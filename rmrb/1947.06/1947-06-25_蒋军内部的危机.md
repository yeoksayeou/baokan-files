　　Crisis Within Chiang's Army
　　Ma Rui
　　In the Chiang army deployed in the Yu-bei (Northern Henan) campaign, incidents of soldiers shooting their superiors are quite common. In April alone, to our knowledge, the following incidents occurred:

　　Li, a relative of Guo Ziying, the commander of the 145th Regiment of the 49th Brigade of the Chiang army, was the commander of the mortar company of that regiment. A few hours before the brigade was annihilated, as the gunfire was raging, he rushed to the artillery position. Platoon Leader Li said very seriously: "It's no good! Commander, the bullets are so dense that the cannons can't be set up... let's surrender!" "Bastard!" The company commander cursed, then shot and killed the platoon leader with a pistol, shouting, "Whoever surrenders will be shot!" The company deputy and Platoon Leader Yang were old colleagues with Platoon Leader Li and were very upset. However, the company commander ordered them to quickly set up the cannons and fire, but five of the six shells fired did not explode, and he scolded them again, saying they were "sabotaging". At this time, Regiment Commander Guo Ziying was wounded, and the company commander rushed to see him. When he was seven or eight steps away from the position, Platoon Leader Yang raised his gun and shot him down, then finished him off with another shot.

　　Song Qi, the commander of the Special Service Company of the 2nd Regiment of the Provisional 3rd Column of the puppet Sun Dianying's forces, while our army was besieging Tangyin, went to inspect the bunker guarded by the 8th squad of that company one night. Upon entering the bunker, he pretended to be responsible and peered out through the gun hole. Squad Leader Zhang Fengshan said very caringly: "Commander! Crouch down! Be careful of stray bullets!" The company commander obediently crouched down. At this time, Zhang Fengshan looked out through the gun hole himself, suddenly calling out: "Commander! Commander! Look, there's a big fire outside!" After saying that, he retreated to the back. The company commander hurriedly came over, and just as his head aligned with the gun hole, "Bang!" A bullet flew from behind, piercing the company commander's head. Soon after, a service member came to inspect the post, and all the soldiers unanimously said: it was a "Communist" bullet that did it.

　　The cause of this incident was: A few days prior, 5th Squad Leader Feng Yishan mobilized the entire squad to "surrender to the Eighth Route Army." Carelessly, he revealed his secret. Company Commander Song Qi immediately called the squad leader to the front of the ranks and said: "...Your crime is worthy of being shot, but considering that you have been with me for eight or nine years..." He then ordered all the squad leaders: "Bring military sticks and give him two hundred strokes." So each squad leader beat him one by one. When it was Squad Leader Zhang Fengshan's turn, he was exhausted after only a dozen or so strokes. The company commander cursed: "Bastard! You're protecting him, you're conspiring with him..." Without asking for any clarification, he beat Zhang Fengshan severely. Zhang Fengshan, harboring resentment, found an opportunity to take revenge that night.

　　When the 554th Regiment of the 185th Brigade of the 66th Division was fighting in Dongyangdian and Gaocun in Qi County, after the 8th Squad Leader of the 7th Company ordered the entire squad to lie down, a private behind him, who hated him on a regular basis, shot and killed him. Zheng Guangxi, the platoon deputy, who was on the roof twenty meters behind the squad, saw this and quietly said to the soldiers he led: "Don't make a fuss when you go down, one death is enough, don't let there be another." (If the superiors know about it, they will definitely execute that private.) Later, the private knew that the platoon deputy had seen it, and was very scared; but the platoon deputy comforted him: "Don't be afraid, it's okay."

　　In the Chiang army deployed in the Yu-bei campaign, this kind of thing is very common. Judging from the above incidents alone, among the broad lower-level officers and soldiers of the Chiang army, widespread war-weariness has begun to develop into concrete anti-war actions. In order to wage the civil war, Chiang Kai-shek is implementing fascist rule in the army - such as the "joint responsibility system" - in an attempt to make the lower-level officers and soldiers who are unwilling to fight in the civil war continue to risk their lives for him. But in fact, it has achieved the opposite result, as can be seen from the three incidents above. Although they all start from the perspective of personal revenge, the soldiers do not oppose the opinion of shouting "surrender"; on the contrary, they all contain a kind of resonance. This point will be greatly developed and deepened under the power of our counter-offensive in the future.

### 蒋军内部的危机

　　蒋军内部的危机
    马瑞
    投入豫北作战的蒋军中，发生枪杀长官的事情颇为普遍，仅四月份一个月内，就我们所知即有以下几件：
    蒋军四十九旅一四五团团长国子英之表叔李某，是该团迫连连长。该旅被歼灭的几个钟头前，枪声正激烈的时候，他慌忙跑到炮兵阵地。李排长很严肃的说：“不行啦！连长，子弹这样密，炮也不能架……我们缴枪吧！”“混蛋！”该连长骂后，接着一手枪将那排长打死，并喊：“谁缴枪就打死谁！”连副及杨排长，都和李排长是老同事，感情好，甚为气愤。连长却命令他们速架炮射击，但射出的六个炮弹，有五个未炸，又被连长训斥了一顿，说他们“搞鬼”。此时团长国子英负伤，连长慌忙去看，离开阵地有七八步远时，杨排长举枪将他打倒，接着又是一枪，就结束了他的生命。
    伪孙殿英部暂编三纵队之六总二团特务连连长宋琪，于我军围困汤阴作战时，某天夜里到该连八班守备的地堡中查哨。进入地堡内，像很负责的从枪眼向外窥探。八班长张凤山很关心似的说：“连长！蹲下吧！小心流弹！”该连长乖乖的蹲下去了。此时张凤山自己从枪眼往外了望，忽然招呼：“连长！连长！你看外边起了大火！”说完即退到后边，连长慌忙过来，把头刚对准枪眼，“叭”的一声，从后边飞来一颗子弹，贯穿了该连长的脑袋。不一会一个服务员又来查哨，全班士兵都一致说：是“共军”子弹打的。
    这件事的起因是：在前不几天，该连五班长冯义山向全班动员“投降八路军去”，不小心，暴露了秘密。连长宋琪即将该班长叫到队前说：“……你的罪过，够上枪毙的，念你跟我有八九年之久……”遂命令各班长：“拿军棍来给我打二百军棍。”于是各班长一五一十的打下去，轮到八班长张凤山啦，只打了十几下，即体疲力竭；连长却骂：“混蛋！”你包庇他，和他同谋……。”不问清红皂白，倒将张凤山痛打一顿。怀恨在心的张凤山，在这天夜里，就找机会报了仇。
    六十六师一八五旅五五四团，在淇县东阳殿、高村作战时，七连八班长指挥全班卧倒后，在他身后的上等兵，因为平日恨他，一枪将他打死。在该班后边二十米远的房顶上，排副郑光喜看到后，向他率领的士兵悄悄的说：“下去不要乱嚷，打死一个就算了，不要再死一个。”（若上边知道时，一定要枪毙那上等兵。）后来该上等兵知道那排副看见了，很害怕；然那排副却安慰他：“不要怕，不要紧。”
    在豫北投入作战的蒋军中，这类事情还多得很。只就上面几件事情看来，在蒋军广大下层官兵中已由普遍厌战开始发展到具体的反战行动。蒋介石为了内战，在部队实行法西斯统治——像“连坐法”等，企图使不愿内战的下层官兵，继续为它拚命。但事实上却得到相反的结果，从上边三个事件即可看出。虽然都是从个人报仇观点出发，但士兵对喊出“投降”的意见并不反对；相反的，却都含有一种共鸣的心情。这一点在今后我反攻之威力下，更会大量发展和深刻化的。
