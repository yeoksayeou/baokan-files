　　Visiting the Model Cooking Squad
　　Yong Jin
　　On the morning of the 29th, the reporter arrived at the famous model cooking squad of the "Qun" unit. As I entered the courtyard, I saw Guo Wenzhong vigorously pulling the bellows. Model cook Hou Jixiang was kneading dough, said to have the skill of kneading dough so well that it wouldn’t stick to the ground if dropped. He is also famous for making millet rice. In the Fifth Company, if it's Old Hou's rice, there’s never any left. The entire "Qun" unit knows that Hou Jixiang’s rice is delicious. He often says, "Think of more ways and put in more effort, so the soldiers can eat their fill and fight Chiang Kai-shek." He can endure hardship, always carrying fifty pounds of supplies during marches. I had just started chatting with Old Hou when Quartermaster Shao Hongda came in from outside, carrying a bundle of green vegetables. The quartermaster is an honest and meticulous person. In the past, their Fifth Company would run a deficit of two to three hundred catties of rice each month. Later, through careful calculation, he found the reason. They used to burn four pots of soup every day when eating rice, using at least eight catties of rice, which amounted to more than two hundred catties a month. He immediately pointed out to the cooks that this was a serious waste and said, "As long as we put in a little more effort, we can save rice, and the soldiers can still eat well." Since then, no matter how far they marched, they would grind flour to make corn bread. When they started eating corn bread, they couldn’t predict the timing of movements, so the bread was either sour or hard. They researched a good method: ferment half of the corn flour and scald the other half with boiling water, so it would never be sour or hard, no matter when. Ma Suxiang’s soup is also particularly famous; the comrades in the Fifth Company would drink their fill during meals and still want two more bowls. During the recent Henan-North battle, the Fifth Company’s meals were different every day for five days, including fried dough sticks, flatbreads, and sweet jujubes. The variety was truly innovative, and the soldiers were happy whenever they saw the cooking squad comrades. When the leaders of the brigade commended them, they gave them cigarettes, but they sent them to the front lines for the soldiers to smoke. Old hero Li Zhifu wrote a ballad praising the cooking squad:
　　"Speaking of the kitchen, talking about the kitchen,
　　The kitchen work is done strongly,
　　There is no shortage of supplies in wartime or peacetime.
　　The rice is good, the vegetables are fragrant,
　　The Fifth Company soldiers eat well, are strong,
　　And drive back the enemy to defend their homeland." (Attached image)

　　访模范炊事班
    勇进
    二十九日上午，记者到了群字部有名的模范炊事班，进院子我便看到了郭文重在呼呼地拉着风箱，模范炊事员侯继香正在和面，据说他有把面和得掉在地上不粘土的本事。他做小米饭也是很有名的，在五连只要说是老侯的米饭，就剩不下，全群字部都知道侯继香的米饭好吃。他也常说，“多想办法多用劲，叫战士吃饱好打蒋介石。”他很能吃苦，行军时身上断不了背五十斤重的东西。我和老侯刚扯了一会儿，司务长邵鸿大从外面抱着一抱青菜来了。司务长是个老实细心的人，过去他们五连每月就要亏空二三百斤米，后来他从仔细的计算中，找到了原因。过去吃米饭每天烧四锅汤，至少用八斤米，一个月就是二百多斤，他马上向炊事员提出了这是一个严重的浪费，并且说：“只要咱们多下点力气，就能节约，战士们还吃得好”此后不管行军多远，都是磨面吃米面馍，开始吃米面馍的时候，说不清什么时候行动，时间上掌握不准，馍不是酸就是硬，他们研究了一个好办法，把米面发一半，另一半用开水烫了，无论什么时候也不酸，也不硬。马素香的汤也是特别有名的，五连同志吃饭时，喝饱了也还是要再加上两碗的。这次豫北战役中，五连的饭五天没有重样，油条饼，枣甜，真是花样翻新，战士们一看到炊事班的同志就高兴起来了。旅的首长嘉奖他们时，送给了他们的纸烟，他们却又送到前线，给战士吸。老英雄李治富写了一首称颂炊事班的快板说：
    “说伙房，道伙房，
    伙房工作搞的强，
    战时平时没有一天缺给养。
    饭又好，菜又香，
    五连战士吃的胖，力气壮，
    杀退敌人保家乡。”（附图片）
