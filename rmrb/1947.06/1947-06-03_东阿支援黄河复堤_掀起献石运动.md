　　Dong'e Supports Yellow River Embankment Repair
    Launches Stone Donation Campaign
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 31st dispatch] The masses in Dong'e are enthusiastically donating stones to support the Yellow River embankment repair project. Li Zhenshan, a cadre from the Fifth District of the Second Zone, donated a stone roller. People's Hero Li Shuhai donated stones he was planning to use to build a house. After cadres held a mass meeting in Niutun Village for group discussion, the masses rushed to donate. Some donated stones from pigsties, others donated memorial stones. Everyone was in high spirits, and the entire group aimed to complete a plan of 20,000 cubic meters. In addition to donating his own stones for building a house, Li Shuhai also mobilized his brother-in-law, Bai Guanhui, to donate 50 large carts of stones. The stone donation campaign in the Fourth District is also progressing enthusiastically. A woman named Xu from Liulizhuang, who was previously very poor, was very happy to have been allocated a house and a plot of land during the land reform. Now, upon hearing the call to donate stones to repair the Yellow River, she immediately donated over 2,500 jin of her stones. Zhang Shucheng, a disabled veteran from Zhang Yening Village, completely donated the 5,500 jin of stones he had reserved for his parents' burial. Zhang Zuowang, a military dependent from Dongsan Guanmiao, is over seventy years old. He donated stones at the mass meeting and said, "I have lived for over seventy years and never lived in a house built with stones. I bought five large carts of stones two years ago to build a house, but now I am donating them because I know how dangerous the Yellow River is."
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 31st dispatch] After the second phase of the embankment repair project began, 8,000 farmers from Fan County arrived at the Yellow River embankment. The original plan was to complete this section of the project in half a month, but after only five days of work, the Dongcang and Zhongzhuang villages in the Fifth District had already completed two-thirds of the entire project. Villages and individuals competed with each other, showing extreme enthusiasm. Every evening, Zhui Zi (a type of folk storytelling) groups, Yangqin (a Chinese dulcimer) groups, and drum groups sang "Anti-Chiang Repairing Dike Ballads" to reduce the fatigue of the dike-building masses. Each team used loudspeakers to broadcast daily summaries of work and commend model workers. County Magistrate Chen and District Chief Wang of the Fifth District personally participated in dike repair, pushing earth alongside the masses. They were so exhausted that they were covered in sweat, but they still didn't rest. The masses said, "In the past, officials supervised work, but now the county magistrate pushes earth with us. He is truly a county magistrate for the people." Zhang Tian, from Wang Yingzhuang, is fifty-three years old but still works very hard to carry earth. Bai Tang and Bai Xingchao carry as much earth in one cart as others carry in two, and the masses all recognize him as a "Dike-Building Hero."
