　　Postal Workers Throughout the Country Perform Meritorious Service for the People
    Everyone Strives to Be a "Flying General"
    Jixian Postal Bureau Employees Help Each Other to Speed Up Postal Delivery
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since the Taihang postal bureaus implemented the night shift system in April and designated May as "Aviation Month," the speed of newspaper distribution has greatly increased. Linxian, which used to take three days to see the newspaper, now only takes one day, and Yangcheng has been reduced from eight days to four days. On the branch lines, such as Yushe to Qixian and Taigu, it originally took two days, but now it only takes one day. In counties such as Changzhi, the rural postal routes have changed from an every-other-day newspaper delivery system to a daily system, and night shifts have been added. The speed has been increased by one to two times everywhere. After the newspapers arrive, they are distributed to counties and districts on the same day, and are not stored in the post office. During "Aviation Month," many "Flying Generals" emerged. Many postal workers travel hundreds of miles a day, carrying weights of sixty to seventy pounds. Postal workers such as Lanyangtian from Cixian, Sang Xinxi from Anyang, Liang Chengyuan from Heshun, Hou Jinlong from Changzhi, and Li Chunxi from Linqi, all travel one hundred forty to fifty miles a day. Chen Ruhua, an old postal worker from Qinyang, had sores on his legs, and walked eighty-five miles in half a day to deliver newspapers to Qinnan. Others such as Li Jinsuo from Changzhi carrying ninety pounds, and Zhang Xiaosi from Shexian carrying eighty-six pounds. Every postal worker demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm. The Taihang Postal Headquarters specially made a record of merits and work in April in the "Taihang Post" to commend the models.
    [Reported by this newspaper from Jixian] In order to respond to the General Post Office's call to "Perform meritorious service for the people and support the patriotic self-defense war as quickly as possible," so that newspapers and mail can reach the soldiers at the front as soon as possible, all employees of the Jixian Postal Bureau voluntarily changed the every-other-day schedule of the postal routes in various districts and townships to a daily schedule, and delivered newspapers and mail directly to the troops at the front, so that the People's Daily could be seen by the troops one day earlier. They also felt that the newspaper was delayed by one day because it stopped overnight at Linqi Station, so they automatically changed the seventy-mile mountain road from Linqi to Tagang to a night shift from the 27th. Postal workers Yan Jingtang and Zhang Shuzhong took the lead in setting an example. They set off on the night of the 27th, and encountered rain and muddy roads all the way. They did not avoid hardship, and returned to Tagang overnight on the 28th. Because the work changed and the postal workers could not rest, Bureau Chief Bai mobilized the cadres of the whole bureau to help the postal workers, and personally went on a business trip with postal worker Du Piyi, returning before dawn, which further promoted everyone's enthusiasm. Postal worker Du Yanwei also decided to help the postal workers and go on business trips at night. Everyone overcame the difficulties of having no lights, no weapons, and no water to drink at night, and insisted on the night shift, so that the People's Daily of the 2nd arrived at the front on the 5th, two days faster than in the past.

　　各地邮工为民立功
    个个争做“飞毛腿”
    汲县邮局员工互助加速邮递
    【本报讯】太行各邮局自从四月份实行了夜班制，并把五月份定为“飞机月”以来，报纸的发行速度大大提高。林县过去三天才能看到报纸，现在仅需一天，阳城从八天减到四天。支线上，如榆社到祁县、太谷原来两天，现在只用一天。长治等县的乡邮线由隔日送报制改为逐日制，并增加夜班。各处都已增快了一倍至二倍。报纸到达后，当天即分发县区，在邮局不存搁。在“飞机月”中涌现了不少的“飞毛腿”，邮工同志日行百里，担重六七十斤者极多。磁县的兰阳田、安阳桑新喜、和顺梁成元、长治侯金龙、临淇李春喜等邮工同志，一天都要走一百四五十里路。沁阳老邮工陈如华同志腿上有疮，往沁南送报，半日走了八十五里。其他如长治的李金锁担九十斤，涉县张小四担八十六斤等。每个邮工同志发挥了高度积极性。太行邮总局特在《太行邮报》上作了四月份评功记工，表扬了模范。
    【本报汲县讯】为了响应总局号召“为民立功，如快速度支援爱国自卫战争”，使报纸邮件早日到达前方将士手里，汲县邮政局全体员工自愿将各区乡邮线之隔日班期，改为逐日班期，并将报纸邮件直接投递到前方部队，这样人民日报可使部队早看一天。又感到报纸在临淇站停一夜慢了一天，即将临淇到塔岗的七十里山路自二十七号起自动改为夜班。邮工阎景唐、张恕忠首先起模范，于廿七号晚上出发，正遇天下雨满路泥泞，他们不避艰苦，二十八号一夜就返回塔岗来了。因为工作变化邮工休息不过来，白局长就动员了全局干部帮助邮工，并亲自和邮务员杜丕义同志出差，返回届时天还不明，更推动了大家的热情。邮务员杜彦伟同志也决心与邮工互助，夜间出差。大家克服着没灯没武器，夜间没水喝的困难，坚持夜班，使二号的人民日报五号即到前方，比过去快两天。
