　　Specifically Eliminate Ideological Concerns
    Baishan Masses Divide Land and Protect Wheat
    [Our paper Bo'ai News] After the democratic government in Baishan Village, a border area of Bo'ai, confiscated the land of fleeing traitors and despots and distributed it to the masses, the morale of the masses has greatly stabilized, and the struggle to divide the land and protect wheat has begun. There are 120 households in Baishan Village who fled to the city, most of whom work for the enemy in the city, which puts great pressure on the masses. The democratic government resolutely stood up for the masses, confiscated the property of 30 die-hard traitors and local bullies, and distributed it to poor peasants, while leaving the property and land of the remaining 90 households untouched in order to win them back. At the beginning of the land distribution, a meeting of poor people was convened, and it was found that the masses had three concerns: 1. Fear of getting into trouble. 2. Fear of heavy burden. 3. Too busy with errands to take care of it. Among them, the fear of getting into trouble was still the main one. The leadership studied these ideas and decided to educate the masses to consciously and voluntarily ask for land, and immediately solved the problems separately. For those who were afraid of getting into trouble, it was explained to them: 1. Land is a treasure pot. Having land is a complete transformation. It is reasonable and legal for the poor to get land. The government takes the lead, and the workers and everyone else will persevere in the struggle together. 2. The enemy came to Baishan eight times, robbing things and arresting people. Those who did not divide the land also got into trouble. The root of the trouble is the enemy, not the land. Only by revealing their faces and fighting can we survive. 3. Everyone cultivates, and there is strength in numbers. It was also guaranteed that the burden would be fair and reasonable, and that the poor would not suffer. The errands are unified and adjusted by the district, and the scope of errands is expanded, reducing the number of people supporting the errands from ten to three each day. After such mobilization and discussion, more than a dozen households in the two villages signed up to ask for land, and specified that "I dare to cultivate the land of the big bully." Several other villages also signed up to ask for land, and after receiving the slips from the village office, they all helped each other to cut wheat. The next day, another meeting of poor people was held, and more than 40 more households asked for land. After the land was distributed, the struggle to protect wheat was launched. Everyone mobilized their children and wives to work together. The cadres went deep into the villages to specifically divide the work and organize the masses, promote the organization of mutual aid groups, cutting in the morning, threshing in the afternoon, and hiding at night, concentrating militia to guard with arms, and going up the mountain to stand guard before dawn. When there was a situation, the district cadre team reinforced, insisted on fighting, harvesting, and protecting the masses, and completed the wheat at the mountain pass within two days, which greatly improved the morale of the masses.

　　具体解除思想顾虑
    柏山群众分田保麦
    【本报博爱讯】博爱边沿区柏山村经民主政府没收逃亡奸霸土地分给群众后，群众情绪已大为稳定，展开了分田保麦斗争。柏山村逃到城里的有一二○户，大部在城里给敌人做事，对群众压力很大，民主政府坚决为群众作主，将死心蹋地的汉奸恶霸三十户的财产没收，分给贫苦农民，其余九十户的财产土地不动争取他们回头。分田开始，召集穷人开会，发现群众有三种顾虑：一、怕惹祸。二、怕负担重。三、差务忙顾不过来。其中怕惹祸的思想还是主要的，领导上研究了这些思想，决定教育群众自觉自愿要地，当即分头解决。对于怕惹祸的向其解释：一、土地是聚宝盆，有了土地才算翻透身，穷人得地合理合法，政府作主，工作员和大家一块坚持斗争。二、敌人来柏山八次，抢东西捉人，没分地的人也招祸，祸根是敌人而不是土地，只有揭破脸斗争才能生存。三、大家都种，人多力量大。并保证公平的合理负担，不让穷人吃亏。差务由区上统一调剂，扩大支差面，每天由十个人支应减为三个，经过这样动员讨论，二村便有十几户报名要地，并且指名要，“我敢种大恶霸的那块地”。其他几个村也随着报名要地，到村公所领了条子，便都互助割起麦子来。第二天再开穷人会，要地的又有四十多家。分田后即展开保麦斗争，全体动员孩子老婆一起干，干部深入各村具体分工组织群众、推动组织互助组，上午割、下午打、黑夜藏，集中民兵武装保卫，天不明就上山站岗，有情况时区干队增援，坚持打收并掩护群众，两天内完成山口的麦子，群众情绪大大提高。
