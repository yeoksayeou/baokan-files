　　Ningyang and Changqing Clear Ideological Obstacles
    Guerrilla Warfare Victoriously Unfolds
    [Our newspaper's dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu, 20th] The guerrilla warfare in Ningyang and Changqing has victoriously unfolded. Ningyang, at a county-wide cadre meeting, proposed opposing right-leaning retreatist thought, eradicating the idea of a large-scale withdrawal, and smashing the arguments that belittled the masses. It was declared that to resist the "mopping-up operations" and "suppression," cadres must resolutely stay at their posts. Cadres from the Fifth District said, "The goodness of the masses is only revealed through the good leadership of the cadres. As long as we do our work well, the masses of Ningyang will be mobilized." With the majority of steadfast cadres taking the lead, the minority of cadres with retreatist thoughts also became active. All cadres immediately cooperated with the armed forces to persist in their respective districts. Currently, cadres from the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Districts can lead small units to independently persist in the struggle, especially in the Third and Seventh Districts, and have carried out work such as counter-liquidation, land investigation, land clearing, public grain collection, and preferential treatment for military families. With the active operations of our troops, the puppet regime has no way to gain a foothold. The puppet district office of the Fourth District has been compressed to near the city, the puppet district office of the Seventh District has been compressed to the Huaguan area, and the puppet district office of the Third District has been compressed to the Sixth District area. The puppet district office of the Fifth District operates south of Sanshandian during the day and flees back near the county seat in the afternoon. Small groups of enemy and puppets are extremely panicked, and our positions are gradually being consolidated. The situation in Ningyang has begun to change. The cadres of Changqing have consistently maintained a spirit of active struggle. The Third, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Districts have organized armed work teams, which have twice repelled the enemy's "Homecoming Corps." The armed work team of the Eighth District captured more than ten enemy telephone operators and seized four dynamos. Currently, all districts are further controlling landlords, raising the consciousness of the masses, consolidating rural positions, and taking the guerrilla war a step further.

　　宁阳长清扫清思想障碍
    游击战争胜利展开
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】宁阳、长清的游击战争已胜利展开，宁阳在全县干部大会上提出反对右倾退缩思想，根绝大转移的想法，粉碎轻视群众的一些论调，要反“扫荡”，反“清剿”，一定坚持岗位。五区干部说：“群众好是干部领导的好才能表现出来的，我们只要作好工作，宁阳群众是会干起来的。”多数坚定干部一带头，少数有退缩思想的干部也积极起来。全体干部当即配合武装进行分区坚持。目前三、四、五、七等区干部均能带领小部队单独坚持斗争，特别是三、七区，并进行了反倒算查田清地公粮及优军工作。在我部队积极活动下，伪政权已没法立足。四区伪区公所已被压缩到城附近去，七区伪区公所被压缩到花观一带，三区伪区公所被压到六区一带，五区伪区公所白天到三山店以南活动，下午即跑回县城附近。小股敌伪已极度恐慌，我们的阵地已逐渐巩固起来，宁阳的局面已开始转变。长清干部始终是保持了积极斗的精神，三、六、七、八区组织了武工队，曾两次击退敌“还乡团”，八区武工队捉敌电话员十多名，缴获电机四部。目前各区都在进一步控制地主，提高群众觉悟，巩固农村阵地，把游击战争提高一步。
