Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. TASS, Copenhagen: The news that the Danish government has formally requested to begin negotiations with the U.S. government to abolish the Greenland Agreement has been welcomed by the Danish people. At the same time, Marshall's statement is disappointing. The newspaper *Land og Folk* writes: "The United States must know that the Danish government's note represents the firm wishes of the Danish and Greenlandic people. At a press conference on May 29th, Marshall said: The United States is prepared to negotiate a new agreement, and the interests of Danish sovereignty and the defense requirements of the United States and the Western Hemisphere should be fully considered in the agreement. We should immediately explain to Marshall that the Danish side will not accept this proposal, because where foreign troops and foreign bases exist, 'sovereignty' is completely illusory."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS, Copenhagen: On the morning of May 23rd, a group of Danish youths held a demonstration in front of the Spanish Embassy in Copenhagen. They held up banners with the slogans: "The struggle of the Spanish people is our struggle!" "Down with fascism!" "Down with Franco!" "Long live the Spanish guerrillas!" "Long live free Spain!" "Break off relations with Franco!"

　　丹麦人民拥护政府与美商议
    废除格陵兰协定
    青年示威游行反对法西斯西班牙
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社哥本哈根讯：丹麦政府正式要求与美国政府开始商谈废除格陵兰协定之消息，获得丹麦人民之欢迎。同时，马歇尔之声明令人大失所望。《兰德奥格·合束克》报写道：“美国须知丹麦政府之照会，系表示丹麦与格陵兰人民之坚定的愿望。马歇尔于五月二十九日的记者招待会上说：美国准备商议新协定，而丹麦主权之利益与美国及西半球防务之要求当在协定中充分予以考虑。我们应即向马歇尔说明：丹麦方面将不接受此种提议。因为在外国军队与外国基地存在的地方，‘主权’就完全是虚幻的。”
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社哥本哈根讯：五月二十三日晨一群丹麦青年于哥本哈根的西班牙公使馆门前举行示威游行，他们高擎着标语，上书：“西班牙人民的斗争就是我们的斗争！”“打倒法西斯主义！”，“打倒佛朗哥！”“西班牙游击队万岁！”，“自由西班牙万岁！”“与佛朗哥断绝关系！”
