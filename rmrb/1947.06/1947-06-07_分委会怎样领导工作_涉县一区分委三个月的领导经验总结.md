How a Sub-Committee Leads Work
    ——Summary of the Leadership Experience of the First District Sub-Committee in She County over Three Months
    Qiao Yong

    The work in the first district of She County was once dull for a period. All work fell on the village cadres. Many village cadres did not implement the instructions, or they did things according to their own ideas, regardless of whether they were right or wrong. District cadres could not persuade them to listen. District cadres could only run from village to village, listening to the village cadres' random reports on the situation, copying some unconfirmed figures and bringing them back, considering the work done. Sometimes, even after work was done and a large amount of facts were recorded, they could not figure out what the problem was, what the lessons learned were. When work could not be carried out, they could not think of solutions, lost confidence in the work, and had no interest. As a result, some wanted to go home, some were dazed all day, and some complained that the superiors' leadership was not specific enough.
    How to break this deadlock? Based on three months of leadership experience, the following points are made:
    I. Affirm the cadres' enthusiasm for work, do not make negative accusations, and specifically help them absorb experience and lessons from their actual work, bit by bit. Generally, working comrades are willing to do their work well. They are not deliberately lazy. Everyone often eats and sleeps poorly for the sake of work, and they are often covered in sweat. They want to do well but cannot, so they should not be blamed. Instead, the leading comrades have not fulfilled their responsibility to help them find the right path. If they cannot break the deadlock for a long time, they lose confidence in their work. The work tasks are piled on top of them one after another, making it even more difficult to achieve results, and their enthusiasm decreases day by day. At this time, leading comrades must provide specific assistance, research and think of solutions with them in their work, and improve their ability and courage. Do not just leave them there without care and then demand tasks when the time comes. For example, Li Wende could not open up the situation while working in Chikan. The leadership immediately sent comrades to work with him, making him clear on a bit of experience after doing a bit, and helping him plan a section after completing a section. They discussed in private and let him take the lead, helping him establish prestige among the masses. In this way, he made rapid progress and was soon able to work independently.
    Another point is to pay close attention to reporting and inspection, and to immediately write back to answer questions. If cadres feel that a certain point is well done, let them write about that point. If they cannot write, ask primary school teachers for help. After the leadership reads it, they must write back, explaining where his progress is and helping him further clarify one or two experiences. When writing letters, the characters must be written clearly and not hastily. Sometimes, good experiences are introduced to other base points. This not only exchanges experiences but also encourages the cadres' morale. Each report should be saved for summary at the next meeting so that one can see a cadre's progress each time.
    II. How to hold meetings?
    In the past, everyone felt that there was nothing to say at meetings. If they had to say something, it was just a lot of phenomena, and they could not explain the core of the problem themselves. I would not listen to you, and you would not listen to him. In the end, the leadership summarized a set of ideas, but the worker-peasant comrades did not take notes. Even if they understood a few points and felt it was possible at the time, they thought they had a solution this time. However, as soon as they went to their work village and came into contact with the actual situation, they did not know which one to use. Although the meeting was long and the content was plentiful, the problem was that specific problems were not resolved. Now this practice has been changed. The sub-committee usually pays attention to understanding the development of the movement and the characteristics of various types of villages. When holding meetings, find several different problems, and after reporting, start a discussion to find solutions. In this way, arranging the various types of villages, discussing them one by one, clarifying them step by step, similar experiences can be exchanged, and different experiences can also be consulted.
    Discussing by type and solving problems separately can make everyone remember clearly, pay attention to listening, and think carefully about the work in their own village. The leadership uses the face of the masses to guide everyone to clarify their experiences bit by bit, paying special attention to clarifying the main experiences, not too many. The summary should also be simple, and the summary should be closely focused on the issues and facts discussed so that everyone can hear it familiarly and easily remember it.
    III. How to establish merit? Establishing merit is to summarize everyone's experience and progress, promote good ideology and work style, and promote advantages. It is not simply criticism, but mainly looking at cadres from their work, and not going around in circles on trivial matters in life. For example, Comrade Fan Jintang is good at grasping the masses' thoughts in Huili Village and mobilizing the poor and backward masses. The village cadres are very satisfied, which is a good method. Comrade Nai Shun is also good at grasping thoughts and can also find poor and hired laborers, but he does not know how to mobilize them. He then learned the experience of mobilizing the masses from Comrade Jintang. In this way, everyone is in high spirits, and comrades with many shortcomings do not need to be directly criticized, but are transformed through conscious self-criticism. For example, after listening to everyone's achievements and experiences, one comrade thought he was too poor and was very ashamed. He said that he was not as good as anyone and that his thinking had regressed since he married his wife. He stole home once, took a day off once, and stayed at home for seven days. He was almost ashamed to cry.
    IV. Strengthen the leadership of the sub-committee. How to make the entire sub-committee responsible for the work of the entire district, give full play to everyone's enthusiasm, care about the overall work, and realize the core leadership of the entire district is a major issue. The first district does this: First, hold more sub-committee meetings. Before the meeting, prepare in advance, study the situation more, be truly responsible for the work of each base point, and be responsible for the meeting. Second, the sub-secretary should let go of using cadres and conduct individual talks with all sub-committee comrades based on different work and different people to exchange leadership opinions, improve their work ability, and give play to everyone's creativity and enthusiasm so that the entire sub-committee forms the core leadership of the entire district. All sub-committee comrades should approach comrades who are slow to progress more and cannot only like those who are progressing quickly. In this way, they can better understand the ideological situation of each comrade. For example, one comrade had just returned from the war and was made to attend a meeting without rest. He was unhappy, and another comrade discovered it. The sub-committee comrade immediately talked to him, explaining that he was afraid that he would not be able to keep up with the work if he did not participate. Because of this mutual care and mutual help, the consciousness and sense of responsibility of each cadre were inspired, and the work suddenly became active.

　　分委会怎样领导工作
    ——涉县一区分委三个月的领导经验总结
    乔勇
    涉县一区工作曾经沉闷了一个时期，一切工作走到村干部身上，很多村干部不执行，或者按着他的想法去做，不管对不对，区干部说服也不听。区干部只能从这村跑到那村，由村干部随便说些情况，抄些不确实的数字带回来，就算完事。有时就是做了工作，记了一大堆事实，也研究不出来啥问题，啥是经验教训，工作搞不起来时，也想不出办法，对工作失掉了信心，没有兴趣。于是有的想回家，有的一天昏昏沉沉，有的埋怨上级领导不具体。
    怎样打开这种局面呢？根据三个月来的领导经验，有下列几点：
    一、肯定干部的工作热情，不作消极的责备，从一点一滴的实际工作中，具体帮助他们吸收经验教训。一般工作同志都是愿意把工作做好的，不是故意逃懒，大家经常为工作吃不好、睡不好，常是满头大汗，想做好而又做不好，是不能责备这些同志的，而是领导同志没有尽到帮助的责任，帮他找到门路，长期打不开局面，失掉了工作信心，而工作任务又是一个一个往头上压，越发做不出成绩，积极性就越发一天天减低了。这时领导同志必须具体帮助，在工作上和他研究想办法，提高他的能力与勇气。不是摆在那里不管，到时候要任务。如李文德同志在赤岸工作，打不开局面，领导上即派同志和他一同去做，做一点让他明确一点经验，做完一段，帮他计划一段，背地商议，让他出头，帮助他在群众中建立威信。这样，他进步得很快，不久就能独立工作了。
    再一点就是抓紧汇报检查，即时写回信解答问题。干部在下边感到那一点做得好就让他写那一点，不会写的请小学教员帮助。领导上看了以后无论如何要去回信，说明他的进步在那里，帮助他更加明确一两个经验。写信时，字要写得清楚，不能了草。有时好的经验，即向其他基点介绍。这样，既交换了经验，又鼓励了干部情绪，并将每次汇报保存起来，下次会议时好做总结，可以看出一个干部一次一次的进步。
    二、怎样开会？
    过去开会，大家感到没啥说，要说也只是一大堆现象，自己也说不明白问题的中心。我说你不听，你说他不听，最后领导上总结一套，工农同志不会笔记，就是了解几条，当下心里明白，觉着可以，以为这次下去可有了办法。但一走到自己的工作村，一接触实际情况就不知运用那个好了。会议的时间虽长，内容虽多，但毛病却在没有解决具体问题。现在改变了这种做法，分委平常即注意了解运动的发展情况与各个不同类型村的特点，开会时各找几个不同的问题，汇报后，即展开讨论，求得解决。这样将各类型村排列下去，逐类讨论，步步明确，同类经验可以交流，不同经验也可以参考。
    这样分类型讨论，分别解决问题，可使大家记得清楚，也注意听，用心考虑自己村的工作。领导上以群众面貌诱导大家一点一点的明确经验，特别注意明确主要的经验，不宜过多。总结也要简单，而且总结应该紧紧抓住讨论过的问题和事实，使大家听到熟悉，容易记住。
    三、怎样立功？立功就是总结各人的经验进步，发扬好的思想作风，发扬优点，不是单纯的批评，主要是从工作上看干部，不要在生活琐事上转圈子。如樊金堂同志，在会里村工作会摸群众的心思，将贫困落后群众发动起来，村干部都很满意，是个很好的方法。乃顺同志会摸心思，也能找到贫雇落后，但不会把他们发动起来，他就向金堂同志学习发动群众的经验。这样大家情绪很高，对缺点多的同志也不用直接批评，也从自觉的检讨中转变了。如一个同志听了大家的成绩和经验后，想到自己太差，非常惭愧，他说我谁也不如，说自己自从娶了老婆思想落后了，偷回家一次，一次请了一天假，回家住了七天。他简直惭愧得要哭起来。
    四、加强分委会领导。怎样使全体分委对全区工作负责，发挥大家的积极性，关心全面工作，实现全区核心领导，是个大问题。一区是这样做的，首先是多开分委会，开会前，预先准备，多研究情况，对各基点工作真正负责，对会议负责。再就是分书要放手运用干部，对所有分委同志也根据不同工作不同人多作个别谈话，交换领导意见，提高他的工作能力，发挥每个人的创造性积极性，使整个分委形成全区的领导核心。而所有分委同志要多多接近进步慢的同志，不能只喜欢进步的，这样就能更好的了解各个同志的思想情况。如有个同志刚参战回来，没有休息，就让他参加开会，他不高兴，被另一个同志发觉了，分委同志马上找他谈话，说明不参加怕工作接不上茬。由于这种互相关心，互相帮助，启发了每个干部的自觉和责任心，工作顿时显得活跃。
