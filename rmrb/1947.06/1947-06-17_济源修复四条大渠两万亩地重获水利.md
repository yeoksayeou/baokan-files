【Our Newspaper Taiyue 15th Dispatch】 This spring, Jiyuan extensively dredged its canals. Four of the Five Dragons have been restored, now capable of irrigating over 20,000 mu of land. The Zhulong River has also been dredged, rescuing 3,000 mu of submerged farmland. Jiyuan's first, second, and third districts are all plains, with the Qin River and Ji River (Zhulong River) intertwined. Among them are five major canals: the first is called Lifeng Canal, the second Yongli Canal, the third Guangji Canal, the fourth Guanglin Canal, and the fifth Guanghui Canal. These five canals are collectively known as the "Five Dragons," with a very extensive irrigation area, capable of irrigating 437 qing of land in Jiyuan alone. After the War of Resistance, they were repeatedly damaged by Japanese invaders, the channels silted up, and water overflowed, destroying many fertile fields. After the implementation of land reform last year, the local government immediately began preparations for repairs, appealing to higher authorities for a loan of 4 million yuan. This spring, work began, and four of the Dragons have now been restored. The masses are highly motivated. For example, the Guanghui Canal is 18 li long, originally estimated to require 20,000 labor days, but it was completely repaired with only 14,400 labor days. Initially, Shangzhuang Village, Xianghua Village, and Renzhai Village issued a challenge, stating that whoever failed to complete the work on time would provide one pig and one sheep each. Seeing that they were about to fall behind, Shangzhuang mobilized all 700 households, men, women, and children, working all night for the last three days. By dawn, they had also completed their work. The Lifeng Canal is 32.5 li long and can irrigate 10,200 mu of land. After repairs, it can now irrigate nearly one-half. The Yongli Canal is 40 li long and can irrigate 250 qing of land, and it has now been dredged. The Guangji Canal has also been dredged and can irrigate more than 2,400 mu of land. From April 17th to May 20th, the Zhulong River was also dredged in the Niushe, Xihu, and Lilin sections, which will increase the irrigated area by 3,000 mu next spring. In total, Jiyuan's restoration work, up to the present, has enabled the irrigation of over 20,000 mu of land, increasing the masses' confidence in overcoming natural disasters. There are several experiences from the river repair process: First, it is necessary to reform the old river management personnel and have liberated peasants participate in leadership because these old river management personnel have deeply ingrained bad habits, causing significant losses to the work. Since the peasants themselves took over management, the old rules were broken, upstream and downstream areas took care of each other, resolving mutual disputes and ensuring the smooth progress of the work. Second, leading cadres personally took action, taking the lead in working, which inspired the masses. The masses all said, "This is our own work, and the cadres are working so hard, we should work even harder." As a result, many women also volunteered to participate in river repair. Third, accurate calculations and more ideas were used. For example, in the past, the stones used for repairing the Guanghui Canal had to be carried from the mountains. This year, they came up with a method of using rafts to pull stones across the river, which was both labor-saving and fast.

　　济源修复四条大渠两万亩地重获水利
    【本报太岳十五日电】济源今春大疏河渠，五龙已恢复四龙，现已能浇地两万余亩。并挖通猪龙河，救出被淹田地三千亩。济源一、二、三区都是平原，沁水、济水（猪龙河）纵横交流，其中有五道大渠，第一道叫利丰渠，第二道永利渠，第三道广济渠，第四道广霖渠，第五道广惠渠，这五渠合称“五龙”，灌溉面积极广，仅济源境就可浇地四百三十七顷。抗战以后，屡遭日寇破坏，渠道淤塞，积水横流，不少良田竟被冲毁。去年实行土地改革后，当地政府即着手筹备修复，吁请上级贷款四百万元，于今春与工现已修复四龙，群众情绪高涨，如广惠渠长十八里，原预计二万人工，但只用了一万四千四百个人工便全部修通，开始时尚庄向化村、留村、任寨三村发出挑战书，谁不能定期完工输猪、羊各一口，尚庄看见快要落伍，在最后三天，全村七百户，所有男女老幼一齐动手，整整作了一夜，赶天明他们也完工了，利丰渠长达三十二里半，可浇地一万零二百亩，经过修理之后，已可浇地将近二分之一；永利渠长四十里，可浇田二百五十顷，现在也已挖通，广济渠亦已挖运，能浇地二千四百余亩；猪龙河自四月十七日至五月二十日，也在牛社、西湖、梨林地段挖通，明春可增加水地面积三千亩。总计济源恢复旧的工作，截至目前止，已能浇地二万余亩，提高了群众战胜灾荒的信心。在修河当中，有这样几个经验：一、必须改造旧河务人员，由翻身农民自己参加领导，因为这些旧河务人员恶习甚深，工作受损失很大，自改由农民自己来管理以后，打破了老规矩，上下游互相照顾，解决了互相纠纷，使工作顺利进行。二、领导干部亲自动手，带头做工，激励了群众情绪，群众都说：“这是咱自己的活，干部都是这样下力，我们更应好好干”，因而许多妇女也都自愿参加修河。三、精确计算，多想办法，如广惠渠过去修河用的石头得到山上去抬，今年他们研究出办法，用木筏在河对面拉石头，又省工又快。
