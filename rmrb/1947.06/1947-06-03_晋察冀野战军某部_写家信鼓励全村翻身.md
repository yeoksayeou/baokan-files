Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 31st: Our reporter Wang Huide reports: To thoroughly implement the land reform movement, a unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army held a meeting of cadres above the platoon level on the 19th and 20th of this month to discuss how the army can help with land reform, calling on all commanders and fighters to raise their class consciousness and to "boost the morale of the peasants and destroy the prestige of the landlords." After a regiment of the unit conveyed the report at a general meeting of all soldiers, the commanders and fighters present cheered and applauded enthusiastically for a long time. Soldiers from poor peasant backgrounds in the unit voluntarily performed Yangko dances after the meeting and immediately composed and sang ballads about land reform everywhere. In recent days, a large number of new activists have emerged in various units. New soldiers who have just come from the countryside have been enthusiastically talking about land reform at various meetings, tirelessly. Li Dewu, a new soldier in a unit, whose family has already been allocated land, solemnly declared to everyone: "I will resolutely carry it through to the end, defend the land and defend the fruits of victory." Commanders and fighters from various units have also been writing letters to their hometowns, encouraging land struggles in their villages. Comrades from landlord backgrounds have been writing home, advising their families to implement the laws and meet the land demands of the peasants. Comrade Zhou Derun, director of the Direct Political Department, has written a letter advising his family to return all their property to the peasants. Wang Zhanjiang, the secretary of the Second Battalion of a regiment, had his family's property confiscated. His brother came to report the news and asked him to go back and recover some of it. He not only immediately refused but also explained to his brother the justice and legitimacy of land reform. Furthermore, cadres and soldiers of the Ji-Jin Military Region Political Department have participated in the land reform movement in their stationed areas to help peasants to stand up. Prior to this, the department had convened a conference to review its position. Some individual cadres had sympathy for landlords. After the organization held a grievance meeting, where comrades from worker and peasant backgrounds recounted the facts of being exploited and oppressed by landlords, leading to the destruction of their families, every comrade was filled with indignation. The enthusiasm for supporting the peasants' emancipation surged, and nine groups were immediately organized to conduct in-depth visits to the stationed villages. Many comrades from landlord backgrounds also wrote letters home to educate their families.
