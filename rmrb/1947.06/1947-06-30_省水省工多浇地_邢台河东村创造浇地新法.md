　　Saving Water, Saving Labor, Irrigating More Land
    Hedong Village, Xingtai, Creates New Irrigation Method
    [Reported by this newspaper] During the wheat harvest, Hedong Village in the 9th District of Xingtai calculated that the village had 272 mu of wheat farming land susceptible to both waterlogging and drought, and 130 mu of land suffering from spring drought, totaling 402 mu of land that had not yet been sown. Due to the drought and water supply difficulties, the masses were very anxious. On the 19th of this month, a mass meeting was convened to study how to sow these 402 mu of land. During the discussion, several solutions were devised: First, all the ponds and the areas above the "po ge tai" (small earthen platforms) in the village were channeled into ditches. This would empty the water completely, expand the water source, and collect more water. Second, change the method of irrigating waterlogged land. Instead of flooding the land, divert the water into the fields. Dig a ditch on top of the ridges, and dig small hoe pits. Divert the water into the ditch, and hoe small pits on both sides of the ridges to water the crops with ladles. In this way, one ditch of water can irrigate two ridges. After watering these two ridges, open a ditch on another ridge and continue. This method is very fast and saves a lot of labor. According to a calculation from a pond in the west of the village: irrigating 35 mu of land would, if flooding was used, require two irrigations a day, irrigating only 0.8 mu. Calculating for 35 mu, it would take 44 days to complete. Using the above method, 6 mu can be irrigated per day, and the entire area can be irrigated in 6 days. According to this plan, all the waterlogged land in the village should be sown, and the land that cannot be irrigated should be dry-sown. The entire village is divided into three drainage ditches, and Wang Aiqin and two others are selected to be responsible for leading the masses in digging river ditches and expanding water sources. Each group is also challenging each other, and a campaign to rush-sow is underway.

　　省水省工多浇地
    邢台河东村创造浇地新法
    【本报讯】邢台九区河东村在麦收中计算，全村有水旱地二百七十二亩麦耕地，春旱地一百三十亩，共四百零二亩地还没有下种，但由于天旱水力困难，在群众思想上也很恐慌，在本月十九日即召开群众会，研究如何使这四百零二亩地下种，在研究中想出几个办法：一、把全村所有的池和泼圪台上边挑成沟，这样使水空净，扩大水源多集水。二、水地改变水阴办法，把水改到地里，把畦圪碾上边挖上个沟，挖些小耪窑，把水改到沟里，两边畦子用锄耪成窑，用瓢浇水，这样一沟水可以点两畦，点完这两个畦再从另一畦圪上开沟碾，这样点的很快，又省工很多，据村西一个池统计：浇着三十五亩地，如要放水阴地，一天放两次，能阴八分地，三十五亩计算得四十四天才能种完。使用以上办法，每天浇六亩，六天就浇完了。这样计划全村所有水地都要种上，不能种的要干种上，全村共分三道泷沟，并选出王爱芹等三人各负一责，领导群众挖河沟，扩大水源，各组并互相挑战，正在突击下种。
