　　Our Army's Spearhead Points Towards the Outskirts of Shenyang
    South Manchuria Recovers Qingyuan and Xinbin
    South of Changchun Recaptures Yitong County Seat
    [Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong Front, Urgent Telegram, 3rd] The Southeast Manchuria Democratic Allied Army, today (3rd), recovered the county towns of Qingyuan and Xinbin, and Yongling Street, a Chiang army stronghold west of Xinbin, without firing a single shot. The defending enemy abandoned the city and fled west, and are being pursued and annihilated along different routes. These towns were once relied upon by Du Yuming as staging grounds for four offensives against the Liaodong Liberated Area. Before August (occupied by Chiang's 52nd Army in the upper and middle of October last year), they have now returned to the hands of the people. Now, the entire section of the Shenyang-Jilin line south of Jilin and north of Qingyuan, and the Siping-Meihekou line, except for the isolated city of Xi'an on the Siping-Meihekou line, which is still besieged by the Democratic Allied Army, the vast area has been completely liberated. Fushun, an important strategic stronghold on the outskirts of Shenyang, and Yingpan to its east, have been completely exposed to the huge spearhead of General Lin Biao's troops.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th] A unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Yitong County on the 2nd. The city is located more than 120 li south of Changchun, and the defending enemy abandoned the city and fled. Note: Yitong was occupied by Chiang's 71st Army on May 21st last year.

　　我军矛头指向沈阳外围
    南满收复清原新宾
    长春以南光复伊通县城
    【新华社辽东前线三日急电】东南满民主联军，今（三）日不费一弹，收复清原、新宾两县城及新宾西之蒋军据点永陵街，守敌弃城西窜，正分路追歼中。上述城镇，杜聿明曾恃以作四犯辽东解放区之屯兵场，未及八月（去年十月上、中旬由蒋军五十二军侵占上述各地）今又重归人民之手。现沈（阳）吉（林）线吉林以南清原以北整段及四（平）梅（河口）线，除四梅线上仅残存被民主联军围困之西安孤城外，广大地区已全获解放。沈阳外围之重要战略据点抚顺及其以东之营盘，已完全暴露在林彪将军部队巨大矛头之前。
    【新华社东北前线四日电】东北民主联军一部，二日收复伊通县城。该城位于长春以南一百二十余里，守敌弃城逃窜。按：伊通系于去年五月二十一日为蒋军七十一军侵占。（附图片）
