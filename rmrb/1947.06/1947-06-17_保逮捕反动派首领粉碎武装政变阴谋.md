Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Comprehensive reports: Following the defeat of reactionary plots in Finland and Hungary by the democratic forces in the new democratic countries of Europe, Bulgaria has also successfully prevented and suppressed the attempt by domestic and foreign reactionaries to launch an armed coup. On the 7th, Sofia newspapers published on their front pages the news of the Bulgarian government's arrest of Petkov, the reactionary leader of the Agrarian Union, along with materials detailing his various criminal activities in colluding with foreign reactionaries to prepare an armed coup. Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, in response to inquiries from a reporter from the French newspaper L'Humanité, described the truth about this case as follows: Bulgarian authorities have long been monitoring Petkov's reactionary activities. He has consistently colluded with foreign reactionaries, using his position as the leader of the opposition party in the parliament to undermine Bulgaria's new democracy. Recently, there has been sufficient evidence to prove that he was preparing to launch an armed coup. The law offices immediately requested the National Assembly to revoke Petkov's parliamentary privilege and hand him over to the highest judicial authority in accordance with current laws. After the National Assembly approved this request with a majority vote, the Bulgarian government arrested Petkov and handed him over to the highest judicial body for trial, which will soon be held publicly. Dimitrov emphasized: Regarding this case, "any interference from abroad will only complicate the matter, because the suspicion will be confirmed that Petkov, in preparing the coup, not only acted in concert with his domestic accomplices but also with his foreign protectors. I can reiterate that Petkov is a Bulgarian political figure, not American, British, or French." After this case occurred, the US imperialism, which had always supported Petkov behind the scenes, openly declared through the State Department that Petkov's "talents" "had won the deep sympathy of the United States," thereby wantonly vilifying the Bulgarian government's move as "undemocratic" and making groundless accusations. American reactionary newspapers also echoed the clamor.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS, Sofia Dispatch: Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov recently met with British political representative Bannett and American political representative Honnett, and in response to their inquiries regarding the arrest of Nikola Petkov, the opposition leader who plotted the coup, stated that handing Petkov over to the judicial authorities is a matter of Bulgaria's internal affairs. Petkov, like all other Bulgarian citizens, must obey Bulgarian laws. Therefore, one should patiently and quietly await the verdict of the highest court in Bulgaria. Dimitrov further stated that, according to his instructions, Petkov has been provided with appropriate conditions in prison, and his trial will follow standard procedures without any exceptions.

　　保逮捕反动派首领粉碎武装政变阴谋
    【新华社陕北十五日电】综合报导：欧洲新民主国家民主力量在芬兰与匈牙利粉碎反动派阴谋之后，又于保加利亚胜利的防止与镇压了国内外反动派伙谋发动武装政变之企图。七日索菲亚各报均以第一版地位发表保政府逮捕农民联盟反动派首领皮特可夫的消息及其勾结国外反动派准备武装政变之种种罪恶活动的材料。保总理季米特洛夫顷于答法人道报记者之询问中，对此案之经过真象叙述如下：保加利亚最高当局早已注视皮特可夫的反动活动，他一向与国外反动派勾结，利用其国会中反对党首领人之地位从事破坏保国之新民主，近来更有足够材料证明其准备发动武装政变。律师事务所当即根据现行法律，要求国民议会解除皮特可夫议员之特权，并将其解送司法最高当局。国民议会以大多数票通过此项请求后，保政府即逮捕了皮特可夫并交与审判的最高机关，不久即将公开审判。季米特洛夫曾强调的说：关于此案，“任何来自国外的干涉，只会将问题弄得复杂化起来，因为嫌疑是会被证实的，皮特可夫在准备政变时候，他不但与其国内之同谋者联合行动，而且也与国外庇护他的人们联合行动。我可以这样反复的说，皮特可夫是保加利亚的政治人物，并不是美国的，也不是英国的或者法国的。”当此案发生后，一向在幕后支持皮特可夫的美帝国主义竟由国务院公开声明皮特可夫之“才能”，“曾博得美国之深切同情”，因而大肆污蔑保政府此举为“不民主”，妄加指责，美国反动报纸亦随着叫嚣。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社索菲亚讯：保加利亚总理季米特洛夫顷接见英政治代表班涅特及美政治代表荷尼特，答复彼等关于逮捕图谋政变的反对派首领尼可拉·皮特可夫一案之询问称：将皮特可夫交给司法当局，为保加利亚之内政问题。皮特可夫犹如其他一切保国公民一样，惟有服从保国法律。因此，一个人应当耐心而安静地等待保国的最高法院之判决。季米特洛夫进而声称：依据其训令，皮特可夫已在监狱中得到适当条件之供给，而且他的审判将没有任何例外的审判程序。
