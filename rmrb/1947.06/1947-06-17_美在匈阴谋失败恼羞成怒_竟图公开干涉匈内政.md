　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 14th: A comprehensive report: After the failure of U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to collude with reactionaries in Hungary, it became enraged and resorted to the rogue tactic of "a cornered dog jumping over the wall," groundlessly lodging an unwarranted protest to the Soviet Union. The main purpose of this protest note was to "request the swift establishment of a tripartite committee to investigate the situation there," attempting to collude with Britain to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs. Finally, the note, with its usual intimidating tactics, stated that otherwise, "the United States will consider further appropriate steps." According to U.S. officials, the so-called "appropriate steps" mean submitting the Hungarian issue to the United Nations.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 14th: Comprehensive TASS News: Pravda and Labor Daily have both published articles severely criticizing the U.S. imperialism's frenzied clamoring regarding the Hungarian political situation. A Pravda observer first pointed out: When Hitler failed, the Horthy fascist elements in Hungary colluded with the traitors of the Smallholders Party and once again obtained the assistance of "old friends." These "old friends" are the foreign reactionaries who helped Horthy destroy the Hungarian Democratic Republic (note: referring to the Soviet Republic established in Hungary after World War I) and seize power twenty-five years ago. Therefore, it is not surprising that the patrons of the conspirators clamor so loudly when their conspiracy fails. The observer criticized the retaliatory measures and clamoring of the American reactionaries, saying: From the statement of the U.S. State Department, it can be seen that the United States had not even received any information about the situation in Hungary before rushing to take certain measures, suspending credit loans to Hungary used to purchase surplus American materials. However, some people think that this unreasonable retaliation is not enough, and they even plan to use the Hungarian incident to undermine the United Nations organization. A group of senators led by Vandenberg suggested submitting the Hungarian issue to the United Nations organization. Obviously, they think that the work of the United Nations organization lies in fighting against democratic countries. Senator Isrand even declared that if the Soviet Union abandoned the United Nations organization, the United Nations could be transformed into a "military organization." The observer pointed out: Isn't this the true essence of the clamoring about the Hungarian incident? Labor Daily stated: The Hungarian people want to ask: Does the U.S. decision to refuse loans to Hungary mean that they regard Nagy as the executor of their expansionist policy in Hungary? American newspapers demand resolute measures against Hungary, but this clamoring, which attempts to interfere in Hungary's internal affairs and subvert the country's democratic regime, has not produced the effect they expected.

　　美在匈阴谋失败恼羞成怒
    竟图公开干涉匈内政
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：美帝国主义在匈牙利勾结反动派的阴谋失败之后，恼羞成怒，竟采取“狗急跳墙”的无赖办法，无端地对苏联提出无端的抗议，该项抗议照会主要目的为“请求迅速成立三强委员会，调查该地局势。”图勾结英国共同干涉匈国内政。最后该照会以其一贯的恫吓伎俩表示，否则，“美国将考虑进一步适当步骤。”据美官方表示，所谓“适当步骤”即系将匈牙利问题提交联合国。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合塔斯社讯：真理报、劳动报顷就美帝国主义对匈牙利政局所作的疯狂叫嚣一致著文予以猛烈抨击。真理报观察家首先指出：当希特勒失败时，匈牙利的霍尔第法西斯党徒就与小地主党的叛徒勾结，又一次获取“老朋友们”的援助，这些“老朋友”就是二十五年前帮助霍尔第摧毁匈牙利民主国（按：指第一次世界大战后匈牙利所成立的苏维埃共和国），夺取了政权的外国反动派。因此，当他们阴谋失败时，阴谋分子的庇护者们叫嚣得特别嚣张是不足惊奇的。观察家抨击美国反动派的报复措施和叫嚣称：从美国务院的声明可以看出，美国甚至还没有接到任何关于匈牙利情况的情报，就赶紧采取某些措施，他们中止了对匈牙利用以购买美国剩余物资的信用贷款。但是某些人以为这种无理的报复还不够，他们竟计划利用匈牙利事件来破坏联合国机构，以范登堡为首的一群参议员建议把匈牙利问题提交联合国机构。很显然，他们以为联合国机构的工作就在于和民主国作斗争。参议员依斯兰德竟至宣称，如果苏联舍弃联合国机构，联合国就能被变为“军事机构”。观察家指出：这不是对匈牙利事件的叫嚣的真正本质吗？劳动报称：匈牙利人民要问：美国拒绝对匈贷款的决议，是否意味着把奈基当成他们在匈牙利的扩张政策之执行者？美国报纸要求对匈牙利取断然措置，但这种企图干涉匈牙利内政并颠覆该国民主政权的叫嚣，并未产生他们所预期的效果。
