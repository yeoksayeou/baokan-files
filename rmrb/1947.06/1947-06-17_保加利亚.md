　　Bulgaria
    One of the new democratic countries in Southeastern Europe—Bulgaria. As a result of the National Assembly election on October 27th of last year, the Fatherland Front, led by the Bulgarian Communist Party (also known as the Workers' Party), won an overwhelming victory. The Bulgarian Communist Party secured 277 seats out of the 465 seats in the new parliament, becoming the largest party in the parliament. On November 22nd, the new government led by the leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Georgi Dimitrov, was established. In the new government, the Bulgarian Communist Party occupied nine seats, the Agrarian Party occupied five seats, and non-party members occupied two seats. From then on, Bulgaria has taken another step on the road to democracy and progress!
    Bulgaria is located in the southeast of the Balkan Peninsula, bordered by land on three sides, and the Black Sea to the east. It has an area of ​​103,500 square kilometers and a population of more than 6.89 million, of which more than 400,000 are Communist Party members, accounting for one-seventeenth of the total population.
    Before World War II, the Bulgarian fascist rulers, in order to consolidate their rule, sold Bulgaria's political and economic sovereignty to Nazi Germany and implemented a pro-German policy. As a result, the Bulgarian people lost their independence and lived like slaves. In 1941, the Bulgarian rulers, against the will of the people, rejected the conclusion of the "Soviet-Bulgarian Friendship Treaty," joined the "Axis Powers," allowed German troops to enter the country, provided Germany with the convenience of attacking Yugoslavia, and became a forward base for Germany's attack on the Soviet Union.
    The Bulgarian people have a glorious revolutionary tradition. Their struggle against the invaders has a history of more than 20 years. The heroic Red Army's repulse of the German army's offensive in 1942 further inspired their enthusiasm and belief in the anti-fascist struggle. In June, the "Fatherland Front," including the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the People's Democratic Union (also known as the Zveno Democratic Union), the National Agrarian Union, and people from all walks of life, was established. Under the call of its "Political Struggle Program," the Bulgarian army turned its guns and formed guerrilla teams to fight against the German army. On September 9th, the Red Army marched into Bulgaria. Georgiev (leader of the People's Democratic Union), the leader of the Fatherland Front, led the formation of a democratic government, made peace with the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States, and declared war on Germany. The Fatherland Front began to take control of Bulgaria's political power and unfolded the first page of Bulgaria's new history!
    Under the joint leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and democratic parties (the Bulgarian Communist Party served as Deputy Prime Minister and five ministers in the cabinet, including Finance), this democratic government implemented progressive policies, such as land reform, nationalization of large enterprises, punishment of fascist war criminals, and the establishment of friendly relations with the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and other countries.
    After the establishment of the democratic government, the reactionary forces at home and abroad in Bulgaria tried their best to engage in sabotage, but the eyes of the Bulgarian people were bright and they recognized that this was a good government. Therefore, in the general election of 1945, they unhesitatingly chose the candidates of the "Fatherland Front," crushing the Anglo-American reactionaries' conspiracy to maintain the monarchy by using the young Tsar Simeon (son of the late King Boris of Bulgaria, who turned Bulgaria into a vassal of Nazi Germany). The result of the Bulgarian citizens' referendum on September 8th last year to abolish the emperor was a victory for the republican system. On the 15th, Bulgaria officially declared itself a republic, and on October 5th, the Republic of Bulgaria announced its new constitution.
    Regarding the implementation of land reform in Bulgaria, according to the report of the chairman of the National Land Reform Committee, last year Bulgaria confiscated 538,000 hectares of land from landlords (each hectare is equal to 0.57 acres). The Bulgarian people are working hard on the work of economic reconstruction. Last year, six new rubber factories, three glass factories, and several oil refineries have been built. Unemployment has disappeared. Several universities and middle schools were also opened last year. In the recently passed two-year economic plan, one of its largest designs is to build a new workers' city on the banks of the Maritsa River, and to establish an artificial soap factory, a cement factory, and a power station that generates 50,000 kilowatts of electricity in the city. Under the wise leadership of Georgi Dimitrov, the leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the broad masses of the Bulgarian people who won the victory against fascism are continuing to move forward with vigorous steps. The growing new democratic Bulgaria will become a solid cornerstone of democracy and peace in the Balkans! (Wu Han)

　　保加利亚
    东南欧的新民主主义国家之一——保加利亚，去年十月二十七日国民大会选举的结果，以保共（又称工人党）为主导的祖国阵线获得了压倒的胜利，在新议会四百六十五席中，保共占了二百七十七席，成为议会的第一大党。十一月二十二日，由保共领袖季米特洛夫领导组成的新政府成立，在新政府中保共占九席，农民党占五席，无党派占两席。从此，保加利亚在民主与进步的道路上又迈进了一步！
    保加利亚位于巴尔干半岛东南，三面接陆，东濒黑海，面积十万三千五百方里，人口有六百八十九万多，其中有四十多万为共产党员，占全人口的十七分之一。
    二次世界大战以前，保国法西斯统治者们为巩固自己统治地位，将保国政治经济主权出卖给纳粹德国，实行亲德政策。因此保国人民失去了独立，过着奴仆般的生活。一九四一年，保国统治者更违反民意，拒绝了“苏保友好条约”的缔结，参加“轴心三国公约”，让德军开入国境，给德国以攻击南斯拉夫的便利，并成为德国进攻苏联的前哨堡垒。
    保国人民是具有光荣的革命传统的，他们与侵略者的斗争，有了二十多年的历史，由于一九四二年英勇的红军击退德军的进攻，更鼓舞了他们反法西斯斗争的热情与信念。六月，包括共产党、社会民主党、人民民主联盟（又称兹维诺民主联盟）、全国农民联盟及各阶层人民的“祖国阵线”便成立了。在其“政治斗争纲领”的号召下，保军调转枪口，组成游击队，同德军作战。九月九日，红军进兵保境，祖国阵线领袖乔吉尔夫（人民民主联盟领袖）就领导组成民主政府，与苏英美讲和，对德宣战，祖国阵线开始掌握了保国政权，展开了保国新历史的第一页！
    这一民主政府在保共与民主党派共同领导下（保共当了副总理及内阁中财政等五个部长）实行进步的政策，如土地改革，大企业国有化，惩办法西斯战犯，与苏南捷等国建立了友好关系。
    民主政府成立后，保国内外反动派想尽方法从事破坏，但保国人民的眼睛是亮的，认清了这是一个好政府，因此一九四五年的大选中，他们毫不犹豫的选择了“祖国阵线”的候选人，粉碎了英美反动派利用幼皇薛米洪（将保国变为纳粹德国附庸的已故保王鲍利斯之子）保持帝制的阴谋。去年九月八日的保国公民复决废除皇帝的结果，共和制获得了胜利，十五日保国正式宣布为共和国，十月五日保加利亚共和国宣布了新宪法。
    保国土地改革的实行，据全国土地改革委员会主席的报告，去年保国已没收了地主土地五十三万八千荷德（每荷德合零点五七公亩）。对于经济建设的复兴工作，保国人民正在努力进行中，去年已建立了六个新橡胶厂，三个玻璃厂及几个炼油厂，失业已经绝迹，去年并开办了几所大中学校，在最近通过的两年经济计划，其最大设计之一，是在马利萨河畔建设一座新工人城，并在该城设立人造肥皂厂，水泥厂及发五万千瓦时电量的电力站。在保共领袖季米特洛夫的英明领导下，赢得了反法西斯胜利的保国广大人民，正以矫健的步伐继续前进着，日益生长壮大的新民主主义的保加利亚，将成为巴尔干之民主与和平的一块坚固的基石！（吴函）
