Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 4th -- As the battle had just ended, this reporter followed the army into Huachi County, which had just been recovered. This is a small piece of flat land surrounded by mountains, with a stream flowing slowly through the narrow valley. Newly opened cave dwellings and newly built houses are arranged in a complex pattern. Some projects are not yet completed, indicating that this is a new city. Now the streets and ground are full of tall, stout Mongolian horses, mostly chestnut-colored, all with saddles, obediently following the People's Liberation Army soldiers to the assembly point. Some impatient people are already speeding around the suburbs trying them out. On several avenues, crowds are mingling, and victorious People's Liberation Army soldiers, carrying captured guns and cannons, and leading captured horses, are going in teams to camp in the surrounding villages outside the city. At the same time, many residents who had fled are returning to their broken homes in groups, helping the old and the young, carrying loads on their shoulders and in their hands. They take out steamed buns from their baskets and eggs from their arms and stuff them into the soldiers' hands, saying, "You must be hungry, you've worked hard." This time, when Huachi was recovered, there was no fighting in the city, only some contact on the mountains. When two soldiers of the People's Liberation Army captured the left side of the enemy's main position at dawn on the 30th, more than 20 Chiang-Hu soldiers knelt down and laid down their guns. Then hundreds of brave soldiers rushed to the center of the Chiang army's position, and the Chiang army's solid fortifications, which had been painstakingly built for more than a month, collapsed. Lijiagou Mao outside the city was the last stronghold of the Chiang army. When the shells landed continuously and accurately, the enemy shrunk their heads and raised their guns.

　　重获解放后的华池
    【新华社陕北前线四日电】战事刚结束，记者随军进入新收复的华池县城。这是一块群山环抱中的小平地，在狭谷中缓缓的流着溪水。新开的窑洞和新建的房屋错综陈列着，有些工程尚未完竣，说明这是一座新的城市。现在满街满地挤着高大肥壮的蒙古马，多红栗色，一律皮鞍，顺从地跟随人民解放军战士到集合地。有些性急的人已在郊外飞驰着试骑了。几条大道上交流着人群，胜利的人民解放军扛着缴获的枪炮，牵着缴获的马一队队的到城外四周村庄中去宿营。同时许多逃亡在外的居民，扶老携幼，肩挑手提，一群群的回到自己破碎的家。他们从篮里拿出馒头，从怀里掏出鸡蛋塞到战士手里说：“你们饿了，你们辛苦了。”这次收复华池，城内未经作战，只是在山头上有过接触。当三十日黎明人民解放军两个战士攻下敌主要阵地左侧时，廿多名蒋胡军就跪着放下枪来。接着数百名神勇战士冲上了蒋军阵地中心点，于是蒋军苦心经营一月多的强固工事就告崩溃了。城外李家沟峁是蒋军最后的一个据点，当炮弹连续准确地落进去时，敌人就缩起头举起枪来。
