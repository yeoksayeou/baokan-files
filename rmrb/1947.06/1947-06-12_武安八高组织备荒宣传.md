　　Wu'an Eighth High School Organizes Famine Prevention Propaganda
    [This newspaper's Wu'an dispatch] The teachers and students of the First Assault Production Team of the Eighth High School in Wu'an have composed a "Drought Prevention and Famine Preparation Clapper Talk" to promote it to the masses everywhere. Bai Guan students Wei Dongkao, Wei Xishun, and Wei Jinxiang created a "Canteen Blackboard News," writing on it in their own words: "Plan for a steady stream of water, be frugal to prevent famine and get through lean years." The masses crowded around to read it. Students Zhao Jiaying, Song Youhui, and others are using oral propaganda in the canteen to promote it to the masses. It is now influencing some of the masses to mix chaff into their rice to prevent disasters and famines. (Zhang Jingguo, Li Qin)
