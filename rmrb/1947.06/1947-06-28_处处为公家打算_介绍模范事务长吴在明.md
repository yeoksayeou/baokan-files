　　Always Thinking of the Public Interest
    Introducing Model Logistics Chief Wu Zaiming
    [This newspaper, Wu'an News] Wu Zaiming, the logistics chief of Wu'an County, is good at planning and saving, and is recognized as a model. He recently received a special merit award for his work.
    In 1946, Comrade Zaiming was ordered to lead four cooks to Shayu to be responsible for the livelihood of more than 1,400 new soldiers. Usually, one cook would be responsible for the meals of at most 30 to 40 people. This time, each person had to supply 300 people, but he did not retreat. He used more than 160 loads of water every day. He planned and arranged the manpower, and set up four large pots to boil water to ensure that meals were not delayed and that there was always boiled water to drink. He had to cut vegetables until midnight every day, and the kitchen was filled with smoke as soon as it dawned. He never complained or wanted to change jobs. On the contrary, he took the lead himself and played a leading role. Since the higher authorities put forward the slogan of production and savings, he has planned to lead the cooks to earnestly plan and implement this slogan. He once sprouted 1,500 catties of bean sprouts, which cost 40 yuan per catty on the market. Sprouting the bean sprouts himself only cost 20 yuan, saving 30,000 yuan. He raised a sow, which has given birth to two litters of 18 piglets in total. In order to streamline personnel, he first reduced the number of people in the kitchen from five to three, with one person doing the work of two. One of them often participated in agricultural production. From January to May, he saved 25,500 catties of coal by burning good coal thoroughly and diligently checking the fire. In terms of food, he used accurate registration of the number of people, distributed rice according to the number of people, and seized the opportunity to obtain guest meals, accumulating 5,000 catties of millet. He also used his spare time to pick up 200 catties of coal cinder. Such planned, bit-by-bit production and savings eventually amounted to a huge sum of 600,000 yuan. In terms of personal savings, his actions are also exemplary. He does not receive anything issued by the public throughout the year. The original plan was to hand in 6,000 yuan for production, but he has now handed in 8,000 yuan and 1,000 catties of millet, exceeding the original task.
