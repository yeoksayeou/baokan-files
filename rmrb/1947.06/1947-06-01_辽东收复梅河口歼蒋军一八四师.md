　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, urgent dispatch on the 29th: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated an entire division, the 184th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's 60th Army, last night (the 28th), and recovered Meihekou, a strategic point northeast of Shenyang. Hei Shizhen, an important town southwest of Huadian, was also recovered by another unit of the Democratic Allied Army on the same day. The Meihekou encirclement battle began on the 25th of this month. The Chiang Kai-shek troops defending the city relied on solid fortifications and Chiang's aircraft support, putting up a stubborn resistance. The battle lasted four days and nights, and was finally resolved at 8 pm last night. All the defending enemies were annihilated, and the number of prisoners being seized is currently being verified.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, dispatch on the 30th: The recovery of Meihekou is an important victory in the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's summer offensive, marking a change in the situation in southeastern Manchuria. The area is the intersection of three railways: Shenyang-Jilin, Siping-Meihekou, and Meihekou-Jian. Commerce is developed. The puppet Manchukuo planned to establish "Zhongjing" here. After Chiang's army occupied the area on May 24 last year, they vigorously built strong fortresses and moved the headquarters of the New Sixth Army here, making it a major supply base for repeated invasions of the Liaodong liberated area. The 184th Division stationed in the area originally belonged to the Yunnan Army's 60th Army. On this day last year, under the leadership of its former commander, General Pan Shuoduan, the division staged an anti-civil war uprising in Haicheng. Du Yuming immediately collected the remnants and transferred officers and soldiers from the New Sixth Army's 22nd Division and other units from his direct line troops to supplement the division, in order to strengthen his control over it and drive it back into the civil war battlefield. However, during the fourth invasion of the Liaodong liberated area this spring, part of it was first annihilated by our army. Until the summer offensive began, about two more battalions were annihilated at Beishanchengzi and Caoshi on the Jilin-Shenyang line. The division headquarters then led two regiments to shrink and defend Meihekou, and now the entire army has been wiped out.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, dispatch on the 30th: On the Siping front, a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army launched a sabotage war south of Siping on the evening of the 23rd, destroying more than ten li of railway north of Mengniushao (forty li southwest of Siping). More than thirty Chiang Kai-shek troops, including a deputy battalion commander, were killed or wounded, and more than thirty officers, including a lieutenant colonel, were captured.

　　辽东收复梅河口歼蒋军一八四师
    【新华社东北前线二十九日急电】东北民主联军某部，昨（二十八日）晚歼灭蒋军六十军一八四师一个整师，收复沈阳东北战略要地梅河口。桦甸西南重镇黑石镇，亦于同日为民主联军另部收复。梅河口围歼战始于本月二十五日，守城蒋军一八四师曾凭恃坚固堡垒及蒋机助战，负隅顽抗，战斗达四昼夜，最后于昨晚八时解决战斗，守敌全部被歼，俘获正清查中。
    【新华社东北前线三十日电】梅河口之收复，为东北民主联军夏季攻势中重要的胜利，标志东南满形势将因之改观。该地为沈（阳）吉（林）、四（平）梅（河口）、梅（河口）辑（安）三条铁路之交叉点，商业发达。伪满时拟设“中京”于此。蒋军去年五月二十四日侵占该地后，即大力修筑强固要塞，将新六军军部移置于此，为历次进犯辽东解放区之一大兵站基地。驻守该地之一八四师，原属滇军六十军。去年今日，该师在前师长潘朔端将军领导下，于海城举行反内战起义。杜聿明旋即收罗其残部，在嫡系主力中，抽调新六军二十二师等部官兵补充该师，以加强对其控制，重驱其步入内战战场。然于今春第四次进犯辽东解放区之役，首被我军歼灭一部。迄夏季攻势展开，在吉（林）沈（阳）线上之北山城子与草市，再被歼约两个营后，该师师部即率两个团缩守梅河口，现则全军覆灭。
    【新华社东北前线三十日电】四平方面，东北民主联军一部，二十三日晚于四平以南展开破袭战，破坏虻牛哨（四平西南四十里）以北铁路十余里。毙伤蒋军副营长以下三十余名，俘中校军官以下三十余人。
