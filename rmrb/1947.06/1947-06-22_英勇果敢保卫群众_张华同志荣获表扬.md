　　Heroic and Valiant in Defending the Masses
    Comrade Zhang Hua Receives Commendation
    [This Newspaper] Comrade Zhang Hua, Director of the Jiaozuo City Public Security Bureau, bravely and resolutely defended the masses and leading organs, and the Taihang Fourth Administrative Office issued a special order of commendation. It stated: "On April 23rd, two hundred enemy die-hards surrounded ×× Village – the Municipal Government Headquarters. The situation was critical. The Public Security Bureau's station was ten li away from ××. Director Zhang heard the gunfire and immediately led the public security team to rescue them. They opened fire on the enemy's approach routes, Longdong and Matigou, causing the enemy to flee in panic. The personnel of the Municipal Government and the local masses were safely transferred. A wounded guard, who had been discovered by the enemy and was about to be killed, was also rescued as a result. On May 29th, the enemy went to Xizhang Village to seize wheat. Director Zhang immediately took four or five people with a machine gun, and together with Comrade Zhao Lianbi, director of the Workers' Militia Team, and several team members, went to the high ground at the edge of the village to cover the safe evacuation of the villagers. When they turned to the Da'ao Ridge behind Xizhang Village, they saw that the enemy had already burned the wheat in Da'ao. The Public Security Team leader said, 'The enemy has reached behind Da'ao to outflank us.' Comrade Zhang Hua resolutely said, 'We will die here,' and did not allow them to retreat, but instead advanced forward, ordering some people to occupy a hilltop in front and shoot towards the side of the village, preventing the enemy from entering the village."
    Director Zhang's heroic and valiant, taking the lead, in defending the leading organs and protecting the lives and property of the masses, should be commended by order.
