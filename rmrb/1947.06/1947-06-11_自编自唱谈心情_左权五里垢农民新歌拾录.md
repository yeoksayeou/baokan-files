Singing Self-Composed Songs to Express Feelings
A Collection of New Songs from Farmers in Wuli Gou, Zuoquan

During the Lantern Festival entertainment activities this year, the liberated farmers of Wuli Gou fully demonstrated their creative talents. In the square dramas, they composed and sang many new songs. Here are some excerpts:

Bai Laiyin, sixty-four years old, was originally extremely poor. Before the war, he worked as a cook. Before liberation, he begged for food in the enemy-occupied areas. He shouted to everyone, "It's really unbearable, I used to cook for the rich. When the Japanese occupied Liaoxian City, I served them every day. I followed the Wen family (a major landlord in Zuoquan) to flee. The children ate fine noodles, and I ate bran. The landlord Yinglin (Wen) beat me, and his second wife spat at my simple food. Thinking about cooking for them is really hard, I was tormented to death by the landlord. Later, the landlord drove me out, and I went to Hama Beach to beg for food. I saw their family (landlord) was cooking, and they gave me some sweet potatoes. I felt a little impatient, came back and stumbled into the river! I warmed myself on the sunny slope, my face was frozen black and blue. I was still hungry when I got back, so I ran west to Dongchangyi." Speaking of his life after liberation, he excitedly told everyone, "I didn't have a cotton-padded coat for five winters. After liberation, I got a big cloth coat, a piece of old cloth, and a large roll of scrap cloth. I got land and houses, and also 5,000 yuan in silver. I also got a shovel and a @, a pot on the stove, a large pot and hoe, and a small hoe to use. I'm sixty-four years old, and I've never seen anything like this before. The Communist Party's leadership is really good, I will never forget it."

Liu Yunxiang's wife, Qichunhua, complained, "The rich are really terrible, I even breastfed their child. I suffered from digging up feces and urine, and only got a pair of copper earrings after work."

Li Xiucheng complained, "I used to farm your land with the oxen, and dug coal and mud. I suffered for three whole years, and it was only enough to pay off the interest."

Xi Zhengfu complained, "The '28 deduction' was really terrible, forcing us to have no choice. We didn't dare to sleep at home in December, and secretly hid in a big cupboard. My wife delivered food in secret, and I couldn't even come out to pee or shit. The sound of a paper cannon went off, and that's how we got through it."

Geng Xiuzhen (a woman) complained about the old society, "Thinking about the past is really sad, my feet were bound from childhood. I struggled all day long, and ended up with 'golden lotuses'."

Bai Linxiang (a sixty-nine-year-old poor peasant) pointed to the clothes he was wearing and said gratefully, "I thought I would die without clothes, but I got a big padded jacket." He also said, "I'm sixty-nine years old this year, and I've never experienced this kind of world before. I got a bed and a quilt, and a tobacco pipe."

Liu Yulin (a sixty-seven-year-old middle peasant) felt grateful for the birthday wishes he received from the masses in the new society, "This year I'm sixty-seven, and people from the whole village came to celebrate my birthday, bringing tea and wine, I couldn't stop smiling."

Old man Bai Laiyin said, "They came to celebrate my birthday on the fifteenth day of the first month. They brought a pomegranate, thinking it was a needle gourd, but it turned out to be a big birthday peach."

Young woman Zhang Aiying (a military dependent) said, "Men and women are equal, we have food, clothing, and land to cultivate. If my man joins the army, I will take care of the elderly at home."

Young man Ma Yumei expressed his gratitude to the new society, "I used to be a hired laborer, but now I'm liberated. I have a house and land to cultivate, and I can marry freely."

During a martial arts performance, a militia blasting expert said, "The blasting team is even more commendable. We strive to have two or three models. Wang Genhe and Liang Zuocai can lay mines in less than five minutes."

　　自编自唱谈心情
    左权五里垢农民新歌拾录
    今年元宵文娱活动中，五里垢翻身农民充分表现了创作的天才。在广场剧中，他们自编自唱出许多新歌兹摘录一些在下面：
    白来银六十四岁，原来是个赤贫，战前住过盘（做饭），未解放前在敌占区要饭，他撕开喉咙告大家说：“说个没法真没法，俺给财主住过盘，日本占了辽县城，俺是每天伺侯人。跟上温家（左权大地主）往外逃，伢吃细面俺吃糠。地主应麟（温）打过俺，他二老婆唾俺家常饭。提起住盘真难过，活叫地主熬煞我。后来财主撵出俺，蛤蟆滩里去要饭。见伢自家（地主）正做饭，给了俺些山药蛋。心里有些不耐烦，回来闪到河里边！阳坡圪落暖一暖，脸上冻成黑青蛋。回来还是饿肚皮，向西跑到东长义。”说到翻身后的光景，他激昂地告大家说：“五年过冬没袄穿，翻身给了个大布衫，配哩是件旧布衫，还有碎布一大卷，土地房屋都分全，又分大洋五千元，又分锹来又分＠，还有火上一吊锅，大锅锄板各一件，小锄一个能使换。老人活了六十四，没啦见过这一次。共产党领导真是好，甚时俺也忘不了。”
    刘云祥老婆岂春花控诉说：“财主真厉害，俺还给他奶过孩。挖屎弄尿受过罪，下工只给了一付铜耳坠。”
    李秀成诉苦说：“从前给你把牛地，又掏煤炭又挖泥。一共受了整三年，结果刚够顶伢利。”
    席正福控诉说：“二八除扣真利害，迫的俺们无其奈。腊月不敢在家睡，偷偷藏进大铺柜。老婆送饭不公开，屙屎弄尿不出来。乒乓一声纸炮响，这才算是熬过来。”
    耿秀珍（妇女）控诉旧社会说：“提起过去真难受，从小把俺脚裹住。黑明白日紧哩斗，结果放成个金黄后。”
    白林祥（六十九岁贫农）指着身上衣服感激地说：“则说死了没衣裳，果实还给了个大夹袄。”又说：“老汉今年六十九，没啦经过这世道。又分铺又分盖，又给了一个旱烟袋。”
    刘玉林（中农六十七岁）对新社会群众给他祝寿有感：“今年老汉六十七，全村人们来祝寿，又端茶来又端酒，笑哩嘴也摸不住。”
    白来银老人说：“正月十五来祝寿。脯上带的一不榴，只说是个针葫芦，不想是个大寿桃。”
    青年妇女张爱英（军属）说：“男人女人讲平等，有吃有穿有地种，男人参了军，家中爷娘我照应。”
    男青年马玉梅对新社会感激说：“从前住长工，现在翻了身，有房有地种，自由结下婚。”
    表演练武中，民兵爆炸能手说：“爆炸队更可夸，争取模范有两三人，王更和梁作材埋雷不用五分钟。”
