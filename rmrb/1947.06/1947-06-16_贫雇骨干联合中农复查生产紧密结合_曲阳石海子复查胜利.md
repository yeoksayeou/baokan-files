Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 11th: In Shishaizi Village, Quyang, Ji-Jin District, poor peasants as the backbone united with middle peasants and victoriously re-examined and settled accounts with landlords and local tyrants, including Shi Luoqi and five other families. They obtained more than 180 mu of land, 120 rooms, and a large amount of grain, clothing, cash, livestock, and farm implements, etc. The production difficulties of the poor peasants were resolved. The re-examination in this village had three characteristics: (1) The mass mobilization was extensive and in-depth. With the poor peasant groups as the backbone, they united the middle peasants. All 500 poor and middle peasants in the village participated in the struggle, all of them being active and determined. During the speaking bitterness meetings, the masses shed tears of grief and indignation. During the struggle, they paraded the landlords on the streets, shouting, "We have turned over!" (2) The leadership let go and followed the mass line, which was manifested in the fact that the peasants changed their minds and dared to speak and fight. Everything was discussed and deliberated in large and small meetings before being carried out. For example, the handling of a struggle target was debated many times. Finally, all members reached a consensus before passing it, overcoming the blindness of the masses. Therefore, no farmers' complaints were heard, leaving no room for the landlords to counterattack. When the re-examination committee was elected, all seven elected members were poor peasants. The director, Shi Luoying, was a loyal, reliable, and actively struggling poor person. (3) The re-examination was closely integrated with production. In addition to a large forum for speaking bitterness and a struggle meeting, the liquidation was carried out during lunch breaks and at night. The undivided land was cultivated by people specially assigned by the re-examination committee. The seeds, fertilizers, and wages were solved by the fruits of victory, so that the land was not wasted.

　　贫雇骨干联合中农复查生产紧密结合
    曲阳石海子复查胜利
    【新华社晋察冀十一日电】冀晋区曲阳石海子村，以贫农为骨干团结中农，向地主恶霸石洛其等六家复查清算胜利。获得土地一百八十余亩，房百二十间，及粮食、衣物、现款、牲口、农具等甚多。贫农生产困难得以解决。该村复查有三个特点：（一）群众发动广泛深入。以贫农小组为骨干联合了中农，全村贫中农五百人悉数参加了斗争，个个积极坚决。诉苦中群众悲愤流涕、斗争时他们押着地主在街上大游行，高喊：“我们可翻了身啦”。（二）领导上放开手，走群众路线，表现在农民翻了心，敢说敢斗。凡事都是经过大小会讨论酝酿后才去作。如一个斗争对象的处理，曾经多次争论。最后全体会员认识一致才通过，克服了群众的盲目性，因此听不到任何农民不满的话，使地主无反攻的空隙可乘。在选复查委员会时，当选的七个委员均为贫农。主任石洛应是一个忠实可靠积极斗争的贫苦人。（三）复查与生产紧密结合。除一个大座谈会诉苦及斗争会以外，均利用歇晌夜间进行清算。未分之地由复查委员会推专人种起来、其种子、肥料，工资由胜利果实解决，使地不荒。
