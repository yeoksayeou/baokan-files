　　At Zhong'er Temple Aiding
    Ke Gang
    Fifteen li east of Anyang city, there is a village called Zhong'er Temple Aiding. I arrived here on the second Sunday after the People's Liberation Army had eliminated the Jiang-puppet Wang Ziquan bandit gang. The village is next to the railway and has about a hundred households, shaded by willows. Now, a field hospital of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army is stationed here. The nurses have swept the streets very clean.
    All the houses in the village are very dilapidated, except for the two most beautiful courtyards, one at the east end, belonging to Li Fuxiang, the Kuomintang township head, and the other at the west end, belonging to Wang Guobin, Wang Ziquan's relative by marriage. But now they have both fled to Anyang city. Farmer Wang Xilai led me to visit these two fine courtyards. Indeed, both families were very wealthy. The painted beams and carved pillars, even the pillars in the stables, were painted red. And each family had a garden. Many rooms were filled with the smell of makeup. The clothes and furniture were intact. Just then, I found two pawn agreements in Wang Guobin's courtyard. One was from Huang Qingtian, who pawned his 3.8 mu of land to Wang Guobin for three years for 1,000 yuan. The other was from Song Futang, who pawned his 4 mu of land to Wang Guobin for three years for 40 yuan. Wang Xilai happily grabbed my hand and asked:
    "These two papers aren't mine, are they?"
    I said, "No."
    He quickly continued, "These were dropped by people when they left. They took away a box of this stuff, a big red box, containing the land and lives of so many people! And I have several of them too. There are very few poor people in our village who don't have IOUs in his hands. Comrade, when can we get that box back?"
    "Soon, that day will come," I said.
    In Wang Guobin's main room, there was a demonic-looking photograph of an old man with a white beard, surrounded by twenty or thirty young women and wives under the age of twenty-five, all wearing colorful silks and dressed very seductively. The old man had a greedy smile. I asked who this person was. Wang Xilai said:
    "It's Wang Ziquan's father. This was taken last year during his birthday celebration. Wang Ziquan inquired everywhere to see whose daughters and wives had good features, and sent people to forcibly bring them to accompany him for the photo." As he spoke, he angrily smashed the photograph with a wooden stick.

　　在冢儿寺艾丁
    柯岗
    在安阳城东十五里，有个村子叫冢儿寺艾叮人民解放军在这里肃清了蒋伪王自全匪帮之后的第二个星期日，我到了这里。这村靠着火车路，住有百十户人家，杨柳成荫。现在这里驻着人民解放军某部野战医务所。护士们把街上打扫的非常干净。
    村里所有屋宇都很破旧，只有两座院子最漂亮，一座在东头，主人是国民党乡长李富乡；一座在西头，主人是王自全的亲家王国滨，可是现在他们都已逃到安阳城里去了。农民王希来领我参观了这两座好院子，确实两家都很阔气，画栋雕梁连马厩里的柱子都是漆得红油油的。并且每家都有花园，许多房里充满着染人的化装品的气息，衣服家具完整无缺。正在这时我在王国滨的院里发现两张典契，一张是黄青天以一千元把自己三亩八分地典给了王国滨三年。另一张是宋甫堂以四十元把自己四亩地典给了王国滨三年。王希来很高兴的拉住我的手问：
    “这两张字不是我的吧？”
    我说：“不是。”
    他急忙接着说：“这是人家临走时掉了的呀，人家带走了一箱子这东西，多大一个红箱子呀，多少人的地，多少人的命，都在那箱里装着哩！还有我好几张呢。俺村的穷人们在他手里没有字据的很少，同志咱啥时候才能把那个箱子夺回来呢？”
    “快啦，总有这一天。”我说。
    在王国滨的堂屋里，挂着一张妖魔一样的照片，一个白胡子老汉，被二、三十个二十五岁以下少女和少妇族拥着，都披着彩绸，打扮的十分妖艳。那老汉则带着贪欲的微笑。我问这是什么人，王希来说：
    “是王自全的父亲。这是去年给他庆寿时，王自全四处打听，看谁家的闺女媳妇眉眼好，派人硬拉来陪他照的。”他一面说，一面就愤恨的用木棍打碎了这照片。
