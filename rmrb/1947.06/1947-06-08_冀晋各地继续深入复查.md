Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jinchaji) 30th Dispatch: The review movement in various parts of Hebei and Shanxi continues to unfold in depth. Lingshou convened a cadre meeting on the 3rd of this month to deploy the review work. The county party committee put forward action slogans at the meeting such as "move the organs to the countryside," "turn fake orderlies into real orderlies," and "give the power to 90% of the farmers." Yingxian proposed two points for correcting major deviations in its deployment: (1) lack of comprehensive leadership and insufficient control over land reform, and (2) the serious existence of a rush for quick success, paternalism, and the view of bestowing favors in land reform in marginal areas. The fire of review in Fuping is burning higher and higher. In the first district, 22 villages, and more than 2,000 farmers organized "overturning teams." The notorious local tyrants and landlords Zhao and Yuan were overthrown, and their land, floating wealth, and hidden possessions were all liquidated and compensated to the farmers, and are now being discussed for distribution. In Anshan, Eighth District of Hunyuan, the local bullies Li Yonghai and Tao Liang previously evaded the struggle by falsely "donating land," and afterwards constantly enticed and threatened the farmers. This review ignited the flames of struggle in the village, exposing more than 400 mu of land and about 7 million yuan worth of property. The farmers of Wuliu Dongye recently overthrew the notorious "Mother Tiger." In Kun's Village, Pingding, 162 mu of land were recovered during the review, thoroughly resolving the difficulties of military personnel, cadres, families of martyrs, and poor farmers.

　　冀晋各地继续深入复查
    【新华社晋察冀三十日电】冀晋各地复查运动继续深入展开。灵寿在本月三日召开干部大会，布置复查工作，县委在会上提出“把机关拨到农村中去”、“假勤务员变成真勤务员”、“大权交给百分之九十的农民”等行动口号。应县在布置中提出纠正大偏向两点：（一）对土地改革领导不全面与掌握不够，（二）边缘区土地改革中急于求功包办、代替恩赐观点的严重存在。阜平复查烈火越烧越高，一区二十二个村二千余农民组织了“翻身大队”。斗倒了阜平有名的恶霸、地主赵、袁两大家，将其土地、浮财、内藏一齐清算赔偿农民，现正进行讨论分配。浑源八区鞍山恶霸栗永海、陶良土前以假“献地”逃避了斗争，事后并不断的引诱、威胁农民，此次复查中该村掀起斗争烈火，斗出了四百余亩土地，与约值七百万元的财物。五六东冶农民最近斗倒了有名的“母老虎”。平定昆家庄复查出土地一百六十二亩，彻底解决了军、干、烈属及贫农的困难。
