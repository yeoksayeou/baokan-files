　　Handan City Cultural and Educational Circles
    Voice Support for Student Movement in Chiang Area
    [Reported by this newspaper] The "May 20th" Massacre in Beijing and Tianjin aroused grief and indignation among all teachers and students of Handan High School, who are willing to support the student movement in the Chiang area with practical actions. A forum of cultural circles was held at the Handan Theater at 3:00 PM on May 30th, mainly with students from Handan High School. Representatives from various agencies and schools in the city and cultural workers attended, totaling more than 200 people. Mayor Wang also attended in person. At the beginning of the meeting, student representative Jia Xueqian reported the significance of the meeting, stating: Students in the Chiang-controlled area are petitioning and demonstrating to Chiang Kai-shek for food and peace, regardless of sacrifice. In order to persist in fighting the civil war, the Chiang bandit used armed suppression and killing against the student movement, resulting in the "May 20th" Massacre. The students in the Chiang-controlled area are our brotherly front. Their victory is our victory, and their failure is our loss. Today we should support them and join hands with them to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible and strive for peace. Thirteen-year-old student Ren Futan said: "Chiang Kai-shek wants dictatorship, doesn't let students eat, and even kills people. We have to support them. How can we support them? That is, produce more and learn more." Many students and Mayor Wang, among others, spoke. Finally, a telegram to the whole country was approved. (Handan City Correspondence Group)

　　邯郸市文化教育界
    声援蒋区学生运动
    【本报讯】京津“五二○”惨案发生后，激起邯中全体师生的悲痛愤恨，愿意以实际行动声援蒋区学运。特于五月三十日下午三时，以邯中同学为主在邯郸剧院召开文化界座谈会。到会者有全市各机关学校代表及文化工作者，共二百余人，王市长也亲自参加。开会时首由学生代表贾学谦报告开会意义，略谓：蒋管区的学生为了吃饭为了和平，不怕牺牲向蒋介石请愿游行示威。蒋贼为了坚持打内战，对学生运动以武装镇压捕杀，造成“五二○”大惨案。蒋管区同学是我们的兄弟阵线，他们的胜利就是我们的胜利，他们的失败就是我们的损。今天我们应该声援他们，和他们共同携起手来，早日把蒋介石打垮，争取和平。十三岁小同学任福坛说：“蒋介石要独裁不叫学生吃饭，还要杀人家，我们得声援，怎样声援呢？就是多生产多学习。”许多同学和王市长等讲了话，最后通过了向全国发的电文。（邯市通讯小组）
