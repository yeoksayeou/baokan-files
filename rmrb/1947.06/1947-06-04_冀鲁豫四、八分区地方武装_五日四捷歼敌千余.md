　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Fourth and Eighth Sub-districts Local Armed Forces
    Achieve Four Victories in Five Days, Eliminating Over a Thousand Enemies

    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 1st] (Delayed Arrival) The Fourth and Eighth Sub-districts Command has just released a battle report for the five days from April 26th to 30th. Our local armed forces, with four victories in five days of battle (namely, the strong attack on Fengqiu City, the annihilation battle at Lao Ya Zhang Village, the pursuit battle at San Guan Miao, and the battle at Jia Di), coordinated with our regular army's great victory at Tangyin. Within five days, the puppet bandits Wang Sanzhu, Ding Shuben, and their units were severely attacked by us. We achieved brilliant results, including the recovery of three county towns: Fengqiu, Yangwu, and Yanjin. We captured over 300 enemies, including Lu Lanling, the Deputy Commander of the Puyang Police Corps, and Li Danshun, the head of the Fengqiu Self-Defense Brigade. Over 750 enemies were killed in battle or drowned while fleeing to the Yellow River, and over 800 were scattered. We seized 6 light machine guns, 3 grenade launchers, over 600 rifles, 14 pistols, 34 mules and horses, harvested over 10,000 catties of electric wire, and broke through over 10 encircled villages.

    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 1st] The Fourth Sub-district Military Commission convened a joint meeting of county military commission directors on May 4th to summarize the achievements of the militia in participating in the self-defense war over the past eight months and to determine future struggle strategies. From September of last year to the end of April this year, in Gaoling and Hua County alone, the entire sub-district fought 524 battles, capturing 171 enemies. A total of 1,179 rifles, 6 light machine guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 4 Mauser pistols, 5 grenade launchers, 110 shells, 6,100 rounds of ammunition, 1,325 hand grenades, 4,000 catties of rice, 3,000 catties of wheat, 4,000 catties of miscellaneous grains, 5 war horses and mules, and many other military supplies were seized. In the eight months of struggle, the ideology of the cadres has been raised a step further, and the number of militia has also greatly increased. In the past, due to the peaceful illusions of a few cadres and the mechanical execution of the district's "not leaving the district" instructions, the militia were excessively dispersed, resulting in some losses. However, in the recent land reform, it has been initially restored and developed. In Kunwu alone, there are 1,100 male militia members and 1,200 female militia members, accounting for 5% of the total population. In the future, we will vigorously develop tunnel construction and landmine warfare. To effectively carry out this movement, the sub-district military commission decided to train explosive experts and strengthen the command at all levels, making them truly the core of guerrilla warfare.

    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 1st] The local armed forces of the Sixth and Seventh Sub-districts actively fought in April, achieving significant results: The Seventh Sub-district fought 15 battles of various sizes, recovering the cities of Dongping and Wenshang. It captured over 240 enemies, killed and wounded over 90, and seized over 300 long and short guns, 1 light machine gun, 6 grenade launchers, and 3 vehicles. The Sixth Sub-district fought 10 battles of various sizes, capturing 55 enemies, killing and wounding 78, and seizing 67 rifles, 4 light machine guns, 3 short guns, 5,896 rounds of ammunition, and 44 bombs.

    [Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 1st] Our Linze Guerrilla Brigade, persisting in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, resolutely supported the masses, suppressed bad elements, launched a counter-"grain seizure" campaign, and maintained the rural front, enabling guerrilla warfare to take root among the masses. In the three months of fighting from January 20th to April 20th, it achieved brilliant victories, eliminating 150 enemies (including 8 regular Chiang soldiers), including Zhang Naiji, the intelligence director with the rank of major, and seized 14 vehicles (8 destroyed), 34 long and short guns, 1 submachine gun, over 800 rounds of various ammunition, 54 boxes of shells, 108 bags of rice, and many other war spoils. In this battle, we suffered only one minor injury.
