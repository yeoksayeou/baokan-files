After Xuehua left, Xiao Yu moved closer to Genzheng and waited a long time before saying, "You are the director of the Military Affairs Committee, I want to ask you: this time joining the army, he - Mao Hai's father, can he not go?"

The Gao brothers were in a hurry to go to a meeting, so without asking for details, Genzheng answered her like this: "Zhao Migui volunteered. For those of you who have been liberated and turned into farmers, do you want to protect the fruits of your struggle? You decide for yourselves!"

"It's not that I want to drag my feet. You see, my family doesn't have much labor, and I also work in the Women's Federation, and I'm also dragging Mao Hai along, so I don't have time for production!" Xiao Yu said, but she looked somewhat ashamed.

Old Man Gao coughed angrily, stood up, and pointed at his two sons with his dry tobacco pipe: "Today - we are digging up the landlord's old roots! My eldest and second sons are both called to go, I'm not worried about not being able to manage at home in my old age, what are you afraid of!"

"Migui's wife!" Aixiang grabbed her hand and earnestly enlightened her: "You didn't come to see them earlier, these two brothers were arguing to go to the front line, they almost quarreled to the point of not recognizing each other! Just let Mao Hai's father go, hang up a glorious sign, it's better than people saying you're backward! Our village will also be giving preferential treatment to military families and helping with farming, dozens of military families will have enough to eat and drink, what are you afraid of!"

"I understand, but -"

Someone outside the door shouted to go to the meeting, and no one cared to say anything further. They crowded out and the whole family went to the meeting place.

In the front yard of the village headquarters, two large red flags fluttered in the middle, and the brass band played majestic tunes. Five tables were arranged in a semi-circle, and the tables were piled with cigarettes, towels, peanuts, sesame candy, and hard-boiled eggs… More and more people crowded the courtyard around the tables, where more than twenty young men joining the army were seated, wearing red and green silk ribbons and a bright red flower on their chest. The sunlight shone brightly on the venue, and the red and green silk ribbons and big red flowers on the new soldiers swayed gently in the breeze, like a waving, curving, colorful wave in the sun.

As soon as the Gao brothers arrived, the village chief, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, the director of the Preferential Treatment for Military Families, etc., all came to welcome them. Two members of the Women's Federation put a red ribbon on Genzheng, and two members of the Children's Corps came to put a flower on him. Seeing that there was nothing for him to do, the second son immediately pouted, glaring at his brother with his ox-like eyes. Genzheng strode to the front of the rostrum and said to the village cadres, "Village Chief, my brother is also going!" Before he could finish, Old Man Gao also rushed up, coughing and saying, "That Chiang, if he is not defeated, it's no good! Liberation is our own business, and we must protect the fruits of liberation! Village Chief, let both my sons go together!"

The village chief discussed a few words with Comrade Wang who came from the district, and then put a red ribbon and a flower on Genyi, and let the brothers sit on a bench together. Genyi's embroidered satchel was quickly spotted by the women; they pointed and peeked from afar, eyes meeting eyes, giggling incessantly. Genyi quickly buried his face in his wrist on the table, not daring to look at them.

After the meeting was announced, the village chief, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and the director of the Preferential Treatment for Military Families all spoke. Comrade Wang from the district spoke, especially mentioning the Gao brothers, saying that one was the director of the Military Affairs Committee and the other was the leader of the Youth Team. In the past, they had led the liberation in the village and made many contributions to the masses. Today, they were taking the lead in joining the army to protect the fruits of liberation for the masses, which was truly adding merit to merit. A burst of cheers and applause welcomed them from the whole venue, and the Youth Team and the Children's Corps immediately shouted slogans: "It's glorious for brothers to join the army!" "Support cadres taking the lead in joining the army!" "When our elder brother goes to be a soldier, we will actively provide preferential treatment and work hard to produce!" "Although we are young, we can also carry water and chop firewood!"..."

Before long, the village chief suddenly shouted for everyone to be quiet and reported that Li Junqi, Erniu, and He Zhuzi had signed up to join the army on the spot. He asked what everyone's opinion was. After a burst of commotion, this time the women started shouting, "It's glorious for good men to join the army, and it's also glorious for military families at home!" The village chief, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, and Comrade Wang from the district put their heads together and whispered a few words, and they all said that He Zhuzi was too young, only sixteen years old, and would have to wait two more years. But Li Junqi and Erniu were both wearing red ribbons and flowers, and He Zhuzi started crying on the spot; many people tried to persuade him, saying that he would definitely be allowed to go in two more years, but he cried and said, "In two more years... do you think I don't understand?... in two more years, it will be too late - to defeat old Chiang!" In the end, everyone persuaded him, pushed him, and pulled He Zhuzi to the back of the crowd.

Everyone wanted the Gao brothers to speak first at the welcome for the new soldiers. Unexpectedly, Genyi was pushed up by the director of the Preferential Treatment for Military Families next to him. He looked at everyone, puffed out his chest and said, "I don't have anything to say either. If I don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, that big bully, I won't go home in this lifetime!" As he spoke, he punched the table with his fist, causing the whole audience to applaud wildly again.

"Everyone listen to me." Li Junqi, the newly recruited soldier, stood up and shouted: "Old Chiang has long sown hatred with us old farmers! If we don't defeat him, he will have to find a way to harm you! Those two Gao brothers are both cadres, they have all gone together, why shouldn't we go!"

While the new soldiers were getting up to speak one by one, Xiao Yu and her husband Zhao Migui happened to squeeze into the circle. Xiao Yu carried a quilt in her left hand and a pair of shoes in her right hand; Zhao Migui was covered in sweat, and said to the village chief's side, "I was late!" The cadres came to greet him, put on a red ribbon and a flower, and let him sit in the row of new soldiers. Two or three women came over to pull Xiao Yu, gossiping. Some asked, "I thought you wouldn't come!" Xiao Yu hesitated for a while, and then raised her head and replied: "He signed up early, how could he not come!"

It was noon, and the meeting was coming to an end. At this time, the Old People's Team suddenly popped out a voice: "Why don't we do a Yangko dance and sing a song to send them off?"

This proposal was like a pile of dry wheat straw catching fire, burning all over the venue with the wind, some talking, some laughing, shouting in a chorus.

"We are very much in favor. But who should take the lead in dancing?" This was shouted from the Youth Team.

Xuehua in the Women's Team, raised her hand, laughing and shouting: "Everyone knows that our Aixiang is a good Yangko dancer. Today, to send off her Genzheng, who else would lead other than her!"

Aixiang immediately blushed, and with a snap, slapped down Xuehua's raised hand. Xuehua nudged her a few times with her elbow, and Aixiang kept glaring at Xuehua. But with seven pushes and eight pulls, Aixiang was finally dragged to the middle of the venue. Twenty or thirty women, young people, children, etc. were behind Aixiang, determined to dance. The village chief immediately directed the crowd to retreat, making a big circle, and the brass band also started playing. Although Aixiang was so ashamed that her face was flushed and she was sweating non-stop, she was really happy in her heart, and naturally walked to the front and started dancing. After dancing a few circles in the sound of drums and music, she suddenly stopped the music with a gesture, turned around and asked everyone what to sing? Everyone said: "We are sending off you Genzheng and the others, it's up to you what you sing!" Aixiang turned to face the new soldiers, and pointed to her own husband with her finger, and said a little shyly: "Okay, you are the Eighth Route Army now, and we are the common people; go to the front and fight that bad thing old Chiang, we will still have to sing to support you!" As she spoke, they danced again in the sound of drums and music. The music was turned down, and everyone knew it was time to sing. At first, Aixiang sang a sentence first, leading everyone to dance and sing together; after that, Xuehua slowly used her eyes to tell everyone not to sing, and not to dance; everyone understood, and quietly retreated to squat around and laugh, leaving Aixiang alone on the field dancing around, singing with narrowed eyes, proud and out of touch -

"You love me, I love you; the army and the people are one family, you don't have to be polite… if your clothes are torn, I'll sew them for you, if they are dirty, I'll wash them for you..."

Genzheng was very anxious, and really felt sorry for his wife. But in front of everyone, although his heart was thumping, there was nothing he could do. When Aixiang discovered that there was no one behind her, she was even more ashamed, and ran back to the women in one breath, and the crowd applauded wildly, everyone could not help but laugh wildly, and a few members of the Children's Corps deliberately shouted loudly: "Support Aixiang's Yangko dance!" "Support the model of supporting the army!"

When leaving, Genzheng grabbed the village chief's hand and said: "Zhao Migui's family must be well taken care of! The village's militia must also be reorganized..." The village chief nodded, and he said: "I didn't speak at the meeting today, I will go to the front line to speak, use grenades to speak with the enemy, to let him know that I, the director of the Military Affairs Committee, am not simple!"

Five well-prepared horse-drawn carts were waiting in front of the headquarters. The Gao brothers were pressed down to sit at the head of the first cart. When all the soldiers were seated, the cartwheels began to rumble and turn.

　　参军 （续完）
    古今
    雪花走后，小鱼就挨近根正，等了好久才说：“你是武委会主任，我想问问你：这回参军，他——毛孩他爹，能不去不能？”
    高家弟兄急着要去开会，所以也不问个长短，根正就这样回答她：“赵米贵是自动报名的。像你家这些翻身农民，斗争果实要不要保卫？你们自己瞧着办吧！”
    “不是我要拖尾巴。你看我家又没个多的劳动，我也在妇救会办事，又拖个毛孩，那有那个时间闹生产！”小鱼说是说了，可看得出多少有点羞愧。
    高老汉气的直咳，站起来，用旱烟斗指着他两个儿子：“咱们今天——是刨地主老根哩！我家老大老二一齐叫去，我这大年岁不愁在家没法办，你还怕！”
    “米贵嫂！”爱香拉住她的手，恳切的开导她：“你早不来看，他们弟兄两个，都要争着上前线，差点吵得亲人都不认啦！就叫毛孩他爹去吧，挂上个光荣牌牌，不比人家说你落后强！咱村上也要优抗啦，代耕啦，几十家抗属都吃得上喝得上，你怕个啥呢！”
    “了解倒是了解，可是——”
    门外又有人叫开会，他们谁也顾不得再往下说，一拥出来，全家都到会场去了。
    村指挥部的前院，当中飘着两面大红旗，八音乐队奏着雄壮的曲子，五张桌子围成个半圆，桌上堆满了香烟、毛巾、花生、麻糖、熟鸡蛋……。桌子周围，坐着廿多个参军的青年，身上佩着红绿绸缎，胸前戴着一朵鲜红的花。阳光明晶晶的照着会场，越来越多的人群站了个满院。新战士身上的红绿绸缎和大红花，被微风吹得轻轻飘动，在太阳底下一荡一漾的，好像腾着一条弯曲的五彩的波浪。
    高家弟兄一到，村长啦，农会主席啦，妇救主任啦，……都过来欢迎他们。两个妇救会员给根正佩上红绸，两个儿童团员又来给他戴花。老二见没他的事，立刻撅起嘴唇，瞪着牛样的眼睛，一眼一眼瞧他哥哥。根正两大步趋到主席台前，对村干部们说：“村长，我兄弟也去咧！”不待说完，高老头也赶上去，咳着嗽说：“那个老蒋呀，不打垮就是个不成！翻身是咱自己的事，翻身果实就是得保卫哩！村长，我两个小子叫一齐去吧！”
    村长跟区上来的王同志商量了几句，又才叫给根义佩上红、戴上花，把他们弟兄让到一条凳子上坐下。根义那个绣花挂包，很快就被妇女们瞧见了；她们远远的指着偷看，眼睛对着眼睛，嘻嘻的笑个不住。根义赶快把脸埋在桌上的手腕里，一眼也不敢看她们。
    宣布开会过后，村长、农会主席、优抗主任都讲了话。区上的王同志讲话，特别提到高家弟兄，说他们一个是武委会主任，一个是青年队长，过去在村上领导翻身，为群众立了不少功劳，今天又带头参军，去为群众保卫翻身果实，实在是功上加功。一阵高呼，全场都鼓掌欢迎，青年队和儿童团，当时就喊起口号来了：“弟兄参军真光荣！”“拥护干部带头参军！”“大哥去当兵，我们要积极优抗，努力生产！”“我们虽然年纪小，挑水打柴也能干！“……”
    不大一会，村长突然喊叫大家静一点，报告李军旗、二扭、何柱子当场报名参军，看大家的意见怎样？一阵乱嚷过后，这回可是妇女开头喊：“好男儿去当兵，抗属在家也光荣！”村长、农会主席和区上的王同志，三个人凑在一块叽咕了几句，都说何柱子年纪太小，才十六咧，得过二年再去。可是李军旗、二扭都佩了红，戴了花，那个何柱子当场就啼哭起来；好些个人去劝，都说再过二年一定让去，他却连哭带说：“再过二年……你当我不了解，……再过二年，就误了——打老蒋啦！”结果，是大家劝的劝，推的推，把何柱子拉到了人群的后边。
    欢迎新战士讲话，个个都要让高家弟兄先讲。冷不防，根义叫旁边的优抗主任推了起来。他向大家瞧了一回，挺着胸脯说：“我也没那个话讲。不打倒蒋介石那个大恶霸，这辈子我就不回家！”说时用拳头在桌上一击，击的全场又疯狂的鼓起掌来。
    “大家听我说。”新报名的李军旗站起来叫：“老蒋早和咱老农民种下仇哩！咱不打垮他，他就得想法害你！那高家弟兄两个都是干部，人家一齐都去了，咱为啥不去！”
    新战士正在一个一个的起来讲话，小鱼和她丈夫赵米贵，恰好赶着挤进圈子里来。小鱼左手抱床棉被，右手提了对鞋；赵米贵满脸是汗，对着村长那边说：“可把时间给误啦！”干部们又到前面来待他，给佩了红，戴上花，让坐到新战士的一排。两三个妇女过来拉住小鱼，说长道短的。有的问：“我当你们不会来了哩！”小鱼迟疑了一会，又抬起头来回答：“他早报了名的，还能不来！”
    时间到了晌午，会也快开毕了。这功夫，老年队突然冒出一个声音：“我们为啥不扭个秧歌，唱个曲子欢送他们？”
    这个提议，就像一堆干麦秸着了火，一顺风便燃遍了全会场，说的说，笑的笑，嚷成一片。
    “我们很是赞成。可是叫谁带头扭呀？”这是青年队里喊出来的。
    妇女队中的雪花，高举着手，又是个笑，又是个叫：“谁都知道我们爱香是扭秧歌好把式。今天欢送她根正，不叫她带头还有谁！”
    爱香立刻红了脸，噼啪一声，打下了雪花举着的手。雪花用胳膊拐了她几下，爱香也不住的向雪花瞪眼睛。可是七推八拉的，爱香终被架到了会场的中间。二、三十个妇女、青年、儿童等在爱香背后，一定要扭。村长立刻指挥群众往后退，圈子让得大大的，八音乐队也吹打起来了。爱香虽然羞得满脸发热，不住的冒汗珠，可是心里又着实喜欢，自然而然的就走在前面扭开了。在鼓乐声中扭了几圈，她突然用手势止住了音乐，回头问大家唱个什么好？大家都说：“欢送你根正他们嘛，由你唱什么都好！”爱香转身对着新战士，还用手指着她自己的丈夫，有点儿娇羞的说道：“好，你们是八路军啦，咱们是老百姓；到前方好好打老蒋那个坏东西，咱们还得唱歌来拥护你们哩！”说着说着，她们又在鼓乐声中扭起来。音乐声放小，大伙知道该唱了。开头，是爱香先唱一句，领着大家一齐扭着唱；赶后，雪花慢慢用眼睛叫大家不唱了，也不要扭；大伙会意，都悄悄退出来蹲在周围发笑，掉下爱香单个人在场上扭来扭去，得意忘形的眯缝着眼睛唱——
    “你呀爱护我呀，我呀爱护你；军民本是一家人呀，您不要客气。……衣服破了我给你缝，脏了我给洗……”
    根正十分发急，心上着实替他妻子抱不平。但在众人面前，心地虽然卟咚咚的跳，他可也是个没法办。及到爱香发现自己后边已经没了人，她又害了羞，一股劲跑回妇女那边去了，群众狂热的鼓掌，那个也蹩不住狂笑，儿童团里还有几个故意高声喊：“拥护爱香扭秧歌！”“拥护拥军模范！”
    赶走的时候，根正拉住村长的手说：“赵米贵家可要好好照顾哩！村上的民兵也得整顿……”村长点了点头，他又说：“今天我在会上没讲话，我要到前线上去讲，用手榴弹和敌人讲，叫他了解我这个武委会主任不简单！”
    五辆套好的大车，早在指挥部门前等着。高家弟兄被按在第一辆车的当头坐下。待到战士们全坐好了，车毂轳就咕噜咕噜转动起来。
