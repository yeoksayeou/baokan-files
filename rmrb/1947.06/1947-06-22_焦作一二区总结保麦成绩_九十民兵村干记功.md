　　JiaoZuo First and Second Districts Summarize Wheat Protection Achievements
　　Ninety Militiamen and Village Cadres Receive Meritorious Service Awards

    [Report from this newspaper, JiaoZuo] The nineteen border villages of the First and Second Districts of JiaoZuo successfully completed the wheat harvest struggle. From May 21st to June 7th, they achieved complete clearing of the fields. In defending the wheat harvest, our militia fought the enemy a total of 66 times, resulting in 64 enemy casualties, including deaths, injuries, and captures. On the 7th of this month, an armed cadre meeting was held in DongZhangZhuang with twenty-three villages from the front and rear areas. The meeting summarized the protection of the wheat harvest and commended meritorious deeds. Initially, village cadres were praised for great achievements (such as GaoYaoHe planting sixteen landmines, and JinLiu injuring three enemies in ten days), but small achievements were not mentioned. Cadres praised the militia but not themselves. Villages in the rear felt that villages in the front could fight the enemy and make contributions, while villages in the rear had no merit. Later, ZhongWei village spoke about supporting XiaoZhaoZhuang in persisting on the mountain top for eight days and eight nights, eating only four meals in the first three days. Everyone considered this a contribution, which broke through the thinking that the rear had no merit to commend and small achievements could not be mentioned. During the commendation, ninety militiamen and village cadres were recorded for their meritorious service. During the commendation, everyone wanted to posthumously commend the sacrificed militiaman JinDaZhou. JinDaZhou was from BaiMaMen village and was very active in the YangJu and militia work team. On the night of the 31st of last month, DaZhou carried a carrying pole, a gun, and grenades, leading the villagers who had been transferred to the mountains back to the village to harvest wheat. He first went to the village to see if there was any enemy situation so he could call the masses back to the village. As soon as he returned home, he was surrounded by the secretly ambushing puppet self-defense corps and heroically sacrificed. Everyone posthumously evaluated his contribution and said: "JinDaZhou would rather die than surrender his gun, and sacrificed himself to prevent the masses from suffering losses. His contribution is the greatest."

　　焦作一二区总结保麦成绩
    九十民兵村干记功
    【本报焦作讯】焦作一二两区十九个边沿村庄，胜利完成麦收斗争，从五月二十一日起，到六月七日止，做到场光地净。在保卫麦收中，我民兵与敌作战仅以杀伤敌人有成绩的战斗计共六十六次，毙伤俘敌六十四个。本月七日，在东张庄召开了前后方二十三个村武装干部会，总结保卫麦收进行表功记功，开始各村干部光表大功，（如高窑河炸了十六个地雷，靳刘一人十天打伤三敌）不知表小功，干部表民兵不表自己，后方村觉得前方村能打敌人能立功，后方村没功，后来由中围村谈到支援小赵庄在山头上坚持了八天八夜，开始三天只吃了四顿饭，大家认为是功劳，这才打通了后方有功不能表和小功没法表的思想，在表功中有九十个民兵村干部都上了功劳簿。在表功中大家要给牺牲了的民兵靳大洲追记功劳。靳大洲白马门村人，在杨聚和民兵武工队里不管干啥都很积极，上月三十一日夜，大洲扛着扁担背着枪掂着手榴弹，引着他村转移到山上的老百姓，回村割麦，他先到村看有没有敌情好叫群众回村，他刚回到家，就被早埋伏好的伪自卫团包围住而英勇牺牲了。大家追评他的功劳说：“靳大洲宁死不缴枪，牺牲了自己也不叫群众受损失，就数人家功大劳。”
