　　[This newspaper's dispatch from Ji-Lu-Yu on the 12th] The Ji-Lu-Yu Daily and the Xinhua Branch are conducting the second submission contest, which has achieved new developments. In conjunction with land reform and attendance at work, it has powerfully promoted various tasks. Six Xinhua sub-agencies of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 7th, and 8th District Committees have been established, as well as 41 county communication stations in Guancheng, Pu County, and others. More than 50 kinds of small newspapers have been restored and founded. Among them, the "Grand Canal Newspaper" created by the 7th sub-agency, persisted in publishing on tour in the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines. Even though the enemy's main force was moving back and forth on the highway, the reporters still insisted on interviewing within one or two miles of the highway. The newspaper was often printed in villages one or two miles away from the enemy, and continuously sent manuscripts to the Xinhua Branch through hundreds of miles of guerrilla areas, powerfully promoting the guerrilla war in the 7th Military Sub-district and boosting the confidence of the military and civilians behind enemy lines. News communication work south of the Yellow River has also been widely carried out. Under extremely difficult conditions, the 5th District Committee created the "Southwest Shandong" small newspaper, the 3rd District Committee published "Huxi Communication," the 2nd District Committee restored "Huxi Times," and the 1st District Committee restored "Tai Xi Masses." Through hundreds of miles of guerrilla areas, a large number of manuscripts are still sent to the Xinhua Branch every day. The number of rural correspondents is also increasing daily, producing labor hero Li Shouchang as the banner of the worker-peasant correspondence movement. During the model hero establishment movement, the 8th District Committee called on the entire district to launch the Li Shouchang movement, which played a key and leading role in the communication work in Guancheng. During the movement, various places had new creations. The 2nd District of Gaoling launched a letter-writing movement, so leading comrades can understand the situation and grasp the work. In the conscription movement in Shou Zhang, the county party committee propaganda minister went all out to run the newspaper, so that news could be transmitted to various districts on the same day to inspire the emotions of the masses. Guancheng, Pu County, and other places created thousands of blackboard newspapers, which were welcomed and loved by the masses. In early May, the submission contest was summarized, and more than 500 model correspondents were honorably awarded in four months. It was also decided that from June 1st to the "September 1st" Journalist's Day, a further communication merit competition movement will be launched.
