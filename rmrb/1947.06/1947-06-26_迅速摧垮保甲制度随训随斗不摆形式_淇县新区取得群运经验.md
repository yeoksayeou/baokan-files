Rapidly Demolish the Baojia System, Train and Fight Simultaneously Without Formalities
Qixian New District Gains Mass Movement Experience

[This newspaper's Qixian dispatch] The mass movement in the new district is developing rapidly, with the Fifth District opening up the situation in four days. After completing the summer tilling in Xiatun in five days, the district seized the time to launch a vigorous anti-traitor, revenge, and general liquidation movement. From June 9th to 12th, in four days, it struggled against six people, including the head of the Hui team, Bu Gan, and the local despots Ge Ruizhen and Zhao Keren, opening up the situation in the entire district.

The first shot began with a joint struggle by more than 1,400 people from 15 villages, including Dongchang, against Bu Gan, the head of the Hui team under the command of the murderous demon king Hu Quanlu. This Hui team had been committing all kinds of evil deeds for six or seven years, and everyone, young and old, hated them with gnashing teeth. At the meeting, District Chief Yang solemnly called on everyone: seek revenge for grievances and redress injustices; the government will absolutely support you. Then, the masses from various villages scrambled to complain. A farmer from Baotun Village spoke first: "In the famine year, the common people had little to eat or drink, and you forced our village to provide two 'lid guns'. If we didn't buy them, we had to give you more than ninety *shi* of grain, which caused people in the village to flee or die..." Before he finished speaking, the whole place erupted. Some said their village provided two guns, some said their village provided seventy *shi* of grain, and countless villagers were forced to flee. Amidst the clamor, Grandma Jiang, a woman in her fifties from Xiantanggang Village, pointed at Bu Gan's head with her cane and said: "You inhuman wretch, you robbed my house clean two years ago, even my quilt and cloth bag were taken away. Your children and wife are living well, and I almost froze to death. Don't you think you should be punished?" Bu Gan had to bow his head and admit his mistake. Then, fifteen or sixteen people came forward to complain, seeking revenge for their fathers and redressing injustices for their mothers. Finally, at everyone's request, Bu Gan was shot on the spot. After the victory in the joint struggle against Bu Gan, struggles were launched in various villages. On the second and third days, more than 200 people from Miaokou struggled against the landlord Ge Ruizhen, and 500 people from the original Miao struggled against the local tyrant Zhao Keren. Subsequently, struggles were launched in villages such as Side, Gao Village, and Huazhuang. In four days, a total of more than 190 *mu* of land, 40 *shi* of grain, 4 livestock, and a large amount of furniture and clothing were seized. Now the masses in various villages are in high spirits and, regardless of enemy threats, are universally brewing and demanding to carry out struggles. The preliminary experiences of this movement are:

I. Universally, rapidly, and thoroughly destroying the set of *baojia* system by which the stubborn puppets have ruled the people for many years is an important link in quickly mobilizing the masses to rise up. Because most of the *baojia* chiefs are ruling figures and their loyal lackeys, if they are not destroyed, the people will think that the affairs of the village are managed by others and will not dare to rise up boldly. Experience has proven that waiting for the masses to be fully mobilized before reforming will greatly affect the rapid rise of the masses. Therefore, from the beginning, combine mobilizing the masses with replacing all the *baojia* chiefs in the entire district at once in two days, and let the masses (mainly the poor and hired laborers) elect their own leaders to establish a democratic regime. The masses are all happy and say: "Now we have a way, and from now on, we will be in charge of the affairs of the village!"

Mobilize men, women, young, and old together, opening up the movement in four days.

II. First, seize the time to train "activists" in large numbers, but when inspiring complaints and raising questions, and when everyone has a desire to struggle, struggles should be launched at any time. In addition to mass training by the district, training should also be conducted in villages and basic points. The main method is also to train and fight simultaneously. Solve problems as they arise, large problems with large struggles, small problems with small struggles, without following a set pattern of grand meetings or engaging in formalities. And distribute the fruits to the masses at any time (After the first recovery of Qixian City, first training and then following a set pattern, going back to the village to collude and slowly organize struggles, did not open up the situation). This greatly encourages the activists in the village, who then brew and collude to organize mass struggles, and the movement develops quickly, involving many people in the action.

III. Combining with the development of the movement, develop farmers' associations in large numbers. According to incomplete statistics, the entire district has developed more than 600 farmers' association members in four days. Pay attention to examination during development and clarify bad elements at any time. After the establishment of the farmers' association, all work is carried out through the farmers' association. The prestige of the farmers' association has been improved, becoming a banner for uniting the masses.

IV. This time in mobilizing the masses, we first proposed: "Mobilize men, women, young and old together, everyone progress and turn over a new leaf." We resolutely opposed the past practice of prioritizing men over women and abandoning children. In the Fifth District, in just four days, many women and children participated in training, meetings, complaints, and struggles, and two children even persuaded their fathers to complain at the meeting.

V. Target big targets and organize joint struggles, which can quickly promote the movement in various villages. For example, some villagers who participated in Bu Gan's struggle meeting said: "Now we have found the way. If we do it this way, we are not afraid that the local despots will not fall."

### 迅速摧垮保甲制度随训随斗不摆形式  淇县新区取得群运经验

　　迅速摧垮保甲制度随训随斗不摆形式
    淇县新区取得群运经验
    【本报淇县讯】新区群运迅速开展，五区四天打开局面。该区于五天内突击完成夏屯后，即抓紧时间开展轰轰烈烈的反奸复仇总清算运动。由六月九日到十二日四天中斗争了会队头子步干，恶霸地主葛瑞真、赵克仁等六人，轰开了全区局面。
    第一炮从东场等十五村庄千四百余群众集会，联合斗争杀人魔王扈全禄手下会队头子步干开始。该会队成立六、七年中，无恶不作，男女老少，切齿痛恨。会上首由杨区长慎重号召大家：有仇复仇，有冤申冤，政府绝对撑腰作主。接着各村群众争先恐后的诉苦，首先有鲍屯村一个农民发言：“灾荒年老百姓少吃没喝，你硬迫俺村拿两支盖板枪，没买到还得给你九十余石粮食，弄得村上逃的逃，死的死。…………”话音未落，全场吵成一片，有的说俺村出了两支枪，有的说俺村出粮七十石，村村被迫逃荒者不计其数。吵嚷中，仙谈岗村，五十余岁的姜老太太用拐丈指着步干头说：“你这个不是人养的孬种，前年把俺家抢的干干净净的，连我的被子、布袋都给抢光了，你家孩子老婆过好时光，叫我差点没冻死，你想该不该？”步干只得底头认错，随着就有为父报仇，为母申冤等十五六个人诉苦。最后在大家一齐要求下，步干当场被枪决。在联合斗争步干胜利后，各村都普遍的掀起了斗争，第二、三天即有庙口二百余群众斗争地主葛瑞真，原本庙五百群众斗争恶霸赵克仁、随后思德、高村、花庄等村均开展了斗争，四天中共斗出土地一百九十余亩，粮食四十石，牲口四头，家具衣服甚多，现各村群众情绪很高，不顾敌人威胁，各村都普遍的酝酿和要求开展斗争。这一运动初步经验是：
    一、普遍迅速彻底摧毁顽伪多年统治人民的一套保甲制度，是迅速发动群众起来的重要一环，因为所有保甲长大部都是统治人物，及其忠实走狗，不把他摧垮，人民认为村上事是人家当家，不敢大胆起来干，经验证明，等待群众充分发动起来再改造，就会大大影响群众迅速起来干。因此一开始结合发动群众，在两天内将全区所有保甲长一齐换掉，而随时由群众（主要是贫雇）自己选举，建立民主政权，群众都高兴的说：“这咱就有办法了，今后村上的事，就由咱当家啦！”
    男女老少一齐发动四天打开运动局面
    二、首先即抓紧大批训练“积极层”，但在启发诉苦、提出问题大家有了斗争要求时，即要随时开展斗争，除区大量训练外，又分村，分基点训练，主要方式也是随训随斗，有问题即解决，大问题大斗，小问题小斗，不按步就班等大会，摆形式。并将果实随时分给群众，（第一次收复淇县城后，先训练再按步就班，回村串通慢慢组织斗争，就未打开局面），这样对村积极分子鼓舞很大，回村酝酿串通组织群众斗争，运动发展得快，行动中卷入了很多群众。
    三、结合运动发展，大量发展农会，现据不完全统计，全区四天即发展了六百余农会员，发展注意审查，随时澄清坏分子。农会建立后，一切工作都通过农会。农会威信提高了，成为团聚群众的旗帜。
    四、这次发动群众，我们首先提出：“男女老少齐发动，人人进步好翻身。”坚决反对了过去先男后女丢儿童的作法。五区在短短四天内，不论受训、开会、诉苦、斗争都有许多妇女儿童参加站岗，有两个儿童，还劝他父亲在会上诉了苦。
    五、瞅准大的对象，组织联合斗争，很快的就能推起了各村运动，如有的村群众参加了步干的斗争会后说：“这才摸到了门路，这样干，不怕恶霸不垮台。”          （霍云桥）
