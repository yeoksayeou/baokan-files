　　Nanle Deepens Land Reform, Implements Large-Scale Exchange of Houses, Land, and Furniture
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu, 7th dispatch] Nanle is deepening land reform and implementing a large-scale exchange of houses, land, and furniture. At the beginning of this month, the county party committee, based on the principle of filling in gaps and leveling out differences, conducted a further in-depth inspection after the land and property had been distributed. It was found that although the land problem in the county had been initially resolved, in general, poor farmers had been allocated more distant and poor land, and some poor farmers were still living in bad houses, wearing tattered clothes, and using broken furniture and farm tools. Many landlords had retained good and nearby land, kept some good furniture and clothes, and concealed hidden wealth. The farmers felt that this was still unreasonable and urgently demanded a large-scale exchange. The county party committee and the democratic government approved this reasonable request from the masses. The villagers then launched a "compare with the landlords" campaign. During the large-scale exchange, who should exchange with whom, and what should be exchanged, were all decided by the poorest farmers through discussion. Several thousand poor farmers have already exchanged with landlords, and more than 500 female militiamen in the Fourth District helped the poor farmers move. The large-scale exchange and moving campaign is being carried out in depth.
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu, 7th dispatch] 15,000 liberated women in the Fourth District of Nanle elected their leader, Zhang Qiaoyun, as deputy district head. The election of the female district head was held at the same time as a commendation meeting for female heroes. Dozens of female heroes were on the podium, and more than 500 female militiamen stood tall, carrying guns. The masses offered wine and flowers to the heroes. After a heated discussion, Zhang Qiaoyun (formerly the director of the women's association in the Fourth District) was elected as the deputy district head. Everyone said, "With District Head Zhang to understand our suffering, we are not afraid of anything!" Currently, the women's movement in the district has expanded from investigating hidden wealth, acting as agents for militiamen in going to work and handling cases, demolishing temples, and dealing with unreasonable marriage issues, to universally cutting hair and releasing bound feet, while also developing female militias and deeply investigating land and wealth.
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu, 7th dispatch] The political consciousness of women in Fanxian has improved after liberation, and they are actively participating in review, production, political and other work. Women's militias and self-defense forces have been organized in the first, second, fourth, and fifth districts of the county, standing guard, watching, and checking household registration every day. In Zhuogao, Fifth District, one hundred female militiamen organized themselves and checked household registrations in the homes of landlords at night with red spears and broadswords. When they found hidden items, they immediately investigated and cleared them out. The female militia in Beiguan found two fugitive landlords, and they proudly escorted them to the county with guns on their backs. In the review, the female militia also took on the work of detaining and guarding landlords. After a woman in the First District discovered that the landlord Wan Shouguang had hidden many things, all the women launched a liquidation struggle against him, clearing out more than ten bags of wheat, two bundles, and farm tools. Everyone was in high spirits. In Xingyuan Village, Fifth District, with the active efforts of the women in the investigation, five large bundles were found in the landlord's house, including a pair of gold bracelets, a pair of silver bracelets, and other items. In addition, they are also combining this with production. A month later, forty-two women and twelve old men in Zhuzhuang organized five groups to pull seedlings in the fields, pulling a total of 120 mu in one day. Women in the Fifth District organized into production brigades, divided into seedling pulling, childcare, and cooking groups, with everyone dividing the work and cooperating.
