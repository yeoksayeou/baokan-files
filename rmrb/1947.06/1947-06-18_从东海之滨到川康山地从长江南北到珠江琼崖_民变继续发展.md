Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. According to a compilation of Shanghai newspaper reports: In the past two months, popular uprisings in the Jiang-controlled areas have continued to develop. People's militias in the suburbs of Shanghai have launched attacks from time to time. On April 2nd, the people's militia of Xuanqiao Township in Nanhui killed Zhao Mengju, a coach of the Jiang "Self-Defense Force," and four others, seizing more than ten guns. Jiang Yansheng, the chief of the guard unit of the Jiang-controlled Jiangzhen Township Office, was also killed by the people's militia. Xuan Tiewu, commander of Jiang's Songhu Garrison Headquarters, convened a meeting in early April to discuss so-called "strengthening public security" measures, deciding to install military telephones in various townships in Pudong and to deploy the armored vehicle battalion under his command to Pudong. Tasked with "suppressing" the activities of the people's militia in Wuhu, southern Anhui, on both sides of the highways in southern Anhui, at 10 p.m. on April 18th, two vehicles from Nanjing were ambushed by eight members of the people's militia at Daguan Mountain, less than a mile from Wuhu. On the same day, the Shengtong steamer of the Wuhu-Datong Bantai Chang Shipping Company, carrying military rice from Datong to Wuhu, was forced to stop near Sanshan Gorge by eleven members of the people's militia lying in ambush, who seized the military rice and other supplies. In the Ji'an area of Jiangxi, rebels are everywhere, with each sortie numbering over a hundred people, including women and children, who shout, "It's not illegal to rob for food." In the Mingshan area of Sichuan, peasants angrily killed Yang Fayuan, the Jiang-controlled township chief. The rebel armed forces in the Xindian Baizhang Township area of the county are fully armed. Hundreds of members of the people's militia in the Daquan Hejiagou area on the border of Sichuan and Kang launched a surprise attack on the Jiang army's defense zone on May 6th, with fierce fighting on both sides lasting for twenty-four hours. The Yi people of Puxiong have dispersed into smaller units, engaging in flexible guerrilla warfare. The Jiang party has selected several strategic areas to build thirty-nine bunkers for "defense." People's militias are active everywhere on the border of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guizhou. The Jiang-controlled Ministry of National Defense recently designated the "Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Border Region," stretching from the Yangtze River in the north to the old site of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway in the south, encompassing a total of forty-one counties, and established a "suppression" command, appointing Fu Zhongfang as the "commander." In Fengyetang Town, Putian, Fujian, a people's militia of over a hundred, led by a woman, launched a surprise attack in mid-April, cutting off power lines, arresting the town chief, and opening the granary, distributing over a thousand dan of stored grain to starving people in the vicinity. The development of armed popular uprisings in Guangdong has brought the main highway arteries in the area to a state of semi-paralysis. The 342-kilometer Guangzhou-Qujiang section of the northern Guangdong highway is entirely controlled by the people's militia. The section from Conghua to Wengyuan is frequently attacked by the people's militia. Even Zhang Fakui, director of the Jiang-controlled Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters, admitted: "There are at least fifteen thousand rebels in Guangdong and Guangxi. Apart from over a thousand in Guangxi, the rest are scattered throughout the Dongjiang, Hanjiang, Nanlu, Hainan Island, the Six Counties, and the border areas between Guangdong and Fujian, and across the border into Guangxi."
