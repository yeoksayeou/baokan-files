　　People's Power on Display
    A Record of the Exhibition Hall of Meritorious Service of the 32nd Unit

　　This is an ordinary village courtyard, now decorated with extraordinary objects. A tall, colorful archway is erected at the entrance. The spacious courtyard is filled with brilliant banners and congratulatory streamers. Crowds of men and women stream into the courtyard. What they see fills their faces with joyful expressions, and excited exclamations constantly come from their mouths. This is the exhibition hall of the Meritorious Service Conference of the 32nd Unit. Here, the power of the people's army is being reviewed in front of the people.

　　Room Two is already packed with visitors, all eager to linger a little longer in front of each new weapon. On display here are mostly light weapons. On a table covered with a clean white cloth are arranged twenty or thirty kinds of exquisite light machine guns. Against the corner of the wall, on a long table, are anti-tank rifles, American machine guns, and hand grenades. A green-painted rocket launcher is placed in the corner of the room. Excited conversations are bubbling among the crowd: "Comrade, what's the name of this gun!" "Canadian-style light machine gun." "And this one?" "Thompson submachine gun. These were all sent to us by American imperialism, through his adopted son Chiang Kai-shek." "Good, let Chiang Kai-shek's godfather give him more, and send them to us!..." Under the shed in the room is the exhibition area for mortars and small cannons. An old gentleman is lingeringly circling around a heavy mortar. He is from southern Hebei, representing the people of southern Hebei to offer their condolences to their soldiers. Now he sees the children who left their parents, growing and strengthening in more than a year of self-defense war. The old man, with an excited expression, touches the thick barrel of the cannon as if caressing a child he no longer recognizes. "It's different, it's different," he murmurs to himself, "With such weapons, how can we not win victories? Let these traitors and dictators taste our power..." Under the locust trees in the courtyard, a group of heavy artillery pieces are on display. A sweat-drenched speaker stands on the gun carriage, loudly explaining to the audience: "This is a Type 41 mountain gun, captured in the Pinghan Campaign; this is an anti-tank gun, a victory trophy from the Dingtao Campaign; this one is familiar to everyone, it's a howitzer captured in the Juye Campaign..." The audience surrounds each cannon, constantly asking detailed questions.

　　On the walls of Exhibition Room One, photographs of various battles are hung. From one photograph, you can see our soldiers charging towards the enemy's position; another records the scene of our soldiers destroying the enemy's bunkers with hand grenades; in another, a soldier is lying prone on a piece of concave ground, aiming at the enemy to shoot. This is our outstanding combat hero, Comrade Zhao Lanyuan. In the Dayang Lake battle, he single-handedly intercepted an enemy car, killed the enemies in the car with hand grenades, and then bayoneted an enemy battalion commander to death. Then he jumped into the car and seized many bullets and a mortar. The captured goods displayed here all mark the details of each fierce fight. Zhang Jiyuan, a decorated artillery hero, came to visit the exhibition hall. He stopped next to a mortar. When an audience member asked the speaker about the cannon, he answered in place of the speaker: "This is a cannon of the 67th Division of the Kuomintang 30th Army, captured during the Pinghan Campaign." "Did you participate in that campaign?" "No, I was liberated together with this cannon." Comrade Zhang Jiyuan was once forced to use this cannon to oppose the people of the liberated areas. Today, he is still using this cannon, but he has become a sharpshooter of the people's army, hitting the target every time, and has established merit in the people's liberation cause. Among our meritorious people, there are hundreds and thousands of Zhang Jiyuans. They are standing at the forefront of the battle, holding the guns and cannons sent by American imperialism through Chiang Kai-shek, and fighting resolutely against Chiang Kai-shek, the mortal enemy of the people.

　　Among the various charts that fill the exhibition room, a huge statistical table attracts the audience. This is the statistical table of the unit's achievements in the ten months of self-defense battles. It tells the audience that in ten months, this unit killed 14,380 enemies and captured 21,653 enemies (including 1,064 officers above the rank of lieutenant); seized 85 cannons of various calibers, 259 small cannons, 1,316 light and heavy machine guns, 16,258 rifles and carbines, 2,625,985 rounds of ammunition, 6,552 shells, and another 6 tanks, 54 cars, and 24 radios.

　　A congratulatory streamer is hanging above the entrance of the exhibition room, shining with four dazzling characters: "Stronger with Each Battle". Yes, the strength of the people's army has grown and strengthened in ten months of fighting. Soon, this force will appear on the front lines of the great counter-offensive. It will join with neighboring units to destroy the bloody rule of the traitorous fascists and liberate all the Chinese people from their clutches. (Ge Luo)

　　人民力量的检阅
    记三二部队功臣展览馆
    这是一个普通的乡村空院，现在却被一些不平常的物件装饰起来了。门口搭着高大的彩坊，宽大的院子，四周布满着灿烂的锦旗和贺幛，男女的人群川流不息地涌进院子里来。他们走过各个房间和院子里的每一个席棚，他们所看到的，使他们的脸上满含着欢喜的表情，兴奋的赞叹声不停地从他们的口里发出来。这里全是三二部队功臣大会的展览馆，在这里，人民军队的力量在人民面前举行检阅。
    二号房间里，早已被参观的人群挤的水泄不通了，人们都想在每一件新式武器前多停留一会儿。展览在这里的多是轻武器，在一铺有洁白案布的案子上，排列着二三十种精巧的轻机枪，靠墙角的条案上，则摆着战防枪、美式机枪和手榴弹。绿色油漆的火箭炮，放在房子的角落里。兴奋的谈话声，在人群中间沸腾着：“同志，这枪叫啥名字！”“加拿大式轻机枪”。“这个呢？”“汤母式手提冲锋式。这些都是美国帝国主义给咱们送来的，是托他的干儿子蒋介石给咱送来的。”“好呀，让蒋介石的干爸爸再多给他一些，给咱送来吧！…………。”在房子里的席棚下，是迫击炮和小炮的展览处。一位老先生恋恋不舍地在一尊重迫击炮跟前转来转去。他是从冀南来，代表冀南人民来向他们的子弟兵致慰问的，现在他看到离开父母的孩子，在一年多的自卫战争中成长壮大起来。老年人带着激动的表情，用手抚摸着粗大的炮身，像抚摸他认不得了的孩子。“不同了，不同了”，他喃喃自语着：“有了这样的武器，怎么能不打胜仗？让这些卖国贼独裁者。尝一尝咱们的厉害吧。……”院子里的槐树下面，一群重炮在陈列着，汗流满面的说明员站在炮腿上，大声地向观众作着说明：“这是四一式山炮，平汉战役缴获的；这是反坦克炮，定陶战役的胜利品；这个大家都认识了，就是鄄城战役缴获的榴弹炮…………。”观众围在每尊炮的四周，不住地发着详细的询问。
    一号展览室的墙壁上，挂满了各个战役的照片。从一幅照片上，可以看到我们的战士正向着敌人的阵地冲锋；另一幅记载了我们的战士，用手榴弹摧毁敌人地堡的情景；再一幅上面，一个战士正伏在一片凹地上瞄准敌人射击。这是我们出色的战斗英雄赵兰员同志。在大杨湖战斗中，他曾单身截住敌人的一辆汽车，用手榴弹打死了汽车上的敌人，又用刺刀挑死敌人一个营长，然后他跳上汽车，缴获了很多子弹和一门迫击炮。陈列在这里的战利品，都标志每一次激烈的搏斗详情。带红花的炮兵英雄张纪远同志到展览室里来参观，他在一门迫击炮旁站下来。当一个观众对这门炮向说明员发出询问的时候，他代替说明员作了回答：“这是国民党三十军六十七师的炮，平汉战役被缴获过来的。”“你参加了那次战役的？”“不，我是和这门炮一齐被解放的。”张纪远同志过去被迫带着这门炮来反对解放区人民，在今天他还是使用着这门炮，却成为百发百中的人民军队的神炮手，在人民解放事业上建立了功劳。在我们的功臣里面，有着成千成百的张纪远，他们正站在战斗的最前列，拿着美帝国主义经过蒋介石送来的枪炮，和人民的死敌蒋介石作坚决的斗争。
    在布满展览室的各式各样的图表中间，一幅巨大的统计表吸引了观众，这是这个部队在十个月自卫战斗中的战绩统计表，它告诉观众在十个月中间，这个部队共毙敌一万四千三百八十名，俘敌二万一千六百五十三名（内有尉级以上军官一千零六十四名）；缴获各种口径大炮八十五门，小炮二百五十九门，轻重机枪一千三百十六挺，步马枪一万六千二百五十八支，子弹二百六十二万五千九百八十五发，炮弹六千五百五十二发，另有坦克六辆，汽车五十四辆，电台二十四部。
    一面贺幛悬挂在展览室门口上面，闪耀着四个夺目的大字：“愈战愈强”。是的，人民军队的力量在十个月战斗中成长壮大起来了。不久以后，这支力量将出现在大反攻的前线上，它将和友邻部队一起，去摧毁卖国贼法西斯的血腥统治，把全中国人民从他的魔爪下解放出来。（葛洛）
