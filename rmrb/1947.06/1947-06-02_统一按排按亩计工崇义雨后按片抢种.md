　　Unified Arrangement, Work Calculated by Mu, Chongyi Seizes the Time to Plant After Rain by Area
    [Our paper's Wu'an dispatch] In Chongyi Village, Ninth District, on the afternoon of the 25th, after half a rain shower, as soon as the raindrops stopped, the mutual aid teams all went to the fields to check the moisture content and soak the flower seeds. Sun Wentang of Three Streets was the first to plant five mu while the ground was still damp, and over twenty mu were planted in Four Streets. In the evening, after mobilization by the mutual aid teams, unified plans were made. The next day, before dawn, all of the village's full and semi-labor force went to the fields together. The organizational method was for male full laborers to operate seed drills, dig ditches, and plow the land, doing the heavy work, while the elderly scattered seeds, and children and women assisted with the drills, planted beans, and delivered meals. In addition, Three Streets and Four Streets organized people to pull the seed drills, making a concentrated effort to seize the time to plant. The planting method was for each mutual aid team to plant according to the area assigned to them, with work calculated by the mu, and a work evaluation to be done at the end. Those who planted more would receive more work points, and those who planted less would receive fewer work points. People and livestock were given scores based on the strength of their labor, and all worked together to plant, calculating labor together, making sure that one area was planted before moving on to another, instead of planting one patch and then switching to another. The whole village planted a total of 1,610 mu of cotton, 158.1 mu of millet, 1 mu of corn, and 16.5 mu of mung beans in one day, for a total of 1,791.6 mu. The next day, another 383 mu were planted while the ground was still damp. Including dry planting and spot planting, a total of 2,264.4 mu had been sown. During the rush planting, the cooperative, oil mill, and even the livestock of the restaurants and vendors were all organized. The cooperative and mutual aid teams helped the widowed and childless households who did not have labor to plant as well. Four Streets originally planned to plant 250 mu, but exceeded that by 120 mu, and Five Streets also exceeded the plan by 43 mu. In Three Streets, each animal planted an average of more than ten mu. Village Chief Yang Guozhu planted 16 old mu with one donkey, including planting and harrowing. Sun Linyou and Sun Suozhu planned to plant only nine mu in half a day pulling the seed drill, but completed fifteen mu. Sun Yinbao and Sun Wentang, two full laborers from Three Streets, worked with two children to pull the seed drill, planting seven mu of millet in half a day. Wang Yuanqing's group from Five Streets, with four donkeys and eight laborers, planted sixty-six mu in one day. Wang Quanyi's group, with two animals, originally planned for twenty-seven mu, but exceeded that by thirteen mu. The whole village is still taking advantage of the damp ground to rush the planting, with the slogan "If the soil isn't dry, the drill won't be idle; plant as much as you can!"
