　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Comprehensive report: American imperialism is extremely shocked by the failure of its running dogs in Hungary and the victory of Hungarian people's democratic forces. It has been spreading rumors and slanders in an attempt to create new disputes, which has aroused fierce criticism from Hungarian public opinion. The Hungarian National Committee held a meeting on the 6th and passed a resolution refuting the absurd slanders and rumors circulating abroad. The resolution stated: "The government crisis was resolved within 48 hours, and Hungary has fully entered peace and stability. The distribution of seats among the parties in the government remains the same as before." The committee accused individual Hungarian diplomats stationed abroad, who, under the instructions of reactionaries at home and abroad, discredited Hungarian democracy, of being traitors to the motherland. The Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister criticized the United States for stopping loans to Hungary at a workers' conference, saying: "Of course, our situation is not as satisfactory to the United States as that of Greece." Former Hungarian President Mihály Károlyi declared: "We Hungarians do not want to be slaves of the United States." Károlyi also specifically emphasized the importance of good-neighborly relations, especially with the Soviet Union. Szabad Nép pointed out: The reorganization of the Hungarian government was merely the replacement of two rebellious anti-democratic elements of the two small landowner parties by democrats from those parties. Dénes replaced Nagy as Prime Minister, and Mihályfi replaced János Gyöngyösi as Foreign Minister. The other ministers remained unchanged. But the enemies of the Hungarian Republic are trying to portray this event as a purely "Communist coup." Why are they so hysterically agitated? It is clear that the executors of their poisonous scheme have been purged from the Hungarian government. The newspaper declared in another editorial: Hungary must reject the interference of foreign reactionaries in its internal affairs. If the United States offers surplus material loans only to Nagy and not to the Hungarian democratic government, we will reject the American loans. Although we are poor, we will never sell our freedom. The editorial also severely condemned the slanderous remarks of the British, French, and Swiss reactionaries, headed by Bevin and De Gaulle, and their newspapers against Hungarian democracy. Note: Since Nagy resigned in fear of punishment, and the Hungarian government was reorganized on the 31st, Marshall successively proposed on the 2nd and 3rd to suspend the $30 million surplus material loan to Hungary and withdraw the Export-Import Bank's $7 million loan for raw materials and cotton to Hungary. Senate Speaker Vandenberg proposed that the United Nations investigate the situation in Hungary. They also mobilized their partners and their newspapers to slander the Hungarian Communist Party and the Soviet Union, and at the same time instructed some Hungarian reactionary diplomatic representatives to oppose the new government. According to Austrian newspapers, Nagy may visit the United States recently to establish closer ties with the United States. According to the United Press, the Hungarian reactionaries may play the role of a government in exile.

　　匈牙利人不愿做美国的奴仆
    决不因贫困出卖自己的自由
    【新华社陕北八日电】综合报导：美帝国主义因其在匈的走狗阴谋失败，匈牙利人民民主力量获得胜利，极为震惊，并大肆造谣诽谤，企图制造新纠纷，已引起匈牙利舆论猛烈抨击。匈民族委员会于六日开会，通过决议，驳斥国外所流传的荒唐的诽谤和谣言。决议称：“政府危机在四十八小时内即已解决，匈国已全然进入和平与安定。各党在政府中的席位分配依然如旧。”委员会指斥在国内外反动派指使下诋毁匈牙利民主的个别留驻国外的外交人员为祖国的叛徒。匈副总理在工人大会上抨击美国停止对匈贷款谓：当然，我国的情况是不像希腊那样令美国满意的。匈前总统米海尔·凯洛里宣称：“我们匈牙利人不愿做美国的奴仆。”凯氏并特别强调敦睦友邻关系的重要，特别是与苏联。萨巴德·涅普报指出：匈政府改组，仅是两个小地主党的民主派代替了该党的两个反叛的反民主分子。丁尼斯代替奈基为总理，尼哈西费代替杨约西为外交部长，其余部长均未更动。但匈牙利共和国的敌人企图将这一事件说成纯系“共产党政变”。为什么他们这样歇斯底里的激动呢？显然的是因为他们毒计的执行者已自匈政府中被清除出去。该报在另一社论中宣称：匈牙利必须拒绝外国反动派对其内政的干涉，如果美国剩余物资借款仅贷给奈基而不贷给匈牙利民主政府，我们就拒绝美国的贷款。我们虽然贫乏，但我们决不出卖我们的自由。社论并严厉斥责以贝文、戴高乐为首的英、法、瑞士的反动派及其报纸对匈牙利民主的诽谤谰言。按：自奈基畏罪辞职，匈政府于三十一日改组后，马歇尔即于二、三两日连续提议停止对匈三千万元剩余物资借款，并撤回进出口银行对匈七百万元原料及棉花借款。参院议长范登堡则提议要求联合国调查匈牙利之情势。彼等并动员其伙伴及其报纸大事诽谤匈共及苏联，同时并指使一部分匈牙利反动外交代表反对新政府。据奥国报纸揭露：奈基可能于最近访美，与美国取得更密切联系。据合众社透露：匈反动派可能扮演流亡政府。
