【Report from This Newspaper in Pingshun】After cotton and Golden Queen corn were sown in Dongqing North Village, Fifth District, a mass merit citation conference was held in the village on the night of the 16th of last month. At the beginning, the masses were unwilling to speak, not reporting their own merits or mentioning others. After mobilization, they enthusiastically started reporting. Song Fake reported the exemplary deeds of model worker Song Xiaoqiu: He compared three Golden Queen corns with six local corns, enlightening everyone's thinking and promoting the planting of more than 500 mu of Golden Queen corn in the village. He led everyone to fight against the drought, carrying water to plant more than 500 mu of cotton. He personally went to the district cooperative to buy flower seeds, saving labor. Moreover, one day after sowing, he calculated the labor and animal power of the whole village and extracted seven animals to pull coal, earning 35,000 yuan in two days. He lent a piglet to the dependents of a martyr, Song Quanshui, to help him develop his production and become prosperous. Before these specific facts were finished, the audience commented one after another: "Xiaoqiu is planning for everyone's prosperity like this. He has made a great contribution in agriculture and a small contribution in sideline occupations." The masses, with the same excitement, very seriously reported the merits of Song Xiaoqiu and 72 others, as well as two mutual aid teams. Then, after the merit evaluation committee evaluated and judged, they were written on the merit list and posted on the main street. The masses crowded around to look at it, holding bowls. Those who were illiterate also squeezed in, wanting to listen. While looking, everyone argued: "If you get rich and get a merit recorded, you really get both fame and fortune." The merit list aroused everyone's enthusiasm for vying for merit. The conference called for seizing the time to sow by the mu. Each team and group took the initiative to challenge and compete, striving to complete the task first. The experts at sowing always dug up the soil to see how much the mu yielded before putting in effort, wanting to capture the seedling and gain merit. Those who harrowed the land harrowed back and forth, turning five-finger-thick dry soil into three-finger-thick soil. The labor force of the cooperative also automatically came out to participate, completing the sowing of 500 mu of valley land in three days. The children competed to catch black bean worms, and there was not a single idle person in the village. (Rixin, Yan Fa)

【Report from This Newspaper in Huguan】All district cadres in the Fourth District conducted their first merit summary on May 28. The process was as follows: first, individuals reported their own merits, then they mutually reported merits, then the group deliberated and researched, and finally the conference evaluated and selected. The evaluation was mainly based on three aspects: work performance, production savings, and writing contributions. After evaluation, comrades Hou Renti, Ma Tongmao, Zhang Jiaolong, and Yuan Geniang were selected for a major merit once. Yuan Senqing, et al.... Seventeen comrades were credited with minor merits. The evaluation was very cautious and the mood was high. Finally, the slogan "Strive for more merits next time" was put forward. Encouraged by this slogan, all cadres were full of confidence in gaining merit and were determined to make more contributions in their work. (Tongren, Jin Tun)

　　开展表功评功推动生产热潮
    东青北村开群众立功大会
    【本报平顺讯】五区东青北村棉花、金皇后下种以后，于上月十六日夜，召开全村群众立功大会，开始群众不愿说，不报自己功劳也不提别人，经动员以后，才热烈的报起来。宋法科报出劳英宋小秋的模范事迹：他用三个金皇后，六个土玉茭剥下来比较，打通大家思想，推动全村下种金皇后五百余亩；领导大家同天旱作斗争，担水栽种棉花五百余亩；亲自到区联社购买花籽，节省劳力，而且在下种后一天就计算全村劳、畜力，抽出七头牲口去拉炭，两天时间赚洋三万五千元。借给干属宋全水小猪一个，帮助其生产发家。这些具体事实未说完，会场便纷纷评论：“小秋这样为大家发家打算，农业上立一大功，副业上立一小功。”群众以同样兴奋的心情很认真的给宋小秋等七十二人及两个互助组报了功劳，然后又经评功委员会评判后写在功劳榜上，贴在大街。群众端着碗挤着看，不识字的人也挤在那里想听听。大家一边看，一边吵：“发了财记功劳，真是名利双全。”功劳榜引起大家的争功的热情。大会号召抢垧下种，各队各组就先后自动挑战竞赛，争先完成，摇耧的能手们每到一块地总是先刨看垧土，足着一股劲，要捉苗立功劳。耙地的是横顺翻来覆去的耙，五指厚的干土要耙成三指厚，合作社的劳力也自动出来参加，三天完成了五百余亩谷地的下种。小儿童在争先恐后的捉黑豆虫，全村无有一个闲人。（日新、阎法）
