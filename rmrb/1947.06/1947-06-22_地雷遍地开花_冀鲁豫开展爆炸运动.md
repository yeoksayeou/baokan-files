　　Landmines Blossom Everywhere
    Hebei-Shandong-Henan Carries Out Explosive Warfare
    [Our Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch of the 20th] The First and Seventh Military Sub-districts have achieved significant results in landmine warfare. In Changqing County of the First Military Sub-district, 21 enemies were killed in three explosions. Jin Yisan, the combat section chief of the county's Armed Forces Committee, led militiamen to pull the detonators three times. The first time, when the enemy occupied Changqing, he led the explosion training class to bury landmines at the intersection of Wuzi Village, killing two enemies. The second time, he buried 12 landmines on the Xin Dianzi highway in the Second District, killing nine enemies. The third time, he killed an enemy special agent in Madong Village, earning him the heroic title of "Explosion Pioneer" from the Armed Forces Committee. Yang Haizhai, director of the Armed Forces Committee of the Seventh Military Sub-district, personally led militiamen to bury landmines, resulting in seven explosions, killing or wounding 17 enemies. In × County, the Chiang Kai-shek troops at Black Tiger Temple used to frequently "sweep" the area in an extremely frenzied manner. After our landmines exploded near their stronghold, they dared not venture out, and even when they did, it was no more than five li at most. Large groups of enemies dared not use roads when "sweeping," instead traveling through wheat fields. As a result, the masses' confidence in persisting in guerrilla warfare has greatly increased. In order to further develop the landmine explosion movement, the Border Region Armed Forces Committee has called on armed cadres in the guerrilla areas to take the lead in rapidly and universally spreading the sporadic landmine warfare throughout the region, and emphasized that cadres personally taking action to make a breakthrough is the key to developing landmine warfare. At the same time, due to the crisscrossing roads and vast terrain on the plains, and the initial lack of skill in laying landmines and inaccurate intelligence, careful study is necessary to grasp the enemy's movement patterns, and landmines must be combined with tunnels at important intersections that the enemy is sure to pass through, to doubly exert the power of landmine explosions on the plains.

　　地雷遍地开花
    冀鲁豫开展爆炸运动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】一、七分区地雷战，已获得重大成绩。一分区长清县在三次爆炸中，炸死敌人二十一名。县武委会作战股长金益三同志领导民兵三次拉雷，第一次于敌人占领长清时，他领导爆炸训练班在五子村路口埋雷，炸死敌人二人；第二次在二区辛店子公路上埋雷十二个，毙敌九名，第三次在马东村又炸死敌特务一名，获得了武委总会“爆炸先锋”的英雄荣誉。七分区武委会主任杨海砦同志，亲自带领民兵埋雷，七次开花，毙伤敌人十七名。×县黑虎庙之蒋军过去经常四出“扫荡”，极为疯狂，当我地雷在其据点附近开花后，即不敢外出活动，出来时亦最多不过五里。大股敌人外出“扫荡”，不敢走道路，从麦地里走。因而群众对坚持游击战争的信心大大提高。边区武委会为进一步开展地雷爆炸运动，号召游击区武装干部带头把零星的地雷战迅速普遍全区，并着重指出干部亲自下手，突破一点，是开展地雷战的关键。同时由于平原上道路纵横，地势广阔，开始下雷技术不高，情报掌握不准，必须细心研究，掌握敌人行动规律，在敌人必经的重要路口上经常做到地雷与地道结合，加倍发挥平原上地雷爆炸的威力。
