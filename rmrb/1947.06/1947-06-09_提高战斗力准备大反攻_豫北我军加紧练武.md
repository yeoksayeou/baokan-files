　　Improving Combat Effectiveness to Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive
    Our Army in Northern Henan Intensifies Training
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front, June 7th] The People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng is intensifying training, learning skills, and improving its military and political quality during breaks in combat. After the May 1st editorial "Fully Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive" was issued, the front-line units immediately began discussions and designated "Fear and Fearlessness" and compiled current affairs teaching materials as supplementary documents. The Huai River troops adopted the mass line and practical learning methods in their studies. The 112th unit even formulated a combat learning plan. The soldiers' current affairs studies adopted a "three-in-one" learning method, with veteran soldiers, new soldiers, and newly liberated soldiers comparing the past and present, and comparing the situation of our army growing stronger with each battle and the enemy growing weaker, inspiring each other. After the current affairs studies of the Huai River and other troops, they have now turned to military training, proposing the slogan of officers and soldiers teaching and learning from each other. Combat heroes, model workers, and new and veteran soldiers exchange combat experiences, and various corps hold Zhuge Liang symposiums to study various techniques. The 45th unit also put forward four requirements in training: completing tasks tenaciously and bravely, developing wartime mutual assistance, strictly abiding by mass discipline, and abiding by the policy on prisoners of war, as well as two points of attention: respecting time and improving vigilance. The corps are intensifying training day and night to achieve meritorious service. Throughout the villages where the various units are stationed, whistles and gunshots can be heard everywhere. Roofs, walls, and trenches are filled with exercises on storming fortifications, breaking through deer fences, sweeping mines, and erecting pontoon bridges. Cadres and soldiers from the military, political, health, and supply departments of various units are all involved in the training upsurge. The combat hero Wang Xuezhi's squad was divided into three mutual aid groups, and a training plan was drawn up. Zhou Tianzeng, a soldier in the squad, increased his grenade throwing distance from 36 meters to 40 meters. A new soldier in the machine gun squad scored 22 rings with three shots.
