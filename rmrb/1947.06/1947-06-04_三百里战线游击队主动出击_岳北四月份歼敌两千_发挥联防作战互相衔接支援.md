(Our dispatch from Taiyue, 1st) The combination of land reform and the killing of enemies in competition has led to unprecedented achievements in the guerrilla warfare in the border areas of the five counties of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, and Zhaocheng in northern Yue (northern Taiyue). In April alone, militiamen engaged in over 360 battles, killing or capturing 1,026 officers and soldiers of the stubborn Yan faction, including regimental commanders and below. Local military groups and guerrilla units killed over 1,200 enemies. Two county seats, Zhaocheng and Huoxian, were captured, along with three important strongholds: Jingsheng, Jinzhuang, and Dongguo. The ratio of enemy casualties to our own increased from 3:1 in December of last year to 85:1. The tactical characteristics of these victories are: first, the transformation from small-scale, fragmented activities of militiamen and guerrillas to powerful offensives with a high degree of organization and planning. Militiamen and guerrillas simultaneously attacked along the 300-li front from Pingyao in the north to Zhaocheng in the south, putting the enemy in a completely passive and defensive position. The militiamen and guerrillas repeatedly achieved victories, exceeding the monthly enemy killing plan by 60 within half a month. Second, overcoming the past purely military perspective and transforming it into a mass-based armed struggle to divide and protect land. Guerrilla warfare and land reform supported each other and developed together. Before its liberation, Huoxian implemented a policy of simultaneous military offensives and land reform. Lingshi unified the deployment of killing enemies and dividing land into three defense lines, penetrating enemy strongholds to divide land. Pingyao and Jiexiu used methods such as armed offices and armed work teams to carry out enemy killing and land reform. Many dual heroes emerged in various counties, excelling in both fighting and land redistribution. Third, the display of a high degree of joint defense operations. Lingshi County was divided into three major defense lines, with lines connecting and supporting each other. Jiexiu, after creating the "bee-like joint defense," conducted 56 joint defense operations in one and a half months from March 20th to May 9th, wounding 185 enemies. The Yindi joint defense in Huoxian repelled several major offensives by over a thousand enemies. Fourth, landmine warfare transformed from past defense to active offense. When attacking Pingyao, militiamen buried mines in front of enemy strongholds and hung them on碉堡 [diaobao - pillboxes]. Zhaocheng used methods such as "get up and don't go" and "chain mines" to launch explosive offensives against the enemy. Zhaocheng and Lingshi counties planted 780 mines in one month, killing or wounding 134 enemies. Currently, Zhaocheng and Hongdong are forming a steel joint defense to encircle Hongdong and protect the wheat harvest.

(Our dispatch from Taiyue, 1st) The Lingshi militiamen are operating close to the outskirts of the county seat, killing, wounding, or capturing 60 enemies. The Yan army in the city is terrified, and social order is in chaos. On the night of the 12th of last month, the Shuiyu militiamen fired two shots outside the city, causing the Yan army, the county government, and its subordinate agencies to scatter in panic and flee to the west of the river for refuge. They returned to the city in a disheveled state at dawn and hastily convened an emergency meeting, lamenting that the situation was critical and that all agencies should prepare for war immediately. On the 14th, they transported the case files to Jiexiu and dismantled the railway from Fojiatan to ×头 [X Tou - could not resolve character]. For days, the military police were all dispatched to arrest men in the city, ordering each person to prepare a shovel and 50 catties of rice and flour to await orders. The city has become a world of terror. There are several cases of young people committing suicide by jumping into wells or taking poison every day to avoid being arrested. A merchant was forced to drink kerosene and died, and three young men, unable to hide, jumped into water tanks and drowned. Our armed village government and militiamen have warned the Yan puppet compiled villages to rescue innocent youth, ordering them to immediately stop arresting men or to cover up the escape of the youth, otherwise they will be severely punished.

　　三百里战线游击队主动出击
    岳北四月份歼敌两千
    发挥联防作战互相衔接支援
    【本报太岳一日电】土地改革与杀敌竞赛相结合，使岳北（太岳北部）边沿区平（遥）、介（休）、灵（石）、霍（县）、赵（城）五县的游击战争获得空前成绩。在四月份一个月内，民兵作战三百六十余次，毙俘阎顽团长以下官兵一千零二十六名。地方兵团及游击队杀敌一千二百余人。攻克赵城、霍县县城两座，静升、金庄、东郭等重要据点三处。在我敌伤亡比例上，由去年十二月份的一比三增至一比八十五。这些胜利的战术特点：第一是由民兵游击队的小股零碎活动，变成强大的有高度组织性与计划性的攻势。民兵游击队在北起平遥，南至赵城三百余里的战线上同时出击，使敌人完全处于被动挨打状态，民兵游击队则迭获胜利，半个月就超过一个月的杀敌计划六十名。第二是克服了过去单纯的军事观点，变为群众性的武装分田保田斗争，游击战与土地改革相互依托，相互发展。霍县在未解放以前，曾经推行了军事进攻与土地改革齐头并进的方针。灵石将杀敌分田统一的布置成三道防线，并深入到敌据点分田。平遥、介休用武装办公室及武装工作队等办法，进行杀敌与土地改革。各县涌现了许多打仗翻身双英雄。第三是发挥了高度的联防作战。灵石全县划分三道大防线，线与线互相衔接，互相支援。介休自创造蜜蜂联防后，三月二十日到五月九日一个半月内，即联防作战五十六次，打伤敌人一百八十五名。霍县阴底联防，数次打退千余敌人的大进攻。第四地雷战由过去的防御变为积极的进攻。进攻平遥时，民兵把雷埋在敌人据点前、挂在碉堡上。赵城用“起不走”、“连环雷”等办法，向敌人展开爆炸进攻。赵城与灵石两县，一个月埋雷七百八十颗，炸死炸伤敌人一百三十四名。现赵城与洪洞正组成钢铁联防，围困洪洞，保卫麦收。
    【本报太岳一日电】灵石民兵迫近该县城郊活动，先后毙伤俘敌六十人，城内阎军闻风丧胆，社会秩序已呈混乱。上月十二日夜，水峪民兵在城外打了两枪，城内阎军县政府及所属机关一哄而散，仓惶逃至河西避难，天明方狼狈回城，连忙召开紧急会议，哀叫形势吃紧，各机关应即备战。十四日便把事卷运往介休，并将富家滩至×头铁路拆除。连日军警全部出动，在城内大肆抓丁，并下令每人准备铁锹一把，米面五十斤听候命令。城内已成恐怖世界。青年为避抓丁，跳井服毒自杀者日必数起。某商人被逼服煤油而死，三个青年无法躲藏，跳进水缸淹死。我武装村公所及民兵为拯救无辜青年，已向阎伪编村提出警告，命令他们即刻停止抓丁或掩护青年逃亡，否则将受严重制裁。
