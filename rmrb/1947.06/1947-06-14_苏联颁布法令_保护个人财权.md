TASS reports: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has recently issued an order to strengthen the protection of citizens' personal property (Note: Soviet citizens can use income earned through labor to acquire personal items such as furniture, clothing, books, musical instruments, cars, sewing machines, etc. to meet their own needs.
