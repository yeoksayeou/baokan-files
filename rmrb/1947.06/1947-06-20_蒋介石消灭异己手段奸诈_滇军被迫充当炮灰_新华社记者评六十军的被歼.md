Xinhua News Agency, Northeast China, June 18th - A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented on the annihilation of the Yunnan Army's 184th Division and Provisional 21st Division, saying: The most disastrous defeat in our army's summer offensive was the annihilation of two entire divisions (the 184th Division and the Provisional 21st Division) of the Yunnan Army's 60th Army, who were led by the nose by Chiang Kai-shek and became sacrifices in the civil war. One division commander was captured, one division commander was wounded and his whereabouts are unknown, and one deputy division commander was killed. More than 3,000 officers and soldiers suffered unnecessary sacrifices, and more than 12,000 were captured. Why did the 60th Army fail so miserably? The most central reason should be said to be Chiang Kai-shek's premeditated scheme to eliminate dissidents. As early as September of the previous year, Chiang Kai-shek used a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain, transferring the Yunnan troops to Vietnam to "accept surrender," and then used treacherous means to send Du Yuming to attack Kunming. This move was not enough. He was afraid that the Yunnan troops would cause trouble after "accepting surrender" and returning home, so he transferred them from the South China Sea to the Northeast civil war battlefield thousands of miles away, and placed them under the command of Du Yuming, the culprit of the "Kunming Incident." Wasn't this clearly telling them to go to their deaths from afar?

　　It goes without saying that Du Yuming's treatment of this "dissident" force was nothing more than failing to replenish casualties after battles, adopting the method of drawing firewood from under the pot, training the officers below, dispatching special agents, and carrying out disintegration, etc. Especially since the anti-civil war uprising of the 184th Division in Haicheng under the leadership of General Pan Shuoduan in May of last year, Du immediately collected the remnants, sent a large number of henchmen, as well as reactionary officers and soldiers from the New First Army and New Sixth Army, to reorganize and replenish them, completely controlling this force. He placed the 184th Division and the Provisional 21st Division in the key areas of Meihekou and Hailong to guard the gate for him, as a shield. The 184th Division was forced to act as cannon fodder in the invasion of Linjiang several times. In the Battle of Meihekou, Du Yuming repeatedly ordered "die-hard defense," not hesitating to sacrifice these Yunnan troops, and even used machine guns to supervise the battle, carrying out cruel suppression. As for the Provisional 21st Division, when it abandoned Hailong and fled towards Changchun, the New First Army remained unmoved. With pursuers behind and ambushes ahead, they had no choice but to turn back to Jilin to escape, and only one battalion of the 182nd Division of the 60th Army came to their rescue, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Provisional 21st Division.

　　Batches of Yunnan officers once again learned that the way to save them is to lay down their weapons. However, this is ultimately a passive method. In front of all the miscellaneous armies in the Northeast, there is already a bright road, which is the road of General Pan Shuoduan, bravely and resolutely standing on the side of the people, and holding high the banner of opposing the traitorous civil war dictatorship, which is the Democratic Allied Army led by General Pan Shuoduan.

　　蒋介石消灭异己手段奸诈
    滇军被迫充当炮灰
    新华社记者评六十军的被歼
    【新华社东北十八日电】本社记者评论滇军一八四师暂二十一师的被歼称：在我军此次夏季攻势中失败得最惨的，是被蒋介石牵着鼻子走作为内战牺牲品的云南部队六十军整整两个师（一八四师和暂二十一师）的被消灭。一个师长被擒，一个师长负伤，下落不明，一个副师长被击毙。官兵遭受无谓牺牲的达三千多人，被俘达一万二千以上。六十军为什么会失败得这样惨呢？最中心的一个原因，应当说这是出于蒋介石消灭异己的预谋。蒋介石早在前年九月，一个调虎离山之计，将云南部队调到越南去“受降”，随即以奸诈的手段，派遣杜聿明袭取了昆明。这一着还嫌不够，他害怕云南部队“受降”完毕，回家多事，就又把他们从南海之滨调到远隔万里的东北内战战场来，而且恰恰又放在“昆明事件”祸首杜聿明的指挥之下，这不是明明叫他们远道送死？   杜聿明对待这支“异己”部队，不用说无非是打了仗以后的伤亡，不予补充，采取釜底抽薪的办法，调训下面的军官，派遣特务，实行分化等等。尤其自去年五月一八四师在潘朔端将军率领下于海城举行反内战起义后，杜贼赶紧收集其残部，遣派大批爪牙，以及新一军、新六军的反动官兵，加以改编整补，将这支队伍完全控制在自己的掌握底下，把一八四师和暂二十一师摆在要冲之地梅河口、海龙替他看守大门，作为一块挡箭牌。一八四师曾几次被迫使充当进犯临江的炮灰，而这次梅河口之战，杜聿明还几次电令“死守”，不惜拿这些云南部队作牺牲，甚至用机枪督战，进行残酷的镇压。而暂二十一师，当其丢掉海龙向长春方面奔逃时，新一军是按兵不动的。在后有追兵，前有埋伏的情况下，他们只好折转回吉林逃命出来，而接应的也只有六十军一八二师的一个营，结果就落得个暂二十一师全部覆没。
    成批的云南军官，再一次知道了挽救他们的办法，是放下武器。不过，这究竟就是消极的办法，摆在东北所有一切杂牌军的前面，早已有一条光明的道路，这就是潘朔端将军的道路，勇敢坚决的站在人民方面来，高举起反对卖国内战独裁的旗帜，这就是以潘朔端将军为首的民主同盟军。
