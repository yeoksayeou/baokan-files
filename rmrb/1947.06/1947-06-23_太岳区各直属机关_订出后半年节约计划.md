[This newspaper Taiyue 21st dispatch] All directly subordinate organs in this district have examined their production and economy achievements over the past four to five months and formulated plans for economy in the latter half of the year. It is reported that: starting from July 1st, the district Party committee organs, in addition to receiving grain as usual, will economize on part of their clothing expenses and completely economize on other miscellaneous expenses and subsidies, saving a total of 1,778,800 yuan in half a year. In terms of individual production, 66 people have produced 150,000 yuan in the two, three, four, and five months, and individual savings amounted to 115,230 yuan. The administrative office, in addition to receiving clothing and grain, will economize on everything else, saving 600,000 yuan in the latter half of the year. Private production, excluding agricultural production such as raising pigs and chickens, has already produced more than 100,000 yuan. The Finance and Economics Office will be self-sufficient in part or in whole, except for grain, saving more than 170,000 yuan in total. Individual production in March, April, and May amounted to 85,300 yuan, and private savings on clothing and shoes amounted to 200,000 yuan. The Public Security Bureau can save 60,000 yuan per month in the latter half of the year, excluding clothing and grain, saving a total of 360,000 yuan. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily will economize on all expenses except for clothing and grain, saving more than 680,000 yuan in the latter half of the year. The Jinnan Bank District Branch also plans to save more than 140,000 yuan. It is estimated that the above six organs can save more than 3,730,000 yuan in the latter half of the year. In terms of individual production and savings, many comrades have realized the principle of "individual difficulties, individual solutions." For example, the director of the secretariat of the District Bank will save 23,566 yuan in the latter half of the year by economizing on clothing, food expenses, subsidies, and grain for his baby. Many models of production and savings have emerged in various organs. For example, Wu Ruilin, a cook at the Joint Bureau of Industry and Commerce Taxation, has earned 12,000 yuan just from carrying charcoal. Le Yuhuo, a cook at the Finance and Economics Office, has earned 9,700 yuan from carrying charcoal, sprouting soybeans, and feeding pigs. Three comrades from the telecommunications section of the Taiyue Xinhua Daily have each earned 9,000 yuan just from printing elementary school textbooks. According to estimates by the secretariat of the newspaper, each person can produce an average of 10,000 yuan by the end of the year. In May, many people had already paid their annual production quota of 2,000 yuan in advance. Currently, the District Party Committee is calling on everyone to plant ten pumpkin seedlings to prepare for famine, and most organs have completed this task.
[This newspaper Taihang dispatch] In response to the call, the Second Special District Office's Production Committee held a plenary meeting of organs to discuss organ savings. It was decided to reduce the consumption of white flour by five meals per month (originally fifteen meals), reduce the consumption of oil by one qian (approximately 0.11 ounces) per person per day (originally six qian), and reduce the consumption of salt by one qian (originally six qian), saving two liang (approximately 2.47 ounces) of rice.
