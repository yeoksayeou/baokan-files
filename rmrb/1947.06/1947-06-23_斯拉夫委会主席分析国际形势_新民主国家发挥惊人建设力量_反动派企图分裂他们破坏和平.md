　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS Warsaw dispatch: At the Second Plenary Session of the All-Slavic Committee, Chairman Masaryk analyzed the international situation in his speech, pointing out two characteristics: First, the Slavic countries liberated by the Soviet army from the German fascist occupiers, under the leadership of democratic governments, have displayed astonishing construction efforts. Second, reactionaries are attempting to oppress these countries, split the unity of the Slavic nations, and secretly undermine peace. Masaryk continued: However, the democratic leaders of the Slavic countries are exposing the fascist warmongers and the usurpers of new world hegemony. At the same time, in various non-Slavic nations, including the United States, Latin America, and Australia, there are approximately 360 Slavic organizations that firmly defend peace and democracy. Therefore, they are also subjected to vicious attacks by reactionaries in various countries. Masaryk pointed out: It is not accidental that reactionaries in various countries attack the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union suffered enormous sacrifices in the anti-fascist war that liberated us, and it is now the most promising pillar of democratic countries in the world, especially Slavic countries. The Slavic Committee must launch a relentless and uncompromising struggle against reactionary fascists. Because without the anti-fascist struggle, there will be no real struggle for democracy. Now the people of all democratic countries have been called upon to restore economic stability, consolidate democracy, and their own freedom and independence. This is the most powerful blow to the warmongers and the most reliable investment in democratic development.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Comprehensive report: The Second Plenary Session of the All-Slavic Committee was held on the 16th at the Warsaw Army Sports Field. When the delegations from the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland appeared on the stage, applause thundered, and the crowd cheered: "Long live Stalin, the friend of the Polish people!" "Long live Marshal Tito!" "Long live Dimitrov!" At the opening of the conference, the chairman of the Polish-Soviet Friendship Association delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "The Slavic movement is completely democratic and progressive, and it has become an international anti-fascist movement." The conference will discuss the brotherly cooperation between the Slavic peoples and promote the consolidation of peace. One of the most important tasks of the committee this year is to prepare for the Second Slavic Conference and hold a Slavic Scientists Conference, publish popular pamphlets about Slavic countries, and commemorate the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution, the 800th anniversary of Moscow, the 600th anniversary of Prague University (the previous telegram mistakenly stated 6th anniversary), and the 1000th anniversary of the Slavic alphabet.

　　斯拉夫委会主席分析国际形势
    新民主国家发挥惊人建设力量
    反动派企图分裂他们破坏和平
    民主国家起来巩固自由独立
    是对战争贩子最有力的打击
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社华沙讯：全斯拉夫委员会主席马斯莱里克在第二届全体大会上发言分析国际形势时，指出两个特点：第一、被苏军从德国法西斯占领者解放出来的斯拉夫各国，在民主政府的领导下，发挥了惊人的建设的努力。第二、反动派则企图压迫这些国家，分裂斯拉夫民族的团结，并暗中破坏和平。马氏继称：但是斯拉夫各国的民主领袖正在揭露法西斯的战争贩子们和新世界霸权的窃取者。同时在各个非斯拉夫民族的国家里，包括美国、拉丁美洲及澳大利亚在内，约有三百六十个斯拉夫团体，他们坚决的保卫和平与民主。因此，也遭受各国反动派恶毒的攻击。马氏指出：各国反动派攻击苏联不是偶然的，苏联在解放我们的反法西斯战争中蒙受了巨大的牺牲，而且现在又是世界民主国家特别是斯拉夫国家最有指望的支柱，斯拉夫委员会必须对反动的法西斯分子展开无情的与不妥协的斗争。因为如果没有反法西斯的斗争，就不会有真正为民主的斗争。现在各民主国家的人民已被召唤起来恢复经济稳定，巩固民主和他们自己的自由与独立。这是对战争贩子们的一个最有力的打击，也是在民主发展中一笔最可靠的投资。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合报导：全斯拉夫委员会第二届全体大会，于十六日在华沙陆军运动场上举行。当苏、南、保、捷、波等国代表团出现于台上时，掌声雷动，万众欢呼：“波兰人民的朋友斯大林万岁！”“铁托元帅万岁！”“季米特洛夫万岁！”大会开幕时由波苏友好协会主席致欢迎词称：“斯拉夫运动是完全民主和进步的，它已成为国际反法西斯的运动了。”大会将讨论斯拉夫人民间兄弟般的合作，并促成和平的巩固。委员会今年最重要的工作之一为筹备第二届斯拉夫会议及举行斯拉夫科学家会议，出版有关斯拉夫国家的通俗小册子，并将纪念十月革命三十周年、莫斯科八百周年、布拉格大学六百周年（前电误为六周年）、斯拉夫字母一千周年等纪念日。
