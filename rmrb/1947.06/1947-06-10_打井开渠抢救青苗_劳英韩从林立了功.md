　　Digging Wells and Opening Channels to Save Seedlings
    Labor Hero Han Conglin Makes Contributions
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 8th] The Yangcheng County Production Committee recently awarded two "Drought Prevention Pioneer" silver medals and two certificates of merit to Labor Hero Han Conglin, chairman of the Farmers' Association Ma Baoshun, and their mutual aid group from Songbi Village. Han Conglin was also given a major commendation. The village planted early and successfully caught the seedlings, but due to drought and lack of rain, the seedlings withered. Han Conglin and Ma Baoshun proposed the slogan of fighting drought and preparing for famine, which most people agreed with. However, some people, such as Wu Fengguan and Zhang Heyi, wanted to abandon agricultural production and engage in transportation. Han Conglin reasoned with them, saying, "Grain is fundamental. What will we eat if we don't farm? If we dig more wells and irrigate more land, we will harvest hundreds more catties of cotton. What if we delay the crops by engaging in transportation?" Wu Fengguan and Zhang Heyi thought it over and understood the reasoning. The next day, the villagers acted under the slogan of "Saving a seedling is like managing a seedling" to fight against the drought. Over nine hundred men and women, both full and part-time laborers, divided up to dig canals, dig wells, and water seedlings. Wu Yinke's group used sixteen workdays to open the Beiwan Canal, and Han Jinsheng's group used twelve workdays to open the Nanwan Canal. These two canals can irrigate more than eighty acres of land. Han Conglin led the mutual aid group to dredge two old wells and dig a new well in twenty-six workdays. After the canals and wells were completed, Conglin led the villagers to carry water to irrigate the seedlings. Men carried water, women dug pits and covered the soil, and children scooped water to water the seedlings. At noon, all the laborers concentrated on weeding the seedlings. Through this intense labor, they saved 485 and 1/3 acres of cotton seedlings and 185 acres of hemp, totaling over 600 acres.
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 9th] Tounliu Xiliuzhai Labor Hero Li Guiyuan led the masses to open ten canals, saving 1,000 acres of seedlings. His leadership in canal construction started with a squad from the mutual aid brigade, first opening a one-mile-long canal. Seeing that the seedlings irrigated by the canal grew well, the first squad of the village also opened a one-and-a-half-mile canal, using only 186 workdays. Seeing the great benefits of opening canals and irrigating the land, all four squads mobilized and opened five miles in one day, using 632 workdays, irrigating over 400 acres. Subsequently, the masses in each village opened canals one after another, forming a movement. As of now, a total of ten canals have been completed, irrigating more than 1,000 acres of land, and the seedlings have not only been saved from drought but have also grown into a lush green.
    [Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 8th] Qize Qiaotun Village Labor Model Qiao Zanyu borrows wells to plant. During the day, those with wells are irrigating their fields, so he borrows wells at night to irrigate his fields. Taking advantage of the moonlight, he irrigated for three nights with two windlasses, irrigating a total of 3.6 acres, and has now planted cotton. Yu Xinniang and Yu Xin carried water to plant cotton, planting two acres in two days. Seeing that they could plant cotton even without a well, others broke the idea of relying on the heavens for rain, and the number of people borrowing wells at night and carrying water to plant cotton is gradually increasing.

　　打井开渠抢救青苗
    劳英韩从林立了功
    【本报太岳八日电】阳城县生产委员会顷以“防旱先锋”银章两个，奖状两纸奖予宋壁村劳动英雄韩从林，农会主席马保顺及其互助组，韩从林并记大功一次。该村提早下种，均捉住了苗，但因天旱不雨禾苗干枯，韩从林、马保顺便提出抗旱备荒的号召，大多数人都表示同意。但有吴风管、张河义等要放弃农业生产搞运输，韩从林便和他算账说：“粮食是根本，不种地吃什么？我们多打几眼井，多浇几亩地，就多收几百斤花，如果搞运输误了庄稼怎样办？”吴风管、张河义左思右想，想通了这个道理。第二天全村群众都在“救活一苗管一苗”的口号下行动起来，与天旱作斗争，全村九百余个男女全半劳力，分头开渠、打井、浇苗，吴银科组以十六个工开成北湾渠，韩金生组以十二个工开成南湾渠，这两条渠共可浇八十多亩地，韩从林领导的互助组以二十六个工掏了两眼旧井，打成一眼新井。开渠打井完成后从林便领导全村群众挑水浇苗，男人担水、妇女刨坑、盖土，小孩舀水浇苗，正晌午全体劳力集中锄苗，在这样紧张的劳动中救活了棉苗四百八十五亩三分、麻一百八十五亩，共计六百余亩。
    【本报太岳九日电】屯留西柳寨劳动英雄李桂元领导群众开渠十条，救活禾苗一千亩。他对修渠的领导，是从互助大队中的一分队下手，先开了一条一里长的渠。本村一分队看到渠水浇了的禾苗长的又好又齐全，便也开了一里半的一条，只用工一百八十六个。群众看见开渠浇地利益大，于是四个分队都动员起来，一天就开了五里，用工六百三十二个。浇地四百余亩。随后各庄群众都纷纷开渠，形成运动，截至目前共完成十条水渠，浇地千余亩，禾苗不仅免于旱死，且已长得一片碧绿。
    【本报冀南八日电】鸡泽乔屯庄劳动模范乔瓒玉，借井点种。白天有井的都在浇田，他就夜间借井浇田，趁着月光两架辘轳浇了三夜，共浇三亩六分，现已点上棉花。玉心娘和玉心抬水点棉，两天点种二亩，别人见他们没井也能种上棉花，打破了靠天等雨思想，黑夜借井、挑水点花的日渐增多了。
