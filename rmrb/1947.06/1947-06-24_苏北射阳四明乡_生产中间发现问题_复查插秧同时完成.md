Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th—In Siyang Township (new county), Sheyang County, Subei Province, the review was combined with production, and the township-wide review and rice transplanting were completed simultaneously. Aiming at the past contradiction of "the masses want production, the cadres want to hold meetings," the township cadres in all 506 households. In the 22 rice transplanting mutual aid teams, one or two village cadres and activists were added to each team, leading rice transplanting during the day, casually discussing who got more land and who contributed less land during the land reform, in order to discover problems. For example, Sun Jingji and two other families in Minghua Village over-reported their population and concealed 13 mu of land before and after. That night, while the iron was hot, the rice transplanting mutual aid team was transformed into a village meeting, where the masses democratically discussed solutions, while the township cadres reviewed by village and reported and supervised every night, so that complex problems could be quickly completed. At the same time, the mutual aid team had a lot of manpower and quickly transplanted more than 600 mu of rice in three days. Now all the rice seedlings in the township have been transplanted in a timely manner.

　　苏北射阳四明乡
    生产中间发现问题
    复查插秧同时完成
    【新华社华中十八日电】苏北射阳（新县）四明乡复查与生产结合，全乡复查和插秧同时完成。该乡干部针对过去“群众要生产，干部要开会”的矛盾在全乡五○六户。二二个插秧互助队中，每队加入一、二个村干和积极分子，白天领导插秧，漫谈土地改革中谁得田多，谁出田少，以发现问题。如明华村孙敬吉等二家多报人口，前后瞒田十三亩。当晚趁热打铁，把插秧互助队一变而为村民会，由群众民主讨论解决办法，乡干则分村检讨，每晚检报督促，复杂得以迅速完成。同时互助队人多手快，三天即插秧六百余亩，现全乡秧苗均已及时插毕。
