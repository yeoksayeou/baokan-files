Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 11th: Washington dispatch: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Braden, a representative of those within the U.S. State Department who oppose military alliances with other countries and the “Americanization” of Latin American armaments, resigned on the 4th. It is reported that the direct reason for Braden's resignation was dissatisfaction with the United States and Argentina's plan to discuss and conclude a Pan-American "defense" treaty at a future Pan-American conference. Braden had argued that the Argentine government should not participate in any defense treaty until it had completely expelled all Nazi forces from its territory. Wallace commented on this event, saying: This is further evidence that the United States is prepared to cooperate with any reactionary in the world.

    【新华社陕北十一日电】华盛顿讯：美国务院中反对美国与其他国家军事联合及拉丁美洲军备“美国化”的人士之代表，美助理国务卿布拉登已于四日辞职。布氏辞职之直接原因闻系不满意美国与阿根廷预定于未来之泛美洲会议中，将商谈总结泛美“防务”条约，布氏曾主张阿根廷政府未将纳粹全部势力逐出其国土以前，不得参加任何防务条约。华莱士对此一事件评论称：此乃美国准备与世界任何反动者合作之另一明证。
