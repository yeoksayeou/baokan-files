　　Guerrilla Captain Tian Qiyuan
    Wen Jie
    Whether judging from his robust physique or his glorious history, Tian Qiyuan can be called a first-rate hero. He joined the Shaanxi-Gansu Red Army at the age of thirteen, fought in numerous eastern and western campaigns, was gloriously wounded in the famous Battle of Laoshan in northern Shaanxi, and was promoted to platoon leader. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, he followed the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army in battles across the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region, participated in the world-renowned Hundred Regiments Offensive, and was promoted to company commander. In 1944, he was demobilized and returned to his hometown due to injuries and participated in local work. In March of this year, when the enemy sneaked into the territory of Ansai County, he took up his familiar gun again and organized the Yunping Guerrilla Force to fight the enemy.

    I saw Tian Qiyuan on the front lines. His injury had not fully healed, and his right arm was in a sling. He was waving his left arm, giving political mobilization to his guerrillas, preparing to block the enemy who was fleeing eastward from Gaoqiao tonight. Hu Yongqing, secretary of the CCP District Committee, pointed to his tall figure and praised to me: "What a hero! He refuses to rest even when injured, and only temporarily left the team when ordered by his superiors. Now that his injury has not fully recovered, he is clamoring to return to the team."

    After a while, Tian Qiyuan came in. This heroic man looked at my eyes and smiled and said, "Are you talking about my injury behind my back again? It's not that I don't want to rest, it's that the enemy won't let me rest." He took his right hand from the sling and shook hands with me vigorously, as if to say, "Comrade, my injury is healed. Look at the strength of my hand."

    The story of how Tian Qiyuan injured his right hand became the topic of our meeting. He said: "The enemy occupied Hezhuangping and often came out in groups of ten or eight to rob grain. After I found out the situation, I led seven team members to ambush at Jianshan Village, preparing to give the enemy a head-on blow. Who knew that the situation suddenly changed that day, and the enemy dispatched more than one hundred and fifty people, searching and climbing up the mountain. If we didn't block them, the enemy would quickly climb to the top of the mountain, and we would have no way to retreat. So I immediately decided to 'fight', but I was afraid that the first shot would miss and be laughed at by the enemy. I ordered that no one was allowed to shoot before I did. When the enemy was one hundred and fifty meters away from the village, my gun fired, and the enemy's vanguard fell down and never moved. Team member Meng Desheng followed with a shot, and the second person rolled down the mountain. The enemy's formation immediately became chaotic, crawling on the edges of the fields and in the ditches, firing their machine guns randomly without any target. We took advantage of the enemy's confusion and began to retreat. At this moment, my right arm was hit by enemy shrapnel. The enemy sacrificed two people and wasted thousands of bullets, and didn't dare to enter the village until dark." (Xinhua News Agency Northwest, 9th)

　　游击队长田启元
    闻捷
    无论从他那魁伟的外形，或者光辉的历史来看，田启元都称得上是个顶天立地的好汉。他十三岁就参加陕北红军，曾经东征西战，在赫赫有名的陕北劳山战斗中，光荣负伤，并升为排长。抗战后，随八路军一一五师转战冀鲁豫，参加过震动中外的百团大战，又升连长。四四年因负伤复员回乡，参加了地方工作。今年三月，当敌人窜抵安塞县境时，他又重新拿起曾经用惯了的枪，组织起一支云坪游击队，和敌人进行战斗。
    在边缘线上，我看见了田启元。他的伤还未全好，右臂吊在绷带上，挥舞着左臂，在向他的游击队员们进行政治动员。准备今夜去阻击从高桥东窜的敌人。中共区委书记胡永清指着他那高大的背影对我赞扬地说：“好汉子！带了彩都不肯休养，直到上级强令他休养时才暂时离开了队伍。如今伤还没有全好过，又闹着回到队伍上来了。”
    一会田启元进来了，这豪侠的汉子瞅着我的眼睛笑哈哈地说：“又在背后议论我的伤啦，不是我不愿休养，是敌人不让我休养啊。”他把右手从绷带上取出，用力的和我紧紧握手，似乎在表示：“同志，我的伤好了。你看我这手劲。”
    田启元右手受伤的经过，成了我们这次见面的话题。是他说：“敌人占了河庄坪，经常十个八个的出来抢粮。我侦察明白情况后，就带领了七个队员埋伏在尖山寨子，准备给敌人一个迎头痛击。谁知那天情况突然变了，敌出动了一百五十多人，搜索着爬上山来。当时如果不阻击一下，敌人会很快的爬到山顶，我们就没法转移了。于是我立即决定“打”，可又怕第一枪落空叫敌人笑话，我命令在我没有打枪前，谁也不准打枪。在敌人距离寨子一百五十米时，我的枪响了，敌人的尖兵倒下去再也没动。队员孟得胜跟着一枪，第二个人就滚下山去了。敌人的阵容立即混乱，爬在地畔上沟渠里，没有目标的乱打起机枪来。我们就趁敌人混乱，开始转移。就在这时，我的右胳膊中了敌人的流弹。敌人呢，牺牲了两个人，浪费了几千发子弹，一直打到天黑连寨子都没有敢进。”（新华社西北九日电）
