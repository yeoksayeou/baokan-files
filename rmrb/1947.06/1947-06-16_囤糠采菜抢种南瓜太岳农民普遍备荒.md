　　【Taiyue, 14th (Our Newspaper)】The movement to conserve and prepare for famine is deeply rooted in the countryside. Private sugar and wine workshops in the fifth district of Jincheng voluntarily switched industries at the beginning of this month. Many villages are rush-planting an average of ten pumpkin seedlings per person, collecting ten jin of wild vegetables, and saving one he of rice per day. Village cadres also regard leading the masses in conserving and preparing for famine as one of the criteria for meritorious service. Village Chief Hou Jiang said, "Recalling the scene of people starving to death three years ago due to disaster, we dare not waste a single grain of rice. In the future, the bean cakes from the oil mills must be accumulated." The masses in Shimin Jiaofang Village proposed, "Rather eat half a meal than miss a meal altogether." Every household has set up a conservation plan. The masses in Sanlü stipulated that they would eat dumplings in the morning, mix two sheng of bran into every dou of corn, change the noon meal from boiled rice to mixed grain rice, and add more wild vegetables to the mixed grain rice in the evening. In this way, each person can save two and a half he per day, and seven and a half sheng per month. The whole lü, 137 people, can save a total of ten shi of millet. The Liu Jinrong mutual aid team in Dongjiashan Village organizes the masses to collect wild vegetables, accumulate grain in the community granary, and mix three sheng of bran into every dou of corn, saving three he of rice per person. Yangcheng universally proposed the slogan of "A small stream flows long, long-term planning." The masses in Zhangxun Village, from May 2nd, all 324 households in the village saved two he of millet per person per day, which can save 83 shi, 2 dou, and 2 sheng in a month. At the same time, they are preparing to hoard 1,300 shi of bran and collect 20,500 jin of wild vegetables. According to the village cadres, even if the autumn harvest is poor, they can maintain the situation next year and avoid a spring famine. Seventy percent of Shangkongzhai Village are iron furnace workers. Because the workers get up early, they eat before going to work, so the whole village eats four meals a day regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Since the government called for conserving and preparing for famine, they have changed to three meals a day. In this way, the entire village of 509 people can save an average of one shi and seven and a half dou of millet per day. From the 2nd of this month, the entire village of 2,270 people in Zhongye Village will save 87 shi and 6 dou of millet, collect 11,350 jin of wild vegetables, and accumulate 22,700 jin of bran flour throughout the year, aiming to make bran and vegetables half of their food supply. The Zhang Kuangming mutual aid team in Zhangma Village, Qinshui, has always been "preventing drought every year." Since there was a lack of rain in the spring, all team members were prepared early. Currently, they have dried 1,500 jin of vegetables and continue to organize the collection of wild vegetables. It is estimated that this year's wild vegetables can provide the entire village population with enough food to survive the famine for two months.

　　囤糠采菜抢种南瓜太岳农民普遍备荒
    【本报太岳十四日电】节约备荒运动深入农村。晋城五区民营糖坊、酒坊皆于本月初自动转业，许多村庄平均每人抢种十苗南瓜，采集十斤野菜，每天省一合米。村干部亦以领导群众节约备荒为立功标准之一，侯匠村长说：“回忆三年前遭灾饿死人的情景，一粒米也不敢浪费，今后油坊里的豆饼一定要积蓄下来”。士敏教坊村群众提出：“宁吃半顿，不吃断顿”，每户都订出了节约计划，三闾群众规定早上吃疙瘩，每斗玉茭里掺二升糠，中午捞饭改为和子饭，晚上和子饭多加野菜，这样，每人每日可节约二合五，每月可节约七升五合，全闾一百三十七人，共可节约十石小米。董家山刘金荣互助大队组织群众采野菜，积义仓，吃玉茭每斗掺三升糠，每人节约三合米。阳城普遍提出：“细水长流、长期打算”的口号，章训村群众，从五月二日起，全村三百二十四户，每人每日节约小米二合，一月可节约八十三石二斗二升，同时准备囤糠一千三百石，集野菜两万零五百斤，据该村干部估计：今秋歉收明年亦可维持不发生春荒。上孔寨村十分之七是铁炉工人，因工人早起，先吃饭然后上工，所以全村不论春夏秋冬照例吃四顿饭，自政府号召节约备荒以来，已改为三顿饭，如此全村五百○九口人，平均每天即可节约小米一石七斗五升。中冶村由本月二日开始，全村二千二百七十口人，全年要节约小米八十七石六斗、采野菜一万一千三百五十斤、集糠面二万二千七百斤，作到糠菜半年粮。沁水张马村张况铭互助大队一向是“年年防旱”，入春缺雨，全队队员早有准备。目前已晒干菜一千五百斤，并继续组织采野菜，估计今年野菜可供全村人口渡荒两个月。
