　　Model Postman Universally Admired
    [Report from our newspaper in Jiaozuo] Comrade Ding Baoshun, a postman in Jiaozuo, is responsible in his work and universally admired. Jiaozuo County has three districts, agencies, and troops, with one county line to district lines, a round trip of eighty li. The established staffing is two postmen. In April, one postman was injured by a landmine while delivering mail. He insisted on doing the work of two people alone, running the route for eight consecutive days. He would get up at eight in the morning and return by one in the afternoon, without any complaints, and he never lost a single piece of mail. When encountering enemy situations, and when agencies relocated and lost contact, he was still able to find ways to complete his tasks and protect the safety of the mail. In the latter half of May, he continued to persist in his work alone. In fifteen days, he ran the eighty-li route seven times and the thirty-li route eight times, without a single day of rest at home. In addition to his work, in mid-May, he also took the time to cut firewood fifteen times, totaling 882 jin. Based on the above deeds, the Bureau of Administration awarded him a Second Class Merit in April. In May, the employee group suggested that he should be awarded a First Class Merit twice and a Third Class Merit once. The Fourth District Postal Office commended him in a circular and awarded him the honorary title of "Model Postman."

　　模范邮工人人敬爱
    【本报焦作讯】焦作邮工丁宝顺同志，工作负责，人人敬爱。焦作全县有三个区，机关和部队，有一条县线到区线，来回八十里，编制上有两个邮工，四月份一个邮工送信被地雷炸伤，他一人坚持了两人工作，连跑八天，上午八点起身，下午一点就返回来了，未有任何怨言，亦未丢过一件信；遇有敌情，机关转移失去连络时，他仍能设法完成任务，并保护邮件安全。五月后半月他仍一人坚持工作，在十五天中他共跑八十里路七次，三十里路八次，没有一天在家休息。除工作以外，五月中他还抽时割了十五次柴，共割八百八十二斤，根据以上事迹，四月份管理局给他记了二等功一次，五月份职工小组意见，应记一等功两次、三等功一次。四分区邮政办事处曾通报表扬，并给予“模范邮工”光荣称号。
