　　Lu Jiayin Squad Competes in Weeding
　　Li Shengzhuang in Qiu County Starts Early and Works Late in a Crash Weeding Campaign
　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 12th dispatch] The Lu Jiayin Seventh Squad of the Shangguan United Brigade in Yangcheng County weeded 375 mu of seedlings in six days, doubling the speed. The village has 61 households, with 44 male and female laborers. 13 people are supporting the front lines, leaving each person to weed 13 mu of seedlings. However, due to being organized, they completed the crash weeding in six days. Based on this experience, the entire village plans to weed the autumn seedlings three times for millet, twice for corn, and seven times for cotton, which can be completed in just one month. The reason for this is firstly, there must be sufficient preparation before weeding. After sowing, women rushed to make single-layer clothes, shoes, grind flour, and mill rice. Men took care of all odd jobs. Once weeding started, everyone went to the fields. Secondly, there was sufficient ideological mobilization. After the rain on the 23rd of last month, women's meetings, elderly men's meetings, and children's meetings were held one after another to mobilize everyone, making them aware of the labor shortage and the saying that "weeding millet by an inch is as good as applying fertilizer." After the 28th, each group set out a plan: Group one guaranteed to complete 126.4 mu of millet and 19 mu of cotton in six days; Group two to complete 83.3 mu of millet and 16 mu of cotton in seven days; Group three to complete 76 mu of millet and 12.6 mu of cotton in six days. The elderly men's group, due to old age and stiff legs, could not squat down, so they only weeded cotton. The other 17 men were assigned to each group to help women record work points and calculate accounts. There were also four men replanting, and 27 women and children looking after children, feeding silkworms, and cooking. There was no idle person in the entire village. Thirdly, the entire team launched a weeding competition, improving labor efficiency. Their slogan was "Everyone strives to be a hero, everyone acts as a model." Everyone said: "If Bai Ru can be reported, why can't we be reported?" Military dependent Wang Yueying guaranteed at the meeting that she would be self-sufficient in labor and save preferential treatment work tickets, setting an example for the entire village. First, she proposed weeding quickly and thoroughly, leaving no grass on the ground. Lu Tianrui, a child of only 13 years old, also proposed weeding like everyone else. At the summary on the night of June 5th, it was found that weeding the first time had used a total of 389 workdays, averaging 7.3 fen per workday. Military dependent Wang Yueying was selected as the first model. She averaged two fen of extra work each day. In addition to finishing her own 2.7 mu, she also sold 32.1 fen of work tickets. By implementing mutual assistance and exchanging labor, preferential treatment work tickets were saved. Women like Lu Xiaoduo were also selected as models. Old men Lu Heming, 66, and Lu Hewen also worked alongside young people and were selected as models. Lu Tielian, Lu Tianrui, and others, aged 15, worked the same as full laborers, earning a full day's work each day. Lu Guantie, 11, who could cook five families' meals every day, also became a model. The team is now rectifying and consolidating its organization, preparing for the second weeding.
    [This newspaper, Southern Hebei, 12th dispatch] Li Yan'an, a labor hero from Li Shengzhuang in Qiu County, convened a meeting of group leaders and production committee members on May 22nd to specifically study weeding, deciding to weed the 11.8 hectares of cotton and sorghum first. With the current 128 full laborers, each person weeding 3 mu per day, it could all be weeded in three days. To ensure completion on schedule, each group launched a challenge, with the conditions being: 1. Stop all odd jobs and repairing houses, weed less seedlings, and weed more grass. 2. All group members get up early, and are consistent in the morning and afternoon. 3. Weed cleanly, and each group selects a standard person, so that everyone weeds like them. After weeding once, model groups and model people are elected, and merits are evaluated. In Wang Daozhai in Nanguan First District, military dependents accounted for 152 out of the entire village's 750 households. In addition to 27 self-cultivating households, the remaining military dependents cultivated 6.6 hectares of land on their behalf, plus 2.68 hectares of land cultivated on behalf of stretcher bearers, totaling 9.28 hectares. The entire village had only 215 full laborers, and the labor burden on the masses was very heavy. Currently, with the weeding task at hand, after enlightenment, deliberation, and discussion, a women's cultivation team of 409 people was organized, and a temporary production assault committee was formed by Meng Baoyi and six others. Niu Weiguang from the district women's association also personally went to the fields to lead, helping everyone stipulate that in the morning, they would collectively weed for military dependents and stretcher bearers, and in the morning and afternoon, they would weed their own seedlings. In five days, all 150+ mu of sorghum and cotton belonging to military dependents and stretcher bearers were completely weeded.

　　个个争英雄人人当模范
    卢家殷分队竞赛锄苗
    邱县李省庄起早搭黑突击锄苗
    【本报太岳十二日电】阳城上官中有联合大队卢家殷七分队六天锄苗三百七十五亩，速度提高一倍。该庄共六十一户，四十四个男女劳力，支援前线十三人，其余每人须锄十三亩苗。但因组织起来，六天便突击锄完。根据此一经验，全庄秋苗预计谷子锄三遍，玉茭锄两遍，棉花锄七遍，仅用一月时间即可完成。其原因首先是锄苗前要有充分准备工作。妇女在下种之后即赶做单衣，鞋子，磨面、碾米，男人做好一切零活，一待锄苗开始，全部上地。其次是有充分思想动员。上月二十三日落雨后，即先后召开妇女会、老汉会、儿童会、进行动员，使大家都认识劳力缺乏和“谷锄一寸顶住上粪”的道理，二十八日以后，各组都订出了计划：一组保证六天完成一百二十六亩四分谷，十九亩棉花；二组七天完成八十三亩三分谷，十六亩棉花，三组六天完成七十六亩谷，十二亩六分棉花。老汉组因年老腿硬，不能蹲下，只锄棉花。其他十七个男人配备到各组帮助妇女记工，算账。并有四个男人补种，二十七个妇女儿童看小孩，喂蚕，做饭。全村无一闲人。第三，全队展开锄苗立功大竞赛，提高了劳动效率。其口号是“个个争英雄，人人当模范”。大家都说：“白如赛能上报，咱就不能上报？”军属王月英在大会上保证自己劳力自给，节省优待工票，为全庄人立功。先是提出锄的人而且快，地上不留一根草。儿童卢天瑞才十三岁，亦提出与大家一样锄苗。六月五日夜总结，锄第一遍苗共用工三百八十九个，平均每工锄七分三厘。军属王月英被选为第一模范。她每天平均比别人多做两分工。除将自己的二亩七分锄完外，并卖工票三十二分一厘。实行互助变工，节省了优待工票。妇女卢小多等也都当选为模范。六十六岁的老汉卢和明与卢和文亦与青年人并肩劳动，当选为模范。十五岁的卢铁炼、卢天瑞等与全劳力一样的劳动，每天顶全工。十一岁的卢管铁每天能做五家饭，均成为模范。现该队正在整顿巩固组织，准备锄二遍。
    【本报冀南十二日电】邱县李省庄劳英李兖安于五月二十二日召开小组长及生产委员会议，专门研究锄苗，决定先把十一顷八十亩棉花、高粱锄起来，按现有一百二十八个整劳力，每人每天锄三亩，三天可全部锄完，为保证按期锄完，各组掀起挑战，条件为一、停止一切零活及修房盖屋，少开苗多锄草。二、全组人员起的早，上晌下晌一致。三、锄的干净，每组选出一标准人，他锄啥样都是啥样。锄完一遍后选举模范组、模范人，评定功劳。南官一区王道寨全村七百五十户中军属占一百五十二户，除二十七户自耕外，其余军属代耕土地有六顷六十亩，再加出担架代耕地二顷六十八亩，共九顷二十八亩，全村全劳力仅有二百一十五个，群众劳力负担很重，目前锄苗任务到来，经启发、酝酿、讨论，组织了四百零九人的妇女代耕队，由孟保义等七人组织成临时生产突击会，区妇会牛伟光也亲自下地领导，帮助大家规定了早晨给军属、担架员集体锄苗，上午下午锄自己的苗，历时五天，全数军属及担架员的一百五十余亩高粱、棉花全部锄完。
