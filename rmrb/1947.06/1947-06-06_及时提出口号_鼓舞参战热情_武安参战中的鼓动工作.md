　　Promptly Propose Slogans
    Inspire Enthusiasm for Participation in the War
    Mobilization Work in Wu'an's Participation in the War
    [This newspaper Wu'an News] During this militia stretcher-bearer participation in the war, propaganda slogans were promptly proposed according to the emotions of the participants, which had a great educational effect. For example, when arriving at Lundang Village in Anyang, there was a phenomenon of eating and drinking extravagantly, so the following slogans were proposed: "Fried dough sticks are delicious, but waste is serious; rather go half a meal than run out of meals," which reduced waste. When chopping firewood at the station, everyone proposed that "chopping firewood saves money for ourselves, and it's glorious to be praised in the newspaper." For members of the farmers' association, it was proposed: "Those who have turned over are heroes, and those who participate in the war must be the backbone; attack Zhangde Prefecture and capture the big landlords; attack Anyang County and capture the big bad guys." The militia in the Second District proposed: "Unity is strength, and no difficulty is to be feared; as long as we are determined, there is no difficulty in participating in the war," and launched a campaign to earn merit. The Seventh District proposed: "Whether or not one earns merit lies in overcoming difficulties; merit comes from hardship, and labor comes from hardship; take the lead in enduring hardship, sweating more, and earning more merit." Workers at the coal kiln in the Tenth District proposed when digging fortifications: "Digging fortifications is digging up the roots of evil, opening up Anyang to eliminate the roots of harm," because many of the big landlords in the Tenth District were in the city. In order to draw on the war to help the masses produce labor, it was proposed: "Everyone should be thrifty, everyone should produce." When the masses in the new district had difficulties in production, the county headquarters called on them to help plant flowers and launched a campaign of half a mu of land per person, and the Seventh District proposed: "Those who suffer should love those who suffer; people are here, feelings are here; when people leave, cotton will bloom." Before the evaluation of merit, some people were not active, thinking that honest people were taken advantage of. To educate these people, it was proposed: "Whoever is slippery won't do, whoever is honest will be credited." During the evaluation of merit, in order to make everyone's evaluation real, it was proposed: "Merit must be reported, no merit must not be boasted, and everyone must tell the truth." (Zhen Bang)

　　及时提出口号
    鼓舞参战热情
    武安参战中的鼓动工作
    【本报武安讯】这次民兵担架参战中，根据参战人员情绪，及时提出宣传鼓动口号，教育作用很大。如到安阳伦当村时有的大吃二喝发生浪费现象，即提出：油条好吃，浪费严重，宁叫半顿不叫断顿等口号，减少了浪费。在驻地打柴，大家提出打柴省钱为自己，登报表扬多光荣。对农会会员提出：翻身是好汉，参战要起骨干；打进彰德府，捉回大地主；打进安阳县，捉回大坏蛋。二区民兵提出：团结起来力量大，任何困难都不怕；只要坚决干，参战没困难，开展了立功运动。七区提出：立功不立功，但在困难中；功从苦中来，劳从苦中生；吃苦带头流汗多立功。十区煤窑工人挖工事提出：挖工事是挖坏根，打开安阳除害根；因十区不少大地主，都在城里。为了抽战争空隙帮助群众生产劳力，即提出：人人要节约，人人要生产。新区群众生产有困难，县指挥部号召帮助种花开展每人半亩地运动，七区即提出：受苦人要爱受苦人，人在人情在，人走棉花开。在未评功时有些人不积极，认为别人老实是被捉了大头，为教育这些人，提出：谁滑头谁不行，谁实受谁立功。评功时为了使大家评的真实，提出：有功不可不报，没功不可自夸，都要说直话。（振邦）
