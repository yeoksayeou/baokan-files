(By our newspaper from Taiyue, 31st) The Taiyue District Party Committee issued a call for production, thrift, drought prevention, and famine preparedness. (1) Currently, there is a general lack of rain in all parts of the district, and drought has already formed, with the second, third, and fourth sub-districts being the most severely affected. Although it has rained in some places, the rainfall is insufficient, resulting in a general reduction in wheat harvests. In many places, autumn seedlings have not yet been sown, or the seedlings have not emerged fully after sowing. In some areas, this has also affected grain prices. In order to solve the needs of the military and the people and effectively overcome financial difficulties, we must make the greatest efforts and the greatest persistence to do a good job in production, thrift, drought prevention, and famine preparedness. We have won victories in military struggle and land reform, and we must also win a great victory on the production front! Therefore, we call on cadres at all levels and labor heroes in all places to use the spirit of overcoming difficulties in 1942 and 1943, promote the creativity of the masses, and lead the broad masses to fight against the drought themselves. Save one seedling is one seedling, save one acre is one acre, every household should prevent drought, everyone should be thrifty, and think of all ways to ensure that not a single acre of land is left uncultivated. Local experiences have proved that production is done well wherever cadres personally participate in labor, labor heroes take the lead, the party's production policy is correctly implemented, and the seasonality of agriculture is grasped, paying attention to early plowing and early sowing, and timely sowing; even in the case of drought, it is possible to overcome difficulties and carry out spot sowing and emergency sowing. In the future, we should continue to promote the fine style of cadres personally participating in the actual work, and all those who do so should be rewarded. We must earnestly overcome the phenomenon of "rather earning immediate profits than unseen profits," focusing on sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture. We must know that we are in a rural environment, and we are developing sideline occupations on the basis of agriculture. We must also overcome the idea of ​​waiting for rain among the masses and cadres who listen to nature and do not actively think of ways. (2) In production, thrift, drought prevention, and famine preparedness: First, in places where seedlings have not been sown or are insufficient, we should actively mobilize the masses to carry water for spot sowing or dry land sowing; and launch the opening of canals to divert water and dig wells. When it rains, we should seize the opportunity to rush to sow and replant after the rain. Those who have caught seedlings should promote the experience of "the hoe has water" and "hoeing the ground once is two-tenths of water," and step up the blitz of hoeing seedlings. Second, implement village funds for production self-sufficiency. Some villages in Yangcheng and Yuanqu have already done so, and the Tunliu district chief's meeting has also decided that all counties should have village funds for production self-sufficiency. This is a new direction for overcoming financial difficulties and reducing the burden on the people. This method is very good, and all villages that have undergone land reform and have a foundation should do so. Third, encourage everyone to plant ten pumpkin seedlings, plant more sweet potatoes where sweet potatoes can be planted, and plant short-term crops; store bran and collect wild vegetables for famine preparedness. Fourth, we must overcome extravagance and waste, advocate frugality, oppose eating and drinking extravagantly, persuade the masses not to perform operas, and all weddings, funerals, and celebrations should be handled frugally. Han Conglin, a labor hero from Yibi, Yangcheng, proposed the four no-wastes of "no idle meals, no extra bowl of rice, no inviting relatives to take steamed buns, and no making steamed buns for afternoon snacks." This spirit is worthy of learning from all over the world. Fifth, except for grain that is specially permitted for export by the Administrative Office, the export and smuggling of grain is strictly prohibited. This point is related to military and civilian food needs, and all localities should conduct thorough inspections. (3) All institutions, troops, groups, and individuals in the rear should carry out production and thrift. At the same time, we must achieve results, so that institutional difficulties are solved by the institutions, and individual difficulties are solved by individuals. All difficulties that can be solved by oneself or that can be endured should not be raised to the public. In the past, institutional units with a production base should strive to achieve full self-sufficiency in everything except grain and bedding. Our slogan is "Bite the bullet, produce and save, overcome difficulties, and welcome the light." We must save on food and clothing, implement per capita meals, strictly implement the grain ticket system, and all remaining grain money must be turned over to the public, and no ambushes are allowed. Everyone should save one tael of millet per day, which will be temporarily kept by the catering units themselves. The task of turning over two thousand yuan to the public must be completed and strived to be exceeded. In order to promote institutional production and thrift well, a production and thrift committee can be established to lead the work. (4) Pay attention to preventing and eliminating insect pests. Due to the lack of snow last winter and most of the land not being plowed in the autumn, the diseases and insect pests that endanger seedlings are easy to grow. Currently, insect pests have occurred in Yangcheng, Jincheng, and other places, and all localities should pay attention to preventing and eliminating them.
(By our newspaper from Taiyue, 31st) The Western District of Yangcheng has proposed a call to save one deciliter of rice per person per day in order to save for famine preparedness. It is estimated that if implemented, the entire district can save thirty stones of millet per day. This call is being responded to by the masses throughout the district, and they guarantee that each person plans to pick six catties of wild vegetables per day. Chang Shuren, director of the Su Village Farmers Association, has already stored more than 500 catties of persimmon galls for famine preparedness.

　　太岳区党委发出号召
    各级干部发扬创造组织群众防旱备荒
    【本报太岳三十一日电】太岳区党委号召生产节约防旱备荒。（一）目前全区各地普遍缺雨，旱象已成，其中以二、三、四分区为最严重。有的地方虽已落雨，但雨量不足，以致麦子普遍减收，秋苗有不少地方尚未下种，或下种后苗出不全，部分地区还影响到粮价上涨等。为了解决军需民食，有效的克服财经困难，必须以最大的努力与最大的坚持性，把生产节约防旱备荒搞好。我们在军事斗争土地改革上打了胜仗，在生产战线上也必须打一个大胜仗！因此我们号召各级干部、各地劳动英雄要以四二、四三年克服困难的精神，发扬群众的创造性，领导广大群众自己起来与旱灾作斗争。救活一苗是一苗，救活一亩是一亩，要家家防旱，人人节约，想出一切办法做到不荒一亩地。各地经验证明，凡是干部亲自动手劳动英雄带头，正确的执行党的生产政策，并抓紧农业的季节性，注意早耕早种，及时下种者，生产就搞的好；即使在天旱不雨的情形下，亦能克服困难，进行点种抢种。今后仍应发扬干部亲自动手深入实际的优良作风，凡是这样作的均应受到奖励，要认真克服“宁赚现过现，不赚眼不见”的重副业放松农业的现象。须知我们是农村环境，是在农业为主的基础上发展副业的生产方针。还必须克服群众与干部中听其自然，不积极想办法的等雨思想。（二）在生产节约防旱备荒上；第一、凡是未下种及苗不够的地方，应积极动员群众担水点种或干地寄种；并发动开渠引水打井等。已落雨时，应抓紧雨后抢种补种，已捉住苗者要发扬“锄头有水”，与“地锄一遍二分水”的经验，加紧突击锄苗。第二、实行村款生产自给，阳城、垣曲有些村已这样作了，屯留区长会议上亦已决定全县村款生产自给，这是克服财经困难减轻人民负担的新方向。这个办法很好，凡经过土地改革有基础的村，均应这样去作。第三、提倡每人种十苗南瓜，能种红薯的地方要多种红署，种短日月庄稼等；要储糠采集野菜备荒。第四、要克服铺张浪费，提倡细水长流，反对大吃大喝，说服群众不要唱戏，一切婚丧喜事均应从俭处理。阳城宜壁劳动英雄韩从林提出的“不闲吃一顿饭，不多做一碗饭，不邀亲拿馍馍，不做馍吃贴晌”的四不浪费，这种精神是值得各地学习的。第五、对粮食除经行署特许出口外，一律严禁粮食出口与走私。此点关系军需民食，各地应切实进行检查。（三）一切在后方的机关部队团体个人，均应进行生产节约。同时必须搞出成绩来，作到机关困难机关解决，个人困难个人解决，凡是自己能够解决，或能忍耐过去的困难，均不应向公家提出。在过去有生产基础的机关单位，应争取做到除粮食被服外其他全行自给。我们的口号是“咬紧牙关，生产节约，克服困难，迎接光明。”要省吃俭穿，实行按人做饭，严格粮票制度，剩粮款必须全部缴公，不准打埋伏。每人每天要节省小米一两，暂由各伙食单位自行保存。两千元缴公任务必须完成，并要争取超过。为了很好推动机关生产节约，可成立生产节约委员会领导此项工作的进行。（四）要注意防除虫害，由于去冬无雪及大部土地未经过秋刹，使危害禾苗的病虫容易生长起来，现阳城、晋城等地，均已发生虫害，各地要注意防除。
    【本报太岳三十一日电】阳城西区为节约备荒提出每人每天节省一合米号召，预计实行起来，全区每天可节约小米三十石，这一号召正获得全区群众响应，并保证每人计划每天打野菜六斤。苏村农会主任常树仁已存起五百余斤柿圪塔做备荒用。
