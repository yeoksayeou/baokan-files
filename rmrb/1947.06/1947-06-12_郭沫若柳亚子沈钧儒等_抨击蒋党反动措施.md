Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: Shanghai News reports: Democratic figures here have unanimously criticized the "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" promulgated by Chiang Kai-shek. Following the "May 20th" bloody tragedy, people from all walks of life held a symposium. Attendees included Liu Yazi, Xu Guangping, Wang Shaomou, Deng Tailin, Ma Xulun, Ye Duyi, Zhang Lan, Bao Dasan, Zhang Choubo, Tan Pingshan, Guo Moruo, Song Yunshan, Shen Tilan, Shen Junru, Ma Yinchu, and others. They unanimously agreed that students' petitions are legitimate and legal actions, worthy of respect. They pointed out that the "Temporary Measures for Maintaining Social Order" promulgated by Chiang Kai-shek are illegal. They also stated that the Chiang government has committed a major historical error, and if this situation continues to deteriorate, it will become unmanageable. University professors Ye Shengtao, Fu Binran, Yang Weiyu, Sun Qimeng, and Jia Zuzhang also wrote articles in the "Literary Gazette" pointing out: "If hunger does not stop, the anti-hunger marches and petitions will become more intense day by day. Plant melons and get melons; using resentment as seeds will inevitably produce the flowers and fruits of resentment." Finally, they advised Chiang's police to leave some room for themselves, because what the young students are demanding today is what the general public needs.

    抨击蒋党反动措施
    【新华社陕北九日电】沪报讯：此间民主人士一致抨击蒋介石所颁布之“维持社会秩序临时办法”。“五二○”流血惨案后，各界人士即举行座谈会，出席者柳亚子、许广平、王绍鍪、邓太林、马叙伦、叶笃义、张澜、包达三、张绸伯、谭平山、郭沫若、宋蕴山、沈体兰、沈钧儒、马寅初等，一致认为：学生请愿是正当合法的行为，值得敬爱。彼等指出：蒋介石所颁布之“维持社会秩序临时办法”是违法的行为。并称：今天蒋政府已犯了历史上的重大错误，此种局势如再恶化下去，将至不可收拾。大学教授叶圣陶、傅彬然、杨卫玉、孙起孟、贾祖璋亦于文艺报著文指出：“饥饿不止，反饥饿游行请愿必将一天厉害一天，种瓜得瓜，以怨恨为种子，必将产生怨恨的花果。”最后劝告蒋家宪警替自己留些余地，因为今天青年学生所要求的正是一般人民所需要的。
