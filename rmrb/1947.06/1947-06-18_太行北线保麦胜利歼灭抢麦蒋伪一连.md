　　Taihang Front News: On June 7th, our "Kong Ming" and other units of the First Military Sub-district victoriously fired the first shot in defending the wheat harvest. On the morning of the 7th, two battalions of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from Yuanshi County harassed more than ten villages including Zhicun, Gaojiazhuang, Nanbeibaolou, Mo Chi, and Zhaocun in Yuanshi, attempting to plunder wheat on a large scale. Our "Guan Gong" and "Ma Chao" units, in order to protect the masses' wheat harvest, attacked the enemy from north to south. In an hour-long street battle in Mo Chi village, the enemy launched several counterattacks and charges, but were all defeated. We killed or wounded eighty or ninety enemy soldiers, captured twenty-six enemy soldiers including a platoon leader, and seized two light machine guns, twenty-eight rifles, one pistol, twenty-four bayonets, more than three thousand rounds of ammunition, and four steel helmets.
　　[News from this newspaper] The militia in the sixth and seventh districts of Yuanshi County waged a fierce struggle to protect grain against the enemy. At 11:00 PM on May 22nd, several groups of the Home-Returning Corps from Gaoyi, in coordination with the Garrison and the Gaoyi Special Task Force, set out from Yuanshi City with the aim of pulling livestock and looting goods in various villages in Gaoyi. Our sixth district joint defense militia, in coordination with a part of the Gaoyi Independent Regiment and the district cadre team, ambushed them, captured three members of the Home-Returning Corps alive and wounded one.
　　On May 30th, over a thousand enemies raided the seventh district, robbing the masses. The entire militia in our seventh district opened fire in every village, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy in coordination with the battalion soldiers. Zhang Zhongqiu and Li Hongzi, militia members of Dakong, in order to protect the interests of the masses and complete their own plan to kill the enemy, calmly led three militia members into the tunnel, climbed to a loophole in a house. More than a dozen enemies were looting inside. Zhang Zhongqiu aimed and shot one enemy dead. Then Li Hongzi fired several shots, wounding two. The enemies fled in a panic.
