　　Diligent Completion of Tasks in the North Henan Campaign
    Telephone Bureau Improves Work Efficiency
    [This Report from Taihang] The General Telephone Bureau participated in the North Henan Campaign. From March 28th to June 2nd, they laid a total of 948 *li* of lines and repaired over 200 *li* of lines. The laying technique has greatly improved. Normally, they could lay eight *li* of lines per day, but through this campaign, they gradually trained and now can lay 60 to 70 *li* of lines a day. This is seven to ten times faster than usual, and the calls are very smooth after installation. Many model workers emerged during the work. For example, Comrade Chen Sanwa, an administrator of the General Telecommunications Bureau, in addition to doing his job well, saw that the telephone operators were very busy day and night, so he took the initiative to lead the laborers and militiamen to erect and repair lines, and helped the telephone operators to guard the switchboard, which was very hardworking. Comrades Wang Jincai, a construction cadre, and Zhou Tonglu, a platoon leader, did not sleep for three or four nights in order to complete the construction task, and their eyes were bloodshot. One day, they were so busy that they didn't even have time to eat. They also mobilized the laborers, saying, "We must resolutely complete the tasks assigned by our superiors before resting. This is a good opportunity for us to serve the people and make contributions. I hope everyone will work hard." The laborers and militiamen we led also felt very good. When the laborers were demobilized and returned home, everyone said, "We participated in the war with the Telephone Bureau this time, and they took good care of us in terms of accommodation and food. We should thank them." At the same time, they also said, "We have learned a set of skills by following the Telephone Bureau. We can erect telephone lines and also collect them, which will be of great use."
    When the Telephone Bureau was stationed in Qugou, after completing the construction task, they also took the initiative to help the masses with production, such as watering the fields, carrying manure, and harvesting wheat. The morale of all the personnel was very high, and no one showed signs of fatigue. Thanks to the efforts of all the comrades, the communication work played a great role in ensuring the North Henan Campaign. All the commanders said, "The telephone communication work has been done very well this time, which has greatly facilitated the command of the troops and the understanding of the situation."

　　在豫北战役中刻苦完成任务
    电话局工作效能提高
    【本报太行讯】电话总局这次参加豫北战役，自三月二十八日起到六月二日止，共架设九百四十八里的线，整修线路二百余里。在架设技术上大大提高了，如平时每日可架八里路的线，经这次战役中渐渐锻炼，现时一天可架六七十里的路线，比起平时工作效率增快到七倍至十倍，并且架到后通话很顺畅。在工作中出现了很多模范工作者，如电信总局管理员陈三娃同志，除对岗位工作搞好外，他看见电话员在白天黑夜很忙，他自动带领民夫及民兵去架线修线，并帮助电话员守总机，非常刻苦。架设干事王进财同志及排长周统禄同志，他们为了完成架设任务，三四夜没有睡觉，把眼都熬红。有一天因工作太忙，连饭都顾不上吃。并动员民夫说：“我们对上级指定的任务，要坚决去完成后再休息，这正是我们为民立功的良好机会，希望大家努力吧。”我们所带领的民夫及民兵，也感觉很好，在民夫复员回家时，大家说：“我们这一次参战随电话局，对我们在宿食上照顾的很周到，应向他们致谢。”同时又说：“咱们随电话局一路，学会了一套本事，会架电线，又会收割电线，将有很大用处。”
    电话局在曲沟住时，将架设任务完成之后，并自动帮助群众生产，如浇地、担粪、割麦，全体人员情绪非常高涨，没有一个人表现疲劳的现象。由于全体同志的努力，这次豫北战役通信工作起了很大保证作用，各个指挥员都说：“这次电话通讯工作作的很好，对部队指挥及了解情况，给了很大便利。”（郭继联）
