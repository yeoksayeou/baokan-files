　　After the Signing of the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty
    Imports of American Goods Surge
    Exceeding One and a Half Times Last Year's Total in One Month
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. According to the US News Service, since the signing of the Chiang-American treasonous treaty, the dumping of American goods into China has surged. The import value in February alone reached $1,153,000,000, exceeding last year's total import value of $46,600,000 by one and a half times (note: the Chiang-American Commercial Treaty was signed last November). If calculated annually, this year's total import value of American goods will reach $14 billion, an increase of over 400 times compared to the total import value of American goods in 1938, which was $34,700,000.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. Shanghai reports: American goods are penetrating every corner of the Chiang-controlled areas. Even remote inland areas like Dihua in Xinjiang are filled with American goods. In Yan'an, after its occupation by the Chiang army, large quantities of American Philips cigarettes and various glass products followed the devilish shadow of the Chiang army. Recently, giant ocean liners arrive in Shanghai daily, and even American toothpicks are shipped from San Francisco from afar. On May 22nd alone, 650 large boxes of toothpicks were shipped.

　　蒋美商约签定后
    美货入口激增
    一个月超过去年全年一倍半
    【新华社陕北九日电】据美新闻处称：蒋美卖国条约签订后，美货对华倾销激增。今年二月份一个月之输入额即达十一亿五千三百万美元，超过去年全年输入总额四万六千六百万美元之一倍半，（按蒋美商约系于去年十一月签订）。如以一年计算，今年美货输入总额将达一百四十亿美元，比之一九三八年之美货输入总额三千四百七十万美元，则增加四百倍以上。
    【新华社陕北九日电】沪报讯：美货在蒋区无孔不入，连远处边陆之新疆迪化等地，亦美货充塞。在蒋军占领后之延安市上，大批美国飞利浦香烟及各种玻璃用品也尾随蒋军魔影而至。最近每日有大洋巨轮抵沪，连美国的牙签也不远千里自旧金山运来，五月二十二日一天，单运到的牙签即有六百五十大箱。
