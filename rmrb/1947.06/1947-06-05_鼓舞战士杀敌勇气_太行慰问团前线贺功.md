My original name was Wang Yulin, and I changed my name and surname in preparation for deserting. Now I understand that I was wrong, and I must make contributions to the people."

　　鼓舞战士杀敌勇气
    太行慰问团前线贺功
    【本报豫北讯】太行分社记者报道：在豫北前线某部进行慰问工作的太行慰问团，普遍为解放汤阴立功战士贺功献花，鼓舞了战士们的杀敌勇气，推动与组织了新的战斗。该团祝捷庆功会上，七个代表为四十多位功臣献花，将花尊敬的插向功臣胸前，全体便都欢呼和跳跃起来了。战士们一致喊着：“要更多的杀敌人捉俘虏，回答太行父老兄妹对我们的热望，特别受感动的是新解放战士，他们目睹后方人民对人民军队的爱戴及人民给予功臣的最大光荣，有的就感动的落泪了。“从来没见过人民这样爱自己的军队。”在汤阴城头立了特等功的上官战斗解放战士左六臣、杨德义等他们从回忆过去的痛苦生活与今天的杀敌功绩很自然的体验到：“解放区就是自己的家，就是自己的母亲，要誓死从解放区打回老家去。”由于全体士气的百倍提高，许多战士便都连夜争相订定新的杀敌计划，准备再次战场立功。
    【又讯】慰问豫北前线某部的太行慰问团代表提出：“解放区要为新解放立功战士进行贺功，使家不在解放区的功臣亦同样得到更关切的温暖。”这一提议普遍获得新解放战士最热烈的拥护，士气更加高涨。部队首长亦热烈赞同。一个解放战士功臣说：“在解放军里，功臣有名，虽死亦生。中央军那能这样，解放区真是我亲爱的母亲。”三营新解放战士刘子洪感慨的坦白说：“我真对不起解放区的父老，我原名叫王玉林，改名换姓是准备开小差，现在我明白自己错了，我一定要为人民立功。”现代表团已与部队政治部初步商定：今后以团或旅为单位，历次将各解放战士功臣的功绩详报到解放区来，在解放区普遍的为他们贺功。此办法已由代表团带回报告上级。
