　　Organize Strength to Hoe and Fight Drought
    Jincheng Eighth District Hoes Seedlings a Second Time
    [Our newspaper Taiyue Seventeenth dispatch] District and village cadres in Jincheng Eighth District gathered on the third of this month to report and summarize hoeing. In the entire district, across seventeen administrative villages, 32,447.3 mu of millet, corn, and cotton, which would have required half a month to complete using the sporadic hoeing methods of previous years, were all hoed in ten days this year due to the widespread organization of semi-laborers. Among them, 1,389.6 mu of cotton were hoed twice. According to statistics, besides a portion of male laborers supporting the front lines, the remaining 2,884 people, along with 1,540 women, 1,291 children, and 542 military dependents, revolutionary martyrs' families, cadres, and honorably discharged veterans, were all involved in the hoeing movement. 13,939 mutual aid workdays were invested, all put into sideline production, achieving the goal of not neglecting agriculture, sideline occupations, and participation in the war. Beizhai Village is the champion in the district in organizing hoeing and saving labor. Under the active leadership of the cadres, all the full and semi-laborers in the village were organized, seizing the time day and night to rush hoeing. For example, when hoeing seedlings was particularly tense, many silkworm raisers could not go to the fields because the silkworms were about to mature. The cadres then guided everyone to cut mulberry branches in the early morning and afternoon breaks, letting the children and the elderly feed the silkworms. The rest of the people continued to hoe the seedlings as usual, actually completing the autumn seedling hoeing that used to take half a month in seven days. They also organized transportation and dug medicinal herbs with the remaining labor, earning 13,600 yuan. They are currently hoeing the seedlings for the second time.
    [Our newspaper Taiyue Sixteenth dispatch] Beipo Village in Jincheng organized to hoe seedlings, completing more than 1,200 mu in ten days, saving more than 680 workdays compared to previous years. After sowing, the mutual aid groups began to prepare for hoeing. Women milled rice and ground flour, and men went down the mountains to transport goods, completing half a month of household chores. Therefore, when hoeing began, all 254 full and semi-laborers, men, women, and children, in the village were able to go to the fields to hoe seedlings. Each group accurately calculated the time and division of labor. For example, the Wu Hei transport group prepared the next day's dry food the night before, brought a meal to the field in the morning, and did not return until dark. Wu Hei Yun and Fu Zhen's mothers, who could not hold a hoe, also led the children in the field to collect firewood and cook rice soup; at the same time, because the manpower was concentrated and the groups were not far apart, competitions were launched. Group A helped Group B after finishing hoeing, so in seven days they hoed 780.4 mu of millet, and in three days they hoed 420 mu of corn.

　　组织力量多锄抗旱
    晋城八区锄二遍苗
    【本报太岳十七日电】晋城八区区村干部于本月三日集会汇报总结锄苗，全区十七个行政村，三万二千四百四十七亩三分谷子，玉茭，棉花，按往年零星锄法，必须半月时间才能完成，今年由于广泛的将半劳力组织起来，十天内便如数锄完。其中并有一千三百八十九亩六分棉花锄过两遍。据统计各村除部分男劳力支援前线外，其余二千八百八十四人及妇女一千五百四十人，儿童一千二百九十一人，军、烈、干属与荣退军人五百四十二人，全都卷入锄苗运动中。互助省工一万三千九百卅九个，全数投入副业生产，作到农业、副业、参战三不误。北寨村在组织锄苗与节约劳力上为全区之冠，该村在干部的积极领导之下全村全半劳力全部组织起来，日以继夜的抓紧时间抢锄，例如正当紧张锄茁之际，许多喂蚕户因蚕将要成熟，不能上地，干部便引导大家在五更与歇晌时间砍桑枝，让儿童及年老的去喂蚕。其余的人仍照常锄苗，竟把往年需锄半月的秋苗在七天内锄完了。并以余工组织运输与刨药材，赚洋一万三千六百元。目前正在锄二遍苗。
    【本报太岳十六日电】晋城北坡村组织起来锄苗，十天内锄完一千二百余亩，较往年省工六百八十余个。该村于下种之后，互助组内即分头作锄苗准备，女人碾米、推磨，男人下山运输，作完半月家庭零活，因此，当锄苗开始时，全村男女老少全半劳力二百五十四人能够全部上地锄苗。各组皆精确的计算时间与分工，如毋黑运小组头天晚上即将第二天的干粮准备好，早上带一顿饭上地，直至天黑才回来，毋黑运与福珍的老娘不能握锄，也在地里领导孩子拾柴、熬米汤；同时，由于人力集中，各组相离不远，便展开了竞赛，甲组锄完帮助乙组，因此在七天内即锄完七百八十亩零四分谷子，三天内锄完四百二十亩玉茭。
