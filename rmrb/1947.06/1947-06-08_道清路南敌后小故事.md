　　Small Stories from Behind Enemy Lines South of the Daoqing Railway
    Li Ping, Hu Zhirui
    (I) One Thousand Yuan and Six Hundred Thousand
    When the Kuomintang troops first arrived in Fengfeng, each household that had been struggled against was given one thousand yuan. The struggle targets were bewildered and said, "Our troops have arrived. Although it's not much, the gift is small, but the sentiment is great!" After staying for more than a month, they levied 1,400 yuan per mu of land and three sheng of wheat. They levied taxes two or three times a month. This year, the Kuomintang felt that this kind of levy was far from enough, so they increased it tenfold or a hundredfold. Two wealthy households, ××, were asked to pay 400,000 yuan and 600,000 yuan respectively. The wealthy households also changed their faces. "Oh, it started with one thousand yuan, but six hundred thousand can't be the end!"
    (II) Landlords Turn Around
    Apart from the die-hard secret agents and local despotic landlords, most of the landlords who had been struggled against still believed in our policies. Some never turned over any fruits of labor, such as ××× from Chouhua Village. We visited the village several times, and he remained unmoved. This time, when our militia team returned to the village, he greeted us very politely and helped to brush off the slogans. He said, "I knew you would come back."
    Xu Bangyan, a landlord from Dinghe, initially turned over some fruits of labor. The pseudo-self-defense regiment leader, Lü Enpu, told him to use the struggle proceeds to buy two items but forbade him from saying, "Even if we hand it over, we won't get anything. Why provoke that person?" Later, small households deliberately came to his door to give him things, but he refused them all.
    Liang Guojie, a struggle target in Xindian, immediately gave a small cloth shirt to Xiao Budeng (a fourteen-year-old basic mass child) when he returned from outside. The next day, Xiao Budeng went to his house to grind corn, and he took out some corn for Budeng and told the women in the house to help him grind it.
    Cao Thirteen and Cao Fourteen from Zaodian, who lived in Jiaozuo and dared not return home, wrote to the village saying, "I, this old rich man, can't be a landlord anymore. Let the small households take care of the wheat."

　　道清路南敌后小故事
    李平、胡之锐
    （一）一千元和六十万
    国民党军队刚到冯封，每个被斗过的户，发给一千元钱，斗争对象们头脑弄昏了，都说：“咱的队伍来了。虽不多吧，可是礼轻人义重啊！”住了一个多月以后，每亩地起一千四百元款，三升麦子，又按月起过二、三次，到今年，国民党感到这样起款太不够花了，便十倍百倍的加起来，××两个富户一家出四十万，一家出六十万，富户也变脸了，“噢，一千元开头，六十万还不能结尾呢！”
    （二）地主回头
    除了死心塌地的特务恶霸地主外，大部被斗过的地主还是相信我们的政策，有的始终没倒过果实，如仇化庄×××，我们去过村几次，他都安安未动，这回咱们民兵队回村，他很客气的招呼咱们，并帮助刷洗标语，他说：“我知道你们不会不回来的”。
    定和地主许邦彦，开始倒了一部果实，伪自卫团长吕恩普叫他拿斗争果实买了二条还不许说：“倒了咱也得不上，光惹那人干啥”。以后小户故意上门去给他送，他都不要了。
    新店斗争对象梁国杰，当小布登（十四岁一个基本群众小孩）从外边回去后，他马上给了一件小布衫，第二天小布登又去他家磨玉茭，他又拿出些玉茭给布登，并叫家里女人帮他磨。
    造店曹十三、曹十四，住在焦作不敢回家，给村写信说：“我这老财也当不开啦，麦子该叫小户收拾收拾吧。”
