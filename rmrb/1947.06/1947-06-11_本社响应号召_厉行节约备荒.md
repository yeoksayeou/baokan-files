　　Headquarters Responds to Call
    Practices Thrift and Prepares for Famine
    [Reported by this newspaper] Following the publication of this newspaper's editorial "Launch a Drought Resistance, Famine Preparation, Production and Thrift Movement" on the 8th of this month, comrades at the headquarters were the first to respond. On the same day, the administration and the Party branch convened a joint meeting to discuss how the agency should carry out production, thrift, drought resistance, famine preparation and other issues. It was decided that first, each department should seriously discuss the editorial to ensure that every comrade fully understands the severity of the drought and the importance of drought resistance and famine preparation, and to make sufficient ideological preparations, promoting the experience and arduous spirit of overcoming the disaster in 1943. At the same time, it was proposed that practicing thrift and production, and stopping waste, are the current urgent tasks, and each department and each comrade must strictly implement them. Starting from today, each person will save three liang of millet per day. Guest meals must strictly implement the grain coupon and food cost system. The management section and the kitchen must achieve "not wasting a grain of rice or a drop of oil." All office supplies will be discussed in the near future, and in principle, a budget should be made from the minimum limit, and a reduction plan should be formulated for each department. In general, do not use glazed paper or other imported goods. Clippings and letters should make the most of waste paper, and other expenses such as lamp oil and medicine should also be saved as much as possible; it must be recognized that this is a regular task and must be carried out. In terms of production, in addition to completing the task of public production, all comrades will continue personal production, establish household affairs, and solve their own difficulties. Now all departments have begun to brew discussions and formulate specific thrift plans. (Xiu Shi)
