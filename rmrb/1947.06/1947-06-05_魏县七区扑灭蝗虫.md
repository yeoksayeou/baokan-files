　　[Report from Jinan, Hebei, 3rd] A large number of locusts appeared in the eastern part of the Seventh District on the south bank of the Zhang River in Weixian County. The district has mobilized more than a thousand people to intensify the capture and beating of the locusts and also mobilized more than a thousand people from the fourth and sixth districts to assist in the capture. The discovered locusts have now been completely eliminated. In order to completely eradicate the locust nymphs, the leadership has arranged for all villages to conduct strict inspections. If locust nymphs reappear, villages will eliminate them themselves if there are few. If there are many, the district will be notified to coordinate forces. The masses are also called upon to cultivate wasteland and dig up eggs to eliminate the root of the harm.
　　[Report from Taihang] Various pests such as "Black Granny" and "Cutworm" have been discovered in Ping, Hu, and other places, eating small seedlings everywhere.
