Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th. Before the wheat harvest, Zhuting County, behind enemy lines, launched a political offensive focusing on protecting the wheat harvest, opposing retribution, and opposing conscription for a concentrated week. Local armed forces in the Sanyang District produced a large number of cartoon leaflets with simple lyrics such as: "The wheat is turning yellow, the evil landlords shouldn't dream, if you cut the masses' wheat, your future won't be long." "Returning land is the right thing to do, reason can be found everywhere, if you knock down the masses' wheat, landmines will be buried in your field." to warn the restored landlords. Landlords returning to their villages around Songzhuang all reflected, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't make empty promises, it's better to be honest." The masses behind enemy lines are preparing to rush the harvest with courage and strength because they have armed support. Local armed forces in the Zhendong District implemented a "military-political combination," on the one hand advancing to the Shahe River to arrest seventeen members of the returning corps, and on the other hand holding victory celebrations in each village to celebrate the annihilation of Chiang's 74th Division, and writing more than 150 letters so that more than 30 restored landlords did not dare to take the fruits of the harvest. Under the influence of the execution of the evil pseudo-Baolang Wang Xingsheng in Liwayao ditch, more than 30 villages voluntarily stopped supplying the enemy. The Sanyang District exposed the crimes of the Chiang army and Chiang's government in many ways. The democratic government issued a mobilization order against conscription, calling on and organizing youths in the Chiang-occupied areas to refuse to participate in the pseudo-"self-defense corps." The pseudo-regime's "returning corps" was registered for good and evil using red and black dots, and a list of good and evil deeds was published regularly. The masses in Chengguan and other districts used the method of "sending messages" to publicize the policies of the People's Liberation Army. According to incomplete statistics, 694 households have returned home to harvest wheat, 256 members of the "returning corps" have been disintegrated, and 67 Chiang soldiers and Chiang's secret agents have been captured.

　　保麦保田反倒算
    竹庭县开展政攻
    【新华社山东八日电】麦收前，蒋后竹庭县以保卫麦收、反倒算、反抓丁为中心，展开政治攻势突击周。三阳区地方武装制成大批漫画传单，写着：“麦子黄又黄，恶霸地主莫胡想，你若割了群众麦，保管后路不永长。”“土地回家理应当，道理那里都能讲，你若倒了群众的麦，地雷埋在你场上。”等通俗歌词，以警告复辟地主。宋庄一带地主还乡都反映：“八路可不说虚言，还是老实些好。”蒋后群众因有武装撑腰，胆大气壮，正准备抢收。镇南区地方武装实行“武政结合”，一面进至沙河逮捕还乡团十七名，一面在各村召开歼蒋七十四师祝捷大会，并写一百五十余封信使得再金三十余复辟地主不敢倒果实。在李瓦窑沟恶霸伪保长王兴盛伏法影响下，三十余村自动停止资敌。三阳区多方揭发蒋军蒋政罪行，民主政府发出反抓丁动员令，号召与组织蒋占区青年拒绝参加伪“自卫团”。对伪政权“还乡团”用红黑点实行善恶登记，定期公布善恶榜。城关等区群众用“捎口信”办法，宣传解放军政策，被骗群众相继回家收麦者，据不完全统计已有六百九十四户，瓦解“还乡团”二百五十六人，俘蒋军蒋特六十七名。
