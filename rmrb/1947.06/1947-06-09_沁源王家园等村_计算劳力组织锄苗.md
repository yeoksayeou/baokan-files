[Reported from Taiyue on the 7th] Wangjiayuan and Congziyu villages in Qinyuan County precisely calculated labor needs and organized weeding. The Wangjiayuan mutual aid brigade held a general meeting of all members on May 26th to reorganize and transition into a weeding brigade. During the planting season, there were 21 groups, which were consolidated into 12 larger groups to accommodate summer weeding. Precise calculations were made to allocate labor for the first weeding: one labor unit can weed 0.6 fen of millet per day, requiring a total of 966 labor units. For corn, one labor unit can weed 1.5 mu, requiring 366 labor units. For small hemp, one labor unit can weed 0.5 mu, requiring 50 labor units. For beans, one labor unit can weed 2 mu, requiring 73 labor units. Other odd jobs require 54 labor units. Thus, a total of 1,458 mu of autumn fields in the entire brigade require 1,517 labor units. According to the entire brigade's male and female full and semi-labor force, equivalent to 107 full labor units, the weeding can be completed in 14 days. Organized labor can accomplish the work of three to four laborers, completing the task two days earlier. Immediately following, the wheat harvest will begin, with a total of 1,150 mu of wheat in the entire brigade. One labor unit can harvest an average of 2 mu per day, so 107 people can complete the harvest in five and a half days. After precise calculations, surplus labor can be organized for intensive cultivation and sideline production. The brigade plans to plow all wheat fields this year and weed millet, corn, and yam fields three times each. From May 21st, Congziyu village mobilized all 85 laborers, except for 32 workers in the coal mine and 5 people in the cooperative store. Each labor unit can weed an average of 1.2 mu per day, weeding 102 mu per day. The village's autumn fields, totaling over 1,500 mu, can be weeded in 15 days. According to this calculation, after the first weeding, there will be a surplus of 16 laborers who can be sent out for transportation or seasonal work. Even if participating in the war effort and providing labor, it will not affect production.

[Reported from Zuoquan] The Fifth District carried out rush planting without neglecting participation in the war effort and production. The entire district completed planting in just over 20 days (including manure delivery). Now the seedlings have all emerged and are growing vigorously. The masses say, "Those who planted early have benefited, while those who planted late may not be able to emerge now!" With the victory in the war effort and the completion of planting in the rear, it is truly a double celebration. Houzhuang village in Shuipo and other villages have commended the war heroes and production heroes, as well as textile model workers. Xin'dian, Gaojiajing, Shuipo, Yangjiao, and other villages have all begun weeding. Pan'nao village alone has weeded 158 mu, and the entire district has weeded over ten qing. Some villages, stubbornly adhering to planting according to the season, have failed to plant half of their land. Now everyone realizes they have suffered losses and are stepping up efforts to carry water for emergency planting. In addition to watering the paddy fields for planting, dry land is also being worked on. (Shu Ping, Lin Zhu, Zi Sheng)

　　沁源王家园等村
    计算劳力组织锄苗
    【本报太岳七日电】沁源王家园、聪子峪两村，精确计算劳力，组织锄苗，王家园互助大队于五月二十六日召开全体队员大会，整顿组织，转为锄苗大队。在下种时期曾有二十一个小组为适应夏季锄苗，集中为十二个大组。并精确计算，配备力量锄第一遍苗，一工每天锄谷六分，共需工九百六十六个。王茭一工锄一亩半，需工三百六十六个。小麻一工锄半亩，需工五十个。豆子一工锄二亩，需工七十三个。其他零工五十四个。这样，全大队一千四百五十八亩秋田，共需工一千五百一十七个。按全大队男女全半劳力，共折合为一百零七个全劳力，十四天即可全部锄完。组织起来三工顶四工，可提早两天完成。紧接着便要收麦，全大队共一千一百五十亩麦，一工每天平均割二亩，一百零七人五天半即可割完。精确计算下来，余工可有组织的进行精耕细作与副业生产。该大队计划今年麦地普遍犁过，谷子、玉茭、山药地普遍锄三遍。聪子峪从五月二十一日起，全村除煤窑三十二个工人及合作社门市上五人外，劳力八十五人全部组织起来，每工每天平均锄苗一亩二分，一天锄一百零二亩，全村秋田一千五百余亩，十五天即可锄完。如此计算，锄第一遍苗后，尚可余工十六个。可出外运输或打忙工。如果参战出夫，亦不影响生产。
    【本报左权讯】五区在参战生产两不误下进行了抢种，全区在二十多天中（送粪在内）全部下种。现在小苗已全部出齐，长的很茂盛，群众说：“谁早下种沾了光，迟下种现在可出不来啦！”参战胜利了，后方生产也下种完成，真是双喜进门。水坡后庄等村并给参战英雄与生产英雄，纺织模范贺功。新店、高家井、水坡、羊角等村都已开始锄苗。仅盘瑙一村已锄苗一百五十八亩，全区已锄十余顷。个别村因固执按季节下种，一半土地未能下种，现在大家都知道吃了亏，正加紧进行突击担水点种。除水地浇了下种外旱地正进行。（树屏、林珠、子胜）
