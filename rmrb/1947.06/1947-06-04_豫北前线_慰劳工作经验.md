Experiences in Comfort Work on the Northern Henan Front
    By Zhu Yaoting

    With the frequent victories reported from the Northern Henan Front, the people of Taihang are enthusiastically caring for their soldiers. Each county selected 156 representatives, carrying 34,000 comfort bags, nearly 10,000 comfort letters, and many other assorted comfort goods. They represented six million enthusiastic hearts, rushing to the front line to conduct comfort activities, forming a large-scale mass comfort movement. They gave the soldiers infinite warmth and also organized and promoted the movement to kill the enemy and perform meritorious deeds at the front. They also brought the heroic fighting and arduous life of the soldiers at the front to the people of Taihang, promoting the movement to perform meritorious deeds on the production front. This comfort work combined the fighting will of the front and rear, adding infinite strength to the patriotic self-defense war. This comfort effort demonstrated the special creativity of the people of Taihang after liberation and has rich experience that deserves our careful understanding. Here, we present several issues for the reference of our neighboring front lines.

            I. Forming a Mass Comfort Movement

    First, it is necessary to widely publicize the news of the victory at the front and combine it with mobilizing the masses to do comfort work. Only in this way can a mass comfort movement be formed. Only then will the masses think of various ways to express their feelings. Only in this way will the content be rich, and only then will a mutual education and encouragement between the front and rear be formed, and a great competition for killing the enemy and production will unfold between the front and rear. This issue is the primary link in doing a good job in comfort work.

            II. Expressing the Hearts and Feelings of the Masses in Every Link

    In the patriotic self-defense war of more than a year, the soldiers lived a tense fighting life every day and extremely needed enthusiastic comfort. As Taihang soldiers said: "Don't even mention that you come to see us; for a year, we haven't even seen a stone. Seeing a stone makes us feel close and dear." After receiving the comfort bags, the soldiers hung them on their waists during marches, taking them out to look at them every few steps. When sleeping, they hung the comfort bags on the opposite wall. When they couldn't sleep, everyone would look at the comfort bags and comment on their quality. The soldiers requested to write back to the person who made the comfort bag to express their feelings. This illustrates the great role of the comfort bag, and at the same time, this kind of mass emotion deserves our great attention and understanding. And only by mobilizing the broad masses can we respond to the soldiers' feelings and meet their requirements.

    In every link and form of comfort work, the greater the achievements in expressing the hearts of the masses, the better the results; otherwise, it will become a mere formality. The most important things are comfort bags and comfort letters. The comfort bags should be made exquisitely, with flowers and words embroidered on them, and the address and name of the maker should be embroidered on them. It is not good to simply write a few words. The value of the items inside is not important; they should contain local specialties, preferably those that can showcase the flavor of Taihang. The comfort letters should be written by mobilizing the masses, expressing what is in their hearts. It is imperative that cadres not take over and write them uniformly. Mass-produced comfort letters have very little effect. As for the representatives, they must be able to understand this kind of heart of the masses, respect the masses' love for the soldiers, and cherish the comfort goods, taking good care of them and not allowing them to be damaged or diminished in any way. When conducting various forms of comfort activities on the front line, it is necessary to grasp this spirit at all times.

            III. Comfort Work is Mass Political Work

    Both the representatives and the cadres of the troops should clarify this concept. Both sides should cooperate well. Beforehand, the troops should introduce the situation and the soldiers' thoughts to the representatives in detail. Some units attach great importance to this work, not only introducing the situation in detail and providing various conveniences for the representatives' activities, but also assigning people to record for illiterate representatives. The troops' cultural and political activities also centered on this work, which achieved good results. Some units do not have sufficient understanding of this political work, thinking that the representatives' activities are in conflict with their own political work. For example, the instructor of a certain company was leading the soldiers in drawing up a plan to attack Anyang, fearing that the comfort group would disturb the soldiers' thoughts and not giving the representatives an opportunity to conduct activities. This missed a good opportunity to educate the troops.

            IV. Carefully Select Representatives, and Representatives Should Have a Correct Attitude

    Representatives who are selected by the masses can generally represent the hearts of the masses. In particular, killing-the-enemy heroes, labor heroes, and model military dependents are most welcomed by the soldiers. They can tell the soldiers about the liberation, production, and preferential treatment of military families in the rear in their entirety, and they can respond to the feelings of the soldiers. Conversely, some representatives who are just there to make up numbers cannot carry out activities at all. Some representatives who do not respect themselves even casually buy things from the soldiers, losing the representative's position and giving people an extremely bad impression.

    Before the representatives carry out activities, they should be mobilized to clarify that they are here to comfort the troops, and they should also choose to visit the heroic deeds of the soldiers. When the soldiers ask about the situation in the rear, they should honestly explain the various tasks without exaggerating in the slightest. At the same time, they should make appropriate self-criticisms. Only in this way will the soldiers be convinced and believe in our work. Conversely, some representatives think that the soldiers have many ideological problems, and they adopt an attitude of solving ideological problems for them, talking a lot about the various tasks in the rear, which turns into boasting. The soldiers are not convinced when they hear it, thinking it is bragging.

            V. Take Care of Soldiers' Local Sentiments and Appropriately Allocate Representatives

    When assigning representatives, it is necessary to first understand which regiment has the most soldiers from which county, and then allocate two more representatives from that county. This has many advantages, both public and private. For example, when soldiers see people from their hometown, they describe their family situation and say, "Seeing you is like seeing my family. I originally planned to go home to see them, but now I won't go back." If the representative is far from the soldier's hometown, and the representative introduces the situation of the rear work for a long time, the soldier says: "The work is good in your place, but who knows what's going on with my family?" While taking care of local relations, it is also necessary to take care of the universality of the representatives. Each column should have at least one representative from each county in order to be called the Taihang Comfort Group, and the scale will also appear grand.

            VI. Several Ways for Representatives to Conduct Activities

    (1) Heroes' Meeting. Heroes such as Zhang Xigui and Bai Gui held a "Heroes' Meeting" in a certain unit. The heroes exchanged heroic deeds with each other. This is an exchange that concentrates the work of the front and rear. The front and rear carry out competitions with each other, which plays the greatest role in promoting the movement to perform meritorious deeds.

    (2) After each representative conducts in-depth visits and the soldiers deliberate, when blackboard newspapers are posted, forming a comfort opinion, the representatives proposed at the Meritorious Service Celebration Conference: "Everything is good in the rear. The people are most concerned that there are still more than 3,000 Returning Home Corps in Anyang City. We hope that the troops can capture these Returning Home Corps." The soldiers all stood up, raised their fists, and replied to the demands of the masses. Everyone shouted slogans: "Resolutely take Anyang City, capture 3,000 Returning Home Corps alive, send that district to that district, send that county to that county, and hand them over to the masses for disposal." This greatly encouraged the soldiers and directly promoted the current combat mission.

    (3) Deep into the Activities of Each Company. At the beginning, five or six representatives went to the company to conduct individual talks. Many soldiers were idle on the sidelines, which wasted time and made some comrades feel neglected. Later, they separated to conduct activities in the squad. Each representative talked with two or three soldiers, so the problems were discussed more deeply and more warmly.

    (4) When soliciting the opinions of the soldiers, some used the company as a unit. Under the mutual influence, the soldiers collectively complained to the representatives. This is a failed experience. Some went deep into the squads and used individual chats. Good things and bad things were talked about. Some problems were solved in the chats. This experience is good.

    (5) When the representatives talk to the soldiers, they should be appropriate to their status. Liberation heroes can talk more about liberation stories, and labor heroes can talk more about production issues, especially during large meetings. Some student representatives also talked about liberation and production issues, which resulted in irrelevant talk. If they talked about how children respect military dependents, fetch firewood and carry water for them, and how they pay New Year's visits and congratulate military dependents during the New Year, it would be very vivid and equally able to meet the soldiers' needs.

            VII. It is Necessary to Enable the Representatives to Achieve a Unified Understanding of the Issues Raised by the Soldiers

    The representatives enthusiastically collect the opinions of the soldiers and, with the most responsible spirit, prepare to bring these opinions back for resolution. This responsible spirit is very valuable; however, precisely because of their enthusiasm, individual soldiers sometimes have an uncalm view of the problems, a deviation in their view of the work in the village, and a complaining mood about the work. For example, saying: "We have only done the bottom thing in ten years." Some even hated the village cadres, thinking that more village cadres like this should be rectified. These thoughts must be straightened out, and a unified and correct understanding must be achieved.

　　豫北前线
    慰劳工作经验
    朱耀庭
    豫北前线捷报纷传，太行人民热情的关怀着自己的子弟兵。各县选出一百五十六个代表，携带慰问袋三万四千个，慰问信将近万封，及许多各色各样的慰劳品，他们代表着六百万颗热情的心，赶来火线进行慰劳，形成了大规模的群众性的慰劳运动。他们给了战士无限的温暖，更组织推动了前线的杀敌立功运动。又将前方战士的英勇战斗坚苦生活带给了太行人民，在生产战线上推动立功运动。这次慰劳工作，把前后方的战斗意志结合了起来，为爱国自卫战争增添了无限的力量。这次慰劳，表现了太行人民翻身后的特殊创造性，有丰富的经验，值得我们很好的体会。这里特提出几个问题，以供各友邻战线参考。
            一、形成群众性的慰劳运动
    首先要普遍宣传前方胜利消息，结合在群众中做慰劳动员，这才能形成群众性的慰劳运动，群众才会想出各色各样的形式来表达自己的心情，只有如此，内容才会丰富，才会形成前后方互相教育，互相鼓励，前后方展开杀敌生产大竞赛。这个问题是慰问工作作好的首要环节。
            二、每个环节上要表达出群众的心意和情感
    一年多的爱国自卫战争中，战士整天过着紧张的战斗生活，极其需要热情的慰问。如太行战士说：“不要说你们来看俺们，我们一年来连块石头也看不到，看到一块石头也觉得亲近可爱。”战士们接到慰问袋后，行军中挂在腰间，走几步拿起来看一看，睡觉时把慰问袋挂在对面墙上，睡不着时大家就瞧着慰问袋评论好坏，战士们要求向做慰问袋的本人写回信，来表达自己的心意。这里说明了慰问袋作用之大，同时这种群众的情感值得我们很好的重视和体会。而战士们这种情感，只有把广大群众动员起来，才能和他们的心情相应，来满足他们的要求。
    在慰劳工作的各个环节与各种形式上，凡能表现出群众心意的成绩就大，否则就会流于形式。最重要的是慰问袋和慰问信，慰问袋要做得精致，上面要刺上花、绣上字，要刺上做者的地址和名字，简单的只写上几个字是不好的，里边装东西不在值钱多少，要装特产，最好能表现出太行的风味来。慰问信要发动群众来写，要说出群众心里的话，千万不要由干部包办，千篇一律印成的慰问信作用是很小的。在代表们说来，要能体会群众的这种心意，尊重群众对战士的热爱，对慰劳品要十分珍贵，加以很好的保管，不使其有丝毫损坏与减色。到前线进行各种形式的慰问时，时时刻刻要掌握这种精神。
            三、慰问工作是群众性的政治工作
    不论代表与部队干部都应明确这个观念，双方要很好的配合，事前部队要向代表详细介绍情况，战士的思想等。有的单位对这工作非常重视，不但详细介绍了情况，给代表各种活动上的方便，并派人为不识字的代表做记录，部队文化政治活动也以这一工作为中心，这就收到了良好的效果。有些单位对这一政治工作认识不足，以为代表的活动和自己的政治工作是矛盾的，如某连指导员正在领导战士订打安阳的杀敌计划，怕慰问团扰乱了战士的心思，不给代表活动的机会，这就错过了很好的对部队教育的时机。
            四、慎重选择代表，代表要有正确态度
    要是经群众选择出来的代表，一般都能代表群众的心意，特别是杀敌英雄、劳动英雄、模范军属，最受战士欢迎，他们能把后方翻身、生产、优军原原本本的告诉给战士，能和战士的心情相应。相反的某些凑数代表，根本活动不开，甚至某些不自重的代表，竟随便买战士的东西，失掉代表立场，给人以极恶劣的印象。
    代表进行活动前，应进行动员，使大家明确自己是来慰问部队的，还就要选访战士英雄事迹，而战士问到后方情形时，就将各种工作老老实实的讲出来，丝毫不要夸大，同时要适当的作检讨，只有这样，战士才会心服，才会相信我们的工作。相反的某些代表，以为战士存在很多思想问题，自己就以给人家解决思想问题的态度，大讲后方的各种工作，形成了夸功，战士们听了不服气，以为是吹牛。
            五、照顾战士乡土观念适当配备代表
    分配代表时，应先了解×团那县战士最多，就把那县代表多分配两个去，这样公私兼顾有许多好处。如战士见了本乡人，叙述家庭情况后有的说：“见了你就跟见了俺家的人一样，我本打算回家去看看，现在不回去了。”如代表离战士家乡很远，代表向战士介绍了半天后方工作情况，战士说：“你们那里工作好，谁知俺家是怎么一回事？”照顾乡土关系，又要照顾代表的普遍性，每个纵队至少要有各县一个代表，这才能称得起太行慰问团，规模也显得宏大。
            六、代表们活动的几种方式
    （一）英雄会。张喜贵、白贵等英雄在×部队举行了“英雄会”，英雄们相互交谈英雄事迹，这是前后方工作集中起来的交流，前后方相互开展竞赛，在推动立功运动上作用最大。
    （二）经各代表深入访问，战士酝酿，出门板报，形成慰问舆论时，在贺功大会上，代表们提出：“后方啥也好，老百姓最关心安阳城还有三千多个还乡团，希望部队能将这些还乡团捉回来。”战士们都站起来了举着拳头答复群众的要求，大家喊着口号：“坚决拿下安阳城，活捉三千个还乡团，那区送那区，那县送那县，交给群众来处理。”给战士极大之鼓励，直接推动了当前的战斗任务。
    （三）深入各连活动。才开始五、六个代表到连里去，进行个别谈话，好多战士闲在一边，既浪费时间，又使某些同志觉得冷淡。后来分开到班里活动，每个代表和两三个战士一块谈话，这样问题谈得又深刻又显得亲热。
    （四）征求战士们的意见时，有的以连为单位，在互相影响下，形成了战士集体向代表诉苦，这是失败的经验。有的深入班中用个别闲谈方式，好的坏的都谈了出来，有些问题在闲扯中，就得到了解决，这个经验是好的。
    （五）代表们向战士谈话，要适合自己的身分，翻身英雄可多讲翻身故事，劳动英雄多讲生产问题，特别是大会讲话时更为重要。有一些学生代表，也来讲翻身生产等问题，结果驴头不对马嘴，如果讲儿童怎样尊重军属，给他们打柴担水，过年时如何给军属拜年道喜，那就十分生动，同样能适应战士们的要求。
            七、要使代表对战士提出的问题取得统一认识
    代表们热情的收集战士的意见，用最负责的精神，准备将这些意见带回，求得解决，这种负责精神是十分宝贵；但正因为其热情，有时反使个别战士对问题看法不冷静，对村中工作看法发生偏差，产生对工作埋怨情绪。如说：“我们十年了就干了个底”。甚至有的对村干部仇恨起来，以为像这样的村干部就应多整几个。这些思想必须弄通，取得一致的正确认识。
