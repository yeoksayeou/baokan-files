　　Liushenggou Coal Mine Workers' Militia
    Voluntarily Requests Wage Reduction
    [Our Newspaper] The Liushenggou Coal Mine workers' militia has extremely high enthusiasm for production and thrift to support the front lines. In May, they already handed over more than 150,000 yuan in support funds for the front lines. Recently, seeing that the mine's expenses were very large and it was experiencing economic difficulties, all the members voluntarily requested a wage reduction. Comrade Fan Qiyun said: "When the Japanese were in Guantai, we only earned three dou of rice (coarse rice) and a bag of flour (mixed) a month, and we were still deducted and it wasn't enough. After liberation, our monthly salary was 360 jin of millet. Our living standards have improved to the heavens. This is the welfare that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have provided for us. Now, Chiang Kai-shek is fighting a civil war, causing difficulties for our factory. How can we not care about our own factory? I have to reduce the burden on the public." Every comrade compared the past with the present. Finally, they decided to resolutely implement the production and thrift plan, lower their living standards, and each person would reduce their monthly salary by 40 jin of millet, with a total of 45 people reducing their salaries by 1,800 jin of millet.

　　六盛沟煤矿工纠队
    自动要求减资
    【本报讯】六盛沟煤矿工人纠察队，生产节约支援前线热情极高，五月份即交上支援前线款十五万余元，近见矿厂开支甚巨，经济困难，全体队员自动要求减资，范其云同志说：“日本人在观台时咱受一月才赚三斗米，（粗米）一袋面（杂的）还被克扣的得不够，解放后月资小米三百六十斤，生活提高到了天上，这是共产党毛主席给谋的福利，如今蒋介石打内战弄的咱工厂困难了，自己的工厂能不关心？我得减轻公家对我的负担。”每个同志都拿过去比了现在，最后决定坚决执行生产节约计划，降低生活水平，每人一月减工资小米四十斤，共四十五人减工资米一千八百斤。
