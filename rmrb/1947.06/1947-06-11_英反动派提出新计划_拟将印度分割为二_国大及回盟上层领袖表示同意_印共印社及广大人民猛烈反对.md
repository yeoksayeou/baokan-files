　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 9th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the British government, in order to implement its "divide and rule" policy towards India and consolidate its rule there, has recently put forward a so-called "new plan" to resolve the Indian problem. This plan has aroused fierce criticism from Indian democratic and patriotic people. Governor-General of India, Mountbatten, returned home on the 19th of last month and, after jointly consulting with the cabinet, returned to New Delhi on the 31st with the British government's plan. This plan of the British government was simultaneously announced by Attlee and Mountbatten in London and New Delhi on the 3rd of this month. In this plan, the British government proposes dividing India into two parts: Hindustan and Pakistan. Both parts would be British dominions, and the princely states would be given the freedom to decide whether to join Hindustan or Pakistan, or neither, and declare "independence". Following a meeting on the 3rd of this month between Mountbatten and the upper-level leaders of the Congress Party and the Muslim League, representatives of the Sikh religion, and representatives of the rulers of various princely states, Nehru, Jinnah, and others have expressed their willingness to accept the British government's new plan. However, this plan of the British government is being fiercely commented on by Indian society. Indian Communist leader Joshi said, "The British government's statement of June 3rd is a fierce offensive launched by the imperialists against the Indian freedom movement." Indian Socialist Party leader Narayan said, "Although the agreement of the Congress Party and the Muslim League to divide India is a fait accompli, the Socialist Party will continue to oppose the partition plan." Most Congress Party members believe that the separatists will soon understand that economically dividing India is ineffective; once religious enthusiasm subsides, India will transform into a united entity. They affirm that the British intention to create two dominions has caused great dissatisfaction, because this approach will hinder India from obtaining complete independence for a long time. The process of creating a constitution and dividing the military and financial systems will take a long time. During this long period, India will still be a dependency relying on the will of Britain. Tang Deng, leader of the Indian United Provinces National Congress, declared, "This plan betrays the interests of the Indian people, and the Indian National Congress and the entire country are heading towards a terrible misfortune." The Indian News Chronicle, in analyzing the fate of the princely states, wrote, "The interests of the people of the princely states cannot be sacrificed, and only the people have the right to decide the fate of the princely states."

　　英反动派提出新计划
    拟将印度分割为二
    国大及回盟上层领袖表示同意
    印共印社及广大人民猛烈反对
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：英国政府为贯彻其对印度“分而治之”的政策，以巩固在印统治，顷已提出所谓解决印度问题的“新计划”。此一计划已引起印度民主爱国人士的猛烈抨击。印督蒙特巴顿于上月十九日归国，与内阁共同磋商后，三十一日乃携带英政府的计划返回新德里，英政府此项计划已由艾德礼及蒙特巴顿于本月三日同时在伦敦及新德里宣布。在这一计划中，英政府建议划分印度为印度斯坦与巴基斯坦两部分，此两部分均为英国之自治领，予各土邦自行决定参加印度斯坦或巴基斯坦，或两者均不参加而宣布“独立”之自由。本月三日蒙特巴顿与国大、回盟两党上层领袖、锡克教代表及各土邦王公代表进行会谈后，尼赫鲁、金纳等已表示愿接受英政府的新计划。但英政府此项计划为印度社会人士激烈的评论着。印共领袖约希称：“英政府六月三日之声明，乃帝国主义者向印度自由运动发动之猛烈攻势。”印度社会党领袖纳约称：“国大党及回盟之同意划分印度虽为既成事实，但社会党仍将继续反对分治计划。”多数国大党党员相信：分离主义者将很快的了解在经济上分裂印度是无效的；一俟宗教热情低落时，印度的一新变为团结的。他们确言：英国制造两个自治领的意图引起极大的不满，因为这种作法会长期阻碍印度获得完全独立。创造宪法及划分军队和财政系统的进行需时甚久，在这个长期间内印度将仍是依赖英国意志的属地。印度联省国民大会领袖唐登宣称：“这个计划出卖了印度人民的利益，而印度国民大会及全国都正向着可怕的不幸走去。”印度新闻纪事报分析土邦之命运时写道：“各土邦人民的利益是不能被牺牲的，只有人民才有权决定各土邦之命运。”
