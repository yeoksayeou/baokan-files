(This dispatch from Taiyue, June 23rd) The people of Ji County held a congratulatory meeting on June 4th for a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army that liberated them. Over four thousand liberated men and women, carrying various gifts and colorful banners reading "People's Heroes, Supreme Glory," welcomed the heroes into the meeting place. When three cannon salutes sounded and more than four hundred heroes appeared on the stage, the crowd responded with enthusiastic cheers: "Welcome, meritorious People's Heroes!" After County Head Zhao spoke, eight hero representatives recounted their heroic deeds of killing the enemy. At this point, hundreds of women crowded onto the stage to present gifts and flowers to the heroes. Several elderly women with gray hair also rushed to the stage to distribute fresh zongzi and peanut cakes to the heroes, saying, "You are our saviors, this is just a small token of our appreciation!" People's Representative Lei Dengyun walked to the stage, bowed deeply to the heroes, and began to read his eulogy: "The Eighth Route Army is truly heroic, liberating Southern Shanxi like divine soldiers, saving our people from the fiery pit, committing no offenses, like living Buddhas. Wholeheartedly protecting China, winning every battle, an ever-victorious army. Your merits in Southern Shanxi will last for a thousand years, it is right and proper to comfort and congratulate you; this is just a small token of our appreciation, let us unite as soldiers and civilians and work together to completely eliminate the Chiang-Hu army." Comrade Liu Feng, a hero representative, swore to the masses on the spot: "We will continue our efforts to defend Southern Shanxi, protect everyone's land reform, and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's army!"

(This dispatch from Taiyue, June 25th) A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi held a hero's conference on the 4th of this month. More than 130 heroes attended the meeting. In addition to exchanging experiences, seven heroic models of wisdom, courage, and mutual assistance in achieving merit, including Yang Guanqing, were selected. The conference concluded successfully on the 10th. In the summary, the head of the detachment called on all officers and soldiers of the brigade to intensify their efforts to learn from the heroes in order to welcome the great counter-offensive. Model Company Commander Yang Guanqing emphasized practicality in training soldiers, often practicing setting up springboards and grenade throwing techniques in Kuangou. He conducted accurate reconnaissance before battles, developed detailed and rigorous combat plans, and was able to fully control the troops during combat, applying them freely and skillfully, and was adept at adapting to changing circumstances and turning danger into safety; in favorable situations, he was also able to avoid complacency and create new victories. Artillery hero Zhang Ziming was skilled in techniques. During the Southern Shanxi campaign, he fired a total of sixty shells, hitting the target fifty-nine times. Sapper hero Zhang Zibao successfully completed seven of the most critical and arduous blasting missions in the Southern Shanxi campaign. New soldier Ma Guangfu is a typical example of "integrating learning, application, and teaching." Only a little over ten days after enlisting, he led three new soldiers to participate in the Meiyang battle, capturing sixteen enemies; in the Yuncheng Airport battle, he captured thirty enemies. Infantry squad leader Zhou Xianjin is a typical example of leading new soldiers, all seven new soldiers in his squad achieved merit. Infantry squad leader Wang Shengming is a model political worker. His squad cultivated three squad leaders, one deputy squad leader, and one clerk; model cook Hu Zishou and others cherished the people's resources, always paid attention to economy, and produced when they had time, which improved the troops' living conditions and their relations with the masses.
