The letter roughly stated: Comrade Wang Keqin: We extend our respects to you from afar and wish you good health! On the eve of this great counter-offensive, we sincerely hope that you will tell us more about your valuable experience in mutual aid combat and educating new soldiers, so that we can make our work stronger and annihilate more enemies. Let us join hands and advance together to liberate the people of the whole country and end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule as soon as possible.
