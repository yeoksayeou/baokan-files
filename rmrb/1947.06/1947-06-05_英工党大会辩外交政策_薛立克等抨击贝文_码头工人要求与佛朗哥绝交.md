Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: According to various reports, the British Labour Party Conference in Margate began its debate on foreign policy on May 29th. The Labour Party's left wing launched a fierce attack on Bevin's foreign policy. Crossman condemned the government for violating the foreign policy resolutions passed by the Labour Party Conference prior to the 1945 general election. Crossman was particularly critical of Bevin's failure to cooperate with France and the Soviet Union on the Middle East issue. Crossman stressed that Britain should cooperate with the Soviet Union. MP Tom Driberg commented: "The general trend of our foreign policy is worrying, and many people doubt whether we are making every effort to break the deadlock between East and West, and whether we are escaping from the chaotic hysteria of American capitalism." Speaking of Spain, Driberg declared: "All these years, Franco has remained in power, and I think this is a disgrace to all of us." (The audience responded with warm applause.) He concluded: "Millions of people are unwilling to be tricked into a situation where England becomes an aircraft carrier for Wall Street to use atomic bombs, or a target for atomic bombs, or to be used against socialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS, Margate: On May 29th, a delegation representing two thousand Liverpool dockworkers, led by Jack Ward, a former member of the International Brigade who had been imprisoned by Franco, met with Bevin before the Labour Party Conference opened that day to protest the government's attitude towards Spain. Ward and two other representatives handed Bevin a petition, strongly stating that the resolutions passed by various trade union branches, etc., of the Trade Union Congress to sever all relations with Franco "remain a dead letter." The current situation is such that valuable machinery is being supplied to fascist Spain, machinery that could help build our own country, but is now only helping the fascist Franco continue his brutal rule over the Spanish people.

　　英工党大会辩外交政策
    薛立克等抨击贝文
    码头工人要求与佛朗哥绝交
    【新华社陕北一日电】据各方报导：在马盖特举行的英工党大会于五月廿九日开始关于外交政策之辩论。工党左派对贝文外交政策猛烈抨击。薛立克斯谴责政府违背一九四五年大选以前工党大会中所通过之外交政策决议。薛氏尤其对于在中东问题方面英未能与法苏合作，对贝文攻击最烈。薛氏强调英国应与苏联合作。议员托梅第堡评称：“我们外交政策的一般趋势令人忧虑，许多人怀疑我们是否正在尽各种努力以谋打开东方与西方间的僵局，我们是否正在从美国资本主义歇斯底里的混乱中逃脱出来。”说到西班牙时，托氏宣称：“这些年以来，佛朗哥仍然当权，我认为这是我们大家的耻辱。”（全场报以热烈掌声）他结论称：“数百万人民不愿意被骗到这样的境地：将英格兰变成华尔街使用原子弹的航空母舰，或投掷原子弹的目标，或者用以反对社会主义。”
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社马盖特讯：五月廿九日代表两千利物浦码头工人的代表团，以曾被佛朗哥监禁过的前国际纵队队员杰可克·瓦德为首，于工党大会该日开会前进见贝文，抗议政府对西班牙的态度。克瓦德和另外两个代表向贝文递交意见书。力称：由职工大会的各职工分会等所通过的与佛朗哥断绝一切关系的决议“仍为具文”。现在的情况是如此：就是供给法西斯西班牙以有价值的机器，这些机器本可以帮助建设我们自己的国家，但现在却只是帮助法西斯佛朗哥对西班牙人民继续他的残暴统治。
