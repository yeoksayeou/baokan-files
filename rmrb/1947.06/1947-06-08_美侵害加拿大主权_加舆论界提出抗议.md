Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 2nd: According to TASS, Ottawa: A large portion of Canadian newspapers and officials believe that, as far as Canada is concerned, Truman's attempt to establish a military bloc of Western Hemisphere nations is already a completed fact. This is because Canada has already entered the US orbit through the Joint Defense Board and is implementing military standardization according to the US model. While conservative newspapers endorse the new military alliance of Western Hemisphere nations, moderate liberals and progressive newspapers protest the US infringement on Canadian sovereignty. The most moderate liberal newspaper, the Toronto Star, stated: "The hope for world peace is based on international agreements, not agreements within a hemisphere." The Vanguard stated: "Diplomatic figures believe that Truman's statement regarding Canada puts the Canadian government in an embarrassing position because the statement reveals that, contrary to the Canadian government's denial, Canada has indeed joined the US military bloc." US military experts are training Canadian troops, US troops are engaging in training at Canadian military centers, and Canadian research on military technology is at the disposal of the United States. The Daily Tribune wrote: "The Canadian government has tied the hands and feet of the Canadian people with the Truman Doctrine, which aims to dominate the world. It is opposed by the Canadian people just as it is opposed by the American people."

　　美侵害加拿大主权
    加舆论界提出抗议
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社渥太华讯：加拿大一大部分报纸及官员认为：就加拿大而论，杜鲁门建立西半球国家军事集团的企图已经是完成的事实，因为加拿大业已通过联防委员会而走入美国的轨道，而且也正在按照美国的样式实行军备标准化。当保守的报纸赞成西半球国家的新军事同盟的时候，温和自由派及进步的报纸则抗议美国对加拿大主权的侵害。最温和自由派多伦多星报称：全世界和平的希望是基于国际的协议而不是基于半球之内的协议。先锋报称：外交界人士认为杜鲁门关于加拿大的声明使加拿大政府的地位狼狈不堪，因为该声明暴露出：与加拿大政府的否认相反，加拿大的确参加了美国的军事集团。美国的军事专家正在训练加拿大军队，美国军队正在加拿大各军事中心从事训练，而且加拿大军事技术方面的研究，是听凭美国支配的。每日论坛报写道：加拿大政府已以杜鲁门主义捆缚了加拿大人民的手足，此一主义目的在统治世界，它如同被美国人民所反对的一样，也为加拿大人民所反对。
