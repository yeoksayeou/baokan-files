　　American Newspapers Comment on the Chinese Situation
    Chiang Government's Condition is Increasingly Critical
    Chiang Party's Persecution of Newspapers and Student Movements Reveals its Weakness and Incompetence
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: American News Service reports: American newspapers have been criticizing the Chiang government's order to close three major newspapers in Shanghai and its suppression of the student anti-civil war movement. The New York Herald Tribune editorial stated: Within China's "new constitution," although there are beautiful words regarding civil liberties, three newspapers in Shanghai have already been ordered to cease publication by the government. These newspapers are accused of spreading Communist propaganda and revealing military secrets. Regarding the spreading of red propaganda, it seems to be based on these newspapers criticizing the government. The point about revealing military secrets is obviously due to the publication of news of the government's failures in the civil war. These newspapers, based on the news they carried, are no more at fault than any honest and independent Chinese newspaper should be. The charge for which these newspapers have been suspended could be applied to every publication in China that calls itself a newspaper. We find it hard to believe that those who have joined the new Chinese cabinet are all liberal figures with "reputation", how could they approve the order to close three newspapers? In the past, these cabinet members often criticized the Communists, on the grounds that the Communists did not recognize civil rights. Now, the actions in Nanjing are just like what they have been criticizing the Communists for all these years. The Christian Science Monitor editorial stated: Students at Chinese national universities have joined forces to fight for an end to the civil war. They held demonstrations despite government opposition. The Nanjing regime is still clamoring to force the CCP into submission through military means. However, the path of seeking a solution through military means has clearly failed to achieve any success. Therefore, the students' call for peace is more representative of the wishes of the Chinese people than the government authorities. The Baltimore Sun reported: The situation in China is getting worse and worse. In some large cities, excessive taxes and inflation have brought trade to a standstill. A unified China by force is becoming more and more distant. Students on strike are accused of being Communists, and more than 300 of their teachers have defended them and issued a declaration calling for an end to the civil war, but they have also taken great pains to avoid being similarly accused. Military and political authorities have closed down outspoken newspapers, dispatched military police to disrupt strikes and large-scale arrests of black market merchants. The above situation has put the Kuomintang regime in crisis, but they apparently have no intention of abandoning their goal of ruling China by force. Therefore, before treatment begins, the disease seems to be getting worse. Before we provide further assistance, before the civil war stops, we want China to have a government that obeys the public opinion of those who are currently petitioning barehanded. But unless economic and social pressures force the current regime to change or step down, such a government is unlikely to appear.

　　美国报纸评论中国情势
    蒋政府病势益危殆
    蒋党迫害报纸学运显示其脆弱无能
    【新华社陕北三十日电】美新闻处讯：美各报纸对蒋政府勒令封闭上海三大报纸及压迫学生反内战运动，纷予抨击。纽约前驱论坛报社论称：中国“新宪法”内，对于公民自由权，虽有美丽的字句，但上海已有三家报纸被政府勒令停刊。此等报纸被控为散布共产党之宣传与泄露军事秘密。关于散布赤色宣传一节，似以此等报纸指摘政府为根据。泄露军事秘密一点，则显然由于刊载政府在内战中失败之消息。此等报纸，就其所载电讯而论，并不为过，如任何中国诚实独立报纸所应有之态度。此等报纸遭受停刊处分之罪名，可能加诸中国每一被称为报纸之刊物。吾人殊难相信参加中国新内阁者均属负有“时誉”之自由派人士，何以竟核准勒令停闭三家报纸？过去此等阁员时常指责共产党，其所持理由为共产党不承认公民权利。而今南京方面之行动，正似彼等历年所斥责共产党者。基督教科学箴言报社论称：中国国立大学学生已集合力量为结束内战而奋斗。彼等不顾政府反对，举行游行示威。南京政权现仍扬言依军事迫使中共就范。但以军事谋致解决之道路，显已未能获致若何成功。故学生之呼吁和平，实较政府当局更能代表中国人民之愿望。巴尔的摩太阳报称：中国之情形愈趋恶劣，若干大城市内苛捐杂税与通货膨胀，使贸易几乎全归停滞。武力统一之中国愈益遥远。罢课之学生被指为共产党，彼等之教师三百余人，即加辩护发表宣言，呼吁停止内战，但亦煞费苦心，力避遭受同样的诬指。军政当局封闭敢言之报纸，派遣军警破坏罢课、罢工，大规模逮捕黑市商人。上述情势已令国民党政权陷入危机，但彼等显尚无意放弃武力统治中国之目标。因此，在治疗开始前，病势似乎更趋危殆。在吾人重予援助之先，在内战停止之先，吾人愿中国有一政府，顺从目前赤手空拳请愿者之民意。但除非经济与社会压力迫使目前政权变质或引退，此种政府尚无出现之可能。
