　　Speaking of “Generosity”, Mutual Aid Won’t Last Long
    Wang Zhenshan Group Studies Piece-Rate Scoring Method
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 2nd dispatch] The Wang Zhenshan mutual aid group in Quzhuang, Tunliu, is a mixed agricultural and sideline mutual aid group composed of two blacksmiths, four carpenters, and ten farmers. In the beginning, everyone was an emancipated peasant, and their enthusiasm was high. They unanimously believed that "farmers all over the world are one family, and everyone should help each other when in difficulty, regardless of each other." Therefore, it was stipulated that regardless of workers, farmers, and the level of technology, work would be recorded by the day, profits would be distributed according to work points, and meals would be eaten collectively. But as time went on, everyone started to think selfishly, and problems arose in mutual aid. For example, Duan Xiuxian led seven or eight people to Qinshui to cut branches to weave rakes, some people pretended to be sick, and some people slacked off, thinking that as long as they moved a little, they would be credited with one work point per day; Guo Lankuai only sold two rakes at the market in a day, and privately used 1,000 yuan in addition to expenses; the carpenters Liu Laoda and Liu San were very honest in their work, and could saw eight feet of planks every day; Guo Qing and Wang Zhiguo were lazy and opportunistic, and it took them a day and a half to saw four or five feet; the blacksmith Lao Yang could earn three or four dou of millet every day, but because it was calculated by daily wages and profits were distributed according to work, the work efficiency decreased day by day. The whole group has been helping each other since the first month of the lunar year, for a total of three months. In addition to agricultural labor exchange, the sideline income was 450,000 yuan. Everyone clamored to share the profits, and the workers felt that it was too disadvantageous to share the same as the farmers, and proposed a method of "scoring work according to output and distributing profits according to points," but the farmers were not satisfied. For example, Duan Xiuxian said, "It's better for us to go out and work as hired laborers than to participate in mutual aid." So the workers suggested, "If the profit distribution doesn't go well, it's better to simply break up." The people in the village all laughed and said, "It's better to be ugly first and then good than to be good first and then ugly. If you make a good plan beforehand, there wouldn't be these problems!" Now Wang Zhenshan is studying a solution to calculate work points and convert them into shares.

　　讲“涵厚”互助不长
    王镇山组研究按工评分办法
    【本报太岳二日电】屯留曲庄王镇山互助组，是由两个铁匠、四个木匠与十个农民合伙组成的一个农副业混合互助组。开始由于大家都是翻身户，热情很高，一致认为“天下农民是一家，有困难大家互助，不应分彼此”，所以规定不论工人、农民与技术高低都是按日记工，按工分红，集体吃饭。但日子一长，都打起小算盘来，互助便发生了问题。如段秀仙领了七八个人上沁源砍条编耙，有人装病，有人偷懒，认为多少动一动，每天都是记一工；郭兰魁赶集卖耙一天只卖两个，除过盘费外，又私用去一千元；木匠刘老大、刘三做活都很老实，每天拉大锯可下八尺板；郭青、王治国偷懒取巧，一天半才锯四、五尺；铁匠老杨每天可赚小米三、四斗，因为是按日计工按工批利，因此工作效率也一天比一天降低，全组从正月互助至现在整三个月，除农业变工外，副业收入四十五万元，大家嚷着要分红，工人感到和农民一样分太吃亏，提出：“按工评分按分批红”的办法来，而农民又不满意，如段秀仙说：“我们出去打忙工也比互助强。”于是工人提议：“分红闹不好就不如干脆散伙。”村里的人都笑话的说：“先好后丑不如先丑后好，事先订个好办法，那会有这些问题！”现在王镇山正研究按工评分折分解决办法。
