　　Turned My Dad's Brain Around
    Wéi Jìn
    My name is Li Xiaohu, and I am twenty-one years old. My home is in Nigouhe Village, Sixth District, Jiyuan. During the famine years, my father sent me to Qinyang to work as a servant for the bandit leader Fan Dengke. I was beaten and bullied, and I even had to empty Fan Dengke's concubine's chamber pot. Last winter, the Eighth Route Army liberated my hometown and was going to carry out land reform, so I ran back. Who knew that my father would be unhappy, saying, "I found you a good job, why didn't you do it, and what did you come back for?" I said, "I came back to get land!" My father shook his head and said, "We don't want land!" I was very surprised to hear this: My family of nine only has three or four mu of land, and we have been poor all our lives. Now that we can get land, we can turn over, so why doesn't my father want land? Later, I learned that my father was a lackey of the landlords. His idea was: "The poor rely on the rich, the rich rely on heaven, and the God of Wealth relies on immortals." He sent me to work as a servant for Fan Dengke, probably meaning this. I completely disagree with his cowardly behavior.
    My village is a border village, and armed protection is very important for land reform, so I became a militiaman. My father immediately opposed it, scolding me for being crazy and not cherishing my life! Finally, he issued a serious warning, saying, "If you want to carry a gun, get far away from here. If you enter my house, I will confiscate your gun." At that time, I thought of a way to ease the situation. I hid the gun in the wheat bran and quietly carried it out when it was my turn to be on duty.
    Land reform had just started when the enemy attacked Jiyuan City. My father gloated and said, "I told you not to be a militiaman, but you didn't listen. Watch Li Daosan come back and twist your head off!" Li Daosan is my cousin, and he is some kind of captain in the Central Army. He has already made it known that he is going to come back to settle scores. But my father's bringing up Li Daosan didn't scare me. On the contrary, the next day at the village office's wartime mobilization meeting, when discussing integrity, I was the first to swear to everyone, "Li Daosan is my brother, but I will fight him to the end if he comes back. If I compromise, may I be shot through the heart!" My father knew that I had sworn an oath, pointed at the tip of my nose, and said fiercely, "How many heads do you have?" I was also angry and said loudly, "I will fight the enemy to the end, even if it costs me my head." We argued, and finally my father asked my mother to persuade me. My mother cried and pleaded with me, and I thought, "We want to turn over! Can we fight feudalism if we can't fight the family?" I hardened my heart and ignored her.
    After the enemy occupied Jiyuan City, they were about to invade the area around my village. I wanted to go out with the militia to fight a guerrilla war. Of course, my father was unwilling. He said, "If you go out, you won't be a member of the family anymore." I said, "Do what you want!" So my father angrily went into the room, snatched the cotton-padded coat that my mother was sewing for me, and tore it into two pieces, and then tore the two pieces into four pieces...
    It was cold, and it was really freezing to fight a guerrilla war outside without a cotton-padded coat. At this time, my father listened to Li Daosan and wrote me a letter saying, "Times have changed, why suffer outside? Turn your brain around and come back. Your brother Daosan says that carrying a gun is still carrying a gun, and staying here is much better than over there." When I read the letter, I felt that it was a great insult to me. I immediately wrote back angrily, "Serving the people is worth freezing to death. Carrying the gun of the stubborn is the act of a dog." My father was very angry and wrote back, "If you don't turn back, Li Daosan will boil you in a big pot." I wrote back, "If I catch Daosan, I will put you in the big pot and use you as firewood." My father was so angry that he tore my second cotton-padded coat into pieces.
    On December 12th, to cooperate with the Eighth Route Army's attack on Jiyuan City, I led the militia home to fight Li Daosan's counter-settlement team. Running into the third courtyard south of the village, there were sounds of playing cards inside. I threw in a grenade. Li Daosan escaped in the smoke and fire. I chased him out of the village, shouting, "Slow down, didn't you say you were going to boil me in a big pot? Now let's see who gets boiled." He didn't look back and ran faster than a rabbit.
    After driving away Li Daosan's counter-settlement team, the village carried out land reform again. After the enemy's counter-settlement, the masses were afraid to do it. I led the militia to take the lead, mobilized the masses to complain, and led the masses to move things from the landlord's house, creating a strong momentum.
    The landlord Li Desheng was someone my father flattered the most. I led the masses to move things from his house, and my father was of course very angry. When he returned home that day, my father rolled up his sleeves, glared at me, and scolded, "Did Uncle Desheng offend you?"
    "No!"
    "Why did you move things from his house?"
    "He exploited the poor, and I moved back the things that belonged to the poor. Isn't that reasonable?"
    "Damn you..." My father jumped into the kitchen in anger, picked up a shovel, and beat me up. I was really angry and very sad. I thought I was leading the poor to turn over, not doing bad things, so why did my father treat me like this? My family is obviously poor, so why is my father so friendly to the landlord? I thought about it again and again, but I couldn't figure it out.
    At this time, some people advocated sending my father to the education center to change his brain, saying, "Xiaohu is a cadre who leads the poor to turn over. Attacking Xiaohu is attacking the poor's turning over." My father was pitiful, but for the sake of the poor's turning over, I couldn't give in to my father. Finally, I made up my mind and put forward my requirements: "It's okay not to send him to the education center, but he has to listen to my conditions: one is that he can't collude with the landlords and oppose the peasant association, and the other is that he can't interfere with me." Everyone told my father these conditions and persuaded him, saying, "The poor people in the village have all stood up. What future is there in siding with the landlords? You are a poor person, and you should turn over too." My father thought about it and finally agreed to my conditions. As a result of the land reform, my family was allocated seven mu of land, a kiln, and a courtyard. I became the director of the village's Armed Committee. Moving into the house, planting the land, and living a better life, my father slowly became happy. Recently, he often said to my mother, "Thanks to Xiaohu for turning my brain around, that's why we have today's good life." My mother smiled and said, "Hu'er is following Chairman Mao, not serving as a servant."
    Now, my father has also joined the peasant association.

　　扭转了俺爹的脑筋
    维进
    我叫李小虎，今年二十一岁，家在济源六区泥沟河村。灾荒年的时候，父亲把我送在沁阳给伪匪头子范登科当听差，挨打受气不说，还给范登科的姨太太倒尿盆。去年冬天八路军解放了我的家乡，要进行土地改革，我就逃跑回来。谁知父亲不高兴，说：“给你找的好好一份差事，你不干，回来干什么？”我说：“回来分土地呀！”父亲摇头说：“咱不要土地！”我听了很奇怪：我家九口人，才有三、四亩地，穷了一辈子，现在分上土地，就能翻身，为什么父亲不要土地？后来才知道父亲当了地主的狗腿。他的想法是：“穷靠富，富靠天，财神老爷靠神仙。”他把我送给范登科当听差，大概也就是这个意思。我完全不赞成他这种怕事的行为。
    我村是边沿村，要进行土地改革，武装掩护很要紧，我就当了民兵。父亲马上反对，骂我发疯，不要命！最后提出严重警告说：“你要扛枪就滚得远远的，进我的家我就要缴枪。”当时我想了一个办法，缓和了一下，把枪藏在麦糠里，轮到上岗的时候，悄悄把它扛出去。
    土地改革刚开了个头，敌人进攻济源城，父亲幸灾乐祸的说：“我叫你不要干民兵，偏不信，看李道三回来扭你的脑袋吧！”李道三是我的堂兄，在中央军干了个啥样队长，已经放出空气要回来倒算。但是父亲抬出李道三，没有把我吓住，相反第二天村公所开战时动员大会讨论到气节时，我首先向大家发誓说：“李道三是我哥，他回来我一样跟他干到底，如有妥协，刀枪穿心！”父亲知道我发誓，点着我的鼻子尖狠狠地说：“你长有几个脑袋？”我也生气了，大声说：“提着脑袋都要跟敌人干到底。”我们吵了一顿，最后父亲叫母亲劝我。母亲对我又哭又劝，我心想：“要翻身哩！斗不过家庭还能斗过封建？”硬着心没有理她。
    敌人占了济源城后，马上就要向我村这一带进犯，我想跟民兵出去打游击。当然父亲是不愿意的，他说：“你要出去，以后就不算家里的人了，我说：“随你怎么办吧！”于是父亲气愤愤的走进房里，把母亲正在给我缝的棉衣夺过来，撕成两片，两片又撕成四片……
    天气冷，在外面打游击不穿棉衣，实在冻人，这时父亲听了李道三的话，给我写信说：“时势不同了，何必在外头受苦，转过脑筋回来吧，你道三哥说，扛枪还是扛枪，待在这边比那边好的多。”我把信一看，这对我是一个极大的侮辱，马上愤愤回信说：“为人民服务，冻死也痛快，要扛顽固的枪，就是狗养的。”父亲很气，又来信说：“你不回头，李道三要大锅炸你。”我又回信说：“我抓住道三下大锅，把你当作柴火。”父亲气得没办法，把母亲给我的第二件棉衣又撕成一片片。
    十二月十二日，配合八路军进攻济源城，我领导民兵回家打李道三的倒算队，跑进村南第三座院子，里面有打牌声，扔进一颗手榴弹，李道三冒着烟火逃跑，我追出村外，喊着：“走慢点，你不是说大锅炸我，现在看炸谁吧。”他头也不回，跑的比兔子还快。
    打走李道三的倒算队，村里又进行土地改革，经过敌人一次倒算，群众都不敢干。我领导民兵带头干，发动群众诉苦，带领群众到地主家里搬东西，搞的一股劲。
    地主李德生是父亲最奉承的一个人，我领导群众到他家搬东西，父亲当然很生气，当天回到家里，父亲卷起袖子瞪着眼骂道：“德生叔得罪了你？”
    “没有！”
    “为什么搬他家的东西？”
    “他剥削穷人，我搬回穷人的东西，这还不合理？”
    “日你娘呀………”父亲气得跳进厨房，拿起铁锹，把我打了一顿。我真生气，又很伤心，我想我领导穷人翻身，不是办坏事，为什么父亲这样对我，家里明明是穷光蛋，为什么父亲和地主这样相好？我想了又想，想不通。
    这时有人主张将我父亲送到教育所换脑筋，说：“小虎是领导穷人翻身的干部，他打击小虎，就是打击穷人翻身。”父亲本是很可怜的，但是为了穷人翻身，我不能向父亲让步，最后拿定主意，提出我的要求说：“不送教育所也算，要听我的条件：一个是不能跟地主勾勾搭搭，反对农会，再一个不能干涉我。”大家把这个条件告诉父亲，并且劝解他说：“村里穷人都干起来了，跟地主一世还有什么出路？你是穷人，也该翻身了。”父亲想了想，终于答应了我的条件。土地改革结果，我家分了七亩地，一座窑，一座院。我当了村里武委会主任。搬进房，种上地，日子好过了，父亲慢慢高兴起来。近来常对母亲说：“多亏小虎扭转我的脑筋，才有今天的光景。”母亲笑着说：“虎儿奉的毛主席，没奉差。”
    现在，父亲也参加农会了。
