　　General Chen Yi's Recent Work:
    A Song of Central Shandong
    General Chen Yi, Commander of the East China People's Liberation Army, while leading the East China people's patriotic self-defense war amidst the hustle and bustle of military affairs, recently composed four poems, "A Song of Central Shandong," as follows:

  I. On the Road Between Linyi and Mengyin (Like a Dream Tune)

    Linyi, Mengyin, Xintai,
    The road turns, peaks twist, rocks are strange,
    A beautiful scene,
    Seventy-two fortified hills are lovable.
    Lovable, lovable,
    Chiang's army's attack is bound to fail!

  II. The Great Victory of Laiwu

    The battlefields of Zibo and Laiwu are stained with red,
    Our army hunts the enemy again east of Mount Tai.
    Hundreds of millions capture wolves and tigers,
    Seventy-two fortified hills record valiant deeds.
    Snow clears over central Shandong, flags flutter,
    Waves of the Bohai Sea sing a mighty song.
    We laugh at the days when the warlord was bound and ashamed,
    Kowtowing to beg forgiveness, cursing Chiang Kai-shek's villainy.

  III. Capture of Tai'an

    Recapturing Tai'an is good for the war,
    The enemy regrets not breaking out earlier.
    Nanjing, Chiang, and the Americans are even more anxious,
    The key offensive has failed again.

  IV. Battle of Menglianggu

    Ghosts and gods howl on Menglianggu,
    The 74th Division has nowhere to escape.
    Signal lights twinkle like stars,
    Illumination everywhere, like a tide of fire.
    Hand-to-hand combat to seize the summit,
    Shelling, blood soaks battle robes.
    Chiang's bandit's main force is now annihilated,
    Every soldier of our army is a hero.

    Every soldier of our army is a hero,
    Even the reactionary ace cannot escape.
    Chiang's bandit's tyranny is pitifully fated,
    American imperialism's aggression is in vain.

    The turning point on the East China battlefield is here,
    The Yimeng Mountain area is even more solid.
    We rejoice even more as the timely rain hastens the ripening of wheat,
    The day of victory is near, we rejoice!

　　陈毅将军近作：
    鲁中吟
    华东人民解放军司令员陈毅将军，指挥华东人民爱国自卫战争，戎马倥之际，近作鲁中吟四首，如下：
  一、临沂蒙阴道中（如梦令）。
    临沂、蒙阴、新泰，路转峰回石怪，一片好风景，七十二崮堪爱。堪爱，堪爱，蒋军进攻必败！
  二、莱芜大捷
    淄博莱芜战血红，我军又猎泰山东，百千万众捉狼虎，七十二崮志伟功。鲁中雪霁照旌旗，渤海波澜唱大风，堪笑豪帅面缚日，叩头请罪骂蒋凶。
  三、攻克泰安
    夺回泰安战局好，敌人突围恨不早，南京蒋美更焦急，重点进攻又败了。
  四、孟良崮战斗
    孟良崮上鬼神号，七十四师无地逃，信号点点星灿烂，照明处处火如潮。
    短兵肉搏争山顶，炮击血飘湿战袍，蒋贼主力今歼灭，我军个个是英豪。
    我军个个是英豪，反动王牌亦难逃，蒋贼专横嗟命薄，美帝侵略徒空劳。
    华东战场今转捩，沂蒙山区更固牢，更喜急雨催麦熟，胜利日近乐陶陶。
