　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS Vienna dispatch: The committee composed of representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France began work here on May 12. In accordance with the instructions of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, this committee is to review the unagreed articles in the Austrian treaty and submit a report to the Foreign Ministers Conference. Since the meeting began, no articles of the Austrian treaty have been discussed. The eleven meetings have been wasted on discussing meaningless procedural issues. This is due to the attitude of the American representative, Dodge. In this regard, he is supported by the British representative Mack and the French representative Charier, and is trying to make the work of the meeting proceed along a different line from that stipulated by the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. According to the resolution of the Moscow Conference, the committee was instructed to review all unresolved issues in the Austrian treaty. As is well known, one of the most important unresolved issues is Article 35 of the Austrian treaty regarding German assets in Austria, and Article 42 of the treaty regarding the property of the United Nations and its peoples in Austria. In accordance with the resolution passed at the Potsdam Conference, the transfer of German assets in eastern Austria to the Soviet Union as one of the sources of payment for Soviet reparations from Germany would not be in the interests of Dodge and the financiers he represents. Among them, the first are the Anglo-American oil companies. At some point, the deeds of these companies were handed over to the Germans, and the US and British governments did not object. During the war, Germany actually needed oil and invested a lot of capital in the Austrian oil industry. Now, the former American and British owners, supported by the Austrians in this regard, are trying to seize German investments in the Austrian oil industry and harm the Soviet Union's rights already recognized by the Potsdam Conference; the British and American sides have turned to support the Austrian owners. The latter engaged in various transactions with the Germans after the German-Austrian merger and made huge profits by transferring their ownership to the Germans. Now these Austrian businessmen are demanding this ownership again. All these circumstances are aimed at nullifying the Potsdam Conference's resolution on transferring German assets in eastern Austria to the Soviet Union. Dodge and the British and French representatives do not seek to resolve the work entrusted to the committee by the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, but instead try to transform the committee and its affiliated expert committee into tools for revising the joint resolutions passed by the Allies, a revision that is compliant with the interests of the American and British oil companies and the Austrian capitalists who served the Germans during the German-Austrian merger.

### 美国掠取德在奥石油投资  对奥四国委会无进展

　　美国掠取德在奥石油投资
    对奥四国委会无进展
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社维也纳讯：由苏、美、英、法四国代表所组成的委员会，于五月十二日在此间开始工作；遵照莫斯科外长会议之训令，此一委员会是要来审议奥国和约中尚未协议之各条款，并向外长会议提出报告。开会以来，从未讨论到奥国和约之任何条款。在十一次的会议中，只是耗费在无谓的程序问题的讨论上。这是由于美国代表道奇的态度所致。在这方面，他受到英代表麦克及法代表柴瑞尔的支持，而且正在力图使会议的工作沿着与莫斯科外长会议所规定的不同路线进行。遵照莫斯科会议的决议，委员会是被训令来审议奥国和约尚未协议之一切问题。如所周知，最重要的未获协议的问题之一，是奥国和约三十五条关于德国在奥资产，及该约第四十二条关于联合国及其各国人民的在奥财产问题。遵照波茨顿会议所通过的决议，德国在奥国东部的资产转移给苏联，作为苏联自德国应获赔偿的支付来源之一，这是不会合于道奇及其所代表的金融家们之利益的。在他们中间，首先便是英美的石油公司。在某个时期，这些公司的契据交给了德国人，而美英政府未提出反对。在战争期间，德国实际上需要石油，而且在奥地利的石油工业中投下了大量的资本。现在，从前的美英所有主们在这方面受到奥地利人的支持，企图掠取德国在奥国石油工业中的投资，而来损害波茨顿会议已经承认的苏联的权利；英美方面又转过来支持奥国的所有主们。后者在德奥合并后与德国人从事各种交易，而以转让他们的所有权给德国人而获得巨利。现在这些奥国的生意人，又要求这种所有权了。所有这些情形，其目的是使波茨顿会议有关把奥国东部之德国资产转移给苏联的决议化为乌有。道奇以及英法代表不力求解决莫斯科外长会议所委托给委员会的工作，反而亟图转变委员会及其附属之专家委员会成为修改盟国所通过的联合决议的工具，这种修改是顺从着美英石油公司及在德奥合并时期服务德人的奥国资本家的利益。
