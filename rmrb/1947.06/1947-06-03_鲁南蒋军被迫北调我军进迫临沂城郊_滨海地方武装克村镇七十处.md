　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 1st—After the East China People's Liberation Army annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division, the enemy was forced to move the two brigades of the 64th Division and one brigade of the 20th Division from southern Shandong northward to the Xintai and Mengyin areas, thus further weakening the enemy's forces in southern Shandong. At present, Baiyan, the central town in the mountainous area, is free of enemy troops, and only a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet He Zhibin remains in Chengqian (90 li northeast of Teng County). Only one battalion each of Chiang Kai-shek's Feng Zhi'an's troops are stationed in Liangqiu and nearby Machang. People's armed forces are approaching the outskirts of Linyi and are attacking Chiang Kai-shek's puppet return corps everywhere in the vast areas south to Tancheng, Matou, and south of the Lin (Yi) Fei (County) highway. Another unit of local armed forces is actively operating south of Chengqian and Baiyan, and north of Zaozhuang and Qicun. The area east of Linziz (Linyi to Ziyang), from Difang (30 li west of Feixian) to Bianqiao (45 li east of Sishui), is controlled by the people's armed forces. The mountainous area south of Sishui and Difang remains the base area of the people's armed forces. The entire mountainous area is gradually recovering. The main forces and local armed forces in southern Shandong have annihilated more than 710 enemy troops in the past ten days (May 4th to 13th).
    Xinhua News Agency, East China, 31st—(Delayed) During the Menglianggu campaign, local armed forces in the coastal area, in coordination with the battle, advanced towards Linyi city and the highway of more than 80 li from Lin (Yi) Tan (Cheng) and Lin (Yi) Tang (Tou) starting from the 16th, liberating 70 important villages and towns such as Xiangongji in Linyi, and repulsing the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops several times. At present, the working teams advancing directly westward have remotely seen the top of the Martyrs' Tower in Linyi city.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 1st—Among the captured Chiang Kai-shek army officers of the 74th Division in the Battle of Menglianggu, it has now been ascertained that Major General Chen Fujun, Brigade Commander of the 51st Brigade, Colonel He Yizhang, Deputy Brigade Commander of the 58th Brigade, Colonel Xie Qichang, Regimental Commander of the 152nd Regiment of the 51st Brigade, Lieutenant Colonel Xie Qichang, Deputy Regimental Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Cheng Jia, Deputy Regimental Commander of the 173rd Regiment of the 58th Brigade, and Colonel Zhao Jianguo, Chief Secretary of the News Department and Acting Deputy Director of the division, are also among them.

　　鲁南蒋军被迫北调我军进迫临沂城郊
    滨海地方武装克村镇七十处
    【新华社山东一日电】华东人民解放军歼蒋军七十四师后，敌被迫将鲁南之六十四师两个旅及二十师一个旅北调至新泰、蒙阴一带，因此鲁南敌之兵力更加空虚。现山区中心重镇之白彦已无敌踪，城前（滕县城东北九十里）仅余蒋伪何志斌一部。梁邱及其附近之马厂，仅驻蒋军冯治安部各一个营。人民武装则逼近临沂近郊，并在南至郯城、马头及临（沂）费（县）公路以南之广大地区内，到处打击蒋伪还乡团。另一部地方武装则在城前、白彦以南，枣庄、齐村以北积极活动。临滋（临沂到滋阳）东起地方（费县西三十里），西至卞桥（泗水东四十五里）已为人民武装控制。泗水、地方以南之山区仍为人民武装之根据地。目前整个山区正逐渐恢复中。鲁南主力、地方武装近十天（五月四日至十三日）歼敌七百一十余名。
    【新华社华东三十一日电】（迟到）滨海区地方武装配合孟良崮大战，自十六日起向临沂城及临（沂）郯（城）、临（沂）汤（头）八十余华里的公路上挺进，解放临沂相公集等七十余重要村镇，数次打退出犯蒋军，现向西直进的武工队已遥见临沂城烈士塔顶。
    【新华社华东前线一日电】孟良崮之战蒋军七十四师被俘军官中，刻查明五十一旅少将旅长陈傅钧，五十八旅上校副旅长贺翊章，五十一旅一五二团上校团长谢岂常，少校团副谢其昌，五十八旅一七三团中校副团长程嘉及该师新闻处上校秘书主任代理副处长赵建功亦在内。
