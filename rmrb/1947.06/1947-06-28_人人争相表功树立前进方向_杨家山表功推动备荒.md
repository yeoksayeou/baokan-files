Everyone Competes to Claim Merit and Establish a Direction for Advancement
    Yangjiashan's Merit-Claiming Promotes Famine Preparations

    [This newspaper's Shexian Dispatch] The Yangjiashan area in the first district has launched a mass merit-claiming and evaluation movement. Everyone's slogan is: Everyone has contributed to resisting Japan and fighting Chiang, if you have merit, claim it, not claiming it is shameful. Old man Yang Shuting said: "I didn't hold a position as a cadre before, but I carried grain on stone slabs. I wasn't afraid of the cold and I personally sorted the grain. I sorted more than 500 *shi* in one night, not sleeping, to load grain for the masses, so that they could return earlier. I obey the leadership of the cadres and completed all kinds of tasks. This is my great contribution." Yang Shouchun said: "I was very firm in the struggle against landlords and secret agents, and this is also my contribution."

    Under their influence, cadres and the masses competed to talk about their historical contributions. The discussions in each street were very lively. After two evenings, everyone in the village talked about their merits, compared their conditions, and elected a merit evaluation committee to evaluate the masses of the whole village into seven grades: six special grades, nine first grades, sixteen second grades, twenty third grades, thirty-three fourth grades, thirty fifth grades, one hundred and six sixth grades, and twenty-three seventh grades, and ten women. The merit list was posted on the main street and unanimously approved by the masses after discussion. This also moved comrades with shortcomings to examine themselves. Yang Heshun said: "I have malaria." Yang Buchang said: "I was corrupt and the masses opposed it. I will resolutely overcome it before 'July 1st'." On June 19th, the whole village held a merit celebration meeting. There was a merit room, with a portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the middle, surrounded by pictures of debt clearing, rent reduction, and anti-traitor plots, as well as model stories of textile work, joining the army, cultivating land for others, transporting grain, fighting locusts, borrowing grain, and disaster relief, etc. There were also merit plaques. The meeting was very lively.

    After the men and women, old and young, of the whole village entered the venue, the villagers competed to look at the merit list and the history of struggle. After the music started, the chairman read out the merit list. The village chief said: "Today we are holding a merit celebration meeting to summarize our ten years of hard struggle, so that everyone can understand that only if we ourselves have won the world can we live this good life." Then everyone began to freely claim merit. Yang Tukun, the director of the Farmers' Association, said: "I started to lead the masses to struggle against the landlord Yang Fushan. I stayed at the homes of the long-term workers and returned to the meeting at night to discuss the struggle, and returned early in the morning, traveling more than ten *li*. I was very active in every struggle, and these are all my contributions. I also have some shortcomings, which are subjective, stubborn, and undemocratic. I will give a gift to the Party on 'July 1st', and I will resolutely overcome them, follow the mass line, and transform my style." More than one hundred people competed to claim merit at the meeting. Everyone felt happy. After the meeting that night, each street set out a plan for thrift and production, deciding that each household would dry-plant two *mu* of grain, chop fifty *jin* of vegetables, and change rice to porridge. Everyone was determined to do a good job in famine preparations and strive to compare merits on "July 1st" and give gifts to the Party. (Zhao Wen, Qing Rong)

　　人人争相表功树立前进方向
    杨家山表功推动备荒
    【本报涉县讯】一区杨家山开展群众性的表功评功运动，大家的口号是：抗日打蒋，人人有功，有功就表，不表丢人。杨书亭老汉说：“我先前不担任干部，到石板上驮粮，我不怕天冷，一人排斗，一夜排五百多石，不睡觉给群众装粮，为叫群众早些回来。我服从干部领导，各样工作都完成了任务，这是我的大功劳。”杨寿春说：“我对地主特务斗争很坚决，这也是我的功劳。”
    在他两人的影响下，干部群众争先恐后的谈自己的历史功劳。各街讨论劲头很大。经两黄昏全村人都说自己功劳，比条件，选举评功委员会把全村群众评了七等，特等六名，一等九名，二等十六名，三等二十名，四等三十三名，五等三十名，六等一百○六名，七等二十三名，妇女十名，把功劳榜贴在大街上经群众讨论一致通过。这样又感动了有缺点的同志检讨自己，杨和顺说：“我犯冷热病。”杨步昌说：“我有腐化，群众反对，‘七一’前坚决克服掉。”六月十九日全村开了贺功大会，设备有功劳室，中间挂着毛主席像，周围挂着清债、减租、反奸图画及纺织、参战、代耕、运粮、打蝗、借粮、救灾等的模范故事等，还有功劳匾，会场很热闹。
    全村男女老少进了会场后，老乡们都争着看功劳名单及斗争历史。奏乐开会后主席宣读了功劳名单，村长说：“咱今天开的贺功大会，把咱们十年的艰苦斗争总结一下，大家就可以明白只有咱们自己打下天下，才能过这好时光”，接着每个人就开始自由表功，农会主任杨土昆同志说：“我开始领导群众斗争杨福善地主，我在前＠住长工，黑夜回来开会讨论斗争，天明还回去，来回走十几里路。各个斗争中都很积极，这都是我的功劳。我还有些缺点，是主观、圪扭脾气，不民主，到‘七一’给党送礼，我坚决克服，走群众路线，转变我的作风。”大会上争抢着表功的就有一百多人。人人都觉得高兴。会后当晚，各街均订出节约生产计划，决定每户干种谷二亩，打菜五十斤，米饭改成稀饭，大家一心搞好备荒，争取“七一”比功劳给党献礼。（赵文、庆荣）
