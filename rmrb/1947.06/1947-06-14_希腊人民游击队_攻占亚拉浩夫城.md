Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: According to TASS, Athens: The recent attacks by Greek guerrillas on large strongholds and the intensification of activities in areas that were officially declared "cleared" during the spring offensive have caused serious fear among the ruling groups. Since May 31st, military and political authorities have been constantly meeting to discuss the current domestic situation, painstakingly formulating new measures to deal with the guerrillas. One decision has been officially announced, namely, to strengthen the army's forces and equipment. Newspapers report that the United States has agreed to increase the army to 50,000 men. This decision is generally seen as an acknowledgment of the fact that a peacetime army cannot prevent the expansion of the guerrilla movement. It is reported that among other measures, the government is attempting to extend martial law to major cities and carry out mass arrests in order to deprive the guerrillas of the opportunity to obtain assistance from urban residents.
　　[Another Dispatch] A report from Kalamata states that more than two hundred Greek guerrillas are active in the area of Mount Taygetus in the southern Peloponnese. On the morning of the 6th, they attacked the gendarmerie company stationed in the village of Pinnagitsha, killing 30 and wounding 5 gendarmes. On the evening of the 4th, Captain Dianos led guerrillas to capture Arachova City in the Letya region south of Mount Batmas. Battles and clashes between guerrillas and government forces continue in the Nagusya region on the north coast of Corinth. Guerrillas in the Pirian Mountains northeast of Koro and in Macedonia have occupied the village of Karaneida, only two kilometers from the city of Katrin.

　　希腊人民游击队
    攻占亚拉浩夫城
    【新华社陕北十日电】据塔斯社雅典讯：希腊游击队最近袭击大的据点，并在官方公报中说是在春季攻势中已完全“萧清”了的地区加强活动，已引起了统治集团的严重恐惧。自五月三十一日以来，军事及政治当局不断集会讨论国内当前形势。煞费苦心地制定对付游击队的新办法。有一个决定已经官方公布，即加强陆军兵力及其装备。报纸报导：对于增加陆军到五万名，美国已同意。一般视此决定对下一事实的承认，即和平时期的陆军不能防止游击运动的扩大。据息：在其他的办法中，政府企图将戒严令扩展到各大城市，大批捕人，以便剥夺游击队从城市居民中获得援助的机会。
    【又讯】来自卡拉马塔之报导称，二百多希腊游击队员，在摩里亚半岛南部泰吉山一带活动。六日晨，袭击驻在萍那吉特沙村的宪兵连，宪兵死三十名，伤五名。四日晚，戴亚诺德队长率领游击队攻占了巴特马山南部列特亚地区的亚拉浩夫城。游击队和政府军之间的战斗和冲突仍然在科林斯国北岸那圭斯亚地区进行中，在寇罗东北的皮里安山及麦士顿尼亚的游击队，已占领了距卡特林城仅二公里之卡拉涅打村。
