Grasp Tightly to Meet the Demands of the Masses
    Wheat Fields Distributed in the New District of Linzhang
    [This newspaper’s report from Southern Hebei, 13th] The mass movement in the newly recovered district of Linzhang is advancing from points to the whole area, carrying out armed anti-espionage activities on one hand, and distributing wheat fields on the other. This area has been under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet regime for many years, and the landlords in all villages have connections with bandits and reactionaries, cruelly oppressing the poor masses. Except for one or two big landlord households in each village, almost all are tenant farmers and poor peasants. For example, in Nanying, the sixth district, 39 out of 40 households are tenant farmers, ruled by one big landlord. In Zuo Village, the second district, 30 households own only 96 mu of land. In the Shen clan area of the first district, 50 households in one village owe more than 50 million yuan in foreign debt to landlords in other villages. The broad masses are not only living in poverty, but also have no political freedom whatsoever. The special agent organizations controlled by the landlords constantly carry out small-scale activities. For example, in Village X in the western part of the third district, when our work team from the eighth sub-district went to confiscate guns, a group of special agents openly resisted with arms. There are also those who secretly infiltrated the militia to carry out sabotage. Since the work team arrived in the area, widespread propaganda has been carried out, resolutely suppressing evil forces and eliminating special agent organizations, openly calling for the organization of peasant associations, emphasizing the unity of middle and poor peasants to stand up and liberate themselves, and seizing the opportunity to resolve the urgent demands of the masses - the distribution of wheat fields belonging to landlords. Since the large-scale mobilization in Chuwang, the first district, more than ten villages including Nangou Village, Fanli, and Zhang Village have enabled the majority of middle and poor peasants to participate in peasant associations, detained the treacherous and tyrannical landlords, and completed the distribution of confiscated wheat fields. Signs have been erected everywhere, inscribed with "Village X confiscated X mu of wheat fields from treacherous and tyrannical landlord X, Committee for Distributing Wheat in Village X."

　　抓紧满足群众要求
    临漳新区分麦田
    【本报冀南十三日电】临漳新收复区群众运动由点向面推进，一面进行武装反特，一面进行分麦田。该地区在蒋伪统治多年，各村地主都与匪顽有关系，对贫苦群众压榨极其残酷，一村除一、二户大地主外，都是佃户贫农；如六区南营四十户三十九家是佃户，被一家大地主统治着。二区左庄三十户人家只有九十六亩地。一区申氏一带一村五十户欠外村地主外债五千万元以上。广大群众不但生活贫苦，政治上更无半点自由，地主掌握的特务组织不断出现小股活动，如三区西部×村，我八分区工作团去起枪，一股特务即公开武装抵抗。另外还有秘密打入民兵中进行破坏者。自工作队到达该地后，普遍进行了宣传，坚决镇压邪气及扫清特务组织，公开号召组织农会，强调中贫农团结翻身，并抓紧解决群众迫切要求——分配地主麦田。一区自楚旺大动后，南北沟村、范里、张庄等十余村作到大多数中贫农参加农会，扣起了奸霸地主，并已分配完没收的麦田，各地边竖起了牌子，上书“×村没收×奸霸麦田×亩，×村分麦委员会”。
