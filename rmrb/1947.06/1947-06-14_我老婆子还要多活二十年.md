　　I, This Old Woman, Want to Live Another Twenty Years
　　Gao Shuji
　　We were helping Old Woman Liu harvest wheat in Xiqugou, and we chatted as we harvested.
　　"The first big landlord in our Xigou was Liu Chen. His eldest son is called 'Old Miser.' The poor people gave him that nickname. I, this old woman, have lived in Xiqugou for over fifty years and don't even know his real name. Old Miser, Old Miser, he really is a miser!
　　"The year before last, when our Eighth Route Army hadn't arrived yet, I harvested wheat for him. He promised six dollars a day. I harvested for several days, my back ached and my arms were sore, but when it came to settling the account, he was a deadbeat and only gave me three dollars… I, this old woman, don't have a single plot of land. I heard that the Eighth Route Army was coming to distribute land to the poor, and I was so happy that sometimes I couldn't even sleep. I kept thinking about dividing Old Miser's land first. This son of a bitch, we'll settle accounts with him in the future. Even if you brought in one or two thousand people who could write and calculate, you still wouldn't be able to figure it out. Look at all this golden land, it's all what he squeezed from the poor people.” She pointed casually.
　　I stood up and looked, there were about six or seven *qing* of land.
　　“Comrade! Now it all belongs to the poor people. I never had a handful of soil in my life, and now I have land too. The year before last I harvested wheat on this plot of land, I was harvesting for others; this year I'm on this plot of land again, harvesting for myself. In the past, when I harvested wheat, I frowned, but this year, when I harvest wheat, I smile…” As she spoke, she chuckled. Then she continued:
　　"Comrade! With you here, I want to live another twenty years.” I smiled. The old woman continued immediately, “Don’t laugh, in previous years I always said that I wouldn’t live for many more days. But this year, you've come, and to tell you the truth – I feel comfortable every day, it's just different. I, this old woman, will definitely live another twenty years.”

　　我老婆子还要多活二十年
    高树基
    我们在西曲沟帮助刘老太太割麦时，边割边谈起来。
    “俺西沟第一个大老财就是刘辰，他大儿子叫‘老刻子’，这个外号是穷人们给他叫起来的。我老婆子在西曲住了五十多年就不知到他的正名儿，老刻子，老刻子，真能刻薄人啊！
    “前年个咱们八路军还没有来的时候，我给他割麦子。交代的是一天六块钱，割了好几天，腰疼胳膊酸的，算帐的时候他死赖皮，只给三块钱………。我老婆子一分地都没有，听说八路军来了给穷人分地，我高兴的有时候连觉也睡不着了，老是盘算着先分老刻子的地，这狗日的将来算帐，请来千二八百个能写会算的人也算不清，你看这一片黄涯涯的都是他刻薄的穷人的。”她随手一指。
    我立起来一看，总有六七顷地。
    “同志！现在都成了穷人的了，我一辈子没有一把土，现在也有了地，前年割麦子就在这块地里，是给人家割；今年又在这块地里，是给自己割。往年割麦子愁眉苦脸，今年割麦子喜眉笑眼……”说着说着他格格地笑起来。接着又说：
    “同志！有你们在，我还要活廿年。”我笑了笑。老人家紧接着说：“你别笑，年时个我嘴里老是说活不了几天了，今年你们来了，说老实话——天天心里舒坦就不一样，我老婆子就是能够多活二十年。”
