Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 6th: Newspapers in Beiping and Tianjin report that Zhou Binglin, Chen Daisun, Mei Yibao, Li Shaoxi, Chen Xujing, and more than five hundred and eighty other professors from eight universities, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Normal University, Sino-French University, Art Academy, Nankai University, and Beiyang University, issued a declaration on the current situation on May 28th. It began by stating: "In recent weeks, prices have soared continuously, and people are extremely uneasy. Disturbances have occurred continuously in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and various provinces and cities, with citizens抢米 (literally "snatching rice," meaning rioting over rice shortages), workers striking, and students boycotting classes, creating dangerous situations. If this continues, we don't know where it will end." It also stated: "The perilousness of the situation is unmatched even by the eve of the French Revolution or the Russian October Revolution." The declaration believes that the root cause of this crisis is the Chiang Kai-shek government's initiation and insistence on the civil war. The only way to save the crisis is to establish a democratic coalition government in accordance with the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) line. The declaration said: "We deeply know that the root cause of all the disturbances today lies in the economic crisis. And the economic crisis is the consequence of the prolonged civil war. All labor strikes and student strikes are inevitable products of the current situation. Observing the current situation, whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or culture, all are on the verge of collapse, and the crisis is imminent. Continuing the war will not solve the difficulties but will only cause greater difficulties." According to reports, the declaration is still being signed after its publication.

　　平津六百大学教授
    反对蒋党内战独裁
    【新华社陕北六日电】平津各报载：北大、清华、燕大、师院、中法、艺专、南开、北洋等八校教授周炳琳、陈岱荪、梅贻宝、黎邵熙、陈序经等五百八十余人，五月二十八日发表对时局宣言，首称：“最近数旬中物价连续暴涨，人心极度不安，京沪平津及各省市不断发生骚动，市民抢米，工人罢工，学生罢课，险象环生；长此以往，不知将伊于胡底。”又称：“形势之险恶，即法国之大革命、俄国十月革命之前夜，亦无过之。”宣言认为，这个危机的根源是蒋介石政府发动内战并坚持内战的结果。挽救危机的唯一出路，就是依照政协路线成立民主的联合政府。宣言说：“同人等深知今日一切纷扰现象根源，胥起于经济危机。而经济危机，则又为长期内战之后果。一切工潮、学潮，均为当前时势下必然之产物。默察当前形势，无论政治、军事、经济、文化，俱已临于崩溃之边缘，危机迫于眉睫；继续战争绝不能解决困难，而只有引起更大之困难。”据报载：这个宣言在发表以后，仍在继续签名中。
