　　[This Newspaper] All Personnel in Military Direct Production Departments
    Further Reduce Living Standards
    Cadres in Various Local Organs Continue to Practice Economy and Prepare for Hard Times
    [This Newspaper Reports] The units of the production departments directly under the military region have further reduced their living standards and are saving grain to prepare for hard times. Since the last call for "intensifying economy to overcome difficulties," all personnel have voluntarily reduced their living standards. According to preliminary statistics, a total of 420,000 yuan (in silver dollars) has been saved from wages, allowances, clothing, shoes, and socks. In addition, daily rations were reduced by six liang (approximately 300 grams) of rice per person. After the call to increase production and achieve meritorious service, various units voluntarily proposed to further reduce living standards. The farm changed to eating noodles every three days, the Xinhua Store to every other day, the Wanlong Oil Workshop to once every seven days, all cadres, apprentices, and administrative staff to once every two days, workers in the felt hat department voluntarily to once every three days, and the Yuhua Factory also to once every three days. It is estimated that 20,000 yuan (in silver dollars) can be saved every day. Various units are also engaging in "sparrow warfare" by planting vegetables and raising pigs to solve part of the vegetable supply and to avoid buying meat all year round.
    [This Newspaper Reports] In order to combat drought, prepare for hard times, and welcome the great counter-offensive, a widespread movement of production, economy, and donation is underway in various places. The *Hebei-Shandong-Henan Daily* responded to the call of Comrade Zhang Linzhi of the District Party Committee and announced that helping the masses with production through economy would be one of the criteria for evaluating merit in the newspaper office. After the call was issued, comrades from various sections competed to donate allowances, money, and clothing. After the General Merit Evaluation Committee commended the Telecommunications Section and the Proofreading Section, the entire newspaper office entered a surge of donation. In addition to donating money, saving clothing, and allowances, the comrades in the Editorial Department also stopped eating supper. The Telecommunications Section launched a second donation campaign, and one comrade donated his American milk goat, repeatedly instructing that it be given to wounded comrades. From May 30th to June 3rd, in four days, 113 people participated in the movement (accounting for 70% of the entire newspaper office), donating cash, clothing, and savings totaling 1,451,197 yuan (in silver dollars).

    All comrades in the Taihang Second Sub-bureau of Industry and Commerce have achieved remarkable results through production, economy, and hard work. In terms of agricultural production, Zhang Fuxian and other comrades pulled carts and pushed manure instead of livestock during the planting rush, plowing 6.4 mu (approximately 1.06 acres) of land. In this stage, a total of 300 loads of manure were delivered, 6.4 mu of land were plowed, 1.2 mu of land were reclaimed, and 1 mu of vegetable garden was planted, and they are now able to achieve self-sufficiency in vegetables. At the same time, they are also diligent and thrifty in reducing their living standards. They have not eaten meat for two months, and white flour has been reduced to once a week. The vegetable budget has also been reduced from 50 yuan to 37 yuan per day. Responsible comrades also share the hardships with everyone without exception. Within two months, 600 jin (approximately 300 kg) of coal were saved. After changing kerosene lamps to sesame oil lamps, another 5.7 liang (approximately 285 grams) of sesame oil were saved, and 13,155 yuan of office expenses were saved, accounting for one-third of the office expenses. All comrades are now discussing specific ways to deepen economy and prevent famine. (Jing Fang, Nai He)
    Zhou, the director of the National Salvation Association of Linqing County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, Secretary Zhao, and correspondent Zhang Hanzhi, donated allowances and shoes and socks. All cadres and miscellaneous personnel donated a total of 79,000 yuan. Director Yang of the Seventh Sub-district Post Office saved 500 jin of millet. All teachers in the First District of Guangzong responded by economizing on food and clothing to support the front lines. Wu Yuelin and 39 others donated 1,460 jin of rice. County-level organs in Ningnan County supported a total of 5,800 jin of rice. (*Hebei-Shandong-Henan Branch*)
