[This dispatch from Lu Cheng] Gu Zhang summarized the sowing campaign and evaluated models, allowing the masses to recognize the benefits of mutual aid from their own personal experiences. Old Du from Fourth Street said, "In the past, I only farmed five mu of land, and I was busy all year round but still couldn't farm it well. After the turn over last year, I was allocated more than ten mu of land and half a head of livestock. This year, with mutual aid, my land was plowed deeply and harrowed evenly. Now, the sturdy seedlings are growing." Chen Layu said, "I was completely an amateur at farming, but this year I participated in mutual aid. The land was farmed well, and I also learned some farming skills. I benefited from mutual aid." Chen Wanqing said, "I have eight mu of paddy fields that I haven't been able to cultivate for several years. My individual strength was too small, and before the crops could be planted, the fields would be flooded. This year, with mutual aid, there are many people and great strength, so we planted them early. Chairman Mao's call for mutual aid in production is really good." Tao Xiaohai's son is a militiaman who went to war. He returned home from the Wangyang coal mine and was surprised to see the land planted. The cadre told him that it was planted by the mutual aid group. He happily said, "Mutual aid is effective. I wouldn't worry even if my son didn't come back from the war for another three months." Li Jianwen, a lazy man who did not participate in mutual aid, regretted it very much, saying, "I used to think that mutual aid was just making noise together. I am not very good at doing housework, and I was afraid that participating in mutual aid would be inconvenient. Now that everyone has sown their seeds, and the seedlings have sprouted, my millet has not yet been planted. Alas! It is true that participating in mutual aid brings benefits, and not participating in mutual aid causes harm." After his self-criticism, he immediately joined the mutual aid group. The next day, they planted millet for him, and the third day, they planted corn. He said that his thinking was clear. In the discussion, everyone clarified that there is strength in mutual aid, and there are ways to overcome any difficulties. Then, the whole village conducted exchanges of experience by street and group. From discussing methods and comparing achievements, they selected model mutual aid groups Zhao Shuyuan and Ji Tuhai, who were fair in recording work points and converting work, and did a good job in combining agriculture and sideline occupations. Model military family member Shao Yinchen and three others not only declined substitute farming but also provided substitute farming for military families without labor. Model retired soldiers Meng Wenjing and Wang Mengzhen also led everyone in production. In addition, they also selected model cadres, textile models, and grain transportation models, among others. After the evaluation, in addition to issuing awards, the village children congratulated the models, urging them to work harder to lead everyone in production and become prosperous, adding more achievements to their merits. Now, the entire village is continuing their efforts to prepare for weeding the seedlings and harvesting wheat, and striving to use the gaps to build water conservancy projects.

　　故漳总结下种运动
    群众认识互助好处
    【本报潞城讯】故漳总结下种评选模范，群众从自己的亲身经验中认识到互助的好处。四街老杜说“过去我只种五亩地，一年忙到头也种不好，去年翻身后，又给我分配了十来亩地、半个牲口，今年互助起来，我的地犁的深、耙的平，现在俊生生的小苗都长出来了。”：陈拉玉说：“我种地根本是外行，今年参加了互助，地种好了，还学了几样种地本领，我沾了互助光”。陈万青说：“我有八亩水地好几年就没有种上过，我一个人力量小，不等种上庄稼，水就满了，今年互助起来人多力量大，早早就种上了，毛主席号召互助生产办法实在好。”陶小孩的儿子是民兵，参战走了，他在王阳下煤窑，回来家看到种上地很惊讶，干部告他说，是互助组种上的，他高兴的说：“互助起来有办法，我儿参战再迟三个月不回来我也不着急。”没有参加互助的懒汉李建文很后悔说：“我以前认为互助是在一块喧，我又不很会做生活，怕参加互助不随便，现在大家都下了种，小苗都长出土了，我的谷还没有种上，唉！真是参加互助沾了光，不参加互助被了伤。”他检讨后立即参加了互助组。第二天给他种上了谷，第三天栽上了玉茭，他说他的思想通了。在讨论中大家明确了互助起来有力量，什么困难也有办法，接着全村按街按组进行交流经验，从谈办法比成绩中，选出模范互助组赵树元、几秃孩，他们是记工、折工公道，农副业结合好。模范军属邵银辰等四名不但谢绝代耕，还给没劳力军属代耕，模范荣退军人孟文景、王孟珍还领导大家生产，此外还评选了模范干部、纺织模范、运粮模范等多人，经评选后除发奖外，该村儿童给模范贺功，要他们更努力领导大家生产发财，功上加功。现全村群众正再接再厉，准备锄苗麦收，并争取空隙兴修水利。
