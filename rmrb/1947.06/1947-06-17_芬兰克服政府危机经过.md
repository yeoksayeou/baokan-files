　　Finland Overcomes Government Crisis
    Note: The government crisis created by the Finnish reactionaries began in mid-April, lasted for more than a month, and ended in late last month with the reinstatement of the Pekkala Cabinet. The reactionaries' attempt to abolish the progressive policy program of the current government failed, and the democratic forces in Finland were further consolidated than before. Just as the Finnish court was trying the secret arms depot case with a major conspiracy, the Finnish reactionaries, led by the Coalition Party and the right wing of the Social Democratic Party, intensified their attack on the Pekkala Cabinet. The Agrarian League, on the pretext of opposing the government's decision to increase the wages of urban transport workers, recalled its ministers from the cabinet, forcing Prime Minister Pekkala to resign on April 11. The reactionaries hoped that the new cabinet could be composed of representatives including some right-wing parties. The Coalition Party attempted to quickly join the government to restore the reactionary old order, and launched a civil war and an anti-Soviet war to enslave the working class. During this period, U.S. imperialism took the opportunity to increase the amount of loans promised to Finland for purchasing surplus materials from 15 million to 25 million U.S. dollars, in an attempt to help the reactionaries. However, people from all over the country held meetings to protest, demanding that the current government's policies be maintained, and workers also demanded that worker representatives be added to the government. The Finnish Communist Party also issued a statement supporting the Pekkala government. Facts show that if the reactionaries do not take into account the interests of the Finnish People's Democratic League, the government crisis cannot be overcome. Furthermore, dissolving the parliament and holding new elections would be even more unfavorable to the reactionaries. Therefore, after more than a month of struggle, their conspiracy finally failed. The three major parliamentary groups of the Finnish People's Democratic League, the Social Democratic Party, and the Agrarian League reached an agreement again. At the request of the Finnish President, Pekkala revoked his resignation on the 20th.

　　芬兰克服政府危机经过
    按：芬兰反动派所造成的政府危机，起于四月中旬，历时月余，已于上月下旬因派克拉内阁之复职而告结束，反动派企图取消现政府进步施政纲领的阴谋失败，芬兰民主力量较前更形巩固。正当芬兰法院审判有重大阴谋的秘密军器库案之际，以联合党及社会民主党右翼为首的芬兰反动派加强了对派克拉内阁的进攻，土地联盟借口反对政府提高城市运输工人工资的决定，从内阁中召回其各部长，迫使内阁总理派克拉于四月十一辞职。反动派期望新阁能以包括某些右翼政党的代表组成，联合党企图很快加入政府，以恢复反动的旧秩序，并发动奴役工人阶级的内战和反苏战争。在此期间，美帝国主义则乘机将允诺贷予芬兰购买剩余物资的贷款额由一千五百万元增至两千五百万元，以图帮助反动派。但全国各地人民纷纷开会抗议，要求维持现行政府的政策，工人并要求政府中增加工人代表。芬共亦发表声明拥护派克拉政府。事实说明，如果反动派不顾及芬兰人民民主联盟的利益，政府危机便不能克服。而解散国会重新选举，对反动派更为不利。因此，经过月余挣扎，其阴谋终告失败，芬兰人民民主联盟，社会民主党及土地联盟三大国会党团之间重新获得协议，派克拉应芬兰总统之请求，于二十日撤消辞职。
