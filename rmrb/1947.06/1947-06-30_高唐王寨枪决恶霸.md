　　【This Dispatch from Jinnan on the 28th】Wang Qing-shi and Wang Chang-xiao, feudal local tyrants and special agents from Wangzhai, Gaotang were executed. After the liberation of Gaotang, when Wangzhai mobilized the masses, they organized a fake peasant association to threaten the masses and undermine all government orders. After being reported by the masses, Comrade Chen Qingyuan from the district sent four armed men to arrest Wang Qing-shi and three others. He also exposed the rumors to the masses. At this time, Wang Chang-xiao led his "henchmen" to threaten the deceived masses, preventing the arrest of Wang Qing-shi and others. After Comrade Chen's repeated but ineffective persuasion, Wang and his accomplices closed the village gate, preparing for a riot, and shouted wildly, "We might as well die trying!" The district quickly arrested all of Wang Chang-xiao and his gang. After interrogation, Wang Qing-shi and Wang Chang-xiao were found to be extremely guilty and were executed on the 26th of last month. Accomplices Wang Qing-li, Wang Qing-de, and others were sentenced to imprisonment for one to three years. At this time, the masses said, "Now we truly have our own clear sky." The struggle to settle accounts with landlords and local tyrants then unfolded.

　　高唐王寨枪决恶霸
    【本报冀南二十八日电】高唐四区枪毙王寨封建恶霸特务王清仕、王长孝。高唐解放后，王寨发动群众时，他们组织假农会威胁群众，破坏一切政令，经群众告发，区里派陈庆元同志带武装四人，首将王清仕等四人逮捕，并向群众揭破谣言，此时王长孝带领其“狗腿”威胁被骗群众，不叫逮捕王清仕等，经陈同志再三说服无效，王逆等封闭寨门，准备暴动，并狂吠“怎么也是死干吧”！区里迅速将王长孝等全部逮捕，经审讯结果，王清仕、王长孝实属罪大恶极，乃于上月廿六日枪决。胁从分子王庆里、王庆德等判处一年至三年徒刑，此时群众说：“现在真是咱们的青天”，清算地主恶霸的斗争随即展开。
