　　The entire region is lacking rain, and the summer wheat harvest has generally decreased. Some areas are only harvesting 50-60% of the usual yield, while most are only getting 30-40%. Although there has been rainfall in various places recently, the amount is still far from sufficient, and a drought is already forming. Even if we get heavy rain in the future, the autumn harvest will certainly be poor. If the drought continues, it will inevitably become a disaster. Coupled with the huge consumption of manpower and resources and the enemy's frantic looting, this will cause us serious difficulties. We must fully recognize this, and everyone should be mentally prepared. How to lead the military and civilians of the entire region to overcome this drought and famine and get through the difficulties has become one of the urgent tasks of the Party, government, army, and people of the entire region, and we must not neglect or be complacent, otherwise we will make mistakes!

　　We are not afraid of difficulties, we can overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and we will certainly be able to conquer nature. As the saying goes, "Man will conquer nature," which means that by organizing human power, we can overcome nature. Our policy is: resolutely lead and organize the broad masses to fight the drought themselves. The years 1942 and 1943 were the most severe years of famine, with floods, droughts, locusts, and the Japanese all striking together, and natural and man-made disasters were unparalleled, but we overcame them victoriously. Today's conditions are better than they were then: we already have the rich experience of overcoming disasters in 1942 and 1943, we have a unified and complete liberated area, and the mountains, plains, and strategic areas are completely connected, which can be used for regulation. The drought is just beginning, as long as we inherit and carry forward the past experience in overcoming disasters and its spirit of perseverance, and adhere to this policy, we are confident that we can lead the people of the entire region to overcome the drought and famine!

　　The drought prevention and famine preparation production and thrift campaign has already begun, and it must be continued in depth and expanded, with a long-term perspective. To this end, first, we must pay attention to overcoming two kinds of thinking in the campaign: first, the mentality of waiting, waiting for rain, and "relying on heaven for food," thinking that if it rains in another month or so, the late crops will still catch up. The harm of this kind of thinking lies in taking a laissez-faire attitude towards the struggle, relaxing actual preparations, and missing the farming season. Second, the thinking of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture. The view is: "Rather earn cash on hand than earn what you can't see," not starting from the long term, not understanding that grain production is our main production, and only by developing sideline occupations on the basis of agriculture can we implement the combination of agriculture and sideline occupations. Both of these ideas must be overcome. Second, the entire region must be urgently mobilized, organizing women and all part-time laborers, organizing all livestock, and organizing all rear-area organs and troops in the entire region to enter the production and famine preparation campaign. We call on the entire region: "Sweat more, eat less," "No one or animal idle, no acre of land left uncultivated." We ask the millions of district and village cadres and leaders at all levels in the entire region to take the lead personally and fight together with the 30 million people of the entire region. Resolutely fight against natural disasters, and do our best to rush planting and rush cultivation, plant one seedling that lives, plant one acre that lives. As long as the cadres take the lead and come up with ideas and methods for the masses, the masses will quickly take action. We call on the labor heroes and heroines who have turned over in the entire region, asking you to play a heroic role and a locomotive role in the production and famine preparation campaign, and to be the backbone of the masses. We call on all organs and troops in the entire region to help the masses rush to plant and rush to cultivate with the greatest strength, helping wherever they go, and helping wherever they are stationed, and promoting and influencing the masses with their own model actions of production and thrift. Now the entire region must be organized in a unified action, and various mutual aid groups and labor exchange teams must be quickly formed on a voluntary basis, using various mass organizations to give full play to their strength in order to overcome the contradictions caused by the lack of labor due to participation in the war and army and the decentralization of individual labor. Organizing can overcome natural disasters, which is the most valuable experience we have gained in overcoming disaster struggles in the past few years.

　　We must inherit and carry forward the many drought prevention and famine preparation methods that the masses have created in the past, and continue to humbly learn from the masses, give play to the creativity of the masses, and exchange experiences from various places. Now we put forward the following suggestions for drought prevention and famine preparation in the entire region:

　　I. Vigorously organize the masses to produce. The current main task is to seize the time to organize the masses to rush to plant. Those who have not planted should immediately organize full and part-time laborers to carry water and plant by the point method. For example, Dachen Village in Qi'e County, Jinnan, organized mutual aid groups, with young and middle-aged people carrying water, old people digging pits, and women and children planting seeds. Within five days, they planted 250 acres of cotton and 30 acres of winter melon, and are continuing to plant sorghum. According to incomplete statistics, 300,000 acres of cotton have been planted in Taihang, and many seedlings have grown. Shiming County in Taiyue has also planted 20,000 acres of cotton. In addition, dry planting (the so-called planting in dry land) can also be implemented. At the same time, the masses should be actively organized to dig wells, repair wells, and open canals to divert water for irrigation, while digging wells and sowing seeds. Universally promote the experience of Chengci Matou District in repairing canals and irrigating 40,000 acres of land. In areas with a shortage of seedlings, replanting should be organized in a timely manner. Those who have already sprouted seedlings should rush to weed, and promote the experience of "weeding the ground once is equal to three points of water." In addition, vacant land should be used to plant melons and vegetables to supplement the shortage of food. After completing sowing and weeding, the masses should be organized to carry out sideline production during the gaps, organize textile and transportation, organize women and children to collect wild vegetables, store and purchase bran, and widely make substitute foods. In short, all production methods should be used to solve the difficulties in the production of the masses as much as possible, so as to improve the production interest of the masses and increase the income of the people, so as to make full preparations for drought prevention.

　　II. Launch a struggle to protect the summer harvest and protect grain. We must take active and proactive actions to combat the enemy's grain grabbing, organize the masses to harvest and store quickly, and implement the combination of labor and military affairs. It is strictly forbidden to export and smuggle grain, and violators will be punished according to law. In addition, attention should be paid to the storage of grain to prevent consumption and losses.

　　III. Practice thrift and avoid extravagance and waste. We call on the military and civilians of the entire region to universally reduce the level of production, economize on food and clothing, and overcome difficulties, starting with the cadres. All rear-area organs and troops are required to save two to four taels of millet per person per day, cancel the small stoves for cadres, and catch up with the lives of the peasants. The masses should also calculate their food consumption accurately, and especially cherish the fruits of the struggle that have been won, oppose the idea of ​​eating and drinking, and clearly establish a long-term perspective. Efforts should be made to conserve and cherish civilian power. Except for special military circumstances, all errands should be stopped, meetings should be held as little as possible, or even not held, local operas should be stopped, Yangko dances should not be twisted, and comfort donations should be stopped if they are not urgent. In short, anything that increases the burden on the people and does not help the war should not be done. Village finances should be thoroughly reorganized to ensure that the annual village burden for each person in each village does not exceed five catties of millet, and to achieve complete self-sufficiency as far as possible from the reorganization of public property and the development of production, so as to reduce the burden on the people and create a habit of thrift and frugality in the entire region.

### 开展防旱备荒生产节约运动

　　开展防旱备荒生产节约运动
    全区缺雨，夏麦普遍减收，多者只收五六成，一般均是三四成。最近各地虽先后降雨，雨量仍极不足，旱象已成，即使今后可获透雨，秋收也一定歉收，如继续亢旱势必成灾。加之巨大人力物力消耗和敌人疯狂的抢劫掠夺，将会给我们造成严重困难，对此必须充分认识，每个人均应作思想准备。当前如何领导全区军民征服此旱荒，渡过困难，成为全区党政军民紧急任务之一，不容忽视麻痹，否则就会造成错误！
    我们不畏惧困难，能够战胜困难，战胜敌人，亦必能战胜自然。语云：“人定胜天”，意思就是把人力组织起来可以战胜自然。我们的方针是：坚决领导与组织广大群众自己起来与旱灾作斗争。一九四二年四三年是灾荒最严重的年代，水、旱、蝗、日一齐袭来，天灾兵祸无以复加，但我们胜利渡过了。今天的条件比当时好：我们已有四二、四三两年克服灾荒的丰富经验，有统一完整的解放区，山地平原及各战略区之间已完全连成一片，可作调剂。旱象初成，只要我们继承和发扬过去克服灾荒的经验及其坚毅精神，坚持这条方针，我们有信心领导全区人民战胜旱荒！
    防旱备荒生产节约运动已经开始，必须继续深入和扩大，从长期着眼。为此，第一必须在运动中注意克服两种思想：首先是等待思想，坐等下雨，“靠天吃饭”，认为再等个把月下雨，晚庄稼还赶得上。这种思想之所以有害在于对斗争采取放任自流的态度，松懈实际准备，以至错过农时。其次是重副轻农的思想，其观点是：“宁赚现过现，不赚眼不见”，不是从长期出发，不了解粮食生产是我们主要的生产，只有在农业为主基础上发展副业，实行农副结合。这两种思想均必须克服。第二必须全区紧急动员起来，组织妇女全半劳动力，组织全部牲畜，组织全区后方机关部队进入生产备荒运动，我们向全区号召：“多流汗，少饿饭”，“不闲一人一畜，不荒一亩土地”，要求全区百万区村干部各级领导人亲自带头，与全区三千万人民共同奋斗。坚决向天灾作斗争，全力抢种抢耕，种活一苗是一苗，种活一亩是一亩，只要干部带头，为群众出主意想办法，群众就会迅速行动起来。我们向全区翻身英雄劳动英雄号召，要求你们在生产备荒运动中起英雄作用，火车头作用，作群众的骨干。我们向全区机关部队号召要求你们以最大力量帮助群众抢种抢耕，走到那里帮助到那里，驻在那里帮助在那里，并以本身生产节约的模范行动推动与影响群众。现在全区必须组织在统一的行动中，必须迅速在自愿基础上组成各种互助组，变工队，运用各种群众组织，充分发挥其力量，以克服因参战参军劳力不足和个体劳动、劳力分散所产生的矛盾。组织起来就能战胜天灾，这是几年来我们克服灾荒斗争最宝贵的经验。
    过去群众自己所创造过许多防旱备荒的办法，我们必须继承和发扬这种创造，并继续虚心向群众学习，发挥群众的创造性，交流各地经验。现在我们对全区防旱备荒提出下列意见：
    一、全力组织群众生产。当前主要任务是抓紧时间组织群众突击下种，凡未下种者应即组织全半劳力担水点种，如冀南企之县打町村组织互助组，青壮年担水，老年掘坑，妇女儿童下种，五天内点种二百五十亩棉花，三十亩北瓜，正继续点种高粱。据不完全统计，太行已点种棉花三十万亩，青苗多已长成，太岳士敏县亦点种棉花两万亩。此外还可实行旱种（即所谓干地寄种）。同时应积极组织群众打井、修井，开渠引水浇地，一面打井一面播种。普遍发扬成磁马头区修渠灌田四万亩的经验。对缺苗地区应适时组织补种。凡已出苗者应突击锄苗，发扬“地锄一遍三分水”的经验。此外还应利用空地点瓜种菜，以补粮食不足。在完成播种锄苗以后，应利用空隙组织群众进行副业生产，组织纺织和运输，组织妇女儿童采集野菜，储购糠面，广泛制作代食品。总之应利用一切生产的办法，尽量解决群众生产中的困难。以提高群众生产兴趣，增加人民收入，以作防旱的充分准备。
    二、开展保卫夏收保卫粮食斗争。必须以积极主动的行动打击敌人的抢粮，组织群众快收快藏，实行劳武结合。并严禁粮食出口走私，违者法办。此外应注意粮食的保管工作，防止消耗、损失。
    三、厉行节约力戒铺张浪费。我们号召全区军民普遍降低生产水平，节衣缩食，渡过困难，首先从干部作起，要求所有后方机关部队每日每人节约小米二两至四两，干部小灶取消，向农民生活看齐。群众食用亦应精确计算，特别应爱惜既得斗争果实，反对大吃大喝的思想，明确树立长期观念。对于民力应亟力节约爱护，除军事特殊情况外，一律停止支差，大会应尽量少开，甚至不开，社戏停唱，秧歌不扭，慰劳捐款非当务之急，亦一律停止。总之凡足以增加人民负担而对战争无补的事一概不做。村财政应予彻底整理，保证每村每人全年村负担不得超过五斤小米，并尽可能从整理公产，开展生产，作到完全自给，以减轻人民负担，造成全区省吃俭用的风尚。
