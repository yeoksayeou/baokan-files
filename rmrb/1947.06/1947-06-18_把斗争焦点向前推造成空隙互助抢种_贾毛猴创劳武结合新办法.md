　　Pushing the Focus of Struggle Forward Creates Gaps for Mutual Aid in Rushing Planting;
    Jia Mao Hou Creates a New Method Combining Labor and Military Affairs
    [This newspaper reports] Jia Mao Hou, a famous hero in Taihang who killed enemies, led the militia of Fancun Village to create a new method combining labor and military affairs: "One hand holding a gun, the other hand holding seeds; fight when there are enemies, plant when there are no enemies." The militia also participates in production, without the need for the masses to farm on their behalf. Since the spring plowing, the masses have saved 425 workdays. The specific methods are as follows: All 62 militiamen in the village are organized into six large groups and eighteen small groups, based on neighborhood units, and combined with the mutual aid of the masses in production. According to the village environment, the area in front of the village is designated as the front line, and the area behind the village is designated as the rear line. In general, young and middle-aged people cooperate with the militia on the front line, and other masses work on the rear line. If a sudden situation occurs and the situation is urgent, they will cover the transfer of the masses. When it's not serious, only a militia group is sent to monitor the enemy, and other militiamen lead the masses in production. They do whatever work is urgent in the fields, regardless of whose land it is. If it is the land of the masses, they will settle the account with the masses' mutual aid group when they return. If it is the land of the militia, it will be settled by the militia's mutual aid group. A work-point system is implemented, with points assigned by the day and work calculated based on points. Accounts are settled every half month, with no wages owed, in order to consolidate mutual aid. In addition, the armed forces are used flexibly to carry out guerrilla production, establish close contact and cooperation with the militias of surrounding villages, take the initiative to go deep behind enemy lines to carry out activities, push the focus of struggle forward, and create gaps for production. Militia armed groups and production groups can be dispersed or concentrated at any time, and inter-village joint defense and mutual aid production are implemented. For example, when the militia and masses of the former village are transferred to the rear village, they participate in the rear village's mutual aid production. Usually, the rear village supports the front village and helps the front village in production.
    [This newspaper reports] The Wu Committee of the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang issued a call to the Wu Committees of various counties to organize militias to combat the enemy's and puppets' renewed conspiracy to seize grain, pointing out that in this stage of the wheat harvest struggle, we have achieved great victories, but this is only the beginning of a tense struggle. In the future, we must: 1. Deeply educate the masses to eliminate complacency and mobilize the masses to quickly hide grain, and provide the masses with more methods, avoiding luck and complacency. 2. Continue to vigorously organize mass blasting movements, educate the masses on blasting techniques, solve the material difficulties and ideological concerns of the masses in blasting, and mobilize the masses to use thunder to guard the threshing grounds and caves. Cadres should also personally take action and take the lead in leading teams to attack the enemy with explosives. 3. Solve the labor difficulties of the families of front-line militiamen, organize labor-military work exchanges to help with fighting, hiding, and planting, and mobilize the village and families to write letters of condolences to stabilize emotions and boost morale by informing them of the situation of the village helping the families.

    贾毛猴创劳武结合新办法
    【本报讯】太行著名杀敌英雄贾毛猴领导范村民兵创造劳武结合新办法：“一手拿枪，一手拿种，有敌就打，没敌就种”。民兵也参加生产，不用群众代耕，春耕以来，群众省工四百廿五个，其具体做法如下：全村民兵共六十二人，组成六个大组，十八个小组，以闾为单位，和群众生产互助相结合并按本村环境，将村前划为前线，村后划为后线，一般情况，青壮年配合民兵到前线，其他群众在后线，如突然发生情况，来势紧急就掩护群众转移，不大要紧时，只派一个民兵小组监视敌人，其他民兵领导群众生产，看地里那样活紧，不管谁家的就做，若是群众的地，回去给群众互助组算账，若是民兵的地由民兵互助组算账。实行工票制，按天订分，按分折工，半月算账一次，不欠工资，以巩固互助。另外灵活使用武装，展开游击生产，与周围村庄的民兵取得密切联系配合，主动深入敌后活动，将斗争焦点推向前边，打出生产空隙，民兵武装小组与生产小组，随时可以分散，随时可以集中，并实行联防村互助生产，如前村民兵，群众转移至后村时，参加后村互助生产，平时后村支援前村，帮助前村生产。
    【本报讯】太行四分区武委会的顷号召各县武委会，组织民兵，打击敌伪再次抢粮阴谋，指出在此一段小麦收斗争中，我们取得了很大的胜利，但这只是紧张斗争的一个开端。今后仍须：一、深入教育群众，消除轻敌心理，动员群众迅速打藏，多给群众想办法，切忌侥幸苟安。二、继续大力组织群众性的爆炸运动，教育群众爆炸技术解决群众爆炸中的物质困难与思想顾虑，发动群众用雷看场，用雷看洞，干部还亲自动手，主动率队打敌爆炸。三、解决前方民兵家庭劳力困难，组织劳武变工帮打帮藏帮种，并发动村中与家庭给其写信慰问，告知村中帮助家庭情形安定情绪提高斗志。
