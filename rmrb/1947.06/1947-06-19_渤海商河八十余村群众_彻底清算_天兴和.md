Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th. The masses in more than eighty villages in the Chengguan District of Shanghe, Bohai, re-investigated and conducted a second liquidation of five landlord families, including Cheng Dengke, former quartermaster of the Northern Warlord Sun Chuanfang, in Liuhang Village. Seventy-five mu of hidden land, two silver ingots, more than sixty pieces of gold and silver utensils, and more than a thousand pieces of valuable clothing were found, along with other items and livestock. The feudal rule was completely crushed. Cheng Dengke and others opened the "Tianxinghe" silver house in Shanghe, and usury loans spread throughout the district, exploiting more than four qing of farmers' land. In just a few years, "Tianxinghe's" tall buildings occupied half of the village's land, and the houses of thirteen peasant families were swallowed up, leaving the masses unable to breathe. When land reform began last winter, the masses once liquidated the landlords, but the masses failed to mobilize due to the conspiracy of the landlord Cheng Baozhen to sabotage it. At the beginning of this re-investigation, in eighty villages in the district, sixty victims, four hundred peasant representatives, and more than three thousand people thoroughly liquidated "Tianxinghe." After the liquidation, the fruits were immediately distributed and the organization was reorganized, and the masses were liberated.

　　渤海商河八十余村群众
    彻底清算“天兴和”
    【新华社山东十四日电】渤海商河城关区八十余村群众，复查中二次清算柳行村前北洋军阀孙传芳军需处长程登科等五家地主，查出黑地七十五亩，元宝两只，金银器具六十余件，珍贵衣服千余件，并有其他物品及牲口等，封建统治彻底摧垮。程登科等曾在商河开设“天兴和”银号，高利贷放遍全区，盘剥农民土地四顷多。不几年间，“天兴和”高楼大厦占了全村的一半地皮，十三家农民的房屋都被吞并，群众被压得不敢喘气。去冬土地改革开始，群众一度向地主清算，因遭地主程保珍阴谋破坏，群众未发动起来。此次复查开始，该区八十个村，六十个苦主，四百个农民代表，三千余群众对“天兴和”进行了彻底的清算，清算后立即分配果实，整理组织，群众获得翻身。
