　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: TASS, Belgrade: When Marshal Tito received Bulgarian journalists, he commented on the Balkan situation and the tasks facing the Balkan countries. Part of his speech was as follows: "Domestic national and political unity is of particular importance to our small country. Equally important is the unity of our Balkan Slavic peoples. Our Bulgarian and Yugoslav peoples are striving for amity, and no one has the right to hinder our amity. The same goes for Albania. They are not Slavs, but they have been our neighbors for centuries. In the past, they were used to incite conflicts between Balkan countries, but that belongs to the past. The existing domestic social system there provides a guarantee for close ties between us and the Albanian people. We must consolidate the unity among the Balkan peoples." Marshal Tito answered reporters' questions, explaining how to establish relations between the republics, including Yugoslavia, and their economic cooperation. Regarding the issue of Slovenian Carinthia, Marshal Tito replied: "The prospect of us obtaining all our demands is currently limited. I believe that to some extent, we can be satisfied; however, these resolutions will not remain permanently unchanged. We must abide by these resolutions because we are members of the United Nations. However, this does not mean that we completely abandon our demands." In commenting on the situation in Greece, Marshal Tito expressed his indignation at border provocations and described the domestic situation in Greece as "unprecedented terror carried out under the protection of well-known imperialist forces." Bulgarian journalists asked about Yugoslavia's Five-Year Plan, and Marshal Tito expressed confidence that once the Five-Year Plan is realized, Yugoslavia will be completely independent of Western countries.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Comprehensive report: Yugoslavia is actively developing economic cooperation and trade relations with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European New Democratic countries. The treaty on economic cooperation and commodity exchange between Poland and Yugoslavia, and its subsidiary agreements and drafts, were signed in Warsaw in late May by delegations from both countries. It stipulates that the two countries will exchange goods equivalent to a total value of 215 million US dollars over five years. The Yugoslav newspaper "Combat" published a commentary saying: "Because of these treaties and agreements, the people of Yugoslavia and Poland are filled with more confidence in their future. We have long recognized the consistency of our interests, and we must use all our strength to completely eradicate the forces of those who attempt to violate our freedom or seize our resources." The trade agreement between Finland and Yugoslavia was also signed in Helsinki earlier this month. Meanwhile, the Yugoslav trade delegation, led by Nikola Petrovic, Minister of Foreign Trade, arrived in the Soviet Union last month and is still staying in the Soviet Union, where they have been warmly welcomed.

　　铁托元帅对保加利亚记者谈
    巴尔干各国力求亲睦
    南国积极发展对东欧各国经济合作
    【新华社陕北十二日电】塔斯社伯尔格莱德讯：铁托元帅在接见保加利亚各新闻记者时，评论巴尔干情势及巴尔干各国面临之工作，其谈话之一部分如下：“国内民族的和政治的团结，对于我们小国来说，是特别关系重大的。同样重要的是我们巴尔干斯拉夫各国人民的团结。我们保、南两国人民正力求亲睦，任何人都没有权利阻挠我们亲睦。对阿尔巴尼亚也一样，他们不是斯拉夫人，但已是我们几世纪的邻人。过去他们被人利用以达煽起巴尔干国家冲突的目的，现在，这是属于过去的了，那里现存的国内社会制度提供了吾人和阿国人民密切联系的保证。我们必须巩固巴尔干人民间的团结。”铁托元帅答记者问，说明如何建立包括南斯拉夫在内的各共和国家间的关系，以及它们的经济合作。关于斯洛文尼亚卡伦地亚的问题，铁托元帅答称：“我们获得全部要求的前途目下尚受限制。我相信在某种程度内，我们可以获得满足；但是这些决议不会永久保持不变，我们一定服从这些决议，因为我们是联合国的会员，然而，这并不意味着我们全部放弃我们的要求。”在评论希腊情势中，铁托元帅表示对于国界挑衅事件的愤慨，并且叙述希腊国内情势为“在尽人皆知的帝国主义势力保护下进行的空前恐怖”。保加利亚记者们问到南国五年计划的问题，铁托元帅表示确信：五年计划实现了，南斯拉夫将完全不仰给于西方的国家。
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：南斯拉夫积极发展对苏及东欧各新民主主义国家间的经济合作与贸易关系。波（兰）南经济合作与商品交换条约及其附属之协定与草约，已于五月下旬在华沙由两国代表团签订。规定两国在五年间交换总值与二亿一千五百万美元相当的商品。南国“战斗”报发表评论说：“因为这些条约和协定，南波两国人民对于他们的将来更充满了信心。我们早已认识到我们利益的一致性，我们必须用一切力量，把企图侵犯我们自由或攫取我们富源的人们的势力彻底铲除。”芬（兰）南贸易协定亦于本月初在赫尔辛基签订。同时，由对外贸易部部长尼古拉·彼特罗维国率领的南国贸易代表团，自上月抵苏后，现仍留苏联，备受欢迎。
