Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th -- In the People's Liberation Army's May self-defense war, a total of eleven and a half Nationalist Army regular brigades were annihilated. Adding this to the seventy-nine and a half Nationalist Army brigades annihilated in the previous ten months, the total for the past eleven months amounts to ninety-one Nationalist Army brigades annihilated. The Nationalist Army regular forces annihilated in the May operations include one division headquarters, six entire brigades, one brigade headquarters, eleven entire regiments, and nineteen entire battalions. The numbers of Nationalist Army regular forces below the battalion level and non-regular forces annihilated in various areas are not included in this count. These eleven and a half brigades are accounted for as follows: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated three entire brigades (divisions), three entire regiments, and seven entire battalions. The East China People's Liberation Army annihilated one division headquarters (namely the reorganized 74th Division), three entire brigades, two entire regiments, and four entire battalions. The Northwest People's Liberation Army annihilated one brigade headquarters (namely the 167th Brigade of the First Division), two entire regiments, and four entire battalions. The Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army annihilated three entire regiments. The Southern Jin People's Liberation Army annihilated one entire regiment and two entire battalions. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu People's Liberation Army annihilated two entire battalions. The largest battles in May were the battle to annihilate the Nationalist Army's reorganized 74th Division in Menglianggu, Shandong, from the 13th to the 16th; the battle to annihilate the 88th and 91st divisions (equivalent to reorganized brigades) of the Nationalist Army's 71st Army in Huaide, Northeast, on the 18th; the recovery of Meihekou on the 28th and the annihilation of the 184th Division (same as above) of the Nationalist Army's 60th Army; and the recovery of Panlong in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia and the annihilation of the 167th Brigade of the Nationalist Army's First Division.
