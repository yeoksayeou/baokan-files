　　Using Landmines to Block Enemy and Puppet Strongholds
    Wuzhi Launches Anti-Grain Robbery Struggle

    [Reported from Wuzhi by this newspaper] Following the successful wheat harvest protection in Wuzhi, continued efforts are now being made to launch a new anti-grain robbery struggle. On the 10th of this month, hundreds of enemies from Mulandian, accompanied by a large number of civilian laborers and vehicles, attempted to rob grain from villages in the Qinhe River area. When their advance troops, numbering over fifty, reached the area west of Wuche, they fell right into the ambush set by our anti-grain robbery troops and militia. After a burst of assault from us, the enemy fled in panic, abandoning two corpses and even leaving their wounded behind, retreating in disarray. In this engagement, we killed and wounded over twenty enemies, seized four rifles, a portion of ammunition, and a large pile of carts and small vehicles used for grain robbery. The masses were overjoyed to hear this and actively carried out condolences, celebrating the victory of the first shot in the anti-grain robbery struggle.

    Furthermore, prior to the wheat harvest, Wuzhi specially trained a group of explosive experts, researched plain landmine laying techniques, and launched an explosive merit campaign, organizing × explosive teams. After the struggle to protect the wheat harvest, the power of explosives has been demonstrated for the first time. Now, in order to thoroughly strike at the enemy and puppet's grain robbery, a plan to block enemy and puppet strongholds with landmines has been specially researched. Everyone's enthusiasm is high, and each district has re-established new plans to serve the people and kill the enemy with landmines.
