　　Shandong Battlefield Defeated General
    Wang Yaowu's Lament
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd] Shanghai Newspaper reports: Jiang's Second Pacification Zone Commander and Shandong Province Chairman Wang Yaowu, a defeated general in the Shandong battlefield, during a certain gathering when reviewing the military situation in Shandong Province, once again lamented, claiming that the "fatal shortcomings" of the Jiang army are three: "(1) Although having a lot of 'suppressing bandits' experience, they do not know how to use it flexibly. (2) Many troops commit the problem of 'fearing the enemy but not the law'. (3) Many senior cadres are perfunctory when encountering problems and cannot come up with solutions."

    王耀武哀鸣
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】沪报讯：山东战场败将蒋记第二绥靖区主任兼山东省主席王耀武，于某次集会中检讨鲁境军事形势时又发出哀鸣称：蒋军的“致命缺点”有三个：“（一）‘剿匪’经验虽多，但不懂得灵活运用。（二）许多部队犯‘畏敌不畏法’毛病。（三）许多上级干部遇事敷衍，拿不出办法。”
