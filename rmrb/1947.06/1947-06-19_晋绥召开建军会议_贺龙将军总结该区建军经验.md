Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 10th. The Jin-Sui Military Region convened an army building conference to further implement Chairman Mao's army building line ideologically and organizationally, improve the thinking of military cadres, improve work style, strengthen internal unity, and build a people's army closely connected with the masses, wholeheartedly serving the people, and implementing land reform. The conference lasted two months and three days, and recently concluded successfully. Attendees included military and political cadres at the regiment level and above from the military region, local corps, and field columns. Under the personal leadership of the leaders of the military region, they fully promoted a democratic style and a spirit of self-criticism, and conducted extensive discussions on issues such as the army building ideology of the troops, conscription, review of battles, political education, Party work, financial supply, and medical and health. In speeches in groups and at the general meeting, from bottom to top, the focus was on self-criticism, reviewing the present in connection with the past. In his speech, Commander He repeatedly guided and enlightened, making the issues more profound and clear. The focus of the conference was on reviewing the army building ideology, sharply criticizing the purely military viewpoint that ran counter to Chairman Mao's army building line, thereby enhancing the army building ideology of the people's army. Finally, Commander He Long made a concluding report. Commander He first pointed out: The biggest gain of this conference lies in the issue of building a people's army and serving the people. He called on everyone to bring the spirit of the conference back to the troops and unswervingly promote its realization. Commander He's report was divided into three parts: The first part reviewed the construction of our army based on Chairman Mao's army building ideology, pointing out that since our army entered Northwest Shanxi in 1937, its contributions and achievements to the people have been threefold: first, persisting in the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and defeating Japan; second, building the Jin-Sui Liberated Area; and third, expanding the troops. In recounting the historical facts of our army's eight-year War of Resistance, Commander He emphasized that in the past, our army building often started from the perspective of the army itself, and not enough attention was paid to political and Party building. Although some mass work was done in 1937, the main purpose was to expand the army, raise funds, and obtain weapons, without mobilizing the masses to reduce rent and interest, but rather grabbing a handful to solve the army's own problems. In 1941 and 1942, we were busy eating and dressing, and the subsequent self-reliance, ideologically did not clearly realize that it was for the three million people in the border area, but only for tens of thousands of public servants. This was manifested in agriculture and commerce with very bad styles, giving the masses serious bad results, causing the phenomenon of separation from the masses. Regarding the future construction of the troops, Commander He and Political Commissar Li, in their reports, repeatedly instructed the army to do mass work and participate in land reform. They pointed out that soldiers from hired peasant backgrounds all supported land reform; only a few from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds still needed education in their understanding, which is the central task at present. Because the land issue is not resolved, peasants cannot break through poverty. Soldiers pouring into the army from the peasant class cannot be consolidated, and therefore cannot achieve victory in the war. Conversely, if the army participates in land reform and becomes the backbone of the movement, extensively mobilizing the masses, and peasants have land, the regime can be built well, Party building will have a foundation, soldiers can solve the major issue of "fighting for whom," and army building will have good soldiers. But to achieve this goal, not only must there be a revolution organizationally, but also ideologically, and only by completely eliminating warlordism and roving banditry can this task be undertaken. For this reason, mass work groups must be organized in the troops, led by cadres at the brigade, regiment, column, sub-district, and military region levels, participating in land reform work under the unified leadership of the Party committee; cadres at all levels must participate in rotation. Deputy Party secretaries should be established in companies to specifically lead the company in doing mass work, to deepen the class views of the troops. Secondly, regarding the relationship between the army and the masses, Commander He pointed out: The army should vigorously help the masses restore production, invest in the masses, help develop sideline occupations, and ensure that they can completely turn over within one or two years. In order to reduce the burden on the masses, the troops will be streamlined, companies will be filled, and the spirit of the production supply conference will be implemented. All units will hand over all stores to the public to overcome the difficulties of manpower and material resources in the border area. In the second part of his concluding report, Commander He reviewed the issue of the troops' own construction, pointing out: Until now, our troops' management and education methods still have serious warlord tendencies, hindering the development of democracy. Commander He repeatedly criticized those who confined warlordism to beating and scolding, and he solemnly pointed out: "In the army, all thoughts and actions that violate the interests of the people are manifestations of warlordism." Secondly, under undemocratic economic conditions, the lives of soldiers have not been improved as they should be, while corruption has occurred among cadres. In the future, we must establish this idea that we should first serve the three million people. Within the troops, we must first serve the vast number of soldiers, love them very much, not only taking care of their own lives, but also taking care of their family lives. In taking care of the families of soldiers, we must first take care of the poor and hired peasant components, and earnestly solve their living problems. For cadres, we must first take care of company and platoon cadres, staff officers, secretaries, and clerks in the organs, and then higher-level cadres. Commander He severely criticized the unsound political life of the troops and the new formalism. In the company, a one-size-fits-all meeting replaces Party activities, making organizational life very unsound, greatly reducing the Party's leading role, which is very dangerous. After summarizing the above situation, Commander He instructed: In the future, the troops must start by developing political and economic democracy. In terms of political democracy, in addition to combat orders, all production, training, and learning movements can be initiated by soldiers for democratic discussion. Soldiers can criticize any cadre; for cadres who repeatedly fail to correct their mistakes, soldiers can report to the branch and transfer them to the higher Party committee for removal. Branch work must be greatly strengthened, and all cadres and Party members must participate in group life and report on their work and thoughts to the group. In particular, cadre Party members who are responsible for leadership must promote democracy and self-criticism in the group in order to listen to the opinions of the masses. Without this, it will be impossible to develop intra-Party democracy. In developing economic democracy, we must first achieve economic transparency, and establish economic committees at the level of meal units that are not merely formal, but truly represent the interests of soldiers and have real power. This economic committee, under the leadership of the branch, has the right to convene a general meeting of all soldiers in the company to discuss the economic issues of the unit. It can convene members at any time to settle accounts. The economic committees of each company can jointly inspect the economic expenditures of the battalion. The economic committee of the battalion can inspect the regiment. In this way, by analogy, check all the way to the military region. The economic committee must ensure that 80% of the economy is used to solve the problems of soldiers. Only by developing mass democratic movements in these two aspects can the problems of the company be easily solved. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must lead well, and if there is any suppression, Party members have the right to appeal. At the beginning of the democratic movement, some deviations are inevitable, and cadres must use good methods to grasp it and not be afraid of the mass movement. Only in this way can the development of political and economic democratic movements be guaranteed. In addition, rewards and punishments must be clear in the troops, and the promulgated regulations on punishing corruption and military law must be resolutely implemented. Comrades who have made meritorious service should also be rewarded; therefore, a great campaign of meritorious service should be launched in the troops. Recording merit must be discussed by all the soldiers in the company before it can gain the trust of the masses and promote the troops forward. These heroes and models only require one skill. Everything is good, the so-called "comprehensive" requirements will inevitably lead to failure; this has been proven by the experience of past hero model campaigns. Regarding military issues, Commander He explained in detail: We must admit the fact that the enemy is strong and we are weak, and the enemy is large and we are small, otherwise we will make mistakes. History proves that admitting this point, and concentrating our superior forces in campaigns and battles, attacking the enemy at one point, in order to turn our disadvantages into the enemy's disadvantages, we can defeat the enemy; as the recent victory in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia is clear evidence. Conversely, if we do not admit this fact and adopt dispersed forces, we cannot create our advantage and the enemy's disadvantage, and will inevitably lead to failure. At this point in the report, Commander He repeatedly emphasized the power of the masses, and reviewed the successes and failures of several battles based on this. He quoted Chairman Mao's words, "Our strength is millet plus rifles. If we look down on millet (that is, the power of the masses), we will inevitably move towards a purely military viewpoint. This rifle will certainly not have any effect." In the Panlong battle, our army exchanged a major victory with very few casualties, which is because we have the masses and the enemy does not. Commander He emphatically said here: In the future, we must strengthen militia work and enrich the masses' armed forces. Regarding improving the work of the military region organs themselves, Commander He pointed out: We must first overcome bureaucracy and formalism, commanders should go deep into the company to serve the soldiers, and the work of political departments at all levels must reach the company. In the third part of the concluding report, Commander He called on everyone to unite themselves and defeat the enemy. He powerfully said, "Only when we are united ideologically like a harmonious family can we quickly defeat the enemy." But this kind of unity is not and cannot be centered on any individual, it must be centered on the Party committee, and all issues must be discussed by the Party committee. In order to strengthen the Party's leadership, we will decide to restore the Party committee system of the Jinggangshan period. All departments should seriously improve the Party's work in accordance with the new draft of the Party committee system, promote intra-Party democracy, and make it the core of the army's leadership and unity. Secondly, in the past, we often had disagreements between upper and lower levels due to difficulties in manpower and material resources, or passively complained about the government, which is not right. Only by actively helping the masses solve the land problem, and improving the lives of the masses, can these difficulties be easily solved. Commander He's concluding report gave the comrades attending the meeting a new increase in ideological understanding. The work instructions that run through the class line in the report are orders issued to the entire army. Everyone unanimously expressed that they would unswervingly implement the spirit of the conference and the instructions of Commander He and Political Commissar Li into their actual work. At this point, the conference announced its successful conclusion. In addition to a part participating in land reform work, the comrades attending the meeting returned to the troops one after another with high confidence to welcome new battles and new victories.

　　晋绥召开建军会议
    贺龙将军总结该区建军经验
    【新华社晋绥十日电】晋绥军区为了进一步从思想上组织上贯彻毛主席的建军路线，提高部队干部思想，改进工作作风，加强内部团结，建设一支与群众密切联系的，全心全意为人民服务的，贯彻土地改革的人民军队，特召开建军会议。大会历两个月零三天，已于近日胜利结束。出席者包括军区、地方兵团、野战纵队团级以上军政干部。在军区首长亲自领导下，充分发扬民主作风与自我批评的精神，就部队建军思想、兵役问题、战役检讨、政治教育、党的工作、财政供给、医药卫生等问题作了广泛的讨论。在小组和大会的发言中，自下到上都以自我批评为主，检讨现在联系过去。大会发言中，贺司令员更循循诱导启发，使问题更加深刻明显。会议的中心，在检讨建军思想中，尖锐的批评了与毛主席建军路线背道而驰的单纯军事观点，从而提高了人民军队的建军思想。最后由贺龙司令员作总结报告，贺司令员首先指出：这次大会的最大收获在于建设人民军队、为人民服务的问题上。他号召大家把大会精神带回部队中去，毫不动摇的促其实现。贺司令员的报告共分三大部分：第一部分根据毛主席建军思想检讨我们的军队建设，指出自我军三七年进入晋西北的十年来，对于人民的贡献和功绩有三个：一，坚持八年抗战打败日本；二，建设了晋绥解放区；三，扩大了部队。贺司令员在历述我军八年抗战史实中，着重指出过去我们建军常常从军队本位出发对建政、建党都重视不够。三七年虽然作了一些群众工作，但主要目的还是扩兵、筹款、搞枪，没有发动群众减租减息，而是抓一把解决军队本身的问题。四一、四二年忙吃忙穿，以及以后的自力更生，在思想上并没有明确意识到是为了边区三百万人民，而只是为了几万公家人。表现在农业生产上，商业上都有很坏的作风，给予群众以严重恶果，造成脱离群众现象。关于今后部队建设，贺司令员和李政委的报告中，都再三再四的指示军队做群众工作，参加土地改革。指出雇贫农出身的士兵，无有不拥护土地改革者；只有少数地主、富农出身者，认识上还需要教育，是当前的中心任务。因为土地问题得不到解决，农民就无法冲破穷困。从农民阶层涌进军队的士兵，就不能巩固，因而也就不能取得战争的胜利。反之，如果军队参加土地改革，并成为运动的骨干，广泛发动群众，农民都有了土地后，政权才能建好，建党才有基础，战士才能解决“为谁战斗”的重大问题，建军才有好兵。但要达此目的，不仅要从组织上，而且要从思想上来一次革命，彻底肃清军阀主义与流寇思想，才能担任这个任务。为此部队中必须组织群众工作团，由旅、团、纵队、分区、军区一级干部率领，在党委统一领导下参加土地改革工作；各级干部一律轮流参加。连队中要建立副支书，专门领导连队作群众工作，以加深部队的阶级观点。其次，在军队与群众关系上，贺司令员指出：军队要大力帮助群众恢复生产，向群众投资，帮助发展副业，保证一二年内能彻底翻身。为了减轻群众负担，部队实行精简，充实连队，贯彻生产供给会议的精神，各单位将商店全部交公，以克服边区人力物力的困难。贺司令员在其总结报告第二部分中，检讨部队本身建设问题，指出：直到现在，我们部队的管理教育方法还存在着严重的军阀主义倾向，阻碍了民主的开展。贺司令员再三批评那些把军阀主义仅仅陷于打骂的看法，他严肃指出：“在军队来说，凡违背人民利益的思想行动，都是军阀主义的表现”。其次，在经济不民主的情况下，战士生活没有得到应有的改善，而干部中却发生有贪污腐化。今后必须确立这样的思想，我们应该首先为三百万人民服务。在部队内部首先要为广大的战士服务，十分的钟爱他们，不仅照顾他们的本身生活，而且要照顾他们家庭生活。在照顾战士家庭中，又要首先照顾贫农、雇农的成分，认真为他们解决生活问题。对干部首先要照顾连排干部，机关的参谋、干事、科员等，其次才是较高级的干部。贺司令员严重批评了部队政治生活的不健全，和新的形式主义。连队中以一揽子会代替党的活动，使得组织生活非常不健全，大大降低了党的领导作用，这是非常危险的。在总结上述情形后，贺司令员指示：部队今后必须从开展政治民主与经济民主着手。政治民主方面，除战斗命令外，一切生产、练兵、学习等运动，都可发动战士民主讨论。战士可以批评任何干部；对屡不改悔错误的干部，战士可以打报告交支部转上级党委予以撤换。支部工作要大大加强，任何干部党员都要参加小组生活，并向小组作工作的和思想的报告。特别是负领导责任的干部党员，要在小组内提倡民主，自我批评，才能倾听群众的意见。没有这一点，就无法开展党内民主。开展经济民主方面，首先要做到经济公开，以伙食单位建立不是徒具形式的、而是真正代表士兵利益有实际权力的经济委员会。这个经委会在支部领导下，有权召开全连士兵大会，讨论本单位的经济问题。可以随时召集委员，清算账目。各连的经委会，可以联合检查营的经济开支。营的经委会，可以检查团。这样按级类推，一直检查到军区。经济委员会要保证百分之八十的经济用于解决战士问题。只有从这两方面开展群众性的民主运动，连队的问题才能迎刃而解。因此，各级党委要很好的加以领导，如有压制行为，党员有权上诉。在民主运动开始时，发生某些偏差是难免的，干部要用很好的方式去掌握，不要害怕群众运动。只有如此，开展政治和经济的民主运动，才有保障。此外，部队中赏罚必须分明，对于已颁布的惩治贪污与军法条例，必须坚决执行。对有功同志也要奖扬；因之在部队中要大大开展立功运动。记功一定经过全连的战士讨论，才能取得群众的信任，并推动部队前进。这些英雄模范，只要求有一技所长。样样都好，所谓“全面”的要求，必然走向失败；这是为过去英模运动的经验所证明了的。关于军事问题，贺司令员详细解说：我们必须承认敌强我弱、敌大我小的事实，否则就要犯错误。历史证明：承认这一点，而在战役和战斗上集中优势，打击敌人一点，用以把我之劣点变为敌人的劣点，就能战胜敌人；如最近陕甘宁之捷就是明证。反之，如果不承认这个事实，采取分散兵力，就不能造成我之优势敌之劣势，必然招致失败的结果。报告至此，贺司令员重复强调群众的力量，据此检讨几个战役的成败。他引证毛主席的话说：“我们的力量就是小米加步枪，如果看不起小米（即群众力量），必然要走向单纯的军事观点。这支步枪一定不会有何作用。”蟠龙战斗，我军以很少伤亡，换得重大的胜利，就是我们有群众而敌人没有的原故。贺司令员于此着重的说：今后我们还得加强民兵工作，充实群众武装。关于改进军区机关本身工作，贺司令员指出：必须首先克服官僚作风和形式主义，指挥员应深入连队为士兵服务，各级政治部工作都要深达于连队。在总结报告第三部分中，贺司令员号召大家团结自己，战胜敌人。他有力的说：“只有思想上团结得像和睦的家庭一样，才能很快战胜敌人。”但这种团结，并不是而且也不能是以什么个人为中心，一定要以党委为中心，一切问题经过党委讨论。为加强党的领导，决恢复井岗山时期部队的党委制度。各部应按新的党委制度草案，认真进行改进党的工作，发扬党内民主，使之成为全军领导与团结的核心。其次，过去我们常常因为人力物力困难，上下级闹意见，或消极埋怨政府，这都是不对的。我们只有积极帮助群众解决土地问题，群众生活获得改善后，这些困难自然容易解决。贺司令的总结报告，给了与会同志思想认识一个新的提高。报告中贯串阶级路线的工作指示，就是向全军发出的命令。大家一致表示，要把大会精神和贺司令员李政委的指示，坚持不懈的贯彻到实际工作中去。至此大会宣布圆满闭幕。与会同志除一部分参加土地改革工作外，纷纷返回部队，以高度信心迎接新的战斗，新的胜利。
