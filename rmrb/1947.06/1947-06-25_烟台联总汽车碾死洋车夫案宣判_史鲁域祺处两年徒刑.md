Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd. The case of the American UNRRA staff member stationed in Yantai, Shrove, running over and killing rickshaw puller Yang Lu-kui, has been concluded by the Yantai Municipal District Court, which formed a temporary court on the 16th to conduct the trial of the perpetrator, Shrove, and announced the verdict. More than 300 representatives from all walks of life attended as observers, and UNRRA's Lippur and others were also invited to attend. First, the supervisor, Mayor Yao Zhongming, reported on the significance of the trial, pointing out: "It is the first time in China that a law-breaking foreigner has been tried like this. Our law takes the will of the people as the highest principle, and the historical extraterritoriality and consular jurisdiction have been swept away." Then the prosecutor filed the indictment. When the presiding judge inquired about the opinions of Yang Lu-kui's family, Yang's wife complained: My husband died unjustly, I hope the government will handle it according to law, and urge UNRRA to quickly provide compensation to maintain our livelihood. At this time, witnesses Li Wanwei and Wang Xuanqing testified one by one about the situation at the scene of the accident. The formal trial then began. The presiding judge first asked Shrove if he had any defense against the facts of the crime mentioned by the prosecutor. After a brief defense, Shrove admitted all the charges and requested lenient treatment from the government. Then the clerk read the detailed record, obtained Shrove's full consent and signature, and after careful study, the presiding judge announced the verdict: According to the plaintiff's accusations and the defendant's admitted facts, the cause of the accident was due to the defendant's disregard for Chinese human rights, resulting in death, which should be severely punished; however, the defendant expressed remorse, and because he is a UNRRA staff member, in order to take care of international friendship, he is given lenient treatment, and the defendant is sentenced to two years of imprisonment. After the defendant Shrove agreed to be remanded in custody, representatives from all walks of life unanimously expressed their support for the government's verdict, and expressed their willingness to maintain genuine international friendship with UNRRA, and hoped that compensation would be immediately allocated to the families of the deceased to maintain their livelihoods.

    【新华社山东二十三日电】驻烟联总美籍职员纵车碾死洋车夫杨禄奎案件，已由烟台市地方法院于十六日组成临时法庭举行对肇事人史鲁域祺的审判，而宣告结束。是日到各界旁听代表三百余人，联总李普尔等亦被邀列席旁听。首由监审人姚仲明市长报告审判意义，指出：“像这样审判犯法的外国人，在中国还是第一次。我们的法律是以人民的意旨为最高原则，历史上的治外法权和领事裁判权均被一扫而光。”继由检查官起诉。当主审官惩询杨禄奎家属意见时，杨妻诉称：我丈夫死的冤枉，望政府依法处理，并敦促联总速予抚恤费，以维持生活。此时，证人李万维、王宣庆以目睹当场肇祸情形一一证明，即开始正式审判，主审人首问史鲁域祺对检查官所提各点犯罪事实有何申辩，史于简单辩解后，对所犯罪状全部承认，并请求政府宽大处理。继由书记官宣读详细记录，征得史鲁域祺全部同意和签字，并经详细研究，由主审人宣告判决：根据起诉人的控诉及被告人招认的事实，肇事原因系由于被告人轻视中国人权致伤人命，本应严加惩办；但被告表示悔过，并因他是联总职员，为照顾国际友谊，特从宽处理，判决被告有期徒刑两年。被告史鲁域祺同意还押后，各界代表一致表示拥护政府判决，并愿与联总保持真正的国际友谊，望立即拨发死难家属抚恤金，以维持其生活。
