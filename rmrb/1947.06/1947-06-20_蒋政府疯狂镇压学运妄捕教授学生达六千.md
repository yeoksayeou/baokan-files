　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. Shanghai Dispatch: The China International Human Rights Guarantee Association and the Shanghai University Professors Association hosted foreign reporters on the 9th to report on the Chinese student movement. Mr. Liu Wang Liming, representative of the International Human Rights Guarantee Association, first reported that in the past month, the authorities had arrested 1,900 students, professors, and journalists in Wuhan; 1,800 in Fuzhou; 1,000 in Guangzhou; 1,000 in Chongqing and Chengdu; and 266 in Shanghai. Large-scale arrests and secret disappearances of students and journalists occur throughout the country every day. Those arrested are subjected to various beatings, shootings, and tortures. Many professors believe that if the government had accepted the students' petitions, allowed them to state their demands, and not treated them with force, the student movement would not have been so deep and widespread. They also pointed out that the Chiang government's "temporary measures" prohibiting mass parades and demonstrations were illegal and should have been rejected by the Legislative Yuan long ago. The Chiang government's use of troops to abuse students is an even more serious crime.

　　蒋政府疯狂镇压学运妄捕教授学生达六千
    【新华社陕北十八日电】沪息：中国国际人权保障会与上海各大学教授联合会于九日招待外国记者，报告中国学生运动。国际人权保障会代表刘王立明先生首先报告说：过去一月中，当局已在武汉逮捕学生、教授、记者一千九百人。在福州一千八百人，广州一千人，重庆与成都一千人，上海二百六十六人。全国每天都发生大规模的逮捕与学生、记者秘密失踪。被捕的人，都遭受各种毒打、枪杀和酷刑等。许多教授认为：如果政府接受学生的请愿，允许学生陈述其要求，而不以武力对待他们，学生运动不会是这样深入和广泛的，他们并指出：蒋政府禁止群众游行示威的“临时办法”是非法的，早该为立法院否决，蒋政府使用军队虐打学生，罪更严重。
