　　The second group of militia participating in the war effort from Wu'an has carried forward the glorious tradition of the first group, universally and deeply launching the "Love the People" movement. When the stretcher team from the Seventh District stayed in Luzhuang, Fourth District of Anyang, they saw that the local people were eating tree leaves and drinking thin soup. Many people surrounded the door begging for food when the stretcher team ate. They then carried out a movement to visit the poor and ask about the reasons. It turned out that out of seventy-eight households in the village, sixty had been robbed by Chiang Kai-shek's agents. The village head, militiamen, and many innocent people were brutally killed or buried alive. The masses complained one after another, and the stretcher team members were deeply moved. Zhang Yangxi, a peasant who had been liberated, took out ten catties of rice coupons he had brought from home to help the masses. Yang Tiantang led fourteen people to save three bowls of rice a day to feed the poor. The Fifth Brigade of the Eighth District, seeing that the families of military cadres in Dangzhonggang were living in hardship, saved sixty catties of millet for eight families of military dependents and helped them gather firewood, hoe wheat, and dig grass. After the "Visit the Poor" movement was universally launched in the new district, a total of 5,380 catties of millet and 21,000 Jiao of Hebei currency were saved in the seven districts before and after. They also helped the masses carry manure, plow the land, and do many odd jobs. The relationship between the masses in the new and old districts has since become much closer, overcoming various difficulties in participating in the war.

　　武安二批参战民兵
    继续民爱民运动
    【本报武安讯】武安第二批参战民兵发扬了第一批的光荣传统，普遍深入开展民爱民运动。七区担架队住安阳四区炉庄时，看到当地群众吃树叶、喝稀汤，担架队吃饭时很多人围门要饭，他们便进行了访苦问原因运动。原来该村七十八户，就被蒋特抢了六十户，村长、民兵及无辜群众多人，也被惨杀或活埋。群众纷纷诉苦，担架队员多受感动，翻身农民张羊喜把从家带的十斤米票拿出救济群众，杨天堂则领导十四人每天省三碗饭给穷人吃。八区五大队在当中岗看到该村军干属生活艰苦，节约小米六十斤给了八户军属，并帮助军属打柴、锄麦刨草。访苦运动在新区普遍展开后，前后七个区共节约小米五千三百八十斤，冀钞两万一千元，并帮助群众担粪犁地做杂活甚多，新老区群众关系自此大为密切，克服了参战各种困难。
