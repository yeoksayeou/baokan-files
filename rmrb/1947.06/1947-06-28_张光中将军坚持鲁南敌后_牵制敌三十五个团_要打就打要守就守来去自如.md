　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th: A correspondent from this agency interviewed General Zhang Guangzhong, commander of the Southern Shandong Military Region, in a certain area of ​​Southern Shandong, who is persisting in the struggle behind Chiang Kai-shek's lines. General Zhang stated that since the beginning of April, when Chiang Kai-shek mobilized ten brigades to invade the mountainous areas of ​​Southern Shandong, the military and civilians of Jinan have risen up to resist. In the past two months, they have annihilated approximately 6,000 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, successfully executing three major military tasks: (1) Containing Chiang Kai-shek's forces, including the entire 64th Division, 59th Division, and 77th Division, parts of the 75th Division, 83rd Division, and 57th Division, the remnants of the 51st Division, the Parachute General Corps, and the entire New 10th Division of Wu Huawen's puppet troops, as well as the Advance Column, totaling 35 regiments. (2) Coordinating with the main forces on the front battlefield. During the Battle of Menglianggu, they advanced to the Lin(yi)-Fei(xian) highway, cut off the Lin(yi)-Tan(cheng) highway, and threatened the enemy's flanks. (3) Attacking Chiang Kai-shek's puppet district and township governments, "Security Teams," and "Homecoming Legions." General Zhang emphasized that Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the mountainous areas of ​​Southern Shandong repeatedly conducted "mopping-up operations," and their cruelty of burning, killing, and looting far exceeded that of the Japanese invaders; however, the enemy has two major weaknesses: First, weak combat power. Although they outnumber us several times, our army can attack when it wants to attack, defend when it wants to defend, and leave when it wants to leave, and they are unable to stop us. Second, Chiang Kai-shek's army is an enemy of the people, especially raping women, arousing strong resentment among the people of Southern Shandong, who resist them anytime and anywhere. Therefore, Southern Shandong has sufficient conditions to persevere victoriously. General Zhang pointed to the map and explained that although there are many Chiang Kai-shek's strongholds in Southern Shandong, the main transportation lines are still extremely difficult to maintain. The Lin(yi)-Zi(yang) highway and the Tai(erzhuang)-Wei(xian) highway sections still cannot be fully opened to traffic. The area of ​​Fushan (west of Zou County, east of Dushan Lake), west of the Jinpu Railway, which was occupied in March, has been mostly recovered by us, and it is even more difficult for the enemy to achieve area control. Finally, the reporter told him that the Central News Agency constantly broadcasted news of General Zhang's serious injuries. He said: "This is just a trick by the reactionaries to cover up their own failures."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th: A part of the local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Southern Shandong went deep behind enemy lines on the west side of the Jinpu Railway in the Fushan area (west of Zou County, east of Dushan Lake) on the 3rd to sweep away the "Homecoming Legions," and in addition to those killed and wounded, captured 253 Chiang Kai-shek's town and township chiefs and "Homecoming Legion" captains and below.

　　张光中将军坚持鲁南敌后
    牵制敌三十五个团
    要打就打要守就守来去自如
    【新华社山东二十五日电】分社记者在鲁南某地访问了坚持蒋后斗争的鲁南军区司令员张光中将军，张将军首称：自四月初蒋调动十个旅兵力侵入鲁南山区后，晋南军民即奋起抵抗，两个多月中，共歼蒋伪军约六千余人，胜利的执行了三大军事任务：（一）钳制蒋军计有六十四师、五十九师、七十七师等全部，七十五师、八十三师、五十七师各一部，五十一师残部、伞兵总队及伪军吴化文的新十师全部，挺进纵队等共三十五个团。（二）配合正面战场主力作战。在孟良崮战斗时，曾挺进临（沂）费（县）公路，切断临（沂）郯（城）公路，威胁敌人侧后。（三）打击蒋伪区乡公所、“保安队”、“还乡团”等。张将军强调说明：蒋军在鲁南山区反复“清剿”，其烧杀淫掠的残酷远过日寇；但敌人有两大弱点：第一，战力薄弱，人数虽数倍于我，但我军要打就打，要守就守，要走就走，它无力阻止。第二，蒋军与民为敌，特别是奸淫妇女，激起全鲁南人民高度愤恨，随时随地遇到人民的反抗。因此，鲁南有足够的条件胜利坚持下去。张将军复指着地图说明鲁南蒋军据点虽多，但主要交通线仍极难保持，临（沂）滋（阳）公路及台（儿庄）潍（县）公路车段至今不能全部通车。津浦路西三月间被占的凫山区（邹县以西，独山湖以东）纵横四五十里地区已大部为我收复，敌图达到面的控制那更是不易了。最后，记者告以中央社不断播发张将军重伤消息。他说：“这不过是反动派掩饰自己失败的一种手法而已。”
    【新华社山东二十五日电】鲁南二分区地方武装一部，于三日深入津浦路西侧凫山（邹县以西，独山湖以东）一带敌后扫荡“还乡团”，除毙伤外，生俘蒋记镇乡长及“还乡团”队长以下二百五十三人。
