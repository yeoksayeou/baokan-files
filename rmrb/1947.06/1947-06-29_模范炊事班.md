The cooking class of the 5th company of the 2nd regiment of the Qunzi troops, under the leadership of Quartermaster Shao Hongtai and Class Leader Wei Suxiang, has created brilliant work achievements and established a high prestige in the entire company. Their slogans are: "Savings cannot be at the expense of the soldiers' stomachs, but rather by finding ways and improving labor." "Wholeheartedly for the soldiers, for the front lines." Comrade Shao Hongtai, the quartermaster of the company, participates in the company headquarters' office work every day, soliciting opinions from company and platoon cadres and soldiers. During mealtimes, the cooking class comrades listen to the soldiers' opinions in the dining hall, using the soldiers' opinions to measure the quality of their work. They often say, "We must see what the soldiers say. If they have opinions about us, we must answer them well." The whole class often talks in bed at night about how to improve the food. Xu Futian, the comrade who boils the soup, is afraid that the soldiers will not have good soup, so he tries his best to boil the soup well, sparing no effort, and boils four or five pots of soup every day by himself. When it's time to eat, the soldiers ask, "Where is the soup made by Xu Futian?" and they all compete to drink it. "Our dishes are fragrant and fragrant, better than the chicken soup in restaurants..." This is a fast-paced song on the 5th company's bulletin board praising their kitchen's cooking skills.

In early May, the entire company ate a total of 281 eggs, 50 jin of chives, 22.5 jin of white radishes, 41 jin of tofu, 12 jin of cabbage, 20 jin of sesame oil, 14.5 jin of peanut oil, and more than 60 jin of pork and bean sheets, as well as a lot of soy sauce, vinegar, and peppercorns. The 5th company soldiers averaged six qian of oil per day, and each person could eat a small bowl of vegetables per meal. Recently, they have ordered a five-day food plan, eating white flour twice, fried dough sticks once, meatballs once, and not repeating other meals. The whole class launched a revolutionary competition to see who steamed the best steamed buns, sticking their names on the steamer basket with paper and asking the soldiers to evaluate the quality. Their steamed buns are indeed small, soft, and not sour.

During the battle near Anyang, in addition to those left at home to cook, a front-line rescue team was formed to rescue the wounded and supply water to the front. People in the rear competed to send food to the front, a round trip of forty li, braving the artillery fire, without any regard for fatigue or danger, but feeling that going to the front was the most glorious thing. Comrade Zhang Enhai, a cook, said, "Now is the time to perform meritorious service for the people. I am determined to perform great meritorious service. This time, I am determined to go to the front." Seeing the soldiers digging fortifications day and night, fighting the enemy in the trenches, they automatically donated more than two thousand yuan to buy cigarettes, wrote letters of condolence, and sent representatives to the trenches. The letter stated: "Guarantee that the comrades at the front will not go hungry or thirsty, and will be carried down if they are wounded." Comrade Xu Xuxiang, a cook, donated a pair of sock cloth materials that she had saved to the front line to wipe the guns for the machine gun squad, and sent a message saying, "Wipe your guns well and kill more enemies." The moved front-line soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to fight well and respond to the cooking class comrades' concern for them.

Division of labor and cooperation, mutual assistance in everything. The whole class is divided into three groups: stir-frying, boiling soup, and steaming buns. The stir-frying group ensures that there is enough food, good taste, and fragrance, and does not eat soup dishes except for egg soup. The steamed bun group ensures that the steamed buns are small, thin, soft, and thoroughly steamed. The soup boiling group ensures that the soup is boiled, enough to drink, and tastes good. The whole class guarantees that the soldiers will not get sick from food, and that the food is clean and hygienic.

In this battle near Anyang, the cooking class worked day and night, nearly twenty li from the rear to the front, delivering food twice a day. The cooking group, after stir-frying the dishes, automatically helped the rice group cook, and those who finished cooking helped boil water. Class Leader Wei Suxiang ran around everywhere, personally checking the raw and cooked, and the entire cooking staff seemed like a harmonious family. Comrade Cheng Lezhen, who was liberated in the Cao County battle, became ill. Wei Suxiang not only carried all his things on her back, but also tried to treat him, taking out more than a thousand yuan to buy noodles and sesame cakes. Deputy Class Leader Li Qinggong took out four hundred yuan to buy eggs and steamed buns. Cheng Lezhen gratefully said, "Everyone takes care of me when I'm sick, even better than at home." During the march, the cooking class was generally in the rear, and if other classes fell behind near them, they would always carry their things and help them catch up with the team. The cooking class formed a reception team.

Obey mass discipline, and do a good job in mass work. Whether in war or peace, they can obey mass discipline and carry out mass work. Quartermaster Shao Hongtai attaches importance to reading newspapers. Every time a newspaper arrives, he promptly reads it to the cooking class comrades, and the cooks publicize the victory news they hear to the masses. Sometimes, when they start chatting about family matters, the landlords feel that they speak kindly and voluntarily rush to help them light the stove. In the Weixi Zhanglao battle, the rear was very far from the front, and the food could not be delivered in time. Cooking Deputy Class Leader Li Qinggong and cooks Li Qiushan and Guo Wenzhong followed the front troops to boil water. One person boiled the pot, and two people borrowed grain from the landlords, asking the clerk to register the borrowed grain clearly, quickly made the food, and then went to the camp manager to collect the grain and return it to the landlords. When the troops dug fortifications, they destroyed the garlic sprouts in the villagers' gardens. They took the sprouts back, made them into dishes for everyone to eat, and compensated the people with grain. Because of the strict discipline, the masses were extremely grateful. Whoever is responsible for cooking in whose home is responsible for mass discipline. This is their common slogan for mass work. Borrowing furniture must be done through the landlord, and returned on time after use. Class Leader Wei Suxiang is frugal and thrifty on weekdays, and sometimes takes out the money she saves to buy things and invite the landlords. A few days ago, when they moved houses, cook Li Jinshan broke a bowl belonging to the landlord. The troops had already gathered, but he ran back to compensate two hundred yuan of Ji banknotes. He came back and said to the class leader, "Today I broke a bowl belonging to the landlord, and I really felt bad. It's very shameful. I must be careful next time." In several battles in northern Henan, among the thirteen people in the whole class, Class Leader Shao Hongtai and cook Hou Jixiang each received a major merit, Xu Fuchang received two minor merits, Sergeant Zhang Minglun, Deputy Class Leader Li Qinggong, and cook Guo Wenzhong each received a minor merit once, and Zhang Qinghai and Li Qiushan each received four good deeds.

　　模范炊事班
    殷步实　文力 
    群字部队二团五连炊事班，在事务长邵鸿泰、班长魏素香二同志领导下，创造了光辉的工作成绩，在全连树立了高度的威信。他们的口号是：“节约不能从战士肚子里节约，而是靠工作想办法与劳动方面去改进。”“全心全意为战士、为前线”。该连事务长邵鸿泰同志，每天参加连部办公，征求连排干部战士意见。开饭时，炊事班同志在饭堂中听取战士的意见，从战士意见中来衡量自己工作的好坏。他们常常说：“要看战士说怎样，如果对咱有了意见，要好好答复。”全班往往在夜间睡在被窝里交谈怎样搞好伙食的意见。烧汤的徐福田同志怕战士喝不好汤，尽心把汤熬好，不辞劳苦，每天一个人烧四、五锅汤。到开饭时，战士都问：“那里是徐福田作的汤？”都争着喝。“我们的菜，香又香，胜过饭馆的鸡肉汤………”这是五连战士在门板报上歌颂他们的伙房炒菜技术的快板。
    全连在五月份上旬吃的蔬菜，共有鸡子二百八十一个，韭菜五十斤，水萝卜二十二斤半，豆腐四十一斤，小白菜十二斤，香油二十斤，花生油十四斤半，猪肉、粉皮六十多斤，酱、醋、花椒等甚多。五连战士每天平均六钱油，每顿饭一个人都可吃一小碗菜。最近他们订了五天伙食计划，吃两次白面，一次油条，一次丸子，其他不吃重样饭菜。全班发动革命比赛，看谁蒸的馍馍好，用纸把名子沾在蒸馍的笼上，叫战士评好坏。他们馍馍确实又小又软，不发酸。
    该班在安阳附近战斗中，除家里留人作饭外，成立了火线抢救组，抢救伤员，还供给前方烧水。后方的人争着到前方去送饭，来回四十里路，冒着炮火，丝毫不顾疲劳和危险，却感到上前线是最光荣的。炊事员张恩海同志说：“现在为人民立功，我坚决立大功，这次打仗，我坚决上前方去。”他们看到战士日夜挖工事，在战壕和敌人作战，自动捐款两千多元，买了烟，写了慰问信，派代表送到战壕里。信中提出：“保证前方同志不挨饿，不受渴，负伤抬下来。”炊事员徐续香同志把自己节省下一双袜子布材料捐到前线，给机枪班擦枪，并捎口信说：“你们把枪擦好，多打死几个敌人。”感动的前方战士一致表示打好仗，回答伙房同志对我们的关心。
    分工合作，事事互助。全班分炒菜、烧汤、蒸馍三个组。炒菜组保证菜够吃，味道好、香，除鸡蛋汤外，不吃带汤菜。蒸馍组保证把馍蒸的小、薄、软、蒸熟。烧汤组保证把汤烧开，够喝、好喝。全班保证不能让战士从吃食上生病，饭菜清洁卫生。
    在这次安阳附近战斗中，炊事班工作日夜忙碌，后方前方将近二十里，每天送两次饭。作菜组炒好菜，自动帮助饭组做饭，做好饭的帮助烧水。班长魏素香同志到处奔忙，亲自检查生熟，全班炊事员好像一个和睦的家庭。曹县战斗中解放过来的程乐珍同志有了病，魏素香同志不但将他的东西都背上，并设法给他治病，自己拿出一千多元买挂面、买烧饼。副班长李庆功拿出四百元买鸡子和馒头。程乐珍感激地说：“我病了大家照顾比在家还好。”行军中，炊事班一般序列在后面，其他班的掉到他们附近，总是给背上东西，帮助赶上队伍，炊事班形成了收容队。
    遵守群众纪律，群众工作作的好。不论在战时和平时，都能遵守群众纪律，进行群众工作。事务长邵鸿泰同志重视读报工作，每次来报，他就及时地读给炊事班同志听，炊事员把听到的胜利消息宣传给群众听。有时拉起家常事来，房东感到他们说话亲切，都自愿抢着帮他们烧锅。卫西张劳战斗，后方离前方很远，饭不能及时送到，炊事副班长李庆功、炊事员李秋山、郭文仲三同志随着前方部队烧水，一个人烧着锅，两个人向房东借粮食，请文书把借的粮食登记清，很快把饭做好，再到营部管理员那里领回粮食还给房东。部队挖工事，把老乡园里的蒜苗挖毁了，他们将苗拿回来，给大家作菜吃，以粮食赔偿老百姓。由于纪律严明，群众感激不尽。在谁家做饭，群众纪律就由谁负责任，这是他们群众工作的共同口号。借家具都要经过房东，用完按时归还。班长魏素香平日节省俭用，有时拿出省下的钱买东西请房东。前些日子，他们移房子，炊事员李金山同志坏了房东一个碗，部队已经集合了，他跑回去赔了二百元冀钞。回来对班长说：“今天打了房东一个碗，心里真过不去，丢人的很，下次一定要小心着。”在豫北几次战役中，全班十三个人中，班长邵鸿泰、炊事员侯继香各记一大功，徐福昌记两小功，上士张明伦、副班长李庆功、炊事员郭文重各记小功一次，张庆海、李秋山各记四次好。
