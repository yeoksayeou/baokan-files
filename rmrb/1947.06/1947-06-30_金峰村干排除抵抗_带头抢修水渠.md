Jin Feng Village Cadres Overcome Resistance and Take the Lead in Repairing Irrigation Ditches

[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 28th] The Shi Min Jin Feng Village cadres set an example by leading the masses to dig ditches and irrigate the fields. Jin Feng Village was experiencing a severe drought. District cadre Wang Zhejinn was sent to organize the masses to use river water to save the seedlings, deciding to build three long canals along Xigou and Suzhuang Villages. However, most of the masses still had the mentality of waiting for rain and believed that the project was too large to be accomplished. Therefore, the village cadres were determined to take the lead. Cheng Yushan, Cheng Hongfei, Zhang Cunxian, and others contacted several people to start first. But after working for a day, the masses looked down from the East Mountain and saw that the water level was low and the ground was high, and discouragedly said, "It's like trying to reach the sea from across the river, how can a ditch be built?" The next day, they all scattered. The three people then mobilized for another day, explaining to the masses with the experience of building canals in Duanshi: "Water flows upwards even against a wall after a hundred steps. If the three canals are not built, we will bear the wages." On the third day, the masses reluctantly gathered again and said, "Let's just do it blindly!". Village Chief Yan Shanhong, Political Director Yan Qingshan, and the emancipated hero Yan Sijing, along with ten others, also led fourteen students to start from the most difficult section of the rocky cliff, letting the masses repair the flattest section of the fifth section, gradually increasing the confidence of the masses. The old and young of the whole village participated together, and the masses of Zhan Shan Village also rushed to help. All the cadres went to wherever it was difficult to work, and went to wherever there were problems, so from June 5th to 11th, a canal about five li long was built in seven days. Finally, when settling accounts, the masses wanted to increase the wages of the cadres, but all the cadres unanimously refused, saying, "This is our duty to serve the people."

　　金峰村干排除抵抗
    带头抢修水渠
    【本报太岳二十八日电】士敏金峰村干部以身作则领导群众开渠浇地。金峰村旱象较重，一区派干部王哲金去组织群众利用河水抢救禾苗，决定沿西沟、苏庄村修三条长渠，但一般群众仍有等雨思想，并认为工程浩大办不到。于是村干部便下决心带头动工，成玉山、成鸿非、张存贤等三人联络了几个人首先开始，但作了一天，群众从东山向下望去，看见水低地高，泄气的说：“隔河探海还能修成一条渠。”第二天便都散了，三个人又整工动员了一天，他们拿端氏修渠的经验向群众解释说：“水流百步上墙，如果三条渠修不成，工资由我们负担”。第三天群众又勉强集合起来说：“就这样瞎干吧！”。村长阎善宏、政治主任阎青山与翻身英雄阎思敬等十人，亦领上学生十四人从第二段最难下手的石崖开始，让群众修第五段最平坦的，逐渐提高了群众的信心，全村老少一齐参加，占山村群众亦赶来援助，所有干部见那里难干就到那里去，那里有问题就到那里去，所以自六月五日开始至十一日七天中，一条长约五里的水渠修成了，最后结账时，群众要给干部增工资，但全体干部一致拒绝，并说：“这是我们为民应尽的义务。”
