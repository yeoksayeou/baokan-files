Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS Moscow dispatch: Pravda recently published the first part of a lengthy article by Ponomarev detailing the policies of right-wing Social Democrats. The author emphasizes that one of the main issues in the social life of any European country is the issue of united action by the working class. In most continental countries, if the working class unites and is determined to defend the basic interests of the working people, to defend democracy, peace and security, the reactionaries will increasingly lack the strength and possibility to oppose the working class and its will and policies. Ponomarev further emphasized that: But in fact, the line of isolating the Social Democrats, dividing the working class, and openly struggling against the working class party—the Communist Party—has become increasingly clear among many Social Democratic leaders. For the entire two years after the war, the right-wing Social Democratic leaders have been stubbornly engaged in separatist activities. Their headquarters is the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party, especially the International Department of the Executive Committee. During the war, the Labour Party's leading organs took advantage of the opportunity that some old Social Democratic leaders were living in London and established close contact with them. After these expatriates returned to their countries, they united all the right-wing Social Democrats under their guidance to confront the growing democratic forces. Four international conferences of Social Democratic Parties were held from 1944 to 1946, all of which were aimed at reviving many Social Democratic Parties that had gone bankrupt due to the implementation of reactionary policies and making them oppose the Communist Party. This policy of splitting the working-class movement is being carried out by followers of the right-wing elements of the British Labour Party within the European Social Democratic Parties. They are Blum, Daniel, and Meyer and their friends in France, Chun Brussels and others in Belgium, Scherf and Pollak in Austria, Tranmael in Norway, the adherents of Stauning in Denmark, Schuschu in Germany, and Saragat in Italy. The right wings of the Social Democratic Parties in several countries, including France, Italy, Belgium, and Austria, have caused great disasters to the working class and democracy. The British Labour Party leaders have recently paid particular attention to the new democracies, and they have sent delegations from London to these countries to cause divisions. Soon after the Labour Party formed a cabinet in Britain, it persecuted communists in India. A real attack on communists, and also on progressive trade union leaders, is also being carried out in the Union of South Africa. In Greece, where the British Labour government's troops are stationed, hundreds of fighters for national freedom and democracy have been brutally murdered, and thousands of Greek men and women are suffering torture in prisons and on desert islands. Notorious reactionaries, fascist executioners, after escaping the punishment of the Austrian people, are stationed in military camps and are enjoying the protection of the British occupying authorities in Austria; while democrats and communists are the first to be persecuted. In the British occupation zone of Germany, which is under the jurisdiction of the Labour Party government, not only communist organizations, but also those who support the working-class movement and the merger of the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party are persecuted. If the strength of the organized working-class movement does not stop the right-wing leaders of the Social Democratic Party and the Labour Party in time, they will undoubtedly continue their line of violently suppressing democratic forces.

　　社会民主党右翼首领分裂活动
    已使欧陆民主遭受迫害
    真理报发表论文剖析其罪行事实
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表波诺玛列夫详细分析右翼的社会民主党人之政策的长篇论文的第一部分。作者强调称：任何欧洲国家社会生活中主要问题之一，就是统一工人阶级行动的问题。在大多数大陆国家中，如果工人阶级团结起来，决心保卫劳动人民的基本利益，保卫民主、和平与安全，反动派就日益缺乏反对工人阶级及其意志与政策的力量和可能性。波氏又强调指出：但是事实上走向孤立社会民主党，走向分裂工人阶级与走向公开和工人阶级政党——共产党——斗争的路线，在许多社会民主党的首领中间变得越发清楚了。整个战后两年来，社会民主党右翼首领们一直在顽固地从事着分裂活动。其总部就是英国工党的执行委员会，特别是执行委员会的国际部。战时工党领导机关利用一些社会民主党旧时领袖侨居伦敦的机会，便和他们建立了密切的接触。这些侨民回到他们国家后，就在他们的指导下结合了一切右翼社会民主党人，和日益发展的民主力量对抗。一九四四年至一九四六年开了四次社会民主党国际会议，这些会议全都是为了使许多由于实行反动政策而陷于破产状态的社会民主党复苏，并使他们反对共产党。这种分裂工人阶级运动的政策是被欧洲社会民主党内英国工党右翼分子的追随者所进行的。他们就是法国的勃鲁姆、丹尼尔、梅耶和他们的朋友，比利时的纯布鲁撒尔和其他的人，奥国的雪尔夫和波拉克，挪威的特兰涅尔，丹麦的石担宁党徒们，德国的舒属区和意大利的萨拉盖特。包括法、意、比、奥在内的几个国家的社会民主党右翼已使工人阶级与民主遭受巨大的灾难。英国工党领袖们最近特别集中注意于新民主主义国家，他们为了引起这些国家的分裂由伦敦派代表团赴各该国去。工党在英国组阁不久，即在印度迫害共产党员。对共产党的，并且也是对进步的职工联盟领袖之真实进攻，也在南非联邦进行着。在英国工党政府军队驻扎的希腊，数百个为国家自由与民主的战士已被残害，数千希腊男女正在监牢中与荒岛上受着折磨。罪恶昭彰的反动分子们，法西斯绞刑吏们，在他们逃避了奥国人民的惩罚后，又驻于军营中，正享受着奥国英占领当局的保护；而民主人士与共产党员首先就遭到迫害。在隶属工党政府的德境英占区，不仅共产党的团体，而且那些拥护工人阶级运动团体和共产党与社会民主党合并的人都遭到迫害。假如有组织的工人阶级运动的力量不及时制止社会民主党和工党右翼首领们的话，无疑的他们将继续其对民主势力之强暴镇压的路线。
