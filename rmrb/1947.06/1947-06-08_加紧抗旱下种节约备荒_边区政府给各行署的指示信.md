　　Intensify Drought Resistance, Sowing, Conserving, and Preparing for Famine
    Instructions from the Border Region Government to the Administrative Offices

    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Yang and Rong, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Border Region Government, have issued instructions to the Administrative Offices, Commissioners, and County Heads, calling for intensified organization of drought resistance and sowing, conservation, and preparation for famine. The original text is as follows:

    To all Administrative Office Directors and Deputy Directors, Commissioners, and County Heads:

    Most areas of the region have been without rain to this day, and the wheat harvest has been poor. In many places, autumn seedlings have not yet been sown, and the drought is seriously threatening the entire region. Recently, some areas have begun a campaign of emergency sowing for drought resistance, conservation, and preparation for famine, and have achieved preliminary results. However, there are still some areas that are waiting for rain and have not yet formed a drought resistance and emergency sowing campaign. It must be pointed out that if we suffer a disaster this year, the difficulties for the military and the people will exceed those of 1943. Because the current war consumption is unprecedentedly large, even without disaster, military and civilian food supplies are already difficult. After the land reform, the production movement has not yet been widely carried out, and the peasants have not yet completely turned over, so they cannot withstand serious disasters. Especially after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, followed by the US-Chiang attacks, the people have suffered great losses, and both public and private sectors have no grain reserves, and the capacity for mutual assistance and relief is extremely weak. All these situations must be sufficiently estimated. The leadership must carry forward the spirit of overcoming the difficulties of the disasters in 1942 and 1943, list drought resistance and famine preparation as an urgent task at present, use the strength to support the war and lead the land reform, raise the masses' courage and confidence to fight against natural disasters and overcome difficulties, and mobilize and organize the broad masses to enter the drought resistance and emergency sowing, conservation, and famine preparation movement. The work of drought resistance and emergency sowing and famine preparation must be combined with the war and land reform. Ordinary production must be planned and organized; today's drought resistance and famine preparation must be especially planned and organized. Starting from the positive aspect of establishing merit and setting an example, highly develop the heroic leading role of cadres, enlighten and help the masses to calculate accurately and formulate production and famine relief plans. Organize, help each other, and carry out self-reliance in production for a long-term plan. In areas with severe drought, those who have already started should make persistent efforts; areas that have not started should be mobilized as soon as possible and start this work immediately.

    Agriculture is the mainstay. All economic activities should focus on obtaining food. Grain is the most decisive thing for military and civilian food needs. Do not only focus on sideline occupations and relax efforts in agriculture. Areas that have recently rained should seize the opportunity to rush to sow and replant; in areas lacking rain, all possible local resources should be used to organize the carrying of water to plant corn, melons, vegetables, and various early-maturing crops. Where it is possible to dig wells and open canals, water conservancy should be developed immediately according to local conditions. In order to facilitate planting, large labor exchanges or land exchanges can be implemented to ensure that all arable land is planted. In areas where water cannot be carried for planting, as long as it can be plowed and harrowed, it should be plowed and harrowed quickly so that it can be sown after the rain. Widely promote the masses' experience in drought resistance. Agricultural technology departments at all levels should strengthen research and guidance on drought resistance. It is necessary to concretely solve the difficulties of the masses in the process of sowing: such as new turn-over peasants who have nothing to eat, no money to pay wages, and cannot but engage in sideline occupations, which requires as much work as possible to repay work; organize full and semi-labor, mutual assistance and exchange of labor for agricultural and sideline occupations, or take contract work, etc., and pay wages or distribute food after the grain is harvested. Banks should vigorously organize credit cooperatives to lend loans to farmers in difficulty as early as possible to support sowing. Guide sideline activities to exchange as much grain as possible, accumulate fertilizer, prepare for late planting (such as sixty-day millet, soybeans, buckwheat, vegetables, radishes), and manufacture and sell agricultural implements. In areas where there is no experience in mutual assistance in production, a group of cadres should be sent to help the masses organize. In short, at present, all work is for sowing. If the seedlings have emerged from carrying water for sowing, and there is still no rain and there is a risk of drought, the organization of carrying water for irrigation should continue. In the border areas, in addition to combining labor and military affairs and carrying out a blitz for sowing, attention should be paid to protecting the wheat harvest, protecting grain, and launching a mass movement to protect grain. All localities should consider restricting or stopping grain exports. Organize anti-smuggling teams, implement reward measures, and strictly prohibit grain smuggling.

    The slogan of "everyone saves, every family prepares for famine" should be widely proposed and effectively implemented among the masses. Saving a handful of rice in peacetime can save a life when disaster strikes. It is very important to collect substitute foods in a timely manner, and attention should be paid to promoting this. Liuzhuang and Sun'erzhai villages in Weixian, Jinnan, do not smoke or drink, and do not hold banquets for weddings and funerals; Beiliu village in Licheng, Taihang, everyone picks wild vegetables and every family stores grain, which are all very good methods of conserving and preparing for famine. The Central Bureau's instructions on practicing economy must be diligently implemented and penetrate into the masses to create a mass movement of practicing economy. The Border Government calls on everyone to save two to four ounces of rice per day, and government agencies at all levels must earnestly do so. Alcohol consumption is very large, and all localities should also consider restricting or stopping brewing.

    In the face of this impending disaster, our cadres at all levels, in order to support the front line and reduce the burden on the masses, must effectively consolidate village finances and reduce unnecessary expenses to overcome difficulties.

    In areas where the land reform review has not yet ended, the leadership should carefully study the combination methods. The organization should strive for unity as much as possible, the time should be well adjusted, and the necessary meetings should be moved to the evening or during gaps when production cannot be carried out. Strive to do both without error. In areas where the main focus is on mobilizing the masses, attention should also be paid to drought resistance and emergency sowing as much as possible. Farmers' associations should also organize manpower to plant land that has not been distributed, so as to avoid or reduce the amount of abandoned land.

    In short, drought resistance and sowing, conservation and famine preparation, and land reform and the self-defense war are equally important tasks. Administrative personnel at all levels should dedicate all their strength to this movement, lead the broad masses to fight against drought, and make contributions to the people.

### 加紧抗旱下种节约备荒  边区政府给各行署的指示信

　　加紧抗旱下种节约备荒
    边区政府给各行署的指示信
    【本报特讯】边区政府杨、戎正副主席顷向各行署、各专员、县长发出指示，号召加紧组织抗旱下种节约备荒，原文如下：各行署正副主任、专员、县长：
    全区大部地区，至今缺雨，麦已歉收；不少地方秋苗尚未下种，旱象已严重威胁着全区。近来若干地区，已开始进入抢种抗旱节约备荒的运动中，并已初步取得成绩。但还有一些地区，仍老等下雨，还未形成抗旱抢种运动。必须指出：今年如遭灾歉，则军民之困难必将超过四三年。因为当前战争消耗空前巨大，即无灾荒，军需民食已感困难；土地改革后，生产运动还未普遍搞起来，农民尚未彻底翻身，是经不起严重灾荒的。尤其是八年抗战之后，紧接着又是蒋美进攻，人民损失很大，公私均无存粮，互助和救济能力极弱。所有这些情况必须足够的估计到。领导上要发扬四二、四三年克服灾荒困难的精神，将抗旱备荒列为当前一项紧急工作，以支援战争及领导土地改革的力量，提高群众与天灾作斗争，战胜困难的勇气与信心，把广大群众发动组织起来，进入抗旱抢种、节约备荒运动。进行抗旱抢种备荒工作，必须与战争及土地改革相结合。平时生产要有计划有组织；今天抗旱备荒，尤须有计划有组织。从积极方面立功表模着手，高度发挥干部英雄带头作用，启发与帮助群众精确计算，订生产渡荒计划。组织起来，互助互济，生产自救，长期打算。在旱象严重地区，其已着手进行者，应再接再厉；未着手地区，应从速动员起来，立刻开展这一工作。
    农业为主。一切经济活动，以获得粮食为着重点。粮食是军需民食最决定的东西，不要只顾副业，放松对农业的努力。近日落雨地区，应抓紧抢种补种；在缺雨地区，应尽当地一切可能组织担水点种玉茭瓜菜，以及各种早熟作物。在可能打井开渠地方，应即根据各地情况，发展水利。为便于点种，可实行大变工或换地办法等，务使能种的地全种上。在不能担水点种地区，只要能犁能耙的，就赶快犁耙，以便落雨后赶种。广泛发扬群众抗旱经验，各级农业技术部门，应加强抗旱的研究指导。要具体解决群众下种过程中的困难：如新翻身农民没有吃的，没有钱开工资，不能不搞副业，这就需要尽可能以工还工；组织全半劳力，农副业的互助换工或采取包工等形式，于收下粮食后还工资或分粮食。银行要大力组织信用合作事业，把贷款及早贷给困难的农民，以支持下种。指导副业活动，使尽量换回粮食，积蓄肥料，准备晚种（如六十天谷、小豆、荞麦、小菜、萝卜），制造推销农具。在没有生产互助经验的区域，要派一批干部具体帮助群众组织起来。总之，在目前一切工作为了下种。担水下种，幼苗已出，仍不下雨有旱死危险者，应继续组织担水浇灌。在边沿区还要于劳武结合，突击下种之外，注意保卫麦收，保护粮食，开展群众性的护粮斗争。各地应考虑限制或停止粮食出口。组织缉私队，实行奖励办法，严密禁绝粮食走私。
    人人节约，家家备荒的口号，应在群众中普遍提出，切实贯彻。平时省下一把米，灾荒到来救活一条命。及时搜集代食品非常重要，应注意推动。冀南威县刘庄、孙尔寨村不吸烟，不喝酒，红白喜事不摆席；太行黎城北流村人人采野菜，家家储蓄粮食的节约备荒办法，都是很好的。中央局厉行节约的指示，必须努力执行，并深入到群众中去，造成群众性的节约运动。边府号召每人每日节约二两至四两米，各级政府机关都要认真做到。酒的消费很大，各地也应考虑限制或停止酿造。
    在此灾象将成的情况下，我各级干部同志，为支援前线，减少群众负担，必须切实整理村财政，减少不必要的开支以渡过困难。
    土地改革复查尚未结束地区，领导上应很好的研究结合办法。组织要尽量求统一，时间要很好调整，把必须召开的会议，移到晚间或不能进行生产的空隙中去进行。努力做到两不误。在以发动群众为主的地区，也要尽量注意抗旱抢种。没有分配的土地，农会也要组织人力种上，做到不荒地或少荒地。
    总之，抗旱下种、节约备荒，和土地改革、自卫战争是同样重要的工作。各级行政人员，都应在这个运动中供献自己的一切力量，领导广大群众与旱灾做斗争，为民立功。
