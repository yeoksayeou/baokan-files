Simplified Algorithm for Work Point Conversion

　　In order to reduce accounting troubles, after preliminary research, we have come up with a relatively simple work point conversion method, which is introduced below for reference by various regions:

　　I. The calculation standard is based on each person carrying sixty jin of weight and traveling sixty li round trip, which is equivalent to ten points (i.e., one work point). That is, the product of the weight of sixty jin and the walking distance of sixty li is 3,600. Divide the product of the actual weight carried and the actual distance traveled by 3,600 to get the difference in points to be converted (applicable to livestock, people, and vehicles). For example, Zhang San transported grain to Lin County this time, carrying eighty jin of rice for a round trip of one hundred and fifty li. How many work points should be converted? Multiply eighty jin by one hundred and fifty li to get 12,000, and divide by 3,600, which means the difference in points to be converted is 33.3.

　　II. After multiplying jin and li, there is no need for division. Using the "jin scale song" type of method (referred to as the "conversion flow method") to calculate, you can also get the difference in points, which is even simpler. The conversion flow method song:

　　One deduct two seven seven, two deduct five five five, three deduct eight three three, four is one one one, five is one three eight eight, six is one six six six, seven is one nine four four, eight is two two two two, nine is two five, (only nine sentences are enough)

　　For example, regarding Zhang San's grain transportation mentioned above, the product of the actual weight carried and the actual distance traveled is 12,000. Using "two deduct five five five" and "one deduct two seven seven," the resulting fraction is thirty-three and three-tenths.

　　Note: The fraction after division or flow calculation should be calculated to the millesimal place, and rounded to the nearest centesimal. (Qian Wei, Qing Long, Ke Ping, Fu Zhou)

　　出勤折分简便算法
    为了减少算账麻烦，经初步研究，得出比较简便的出勤折分办法，特介绍如下，供各地参考：
    一、以每人负重六十斤往返六十里顶十分（即一个工）为计算标准，即负重量六十斤与走路里数六十里相乘之积三千六百来除出勤实负重量与实走路数相乘之积数，即为应折之差分（牲口人车适用）例如张三这次往林县运粮，担米八十斤往返一百五十里，该折勤分多少呢？就是用八十斤和一百五十里相乘为一万二千，拿三千六除开，即应折差分为卅三分三。
    二、斤与里相乘后，不用归除，用斤称歌式的流法（简称折分流法）算开，也可得出差分，这个办法更简便。折分流法歌：
    一退二七七、二退五五五、三退八三三、四作一一一、五作一三八八、六作一六六六、七作一九四四、八作二二二二、九作二五、（共九句即可够用）
    例如上所说的张三运粮，实负重斤乘实行程里所得之积数一二○○○，用二退五五五，一退二七七所得出之分数就是三十三分三。
    说明：除开或流开之分数，算到厘位为止，厘以下四舍五入。（谦维、庆龙、克平、服周）
