Reporting the Pre-Merit Situation

St. Buddha Hall was originally a very active model village. During the Anti-Japanese War, under the leadership of all village cadres and activists, although the enemy and puppet sweeps were so frequent and brutal, the village never supplied the enemy even once. It was an extremely rare model in production and disaster relief, and had received many awards. It also had many innovations in land reform, army recruitment, war support, and other work. However, after the "democracy" movement last winter and spring, the cadres and activists became dispirited.

The village cadres and activists all adopted a negative attitude of "not seeking merit, but seeking no demerit," which stagnated the village's work. Many village cadres said, "To do the work well, I work day and night, delaying my own work, which is disliked by my wife... Giving everyone help has instead subjected me to everyone's attacks." In particular, Geng Lanyu, the former chairman of the farmers' association, had consistently been active and meticulous since he started working, with a straightforward nature, pure character, and willingness to take responsibility. Last year, when recruiting soldiers and supporting the war, village cadres such as Shi Decai and Geng Lanxiang were all ill, but he ran around, often forgetting to eat for days and not sleeping day and night. Because of the heavy workload, he often wore a stern face while fulfilling the tasks, and was "bitten hard" in the "democracy movement" for his "bad attitude," finally forcing him to find a way to resign from the position of chairman of the farmers' association. Labor hero Shi Decai was also a leader who was always loved by the masses. He not only led various tasks in St. Buddha Hall, but also led the work in the nearby Sijiazhuang. In the "democracy" movement, the criticism of "doing everything for the masses" dampened his spirits, and his work also became dispirited.

They showed great disrespect for the district leadership and passively resisted the work assigned by the district. When the district sent general cadres to lead, they reported back, "St. Buddha Hall is a village that was built by Political Commissar Zhang. Our small cadres can't lead it!" This also affected the disunity among the district cadres. Even when Political Commissar Zhang came to lead in person, they just responded without action. The resolute obedience to the leadership and the vigorous spirit in various tasks that had been seen in the past few years were no longer visible.

They were no longer active in leading the masses to develop production and become prosperous. St. Buddha Hall had formed mutual aid teams during the disaster relief period, and under the leadership of labor hero Shi Decai and others for several years, it had become a famous model village for mutual aid. Not only did it overcome the disaster, but it also became greatly prosperous because of mutual aid. However, since this spring, due to the village cadres' relaxation of leadership, most of the mutual aid teams have become less enthusiastic. Although they have not completely disbanded, they are much more disorganized than before.

Breaking Down Ideological Obstacles

The People's Daily editorial "Salute to the District and Village Cadres" was transmitted to the village on the night of May 4th. After the resident village cadres led discussions, the minds of most cadres and activists were shaken. The resident village cadres found typical figures and conducted individual interviews. Many cadres felt very sorry when comparing their past history with their current dispirited state.

But they thought, "What's the point of talking about that? Can you say you're not doing the work?" Some suspected, "In the past, they always talked about shortcomings, why are they now telling us to report merits and talk about advantages?" "If you ask me to talk about shortcomings, I can say a lot, but I can't say anything about advantages?" Some very honest cadres, such as Geng Lanyu, said, "What merits do I have? I can't speak well, is doing a little work a merit? Only those who can speak well have merit?" In fact, these cadres have the greatest merit.

Another major obstacle was that they were afraid of losing face and embarrassed to talk about their own advantages. They were also afraid of being ridiculed and even attacked by others for saying them, so they generally held the idea that "A blind mother holding a bald baby, who else is going to praise if you don't praise yourself?" When it was said that "reporting merits is to find leaders from the long-term work in the past to better carry out the great production movement in the liberated areas in the future...," their thinking was passively thinking, "Without leaders, who doesn't know how to produce and farm?"

When talking about their village's past struggles with the enemy, the situation of mutual aid production, and the innovations in land reform, they felt some nostalgia. But they were also hindered by another kind of future concern, that is, you are not cadres who have been here for a long time, and after you leave, will the village not be "democracy," "criticism," and "struggle" again? Thus, a very serious "pile-up thought" was generated, "Anyway, I've done so much in the past, there's nothing to say!"

However, in casual conversations with many people, everyone mentioned how they fought the enemy, how they responded to the call of the superiors to rescue the disaster during the great famine, how they led the rescue of more than 300 people from the disaster in the delivery of public grain and pulling of plows, and how they thought of ways to enable the masses to be liberated in land reform, so the leadership affirmed that they would restore and give play to their enthusiasm and creativity through reporting merits.

Situation Gradually Deepens

After understanding the past situation of St. Buddha Hall, the ideological obstacles before reporting merits, and the current urgent needs of the masses for spring plowing and production, a merit reporting mobilization was quickly carried out for all village cadres and activists. The People's Daily editorial "Salute to the District and Village Cadres" was explained in detail to all village cadres and activists, followed by telling everyone about the new situation of the current patriotic self-defense war, pointing out that the Party Central Committee called on the entire liberated area to mobilize and "fully prepare for the great counter-offensive," the front line is continuing to win victories; factories are also actively increasing production to support the front line; every rural area must also produce more to support the front line. To complete such a great task, we must lead the masses more actively and humbly to do our various tasks well, but everyone's enthusiasm is still insufficient.

Immediately afterwards, combined with the then urgent rush planting, it was explained that reporting merits would not delay production. The mutual aid teams would rush planting during the day, and meetings would be held at night to report merits. Under such tense circumstances of rush planting, everyone should rush to report merits as soon as it started. Whoever reports merits first will have made the first merit. At this time, the leadership also estimated that the past passive practices had left obstacles to today's active practices of promoting advantages, so it was finally specifically pointed out that it is best to report automatically at the beginning of reporting merits. If it is not automatic, everyone should nominate those with the greatest merits to report first.

That night, after the mobilization meeting, the resident village cadres found individual cadres and activists with low morale to enlighten and guide them, discovered their advantages and achievements, and mobilized them to report merits. The next day, they continued individual mobilization and brewing while working. After such intensive and repeated mobilization, the emotions of many cadres began to change. The most typical change was Geng Lanyu. On that day, he took time to shave off his hair that had been growing for more than two months, changed his past dispirited mood of being estranged from the masses, and got along with everyone in a harmonious manner, joking and laughing.

Entering the merit reporting stage, although everyone said they dared to report before the meeting, everyone still hesitated and did not speak after the meeting. Immediately, Shi Decai and Geng Lanyu, who were considered by everyone to have the greatest merits, were nominated to report first. In order to prevent them from daring to report all their merits, it was also called upon that everyone could add to the report after they finished reporting. We will never bury anyone's merits. From then on, the merit reporting situation was opened.

After the situation was opened, it was discovered that cadres with small merits were not active. Therefore, individual cadres and activists with small merits were mobilized again, their merits and achievements were discovered, and they were also guided to report merits. For those who did not know what merit was, it was explained to all cadres and activists, "Anything good done is merit." After gradually deepening in this way, it was discovered that people who reported at the beginning did not dare to report much, and regretted it when they saw others reporting more. Therefore, it was proposed again, "Those who forgot when reporting at the beginning can still add to the report." At this point, the merit reporting movement among all village cadres and activists was deepened.

When the merit reporting movement developed to a considerable depth, the leadership seized the opportunity to further explain to all village cadres and activists, "Our merits and achievements must not only be known to the leadership and all village cadres and activists, but must also be known to the masses. Only in this way can we establish a banner for the masses, and we ourselves will be more glorious. The masses see our advantages and disadvantages very clearly. At the merit reporting meeting, we will still report advantages and merits first, but our cadres and activists must first examine and correct their own shortcomings and mistakes." So everyone happily and cheerfully conducted self-criticism and corrected mistakes. Further strive to add merit on top of merit.

　　认识功劳鼓舞情绪
    圣佛堂村干表功表模
    一农、陆昆、邦信
    表功前的情况
    圣佛堂原来是一个工作很活跃的模范村。抗日战争中，在全体村干和积极分子领导下，虽然敌伪扫荡那样频繁与残酷，该村一次都没有资过敌。生产救灾中更是罕见的模范，曾得过很多奖励。土地改革中和参军、战勤等工作中，也有很多创造。但在去冬今春的“民主”运动后，干部和积极分子工作消沉下来了。
    村干积极分子都抱着“不求有功，但求无过”的消极应付态度，使这村工作停滞不前。很多村干都说：“为了把工作做好，黑天白日的干，耽误了自己的活，遭到老婆的不喜欢………。给大家办了事反而受到大家的打击。”特别是前任农会主任耿兰玉自参加工作以来，一贯的积极细心，性情耿直，品质纯正，勇于负责。在去年参军参战时，石德才、耿兰香等村干都病倒了，他一人东跑西奔，往往一天一天的忘了吃饭，日以继夜的不睡觉。因工作繁重在充分的完成任务中，常常是板着脸，被一些人在“民主运动中死咬住”“态度不好”，终于逼着他设法推掉农会主任的职务。劳动英雄石德才，也是一贯为群众所爱护的领袖，他不仅领导着圣佛堂的各种工作，还兼着领导附近司家庄的工作。在“民主”运动中，“包办代替”的意见打击了他的情绪，工作也消沉下来。
    对区的领导表现很不尊重，区里工作布置下来，消极抵抗。区里派一般干部来领导，回去汇报：“圣佛堂是张政委一手领导起来的村，咱们小干部领导不了！”又影响区干间的不团结。张政委亲自来领导，也只是应而不动，过去几年来那样坚决服从领导、那样对各种工作生气勃勃的气象，再看不见了。
    对领导群众生产发家也不积极了。圣佛堂自灾荒时生产救灾即组成了互助组，几年来在劳英石德才等领导下，成为了有名的互助模范村，不仅战胜了灾荒，而且因互助大大发了家。可是今春以来，由于村干们放松了领导，互助组也多不起劲，虽未完全散伙，但比起以前涣散多了。
    打破思想障碍
    人民日报“向区村干部致敬”的社论，五月四日夜里传到该村，坐村干部领导酝酿闲谈后，大部分干部和积极分子的脑子就起了动荡。坐村干部找了典型人物进行了个别了解，许多干部对自己过去的历史和现在的消沉比较起来感到非常惋惜。
    但是他们心里想着：“说那顶啥事，工作叫做还能说不做？”有的怀疑“过去都是说缺点，为什么现在又叫表功劳说优点？”“若叫我说缺点，我能说一大堆，说优点我可一点也说不出来？”有的很老实的干部例如耿兰玉则说：“咱有啥功？又不会说不会道，作点事还算功？人家能说会道的才有功？”其实这种干部功劳最大。
    另一个最大的障碍就是碍于情面，不好意思的说出自己的优点；还怕说出来受到别人讽刺以致打击，就普遍怀着：“瞎娘抱着一个秃娃娃，人家不夸自家夸”等思想。说到“表功是为了从过去长久的工作中找到带头的，把今后解放区的大生产运动搞的更好………”但他们的思想则是消极的认为：“没带头的，谁还不知道生产种地？”
    谈到他们村里过去和敌人的斗争，互助生产的情形，土地改革中的创造等，他们又有些留恋。但是又为另一种未来的顾虑作障碍，即你们不是长在这里的干部，走了村里还不又是“民主”、“批评”、“斗争”？于是产生很严重的“论堆思想”，“反正过去作了那么一堆，没啥说的！”
    可是在和不少人闲谈中，大家都提到和敌人如何斗争，大灾荒中如何响应上级抢救灾荒的号召，推公粮、拉犁中如何领导从灾荒中救活三百多人，以及土地改革中如何想办法使群众得到翻身等，以是领导上乃肯定通过表功来恢复与发挥他们的积极性和创造性。
    局面逐步深入
    从了解圣佛堂过去的情况和表功前的思想障碍以及目前群众春耕生产的迫切要求后，就很快的向全体村干和积极分子进行报功动员。把人民日报“向区村干部致敬”的社论，向全体村干和积极分子作了详细的解释，继则把目前爱国自卫战争的新形势说给大家，指出党中央号召全解放区动员起来“全力准备大反攻”，前线正在继续打胜仗；各工厂亦在积极增加生产支援前线；每一个农村也要多生产来支援前线。要完成这样伟大的任务，要更积极虚心的带领群众，把我们各种工作做好，但大家的劲头仍然不足。
    紧接着，就结合当时紧急的抢种，说明表功不耽误生产，白天互助组抢种，夜里开会表功，在抢种这样紧张的情况下，一开始报功，大家就应该抢着报，谁要最先报功，谁就是立了头一功。这时候领导上也估计到过去消极的作法给今天发扬优点的积极作法留下的障碍，所以最后特别指出一开始报功时，最好是自动报，如果不自动的话，大家推举功劳最大的先报。
    当晚，动员会后，坐村干部，就找个别情绪低落的干部和积极分子启发诱导，发现他们的优点和成绩，动员他们报功。第二天在做活中继续个别动员，分别酝酿。经过这样抓紧时间翻复动员，许多干部情绪开始转变，最典型的变化就是耿兰玉，当天抽空剃光了两个多月的长头发，转变了过去和群众疏远的消沉情绪，和大家打打闹闹说说笑笑的融洽起来。
    进入报功阶段，虽然会前大家都说敢报，开会后，大家依然犹豫不开口。马上由推举出大家认为功劳最大的石德才、耿兰玉两人先报。为了防止他们不敢把功全报出来，又号召自己报完了，大家还可以补报，我们决不埋没人家的功劳。从此报功的局面就打开了。
    局面打开后，又发现功劳小的干部不积极。因此对功劳小的干部和积极分子又进行个别动员，发现他们的功劳和成绩，也诱导他们报功。对不知道什么是功的人，当着全体干部和积极分子说明“凡是做的好事都是功。”由此逐步深入之后，又发现了开始报的人也不敢多报，见别人报的多了，自己又后悔。所以又提出了：“最初报时忘了的，仍然可以补报。”至此，在全体村干和积极分子中的报功运动就深入下去。
    在报功运动发展到相当的深入阶段，领导上就抓紧时机向全体村干和积极分子进一步说明：“我们的功劳和成绩不仅要领导上和全体村干、积极分子知道，还必须叫群众都知道，这样才能给群众树立起旗帜，自己也才更光荣。群众对咱们的优点和缺点都看的很清楚。报功会上仍先报优点和功劳，但咱们干部和积极分子的缺点和错误，首先自己要检讨纠正。”于是大家就很高兴很愉快的进行自我检讨和纠正错误。进一步争取功上加功。
