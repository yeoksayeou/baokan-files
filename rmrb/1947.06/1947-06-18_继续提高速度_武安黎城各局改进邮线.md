　　Continue to Increase Speed
　　Wu'an and Licheng Bureaus Improve Postal Routes
　　[This Newspaper] To increase the speed of mail delivery, the Wu'an ×× Bureau has reorganized its trunk and rural postal routes and established direct receiving and dispatching relationships. This has increased the speed of newspapers in the Hecun area by two and a half days, and those sent from the Taihang District Bureau by three days. The Wu'an Bureau's cooperation with the ×× Bureau's improvement measures has also resulted in significant improvements. This adjustment and improvement has improved the connection of postal delivery, eliminated detours of mail, and generally increased the speed of delivery. The original five and six districts of the Licheng Bureau, which were on an alternate-day system, have now been changed to a daily system, doubling the postal delivery time in all six districts of the county. (Yu Qing, Yi Yun)
　　[This Newspaper] The Pingshun Post Office accurately calculated the mileage of the trunk lines and changed Route 7 to a daily system, increasing the speed by one day compared to before. Because the Zhang River affected the speed in the third and fourth districts, a river line was set up to overcome the difficulty of being unable to deliver due to rising river water. All employees discussed the need to adhere to the daily system and strive to go home less often. Postal worker Niu Jiqing delivered mail to the second and seventh districts, a round trip of one hundred and fifty li, and returned before sunset. Everyone praised him as "Flying Legs." (Lu Ying)

　　继续提高速度
    武安黎城各局改进邮线
    【本报讯】武安××局为增加邮递速度，重新整顿干线与乡邮线，建立直接收发转递关系。使和村一带的报纸增快两天半，太行区局发去的增快三天。武安局配合××局改进办法，也有很大改进。经过这样的调整改进了邮递上的衔接扫除了邮件的绕路，普遍增快了时间。黎城局原五、六区是隔日制现均改为逐日制，全县六个区邮递时间都增快了一倍。（毓清、一耘）
    【本报讯】平顺邮局精确计算干线里数，在七号改成逐日制，较前速度增快一天。因三、四区有漳河影响速度，又架设起河线，克服了河水上涨无法投递之困难。各员工同志讨论了要坚持逐日制争取少回家，邮工牛吉庆到二、七区投递往返一百五十里，太阳没落即回来了，大家称赞他是“飞毛腿。”（路英）
