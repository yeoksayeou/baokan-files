　　The Review Movement in Shou Zhang
    Yang Cunfu
    Before January, Shou Zhang County underwent preliminary land reform, and the masses obtained some land. However, in many villages, landlord henchmen were in power, only carrying out sham struggles. The landlords still had a lot of land, houses, and hidden property. When distributing the fruits of victory, the difference between middle and poor peasants was minimal, the poor peasants did not gain much land, and they did not truly rise up. Many village cadres were threatened and bought off by landlords, harboring the backward idea of "If I treat the landlords too harshly now, they can treat me harshly when the tables turn." When the topic of reviewing feudalism was raised, they would say, "It's almost done, there's not much left, let's move on to production!"
    The unfolding of the review movement began with organizing work teams to go to the countryside. Through investigation, they exposed the landlords' false enlightenment, false struggles, hidden farmer association lists, and "changing fortunes diaries" (accounting for the future reversal of fortunes), thereby awakening the village cadres and the masses. Secondly, administrative power and the power of the masses were used to strictly control unlawful landlords and severely punish various acts of sabotage, so that the masses quickly and thoroughly believed in the leadership and dispelled their worries. Thirdly, the old village cadres were educated separately; those with good backgrounds who were more easily enlightened were prompted to reflect on their mistakes; those who hindered the review were given concentrated training and education. Finally, and most crucially, the focus was on the poor peasants, holding meetings and small gatherings, allowing them to rise up and take power. They were encouraged to universally express their grievances and organize review committees of twenty or thirty people, mainly poor peasants, with good old village cadres also participating. For the fruits of victory that middle peasants had gained more of under the old distribution principles, cases were no longer reopened, but the poor peasants negotiated with the middle peasants, saying in a friendly way "you can't eat it all, and I don't have enough," and agreed to "struggle again to get more to give to us (referring to the poor peasants)," which the poor peasants were also happy with. At the beginning, some people worried that the poor peasants would come up empty-handed, unable to struggle for anything, but in the end, they struggled for more than before, supplementing the poor peasants and even distributing some to the middle peasants, making everyone happy, and uniting the middle and poor peasants to deal with the landlords.
    In the struggle against the landlords, the peasants recounted all the crimes of oppression and exploitation by the landlords, and the leadership let the peasants vent their anger and take revenge. The specific handling was decided by the peasants themselves through discussion, and the leadership firmly supported them.
    Many backward peasants (even members of the farmers' association) who had been threatened and lured by the landlords to hide valuables and help landlords evade debts, raised their class consciousness during the peasants' trial of the landlords and voluntarily confessed, foiling the landlords' conspiracy to divide the peasants.
    After the distribution of the fruits of victory, villages held rallies to celebrate liberation and commend model workers, and the peasants showed unprecedented jubilation, and many heroes and models were selected. Within a few days, 3,500 young men in the county enthusiastically joined the army.

　　寿张的复查运动
    杨村夫
    一月份以前，寿张县经过初步土地改革，群众获得一部土地，但有许多村地主爪牙当权，只进行过假斗争，地主的土地房屋与隐蔽财产仍然很多。分果实时，中贫农差额极小，贫农获地不多，亦未真正抬头。许多村干被地主威胁收买，存在“我现在对地主高高手，将来天变了地主也能对我高高手”的落后思想。提到复查封建，他们便说：“差不多啦，没啥啦，转生产吧！”
    复查运动的开展，首先是组织翻身队下乡，经过调查，向村干部与群众揭发了地主的假开明、假斗争，暗藏农会名单，被斗日记（变天账），以此惊醒村干部与群众。其次是运用行政力量与群众力量严密控制不法地主、严厉制裁各种破坏活动，使群众很快的彻底相信领导，解除顾虑。再次是对老村干部，分别进行教育；成份好，较易觉悟的，启发其反省错误；阻碍复查的则集中训练，加以教育。最后，也是最中心的关键，就是面向贫农，召开贫农大会、小会，让他们抬头当权。启引他们普遍诉苦申冤，组织二、三十人的以贫农为主的复查委员会，好的老村干也参加。对中农在旧分配原则下多得的果实，不再翻案，但贫农对中农进行了“合合乐”“你吃不了，我不够吃”，商定“再斗出来补给俺（指贫农）”这贫农也很乐意。开始时有些人怕贫农会扑空，斗不出来什么，但结果斗出来的比以前还多，补足了贫农还又分给中农一点，大家都很高兴，中贫农团结一致，对付地主。
    在对地主斗争中，农民诉出了地主一切压迫剥削的罪恶，领导上放手让农民出气报仇。具体如何处理，由农民自己讨论决定，领导上则坚决支持。
    有不少落后农民（甚至农会员），曾受地主威胁利诱，代藏贵重物品，帮地主赖账，都在农民审判地主时，提高了阶级觉悟，自报出来，地主分裂农民的阴谋破产了。
    果实分配后的村庄，都召开庆祝翻身、表扬模范的大会，农民表现出前所未有的狂欢，选出来不少英雄模范。全县数日内即有三千五百名青壮年踊跃参军。
