　　Jilin Border Area
    Men and Women Eagerly Participate in War Support
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 8th] The masses in the Jilin northern border area, under the slogan "Support the front, do not neglect farmland," are organized. First, militia combat teams were established to follow the main force troops to escort prisoners and transport spoils of war. Now, all the prisoners from Wang Mi Feng have been sent to the rear. The transportation team in Taiping Mountain goes to the supply station every day to carry grain and engages in competitions. Another large cart transportation team was organized, which completely transported more than 10,000 jin of fodder purchased by the team in the village within twelve days. When they are dispatched, everyone helps cultivate the land at home. The masses in Shili Village repaired roads in advance for the convenience of military transportation, and adopted the method of dividing responsibilities by village. Women, old people, and children in various places participated in production and war support. Women and old men in Xiangshui Hezi Village organized teams for milling rice, washing clothes, sewing, fetching water, and boiling water. Only one cadre is left in the village every day to lead the war support for the entire village. The masses in Daping Mountain Village used the method of going to the fields early, harvesting late, and not going home for lunch, which can increase work by two hours a day, making up for the lack of labor in production and war support.

　　吉林边沿区
    男女踊跃参加战勤
    【新华社东北八日电】吉（林）北边沿区群众，在“支援前线，不荒耕地”的口号下，组织起来。首先成立民兵参战队，跟随主力兵团担任押送俘虏与搬运战利品，现已将汪密峰的俘虏全部送到后方。太平山的运输队，每天到兵站去背粮，并展开竞赛，另组织大车运输队，十二天内把车队在该屯所购到的万余斤草料，全部运送完毕。他们出动时，家中地由大家帮助耕种。十里屯群众为了便于军事运输，事先修路，并采取以屯为单位分段负责的办法，各地妇女老幼均参加生产与战勤，响水河子屯妇女老头组织有舂米、洗衣、缝纫、挑水、烧水等组。屯中每天只留一干部在家，领导全屯战勤。大平山屯的群众，用早下地，晚收犁，午间不回家吃饭的办法，每天可多干两个钟头的活，弥补了生产战勤中劳力的不足。
