Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: According to TASS from Beirut: Lebanon held a parliamentary "election" on May 25th. On that morning, cities were filled with military police, tanks, armored vehicles, and infantry units stationed in important squares, streets, and near polling stations. Only voters who expressed agreement with the candidates on the government's election list were allowed to approach the polling places, and protesters were beaten. Lebanese newspapers protested to the government about this "election." The As-Sayyad Arab newspaper stated: "The Beirut and other electoral district elections should be canceled. May 25th was a dark day in Lebanese history." The former Secretary-General of the Lebanese Communist Party, Farajallah Helou, wrote in the newspaper: "The Lebanese election on May 25th, in the true sense, was not a parliamentary election, but a deception of the people and a blatant violation of freedom and fundamental democratic principles. The government relied on terror and tricks, mobilizing all armed forces to ensure the victory of the list of candidates supported by the government, even shooting at voters." He also revealed the participation of Anglo-American imperialist agents in the preparation work for the election, especially in the activities of formulating the list of candidates. Al-Yarmouk newspaper said: "The people will refuse to recognize the forcibly elected members of parliament. These members represent those who practice trickery, not the people." Al-Risala newspaper said: "After the May 25th election, a gap exists between the government and the people." The Lebanese National Federation (a joint organization of various democratic parties in Lebanon) also issued a declaration condemning the government's violent actions during the parliamentary election, urging the people to unite and fight for liberation from oppression and exploitation. Archbishop Khalid received many representatives who came to accuse and protest the parliamentary sham election, and allowed them to convene a general assembly of Lebanese church voters to discuss the demands to invalidate the sham election.

　　由美国在幕后操纵
    黎巴嫩举行伪选
    人民纷纷要求将伪选取消
    【新华社陕北二日电】据塔斯社贝鲁特讯：黎巴嫩于五月二十五日举行议会“选举”。该日清晨，城市中满布军警宪兵、坦克、装甲车及步兵部队驻扎于重要的广场、街道上，以及投票站附近。而且只准许那些表示同意选举政府名单中候选人的选民接近投票处，抗议的人，则被殴打。黎巴嫩各报纸，对于此次“选举”，纷纷向政府提出抗议。圣亚希莎拉伯报称：“应当取消伪选的贝鲁特和其他选举区的选举。五月二十五日是黎巴嫩历史上黑暗的一天。”前黎巴嫩共产党总书记牙拉尤利亚·基拉在该报上撰文称：五月二十五日黎巴嫩的选举，在真正意义上讲并不是国会选举，而是对人民的愚弄，及对自由与基本民主原则公然的侵害。政府依靠恐怖和诡计，动员了所有的武装部队来保记政府所支持的候选人名单的胜利，甚至枪击选举人。他并揭露了英美帝国主义的代理人对选举的准备工作之参与，特别是在制定候选名单时的活动。亚尔·亚玛尔报说：“人民将拒绝承认强制选出的议员。这些议员代表施行诡计的人们，而不是代表人民。”亚尔·黎什尔报说：“五月二十五日选举之后，政府和人民之间存在了鸿沟。黎巴嫩国民联合会（黎巴嫩各民主政党的联合组织）亦发表宣言，谴责举行议会选举时政府的暴力行动，敦促人民团结起来，为从压迫和剥削下解放出来而斗争。耶苏教大主教哈里多接见许多前来控诉和抗议议会伪选的代表，并允许他们召开黎巴嫩全体教会选民大会，以讨论关于使伪选无效的要求。
