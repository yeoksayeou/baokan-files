　　Licheng Villages
    Dig Canals and Wells for Long-Term Drought Resistance
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Most villages in this county have completed sowing. The leadership has proposed "preparing for long-term drought resistance, practicing thrift, and preparing for famine," and has organized the masses to recall the history of drought resistance struggles in 1943 and 1945. The masses are determined to fight against the disaster for the long term, and to find food from the struggle. In the three natural villages of Nanzhuang and Beizhuang, 62 people were used in two days to repair a three-li long canal, which can irrigate 150 mu of land. Eighty mu of land has already been irrigated. Under the leadership of labor hero Guo Changqun in Yuanquan, 130 workdays were used in five days to repair a small canal, which can irrigate 42 mu of land. Villages lacking water, such as Mu＠ and Yan Jing, are digging wells and ponds to prepare for large-scale water storage. The method: Except for military families, households with people and livestock are assigned work according to the number of people and livestock. Digging is carried out through mutual aid teams through unified exchange of labor; in addition, each village is opening up dry canals. While fighting long-term drought, the masses are organized to recall the painful life of famine years, and it is proposed: "A trickle lasts long, production should be thrifty to prepare for disaster." In the discussions among the masses in each village, it was proposed: "Thrift should start from the mouth of the jar," "Production must also be thrifty," "Cannot forget hunger after being full." Huoxiangdao proposed that each person should save one or two liang of rice per day, and women should spin an extra half a liang of cotton. By the end of the year, 5,000 jin of rice (300 people in the whole village) and 560 jin of cotton can be saved. (Yang Ke)

　　黎城各村
    开渠掏井长期抗旱
    【本报黎城讯】本县大部村庄下种完毕，领导上提出：“准备长期抗旱节约备荒”并组织群众回忆四三、四五年抗旱斗争历史，群众决心长期与灾荒作斗争，从斗争中找饭吃。南庄、北庄水浇三个自然庄，两天用了六十二个人即将三里长的一条水渠修通，能浇一百五十亩地，现有八十亩地已经上了水。源泉在劳动英雄郭长群领导下五天内用了一百卅个工修了一条小渠，可浇地四十二亩，墓＠、岩井等缺水村都在掏井挖池准备大量储积水。其办法：除军属外凡有人与牲口户根据其人与牲口数量摊工，通过互助组统一变工来挖；另外，各村正开旱渠；与长期抗旱斗争同时，组织群众回忆灾荒年的痛苦生活，提出：“细水长流，生产节约准备灾荒。”各村群众讨论中，提出了：“俭省要从缸口起”，“生产还得会俭省”，“不能一饱忘百饥”，火巷道提出每天每人节约一两米，妇女多纺半两花，到年底就能节省五千斤米（全村三百口人），多纺五百六十斤花。（杨柯）
