　　[This dispatch from Taiyue, 16th] The Meng County militia is fiercely launching offensives, carrying out struggles to protect villages and secure the wheat harvest. The strong guerrilla group formed by the Meng County militia, since the beginning of the wheat harvest on May 23rd, has proactively wedged itself into the Huagong, Nanzhuang and other areas on both sides of the Meng (County) Wen (County) Highway, controlling dozens of miles of beachhead positions along the Yellow River. Their slogan is "Fight back, persist in guerrilla warfare behind Chiang's lines!" The militia of the Second District, in coordination with a company of local troops, launched an attack on Miaodi, Nanzhuang, Huagong, Dongmenggang and other places on May 24th, capturing alive 12 Chiang Kai-shek puppet "reserve team" members and counter-reckoning ringleaders, seizing nine rifles, one pistol, and more than 700 rounds of ammunition. On the 25th, the Second District militia captured nine people, including the puppet District Chief Bai Youlan, in Miaodi, seizing nine rifles, three pistols, and one telephone. On the 29th, the Meng County Public Security Team engaged in a fierce battle with six times their number of enemy troops in Majiyi, killing and wounding 18 enemy soldiers. In total, 48 enemy soldiers were annihilated in eight days, controlling most of the villages in the Second and Third Districts, and sheltering the masses during the rush harvest.

　　[This dispatch from the Northern Henan Front, 15th] The Chiang Kai-shek army's 66th Division, 32nd Division, and 41st Division, which had retreated to Jixian County on June 1st, once again invaded north on the 12th. At noon on the 13th, their vanguard, the 66th Division, with approximately three regiments, attacked Qixian City. After inflicting casualties on the enemy, a portion of our army in the city actively withdrew from the city to fight in the suburbs.
