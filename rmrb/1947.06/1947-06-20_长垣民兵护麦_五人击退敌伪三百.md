Changyuan Militia Protects Wheat
Five Men Repel 300 Enemy and Puppets
    [Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 18th] Our Changyuan Eighth District militia, protecting the wheat harvest, created a glorious battle example of five men defeating three hundred enemies. At 10:00 AM on June 5th, the puppet township offices of Zhendong and Yuyi townships in Tuotun, Changyuan, coordinated with a portion of the 380th Regiment of the Chiang Kai-shek's 47th Division, a total of 300 men, to loot wheat in Xizhanggongzhai, Eighth District. Three militiamen and two soldiers from the Eighth District team immediately dispersed, waiting for the enemy to enter the ambush circle. Gunfire erupted from all sides. Before the enemy could return fire, they immediately fled in panic. We won a complete victory, crushing the enemy's grain-grabbing plan.

　　长垣民兵护麦
    五人击退敌伪三百
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】我长垣八区民兵保卫麦收，创造了五人击溃敌人三百的光辉战例。六月五日上午十时，长垣脱屯振东乡、俞义乡两个伪乡公所，配合蒋军四十七师三八○团一部三百人到八区西张弓寨抢麦时，有民兵三人、八区队战士二人，马上散开，待敌进入埋伏圈内，四面枪声齐发，敌未及还枪，立即张惶逃窜，我获全胜，粉碎了敌人抢粮计划。
