　　Heavy Rainfall in Various Parts of the Taiyue Region
    Masses Vigorously Rush to Replenish and Replant
    Qiuxian County, Southern Hebei, Launches a Self-Salvation Replanting Campaign
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] From the 8th to the 10th, widespread rainfall occurred in various parts of our region. The rainfall was less along the Baijin line in northern Yue, including Qinxian, Tunliu, and Changzi counties, and along the Tongpu line, including Pingyao and Jiexiu counties, about three inches. The rest of Qinshui, Anze, Lingshi, Huoxian, and Zhaocheng all received thorough rainfall. Widespread rainfall also occurred in various counties of the second and third districts of southern Shanxi; Qinshui, Yicheng, and other counties have had thorough rainfall, while the rainfall in various counties of the fourth district was less. Currently, the masses in various counties are taking advantage of the moisture to replenish planting and rush to plant late autumn crops. Zhongzhai Village in Yangcheng organized all semi-laborers immediately after the weather cleared on the 10th, working together in the fields. In three days, they replenished 1,273.4 mu of millet and 978.7 mu of late-season corn, and rushed to plant 303 mu of sesame, etc.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 16th dispatch] Yangcheng Fourth District is inspecting drought prevention and preparedness, and launching a "four-rush" movement: rushing to plant, rush to replenish seedlings, rush to harvest, and rush to hoe. The Fourth District convened a meeting of over a hundred village cadres on the 8th of this month. According to statistics from Qi Village, 21,507 jin of wild vegetables have been collected, with Baijian Village collecting the most, a total of 4,992 jin. All places with water sources are actively digging wells. For example, Su Village has dug three wells, Fuze three, Baijian nine, Fosa one, and Taidi one. In addition, Xu Su Village is planning to use the wells at the bottom of coal kilns for irrigation, and one well in Baijian Village has been successfully tested and can irrigate over 60 mu of land. On the third day of the meeting, there was a four-finger rain, and the district head called for rushing to plant, rush to replenish seedlings, rush to harvest wheat, and rush to hoe seedlings. Village cadres returned to their villages overnight to deploy this work.
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 16th dispatch] Responding to the call to "increase grain production to prevent famine," county-level agencies and schools in Julu County have launched a land reclamation competition. County Head Si led correspondents in opening up half a mu of wasteland in Nandasi and planting a hundred or so North China squashes. Students of the First Complete Primary School, under the leadership of their teachers, planted ten mu of black beans along the wasteland of the surrounding walls. Comrade Jiang, Secretary of the Third District Sub-Committee of Qinghe, personally took a hoe to open up wasteland, influencing Wang Guanzhuang Complete Primary School to launch a production and thrift movement, opening up 6.2 mu of wasteland in one afternoon and turning it into ridges. The next morning, they planted cowpeas, North China squashes, eggplants, etc. Subsequently, the entire village launched a land reclamation movement. One hundred and twenty-eight women reclaimed 15.8 mu of land in one day. The agricultural association groups challenged each other, turning 62 mu of wasteland into fertile land in two days.
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 16th dispatch] The masses of Qiuxian County, with the assistance of government agencies and schools, continued to rush to plant, opening up a total of 1,058 mu of wasteland and rushing to sow and plant 59,579 mu of cotton, peanuts, millet, sorghum, melons, and vegetables. The characteristic of the movement was that it progressed from rushing to plant cotton to rushing to plant all kinds of miscellaneous grains, melons, and vegetables, spreading from the location of government agencies and nearby villages to the vast rural areas. Experience has proved that only by opening up the minds of the masses can a wave of rushing to plant be created. Qiuzhi, Qiuxian, because they are located on the sides of the Guantao-Qiu and Qiu-Qu (Zhou) roads, were severely ravaged by the Japanese invaders. In the great famine of 1932, the famine in these two counties was particularly severe. Therefore, after letting the masses recall this, a vigorous mutual rushing-to-plant self-salvation movement was launched. Almost all villages organized temporary mutual assistance, and villages established "shock planting committees" or "headquarters." Fourteen villages in the Fourth District of Qizhi organized ninety-four mutual aid groups, rushing to plant 1,385 mu in four days.

　　太岳各地普遍降雨
    群众全力抢补抢种
    冀南邱县开展抢种自救运动
    【本报太岳十六日电】本区各地于八日至十日普遍降雨。岳北白晋沿线的沁县、屯留、长子，及同蒲线的平遥、介休雨量较小约三寸左右；其余沁源、安泽、灵石、霍县、赵城均落透雨。晋南二、三分区各县亦普遍降雨；沁水、翼城等县已下透雨，四分区各县雨量较小。目前各县群众都在趁湿补种，抢种回茬晚秋，阳城中寨村在十日天晴后，即组织全体半劳力，齐下地齐动手，三天中补种谷子一千二百七十三亩四分，回茬晚玉茭九百七十八亩七分，抢种芝麻等三百零三亩。
    【本报太岳十六日电】阳城四区检查防旱备荒，开展抢种抢补抢割抢锄的四抢运动。四区于本月八日召开村干部百余人会议，据统七村的统计，已采集野菜二万一千五百零七斤，其中采集最多者为白涧村，共采四千九百九十二斤。凡有水源的地方都积极掏井，如苏村已掏井三眼，府泽三眼，白涧九眼，佛沙一眼，台底一眼，此外许夙村正在计划利用煤窑底井灌地，白涧村已有一孔试验成功，可灌地六十余亩。会议第三天适下了四指雨，区长便号召抢种、抢补苗、抢收麦子、抢锄苗，村干部们都星夜返村布置此一工作。
    【本报冀南十六日电】响应“增产粮食防备灾荒”的号召，巨鹿县级机关、学校掀起开荒竞赛，司县长带领通讯员在南大寺开了半亩荒地，种上百十棵北瓜，一完校学生在此教员领导下，沿着围墙废地点黑豆十亩，清河三区分委书记蒋同志亲自拿着＠头开荒，影响得王官庄完小掀起生产节约运动，一晌工夫开荒六亩二分，并打成畦子，次日晨即种上豆角、北瓜、茄子等，此后全村掀起开荒运动，妇女一百二十八人一天开好十五亩八分，农会中组与组互相挑战，两天使六十二亩荒地变为良田。
    【本报冀南十六日电】邱县群众在机关、学校协助下继续抢种，共开荒一千零五十八亩，抢耩、抢点棉花、花生、谷子、高粱、瓜、菜五万九千五百七十九亩。运动的特点由抢点棉花进而抢点一切杂粮、瓜、菜，由机关驻地及附近片村，蔓延到广大农村。经验证明，只有打通群众思想，才会造成抢种浪潮。企之、邱县、因处馆（陶）邱、邱曲（周）路两侧，被日寇摧残厉害，三十二年大灾荒中，该两县灾荒特别严重，所以让群众作了回忆以后，即掀起轰轰烈烈的互相抢种自救运动。各村群众差不多都组织了临时互助，村建立了“突击抢种委员会”或“指挥部”，企之四区十四个村组织了九十四个互助组，四天即抢种一千三百八十五亩。
