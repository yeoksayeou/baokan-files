　　In Taiyuan, Four Grains of Wheat per Yuan
    In Shanghai, a Cake Costs One Thousand Yuan

    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to Tianjin newspapers: In Yan Xishan's old nest, Taiyuan, recently one yuan of Kuomintang currency can only buy four grains of wheat. Yan Xishan convened economic and financial meetings to discuss ways to stabilize prices, but to no avail. In the end, he decided to forcibly requisition grain from the citizens, vainly attempting to escape the food shortage crisis.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd] According to people recently arriving from Shanghai: The price of rice there has risen to 500,000 yuan of Kuomintang currency per dan (approximately 50 kg), and a cake also sells for 1,000 yuan. In cities along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, such as Wuxi, many grain shops and rice stores are closed, refusing to sell. Starving people are抢米 (qiang mi: not readily translated, but implies desperate action such as rushing or even looting for rice) and the market is in turmoil. More people are starving to death in Shanghai. When they arrived in Dongkan Town, Funing East County, in the Liberated Area, they were amazed to find that a sesame cake cost only 25 yuan in Huazhong currency, regarding it as a miracle.

　　太原小麦每元四粒
    上海大饼千元一个
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据天津报载：阎锡山的老窠太原最近粮食每元蒋币已只能购到小麦四粒。阎锡山为此曾召集经济金融会议讨论稳定物价办法，毫无结果。最后决定强迫征购市民粮食，妄想逃避粮荒危机。
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】近据上海来人谈：该地米价每担已涨至蒋币五十万元，大饼亦售至千元一个。京沪线无锡等城市粮栈、米店多闭门拒售，饥民抢米，市面骚动。上海饿死者益众。彼等行抵解放区阜（宁）东县东坎镇，见烧饼仅华中币二十五元一个，均惊异不止，视为奇迹。
