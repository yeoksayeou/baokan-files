Socialism is Consolidated and Strong: The Soviet Union Abolishes the Death Penalty

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. According to TASS: Vishinsky recently published an article titled "A Decree of Historical Significance" on the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union abolishing the death penalty. The article stated: In order to defend the achievements of socialism, to deal with the despicable and barbaric enemies at home and abroad, and to combat serious crimes that threaten the Soviet regime and the Soviet system, the Soviet Union and its member republics have stipulated shooting as an exceptional means in addition to the maximum penalty. This fact alone proves that Soviet legislation is different from that of the vast majority of countries (including Britain and the United States), which never regards the death penalty as an ordinary means of punishment within the scope of general criminal punishment, but as an exception necessitated by special circumstances. Comrade Stalin once pointed out: "The war (referring to the war against Germany) proved the glorious organization and unprecedented consolidation of the Soviet rear." He also emphasized in his speech to voters in 1946: "The Soviet social system is a better form of social organization than any non-Soviet social system." The decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet abolishing the death penalty is a new proof of the superiority of this system. Although some crazy members of the U.S. Congress, such as Thomas, Russell, and Hilluster, and their ilk have made provocative speeches inciting anti-Soviet war, these attempts are doomed to failure. The Soviet Union is resolutely fighting for the cause of democracy and the consolidation of universal peace and the security of all countries, and this peaceful policy is widely supported by the people of all countries. The Soviet Union has abolished the death penalty in peacetime, and the Soviet people welcome this great decree of socialist humanitarianism with deep satisfaction. This decree is proof of the unprecedented faith of all Soviet people in their motherland and the Soviet government, and they are advancing firmly towards new victories under the leadership of their great leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. TASS Moscow: May 28th was the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet state prosecutor's office. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded medals to outstanding workers in the procuratorial organs. Pravda published an editorial stating: During the 25 years of its existence, the procuratorial organs have completed important work for the benefit of the government and the people, exposing the conspiracies of the enemies of the Soviet people at home and abroad. It has carried out and is still carrying out the struggle against various criminals who infringe upon public property and the property of Soviet citizens. The Soviet people hope that the workers of the procuratorial organs will take the interests of the state and the working people as their criteria and continue to vigilantly defend socialist law. Soviet Prosecutor General Gorshecha told a TASS reporter: The leaders of the Soviet people—Lenin and Stalin—often regarded law as an indispensable part of culture. They did not regard law as merely a tool of suppression, but as a cultural force with great educational significance. Soviet law is merciless to the enemies of the people and the country, but it is full of true humanitarianism and deep concern for the Soviet people.

### 废除死刑证明苏联空前强大战争挑拨者的企图必然失败

　　废除死刑证明苏联空前强大战争挑拨者的企图必然失败
    【新华社陕北三日电】据塔斯社讯：维辛斯基顷就苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布废除死刑的法令一事，以“具有历史意义的法令”为题，发表论文略称：为了保卫社会主义的成果，为了对付国内外卑鄙野蛮的敌人，为了与威胁苏维埃政权与苏维埃制度的严重罪行作斗争，苏联及各加盟共和国曾把枪毙规定为最高刑罚以外的例外手段。仅这一事实即可证明苏联立法与绝大多数国家（其中包括英、美）不同，它从不把死刑看作一般刑事惩处范围内的普通的处罚手段，而是看作因特殊环境之必要所产生的例外现象。斯大林同志曾指出：“战争（指对德战争）证明了苏联后方光辉的组织性和史无前例的巩固。”他在一九四六年对选民演讲时也着重指出：“苏维埃社会制度较任何非苏维埃社会制度是更好的社会组织形式。”现在最高苏维埃主席团废除死刑的法令，就是这一制度之优越的新证明。尽管美国某些疯狂的议员如汤姆斯、鲁塞尔、希鲁斯特尔等及其同类发表煽动反苏战争的挑拨性的演说，但这些企图是注定了必然要失败的。苏维埃正为民主事业及普遍和平和各国安全的巩固而进行坚决的斗争，这一和平政策得到各国人民大众的广泛支持。苏联在和平时期废除了死刑，苏维埃人民以深切的满意欢迎这一社会主义之人道主义的伟大法令。这一法令就是全体苏维埃人民对祖国和苏维埃政府空前信仰的证明，他们正在伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的领导下，向新的胜利坚定地前进着。
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯；五月二十八日为苏联国家检察机关建立的二十五周年纪念日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团对检察机关中卓越的工作者颁授勋章。真理报著社论称：检察机关在其存在的二十五年内，已经为政府和人民的利益完成重大的工作，揭发了苏联人民国内外敌人的阴谋，它进行了现在仍在进行着与侵害公共财产及苏联公民财产的各种犯罪分子的斗争。苏联人民希望检察机关的工作者以国家和劳动人民的利益为准则，继续警觉地保卫社会主义法律。苏联总检察官戈尔雪察告塔斯社记者称：苏联人民领袖——列宁和斯大林——常常把法律当做文化的必不可少的部分，他们并不把法律当做仅是压制的工具，而是把法律当作有极大教育意义的文化力量。苏联法律对人民和国家的敌人是无情的，但是对苏联人民却充满了真正的人道主义和深切的关怀。
