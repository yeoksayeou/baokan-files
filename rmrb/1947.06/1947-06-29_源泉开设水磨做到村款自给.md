　　Yuanquan Opens Water Mill, Achieves Village Funding Self-Sufficiency
    [This newspaper's Licheng report] Since the school and village expenses were unified and managed by the village last year, Yuanquan Village has consciously and systematically rectified the village's finances. First, it auctioned off village-owned property such as trees for 30,000 yuan, actively investing in cooperative production. It opened a water mill, earning over 100,000 yuan in half a year. In addition to solving the school's and village's public expenses, it also subsidized the construction of militia ammunition. Currently, there is a remaining profit of 60,000 yuan, which continues to generate interest. Although the accounts have not been settled for this year, based on the business situation in the first half of the year, it is even stronger than last year. Therefore, solving the village's expenses this year is not a problem at all. (Shao Yuan)

　　源泉开设水磨做到村款自给
    【本报黎城讯】自去年学校与村经费归村统筹统支以后，源泉村即对村财政有意识有组织的加以整顿，首先把村公产树等拍卖了洋三万元积极投入合作社生产，开设了水磨一座半年获利十余万元，除解决学校村公费开支外，还补助了民兵弹药的建设，现尚存红利六万元继续生息。今年虽未结帐，但根据前半年营业情况较去年还强，所以该村今年村费解决是毫不成问题的。（绍瑗）
