　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the success of Wallace's nationwide speaking tour has deeply concerned political figures throughout the United States, who are considering the possibility of him forming a third party. This has caused panic among American reactionaries, who are obstructing and sabotaging him. Former Interior Secretary Ickes, Doris Fleeson, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance (N.A.N.U.) news agency, Drummond, a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor, and Evans, a columnist for the Baltimore Sun, have all praised the success of Wallace's speeches. In many large cities, audiences are vying to attend his lectures even if they have to pay admission. Many Democratic civil servants have jointly congratulated Wallace. Some observers believe that Wallace's success is proof of the American people's growing dissatisfaction with Truman's policies. The *Political Observer* reported that the gains from Wallace's speaking tour are not only a success for Wallace himself, but also a demonstration against the Democratic and Republican leadership, and an encouragement to the "New Deal" elements within the Democratic Party. Several signs indicate that Wallace has the support of middle and lower-level leaders within the Democratic Party. Prominent Democratic Senator Pepper also agrees with Wallace's demand that the Democratic Party should adopt liberal policies. In recent speeches, Wallace has repeatedly declared that if the Democratic Party becomes a party of warlords and reactionaries, he will not support it. Wallace also said, "If we cannot make the Democratic Party a liberal party, we should take appropriate actions." These words are generally interpreted as Wallace wanting to form a third party. All of these situations have caused panic among the reactionaries, who are trying to obstruct and sabotage Wallace's speeches. Republican Congressman Meyer of Kansas even openly called on the Attorney General to prosecute Wallace for "treason" in a speech in the House of Representatives.

　　美国人民对杜鲁门日益不满
    华莱士的演说得到广泛欢迎
    【新华社陕北廿日电】综合消息：华莱士旅行全国演讲的成功，已引起全美政界人士深切注意，并考虑到他组织第三党的可能性；因此引起了美国反动派的震恐而予以阻碍及破坏。前内长伊克斯，北美报纸联盟（Ｎ·Ａ．Ｎ．Ｕ．）通讯社记者多瑞斯·福利生，基督教科学箴言言报记者德拉蒙，巴尔的摩太阳报专栏作家依文思等均赞扬华氏演讲的成功。在很多大城市里，听众们即使付出入场费也争着去听讲，许多民主党的公务员联合向华氏祝贺。若干观察家认为，华氏的成功就是美国人民对杜鲁门政策日益不满的证明。《政治观察家》报导称：华氏旅行演讲的收获，不仅是华氏本人的成功，也是一种反对民主党与共和党领导机关的示威，并且鼓舞了民主党内罗斯福“新政”分子。若干迹象显示，华莱士得到民主党内中下层领袖们的支持。著名的民主党参议员泼贝尔亦赞同华氏要求民主党应采取自由主义政策之主张。华氏在最近的演说中一再宣称：假如民主党变成了军阀反动派的政党，他就不支持它。华氏并曾说到：“如果我们不能使民主党成为自由主义的政党，我们就当采取应该采取的适当举动。”这些话，一般的都被人解释为华氏要组织第三党。所有这些情形引起了反动派的震恐，而极谋予华氏讲演以阻碍破坏。堪萨斯州共和党议员梅耶，甚至在众院演说中，公开要总检查官以“叛逆罪”检举华莱士。
