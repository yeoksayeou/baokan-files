　　Do Not Be Deceived by the French Side's "Ceasefire Conditions"
    Ho Chi Minh Calls on the Vietnamese People to Fight with Greater Courage
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th] According to Agence France-Presse: Vietnam previously suggested a ceasefire to France. The French representative then proposed conditions for accepting this suggestion, demanding that Vietnamese troops lay down their arms before any peace talks could begin. Vietnamese President Ho Chi Minh issued a statement opposing these conditions. He declared: "In order to eliminate the invaders, I call on the Vietnamese people to fight with greater courage. Every citizen must become a soldier, every village must become a fortress, and victory will surely be ours!" Ho Chi Minh also issued an appeal to the French people, saying: "These conditions that force us to accept make any rapprochement impossible. People of France, help us save the lives of many young French and Vietnamese people! Long live democratic France! Long live independent and unified Vietnam!"
    [Another Dispatch] The Vietnamese people are indignant that the French side has not accepted Ho Chi Minh's ceasefire proposal. They stated: The entire Viet Minh will unanimously support Ho Chi Minh and is determined to achieve victory in the near future!

    【新华社陕北三十日电】据法国新闻社讯：越南前曾向法国建议停战，法方代表乃提出接受该项建议的条件，要求越南军队在任何和谈开始前放下武器。越南政府主席胡志明对此条件特发表声明，表示反对。渠宣称：“为了消灭侵略者，我号召越南人民以更大的勇气进行战斗，每一个公民必须成为一个战士，每一个村庄必须成为一个堡垒，胜利一定是我们的！”胡氏并对法国人民发出呼吁称：“这些强迫我们接受的条件更加使任何的接近都不可能了。法国的人民，帮助我们挽救许多法国和越南青年的生命吧！民主的法兰西万岁！独立统一的越南万岁！”
    【另讯】越南人民对于法方未能接受胡志明之停战建议，咸表愤慨。彼等称：整个越盟将一致支持胡志明，决心于不远之将来获得胜利！
