    [Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, 22nd] On the evening of the 13th, a unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army captured Songlindian Station between Gaobeidian and Zhuozhou, and Nangangwa Station south of Changxindian, and severely damaged the railway between Liangxiang and Doudian. A total of nine railway bridges were destroyed, several miles of tracks were damaged, and more than 5,000 catties of electric wire were seized. More than a dozen enemies were killed or wounded, and more than fifty were captured. The northern section of the Pinghan Railway has been fragmented, and traffic between Baoding and Beijing remains blocked, causing panic among the Chiang Kai-shek puppets along the line.
