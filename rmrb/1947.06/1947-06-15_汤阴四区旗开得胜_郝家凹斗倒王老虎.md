　　Tangyin Fourth District Achieves Initial Victory
    Haojiaao Struggles Against the Tiger King
    [This newspaper, Tangyin News] Haojiaao in the Fourth District is a small village of just over forty households, ruled by the local tyrant Wang Zhang and his brothers for more than ten years. They committed adultery, oppressed, and exploited the villagers, doing whatever they pleased. When liberation came the year before last, Wang Zhang fled to escape punishment. Last autumn, when the reactionaries attacked, he took the opportunity to return to the village and ran rampant, demanding rent and interest every day, pressing for grain and requisitions. Twenty-eight households in the whole village were falsely accused of communicating with the Eighth Route Army and extorted 450,000 yuan. Nineteen innocent people were forced to their deaths, and two households were completely wiped out. The peasants dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out; their hearts were filled with both old and new hatred for Wang Zhang and his brothers.
    The news of the liberation of Tangyin City spread to the village, and the masses excitedly said, "The sky is clear, the day of revenge has finally arrived," "If you don't kill the tiger, the tiger will still hurt people." The former director of the peasant association, Tang Jishan, took the lead. Wang Zhang fled upon hearing the news. The masses said, "We can't vent our anger if we don't catch Wang Zhang." Everyone set out in four directions, traveling more than eighty li in one day, and finally captured Wang Zhang. On June 1st, a joint peasant struggle meeting was held, attended by more than five hundred people from surrounding villages. More than a hundred cases of blood and tears were revealed at the meeting. The masses unanimously shouted, "Pay back debts, pay back lives!" The government immediately responded to the demands of the masses and executed Wang Zhang according to the law. The more than four hundred and sixty mu of land and houses, furniture, and livestock he had extorted from the masses were distributed to the people. The masses in the street restaurants excitedly said, "If it weren't for the life-saving Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, and the good democratic government, where would we have gotten the chance to vent this anger?"
