　　【This Dispatch from our Newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Area, 20th】 As land reform deepens in Kunwu County, over two hundred village women have been participating in political work, accounting for one half of the county. On May 29th, × Village in the Third District held a mass meeting. All villagers, men and women, were mixed and divided into eleven groups to discuss and elect candidates. The women's association director, Lin Jianhua, was elected as deputy village head, and Lou Xiuzhi was elected as deputy militia captain. Additionally, a women's militia of thirty-two people was organized. After Chen Qixiang, the director of the women's association of Aojing Village, was elected village head, she became even more considerate of the difficulties faced by military families. When Li Yushen volunteered for military service, he said, "I have a seventy-year-old grandmother at home who has no one to take care of her." Chen Qixiang replied, "Your grandmother is my grandmother. I will move her to my home and take care of her." She was poor as a child and knew how to farm and work. Now, she gets up early every day to lead women in hoeing the fields and is very active in her work. Currently, women's participation in politics is widespread, accounting for two-thirds in the Third District. An increasing number of women are joining the militia. In Zhongzu and Northeast Groups of the Second District, seventeen villages have a total armed militia of 1,100 people, of whom 500 are women.
