　　Taiyue Peasants Fully Organized
    Spring Planting Completed Amidst Busy Wartime Support
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 7th] The broad masses of emancipated peasants in the Taiyue area have organized themselves in this year's large-scale production campaign, demonstrating three major characteristics: militarization, comprehensiveness, and rationalization. First: It is the close combination of war and production, with fighting at the front and production in the rear proceeding without hindering each other. For example, Yangcheng County organized 2,700 stretcher teams. All young and middle-aged men of service age actively participated in the standing stretcher teams, usually dispersed in various mutual aid groups for production, and supporting the front during wartime. The land of each stretcher team member is entirely the responsibility of the mutual aid group, with labor exchanged between the two. Fushan County, based on the actual situation of manpower and livestock in the county, uniformly formulated labor assignment tickets by the county government, implementing a large-scale labor exchange between production and participation in the war throughout the county. This is a highly developed integration of war and production in the county. At the same time, in the specific labor exchange between participation in the war and production, various places have perfect systems. For example, general assignment tickets are also work tickets, and work tickets can also be exchanged for assignment tickets. To encourage and stimulate the enthusiasm for participating in the war, assignment tickets in various places generally have higher values. For example, in Jiangli Village, Yangcheng, standing stretcher team members and militiamen who set off each day earn 12 work points, while mutual aid group members working at home earn 10 work points per day. In Shangguan, Yanshan, the mutual aid brigade stipulates that when participating in the war, militiamen and civilians who have been on the front line for more than half a month will receive an additional 2 work points per day. Due to the correct resolution of the combination of participation in the war and production, and the sound system, a large number of peasants go to the front line without any family concerns, and production in the rear is still planted on time. For example, in Jinan campaign, Qinshui County had a population of 46,000, and 20,000 laborers supported the front, while production in the rear was still cultivated on time. Second: Comprehensiveness is unprecedented in the entire area. In particular, the participation of semi-able-bodied laborers in agricultural production has been universally organized, replacing the fully able-bodied laborers who support the front. For example, in the joint brigade of Shi Zhenming in Fushan, all women, children, old men, cripples, handicraftsmen, and small merchants were 100% organized. In Jide Village, Yangcheng County, all 447 households in the village, except for 6 households without labor, were all organized, and even workers participated in mutual aid groups to work the land. In Xiye Village, 92% of all male and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village are organized, and 96% of women are organized, so 30% of the labor force is saved, and labor efficiency is generally improved. Third: Rationalization. In production, various places carry out equal value exchange, work according to skills, distribute dividends according to labor, and promote the strengths of one skill. For example, in Jide Village, Yangcheng County, the old ploughing experts specialize in ploughing, and the young and middle-aged carry manure, everyone doing their best and improving labor efficiency. In the Wang Sanguan mutual aid brigade in Longquan Village, Qinyuan, to encourage semi-able-bodied laborers to improve their labor skills, scores are determined according to the size of the labor force, and additional points are added according to the work done. For example, an old man is a semi-able-bodied laborer, earning 5 or 6 work points per day, but when ploughing, he is experienced and earns as much as a full-fledged worker, that is, increased to 10 points. Women's wages are increased or decreased according to the season. For example, women are not good at ploughing and sowing, earning half a day's work, but they earn a full day's work when weeding. The Liu Jinrong mutual aid brigade in Shimin Dongjiashan, because the villages are scattered, mainly does scattered work, so each village has its own wage rate. During the spring planting campaign this year, many laborers went to the front line, and it was necessary to concentrate on doing work, so wages were unified throughout the brigade. In addition, this year, soldiers, cadres, families of martyrs, and retired soldiers have also been universally organized. In addition to participating in production according to their own labor force, those who are insufficient are given preferential treatment by the mutual aid group, which can save a lot of labor. For example, all military families in Zhang Nu Village, Qinshui, were organized, saving one-third of the labor compared to the previous year's simple military support. In Shangguan Joint Brigade, Yangcheng County, due to the rational organization of military and cadre families to participate in production, the masses can also truly treat military families preferentially, and military families are also very satisfied.

　　太岳农民全面组织起来
    战勤繁忙中完成春耕
    【本报太岳七日电】太岳区广大翻身农民在今年大规模生产运动中组织起来，表现出战斗化、全面化、合理化三大特点。第一：是战争与生产密切的结合，前方打仗后方生产两不误。如阳城全县组织两千七百付担架队，凡在服役年龄之青壮年，均奋勇参加常备担架队，平时分散在各个互助组中进行生产，战时支援前线，每个担架队员之土地全由互助组负责，双方变工。浮山县根据全县人力、畜力的实际情况，由县政府统一制订差工票，实行全县生产与参战大变工，此为该县战争、生产两位一体高度的发展。同时在参战与生产的具体变工中，各地均有完善的制度，如一般的差票亦即工票，工票亦可换差票，为鼓励与刺激参战情绪，各地差票一般多顶分，如阳城之匠礼村凡常备担架队员及民兵出发每天顶工十二分，而在家劳动之互助组员一工顶十分。岩山上官中有互助大队规定参战民夫及民兵在前线超过半月后，每日加工二分。由于参战与生产结合的正确解决与健全的制度，所以大批农民毫无家庭顾虑的源源开赴前线，后方的生产仍按时种，如沁水全县四万六千人口，在晋南战役中即有两万劳力支援前线，而后方的生产仍按时耕种。第二：全面化为全区之空前未有，特别是普遍组织了半劳力参加农业生产，代替了支援前线的全劳力，如浮山石振明的联合大队，将所有之妇女、儿童、老汉、跛子及手工业者小商人百分之百的组织起来。阳城吉德村全村四百四十七户，除六户无劳力外，其余全部组织起来，连工人也参加互助组上地。西冶村全村男全半劳力组织起来百分之九十二，妇女组织起来百分之九十六，所以三十省一工，普遍的提高了劳动效率。第三：合理化，各地在生产中自以等价交换，按活计工，按劳分红，发扬一技术之长。如阳城吉德村年老的犁地行家，专门犁地，青壮年担粪，人人各尽所能，提高了劳动效率。沁源龙泉村王三官互助大队，为鼓励半劳力提高劳动技术，是按劳力大小定出分数，再按活加分，如老汉是半劳力，每工顶五分，或六分，但犁地时却有经验，顶个全把式，即增至十分。妇女们则按季节增减工资，如犁地下种时妇女们不行，顶半工，而拔苗锄草时却顶全工。士敏董家山刘金荣互助大队，因村庄分散，多分散做活，所以各庄各有自己的工价，今春突击下种时，不少劳力上了前线，必须集中做活，因此便在全大队中统一工资。此外今年各地军、干、烈属及荣退军人也普遍组织起来，按其本身劳力参加生产外，其不足者才由互助组优待，这样可以节省很多劳力；如沁水张驽村军属全部组织起来，比往年单纯优军省工三分之一。阳城上官中有联合大队由于合理的组织了军、干属参加生产，所以群众亦能真正优待军属，军属也很满意。
