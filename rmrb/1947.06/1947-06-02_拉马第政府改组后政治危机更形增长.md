　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS, Moscow—Pravda observer Viktorov recently commented on the French situation, stating: The reshuffle of the Ramadier government has proven to worsen the internal political situation in France, and a new situation has unfolded in the struggle between democratic and reactionary forces. The fact that the Communist ministers were excluded from the cabinet proves that the government is turning to the right, and the socialists are obediently following the right wing. This fact is due to the Socialist Party's denial of their previous decisions and their change of position. Viktorov continued: When observing the current situation in France, one must pay attention to the influence exerted by external forces. American newspapers, and not just newspapers, frankly declare that the United States will only provide financial assistance to France under very clear conditions; and these conditions have nothing in common with the goal of restoring the French economy on a democratic basis. American monopoly capital is paying close attention to the development of France, hoping to use France's economic difficulties to increase its economic position in France. Under these circumstances, De Gaulle's engagement in political activities is by no means accidental. His activities and the fact that he is organizing a new party with ample financial support are signals to mobilize all reactionary forces. It is at such a critical moment, when the reactionaries believe it is appropriate to launch a resolute offensive, and all democratic forces need to unite, that the Socialist Party has taken the path of splitting and dividing democratic forces. The right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, regardless of the risk of intensifying the struggles within their own party and further weakening their position in the working class, are determined to obstruct cooperation with the Communist Party. Viktorov concluded: A new situation in the struggle between democratic and reactionary forces has arisen. Obviously, the French nation and its many democratic organizations are capable of defending their interests.

　　拉马第政府改组后政治危机更形增长
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家维克多诺夫顷评论法国局势略称：事实证明了，拉马第政府的改组使法国内部的政治情况更形恶化，而在民主力量和反动势力的斗争中则展开了新的局面。将共产党各部长从内阁中排挤出去的这一事实，证明政府正在向右转，社会党人正在顺从的跟着右翼跑。这一事实是因为社会党否认了他们以前的决定并改变了他们的立场。维克多诺夫继称：在观察目前法国局势时，人们必须注意到外部力量所给予的影响。美国报纸，而且不仅是报纸，非常坦白的宣称：只有在一切非常明确的条件下，美国才给法国以财政援助；而这些条件与在民主基础上恢复法国经济的目的是毫无相同之处的。美国的独占资本正在专心的注视着法国的发展，希望利用法国所遭受的经济困难去增加它在法国的经济地位。在这些情况下，戴高乐从事政治活动的事实决不是偶然的。他的活动和他正在组织一个有充分财政供给的新党的事实，就是动员所有反动力量的信号。正是在这样一个关头，反动派认为是宜于转入坚决的进攻，而所有民主力量则正需要团结的时候，社会党却采取了分裂与分化民主力量的道路。社会党的右翼首领们不顾冒着加剧他们自己党内斗争与更加削弱他们在工人阶级中的地位的危险，他们决意要阻挠和共产党合作。维氏结论称：民主力量与反动力量间斗争的新局面已经随之而起。显然的，法兰西民族和她的许多民主组织是能够保卫他们的利益的。
