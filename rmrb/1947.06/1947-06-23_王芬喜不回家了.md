　　Wang Fenxi Doesn't Want to Go Home
    Zhao Ziyue
    Wang Fenxi was captured by Sun Dianying's troops last September to work as a cook. He was liberated under Tangyin City and lived in the fifth squad of the reception center to study. He is a simple and honest farmer. When he looks at people, his eyes are always staring straight ahead, as if he has something to say, but he can't get it out...

    Zhang Wenwei slept next to Wang Fenxi, with only one person in between. The night before, Zhang Wenwei had been showing off his 620 yuan, but the next morning, before the morning exercise, it was gone. He immediately reported it to Feng Yinkai, the temporary squad leader recently elected by everyone. Squad Leader Feng was an old soldier under Sun Dianying. After this education on the leniency policy, he was also very moved. When he learned of this incident, he said angrily to everyone, "This matter must be clarified immediately. Don't let the team know about it yet. It's too embarrassing!"

    The entire fifth squad was assembled, and everyone was checked. Apart from five or six people who were found to have some money, 720 yuan was also found on Wang Fenxi. Although the amounts of money were not right, everyone thought Wang Fenxi was very suspicious. Because he was wearing a tattered padded jacket, which looked very distinctive, and the money was taken from the corner of his lapel, they thought it was even more suspicious. Squad Leader Feng stared at him hatefully and asked:

    "Say, where did you get so much money?"

    "The unit exchanged 750 yuan for me. I spent 30 before coming to the fifth squad, so there's still 720..."

    "Stop pretending." Before Wang Fenxi could finish speaking, Squad Leader Feng got angry, "Why did you hide the money in your lapel? ... Tell the truth, I think you're up to no good!"

    "No... I didn't do it on purpose, look." Wang Fenxi trembled and opened his tattered pocket, "The bottom of this pocket is torn, and the money fell into my lapel..."

    "Don't talk nonsense, tell the truth," the squad leader ignored his explanation.

    All the squads in the company had finished their lessons, some were playing chess, and some were chatting, but the fifth squad had no rest. More than a dozen people surrounded Wang Fenxi in the room again, questioning him one after another. Wang Fenxi was covered in sweat, and he thought to himself, the Eighth Route Army liberated me, and I finally escaped from Sun Lao Dian to save my life, but I didn't expect this to happen. Alas! As long as I have my life, I'm used to being wronged about money. Finally, he hardened his heart:

    "Don't make things difficult for me. I'm willing to cover the 620 yuan, but in good conscience, I didn't steal anyone's money."

    Wang Fenxi didn't expect that this offer would make things worse. Everyone said that if Wang Fenxi hadn't stolen the money, how could he be willing to take out more than 600 yuan to compensate? He was a thief who didn't want to be known as a thief!... The whole room became more and more chaotic, and Wang Fenxi was too overwhelmed to cope.

    The matter escalated to the point where Squad Leader Feng slapped Wang Fenxi four times. This beating brought Wang Fenxi's old thinking back. He remembered how he had lived in the KMT-controlled areas for the past few years. He had suffered all kinds of persecution from the village chiefs and officials. If he encountered this situation, regardless of the ins and outs, it was better to say a few more "yes, yes, yes," which was considered discerning. So when Squad Leader Feng asked him, "Did you steal it?"

    Wang Fenxi said without hesitation:

    "Yes, yes, yes."

    "How did you steal it?"

    "I picked it up in the toilet."

    "Damn you, you're talking nonsense," Squad Leader Feng got angry again, "People lost it in their pockets while sleeping."

    "Yes, yes, I took it out of his pocket."

    Everyone in the room breathed a sigh of relief, and the matter was considered clear. Squad Leader Feng prepared to submit this well-handled case to the battalion headquarters, and before leaving, he told Wang Fenxi, "The Eighth Route Army holds struggle meetings, and we'll see how you fare then!"

    But the news of the fifth squad of the seventh company beating someone immediately spread to the battalion headquarters. Before Squad Leader Feng could leave, Battalion Commander Qian and Company Commander Shi arrived. They first pointed out that the Eighth Route Army had abolished the beating and scolding system, and now that everyone was under the leadership of the Eighth Route Army, they had to follow the rules of the Eighth Route Army...

    Ever since Wang Fenxi was beaten, his ears were ringing particularly loudly, and he felt that his face was very large, burning in waves. He didn't bother to listen to the battalion commander's words. Even when Battalion Commander Qian asked him, he still said, "Yes, yes, yes, I stole it from his pocket."

    However, after Battalion Commander Qian learned about what had happened, he felt that there were still problems. After investigation, Battalion Commander Qian made an analysis: First, checking the financial registration book of the unit's supply section, the amount of money Wang Fenxi had was completely correct. Second, Zhang Wenwei's bills were six 100-yuan notes, with loose change on the outside, while Wang Fenxi had two 200-yuan notes and three 100-yuan notes (with loose change also on the outside). If he had exchanged it with someone else, there was only one night, the sentry was very strict, and it was completely impossible. Third, people who knew him all confirmed that Wang Fenxi was an honest farmer, and the process of admitting to stealing the money was clearly forced.

    After Battalion Commander Qian spoke, everyone felt that it was very true. And the money that Zhang Wenwei lost was also found to have some other clues at this time after investigation. Immediately after, this matter was carried out in the entire meeting of the seventh company for education. Fifth Squad Leader Feng Yinkai admitted his mistake to everyone, saying that he should not have failed to report the matter to the company first, and then arbitrarily beat and scold people. He said, "This is a bad habit brought from Sun Dianying's side, and it must be changed in the future."

    The next day, Wang Fenxi said to Battalion Commander Qian with a smile:

    "I want to join the army, is that okay?"

    "Didn't you sign up to go home!" Battalion Commander Qian asked strangely.

    "No, it's better to join the army."

    "Why?"

    "If I join the Eighth Route Army, I won't be wronged again!" After saying that, he breathed a sigh of relief!

    The battalion headquarters immediately added Wang Fenxi's name to the roster of those joining the army.

### 王芬喜不回家了

　　王芬喜不回家了
    赵子岳
    王芬喜去年九月间，被孙殿英部抓去当了伙夫，在汤阴城下被解放过来，住在收容所五班里学习。他是个纯朴老实的农民，看着人，眼睛老是直瞪瞪，像是有话，又说不出来……
    和王芬喜一块睡觉，中间只隔一个人的是张文尉，张文尉头天晚上还装得好好的六百二十元，第二天清早，不等出早操就不翼而飞了。他马上就报告了才由大家选出来的临时班长冯印凯。冯班长是孙殿英部下的老兵，经过这次宽大政策的教育，也很受感动，他知道了这件事，就气恨地对大家说：“这事情要马上弄清楚，先不必让队部知道，实在太丢人！”
    第五班全体集合了，每人都经过了检查，除五、六个查出一些钱来以外，从王芬喜身上也掏出七百二十元，虽然钱数都不对头，但是都认为王芬喜非常可疑。因为他穿着一件破烂夹便衣，显的很特别，钱呢，又是从衣襟角里掏出来的，他们认为更可疑，冯班长便恨恨地盯住他问：
    “说，你那里这样多的钱”？
    “所部给我兑换的七百五十元，我没有来五班就花了三十，还有七百二……”。
    “装他妈的洋蒜”。没有等王芬喜把话说完，冯班长就动了怒，“为什么把钱藏在衣襟里？……说实话吧，我看你就有鬼”！
    “不……不是故意来，你看”。王芬喜颤抖地翻开他的破口袋，“这是口袋底上破了口，把钱落到衣襟里了……”。
    “别乱扯，说实话，班长就没有理会他的解释”。
    全连各班都上过了课，有的下棋，有的在谈天，可是第五班就没有休息，十几个人又把王芬喜包围在屋子里，一句跟一句地追问着。王芬喜满身出了汗，心里暗暗地想，八路军把我解放了，总算从孙老殿那里逃出来活命，可是想不到出了这事，唉！只要命在，冤枉钱是出惯了的，最后他狠了狠心：
    “你们不要难为我，六百二十元我愿意包了，可是凭良心我没有偷人的钱。”
    王芬喜就没有想到这一包，反把事情弄坏了，大家说，如果王芬喜没有偷人的钱，他怎么肯拿出六百多元给人包赔呢，他是作贼还不愿落个偷的名字！……满屋子越吵越乱了，把王芬喜逼的实在应付不过来。
    事情一直发展到冯班长重重地打了王芬喜四个耳光。这一打，把王芬喜的旧脑筋打回来了，他记起了这几年在蒋占区是怎样过活的。他曾受尽保长和官长的逼迫，如果遇到这种情况，别管七长八短，还是多说几个“是，是，是”，反倒算有眼色的。所以当冯班长问他：“是你偷的不是？”
    王芬喜再不考虑就说：
    “是，是，是”。
    “怎样偷的”，
    “在茅房里拾的”。
    “他妈的你胡说，”冯班长又火起了，“人家是睡下在口袋里丢的”。
    “是，是，我在他口袋里掏出来的。”
    满屋子的人这才松了一口气，事情就算这样弄清楚了。冯班长准备把这件已办妥当的案子，送交大队部，临走还告王芬喜说：“八路军兴开斗争大会，到那时候咱们再见高低！”
    可是七连五班打人的事马上就传到大队部了。还没有等冯班长出门，钱大队长和时连长就赶来了，首先就指出八路军是废止打骂制度的，大家现在是受八路军领导，那么就得按八路军的规矩办事……
    王芬喜自从挨了打，耳朵里响的特别利害，觉得自己的脸不知有多大，一阵一阵地直发烧，队长的话他全没有顾得听，就是钱大队长问他，他也还是“是，是，是，我在他口袋里偷的”。
    然而钱大队长知道了他们的这些经过以后，总觉得其中还有问题。经过调查，钱大队长作了个分析：第一、查过所部保管股的资财登记账，和王芬喜的钱数完全不错。第二、张文尉的票子是一百元的六张，零数在外，而王芬喜却是二百元的两张，一百元的三张（零数也在外），要说他是向别人换了吧？只有一夜时间，岗哨很严，完全没有可能。第三、认识他的人都证实王芬喜是个老实农民，而承认偷钱的过程显然出于强迫。
    经钱大队长谈话以后，大家都觉的很对。而张文尉丢的钱，经过追究，这时也另外查出了些线索。紧接着就把这件事就在七连的全体会上进行了教育。五班长冯印凯向大家承认了错误，不该有事不先报告连部，又随便打骂人，他说：“这是从孙殿英那里带来的坏习气，以后一定要改掉。”
    次日，王芬喜笑嘻嘻地向钱大队长说：
    “我想参军，行不行”？
    “你不是报名要回家吗”！钱大队长奇怪地问。
    “不，还是参军好”。
    “为什么”？
    “参加了八路军，我再不会受冤枉气了”！说罢他痛痛快快地呼了一口气！
    大队部随即把王芬喜的名字，又填到参军的花名册上。
