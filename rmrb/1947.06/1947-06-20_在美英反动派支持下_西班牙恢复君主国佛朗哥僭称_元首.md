　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. Backed by American and British reactionaries, the fascist remnant, Spanish dictator Franco, inheriting the mantle of his ancestor Hitler, has usurped the title of Spanish "Head of State". According to a Reuters dispatch from Madrid: The Spanish Parliament passed the Law of Succession on the evening of the 7th of this month, stipulating that Spain is a monarchical country and that Franco is its head of state. Supporters of Juan (note: Juan is a prince of the former Spanish royal family) in Madrid issued a statement on the same evening, refusing to recognize this new decree.

    西班牙恢复君主国佛朗哥僭称“元首”
    【新华社陕北十三日电】法西斯余孽西班牙独裁者佛朗哥，在美英反动派支持下，继承其老祖希特勒衣钵、僭称西班牙“元首”。据路透社马德里讯：西班牙国会于本月七日晚通过继承法，规定西班牙为一君主国家，并以佛朗哥为其元首。马德里拥护胡昂（按：胡昂为西班牙前王室亲王）之人士，于同日晚发表声明，不承认此项新法令。
