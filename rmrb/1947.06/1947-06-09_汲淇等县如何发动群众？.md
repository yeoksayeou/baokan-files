How did Ji, Qi and other counties mobilize the masses?
    Xiao Quan, Ju Xiang
    The mass movement in the newly recovered areas of Ji, Qi, and Tangyin counties is underway. The preliminary experience is introduced below for reference:
    (1) Expose the conspiracies of landlords and stabilize the emotions of the masses.
    According to information from Xinxiang, Ji, Qi, and Tangyin counties, when the enemy retreated this time, special agents spread rumors extensively to confuse the masses, causing a large number of them to flee. According to investigations of the fleeing households in Anyang, Shuiye, and Guantai, the main reasons for the masses fleeing were: the enemy's rumors, deception, and threats: 1. For example, to the basic masses they would say: "If you don't retreat, people won't let you when they come back." 2. To the landlords they would say, "This time the struggle will be even fiercer, not to mention counter-reckoning." 3. To the lower-level puppet organization personnel: "You have worked for the Kuomintang army, the Eighth Route Army will not let you go." 4. To the general public: "The policy of the Eighth Route Army has changed, they will have men, women, old and young lying on landmines." In Shuiye and Guantai, landlords and special agents convened youth meetings, saying, "No one is allowed not to leave, whoever doesn't leave and works for the Eighth Route Army, we will kill you when we come back." Secondly, some people fled blindly. Therefore, in the beginning, we must stabilize the situation. The methods are: 1. Carry out mass propaganda, expose the enemy's deception and conspiracies, publicize our policies, and stabilize the people's hearts. 2. Pay attention to mass discipline and shatter enemy rumors with facts. This time, after the militia and stretcher bearers participating in the war carried out the "Love the People" movement, the new district masses were greatly influenced. 3. Point out the direction of struggle and methods of struggle to the masses, and help them to carry it out. In terms of methods, hold symposiums for intellectuals, training classes, small meetings, mass meetings, etc.
    At the same time, we must recognize the conspiracies of the landlords and mobilize the masses to rise up and struggle. The landlords' conspiracies are as follows: 1. In addition to running away, those who have not run away hide themselves. When the landlords run away, they disperse their property to relatives or basic mass families. They threaten the masses that they must hide it, and say that if it is taken away by the Eighth Route Army, they will be responsible. Because the masses are afraid of changes and afraid that we will know that they have hidden the landlord's things, they dare not reveal their property and dare not participate in meetings. 2. Implement false struggles, distributing some land, contracts, and grain to the masses. 3. Go out during the day and return at night, on the one hand, entrust the 保长 (baozhang) to deal with us, saying that the landlord is not there and does not know where the grain is stored, in order to resist our grain requisition. 4. Conceal the stubborn village public office armed forces.
    (2) Train poor peasants and hired laborers in large numbers to meet the needs of the masses.
    Although the masses in the new district suspected us under the deception of the enemy, once propaganda and explanation are given, they will actively rise up to struggle. They urgently need grain and land, especially wheat fields. At that time, wheat was about to be harvested, and who would harvest it was the most concerned issue for the masses. Therefore, we should seize the needs of the masses and distribute the land and property of fleeing traitors, despots, and landlords to the masses, and the masses will act. The masses in Shangxia Gaoying said: "As long as we don't go hungry, we dare to give opinions and struggle." The masses in Zaozhuang initially did not dare to demolish the blockhouses, but after mobilizing the masses to recognize jujube trees, they quickly demolished the blockhouses. In Dongfangdian, the property of the head of the puppet security regiment was confiscated to help twenty households of the masses, and the masses dared to take it.
    Training poor peasants and hired laborers has played a significant role. Ji County has trained 700 people in two sessions, and Tangyin Fifth District has trained 650 people in two sessions. Most are poor peasants, hired laborers, who have fled famine and begged for food. The training starts with studying current affairs, talking about the past to inspire them to oppose traitors, seek revenge, and pour out grievances, to increase the courage of the masses to struggle. After the poor peasants and hired laborers in Tangyin Fifth District studied current affairs, they were asked to think about how they had spent the past two years, and everyone told of the suffering of exploitation and oppression by the landlords. Then the land policy was explained, and the county magistrate also spoke to support everyone and make decisions for them. Finally, they swore an oath to establish a farmers' association and decided to overthrow the 保长 (baozhang) in the first step and replace it with the farmers' association. And set up a joint emancipation committee in each base point, selecting three representatives from each village, in order to take joint action. This encouraged their courage to struggle.

　　汲淇等县如何发动群众？
    效泉　菊香
    汲、淇、汤阴三县新收复区群运正在开展，现将其初步经验介绍如下以供参考：
    （一）揭露地主阴谋，稳定群众情绪。
    从新辉、汲、淇、汤阴几个县了解，这次敌人败退时，特务大肆造谣，迷惑群众，造成群众大批逃亡。据安阳、水冶、观台对逃亡户的追究。群众逃亡的主要原因是：敌人造谣欺骗与威胁：一、如对基本群众说：“你们没退出去，人家回来不行你。”二、对地主则说“这次回来斗的更厉害，反倒算更不用说”。三、对下层伪组织人员：“你给国军做过事，八路军来了不得了”。四、对一般人说：“八路军政策变了，叫男女老少躺地雷”。水冶、观台地主、特务则召集青年开会，“谁都不准不走，谁不走，给八路军办事，我们回来杀了你们头。”其次有一部分人是盲目跑的。因此开始我们必须稳定局面，办法是：１、开展群众性的宣传，揭破敌人欺骗与阴谋。宣传我们政策，稳定人心，２、注意群众纪律，用事实粉碎敌人谣言，这次参战民兵、担架开展民爱民运动后，新区群众影响很好。３、给群众指出斗争方向及斗争方法，并帮助其进行。方式上开知识分子座谈会，训练班，小型会议，群众大会等。
    同时必须认识地主之阴谋，发动群众起来斗争。地主阴谋有如下几种：１、除逃跑外，未逃跑者，则隐蔽起来，地主逃跑时将财产分散到亲戚或基本群众家。他们威胁群众非放不行，并说如果被八路军弄走要负责，因群众怕变天，怕我们知他藏有地主东西，不敢露财产，不敢参加会，２、实行假斗争，将部分土地、文约及粮食分给群众。３、昼出夜回，一面托保长应付我们，说地主不在，不知粮食放何处，以抗我征粮。４、把顽乡公所武装隐蔽起来。
    （二）大批训练贫雇，满足群众要求。
    新区群众虽然在敌人欺骗下对我怀疑，但一经宣传解释，便会积极起来斗争。他们迫切要粮食、土地，尤其是麦地，当时麦子就要收割，归谁收割就是群众最关心的一个问题，因此应抓紧群众要求，将逃亡之汉奸、恶霸、地主土地财产分给群众，群众就会行动起来，上下高营群众说：“只要饿不着肚子，就敢提意见斗争”。枣庄群众初不敢拆炮楼，后发动群众认枣树，很快就把炮楼拆掉了。东方店，没收了伪保安团长财产救济了二十户群众，群众都敢要。
    训练贫雇起了很大作用，汲县二次训练七百人，汤阴五区二次训练六百五十人。大部是贫雇、羊工，逃过荒、要过饭。训练是从学习时事开始，谈时光中启发他们反奸、复仇、诉苦，提高群众斗争勇气。汤阴五区训练贫雇学习时事后，提出想想咱们这两年怎样过时光，由是每个人都说出了地主剥削、压迫之苦。接着讲了土地政策，县长也讲了话，给大家撑腰作主，最后宣誓成立农会，决定第一步回去推翻保长，以农会代替。并以基点成立联合翻身委员会，每村选代表三人，以便联合行动，这样鼓动了他们斗争勇气。
