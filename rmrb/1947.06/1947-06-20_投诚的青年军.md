Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi Frontline, 15th: Just the day after a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army approached the outskirts of Yan'an City, three student-like Youth Army soldiers surrendered from Yan'an City. They were originally from Chiang Kai-shek's "SS" National Defense Ministry Youth Army. In early April, Hu Zongnan incorporated them into the so-called "People's Service Corps" and transferred them from Xi'an to Yan'an, preparing them to be township chiefs. They were from the Fifth Battalion. One of them, named Zhang Sanbao, previously belonged to the 206th Division of the Youth Army. I asked him, "How do you serve the people?" "I don't know how to serve," he said with a wry smile, weakly, "The superiors only said to come to Yan'an to be chiefs and township heads, but they never told us how to serve." Another one named Feng Yuqing continued, "They did tell us, they repeatedly reminded us that the people in the border area are all old communists and not easy to deal with. You must use a firm and unwavering will to serve, and you must be prepared to endure hardship for five years," and so on.

"So what do you think?"

"We," Feng Yuqing took off his American "pancake" hat, spun it on his index finger, and said in a rebellious tone, "No! Not even for five months. We are the Youth Army, we originally joined the army to resist Japan, not to fight a civil war. We should have been demobilized and gone home long ago!"

They said that their battalion had been transferred to Yan'an for a month, but they were still waiting for a vaguely defined "appointment." According to the plan, the 15th Company was to be assigned to Ansai, the 16th Company to Yanchang, and the 17th Company to Yanchuan. However, Yanchang and Yanchuan were deemed to be in "poor condition." The 15th Company was originally on standby in Hezhuangping (ten miles northwest of Yan'an City), ready to take office as soon as Ansai was occupied. Who knew that on the 10th of last month, the People's Liberation Army attacked Hezhuangping with a small number of troops at night. The 15th Company was terrified and fled back to Yan'an City overnight. As a result, the members were even less willing to stay in this sesame-sized position, and even more eager to return home. The number of deserters was increasing day by day. When the county was captured by the People's Liberation Army, they cried and ran to tell each other, "Our retreat has been cut off. We can't be officials, and we can't go home. What should we do?"

So the three of them surrendered to the People's Liberation Army.

As for the few "sesame officials" who had already taken office, their "service" achievements were also very pathetic. The daily routine of the chiefs and township heads in Yan'an was to gather the few "good citizens" in the South Gate Square in the morning and lazily drag them around for a few laps. Hu Zongnan originally wanted to rely on this group of educated youths to do some political work and "conquer" the people of Yan'an ideologically, but the people of Yan'an answered with silence. Apart from running, this hope was dashed.

One routine was to personally teach the children to sing "anti-communist" songs. However, the person teaching had no energy, and the person singing had even less energy, and the phrases cursing the Communist Party were sung very vaguely. The "sesame officials" naturally understood in their hearts, but they could only pretend to be confused and muddle along.

Zhang Sanbao wrinkled his nose and said to me, "Everyone knows in their hearts that Hu Zongnan himself doesn't necessarily have the energy. The so-called 'several five years' is self-deception." He then told me a widely circulated rumor that when Nanjing "congratulated" Hu Zongnan on the "recovery of Yan'an," this "Northwest King" felt guilty. He said to people, "Recovering Yan'an was not a difficult task, but it is impossible to withdraw from Yan'an!" Then, Zhang Sanbao said humorously, "Withdrawing from Yan'an is not a difficult task either, as long as we run to your side like this, don't you think?!"

　　投诚的青年军
    张法
    【新华社陕北前线十五日电】就在解放军某部迫近延安城郊的第二天，有三个学生模样的青年军人，从延安城内投诚过来，他们原是蒋介石的“党卫军”国防部青年军。四月初，胡宗南把他们编为所谓“人民服务总队”，从西安调到延安来，准备作乡保长的。他们是五大队的，有一个名叫张三宝的，过去属于二○六师的青年军，我问他“你们怎样给人民服务”，“我也不知道怎么服务”，他苦笑了一下，无力的说：“上级只说是到延安来当保长乡长的，至于怎样服务，他们一句也未曾交代过。”旁边一个名叫冯玉清的接着说：“交代也交代过，他们再三提醒我们，边区的老百姓个个是老共，不是好惹的，你们要用坚毅不拔的意志来服务，你们要准备吃苦干五年”等等。
    “那么你们觉得怎样呢？”
    “我们”，冯玉清把头上那顶美国“烧饼”帽摘下来，顶在食指上旋转着，用反抗的口气说：“不！五个月也不干，我们是青年军，我们本是为了抗日才从军的，不是为打内战来的，照理早就该复员回家了！”
    他们说他们这一大队调到延安已有一个月，至今却还在等待茫茫无期的“任命”。按照计划，十五中队分配在安塞，十六中队分配在延长，十七中队分配在延川，可是延长、延川因为“情况不佳”，十五中队本来已经在何庄坪（延安城西北十里）待命，一俟占领安塞，就可走马上任。谁知到了上月十日，解放军以极少数部队夜袭何庄坪，十五中队闻风丧胆，连夜窜回延安城内。这样一来，队员们更加无心留恋这个芝麻般的官职，更加归心如箭，开小差的数目正在一天一天的增加着。当县被解放军攻克的时候，他们哭丧着脸，奔走相告：“咱们后路被切断了，既当不了官，又回不得家，怎么办？”
    于是他们三个人，就向解放军投诚了。
    至于少数已经上了任的“芝麻官”，其“服务”的成绩也是很可怜的，延安的保长乡长每天的例行公事，是早晨把寥寥无几的“良民”们集合在南关广场，懒洋洋的拖拖拉拉的跑几个圈子，胡宗南本来很想依靠这批知识青年作些政治工作，从思想上来“征服”延安的人民，可是延安人民用沉默作了回答。除了跑步而外，这个希望落了空。
    一件例行公事是亲自教孩子们唱“反共”歌，不过教的人没有劲，唱的人更没有劲，而且把骂共党的词句，唱得极含糊，“芝麻官”心里自然明白，不过他们也只能装个糊涂，得过且过。
    张三宝皱皱鼻子对我说：“大家心里都有个晓，胡宗南自己也不见得有劲，所谓‘若干五年’的话，是自欺欺人的。”他于是又告诉我一件流行很广的传说，当南京向胡宗南“庆贺”“光复延安”的时候，这位“西北王”心虚了，他对人说：“光复延安本来不是件难事，可是要退出延安却不可能了！”接着，张三宝幽默地说：“要退出延安也不是难事，只要像我们这样跑到你们这边来，你说对不对？！”
