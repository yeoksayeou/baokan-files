Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 7th:
    Taiyuan's grain shortage is severe, and citizens are frequently dying. On May 11th, the reactionary Yan regime implemented a total control of all grain businesses in the city. Except for the military, who could buy and sell freely, ordinary people were not allowed to buy more than five *jin* of grain per person, and it was ordered that citizens without six months' worth of food were not allowed to live in the city. Each "National Soldier" had to pay three *shi* and five *dou* of rice and wheat. Market grain prices soared. From May 15th to the 26th, in ten days, the price of rice rose from 820,000 yuan per *shi* to 900,000 yuan; wheat rose from 680,000 yuan per *shi* to 820,000 yuan; and millet rose from 480,000 yuan per *shi* to 520,000 yuan. The Taiyuan newspapers have already admitted that "the common people are starving, and public employees have no food to eat. The combination of the two is a total collapse of society." Yan Xishan also admitted in his "High-Level Cadre Meeting": "The biggest crisis is the lack of food." Citizens are starving to death on the streets, which is often seen. The resident of 9 Guanghua Lane reported that an eight-year-old child who starved to death was abandoned at Taiyuan Middle School. Li, a military equipment officer in Xindian Yuan Village in the northern suburbs, committed suicide because he had no food, pulling apart two hand grenades at his waist.

　　太原粮食恐慌
    市民饿死街头
    【新华社晋绥七日电】太原粮荒严重，市民频于死亡。阎顽于五月十一日实行统制全城粮行，除军队可以自由买卖外，老百姓每人购粮不得超过五斤，并下令没有半年粮食的市民，不得在城内居住。每个“国民兵”需缴三石五斗米麦。市场粮价猛涨，从五月十五日到二十六日十天中，大米每石由八十二万元涨到九十万元；小麦每石由六十八万元涨到八十二万元；小米每石由四十八万元涨到五十二万元。太原报纸已承认“老百姓饿肚子，公教人员没饭吃，二者合一就是社会的总崩溃”。阎锡山在其“高干会”上亦供认：“最大的危机就是没有食粮。”市民饿毙于途，时有所见，光华里九号住户将饿死之八岁孩童，毙于太原中学。城北郊新店员村军械员李某，因无食粮，以两颗手榴弹横腰拉开，自戕而死。
