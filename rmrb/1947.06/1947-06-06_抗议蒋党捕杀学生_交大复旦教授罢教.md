Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: TASS reports, according to the Ta Kung Pao: On May 30th, professors at Shanghai Jiaotong University and Fudan University announced a strike to protest the Kuomintang police's arrest of students and illegal searches on campus. The Shanghai police submitted a "blacklist" containing the names of sixteen students to the Jiaotong University authorities, demanding the students be handed over. This was rejected by the university authorities. As a result of clashes between students and police on May 29th, twenty-six students were injured. On May 30th, police again opened fire on Jiaotong University students. According to the Ta Kung Wan Pao, three students were injured. Police forbade anyone from entering or leaving the campus. The university professors then decided to announce a strike. The report also stated that approximately 30% of the university's 3,500 students had been expelled from classrooms for voting in favor of continuing the struggle. Fudan University professors also issued a statement pointing out that the residences of the university president and other professors were also thoroughly searched by a group of secret agents with their faces covered by towels.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Beiping on the 2nd: Last night, 1,500 college students in North China gathered at Peking University. The students declared that the only way to achieve democracy in China "is to use our own blood to kill the dictators." The ceremony took place in the "Democracy Square" in the stadium. The students represented thirteen universities and specialized schools. A green flag inscribed with the characters "Democracy" was placed in front of the girls' dormitory for the "June 2nd" anti-civil war general strike. A student leader claimed that since the end of the war, "Chinese fascists have created floods for their own purposes; Eastern fascists live in luxury and corruption, while the people are starving." Female students presented flowers to the nine students who were beaten in the recent demonstrations to pay their respects.
