　　Yexian County Party Committee Issues Emergency Call
    Persist in Guerrilla Warfare, Implement Land Reform
    [Special Dispatch] (Xinhua News Agency) The Yexian County Party Committee, based on the overall situation in the county and the development of mass movements, has issued an urgent directive on the issue of further mobilizing the masses, calling on cadres to immediately prepare ideologically and organizationally to persist in implementing land reform during the people's guerrilla war. It pointed out that in the past month, the broad masses of peasants in the county have reached out to us, asking for wheat, land, a chance to "enjoy themselves," and to "quench their thirst," and expressed their willingness to struggle, to settle accounts, and to pour out their grievances. We must give a definite and fulfilled response and satisfaction to this urgent demand of the masses until the goal of "land to the tiller" is thoroughly realized. Therefore, the current general policy of the county is still to carry out the thorough mobilization of the masses in the development of guerrilla warfare, and to further mobilize the masses through anti-traitor liquidation, and the distribution of wheat and land. The border areas should focus on developing guerrilla warfare and boldly mobilizing the masses to combat the enemy's seizure of wheat, while the rear areas should also boldly and rapidly mobilize. It is required that every village be ignited, the whole county be set ablaze, and that widespread action be immediately fulfilled, with active elements in every village. After a mass summary movement in Xiatun, a comprehensive general liquidation movement against the landlord class can be introduced. In implementing the above policies, it is required that each district create a foothold: drive in pins piece by piece (with some good villages in a piece), and take root in every village. Finally, it calls on Party and non-Party comrades to urgently mobilize, seize the time to mobilize the masses day and night, and make great contributions to the people in the guerrilla warfare and land reform movement, with one hand holding a gun and the other distributing land.

　　邺县县委紧急号召
    坚持游击战争贯彻土地改革
    【又讯】邺县县委根据全县环境，及群运发展情况，对于更进一步放手发动群众问题，特发出紧急指示，号召干部在思想上组织上立即作坚持群众游击战争中贯彻土地改革的准备。指出一月来全县广大农民向我们伸出手来要麦子、要土地、要“过瘾”、要“解渴”，并表示敢斗争、敢清算、敢诉苦，我们对群众这个迫切要求，必须给以肯定兑现的答复和满足，直到彻底实现耕者有其田为止。因此全县当前的总方针，仍是在开展游击战争中贯彻放手发动群众，通过反奸清算，分麦、分田达到更进一步的发动群众。边地以开展游击为重点，放手发动群众打击敌人抢麦，后边地区也要大胆迅速发动。要求达到村村点火全县冒烟，广泛行动马上兑现，村村有积极层。夏屯后来一个群众性的总结运动，接着即可引入全面向地主阶级开展总清算运动。在贯彻以上方针中，要求每区都要创造下立脚点：片片打下针，（一片有些好村），村村扎下根。最后号召，党与非党同志紧急动员起来，争取时间昼夜不停的发动群众，在一手拿枪一手分田的游击战争与土地改革运动中为人民立大功。
