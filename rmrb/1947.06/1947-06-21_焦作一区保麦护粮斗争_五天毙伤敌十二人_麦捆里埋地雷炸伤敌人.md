　　JiaoZuo First District Struggle to Protect Wheat and Defend Grain
    Five Days of Killing and Wounding Twelve Enemies
    Landmines Buried in Wheat Bundles Injure Enemies
    [Our Dispatch] In JiaoZuo First District, 396 mu of wheat along the river were harvested in five days and five nights, and more than 60 threshing grounds were worked, threshing 69 shi of wheat. From NianPanGou, over 3 shi of wheat seized from local tyrants was brought back. Women and children staying behind in the central area weeded more than 30 mu of millet seedlings. Armed achievements: One ambush, 1 enemy killed and 3 wounded; one assault, 3 enemies wounded; rifle fire wounded 1 enemy, and landmines wounded 4 enemies (including one platoon leader). A total of 12 enemies were killed or wounded.
    Future plans: (1) Finish threshing the river wheat in two to three days and hide the grain well. (2) Expand the armed work team in the river area by 5 people in three to five days, and expand the northern millet area in the central area by two to three people. (3) Pay public grain on time. The armed forces should move forward to set up ambushes and capture special agents and local tyrants.
    [Another Dispatch] The XuHe landmine team buried a landmine in a wheat bundle in WangZhangHe on the first day. Early the next morning, Chiang's troops from ShangBaiZuo arrived. Because the wheat cut yesterday had not been carried away, Chiang's troops from JiaoZuo arrived early to carry it away, causing an argument between the two sides. They fought over a pile of wheat bundles, and unexpectedly detonated the mine. Three or four were blown down and carried back on chairs.

    麦捆里埋地雷炸伤敌人
    【本报讯】焦作一区五天五夜割完河道麦子三百九十六亩，打麦六十余场，打出麦子六十九石，到碾盘沟背回恶霸麦子打了三石二，中围留家的妇女儿童锄谷苗三十多亩。武装成绩：埋伏一次，敌死一伤三；冲锋一次，敌伤三；排子枪伤敌一，地雷伤敌四，（内排长一）。共计敌死伤十二人。
    今后计划：（一）河道在二天至三天打完场，藏好粮。（二）三天至五天河道扩大武工队五人，中围北粟扩大二至三人。（三）按期缴公粮，缴好的。武装要向前深入打埋伏，捕捉特务恶霸。
    【又讯】许河地雷小组头一天在王张河麦捆里埋下地雷，第二天一早，上白作蒋军来了。因昨天割下麦没有担，焦作蒋军来的早，给他们担去，两方面吵起嘴来，他们争抢麦捆围了一堆，猛不防把雷弄响；崩倒了三四个，用椅子抬回去了。
