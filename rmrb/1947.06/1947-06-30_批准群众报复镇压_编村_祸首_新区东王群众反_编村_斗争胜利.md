　　Approval of Mass Retaliation and Suppression of "Village Compilation" Culprits
    Victory in the Anti-"Village Compilation" Struggle of the Masses in Dongwang, New District

    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 28th] Proceeding from the urgent demands of the masses, Dongwang Village in Ronghe convened a mass meeting on June 11th to launch a movement of grievance airing and revenge against Wang Yongzheng, Wang Hude, and Wang Shengduo, the murderous culprits of the Yan stubborn's "Village Compilation 'Oil Press'" (the masses gave it this name because the village compilation was excessively exploitative). The masses airing their grievances were filled with grief and indignation. Wang Cunhuan, a 13-year-old child, recounted how Wang Yongzheng and others murdered his father, demanding that the culprits be severely punished to avenge his father. Zhu Wenyun, a 56-year-old coppersmith, whose son was buried alive by Wang Yongzheng, and his wife cried bitterly when recounting the murder of their son. The more they recounted, the more bitter it became, and the masses were filled with rage, shouting, "Revenge for grievances, redress for injustices!" They unanimously demanded that the government execute Wang Yongzheng and distribute his family property. After Wang Hude and Wang Shengduo were investigated, they were handed over to the government for handling. The government accepted the demands of the masses and executed Wang Yongzheng by firing squad, which was met with universal acclaim, with people shouting, "The Blue Sky Eighth Route Army is helping the people to stand up!" In this instance, the masses obtained 166 mu of land, four head of livestock, two and a half houses, two threshing grounds, and 44 shi of grain. The newspaper also published a short commentary, pointing out that the direct tool used by Yan Xishan to rule the peasants was "Village Compilation." Therefore, what the peasants hated most directly was also "Village Compilation." The most popular folk song in Southern Shanxi says: "Second War Zone, Living King Yama, 'Oil Press' of Village Compilation fights in the front, King Yama sits in the Yama Palace, little devils are sent to the villages, forcing us men to run away to other places, women to hang themselves, and children to cry for their mothers." This shows how deep and painful the masses' grievances against Village Compilation are, and how urgent their desire for revenge is. They are now shouting everywhere: "To stand up, fight Village Compilation! To liberate, fight the Oil Press!" The victory of the masses in Dongwang, Ronghe, in overthrowing Village Compilation is precisely because they were able to proceed from the most urgent demands of the masses, thus mobilizing the masses and creating favorable conditions for realizing land to the tillers. The comrades in the recovered areas must be good at grasping this principle, starting from the masses' most urgent demand to oppose "Village Compilation," and approve the masses' retaliatory actions against the most heinous pseudo-stubborn personnel, and launch the land reform struggle.

　　批准群众报复镇压“编村”祸首
    新区东王群众反“编村”斗争胜利
    【本报太岳二十八日电】荣河东王村从群众迫切要求出发，于六月十一日召集群众大会，向阎顽编村“油坊”（群众因编村压榨过甚，故以此名称之。）的杀人祸首王永正、王虎的、王盛铎展开诉苦复仇运动，诉苦群众悲愤交加，十三岁的小孩王存焕诉说到王永正等谋害他父亲时，要求严办祸首为父报仇。五十六岁的铜匠朱文运的儿子被王永正活埋，朱文运夫妇诉到儿子被杀害时，痛哭失声。越诉越苦，群情沸腾，全场怒吼：“有仇报仇，有冤伸冤”，一致要求政府将王永正处死，并分配其家产。王虎的、王盛铎清算后交政府处理，政府接受群众要求，将王永正枪决，群众莫不称快，狂呼：“青天八路军，帮助老百姓翻身”。此次群众获得土地一百六十六亩，牲口四头，房两所半，场二个，粮食四十四石。该报同时发表短评，指出阎锡山统治农民的直接工具就是“编村”，因此，农民直接最痛恨的也是“编村”，晋南最流行的民谣说：“二战区，活阎王，编村‘油坊’打前方，阎王坐下阎罗殿，小鬼派到村里边，逼的咱，男的跑外乡，女的悬了梁，小孩吱吱哭他娘”。可见群众对编村的冤恨是何等深痛，而要求报仇雪恨之心又是何等急迫，现正到处呼喊着：“要翻身打编村，要解放打油坊”。荣河东王群众打垮编村，正是因为能从群众迫切要求出发，故能发动起群众来，并且打下实现耕者有其田的有利条件。收复区的同志们要善于掌握这一原则，从群众当前最迫切的要求反“编村”出发，并批准群众对罪大恶极的伪顽人员的报复行为，开展土地改革斗争。
