　　Licheng, Wang Tonghui
    Carefully Drafts Famine Relief Plan
    [This newspaper's Licheng News] Border Region Labor Hero Wang Tonghui convened a meeting of his entire family on June 4th to establish a plan for thrift and famine relief production, and resolved to exceed the task, with the whole family striving to earn merit. The plan is as follows:
    I. Thrift: The entire family of seven previously ate yellow corn cakes. From June onwards, they will mix bran into their food. For the first ten days, the ratio will be three parts bran to seven parts corn. For the middle ten days, it will be four parts bran to six parts corn. For the last ten days, it will be a 50/50 mix. In this way, they will save an average of at least half a *sheng* of corn per day, saving one and a half *dou* per month. Previously, they ate river snails once every five days; from now on, they will eat them once every ten days, saving a total of three *sheng* of corn. Previously, they ate rice every day at noon; from now on, they will eat bran cakes six times a month, saving one *sheng* of millet each time, for a total saving of six *sheng*. Previously, they needed one and a half *sheng* of rice each noon; from now on, they will eat more wild vegetables, saving three *he* each noon, for a saving of seven *sheng* of millet in twenty-four days (not counting the six days of eating bran cakes). The whole family can save a total of one *dou* and eight *sheng* of corn and one *dou* and three *sheng* of millet (large *dou*) per month. If these three *dou* and one *sheng* of coarse and fine grains are stored, they can survive the famine for more than ten days.
    II. Production: The family has two head of livestock, two and a half male laborers, and two female laborers. The millet needs to be pulled now, and the corn can also be weeded. The two and a half male laborers can work seventy-five days a month. Participation in the war, supporting the front, substitute plowing, and meetings require thirty-three workdays (of which twenty workdays are earned through participation in the war and supporting the front, equivalent to eight *jin* per day, totaling one hundred and sixty *jin* of millet). Twenty workdays are needed to pull all ten *mu* of millet, and six workdays are needed to weed all six *mu* of corn once. The remaining sixteen workdays will be used by nine laborers to do three transport runs (previously they did two runs). The three transport runs can earn 9,000 *yang*. The remaining seven workdays can be exchanged for an equivalent of forty-two *jin* of millet in the mutual aid group (excluding six *jin* per workday for food). The two female laborers, in addition to grinding flour, sewing clothes, cooking, taking care of children, and feeding pigs, can each spin an average of two *liang* of cotton per day, for a total of seven and a half *jin* per month, which can be woven into four *zhang* and five *chi* of cloth. After deducting the cost, the net gain is two *zhang*, six *chi*, and seven *cun* of cloth, which, at 200 *yang* per *chi*, can earn 5,340 *yang*. Raising one sow can produce two litters of piglets a year, with six piglets per litter (one litter has already been born), for a total of twelve piglets. At 2,500 *yang* per piglet, the income is 30,000 *yang*. Transportation, spinning, and pig raising can earn a total of 16,840 *yang*. After deducting daily expenses for salt, oil, and miscellaneous items of 3,800 *yang*, the net gain is over 13,000 *yang*. If this is converted into millet, it can buy 176 *jin*. Adding the equivalent of millet earned from agricultural support, there is a surplus of 328 *jin* of millet. If this millet is stored to prepare for famine years (one *jin* per person per day), it can feed them for fifty-four days. Combining the production and thrift measures, they can survive the famine for a total of sixty-four days. After calculating and discussing the plan in this way, the whole family is highly motivated and determined to exceed the task, with the whole family earning merit.

　　黎城王同会
    细订备荒计划
    【本报黎城讯】边区劳动英雄王同会于六月四号召集全家大小订出节约备荒生产计划，并决心要超过任务，全家争取立功。其计划为：
    一、节约方面：全家大小七口人，以前吃的是黄疙瘩，自六月份起要掺糠吃，前十天按三七掺（糠三、玉茭七）中十天按四六掺，后十天按对半掺，这样每天平均最少节约半升玉茭，一月可节约一斗半，以前五天吃一顿河＠，今后十天一顿，共可节约三升玉茭，以前天天晌午吃米，今后一月内要吃六顿糠疙瘩，每顿节省一升小米，共省六升，以前每午需米一升半，今后多吃野菜，每午节约三合，二十四天节约七升小米（六天吃糠疙瘩不算）。全月全家共可节省玉茭一斗八升，小米一斗三升（大斗），如果把这三斗一升粗细粮食存起来，渡灾荒可渡十天多。
    二、生产方面：全家牲口两头，男全劳力两个半，女劳力两个，现谷已需要拔，玉茭也锄得了，两个半男劳力一月可出工七十五个。参战、支差、代耕、开会等需工三十三个，（内有二十个工是参战、支差赚等价，每天八斤，共合一百六十斤小米），十亩谷全拔出来需工二十个，六亩玉茭全锄一遍需工六个，余下十六个工抽出九个劳力工搞三次运输（以前搞两次）。三次共可赚洋九千元，其余七个工在互助组中变工可赚等价米四十二斤（除吃每工六斤），两个妇女全劳力每天除推磨、缝衣、做饭、看小孩、喂猪外，每人平均纺二两花、一月共纺七斤半，织成四丈五尺布，除本，净长布二丈六尺七寸，每尺以二百元计，可赚洋五千三百四十元，喂母猪一口，一年可下两窝小猪，每窝六个（现已下了一窝），共下十二个，每个以二千五百元计，可收入三万元；运输、纺织、喂猪共赚洋一万六千八百四十元；除每日吃盐、打油杂支等三千八百元外，净长洋一万三千余元，如果买成小米，可买一百七十六斤，连上农业支差等价可余小米三百二十八斤，如果把米存起来防备荒年，（每人每天一斤）可吃五十四天。生产节约两项合起来，共可渡荒六十四天，经过这样算账讨论出计划来，全家劲头很大，提出决心要超过任务，全家都立功。
