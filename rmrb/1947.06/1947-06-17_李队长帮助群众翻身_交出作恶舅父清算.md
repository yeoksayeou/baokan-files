　　Captain Li Helps the Masses Overturn Their Situation
    Hands Over Villainous Uncle for Liquidation
    [Our Newspaper’s Report] Captain Li, of a certain radio station in Taiyue, maintained a firm stance and handed over his villainous uncle for the people to deal with. His uncle, Zhao Yuliang (using the alias Wu Suifu), was from Xiagu Village in Wuxiang. For more than ten years, he had made a fortune by lending money at high interest rates. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he lived in Duancun and had led the Japanese to surround the village twice. The masses hated him to the bone. Last year, when the masses rose up to struggle against him, he seized the opportunity to escape to Jincheng. A section chief in Jincheng introduced him to hide in a shop. This spring, when the masses went to Jincheng to arrest him, he fled upon hearing the news, obtained a travel permit from a certain bureau in Taihang, and returned to a certain place in Taiyue on April 1st to find Captain Li. After Captain Li inquired about the reasons, he said to him, "You should still go back and let the masses deal with you!" Zhao Yuliang repeatedly pleaded, but Captain Li remained unmoved and immediately reported to the military law office, detained him, and sent him back to his hometown for the masses to deal with.
