　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Moscow dispatch: The 22nd of this month was the sixth anniversary of Hitler's Germany's attack on the Soviet Union. Soviet newspapers published essays commemorating the Great Patriotic War, reminiscences by military figures, experiences of veteran soldiers, and descriptions of the locations where the war broke out in 1941. "Pravda" also published an editorial entitled "The Great Soviet People – Heroes and Creators." The editorial first pointed out: Hitler took advantage of the fact that there was no second battlefield in Europe for three years and threw all 240 of his divisions into the Soviet-German front, but the Red Army finally defeated and annihilated the main force of the enemy. By the end of the third year of the war, the Soviet Union could independently occupy all of Germany and liberate France. It was this situation that forced Churchill, who had initially opposed opening a second battlefield, to advocate an invasion of northern France. Contrary to the assertions of certain foreign news agencies, it was the Soviet Union that saved humanity and world civilization and ensured that the Allies successfully entered Europe and victoriously ended World War II. The editorial continued: On the morning of June 22, 1947, the Soviet people, heroes, and creators, were engaged in intense peaceful construction, once again demonstrating their invincible strength. The editorial concluded by declaring: The Soviet Union sincerely wishes to cooperate peacefully with all countries that have the same sincerity, but at the same time, it is vigilant against the conspiracies and provocations of warmongers. As for the warmongers, let the sixth anniversary of the Great Patriotic War once again remind them of what will be the result of attempts to attack the Soviet Union.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: New York dispatch: June 22nd was the sixth anniversary of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union. The Chicago branch of the American-Soviet Friendship Association held a banquet on the 21st to commemorate the occasion. Guests included Soviet Ambassador Novikov and more than 400 others. At the meeting, the chairman of the branch, Card, and Colonel Foss, the representative of the Mayor of Chicago, both strongly promoted friendly cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union. Novikov delivered a long speech, stating that after defeating Hitler's so-called "invincible" Germany, the Soviet people are engaged in large-scale peaceful construction with the same self-sacrifice and heroic spirit to avoid any infringement and coercion. The Soviet Union's desire for universal peace and security is reflected in its efforts in every international diplomatic affair and has become a powerful condition for consolidating peace and security. Novikov condemned the attempts of warmongers in certain countries to undermine peace and incite war, especially the slander that the United States and the Soviet Union cannot cooperate. Novikov said that the Soviet Union welcomes friendly cooperation with other countries, especially with the United States.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: TASS, New York dispatch: The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association recently held a "Soviet-American Relations Conference" in New York. 350 people attended the conference. The leaders of the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, Melekh and Cowlis Lamont, served as chairmen. Gordon, a Middle East correspondent for the Toronto Star, criticized the United States' military aid to Turkey in his speech at the meeting, saying that this aid was "wrong and dangerous." Epstein, a former United Press correspondent in the Far East, condemned the United States' aid to anti-democratic elements in the Far East. Cowlis Lamont declared that the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association is determined to fight against the unconstitutional actions of the House "Committee on Un-American Activities," which has hindered the activities of the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association. Dr. Harry Ward declared that American monopolists are threatening world peace by trying to force their system on the whole world and are also depriving the American people of their democratic rights and freedoms.
