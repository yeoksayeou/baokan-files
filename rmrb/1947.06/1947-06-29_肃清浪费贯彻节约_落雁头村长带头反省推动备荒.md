　　Eliminate Waste and Implement Thrift
    Luoyantou Village Chief Takes the Lead in Self-Reflection and Promotes Famine Preparations
    [Our newspaper, Xiyang News] Village Chief of Luoyantou Village overcomes waste and practices thrift, promoting thrift and famine preparations throughout the village. The village chief, Li Weiming, has a family of five and used to be very poor, farming ten mu of rented land. After paying rent every year, they had nothing left to eat. He worked as a hired laborer for more than ten years. Since the mass movement began, he has obtained fifteen mu of land, half a head of cattle and a donkey, ten pieces of clothing, two farm tools, three shi of grain, and three thousand yuan in silver, and he turned over. He started wasting from July last year. At that time, he thought: Landlords used to eat well and dress well, now that we have turned over, we should be happy for a couple of days. So he didn't eat the regular meals his wife cooked, he only wanted to eat Helao noodles, pancakes, and white flour; he didn't wear torn clothes anymore, and he smoked cigarettes constantly when he went to the city for meetings. As a result, from last year to now, he bought a total of seven bolts of cloth (using four shi of grain), and between eating and wearing, he wasted the fifteen shi he harvested last year and the three shi he was allocated, leaving only two shi and three dou. The three thousand yuan in silver that was allocated was used up buying cigarettes. In early June this year, he became anxious because of the drought. His wife calculated the accounts for him, and he finally understood. He remembered the poor days in the past: in autumn, one dou of corn mixed with four dou of coarse chaff, no grain in summer, eating tree leaves and wild vegetables, suffering like that. Now wasting is forgetting poverty, he is not aware of it himself, and he picked up the landlord's soul. He deeply regretted it and resolved to correct himself, to live a thrifty life. So he convened a family meeting and democratically discussed a thrift plan. The whole family decided to save a handful of rice per meal, and the remaining one shi and three dou of rice could save five more dou. One shi of corn mixed with one shi of chaff would be enough to eat, without having to buy more. Clothes should be worn with patches, and shoes should be patched. His thrift slogan is: "No sesame cakes, no thick soups, cornmeal dumplings are exchanged for dou-to-dou (one dou of corn for one dou of chaff). Save a handful of rice per meal, no need to worry about eating and drinking for a year." Since the thrift plan was made, he has led everyone in the mutual aid group, reviewing the current waste, and proposed: "Saving a handful of rice per meal is not too little, wasting a handful of rice is not too much." During the discussion, everyone agreed that women play an important role in controlling thrift, and immediately convened a village women's meeting to mobilize them. Li Jichen's wife said: "Our family of seven can easily save one sheng of grain a day, which will save three shi and six dou a year." Now all seventy households in the village are actively brewing, and households eating cornmeal are mixing it with chaff. More than twenty households, including Li Jinliang's, are actively responding and discussing specific plans. A vigorous thrift and famine preparation movement has begun throughout the village. (Ziyou, Xin Ying)
    [Our newspaper, Wu'an News] A sixty-four-year-old Li Zhang of Ye Tao promoted thrift and famine preparations with his own exemplary actions. After hearing the call for thrift, he went back and asked his wife to grind chaff flour (although his personal farming was more than enough). At mealtime, everyone was surprised to see him eating chaff buns and said, "Have you old folks forgotten about death?!" He said that the government is calling on us all to eat chaff, it is drought, the savings are our own, but the masses still did not quite believe it. In the evening, he gathered everyone for a meeting. He calculated the accounts for everyone and said: two sheng of corn for one sheng of chaff, this chaff cannot be considered bad, this way everyone can save three liang of corn a day, our eighth li, sixty-four households, one hundred and twenty-six people, can save twenty-three jin and ten liang a day. In addition, each person saves one liang of rice a day is not too much, one day is seven jin and fourteen liang. At this time, everyone's thoughts were clear, and the whole li acted in this way.

　　肃清浪费贯彻节约
    落雁头村长带头反省推动备荒
    【本报昔阳讯】落雁头村长克服浪费厉行节约，推动全村节约备荒。该村村长李维明，全家五口人，过去很穷，种租地十亩，年年交了租没有吃，曾当雇工十余年。自开展群运以后，得到土地十五亩，牛、驴各半头，衣服十件，农具两件，粮食三石，大洋三千元，翻了身。从去年七月起开始浪费，当时认为：地主过去好吃好穿，咱现在翻身啦，也该高兴两天。所以老婆给作下家常饭也不吃啦，光想吃点河捞、煎饼、白面；破衣裳也不穿啦，下城开会纸烟不断。这样一来，从去年到现在共买了七匹布（用粮食四石），连吃带穿把去年打下的十五石、分下的三石，浪费的只留下二石三斗，分下的大洋三千元，买纸烟吸完啦。在今年六月初，由于天旱不雨，才着了急。老婆又给他算了个帐，这一下思想才通了。他想起过去的穷光景：秋天一斗玉茭搅四斗粗糠，夏天不见粮食，吃树叶、吃野菜，那样受罪，现在浪费是忘了穷，自己不觉悟，拾起地主魂。他十分后悔，决心改正，勤俭节约过光景，这样便召开了家庭会，民主商订节约计划。全家决定每顿节省一把米，所留一石三斗米还能省五斗，把一石玉茭搅上一石糠就能够吃，不用再籴。衣服要穿有补绽的，要穿打掌鞋。他节约的行动口号是：“不烧饼，不调糊，玉茭面窝窝换成斗碰斗（一斗玉茭一斗糠）。每顿节省一把米，一年吃喝不用愁。”自从订出节约计划后，他便在互助组里领导大家，检讨了现在的浪费，并提出：“一顿饭省一把米不显稀，费一把米不显稠。”在讨论中，大家都认为妇女掌握节约很重要，随即召开了全村妇女会，进行了动员，李吉辰老婆说：“俺家七口人，一天省一升粮食不费事，一年下来就能节省三石六斗。”现在全村七十户，都在纷纷酝酿，吃玉茭面的户都搅上糠啦，并有李金良等二十来户，积极响应，正在商讨具体计划，全村已展开轰轰烈烈的节约备荒运动。（子由、新颖）
    【本报武安讯】冶陶六十四岁老闾长，以自己模范行动推动节约备荒。他听到节约号召之后，回去便叫他老婆磨糠面（虽然他个人耕一余一也够了）。饭市上大家对他吃糠窝窝很惊异说：“您老两口忘了死啦！”他说政府号召咱们都吃糠哩，天旱了，省下的还是自己的，但群众还有些不大相信。晚上他召集大家开了个会，他给大家算算帐说：二升玉茭一升糠，这糠不能算赖，这样每人一天就能省三两玉茭，咱们第八闾六十四户一百二十六口人，一天就省二十三斤十两。另外每人一天省下一两米不算多，一天就是七斤十四两。这时大家的思想都通了，全闾就这样行动起来了。
