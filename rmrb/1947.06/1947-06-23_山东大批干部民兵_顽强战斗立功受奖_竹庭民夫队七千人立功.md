Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st—Large numbers of cadres and militia in Shandong, in areas taken back from the enemy, have been awarded for their meritorious service in the struggle against the enemy. In the Binhai District, the number of county and district cadres who performed meritorious service by early May reached 86. Guo Yuntai, an armed affairs officer in Junan County, led the Binhai First Pioneer Demolition Team deep into Tancheng, setting off 20 thunderous explosions at Mount Fu, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy; Guo continued to fight despite coughing up blood. Liang Ruren, the Donghai County Party Committee, personally led a working team into the Puxi District, capturing 33 members of the "Homecoming Corps" in one operation. Zhang Guangming, an armed forces member in the Shengjing District of Laiwu, persisted in fighting in the original location, organizing the masses and militia, ensuring that 300,000 jin of public grain remained safe despite the Kuomintang army's search. In Jiaodong and Nan Ye and other places, Ji Renxian, Wang Chunlong and other 154 militia members killed, wounded, and captured 141 Kuomintang and puppet secret agents. Zuo Taichuan and others from the Mobile Guerrilla Flying Demolition Team on the Xin (Tai) Lai (Wu) Meng (Yin) front line in central Shandong cut 350 jin of electric wire in one night, planted mines 55 times in ten days, and killed, wounded, and captured a total of 52 enemies in combat. The Armed Forces Department of the Central Shandong Military Region awarded Zuo Taichuan a special merit once, and awarded Zuo and the team with the glorious titles of "Central Shandong Flying Demolition King" and "Central Shandong Zuo Taichuan Demolition King Team." The team led by Duan Mingkai in Laiwu fought 21 times, rushed and transported public grain seven times, totaling more than 50,000 jin, helped the masses in five villages, and suppressed landlords and bad elements. The team won a collective first-class merit.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 20th—The Zhuting Civilian Labor Team of more than 9,000 people completed the task of rescuing and transferring the wounded in the blocking operations in Mengyin and other places, creating an excellent record for the Binhai front-line support civilian labor force. After five days of long-distance night marching, when the second and fifth brigades of the team were rescuing and transporting the wounded, the Kuomintang army fired more than 40 shells at them in succession, and American planes circled and strafed around them. They calmly concealed the wounded and comforted them: "We must get all the comrades down." The wounded encouraged each other: "This is a smelting furnace, it is time for us to perform meritorious service." Finally, all 53 wounded were sent to a village 20 miles away, and the entire team was awarded a collective merit once. Two companies of the Second Brigade quickly completed the task of rescuing and transferring the wounded in front of Qingtuo Temple in just over 20 minutes. The leaders of the troops praised them in a letter of condolence as "unprecedented" good civilian laborers. Their relationship with the troops is also unprecedentedly close. In the gaps in service at the front line, the Second and Third Brigades held a joint celebration meeting with the troops, and automatically donated nearly 100,000 yuan and 30 jin of chaff to the wounded. The troops also donated a lot of clothing and shoes to solve their difficulties. When they were about to be demobilized, the troop leaders, hospitals, and wounded all sent letters of thanks, and presented three large flags and guns and ammunition respectively. The Binhai Frontline Support Command issued a circular commending the Zhuting Civilian Labor Team as a model stretcher team. Among the 9,126 members of the two teams, 7,736 performed meritorious service. They were awarded the words "Glorious Meritorious Service" and called on cadres at all levels supporting the front line and heroic civilian laborers to emulate them.
