Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 4th: Comprehensive reports: Since Gasperi announced the establishment of a so-called "single-party" government, excluding representatives of left-wing parties (Socialist Party and Communist Party) from the government, it has first aroused a wave of righteous indignation in northern Italy. Workers in major factories in Milan and its suburbs have held protest rallies. The movement against the organization of a new government without the participation of labor parties quickly spread throughout the country. Factories have held meetings and passed resolutions protesting the anti-popular actions of the Christian Democratic Party leadership, and Catholic workers have also participated in the meetings and demonstrations. Two large shipyards in Naples and Pozzuoli held passionate protest rallies. Workers in the Terni industrial area stopped work in protest. Railway employees and workers in the Genoa, Savona, and Sestri areas have passed resolutions condemning the reactionary government established by Gasperi's manipulation. Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti wrote in *Unità* that Gasperi completely lacked the parliamentary basis for establishing a "presidential" cabinet. Togliatti wrote: "During the government crisis, I met with Mr. Gasperi five times, but Mr. Gasperi never talked about any issue of the program, but only spoke generally about government institutions, and Gasperi encountered our opposition many times. Therefore, Gasperi's decision to sever relations with the parliamentary majority is illegitimate; whether from a parliamentary or from a general democratic point of view, Gasperi's decision cannot be considered legitimate." Many newspapers have reported that the Italian Ministry of the Interior has adopted special decrees to "maintain order." Interior Minister Scelba (Christian Democrat) ordered all local officials to mobilize police and troops to "deal with any emergency." Police reinforcements in Rome and Milan patrolled the streets and suburbs at night.

　　反对加斯贝利组织反动政府
    全意大利工人游行示威
    【新华社陕北四日电】综合报导：自加斯贝利宣布成立所谓“清一色”政府，并由政府中排除左翼政党（社会党与共产党）代表之后，首先在意大利北部激起了义愤的怒潮。米兰及其近郊各大工厂的工人，均举行抗议大会。反对组织没有劳工政党参加之新政府的运动，很快即普及全国。各工厂纷纷开会通过决议，抗议基督教民主党领导机关反人民的作法，天主教工人也参加了会议和示威游行。那不勒斯与波苏尔里的两个大造船厂都举行了激昂的抗议大会。特尼工业区的工人停止以示抗议。热那亚、萨窝那、塞斯特里等地区的铁路员工和工人都通过决议，谴责由于加斯贝利玩弄手段而成立的反动政府。意共领袖托格利亚蒂在《团结报》上撰文声称：加斯贝利完全没有建立“主席制”内阁的议会基础。托格利亚蒂写道：“当政府危机之际，我曾与加氏会晤五次，但加氏从未谈及纲领的任何一个问题，而只泛论政府机构，而且加斯贝利碰到了我们这方面多次的反对。因此，加斯贝利决议与议会多数派断绝关系是不正当的；不论从议会或从民主的一般观点来说，加氏之决议不能算是合法的。”许多报纸都报导：意大利内政部已采取“维持秩序”之特别法令。内政部长捷尔巴（基督教民主党人）命令一切地方长官动员警察及军队“应付任何紧急事变”。罗马及米兰增防的警察队，入夜即在街上及城郊巡逻。
