Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. TASS Moscow Dispatch: Izvestia published an article on the issue of disarmament, stating: American newspapers and the US Congress are considering two hundred different military proposals. Six months have passed since the proposal for general disarmament was placed on the UN agenda. The Soviet Union has proposed practical suggestions to speed up disarmament most rapidly, but the representatives of certain other countries, especially the United States and Britain, have adopted a policy of delaying this issue from the beginning. As the UN General Assembly resolution specifically emphasized the close link between security issues and disarmament issues, the US and British representatives attempted to separate these two issues. They said the establishment of a security system should precede the issue of disarmament. They also said that disarmament is impossible before mutual trust is established among countries and the most important international issues are resolved. The UN General Assembly also emphasized the close relationship between the issue of disarmament and the issue of atomic energy control. Here, the US and British representatives again attempted to separate the two issues. All these suggestions from the US and British representatives run counter to the UN General Assembly resolution. This attempt by the United States, Britain, and certain other countries is to turn the United Nations back to the tragic era of the League of Nations, at that time, the lengthy and futile discussions in various committees and disarmament conferences were merely a mask for the arms race. In American history, there has never been such a large army as it maintains now. The US government's military budget makes each American family bear an average of $300, while the pre-war military budget only made each family bear an average of $36. The US Army has not only not been demobilized but has increased to more than four times its pre-war size, and the Navy has also increased sharply. The United States is now discussing a compulsory military service bill and establishing a special administrative organization for wartime industrial mobilization. America's neighbors, Canada and Mexico, are very weak, so these measures cannot be justified by the interests of national defense. What American newspapers and magazines have recently publicized is the plan for unlimited expansion and the establishment of global strategic bases, which is a clear explanation of this "offensive spirit." American newspapers not only do not talk about the demobilization plan of the military industry but instead call for the mobilization of the military industry. All these facts are inconsistent with the statement of the chief representative of the United States to the United Nations, Austin, who said that no country in the world is more loyal to the cause of disarmament than the United States. Regardless of serious economic difficulties, Britain maintains an army of over one million, and 15% of British men are still serving in the army. In the one or two years after the end of the war, Britain's military budget also increased significantly. The British Parliament is also discussing a universal conscription bill. This is the background against which US and British representatives declare their allegiance to the cause of disarmament in the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. TASS Moscow Dispatch: Izvestia recently published an article by Alexeyev on universal reduction of armaments, stating: Since the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on the principles of universal adjustment and reduction of armaments, there has been no progress in the implementation of the resolution, except that the Security Council has established an ordinary armaments committee. The Security Council stipulated that the ordinary armaments committee should submit a specific plan for universal adjustment and reduction of armaments measures within three months. This deadline expired on May 12. The committee did not complete this instruction, and its work was limited to empty discussions of issues related to universal reduction of armaments, and could not bring the United Nations closer to fulfilling the tasks set by the General Assembly. For example, British representative Jebb confused the entire issue of universal reduction of armaments. Jebb argued that even if a plan for universal reduction of armaments is successfully and completely formulated, it cannot be implemented until international trust is established. However, preparing to implement measures to reduce armaments is a sign of international trust. US representative Johnson also adopted exactly the same attitude as the British representative. He complicated the argument for universal reduction of armaments even further. The speeches of the representatives of Britain and the United States in the ordinary armaments committee prove this conclusion, that their efforts are not aimed at implementing the resolution of the General Assembly as soon as possible, but rather at delaying the implementation of the resolution. The article concludes by saying: The interests of peace and security require the ordinary armaments committee to accurately follow the resolution of the General Assembly and quickly complete the formulation of a specific implementation plan for universal adjustment and reduction of armaments.

### 美英反动派扩张军备  破坏联合国裁军决议  苏联消息报著文指责

　　美英反动派扩张军备
    破坏联合国裁军决议
    苏联消息报著文指责
    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报刊载关于裁军问题之论文称：美国报纸，美国会正在考虑二百件不同之军事议案。自普遍裁军建议列入联合国议事日程以后，已经过去六个月了，苏联曾提出首在最迅速裁军之实际建议，但某些其它国家，特别是美国与英国的代表，从一开始即采取了拖延此一问题的方针。如联大决议曾特别强调安全问题与裁军问题间之密切联系，但美英代表，则企图分开这两个问题，他们说安全制度的建立应在裁军问题以前，他们又说在各国间互相信任以前，最重要的国际问题解决以前，进行裁军是不可能的。联大并强调裁军问题与原子能管制问题间的密切关系，在这里美英代表又企图将两个问题分开。美英代表的所有这些建议，都是与联大的决议背道而驰的。美国英国及某些其他国家的这种企图，是想把联合国扭转到国联的悲惨时代去，在那个时候，各委员会与裁军会议中的冗长和徒劳无益的讨论，不过是作军备竞赛的面具而已。在美国历史上，从没有保持过象现在这样庞大的军队，美国政府之军事预算，使美国每一家庭平均担负三百美元之巨，而战前之军事预算，使每一家庭仅平均担负三十六美元。美国陆军不惟未告复员，且增加至战前四倍之多，而海军亦遽形增加。美国现正讨论强迫兵役法案，并创立特别行政机构，以为战时动员工业之用。美国的邻国加拿大与墨西哥都是很弱的，因此这些措施是不能用国防利益的理由来解释的，美国报章杂志最近所大事宣传的，是无限制的扩张，建立世界战略基地的计划，是这种“进攻精神”的明显解释。美国报纸不仅不谈到军事工业的复员计划，反而叫起了军事工业的动员。所有这些事实与美国出席联合国的首席代表奥斯丁的声明是不协调的，奥斯丁曾说：世界上没有一个国家比美国更忠于裁军事业。不顾严重的经济困难，英国保有的陆军，仍超过百万人，英国男子仍有百分之十五在军队中服务，在战事结束以后的一、二年中，英国的军事预算亦大形增加，英国议会刻亦讨论普遍兵役法案，这就是美英代表在联合国中声明效忠裁军事业的背景。
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷发表亚历舍耶夫关于普遍裁减军备之论文略称：自联合国大会通过关于普遍调整及裁减军备原则之决议以来，除安理会设有普通军备委员会外，迄今在决议履行方面并无进展。安理会规定普通军备委员会于三个月内呈交有关普遍调整及裁减军备措施之具体计划，此期限已在五月十二日截止。该委员会并没有完成这种指示，其工作则局限于空泛地讨论与普遍裁减军备有关问题，而不能使联合国更接近于履行联大所提出的任务。例如，英国代表贾德干就把普遍裁减军备的整个问题搅乱了。贾德干争辩说：尽管普遍裁减军备之计划顺利及完全的拟定出来了，但是，在国际信任还未确立以前，计划就不能履行。然而，准备实行裁减军备之措施，正是国际信任的一种征象。美国代表约翰生也采取了与英国代表完全相同之态度。他把普遍裁减军备之论点弄得更复杂化了。英美两国在普通军备委员会的代表之发言，均证明着这个结论，即彼等努力之目的不在于及早履行联大之决议，反而在于延宕决议之实现。该文结语称：和平与安全的利益，要求普通军备委员会，正确地遵照联大之决议，迅速完成制定普遍调整及裁减军备之具体实施计划。
