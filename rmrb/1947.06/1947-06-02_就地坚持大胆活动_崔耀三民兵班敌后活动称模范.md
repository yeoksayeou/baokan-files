　　Persist in Bold Activities On the Spot
    Cui Yaosan Militia Platoon Lauded as Model for Activities Behind Enemy Lines
    [This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, dated 31st] "Cui Yaosan Militia Platoon" has become a model for militia persisting in struggle on the spot. Cui Yaosan is the platoon leader of a militia platoon in a certain district of Wenshang. There are three or four brothers of Comrade Yaosan in the platoon. People call them the brothers' platoon. Comrade Yaosan was a mass leader in the local land reform. People within a dozen miles or so were familiar with his name. When the enemy's 5th Army, 72nd Division, and 85th Division invaded the east, he shouldered his gun and led the militia to heroically and tenaciously persist in the work in this area. In particular, when the traitor Gao Tingfu set up a temporary stronghold at Yuankou and looted wildly, he became even braver in defending the rural position. He fought twice in three days, cooperated with the large unit, and fully played the role of a scout and outpost for the small unit. His prestige was even higher, and he also became a thorn in the side of the enemy. The traitor Gao Tingfu tried several times to eliminate him, but all failed. On the contrary, he used sparrow warfare and once knocked down two enemy soldiers. Another time, when the enemy surrounded them, some comrades in the platoon wanted to disperse and hide, and some wanted to secretly bury their guns, but he bravely and firmly proposed: "With guns, there is life. Those who don't want to bury their guns, follow me." As a result, many timid people became bolder, and those who wanted to bury their guns did not bury them. As a result, his platoon's counter-"encirclement" was a complete victory, without any casualties. Their activities are very alert and flexible, and they can boldly attack the enemy, using the favorable conditions of being familiar with the land and the people to persist in that area. Yaosan Platoon has become a model among the militia in the continuous battles with the enemy.

　　就地坚持大胆活动
    崔耀三民兵班敌后活动称模范
    【本报冀鲁豫三十一日电】“崔耀三民兵班”已成为就地坚持斗争的民兵模范。崔耀三是汶上某区一个民兵班的班长，班里有耀三同志的兄弟三四个，人们都称他们为兄弟班，耀三同志在土地改革中是当地的群众领袖，附近十几里地都熟悉他的名字，敌五军、七十二师、八十五师东犯时，他扛起枪来，带领了民兵英勇顽强地坚持本地区工作，特别是汉奸高廷符在袁口按临时据点时，疯狂抢掠，他便更加勇敢地守卫农村阵地，三天打了两次仗，配合了大队，充分的起了小部队的侦察前哨作用，他的威信更高了，而在敌人方面也成了眼中钉。汉奸高廷符几次想消灭他，但均扑了空，相反的他却用麻雀战，一次曾打倒敌人两名。又一次敌人合围来了，班里的同志有的想分散躲避，有的想秘密埋枪，但他勇敢坚定的提出：“有枪就有命，不愿埋枪的跟我来。”于是很多胆小的也胆大了，想埋枪的也不埋枪了，结果他班反“合围”是完全胜利了，一无伤亡。他们的活动是很机警灵活的，能大胆的向敌人进攻，运用了地熟人熟的有利条件坚持那块地区。耀三班与敌人连续的战斗中，已成为民兵中的模范。
