Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: The people along the Hai (An) Tai (Zhou) line in Central Jiangsu sing of their bravery like this:

Li Lanying came from a poor peasant family. She lost her father at the age of seven. Her mother remarried, and because she was a "stepdaughter," she suffered all kinds of humiliation. For eighteen years, she lived an "unworthy" life. After the New Fourth Army came, she finally turned over and was elected as the township women's resistance director and militia instructor. But two years ago, she was deceived by her family and married a rich peasant's idle son. During the land reform, she was the first to offer six mu of good land from her husband's family. Her exemplary actions won praise throughout the township. However, her parents-in-law hated her for this.

In July of last year, Jiangyan, an important town on the Hai-Tai line, was occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, and her hometown became a major thoroughfare for the Chiang Kai-shek troops coming and going from north to south. In order to protect the permanent liberation of the poor and women, Li Lanying resolutely joined the township's armed work team. Because of her wit and courage, she became a female hero famous on the Hai-Tai line in less than a month.

On November 23rd last year, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops from the Jiangyan Yunliang River attacked Lin Huang Township at dawn. When they were not far from Li Lanying, they shouted, "Don't move, don't move!" She calmly raised her Hubei-made rifle and fired a shot. A Chiang Kai-shek soldier's head stretched out, and his steel helmet was shot off. Another time, she led the armed work team to ambush at Linjia Field. When twenty-one Chiang Kai-shek "Self-Defense Force" members broke in, she shouted, "Charge!" The Self-Defense Force hurriedly set up machine guns to fight back. She cursed, "Living bandits, I (meaning we) will send you home!" While aiming her gun, she shot down the enemy's machine gunner. The "Self-Defense Force" members were so frightened that they even dropped the coffins they had looted. In total, during the sixty days of counter-"encirclement and suppression," she participated in 58 battles, killed or captured five enemies, and led more than 3,000 people in demolishing the Jiang (Yan) Zhang (Dian) highway three times. She armed herself with a brand-new small carbine seized from the Chiang Kai-shek troops. Li Lanying's wit and composure in times of crisis are astonishing. Once, thirty or forty "Self-Defense Force" members surrounded her. She quickly hid in a kitchen. There was only a bed and a haystack in the kitchen. She thought the bed was a large target, and the enemy would definitely search it, so she hid in the inconspicuous small haystack without any cover, pressing her gun under her body, preparing to fight when the enemy discovered her. However, the enemy searched twice and fired shots under the bed, but they did not find her. Instead, she picked up seven new bullets that the enemy had dropped during the search. When the enemy had not gone even half a li, Li Lanying chased after them again. The first test of the new bullets was no different from warning them: "Li Lanying is still here!"

A hero is bound to be combined with the masses. Once, a company of "Self-Defense Force" members attempted to attack Li Lanying and her armed work team. After moving only half a li, the masses sent her sixteen pieces of intelligence within a quarter of an hour. When the enemy rushed in, the armed work team members had already disappeared. Another time, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek troops had surrounded her on three sides. She hid in a cabinet in someone's house. When the enemy entered the village, all the people deliberately crowded to the north to look around. The Chiang Kai-shek troops asked, "Where did the Red Spear Woman General go?" The people said, "She has already rushed to the river and slipped to the north." The Chiang Kai-shek troops took a closer look at the riverbank and found a large wet patch on the north bank, so they hurried to chase to the north of the river. It turned out that the water patch on the north bank was deliberately made by the masses.

The Chiang Kai-shek troops in Jiangyan had no way to deal with this Red Spear Woman General, and issued a notice: "Killing Li Lanying will be rewarded with 500,000 legal tender, and capturing her alive will double the reward." They wanted to use this to buy off the masses, but it had no effect. The Chiang Kai-shek troops had to spread rumors saying, "Li Lanying has been captured." Hundreds of people rushed to the township government overnight to inquire. When they saw Li Lanying with her red spear still jumping around, they hugged her in unison, so surprised that they couldn't speak.

A ballad circulates on the Hai-Tai line: "When the local diehards (referring to local Chiang Kai-shek puppets) arrive, hearts tremble with fear; when Li Lanying arrives, people sleep peacefully." But when the people meet her, they all call her "Little Fellow," because everyone treats her like their own children. (Note: "Little Fellow" is a term of endearment used by parents for their children.)

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 10th: Li Lanying, the female hero of Jiang (Yan) Nan District in Tai County, Central Jiangsu, personally led the guerrillas in the May counter-"encirclement and suppression" campaign, fighting bravely despite illness, and repeatedly defeating the Chiang Kai-shek troops. One day, Li and seven others were mobilizing for counter-"encirclement and suppression" in Lin Huang Township when more than 100 members of the Chiang Kai-shek Taizhou County Security Team attacked from Jiangyan in three routes. Li led her troops to break through. When the enemy approached, she used her divine marksmanship to kill an enemy vanguard and safely transferred. She was resting due to illness, but still helped the township with its work while ill. Eight days later, when her illness had slightly improved, she resolutely returned to the team. Until around the 21st, she was surrounded by the enemy twice again, foiling the enemy and puppet forces' conspiracy to jointly attack.

　　红枪女将李兰英
    孙明
    【新华社华中十日电】苏中海（安）泰（州）线的人民，都这样歌颂她们的英勇。
    李兰英贫农出身，七岁丧父，母亲带她重嫁，人家因她是“拖油瓶”而百般凌辱，十八年来，一直过着“不名誉”的日子。新四军来后，她好容易翻了身，被选为乡妇抗主任和民兵指导员。但大前年又被家庭蒙骗，嫁给一个富农的不务正业的儿子，土地改革时，她首将婆家六亩好地托出来，她的模范行动，博得全乡称颂。但公婆却因此恨透了她。
    去年七月间，海泰线重镇姜堰被蒋军占领，她的家乡就成了蒋军南北来往的要道。为了保卫穷人和妇女永远翻身，李兰英毅然加入了乡的武工队，由于机智胆大，不到一个月，就成为名震海泰线的女英雄了。
    去年十一月二十三日，姜堰运粮河三百余蒋军，拂晓合击林黄乡，离李兰英不远时，大喊“不准动，不准动。”她却不慌不忙的举起那条湖北条子，砰的一枪，一个蒋军头一伸，钢盔被打了下来。又一次，她带武工队在林家野设伏，当二十一个蒋记“自卫队”员闯进来时，她大喊一声：“冲去！”自卫队慌忙架起机枪应战。她一面骂：“活土匪，我来（即我们）送你家！”一面举枪瞄准射倒敌人的机枪手。“自卫队”员吓得连抢来的大棺材都丢掉了。总计在反“清剿”六十天中，她共参加战斗五十八次，毙俘敌五人，并三次领导三千余群众破拆姜（堰）张（甸）公路。她把从蒋军手中缴来簇新的小马枪武装了自己。李兰英在危急时的机智与沉着是惊人的。一次，三四十个“自卫队”员将她包围。她敏捷的躲到一个灶间里去。灶间里仅有一张床和一个草堆。她想床的目标大，敌人一定要搜，于是反躲在毫无遮栏但不引人注意的小草堆里，把枪压在身下，准备敌发觉时冲杀，然而敌人搜了两次，且在床底打枪，均未搜到。她反拾到敌人在搜查时丢下的七颗新子弹。当敌人还没有走半里路时，李兰英又追上去了，新弹初试，无异警告他们：“李兰英还在此地！”
    英雄必然是与群众相结合的，有一次，一个连的“自卫队”员企图袭击李兰英和她的武工队，出动才半里路，群众在一刻钟内就送给她十六次情报。当敌人扑来时，武工队员们已经无影无踪了。有一次，三百多蒋军已经将其三面兜住，她躲在一个人家的柜子里。当敌人进入该庄时，所有的群众都故意拥到北面去张望。蒋军追问：“红枪女将那里去了？”群众说：“已经扑河溜到北面去了。”蒋军到河边仔细一看，果然河北岸上湿了一大块，赶忙向河北追去。原来河北的水块是群众故意拨的。
    姜堰蒋军对这红枪女将毫无办法，出了张通告：“击毙李兰英赏法币五十万元，生擒加倍。”想以此收买群众，但毫无效果。蒋军只好造谣说：“李兰英已经捉住了。”数百群众连夜赶到乡政府去探问，一看持红枪的李兰英仍在跳跳蹦蹦时，都一拥把她抱住，惊喜得说不出话来。
    在海泰线上流传着一句歌谣：“土顽（指土著蒋伪）一到心惊肉跳，李兰英一到太平睡觉。”但当人民遇着她时，又一律称她为“小伙”，因为大家把她当作自己子女一样看待的。（注：小伙是父母对子女亲密称呼。）
    【新华社华中十日电】苏中泰县姜（堰）南区女英雄李兰英，亲率游击队在五月反“会剿”中带病作战，屡败蒋军。某日李等七人于林黄乡动员反“清剿”，蒋记泰州县保安队百余人自姜堰分三路袭来，李率部突围，待敌迫近，她神枪毙敌前锋一名，安然转移，旅生病休养，仍带病帮助乡里工作。八天后，病稍愈，又毅然回队。迄二十一日左右，又两次被敌重围，使敌伪合击阴谋终成泡影。
