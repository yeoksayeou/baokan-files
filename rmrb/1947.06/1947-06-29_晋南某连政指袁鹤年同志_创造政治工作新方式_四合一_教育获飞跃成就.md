Comrade Yuan Henian, the political instructor of a certain company of the People's Liberation Army in southern Shanxi, has created a "recollection" and "four-in-one" political work method, which has enabled the company's political work to achieve leap-forward development and success. Before new recruits and liberated soldiers enlist, Political Instructor Yuan convenes a "recollection meeting" for all the company's soldiers, asking them to recall their feelings when they first enlisted and to review their strengths and weaknesses in the company now. Based on previous experiences, the characteristics of new recruits and liberated soldiers are summarized. New recruits: 1. Have a life and lifestyle incompatible with veteran soldiers. 2. Are afraid of seeing people quarrel, afraid of hearing people say different things, and afraid of veteran soldiers looking down on them. 3. Are homesick. Newly liberated soldiers: 1. Value emotions. 2. Cannot withstand criticism. 3. Are sensitive and most easily feel the benefits of the Eighth Route Army and envy the happy life of the people in the liberated areas. Based on these characteristics, a plan is drawn up to unite the newly arrived soldiers. After the new recruits and liberated soldiers arrive at the company, in addition to a warm welcome and reception, a "four-in-one" mass education is immediately carried out: (1) Veteran liberated soldiers introduce their ideological process from being liberated from the Chiang-Yan army to joining the Eighth Route Army. (2) Newly liberated soldiers introduce their experiences and observations in the KMT-controlled areas, their own experiences, and their feelings after arriving in the liberated areas. (3) New recruits introduce various democratic and happy aspects of life in the liberated areas. (4) Veteran soldiers introduce the glorious traditions and impressive battles of their squads. Through such "four-in-one" mass education, not only can the illusions of the liberated soldiers about the KMT-controlled areas be completely eliminated, but also their enthusiasm for loving the liberated areas can be enhanced, their fighting spirit can be improved, and the motivation of the new recruits can also be inspired. In addition to conducting this "four-in-one" education in meetings, all the soldiers in the company are mobilized to conduct individual talks. In addition, at the beginning and end of the "four-in-one" education, various typical soldiers give reports to the entire company, which has even greater effect.

　　晋南某连政指袁鹤年同志
    创造政治工作新方式
    “四合一”教育获飞跃成就
    【本报太岳二十七日电】晋南人民解放军某连政指袁鹤年创造了“回忆”和“四合一”的政治工作方式，使全连政治工作获得飞跃发展成就。在新战士及解放战士入伍前，袁政指即召开全连战士开“回忆会”，让战士回忆自己刚入伍时的心情，并检讨现在自己在连里的优缺点。根据历次经验，总结出新战士和解放战士的特点。新战士是：一、人生，生活作风与老战士格格不入。二、怕见人吵架，怕听人说二话，怕老战士看不起自己。三、想家。新解放战士是：一、重感情。二、经不起批评。三、感觉灵敏，最易感到八路军的恩惠，和羡慕解放区人民的幸福生活。根据这些特点订出团结新来战士的计划，新战士和解放战士到达连队后，除进行热烈的欢迎与招待外，紧接着就进行“四合一”的群众教育：（一）由老解放战士介绍自己从蒋阎军解放过来及参加八路军的思想过程。（二）由新解放战士介绍在蒋管区的见闻及自己的遭遇，和到解放区后的感触。（三）由新战士介绍解放区各种民主幸福生活。（四）由老战士介绍本班的光荣传统和漂亮战斗。经过这样“四合一”的群众教育，不仅可使解放战士对蒋管区的幻想完全消除，而且可以增高爱护解放区的热情，提高他们的斗志，还可以启发新战士的上进心。这种“四合一”教育除在会议进行外，并发动了全连战士进行个别交谈。此外在“四合一”教育进行始末，并由各种典型的战士给全连作报告，收效就更大。
