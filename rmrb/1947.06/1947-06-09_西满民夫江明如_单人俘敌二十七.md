　　Xinhua News Agency, Ximan, 6th: When the troops attacked the outskirts of Huaide City and the battle was raging, Keshan civilian laborer Jiang Mingru followed a comrade and approached an important enemy machine gun position. The enemy's firepower was fierce, they crawled on the ground, and taking advantage of the enemy's pause in firing to observe the situation, he took a grenade and jumped onto the top of the enemy's bunker, shouting, "Surrender your guns! You bastards! If you don't surrender, I'll blow you up!" The enemies inside surrendered their guns. One enemy tried to escape but was beaten and had his leg broken by him with a carrying pole. As a result, twenty-seven Chiang soldiers were captured, and six light machine guns and seventeen rifles were seized. When Jiang Mingru returned to his hometown, a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army sent him three submachine guns, ten American rifles, two Mauser pistols, and six boxes of ammunition. The political commissar accompanied him for more than a mile.

    单人俘敌二十七
    【新华社西满六日电】克山民夫江明如在部队攻入怀德城郊战争进行正激时，随着一个同志接近了敌人一个重要机枪阵地。敌人火力很猛，他们爬在地上，乘敌停止射击观察情况之际，他拿了一颗手榴弹，一个箭步跳到敌人地堡顶上，喊道：“缴枪！杂种造的，不缴枪我炸死你们！”里面敌人缴出枪来。有一个敌人想逃跑，被他用扁担打断了腿。结果俘虏了二十七个蒋军，缴获六挺轻机枪，十七支步枪。当江明如返乡时，民主联军某部送他三挺冲锋式，十支美国步枪，两把盒子，六箱子弹。政委送他一里多路。
