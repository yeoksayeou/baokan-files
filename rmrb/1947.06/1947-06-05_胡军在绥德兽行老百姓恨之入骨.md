Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: Suide News: According to preliminary statistics, in less than a week before and after Hu Zongnan's army invaded the Suide County in early May, they killed more than 40 residents in 150 villages, abducted more than 1,000 people (most of whom have now returned), killed and abducted more than 1,000 donkeys, horses, and cattle, and killed more than 2,000 sheep and all pigs and chickens. Wherever Hu's army went, most of the women were raped, and doors, windows, chests, cabinets, hoe handles, fodder, and everything else that could be burned were burned. Many villages have been burned to the point of being uninhabitable and are filled with the stench of pig and sheep intestines, bones, and blood. The areas that suffered the most severely were Peijiawan, Laojundian, and Tianzhuang Haojiaqiao. Not only were grain, bedding, silverware, and furniture looted, but also shoes, socks, knives, scissors, spoons, chopsticks, urinals, and smoking pipes. An old man in Miaogou Village was smoking when Hu's army snatched the pipe from his mouth. The extremely vicious Hu's army defecated in vinegar jars, mixed pig manure into sorghum, scattered the grain they could not take away in mountain gullies, mixed it in mud pits and manure piles, and burned or tore the clothes they could not carry into pieces. The bestial acts of rape committed by Hu's army even extended to the families of Hu's soldiers. The younger sister of He Hongdu, the regimental commander of a certain regiment of Hu's army in Laojundian, was gang-raped by four soldiers of Hu's army, and his second younger brother's wife was gang-raped by six or seven soldiers of Hu's army. The wife of Li Piwan, the independent battalion commander of the 6th Cavalry Division who defected to Hu's army, was gang-raped at her home in Peijiawan and has not been able to get up since. Ma Zhongxuan, a reactionary landlord in Shatanping, said to the masses: "Don't be afraid, our own National Army is here." But after the rich were robbed by Hu's army, he bitterly said: "What National Army, they are simply bandits." Hu's army's bestial acts have deepened the people's determination to fight. The young and strong men of Suide are now joining the regular army and guerrillas in large numbers, and the women are also saying: "We will stab the enemy to death with needles when they come again."

　　胡军在绥德兽行老百姓恨之入骨
    【新华社陕北三日电】绥德讯：据初步统计，胡宗南军五月初侵入绥德县境前后不到一星期，在一百五十个村庄中，即杀死居民四十余人，拉走千余人（现已逃回大半），杀死和拉走驴马牛一千余匹，杀死羊二千余和猪鸡全部。胡军所到之处，妇女大部被奸污，门窗、箱柜、锄头柄、草料和其他一切能烧着的东西，和被烧光。许多村庄已烧得不能住人，并充满了猪羊肠肚骨血的恶臭。受害最烈的地区是裴家湾、老君殿、田庄郝家桥一带地方，这些都不但粮食、被毡、银器、家具，而且鞋袜、刀剪、勺筷、尿盆、烟袋也都被抢光。庙沟村有一老汉正在吸烟，烟袋竟被胡军从嘴里抢去。穷凶极恶的胡军，在醋瓮里拉上大便，高粱里渗进猪粪，把带不走的粮食撒在山沟里，搅在泥坑里、粪堆里，带不了的衣服烧掉或撕成碎片。胡军强奸的兽行即胡军家属亦未能幸免，老君殿胡军某团长何洪笃之妹被四个胡军轮奸，其二弟媳被六、七个胡军轮奸。叛变投胡军的骑六师独立大队长李坯万之妻，在裴家湾家中被胡军轮奸，至今不能起来。沙滩坪反动地主马仲选，向群众说：“不要怕，自家国军来了。”但在财主被胡军抢光后，他才痛恨地说：“什么国军，简直是土匪。”胡军兽行加深了群众斗争的决心，绥德的青壮年现正纷纷加入正规军和游击队，女人们也说：“敌人再来时用针也要扎死他。”
