　　Launching a Fierce Offensive Against the KMT-Controlled Areas
    The Yuwan Su Liberates Linquan and Shenqiu
    Recaptures @ County Town Between Yongcheng and Boxian
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Yuwan Su People's Liberation Army launched a fierce offensive against the KMT-controlled areas, marching south to liberate the county towns of Linquan and Shenqiu. After recapturing Jieshou at dawn on the 19th, this unit continued its southward advance, crossing the Sha River at dusk on the same day and attacking Linquan County in northern Anhui. The enemy fled south in a panic, and we immediately recovered the city. We captured two light machine guns, over 50,000 rounds of ammunition, over 200 rifles, and over 5,000 hand grenades, with no casualties on our side. On the same night, another unit of the Yuwan Su People's Liberation Army attacked Shenqiu County Town on the border of Henan and Anhui. We liberated the city at 10:00 AM on the 20th. The majority of the defending enemy fled at the news, and we killed or wounded over 40 enemy soldiers and captured over 50, seizing 53 long and short guns. On the night of the 19th, another unit of the Yuwan Su People's Liberation Army attacked the @ County Town stronghold west of Yongcheng (Xuefeng). The enemy fled at the news, and the stronghold was immediately recovered by us, and all fortifications were completely destroyed. On the morning of the 20th, over a hundred members of the Yongcheng puppet security regiment advanced on our army in @ County Town, but were repulsed by us, and the enemy was completely routed, with 17 killed or wounded and over 20 captured, and one light machine gun and over 20 rifles were seized.
    This time, when our Yuwan Su People's Liberation Army launched a fierce offensive against the KMT-controlled areas, the masses were extremely excited wherever we went, and they all complained to us about the crimes of the KMT puppets, and followed us along the way, asking our army to provide relief. We have initially distributed 500,000 catties of grain for disaster relief, and the masses are jubilant. (Attached picture)
