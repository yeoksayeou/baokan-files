　　Overturned Military Dependents Face Production Difficulties
    Licheng Inspects Substitute Farming
    [This newspaper's Licheng dispatch] Licheng is inspecting the preferential treatment of military dependents through substitute farming and has discovered two incorrect ideas among the masses: (1) Now that the military dependents have been liberated and have land, houses, and livestock, they no longer need preferential treatment! (2) The higher authorities have proposed that the military dependents should work hard themselves, so we can ignore them. The existence of these two ideas has somewhat affected the substitute farming work during the spring plowing and sowing. For example, Dong Youlan, a martyr's dependent from the Kongjia brigade, wants to hand over the orchard land she was allocated to the village because she lacks labor and cannot afford to pay wages. Li Lianzhu, a military dependent from Taibei Village, wants to give up the one-third share of livestock he was allocated, saying, "My life is worse after liberation than before. Before, when I didn't have livestock, I enjoyed animal-powered substitute farming. Now, with a one-third share of an animal, I can't afford the fodder or the travel expenses for errands because there is no manpower." This shows that the labor shortage faced by military dependents after the liberation movement has not been resolved. On the contrary, some households feel the labor shortage even more acutely due to the addition of land. In order to solve the above problems, the leadership clearly stated: Military dependents should indeed strive for self-production, but substitute farming should still be emphasized for military dependents who truly lack labor. This is our obligation and one of the most important tasks to support the front lines. The land that military dependents are unable to cultivate themselves should be cultivated by fixed mutual aid teams under a responsibility system, and auxiliary labor from military dependents should be organized to participate in various sideline productions, implementing a large-scale exchange of labor with agriculture. The masses were guided to discuss: Why are military dependents unwilling to have land and livestock? Are there really no difficulties after liberation? The discussion revealed that everyone agreed: There are difficulties that cannot be solved. Wang Qiaohan, an old man in his fifties, said, "Who did we rely on to be liberated? Their children are shedding blood and sweat at the front, and we are unwilling to even do substitute farming! I will voluntarily do substitute farming on five mu of land for military dependents this year." Many villages are now gradually solving this problem. (Lü Duan)

　　翻身军属生产有困难
    黎城检查代耕
    【本报黎城讯】黎城检查优军代耕工作，发现群众有两种错误想法：（一）军属翻身后有了土地房屋，也有了牲口，不用再优待啦！（二）上级提出要军属们自己好好劳动，那咱就可以不管他了，这两种思想的存在，使春耕下种中的代耕工作，多少受了些影响，例如孔家峻烈属董有兰，因劳力缺乏出不起工资，就要把分到的果实地交给村上。台北村军属李连珠想把分的三分之一牲口交出不要，他说：“我翻身还不如不翻身时候好过，没有牲口时我还享受畜力代耕，现在三家伙分了一个牲口，因为没人手，既出不起草料，又帮不起出差的盘钱”，从这里可以说明翻身运动后军属劳力不足为困难，并没有得到解决，相反的某些户由于加了土地，更感到劳力缺乏的困难。为了解决上述问题，领导上明确提出：军属固应自己努力生产，但对真正没劳力军属仍应强调代耕，这是我们的义务，也是支援前线最主要工作之一，军属无力自耕之土地应采取固定互助组代耕户的责任制办法，予以代耕，并提出组织军属的辅助劳力参加各种副业生产，与农业实行大变工。引导群众讨论：军属为什么不愿意要土地、牲口？翻身后真的没有困难了吗？讨论结果大家都说：是有困难没法解决。五十多岁的老汉王乔汉说：“咱翻身是多亏谁？人家孩们在前方流血流汗，咱就连代耕代耕也不愿意啦！我今年自动给军属代耕五亩地”。现不少村均在陆续解决这一问题。（履端）
