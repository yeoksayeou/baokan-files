　　In Ji Lu County, the land reform movement combined with participation in the war over the past forty days has been swift and vigorous, breaking through forty villages (out of a total of 119 villages in the county). Thirty-five villages have preliminarily distributed land, and another twenty-eight villages are under consideration. Nineteen landlords have been liquidated, and 153 feudal rich peasants have been dealt with. More than 20,000 people have participated in the movement, recovering 70,805 mu of land, which has been distributed to 853 households of land-poor and landless peasants. To protect their gains, more than fifty peasants have joined the militia. The reasons for these achievements are: First, adhering to the principle of combining land reform with participation in the war. Experience has shown that land reform can be carried out during busy war participation. For example, in early May, when a large number of people in the Third District participated in the war, some cadres panicked and said, "There are not many people in the village, let's talk about it when they come back." At this time, the leadership proposed that the war is long-term, and land reform cannot wait. A few people do the work of a few people, and by persisting in this way, many combined methods have been created: 1. Sending cadres and activists who can propagandize to lead the war participation, holding large meetings during breaks to conduct current affairs and policy education, holding a total of seven meetings, with more than a thousand people participating before and after. Some laborers complained on the spot. 2. Running training classes in villages with few cadres and few people, and absorbing more women and elderly people to participate. The Second District trained four times, training a total of 420 people, most of whom were elderly people and women. After training and complaining, they can play a significant role in the movement. The Third District broke through the struggle in sixteen villages during the war participation in January and seized the training class to cultivate backbones. Nearly a thousand people have been trained in the county. After the training, they are boldly used, and each person is given a task to make a plan for liberation. Third, using various large and small meetings to conduct in-depth and extensive publicity on policies and current affairs, such as victory celebration meetings, grievance redressal meetings, middle peasant meetings, militia meetings, military属meetings, unity meetings, and reconciliation meetings. This stabilized people's hearts, so that middle peasants were not afraid of being harmed, and poor and lower-middle peasants were not afraid of being prominent. Everyone united and was determined to fight against local bullies and landlords. Fourth, complaining, digging up the roots of poverty, and finding the roots of disaster are important methods for dispelling the masses' concerns, raising their awareness, and arousing hatred and fighting spirit. We must overcome the shortcomings of thinking that there is little suffering and being afraid of trouble, and only paying attention to individual complaints instead of organizing collective large-scale complaints. Fifth, to open up the situation and eliminate obstacles to land reform, it is necessary to support the masses and give them courage, detain war criminals, such as suppressing war criminals in the Third and Fourth Districts, destroying puppet and diehard institutions, and registering diehard and puppet personnel. This can reduce the masses' concerns. Sixth, in the new district, it is necessary to have a swift, vigorous, and bold spirit, especially in harsh environments. When complaining, pay attention to individual secret collusion, but when suppressing war criminals, concentrate forces and unite the struggle. This can show the powerful force of the masses and improve their confidence. Seventh, boldly use activists, use suffering to lead suffering, and once a typical example is found, it will be promoted throughout the district, exchanging experiences, without sticking to key points, but also without flying all over the sky.

　　稷麓四十日运动成绩大
    参战中组织斗争卅五村进行分田
    【本报太岳二十七日电】稷麓县四十天来结合参战进行土地改革，运动迅速猛烈，已突开了四十个村（全县共一一九村），有三十五村初步分配了土地，另有二十八个村正在酝酿，被清算地主十九人，封建富农一五三人，参加群众达二万余人，收回土地七零八零五亩，已分给八五三户少地无地农民，得地农民为保卫果实有五十余人参加民兵。造成这些成绩的原因：一、坚持参战中结合土改的方针，经验证明，在忙碌的参战中是能够进行土地改革的，如三区在五月初头群众大批参战，当时有些干部便慌了手脚，说：“村中没多少人，将来回来再说。”这时领导上即提出战争是长期的，土地改革是不能等待的，有几个人做几个人工作，这样坚持下去，创造了许多结合办法：一、派能宣传的干部积极分子带领参战，在休息中开大会，进行时事和政策教育，共开大会七次，前后参加达千余人，有些民夫当场诉苦。二、在村里干部少群众少的情况下办训练班，多吸收妇女老年人参加，二区训练了四次，共训练了四二○人，大部为老年人和妇女，经训练诉苦后，能在运动中起很大作用。三区在一月参战过程中，突破十六个村的斗争，并抓紧了训练班培养骨干。全县训练了近千人，训练完，即大胆使用，各人回去都给予任务，作出翻身计划。三、利用各种大小会进行深入广泛的政策时事宣传，如祝捷会，被倒算会，中农会，民兵会，军属会，团结会，解疙瘩会等，这样就安定了人心，中农不怕伤害，贫雇农不怕突出，大家团结，一致决心斗争恶霸、地主。四、诉苦、挑穷根、找祸根，是解开群众顾虑提高觉悟、激起仇恨和斗志的重要方法，要克服认为苦少怕麻烦，只注意个别诉苦，不组织集体大诉苦的毛病。五、要打开局面，扫除土地改革中的阻碍，给群众撑腰壮胆，扣押战犯，如三区、四区的镇压战犯，摧毁伪顽机构，进行顽伪人员登记等，这就可减少群众顾虑。六、在新区要雷厉风行，轰轰烈烈，大刀阔斧的精神，特别环境恶劣的地方，更应如此，在诉苦时，要注意个别秘密串通，但在镇压战犯时，要集中力量联合斗争，如此可表现出群众力量的强大，提高群众的信心。七、大胆使用积极分子，以苦引苦，一发现典型，即推广全区，交流经验，不固守重点，但也不满天飞。
