Skillfully Utilize Local Drought Resistance Conditions
	Shimin: Advocating the Opening of Small Canals
	Wuyi: Vigorously Digging Earth Wells
[Report from this newspaper, Taiyue, 24th] The masses in the first, second, and sixth districts of Shimin are actively opening canals and digging wells to fight drought using steelyard levers. In the second district, the masses of Panhe, under the leadership of the old district chief, opened a canal, turning more than 50 mu of dry land into paddy fields. The entire district now has 53 canals and 128 water wells, and 23 steelyard levers can irrigate 1,076 mu of land. The Xue Huaizhu mutual aid group in Quzhuang Village, consisting of nine people, jointly opened a canal, putting in 34 workdays in two days, completing two canals capable of irrigating nine mu of land. Xue Jinzhu said, "Although the water is not abundant, as long as we can open a few more canals, we can irrigate more land." Under their influence, the masses in Fan'ao and Huicun also opened four canals, capable of irrigating eight mu of land. In the first district, Huaizhuang recently built two new canals and one steelyard lever. Together with the two old canals that were restored earlier, they can irrigate a total of 200 mu of land. Gaozhuang Village held a symposium of cadres and the masses on the third day of the third lunar month to discuss drought prevention work, breaking the reliance on heaven. Starting from the seventh day of the third lunar month, they used a total of 113 workdays to build a three-li-long canal and installed a steelyard lever, which can irrigate 27 mu of land. Influenced by the well-digging efforts of Wu Weihui Director Wang Bingde and two others, the masses in Poshan Village have launched a well-digging campaign. The bank has also helped with loans of 35,000 yuan, with plans to dig four wells. In the sixth district, Yangjiahe had a canal 60 years ago. This canal was originally built by the big landlord Yan Bingqing for growing opium. Several attempts to organize the masses to repair it in 1943 and 1944 were unsuccessful. After the district held a turnaround production meeting on April 11 this year, it was repaired on April 24 under the personal leadership of cadres Zhao Qingbao and Pei Yi, with the participation of primary school students and teachers. After five days of work, the entire canal, three li long, was restored, capable of irrigating 37 mu of land. The masses in Suzhuang repaired a small canal that could irrigate 30 mu, making it capable of irrigating 107 mu. The masses in Miaowan are also planning to open canals. The masses throughout the district are concentrating their efforts on opening canals to prevent drought.
[Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 24th] The masses in Wuyi and Yuanchao are helping each other to dig wells to prevent drought. In the third district of Wuyi, 140 earth wells were dug, and 1,129 mu were sown. In the fourth district, Wang Lvchan organized a well-digging mutual aid group, which dug three wells in one day. In Dongxiaoding Village, in the second district of Yuanchao, all 40 mutual aid groups used up the water from brick wells in three days during the rush to plant. The militia captain said, "The land near the wells has been planted, but the land farther away still needs to be planted." After everyone discussed it, they decided to dig earth wells. Two wells were dug for large plots of land, and one well was dug for small plots. In seven days, 68 wells were dug, yielding 40 loads of water, enough to plant 1.5 to 2 mu of land. A total of 354 mu of peanuts and 97 mu of cotton were planted in the village. The masses happily said, "With these wells dug, the seedlings are growing again. With seedlings and wells, we don't have to worry about it not raining."
