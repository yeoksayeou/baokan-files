Alert!
    Landlord's Daughter Murders Husband, Self-Defense Captain Narrowly Escapes
    [Report from this newspaper, Jilu豫, 28th] The daughter of a landlord attempted to assassinate her husband, a loyal servant of the people. Lü Cunwei, the self-defense captain of Lümiao Village, First District, Guancheng, was married five years ago by his parents to the daughter of Zhao Yufeng, a landlord in Beijie, in the city. During the land reform movement, Comrade Cunwei was consistently active, leading the masses in the struggle against landlords such as his uncle Lü Xi, winning the support of the masses. However, his wife, because her family was being struggled against, expressed dissatisfaction with Lü Cunwei, telling him not to lead the masses in struggle, and saying, "If you struggle against this one and that one, you'll get your head chopped off sooner or later!" Lü Cunwei completely ignored his wife's words. When Chiang's Fifth Army came, her father became a "Homecoming Legionnaire," leading the enemy to harass military families, investigate the residences of village cadres, and looting grain everywhere. After the district was liberated, the democratic government immediately arrested him, and after the masses poured out their grievances, he was executed by shooting. From then on, Lü Cunwei's wife became even more dissatisfied, and when sleeping at night, she asked her husband: "Do you know the gate of the Ma district chief? He killed my father, and I will definitely take revenge!" Although Lü Cunwei was aware of this, he was not vigilant enough. One day, his wife started a fight with him, fiercely attacking his testicles. Lü Cunwei immediately fainted and fell to the ground, but was discovered and rescued by others. Lü immediately declared for divorce, which was approved by the government. The woman returned to her mother's house. When the Women's Association of Beijie heard the news that she wanted to kill her husband, they held a struggle meeting and beat her severely.
