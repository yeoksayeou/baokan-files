　　Grain Crops Suffering from Lack of Rain, Difficult to Grow Evenly
　　＠City's Four Districts Call for Replanting
　　[Our Newspaper ＠City News] The four districts are inspecting the sowing situation and calling on the masses not to leave any land uncultivated, and to carry out replanting. After inspection, Huangnian and Anju villages alone have more than 190 mu of millet that has not grown fully. In the fields of various villages, due to the lack of rain this year, many missing seedlings have also been found during inspections. Some individual households prioritize secondary occupations over agriculture, fearing conscription and corvee labor, hiding outside to engage in transportation and sideline production without returning to cultivate the land, leaving it barren. After discovering this situation, the county and district immediately instructed all villages that if any grain crops are found to be not fully grown after inspection, they should be replanted immediately. The barren land should immediately be cultivated by mutual aid teams in the village on behalf of the owners, and the wages that the mutual aid team should receive should be paid according to the standards after the owners return.

　　田禾缺雨难出齐
    ＠城四区号召补种
    【本报＠城讯】四区检查下种，号召群众不荒寸土，开展补种。黄碾、安居两村经检查就有一百九十余亩谷未有出全。各村田禾，因今年缺雨，也检查出很多缺苗，有个别户重副轻农、怕支差，躲在外边光捣运输副业生产不回来种地，将地荒了。县、区发现此种情况后，立即指示各村，如检查出未有出全之田禾，应立即补种。荒芜了的土地，应立即让村里互助组代耕，等本人回来后，按互助组应出的工资照付。（兴福、洪太、武城、双喜、问正、贵忠）
