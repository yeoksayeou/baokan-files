Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. The growth and activity of the people's guerrillas have made the Chiang-Hu army, which occupies the isolated city of Yan'an, feel terrified and uneasy day and night. The guerrilla team led by Yao Anji, deputy mayor of the Yan'an Municipal People's Government, often appears in the Zao Yuan and Lanjia Ping areas, which are less than ten miles from Yan'an. In the past month, the team has fought eight times with captured American-made machine guns, killing and wounding some enemies, capturing more than 30 enemies, and seizing more than ten rifles. The seven blockhouses built by the Hu army in Gaoqiao Town were completely destroyed by the team within an hour. The guerrilla team led by labor hero Yang Buhao operates in Qiao'er Gou and Li Jia Yu areas, which are 30 miles northeast of Yan'an, and has killed and captured more than 30 Hu soldiers. A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army also presented the team with two machine guns. The Southern District Guerrilla Team captured five officers and soldiers of the Hu army artillery regiment who came to Suojia Cliff to search for fodder on the third day of the Hu army's invasion of Yan'an, and seized three guns and two horses. Soon, four plainclothes soldiers of the 240th Regiment of the 47th Brigade of the Hu army arrived at Nanyaozi and were all wiped out by the guerrillas. Since then, the Hu army has erected a five-foot-high barbed wire fence between Yangma Bay and Beima Jiawan in this river valley, and prohibited pedestrians from passing through. On April 20, the guerrillas passed through the highway outside the Berlinzi blockhouse, less than ten miles from Yan'an, and arrived near Wu Manyou's hometown. On the 27th, twelve cavalry reconnaissance soldiers of the 27th Division of the Hu army were ambushed by guerrillas near Zhao Zhuang, less than five miles from their own blockhouse. One was killed and four were captured alive. The guerrillas also seized six Czech-style rifles and carbines. In addition, in the Ganquan County Guerrilla Team, 90 miles south of Yan'an, from mid-March to late May, more than 120 Chiang-Hu soldiers have been killed and wounded, 39 have been captured alive, and 45 guns have been seized. Two cars were destroyed. The highway traffic from Yan'an to Tongguan is frequently attacked by the guerrilla team.

　　游击队出没延市郊
    胡军日夜惊恐
    【新华社陕北三日电】人民游击队的壮大活跃，使侵据延安孤城之蒋胡军日夜恐惧不安。由延安民主市政府副市长姚安吉率领的游击队，经常出没于延市近郊十里之枣园、蓝家坪一带。一月来该队以缴获之美式机枪作战八次，除毙伤外，俘敌三十除人，缴获步枪十余支。高桥镇胡军修筑之七个碉堡，被该队于一小时内彻底破毁。劳动英雄杨步浩率领的游击队，在延市东北三十里内之桥儿沟，李家渝一带活动，已毙俘胡军三十余名。人民解放军某部并以机枪两挺赠送该队。南区游击队当胡军侵入延安的第三天，即将到索家崖搜抢草料的胡军炮兵团副官士兵五人俘获，并缴了三支枪，两匹马。不久胡军四十七旅二四○团的四个便衣到了南窑子，又被游击队全部消灭。从此胡军在这条川的阳马湾与背马家湾之间架起五尺高的铁丝网，并禁止行人来往。四月二十日，游击队通过距延安不及十里的柏林子碉堡外公路，到了吴满有的家乡附近。二十七日，胡军二十七师骑兵搜索排十二人即在离自己碉堡不到五里的赵庄附近遭受游击队伏击，一名被打死，四名被活捉。游击队又缴捷克式步马枪六支。此外在延安南九十里的甘泉县游击队，从三月中旬至五月下旬已毙伤蒋胡军一百二十余名，生俘三十九名，缴枪四十五支。击毁汽车两辆。延安到同官的公路交通，经常遭受该游击队的袭击。
