　　Old and New Grievances Settled Together
    Bo'ai Liberated Area Launches Counter-Reckoning
    [Report from this newspaper, Bo'ai] In the newly restored villages south of the Bo'ai Daqing Road, a widespread counter-reckoning movement is underway. From April 20th to May 10th, within 20 days, 28 villages in the fourth and fifth districts have launched the movement. At the beginning of the movement, a forum was first held in the fourth district, attended by over 140 honest peasants from 17 villages. Under the slogan of "Settle Accounts and Avenge Grievances, Make a Clean Sweep of Old and New Debts," everyone's class hatred was ignited by exposing the crimes of the treacherous bullies in reversing the verdicts. A liberated peasant from Dongliangshi said: "The village bullies Zhang Wenwu and Zhang Zhentian, under the instigation of the special agent Wu Yongfu, last autumn robbed the crops of the villagers, some were reaped, some were burned, and all the fruits of struggle were forcibly taken back, forcing the masses to live in dire straits. The mother of a militiaman stubbornly refused to return the fruits, and she was killed by him. The baby in the pregnant woman’s belly was also pulled out, killing two lives with one blow. Today, only struggle can allow us to survive." Under his influence, people eagerly stepped forward to pour out their grievances. Then, a meeting of over 80 bullies was held, ordering them to return the fruits to the masses and acknowledge that the lands and properties struggled for were all reasonable and legal. Under the demand of the masses for a general reckoning of vengeance, the chief culprits of the counter-reckoning, Zhang Wenwu and Zhang Zhentian, were suppressed, and a portion of land and seven head of livestock were recovered. The bully Liu ×× and others from Nan Zhangru returned more than 30 land deeds and contracts to the masses and signed new contracts, promising to never demand them back and never reverse the verdicts. In the fifth district, the 11 villages have achieved great results through the counter-reckoning, with the villages of Bei Shijian and Suzuo alone recovering 128 mu of land, 26 rooms, and a large amount of furniture and grain. The masses of Zhangruji and Wugezhai have already started planting the land of the big bully and major traitor Wang Laoqi.

　　新仇旧恨一齐算
    博爱收复区开展反倒算
    【本报博爱讯】博爱道清路南广大新恢复村普遍开展反倒算运动。从四月二十日至五月十日二十天中，四、五两区廿八个村庄已开展了。运动开始，首先在四区召开了十七个村的一百四十余人老实农民座谈会，在“诉苦复仇总清算，新仇旧恨一齐报”的口号下，经过揭发奸霸倒算罪行，启发了大家的阶级仇恨。东良仕一个翻身农民说：“俺村恶霸张文武、张振田在特务吴永福的指使下，去秋将全村老百姓的庄稼，有的抢收了，有的焚烧了，把斗争果实全部强行要回去，逼的群众无法生活。一个民兵的母亲顽强坚决的不给他退果实，就被他杀害，并将孕妇肚里的小孩挑了出来，一害二命，今天只有斗争才能活下去。”在他的影响下，纷纷争相诉苦。接着又召开了八十余人的恶霸会议，让他们给群众退果实，并承认斗争过的土地财产，均是合理合法的，并在群众复仇总清算的要求下，镇压了倒算祸首张文武，张振田二人，收回土地一部，牲口七头。南张茹恶霸刘××等向群众退出地契文约三十余张，并另订新文约，永不再要，永不再倒算。五区十一个村经过反倒算成绩很大，仅北十涧与苏作两个村共收回土地一百二十八亩，房二十六间及家具粮食等甚多。张茹集、武阁寨群众将大恶霸大汉奸王老七的土地都已种起来了。
