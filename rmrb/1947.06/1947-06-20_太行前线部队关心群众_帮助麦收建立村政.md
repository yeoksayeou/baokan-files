　　Taihang Frontline Troops Care for the Masses
    Helping with Wheat Harvest and Establishing Village Governments

    [Our Newspaper] The Taihang Frontline troops, with a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other, are vigorously helping the masses in the newly liberated areas to harvest wheat and plant crops. The 30th Directly Subordinate Detachment, in Xiqugou village alone, mobilized 2,800 laborers in one week, tending to 750 mu of wheat fields, irrigating 180 mu, carrying 2,600 loads and 500 carts of manure, hoeing 45 mu, and carrying water to plant cotton on 31 mu. Many units gave up their afternoon naps, helping with the harvest during the day and rushing to work at night. From leaders to cooks and animal tenders, everyone joined the harvest assistance upsurge. In the Xiqugou area, because the enemy had buried landmines everywhere in the past, many people were bombed in the fields. The Special Task Company of our 30th Detachment risked their lives to remove the landmines, so the masses could harvest with peace of mind. In addition, our army, near its stationed areas, also helped the masses establish democratically elected village governments and mass organizations. For example, the 10th Detachment has helped establish nine village governments and is cooperating with local district offices to establish three. More than 300 men and 60 women in the area where the detachment is stationed have become organized masses. We also used some of the enemy and puppet assets we seized to relieve disaster victims. Under the influence of our work, the masses voluntarily reported enemy and puppet hidden weapons. The masses in the area where the 10th Detachment is stationed reported 12 long and short guns.

    [Our Newspaper] Our 40th Detachment, while protecting the wheat harvest on the Yubei front, repeatedly attacked the enemies harassing from Jixian County, shielding the wheat harvest in the border areas. On May 26, more than 100 Chiang Kai-shek army soldiers in plain clothes raided the area of Da and Xiao Sima (more than 10 li northwest of Jixian County) to steal wheat. The Second Company of our 401st Detachment encountered the enemy and immediately launched a counterattack. After two hours of fighting, the enemy, unable to withstand the assault, fled back. On June 1, the Third Squad of the 403rd Detachment ambushed Chiang Kai-shek’s grain-grabbing bandits at Qiaoshan, more than 30 li north of Xinxiang. At about 11:00 a.m., about 200 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers entered the ambush circle of the Third Squad. Rifles and hand grenades opened fire simultaneously, immediately killing and wounding more than 20 enemies. The enemy fled in a panic with injuries. During the lulls in the fighting, they helped the masses harvest more than 2,000 mu of wheat, and most of it was carried to the threshing ground. Some also helped the villagers with threshing, greatly improving the relationship between the army and the people. (Xiaofeng)

　　太行前线部队关心群众
    帮助麦收建立村政
    【本报讯】太行前线部队一手拿枪一手拿镰，大力帮助新区群众收麦下种。三○直属队，仅在西曲沟一村，一周内即出动二千八百个劳力，小麦田七百五十亩，浇地一百八十亩，担粪二千六百担又五百车，锄地四十五亩，担水种棉三十一亩。不少单位都放弃了午睡，白天助收、晚上还赶工作。无论首长至炊事员、饲养员，都卷入助收热潮。在西曲沟一带因过去敌人到处埋地雷，群众在田里被炸者不少，我三○部特务连即冒险起出地雷，群众才放心收割。此外，我军在驻地附近，还帮助群众建立民选的村政权及群众组织，如一○部已帮助建立九个村政权，并协同地方区署建立三个。该部驻地三百多男子、六十多妇女已成有组织群众。我并将部分缴获敌伪资财救济灾民。在我工作影响下，群众自动报出敌伪掩藏的武器，一○部驻地群众即报出长短枪支十二枝。
    【本报讯】我四零部队在豫北前线保卫麦收中，迭次打击了汲县出扰之敌人，掩护了边地的收麦。五月二十六日，蒋军便衣队百余向大小司马（汲县西北十余里）一带抢麦，我四○一部二连适与敌遭遇，当即向敌阻击，经两小时战斗，敌不支窜回。六月一日，四○三部三小队在新乡以北三十余里之翘山，伏击蒋家抢粮喽＠，上午十一时许，约二百余蒋军进入三小队预伏圈内后，步枪、手榴弹同时开火，当即毙伤敌二十余，敌负创狼狈窜去。战斗空隙共帮助群众收麦二千余亩，并且大部分担运到场里，有的还帮助老乡打场，军民关系大大的改善了。（晓峰）
