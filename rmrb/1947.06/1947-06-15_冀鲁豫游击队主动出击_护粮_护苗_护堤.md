[This newspaper Jilu Yu 12th electric] Jilu Yu behind enemy lines guerrillas actively fighting, fully protect food to help harvest. Around May 30, the wheat in Yunju county was ripe, and the enemy in Yuncheng and Heze and various puppet district departments transferred troops to rob wheat in the guerrilla base areas of Yun, Ju, 1, 3, 4, and 5 districts. On May 27, Yang, the district chief of our first district, led the militia to go deep behind enemy lines to the Xinji area to attack the wheat-grabbing enemy, killing three members of the "Homecoming Corps" with three shots and obtaining two guns, preventing the puppet district department from going out to rob wheat. At 8 a.m. the next morning, the puppet captain Wu Mazi's troops, together with two companies from the puppet commissioner's office, advanced to the Anxingji area to rob wheat. Our guerrillas helped with the wheat harvest on one hand, and attacked the wheat-grabbing enemy in Changtun on the other. The enemy suffered 12 casualties and collapsed. On June 2, after our County Chief Hao led the armed forces to repel the wheat-grabbing Chiang Kai-shek troops, they transferred to Shizhuang in the evening and immediately investigated the families of soldiers and martyrs and households without labor, in order to help with the wheat harvest. On the 3rd, County Chief Hao led his troops to help with the harvest, and when they returned to the village at dusk, they were warmly welcomed by the masses. On May 30, the first battalion of the seventh sub-district repelled the enemy from Wenshang who came to rob wheat, killing and wounding 19 enemies, and the people's grain was not damaged. After returning from the battle, the soldiers put down their guns and immediately picked up their sickles to actively help the masses harvest. Also, on May 15, two battalions of the 74th Brigade of the Yuncheng enemy, in cooperation with the "Homecoming Corps," numbering about 700, came to the 5th district of Yunju to rob grain. Our Yunju County Brigade resisted them. On the 17th, the puppet district captain led more than 200 people to the Zhang Lizhuang area of our South Sub-district to rob grain. As soon as the four-wheeled carts were loaded with grain, they were surrounded by our militia. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated. We took advantage of the victory to pursue them to Xia Yinji. Sharpshooter Wang Da fired five shots and killed four enemies. The enemy retreated in panic, and we pursued them again to the village of Sun Gu Dui. The masses scrambled to boil water, send tea, and send cigarettes to comfort us. In this battle, the enemy suffered eight serious injuries, two minor injuries, and four deaths, and we also recovered four large carts of grain and returned them to the masses.

[This newspaper Jilu Yu 13th electric] Because our guerrillas ambushed and attacked the enemy day and night, the Chiang Kai-shek troops south of the Yellow River were extremely panicked, and the highway traffic on hundreds of miles of Heji, Yunju, and Yuancheng was frequently cut off by us. At present, sorghum seedlings have generally emerged, and the green gauze tents are about to rise. The enemy is even more panicked, ordering the first district of Kaocheng to pull out all the sorghum seedlings within three days. The masses resisted and refused to comply, and the enemy used shovels to destroy all the seedlings. In the seventh district of Yuancheng, the enemy forced the masses to pull out the seedlings, and the masses passively resisted. When the enemy discovered this, they arrested the masses everywhere and inflicted extreme punishments on the grounds of "disobeying orders." In the fifth district of Yuancheng, due to the long drought, sorghum was sown after the spring equinox, but the seedlings were destroyed by the Chiang Kai-shek troops as soon as they emerged. The people south of the Yellow River telegraphed the whole country in tears, demanding that the beasts of the Chiang Kai-shek army be punished for this atrocity, and solemnly telegraphed the People's Liberation Army, demanding that it annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek army on a larger scale to avenge the people. Our local guerrillas have launched a struggle to protect the seedlings.

[This newspaper Jilu Yu 12th electric] The Chiang Kai-shek troops who invaded the south bank of the Yellow River to break the dikes and dig for danger were severely attacked by the river defense militia of Hexi County. They removed 31 blockhouses in one fell swoop. The Chiang Kai-shek troops attempted to completely destroy the dikes by setting up strongholds along the south bank of the river, digging ditches or shelters on the dikes, and doing everything they could to destroy them. They also frequently shelled and strafed our workers who were rushing to protect the dikes. The masses in Hexi County, unable to bear it any longer, rose up to establish river defenses. On May 19, the fourth battalion of the county's river defense militia took the initiative to cross the river and attack, sweeping the enemy's strongholds along the river and removing 31 blockhouses in one fell swoop. The Chiang Kai-shek troops fled in panic, and our river defense militia took advantage of the victory to pursue and mop up the remnants of the enemy, and joined forces under the city of Pingyin before victoriously transferring in the evening.
