Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to TASS, Budapest: The Hungarian Parliament recently held a special session. The President of the Republic sent a letter to the assembly announcing the appointment of Dienes as Prime Minister. Dienes' declaration regarding his acceptance of the premiership and organization of the new cabinet, as well as the list of new cabinet members, were read out. Dienes and the new cabinet members attended the parliament. In announcing the new government's policy program, Dienes sternly condemned foreign rumors and slander against Hungary, and stated: "The Smallholders Party has expelled the traitors Nagy and Varga from the party with feelings of hatred." Deputy Kuba, representing the Smallholders Party, stated: "Nagy and Varga colluded with the enemies of the Hungarian Republic. They are guilty of treason. Our party is determined to cleanse this stain and cooperate sincerely with the Workers' Party and the Peasants' Party."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to TASS, Budapest: At a press conference with domestic and foreign journalists, the new Hungarian Prime Minister Dienes sternly refuted rumors spread by foreign newspapers, such as the so-called unrest in Hungary and the so-called Communist Party instigation. He said: "Our workers, peasants, and professionals are now busy with their work, and they will not allow absurd rumors and slanders to hinder their work. The democratic forces in Hungary are now strong, and they will ruthlessly suppress those who conspire against democracy." Dienes advocated establishing friendly relations with neighboring countries, all democratic nations, and powerful nations such as Britain and the United States, especially with the Soviet Union. In answering reporters' questions, Dienes described how Nagy established his personal dictatorship within the party (note: the Smallholders Party), creating constant conflicts within the coalition government, disregarding the domestic situation and national interests, and wrongly leading the party and the country. Dienes pointed out: In the past, there were two lines within the party: one faction defended the coalition government and worked for the interests of the peasants, while a minority of leaders actually controlled everything and pursued adventurous policies. Regarding the rumor that Nagy was forced to resign, Dienes refuted it, saying: "Using the telephone to exert coercion is a new and sensational fabrication." Dienes declared: Regarding reasons for foreign and domestic policies, he believes elections are necessary. Dienes concluded by declaring: Those who are unwilling to work together with the Hungarian people are free to leave. The government will never tolerate any trickery or any treasonous conspiracies.

    【新华社陕北十四日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利国会顷举行特别会议。共和国总统致函该会宣布任命丁尼斯为总理。丁尼斯关于受命任总理并组织新阁的宣言及新阁员名单均经宣读。丁尼斯及新阁员均出席议会。丁氏在宣布新政府的施政方针时，严斥外国对匈牙利的造谣与诽谤，并称：小地主党已以痛恨的心情将卖国的奈基与法尔加开除出党。议员顾巴代表小地主党发言说：“奈基和法尔加与匈牙利共和国的敌人勾结，他们是叛国的罪犯，本党决定清洗这一污点，和工人政党与农民党竭诚合作。”
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：在国内外记者招待会上，匈新总理丁尼斯严厉驳斥外国报纸所传播的谣言，如所谓匈牙利发生骚动，所谓匈共党推波助澜等。他说：我国的工人农民和各种职业者现正忙于工作，他们不容许在工作中有荒谬的谣言与诽谤所阻扰。匈牙利的民主力量现在是强大的，他将无情地镇压那些阴谋反对民主的家伙们。丁氏做调对邻国、一切民主国家及英美等强国，特别是和苏联建立友好邦交。丁氏在答复记者时叙述奈基怎样建立他个人的党（按：小地主党）内的独裁，制造联合政府的经常冲突，而不顾国内情况和国家的利益，错误地领导着党和国家。丁氏指出：过去该党存在着两条路线：一派保卫联合政府，为农民利益而努力，另一派少数的领袖们实际上控制了一切，进行冒险的政策。对于奈基被迫辞职的谣言，丁尼斯驳斥称：用电话施行强迫，倒是一件新的动人听闻的杜撰。丁尼斯宣称：有关外交内政政策的理由，他认为选举是必要的。丁尼斯在结语中宣称：那些不愿与匈牙利人民共同工作的人们，可以自由地走开，政府决不容忍任何的诡计和任何的叛国阴谋。
