　　Resist Chiang Kai-shek's Troops' Grain Seizure and Conscription: Guerrilla Warfare Unfolds in Qi County
    [Our Newspaper Qi County News] Each district in Qi County has shifted from mobilizing the masses to speak out about their suffering and vengeance, and to denounce and liquidate traitors, to organizing militias and armed work teams, universally launching guerrilla warfare. Since May 16th, not a day has passed without fighting the enemy. On May 20th, our Second District Office and the district cadre team were surrounded, and we engaged in a two-hour life-or-death battle to break through. We suffered no casualties, while the enemy suffered two dead and two wounded.

    The enemy has established strongholds in Gao Village and Sidepu, about twenty *li* away from the county seat. The masses generally reflected, "We are afraid that the Eighth Route Army will leave again, and the Kuomintang troops will come again!" In response to this sense of disappointment among the masses, cadres from the Third and Fifth Districts, in conjunction with the armed work teams, continuously went to Chen Village area (more than five *li* away from Gao Village) near the enemy strongholds to publicize news of victories and express our attitude: We will never leave Qi County! We also discussed with the masses the organization of struggles against conscription and grain requisition.

    The weapons and clothing of the 85th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops stationed in Gao Village and Sidepu are very disordered (many are in plain clothes), and they loot and rape in every village they go to. This can be seen from a folk rhyme circulating among the people: "The Kuomintang troops, when they arrive in a village, first catch chickens, then demand eggs, cut down all the trees, large and small, empty out all the grain, rice, flour, and oil, young women are raped, and men's new shoes are all taken, taking all the clothes they can wear." On the 20th of this month, the enemy went to Sidepu and raped seventeen young women in one night (including the daughter-in-law of a landlord who welcomed the puppet and die-hard troops). In order to cover up their scandals, the enemy confused the masses by saying, "The raped women are all female workers of the Eighth Route Army." The masses were afraid to speak out, unable to express their grievances, and had to swallow their pain in silence.

    On the 26th, Chiang Kai-shek's troops set out from Gao Village in three routes to eight villages including Sanlitun, Da Xiaohua Village, and Cheng Village, ransacking houses and stealing rice and flour. An old man in Wei Village had just cooked ten *jin* of sesame oil, still hot, which was also taken away, even a small oil can. The head of Xiaohua Village, Duan Xiaoqun, diligently entertained them, but because he was preparing to cut wheat and was wearing a pair of new shoes, Chiang Kai-shek's troops took a fancy to them, slapped him twice, and kicked off a pair of new shoes he had prepared to wear when cutting wheat in May. Every time the people of Qi County meet one of our comrades, they warmly complain to us. In order to resist the enemy's plunder and thwart their grain requisition plan, we mobilized and organized all the armed forces in all six districts of the county to launch a full-scale attack on the enemy in Gao Village and Sidepu. The enemy panicked and frantically fired at us, not sleeping all night. The next day, they split into two routes to retaliate against us, one towards the Miaokou area and the other towards the Da Lizhuang area. In every village they went to, bullets from the armed work teams and militia greeted them. Our Sixth District Armed Work Team repelled several enemy charges on the Houpo Mountain west of Da Lizhuang Village, killing three enemy platoon leaders and wounding two. On the 26th and 27th, we exchanged more than one hundred rounds of ammunition for more than forty enemy artillery shells and countless rifle and machine gun bullets, achieving the goal of exhausting and tiring the enemy, breaking the enemy's plan to loot and conscript, and the guerrilla war in Qi County is now developing vigorously.

　　反抗蒋军抢粮抓丁淇县展开游击战争
    【本报淇县讯】淇县各区部由发动群众诉苦复仇反奸清算转向组织民兵与武工队，普遍开展游击战争。从五月十六日起，便没有一天不在和敌人打仗了。五月二十日我二区公所及区干队被包围了，展开了突围的生死战斗二小时，我无伤亡，敌死二伤二。
    敌人在离县城二十来里地的高村思德铺打了钉子，群众普遍的反映是：“怕八路军又走了，怕遭殃军来又来了！”针对群众这种失望思想，三、五区干部结合武工队便不断到敌据点附近陈庄一带（离高村五里多地）宣传胜利消息，表明我们态度：我们绝不会离开淇县！并和群众商量组织抗夫抗粮斗争。
    驻高村思德铺的蒋军八十五师武器服装非常杂乱（便衣不少），每到一村便抢掠奸淫。从民间流行的一个歌谣里可以看出：“遭殃军，到一村，先捉鸡，后要蛋，大树小树砍个遍，麦米面油倒个干，青年妇女被强奸，男人新鞋一律换，见了能穿的衣服都拿完。”本月二十日敌人到思德铺，一夜就强奸了青年妇女十七人（其中有欢迎伪顽军的地主儿媳）。敌人为了掩护自己丑事，迷糊群众说：“奸淫的妇女都是八路军的女工作员。”群众有气不敢说，有苦不能诉，只好哑吧吃黄连，内心忍痛。
    二十六日蒋军从高村分三路出发到三里屯、大小花庄、程庄等八个村挨户翻箱倒柜抢米倒面，抢掠一空。未庄一个老乡刚熬好了十斤麻油还热腾腾的也被倒走，连一个小油罐也拿走。小花庄保长段小群殷勤的招待着它们，可是自己因为准备割麦子，穿上一对新鞋，被蒋军看中了，也挨了两巴掌，又一脚把一对准备过五月割麦子时穿的一对新鞋也脱走了。淇县老百姓每碰见我们一个同志便很亲热的向我们诉苦。为了反抗敌人的掠夺，打破敌人的抢粮计划，发动组织全县六个区所有武装全面出动，分向高村思德铺敌人袭击。敌人惊慌得疯狂向我扫射，一夜没有睡觉。第二天分二路向我报复，一路向庙口一带，一路向大李庄一带。敌人每到一村，都有武工队民兵的子弹叫他吃。我六区武工队在大李庄村西的后坡山上几次击退敌人冲锋，计打死敌排长三名，打伤二名。二十六、七两天我以一百多发子弹换得敌大炮弹四十多发，步机枪子弹无数，达到消耗与疲劳敌人的目的，打破了敌人抢掠抓夫计划，现淇县游击战争正在猛烈开展中。（仁杰、泽生）
