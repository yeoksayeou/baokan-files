Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, Shanghai, 17th: A Pravda reporter reported that the Shanghai press is paying close attention to the statement made by the US State Department spokesperson regarding the provocative report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency about the Kuomintang army's invasion of the border of the Mongolian People's Republic. The following fact is particularly noteworthy: the US State Department spokesperson's statement closely followed the Central News Agency's publication of the aforementioned report. The Central News Agency reversed the facts, saying that the incident occurred in Chinese territory 200 miles from the border of the Mongolian People's Republic. The US State Department spokesperson said that regarding this matter, he only used information from the US Consul in Dihua, Xinjiang, and he confirmed that the information from the US Consul was consistent with the Central News Agency's report. These reports have led people to believe that the US Consul in Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province, is in agreement with the Central News Agency's report regarding the Beitashan area incident within the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. According to people from Xinjiang who have come to Shanghai, US Consul Paxton has been paying particular attention to the border areas of northeastern Xinjiang, bordering the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic, and China, for several months. It is said that in April, under the instructions of US Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower, he, along with his driver Irvine (who is from the local German population), traveled in this area, taking photos of the border area, paying close attention to local characteristics and other information. This situation, along with the US State Department spokesperson's statement, has provided a basis for rumors among Shanghai social circles. They say that, according to Eisenhower's instructions, the US Consul in Dihua participated in the preparation and organization of the Mongolian People's Republic border incident. This incident occurred on June 5th between the Mongolian border guard troops and the Kuomintang army that invaded the border of the Mongolian People's Republic to provoke the incident.

　　美国驻迪化领事派克斯敦
    幕后策动北塔山事件
    国务院附和中央社颠倒黑白
    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社上海十七日电：真理报记者报导，上海报界对美国国务院发言人就国民党中央社对国民党军队侵犯蒙古人民共和国边境的挑拨性报导所作声明，均加以锐敏的注视。下列事实特别引人注意，即国务院发言人声明，恰恰紧跟在中央社发表上面所说的报导之后。该中央社颠倒事实，说事件发生在距离蒙古人民共和国边境二百英里的中国境内。美国国务院发言人说，关于此事，他仅仅利用来自美国驻新疆领事之情报，他并证实美国领事的情报与中央社报导相一致。这些报导已使人相信，美国驻新疆省会迪化的领事，是附和中央社关于蒙古人民共和国境内北塔山地区事件的报导的。据新疆来沪人谈，美国领事派克斯敦几个月来对新疆东北部苏联，蒙古人民共和国与中国边境地区，表示特别注意。据说四月间他奉美国陆军参谋总长艾森豪威尔之指示，偕同他的车夫伊尔文（此人系来自当地德国人中）在这个地区旅行，拍制边境区域的照片，对地方特点及其他情报甚为注意。这种情况和国务院发言人的声明倒给上海社会人士的传言提供了根据。他们传说，遵照艾森豪威尔的指示，美国驻迪化领事曾参与了蒙古人民共和国边境事件的准备与组织的。这个事件就于六月五日发生在蒙古边境守卫部队与侵犯蒙古人民共和国边境以挑起事件的国民党军队之间。
