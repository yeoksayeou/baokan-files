Taihang News: The Second Administrative District is organizing a medical team to alleviate the suffering of the masses in the border counties from epidemics and diseases. The Administrative Office has organized a medical team of more than 20 Chinese and Western doctors, carrying a large number of medicines for scabies, typhoid, malaria, cholera, influenza, and other diseases, to go to Qianding, Yuci, Taigu, Shouyang, Qixian and other border areas for diagnosis and treatment. The doctors participating in the team include famous doctors from Jindong Hospital, Zuoquan Hospital, and Heshun, Xiyang, Yushe, Wuxiang and other places, divided into five groups. The working time is temporarily set for one month. After arrival, they will cooperate with the doctors from the county hospitals and medical cooperatives to allocate forces and medicines according to the local epidemic situation and implement zonal and weekly diagnosis and treatment. Special care should be given to military martyrs, dependents, and demobilized soldiers, helping districts and villages establish medical cooperatives, conduct health and epidemic prevention publicity, and carry out social health campaigns. The medical team departed successively before the 5th of this month.

Also reported: Since Commissioner Fan put forward the call for the hinterland to support the border areas, Yushe, Zuoquan, Heshun, Xiangyuan, the Second Branch of the Bank, and the Administrative Office's Wenhua Printing Factory and other institutions and schools have responded enthusiastically and launched a widespread fundraising campaign. Currently, more than 200 piculs of millet and miscellaneous grains and nearly 2 million yuan in silver dollars have been raised. Fundraising is still continuing in various places. The Civil Affairs Section of the Administrative Office is organizing plans to quickly distribute the first batch of donated materials according to the disaster situation in each county.
