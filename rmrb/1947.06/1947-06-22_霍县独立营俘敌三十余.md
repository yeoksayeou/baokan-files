　　Huo County Independent Battalion Captures Over Thirty Enemies
    [Our Newspaper, Huo County Dispatch] On May 20th, a company of Yan's puppet troops, setting out from Lingshi, harassed the vicinity of Ma Liang (under the jurisdiction of Fenxi), attempting to seize grain. Upon hearing the news, our county battalion troops immediately organized and departed, pursuing from Fengzitan (under the jurisdiction of Fenxi) to the vicinity of Qicun (under the jurisdiction of Zhaocheng). After a fierce attack by our forces, the enemy was in a state of utter disarray, and fled back to Fengzitan. Yang Shengxi, the enemy platoon leader, submitted a letter of surrender to our brigade, requesting to lay down their arms. Coincidentally, the surrender letter was obtained by the working team of our neighboring friendly district, who immediately cooperated in the operation. Except for the company commander who escaped with only one person, the rest surrendered their weapons entirely, totaling the capture of thirty-three enemy soldiers, including the platoon leader and below, along with the seizure of four small cannons, three light machine guns, seventeen rifles, over a thousand rounds of ammunition, and seven artillery shells.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 19th Dispatch] From January to May, the working teams of Hongdong, Linfen, Xiangling, and Quwo counties fought a total of seventy-one battles, killing, wounding, and capturing four hundred and twenty enemy soldiers; convened over a hundred meetings of various types in the Chiang-Yan areas, distributed eight thousand propaganda materials, won over ninety-four stubborn families, and disintegrated ninety-eight puppet soldiers; seized five machine guns, one hundred and twenty-three long and short guns, one thousand three hundred rounds of ammunition, seventeen mules and horses, six telephones, four thousand four hundred and twenty catties of grain, 1.5 million legal currency, and four thousand catties of salt. At the same time, twenty-five democratic district village governments were established and coordinated to participate in the mass work of three villages.
