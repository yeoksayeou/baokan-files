　　Du Yunyue's Soldiers' Club
Editor's note: This article was written by the Political Department of the Ninth Sub-district of Southern Hebei. Comrade Du Yunyue is the cultural officer of the Fourth Company of the Independent Regiment and was elected as a second-class work model at the Heroes' Congress. We are publishing this article here for the reference of cultural workers in the army.

　I. Old Methods Hit a Snag
　　Last spring, after Comrade Du Yunyue established the club, he also organized the house, wrote slogans, drew cartoons, and set up various columns. At first, the soldiers felt it was very novel. They wrote notes and asked questions in the Q&A column. Some, for the sake of revenge, would ask questions in return. As a result, the Q&A column was active for more than twenty days. However, because the club members were not responsible enough, some questions were not answered. Everyone felt it was no longer new, and the club became a "salvation temple."

　II. Examining the Reasons for Failure
　Took the Mass Line
　　Du Yunyue convened the club members, held a meeting to review and accept the lessons of failure, emphasized the responsibilities of each member, and assigned specific tasks, especially to the broadcasting member, to collect materials from each squad and broadcast them. This resulted in more materials. Since one broadcast could not finish everything, two oral broadcasts were conducted every day. Another broadcasting member was added, and the study group leader of each squad also served as a broadcasting correspondent, responsible for collecting broadcasting materials from each squad. In addition to sporadic oral broadcasts, larger events were written on notes and posted on the broadcasting platform. For example, it was broadcast that Comrade Wang Xueyi had blisters and bled on his hands while practicing bayonet fighting, and the weekly training performance rankings were broadcast, so that everyone's achievements and progress were clearly displayed in front of everyone. Therefore, the masses liked it, and the staff worked vigorously, all participating in club activities voluntarily. Soon, a soldier stole sorghum stalks from the common people to bake, and the second squad once took more than one person's worth of food. Both were broadcasted. The squad felt ashamed, and the person who was broadcast was questioned by everyone and cried sadly. The club then held a meeting to study this issue and decided to only broadcast the good things in the future, and leave the shortcomings and problems to the administration to deal with.

　　As the need for broadcasting commendations developed, a rewards and punishments platform was established. Those commended three times would go on the rewards platform, and shortcomings and problems would still be left to the administration to decide whether to go on the punishments platform. In order to exchange experiences with other companies, an exchange center was also established. Those who did well in work and study would have their articles submitted to the Pioneer News, and the reading committee would read them aloud to everyone after they were published. The broadcasting became more active and further combined with Q&A. Broadcasting correspondents often looked at Q&A questions. Whoever didn't answer after the time was up would have their questions brought up in the broadcast. Therefore, the Q&A also became active. Soldiers asked whatever they thought of. For example, during training time, Zhang Hongyu from the Sixth Company was asked, "Why can you stab seven thousand times? What is the principle?" Backward elements were asked, "Why have you been in low spirits recently? What are you thinking about?" "What progress have you made recently? Can you persist?" They also asked questions about current affairs and ideological issues that they did not understand. They asked the regimental commander when they saw him, the chief of staff when they saw him, and anyone who came to the Fourth Company to inspect. As soon as they arrived, they were stuck. Therefore, everyone called it a sticky nest.

　　Once, there were two comrades who didn't like to study at all. They slept during class and didn't speak during discussions. When everyone was studying, they went to the scabies room to sing Erhuang opera. Cadres criticized him, and the military congress struggled against him, but it didn't work. They mobilized the soldiers to ask him from the Q&A column, "What are the benefits of studying for yourself?" "What are your opinions and difficulties about studying?" Everyone gave him paper and pen, and he began to learn one or two characters. He also said one or two sentences during discussions. The broadcasting member immediately broadcasted it, making him both happy and ashamed! The transformation was very good. Using the same method, they transformed a backward element in training into a model of the platoon.

　III. Establishing a Troupe to Consolidate the Army
　　Last September, three soldiers deserted and then returned on their own. Comrade Du Yunyue compiled this material into a five-act play, "Desertion." The plot was the same as the facts, only the names were changed. Because it was about the company's affairs, performed by their own people, and watched by their own people, everyone was willing to do it. If there were no curtains, they patched them together with everyone's bed sheets. If there were no costumes or makeup, they borrowed them everywhere. If there were no stringed instruments, they carved one themselves. Everyone liked watching it very much when it was performed. Those who deserted felt ashamed and excited, and those who didn't desert were vigilant. It not only powerfully carried out anti-desertion education, but also aroused the masses' interest in entertainment.

　　The liveliness of entertainment work made the soldiers have fun in their free time and not feel depressed, which played a great role in consolidating the army. For example, the scouts sent by the regiment to the Second Battalion were asked which company they wanted to go to. He said, "I want to go to the Fourth Company." When asked, "Why?" he said, "The Fourth Company is lively."

　IV. Combining with the Center
　Promote Work
　　After the central work tasks of each period were proposed, the club would study and deploy the work of the Q&A, broadcasting propaganda group, etc., all revolving around the central work. The slogans were also changed to the current work content and slogans. At the beginning of the work, the Q&A broadcasting would carry out brewing and enlightenment. During the work, sporadic commendations and introductions of experience would be carried out. At the end of the work, comparative tables of achievements would be put forward, or lists would be announced to broadcast and call on everyone to learn from good comrades and good models, and to encourage the good ones to move forward without being arrogant.

　　For example, when new soldiers were added last November, the Q&A column asked: "What do you do when new soldiers come and just want to go home and cry?" "How do you help new soldiers who can't do drills?" "What do you do when new soldiers eat slowly and don't get enough to eat?" The propaganda group built a stage and rushed to rehearse plays to welcome the new battles. In daily work and life, new soldiers who performed well were immediately commended by the radio station. The Q&A also changed its content, such as "Why is your squad's new soldier in high spirits?" "Have you fulfilled your promise?" Therefore, the Fourth Company supplemented twelve new soldiers, and only one cook ran away in half a year and also returned.

　　For example, in December, during the selection of heroes, the club changed to a new slogan, and the Q&A column asked: "Who can be a hero?" "How to choose a hero?" and other content. The situation in each squad was brewed, and the radio station broadcasted it. After the heroes were selected, the heroic deeds were announced in the club. The Q&A then asked: "What are your opinions on this election?" "How do you learn from heroes?" They also asked the heroes: "How do you lead the masses?" Finally, the propaganda group performed a play to congratulate the heroes.

　　杜云月的军人俱乐部
    编者按：本文为冀南九分区政治部所编写，杜云月系独立团四连的文化干事，并在群英会上被选为二等工作模范，兹将该文发表于此，以供部队文化工作者参考。
  一、老一套碰了钉子
    去年春末，杜云月同志把俱乐部组织建立起来后，也是整房子，写标语，画漫画，设立这样栏那样栏，开始战士们亦觉着很新鲜，写条子在问答栏上提问题，有的为了报复，你问了我我就问你，也提问题，因此问答栏曾活跃了二十多天。但是因为俱乐部委员不够负责，有的问了题没人答，大家觉着不新奇了，俱乐部也就变成了“救亡庙”。
  二、检讨失败原因
  走了群众路线
    杜云月召集俱乐部委员，开会检讨接受了失败的经验，强调了各委员的责任，分配了具体工作，特别是广播委员，到各班去收集材料，回来广播。这样搞的材料多了，一次广播不完，就每天进行两次口头广播。又增设了一个广播委员，各班的学习组长兼任广播通讯员，负责收集各班的广播材料，除零星的进行口头广播外，大一点的事就写条子贴在广播台上，如广播了王学义同志学刺杀，手上磨了泡，流了血还在刺，广播了每周练兵成绩升降表，使每个同志的一点成绩一点进步，都清楚的摆在大家面前，因此群众都喜欢它了，工作人员也工作的起劲了，都自动自愿的参加俱乐部活动。不久有一个战士偷拿老百姓的秫秸烤，二班有一次多打了一个人的菜，都被广播了，班里觉着很丢人，被广播的人又被大家质问，难过的哭了。俱乐部便开会研究这一问题，决定以后只广播好的，缺点毛病交行政上去处理。
    随着广播表扬发展的需要，又建立赏罚台，表扬三次的即上赏台，缺点毛病仍交行政决定是否上罚台。为了和其他连队交流经验又建立了交流处，对工作学习好的，就写稿投先锋报，刊登后读报委员又读给大家听。广播活跃了又进一步和问答结合，广播通讯员经常去看问答题，谁过了时间没答，就拿来广播。因此问答亦活跃起来了，战士们想起什么问什么，如在练兵时间六连张洪玉“你为什么能刺七千枪？是什么道理？”问落后分子“你近来情绪不高，想什么事？”“你近来有什么进步？能坚持下去吗？”再就是问时事与思想上不明白的问题。见到团长也问，见参谋长也问，见到去检查工作的也问，凡是到四连来的人，一去就被粘住了，因此大家叫它粘窝窝。
    又有一次有两个死不爱学习的同志，上课时他睡觉，讨论时不发言，大家学习时，他到疥房去唱二簧，干部批评他，军人大会斗争他，都不顶事，他们就发动战士从问答栏上去问他，“学习对你自己有啥好处？”“你对学习有啥意见和困难？”大家又送给他纸笔，他也开始学一两个字了，讨论时也说一两句话了，广播委员马上就广播，使他又高兴又惭愧！转变的很好，同样的方法，他们又把一个练兵中的落后分子，改造成为排的模范。
  三、成立剧团巩固部队
    去年九月逃亡了三个战士，又自动归队了，杜云月同志就把这个材料编成了一个五幕剧“开小差”，剧情和事实一样，只把人名变了。由于是连里的事，自己的人演，自己的人看，因此愿意干，没幕布就用各人的被单子凑合缝起来，没衣服化装到处借，没弦子自己刻一个，演起来大家都很喜欢看，开小差的看了又惭愧又兴奋，没开小差的看了警惕，它不仅有力的进行了反逃亡教育，而且引起了群众对娱乐的兴趣。
    娱乐工作的活跃使战士们在闲暇时也好玩，不苦闷，对于巩固部队是起了很大的配合的作用，如团里到二营去的侦察员，问他愿到那个连里去？他说：“愿到四连”问“为什么？”他说：“四连热闹”。
  四、结合中心
  推动工作
    每个时期的中心工作任务提出后，俱乐部就研究布置，问答广播宣传组等各方面的工作，都围绕中心工作进行，标语也换成当前的工作内容和口号，工作开始问答广播就进行酝酿、启发，工作进行中，就进行零星的表扬和介绍经验，工作结束时就提出成绩比较表，或者列榜公布，广播号召向好同志好学习，鼓励好的再向前进，不骄傲等。
    如去年十一月补充新战士时，问答栏就提出：“新战士来了光想家，哭，你怎么办？”“新战士不会操课你怎样帮他？”“新战士吃饭慢吃不饱，你怎样办？”宣传组搭台子，突击排戏，欢迎新战，日常工作生活中，表现好的新战士，广播电台马上便表扬，问答又改换了内容，如“你班新战士情绪很高是什么原因？”“你执行了诺言没有？”因此四连补充了十二个新战士，半年来只跑了一个伙夫也归队了。
    又如十二月选英工作，俱乐部又换了个新标语，问答栏上问：“什么人能当英雄？”“怎样选英雄？”等内容。各班酝酿情形，电台便广播，英雄选出后，把英雄事迹公布于俱乐部，问答又提出：“你对这次选举有啥意见？”“你怎样向英雄学习？对英雄也提出“你怎么带领群众？”等。最后由宣传组演戏贺英雄。
