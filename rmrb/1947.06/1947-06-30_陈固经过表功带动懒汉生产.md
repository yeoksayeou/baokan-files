(Reported from Jinnan, 28th of this month by this newspaper) Chen Gu Village, District Nine, Weixian County, after four days of intensive rush planting, more than 190 mu of uncultivated land have been planted with millet, melons, and vegetables. A summary meeting was held to recognize, compare, evaluate, and elect models. During the recognition, everyone spoke enthusiastically. Li Jin'ai said, "I rushed to plant 14 mu of millet and cowpeas. Even the few mu of hard and dry uncultivated land were planted with seedlings after harrowing and plowing back and forth." Zhang Jinbo said, "The 35 mu of millet I planted was not just worked by myself, even my 70-year-old father did not miss a single work shift. In addition to working full shifts for the team, my father and I also took time to sow our own 7 mu of sorghum and reclaimed 6 mu of wasteland, planting cowpeas. Our team plowed 25 mu of uncultivated land in one day." Village Chief Wu Wenyou continued, "I helped the elderly, weak, and orphans during the day, and worked in the office at night. I got up before dawn to do my own work. That's how I hoed my sorghum and cotton." After others spoke in turn, Zhang Jinbo was democratically elected as the first, and was awarded a new seed drill and a roller. Liu Jinshan and others were also elected as production models, and each was awarded a hoe, a ladle, and a shovel. Because of everyone's recognition and comparison, the laggards Xuan Mingfu and Wu Mingchang were greatly moved. They felt very remorseful and ashamed for not helping or cooperating with others, only loving to drink and enjoy the cool air. The masses took this opportunity to educate and persuade them. They swore to thoroughly reform themselves in the future and were determined to strive to be heroes in production.

　　陈固经过表功带动懒汉生产
    【本报冀南二十八日电】威县九区陈固村，经过四天突击抢种，一百九十多亩白地都种上谷子、瓜菜，总结大会上进行了表功、比功、评功、选举模范。表功中大家发言很热烈，李金爱说：“俺抢种了谷子、豇豆共十四亩，又干又硬的几亩白地也经过砘、耙和来回的犁，栽上了小苗。”张金波说：“俺种的三十五亩谷子不只是我自己作，连俺那七十多岁的老爹也没有缺过一晌工，除了整时整晌作组里活，俺爷俩还抽空耩了自家的七亩高粱，又开荒六亩，点上了豇豆。俺这一组一天就犁了白地二十五亩”。村长吴文有接着说：“俺白天帮助老弱孤寡作活，黑夜办公，天不明就起来加空作自己的，俺那高粱、棉花都是这样锄过来的。”其他人相继表功后，即民主选举了张金波为第一，奖新耧一张、砘子一个，刘金山等也当选为生产模范，每人奖锄一张、勺子一个、锹一个。由于大家的表功、比功，落后分子宣明夫与吴明长大大受了感动，对自己平时既不帮工又不互助，只爱喝酒乘凉，感到十分懊悔与惭愧，群众趁此机会给以教育和规劝，他们宣誓，今后彻底改过，决心在生产上争作功臣。
