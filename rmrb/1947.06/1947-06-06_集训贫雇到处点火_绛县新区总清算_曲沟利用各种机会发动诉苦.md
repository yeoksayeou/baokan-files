(Our Paper, Taiyue, 2nd Dispatch) In Jiang County's new district, land reform has been popularized in thirty-five villages and towns within twelve days. In villages such as Chengjing in the Fourth District and Jiandong in the Third District, which were initiated last year and have some work foundation, the masses, under the leadership of village cadres and militia, took the initiative to divide the land before county and district cadres arrived. Currently, seventeen villages, including Huaiquan and Guanzhuang, are simultaneously carrying out grievance sessions, revenge, anti-reversal of verdicts, and land reform, proposing a "general liquidation and complete liberation" to settle both old and new scores. Among them, ten villages have already achieved land to the tillers, and five villages are also well prepared and will soon begin the struggle. After the county-wide cadre expansion meeting on May 5th, more than eighty capable cadres were transferred to participate in the leadership, and it is expected that land reform in the Third and Fourth Districts can be completed before the wheat harvest. The First and Second Districts will soon be able to switch to land reform, as they have concentrated their efforts on suppressing the remnants of the Chiang-Yan troops after the county's liberation. The reasons for the rapid and vigorous development of land reform in the county are: First, in-depth ideological mobilization. Taking the work area as a unit, meetings of activists with poor and hired peasants as the backbone were held to discuss the current situation, point out that Chiang Kai-shek is bound to be destroyed, distinguish the boundaries between landlords and peasants, and launch grievance sessions. For example, at a meeting of two hundred people in Ji Zai, more than fifty peasants spoke out, proposing to liquidate Yan Xishan's "Oil Shop Manager" (referring to the village chiefs squeezing and exploiting), and put forward the great unity of peasants, "Everyone will bear the burden when the sky falls," and "Share the hardships and share the blessings." Second, taking measures from top to bottom to support the masses, embolden them, and boost their morale. For example, after the government executed Cao Quanli, the heinous puppet police chief in Zouwang Village, more than three hundred people immediately rose up to divide the land. In some villages, the land reform committee directly distributed the land after the masses spoke out.

(Our Paper, Anyang News) The grievance and revenge movement in Qugou has opened up, and the farmers' association has grown to more than three hundred people, with more than twenty new activists emerging. The movement is now being carried out in depth. Initially, due to the landlords and the returning reactionaries conducting cruel counter-settlements and plundering of the peasants during the enemy occupation, the masses were afraid of a change in the political climate. On the other hand, the masses were deceived by enemy rumors and doubted our policies. Based on this situation, propaganda and education were first carried out to expose enemy rumors and use examples to illustrate the changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves. Chiang Kai-shek is on the decline, and the masses' emotions have changed from stability to struggle, and the grievance and revenge movement has rapidly unfolded.

In the process of mobilization, attention was paid to the combination of mass work and various tasks. First, during the government's distribution of relief grain, the investigation of disaster victims was combined with visits to learn of grievances. For example, when the enemy was in power, the counter-settlement was graded, with each mu (approximately 1/6 of an acre) paying four dou (a unit of dry measure), one, three dou, six, etc., and the masses actually received only two or three dou per mu. The masses complained, "Is three dou and six enough? Can we afford four dou and one?" These grievances were initially mobilized and understood in the disaster victim investigation, preparing for the launch of the large-scale grievance session movement. Secondly, the masses were organized to visit and share grievances during the work of breaking down walls and trenches in thirteen villages. Cadres and militiamen went deep into the masses. During breaks, everyone chatted casually, forming small grievance sessions. At the end of work in the evening, there were collective large grievance sessions, with some people crying bitterly. The summary meeting of breaking the city walls became a grievance session, and from the large-scale grievance session, the masses realized their own strength, which greatly promoted the revenge movement in Qugouji and various villages. Regarding the handling of the fruits of the struggle, some landlords sold their land after the counter-settlement last year, and some pawned it. Those pawned or sold to rich peasants or their lackeys were unconditionally taken back and handed over to the original allottees. Those pawned or sold to middle peasants or poor peasants were compensated for their losses from the landlord's remaining property, and the land was still taken back and returned to the original allottees. It was the planting season, so the land was distributed immediately without delaying cultivation. Furniture and wood were gathered together for the masses to claim. Houses were first given to households with no or few houses to live in, and then adjusted. (Joint Office)

　　集训贫雇到处点火
    绛县新区总清算
    曲沟利用各种机会发动诉苦
    【本报太岳二日电】绛县新区土地改革十二天中普及三十五个村镇。四区程景、三区涧东等村，去年曾一度发动，工作略有基础，不等县区干部下去，群众便先在村干部与民兵领导下自动起来分田。现在槐泉、官庄等十七个村子正把诉苦、复仇、反倒算、土地改革一并进行，提出“总清算齐翻身”新愁旧恨一起算，其中十个村已实现耕者有其田，五个村也已酝酿成熟，即将开始斗争。五月五日，全县扩干会议结束后，即抽调八十余得力干部前往参加领导，预计三、四两区在麦收前土地改革即可完成。一、二两区因在该县解放后集中力量剿灭蒋阎溃兵，不久亦可转入土地改革。该县土地改革开展的如此猛烈迅速原因：一、深入思想动员，以工作区为单位，召开以贫雇为骨干的积极分子会议，讨论目前形势，指出蒋介石必然覆灭，分清地主农民界线发动诉苦，如吉在二百人的会议上，就有五十多个农民诉苦，提出清算阎锡山的“油坊掌柜”（指编村村长压榨的意思），又提出农民大团结“天坍下来大家顶”，“有祸同担，有福同享”。二、采取自上而下为群众撑腰壮胆，鼓舞群众斗志，如邹王村经政府将罪大恶极的伪警察局长曹全理正法后，三百余群众立即起来分田，有些村子则于群众诉苦后，即由土地改革委员会直接分配土地。
    【本报安阳讯】曲沟集诉苦复仇运动已打开局面，农会已发展到三百余人，涌现出二十多个新的积极分子，现运动正深入开展中。开始由于敌占时地主、还乡团向农民进行残酷的倒算与掠夺，群众怕变天；另一方面，群众为敌欺骗谣言所迷惑，对我政策怀疑。根据这种情况，首先开展宣传教育，揭破敌造谣，并用实例说明敌我力量的变化，蒋介石已走下坡路，群众情绪由安定到斗争，诉苦复仇运动便迅速展开。
    在发动过程中，注意了群运与各种工作的结合。首先在政府发放救济粮时灾难民调查中结合访苦，如敌在时倒算每亩交四斗一、三斗六等四级，群众实际每亩只收到二、三斗，群众诉苦说：“够不够三斗六，吃不吃四斗一”，这些苦处在难民调查中都作了初步发动与了解，准备了大会诉苦运动的开展。其次在十三村群众参加破围墙壕沟工作中组织群众访苦。干部、民兵深入群众，休息时大家闲拉话，形成小诉苦，晚上收工时集体大诉苦，有的诉得痛哭流涕。破城总结会变成诉苦大会，从大规模诉苦中群众认识了自己力量，这给曲沟集和各村的复仇运动推动很大。关于果实的处理，地主去年倒算后有的把地卖了，有的典了；典、卖给富农或其走狗者，无条件收回交给原分配户，典卖给中农、贫农者，由地主剩余财产中补偿其损失，地仍收回归原分户。时值播种期，马上分配不误耕种。家俱、木料集中起来由群众认领，房子先尽无屋少住的户住，然后再调剂。（联合办公室）
