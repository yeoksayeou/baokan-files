Labor Hero Demonstration Promotes the Entire Village;
Houchi Uses Clapper Talk to Publicize Famine Preparations

[Report from Shexian by Our Newspaper] Houchi Village in the Sixth District widely uses clapper talk to commend heroes, promote demonstrations, and encourage every household in the village to practice thrift and prepare for famine. In the village's campaign to conserve and prepare for famine, they first paid attention to understanding the masses' thinking and clearing their minds. After the leaders initially issued the call for drought prevention, famine preparedness, and frugal living, the masses discussed it, revealing two main ideas: First, they did not make long-term plans, living one day at a time, thinking that in famine years, people would starve to death anyway. Second, they relied on the heavens for rain and food, believing that simply conserving without production was not enough, and that even savings would be borrowed by others in the future. After understanding this thinking, they convened a forum of older farmers, mainly poor and lower-middle peasants, to recall the famine of 1942 and to discuss what to do if seedlings did not grow on the slopes. Labor hero Liu Shiyan said, "We must produce and conserve, live frugally, and remember the lessons of the 1942 famine." He also proposed the slogan: "If we can eat one meal of bran, we can survive two days of famine." At the same time, they composed clapper talk and yangge dances to promote and perform in the streets and marketplaces: "Heads of households, listen carefully, beware of bad harvests and famine years, eat more bran, eat more vegetables, tree leaves and bark are also good, men and women, old and young, unite, let's go gather wild vegetables tomorrow." This kind of propaganda and mobilization greatly encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for production and conservation. Labor hero Liu Shiyan first went back to hold a family forum, reviewing the family's livelihood and telling his father, "What should we do if there are no seedlings in the fields this year?" His father said, "If it doesn't rain, there's really nothing we can do." Then his wife said, "We must be thrifty every day." His father said, "That's right! Everyone must not complain about the food!" Liu Shiyan said, "Agreed." From this discussion, they formulated a family production and conservation plan. The family of six now has four dou of wheat, two shi of rice, five shi of grain, and one shi and six dou of corn, totaling 1,300 jin. Under normal living conditions, each person eats ten liang of rice per day, enough to last eleven months. By reducing their living standard to half a jin of rice per person per day, each person saves two liang per day. The whole year will save 270 jin, enough to eat until the end of June next year. Production plan: Two people, aside from meetings and errands, plan to save 150 workdays, calculated at six jin of rice per workday, saving 900 jin of rice, equivalent to 81,000 yuan. Two women, in addition to doing chores every day, spin three liang of cotton, producing five jin of cloth per month, sixty-four jin per year, calculated at 1,500 yuan per jin, equivalent to 96,000 yuan, totaling 177,000 yuan, to prepare to buy a draft animal (100,000 yuan), and the rest to buy eight sheep and one pig. Having this typical example, they conducted radio propaganda, giving the masses a great impression. Under his influence, all 221 households in the village formulated production and conservation plans. By reducing their living standard, each person in the village saves at least two liang of rice per day, and at most half a jin, so the whole village can save 76 jin of rice every day. They also organized surplus labor to go out and earn rice by helping with the harvest. In addition to doing all kinds of chores every day, the women in the village spin two liang of cotton, planning for the whole village to buy 323 sheep, 12 draft animals, and 27 pigs. Two points of experience: (1) Slogans are weapons to guide the masses. According to the work arrangement, putting forward clear and popular slogans directly encourages the masses' enthusiasm for production. Such slogans as "Don't be afraid of natural disasters and drought, only be afraid of not moving," and "Eating one more day of bran can survive two days of famine" powerfully promote the wave of production and conservation throughout the village. The more clearly the slogans are put forward, the more suitable they are to the masses' taste, and the faster the masses accept them. (2) Educate the masses with the heroes' practical actions. When a hero sets an example, use his example anytime, anywhere, in an organized and systematic way in various streets to promote. Compose clapper talk, establish banners, and educate the masses with typical facts. (Zhenhua)

　　劳英示范推动全村
    后池运用快板宣传备荒
    【本报涉县讯】六区后池村广泛运用快板表扬英雄，宣传示范，鼓动起全村家家节约备荒。该村开展节约备荒运动中首先注意了解群众思想打通群众思想：开始领导上发出防旱备荒细水长流的号召后，群众就纷纷议论，发现思想有两个：一、不作长期打算，吃了一天算一天，灾荒年饿死人也不是光咱哩。二、等天下雨靠天吃饭，光节约不生产也不行，节约下将来也怕别人借。了解这个思想后，以贫雇农为主，召开老汉座谈会，回忆四二年灾荒，提出坡地没苗怎么办？劳动英雄刘士炎说：“咱们要生产节约，细水长流，四二年灾荒就是教训。”他又提出：能吃一顿糠，将来能渡两天荒的口号。同时编出快板秧歌在街头饭市宣传扭唱：当家人注意听，防备灾荒坏年景，多吃糠，多吃菜，树叶树皮也不坏，男女老少团结起，咱们明天去打菜。这样的宣传动员，对群众的生产节约情绪的鼓励很大。劳动英雄刘士炎，首先回去召开家庭座谈会，拉扯家里的生活，给他父亲说地里今年没有苗怎么办？他父亲说：“天不下雨，这实在没法啦。”接着他媳妇说：“咱每天可得俭省哩。”他父亲说：“就是哩！大家可不要说饭坏！”刘士炎说：“可以。”从这样拉扯中订出了全家生产节约计划。全家人六口，现在麦子四斗，米二石，谷五石，玉茭一石六斗，共折一千三百斤。平常生活每天每人十两米，能吃十一个月。降低生活每天每人按半斤米计，每天每人节省二两。全年节省二百七十斤，能吃到明年六月底。生产计划：两个人除开会支差外计划省工一百五十个，按六斤米一工计，省九百斤米，折洋八万一千元，两个妇女每天除做杂活外纺花三两，一月成布五斤，一年六十四斤，每斤按一千五百元计，折洋九万六千元，共计洋十七万七千元，准备买头牲口（十万元），其余买羊八个，买猪一个。有了这个典型的材料，就进行广播宣传，给了群众一个很大的印象，在他的影响下，全村二百二十一户都订出了生产节约计划。全村降低生活每人每天最少省二两米，最多半斤，每天全村可节约七十六斤米。并组织剩余劳力，出外打忙工挣米，全村妇女每天除做一切杂活外，纺花二两，计划全村买羊三二三个，买牲口十二个，买猪二七个。两点经验（一）口号是指导群众的武器。根据工作的按排，提出明确通俗的口号，直接鼓舞了群众的生产情绪。如不怕天灾旱，光怕不动弹，多吃一天糠能渡二天荒等口号有力的推动了全村生产节约的浪潮，口号提的愈明确，适合群众口味，群众接受的也愈快。（二）用英雄的实际行动教育群众。英雄起了模范，就用他的实例随时随地有组织有系统的在各街宣传。编出快板，树立旗帜，用典型事实教育群众。（振华）
