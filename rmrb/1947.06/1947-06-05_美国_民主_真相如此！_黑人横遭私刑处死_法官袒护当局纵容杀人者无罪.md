Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: New York dispatch: In the so-called "democratic," "free," and "equal" United States, barbaric lynchings of black people have occurred one after another recently, while the murderers and thugs are instead protected by judges and condoned by the authorities. In Pickens, South Carolina, a black man named Earl was arrested by the police months ago on suspicion of killing a white man, but was immediately taken to wasteland by many thugs in several trucks, beaten, and his flesh was cut into pieces while he was still alive before finally being shot to death. Although twenty-one murderers were arrested and recently tried in Greenville, in that state, they all frankly admitted to the atrocities. However, disregarding the powerful arguments of the prosecutors and the victim's defense lawyers, the judges sought excuses and have released all the murderers. A similar incident also occurred in Jackson, in that state, on May 23rd. A black man named Basie was arrested on suspicion of "harassing" a white woman. Under the threat of armed thugs, the jailer handed over Basie. Afterwards, the local mayor said, "Basie may have been lynched."

　　美国“民主”真相如此！
    黑人横遭私刑处死
    法官袒护当局纵容杀人者无罪
    【新华社陕北三日电】纽约讯：在所谓“民主”“自由”“平等”的美国，近来相继发生野蛮的私刑处死黑人的案件，而凶手和暴徒们却反而受法官的袒护和当局的纵容。在南加罗林纳州皮肯斯城，有一个名叫伊尔的黑人于数月前以杀害白人的嫌疑被警察逮捕，但随即被乘坐数辆卡车的很多暴徒带往荒地，加以殴击，并活活的将他的肉割成碎片，最后才将他枪毙。凶手虽有二十一人被捕，并于最近在该州之格林维尔城审讯，他们对该项暴行均直认不讳。但法官们不顾起诉人与被害者辩护律师的有力申辩；却寻求借口，已将凶手全部释放。又该州之杰克逊城亦于五月二十三日发生同样事件，黑人巴希以“纠缠”白种女人之嫌疑犯的罪名被捕，在武装暴徒的威胁下，狱卒即交出巴希。事后当地市长说：“巴希或已被私刑处死。”
