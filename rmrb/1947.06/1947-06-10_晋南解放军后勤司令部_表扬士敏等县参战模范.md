　　[This dispatch was] Transmitted by our Taoyue Frontline Office on the 8th. The Jin-Nan People's Liberation Army Logistics Command recently commended model units and individuals from various regions who participated in the Jin-Nan Campaign. The masses of Shimin County who participated in the war followed the troops throughout, resolutely completing the war participation tasks. They won first place in participation. The second-ranked county to be commended was Yangcheng County. In addition, model cadres who led participation were also commended. First place was Comrade Yue Guang, the district chief of the Third District of Gaoping. He took great care of the participating masses at the front line, personally finding housing for everyone upon arrival in each location and visiting each team to offer condolences. Although various difficulties were encountered on the road, because Chief Yue personally resolved the difficulties, everyone maintained a full spirit. When there were sick people on the march, Chief Yue personally carried their luggage for them. The second was Comrade He Xiangli, the farmers' association representative of the Seventh District of Yangcheng. He created the experience of "cadres enduring more hardship so that the masses suffer less." During the battle, he personally led a stretcher team through the blockade line. The third was Comrade Li Shaojiang, chairman of the Farmers' Association of the Sixth District of Shimin. For two months, he shared hardships and tribulations with the masses, educated the masses, and transformed their emotions. The fourth was Comrade Liang Guangtian, the public security assistant of the Seventh District of Jincheng. There were a few cases of retreat and escape in each district of Jincheng, but the team led by Comrade Liang Guangtian never had a single deserter and resolutely completed the task. The fifth was Chen Zijin, a model doctor from Gaoping. He was a liberated peasant who, since departing from Gaoping, gave everyone a preventative decoction to drink four times, and frequently visited each team to see patients, prescribing a total of sixty-two prescriptions, all of which were effective. Sometimes, he even traveled three or four *li* to see patients during the march. The sixth was Comrade Yang Hengyuan, the supply officer of the Yangcheng County Brigade, who ensured the supply of grain for the entire team. The seventh was Comrade Pu Zhifen, the director of the Jincheng Armed Forces Committee, who was the first in the county to volunteer to lead the masses to the front line, which boosted everyone's morale.
