　　The General Post Office Calls on All Employees in the Region to Greet "July 1st" and Strengthen Party Newspaper Distribution

　　[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to commemorate the "July 1st" Party's birthday, the General Post Office has once again called on all our border region employees to implement the speed movement, strengthen Party newspaper distribution, and launch a meritorious service competition, and issued the following instructions:

　　1. In addition to holding forums with relevant agencies and departments to solicit opinions, all bureaus and stations should universally convene general meetings to conduct self-examination and discussion. First, they should ideologically recognize the importance of Party newspapers and clearly establish the concept that distributing newspapers is our political task; overcome all passive thoughts such as simply "subscription agency" and "handling," everyone should be responsible for Party newspapers, and resolutely strengthen Party newspaper distribution.

　　2. Check the newspaper distribution time, identify the reasons, come up with solutions, and immediately improve. Carry enough, walk fast, deliver as soon as they arrive, combine sealing and departure, and strive to stop suppression, avoid wrong dispatch, and avoid losing a single newspaper. Implementing speed transportation is the basic link to strengthen Party newspaper distribution.

　　3. According to the newspaper distribution policy, check the subscription work, develop subscribers, and eliminate blank areas. It is necessary to ensure that every village has newspapers and that they are delivered on time, solicit readers' opinions, and improve work, so that newspaper distribution can be widely and deeply extended to rural areas, marginal areas, and the front lines.

　　4. Attach importance to communication manuscripts and accelerate their transmission. This is our political task. The phenomenon of neglecting this in ideology and business in the past must be deeply examined and quickly improved.

　　5. Around the "July 1st" anniversary, all levels of bureaus and stations should combine it with improving speed transportation, evaluate merits and commend models, and encourage those units (including agency offices, rural post offices, newspaper stations, communication networks, etc.) and employee comrades who care about Party newspapers and have made contributions in newspaper distribution to continue their efforts and launch a meritorious service competition to improve speed and strengthen Party newspaper distribution.

　　The instructions concluded: Significant progress has been made in Party newspaper distribution in the past six months. It is specially called on employees to make more achievements in the speed movement, give full play to the role of Party newspapers, and strengthen the Party's leadership.

　　邮政总局号召全区员工
    迎接“七一”加强党报发行
    【本报特讯】为纪念“七一”党的生日，总局特再次号召我边区全体员工，贯彻速度运动，加强党报发行，开展立功竞赛，并发布如下指示：
    一、除召开各有关机关部门进行座谈，征求意见外，各局站应普遍召集全体会议，连系自己，检查讨论，首先从思想上认识党报的重要，明确树立发行报纸，是我们政治任务的观念；克服一切单纯“代订”、“代办”等消极思想，人人对党报负责，坚决加强党报发行。
    二、检查报纸发行时间，针对原因，想出办法，立即改进，带足走快，随到随投，封发与出发结合，努力做到不停压，不错发，不损失一卷报纸，贯彻速运就是加强党报发行的基本环节。
    三、根据报纸发行方针，检查预定工作，开展订户，消灭空白地区，要做到村村有报，按期送到，征求读者意见，改进工作，使报纸发行向农村向边沿区和前方广泛深入。
    四、重视通讯稿件，加速传递，这是我们的政治任务，过去在思想业务上忽视的现象，必须深刻检查迅速改进。
    五、“七一”纪念前后，各级局站应与提高速运结合起来，评功表模，鼓励那些关心党报，并在报纸发行上有功绩的单位（代办所、乡邮站、报站、通讯网等在内）和员工同志，继续努力，开展提高速度加强党报发行的立功竞赛。
    指示最后称：半年来对于党报发行工作已有显著进步，特号召员工要在速度运动中做出更多的成绩来，发挥党报的作用，加强党的领导。
