　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 14th: A spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army Headquarters solemnly announced to reporters today: According to reliable sources, Chiang Kai-shek has sent the number one Japanese war criminal in the invasion of China, Okamura Neiji, to Xuzhou to directly participate in commanding the offensive against the East China People's Liberation Army. The spokesperson stated: Before the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Okamura Neiji served for a long time as the commander-in-chief of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, and was the inventor and executor of the so-called "Three Alls Policy" (kill all, burn all, loot all). Later, he served as the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Army in China, directing the Japanese invaders to attack the Central Plains and Xiang-Gui. The compatriots across the country suffered countless disasters from him, and hated him to the point of wanting to tear him apart. However, after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, this top-ranked fascist war criminal, under the protection of American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek, was not only not tried and executed according to the law, but lived comfortably in Nanjing as some kind of "liaison officer." According to Chiang Kai-shek, his task was to help repatriate Japanese prisoners; in reality, he was serving as a military advisor for Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the People's Liberation Army. Many so-called "Communist suppression" documents of Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense have been planned with the participation of Okamura Neiji. The repatriation of prisoners was completed long ago, but Chiang Kai-shek resolutely kept this major war criminal in Nanjing, which is the reason. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek's elite reorganized 74th Division was completely annihilated by our People's Liberation Army in Shandong, and Chiang Kai-shek actually sent this Japanese war criminal to directly participate in the Chinese civil war. The spokesperson said: Chiang Kai-shek's use of Okamura Neiji to massacre Chinese compatriots has completely exposed Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous face. However, are the 660,000 Chiang's troops officers and soldiers in the Xuzhou war zone, like Chiang Kai-shek, completely heartless, willing to be commanded by the national enemy Okamura Neiji, under the command of a Japanese fascist war criminal, to massacre their own compatriots? Can the Chiang's army officers in the Xuzhou war zone forget that they are Chinese? Can they forget the deep national hatred since the September 18th Incident? We believe that the result of the traitorous and unpatriotic Chiang Kai-shek's perverse actions will inevitably be contrary to his original intentions, and will inevitably accelerate his own desertion and complete destruction.

　　蒋介石汉奸面貌彻底暴露
    派冈村宁次到徐州直接指挥蒋军作战
    【新华社陕北十四日电】人民解放军总部发言人今日对记者郑重宣称：据可靠消息，蒋介石已派第一号日本侵华战犯冈村宁次到徐州直接参加指挥对华东人民解放军的进攻。发言人称：冈村宁次在日寇投降前，曾长期担任日本华北派遣军总司令，是所谓“三光政策”（即杀光、烧光、抢光）的发明者与执行者。后来又任日本驻华派遣军总司令，指挥日寇进攻中原和湘桂。全国同胞受过他无数的灾难，恨不能生啖其肉。但是抗战胜利之后，这个天字第一号法西斯战犯，却在美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石包庇之下，不但未受审判明正法刑，反而安居南京当起什么“联络官”来。其任务据蒋介石说，是帮助遣送日本俘虏；实际上是做蒋介石进攻人民解放军的军事顾问。蒋介石国防部的许多所谓“剿共”文件，都经过冈村宁次参与其谋。遣俘早已完毕，蒋介石仍把这个大战犯坚决留在南京，就是这个道理。最近蒋介石的精锐整编第七十四师在山东被我人民解放军彻底歼灭，蒋介石竟把这个日本战犯派去直接参加中国内战了。发言人说：蒋介石用冈村宁次来屠杀中国同胞，蒋介石的汉奸面目是彻底暴露了。但是，徐州战区六十六万蒋军官兵，难道是像蒋介石一样全无心肝，甘心在民族敌人冈村宁次的指挥下，在日本法西斯战犯的指挥下，来屠杀本国的同胞么？难道徐州战区的蒋军军官们，能够忘记了自己是中国人么？能够忘记九一八以来全民族的血海深仇么？我们相信汉奸卖国贼蒋介石这样倒行逆施的结果，必然与他原来的企图相反，必然加速自己的众叛亲离，全军覆灭。
