Letter One
Commander Li Wenbo to the Comrades of the Literary Federation:

(Omitted above) ... I am the battalion commander of the ×× battalion of the ×× regiment of the ×× troops. Last year, I wrote two small battle stories, "Wang Gui Becomes Deputy Squad Leader" and "Blood-Stained Communications Squad." Since they were sent out, there has been no news. They were probably lost (Editor's note: We did not receive this manuscript). Later, I did not write to you again. Now I know that this was my fault, and I am determined to correct my attitude of not caring about the cultural garden. Unfortunately, my ability to care about this garden is only that of a mere onlooker. What contribution can I make to it? I am a soldier from a worker-peasant background and only attended elementary school for one year in the past. But it's good that I have some strengths, such as loving to watch, reading aloud to others after watching, and also being brave enough not to be afraid of losing face, daring to write, and loving to learn from others. For example, from 1941 to 1942, I constantly corresponded with Comrade Wang Chun. He taught me punctuation, manuscript format, and grammar in his letters. At that time, I was semi-illiterate, but Comrade Wang Chun taught me patiently (I wonder if he has forgotten this old student he never met). Today, comrades like Zeng Ke are still helping me so patiently, and I will work harder to learn.

Indeed, since the Self-Defense War, there are endless new heroic deeds and touching stories to write about, even to tell! There are moving things happening every day! Unfortunately, not many people in the troops record and preserve these things! I am very sad about this phenomenon. It would be great if comrades from the reporter groups and border region literary federations could often visit the troops. I would really feel lucky for the soldiers! I won't write much in the first letter, let's talk again!

　　来信之一
    营长  李文波文联诸同志：
    （上略）……我是××部队××团×营的营长。去年曾写过《王贵得当了副班长》、《血染的通信班》两个小战斗故事，自发出后音信皆无，可能是丢了（编者按：未收到该稿），后来就没有给你们写过信。现在我已经知道那是自己的不对了，下决心纠正那种对文化园地不关心的态度。可惜我关心这块园地的本事，也不过是个白看者，我能对它有什么供献呢？我是一个工农出身的大兵，过去只上过一年小学，不过我还好，有这样一些长处，就是爱看，看过爱读给旁人听，同时胆子还不小，决不怕丢脸，敢写，还爱向人学习。举个例子说罢，一九四一——四二年，我不断和王春同志通信，他在信上教我标点符号，写稿格式，以及文法等，那时我是个半文盲，可是王春同志就是那样耐心教导我（不知他是否忘了这个不见面的老学生）。今天又有曾克等同志仍是那么耐心帮助我，我将更加努力学习了。
    的确，自卫战争以来，新英雄事迹和可歌可泣的故事是写不完的，甚至也说不完，每天都有动人的事情！可惜部队中是没有很多人记载和保存的！我对这种现象是很难过的。能像现在这样就好了，如记者团、边区文联能有同志经常到部队中走走，我真替战士们感到幸运啊！第一次信不多写，再谈！
