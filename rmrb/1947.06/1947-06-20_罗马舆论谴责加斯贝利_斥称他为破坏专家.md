Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: TASS, Rome: Democratic newspapers here condemn De Gasperi as the person responsible for dividing the unity of the Republic. L'Unità, in an editorial, called him a sabotage expert who has successively split two governments and gradually undermined the democratic republican coalition government formed after June 2nd of last year. At a critical moment, he paralyzed the actual activities of the three governments he directed, and finally formed an alliance with the reactionaries against the representatives of the people. According to reports, serious divisions have already occurred within the Christian Democratic Party; Party member of parliament Bertini told reporters that he and a group of his supporters have protested the one-party government in the party's parliamentary group, and that he and many other parliamentarians do not intend to vote in favor of the news in the Constituent Assembly.

　　罗马舆论谴责加斯贝利
    斥称他为破坏专家
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社罗马讯：此间民主报纸谴责加斯贝利是分裂共和国团结的负责人。团结报在社论里称他为破坏专家，他曾接连分裂过两个政府，并逐渐破坏去年六月二日以后组成的民主的共和国联合政府，在紧急关头使他所指导的三个政府的实际活动都变得瘫痪无力，而且最后和反动派缔结了反对人民代表的联盟。据报载，基督教民主党内部已经发生了严重的分歧；该党议员柏蒂尼告记者说，他和他的一群赞同者已经在该党议会党团里抗议一党政府，他和别的许多议员不拟在立宪会议里投赞成新闻的票。
