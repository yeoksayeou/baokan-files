　　Work Team Supports Confiscation from Landlords
    New District of Guo Village Freely Distributes Land
    [This newspaper's Taiyue 22nd dispatch] In Guo Village, a newly liberated area in Huo County, the mass line was implemented by coordinating efforts from above and below during the land reform to mobilize the masses. When our work team first arrived in the village, because the village was on the railway line and the Chiang-Yan troops passed through here going north and south, the masses suffered greatly. After liberation last July, there was a period of mass movement. However, when the Yan troops returned, many farmers were retaliated against. Therefore, this time, no one dared to come forward. At the beginning of the meetings, everyone pushed the matter to after the summer harvest. The leadership consulted with the active members from last year to organize a secret turnaround committee to give everyone ideas, listen to mass feedback, and monitor bad elements. This raised the courage of the masses, and they immediately identified six targets for struggle. At this time, the work team openly convened meetings of various countries, with all farmers and landlords participating. Comrades from the work team publicized the current situation, and then people from the secret turnaround committee came forward to take the lead, selecting nine young people with activity ability to participate in group discussions to prepare for the struggle, and the targets of struggle were detained. One landlord, knowing that he was going to be struggled against, preemptively held thirty-five packages of opium, preparing to escape. The turnaround committee announced this publicly, further arousing everyone's fighting spirit, saying, "He wants to run away before the struggle even begins! We must struggle against him!" During the struggle, the farmers' eyes were very clear. One of the targets detained by the work team was named Santuzi, who had been a hired worker for more than thirty years and later became rich through labor. He was mistakenly detained. The masses unanimously demanded his release. Santuzi also participated in the struggle like everyone else. After two days and three nights, the entire village was mobilized, and more than 130 piculs of grain were accounted for, and ×× people joined the militia to defend the fruits of the turnaround.

　　工作队撑腰扣地主
    新区郭庄放手分田
    【本报太岳二十二日电】霍县新解放区郭庄在土地改革中用上下配合的办法实现群众路线发动起群众。当我工作队刚到村时，由于该村在铁路线上蒋阎军北上南下皆经此处，群众被害甚重，去年七月解放后，曾有一度群众运动。但阎军卷土重来时，许多农民都被倒算，因此此次谁也不敢出头露面，一开会大家都推到夏收后再说，领导上便与去年的积极分子商量，组织秘密翻身委员会，给大家出主意听取群众反映，监视坏分子，这一来提起了群众的胆量，当即找出六个斗争对象来，此时工作队就公开召集各国开会，全体农民及地主均参加，工作队同志宣传了目前的时局，随即由秘密翻出委员会的人出来出头，选择有活动能力的九个青年参加各组酝酿斗争，并将斗争对象扣押起来，有一地主知道了要斗争，他便预先抱着三十五包鸦片准备逃跑，翻身委员会便当众宣布，更激起了大家的斗争情绪，都说：“还没斗就想跑，非斗不行”！斗争中，农民的眼睛看得很清，工作队扣起的对象中有一个名叫三秃子的，过去曾当过三十多年雇工，后来劳动发了家，被误扣了，群众一致要求放出来，三秃子亦和大家一样的参加斗争，前后共经两天三夜的时间，便将全村群众发动起来，清算出粮食一百三十余石，并有××人参加了民兵保卫翻身果实。
