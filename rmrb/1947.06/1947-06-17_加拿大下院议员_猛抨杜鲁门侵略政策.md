　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 11th: TASS, Ottawa, June 8th: The debate on the government's proposed bill, which grants the U.S. Army the right to maintain military tribunals within Canada, continues in the Canadian House of Commons. Most speakers strongly opposed the bill, denouncing it as leading to Canada's loss of independence. One speaker said: "Passing this bill would mean the United States adding another nine stars to its flag—one for each of Canada's nine provinces." MP Archibald declared: "The Americans are coming to Canada with their judicial institutions, treating us as a country they have already conquered. The United States already has a terrible economic position in Canada, and if its army comes in as well, then they will have everything.” MP Knowles stated: "It is unrealistic to think that Canada can defend itself by binding itself to a powerful neighbor. The fate of the world depends on maintaining peace and security through the United Nations. This bill must be rejected, and no foreign troops should be stationed in Canada during peacetime." Many other MPs vehemently criticized Truman's foreign policy, urging the Canadian government to shift its foreign policy towards the United Nations and to oppose the presence of U.S. troops on Canadian soil.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 13th: Ottawa News: Just as many Canadian MPs were discussing the power to retain U.S. military tribunals in Canada and vehemently criticizing the Truman Doctrine in the House of Commons, Truman arrived in Canada from the U.S. on the 10th for a three-day "visit," and delivered a speech in the Canadian Parliament on the 11th. His speech revealed that the United States regards Canada as a primary area for expansion, and praised Canadian reactionaries as "vanguards" of "cooperation" with the United States. The issues of holding a "Pan-American Conference" and concluding a "Pan-American Convention" have recently become very prominent. Truman's trip is clearly closely related to urging Canada to participate in the Pan-American Conference and the Pan-American Convention, so that Canada can further distance itself from the British Empire and completely obey U.S. imperialism.

　　加拿大下院议员
    猛抨杜鲁门侵略政策
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社渥太华八日电：关于政府所提法案之辩论继续在加拿大下院进行，该法案给予美国陆军在加拿大境内保持军事法庭之权利。大多数发言者都着重地反对该项法案，指谪其为引致加拿大丧失独立，一位发言者说：“通过了该项法案就会意味着美国在它的国旗上加上了另外九颗星——为加拿大九省而加。”议员阿其拜尔德宣称：“美国人带着他们的审判机构来到加拿大，视我们为一个已被彼等征服的国家。美国在加拿大已经有了可怕的经济地位，再开进来它的军队，那就无所不有了。”议员诺莱斯称：“以为加拿大将自己束缚于强邻之下便能防御自己，这是不现实的。世界的命运依赖于通过联合国以维持和平与安全。此一法案必须被否决，而且任何外国的军队在和平时期不应驻留加拿大。”另有许多议员猛烈抨击杜鲁门的外交政策，敦促加拿大政府把外交政策转向联合国，并反对美国军队留在加拿大领土上。
    【新华社陕北十三日电】渥太华讯：正当加拿大许多议员在下院讨论保留驻加美军军事法庭之权力问题，而猛烈抨击杜鲁门主义时，杜鲁门于十日由美抵加，拟作三日之“访问”，并于十一日在加拿大国会发表演说。其演词中透露美国视加拿大为首要扩张地区，吹捧加拿大反动派为与美“合作”的“前锋”。举行“泛美洲会议”与订立“泛美公约”问题近日甚红尘上。杜鲁门此行，显与促使加拿大参加泛美洲会议及泛美公约有密切关联，俾加拿大更进一步的疏远大英帝国而完全听命于美帝国主义。
