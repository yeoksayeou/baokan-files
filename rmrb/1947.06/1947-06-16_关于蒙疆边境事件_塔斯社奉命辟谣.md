　　Regarding the Mongolia-Jiang Border Incident
    TASS Authorized to Refute Rumors
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th】Moscow broadcasted yesterday: The China "Central News Agency" spread a dogmatic statement by the spokesman of the Chinese (referring to the Chiang government) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claiming that Soviet-flagged aircraft participated in the border incident that occurred on June 5th on the border between Mongolia and Xinjiang between the border defense forces of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Chinese army (referring to the Chiang army). TASS is authorized to state: The aforementioned statement by the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is inconsistent with the facts and is a provocative fabrication. (Note: The Central News Agency has been vigorously spreading rumors in recent days that Soviet aircraft are cooperating with Outer Mongolian troops in entering the Xinjiang border.)
