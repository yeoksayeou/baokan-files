　　The Ren Xiuhe Militia Work Team in the Defense of the Wheat Harvest
    Hu Zhirui
    The wheat has ripened, and the vicious landlord reactionary heads, Liu Mingdao, Liu Hengxin, and others, have purchased two more White Russian Maxim guns, preparing to seize the food from the mouths of the masses, the fruit of a year's labor. Thus, the Red Sand Ridge and the Gaoyao River South Ridge, stretching across ten miles of seven gullies and eight ridges, have become battlegrounds for the struggle over the wheat harvest.
    At the wheat harvest mobilization meeting, the eyes of the masses focused on the face of Comrade Ren Xiuhe, the militia work team leader: "If Old Ren says we can eat the wheat, then we can eat it!" Ren Xiuhe assured everyone: "If we don't finish harvesting the wheat, we won't leave Red Sand Ridge." Everyone laughed, confidently planning the wheat harvest for each village. The militiamen each made plans to kill the wheat-grabbing devils; the women militia also prepared to use hand grenades to strike the grandsons of the robbers; men and women, old and young, militiamen, and self-defense forces closely united around Comrade Ren Xiuhe, launching an armed struggle to protect the wheat harvest.
    Combining Landmines and Guns
    Three Battles, Three Victories
    The militia team and the work team went up the mountain with their backpacks. On May 27th, before the stars had faded, the militiamen ambushed on the Henghe Ridge killed one member of the Shijian Self-Defense Corps and wounded three others. The enemies from Shangbaizuo, Shijian, and Yanhe were not convinced and attacked in three routes with machine guns, but were all blocked at the front hill. On the 28th, the enemy again attacked the mountain in three routes, but the militiamen held the ridge and repelled the enemy, several hand grenades wounding three of them. On the morning of the 29th, everyone went down the mountain to eat. The enemy took the opportunity to occupy the South Ridge. Everyone said: "We shouldn't have left the ridge; we suffered a loss, we have let the people down." But as soon as the enemy passed the South Ridge of Xiaozhao Village, three landmines exploded. Three enemies were coming down from Red Sand Ridge towards the mountainside when a landmine blew one fellow over. Then more than twenty enemies rushed down in two groups. A volley of gunfire knocked one over, and they all scrambled back. The team members were very happy, feeling that the landmines should be sent closer to the enemy. On the night of the 30th, mines were buried on the lower half of the slope where the enemy was coming up. Sure enough, as a dozen enemies carefully approached the pillbox, one of the fellows in the back stepped on one, and a burst of smoke sent a bunch of enemies scrambling back with their colorful flags. From the night of the 26th, when the wheat harvest began, the enemy came up the mountain every day, never returning empty-handed, but the gifts given to the enemy were not wheat, but the enemies themselves, killed and wounded by landmines and stone mines. The landmines in Gaoyao River were pushed into the gully by the enemy, and Comrade Chang Dingguo immediately developed two-eyed mines, so that if the enemy tried to push them again, they would explode upon being pushed. The Deputy Director of the Municipal Armed Forces Confederation personally trained explosives experts, combining landmines and guns to kill the enemy with mines.
    Gunshots Boom on the Mountain
    Wheat Harvest Below Busier Than Ever
    In order to quickly complete the rush harvest, the rear supported the front lines. All the able-bodied men and women from Zhongwei and Beiye villages were mobilized to form two harvest assistance teams, bringing their own dry rations to help Maiganghe Gaoyaohe with the rush harvest day and night. "Gunshots boom on the mountain, the wheat harvest below is busier than ever." Captain Ren did not retreat, and the masses did not retreat either. On the 28th, the enemy and we were at a standoff at the Xiaozhao Village ridge, and the enemy had occupied the Red Sand Ridge hilltop, but the people of Xiaozhao Village remained calm and continued to harvest. On the 31st, the fighting continued in front of Red Sand Ridge, but the wheat in Longbei Gully (only forty or fifty steps from our position) did not stop being harvested. Women and children carried the wheat while cutting it, cheerfully and unconcerned, "What are we afraid of? Captain Ren's people are in front, it's very safe." On the 28th, the local tyrant self-defense corps of Nianpanddi Village in front of Red Sand Ridge cut the wheat and piled it on the ground. After we reconnoitered, we immediately mobilized all the laborers and carried back the wheat of Wang Quanti and Wang Zhongyin, etc., of the tyrant self-defense corps, without touching any of the people's wheat, and posted notices from the Special Commissioner's Office and the Municipal Government on the street. The agricultural association cadres who had moved from Nianpan Gully to the mountains also put their names on three notices, telling the masses: Whose wheat was confiscated and whose wheat was protected. Two cadres went deep into the small villages near the stronghold to distribute leaflets and post notices, and also set fire to a wheat field of the big tyrant Liu Mingdao, the head of Bailing Township, which had been seized from the people.
    Preliminary Experience
    1. Collectively organize labor and armed strength, harvest collectively, and hide collectively. The villages are scattered, the labor force is dispersed, and the mountain plots are small. To be fast and save labor, they are concentrated into three small joint defenses, with the three larger villages of Maiganghe, Xiaozhao Village, and Gaoyaohe as the base. Collective accommodation, collective meals, and a steward are selected. The elderly and weak who cannot work in the fields gather firewood, grind flour, cook, and deliver messages, and the women leave their children at home to be collectively cared for by the old women. Because the plots are small and scattered, they cannot be loaded and attacked by household, but only by area. All the wheat in the village, regardless of whose it is, is harvested as soon as a patch ripens. After the harvest, it is still stored together. How to calculate the accounts is still being discussed. The principle is to distribute grain according to the quality of the land, the number of mu, and to calculate points based on the amount of labor and the number of days worked. 2. Unified leadership, combining labor and armed forces. The village command post unifies the leadership of the wheat harvest, the village chief and the chairman of the agricultural association are in charge of the labor force, the director of the armed forces committee and the militia captain are in charge of the militia, and there are also labor recorders, propagandists, and liaison with the district command. The labor force is also divided into women's, children's, and elderly groups. In case of emergency, they listen to the militia's notification and transfer separately. If the enemy's firepower is not strong, they will persevere and not retreat. For example, on the 28th, the enemy had occupied the ridge east pillbox, and our militia work team persisted on the South Ridge without retreating, while the people continued to harvest wheat at the foot of the slope. 3. Cadres take the lead in electing models, and district and village cadres personally participate in the rush harvest. The district office sent out everyone except the cook who made food for the militia. The village cadres have also become models in the wheat harvest, and the women's federation chairwomen Lian Qiying and Zhao Lanying harvested faster than others. Hao Guoxiang, a carpenter in his fifties, did not rest after harvesting wheat and carried water and gathered firewood. The director of the armed forces committee did not leave the mountain even after injuring his leg. Because the cadres took the lead in praising the models, everyone worked day and night; the children also rushed to carry three or two bundles. 4. The rear supports the front lines, Zhongwei supports Maiganghe, Beiye supports Gaoyaohe, and Lao Niuhe supports Xiaozhao Village, with an average of more than fifty full and half laborers every day. At first only men came, but later women also came. They brought their own dry rations, sickles, and carrying poles, and some did not go back at night. The militia also went down to the river to help fight the enemy. This spirit of fraternal love further encouraged the people of the river to defend the wheat harvest.

　　保卫麦收中的任秀荷武工队
    胡之锐
    麦子黄了，狠毒的还乡倒算头子刘明道、刘恒心等，增购白拉林机枪两挺，准备来抢夺群众一年血汗换来的嘴边饭。于是纵横十里七沟八梁的红沙岭和高窑河南岭就成了麦收的争夺阵地。
    麦收动员会上，群众的眼光集中在武工队长任秀荷同志的脸上：“老任说麦子能吃就能吃！”任秀荷向大家保证：“割不完麦子，咱就不下红沙岭。”大家笑了，信心十足的计划各村的麦收。民兵们各自订出杀敌计划，妇女民兵也准备好用手榴弹打抢麦的鬼孙们；男女老少、民兵、自卫队紧紧的团结在任秀荷同志的周围，展开了武装保麦斗争。
    雷枪并用
    三战三捷
    民兵队、武工队背着背包上了山头。五月二十七日，满天星斗未落，埋伏在横河岭头的民兵就打死了狮涧自卫团一人，打伤三人。上白作、狮涧、阎河的敌人不服气，扛了机枪三路打来，但都被阻击在前山头。二十八日敌人又三路上山，民兵们坚持岭头打退敌人，几个手榴弹打伤了他们三个人。二十九日早上，大家下山吃饭，敌人乘隙占了南岭，大家都说：“咱好不该下岭，吃了亏，咱可对不起老百姓。”但敌人一过小赵庄南岭就踏响了地雷三个。三个敌人由红沙岭向山半坡下时，一个地雷把一个家伙崩了个仰面朝天。接着又有二十多个敌人分两股往下冲。排子枪一响，被打翻了一个，于是又一齐爬回去了。队员们高兴的很，觉得雷应该再往敌人跟前送送。三十日夜，在敌人上来的下半坡埋下了雷，果然十几个敌人很小心的走上炮楼时后边一个家伙正好踏上，一股狼烟，一伙敌人狼狈的抬着彩号炮了。从二十六日夜麦收开始，敌人没有一天不上山的，也没有一次空回去的，但送给敌人的礼物不是麦子，而是被地雷、石雷炸死炸伤的敌人自己；高窑河的地雷被敌人推到山沟里，常定国同志马上研究出两眼雷，如果敌人再推时一推就响。市武连副主任亲自培养爆炸手，雷枪结合，用雷杀敌。
    山头砰砰枪响
    山下割麦越忙
    为了迅速完成抢收，后方支援前线。中围、北业两村男女全劳力全部出动，组成两个助收队，自带干粮，帮助麦秸河高窑河日夜抢收。“山头砰砰枪响，山下割麦越忙。”任队长不退群众也不退。二十八日小赵庄岭头敌我对峙，红沙岭山头敌已占领，但小赵庄老百姓仍沉着气一直割，三十一日，红沙岭前边一直打，龙背沟（距我阵地仅四、五十步）麦子也没停止割。妇女儿童边割边扛，喜笑自若，“怕啥，任队长的人在前面，老保险”。二十八日红沙岭前碾盘地村的恶霸自卫团割下麦子堆在地里，我们侦察好了，马上动员所有劳力，把恶霸自卫团王全体、王忠印等的麦子给扛回来，老百姓的一点没动，并把专署市府的布告贴到街上。碾盘沟转移到山上的农会干部们也具了自己的名字贴下三张布告，告诉群众：没收谁的麦子，保护谁的麦子。两个干部深入到据点附近小村去散传单、贴布告，还放火烧了大恶霸白陵乡乡长刘明道抢夺老百姓的一场麦子。
    初步经验
    一、集体组织劳武力量，集体割、集体藏。村庄零落劳力分散，山地块小，要快要省工，就集中成三个小联防，以麦秸河、小赵庄、高窑河三个大一点的村为基点。集体住宿、集体吃饭，选有事务长。不能上地的老弱打柴、推磨、做饭、送信，妇女们把小孩留在家里由老婆婆集体照管。因为地块小、分散，不能按户装按户打，只能按片，全村麦子不管张三李四的，黄一片割一片。打好后仍伙着放，如何算账还正在商讨。原则上是根据地质好坏、亩数多少分粮食，根据劳力大小地费工数折工记分。二、统一领导劳武结合。村指挥所统一领导割麦，村长农会主席掌握劳力，武委会主任民兵队长掌握民兵，并设记工、宣传和区指挥部取连系，宣传各地经验。劳力也分妇女、儿童、老年等组。如有情况，听候民兵通知分别转移，如敌人火力不强，则坚持不退。如二十八日敌人已占岭东炮楼，我民兵武工队在南岭上坚持不退，老百姓则照常在坡跟割麦。三、干部带头选举模范，区村干部亲自参加抢收，区公所除留了伙夫给民兵做饭外，全体出动。村干部在割麦中也都成了模范，妇女会主席连启英、赵兰英割得都比别人快。五十多岁的木匠师傅郝国香割麦回来不休息就又担水打柴，武委会主任腿负伤后仍不下山；由于干部带头表扬模范，就使得大家不分黑夜白日的干；儿童们也都三捆两捆抢着背。四、后方支援前线，中围支援麦秸河，北业支援高窑河，老牛河支援小赵庄每天平均全半劳力在五十人以上。开始只男人来，以后妇女们也来了。他们自带干粮、镰、扁担，有的黑夜也不回去。民兵也下了河道帮助打击敌人。这种友爱精神更鼓舞了河道群众的保麦斗争。
