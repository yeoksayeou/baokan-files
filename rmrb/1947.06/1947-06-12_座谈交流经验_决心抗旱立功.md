　　Exchange Experiences in Symposiums
    Determined to Combat Drought and Contribute
    Yao Huozhu, a labor hero from Yuanqu, whose family of two consumes two and a half jin of rice a day. Seeing the drought, to prepare for famine, they save one jin every day, supplementing it with three liang of dried wild vegetables. He also planted 50 pumpkin seedlings on the river beach. He made specific plans for his own food and guided the masses, inducing them to plan their time. The whole village launched a production movement to gather wild vegetables through such in-depth planning, from small to large. So far, the entire village has gathered more than 10,000 jin of wild vegetables. Through such exchanges and symposiums, a new style became clear in thought. Village Chief Lian Quan said, "We have all completed our work, but our methods are not the same as others. This time when we go back, we must use accounting methods in depth, and guarantee that five households will be organized to repair beaches and gather wild vegetables within three days." Then the district leaders put forward the call to greet "July 1st" and celebrate the Party's birthday, and to further carry out the campaign to contribute to the people. Each cadre made their own plan to contribute. Yao Huozhu, a labor hero from Yuanqu, said: "When I go back, I will personally lead the masses to use more than 200 workdays to repair the bad ditch under Qingfengdi in our village, and turn hundreds of acres of dry land into fertile fields." Feng Linji, chairman of the Huangyan Farmers' Association, proposed: to mobilize the masses to carry water to irrigate flower seedlings, to ensure that more than 60 acres of seedlings do not die from drought. In the atmosphere of high spirits, a merit evaluation committee was established, and it was decided to conduct a comprehensive inspection on "July 1st." At present, each village is carrying out a production and famine preparation movement to contribute to the people. (Fifth District Correspondent Group)

　　座谈交流经验
    决心抗旱立功
    原曲劳动英雄姚火柱，全家一天两口人吃二斤半米，眼看天旱为了备荒，每天节约一斤，打三两干野菜补助，并到河滩栽了五十苗南瓜，在饭食上自己具体计划，并给群众圪扯，诱导群众打算时光，全村就在他这样的由小而大的深入打算中，开展了生产打野菜运动。到现在全村共打野菜一万多斤。这样经过大家的交流座谈，新的作风在思想上明确起来。连泉村长说：“工作吧，咱也都完成了，就是在方法上不和人家一样，这遭回去，可要深入用算账办法，三天要保证发动起五户有组织的修滩打野菜。”接着区的领导上便提出了迎接“七一”向党祝寿，更进一步的开展为民立功号召，每个干部都订出了自己的立功计划，原曲劳动英雄姚火柱说：“我回去要亲自领导群众用二百多工把俺村清风迪下边的那道坏渠修起来，将百亩旱地变成良田”。黄岩农会主席冯林吉提出：要发动群众担水浇花苗，保证六十多亩禾苗不让旱死一棵。在大家情绪高涨的空气中，成立起评功委员会，决定到“七一”作全面的检查，现各村正开展着生产备荒为民立功运动。（五区通讯小组）
