　　Old Hero Kan Fuchen Establishes Counter-Offensive Plan
　　[Reported from the Yubei Front, this newspaper, 23rd] Kan Fuchen, the 43-year-old hero and deputy platoon leader of the Nenjiang unit, announced his counter-offensive plan at the unit's model hero conference, saying: "First, I will tell all comrades in the class and platoon about the heroic deeds of our comrades, creating a wave of enthusiasm for learning from heroes and establishing the glorious idea of becoming revolutionary heroes. Second, we will resolve our difficulties in the counter-offensive by eliminating the enemy, promoting our own and the soldiers' hatred and contempt for the enemy. Third, we will not stop until we have defeated and completely overthrown Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous and dictatorial rule." Hero Kan is from Qi Zhi County (formerly Qu Zhou) in Jinnan. He requested to join the army three times. The first two times, the village cadres advised him not to go because of his age. It was not until January of this year, when he firmly requested to join the army for the third time, that he was approved by the county. When Kan Fuchen arrived at the Nenjiang unit, the six young people who traveled with him were all assigned to squads, leaving him alone. He thought to himself, "What's going on? Am I not needed?" The company commander found him and said, "You are old and can't walk. Go to the kitchen!" Kan Fuchen shouted anxiously, "Don't think I'm a new recruit. Pick your best veteran to compare with me. If I can't outrun him, I'll go be a cook." The company commander saw that he was very determined and assigned him to an infantry squad. During the long march, Kan Fuchen not only kept up with the troops but also carried guns and backpacks for his comrades. In the battle to pursue and annihilate the 49th Brigade, he was very brave, so he became a squad leader in less than ten days. When the leadership learned of his history and ability, they immediately promoted him to deputy platoon leader. With the great spirit of a conscious farmer, he praised his glorious history of joining the People's Liberation Army, saying, "When the Communist Party came, we poor people had land to cultivate and food to eat. I couldn't bear just watching others join the army to protect the fruits of our labor; moreover, joining the army is for the liberation of the poor, which is extremely glorious, so I insisted on joining the army."

　　老英雄阚富臣订立反攻计划
    【本报豫北前线二十三日电】嫩江部四十三岁老英雄副排长阚富臣，于该部英模大会上宣布他的反攻计划说：“第一，我要把同志们的英雄事实向全班全排讲，让同志们造成学习英雄热潮，树立当革命英雄的光荣思想。第二，反攻中以消灭敌人来解决我们的困难，发扬自己和战士们仇恨敌人、卑视敌人的思想。第三，不把蒋介石卖国独裁统治打垮，打干净不止。”阚英雄系冀南企之县（旧名曲周）人，曾三次要求参军，最初两次村干部因他年纪大，劝他不要去。到今年正月，他第三次坚决要求参军才得到县里批准。阚富臣到嫩江部，和他同路的六个青年人都分配到班里，只剩下他一个人，他心里想：“这是怎么回事，不要了？”连长找他说：“你年纪大了，走不动，去伙房吧！”阚富臣急的大声叫道：“别看我是新战士，把你最好的老战士挑来比一比，我跑不过就去当炊事员。”连长见他很坚决，把他分到步兵班里。长行军中，阚富臣不但能跟上部队，还能替同志们背枪，背背包。追歼四十九旅之战，他非常勇敢，所以不到十天就当了班长。等到领导上了解了他的历史和才能，立刻提拔成副排长。他曾以自觉农民的伟大气概，赞颂自己参加解放军的光荣历史，他说：“共产党来了，我们穷人有地种，也有饭吃了，光看人家参军保卫果实，自己心里下不去；再说参军是为了穷人翻身，边极光荣，所以我就赖上参了军啦。”        （方德）
