Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 7th. A unit of the Guanzhong People's Guerrilla Force liberated Taibaozi, 30 li northwest of @yi County, on the 3rd. This place was the seat of the Chiang Kai-shek county government. Now, except for Zhitian Town, which is an isolated stronghold of the Chiang-Hu army, the entire county has been liberated, and the new democratic regime of the county has been established. The liberation of Taibaozi only took a few hours to end the battle, capturing more than 120 people, including the Chiang government @yi County magistrate Bian Yifan and self-defense forces, seizing more than 80 guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. At the same time, a unit of the People's Guerrilla Force repulsed the Hu army's Independent Regiment, which came to援(aid) from Zhitian Town, killing and wounding more than 50 enemies. Another company of enemies from @ County was also defeated.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. A U.S.-made P40 Chiang Kai-shek plane was shot down by a sharpshooter of the People's Liberation Army in the Zhangjiachuan area, about 15 kilometers west of Panlong, at about 5 p.m. on the 4th while bombing and strafing. The plane number was 420, and it caught fire and was destroyed after being hit.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 6th. Chen Yingquan, deputy brigade commander of the Chiang-Hu army's 2nd Cavalry Brigade, and Wang Tao, commander of the 3rd Regiment, who were captured in the Huachi battle in Longdong on the 30th of last month, have now safely arrived in the rear of the People's Liberation Army. Chen is from Tumote Banner, Suiyuan, and is in his forties. When reporters interviewed him, he shook his head repeatedly and sighed deeply, seemingly with infinite emotion. Chen said, "Brigade Commander Bai (i.e., Bai Haifeng) took the wrong path. He shouldn't have accepted Chiang Kai-shek's bribe. An Inner Mongolian ethnic armed force that he had built up for many years has become Chiang Kai-shek's private property, loyally dying for him, to the point of ending up like this." Wang Tao, who was born in Kulun, Jehol, said, "We had no choice but to attack the border area! Chiang Kai-shek forced us to do so. You will understand me in the future." He hopes to see Yun Ze (i.e., Ulanhu, the leader of the Inner Mongolian people) and is willing to do his part for the liberation of the Inner Mongolian people.

　　关中人民游击队
    解放太堡子
    歼蒋记＠邑县府
    【新华社陕北前线七日电】关中人民游击队一部，三日解放＠邑县城西北三十里之太堡子。该地为蒋记县政府所在地，现该县全境除职田镇为蒋胡军一个孤立据点外，已全部解放，该县民主新政权已告建立。解放太堡子仅数小时即结束战斗，俘蒋政府＠邑县长边翼藩以下自卫队等一百二十余名，缴枪八十余支，子弹千余发。同时人民游击部队一部击溃由职田镇出援之胡军独一团，毙伤敌五十余名，另由＠县出援之敌一个连亦被击溃。
    【新华社陕北七日电】美造Ｐ４０式蒋机一架，四日下午五时许在蟠龙以西约十五公里的张家川地区轰炸扫射时，被解放军某部神枪手所击落。该机号码为４２０，已于被击中后着火焚毁。
    【新华社陕北前线六日电】上月三十日陇东华池战斗中被俘之蒋胡军骑二旅副旅长陈应权、第三团团长汪韬，现已安抵人民解放军后方。陈氏为绥远土默特旗人，四十多岁。当记者访问他时，他连连摇头，长吁短叹，似有无限感慨。陈说：“白旅长（即白海峰）路走错了。万不该接受蒋介石的收买，他经营多年的一支内蒙民族武装变成蒋家私产，忠实的替他效死，以至落得这个下场。”出身热河库伦的汪韬说：“我们进攻边区是没办法呀！是蒋介石强逼我们这样干的。将来你们会了解我的。”他希望看到云泽（即乌兰夫，内蒙人民领袖），并愿为内蒙人民解放事业尽一份责任。
