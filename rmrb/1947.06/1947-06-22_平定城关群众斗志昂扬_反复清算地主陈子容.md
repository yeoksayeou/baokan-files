　　Pingding City Residents are in High Spirits
    Repeatedly Liquidating Landlord Chen Zirong
    [Reported by our newspaper in Pingding] In the first struggle, the neighborhoods of Chengguan retrieved very little property from the landlords, and these things were all prepared by the landlords in advance. Most of the real property was hidden and scattered. Some people hid almost all of their family property, preparing to resist the masses. However, at this time, some of the masses were deceived by the landlords and developed ideas such as "almost the same, fundamentally poor." The leadership immediately mobilized the masses to recognize the landlords' conspiracy and stubborn tricks, insisting on making the landlords bow their heads and return the blood and sweat of the masses. Methods such as comparing living conditions, estimating family property, and meticulous calculations were used to mobilize the masses ideologically. At the same time, discussions were held on whether the landlords had bowed their heads, why they hadn't bowed their heads, whether the property had been taken away, and why it hadn't been taken away, in order to raise the consciousness of the masses. When struggling against the landlord Chen Zirong in Xuemen Street, he showed great stubbornness. At this time, the masses unanimously said: "If the landlord is stubborn, we will be even more stubborn! We must thoroughly struggle against the dog!" Everyone unanimously recognized that only struggle can lead to victory. At the same time, methods of calculation and estimation of family property were used to directly ask Chen Zirong where he had hidden the goods and money. This proved with facts that the landlord had nothing to say. The first time he admitted to having two pairs of gold bracelets, several rings, and other small things, but he was still unwilling to bow his head. At this time, the masses were in high spirits and became more energetic as they struggled. The second time, he took out 330,000 yuan in customs gold notes. After several repeated struggles, the landlord Chen Zirong slightly lowered his head. At the same time, methods such as holding large and small meetings combined with individual mobilization were used to achieve great results in five streets including Dongguan, totaling 5,045 silver yuan, 118 packages, 42 ingots, 30 shi of grain, 330,000 yuan in customs gold notes, and many gold bracelets, rings, quilts, etc. Through this pursuit of feudalism, the landlords' conspiracy was exposed with facts, making the masses realize the landlords' stubbornness, and at the same time further mobilizing the masses. Currently, the fruits of the struggle are being distributed, and deeper struggles are being醞酿.

　　平定城关群众斗志昂扬
    反复清算地主陈子容
    【本报平定讯】城关各街在第一次斗争中，退出地主财物很少，而且这些东西也都是地主事先准备好了的，真正的财产大部分都隐散了，有的几乎全部家产作了隐藏，准备和群众顽抗。但这时有部分群众受地主欺骗，产生了“差不多、根本穷”等思想。领导上当即发动群众认识地主阴谋及顽强花样，一定要使地主低头，退出群众血汗，并用比光景、估家当、细致计算等方法从思想上发动群众，同时结合讨论地主是否低头，为啥不低头，财产是否拿光，为啥不拿光，以此来提高群众觉悟。在学门街斗争地主陈子容时，表现非常顽强，这时群众一致说：“地主顽强咱更顽强，非彻底斗争狗日不可！”大家一致认识只有斗争才能胜利，同时用计算、估家当办法直问陈子容把东西款都藏到那里了。这样以事实证明地主无话可讲，第一次承认了两对金镯、几个戒指等小东西，仍不愿低头，这时群众情绪很高，越斗越有劲，二次又拿出三十三万元关金票。这样反复几次斗争、地主陈子容才稍为低头。同时开大小会结合个别动员等办法，在东关等五个街搞出很大成绩，计共追出果实银洋五千零四十五元，包袱一百一十八个，元宝四十二个，粮食三十石，关金票三十三万元，金镯、戒指、被褥等很多。经过这次追封建，以事实揭破地主的阴谋，使群众认识地主的顽强，同时也进一步发动了群众。目前正在分配果实，并酝酿深入斗争。
