　　Yubei Guerrilla Forces Launch Major Operation to Protect Wheat
    Chiang Kai-shek's Puppet Troops' Looting Attempt Will Surely End in Miserable Failure
    [Report from Our Newspaper] The wheat on the vast plains south of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway is ripe. The guerrilla groups south of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway have mobilized to protect the ongoing counter-liquidation movement and safeguard the wheat harvest for the masses. On May 10th, the Wuzhi and Jiaozuo guerrilla forces ambushed the enemy in Fucheng, completely annihilating over 20 puppet self-defense soldiers in a ten-minute battle. On May 19th, they captured over ten local tyrants who were looting grain in Tielutou (Wuzhi County), shocking the enemy and puppets. The enemy and puppets in other locations were repelled more than ten times. One battle on May 23rd in Houdong Village (Xiuwu County) repelled an attack by over 200 puppet security soldiers from Xiuwu, killing or wounding over ten enemy soldiers and capturing four alive. The enemy left behind four corpses and fled back to Xiuwu City in disgrace. We suffered only two minor injuries. The masses applauded and voluntarily sent noodles and vegetables to the troops as a sign of appreciation.
    In addition to fighting, our troops also launched mass propaganda and wheat harvesting assistance movements. For example, wherever the Matun troops went, the propaganda teams carried out widespread propaganda to the masses, and costumed yangko dance teams frequently appeared on the streets. Except for the guard troops, all other troops were organized to help the families of revolutionary martyrs and those without labor power with the wheat harvest.
    Local militia and armed work teams are also actively organizing forces to protect the wheat harvest and strike at the enemy. The Yang (Juhe) and Ren (Xiuhe) armed work teams of the first and second districts of Jiaozuo killed or wounded 15 enemy soldiers in eight days. From the early morning of May 21st, puppet "self-defense corps" from Shangjiuzuo, Yanhe and other villages around Jiaozuo, as well as Chiang's troops from Wangfeng, Lifeng, and Fengfeng, led struggle targets, counter-liquidation leaders, and special agent landlords from the stubborn areas, came to our mountainous areas to loot wheat every day with one or two hundred people. Our militia and armed work teams then actively protected the wheat harvest in the strongholds on both sides of the Jiaozuo-Boai Highway. The front mountains of Jiaozuo – Hongshaling and Nan寺ling – became the focus of the struggle between the enemy and us. From May 21st to 24th, the enemy and puppets who invaded and looted grain at Hongshaling, Nan寺ling, and the northern mountain of Tazhang were continuously attacked by our militia and armed work teams using a combination of landmines and sniper fire, wounding a total of 14 people. On May 25th, two platoons of the Lifeng puppet self-defense corps, leading more than 100 civilians, went to Sizhang Village to loot wheat and set fire to the wheat that the people had cut and brought to the threshing floor in Luoquanzhang Village. The Yang Juhe militia team fought the enemy while putting out the fire. Comrade Zhao Delu's hand towel and socks were burned by the fire, and he said, "It is an honor to be burned for the masses!" The enemy came out every day, and the Yang Juhe team figured out the enemy's activity patterns, understood the terrain, measured the distance, organized landmine laying and sniper fire. Before dawn on May 27th, the entire team launched an attack, actively ambushing near the Hongshaling blockhouse. At 11:00 a.m., the enemy came out of Lifeng as usual, went up Gaozhai Ridge, and a platoon of puppet self-defense corps, with two machine guns, was covering more than a hundred civilians to loot wheat. They advanced in three routes, and each route was sniped by our snipers, wounding several people. The scattered enemies then concentrated near the Five Blockhouse and continued to invade, and one was shot down. When the enemy stepped into the landmine fire circle, the signal grenade for commanding the landmine laying exploded, followed by the bombing of the landmines. The enemies were in a panic in the smoke and were blown down nine. This battle was well fought, so that the enemy's two machine guns did not play any cover role (could not find our target), and did not loot wheat, but instead carried three seriously injured and supported four slightly injured back in defeat. On the 28th, a grain looting team of dozens of people from the Shangbaizuo puppet "self-defense corps" was wounded three by the Ren Xiuhe armed work team of the First District Militia. On the same day, the Municipal Armed Forces Association held a cadres' meeting in ×× Village to exchange experiences, and the mood was even higher.
    After crushing the enemy's continuous seven-day (May 14th-21st) grain looting and mopping-up operations, Wuzhi also entered a comprehensive and active struggle to protect the wheat harvest. The armed work teams in all counties have gained experience in successfully combating mopping-up operations, and their confidence has been greatly increased, and their activities have become more active. On the 25th, at dawn, the armed work team of the Fifth District combined with a company of a certain unit and extended to the vicinity of the enemy stronghold in Encun, Jiaozuo, to conduct an ambush. They encountered Cao Baixing leading more than ten puppet self-defense soldiers, covering the escape to the landlords in Daiwang to loot wheat in Caopingling Village (seven miles south of the enemy stronghold in Daiwang). Our armed work team in the Fifth District launched a brave attack, chasing the enemy directly to the south of Daiwang Village, capturing one rifle and capturing seventeen landlords who were looting wheat. More than ten puppet self-defense soldiers from Mulandiang Village set out on the morning of the 26th to repair the road in Fucun and Pinggou in preparation for the passage of large trucks to facilitate grain looting. The armed work team of our Third District learned the news, and quickly rushed to repel the enemy, wounding two enemies. The enemy, with the return route cut off, turned south and fled across the Qin River in a panic. The armed work team of the Fourth District also extended into Fucheng Village, which belongs to Jiaozuo, to carry out guerrilla activities to protect the safe harvesting of the rear masses. At the same time, the explosion teams of the armed work teams in various districts are rushing to produce a large number of landmines, and are studying landmine warfare tactics day and night, and all have a high degree of confidence and determination to use landmines to block the enemy and combine雷枪 to annihilate the enemy.
    At present, "Protecting the wheat harvest and not letting the enemy take away a grain of wheat" has become the battle cry of the military and civilians south of Daokou-Qinghua Railway. Our guerrilla groups are rushing back and forth on the plains between Qinyang and Xiuwu, and the militia and armed work teams are adhering to activities in various regions. The enemy is frightened, and any grain looting plan will be defeated miserably.

　　豫北游击队护麦大出击
    蒋伪抢掠企图必遭惨败
    【本报讯】道清路南广大平原上的麦子已熟，道清路南游击集团纷纷出动，掩护正在开展的反倒算运动，保卫群众麦收。五月十日，武陟、焦作游击部队在府城设伏，以十分钟战斗全部歼灭伪自卫团二十余人，五月十九日在铁炉头（武陟属）活捉抢粮恶霸十余名，敌伪震惊万状。其他各处敌伪被击退者不下十余次，其中二十三日后董村（修武属）一仗，击退修武伪保安团二百余人进攻，毙伤敌十余，生俘四人，敌遗尸四具，狼狈窜回修武城，我仅轻伤二人。群众拍手称快，自动给部队送面送菜慰问。
    我部队除打仗外，还展开了群众性的宣传运动与帮助麦收运动。如马屯部队每到一处，宣传组即到处向群众进行宣传，化装宣传的秧歌队更不时出现街头；除警戒部队外，其他部队均有组织的出动帮助抗属及无劳力群众进行麦收。
    各地民兵武工队也积极活动，组织力量，保卫麦收，打击敌人。焦作一、二区杨（聚和）任（秀河）武工队，八天毙伤敌十五名。从五月二十一日早晨起，焦作外围据点上臼作、阎河等村伪“自卫团”及王封、李封、冯封的蒋军，带领着顽区的斗争对象、倒算头子、特务地主，每天都有一二百人，到我山地里来抢割麦子。我民兵武工队便起而积极掩护焦博公路两侧据点的麦收，焦作的前山——红沙岭和南寺岭，就变成敌我争夺的斗争焦点。二十一日至二十四日，在红沙岭、南寺岭、塔掌北山，进犯抢粮的敌伪连续遭我民兵武工队以地雷冷枪结合打击，共伤十四名。二十五日，李封伪自卫团两个排，带一百多民夫到司掌村抢麦子，窜到了罗圈掌村，将老百姓割到场里的麦子一火点着了。杨聚和民兵队一面打敌，一面救火。赵德禄同志的手巾袜子被火烧了，他说：“为了群众，烧了也光荣！”敌人没有一天不出来，杨聚和队摸着了敌人活动规律，了解了地形，测量了距离，组织了拉雷冷枪，于二十七日拂晓前，全队出击，主动设伏在红沙岭炮楼附近，上午十一点钟，敌人照常的由李封出来，上了高寨岭，一个排的伪自卫团，带两挺机枪，掩护着百十多个民夫来抢麦子了，分三路齐头前进，每一路都遭到我冷枪手的狙击，被打伤了好几个。分散的敌人这时都向五炮楼附近集中起来，继续进犯，被打倒了一个。当敌人踏进了拉雷火力圈里时，指挥拉雷的信号手榴弹响了，紧接着就是地雷的轰炸。敌人在烟雾里慌做一团，被炸倒了九个。这一次战斗打的好，使敌人的两挺机枪没有起了一点掩护作用（找不到我目标），没有抢割了麦子，反倒抬着三个重伤，扶架着四个轻伤败回去了。二十八日，上白作伪“自卫团”数十人的抢粮队，被一区民兵任秀河武工队打伤了三个。同日市武会在××村召开了边缘村的干部会议，交流了经验，情绪更高了。
    武陟于粉碎敌连续七天（五月十四——二十一日）之抢粮扫荡后，也进入全面的积极的保卫麦收斗争中。全县各区武工队，取得了胜利反扫荡的经验，信心更高，活动更主动积极。五区武工队于二十五日拂晓结合某部一个连，伸至焦作恩村敌据点附近，进行伏击，在曹平陵村（距待王敌据点南七里），遇曹柏兴带伪自卫团十余，掩护逃至待王之恶霸地主进行抢麦，我五区武工队勇猛冲击，将该敌直追至待王村南，缴步枪一支，俘抢麦之恶霸地主十七名。又木栾店之伪自卫团十余，于二十六日上午出发至傅村、平沟补路，以备通行大车，便利抢粮。我三区武工队得讯，迅即赶上去，将敌击退，伤敌二。敌以归路被截断，转而南向，狼狈渡沁河逃去。四区武工队亦伸入焦作属之附城村，进行游击活动，以掩护后方群众安全收割。同时各区武工队的爆炸组，正赶制大量地雷，并日夜研究地雷战术，均具有以地雷封锁敌人和雷枪结合歼敌的高度信心与决心。
    目前，“保卫麦收，不让敌人抢走一粒麦子”，已经变成为道清路南军民的战斗口号，我游击集团往来奔驰于沁阳至修武间的平原上，民兵武工队坚持各地区活动，敌人惊魂丧胆，任何抢粮计划都将遭到惨败。
