　　The Balkans, Past and Present
    Li Batov

    As a result of World War II, the countries of Southeastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Danube River basin, with the exception of Greece, have achieved complete independence and have embarked on the road of democratic reform. Major internal reforms are underway in these countries. In these countries, not long ago, there were monarchical autocracies and fascist dictatorships, and all democratic movements were severely suppressed. Now, the broad masses of the people have become the main force. Along with internal reforms, the foreign policies of the Balkan countries have also changed, and their international status has also undergone changes.

    To explain the essence of these changes, it is necessary to trace the historical roots of what made the Balkans the "powder keg of Europe." It is incorrect to regard all the historical twists and turns that have formed before our eyes as accidental and unexpected phenomena. In fact, these current changes are the result of the long-term struggle of the Balkan people in recent decades, beginning with their struggle against the shackles of Turkey, and then against the so-called "partition of the Balkans" policies implemented by the great powers. ...

    The struggle among the great powers for the Balkans was aimed at pursuing strategic strongholds. Initially, it was mainly about the struggle for the rule of the Dardanelles and the control of collapsing Turkey. ...

    The struggle among the great powers for spheres of influence caused countless "small wars," such as the Bulgarian-Serbian War of 1885 or the Turkish-Greek War. In the meantime, Britain played a particularly active role. ...

    Since the emergence of German imperialism on the international stage, with its highly developed industry and powerful army, the balance of power among the great powers in the Balkans was broken. At this time, the issue was not only about the Dardanelles and Turkey, but first and foremost about controlling the shortest land route from Europe to the treasure trove of the Middle East. Germany's plan to build the Berlin-Baghdad Railway (the so-called 3B Railway) was regarded by Britain as a direct threat to the British Empire's communications (mainly the route through the Suez Canal). This was particularly evident in 1912 during the First Balkan War. This war liberated the Balkan Peninsula from the shackles of Turkey, and also reflected the struggle among the great powers. The Balkan League was supported by Britain, Russia, France, and Italy; Turkey was supported by Germany, Austria, and Hungary.

    The defeat of Turkey and its withdrawal from the Balkan Peninsula disrupted Germany's colonial plans. German imperialists could not tolerate the established status quo, and under the patronage of their agent on the Bulgarian throne, Emperor Ferdinand, they provoked the Second Balkan War. But even this time, Germany gained nothing. As a result of this adventure, Bulgaria suffered defeat and signed the harsh Treaty of Bucharest. At that time, Germany was struggling to maintain its position in the Balkans, and then decided to incite Austria-Hungary's ambitions for aggression against the Balkans, first against Serbia. This was the prelude to World War I.

    Germany's defeat in World War I led to the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the strengthening of France's power in the Balkans and the Danube River basin. But this power was unstable. France's short-term "political" loans and insignificant investments could not weaken the serious consequences of the outbreak of the agricultural crisis in other investing countries of Southeast Europe.

    First Britain, and then Germany, took advantage of the crisis situation in the Balkan and Danube countries. On the one hand, there was an agricultural crisis, and on the other hand, the Southeast European countries were eager for industrialization. Under these circumstances, Britain and Germany relied on investment and the development of commercial ties to achieve political subjugation of these countries. In this situation, industrialization was already implemented, along with its colonial nature. Industrialization was mainly limited to the extraction of certain war resources, such as oil and iron ore.

    No matter how limited the industrial development of the Balkan countries was, it ultimately promoted the growth of the working class and the democratic movement, and strengthened the struggle against the reactionary, traitorous ruling groups, especially in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, because the people of these two countries suffered the most from the imperialist "partition of the Balkans" policy, national persecution, and the semi-colonial system.

    The Soviet Revolution in Russia was a great impetus to the anti-imperialist and democratic struggle of the people of Southeast Europe. The growth and development of the Soviet Union ignited the Balkan people's yearning for a better future. The broad popular movements that were beginning in some Balkan countries during World War I were submerged in blood by the reactionaries who relied on foreign intervention. But these events remained deeply in the memory of the broad masses of the people.

    But during this period, the Balkan countries, as before, were still a battlefield for imperialist competition. In the 1920s, Britain used the national contradictions between the victorious and defeated countries of Southeast Europe to squeeze out France's position. At the turn of the 1930s, German imperialism, which was rearming, began to rapidly strengthen. At this time, the most prominent contradiction in the Balkans was not the contradiction between Britain and France, but the contradiction between Britain and Germany. Britain gradually seized France's position in the Balkans. France's satellites also abandoned France and turned to Britain. At the same time, Germany's claws also stretched into the Balkans. On the one hand, Britain tried its best to build fortresses to prevent Germany from expanding to the Near East and the heart of the British Empire, and on the other hand, it tried its best to direct the edge of German aggression towards anti-Sovietism.

    Both of these plans failed. At the beginning of World War II, Britain was unable to prevent Germany from seizing the Balkans. Germany brought Romania and Bulgaria to its side, seized Greece and Yugoslavia, and obtained the goodwill "neutrality" of Turkey, which was allied with Britain.

    Controlling the Balkans could not guarantee Germany's southern flank in the anti-Soviet war, and it also violated the vital interests of the British Empire. The United States was also harmed, because before the war began, Germany had already reached out to the Balkans, the eastern part of the Mediterranean, the Near East, and North Africa.

    Because Britain could not prevent Germany from entering the Balkans, Germany was able to use its cheap victories over the small Balkan countries to realize its criminal plans. The Soviet Union and the Balkan peoples' own liberation movements prevented it. The People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia, as well as the People's Liberation Army of Albania, the armed forces of the Greek People's Liberation Movement, and the Bulgarian guerrillas played a significant role.

    The Red Army's approach to the Danube River in the autumn of 1944 provided strong support for the Balkan people in their liberation from the shackles of German fascism and the expulsion of German aggressors.

    The crushing of German imperialism in World War II created a new situation in the Balkans. The people of the Balkan countries entered a new stage in their liberation struggle, the direct purpose of which was to create such conditions; under these conditions, it would be impossible to turn back, and no longer allow the Balkans and its people to be used as toys in the struggle for imperialist interests.

    Since the Balkan countries (except Greece, where British troops are supporting the reactionaries) drove out the German occupiers, the fascist system has been eliminated and a democratic system has been established. The National Liberation Committee of Yugoslavia was transformed into the Provisional Government of Yugoslavia. In Bulgaria, the people established the government of the Fatherland Front. Albania, which had been under the shackles of Italy for decades, and then under the iron heel of German fascism, has now gained independent, democratic management and a democratic government. In Romania, the government of the National Democratic Front has been established. In the above countries, management has been transferred to the hands of certain political parties and individuals, who have gained the trust of the people for their merits in the struggle for the national independence of their countries and the expulsion of German occupiers.

    The victory of democracy has ended the Balkan countries' semi-colonial dependence on imperialist powers and their "partition of the Balkans policy." This construction relies on the broadest masses of democracy and is realized by the hands of the laboring classes of the residents - workers, peasants, and representatives of intellectuals.

    The democratization of the domestic political structure in some Balkan countries has created the preconditions for eradicating infighting and hostility. With the possibility of independently determining relations with each other and with other countries, the Balkan people strive to establish such relations on the basis of friendship and cooperation. On the other hand, the practical implementation of democratic principles guarantees the rational solution of national problems for the first time in history. This opens up the prospect of lasting peace and cooperation among the people. In this part of Europe, the seeds of national discord sown by foreign imperialists have never stopped, and the Balkans have been the source of international disputes for many years.

    The establishment of a democratic system and the liberation from semi-colonial dependence have created the most favorable conditions for the economic recovery of the Balkan and Danube River basin countries destroyed by the Hitler gang, for their industrialization and for a more free and normal development of the national economy.

    The democratic land reform eliminated feudal remnants and solved the agricultural problem, which was one of the weakest and most acute problems in this part of Europe.

    The economic progress of the Balkan countries will undoubtedly have a beneficial impact on the economic situation of the entire Europe. But there are also artificial obstacles, which are created by the Anglo-Saxon countries (referring to Britain and the United States - translator) ruling groups who do not want the Balkan countries to be independent and try to turn back the wheels of history.

    For example, these groups are trying to control the navigation rights of the Danube River, controlling this important waterway artery in Southeast Europe. Before the war, this control was actually in the hands of non-Danube countries - Britain, France, and Italy, and was implemented through the so-called Danube River Commission. Now, some non-Danube countries, past participants in the commission, want to return to the previous state under the pretext of "internationalizing" the Danube River and stipulating "freedom of navigation." This only shows the desire to encroach on the sovereignty and internal affairs of the Balkan countries. Undoubtedly, the Balkan countries can independently solve the issue of Danube River navigation rights without foreign interference.

    Wanting to interfere in the internal affairs of individual countries in Southeast Europe and continue the "partition of the Balkans policy" in new forms is not only manifested in the issue of Danube River navigation rights.

    We see that the development and consolidation of democracy in the Balkans does not receive sympathy from the ruling groups in Britain and the United States. On the contrary, the Anglo-Saxon countries' policy towards the Balkan democratic governments cannot but arouse indignation and suspicion from the democratic public opinion in these countries. Everyone knows that their policy is to support those old, bankrupt representatives who are carrying out destructive work against democratic reforms. The Anglo-Saxon ruling groups are also encouraging those Balkan reactionary forces who are waving pseudo-democratic banners, supporting secret and open fascists, and attempting to restore the old order in the Balkans.

    The international reactionaries undoubtedly hope to put their agents in power in the newly liberated countries of the Balkan Peninsula. It is best to let the facts speak for themselves about this.

    This policy is especially implemented towards democratic Albania. The country's opposite shore controls the Strait of Otranto, which is a narrow passage between the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, and has always been a springboard for invading the Balkans. The Greek fascists demanded to rule Albania and also wanted them to provoke border incidents and attack Albanian territory. These provocative aggressions became more obvious afterwards, because Britain severed relations with Albania under the pretext of "Albania's unfriendly behavior," and Greece's memorandum on dividing southern Albania, according to Reuters, has been "accepted in principle" by London.

    The Anglo-Saxon countries' policy towards democratic Yugoslavia carries a publicly unfriendly nature, which can be testified by the official documents of Yugoslavia. Britain and the United States recently sent an ultimatum to Yugoslavia, accusing him of withdrawing the representatives of the Allied Boundary Commission of the Julian border in the British-occupied area. However, in fact, the withdrawal of the German representatives was after the British military authorities shielded the provocative activities of the fascists, whose intention was to oppose the residents of Slovenia, and even the Yugoslav members of the commission.

    The British and American governments have sent ultimatums to the Bulgarian government several times, the purpose of which is obviously to support the reactionary and fascist elements in the country.

    The same policy is implemented towards Romania.

    The British and American ultimatum to Romania put forward unreasonable demands, that is, their "historical" parties participate in national management.

    Based on the forged information of these parties, Britain and the United States put forward objections to all measures of Romania's national democratization, and are unwilling to recognize its independent decision on the date of the parliamentary elections. It is well known that Romania originally planned to hold elections at the end of August or the beginning of September, that is, as soon as the war ended.

    Furthermore, in Hungary, the narrow patriotism and hatred were ignited by the false information spread by the British newspapers or radio about the position taken by individual great powers on the issue of the status of Hungarians in Slovakia, especially in German Speyer, obviously intended to undermine the democratic cooperation of the people of Southeast Europe.

    The reactionary newspapers of the Anglo-Saxon countries used the slander against the Soviet Union's policy as a smokescreen to cover up their conspiracy in the Balkans. The Soviet Union's loyal and friendly policy towards the Balkan people is extremely displeasing to the traitorous reactionaries. The Anglo-Saxon countries have frequently sent their agents to the Balkans, trying to undermine these countries' young democratic systems.

    In the activities of the reactionary groups in the Balkan countries, we see the resonance of all the "partition of the Balkans policies" and policies of provoking internal and external wars. It is only now that this policy has hit a snag, because a solid foundation has been established in the Balkans for the further development of internal democracy and close cooperation in the Balkan countries.

　　巴尔干的今昔
    李巴托夫
    由于第二次世界大战的结果，东南欧国家、巴尔干和多瑙河流域的国家，除了希腊，都已取得了完全的独立而开始向着民主改革的大道迈进。在这些国家里正在进行着重大的内政改革。在这些国家里不久以前还存在着君主专制政体和法西斯专政，一切民主运动备受摧残，而现在广大人民群众却成了主要的力量。与内政改革相连，巴尔干国家的对外政策也有所改变，其国际地位也起了变化。
    为了说明这些改变的实质，必须追溯所以使巴尔干成为“欧洲火药库”的历史根源。把我们眼前所形成的历史曲折一概视为偶然的和意外的现象，这是不正确的。实际上，目前的这些改变是巴尔干人民在近几十年长期斗争的结果，开始他们为反对土耳其的羁绊而斗争，而后又反对各列强所施行的所谓“分割巴尔干”的政策。………
    各列强争夺巴尔干的斗争，其目的是追逐战略支点。开始时主要是争夺达达尼尔的统治权和争夺控制走向崩溃的土耳其。……
    各列强争夺势力范围的斗争引起无数的“小的战争”，一八八五年的保加利亚——塞尔维亚战争或土耳其——希腊的战争都可作为例证。在这中间，英国尤其起了积极的作用。……
    自从国际舞台上出现了德国帝国主义，它有高度发展的工业和强大的陆军，于是就破坏了各列强在巴尔干的力量之平衡，这时问题已不仅是关于达达尼尔和土耳其，而且首先是关于控制由欧洲到达中东宝库的最短陆路问题。德国构筑柏林——巴格达（阿拉伯半岛北部，伊拉克的首都）铁路（即所谓三Ｂ铁路）的计划在英国视为是对不列颠帝国交通（主要是经过苏彝士运河的航路）的直接威胁。一九一二年当第一次巴尔干战争时这点暴露得特别明显。这一次战争使巴尔干半岛从土耳其的羁绊下解放出来，同时也反映出诸列强之间的斗争，支持巴尔干联盟的是英、俄、法、意；支持土耳其的是德、奥、匈。
    土耳其的失败及其退出巴尔干半岛破坏了德国的殖民地计划。德国帝国主义者不堪忍受既成的现状，在其保加利亚王座的代理人——费丁兰皇帝的赞助之下，又挑起了第二次的巴尔干战争。但就在这一次，德国也仍无所获。由于这次的冒险，保加利亚遭受失败而签订了苛刻的布哈列斯特和约。当时在这艰难维持其在巴尔干的地位，于是决定煽动奥、匈对于巴尔干的侵略野心，首先反对塞尔维亚。这就是第一次世界大战的前奏曲。
    德国在第一次世界大战中的失败引起奥、匈崩溃和法国在巴尔干和多瑙河流域势力的加强。可是这种势力是不稳固的。法国短期的“政治”借款和微不足道的投资都不能减弱东南欧其他投资国家暴发的农业危机的严重结果。
    先是英国，而后是德国利用了巴尔干和多瑙河国家的危机状况。一方面是农业危机，同时东南欧国家渴求工业化，在这种情况之下，英国和德国靠着投资和发展商业连系而达到使这些国家在政治上屈服。在这种情形之下，已实行的工业化及其殖民地的性质。工业化主要只限于某些战争资源，如石油、铁矿土的采掘。
    巴尔干国家的工业发展不管怎样受限制，然而它终归推进了工人阶级和民主运动的增涨和加强了反对反动的、卖国的统治集团的斗争，在保加利亚和南斯拉夫特别显著，因为这两个国家的人民感受帝国主义“分割巴尔干”政策、民族迫害、半殖民地制度的痛苦最大。
    俄国的苏维埃革命对于东南欧各国人民的反帝和民主斗争是一个很大的推动力。苏联的生长和发展燃起了巴尔干国家人民憧憬美好的将来。第一次世界大战在某些巴尔干国家中正在开始的广大人民的运动都被那些依仗外国干涉者的反动派淹没在血海中。可是这些事件深深留在广大人民的记忆里。
    但是在这时期，巴尔干国家和以前一样，仍是帝国主义者角逐的战场。在二十年代英国曾利用东南欧的战胜国与战败国之间的民族矛盾来排挤法国的地位，在三十年代关头，重整武装的德国帝国主义，开始迅速强化，这时在巴尔干最突出的不是英法矛盾，而是英德矛盾。英国逐渐夺取了法国在巴尔干的地位。法国的卫星及也都弃法而向英。同时德国的魔爪也伸进了巴尔干。英国一方面竭力筑构防寨阻止德国向近东，向不列颠帝国的心脏膨胀，同时又极力把德国侵略的锋芒引向反苏。
    这两个计划都失败了。在第二次世界大战开始时，英国无力阻止德国夺取巴尔干。德国把罗马尼亚和保加利亚拉为自己方面去，夺取了希腊和南斯拉夫并且获得了与英国联盟的土耳其的善意的“中立”。
    控制了巴尔干这块地盘不能保证德国在反苏战争中的南翼，而且触犯了不列颠帝国的切身利益，美国也受其害，因为在战争开始前德国已经伸手于巴尔干、地中海的东部地区、近东和北非。
    因为英国不能阻止德国进入巴尔干，所以德国便能利用自己对于小的巴尔干国家的便宜的胜利来实现其犯罪的计划。苏联和巴尔干人民自身的解放运动却阻止了它。南斯拉夫人民解放军，以及阿尔巴尼亚人民解放军，希腊的人民解放运动的武装力量和保加利亚游击队都起了显著的作用。
    红军在一九四四年秋天迫近多瑙河，对于巴尔干人民在其解脱德国法西斯的羁绊和驱逐德国侵略者给予有力的支援。
    在第二次世界大战中德国帝国主义的粉碎，在巴尔干造成了新的情况。巴尔干国家的民众进入了自己解放斗争的新阶段，解放斗争的直接目的就是要造成这样的条件；在这种条件之下不可能再走回头路，不再让巴尔干及其人民在帝国主义利益的斗争中被当作玩具。
    自从巴尔干国家（希腊除外，英国军队正在那里支持反动派）赶走了德国占领者以后，法西斯制度是破消灭了，民主制度已经确立了。南斯拉夫的民族解放委员会变成为南斯拉夫的临时政府。在保加利亚人民建立了祖国阵线的政府。阿尔巴尼亚几十年来一直处在意大利的羁绊之下，后来又在德国法西斯的铁蹄之下，而现在已获得独立、民主管理和民主政府。在罗马尼亚建立了民族民主阵线的政府。在以上这些国家中管理已转入某些政党和个人之手，这些政党和个人都是在争取自己国家的民族独立和驱逐德国占领者的斗争有功绩而取得了人民的信任。
    民主的胜利结束了巴尔干国家对帝国主义列强及其“分割巴尔干政策”的半殖民地的依赖。这一建设依靠着民主的最广泛的群众而由居民的劳动阶层——工人、农民、知识分子的代表的手来实现。
    在巴尔干某些国家内国内政治构造的民主化造成了根绝彼此倾轧和敌视的前提。由于有了可能独立确定彼此的关系和与其他国家的关系，巴尔干人民力求在友谊和合作的基础上建立这种关系。另一方面，民主原则的实际实现在历史上首次保证民族问题的合理解决。由此展开了永久和平和人民之间的合作的远景。本来在欧洲的这一部分从来都没有停止过外国帝国主义者散播的民族不和的种子，在巴尔干多少年来都是国际纠纷的策源地。
    民主制度的确立和解脱半殖民地的依属对于被希特勒匪帮所破坏的巴尔干和多瑙河流域国家的经济恢复，对于他们的工业化和更自由更正常的发展国民经济造成了最有利的条件。
    民主的土地改革消灭了封建残余，使农业问题得到解决，在欧洲的这一部分，农业问题曾是最弱而又最尖锐的问题之一。
    巴尔干国家的经济进步，无疑的对于整个欧洲的经济状况发生了有益的影响。可是也还存在着人为的障碍，这是那些不愿巴尔干国家独立和力图扭转历史车轮的盎格洛撒克逊国家（指英、美——译者）当权集团所造成的。
    举例来说，这些集团试图控制多瑙河的航权，控制东南欧的这条重要的水道大动脉。战前这个控制实际上是在非多瑙河国家——英、法、意之手，而通过所谓多瑙河委员会来执行。现在某些非多瑙河国家、过去的委员会的参加者，想在多瑙河“国际化”和规定“航行自由”的借口之下回到以前的状态。这不过表明想侵夺主权和巴尔干国家的内政，无疑的巴尔干国家不用外国干涉，就能独立地解决多瑙河的航权问题。
    想要干涉东南欧个别国家的内政和以新的形式继续“分割巴尔干政策”不仅表现在多瑙河航权问题上。
    我们看到，巴尔干民主的发展和巩固在英美的统治集团中是得不到同情的。相反的，盎格洛撒克逊国家对待巴尔干民主政府的政策不能不使这些国家的民主舆论发生愤慨和怀疑。谁也知道，他们的政策是支持那些进行反对民主改革的破坏工作的旧时的、破产了的残余代表，盎格洛撒克逊的当权集团还在鼓励那些打着伪民主招牌的巴尔干反动力量，支持秘密的和公开的法西斯分子，企图在巴尔干恢复旧的秩序。
    国际反动派无疑的指望在巴尔干半岛的新解放国家把自己的代理人扶上政权。关于这个最好让事实来说明。
    对于民主的阿尔巴尼亚特别施行这一政策。该国的对岸控制着俄特兰陀海峡，这是亚得里亚海与地中海的孔迫，历来都是侵入巴尔干的跳板。希腊的法西斯分子要求统治阿尔巴尼亚也想要他们挑起国境事件和袭击阿尔巴尼亚的领土。这些挑衅的侵略性往后更看得明显，因为英国在“阿尔巴尼亚的不友善行为”的借口之下与阿尔巴尼亚绝交，希腊关于分割阿尔巴尼亚南部的备忘录，据路透社报导，已为伦敦的“示意接受”。
    盎格洛撒克的国家对待民主的南斯拉夫的政策带着公开不友善的性质，南斯拉夫的官方文件可以作证。英美最近曾以通牒致送南斯拉夫，责备他撤退英占区的朱理边界联合委员会的代表。然而事实上德国代表的撤退是在英国军事当局袒护法西斯分子的挑衅活动之后，这些活动的意图是在反对斯洛文尼亚的居民，甚至反对委员会中的南斯拉夫委员。
    英美政府数次向保加利亚政府致送通牒，其目的显然是想支持该国的反动分子和法西斯分子。
    对罗马尼亚也执行同样的政策。
    英美致送罗国的通牒提出毫无理由的要求，即其他们大“历史”的政党参加国家管理。
    根据着这些政党的伪造情报，英美就提出反对罗马尼亚的国家民主化的一切措施，并且不愿承认其独立决定国会选举的日期，众所周知，罗国原定于八月底或九月初，即战争一结束以后便进行选举。
    再说匈牙利，靠着英国报纸或无线电所散播的关于匈牙利人在斯洛伐克，特别是在德国斯斐尼亚的地位问题上个别大国所取立场的伪情报燃起了狭隘的爱国主义的仇恨，显然意在破坏东南欧国家人民的民主合作。
    盎格洛撒克逊国家的反动报纸以对苏联政策的造谣中伤作烟幕来掩盖其在巴尔干的阴谋。苏联的忠实而友善对待巴尔干人民的政策，卖国的反动派是极不高兴的。盎格洛撒克逊国家遂经常向巴尔干派遣他们的代理人，试图破坏这些国家的年轻的民主制度。
    在巴尔干国家的反动集团的活动里我们看到了一切“分割巴尔干政策”、挑起内外战争的政策的共鸣。只是在现在这个政策才碰了钉子，因为在巴尔干已建立了更进一步发展巴尔干国家的内部民主和紧密合作的坚实基础。（Ｔ·Ｙ·译自苏联新时代杂志一九四六年第十二期）（附图片）
