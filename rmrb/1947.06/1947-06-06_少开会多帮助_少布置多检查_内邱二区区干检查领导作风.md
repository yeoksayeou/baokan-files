    Neiqiu Second District Cadres Examine Leadership Style
    [Our Newspaper, Neiqiu News] The Second District, at its expanded cadre meeting from the 20th to the 22nd of last month, reviewed and settled accounts regarding leadership style. From everyone's reports and self-criticisms, everyone felt the following situations should be noted: (1) During the production season, the meeting leadership methods of the land reform movement were still being carried over. Some cadres believed: "Without meetings, there is no leadership; without passing things through meetings, work cannot be started." This led to a phenomenon of too many meetings and chaotic meetings, causing the masses to develop a weary and greasy attitude towards meetings. Too many meetings were counterproductive. For example, in Zhongcheng Village, every small matter and small problem had to be resolved in a large meeting at a mass meeting. For example, in Dongpang, two people arguing had to be resolved at a mass meeting, forming a phenomenon of too many large meetings without a central focus. (2) Some cadres still have a tendency to take over and do everything themselves, creating a phenomenon of "cadres are here, work is here; cadres leave, work leaves." The ability of village cadres cannot be improved, and the work in the village is not consolidated. (3) Some cadres believe that after the masses have turned over, their level of awareness has increased, so everything is left to the masses to solve, directly abandoning leadership. (4) The leadership above the district level is not sound. Some have a "grabbing everything" style. Cadres from various departments can casually convene a district-wide village cadre meeting, and even filling out a form requires convening a large meeting to assign it, causing village cadres to waste too much work time and become weary and exhausted in their work. After everyone settled accounts with these problems, it was decided: 1. Meetings should be reduced during the production season, especially mass meetings. Necessary meetings should be held, but preparations should be made in advance, with a central focus and content, to reduce meeting time. Village meetings must be approved by the production committee and must not disrupt the village's meeting system. When necessary, participate in various regular meetings to help with planning and research. 2. The district should establish unified leadership, overcome the tendency of various departments to convene village cadre meetings casually without notification. Each village should establish unified core leadership and establish and improve the production committee to unify leadership and promote the production work of the entire village. 3. In terms of leadership methods, it is necessary to frequently assign tasks, assign fewer tasks, frequently supervise, and frequently inspect based on the situation of each period. 4. Overcome running errands blindly and the style of taking over and doing everything; cadres must go deeper to create experience and promote the general situation. Cadres must personally participate in production mutual aid teams, frequently discover problems, and understand the situation in order to gain experience. Finally, in order to inspire the active factors of each comrade, and carry out the New Heroism competition, it was decided to carry out a merit-making movement in the great production movement, and put forward the slogan: "Accumulate small merits into great merits, everyone must make merit." The specific standards for making merit were determined to be: 1. Seeking truth from facts, understanding the true situation, and serving the masses; 2. Good ideological leadership and good completion of tasks; 3. Following the mass line, democratic style, being one with the masses, and being supported by the masses; 4. Working diligently, with new creations and significant achievements; 5. Working hard and practicing production thrift to play an exemplary role; 6. Being able to lead and manage a model mutual aid team; 7. Being able to patiently persuade and educate those who are backward to consciously and voluntarily participate in production. Finally, a merit evaluation committee was selected to discuss specific methods for calculating and evaluating merit. After everyone had deliberated on them, the merit evaluation committee would evaluate and calculate the merits, and praise and reward them regularly and promptly. (Zi Qi)

　　少开会多帮助
    少布置多检查
    内邱二区区干检查领导作风
    【本报内邱讯】二区于上月二十日至二十二日的干部扩大会议上，检讨清算领导作风，从大家的汇报与检讨中，大家认为有以下几种情况应注意：（一）在生产季节中仍搬运土地改革运动中的会议领导方法，有些干部认为：“不开会就没有领导，不通过会议，工作就没法下手。”以致形成会议多会议乱的现象，群众产生了厌会油腻的情绪。会议太多，反而不起作用，如中程村一点事一个小问题也要开大会在群众会上来解决，如东庞二个群众吵嘴纠纷也要在群众会上解决，形成大会多，会议没中心的现象。（二）部分干部还存在着包办代替作风，形成“干部在，工作在，干部走，工作走”的现象。村干部能力提不高，村中工作也不巩固。（三）有些干部认为群众翻身后觉悟程度提高了，一切叫群众来解决而直接放弃领导。（四）区领导上的一领导不健全，有的抓一把的作风，各部门干部，可以随便召集一个全区村干大会，填一个表子也要召集一个大会来布置，使村干部误工太多，在工作上油腻疲惫。大家清算了这些问题后，决定：１、生产季节中会议要减少，特别是群众会要少开，必要会要开，但事前要准备好，有中心、有内容，减少会议时间，开村的会须通过生产委员会，不可打乱村中会议制度。必要时可参加各种定期会议，帮助计划研究。２、区建立统一领导，克服各部门随便不通知召开村干部会的偏向，各村要建立统一的核心领导，成立与健全生产委员会，统一领导推动全村生产工作。３、在领导方法上，要根据每个时期的情况，勤布置，少布置，勤督促，勤检查。４、克服跑腿主义，与包办代替作风；干部要深入一点创造经验，推动一般。干部要亲身参加到生产互助组内去，经常发现问题，了解情况，才能取得经验。最后大家为了启发每个同志的积极因素，开展新英雄主义竞赛，决定开展大生产运动中的立功运动，提出：“集小功为大功，人人都要立功，”的口号。具体的立功标准，决定为：一、实事求是了解真实情况为群众服务；二、思想领导好，任务完成好；三、群众路线民主作风，与群众打成一片，为群众所拥护者；四、工作踏实有新的创造，有显著成绩；五、工作艰苦生产节约起模范作用者；六、能领导搞好一个模范互助组；七、能耐心说服教育落后，自觉自愿参加劳动生产者。最后选出评功委员会，讨论出具体计功评功办法，先经大家酝酿，酝酿成熟，由评功委员会评功计功，要经常并及时表扬奖励。（子琦）
