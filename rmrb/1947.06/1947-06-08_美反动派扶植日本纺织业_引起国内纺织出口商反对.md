　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd. American reactionaries are supporting the Japanese textile industry, which has aroused opposition from the American Textile Exporters Association. According to New York: The American Textile Exporters Association recently expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. government's support for the Japanese textile industry, believing that U.S. money or technical experts should not be used to rebuild Japanese textile factories. It also advocated that special regulations should be imposed on the Japanese textile industry to prevent it from restoring its pre-war first-class status and participating in textile industry competition.
