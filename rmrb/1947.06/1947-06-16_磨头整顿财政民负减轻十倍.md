Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd: Motou Town in Shen County, Jizhong, has reduced the burden on the masses by more than ten times in three months after village financial rectification. Before the rectification, arbitrary expenditures and waste in the village were extremely serious, and village levies even exceeded the consolidated tax burden. For example, in order to restore the temple fair and stage old operas, more than 3,000 jin of wheat were raised from the villagers, and another 2,000 jin of millet were raised to obtain costumes from Beiping. Inspections by the militia, women, and self-defense teams, and eating and drinking at cadre meetings were paid for by the village. The village finance committee members were not responsible for mastering the system and approved reimbursements at will. After inspection, it was decided that village expenditures should resolutely implement the system, strictly controlled and managed by the village head and finance committee members. Office expenses of each system in the village are strictly separated, and reimbursed within the system. Cadres bring their own two days of food to meetings, and if they exceed this, the village grain will be used to cover the excess, deducting the two days included in the original notice. Before the rectification, each share of village funds required a burden of 24 jin, but after calculating three months of expenses after the rectification, each share only requires a burden of 2.2 jin. The village has now become a model for implementing the system in the district and has been rewarded.

　　磨头整顿财政民负减轻十倍
    【新华社晋察冀三日电】冀中深县磨头镇，经村财政整理，三个月群众负担减轻十倍以上。整理前，村中任意开支，浪费极为严重，村款摊派竟超过统累税负担。如为恢复庙会唱旧戏，竟向村民募集小麦三千余斤，往北平办戏衣又募集小米二千余斤。民兵妇女自卫队检阅，干部开会，吃喝由村开支。村财政委员，不负责掌握制度，随便予以报销经检查后，决定村中开支坚决贯彻制度，由村长与财政委员严格掌握管理，村中各系统办公费严格分开，在制度内实报实销。干部开会自带两天粮食，超过者，始由村粮中开支，按通知天数扣除两天报销。整理前，村款一项每份须负担廿四斤，整理后三个月开支计算，每分仅须负担二点二斤。现该村已成为该区执行制度的模范，获得奖励。
