　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Shanghai News: Mr. Li Jishen recently met with a reporter from the China Business Daily in Hong Kong and commented on the current student movement. Mr. Li said: "Young people are protesting hunger and civil war through strikes and demonstrations, and many young people have shed blood. All people with conscience should sympathize with them... This proves that the vast majority of intellectuals have a conscience." When asked how hunger threatens the entire country, Mr. Li said: This is all caused by "the reactionary ruling group's policy of unification by force."

　　李济琛氏同情学运
    【新华社陕北四日电】沪息：李济琛氏顷于香港接见华商报记者，对目前学运有所评论。李氏称：“青年们正以罢课、游行等抗议饥饿和内战，许多青年已流了鲜血。一切有良心的人都应予以同情。……此事证明知识分子中有良心者占绝大多数。”李氏于回答如何饥饿威胁全国时称：这都是“反动统治集团实行的武力统一政策”所招致的。
