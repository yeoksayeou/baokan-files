　　Qibin Guerrilla Warfare
    Li Linzeng
    When the enemy entered southwestern Shandong, we completely withdrew from the Qibin area. Before returning, some cadres ideologically emphasized that the Chiang army had landlords as its social base, exaggerating the strength of the Chiang army and neglecting our eight years of anti-Japanese strength and experience. They failed to see the increased awareness of the masses and the broad democratic social foundation. As a result, the thought of fearing the enemy and waiting for the main force to conquer the world before returning to resume work arose. The reactionary forces took the opportunity to seize grain and kill the masses, destroying our rural work. At this time, the cadres developed the idea of revenge, but only carried out the elimination of traitors, without the determination to persevere. After the enemy's bluster passed, the masses could not bear the Chiang army's burning, killing, and raping, and longed for us to return to lead them, so they sent letters and messages to us before we entered, asking us to go, which also increased the cadres' confidence. After the cadres recognized the favorable conditions for fighting behind enemy lines, they correctly analyzed the strength of the enemy and ourselves, and clarified that "if the area can persevere, it is because we are not persevering." After returning, the understanding of the policy of eliminating traitors was not clear at first, and the masses complained to us, saying: "The leniency is boundless." We accepted the opinions of the masses, relied on the public appraisal, resolutely and vigorously supported the masses, and consolidated the rural base.

    When we first returned, the militiamen and district cadres liked to concentrate on fighting tough battles and big battles, blindly and stubbornly. For example, when five hundred enemies from Dingtao arrived at Maji, and our militiamen and district cadre teams were less than twenty people, they pounced on the enemy fiercely in the daytime and fought fiercely for an hour. The enemy retreated, but we pursued, which caused the enemy to see a flaw and counterattack us with five heavy machine guns and three light machine guns. Fortunately, the outer militiamen arrived in time, and the enemy retreated. Although our militiamen did not injure anyone, they consumed eight hundred rounds of ammunition. During this period, our leadership thinking was the old set of ideas, unable to change with the enemy's changes, our method of struggle was "sleep if you don't fight," relaxing political leadership. After a long period of education and bloody lessons, we realized that we should not fight annihilation battles, because the future supply of weapons and ammunition would be a problem. It has been much better since this spring. For example, in April, the 428th Regiment of the 143rd Brigade of the enemy "mopped up" my Zhuanmiao Market. Our outer line attacked the Cao Ding Highway, south of Wangdian. Thirty enemies carrying a machine gun engaged in a fierce battle with forty members of the district cadre team and militiamen, holding each other in the ditches on both sides of the highway. If it were last year, we would have rushed over in one go; but this time, under the command of comrades such as Hou Baotai, a mobile unit was dispatched to the enemy's flank, and charged fiercely at the same time as the front. The enemy was routed. A company commander and a squad leader of the enemy were captured, and two enemy soldiers were killed and three were wounded. We captured a box gun and 90,000 yuan of Chiang currency. We suffered no casualties. On the way back, we also destroyed two and a half miles of telegraph wires.

    Our militiamen do not separate from production, but only cooperate with the district cadre team to mobilize and concentrate to attack the enemy. Usually they are with the masses, establishing mass intelligence, etc., extending into the border area. The masses often monitor the enemy, and the enemy's movements are immediately spread throughout the area.

    Our party, government, army, and people are all armed in various small areas, working while fighting. In order to persist in the position, fighting without leaving the district or the village, the district cadre team, the militiamen, and all departments have their own combat secret caves, which are combined with the village caves. When the enemy comes, they fight if they can, and hide in the caves if they can't, and immediately come out to pursue the enemy or suppress the bad elements after the enemy has passed. In short, the enemy cannot disrupt our work. Comrade Fan Lianzhu of × Village led the militiamen to ambush the enemy's rearguard troops before the enemy troops had completely left, killing one person, capturing two alive, and obtaining two guns. When the enemy's large force returned, they had already drilled into the secret cave. When × District started digging tunnels, the cadres' thinking was also blocked, "the geology is not good," "the masses are unwilling to dig." The leadership emphasized that "digging tunnels is the only way to persist in the position struggle, digging tunnels is to protect the village and save lives." For the masses, administrative orders were combined with political mobilization. A general call was made to break through key points, and the leadership personally took action to create experience and broadcast it in a timely manner. Everyone's confidence was higher after hiding from the enemy once, and then a reasonable division of labor was made, rewards and punishments were clearly defined, and competitions were launched. The thoughts of the masses and cadres were all connected, and they dug secret caves and branches, and dug main lines. The branches were dug by the village, and the main lines had external support. The branches and main lines helped each other and were connected, and expanded to the border area. The enemy hated our tunnels very much and tried every means to destroy them. In the past, they discovered that they were destroying our main lines, blocking the entrances, or burning smoke to smoke the entrances, but the smoke could not enter. However, in the struggle, we also improved the combat equipment. Because the enemy can destroy it, mainly because there are traces on the ground, this point has now been overcome by the masses, and "caves under caves", "maze caves", and "ring caves" have been created, and "five eyes and three mouths" and "bright wells and dark wells" and other combat equipment have been installed, which is not purely defensive, but actively combines small armed forces to attack the enemy, using cold gun warfare to confuse the enemy, forcing the enemy not to dare to find caves recklessly. In the future, we also plan to dig landmines, which will cause the enemy to step on the new soil and be torn to pieces.

    When we first proposed to carry out land reform, we insisted on guerrilla warfare, combined with the cadres' thinking, first of all, we felt that the environment was special, and we used the excuse that the village organizations had all been changed and there was no experience. In fact, we were personally afraid of launching land distribution. We adopted different methods according to the different conditions in each district.

    The enemy has been "mopping up" since March of this year. The district held a meeting of village cadres and the poorest peasant associations, emphasizing only the laws and decrees, and it would not work if they were not implemented; but after returning to the village, good villages brewed, middle villages only mentioned a word of distribution, and backward villages simply did not hum. Later, the cadres went deep into the villages and learned that the masses were afraid of "Little Chiang," so they changed the work steps from small to large, starting with two or three people to discover activists, and slowly developing; later, they turned to struggle as the main focus, and the masses widely rose up to investigate floating wealth and divide fields, with men and women working together. Now, about three-quarters of the villages in this district are carrying out land reform.

　　齐滨游击战
    李临增
    我们在敌人进入鲁西南的时候，完全退出了齐滨区。在未回去以前，部分干部在思想上强调蒋军有地主作社会基础，过分夸大蒋军的力量，忽略了我们抗日八年的力量与经验，没看到群众觉悟的提高与广泛的民主社会基础，于是便发生怕敌人，等待主力打天下而后回去恢复工作的思想。而反动势力则乘机倒粮杀群众，破坏我们农村工作。这时干部产生了复仇的思想，但只是进行除奸，还没有坚持的决心。群众在敌人的风头过去，受不了蒋军的烧杀奸淫，渴望我们回去领导，因而在我们未进入前捎信传信要我们去，这也提高了干部的信心。干部在认识了打回敌后的有利条件后，又正确的分析了敌我的力量，明确了“地区能坚持，就是我们不坚持”。回去后，开始对除奸政策认识不明确，群众埋怨我们说：“宽大的没边了。”我们接受群众意见，依群众评议，坚决大力为群众撑腰，巩固农村阵地。
    在刚回去时，民兵和区干部都好集中打硬仗，打大仗，盲干硬干。如定陶敌五百人到马集，而我民兵、区干队不足二十人，在白天即向敌人猛扑，激战一小时，敌人退出，而我们追击，致被敌人看出破绽，以五挺重机枪，三挺轻机枪向我反击，幸这外围民兵赶来，敌人才退走，我民兵虽没伤人，却消耗子弹八百发。这一时期我们领导思想是守旧的老一套，不能随着敌人的变化而变化，我们斗争的方法“不打就睡觉”，放松了政治领导。经过较长期的教育和血的教训，体会了不打歼灭战，因为将来的械弹补给是个问题。今春以来是好多了，如四月间敌一四三旅四二八团“扫荡”我砖庙集，我外线出击曹定公路，在王店南边，敌三十人携机枪一挺与区干队民兵四十人展开激战，相持于公路两侧的沟里。要是在去年，就一鼓劲冲过去了；可是这次在侯保太等同志指挥下，分共一部机动的绕到敌人侧面，与正面同时猛冲，敌人溃窜，计俘获敌连长、小队长各一人，敌兵死二、伤三，我获匣枪一支，蒋币九万元，我无伤亡，在归途上还破坏电线二里半。
    我们民兵不脱离生产，只是配合区干队机动集中，打击敌人，平时他们与群众在一起，建立起群众情报等，伸入到边沿区，经常由群众监视敌人，敌人一出动马上传遍全区。
    我们的党政军民在各小区工作，都武装起来了，一面工作，一面打仗。为了坚持阵地，不离区不离村的斗争，区干队民兵和各部门都有自己的战斗密洞，密洞与村洞相结合，敌人来了，能打就打，不能打就躲在洞里，等敌人过后立即出来追击敌人，或镇压坏分子。总之，敌人走过，不能打乱我们工作。×庄范连珠同志，领导着民兵在敌军未走完时，即出来合击了敌人后卫部队，打死一人，活捉二人，获枪两支。等敌大队返转时，他们早已钻进密洞。×区开始挖地洞时，干部思想也不通，“地质不行”，“群众不愿挖”。领导上强调“挖地道是坚持阵地斗争的唯一依托，挖地道是保村保命”。对群众则以行政命令结合政治动员。普遍号召重点突破，领导上亲自下手，带头创造经验，及时广播。躲过一次敌人过去，大家信心更高，后又合理分工，明定赏罚，挑起竞赛。群众干部的思想都通了，挖了密洞挖支线，挖干线。支线本村挖，干线有外援，支线、干线互助连结，扩展到边沿区。敌对我们的地道非常厌恶，想尽一切方法破坏，过去发现的是破坏我们的干线，堵死洞口，或是烧烟熏洞口，但烟并不能往里进。但是在斗争中，我们又把战斗设备提高了一步。因为敌人能破坏，主要是因为地面有痕迹，现在这一点已被群众克服，而且创造了“洞下洞”、“迷人洞”、“环洞”，装置了“五眼三口”及“明井暗井”等战斗设备，不是单纯防御，而是积极的结合小武装打击敌人，用冷枪战迷惑敌人，迫使敌人不敢大胆乱找洞。以后我们还准备挖地雷，将使敌人踏上新土，就骨肉纷飞。
    在开始提出进行土地改革时，坚持游击战争，结合干部思想首先是觉得环境特殊，借口村组织都改了，没经验，实际是个人思想上怕发动分田。我们根据各区的不同情况，采取了不同的办法。
    敌人从今年三月起就一直“扫荡”。区里召开了一次村干和赤贫农会，只强调法令，不执行不行；可是回村后，好村庄酝酿，中间村只提一句分出，落后村就根本没人哼声。后来干部深入村，了解群众是怕“小老蒋”，便把工作步骤改成由小到大，由二三人发现积极分子，慢慢发展；后又转到以斗争为主，群众才广泛的起来查浮财分田，男女一齐上。现在这区已进行在土地改革的约有四分之三的村庄。
