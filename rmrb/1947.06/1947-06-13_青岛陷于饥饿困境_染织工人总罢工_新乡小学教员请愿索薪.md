Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 11th—Qingdao citizens are trapped in famine. After teachers and public servants went on strike and staged demonstrations, they received a response regarding adjusted compensation, but before the news of the adjustment had been around for a week, market prices soared again, and the teachers and public servants did not get a chance to catch their breath. On May 19th, the Elementary School Teachers' Union once again issued an open letter to all sectors of society, demanding an increase in the base salary standard. (Note: The base salary for elementary school teachers in Qingdao is as low as 60 yuan, while the black market price of rice is as high as 2,850 yuan per catty.) As for the wages of general skilled workers, they do not exceed 200,000 yuan in Chiang Kai-shek currency per month; while the price of a bolt of white cloth has risen to 320,000 yuan. Workers are forced to struggle due to the cost of living. Workers in more than 20 dyeing and weaving factories in the city are staging a general strike, demanding that the factories distribute supplies in kind. Yizhong Tobacco Company suspended work, violating the contract by not paying wages, resulting in a labor strike for wages. Workers at Zhonglu Tobacco Company are demanding adjustments to their compensation. Some workers, forced by hunger, even went to the accounting office to抢饭吃 (grab food). The general poor citizens are even more desperate, and have organized begging and fundraising teams to go to various商号 (shops and firms) to beg for donations. Cases of selling children are constantly appearing on the streets.

This newspaper reports: According to a teacher who recently fled from Xinxiang to our area, dozens of elementary school principals and teachers including Li Xiushan and Song Guangyu from twenty "bao" in Xinxiang Station Xinle Township, due to the county government's arrears in salary and inability to maintain a living, gathered at the Da Suo Public Office in mid-April to petition, painfully stating to the township head Hao Xiangyi that their salary and living allowance totaled only 54,600 yuan per month, while the price of rice had risen to 16,000 yuan per shi斗, their total monthly income was less than three dou and five sheng of millet, and the county government repeatedly delayed payment. The salaries from June and July of last year were only issued in February of this year after repeated requests. The salaries from August of last year to the present have not been seen at all. They stated that if they are not paid this time, they will not return to school to teach. They waited at the township office for four days. The township head had no choice but to order the "cultural section chief" to lead them to the county government to make a direct request. The county magistrate Huang Ruzhang replied to them, "If the township office does not pay the money owed to the county government, the county government can only not pay your salaries." The principals and teachers were extremely indignant at this response. Huang Ruzhang, fearing that the situation would escalate, finally decided to have the county bank allocate some funds to first pay the salaries for August of last year, and ordered the township office to find a way to pay the salaries for the other months.

　　青岛陷于饥饿困境
    染织工人总罢工
    新乡小学教员请愿索薪
    【新华社山东十一日电】青岛市民陷于饥饿困境。公教人员于罢教罢课与游行示威后，虽然得到调整待遇的答复，但调整消息传来未及一周，市场上涨风又起，公教人员并未得一点喘息的机会。五月十九日，小学教职员联合会再度发表告各界书，要求提高底薪标准。（按：青岛小学教职员的底薪低至六十元，黑市米价高达每斤二千八百五十元。）至于一般熟练工人工资，每月亦不超过蒋币二十万元；而一匹白布的价格已涨达三十二万元。工人迫于生活纷起斗争，全市二十余家染织业工厂工人实行总罢工，要求厂方配售实物。颐中烟草公司停工，违约不发工资，发生索资工潮。中鲁烟草公司工人要求调整待遇。若干工人更因迫于饥饿而到账房抢饭吃。一般贫苦市民，更走头无路，纷纷组织讨饭募捐队，分组赴各商号乞讨募捐，卖儿鬻女之事不断出现街头。
    【本报讯】据最近由新乡逃来我区之某教员称：新乡车站新乐乡二十个“保”的小学校长教员李秀山、宋光玉等数十人，因县府积欠薪津，无法维持生活，于四月中旬，齐集大所公所请愿，向乡长郝祥义悲痛陈述，他们的待遇：每月薪水及生活补助费总共不过五万四千六百元，而米价每市斗已涨至一万六千元，全月所得不及小米三斗五升，县府还一再拖欠，不肯发给。去年六七月份的薪津，经一再请求，到今年二月始行发下。从去年八月到现在的薪津则根本一文未见。他们表示，此次如再不发给，则决不返校上课。他们在乡公所一直等候四天，乡长没有办法，乃令“文化股长”率领他们到县政府直接要求。县长黄汝璋答复他们说：“乡公所欠县政府的款不交，县政府也只有欠你们的薪津不给。”各校长教员对此答复异常愤慨，黄汝璋深恐事态扩大，最后决定让县银行拨款一部先将去年八月份之薪津补发，其他各月仍令乡公所设法。
