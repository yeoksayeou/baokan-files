[Report from the North Henan Front of this newspaper] Our "40" Unit has been vigorously carrying out guerrilla activities along the Xinji section of the Pinghan Railway in recent days to protect the wheat harvest in the new district and combat the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops' attempts to seize wheat. All officers and soldiers have been involved in the upsurge of helping the masses with the wheat harvest. On the evening of the 22nd, the "Bojiacuan" unit, together with a detachment of engineers and local people, thoroughly destroyed six miles of railway between Tianzhuang and Shiluo in the Xinji section of the Pinghan Railway, and cut back 400 kilograms of electrical wire. On the same evening, three squads from "Qinjiacuan" harassed enemy strongholds along the Bigan Temple line and captured an enemy soldier. On the 23rd, the enemy from Jixian County invaded Manliu and Kangzhuang, attempting to seize wheat, but after our resistance, they fled back to their original nest in a sorry state. On the morning of the same day, the reconnaissance platoon of "Bojiacuan", in coordination with the militia and work teams, operated in the Daxiaohuangtun area to cover the masses' wheat harvest. They encountered more than 50 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers escorting the landlords' teams to seize wheat in Tiancunpu. They immediately defeated the enemy and seized back more than ten wheat carts from the landlords' teams. At this time, two companies of puppet troops from Huixian County came to reinforce them upon hearing the news, and a platoon of militia from Shentun also rushed to support our army upon hearing the gunfire. After four hours of repeated charges, the enemy was finally repelled, with six enemy soldiers killed or wounded, while we suffered no casualties. The "40" Unit's protection of the wheat harvest is a close combination of "fighting, harvesting wheat, and propaganda." The political department issued "Key Points for Wheat Harvest Propaganda," focusing on publicizing Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of harming the people and selling out the country by seizing grain, conscripting soldiers, and conscripting laborers. Under the scorching sun, the fields are full of people's soldiers sweating, busily cutting and transporting wheat. The resonant songs of "the army and the people are one family" echoed through the fields with the wind. Those who did not have sickles used their hands to pull up the wheat. The Deputy Political Commissar of "Qinjiacuan" took the lead in pulling up wheat. After the third machine gun company of "Bojiacuan" harvested three acres of wheat for an old widow, she said: "When my old man was alive, he said that when the Eighth Route Army comes, we will have a way out! We have really been looking forward to it!" On the afternoon of the 24th, the artillery company harvested 20.5 acres for the villagers. The landlord of the third squad brought oil cakes and egg soup, but the comrades did not eat a bite and returned them. The villager said: "If you don't eat, I will feel really bad!" The wheat harvest campaign is now in full swing. (Fu Xiaohua)

　　我军活动新汲外围
    保卫新区麦收
    【本报豫北前线讯】我“四零”部连日来，在平汉路新汲段沿线大力开展游击活动，保卫新区麦收，打击蒋伪抢麦企图，全体指战员均已卷入帮助群众麦收热潮。二十二日晚，“卜家川”配属工兵一部及地方群众，将新汲段平汉路之田庄至石骆驼间六华里铁路彻底破坏，割回电线四百斤。同日晚，“秦家川”三小队袭扰比干庙沿线敌据点时，捕获敌士兵一名。二十三日汲县敌出犯漫流、康庄，企图抢麦，经我阻击后，狼狈窜回原巢。同日上午，“卜家川”侦察排协同民兵、武工队，在大小黄屯一带活动，掩护群众麦收，适与掩护老财队抢麦的蒋军五十余名、在天村铺遭遇，当即将敌击溃，并夺回老财队麦车十余辆。此时，辉县伪军两个连闻讯出援，申屯民兵一排闻枪声亦驰援我军，经四小时反复冲杀，终将敌击退，计毙伤敌六名，而我无一伤亡。“四零”部保卫麦收，是把“打仗、麦收、宣传”密切结合起来的。政治部印发了“麦收宣传要点”，着重宣传蒋贼抢粮、抓丁、抓夫等害民卖国罪行。在火热的阳光下，麦田里到处都有人民战士流着汗，紧张的割麦、运麦，“军民一家”的嘹亮歌声，随风在田野荡漾。没有镰刀的，就用手拔，“秦家川”副政委就带头拔麦。“卜家川”机三连给一个寡妇老太太拔了三亩麦后，她说：“我老汉在世时，就说八路军来了，咱就有办法啦！当真盼来了！”二十四日下午，炮兵连给老乡割了二十亩半，三班房东给端来油饼、鸡蛋汤，同志们一口也没吃，退还了。老乡说：“你们不吃，我心里实在过意不去！”现在麦收运动正在热烈的进行中。（傅晓铧）
