Old Performers and Music
    —The Music Learning of Old Performers in the Northern Henan Democratic Theater Troupe
    Dong Jiang

    Some people still don't understand the transformation of old performers in the past few years, and are unwilling to approach them and learn from each other. Therefore, some intellectuals are unwilling to join a theater troupe with many old performers. Regarding the Northern Henan Democratic Theater Troupe, some comrades said: "I don't want to work in the Democratic Theater Troupe, it's too unsophisticated, full of opera singers. I would go if it were the ×× Theater Troupe." I think this comrade doesn't understand the old performers. Look, they are not like they used to be. They have made progress, and they are progressing very quickly. As a music worker, let me talk about the music learning of old performers when I was in the Democratic Theater Troupe.

    When I first arrived last year, they were reluctant to learn to sing, fearing it would damage their throats. Indeed, the pronunciation of old opera and singing is different, somewhat similar to Luoziju [a type of opera] , especially very different from Huaidiao (Henan Bangzi) [another type of opera]. They said: "Opera uses a *erben* [second-rate] vocal style (note 1), while singing uses a *daben* [first-rate] vocal style. Once you sing, you can't sing opera." Later, when the intellectuals sang a few folk songs, they also learned them, and singing for a period of time didn't damage their voices. So every morning was fixed as music learning time, and they learned some folk tunes. When they went home for vacation, they taught the children's corps, becoming teachers themselves. They could also do propaganda, and singing during marches made them happy, so everyone's interest was increased. When I taught them, I always kept the beat. Shuangxi, who played the painted face [a type of role in Chinese opera], couldn't keep the beat when he taught others, and felt very uncomfortable. After returning to the troupe, he immediately learned to conduct, and he could conduct when the whole troupe sang. When performing "The White-Haired Girl," he played the chairman of the farmers' association. Because he had no songs to sing, he was very unhappy. He said: "It's an opera, and I don't have a song. What a miscast!" (note 2). After performing several times, he always sang "indulging in extravagance and dissipation..." when he walked on the road or sat down to rest. One day, when there was no performance and it was a rest day, he sang again, and everyone stopped resting and surrounded him to listen. He sang thirty or forty songs from "The White-Haired Girl." Everyone dispersed to sleep only when the life squad leader intervened. This singing was equivalent to a grand concert. Later, I asked him when he learned it. The comrade who played the White-Haired Girl said: "Every time there was a performance, he was up there making the snow effect, freezing him. Sometimes I even heard him singing up there! After I made a suggestion, he only listened and didn't sing." His ears were very good. He sang these thirty or forty songs very correctly. If there were mistakes, it was because the actors sang it wrong, so he heard it wrong too. When rehearsing "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" (@@ tune Yangko opera), he was in a bad mood for a few days after the roles were assigned. At the life review meeting, he said: "There were no songs for me in 'The White-Haired Girl,' and 'Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang' asked me to play a White Army soldier. I learned the two lines of songs as soon as I heard them. I just want to sing; when I perform old opera during the day, I am unhappy to sing old opera. I want to sing more songs when performing new opera at night, but I am not assigned to do so. That's why I'm unhappy." Another old performer, named Xiao Bao, practiced new songs alone in the yard every day, walking back and forth. He said: "Times were bad in the past, but now my family has land, I am happy, shouldn't I sing a few new songs to my heart's content?!" There are several reasons why they can learn music like this: (1) In terms of economy, their families have received the fruits of struggle, and the problem of livelihood has been solved. There are no worries in their hearts, so they can wholeheartedly serve the masses. (2) Because they have been singing opera for nearly ten years, their ears have been trained very accurately and it is easy to learn. (3) They realize that the demands of the masses are increasing day by day. If they only know how to sing Luoziju, they will be abandoned by the masses one day. Learning to perform Yangko opera can be popular with the masses. (4) Several model performers have taken the lead, realizing that they are not weaker than intellectuals in ability, and have the confidence to learn.

    There is also an old performer comrade who plays the transverse flute, named Er Pang. At first, I asked him if the transverse flute was a good instrument. He said: "What can you do with playing the transverse flute? People are learning to perform new operas, and I can't learn anything!" So I mobilized him to learn to read music. He said: "Does it do anything?" I explained to him the status of old performers in the new society, as long as they have skills, old and new performers are the same." His thinking became clear: he was no longer a "sound man" (note 3) who was looked down upon, but a master of the new society, with a future, so he learned "1234567". In a few days, he learned these seven solfeggio names. I also told him which hole on the transverse flute makes "1" and which hole makes "2"... and asked him to learn to play "Gangdiao" [a type of tune] first. It was very difficult to look at the old score and play it first, because he had learned the old opera score by listening. This time he also asked me to play it for him with the Huqin. Sure enough, I played it once or twice, and he could immediately follow along. When I stopped playing, he couldn't play it anymore. So I played it while he played it, practicing several times. After he remembered it, he turned back to the score and played it. Using this method to learn, in less than a month, when rehearsing the first Yangko opera "Get Mobilized," he served as the main character in the musical performance (the flute's pitch is high and bright). His technique of playing old opera is very high. The masses reflected that: "The transverse flute is really good, like a bird chirping!" Some people said: "I only listen to the transverse flute and don't listen to the singing." Generally speaking, when instrumental and vocal music are played at the same time, instrumental music will not attract attention, and the audience will pay attention to vocal music. However, our old performer comrade broke this rule. When "The White-Haired Girl" was about to be rehearsed, he happily said: "This time, it is a good opportunity for me to learn." I said: "Good! Work hard, and if you learn all ninety-two songs, then ordinary songs will not be a problem to sing and play!" In the first few days, I first asked him to learn the songs of Mu Renzhi, Huang Shiren, and Huang's mother (note 4). These songs are more difficult. Whenever he had time, he would ask me to lead the singing. When marching, as long as it was not a very difficult mountain road, we would walk side by side. If the singing stopped, another comrade would run up and say: "Teach me to sing mine!" Although my mouth was dry and the voice gradually became small, my mood was raised to the highest point, and I didn't feel tired at all. When the band rehearsed, as soon as the actors heard that it was their song, they would quickly run there and follow along, and after singing, they would say: "Play it again for him!" Sometimes even making the comrades in the band unhappy, but everyone was learning.

    After such a wave of music learning, when rehearsing "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" (@@ tune Yangko tune), the actors asked to copy the lyrics with the music score, saying: "Er Pang has learned to read music, we can't always ask others to teach us, I also want to learn to read music! We have learned '1234567', isn't it easy to learn again?!" They held their own lyrics, tapping the beat in their hands, and after singing for a few days, some people asked me: "Is it right that the two words underlined once are one beat, and the two words underlined twice are shorter?!" I replied in time "Yes!" (note 5) Two old performer comrades who played the Huqin could listen to and follow the performance of the music score in the small Yangko opera "Get Mobilized." "The White-Haired Girl" is a large opera with many songs, so I asked them: "Are you still listening to the performance?! Er Pang can learn ten, you may only learn one by listening." I cleared up their thinking in the face of difficulties, and they also worked harder to learn.

    Now the people in the entire troupe are divided into groups, and everyone voluntarily learns one kind of musical instrument, saying: "During the patriotic self-defense war, one person must be able to do the work of several people. If you don't learn musical instruments, when the war situation comes, when you are divided into groups to work, you won't be able to do anything!" Several old performers in the band can read simple new songs and don't need others to teach them anymore. Seeing me recording old opera scores, and still having to ask him to play what I recorded, he simply started blowing and recording himself, and asked me to look at it. There were not many mistakes, just no bar lines. The progress of the old performer comrades implicitly enlightened and warned the intellectual comrades. One comrade said: "Er Pang has made progress really quickly! The old performers have learned to read music, and their ears are good. If we fall behind, it would be really embarrassing! In fact, the intellectuals are behind now. During the vacation, I will not go home, but will study music hard here."

    I believe that the old performer comrades can take another step forward and make many contributions to the research of old music. They are familiar with old music, have good skills, and have accurate ears, which are all the best favorable conditions. If we, the builders of new music, leave them, then the future is unimaginable.

    When performing "The White-Haired Girl," a small band was organized, and the instruments were very simple: three Erhus, three Banhu (note 6), one Di Hu (note 7), one transverse flute, one Sanxian, one Jinghu, and the percussion instruments were the complete set used in old opera, plus a large gong, a large @, and a small bell; most of the performers were old performers, and they were also the main characters. The use of percussion instruments was entirely by old performers. Just tell them where to use what kind of emotion, and they will immediately play it out, and then make slight modifications, which created various familiar emotions such as very fiery, very excited, very cunning, and very tragic for "The White-Haired Girl" and other operas. Some old things and techniques were also added to the performance of the music, such as *baoqiang* [melodic embellishment] and *gunbai* [rolled recitation], which created a very intense scene, and the peasants felt that it had tunes and styles. Leaving the old performers, even if you add gongs and violins, I am afraid you will not be able to achieve such a good effect that is consistent with the emotions of the masses and welcomed by them!?

    I was learning techniques from them and recording old tunes when I left them—the people's music workers—for other more important work. I heard that they performed "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" in Linqi. I wish them hard work, success, and more service to the masses!

    Art work comrades, do not look down on old performers!
    Their feelings are inseparable from the peasants!
    They have performance skills that the masses love and are familiar with!
    They can make progress, and quickly!
    I hope new art workers will cooperate with them!
    Learn from each other and help each other!
    Together, we can build new national music that is understood by the people, which is good music.

    (Note)
    (1) *Erben* vocal style is a high and thin sound.
    (2) *Cuozhong* is a Linxian dialect, meaning bad.
    (3) *Xiangzi* is a band organized by old performers in the old society, playing music when rich people get married and hold funerals.
    (4) Characters in the opera "The White-Haired Girl."
    (5) "Underline once" is an eighth note. In special cases, that is, in 2/4, 4/4, 3/4... and other beats, it can be said that "two words are one beat", but in other cases, such as 2/6 beat songs, it is different.
    (6) Banhu: It is a kind of Huqin used in the Luoziju tune of Linxian. There are many styles, and some Hu tubes are small gourd-shaped. This high-pitched instrument has a better tone than Jinghu. The people in the Taihang area are familiar with it. When performing Yangko opera, it can be used and the effect is very good.
    (7) Di Hu: It is a Hu tube that is a bit thicker, and the style is the same as Erhu. It is a low-pitched instrument. In general theater troupes with low conditions, the combination of flute, Banhu, Erhu, Di Hu, and Sanxian five instruments can achieve very good results.

　　旧艺人与音乐
    ——豫北民主剧团旧艺人的音乐学习
    东江
    有些人对于几年来旧艺人的改造还不了解，不愿意接近他们，互相学习，所以一个旧艺人多的剧团，有些知识分子就不愿意进去了。关于豫北民主剧团，就有些同志说：“我不去民主剧团工作，土里土气的，尽是些唱戏的，要是××剧团我就去。”我觉得这位同志是不了解旧艺人的，你看，他们已不像过去那样，他们进步了，而且进步得很快，我是一个音乐工作者，就让我谈谈在民主剧团时，旧艺人音乐的学习吧。
    去年我初到的时候，他们都不愿意学唱歌，恐怕唱坏了喉咙。的确，旧剧与唱歌的发音是不一样，和落子还近似一点，尤其和淮调（河南梆子）大不一样，他们就说：“唱戏用的是二本腔，（注一）唱歌用的是大本腔，一唱歌就不能唱戏了。”以后知识分子唱会几个民歌、他们也跟着学会了，唱了一个时期也没有坏了嗓子。于是每天早晨固定为音乐学习时间，学了些小调。放假回家了，就教给儿童团，自己当了老师，又能宣传，行军时唱唱也高兴，大家的兴趣就提高了。我教他们的时候总是打着拍子，唱花脸的双喜回在他家，教别人时不会打，感觉很不得劲，回到剧团以后马上学会了指挥，全团唱歌时他也能指挥了。排演《白毛女》他演农会主席，因为没有歌子唱，他很不高兴，他说：“演歌剧哩，我也没有一个歌，真是错种！”（注二）出演几次以后，他在路上走的时候，坐下休息的时候，总是唱着“花天那个酒地……”。一天不出演了，休息日，他又唱起来，大家都不休息了，围着他听，他把《白毛女》的歌曲唱了三、四十曲，生活队长干涉的时候，大家才散去睡觉了。这次的唱歌等于开了一次盛大的音乐会。后来我问他什么时候学会的，演白毛女的同志说：“每次出演，都是他在上面下雪作效果，冻得他受不了，有时我还听见他在上边唱呢！以后提了意见，他才光听不唱了。”他的耳朵很好，这三、四十个歌曲唱的都很正确，假使错了的话，那是演员就给他唱错了，所以他也听错了。排演“王贵与李香香”（＠＠调秧歌剧）的时候，分配角色以后，他几天情绪不好，在生活检讨会上他说：“白毛女上没有我的唱曲，‘王贵与李香香’又叫我当一个白军，唱了两句歌，一学就会，我光想唱歌；在白天演旧剧的时候，我就不高兴唱旧戏，想在夜间演新剧时多唱几个歌子，可是就不分配给咱，就这我不高兴。”还有一个旧艺人，名叫小保的，每天一个人在院里，走来走去的习新歌，他说：“从前时光不好，如今我家有了地，我就高兴了，还不唱几个新歌痛快痛快！？”他们都能这样的学习音乐有几种原因：（１）在经济方面，他们家里分得了斗争果实，生活问题解决了，心里没有什么顾虑，就一心为群众服务。（２）因为近十年唱戏，自己的耳朵练习得很准确，容易学习。（３）认识到群众的要求，一天一天的高起来，光会唱落子，总有一天会被群众抛弃的，学会演秧歌剧才能受群众欢迎。（４）有几个模范者起了带头作用，认识到自己并不比知识分子能力弱，有了学习的信心。
    还有一个吹横笛的旧艺人同志，名叫二胖。最初我问他说，横笛是一件好乐器，他说：“吹横笛的还能办个啥事，人家都学演新剧哩，我啥也学不成！”于是我动员他识谱，他说：“不办事吧！？”我又向他说明旧艺人在新社会中的地位，只要有技术，新旧艺人都是一样。”他思想明确了：他不再是被人下看的“响子”。（注三）而是新社会的主人，有前途，就学起“１２３４５６７”来，不几天，就把这七个唱名学会了。我又告诉他在横笛上那个眼作“１”，那个眼作“２”，……就叫他学着先吹“刚调”。先上来看旧谱吹很困难，因为他学旧戏谱的时候都是听会的，这次他也叫我给他用胡琴拉一下，果然我拉了一两遍，他马上就能跟着吹，我不拉了，他也吹不成了。就这样我一边拉，他一边吹，练习了几次，他记住以后，再回头来对着谱子吹。用这样的方法来学习，不到一个月，排演第一个秧歌剧“动员起来”的时候，他就担任了乐曲演奏的主角（笛子音高而亮）。他吹旧戏的技术很高，群众反映就说：“横笛真啸的好，活像小鸟叫一样！”还有的说：“我就光听横笛哩”没有听唱。”一般说，器乐和声乐同时演奏，器乐不会引人注意，听众都要注意声乐的，然而我们的旧艺人同志却打破了这个规则。要排演《白毛女》了，他高兴的说：“这一回，可是我学习的好机会了。”我说：“好！加油学吧，九十二个歌曲都学会了，那么普通的歌曲都不成问题会唱，会演奏啦！”头几天我先叫他学穆仁智，黄世仁，黄母（注四）的歌曲，这些歌曲比较难一些，只要有空他就找我给他领唱。行军时只要不是很难走的山路，俺俩都是走在并齐。假若歌声一停的话，另一个同志就会跑上来说：“教我唱唱我的！”虽然我的嘴里干得声音渐渐的细小了，我的情绪被他提到最高处，一点不觉得疲倦。在乐队练习的时候，演员一听轮到他的歌曲了，很快就跑到那里，跟着唱起来，唱完还说：“再给他奏一遍！”有时甚而使乐队的同志不高兴，但是大家都是为了学习。
    经过这样的一个音乐学习浪潮以后，接着排演“王贵与李香香”（＠＠调秧歌调）的时候，演员就要求抄剧词要带歌谱，都说：“人家二胖就学会念谱了，咱也不能一直叫别人教，我也要学读谱哩！“１２３４５６７”都学会了，再学还不就容易了？！”他们拿着各人的剧词，手中打着拍子，唱几天之后，就有些人问我：“这底下划一道的两个字是一拍，划两道的短些，对不对？！”我就及时答复“对”！（注五）有两个拉胡琴的旧艺人同志，在“动员起来”小秧歌剧中的乐谱，他能听着跟着别人演奏。《白毛女》大歌剧歌子多，我就问他们：“还听着演奏吗？！人家二胖学十个你可能听会一个。”在困难中给他打通了思想，也就加油学习了。
    现在全剧团的人都分成小组，各人自愿学乐器一种，都说：“在爱国自卫战争的时候，一个人要顶几个人用才可以，要不学乐器，到了战争情况，分开小组工作的时候，就不办事啦！”乐队中的同志，有好几个旧艺人都能读简单的生歌子，不用别人再教了。他们看见我记录旧剧乐谱，还得找他吹我记，索性他就自吹自记起来，记了一个叫我看看，错的还不多，就是没有小节线。旧艺人同志这样的进步，无形中给知识分子同志一个启示，也是一个警告，一个同志就说：“二胖真进步快哩！旧艺人都学会读谱了，人家的耳朵又好，咱要是落了后，可真丢人极啦！实际现在知识分子就落在后面了，放假了，我不回家，要在这里好好学习音乐。”
    我相信旧艺人同志能再提高一步，对于旧音乐的研究，能够有不少的供献。他们熟悉旧音乐，技术好，耳朵听音准确，这都是最好的有利条件。我们新音乐的建造者，假使离开了他们，那么将来的前途是不可想像的了。
    出演《白毛女》的时候，组织了一个小小的乐队，乐器简陋得很：三把二胡三把板胡，（注六），一把低胡，（注七）一个横笛，一个三弦，一个京胡，打击乐器就是旧剧用的全套，加上个大锣，一个大＠，一个小铃；演奏人多数是旧艺人，而且还是主角，使用打击乐器的完全是旧艺人，只要告诉他们：在什么地方用什么样的感情，他们会马上打出来，再经略微的修改就行了，就这样曾给《白毛女》及其他歌剧创造了很红火、很兴奋、很狡猾、很凄惨的各种人民熟悉的感情。在乐曲的演奏中也加了些旧的东西和技术，如包腔，滚白等，这样造成一个很激烈的场面，农民才觉得是有腔有调的，离开了旧艺人，就是再加上铜锣、提琴，恐怕也不能获得这样和群众感情一致而受他们欢迎的良好效果吧！？
    我正向他们学习技术，记录旧乐曲的时候，为了其他更重要的工作而离开了他们——人民的音乐工作者。听说他们在临淇上演了“王贵与李香香”，我祝他们努力，成功，为群众更多的服务吧！
    艺术工作同志们，不要看轻旧艺人！
    他们的感情和农民分不开！
    他们有群众喜爱而熟悉的演奏技巧！
    他们能进步，而且很快！
    希望新艺术工作者和他们合作！
    互相学习，互相帮助！
    共同来建造为人民所了解的民族新音乐，这才是好的音乐。
    （注）
    （一）二本腔是高而细的声音。
    （二）错种是林县土语，不好的意思。
    （三）响子是在旧社会旧艺人组织的乐队，在富人结婚行丧的时候奏乐。
    （四）《白毛女》的剧中人物。
    （五）“下面划一道”的是八分音符，在特殊的情况下即是在２／４，４／４，３／４……等的拍子中，可以说是“两个字一拍子”，然而到其他情况下如２／６拍子的歌子中就不一样。
    （六）板胡：就是林县的落子腔用的一种胡琴，样式有多种，有的胡筒是一个小瓢形。这种高音乐器比京胡的声色好，太行区的人民熟悉，演秧歌剧的时候，可以用它，效果很好。
    （七）低胡：就是胡筒比较粗一点的，和二胡的样式一样，是一种低音乐器，在一般条件低的剧团就用笛子、板胡、二胡、低胡、三弦五种乐器配合演奏，效果就很好了。
