　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: The "Pravda" newspaper in Moscow recently published an article by Marinin entitled "Disarmament or Arms Race?" The author focused on the fact that the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on December 14, 1946, urging the early implementation of universal adjustment and reduction of armaments and forces, but it has not yet produced practical results. He pointed out that some people have been showing a tendency to distort the true meaning of the UN General Assembly resolution, weaken it, and exclude its most important requirements. In 1947, Britain will spend on its armed forces an amount virtually equal to the total loan granted by the United States. In the context of a severe manpower shortage, Britain is now maintaining one million more troops than in 1945. The United States' annual military budget for 1947-48 is one-third of the total budget and exceeds pre-war defense spending by eleven times. Marinin continued: Objective observers unanimously believe that the United States has continued to launch an unprecedented propaganda campaign for armaments and expansion policies as its response to the UN General Assembly's resolution on adjustment and disarmament. The article concludes: All these facts are obvious proof of the true nature of the tendency shown by the British and American representatives in the field of disarmament, which is not to implement a policy of disarmament, but to implement a policy of arms race. Therefore, there is a conspiracy to abolish the UN General Assembly resolution, which creates a very significant contradiction between solemn declarations and actual behavior. However, an arms race replacing construction will undoubtedly destroy international trust, and instead of unity, it will weaken international security. And the countries of the world are strongly eager to fully implement the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly of December 14, 1946.

　　美英实行扩军竞赛抛弃联大缩军决议
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表马里宁所著一文，题为：“裁减军备，还是扩军竞赛？”作者注重着这样的事实，即联合国大会在一九四六年十二月十四日通过敦促及早进行普遍的调整及裁减军备及武力之决议，至今未能产生实际的结果。他指出：某些人一直就表现他们有曲解联大决议的真正意义，减弱联大决议及排除其最重要要求之倾向。英国在一九四七年将因其武装部队而耗费实际上与美国给予的全部贷款一样大的款项，在缺乏人力非常严重的情况下，英国现在正维持比一九四五年还多出一百万的军队。美国一九四七年至四八年度的一年军事预算，为总预算的三分之一，且超过战前国防费用十一倍。马里宁继称：客观的观察家们均一致认为：美国已继续展开对军备与扩张政策之史无先例的宣传，作为其对联大调整及裁减军备决议的答复。该文结语称：这一切事实都是显而易见的证明了英美两国代表在裁减军备方面所表现的倾向之真正性质，是不实行裁减军备之政策，而正实行扩军竞赛政策。因此，就有废除联大决议的诡计，就造成了庄严宣言与实际行为之间极显著的矛盾。然而，扩军竞赛代替建设就无破坏国际的信任，代替团结，就会减弱国际的安全。而世界各国，则强烈的热望着将联合国大会一九四六年十二月十四日的决议完全予以实现。
