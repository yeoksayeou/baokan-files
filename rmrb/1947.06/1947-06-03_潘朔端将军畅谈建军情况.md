　　General Pan Shuoduan, commander of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army, was interviewed by a reporter on the anniversary of the Haicheng Uprising (May 30th). When asked about the army's military construction situation after the uprising, General Pan said: "Our army has conducted democratic discussions throughout the entire army and passed a military construction plan, first carrying out rectification and training, and then participating in actual combat. The rectification and training has now lasted for four months, and the general political awareness of commanders and fighters has been raised. Currently, apart from dispatching a portion to participate in front-line battles, the majority remains in the rear to continue rectification and training." Speaking of the relationship between the military and the people, and between officers and soldiers, General Pan said modestly, "Compared with the old troops of the Democratic Allied Army, we are still doing very poorly, but compared with before the uprising, it is completely different." Soldiers are automatically saving food to help the poor, helping the masses with farming, and so on. In terms of officer-soldier relations, due to the implementation of democratic management, a style of officers loving soldiers, soldiers loving officers, and being hardworking and simple has gradually developed. The phenomenon of corruption has now disappeared, and even many commanders and fighters don't even smoke tobacco anymore, using the money for tobacco to buy learning stationery. At the same time, to further reduce the burden on the people, we have planted more than 2,000 mu of land, and the seeds are all solved through our own frugality." Speaking of the consolidation of the troops, General Pan said: "There were desertions after the initial uprising, but since the end of last year, there has not been a single desertion." Finally, General Pan expressed his views on the current situation, saying, "Recently, good news has been frequently reported from various liberated areas, with over ninety brigades of Chiang's troops being annihilated. Our People's Liberation Army has taken the initiative on all battlefields, and there will be more exciting programs to come." General Pan ended his conversation with a cheerful and confident tone, saying, "Our team, determined to fight for the cause of people's liberation, still has very glorious combat missions waiting for us!"

　　潘朔端将军畅谈建军情况
    【新华社东北一日电】海城起义（五月三十日）周年，记者走访东北民主同盟军军长潘朔端将军，询以该军起义后的建军情况，潘将军谈称：“本军曾经全军民主讨论，通过了建军计划，首先进行整训，然后参加实际斗争。现在整训已达四个月，一般指战员政治认识已经提高。现除派出一部参加前线战斗之外，大部仍留后方继续整训。”谈到军民与官兵关系时，潘将军谦逊地说：“比起民主联军的老部队来，我们还做得很不够，但与起义前比较则完全是两付面目了”。战士们自动节粮救济贫民，帮助群众耕种等等。在官兵关系方面，因实行了民主管理，一般已逐渐养成官爱兵，兵爱官和刻苦朴实的作风。过去贪污腐化现象现已绝迹，甚至许多指战员连烟叶都不抽了，把烟叶钱用来买学习文具。同时更为减轻人民负担，我们种了二千多亩地，种子全由自己节约解决。”谈到部队的巩固情况时，潘将军说：“刚起义后逃亡现象是有的，但自去年底以来，就没有一个逃亡了”。最后，潘将军发表了对时局的观感称：“最近各个解放区捷报频传，蒋军被歼者达九十个旅以上，我们人民解放军在各战场都转入了主动，以后精彩的节目就更要多了。”潘将军以开朗的自信的语调结束他的谈话说：“我们这支决心为人民解放事业而奋斗的队伍，还有很光荣的战斗任务在等着哩！”
