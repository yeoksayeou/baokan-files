Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. TASS, Budapest: Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi issued a statement regarding the U.S. note to General Slarredo, Deputy Chairman of the Allied Control Commission, stating in brief: The U.S. note touches on two points related to me personally, regarding me as the "leader of a Communist minority" and the "Communist Deputy Prime Minister," and says that I "clearly" and openly expressed satisfaction that my "iron fist party" could control Hungary. I must say: I have never made such a statement. This, just like the Budapest street fighting reported in the American newspapers, and the clumsy story about Nagy's resignation, is far from the truth. The American note insists that Nagy's resignation resulted in a reorganization of Hungarian political forces; to this point, I can only answer that we do not know of any reorganization of political forces, because the Smallholders Party still retains all its positions. All the changes related to Nagy's resignation are based not only on the unanimous resolutions of the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the National Peasant Party, but also on the unanimous resolutions of the Smallholders Party and the Political Committee of the National Assembly, which have all been approved by the President of the Republic. Now the Hungarian people clearly understand the current situation, and no note or attempt to save the enemies of democracy can stop them from punishing the treasonous conspirators and giving them the punishment they deserve.

　　匈牙利副总理发表声明：
    美国照会不符合事实
    任何照会阻止不了匈人严惩叛国者
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利副总理拉柯希对美国给与盟国管委会副主席斯拉芮多夫将军的照会发表声明，略称：美国照会有两点涉及到我个人，把我当作“共产党少数派的领袖”和“共产党的副总理”，并说，“明白地”公开地表示满意于我的“铁拳政党”能控制匈牙利。我要说：我绝未作过那样的声明。这恰如美国报纸所报导的布达佩斯巷战，和关于奈基辞职的拙劣故事一样，是远离真实的。美国的照会硬说，奈基辞职的结果成为匈牙利政治势力改组；对这点，我只能回答，我们不知道有任何政治势力的改组，因为小地主党现在仍保有其一切职位。有关奈基辞职发生的一切变化不但是基于共产党、社会民主党和全国农民党的一致决议，而且也是基于小地主党和国民议会的政治委员会之一致决议，这些决议又都经本共和国的总统所批准。如今匈牙利人民已清楚地了解目前的形势，没有一个想拯救民主之敌人的照会或企图能阻止他们对叛国阴谋者给予惩罚和罪有应得的处治。
