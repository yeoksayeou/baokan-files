　　Eliminate All Traces of Feudalism, Leave No Family in Poverty
    More Than a Hundred Villages in Xinjiang Begin Re-Examination
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 20th] In Xinjiang, over a hundred villages have initially realized "the tillers own their land." A comprehensive re-examination is now underway. The land reform in the county began successively in early May. The first district is now conducting a comprehensive re-examination, and the second district is also nearing completion of the initial land distribution. In total, farmers in one hundred villages across the county have rationally received land. To further deepen this, the first district has universally proposed investigating class status to eliminate all traces of feudalism and ensure no family remains in poverty. During this period, much experience has been created: (1) Visiting and listening to grievances to raise awareness. First, policies were universally publicized, especially the policy of not struggling against middle peasants, and the resounding slogan of "total reckoning and collective emancipation" was put forward, uniting the broad masses and stabilizing people's hearts. Second, each village organized a Land Reform Committee, dividing the work of investigating and listening to grievances. Using bitterness to evoke bitterness, they mobilized those who were ready to struggle immediately, without delaying or wasting time. At the same time, support from above was needed to back the peasants. For example, those whom the masses demanded to be detained were detained to help the peasants suppress the reactionary arrogance. (2) Not only land but also other property of landlords must be handed over for compensation and they must personally deliver it to the peasants. (3) When distributing fruits, individuals reported their needs publicly, and the distribution was discussed. For example, in Zhongcun, when distributing fruits, people first reported what they needed, and then the review committee deliberated, and the distribution was completed in half an hour. When distributing land, attention was paid to taking care of the masses, cadres, and activists who suffered losses last year, providing consideration based on the severity of the losses.

　　不留一条封建尾巴不留一户赤贫
    新绛百余村开始复查
    【本报太岳二十日电】新绛已有一百个村初步实现耕者有其田。现正全部进行复查，该县土地改革自五月初旬先后开始，现一区已全面进行复查，二区也接近完成初步分田。总计全县已有一百个村庄农民合理的分得土地。为更深入一步，一区普遍提出查阶级，做到不留一条封建尾巴，不留一个赤贫户。在此一时期内，创造了不少经验：（一）访苦诉苦，提高觉悟，首先普遍的宣传了政策，特别是不斗争中农的政策，响亮的提出了总清算，齐翻身的口号，团结了广大群众，安定了人心。其次各村组织了土地改革委员会，分工调查访苦，以苦引苦，动员成熟马上就斗，不要放冷耽误时间。同时自上而下要为农民撑腰，如群众要求扣押的对象就扣押起来，帮助农民压倒反动气焰。（二）不仅地主土地，连其他财物亦必须交出抵算，并要他亲自给农民送去。（三）分配果实时自报公议，如中村在分配果实时，先报自己需要什么，再由评议委员会评议，在半个钟头内就分完了。分土地时注意照顾了去年受损失的群众、干部与积极分子，根据损失轻重去照顾。
