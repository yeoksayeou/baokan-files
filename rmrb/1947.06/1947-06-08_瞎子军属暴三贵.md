　　Blind Military Family Member Bao Sanggui
　　Wang Zhounan

　　In Shangchen, there is a blind man named Bao Sanggui. If he hadn't said it at the grievance meeting, no one would know how he went blind. It turned out that he wasn't born blind. In the famine of 1932, he took his wife and three children and fled to Hongdong County, Shanxi Province. The black-hearted landlords and wealthy people, seeing so many famine refugees, forbade them from begging in the villages. This made Bao Sanggui's family suffer terribly. He could only dig up miscellaneous wild vegetables in the fields every day, never seeing a grain of rice in his stomach. Once, after eating some unknown wild vegetable, his eyes became redder and redder day by day. Before the winter was over, he couldn't see anything. If his wife and children hadn't begged for food and led him back, he would have been fed to the dogs in Shanxi.

　　Last winter, after the liberation, the villagers said, "Old Cheng (Bao Sanggui's nickname) has poor eyesight and many children, let's give him more!" As a result, he was allocated twenty mu of good land and five tiled houses. When his family moved from the temple to the new house, he said to people, "I've been running around and scavenging all my life, this is the first time I've had a home!"

　　This spring, Chiang Kai-shek wanted to attack Yan'an, and the young people in the village who had been liberated were discussing joining the army to defend the land and Chairman Mao. One evening, Bao Sanggui called his eldest son, Rongbao, to his side and said, "Rongbao! Do you know who your real father is?!" Rongbao didn't know how to answer, and stared at his father with wide eyes. Sanggui continued, "Since you were born into this family, we've suffered all kinds of hardships from fleeing famine to begging, but your father hasn't been able to provide anything for you. Since Chairman Mao's troops came, we've had houses and land. Remember: Chairman Mao is your real father! Now, join the army to defend Chairman Mao, to defend our houses and land, Rongbao, go!" The next morning, Bao Sanggui made a good meal for Rongbao and, together with the villagers, sent Rongbao and seven or eight other young people to the district office amidst drums and gongs.

　　When the new soldiers were stationed in Wu'an, the young women in the village stayed up all night making clothes, shoes, and socks, preparing to visit their husbands who had just joined the army. That day, Bao Sanggui also went to the village office to get a travel permit to visit his son. The village chief jokingly said to him, "Old Cheng? Missing your son?!" He suddenly blushed and hurriedly explained, "No! No..." Although he was really afraid that Rongbao would miss home and fall behind in the army, he was too embarrassed to say it. Seeing that he was embarrassed, the village chief changed the subject and said, "If you want to go, I'll assign you a mule! How can you walk two hundred li back and forth if you're blind?" He pretended to take the stamped travel permit and walk out, while turning back and saying repeatedly, "No need! No need! Everyone is so busy, I haven't made any contributions, don't bother everyone." As he said this, he walked out the door. Finally, the village cadres discussed, "This old man is a bit stubborn, we should still assign him one!" The next morning, when the family assigned to provide the mule went to help him get ready, his wife told them, "He got up and left with our second youngest daughter just as it was getting light." The mule had to be used for something else.

　　After Bao Sanggui arrived at the army unit and saw his son, he didn't ask him endless questions like other family members. He just secretly instructed his second youngest daughter to pay attention to whether her brother looked happy or not. Later, the company commander, instructor, and soldiers kept telling him, "Rongbao is very lively and capable here, he has a great future!" Even Rongbao didn't stay with him for long, only came to greet him during meals, and then hopped along with the other comrades to attend classes and drills. He was then relieved. The next day, he packed up and started to head back. When Rongbao saw him off at the edge of the village, he turned around and instructed, "Rongbao! I don't ask anything of you, I only hope you can perform a meritorious service, that will be your filial piety to me."

　　In April, the village distributed land for substitute plowing. Everyone said, "Let's give Old Cheng four more mu for substitute plowing! His eyes aren't good." When he heard about it, he hurriedly found the labor director and said, "My child hasn't yet performed any meritorious service for everyone, I can't let everyone do more substitute plowing for me. Although my eyes aren't good, I can still do a little business with my second youngest daughter leading me!" Although the labor director repeatedly explained to him, he finally didn't let everyone do four more mu of substitute plowing for him.

　　Military families originally had special people responsible for fetching water, but Bao Sanggui always carried it himself. As soon as it got light, he would pick up the buckets and, led by his second youngest daughter, head to the well. When others offered to deliver water to his home, his water tank was already full. Someone asked him, "Why do you bother yourself like this?" He always said, "My child joined the army for our own benefit, and besides, he hasn't performed any meritorious service for everyone, how can we trouble people." The people of Shangchen all said, "Old Cheng is truly a model military family member!"

　　瞎子军属暴三贵
    王周南
    上陈有个瞎子暴三贵。若问他的眼是怎样瞎了的，要不是他在诉苦会上说出来谁也不知道。原来，他的眼并不是胎生就瞎。三十二年闹灾荒，他带老婆和三个孩子，逃荒到山西洪洞县。黑心眼的地主老财们，见逃荒的多了，便禁止难民到村里要饭。这一下暴三贵一家可苦透了。他每天只能到地里挖点乱七八糟的野菜吃，肚里成天见不到一个粮食籽。有一次不知道吃了点什么野菜，眼就一天一天红起来，一个冬天没过去，两眼就啥也看不见了。要不是老婆孩子讨着饭引着他回来，险些儿喂了山西狗。
    去年冬天，翻身，村里人都说：“老成哥（三贵小名）少眼没目的，孩子又多，多分给他些东西吧！”结果分配给他二十亩好地、五间瓦房。当他一家从庙里搬到新房子时，他对人说：“我一辈东跑西拾哩，这才算有了一个家！”
    今年春天蒋介石要进攻延安啦，村里翻了身的青年人们讨论着要参军，保卫土地，保卫毛主席。晚上，暴三贵把他的大儿子荣宝叫到跟前说：“荣宝！你知道谁是你的真老子？！”荣宝不知怎样答好，两个眼瞪着他爹，三贵接下去说：“自从你生到这个家，逃荒、要饭，啥罪也受过了，可是当爹的啥也没有给儿置下啥。自从毛主席的队伍来了，咱才有了房子、地。你记住：毛主席才是你的真正老子哩！现在参军保卫毛主席，保卫咱的房子、地，荣宝，你去！”第二天一早，暴三贵给荣宝做了一顿好饭吃，就和村里人一齐把荣宝和其他七八个青年，吹吹打打的送到区上了。
    新战士驻防到武安来了，村里的青年妇女们，便连夜赶做衣服鞋袜，准备去看望她们参军不久的丈夫。这天暴三贵也到村公所开路条，去看望他的儿子去。村长故意和他开玩笑说：“老成哥？想念儿子吧！？”他突然脸一红，连忙辩白说：“不！不………”虽然他心里实在是怕荣宝在队上想家落了后才去看他的，但也终于没好意思说出来。村长看着怕他难为情，便改变话头说：“要去就给你派个牲口吧！你瞎瞎摸摸的怎能来回走二百里地？”他一面装着盖了章的路条往外走，一面回头连声说：“可不！可不！大家忙呼呼的，咱有啥功劳，再麻烦大家。”说着他就走出大门了，最后村干部商量说：“这老汉脾气有点固执，还是给他派个吧！”第二天一早，派牲口户去找他起身时，他老婆才告诉说：“天刚明，俺二小女拉着他就起身走了。”这个牲口便只好再去做别的事。
    暴三贵到部队见了他的儿子后，他没有象其他家属一样问长问短。他光暗暗嘱付他的二小女，注意她哥哥脸上高兴不高兴。后来连长指导员和战士们，不断对他说：“荣宝在这里顶活跳顶能干，将来前途可大哩！”就是荣宝也不在他跟前多呆会，光在吃饭时来招呼他一声，就跟着其他同志们蹦蹦跳跳的上课出操去了。他这才放了心。第二天就收拾往回走。当荣宝把他送到村边时，他回头嘱付说：“荣宝！我啥也不结记你，只盼你能立个功，就算你孝敬了。”
    四月间村里分配代耕地、大家说，给老成哥多代耕四亩吧！他眼不吃劲。他听说了，连忙找着抗勤主任说：“咱孩子还没有给大家立下功，咱可不敢让大家给咱多代耕地。咱眼虽然不吃劲，有二小女拉着，咱还能做个小生意哩！”虽然抗勤主任再三给他解释，但他终于没有让大家给他多代耕四亩地。
    军属吃水，本来村里是有专人负责的，但暴三贵总是自己担。天一明就挑上桶，由二小女拉着往井上了。当旁人往他家里送水时，他的缸早已满满的了。有人问他“你为什么这样自己想受忙？”他总是说：“孩子参军是为咱自己事，再说他又没有给大家立下功，咱怎能麻烦人。”上陈老百姓都说：“老成哥可真是个军属模范！”
