　　Cixian County Determines Production Policy Within the City
    Developing Small Factories and Workshops
    [Our Newspaper, Cixian News] After years of struggle, the problem of feudal exploitation has been largely resolved in Cixian County. Now, the county is organizing and carrying out production. After the mass movement, the masses were not clear about the direction of production. Some of the masses also had many concerns ideologically and were afraid to produce and become wealthy. The leadership studied the specific ideas of the masses, guiding everyone to discuss why they should struggle and how they could completely turn themselves over. This broke down ideological concerns and clarified the understanding that the struggle was to remove the bonds, and to have a good time, one must produce well. The slogan "Untie the bonds, overturn the big stone slab, and let's all organize and make a big push for production" was immediately put forward. Then, a discussion was held on what the main focus of urban production should be. Yang Dezhang said, "In the past, we were doing business, and buying and selling goods was unreliable. Sometimes the money flowed out and we were exploited by others. In the future, we must produce local goods." Xu Shoubao said, "Our cooperative is not right to only make money. In the future, we should purchase raw materials and promote finished products to serve production." The women's chairman of Xicheng Street also proposed organizing women to spin, boil alum, and refine saltpeter. After discussion, everyone clarified that the future direction of production in the city should be industry-oriented, with commerce serving industry, and that small factories and handicrafts should be developed on a large scale. Cadres from various streets went back and discussed it for a day. Each joint defense held a mass meeting of more than 6,000 people. Activists from various streets put forward production plans at the meeting. For example, Wang Jinsheng from Siqian Street proposed to study using iron looms to weave wide foreign cloth. Women from Mingde Street wanted to organize and establish a shoe shop, where shoe specialists would make shoes, and those who could make soles would make soles. After the meeting, the production movement in various streets was launched successively. Fucai Street established a small towel factory, Mingde Street promoted double-wheel spinning wheels, and many mutual aid groups and weaving groups were established in Nanguan. Production is developing universally.

　　磁县城内确定生产方针
    发展小型工厂作坊
    【本报磁县讯】磁县城经过年来几次斗争，封建剥削问题已大体解决，现正组织进行生产。群运过后，群众对生产方向不明确，一部分群众，且在思想上存在不少顾虑，不敢生产发财。领导上研究了群众具体思想，引导大家讨论为啥要斗争？怎样才能彻底翻身？打破了思想顾虑明确认识了斗争是去绑身绳，要过好时光还得好好生产。当即提出“解了绑身绳，掀了大石板，大家组织起好好闹生产”的口号。接着又讨论城市生产究竟以啥为主？杨得漳说：“以前都是做生意，买卖货靠不住，有时把钱流在外边受人剥削，以后要生产土货。”徐守保说：“咱的合作社光为赚钱也不对，以后购买原料，推销成品为生产服务。”西城街妇女主席也提出组织妇女纺织、熬监熬硝等。经过讨论大家明确了今后城内生产方向以工业为主，商业为工业服务，要大量发展小型工厂及手工业。各街干部回去，酝酿了一天，各联防举行了六千余人的群众大会，各街积极分子在大会上纷纷提出生产计划，如司前街王金生提出要研究以铁轮机织宽面洋布。明德街的妇女要组织成立鞋铺，会上鞋的专门上鞋，会做底的做底等，经过大会动员后，各街生产运动都先后展开，阜才街成立了小型毛巾厂，明德街推广双轮纺车，南关成立了不少互助组，纺织组，生产正在普遍发展中。
