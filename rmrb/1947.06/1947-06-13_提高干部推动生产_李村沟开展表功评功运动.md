　　Promote Production by Cadres
    Licun Village Launches Merit Evaluation Campaign
    [Our Newspaper, Lucheng] After the sowing in Licun Village was completed, the whole village held a two-day conference on the 30th and 31st of last month to summarize the spring production experience, discuss labor exchange, and consolidate mutual aid groups. The masses all said: The women and children have made great contributions, and we should buy straw hats to reward them. Finally, a merit-making campaign was discussed. At the village meeting on June 1st, the leadership explained why we should make merits, combining it with the current situation. In this way, the masses realized that making merits at the front by fighting against Chiang Kai-shek is important, and we in the rear should also make merits by fighting against Chiang Kai-shek. Not only the front can make merits, but also the rear through production. It's not just "production for getting rich," but also for supporting the front in fighting against Chiang Kai-shek. This way, when tasks such as participating in the war and delivering grain come, there will be no complaints like "overturning the world only to end up under the carrying pole," but instead active efforts to overcome difficulties. After a day of commendation, discussion, and evaluation, thirty-eight meritorious individuals were selected. That night, a celebration was held in the courtyard of the headquarters. Liang Madou, a hero of the emancipation, first stated: We must serve the masses even more and run the village's cooperative well, leading all the villagers to make merits. He said, "Red flowers also need green leaves to set them off. Heroes cannot be separated from the masses. We must all make merits and get rich together." Many cadres made profound self-criticisms. An old peasant association member said: "My getting rich through production this spring was a result of being separated from the masses, only caring about myself, like a locomotive running without attaching the train." The meeting lasted until midnight, and the masses said: "Licun Village has become a village of heroes!" Through the commendation, the cadres were united. At this meeting, the masses first affirmed the contributions of the cadres, but also gave the cadres opinions. For example, during the discussion of the village chief Kui Zhi, someone said: "His attitude is not good, only caring about getting rich himself." But someone else said: "His leadership in our emancipation is also a great merit!" Therefore, he was also chosen by more than thirty votes. Liang Suozhi, the group leader, wholeheartedly served the masses this spring, so the masses chose him with sixty-one votes. After the meeting, the cadres all realized that only by wholeheartedly serving the people can they gain the support of the masses. (Shi Chai, Zhang Yi, Xie Ming)
    [Our Newspaper, Changzhi] The Second District, under the circumstances of a severe labor shortage, actively mobilized and organized a comprehensive effort. Before the 25th of last month, within twenty days, they completed the emergency planting of 37,000 mu of millet, nearly 50,000 mu of corn, and 16,000 mu of miscellaneous crops, saving a total of 19,800 labor days. After the sowing was completed, all mutual aid groups and villages in the district launched a summary merit-making and model commendation campaign. A total of 151 model mutual aid groups, 496 production activists, 297 model women, 211 model children, and 135 war participation models were selected. On June 2nd, the district also convened more than 540 various models for a merit-making and model commendation conference. At the beginning of the meeting, everyone did not understand the significance of merit-making and model commendation, and there was a sense of mutual contempt. After discussion, everyone realized that the purpose of commendation was to learn from experience, and the speeches became enthusiastic. Jin Wenli, the village chief of Xinyi Village, said: "After receiving the grain transportation instruction, in order to ensure that the troops at the front did not go hungry, I signed up to go. Then, more than a hundred people volunteered to transport grain. On the road, I went ahead to find pots, get hot water, and find a place. When they arrived, the place was found, and the water was boiling. Gui Bao got sick, so I asked a doctor for him and covered him with my quilt to sweat. He recovered the next day. Jia Lü couldn't carry the load, so I carried it for him. After carrying it, I came back to pick up Bao Wang for four miles, and then came back to pick up another one that was two miles away. In this way, I influenced and organized others to help and take care of each other, and they returned in eight or seven days. When they came back, problems occurred and collapsed in groups seven and eight, so I went down to the cold labor to find the problems, and after solving them, they were consolidated." Guo Gancai said: "Our group had six laborers, and five went to transport grain, so we mobilized six women and two children to work on the land, people pulling plows for six mu of land, calculating work points according to the tasks, two women earning eight points, two earning six points, and children earning five points. In the distribution of dividends, Yuanliang and Pang Nv got all of it, and the rest were divided into two-eight. In this way, more than one hundred mu of autumn land was planted, and the small seedlings emerged from the soil, making everyone very happy." Everyone was vying to speak and vying to commend themselves. After the commendation was discussed and brewed, the conference evaluated the merits, learning from experience with great humility and sincerely pointing out shortcomings. Differing opinions were fiercely debated, and finally thirty-one models were selected. Merit-making and model commendation gave the peasants great encouragement. Guo Shun of Su Village said: "Being a model is more glorious than winning first place in the imperial examination in the past." Hao Quanxi of Renjia Village said: "Next time, we will still compete here under this locust tree." Then, each village set out a weeding plan, aiming for careful cultivation and meticulous work, weeding three times and applying topdressing fertilizer. The entire district will complete the first weeding before the 25th. (Lin Tang, Han Qing, Xing Wang, Ren Xi, Zhu Chang)

　　提高干部推动生产
    李村沟开展表功评功运动
    【本报潞城讯】李村沟下种完后，全村于上月卅日、卅一日，开了两天大会，总结今春的生产经验，讨论变工，整顿互助组，群众都说：妇女儿童功劳大，要买草帽来奖励他们。最后酝酿立功运动，在六月一日的村民会上，领导提出了为啥要立功，跟目前的时局结合起来，这样，群众都认识到前方打老蒋立功，咱后方打老蒋也要立功，不只前方能立功，后方生产也能立功，不单是“为发家而生产”，还要为前方打老蒋。这样在参战送粮等工作来时，不致发生“翻身翻到扁担底下去了”等怨言，而能积极克服困难。经过了一天的表功、讨论、评功，选出了三十八名功臣，当晚，在指挥部院里贺功，翻身英雄梁马斗首先表示：更要为群众服务，把本村的合作社搞好，要带领全村群众都来立功。他说：“红花也要绿叶衬呀，英雄不能离群众，咱们要全村都立功发家。”许多干部都深刻的检讨了自己，老农会说：“我今年春天生产发家就是脱离了群众，只顾自己，像火车头开走了没挂上列车。”开了半夜会，群众说道：“李村沟成了英雄沟啦！”经过表功，干部团结了，这次会上群众首先肯定了干部的功劳，但也给干部提了意见，如在讨论村长奎只时有人说：“他态度不好，只顾自己发家。”但又有人说：“他领导咱们翻身这也是个大功呀！”因此也选了他三十多票。小组长梁锁只今春就全心全意的为群众服务，群众就选了他六十一票。开会后干部们都认识到了只有全心全意的为人民服务，才能得到群众的拥护。（十柴、章沂、谢明）
    【本报长治讯】二区在劳力奇缺的情况下，从积极方面发动全面组织起来，于上月二十五日前，二十天内突击种完谷三万七千余亩，玉茭近五万亩，杂田一万六千余亩，共省一万九千八百余工，下种完后，全区各互助组各村开展总结立功表模运动，共选出模范互助组一百五十一个，生产积极分子四百九十六个，模范妇女二百九十七个，模范儿童二百一十一个，参战模范一百三十五个。六月二日区又召集各种模范五百四十多人，开立功表模大会。会议开始，大家对立功表模的意义未弄明白，有互相看不起的思想，经讨论后，大家认识了表功为了学经验，发言就热烈起来了；信义村长斤文理说：“接到运粮指示后，我为了保证前方军队不饿肚，便报名要去，接着就有一百多人自报去运粮，在路上我先到前边去找锅弄开水找地方，等他们来了，地方找好，水也开了。贵保病了，就给他请医生，把我的被子给他盖上发汗，第二天就好了。甲绿担不动了，我就给他担上，担到后又回来接保王四里地，又回来接一个还差二里路的，这样一来，影响与组织了别人互相接送照顾，该八天七天就回来了。回来时七、八组发生问题垮了，就下冷工发现问题，解决后又巩固起来。”郭赶才说：“我组六个劳力，运粮就走了五个，就发动六个妇女两个儿童上地，人拉犁六亩地，按活计工，两个妇女顶八分，两个顶六分，儿童顶五分，在分红上，元良、胖女是全得，其余都是二八分红，就这样把一百多亩秋地种完，运粮回来小苗出土都很高兴”，都是争着发言抢着表功，表功酝酿后，大会评功，都很虚心的学习经验，诚意的指出缺点，不同意见争论的很厉害，最后选出模范三十一人。立功表模给农民的鼓舞很大，苏店过顺说：“当个模范比过去中个状元还光荣。”任家庄郝全喜说：“再次咱还在这个槐树底下比高低。”接着，各村都订出锄苗计划，要做到精耕细作，锄三遍上补粪。全区在二十五日前，将完成第一次锄苗。（林堂、汗清、兴旺、仁喜、柱长）
