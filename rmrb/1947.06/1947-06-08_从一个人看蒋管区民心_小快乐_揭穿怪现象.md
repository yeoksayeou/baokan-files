　　A Glimpse into the People's Sentiment in the KMT-Controlled Areas from One Person:
    "Little Joy" Exposes Strange Phenomena

　　Little Joy, an entertainer in Shanghai who specializes in singing social news, has recently been persecuted by secret agents. On May 8th, a group of thugs injured his wife and children and destroyed everything in his home. They originally intended to beat Little Joy to death on the spot, but fortunately, Little Joy was out and escaped.

　　Little Joy was originally a street performer in Shanghai known as a "comedian." Since June 1st of last year, he has been broadcasting social news on the privately-owned Triumph Radio Station in Shanghai. The lyrics are all written by him in popular language based on various popular songs and folk tunes, and the broadcasts are very popular every day. He has sung "Stop the Civil War Song," "Return My Freedom," "Grain Loan Case," "Glass World," "The End of the Chinese Market," "National Demeanor," and others. Unlike some other "comedians," he does not imitate the sounds of cats, dogs, or trains. He only sings about strange social phenomena. He said: "Strange phenomena after victory, how can one describe them all at once? I am also a member of the people, a bone stuck in my throat makes it itch... I only hope to establish a democratic country, and do not want to see strange phenomena again." (See Little Joy's "Strange Social Phenomena," page 3.)

　　Little Joy is therefore hated by the groups that create strange phenomena in society, and is often threatened and enticed.

　　At the first session of the KMT's Shanghai Municipal Council, lackey Councilor Lu Keming proposed that the broadcasting programs of Shanghai's private radio stations should be reviewed, and specifically pointed out that programs such as "Strange Social Phenomena" contain "political functions" and should be strictly banned. After hearing this, Little Joy thought, "Why not truly solicit public opinion?" So he rebroadcast Lu Keming's proposal on the air, and then solicited opinions from the audience: "Do you agree with Mr. Lu's proposal?"

　　As soon as Little Joy solicited opinions, listeners (including civil servants, students, shop assistants, teachers, and even veterans) called, wrote letters, and came to the radio station: to firmly oppose Lu Keming's proposal. One hundred percent enthusiastically supported Little Joy's singing of strange social phenomena! The phone rang constantly, with more than a hundred calls a day to express condolences, and claiming to be willing to be his backing, and never be intimidated by evil forces. Letters and telegrams from listeners outside Shanghai flew in like snowflakes. A telegram from Ningbo read: "Support Little Joy, oppose banning" and several other large characters. The name was the entire townspeople of a certain town. A letter of condolence from Suzhou explained that the sender was a relative of Lu Keming; and attached a photo of Lu Keming for his reference. Some people wrote to newspapers to express their grievances. There was also an enthusiastic listener who made a scene at the radio station, insisting on speaking in front of the microphone to oppose Lu Keming's bastard proposal. - This is the public opinion of Shanghai. On the other hand, people from the Kuomintang Social Bureau came to talk to him.

　　The official said: "Although your lyrics are based on social news in the newspapers, you should see clearly which newspapers they are. They cannot be used as a basis casually."

　　Little Joy said: "What I am based on are newspapers such as Ta Kung Pao and Wen Hui Pao, all of which have been approved and registered by the government as legal newspapers."

　　The official said again: "You cannot attack arbitrarily, otherwise you will be held legally responsible."

　　Little Joy said: "Sir, I have not studied law... But to say that I have political implications, to give me a big hat, is really eight feet in the sky, I don't know where to start!"

　　At the same time, the lackeys also warned him by phone: "Be sensible! Your life is in danger!" Some went directly to his house and threatened his wife rudely: "Is he still going to sing? Does he want his life or not?"

　　Pan Gongzhan, the Kuomintang CC faction's special agent in charge of persecuting culture, also jumped up in a hurry and issued a statement to the press: "Councilors' speeches at the meeting are not legally responsible to the outside world... The troupe publicly insulted and obstructed reputation and can be prosecuted according to law. The content of the program should be carefully reviewed responsibly, and if there are any violations of the law, it can be banned according to law. If there are any inappropriate actions by the broadcasting troupe, the authorities will not sit idly by."

　　However, Little Joy continued to sing, sing, until now.

　　He sang about the golden tide made by the four major families.

　　He sang about the rice shortage in the KMT-controlled areas where people were struggling to survive.

　　So on the eighth of this month, secret agents openly held weapons and rushed in: beating, destroying... But Little Joy was not intimidated. He knew who he should rely on. That evening, he turned the ordeal into lyrics and broadcast them to the audience on the radio. As a result, in less than half an hour, there were dozens of phone calls of condolence. Various labor unions, shops, and people from all walks of life expressed their support, unanimously demanding a thorough investigation of the case and severe punishment of the thugs.

　　In the struggle with Lu Keming in October last year, he said painfully: "It's okay to ban my broadcast, it's okay to give me a big hat, what can I do? I am a person who 'eats by opening my mouth', without wealth or power, my last resort is 'group suicide'. On the one hand, it is because my whole family depends on me for survival, and starving one person is equal to starving a family. On the other hand! Use 'group suicide' to accuse this society full of strange phenomena! I am not making dangerous words. I have this 'guts' and preparation. Furthermore, if there are no more strange phenomena in society after the ban, and it is bright, I can stop immediately. But if I don't sing, society is still full of dark and strange phenomena, what can I do?"

　　This is a sharp remark. Chiang Kai-shek and the four major families create endless strange phenomena every day, how can Little Joy not sing? This is not just one person singing. Little Joy is the common voice of so many social strata in the KMT-controlled areas.

　　从一个人看蒋管区民心
    “小快乐”揭穿怪现象
    上海专唱社会新闻的艺人小快乐，最近遭受了特务的迫害。五月八日，一群暴徒把他的妻子和小孩打伤，并把家中一切物件捣毁。原本企图将小快乐当场打死，幸亏小快乐外出，得免于难。
    小快乐原是一个被上海人称为“滑稽家”的卖唱艺人。自去年六月一日起，在上海民营的凯旋广播电台播唱一些社会新闻。唱词都是他根据各种流行歌曲与民间小调用通俗口语填写的，每天播唱极受欢迎。他唱过“停止内战曲”“还我自由”“粮贷案”“玻璃世界”“中国市场的末路”“大国民风度”等。和其他一些同行的“滑稽家”不同，他不学猫、狗、火车叫等口技。而只唱社会怪现象。他说：“胜利之后怪现象，一时岂能道端详，敝人也是国民一分子，骨梗在喉喉咙痒……但愿确立民主国，勿愿再见怪现象。”（见小快乐著《社会怪现象》第三页。）
    小快乐因此为社会制造怪现象的集团所痛恨，经常受到威胁和利诱。
    蒋记上海市首届参议会上，走狗参议员陆克明提出：上海市民营电台播音节目应该审查，并特别指出“社会怪现象”等节目含有“政治作用”，应严加取缔。小快乐听说以后想：“何必不真正的征求一下民意呢！”于是在播音台上把陆克明的提议转播一番，接着便向听众征求意见：“诸位对陆先生的提案赞成不？”
    小快乐的征求意见一出，听众（包括公务员、学生、店员、教师乃至退伍军人）都纷纷给他打电话、写信，到广播台来：坚决反对陆克明的提议。百分之百的热烈拥护小快乐唱社会怪现象！电话铃不断的响，每天有百余起电话来慰问，并声称愿意作他的后盾，千万不要被恶势力吓倒。外埠听众的快信，电报也如雪片飞来。一封来自宁波的电报，文为：“拥护小快乐，反对取缔”等几个大字。具名是某镇全体镇民。苏州寄来的有一封慰问信，说明自己（发信人）是陆克明的亲戚；并附上陆克明的照片一张，供他做识别的参考。还有人来信请他编唱“自来火洋腊买来的参议员”，信中愤慨的指出上海蒋记参议员，大都是拿自来火和洋腊贿赂选民买来的。有不少人投函报纸，代抱不平。还有一位热情的听众，到电台上大吵大闹，一定要亲自到播音机前去发言反对陆克明的混蛋提案。——这，就是上海的民意。然而另一面，国民党社会局来人找他谈话。
    官说：“你的唱词虽然根据报上的社会新闻，但是你该看清楚，是那些报纸，不能随便作为根据的。”
    小快乐说：“我所根据的是大公、文汇等报，都是经过政府核准过，登记过的合法报纸。”
    官又说：“你不能任意攻击，否则你要负法律上的责任。”
    小快乐说：“先生我不曾读过法律书。………但是说我有政治意味，给我戴大帽子，真是悬天八只脚，不知道话从何谈起！”
    同时狗腿们也用电话警告他：“识相点！性命堪虞！”有的直接跑到他家里，对他的妻子粗声粗气的威胁：“阿是伊还要唱呵？伊到底性命要不要？”（意即：他可是还要唱呵？他到底要命不要？）
    国民党ＣＣ派迫害文化的特务头子潘公展也急得跳起来，向报界发表谈话：“参议员在会场发言，依法对外不负责任………该剧团公然侮辱，妨碍名誉，可依法控诉。其节目内容确应注意负责审查，倘有违背法律之处，当可依法取缔。播音剧团如有不合举动，主官当局谅亦不致坐视也。”
    然而小快乐还是在唱，唱，直到现在。
    他唱了四大家族手造的黄金潮。
    他唱了蒋管区民不聊生的米荒。
    于是在本月八日特务公然手持武器一拥而入：殴打，捣毁………。但是小快乐并没被吓倒，他知道他应该依靠的是谁。下午的暴行，当晚他就把被难经过编成唱词，在播音机对听众们播唱了。结果是还不到半小时，打电话慰问的有数十起。各工会、商店及各界人士纷纷声援，一致要求彻查此案并严惩暴徒。
    在去年十月里与陆克明斗争时，他曾沉痛的说：“要取缔我播唱也好，给我戴大帽子也好，我有什么办法呢？我是一个‘吃开口饭”的人，无财无势，我的最后一着是‘集团自杀’。一方面是因为全家人都靠我活命，饿死一个等于饿死一家。一方面呢！以‘集团自杀’来控诉这充满着怪现象的社会！我这样说不是故作危词。我有这个‘种气’与准备。再如果禁止播唱之后，社会上就此没有怪现象了，就此大放光明了，我可以立即停止。但是我不唱，社会上仍是充满着黑暗的怪现象，这又有什么办法呢？”
    这真是一针见血的话，蒋介石和四大家族天天制造不完的怪现象，可怎能叫小快乐不唱呢？这不是一个人在唱，小快乐，他是多么广大的蒋区各社会阶层共同的一个喉咙啊。
