Qinyang Chengguan District Army and Civilians Crush Enemy's Grain-Snatching Plan

[Our Dispatch] Under the organization and leadership of Li Jiacheng, the head of Chengguan District, with the support of the masses from the first and second districts, and the full participation of the armed work team and the independent battalion, a total of 3,500 people were organized on the night of June 3rd. In two hours at Shuibeiguan (a stronghold of stubborn reactionaries and puppets) and Zhang Shizi, 500 mu of wheat that had been seized from the masses by counter-revolutionaries were recovered, enough to thresh 300 shi of wheat. During the harvesting, the stubborn puppet troops heard the sound and retreated into the blockhouse, without firing a single shot.

When the wheat was almost ripe, the enemy in the city organized grain-snatching teams, etc., preparing to seize wheat on a large scale. Most of the masses were afraid that the wheat would not be harvested. Comrade Jiacheng, the district head, immediately discussed with district and village cadres, accepted the opinions of the masses, and arranged the work of protecting the wheat harvest as soon as possible. The methods were: (1) Each village needs to combine labor and military force; (2) Voluntary mutual assistance, men, women, old and young go to the fields together, getting up early and working late without rest; (3) Destroying roads to obstruct and delay the enemy's advance; (4) Roadside mine blockades, arranged into minefields, deploying mine nets, and building mine walls; (5) Strengthening sentry posts, strictly enforcing martial law, armed support, and harvesting at night; (6) Ensuring rapid harvesting, threshing, and hiding, with each person hiding their own, no one knowing who else is hiding, everyone keeping the secret, and no one allowed to leak information. In addition, all armed district cadre teams were organized to operate near the enemy strongholds to attack the enemy's grain-snatching teams, etc. District cadres persisted in leading and participating in the mass harvesting in the villages.

When the masses in various villages were worried about how to harvest the wheat of the fugitive households, Comrade Jiacheng immediately researched with district and county cadres and decided on the "Measures for Handling the Wheat of Struggle Objects Who Have Fled to the City," which was promptly announced to the masses. The methods were: (1) If the entire family of the struggle object has fled into the city without being struggled against, and the wheat is near the stronghold, we will organize the masses to harvest it, with the laborers receiving 60% and the public 40%. (2) For basic masses who have been forced or deceived into fleeing into the city with their entire families, their wheat can be harvested by the masses, with the laborers receiving 30% and the owner receiving 70%; in addition to paying public grain, it will be completely kept in custody on their behalf. After these measures were decided, the masses further recognized our policies, and the masses in various villages reflected: "These measures are really good, now all the people who ran into the city will have to come back."

The entire Chengguan District masses, after our full efforts to seize the harvest and solve the problem of fugitive households' wheat, had high morale. With men, women, old and young working together in all villages, they seized the harvest day and night, and the wheat was harvested around the 6th. The 500 mu of wheat one li away from the enemy in Shuibeiguan and Beijin Village was also harvested by our second and third district assistance teams, working day and night. The masses who were deceived into running into the city returned one after another, with more than a hundred people returning to Zhang Shizi Village alone. The enemy's plan to seize wheat from our first district (Chengguan District) was completely crushed by us.

After the victory of protecting the wheat, everyone knew that the enemy would desperately struggle to retaliate, and the masses in the entire district consciously and quickly launched a grain-hiding campaign.

　　沁阳城关区军民粉碎敌抢麦计划
    【本报讯】沁阳城关区在区长李嘉诚组织领导下，并有一、二区群众的支援，以及武工队、独立营的全部参加，共组织了三千五百人，于六月三日夜，在水北关（顽伪据点）、张十字用两点钟工夫，收回倒算分子倒去群众的麦子五百亩，能打麦三百石。割收中，顽伪军闻声钻进了炮楼里，一枪未响。
    麦子快黄时，城内敌人组织抢麦队等，准备大肆抢麦，群众大都害怕麦子收不到家，区长嘉诚同志即与区村干部研究接受群众意见及早将保卫麦收工作布置了。办法：（一）各村都需劳力与武力结合组织；（二）自愿互助，男女老少一齐下地，起早搭黑不能闲；（三）破路阻止与延迟敌人前进；（四）路上地雷封锁，摆成地雷阵，布置地雷网，垒成地雷墙；（五）加强岗哨，厉行戒严，武装撑腰，黑夜收割；（六）保证作到快收快打快藏，藏时各人藏各人的，谁也不知道谁，大家保守秘密，谁也不准透风。另外组织所有武装区干队等到敌据点附近活动，打击敌抢麦队等。区干部都在村坚持领导与参加群众收麦。
    在各村群众发愁怎样收逃亡户的麦子时，嘉诚同志即先与区县干部研究，定出了“对于已经逃跑到城内的斗争对象麦子的处理办法”，及时向群众公布。其办法是：（一）斗争对象全家逃跑进城未经斗过，麦子在据点附近，我们组织群众收割，劳力得六成，公家四成。（二）对基本群众被迫被骗全家逃进城内者，其麦子可让群众收割，劳工得三成，本人得七成；除交公粮外，完全给他们代为保管。这办法定出后，群众对我们政策更进一步认识，各村群众反映：“这办法真好，这一下跑进城的人都要回来。”
    整个城关区群众在我全力抢收与解决逃户麦子问题后，群众情绪高涨，各村都在男女老少一齐干的情况下，日夜抢收，麦子均在六日前后收完，水北关、北金村离敌一里许的麦子五百亩，也为我二、三区助收队星夜收完。受骗跑进城去的群众纷纷归来，只张十字村就回来了百余人。敌人对我一区（城关区）的抢麦计划，完全被我粉碎。
    保麦胜利之后，大家知道敌人要拚命挣扎报复，全区群众已自觉、迅速的展开藏粮运动。
