　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: TASS, Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov replied to questions posed by Mr. Luger, a special correspondent for the Parisian newspaper L'Humanité. The reporter asked: Do you believe that Bulgaria's cultural ties with France can and must be restored and developed? Dimitrov replied: Yes, I believe so. When asked about the basic direction of Bulgarian foreign policy, Dimitrov said: The basic direction of Bulgarian foreign policy can be clearly summarized as follows: First, to ensure the freedom, independence, and national sovereignty of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Second, to facilitate the establishment of a lasting and democratic peace by all means, based on international cooperation, and to facilitate participation in the struggle against instigators of new wars as much as possible. Third, to prevent Bulgaria from being turned into a forward base of hostile acts against our liberator—the great Soviet people—and other Slavic and non-Slavic democratic countries. Precisely for this reason, the sacred friendship with the Soviet people, the fraternal relationship with other Slavic countries, and the friendship with other democratic countries, large and small, based on mutual respect and faithful cooperation, have become the cornerstone of our foreign policy. No foreign pressure or inducement can force Bulgaria to abandon this course in her foreign policy; this course has been affirmed by the historical experience of the Bulgarian people. The hostile attitude of certain reactionary groups towards our People's Republic can only increase our people's determination to adhere to this national democratic and peaceful foreign policy, which guarantees the security of our country and people. When asked about the most important work currently facing the Fatherland Front government, Prime Minister Dimitrov replied: The basic task of the entire people is to implement the National Economic Two-Year Plan passed by the National Assembly. This plan is to pave the way for the country's economic development and the people's prosperity. Finally, Dimitrov spoke in detail about the reasons for, the process of, and the attitude towards the arrest of the traitor Nikola Petkov.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS, Sofia: The Supreme Council of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union has elected the Central Bureau of the Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. The bureau has held its first meeting, at which Alexander Obov, Georgi Dragnev, and Georgi Draikov were elected as political secretaries of the Central Bureau.

　　保加利亚外交政策基本方向：
    与苏及一切民主国合作坚决反对新战争煽动者
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社索非亚讯：保总理季米特洛夫答复巴黎人道报特派记者卢格尔所提之问题。记者问：你是否以为保加利亚与法国文化联系可以而且必须加以恢复和发展？答：是，我以为是这样。记者问到关于保加利亚外交政策的基本方向，季氏答称：保加利亚外交政策的基本方向可以明白简述如下：第一，要保证保加利亚人民共和国的自由独立和国家主权。第二，要在国际合作之基础上，便利于用一切方法建立持久的民主和平，并要便利于尽一切可能的参加对新战争煽动者之斗争。第三，要防止保加利亚被变为反对我们的解放者——伟大的苏联人民——以及其他斯拉夫和非斯拉夫民主国之仇视行为的前进基地。正因为这个理由，所以与苏联人民间之神圣友谊，与其他斯拉夫国家兄弟般之关系，以及基于互相尊重及忠诚合作而与其他大小民主国家间之友谊，这些就成了我们外交政策的基石。没有一种外来的压力和利诱能够强迫保加利亚放弃她外交政策中的这个路线；这一路线又是保加利亚人民的历史经验加以肯定了的。某些反动集团对于我们人民共和国的仇视态度，只能增加我们人民的决心去坚守这个民族民主与和平的外交政策，这一政策保证我们国家和人民的安全。记者问及关于目前面临祖国阵线政府的最重大的工作，季米特洛夫总理回答说：全国人民的基本工作，就是实行国民大会所通过的国民经济二年计划。这个计划是为了给国家的经济之发达与人民的繁荣铺好道路。最后，季米特洛夫详谈关于逮捕叛国罪犯尼古拉·彼特可夫之原因、经过及处置态度。
