　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. TASS dispatch: Alexander Trofimov, in an article in Pravda entitled "The Shameless Provocation of the Chinese Reactionaries," stated: "Recently, the Kuomintang newspapers in China, as if hearing a signal, suddenly clamored about 'Soviet aggression,' and an emergency measure is being implemented to confuse public opinion. Personnel from the 'Bureau of Investigation and Statistics' (note: this refers to the Kuomintang secret service organization that habitually appears in various guises - original note) are fabricating declarations from various 'people's organizations,' repeating malicious anti-Soviet slanders. Even Sun Ke, the Vice President of the Chinese government, has joined this chorus of anti-Soviet slander. There was a time when he pretended to be a progressive mass leader, boasting and reveling in left-leaning rhetoric. Now, Sun Ke no longer pretends to be a democrat; instead, he is begging the US government not only to strengthen its assistance to the Kuomintang reactionary regime but also not to demand any democratic reforms from this reactionary regime. The first objective of this fierce rumor offensive launched by the Chinese reactionaries is: they must quickly find an 'objective explanation' and a suitable justification for the military defeats they have suffered in the civil war against the Chinese democratic forces and the collapse of their plans. Everyone knows that since the Japanese surrender, the Nanjing government has been continuously receiving military and financial assistance from the US government, as a result of which the Kuomintang army has a great material and technical advantage over the People's Liberation Army. This favorable condition has intoxicated the Kuomintang adventurers. In March of this year, they decided to go all out, staking everything on one throw, to 'finally defeat militarily' the People's Liberation Army. They shouted to the world that they would be able to do this within three months after their army's surprise attack on Yan'an. The occupation of Yan'an on March 19th was Chiang Kai-shek's last 'victory' (a victory in brackets), a victory that the London Times called the tip of the pyramid. This was immediately followed by a series of defeats for the Kuomintang army in Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Rehe, and the Northeast, under the blows of the People's Liberation Army with the assistance of the militia. In order to maintain its prestige in front of its American creditors, the reactionaries felt compelled to quickly come up with a suitable 'objective reason' for their military bankruptcy. Dong Xian Guang, a spokesman for the Nanjing government, issued a provocative statement at a press conference, which was published by all Kuomintang newspapers. The statement said: 'A certain party is rearming, equipping, and even directly leading the Red Army in the Northeast.' The Kuomintang Central News Agency, with the active help of the American Associated Press, spread arrogant reports, saying: 'The Soviet Union had planned, and is now directing, the offensive of the Chinese Communist troops in Manchuria, and is assisting this offensive with 30,000 Japanese prisoners of war and 90 tanks driven by Soviet and Japanese prisoners.' The Stars and Stripes, the official newspaper of the US occupation authorities headquarters in Japan, published this rumor. Finally, on June 5th, Chinese border troops stationed in Xinjiang invaded the Mongolian People's Republic in the Baitag Bogda Mountains (known as Beita Mountain in China - original note) area and provoked an armed conflict with the border guards of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Central News Agency openly distorted the facts and added its own fabrications, saying that four Soviet aircraft were said to have covered the invasion by Mongolian troops, and portrayed this provocation by the Chinese reactionaries as a Soviet 'threat to Chinese sovereignty.' In this anti-Soviet propaganda and provocation, the Nanjing government requested a loan of US$500 million from the US Export-Import Bank just in those days. According to a report in the American Afternoon Newspaper, representatives of the Nanjing government are negotiating new loans with the US government. All this shows with complete clarity the main motive of the Chinese reactionaries' anti-Soviet provocation: they are trying at any cost to obtain 'evidence' to convince American taxpayers that China needs money because she is supposedly in danger of 'external aggression' from the Soviet Union. The Kuomintang reactionaries are most afraid that American businessmen may realize that the United States has 'bet the wrong horse' in China and may refuse to speculate with large bets again. Another reason prompting the Chinese reactionaries to engage in anti-Soviet adventures is that they are trying to divert the Chinese people's attention from the worsening domestic situation with these external provocations. When hungry people began to smash rice shops in many cities, including Nanjing, the Kuomintang authorities once again clamored about Communist conspiracies, and the police machine-gunned the starving masses. Chinese students have risen to fight, insisting on stopping the civil war that deprives them of their livelihood and destroys their studies. The answer they received was that the students' disturbances were also caused by a 'Communist conspiracy.' This is the excuse used by the Chinese reactionaries whenever they come into conflict with their own people. Needless to say, this method will not enhance the Chinese reactionaries' domestic position, nor will it enhance their prestige abroad.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. TASS, New York, 27th. Several major New York newspapers refuted the Chiang government's official accusations that the Soviet Union was helping the Chinese Communists. A recent report by Raymond, the New York Herald Tribune's correspondent in Shenyang, stated that he could not confirm any claims that the Soviet Union was supplying weapons to the Chinese Communists. Raymond ridiculed the propaganda that "Russia controls the activities of the Communists in the Northeast." The reporter criticized the Kuomintang officials and technicians for their inability to solve the industrial and other economic problems in the Northeast. Lewis, the editor of the New York Afternoon Newspaper, also recently wrote an article pointing out that no reporter could confirm the rumor that the Soviet Union was supplying weapons to the Chinese Communists, although the reward for doing so would be very high. Four capable and experienced reporters, including a reporter from the Chicago Sun, claimed that they had no concrete evidence to confirm the Kuomintang's anti-Soviet rumors.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. According to the US News Agency on the 26th: An editorial in the New York Herald Tribune, a Republican Party organ that has always supported Chiang Kai-shek, criticized Nanjing officials for attributing Chiang's army's failures to Soviet aid to the CCP, saying: "In the war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China, the Kuomintang army (Chiang's army) has repeatedly suffered defeats." "Nanjing should blame its failures on the Kuomintang government's (referring to the Chiang government) unpopularity, corruption, and incompetence, rather than blaming the Soviet Union." "Many evils in China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) are blamed on the Communist Party, but it is unreasonable to say that Chiang Kai-shek and others are forced by the Communist Party to employ stupid and rogue people." The newspaper continued: "Recently, inflation in China (referring to the KMT-controlled areas) has made survival even more difficult, social chaos has prevailed, and moral standards have declined. Corruption, incompetence, looting, and lack of a proper purpose are all obvious. All criticisms are correct." The newspaper concluded: "No matter how much external assistance is provided, it will not be able to compensate for the mistakes of the Chinese ruling class (referring to the Four Big Families). Loans or grants to China are not appropriate today."

### 蒋党制造反苏挑拨诽谤  掩饰战争败绩博取美元  苏联真理报著文揭穿  美报识破蒋党骗局斥其反苏毫无根据

　　蒋党制造反苏挑拨诽谤
    掩饰战争败绩博取美元
    苏联真理报著文揭穿
    美报识破蒋党骗局斥其反苏毫无根据
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社讯：亚历山大特罗夫顷以“中国反动派的无耻挑拨”为题，于真理报著文称：近来中国各国民党报纸，好像听着信号一样，突然叫嚣起“苏联的侵略”，一种紧急的办法正在实施，用来迷惑舆论。“调查统计局”（按：即惯以各种面目出现的国民党特务机关——原注）的人员，制造各种“人民团体”的宣言，重复着恶意的反苏诽谤。甚至中国政府的副主席孙科，也参加进这反苏诽谤的合唱里。从前有一个时候，他曾经伪装着是进步的群众领袖，并夸夸其谈的讲些左倾的辞句自鸣得意。现在孙科不再装做是民主人士，反而乞求美国政府不仅要加强对国民党反动政权的援助，而且还要他们不要向这个反动政权要求无论任何种的民主改革。中国反动派发动的这个猛烈的谣言攻势，其第一个目的就是：他们必须赶紧为他们在进攻中国民主力量的内战中所遭受的军事失败和他们计划的崩溃，找出“客观的解释”和适当的辩护理由。大家都知道，自从日本投降以来，南京政府就一直无间断地受到美国政府的军事和财政援助，其结果国民党军队握有了较人民解放军在物质上和技术上很大优势。这种有利条件，冲昏了国民党冒险家的头脑。今年三月间，他们决定倾全力孤注一掷，要“最后在军事上击败”人民解放军。他们对世界喊叫，在他们的军队奇袭延安后三个月之内，他们就能做到这一点。三月十九日占领延安是蒋介石最后一次的“胜利”（括号中的胜利），是伦敦泰晤士报称之为金字塔尖的胜利。这以后紧跟着的就是国民党军队在陕西、山东、河北、热河和东北等地在人民解放军在民兵协助下的打击底下一连串的失败。反动派为了要维持在美国债主面前的威信，感到不得不赶紧想出他们军事破产的适当的“客观原因”。南京政府发言人董显光在记者招待会上发表挑拨性声明，全部国民党报纸均竞为登载，该声明说：“某方正在重新武装、装备甚至直接领导东北的红军。”国民党中央社在美国美联社积极帮助下，散布狂妄报导，说：“苏联曾计划，现在并正在指挥满洲中共军队的攻势，并以日本战俘三万人及由苏联与日俘驾驶之坦克九十辆，协助这一攻势。”驻日美国占领当局总部机关报星条报刊载了这个谣言。最后，六月五日中国驻新疆边防部队在白塔克·波格达（中国称为北塔山——原注）山脉地区，侵入蒙古人民共和国，并挑起和蒙古人民共和国边防军的武装冲突。中央社公然歪曲事实，又加上它自己的捏造，说什么有四架苏联飞机，据说曾掩护蒙古军的侵入，并把中国反动派这种挑拨说成是苏联“对中国主权的威胁”。在这种反苏的宣传和挑拨中，南京政府就在那几天要求取得美国进出口银行为数达五万万美元的贷款。据美国下午报报导，南京政府代表正在和美国政府商谈新的贷款。这一切以彻底的清晰性显示了中国反动派反苏挑拨的主要动机，他们试图不惜任何代价获取“证据”来说服美国纳税人：中国需要金钱，因为据说她是处在来自苏联的“外部侵略”的危险中。国民党反动派最害怕的是：美国的商人也许会认清美国在中国“押错了宝”，因而可能拒绝再以大笔赌注来投机。促使中国反动派从事反苏冒险的还有另一个原因，他们试图以这些外界的挑拨，来转移中国人民对于国内形势日渐恶化的注意。当饥饿的人民开始在许多城市，包括南京，捣毁米店的时候，国民党当局再次大肆叫嚣共产党阴谋，而警察则以机枪扫射饥馑的群众。中国学生起来斗争，坚持停止剥夺他们的生存与破坏他们的学业的内战。他们得到的答复是，学生的骚扰也是“共产党阴谋”造成的。这就是每当中国反动派在他们与其本国人民发生冲突时所用的遁辞。无庸说，此种方法并不能增强中国反动派在国内的地位，也不能提高它在国外的威信。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】塔斯社纽约二十七日电：纽约若干大报驳斥蒋政府官方所谓苏联帮助中国共产党的责难。纽约前锋论坛报驻沈阳记者雷德最近报导称：他不能证实任何一件苏联供给中共武器的说法。雷氏嘲笑所谓“俄国控制东北共产党活动”的宣传。该记者抨击国民党官吏及技术人员无能解决东北的工业及其他经济问题。纽约下午报编辑刘易士最近亦撰文指出，没有一个记者能够证实苏联供给中共武器之谣言，虽然作这种证实是能获得最高的报酬。四个有能力有经验的记者，其中包括芝加哥太阳报的记者宣称：他们无论如何没有具体的证据去证实国民党的反苏谣言。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】据美新闻处二十六日电：一向支持蒋介石的共和党机关报纽约前锋论坛报社论抨击南京官员将蒋军失败归因于苏联对中共援助之论调称：“在中国国共对战中，国军（蒋军）屡遭败绩”。“南京遭受之败绩与其归咎于苏联，不如归罪于国民政府（指蒋政府）之不孚众望及腐败与无能”。“中国有不少恶事，均被诿过于共产党，但蒋介石等任用愚蠢及无赖之人，若谓系受共产党所强迫，此种谎言殊不合理。”该报继称：“最近中国（指蒋管区）通货膨胀，倍使求生不易，社会混乱，道德标准沦亡殆尽，贪污、无能、掠劫、缺乏正当目的，皆至显然。一切抨击均属正确”。该报结语称：“不论多大外来之援助，终不能弥补中国统治阶级（指四大家族）之过失。对华贷款或赠予，今日并不适宜”。
