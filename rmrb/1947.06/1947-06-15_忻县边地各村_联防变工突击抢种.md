Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th. Villages such as Tulingqiao and Liushi in the border areas of Xin County, under the leadership of the district work team, armed guerrillas, and village governments, have established joint defense and labor exchange production. When a situation occurs, the people and livestock of the front-line villages are transferred to the second-line villages to cultivate under the cover of the militia. After the enemy is repelled, the people and livestock of the second-line then help the front-line villages with crash planting. In five days, the three villages have rushed to plant more than a thousand mu of autumn crops. They have also liquidated feudal landlords, distributed land, livestock, food, and farm tools, and solved the difficulties of poor farmers in spring plowing. The county has also organized old areas to help the newly recovered Qicun Town area with cultivation. The masses in the third district of the neighboring Guo County have also organized a plowing assistance team of 134 livestock to go to the area to help with plowing.

    联防变工突击抢种
    【新华社晋绥八日电】忻县边沿土凌桥、六石等村，在区工作组武装游击村公所领导下，建立联防变工生产。发生情况时前沿村庄人畜在民兵掩护下即转移到第二线村庄耕种，敌人击退后第二线的人畜再帮助前沿村突击。五天内三个村已抢种秋季作物千余亩。并清算封建地主，分配土地、牲畜、食粮和农具，解决贫苦农民春耕困难。该县并组织老区帮助新收复区奇村镇一带耕种。毗邻之崞县三区群众，亦组织一三十四头牲畜的助耕队前往该地助耕。
