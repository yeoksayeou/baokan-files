　　The Banner of Yangcheng's Laboring Women:
    Bai Rusai Women's Mutual Aid Team
    Fourth Administrative Office of the Taiyue Region
    Bai Rusai lives in Lujiahe Village, a subordinate village of Yanshan Village in the Sixth District of Yangcheng County. Thanks to the help of cadres and the lead of activists, all 140 male and female full and semi-laborers in the village have been organized, and Bai Rusai's women's mutual aid group has become a banner among the laboring women of Yangcheng. Here are some of their main characteristics for reference.
    Women's Mutual Aid Faces Many Difficulties, Men Come to Help
    The women here have never had the custom of working in the fields. Women only manage household affairs, spinning, weaving, cooking, and taking care of children. Even with the annual silkworm raising, the men have to bring back the mulberry leaves for the women to feed the silkworms. Last February, Production Committee member Lu Sihe returned from training in the county and realized that this year, in order to achieve liberation (mass movement), fight wars, and not delay production, it would be necessary to organize women. However, when he raised this issue at the winter school, he faced many difficulties, and the masses had no confidence. The men thought that women were "family members" and didn't count for much in the fields. The mothers-in-law were afraid that if their daughters-in-law went to the fields, they would have to cook and take care of the children themselves. The women also felt that going to the fields was difficult, they lacked strength, and didn't know how to do it. Comrade Lu Sihe felt that just talking wouldn't work, so he decided to first help the activists to see if it was feasible. He felt that helping Bai Rusai was the most appropriate because: First, Bai Rusai was upright and steady, not afraid of gossip, the women's association group leader, and the most capable of uniting women. Second, her family was harmonious and progressive, her husband was a militiaman, and her in-laws were very virtuous. Third, she was a 23-year-old young woman, had no children, had unbound feet, and was usually willing to work. When he talked to Bai Rusai, Rusai was very willing. "When you came back from the county and said it, I was willing, but I didn't dare to speak because I saw that everyone else was unwilling." Comrade Sihe discussed with Bai Rusai to first mobilize the young women in the family who could be spared to participate in the mutual aid group. Finally, Sihe told Rusai, "It's okay, you take the lead, and if you encounter any difficulties or problems, I'll help you." Bai Rusai went to mobilize them one by one, and a total of five people were mobilized, but these people also lacked confidence. "What can we do if we go to the fields?" Comrade Sihe told them, "Field work isn't difficult. If we can't do skillful or heavy work, can't we first do some light and rough work? Let's first go to the fields to tramp the grain and see if it works." So the men's mutual aid group planted in front, and the women trampled behind, and they trampled very well. The women said, "This isn't difficult!" After the grain was planted, it was time to hoe the wheat. The women were again afraid that they wouldn't hoe well. Comrade Sihe said, "It's easy to hoe, I'll teach you." The five women hoeed 35.7 mu of wheat land for five households, and their morale was high. They also voluntarily proposed to help the Jin Ke group hoe 3 mu of wheat, earning 9 sheng of wage rice. This time, all the women in the village started talking, "Aren't they women too? How are they different from us? How can we let them earn our millet!" Then 31 young women participated in the mutual aid group, divided into three groups. Everyone elected Comrade Bai Rusai as the captain, and each mutual aid group elected a skilled man to specifically lead the women to work in the fields, telling them how to do the work. This gradually made the women learn general labor skills.
    Family Profit Sharing and Courtyard Labor Exchange
    At the beginning of the mutual aid, although it was stipulated that women would earn wages the same way when they worked in the fields, all the wages earned by women were owned by the men due to past traditional habits, which caused problems after a few days. The women stopped attending mutual aid group meetings, and middle-aged women were unwilling to work in the fields, saying that their feet were small, they had children, and they couldn't leave due to the scattered household chores. Later, Lu Sihe and Bai Rusai convened meetings and had heart-to-heart talks with everyone, and they realized that the women felt that whether they worked or not, it had nothing to do with them, and they couldn't see or spend the money they earned. Only then did they realize that in order to get women to work hard, the money they earned should belong to the women themselves. But the men were unwilling, saying, "They eat and drink at home, and the money they earn is theirs. They're the only ones who get to count the money." So, according to the opinions of both parties, it was decided through negotiation that the women's wages would be split 40/60 with the family (women get 40%). As a result, women scrambled to join the mutual aid group.
    With this problem solved, another difficult problem arose: the women all wanted to work in the fields, but no one was taking care of the cooking and child care at home, which stumped everyone. Another characteristic of this area is that there are many small families, usually a husband and wife with some young children, and few sisters-in-law living together. In addition, there are seven or eight families living in the same courtyard, upstairs and downstairs. Later, they researched a way for women to exchange labor, leaving only one or two people at home to cook and take care of the children, and the rest went to the fields. The people at home also earned work points from the people in the fields for cooking and taking care of the children, depending on the situation. For example, if you cook for five people, I'll give you two work points a day. This way, a large number of women can be freed up to work in the fields.
    "Rusai is Really Good!"
    When the masses of Lujiahe mention Rusai, they all say in unison: "Rusai is really good!" Why is she so supported by the masses?
    First of all, she is always concerned about the suffering of women and always understands their difficulties. She was afraid that children would get asthma and get sick from drinking milk, so she discussed with everyone and decided that women who were breastfeeding children would not go to the fields at noon. When pregnant women went to the fields, Rusai always asked them to work on the inside, while she worked on the outside, fearing that the pregnant women would accidentally fall off the embankment (most of the fields here are terraced). Even if the women made mistakes, she didn't attack them. Last year, when weeding, group member Xiao Hua accidentally chopped down a golden queen corn seedling. Everyone said she was careless and had a bad attitude towards her, which made Xiao Hua's face turn pale. Rusai ran over and saw that she already knew she was wrong, so she said, "It's okay, the seedlings there are a bit dense." In private, she persuaded the group members again. After that, Xiao Hua's morale was high again, and she worked carefully.
    Secondly, she always endures hardship first and enjoys later. For example, when distributing cotton for spinning, she always lets others pick first. Last summer, when electing models, she divided the prize she received—money and needles—to everyone. The group members didn't want it, she said, "The model is for everyone. If it weren't for everyone working hard, how could we have become a model!"

　　阳城劳动妇女的旗帜
    白如赛妇女互助队
    太岳第四专署
    白如赛住的村子卢家河，是阳城六区岩山村的一个属村，全庄共有六十一户人家。由于干部帮助，积极分子带头，全庄上的一百四十个男女全半劳力已全部组织起来，白如赛的妇女互助组也成为阳城劳动妇女中的一面旗。兹将她们的几个主要特点介绍出来，以供参考。
    妇女互助困难多，男人来帮助
    这里妇女历来就没上地习惯，妇女只管家里的生活，纺织、做饭、看娃娃，就以一年一季的养蚕来说，也得男人把桑叶摘回来，妇女喂喂就算了事。去年二月生产委员卢思河同志到县里受训回来，认识到今年要闹翻身（群众运动）又要打仗，还要不误生产，那就非组织妇女不可，可是当他在冬学上把这问题提出时，却是困难重重，群众都没信心。男人们认为妇女是“家里人”，上地不算话，婆婆们怕媳妇上了地还得自己做饭、看娃娃，妇女们也觉得上地是难事，没力气，不会干，卢思河同志觉得光说话不顶事，咱先帮助积极分子看行不行。他觉着帮助白如赛最合适，因为：第一、白如赛正派稳重，不怕别人说闲话，又是妇会小组长，又最能团结妇女们。第二、他的家庭和睦、进步，男人是民兵，翁婆都很贤良。第三、他是个二十三岁的青年，没小孩、大脚，平常就肯劳动，他和白如赛一谈，如赛就满心愿意，“你从县里回来一说，我就愿意，就是看见大家都不愿意，我也没有敢张嘴”。思河同志就和白如赛商议，先动员家里能离开的青年妇女，参加互助组。最后思河告如赛说：“不要紧，你出头干，遇着啥困难和过不去的地方有我帮助你”。白如赛就一个一个去动员，共动员了五个人，但这些人也信心不大，“咱上地能干了啥？”思河同志告他们说：“地里生活并不难做，咱不会做巧活重活，咱不能先做些轻活粗活，咱先上地踩踩谷，看行不行”？于是男互助组在前边种，妇女们在后边踩，踩的很好，妇女们说：“这并不难呀！”种完谷了，接着就该锄麦，妇女们又怕锄不好，思河同志说：“好锄，我教你们。”五个妇女把五户的三十五·七亩麦地锄完了，情绪很高，他们又自动提出要帮助金科组锄三亩麦，赚了九升工资米，这一下全庄妇女们都说话了：“人家也是妇女，和咱不一样？怎叫把咱的小米赚走了！”接着就有三十一个青年妇女参加了互助组，分了三个小组，大家推选白如赛同志为队长，各互助组都推选一个有技术的男人，专门领导妇女上地做活，告他们说什么生活应该如何做，这样逐渐的使妇女们一般生活都学会了。
    家庭分红与同院变工
    一开始互助时，虽然就已规定了妇女上地也一样挣工资，但由于过去的传统习惯，妇女所得工资全部归男人所有，因之不几天就发生问题了。互助组开会时，妇女不去参加了，中年妇女不愿上地，说他们脚小、有娃娃，家里零星生活多走不开，后来卢思河、白如赛就召集会议和大家谈心，才知道妇女们的心里觉得劳动不劳动和咱没关系，挣下钱咱也见不了，花不上，这才觉得要叫妇女好好劳动，挣下的钱应该归妇女自己。但男人们又不愿意，说：“吃上家里的喝上家里的，赚下钱也是他们的，光他们有账算”。于是这才按双方意见，由双方商议，决定妇女挣下工资和家里四六分红（妇女得四）。这一来，妇女们都争着参加互助组。
    这一问题解决了，随之而来的另一个难问题是妇女们都想上地，家里的做饭、看娃娃等零活没人管，又把人难住了，而这一带有个特点是小家庭多，一般的是妇夫俩有些老小，很少有妯娌们伙在一起的。另外则是一个院，楼上楼下就住七、八家。以后才研究出一个际的妇女可以变工，只留一、二人在家做饭、看娃娃，其余的人上地，在家的人给别人做饭、看娃娃也根据情况挣上地人的工票。比如你给我做五个人的饭，我一天给你二分工票，这一来就可抽出大批妇女上地。
    “如赛真好呀！”
    卢家河的群众提起如赛来，异口同声的说：“如赛真好呀！”为什么他会这样的被群众拥护呢？
    首先是他处处关心妇女痛苦，时时体会他们的困难。他怕小孩吃上喘奶生病，便和大家研究，决定奶小孩的妇女中午不上地，怀胎妇女上地时，如赛总是叫他们靠地里边作活，她自己靠外边，怕孕妇不小心掉在堰下（这里多系梯田），即使妇女有了错误，她也不是打击她们，去年锄苗时，组员小花无意中把一棵金皇后玉茭苗铲了，大家都说她不小心，对她的态度也不好，弄得小花脸上一青一白很难受，如赛跑来一看，知道她已知错，便说：“不要紧，那里苗就有些稠”。暗地里她才又说服组员们。以后小花情绪又高，作活又细心。
    其次是：她处处都是吃苦在前，享受在后，比如纺织分花时，总是先让别人先挑。去年夏季选举模范时，她所得的奖品——钱针——都分给大家，组员们不要，她说：“模范是大家的，要不是大家好好劳动，咱那里能当了模范！”
