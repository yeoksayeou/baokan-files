　　Xingtai Eleventh District
    Model Demonstrations Promote Overall Planting of 1,500 Mu of Autumn Grain
    [Our Newspaper, Xingtai News] The Eleventh District's drought resistance situation report: On May 25th, after the cadres returned to the district from the county meeting, they went directly to the key villages (a total of five key villages in the district). First, they convened a meeting of cadres and activists to discuss drought resistance. At the meeting, they discovered ideas such as waiting for rain, calculating petty gains, fearing wage expenses, and thinking that planting during a drought was useless. After discussion, from the achievements of carrying water to plant cotton, they talked about the shortage of grain in famine years, that farmers rely on the land, that planting one plant is better than planting none, and that planting is better than not planting. They cleared the minds of several activists and then seized these activists, taking action themselves to lead the carrying of water for planting. Using these achievements and models, they cleared the minds of the masses and promoted the whole village. Wang Zhiyi of Dongchuankou, based on his achievements in planting cotton, understood and cleared the minds of others. The next day, he organized his mutual aid team to carry water for planting, planting 3.2 mu of millet and irrigating 1 mu of cotton in one day. In the evening, after a broadcast, the masses heard the achievements of this group, and the whole village took action, carrying water to irrigate cotton and planting more than 50 mu in one day. After breaking through one village, they convened a meeting of all key village cadres and activists, using practical examples to clear the minds of the activists in each village. The leadership also proposed drought resistance merit, and each village launched challenges. The enthusiasm for drought resistance quickly swept through each village. The Dongshan village chief set an example, working hard to carry water, carrying three more loads of water than others in half a day. Under his influence, he led five activists, all of whom exceeded the number they should have carried. After the broadcast in the evening, each group launched a competition, and the chairman of the Women's Rescue Association also carried water. In five days, they carried water to plant 138 mu, irrigated 149 mu of cotton, hoed 2,719.7 mu of cotton, carried water to plant 322 mu of peanuts, carried water to plant 1,146.8 mu of millet and sorghum, transformed 141 mu of water fields, dug 250 wells, dug 83 water ditches, and dug 320 pits.
