Socialism is Consolidating and Strengthening; Soviet Union Abolishes the Death Penalty

    Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Issues Decree Abolishing the Death Penalty

    (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd) TASS reports: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a decree on May 26 abolishing the death penalty. The full text is as follows:

    The Soviet people's historic victory over the enemy not only demonstrates the increasing power of the Soviet state, but also, and primarily, the Soviet people's boundless loyalty to the Soviet motherland and the Soviet government. At the same time, regardless of the aggressors' attempts to incite war, the international situation in this period after the surrender of Germany and Japan shows that the cause of peace can be guaranteed for a long time. In view of these circumstances, and in accordance with the wishes of the trade unions and other prestigious organizations representing various sectors of society, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR believes that there is no longer any need to impose the death penalty under peaceful conditions. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has decided: 1. To abolish the death penalty as stipulated in the current laws of the Soviet Union in peacetime. 2. Criminals who should be sentenced to death according to current laws will, in peacetime, be sentenced to imprisonment in labor re-education camps for a term of twenty-five years instead. 3. Those who have been sentenced to death but have not yet been executed before the promulgation of this decree shall have their sentences replaced by the criminal law stipulated in Article 2 of this decree, as determined by the Supreme Court.

    最高苏维埃主席团发布废除死刑法令
    【新华社陕北三日电】塔斯社讯：苏联最高苏维埃主席团于五月二十六日发表关于废除死刑的法令，全文如下：
    苏维埃人民击败敌人的历史的胜利，不仅表现了苏维埃国家日益增长的威力，而且首先是表现了苏联人民对于苏维埃祖国及苏维埃政府的无限忠诚。同时，不管侵略分子如何企图煽动战争，在德国和日本投降后的这一时期的国际情势，显示和平事业是可以长期保证的。鉴于这些情况，并为符合职工联盟与其他代表各界意见之有威望的组织的愿望，苏联最高苏维埃主席团认为，在和平条件下已没有判处死刑的必要。苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定：一、在和平时期废除苏联现行法所规定之死刑。二、按现行法应处死刑之罪犯，在和平时期代以为期二十五年之劳动感化院的监禁。三、已判处死刑，但在本法令公布前尚未执行者，由最高法院决定以本法令第二条所规定的刑法代替之。
