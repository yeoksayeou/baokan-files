　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Show No Sense of National Consciousness
    Digging Up and Destroying General Luo Binghui's Tomb
    [Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 23rd] The tomb of General Luo Binghui, the famous anti-Japanese general and former deputy commander of the New Fourth Army, who was renowned both at home and abroad, was竟遭 dug up and destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. According to Li Xia, a female political worker from the news department of Chiang Kai-shek's 74th Division who was liberated in Menglianggu, who spoke in detail about what she witnessed: Late last month, after Chiang Kai-shek's 83rd Division occupied Linyi, a team of Chiang Kai-shek's troops went to the side of the Anti-Japanese Martyrs Cemetery of the Eighth Route Army outside the east gate to dig up General Luo's coffin. Li Xia and others went to the site after hearing about it. General Luo's remains had already been thrown out of the coffin, his outer clothes were all stripped off, leaving only his shirt and shorts, his head was smashed, his shoes were taken off, and one of his thighs was tied high and hung on a locust tree. A large group of Chiang Kai-shek's troops were throwing stones at it, and General Luo's bones were covered with wounds. The next day, General Luo's body was secretly buried by the masses, but the destroyed coffin was still lying on the side of the road, and the tomb had become a pool of water. The entire military and civilians of the East China Liberated Area are filled with boundless hatred for Chiang Kai-shek's troops' barbarous atrocities, and vow to thoroughly wipe out all of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in order to comfort General Luo's heroic spirit. It is reported that General Luo Binghui fought for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people for decades. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led the brave soldiers of the Second Division of the New Fourth Army in a bitter battle against the Japanese puppets on both sides of the Huaihai-Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and established the Huainan base area, making great contributions. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, he died of illness in Lanling Town, Linyi, southern Shandong, due to overwork last June, and was buried in the suburbs of Linyi. The Chiang Kai-shek troops' occupation of Linyi and their adoption of barbaric methods are the best proof of Chiang Kai-shek and his reactionary clique's dead end.

　　蒋军无丝毫民族意识
    挖毁罗炳辉将军墓
    【新华社华东前线二十三日电】威震中外抗日名将新四军故副军长罗炳辉将军坟墓，竟遭蒋军挖毁。据孟良崮被解放的蒋军七十四师新闻处女政工人员李霞详谈其目击事实称：上月下旬，蒋军八十三师侵占临沂后，一队蒋军即前往东门外八路军抗日烈士纪念墓旁挖掘罗将军灵柩。李霞等闻讯前往该地，罗将军之遗体已被抛出棺外，外衣全被剥去，仅剩衬衣短裤，头部被击烂，鞋子被脱去，一条大腿被系高悬一槐树上，大群蒋军正以石块投掷，罗将军骸骨创痕斑斑。翌日，罗将军尸体即被群众偷偷掩埋，但毁裂之棺木仍倒于道旁，墓穴则成一水潭。华东解放区全体军民对蒋军如此野蛮暴行，益增无限仇恨，誓彻底歼灭全部蒋军，以慰罗将军英灵。按罗炳辉将军为中国人民解放事业奋斗数十年，抗战期间率领新四军第二师健儿与日伪苦战于淮海津浦铁路两侧，创建了淮南根据地，功勋卓著。抗战胜利后，因积劳成病，于去年六月病逝鲁南临沂兰陵镇，葬于临沂城郊。蒋军攻占临沂后，采取野蛮手段，正是蒋介石及其反动集团穷途末路的最好证明。
