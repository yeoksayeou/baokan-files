　　From historical, economic, political, and ideological perspectives
    Purging "Transformed" Landlords in Jin-Sui Region
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 27th] Land reform work teams in various parts of the Jin-Sui region are mobilizing peasants to re-examine the class composition of rural areas and to purge "transformed" landlords. It has now been discovered that the previously determined class composition in various places was generally incorrect. Many landlords and bankrupt landlords were classified as rich peasants, middle peasants, or even poor peasants. They usurped political power and peasant associations, even usurping the Party, and preserved large amounts of good land and property. This is an important reason why villages that were thought to have thoroughly completed land reform last year were, in fact, not thorough. For example, in Dongxiuzhuang, Wuzhai, which was hailed as a "model village," only one landlord household was registered in the past, but now it has been found that there are actually nineteen landlord households. Of the nineteen village cadres, landlords accounted for nine. Events also occurred everywhere in which many landlords who had been overthrown were treated as middle peasants and had the fruits of the struggle returned to them when correcting the mistakes of infringing upon the interests of middle peasants. Research shows that the transformation of landlords began as early as the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, shrinking production, selling poor land to preserve good land, feigning labor, and even pretending to be "enlightened." The reasons for the misclassification of landlords are mainly that the cadres have low political awareness, are not familiar with the history of the village, and are deceived by the false appearances of the landlords. They only look at the present situation and not at history, only look at the surface and not at the essence, and are self-righteous without following the mass line. Now, the poor peasants have bravely risen up to thoroughly examine the class composition of landlords from historical, economic, political, and ideological perspectives, and a large number of "transformed" landlords are being exposed.

　　从历史、经济、政治、思想着眼
    晋绥清查“化形”地主
    【新华社晋绥廿七日电】晋绥各地土地改革工作团正发动农民，重新审查农村阶级成份，清查“化形”地主。现已发现各地过去所订阶级成份普遍发生错误，地主和破产地主很多被订成富农、中农甚至贫农，篡夺政权和农会，甚至篡夺党，保存大量好地和财物。这是去年曾被认为土地改革已经彻底的村庄，而实则并不彻底的重要原因。如号称“模范村”的五寨东秀庄，过去登记地主只一户，现查明实有地主十九户。全村干部十九人，地主即占九人。当纠正侵犯中农利益的错误时，许多已被斗倒的地主又被当作中农而退还斗争果实的事件，也到处发生。经研究地主化形从抗战之初即已开始，缩小生产，卖破地保存好地，伪装劳动，甚至假装“开明”。产生错订地主成份的原因，主要是干部的政治警觉性低，且不熟悉本村历史，被地主的假象所迷惑。只看现状不问历史，只看表面不看本质，自以为是而不走群众路线。现在各地贫苦农民已勇敢起来从历史上、经济上、政治上、思想上彻底审查地主成份，大批“化形”地主原形毕露。
