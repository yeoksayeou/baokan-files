Yan Xishan's Old Nest in Western Shanxi Overturned
    Ke Ren
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 7th] Yan's stubborn troops, entrenched in Xiangning City, attempted to build this city into an impregnable fortress under the policy of "anti-communism" and anti-people. In the narrow mountainous area around the city, there were seven complete defense lines (North Mountain, Hot Spring, Nuanquan, Dragon King Slope, West Slope, Liujiayuan, and Jijiayuan). The largest defense line was two *li* long, and each defense line was equipped with two to five interlocking fortifications. There were 162 bunkers around the city, divided into platoon bunkers, two- to four-story bunkers, and low-profile bunkers, as well as earth bunkers, hidden bunkers, field fortifications, cut slopes, outer trenches, broken stone walls, and earth walls. They boasted that each defense line could operate independently and support each other. But they did not expect that when the charge of the People's Liberation Army sounded, they would all be involuntarily controlled. The People's Liberation Army began a pincer attack on the north and south mountains of Xiangning on the afternoon of the 22nd, and the Jijiayuan defense line, after half an hour of artillery bombardment, the enemy was already softened up in the fortifications. One company surrendered, and after continuous attacks on the North Mountain defense line, the first five-zhang-high cut slope was captured at 12 o'clock. At this time, the enemy on the entire front lost the determination to hold on, and fled in panic from various defense lines to the hot spring, attempting a final struggle. Zhao Sangua and his two team members quickly sneaked into the fortifications on Nange in the dark night, catching the enemies in the pillbox by surprise. They had no choice but to respectfully lay down their weapons. When I broke into the hot spring defense line, the enemy stirred. The commander of the 204th Regiment attempted to ease this situation at the cost of a company. The next day, under the cover of two aircraft, a fierce battle broke out. The leading enemies approached our army's fortifications, and Zhang Jiasheng threw them back with a grenade. The enemy charged a second time, and his machine gun bullets poured over, and many enemies fell. Each defense line quickly deployed firepower, and the enemies had just dodged the shells in front when the shells behind exploded again. Smoke and dust billowed from all directions, and they could no longer care about the charge, and the remaining dozens of remnants hid in the fortifications with their heads in their hands.
    At dusk, the general attack began, and the artillery accurately destroyed the frontline bunkers on the northeast highlands, and the infantry began to move towards the enemy. In an instant, a three-sided attack began. The enemy's two-*li*-long hot spring defense line was stirred and trapped in the heavy siege of artillery fire.
    The attack in the northeast direction began in the midst of thunder and rain, and the soldiers advanced through the mud. Wang Xingui and Lang Xinhui pulled out the deer fences on the earthen slope in the enemy's dense fire, and then stuffed two grenades into the bunker from the exit collapsed by the artillery fire, and immediately occupied the bunker. Then the ladder leaned against the cut slope, and the soldiers climbed up one after another. Although Lang Xinhui was seriously injured while climbing the ladder, he lay on the ground without saying a word. Many soldiers wanted to help him down, but he said, "It doesn't matter, hurry up, don't let the enemy counterattack!" Li Qingyun was the first to step onto the ground, and ran to where he heard gunfire, and the enemies in the first defense line were wiped out, and he ran to the second defense line, and he captured seven prisoners alone. The prisoners sent from various places had also crowded the bunkers. There were no enemies on the field fortifications. Two red signal flares had risen into the sky. The enemies in the uppermost fortifications saw that the fortifications below were occupied, and launched five counterattacks in two directions, but all failed. The exasperated commander took his anger out on the soldiers, and two squad leaders and several remnants were shot dead as soon as they retreated. The attacking troops of Jia Rongpo suddenly raided the enemy's first defense line at 3:00 a.m., and the troops of Shi Mo also took the opportunity to attack the gourd-shaped defense line. The hot spring defense line was shrouded in thick smoke. The enemies, who could not take care of each other from beginning to end, came to the conclusion at this time: Believing in strong fortifications had suffered a miserable defeat. The enemy regimental commander, commissioner, county magistrate, etc., had just fled out of the defense line and became prisoners by leading by example. Finally, more than 2,000 enemies on the mountain surrendered their guns submissively.

　　阎锡山晋西老巢被打翻了
    克仁
    【本报太岳七日电】盘据在乡宁城的阎顽军在“反共”反人民政策下，妄图把这座城布置成坚不可破的阵地。城周的狭小山区里，即有七个完整的阵地（北山、温泉、暖泉、龙王坡、西坡、刘家原、冀家原）。最大的阵地长达二里，每个阵地设两个至五个连环工事。城周有碉堡一百六十二个。内分排堡、两层至四层堡、低型碉，并有土碉、暗碉、野战工事、劈坡、外壕、断腰石墙、土墙等浩大工程。他们曾吹嘘各阵地均能独立作战，互相支援。但没料到当人民解放军进攻的号声响起时，他们却一起都身不由主了。人民解放军于二十二号下午开始以钳形夹击乡宁南北山地，冀家原阵地，经过半小时的弹火轰击，敌人已经软持在工事里。一个连束手就擒，北山阵地经过连续攻击，十二时已攻上第一道五丈多高的劈坡。此时全线敌人便丧失了固守决心，慌慌张张由各个阵地逃向温泉之中，企图作最后挣扎。赵三瓜和他的两个组员飞快的在漆黑的夜里摸进南阁上的工事，使炮楼里的敌人遇了个措手不及。只好恭敬的放下武器。当我打入温泉阵地时，敌人骚动起来。二○四团团长企图用一个连的代价缓和这种空气。第二天在两架飞机掩护下展开激烈的争夺战。先头的敌人接近了我军工事，张家胜一颗手榴弹便把他们炸了回去。敌人二次冲上来，他的机枪弹倾泻过去，许多敌人倒了下去。各个阵地很快展开火力，敌人刚躲开前面的炮弹，后面的炮弹又爆炸了。四面八方烟尘滚滚，他们再也顾不上冲锋，剩下的几十个残兵抱头躲进了工事里。
    黄昏，总攻击开始，炮兵准确的摧毁了东北高地前线碉堡，步兵开始向敌方运动。一瞬间三面夹击开始了。敌人那条二里长的温泉阵地激荡的陷在炮火的重围里。
    东北方向在雷雨交加中开始攻击，战士踏着泥泞前进，王新贵、朗新惠在敌人密集的火网里拔掉了土坡的鹿砦，又从炮弹轰塌的出口向地堡里塞进两颗手榴弹，立即占领了地堡。接着梯子靠上了劈坡，战士们一个接一个的爬上去。朗心惠虽然在上梯子时负了重伤，但他一声不响躺在地上。许多战士要扶他下去，他却说：“不要紧，大家赶快，不要叫敌人反扑过来！”李庆云第一个踏上大地，听到那里枪响就跑向那里，第一个阵地的敌人消灭了，又跑向第二个阵地，他一个人一连捉住了七个俘虏。从各地送来的俘虏也已把碉堡挤满了。野战工事上没有了敌人。两颗红色信号弹已升在天空。最上一层工事里的敌人看见下面工事被占领了，分两路向我反扑五次，都失败了。恼羞成怒的指挥官却拿战士们出气，两个班长和几个残兵刚退回去就被打死了。贾容坡的攻击部队于夜三时突然袭入敌人的首头阵地，石磨的部队亦乘机攻入葫芦形的阵地。温泉阵地已笼罩在弥漫的烟雾里。首尾不能相顾的敌人，此时才做下了结论：迷信坚强的工事都遭了惨败。敌团长专员县长等，刚逃跑出阵地，以身先士卒的当了俘虏。最后在山头上有两千多个敌人驯服的缴出了他们的枪。
