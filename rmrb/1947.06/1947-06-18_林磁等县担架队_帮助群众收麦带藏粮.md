　　Linci and Other County Stretcher Teams
    Help the Masses Harvest Wheat and Conceal Grain
    [This newspaper reports] The movement of stretcher teams from Lin, Ci, Lu, Hui, and Tangyin counties on the northern Henan front, together with various supply stations, to help the masses rush to harvest is reaching its climax. With everyone's confidence in ensuring that not a single mu of wheat is lost, they are helping the masses with both harvesting and concealment. According to statistics, they have already helped conceal 2,638 mu of wheat. In this movement, each county has demonstrated its exemplary behavior. The Lin county militia put forward three guarantees: fast harvesting, low stubble, and clean wheat rows. The Hui county stretcher team arrived at the front line on the first day, and the next day, despite their fatigue, they got up early to help with the rush harvest. The Tangyin supply station cadres took the lead and all participated in the rush harvest, proposing practical work, cherishing agricultural tools, and combining propaganda. Ci county used the method of constantly praising models to excite everyone, and generally, everyone worked harder than they would on their own land.

    【本报讯】豫北前线林、磁、潞、辉、汤阴等县担架队与各兵站帮助群众抢收的运动已进入高潮。在大家保证不丢一亩麦子的信心下，帮助群众连收割带埋藏，现统计已帮助收藏了二千六百三十八亩麦子。在这一运动中各县都表现了自己的模范行为。林县民兵提出三大保证：割的快、麦茬低、麦垅净；辉县担架头天赶到前线，第二天不顾疲劳起早就帮助抢收；汤阴兵站干部带头，全体参加了抢收，并提出踏实干、爱惜农具、结合宣传等；磁县用不断表模的办法兴奋了大家，一般都比做自己的地还出力。
