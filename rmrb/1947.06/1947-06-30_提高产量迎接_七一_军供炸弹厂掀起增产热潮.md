　　Raising Production to Welcome “July 1st”
　　Military Supply Bomb Factory Launches Production Increase Campaign
　　[This newspaper’s dispatch] Since the military supply bomb factory began its meritorious service campaign, the factory's output has continuously increased. The output in May exceeded March by more than one and a half times. The main focus of June is to consolidate production achievements and ensure they do not decline. On the 15th of this month, Foreman Li summarized the work of the first half of the month and proposed: "In order to welcome the Chinese Communist Party's birthday, 'July 1st,' let's all work harder and increase the production quantity in June another step." All the workers in the factory enthusiastically took action. They went to work as soon as they finished eating in the morning. Even after lunch was served, the old female worker Wang Xingcheng in the assembly shop was still stringing ropes, and the two young apprentices, Jia Junxian and Wang Yongle, were still continuously filling the handles by the stove. Everyone worked hard, and no one took a nap. The time clock ringing for the end of work seemed to have nothing to do with the workers, who continued working without stopping.

　　[This newspaper's Jinan, Hebei, 28th dispatch] Workers in public factories in southern Hebei are stepping up their work to welcome the Communist Party's birthday, "July 1st," striving to improve quality and quantity, practicing thrift, and actively supporting the front lines. In addition to completing ×× sets of single-layer clothing, ×× hats, and ×× quilts ahead of schedule, the military region's clothing factory is now doing odd jobs and subscribing to six newspapers to intensify their studies. The type casting group of the Hebei Jinan Bookstore originally planned to cast 5,000 characters per day, but last month they cast 16,000 characters in one day, exceeding the target by more than three times. All workers also automatically stipulated that they would work 11 hours a day, with some working without a lunch break. Since the May 1st Commemoration Conference, every worker in the Xingzhong Printing Factory has automatically made plans. Director Gao automatically offered to work 48 Sundays of voluntary work each year and support the front lines with 10 kilograms of millet per month until Chiang Kai-shek is defeated. Under his influence, the entire factory automatically increased work by one hour per day and saved 310 kilograms of rice and 6,000 yuan per month to support the front lines. The Lihua Department Store and Shoe and Hat Store, directly led by the Linqing City Federation of Trade Unions, took the lead in responding to the General Federation's call for thrift, reduced the standard of living, and changed the past practice of eating white flour, drinking alcohol, and having four dishes to two meals of millet cornbread a day, completely eliminating alcohol. Under the influence of their exemplary actions, the city's workers are reducing their living standards and saving to support the front lines.

　　提高产量迎接“七一” 
   军供炸弹厂掀起增产热潮
    【本报讯】军供炸弹厂自立功运动以来，全厂产量不断提高，五月份比三月份超过一倍半还要多，六月份主要是巩固生产成绩保证不往下降。本月十五号李工长总结了上半月工作后，提出：“为了迎接中国共产党的生日‘七一’，大家再加点油把六月份生产数量再提高一步。”全场工友都热烈的行动起来。天一亮吃了饭就上工，已开了午饭，装配班房里的老女工王兴成还在串绳，两个小学徒贾俊先、王永乐还在火炉边不停的灌把子，大家紧张工作，谁也不睡午觉。记工员打的下工钟好像与工人完全没有关系似的，还是不停的工作。

    【本报冀南二十八日电】冀南各公营工厂工人为迎接共产党的生日“七一”，纷纷加紧工作，努力提高质量数量，并历行节约，积极支援前线。军区被服厂除提前完成××套单衣，××顶帽子，××条被子外，现一面作零活，一面自动订了六份报，加紧学习。冀南书店铸字组原定每天铸字五千字，上月一天就铸了一万六千字，超过三倍以上，全体工人并自动规定每天工作十一小时，有的不歇晌还在作工。行中印刷厂自五一纪念大会后，每个工人都自动订计划，高主任自动作每年四十八个星期日的义务工，并每月支援前线小米十斤，直到打败蒋介石为止，全厂在他影响下一律自动每天加工一小时，并每月节约米三百一十斤，钱六千元，支援前线。临清市职工会直接领导的利华百货商店及鞋帽店，首先响应总会节约号召，降低生活水平，把过去吃白面、喝酒、四个菜的作风改为每天两顿小米窝窝头，酒完全取消了。在他们模范行动影响下，全市职工正降低水平和节约支援前线。
