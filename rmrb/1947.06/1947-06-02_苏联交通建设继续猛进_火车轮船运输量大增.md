　　Soviet Transportation Construction Continues to Surge Forward
    Train and Ship Transport Volume Greatly Increases
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th] Comprehensive report: To adapt to the enormous needs of advancing the second year of the post-war Five-Year Plan, the construction of Soviet transportation has also seen rapid development in April and May: (1) Railways and various transportation machinery: The production of locomotives and freight cars in April this year increased more than two and a half times compared to April last year. There are now more than one hundred newly designed machines and tools to help quickly complete railway construction plans. The work on restoring the second track on the Moscow-Kharkov-Rostov double-track railway (over 2,400 li in length, a major artery connecting the national center with the Donets Basin and the Caucasus) in the Five-Year Plan has been completed and is open to traffic. The daily train load in the Soviet Union has rapidly increased to 33 million ton-kilometers. This year, one thousand railway stations will be equipped with newly designed automatic electric signals, which can prevent any derailment incidents at stations. The production of cranes and elevators will exceed the plan by 30 percent this year. The Moscow Road Machinery Manufacturing Plant has produced a huge transporter with a daily transport volume of 2,000 tons, which can replace dozens of ordinary transporters. This year, 120 such transporters will begin operation. (2) Shipping: The Baltic Sea, Black Sea, North Sea, Caspian Sea, and Sea of Azov have all begun summer navigation, with regular mail ships carrying out cargo and passenger transport. The heroic city of Odessa's first port on the Black Sea has been restored, and ship construction is being intensified. The serious wounds of the port of Leningrad have also healed and will connect with the world. Pillau on the Baltic coast of East Prussia has been renamed the city of "Baltiysk." This prosperous new Soviet port is rising from the ruins. The Soviet Merchant Marine Research Institute is currently carrying out the construction of new-style docks and huge floating breakwaters. According to the Director of the Soviet Shipping Bureau: This year, inland river shipping volume will increase by 25.5 percent compared to last year, an unprecedented surge; inland river docks and shipyards will increase by 40 percent. (3) Aviation: The main civil aviation trunk lines from Moscow to the capitals of various republics and important centers in various regions will be completed this summer. Hundreds of local routes will also be created, and international routes from Moscow to the capitals of Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the Mongolian People's Republic will also be opened. (4) Telecommunications: All major cities in the Soviet Union have begun to build fifty large-scale automatic telephone exchanges, eighteen of which will begin operation this summer. The fourth most modern radio photo transmission station built by the Soviet Union after the war is being built in Smirovsk (southern Urals).
