　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Comprehensive reports indicate that the parliamentary sham election held in Lebanon on May 25th has been met with protests and criticisms from people and public opinion across the country. Consequently, a second election had to be held on June 1st. According to official statistics, the second election in the highland and southern districts still saw only about 50% of voters participating, while other electoral districts did not hold a second election. Furthermore, according to Beirut's "Saint Ahi Shalab" newspaper, the majority of voters boycotted the second election, with voter turnout generally not exceeding 10%. Widespread vote-buying occurred in many areas, and in some areas, police even forced residents to vote. Therefore, a press conference held in Beirut sent a letter to the Lebanese President, demanding the immediate dissolution of the parliament forced upon the people through terror and forged public opinion, and demanding free elections. They declared their opposition to the current parliament, refusing to participate in its meetings or publish any news about it.

　　黎巴嫩人民继续反对伪选
    要求解散伪议会
    【新华社陕北十二日电】综合报导：黎巴嫩自五月二十五日举行议会伪选后，遭受全国人民及舆论与抗议和抨击，不得不于六月一日举行第二次选举。据官方的统计，第二次选举的结果，高原地和南部的选举区，仍然只有约百分之五十的选民参加投票，而其他选举区则未举行第二次选举。另据贝鲁特的“圣亚希·莎拉伯”报称：大多数选民均抵制第二次选举，投票的选民比例一般的不超过百分之十。许多地区公开贿买选票，某些地区警察竟强迫居民投票。因此，在贝鲁特召开的新闻记者会议致函黎巴嫩总统，要求立即解散以恐怖和伪造民意的手段强迫人民选出的议会，并要求举行自由选举。他们宣称抵现议会，不参加议会的会议，不刊登议会的任何消息。
