　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. Comprehensive report: The Soviet Council of Ministers has recently passed a resolution on awarding the Stalin Prizes for outstanding inventions and major improvements in science, art, and literature, and production methods for 1946. The Stalin Prize was established by the Soviet government in 1939 to celebrate Stalin's sixtieth birthday. The first awards were given in 1941, and this is the sixth time. The total prize money is 13,150,000 rubles, and there are 157 winners, including people of different ages, nationalities, and professions, ranging from 20-year-old youths to 84-year-old elders. Eight people won first-class science prizes, including physics, technology, chemistry, biology, physiology, law, history, and linguistics, each receiving more than 20,000 rubles. Seven people won first-class prizes for civilization and improvement of production methods, including socialist labor heroes, geologists, architects, breeders, and engineers, each receiving 150,000 rubles. Twenty-five people won first-class art and literature prizes, including composers, pianists, sculptors, actors, filmmakers, and playwrights, each receiving 100,000 rubles. (Note: The exchange rate between the ruble and the US dollar in 1945 was five to one.)
　　The awarding of science and production prizes summarizes the achievements of the Soviet people; they are working hard to complete the most important task of the post-war five-year plan, which is to catch up with and surpass the achievements of foreign science in the near future. In 1946 alone, artists created dozens of plays, musical works, paintings, and sculptures of various types, depicting the best characteristics of the Soviet people. For example, composer Shebalin's "Moscow" is a valuable piece of music that tells people about Moscow's glorious past and the heroic defense of Moscow in this war. Many of the winning writers are new writers who were unknown before the war, such as the young writer Viktor Nekrasov, who won a second-class prize for his debut work "In the Trenches of Stalingrad." But Simonov has won the award for the fourth time.

　　Reactionary Forces Use Science to Harm Humanity
　　Socialist Science Improves People's Lives
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th. TASS News: Moscow newspapers recently published editorials on the awarding of the 1946 Stalin Prizes. Pravda stated: The awarding of the Stalin Prizes is a true festival for Soviet science and art, a major event in the country's social activities and political life, and a nationwide review of talent and scientific and artistic achievements. Moreover, it has become a proof of the cultural strength of socialist society. In the current situation, reactionary forces in capitalism are trying to use science to harm humanity and transform it into a tool for imperialist aggression. In a victorious socialist country where the people are in power, science has become a great tool for developing the productive forces of Soviet society, strengthening the Soviet state, and ensuring the development of the national and cultural living standards of the working people.

　　Reactionary Forces Hinder Scientific Progress and Development
　　Socialism Inspires Great Creativity
　　The News reported: In the major capitalist countries, deep anxiety forces progressive scientists to conceal their research, because their achievements are plundered by a few monopolistic capitalists and militarists who seek to suppress the growing mass consciousness and condone new wars. The content of art and literature is all about the decline of individuality and escape from real life. The Soviet system has produced new Soviet intellectuals who come from the people and faithfully serve the people. For the first time, science has taken a broad step towards creative freedom, unrestricted by the self-interest of capitalist groups. In the Soviet Union, science has become an object of constant state care, and the state guarantees the material conditions for scientific activities. The Soviet system provides unlimited opportunities for the further development and completion of new art and our actors, singers, and dancers. The development of new talents among the people powerfully demonstrates the great creativity inspired by socialists.

　　检阅社会主义文化力量
    苏颁发斯大林奖金
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合报导：苏联部长会议顷通过关于颁发一九四六年科学、艺术与文学及生产方法上卓越发明及重要改进的斯大林奖金之决议。斯大林奖金为苏联政府在一九三九年创立，以庆祝斯大林六十寿辰。第一次颁奖系在一九四一年，此次是第六次，奖金总额为一千三百一十五万卢布，得奖者共一五七人，包括不同年龄各民族及各职业的人，有二十岁的青年，也有八十四岁的老人。荣获一等科学奖金者八人，包括物理、工艺、化学、生物、生理、法律、历史与语言等科学，每人得奖二十多卢布。荣获一等生产方法之文明及改进奖金者七人，包括社会主义劳动英雄、地质学家、设筑家、选种学家及工程师，每人得奖金十五万卢布。荣获一等艺术及文学奖金者二十五人，包括作曲家、钢琴家、雕刻家、演员、电影工作者及戏剧家等，每人得奖十万卢布。（按：一九四五年卢布与美金比价为五比一。）
    科学与生产奖金的颁发，总结着苏联人民的成就；他们努力完成战后五年计划中最重要的一种工作，即在近期内赶上外国科学之成就并超过之。艺术家们在一九四六年一年中创作了数十种各种类型的戏剧、乐曲、绘画与雕刻，描绘出苏联人民最美好的特点。如作曲家谢巴林所作的“莫斯科”就是一个有价值的曲子，它告诉人们莫斯科辉煌的过去，及这次战争中英雄的莫斯科保卫战。得奖的作家多为战前未闻名的新作家，如青年作家维克脱·尼可拉梭夫即以其处女作“在斯大林格勒战壕中”而获得二等奖金。但如西蒙诺夫则已是第四次得奖了。
    反动力量利用科学残害人类
    社会主义科学提高人民生活
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社讯：莫斯科各报顷就颁发一九四六年斯大林奖金一事发表社论。真理报称：斯大林奖金之颁授，为苏联科学与艺术之真正节日，为国家社会活动及政治生活中之重大事件，是对人材及科学与艺术成就的全国范围的检阅。而且，也已经成为社会主义社会文化力量的证明。在当前的情况下，资本主义反动力量正力图利用科学来残害人类，并改变为帝国主义侵略的工具。在人民自身当权的胜利的社会主义国家中，科学已经成为发展苏维埃社会生产力，强固苏维埃国家，及保证劳动人民之民族与文化生活水平发展的巨大工具。
    反动力量阻碍科学进步发展
    社会主义激发伟大的创造力
    消息报称：在各个主要的资本主义国家当中，深重的忧虑迫使着进步的科学家们隐瞒他们的研究，因为他们的成果为少数力图压迫日益生长的群众觉悟，并纵容新战争的独占资本家与军国主义者所劫掠。艺术与文学的内容则皆为个性的衰颓与真实生活的逃避。而苏维埃制度已产生了新的苏维埃知识分子，他们来自人民而又忠实的服务人民。科学已经首次不受资本家集团私利之限制而迈开创造自由之阔步。在苏联，科学已成为国家经常照顾的对象，国家保证了科学活动的物质条件。苏维埃制度，为新艺术以及我们演员、歌唱家、舞蹈家进一步发展与完成提供着无限的机会。人民中间新才能的发展，强有力地证明着为社会主义们激发的伟大的创造力。
