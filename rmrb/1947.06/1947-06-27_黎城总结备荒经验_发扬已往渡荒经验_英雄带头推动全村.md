　　【This Newspaper, Licheng News】 Licheng has achieved the following experiences in carrying out the savings and famine preparedness movement:
    I. By organizing the masses to recall the 1943 famine relief experience, overcome complacency, and organize the masses in thought and action to participate in the savings and famine preparedness movement. At the beginning, some of the masses were complacent about the drought, thinking, "If you see the seedlings, you will get a 30% harvest, and we have caught the seedlings here!" "If there is no rain in May, it will be terrible." Some even blindly believed: "Anyway, the government will not let anyone starve to death." All localities universally organized the masses to discuss: "What kind of restrictions did we suffer in the famine years?" During the discussion, the masses were reminded of the pain of famine and shed tears. Wang Qiao of Houzhuang recalled that his family of seven had to live on one pound of flour for two days in the famine year and cried so hard that he could not continue. The leadership then asked everyone to discuss the second question: "What did we rely on to survive the famine?" At this time, the masses immediately thought that it was thanks to the good production and savings. Some villages also combined this with calculating their family assets. For example, Labor Hero Wang Jucai led Shancangou to calculate that there were 206 people in the village, but only 169.4 dou (large dou) of coarse grains, 82.4 dou of bran, and 824 jin of dried vegetables were stored. There was little wheat in the summer, and the stored grain was not enough for half a year. This not only overcame the complacency of the masses, but more importantly, it promoted everyone's active courage and confidence in surviving the famine.
    II. Starting from calculations, heroes take the lead in promoting the whole village. Labor Hero Wang Tonghui first formulated a detailed production and savings plan at his family meeting and then quickly promoted it to the whole village. Houzhuang Spinning Hero Wang Qiao first got up early and worked late to spin an extra tael of cotton every day, and each person saved an average of two and a half li of rice per day, mixed bran with vegetables to eat. Later, it was promoted from the group to the whole village, and a plan was made to increase spinning by 96 jin of thread and save 1,468 jin of rice per month.
    III. Famine preparedness should not only save but also actively organize more production. The universal characteristic of the county's savings and famine preparedness movement is the close combination of expanding production and practical savings. Women in various places have proposed: "Spinning and weaving to increase production to survive the famine." The men of Guizishi proposed to squeeze out four more people to cut mountain goods, and to increase the value of mountain goods by 100,000 yuan in 20 days. Wangjiazhuang squeezed out labor from famine preparedness and planting to cut mountain goods, earning 374,000 yuan. Wang Shengguang's group in Caozhuang not only solved the problem of pocket money and ensured that they would not sell grain in sideline production, but also earned money to buy some grain to store for famine preparedness.

　　黎城总结备荒经验
    发扬已往渡荒经验
    英雄带头推动全村
    【本报黎城讯】黎城开展节约备荒运动取得如下经验：
    一、从组织群众回忆四三年渡荒经验中，克服麻痹情绪，在思想上行动上将群众组织起来卷入节约备荒运动。一开始部分群众存在着对旱灾的麻痹情绪，觉得“见苗三分收哩，咱这里捉住苗儿啦！”“五月里再没有雨，可就厉害啦。”甚至有的盲目的认为：“反正政府不叫饿死一个人”，各地普遍组织群众讨论：“灾荒年咱受过些啥制？”讨论中群众想起渡荒痛苦而下眼泪，后庄王巧想起灾荒年全家七口人借了一斤面过了两天时，哭的不能再说下去，领导上又让大家讨论第二个问题：“咱们靠啥渡过了灾荒？”这时群众一下子就想到多亏了生产节约搞的好，有些村又结合了算家当，比如劳英王聚才领导山仓沟计算全村二百零六口人，但只存粗粮一百六十九石四斗（大斗），糠八十二石四斗，干菜八百二十四斤，夏天麦子无几，存粮不够半年用，这样子不仅克服了群众麻痹情绪，更重要的是发扬了大家积极的渡荒勇气与信心。
    二、从计算出发，英雄带头推广全村。劳英王同会先由自己家庭会上详细订出生产节约的计划以后，很快就推广到全村。后庄纺英王巧先每日起早搭黑多纺一两花，每人每日平均节约两半米，掺糠吃菜，以后才由组推广到全村，订出一个月增纺九十六斤线，节省一千四百六十八斤米的计划。
    三、备荒不仅要进行节约更积极的是组织多生产，全县节约备荒运动开展的普遍特点是扩大生产与切实节约的紧密结合。各地妇女均提出：“纺织增产渡荒”。规子石男人提出多挤四个人去砍山货，二十天增砍山货值洋十万元。王家庄从备荒下种中挤出劳力砍山货，赚洋三十七万四千元。曹庄王生光组搞副业生产中，不仅解决零花保证不卖粮食，而且赚下钱要买些粮食存起来备荒。
