Hebei Central Literary Association Symposium
Literature and Art Serve the War and Land Reform

　　At the Hebei Central Literary Symposium on May 24th, Comrade Zhou Yang called on local literary and art workers to participate in the land reform movement. He said: "Land reform is inseparable from the self-defense war, and reflecting land reform also serves the self-defense war." Comrade Wang Yan of the Political Department introduced the findings of their investigation, including soldiers' requests for literary and art workers and their preferences and criticisms of artistic forms and content. He said: "On the one hand, soldiers urgently request that our literary and art workers absorb their new heroism and express it in various art forms. On the other hand, they hope that we can offer them artistic works to comfort and encourage them." Comrade Zhou Yang reiterated: "Today, the integration of literary and artistic creators with the thoughts and feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers is still our fundamental issue." When discussing the mass line in creation, he also said: "This is to use the language of the masses and the forms they love to reflect the opinions and emotions of ninety percent of the masses." Regarding how to grasp policies in creation, he said: "Literary and art workers must study policies. Without understanding policies, they cannot represent the masses in the liberated areas. However, grasping policies does not start from the articles but from showing how the masses act, practice, and create in the implementation of policies." Regarding the working methods for joining the army and going to the countryside, he said that work should be done first, then writing, and finally, he called on professional literary and art workers to cultivate new worker-peasant-soldier writers by adopting the methods of taking apprentices and making friends.

　　冀中文协座谈
    文艺为战争及土改服务
    周扬同志在五月廿四日冀中文艺座谈会上，号召地方文艺工作者参加到土地改革运动中去。他说：“土地改革与自卫战争分不开，反映土改也就是为自卫战争服务。”政治部王炎同志介绍经他们调查结果，战士对文艺工作者的要求和对艺术形式内容的喜爱与批评。他说：“战士对我们文艺工作者一方面是迫切要求我们吸收他们的新英雄主义，用各种艺术形态表现出来，另方面希望我们能献给他们艺术成品，来给他们以安慰和鼓励。”周扬同志复谓：“今天文艺创作者与工农兵思想情感相结合，仍是我们根本问题。”谈及创作上的群众路线时，他又说：“这就是用群众的语言与他们喜爱的形式，来反映百分之九十群众的意见和情绪。”关于创作如何掌握政策，他说：“文艺工作者必须学习政策，不懂政策，就不能表现解放区的群众。但掌握政策不是从条文出发，而是表现政策在贯彻中，群众如何行动起来，如何实践与创造。”关于入伍下乡的工作方法，他说应该首先作工作，然后才是写作，最后并号召专业文艺工作者用拉徒弟交朋友的方法培养工农兵新作家。
