　　[This newspaper Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, 15th dispatch] The re-examination in Hebei, Shandong and Henan provinces is vigorously unfolding. After the Nanle County convened a farmers' meeting in mid-May, all villages have been mobilized. In particular, the backward villages in the Third District, such as Xiaojiangdong, Xihan, and Sengu, have also taken action with the strong support of the leadership. The things found are even more than during the initial investigation. In the landlord Li Bensu's house in Xiaojiang Village alone, 127 large jars filled with wheat, sesame, mung beans, etc., buried underground were found, as well as 140 strings of copper coins. Many farmers also reported the items stored by the landlords. During the re-examination, the masses in various villages launched a house-swapping movement. 108 peasant families in Hanzhang swapped houses. In the initial investigation, the masses recognized the essence of the landlords and expressed their determination to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the landlords, without missing a single one. The landlords were centrally controlled and their actions were strictly monitored. A certain sub-district established a liberation committee, and labor hero Wang Zijian was elected as the director. He went to Xihan and Sengu to help with the work. The cadres and the masses all said it was "thorough," but the poor peasants were not enthusiastic. Old Wang then chatted with the cadres, calculating the landlords' wealth. As a result, it was found that none of the three landlords had been thoroughly struggled against. The cadres thought they were middle peasants. After Old Wang's repeated enlightenment and planning, the cadres' thinking was straightened out, and a poor peasants' meeting was convened, and the struggle began again. The landlord of Xiongmazhuang sold tofu after the land reform, but during the re-examination, 94 silver dollars were found in his wall. The Fourth District arrested 450 bad landlord bullies, and then the entire district convened a farmers' meeting of 5,000 people, and the situation in various villages was opened up vigorously. In the past, in Litai Village, the fruits of the land reform were used to forcibly set up cooperatives without the permission of the masses. The people in the cooperative were two landlords who had been struggled against, and a lot of land was left for the landlords. This time, the re-examination first rectified the landlords, and the things in the cooperative were immediately distributed, and the whole village started to struggle. As a result, it was found that 60 families in the village were hiding things for the landlords. The re-examination in Shou Zhang is continuing to deepen. In the First District, the landlord Ding Xili in Sunkou deliberately pretended, crying continuously, but after interrogation by the farmers, hundreds of silver dollars, two rickshaws, a bottom-fire pistol, and grain were found.

　　冀鲁豫各地复查深入
    追出地主隐藏财物
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】冀鲁豫各地复查蓬勃展开。南乐在五月中旬召开农民大会后，各村都动起来，特别是三区的小江东、西韩、森固等落后村，在领导上强有力的撑腰下，也已行动起来，查出的东西，比清查时还多。光小江村地主李本素家，就查出埋在地下装有麦子、芝麻、绿豆等大缸一百二十七个，另有铜元一百四十吊，很多农民也把地主存放的东西报出来。进行复查中各村群众掀起换房子运动，韩张一百零八家农民换了房子。在清查中使群众认识了地主本质，纷纷表示要坚决彻底消灭地主，绝不脱漏一个。把地主集中管制，严厉监视他们行动。某小区建立翻身委员会，劳动英雄王自剑被选为主任，他到西韩森固去帮助工作，干部群众都说“彻底”了，但贫农情绪不高，老王就找干部来闲扯，计算地主财富，结果发现三家地主都没斗过，干部认为他们是中农，经老王再三启发与计划，干部思想打通后，召开了贫农大会，才又斗争起来。熊马庄地主在土改后卖豆腐，但复查中，又在他墙内查出银洋九十四元。四区把坏蛋地主恶霸逮捕了四百五十个，接着全区又召开了五千人的农民大会，各村才轰轰烈烈的打开局面。李台村过去土改中所得果实未经群众允许而强行办了合作社，合作社的人是两个被斗地主，给地主留的地也很多，这次复查先整了地主，合作社的东西马上分下去，全村才起来斗争，结果发现村上有六十家给地主藏东西的。寿张复查在继续深入，一区孙口地主丁希厉故意装腔作势，叫哭连天，但经农民审讯后，又追出银洋数百元，洋车两辆，底把匣枪一支及粮食等。
