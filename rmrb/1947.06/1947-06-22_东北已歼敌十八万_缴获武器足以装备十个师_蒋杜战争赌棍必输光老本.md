Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 20th: The victorious offensive of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army has aroused people's amazement and admiration. The reporter inquired about the changes in the enemy-own forces comparison, an important link in the development of the war situation, from the spokesperson of the Democratic Allied Army Headquarters. He said, "There is no need to deny that our strength has greatly increased in the past year. If we trace the reasons, in addition to the enthusiastic participation of the liberated people of Northeast China in the army, supporting the army, and defending their land and democracy, it should also be mentioned that General Du Yuming has delivered a large number of soldiers and American equipment to us."

The spokesperson said, "Before the summer offensive this year, the Chiang-Du army had been annihilated by our army in entire divisions, regiments, and battalions (not counting those below the company level), reaching ten divisions (not counting the local armed groups annihilated and more than 80,000 bandits of Xie Wendong, Li Huatang, Jiang Pengfei and below "vanguard troops"). In the first twenty days of the summer offensive, more than six divisions were destroyed. Of the approximately 180,000 Chiang-Du regular troops annihilated before and after, more than half joined the ranks of the Democratic Allied Army, bringing with them various types of American equipment and ammunition sufficient to equip ten divisions. The serious weakening of the Chiang army in the Northeast and the strengthening of our army have fundamentally changed the war situation in our favor. This is why we were able to recover large areas of lost territory and quickly compress the Chiang-Du army to the surroundings of a few isolated strongholds. Even Du Yuming's lair, Shenyang, was shaken."

The spokesperson continued, "Although the Chiang-Du war gamblers have lost their capital batch by batch, they have always deceived themselves and turned defeats into victories. Their troops were annihilated in regiments, but they shamelessly said that they had 'completely crushed the main force of the Northeast Communist Army'... People can ask Du Yuming: Where are the thirteen regiments of your 71st Army (hereinafter, all refer to the number of regiments annihilated before and after and after replenishment, with four battalions as one regiment, not including those below the company level—Editor)? Where are the five regiments of your New 1st Army? Where are the nine regiments of your 52nd Army, the nine regiments of your 60th Army, the four regiments of your New 6th Army, the six regiments of your 13th Army, the two regiments of your 93rd Army, and the two regiments of the Qing 2nd Division? And where are your more than 60 regimental commanders and above, including division commanders Li Zhengyi, Duan Peide, Zhang Xuetang, Chen Kaiwen, and Chen Chengxiang? The fact that Chiang and Du do not want to and dare not publicly state is: these troops no longer belong to Du Yuming, and except for those who were unnecessarily sacrificed and those who were given money by the Democratic Allied Army to return home and those who entered the 'Liberation Regiment' to study, they are all using the American-made guns and cannons issued by 'Director Du' to fire at 'Director Du'!"

He then said, "Recently, the Central News Agency has again continuously and shamelessly fabricated so-called 'Korean Communist troops' and 'gunners of a certain country' participating in the Democratic Allied Army's operations in order to cover up its惨败 (can3 bai4: disastrous defeat). In fact (the spokesperson smiled), if they changed this non-existent 'Korean Communist troops' to 'Chiang-Du troops' and changed 'gunners of a certain country' to 'American-trained gunners,' that would be accurate and appropriate. It is a pity that they only dare to reveal such facts in their 'top secret' documents."

The spokesperson revealed: Chiang, Du, and the Central News Agency's shameless fabrication is to account to their American masters after the disastrous defeat; (on the 10th of this month, the United Press reporter stationed in Peiping reported this rumor aimed at "attempting to obtain American loans.") It also contains a vicious anti-Soviet conspiracy, attempting to shift the target of the national people's mass resistance against Chiang. Finally, the spokesperson declared in a firm tone: "No matter how Chiang, Du, and their Central News Agency spread rumors, the loss of soldiers and generals and the hatred of the people have made their defeat impossible to reverse. The military and civilians in the Northeast Liberated Areas, plus the millions of people in the newly liberated areas, will continue their efforts to resolutely eliminate the "Second Manchuria" rule of Chiang and Du. The strength of the Democratic Allied Army will continue to grow, and the Chiang-Du army will inevitably continue to transport a large number of soldiers and American equipment to us until their final demise."

　　东北已歼敌十八万
    缴获武器足以装备十个师
    蒋杜战争赌棍必输光老本
    【新华社东北二十日电】东北民主联军的胜利攻势，引起了人们的惊异和赞叹。记者顷以战局发展的重要环节——敌我军力对比的变化情形，就询于民主联军总部发言人，他说：“毋庸讳言，一年来我们的力量是大大壮大了，如果追寻原因的话，那么除了东北解放区翻身人民热烈参军、拥军、保卫田地和民主外，应该提到的还有杜聿明将军运交给我们的大量兵员和美国装备。”
    发言人说：“在今年夏季攻势以前，蒋杜军整师、整团、整营（连以下未计）被我歼灭的，已达十个师（被歼的地方团队及谢文东、李华堂、姜鹏飞以下八万余胡匪“先遣军”未计）。而在夏季攻势的头二十天中，即又有六个多师遭到覆灭。在前后被歼的约十八万蒋杜正规军中，有二分之一以上参加了民主联军的队伍，同时带来了足以装备十个师的各式美械和弹药。东北蒋军的严重削弱和我军的愈战愈强，就使战局起了有利于我的根本变化，这就是为什么我们得以收复大块失地，迅速将蒋杜军压缩到几个孤立的据点周围。连杜聿明的巢穴沈阳都震动了。”
    发言人继指出：“蒋杜辈战争赌棍们虽然一批一批地将老本钱输进去了，但历来都自欺欺人，把败仗说成胜利。他们成团成团的部队被歼灭了，却厚着脸皮说什么‘完全击溃了东北共军主力’…………。人们倒可以问问杜聿明：你的七十一军前后十三个团（以下均指前后被歼及补充后又被歼之数目，以四个营为一团，连以下被歼者未计入——编者）那里去了？你的新一军五个团那里去了？你的五十二军九个团、六十军的九个团、新六军的四个团、十三军的六个多团、九十三军的两个团、青二师的两个团等等，又都到那里去了？你的六十多个团长以上的干部，包括师长李正谊、段培德、张学堂、陈开文、陈呈祥等，今竟何在呢？为蒋杜辈所不愿也不敢公开道出的事实是：这些部队已不再属于杜聿明了，而且除了无谓牺牲者和经民主联军给资返里及入‘解放团’学习者外，都拿着‘杜长官’所发给他们的美制枪炮向‘杜长官’开火了！”
    他接着说：“最近中央社又连续无耻的捏造所谓‘韩共部队’和‘某国炮手’参加民主联军作战，以掩饰其惨败。其实（发言人笑了一笑），如果他们把这莫须有的‘韩共部队’改成‘蒋杜部队’，把‘某国炮手’改为‘美国训练的炮手’那就名符其实、恰如其分了。可惜他们只有在其‘绝密’的文件中，才敢透露这样的实情。”
    发言人揭露：蒋杜及中央社这种无耻捏造，在于惨败之余向其美国主子交账；（本月十日，合众社驻北平的记者即报导这个以“企图取得美国贷款”为目的的造谣。）并包含着恶毒的反苏阴谋，企图转移全国人民群起抗蒋的目标。最后发言人以坚定的口吻宣称：“不管蒋杜及其中央社怎样造谣，兵折将损，民心痛恨，已使他们的败局无法挽救了。东北解放区军民加上新解放区的数百万人民，将再接再厉，坚决消灭蒋杜的“二满洲”统治。民主联军的力量还会继续壮大，而蒋杜军也必然会继续把大量兵员和美械运送给我们，直到他们最后覆亡。”
