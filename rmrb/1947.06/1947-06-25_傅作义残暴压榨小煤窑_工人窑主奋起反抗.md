　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd. Over a thousand workers in the Xuanhua coal mining area, resisting Fu Zuoyi's brutal exploitation, have engaged in armed conflict with mine police. The Xuanhua Baoxing Coal Mine, backed by Fu Zuoyi, forcibly ordered the closure of more than thirty surrounding privately-run small coal mines in early May, immediately provoking resistance from the owners and workers of these small mines. On May 18th, over a hundred small mine owners and workers organized themselves to reason with the Baoxing Coal Mine. At that time, the mine owner bribed dozens of mine police and employed scabs to obstruct the workers' righteous actions, further arousing the workers' resentment. A fierce conflict ensued, with more than ten mine police immediately injured. Seeing the situation was bad, the scabs quietly ran away. Later, Fu Zuoyi's troops stationed in Xiahuayuan came to suppress the workers, ending the conflict. Now, the workers have automatically reopened the more than thirty sealed small mines and declared their determination to fight to the end together with the small mine owners.

　　傅作义残暴压榨小煤窑
    工人窑主奋起反抗
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】宣化煤矿区千余工人反抗傅作义残暴压榨，与矿警发生武装冲突。傅作义支持下的宣化宝兴煤矿，于五月初勒令周围民营的三十余座小煤窑停业，当即引起了这些小煤窑主人和工人的反抗。五月十八日，百余小窑主与工人组织起来，到宝兴煤矿去讲理。当时矿主收买了矿警数十人及工贼出来阻止工人的正义行动，更激起了工人们的愤恨，双方发生激烈冲突，十余名矿警当即被打伤，工贼见势不好悄悄偷跑。后驻下花园傅军赶来镇压，才结束了冲突。现工人们已自动把被封的三十余座小窑启封照开，并宣布协同小窑主一起坚持斗争到底。
