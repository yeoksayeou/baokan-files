Taiyue Frontline Dispatch, 31st: Commander Wang gathered his troops for training. Initially, the cadres wanted him to explain the key points before starting. Commander Wang said, "It's more practical to explain after observing. Explaining without observing is shooting without a target, a method that doesn't start from reality." Everyone listened and began practicing. Commander Wang watched attentively and then selected one or two mutual aid groups to practice according to the actual situation, while the others stood by and watched. After three hours of practice, he gathered the entire battalion on a high ground and selected two mutual aid groups from the Fifth Company to personally direct the action of capturing a hidden bunker. After the demonstration, he asked everyone to express their opinions. Special Class Combat Hero Comrade Zhao Yude said, "There shouldn't be too many or too long for comrades going up to the hidden bunker because in daytime combat, the enemy still has flanking fire cover, which would increase casualties." Commander Wang nodded and said, "That's very correct and good. Who else has something to say?" Then another comrade said, "The pillbox has many gun holes. When throwing grenades, one shouldn't lower their head and shouldn't face the gun holes to avoid getting hit in the head by the enemy." Another comrade said, "During daytime action in open areas, one shouldn't stop; one should desperately advance to the enemy's face or to concealed locations before stopping. Upon reaching the enemy's bunker, one should immediately throw grenades in rapid succession." Yet another comrade said, "The lack of machine gun cover during daytime action is a shortcoming." Another comrade said, "They didn't pay attention to selecting the terrain beforehand, first running to the dirt pile in front and then turning back to advance along the depression."... Everyone offered many suggestions, and Commander Wang praised them repeatedly, saying, "Comrades' opinions are very good." Then he shared his own views: "In the future, we will be fighting mostly village and field battles. The enemy's main reliance is on fortifications, hidden bunkers, and houses. Therefore, the first thing we need to do is train for what we will be fighting, and when training, we must base it on actual conditions and train for what we have. For example, since it's daytime now, we should practice daytime actions and not simulate nighttime actions. Now that there are graves and depressions here, we shouldn't simulate actions on open terrain. If it's open terrain, we shouldn't simulate actions with depressions and graves. When simulating situations, don't be ambiguous; use flags to mark them." "During today's exercise, some called for odd numbers to advance and even numbers to cover, or even numbers to advance and odd numbers to cover. This is useless mutual aid. Cadres should unleash the creativity and initiative of the mutual aid groups. In the future, when given a task, let them boldly display their talent. Every move must be decisive, and bravery is necessary to avoid unnecessary casualties." Commander Wang's training method is a method of "from the masses, to the masses," concentrating and promoting everyone's wisdom, and then using it to guide work methods. Now, this method has been promoted throughout the entire regiment.

Taiyue Frontline Dispatch, 31st: When a certain unit's Second Platoon was training, they adopted Commander Wang's method of combining practice and research. They had three combat mutual aid groups, led by Comrade Li Hong of the Fifth Squad, perform the actions while the other two squads evaluated. After more than ten minutes of exercise, everyone saw many shortcomings and immediately convened a research meeting. They found that the main shortcomings were that the mutual aid group leader only ran in front, often losing contact, making it inconvenient to command, and when searching the courtyard, they rushed in rashly without carefully listening for enemies inside. After reviewing and practicing again, the difference was obvious. They placed an experienced squad leader in the middle, and they became more vigilant and serious when advancing into the courtyard. During the break, everyone conducted another review. Comrade Ren Beiquan said, "When I approached the courtyard to throw the grenade, I didn't block the door. If a real enemy rushed out, I would definitely suffer." The Fifth Squad leader ran to the street entrance and demonstrated it again for everyone, explaining as he went. In this way, by explaining, learning, and researching together, everyone quickly learned the skills.

Yubei Frontline Dispatch, 31st: Model squad leader Shi Yulun of a certain unit of the Liberation Army summarized three criteria for judging whether a newly liberated soldier had been properly educated: First, to see if he understands the democratic style of the Liberation Army. If he speaks frankly and dares to frankly raise opinions about superiors and comrades, then he truly understands. Second, to see if he helps backward comrades progress. If he sees newly liberated soldiers who are uneasy or have bad behaviors, he will persuade and educate them. Third, to see if he respects and helps the common people. The political director of the unit believed that these three points not only summarized the basic characteristics of evaluating newly liberated soldiers but also illustrated the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's soldiers and the people, as well as the people's soldiers' sense of responsibility for the people's cause and the democratic style of the people's army. All these were completely different from Chiang Kai-shek's private feudal army.

　　太岳王团的练兵方法
    从实地情况出发边作边研究集中群众智慧再练进步很快
    【本报太岳前线三十一日电】王团长召集了他的部队练兵，开始干部们都要求他先把要领讲了再作。王团长说：“先看了再讲才实际，不看先讲是无的放矢，是不从实际出发的方法。”大家听了就先作起来，王团长聚精会神的看着，然后又叫抽出一两个互助组，按实地的情况去练习，其余的人都站在旁边看。作了三个小时，他又将全营集中到一个高地，另抽出五连两个互助组，亲自指挥作夺取暗碉的动作。作完后，他让全体发表意见。特等战斗英雄赵玉德同志说：“上到暗碉上的同志不应多，不应久待，因白天战斗，敌人还有旁边的火力掩护，这样就会增加伤亡。”王团长听了点点头说：“说的很对，很好，别人再说吧！”于是又有个同志说：“地碉枪眼多，投弹时不应低着头，还不应对着枪眼，免得被敌人打住脑袋。”又有个同志说：“白天在开阔地动作不应停止，应该拚命的进到敌人跟前，或者到隐蔽地再停止。冲到敌碉堡跟前，应马上投弹，一连气的扔下去。”又有同志说：“白天动作没机枪掩护，是个缺点。”另一个同志说：“他们事先选择地形不注意，先跑到前边的土堆，后又扭转回来顺着地＠凹地前进。”……大家提了许多意见，王团长听了一连称赞道：“同志们的意见非常好，接着才说出他自己的意见：“我们今后打村落野外战多，敌人的主要依托是工事、暗碉、房屋，那么我们第一就要打什么练什么，炼的时候又要根据实际情况，有什么练什么。比方这时正是白天，就要作白天的动作，不要假设夜间动作。现在这里有坟堆，有地＠，就不要假设作开阔地形的动作，如果是开阔地，也不要假设作有地＠坟堆的动作。假设情况也不要含糊，要用旗子来标明。”“今天演习时，有的叫单数前进双数掩护，或双数前进单数掩护，这样互助是没有用的，干部应发挥互助组的创造性积极性。今后给了任务，就叫他大胆的发扬自己的天才。一举一动不能犹豫，要勇猛才能避免不必要的伤亡。”王团长的练兵方法，是从群众中来到群众中去的方法，集中与发扬了大家的智慧，再以之去指导工作方法。现在这个方法，已在全团推行开了。
    【本报太岳前线三十一日电】某部二排练兵时，采用了王团长的实习与研究并进的方法，把三个战斗互助组由五班的李红＠同志带领作动作，其它两个班作评判。演习了十几分钟，大家看到不少缺点，马上就召开研究会，研究出主要缺点是互助小组长光在前边跑，往往失掉连络，不便指挥，到院里搜索时，不细听里面有无敌人就冒失进去。检讨下来再练，这下就显然不同了，把一个有经验的小组长放在当中，往院里发展的时候，也机警认真了。休息时，大家又进行检讨。任倍全同志说：“我接近院子往里投炸弹，没有把门卡住，若要真有敌人冲出来，我非吃亏不可。”五班长跑到街门口，连说带作又给大家作了一遍。这样边说边学边研究，很快都学会了本事。
    【本报豫北前线三十一日电】解放军某部模范班长史玉轮，总结了三个判断解放战士是否已经教育好的标准：第一、看他是否懂得了解放军的民主作风。如果他说话坦白，对上级对同志有意见都敢坦白提，便是真正懂了。第二、看他是否帮助落后同志的进步，如他看见新解放来的战士有不安心的现象或不好的表现，就去说服他教育他。第三、看他是否尊重老百姓，帮助老百姓。该部政治部主任以为这三条不仅总结了评定解放战士的基本特点，而且说明了人民战士和人民血肉相连的关系，以及人民战士对人民事业的责任感和人民军队的民主作风，这都是和蒋介石私人的封建军队截然不同的。
