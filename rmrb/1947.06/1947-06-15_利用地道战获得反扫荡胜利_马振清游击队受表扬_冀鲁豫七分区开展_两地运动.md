　　[Report from this newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 12th] The Fifth Sub-district’s Kaocheng Ma Zhenqing Guerrilla Team achieved victory in counter-raids by using tunnel warfare. The sub-district headquarters issued a special commendation. On the 16th, when the “mopping-up” began, more than 2,000 Chiang troops attacked in three routes. Ma Zhenqing and more than ten comrades from the armed work team, including veteran guerrilla members Wang Honggu and Wang Chao, relied on tunnels to resist the enemy in a certain village, covering the transfer of the masses. They repelled several charges by Chiang's troops, killing or wounding seven enemies. Later, they went down into the tunnels, leaving a few outside to strike at and confuse the enemy. After Chiang's troops entered the village, they discovered the tunnel entrance and forced soldiers to go down, but no one dared. The enemy then used methods such as burning, filling the tunnel entrance, and digging, but still achieved no results. Fearing they would come out again, the enemy set up sentry posts at the tunnel entrance, but they came out of another tunnel entrance in the village in the middle of the night. Coincidentally, the enemy was passing by there with a large cart of wheat. Four Chiang soldiers were involved, one was killed, one was captured alive, and the other two ran away. They recovered a large cart of wheat and obtained four rifles. On the 19th, they attacked Chiang's troops who were robbing grain in the vegetable garden. One enemy was killed, three were wounded, and several carts of grain were taken back. At present, tunnel warfare is continuing to be carried out.
　　[Report from this newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 11th] In order to carry out a widespread "Two-Area" (landmine and tunnel) and militia killing-the-enemy-and-merit-making movement, the Seventh Sub-district Military Commission held a joint meeting of county directors on May 27. After summarizing the heroic achievements of the militia since the guerrilla war, it conducted a detailed review of past militia work and determined the three major tasks for the future: (1) Vigorously carry out the Two-Area movement, so that landmines and tunnels are well combined, and the explosion movement should become the direction of military development for the militia. (2) Restore and develop the militia on a large scale to become a true armed force of the peasant class, and propose to the militia the guarantee of "no conscription, no removal, protecting the fields and protecting the home" in the restoration and development. (3) Carry out the killing-the-enemy-and-merit-making movement, and cultivate and educate the heroes who have emerged this time to become militia backbones.

　　利用地道战获得反扫荡胜利
    马振清游击队受表扬
    冀鲁豫七分区开展“两地运动”
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】五分区考城马振清游击队利用地道斗争，获得了反扫荡胜利，分区司令部特通令表扬。十六日“扫荡”开始，蒋军二千余人三路合击，马振清及武工队老头游击队员王洪姑、王朝等十余同志依靠地道，在某村阻击敌人，掩护群众转移。击退蒋军数次冲锋，毙伤敌七名。以后下到洞里，留少数在外打击和迷惑敌人。蒋军进村后，发现洞口，强迫士兵下去，但谁也不敢下，敌人遂用火烧、填洞口、挖洞等办法，但仍未获得任何效果。敌人怕他们再出来，在洞口设上岗，但他们到了半夜从村子的另一个洞口出来了。恰巧敌人拉了一大车麦子从那里经过，四个蒋军一个被击毙，一个被活捉，某余两个都跑了，收回麦子一大车，得了四支大枪。十九日又打了菜园抢粮蒋军，敌被击毙一人，伤三人，拿回粮食几车。目前地道斗争正继续开展中。
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】七分区武委会为开展广泛的“两地”（地雷、地道）及民兵杀敌立功运动，特于五月二十七日召开县主任联席会议，总结了游击战争以来民兵英勇的战绩后，对过去民兵工作作了详细的检讨，并确定今后的三大任务：（一）大力开展两地运动，使地雷地道很好结合，爆炸运动应成为民兵军事发展的方向。（二）大量恢复发展民兵成为真正的农民阶级武装，在恢复发展中向民兵提出保证“不编不拔，保田保家”。（三）开展杀敌立功运动，把这次出现的英雄很好的培养教育成为民兵骨干。
