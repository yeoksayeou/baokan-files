Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th. Triumphant news has arrived from both the Huainan and Huaibei regions under Chiang's control. A portion of the People's Liberation Army, advancing into the Huainan region under Chiang's control, successfully captured Ta'erji, northeast of Tongcheng on the west bank of Gaoyou Lake, on the 19th of last month. Over a hundred defending enemies fled upon hearing the news. One company of engineers from Chiang's 4th Reorganized Division reinforced them, resulting in fierce fighting. Three platoons were annihilated, and the enemy's Major Battalion Deputy Sun Zhongrui and Company Deputy Li Jiefu, along with fifty others, were captured. Thirteen American-made Thompson submachine guns, one rifle grenade launcher, over twenty rifles, ten thousand rounds of ammunition, and four telephones were seized. The local armed forces persisting in the Huai (yin) Si (yang) area of Huaibei shattered the "encirclement and suppression" of Chiang's troops, who had mustered over a regiment in strength, starting on the 20th of last month. Near the Yunhe canal line between Huaiyin and Siyang, in Shenjiazhuang, Mopan, Sancha, and other locations, a hundred Chiang's puppet soldiers were captured, and twenty-three were killed. The area has entirely returned to its original state.
