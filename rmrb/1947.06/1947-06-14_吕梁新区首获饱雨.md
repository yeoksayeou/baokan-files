Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 11th -- The newly liberated counties of Xiangning, Xiangling, Fencheng, Xinjiang, Jishan, and Hejin in the Lyuliang District received their first copious rain on the morning of the 8th, which lasted until the morning of the 9th. The soil was moistened to a depth of over a foot, making it possible to sow crops on all the stubble fields after the wheat harvest. The autumn crops planted in early May are growing even more vigorously. The broad masses who have been newly liberated are even more invigorated.
