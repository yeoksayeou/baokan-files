　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 14th Telegram: The People's Liberation Army of East Hebei's counterattack in Luan East has kicked off the summer offensive in the area. According to a public announcement from the East Hebei Military Region, in this campaign, the army successively liberated the three county towns of Changli (now evacuated), Funing, and Shu'an, as well as over twenty large and small stations and strongholds such as Houfengtai, Liushouying, and Zhangjiazhuang. In total, it annihilated over 2,900 enemy troops from the Fifth and Eighth Regiments of the pseudo-security Third Division and other units, seized ten small cannons, twenty-five machine guns, over 2,700 rifles and carbines, and nearly 200,000 rounds of various ammunition. In addition, over a hundred enemy bunkers, nine iron bridges, and two trains, including one locomotive, were destroyed.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji) 14th Telegram: In the Luan East campaign, liberated peasants enthusiastically participated in the war. In the area of the Luan (River) East Sub-district alone, from the Great Wall line in the north to Changli City in the south, and from the Qinglong River in the west to Shanhaiguan in the east, covering over ten thousand square miles, more than 50,000 people directly participated in the campaign actions. Qingshankou, a place on the Great Wall hundreds of miles away from Changli, was celebrating the great emancipation of the peasants by performing shadow plays. When the district head announced on stage that our army was going to attack Changli City, the young and middle-aged people below the stage couldn't wait for the call to organize, and automatically shouldered stretchers and rushed to the front line overnight. Li Haixin, a labor hero and the stationmaster of a certain village's general supply station, organized and directed the transportation of stretchers and military rations back and forth for three sleepless nights. On the 18th of last month, at a certain supply station, during the most intense fighting, more than 130 wounded soldiers were transported calmly in one day. During the battle of Shimensai, in a village in Linyu, the men went to the front line, and the village's office work was all handled by women. At the supply station, women washed the blood clots off the wounded and personally fed them the steamed buns and porridge they had brought themselves. During the fighting along the Beining Railway, Comrade Zhang Biqing, the district head of the Third District of Lulong, led more than 2,000 militiamen and more than 100 stretchers to serve the front line, traveling over eighty miles and staying awake for three days and three nights.
