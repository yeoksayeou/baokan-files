　　Our Army Advances on Both Sides of the Ying River, Liberates Jieshou, Captures 400 Enemies
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The Yu-Wan-Su People's Liberation Army, which has penetrated deep into northern Anhui, has once again crossed the Wo River and advanced on both sides of the Ying River. At dawn on May 19, the People's Liberation Army liberated the important stronghold of Jieshou in Taihe, annihilating one battalion each of the security regiments from Fuyang, Shenqiu, and Linquan counties, as well as two Jiang-controlled township public offices. In addition to those killed and wounded, a total of more than 400 enemy personnel, from deputy battalion commander down, were captured, and seven light machine guns, ten vehicles, and more than 200 rifles were seized. The vanguard rapid units of the force are currently advancing towards Shenqiu, Linquan, and other counties by vehicle. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region has issued a commendation order to praise the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army in the area, which has adopted a lenient and mobile strategy, penetrated deep into the rear of Jiang's forces, continuously captured important towns such as Xihua, Fugou, and Mengcheng, and annihilated large numbers of Jiang's puppet troops, expanding the liberated areas, and has praised them as models of persisting in the struggle behind enemy lines.
    [Report from This Newspaper] The Taihang Fourth Military Subdistrict troops launched a fierce guerrilla war against the enemy strongholds along the Daoqing Railway, in order to coordinate with the upcoming wheat harvest defense campaign. On the evening of the 10th of last month, our Suncun unit and the 44th unit launched an assault on the more than 200 personnel of the special office of the great traitor Zhang Jingzhong, stationed in Qianzhuang Village, three miles southwest of Baijianfang, the transportation hub between Jiaozuo and Xiuwu. At 5 a.m., they broke into the village. Comrade Hou Wangqi, an engineer, under the cover of infantry, destroyed a large bunker and captured another. In this battle, one light machine gun was seized, more than ten enemy troops were killed or wounded, and an entire squad of the enemy was crushed to death in the bunker. On the evening of the 14th, the Suncun unit, in coordination with the 44th unit, launched a strong attack on Baizhuang, an outer stronghold of Daiwang. The puppet self-defense regiment fled upon hearing the news. We captured one enemy messenger and seized all the official seals and documents of the Majie Township, liberating more than 100 mountain people who had been driven down the mountains by the enemy. On the morning of the 12th, the Xiuwu Second and Third District Militia Work Team, in coordination with the Lingchuan Militia Platoon, ambushed the enemy heading towards Dongshuizhai at Dongbanqiao. Four puppet self-defense members were killed on the spot, two were captured alive, and three short guns were obtained. On the 16th, the Huojia Detachment set out for Beifan. Just as dawn broke, our mobile sentry encountered the enemy, who were carrying two mortars and one heavy machine gun, and launched an attack on Nanguanzhuang. Our detachment resolutely resisted for several hours, and the enemy's two attempts to charge were repelled. The enemy suffered sixteen deaths and injuries, while we suffered no casualties. On the 19th, the enemy at Mulandiandian launched an attack on Xiaogao. Our detachment, in coordination with the Wuzhi Second Detachment, launched a flank attack on Xiaogao. Under our barrage of hand grenades, the enemy fled south. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 30 deaths and injuries, while we suffered one death and one injury. On the morning of the 21st, at 8 a.m., the Suncun unit ambushed the Jinzuo, where one enemy vehicle was driving from Jiaozuo to Xiuwu. When the enemy vehicle entered our ambush circle, the machine gun fired, and the infantry immediately rushed up. A volley of hand grenades killed four regular army soldiers and two miscellaneous soldiers, and captured five enemy personnel, including a major supply director. A batch of military supplies was seized, and a vehicle was destroyed. (Communication Team of the Fourth Military Subdistrict Political Department)
