　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 4th dispatch】Jianbei Village, Qinyuan, organized 34 mutual aid teams and started harvesting wheat on the 23rd of last month. All men, women, and children in the village were投入all投入 into this intense harvest struggle. They truly achieved "not a single person idle, not a single scythe resting." They went out early and returned late every day, using gongs as a signal. At the sound of the gong in the early morning, they gathered in the streets. Women and children carried baskets on their shoulders and held scythes in their hands, full of enthusiasm. In the evening, they came back to hold group meetings to evaluate and calculate work points. The order of priority for harvesting was for families of soldiers, martyrs, conscripted laborers, and rotating militia, then taking care of the widowed and orphaned. They harvested wherever the wheat was ripe first. Peasant Chang Wu did not participate in the mutual aid team, but Zhao Erying, a member of the Women's Federation Standing Committee, led a team to harvest for him. He was very moved and asked to join the mutual aid team.
　　【This newspaper】After completing cotton planting, Tian'erzhuang in the Ninth District of Wu'an is now leading the masses to harvest wheat. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient labor for the wheat harvest, the village held a mass meeting of the whole village on the night of the 30th and 31st of this month, and worked out the following methods: 1. All men, women, young and old in the village, except for pregnant and sick women who stay at home to cook and take care of children, participate in the wheat harvest mutual aid movement. 2. All full and semi-laborers in the village were divided into four wheat harvest mutual aid teams. 3. Their slogan is not a single person idle, not a single scythe resting. Whoever's wheat ripens first, they will harvest for them first, giving priority to harvesting the wheat of soldiers, workers, families of martyrs, and participating personnel, and those without labor. Now the emancipated masses in the village are joyfully carrying out the wheat harvest after the first emancipation. Every household is sharpening scythes and carrying water to sprinkle the threshing ground. It is expected that the harvest will be completed around the 20th of the lunar calendar.
