    Gao Yunting Implements Production Plan
    Whole Family Discusses Democratically, Everyone Produces Enthusiastically
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch on the 1st] Gao Yunting, a liberated labor hero from Yuan Village, Tunliu, is gradually realizing his production plan set at the beginning of this year. Old Gao plans for the whole family to spin 96 jin of cotton throughout the year. By early May, 33 jin had been completed. Of the 45 bolts of cloth to be woven, 15 bolts have already been woven. The autumn seedlings are also growing exceptionally well due to careful cultivation and meticulous farming, with an expected increase of one dou of grain per mu. In addition, Old Gao also weaves mats in his spare time, earning one dou of millet per day. According to Old Gao, the smooth progress of his production plan is mainly due to the development of family democracy. He holds three meetings on time every month, where his son and daughter-in-law can raise any opinions and report any contributions. Secondly, a bonus system is implemented. If the daughter-in-law completes the cotton spinning task, the bonus is divided 20/80 (80% for the family, 20% for herself). If the task is exceeded, the bonus is divided 30/70 (70% for the family, 30% for herself). Raising pigs, weaving cloth, and feeding livestock are all assigned bonuses based on labor. The whole family makes a plan every two months, summarizes it once, and distributes bonuses once. Old Gao and his eldest son each lead a mutual aid team. Whether it is plowing the land or sowing seeds, they always put others first and themselves last. The fourth daughter-in-law's husband joined the army, and she not only declined preferential treatment but also strove to make military shoes. She said, "My man also needs to wear shoes at home, so I will make them for him now." Under the influence of Gao Yunting's family, 90% of the labor force in the whole village has been organized, and the scale of production exceeds any previous year. The land has been generally cultivated and farmed meticulously. Eighty percent of the corn and millet has been plowed twice, and the amount of manure applied is on average one-third more than in previous years. It is estimated that each mu of land will increase grain production by one dou.

　　高云亭贯彻生产计划
    全家民主商讨人人生产带劲
    【本报太岳一日电】屯留原村翻身劳动英雄高云亭，今年元旦所订的生产计划已在逐步实现。老高原计划全家全年纺花九十六斤，至五月初已完成卅三斤，织布四十五匹，也已织出十五匹，秋苗也因精耕细作而长得异常茂盛，预计每亩可增产粮一斗。此外老高每天还趁空编席，可赚小米一斗。据老高谈，其生产计划之得以顺利进行，主要是开展了家庭民主。他每月按时召开三次会议，儿子、媳妇有甚意见都可提，有什功劳都可报。其次实行了分红制，媳妇纺花达到任务者二八分红（家八私二），超过任务者三七分红（家七私三），喂猪、织布、喂牲口都按劳力定分分红利，全家两月订一次计划，总结一次，分红一次，老高与大儿子全发各领导一个互助组，不管犁地下种，总是先别人后自己，四媳妇男人参军了，不仅谢绝优待，并争做军鞋。她说：“俺男人在家也得穿鞋，现在就当给他做”。在高云亭家庭的影响下，全村百分之九十的劳力都组织起来，生产规模超过以往任何一年，土地普遍进行了精耕细作，玉茭谷子百分之八十犁过两遍，粪土平均较往年多上三分之一，每亩地预计可增产粮一斗。
