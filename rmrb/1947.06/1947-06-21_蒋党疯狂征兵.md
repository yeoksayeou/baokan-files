　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th: According to a comprehensive Shanghai newspaper report: The Chiang clique recently planned to "recruit" 30,000 soldiers in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui provinces.休宁 County, Anhui Province, originally planned to conscript 420 soldiers, but only managed to capture over 300. 环居, 阳湖, 万安 and other townships have not yet met their quotas. The county government, unable to explain the situation, even押送 eight 保长 (heads of 100 households) from these townships to the regimental district as collateral. It is scheduled to start conscription in Jiangnan on June 1st. Shanghai has already organized a conscription association, and the Southern Jiangsu Garrison District has also telegraphed various counties to prepare. In order to prevent eligible young men from hiding and escaping, Chiang's Ministry of National Defense has issued an order to all counties to conscientiously implement "joint guarantee" and "mutual responsibility." Conscription has also begun in Beiping. The regimental district has already taken in more than 300 people, but one-third of them are disabled, one-tenth are sick, and the oldest is as old as seventy-two years old.

    【新华社华中十九日电】综合沪报讯：蒋党近拟于苏鲁豫皖四拾募”兵三万，安徽休宁县本拟征兵四百二十名，但到处抓捕仅得三百余名，环居、阳湖、万安等乡迄未征齐。该县县府因无法交代，竟将各该乡八个保长押送团管区作抵。江南定六月一日开始征兵，上海已组织兵役协会，苏南师管区亦电告各县准备。蒋记国防部为防止适龄壮丁隐藏逃避，已通令各县切实办理“纵横具结”、“连保连坐”。又北平征兵亦已开始，团管区已收容三百多名，但其中三分之一是残废，十分之一有病的，最大年纪竟有七十二岁者。
