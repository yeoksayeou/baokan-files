[This report from our newspaper in Zuoquan] Following the issuance of the county's emergency call to rush planting, replanting, rescue efforts against drought, practicing thrift, and preparing for famine, villages in Zuoquan such as Qinquan, Cheshangpu, Xishan, Lianggou, Dananzhuang, Sucheng, and Tongtan, under the influence of cadres and heroes who took the lead in setting thrift and famine preparedness plans and personally participating in rush planting, immediately launched a campaign for rush planting, drought resistance, thrift, and famine preparedness. For example, Jia Fukui, a labor hero from Tongtan; Wang Shimin, the political director of Silizhuang; Zhao Tianshun, a councilor from Sucheng; and the village chief of Cheshangpu, after formulating their own thrift plans, convened mass meetings. Starting from recalling the famine of 1943 and the hunger, Shen Wujiu from Tongtan said, "Thinking back to 1943, when we ate bran and couldn't even defecate, we must make plans early." Old Han Zhang Wujin said, "It won't do to only look at the present and not think about the future. Even though we have turned ourselves over, we must be careful and thrifty." The discussions cleared up the masses' thoughts of waiting for rain, complacency, and wastefulness. In everyone's recollections, they brought out the experiences of carrying water, digging canals, resisting drought, and rushing to plant in 1943. The leadership immediately seized the masses' thoughts and put forward slogans such as "People don't wait for rain, fight against drought, plant one more plant, eat one more meal." The masses promoted the experience of changing stubble to plant. Aiyukou carried out dry planting, and two canals were opened in the river ditches, which could irrigate 40 mu of land; Zhao Tianshun, a councilor from Sucheng, and others led the masses to repair two canals in five days, irrigating more than 200 mu of land, carrying water to plant 63 mu of corn, and rush-planting and replanting 67 mu of millet. Each village also formulated thrift and famine preparedness plans. Wang Shimin, the political director of Silizhuang, calculated that his family's grain was not enough to eat for a year. After calculating the total, he decided to save three taels of rice per person per day, supplemented by bran and vegetables, which could save four dan and five dou per year. Under his influence, the whole village uniformly decided to save three taels of rice per person per day. The masses also launched a merit competition. The village chief of Songshuping proposed to save half a jin of rice per day and not smoke paper cigarettes in the merit competition. Tongtan also formulated six thrift measures, such as only eating ten jin of noodles for weddings, not drinking alcohol, and not smoking. At the same time, they further promoted the tradition of women picking vegetables to save rice and mastering thrift. Women in villages such as Lianggou and Dananzhuang proposed: "Thrift is the main thing that our women should be responsible for. Saving four taels of rice per person per day is not too much, because we cook the meals, and how much we save depends on us." After discussion, they unanimously proposed to save millet to fill their stomachs, add more wild vegetables to the pot, spin more cotton, weave more cloth, and feed more pigs with vegetables. Each person prepared five jin of dried vegetables. Under these conditions, a thrift inspection committee was selected to conduct regular inspections. Women in villages such as Qinquan decided to use less rice when cooking, cooking it thick and saving rice, ensuring that they would not eat broken rice, saving more wild vegetables and eating more bran, and implementing this work practically and specifically under the control of women for a long time. They also seized the organization of sideline production from a proactive aspect, so that spare money was used to buy salt and oil, and no rice was sold. For example, Baiyu Village in the Seventh District, in addition to earning more than 387,000 yuan by cutting mountains, transporting, digging medicinal herbs, and burning pine tar in half a month, proposed to save grain, so that they would not sell even one dou of rice for pocket money, save 600 jin of firewood, save 30 jin of oil, and save 15,000 yuan, achieving comprehensive production and thrift. In addition, some of the masses who were allocated flat land during spring plowing and sowing did not want to plant slopes. The leadership proposed to prepare more late-season crop seeds and vegetable seeds to eliminate barren land and produce more grain, overcoming the "forgetting slopes when there is flat land" mentality. In order to implement the "cultivate three, surplus one" principle, Lianggou formulated a plan to reclaim one mu of wasteland per person to plant autumn vegetables, so as to save on famine preparations and increase production.

　　发挥采菜省米传统
    左权妇女掌握节约
    柏峪吃盐点油不粜米梁沟开荒种秋菜
    【本报左权讯】左权各区接到县紧急抢种补种抢救抗旱节约备荒号召后，芹泉车上铺西山梁沟大南庄粟城桐滩等村，在干部英雄首订节约备荒计划与亲自动手抢种影响下，立即展开抢种抗旱节约备荒运动。如桐滩劳英贾富魁，四里庄政治主任王世民，粟城参议员赵天顺，车上铺村长等，在自己订出节约计划后，召开群众大会，从回忆四三年灾荒饿肚讨论起，桐滩申五九说：“想起四三年吃糠大便不下来，咱可得早些作打算。”老汉张五斤说：“过时光只瞧眼前不瞧眼后可不行，虽然翻了身，更得细水长流，经常俭省。”讨论中打通群众等雨自满浪费等思想，在你一句我一句回忆中，发挥出四三年担水开渠抗旱抢种经验，领导上即抓紧群众思想，提出“人不等雨向旱灾作斗争，多栽一棵多吃一顿”等口号，群众发扬改茬种经验，隘峪口进行了干种，河沟地开渠两道，可灌田四十亩；粟城参议员赵天顺等领导群众五天内修渠两道，共浇地二百多亩，担水栽玉茭六十三亩，抢种补种谷六十七亩。各村并订出了节约备荒计划。四里庄政治主任王世民，按他家一年算下来粮食不够吃，经过算总账，按每人每日省米三两，以糠菜来补助，全年能省四石五，全村在他影响下，统一定出每日每人省米三两。群众并展开了立功竞赛，松树坪村长在立功竞赛中提出每日省米半斤，不吸纸烟。桐滩也订出结婚只吃十斤面，不喝酒不吸烟等六项节约办法。同时，更发挥妇女们采菜省米掌握节约传统，如梁沟大南庄等村妇女们提出：“节约是咱妇女们应负责的主要事，按每人每日省四两米不算多，因咱做饭哩，多少省费全靠咱们。”经过讨论，一致提出节约小米吃饱肚，增加野菜锅里煮，多纺花多织布，吃菜也要多喂猪。每人准备干菜五斤。在这些条件下，并选出节约检查委员会定期检查。芹泉等村妇女决定做饭少下米，熬的又糊又省米，保证不吃破米饭，多挽野菜多吃糠，把这一工作按实际情况精确而具体的在妇女掌握下长期贯彻下去。更从积极方面抓紧组织副业生产，作到零花吃盐点油不粜米。如七区柏峪村，除半月砍山运输刨药材烧柏油共赚洋三十八万七千多元外，提出为了节约粮食，作到零花不粜一斗米，省柴六百斤，省油三十斤，省洋一万五，作到全面生产节约。另外，在春耕下种中有些群众分到平地后不想种坡地，领导上即提出多准备晚庄稼种籽与菜籽，作到消灭熟荒多打粮，克服“有平忘坡”思想。梁沟为了贯彻耕三余一，在节约备荒中订出每人开生荒一亩种秋菜，作到节约备荒又增产。（左权县联合办公室）
