Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th: The military and civilians here are engaged in a tense summer harvest, with some areas also conducting summer hoeing simultaneously. The Luzhong and Binhai areas began harvesting wheat around the time of Mangzhong (Grain in Ear). Lìchéng, Zīchuān, and Zhāngqiū counties have completed the cutting of all 503,000 mu of wheat fields. The Bohai area is currently engaged in storing wheat, summer planting, and transportation. The new and old areas of Gaoyuan and twelve other counties in the Bohai area have also begun harvesting. Various border areas are展开carrying out armed protection of wheat against the enemy. The Luzhong Working Team repelled 19 attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops attempting to seize wheat from the 1st to the 3rd of this month. On the 7th, when the 48th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek's army attacked Jucheng, villages within ten miles of the enemy were simultaneously posting sentries and harvesting. The central area put forward the slogan "Harvest and hand over public grain quickly, so that the front lines can win victories." Men, women, old and young in each village went to the fields to harvest together. In Wangjiadazhuang, Junan, seven large mutual aid teams had 74 women with partial labor capacity. The village implemented a meritorious service campaign during the wheat harvest, recording merits while harvesting in the fields, and watering sweet potato seedlings under the moonlight in the evening. A certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army helped the masses with the summer harvest and hoeing, hoeing nearly a thousand mu of land in one day.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th: Yixian, Mancheng, Xushui and other places on both sides of Pinghan Railway are now universally carrying out wheat harvesting. The yield of paddy fields averages 20 *shi* (a unit of dry volume) per mu, while the harvest of dry land is not as good as in previous years due to lack of rain. Wheat harvesting in various places is being carried out in close combination with land re-investigation. In Xizhaozhuang, 7th District of Yixian, the people harvest during the day and distribute land at night. In Beizhaozhuang, two-thirds of the village are allocated to harvest and one-third to work on the re-investigation. The two groups rotate to ensure that neither task is delayed. The peasant group of the Consolidation Village in Xushui are assigned to cutting wheat, and they use the rest time at the edge of the fields to discuss land re-investigation. The front lines near the enemy widely carry out armed protection of wheat. The militia of Gangtou and more than ten other villages in the 7th District of Mancheng organize joint defense operations. Men, women, old and young are concentrating all their efforts on rushing the harvest.

　　山东等地紧张夏收
    【新华社山东十六日电】此间军民紧张夏收，部分地区并同时进行夏锄。鲁中、滨海地区芒种前后即开始收麦。历城、淄川、章邱三县五十万三千亩麦田已悉数割完。渤海区现正从事藏麦、夏种及转运。渤海区高苑等十二个县新老地区亦已开镰。各边沿区展开武装护麦的对敌斗争。鲁中武工队自本月一日至三日曾击退十九次蒋伪抢麦活动。七日蒋军四十八师犯莒城时，离敌十里以外的村庄均一面放哨一面收割。中心区提出“快割快打缴公粮，前方才能打胜仗”的口号。各村男女老弱一齐下地收割，莒南王家大庄七个大变工组中，有七十四个妇女半劳力，该村麦收中贯彻立功运动，在地里一边收一边评功记功，晚上并在月下浇地瓜秧。华东人民解放军某部帮助群众夏收、夏锄，一日内即锄地近千亩。
    【新华社晋察冀十六日电】平汉两侧易县、满城、徐水等地现已普遍开展麦收。水地产量平均二十市斗，旱田因缺雨收成不如往年。各地麦收均系与土地复查密切结合进行。易县七区西赵庄白天收割，夜晚分田。北赵庄则是全村抽出三分之二的人收割，三分之一的人搞复查。轮流拨换，两不误事。徐水巩固庄复查中之农民小组即拨工割麦，利用地头休息时间讨论土地复查。前方接敌地区广泛开展武装护麦斗争。满城七区岗头等十余村民兵则组织联防作战。男女老少正集中一切力量从事抢收。
