    Extorts Funds, Pressgangs Laborers, and Embezzles Relief Supplies
    Three Thousand People in Chengguan Launch General Liquidation

    [Report from Tangyin by this newspaper] On May 5th, over three thousand impoverished citizens and refugees in Chengguan, Tangyin gathered to launch a struggle of accusation and reasoning against Su Boyin, the director of the Chiang-puppet Tangyin County Relief Institute. It is reported that Su is a tyrannical landlord owning eleven qing of land in Tangyin city. Before the counter-offensive, he served as a clerk in the Civil Affairs Section of the puppet county government and as a district member of the First District (actually controlling the district government). In March of last year, he also became the director of the Chiang-puppet Tangyin County Relief Institute. At the meeting, the masses were extremely indignant at his embezzlement of relief materials and his indifference to the plight of the poor. Wu Qingde, a 65-year-old man from Beiguan, accused Su, saying, "I don't have a single house or a single piece of land, and I'm hungry all day long. How much have you helped me?" The whole audience shouted: He hasn't helped a single poor person in the city or the six passes! I am his neighbor, Su Boyin's, and I can't even get half a bit of relief! An old woman next to him said angrily, "I went to ask him, that Su, to help me, and he cursed me and told me to go find the county magistrate (puppet county magistrate) for approval. He really has no sympathy for the poor!" The whole audience shouted: Down with the traitorous tyrannical landlord Su Boyin! Then the masses questioned him about where the materials had gone. According to Su's own confession, he received five million yuan in legal tender and four thousand bags of foreign flour in a single instance. He used it to provide relief to landlords in Luxi (including some landlords in Lin County), with three thousand eight hundred bags of foreign flour and four million five hundred thousand yuan in legal tender. The remaining part was given to landlords and large households in the city. The masses confirmed that American-style high-bottom leather shoes and other items were given to the wives of wealthy households to wear. The head of the Bao, Gao Xizhou, exposed Su, saying, "Not only do you not help the poor, but every time the Bao is assigned grain and money, you are in charge. You assign more to the poor. Without your signature, it can't be assigned. Now you owe countless workers and over three thousand jin of grain. Isn't that all paid for by the poor!" At this point, the masses shouted: Oppose equal distribution! Oppose oppressing the poor! Chen Babang, a fifteen-year-old child from Beiguan, said, "My six houses were all demolished by Sun Dianying. I fled to the Yue Wang Temple in the city with my mother to take refuge. You, Su Boyin, said the county magistrate was holding a meeting and tricked me into going out, and then sent soldiers to escort me to repair the city moat." Liu Fulai chimed in, "I fled to the city and couldn't get enough to eat every meal, couldn't sleep peacefully every night, and I was sick. I could barely drink a bowl of water, but you forced me to be a porter, saying that since I could drink water, I wasn't sick." The elderly couple, Liu Qingde and Yang Wu, both 65 years old, walked up to Su Boyin and cried in anger, unable to speak. After a long time, they said, "My old couple brought Quanxi (their 24-year-old son) to the city to escape for our lives, but you insisted on grabbing him to be a porter and had him killed by a cannonball. My old couple only had one son, only one son..." They cried so much that they couldn't continue speaking, and the masses were all clenching their teeth in anger. Su Boyin still tried to evade his crimes, claiming that it was Captain Qin and the county magistrate who assigned the porters, but the masses swore that it was Su himself who forced the assignment. They all said, "Dozens of people have been killed or injured under your command. You can't escape this crime. You turned the Yue Wang Temple into a Yama Temple. You are like Qin Hui. Relief is for the landlords, harming the people, harming the poor. You are a vicious thing. Today we must take revenge! The Eighth Route Army came to save the lives of the poor. We have the truth. We demand that grievances be redressed, revenge be taken, debts be repaid, and murderers pay with their lives." At the meeting, the masses formed a liquidation committee, and the streets are continuing to discuss and coordinate, preparing to continue the struggle for liquidation. (Fu Cang)

　　汤阴恶霸地主苏伯寅
    派款拉夫克扣救济品
    城关三千群众开展总清算
    【本报汤阴讯】五月五日汤阴城关三千余贫苦市民及难民集会，向蒋伪汤阴县救济院院长苏伯寅展开诉苦说理斗争。按苏系汤阴城内十一顷土地的恶霸地主，反攻前任伪县政府民政科员第一区区员（实际掌握区政权，于去年三月又充任蒋伪汤阴县救济院院长。会上，群众对其克扣救济物资，对贫苦人坐视不救，极为愤慨。北关六十五岁的老汉吴庆德控诉苏说：“我房无一间，地无一垅，成天饿着肚，你救济过我多少东西？”全场高呼：没有救过城内和六关一个穷人，我是他苏伯寅的邻家还得不上半点救济呢！旁边一个老太太气恨恨的说：“我去求他姓苏的救救我，他骂我出去，叫我去找县长（伪县长）批准，真不心痛穷人。”全场高呼：打倒汉奸恶霸苏伯寅！接着群众纷纷追问其物资用到何处去了，据苏自供，仅一次即领来五百万元法币，四千袋洋白面，救济了路西地主（包括林县一部地主），洋面三千八百袋，法币四百五十万元，剩余一部分给了城内地主大户。群众证实美式高底皮鞋等都给了大户太太们穿了。保长高喜周揭露苏说：“你不但不救穷人，每次保里派粮款时都得你当家，给穷人多派，没有你的签章不能派，如今你欠工无数，欠粮食三千余斤，都还不是穷人替你出了！”这时群众高呼：反对平均摊派！反对压迫穷人！北关十五岁儿童陈八蚌说：“我六间房子都被孙殿英拆光了，随娘逃到城内岳王庙避难，你苏伯寅说县长开会，把我骗出去派兵押送着去修城壕。”刘福来抢着说：“我逃难到城里，每顿吃不饱，每夜睡不安，身上有了病，刚才能喝碗水，你就硬迫着我当夫子，说我能喝水，就是没病。”六十五岁的刘庆德和杨吴氏老两口，走到苏伯寅跟前，气哭的说不出话来，半天后才说：“我老两口带全喜（二十四岁的儿子）到城里来为逃活命，你偏抓俺当夫，叫炮弹炸死，我老两口只一个儿，只一个儿……”哭的不能往下讲，群众都气得咬牙跺脚。苏伯寅还企图逃避罪恶，连说是秦队长及县长派夫，群众宣誓证实是苏亲自逼派，都说：“在你手下死伤了几十个人，你卸不了这笔罪恶，岳王庙你给变成了阎王庙，你是秦桧一样，救济是救了地主，害老百姓、害穷人，你狠毒的东西，今天我们非报仇不可！八路军来救了穷人命，有了真理，我们要求有冤报冤，有仇报仇，欠债还钱，杀人偿命。”会上群众组成清算委员会，各街正继续酝酿串通，准备继续斗争清算。（复仓）
