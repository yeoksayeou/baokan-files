Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 10th. Since late April to late May, the guerrilla warfare north of the Daqing River in Central Hebei, along the Pinghan and Beining lines, has been extremely active. The traffic between Beiping-Tianjin and Beiping-Baoding has been cut off from time to time. The Chiang Kai-shek army's attempt to invade Yongqing and Shengfang and secure the Beiping-Tianjin-Baoding triangle area in April completely failed. On the night of April 24th, the local armed forces of Daxing County captured the two villages of Zaolin Village and Sigezhuang on the south side of the Beining Line in a surprise attack, capturing 29 members of the puppet militia. The militia in the area disintegrated one after another. Now dozens of villages in Daxing County on the Beining side have been recovered, and reconstruction work is underway, directly threatening the outskirts of Beiping and the traffic between Beiping and Tianjin. On April 29th, a guerrilla unit on the Beining Line annihilated an intelligence squad of the 65th Regiment of the 22nd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army near Langfang, capturing eight people including a captain staff officer. On May 5th, the local armed forces of Jinwu (a newly established county between Tianjin and Wuqing) recovered the two strongholds of Shigezhuang and Yubakou on the south side of Beining in the northwest of Tianjin, allowing our guerrillas to enter and exit the Beining Line more freely. On May 13th, the unit also captured Zhuhegang (west of Wangqingtuo) in western Tianjin, wiping out a squad of the defending enemy and seizing a machine gun and twelve rifles. On the Pinghan front, in early May, a local armed force attacked the railway north of Baoding and once captured Caohe Station, destroying a section of the road. On the 13th, the 121st Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army in Baoding and other units, with four regiments, attacked the XuShui liberated area in the northeast, attempting to "mop up" the area. They were resolutely resisted by the villagers and militiamen of Fanmazhuang and other villages in XuShui County, who annihilated more than 70 of them. On May 17th, a company of Liu Hua's puppet troops from southern Baoding attacked Yingtou Village (more than 30 miles southeast of Baoding), and was mostly annihilated by the local armed forces of Qingyuan County, killing and capturing more than 80 of them, and seizing a machine gun, twenty-six rifles, and twenty war horses. At present, in the vast areas on both sides of the Beining and Pinghan Railways, with the development of guerrilla warfare, the farmers' land reform is also developing vigorously.

    【新华社晋察冀十日电】自四月下旬迄五月下旬，冀中大清河以北，平汉、北宁两线游击战争极为活跃，平津、平保交通时被截断。四月蒋军侵占永清、胜芳及确保平津保三角地区之企图完全失败，四月二十四日夜我大兴县地方武装以奔袭攻克北宁线南侧之枣林村、思各庄两村，俘伪壮丁队二十九名，该地区之壮丁队即纷纷瓦解，现北宁侧大兴县之数十村均告收复，重建工作，直接威胁平郊与平津交通。四月二十九日北宁线某游击队又在廊房附近歼蒋军二十二师六十五团一个情报分队，俘上尉参谋以下八名。五月五日我津武（天津、武清间之新设县）地方武装收复津西北宁南侧之石各庄、鱼坝口两据点，使我游击队更能自由进出北宁线上。五月十三日该部又克津西之渚河港（王庆坨以西），歼守敌一班，缴机枪一挺，步枪十二支。平汉方面五月上旬我某地方武装出击保定以北铁路，一度攻克漕河车站，破路一段。十三日保定蒋军一二一师等部以四个团兵力东北犯徐水解放区，企图“扫荡”该地，遭我徐水县范马庄等村民兵顽强抗击，被歼七十余名，狼狈窜去，我民兵毫无伤亡。五月十七日保定蒋伪刘化南部一个中队出犯营头村（保定东南三十余里），亦遭我清苑县地方武装大部歼灭，毙俘其八十余人，缴机枪一挺，步枪二十六支，战马二十匹。现北宁、平汉铁路两侧广大地区，在游击战争开展下，农民土地改革亦正猛烈开展。
