　　In Yaochang Village, east of Cuiping Mountain, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and special agent landlords committed a horrific massacre by burying people alive.

　　In September of last year, when Chiang's troops occupied Junxian County, the special agent landlords Wang Youliang and Wang Qingzheng followed the Chiang puppet "returning home". They returned to the village and immediately arrested the village's mass leader Wang Gaoshan, along with his son and three grandsons (only his second son was out fighting guerrillas as a militiaman, and his eldest daughter-in-law had returned to her parents' home, fortunately avoiding the disaster). Also arrested were peasant association member Wang Wuniu and his wife and children, a family of five.

　　Three days later, on the night of the fifth day of the ninth lunar month, a fierce northwest wind was blowing. Wang Youliang and a group of "Homecoming Corps" buried Wang Gaoshan and Wang Wuniu's families, a total of ten people, alive in Wang Gaoshan's field west of the village. The next day, they plowed Wang Gaoshan's field again and planted wheat. He announced to the villagers, "Wang Gaoshan is a Communist; his land is confiscated." The villagers gritted their teeth in secret. One night, Wang Yonglian moved a few stones and secretly placed them at the burial site of Wang Gaoshan and the others as a marker.

　　Half a year later, the People's Liberation Army fought its way to northern Henan, and the Chiang Kai-shek troops and their bandits in Junxian County were annihilated. The army and the liberated people came to bury the ten martyrs, including peasant association chairman Wang Gaoshan.

　　Wheat seedlings had already sprouted in Wang Gaoshan's field. In the middle, there was an area of about one square zhang (approximately 3.3 x 3.3 meters) where the wheat seedlings were particularly lush. In the very center of this area were several stones. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the masses of Yaochang Village gathered here. Wang Erguai (Wang Gaoshan's second son) and his sister-in-law were also among the crowd.

　　People began to carefully dig up the bodies of the victims. The corpses of the victims were mixed with the soil. The soldiers and villagers standing around could not help but cry, but Wang Erguai and his sister-in-law did not shed a single tear. On top of the corpses was the wife of peasant association member Wang Wuniu, recognizable by her long hair and bound feet. Her hands were tightly bound behind her back with rope. The second was the third grandson of the old chairman, Wang Gaoshan. The body was completely mixed with the soil, but the mother recognized her child's little red jacket. This mother of the deceased son picked up the fragments of flesh and bone and placed them in the coffin, still without a single tear on her face. The third corpse was her second beloved son, Erjibao, a member of the children's corps. The fourth was her eldest son, Dajibao. Although only thirteen or fourteen years old, he also had a rope tied behind him. The children standing on the side saw the children's corps leader who used to lead them in singing, their eyes widened as they carried the mud-covered corpse into the coffin. The fifth was the unyielding old peasant association chairman – Wang Gaoshan. His sparse beard could still be seen, and he was tightly bound with several ropes. Wang Erguai, seeing his father's tragic death, appeared even more resolute. He pulled the bayonet from the large rifle on his back, cut the ropes binding his father, and placed the corpse in the large cypress coffin prepared for his grandmother. The ninth was Erguai's older brother, Wang Yongtian. Two of his teeth had been knocked out, making it easy to see the tragic scene of his tenacious struggle against the bandits at the time of his death. This widowed woman brought his old clothes and dressed her husband. Ten coffins were lined up in a row. Soldiers, militiamen, and the common people, as well as the children, all came to pay their respects. Firecrackers were set off at the foot of Cuiping Mountain. Wang Erguai, carrying his gun, paid his respects to his father and brother. He declared to everyone: "My father is dead, my brother is dead, my whole family is dead. They died for everyone. I will avenge them and eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and the special agent landlords!" The people of Yaochang Village and the soldiers carried the coffins and buried the ten martyrs in the newly liberated land.

　　安葬
    陈勇进
    在翠屏山东的姚场村，蒋家匪帮和特务地主造下了一桩惨绝人寰的活埋惨案。
    去年九月，蒋军侵占浚县，姚场村的特务地主王友良、王清正跟着蒋伪“还乡”了，他们回到村子就把该村群众领袖王高山和他的一子、三孙一齐扣起来，（只二儿当民兵出去打游击，大儿媳妇回了娘家，幸未遇难）同时被捕的还有农会员王五牛和他的老婆孩子等全家五口人。
    三天以后，在九月初五的夜里，刮着凄厉的西北风，王友良和一伙“还乡团”，把王高山和王五牛两家共十口人活埋在村西王高山的地里。第二天又把王高山这块地犁耕了一遍，种上麦子。他向村里的人宣布说：“王高山是八路，把他的地充公”。村上的人都暗地里咬着牙。一天夜里，王永莲搬了几块石头，偷偷的放在埋着王高山等的地方作记号。
    半年以后，人民解放军打到豫北，浚县蒋军和他的匪徒们被消灭了。军队和解放了的老百姓来为农会长王高山等大小十个死难的人安葬。
    王高山那块地里已经长起麦苗，中间约有一方丈的地方，麦苗特别葱绿，就在这正中间放着几块石头，人民解放军的战士和姚场村的群众都聚集在这里。王二拐（王高山之次子）和他的嫂子也在人群中间。
    人们开始在小心翼翼的挖着被难者的尸体，被难者的尸首和泥土混成一块。站在四周的战士和村子里的人都禁不住的哭起来，但王二拐和他的嫂子都没有一点眼泪。死尸上面是农会员王五牛的老婆，从一把长头发和一对小脚上可以认得她。她的双手被绳子紧捆在背后。第二个是老会长王高山的三孙子，尸体完全和泥土混成一团，母亲还认得孩子的小红袄。这个死去儿子的母亲，将肉泥残骨一块拾到棺材里，脸上仍然没有一滴眼泪。第三个尸首，是她的第二个爱子二冀保，他是儿童团员。第四个是她的大儿子大冀保。虽然才十三四岁，背后也有一条绳子捆着。站在一边的孩子们看见过去领导他们唱歌的儿童团长，眼瞪大起来，把带泥的尸体搬到棺材里。第五个就是不屈的老农会长——王高山。还可以看到他嘴上稀疏的胡子，他被几条绳子紧紧捆着。王二拐看见惨死的父亲，显得更加刚毅了，他从自己背上那支大盖枪上拔下刺刀，割断捆着父亲的绳子，把尸首放进为他祖母准备下的大柏木板棺材里。第九个是一拐的哥哥王永田，他的牙齿被打落了两个，这不难看出他遇难时与匪帮们顽强斗争的悲壮情景。这个孤寡的女人，拿来他往日的衣服给丈夫穿上。十口棺材并排成一行。军队民兵和老百姓以及孩子们都来祭奠他们，翠屏山下点起了鞭炮，王二拐背着他的枪，祭奠过他的父亲和哥哥，他向大家宣誓：“我父亲死啦，我哥哥死啦，我一家人都死啦，他们是为大家死的，我要为他们报仇，消灭蒋介石和特务地主！”姚场村的人和战士们抬着棺材，把十个死难者安葬在重获解放的新土地上。
