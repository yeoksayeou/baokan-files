　　Increasing Income and Ensuring Supply
    The Sixth Administrative Office of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Commended for Financial Work
    [This newspaper, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 30th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office recently issued a circular commending the financial work of the Sixth Administrative Office. In the past six months, the financial work of the Administrative Office has made new discoveries and creations in the task of supporting the front lines of the War of Self-Defense. Its leadership methods and style have provided direction for financial work in various regions. The commendation order listed its achievements as follows: (1) From helping the masses in production to solving the supply of military cloth and military shoes, the cost to the masses for one jin of rice can weave one square foot of cloth, but we give the masses two jin of rice. The cost to the masses for fifteen jin of rice can make a pair of shoes, and we give the masses twenty-five jin of rice. Then, we let the masses hand over cloth and shoes, using the public grain that the masses should contribute to give to the masses, so that the masses can profit from it. Therefore, the masses are vying to weave cloth and make shoes. As a result, seven million square feet of cloth were received in one month and 110,000 pairs of shoes were received in half a year. The masses profited seven million jin of rice from cloth and one million jin of rice from shoes. In this way, taking the mass line is not only saving a lot of manpower compared to buying cloth and shoes with grain in the past, but also ensuring timely supply, increasing the income of the masses, and improving the production enthusiasm of the masses. (2) Several repeated inspections have been carried out in the past six months, and the actual grain has been accurately grasped, ensuring the supply of the army. In repeated inspections, a relatively accurate amount of grain was obtained, overcoming the subjective method of grasping numbers only from the books. In clearing up the "buried grain," the ideological opposition between the departments in charge of financial rice and the departments that spend financial rice has been gradually resolved, overcoming the shortcomings of the past in which the system was first restricted from a negative perspective. (3) Starting with actively organizing income, after the transaction tax and liquor tax were reorganized, income increased by one time, and deed tax income exceeded two or three times. As a result, three-quarters of the total task for the first half of the year was completed in three months (converted into rice), overcoming the passive phenomenon of not conducting in-depth inspections in the past, and becoming an in-depth approach to discovering problems at the grassroots level, and actively organizing income beyond the task.

　　增加收入保证供给
    冀鲁豫六专署财政工作获表扬
    【本报冀鲁豫卅日电】冀鲁豫行署顷通令表扬六专署财政工作。该专署财政工作，半年来在自卫战争支援前线任务中，获得新的发现与创造，其领导方法与作风，给各地财政工作指示了方向。表扬令列举其成绩称：（一）从帮助群众生产达到解决军布军鞋的供给，群众一斤米的成本，可以织出一方尺布，但我们用二斤米给群众。群众以十五斤米的成本，可以做一双鞋，我们以二十五斤米给群众，然后让群众交布交鞋，以群众应出之公粮拨给群众，群众又能从中取利，因之群众都争着织布做鞋，结果在一个月内收到七百万方尺布，在半年内收到十一万双鞋，群众以布获利七百万斤米，以鞋获利一百万斤米，像这样走群众路线，较之过去卖粮买布买鞋，不但大大的节省了人力，也及时的保证了供给，增加了群众收入，提高了群众的生产情绪。（二）半年来做过几次的反复检查，确实掌握了现粮，保证了军队的供给，在反复检查中，得到比较确实的粮食数目，克服了单从账木上掌握数目字的主观主义的方法。在清理埋伏中，逐步的解决了掌握财米部门与开支财米部门思想上的对立状态，克服了过去在制度上先从消极方面限制的缺点。（三）从积极组织收入着手，交易税酒税整理后，增加收入一倍，契税收入超过二、三倍，因之三个月内完成上半年的总任务的四分之三（折成米计算），克服了过去被动的不深入检查的现象，而变为深入下层发现问题，积极组织收入超过任务的作风。
