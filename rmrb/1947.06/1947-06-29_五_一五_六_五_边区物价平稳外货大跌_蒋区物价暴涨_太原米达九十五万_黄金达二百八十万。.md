    Border Region Prices Stable, Foreign Goods Plummet
    Chiang-Controlled Areas See Soaring Prices; Taiyuan Rice Reaches 950,000, Gold Reaches 2,800,000.
    [This Newspaper] In the past two weeks, prices of local products in our border region have generally been stable, with cotton and mountain goods increasing in price, and foreign goods plummeting. Conversely, prices in Chiang-controlled areas have soared. The situation in Tianjin has seen a temporary decline. Details are as follows:
    Grain: Nangong has the highest prices, while Changzhi in western Taihang and Anze and Hecuan in the first district of Taiyue have the lowest. In the Taiyue area: grain prices in Yangcheng and Jincheng rose as goods moved east, but after adjustments, prices fell by 10-15 yuan in one day on the 6th. Millet: Jiyuan 62.5 yuan, Yangcheng 56.25 yuan, Jincheng 50 yuan, Hecuan 37.5 yuan. Wheat: Jiyuan 77.4 yuan, Yangcheng 52.8 yuan, Hecuan 73 yuan. In the Taihang area: with the busy farming season and the arrival of new wheat on the market, rice generally rose slightly, and wheat fell slightly. Millet: Yangyi 90 yuan, Zanhuang 87.5 yuan, Changzhi fell to 48 yuan. Wheat: Yangyi 109 yuan, Wu'an 115 yuan, Changzhi 70 yuan. Prices are higher on the Pinghan Line and in southern Hebei due to the busy farming season and grain shortages, as well as the influence of central Hebei. Rice is 94.5-125 yuan, with Nangong being the highest, Handan the second highest, and Xingtai the lowest. Wheat is 97-130 yuan, with Handan, Gao, and Xingtai being low. Linqing is stable and falling, with millet at 89 yuan and wheat at 101 yuan. In the Chiang-controlled areas, the Bing Municipality and Yan Xishan stubbornly ordered that anyone entering the city must bring half a year's worth of grain, and they also plundered civilian grain under the guise of city defense grain, fundraising grain, and war preparation grain. The masses are panicked, the city is chaotic, and prices are soaring daily, changing several times a day. From the 11th to the 14th, rice rose from 175,000 to 240,000 yuan, and wheat rose from 290,000 to 420,000 yuan. On the 24th, in one day, millet rose from 640,000 to 950,000 yuan, wheat rose from 620,000 to 820,000 yuan, and gold reached 2,800,000 yuan. Tianjin and Jinan tightened their currencies, and with the approaching Dragon Boat Festival, merchants settled accounts, and money was tight, leading to price suppression. At the same time, the Beining Railway was cut off, and merchants waited and watched, causing prices to temporarily fall, but given the scarcity of materials, prices will soon rebound sharply. Jinan is experiencing a coal shortage, previously burning soybeans, and now burning sweet potato stalks, causing the power to be cut off. Coal prices have already begun to soar, with coal blocks rising from 1450 to 1600 yuan at the end of the month. On the 22nd, millet rose from 2100 at the beginning of the ten-day period to 2700 yuan, and wheat rose from 2000 to 2870 yuan. By the 29th, wheat had fallen to 1900 yuan. On the 6th, the price of rice in Tianjin was 2450 yuan, and wheat was 2800 yuan.
    Cotton: High prices in the Chiang-controlled areas are driving up smuggling prices in the border region. Local cloth is in oversupply and prices are stable – slightly rising in individual areas. Jiyuan Miaojie 5000 yuan per bolt, up 16%. Cotton: Taiyue cotton is sold to Xi'an and Luoyang, and southern Hebei is sold to Jinan. Prices throughout the region are between 430-900 yuan, with Jiyuan Miaojie being the highest, followed by Changzhi Linqing, with prices between 530-550 yuan, and Handan being the lowest. The Chiang-controlled areas tightened their currencies, suppressing prices. Jinan fell to 800,000 yuan (per 100 jin), and Luoyang fell to 1,000,000 yuan (per 100 jin). Local cloth (per bolt) rose from 3000 yuan on the 17th to 4800 yuan by the 27th.
    Foreign Goods: Due to the increase in our currency value and the fall of Chiang's currency, our needed foreign goods are flowing in, and Taiyue has also captured the salt ponds of Yuncheng, so the price of foreign goods has plummeted. It started in Linqing. In the two weeks, Nanjing matches (per basket) fell by 4000 yuan in Linqing and 8000 yuan in Handan. From the beginning of the middle ten days in Nangong to the 5th, the price per package fell by 100 yuan in half a month. As of the 5th, the price throughout the region was between 56,500-66,000 yuan, with Yangyi being higher and Linqing being the lowest. Quick indigo fell by 15,000 yuan in Linqing and 10,000 yuan in Handan.
    Mountain Goods: Raw silk sold to Luoyang has risen in price, with a difference of 9500 yuan (per four jin) in Jiyuan Miaojie. Xingtai has resident buyers, and prices have not risen at the end of the month. Old hemp rose from 205 to 230 yuan, and peach kernels rose from 240 to 280 yuan. In the Chiang-controlled area of Luoyang, raw silk rose by 65,000 yuan (per 14.8 taels) on the 27th, up 16.7%. White oil in Jinan fell to 5600 yuan.
    In the past two weeks, prices in the Chiang-controlled areas have fluctuated, but the black market prices are higher than the market prices. For example, in Luoyang on the 19th, gold was 850,000 yuan, but the black market price was 1,200,000 yuan, which proves the high prices in the black market.

　　五·一五——六·五
    边区物价平稳外货大跌
    蒋区物价暴涨  太原米达九十五万  黄金达二百八十万。
    【本报讯】两旬来本边区物价土产品一般平稳，棉花山货价提，外货大跌。反之，蒋区物价暴涨不已，津市一度下跌，简情如次：
    粮食：南宫最高，太行西部长治一带与太岳一分区安泽和川米最低。太岳方面：阳（城）、晋（城）粮东走价升，后经调剂，六日一天价落一○——一五元。小米：济（源）六二·五元，阳（城）五六·二五元，晋（城）五○元，和（川）三七·五元。小麦：济（源）七七·四元，阳（城）五二·八元，和（川）七三元。太行方面：农忙新麦上市，一般米微升，麦微跌。小米：阳邑九○元，赞皇八七·五元，长治跌为四八元。小麦：阳邑一○九元，武安一一五元，长治七○元，平汉线与冀南农忙粮短，又受冀中之影响价较高，米为九四·五——一二五元，南（宫）高、邯（郸）次之，邢（台）最低，小麦九七——一三○元，邯（郸）、高、邢（台）低，临清平稳跌下，小米八九元，小麦一○一元。蒋区并市阎顽勒令各地无论何人必需带半年粮方准进城，又以护城粮、募捐粮、备战粮等名义掠夺民粮，群众恐慌，市容混乱，物价连日暴涨，一日数变，并十一日至十四日米由一七·五万涨为二四万元，小麦由二九万涨为四二万元，二十四日一天内，小米由六四万涨为九五万元，小麦由六二万涨为八二万元，黄金二八○万元。津济紧缩通货，端阳节又临，商人结帐，银根吃紧，压价，同时北宁路被切断，以及商人观望等物价暂跌，按其物资匮乏，物价不久即复暴涨。济市煤荒，前烧大豆，现烧地瓜杆，致电灯停开，煤价已开始暴涨，月末煤块由一四五○涨为一六○○元。二十二日小米由旬初之二一○○涨为二七○○元，小麦由二○○○涨为二八七○元，迄二十九日，小麦跌为一九○○元。津市六日米价为二四五○元，小麦为二八○○元。
    棉花：蒋区价高，影响边区走私价提，土布供过于求价稳——个别地区稍升。济（源）庙街每匹五○○○元，涨百分之十六。棉花：太岳棉分销西（安）、洛（阳），冀南销济（南），全区价在四三○——九○○元，济（源）庙街最高，长治临清次之，价在五三○——五五○元，邯（郸）最低。蒋区紧缩通货，压价，济跌为八○万元（百斤），洛跌为一○○万元（百斤），土布（匹）迄二十七日由十七日之三○○○元涨为四八○○元。
    外货：由于本位币提高，蒋币下跌，我必需的外货源源输进，太岳又克运城之盐池，因之外货价格顿形大跌，首由临（清）开始，两旬间南京火柴（篓）临（清）跌四○○○元，邯（郸）跌八○○○元，南（宫）中旬初起五日止，半月间每包跌一○○元。五日止，全区价在五六五○○——六六○○○元，阳（邑）较高，临清最低。快靛临（清）跌差一五○○○元，邯（郸）跌差一○○○○元。
    山货：生丝输洛（阳）价升，济（源）庙街差额九五○○元（四斤）。邢台住有客收，下旬未升。老麻由二○五升二三○元，桃仁由二四○升二八○元。蒋区洛（阳）二十七日生丝升六五○○○元（十四两八钱秤），涨百分之一六·七。济（南）白油跌为五六○○元。
    两旬来蒋区物价虽有涨有跌，但其黑市却高出市场价，如洛（阳）十九日黄金八五万元，黑市价却为一二○万元，由此可证明物价黑市之高。
