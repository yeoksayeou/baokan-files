The officers and soldiers of this division, intimidated by the People's Liberation Army's divine power to annihilate its top main force, deserted along the way. According to Zhang Guiquan and Zhao Wenxiang, soldiers of the horse-drawn carriage platoon and the conscript escort platoon of the 156th Regiment of the 52nd Brigade who fled to the Subei Liberated Area: The 52nd Brigade departed southwest from the starting point of the Haizhou Longhai Railway. The officers falsely claimed that they were going to the city to take over the defense for rest and reorganization. The next day, however, they marched northwest, getting farther and farther away, and everyone understood that they were going to Shandong to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek. That night, when they camped in Fanpu, 60 of the 170 soldiers in the entire company deserted. Desertions from the 192nd Brigade of the division were also severe, with 20 soldiers deserting overnight from the 96-man 3rd Company of the 574th Regiment alone. According to deserters like Wang Chunqing, many of them were conscripted from Hefei, Anhui, and were shedding tears in secret. The closer they got to the front line, the more desertions there were.
