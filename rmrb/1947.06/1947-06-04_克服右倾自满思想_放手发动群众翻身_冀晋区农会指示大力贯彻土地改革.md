Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 31st: The Hebei-Shanxi District Farmers' Association issued instructions a few days ago to implement land reform. The instructions first pointed out that land reform in the Hebei-Shanxi District was not thorough enough, and most areas were only "half-cooked." Therefore, it proposed: 1. Leaders at all levels must conduct further, in-depth, and comprehensive mobilization. All comrades must have sufficient understanding of the serious incompleteness of land reform and the extreme necessity of further in-depth implementation. Universally reflect on and expose right-leaning thoughts and the right-leaning mistakes committed. Thoroughly clear ideological obstacles, overcome "complacency" and "overestimation," and unify the understanding that land reform is only a preliminary implementation and has not been fundamentally completed, and must be carried out comprehensively and with full effort. 2. Fully implement the mass line, boldly promote democracy, and absolutely overcome and prohibit the paternalistic, substitutive, coercive, commanding, and beneficent viewpoints of acting without democracy and being divorced from the masses. All struggles, who to struggle against, to what extent to struggle? What methods to use to take care of people? Who to take care of? What to take care of? How much to take care of? What to distribute? (Who to distribute to?) How much to distribute? All must be decided through the mass line, through the full democratic discussion and public decision of 90% of the masses. No individual or small number of people can act arbitrarily. Leadership only has the obligation to persuade and educate the masses to consciously and voluntarily master and apply the policy of taking care of all kinds of people; there is no power to force the masses to take care of others. Ninety percent of the people can revise our policies, but we cannot revise the demands of 90% of the masses. In the in-depth implementation of land reform, the role of the Farmers' Association must be fully utilized. Chairman Mao's instructions to "do everything through the Farmers' Association" and "all power belongs to the Farmers' Association" must be conscientiously implemented. With the consent of 90% of the masses, all levels can universally convene peasant representative conferences and village-level peasant conferences, allowing peasants to truly be their own masters, discuss and decide all their own problems, and elect their own leaders. Only with this kind of full democracy and thorough mass line can the masses' hearts be truly turned over, the masses can be truly mobilized, grievances can be fully aired, the sense of being masters of their own affairs can be established, and land demands can be satisfied. Only then can the Farmers' Association organization have strength; the masses' enthusiasm for production, joining the army, and participating in the war can be greatly increased; feudal exploitation can be thoroughly eliminated; the landlords' air-raid shelters can be completely dug out; the selfish and undemocratic practices of individual cadres can be rendered impossible; and work related to security, armaments, and cooperation can have a stronger foundation, relations between the military and the people and between cadres and the masses can be more united, and a completely new situation can emerge in all work. Therefore, a thorough mass line and the bold mobilization of the masses is the key to whether land reform can be done thoroughly; it is also the turning point in the transformation of all work. 3. Thoroughly overcome the idea that production and land reform are contradictory. Many comrades believe that land reform cannot be carried out during production time, and that doing so will inevitably affect production. Therefore, the conclusion is that land reform can only be carried out in the slack agricultural seasons of autumn and winter. This understanding is extremely one-sided and shortsighted. It only calculates from the simple and mechanical perspective that "land reform requires meetings, and one day of meetings delays one day of production," without fundamentally understanding: What is land reform for? If peasants do not have land, or if there are unresolved problems with the land, will production enthusiasm be high? How much production will be delayed and affected if this is not done for a long time? Therefore, what is delaying and affecting production is not land reform, but precisely "the lack of land reform" and the failure to resolve problems with the land. As leaders, we should not only passively avoid delaying or affecting the masses' production, but more importantly, we should try our best to improve the masses' production. Land reform is one of the most important and best ways to improve the masses' production. As for the integration of land reform with production, such as the methods of "working during the day and dividing land at night" in Wutai, and the "combination of heart-to-heart talks and grievance sessions at the field with labor allocation groups" in Dingxiang, are all very good. Everyone should learn from them. In short, land reform eliminates feudalism, which is currently the most central task in all non-war areas. Regardless of new, old, or border areas, all work must be carried out around land reform. Any excuse to postpone or delay is wrong.

　　克服右倾自满思想  放手发动群众翻身
　　冀晋区农会指示大力贯彻土地改革
    【新华社晋察冀三十一日电】冀晋区农会为贯彻土地改革，特于日前发出指示，该指示首先指出：冀晋区土地改革很不深入，大部地方“半生不熟”。因此提出：一、各级领导必须再作深入普遍的充分动员，全体同志要足够的认识土地改革严重的不彻底性和再深入贯彻的十分必要性。普遍反省揭发右倾思想及所犯的右倾错误。彻底打通思想，克服“自满”和“过高估计”，统一认识土地改革只是初步贯彻，并未基本完成，尚须全面全力进行。二、充分贯彻群众路线，放手发扬民主，绝对克服和禁止没有民主脱离群众的包办、代替、强迫、命令和恩赐观点。一切斗争，斗争谁、斗到什么程度？用什么办法照顾？照顾谁？照顾什么？照顾多少？分配什么？（分给谁）？分多少？均必须通过群众路线，由百分之九十群众充分的民主讨论，大家公决。任何个人或少数人，不能独断专行。领导上只有把应照顾各色人等的照顾政策，去说服、教育群众自觉自愿掌握运用的义务，没有强制群众去照顾别人的任何权力。百分之九十人民可以修改我们的政策，而我们不能修改百分之九十群众的要求。在深入贯彻土地改革中，必须充分发挥农会的作用。毛主席“一切通过农会”，“一切权力归农会”的指示，要认真的贯彻。在百分之九十群众要求同意下，各级可普遍的召开农民代表大会，村级农民大会，让农民真正的自己作主，讨论决定自己的一切问题，选举自己的领袖。只有这种充分的民主，彻底的群众路线，群众的心才能真正翻透，群众才能真正发动，苦水才能倒尽，主人公思想才能树立，土地要求才能满足。农会组织才能有力量；群众的生产、参军、参战的积极性才能大大提高，封建剥削才能彻底消灭，地主们的防空洞才能彻底挖掉，个别少数干部的自私自肥、不民主作风才能成为不可能；治安、武装、合作等工作才能更有基础，军民上下、干群之间的关系才能更团结，一切工作才能出现一崭新的局面。因此，彻底的群众路线，放手的发动起群众，是土地改革能否彻底作好的关键；也是一切工作转变的转折点。三、彻底克服生产与土地改革对立的思想。许多同志认为生产时间不能进行土地改革，要进行必然要影响生产。因此，结论是土地改革只能在农闲的秋冬去搞。这种认识是极其片面、近视的。只是单纯机械的从“土地改革要开会，开一天会就耽误一天生产”的时间上计算，没有从根本上认识到：土地改革究竟是为什么？农民没有土地、或土地上有问题不解决，生产情绪是否会高？长此不搞该耽误影响多少生产？因此，说耽误影响生产的，不是土地改革而正是“土地不改革，”和土地上有问题不解决，我们一个领导者，不只是消极的不耽误、不影响群众生产，更重要的是想尽一切办法去提高群众的生产。土地改革就是提高群众的生产最主要最好的办法之一。至于土地改革注意与生产结合，像五台的“白天闹生产，晚上分土地”，定襄的“地头谈心诉苦组与拨工组相结合”的办法，都是很好的。大家应该学习。总之，土地改革消灭封建，这是目前一切非战争地区的最中心的工作。不论新、老边沿区，一切工作都要围绕土地改革去进行。任何借口推托迟延都是不对的。
