Shi Zhenming's Method for Saving Seedlings

    Shi Zhenming's mutual aid team chops last year's corn stalks or sorghum stalks into short sections of three or five inches with a铡knife (a straw cutter). Then, soak them in water (the water should be two or three inches higher than the corn stalks) for one or two days until they are saturated. When the corn stalks are very soft and can no longer absorb water, take them out of the water and quickly dig small trenches around the seedlings, one or two inches away, two to two and a half inches deep, but no more than three inches, and not too shallow. After the small trenches are dug, while they are still wet, put the soaked corn stalks into them, preferably one section connected to another, surrounding the seedlings, and then bury them with soil and tamp them down firmly. Using this method, the seedlings will not be greatly affected by drought. However, be careful not to damage the fine roots of the seedlings when digging the small trenches. No matter what kind of autumn seedlings, doing this can keep them from dying for at least two months.

    In some areas that are not near a river, you can carry water and soak the stalks in large basins and water tanks.

　　石振明救苗办法
    石振明联合互助大队，把去年的玉茭秆子或高粱秆子，用铡刀切成三寸或五寸不等的短圪节。再把它泡在水里（水应比泡进去的玉茭秆高出二、三寸）浸一、二日，浸透，待玉茭秆泡的非常软，再也不能吸收水分的时候，就把秆子从水里捞起来，赶紧把苗子周围一、二寸的地方挖成小沟，深二寸到二寸半，最多不超过三寸，可也不敢太浅。小沟挖好后，趁湿把浸透的玉茭秆子放进去，最好是一圪节接一圪节的围起来，然后用土淹埋好，踏实。采用这种办法，天旱苗子也不受多大害。但在挖小沟时，要注意不要损伤了苗子的毛根。不管什么秋苗，这样做了，至少可以保持两个多月不枯死。
    有些地区不靠河，可以担水在大盆和水缸里泡都行。
