　　Border Region Farm Sells Insecticides and Insecticide Sprayers in Large Quantities
    [Our Newspaper] Due to a prolonged drought, insect plagues have become widespread. To assist various regions in vigorously eliminating insect pests and protecting crops, the Border Region Farm is selling sprayers (insecticide application tools) and various insecticides in large quantities. The sprayers are most effective in killing cotton seedling aphids; with sufficient prepared tobacco stalk water, one person can spray and kill aphids on five to six mu of cotton seedlings per day. The price is very cheap, only 10,000 yuan each.
