(Report from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan office on the 19th) In the re-examination work in various parts of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, the consciousness of backward peasants has been raised, and they have offered up the hidden wealth of landlords. In Handian, the eighth district of Boping, it was discovered during the re-examination that many farmers were hiding things for landlords. A general meeting of all farmers' association members was held to call on them to offer up the hidden wealth and enlighten everyone's class consciousness, saying, "Letting the landlords put things is destroying the unity of us farmers. The landlords sew their packages tightly with double threads, fearing that someone will steal them, which is an insult to the poor." It was also explained that there would be rewards for those who voluntarily offered them up. As a result, 17 farmers' association members offered up things stored by landlords. In the re-examination in the East Street of Chengguan, not a single piece of concealed wealth of the landlord Liu Weifan was found. Therefore, it was decided to call on people at the general meeting to report those who had stored things for Liu Weifan. As a result, 21 households (out of more than 70 households in the whole village) reported all the things they had stored for the landlord, even things stored by landlords from other villages. In the Wan Yu farmers' conference in the fifth district of Puyang, the discussion focused on comparing the farmers with the landlords and by thinking the masses came to understand that the landlord's power had not been completely eliminated and that the landlord still had a lot of floating wealth. It was proposed that in order to thoroughly investigate the landlords, it was necessary to clean up the organization from within. Many of us have landlord's "safes" inside storing things for the landlords. The conference immediately deliberated on what to do with the landlord's "safes". Finally, it was proposed that whoever stored things for the landlord was temporarily threatened and deceived by the landlord, and it would be fine to report it; it was also explained that the landlord's act of storing things in someone's home was like killing people without seeing blood. More than a dozen farmers' association members in Wuxingji confessed. The leadership called on the "safes" to open themselves, and we wanted to separate from the landlords. Those who reported the things were good members of the farmers' association. As a result, a lot of big packages, livestock, vehicles, clothes, cloth, and 500,000 yuan in legal tender were reported. Through self-reporting, the masses became more aware that the landlords were still hiding a lot of good things, and it was necessary to thoroughly investigate them.

　　发动“落后”层  打开“保险柜”
    冀鲁豫深入搜查封建
    【本报冀鲁豫十九日电】冀鲁豫各地在复查中，落后农民觉悟提高，纷纷献出隐藏地主的浮财。博平八区还店，在复查中发觉有很多农民替地主掩藏东西，便在全体农会会员大会上号召献出隐藏的浮财，并启发大家的阶级觉悟说：“给地主放东西是破坏咱农民的团结，地主们放的包袱都用双线密密缝几道，这是怕偷他的，是污辱穷人。”并说明自献的有赏，结果有十七家农会员献出地主存放的东西。城关东街在这次复查中，未查出地主刘为凡一点浮财，于是决定在大会上号召把存放刘为凡东西的自报出来，结果有二十一户（全村共七十多户）把给地主存放的东西都报出来，连外庄地主放的东西也自报出来了。濮阳五区在全区万余农民大会上讨论复查，由农民和地主比一比想一想中，了解地主势力还没有彻底消灭，地主还有很多浮财，有人提出要想彻底清查地主，非先清理咱们内部不可。咱们内部有好多地主的“保险柜”给地主放着东西。大会立即酝酿对地主的“保险柜”怎么办？最后提出谁存地主的东西，一时受地主的威胁欺骗，报出来没事；又说明地主往谁家存东西就是杀人不见血。五星集有十多个农会员都自报了，领导上又号召“保险柜”自己去开，我们要和地主分家，报出东西的是好农会员，结果报出很多大包袱、牲口、车辆、衣服、布匹等及五十万法币，经过自报，群众更加认识了地主还隐藏很多好东西，非彻底清查不可。
