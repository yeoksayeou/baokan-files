　　Masses in Various Regions Welcome "July 1st" with Widespread Merit-Praising Campaigns
　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The "July 1st" merit-establishment campaign has penetrated deeply among the masses and is being rolled out universally. When the masses in Sihe Township, She County, held a meeting, they compared the facts of their village with the old society. When searching for benefactors and merits, everyone first gave credit to Chairman Mao, saying that Chairman Mao's merits were the greatest, and without Chairman Mao's leadership, there would be no good times of liberation today. When the masses in Yangjiashan talked about merits, they all found their most outstanding points. Yang Erhai said: "That year, I went to Henan Dian to go to the market and met a sick soldier on the road. I sent him to Jiangjiazhuang Xiahe before daring to go home in the dark." Yang Cailin said: "That year, everyone had to pay a burden, and I shouldn't have had to pay. I didn't calculate it properly and felt that it wasn't right, so I voluntarily took on two extra shares of the burden at the meeting." In this way, more than 30 people in Sanjie declared their merits in one night. This movement covered a wide area, and women also participated enthusiastically, almost all of them establishing merits. Tinghepu in Licheng held an early memorial meeting for July 1st on the 17th of this month, summarizing their work and carrying out merit-establishment, and after evaluation and discussion, 39 people established merits. Wang Jicheng worked hard and led actively, helping women hold family meetings to study how to save three liang of rice every day, and also taking time to pick three jin of wild vegetables. Wang Liansheng led deep plowing and meticulous cultivation and the combination of agricultural and sideline production with war support, all of which established great merits. After the establishment of the Merit-Establishment Committee in the Third District of Shahe, the district chief and secretary first formulated a plan, personally participating in mutual aid groups to become a model, frequently understanding the reflections and demands of the masses, and leading the masses of the district to fight against the drought. Then the cadres also formulated plans, and all the cadres in the district guaranteed that they would no longer smoke. Three pipes were smashed on the spot.

　　各地群众迎接“七一”普遍开展表功运动
    【本报讯】“七一”立功运动，已深入群众普遍展开，涉县四合乡群众在开会时，以自己村里的事实对比了旧社会，找恩人和功劳时，大家首先给毛主席立了功，都说数毛主席的功劳大，没有毛主席的领导就不会有今天的翻身好时光。杨家山群众在谈功时都找出自己最突出的一点，杨二孩说：“那年我去河南店赶集回来，在路上遇到一个有病的军队，我送到他江家庄下河才搭黑回家”。杨彩林说：“那年都出负担我不该出，计算不上，自己感到不行，在大会上自愿领了二分负担。”这样三街一夜就有三十多人表功。这次运动面积宽，妇女也都踊跃参加，差不多都立了功。”黎城停河铺本月十七日提前召开纪念七一大会，总结工作开展立功，评选讨论后，有三十九名立了功。王记成工作吃苦领导积极，帮助妇女开家庭会议，研究节约每天省米三两，还要抽时间采野菜三斤。王连升领导深耕细作和农副战勤三结合，都立了大功。沙河三区立功委员会成立后，区长分书，首先订出计划，要亲自参加互助组搞成模范，经常了解群众的反映和要求，并领导全区群众和旱灾作斗争，接着干部们也都订出计划，全区干部并保证不再吸烟。当场就打毁了三个烟袋。（崇智、乃顺、俊田、锐文、全有、全仁）
