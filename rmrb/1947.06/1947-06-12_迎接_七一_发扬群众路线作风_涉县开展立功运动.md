　　Welcoming "July 1st" and Promoting the Mass Line Style
    Shexian County Launches Emulation Drive
    Launch an Emulation Drive
    Promote Production and Prepare for Famine
    [This newspaper's Shexian dispatch] In order to welcome "July 1st," offer birthday wishes to the Party, and further promote production and famine preparedness, Shexian County has launched an emulation drive. On the 27th of last month, the Fifth District convened a conference of 414 district and village cadres, activists, (male and female) teachers, and various models of participation in war, grain transport, production, and famine preparedness. Through small-scale discussions and large-scale forums, everyone found ways to follow the mass line in the busy work of production and war support over the past month. Many model examples were brought up during the discussions. Chang Anle, a model cadre from Huangyan Village, discovered that bad elements were spreading rumors in his village during grain transport. He first mobilized the masses for discussions, summarized the grain transport work, and selected 40 models. Through commendation and encouragement, the masses' awareness was raised, and the activities of the bad elements were clarified as the masses became aware. Feng Qitai mentioned that Feng Linxi made destructive remarks on the road, inciting him to exchange animals for a better life, and provoking the return of fruits. This sparked a mass anti-sabotage movement. Then, with the models as the backbone, the call to complete transport early and plant the land early was put forward. When the third grain transport came, people competed to deliver it. When Yang Jingquan of Linwang Village received the grain transport task, he first thought of the leading role of the cadres. In the grain loading, he first mobilized the cadres and set an example himself, mobilizing all the cadres to compete to load the grain, influencing all the old men, children, and semi-able-bodied people in the village to compete as well, completing the task in two trips.
