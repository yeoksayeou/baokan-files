Seize the Opportunity to Organize All and Semi-able-bodied Labor Force
    Rush to Plant When it Rains
    Qi Zhi County Cadres Set Off Day and Night to Lead in Various Districts
    [Our Newspaper] After rains fell in various parts of Southern Hebei on the third and fourth, each county immediately rushed to plant. On the third, Qi Zhi County had widespread rain. On the morning of the fourth, it was learned from the cadres sitting in the district counties on the phone that the rainfall in each district was two or three fingers [about 2-3 cm], barely enough for planting, but the masses were still hesitant. The county party committee immediately convened an enlarged meeting of section chiefs and above at the county level to arrange for rushing to plant, and determined that all county-level organs, except for a few people to support the work, County Secretary Feng, County Chief Wang, Construction Section Chief Yuan, Armed Committee Director Shen, Comrade Chu Chaoming of the County Committee, Secretary Wang of the County Government, Civil Affairs Section Chief He, and others, sixteen people in total, immediately rushed to various districts day and night to promote replanting and rushing to plant. County Chief Wang rushed to the Second District and immediately called on the district cadres to lead by example, helping the masses pull the plows and rollers, striving to complete the rushing to plant in three days. Two thousand eight hundred and sixty-three people in the Second District were quickly organized, and under the personal leadership of County Chief Wang, they actively rushed to plant. In Lu Village, they were still planting in the evening, and the sound of the rollers could still be heard until midnight. After three major assaults, the entire district rushed to plant a total of 83,613 mu; especially in the East Sub-district, a total of 179 long-term mutual aid teams and 232 temporary mutual aid teams were organized, with 2,028 people pouring into the fields, rushing to plant a total of 31,600 mu. On the fourth, Yongnian welcomed widespread rain, about two or three fingers deep. The leadership promoted the masses to rush to plant while rushing to harvest, because the rainfall was not heavy. At first, the masses expressed hesitation. After the cadres took the lead in helping and persuading, a wave of rushing to plant was set off in various villages. County Secretary Li Xin personally went to Shiguanying to lead and help the masses rush to plant, boosting everyone's morale, and planted ten qing of late seedlings on rainy days. Dongcheng Gu in the Second District rushed to plant fifteen qing in one day, and men, women, and children in Guo Village all pitched in, rushing to plant six qing in one day.
    [Our Newspaper, Southern Hebei, 24th Dispatch] Since heavy rain fell in Gaotang at the end of last month, the entire county completed rushing to plant within three to five days. In Erxiao Mazhuang, men and women, old and young, were fully mobilized to rush to plant. Male laborers concentrated livestock for plowing and sowing. If there were not enough livestock, they were replaced by human pulling. Children picked wild vegetables, and women cooperated with men to sow and plant. Carpenters and workers took furniture, and immediately repaired broken plows and rollers. After three major plantings, 330 mu were completed. In Wang Village in the Fourth District, men and women were all mobilized, creating a "sweep-all" assault method. Men plowed, planted, and hoed, while women and children collected wild vegetables for famine relief and weeded. According to statistics from the entire district, 9,885 mu have been planted, 4,781 mu have been cultivated, 11,037 mu of land have been hoed, and more than 6,500 jin of thorn vegetables have been dug, and the wild vegetables are dried for famine relief. The masses in Da Dong Village in the Fourth District also struggled against the landlords Dong Shulan and Zhang Jida during the rushing to plant. The villagers of Pengjia Village discussed how to divide the fruits during the break from rushing to plant; Ni Guantun struggled against the landlords while rushing to plant.
    [Our Newspaper, Zuoquan Dispatch] At 2:30 PM on the 13th of this month, a heavy rain fell in the Aiyukou area of the Third District, and after about half an hour of rain, Comrade Zhang Tong, the village chief of Dong Aiyukou Village, and Comrade Huangfu @, the political director, immediately actively led the members of the production technology research committee to the ground to actually follow the verification, all falling more than two fingers of rain. He immediately led the men and women of the whole village to rush to plant. The village has a total of 234 mu of unplanted valley land and hemp land. The village has a total of 28 livestock. Each person can plant more than three mu every day, and 80 mu can be planted in one day. It will be enough to plant in three days. In order to save time, everyone decided to not rest at noon, get up early in the morning, in addition to fully mobilizing the village mutual aid group, school children and textile group women, people who can go to the ground, all participated in rushing to plant, and in order to ensure that the seedlings germinate quickly, the seeds are all soaked in warm water, which not only guarantees fast germination, but also kills seedlings. It was also decided to give priority to planting for the families of soldiers and demobilized soldiers. At dawn on the morning of the 14th, as soon as the bell rang, everyone carried their plows and drove their donkeys to the fields.

　　抓紧时机组织全半劳力
    落了雨就突击抢种
    企之县干星夜出发赴各区领导
    【本报讯】冀南各地于三、四日落雨后，各县即突击抢种。三日企之县普遍落雨，四日晨在电话上从坐区县干中了解各区雨量都是二三指，勉强可播种，但群众仍在犹豫。县委曾当即召开县级科长以上扩大会议，布置抢种，确定县级各机关除留少数人支持工作，冯县书、王县长、建设科袁科长、武委会申主任、县委会褚朝明同志、县府王秘书、民政科何科长等十六人当即星夜奔赴各区推动补种抢种，王县长赶至二区即号召区干以身作则，帮助群众拉耧拉砘子，争取三天抢种完毕。二区群众二千八百六十三人很快组织起来，在王县长亲身带头下积极抢种，吕寨晚上还种地，天到半夜还听见砘子响声。经过三大突击，全区共抢种八万三千六百一十三亩；特别是东小区，共组织了长期互助组一百七十九个、临时互助组二百三十二个，二千零二十八人涌向地里，共抢种三万一千六百亩。永年四日喜雨普降，约有二三指深。领导上于抢收中推动群众抢种，因雨水不大。起初群众表示犹豫，经过干部的带头帮助、说服，各村掀起抢种热潮：县书李新同志亲到石官营领导帮助群众抢种，鼓起大家情绪，雨天播种晚苗十顷。二区东陈固一天抢种十五顷，郭庄男女老幼齐上手，一天抢种六顷。
    【本报冀南二十四日电】高唐自上月底下透雨后，三天到五天内全县完成抢种。二小麻庄男女老少总动员突击抢种，男劳力集中牲口耕耩，牲口不够的以人拉代替，小孩拔野菜，妇女配合男人撒种耩地，木匠工人拿着家具，耧和砘子破了立刻收拾，三大种完三百三十亩。四区王寨男女总动员，创造“一扫光”的突击方式，男人耕、耩、锄，女人和小孩采野菜备荒、拔草，全区统计，已种九千八百八十五亩，耕地四千七百八十一亩，地一万一千零三十七亩，挖刺菜六千五百余斤，并把野菜晒干，以备灾荒。四区大董庄群众并在抢种中斗倒地主董树兰和张基达，彭家村在抢种休息时讨论如何分果实；倪官屯一面斗争地主、一面抢种。
    【本报左权讯】本月十三号下午二点半钟，三区隘峪口一带下了大雨，约半个钟头停雨后，东隘峪口村村长张通、政治主任皇甫＠二位同志，即积极领导生产技术研究委员人员，到地实际跟验，均落二指余雨。便马上领导全村男女进行抢种，全村计未下种谷地及麻地等二百三十四亩，该村共有牲畜二十八头，每天每人可下种三亩，一天即可下种八十余亩，三天足可下种完毕，为了争取时间，大家决定晌午不息晌，早晨起早，除将全村互助组完全动起来外，学校儿童及纺织组妇女，能下地的人，全部参加抢种，又为了保证小苗快萌芽，种籽均进行温汤浸种，一则保证出苗快，二则又能杀害苗。并决定先给抗属、荣退军人下种。十四号早晨天刚看见人，钟声一响，大家都背着犁赶着毛驴往地里去了。            （克昌、炳鉴）
