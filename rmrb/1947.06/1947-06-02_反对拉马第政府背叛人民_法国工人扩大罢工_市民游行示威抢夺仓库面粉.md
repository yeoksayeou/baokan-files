Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th. Comprehensive reports: The French Ramadier government's betrayal of the interests of the nation and the people, throwing itself into the arms of the reactionaries, and forcing the French Communist Party to withdraw from the cabinet, has encountered serious difficulties, and the political crisis is growing daily. Because Ramadier delayed resolving the wage issue and ignored the reasonable demands of workers across the country, the wage increase movement led by the French General Confederation of Labor, which has more than five million members, has expanded throughout the country. Workers in various industries are rising up to engage in serious struggles with the reactionaries. Workers at the Renault factory are continuing their strike. Workers at the Koubei major flour mills and all metallurgical factories in the Paris region have successively joined the strike wave. Dockworkers at ports such as Nice and Sète continue to strike, demanding increased wages and improved food supplies. Workers at various factories of the electricity and gas companies decided to strike on the 28th of this month. The national economic and industrial life will be paralyzed due to the shutdown of power plants. Thus, Ramadier hastily ordered the "national requisition" of factories of the national electricity and gas companies (note: that is, the government controls the factories and forces workers to work) and prepared to send troops to occupy the factories. The French National Union of Bakery Workers held a meeting on the 25th and proposed the demand for increased compensation. A large-scale strike movement is brewing. Due to the lack of grain and the extreme difficulty for people to obtain food supplies, grain grabbing incidents have occurred in various places. Citizens in Rochefort, Dijon and other places marched and demonstrated, seizing all the flour from the warehouses of the National Control Bureau. Steelworkers in Lyon held a strike parade to protest the food crisis. Thousands of workers and citizens broke into the city hall, shouting: "Bread! Bread!" In many places, riots have occurred due to the lack of food among farmers. Ramadier delivered a speech to the National Assembly on the 23rd, exclaiming: "We are in a period of economic difficulties that force us to worry, and food difficulties that cause us to be responsible for quelling riots!" Ramadier greatly slandered the left-wing parties and issued threats to the people, saying, "The government will not hesitate to resist with force!" As a powerful response to Ramadier's speech, René Vion, Secretary-General of the Bakery Workers' Union, said: "We bakers, like our fellow workers in various factories, will never pay attention to the government's requisition." Folachiu, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, declared: "We will continue to defend the reasonable demands of the working class, just as we are supporting them now."

　　反对拉马第政府背叛人民
    法国工人扩大罢工
    市民游行示威抢夺仓库面粉
    【新华社陕北三十日电】综合报导：法国拉马第政府背叛民族和人民利益，投向反动派怀抱，迫使法共退出内阁后，已遭遇到严重困难，政治危机日益增长。由于拉马第拖延解决工资问题，漠视全国工人的合理要求，拥有五百余万会员的法国总工会所领导的增资运动，已扩展到全国各地，各业工人正奋起与反动派进行严重的斗争。雷诺工厂工人仍在继续罢工中。寇贝各大面粉厂及巴黎区所有冶金工厂的工人均相继卷入罢工浪潮。尼斯、塞特等海港码头工人继续罢工，要求增加工资及改善食粮供应。电气及煤气公司各工厂的工人决于本月二十八日罢工，全国的经济和工业生活会因动力工厂的停工而陷于麻痹，于是拉马第便急忙下令将全国电气与煤气公司各工厂由“国家征用”（按：即由政府管制工厂，强迫工人劳动），并准备派军队占领工厂。法国全国面包工人职工会已于二十五日开会，并提出增发补偿费的要求，大规模罢工运动正在酝酿中。由于谷物缺乏和人民获取粮食供应品极端困难，抢粮事件已在各地发生。罗舍尔、第戎等地市民游行示威，并将国家管制局仓库中的面粉抢夺一空。里昂钢铁工人举行罢工游行，抗议食粮危机，数千工人与市民闯入市政府，高呼：“面包！面包！”在很多地方，因农民缺乏粮食发生了骚动。拉马第于二十三日向国会发表演说，惊呼：“我们正处在一个经济困难迫使我们提心吊胆，粮食困难引起我们应负责平息骚乱的时期！”拉马第对左翼政党大肆诬蔑，并对人民发出恫吓之词，谓“政府将不惜以兵力抵制！”作为对拉马第演说的有力回答，面包工人职工会总书记赫内温说：“我们面包工人将如各工厂的工人同志一样，决不会理睬政府的征用。”总工会总书记福拉邱宣称：“我们将继续卫护工人阶级的合理要求，一如现在我们正支持着他们一样。”
