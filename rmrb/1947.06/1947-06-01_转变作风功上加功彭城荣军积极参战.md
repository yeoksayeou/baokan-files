　　【Our Newspaper, Ci County News】Pengcheng veterans held a forum, determined to unite closely with local cadres and the masses, to fully support the war. On the tenth of this month, more than forty veterans of the town gathered for a forum. The method was to first state their merits, then express grievances, and examine their relationship with village cadres and the masses. After mobilization, veteran Ran Weizhen first said: "No one can deny our merits, but we sometimes rely on our merits to ignore village cadres, alienate the masses, claim more benefits, and fail to cooperate with village work. These were all mistakes in the past. Now the superiors call for full support of the war and to meet the great counter-offensive, all the veterans in our town should organize and elect representatives to cooperate with village cadres to meet this great task." Then everyone came to examine themselves, unanimously believing that they are glorious, but if they become detached from the masses, they will destroy their own glory. After the self-examination, the veterans' morale greatly improved. Li Cheng volunteered to lead the militia to participate in the war, and many others participated in transporting the wounded. Veteran Li Guocai, who worked at the village reception station, personally fed water to the wounded when they arrived and used his own money to buy things for them to eat. He also comforted them to rest well, narrating his own experiences of recuperating in the hospital and how the masses supported him in the land reform movement after he came to the village, which greatly moved the wounded soldiers. This time, in response to the call to plant cotton and fight against the drought, Comrade Zhu Youlin led the masses to carry water, which played a promoting role. Now all the veterans in the town have put forward the slogan of adding merit to merit and making glory even more glorious, and their morale is very high.

　　转变作风功上加功彭城荣军积极参战
    【本报磁县讯】彭城荣誉军人开座谈会，决心与当地干部、群众亲密团结，以便全力支援战争。本月十日该镇四十多个荣誉军人集会座谈。方法是先表功劳再发牢骚，并检讨与村干、群众的关系。经过动员后，首由荣誉人冉维珍说：“我们的功劳谁也不能否认，但我们也有时依仗功劳不尿村干，突出群众，多领果实，不配合村上工作，这都是过去不对，现上级号召全力支援战争，迎接大反攻，我们全镇荣誉军人应组织起来，选出代表配合村干迎接这一巨大任务”。接着大家都来检讨，一致认为自己是光荣的，如脱离群众便会自己把自己的光荣毁灭。经过检讨荣誉军人情绪大大提高，李成自报奋勇带领民兵参战，并有多人参加运送伤兵，在村招待所工作的荣军李国才同志，彩号来到时他便亲自喂喝水，把自己钱与彩号买东西吃。并安慰彩号好好休养，叙述自己在医院养伤和到村以后各方招待及翻身运动中群众如何拥护等情况，彩号极为感动。此次号召植棉与旱灾做斗争，朱有林同志带领群众担水起了推动作用，现全镇荣誉军人提出功上再加工，光荣更光荣的口号情绪非常高涨。
