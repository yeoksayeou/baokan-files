Workers in the Tenth District of Wu'an Participate in the War
    Rewarded for Rushing to Dig Fortifications

    [This newspaper] More than seventy workers in the tenth district, under the leadership of Comrade Duan Zhen, went to the front to help the troops dig fortifications. When they left, they all scrambled to sign up voluntarily and put forward the slogan: "Digging fortifications is digging up the roots of evil; we must dig the Wu'an Home-Returning Corps into our hands, eradicating the roots of evil!" Therefore, under the hail of bullets half a mile away from the enemy, they put forth their utmost strength to move forward, overcoming all difficulties. They bent over, hunched their heads, took off their clothes, removed their shoes and socks, covered in mud, panting, their nostrils turned black, and yet they did not rest. They also put forward the slogan: "Only if we sweat more, can the troops shed less blood." While others only dug eight meters a day, they dug fifteen meters, more than double the amount. In addition to completing their own tasks, they also helped others dig. The troops individually awarded them a banner of "Model War-Participating Workers," six hundred eggs, forty-nine packs of cigarettes, twenty catties of vermicelli, a part of vegetables, three letters of condolence from the battalion headquarters, thirty boxes of cigarettes, a letter of condolence from the leaders of the × Column Headquarters, and a reward of 10,000 yuan. After receiving these awards, they saved 300 catties of grain and handed it over to the Dongchaiku Village Public Office to help local refugees, and 203 eggs were handed over to the County Command for forwarding to the front lines as a consolation.
