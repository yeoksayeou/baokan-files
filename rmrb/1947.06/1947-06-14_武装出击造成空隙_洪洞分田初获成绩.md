　　Armed Raids Create Opportunities
    Initial Successes in Land Redistribution in Hongdong
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 9th] According to a report by Cao Shijing, Chairman of the Hongdong County Farmers' Association: 106 villages in the county (accounting for 70% of the county) had initially completed land reform before the wheat harvest. The county began land distribution in February this year, and for the four months leading up to the wheat harvest, it consistently implemented the integrated movement of armed struggle and land distribution. All cadres performed meritorious service for the people, vying to kill the enemy and protect the masses' struggle. Comrade Shi Zhaopu of the First District, while leading the masses of ×× village to implement land reform, also led militia heroes Zhang Bofu, Chang Xiushan, and others to attack the enemy. On May 7th and 8th, they killed 12 enemy soldiers, including a company commander. Comrade Ji Hengyuan of the Second District has been active in the vicinity of the county seat, publicizing our land reform policy to stubborn puppet personnel. The Shang Qingfu explosives team protected the masses of ×× village in land distribution, while another part went to the front of the West City Gate to cut enemy telephone lines, and on May 18th, repelled the enemy's intrusion from Qinbi, killing and wounding five. Comrade Guo Jinrong of the Fourth District cooperated with the security team to raid the enemy near Yangxie, killing and wounding several enemy soldiers. During this period, the armed village governments in each village also fully exerted their power, and the land distribution in each village in the border areas was under their leadership. Therefore, in the past four months, the enemy has only harassed beyond ten li three times, and each time they were surrounded and attacked by our militia and local armed forces, fleeing in disarray.

　　武装出击造成空隙
    洪洞分田初获成绩
    【本报太岳九日电】据洪洞县农会主席曹士敬报导：该县在麦收前已有一百零六村（占全县百分之七十）初步完成了土地改革。该县自今年二月开始分田，至麦前四个月中，始终贯彻着武装与分田两位一体运动。全体干部为民立功，争相杀敌，掩护群众斗争。一区师兆普同志一面领导××村群众实行土地改革，一面又带领民兵英雄张伯福、常秀山等向敌人出击。五月七、八两日，打死敌连长以下十二人。二区吉恒元同志一直活动在县城近郊，向顽伪人员宣传我之土地改革政策。尚清富爆炸队一部分掩护××村群众分田，一部分进至西城门前割敌电线，并于五月十八日击退秦壁出犯之敌，毙伤五名。四区郭金荣同志配合保安队突击羊獬附近之敌，毙伤敌人数名。各村武装村公所在此时期中也充分发挥其威力，边沿区各村之分田无一不在其领导之下。因此四个月以来全县敌人出扰十里以外者仅三次，并皆被我民兵及地方武装四面包围夹击，狼狈逃窜。
