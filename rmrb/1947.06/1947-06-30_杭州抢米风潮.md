Hangzhou Dispatch: This afternoon, while passing the intersection of Qingtai Street and Dongjie Road, I saw several soldiers running head-on, some covered in mud and looking utterly disheveled. A large crowd of people was chasing after them, shouting, "Catch them! Catch them!" I stepped aside and watched them run into the street entrance. Suddenly, "Bang, bang, bang!" Three gunshots rang out, and the pursuing crowd retreated.

Upon inquiry, I learned that the "Taihe" rice shop ahead had been wrecked by the poor because the shop had raised prices and refused to sell its rice. When the shop was being wrecked, several soldiers stepped forward to suppress the crowd but were met with a barrage of fists and kicks. Two were injured, and the rest fled in disarray, covering their heads. The crowd chased them until the guards at the street entrance opened fire.

At this point, several rice shops on Qingtai Street had been attacked. A shop named "Juyuan" was swarming with "customers." The entrance was bustling, with people entering empty-handed and leaving loaded with rice. A "China Travel Service" car happened to be passing by. The "gentleman" inside flew into a rage because something thrown by the crowd had struck his vehicle. The crowd then promptly dismantled his small car.

A group of "spectating" merchants on the roadside were discussing:

"Yuyuanfeng rice shop in Guankou Lane has been attacked."

"Many rice shops on Dongjie Road and near Longxiang Bridge have been attacked."

"Zhongshan North Road is paved with 'white rice.'"

"So it's become Zhongshan 'White' (North) Road!"

"The Second Branch Bureau on Wushan Road was also attacked because the police went to protect the Baochang rice shop with guns. The police officer even got punched and kicked."

"Who told them to meddle? They deserved it, they deserved it!"

"The police on Changqing Street were also meddling, trying to take the rice grabbers back to the station for punishment, and they got a good beating from the poor."

I hurried to Zhongshan North Road and saw groups of people busily at work. They were flooding the rice shops on both sides, wrecking furniture, scattering rice, and taking rice. Two military policemen stood in front of a rice shop called "Gongxingsui," trying to block the crowd, but the crowd still rushed in, leaving them in disarray. The military policemen had no choice but to quietly leave.

Even in this angry action, the hungry masses maintained mutual care. An old man with a gray beard was shouting, "Men, don't carry whole bags! Let the women take some too!" Several young people were also shouting, "Let everyone eat rice!" and were pouring rice from their bags into the baskets and pockets of women and children.

"Only the poor love the poor!" I thought to myself.

Back at my lodging, several students were talking loudly.

"I knew something was going to happen. Yesterday and the day before, you couldn't even buy a 'sheng' (升, a unit of volume) of rice for more than two thousand yuan."

"What two thousand? I know the black market price reached three thousand two!"

"Coolies and peddlers were already clamoring to 'buy rice without paying.'"

"Yes, I also heard that many people wanted to attack the rice shops. This is called 'The wind foretells the coming storm.'"

"Today isn't the 'storm' yet; it's just a gust of wind. The real downpour is probably still to come! With the rice price constantly rising, how many days can today's rice grab last?" (Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th)

### 杭州抢米风潮

　　杭州抢米风潮
    杭州通讯：记者下午路过清泰街与东街路交岔路口，见几个军人迎面奔来，有的满身泥污，狼狈不堪，背后一大群老百姓追赶着，高呼：“捉住！捉住！”我让在一边，看他们进到街口，忽然“啪，啪，啪！”三声枪响，追赶的人又折了回去。
    一打听才知道前面的“太和”米店被穷人捣毁，因为这米店抬高市价，有米不卖。在捣毁时，几个军人出面镇压，被群众一顿老拳，打得两个受伤，其余的也一齐抱头鼠窜，群众追去，到街口卫兵开了枪。
    这时清泰街有好几家米店被打，有名“聚源”者，“顾客”蜂涌，门庭若市，尽皆空手而进，负载而出。时有“中国旅行社”一包车经过，车上的“老爷”因群众抛出的东西误触车辆，发了雷霆，群众便七手八脚把他的小包车拆毁了。
    路旁一群“观光”的商人们谈论着：
    “官巷口裕源丰米店被打了。”
    “东街路和龙翔桥许多米店都打了。”
    “中山北路铺成‘白米路’了。”
    “那就成了中山‘白’（北）路呀！”
    “吴山路第二分局也被打了，因为警察拿着枪去保护宝昌米店，警官还吃了拳头脚尖。”
    “谁叫他们多管闲事？该打，该打！”
    “长庆街的警察也多事，要把抢米的人带回局里惩办，被穷人们打了好一顿。”
    我赶到中山北路，见一群群的老百姓正在忙碌着，他们塞满了两旁的米店，在捣毁家具，在散米，在拿米。一家叫“公兴穗”的米店门前站着两个宪兵，阻挡群众，但群众仍冲了进去，打得个落花流水。宪兵只好悄悄走开。
    饥饿的群众在这样激愤的行动中还保持着互相的关怀；一个胡须斑白的老头在叫：“男子汉不要成袋成袋背，让女人们也拿点！”几个青年也在叫：“有米大家吃！”提着米袋向妇女儿童的篮子及口袋里把米倒去。
    “只有穷人才爱穷人啊！”我暗想。
    回到住所，几个学生正在高谈阔论。
    “我早就知道要出事，昨前天两千多元还买不到一升米。”
    “什么两千多，我知道黑市到了三千二！”
    “苦力和小贩们早就闹着‘买米不给钱’了。”
    “是呀，我也听说好多人想打米店。这叫做‘山雨欲来风满楼。’”
    “今天不算‘山雨’；只算刮一阵风；真正的倾盆大雨恐怕还在后头啊！米价不断涨，今天抢的米能吃几天？”（新华社陕北二十七日电）
