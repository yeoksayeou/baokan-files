　　Zuoquan County Government Directs Villages to Establish Drought Prevention and Famine Preparedness Committees
    [Our Newspaper Zuoquan News] The Zuoquan County government has once again issued instructions on seizing the time to plant, save seedlings, practice long-term conservation, and prepare for famine. The instructions stated briefly: The drought situation has already formed. Seedlings that have been planted are experiencing disease due to lack of rain. In addition, there is still a portion that has not been sown. Time is now of the essence, and we should immediately take action, break away from the mentality of waiting for rain, and launch a campaign to rush planting, replanting, and saving seedlings. To this end, organizationally, drought prevention and famine preparedness committees should be established at the village level, with the participation of key cadres from the village head, farmers' association, women's association, and armed forces committee systems to form a strong leadership group. Secondly, all cadres must lead the masses in calculating accounts, overcome wishful thinking, and allow the masses to naturally recognize the importance of production and conservation by reviewing their own experiences in overcoming famine.

　　左权县府指示各村
    成立防旱备荒委员会
    【本报左权讯】左权县府再次发出抢种救苗长期节约备荒的指示：指示略称：目前旱象已成，已种小苗，因缺雨发生灾病，此外，尚有一部分未下种的，目前时间已刻不容缓，应立即行动起来，打破等雨思想，开展抢种、补种、救苗运动。为此在组织上应以村为单位成立防旱备荒委员会，由村长、农会、妇会、武委会各系统主要干部参加，形成有力的领导集团。其次全体干部必须领导群众进行算账，克服侥幸心理，让群众从回顾自己渡荒经验中，自然而然的认识生产节约的重要。（办公室）
