    Most Cadre Dependents Achieve Self-Sufficiency Through Production
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the higher authorities issued the call for production and thrift, the twenty-two dependents of the Xinhua Bookstore have been working hard to achieve self-sufficiency and have made great achievements. Zhang Junlian, the wife of Comrade Wang Chun, the editor-in-chief, took the lead and proposed that, starting in April, she would not receive any grain subsidies from the public and would be entirely self-sufficient through production. Her exemplary actions promoted the production enthusiasm of all the dependents. Comrade Liu Fu also requested that he would not receive any public grain subsidies starting in June. Following this, the wives of Comrades Wang Zhenhai of the Distribution Section, Comrade Qiao Xiuying, and Comrade Jia Dezhen of the Xingtai Branch all proposed to catch up with Comrades Zhang and Liu, step up production, and not take any public subsidies starting in June. Comrade Wang Zhenhai also plans that once her health improves, she will not even ask the public to bear the living expenses of her children. Cao Zhiguo, a worker at the Xiecheng Printing Factory, has a 50-year-old mother who said to her son, "The public is in difficulty, everyone should work hard to produce and take care of themselves. Your sister and I will also produce to support ourselves. Tell the public that starting next month (July), we will be self-sufficient." The leadership praised her enthusiasm but also considered her health and plans to give her appropriate care.
    [Report from this newspaper] In order to actively prepare for the counter-offensive and overcome financial difficulties, the dependents of the cadres of Jianhua Company first proposed that they should not be a burden on the public and should strive to achieve self-sufficiency. At first, most of the female comrades could not understand this ideologically because they had just come out of their homes and thought that they could not achieve self-sufficiency by producing with children and were heavily reliant. After patient explanation and the help of comrades and more than a month of experimentation, most have achieved self-sufficiency. From April 10th to May 20th, Comrade Zhang Yong produced more than 11,000 yuan, Comrade Cao Jinling produced more than 10,000 yuan, and Comrade Yang Lin was already 44 years old, and her hands and eyes were not good, but she was not willing to lag behind, and in two months and ten days she produced more than 14,000 yuan. Other female comrades produced more than 7,000 to 10,000 yuan. Their production methods were: sewing for the Clothing Bureau, sewing sweaters and sock cuffs for the Woolen Textile Factory, spinning wool, tearing wool; braiding for the Straw Hat Factory, sewing hat tips, spinning thread; making shoes and clothes for male comrades, etc. Comrade Zhang Yong was commended on the merit list at the mid-May merit evaluation meeting because she produced the most, could help others, and could research and create new methods that were both fast and good. Now all eight family members are in high spirits and plan to ensure that even their children do not require public assistance in the future. (Jianzhong)

    大部干属生产自给
    【本报讯】新华书店二十二位家属，自上级提出生产节约号召后，即努力生产自给，现已获得很大成绩。开始总编辑王春同志的爱人张君莲同志，首先提出从四月份起不领公家补助米，自己全部生产自给。她的模范行动推动了全体家属的生产热情，刘富同志也自请自六月份起不领公家补助米。接着有发行科的王珍孩同志、乔秀英同志及邢台分店贾德贞同志的爱人都提出赶上张刘二同志，加紧生产，从六月份起一律不要公家补助；王珍孩同志还计划等她身体健康些后，连小孩的生活费也不要公家负担。协成印刷厂曹治国同志五十岁的老母亲也同他儿子说：“公家困难，大家都努力生产，自己顾自己，我和你妹妹也要自己生产养活自己，你给公家说，从下月（七月）起我们就自给”。现领导上表扬了她的热情又考虑她的健康问题，计划仍给以适当照顾。
    【本报讯】为了积极准备反攻，克服财经困难，建华公司干部家属首先提出不叫公家负担，努力做到自给。开始大部女同志因刚从家中出来，思想打不通，以为带着孩子生产不能自给，依靠思想很大。经过耐心解释，同志们的帮助和一个多月的实验，大部已做到自给：自四月十号到五月二十号张勇同志共生产洋一万一千余元，曹金零同志共生产洋一万余元，杨林同志已经四十四岁了，手眼都不得劲，也不愿落后，两个月零十天共生产洋一万四千余元；其他女同志都在七千到一万元以上。她们的生产方法是：给成衣局缝东西，给毛织工厂缝毛衣缝袜口，纺毛线，撕羊毛；给草帽工厂括辫子，缝帽尖，纺线；给男同志做鞋做衣服等。张勇同志因生产最多又能帮助别人，能研究创造新的办法，又快又好，在五月中旬评功会上，上了功劳簿。现在全体家属共八人，情绪都很高，并计划今后做到孩子也不要公家负担。（建中）
