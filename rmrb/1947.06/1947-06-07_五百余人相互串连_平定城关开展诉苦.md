More Than Five Hundred People Unite
Pingding Chengguan Carries Out Speaking Bitterness

[This newspaper Pingding news] In Pingding Chengguan district, 570 poor people have participated in training classes and are now carrying out speaking bitterness. The Chengguan turnaround team first conducted in-depth investigations into the social conditions of each street, and then went door-to-door to ask about suffering, starting with casual conversation and revealing thoughts to guide people to find the roots of their suffering. After mobilization and enlightenment, many people with suffering spoke out. Wang Shouye from Southwest Camp, who was a beggar, said the first thing after the cadres found him was, "I have been begging all my life. Now that the Communist Party has come, I must break this begging bowl and rise up to make a turnaround." He quickly gathered more than a dozen poor people to hold a meeting. Wu Jihui, a tenant in Shizi Street, rented eight mu of land from others. At first, he didn't know why he couldn't make ends meet. After calculating, he realized that the eight mu of land he rented from others only produced ten shi of miscellaneous grains each year. Last year, he paid out two hundred jin of rice and one hundred and ninety jin of wheat, resulting in a loss of thirty to forty jin. After the calculation, he understood and realized that he was impoverished by the exploitation of the landlord. He immediately volunteered to participate in the training class to learn skills and go back to fight for a turnaround.

After such visits, leading out of bitterness, and digging up the roots of poverty in each street, and at the same time, resolving various thoughts of fear, change of regime, conscience, fate, etc., most of the masses had the desire to turn around, and the enthusiasm for suppressing traitors and revenge became even greater. For example, Shang Wanfu from Gugusi said: "I built a blockhouse for the enemy and wealthy man. The original price was 300,000 yuan, but he gave me 250,000 yuan less. This time, I will risk my old life of sixty years to vent this anger and settle this account." Tenant Zhang Chengxiu said: "The dog-day landlord Miao family made it impossible for me to live on my land. Today, I must settle the account." In this way, the movement spread from one row to another.

　　五百余人相互串连
    平定城关开展诉苦
    【本报平定讯】平定城关区五百七十个穷人参加了训练班，现正开展诉苦。城关翻身队首先深入了解各街社会情况，继即深入挨户访苦，从说家常，扯心思，引导找苦根，经过动员启发，许多有苦的人都诉出苦来。西南营王守业是个讨吃的，干部找见他后，他第一句话即说我要了一辈子饭啦，今天共产党来啦，我一定要打破这个讨吃碗，起来闹翻身。很快相约了十余个贫人来开会。十字街佃户吴记辉，他租人家八亩地，初扯总不知道自己为什么不能过，一算账才知道他租人家的八亩地每年只产十石杂粮，去年出了二百斤米，一百九十斤麦子，这样亏下三四石，经过计算后，他打通了思想，认清自己被地主剥削穷了，即自动要求参加训练班学习本领回去斗争翻身。
    各街经过这样访问、引苦、刨穷根，同时随时解决各种害怕、变天、良心、命运等思想，大部群众有了翻身要求，反奸复仇劲头更大。如姑姑寺尚万福说：“我给敌人老财修炮楼，原搞定三十万元，少给了我二十五万元，这次我舍着六十岁的老命也得出出这口气，算算这笔账。”佃户张成秀说：“狗日地主苗家下了我地不能活，今天非算账不行。”运动就这样一行串通一行的展开了。
