　　Bravely Persisting Behind Enemy Lines
    Comrade Bian Yunmin Heroically Sacrifices His Life
    [Report from this newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan correspondent, 18th] Comrade Bian Yunmin, head of the 9th District of Juancheng, valiantly sacrificed his life while persisting in guerrilla warfare. He was a glorious Communist Party member. After the enemy occupied Juancheng, he consistently led the people of the district in persisting in the struggle. At the end of April, he was captured by the enemy during an enemy "mopping-up" encirclement. The enemy tortured him in every possible way, attempting to extract secrets from District Head Bian. However, District Head Bian remained steadfast. During interrogation by the puppet county magistrate, District Head Bian burst into curses, denouncing him for being a traitorous running dog who brought disaster to the country and people. After District Head Bian was tied up at the execution ground outside the north gate of Juancheng, the traitors stabbed him all over with bayonets. He showed no fear, and even as the enemy executed him by firing squad, he shouted: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live the liberation of the peasants!"

　　奋不顾身坚持敌后
    边运民同志英勇牺牲
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】鄄城九区区长边运民同志，坚持游击战，壮烈牺牲。他是个光荣的共产党员，敌人占领鄄城后，始终领导该区人民坚持斗争，四月底在敌“清剿”包围中，被敌捕去，敌人百般拷打，想从边区长口中探出秘密，但边区长坚定不移，在伪县长审问时，边区长破口责骂，斥其当汉奸走狗祸国殃民，当边区长被绑到鄄城北门外刑场后，汉奸们用刺刀向他浑身乱刺，他毫无惧色，直到被敌人枪毙时，他仍高呼：“共产党万岁！”“农民翻身万岁！”
