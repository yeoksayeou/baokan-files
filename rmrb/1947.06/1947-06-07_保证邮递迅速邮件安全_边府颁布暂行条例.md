　　The Border Region Government promulgated provisional regulations last month to protect postal workers, stating: "In order to strengthen the connection between the front and rear, and to maintain the speed and safety of mail, if the iron-wheeled postal vehicles are damaged by water on general roads, or are blocked or damaged due to military circumstances, they may, with the approval of the competent authorities, travel on motor vehicle roads; at river crossings along the postal workers' routes, boatmen should reduce or waive fees and give priority to ferrying them. If they are moored and there are no military circumstances, they should also be ferried across the river at any time. When encountering crowded passes, bridges, or roads, postal workers should be allowed to pass first. During general curfews, as long as postal workers carry badges or passes issued by the post office, local checkpoints and sentry posts must not open and inspect mail en route, and they must be allowed to pass. Local governments should provide convenience for food and lodging along the way (but they must not demand it arbitrarily without giving compensation). In case of sudden illness, local governments and people should not only try to provide first aid, but also entrust someone to deliver the mail they carry to the delivery bureau (the wages will be paid by the post office). In case of rain, snow, or loss of direction (especially military mail, armed transport teams, and night shifts), or encountering enemy situations in war zones, encountering special agents committing crimes, bandits robbing, or sudden river floods, local governments and the masses should assist in guiding the route, cover the mail, and provide rescue, to ensure the safety of personnel and mail." The regulations also stated that the above provisions are designed to protect postal workers and ensure the safety and speed of mail, and postal workers must not take the opportunity to engage in smuggling or violate laws and regulations. Furthermore, the badges or passes should be carefully protected, and if they are lost or lent to others to impersonate postal personnel, they will be severely punished.

　　[Another News] The General Post Office issued instructions to the various regional management bureaus regarding the above regulations: "The promulgation of this regulation is an important link in increasing speed. We must actively use various opportunities to carry out publicity and explanation, so that the masses in the entire region understand it. At the same time, we must also strictly educate postal workers to be honest and abide by the law."

　　保证邮递迅速邮件安全  边府颁布暂行条例
    【本报讯】边府于上月颁发保护邮工暂行条例内称：为密切前后方连系，保持邮件的速度和安全，今后铁脚邮车在一般道路被水冲坏、或因军事情况而封锁、破坏时，经主管机关允准，可于汽路上通行；邮工路经之河流渡口，各船户可予以减价免费并尽先载运，如在停泊期间而非军事情况，亦应随时航送过岸。遇到有关隘桥梁人马拥挤，应先让邮工通行。一般戒严时间，只要邮工带有邮局制发之证章或通行证，各地关卡岗哨便不得中途拆验邮件，并得允其通行。在途中食宿，当地政府应予以便利。（但不得不给代价，任意索要）。发生急病当地政民除了设法急救外，所带邮件须委妥人送交投递局（工价由邮局付出）。雨天、雪地迷失方向（特别是军邮、武交队、夜班），或在战争地区发现敌情，遇到特务行凶，土匪抢劫，河水暴涨等，当地政府及群众，应协助指引路线，掩护邮件，予以拯救，以保障人员及邮件安全，条例中并提出以上原为爱护邮工保障邮件安全迅速而设，邮工不得借故走私，违犯法纪，到于证章或通行证，更应加意保护，如有遗失或借与别人冒充邮政人员，应受严重处分。
    【又讯】邮务总局当就以上条例指示各区管理局：这一条例的颁布，是提高速度的重要环节，要主动利用各种机会进行宣传解释，务使全区群众了解，同时亦应严格邮工教育，奉公守法。
