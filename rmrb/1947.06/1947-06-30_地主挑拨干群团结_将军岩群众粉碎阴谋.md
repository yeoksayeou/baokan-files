　　Landlord Provokes Cadre-Masses Unity
    Masses of Jiangjunyan Smash Conspiracy
    [Our newspaper, JiluYu, 28th dispatch] The masses in Jiangjunyan, Erqu, Guancheng, smashed a conspiracy by landlords to split the unity of the peasantry and kill with a borrowed knife. During land reform, the village chief of the village privately used a few items of clothing from the fruits of the struggle, which caused some dissatisfaction among the masses. This time, during the district's rectification of cadre-masses relations, the landlord took the opportunity to split the unity between cadres and the masses, using "lackeys" to create an atmosphere against corruption. They said the village cadres were corrupt and all the things seized during the struggle had been spent by the cadres, thus amplifying the dissatisfaction of the masses. When district cadres attended a mass meeting in the village, a bad element named Zhang Jinbang secretly mobilized the masses, instigating them by saying, "The village cadres are drinking our blood." Then he incited the masses, "What should we do?" Some masses who had been bought off said, "First, tie up the village chief and send him to the district, and then take everything from his house!" They insisted on doing it that night. The district cadre, seeing the situation was problematic, said they needed to collect more materials on corruption and couldn't do it right away. The next day, they learned that the landlord of the village had secretly decided to have the "lackey" Zhang Jinbang become the village chief. When the meeting started, the district cadre said, "The collected corruption materials are not enough, and we need to further promote democracy." After openly calling for it, the district cadre comrades found some honest peasants for individual detailed talks, and enlightened them to think about who the village cadres were working for. Although the village cadres made the mistake of embezzling a few items of clothing, comparing it with the landlord's long-term exploitation and oppression of the poor, who drank the blood of the poor? How did we deal with the landlords, and how should we deal with the village cadres? The peasants became aware and told the truth about the incident being arranged by Zhang Jinbang, and said who was forced and who was misled. After learning the truth, the district cadre detained Zhang Jinbang and the landlord Zhang Xinze, and then held a meeting in the village, exposing the landlord's conspiracy.

　　地主挑拨干群团结
    将军岩群众粉碎阴谋
    【本报冀鲁豫二十八日电】观城二区将军岩群众粉碎地主分裂农民内部团结借刀杀人的阴谋。该村村长在土地改革时，私自动用了斗争果实中几件衣服，群众有些不满，这次该区整干群关系时，地主乘机分裂干群团结，利用“狗腿”首先造成反贪污的空气，说村干部贪污了，斗的东西都叫干部花完了，把群众的不满扩大起来。区干参加该村群众大会时，坏分子张金榜暗中活动群众，挑拨说：“村干部喝咱们的血”，接着鼓动群众：“如何处理？”有个别被收买的群众说：“把村长先捆起来送区，然后把他家的东西拿干净”！并坚决要当晚就办，区干部看情形有问题，便说要多搜集一些贪污材料，马上不能办，第二天了解到该村地主已经暗地决定叫“狗腿”张金榜当村长，当开会时，区干表示：“所收集的贪污材料不多，还要更进一步的发扬民主。”公开号召后，区干同志即找了几个老实农民来个别详谈，并启发他们想想村干替谁办事了，村干虽有贪污几件衣服的错误，和地主长期剥削压迫穷人的罪恶作比较，谁喝了穷人的血？我们对地主这样处理的，对村干该怎样处理？农民觉悟了，讲出事件的真情是由张金榜布置，并且把那些人是强迫的，那些人是被蒙蔽的都说了出来，区干知道真情后，便将张金榜及地主张心泽等扣押，接着在村里开会，揭露了地主的阴谋。
