Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 (Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region) 10th. Following the student anti-hunger, anti-civil war movement initiated in Beiping, Jiaotong University in Tangshan immediately responded. On May 18th, students from the school held a march and carried out street propaganda, posted slogans, and gave speeches, shouting slogans such as "Oppose Hunger, Oppose Civil War, Oppose Dictatorship." On May 31st, because student representatives such as Du Bingzhi from the school who went to Beiping to participate in the city student march were arrested, more than 500 members of Chiang's Central Military Police Corps went to the school to suppress the student movement. The students then held another protest march and promoted the call for Beiping students' strike on June 2nd, strike, strike of market, and opposition to civil war. When the procession reached the gate of the Sanqing Tuan (Three Principles of the People Youth League), it was obstructed and beaten by more than 50 armed Sanqing Tuan members, who also opened fire. More than ten students were beaten and injured, one died, and several others were arrested. However, the public sentiment became more激愤 (jī fèn, indignant) and they broke into the Sanqing Tuan headquarters and destroyed it completely. On June 2nd, Jiaotong University students went to the city to conduct propaganda and gave speeches at the Yongsheng Theater, once clashing with Chiang's military police. The citizens expressed sympathy for the students' actions. Now Tangshan is full of sentry posts, all theaters have stopped performing, the gates of all factories are closed, and the students are still on strike.
