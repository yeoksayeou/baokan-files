　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Rehe Liao, Urgent Telegram, 7th] A certain unit of the Rehe People's Liberation Army recaptured the city of Chifeng at 10:00 AM on the 6th. The defending enemy, the 2nd Regiment of the Provisional 22nd Division of the 93rd Army, abandoned the city and fled south. Our army is currently pursuing and annihilating them. The city is located at the end of the Ye (Boshou)-Chi (feng) Road and is connected by highways to Chengde, Kailu, and Linxi. It is a strategic location in Rehe Province. The Kuomintang once planned to move the capital of Rehe Province to this city in order to encroach on the leagues of Inner Mongolia, but this is now a pipe dream.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 10th] The Northeast Democratic Allied Army achieved further results in pursuing and annihilating the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek army's Youth Army 2nd Division after the recovery of Xi'an on the 3rd. Including the 1,500 previously captured, a total of over 2,800 enemy troops were annihilated. Among them, over 200 were killed or wounded, and 2,617, including the deputy regimental commander of the 6th Regiment, Chen Quan, were captured. The following were seized: six 60mm mortars, 1,603 rifles, 280 light machine guns, 30 heavy machine guns, 12 submachine guns, four jeeps, three radio stations, over 200,000 rounds of ammunition, and some grain.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 10th] In the battle to pursue and annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek army's 71st Army on the Huai (de)-Gong (zhuling) line, the 3rd Battalion of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army, from the time it received the order to set out to the end of the battle, ran for 25 li (approximately 12.5 km) in just one hour and fifty minutes, creating a brilliant example of a pursuit and annihilation battle. On the 18th of last month, after receiving the order, the battalion immediately ran as a whole, with no one falling behind. After catching up with the Chiang Kai-shek army, the 9th Company first cut the enemy's long snake formation into three sections. The 6th Platoon of the 7th Company then swiftly maneuvered around and intercepted the enemy head-on. The hero Chen Hongfa's platoon braved the enemy's fire net of five heavy machine guns, passed through an open area of about 50 to 60 meters in fifteen minutes, and continuously captured two bunkers, controlling the high ground. The 8th Company even more swiftly attacked the enemy's vehicles, catching the enemy off guard. The battalion finally achieved great results: a total of 431 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers below the rank of lieutenant colonel were captured. The following were seized: nine towed howitzers, three 81mm mortars, five anti-tank guns, one rocket launcher, two 60mm mortars, five heavy machine guns, twenty-three light machine guns, thirty-seven submachine guns, one hundred and ninety-two rifles, twenty-one vehicles, and many other munitions and military supplies.
