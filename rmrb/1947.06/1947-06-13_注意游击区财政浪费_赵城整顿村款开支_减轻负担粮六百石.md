[Taiyue, June 11th, This Newspaper] The Zhao Cheng County government has established a local finance co-management review committee to eliminate waste and reduce the people's burden by 600 shi of grain. Because the county is in a guerrilla environment, local financial expenditures were previously more chaotic. For example, the Bian District burden of fine grain for Beiqin Village was 288 shi and 9 dou, while the village's internal expenditure of fine grain was 180 shi and 6 dou, accounting for more than 60% of the Bian District and local grain burden. In order to overcome this chaos, the county specifically formed a local finance review committee consisting of the county head, political commissar, farmers' association chairman, armed forces committee director, and finance section chief to co-manage local finance. After precise calculations, it was decided that in the future, the expenses of each village would be resolved through village-level fundraising and production. Except for the town head, the remaining miscellaneous staff members will all implement a "small labor" system, with each person receiving only 4 dou of millet per month. Those who do not have enough will be self-sufficient through production. Publicly funded students in people's schools have been reduced from 100 to 64, the number of teachers in the county has been reduced by 3, the number of cooks has been reduced by 4, and the subsidies for the remaining primary school teachers have been reduced from 1 shi to 8 dou. All six of the county headquarters' communication personnel have been removed, and personnel from various units will be transferred to take over. In addition, all local apportionments must be reviewed by the review committee. At present, all systems in the county have largely overcome the past phenomenon of waste, reducing the burden on the masses by 600 shi of fine grain.

　　注意游击区财政浪费
    赵城整顿村款开支
    减轻负担粮六百石
    【本报太岳十一日电】赵城县政府成立地方财政共管审查委员会，杜绝浪费，减轻群众负担粮六百石。该县因处于游击环境中，以前地方财经开支较混乱。如北秦村边区负担细粮二百八十八石九斗，而村内开支之细粮即有一百八十石六斗；占边区及地方负担粮的百分之六十以上。该县为克服此种混乱，特由县长、政委、农会主席、武委会主任及财政科长五人共组地方财政审查委员会，共管地方财政。经精确计算后，决定今后各村之经费均由村内筹备基金生产解决。除镇长外，其余几个干杂人员一律实行“小劳动”制，每人每月只供小米四斗。不足者由生产自给。民高公费生由百人减至六十四人，全县减教员三人，炊事员四人，其余小学教员之津贴均由一石减为八斗。县指挥部通讯员六人全部减去，由各单位抽调人员担任。此外，地方上一切摊派，必经审查委员会审核。现在全县各系统已大体克服了过去的浪费现象，减轻群众负担细粮六百石。
