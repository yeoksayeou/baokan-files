　　Sights and Sounds from the Eastern Manchuria Front
    Hua Shan
  　I. “The Wujiang Suicide of Songjiang”
    While fleeing from the Lao Ye Ridge, Zhang Zhi, the regimental commander of the 121st Regiment, compared himself to Xiang Yu, the heroic king who committed suicide at Wujiang, boasting to his subordinates, "I'm preparing to do a 'Suicide of Songjiang'!"
    The troops climbed in the mountains all night, unable to travel even twenty li. Commander Zhang ordered them to continue, but the soldiers sat down on the ground and said, "Where are we going!"
    The troops were about to cook, and Commander Zhang had no choice but to order the vanguard battalion to wait, but the vanguard battalion didn't listen and left first, disappearing into the forest!
    Before they could eat, the pursuers arrived. Commander Zhang ordered: "Fight!" But the soldiers said: "What's the point of fighting!" Even the system of punishing ten people connected to one "kill" didn't work. The troops quietly rolled down the mountain!
    Commander Zhang ran even faster than his troops, and soon he only had a hundred or so soldiers left. Now he didn't dare give orders anymore. He pleaded with the soldiers: "Will you please go to that mountain!" But everyone just crossed their arms, held their rifles, and sat motionless.
    Commander Zhang shouted loudly: "I don't want to live either!" He thought that such a shout would move his subordinates, but only one squad and three soldiers followed him halfway up the mountain.
    The pursuers surrounded them from all sides. This regimental commander, who was already preparing to commit "Suicide of Songjiang," should have been shouting "Long live Chairman Chiang!" But before he could shout, he scurried into the weeds like a rabbit and was finally shot dead by a hail of bullets.
    Only one guard died with him in the weeds.
  　II. “Tacit Understanding”
    The vanguard battalion, having abandoned its regimental commander in the encirclement, began to act independently. The acting battalion commander was Deputy Regimental Commander Liu Yifu, who had only been with the battalion for a few days and couldn't figure out what the company commanders were thinking. So he didn't order them to fight, nor did he tell them to surrender.
    Wandering around in the gloomy forest, three platoons suddenly disappeared. After a couple more turns, a few more platoons disappeared. The number of troops dwindled, and the sound of pursuing gunfire grew closer and closer.
    Deputy Commander Liu gathered the troops. He saw that there were only eighty or so people left, and not even a company of combat soldiers.
    Deputy Commander Liu called everyone together for a meeting, saying, "Now, what do you think we should do?"
    The machine gun company commander had already reached a tacit understanding with him, and so he spoke first: "Whatever the deputy commander says!" Just then, a 60mm mortar shell landed nearby. The meeting didn't have time to make a decision, so everyone put down their guns and went to the old liberated area with the Democratic Allied Army.
    The Kuomintang officers and soldiers who had been scattered in the forest unexpectedly arrived one after another. Deputy Commander Liu humorously said, "So it was all a tacit understanding!"
  　III. “The Democratic Allied Army Has Those Too”
    Three captured Kuomintang officers said to the landlord's child, "What are you looking at? Aren't we the Democratic Allied Army?"
    The child said, "No."
    The prisoners pointed to their green uniforms and said, "How are we not?"
    The child pointed to their boat-shaped caps, waisted uniforms, and American leather boots, one by one, and said, "Our army doesn't have these foreign hats, these foreign uniforms, or these foreign boots!"
    The child's grandmother, in order to ease the prisoners' embarrassment, scolded the child: "What do you know? Our army also wears these things!"
    The child earnestly shouted at his grandmother: "But didn't they get them from them!"

　　东满前线见闻
    华山
  　一、“松江之刎”
    从老爷岭逃窜的时候，一二一团团长洁之自比为乌江自杀的一世英雄楚霸王，对僚属吹牛说：“我要准备作松江之刎！”
    队伍在山岭里爬了一整夜，走不出二十来里，张团长命令继续前进，士兵们却坐到地上说：“还上那里去！”
    队伍要埋锅造饭，张团长只好命令前卫营等一等，前卫营也不听，先走了，在森林里不知去向！
    饭没吃上，追兵可到了，张团长命令：“打！”士兵们却说：“还打什么！”一连十个“杀”字的连坐法也不灵了，队伍悄悄的滚下山去！
    张团长比部队跑的更快，于是他身边只剩百来个兵，现在他不敢下命令了，他对士兵们哀求：“你们到那山上好不好！”大伙却抄着两手抱枪坐下不动。
    张团长猛喊一声：“我也不想活了！”他满以为这样一喊，部下便感动了，谁知跟他爬上半山的只有一个班零三个兵。
    追兵四面围了上来，这位已经准备作“松江之刎”的团长应该到了高呼“蒋主席万岁”的时候，可是，他未喊出口，他只像兔子一样钻到乱草堆里，终于叫乱枪打死了。
    陪他死在乱草里的，只有一个卫兵。
  　二、“心照不宣”
    前卫营抛下团长在包围圈里单独行动起来，代理营长是团副刘毅福，才到营不几天，摸不透连长们的心事，于是他不叫打也不说投降。
    在阴森森的山林转来转去，三个排忽然不见了，再转两转，几个排又不见了，队伍越掉越少，追击的枪声越来越近。
    刘团副集合队伍，一看只有八十来人，战斗兵还不到一连。
    刘团副召集大家开会说：“现在你们看怎么办吧？”
    机枪连长和他早已心照不宣，于是首先发言：“团副说怎样就怎样！”正巧一颗六零炮弹落到附近，这个会没来得及作出决议，大家就把枪放下了，跟民主联军到老解放区去。
    失散在森林里的蒋军官兵，想不到都陆续来了，刘团副幽默的说：“原来都是心照不宣的！”
  　三、“民主联军也有”
    三个俘虏军官对房东的小孩说：“你看什么，我们不是民主联军吗？”
    小孩说：“不是。”
    俘虏指着自己的绿军装说：“怎么不是。”
    小孩指着他们的船形便帽、束腰军衣，和美国皮靴一件一件的说：“咱们军队没有这号洋帽，没这号洋装，也没这号洋靴！”
    小孩的祖母为了消释俘虏的窘态，喝斥着小孩：“你懂什么，咱军队也有穿这号的！”
    小孩认真的对祖母嚷起来：“那还不是得他们的！”
