Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 16th—The land re-examination struggle in Chahar Province has been fully launched. Since the CPC Jin-Cha-Ji Central Bureau called on the entire region to continue to deepen land re-examination and sent out working groups, the poor farmers in various parts of Chahar Province were extremely delighted upon hearing the news. Before the working groups even arrived, the land re-examination struggle of the farmers in various places had already vigorously developed, launching a full-scale offensive against the feudal remnants of landlords, despots and local bullies who had been doing evil, forming an unprecedented revolutionary movement. The working groups entered Chahar Province and, together with the leading organs of Chahar Province, organized working groups at the provincial, county, and district levels, and went to various places to help and lead the masses' re-examination struggle. Currently, more than a thousand cadres have participated in the working groups. Taking Fenshui and Yi County as key points, they went deep into the villages to absorb experience in order to guide the movement that has already fully unfolded. Up to now, 72 of the 123 villages in Laishui County have entered the re-examination stage, and all 380 villages in Yi County have entered the re-examination stage. The total number of farmers who have taken action in the two counties is more than 150,000. At the same time, farmers in the entire county of Jiyuan, more than 30 villages in the western part of Mancheng, more than 50 villages in Dingxing, and 40 villages in Xushui, rose up one after another to completely eliminate all feudal exploitation.
