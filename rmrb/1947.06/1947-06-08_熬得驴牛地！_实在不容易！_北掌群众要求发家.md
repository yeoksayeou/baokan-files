　　Endured hardship like donkeys and oxen!
    It's really not easy!
    The people of Beizhang demand to prosper
    [Our newspaper, Shahe News] Beizhang has always emphasized sideline occupations over agriculture, but after the emancipation movement last winter, the masses had land and livestock. Not only are they enthusiastic about sideline occupations, but they also value the land. Pang Wang's family received three mu of land last year, and by saving frugally, they bought a crooked ox. By this spring, they had exchanged it twice and turned it into a large, good ox. They also bought a large cart with others. Nie Qingshan, driving the cart he bought for only 40,000 yuan, said with a smile, "If I work for twenty days, I guarantee I can earn back the price of the cart, excluding the ox's feed. After that, it will all be profit." Huai Qunyang was even happier, saying, "In the past, we were 'carts riding people' (when pushing a wheelbarrow, a carrying strap pressed heavily on the shoulders). Now, people are riding carts. Sitting on the cart and cracking the whip, things get done. Singing and shouting, it's so enjoyable. This is true emancipation!" Han Xin, when he arrived in the pen and saw his favorite ox, couldn't help but say to himself, "I can't bear it, I've also tied a big 'ban jiao' (a local term for a big ox) in my own pen." Now he has already exchanged the ox for a good mule. Zhao Mingxing had no choice in the past. In the spring, others looked forward to rain, but he worried whenever it was cloudy, fearing that he wouldn't be able to plow and sow the land without livestock. Using other people's livestock meant waiting for them to finish planting first, and either the land was too dry or it was too late. Anyway, it never went well. He said, "This year, I've been emancipated, and I strained myself to buy a donkey, so I won't have to suffer this hardship when planting in the future." Han Futang said, "Last year, we didn't have livestock, and the land wasn't harrowed well. We planted at the same time as others, but our seedlings didn't emerge evenly, and we suffered a great loss. This year, we received a loan to help buy a livestock. Even though I'm over seventy years old, I still have to work hard for two more years!" From the Lunar New Year to the end of March, the whole village bought fourteen large oxen, and seventeen crooked oxen were exchanged for good oxen. These oxen can mostly pull a plow independently (crooked oxen were also sold to the village). Two donkeys and two mules, and twenty large carts were bought. Currently, the whole village has ninety-eight oxen, fifty-three donkeys, twenty-six mules, and fifty large carts. In addition to transportation, these livestock are used to draw water for irrigation, and all fifty-plus mu of paddy fields have been planted. The dry land near the paddy fields is also planted with cotton by digging wells (digging a pit where the water can flow and using a waterwheel to pump water into it, and people carry water from the pit to spot-plant areas that cannot be irrigated evenly). Everyone did the calculations and initially thought that an average able-bodied worker could cultivate 30.5 mu of land, which scared everyone (in the past, a good worker could only cultivate 20 mu of land). Now that there are more livestock, plowing and sowing are not a problem. They can also accumulate and transport more fertilizer. One cart can carry as much as ten people, saving a lot of labor. It's only busy during weeding, but by organizing women and children, they can get through it. Everyone is not worried and says that as livestock and carts increase, it will be our time to live a good life! (Kui Lin)

　　熬得驴牛地！
    实在不容易！
    北掌群众要求发家
    【本报沙河讯】北掌历来重副轻农，但去冬经过翻身运动，群众有了土地、牲口，不但搞副业劲头大，对土地也重视了。庞望的去年分得三亩地，省吃俭用买下了一个歪牛，到今年春天换了两次，已换成一个大个好牛，并且和别人伙买下一辆大车。聂青山赶着才用四万元买下的车，笑迷迷的说：“我干二十天，除了牛吃以外，保证把车价赚回来，以后就都是长头了。”淮群羊更高兴，他说：“过去咱是车骑人（推小车时，一根盘带压在两个肩上很重），现在是人骑车了，坐在车上把鞭一扬就办了事，唱唱哩，喊喊哩，多痛快，这才是真正翻透身啦！”韩心之一到圈里看见了自己最心爱的牛时，便禁不住自言自语的说：“可熬的我自己圈里也拴上了一个大板角（大牛俗称）。”现在已把牛换成好骡子了，赵明星过去没办法，春天里别人都盼着下雨，他一见阴天就发了愁，怕下了雨没牲口不能犁耩地，用人家的牲口，得先等人家种完了才行，不是垧干了，就是太晚了，反正是闹不好，他说：“今年我翻了身，使了使劲买了一个驴，以后种地可不受这个苦罪了。”韩福堂说：“去年咱没牲口，地没打耙好，和人家一齐种上地，咱的苗没出齐吃了大亏，今年贷款帮助买下一个牲口，别看我已七十多岁了，还要恶干两年哩！”旧历年到三月底，全村买进大牛十四头，歪牛换好牛十七头，这些牛大都能独拉一张犁（歪牛也都卖到本村），买进驴骡各两个，大车二十辆，目前全村已有牛九十八头、驴五十三个、骡子二十六个、大车五十辆。这些牲口除了搞运输外，就是拉水浇地，把五十多亩水地全部下了种，又把挨着水地的旱地，用打翻井办法（把水能流到的地方打一个坑，用水车往进浇水，人从坑内担水点种附近不能平浇的地）点种棉花，大家算了算账，开始认为一个全劳力平均种地三○·五亩，把大家吓住了（过去，一个好劳力只能种二十亩地），现在牲口多了，犁耩地不成问题，又能多积肥、送肥、拉庄稼，一车能顶十个人担，也能省出好多劳力。就是锄苗时着忙，把妇女儿童都组织起来，也能干过来，大家不发愁了，并说以后牲口大车越来越多，可该咱们过好时光哩！（奎林）
