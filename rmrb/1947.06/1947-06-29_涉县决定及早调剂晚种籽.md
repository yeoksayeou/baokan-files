[Reported by this newspaper from Shexian] Shexian convened a meeting of construction assistants on June 19th to study drought prevention and preparedness, and specifically made the following decisions regarding the adjustment of late-season seeds during the drought resistance effort: 1. Divide areas to investigate seeds – Each district can divide villages into several types based on different climates, study which crops can be planted in which seasons, and what is the latest that certain crops can be planted. Conduct a detailed survey and statistics of suitable crop seeds in each type of village, determining how much is lacking and how much is surplus. 2. Prepare for late planting and make adjustments – After the villages conduct investigations, they should immediately carry out adjustments between households. The amount of surplus and shortage of late-season seeds should be reported to the cooperatives, which in turn report to the district federations of cooperatives for district-wide adjustments. If this is still insufficient, report to the county federation of cooperatives for county-wide adjustments or purchases from other counties. The late-season crops currently being prepared in various places include 64 granaries of millet, Xiaohuangcao, Esiniu, Xiaoqinggu, Guanchegu, etc., which can all be harvested in about two months. Corn varieties include Tuli You, Sancaozi, etc., which can be harvested in 60 days. Other crops include broomcorn millet seeds, mung beans, small red beans, buckwheat, and various autumn vegetable seeds. The county federation of cooperatives has already purchased more than 200 jin of vegetable seeds in preparation for adjustments.

　　涉县决定及早调剂晚种籽
    【本报涉县讯】涉县于六月十九日，召开建设助理员会议，研究防旱备荒，对抗旱中如何调剂晚种种籽问题特作如下决定：一、划分区域调查种籽——各区可根据不同气候划分数类型村，研究啥节令能种啥作物，最迟能种啥作物，并将各类型村适宜的作物种籽详细调查统计，缺多少余多少。二、准备晚种，进行调剂——各村进行调查后，立即进行户与户的调剂，晚种剩余多少和缺少多少均汇报合作社，合作社再报给区联社进行全区性的调剂，再不足报县联社，进行全县调剂或向外县购买，各地现正准备的晚种有谷类六十四还仓、小黄糙、饿死牛、小青谷、关车谷等都是两月左右就能收，玉茭类有土里莠、三糙子等六十天就能收，其他有糙黍籽、绿豆、小豆、荞麦各种秋菜籽等，县联社现已购有二百余斤菜籽准备调剂。
