　　Pingding Chengguan Violently Liquidates Farmers, Recovers Thousands of Mu of Land
　　After the training class for farmers in the Chengguan district concluded, the activists and trained masses in each street connected with each other and, two days later, launched a vigorous struggle. Guo Shaofu, a notorious local tyrant and landlord, has bowed his head and confessed under the united struggle of the masses. The other streets have also launched struggles against landlords. Peasants have initially recovered debts of blood and sweat, including more than 1,200 mu of land, over 500 bundles of possessions, 67 jin of silver ingots, as well as silver dollars, grain, and foreign cloth and silk. The fruits of the struggle are now being distributed, and further struggles are being prepared. (Shengrong, Xiufeng)
　　[Our Newspaper, Tangyin News] The poor workers, peasants, and citizens of Tangyin Chengguan have launched a violent and rapid transformation struggle. Of the fourteen streets in the entire Chengguan area, only ten (East Street, Merchant Street) and eleven (East Gate) have not yet taken action. The other twelve streets have launched a campaign of grievance and reasoning followed by liquidation and struggle against thirty-two tyrannical landlords with 150 mu of land or more. According to preliminary statistics from eight streets, twenty-four tyrannical landlords have returned 6,400 items of clothing, 240 quilts, 1,200 zhang of homespun cloth and foreign cloth, 36,000 jin of grain, 1,100 pieces of furniture, 21 head of livestock, and nine large carts to more than 500 poor laborers and citizens. The masses of all fourteen streets have organized their own associations of the poor. (Fucang)
　　[Our Newspaper, Xiuwu News] Houyue Village in the Third District of Xiuwu responded to the call of "reaping wheat on one hand, struggling on the other" during the wheat harvest, reaping wheat during the day and brewing struggle at night. At first, the masses did not dare to speak out. With the support of the leadership, the masses exposed the evils of the traitorous and tyrannical landlord Zhao Chengwen. He imposed usurious loans during famine years, did not contribute his share as a local leader, and over-allocated expenses to the masses. Last year, when the enemy occupied Majie, he frequently sent intelligence and led the enemy to the village to plunder several times, taking away two head of livestock and a large amount of property. He threatened the families of our militiamen, forcing the militiamen to defect, and killed the militia captain. He often said to the masses through clenched teeth: "The heavens may change! You can complain again." At the assembly, the masses poured out their grievances, and the venue was filled with weeping. The masses unanimously demanded the return of debts of blood and resolved to execute the evil tyrant Zhao on the spot. At this time, an old woman approached the corpse, pointed at it viciously, and said: "Didn't you say the heavens would change? The heavens have truly changed! They have become ours!" Eliminating a great evil has greatly pleased the people. On the spot, two young people requested to join the militia. (Buyun, Jinliu)
