Xinhua News Agency, Central China, Urgent Telegram, 14th. A reporter from the Central China Branch recently analyzed the victory of the military and civilians of Nantong and eight other counties in resisting the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's "rigid suppression," stating: The Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime's rigid suppression is a more desperate and vicious struggle-like offensive, combining "joint suppression," "search and suppression," and "stationed suppression." It invested all of the 49th Division, the 102nd Brigade of the Reorganized 4th Division, and the 19th Brigade and 55th Regiment of the 83rd Division (originally the independent regiment of the First Pacification Zone, reorganized from the puppet Xu Rong's force), along with security forces, totaling 40,000 men. In Rudong and Nantong counties alone, it conducted four large-scale "suppressions" of over 2,000 people in 19 days, with a maximum deployment of five main regiments. In the narrow area of ​​30 miles in diameter in two townships of Jing'an District, Rudong, more than 2,000 soldiers were used, divided into 20 to 30 routes for dense combing and "suppression." Almost all famous villages in the four southern counties of the Haitai line were "suppressed," killing more than 1,500 people and burning more than 2,000 houses. However, the people's will to fight became stronger. In May, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime suffered even worse defeats. The people's armed forces, persisting in the "suppression" zone, seized the initiative from the beginning, using a penetrating tactic to advance into the enemy's heartland. Every victory forced the Chiang Kai-shek army's main force to mobilize, disrupting and bankrupting the "suppression" deployment. For example, on the 12th, the Liu (Bridge) Shi (Port) line, 30 miles northeast of Nantong city, recovered three strongholds in the streets, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek army's main force, which was conducting a "full search and suppression" in the Tongru coastal area, to retreat in panic. On the 22nd, in the battle of Bijia Town on the north side of the Tonghai Highway, more than 90 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were annihilated, which again caused the Chiang Kai-shek army "jointly suppressing" Rudong to quickly move south. On the 30th, in the Lingdian battle, with only five slightly wounded, more than 500 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers were annihilated, and five towns, including Lingdian, Qilin, Yuelai, Xinbei, and Twelve Mounds, were captured, forcing the 102nd Brigade, which was far away in Taixing and Taixian for "suppression," to rush to rescue. In May, the military and civilians of the eight counties annihilated a total of 1,340 Chiang Kai-shek puppet soldiers and captured 66 light and heavy machine guns and carbines, and more than 500 long and short guns. Not only was the original land of the Tongruhaiqi area ensured, but the front was also expanded. On the other hand, the mass self-defense movement showed greater organization and scale in the life-and-death struggle to defend the summer harvest. Six thousand people in Huangxia Township, on the edge of Taixian County, marched deep into the Chiang Kai-shek-occupied area, and Chiang Kai-shek's military and political personnel fled in panic. The masses in Rudong universally organized armed work teams, organizing 85 percent of the total township labor force. Even in the Fengli Town area, which was "heavily garrisoned" by the enemy, more than 20,000 people rushed to harvest all night under armed cover, completing 50,000 mu in three days. The reporter concluded: The heroic military and civilians of Tong, Ru, and other eight counties have persevered victoriously for eight months, not only containing 30,000 to 40,000 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops and annihilating more than 6,000 of them, but also further expanding the scale of the struggle and continuously improving the art of struggle. The major victory in May is good evidence. Starting in June, the enemy will launch another desperate and vicious struggle; but the people will surely be able to independently and persistently persevere until the victorious counter-offensive.

　　南通等八县军民
    胜利破敌“硬性清剿”
    【新华社华中十四日急电】华中分社记者顷分析南通等八县军民反蒋伪“硬性清剿”之胜利称：蒋伪的硬性清剿是一种更穷凶恶极的挣扎性进攻，将“会剿”、“搜剿”、“驻剿”三者结合，投入兵力有四十九师全部，整四师一零二旅及八十三师十九旅五十五团（原将第一绥区独立团伪徐容部改编）连向保安队等达四万人，仅在如东、南通两县十九天内即进行四次二千人以上的大“清剿”，最多出动主力五个团。如东景安区两个乡方圆三十里的狭窄地区就曾用二千多兵力，分二三十路密集篦梳“清剿”。海泰线南四县有名村庄几全剿过，杀群众一千五百余人，烧民房二千余间。但人民斗志益坚，五月份蒋伪败得更惨，坚持在“清剿”区内的人民武装，一开始就夺取主动，以穿心战术，向敌心腹地进军，每次胜利都逼使蒋军主力调动，“清剿”部署紊乱破产。如十二日在南通城东北三十里之刘（桥）石（港）线恢复在市街等三据点，使“全面搜剿”通如滨海地区之蒋军主力仓惶撤兵。二十二日，通海公路北侧毕甲镇一战，歼蒋军九十余，又使“会剿”如东蒋军迅速南调。三十日灵甸一役，以轻伤五名歼蒋伪五百余，连下灵甸、麒麟、悦来、新北、十二堆五镇，迫使远在泰兴、泰县“清剿”之一零二旅急奔救援。五月内，该八县军民共歼蒋伪一千三百四十名，缴轻重机枪、卡宾枪六十六挺，长短枪五百余支。不但确保了原有土地通如海启地区，而且扩大了阵地。另一方面，群众自卫运动在保卫夏收的生死斗争中，表现的更有组织和更大规模。泰县边沿区黄夏乡六千群众，深入蒋占区游行，蒋记军政人员望风逃遁。如东群众普遍组织武装伴工队，组织全乡劳动力达百分之八十五。即敌“重点驻剿”的丰利镇周围，亦在武装掩护下，二万余众彻夜抢割，三天完成五万亩。记者结语称：通、如等八县英勇军民，已胜利坚持八个月了，不仅牵制三、四万蒋伪军，歼其六千余人；而且斗争规模更趋扩大，斗争艺术不断提高，五月的重大胜利就是很好的证据。六月开始，敌人又将进行其穷凶极恶的挣扎进攻；但人民一定能独立长期的坚持，直到胜利反攻。
