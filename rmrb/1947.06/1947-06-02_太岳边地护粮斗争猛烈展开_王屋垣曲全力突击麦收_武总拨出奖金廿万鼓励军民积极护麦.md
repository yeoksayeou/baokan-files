　　[This newspaper Taiyue 31st dispatch] The struggle to protect grain and secure the wheat harvest has fiercely unfolded in various counties of the Taiyue border region. After Wangwu districts convened meetings of over 700 village cadres and activists from the 14th to the 20th, all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women from the villages along the dozens of miles of river defense line have been organized to rush the wheat harvest. The 2,000 mu of barley in Yao Village has been completely harvested. In Rui Village, 40 able-bodied men, 65 semi-able-bodied men, and 230 able-bodied women have organized ten mutual aid groups to rush the harvest, and from the 16th to the 18th, they harvested 200 mu of barley in three days. Currently, Wugou, Guanyang, and Changquan in Rui Village have started harvesting wheat, and it is expected to be completed within five days. Villages such as Xiyang and Dongyang have proposed "Three days to clear the fields, five days to clear the threshing ground," launching a campaign to establish meritorious service in defending the summer harvest. Militia, in coordination with the rotation combat teams, are advancing towards Yuanqu, monitoring the enemy. The grain protection struggle in Yuanqu is also constantly winning victories. The militia in the first district repelled Chiang's troops twice on the 17th and 18th, who were trying to loot grain from the city, killing four enemies. The Hongtong Command, after leading the farmers of 106 villages throughout the county to complete land reform, recently issued instructions to make every effort to protect the wheat harvest, calling on the hero of killing the enemy, the hero of explosion, and the militia field team to play the role of "local tiger," with villages competing and everyone comparing merits, not allowing the enemy to loot even a grain of food. After this call was issued, the militia actively launched a grain protection struggle. The militia team led by the hero of killing the enemy, Zhang Bofu, repelled the enemy's three grain-looting activities from the 17th to the 19th, killing and wounding 11 enemies.
　　[This newspaper Taiyue 1st dispatch] The Chiang-Yan troops in Hongtong are preparing to frantically loot grain. On the 17th, they convened a meeting of the Field Grain Office, the Police Bureau, and the intelligence group, deciding to levy 1.28 dou of wheat for every tael of silver, and 10 sacks for every li, and forcibly conscripted young and middle-aged women around the city for training to form a grain-looting team. Two platoons of the fifth company of the second battalion of the 89th Regiment of the Chiang army have forcibly levied five shi of wheat from each of the eight villages, including Yangxie. In order to smash this arrogant attempt by the enemy, our Shang Qingfu flying demolition team has installed 64 landmines and is preparing to depart. The women have also prepared more than 1,200 detonators, and the men and women are actively preparing to defend the wheat harvest.
　　[This newspaper Taiyue 31st dispatch] The Taiyue Military Commission General Association has allocated 200,000 yuan as a grain protection bonus and called on the border militia to defend the wheat harvest. The call pointed out: (1) The border militia should be organized in a timely manner on the basis of the victory of the second enemy annihilation competition, and carry out the struggle to protect the wheat harvest in a planned manner, resolutely crack down on the enemy's grain-looting troops, and not allow the enemy to loot a single grain of food. (2) Where it is estimated that the enemy may set up temporary grain-looting strongholds, large minefields and mine areas should be laid out, joint defense should be strengthened, and the enemy should be actively attacked to break their grain-looting plan. In places where the enemy has already set up temporary strongholds, they should be sealed off with explosions to compress the enemy within the strongholds and prevent them from coming out easily. (3) The border militia should implement the combination of labor and military affairs, holding a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other, and combine with the masses to organize a rush harvest. (4) Not only should they actively fight during the wheat harvest to ensure the wheat harvest, but they should also actively carry out the grain protection struggle after the wheat harvest has passed. Not only should they not allow the enemy to loot grain from the fields, but they should also not allow the enemy to loot the threshed grain, and they should also seize grain back from the enemy's hands.

    【本报太岳一日电】洪洞蒋阎军准备疯狂抢粮。十七日曾召集田粮处警察局谍报组会议，决定每两粮银征派小麦一石二斗八升，每闾征十条麻袋，并在城周强抓青壮年妇女集训，组成抢麦队。蒋军八十九团二营五连两个排，已强向羊獬等八村各派征小麦五石。为粉碎敌此一狂妄企图，我尚清富飞行爆炸队已装好地雷六十四个，准备出发，妇女亦已做好雷管一千二百余个，男女群众均积极准备保卫麦收。
    【本报太岳三十一日电】太岳武委总会拨款二十万元作为护粮奖金，并号召边地民兵保卫麦收。号召中指出：（一）边地民兵应在第二次歼敌竞赛的胜利基础上及时的组织起来，有计划的开展保卫麦收斗争，坚决打击敌人抢粮部队，不让敌人抢走一颗粮食。（二）估计敌人可能扎临时抢粮据点的地方，应大布雷阵雷区，加强联防，积极打击敌人，打破其抢粮计划。在敌已扎临时据点的地方，以爆炸封锁，把敌人压缩在据点以内，不让其轻易出来。（三）边地民兵应实行劳武结合，一手拿枪、一手拿镰，结合群众组织抢收。（四）不仅在麦收时积极战斗，保证麦收，即在麦收已过也应积极进行护粮斗争。不但不让敌人从地里把粮食抢去，打下的粮食更不让敌人抢走，而且要向敌人手里夺回粮食。
