Masses in Thirty-Six Villages of Ci County and Linzhang
    Execute "Living Yama" Wang Zhenjiang

    [Our Newspaper, Ci County] The masses in the Third District publicly tried the traitors Wang Zhenjiang and Sun Xuezhong in Beixianwang Village, a model village for laying a good foundation. Wang Zhenjiang is from Beixianwang Village, 30 years old. Before the July 7th Incident, he was a bandit who kidnapped and committed violence everywhere. After the incident, he immediately set up a bureau to collect grain and money, so that the masses had to give him half of the grain they harvested each year. After the Japanese surrendered, he went to the south bank of the Zhang River to become a plainclothes captain for the big traitor Wang Ziquan. The masses in the villages on the south bank of the Zhang River called Wang Zhenjiang the "Living Yama." Sun Xuezhong is from Hongshan Village, 31 years old. Before the incident, he was a local ruffian. After the incident, he followed Wang Zhenjiang as a henchman. In 1946, he recruited two companies of soldiers for the big traitor Sun Dianying in Tangyin, and then returned to work for Wang Zhenjiang as a plainclothes team, constantly shooting black guns, kidnapping, and demanding money from villages on the north bank of the Zhang River, making it impossible for the masses to survive and daring not to rise up and overthrow the landlords. When our army liberated Cuijiaqiao, it captured the traitors Wang Zhenjiang and Sun Xuezhong and sent them back to Beixianwang Village to be dealt with by the masses. On May 23, a public trial and accusation meeting was held in Xianwang Village, attended by more than 2,500 people from 36 villages. Before the accusation meeting, a meeting was held to support the masses, so the masses were very enthusiastic when making accusations. Over the years, Wang Zhenjiang and Sun Xuezhong killed more than 30 people with black guns. The masses demanded revenge for their parents and brothers. They recounted one by one the facts of Wang and Sun defrauding the people of their wealth, raping women, and oppressing the masses. The anti-traitor accusation reached a climax. Everyone demanded local execution. The governments of the Third District of Ci County and the Sixth District of Linzhang jointly decided to respond to the demands of the masses and immediately tied Wang Zhenjiang and Sun Xuezhong to the execution ground and executed them by firing squad.

    [Our Newspaper, Ci County] After the Ci County Capture Team brought back the extremely wicked big traitor and bandit leader Guo Yukun from Cuijiaqiao in Anyang, the masses in the Ninth District were very excited. More than 20 villages asked the government to uphold justice for the people and hand him over to the masses to deal with. On May 21, the government handed the prisoner over to the Lucunying people for public trial. On that day, 1,560 people attended the meeting. Everyone was indignant, making accusations and seeking revenge. Ya Jian Miaokun said: Why did you kill several members of my family? Zheng Jilin, the son of Zheng Butang from Houchao Village, in order to avenge his father, held a knife behind his back and pointed at Guo Yukun and said: Why did you kill my father? Tell me! Then the old mother of Han Yonglu, the former deputy district chief of the Ninth District from Nanguo Village, said: What hatred or grievance did my child have against you that you beat him to death and confiscated all the things in my family? You are so cruel! The grievances were endless, and the more they were told, the more hatred there was. The masses demanded that the government uphold justice for the people and eliminate the scourge. The government satisfied the demands of the masses, announced Guo Yukun's crimes, sentenced him to death, and executed him immediately. (Zhi Cheng, Zhao Ming, Yu Xi)
