Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, June 17th: Commander of the East China People's Liberation Army, General Chen Yi, received Yang Gu, the brigade commander of the New 13th Brigade of the Chiang army's 72nd Division (Note: This division was originally the unit of the Sichuan army under Wang Lingji), and Li Jingyao, the brigade commander of the 34th Brigade of the same division, in a certain place on the front line on the 8th of this month after the Tai'an Campaign. Yang is from Nanchong, Sichuan, and was a classmate of General Luo Ruiqing at Shunqing Middle School. He frequently inquired about General Luo's recent situation in Jin-Cha-Ji. Li is from Wenjiang, Sichuan. In 1916, he studied at Huayang Middle School in Chengdu, at which time General Chen Yi was also studying in Chengdu. They reminisced about the past and had a very pleasant conversation.

General Chen Yi inquired about the situation of the Sichuan military and political affairs and the people's lives, which he had been away from for a long time. Yang was extremely indignant when recounting the history of the Sichuan army being divided and eliminated by Chiang Kai-shek. He said: "Only nine armies of the Sichuan army are left, and they have all been scattered by Chiang in various war zones, making it difficult for them to act alone. All the Sichuan army generals are looking forward to returning home and being buried in their homeland. The circumstances of Liu Xiang's death are still unclear, and there are still suspicions. In short, Sichuanese who work for Chiang have no good end. There is even less future in fighting a civil war. If Chiang wins, we will not have a place; if Chiang loses, we will be the first to be sacrificed." Li used to be the adjutant general of Hu Zongnan's headquarters. General Chen Yi inquired about the situation after Hu Zongnan's attack on Yan'an, and Li replied: "Hu Zongnan's army has not fought for many years and lacks combat experience. Hu himself knew early on that the attack on Yan'an would fail, but he still ventured to attack." When talking about the annihilation of Chiang's 72nd Division, Li said: "Our headquarters was ordered to hold Tai'an, and the superiors said that the siege could be lifted in three days. As a result, the 85th Division and the 75th Division were only a day's journey away, but they did not show any intention of rescue, and were therefore annihilated. Of course, reinforcement would only mean sacrificing a few thousand more troops."

General Chen Yi finally advised Yang and Li to recall the history of their involvement in the army for more than 20 years, to examine and recognize the trend of the people's era, and to liberate themselves from Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial and autocratic deception.

　　杂牌军替蒋送死下场如此！
    川军被分化消灭殆尽
    七十二师川籍将领痛述往事
    【新华社华东前线十七日电】华东人民解放军司令员陈毅将军，于本月八日在前线某地接见了泰安战役中放下武器的蒋军七十二师（按：该师原为川军王陵基所部）新十三旅旅长杨固及该师三十四旅旅长李净尧。杨氏为四川南充人，曾与罗瑞卿将军同学于顺庆中学。他对在晋察冀的罗将军频问近况。李氏为四川温江人，民国五年在成都华阳中学求学，彼时适陈毅将军亦在成都就学，彼此回忆往事，纵谈甚欢。
    陈毅将军对久别的四川军政情形及人民生活状况，多所询问。杨氏在历述川军被蒋介石分化消灭的历史时，极为愤慨。他说：“川军现仅剩下九个军，均被蒋编散在各战区，孤掌难鸣。川军将领均盼望早日回家，埋骨故土。对刘湘死况不明一节，至今怀疑。总之，四川人在蒋方做事的，没有一个有好结果。打内战更无前途。如蒋胜利，不会有我们；如蒋失利，我们更是首先被牺牲的工具。”李氏曾任胡宗南总部副官长。陈毅将军询以胡宗南进攻延安以后的情形，李氏答说：“胡宗南军队多年不打仗，缺乏战斗经验。胡本人早知道攻延安必失败；但终于冒险进攻。”谈及蒋军七十二师被歼，李氏说：“本部奉命固守泰安，上峰谓三日即可解围。结果八十五师、七十五师虽相距仅一天路程，竟无援救表示，因而被歼。自然，增援也不过是多断送几千部队而已。”
    陈毅将军最后劝杨、李二氏回忆二十多年干军队的历史，好好检讨认识人民时代的潮流，应从蒋介石独裁专政的欺蒙下解放自己。
