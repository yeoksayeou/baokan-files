　　Annihilate the Enemy and Puppet Troops Looting Grain
    Yexian Militia Achieve Victory
    [Report from this newspaper, Yexian] Since our army transferred its positions in Yexian, the enemy has taken the opportunity to loot our border areas. Our Second District, in order to protect the masses in the border areas during the wheat harvest, specially organized armed forces to conduct activities in the border areas. On the dawn of the 6th of this month, Wang Ziquan, Guo Qing, and remnants of the Homecoming Corps, totaling about 200 people, came to Chenjiaying in our area to loot wheat. They happened to encounter Comrade Li Shutian from our Second District leading a militia unit to protect the grain in the village. They immediately engaged the enemy in a fierce battle. Hao Yuqi, director of the Second District Armed Forces Committee, also rushed to assist in the battle upon hearing the news. Comrade Du Bao from our Second District fired two bursts with a machine gun, killing and wounding two enemies. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the enemy fled in disarray. Our militia suffered no casualties. This battle fired the first shot of victory in the protection of the wheat harvest.
