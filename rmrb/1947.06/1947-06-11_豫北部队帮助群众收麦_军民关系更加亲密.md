　　Yubei Troops Help the Masses Harvest Wheat
　　Strengthening the Intimate Relationship Between the Military and the People
　　[This newspaper's Yubei Front, 7th dispatch] This newspaper's reporter Ke Gang reports: The People's Liberation Army's 64th unit is helping the masses in the newly liberated area of Ye County (east of Anyang) harvest wheat. According to statistics from the unit's direct subordinate teams alone, they have harvested over 400 mu of wheat in the past two days. While helping with the harvest, they have earnestly ensured continuous wheat cutting, continuous propaganda, not eating the masses' food, not drinking water, not smoking, leaving early and returning late, and not missing a single poor peasant's home. Through our army's assistance, the majority of the masses have shattered the past deceptive propaganda of the Chiang Kai-shek pseudo-regime and have become more affectionate towards our army. They fully realize that the People's Liberation Army is the people's own army. The mother of middle peasant Bai Zhiyi said, "In this scorching heat, they don't even drink a mouthful of our water, and they cut wheat even faster than our own family. I've lived for over sixty years, and I've truly never seen such an army." When the soldiers completely carried his three mu of wheat back home for poor peasant Wei Zhongxian, he specially made sesame seed cakes to ask the soldiers to eat. When the soldiers declined and walked out the door, he anxiously said with tears in his eyes, "Comrades, I know we are one family, what are you afraid of eating a little of your own cake? In the future, we will also fight together to build a new world!"

　　豫北部队帮助群众收麦
    军民关系更加亲密
    【本报豫北前线七日电】本报记者柯岗报导：人民解放军六四部队帮助邺县（安阳以东）新解放区群众收麦。两日来仅该部直属队统计，割麦四百余亩，并在助收中切实做到了不停的割麦，不停的宣传，不吃群众饭，不喝水，不吸烟，早去晚归，不漏掉一家贫农。大部群众在我军助收中，打破了蒋伪已往的欺骗宣传，对我军更加亲热起来。他们完全认识了人民解放军是老百姓自己的队伍。中农白志宜的母亲说：“大热天，连俺一口水也不喝，割麦比俺自家人还割的快，我活这六十多年，可真没见过这队伍呀”。贫农魏忠贤当战士们把他的三亩麦子完全替他扛回去的时候，他特别烙的油饼要叫战士吃，当战士们谢绝走出大门时，他急的含着眼泪说：“同志们，我知道咱是一家人呀，你吃点自己的饼怕啥呢？往后咱们还要一块打天下的呀！”
