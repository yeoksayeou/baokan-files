Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st—Hu Xingyuan, a reporter from the KMT's media delegation to Yan'an, published a dispatch titled "Glimpses of Yan'an" in the Shanghai Joint Evening News in early May. It stated that when they got off the plane and saw the sorry state of Hu Zongnan's soldiers, "they couldn't believe their eyes," because in their imagination, Hu Zongnan's army should be "neatly uniformed, tightly legginged, physically strong, and equipped with excellent weapons." But the Hu Zongnan's soldiers guarding Yan'an were covered in yellow dirt, wearing worn-out military caps, cotton uniforms that had been washed many times with at least five patches. Some were barefoot, some wore broken shoes, with tired faces. The soldiers all said uneasily, "Although these clothes were issued last year, they have been used for several winters. Now that the weather is warm, it was terribly cold before, but what can we do?" The soldiers ate wheat buns without any vegetables, only a bowl of noodle soup as a side dish, so they were all thin and weak. The reporter asked them when the Communist Party could be defeated. They stared blankly for a long time and couldn't answer. Finally, they didn't even dare to look at people, lowering their heads and replacing their answer with a long sigh.

After a thorough scorched-earth policy, Yan'an had become a city without vegetables. The meat and green vegetables eaten by the KMT officers were all brought by plane from Xi'an. Although the KMT army had set up markets in a pretentious manner at the South Gate and Baijiaping, with wooden signs indicating mule and horse areas, grain areas, vegetable areas, chicken and duck areas, and firewood areas, they were just empty spaces.

When the reporter visited the ruins of the "Liberation Daily," he saw only some charred wood and waste charcoal. "It is not difficult to imagine the date of the retreat and the determination of the Communists at the time of their retreat." The reporter described the combination of the Liberation Daily and the masses: "Although the ruins of the Liberation Daily are so desolate, it is still a living entity in the minds of the people of Yan'an. All the old people, women, and children told me: The Liberation Daily reporter had visited them and helped them with production and reading with glorious stories." This newspaper was widely circulated, and there were traces of them posting the newspaper on every street, which shows its influence in the border area." But the reporter also said: Since Hu Zongnan occupied the area, "Yan'an has become a city without newspapers." The reporter praised Yan'an's culture: "In the Central Library of the CCP, which was bombed by KMT planes, although there is not a single book left, the handwriting on the cards shows the breadth of their collection of materials and the precision of their research. Even the indexes of editorials and special articles from obscure newspapers in Chongqing, Kunming, or Shanghai were there. Although Yan'an is closed off, this treasure trove of knowledge is filled with materials from every corner of the vast world." "What is especially unforgettable are the blackboards seen on every street and alley. According to the people, they used to get a lot of new knowledge and life guidance from there." The reporter admired and said: "Looking at Yan'an's culture from the ruins of Yan'an's culture, although we cannot see the full picture of Yan'an's culture in the past, the cultural workers' hard life and pioneering spirit in creating these cultural forms and contents that breathe with the vast number of farmers in this desolate northwest corner of China's cultural wasteland cannot but make us cultured workers who live in comfort feel ashamed."

　　延安胡军面有菜色穿的是破衣帽破鞋
    中外记者团记者报导
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】蒋政府组织参观延安的中外记者团记者胡星原于五月上旬之沪联合晚报发表以“延安点滴”为题之通讯。内称：当他们刚下飞机，见了胡宗南士兵的狼狈相，“就不相信自己的眼睛”，因为他想像中的胡宗南军队，应该是“军装整齐，绑腿笔挺，体躯雄壮，枪械优良”，但眼前守卫延安的胡宗南士兵，是满身黄土，一顶破旧的军帽，下过水的棉军装，至少有五个补绽，有的赤着脚，有的穿着破鞋，带着疲倦的面容，士兵都惴惴地说：“这身衣服虽然是去年才发的，但已用过几个冬天了，现在天暖了，前一个时候冷得要命，可是有什么办法呢？”士兵吃的是麦馒，连菜都没有，只有一碗面汤，算是下饭的菜肴，所以个个都是消瘦不堪。记者问他们共产党什么时候能打得完，他们呆想了半天回答不出。最后他们的眼睛也不敢看人了，低下了头以一声长叹来代替回答。
    在彻底的空室清野后，延安已经成了没有菜的城，蒋军官们吃的肉和青菜都是由西安用飞机带来的，虽然南门、白家坪，蒋军装模作样设有市场，木牌上写着骡马市区、粮食区、蔬菜区、鸡鸭区、柴炭区等，但只是一个空空场子而已。
    当记者参观“解放日报”的遗址时，看到只剩一些焦木和废炭，“不难想见，撤退的日期和当日他们（指共产党）撤退的决心。”记者描写解放日报与群众结合道：“尽管解放日报的遗址如此荒漠，但在延安人的心目中却仍然是一个活的生命，一切老百姓、婆姨、小孩子告诉我：解放日报记者曾访问过他，并且还帮助过他们生产和读书的光荣故事。”这张报纸流传得相当广阔，每个街头还有他们贴报的痕迹，可想她在边区的影响了。”但记者又说：自胡宗南占领该地后，“延安已是无报的城了。”记者盛读延安的文化道：“在被蒋机炸毁的中共中央图书馆中，虽已不留一本书，但从卡片字迹里可以看出他们搜集材料的范围的广阔，和研究的精细。那怕是重庆、昆明或者上海一家并不出名的报纸社论和特稿的索引都有，延安虽然闭塞，但这所知识的宝库，却充满了广大世界每个角落的许多材料。”“尤其不能令人置忘的，是每个街头巷尾所见的黑板报，据老百姓说：过去他们是从那里得到了不少新的知识和生活的指导。”记者叹服说：“从延安的文化废墟看延安的文化，虽然并不能看出昔日延安文化的全貌，但文化工作者在这荒凉的中国西北角文化荒地上的刻苦生活与拓荒精神而创造这些跟广大农民们一同呼吸的文化形式与内容，不能不让我们这些养尊处优的文化工作者感觉到惭愧”。
