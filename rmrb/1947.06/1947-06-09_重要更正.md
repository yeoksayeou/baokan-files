　　Important Correction
    In yesterday's (8th) edition of this newspaper, on the first page, the ninth line from the bottom of the editorial, "universally reduce living standards" was mistakenly printed as "universally reduce production levels." We hereby issue this correction.
    Furthermore: In yesterday's third page, in the news piece "Six Hundred University Professors in Peiping and Tientsin," in the second line, "黎邵熙" should be "黎锦熙," and in the sixth line, "the very source of the crisis" should be "the root cause of the crisis." In the news piece "Italian Workers' Demonstration," in the twelfth line, "workers stop" should be "workers strike."

　　重要更正
    昨（八）日本报第一版社论倒数第九行“普遍降低生活水平”误排为“普遍降低生产水平”，特此更正。
    又：昨日第三版“平津六百大学教授”消息第二行“黎邵熙”应为“黎锦熙”，第六行“危机的很源”应为“危机的根源”。“意大利工人游行示威”消息第十二行“工人停止”应为“工人停工”。
