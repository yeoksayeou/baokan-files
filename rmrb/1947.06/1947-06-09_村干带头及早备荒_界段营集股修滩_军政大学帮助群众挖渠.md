　　【This Newspaper, Cixian News】The Fourth District is located on the north bank of the Zhanghe River. Due to years of flooding, the land was washed into river beaches. More than ten mu were repaired last year. This year, there has been no rain due to the drought. The village cadres of Jieduanying Village led the masses to recall the famine of 1943 and the pain of selling children for food. After discussion by the masses, they decided to repair Heqi Beach. Village cadres took the lead in participating in the leadership and organized two beach reclamation teams. Zhang Qi’s team was composed of old shareholders from last year, with a total of 14 shares and 43 people. More than 20 mu of cotton and more than 20 mu of black beans have been planted, for a total of 80 mu. Liu Xueyu’s team is a new class this year. Participation is completely voluntary, and shares can be freely invested. It is divided into seven groups with 71 people. From the 14th to the 22nd of last month, a canal 600 steps long and 4 feet wide was repaired. On the afternoon of the 22nd, water had entered the field. A total of more than 100 mu of beach land can be repaired. The reasons why this canal repair team can rapidly grow are: first, everyone can voluntarily invest in shares, and some can even have one share for four or five people, investing according to their ability, and also exchange labor. Second, equal value exchange and regular settlement, calculating points based on work, without suffering losses. Settlements are made every half month. It is estimated that if it does not rain again this year, 200 mu of beaches can be repaired. (Xiao Huang)
