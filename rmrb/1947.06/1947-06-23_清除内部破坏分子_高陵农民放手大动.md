　　Eliminating Internal Saboteurs
    Gaoling Farmers Unleash Great Action
    [Our newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch dated 21st] In the newly recovered area of Gaoling, the farmer's internal organization is being clarified, landlords and their relatives are being purged, farmers' worries are being dispelled, and the grain and land distribution movement is being carried out in depth. This movement is being conducted according to the instructions of the county party committee. All districts have carried out cleaning through farmer's congresses. In terms of methods, after mobilization, some bad elements were detained on the spot, and bad elements were cleared out. Some suspected elements also expressed their attitude on the spot and made oaths. After the initial clarification of the organization, the "Speak Bitterness" struggle was successfully launched in each village. Villages in the first, second, and fourth districts that were difficult to mobilize have been stirred up by the "Speak Bitterness" struggle. After the internal organization of Guoxiaozhai Village in the first district was clarified, everyone took an oath to eliminate mutual suspicion. The government "moved out a stone," detaining the local tyrant and landlord Xu Jiucun. During the liquidation, 70 out of 100 households in the village spoke bitterness. At the "Speak Bitterness" meeting, the masses were in tears. When an old woman, Xu Kangshi, recounted how her son (a militia member) and her husband (chairman of the farmers' association) were killed by Xu Jiucun when the Kuomintang troops occupied the area, and Xu Wushen cried out how his entire family of six was killed, the masses were so angry that they rushed forward with bricks, stones, and wooden sticks and beat Xu Jiucun to death. In Dalu Village in the fourth district, floating wealth had been seized twice, and the cadres said, "There's nothing more to seize." However, after the masses clarified the organization and spoke bitterness to the local tyrant landlord, they dug out a cave in the landlord's house. The cave contained a lot of property, as well as several large guns and more than 500 rounds of ammunition. The second district has always been a village with strict feudal rule, but in the "Speak Bitterness" struggle, the masses tore off their masks and, after fighting the landlord, immediately broke open the situation. Now, the democratic government, in order to strongly support the masses and lead the farmers to clarify the organization, has concentrated all the militia and puppet organization personnel who surrendered to the enemy in the district for education, reflection, and repentance. After returning, they express their attitude to the masses and admit their mistakes. In this way, the masses have no worries at all, and their enthusiasm is getting higher and higher. They actively went outside to expose fleeing bad elements. More than 20 people have been arrested in Hua (County) East recently, and a batch of floating wealth has been seized.

　　清除内部破坏分子
    高陵农民放手大动
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】新收复区高陵澄清农民内部组织，清除地主、顽属，解开农民顾虑分粮分地运动深入展开。这一运动是根据县委的指示，各区都经过农民大会进行清理：作法上是经启发动员后，有的当场扣押了坏分子，清出了坏分子，有些嫌疑分子亦当时表明态度，立约宣誓。组织初步澄清之后，各村诉苦斗争，顺利开展，一、二、四区很难发动的村子，在诉苦斗争中群众都动起来了。一区郭小砦村澄清了内部组织，大家盟誓，解除了自己人的互相怀疑后，政府“搬出石头”，将恶霸地主许九存扣押，清算时全村一百户人家有七十户诉苦，在诉苦会上群众声泪俱下，当一老太太许康氏诉及其子（民兵）与其丈夫（农会主席）在蒋军进占时被许九存杀害；许五身哭诉全家六口人被杀绝时，当场群众激愤之下，以砖石木棍一涌而上，将许九存打死。四区大吕庄搞过两次浮财，干部都说：“没啥搞了”。但群众澄清组织，向恶霸地主诉苦之后，又在一家地主家挖出一个地洞，洞内藏着许多财物，并有大枪数支，子弹五百余发。二区一向为封建统治较严密的村子，但在诉苦斗争中，群众撕破脸皮，向地主斗争后，即轰开局面。现民主政府为了大力为群众撑腰，领导农民澄清组织，各村把投敌的民兵伪组织人员全部集中到区，进行教育反省悔过，回去后向群众表明态度，承认错误。这样一来，使群众没有丝毫顾虑了，群众情绪越来越高，他们积极的到外边捣逃亡的坏分子，滑（县）东最近即搞住二十多名，清查出一批浮财。
