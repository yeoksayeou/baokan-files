　　Turned-Over Hero Elected Production Model
    Liang Ma Competes for Merit and Adds More Merit
    Liu Cun
    Liang Madou, a turned-over hero from Taihang, actively responded to the call of the Hero Congress, striving to transform from a turned-over hero into a labor hero. In this year's great production movement, Madou actively led the production movement in Licun Gou. At the Licun Gou production commendation conference, the masses elected Liang Madou as the village's number one model worker. At the district's commendation conference, Liang Madou was elected as the first production model of the Fifth District of Lucheng. Liang Madou made many contributions in this year's spring production:
  I. Resolving the Ideology of Emphasizing Sideline Occupations Over Agriculture
    Last winter, Licun Gou combined land investigation with winter production relatively well. The masses engaged in large-scale transportation, and the money earned from transportation alone bought five mules and three donkeys. Until late April, the fields were full of stubble, and the masses were still vigorously engaged in transportation, not plowing the land. The village chief and deputy village chief took large carts to Handan, with nine livestock pulling coal, saying that pulling coal for one day earned one *shi* of corn. At this time, Liang Madou led the mutual aid team leaders to conduct spring plowing preparation inspections, and found that fourteen groups still had 952 *mu* of stubble land, and the average amount of manure applied was only three carts (last year it was six carts), and the land was only prepared for plowing once, just to avoid leaving it barren. During last year's spring plowing, the masses kept going to Xiangyuan to buy soybean cakes, but this year no one mentioned buying soybean cakes, and many people were preparing to "cut rough millet."
    Liang Madou discovered the masses' ideology of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture, so he convened a mass meeting to discuss "What do we rely on to eat, what do we rely on to prosper?" Initially, most people believed that "We rely on transportation to prosper; one day of transportation earns one *shi* of corn." Those who advocated prospering through transportation said that transportation had four major benefits: 1. It earns more; 2. It comes quickly; 3. The work is easy; 4. The food is good. Liang Madou admitted that transportation could make money and that it came quickly, but he guided the masses to recall the famine years. Old Man Chen Laixi said: "In the third year of the Guangxu reign, there was nothing to eat, and one-third of Licun Gou starved to death. In the thirty-second year, Chen Village earned a lot of money by weaving mats but didn't farm, and later they couldn't buy rice with the money, and 365 people starved to death." Chen Bahai said: "Farming is fundamental; farming is like cultivating life." Liu Guoji said: "Money from business lasts thirty years, but money from plowing lasts ten thousand years." Those who advocated transportation said: "My idea is to buy rice with the money I earn." Liang Madou then calculated accounts with the masses to see whether transportation or farming was more profitable. According to the then-current foot price and rice price, transportation earned only 1.2 *dou* of corn per work day, while farming could yield 1.5 *dou* of corn per work day in an average year. After this calculation, everyone understood and said: The land is a treasure bowl, and farming is fundamental. Each group then made a plan for spring plowing and sowing. All livestock were transferred from transportation to plowing the land. As a result of the spring plowing, 1,984 *mu* of land were plowed twice, 591 *mu* of land were plowed once, and the amount of manure applied was at least six carts per *mu*, with significant progress in deep plowing and careful cultivation compared to last year.
  II. Resolving Knots in Mutual Aid Teams
    In Licun Gou, resolving the knots between cadres and the masses also resolved the knots in the mutual aid teams. Liang Madou first resolved the knots in his own group. Facheng, Quanke, and Xiaotianfu raised opinions: Last year, they plowed wheat land for families without livestock, but they had not been paid wages; during the autumn harvest, they used other people's labor but paid wages. On June 6th last year, after the wheat harvest, the mutual aid teams saved labor and were very happy. They had a joint meal together. Xiaotianfu took out three *dou* of wheat to grind into flour, and Madou took out 1,000 yuan to buy vegetables. The whole group should have contributed, but there was no way to settle the accounts. So they settled the outstanding accounts from the previous year's mutual aid. Xiaotianfu raised an opinion to Huaixi, saying: You're crooked when it comes to heavy work, and you show up for light work. I'm not satisfied if heavy and light work are treated the same. Pang Rou is good at managing the household, he said: I do all the heavy work, and Huaide is afraid to move, yet he gets a wage of three *sheng* of rice a day, which is obviously unreasonable. So they stipulated a method of converting labor. The Qunze Group had knots due to arrangements for daily life. After everyone resolved the knots, they stipulated that this year it would be "one turn per day." After each group resolved the knots, Liang Madou called on people to voluntarily combine. One group disbanded, and several group members individually jumped groups, and two new groups were established. The number of households organized increased from 94 percent last year to 100 percent.
  III. Mobilizing Women and Children to Participate in the Great Transformation of Labor
    Licun Gou has a lot of land but little labor. In addition to the forty laborers from military families, cadre families, merchants, and workers who cannot participate in agricultural labor, there are only sixty male full laborers and twenty-five semi-laborers at home. This spring, two militiamen went to the front lines in northern Henan to participate in the war. Fifty full laborers went to Linxian to transport grain for ten days round trip. Four large carts went to Henan Dian to deliver public grain. Just when they were rushing to sow, fifty-two full laborers left, leaving only eight full laborers and twenty-five semi-laborers at home to sow.
    In order to complete the task of rushing to sow, Liang Madou first convinced his wife, Guo Quanmei, to stop weaving and go to the fields. Quanmei, as the chairwoman of the Women's Rescue Association, took the lead. The village chief also mobilized his wife to go. Obligatory teacher Niu Fawang said that women have small feet and would ruin the land and not be able to do the work. Liang Madou, however, proceeded from a positive perspective and praised Pei Quanmao's daughter-in-law, a woman who was actively working, on the public blackboard broadcast platform. Security Officer Jin Shun organized nine women. Jin Shun drove the shaft, and the women pulled the carts, hauling a total of fifty carts of dry manure and compost. Women pulled plows and plowed nine *mu* of land, and sowed fifty-nine *mu*. The broadcast platform continued to broadcast, and the more they praised, the more enthusiastic they became. When the grain transporters returned, they saw that the land had been sown and the seedlings were being tended. They all said that women are a major force. Fawang's thinking was also cleared.
  IV. Carrying Out the Merit-Earning Movement
    In Licun Gou, the merit-earning movement solved the problem of resentment toward hired laborers during land redistribution, encouraged the enthusiasm and progressiveness of cadres, and encouraged the elderly, women, and children to participate in sowing, and selected new activists.
    During the rectification of relationships, Yong Sheng's daughter-in-law raised an opinion to the village chief, Kui Zhi, saying that Kui Zhi shouted slogans too loudly during the struggle against the landlord, scaring her child. Kui Zhi couldn't understand, thinking that "I can't please the masses," so he drove the livestock to Handan. During the merit-earning movement, the masses voted Kui Zhi as the top hero, but he was one vote short of a mutual aid team leader. Madou said to Kui Zhi: You have made great contributions to production. The masses have discerning eyes; merits cannot be buried. You are one vote short of Pang Rou because your attitude is not good and you drove the livestock to Handan, neglecting the work in the village. Kui Zhi accepted his opinion. And although Madou himself made the top merit, he reviewed himself saying: I don't consider the masses enough. Our village's cooperative is a small shop. The cooperative aims to make more money, and the masses aim to delay. It earned 200,000 yuan in a year, and there are more than 200,000 yuan in outstanding accounts outside. I haven't helped to solve this; it's my fault. Jin Shun used to be lazy, not working in the fields at home, and eating and drinking heavily. Later, he changed and got votes. Jin Le and Wang did not earn merit and stayed in bed at home, not speaking at the meeting. Madou used Jin Shun's example to educate Jin Le and Wang, saying that Jin Shun would not have even received one vote last spring. This spring, he organized women to pull manure and plow the land, and the masses voted him twenty-four votes. The reason Jin Le wasn't elected is because he didn't actively participate in the mutual aid team, only caring about getting rich himself, forgetting the masses. If you didn't get elected this time, look again next time. This time, the masses' evaluation of production models encouraged the cadres' advantages and also approved the cadres' merits. In the process of asking for merit to add to merit, the cadres voluntarily and consciously recognized and overcame their shortcomings. The masses' evaluation is the masses' use of votes to appraise cadres and educate cadres.
    The merit-earning movement mobilized the powerless Qun Ze's father to drive large carts, acting as half a laborer, mobilized the fifty-year-old Lao Zhenxi to carry shoulder poles, and went to sing "Chairman Mao is like the red light on the high mountain" on Xiaoxitian Mountain in Pingshun. It encouraged the fourteen-year-old Pei Xinfang to plow the land for ten days, and encouraged the young child Li Changan to drive the cart to deliver manure. Semi-laborers became full laborers, and sixty women were encouraged and mobilized to go to the fields. The broadcast platform became a powerful propaganda tool for the production merit-earning movement. These latent forces were brought into play. The men delivered public grain and completed sowing. Now they are collectively transplanting seedlings, and the men are drawn out to transport, achieving agriculture, sideline occupations, and participation in the war without any delays. This time, the whole village elected thirty-eight model workers, with eight people earning great merit, four people earning second-class merit, and twenty-six people earning third-class merit. Most of them are activists from the spring's turnaround movement. In the merit-earning process, the masses selected activists, forming a new and large production leadership organization, including eight women and seven children. Everyone discussed earning more merit and brewing the construction of a new Licun Gou, turning the poor gully into a rich gully, and brewing the establishment of a prosperity mutual aid cooperative.

　　翻身英雄当选生产功臣
    梁马斗功上加功
    柳村
    太行翻身英雄梁马斗，积极响应群英大会的号召，争取由翻身英雄变为劳动英雄。今年大生产运动中，马斗积极领导了李村沟的生产运动，李村沟的生产评功大会上，群众选举梁马斗为该村第一功臣，全区功臣大会上，又经大会选举梁马斗为潞城五区第一个生产功臣。梁马斗在今年春季生产中立了许多功劳：
  一、解决重副轻农思想
    去年冬天，李村沟查田与冬季生产结合较好，群众大搞运输，光运输挣的钱，就买了五头骡子三头驴，直到四月下旬，地里尽是茬子，群众还一股劲搞运输，不犁地。村长、村副赶上大车下邯郸，九部牲口拉煤，说是拉一天煤挣一石玉茭。这时梁马斗领导互助组长进行春耕准备检查，发现十四个组还有茬地九百五十二亩，粪土平均只上三车（去年上六车），地只准备犁一遍，不荒就行。去年春耕时群众一直下襄垣买豆饼，今年没人说买豆饼，许多人都准备“割糙谷”。
    梁马斗发现了群众的重副轻农思想，就召开群众大会讨论“靠什吃饭，靠什发家”？最初，大多数人认为“靠运输发家，走一天，赚一石玉茭。”主张运输发家的人说，运输有四大好处：一、挣的多，二、来的快，三、活儿轻，四、吃的好。梁马斗承认运输能赚钱，来的快，诱导群众回想灾荒年，陈来喜老汉说：“光绪三年没吃的，李村沟就饿死三勾有一勾，三十二年陈村打席子挣的多不种地，往后拿上钱量不上米，饿死了三百六十五口”。陈八孩说：“种地为根本，种地如种命”。刘过季说：“买卖钱三十年，犁沟钱万万年”。主张运输的人说：“我的主意是赚了钱就量米”。梁马斗又和群众在一起算账，究竟是运输利大，还是种地利大？按当时脚价和米价算的结果，运输每个工只赚一斗二升玉茭，种地每个工平常年可打一斗五升玉茭，这一算大家通了，都说：地是聚宝盆，种地是根本。各组都订了春耕下种计划。牲口全部从运输调到地里犁地，春耕结果，一九八四亩地犁两遍，五九一亩地犁一遍，粪每亩最低上到六车，圈粪一车，深耕细作上比去年有很大进步。
  二、互助组解疙瘩
    李村沟解干群疙瘩，解着解着就解开互助组疙瘩了，梁马斗首先解自己小组的疙瘩，发成、全科、小天福提出意见：去年他们给没牲口家犁了麦地，还没有给工资；秋收时他们用了别人的工却出了工资。去年六月六，麦收以后，互助省下工，都很高兴，打伙吃了一顿合伙饭，小天福拿出三斗麦子磨面，马斗拿出一千元买菜，应该全组出摊，但没办法算账。他们就清算了去年互助遗留下来的账目。小天福给怀喜提出意见说：重生活你歪了，轻生活你出来了，轻重生活一个样我就不满意。胖肉是好受家，他说：重生活都是我做，怀德怕动弹，一天却是三升米的工资，显着不合理。于是他们就规定了折工的办法，群则组因为安排生活结下疙瘩，大家解开后，规定今年是：“一递一天”。各组解了疙瘩，梁马斗又号召自愿结合，有一个组散了，有几个组组员各别跳了组，又新成立了两个组，组织起来的户数由去年的百分之九十四，发展到百分之百。
  三、发动妇女儿童参战大变工
    李村沟地多劳力少，除军属、干属、商人、工人四十个劳力不能参加农业劳动，在家仅有六十个男全劳力，二十五个半劳力。今春两个民兵去豫北前线参战，五十个全劳力到林县运粮，来回十天，四辆大车下河南店送公粮，正突击下种时走了五十二个全劳力，仅有全劳力八人和半劳力二十五人在家下种。
    梁马斗为了完成突击下种任务，首先打通了他老婆郭全梅的思想，停止织布去上地。全梅是妇救会主席，起了带头作用，村长也动员自己老婆去，义务教员牛发旺说妇女脚小，踏坏了地做不了生活，梁马斗却从积极方面出发，在大众黑板广播台上表扬了积极劳动的妇女裴全猫家媳妇，公安员金顺组织九个妇女，金顺驾辕妇女们拉车，共拉干粪圈粪五十车，妇女拉犁耕地九亩，下种五十九亩。广播台上不断广播，越表扬越起劲，六十个妇女成了当时生产的生力军，运粮人回来一看，地都种上，而且捉住苗，都说妇女就是顶大事。发旺的思想也通了。
  四、开展立功运动
    李村沟在开展立功运动中，解决了整关系的雇差，鼓舞干部积极性和前进心，鼓舞老人、妇女、儿童参加了下种，选拔了新的积极分子。
    整关系时永胜媳妇向村长魁只提了个意见，说斗争地主时魁只喊口号声音太大，吓着了她的孩子，魁只想不通，认为“为群众落不下好”，就赶上牲口下邯郸。立功运动中，群众选评魁只为头号功，但他比一个互助小组长少一票，马斗就对魁只说：你在生产中立下大功，群众眼光明，有功劳埋没不了，你比胖肉少一票，原因一是态度不好，一是赶上牲口下邯郸，放松了村上工作。魁只接受了他的意见。而马斗自己虽然立了头一功，但他自己检讨说：我为群众打算的还不够，咱村的合作社是个小铺，合作社图赚钱多，群众就图拖，一年赚了廿万块钱，外边就有二十多万块钱账要不回来。我没有帮助解决，这是我的不对。金顺原来懒，在家不上地，还大吃二喝，以后转变了，得了选票。金乐和旺二人没有立上功，躺在家不起床，来开会不开口，马斗同金顺的事实教育了金乐、和旺，他说金顺要像前春天连一票都选不上，后春天他组织起妇女拉粪犁地，群众选他廿四票，金乐所以选不上是因为不积极参加互助组，光顾自己发财，忘了群众。这次没选上，下次再来看，这次群众评选生产功臣，鼓舞了干部的优点，同时也批准了干部的功劳。干部在要求功上加功中自愿自觉的认承与克服自己的缺点。群众的评选，就是群众用票数来鉴定干部，教育干部。
    立功运动把无劳力的群则他爹动员起来赶大车，顶半个劳力，把五十多岁的老真喜动员去担扁担，上到平顺高山小西天上唱“毛主席好比那高山红灯。”把十四岁的裴新芳鼓舞起来去犁地十天，把小儿童李长安鼓舞起来赶车送粪，半劳力变成了全劳力，把六十个妇女鼓舞动员到地里去，广播台成了生产立功运动的有力宣传工具。这些潜在的力量发扬起来，男人送公粮，完成了下种，现在都集体拔苗，男人抽出来去运输，做到农、副、参战三不误。全村这次选举了三十八个功臣，有八个人立大功，四个人立二等功，二十六人立三等功。其中大部分是春季翻身运动中的积极分子。立功中群众选拔了积极分子，形成新的大的生产领导机构，其中妇女八人，儿童七人。大家讨论再立功中酝酿建设新李村沟，变穷沟为富沟，酝酿着成立发家互助社。
