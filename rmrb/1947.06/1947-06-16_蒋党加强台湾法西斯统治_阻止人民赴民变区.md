　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th: Shanghai's Ta Kung Pao reported on the recent situation in Taiwan, stating: The Chiang clique is actively "cleansing the countryside" in various "pacification zones" on the island of Taiwan, intensifying the so-called "self-renewal" work, and adopting the method of "sudden household registration checks." Taiwanese people need to obtain "travel permits" to go more than a few dozen miles away (because areas of civil uprising are only dozens of miles away); students must re-register for admission, with photos and guarantors; there are very few students on the streets now. Prices have risen even more sharply than in the mainland, and many people cannot even afford sweet potatoes. Since the Chiang government sent Wei Daoming to govern Taiwan, old subordinate civil servants have been greatly replaced, and many people are trembling for their positions. The vast majority of mainland personnel are afraid of not getting severance pay and starving to death in Taiwan.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Shanghai's Dalu Bao reported: The Shanghai Taiwanese Association has sent a telegram to traitor Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates Zhang Qun and Wei Daoming, protesting the granting of special privileges to Japanese people to immigrate to Taiwan. (Note: Recently, Japan has openly expressed its demand for Japan and the United States to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands and for special privileges to immigrate to Taiwan.)
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to Shanghai's Southeast Daily: Under the betrayal of the Chiang-controlled Guangxi, Guangdong, and Hebei provincial governments, several American companies have obtained special privileges to develop shipbuilding, cement, glass, automobile, and coal industries in these three provinces. These industries require the import of a large amount of American equipment.

　　蒋党加强台湾法西斯统治
    阻止人民赴民变区
    【新华社陕北十二日电】沪大公报报导台湾近况称：蒋党日前在台岛各“绥靖区”积极“清乡”，加紧展开所谓“自新”工作，采用“突击检查户口”办法。台民到几十里以外都须领取“旅行证”（因数十里外即系民变区）；学生则须重新办理入学手续，并要像片和保证人；现在街上很少见到学生。物价上涨较内地尤烈，很多人连红薯也吃不上，自蒋政府派魏道明主台后，旧属公务员大事更迭，许多人都为自己职位战战兢兢，绝大部分内地籍人员都怕得不到遣散费而饿死台湾。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】沪大陆报载：上海台人协会顷致电卖国头子蒋介石及其僚属张群与魏道明，抗议给日本人以向台湾移民之特权。（按：最近日本曾公开表示要求日美共管琉球群岛及向台湾移民之特权。）
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据沪东南日报载：在蒋记广西、广东与河北三省省政府之出卖下，美国若干公司已在该三省获得发展造船、水泥、玻璃、汽车与煤炭等工业之特权，这些工业需要输入大量的美国设备。
