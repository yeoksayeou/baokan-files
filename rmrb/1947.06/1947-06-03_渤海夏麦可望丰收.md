Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 30th—The Bohai Liberated Area is forecasting a bumper wheat harvest. Last autumn, the region had ample rainfall. The Administrative Office provided loans and seeds, supporting farmers in vigorously planting, and the sown area in each county generally expanded by one-third to one time compared to previous years. Currently, the wheat ears are turning yellow and harvesting will begin within half a month. In areas with good soil quality, yields can reach 200 jin per mu, and in less fertile areas, around 100 jin per mu. Guangrao and Boxing counties planted 790,000 mu of wheat, which is expected to increase wheat production by more than 40 million jin compared to previous years. Farmers in various areas are summarizing their spring farming production experience, reorganizing mutual aid teams, and preparing to welcome the new wheat harvest.

　　渤海夏麦可望丰收
    【新华社山东卅日电】渤海解放区小麦预兆丰收。去秋全区雨量充足，行署贷款贷种，支持农民大力抢种，各县播种面积一般较往年扩大三分之一至一倍。目前麦穗已黄，半月内可开镰。地质好者，每亩可产二百斤，次者可产百斤左右。广饶、博兴两县种麦七十九万亩，较往年可增收小麦四千万斤以上。各地农民正总结春耕生产经验，整顿互助、准备迎接新麦登场。
