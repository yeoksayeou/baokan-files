　　In Commemoration of "June 6th" Teachers' Day
    Taihang Administrative Office Calls for Strengthening Regular Education
    [This Newspaper Taihang News] On the occasion of "June 6th" Teachers' Day, the Taihang Administrative Office calls on cultural and educational workers to pay attention to three issues in the merit-making campaign: (1) Veteran cadres who have been engaged in education for many years and have consistently been devoted to education are very valuable in their dedication to the cause. At the same time, attention should be paid to not deviating from the central task. Education must be subordinate to the practical realities of war, emancipation, and production in order to achieve perfection. (2) Practical issues in combining regular education with central education: Regular education is systematic cultural and scientific knowledge. General schools (especially Chinese language education) mainly aim to complete this long-term social construction education. We must not overemphasize central education and neglect regular education, or even mechanically implement "learning by doing," being satisfied with the application of individual matters. It must be understood that schools should focus on culture, and culture should serve political tasks. It is wrong to take culture as the sole purpose of education; it is also biased to take only current practical matters as education. Appropriate combination can further improve the effectiveness of education. (3) How to master social education: Leaders at all levels must clearly understand that social education work mainly serves the central task and is a part of the central task. In the movement, they must participate as propagandists, understand the overall movement, discover the masses' thoughts, use forms that the masses like to see and hear, carry out propaganda and mobilization work, solve the masses' ideological problems, and be good at continuously summarizing, improving, and promoting the educational content and forms, and organize propaganda forces more widely to serve the movement. In addition, the Administrative Office also awarded 100,000 yuan in bonuses to five special districts, and 10,000 yuan in bonuses each to fourteen secondary schools and the two cities of Xingtai and Changzhi, totaling 260,000 yuan, to encourage them.

　　纪念“六六”教师节
    太行行署号召加强经常教育
    【本报太行讯】“六六”教师节，太行行署号召文教工作者在立功运动中注意三个问题：（一）从事教育工作多年的老干部，一贯安心教育工作，这种事业精神是很可宝贵的，同时也应该注意不要脱离了中心工作。教育必须服从于战争、翻身、生产的现实实际，才能做到尽善尽美。（二）经常教育，与中心教育结合上的实际问题：经常教育，是系统的文化科学知识，一般学校（特别是国文教育）就是以完成这种久远的社会建设教育为主要任务，不可过分强调中心教育，而忽略了经常教育，甚至机械的执行“做学教”，满足于一事一物的应用，须知学校要以文化为主，文化要服务于政治任务，单纯以文化为教育，是错误；仅以目前实际为教育，也是偏向，适当结合，方可进一步提高教育的效果。（三）如何掌握社会教育：各级领导必须明确社教工作主要服务于中心工作，是中心工作的一部分，在运动中要以宣传员的资格参加，了解全面运动，发现群众思想，运用群众喜闻乐见的形式，进行宣传鼓动工作，解决群众思想问题，并且要善于把教育内容、形式不断加以总结提高与推广，更广泛的组织宣传力量，为运动服务。此外，行署并给五个专署发奖金十万元，十四个中等学校，邢台、长治两个市，各发奖金一万元，共发二十六万元，以资鼓励。（海如）
