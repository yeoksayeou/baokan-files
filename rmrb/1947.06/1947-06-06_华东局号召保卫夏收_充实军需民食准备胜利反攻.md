　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th. The East China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued instructions on defending the summer harvest. It began by stating: "During this year's summer harvest season, the Chiang army, suffering repeated and serious defeats, will inevitably plunder food from the people of the liberated areas in order to alleviate its food shortage and increase the difficulties of our army and people. Therefore, defending the summer harvest, accumulating strength, preparing for a counter-offensive, laying a material foundation, and guaranteeing military supplies and civilian food have become serious tasks for our Party, government, army, and people. Whether this struggle is valued or not is a serious test of the masses' consciousness and war consciousness." It then called on everyone to overcome all difficulties, victoriously complete the summer harvest assault task, and truly achieve quick cutting, quick threshing, quick drying, and quick storage, without losing or rotting a single grain, in order to achieve the goal of sufficient troops and sufficient food. The requirements are: (1) Mobilize all male and female laborers, old and young, including those with partial labor capacity, to implement labor exchange and mutual assistance; (2) All on-the-job and studying personnel in the Party, government, army, civilian organizations, and schools should help the masses with the summer harvest as much as possible; (3) In combat zones and border areas, all troops, local armed forces, guerrillas, work teams, and militia must organize the struggle against the enemy with maximum strength, resolutely smash the enemy's conspiracy and actions to seize grain, attack "Homecoming Legions," destroy stubborn puppet regimes and all organizational structures, cover the masses in forcibly harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing grain, prohibit aiding the enemy, store grain for war, and implement a combination of labor and military affairs to perform meritorious service for the people. Finally, it pointed out: "Combine the defense of the summer harvest with re-examination and replanting of wasteland, and educate personnel at all levels who are detached from production to struggle against corruption and waste in order to save food and cherish the people's strength."
