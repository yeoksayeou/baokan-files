　　Men, Women, Old and Young, Cheerfully and Enthusiastically Engage in Production from Dawn Till Dusk:
    New Atmosphere of Liberated Peasants in Huguan
    [Report from Huguan by Our Newspaper] After the land reform, the peasants of Huguan are cheerful and enthusiastic about production. Guo Baize, from Qiaoshang Village, Fourth District, is over sixty years old. This year, he was allocated five mu of riverside land, three mu of flat land, and a donkey. He stays up all night feeding his "liberated livestock," constantly patting the "liberated livestock's" rear. When his son went to the front line to join the army, he told him before leaving: "Do a good job on the front line, don't you dare sneak back. If you come back, you'll be letting down the liberation and letting down Chairman Mao." Xiang Shuanggua of Shili Village was chatting with Xiang Tishui while fetching water; Shuanggua asked Tishui, "I have a father, mother, older brother, sister-in-law, relatives, and neighbors, who do you think I am closest to?" Tishui said, "You are closest to the Communist Party." Shuanggua said, "Right! Right! Right! You really guessed it right." Wang Xiaoxin from Nanguan moved into the house he was allocated, with a picture of Chairman Mao in the middle. He has a loom at home, the men till the land and the women weave, the children and daughters go to school. His nine-year-old daughter comes back from school and recites: "Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan are like dogs jumping over a wall, attacking Yan'an..." The whole family talks and laughs, it's very lively. Chen Suoyun didn't use to work, but this year he is very active in production from dawn till dusk. He said, "After liberation, we must have the strength of the liberated." Retired soldier Wang Wansheng stays on the land all day without going home. The women of Shuzhang Shenjiao established a militia class, set up a militia headquarters, transferred colored flags, and stood guard to inspect the shops. The women of Shuzhang established a transportation team, and on May 10th, they carried millet and coal to Hejian Town, ninety li away from their village, to exchange for cotton. The men transporting grain along the way clapped their hands in welcome—all saying, "Heroes! Heroes! These women can truly be equal to men." In Chengnanguan at dusk, the village is filled with singing. Because of the enthusiasm of the liberated peasants, even though 7,000 dan of public grain were transported and 500 sets of stretchers were sent out, the entire county's more than 400,000 mu of land completed planting ahead of schedule. Now, a transportation and second hundred-day textile movement has been launched, and everywhere they are shouting: "Liberated peasants want to be labor heroes, cadres leading the liberation want to add merit to merit. Everything is for the victory of the counter-offensive, uproot the landlords' old roots and achieve complete liberation."

　　男女老幼兴高采烈起早搭黑热情生产
    壶关翻身农民新气象
    【本报壶关讯】土地改革后的壶关农民，兴高采烈，热情生产。四区桥上村郭白则六十多岁了，今年分到河边地五亩，平地三亩、驴一头，他黑夜不睡的在喂自己的翻身牲口，一直摸着“翻身牲口”的屁股，这次他儿到前线参战，临行前他告他儿说：“到前线好好干，不敢偷跑回来，回来了对不住翻身，也对不起毛主席。”十里村向双冠向提水闲谈；双冠问提水说：“我有父、母、哥、嫂、亲戚、邻居，你说我和谁最亲？”提水说：“你和共产党最亲。”双冠说：“对！对！对！你真算猜对了。”南关王小心搬进了自己分到的房子里，中间贴了毛主席像，家里放了织布机，男耕女织，孩子闺女上学校，九岁的小闺女上学回来就念：蒋介石胡宗南狗急跳墙攻延安………全家说说笑笑好热闹。陈锁云过去不劳动，今年起早搭黑生产很积极，他说：“翻身后要有翻身劲。”荣退军人王万生、一天上地不回家。树掌神郊妇女成立了民兵班，设立民兵队部，转运彩号，站岗查店。树掌妇女成立了运输队，五月十号担了小米和煤炭到离他村九十里的合涧镇换棉花，一路上运粮的男人拍手欢迎—都说：“英雄！英雄！这妇女真能和男人平等。”城南关傍晚，一进村一片歌声。由于有了翻身农民的热情，因此在春耕下种中，虽然运了七千石公粮，出了五百付担架，但全县四十余万亩土地，提前完成了下种。现已开展了运输及第二个百日纺织运动，到处都呼喊着：“翻身农民要当劳动英雄，领导翻身的干部要功上加功。一切为反攻胜利，刨了地主的老根大翻身。”
