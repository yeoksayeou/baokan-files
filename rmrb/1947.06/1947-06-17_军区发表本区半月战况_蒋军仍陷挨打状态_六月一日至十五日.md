The Chiang Kai-shek troops around our region continue to be in a completely passive defensive posture. Since May, they have been playing three tricks: first, making empty threats; second, focusing on key defense points; and third, adjusting river defense deployments.

First, on the battlefields of Hebei-Shandong-Henan and northern Henan, the Chiang Kai-shek troops, repeatedly defeated, have long been like startled birds. They cannot launch large-scale strategic offensives like they did after July of last year; nor can they advance north from the Longhai Railway and make strategic defensive counter-attacks in southwestern Shandong like they did after February of this year; they cannot even move north along the Pinghan Railway to relieve the siege of Anyang like they did in April of this year. Now, Chiang Kai-shek's only recourse is to clamor in words about "large armies moving north to relieve the siege of Anyang," but in reality, his only field army corps in northern Henan—Wang Zhonglian's 26th Army—can only hover between Qi and Ji, acting as a mobile guard for Xinxiang, and dare not harbor any rash thoughts.

In western Shanxi, after our army continued to recover Xiangling and Hongdong on the 4th of this month, Linfen became completely isolated. Although at the end of May, they spread rumors of using five or six brigades to open up the section towards Punan, they also used small groups of enemies from Shanxian and Hancheng to intrude into areas near Pinglu and Yumengkou for tentative harassment; the enemy in Yuncheng invaded Jiexian to the south, providing remote support. However, except for Jiexian, they were successively driven away by us, and western and southern Shanxi still ensure our victorious situation.

Apart from using the 30th Division to defend the isolated city of Linfen, the 40th Division trapped in the isolated city of Anyang, and a total of four regiments from parts of the 206th Division, the Whole 10th Division, and the Whole 17th Division trapped in Yuncheng, and the main force of the 26th Army defending Xinxiang and Jixian, the Chiang Kai-shek troops have not sent a single soldier to reinforce and reorganize the battle line, and can only beg for help from the Yellow River. On the long Yellow River line, stretching from Yumengkou in the west to Jinan City in the east, they have deployed a total of about thirteen and a half brigades: two and a half brigades of the Whole 10th Division, one brigade of the 206th Division, one and a half brigades of the 47th Division, one and a half brigades of the 38th Division, two brigades of the 68th Division, three brigades of the 55th Division, and two brigades of the 73rd Division. These thirteen and a half brigades are just remnants of defeated soldiers, relying on the Yellow River for defense, but the "Great Wall" never gave Qin Shihuang any help, and the Yellow River will not bring any benefit to Chiang Kai-shek either. On the contrary, our army in Yu-Wan-Su has penetrated south of the New Yellow River, captured the two cities of Shenqiu and Linquan in one night, and advanced victoriously towards northwestern Anhui and southeastern Henan, traversing the vast areas of Xiangcheng, Runan, and Taihe as if entering an uninhabited land. This is a powerful response to Chiang Kai-shek's playing with the Yellow River.

### 军区发表本区半月战况  蒋军仍陷挨打状态  六月一日至十五日

　　军区发表本区半月战况
    蒋军仍陷挨打状态
    六月一日至十五日
    本区周围蒋军，继续处于完全被动防御的态势，五月以来，正在扮演着三种把戏：第一是虚张声势，第二是重点守备，第三是调整河防布署。
    首先在冀鲁豫、豫北战场上，一败再败的蒋军，早成惊弓之鸟，不但不能像去年七月以后那样的作大规模的战略性进攻；而且也不能像今年二月以后那样，从陇海线北进，再作鲁西南诸城作战略防御性的战役反扑；甚至还不能像今年四月那样，沿平汉线北上以图解安阳之围。现在蒋介石唯一办法，是在口头上叫嚣“大军北上，解安阳之围”，但实际上他在豫北的惟一野战兵团——王仲廉的二十六军，却始终只能徘徊于淇汲之间，替新乡作外围的移动警戒，不敢稍存蠢动之念。
    晋西南方面，本月四日，我军继续收复襄陵、洪洞之后，临汾更是完全孤立。五月末虽曾一面散布以五六个旅兵力打通向蒲南段的谣言，一面以陕县、韩城等地之敌小股侵入平陆及禹门口附近地区，作试探性袭扰；运城之敌则南侵解县，遥为声援。但除解县外，均相继为我驱逐，晋西晋南仍确保我胜利的态势。
    蒋军除了以三十师因守临汾孤城，四十师困守安阳孤城，二零六师、整十师、整十七师，各一部兵力共四个团，困守运城，二十六军主力守备新乡、汲县之外，迄无一兵一卒增援，以重整战线，只得乞灵于黄河。在西起禹门口东迄济南城下的漫长的黄河线上，摆下了整十师两个半旅、二零六师一个旅、四十七师一个半旅、三十八师一个半旅、六十八师二个旅、五十五师三个旅、七十三师二个旅，共约十三个半旅的兵力。这十三个半旅都只是些残兵败将，依托黄河进行守备，但是“万里长城”绝不曾给秦始皇以任何帮助，黄河对蒋介石亦并无任何裨益。相反的，豫皖苏我军则深入新黄河以南，一夜之内运克沈丘、临泉两城，乘胜向皖西北、豫东南挺进，纵横项城、汝南、太和广大地区，如入无人之境。这就是给蒋介石玩弄黄水的有力答复。
