[From our front in Northern Henan, 7th] New Soldiers Learn Eagerly, Skills Improve Rapidly
[This dispatch from our front in Northern Henan, 7th] Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng help and love each other. With the caring assistance of veteran soldiers, new soldiers' skills are rapidly improving. New soldiers tell veteran soldiers about their stories of liberation and the enthusiastic farewells from the masses when they joined the army; veteran soldiers introduce their own battle stories and experiences, and in addition to mutual assistance in life, veteran soldiers also explain the mass discipline and battlefield discipline of the troops to the new soldiers. Veteran soldiers of the 7th Company of the 46th Unit also help new soldiers learn to read every day. In military learning, veteran soldiers, in addition to working hard to train themselves, also actively help new soldiers improve their skills. In a certain unit's machine gun company, in addition to daily drills, they also help new soldiers learn aiming, bayonet fighting, and various movements. Veteran soldier Chen Yongfu first helps new soldiers dig fortifications in battle, and then digs his own fortifications. New soldier Zhu Changfu writes his daily achievements in helping others and the achievements of veteran soldiers helping him on the door bulletin board. In the first battle of Bin Zi Unit's 4th Company, new soldier Yang Yongjin united and helped each other with veteran soldiers, obeyed orders, and completed the task of building fortifications, and received praise four days after joining the army. With the help of veteran soldiers, after five days of learning, the average shooting score of new soldiers in the 4th Company of a certain unit increased from two rings to five rings. New soldier Liu Lishun of the machine gun squad hit 19 rings with three shots. New soldier Zhao Baisheng increased his grenade throwing distance from 29 meters to 37 meters.
[This dispatch from our front in Northern Henan, 7th] Our reporter Ke Gang reports: The People's Liberation Army's 64th Unit warmly welcomes new soldiers in the trenches. The famous hero platoon leader Ren Xiaoxiang specially convened a meeting of the entire platoon to discuss how to welcome the new soldiers before they arrived. They decided to dig a beautiful air-raid shelter for each of them before the new comrades arrived, and to truly care for them in life and patiently teach them combat skills. After studying for a considerable period in the replenishment regiment, the new soldiers quickly mastered the actual combat movements after arriving at the front. Comrade Wang Fusheng of the 3rd Squad of the 9th Company saw that the new comrades' quilts had not yet been received when it was dark, so he quickly took his own quilt and gave it to them to cover themselves. Ran Qingshun saw that the new comrade Zhang Yutang's shoes were broken, and immediately took his own new shoes and gave them to him to wear. Veteran soldiers of the 9th Squad of the 8th Company and the 6th Squad of the 7th Company have all automatically made plans to help the new comrades. Lu Sibao's plan is: 1. Guarantee not to quarrel with the new comrades; 2. Let them live in good rooms; 3. Patiently teach them how to protect themselves and kill the enemy; 4. Do more public service and less work for them; 5. Carry out cultural and entertainment activities and pay attention to unity. Under such enthusiastic care, all the new soldiers are happy and at ease. Wang Jinxi from Nanhe County said: "Comrades are like brothers. They are so enthusiastic in helping me make progress. I must perform meritorious service in battle; only by eliminating Chiang Kai-shek can the people live a good life."
