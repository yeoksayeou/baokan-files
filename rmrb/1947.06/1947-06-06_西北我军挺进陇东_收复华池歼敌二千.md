Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared in the Longdong area occupied by the Jiang-Hu army on the 30th of last month, and simultaneously launched a counterattack against the three strongholds of the Jiang army, including Hua Chi County (formerly Yuele Town), Jiangtai Town 40 miles north of the city, and Heshui City to the south. According to preliminary battle results, nearly 2,000 Jiang-Hu troops have been annihilated. The defenders of Jiangtai were the 179th Regiment (missing the 1st Battalion) of the 61st Provisional Brigade of the 81st Division of Ma Hongbin's Jiang army. After five hours of fighting, they were completely wiped out. A total of more than 1,300 enemies were annihilated, including more than 800 captured alive below the regimental commander, and captured six mortars, twelve heavy machine guns, thirty-six light machine guns, six 60mm mortars, and more than 600 rifles. The defenders of Hua Chi were the 3rd Regiment (missing half a company) of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade of the Jiang army. The People's Liberation Army soldiers recovered the city in one charge, and none of the defenders escaped. The People's Liberation Army suffered only 20 casualties. In this battle, 550 Jiang troops were killed or captured, including more than 400 captured alive below Deputy Brigade Commander Chen Yingquan and Regiment Commander Wang Tao, and more than 400 war horses, two mortars, four heavy machine guns, more than 30 light machine guns, more than 300 rifles, and 60,000 rounds of ammunition were captured. The Jiang army stationed in Yuan Town, 80 li north of Hua Chi, fled in panic upon hearing the alarm, and the town was recovered. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army compressed the 24th Regiment of the New 8th Cavalry Brigade of the 82nd Division of Ma Bufang's Jiang army and the Jiang-controlled Gansu Security Brigade, which had invaded Heshui City, into the city on the 29th. More than 1,300 infantry and cavalry of the brigade stationed in Qingyang came out to reinforce from the east and were completely defeated by the People's Liberation Army in the Weijiagou area, seven miles southwest of Heshui City. In terms of war horses alone, more than 300 were killed or wounded and more than 200 were captured. The Jiang army in Qingyang and other places repeatedly reinforced for the second time, and the deployment became more and more chaotic. The People's Liberation Army, with its expected goals achieved, has withdrawn from the periphery of Heshui.
