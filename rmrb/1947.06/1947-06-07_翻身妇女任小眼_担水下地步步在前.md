　　Liberated Woman Ren Xiaoyan
    Carrying Water and Working the Fields, Always Taking the Lead
    [Our paper, Xiyang News] Ren Xiaoyan, a woman from Huihuang Village, has made contributions on the production front. She is forty-six years old this year. In the past, her family was poor. Twenty-nine years ago, the anti-Japanese government gave her six dou of black beans as relief, but the landlord Zhao Cheng demanded back rent. Her husband starved to death, and her two children had no food or clothing and could not go out. During the land reform, she spoke of her suffering and was liberated, receiving eight rooms, one cave dwelling, twelve mu of land, as well as farm tools and livestock. She happily said, "In the past, it was Chiang Kai-shek's world, and we had nothing to produce with. Now it's the world of us poor people. Chairman Mao leads us, and we have everything we need, so we must produce well." After the war participants left, she consciously organized eleven women to participate in production, and everyone elected her as the group leader. Later, she led all ninety-eight women and eighty-four children in the village into the production movement. The women's group led by Zhai Rutang wanted to compete with Ren Xiaoyan's group, and the children also wanted to challenge her group. Everyone worked hard from dawn till dusk, completing the delivery of more than 5,000 loads of manure in the village within ten days. Ren Xiaoyan also took the lead in all kinds of work, serving as a model in everything she did, moving the masses of the whole village to unanimously award Ren Xiaoyan a meritorious service.

　　翻身妇女任小眼
    担水下地步步在前
    【本报昔阳讯】回黄村妇女任小眼在生产战线上立了功。她今年四十六岁，过去家穷，二十九年抗日政府救济了她六斗黑豆，还被地主赵成要了欠租，男人饿死，两个孩子没吃没穿，不能出门。在土地改革中诉了苦翻了身，分到了房八间，窑一眼，地十二亩，还有农具和牲口。她高兴的说：“过去是蒋介石的天下，想生产什么都没有。现在是咱穷人的天下，毛主席领导咱，要啥有啥，可得好好生产哩。”参战人员走后，她即自觉的组织了妇女十一人参加生产，大家选她为小组长。以后又带领了全村九十八个妇女、八十四个儿童，卷入了生产运动。妇女翟如堂组要和任小眼组竞赛，儿童也要和她组挑战。大家这样起早搭黑，在十天内将全村五千多担粪扫数送完。任小眼各种活上也步步在前，样样模范，感动的全村群众异口同声的给任小眼立一功。
