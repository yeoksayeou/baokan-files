　　Militia Work Teams Deploy to Protect
    Bo'ai Border Area Harvests Day and Night
    [Report from this newspaper in Bo'ai] Currently, most of the wheat is ripening, and some areas have already begun harvesting. In order to protect the fruits of the masses' liberation and to combat the Kuomintang and puppet regime's plans to seize grain, the county command issued a special order to all districts and local armed forces a few days ago, urging them to take immediate action and use armed force to protect the wheat harvest, focusing on and systematically striking at the Kuomintang and puppet regime's grain-grabbing activities. It also called for "Quick harvest, quick strike, quick hide, don't let the enemy grab a single grain!" Under the slogans "Men and women work together, harvesting wheat day and night, wheat is life, traitorous landlords are the root of disaster, protect life, eradicate the root of disaster," the entire county has been widely mobilized. With the government's support and the approaching presence of militia work teams near the suburbs, the border area masses have taken up their sickles, organized mutual aid teams, and begun harvesting day and night. In addition, mountain militias are automatically attacking, supporting the masses in the plains to harvest wheat. The government has organized "Wheat Harvest Work Teams" (i.e., Liberation Teams) to go to various places to supervise and inspect. (Li Ping, Yu Wen, Shun Li)
    [Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 30th] The Southern Hebei District Party Committee is mobilizing the entire district to harvest wheat, demanding that local county Party committees seize the opportunity and mobilize all their strength to launch a wheat harvest blitz. 1. Local county Party committees should conduct in-depth mobilization based on the local cadres' and masses' thinking and work situation, and mobilize all labor and semi-labor in each village, with the branch as the core, to organize temporary mutual aid for emergency harvesting. 2. Party, government, military, and civilian organs and troops stationed above the county level should mobilize all cadres and miscellaneous personnel and soldiers to assist in the harvest, and give priority to helping poor military and martyrs' families, and the elderly, young, orphans, and widows who lack labor. 3. In individual counties and districts where the wheat is too damaged and the harvest is hopeless, a group of laborers can be organized as much as possible to work temporarily in counties and districts where the wheat is good, in order to increase the income of the masses and adjust labor. 4. When organizing the masses to harvest wheat in border and war zones, it should be coordinated with armed struggle to combat the enemy's grain grabbing and prevent sabotage by special agents.

    【本报冀南三十日电】冀南区党委动员全区力量进行麦收，要求各地县委抓紧时机，动员全力掀起麦收突击热潮。一、各地县委应根据本地干群思想及工作情况，进行深入动员，要把各村所有的劳动力、半劳动力以支部为核心组织动员起来，组织临时互助进行抢收。二、县以上党政军民驻地机关和部队，要动员机关全体干杂人员、部队战士助收，并尽先做到帮助无劳力的贫苦军、烈属及老幼孤寡等的麦收。三、在麦子太坏收成无望的个别县区，可尽量组织一批劳动力到麦子好的县区打短工，以增加群众收入、调剂劳力。四、边沿区、战区在组织群众麦收时应与打击敌人抢麦和制止特务捣乱的武装斗争配合起来。
