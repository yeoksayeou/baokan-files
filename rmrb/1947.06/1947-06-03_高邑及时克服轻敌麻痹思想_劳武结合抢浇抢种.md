　　Gaoyi Timely Overcomes Complacency and Apathy
    Labor and Military Combine to Rush Irrigation and Planting

    [This newspaper Gaoyi News] Gaoyi local armed militia are active day and night to cover the masses in a concentrated planting effort. At the beginning of the spring ploughing, due to the victory on the periphery of Shijiazhuang, complacency and apathy grew in the minds of the masses and cadres. The call to combine labor and military to intensify spring ploughing was not implemented. In some villages, even fortifications were demolished, and night sentry duty became lax, causing joint defense to lose its effectiveness. As a result, the masses suffered some unnecessary losses (six head of livestock were stolen by the enemy). After the timely pointing out by the county headquarters and extensive discussions among the masses, the complacency and apathy of the cadres and masses were broken, and the joint defense was rectified. The county-wide concentrated planting campaign quickly entered a climax. Under the cover of the militia, the masses pushed waterwheels day and night to irrigate the land. Every night, each village tightly sealed the street entrances with stone mines and landmines, leaving only one entrance and exit, so that most of the militia could be drawn out to cover the masses in irrigating the land. Therefore, the masses of Gusi Village formed several shifts of pushing waterwheels every night, with each shift very close to each other, surrounded by militia for cover. On the evening of the 7th, seven special agents came to the village to steal livestock. After being discovered by the militia, they were repelled with grenades. In the villages of the North Base Point in the Fourth District, in addition to the militia of each village providing cover, small armed units were organized by drawing militia from each village to patrol around the villages of the base point. Under the cover of the militia, the four villages of the North Base Point have concentrated on planting 8,500 mu and irrigating 3,200 mu (wheat has been irrigated twice) in half a month. In the past half month, the Yingbing [Camp Soldiers] and Wu Gong Dui [Armed Work Teams] have gone deeper into the border areas and Chiang-occupied areas, killing three enemies, capturing four, and wounding and blasting twelve. Flying explosions were carried out, making the enemy sit and lie uneasily. On the evening of the 6th, four strings of mines were buried under the sleepers of the Yuanshi Tietun Railway Station. The next day, when the enemy went to the station to pull sleepers, there were four loud bangs, injuring two enemies and killing one. Once, the enemy attempted to go out of the city to grab grain, but as soon as they went one or two li out of the city, they stepped on the landmines buried by the Armed Work Team, injuring two enemies. On the evening of the 18th, seven members of the Home Return Corps [還鄉團, a reactionary militia group] were active in Guxingzhuang, Fourth District, stealing one head of livestock. When they returned to Dachenzhuang Guocun, they ran into our Yingbing [Camp Soldiers]. A volley of gunfire dispersed the enemy, killing one and wounding five, and recovering the stolen livestock. On the evening of the 22nd, a unit of the enemy went to Xizhang Village to rob things. As soon as they entered the village, they stepped on seven stone mines. The enemy had no choice but to flee in a hurry. When they fled between Yuanshi Dongzheng, they entered the ambush circle of our Independent Battalion. A burst of gunfire from our Yingbing [Camp Soldiers] dazed the enemy, and four members of the Home Return Corps were captured alive. At present, this labor-military combined production movement is still continuing. (Qiao Lin, Wen Yan)

　　高邑及时克服轻敌麻痹思想
    劳武结合抢浇抢种
    【本报高邑讯】高邑地方武装民兵日夜活动掩护群众突击下种。春耕开始时，因有石门外围的胜利，群众和干部思想上，滋长了轻敌与麻痹思想。劳武结合加紧春耕的号召未能实行，有个别村庄甚至将工事拆毁，晚上岗哨形成自流，联防无形失掉作用。因而群众曾遭受了一些不应有的损失（曾被敌人抢走牲口六头）。经过县指挥部的及时指出与群众的广泛讨论，打破了干部与群众的轻敌麻痹思想，整顿了联防，全县的突击下种运动很快进入高潮，在民兵的掩护下群众日夜不息的推水车浇地，一到晚上，各村便把街口用石雷地雷严密封锁，只留一个口出入，这样即可将大部民兵抽出来掩护群众浇地。故寺村群众每晚组成数班推水车，各班相离都很近，周围有民兵掩护。七日晚有七名特务到该村抢牲口被民兵发现后，用手榴弹将敌击退。在四区北基点各村，除了各村的民兵掩护外，又在各村抽出民兵组织小型武装、在基点周围各村游动。在民兵的掩护下，北基点四个村在半月内已突击下种八千五百亩、浇地三千二百亩，（麦子都曾浇过二遍。）营兵和武工队半月来更深入边沿区和蒋占区活动，前后打死敌人三名，俘四名、打伤及炸伤十二名。开展飞行爆炸，炸的敌人坐卧不宁。六日晚将四个连珠雷埋到元氏铁屯车站道木底下，第二天敌人到车站上拉道木，轰、轰、轰、轰四声巨响，炸伤敌人二个，死一个。有一次敌人企图出城抢粮，刚出城一、二里地，即踏响了武工队埋的地雷，炸伤敌人二个。十八日晚还乡团七名到四区谷兴庄活动，抢走牲口一头，返回时到大陈庄郭村与我营兵碰上，一排子枪将敌打散，打死敌一名、伤五名，夺回被抢去牲口。二十二日晚敌人一部到西张村抢东西，进村即踏响石雷七个，敌人只好急忙逃回，逃到元氏东正之间，进了我独立营伏击圈内，我营兵一阵枪响将敌打的昏头昏脑，活捉敌还乡团四名。目前这一劳武结合的生产运动，仍在继续开展中。（乔林、文彦）
