　　Jiang Jun's Treacherous Acts
    Destroying the Anti-Japanese Martyrs' Cemetery in Huaiyin

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th. The Liu Laozhuang New Fourth Army Eighty-Two Martyrs' Cemetery in Huaiyin, revered by all the people of Northern Jiangsu, was destroyed by Jiang's troops. On May 16th and 17th, a company of the 187th Brigade of the 65th Division of Jiang's army, entrenched in Wulizhuang on the Huai (yin)-Shu (yang) road, along with hundreds of local Jiang's puppets, sneaked into Liu Laozhuang and dismantled the martyrs' cemetery day and night, transporting the wood and bricks to various strongholds along the Huai-Shu road to build bunkers. Currently, the steps of the memorial碑, the martyrs' tower, and the six large memorial halls inside the mausoleum have been leveled. This was because in the spring of 1943, during the Japanese invaders' large-scale "mopping-up" operation in Northern Jiangsu, on March 18th, over three thousand enemy soldiers from the 65th Division's infantry and cavalry regiments, in a "iron wall encirclement," attempted to bloodbath Huaiyin. Eighty-two brave soldiers of the Fourth Company of the 19th Regiment of the 7th Brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army, defended Liu Laozhuang north of the county, fighting heroically, fighting fiercely for a day and night, killing and wounding over three hundred enemies. After destroying their weapons, they sacrificed heroically, intimidating the enemy and saving the people of the county from much suffering. After the battle, the local elders built a martyrs' tower more than ten feet high with tears in their eyes. In the spring of 1945, the people of the county raised funds and contributed their efforts to build a martyrs' cemetery of sixty-four acres. During every spring and autumn festival, people gather to offer flowers and sweep the tombs. This time, it was destroyed by the traitor Jiang's puppets, causing immense anger among the 400,000 people of the county, who sent telegrams to the whole country demanding that the traitorous actions of Jiang's puppets, who insulted national heroes, be sanctioned. They also sent a sorrowful telegram to Commander Huang Kecheng of the former New Fourth Army 3rd Division, who is fighting in the Northeast, hoping to annihilate even more of Jiang's troops, avenge the eighty-two martyrs, and uphold justice for the nation. They called on the people of the entire Huaihai region to actively defend their country and homes, defeat the bandit Jiang as soon as possible, and rebuild the martyrs' cemetery.
