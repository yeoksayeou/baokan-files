　　The Experiment of Military Exercises (Continued)
    Li Yun
    Soldiers are soldiers whether on or off stage

    In the past, military exercises always involved ordinary people, even some women, seemingly to avoid monotony. Now, it has been proven that military exercise plays do not necessarily need ordinary people or women. In fact, without women or the participation of ordinary people, the play can still be lively and exciting, without any sense of monotony.

    Through exploration, it has also been proven that whatever soldiers wear off stage, they can wear on stage without appearing monotonous or vulgar. Initially, some comrades thought that while soldiers could perform on stage, they should be different from their off-stage appearance to resemble actors; otherwise, the distinction between on and off stage would be blurred.

    The same goes for makeup. Exaggerated makeup is not necessarily well-received. Transforming a hot-tempered comrade into someone with a crooked mouth, slanted eyes, and raised eyebrows, or turning a mischievous comrade into a clown, is not something everyone agrees with. This is because such characters do not exist in the actual life of our revolutionary ranks. On the contrary, simple makeup that resembles real-life figures is more likely to spark interest. The content of the play and the characters' personalities are primarily expressed through language and actions, not through makeup.

    Initially, everyone going on stage, regardless of their role, would be made up to show distinction. Later, as more soldiers went on stage, they stopped using any makeup and just went on stage to perform.

    Do it the convenient way

    As mentioned earlier, performances can be held on stage or in the square without being restricted. Here, I would like to discuss some issues related to stage movements and scenes.

    The scenery does not necessarily have to follow the conventions of spoken drama. Except for necessary props, everything else can be omitted, adopting some scene techniques from traditional Chinese opera.

    Scenes do not need to be strictly divided. Just perform one scene after another, explaining the changes in time and location to the audience.

    In addition to boldly bringing soldiers' actions onto the stage, symbolic techniques from traditional opera can also be used (such as opening and closing doors, riding horses, flying airplanes, etc.). We have also adopted quite a few back-to-the-audience speaking techniques in our military exercises. This is a familiar performance method, and its use has not been seen to harm the plot.

    The pace should also be casual, not as strict as in spoken drama. Here, energetic steps that follow the plot's development and are combined with music should be promoted. The steps of the rural Yangko dance are not suitable for performing soldiers and should not be used.

    Collective movements and collective singing scenes, sometimes with even twenty or thirty people on stage, moving and singing simultaneously, are scenes that are not easily found in plays about peasants. Soldiers are a highly centralized, ideologically unified, action-unified, and armed organization. The entire lifestyle of soldiers cannot be portrayed without such scenes.

    In short, when soldiers are on stage, you don't need to be overly demanding about their movements and expressions. As long as it doesn't harm the plot, let them find the movements they feel comfortable with or are familiar with, gradually refining them from rough to fine.

    Soldiers like to sing about themselves

    In the past three months of military exercises at the Military University, we have discovered the following phenomenon: out of the approximately two hundred programs performed by the major teams, none did not use songs, with at least quick clapper talk. This is not the result of leadership promotion but rather a trend created by the masses themselves. Whenever something is created, they find an old tune to fill in with lyrics or simply find a good tune and then write a play. A large portion of the songs usually learned are moved into the plays by everyone, but we no longer have the form of spoken drama plus songs but have become a singing drama with intertwined singing and dialogue.

    Why do the masses like to sing so much? Is it to be fashionable? This cannot be said. Is it easy? Not really. So, what is the reason? The popularity of singing dramas and the joy of listening are the general responses, but from a fundamental perspective, I think it is the result of its combination with the thoughts and emotions of soldiers. A revolutionary fighter (and revolutionary masses as well) lives in a revolutionary family, so comfortable and free, so bright and promising, so capable of unleashing the talents of every comrade, so loving, united, sincere, pure, joyful, happy, and youthful. Then, is it strange that they need to use singing to sing out everything about themselves? Moreover, soldiers' lives are often filled with singing, so it is naturally indispensable in plays. Due to the reasons mentioned in the previous section, collective singing is also indispensable.

    Therefore, the widespread development of singing dramas is essential in military exercises.

    Old opera tunes can be used (such as Yangko, Luozhi, Bangzi, @ @, Drums, Zhuizi, etc.), but ultimately, they cannot properly express the lives of soldiers. Initially, to open up the path of military exercises, there can be no restrictions. Later, we must gradually find magnificent and powerful tunes to perform soldiers. In recent months, the most used and widespread have been parts or individual pieces from "The Army and the People are One Family," "Two Kinds of Work Styles," "Zhou Zishan," and "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland." Strangely enough, after these plays have been performed once or twice, some of the tunes inside are quickly learned by everyone and are naturally used in their own plays, many of them used very appropriately. Why are there so many tunes, but everyone only loves to sing and quickly learns these few, and use them to express their own life and feelings? The reason for this is that these tunes have the characteristics of being concise, magnificent, and lively.

    Another feature of the songs welcomed by soldiers is that the music is simple and short, and lyrics can be filled in and sung repeatedly. Such tunes are easy to sing, easy to remember, and easy to fill in with new lyrics. If the music is very long, even if it has magnificent characteristics, everyone does not like to use it in plays because it is difficult to fill in lyrics, and repeated singing and expression are not easy to handle.

    Do not use too many songs in military exercise plays. Dramas like "The Army and the People are One Family," "Two Kinds of Work Styles," and some that use different songs from beginning to end, as higher-level works, are very good and are also needed by the troops. However, because there are many songs and they are difficult to learn, it is not easy for soldiers to perform, so they cannot be popularized in the troops at present. I suggest that comrades who do literary and artistic work in the troops should compile more troop plays with fewer tunes in the future for use by various troops.

    Some soft tunes popular in the countryside, such as "Ya Yao Ya Yao Yi Ya Yao," although beautiful, cannot express the emotions of soldiers and are best not used or used less.

    In terms of instruments, percussion instruments should be used boldly. In the Second Detachment's performance of "Graduation to the Front Line," large gongs and drums were used during construction, tactics, bayonet fighting, and grenade throwing actions and expressions, like the playing methods in old operas, which was also very lively and intense, enhancing the atmosphere of the drama.

　　演兵的试验（续完）
    立云
    上台下台都是兵
    过去演兵时候，总是有老百姓，甚至还必须有些女的，似乎那样子才不单调，现在证明演兵的戏不一定非老百姓非女的不行，甚至不要女的，没有老百姓参加，也一样是热热闹闹的好戏，并无单调之感。
    穿什么衣服，化什么装，经过摸索也证明了：在台下穿什么，上了台还可以穿什么，如此并不单调，也不俗气。开始有的同志是有这种想法的：他们认为兵上台是可以，但是和台下要有些区别才像演戏，不然就会台上台下不分。
    化装也是这样，很夸大的化法不一定受欢迎，把一个脾气暴燥的同志化成嘴歪眼斜双眉倒竖，把挑皮的同志化成为小丑那样，大家并不赞成。因为在我们革命队伍的实际生活里并不存在那样的人物。相反化素装上台，跟现实人物相同，倒很能引起兴趣，剧的内容，人物的性格，主要是靠语言，动作等来表现的，不是靠化装来表现的。
    开始演时，凡属上台的同志，不管担任什么角色，总要描画一番以示区别，后来，兵上台的多了，就连什么也不抹，走上台去就演了。
    怎么方便怎么来
    在舞台在广场都可以出演不必拘泥，前面已经说过了，这里再说说有关舞台动作与场面一些问题。
    布景不必一定采取话剧那一套，除必要的导具外，一切可以省略，采取中国唱旧剧的一些场面办法。
    场次不必严格分，一场一场演下去，时间和地点的差异向观众说明一下就好了。
    舞台动作除前述可把兵的动作大胆搬上舞台外，旧戏里象征的手法也可以采用（如开关门、骑马、坐飞机等）。背台说话的动作我们演兵中也采用了不少，这是大家都熟悉的表演法，用起来也未见损害什么剧情。
    步伐也求其随便，不必像话剧那样严格，这里有的跟着剧情发展，结合着音乐，踏起的健壮的步子是应该提倡的，农村里扭秧歌的步子不适合表演兵，还是不用为好。
    集体的动作和集体的歌唱的场面，有时甚至二三十人上台，同时动作同时唱，这样的场面在演农民的戏里是不容易找到的。兵是高度集中性的思想统一行动统一武装组织，不用这种场面就不能表演兵的生活样式的全部。
    总之：兵上了台，你不必在动作上表情上过于苛求，只要不损伤剧情，就让他自己找自己感到方便或一同熟悉的动作法，由粗而细，逐渐美化。
    兵喜欢歌唱自己
    军大三月来演兵中，发现了这样一种现象：一大队出演的大大小小的节目约有二百个，没有一个不用歌曲的，至少的是快板。这并不是领导上提倡的结果，而是群众自己造成的风气，凡编成一个东西，都要找个旧调填些词加在里面，或干脆找好调子再编剧，平常所学的歌很大一部分被大家搬到戏里面去了，但是，我们已没有话剧加歌曲那样的形式，而是成了唱白血肉交织的歌唱剧。
    群众为什么这样喜欢歌唱？比时髦吗？不能这样讲，容易搞吗？也不是。那么，道理在那里呢？歌唱的剧红火，听了愉快乃是一般的反映，而从基本上来考虑，我想由于是它和兵的思想情感相结合的结果。一个革命战士（革命群众也是如此）他生活在革命大家庭里，是如此舒适和自由，如此光明和有前途，如此能发挥每个同志的天才，如此的热爱，团结，诚挚，纯洁，欢快，幸福与年青。那么，他们须要用歌唱来唱出自己的一切，还有什么奇怪呢？何况，兵的生活中就是常常充满歌唱的，反映到剧上自然也不可缺少了。由于上节提到的原因，集体的歌唱亦不可缺少。
    因之，在演兵中广泛发展歌唱剧是必须的。
    旧戏的调子可以用（如秧歌、落子、梆子、＠＠、大鼓、坠子等）然它究竟不能妥善表现士兵生活，开始，为了打开演兵之路，可以不加限制，到了后来，就必须逐渐寻找雄壮铿锵的调子来演兵。几个月来，我们用得最多最广泛的是“军民一家”，“两种作风”，“周子山”，“兄妹开荒”等剧团一部分或个别的曲子。很奇怪：这些戏演过一两次之后，里面一部分曲子很快被大家唱熟了，也很自然的被用在自己所编的剧里了，许多用的很恰当。为什么曲子那么多，而大家却只爱唱且很快唱熟了这几个，并把它用来表现自己的生活感情，推究其原因，就是因为这些曲子具有简截，雄壮，明快的特点。
    兵所欢迎的歌曲还有另外一个特点，就是乐曲简单短小的，能填上词反复唱的，这样的曲子容易唱，容易记，容易填新词。如果是很长的乐曲，即使具有雄壮的特点，大家也不爱往剧里面用，因为填词困难，反复唱和表情都不大好办。
    演兵的戏里，用的歌曲也不要太多，像“军民一家”，“两种作风”，和一些用不同的歌曲从头唱到尾的戏剧，作为较高级的作品，是很好的，对部队也是需要的，然而由于歌曲多，不好学，如果叫士兵演也不大容易，因之目前也是不能在部队流行的。我建议做部队文艺工作的同志，今后多编些用曲子较少的部队剧，供各部队采用。
    乡村里流行的一些软性小调，如“呀哟呀哟伊呀哟”之类，虽然优美，但不能表演兵的情绪，顶好不用或少用。
    乐器方面，打击乐器要大胆使用。二大队演的“毕业上前线”，筑城、战术、刺杀、投弹等动作表情时都配以大锣、大鼓，像旧剧那样的打法，也很热烈紧张，增进戏剧气氛。
