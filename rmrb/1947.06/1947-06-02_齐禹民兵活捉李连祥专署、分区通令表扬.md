　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 31st] The Qi-Yu militia captured the traitor Li Lianxiang and were commended by the Special Commissioner's Office and Military Commission of the Sixth Sub-district with a meritorious service award. On May 14th, the militia from more than ten villages, including Jiangzhuang, Youfang, Songzhuang in the Fourth District of Qi-Yu, and Longzhuang in the First District, participated in the Yancheng Campaign, seizing 34 rifles, 3 pistols, and capturing over 40 enemy soldiers, and also capturing the Qi-Yu criminal and traitor Li Lianxiang alive. The achievements in this campaign were remarkable and can be called a model battle. Jiang Muzhi, the militia squad leader of Jiangzhuang in the Fourth District, bravely pursued the enemy, capturing over 10 enemy soldiers and seizing 10 rifles. He gloriously sacrificed his life due to severe injuries. The Military Commission of the Sixth Sub-district has decided to posthumously recognize him as a militia combat hero, and has issued a commendation order, calling on the militia of the entire district to learn from him. Comrade Jiang Muzhi was a Communist Party member and had consistently worked actively in the militia, enjoying the support of the masses.
