Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: An authoritative figure of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) made comments to a Xinhua News Agency reporter regarding the current situation. The CCP authoritative figure said: The Chiang Kai-shek government, which is at odds with the entire people, has now found itself surrounded by the entire people. Whether on the military front or the political front, the Chiang Kai-shek government has suffered defeats; it has been surrounded by the forces it has declared as enemies and cannot think of a way to escape. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and its master, American imperialists, have misjudged the situation. They overestimated their own strength and underestimated the strength of the people. They regarded China and the world after World War II as the same as in the past, not allowing any change in the way things were, and not allowing anyone to violate their will. Since the surrender of Japan, they decided to restore China to its old order. After using deceptive methods such as political consultation and military mediation to buy time, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government mobilized two million troops and launched a full-scale offensive. The CCP authoritative figure said: The war between Chiang Kai-shek's invading army and the People's Liberation Army is the first front, and now a second front has emerged. This is the sharp struggle between the great and just student movement and the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government. The slogans of the student movement are to have food, to have peace, and to have freedom, that is, to oppose hunger, oppose civil war, and oppose oppression. Chiang Kai-shek promulgated temporary measures to maintain social order. Conflicts occurred everywhere between Chiang Kai-shek's military, police, secret agents, and the student masses. Chiang Kai-shek used violent acts such as arrest, imprisonment, beatings, and massacres to deal with unarmed students; the student movement, on the contrary, expanded day by day. All social sympathy is on the side of the students, and Chiang Kai-shek and his running dogs are completely isolated. Chiang Kai-shek's hideous face is completely exposed. The student movement is part of the entire people's movement, and it is also the organizer of the entire people's movement. The historical experience of the past May Fourth Movement and the December 9th Movement has already pointed this out. Because American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek replaced the position of Japanese imperialism and its running dog Wang Jingwei, and adopted the policy of turning China into an American colony, the policy of launching a civil war, and the policy of strengthening fascist dictatorial rule, they declared themselves enemies of the entire people, and they placed all strata of the people on the line between hunger and death; therefore, they forced all strata of the people to unite and fight a life-and-death struggle with the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government, and made this struggle develop rapidly. There is no other way out. The various strata of the Chinese people, including workers, peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, other patriotic elements, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese, who are oppressed by the various reactionary policies of the Chiang Kai-shek government and are in a position of unity and self-salvation, constitute an extremely broad united front of the entire nation. The CCP authoritative figure said: The extremely reactionary financial and economic policy that the Chiang Kai-shek government has implemented for a long time is now strengthened by the unprecedented traitorous treaty, namely the Sino-American Commercial Treaty. On the basis of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty, American monopoly capital and Chiang Kai-shek's bureaucratic comprador capital are tightly combined, controlling the national economic life. As a result, it has caused extreme inflation, unprecedented price increases, the increasing bankruptcy of national industry and commerce, and the deteriorating lives of the working masses and public employees. This situation has forced all strata of the people to unite and fight to save themselves from death. The CCP authoritative figure pointed out: Military suppression and political deception are the two main tools for Chiang Kai-shek to maintain his reactionary rule. Now people have seen the rapid bankruptcy of these tools. Chiang Kai-shek's army has suffered defeats in every battlefield. From July of last year to now, just in terms of its regular army, about ninety brigades have been annihilated. Not only is the kind of spirit when it occupied Changchun, Chengde, Zhangjiakou, Heze, Huaiyin, and Andong last year gone, but even the kind of spirit when it occupied Linyi and Yan'an this year is now gone. Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng once mistakenly estimated the strength of the People's Liberation Army and the fighting methods of the People's Liberation Army, thinking that retreat was cowardice and giving up some cities was a failure. They妄想 (vainly hoped) to solve the problem within the Guannei (inside the passes, i.e., North China) in three months or six months, and then solve the problem in the Northeast. But ten months later, Chiang Kai-shek's entire invading army has already been deeply trapped, heavily surrounded by the people of the liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army, and it is very difficult to escape. The news of the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's army on the front line is spreading more and more to the rear, and the broad masses of people who are oppressed by the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government and can't breathe are increasingly feeling that there is hope for their own liberation. Just at this time, all of Chiang Kai-shek's political deceptions were quickly bankrupted due to Chiang Kai-shek's rapid staging. Everything was beyond the expectations of the reactionaries: what convening of the National Assembly to formulate a constitution, what reorganization of the one-party government into a multi-party government, the purpose of which was originally to isolate the CCP and all democratic forces; the result was the opposite, it was not the CCP or any democratic force that was isolated, but the reactionaries themselves. From then on, the Chinese people knew from their own experience: what is Chiang Kai-shek's National Assembly, what is Chiang Kai-shek's constitution, what is Chiang Kai-shek's multi-party government. Before this, many people in the Chinese people, mainly the middle class, still had some illusions about Chiang Kai-shek's methods. The same is true for Chiang Kai-shek's so-called peace talks. After several solemn armistice agreements were torn to shreds by Chiang Kai-shek, after pointing bayonets at the students who wanted peace and opposed civil war, no one, except for those who deliberately deceive people or those who are politically inexperienced, would believe Chiang Kai-shek's peace talk deception. The CCP authoritative figure said: All events prove that our estimation is correct. We have constantly pointed out to the people that the Chiang Kai-shek government is nothing but a government of treason, civil war, and dictatorship. This government wants to use the means of civil war to wipe out the CCP and all democratic forces, in order to achieve the goal of turning China into an American colony and maintaining its own dictatorial rule. But because this government adopted these reactionary policies, it became politically devoid of prestige and power. The strength of the Chiang Kai-shek government is only temporary and superficial, and in fact it is a government that looks strong but is weak inside. Its offensive can be defeated, no matter where or on what front. Its future is bound to be one of universal betrayal and complete annihilation. All events have proven and will continue to prove the correctness of these estimates. The CCP authoritative figure said: The development of events in China is faster than people expected. On the one hand, the victory of the People's Liberation Army, and on the other hand, the future of the people's struggle in the Chiang-controlled areas, are both very fast. In order to realize a peaceful, democratic, and independent new China, the Chinese people should prepare all necessary conditions.

    评论目前时局
    【新华社陕北三十日电】中共权威人士向新华社记者发表关于目前时局的评论。中共权威人士说：与全民为敌的蒋介石政府，现在业已发现它自己处在全民的包围中。无论是在军事战线上，或者是在政治战线上，蒋介石政府都打了败仗；都已被它所宣布为敌人的力量所包围，并且想不出逃脱的方法。蒋介石卖国集团及其主人美国帝国主义者，错误的估计了形势。他们曾经过高地估计了自己的力量，过低地估计了人民的力量。他们把第二次世界大战以后的中国与世界，看成和过去一样，不许改变任何事物的样式，不许任何人违背他们的意志。自日本投降以后，他们决定要把中国恢复到过去的旧秩序。经过政治协商与军事调处等项欺骗办法，赢得时间之后，蒋介石卖国政府就调动了二百万军队，实行了全面的进攻。中共权威人士说：蒋介石进犯军和人民解放军的战争，这是第一条战线，现在又出现了第二条战线。这就是伟大的正义的学生运动与蒋介石反动政府之间的尖锐斗争。学生运动的口号是要饭吃、要和平、要自由，亦即反饥饿、反内战、反压迫。蒋介石颁布了维持社会秩序临时办法，蒋介石的军、警、宪、特与学生群众之间到处发生冲突，蒋介石用逮捕、监禁、殴打、屠杀等暴力行为对付赤手空拳的学生；学生运动反而日益扩大。一切社会同情都在学生方面，蒋介石及其走狗完全陷于孤立。蒋介石的狰狞面貌暴露无遗。学生运动是整个人民运动的一部分，又是整个人民运动的组织者。学生运动的高涨，不可避免地要引导到整个人民运动的高涨。过去五四运动时期与一二九运动时期的历史经验，业已指出了这一点。由于美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石，代替了日本帝国主义及其走狗汪精卫的地位，采取了变中国为美国殖民地的政策，发动内战的政策，及加强法西斯独裁统治的政策，他们就宣布他们与全国人民为敌，他们就将全国各阶层人民放在饥饿与死亡的界线上；因而就迫使全国各阶层人民团结起来，和蒋介石反动政府作你死我活的斗争，并使这个斗争迅速发展下去。除此以外再无出路。被蒋介石政府各项反动政策所压迫，处于团结自救地位的中国各阶层人民，包括了工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、开明绅士、其他爱国分子、少数民族及海外华侨在内，这是一个极其广泛的全民族的统一战线。中共权威人士说：蒋介石政府所长期施行的极端反动的财政经济政策，现在被空前的卖国条约即中美商约所加强。在中美商约的基础上，美国的独占资本与蒋介石的官僚买办资本紧紧地结合在一起，控制着全国的经济生活。其结果造成了极端的通货膨胀，空前的物价高涨，民族工商业日益破产，劳动群众及公教人员的生活日益恶化。这种情形，迫使各阶层人民不得不团结起来，为救死而斗争。中共权威人士指出：军事镇压与政治欺骗，是蒋介石维持自己反动统治的两个主要工具。现在人们业已看到这些工具的迅速破产。蒋介石的军队无论在那个战场都打了败仗。从去年七月到现在，仅就其正规军来说，即已被歼灭约九十个旅。不但去年占长春、占承德、占张家口、占菏泽、占淮阴、占安东时候的那种神气现在没有了，就是今年占临沂、占延安时候的那种神气现在也没有了。蒋介石、陈诚曾经错误地估计了人民解放军的力量与人民解放军的作战方法，以为退却是胆怯，放弃若干城市是失败。妄想在三个月或六个月内解决关内问题，然后再解决东北问题。但在十个月之后，蒋介石全部进犯军业已深入绝境，被解放区人民及人民解放军所重重包围，想要逃脱已很困难。蒋介石军队在前线打败仗的消息，传至后方的日益增多，被蒋介石反动政府压迫得喘不过气来的广大人民群众，就日益感觉自己的出头翻身有了希望。恰在这时，蒋介石的一切政治欺骗，由于蒋介石的迅速搬演而迅速破产。一切出于反动派意料之外：什么召开国民大会制定宪法呀，什么改组一党政府为多党政府呀，其目的原是为着孤立中共及一切民主力量；结果却是相反，被孤立的不是中共，也不是任何民主力量，而是反动派自己。从此以后，中国人民从自己的经验知道：什么是蒋介石的国民大会，什么是蒋介石的宪法，什么是蒋介石的多党政府。在这以前，中国人民中的许多人，主要的是中间阶层，对于蒋介石的这些手法是多少存了幻想的。对于蒋介石的所谓和谈，也是这样。在几次庄严的停战协定被蒋介石撕毁得干干净净之后，在用刺刀向着要和平反内战的学生群众之后，除了存心欺骗的人们、或者政治上毫无经验的人们之外，什么人也不会相信蒋介石的和谈欺骗了。中共权威人士说：一切事变都证明我们估计的正确。我们曾经不断地向人民指出，蒋介石政府不是别的，仅仅是一个卖国、内战、独裁的政府。这个政府欲以内战的手段，削平中共及一切民主力量，达到变中国为美国殖民地及维持自己独裁统治的目的。但是这个政府因为采取这些反动政策，它就在政治上变得毫无威信，毫无力量。蒋介石政府的强大只是暂时的、表面的，实际上是一个外强中干的政府。它的进攻是能够打败的，不论是在什么地方与在什么战线上。它的前途必然是众叛亲离，全军覆灭。一切事变都已经证明并将继续证明这些估计的正确性。中共权威人士说：中国事变的发展，比人们预料的要快些。一方面是人民解放军的胜利，一方面是蒋管区人民斗争的前途，其速度都是很快的。为了实现一个和平的、民主的、独立的新中国，中国人民应当准备一切必要条件。
