　　The wheat along the Tongpu Railway line is gradually ripening. Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, Hongtong, Linfen, and other counties have successively mobilized and organized all forces to launch a wheat harvest defense war. Twenty thousand stone mines will explode in the enemy's heart. In the first district of Lingshi, thirty-two young people have joined the guerrilla brigade. Universal joint defense is being implemented in all villages, covenants are being made, and two hundred blasting experts are being trained to prepare two thousand stone mines to be buried at key road intersections and near enemy strongholds. The Pingyao militia, in coordination with the 3rd company of the regular army, have formed a joint mine and rifle defense in various villages. If the enemy makes small-scale raids, we will concentrate our forces to wipe them out. If the enemy makes large-scale raids, we will use diversionary tactics to hold them back and strike them, making it difficult for them to move an inch. The Jiexiu Command calls on the militia to prepare 1,300 landmines and stone mines to strictly blockade the enemy and organize the masses in the mountains to come down to help with the wheat harvest. Huoxian held a hero meeting on May 21st to mobilize the wheat harvest. The heroes unanimously guaranteed to complete the plan of one stone mine per person and transferred the elite militia from the rear to the west bank of the Dazhang River in the front line to fully cover the wheat harvest, putting forward the slogan of "blasting and rushing to harvest." Linfen County also established a summer harvest protection command on May 21st. The county's militia cooperated with the Linfu Brigade to implement a combination of mines and rifles, implementing layer-by-layer blockades to cover the summer harvest. After the Hongtong County Command issued a call for village-to-village competition, everyone making contributions, village-to-village joint defense, and district-to-district mutual assistance, not allowing the enemy to seize a single grain of food, the guerrillas, work teams, militia, and public security teams have laid mines and set up defenses in the prepared areas.
