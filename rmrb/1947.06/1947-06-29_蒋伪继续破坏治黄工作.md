　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 27th – The Chiang Kai-shek's troops continue to sabotage the Yellow River management projects in the Liberated Areas. On the 16th, when civilian workers in Yanggu were engaged in emergency repairs at Liuqiao Village in Shou Zhang, they were subjected to intense shelling with mortars and machine-gun fire from Chiang's troops on the opposite bank, which continued throughout the day. The dyke works suffered significant damage. Later, the project was forced to be carried out at night, but Chiang's troops still fired frantically, and the emergency repair work was intermittent. On the 12th, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet security regiment under Gu Qilan, with 800 men, intruded into the Fangliji and Yujiaji areas along the river in Changyuan County, massacring over 70 civilian workers and looting a large amount of grain, clothing, and other items from the local villagers. The local people are extremely indignant and have spontaneously organized joint defense teams to protect the dyke restoration project. The Chiang bandits have also sent many special agents to infiltrate the construction areas to spread poison. According to two Chiang agents captured in Lvhuan Village, Fourth District of Guyang, they came in a group of more than 20 and have poisoned the villages west of the dam many times, mostly by putting poison into the wells.

　　蒋伪继续破坏治黄工作
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十七日电】蒋伪军继续破坏解放区治黄工程。十六日阳谷民工正在寿张刘桥村抢险，遭对岸蒋军以迫击炮及机枪猛烈射击，竟日未停。堤工遭受重大破坏。后工程被迫放在夜间进行，蒋军仍疯狂射击，抢险工程时断时续。十二日长垣蒋伪保安团谷其岚部八百余人进扰长垣属沿河方里集、余家集一带，惨杀民工七十余人，抢去乡民粮食衣物甚多。当地群情激愤，已自动组织起联防队，保卫复堤工程。蒋贼并派出许多特务，潜入施工地带放毒。据在谷阳四区律环村捕护的两名蒋特供称：他们这一次就来了二十多名，已在坝头以西各村放毒多次，大部投于水井中。
