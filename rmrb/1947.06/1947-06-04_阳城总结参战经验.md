　　(Our Taiyue Dispatch from the 1st) Zhang Tianyi, the county magistrate of Yangcheng, who personally led the masses to support the Jinan front, summarized the experience of leading the masses in the war this time. First, solve the ideological problems of the participating masses. In addition to the general ideological education of guaranteeing land, guaranteeing the family, and defending Chairman Mao, special attention must be paid to solving specific ideological problems. For example, the masses of Yangcheng had many ideological problems on the road, especially when entering the battle. At that time, these specific ideological problems were not solved, and only general appeals were used for education. As a result, the problems were not solved. Later, after in-depth investigation, it was found that they were afraid of airplanes, so they put forward methods of air defense, and the problem was solved immediately. Second, every participating mass is always afraid once, especially when injured, they are even more afraid. It is very important how to turn fear into fearlessness and turn fear into fearlessness. Although general political education and class education should be carried out, the main thing is to tell him how to be unafraid. For example, in the stretcher team of the Ninth Regiment, many people trembled when they heard the cannons at first. At this time, they should not be criticized for being timid, but should be told how to avoid the shells and how to run fast when crossing the blockade line. Later, everyone had a way, and they slowly became unafraid. Even if there are casualties, the causes of the casualties and the methods to avoid them should be reviewed. After discussion and research, fear can be eliminated. Third, the launch of the meritorious service campaign does not necessarily have to set the conditions for meritorious service first, it is best to enlighten the masses to raise it themselves. The evaluation of merit should be meticulous, graded, wide-ranging, and should adopt the method of public commendation. Fourth, regular political work: (1) Conduct education on caring for the wounded and summarizing experience. (2) Report the news of victory to encourage morale. (3) Fight against backward ideas, such as desertion. (4) Mass discipline. (5) Publicize to the new district the happy life after one's own liberation. (6) Emphasize the role of cadres, cadres should take the lead, cadres should serve everyone, and even put forward the slogan "Cadres suffer more, and the masses suffer less."

　　阳城总结参战经验
    【本报太岳一日电】亲自带领群众支援晋南前线的阳城张天乙县长，总结了此次带领群众参战经验，第一、解决参战群众思想问题。除一般的作保田，保家，保卫毛主席的思想教育外，尤须注意解决具体的思想问题。如阳城群众在路上，特别是进入战斗时思想上发生很多问题，当时没有根据这些具体思想问题去解决，只用一般号召去教育，结果没解决问题，后来深入调查，发现原来是怕飞机，就提出防空的方法，立刻把问题解决了。第二、每个参战群众总有一次怕，特别受到伤更怕，如何使怕变成不怕，把恐惧变成无畏是很要紧的。虽然一般应该进行政治教育，阶级教育，但主要的还是要告诉他不怕的办法。如在九团的担架队，起初很多人听见炮响就抖擞，这时不应批评他胆小，而是告诉他如何躲过炮弹的方法，过封锁线时又如何快跑。以后大家有了办法，就慢慢不怕了。即使受到伤亡，也应检讨伤亡原因，和避免的办法，经过讨论研究，便可把恐惧免去。第三、展开立功运动不一定要先定出立功的条件，最好启发群众觉悟自己提出来。评功的时候要细致、要分等级，面要宽，又应多采用当众表扬的办法。第四、经常的政治工作：（一）进行爱护伤员的教育，总结经验。（二）报告胜利消息，鼓励情绪。（三）与落后的思想斗争，如开小差等思想。（四）群众纪律。（五）向新区宣传自己翻身后的幸福生活。（六）强调干部作用，干部要带头，干部要为大家服务，更提出“干部多受苦，群众少受累”的口号。
