　　Guangzong Dynasty Pillar Mutual Aid Team
    Ordering Shares and Changing Labor to Cooperatively Harvest Wheat
    [Our newspaper's Hebei South, 1st dispatch] The Guangzong Qianjiudian labor hero Dynasty Pillar Mutual Aid Brigade is preparing to harvest wheat. Except for Wang Zhaoji's team, which is entirely changing labor, the remaining two teams have planted less wheat and are using mutual aid by groups. Dynasty Righteousness's entire group has planted one hundred mu of wheat, with twelve strong adults, nine old and young people, and five cows. Harvesting is expected to be completed in six days. The elderly do the cooking and deliver meals. Honorably discharged soldier Dynasty Han and Little Three (fifteen years old) are responsible for pulling the wheat, while the others harvest and thresh. Labor calculation and exchange methods: (1) Different shares of ten, nine, eight, and seven are determined according to the speed of wheat harvesting. Each person harvesting five mu per day is calculated as ten labor points (appropriately increased for damaged wheat). (2) One cow pulling six trips per day (combining near and far fields) is counted as one labor point. Threshing four hundred jin of wheat is counted as one labor point. A large cow is worth two human labor points, and a small cow is worth one and a half.
