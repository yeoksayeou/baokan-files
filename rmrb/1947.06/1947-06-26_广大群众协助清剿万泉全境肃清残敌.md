Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 24th -- Following the liberation of Wanquan in southwestern Shanxi, the broad masses of peasants actively assisted the democratic government in clearing and suppressing Chiang Kai-shek's and Yan Xishan's routed soldiers and armed secret agents. The entire territory has now been cleared. A total of over a hundred people, including Yan's special agent "Soldier-Farmer Commissioner" Yuan Yimao, were captured, and over a thousand people voluntarily requested to turn over a new leaf to the democratic government. They brought with them nine machine guns, four grenade launchers, over two thousand rounds of ammunition, two telephones, and one hundred and six rifles.
