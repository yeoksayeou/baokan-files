Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 8th: Lishui Ligezhuang recently launched a fierce re-examination and thorough movement, gaining the following main experiences: (1) Combining bottom-up mobilization with top-down education. At the beginning of the movement, on the one hand, educate the village cadres, review past shortcomings, and clearly propose to completely eliminate the landlord class, to the highest degree to meet the requirements of the peasants, especially to solve the land problem of landless and land-poor peasants, to achieve the goal of peasants being able to turn over completely both physically and mentally. It is also emphasized that the past method of substituting mass action with simple administration must be corrected, emphasizing that peasants must be mobilized to fight on their own, and truly promote democracy according to the opinions of more than 90% of the peasants. On the other hand, organize and mobilize activists among the poor peasants to raise their class consciousness, and then let them unite and organize the peasants of the whole village themselves. (2) Take the poor peasants as the backbone to unite all the peasants. The poor peasants are eager to fight and are also the most active. In practice, leaders of the poor peasants have emerged, forming an organized backbone force. After the poor peasants were mobilized, they themselves felt that it was necessary to unite the middle peasants. The poor peasants themselves came up with ways to unite the middle peasants. The most important point here is that the poor peasants clearly pointed out the targets of struggle to the middle peasants. In this way, the old middle peasants quickly joined in the development of the struggle, achieving the great unity of the peasants of the whole village. (3) Break through worries and turn over thoroughly. The first concern of the peasants was that they were afraid that the higher authorities would be soft-hearted, listen to the landlords' reflections and then correct the "deviations." This time, the leading cadres made self-criticism in front of the peasants, admitting past mistakes. They guaranteed that they would resolutely safeguard the interests of the peasants in the future and listen to the opinions of the majority, so that the peasants were relieved. The second concern was that they were afraid that the village cadres would distribute too much fruit, and they were dissatisfied with the past cadres' distribution of too much fruit. Therefore, the leadership immediately educated the cadres who had distributed too much fruit to admit their mistakes to the peasants and return the extra fruit, and immediately guided the peasants to pour out their grievances and dig out the roots of poverty, concentrating the firepower of the struggle against the landlords. (4) Let go of mobilizing the masses and leading the role. Due to the emphasis on self-criticism and correcting the past deviations of not following the mass line and not daring to let go boldly, it is generally said that the purpose of guiding the masses to act on their own has been achieved; however, new circles have been created in the minds of the cadres, so that some places have not made suggestions in time. For example, after the peasants in the main village united, they started to act without waiting for the peasants in the mountain village. At the beginning of the first congress of peasants in the whole village, some contradictions occurred between the main village and the mountain village. The main village said that the struggle in the mountain village was not active enough; later, a meeting of activists was convened to persuade them to actively unite the peasants in the mountain village, which quickly solved this deviation. This means that letting go of mobilizing the peasants and the leading role are not contradictory. Letting go became wrong regardless.

　　涞水李各庄
    复查经验
    【新华社晋察冀八日电】涞水李各庄最近掀起了猛烈的复查翻透身运动，获得以下几个主要经验：（一）自下而上的发动与自上而下的教育相结合。在运动开始发动时，一面对村干部进行教育，检讨过去的缺点，明确提出彻底消灭地主阶级，最高度的满足农民要求。特别是解决无地少地贫农的土地问题，达到农民都能翻透身翻透心的目的。并强调提出纠正过去不发动群众的包办代替办法，强调必须发动农民自己起来斗争，按照百分之九十以上农民的意见真正发扬民主。一面即组织发动贫农中的积极分子，提高其阶级觉悟，再由他们自己联合组织全村农民。（二）以贫农为骨干团结全体农民。贫农要求斗争迫切，也最积极。实际中涌现出了贫农的领袖，形成了有组织的骨干力量。在贫农发动起来以后，他们自己就感到非联合中农不可。贫农就自己想出了联合中农的方法。这里最主要的一点是贫农向中农明确指出斗争对象，这样，老中农随着斗争的发展很快就参加进来，达到全村农民大联合。（三）打破顾虑翻透心。农民的第一个顾虑是怕上级耳朵软，听了地主的反映又来纠正“偏向”。这次领导干部就在农民面前进行了检讨，承认过去的错误。保证以后坚决维护农民利益，听取大多数的意见，农民才放了心。第二个顾虑是怕村干部多分果实，且对过去干部多分果实不满。因此领导上即教育多分果实的干部向农民承认错误，退出多得果实，立即引导农民倒苦水，挖穷根，把斗争火力集中对付地主。（四）放手发动群众与领导作用。由于强调检讨与纠正了过去不走群众路线及不敢大胆放手的偏向，一般的说是达到了引导群众自己行动起来的目的；但是，干部思想上又产生了新的圈子，因而个别地方没有及时提出建议。比如主村的农民联合起来以后，没有等待山庄上的农民就开始行动了。第一次全村农民大会开始时，主村和山庄发生了一些矛盾，主村说山庄上斗争的不积极；后来就又召集了积极分子会议，说服他们主动的去联合山庄农民，才很快的解决这个偏向。这就是说放手发动农民和领导作用并没有矛盾。放手成了不管是错误的。
