　　Not Afraid of No Rain, Only Afraid of No Ideas
    Hao and Zhao Overcome the Mentality of Luck
    Labor Hero Zhao Fucheng Weighs Grain and Strictly Conserves
    [This newspaper, Shexian News] Haozhao Village, District Six, broke the mentality of luck and established the concept of long-term famine preparedness. Everyone in the village plans and every family conserves. After the village's six-day wheat harvest was completed, it was discovered that some people were reflecting: "We finally harvested some, we can eat a few meals!" "We just got through the famine, shouldn't have to go through it again, right?" and other ideas of luck. On the evening of June 10th, the labor cooperative held a meeting of the heads of various mutual aid teams to study and implement the idea of long-term famine preparedness. Labor hero Zhao Fucheng said, "To get through the famine, we have to calculate carefully! My family of six used to eat an average of two jin and ten liang of rice per day. These few days we have been saving twelve liang per day. In the past, what we ate in two days, now with more bran and vegetables, we eat for three days. I've already been weighing the food. I calculate that even with the wheat harvested in May of this year, after deducting public grain, there will be a surplus of one shi and five dou, which, when converted into rice, won't even last until May of next year. I still need to step up production." Liu Debing said, "The tree-top vegetables collected by our fifth group haven't been touched yet. Everyone is planning to collectively collect for two more days and save them up to get through the famine." Hao Baogui said, "Waiting for it to rain will only lead to losses. It's better to strike first. Last year, whoever planted first had good and early autumn crops. This year we must ensure that the whole group starts planting." Everyone proposed, "Our village has an old custom that after harvesting wheat in May, everyone must taste the new wheat. This is too wasteful. This year, we must focus on long-term famine preparedness. Each group must go back and abolish this old custom." Everyone was talking enthusiastically, and everyone realized: "Waiting and wondering until it rains is like waiting to die," "Not afraid of no rain, only afraid of no ideas," "It's not too late to start now."

　　不怕天不下只怕不想法
    郝赵克服侥幸思想
    劳英赵甫成吃粮过秤严格节约
    【本报涉县讯】六区郝赵村打破侥幸思想，树立长期备荒观念，全村人人打算家家节约。该村六天麦收完成后，发现有人反映：“总算收了些，还能不吃几顿哩！”“才过了荒年不该再过吧？”等侥幸思想，六月十号晚上，劳动合作社召开了各互助组长会议，研究贯彻长期备荒思想，劳动英雄赵甫成说：“过荒年可得合账哩，我家六口人以前每天平均吃二斤十两米，这几天每天省十二两，过去吃两天，现在多配些糠菜吃成三天了，我已经用秤秤着吃。我合算连今年五月收的麦子，除公粮外还余石五，换成米还吃不到明年五月，我还要加紧生产。”刘德兵说：“俺五组过去集的树头菜还没有动一点，大家又准备集体再采两天，积攒起来准备渡荒。”郝保贵说：“等天下雨只有吃亏，先下手为强，后下手遭殃，去年谁先种谁秋庄稼又好又熟的早，今年要保证全组都干下种。”大家提出：“咱村五月收了麦子有个旧规矩，都要尝尝新，这太浪费，今年要从长期备荒着眼，各组回去都得取消这老一套哩。”你一句他一句的扯得很有劲，大家认识了：“再疑惑等雨就是等死，”“不怕天不下只怕不想法”，“现在动手还不迟”。（长庆、泽民、志胜）
