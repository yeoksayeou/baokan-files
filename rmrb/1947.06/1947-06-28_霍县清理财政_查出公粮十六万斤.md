(From our Taiyue correspondent, 26th) In the financial rectification in the Yuebei region, Huo County has cleared out 160,000 jin of public grain. Lingshi County found that the finance and grain accountant had embezzled 12,981 jin of public grain and 14,167 yuan of public funds. In the past, Huo County was not strict in implementing the grain system, so various institutions and troops borrowed a large amount of grain, and the grain accounts of district and village governments often did not match. For example, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce borrowed 8,000 jin of grain in the past, but the account was forgotten due to personnel transfers. It was not until this cleanup that the finance and grain accountant, Cheng Shengwen, actively took responsibility and investigated the old accounts of previous years before discovering this account, and then demanded it from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. The Bureau of Industry and Commerce did not admit it, but Cheng Shengwen found many factual bases to clarify it. He also personally verified and settled the grain and money borrowed by the headquarters. Cheng Shengwen has been awarded a major merit for his work. After the embezzlement of public grain and public funds by Chen Ruyi, the finance and grain accountant of Lingshi, was discovered, the government confiscated all the grain and money he had privately stored in various places and continues to investigate.

　　霍县清理财政
    查出公粮十六万斤
    【本报太岳二十六日电】岳北在整顿财政中，霍县已清理出公粮十六万斤。灵石清理出财粮会计贪污公粮一万二千九百八十一斤，公款一万四千一百六十七元。按霍县过去在执行粮食制度上不严格，因此各机关部队借粮数字很大，区村政府粮账很多对不起头来，如过去工商局借粮八千斤，因人事调动就把这笔账忘了，直至此次清理，财粮会计成生文积极负责，清查历年陈账才发现这笔账，便向工商局要。工商局不承认，成生文找出许多事实根据才算搞清。司令部借的粮款他也亲自去核算结账。成生文因工作有功，已记大功一次。灵石财粮会计陈如意贪污公粮公款被查觉后，现政府将其私人在各地所存粮款全部没收，并继续追究。
