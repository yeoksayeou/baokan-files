Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 1st. – Personnel at military stations in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region are actively making contributions to the self-defense war. When the enemy attacked Dingbian, five people, including Cui Shaofu, a communicator from the Seventh Station, temporarily established a transit station at Qiaowaliang, three miles from the battlefield. After the troops moved, they were ordered to stay and transfer the wounded. They organized forty stretchers, ten donkeys, and more than twenty farmers, working tirelessly through the night. By the morning of the next day, they had finally carried away the last wounded soldier. The Sanbian Sub-district Office awarded them a fine horse. Luo Zongfa, a receptionist at the Fifteenth Outpost of the Longdong Military Station, provided attentive care to the wounded soldiers. He would immediately offer salted boiled water as soon as the wounded were taken off the stretchers, and he used water pipes made of artemisia stalks to feed them water, and he would use dug-out gourds to collect their excrement and urine. Xiong Guangji, who was in charge of food management at the outpost, tried his best to cook palatable dishes for the wounded, winning widespread praise from them. In the Panlong battle, eleven military station personnel were commended for their meritorious service. For a week, they worked day and night delivering messages and letters on the long transportation lines. For example, the communicator Li Jianzhang traveled more than 200 li in two nights, and 130 li in one day, resolutely completing his mission.

　　陕甘宁兵站人员
    照护伤员极周到
    【新华社西北一日电】陕甘宁边区各兵站人员，纷纷为自卫战争立功。敌人进攻定边时，七分站通讯员崔绍甫等五人，临时在离战场三里之乔瓦梁设立转运站，当部队转移后，受命留守该地转运伤员。他们组织四十付担架、十头毛驴、二十余名农民，星夜紧张赶运。至次日上午，终于抬走最后一个伤员。三边分区专署奖以骏马一匹。陇东兵站十五派出所的招待员罗宗发，对所住伤员招护周到，伤员刚下担架即递送盐开水，并以蒿麻杆自制的饮水管给伤员喂水，接屎接尿亦用挖好的葫芦。该所管理伙食的熊光稷，替伤员炒菜做饭尽力调得可口，博得伤员众口赞许。蟠龙战斗中，有十一个兵站人员上了功劳簿。他们在一周间，昼夜不停的奔忙在漫长的交通站上传送消息及信件。如通信员李建章，两夜走了二百多里，一天走了一百三十里，坚决完成任务。
