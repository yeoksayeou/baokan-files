Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 19th. After the Democratic Allied Forces entered the county seat of Xi'an, they discovered a shocking blood case of Chiang's troops massacring the people. In a vegetable garden more than a li away from the prison, seventeen corpses, victims of the brutal persecution by Chiang Kai-shek's and Du Yuming's troops, were lying there. Among them were three female corpses and fourteen male corpses. Except for one person wearing a padded military uniform, the rest were all dressed in ordinary people's clothing. The corpses were all stiff, with their hands tied with long ropes, their flesh and blood were blurred, their stomachs were broken, and their intestines were flowing out. The scene was too horrible to look at. According to Wu, an old woman who owns the vegetable garden and witnessed the tragedy, she saw several Chiang soldiers wearing copper helmets (steel helmets) escorting a group of people toward the flat house in front of the vegetable garden on the evening when the Democratic Allied Forces attacked Xi'an. The copper-helmeted soldiers shouted sternly, "Go inside, go inside, go inside!" Before they could enter the door, the Chiang soldiers behind them raised their submachine guns and started shooting. After the democratic government discovered the tragedy, it immediately prepared coffins for encoffining and stopped the coffins for three days, and issued a notice for the families of the deceased to come and claim them. Eleven corpses have now been taken back, including six coal miners from Li Si Ling and other places, a tailor named Zhang, and five students from the city, Gao Yanzheng and Gao Yuzheng sisters, and farmers from the suburbs. All of them were arrested by Chiang's police and intelligence personnel who considered them "suspected of being Eighth Route Army." The masses of the whole city and the bereaved families of the victims were all indignant at the cruel and brutal acts of Chiang's troops, and they all gritted their teeth and vowed to avenge the dead. In addition to allocating grain to comfort the families of the deceased, the democratic government has also issued an arrest warrant to arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.

　　西安蒋杜军败退前
    惨杀大批无辜民众
    民主政府通令缉捕凶犯
    【新华社辽东十九日电】民主联军进入西安县城后，发现一件惊人之蒋军屠杀人民的大血案。在离监狱一里多地的一家菜园子里，横陈着为蒋杜军惨害之尸体十七具，其中女尸三具，男尸十四具，除一人着夹军装外，其余均着老百姓服装。尸首均已僵硬，双手均为一根长绳捆绑，血肉模糊，肚破肠流，惨不忍睹。据目睹此惨案之菜园主人吴老太太称：当民主联军进攻西安之黄昏，见有几个戴铜帽子（钢盔）的蒋军，押着一群老百姓走向菜园平房门前，戴铜帽的厉声喊道：“往里去，进去、进去！”未等他们进门，后面那几个蒋军就端起冲锋枪扫射起来。民主政府发现此惨案后，当即备棺装殓，并停棺三日，布告死者家属前来认领。现已有十一具被领回，其中六个是李四岭等地煤矿工人，一个成衣工人张某，五个为本城学生高艳蒸、高玉蒸姊妹及城郊农民，均系蒋记警察及谍报人员认为是“八路嫌疑”而被捕。全城群众与蒙难家属，对蒋军残毒暴行，无不愤恨，均切齿发誓：要为死难者复仇。现民主政府除拨粮抚恤死者家属外，并发出通缉令，逮捕此案凶犯归案法办。
