　　Du Yunyue's Soldiers' Club (Conclusion)
  V. Uninterrupted Work During Marches and Battles
    The Fourth Company's club not only functioned during peacetime but also never ceased its activities during marches and battles, changing its methods of operation according to the situation.
    Before and after marches, the broadcasting committee would verbally broadcast the good deeds of comrades during the march, such as broadcasting that Squad Leader Xu Zhenqing carried five sacks of rice, two backpacks, and three rifles for others. Therefore, even during the most tiring moments of the march, the Fourth Company remained very active and served as the locomotive for the entire regiment's march.
    Last July, during the defense of Yongnian East Gate, located two hundred meters from the city wall in a small area with just over twenty households, surrounded by water, drinking sewage, and eating cold food, with daytime strafing and bombing by aircraft and nighttime mosquito harassment, the troops were very exhausted. The club borrowed gongs and drums for the soldiers to play, organized storytelling, and the broadcasting committee continued to broadcast about model soldiers during the defense, wrote articles, and read newspapers. Later, during the defense of the ice kiln north of the city, which was even smaller and closer to the enemy, the soldiers were confined to the caves and could not show their faces. The club created various chess games, Soviet cows, and other toys for everyone to play with.
    During the task of defending Daming, the broadcasted Q&A sessions served as combat mobilization and preparation work. It broadcast during the tight integration of work and rest, commending models in marching and digging fortifications, and comrades who performed heroically on the battlefield, boosting morale. During the siege of Chuwang in earthwork operations, in addition to general mobilization, preparation, and commendation, the club also proposed fulfilling promises, competing for merit, and summarizing the comrades who earned merit.
    In short, for every task from start to finish, the club's various organizations closely integrated with it, promoted the development, and completed various tasks, demonstrating its special achievements. This is an example for us in leading company work, utilizing club organizations, and uniting and mobilizing the masses of the entire company.

　　杜云月的军人俱乐部（续完）
  五、行军作战中不间断的工作
    四连俱乐部不仅在平时活动，在行军与作战中也从未间断过，随着情况的变化，改换活动方式。
    在行军前后，广播委员便将行军中的好同志进行口头广播，如广播三排长徐振清，给别人背了五个米袋子，两个背包，三条步枪。因此四连在行军中最疲劳的时候，亦很活跃，是全团行军的火车头。
    去年七月坚守永年东关，离城墙二百米远，二十多户人家的小地方，四周是水，喝污水，吃冷饭，白天飞机扫射轰炸，夜间蚊虫骚扰，部队很疲惫。俱乐部就借来锣鼓，让战士敲，组织说书讲故事，广播委员照常广播坚守中的模范、写稿、读报。后来又坚守城北冰淋窑，比东关的地方更小，离敌更近，战士们钻在窑洞里不能露头，俱乐部制造了各种棋类，苏联牛等玩具供大家玩。
    保卫大名任务中，广播问答作了战斗的动员与酝酿工作，抓紧结合与休息时间就广播，表扬行军挖工事中的模范，战场上表现英勇的同志，情绪越提越高。围困楚旺的土工作业中，俱乐部除一般的动员酝酿表扬外，又提出执行诺言，比赛立功，总结立功的同志。
    总之每件工作从始至终，俱乐部各种组织，都和他紧紧的集合起来，推动发展并完成各种工作，显示了其特殊的成绩，这是我们领导连队工作，运用俱乐部组织，团结发动全连群众的一个榜样。
