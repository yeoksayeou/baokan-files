　　Reporting the high political consciousness of liberated peasants. New soldiers are as brave and tenacious as veteran soldiers.

　　【This newspaper, Yu-Bei Front, 1st dispatch】Frontline reporter Wu Xiang reports: In a recent battle, Taihang new soldiers participated in combat for the first time, and their bravery and tenacity were no different from those of veteran soldiers. This demonstrates the high political consciousness and heroic spirit of the people in the liberated areas. In digging trenches under enemy fire, many new soldiers of the Bin character unit moved quickly and efficiently. Eight new soldiers, led by Deputy Platoon Leader Fu Laisan, were unanimously recommended for a commendation after discussion. During the assault, the commanders often ordered the new soldiers to stay behind, but they all resolutely demanded to go along. They said, "You'll only ever be a little colt if you never go out and fight. If we don't train this time, it'll still be the first time next time. We joined the army to fight Chiang Kai-shek!" During the assault by the Fourth Company of the Ming character unit, Xi Tangguo, a new soldier from Shahe, was hit in the face and body by fragments from an illuminating flare, but he ignored everything and ran forward, throwing four hand grenades. He climbed the ladder and threw two more, then charged into the wall of the stronghold alongside the veteran soldiers. When the Gong character unit was defending the Hou Xiaochang trench, they engaged in fierce fighting with Chiang's troops. Shen Dehu, a new soldier from Shahe, was monitoring the enemy through a gun hole, and three holes were shot through his hat. When someone asked him, "Do you still dare to observe?" he resolutely replied, "How can I not observe? What if the enemy comes up?" Later, as Chiang's troops approached, he threw more than ten hand grenades and, together with the veteran soldiers, bravely counterattacked, repelling Chiang's troops.
    【This newspaper, Yu-Bei Front, 1st dispatch】In a recent battle, more than twenty Taihang new soldiers, led by veteran soldiers, fought bravely and tenaciously. Yang Yongchang, a new soldier from Shahe in the Fifth Company, took a hand grenade and charged up with everyone else, capturing two enemy guns and two prisoners. He exclaimed happily, "I've never fought a war before, I never thought the enemy was such a pushover!" He climbed onto the city wall and shouted loudly, "Comrades, come on up!" Qiao Fafeng, a new soldier from Shahe in the Sixth Company, captured three guns. After the battle, a reporter visited the Fifth Company and found more than twenty new soldiers busily exchanging for new guns, all beaming with joy. (Ruo Qi)
