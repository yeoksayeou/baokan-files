Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 1st. Nantong, a village's review, simply emphasized the compensation of the interests of the middle peasants, neglected the demands of the poor and hired peasants, and affected the unity of the peasants. It has now been initially corrected and has gained the following experience: (1) Grasp the characteristics of the restored area. The review should be carried out through land restoration, rent reversal (that is, recovering the land and grain taken away by the local bullies during the Chiang occupation, such as in a group of ten households in the village, seven households were stripped of their land and rent). The leadership should first meet the requirements of the poor and hired peasants and solve their living difficulties, and then compensate the interests of the middle peasants from the confiscated property of the heinous landlords and traitors. (2) Strengthen the concept of poor and hired peasants. For example, during the review, the poor and hired peasants repeatedly asked the cadres: What if the land is taken away and the rent is collected? What if there is no food to eat? The cadres should be concerned and should not feel bothered. (3) When compensating the interests of the middle peasants, attention should be paid to avoiding the "pulling up seedlings to help them grow" bias that harms the interests of the poor and hired peasants. It must not become a "land return movement" for the poor and hired peasants.

　　南通某村复查经验：
    补偿中农损失
    注意贫雇利益
    【新华社华中一日电】南通某村复查单纯强调补偿中农利益，忽视贫雇农要求，影响农民团结，现已得到初步纠正，并获得如下经验：（一）掌握恢复地区特点。复查应通过复田，倒租（即收回在蒋占时被恶霸扒去的田和粮，如该村一个组十户中即有七户被扒田倒租），领导上应首先满足贫雇民要求，解决其生活困难，然后从没收罪大恶极的地主逆产中，补偿中农利益。（二）加强贫雇农观念，如复查中，贫雇农一再向干部提出：田被扒去，租被收去，怎么办？没粮吃怎么办？干部应予关切，不应觉得麻烦。（三）补偿中农利益时，应注意避免损害贫雇农利益的“倒拔蛇”偏向。更不可成为贫雇农的“退田运动”。
