　　Pingshun Anyang Village
　　Stop Transport, Advance Weeding
　　[This newspaper, Pingshun News] After the sowing was completed in the seventh district of Anyang Village, under the leadership and promotion of labor hero Cui Fubao, thirty-five laborers and twenty-eight animal powers collectively transported five times, earning a total of 270,000 yuan. On May 25th, Cui Fubao personally went to the field and pulled back a handful of millet seedlings to show the group members, such as Niu Qiunian and others. The seedlings had already grown to an inch high. You all still think it's too early to weed the seedlings. For example, Niu Zenghe of the group said: "In the past, the seedlings had to grow to half a foot high before weeding, because the soil roots were cold, and we were afraid that weeding too early would easily kill the seedlings and reduce the grain harvest in the autumn." After the problem was discovered, Cui Fubao first convened a meeting of the entire group, proposing to advance weeding to prevent labor shortages due to participation in the war and support for the front, and to prevent being unable to weed due to heavy rains, and to avoid being easily blown to death or dying of drought in dry weather. As the saying goes: Weeding millet at one inch is better than topdressing with fertilizer. This awakened everyone and decided to stop transportation, and a plan for advance weeding was drawn up: all eleven full and half laborers in the group would spend five days cutting firewood to burn for a month, starting on June 1st to weed the seedlings. The group's millet land is forty-two mu, with an average of three laborers per mu; the corn land is fifty-three mu, with one laborer per mu; and the miscellaneous grain land is nine mu, with a total of fifteen laborers. In total, one hundred and sixty-two laborers will be used, to be completed by June 18th. On the night of May 26th, a meeting of sixteen people, including the heads of mutual aid groups in the village, was convened to discuss weeding work. Under the leading promotion and influence of Cui Fubao's group, the entire village formulated an advance weeding plan. The village's six groups, with seventy-eight full and half laborers, have three hundred and twenty-seven mu of millet land, three hundred and eighty-eight mu of corn land, and twenty-two mu of miscellaneous grain land, using a total of one thousand four hundred and two laborers, to be completed within eighteen days.

　　[This newspaper, Xiyang News] After the Beizhuang base point completed sowing, it convened a meeting of all base point cadres to inspect spring plowing and sowing. During the discussion, various villages pointed out that in the rush to sow, some places did not cultivate deeply and carefully enough. Although full seedlings have now been captured, this shortcoming should still be remedied. It was decided to carry out fertilizer accumulation and prepare for one more weeding. A plan has now been drawn up: each woman will accumulate twelve dan of fertilizer in two months, mainly by using soap fire to burn and smoke the soil. Men dismantle pits to compost hair manure, guaranteeing an average of four dan of green manure per mu, ensuring one more weeding. (Xin Ying)
