　　Human and Animal Power Mobilized
    A Surge of Assistance to Agriculture in Various Institutions of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region
    [This newspaper's dispatch from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region on the 3rd] Various institutions in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are helping the masses with spring plowing. When the Fourth Sub-district Command moved to Kunwu XX Village, it coincided with the masses' concentrated effort to dig tunnels, which prevented them from dedicating all their labor to spring plowing. Therefore, the Command organized the five animals of the institution and the fifteen animals of the large cart team to assist in plowing. Deputy Commissioner Li also personally plowed barefoot, igniting a wave of enthusiasm for agricultural assistance among the institution's cadres. In five days, they plowed and harrowed 41 mu of land for military families and orphaned, elderly people without labor, planted 12 mu of sorghum, and hauled 3 carts of manure. The masses digging tunnels were deeply moved, saying, "The Deputy Commissioner is plowing for us; we must work harder digging!" When the aunt of military family member Zhang Mengfang saw Deputy Commissioner Li plowing her land, she said, "The Kuomintang soldiers want to eat and drink from the people, but the Eighth Route Army officials plow and work for the masses. The two sides are as different as heaven and earth. I will definitely write to my Mengfang and tell him, 'The Deputy Commissioner has plowed our land, so don't worry about home and fight Chiang Kai-shek well.'" The Qingfeng Second District stretcher team helped the masses with harrowing and plowing during lulls in the fighting, covering more than 20 mu. The cadres and miscellaneous personnel of the Fanxian Fourth District established a production team, and eight cadres, correspondents, and cooks went to the fields to help the masses, transplanting 30 mu of seedlings and carrying 60 loads of water in one day. Comrade Wang Jianqing had blisters on his hands but refused to rest.

    冀鲁豫各机关掀起助耕潮
    【本报冀鲁豫三日电】冀鲁豫各机关帮助群众进行春耕。四分区指挥部移驻昆吾××村时，正值群众突击挖掘地道，因而不能以全部劳力进行春耕，指挥部即将机关的五匹牲口及大车队的十五区牲口组织起来，进行助耕。李副专员亦亲自赤足扶犁，掀起了机关干部的助耕热潮，五天共给军属、孤寡无劳力的犁地、耙地四十一亩、高粱十二亩，拉粪三车。挖地道的群众大受感动说：“专员还给咱们犁地，咱们更得加油的挖呀！”军属张梦方的伯母在地里看见李副专员正在犁着她的地时她说：“遭殃军给老百姓要吃、要喝，八路官给群众犁地做活，两方比起来真是天上地下，我一定给俺梦方打信对他说：“专员把咱的地犁起来了，叫他不要挂念家，好好的打老蒋吧。”清丰二区担架队在战争空隙中帮助群众拉耙犁地，二十余亩。范县四区区部干杂人员，组织了生产组，干部通讯员伙夫等八人下地帮助群众，一天拔苗三十亩，打水六十担，王建清同志手上磨起了大泡，还不肯休息。
