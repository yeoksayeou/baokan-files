　　Shahe New District Anti-Drought Production Movement
    Xiaotian

    The Shahe New District's movement for prosperity through anti-drought production has been enthusiastically underway for twenty-six days after mobilization and promotion. The reasons for this are, first, that more than 2,500 liberated heroes, village cadres, militiamen, and activists have taken the lead. Secondly, the leadership's ideology has promoted the positive aspects of the masses' production for prosperity, and then overcome negative thoughts and concerns. The specific methods are:

    I. Combining top-down mass mobilization with bottom-up ideological mobilization. Supporting righteousness and overcoming evil, establishing the idea of prosperity through drought resistance, and creating a conducive atmosphere are the keys to launching a large-scale production movement. Top-down mobilization generally adopts a clear and affirmative attitude, explaining that: (1) In the old society, there was work but no food, and after liberation, everyone plans to become rich. (2) What one earns through labor belongs to oneself, and there is a guarantee of prosperity. (3) In the past, we united to take back the land and achieve liberation, and in the future, we will help each other in production to achieve liberation. After such mobilization, the masses' basic desire to become prosperous is aroused, relieving them of their ideological burdens and immediately responding to the call for production for prosperity and drought resistance. Following the mass mobilization, along with the rise of the masses' new ideas (production for prosperity), the already trained activists are promptly grasped, and, in accordance with the spirit of the mass mobilization, they lead the masses in bottom-up deliberation, creating a mass-based and enthusiastic atmosphere for production and prosperity. Generally, middle peasants connect with middle peasants, and poor peasants connect with poor peasants, using small group meetings or informal chats. Often, three or five sentences about plans for the future can play a significant role. For example, Shang Zheng brought it up during the arrangement of work in the mutual aid group in the evening, with some saying, "I want to buy a mule after the autumn harvest," and others saying, "With Wu Manyou as a comparison, I have to get a landlord's name in the end." Such a climate forms a movement, and half of the masses' negative concerns are automatically resolved.

    After the masses' ideology of labor for prosperity is mobilized, it should be grasped firmly, and the issue of how to resist drought and become prosperous should be thoroughly discussed among the masses. Further clarify the guiding principles for prosperity through production and drought resistance, and enlighten the consciousness of organizing, in order to break the psychological barrier of being unable to become prosperous and fearing drought resistance. In drought-stricken areas, people generally recall the tragic life of past disaster years, arousing drought resistance consciousness, followed by discussions on how to resist drought and prepare for famine, overcome pessimism and despair, and prepare tickets, food, and travel expenses to flee to Shanxi again. And use the masses' own experience to resolve the masses' drought threat and improve drought resistance confidence. In water areas, the general method of calculation removes the ideological obstacles of being unable to become prosperous due to lack of labor.

    II. Closely combining organization with ideological mobilization. Mobilization work is in the busy farming season, and after mobilization, the masses are eager to take action. Therefore, prolonged ideological mobilization is not good. Experience has proven that only by letting the masses take action will they believe in the reality of letting labor become prosperous. However, simply grasping mutual aid without ideological mobilization will not consolidate even if mutual aid is achieved. After voluntary organization of mutual aid, the first thing to do is to resolve the problems left over from last year's large-scale mutual aid. Depending on the different situations, accounts should be settled, debts repaid, or advantages and disadvantages clarified, and then resolved completely. Secondly, the issue of equivalent value should be gradually resolved, such as changing work according to the number of people, distributing dividends according to the number of donkeys, or recording work according to the land, formulating work tickets and work prices, etc., but it must be democratically discussed, and the group leader and staff should not monopolize or move the experience of the old areas.

    III. The exemplary leading role of village cadres, militiamen, and activists is the driving force for promoting the masses to embark on the second revolution and the happy pill for the masses to solve their concerns about production and prosperity. After the masses' ideology of prosperity through drought resistance is cleared, the cadres must stand up and take the lead. If the cadres do not act, the masses' panic cannot be dispelled. Experience has proven that wherever cadres and activists, big or small, take the spirit of anti-feudal struggle to lead the masses in production, the movement will be rapidly promoted. For example, the canal construction and irrigation in Xijiujia and the water carrying and cotton planting in Qinzhuang were all promoted by cadres taking the lead.

    IV. Launching commendation movements to enhance production enthusiasm. After the masses' labor for prosperity is initially mobilized and consciously acted upon, the masses' enthusiasm for production is immeasurable, but in order to more fully exert their enthusiasm, launching top-down and bottom-up commendation movements is the best method. Experience has proven that wherever the village blackboard newspaper, broadcasting station, and mass-based commendation and respect for models are combined, the production upsurge is particularly high. Xigequan praised Hao Xiaotan's mother for spinning nine taels of cotton in one day on the blackboard newspaper, and everyone was competing to spin more and strive to praise themselves. They said, "In the old society, I was bored at home all day, enduring humiliation and doing more work, and no one praised me. Now, not only the village knows, but the whole county is also famous."

　　沙河新区抗旱生产运动
    笑天
    沙河新区发家抗旱生产运动，经过二十六天动员与推动已热烈的闹起来了。所以如此，首先是二千五百多翻身英雄、村干部、民兵、及积极分子起了带头作用。其次领导思想上发扬了群众生产发家的积极面，而后克服消极思想和顾虑，具体作法是：
    一、自上而下大动员与自下而上思想发动相结合。扶持正气克服邪气，树立发家抗旱思想并造成风气，是发动大生产运动的锁链。自上而下的动员，一般都采取了明确肯定态度，说明了：（一）旧社会有做没吃，翻身后都打算闹富。（二）谁劳动来的是谁的，过富有保证。（三）过去团结收回土地翻身，今后互助生产翻身。这样动员之后，群众发家致富基本要求就被调动起来，卸下他们的思想包袱，立即响应生产发家抗旱的号召。在大动员之后，跟随着群众新思想的（生产发家）兴起，即抓紧已训练的积极分子，依大动员的精神，带领群众进行自下而上的酝酿，造成群众性热烈的生产发家空气。一般的是中农串通中农，贫农串通贫农，采取小组会或不拘形式的进行拉杂闲扯。往往用三五句打算过时光的话能起大作用。如上郑在晚上互助组按排活时，即拉起来了，有的说：“秋后要买骡子”，有的说：“有吴满有作比较，总得落个老财名”，这样的酿成风气形成运动，群众的消极顾虑就自解一半。
    当群众劳动发家思想调动起来之后，就应抓住不放，在群众中贯彻酝酿如何抗旱致富问题？进一步明确发家生产抗旱方针和启发组织起来的自觉，以打破不能发家畏缩抗旱心理。在旱地区，一般的回忆过去灾年的悲惨生活，引起抗旱自觉，继之讨论如何抗旱备荒，克服悲观失望和准备票子干粮盘费再逃亡山西的“地皮”思想。并以群众自己的经验解除群众旱灾威胁提高抗旱信心。在水地区，一般的用计算方法，扫除了劳力缺乏不能发家的思想障碍。
    二、组织起来与思想发动密切结合。动员工作处在农忙季节，群众在动员之后，就迫切要求行动起来，因此拖长了思想动员就会不好，经验证明：只有让群众行动起来，群众才会相信让劳动发家的真实性，但不进行思想动员而单纯去抓互助，即使互助起来，也不会巩固。自愿组织互助后，首先要解决去年大互助遗留下的问题，根据不同情况，算账还账或吃亏沾光说到明处，以后弄个一清二白加以解决。其次要逐渐的解决等价问题，如按人头变工，按驴尾巴分红，按地头记工，制定工票工价等，但须经民主讨论，组长工作人员不应包办或搬老区经验。
    三、村干部、民兵、积极分子的模范带头作用，是推动群众走上第二个革命的推动机和群众自解生产发家顾虑的开心丸，在群众发家抗旱思想打通之后，就得干部起来带头，干部不干，群众的恐慌心理是解除不了的。经验证明：凡是大小干部积极分子，拿出反封建斗争精神去领导群众干生产，运动就迅速的推开了，如西九家的修渠浇地，秦庄的担水点花等，都是干部带头推动的。
    四、开展表模运动提高生产热忱。在群众劳动发家一经初步动员自觉行动起来之后，群众的生产心劲是不可估量的，但为了更充分的发挥其心劲，开展自上而下自下而上的表模运动，则是最好的方法，经验证明：凡是那个村黑板报、广播台和群众性表模尊模风气相结合的，生产热潮就特别的高涨。西葛泉在黑板报上表扬了郝小滩娘一天纺九两花，大家都争着多纺，争取表表自己。她们说：“旧社会一天闷在家里，忍气吞声做多分活，谁也不称情，现在不仅村里知道，全县也有名”。
