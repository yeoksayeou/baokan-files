　　Prepare Early, Work Together
    Human Effort Will Overcome Drought
    Taihang First Special District Vigorously Organizes Drought Prevention
    [Our Newspaper] Special Commissioner Song of the Taihang First Special District reported to Chairman Yang Rong of the Border Region Government on the district's drought-resistant planting and conservation for famine preparation: "Western Hebei experiences drought nine years out of ten. As early as the February meeting of construction section chiefs convened by the Special District Office, and at the production symposiums with district and village cadres, ideological preparations for drought prevention were made. Before the Grain Rain solar term, telegrams were sent to various counties to organize the masses to carry water and plant cotton. At the end of April, formal instructions for cotton planting were issued. Currently, the plan to plant one mu of cotton for every ten mu of land in the entire district has been completed in most areas by carrying water for planting. We are currently planting corn and beans." The report continued: "The experience in mobilizing the area is that cadres and heroes play exemplary leading roles, encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for the fight against drought. The Special District Office even suspended office work for a day to help the stationed village open and repair a new canal, sparking a mass upsurge in canal construction. County Magistrate Lü of Neiqiu led all government personnel to carry water and plant eight mu of cotton in half a day, thereby prompting the masses in the town to take swift action. Ninety-five percent of all male, female, and semi-able-bodied people participated in carrying water for planting and promoted a concentrated planting campaign throughout the county. The Party, government, people, and cadres of Zanhuang went to the countryside separately to help the masses plant. The chairman of the Xuejiazhuang Farmers' Association in Lincheng said, "In the past, we resigned ourselves to fate, but now everything depends on the strength of the masses." He and the director of the Armed Forces Committee and three others organized mutual aid to complete the planting plan, leading to large-scale mutual aid throughout the village and first planting one mu of cotton for each military family." The report emphasized the current situation of drought resistance and famine preparation: (1) All counties have successively issued instructions for drought prevention and famine preparation. In addition to proposing the construction of water conservancy projects to expand irrigated areas, paying attention to carrying water to irrigate cotton, and protecting cotton seedlings, Xingtai also proposed preparing early for late crops such as buckwheat, millet, small corn, and small sorghum. (2) Various counties have begun to store substitute foods and wild vegetables. Guo Quanrong, chairman of the Shentou Farmers' Association in Neiqiu, and labor hero Hou Genzang called on all women in the family to carefully calculate accounts. Labor hero Tian Qingli of Lincheng has already started eating bran and vegetables. Village cadres in various areas have quit drinking and smoking to reduce waste. (3) Organize transportation for famine preparation. Zhangyu Village in Shahe has a total of one hundred livestock, half of which participate in transportation, transporting from the mountains to Yangfan every five days. The wages can feed four hundred people in the whole village for five days. Transporting six trips after the wheat harvest can solve one month's food supply. (Xiu Shan)
    [Our Newspaper] Cadres of Nanguokou Village in the Third District of Shexian County, took the lead in leading the masses to prevent drought and prepare for famine. The cadres first formulated a conservation plan. Cooperative Director Dou Xianming held a family meeting, asking his family to recall the famine situation in 1943 and save early. The whole family decided that in the past, five people and one livestock ate three catties of rice, four and a half catties of corn, and two taels of salt every day. In the future, it will be reduced to two catties and four taels of rice, three catties of corn, and one tael of salt. Calculated in this way, they can eat one more day in three days. His whole family also proposed: "Save one month early, live one more month," do not eat dry rice, change to rice soup with vegetable assistance. On the 26th of last month, a village-wide meeting of poor and hired peasants was held. The masses recognized the benefits of early savings from recalling the past experience of famine years. Li Chengshi said: "Let's not forget the pain after pulling out the knife. In the past, during famines, the cadres led us to borrow some food from the landlords. Now that the landlords are gone, we must work harder and not let the landlords laugh at us. Early savings is the way." After the meeting, most families in the village changed their meals.
