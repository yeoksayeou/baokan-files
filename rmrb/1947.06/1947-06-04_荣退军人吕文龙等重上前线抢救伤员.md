Retired Soldier Lü Wenlong and Others Return to the Front Line to Rescue the Wounded

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In the enthusiastic support from the rear to the front lines, retired soldiers Lü Wenlong and four others (who previously served as company and platoon leaders in the People's Liberation Army) voluntarily joined the Huguan militia and went to the battlefield. During the battle to besiege Anyang, on the 25th, when a certain unit attacked the textile factory, the enemy's artillery fire was heavy. The People's Liberation Army repeatedly advised them to stay behind in the rear for orders, but they quietly followed the troops to the front line, fought alongside the People's Liberation Army, and desperately rescued the wounded. They used a piggyback method, carrying the wounded from the innermost trenches, through the artillery fire, to the aid station. While carrying them, they tried their best to support the wounded, avoiding any bumps. They said, "Stretchers are big targets, but when we carry them on our backs, we are smaller targets." Because of their past training in the People's Liberation Army, they were good at moving under artillery fire and were particularly quick and safe. After rescuing them, Lü Wenlong also grasped the psychology of the wounded, using his own glorious wounding experience (he is a second-class disabled veteran) to explain and comfort the wounded. When our troops on the front line heard the news of the retired soldiers' enthusiastic participation in the war and their care for the wounded, they were deeply moved and further enhanced their fighting spirit!

　　荣退军人吕文龙等重上前线抢救伤员
    【本报特讯】后方热烈支援前线中，荣退军人吕文龙等五人，（原在人民解放军任过连长排长等职）自动参加壶关民兵开赴战地。在围困安阳的战斗中，二十五日某部攻击纺织厂时因敌人炮火浓重，人民解放军再三劝他们暂留阵后待命，然他们却悄悄跟在部队后面到了阵地，与解放军并肩作战，并拚命的救护伤员。他们用驮背方法，由最前线掩体内，冒着炮火转运至救护所。背的时候，并尽力扶侍着不叫伤员受一点震撞。他们说：“担架目标大，我们向下驮背目标小。”他们因过去经过在人民解放军里的锻炼，所以善于在炮火下运动，并特别迅速安全。抢救下来后，吕文龙还抓住伤员的心理，以自己光荣挂彩的（他是二等残废）经验，极力对伤员解释安慰。前线我军闻听荣退军人热烈参战、爱护伤员的消息，都深为感动，更提高了杀敌气焰！（李双德）
