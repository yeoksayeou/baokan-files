Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. According to TASS, Budapest: Since the formation of the new Hungarian government, the unity between the two working-class parties in Hungary—the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party—has become even closer. The two parties recently held mass meetings in the joint federations of various districts of Budapest to discuss the domestic political situation. At one mass meeting, Imre Szulik, a member of the Political Bureau of the Social Democratic Party, said in his speech: "We have gained freedom. Only through the joint efforts of the two workers' parties can we build an independent, free, and prosperous Hungary." Nikhazi Farkas, Deputy General Secretary of the Hungarian Communist Party, revealed: "The conspirator Farga fled to Austria after obtaining a passport to enter the American occupation zone with unprecedented speed." Under the slogans of "Unity" and "Finally Eradicating Reactionaries," the working people at the conferences unanimously adopted resolutions: welcoming the new government and demanding bank nationalization, property tax collection, prohibition of high prices, and the election of a new parliament. In addition, the liaison committee of the Social Democratic and Communist Parties held a meeting a few days ago and issued a communique stating that the two parties' views on the current political situation are completely consistent.

    共社两党团结更紧
    【新华社陕北八日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：自匈牙利新政府组成后，匈两工人阶级政党——共产党与社会民主党团结更形密切。两党顷在布达佩斯各区联合会召开群众大会，讨论国内政治形势。在一处群众大会上，社会民主党政治局委员伊姆耳·苏兹里克演说称：“我们已得到了自由。只有两个工人政党的联合努力，我们才能建立独立、自由、富强的匈牙利”。匈共副总书记尼海·法卡思揭露称：“阴谋家法尔加是以空前的迅速取得进入美占领区的护照而逃往奥地利的。”在“团结”和“最后根绝反动派”的口号下，各处大会上的劳动人民一致通过决议：欢迎新政府，并要求银行国有、征收财产税、取缔高物价及选举新国会等。又社共两党的联络委员会曾于日前开会并发表公报称：两党对目前政局的观点完全一致。
