　　Junxian Second District Cadres and Masses United as One
    Swearing an Oath in Blood to Persist in Land Distribution
    Not Only Obtain Land, But Also Protect It
    [Reported by This Newspaper] Junxian Second District is not only a newly recovered area, but also an area adjacent to the enemy. The enemy constantly harasses it, and general cadres believe that the masses are afraid of a change of regime and that it is impossible to implement land reform. Based on this situation, the leadership expressed its attitude to the masses, proposing: Under any circumstances, cadres will persist in the area, guarantee that land reform will enable everyone to obtain floating wealth and land, and guarantee that not only will land be distributed, but also that it will be protected. The masses expressed their willingness to accept this. However, the masses still had concerns, fearing that the cadres had not made up their minds, fearing that the situation was unstable, and fearing retaliation from landlords after a change of regime. Therefore, the leadership convened a district cadre meeting, first affirming the district cadres. Each district cadre expressed their attitude, made a plan, and issued a competition. Then they quickly went down to concentrate and control more than 150 landlords. Immediately, a farmers' meeting of more than 40 villages was convened, attended by more than 4,000 masses (women accounting for one-third). Because the cadres had expressed their attitude to the masses in the villages, and the government had issued a notice clearly stipulating who could participate in the meeting, proposing that the farmers' meeting was a "meeting of good people" and was completely legal, the masses dispelled their concerns. The leadership analyzed the situation, explained that the Eighth Route Army would definitely be able to gain a foothold, and also carried out class enlightenment. District and village cadres and activists took the lead in speaking about their sufferings, which aroused the masses to speak about their sufferings. Peasants and women in villages such as Houzhuang, Liuzhuang, and Wagang all burst into tears. In the midst of speaking about their sufferings, the masses were stirred up with hatred for the landlords. At this time, the leadership also proposed that landlords were not to be feared and that there was the strength to control them. After discussion by the masses, everyone's emotions rose. The masses in each village knelt down and swore an oath that if they were not united, did not follow, or withdrew halfway, they would die under enemy fire. The farmers' representatives from each village also knelt down, stating that if they did not lead everyone to work, or if they accepted bribes or surrendered, they would also die under enemy fire. The representatives and farmers made up their minds, expressed their attitude, and actively formulated plans. On the last day of the meeting, in order to further strengthen the masses' determination, the district cadres also expressed their attitude. The district head personally killed a chicken to swear an oath, and all the district cadres knelt down and swore: if they did not persist in the area, they would die under enemy fire. After the oath, they also drank black chicken blood as an oath. The masses from each village were very moved and took to the stage to announce their plans. After the meeting, after fierce struggle, a total of 319 households of landlords, rich peasants, and evil bullies in the entire district have been cleared out, with 14,178.6 mu of land, which has been distributed to 1,437 households (7,429 people) of extremely poor and poor peasants. In addition, 13,668 pieces of farm implements and utensils, 147 head of livestock, 1,421 houses, and 57 carts have been distributed to 3,541 households (14,713 people) of middle-poor peasants. After this movement, 70% of the masses in the entire district have been organized (the original population was 4,633 households, with a population of 20,813 people, and 3,541 households, with 14,713 people, participated in the organization), and 181 cadres have been promoted.

　　浚县二区干群齐心
    ＠血为盟坚持分田
    不仅分到手还要保得住
    【本报讯】浚县二区不仅是新收复区，而且是接敌区，敌人不断袭扰，一般干部认为群众怕变天，实行土地改革不可能。根据这一情况，领导上向群众表明态度，提出：在任何情况下干部坚持地区，保证土地改革使大家浮财土地分到手，保证不光分了田，而且保住田。群众表示敢要。但群众还有顾虑，怕干部决心未下，怕时局不稳，变天后地主报复。于是领导上召开了区干部会，首先坚定了区干部，每个区干部表明态度，作出计划，发出竞赛，又很快下去把一百五十多个地主集中起来加以控制。马上，召集了四十余村的农民大会，到四千余群众（妇女占三分之一），由于干部到村都向群众表明了态度，政府又出布告明确规定谁能参加大会，提出农民大会是“好人会”，是完全合法的，群众解除了顾虑。领导上分析了时局，说明八路军一定能站住脚，又作了阶级启发，区村干部积极分子首先带头诉苦，引起了群的诉苦。侯庄、刘庄、瓦岗等村农民妇女都大哭起来。诉苦中群众激起了对地主的仇恨。这时领导上又提出地主不可怕，有力量来控制。经过群众讨论，大家情绪高涨起来。各村群众纷纷跪下盟誓，如不团结，不跟着走，中途抽梯挂桥，死到枪弹之下。各村农民代表也跪下，说明自己如不领着大家干，如有受贿、投降，也是死在枪炮之下。代表和农民下了决心，表明了态度，纷纷订立计划，大会末一天，区干部为了更坚定群众，也表明了态度，区长亲自杀鸡盟誓，全体区干部跪下宣誓：如不坚持地区，死在枪炮之下，盟誓后，又喝乌鸡血为盟。全场各村群众非常感动，纷纷登台宣布自己计划。会后，经过激烈的斗争，全区地主、富农及恶霸坏分子共三百一十九户，已清算出土地一万四千一百七十八亩六分，分给了一千四百三十七户（七千四百二十九口）赤贫农与贫农。另外有一万三千六百六十八件农具与用具、一百四十七头牲口、一千四百廿一间房子、五十七辆马车分给了三千五百四十一户（一万四千七百一十三口人的）中贫农。经过这这次运动，全区百分之七十的群众组织起来，（原户口四千六百三十三户，人口二万零八百一十三人，参加组织的三千五百四十一户，一万四千七百一十三人），提拔了一百八十一个干部。（冀鲁豫日报）
