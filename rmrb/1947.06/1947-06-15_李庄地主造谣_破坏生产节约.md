　　Li Village Landlords Spread Rumors
    Sabotaging Production and Thrift
    Be Vigilant Against Landlord Conspiracies!
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] In Li Village, District One, landlord-special agent elements are sabotaging production and thrift, inciting peasants to eat, drink, and waste. Ge Sanwang, a peasant who has been emancipated and knows how to blacksmith, suffered a lifetime of hardship in the old society. Last winter, he thoroughly turned himself around. This spring, he has been diligently working (doing blacksmithing) from dawn till dusk and living very frugally. He said to others, "Chairman Mao led us to turn ourselves around. Now, production is for ourselves, so we must produce well and become prosperous." Later, he met Zhao Laoyou, a landlord-special agent, who secretly told Ge Sanwang, "You've been allocated so much land, housing, and furniture, and you also have a skill. Yet, you're working so hard, day and night. In a few years, you'll become the richest man in the whole village. Then, you'll end up like Liu Kentang in our village." (Liu Kentang was the first local tyrant landlord in Li Village, whose crimes were heinous and who was punished by the masses.) After his sabotage, Ge Sanwang developed a fear of becoming rich and stopped working hard. His family of three now eats at least one meal of noodles every day, consumes more than a dozen eggs, and eats meat every few days. Under his influence, many emancipated households have also become unthrifty and unlaborious. For example, Liu Gaozhou's wife doesn't spin or weave, likes to eat well and dress well, and spends 3,000 yuan on seven dou of rice to buy more than four zhang of cloth to wear. Even the shoes she wears are made by others. Furthermore, many landlords and special agents who have been overthrown are also spreading the word to the newly emancipated households: "If you don't become poor now, you may not be able to share the fruits in future struggles." The emancipated households believe that they will fight again when they are poor, and divide again when they are rich, because Chairman Mao won't let anyone starve to death. As a result, the whole village has become wasteful. At the beginning of last month, when the mobilization to advocate thrift began, it was impossible to implement it. People verbally agreed to be thrifty, but in reality, they still drank, ate meat, and shared meals together. After Comrade Zhao Mingqin, the director of public security, carefully investigated and studied the problem with the masses' thinking, he convened a village security conference with more than 300 men and women in attendance. On the spot, he exposed the landlord's instigation conspiracy and asked everyone to discuss whether Ge Sanwang and Liu Kentang were the same in essence? Are we really going to fight again when we are poor, and divide again when we are rich, fighting whoever is rich? Can we get rich by not working and relying on struggle? After three nights of group and collective discussions, everyone cleared their minds and realized that they had been fooled by the special agents. Ge Sanwang said, "Since I was sabotaged by the landlord-special agent, I don't know how much money I have produced less and how much money I have wasted. From now on, I must change! I will no longer be fooled by the landlord-special agents." After the meeting, the emancipated peasants were extremely resentful of the conspiracies of the special agents and landlords, and unanimously shouted to thoroughly overthrow the landlords. The enthusiasm for thrift and production to become prosperous has greatly increased. The destructive activities of the landlord-special agents are currently being investigated.

    [Report from this newspaper in Zuoquan] Nan Hui recently discovered in the drought resistance and planting inspection that landlords are counterattacking peasants to demand rent. The landlord, Gong Desheng, was weakened economically in last year's mass movement, but he did not lower his head politically because he relied on his son working in the county's finance and grain department. He often said sarcastic things on the street. Once, he borrowed farm tools from an emancipated peasant, and when the peasant said he was using them, he said, "These farm tools were mine last year, and you're still borrowing them from me!" In the middle of last month, he took a bag to demand rent from the emancipated peasant Liu Zhu, saying, "You wanted the land, so how can you not pay the rent you owed me last year?" After this problem was discovered, it aroused the vigilance of the peasants. It is now being carefully checked. (Fourth District Correspondent Group)

　　李庄地主造谣
    破坏生产节约
    警惕地主阴谋！
    【本报黎城讯】一区李庄村，地主特务分子破坏生产节约，挑拨农民吃喝浪费。翻身农民葛三旺会打铁，在旧社会中整动弹了一辈受了一辈罪，去冬翻透了身，今春生产（做铁匠活）起早搭黑很起劲，生活也很节省，他向别人说：“毛主席领导咱翻身，现在咱生产一个是咱一个，可得好好生产富根。”后遇特务地主赵老友暗地给葛三旺说：“你分了这么多的地、房、家具自己又会手艺，又这样不分黑明白地的干着，再过上不几年，你就成了全村的大老财，那你也和咱村刘肯堂的下场一样”。（刘肯堂是李庄村第一个恶霸地主，罪恶滔天，被群众惩办了）经他破坏，葛三旺就有了怕富思想，也不好好做活了，全家三口人每天最少吃一顿面，吃十余个鸡蛋，隔几日还吃一顿肉。在他影响下不少翻身户，也这样的不节约不劳动。如刘高周的老婆，不纺织好吃、好穿，用七大斗米三千元买布四丈多穿，自己穿的鞋也要别人做。还有不少斗垮的地主特务，也向新翻身户宣传：“现在你们不化穷，将来再斗争你们恐怕不能再分果实了。”翻身户都认为穷了再斗，伙了再分，反正毛主席不叫饿死一个人。这样全村就浪费起来。在上月初旬开始动员号召节约，怎也行不通，口头上要节约，但实际还是喝酒吃肉、吃合伙，经公安主任赵明勤同志细心调查、研究，发现了群众思想问题，便召集全村治安大会，到会的男女有三百余人，当场揭露地主挑拨阴谋，让大家讨论葛三旺和刘肯堂他们本质是否相同？我们是否就是穷了再斗，伙了再分谁富斗谁？不劳动靠斗争是否发了家？经过三晚上的分组和集体讨论，大家清醒头脑，了解上了特务当，葛三旺说：“我自被特务地主破坏后，不知道少生产了多少钱和浪费了多少钱，今后可得转转哩！不再上特务地主的当。”会后翻身农民对特务、地主的阴谋愤恨万分，一致嚷着彻底斗倒地主，节约生产发家致富情绪大大提高，现对地主特务的破坏活动正追查中。（庆堂、樊瑛、连江）
    【本报左权讯】南会最近在抗旱点种检查中，发现地主向农民反攻要租。地主巩德胜，去年群运中在经济上削弱了些，但在政治上并未低头，原因是仗凭他儿在县财粮科工作。他经常在街上说些风凉话，有一次他向翻身农民借农具，人家说俺正用哩！他就说去年这农具还是我的，你还来向我借哩！上月中旬他又拿上口袋向翻身农民刘珠要租，并说：“地你们要了，去年欠下我租还能不给？”这问题发现后，引起农民的警惕，现正注意深入检查。（四区通讯小组）
