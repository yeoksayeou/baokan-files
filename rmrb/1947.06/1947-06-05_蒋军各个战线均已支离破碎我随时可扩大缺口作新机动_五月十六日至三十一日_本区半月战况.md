　　Chiang Kai-shek's Armies on All Fronts Are Fragmented; We Can Expand the Gaps at Any Time to Create New Opportunities for Maneuver
    Half-Month War Situation in This Area, May 16th to 31st
    The second half of May was a relatively quiet half-month in terms of war situation on various fronts in this area. This lull exposed the serious weaknesses of Chiang Kai-shek's army on the entire Jinji-Luyu front. After continuous and powerful offensives by our army, Chiang's entire front had been fragmented and unable to move. We had taken the initiative in the past, and now we are even more in control, able to expand the gaps in the front at any time to create new opportunities for maneuver. Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters had long realized this crisis, but suffered from a lack of reserves and could not reorganize the front. Although he ordered Wang Zhonglian in northern Henan to gather eight brigades (including two brigades of the Reorganized 32nd Division, three brigades of the Reorganized 66th Division, one brigade of the Reorganized 15th Division, and two brigades of the Reorganized 3rd Division, many of which had been annihilated or defeated by us, and their quality had changed) to go north and relieve the siege of Anyang, Wang Zhonglian was afraid of being annihilated and hesitated to move forward. From May 16th, when he set out from Jixian, to May 31st, a full half-month, he remained stagnant on the line from Gao Village Station to Jixian, south of the Qi River, advancing a total of only fifty li.
    In southern Shanxi: After our army recovered nineteen county towns, it directly attacked the old nest of Yan Xishan's collusion with the enemy and opposition to the Communist Party during the eight years of the War of Resistance—western Shanxi, and captured Xiangning, Daning, and Fencheng in one fell swoop. Neither Hu Zongnan nor Yan Xishan could or would transfer a single soldier to reinforce. Chiang Kai-shek had no choice but to work day and night along the south and west banks of the Yellow River, from Luoyang in the east to Tongguan in the west and Yumenkou in the north, to rush to build so-called national defense works, and scraped together four regiments of troops to defend this long riverbank line that could not be defended and could not be guarded against.
    In this way, many peculiar land islands appeared around our area, the larger ones being Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Linfen, Anyang, and Yuncheng, and the smaller ones being Yongnian, Xiaxian, and Yuanshi. These islands, except for being able to maintain contact with their reactionary headquarters in the air, had all other connections cut off. They lacked food, ammunition, clothing, and supplies, and Chiang Kai-shek had to use airplanes to transport supplies to them every day, making Chiang Kai-shek's already insufficient air force even more exhausted and unable to cope. It is expected that in the future, this kind of isolated island will inevitably be produced in large numbers with the development of the war situation, and Chiang Kai-shek's main task in the future will only be placed on air transport, which is the most headache for him.
    On the enemy's rear battlefield, our Yu-Wan-Su People's Liberation Army continued to bravely launch active attacks and achieved successive victories. In May, it again captured the cities of Mengcheng and Weichuan, and achieved two brilliant victories at Jieshouji in the northwest of Shangqiu on the Wei (chuan) Yan (ling) highway, annihilating more than 1,200 enemies. In total, since January of this year, our army in Yu-Wan-Su has successively captured twelve cities, including Wuyang, Mengcheng, Taikang, Tongxu, Fugou, Xihua, Weishi, Qixian, Suixian, Ningling, Zhecheng, and Zhoujiakou, directly approaching the two main lines of Pinghan and Longhai, creating a model of guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear. Currently, the People's Liberation Army in this area has crossed the Wo River and Ying River, penetrated deep into northern Anhui, and threatened the empty heart of Chiang Kai-shek's army.

　　蒋军各个战线均已支离破碎我随时可扩大缺口作新机动
    五月十六日至三十一日
    本区半月战况
    五月下半月是本区各战线战况比较沉寂的半个月。这种沉寂，暴露了蒋军在整个晋冀鲁豫战线上的严重弱点，即蒋军经我连续强大攻势打击以后，其整个战线已支离破碎，动弹不得，我军过去取得主动，现在更是主动自如，随时可以扩张战线的缺口，作新的机动。蒋介石的统率部固早已体会到这一危机，但苦于后备无着，难以重整战线，虽曾令豫北的王仲廉集结八个旅（包括整三十二师两个旅，整六十六师三个旅，整十五师一个旅，整三师两个旅，其中不少已被我歼灭过或击溃过，其质已变）北上解安阳之围，但王仲廉唯恐被歼，迟迟不敢前进，从五月十六日自汲县出动，截至五月三十一日为止，整整半个月的时间，依然停滞于淇河以南高村车站至汲县之线，总共不过前进五十华里。
    晋南方面：自我军收复十九座县城以后，更直捣阎锡山抗战八年中勾敌反共的老巢——晋西，一举攻克乡宁、大宁、汾城三城，无论胡宗南或者阎锡山都没有也不能抽调一兵一卒前来增援，蒋介石只好沿黄河南岸西岸东起洛阳西至潼关北抵禹门口日夜加工赶修所谓国防工事，东抽西凑抽调四个团兵力来守备这漫长的守不胜守防不胜防的河岸线。
    这样，我区周围就出现了许多奇突的陆上孤岛，较大的有太原、石门、临汾、安阳、运城，小一点的还有永年、夏县、元氏。这些孤岛除在空中尚能与其反动大本营取得连络以外，其他连系，均告断绝。粮弹衣食无着，每天得由蒋介石用飞机给他们运送给养军需，使蒋介石本来不足的空军，更加疲惫不堪，应付不暇。预料今后这种孤岛必将随战争形势的发展大量产生，蒋介石的空军将来的主要任务，就只能放在空运上面，这是使他最头痛不过的事情。
    在敌后战场上我豫皖苏人民解放军，继续英勇的主动出击，连获数捷，五月份又攻入蒙城、洧川两城，并在洧（川）鄢（陵）公路与商邱西北的界首集取得两次辉煌胜利，歼敌一千二百余名。总计豫皖苏我军自今年一月以来，曾先后攻入温阳、蒙城、太康、通许、扶沟、西华、尉氏、杞县、睢县、宁陵、柘城、周家口等十二座城市，直逼平汉陇海两条干线，创造了敌后游击战争的范例，现该区人民解放军已越过涡河颖水、深入皖北，威胁蒋军空虚的心脏。
