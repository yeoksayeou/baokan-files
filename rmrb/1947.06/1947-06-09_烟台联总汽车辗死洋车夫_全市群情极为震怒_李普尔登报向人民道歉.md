Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th: The tragic incident in which an UNRRA staff member stationed in Yantai ran over and killed rickshaw puller Yang Lu-kui has caused outrage throughout Yantai. At approximately 5:00 PM on May 23rd, UNRRA staff member S. Luvic, driving a Jeep, sped south from the eastern end of Da Malu (Great Horse Road) onto Senlin Lu (Forest Road). Rickshaw puller Yang Lu-kui, seeing the vehicle approaching, immediately followed protocol and moved close to the side of the road. However, S. Luvic continued to speed recklessly, striking Yang Lu-kui, causing a one-to-two-inch laceration to the back of the head, brain matter spilling out, and crushing the front of the brain, abdomen, and legs, leaving a bloody and horrific scene. After causing the accident, S. Luvic not only failed to stop and render aid but instead turned the vehicle around and attempted to flee. A security guard from a certain organization immediately stepped forward and ordered him to transport the injured rickshaw puller to the French Hospital for emergency treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, Yang Lu-kui died at approximately 11:00 PM that evening. Upon hearing the news, Mayor Yao rushed to express condolences. The deceased rickshaw puller’s white-haired, fifty-year-old wife grabbed Mayor Yao’s clothing, and his twelve- or thirteen-year-old son knelt before him, crying and begging for justice. Mayor Yao immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to detain S. Luvic and his Jeep and to punish him according to the law. The entire city is outraged that UNRRA staff members, under the control of American imperialism, dared to treat the liberated areas with the same methods used in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, showing blatant disregard for the laws of the liberated areas government and a callous disregard for Chinese lives. On the morning of the 24th, the Municipal Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions first submitted documents to UNRRA representative Leeper stationed in Yantai, lodging a serious protest. The trade union also put forward five demands: (1) The perpetrator, S. Luvic, must pay with his life according to the law; (2) UNRRA must be responsible for the burial of the deceased; (3) All expenses related to the deceased's medical treatment and funeral arrangements must be borne by UNRRA; (4) The bereaved family must be compensated to ensure a certain standard of living; (5) A solemn statement must be published in the newspaper, guaranteeing that UNRRA personnel will never commit similar incidents again, and expressing an apology to the people of the liberated areas. At 2:00 PM, Yao Zhongming, Mayor of Yantai and concurrently Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the Jiaodong Administrative Office, held the first negotiation with Wang Leeper of the UNRRA Office in Yantai at the former Foreign Affairs Office, urging UNRRA to fulfill the five demands of the trade union. Mr. Leeper expressed deep regret for this incident and immediately established a Yang Lu-kui Funeral Committee composed of representatives from UNRRA, the government, and the bereaved family, issued an obituary, and held a public memorial service on the 26th to properly handle the aftermath.
    On the morning of the 26th, over 500 representatives from the Party, government, military, and people of Yantai City solemnly commemorated the tragic death of rickshaw puller Yang Lu-kui. After the ceremony, Mayor Yao and UNRRA's Leeper, among others, wearing black armbands, escorted the coffin for burial. On the 29th, UNRRA representative Leeper stationed in Yantai, following the trade union's request, specially published a solemn statement in the Yantai Daily, publicly apologizing to the people of the liberated areas, guaranteeing that similar incidents would not occur again, and agreeing to bear all funeral expenses. In addition, 100 US dollars were provided to cover the temporary living expenses of Yang Lu-kui's family. As for the living expenses of the deceased's wife and the educational expenses of the children, this would be fulfilled after the UNRRA China Branch agreed, and expressed deep respect and sympathy for the deceased's family. The perpetrator is currently under interrogation and is being dealt with.
