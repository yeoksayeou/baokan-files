　　[Report from this newspaper in Licheng] Baofang Village in the Second District, after summarizing the planting situation on the 27th of last month, studied the drought resistance struggle. However, the masses had the following thoughts: "The planting is done, the seedlings have taken root, we will harvest 30% of the crop even if only the seedlings appear, and it can't not rain." Another thought was: "Last year we turned over, and we were allocated land and grain! What are we afraid of?" Overall, there was a development of the complacent idea of "forgetting a hundred hunger pangs after one full meal." The leadership immediately seized on these thoughts and had everyone recall how they survived the famine of 1943. Woman Guo Xiaozhu said: "Speaking of the famine year, it was really bitter. A family of five survived the famine year on one dou of rice." Old Mother Liu Qiaozhen cried as she said: "Surviving the famine year was really hard. I thought about begging for food every day, but I couldn't even get scraps at the rich man's door." Then everyone compared 1943 with this year. Zhao Laixian said: "In the summer of 1943, after the wheat was harvested, people were still starving to death even at the bottom of the wheat ears. If it doesn't rain this year, it will be more serious than 1943." As everyone spoke, they developed a new understanding of this year's disaster. In order to fight the drought for a long time and save for future famine, everyone proposed to pick wild vegetables and eat more bran early on. Under the leadership of the cadres, accurate calculations were made, and a plan was drawn up. The whole village of 530 people, including 101 children who don't eat rice, needs to eat 10 liang of rice, 3 qian of salt, and 2 he of coarse grains per person per day. It is now decided that everyone will save 2 liang of rice, 1 qian of salt, and 1 he of coarse grains per day. In addition to eating the wild vegetables picked every day, 10 jin of dried vegetables will also be dried. Over half a year, 108 women will each spin one jin more of cotton per month than before to prepare to exchange for rice to survive the famine. After the meeting in the afternoon, groups of women went to pick wild vegetables. The next day, all the women and children in the village made a surprise attack and picked 150 jin of vegetables in one day. Men dug water cellars and cleaned water ponds. A vigorous drought resistance and famine preparation movement was formed in the whole village. Everyone worked together to save enough grain for half a year. (Zhao Yuan, Zhao Xi)
　　[Report from this newspaper in Yushe] On the 26th of last month, Xishan Village in Yushe discussed fighting the drought through economizing and preparing for famine at the people's school. In addition to actively rushing to plant, they also need to save a lot, plan for the long term, and launch a savings competition. Zhao Rong said: "I smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, and I often eat meat and drink wine. Just the cigarettes alone cost 28,800 yuan a year. After calculating, it's enough for my family of three to eat rice for a year. I waste the most in our village. In the future, in addition to saving, I will also actively produce and plan for the long term." Then everyone said: "There are 60 smokers in our village. If everyone saves two cigarettes a day, we can save six packs a day, 2,100 packs a year. Each pack costs 80 yuan, which can be exchanged for 28 shi and 1 dou of rice. If we support the front line, it will be enough for two companies of our troops to eat for more than a day." This shocking number broke through their idea that it doesn't matter if they waste. Finally, everyone proposed that the women be in charge. Everyone should save 1 he of rice per day, and the men should save two cigarettes. The rice saved should be taken out of the daily rice and put in a separate place. Check once a month to see who saves the most rice. Their slogan is "Save more, don't leave leftovers, the pot is empty and the belly is full."
　　[Report from this newspaper in Pingshun] On the 26th of last month, Hei Hu Village in the Seventh District held a meeting of all village cadres to discuss how to fight the drought and prepare for famine. During the discussion, it was asked whether there were households that did not have enough food or could not make it to the next season. The village cadres said: "After the rent reduction in the past winter, everyone has turned over completely, and all households without food have been eliminated." However, when ordering savings plans from house to house, it was discovered that there were 20 new middle peasant households and one old middle peasant household, totaling 73 people, who could not make it to the next season and did not have enough grain to last until the autumn harvest. After the problem was discovered, a meeting was held for grain-deficient households to discuss. The main reason was that there was no labor force in the family and no savings. Last autumn, a total of more than 150 shi of grain were harvested (including more than 40 shi of grain obtained from rent reduction). During the winter season, more than 19 shi of millet were used to exchange grain for cloth, and 16 shi of grain were returned. Twenty-seven shi of grain were used for medicine when sick. These three items alone accounted for 32.1%. Expenses for marrying wives and funerals, oil, salt, and other miscellaneous expenses are not included. Plans were immediately made for each household. In addition to self-transportation and weaving, they should save as much as possible to make up for the shortage. If it is still not enough, mutual assistance can be carried out. (Jianjie)

　　回想渡荒经验
    男女齐心节约
    黎城暴家脚全力抗旱
    【本报黎城讯】二区暴家脚于上月二十七日总结下种后，研究了抗旱斗争。但群众在思想上存在着：“种已下完，苗已作住，见苗收三分，天还不会不下雨。”一种是认为：“去年翻了身，分上土地粮食啦！怕什么。”总的看又发展了“一饱忘百饥”的自满思想。领导上立即抓住这些思想让大家回顾四三年灾荒如何渡过的；妇女郭小猪说：“提起荒年真是苦，一家五口人一斗米渡过荒年。”五十岁的老妈妈刘巧珍一面哭一面说：“过荒年，真难受，想每天要饭吃，不上老财门，糠菜也抓不住。”接着大家又把四三年和今年作了对比，赵来先说：“四三年夏天，收了麦子，当时是谷穗底下还饿死人，今年不下雨，比四三年厉害。”你也说，我也嚷，大家对今年灾荒，有了新认识后，为了长期抗旱节约备荒，大家提出要早采野菜多吃糠。在干部带头下做了精确计算，订出计划，全村五百三十口人，其中有不吃饭的小孩一百零一人，每人每日要吃米十两，盐三钱，杂粮二合。现决定每人每日节约米二两，盐一钱，杂粮一合，每天采野菜除吃外，还要晒十斤干菜，在半年一百零八个妇女每个人每月要比以前多纺一斤花准备渡荒换米吃。下午开罢会，一群群妇女就去采野菜，第二天全村妇女儿童突击一天内采菜一百五十斤，男人打水窖掏水池，全村轰轰烈烈的形成抗旱备荒运动，大家齐努力省下粮食要够半年用。（赵远、兆喜）
    【本报讯】上月二十六日榆社西山村在民校讨论节约备荒向旱灾作斗争；除积极抢种外，还要大量节约，长期打算，开展了节约竞赛，赵荣小说：“我一天一盒纸烟，酒肉时常吃，光算吃纸烟一年三百六十盒，费洋二万八千八百元，计算了一下，够俺家三口人一年吃米。咱村数我浪费，我今后除节约外，还要积极生产长期打算”。接着大家说：“咱全村有六十个吸烟的，每人一天节约两根烟，一天省六盒，一年省二千一百盒，每盒八十元，可换米二十八石一斗，要是支援前线够咱两连部队吃一天多”。这惊人的数目，打通了他们浪费不要紧的思想。最后大家提出妇女们掌握，每天每人节约米一合，男人省纸烟二根，节约米由每日下米拿出一把另外放到一处，一月检查一次，比赛看谁家节约米多少，他们口号是“多节约，不剩饭，锅干肚饱”。
    【本报平顺讯】七区黑虎村，于上月二十六日，召开全体村干部会，讨论怎样抗旱备荒，讨论中提出是否有不够吃和换不了季的户，村干部说：“经过去冬查减，都翻透身啦，没吃的户全部消灭。”但当挨户订节药计划中，即发现有新中农二十户，旧中农一户，共七十三口人换不了季，粮食接不到秋收。问题发现后，便召开缺粮户来讨论，主要是家里无劳动力，也没有积蓄下，去秋共收粮一百五十余石，（内有查减中得粮四十余石）在去冬换季时用粮换布用小米十九石多，又还借粮十六石，而生病吃药粮二十七石，光这三项就占了百分之三十二点一，娶媳妇发丧吃油盐等等杂支尚不在内。当即给各户订出计划，除自己运输纺织以外，尽量节约来弥补。再不够时可进行互济。（建杰）
