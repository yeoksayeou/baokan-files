Experiences in Participating in the Battle of Huguan

　　Huguan convened a cadre meeting of 49 people above the militia stretcher squad on May 9th, summarizing the following experiences and lessons learned from this participation in the battle:

　　1. The front and rear areas must maintain close contact and promptly convey various situations. Those at the front are most concerned about issues such as farming, fetching water, and carrying coal at home. The situation at the rear must be frequently communicated to everyone in order to stabilize the emotions at the front. At the same time, the living conditions and victory news from the front must be transmitted to the rear in a timely manner to encourage production enthusiasm in the rear.

　　2. When assigning cadres, select the people most loved and respected by the masses, those with the most prestige. Only in this way can they lead well. For example, in the Fifth District this time, strong cadres were assigned to the squads, platoons, and companies, resulting in very few desertions.

　　3. In leadership, it is necessary to: (1) Take the lead as cadres, and care for everyone's "thoughts" in daily life. For example, Wang Xiaodong and Fan Ducheng, cadres of the 11th and 12th companies in the Fifth District, led the entire team to rescue "Caihao" (translator's note: unclear meaning, possibly a code name or person) on the front lines and personally carried "Caihao" down. When team members were sick, they personally took care of them, resulting in no desertions in either team. (2) Promptly convey the situation and dispel everyone's ideological concerns. In the past, the fighting was always guerrilla warfare, but now that they were on the plains, many people were afraid when they heard the sound of cannons. The leadership should always tell everyone whose cannons were firing, how far away they were, etc. And pay attention to timely exposing special agents spreading rumors, stabilizing everyone's emotions. (3) Praise models and correct shortcomings at any time.

　　4. Plan carefully and prepare early before taking action. The masses participating in the war lack military knowledge and should adopt the "slow bird flies first" method and prepare in advance. For example, Yang Sugen, the cook of the 4th Company of the 3rd District, knew where the team was going and arrived early to sweep the yard clean, cook the food, and boil the water so that everyone could eat and drink water on time and complete their tasks on time.

　　5. Consciously formulate mass discipline. For example, Ma Qifu, the leader of the Fifth District company, led everyone to formulate their own discipline, which was executed particularly well, and they also built walls, carried manure, and hoed wheat for the masses, which won the enthusiastic support of the masses.

　　壶关参战经验
    壶关于五月九日召开了民兵担架中队以上四十九人的干部会议，总结了这次参战的几点经验教训：
    一、前后方要密切联系，及时传达各种情况。在前方的人最关心的是家里的种地、担水、挑煤等问题，要经常把后方的情况告诉大家，才能安定前方情绪。同时，把前方的生活情况及胜利消息随时传到后方，才能鼓舞后方的生产情绪。
    二、配备干部时要挑选群众最爱戴最有威信的人。这样才能领导好。如五区这次在班、分队、中队里都配备强有力的干部，结果开小差的很少。
    三、在领导上要做到：（一）干部带头，在日常生活中要照顾大家“摸心思”。如五区十一、十二中队干部王小东、范都城领导全队在火线上抢救彩号，并亲自把彩号背下来。队员们有了病，自己亲自侍候，结果两队没有一个开小差的。（二）及时传达情况，解除大家思想顾虑。过去一向打的是游击战，现在到了平原，不少人听见炮声就害怕，领导上应随时告诉大家这是谁家的炮响，离有多远等。并注意及时揭发特务造谣，安定大家情绪。（三）随时表扬模范、纠正缺点。
    四、行动之先要计划周密早作准备。参战群众缺少军事常识，应采取笨鸟先飞办法，预作准备。如三区四中队伙夫杨宿根，知道队伍向那里走时就提前走到，把院子扫净，饭做好水烧开，使大家能准时吃饭喝水，准时完成任务。
    五、自觉制定群众纪律，如五区中队马起富领导大家自己定出纪律，就执行的特别好，并给群众垒墙、担粪、锄麦，得到了群众的热烈拥护，用东西能
