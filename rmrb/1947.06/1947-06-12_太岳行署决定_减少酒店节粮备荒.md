　　Taiyue Administrative Office Decides to Reduce Hotels to Conserve Grain for Famine Relief
　　[This Dispatch] To conserve grain and help the masses prevent drought and prepare for famine, the Taiyue Administrative Office recently decided to reduce fourteen exclusively operated hotels in the heartland area. Fushan, Qinshui, and Yicheng are only allowed to establish one exclusively operated hotel per county. Counties along the Tongpu Railway line are not allowed to establish exclusively operated hotels due to expensive grain and fuel shortages. Private hotels in newly liberated areas must be ordered to close down or switch to other businesses in order to reduce the production of consumables, thereby achieving the goals of conserving grain and ensuring military and civilian food supplies.
　　[This Dispatch from Jinnan on the 10th] The Jinnan Third Administrative Office recently decided to put the grain stored in warehouses, distilleries, and government offices under the unified control of the Administrative Office to meet military needs. Distilleries have stopped brewing.

　　太岳行署决定
    减少酒店节粮备荒
    【本报讯】为了节约粮食，帮助群众防旱备荒，太岳行署近决定在腹心地区减少十四座专营酒店。浮山、沁水、翼城只准一县设立一个专营酒店；同蒲沿线各县因粮食贵、燃料缺、故不准设立专营酒店，新解放区原有之私人酒店，必须勒令停业或转业，以便减少消耗品之生产，进而达到节约粮食，保证军需民食的目的。
    【本报冀南十日电】冀南三专署顷决定将仓库及酒锅、机关存粮归专署统一掌握，以应军需。酒锅停烧。
