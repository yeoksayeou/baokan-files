Correspondent Li Jufu
Rotterdam

After the artillery fire started, the battalion command post sent a messenger, Li Jufu, to the front fortifications to relay orders. The enemy was still firing wildly, and Li Jufu ran forward through the hail of bullets. A bullet hit his right hand. He gritted his teeth, switched the gun to his left hand, and continued running forward. Another bullet flew by, grazing his leg. Li Jufu almost fell to the ground, but he still ran forward. He slung the gun over his back and crawled, supporting himself with one hand and one leg, finally reaching the front, relaying the battalion commander's orders. The medic wanted to apply medicine and bandage his wounds, but he refused, saying, "My mission isn't finished yet!" He just wanted to crawl back as soon as possible to report the situation of delivering the orders to the battalion commander. The enemy's artillery fire was still very fierce, but Li Jufu was not afraid at all. He just crawled resolutely and quickly. The bullets seemed to recognize him, hitting his buttocks. He cried out softly, almost stopping, but he thought: The battalion commander might already be getting impatient. He had never failed to complete a mission, and he would complete this one as well. His knees, elbows, even his buttocks and abdomen were scraped, but he crawled back without stopping, finally crawling back to the battalion command post. He couldn't stand up anymore, so he lay there, raising his head to report to the battalion commander: "Report to the battalion commander, the orders have been delivered as instructed, and the comrades are all ready, just waiting to hear the bugle call to launch the attack. Over." He saw a satisfied smile on the battalion commander's face, and he knew his mission was complete. He found a narrow and shallow trench and lay down quietly. The battle was intense, and the artillery fire was particularly heavy. He didn't want to delay others because of his injuries. He lay there, waiting. He lay there for most of the day, but he didn't even utter a groan. After the battle ended, he quietly said to the battalion commander, "Bring a stretcher, I really can't walk anymore." Only then did the battalion commander realize he had been wounded, personally helped him onto the stretcher, and said to him, "Comrade Li Jufu, today's mission was completed very well."

　　通讯员李聚福
    鹿特丹
    炮火打响以后，营指挥所派通讯员李聚福去前面工事里传达命令。敌人还在疯狂的打着枪，李聚福在枪林弹雨中往前跑，一颗子弹打中了他的右手，他咬了咬牙，把枪交给左手，继续向前跑，又一颗子弹飞来，腿上挂了彩。李聚福几乎倒在地上，但他还是往前跑，他把枪大背起来，用一只手和一支腿支掌着爬行，终于爬到了，传达了营长的命令。卫生员要给他上药捆伤，他拒绝说“我的任务还没有完成咧！”他只想早一点爬回来，向营长汇报传达命令的情形。敌人的炮火，仍然很猛烈，李聚福却一点也不胆怯，它只是坚决地迅速地爬。子弹像认得了他似的，又打上他的屁股，他轻轻叫了一声，几乎停下来，可是他想：营长或者已经等得不耐烦了。他从来没有完不成的任务，这一回仍然要完成。磕膝、手肘甚至臀部、腹部都擦伤了，他一步不停地往回爬，终于爬回了营指挥所。他已经站不起来，就那么躺着扬起头向营长作报告：“报告营长，命令已照样传达，同志们都准备好了，只等听号音，就发起冲锋，完结。”他看见营长脸上露出满意的笑容，他知道他的任务完成了，便找到一段窄又浅的交通壕，静静地躺下来；战斗正紧，炮火尤猛，他不愿因为自己的伤去耽误别人的事。他躺着，等待着，他躺了大半天，但他连哼也没有哼一声。战斗结束了，他才静静地对营长说：“来一付担架吧，我实在走不动了。”营长这时才知道他挂了彩，亲自扶他上了担架，对他说：“李聚福同志，今天的任务完成得很好。”
