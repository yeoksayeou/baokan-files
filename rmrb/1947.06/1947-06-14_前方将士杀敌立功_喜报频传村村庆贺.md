The frontline soldiers fought bravely and achieved meritorious deeds, and the masses in the rear celebrated their achievements everywhere. In Qin’s Village and five other villages in the seventh district of Lingchuan, ten heroes emerged one after another. As the commendation certificates kept coming, the masses were overjoyed. The district headquarters specially established a commendation celebration committee to hold a joint celebration meeting. County Magistrate Wang also came to express his congratulations in person. The masses said excitedly: "One person's merit is the glory of the entire village." The masses in Chengguan, Licheng, gathered in a procession more than a mile long to celebrate the meritorious deeds of Wang Yuanxin and Ma Renhe in the Tangyin battle. Qiushuyuan Village hung a plaque for the family of meritorious soldier Yang Liantang. In late May, Ren Village received commendation certificates from Shen Fuqi and Zhang Tiancai. Two pieces of good news arrived at the village, and the whole village rejoiced. Fuqi's mother was so happy that she didn't sleep all night, and Tiancai's sixty-year-old mother wore a bright red glorious flower on her chest. The congratulatory words sent by the government agencies read: "The front digs up the old roots, the rear plants the roots of wealth, we all work together, and overthrow Chiang Kai-shek." The masses of Langou congratulated Peng Linxi for his meritorious service, and the whole village wanted to achieve meritorious service in production, with the front and rear competing with each other. Li Yuanhai of Nansong Village in Changzhi established first-class meritorious service in the battle to annihilate the Second Rapid Column of Chiang's army. More than 800 people in the village gathered to congratulate him. Two commendation plaques were hung in Xiguxian Village in one day. Combat hero Zhang Xiaotu personally carried back eleven Zhongzheng rifles in the Tangyin battle. Su Deshun captured five Chiang soldiers alive and was selected as the top hero of the entire company. People from Zhangzhuangqiao in Handan gathered to celebrate the combat hero Li Mengsheng.
