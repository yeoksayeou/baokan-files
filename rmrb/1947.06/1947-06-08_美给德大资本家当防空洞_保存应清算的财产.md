Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th: TASS, Moscow: The "Pravda" recently published an article by Malinin, which stated: American capital in Germany has grown significantly. American capitalists are very active in Germany, they not only attempt to destroy the competition from German companies, but also attempt to gain a more solid foothold in the German economy, and transform Germany from a pre-war economic rival into a completely obedient and loyal partner. To achieve this goal, the first step for American manufacturers is to obtain command of the financial and industrial concerns and enterprises of pre-war American investment; in addition, American companies are using the excuse of American ownership to obtain ownership of the largest possible amount of German assets. This policy also receives a sympathetic response from German capitalists. German financial and industrial giants believe that the reconstruction and expansion of the Anglo-American position is an opportunity to preserve their own industrial concerns, because according to Article 12 of the Potsdam Agreement, these concerns should be liquidated. American merchants are trying their best to prove that their pre-war investment in Germany was three or four times more than the actual amount. For example, the total amount of American investment in Germany issued under American license reached 1 billion US dollars. The Berlin newspaper "Der Spiegel" claimed that the American occupation authorities gave various American merchants extensive opportunities to enter Germany.

　　美给德大资本家当防空洞
    保存应清算的财产
    【新华社陕北四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表马利宁所撰之论文略称：美国在德资本有极大生长，美国资本家在德国非常活跃，他们不仅企图毁掉德国公司的竞争，而且企图在德国经济中得到更稳固的立足点，并将德国自战前之经济劲敌地位转为完全服从的忠实伙计。为达到此目的，美国制造家的第一步，是取得对战前美国投资之财政与工业康采仑及企业之指挥权；此外美国公司正使用美国所有权的借口来取得最大量德国资产的所有权。此种政策亦得到德国资本家的同情响应，德国财政与工业巨头认为英美地位的重建与扩张，是保存自己工业康采仑的机会，因为根据波茨顿决议第十二条，这些康采仑按理应清算的。美国商人们正企图竭力证明他们战前在德国之投资较实际多三、四倍，例如在美国特许下发行之美国在德投资总数达十亿元。柏林《斯庇格》报声称，美国占领当局给予各种美国商人以广泛打进德国的机会。
