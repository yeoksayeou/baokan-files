How to Overcome Work Chaos?
    Reasonable Division of Labor, Clear Responsibilities, Letting Go and Developing Cadre Creativity
    Nan Dong Village, Changzhi, Changes Leadership Methods
    [This newspaper Changzhi News] In order to support the front lines in preparing for the great counter-offensive, the rear areas have heavier tasks. Calculating the labor exchange accounts between the front and rear, organizing mutual aid, and launching surprise attacks on summer harvesting and weeding, and collecting taxes, contracts, and military shoes are all squeezed together. Some village cadres feel overwhelmed, and because the steps are rushed, the work results are not great. Nan Dong Village in the Second District of Changzhi convened a village-wide cadre meeting to study the reasons. After detailed examination, it was discovered that the reasons for working hard without success were: First, there were many tasks and little time. Leaders were afraid to let go boldly, fearing that the tasks would not be completed and fearing that the work would not be done correctly, resulting in a large number of cadres becoming dependent. Second, there was no focus or specific plan for the work; whatever came, they would do, resulting in a chaotic grabbing with no beginning or end. Third, there was no clear system and reasonable division of labor; good deeds were not praised, and bad deeds were not criticized, allowing things to drift, and failing to unleash initiative. After careful study by all cadres, solutions were found: First, rectify the Production Research Committee, strengthen leadership, re-allocate cadres, and clearly stipulate the work tasks of each department. These include: Labor and Livestock Adjustment and Labor Exchange Department, Technology Research Department, Textile Department, and Propaganda Investigation and Statistics Department. In addition, a commando department was set up to make surprise attacks on temporary work such as taxes, contracts, and collecting military shoes. Second, strengthen the leadership of each street, set up a small street office in each street, and similarly set up the above departments. Cadres of the village Production Committee were specifically assigned to go deep into each street to help with the work, cultivate the independent working ability of the cadres under the street, and give full play to their initiative. Third, miscellaneous matters in the village and civil disputes were handled by ten administrative cadres taking turns on duty. Fourth, establish and improve the meeting and summary commendation system. The village Production Committee held meetings every three, six, and nine days to report on work and exchange experiences. Every five and ten days, each group studied the work and established a systematic concept. The street-level Production Research Group discussed work every night after dinner, summarized work every fifteen days, selected models, commended models, and put forward work tasks for the next fifteen days.

　　如何克服工作混乱现象？
    合理分工明确责任放手发扬干部创造
    长治南董村改变领导方法
    【本报长治讯】为了支援前线准备大反攻，后方任务较重，算前后方变工账、组织互助、突击夏收锄苗、税契收军鞋等任务挤在一起，部分村干部感到忙不过来，且因步骤忙乱，工作成绩亦不大。长治二区南董村便召开全村干部会议，研究原因、经过详细检讨，发觉劳而无功的原因：一、任务多时间短，领导上不敢大胆放手，怕任务完不成怕干的不对，结果养成了大批干部的依靠性。二、工作没重点没具体计划，啥来干啥，成了有头没尾的乱抓。三、没有明确的制度和合理的分工；好的不表扬，坏的不教育，任其自流，发挥不了积极性。经全体干部细心研究，找出解决办法：首先整顿生产研究委员会，加强领导，重行配备干部，明确规定各部门的工作任务。计有：劳、畜力调剂变工部、技术研究部、纺织部、宣传调查统计部，另设突击部突击每个时期临时工作如税契、收军鞋等。二、加强每街的领导，每街设一小街公所，同样设以上各部，村生产委员会干部具体分工深入各街帮助工作，培养街下干部的独立工作能力，发挥其积极性。三、村中杂事与民间纠纷，由十个行政干部轮流值日负责。四、建立与健全会议与总结表扬制度。每三、六、九日全村生产委员会开会，汇报工作交流经验。每逢五、十日各组研究工作树立系统观念。街下生产研究小组则每日晚饭后交谈工作，每十五天总结工作，选模范，表扬模范，并提出后十五天的工作任务。
