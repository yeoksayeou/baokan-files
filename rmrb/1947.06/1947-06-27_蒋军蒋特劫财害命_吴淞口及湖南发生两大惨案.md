Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th—Chiang Kai-shek's army "river patrol" in Wusongkou pushed eighty-two merchants from Funing, Northern Jiangsu, into the Yangtze River simultaneously, robbing them of their wealth and taking their lives, creating a major tragedy. Xu Daxing, Tao An, and other merchants from that county hired four seagoing vessels last winter, fully loaded with cured pork and eggs, and set sail from Bada Jiahaikou in Northern Jiangsu for Shanghai. On November 23rd, as they entered Wusongkou, they were suddenly ordered to stop for inspection by Chiang Kai-shek's army "river patrol." Seeing the abundance of cargo, the patrol tied up the merchants and transported the goods onto a small steamer. A "battalion commander" requested instructions from his superiors on how to deal with the merchants, and the reply came back: "Turn them all into dumplings." At dawn the next day, more than thirty members of the "river patrol," armed with sharp blades and led by the "battalion commander," asked Xu Daxing whether he wanted to die whole or be chopped to pieces. Xu and the others looked back at the vast river, knowing their doom was upon them. They immediately knelt down and cried out in unison: They were willing to give up the goods, but begged for their lives. The "river patrol" paid no heed, and with a command, one by one they were thrown into the river, their cries and curses echoing in the sky. At that time, Xu Daxing's younger sister, Xu Da Guniang, was about to be thrown into the river when the "battalion commander" saw her and was seized by lust. He ordered her to be kept back and that night took her to a place north of the river and forced her to marry him. Xu Da Guniang, having witnessed the tragic deaths of her father, brothers, nephews, and fellow villagers, was heartbroken. On the third day, she seized an opportunity to escape and secretly went to Shanghai. She recently returned to her hometown and recounted her ordeal. The victims' families, who had been suspicious after half a year of silence, fearing the worst, burst into tears upon hearing of this catastrophe. Li San Zhuang’s master Li, upon hearing of the death of his only son, wept day and night, shouting madly, "Chiang Kai-shek, give me back my son!" He is now near insanity.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—Shanghai newspapers report: A robbery and murder tragedy occurred in Shaoyang, Hunan, at the beginning of last month. On the morning of May 4th, a fire suddenly broke out at the Yonghe Gold Shop in Shaoyang, burning one apprentice to death, killing one shop assistant, poisoning six others, and stealing over a hundred taels of gold. According to shop assistants who recovered from the poisoning and testified to the court, Fu Deming, the "Special Conference Secretary" of the Sixth District Commissioner's Office, came to the shop to inspect on the evening of the 3rd, entering all the rooms. He produced an order from the Commissioner's Office, saying, "The people in your shop are all suspected of being 'communist bandits!'" He then forced everyone to eat a package of pills, saying, "These are 'truth pills'; after eating them, you will tell the truth." But after eating them, everyone fell into a coma, and the tragedy occurred the next morning. The incident caused an uproar throughout the province, and public sentiment was furious, unanimously calling for the severe punishment of the perpetrators. The Shaoyang All-Circles Support Yonghe Gold Shop Committee was formed. However, Secretary Fu Deming, under the instigation and protection of the Chiang Kai-shek commissioner Sun Zuoqi, initially attempted to publish announcements in newspapers to blame it on "communist bandits setting a trap." Under the pressure of public outrage, the Chiang Kai-shek court initially released him on bail and then re-arrested him, but the case has not been dealt with to this day.

　　蒋军蒋特劫财害命
    吴淞口及湖南发生两大惨案
    【新华社华中二十五日电】吴淞口蒋军“巡江队”将苏北阜（宁）东八十二个商人同时推下长江，劫财害命，造成大惨案。该县商人徐大兴、陶安等去冬雇海船四艘满载腌猪、鸡蛋由苏北八大家海口起航赴沪，十一月二十三日入吴淞口时，忽遇蒋军“巡江队”喝令停船搜查，该队见货物累累，即将人捆绑，将货物运上小火轮，由一“营长”向其上司请示处理商人办法，回令“全部下汤圆子”。次日黎明，“巡江队”三十余人，手执利刃，由“营长”率领问徐大兴要全尸还是碎死，徐等举首回顾，江水茫茫，知已大难临头，当即跪下，齐声哭求：货物甘愿不要，但求饶命。“巡江队”毫不介意，一声令下，一个个被投入江内，哭喊叫骂之声，响彻云霄。是时徐大兴胞妹徐大姑娘，正被投江，忽为“营长”看见，顿起淫念，喝令留下；当晚押至江北某地强迫结婚。徐大姑娘目睹父兄侄儿乡里等八十二人已惨遭谋害，肝肠寸断，遂于第三天乘机逃出，潜赴上海。最近始回乡痛述被难经过。遇难家属正疑半载无讯，恐有不测，闻此巨祸，顿时号啕大哭，备极凄惨。李三庄李老爷惊闻独子丧命，日夜啼哭，狂呼：“蒋介石还我儿子！”已近于疯痴。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】沪报讯：湖南邵阳上月初发生劫财害命惨案：五月四日晨，邵阳永和金号突被大火烧死学徒一人，杀死店员一人，中毒六人，被劫黄金百余两。据毒轻复苏之店员向法院供称：三日晚六区专署“特种会报秘书”傅德明至店检查，穿房入室，当出示专署命令说：“你们店中的人，都有‘奸匪’嫌疑！”继强迫每人吃丸药一包说：“此系真心丸，吃后可吐真言。”但吃后各人昏迷不醒，次晨即发生惨案。此案发生后全省哗然，群情愤怒，一致呼吁严惩凶犯，并组成邵阳各界声援永和金号委员会。但该秘书傅德明在蒋记专员孙佐齐主使庇护下，初竟在各报刊出启事企图诿为“奸匪构陷”。在群情激愤下，蒋记法院始将传放而复押，但迄今仍未处理。
