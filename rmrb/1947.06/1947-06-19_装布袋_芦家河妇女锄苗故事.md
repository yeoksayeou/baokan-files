The women of Lujia River in Yanshan have improved their weeding speed, averaging six to seven fen of millet per person per day. Word spread to Dongfeng Town, and some people were skeptical. Some even wanted to go to Lujia River to see how it was done, while other villages, finding it difficult to organize women, wanted to learn from Lujia River's experience. On May 31st, Shangguan Shuangzhen, who came from a hired-hand background in Dongfeng, passed by Lujia River and went to the fields with Lu Sihe, the village's production committee member. Lu Sihe told him, "This time, most of the weeding is being done by women, and they're really fast. The whole village's millet will be weeded in six days." Shuangzhen immediately said, "They have two hands, and so do I. I'm from a hired-hand background, I'm not afraid of keeping up with them!" Sihe smiled and said, "If you compete with the women, they'll definitely stuff you in a sack!" (meaning the women would all weed ahead and leave him behind). Shuangzhen still didn't believe it, so he went to the fields to compete. It was in the afternoon, and the women were all in the fields. Shuangzhen saw that there were even women in their forties, and he said to Sihe, "Can she even keep up?" He immediately started hoeing. Lu Hua'e, a woman, was in first place, Shuangzhen was second, Wang Yueying was third, and Lu Sihe was fourth. As soon as the hoes started moving, Shuangzhen kept up, not even having time to see if others were hoeing well, just shouting, "Hoeing badly doesn't count!" But everyone was hoeing better than him. After two or three hoes, the women saw through Shuangzhen's abilities, added a little more effort, and made him panic. His legs were shaking and he was out of breath. He turned to Sihe and said, "Women are really capable." But that delay allowed Wang Yueying, who was behind him, to catch up. Thus, Shuangzhen began to be stuffed into the sack. From then on, his spirit weakened, and the sack fell farther and farther behind, until the women hoed to the end of the field, then hoed back, and he was still behind the second person. At this point, Shuangzhen lowered his head, admitting that the women hoed faster than him, and announced that he was going back to Dongfeng. But Wang Yueying rushed forward and stopped him, saying, "What did you say this morning? Didn't you say you also have two hands...?" Then everyone shouted, "Welcome Shuangzhen to keep up!" A burst of applause shook the air. Shuangzhen had never fallen behind anyone in work before, but today he was behind the women, and they were welcoming him to catch up, which made him feel dazed and his face turned red. He thought, "I never lost face when working for the landlord, so how can I go back today, stuffed in a sack!" Suddenly, he understood a big problem. In the past, we weren't farming for ourselves, maybe that's why we weren't so motivated! In the past, everyone worked separately, but today it's because we're organized! In the past, women were not capable, but today women are better than me, maybe it's because the Communist Party has liberated them! As it got dark, he went back to Dongfeng convinced, and the people in Dongfeng Town were sincerely going to learn from Lujia River's women's organization from then on. (Taiyue Dispatch, 17th)

　　“装布袋”
    芦家河妇女锄苗故事
    岩山芦家河妇女锄地速度提高了，每天平均一个人就能锄谷六、七分，风声传到董封镇上，有些人心中很怀疑，有人竟想到芦家河看一看究竟怎样，也有些村因为妇女不易组织起来，想跟芦家河学些经验。五月卅一日，董封做长工出身的上官双珍路经芦家河，便和该村生产委员芦思河一道上地去看，芦思河先告诉他说：“这次锄谷大部分由妇女负责，人家锄得实在快，六天全村谷就要锄完。”双珍立刻说：“她们两只手，我也两只手，我是长工出身还怕顶不上她们！”思河张口笑着说：“你如和妇女们竞赛，她们一定要把你装进布袋内！”（意思说妇女们都能锄到头里，把他丢在后面），双珍仍是不信，于是上地去竞赛了，时间正是下午，妇女们都到了地内，双珍看见当中还有四十多岁的妇女，便向着思河说：“她还能吃住劲？”立刻就下锄了，妇女芦花娥是第一，第二就是双珍，第三个是王月英，第四个是芦思河。锄头一动，双珍紧跟，连别人锄得好坏都来不及看，只是嘴喊：“锄不好不算”。可是大家都比他锄的好哩。连着两三锄下来，妇女们识破双珍的本领，稍稍加点油，弄的他发荒了，腿也抖擞的有些累，前气接不上后气，就回头对思河说了一句“妇女就是能干”，可是耽误这一下，在后面的王月英呼呼的赶到他头里去了，于是双珍开始被装进了布袋。从此心劲松了，布袋也越掉越远，直到妇女们锄到地头，再往过锄回来，还把他留在第二人的后面。这时双珍低头了，承认妇女比他锄的快，宣布要回董封，但是王月英抢上顶住说：“你上午说啥，不是你也有两只手吗………？”于是大家齐喊：“欢迎双珍跟上！”一阵掌声震耳，双珍从来做活没落过人后，今日却落在妇女后面，欢迎他跟上，弄的心怔怔的，脸也红了，他想：“过去住主家没有丢过人，今日怎样回去呢，装到布袋里了！”忽然他了解了一个大问题，咱过去种地不是给自己种，大概是情绪不高吧！过去各干各，今天是组织起来的缘故吧！过去妇女不行，今日妇女赛过自己，大概是共产党解放了她们吧！天快黑时，他心服口服的回董封去了，董封镇上的人们从此也诚心的要向芦家河妇女组织起来学习。（太岳十七日电）
