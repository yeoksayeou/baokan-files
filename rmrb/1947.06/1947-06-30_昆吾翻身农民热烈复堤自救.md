[This article transmitted by] This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] dispatch on the 28th: The men and women, young and old, of Kunwu County are vying to join the dike restoration front, and the enthusiasm for dike restoration and self-help is unprecedentedly high. The county originally planned for 2,000 people to participate in dike restoration, but the actual number reached 4,508. They realized that the border region's finances and food were difficult, and unanimously refused work grain, bringing their own supplies. Xin Keju, an emancipated peasant from Xinlou in the Third District, first proposed donating two *shi* of wheat at the dike restoration mobilization meeting. He said, "I am 45 years old this year, and I have been a farmhand for landlords since I was 18. I couldn't even afford a wife. This year, after emancipation, I got 9.5 *mu* of land, and the 6 *mu* of wheat yielded more than two *shi*. I am willing to donate it to the dike-building workers in our village to save the superior's wheat and grain." The entire audience stood up and cheered, shouting, "Don't take a grain of grain from the public, don't spend a penny from the village!" The upsurge of saving during dike repair immediately unfolded throughout the county. The seven Chinese and Western medicine doctors participating in the dike restoration proposed donating medicine. Mr. Feng Shangu and others donated six kinds of medicines, worth 6,000 yuan. The leadership paid attention to combining dike repair with commending models and meritorious deeds, and selected a large number of dike repair model heroes. The masses' enthusiasm for dike repair was even higher. Women also participated in dike repair, pushing soil and refusing to be outdone by men. In the Third District, 130 women, in addition to helping men cook and water, also went to the dike to push soil, add grass, and pull carts, and competed with men. The 60-year-old female village head of Gaozhai, in addition to cooking and boiling water for the men, also went to the dike to add soil and pull carts. Ninety-two family members of soldiers in the Sixth District, who originally had no dike repair tasks, also volunteered to work on the dike. County and district cadres also pushed soil and repaired dikes with the masses, and the masses' enthusiasm was even greater. The entire county's project exceeded the task in only five days. The county saved a total of more than 970,000 *jin* of rice and more than 120,000 *jin* of firewood. On the 11th of this month, the command held a model commendation meeting to celebrate the victory of the dike restoration.

[This article transmitted by] This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region] dispatch on the 28th: A large number of dike repair models have emerged in Kunwu County. Zhu Yonglian of the Second District has not dropped a single cart since the dike restoration. Both of his shoulders are swollen from the pressure. In addition to actively working himself, he also used meal breaks to help others plan and think of ways. He constantly helped, criticized, and supervised those who were being lazy and not working properly. In his neighborhood, some people were not working well and were given a "wind-checking flag." He was so angry that he cried, "We must pull out the 'wind-checking flag'!" He stirred up the whole neighborhood, and they went to the dike with a burst of energy. When inspecting the work at night, everyone's eyes were bloodshot. Dou Lou and Xing Dian pushed the soil with even greater vigor, and the model flag was often planted on their pushcarts. Women also demonstrated a high degree of exemplary role in participating in dike repair. Long Fengying, a woman from Weimiao in the First District, voluntarily signed up for dike repair and pushed soil and pulled carts with the men. The men were moved and worked even more actively. In the Third District alone, more than 130 women participated in dike repair.
