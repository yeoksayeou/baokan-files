[This report from the Yubei Front, dated 10th by our newspaper] Guan Laishun, a military dependent from Huguan, lectured his son at a soldiers' meeting of the Second Battalion of the 213th Regiment on the 3rd. Guan Laishun, a military dependent, came to the front lines in February to visit his son, Guan Quanhui. Upon arriving at the unit, he learned that Guan Quanhui had deserted and returned home the day before, but was sent back to the unit the same night by the militia. The next day, at a soldiers' meeting, Guan Laishun publicly rebuked Guan Quanhui for being disloyal and unfilial, and explained that since Quanhui joined the army, his family had been allocated an additional five and a half mu of land, three dan of grain, and two sheep. The village had resolved all their difficulties. He asked Quanhui, "Think, who are we fighting Chiang Kai-shek for? If you desert and go home, and don't see things through to the end, that is being disloyal and unfilial." He became so impassioned that he shed tears. Guan Quanhui publicly admitted his mistake to his father and vowed to guarantee that he would work hard to achieve merit in combat in the future to atone for his previous error.

　　军属关来顺前线教子
    关全会认错保证立功
    【本报豫北前线十日电】二一三部二营三日召开军人大会，壶关军属关来顺当场训子。军属关来顺于二月来前线看望他的儿子关全会，到达部队后始知关全会已在前一天逃跑回家，同日夜又被民兵送回部队。关来顺次日在军人大会上，亲斥关全会为不忠不孝，并说明他家自全会参军后，又分得了五亩半地，三石粮食，两只羊。一切困难村里都给解决。他问全会道：“你想想，打蒋介石是为的谁？你逃跑回家，做事不到底，就是不忠不孝。”他激昂得流下眼泪来。关全会当众向他的父亲承认错误，并誓言保证今后要好好在战斗中立功，以赎前错。
