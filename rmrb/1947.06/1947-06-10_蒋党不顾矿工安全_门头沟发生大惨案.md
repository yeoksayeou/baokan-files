Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin-Cha-Ji] 7th: A major tragedy has continuously occurred at the Mentougou coal mine, a famous coal mining area in western Hebei, resulting in the deaths of over 190 miners. Since the Kuomintang secret agents occupied Mentougou, they have been embezzling for their own gain and completely disregarding safety measures in the mine shafts, leaving the miners' lives with absolutely no guarantee of safety. At 12:00 PM on the 16th, the entire rock ceiling, over two *li* long, in the south stone gate of the 900-foot level of the Zhongxing Mine collapsed, crushing over 130 workers inside the shaft to death. Only one person narrowly escaped at the entrance of the stone gate. At 10:00 AM on the 17th, the rock ceiling, one *li* long, in the three round ramps, No. 6 cabinet, and No. 9 cabinet of the open-pit coal mine of the Zhongxing Mine suddenly collapsed again, crushing over 50 workers to death. So far, only over 30 corpses have been found, all crushed into a bloody pulp, a ghastly sight to behold. After the fellow workers suffered this tragedy, the Chiang Kai-shek 工会 [gonghui - trade union] secret agent running dogs were even more devoid of humanity and took the opportunity to steal the workers' compensation money. They threatened the foremen of each mine, saying that if the workers' family members came looking, they should say that the workers had already left the mine. The more than 50,000 workers in Mentougou are gnashing their teeth in hatred at this crime and are leaving the mine one after another to work in small private mines to show their resistance.

　　蒋党不顾矿工安全
    门头沟发生大惨案
    【新华社晋察冀七日电】平西著名煤矿区之门头沟煤矿连续发生大惨案，死工人一百九十余名。自国民党特务盘据门头沟以来，贪污肥己，丝毫不顾窑下保险建设，以致矿工生命安全毫无保障。十六日下午十二时，中兴矿九百尺南石门，全长二里多的大石顶整个陷落，压死窑内工人一百三十余人，只有一人在石门口侥幸脱险。十七日上午十时，中兴矿明煤的三道轮子坡、六号柜、九号柜等地，全长一里的大石顶，又突然陷落，压死工人五十余人，至今才找出尸首三十多具，均已被压成活烂泥，血肉模糊，惨不忍睹。工友们遭此惨祸后，蒋记工会特务走狗更丧尽人性，趁此窃取工人恤金。他们威胁各厂工头说，如果工人家属找来，就说工人早已离开此矿。门头沟五万多工人对此种罪行，切齿痛恨，纷纷离开该矿，到小窑做工，以示抗拒。
