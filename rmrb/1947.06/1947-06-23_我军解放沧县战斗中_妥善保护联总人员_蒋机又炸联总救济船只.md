　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinpu Front, 21st: Our correspondent Qu Jiang reports: A certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army, in the battle to capture Cangxian Railway Station at 9:00 am on the 13th, properly protected 32 UNRRA staff members temporarily residing there (including five American and French staff members, and the rest were Chinese). The Liberation Army immediately dispatched troops to assist in guarding the relief supplies. After the UNRRA personnel checked the relief supplies stored there, they told reporters, "All the relief supplies were undamaged." Before the People's Liberation Army attacked the city on the 14th, it also shielded them from leaving the front line and temporarily evacuated to the south of Cangxian City. At noon on the 15th, the People's Liberation Army used three trucks to send all UNRRA staff and luggage to the UNRRA branch office in Bozhen. It is reported that they will return to Cangxian in a few days to carry out their work as usual.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st: Los Angeles radio broadcast: The UNRRA representative in China protested to the Chiang Kai-shek government yesterday about Kuomintang aircraft attacking UNRRA ships heading to the Liberated Areas. In the past five days, Kuomintang aircraft have fiercely bombed UNRRA ships three times. On June 14, four Kuomintang government aircraft bombed the Yantai Wharf, at which time UNRRA ships were unloading goods at the wharf.
