Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army has announced a comprehensive battle report for the first half of June (June 1st to 15th), stating that the People's Liberation Army expanded its counter-offensive in Northeast China (mainly Southern Manchuria) during the first half of June, recovering vast areas of lost territory and railway lines. Counter-offensives were also launched in Hebei and Rehe, recovering many towns and most of the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Ye-Chi Railway, and cutting off the Beijing-Shenyang and northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railways. In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, the victorious self-defense counter-offensive continued. In Western Shanxi, Xiangling was liberated, and in Taiyue, Pinglu and Hongdong county towns were recovered. Other liberated areas are actively preparing for counter-offensives. A total of 24 cities were recovered and liberated, including Xifeng, Xinbin, Qingyuan, Yitong, Fengcheng, Andong, Gaiping, Xiuyan, Kuandian, Xi'an, Kaiyuan, Benxi, Zhuanghe, Fuxian in Northeast China, Chifeng, Jianping, Ningcheng in Rehe, Qingxian, Cangxian, Yongqing in Hebei, Xiangling, Hongdong, Pinglu in Shanxi, and Heshui in Gansu. More than 20,000 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops were annihilated. Chiang's army only briefly invaded the city of Bao'an in northern Shaanxi once.

　　After the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Hailong Chaoyang Town on the Shenyang-Hailong line on the evening of May 30th, after three days and nights of fierce pursuit battles, the entire Chiang Kai-shek army's 60th Army Temporary 21st Division, which was retreating towards Changchun, was completely annihilated in the Jichang Town area southeast of Shuangyang County. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek army's 60th Army 182nd Division, which was coming to aid from Jilin, had one of its battalions annihilated in Shuanghe Town south of Jilin. On the 1st, our army recovered Xifeng County Town southeast of Siping Street. On the 2nd, we also recovered Yitong County Town northeast of Siping Street. At the same time, we attacked Xi'an County Town southeast of Siping Street. The defending Chiang Kai-shek army's Youth 2nd Division abandoned the city and fled in two routes towards Siping Street. We immediately pursued and annihilated one route, capturing more than 1,500 prisoners, and continued to rout the other route. At this point, we had completely controlled 300 miles of the railway from the outskirts of Siping Street to Meihekou. On the morning of the 3rd, our army recovered Xi'an City. On the same morning, a unit of our army recovered Kaiyuan County Town and its station, 200 miles northeast of Shenyang, thus completely controlling 170 miles of the railway between the southern suburbs of Siping Street and Kaiyuan, connecting the West Manchuria and South Manchuria liberated areas into one, completing the encirclement of Siping Street. On the 10th, we began to attack Siping Airport, and at 8 a.m. the next day, we annihilated its defending 71st Army Transport Battalion and one battalion of the Security Regiment, and the airport was occupied by us.

　　After the South Manchuria Democratic Allied Army recovered Qingyuan County Town east of Fushun and Xinbin County Town south of it on the 3rd, it continued to attack south, recovering Kuandian County Town, 150 miles northeast of Andong, and Fengcheng north of Andong on the 7th, and Andong City, the capital of Andong Province and an important port, on the 10th. The offensive developed northward along the Anshan-Shenyang line, and on the 11th, it successively captured the four stations of Lianshanguan, Xiaheitang, Qiaotou, and Nanfen, annihilating a part of the Chiang Kai-shek army. On the 13th, it captured Benxi City, the center of heavy industry, coal, and iron in Northeast China, and Gongyuan Station south of it in one fell swoop, controlling more than 300 miles of the Anshan-Shenyang line, and Shenyang was threatened. The Liaonan Democratic Allied Army recovered Pulandian on the southern section of the Changda Railway on the 4th, recovered Xiuyan County Town on the 5th, and continued to recover Zhuanghe, Fuxian, and Gaiping County Towns and the important station of Xiongyuecheng, controlling 300 miles of the Gaiping-Pulandian railway on the Changda Railway, and liberated vast areas of the Liaodong Peninsula. At this point, the entire Andong Province had been re-liberated, and more than 800 miles of coastline from Andong to Pikou and Gaiping to Fuxian had been controlled. The situation in Northeast China has greatly changed.

　　The Rehe Liberation Army also launched a powerful counter-offensive, recovering the important strategic point of Chifeng City in northern Rehe on the 5th. On the 6th, Heishui Town southeast of Chifeng was recovered, and on the 8th, Jianping County Town southeast of Chifeng and Ningcheng south of it, and Tianyi Station on the Chifeng-Yebaishou line, were recovered, pressing towards the Jinzhou-Chengde Railway. In the Guo Jiatun area northwest of Fengning on the 2nd, the West Rehe Liberation Army annihilated most of the more than 400 troops of Fu Zuoyi's 14th Corps (now changed to the 2nd Regiment of the 4th Division), killing more than 140 people, including Regiment Commander Wang Wanzhong.

　　The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army launched a counter-offensive between Jinghai and Cangxian on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway on the 12th. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, Qingxian County Town, 160 miles south of Tianjin, and Chen Guantun, Tang Guantun, Machang, Xingji, Yao Guantun, Jiedi, Cangxian and other stations were liberated, controlling more than 200 miles of railway. Xu Guantun, Gao Guantun, Caishikou, important strongholds of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops on both sides of the railway, and Da Wazi Tou, more than 20 miles west of Jinghai City, and Da Li and Bakou, 20 miles south of Tianjin, were also liberated. All the defending enemies were annihilated. At dawn on the 15th, Cangxian County Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek army on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, was liberated, and the entire 6th Column of the Chiang Kai-shek and puppet Hebei Security Forces was annihilated. At the same time, another unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army cut off the railway between Yangcun and Luofa and between Chadian and Chegu on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway on the 12th. On the night of the 13th, Yongqing County Town on the south side of the Beijing-Shenyang line was recovered, and the entire 3rd Column of the puppet Security Forces was annihilated. Another unit cut off the Caohe Railway Bridge 20 miles north of Baoding, and traffic on the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and traffic on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway were interrupted.

　　The militiamen in the Central Hebei and Southern Hebei areas actively operated around Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, and the Pingjinbao triangle area to cooperate with the main force in combat. In the past half month, they fought more than 80 times, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 4,100 Yan Xishan army security regiment independent columns and Ba County, Xincheng and other Chiang Kai-shek and puppet security teams, and capturing more than 2,500 people, including Liu Fengquan, deputy commander of the Chiang Kai-shek Ba County Security Forces. The enemy and our situation in the Pingjinbao triangle area has greatly changed. Chiang Kai-shek and puppet strongholds such as Gu'an and Shengfang and Wangqingtuo west of Tianjin are completely isolated.

　　The West Shanxi Liberation Army liberated Xiangling County Town southwest of Linfen on the 4th, and on the same day, the Taiyue Liberation Army recovered Hongdong County Town, and on the 6th, it recovered Pinglu County Town, and the ferry crossing on the Yellow River was once again controlled by us.

　　After the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberation Army annihilated one regiment each of the Chiang Kai-shek army's Temporary 60th Brigade and Cavalry 2nd Brigade north of Qingyang in eastern Gansu, on the 2nd of this month, it recovered Chiang Kai-shek army strongholds such as San Shi Li Pu, Ma Ling, Qu Zi, and Mu Bo between Qingyang and Huanxian, and broke the entire 160-mile blockade line mentioned above. On the 13th, Heshui County Town and Xihuachi, a major town belonging to Heshui County, were recovered. On the 14th and 15th, the enemy troops on the periphery of Huanxian were wiped out, and the Bian detachment under the 60th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek 81st Division and one regiment each of the 35th Brigade and the Cavalry 2nd Brigade were routed. On the 3rd of this month, the Guanzhong Guerrilla, in coordination with the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 6th Cavalry Division, attacked Taibaozi northwest of Xunyi, annihilating 200 Chiang Kai-shek Xunyi County Government in exile and self-defense forces. At this point, the entire territory of Xunyi, except for the isolated stronghold of Zhitian Town, was completely liberated.
