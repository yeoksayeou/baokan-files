Short Commentary:

	Seize the Time for Crash Planting

	This spring's erratic rainfall has greatly increased the difficulty of our spring plowing and planting. However, it is worth mentioning that all parts of our region have simultaneously launched mass movements to prevent drought and prepare for famine, encouraging and utilizing the creativity and tenacity of the masses, carrying water to plant and rush-planting and replanting. "If the water doesn't penetrate, the well won't dry up, keep carrying it," "People don't wait for rain, fight against drought, plant one more, eat one more," cadres and masses worked together to overcome and defeat the difficulties brought by the drought, and the achievements are great.

	However, it cannot be ignored that in many places, due to insufficient leadership and the failure to promptly overcome the masses' wait-for-rain paralysis, the planting work has not been completed well, and even most of the land has not been planted. From the perspective of the solar term, the summer solstice has passed, planting is already late, and doing everything possible to rush-plant can no longer be delayed! In areas where some rain has fallen, we should strive to plant everything without leaving an acre of bare land; in areas where it has not rained, we should continue to utilize the experience of carrying water to plant and rush-planting, planting as much as possible. In some places, the land that was watered and planted or rushed-planted while it was damp, although it has not seen rain to this day, is already full of seedlings; while the unplanted land, if we do not immediately think of a solution, once the time has passed, it will be impossible to plant even if we want to.

	We hope that all localities can conduct an inspection of the planting work and, based on the specific situation, conduct careful organization and not relax any opportunity to lead the masses to complete the planting. The spirit of comrades such as Gan of Qixian County and Li Xin, Secretary of Yongnian County, who seized the time to lead the masses to plant, is worth promoting at all levels of leadership. "To do a good job, it all depends on the leadership," this summary by the masses of Licun Gou in Lucheng can be used as a reference for all localities.

### 抓紧时间抢种

　　抓紧时间抢种
    今春雨水失调，曾给我们春耕下种工作增加了很大困难。但值得提出的，是我区各地不约而同的都及时开展了群众性的防旱备荒运动，鼓励与发挥了群众的创造性与顽强性，担水点种，抢种补种，“下不透，井不干，一直担”，“人不等雨，向旱灾作斗争，多栽一棵，多吃一颗”，干部群众一齐动手，克服与战胜了天旱给予的这种困难，成绩很大。
    但不容忽视，至今还有不少地方，由于领导上抓得不够紧，群众的等雨麻痹思想未及时克服，下种工作完成的还不很好，甚至大部土地还未种上，从节令上看，夏至已过，种地已迟，想尽一切办法抢种已不能再事拖延了！已经下了一些雨的地方，应该争取全部种上，不留一亩白地；没有下雨的地方，仍应继续发挥点种抢种的经验，多种一棵是一棵。有的地方担水点种或趁垧抢种的土地，虽至今仍未见雨，但已青苗满地；而未种上的土地，如不即刻想办法，时机一过，想种也不可能了。
    我们希望各地对下种工作能有一个检查，根据具体情况进行认真的组织，不放松一点时机领导群众完成下种。像企之县干与永年县书李新同志等，抓紧时机领导群众下种的精神，值得在各级领导上都发扬起来。“要想搞好，全靠领导”，潞城李村沟群众的这个总结，可供各地借镜。
