Failure to Eradicate Evil Leads to Disaster
    Two Thousand People in Wen County's Second District Sacrifice to Martyrs with Blood
    [Report from this newspaper] On the eighth of this month, over two thousand people from the second district of Tangyin County gathered to publicly commemorate the masses who were killed during the enemy occupation. After the public memorial, the masses immediately began to pour out their grievances. The chairman of the farmers' association outside the west gate recounted that when the Kuomintang troops occupied the area, his wife was killed and said: "Because I led the masses to turn over, my wife was killed by them. I can only take revenge." He also recalled past struggles, saying: "Before, I didn't carry out the struggle thoroughly in our village and showed leniency to the local bullies. As a result, we left behind a bad person. When the Kuomintang troops came this time, one landlord killed five of us. Thinking about it, the struggle must not leave any room for evil. In the future, the struggle cannot leave any hidden dangers. Leaving hidden dangers will bring no peace." Then Cui Fengting ran onto the stage and said: "I used to do business outside since I was little. Later, I returned home to farm, but because the years were bad, I fled to another village. Later, when I came back, all my family's belongings had been taken away by the local bullies. When the Eighth Route Army came, I became the chairman and led the poor people to struggle against the bad people. As a result, I had hatred with the traitors. This time, as soon as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops came, they captured my mother, tortured her severely, poured three or four basins of cold water on her, and finally shot her four times in the left waist, killing her. The local bullies were not satisfied and stripped off her clothes and threw her into the river." Speaking to this point, he was heartbroken, tears streaming down his face, and he cried bitterly. Finally, he said: "My family has no one left, and I am destitute. Today, I can only rely on everyone. If everyone supports me, I can live. Today, I must take revenge and lead our poor people to turn over again. We must not be soft on them!" At this time, slogans such as "Let's poor people unite to support him!" and "Avenge the bitterness of his mother's death!" broke through the clouds.
    At 5 p.m., the public trial began for a blood sacrifice. Nine traitorous and murderous villains, arranged in three rows, walked before the spirit tablets. The first three were the murderers who dug out Comrade Xiangyun's heart. One by one, they knelt before the spirit tablets, with the masses staring intently at these heinous criminals. After the trial, Minister Zhang announced the crimes of the chief culprits. The masses shouted, demanding that the government uphold justice, avenge the dead, and execute the murderers in a blood sacrifice. The government immediately accepted the people's opinions and executed them separately. The first three were sacrificed with blood before the spirit tablets, and the last six evil traitors were executed on the spot by firing squad to relieve the hatred in the hearts of the masses. Finally, Comrade Hou Songlin, representative of the Wen County Party Committee, gave a detailed explanation of the Party's policies today and called on everyone to thoroughly turn over in the future in order to defend our democratic world. This was followed by speeches by Section Chief Wang and Minister Liu. Finally, a funeral procession was held. (Wen County Battle Farmers' Small Newspaper)
    [Report from this newspaper, Wen County] From May 23rd to 29th, the mass movement in Wen County developed extremely rapidly. Of the county's six districts and 240 natural villages, 112 natural villages have now carried out anti-reverse accounting struggles, accounting for 46% of the county's villages. There were 119 struggles, with over 20,000 people participating. The morale of cadres throughout the county is extremely high. The County Party Committee summarized the mass movement for one week and drew the following three main experiences: (1) If cadres are determined to persevere, the movement can be launched; Village ×× in the fifth district is 15 li away from Qinyang City and is located on the Wen-Qin highway. The enemy often comes, and the environment is turbulent, but because district cadres such as Li Qingxiang are determined to stay in the village and are determined to mobilize the masses, the results are very good. The ×× area in the third district also has the same experience. The struggles in many villages have proved that as long as the cadres are determined to persevere, the movement can be launched. (2) Pouring out grievances and connecting with each other is the main link in mobilizing the masses. Pouring out grievances means accusing the landlords, bullies, and chief culprits of reverse accounting of their crimes, arousing the masses and igniting the flames of revenge, and clearly defining the line between the enemy and us. The seven days have proved that where pouring out grievances is done well, the movement is launched fiercely. In the fifth district, because the pouring out of grievances was done well in the training class, 38 of the 47 natural villages in the district have launched the movement. (3) Universally arresting traitors, bullies, and landlords means supporting the peasant class and upholding justice. Su Wang in the sixth district and Wuliyuan and Fangtou in the first district have all proved that the practice of arresting first and then launching the struggle to pour out grievances is correct. The movement is still continuing fiercely throughout the county. (Zhipeng, Changlong)

　　没斗彻底造成祸根
    温县二区两千群众血祭烈士
    【本报讯】本月八号汤阴二区两千余群众集会公祭敌占期间被害群众。公祭毕，群众立即展开诉苦。西城外农会主席诉到他当主席这次顽军占后，他的女人被杀时说：“因为我领导群众翻身我女人被他们杀死了，我只有报仇”。他并回忆了过去的斗争说：“以前我在俺村斗争不彻底，还给恶霸留情，结果留了一个坏人，这次顽军来，地主一个杀了咱五个，想起来斗争绝不能留情，以后斗争可不能留祸根，留下祸根不能太平。”接着崔风亭跑上台说：“我自小在外作买卖，后来回家种地，因年景不好，又逃外乡，后来回来，家的东西都被恶霸们拿走了，八路军来我当了主席，领导穷人斗争坏人，结果和奸霸们有了仇气，这次蒋贼顽军一来将我母亲捉住，严刑拷打，灌了三四盆冷水，最后在左腰上打了四枪打死，恶霸还不死心，又将衣服脱光，扔到河里。”话说至此，心痛如焚，泪流满面，痛哭失声，最后他说：“我家一个人也没有了，无依无靠，今天我只有靠大家，大家给我作主，我就能活。我今天一定要报仇，一定还要领导咱穷人翻身，不能软给他！”此时“咱们穷人团结起来给他作主！”“他妈死的苦给他报仇”等口号冲破云宵。
    下午五点时开庭公审，进行血祭，九个奸霸凶手排了三行走进灵前，头三个就是挖祥云同志心的凶手，他们一个一个的跪在灵前，群众目不转睛的看着这万恶罪人。审毕，张部长宣布祸首罪状，群众高呼要求政府作主，为死者报仇，将凶手举行血祭，政府当即接受群众意见，分别处决，头三个灵前血祭，后六个奸恶就地执行枪决，以解群众心头之恨。最后由温县县委代表侯松林同志将今天党的政策作了详细解释，并号召大家今后要彻底翻身，才能保卫咱们民主天下。继由王科长、刘部长讲话，最后并举行送灵游行。（温县战斗农民小报）
    【本报温县讯】自五月二十三日至二十九日之一周间，温县群运发展极为迅速。全县六个区，有二百四十个自然村，现已有一百一十二个自然村进行了反倒算斗争，占全县村庄的百分之四十六。斗争次数一百十九次，参加斗争人数在二万以上，全县干部情绪至为高涨，县委总结一周群运，得出以下三个主要经验：（一）干部决心坚持，运动就能开展；五区××庄离沁阳城十五里，位于温、沁公路上，敌人常到，环境动荡，但由于区干部李庆祥等坚决坚持住在村里，决心发动群众，结果成绩很好。三区××一带，也是接敌区获得同样经验，许多村庄的斗争都证明，只要干部决心坚持，运动就能开展。（二）诉苦串通，是发动群众的主要环节，诉苦即是控告地主、恶霸、倒算祸首的罪恶，激动群众燃起复仇火焰，划清敌我界限，七天中证明那里诉苦搞的好，那里运动就开展得猛烈。五区由于训练班中诉苦搞的好，全区四十七个自然村，已有三十八个村庄开展。（三）普遍扣捕奸霸、地主，即是对农民阶级的撑腰作主。六区苏王、一区五里远、方头等地，都证明，先扣捕而后发动诉苦斗争的作法是正确的，现全县运动仍在继续猛烈开展中。（志鹏、昌隆）
