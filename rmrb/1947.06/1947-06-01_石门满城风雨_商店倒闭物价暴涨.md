　　[This article was] transmitted by [an unstated news agency from] Huolu: Since our army liberated Zhengding and Luancheng, cutting off the Shijiazhuang-Yuan's [Yuan Shikai] Railway and the Zhengtai [Zhengding to Taiyuan] Railway, Hu Zongnan's Third Army in isolated Shijiazhuang is extremely panicked. Many officers' families have been moving to Beiping by plane. The Chiang [Kai-shek] troops attempt to salvage the critical situation in Shijiazhuang by merging local miscellaneous troops, reorganizing the county security teams, "returning home corps," and volunteer "brave citizen" teams stationed in Shijiazhuang into the regular army, and forcing students to enlist. In the city's major streets and alleys, they are digging tunnels, trenches, and building pillboxes everywhere. They are checking household registrations and hotels daily. Recently, under the pretext of "suspected communist bandits," they sealed up eight businesses, including Sanyang Gold Shop, Zhonghua Restaurant, Chaoyang Restaurant, and Hebei Pharmacy. They strictly prohibit "discussing national affairs." Anyone who discusses the bad situation or says "Shijiazhuang cannot be held" will be immediately arrested upon discovery. A few days ago, a worker at the railway factory only said the words "Eighth Route [Army]," and the factory police immediately tried to arrest him on the spot. The city is now in extreme unrest, with citizens in chaos, morale shaken, and food supplies panicked, with prices soaring. Millet has risen from 800 yuan (legal tender) to 3,400 yuan per catty, and white flour from 1,600 yuan to 4,000 yuan per catty. Many poor citizens cannot make a living. Jianguo Middle School has suspended classes due to lack of food, and the students staying at the school are only given a small bowl of rice each day. Except for restaurants, most of the major and small businesses have closed. Banks have completely collapsed. Da Xing Yarn Factory and the steel plant have also recently shut down due to coal shortages. A large number of workers are now unemployed. Merchants, citizens, and workers in the city are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Eighth Route Army to liberate them.

　　石门满城风雨
    商店倒闭物价暴涨
    【本报讯】获鹿消息：自从我军解放正定、栾城，切断石元路和正太路后，处于孤立的石门胡宗南第三军，极度恐慌。很多的军官家眷都用飞机，搬往北平。蒋军妄图挽救石门危局，实行吞并地方杂牌，将驻石门之各县保安队、还乡团、义勇壮丁队，加以整顿后，编入正规军。并强迫学生入伍。市内各大街小巷，到处挖地道，挖壕沟，修筑地堡。天天清查户口，清查旅馆饭店。最近以来，以“奸匪嫌疑”为名，曾查封三阳金店、中华饭庄、朝阳饭店、河北大药房等八个商号。严格禁止“谈论国事”，谁要一谈大局不好，或“石门保不住”等话，发觉即马上捉走。前几天铁路工厂有个工人，只说了“八路”两个字，厂警当场即要捕他。现在市内极度不安，市民混乱，人心大动，粮食恐慌，物价飞涨，小米每斤由八百元（法币）涨到三千四百元，白面由一千六百元涨到四千元一斤。很多贫苦市民，都没法生活。建国中学因无饭吃停课，留校的学生，每天只叫吃一小碗米饭。各大中小商号，除了饭馆以外，已大部停业。银号已完全倒闭。大兴纱厂、炼钢厂因煤炭恐慌，亦于最近停工。现在大批工人已失业。市内商人、市民、工人天天都在渴望着八路军去解放他们。
