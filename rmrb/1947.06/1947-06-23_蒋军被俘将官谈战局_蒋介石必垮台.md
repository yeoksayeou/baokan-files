Chiang Army Captured Generals Talk About the War Situation
	Chiang Kai-shek Will Surely Collapse
[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] Following the great victory at Menglianggu in Mengyin, Shandong, where the elite, fully American-equipped and American-trained 74th Division of the Chiang Army was completely annihilated, the officer training regiment of the Taihang Liberation Army held a current affairs symposium on the 29th of last month. The discussions were widespread and profound. Participants included Major General Li Shou-zheng, Brigade Commander of the 49th Brigade (2nd Rapid Column); Major General Xie Maoquan, Brigade Commander of the 140th Brigade; Major General Liu Guangxin, Brigade Commander of the 119th Brigade; Major General Yang Xianming, Brigade Commander of the 104th Brigade; Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander Li Keyuan; Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander and Political Director of the 127th Brigade, Gao Qiangbin; Major General and Deputy Brigade Commander of the 49th Brigade, Yuan Zhishan; Major General and Commander of the 543rd Regiment of the 181st Brigade, Song Zhonglin; Deng Fu-xuan, Chief of Staff of the 3rd Column; former 19th Army Commander Shi Zebo; Division Commanders Guo Tianxin and Yang Wencai; former Second War Area Artillery Commander Hu Sanyu; and Major General Chief of Staff Ren Deming, among others. All agreed that the victory in Shandong not only changed the Shandong war situation but also had a significant impact on the entire country. As Guo Tianxin, former division commander of the 19th Army, said, "This has struck at the nervous system of the reactionaries, causing confusion in their headquarters." At the same time, they believed that this was the bankruptcy of Chiang Kai-shek's "key point offensive" strategy, and they were deeply impressed by the strong combat effectiveness of our army, as evidenced by the fact that when the 74th Division was surrounded, the Chiang army's reinforcements from various locations could not save it from defeat. Yang Xianming said meaningfully, "American equipment and training are no longer effective; the reinforcements of several divisions were repelled. This is proof that the People's Liberation Army is stronger than the Chiang army." Liu Guangxin emphasized, "The tangible losses are certainly irreparable, but the spiritual losses are even more irreparable. The confidence of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army will be strengthened, and the Chiang Kai-shek army will feel that nothing is reliable." Ren Deming continued, "Not only are the lower-level soldiers affected, but even the senior officers will feel helpless. This proves that no matter what tactics the reactionaries adopt, whether it's a key offensive or an all-out advance, no matter how brilliant the methods, they cannot avoid the fate of destruction, unless they are not on the civil war battlefield." Immediately afterwards, everyone used their own personal experience of fighting and losing to the Liberation Army to illustrate that the troops attacking the liberated areas, whether they were direct descendants or miscellaneous forces, whether they were American-equipped or Japanese-equipped, whether they were fast-moving or slow-moving, always suffered defeats. Xie Maoquan pointed out, "No matter how good the equipment, if there is no fighting will, it is still useless." Ren Deming said seriously, "In the past, we opposed the people, so naturally we did not get the support of the people, but rather the opposition of the people. When fighting the Liberation Army, we were like a big blind donkey, without reliable intelligence, only able to look for the enemy on the map, with nothing to eat and nothing to drink." At this point, he recalled the past situation and said, "In the past, when we fought the Japanese, we could run away if we couldn't win. Today, if we fight the people, we can't run away even if we want to. The militia will catch you back even if you break out of the encirclement. If you oppose the people, it doesn't matter if you have American weapons in your hand; if you are for the people, even if you have bricks and tiles in your hand, you will inevitably have the power to win." Mentioning the issue of being afraid of death and being brave in battle, he said, "Who isn't afraid of death? Everyone is afraid of death. It depends on the situation. It's not worth it to risk your life for Chiang Kai-shek's personal gain; if you fight for the interests of the country and the nation, you will naturally be fearless." Ren Deming said, "The Kuomintang has been in power for more than 30 years and has implemented anti-people policies. Under the corrupt structure, the accumulated malpractices are too deep, and each link and department is too fragile, so it is a paper tiger, with only a superficial appearance." Shi Zebo, commander of the 19th Army, said, "The reactionaries are defeated more and more as they fight, and the more they conscript soldiers and collect grain, the more everyone has no food to eat, which will inevitably accelerate their collapse." Deng Fu-xuan said that he believed Chiang Kai-shek's failure was because he violated the trend. He hoped that the Chiang government would realize this as soon as possible and that Chiang Kai-shek would implement his promises and implement the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference; otherwise, the date of his collapse was not far away. Hu Sanyu, former commander of the Second War Area Artillery, spoke last, but his opinions were insightful, profound, and clearly analyzed the war situation. He asked: Why can't the reactionaries' calculations be so smooth? The reason is very simple and ordinary, because one is patriotic self-defense, and the other is traitorous dictatorship. The People's Liberation Army's patriotic self-defense war is to protect the fields, protect the homes, and defend the territory, so the people actively support it, and the soldiers are brave and willing to die. Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the motherland is opposed not only by everyone in the liberated areas but also by everyone in his controlled areas. Finally, he said: "Chiang Kai-shek will not only fail to eliminate the liberated areas, but he will also be unable to maintain his half of the country and become a small, self-sufficient court, because the people under his rule have reached out to him for food and peace, and his foundation is crumbling."

　　蒋军被俘将官谈战局
    蒋介石必垮台
    【本报特讯】山东蒙阴大捷于孟良崮，歼灭蒋军精锐全部美械美训之七十四师，消息传到太行解放军官教导团后，上月廿九日，将官队全体召开时事座谈会，发言极为普遍而深刻。参加者有四十九旅（第二快速纵队）少将旅长李守正、一四○旅少将旅长谢懋权、一一九旅少将旅长刘广信、一○四旅少将旅长杨显明、少将副旅长李克源、一二七旅少将副旅长兼政治主任高强斌、四十九旅少将副旅长袁峙山、一八一旅五四三团少将团长宋钟林、第三纵队参谋长邓负暄、前十九军军长史泽波、师长郭天辛、杨文彩，前二战区炮兵总司令胡三余、少将参谋长任德明等多人。一致认为山东大捷不但转变了山东战局，且对全国亦有重大影响。正如前十九军师长郭天辛说：“这下打击了反动派的神经系，使其首脑部会发生混乱的。”同时他们认为这是蒋介石“重点战术”的破产，而对我军坚强的战斗力、以致七十四师被围时蒋军各处援军都不能挽救其失败的命运，极为赞叹。杨显明意味深长的说道：“美国装备训练也吃不开了，援军几个师，都被打退，这是人民解放军力量大过蒋军的证明”。刘广信强调地指出：“有形的损失固然无法补救，精神上的损失则更是无法补救的，八路军、新四军的自信心会更坚强，蒋介石军会觉得什么也靠不住的。”任德明接着说：“不仅是下级士兵受影响，就是高级干部一样要感到没办法。由此证明，反动派不管采取重点进攻的战术也好，齐头并进的方针也好，再高妙的办法也免不了覆灭的命运，除非他是不在内战战场上。”紧接着大家以自己与解放军作战失败的切身经验来说明进攻解放区的部队，无论是嫡系的杂牌的，无论是美械的日械的，无论是快速的慢速的，总是吃败仗的。谢懋权指出：“装备再好，如果没有战斗意志，依然是无补于事”。任德明严肃的说：“我们过去反人民，自然得不到人民的拥护，得到的是人民的反对。和解放军作战，我们像一个大瞎驴，没有可靠的情报，只能去地图上找作战的敌人，没吃的，没喝的”。谈至此，他回忆过去的情况说：“过去我们和日本人打仗，打不过可以跑，今天和人民打想跑也跑不了。突出包围圈民兵也要把你抓回来，如果反人民你手里拿美国武器也不顶事，你如果为人民手里拿的是砖头瓦块也必然有力量能胜利。”提到打仗怕死与勇敢的问题，他说：“谁不怕死，人人都怕死，看利害情形说话，为蒋介石私人卖命花不来，为国家民族利益打仗，自然奋不顾身”。任德明说：“国民党执政三十余年，实行反人民政策，在腐败的机构下，积弊太深，各环节各部门太脆弱了，因此他是一个纸老虎虚有其表”。十九军军长史泽波说：“反动派越打越败，越抓丁征粮就越闹得大家没饭吃，一定会加速其崩溃。”邓负暄表示：他认为蒋介石的失败是因为违反了潮流，他希望蒋政府及早觉悟，希望蒋介石实行自己的诺言，实行政协决议，否则他崩溃的日期不远了。前二战区炮兵总司令胡三余发言在最后，但意见精辟；深刻而明确的分析了战争形势之后，他发问道：为什么反动派的算盘不能那样如意呢？这个道理非常简单而且平常，就因为一个是爱国自卫，一个是卖国独裁。人民解放军的爱国自卫战争，就是保田保家保卫国土，所以人民积极支援，战士英勇用命；蒋介石的出卖祖国，不但为解放区人人所反对，且为其统治区人人所反对。最后他说：“蒋介石不但消灭不了解放区，而且再想保持其半壁河山，做个偏安的小朝廷也不可能了，因为他统治下的人民已向他伸出了要饭吃、要和平的手，他的基础已摇摇欲坠。”
