　　Repercussions of Two Leadership Methods
    Lessons Learned from Daliu Village in Improving Relations Between Cadres and the Masses
    Yu Zixiu
    Lessons from Failure
    Guangping's work to improve relations between cadres and the masses began with Daliu Village as its base. When the district cadres first arrived in the village, they thought that the village cadres were too detached from the masses and were afraid that the masses would not forgive them. At the same time, they had too high expectations of the village cadres. At the first meeting of cadres above the group leader level, they mobilized the village cadres to confess their mistakes, but the village cadres all started to boast about their achievements and complain about their grievances. For example, the elder of the farmers' association, Song, said: "In the past, I led the establishment of the farmers' association and offended people by fighting the landlords"; the militia captain Wang Zhicheng said: "Leading the militia to support the fight against the enemy delayed work," and so on. At that time, the leadership criticized them for being insincere and not frank. As a result, they all lowered their heads. The three-hour meeting achieved nothing.
    The next day, the village cadres, led by Ge Qingxiang, united as one, vowing to either work together or resign together. When convening a meeting of members, the village cadres secretly arranged for the masses not to attend or to leave early. After ten days, the work could not be carried out. The leadership became anxious and sent the militia from Du Village to search houses door to door, reluctantly convening a mass meeting. At the meeting, the village cadres' shortcomings, such as unfair distribution of fruits, corruption, waste, and coercion, were announced to the masses as usual, but no mention was made of the village cadres' contributions. From then on, the village cadres became more and more opposed to the district cadres in thought and action. If the district cadres did not look for the village cadres for a day, no one would enter the door of the district cadres' residence. Sometimes they would starve the district cadres.
    On the night of the mass meeting, Ge Qingxiang (sub-district representative) found Song Ruxiu (village cadre) and said: "The higher authorities really don't want us anymore. I just heard Qin Zhanyun (member) say to Li Shuzhang: 'Our village cadres will lose face within three days.'" Song Ruxiu was furious when he heard this: "How can I lose face? Let's just quit!" So they separately colluded with the militia captain, instructor, and other cadres. As soon as they entered the district cadres' door, Song Ruxiu said: "What's the use of this handful of dry grass when the child is dead?!" The militia captain said: "The third child rings the bell, are we all going to lose?!" They started to complain one after another. Their purpose was: if they complained, the district cadres would definitely criticize them, and if they were criticized, they would take the opportunity to rebel. Fortunately, they were not criticized this time. Political Commissar Su explained to them: "Admitting mistakes to the masses is to unite the masses and make the work better. It is not losing face, but the most glorious thing." Although the village cadres did not say anything on the surface, their thoughts were still not clear. Half a month passed, and the work in the village was still not progressing. The masses were depressed, and the cadres were discouraged.
    Not only that, at the first joint meeting of village cadres, the unfair distribution of fruits, waste, and coercive orders by the Daliu Village cadres were criticized; then, the incomplete struggle of the Botou Village cadres, the cadres' protection of landlords, and the struggle against middle peasants were also criticized. As a result, the chairman of Botou Village could not sleep all night and did not eat for a day. Militia captain Liu Shangde and self-defense captain Liu Qiao cried, and the cadres of other villages were also very discouraged. At the second joint meeting of village cadres, more than 50 village cadres requested to resign, such as Cao Fu, the chairman of the farmers' association of Beixiaoliu and Nanxiaoliu, who picked up a grocery stall and went out to work. At that time, if the leadership had allowed free resignation, at least 70% of the people would not have continued. At the same time, the militias of 13 villages were disbanded, the women's associations of 6 villages collapsed, the farmers' associations were depressed, and the work in the Daliu sub-district was stagnant.
  Successful Experience
    After research, it was necessary to change the style of work and continue to deepen the work with the new spirit of establishing merit and commending models. This spirit also started from Daliu Village. Similarly, the farmers' association group meeting was first convened, and the village cadres were actively encouraged to establish merit in the current work (land distribution) to achieve the goal of correctly solving the relationship between cadres and the masses. At the village cadre meeting, the leadership first made a self-criticism: "In the past, we ignored everyone's contributions, which was wrong." Then, they commended the different contributions of the village cadres in their previous work. Village cadre Song Ruxiu said: "We can't say that we have no mistakes, and there are many, such as the distribution of fruits. I took more than 19,000 yuan worth of things, but the higher authorities should not abandon us and not let us speak." With this, their thoughts were cleared, and their emotions immediately stabilized.
    The leadership helped the village cadres convene a mass meeting, and commended the village cadres' contributions in a very concrete way. The village cadres also consciously admitted some mistakes to the masses, and exposed the landlords' conspiracy to attack the village cadres by taking advantage of the opportunity to inspect the village cadres. From then on, the enthusiasm of the Daliu Village cadres rebounded. Song Lianyi, the chairman of the farmers' association, was already an old man in his sixties. During the land distribution, he got up before dawn to strike the bell and drum to convene cadres to hold meetings, and he always stayed up until midnight for work for a month. Village chief Qin Shuchun, sub-district representative Song Ruxiu, and captain Wang Zhicheng were also so busy that they sometimes could not eat. Under the active work of the village cadres, the 16 group leaders, 16 reviewers, and 16 group representatives also became active, the militia was restored, and the women's association was reorganized. Under the call to strive to be model cadres, all the cadres of the village vowed to strive to be models, and even 9 of the 16 group leaders were determined to strive to be models. The masses all said: "It is not easy to be a village cadre, they are busy for our neighborhood all day and night. It is not a loss to let the village cadres spend more." Now the village has jumped from a backward village to become one of the three "locomotive villages" in the eastern sub-district.
    Starting from the commendation of the Daliu Village cadres, the dead and silent situation of the 13 villages in the Daliu sub-district has greatly changed. The commendation of the Daliu Village cadres at the joint meeting of village cadres was unexpected by other villages. They all knew that the Daliu Village cadres would definitely lose face and step down, and then it would be unclear whose village would be next. Therefore, the general mood of the village cadres was equally low, waiting to step down. However, after Daliu Village was commended, their thinking changed. For example, the Botou Village cadres said on the way back: "As long as we work hard, the higher authorities will forgive us for our mistakes." On the same day, after returning to the village, they held a meeting of group leaders and cadres and said: "Don't be angry, the higher authorities are still praising the Daliu Village cadres. Fighting cadres is a rumor, let's work actively too!" The same was true for other villages such as Silanggu, Beixiaoliu, and Nanxiaoliu. Cao Fu, the chairman of the farmers' association of Beixiaoliu, who had already left without saying goodbye, also became active again. A few days later, another joint meeting of sub-district village cadres was held, and each village had achieved more or less results. At that time, the leadership made a comprehensive commendation. In the commendation, they especially commended the three villages of Du Village, Daliu, and Beizhanggu, and pointed out that the cadres of Silanggu and Jiazhuang were not all present, and their work achievements were not great. They should strive to catch up, and pointed out specific methods. The cadres of Silanggu, Jiaqinzhuang, and Tianzhuang were also happy with this method of commending achievements and specifically criticizing shortcomings, and they also had methods when they returned. At the most recent joint meeting of village cadres, the work achievements were even greater than the last time.

　　两种领导方法的反响
    大留村改善干群关系的经验教训
    宇自修
    失败的教训
    广平改善干群关系的工作先以大留村为基点开始的。区干初到该村时，思想上只认为村干脱离群众过甚，恐群众不会原谅他们，同时对村干的要求也过高。第一次组长以上的干部会议上就动员村干坦白错误，但村干们却个个表起功诉起冤来，如农会长老宋说：“过去我领导成立了农会，斗了地主得罪了人”；民兵队长王致成说：“领导民兵出发支助打敌人耽误了活”等等。当时领导上批评他们不虚心、不坦白。这样一来弄的他们一个个低了头。开了三个钟头的会，结果会议毫无成就。
    第二天村干们以葛清祥为主结合成一股气，大家宣誓要干都干，要不干都下台。召开会员大会时村干暗中布置群众不参加会议，或者零走。这样十天的光景，工作也没法作了，领导上急了，把杜村民兵调来挨门搜人，勉强的开了一次群众会，在会上照例的把村干分果实不公贪污浪费强迫等缺点向群众宣布了，但村干们的功劳半点没谈。从此会后，村干们思想上行动上对区干更加对立，区干一天不找村干，一天没人进区干住的门。有时就把区干饿起来。
    当开群众会的那天晚上，葛清祥（小区代表）找到宋如秀（村干）说：“上级是真不要我们了，刚才听秦占云（会员）对李树章说：三天内咱村干就得丢人。”宋如秀一听火了：“我怎合着丢人，干脆算了吧！”于是分头串连了民兵队长、指导员等干部，一进区干门，宋如秀说：“孩子死了要这把干草干啥？！”民兵队长说：“老三碰钟，合着输吧？！”你一言我一语的大发起牢骚。他们的目的是：发了牢骚区干一定批评，一批评就趁机蹦。幸而这次却未批评他们，苏政委向他们解释说：“向群众承认错误是有了团结群众，使工作搞好并不是丢人，而是最光荣的。”村干虽然表面没说啥，但大家思想仍是不通。半个月过去了，该村工作仍无进展，群众消沉，干部泄气。
    不仅如此，在第一次村干联席会上，还把大留村干如何分果实不公、浪费、强迫命令等作了批评；接着又把箔头村干如何斗争不彻底，干部掩护地主，斗中农等等同样作了批评。这样一来，使的箔头村会长回去一夜没睡觉，一天没吃饭，民兵队长刘尚得、自卫队长刘乔哭了一场，其他村村干也都很丧气。第二次村干联席会上汇报工作时，要求辞职村干达五十余人，如北小留、南小留农会长曹福等，挑起杂货担子出外不干工作了，当时的情况如果领导上可以允许自由辞职的话，最低限度要有百分之七十以上的人不干。同时十三个村民兵解散了，六个村妇会跨了台，农会消沉，大留小区的工作停滞起来。
  成功的经验
    经研究必须转变作风，决定以立功表模的新精神继续深入工作。这一精神也是先从大留村开始的，同样先召开了农会小组会，从反干部诱导到从当前工作（分地）中使村干积极立功，达到正确解决干群关系的目的。在村干会议上，领导上先作了检讨：“以往把大家功劳忽视了，这是不对的”。接着表扬了各村干以往工作上不同的大小功劳，村干宋如秀说：“我们不能说没有错误，并且还很多，如分果实，我就要了一万九千多元的东西，但是上级不该不要我们，压着头横竖不让我们说话。”这样一作，思想都打通了，情绪立时稳下来。
    领导上帮助村干召开了群众大会，把村干的功劳很具体的表了一回，村干们也自觉的向群众承认了一些错误，同时揭发了地主乘检查村干的机会打击村干的阴谋，从此大留村村干情绪复趋高涨，农会长宋连义已经是六十多岁的老人了，在分地时，天不明就起来撞钟敲鼓召集干部开会，夜里为工作一个月的工夫老是到半夜睡，村长秦树春、小区代表宋如秀、队长王致成，同样忙的有时就顾不上吃饭。在村干这种积极工作下十六个组长、十六个评议员、十六个小组代表，也都积极起来，民兵也恢复了，妇会又组织起来。在争取模范干部号召下，该村干部全体宣誓要争取模范，连十六个组长内也有九名决心争取模范的，群众均说：“当村干真不容易，整天整夜为咱街忙，叫村干多花点也不亏”。现该村由落后村一跃而成为东小区三火车头村之一。
    从表扬大留村村干那时起使大留小区十三个村死沉的局面大为改观。村干联席会上表扬了大留村村干，使其他各村出乎意料之外，他们都知道大留村干一定要丢人下台，以后说不清轮到谁村头上。因此一般村村干情绪是一样低落等待下台，可是大留村受表扬后，使他们思想上起了变化，如箔头村干回去在路上说：“犯了错只要好好工作上级就原谅”。当天回村后就开了组长干部会说：“大家别生气了，大留村村干上级还夸奖呢？斗干部是造谣，咱们也积极工作吧”！其他如四郎固，南北小留也是这样干起工作来，北小留已经不辞而别的农会长曹福也重新积极起来。接着没几天又召开了一次小区村干联席会，各村或多或少都有了成绩，当时领导上又作了全面性的表扬，在表扬中特别表扬了杜村、大留、北张固三村，同时指出四郎固、贾庄等村干来的不齐，工作成绩还不大，应当努力赶上，并指出具体办法。这种表扬成绩具体批评缺点的方式，四郎固、贾秦庄、田庄的村干也高兴，回去也有了办法。在最近一次的村干联席会上比上次的工作成绩更大。
