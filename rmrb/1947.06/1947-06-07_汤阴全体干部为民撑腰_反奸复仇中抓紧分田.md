　　Tangyin Entire Cadre Supports the People; Seizing Land Distribution While Fighting Traitors and Seeking Revenge
    [Our Newspaper] Under the all-out effort of Tangyin's entire cadre, land reform teams, and thousands of activists to benefit the people, a fierce "one-pot cooking" movement has been launched in 116 villages. The first key to launching the movement is that, inspired by the achievements of cadres in serving the people, they overcame their right-leaning fear of enemy traitors and boldly and bravely went deep into the countryside to support the people and make decisions for them. The leadership further encouraged the spirit of struggle from a positive perspective and recognized two model comrades from Linxian Normal School (they mobilized the masses in Daqingshan Village, where others dared not go), and everyone said: "Let's do it, if they dare, why shouldn't we?" Secondly, the land reform movement started with complaining about suffering, fighting traitors, and seeking revenge, and the issue of land was resolved in the general liquidation. "Land is connected to the hearts of the masses." This grasp truly captured the hearts of the masses, and the "one-pot cooking" policy accelerated the completion of the land reform process. Shi Bingnan, a major local tyrant and landlord in Ludong Village, occupied fifteen *qing* of wheat fields. Currently, the wheat ears are ripe, and the masses immediately put forward the slogan: "Take back the wheat fields and eat white flour." Through the joint complaint and struggle of six villages, it was completely recovered and distributed fairly and reasonably in a timely manner. The masses said: "The wheat is yellow, the Eighth Route Army has arrived; take back the land and eat noodles!" The method of harvesting wheat and reclaiming land by the masses is called "one-pot serving," and every village is willing to "one-pot serving." A treacherous and domineering landlord in Daxing Village occupied 800 *mu* of peasants' land, and Su Boyin, a treacherous and domineering landlord in Chengguan, occupied 1,100 *mu*. This time, all of them were recovered by the peasants. These three villages alone recovered 3,400 *mu* of land. When the farmers' association in Nangu Village held a meeting, a landlord went to threaten them with a gun, and the masses immediately executed him on the spot: "Today is my world, I'm not afraid of you!" When recovering land, houses, and property from habitual bandit Si Huazai, everyone said: "Thousands of families are poor, but the Si family is rich. Take it, this is all our blood and sweat."

　　汤阴全体干部为民撑腰
    反奸复仇中抓紧分田
    【本报讯】汤阴全体干部、翻身队及数千积极分子，在为民翻身立功的全力突击下，已在一百一十六个村中猛烈开展了“一锅煮”运动。首先干部在为民立功的鼓舞下，克服了对敌奸右倾恐惧的情绪，大胆而勇敢的深入农村，给群众撑腰作主，是开展运动的主要关键之一。领导上更从积极的方面鼓舞了斗争勇气，给林县师范两位模范同志记了功（他俩在别人不敢去的大青山村，发动了群众），大家都说：“干吧，人家敢咱就不敢？”其次翻身运动从诉苦反奸复仇入手，总清算中就抓住解决了土地问题，“土地连着群众心”，这一抓真是准准的抓住群众心眼了，这个“一锅煮”的方针，加速了完成土地改革的进程。路东×村大恶霸地主石丙南，霸占有十五顷麦地，目前麦穗成熟，群众即提出：“收回麦地吃白面”的口号，在六村联合诉苦斗争下，完全收回，并及时公平合理的分配了。群众说：“麦子黄呀八路军到，收回地呀吃面条！”群众叫割麦又收地的办法，叫“连锅端”，村村愿意“连锅端”。大性村奸霸地主霸有农民八百亩土地，城关奸霸苏伯寅霸着一千一百亩，此次均为农民收回。仅这三村即收回地三千四百亩。南固村农会开会时，一个地主带着枪去威胁，群众当即将其就地枪决：“今天是老子的天下，怕你个屁。”在向惯匪司华在收回土地、房子、财物时，都说：“穷了千万家，富了司一家，拿吧，这都是咱们的血汗。”
