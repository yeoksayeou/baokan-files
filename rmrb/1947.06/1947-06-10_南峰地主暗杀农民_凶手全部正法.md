[This report from our correspondent in the 冀鲁豫 (Ji-Lu-Yu) region dated the 8th.] In Lizhuang, Fourth District of Nanfeng, a shocking case of a local tyrant landlord assassinating a peasant leader has been uncovered, and the perpetrators have been executed. Landlords Li Hongkui, Li Lianfa, Li Jizeng, Li Jimei, and others manipulated various village organizations to undermine the efforts of the masses to achieve liberation. During the land reform movement, Li Jidong (the village's Farmers' Association Organizing Committee member) actively led the masses in settling accounts with the landlords, making him a thorn in the landlords' side. The landlords frequently spread rumors and fabricated excuses, attempting to incite the masses' dissatisfaction with Li Jidong in order to attack him, squeeze him out, and bring the Farmers' Association completely under their control. Recently, when the county proposed a major review and the district convened training classes for activists, the landlords sent their confidant Li Lianfa to attend the training. In the training class, the district emphasized resolutely suppressing landlords and bad elements who were hated by the masses. After Li Lianfa returned, he immediately colluded with several other landlords. That night, they lured Li Jidong to the Xidi vegetable garden and strangled him to death. After investigation, the village landlords were arrested. After interrogation, the landlords could not hide the truth and confessed that Li Jimei and five others were the masterminds behind the murder of Li Jidong. According to their confessions, they also planned to kill Li Jidong's nephew, Li Hongting, to eliminate any future trouble. The masses in the village, who had been bitterly oppressed by the Li gang for a long time, were filled with hatred and unanimously demanded that they pay with their lives. Our democratic government granted the masses' request and immediately executed the six criminals, including Li Jidong, by firing squad at a mass meeting.

　　南峰地主暗杀农民
    凶手全部正法
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】南峰四区栗庄发现恶霸地主对翻身领袖的惊人暗杀案，凶犯已经处决。该村地主栗鸿奎、栗连法、栗继曾、栗继美等操纵村中各种组织，破坏群众翻身。土地改革运动中，栗继东（该村农会组织委员）积极领导群众向地主进行清算斗争，因此组成了地主的眼中钉，地主们时常造谣，制造口实，企图引起群众对栗继东的不满，来打击他，以便把他挤掉，使农会完全受地主的操纵。最近该县提出大复查，区里召开了积极分子训练班，地主就派其亲信栗连法去受训，在训练班中，区里提出为群众撑腰，为群众痛恨的地主坏蛋要坚决镇压后，栗连法回来马上和几个地主一齐商量好，当晚就把栗继东诱到西地菜园勒死。经调查明白，随将该村地主逮捕，经过审讯，地主无法隐瞒，供出勒死栗继东主谋地主栗继美等共六人，据供还准备把栗继东之侄子栗鸿亭治死，以免后患。该庄群众在栗为霸长期压迫之下，已恨之入骨，一致要求赔命。我民主政府答应群众要求，即将栗继东等六犯在群众会上执行枪决。
