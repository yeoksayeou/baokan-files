　　Feeding Mules to Farm Well
    Ambush Exposed
    Renzhuang, Licheng, Cuts Off Tails Again
    [Report from Licheng by our newspaper] During the planting gap in Renzhuang Village, Second District, the feudal vestiges are being thoroughly eliminated. After the land reform last winter, because the landlords were cunning and ambushed the fruits [of land reform], the vestiges could not be completely eliminated at once. During the drought resistance and planting, the masses discussed the contrast between the landlords' and their own lives. Everyone believed that in terms of land and daily life, the landlords were much better off than the newly emancipated peasants. The land was even distributed to an average of three mu per person, and it was even better than our three mu. Some individual landlords even fed mules, and even if they were allocated to relatively distant land, they didn't want to farm it, and they still ate white flour, while we are worried about not having enough rice to eat. Therefore, the slogan was put forward: "Autumn land must be fully planted, and feudal vestiges must be completely eliminated." While planting, they were brewing this idea. Today, whose tail is being cut off? Finally, a consensus was reached that it was necessary to cut off the feudal vestiges and absolutely not touch the property of peasants who started from labor. After mature discussion, from June 2nd to 6th, in the middle of these five days, they worked from early morning until late at night to complete the work of cutting off the tails of six households. Two mules, one donkey, three carts, thirteen sheep, eighteen mu of land, seven hundred and twenty jin of salt, four hundred and twenty jin of cotton, fifty-four shi of coarse and fine grains, clothes and farm tools worth about over one million [currency unit not specified], and one hundred and fifty-three silver dollars were obtained and distributed to the peasants one by one.

　　喂骡子种好地
    打埋伏被揭露
    黎城仁庄再割尾巴
    【本报黎城讯】二区仁庄村下种空隙，割净封建尾巴。在去冬土地改革后，因地主狡猾埋伏果实，不能一时割净尾巴，群众在抗旱下种中讨论地主和自己的生活对比，大家认为土地和日常生活上，地主均比咱们新翻身农民强的多，土地还每人平均到三亩，比咱们的三亩还好，有个别的地主还喂着骡子，给他分到较远的地，他还不想去种，还吃的是白面，咱们吃米还怕不够吃。所以提出口号：秋地要下完种，封建尾巴要割净，一面下种，一面酝酿着。今天割尾巴是割谁的，最后普遍认识一致，是要割封建的尾巴，绝对不割劳动起家农民的财产，讨论成熟，于是在六月二号至六号五天中间，起早搭黑完成了六户割尾巴工作。得到骡子二头，驴一头，大车三辆，羊十三只，土地十八亩，盐七百二十斤，棉花四百廿斤，粗细粮五十四石，衣服农具等价约百余万，银洋一百五十三元，均一一分到农民手里。  （顺庆、书令、光北）
