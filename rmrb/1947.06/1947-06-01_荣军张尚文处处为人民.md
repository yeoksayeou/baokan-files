[Report from this newspaper in Zuoquan] Disabled veteran Zhang Shangwen is closely united with the local masses and is greatly loved by the people. He is forty years old this year and was demobilized in 1942, settling down in the village. He has consistently performed well. During the land reform movement last winter, he worked tirelessly day and night, leading the masses to thoroughly eliminate feudalism. He was responsible for the safekeeping of the fruits of the struggle, and he was truly selfless, believing that every needle and thread was the people's blood and sweat and he did not take a single bit, which moved the village cadres. Therefore, no bad phenomena occurred during the fruit distribution. The masses elected him as a hero of liberation and supported him as the vice chairman of the farmers' association, and also made him the director of the cooperative, leading the village in large-scale production. He is particularly concerned about textiles, and mobilized Deputy Village Head Comrade Liu Jisuo to work together to promote the determination to do a good job in textiles. They first paid attention to overcoming the idea of ​​disrespecting textiles that existed among men, and then organized women, paying attention to regular inspection and selection of models. As a result, during the hundred-day textile movement, a total of 225 jin of yarn and 77 "da chi" (big chi, a unit of Chinese length) of cloth were spun, and eight textile models such as Huangfu Cun'e emerged. The masses all said: "Old Zhang is really doing meritorious service for the people, adding merit upon merit." Now another hundred-day textile plan has been formulated to strive to exceed the original plan, and guarantee that they will not need to buy cloth to wear cotton clothes in winter.
