　　Current Situation in Europe
    At present, among the twenty-four countries in Europe, besides the Soviet Union, the other twenty-three countries can be roughly divided into four categories: The first category consists of countries where democratic forces are dominant, with the Communist Party and other parties in a coalition government, implementing land reform and nationalization of large industries, and some even further implementing planned economies. These countries are called "New Democratic Countries." There are eight countries in this category: Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany; the second category consists of countries where the Communist Party participates in the government, but the remnants of fascism have not yet been eliminated, and land reform and industrial nationalization have not been implemented. The reactionaries in these countries are doing everything possible to collude with American and British imperialism to oppose the Communist Party and their own people, but as the people's forces grow, the reactionaries are gradually disintegrating and collapsing. There are three such countries: France, Italy, and Austria; the third category consists of countries where the Communist Party has begun to participate in the government, indicating the rise of democratic forces. There are four countries: Belgium, Norway, Iceland, and Finland.

    The above fifteen countries, plus the socialist Soviet Union, cover a total area of eight million square kilometers, with a total population of over 325 million. That is to say, 70 percent of the land and 68 percent of the population of Europe are already under the leadership of the Communist Party and democratic forces.

    The fourth category still consists of countries where reactionary bourgeois and traitors are dominant, implementing imperialist policies and traitorous policies. There are eight countries: the United Kingdom (the British Communist Party also has two members in Parliament), Portugal, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and Denmark. In Denmark, the Netherlands, and other countries, there are also Communist Party members participating in central and local governments. Although their power is not great, the underground struggle led by the Spanish Communist Party is growing stronger and has already joined the government-in-exile. The People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Greek Communist Party is fighting against the traitorous and reactionary government. The British people are increasingly leaning to the left, and the right-wing Attlee government of the Labour Party has aroused opposition from the broad masses of the people, even within the Labour Party.

    The progress and awakening of the world's people have promoted the arrival of a worldwide democratic upsurge. No reactionary force can resist it, and the growth and strengthening of democratic Europe is an example.

　　欧洲现势
    眼下，欧洲二十四个国家中，除了苏联以外，其他二十三个国家大约可分为四类：第一类是民主势力占优势由共产党及其他党派联合执政的国家，实行了土地改革和大工业国有化，有些并进一步实行了计划经济，这些国家就叫做“新民主主义国家”。共有八国：南斯拉夫、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、波兰、捷克、匈牙利、德国苏占领区；第二类是共产党参政，法西斯残余还没有肃清，尚未实行土地改革及工业国有化，这些国家的反动派正在竭尽一切力量勾结美英帝国主义反对共产党及本国人民，但在人民势力壮大的情形下，反动派逐渐分化崩溃。这样的国家，共有三国：法国、意大利和奥地利；第三类是共产党已开始参加了政府，表示了民主势力的抬头，共有四个国家：比利时、挪威、冰岛、芬兰。
    上述十五国加上社会主义的苏联，总面积达八百万方公里，总人口达三万万二千五百多万。就是说全欧洲百分之七十的土地和百分之六十八的人口已经在共产党和民主势力的领导下了。
    第四类仍是反动的资产阶级和卖国贼占优势，施行帝国主义政策和卖国政策的国家，共有八国：英国（英共在议会中也有两位议员）、葡萄牙、西班牙、希腊、荷兰、瑞典、瑞士和丹麦。在丹、荷等国也有共产党员参加中央和地方政府，虽力量不大，但西班牙共产党所领导的地下斗争却日渐强大且已参加了流亡共和政府。希共领导下的人民解放军正与卖国反动政府作战。英国人民日益左倾，工党右派艾德里政府已引起广大人民、甚至工党内部的反对。
    世界人民的进步和觉醒，推动了全世界民主高潮的到来，任何反动势力是抗拒不了的，民主欧洲的成长和壮大，便是一个例证。
