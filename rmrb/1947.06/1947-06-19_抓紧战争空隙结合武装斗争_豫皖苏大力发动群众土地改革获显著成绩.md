　　Seizing War Gaps, Combining Armed Struggle
    Significant Achievements in Mass Mobilization for Land Reform in the Yu-Wan-Su Border Region

    [Our Yu-Wan-Su Dispatch] From February to the present, the land reform movement in the Yu-Wan-Su Border Region has achieved significant results despite the tense situation of continuous "sweeps" and repeated "encirclement and suppression" by Chiang's troops. The movement has achieved point-by-point breakthroughs in most areas, and a surge of enthusiasm has been created in some areas.

    Different specific guidelines were adopted in different regions. For example, in old guerrilla base areas such as Sui County, Qi County, Tai Kang, and Tong Xu, where mass conditions were better, the policy of thoroughly reforming at once was adopted, striving to avoid re-division after the initial distribution. In new areas such as Luyi, Bo County, Tai Kang, and Sui County, the focus was first on combating traitors, corruption, and local tyrants, allowing peasants to obtain some land and movable property, while generally leaving small landlords untouched. In the Yellow River flood area, such as Tong Xu, Fugou, Xihua, and Huaiyang counties, much of the land was submerged after the floods, residents suffered excessive losses, and returning masses who had been displaced urgently demanded the restoration of production. Therefore, the authorities firmly supported the masses' demands, adopting the policy of abolishing landlords' land ownership and implementing land distribution based on population, allocating five to ten mu per person, with slightly more for those with greater labor power, and appropriately caring for widows, widowers, and orphans, to thoroughly realize the goal of "land to the tiller." In old areas that had undergone land reform, such as Shangqiu, Xiayi, and Yongcheng counties, the land obtained by peasants was taken back by landlords when our army withdrew last year. After our army liberated these areas again this time, a policy of redressing grievances and seeking revenge, recovering all land, was adopted. Landlords who had not retaliated against the masses were rewarded.

    According to incomplete statistics, in the past four months, 335 villages in old areas such as Sui County, Qi County, and Tai Kang in the Yu-Wan-Su Border Region have undergone thorough land reform, with peasants recovering 48,569 mu of land and 19,700 peasants obtaining land. In the Yellow River flood areas of Fugou and Tong Xu, 13,000 peasants have also initially received 80,000 mu of land. In newly liberated areas of Wo Yang and Bo County, according to the limited information available, peasants have also obtained more than 5,000 mu of land. Other areas are also progressing enthusiastically.

    Four months of experience have proven that because peasants eagerly demand land, regardless of the volatility of the environment, whether in new or old areas, central or marginal areas, and regardless of the threats and persecution of peasants by the reactionaries, as long as we can bravely lead the masses in armed struggle, and as long as we can boldly and freely organize peasants to recover land, a surge of enthusiasm can be quickly ignited. Even under the repeated "sweeps" and threats of the enemy, peasants can still hold mass rallies with more than 10,000 people to settle accounts and reason, and persist in land reform.

    Experience has also proven that land reform in guerrilla areas must be combined with war, making full use of all war gaps for land reform. Due to the enemy's lack of troops, war gaps are inevitably significant. Areas that have seized these gaps for land reform have all achieved remarkable results. Areas that wait for the end of the war before carrying out land reform will inevitably accomplish nothing. Land reform in guerrilla areas is generally carried out in the form of armed work teams, mobilizing a large number of armed peasant activists to monitor Chiang's military strongholds and cover the masses in land distribution. When the enemy sweeps through, the militia will cover the masses, holding guns in one hand and abacuses and land registers in the other, fighting guerrillas. Many peasants even lead the landlords' cattle, monitor the landlords, and fight guerrillas together, fearing that the enemy will seize them and they will not be able to get their share. With such enthusiasm for land distribution among the masses, the enemy's sweeping offensives can never be stopped.

    In carrying out land reform, experience has also proven that it is necessary to openly and directly promote and call on peasants to implement "land to the tiller" (the notion that guerrilla areas can only propose rent and interest reduction cannot meet the demands of the masses), to enlighten the masses to dig up the roots of poverty, recognize the justness of peasants recovering land, and call on peasants to bravely recover land from the landlords. Joint struggles involving several or dozens of villages are adopted against local tyrants and prominent large landlords, and land is distributed without meticulously accounting for every detail. After the peasants' enthusiasm is aroused, they go to the landlords' homes in teams to settle accounts and demand land and red deeds everywhere. For the most heinous criminals, the peasants rush into their homes, confiscate grain and livestock, and distribute them. Peasants tie up a few disobedient landlords and send them to the democratic government. For a small number of military dependents, martyrs' families, and enlightened landlords who support land reform, the combination of voluntary land donations and struggle is adopted. The surging land reform movement in the Yu-Wan-Su Border Region has thus been launched.

　　抓紧战争空隙结合武装斗争
    豫皖苏大力发动群众土地改革获显著成绩
    【本报豫皖苏讯】从二月到现在，豫皖苏土地改革运动，在蒋军连续“扫荡”与反复“清剿”的紧张情况下，已获显著成绩，大部地区已据点式的突破，部分地区已造成热潮。
    在各种不同地区，采用了各种不同的具体方针。如在睢县、杞县、太康、通许等老游击根据地，群众条件较好，便采取一下子改革彻底的方针，力求作到分后不再重分。在鹿邑、亳县、太康、睢县等新区，则先以反奸反贪污反恶霸为主，使农民取得一部分土地和动产，对一般小地主不动。对黄泛区如通许、扶沟、西华、淮阳等县，经黄泛后，土地多被淹没，居民损失过大，流离他乡归来的群众迫切要求恢复生产，因此就坚决拥护群众此种要求，采取取消地主土地所有权的方针，实行计口授田，每人授田五亩至十亩，劳动力多的稍多分一些，鳏寡孤独，适当予以照顾，达到彻底实现耕者有其田。经过土地改革的老区如商邱、夏邑、永城等县，去年我军退出时，农民所得土地又曾为地主倒回，此次我军重新解放后，即采取伸冤复仇，收回一切土地的方针。未向群众倒算的地主，则受到奖励。
    据不完全的统计，四个月来，豫皖苏睢县、杞县、太康等老区，已有三百三十五个村庄进行了彻底的土地改革，农民收回土地四万八千五百六十九亩，得地农民一万九千七百人。扶沟、通许黄泛区，一万三千农民也初步分得土地八万亩。涡阳、亳县刚解放地区，据仅知材料，农民亦获得土地五千余亩，其他地区亦在热烈的进行。
    四个月经验证明：由于农民热烈要求着土地，因此不管环境如何动荡，不管新老地区，不管中心区与边沿区，不管反动派对农民如何威胁迫害，只要我们能够英勇的领导群众进行武装斗争，只要我们能够大胆放手的组织农民收回土地，热潮便可迅速发动起来。虽在敌人反复“扫荡”威胁下，农民仍能开万人以上的清算说理大会，坚持土地改革。
    经验又证明：游击区土地改革，必须与战争相结合，尽量利用一切战争空隙进行土地改革。由于敌人兵力的不足，战争空隙必然是很大的。凡是抓紧这一空隙进行土改的地区，均获显著成绩。凡是等待战争结束后再行土地改革的地区，必至一事无成。游击区土地改革，一般以武工队形式进行工作，大量武装农民积极分子，监视蒋军据点，掩护群众分田。敌人扫荡时，民兵即掩护群众一手拿枪，一手拿算盘、地亩册子，打游击。许多农民，甚至牵着地主的牛，监视着地主，一同打游击，惟恐敌人抢走后分不到手。群众有这样的分地热情，敌人的扫荡进攻是永远不能阻止的。
    在进行土地改革中，经验又证明：必须公开直接的向农民宣传号召实行耕者有其田，（那种以为游击区只能提减租减息的认识，是不能满足群众要求的。）启发群众挖穷根，认识农民收回土地的正义性，号召农民勇敢的从地主手中收回土地。对恶霸及突出的大地主则采取几个村或几十个村的联合斗争，不算细账就分配土地。农民热情鼓起来后，便到处结队去地主家算账要土地要红契。对罪大恶极的，农民就冲进他家里，把粮食牲口一齐没收来分配了。少数违抗的地主，农民就把他捆起来，送到民主政府去。对少数军属、烈属，及赞助土地改革之开明地主，则自动献田与斗争结合来进行。汹涌澎湃的豫皖苏土地改革运动，就这样开展起来了。
