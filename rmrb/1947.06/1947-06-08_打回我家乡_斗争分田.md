　　"Fight back to my hometown... Struggle to divide the land..."
　　Zhang Bo
　　"Where's the second platoon leader?" Comrade Zhu Rumao, his face covered in blood, lay on the grass, his weak voice calling for his platoon leader.
　　The second platoon leader rushed to his side in three steps.
　　"Second... Platoon Leader! I'm not going to make it. I've been here for four or five months... I haven't contributed much to the revolution." He said intermittently.
　　The second platoon leader bandaged the walnut-sized bullet hole on his left forehead while holding the water bottle to his mouth.
　　"Zhu Rumao, it's nothing! Have a drink of water! You can still serve the people in the future; you can still contribute to the revolution! Don't worry! Don't think wildly, the stretcher will be here soon."
　　"Second Platoon Leader... Ever since Bozhou was liberated and I went north across the Yellow River, I have been very moved. I used to hear you say that the liberated areas implemented 'land to the tiller' and everyone has food; I didn't believe it. Later, when we were in Chaocheng for reorganization, I saw the struggle sessions with my own eyes, the people dividing land and things..."
　　Speaking of this, Zhu Rumao became excited, and his spirit seemed particularly radiant, as if he intended to raise his head, but finally it drooped down again.
　　I often thought: "One day I will also go back to Guangdong to struggle, to struggle against the landlords and local bullies in my village, damn them! Divide a few acres of land, I wish I could finish three days of work in one day; I look forward to the day we fight to my home, now I can't do it anymore, I can't make revolution anymore, I hope the revolution will never forget me!"
　　Zhu Rumao said excitedly in one breath, looking eagerly at the second platoon leader, as if waiting for the platoon leader's answer.
　　"Old Zhu! Don't worry! One day we will fight to your hometown! Struggle, divide the land."
　　The bright red blood had already soaked through the bandage; Zhu Rumao's lips were still moving, but it was no longer possible to hear what he was saying. Under the pale moonlight, Zhu Rumao's smiling face could be vaguely seen.
　　Zhu Rumao was liberated from Bozhou in January this year. As he himself said, after crossing the Yellow River and heading north, he changed and became extraordinarily active. He rushed to do everything. No matter how many days the army marched, a machine gun was always placed on his shoulder, and he refused to let others replace him. When fighting the outskirts of Jixian and Tangyin, during earthwork operations, he was always the first to pick up the hoe and the last to put it down.
　　In the class's speak bitterness meetings, he spoke to everyone with his impassioned and angry, thick Guangdong accent. The first sentence was: "Damn it! My family of eight only has three acres of land; the grain from three acres is not enough to pay the rent and the damn taxes; my family owes the landlord money, year after year, more and more. In the 28th year of the Republic of China, when I was seventeen, the landlord didn't agree and fined my family of eight to work for him all summer - building a house; the money owed in the 32nd year was even more, and the landlord insisted that the Bao chief drag my brother to sell him as a conscripted soldier, to pay off part of the money. I knew that in a few years it would be my turn to sell myself as a conscript to pay off debts. Unexpectedly, my situation after coming out was not as good as my brother's. In the 33rd year, my master - the landlord became the Bao chief and arrested me to be a soldier, saying it was interest...."
　　In this battle of Tangyin, the outer trench was only a dozen meters away from the enemy. In order to effectively cover everyone's breakthrough of the front line, he bravely dragged the machine gun to the edge of the outer trench to fire. The machine gun was fired red-hot, and he wiped out a large counterattack of 140 to 150 enemies. He was wounded in the left arm and neck twice in a row. When the company commander came up to replace him, he said: "How can I go down! In the past, when I was a KMT soldier, I was sorry for the revolution. I worked for Chiang Kai-shek, the landlord who drank my blood, I regret it so much! Now I have to fight as hard as three people!"
　　The third time, the bullet finally unfortunately pierced his head, a hole the size of a walnut, and he fell. Yes! The revolution will never forget Zhu Rumao, and one day we will fight to Guangdong to fulfill Zhu Rumao's wish to struggle and divide the land.

　　“打回我家乡……斗争分田……”
    张勃
    “二排长呢？”满脸血迹的朱如茂同志，躺在草地上，微弱的声音在叫唤着他的排长。
    二排长三步并两步的连忙跑到他的跟前。
    “二………排长！我不行了，我来了四、五个月……替革命供献不大”。他断断续续的说。
    二排长一面给他缠着左额上核桃大的弹孔，一面把水壶送到他的嘴边。
    “朱如茂，那没啥！喝口水吧！将来还可以替老百姓服务；还可以为革命出力呢？忙啥！不要乱想，担架马上就来了”。
    “二排长………我自从在亳州解放后，北上一过了黄河，我心里就很感动，我从前听你说解放区实行耕者有其田，人人有饭吃；我还不相信，后来咱们在朝城整训，我亲眼看见斗争会，老百姓分田分东西………”。
    说到这里朱如茂兴奋起来了，精神也显的特别焕发，似乎打算把头抬起来，但是终于又垂了下去。
    我时常想：“总有一天我也回广东去斗争，去斗争我村里老财恶霸，丢那妈（＠他妈的意思）！分几亩地，我恨不得一天把三天活都一齐干完；我天天盼望快打到我家去，现在我不行了，不能再革命了，我希望革命永远不要忘了我呀！”
    朱如茂兴奋的一口气说了下去，眼巴巴的望着二排长，好象在等着排长的回答。
    “老朱！放心吧！总有一天我们会打到你家乡的！斗争，分田”。
    殷红的血，已经浸透了绷带；朱如茂的嘴唇虽然还在蠕动，但是，再也听不出来他说的是什么了。淡白色的月光下，隐约的可以看见朱如茂的微笑的面孔。
    朱如茂是今年一月在亳州解放过来的，正如他自己所说，一过黄河，北上后，他就转变了，变得格外的积极了，啥事都抢先干，无论行几天军，一挺机枪永远放在他的肩上，说啥也不肯叫别人替换。打汲县外围和汤阴时，土工作业，他总是第一个拿起锄头，最后一个放下锄头。
    班里开诉苦会，他激昂愤怒的，带着浓厚的广东口音，对大家说话。辟头一句话就是：“丢他妈！我家八口人，才三亩地；三亩地打的粮，还不够交租和他妈的税；我家欠地主的钱，是一年压一年，一年比一年多，民国二十八年，我十七岁的时候，地主不答应了，罚我全家八口人，给他做了整整一夏天的工——盖房；三十二年欠的钱更多了，老财硬叫保长把我哥哥拖去卖壮丁，顶还了他一部分钱。我知道，再过几年又该轮到我卖壮丁还账了，想不到，我出来还不如我哥哥，三十三年，我东家——老财当了保长，把我抓来当兵，说什么算是利钱………。”
    这次汤阴战斗，外壕离敌人只十几米达远，他为了有力的掩护大家突破前沿，勇敢的把机枪拖到外壕边上打，一挺机枪打得通红，消灭敌人一百四五十人的大反扑，他左臂和脖子一连挂了两次彩。连长上来替换他，他说：“我怎么能下去啊！过去我当顽军，对不起革命，我替喝我血的地主蒋介石出力，我多悔呀！现在我一人要顶三个人打仗才对！”
    第三次子弹终于不幸打穿了他的头，核桃那么大的洞，他倒下了。是的！革命永远不会忘掉朱如茂的，总有一天我们要打到广东去，满足朱如茂斗争，分田的志愿。
