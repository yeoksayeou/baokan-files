　　Zhengding County Town Masses
    Settle Accounts with Traitor Wu Zanzhou
    Luan City Sixty-Six Villages Rise Up to Seek Revenge
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 4th] The anti-traitor and account-settling movement in Zhengding City is surging. The properties of arch-traitor Wu Zanzhou, the former puppet governor of Hebei Province, and Tao Jing'an, the puppet Tao Yin of Zhengding, have been completely confiscated and distributed to farmers and poor city residents. During the movement, landlords and local bullies constantly deceived, lured, and sabotaged, some seeking intermediaries to plead for them, using petty favors to buy off tenants and the poor. After being exposed and revealed, they attempted to divide the peasants and incite middle peasants to contribute their land, but this was thwarted by holding a forum for middle peasants, and the middle peasants joined the struggle. During the movement, the people greatly raised their class consciousness. For example, during the struggle in the Second District of the city, poor people and peasant women spontaneously monitored the activities of the bad elements. When the Fourth District struggled against the local tyrant Chuan Jimei, the masses spontaneously organized the struggle. According to preliminary statistics, in the twenty-plus days of the emancipation movement, farmers and poor city residents have obtained 748 mu of land (only within the city), 1,021 rooms, and other materials worth approximately 70 million yuan.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 4th] In Luancheng, a newly recovered area in central Hebei, sixty-six villages have carried out revenge and account settlement, with more than 12,000 people participating in the struggle, recovering more than 10,000 mu of land. The stubborn puppet Bao-Jia system has been completely destroyed. Temporary peasant associations have been established in all villages. According to extremely incomplete statistics, more than seventy new peasant associations have been added throughout the county, developing more than 8,000 members. Thirty villages have organized militias and established military committees. According to the experience of mobilizing the masses in various places, three methods are generally adopted: (1) Mass training of backbones to return to the village to lead the masses in emancipation. (2) When there are many cadres, each village is equipped with ten to twenty cadres to directly mobilize the masses. (3) While training the backbone, the cadres go directly to the village to mobilize. In the urban and rural areas of the first, second, and fourth districts of the county, more than one hundred villages have trained 1,900 backbones, with an average of one activist for every five to ten households.

　　正定城关群众
    清算汉奸吴赞周
    栾城六十六村群起复仇
    【新华社晋察冀四日电】正定城反奸清算运动高涨。原伪河北省长吴逆赞周、伪正定道尹遭逆敬俺等巨奸家产均被全部没收，分配于农民及贫苦市民。运动中，地主奸霸曾不断欺骗利诱破坏，有的则找人说合，以小惠收买佃户与贫民。被识破揭穿，又企图分化农民煽起中农献田，后经召开中农座谈会予以粉碎，中农参加了斗争。运动中，人民大大提高了阶级觉悟。如该市二区斗争时，贫民与农民妇女均自动监视坏蛋的活动。四区斗争恶霸传介眉时，群众自发的布置了斗争。二十余天的翻身运动中，据初步统计：农民与贫苦市民已获得土地七百四十八亩（只限城内地），房屋一千○二十一间，其他物资约值七千万元。
    【新华社晋察冀四日电】冀中新收复区栾城，已有六十六村进行了复仇清算，计参加斗争群众达一万二千以上，收回土地万余亩。顽伪保甲制度全部被摧毁。各村均建立了临时农会，据极不完整统计，全县新增农会七十多个，发展会员八千余名。三十个村组织了民兵，成立了武委会。按各地发动群众经验，一般采用了三种方法：（一）大量集训骨干，回村领导群众翻身。（二）干部多时，每村配备十至二十个干部，直接发动群众。（三）一面集训骨干，一面干部即下村直接发动。该县城厢一、二、四等区一百余村庄即集训了一千九百个骨干，平均每五户到十户即有一个积极分子。
