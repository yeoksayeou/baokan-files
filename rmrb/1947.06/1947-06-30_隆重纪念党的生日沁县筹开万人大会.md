　　[This Newspaper, Taiyue, 28th] To commemorate the Party's birthday "July 1st," the Qin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is preparing to hold a mass meeting of ten thousand people in the county seat on that day. The aim is to call on the 90,000 liberated peasants who have already obtained land to carry out the second revolution—a large-scale production movement—after completing the first revolution. The goal is to achieve mutual assistance in every village, labor for everyone, and ensure that everyone has food to eat and clothes to wear. The already organized mutual aid teams must be resolutely consolidated, and those not yet organized must be quickly organized to ensure the autumn seedlings are hoed well and the summer harvest is completed on time. Furthermore, all party members and cadres should be educated to perform meritorious service for the people in the production movement, and to implement the decision that cadres should contribute surplus fruits to help everyone achieve liberation. It is reported that the County Committee will commend Comrade Yan Dan, a model party member in Pandao Village, Seventh District, who is over fifty years old, and Comrade Li Zhaoxiang, a seventy-eight-year-old liberated hero from Nanchen, for their spirit of arduous struggle in persisting in secret work and transmitting Party newspapers during the eight years of the War of Resistance, and their love for the Party, to educate all party members.
