    Dong Jinde's Biography
    Dong Jinde is from Shangshui County, Henan Province, and is currently thirty-seven years old. On the ninth day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar in the 34th year of the Republic of China (1945), he was arrested by the Kuomintang soldiers who were rounding up deserters. They insisted he was a deserter. After being held in confinement for three months, he was assigned to the artillery platoon of the 374th Regiment of the 47th Division as a second-class private. As the unit moved from Henan to Hubei, he had to carry the forty-eight *jin* mortar base every day. When he asked the platoon leader to carry the mortar body, he was slapped twice. He was about to desert at Shaoerzhai when he was liberated by the Eighth Route Army.
    Dong Jinde Becomes a Platoon Leader
    Dong Jinde joined the Eighth Company of the Eighth Detachment in Nenjiang and immediately encountered a night march. He thought, "Life in the Eighth Route Army is hard, and the pay is low. I might as well desert and go home!" Later, he saw that the Eighth Route Army and the common people were like one family, and officers didn't scold or beat soldiers… Plus, with constant education, his thinking began to change. When the unit was near Longhuangji, a retired soldier told him, "The government gave me a house, land, and even helped me find a wife. Now I'm running a small business, and life is pretty good." Dong Jinde immediately thought, "If you're a soldier for Old Chiang, you deserve to be crippled, and they won't give you any house or land; if you die, you'll either be thrown into the river or fed to the dogs! If I work hard in the Eighth Route Army and perform meritorious service for the people, even if I'm disabled, there's still a way out." Dong Jinde's thinking slowly cleared up, he became more active in his work, and he was very brave in battle. Soon he was promoted to deputy squad leader, and in April of this year, he was promoted to squad leader.
    "The Platoon Leader Treats Me Better Than My Own Mother!"
    He often said in the platoon: As a platoon leader, you must care about the soldiers and not be arrogant. If the platoon leader is easily angered, the comrades in the platoon will not be at ease or happy. During marches, he often carried two rifles and two backpacks. Even if he had blisters on his feet, he wouldn't tell anyone. When Du Youcai was tired, he used storytelling and jokes to keep Du from falling behind. When new soldiers were assigned to the platoon, he automatically helped them find bowls and make their beds. Liu Guoqing, who was liberated from the 49th Brigade, was not used to eating millet. He explained, "When I first came from the 125th Brigade, I also wasn't used to eating millet, but after ten or fifteen days, millet becomes more and more fragrant. Rice is bland. Believe me, try it." While digging fortifications in Xiaosikong, each person was given five steamed buns. Dong Jinde ate three and left two for Liu Guoqing, who ate them when he was tired from digging. Liu Guoqing was moved and said, "The platoon leader treats me better than my own mother!"
    Platoon Leader Dong is a model in everything, which has a great impact on the whole platoon. Wang Heliang said, "Everyone is tired during the march and lies down to sleep, but our platoon leader boils water and brings it to us, calling us to drink water and wash our feet." Jie Xiaohei said, "When I first joined the Eighth Platoon, the platoon leader treated me very well, not asking me to fetch rice or do chores…"

    Doing What He Says, Saying What He Does, Solving What Needs to Be Solved
    In war, Dong Jinde is not only calm and resourceful but can also propose appropriate slogans to motivate the troops based on the specific situation. When attacking Sanliyao in Jixian County, the enemy fired several shells at us. The new soldiers were impatient, and he said, "Firing artillery at night is blind and inaccurate. I've fired artillery before, don't be afraid!" He immediately stabilized everyone's mood. The next day, when the enemy retreated, he designated targets for everyone to shoot at. He shot down two enemies with two shots, increasing everyone's confidence in shooting. The new soldier Wang Zhong was afraid to shoot, so he had him try one shot and asked, "Are you afraid?" Wang Zhong said, "No!" Then he fired twenty or thirty bullets in a row and said, "It turns out fighting is nothing! I used to hear that fighting was scary." A few hours before attacking Dasikong Village, the soldiers saw that we had several mountain guns. Dong Jinde immediately said, "With so many cannons, we don't have to be afraid of wiping out the enemy!" When our mountain guns bombarded the enemy's walls and碉堡, Dong Jinde clapped his hands and laughed, saying to the new soldiers, "Comrades, look how accurate our cannons are. The way our Eighth Route Army fights is to use artillery first, destroying碉堡 and walls, using firepower to suppress the enemy so they can't raise their heads, opening up roads for the infantry. As long as the infantry acts bravely, they will succeed with one charge."
    Dong Jinde's slogan to mobilize the whole platoon to dig fortifications was: "Old comrades should not rely on new comrades! New comrades should learn from old comrades." When planes came, the comrades were a little scared. Dong Jinde said, "Don't be afraid, the planes shoot forward. If they come from the east, you stick to the east wall of the trench, if they come from the west, you stick to the west wall." When enemy bullets flew over and the new soldiers were afraid, he explained, "Don't be afraid, comrade, you hear the bullets *swoosh! swoosh!* Those bullets are who-knows-how-high up there. Look, I'm standing here and not afraid! If you hear the bullets *thump thump*, that means they're close, so be careful!" After hearing this, Jie Xiaohei and Mi Xiaosan dug with peace of mind. When digging close to the enemy, some comrades kept looking up, so they couldn't dig fast. Dong Jinde said, "Send two people to monitor the enemy, and we'll all face our butts towards the enemy and dig with peace of mind. Those who dig don't look at the shooting, and those who shoot don't look at the digging."
    The soldier Wang Heting said, "I didn't have courage in the Seventh Platoon, but I have courage in the Eighth Platoon!" His speed of digging fortifications was twice as fast as others, and he dug very well. After finishing, he also helped other platoons dig. The soldiers were very willing to accept his technical leadership.
    Maintaining Discipline Boosts Soldiers' Courage
    Dong Jinde also paid great attention to discipline. Once, while digging a trench, there was a wheat field in front of them. He told them to dig along the edge of the wheat field. Wang Heting asked him, "Why?" He said, "If we sweat a little more, we can save a few seedlings!" After entering Dasikong, they saw several packages. Dong Jinde immediately said, "No one is allowed to touch them; if they do, the common people will be unhappy, and our blood will be shed in vain!" Under the leadership of Comrade Dong Jinde, everyone in the Eighth Platoon was very happy. Soldiers from other platoons asked to be transferred to his platoon, mainly because Comrade Dong Jinde cared about the soldiers, spoke kindly, and influenced everyone with his exemplary actions. In tense combat situations, he could promptly propose encouraging slogans to boost the soldiers' courage.

　　董金德班
    又一个王克勤班
    何朋、法生
    董金德的简历
    董金德是河南商水县人，现年三十七岁，民国三十四年九月初九，被国民党抓逃兵的硬说他是逃兵，坐了三个月禁闭后，被拨到四七师三七四团炮兵排当二等兵，队伍从河南往湖北出发，他每天要扛着四十八市斤的迫击炮座，他要求排长扛炮身挨了两个耳光。到了邵耳砦正准备开小差，就被八路军解放了。
    董金德当了班长
    董金德刚到嫩江八分队八连就赶上夜行军，心想：“八路军生活苦饷又少，还是开小差回家吧！”后来他看到八路军和老百姓是一家人，官长不打骂士兵，……加上不断受到教育，他的思想开始有了转变。部队到龙皇集附近，一位荣退军人告他说：“政府给我房子、地，还帮助找了个老婆，现在做个小生意，生活还很好。”董金德便马上想到“给老蒋当兵，打残了活该你受罪，还给你什么房子地；要是死了，不是丢到河里也是喂了狗！在八路军里好好干为人民立功，就是残废了，也有出路。”董金德的思想慢慢想通了，工作积极起来，作战非常勇敢，不久被提升为副班长，今年四月又升任班长。
    “班长待我比俺娘还亲哩！”
    他经常在班里说：当班长要关心战士，不能起态度，如果班长好发脾气，班里同志就不会安心，不会高兴的。行军时，他经常背两枝步枪，两个背包，自己脚上打了泡，不向别人说。杜有才走的疲劳了，他用说故事讲笑话的方法使杜不掉队。新战士刚补充到班里，他自动帮助找碗、铺床铺。四十九旅解放过来的刘国清吃不惯小米，他解释：“我从一二五旅初来，也是吃不惯小米，可是过了十天半月小米越吃越香，大米是淡的，不信你试试。”在小司空挖工事，每人发五个馍，董金德吃了三个留下两个，刘国清挖工事累了就给他吃，刘国清感动说：“班长待我比俺娘还亲哩！”
    董班长处处模范，对全班影响很大。王合亮说：“行军中大家都疲劳，躺倒就睡觉，可是俺们班长烧好水端来，叫起大家喝水洗脚。”解小黑说：“参军刚到八班，班长照呼俺就好，不叫去打饭，也不叫俺做勤务……”。
    干啥说啥解决啥
    在战争中董金德不仅沉着有办法，而且能根据具体情况提出适当的口号鼓动部队。攻打汲县三里窑时，敌人向我们打了几发炮弹，新战士沉不住气，他说：“夜间打炮是瞎打没准，我以前打过炮，不要害怕！”马上稳定了大家情绪。第二天敌人撤退，他指定了目标叫大家打，他两枪打倒两个敌人，提高了大家射击信心。新战士王忠不敢打枪，他叫他试打了一枪，问：“害怕不害怕？”王忠说：“不害怕！”接着一连打了二十多发子弹说：“闹了半天，打仗原来没有啥！过去听说打仗可害怕啦。”攻大司空村前两三小时，战士看见我们有好几门山炮，董金德马上提出：“咱们有这么多的炮，还怕消灭不了敌人！”当我们山炮向敌人围墙碉堡轰击的时候，董金德拍手大笑对新战士说：“同志们你看我们炮打多准，咱们八路军打仗就是先用炮，打垮碉堡围墙，用火力压得敌人抬不起头，给步兵开辟出道路，只要步兵动作勇猛，一冲就成功。”
    董金德动员全班挖工事的口号是：“老同志不要依靠新同志！新同志要向老同志学习。”飞机来了，同志们有些害怕，董金德说：“不要怕，飞机是往前打的，从东来，你靠交通沟的东墙，从西来你靠西墙。”当敌人子弹打过来新战士害怕，他解释：“不用怕，同志，你听子弹嗖！嗖！的，那子弹不知道多高咧，你看我在这里立着就不怕！如果你听子弹噗噗的响，是在跟前咧，那就小心点！”解小黑、米小三二人听罢，很放心的挖起来。挖的离敌人近了，有的同志不住的抬头看，挖不快，董金德说：“派两个人监视敌方，咱们都屁股朝着敌人放心挖，挖的不看打，打的不看挖。”
    战士王合亭说：“我在七班没胆，到八班有了胆啦！”他挖工事的速度，比别人快一倍，而且还挖的很好，挖完了还帮助其他班挖。战士很愿接受他的技术领导。
    守纪律给战士壮胆
    在纪律问题上董金德也是非常注意，有一次挖交通沟前面有块麦地，他叫沿着麦地边挖。王合亭问他“为啥？”他说“我们多流点汗，就可救活几根青苗！”打进大司空，看见有几个包袱，董金德马上提出“谁也不准动；动了老百姓就会不满意，我们的血就是白流了！”八班在董金德同志领导下，大家都很高兴，别班的战士要求调到他班，主要是董金德同志关心战士，说话和气，处处以自己的模范行动去影响大家，在紧张的战斗情况下，能及时提出鼓动口号给战士壮胆。
