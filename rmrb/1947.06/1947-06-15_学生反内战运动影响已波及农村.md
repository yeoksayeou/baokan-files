　　Student Anti-Civil War Movement
    Influence Reaches Rural Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 12th] According to Tianjin reports: Northern press circles believe that the partial resumption of classes in some schools marks a new beginning for the people's anti-civil war movement. The Ta Kung Pao stated: "Even if schools resume classes, the student movement shows no signs of ending." The newspaper also pointed out that continued strikes in various places due to new tragedies may "affect the whole situation with the slightest move." The Yi Shih Pao called this movement a "third force" movement representing the people, and it directly affected the vast rural areas outside the city. Large numbers of declarations and leaflets to citizens broke through Chiang's police blockade and reached the hands of farmers, gaining widespread support.

　　学生反内战运动
    影响已波及农村
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据天津讯：北间报界认为部分学校开始停止罢课，乃反内战人民运动另一新的开始。大公报称：“纵令各校复课，但学生运动仍无终止征象”。该报并指出各地因新的惨案而持续罢课，即可能“每牵一发而动全体”的。益世报对此一运动，称之为代表人民之“第三势力”运动，并直接波及城外广大农村，大批宣言告市民传单冲破蒋记宪警封锁，传到农民手中，获得广泛拥护。
