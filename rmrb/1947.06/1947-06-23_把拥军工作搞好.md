　　Do a Good Job of Supporting the Army
    良弼
    This time, I participated in the work of the Taihang District Frontline慰问团(comfort group) and spent more than a month on the front line. This work has made me deeply and specifically understand the hard work of the soldiers on the front. The bravery of the soldiers is truly commendable and moving. I heard from the leaders of the 49th Regiment that Comrade Li Huicheng, the排长(platoon leader) of the 1st Platoon of the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion (from Hexi Village, 5th District, Huguan), was tasked with leading a ten-person ladder team during the siege. After completing this task, he automatically turned the ladder team into an assault team, first climbing the city and engaging in fierce fighting with the enemy, attracting the enemy's firepower and facilitating the rapid ascent of other comrades. This comrade gloriously sacrificed his life and was awarded a special merit. When his body was pulled down, it was seen that he still had twenty-seven hand grenade strings hanging on his right index finger. Also, Comrade Liu Xuetian, the political instructor of the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion, said to the soldiers during the siege: "We must open up Tangyin City and capture Sun Dianying alive. It is better to sacrifice in the city than outside the city." This comrade also gloriously gave his life after completing the task. Like these commendable and moving heroic stories, I have heard dozens of them alone. After listening to the heartfelt introductions, I was often moved to tears. The noble quality of the people's commanders and fighters sacrificing themselves for the welfare of the masses is truly incomparable.
    After this trip, I am deeply ashamed that we rear area workers have failed the soldiers on the front in many ways, especially in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military families. It is truly our shame that this work is not done well.
    When I was in the 9th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the 49th Regiment, having a discussion with all the comrades, one comrade pointed out that his family had insufficient labor, and the village restricted them from using water even though they helped fetch it. In addition, the mother of martyr Gai Facun of Shenjiao Village, Huguan County, was allocated three buildings in the land reform movement, but she is still being occupied by landlords. It was only recently that this was corrected.
    Although such situations are extremely individual, they also show that there are indeed problems in our work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment. We should conduct a serious, universal and thorough inspection in conjunction with our current work. On the one hand, we must regularly publicize the heroic deeds of the heroes on the front among the masses. At the same time, we must seriously, universally, and continuously check the work of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers and martyrs, and report to the front in a timely manner. In particular, the land reform movement should be done thoroughly. Not only should no military family be deprived of practical benefits, but no ordinary people should be allowed to be not thoroughly liberated. Because, why did comrades like Li Huicheng and Liu Xuetian bravely sacrifice their lives? Isn't it precisely to defend the land and achieve complete liberation? Only when we do these tasks well in the rear can we further consolidate the troops and enhance combat effectiveness!

　　把拥军工作搞好
    良弼
    这次参加太行区前线慰问团的工作，在前线走了一个多月。这段工作，使我深切具体的领会了前方将士的辛苦。战士们的英勇，真是可歌可泣。听四九团首长谈：一营一连一排长李会成同志（壶关五区河西村人），在攻城时，他的任务是带领十人的架梯组。完成这项任务后，他自动把架梯组变为突击组，首先登上城去和敌人激战，吸引了敌人的火力，便利了其他同志的迅速登城。这位同志光荣牺牲了，立了特功，当拉下他的尸首后，见他右食指上还挂着二十七根手榴弹线绳。还有一营三连政指刘学田同志，攻城的时候，他同战士们说：“我们要打开汤阴城，活捉孙殿英，能牺牲在城里，不牺牲在城外。”这位同志也于完成任务后，光荣殉国了。像这样可歌可泣的英勇故事，单我一人就听到几十起。我听了亲切的介绍，常常感动得流下泪来，人民的指战员这种为群众谋福利而牺牲自己的崇高品质，真是无可比拟的。
    走过这一趟后，我深深惭愧我们后方工作者，有许多地方对不起前方将士，特别是拥军，优待军属的工作作不好，真是我们的耻辱。
    当我在四九团三营九连与全体同志们座谈时，有一位同志提出他家劳力不足，村上代为挑水却限制他们少用。另外，壶关县神郊村，烈属盖法存母亲，翻身运动中分得楼房三间，到现在仍被地主霸占着不让住。直到最近才算纠正了。
    像这样的情况虽极个别，但也说明我们拥优工作中确乎是存在有问题的。我们应当结合当前工作进行认真的普遍的大检查。一方面要把前方功臣们的英勇事迹经常地在群众中宣传，同时要认真普遍不断的检查拥军优抗工作，及时信告前方。尤其是土地改革运动，更应当彻底作好，不仅不应让一家军属享不到实惠，而且不容有一个老百姓不彻底翻身。因为，像李会成、刘学田等同志，他们为什么英勇牺牲呢？不正是为了保卫土地，彻底翻身吗？只有我们在后方把这些工作作好，才能更加巩固部队和增进战斗力！
