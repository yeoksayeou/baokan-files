　　Enhance Troop Combat Effectiveness, Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive
    Tense Military Training in Northern Henan and Southern Shanxi
    [Report from the Northern Henan Front by this newspaper] The Huaihe troops under General Liu Bocheng in Northern Henan are currently intensifying their military training. All cadres and soldiers are involved in this wave, responding to the call to fully prepare for the major counteroffensive. The morale of the troops is exceptionally high. In the hero Wang Xuezhi's squad of the Third Battalion, everyone came up with ideas and worked hard. In just a few days, newly enlisted soldiers learned the basic combat techniques, and the average hand grenade throwing distance was over 40 meters. Du Changhai, in order to accelerate the training of machine gunners, preferred to forgo his afternoon nap to teach new comrades. The new soldiers were also willing to work hard to learn skills. Many liberated soldiers contributed their past skills without reservation, because they wanted to use the skills that Chiang Kai-shek taught them to fight Chiang Kai-shek, so as to liberate their hometowns. Comrade Xie Liang, a sharpshooter from the Second Battalion, proposed to guarantee that the entire squad would use, learn to disassemble, and reassemble machine guns. The artillery company of the First Battalion enthusiastically launched a military training mutual assistance competition, researching the causes of firing deviations and how to overcome them. Everyone advocated using their brains to train, and many comrades practiced street fighting as soon as they left the barracks, throwing hand grenades while walking, and constantly studying shooting positions and terrain. Thanks to the efforts of all comrades, the combat effectiveness of the unit is increasing day by day. The soldiers, with unwavering confidence, look forward to the early arrival of the major counteroffensive.

    [Report from the Taiyue Front by this newspaper, 13th] After the merit celebration, the morale of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in Southern Shanxi has risen even higher, and a fierce military training movement has been launched. In the eighth and ninth squads of the Seventh Company, even when the sun was scorching hot during the daily afternoon nap, squad leaders Ma Changbang and Cui Quanshui still led everyone outside to throw grenades. He Jiemin, the machine gun squad leader, often led his comrades outside to measure distances during the afternoon nap. His clothes were soaked with sweat, but he took them off and continued training. At night, when everyone else was asleep, his squad was still practicing aiming. The Du Wenfa squad of the Eighth Company went to the field to practice every day before dawn. Shi Lairen, a special-class combat hero of the Second Battalion, was ill, but he still frequently led his entire squad in drills. Jiao Guohua of the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion continued to work without rest despite having sores on the soles of his feet. In order to improve skills, artillerymen, engineers, light and heavy machine gunners, and small mortar operators were also concentrated for specialized training. They were just as tense as the infantry, and achieved significant results in a very short time. Xin Duihai of the Third Battalion initially threw grenades only 17 meters, but now has increased it to 24 meters. Jin Zhenzhou originally threw 21 meters, but now has increased it to 28 meters. Wang Shouchang of the Second Battalion invented a new aiming method for small mortars, hitting every target. He can directly penetrate gun holes and destroy bunkers from beyond 100 meters.

    【本报太岳前线十三日电】晋南人民解放军某部在贺功大会后，士气更形高涨，又掀起激烈的练兵运动。七连八、九班每天午睡时，太阳热如火，班长马长邦、崔泉水还带着大家在外面投弹。机枪班组长何介民，经常在午睡时领导小组的同志到外面测量距离，汗湿了衣服，脱了再练。晚上人都睡觉了，他们班里还在瞄准。八连杜文法小组，每天天不亮就到野外演习。二营特等战斗英雄时来人生了病，还是经常带领全班操练。三营九连焦国华脚掌生了疮仍不休息。为使技术提高，炮兵、工兵轻重机枪手、小炮手等也都集中起来作专门训练。与步兵一样紧张，在很短时间即有显著成绩。三营辛对孩开始投弹只十七米，现已增到二十四米。金振周原来投二十一米，现在增到二十八米。二营王守成的小炮发明了新的瞄准方法，颗颗命中，能在一百米以外直穿枪眼，炸毁碉堡。
