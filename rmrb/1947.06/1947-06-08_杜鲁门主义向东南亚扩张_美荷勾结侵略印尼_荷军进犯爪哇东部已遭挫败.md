Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 6th: TASS, The Hague reports: Dutch newspapers continue to report on the interference of the United States in the Dutch-Indonesian issue and the expansion of the Truman Doctrine into Indonesia. The popular Amsterdam city magazine, the banking journal "Elseviers" reported: This week the United States sent a note to the Dutch government, expressing concern about the nationalist tendencies in Southeast Asia, stating definitively that this tendency has "a communist nature," and the United States intends that the people of Southeast Asia "continue to rely on Western democracies." The Americans are willing to use their dollars to help with the recovery of Indonesia. The "Waarheid" newspaper, in a prominent headline "Truman's Policy in Indonesia," stated: The United States is expanding the Truman Doctrine to Indonesia in order to take over Britain's responsibilities in Southeast Asia. The report stated: Most Dutch ministers agree to conduct a large-scale war in Indonesia with the help of the United States; an American military delegation headed by Lieutenant Colonel Eaton inspected the Dutch armed forces and visited Indonesia. There, they studied the timing of a war against the Indonesian people with the help of American weapons.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 5th: TASS, The Hague reports: It is reported that the Indonesian Republic government has begun to discuss the Dutch ultimatum, which includes the following requirements: the establishment of an all-Indonesian government; the establishment of all-Indonesian police and army; the return of factories to Dutch factory owners; the cessation of all direct relations between the Republic and other countries, etc. The "Waarheid" newspaper commented on the Dutch ultimatum, stating: The independence of the Republic is in danger. The ultimatum demands the establishment of Dutch monopoly rule, handing over the Republic's defense to the Netherlands, and establishing Dutch police and troops on the Republic's territory. According to reports from Batavia, Indonesian newspapers strongly protested the Dutch ultimatum, pointing out that the Dutch ultimatum infringes on the freedom of the Indonesian Republic. Reports state that at a mass meeting in Cirebon, Indonesian Republic Vice President Hatta declared: "We have long been prepared to fulfill the treaty signed in Cirebon; the Netherlands assures that they are also working hard to complete the aforementioned treaty, but so far they have done nothing. The treaty clearly stipulates: the withdrawal of Dutch armed forces and the return of Dutch-occupied territories to the Republic, but all these remain empty words. From all indications, the Netherlands actually wants to abolish the treaty signed under the pressure of world public opinion."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 6th: According to TASS, The Hague: It is reported that under the order of the Dutch government, another 1,250 Dutch soldiers were sent to Indonesia on May 31. Antara News Agency reported: Last week, the Indonesian people and Dutch troops engaged in battle in eastern Java. Antara News Agency reported: In the past few days, Dutch artillery continuously bombarded the city of Modjokerto, and the Dutch infantry's attack on the area has been repelled by the Indonesian people.

　　杜鲁门主义向东南亚扩张
    美荷勾结侵略印尼
    荷军进犯爪哇东部已遭挫败
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社海牙讯：关于美国对荷兰与印尼问题的干涉，及杜鲁门主义向印尼之扩张，荷兰报纸继作报导。流行的阿姆斯特丹城杂志，银行界机关刊物《爱尔西维茨》报导：本星期美国送交荷兰政府一照会，表示对于东南亚民族主义倾向之忧虑，确言这一种倾向有“共产主义的性质”，美国意欲东南亚之人民“继续依靠西方民主国”。美人愿意以其金元供作印尼复员之用。瓦尔海德报在显著标题“杜鲁门在印尼之政策”一文中称：美国正扩张杜鲁门主义至印尼，以期接收英国在东南亚之职责。该报报导称：大部分的荷兰部长赞成以美国的帮助在印尼进行大规模的战争；以伊敦中校为首之美国军事代表团视察了荷兰的武装部队，并访问了印尼。在该地，他们研究了以美国武器的帮助进行反印尼人民之战争的时机。
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社海牙讯：据报载：印尼共和国政府开始讨论荷兰之最后通谍，该最后通谍包含以下各项要求：成立全印尼政府；成立全印尼之警察与军队；将工厂归还荷兰厂主；停止共和国与其他各国所有之直接关系等等。瓦尔海德报评荷兰最后通谍称：共和国之独立遭受了危险，最后通谍要求建立荷兰垄断公司的统治，把共和国的国防交与荷兰，并在共和国领土上建立荷兰的警察和军队。据巴达维亚报导，印尼各报纸坚决抗议荷兰之通后通谍，指出荷兰之最后通谍侵害着印尼共和国的自由。报载：在井里汶群众大会上印尼共和国副总统哈达宣称：“我们久已准备履行在井里汶签订之条约；荷兰保证他们也努力去完成上述条约，然而至今他们什么也没有做。条约明白的规定：撤出荷兰武装部队，归还荷兰占领之领土予共和国，但是所有这些仍然是一纸空文。从所有的象征来看，荷兰实际上是想废止在世界舆论压力下所签订的条约。”
    【新华社陕北六日电】据塔斯社海牙讯：据报载：在荷兰政府命令下，又有一千二百五十名荷兰士兵于五月三十一日派赴印尼。安普通讯社报导：上周印尼人民与荷兰军队在爪哇东部进行战斗。安诺特拉通讯社报导：过去几日，荷兰大炮连续轰击谟德捷克尔托城，荷兰步兵进攻该区，已被印尼人民击溃。
