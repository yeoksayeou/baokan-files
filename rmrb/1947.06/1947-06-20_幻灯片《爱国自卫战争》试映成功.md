　　The third part of the film "A Brief History of the People's Liberation Army's Struggle," entitled "Patriotic Self-Defense War," produced by the slide group of the Frontline Visiting and慰问团of the Military and Political University, was successfully previewed at Yezheng on the 10th. This film includes battle scenes from the Shangdang to the Henan-North campaigns. The land reform in the Liberated Areas, the peasant participation in the army movement, the Wang Keqin class, etc., total more than two hundred and eighty pictures. In addition, many "Anti-Tank" pictures were drawn, specifically introducing the structure of tanks and various anti-tank tactics. After the successful preview, the Field Headquarters and the Political Department specially wrote letters to the slide group to express their appreciation, and awarded them 30,000 Jibi. The慰问团 letter from Yezheng said: "You have gone deep into the troops in the front to perform slide shows, which have won the welcome of the broad masses of soldiers. This spirit of serving the soldiers and working actively is worth learning. This is a new contribution to the propaganda work of the troops and can be widely promoted in the troops." The慰问团 letter from the Headquarters praised their achievements as "a brilliant achievement of the combination of thought and technical skills." The Yezheng Cultural Troupe No. 106 and the Taihang Military Region Propaganda Team are currently rushing to produce equipment and draw films to launch the slide movement.
