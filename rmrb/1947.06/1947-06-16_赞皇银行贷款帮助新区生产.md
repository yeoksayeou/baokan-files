　　[Report from Zanhuang] After the recapture of the puppet strongholds in the recent Yuanshi campaign, the masses in the new district experienced considerable difficulties in production. To assist the masses in the area to resume production smoothly, the Zanhuang branch of the Jinnan Bank has allocated 8 million yuan for the third production loan. Each village also held an enlarged cadre meeting to discuss combining the loan with the temple fair in the city on the 24th day of the third lunar month, and to make a three-day concentrated effort to distribute the loans to the masses, so that they could buy livestock and farm tools at the fair. After Bailu Village received 270,000 yuan in loans, they bought five heads of livestock that same day.

　　赞皇银行贷款帮助新区生产
    【本报赞皇讯】这次元氏战役，顽伪据点收复后，新区群众生产颇感困难。为帮助该地群众顺利生产，冀南银行赞皇支行，特拨发第三次生产贷款八百万元。各村并开扩大干部会议，讨论结合城里阴历三月二十四的庙会，三天突击贷到群众手里，趁会即可买上牲口农具。白鹿村贷到款二十七万后当天买了五头牲口。
