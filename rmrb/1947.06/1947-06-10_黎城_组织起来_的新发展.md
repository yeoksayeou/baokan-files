　　New Development of "Organized" Licheng
    Licheng United Office
    Licheng's mutual aid organization, based on the three-year great production movement, has developed greatly this year to adapt to the new situation and new requirements. The following are studies and introductions of several major issues for reference:
    I. New Situation, New Characteristics, and New Organizational Forms
    After the land reform movement, farmers obtained land, houses, and livestock. Due to the thorough solution of basic production conditions—satisfying farmers' land demands, the desire for production to become rich was unprecedentedly high. Facts have proven that farmers' production enthusiasm this year is even higher than in previous years. To universally achieve the goal of "cultivating three and surplus one," the vast majority of farmers not only engage in agricultural production but also actively organize sideline production based on specific conditions. On the other hand, newly emancipated farmers still face significant difficulties in production, primarily in terms of tools, fertilizers, and livestock. To comprehensively and effectively carry out production and overcome production difficulties, emancipated farmers are more eager than ever to universally organize mutual aid and cooperative labor. At the same time, heavy war duties have created an unprecedented labor shortage. To overcome the labor shortage and ensure that both war duties and production are not delayed, it is necessary to further comprehensively organize to maximize all labor and implement cooperative labor for war duties and production. Secondly, due to the spring drought, overcoming the drought and planting seeds requires the collective efforts of mutual aid and cooperative labor.
    Due to the above new circumstances, a general characteristic of this year's mutual aid organization is its universality and breadth. Since the launch of spring plowing production this year, all corners of the county have automatically and universally organized under new requirements. The scope of mutual aid groups has expanded (generally to more than ten households), organizing all men, women, old and young, and children to implement cooperative labor with labor and livestock, male and female labor, agriculture, sideline occupations, and war duty production. Due to different work foundations and specific conditions in various places, the following organizational forms have emerged: 1. Combination of agriculture, sideline occupations, and war duties with unified cooperative labor in textile production—In mutual aid organizations in villages such as Xihuangxu, Langou, and Qingquan, agricultural production is combined with all sideline occupations (transportation, workshops, textiles...) and unified cooperative labor for participation in war and corvee labor, with work points calculated and profits distributed. The advantage of this organization is that it not only solves the contradiction between agricultural and sideline production and war duties but also promotes the labor of the old, young, and women, overcoming the labor shortage. In the words of the masses, "Everything can be done well without delay." 2. Combination of agriculture, sideline occupations, and war duties—Villages such as Huojiayao, Xiazhuang, and Beiliu all adopt the method of combining general sideline occupations (excluding textiles) with war duties. This form is the most common. The difference from the previous type is that textiles are not organized internally (textiles are organized independently, but women can still participate in agricultural and sideline production and receive cooperative labor). 3. Combination of agriculture and sideline occupations—Villages such as Yantouling and Wushimu adopt the method of mutual aid and cooperative labor for agriculture and sideline production. It is not combined with war duties. This form is small in number. 4. Land Cooperative—This year, Beishe Jiusong created a type of land cooperative. The entire group (six households) engages in agricultural production. Land is invested according to output (capital shares), and labor is invested according to work points (labor shares). For sideline production, livestock and carts are valued and invested (capital shares), and labor is invested according to work points (labor shares). Collective management is implemented, and production costs are collectively responsible. Agricultural and sideline profits are distributed separately. In agricultural profits, capital shares receive 25%, labor shares receive 70%, and 5% is used to reward active production elements. In sideline profits, capital shares receive 70%, labor shares receive 25%, and 5% is used to reward active production elements. Labor shares are unified for agriculture and sideline occupations. This method is currently being tested.
    II. Three Major Combinations
    Based on the new situation and new requirements of this year's great production movement, the basic guiding principle for mutual aid organization this year is to universally promote mutual aid organizations that combine agriculture as the main focus with sideline occupations and war duties. To this end, unified cooperative labor with work point calculation and profit distribution should be implemented, strict equivalent pricing policies, unified wages, and attention should be paid to the profits earned by surplus labor and expanding the scope of mutual aid. The specific implementation of the three major combinations in mutual aid organizations is studied separately below:
    A. The guiding ideology of prioritizing agriculture should be implemented in mutual aid organizations: There are two methods for organizing agricultural and sideline production: One is to extract surplus labor from agricultural production for long-term sideline production based on the conditions of the entire group or team's labor, livestock, land, and circumstances. For example, transportation teams in villages such as Huojiayao, Xiwu, and Renzhuang, and oil presses, cotton ginning, cotton carding, and rope spinning in villages such as Xiazhuang, Beiliu, Xihuangxu, and Xijing. Or, during agricultural slack periods, organize surplus labor and livestock for temporary sideline production, such as digging medicinal herbs in Langou, cutting mountain goods in Wangjiazhuang, and temporarily organizing transportation. In short, all surplus labor and livestock in agricultural production should be fully organized into sideline production without violating agricultural principles. The other is under the support of the idea of "emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture," thinking that "repairing edges and strengthening seedlings is not worthwhile, and active labor (referring to engaging in sideline occupations) can be done," believing that farming is incidental, and investing a large amount of labor and livestock in sideline production. Often, at the critical juncture of agricultural production, they insist on pursuing large sums of money, causing agricultural production to be affected. The former combines sideline occupations with agriculture as the main focus, while the latter violates this principle, which will inevitably lead to a reduction in grain and cotton yields, directly affecting military and civilian food needs. We definitely affirm the former and correct the latter deviation. It is correct to organize sideline production well, but mutual aid organizations must, under the principle of prioritizing agriculture, deep plowing, intensive cultivation, and improving technology, extract surplus labor through precise calculation to organize long-term or temporary sideline production. Therefore, we have promoted the former approach and corrected the latter deviation.
    B. Unified use of labor and livestock: To organize various agricultural and sideline production activities and serve war duties in a planned way, we unified the use of organized labor and livestock. The basic unit of use is the mutual aid group, which can uniformly allocate resources based on the urgency of life and labor and livestock conditions. When necessary, adjustments can be made by the team or village. For example, Wang Jinming's team in Xiazhuang has two people and two mules dedicated to transportation, three people dedicated to the oil press, and the rest farm and serve war duties. In a specific production activity, there should also be unified and specific division of labor. For example, in carrying water and planting cotton, Yang Shuan's team in Shiban has two old men dedicated to plowing (with good skills), three old men dedicated to digging furrows (with good technology), and the remaining three old men and seven large children drop seeds, water, fertilize, and bury furrows. Three young adults carry water, and nineteen young adults transport water, planting one section at a time, making it easy to complete an urgent task quickly, and it is also convenient for the leadership to grasp the plan and give full play to everyone's abilities.
    C. Unified cooperative labor according to work point value: In carrying out various production and war duty tasks, the standard labor (general labor) and agricultural production work points (ten points) are used as the standard. According to efficiency and technical level, work is assigned according to work point value, and work points are flexibly determined. Individuals and organizations interact, and various types of work can be mutually exchanged. Accounts are settled based on actual input and actual use of labor. The method of calculating work points for agriculture and sideline occupations in Xihuangxu is: Agricultural work points are temporarily determined according to specific living standards. For transportation, livestock carrying 100 jin back and forth 60 li is worth ten points (return trip is also worth points). People participating in transportation also earn ten points per day, but to promote their enthusiasm, they are awarded two points per day for a total of twelve points (including meals). For sideline production, 10,000 yuan of capital per month earns three work points (30 points). In addition, the method of calculating work points in combination with textiles is: For off-site textile production, spinning one jin of first-class thread earns eleven points, spinning one jin of second-class thread earns ten points; weaving one jin of first-class cloth earns ten points, weaving one jin and four taels of second-class cloth earns ten points; in-factory sizing three jin of thread earns one point, fluffing two jin of thread earns three points, warping one jin of thread earns one point, weaving one machine earns six points, knitting one jin of net earns one point, weaving two chi of first-class cloth earns one point, weaving two and a half chi of second-class cloth earns one point, weaving two towels earns one point, arranging one set of reeds earns six points, and a full machine earns two and a half workdays (25 points) per month, and an empty machine earns one workday (ten points) per month. The method of calculating work points for the combination of war duties and production: In Xiazhuang, participants in the war effort earn ten points per day, and those who perform well earn two points per day. Those who perform day labor are the same as those who farm, those who perform two days of labor earn eleven points per day, and those who perform three or more days of labor earn twelve points per day. Livestock carrying 100 jin per day earns ten points, and auxiliary labor helping to deliver messages and guard posts earns the same fixed work points as participating in agricultural production. Huojiayao's war participants earn ten points per day, and if they perform meritorious service at the front line, they earn eleven points per day. Experience has shown that it is appropriate to take care of the lives of people and livestock serving in the war effort. Therefore, it is correct that war participants eat public food and do not deduct food at home. Awarding work points for meritorious service at the front line can stimulate their enthusiasm for participating in the war effort. Those who perform corvee labor for people and livestock earn more work points than farming to compensate for their extra consumption outside. The allocation of war duties is basically better to rotate and combine adjustments. For convenience of allocation, mutual aid groups can set up anti-service group leaders. Because the method of calculating work points and unified cooperative labor is universally implemented in agricultural and sideline production and war duties, all semi-labor and auxiliary labor are mostly organized into mutual aid organizations, each contributing their strength and receiving their share. This not only overcomes the current labor difficulties but also solves the production difficulties of people without labor.
    D. Unified profit distribution: After organizing the extraction of surplus labor to engage in sideline production, the resulting profits, after deducting consumption and sideline wages, have three types of distribution methods: Xiwu extracts 5% to reward active elements, 5% to reward surplus labor, and 90% to be distributed to all group labor; Xijing extracts 10% to reward active elements, and the rest is entirely distributed to surplus labor; Langou extracts 5% to reward active elements, 20% to be distributed by capital, 10% to reward all group labor, and 65% to be distributed to surplus labor (all pre-rewarded the labor involved in engaging in the business). Based on the above three main types of profit distribution in the entire county, Xiwu distributes the vast majority of sideline profits to all group labor, excessively emphasizing that sideline production is the result of organization and neglecting that the actual participants in sideline production are surplus labor, which is inappropriate and should be improved (mutual aid production improves efficiency and squeezing out labor counts as well). Xijing completely denies general labor and distributes everything to surplus labor, which is also inappropriate and should appropriately take care of general labor. Langou grasps that surplus labor receives more and also takes care of the mutual aid production enthusiasm of all group labor. This distribution method can be greatly promoted. From this, we should definitely recognize that most of the sideline production profits should be distributed by surplus labor, but in order to better mutual aid production, a portion should also be extracted to reward active elements and all group labor in production. At the same time, sideline labor must also have certain rewards, but actual reporting of expenses is easy to waste, so fixed numbers are more appropriate, and the four-layer profit distribution should be correctly implemented.
    E. Unified wages and correct mastery of wage levels: To achieve mutual aid and cooperative labor in agricultural production and war duties within the entire village, we adopted a unified fixed wage system, because without unified wages, cooperative labor is impossible. However, this year's wage level is relatively high, generally around ten jin of rice. If we calculate the accounts, the practical wages for farming are higher than the actual grain harvested. Therefore, it is said that wages should not be so high, but it is an abnormal phenomenon in the case of labor shortage. This affects the mutual aid group's transportation losing money (the price of foot grain rises, the foot price relatively decreases, and transportation earns high wages), making it difficult to combine agriculture and sideline occupations. Because high wages shock the masses' thinking, create a labor panic mentality, and dare not spend more labor on deep plowing and intensive cultivation, they do not apply fertilizer, repair berms, or want to grow labor-intensive crops such as cotton. They want to grow simple bean crops, and even under the support of the idea of "it is not the land that feeds people, but people that feed the land," they do not want to farm. Therefore, we persuaded the masses to reduce wages to seven or eight jin of rice using accounting methods. In mastering the issue of wage levels, we must have a class perspective. This year, due to the dispersion of land, mutual aid production is basically a matter between farmers, and it is basically labor for labor (especially for widowed households). Wages are used to clear accounts outside of labor for labor. Therefore, if it is too high, it is of no benefit to agricultural production and also affects the active organization of sideline production (the mutual aid group has no profit), which will directly affect the consolidation and development of the mutual aid movement. However, for some wealthy households with more land and insufficient labor, we adopted the method of contracting work at market prices for the part where labor is insufficient, or attempting to exploit loopholes, so that we can absorb surplus labor into agricultural production.
    III. New Organizational Structure and New Leadership Methods
    Based on the new requirements in the development of the mutual aid production movement this year and the results of unified leadership implemented in the village, the production organizational structure and leadership methods of each village have been improved. Generally, the production committee is composed of major cadres of each system, labor heroes, mutual aid team leaders, etc. This organization is the highest leadership group for production work in the entire village. Its task is to study and summarize the specific organization and implementation of production work in the entire village, take production as the center, combine other various tasks, and unify plans and make appropriate arrangements. Each cadre takes production work as the central task, unifies leadership, and conducts work separately. For example, the Renzhuang Production Committee's determination of the ten-day work for the Guyu Festival is centered on transporting fertilizer, preparing cotton fields, and weeding wheat. It starts with discussing current affairs in the mutual aid group, conducts production mobilization and preparation, and further discusses how to perform meritorious service in production and participation in the war. After the work is determined, each cadre is assigned to each brigade to do the work through active elements, discovers models in individual meetings every day and praises them in a timely manner. Every third, sixth, and ninth day, cadres can study and discuss the work. If there are materials that can be promoted, they will be organized into communications immediately, so that study, work, and communication are combined. At the end of ten days, the production committee will be opened again to check, summarize, and rearrange. All work is uniformly studied and uniformly arranged through the production meeting, overcoming the problem of each system doing its own thing and pulling each other's legs. The production committee has a director, agricultural section, sideline occupation section, publicity and commendation section, textile section, etc. In addition to the mutual aid team leader, each mutual aid group has special personnel in charge of various tasks. For example, the Beiliu Mutual Aid Group has leaders for mutual aid, study, technology, martial arts, war duties, and public security; the Qingquan Mutual Aid Team has full and deputy team leaders, preferential treatment and resistance committee members, martial arts squad leader, work point recorder, textile committee member, agricultural technology committee member, transportation team leader, etc. This mutual aid organization has actually become a unified organizational form that combines various tasks with production work as the main focus. It is not only limited to organizing production but is actually the organizational foundation of various tasks at the lowest level. Facts have proven that it is difficult to succeed if all work is disconnected from production work and production organization. This further clarifies that system work must serve the central work—production work, and system work can only be built through central work. Only in this way can we concentrate our efforts to carry out the production movement.

　　黎城“组织起来”的新发展
    黎城联合办公室
    黎城互助组织，在三年大生产运动基础上，适应新的情况与新的要求，今年有很大发展。兹将几个主要问题分别研究，加以介绍供作参考：
    一、新情况新特点与新的组织形式
    经过土地改革运动，农民获得土地房屋及牲口，由于生产基本条件的彻底解决——满足了农民土地要求，生产发家致富要求空前提高，事实证明，今年农民生产热忱比那年也高，广大农民为了普遍达到耕三余一，不仅进行农业生产，而且根据具体条件，积极的组织副业生产，而另一方面新翻身农民在生产上，还有很大困难，首先是农具、肥料以及牲口等困难；翻身农民为了全面的很好的进行生产，克服生产上的困艰，因此就比任何一年更积极要求普遍组织起来互助变工生产。同时由于战勤繁重，造成劳力空前困难，为了克服劳力困难，使战勤与生产两不耽误，就必须更进一步全面组织起来，将所有劳力发扬到最高度，实行战勤与生产变工。其次由于春旱，为了抗旱下种，必须在互助变工集体努力下，才能战胜旱灾。
    由于上述新的情况，造成了今年互助组织中一个总的特点，是组织的普遍性与广泛性；今年发动春耕生产以来，全县各个角落在新的要求下，自动普遍的组织起来，互助组范围较前扩大了（一般在十户以上），它组织了所有男女老汉儿童一切劳力实行劳畜力，男女劳力、农副业、战勤生产互助大变工；由于各地工作基础与具体条件不同，出现了下列数种组织形式：一、农副业战勤相结合与纺织统一变工——西黄须、岚沟、清泉等村互助组织中，农业生产与所有副业（运输、作坊、纺织……）以及参战支差统一变工计工分红。这种组织的好处是，既能解决了农业与副业生产与战勤的矛盾，又能发扬老少妇女劳力，克服了劳力困难。拿群众的话来说是“点点不误都能搞好”。二、农副业战勤相结合——霍家窑、霞庄、北流等村都是采用农业一般副业（不包括纺织）与战勤相结合的办法，这种形式最普遍，与前种不同的是纺织没有组织到里边（纺织自行组织，但妇女参加农副业生产同样可以变工）。三、农副业相结合——岩头岭、五十亩等村采用农业与副业互助变工生产办法，它不与战勤相结合，此种形式为数不多。四、土地合作社——北社旧寿松今年创造一种土地合作社，全组（六户）农业生产，土地按产量入股（资金股），劳力按活计工入股（劳力股）。副业生产，牲口大车作价入股（资金股），劳力按工入股（劳力股），集体经营，生产费用集体负责。农副业分头分红，农业红利资金股分百分之二十五，劳力股分百分之七十，拿百分之五作奖励生产积极分子，副业红利，资金股分百分之七十，劳力股分百分之二十五，拿百分之五作奖励生产积极分子、劳力股农副业统一来分，这种办法正实验中。
    二、三大结合
    根据今年大生产运动新的情况与新的要求，领导上对今年互助组织上的基本指导方针是：普遍推行以农为主与副业战勤相结合的互助组织，为此应实行统一变工计工分红，严格等价政策，统一工资，注意剩余劳力应得利润与扩大互助范围。兹将互助组织中三大结合的具体执行情形分别研究如下：
    甲、以农为主的生产指导思想，应贯彻到互助组织中：农副业生产在具体组织进行中，有两种办法：一种是根据全组或全队劳畜力、土地、处境等条件，通过精确计算抽出农业生产中剩余劳力长年进行副业生产，比如霍家窑、西仵、仁庄等村的运输队，霞庄、北流、西黄须、西井等村的油坊、弹花、轧花、纺绳等，或在农时间来组织剩余劳畜力搞临时副业生产，如岚沟刨药产王家庄砍山货以及临时组织运输等，总之将农业生产中所有的剩余劳畜力在不违农事原则下全部组织到副业生产中。另一种是在“重副轻农”思想支持下，觉得“修边垒揠不合算，积极劳动（指搞副业）就能干”，认为种地是捎带，将大量劳畜力投着副业生产中，往往在农业生产紧张关头，他偏要去扑大脚钱，致使农业生产受到影响。前一种是以农为主来结合副业，后一种则是违犯这种原则，必然会使粮食、棉花产量降低，直接影响军需民食，我们肯定认识。很好组织副业生产是对的，但互助组织必须在以农为主深耕细作提高技术原则下，通过精确计算，抽出剩余劳力，组织长期的或临时的副业生产，因此我们推广了前一种作法，纠正了后一种偏差。
    乙、统一使用劳畜力：为了有计划的去组织农副业各项生产活动与服战争勤务，我们将组织起的劳畜力统一使用，基本使用单位是互助组，它可以根据生活缓急与劳畜力条件统一支配，必要时可以队或村来调剂，比如霞庄王金明队有两个人两条骡子专运输，三个人专搞油房，其余人种地服战勤。在一个具体生产活动中，亦要统一具体分工，比如担水栽棉中，石板杨拴大队有两个老汉专犁地，三个老汉专刨圪道（技术好），其余三个老汉，七个大儿童跌籽上水上肥埋圪道，三个青壮年挑水，十九个青壮年担水，栽了一块栽一块，这样便于突击完成一个紧急工作，且领导上也便于掌握计划，又能发挥各个人的能力。
    丙、统一按活计工互助变工：在进行各项生产与战勤任务上统一以标准劳力（一般劳力），农业生产工分（十分）为标准。根据效率与技术程度实行按活计工，死分活计，个人与组织发生关系，各种工均可互相变，根据实入工与实用工算账。农副业结合计工办法西黄须是：农业工根据具体生活临时确定标准生活标准工分。运输牲口每载重百斤往返六十里作十分（回脚同样作分），参加运输的人，每日亦作十分，但为发扬其积极性起见，每日奖两分共为十二分（管吃）。副业生产资金每月一万元作三个工（三十分），此外与纺织结合计工办法是：厂外纺织是纺一斤头等线计十一分，纺一斤二等线计十分；织一斤头等布计十分，织斤四两二等布计十分；厂内浆线三斤计一分，抖线二斤计三分，经线一斤计一分，过柱铮一机计六分，打络子一斤计一分，织二尺头等布计一分，织二尺半二等布计一分，织毛巾两条计一分，排铮一付计六分，入全机一架月作两个半工（二十五分），入空机一架月作一个工（十分）。战勤与生产相结合计工办法：霞庄是参战人每日计十分，表现好的每日奖两分，支当日差人与种地同，两天者人每日计十一分，三大以上者人每日计十二分。牲口每日载重百斤计十分，辅助劳力帮送信、站岗与其参加农业生产固定工分同。霍家窑参战人每日计十分，如果在前线立了功每日计十一分，经验证明，对服战勤人畜生活上加以照顾是应该的，因此参战人吃了公家，在家不扣食粮是对的。在前线立了功奖工分能激发其参战情绪，支差人畜较种地多顶点工分，以补偿其在外多消耗，拨派战勤上基本还是轮流结合调剂较好，为便利拨派，互助组内可设抗勤组长。由于在农副业生产与战勤上普遍实行了按活计工与统一变工，所有半劳力与辅助劳力大都组织到互助组织中，各尽其力各得其分，这样不仅克服了当前劳力困难，且使无劳力人的生产困难得以解决。
    丁、统一分红：组织起来抽出剩余劳力去搞副业生产，所得红利除去消耗与搞副业工资而外，留下来的纯红利分法有三种类型：西仵抽百分之五奖励积极分子，百分之五奖剩余劳力外，百分之九十，以全组劳力来分；西井是抽百分之十奖励积极分子外，其余全由剩余劳力来分；岚沟是百分之五奖励积极分子，百分之二十由资金来分，百分之十奖全组劳力，百分之六十五由剩余劳力来分（均事先奖励了搞事业力）。根据全县以上三种主要分红类型来研究，西仵将绝大部分副业红利分予全组劳力，过分强调副业生产是组织起来的结果，忽视了实际参加副业生产的是剩余劳力是不妥当的，应改进（互助生产提高效率挤出工来也算）。西井完全否定一般劳力，全给剩余劳力分，也不妥当，应适当照顾一般劳力。岚沟是掌握了剩余劳力多分，同时也照顾了全组劳力的互助生产情绪，这种分法可大大提倡。由此我们应肯定认识，副业生产红利大部应由剩余劳力来分，但为了很好互助生产，亦应抽出一部，奖励生产中积极分子与全组劳力。同时搞副业劳力，亦须有一定奖励，但出外开支实支实报容易浪费，不如固定数目合适，正确执行四层分红。
    戊、统一工资正确掌握工资水平：为了生产战勤在全村范围内互助变工，我们采取了统一的死工资制，因为工资不统一则无法变工，但今年工资水平较高，一般在十斤米左右，如果算个账，种地实用工资高于实收粮，所以说工资本来不应有这样高，而是在劳力缺乏情况下一种不正常现象，由此影响到互助组搞运输赔钱（脚粮价上涨脚价相对降低运输赚工资高），致使农副业难结合进行。由于工资高对群众思想是震动，产生劳力恐慌心里，不敢在深耕细作上多用工，有肥也不上边堰也不修，不想种棉花等费工作物，想多种简单的豆类庄稼，甚至在“不是地养人而是人养地”思想支持下不想种地，因此我们用算账方法说服群众降低工资到七、八斤米。在掌握工资水平问题上，必须具有阶级观点。今年由于土地分散，互助生产基本上是农民间的事情，而且基本上是工对工（特别是孤寡户），工资是用于工对工之外用以清理账目，因此如果过高，对农业生产上没有什么好处，同时也影响到对副业生产的积极组织（互助组没有利），结果会直接影响到互助运动的巩固与发展；但对一些富裕户土地较多劳力不足者，在其劳力不足部分，或企图钻空者，我们采取了按市价包工的办法，这样即可将剩余劳力吸收到农业生产中来。
    三、新的组织机构与新的领导方法
    根据今年互助生产运动发展中新的要求与一元化领导在村贯彻的结果，各村生产组织机构与领导方法均有所改进，一般村由各系统主要干部、劳动英雄们互助队长等参加组成生产委员会，这个组织是全村生产工作的最高领导集团，其任务是研究总结全村生产工作具体组织进行，以生产为中心，结合其他各种工作，统一计划，予以适当安排，各干部均以生产工作为中心任务，统一领导分头进行。比如仁庄生产委员会对谷雨节十天工作的确定，是以运完肥、整好棉田、锄完麦为中心，在互助组中从讨论时事入手，进行生产动员与准备，进一步讨论在生产参战中如何立功。工作确定后，各个干部分到各个大队通过积极分子将工作做起来，每日经过个别接头发现模范及时表扬，逢三六九干部学习即可把工作谈一下，有可推广材料马上组织通讯，使学习工作通讯结成一起，十天头上再开生产委员会检查总结再行布置，一切工作通过生产会议统一研究统一安排，克服了各来一套互相扯皮毛病。生产委员会设主任、农业股、副业股、宣传表扬股、纺织股等，互助组除互助组长外，各种工作均有专人负责，比如北流互助组设互助、学习、技术、练武、战勤、治安等组长；清泉互助队设正副队长、优抗委员、练武班长、计工员、纺织委员、农业技术委员、运输组长等。这种互助组织，实际上成了以生产工作为主的各种工作结合的统一组织形式，它不仅只限于组织进行生产，实际上是各项工作最下层的组织基础。事实证明：一切工作与生产工作生产组织脱节，则很难行通，由此更加明确了系统工作必须为中心工作——生产工作服务，通过中心工作来建设系统工作，也只有这样才能集中力量开展生产运动。
