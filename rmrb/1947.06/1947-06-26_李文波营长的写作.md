　　Battalion Commander Li Wenbo's Writing
　　Rotterdam

　　Recently, I had the opportunity to stay in the Third Battalion of the Mengzi Troops for a period, and had many contacts with Battalion Commander Li Wenbo, with a wide range of conversations. Because I liked some of his works, our conversation also touched on the question of how he started writing.

　　Comrade Li Wenbo revealed his northern temperament with boldness, unreservedly talking about his background. Because his father was addicted to opium and did not engage in proper work, he squandered a family fortune. He suffered all kinds of hardships from an early age. He worked as a carpenter's apprentice, a gambler's follower, begged for food, opened a restaurant, and was conscripted, etc.; once he was even betrayed by his father, and only managed to be redeemed under the protection of his aunt. When he parted from his father, he was stabbed with scissors, leaving two scars on his waist to this day. He attended school for two years from the age of nine to ten, which was his entire education.

　　After joining the revolution, he worked in the propaganda team for a long time, writing and performing plays, composing and singing songs. He was once enthusiastic about writing, and corresponded extensively with Comrade Wang Chun, seeking the secrets of writing. Comrade Wang Chun also tried his best to help him, painstakingly explaining new-style punctuation in his letters, etc., but he was unable to publish a single article.

　　Later, he switched to political work, serving as an instructor for several years. He only became a military commander when the Patriotic Self-Defense War began. After becoming an instructor, he was too busy to write, and lacked confidence, so he severed ties with writing. However, having worked in propaganda and education for many years, although he had not laid a foundation or made a name for himself in writing, he had developed a set of skills in describing events and portraying characters orally. Listening to him talk was truly fascinating. When many comrades engaged in propaganda and education work went to him to collect interview materials, they were simply captivated by his narration. People like Wang Ruo, the Propaganda Section Chief of the Brigade, Zhang Fasheng, the Organization Officer, and Li Shuangquan, the Instructor of the First Battalion, often urged him to write himself. After several urges, after the Juan'nan Campaign, he mustered up the courage to submit his first short piece praising battlefield discipline, "The Eighth Route Army Soldiers are Strong and Kind." It was only forty or fifty words long, but after it was published in the regimental "Battlefield" newspaper and the brigade's "Meritorious Service" newspaper, it had a significant effect. Many comrades, after seeing it, said, "Wang Tutang has this one good point, the battalion commander writes a manuscript and reports it. Let's also pay more attention to battlefield discipline, and earn merit to be reported!" Later, the War Comrade Newspaper also reprinted this manuscript, and wrote a letter encouraging him to continue writing. In particular, the impact of this manuscript within the troops made him value this work and determined to take the time to write.

　　Perhaps some people would find it strange why he couldn't write when he wanted to engage in writing, asked for advice, and pursued techniques, but now simply recording one simple thing out of thousands of things turned out to be a good thing, welcomed by people. However, Comrade Li Wenbo did not look for answers related to writing from here, but discovered the role that newspaper work and communication work played in the troops, and thus launched the "Earn Merit and Report" campaign in the battalion. He also actively wrote himself, successively producing "Sights Under the City," "Blood on the Sleeve," "Shi Ming's Transformation," "The Third Battalion in the Battle of Wanglou," "Medic Zhu Tongyi," "Review on the Front Line," etc., all of which were very popular with readers, and played a great role in the troops.

　　In addition to writing himself, he also actively cultivated many correspondents to write together. He personally reviewed and revised most of the correspondents' manuscripts. Once, Wang Tiande and others compiled a quick-patter rhyme "Singing Praises of Hero Zhang Fazhen," which quickly spread after he revised it. Soldier Pan Liansan said, "This must have been compiled by the battalion commander again. If I don't earn merit and have him compile a song for me, it won't count!"

　　Under such a "Earn Merit and Report" campaign, the good became even better after being praised, and the bad also improved. For example, after "Quick-Patter Criticism of Zhang Huobao" was published, Comrade Zhang Shuanglan (Huobao) gradually improved. "Shi Ming's Transformation" is still kept in Shi Ming's own pocket. Whenever he thinks of discipline, he immediately remembers it. Recently, Shi Ming's father came and was touched to see his child become so good, saying, "My child has been very naughty since he was young, but the battalion commander has taught him well."

　　The Seventh Company's broadcast bulletins were also launched under this campaign. Now, the door bulletin boards and blackboard bulletins of each company are also developed on this basis. Among the battalion's thirty-seven correspondents, many are already excellent writers. In the process of writing, a collective writing method like Wang Tiande's group has emerged. Wang Tiande himself can't write, but he has a high talent for oral composition. He and a bugler, a soldier named Chen Xianmo, collaborated on writing. The bugler first went to collect materials, Chen then went to investigate, and then the three discussed and gave opinions together. Wang Tiande composed orally, and the bugler took notes. The quick-patter rhymes they compiled, such as "Singing Praises of Hero Zhang Fazhen," are already very popular works.

　　Undoubtedly, Comrade Li Wenbo used his own writing to influence and promote the writing of the entire battalion, and used his own emphasis on this work to influence and promote the entire battalion's emphasis on this work. Moreover, communication and reporting work has become an important assistant to the political work of the troops, improving work and transforming people. The vivid examples during this period are truly countless.

　　Deputy Commander Teng said, "We should commend and learn from the spirit of Battalion Commander Li Wenbo's writing." He received this praise without any guilt.

　　Many of his works under the theme of "Literature and Art for the Soldiers" are very solid, rich, and vivid. Professional literary and artistic workers can't match his understanding of the soldiers, because he is first and foremost a battalion commander, thinking wholeheartedly about how to lead the soldiers and how to fight. He writes because he is "forced" and "squeezed" out. He writes because his works have a good effect on the troops, not because they can be published everywhere. He also has many works that have not been published.

　　From the perspective of a reader, I naturally cherish his works for adding honor and achievement to literature and art, but I cherish even more his and the Third Battalion's soldiers' combat achievements in the nearly one-year Patriotic Self-Defense War. Without his own and the Third Battalion soldiers' combat achievements, there would be no these works. Ba Wu'erzhang, Mo Meishi, and Captain Ulei (the protagonist in the book "Fear and Courage") said, "In the war, I read a book. This book was not written with ink, nor was it written with a pencil, but with blood." Precisely because the soldiers wrote it out with blood, we can then copy a little bit down and print it on paper. And what makes Battalion Commander Li Wenbo worthy of "commendation and learning" is that he does not rely on others, but takes the initiative to write himself, writing a lot, writing very well, that kind of "spirit of writing."

　　Comrade Li Wenbo, as a battalion commander and combatant, is also a model correspondent and an excellent literary and artistic worker, which can only appear in the people's army, because every member of this army is constantly thinking about how to serve the people more and better, and be a meritorious servant of the people. Our troops are invincible, our literary and artistic field is broad, and the future is unlimited!

　　I wish Battalion Commander Li Wenbo more great victories, and then also blossom his flourishing flowers in the literary and artistic garden.

### 李文波营长的写作

　　李文波营长的写作
    鹿特丹
    最近有一个机会去孟字部队三营住了一个时期，和李文波营长有很多接触，谈话的范围很广。因为喜欢他的一些作品，我们的谈话也就谈到过他怎么搞起写作这么一个问题。
    李文波同志豪迈地表露了他北方人的气质，一点不掩饰地从他的身世谈起。因为他父亲的吸料子，不务正，把一份家业搞光了。他从小就受尽了各种苦处。当过木工学徒，赌徒的跟班，讨过饭，开过饭铺，被抓过差等等；还有一次被他父亲出卖过，只在姑母的保护下才得以赎回来，临到和他父亲分别时，还被他父亲扎了一剪刀，至今腰上留着两个疤痕。从九岁到十岁上过两年学，算是他的全部文化程度。
    参加革命以后，他有很长一段时间是在宣传队工作，编戏、演戏、编歌、唱歌，曾经对写作热心过，和王春同志通过很多信，追求写作的诀窍，王春同志也曾尽力帮助过他，曾不惮烦劳地在信上给他讲解新式标点等等，可是他没有能够发表一篇文章。
    以后他改行干政治工作，当了几年的指导员，爱国自卫战争开始，他才成为军事指挥员的。从当指导员以后，工作忙的顾不上写作，自己又没有信心，也就和写作绝缘了。但他究竟干宣教工作多年，写作上虽然没有奠下基础，弄出个名堂，描述事件和刻画人物的口才却有了一套，听他谈起话来，真是津津有味，部队的生活又是丰富而生动的，许多搞宣教工作的同志去他那里搜集访问材料的时候，简直都被他的叙述迷住了。如旅的宣教科长王若同志，组织干事张法生同志，一营指导员李双全同志等就时常怂恿他自己动手来写，经过几次督促，在鄄南战役以后，他鼓起勇气投出了第一篇表扬战场纪律的小稿子，《八路军人强心好》。仅仅四五十个字，但在团的《战地》报，旅的《立功》报上登出来以后，起的作用却很大，很多同志看到以后，都说“王土棠有这一点好处，营长就给他写稿上报，咱们也多多注意战场纪律，立个功好上报呀！”后来战友报又转载了这篇稿子，并来信鼓励他继续写作。特别是这篇稿子在部队里面起的影响，使得他重视了这一工作，决心要抽空来写了。
    也许有人会奇怪，为什么他从前想搞写作，向人请教，追求技巧，却写作不出来，现在只是把千百件事情中的一件简单记录下来，反而是好东西，受人欢迎。但李文波同志丝毫没有从这里去找寻属于写作上的答案，却从它发现出了报纸工作，通讯工作对部队所起的作用，于是在营里掀起了“立功上报”运动。自己也积极写起来，先后有《城下见闻》，《袄袖上的血》，《石明三转变》，《王楼战斗中的第三营》，《卫生员朱同义》，《前沿上回顾》等等，都是很受读者欢迎，而在部队中又起了很大作用的稿了。
    除开自己写作以外，他又积极培养了好多通讯员共同来写，通讯员的稿子，他大半是亲自看过、改过的。有一次王天德等编了一个“歌唱英雄张发珍”的快板，经他修改一下登出来，很快就流传开了，战士潘连三就说：“这一定又是营长编的，俺要不立个功叫他给俺也编一个唱唱，就不算！”
    在这样一个“立功上报”的运动下面，好的经表扬以后更好了，不好的也改好了，如像“快板批评张活宝”，登出来以后，张双兰（活宝）同志就逐渐改好了，“石明三的转变”现在还放在石明三自己的口袋里，啥时候他一想起纪律，立刻就记起了它，最近石明三的父亲来了，见他孩子变得这样好，也感动地说：“俺孩从小就顽皮的很，可叫营长管教好了。”
    七连的播功报，也是在这个运动下搞起来的，现在各连队的门板报，黑板报也是在这个基础上发展起来的，全营卅七个通讯员，很多已经是优秀的写稿者。在写稿当中，又出现了像王天德组的集体写作的方式。王天德本人并不会写，但他口编的才能很高，他和一个司号员，一个叫陈贤模的战士，三个人合作写稿，由司号员先去搜集材料，陈再去调查，然后三个人共同讨论，提意见，王天德口编，司号员执笔纪录。他们编的快板如“歌唱英雄张发珍”等，已是很流行的作品了。
    无疑地，李文波同志以他自己的写作，影响并推动了全营的写作，以他自己对这个工作的重视，影响并推动了全营对这工作的重视，而且通讯报导工作成了部队政治工作的重要助手，改进了工作也改造了人，这期间生动的例子真是不胜枚举。
    滕副司令员说：“我们应该表扬和学习营长李文波同志写作的精神。”他得到这个赞语是毫无愧色的。
    他的许多作品在文艺为兵这一个题目下，是很结实、丰富、生动的。对于兵的了解，职业的文艺工作者没有一个赶得上他，因为他首先是营长，全心全力想到的是如何带领战士和如何打仗。他写作，是被“逼”着，“挤”出来的，他果然写了，但不是为的在文坛上去出名，促进他一发而不可收的写作，显然是因作品对部队起了好的作用，而不是由于到处可以发表，他也有好多作品没有被发表出来。
    从一个读者来说，我自然珍贵他的作品给文艺增添了荣誉和成绩，但我更珍贵的是他和他全营的战士们，在近一年的爱国自卫战争中的战斗业迹。没有他自己和三营战士们的战斗业迹，就没有他这些作品。巴武尔章、莫梅什、乌雷上尉（恐惧与无畏书中主人公）说：“在战争中，我读到过一本书，这本书不是用墨水写的，也不是用铅笔写的，而是用血写的。”正因为战士们用血写了出来，我们才可能再誊一点点下来，印在纸片上。而李文波营长之所以值得“表扬和学习”的，乃是他并不假手于人，却自己动手来写，写得很多，写得很好的那一种“写作的精神”。
    作为一个营长，也是战斗员的李文波同志，同时又是模范通讯员，优秀的文艺工作者，只有在人民的军队里才可能出现，因为这个军队的每个成员时时刻刻在想着怎样才能更多为人民服务，更好为人民服务，当人民的功臣。我们的部队是无敌的，我们的文艺领域是广阔的，前途无限！
    预祝李文波营打更多的大胜仗，然后在文艺苑囿内也开出他繁盛的花朵。
