　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 6th -- TASS, New York: An American news magazine recently published an article pointing out that unemployment is increasing across the United States. According to the lowest estimates, there are approximately 400,000 unemployed people in New York. Unemployment is also increasing in New England, the South Atlantic states, California, and other regions. The magazine predicts that the number of unemployed will increase to around seven million by early next year. By next spring, employment in the manufacturing industry will decrease by approximately two million, in the construction industry by approximately 200,000, in the transportation industry by approximately 500,000, in the trade sector by approximately 800,000, in the financial sector by approximately 250,000, and among government employees by approximately 400,000. Currently, unemployment is particularly noticeable in the consumer goods industry. The New York Times reported that employment in the manufacturing industry in the New England states decreased by more than 31,000 from March to May 1st, with the most layoffs occurring in the textile, leather, and electrical machinery industries. The United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America published a statement in the newspaper condemning the monopoly capitalists for using increased unemployment to depress wages. They estimate that at least 50,000 people are unemployed in the electrical industry. Many industrialists and economists believe that an economic "recession" has begun in the United States. Another report: Negotiations between the United Mine Workers of America and northern coal mine owners regarding wage increases and the conclusion of collective bargaining agreements have stalled due to the owners' disregard for the workers' demands. The United Mine Workers of America plans to have all miners leave the mines for ten days, from June 27th to July 7th. Subsequently, if no agreement is reached, Lewis (note: President of the United Mine Workers of America) can extend the time away from the mines under the slogan "No contract, no work."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 3rd -- Washington: Fifty-two Democratic members of Congress submitted a written opinion to the Joint Economic Committee of both houses of Congress on May 29th, requesting immediate consideration of the Economic Stabilization Committee's recent report on the threat of an economic crisis. The opinion stated that the current severe economic crisis would not only bring disaster to the United States but also "potentially damage our position in the world."

　　美国经济已在开始衰退
    纽约失业者达四十万
    估计明春全国将有七百万人失业
    【新华社陕北六日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国新闻杂志顷发表文章，指出美国各地失业开始增加。据最低估计，现在纽约失业者为数约达四十万。新英格兰、南部大西洋沿岸各州、加利福尼亚及其他地方，失业都在增加。该杂志预测，明年初失业人数将增至七百万左右。明年春季制造工业，就业人数将减少二百万左右，建筑工业二十万左右，运输业五十万左右，贸易部门八十万左右，金融业等二十五万左右，政府雇员四十万左右。目前消费商品工业中的失业特别显著。纽约时报报导：新英格兰各州制造工业就业人数自三月至五月一日减少三万一千以上，纺织及皮革和电气机械各工业中的解雇人数最多。无线电与电气机械工人联合职工会在报上发表声明，谴责垄断资本家借增加失业来压低工资。他们估计电机工业中至少有五万人失业。许多工业家和经济学家都很相信经济“衰退”已在美国开始。又讯：美国矿工联合会与北部煤矿厂主关于增加工资及缔结集体合同之谈判由于厂主漠视工人之要求，已陷入僵局而停顿下来。矿工联合会计划自六月二十七日至七月七日止，令所有的矿工离开矿场十天。嗣后假如还未达协议，则路易斯（按：矿工联合会主席）可以在“无合同不工作”的口号下，延长离开矿场之时日。
    【新华社陕北三日电】华盛顿讯：美民主党议员五十二人于五月二十九日向国会两院联合经济委员会提出意见书，要求立即考虑经济稳定委员会最近关于经济危机威胁之报告。该意见书中称：目前严重之经济危机不仅将使美国遭致灾害，并且“可能有损于我们在全世界的地位”。
