Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th: In the battle to recapture Changtu, the Northeast Democratic Allied Army killed, wounded, and captured over 4,400 enemy soldiers. Preliminary statistics of the battle results are as follows: over 400 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and 4,052 enemy soldiers were captured, including Zou Lin, deputy commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, and Deng Heling, lieutenant colonel and deputy regimental commander of the cavalry. The following were seized: 13 mortars, 27 60mm mortars, 10 rocket launchers, 2,187 rifles and carbines, 135 light machine guns, 32 heavy machine guns, 24 submachine guns, 30 telephones, 2 binoculars, over 410 war horses, over 520,000 rounds of ammunition, over 300 artillery shells, and a portion of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 5th: Zou Lin, the captured deputy commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army of the Chiang army, said in the Changtu battle: Last month (May), I went to Nanjing for two weeks of training. Chiang Kai-shek listed the reasons why the Chiang army had repeatedly lost battles in various places: dispersing forces to guard various points, lines, towns, and cities, with insufficient troops, thus being defeated and annihilated one by one. Chiang Kai-shek said angrily: "If we do not earnestly correct this in the future, it will be very dangerous." His solution was: "Shorten the points and lines, so that there are enough troops to guard key points and control mobile forces, which is a good strategy." Zou pointed out: "We still suffered annihilation when we adopted his new tactics this time!" Zou also revealed that Han Zengdong, commander of the 88th Division of the army, was killed in the Battle of Huai'de.

　　怀德昌图两次战斗
    我毙俘敌正副师长
    【新华社东北前线四日电】东北民主联军收复昌图战斗中，毙伤俘敌四千四百余名。战果初步统计如下：毙伤敌官兵四百余名，俘敌七十一军九十一师副师长邹麟、骑兵中校副团长邓鹤龄以下官兵四千零五十二名。缴获迫击炮十三门，六零炮二十七门，火箭炮十门，长短枪二千一百八十七支，轻机枪一百三十五挺，重机枪三十二挺，冲锋机枪二十四挺，电话机三十部，望远镜二个，战马四百一十余匹，子弹五十二万余发，炮弹三百余发，其他军用品一部。
    【新华社东北前线五日电】昌图战斗中被俘之蒋军七十一军九十一师副师长邹麟谈称：上月（五月）我曾去南京受训两星期，蒋介石曾列举各地蒋军屡战屡败的原因为：分兵把守各点线城镇，兵力不足，因此遭各个击破与歼灭。蒋介石曾激愤的说：“如果今后不切实加以改正，非常危险。”而他的挽救办法，则是：“缩短点线，使有足够兵力扼守要点，并掌握机动兵力，是为善策。”邹氏于此指陈：“我们这次采取他的新战术时，还是遭到歼灭！”邹氏并透露该军八十八师师长韩增栋于怀德战役中被击毙。
