　　Taiyue Captures Xiangling and Hongdong
    Linfen Surrounded by Our Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Taiyue Front, Urgent Telegram, 5th] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, having captured Fencheng, marched north, heading straight for Xiangling City, an outer stronghold of Linfen. They captured the city at 7:00 AM on the 4th, annihilating all the defending enemy. The results of the battle are currently being tallied. Note: Xiangling is the 22nd county seat liberated in our offensive operations, only thirty li from Linfen, and an important stronghold guarding Linfen.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Taiyue Front, Urgent Telegram, 5th] The People's Liberation Army captured Hongdong City, a cotton and wheat producing area in southern Shanxi, on the evening of the 4th. The defending enemy, the 89th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the Chiang Army, fled in disarray. This city was the only remaining strong outer stronghold of the Linfen Chiang Army. The People's Liberation Army destroyed it within twelve hours of recovering Xiangling. The two major liberated areas of Taiyue and Luliang are now connected on a railway line stretching over 300 li from Ling Shinan Pass in the north to Xinjiang County in the south. The Linfen Chiang Army is now trapped within a powerful encirclement by the military and civilians of the two regions. Note: Hongdong is the 23rd county seat captured in our southern Shanxi offensive. The city was liberated on August 16th of last year and occupied by the Chiang-Hu army on October 6th. This is the second time it has been recovered.

　　太岳攻克襄陵洪洞
    临汾已被我军包围
    【新华社太岳前线五日急电】攻克汾城之人民解放军某部挥戈北上，直取临汾外围据点襄陵城，于四日七时当将该城攻克，守敌全部就歼。战果正清查中。按：襄陵为我攻势作战中解放之第二十二座县城，仅距临汾三十里，为拱卫临汾之重要据点。
    【新华社太岳前线五日急电】人民解放军于四日晚攻克晋南棉麦产区洪洞城，守敌蒋军三十旅八十九团狼狈溃窜。该城为临汾蒋军仅存之唯一强固外围据点，人民解放军收复襄陵后十二小时内即将其摧毁。太岳、吕梁两大解放区，在北起灵石南关，南至新绛县城，三百余华里铁路线上连成一片，现临汾蒋军陷于两区强大军民包围圈内。按：洪洞为我晋南攻势作战中攻占之第二十三座县城。该城于去年八月十六日曾被解放，十月六日被蒋胡军侵占，此为第二次收复。
