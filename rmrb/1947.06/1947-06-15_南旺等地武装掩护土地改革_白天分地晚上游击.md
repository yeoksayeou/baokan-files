　　【Report from Ji-Lu-Yu, 11th】 Local armed forces, militia, and work teams in our Ji (Ning) Ji (Bei) Nan (Wang) guerrilla areas are actively covering the masses' distribution of land and property. On the afternoon of the 18th of last month, while fighting was taking place six li from Zhangshan Village in Jibei, the villagers confiscated all the property of Zhang Wenye, the puppet township chief of Chiang Kai-shek, and Zhang Decheng, a fleeing landlord, and quickly distributed it. At the same time, a land distribution committee was established to register land, divide land distribution groups, and carry out land distribution. In order to effectively cover the masses' land distribution, the Jinan First Work Team launched active operations. On the evening of May 1st, a section of the team went to Bali Temple and completely destroyed the enemy's telephone line, which was more than ten li long, and burned down a wooden bridge. Another work team inserted itself into Dazhendian to hold mass meetings, conducting activities all night. On the 2nd, they helped the masses in Dawangji to distribute land and grain, distributing 2,000 catties of grain and all the clothes and furniture of the landlords to the peasants. On the 4th, they distributed 9,000 catties of grain in two villages and brought the landlords under control. The next day, before dawn, our local armed forces ambushed the villages surrounding the enemy strongholds. Seven members of the work team divided into two groups and, within six hours in two villages, distributed more than 6,000 catties of grain, and all 120-odd pieces of furniture and clothing, as well as a donkey and an ox, belonging to two landlord families, to the peasants. They also elected representatives to assess and distribute the land. The first district of Nanwang adopted the method of distributing land during the day and conducting guerrilla warfare at night, determined to fight through 35 villages within ten days, to ensure the elimination of the poorest peasants, make military dependents prosperous middle peasants, and increase the number of farm association members to more than 50% of all peasants, and establish women's organizations. In order to complete this task, it was decided to make extensive use of activists to promote the land distribution committees in various villages, to control the landlords from top to bottom, and to effectively support the masses. In villages close to Yuncheng, militiamen were deployed to the border to carry out activities, distributing land during the day and conducting guerrilla warfare at night.
