Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. According to the Central News Agency: Guangxi, Guangdong, Taiwan and other provinces have suffered severe floods due to the long-term disrepair of dykes and the corruption and dereliction of duty by the Chiang government's water conservancy authorities. After months of heavy rain in southwestern Guangxi, rivers in various counties along the river have flooded, wiping out crops; 51 counties have been flooded, creating the worst flood in 30 years. Nanning city is several feet deep in water, with boats sailing on land; Wuming County alone has 60,000 victims. In Guangdong, the dykes in various counties along the East, West, North, and Han Rivers have mostly collapsed, causing floods, turning fields and houses into swamps. In a town southwest of Sanshui, the water level is ten feet high, and in Shilong, the water level reaches the eaves. Huizhou, Zengcheng, Dongguan and other counties along the East River have been the hardest hit, with estimated losses of more than 20 billion yuan. Currently, the province is full of displaced people, with 500,000 people homeless. In Taiwan, heavy rains have been continuous throughout the province for nearly a month. In Taichung County, the revetment dykes of various rivers have breached in nine places, with a total length of more than 3,000 meters. The early rice in the county is currently being harvested, and most of the paddy fields have been flooded. The Houlong River in Zhuxian County has also breached, destroying most of the crops. The Bagang revetment in Tainan County and the revetment in Kaohsiung County are also in critical condition. The north-south railway running through the province has been cut into two sections, and all freight transport has been suspended. The railway bridges over the Dadu River between Taichung and Changhua and the Mugua River in the east have also been washed away and cannot be used for traffic. More than 10,000 cubic meters of soil have collapsed in the mountains between Hualien and Suao, and traffic has been cut off.
