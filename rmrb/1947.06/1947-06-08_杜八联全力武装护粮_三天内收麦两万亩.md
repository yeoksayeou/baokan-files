　　Du Ba Township Fully Armed to Protect Grain
    20,000 Mu of Wheat Harvested in Three Days
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 6th dispatch] The masses of Du Ba Township, in the tense battle to protect the wheat harvest with "a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other," harvested 20,000 mu of wheat in three days. Ninety percent of the wheat, both large and small, has been brought to the threshing ground. The rush harvest has come to an end, and the villages are now busy threshing. This year's wheat harvest has two characteristics: (1) Cadres take the lead and organization is extensive. In Mazhu Village, under the leadership of Li Yinglin, chairman of the old peasant association, everyone participated. The entire male workforce was responsible for carrying and bundling wheat, the entire female workforce for cutting and loading wheat, the semi-labor force for gleaning, and the elderly women for cooking and feeding livestock. Therefore, this year's wheat harvest was exceptionally rapid, with 1,400 mu harvested in three days. (2) One hand holds a gun and the other a sickle; fighting in the front, harvesting in the rear. The militia actively launched offensives during this period. Starting from the 23rd, there were battles every day. On the 24th, an intelligence agent from the puppet Wei An Sheng Department was captured alive. On the 25th, four enemies were killed or wounded. On the 26th, a team of water militia attacked the lower reaches of the Yellow River, killing and capturing ten members of the puppet Self-Defense Corps. On the morning of the 27th, more than 200 enemies attempted to cut off the militia's return route but were repelled by our joint defense militia, who killed or wounded ten enemies. In four days, a total of 52 enemies were killed or captured, with no casualties on our side.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 5th dispatch] The Wangwu wheat harvest campaign has entered its climax, with nine-tenths of the wheat in the areas bordering the enemy already harvested. The border areas of the Second District are only five li away from the city of Yuanqu, and all 24 villages in the district have universally organized rush harvest mutual aid teams. Villages along the Yellow River, such as Ruicun, Yaotou, and Xiasou, started as early as the 18th of last month. Wangjiashan, Fenjiagou and other places also began rush harvesting on the 23rd of last month and are nearing completion. The mutual aid teams in Ruicun and Wangjiashan have scientifically divided the work, with the militia carrying guns and sickles to rush harvest in the front, and the semi-labor force protecting the rush harvest in the rear. The militia rotation teams on Xiyuan Mountain are divided into two teams of 40 people each. In addition to monitoring the enemy, each team must cut at least 200 mu per day.

　　杜八联全力武装护粮
    三天内收麦两万亩
    【本报太岳六日电】杜八联群众在“一手拿枪、一手拿镰”紧张的保卫麦收战斗中，三天内收麦两万亩，大小麦百分之九十均已登场。抢收已告一段落，各村现正紧张打场。今年麦收有两个特点：（一）干部带头，组织广泛。马住村在老农会主席李盈林率领下人人动手，男全劳力负责担麦捆麦，女全劳力割麦装麦，半劳力拾麦，老婆做饭喂牲口，因此今年麦收异常迅速，三天收麦一千四百亩。（二）一手拿枪一手拿镰，前边打后边收。民兵在此时期积极展开攻势，从二十三号开始，每天都在战斗，二十四日活捉伪卫安生部情报员一名，廿五日毙伤敌四名，廿六日水上民兵一队袭击黄河下流，毙俘伪自卫团十名，廿七日早晨敌二百余企图截断民兵归路，又被我联防民兵击退，毙伤敌十名。四天共毙俘敌五十二名，我无伤亡。
    【本报太岳五日电】王屋麦收运动已进入高潮，接敌区已收割十分之九。二区边地距垣曲城仅五里，全区二十四个村都普遍组织了抢收互助组。黄河沿岸之芮村、窑头、下首等村，早于上月十八日开始。王家山、汾家沟等地亦于上月二十三日开始抢收，已接近完成。芮村、王家山的互助组科学分工，民兵带枪与镰在前面抢收，掩护半劳力在后面抢收。西原上的民兵轮战队分成两队，每队四十人，除监视敌人外，一个队每日最少要割二百亩。
