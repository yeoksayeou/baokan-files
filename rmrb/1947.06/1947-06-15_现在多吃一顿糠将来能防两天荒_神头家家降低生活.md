From Neiqiu: Labor hero Hou Genzang in Shentou took the lead in promoting specific calculations for every household in the village, putting food saving and wild vegetable gathering into action. After Hou Genzang led the entire village in formulating a drought prevention and famine preparedness plan, he first convened a family meeting to set his own long-term savings and preparedness plan in order to lead and influence everyone. His family, consisting of six people including a half-time hired hand, reduced their average daily grain consumption from three *sheng* to two *sheng* after specific accounting and with the agreement of the whole family. Last year, they harvested eleven large *shi* of grain, and this year they can harvest one *shi* and five *dou* of wheat, totaling twelve *shi* and five *dou*. However, based on past living standards, they need ten *shi* and eight *dou* of grain for the whole year. After consumption, they only have one *shi* and three *dou* left. Adding the three *shi* and two *dou* of grain needed for work and cattle herding wages, they are still short two *shi*. Their cooperative share of 40,000 yuan can earn 40,000 yuan in dividends, which, at the current price of 1,500 yuan per *dou* of grain, can buy two *shi* and seven *dou* of grain. Jointly raising a sow with someone else (he owns two-thirds) can earn 15,000 yuan, which can buy another *shi* of grain. Raising chickens can earn eight *dou* of grain throughout the year. Sour dates and persimmons are all made into fried flour instead of selling them, which can last for two to three months. They will weave their own cloth from self-grown cotton, and earn money from transporting oil and salt. According to these calculations, they can save another two *shi* and five *dou* of grain. By reducing their daily consumption from three *sheng* to two *sheng*, they can save three *shi* and six *dou* of grain for the whole year. Adding the remaining two *shi* and five *dou*, they have a total of six *shi* and one *dou*, which is enough to eat for more than half a year. In addition, he has four *mu* of paddy fields, which can yield three *shi* and two *dou* of autumn grain, and planted five *mu* of corn, which, if there is no rain and water is burned for irrigation, can yield two *shi*. He can't wear all the cotton from one and a half *mu*, so adding the surplus grain, it is enough for eleven *shi* and three *dou*. The yield of other dry land is not even calculated, but it already exceeds the original living standard by five *dou*. Each person must collect 60 *jin* of dried wild vegetables, and they also have five bags of oil bran. Through calculation, as long as they regularly produce, save, and prepare for disaster, plus bran fried flour, they can last for a year and a half. Under the influence and promotion of his family's specific plan, discussions and preparations are being carried out everywhere in the village's streets, teams, platoons, groups, and households. For example, Hou Shixing from the East Street Team said, "Speaking of those famine years, not to mention the common people, even the troops and the government ate persimmons, vegetables, and date pits. Eating four or five *liang* of noodles per meal and ten *liang* of rice per day, we couldn't have survived without eating vegetables, trying every possible way to save a little for the people. That year (1942), I couldn't pass the date pits after eating them. Hou Zhongxue and Hou Liuni were so hungry from not having anything in their stomachs all day that their hair fell out." Overturn-the-land hero Ning Zhen said, "That year, we were so hungry that we couldn't think of any way, and we poured out the bran from the pillows to eat." Hou Jing said, "If there was something to eat, who would sell their daughter? If my daughter had something to eat, she wouldn't have been sold to someone else?" The more they discussed, the more painful it became, and a large-scale famine grievance session formed everywhere. Through the famine grievance session, they recalled the suffering of the past. After specific accounting by each street team, platoon, group, and household, the whole village uniformly reduced the average daily grain consumption from half a *sheng* to three *he* per person, regardless of age. If it is not enough to eat, bran and vegetables are used to make up the difference. With more than 800 people in the village, they can save sixteen large *shi* per day, and 192 *shi* per year, which is enough to eat for eight months. Adding fruits, trees and wild vegetables, it is not a problem to get through a lean year. All edible things must be stored (persimmon calyxes, sour dates, pagoda tree leaves, oil bran, elm bark, etc.). Each team has formulated a wild vegetable gathering plan and issued challenges, summarizing every three days. The East Street Team collected 2,030 *jin* of wild vegetables, the West Street Team collected 1,945 *jin*, the South Street Team completed 1,125 *jin*, and the North Street Team completed 1,300 *jin*, for a total of 6,400 *jin* of wild vegetables (only women, in three days). After the summary, the East Street Team collected the most, but the West Street Team started the earliest and fired the first shot. Everyone issued challenges again, continuing to collect after the wheat harvest. Everyone's morale is very high, and they are all vying to be models in the final summary. Now, the entire village of Shentou recognizes the practical slogan, "Eating more bran now can prevent two days of famine in the future."

　　现在多吃一顿糠将来能防两天荒
    神头家家降低生活
    各街队备荒挑战
    三天采菜六千斤
    全村家家精确计算
    平均人人节粮二合
    【本报内邱讯】神头劳动英雄侯根赃带头推动全村家家具体计算，节食采菜行动起来。侯根赃领导全村订出了防旱备荒计划以后，为了带领和影响大家，首先召开了家庭会，订出了自己的长期节约备荒计划，全家带半个长工共六口人，把每天全家平均吃三升粮的生活通过具体算账和全家人同意，降低到每天吃二升。去年收粮十一大石，今年能收一石五斗麦子，共十二石五斗，但按过去生活全年须粮十石八斗。除吃只余一石三斗，再加上做活放牛工资须粮三石二斗，还差两石，合作社入股四万元，能赚四万元红利，按现在一千五百元一斗谷计，能买二石七斗粮食，与别人合喂了一口母猪（他三分之二），能赚一万五千元，又能买一石粮食，喂鸡全年能赚八斗粮，酸枣柿子都不卖弄成炒面，总计够二三个月吃不成问题。穿布自种花自织布，吃油吃盐运输赚钱，这样算起来又能余二石五斗粮食，生活每天由三升降到二升，全年能有三石六斗，加上余的二石五斗共六石一斗，足够半年吃有余。另外他还有四亩水地，能收秋粮三石二斗，点了五亩玉茭，不下雨有水烧能收二石，一亩半棉自己穿不了，加上余粮就够十一石三斗，其他旱地就不打账也超过过去原生活五斗。每口要采干野菜六十斤，还有五袋油糠。通过计算后，只要经常的生产节约准备灾荒，加上糠炒面能坚持一年半。在他的全家具体计划影响推动下，全村各街队、排、组、户到处展开了讨论酝酿，如东街队侯世兴说：“提起那年年景赖，别说老百姓，部队政府还吃柿子、菜和枣胡哩，一顿吃四五两面，一天吃十来两米，要不是吃菜那能够，千法百计想给老百姓省点。那年（四二年）我吃枣胡屙不下来。侯中学侯六妮因整天吃不到肚里东西，饿的把头发都落了。”翻身英雄宁振说：“那年饿的想不下办法，把枕头糠都倒出吃了。”侯景说：“要有啥吃谁卖闺女；俺妮子要不是没啥吃那肯卖给人家？”越酝酿越痛，到处形成了灾荒大诉苦。通过灾荒大诉苦，想起了过去受罪，经过各街队、排、组、户的具体算账，全村每口人按现在的生活大小每天平均半升粮统一降到每天三合，不够吃，糠菜取齐，全村八百余口，每天能节省十六大石，全年能省一百九十二石，足够八个月吃，加上果木野菜，过个歉年不成问题。所有能吃的东西都要储存起来，（柿萼、酸枣、胡树叶、油糠、榆皮等）各队都订出了采野菜计划，提出挑战，三天头上总结，东街队采下野菜二千零三十斤，西街队打下一千九百四十五斤，南街队完成一千一百二十五斤，北街队完成一千三百斤，共打下野菜（只是妇女，三天时间）六千四百斤。总结后东街队采的最多，但西街下手最早，又打了头炮。大家又提出挑战，麦收后继续采，大家情绪很高，都争着到最后大总结时当模范。现在神头全村都认识了“现在多吃一顿糠，将来能防两天荒”的实际口号。（内邱联合办公室、治安执笔）
