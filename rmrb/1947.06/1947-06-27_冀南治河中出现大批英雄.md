　　[This dispatch from our newspaper in Southern Hebei, dated the 25th] In the process of harnessing the river, the masses in various parts of Southern Hebei have created various methods of recognizing merit. In the fourth district of Shen County, small flags are used to record merit, with the achievements of a certain person written on the flag, which is then planted next to where they are working, thus making the masses even more motivated. Liu Hongxing, Liu Zhenhuan and other eight people organized a "Good Han Team", each with a large basket. They did not rest when others rested, and in less than an hour, the eight people completed four cubic meters of earthwork. In Xilutou, Yongzhi First District, Chang Hai, who is over fifty years old, challenged the youth by carrying two baskets of wet soil weighing hundreds of pounds. At night, he secretly went to the embankment and completed two cubic meters of earthwork in the middle of the night. In Longping, cadres helped the masses in person during the river harnessing effort, completing the four-day task in three days. County Chief Cheng carried eighteen bags of soil in one go, and did not rest even though his clothes were soaked. Cadres in the Second District stipulated that each person should carry two bags for the masses a day, and the cadres all had swollen shoulders. The liberated women also did not lag behind in the river harnessing efforts. In more than ten counties such as Zhendang, Pingxiang, and Zaoqiang, a large number of liberated women poured onto the river worksite and were largely recorded for their meritorious service. For example, Liu Cuixue of Zhendang responded first at the mobilization meeting for river harnessing: "Don't think that I have a child less than one year old, I will go too!" A large number of women signed up with her. On the river bank, Cuixue walked barefoot, rolled up her trousers, and pushed a cart of soil. The men were also inspired by her. She competed with Zhai Jiji in digging mud with large baskets. When asked if she was tired, she said, "It's better to be a little tired and strong. Those who rest at home will get consumption."

　　冀南治河中出现大批英雄
    【本报冀南二十五日电】冀南各地在治河中群众创造了各种立功办法。莘县四区利用小旗记功，在小旗上写上某某人的功绩，插到他干活的旁边，因此群众更形积极。刘洪星、刘振环等八人组织好汉队，每人一个大筐，别人歇着他们也不歇，不到一点钟，八个人就搞了四方土。永智一区西卢头常海年纪五十多岁，挑起两筐百把斤的湿土与青年竞赛，夜间又偷偷的上了堤半夜做了两方土。隆平在治河中干部亲身帮助群众干，四天任务三天就完成了。程县长一气抬了十八包土，衣服湿透了仍不歇。二区干部规定每人一天替群众抬二包，干部都把膀子压肿了。治河中的翻身妇女亦不落后，振堂、平乡、枣强十余县，大部翻身妇女涌上河工，并大批上了功劳簿。如振堂、刘翠雪在治河动员大会上，她首先响应“别看我有个不满周岁的小孩，我也要去”！大批妇女随她报名，在河岸上翠雪光着脚、挽着裤腿、推着土车，男子也被她带起来，并与翟集锦用大筐竞赛，下水挖泥，别人问她累不累？她说：“累点壮实，在家静歇着的人得痨病。”
