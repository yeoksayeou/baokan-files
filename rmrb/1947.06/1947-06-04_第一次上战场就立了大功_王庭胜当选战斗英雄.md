　　Won Great Merit in First Battle
    Wang Tingsheng Elected Combat Hero
    [This Dispatch from the Yu-Bei Front, 2nd] Comrade Wang Tingsheng, a new soldier of the Sixth Company of the Second Battalion of the Gongzi Unit, arrived at the unit on May 9th. The next day, he gladly followed the troops on their mission. He entered combat at dusk. Wang Tingsheng and his squad leader, carrying a ladder, quickly approached the moat. A bullet grazed his left arm, but he did not make a sound and closely followed the troops as they charged over the wall and advanced to the outside of the enemy's bunker. He then ran a few steps and threw a grenade into the bunker, wounding four or five enemies and capturing their weapons. After the battle, he insisted on remaining at his post instead of going to the rear to recover. He was honorably elected as a combat hero this time, and the battalion recorded a minor merit. Comrade Wang served as the chairman of the peasant association in his village and has always been an active worker. He was oppressed by the landlords in the past and dared not raise his head. After being liberated, he had land to cultivate and his life was secured. Last winter, he led twenty-nine young people to join the army.
    [This Dispatch from the Yu-Bei Front, 2nd] On the afternoon of last month, the Mingzi Unit dispatched Comrades Wang Shan and Jiang Zheng from the Political Department, bringing 50,000 Jicha banknotes, 395 eggs, 22 catties of dried noodles, and 78 packs of cigarettes, along with multiple letters of condolence from the unit's Party committee, to extend greetings to the new Taihang soldiers. After receiving the letters of condolence and the慰劳品 (consolation goods), the new recruit and people's militia hero Jin Bianwen called on everyone to bring honor to Taihang, not only by performing well in battle but also by striving to be models in their daily work. He proposed: (1) We must help the liberated soldiers study well. (2) We must learn practical skills in training. All the new soldiers responded to his call and resolved to do a good job, learn well, remember well, and strive for meritorious service.
