"Letters" and "Care Packages"
    Feng Nian

    Wu Qingshan wrote two letters to his wife, but received no reply. This time, he was very angry and wrote her a third letter. Trembling, he took up his pen and wrote:

    "Mei Xiang: We've sent you two letters in a row, and haven't received a single reply. Maybe you didn't get the letters? Or maybe you're very busy and don't have time to write to me? Hmph! I know you have some complaints about me! Now that we have democracy and equality between men and women, if you have complaints, just tell me! Why ignore me? If you have something on your mind, we can even di… vorce."

    He couldn't continue writing, overwhelmed by emotion. He didn't write his name or the date, folded the letter, put it in an envelope, and gave it to the military post.

    A month passed. He was in a state of turmoil, speculating about his wife. On May 1st, the Taihang Mountain Comfort Delegation came to our place. People jumped for joy at the sight of so many慰劳品 (consolation items). Old Li, a liberated soldier, saw two large carts loaded with慰问袋 (comfort bags) and felt it was both rare and joyful, so he ran home shouting, "Hey! They're pulling two big carts of comfort bags, come out and see!"

    Wu Qingshan was resting. He heard Old Li's shouts and immediately ran out to see.

    He ran out of the gate, and when he was still ten feet away from the carts pulling the comfort bags, he saw the words "Presented by Mei Xiang" written on the corner of a comfort bag at the rear of the cart. His heart immediately leapt. He ran over in two or three steps and immediately pulled out the comfort bag. On the top of the bag, on the left, was written: "To Comrade Wu Qingshan of the 'Hezhu' Unit." In the middle, in large characters, was written: "Wishing you good health and meritorious service in killing the enemy." On the right corner was written: "Presented by Mei Xiang." After reading this, he was so happy that he couldn't restrain the smile in his heart, but he was also shy, trying not to let the smile show on his face. His heart was pounding even harder. He trembled as he untied the bag. Inside he saw Jintan, soap, walnuts, persimmons, pears, and also needles and thread, and a letter. At this time, the people around him all shouted, "Your wife really cares about you, she's very thoughtful." Xiao Jincheng, a liberated soldier, had never seen these things on the Central Army side. He felt it was a bit strange. He grabbed Wu Qingshan's shoulder and said, "Read the letter to us!"

    Wu Qingshan was shy and embarrassed, and didn't read it. Everyone unanimously asked him to read it, but he still didn't. The mail clerk snatched it away and read it aloud. At this time, Wu Qingshan's face was as red as Guan Gong's.

    "Qingshan: I received all the letters you sent, don't be angry. Those days, the village work was just too busy, so I didn't reply to your letters. I don't have any complaints about you, but after reading your letter, it seems like you doubt me. I guarantee you, as long as you fight against Old Chiang, even if you've only been gone for two years, or even twenty years, nothing will change, you can rest assured and fight well against the enemy in the front!

    I'll tell you another good news, I think you'll be happy to hear it. This time, we've divided another three mu of land, so don't worry about the life at home, we have enough to eat and wear. If we have any difficulties, the democratic government will solve them for us. Mother is also very healthy, and I'm also fine, so don't worry. Okay, I'll talk to you later!

    Only by defeating the reactionary Old Chiang can we reunite and live a good life."

    After the mail clerk finished reading, everyone laughed happily. They all said, "Old Wu, you're really lucky to have such a good wife, look how progressive she is, what she said is so reasonable." After saying that, everyone still smiled broadly, teasing him.

    Xiao Jincheng was quite small-minded. He didn't believe that his wife was so good, and that the democratic government cared so much about the military dependents. He asked Old Wu, "Has your wife been to school?" He thought if she hadn't been to school, who would have written the letter for her.

    Old Wu said, "She went to senior primary school, she's more educated than me." After hearing this, and looking at the two big carts of comfort bags, he believed it. He thought silently for a while and said, "The folks in the liberated areas are just different, they are so good to the Eighth Route Army, and they care so much about the military dependents, even if I have to eat chaff every day from now on, I will fight Chiang Kai-shek to the end. So that my family can also be liberated."

    Old Li also said, "After defeating Old Chiang, I'm going to move my family to live in the liberated area."

　　“信”和“慰问袋”
    丰年
    吴清山给他老婆写了两封信，都不见回信。这次他非常气愤的给她写第三封信。他提着笔手颤动的写着：
    “梅香：咱连着给你去了两封信，一封回信都没有收到。大概你没有接到信吧？要不大概你很忙，没空给我写信？哼！我知道你对我有了意见！现在实行民主，男女平等，有意见给咱提吗？何必不理人呢？你有了什么心事咱们离……也可以。”
    他写到这里感情冲动的写不下去了，也不写自己的名和日子，摺了摺装到信封里交给军邮了。
    一个月过去了。他的心乱七八糟的猜想着他老婆。五月一日太行山慰问团到我们这里来。人们看见许多慰劳品高兴的又蹦又跳。老李是个解放战士，看见拉着两大车慰问袋觉着又希罕，又高兴，他便跑回家喊起来：“唉呀！拉着两大车慰问袋，快出来看呀！”
    吴清山正休息，他听见老李喊叫立即就跑出来看。
    他跑出大门，离拉慰问袋的大车还有一丈远的时候，一眼看见车后尾上一个慰问袋角上写着：“梅香赠”，他的心马上跳起来了。两三步便跑过去，一下就把慰问袋拉出来。袋上面左边写着：“给‘和主’部队吴清山同志。”当中用大字写着：“祝你身体健康，杀敌立功。”右角上写着：“梅香赠。”他看完喜的实在遏止不住心里的笑，但他又害羞，尽量不让笑在面上。他的心咚咚的跳的更加厉害。他颤抖着手把袋口解开。一看里面有仁丹、肥皂、核桃、柿子、梨、还有针和线，并且还有一封信。这时围在他周围的人们都嚷起来了：“你老婆对你真关心，想的真周到。”小金成是解放战士，这些东西在中央军那边他从未见到过。他觉着有点希奇。他扒着吴清山的肩膀说：“把信念给俺们听听吧！”
    吴清山羞羞答答的红着脸不念。大家一致要求他仍是不念。收发一下子夺过去大声读起来。这时吴清山的脸红的像关公一样。
    “清山：你来的信都收到了，你别生气。那几天村里工作就是忙，所以没给你回信。我对你没有一点意见，不过我看了你的信你对我好像有怀疑。我给你保证，只要你打老蒋，别说你才出去二年，就是二十年，海干石烂也发生不了一点问题，你在前方安心好好杀敌立功吧！
    我再告给你个好消息，想你听了一定高兴。这次咱又分了三亩地，家里的生活你一点也不要挂念，有吃有穿。有了困难民主政府就给咱解决了。母亲身体也很健康，我也很好，都不必挂念。好了，以后再谈吧！
    只有打垮反动派老蒋，我们才能团圆过好日子。”
    收发念罢，大家都高兴的嘻嘻的笑起来了。都说：“老吴你有这么个好老婆，真是你一辈子的福气，你看人家多进步，说的多么有理。”说罢大家仍裂着嘴笑，开着他的玩笑。
    小金成人小心眼可不少。他不相信他老婆这样好，民主政府对军属这样关心。他问老吴：“你老婆上过学没有？”他想如果她没上过学，这信不知谁给她编的哩。
    老吴说：“人家上过高小，学问比我还强哩”。他听了这话，又看一看那两大车慰问袋，他相信了。他默默的想了一会说：“解放区的老乡们就是不一样，对八路军就是好，对军属这样关心，往后天天让我吃糠，我也要和蒋介石这小子干到底。让俺家也得到解放。”
    老李也说：“把老蒋打垮了我也要把家搬到解放区来住。”
