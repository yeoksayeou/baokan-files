　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th—According to Shanghai newspapers: Chiang's Central Printing Factory has stopped printing small denomination banknotes and is concentrating on printing 10,000 yuan banknotes. The factory recently purchased four of the latest printing presses from the United States and decided to establish a large-scale banknote printing headquarters in Nanjing. The rate of inflation of Chiang's currency will increase even more alarmingly. At the same time, banknotes ordered by Chiang Kai-shek abroad continue to arrive in Shanghai by ship. On the 17th of this month, a Great American Company ship transported more than 500 boxes of new banknotes, which have been taken by the Central Bank. The Shanghai English-language "China Press" commented on the seriousness of Chiang Kai-shek's financial and economic crisis, stating: The economic situation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has reached a dead end. If the Chinese civil war drags on for another six months, it is hard to believe that Chiang Kai-shek's economy will not completely collapse.
　　
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th—According to a TASS report on the 21st: The Indian "Pakistan Times" published an article entitled "How the World is Being Fooled," stating: In the past two weeks, there have been constant reports of "Mongolian troops invading Xinjiang." This is a vile story fabricated by the Central News Agency to deceive the world. It also stated: The Chinese government (referring to the Chiang government) deliberately created "incidents" in an attempt to stimulate American anti-Soviet sentiment and expedite the allocation of funds to their depleted treasury.

　　蒋介石赶印万元大钞
    经济危机更深刻化
    中央社捏造“北塔山事件”是为了要美国加速拨款救命
    【新华社陕北廿四日电】据沪报讯：蒋记中央印制厂已停印小钞，集中赶印万元大钞。该厂最近自美国购得四架最新式之印钞机，并决定在南京建立大规模印钞总厂，蒋币膨胀速率将更惊人增加。同时，蒋介石在外国定印之钞票继续航运抵沪。本月十七日又有大美公司航船运到新钞五百余箱，已由中央银行提取。上海英文大美晚报对蒋介石在财政经济危机之严重性加以评论称：国民党区经济情形已至山穷水尽，倘中国内战再拖六个月，而蒋介石的经济不全盘崩溃，是难于置信的。
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】据塔斯社二十一日讯：印度《巴基斯坦时报》，以“全世界是怎样被愚弄的”为题撰文称：最近两周间，不断传来所谓“蒙古军队侵入新疆”的报导，此系中央社为愚弄全世界而捏造的恶浊故事。并谓：中国政府（按指蒋政府）故意制造“事件”，企图刺激美国反苏情绪，加速拨款给他们的枯竭的财库。
