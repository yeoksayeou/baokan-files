　　Yunju County Chief Hao Deeply Penetrates Border Villages
    Distributing Land Five Li from the Enemy
    [Reported by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 26th] County Chief Hao of our Yunju Democratic Government led the masses in investigating and distributing property while in a guerrilla environment. Huama Zhao Village in the first district of the county was a backward village with extremely strict feudal rule. Landlords controlled the village cadres and were perfunctory in carrying out land reform. More than 30 poor farmers are still starving. The landlords also colluded with the enemy's "Home Returning Corps," frequently coming to the village to loot grain, burn houses, and beat people. Four military families were persecuted daily. When County Chief Hao learned of this situation, he went to Huama Zhao Village himself and stayed at the home of a worker's family to further understand the situation. He immediately detained the families of four local bullies and landlords who colluded with the enemy and convened a mass meeting to expose the enemy's atrocities and the crimes of the "Home Returning Corps." He re-announced the land reform decree and repeatedly stated that he would resolutely support the masses. At this time, the enemy's gunfire continued four or five li away from the village, but the mass meeting continued calmly. County Chief Hao asked the masses, "How many households do not have enough to eat now?" More than 30 people stood up. He asked again, "Dare you do it or not?" The whole audience shouted, "Dare!" "Are you afraid?" "No!" The gunfire was still sounding. County Chief Hao led the masses to investigate the homes of landlords such as Zhao Guangdian. The starving farmers were unprecedentedly excited and scrambled to carry and search for things. A total of more than 4,000 jin of grain, more than 100 pieces of furniture, and three cattle were found. Immediately afterwards, following the principle of distributing more to poor military families and poor peasants, they democratically assessed and distributed the floating wealth. As a result, each person received 30 to 50 jin of grain and several pieces of clothing and furniture. An old man said, "No enemy is more formidable than starvation. With strength, we fear nothing."

　　郓巨郝县长深入边沿村
    距敌五里领导分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】我郓巨民主政府郝县长，在游击环境中带领群众查财分财。该县一区花马赵庄是个落后村，封建统治极严，地主掌握村干，应付土改，现仍有三十多家贫苦农民饿肚子。地主并勾结敌人“还乡团”，时常到该村抢粮烧房打人，四家军工一天天受着迫害。当郝县长知道这些情况后，即亲自到花马赵庄，住在××工属家，对情况又作了更进一步的了解，当即把四家通敌恶霸地主全家扣起来召开群众大会，揭发了敌人的暴行与“还乡团”罪恶，重新宣布土地改革法令，再三表示坚决给群众撑腰。这时离该村四五里地，敌人的枪声不断，但群众大会仍镇静的进行，郝县长向群众发问：“你们现在有多少户没有吃的”？三十多个群众呼的都站起来了，又问“敢干不敢干？”全场齐吼“敢！”“怕不怕？”“不怕！”枪声仍然响着。郝县长带领着群众向地主赵广殿等四家进行清查，饥饿的农民都空前的兴奋起来，争前恐后地搬运搜查东西。计共查出粮食四千多斤，家具百余件，牛三头。紧接着就按贫苦军属及贫农多分的原则，民主评议分浮财，结果每人分了三、五十斤粮食，几件衣服家具。一个老头说：“敌人再厉害也没有挨饿厉害有了力量，一切都不怕。”
