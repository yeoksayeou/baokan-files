Return Life to the People
    Guo Moruo
    Mr. Guo Moruo published an article entitled "Return Life to the People" in the "Human Rights Protection Special Issue" of Wenhui Daily on March 26, accusing the Chiang government of persecuting the people. The full text is as follows:
    Today, we still have to protest for the protection of human rights, which I find deeply painful. Who are we protesting to? What effect will the protest have? Not to mention the distant past, since the "January 21st" Kunming Massacre last year, we have been protesting every month for the past fourteen months, almost every day. But what's the use? The culprit was promoted, the murderer became a National Representative, and the beaten became criminals. The trampling of human rights has become increasingly unscrupulous, with arbitrary house raids and arrests, plunging the country into darkness. Two thousand people were arrested in Beijing overnight, and three thousand were arrested in Qingdao overnight. Since Liang Renda was beaten to death in the Shanghai Labor Building, people have been disappearing constantly. The lives of ordinary people are worse than ants! Who are we protesting to? The government said it didn't arrest them, and the people were "self-arrested"! We have such a government that "returns power to the people," so instead of making objectless protests, we might as well make an appeal to the government to "return life to the people"!
    "Government above, government above, 'returning power to the people' is really too much to bear. But please return life to the people, return life to the people, ordinary people really can't survive."

### 还命于民

　　还命于民
    郭沫若
    郭沫若先生于三月二十六日文汇报“人权保障特刊”发表“还命于民”一文，控诉蒋政府残害人民的罪行，全文如下：
    到今天我们还要来为保障人权抗议，我感觉到沉痛。到底向谁抗议呢？抗议会有什么效果？远的且不说，从前年“一二一”昆明惨案以来，十四个月当中，月月都在抗议，更差不多天天都在抗议，然而有什么用？祸首升了官，凶手作了国民代表，挨了打的成了罪人。人权的蹂躏，愈来愈加肆无忌惮，任意抄家，任意捕人，弄得暗无天日。北平一夜搜捕两千，青岛一夜被搜捕三千人，上海自劳工大楼打死梁仁达以来，不断的有人失踪，小民的生命真是比蚂蚁还不如了！向谁抗议呢？政府说不是他捕的，人要算是“自行被捕”了！我们有了这样“还政于民”的政府，我们与其毫无对象的提出抗议，倒还不如向政府作一次“还命于民”的呼吁吧！
    “政府在上，政府在上，‘还政于民’，实在不敢当。但请还命于民，还命于民，小百姓实在活不下去了。”
