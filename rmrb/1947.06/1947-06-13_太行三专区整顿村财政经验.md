Experiences in Rectifying Village Finances in the Taihang Third Special District

　　In May of this year, the Third Special District proposed that village funds should be raised and managed by the village itself, and that each village should plant a "money tree" (rectify village public property and invest in reproduction) to ensure that village-level expenses and all social burdens are not levied on the masses, and to overcome extravagance and waste. This work is arduous and must be carried out patiently, boldly, and by following the mass line. Based on the past six months, we have the following experiences:

　　I. How to Get Things Moving

　　1. Combine current affairs education with accounting to get through to the cadres' thinking, so that they fully understand the current financial difficulties. After accounting in Dongguan Town Village, Lucheng, and other places, the cadres were shocked and decided to rectify financial work. At the cadre expansion meeting in Ping顺 County, a special study was conducted on the rectification of village financial work, and it was proposed that good cadres should do a good job in financial work to increase the importance attached to this work. 2. Overcome the cadre-centric thinking. However, when the rectification of village finances began, the following ideological concerns were found among the village cadres, which hindered the development of the work: (1) They were afraid of adjusting the public property of their village to other villages. (2) They were afraid that after the public property was rectified to fill the loopholes, they would have to collect money from the masses for future expenses, which would make it difficult for them. (3) A few cadres had unclean procedures in the past and were afraid that the rectification would cause mass struggles, and showed negative resistance. (4) Various systems are unwilling to unify the rectification of their own property, fearing that future expenses will not be arbitrary. (5) It is believed that the rectification of village financial work has been mentioned before, and it is always useless. When these ideas were discovered, the leaders immediately put forward slogans such as "Lay down the burden, don't be self-centered, and make meritorious service in rectifying finance," combined with the meritorious service campaign, to increase the enthusiasm of the cadres, and decided: (1) Those who voluntarily report personal ambushes will not be punished. (2) It is guaranteed that the public property that has been sorted out will be owned by the village to solve the village's expenses. (3) After the property of each system is sorted out, it will be managed uniformly, but it will still be used by each system. This solved the cadres' ideological concerns and began to take action actively. 3. Create a mass-based rectification movement. We should recognize that as long as there are cadre leaders, the masses are very willing to rectify village finances. For example, when Zhangjing Village was being rectified, Zhang Wenlin said: "This can be done beautifully, otherwise some scattered public objects will be destroyed, and they will not be worth a penny. Sort them out quickly, so we don't have to pay more burdens." Yang Biaoke said: "I have kept dead things for half a lifetime and missed some dead work. It is right to turn dead things into living money, this must be of great help." Liu Fuyuan said: "Raising soldiers for a thousand days, using them for a while, now selling the old stage props can solve the current difficulties." After deliberation, the masses and cadres realized the importance of rectifying village finances, and they all volunteered to report and sent the stools, tables, pots, chairs, etc. they had kept to a centralized place.

　　II. What Property to Rectify

　　1. According to the practices in various places, all old public property, public land, and public objects, except for the addresses of the village public office and school and those that are useful, are auctioned or dismantled and sold (such as mountain temples), etiquette items, small society tents and musical instruments (except for a part for entertainment), and feudal and superstitious items (such as temple fair flags and umbrellas) are all auctioned. The public trees are democratically discussed. Those over three feet thick are organized by the masses to select finished products for sale or subsidize construction, and those under three feet are kept to grow. Bricks, tiles, and wood can be auctioned. In Changzhi's second and third districts, the gold pasted on the mud statues and plaques was stripped off and sold, which also generated a lot of income. Secondly, voluntarily report concealed grain, such as 5,000 catties of concealed millet voluntarily reported in the fifth district of Changzhi. 2. Organize mass production to lay the foundation for the production fund. For example, in order to solve financial problems, the masses in Qingjia Village, Licheng, launched a wasteland reclamation and firewood chopping campaign, with the slogan: "Work hard to reclaim wasteland, and don't let our village be without a school." Some villages' masses and teachers helped each other in changing work, which solved the teachers' salaries. 3. Rectify the charity granaries. Some villages have implemented the green release and autumn harvest system. In addition to helping poor farmers, the remaining part is invested in reproduction to solve village expenses.

　　III. The Masses Manage Their Own Affairs

　　When the masses realize the importance of rectifying finance, they have many ways to manage their property. They elect representatives to organize various committees to be responsible for managing production and managing expenses. For example, in Changzhi it is called "Finance Committee," in Ping顺 it is called "Political and Financial Management Committee," and some are called "Economic Committee." After sorting out, the burden on the masses has been reduced a lot. In Licheng alone (for half a year), educational expenses were saved by 745,600 yuan, 399,800 catties of millet, and village expenses were saved by 558,400 catties of millet. Lucheng County achieved self-sufficiency in half a year. After the property of various systems is sorted out, various wastes and extravagances have been reduced a lot.

### 太行三专区整顿村财政经验

　　太行三专区整顿村财政经验
    本年五月三专区便提出村款村筹，村款村管，每村栽棵摇钱树（整顿村公产，投资再生产），做到村级经费及一切社会负担不向群众征收。克服铺张浪费现象。这件工作是个艰巨工作，必须耐心，大胆放手，走群众路线才能做好。根据半年来，有以下几点经验：
    一、如何行动起来的
    １、结合时事教育，用算账方式打通干部思想，使充分认识目前财政困难。潞城东关镇村等地算账后，干部大吃一惊，决定整好财政工作。平顺县扩干会上，对整顿村财政工作，作了专门研究，并提出好干部要做好财政工作，以提高对这一工作的重视。２、克服干部本位思想，但开始整顿村财政时，村干部中又发现以下几个思想顾虑，妨碍工作的发展：（一）怕将本村公产调剂于他村。（二）怕整顿出公产填了窟窿，今后开支再向群众征收，自己作难。（三）有个别干部过去手续不干净，怕整顿时，引起群众斗争，而表现消极抵抗。（四）各系统不愿将本单位财产统一整顿，怕将来开支不随便。（五）认为整顿村财政工作早已提过，总是个不顶事。当发现这些思想后，领导上马上提出：“放包袱，不本位，整顿财政立功劳”等口号，结合立功运动，提高干部热情，并决定：（１）个人埋伏自报者不予处分。（２）整理出的公产保证归本村所有，解决本村开支问题。（３）整理后各系统之财产统一管理，但仍归各系统开支。这样解决了干部思想上的顾虑，开始积极行动起来。３、造成群众性的整理运动。我们应该认识，只要有干部领导，群众是很愿意把村财政整顿好的。如张井村整顿时，张文淋说：“这可弄美啦，不然都把些零碎公物毁了，一个钱也不值啦，赶紧整理一下，省的咱多出负担。”杨表刻说：“我保管了半辈死东西，误了些死工，这样把死东西变成活钱，该顶多大事哩！”刘福元说：“养兵千日，用兵一时，现在把旧行头卖了，能解决现在困难。”经过酝酿，群众干部都体会到整顿村财政的重要后，就都纷纷自报出来，把自己保存的凳子、桌、锅、椅等都挤挤拥拥送到集中地方。
    二、整顿那些财产
    １、根据各地作法是把旧有公产、公地、公物，除村公所与学校住址及有用外，其余均拍卖或拆卖（如山庙），礼节、行头小社帐棚乐器（除留一部娱乐）及封建迷信器具（如庙会旗伞等），全部拍卖，公树由民主讨论，三尺粗以上者组织群众选成成品出卖或补助建设，三尺以下者仍留着生长，砖瓦木料均可拍卖。长治二、三区将泥神像与匾上贴的金剥下出卖，也收入很大。其次自报埋伏粮，如长治五区自报埋伏小米五千斤。２、组织群众生产，奠定生产基金。如黎城青家＠村群众为了解决财政问题，发动了开荒砍柴运动，提的口号是：“多出力气多开荒，不让咱村没书房。”有的村群众与教员互助变工，解决了教员薪金。３、整顿义仓。有部分村已执行了青放秋收制度，除救济贫苦农民外，所剩余之部分投资再生产，解决村开支。
    三、群众自己管理当家
    当群众认识到整顿财政的重要时，他们是很有办法管理家当的，他们自己选代表组织了各种委员会，负责经营生产与管理开支等事宜。如长治叫“财政委员会”，平顺叫“政财管理委员会”，还有的叫“经济委员会”，经过整理，群众负担减轻不少。单黎城（半年计）教育费节省洋七十四万五千六百元，小米三十九万九千八百斤，村经费节省小米五十五万八千四百元。潞城全县做到半年自给。各系统之财产整理后，即减少了不少各种浪费与铺张。
