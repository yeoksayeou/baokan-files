    [This Newspaper Frontline Sixteenth Dispatch] The General Headquarters Directly Subordinate Units under General Liu Bocheng recently notified all directly subordinate organizations to study the New China News Agency's "May 1st" editorial and the two documents of authoritative figures of the Chinese Communist Party commenting on the current situation. This is to clarify their thinking and fully prepare for the great counter-offensive. The notice pointed out: It is necessary to strengthen ideological preparation in order to undertake the major, glorious, and arduous tasks of the great counter-offensive.
