Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to delayed news from New York: When the Security Council discussed the report of the Military Staff Committee earlier this month, Soviet Representative Gromyko delivered a speech analyzing the important issues on which the committee had failed to reach an agreement, clarifying the main differences among the five powers on these issues. Regarding the issue of supplying armed forces, the Soviet Union, based on the provisions of the United Nations Charter, advocated that the permanent members of the Security Council should maintain equal status in supplying armed forces, not only in terms of the same number of troops but also in terms of the same organization of land, sea, and air forces. However, other national delegations proposed the principle of supplying relatively similar armed forces, meaning that each member state would only supply armed forces that were approximately similar in type, and could differ in strength and organization, allowing some of the five powers to mainly supply air forces, while others mainly supply land forces, and so on. This meant creating a favorable position in terms of the number of troops for certain countries, allowing certain powers to use armed institutions for their own benefit, harming the legitimate interests of other countries. Regarding the issue of bases, British and American representatives proposed that the United Nations should not only provide the Security Council with military assistance and facilities, but also with land, sea, and air force bases. The Soviet representative believed that the United Nations Charter only mentioned military assistance and facilities, including the right of transit, but not bases. Moreover, the Charter stipulates that the right of transit must be permitted through special agreements with signatory countries. On the issue of troop stationing, the Soviet Union proposed that, according to the Charter, troops could only be stationed on their own national territory, while the joint proposal of the United Kingdom, the United States, and China (Chiang), and the proposal of France, considered that troops could be stationed on their own national territory and on territories and seas outside their own country. The Soviet proposal argued that without a mission designated by the Security Council, troops stationed outside their own country would cause disputes in the host country and have an impact beyond the local significance, serving as a tool of political pressure for those countries. Regarding the issue of troop withdrawal and stationing time, the Soviet Union proposed that, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, after the troops under the command of the Security Council had completed their peacekeeping mission, they should be withdrawn to their own national territory or airspace within thirty to ninety days. However, other countries proposed that they should be withdrawn "as soon as possible" to locations stipulated in special agreements after completing their designated mission. The Soviet Union believed that if these clauses were accepted, it would allow troops serving in foreign countries to be stationed in various places for a long time, disregarding the sovereignty of certain United Nations member states and infringing upon the interests of small countries. Regarding the issue of troop equipment, the Soviet Union argued that the countries supplying troops should adequately supply these troops with weapons, equipment, and transportation facilities, but some countries argued that the countries supplying troops should not be responsible for the obligation of equipping the troops, believing that some countries would supply troops, while others would supply weapons, equipment, and transportation. This would mean that certain powers would take advantage of this possibility to supply equipment to the troops of other countries, thereby gaining an advantage in the troops under the command of the Security Council to influence certain countries. Regarding other unresolved issues, Gromyko analyzed and refuted them one by one. Finally, Gromyko expressed the hope that the Security Council's discussion of the Military Staff Committee's report would help reach agreement on some issues; the Soviet Union would do its utmost to ensure that these important issues are resolved.

　　关于安理会军队问题
    苏代表分析各国意见的分歧点
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据纽约迟到消息：苏联代表葛罗米柯于本月初安理会讨论军事参谋委员会报告时曾发表演说，对该会未获协议的重要问题逐一加以分析，阐明五强对这些问题的主要分歧。关于供给军队问题，苏联根据联合国宪章规定，主张安理会常任理事国应保持供给军队的平等地位，不仅是相同的兵力，而且是相同组织的陆海空军。但是其他国家代表团提出供给相对相同军队的原则，即各理事国仅仅供给种类上近似相同的军队，在兵力和组织上都可以互相不同，允许五强中某些国家主要供给空军，而其他国家主要供给陆军等等。这意味着给某些国家造成在军队数目方面的有利地位。使某些强国利用武装机构为自己谋利，损害其他国家合法利益。关于基地问题，英美代表提议联合国不仅供给安理会以军队协助及便利，而且应供给陆海空军基地。苏联代表认为联合国宪章只提到军队协助便利，包括过境权，但没有基地。而且在宪章上规定过境权必须经由签字国的特别协议方能允许。在军队留驻问题上，苏联提议根据宪章规定，只能驻扎在本国领土上，而英美中（蒋）三国联合提议与法国提议认为军队可驻扎本国领土与本国以外的领土与领海上。苏联提议认为没有安理会指定的任务，驻在本国以外的军队会使驻在国产生纠纷和发生超过地方意义之影响，会作为那些国家的政治压力的工具。关于军队撤退及驻扎时间问题，苏联提议按照联合国宪章规定安理会支配下的军队完成其维持和平任务后，应在三十天至九十天内撤回其本国领土或领空。但其他国家提议应在完成指定任务后，“尽速”撤退至特别协议之规定地点。苏联认为假使接受了这些条款，就会使服役于外国的军队长期驻扎各地，轻视某些加入联合国国家的主权，侵害到小国的利益。关于军队装备问题，苏联主张供给军队的国家自己应该适当地供给这些军队以武器、装备和运输便利，但若干国家却主张供给军队的国家不应负责装备军队的义务，认为某些国家供给军队，而另一些国家则供给武器、装备和运输。这将意味着某些强国利用了这种可能性供应装备他国军队，借此在安理会支配的军队中占优势地位以影响某些国家。关于其他未获协议问题，葛罗米柯都逐一加以分析和驳斥。最后葛罗米柯表示希望安理会讨论军事参谋委员会报告，将有助于获致若干问题的协议；苏联将尽其所能使这些重要问题获得协议。
