(Reported by our Taiyue correspondent on the 20th) Xin绛, a well-known commercial center in southern Shanxi, has been thriving in the two months since liberation. Before the war, Xin绛 was a distribution center for goods from 36 counties in southern Shanxi, with over 2,000 shops. Known as "Southern Jiang and Northern Dai," it shared a reputation with Daixian, the commercial center of northern Shanxi. However, under the brutal rule of the Japanese puppets, Chiang Kai-shek, and Yan Xishan, it gradually declined, with only a quarter of the businesses remaining. Yan Xishan's rampant extortion was such that in the first three months of this year, he had already extracted 214 million yuan from the merchants in the urban area, in addition to conscription (last year, 100 conscripts were levied from the merchants, with a "replacement fee" of 1.5 million Chiang Kai-shek yuan per person). The plummeting value of Chiang Kai-shek currency (100, 200, 400, and 500 yuan notes were all rendered worthless) further exacerbated the plight of the merchants.

After the county was liberated in early April, some of the larger merchants initially harbored doubts due to the slanderous propaganda of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. However, according to Mr. Zhang Shutian, the president of the Chamber of Commerce who has been doing business in Jiang for 30 years (owner of Jirongfu Jinghuo Store), and many other merchants, they understood everything as soon as they came into contact with the People's Liberation Army. The democratic government, in addition to legally confiscating seven shops such as the "Helian Cooperative," "Material Preparation Depot," and "Oil and Salt Shop" operated by Yan's puppet regime, as well as factories such as the Dayi Yarn Factory, Rongyu Yarn Factory, and electric mills, immediately announced a policy to protect private businesses. As a result, most of the 550 private businesses in the city opened their doors on April 8th, the day after liberation. Our trade company also transported and sold 6,000 piculs of grain and 30,000 catties of salt to supply the masses. Merchants from the old liberated areas came to purchase fabrics and various necessities, bringing with them large quantities of ironware, silk thread, medicinal materials, and local products. The stagnant market immediately became active.

After liberation, prices stabilized, and the prices of grain and other commodities fell. The price of wheat fell by 15%, sorghum was only a quarter of its original price, and salt fell by 30% (wheat was 1,200 yuan per dou, sorghum 200 yuan, corn 300 yuan, and salt 56 yuan per catty). The main reason for this was the stability of finance in the liberated areas. Merchants trusted the currency of the liberated areas, with Jinnan currency initially exchanging at 8 yuan per Chiang Kai-shek yuan, now at a ratio of 1 to 15. All merchants sincerely loved the democratic government, and when the business tax was levied a month ago, most of it was paid up within ten days.

Before the war, Xin绛's industry and commerce included 350 handicraft workshops for cotton weaving, fur, copper and tin, hat shops, stationery shops, cigarette making, and other industries, as well as factories for electric lights, matches, and textiles. The two yarn factories were at their peak with 28,000 spindles. However, in recent years, they have been strangled and swallowed by the brutal rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan. For example, the "Jintai Iron Factory," founded in 1921, was forcibly seized by the "Jinxing Enterprise Company," a large trust in Shanxi controlled by Xu Shiyi, a crony of Yan Xishan. Manager Chuan was imprisoned for resisting, and was only released from prison after our army liberated Xin绛 this time. Handicraft industry was also largely destroyed by the double whammy of American goods dumping and heavy taxes, with fewer than 60 surviving.

After the democratic government entered the city, it first provided low-interest loans of 5 million yuan to small handicraft industries on the verge of bankruptcy, and then distributed 400 piculs of grain and wheat to workers as relief. Furthermore, by blocking the entry of American goods and opening up trade relations with the old liberated areas, all goods sold well, especially cotton fabrics, which were in short supply even with round-the-clock production after the existing stock was sold out. Therefore, in the past two months, in addition to the original ones reorganizing and developing their businesses, 40 new cotton weaving businesses alone have been established, bringing the total to 70 including the existing ones. The cigarette industry, which had been crushed by the influx of American cigarettes, has also reopened entirely. The workers said, "The People's Liberation Army has saved us!" Currently, there are a total of 121 various small factories and workshops. The development of the cotton weaving industry has also stimulated rural women's spinning (Note: This area is a cotton-producing area, and spinning one catty of yarn now earns wages of seven sheng of wheat).

　　新绛商业日趋繁荣
    棉织品等供不应求
    【本报太岳二十日电】晋南著名商业区新绛，解放两月中日趋繁荣。新绛战前为晋南三十六县货物集散地，共有商店两千余家，所谓“南绛北代”，向与晋北商业中心代县同享盛名，然在日伪蒋阎暴政下逐年萎缩，商业残存的仅四分之一，阎顽横征暴敛，今年初三个月已向城关商民勒索两亿一千四百余万元，外加征兵，（去年向商户征壮丁一百名，“买丁”一名一百五十万蒋币。）蒋币狂跌（百元、二百、四百、五百元蒋币皆已作废）等影响，商民困苦不堪。四月初旬该县解放后，最初一些大商号因受蒋阎反动诬蔑所惑，怀有疑虑，但据在绛经商三十年的商会会长张书田先生（积荣福京货庄老板）及许多商民谈：他们一与解放军接触，便什么都明白了。民主政府除将阎伪公营的“合联社”“实物准备库”“油脂食盐铺”等七家商店，与大益纱厂，荣裕纱厂，电磨等工厂依法没收外，立即宣布保护民商政策，所以全城五百五十家私商在解放之次日——四月八日即大部开门，我贸易公司并运售粮食六千石，食盐三万斤供给群众。老解放区商人纷来采购布匹及各种必需品，带来大批铁货、丝线、药材土产，萧条的市场立即活跃，解放后物价稳定，粮食等皆有下跌，麦价跌至百分之十五，高粱仅及原价四分之一，食盐跌至百分之卅，（麦子每大斗一千二百元，高粱二百元，玉茭三百元，食盐每斤五十六元）。主要原因是解放区金融稳定，商民皆信任解放区货币，冀南钞最初每元兑蒋钞八元，现在已为一比十五。各商对民主政府衷心爱戴，月前征摊营业税时，十天即已大部缴齐。新绛工商业战前有棉织、皮毛、铜锡、帽店、笔墨庄、卷烟等手工业作场三百五十家，并有电灯、火柴、纺织等工厂，两家纱厂最盛时两万八千个锭子，惟数年来遭蒋阎暴政所绞杀并吞，如创业于民国十年的“晋泰铁工厂”等，便为阎顽控制山西的大托拉斯徐士珙系“晋兴企业公司”所强霸，经理传某因反抗被押、直至此次我军解放新绛后，才把他从监狱中放出去。手工业也因美货倾销和苛捐杂税双管齐下而大部摧毁残存者不足六十家，民主政府进城后，首向濒于破产的小手工业低利贷款五百万元，又向工人发救济粮麦子四百石，又因阻塞美货来路，打通与老解放区贸易关系，各货畅销，尤其棉织物，所存旧货被购空后，日夜赶制都供不应求。故两月来，除原有的重新整顿发展业务外，新开设者仅棉织业已达四十家，连原有者计七十家。前被美国纸烟倾锁冲垮的卷烟业，也已全部开门，工人们说：“解放军把我们救活了”，现在各种小型工厂作坊，共计一百二十一家，棉织业的发展又刺激了农村妇纺。（按：此地为棉产区，现纺一斤线可得工资七升麦子。）
