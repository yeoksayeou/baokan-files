　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 24th: With the wheat harvest successively concluded in the Ji-Lu-Yu Region, 300,000 liberated farmers began dyke restoration work again around the 15th. Concentrating all their strength, they are striving to complete the project before the major flood. Counties not bordering the Yellow River are fully supporting the counties bordering the Yellow River. 30,000 civilian laborers from Yanggu have already set off to assist the Shouzhang section; Puxian and Guancheng have drawn 7,000 civilian laborers to help the Fanxian section. All counties engaged in construction have organized women and elderly remaining at home to continue re-examination work and mutual assistance in production, ensuring that the families of dyke repair workers do not leave an inch of land uncultivated or delay a minute of work. They have also organized comfort groups and written letters of appreciation, reporting to the dyke repair workers on the production and re-examination achievements at home.
