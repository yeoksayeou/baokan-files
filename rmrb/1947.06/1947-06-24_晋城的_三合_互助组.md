　　The "Three-Combine" Mutual Aid Teams of Jincheng
    Zheng Siyuan
    Using ingenuity to solve the "three non-delays"
    Jincheng is a region with relatively developed handicrafts and transportation industries. In villages and districts along major transportation routes, carrying loads by shoulder pole is even more common. A proverb circulates among the masses: "Smooth paths in Taiyuan, ropes in Qin Prefecture, shoulder poles in Jincheng, even if the land is all barren, as long as the carrying pole goes out the door." The masses urgently demand to "go out and make a living." In Jincheng, relying solely on agriculture cannot sustain farmers' livelihoods, let alone "cultivating three, surplus one."
    "Agriculture is primary, sideline is secondary." Jincheng farmers, recalling the famine conditions during the enemy and puppet rule in 1932, would be horrified: "Not cultivating the land and not harvesting grain doesn't count," agricultural production must not be delayed.
    In the patriotic self-defense war, everything was for the victory of the front lines, and production also must not be delayed for participation in the war.
    Cadres and the masses racked their brains for these "three non-delays." Ling Shang Village did not solve this contradiction well (not just Ling Shang Village). Cadres restricted the masses from going out to carry loads, not issuing travel permits. More than a dozen young and middle-aged farmers lay in bed for five days. The masses expressed dissatisfaction with the village cadres, and the village cadres also complained: "Being a cadre means taking flak from three sides. If you don't complete the task, you get flak from above; if you don't let the people go out to carry loads, you get flak from the masses; if you delay your own production, you get flak from your wife. Cadres, cadres, become radishes!"
    Each village has its own creations
    North Slope, Yu Neng…in different corners, east, south, west, and north, they have created a "three-combine" mutual aid team production organization by coincidence: tightly integrating participation in the war, agriculture, and sideline occupations within a mutual aid team, resolving the contradictions between the three.
    The "three-combine" mutual aid team of Li Gou Village, using a rotational method, rotates participation in the war, rotates carrying loads, and rotates farming. It organized 210 self-defense team members who could participate in the war and engage in production, dividing them into three squads. Each squad was led by the village chief, the farmers' association chairman, and the political director, respectively. One squad participated in the war, the second squad farmed, and the third squad transported goods. The self-defense team members in each squad were dispersed within the mutual aid teams. Among the 110 militiamen, 40 were in the expeditionary force, only rotating for battle and not providing labor service; 70 were in the guard team, providing labor service like the self-defense team, but not for short-term labor service, usually guarding the village, standing sentry, and performing alert duties, returning home to practice martial arts for one hour every morning. Each mutual aid team had one production team leader, one martial arts team leader, one women's team leader, one propaganda worker, and one women's worker. The entire village of 381 households, with a total of 48 mutual aid teams, was essentially a wartime mass organization, with participation in the war, agriculture, and sideline occupations all being unimpeded.
    Distribution according to labor
    The three-combine mutual aid team of North Slope, led by Village Chief Comrade Tian Heyong's first team, served as a model. The entire team consisted of ten households with four livestock. Agricultural production was based on work points, implementing work tickets, and issuing work tickets as soon as they went to the fields. When going to the fields, they had to carry a load of manure, and everyone was afraid of doing less work and getting fewer work tickets. This year's spring plowing and sowing cost three work points per mu, saving one and a half work points compared to the previous four and a half work points per mu. The land of those participating in the war and transporting goods was cultivated by the mutual aid team. They gave wage rice. One day of participation in the war was counted as one work point, and one day of militia rotation was counted as 1.2 work points. Before departure, the sideline production of the team would first provide travel expenses. Rotation and labor service were calculated by the whole village.
    There was a team member named Monk, a master of transporting and reselling grain. He drove the team's one mule and two donkeys for transportation. Each household contributed 2,500 yuan, which at the time was one stone of wheat, 10,000 in capital. Two households could not afford it, so the village chief and the team temporarily advanced the money, borrowing 80,000 from the bank to send sulfur to Changzhi and carry iron nails to Yincheng…In fifty days, they earned 130,000, dividing the profits 20/80, with 20% going to the transportation labor, Monk getting one share, the mule getting two shares, and the donkey getting one share, allocated according to five shares; the remaining eight shares went to the mutual aid team, with 40% being dividends for the money shares and 40% being dividends for the shares of the entire team. Whoever participated in labor received dividends, regardless of gender, regardless of agricultural or sideline occupation, you get 10%, he gets 8%, or as little as 3% or 2%. Monk was also counted as 10%, and even widows could get sideline dividends. The entire team was highly motivated, and no one wanted to leave the mutual aid team.
    The sixth mutual aid team of @Yu Village, led by elementary school teacher Jin Faqing, consisted of 14 households with 15 laborers, withdrawing five laborers to stir iron ore. They did not provide labor service, only providing labor service rice. The remaining people and land were subject to mutual aid labor exchange. One work point was four and a half sheng of rice. Stirring ore for one day was counted as two work points, earning nine sheng of rice; in fact, each person could pull five carts per day, each cart worth 350 yuan, totaling 1,750 yuan. Nine sheng of rice was worth 450 yuan, and the remaining 1,300 yuan belonged to the team. Whether agricultural, sideline, or participation in the war, all were divided according to work points, but you had to deduct the work points lost on your own land before you could share the dividends. Members of the people's militia participating in the war were credited 1.2 work points per day, and militiamen on rotation were credited 1.5 work points per day. Labor service tickets were issued uniformly by the administrative village. Labor service tickets could be exchanged for work tickets. When those not providing labor service returned work time, one day of labor service without meals was credited one work point, and one day of labor service with meals was credited half a work point. Farming was mutual aid labor exchange, and sideline labor received dividends. This "labor" not only included the "labor" of sideline occupations, etc., but also included the "labor" of agriculture and participation in the war. Workers did not provide labor service, and could still farm the land, allowing them to concentrate on handicrafts and transportation, etc. Farmers participating in the war and farming could also share the dividends from sideline occupations, satisfying both workers and farmers.
    Labor Cooperative
    Yu Neng Village had the most workers. Out of only 158 men with full or partial labor power, 114 were workers, with five iron ore caves, one coal kiln, two silk stripping frames, and ten steel hoe workers. These people also managed this piece of land, so they were also farmers. Under the leadership of Political Director Comrade Sun Xiaopang, the entire village was organized. Each mutual aid team was a labor cooperative. For example, the fifth team was composed of liberated households, refugees who had just fled back from Yueyang, with the highest labor enthusiasm. The entire team had two blacksmiths, two coppersmiths, four silk stripping workers, five coal kiln workers, two cotton ginning workers, and three strainer workers, and three militiamen. Their mutual aid labor exchange method was: agricultural mutual aid labor exchange was five xiang per work point, with each xiang counted as one small work point. Five small work points per day were considered one large work point. For defaulting on work, five sheng of wage rice were repaid, and the harvested grain belonged to the individual. For handicraft production, after deducting each worker's wages and deducting 20% of the profit as capital, the remaining profit was publicly owned by the team and "distributed according to labor." Initially, one day was counted as one work point regardless of agriculture, sideline occupations, or participation in the war. Later, it was changed to agricultural work points based on tasks, and sideline work points based on piecework. Weaving one zhang and five chi of cloth was counted as one work point. If you could weave three zhang in one day, it was counted as two work points. Sideline occupations such as transportation and small stove work that could not be measured by piecework were counted by the day. Those who earned more were rewarded with a bonus system, with the remaining profits going to the public. The land of labor service members and militiamen, and the land of workers, were completely solved by the mutual aid team, allowing them to participate in the war and work with peace of mind.
    The entire village had a general cooperative, which specialized in transferring and helping various teams engage in production, such as borrowing money from the bank and then distributing it to various small cooperatives. The general cooperative pressed oil, and the oil cakes were carried up and down the mountain by various teams without capital. At that time, the city price was 15 yuan per jin, but the general cooperative sold it to the small cooperatives at 12 yuan per jin. After arriving at Shanwang Village, it was sold at the market price below the mountain, and the money earned belonged to the team. The team wove strainers, and the general cooperative was responsible for transporting them out for sale, and also collected silk threads and raw materials for the team from outside. The entire village has now become a large labor mutual aid factory.

　　晋城的“三合”互助组
    郑思远
    用心思解决了三不误
    晋城是手工业和运输业比较发达的地区，沿交通大道的区村，运输担挑更为发达，群众中流传着一句谚语：“太谷溜届、沁州绳，圪瘩坡扁担晋城人，那怕地土全荒了，只要担挑出了门。”群众迫切要求，“出去活闹”，在晋城专靠农业维持不了农民的生活，更不用说“耕三余一”了。
    “农业为主，副业为副”，晋城农民回忆起三十二年，敌伪统治时代的灾荒情景，就会惊心触目：“不种地不打粮食不算话”，农业生产也不能误。
    爱国自卫战争中，一切为了前线的胜利，生产也不能误了参战。
    干部和群众为了这“三不误”，费尽了心思。岭上村没有很好的解决这个矛盾（不只岭上一村），干部限制群众不让出去担挑，不给开路条，有十几个青壮年农民在炕上躺了五天没起来。群众对村干部表示不满，村干部也发出怨言：“当干部三头受气，完不成任务，受上级的气；不让老百姓出去担挑，受群众的气；误了自家的生产，受老婆的气。干部，干部，干成萝卜啦！”
    各村都有了创造
    北坡、庾能…………东南西北不同的角落里，不约而同的创造了“三合”互助组的生产组织：把参战、农业、副业紧紧的结合在一个互助组内，解决了三者的矛盾。
    李沟村的“三合”互助组，是以轮流的方式，轮流参战、轮流担挑、轮流种地，组织了全村能参战和能生产的自卫队员共二百一十人，分为三个中队，每中队由村长、农会主席、政治主任分头带领，一中队参战、二中队种地、三中队运输，每个中队的自卫队都分散在互助组内。民兵一百一十人中，四十人为远征队，只轮战不支差；七十人为警卫队，和自卫队一样支差，但不支短差，平素担任本村站岗放哨警戒工作，每天上午回家练武一小时。每个互助组中有生产组长一人，练武组长一人，妇女组长一人，宣传干事一人，妇女干事一人，全村三百八十一户，共四十八个互助组，全村群众俨然是一个战时化的群众组织，参战、农业、副业都不误。
    按劳分红
    北坡的三合互助组，以村长田合用同志所领导的第一组为典型。全组十户，有四头牲口，农业生产按活计工，实行工票，出地头即开工票。临上地要捎上一担粪，谁也怕自己少做了活少得工票。今年春耕下种每亩地合三个工，比往年每亩春地四个半工，省了一个半工。参战和运输人员的土地，由互助组耕种，他们给出工资米，参战一天算一工，民兵轮战一天算一工二，临出发先由小组副业生产中拿盘费、轮战、支差、由全村满打满算。
    有一个组员叫和尚，运输大贩粜是行家，他赶了组里一骡二驴跑运输。每户拿二千五百元，当时是一石麦、一万资金，有两户出不起，由村长和和暂垫，在银行贷了八万款，去长治送硫磺、荫城担铁钉……五十天赚了十三万，二八分红，二成归了跑运输的劳力，和尚人顶一份，骡顶二份，驴顶一份，按五份分配；那八份归互助组、四成为钱股红利，四成为全组人股红利，谁参加劳动谁分红，不论男女，不论农副业，你十分他八分，少则三分、二分，和尚也算十分，寡妇老婆也能分到副业红利。全组生产情绪很高，谁也不愿退出互助组。
    ＠峪村由小学教员靳发庆所领导的第六互助组，共十四户有十五个劳动力，抽出五个劳动力去搅铁矿，他们不支差，只出支差米，其余人和地，互助变工，一工四升半米，搅一天矿，算二工，赚九升米；实际每人每天能拉五车，每车三五○元，共值一千七百五十元，九升米值四百五十元，下余一千三百元归小组，不论农业、副业、参战都按工批红，但须除掉你自己土地上所误的工数，才能分红。本组民夫参战，一天顶一工二分，民兵轮战一天顶工半，差票由行政村统一发，差票可换工票，不出差人还工时，不吃饭一差还一工，吃饭工半还一工。种地是互助变工，副业劳力分红，这个“劳”不仅包括副业等的“劳”，而且也包括农业和参战的“劳”，工人不支差，又能种上地，可以安心从事手工业和运输等生产，农民参战种地也能分得副业的红利，工农都满意。
    劳动合作社
    庾能村工人最多，男子全半劳力仅一五八人，就有一一四是工人，铁矿洞五个、煤窑一座，抽条丝架两架，造钢铮工人十个，这些人自己又经管这一块土地，所以又是农民，在政治主任孙小胖同志的领导下，全村都组织起来了，每个互助小组就是劳动合作社，比如第五组都是翻身户，刚自岳阳逃难回来的难民，劳动情绪最高，全组二个铁匠、二个铜匠、四个条的工人、五个煤窑工人、二个轧花工人、三个笊篱工人、三个民兵，他们的互助变工办法，农业互助变工每工分五晌，每晌算一小工，一天五小工为一大工，欠下工还工资米五升，打下粮食归私人所有。手工业生产，扣除了每个工人的工资，扣二成的红利资本外，其余红利为小组公有“按劳分配”。最初是不论农业、副业、参战、一天算一工，后来改为农业按活计工，副业按件计工，织布一丈五算一工，一天能织三丈则算二工；运输小炉活不能按件计的副业，每日计工，赚多者以提奖办法抽红提奖余下归公。出差民夫、民兵的土地，工人的土地，完全有互助组解决，让他们安心参战和做工。
    全村有一个总合作社，专门是调用和帮助各小组搞生产，比如从银行贷来款，再分给各小合作社。总社榨油，油饼由各小组不出本钱担上下山。当时城里市价十五元一斤，总社按十二元一斤，卖给小合作社，到山王庄以后，按山下市价出售，赚了钱归小组；小组编好笊篱，总社负责运出去代卖，并代小组在外边收条丝，收原料。全村现在已经成了一座劳动互助的大工厂。
