　　Guantao Promotes Friendship, Diverts Water to Neighboring Villages; Mutual Assistance and Mutual Relief for Joint Drought Resistance; People in Chanfang and Maluo Villages are Moved to Irrigate Day and Night

　　The cadres and masses of Guantao in the Seventh District are promoting the spirit of friendship by uniting to struggle against landlords and achieve liberation, practicing mutual assistance and mutual relief with villages such as Chanfang and Maluo, and jointly fighting drought and overcoming famine. Most of the uncultivated land near the irrigation canal in Guantao Village has already been sown. Now, all fourteen mutual aid groups in the village are carrying water to distant lands for planting. However, the neighboring villages of Chanfang and Maluo are still parched, lacking even drinking water. This is because, in the past feudal society, the landlords in control would not allow water to be diverted there, so the masses there dared not even ask. One day, Zhang Guide, the political director of Guantao, said to District Cadre Zhang: "The masses have only just been liberated and are already encountering a drought. Our village has already planted some crops, but Chanfang and Maluo are in such a dire situation." Then, the two of them began to discuss it and finally proposed: "Farmers all over the world are one family; we should provide relief to them." Therefore, they convened a mass meeting in Guantao, explaining to the masses and recounting the spirit of unity and friendship from the mutual aid and self-rescue efforts to overcome famine and fight locusts in 1942 and 1943, as well as the united struggle against landlords. They also mobilized the people to help Chanfang and Maluo repair canals. Ma Junxiu and Fu Jintang said: "Our masses are all one family. People helped us before, and now we must help them repair canals and irrigate the land." The masses all agreed and said in unison: "Their difficulties are our sufferings. Planting one more mu means harvesting one more mu of grain, which is our strength." They then enthusiastically started working, quickly repairing a canal more than a li long, diverting water to Chanfang and Maluo. When the masses in those two villages saw this, they were extremely happy, almost moved to tears, saying: "How good this world is! This could not have happened in the past. This saves so many lives! The cadres and masses of Guantao are really good to us." The masses were irrigating and chatting, forgetting to eat and sleep, irrigating 120 mu of land in two days and two nights, and are still irrigating. For land that cannot be irrigated, carrying water is also closer. Their morale is very high, and their slogan is: "The power of farmers all over the world is great; unite to fight drought and strive for prosperity." This has broken the feudal barriers of thousands of years, and the masses are further moving towards mutual assistance and mutual relief. Now, the masses of Guantao are preparing to build a canal from Qishui Gully, to both operate a water mill and enable Yangyi to also irrigate the land. (Bing Cheng, Li Sheng)

　　管陶发扬友爱引水邻村
    互助互济联合抗旱
    禅房马洛两村人人感动日夜浇地
    【本报武安讯】七区管陶干群发扬联合斗争地主团结翻身的友爱精神，与禅房、马洛等村实行互助互济，联合抗旱渡荒。管陶村靠近水渠的大部白地已经下种了，现在全村十四个互助组正往远地担水点种，但邻村禅房、马洛，还是干巴巴的，甚至连吃的水也没有，这是因为过去在封建社会，地主们统治的不叫往那里引水，所以那里的群众也不敢要求。一天，管陶政治主任张贵德同志给区干部张同志说：“群众才翻了身就碰到个旱灾，咱村已种上了点，禅房、马洛两村干巴巴的多糟糕。”接着他俩便研究起来，最后提出了“天下农民是一家，咱们应该救济他。”于是便召开管陶群众大会，给群众解释，把四二、四三年的互助互救渡荒和打蝗，联合斗争地主等团结友爱精神叙述了一遍，又发动帮助禅房、马洛修渠。马俊秀、富金堂说：“咱群众都是一家人，以前人家救济咱，现在咱要帮助他们修渠浇地。”群众都认为对，异口同声的说：“他的困难就是咱的苦处，多种一亩就打一亩粮还是咱的力量。”便热火潮天的干起来，很快修了一里多长的渠子，把水引到禅房和马洛口去了。那两村群众一见，非常高兴，感动的几乎流出泪来，都说：“这世道有多好，过去可不能这样，这救多少命！管陶干部群众对咱实在好。”群众们连浇地带说笑，连饭也顾不得吃，觉也顾不得睡，两天两夜浇地一百二十亩，现还在浇着。有不能浇的，担水也近了，他们的情绪很高，口号是“天下农民力量大，联合抗旱闹发家。”这样打破了千年来的封建隔阂，群众进一步走向了互助互救。现在管陶群众正准备从奇水沟修渠，一面推水磨，一面使阳邑也能浇地。（秉诚、理生）
