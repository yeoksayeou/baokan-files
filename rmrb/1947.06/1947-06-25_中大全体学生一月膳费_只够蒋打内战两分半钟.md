Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. Shanghai and Ping news reported: A new "geometry" problem was published on the wall newspaper of National Central University in Nanjing, pointing out that the cost of two minutes and thirty-seven seconds of civil war is equal to the entire monthly food expenses of all students at National Central University. This year, the Jiang government's budget continues to be 20 trillion, but the actual expenditure is 60 trillion (according to past actual expenditures, which are often three times the budget). War expenses account for 80 percent, which is 48 trillion, that is, daily war expenses are 133.3 billion, and war expenses per minute are slightly over 91 million. War expenses for two minutes and thirty-seven seconds should be 238,500,000 yuan. The monthly food expenses for each student at National Central University are 53,000 yuan. Calculated with a total of 1,500 students, the monthly food expenses should be 238,500,000 yuan, which is equal to the war expenses for two minutes and thirty-seven seconds.

　　中大全体学生一月膳费
    只够蒋打内战两分半钟
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】沪平报载：南京中央大学墙报上载有一新“几何”题，指出二分三十七秒钟的内战费用，等于中大全体同学全月膳费。本年度蒋政府继预算为二十万亿，实际支出为六十万亿（按已往实际支出常为预算之三倍）。战费占百分之八十，则为四十八万亿，即每日战费一三三三亿，每分钟战费九千一百万强，二分三十七秒战费，应为二三八五○○○○○元。而中大同学每月每人膳费共五万三千元，以全体千五百人计，则每月膳费应为二三八五○○○○○元，与二分三十七秒钟的战费相等。
