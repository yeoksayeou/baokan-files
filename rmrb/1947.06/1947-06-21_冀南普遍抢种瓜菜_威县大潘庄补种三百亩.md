　　Jinnan Widely Rushes to Plant Melons and Vegetables
    Da Pan Village in Wei County Replants 300 Mu
    [Our Jinnan Dispatch, 19th] In order to prevent drought and famine, farmers in various regions are organizing all and semi-able-bodied laborers to rush to plant and carry out conservation campaigns. Da Jian Village in Qinghe Third District organized mutual aid teams with men, women, old and young, totaling 12 groups and more than 130 people, who all went out two days before wheat harvesting to plant corn and beans on more than 130 mu. The masses of Si Jiawu organized six wheat harvesting mutual aid groups and proposed that each person plant one-third of a mu of melons and vegetables before the wheat harvest. Wang Fugui, the deputy director of the Farmers' Association, opened more than one-third of a mu of barren land next to the fields in the afternoon and planted melons and vegetables. After the village chief group finished the meeting in the evening, they took advantage of the moonlight to dig eight ridges, and the liberated women of Du Village not only helped each other in spinning and weaving, but also challenged each other to do farm work. The women's association director, Wang Kunhai's group, opened seven-tenths of a mu of barren land in the afternoon, built ridges, and carried water to plant pumpkins and cowpeas. The honored soldier Du Shuangcheng did not ask the village to cultivate on his behalf, but worked hard to produce. He earned 60,000 yuan from making bricks this spring and actively participated in the rush planting. He also carried water to water the four mu of sorghum he had hoed. In terms of conservation, a mass movement has formed in the Third District. The organizations in Si Jiawu Village challenged each other. Village Chief Wang Yixin changed from eating rice to eating red sorghum mixed with chaff and vegetables, and completely quit smoking and drinking. Wang Yukun and other eight people at the exchange also changed from drinking, eating meat, and smoking cigarettes at every market to eating at home and not smoking cigarettes. The eight people can save 3,200 yuan per market. In Du Village, everyone in the village eats vegetables mixed with chaff. The leaves of elm trees, locust trees, and pear trees in the village have been picked clean. Ergeying and Shao Village seized the opportunity to rush to plant after the light rain on May 28 to eliminate bare land. Ergeying people and livestock voluntarily helped each other and temporarily organized more than 40 groups, rushing to plant more than 400 mu of cotton, beans, corn, etc. in one day, and opened up four-tenths of a mu of new wasteland to prepare for planting chard. Women in Shao Village organized four large groups and 20 small groups, reclaiming one mu and eight-tenths of a mu of wasteland to grow melons and vegetables. After the representatives of the Da Pan Village Farmers' Association in Wei County called for production and conservation at the general meeting of all members, the groups launched enthusiastic discussions. Director Jia said, "Everyone knows that I can smoke and drink, but from now on, I will resolutely not drink a drop of alcohol or smoke a single cigarette." They all proposed a competition challenge to quit smoking and drinking. Wang Gaokui's group challenged and said, "If there is anyone in our group who smokes or drinks, we will ask everyone to discuss the punishment." Before he finished speaking, the Changli group immediately responded. Under their influence, a wave of production and conservation has been launched in the village. At present, in addition to replanting 347 mu of missing seedlings, the village has also planted 56 mu of cotton. In order to save household expenses, primary schools in Qiu County have enthusiastically launched production and conservation competitions. Dong Guisheng, a teacher in Nanliu Village, led the students to discuss and formulate a production and conservation plan. Everyone unanimously agreed not to spend loose change, and whoever is the most thrifty will be considered one of the model conditions. The village has two mu of school farmland planted with winter melon. The primary school students in Yao Si Tou established four salt leaching mutual aid groups, a total of 18 people, who scrape salt soil every day at dawn, go to school to study when the sun comes out, push salt soil during game time, fill salt ponds, sleep together at night, and take turns watching the ponds and adding water. From May 10th to 25th, they leached a total of 550 jin of salt. In addition to solving the expenses for stationery and books, each student sent 25 jin of salt to their families, which the parents liked very much.
