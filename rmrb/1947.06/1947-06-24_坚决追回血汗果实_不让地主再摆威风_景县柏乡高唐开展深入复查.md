　　Resolutely Recover the Fruits of Blood and Sweat
    Never Let Landlords Display Their Power Again
    In-depth Review Launched in Jingxian, Baixiang, and Gaotang
    [Jinan News, Hebei, 22nd] Jingxian, Baixiang, and Gaotang are conducting in-depth reviews. At a cadre and member meeting in Qilizhuang, Sixth District of Jingxian, the conspiracy of landlord Lü Xique and others to numb the masses with petty favors was discovered. During group discussions, the places where the landlord hid things were investigated, and a thorough review movement was launched. The hidden items were quickly unearthed, piling up like a mountain. This proves that the large-scale and vigorous struggle in the village in the past was not thorough or meticulous. Many cadres and masses said with great indignation: "This time, those landlords with great crimes should be swept out of their homes!" Some masses said to the landlords: "The previous struggle was not thorough. You always put on the airs of landlords, eating well and dressing well, and not wanting to work. It's clear that you exploited much more of the poor people's blood and sweat!" In Qilizhuang, 140 out of 150 households have joined the Farmers' Association. The review has uncovered more than 100 rooms and more than 100 mu of land. The masses discussed how to deal with the landlords in this review: for general landlords, each person should be left with two mu of land; for widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless, about five mu should be left after careful consideration; and landlords with heinous crimes should be resolutely swept out of their homes. Many poor peasants said firmly: "Only when what is left to the landlords is no more than what the poor have can we be considered to have truly turned ourselves over." In Baixiang, the Gu Shangdian Village combined the review with the Great Production Movement. In this village, there had been two mass movements the previous year, but most of the masses were deceived by the landlords' tricks of pretending to be poor and failed to completely turn themselves over. The landlord Feng Qingyu only had part of his land struggled against. In order to deceive the masses, he pretended to be poor, asked his son to sell sesame cakes and black dates, and collected one dou of grain for each to show his poverty. Feng Yongzhi's mother was a close relative of his family. This year, when planting the land, she asked him for some seeds to exchange for beans, but he pretended to be poor and refused to exchange them. However, the masses understood from history that not much of his wealth had been exposed. Everyone agreed that "to solve the difficulties in production, we must resolutely review the landlords who have been liquidated." As a result, more than 20 large urns of grain and many pieces of cloth and clothing were uncovered from Feng Qingyu's family alone. The awareness of the deceived masses was greatly raised. Feng Yongzhi pointed at the landlord Feng Yuqing and scolded: "We are still close relatives, but you pretended to be poorer than me and refused to exchange seeds for me. Now that so much of your wealth has been uncovered, you eat the blood and sweat of the poor, you black-hearted ghost! Who is related to you!" A total of nine landlords were reviewed in the village, and more than 70 shi of grain, as well as many clothes, fabrics, and daily necessities, were uncovered. Eighty households, 144 people, who were short of grain, and 177 people who did not have enough grain to eat, all received grain. In the northeast gate of Gaotang, the masses discovered that the land planted by Zuo Fuxing belonged to the former puppet town head. After questioning, Zuo Fuxing was unable to justify himself and was at a loss for words, which proved that the land was dispersed to him by the puppet town head to evade land reform. The land was immediately confiscated, and a review was launched as a result. Deputy Street Chief Li Shiji reported two landlords who had evaded, and Farmers' Association Deputy Director Li Fengming investigated two landlords. The masses also actively participated in the review, and a total of seven landlords were uncovered, with 149 mu of land (including 47 mu of wheat land), as well as many pieces of clothing and grain.
    [Jinan News, Hebei, 22nd] In the new district of Gaotang, fierce struggles have been launched in 205 out of more than 400 large villages. The remaining small villages are brewing, and the mass movement in the new district is about to catch up with the situation in the old district of the county. According to incomplete statistics, 3,114 male members and 1,487 female members have been organized in the third and seventh districts, and 2,300 male and female members have been organized in the fourth district. With the support of the leadership, the masses in each district bravely struggled against the landlords. In the fourth district, Bai Miao overthrew the heinous landlord "Five Tigers," Zhi Fang overthrew the "Four Great Monsters," Hao Zhuang overthrew the "Little Military Expert," and Nan Dian and Gao Lou jointly overthrew the "Three-Day Grandpa" and three other evil and treacherous puppet village chiefs. At the struggle meeting in Shi Xiaozhuang, Eighth District, members carried hoes and red-tasseled spears, while the landlord shamelessly bribed the peasants with pork buns. The peasants said: "This is poison, we won't eat it. We only want the fruits of our struggle!" When the peasants from the Hehe District returned to the village from the struggle meeting, the landlords lined up to greet them and tried to offer courtesies to ease the struggle. The peasants shouted, "Down with the evil landlords, don't fall for the landlords' tricks!" According to preliminary statistics, in the third and fourth districts alone, 389 feudal bullies and landlords were overthrown, and 4,082 mu of land and many other items were recovered. The peasants' awareness has been raised, and they no longer believe in "fate." The summary of the celebration meeting for turning over in the third and fourth districts pointed out: "The large-scale situation has passed, but the struggle is not thorough. There are landlords who have slipped through the net. In the future, we will use the spirit of 'comparing land, comparing houses, comparing clothes, and comparing food' and 'thoroughly struggling against the landlords,' 'thoroughly explaining the principles,' and 'thoroughly turning over our bodies' to carry out the review."

　　坚决追回血汗果实
    不让地主再摆威风
    景县柏乡高唐开展深入复查
    【本报冀南二十二日电】景县、柏乡、高唐深入复查。景县六区七里庄在干部会员大会上发现地主吕希却等小恩小惠麻痹群众的阴谋，在分组讨论中，调查出地主隐藏东西的地方，遂进入彻底复查运动，东西很快搞出，堆积如山。这证明过去该村大规模轰轰烈烈的斗争是不彻底不细致的。很多干部和群众非常愤恨的说：“这回对那些罪恶大的地主应该给他个扫地出门”！有的群众向地主说：“过去斗的不彻底，你们总是摆着地主架子，吃好穿好，不想劳动，可见你们剥削穷人的血汗还多呢！”七里庄一百五十户人家，已有一百四十户参加农会，复查中又追出房子一百多间，地一百多亩，群众讨论这次复查处理地主的办法：对一般地主每人留二亩地，对鳏寡孤独的斟酌留五亩左右，对罪大恶极的地主坚决扫地出门。许多贫农很坚定的说：“只有给地主留的不超过穷人，那才算俺翻了身”。柏乡固商店在大生产运动中结合复查，该村去年两次群运，由于多数群众为地主装穷诡计所迷惑，未能翻透身，地主冯庆玉只斗出一部分土地，他为了蒙蔽群众，便装起穷来，叫他儿子去卖烧饼、卖黑枣，每一只收回一斗粮食以示穷困。冯勇志娘是他的近门本家，今年耩地时拿豆子向他换一点种籽，他竟装穷不换给，但是群众从历史上了解总感到没有斗出他多少东西，大家一致意见“要想解决生产困难，坚决复查被清算过的地主”。结果仅冯庆玉一家就清查出廿多大瓮粮食及许多布匹、衣服，被骗群众觉悟大大提高，冯勇志指着地主冯玉庆痛骂：“咱还是亲当家子，换你点种籽你装的比俺还穷，不换给，现在清算出你这样多东西，你吃穷人的血汗，黑心鬼！谁和你是当家子！”该村共复查地主九户，仅粮食查出七十多石，衣被、布匹、日用物品甚多。缺粮的八十户，一百四十四人，及粮食不够吃的一百七十七人都分到粮食。高唐东北关群众在抢种抢收中，发现左福兴种的地是过去伪镇长的，经质问后，左福兴理屈辞穷、言语支吾，遂证明该地是伪镇长逃避土地改革疏散给他的，即将该地没收，并由此展开复查，副街长李世吉报出逃避地主两户，农会副主任李凤鸣调查出两户地主，群众亦纷纷参加清查，前后共查出地主七户，土地一百四十九亩（内有小麦地四十七亩），另尚有衣物粮食等多件。
    【本报冀南二十二日电】高唐新区四百多村中已有二百零五个大村掀起猛烈斗争，其余小村，正在酝酿，新区群运将要赶上本县老区的状况。据不完全统计：三、七两区已组织起男会员三一一四人，女会员一四八七人，四区男女会员共二三○○人。各区群众得到领导上的撑腰，勇猛的向地主斗争，四区白庙打倒罪大恶极地主“五只虎”，纸房打倒“四大怪”，郝庄斗倒“小军事家”，南店、高楼联合斗倒“三天爷爷”伪大乡长等三户恶霸奸伪地主。八区石校庄斗争会上会员抗着镢和红缨枪，地主则无耻的贿给农民猪肉馒头，农民说：“这是毒药不吃，咱们斗出的果实才要哩”！涸河区上农民从斗争大会回村时，地主们排队打恭出迎，想献殷勤缓和斗争。农民高呼“打倒恶霸地主，不中地主诡计”！据初步统计，仅三、四两区，斗垮封建恶霸地主等三百八十九人，收回土地四○八二亩，及其他东西甚多。农民觉悟提高了，再不信什么“命运”。三、四区庆祝翻身大会总结中指出：“大动局面已过，但斗争未彻底，有漏网地主，今后以比地、比房、比穿、比吃“四比”，和“地主要斗透”，“理要说透”，“身要翻透”，“三透”的精神，贯彻复查。
