Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 27th: Lin Boqu, Chairman of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government, recently wrote an article titled "Achieving Meritorious Service to Support the Front Lines" in the Border Region Mass Daily, stating: In the great people's self-defense war to defend the border region and liberate Northwest China, tens of thousands of combat heroes have emerged in every victory. They have made immortal contributions to the revolutionary cause of people's liberation. In the rear, in order to guarantee victory at the front, the people of the border region have also begun to see some model deeds and heroic figures in wartime work such as stretchers, transportation, rescuing wounded soldiers, supplying food and grass, anti-espionage and eliminating traitors, as well as production and thrift, and land reform. However, compared with the combat achievements of the main forces at the front, they are still inferior, even failing to keep up with the needs of the war and lagging behind the development of the war. It must be understood that war is comprehensive, long-term, and arduous. To completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan bandit troops and achieve final victory, it is necessary to mobilize all manpower and material resources, everything for the war, everything for the front line, everyone achieving meritorious service, and everything achieving meritorious service. Regardless of the Party, government, military, or civilians, regardless of the front or the rear, regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone should establish merits in all positions for the masses, for freedom, for defending the border region, and for liberating Northwest China. Expand the meritorious service campaign into a mass upsurge, continue the model worker movement, organize and mobilize cadres and people to give play to their initiative and creativity in the struggle against the enemy. It is necessary to specifically organize them according to different work and different targets through the mass line, achieve meritorious service in joining the army, participating in the war, expanding the main force and rushing to the front line, achieve meritorious service in serving in war service stretcher transportation, achieve meritorious service in boiling water and cooking food, sewing clothes and making shoes for the combat troops, achieve meritorious service in increasing grain production and strictly implementing production to ensure supply, achieve meritorious service in implementing wartime land reform, achieve meritorious service in responding to all calls of the government and completing all tasks, and launch a mass upsurge of meritorious service, so that the majestic power of the people of the entire border region can support the front line with an overwhelming force in the meritorious service movement, until the final elimination of the enemy.

　　陕甘宁林伯渠主席撰文
    号召支援前线立功为解放西北而奋斗
    【新华社西北二十七日电】陕甘宁边区政府主席林伯渠顷以“为支援前线立功”为题，在边区群众报撰文称：在保卫边区、解放大西北的伟大人民自卫战争中，每次战斗的胜利，都涌现出成千成万的战斗英雄。为人民解放的革命事业立下了永垂不朽的功劳。在后方为了保证前方胜利，边区人民对担架、运输、救护伤兵、供应粮草、反特锄奸以及生产节约、土地改革等战时工作，也开始涌现出一些模范事迹和英雄人物。但与前方主力部队的作战功迹相较，则仍有逊色。甚至赶不上战争的需要，落在战争发展的后面。须知战争是全面的、长期的、艰苦的，要彻底消灭蒋胡贼军达到最后胜利，就必须动员所有人力、物力，一切为着战争，一切为着前线，人人立功，事事立功。不论党、政、军、民，不论前方后方，不论男女老幼在一切岗位上为大众，为自由，为保卫边区，为解放大西北建立功劳。把立功运动扩展成为群众性的热潮，为继续劳模运动，组织与动员干部及人民在对敌斗争中，发挥积极性创造性。要根据不同工作不同对象，经过群众路线具体组织他们，在参军参战扩大主力涌上前线中立功，在服务战勤担架运输中立功，在为作战部队烧水作饭缝衣做鞋中立功，在增产粮食厉行生产保证供给中立功，在实行战时土地改革中立功，在响应政府一切号召和完成一切任务中立功，掀起群众性的立功热潮，使全边区人民的雄伟力量，在立功运动中以排山倒海之势支援前线，一直到最后消灭敌人。
