　　Expanding the Liberated Areas
    New Methods Created by the People of Huaiyin
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 9th] "Wherever the ditches extend, the liberated area expands there." This is a new creation of the guerrilla forces in the Huaiyin border area of northern Jiangsu. After the great victory at Huji on the Huai(yin)-Shu(yang) road in mid-April, within three days, several ditches in the five-li area extended four and a half li southward (towards the KMT-occupied area), interconnected by a twenty-five li long transverse ditch. Guerrilla forces hid in the ditches and wheat fields, appearing and disappearing without a trace, and constantly striking at the KMT-puppet troops, ultimately completely squeezing out the KMT-puppet forces in the area. As the ditches continued to extend forward, the KMT Jianqiao, Dashu, and Tangfang township offices all fled to the west side of the Jianqiao stronghold on the Huai-Shu road, and the vast rural areas were restored.

　　扩大解放区
    淮阴群众创造新法
    【新华社华中九日电】“路沟伸展到那里，解放区扩大到那里”，这是苏北淮阴边缘区游击队的新创造。四月中旬，淮（阴）沭（阳）路胡集大捷后，三天内，五里区数条路沟向南（蒋占区）齐头伸展四里半，中间以二十五里长的横沟连贯，游击队隐伏路沟麦浪里。来去无踪，随时打击蒋伪军，终将该区蒋伪势力完全挤走。由于路沟不断向前伸展，蒋记涧桥、大树、糖坊等乡公所都流亡到淮沭路涧桥据点公路西侧，广大农村均告恢复。
