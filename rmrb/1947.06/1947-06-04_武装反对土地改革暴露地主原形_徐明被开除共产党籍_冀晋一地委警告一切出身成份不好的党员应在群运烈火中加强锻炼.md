[News from this newspaper] According to the Jinchaji Daily on the 15th of last month, the Jiji No. 1 Prefectural Committee recently issued a decision on expelling Xu Ming from the Party. Xu Ming’s family was a landlord family, and his father was a local tyrant. He was from Cailiang Village, Sixth District, Wan County. This year, the masses in the village rose up to settle accounts with his family, and Xu held a grudge after hearing about it. At the time, Xu was working in Hunyuan, and soon used the excuse of going home, but in reality, he attempted revenge. On March ×, Xu shot and killed Wang Shangren, a leader of the emancipated peasants in the village. The village guerrilla squad and a platoon from the military station went to arrest him, but the traitor Xu Ming refused arrest and resisted with arms. It took about an hour to apprehend him. The instruction pointed out the reasons for Xu Ming's betrayal of the Party and its seriousness, stating: Although Xu Ming was only 25 years old and joined the Party as early as 1939, having held the important position of Director of the Datong Military Affairs Committee, he should have become a strong Party member through the Party's long-term education and training. Unexpectedly, when the Party's rent reduction policy transitioned into the current land reform, he not only failed to withstand the test, exposing his true landlord position, but also stood on the landlord's position, armed against the farmers' land reform, carrying out a serious betrayal of the Party, destroying Party discipline, directly helping the enemy, and causing irreparable losses to the Party. In order to strictly enforce Party discipline, consolidate the Party's ties with the masses, and resolutely safeguard the dignity of the Party's land reform policy, it was decided to expel Xu Ming from the Party and hand him over to the government for severe punishment according to law. The instruction finally warned the whole Party: The occurrence of Xu Ming's problem is by no means accidental. This is a reflection of the sharp class struggle outside the Party within the Party. All comrades with unfavorable class backgrounds should be extremely vigilant, bravely throw themselves into this historic struggle, resolutely support the interests of the peasants, humbly learn in the fiery furnace of the mass movement, and strengthen the cultivation of Party spirit.

    【本报讯】据上月十五日晋察冀日报称：冀晋一地委顷颁发关于开除徐明党籍的决定。按徐明家系地主，父亲是恶霸，完县六区才良村人。今年该村群众起来清算了他家，徐听到后怀恨在心。当时徐正在浑源工作，不久即借口回家实则企图报复。三月×日徐将该村翻身领袖王尚仁用枪打死。村里游击小组及兵站一个班前往逮捕，该叛徒徐明竟拒绝逮捕，实行武装抗击，约一小时始就捕。指示指出：徐明叛党原因及其严重性称：徐明年虽二十五岁，并于一九三九年即入党，曾任大同武委会主任之要职，经过党的长期教育培养理应成为坚强党员。讵料当党的减租主张转入目前的土地改革中时，他不但经受不起考验，暴露了地主立场的原形，而且竟站在地主立场武装反对农民的土地改革实行了，对党的严重叛变，破坏了党纪，直接帮助了敌人，给党造成不可补救之损失。为严整党纪，巩固党与群众的联系，坚决维护党的土地改革政策之尊严，特决定开除徐明党籍；并交政府依法严处。该指示最后警告全党称：徐明问题的发生绝非偶然，这是一种党外尖锐阶级斗争在党内的反映。一切出身成份不好的同志都该万分警惕，勇敢的投入这一历史性的斗争中去，坚决拥护农民的利益，在群众运动的烈火中虚心学习，加强党性的锻炼。
