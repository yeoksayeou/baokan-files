Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th. Comprehensive report: A huge treasonous conspiracy case led by former Prime Minister Nagy has been cracked in Hungary. The Hungarian government has now successfully completed its reorganization, and the people's democratic forces have achieved a major victory. The anti-republican conspiracy case cracked by the Hungarian National Public Security Agency has been tried by the People's Court since March. A series of confessions by the defendants have revealed that: the remaining Hungarian fascists, combined with a portion of the anti-democratic elements in the upper and middle levels of the ruling Smallholders Party, under the instructions and support of foreign intelligence agencies, were hiding in various departments of the state, using their positions to contact the Hungarian fascist army stationed in the British-occupied zone of Austria, establish a rebellious military organization, and sabotage important democratic measures, attempting to throw the country's political and economic situation into chaos, and to scout the deployment of Soviet troops stationed in Hungary, along with information on industrial and mining conditions and airport locations, to supply foreign intelligence agencies, in an attempt to overthrow the republic and restore reactionary rule after the Soviet troops withdrew from Hungarian territory, and to form a government in exile in a foreign country at an appropriate time. At the same time, Béla Kovács, the former General Secretary of the Smallholders Party, who was interrogated by the Soviet judicial authorities of the Allied Control Commission in Hungary, confessed that former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy was the leader of the rebellion, and Béla Varga, Speaker of the National Assembly, was also one of the leaders (both belonged to the Smallholders Party); and revealed that Nagy maintained contact with Hungarian reactionaries in Washington. According to Austrian newspapers, Nagy also maintained contact with "senior American personnel" in Switzerland. After obtaining evidence from the Soviet side, the Hungarian Council of Ministers decided on May 28 to ask Nagy, who was on vacation in Switzerland, to return to the country. Nagy resigned out of fear of punishment, Varga fled to Austria, and Hungarian Police Chief Goma Rom尼斯 has been arrested. The Hungarian government carried out a reorganization on the 31st, with Defense Minister Dinnyés (democratic faction of the Smallholders Party) concurrently serving as Prime Minister. In order to eliminate anti-democratic elements in the parliament, elections may be held again. At the same time, the Smallholders Party has decided to expel former party chairman Nagy and Varga and will conduct a thorough cleansing within the party. At this point, the government crisis caused by the conspirators was resolved. When inspecting the border guards on June 1, the new Prime Minister Dinnyés delivered a speech explaining the new government's domestic and foreign policies: internally, to consolidate democracy, implement the three-year economic plan, and improve the living standards of the working people; externally, to coexist peacefully with all democratic countries in the world, and to cooperate peacefully with major powers such as Britain and the United States, especially neighboring Soviet Union. Deputy Prime Minister Rákosi declared: The Communist Party trusts the new Prime Minister; and said: The rapid resolution of the crisis proves the strength of Hungarian democratic forces. At the same time, the new chairman of the Smallholders Party also told the press: "I want the workers' parties to believe in our loyalty to democracy." (Note: In addition to the Smallholders Party, the Hungarian coalition government consists of the Social Democratic Party, the Communist Party, and the National Peasant Party, which form the left-wing alliance. The Smallholders Party is also known as the Small Farmers Party and holds a leading position in the Farmers' Alliance—a mass organization of farmers.)

    破获巨大叛国阴谋
    政府顺利完成改组
    【新华社陕北七日电】综合报导：匈牙利破获以前总理奈基为首领的巨大的叛国阴谋案，匈政府顷已顺利完成改组，人民民主力量获得重大胜利。匈牙利国家公安机关所破获的反共和国阴谋案，自三月间起即由人民法庭审判，一连串被告的口供都泄露出：匈牙利法西斯残余结合执政的小地主党的上中层一部分反民主分子，在外国情报机关的指使与支持下，隐藏在国家的各种部门中，利用职位，与留驻在奥境英占领区的匈牙利法西斯军队联系，建立谋叛的军事机构，并破坏重要民主措施，图使国家政治与经济情势陷于混乱，并侦察驻匈苏军的部署，连同工矿情况及飞机场位置等情报，供给外国情报机关，企图在占领苏军撤离匈境后，推翻共和国，恢复反动统治，并图于适当时机在外国成立流亡政府。同时，驻匈盟国管制委员会苏联司法当局所审讯的前小地主党总书记拜拉·科瓦克供认：匈前总理奈基即系谋叛的首领，而国民议会议长拜拉·法尔加亦系首领之一（二人均属小地主党）；并泄露奈基与在华盛顿的匈反动派保有联系。另据奥国报载：奈基在瑞士与“美国高级人员”亦保有联系。匈部长会议自苏方获得证据后，于五月二十八日决议要求正在瑞士休假的奈基回国，奈基畏罪辞职，法尔加逃往奥国，匈警察总监哥马罗尼斯已被逮捕。匈政府当于三十一日进行改组，由国防部长丁尼斯（小地主党民主派）兼任总理。为清除国会中的反民主分子，或将重新举行选举。同时小地主党已决定开除该党前主席奈基及法尔加，并将在党内进行彻底清洗。至此，阴谋分子所造成的政府危机遂告解决。新总理丁尼斯于六月一日检阅边防军时发表演说，说明新政府之内政外交政策，对内巩固民主、执行三年经济计划，提高劳动人民生活水平。对外与世界各民主国和平共居，与各大强国如英美特别是邻国苏联和平合作。副总理拉可希宣称：共产党信任新总理；并称：危机的迅速解决证明匈牙利民主力量的强大。同时小地主党新主席亦对报界表示：“我愿意工人阶级各政党相信我们对民主的忠诚。”（按：匈牙利联合政府中除小地主党外，有社会民主党、共产党、全国农民党三党所组成的左翼联盟。小地主党亦名小农党，在农民联盟——农民的群众组织——中居领导地位。）
