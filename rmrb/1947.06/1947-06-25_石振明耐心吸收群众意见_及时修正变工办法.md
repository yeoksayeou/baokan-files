　　[This newspaper's Taiyue 23rd dispatch] This year, under the personal leadership of old heroes Shi Zhenming, Zhao Meiying, and Zhao Rongzhi, the Shi Zhenming Mutual Aid United Brigade and the Fancun Brigade created new methods for mutual aid labor exchange, achieving fairness and reasonableness. This spring, the first and second "lü" (a measurement unit) of the village were unable to form mutual aid groups. Shi Zhenming personally conducted an investigation and discovered that the cattle of the Lü Taiming brothers in Bijia Gully were unwilling to participate in mutual aid, claiming that it was more work than not participating. In reality, they were afraid that the livestock would be overworked after being organized and were unwilling to combine with households without livestock. Secondly, some people did not pay wages in the past, and some lost their work tickets, making it difficult to settle accounts, which affected the rectification of the mutual aid groups. After understanding these situations, they researched the following methods: (1) The number of points for cattle labor exchange was increased. Plowing one "mu" of flat land earned one work point and one "sheng" of feed, while plowing one "mu" of sloping land earned 0.7 work points and 1.5 "sheng" of feed. This made it beneficial for cattle owners, who were then willing to cooperate with households without cattle. Regarding wages, in the past, the wage was three "sheng" of rice per work point regardless of whether it was a busy or slack season. Now, it is generally increased to four "sheng," and it is revised every two months according to the agricultural season. Past wage arrears were cleared up, and wages were paid based on labor results. For example, if Wang Daoyi and five others only planted half a "mu" of hemp in one day, they were only paid for 2.5 work points. Regarding work tickets, they were issued to individuals in the past, but now they are issued to the group leader through the cooperative, which prevents losses and avoids the phenomenon of non-payment of wages in the past. The principle of equivalent exchange must be thoroughly implemented and adhered to, and accounts must be settled at any time, not just relying on goodwill. (2) New innovations were also made in the combination of production and participation in war. In the past, participating in war earned 0.2 more work points than production. On the surface, it seemed to favor those participating in the war, but in reality, some backward elements became less enthusiastic about production as a result. For example, Wang Daoyi and five others only planted half a "mu" of hemp in one day, and Shang Tai and thirty others only hoed six "mu" of corn in one day, which instead put those participating in the war at a disadvantage. Therefore, it was changed so that participating in war and production earned the same number of work points. Transportation was awarded progressively more work points based on weight, such as carrying one "shi" and four "dou" of rice earning ten points, and one "shi" and five "dou" of rice earning twelve points, encouraging more carrying and saving labor. (3) Regarding the combination of production and preferential treatment for military dependents, the organization's assistance to military dependents' production was poor in the past, focusing only on preferential treatment, which inevitably wasted labor. This year, all labor that can be organized into the production front is organized, and the amount of labor required for each military dependent is specifically calculated, and work tickets are issued uniformly. In addition, the number of preferential treatment days that each person should bear is determined based on the situation. This both promotes the labor force of military dependents, allowing them to use others' preferential treatment only when necessary, and reduces the waste of preferential treatment labor. (4) Small merchants and handicraft workers are also organized to participate in the war. Handicraft workers should also be assigned to support the war effort, but those who do not go can exchange labor with farmers. The village's nine blacksmiths and carpenters used to charge 1.5 "dou" of rice to repair a hoe and two "dou" of rice to make a hoe. Now, it is one work point (four "sheng" of rice) to repair a hoe and two work points (eight "sheng" of rice) to make a hoe. If calculated by time, such as repairing four hoes and making two hoes a day, they can still earn more than one "dou" of rice, which is better than going to the front line to support the war effort. And it is also very appropriate for farmers who used to need 1.5 "dou" of rice to repair a hoe, but now only need four "sheng" of rice. Carpenters earn six "sheng" of rice per work point and also get meals. Small merchants are organized based on their production methods, mainly what they rely on. For example, those who are half farmer and half merchant are assigned to half of the war support effort and nearby support. Due to the resolution of the above problems, the production enthusiasm of the masses in the village is very high, and competitions are being carried out among the teams.

　　石振明耐心吸收群众意见
    及时修正变工办法
    【本报太岳廿三日电】石振明互助联合大队，范村大队，今年在老英雄石振明、赵美英、赵荣智等亲自领导下，创造了新的互助变工办法，做到公平合理。该村一二闾今年春耕时互助组搞不起来，石振明即亲自进行调查，发现比家沟吕台明兄弟二人的牛不愿互助，说互助起来还不如不互助作的多，实际却是怕牲口组织起来后使得太累，不愿和无牲口的人结合。其次是过去有些人不开工资，有的把工票遗失后算不清账，互相影响了互助组的整顿，了解了这些情况之后，他们便研究了如下的一些办法：（一）提高了牛变人工的分数，犁平地一亩顶一工给一升料，犁坡地七分顶一工，一升半料，这样使牛主有利，才肯与无牛户合作。关于工资，过去是不分季节忙闲，一工订工资米三升，现在一般提高为四升，再根据农时季节两月改订一次，过去拖欠工资的作一清理，根据劳动效果开工资，如王道义五人一天种了半亩大麻，便只按二分半工给开工资，工票问题过去是发给个人，现在通过合作社发给组长掌握，这就可以不致损失。并可随时拿去向合作社兑粮，以免过去不给工资的现象。对于等价交换的原则必须贯彻坚持，随时算账，不能光凭涵厚办事。（二）生产与参战的结合也有新的创造，过去参战一工比生产一工多顶二分，表面上好像是优待了参战的人，但实际上有些落后分子便因此生产不起劲，如王道义五人一天只种了半亩大麻，尚太三十人一天只锄了六亩玉茭，反使参战的人吃了亏，因此又改作不管参战与生产一工顶一工。运输按重量累进多顶工，如担运一石四斗米顶十分，一石五斗米顶十二分，鼓励多担，节省劳力。（三）在生产与优抗的结合上，过去对组织帮助军属生产较差，只偏重了优待，这样不免有些浪费劳力；今年把凡能组织到生产战线上的劳力都组织进来，具体计算，每个军属需工多少，统一发给工票，另外再根据情况决定每人应负担之优待天数，这样既发扬军属的劳动力，使其在不得已时才用别人优待，又减少优待工的浪费。（四）对一般小商人与手工业者也组织起来参战，手工业者也应支差，但不去支差者可与农民变工。该村九户铁匠与木匠，过去是修一把＠头斗半米，打一把＠头二斗米，现在是一把顶一工，（四升米）打一把顶两个工，（八升米），若以时间计，如每天能修四把＠头，打两把＠头，还可赚一斗多米，比去前方支差强的多，而农民过去修一把需米斗半，今天需米四升也很合适。木匠一工顶六升还管饭。小商人则看其生产方式主要靠什么，如半农半商者，则支半差与近差。由于解决了上述问题，故该村群众生产情绪十分高涨，各队间并开展相互竞赛。
