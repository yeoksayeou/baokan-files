　　Lin County Pingshun Rectifies Village Finances, Clears Out Large Quantities of Stockpiled Materials
　　[Report from our Lin County office] Lin County convened a meeting of financial and grain warehouses to summarize the work of clearing warehouses, clearing inventories, and clearing accounts during this period. According to statistics from 239 villages in ten districts, a total of over 200,000 catties of rice, wheat, and horse feed were cleared out, along with over 90,000 yuan.
　　In addition, over 2,000 pairs of military shoes, over 3,000 catties of cotton, and items such as bullets and gunpowder were cleared out, some of which were materials that had been stored for six or seven years, or even ten years, without anyone paying attention to them. In summarizing this work, it was particularly emphasized that financial and grain cadres must learn to manage assets, serve the masses, and be responsible for the hard work of the masses. At the meeting, Li Xingzhong, Li Xuechang, and Xu Peiguo were selected as models, and each was awarded 1,000 yuan and notebooks, towels, etc.

　　[Report from our Pingshun office] From early April to the end of May, the first district of Pingshun thoroughly rectified village finances in thirty villages, clearing out 298,495 catties of millet, wheat, corn, grain, and miscellaneous grains from the charity granaries. In addition, 146 rooms, 342 trees, and 98.4 mu of public land were cleared out. 6,395 pieces of communal property were cleared out. To turn dead economy into a living economy, each village sold unused old properties and public assets, plus the old funds and public land rent grain cleared out, totaling 4,239,479 yuan and 48,172 catties of millet. This year, the district's teachers' salaries, village expenses, education funds, armed forces expenses, and production bonuses require a total of 100,8429 catties of millet. If the above-mentioned rectified materials are put into production, earning one catty of millet for every catty of millet, and one yuan for every yuan, then it can earn 48,172 catties of millet and 4,239,479 yuan, which can be converted to 118,829 catties of millet. After expenses, there is a surplus of 10,400 catties. It can completely achieve self-sufficiency in production.

　　[Another Report] In order to thoroughly rectify village finances, the Second District convened a meeting of village cadres on the 22nd of last month to summarize past experiences and achievements. Seventeen villages cleared out over 30,000 catties of millet, 980,000 yuan, and coarse grains, clothing, etc. Li Zhengshui and two others were selected as models for rectifying village finances. The Seventh District also convened a meeting on the 23rd to classify all districts into three types of villages for rectification, and established merit conditions for the work. Everyone is determined to thoroughly clear and rectify in order to reduce the burden on the people.
　　(Ke Ping, Han Jie, Hai Xing)
　　[Report from our Changzhi office] At a joint meeting of the district party committee and district heads, the county magistrate of Changzhi County called on everyone to practice strict economy, return every bit to the public, increase wealth, and reduce the burden on the people in order to support the self-defense war. Comrade Wang Yushan was the first to report ten coffins he knew were scattered in various villages and returned them to the public. The Third District also reported 40 taels of silver ingots, one six-shooter, six dan of grain, 30,000 yuan in iron money, one cow, and a bookcase and dressing mirror stored and returned them to the public. The First District reported 90 shi of grain, two bolts of foreign cloth, donkeys, mules, carts, and silver dollars. Niu District also turned in his wristwatch and gave it to the public; then the Fifth and Fourth Districts successively reported the number of clothing and grain items and handed them over to the public in full. District Chief Guo also saved his monthly allowance of six catties of rice and four pairs of shoes for the year and used it to support the front line. The county magistrate Ren decided to reward this spirit of returning every bit to the public and being responsible for the revolution.

    另外清理出军鞋二千余双、棉花三千余斤，及子弹火药等其中有保存六七年甚至十年无人过问的物资。在总结这段工作中，特别强调提出：财粮干部要学会管理家当，为群众服务，要对群众的血汗负责。会上评选出李兴中、李学昌、徐培国三同志为模范，每人奖洋一千元及笔记本、毛巾等。

    【本报平顺讯】平顺一区于四月初到五月底，三十个村彻底整顿村财政，清出义仓小米、麦子、玉茭、谷子及杂粮二十九万八千四九十五斤。另清出房百四十六间，树木三百四十二棵，公地九十八亩四分。社物六千三百九十五件，为把死经济变成活经济，各村变卖不用之旧物公产，加上清出之旧款及公地租粮共合洋四百二十三万九千四百七十九元，小米四万八千一百七十二斤。今年全区教员薪金、村费、教育经费、武装开支生产奖金共需小米十万零八千四百二十九斤。若将以上整顿的物资投入生产，一斤米赚一斤米，一元钱赚一元钱的话，则能赚米四万八千一百七十二斤，钱四百二十三万九千四百七十九元，可折米十一万八千八百二十九斤。除支出外，尚余一万零四百斤。完全能做到生产自给。
