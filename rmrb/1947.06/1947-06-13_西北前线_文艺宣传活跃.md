　　Northwest Front
    Active Literary and Artistic Propaganda
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 11th] Literary and artistic propaganda on the Northwest Front is extremely active. The magic lantern group of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Literary Association is rushing to paint magic lantern slides and write lyrics day and night. They have already created five sets of magic lantern shows, including "Gao Yanxi Kills the Enemy," "Capturing the Puppet County Magistrate Alive," and stories of the atrocities of the Chiang-Hu army. They perform for the soldiers during marching breaks on the front lines. One group in the rear performed seven times in a single day for a certain unit. Soldiers and the masses alike welcomed the performances, and some even watched five performances in a row, still reluctant to leave. The lyrics of the magic lantern shows have already spread among the masses. The People's Theater Troupe has also appeared on the front lines. During the Yangma River battle, the troupe members participated in the work of transporting the wounded, which was highly praised by all sides. After the Yangma River battle, the troupe immediately performed to comfort the soldiers, and the play "Defend Peace" was particularly praised by the soldiers and liberated soldiers. The Northwest Literary and Art Troupe has also been divided into groups to go deep into the troops and rural areas before and after the Self-Defense War. They personally participated in local work, collected practical materials to write scripts, and performed. For example, "Guo Shuan Suffers Disaster," which focuses on opposing pessimism and disappointment, has achieved very good performance results. It not only eliminated the panic and unease of some of the masses due to their lack of understanding of current affairs, but also prompted some of the masses to return home to engage in production. The Longdong Theater Troupe also directly went deep into the troops to read newspapers to the soldiers, talk about current affairs, and tell stories. When they arrived in the guerrilla teams, they became political workers of the guerrilla teams, actively engaged in various propaganda and educational work.

　　西北前线
    文艺宣传活跃
    【新华社西北十一日电】西北前线文艺宣传极活跃。陕甘宁边区文协洋片组，在行军中日夜赶画洋片，编写唱词，已创作出五套洋片。内有《高彦喜杀敌》、《活捉伪县长》以及蒋胡军暴行等，在前方即利用行军休息时间，给战士演唱。在后方的一组，单在某部一日即演出七次。战士、群众均表欢迎，甚至有连看五场仍恋恋不舍者。洋片唱词已在群众中流传。民众剧团亦在前线出现。羊马河战斗时，剧团人员并参加转运伤员工作，颇受各方称许。羊马河战斗后，该团立即演出，慰问战士，《保卫和平》一剧尤为战士及解放兵所称道。西北文艺工作团在自卫战争前后，亦已分组深入部队与农村。他们亲身参加地方工作，收集实际材料编写剧本演出。如以反对悲观失望为主题之《郭拴遭祸》，演出效果甚好。不但消除了部分群众因不了解时事而产生的恐慌不安心情，并使若干群众纷纷回家生产。陇东剧团并直接深入部队给战士读报，讲时事，说书。到了游击队即成为游击队之政工人员。积极从事各种宣传教育工作。
