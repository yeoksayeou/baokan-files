Taiyue Front, June 8th (From Our Newspaper) – During the Jinan Campaign, over 50,000 people followed the troops in battle across the Fen River Plain, resulting in a large number of war merit heroes. In Shimin, there were 192, in Yangcheng, 52, in Gaoping, 87, and in Jincheng, 21. Twenty-two cadres also earned the title of war merit hero. They faced death on the front lines, demonstrating the high level of consciousness of the people in the liberated areas. The Shimin war support team helped the troops dig fortifications. Due to time constraints and a lack of tools, some even used their bare hands to replace tools. They didn't slacken even when their fingernails broke, considering it an honor. After the campaign, the various units presented banners and other souvenirs.

Taiyue Front, June 8th (From Our Newspaper) – Reporter Ai Bo at the Jinan Front reports: A stretcher-bearer platoon of the People's Liberation Army valiantly rescued the wounded on the front lines. The entire platoon was commended and awarded a banner for "Meritorious Rescue." When formulating their plan to defend Chairman Mao and achieve merit, the platoon proposed the slogan "Live and die with the wounded." They thoroughly realized this determination in the recent campaign. Regardless of the intensity of the battle, the comrades of the stretcher-bearer platoon bravely advanced, rescuing the wounded under enemy fire. During the Yuncheng Airport battle, platoon leader Chang Zhengwu, only about 100 meters from the enemy's pillbox, rushed to rescue nine wounded soldiers under intense enemy machine-gun fire. As he carried back the first wounded soldier, the fire was too intense, and others told him to wait. However, to reduce the suffering of the wounded, he went again. On his third trip, he was wounded himself, but he insisted on staying on the front lines to help with registration. Stretcher-bearer Niu Shurong, in a certain battle, was only fifty or sixty meters from the enemy's pillbox. Enemy shells exploded continuously around him, but when he saw a wounded soldier there, he desperately rescued him. At first, he wanted to use a bamboo pole to pull the wounded soldier across the road, then carry him away. However, after pulling several times without success, he unhesitatingly crossed the road and carried the wounded soldier back. They often neglected to eat to rescue the wounded. In one battle, when food was delivered from the rear, stretcher-bearers Che Fuzheng and Zhang Laibao were carrying a wounded soldier back from the front. Everyone asked them to eat, but they only took two rice balls and went back to the front. The platoon rescued a total of forty-one wounded soldiers in two battles, and more than half of the platoon members received commendations.

Taiyue Front, June 8th (From Our Newspaper) – During the Jinan Campaign, the frontline units treated civilian laborers like brothers. When crossing the Fen River at night, Director He of a certain regiment stood on the bank, caring for the civilian laborers crossing the river, personally pulling them ashore one by one. Comrade Liu Zizhong of the supply department of a certain regiment cared for the civilian laborers on the front lines, helping them dig fortifications and air-raid shelters, and guiding them on how to avoid aircraft. Comrade Zhang Shiyan led the civilian laborers with utmost care. Upon discovering an aircraft, he disregarded the danger and ran back and forth to instruct the civilian laborers to take cover. Comrade Li Anmin personally checked to ensure the civilian laborers were properly covered with their quilts at night, fearing they might get sick. Furthermore, they were given material comforts. A certain unit distributed 1,500 sets of captured clothing, 30 sacks of flour, and 1,500 towels to the civilian laborers, along with 18 jin of salt per person. Another unit gave the civilian laborers 1,515 shoes and socks, 61,100 Jichaopiao, 392,000 legal tender, 2,200 jin of salt, 5,912 jin of grain, 700 jin of vermicelli, and 1,034 jin of pork. In a certain unit, the civilian laborers ate five jin of meat each over two months, and others ate at least two jin, and the civilian laborers' lives were quite good. After the campaign, the units presented banners and comfort items to the selected war merit heroes and models. In a certain unit, the special-grade war support model was awarded a new set of single-layer clothing and a towel, and each district and county cadre was awarded a set of shirts. When the war support masses returned, the brigades and regiments all gave them a farewell. Brigade Commander Zhou specially poured wine for the civilian laborers to see them off, and led the troops to escort them for more than ten li.

　　太岳五万群众随军转战两月
    出现大批参战功臣
    晋南部队爱护民夫亲如兄弟
    【本报太岳前线八日电】晋南战役中，五万以上群众跟随部队转战汾河平原，涌现了大批功臣。士敏有一百九十二位，阳城有五十二位，高平有八十七位，晋城有二十一位。干部获得功臣称号者，有二十二位。他们在前线出生入死，表现了解放区人民高度觉悟。士敏参战队帮助部队挖工事，因时间紧迫，工具缺少，有用自己双手来代替工具的。甚至将指甲挖破亦毫不松懈，认为这是光荣。战役结束后，各部队纷纷赠送锦旗等纪念品。
    【本报太岳前线八日电】晋南前线记者艾柏报导：人民解放军某部担架排，在火线上奋勇抢救伤员，全排立功，荣获了“抢救有功”的奖旗。该排在订立保卫毛主席立功计划时，即提出“与伤员共存亡”的口号，此次战役中彻底实现了这个决心。无论在任何激烈战斗的场合下，担架排的同志都奋勇向前，冒着敌人的炮火去抢救伤员。班长常正武在运城机场战斗中，离敌人碉堡仅一百多米达，在敌人机枪猛烈扫射下，冲去抢救九个伤员。当他抢下第一个伤员时，火力太激烈了，别人叫他停一会再去，可是为了减少伤员的痛苦，他又去了。在第三次背回伤员时，他自己负了伤，但他仍坚持不下火线，进行帮助登记工作。担架员牛树荣在某次战斗中，离敌人碉堡仅五六十米，敌人炮弹不断在周围爆炸，但他看到那里有一个彩号，就拚命去抢救了出来。起先他想用一根竹竿把伤员拉过路这边来，然后背上走，但拉了几次没拉过来，他就毫不犹豫的过路那面把彩号背了下来。为了抢救伤员，他们常常顾不上吃饭。在某次战斗中，后面送去了饭，担架员车讣正、张来保正从前面抬彩号回来，大家叫他们吃饭，他们只拿了两个米团又到前面去了。该排在两次战斗中，共抢救了四十一个伤员，全排有半数以上的人记了功。
    【本报太岳前线八日电】晋南战役中，前线各部队爱护民夫亲如兄弟。当夜渡汾河时，某团何主任站在岸上照料民夫过河，亲手把一个个的拉上岸来。某团供给处刘子忠同志在火线上照料民夫挖工事和防空洞，指导民夫怎样躲避飞机。张世炎同志带领民夫，关心备至。发现飞机后不顾危险的跑来跑去招呼民夫隐蔽。李安民同志晚上怕民夫得病，亲自检查民夫盖好被子。此外，更给以物资上的慰劳，某部分给民夫胜利品衣服一千五百套，洋面袋三十个，毛巾一千五百条，盐每人十八斤。又某部给民夫鞋袜一千五百一十五件，冀钞六万一千一百元，法币三十九万二千元，盐二千二百斤，粮食五千九百十二斤，粉条七百斤，猪肉一千零三十四斤，纸烟十四条。在某部的民夫，两个月来吃肉五斤，其他至少吃二斤，民夫生活相当好。战役结束后，各部队对选出之参战功臣模范，纷纷赠给锦旗和慰劳品。在某部的特等参战模范，奖给新单衣一套，毛巾一条，区县干部每人衬衣一套。在参战群众返回时，各旅团纷纷欢送，周旅长特给民夫斟酒送行，并带部队远送十余里。
