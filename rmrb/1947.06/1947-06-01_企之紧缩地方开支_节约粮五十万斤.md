　　Qi County Tightens Local Spending, Saving 500,000 Jin of Grain
    [Our newspaper, Jinnan, 30th dispatch] Qi County has tightened local grain expenditure, saving 500,000 jin, which has been sent to the front lines. Of this, 100,000 jin was saved from education grain. The method is to strictly examine the quality of teachers: reduce the salaries for Grade A and Grade B teachers. In order to support the front lines and ensure war supplies, teachers have also voluntarily saved. Guo Zifen, a Grade A teacher in Mazhuang, District One, voluntarily changed to receiving Grade B supply. 50,000 jin was also saved from preferential treatment grain for families of soldiers, through strict examination according to the preferential treatment system. 350,000 jin was saved from village grain use: kerosene fees for militia were reduced from the original 30-60 jin per month to 6 jin. Village administrative expenses were reduced from the original three grades of 30 jin, 40 jin, and 60 jin per month to 15 jin and 20 jin respectively. Kerosene for primary schools was reduced from 15 jin per month to 5 jin. Village cadre meetings are not expensed. The 500,000 jin of grain has now been milled and sent to the front lines.
    [Our newspaper, Huguan News] All the cadres in the Sixth District are from worker-peasant backgrounds. They are practical and responsible in their work. Responding to the Party's call for production and conservation, they resolutely and conscientiously promote the essence of coming from the workers and peasants and returning to the workers and peasants. In addition to their work, everyone actively participates in production movements. Comrade Duan Zhangchen carries a load of coal every time he comes to the district office for a meeting, and has already earned more than 2,000 yuan. On May 15th, the county held a district cadre meeting. When they came, each person carried a carrying pole, and when they left, each person carried a load of bowls (more than 60 jin per load), earning more than 4,000 yuan per load. They completed their own production tasks and were able to solve the difficulties of the masses. The masses reflected that these are truly good cadres for the people.
