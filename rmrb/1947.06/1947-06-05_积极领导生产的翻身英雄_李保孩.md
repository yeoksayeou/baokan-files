　　Actively Leading Production: A Liberated Hero
    Li Baohai
    Bai Guilin
            How He Became a Liberated Hero
    Shoutou Village, in the Second District of Heshun, used to be a village where feudal rule was at its worst. The whole village had 83 households with 2,230 mu of land. The landlord Zhang Xiaoshan occupied 1,600 mu, so there were more farm laborers and the very poor in this village than in other villages.

    Li Baohai came to Shoutou Village from Pingding during the famine in the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920). He was sixteen years old when he arrived. He is now forty-four years old, and has been a hired laborer for twenty-three years. After Heshun City was liberated in 1945, he became the director of the Farmers' Association. At first, he still had some ideas about "where his conscience lay," and on September 25th, he even offered half a catty of meat to the mountain god. But on the third day, wolves almost ate his brother. From then on, he stopped being superstitious. After speaking out about his sufferings, he became even more aware and told everyone, "The Eighth Route Army saved me with grain. Superstition is useless!" He united twelve young people and destroyed all the idols one night. Without the oppression of "gods," the villagers no longer talked about "conscience" and dared to fight the landlords. Li Baohai understood that his twenty-three years of hunger were caused by the landlords, and he became resentful, wanting to do something about it. He first colluded with three hired laborers, who then colluded with twelve others, all with great enthusiasm and willing to fight the landlords immediately. Feeling that their strength was still not enough, he also found the poor peasant woman Fang Aizhi, who brought along more than a dozen female activists. In this way, from small to large, 52 of the 83 households in the village were united. With more people, they were bolder and had greater plans. The enraged peasants killed the blood-sucking landlord, dug out silver dollars, took out their belongings, and distributed 1,600 mu of good land to the basic masses, giving each poor household half a fat cow. Take Fang Xiaolong, for example. He was the poorest household in the village. His family of three received 22 mu of land and six rooms. During the distribution of fruits of victory, some cadres said that they should distribute more to themselves, but Baohai was very upright and discussed with everyone, "Don't stand out, or others will criticize us!" Last year, when various places filled in gaps and returned excess fruits of victory, the cadres all said, "It's good to listen to Baohai, otherwise we would have to strip naked and wash our faces!" Leading the masses to liberate themselves, the masses supported him. Leading the general cadres without going astray, the cadres were happy. Therefore, at last year's Hero Conference, Li Baohai was publicly elected as a liberated hero.

            As Long as You Think of a Way, Leading Production Isn't Difficult
    After liberation, Li Baohai became the political director. At that time, the higher authorities put forward the call for large-scale production. In his mind, he felt that it was not as easy to lead as liberation - liberation was about gaining benefits, while mutual aid was about suffering. But after attending the county's production mobilization meeting and listening to the experiences of various places, he understood. He thought: Wasn't it difficult at the beginning of liberation? But as long as we do it, we will succeed. Chairman Mao's plans, no matter what we do, are all for the sake of us, the common people. As long as we are willing to use our brains and discuss it in meetings, there will definitely be a way. So he held a Farmers' Association meeting to discuss last year's mutual aid production. At the meeting, Zhang Baofu said, "Last year, participation in mutual aid was not very voluntary. The ticket distribution was too large, and we lost a lot of money. We couldn't pay the wages owed and didn't dare to say much." He seized on these problems and decided that this year, whoever wanted to cooperate with whom could freely combine. The ticket was changed to two and a half points, so there was no loss in finding change. Wages were settled seasonally. Everyone said, "This is almost right!" They immediately put forward the slogan: "A clumsy bird flies early, we should start preparing seeds early!"

    A man named Qiao wanted to participate in mutual aid, but was afraid that his family would not have enough food. Baohai borrowed two shi and six dou of grain from the public grain collection for the lean year, so that he could concentrate on production. Another man, Li Xiaocheng, didn't move in the spring and owed people four dou of rice in wages. He also asked for relief. Baohai said to him, "Will you work this year or not? If you work, you definitely won't owe anything. If you don't work, I don't care if you starve to death next year." Li Xiaocheng had a good time in the second stage. As a result, in addition to paying off the owed grain, others owed him one sheng of rice.

            Educate the Masses with Practice, Organize the Whole Village
    He wanted to organize everyone in the village. Some people, after talking, joined mutual aid; but some people just wouldn't listen. Gouhai said, "I don't do less work alone. In total, I have ten mu of land, and it will take me ten days to plant it." A few days later, an inspection showed that the ten mu of land cultivated by Baohai's mutual aid group had been planted in four days, but Gouhai had only completed half of it.

    There was also Zhang Maohai, who was still sleeping in the pit when the villagers went to the fields early in the morning. He hired people for spring plowing, paid five dou of wages, and couldn't afford it, so he went to Baohai. Baohai said to him, "As long as you participate in mutual aid, there will be a way." This man still wouldn't listen. When it came time to plant millet, no one would cooperate with him. He went to the landlord, but the landlord was afraid that the masses would raise objections and refused to help him. He went to Baohai again and said, "I don't mind working for others for two days if they give me one day in return." Baohai said, "As long as you tell everyone what's in your heart, you don't have to work two days for one." Later, the first group approved his joining the group, and he was taught a lesson. In addition to paying off the five dou of grain, there were still seven sheng that hadn't been paid off. When he joined the army, the mutual aid group didn't ask him to pay it back. In this way, the whole village was organized.

            Save Labor to Develop Sideline Occupations
    Because of being organized to rush the work, they quickly finished planting. The nearby Xiazhuang Village, because it was not organized, was too busy to plant and wanted Baohai to lead the mutual aid group to help them with a few days of shock work. He agreed, but didn't know if the group would agree. He first proposed in the group: "Our mutual aid group not only wants to save labor, but also has to think of ways to earn some money." Everyone said, "No one will hire us!" Seeing that everyone agreed, he boldly told them about helping Xiazhuang with the shock work, and everyone agreed. The next day, he led fifty people to Xiazhuang and earned seven thousand yuan a day.

    Some people advocated dividing the money they earned. Baohai said: "If we divide the money, it will be wasted. Let's buy pigs with the group's money. We'll have pocket money and meat to eat during the New Year." So they bought three sows, which gave birth to two litters. Now the old sows still belong to the whole group, and everyone has already received five pigs. He also proposed to the whole group: "We want to reach twenty-five pigs by the end of the year and prepare to exchange them for mules to engage in transportation." Everyone thought it was a good idea and scrambled to raise pigs. Now there are seventy-two pigs in the whole village.

            Participate in War and Production Without Neglecting Either
    The whole village had just been organized when, on April 27th, they received an order to participate in the war from the County Armed Forces Committee. He was very calm. The next afternoon, the people participating in the war were about to depart. After breakfast, he called on the young and middle-aged laborers to go to the fields to plant millet. He returned to the village and held a meeting of the Women's Federation, mobilizing the women to quickly prepare shoes, dry food, and make good meals. That morning, the whole village rushed to plant 230 mu of millet. After lunch, he gathered everyone to hold a meeting and explained the matter of participating in the war. Seeing that many people were leaving, everyone was worried that they would not be able to plant. Li Baohai led everyone to discuss a solution: plant in stages. Dioscorea, spring wheat, and black beans in one stage, millet in one stage, naked oats and sorghum in one stage. All the labor in the village was used in a unified manner.

    When mobilizing the children at first, the adults at home said, "If we ask the children to go to the fields, we have to specially send someone to guard against wolves!" Baohai first let eight children go together to clear five mu in half a day. After discussion, everyone's thinking was straightened out. Those from thirteen to fifteen years old were worth seven points, those from eleven to twelve years old were worth five points, and then points were awarded according to the work done. Older children joined mutual aid groups, and younger children were led by teachers. Women activists Bai Xiaoni and Fang Aizi each led one or two women to the fields. Under this influence, 52 of the 62 female laborers in the village went to the fields to plant millet and plant seeds. Eight old men also went to the fields. Work tickets were used in a unified manner, and no one suffered losses. Because of doing this, all 2,154 mu of sowing were completed within half a month by May 15th.

    In order to encourage everyone to make contributions to production, Baohai made a red flag and asked the elementary school teacher to praise them on the public blackboard every day.

    Everyone wanted to win the red flag. Fang Aizi and Bai Xiaoni volunteered to grind nine hundred catties of white flour for the army without using male labor, and they carried it to the district in two days. Women wanted to stand guard, and old men were willing to deliver letters, all competing to make contributions. Zhang Fubao's wife said that she would get up early every day to sweep the streets, sweeping 160 loads of manure in a month. Baohai seized on this point and launched a discussion among the women. Now everyone in the village is competing to sweep the streets.

    Baohai said that this year he wants to achieve "cultivating one and saving one," and properly organize the village's production so that the production of the whole village is done very well. Because he can always think of ways for the masses and solve their difficulties, now the people in this village go to him when they have something to do, and the people in the neighboring villages also go to him. Therefore, he has won the support and love of the broad masses.

　　积极领导生产的翻身英雄
    李保孩
    白桂林
            怎样当了翻身英雄
    和顺二区梳头村，过去是封建统治最厉害的村子。全村八十三户，有地二千二百三十亩。地主张小山就占了一千六百亩，因此这个村里的农工、赤贫是比较别村多的。
    李保孩是在民国九年从平定逃荒来梳头村的。来时是十六岁，今年他四十四岁了，整整当了二十三年的雇工。四五年和顺城解放后，他担任农会主任，起初还有些“良心何在”的思想，九月二十五还割了半斤肉供献山神；可是第三天狼就几乎把他兄弟吃了，从此他才不再迷信了。经过诉苦，才更觉悟起来，到处给人说：“八路军是拿粮食救活我的，迷信不顶事！”他团结了十二个青年，一晚上把神像全部捣毁了。村里人没有了“神”的压制，也就不再讲什么“良心”，敢起来和地主斗一下了。李保孩懂得二十三年来的饿肚是地主给的，就忿恨起来，想干一场。他又自己先串通了三个雇工，由三个雇工又串通了十二个人，都劲头很大，愿意马上打地主。他感觉力量还不大，又找了赤贫妇女房爱枝，又带起十几个妇女积极分子来。这样由小到大，全村八十三户就团结了五十二户。人多胆大计划高，激愤的农民，打死了喝他们血的地主，刨出白洋，拿出包袱，把一千六百亩好地分给基本群众，每户穷人半条肥牛。拿房小龙来说吧，他是这村最穷的户，三口人分到了二十二亩地，房六间。在分配果实的时候，有的干部说咱们应当多分些，可是保孩很正直，同大家讨论说：“不要突出，让别人堵住咱们的嘴！”去年各地填平补齐退多得果实时，干部们都说：“听保孩的话真好，不然还得脱裤洗脸哩！”领导群众翻了身，群众拥护；领导一般干部没走错路，干部欢喜；因此李保孩在去年的群英会上，被大家公选为翻身英雄。
            只要想办法，领导生产也不难
    翻身以后，李保孩担任政治主任。当时上边提出了大生产，他的思想上感觉，不如翻身好领导，——翻身是得利，互助是受苦。可是参加了县生产动员会后，听听各地的经验，才想通了。他想：开始翻身何尝不觉难，可是只要干也成功了。毛主席的计划，不论做什么，都是为咱老百姓的。只要自己肯用脑筋，大家开会商量，一定会有办法。于是就开了个农会，讨论起去年的互助生产来。会上，张保福说：“去年参加互助有些不自动，分票的分太大，里找外找吃亏不小。欠的工资给不了，也不敢多说。”他抓住这些毛病，决定了今年谁愿与谁互助可以自由结合。分票改印成二分五的，零找不吃亏。工资按季节清算。大家说：“这一下可差不多了！”马上又提出口号：“笨鸟先飞，应该早动手养种！”
    有一位姓乔的想参加互助，可是怕家里粮食不够吃，保孩从防歉年公集粮里拿二石六斗借给他，让他安心生产。另有个李小成，春天不动弹欠下了人家四斗工资米，也提出要救济。保孩就对他说：“你今年劳动不劳动？如果你劳动一定没外欠；你如果不劳动，明年饿死也不管你。”李小成到第二阶段就好好受了一场。结果除把欠粮还清外，别人倒欠了他一升米。
            用实际教育群众，全村组织起来
    他要把全村的人都组织起来。有的经过谈话，就互助起来了；有个别的却偏不听话。狗孩说：“我一个人也不少做活。共总有十亩地，有十天就能下种进去。”过几天一检查，保孩们互助耕种的十亩地，四天就下种完了，可是狗孩却只完成一半。
    还有张毛孩，村里人早上了地，他还在坑里睡着。雇人春耕，出了五斗工资，无法开支，去找保孩。保孩对他说：“只要你参加互助，就有办法。”这人仍不听。到种谷时没人和他互助，又去找地主，地主怕群众提意见，不肯帮他。他又去找保孩说：“我那怕给别人动弹两天，别人还我一天，也可以。”保孩说：“只要你对大家说说心里话，用不着你二工顶一工。”后来第一组批准他加入组，受了一段。除还了五斗粮外，还有七升没还清。在他参战走时互助组就不要他还了，这样子，全村才都组织起来了。
            省出工来发展副业
    由于组织起来赶工，很快地就种完了。附近的下庄村因为没有组织起来，下种忙不过来，想让保孩带领互助组帮忙突击几天。他应承了，可是还不知组里是否同意。他首先在组里提出：“咱们互助组里，不光只要省出工来，还得要想办法赚些钱。”大家说：“没人用咱啊！”他看见大家都同意了，才大胆的说出帮下庄突击的事，大家都同意了。第二天他领了五十人去下庄，一天赚了七千元。
    赚下的钱，有人主张分了。保孩说：分了钱就浪费了，咱们就按组来买成猪吧。过年时有零花钱还有肉吃。”于是买了三口母猪，生了二窝。现在老母猪还是整个组里的，而每人已经分回五口猪了。他又向全组提出：“赶年关要达到二十五口猪，准备换成毛驴搞运输。大家一看是办法，都争养猪，现在全村已有七十二口猪。
            参战生产两不误
    全村刚刚组织起来，四月二十七号，接到县武委会的参战命令。他非常镇静。第二天下午参战的人就要出发，早饭后，他叫青壮年劳动力，去地里种谷。他返回村来，开了个全体妇救会，动员了妇女赶快准备鞋子、干粮，做些好饭。一上午全村突击了二百三十亩谷。午饭后，召集了全体开会把参战的事说明了。大家见人走得多，都担心种不进。李保孩领着大家讨论出办法来，分阶段种。山药、春麦、黑豆一段，谷一段，莜麦黍子一段。全村劳力统一使用。
    开始动员儿童时，家里的大人们说：“叫儿童上地，还得专误个人给打狼哩！”保孩先让八个儿童一同去，半天搭茬五亩。大家一讨论，这才打通思想，十三岁到十五岁的顶七分，十一到十二岁的顶五分，再按做活评分。大儿童加入互助组，小儿童由教员带领。妇女积极分子白小妮，房爱子，各领一两个妇女上地，在这样影响下，全村六十二个女劳力就有五十二个妇女上地种谷溜籽。八个老汉也都上地了。都是统一使用工票，谁也不吃亏。由于这样做在五月十五号半月内，全部完成下种二千一百五十四亩。
    为了鼓励大家生产立功，保孩做了一面红旗，又请小学教员每天在大众黑板上表扬。
    大家都想夺红旗。房爱子、白小妮情愿不用男劳力给军队磨白面九百斤，两天就担起送到区上。妇女要站岗，老汉愿送信，都争着立功。张福保女人说要每天早起扫街，一月扫了一百六十担粪。保孩抓住这点，在妇女中展开讨论。现在全村都争着扫街。
    保孩说我今年要达到耕一余一，并好好组织村里的生产，使全村的生产都搞得很好。由于他处处能为群众想办法，解决群众的困难，现在本村人有事就去找他，邻村人也去找他，因此在广大的群众中获得了拥护和爱戴。
