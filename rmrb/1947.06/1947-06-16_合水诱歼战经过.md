Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, June 14th: On May 30th, just as dawn broke, a part of Ma Bufang's 8th Cavalry Brigade, sent to reinforce Heishui, swaggered into Dachuanli, a suburb of Heishui City, attempting to join forces with the besieged troops inside the city. A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army, which had been lying in wait, suddenly launched an unexpected blocking attack. The enemy cavalry was immediately thrown into chaos. They left a small force to cover their retreat, while the rest quickly climbed the opposite mountain, fleeing towards Qingyang, abandoning more than 300 horses. The People's Liberation Army, with a fierce assault, crushed the stubborn enemy covering force and closely pursued the fleeing enemy climbing the mountain. The artillery accurately bombarded the dense cavalry ranks, further throwing the enemy into disarray. More than ten enemy cavalrymen, unable to control their horses while fleeing at full speed, fell one after another into deep pits and died. Many warhorses also fled for their lives under the artillery fire, but they all fell into the hands of the People's Liberation Army one by one. In just the time it takes to eat breakfast, Chiang Kai-shek's army under Ma Bufang suffered a preliminary blow. On the river滩, only a few miles long, more than fifty dead and dying warhorses lay scattered, along with scattered sabers and ammunition. The People's Liberation Army soldiers, riding tall and large Qinghai horses, marched back in lines, filling another long mountain path. One soldier waved a gleaming saber in his hand and said with a grin, "Hu Zongnan sent us American guns and cannons, and now Ma Bufang has sent us Qinghai warhorses, this time we are even better equipped."

Along with the liberation of more than 240 warhorses, dozens of Ma Bufang's soldiers were also liberated. One of them, named Zhang Huairu, a Han Chinese, was a young peasant in Qinghai a year ago and was captured last year to serve as a cavalryman. However, before he had learned to ride, he was transferred to attack the east. This time he was wounded, and several People's Liberation Army soldiers comforted him. After listening to the People's Liberation Army soldiers' explanation of the self-defense war and the policy on prisoners, he threw his "sesame cake hat" into the wheat field in disgust, saying, "I will never wear it again." Another one, named Wang Taimin, enlisted in the army in 1934 and has been a veteran for more than ten years. When he heard that his fourth company deputy commander had been killed, he repeatedly said, "Good riddance!" He told everyone, "That guy was extremely bad, he loved to beat and scold the soldiers. The brothers all hated him." Before long, the pursuing troops returned, and this battle of entrapment and annihilation also came to a victorious end.

　　合水诱歼战经过
    【新华社陕北前线十四日电】五月三十日天刚亮，增援合水的马步芳部骑八旅一部，大摇大摆的到了合水城郊的大川里；企图与城内被围部队会合。早已布置好的西北人民解放军一部，这时出敌不意突然予以堵击。敌骑立刻混乱了，他们留下少数兵力作掩护，其余的赶紧爬上对面的山，向庆阳方向逃窜，有三百多匹马也丢掉了。解放军以猛烈的攻击，打垮了顽强的敌人掩护部队，紧紧追击正在爬山逃窜的敌人。炮兵正确的轰击着密集的骑兵群，敌人是更加混乱。有十多名敌骑在飞驰逃奔时勒不住马，一个跟着一个跌死在深坑里。还有不少战马在炮火下各自逃命，但都一一落到了解放军手里。在仅仅一顿早餐的时间里，蒋军马步芳部尝到了一个初步打击。在战地上不过几里长的河滩上，躺着五十多匹已死和将死的战马，到处散乱着马刀和弹药。解放军的战士们骑在又高又大的青海马上，一队一队的往回走，摆满了另一条长长的山坡小道。一个战士手里挥着闪光的马刀，嘻嘻的说：“胡宗南给我们送来了美国枪炮，现在马步芳又给我们送来了青海战马，这回可装备得更美了。”
    和二百四十余匹战马同时解放的，还有几十战马步芳的士兵。有一个名叫张怀如的汉民，一年前他还是青海的一个青年农民，去年被抓来当骑兵。可是他还没有学会骑术，就被调来进攻以东。这次他受伤了，有几个解放军战士在慰问他。他听了解放军战士对于自卫战争与俘虏政策的解释，把那顶“烧饼帽”抛到麦地里憎恶的说：“我再不戴他了。”另一个名叫王泰民，他是民国二十三年入伍的，他已经是十几年的老兵了。当他听到他那第四连副连长被打死时，连声说：“打的好。”他向大家说：“这家伙顶坏，专爱打骂当兵的。弟兄们个个恨他。”不一会，追击的部队回来了，这次诱歼战也胜利地结束了。
