　　Liberation of Xiangling Battle
    Our Army Annihilates Over a Thousand Enemies
    [Xinhua News Agency, Southern Shanxi-Hebei-Henan Border Region, 7th] In the battle to liberate Xiangling on the 4th, the defending enemy, the remnants of the 49th Regiment of the 17th Brigade of the Kuomintang's 38th Division, and over 1,200 men of the puppet Xiangling "Love the Homeland Corps" were completely annihilated. It is estimated that over 200 enemies were killed or wounded, and over 800 people, including Guan Zhichao, the deputy regimental commander of the 49th Regiment, were captured. One mortar, two heavy machine guns, over thirty light machine guns, over seven hundred rifles, one 60mm mortar, and one radio station were seized. On the same day, in the morning, an enemy regiment from the 30th Division, which had come from Linfen to provide reinforcements, advanced to the vicinity of Shangxiajincun and Dongguan Licun villages east of the city and was also repelled by our forces.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, 8th] This agency's special correspondent, Mu Xin, reported on the Battle of the Liberation of Xiangling, stating: At 6:40 a.m. on the 4th, the general assault began. Cannon fire thundered, and Xiangling was shrouded in thick smoke. The enemy guarding the south gate, hidden in strong fortifications, attempted to resist stubbornly. Courageous artillerymen and engineers immediately blasted the city gate and the blocking sand and stones into the air. At the sound of the charge, warriors of the 409th Unit braved the enemy's dense fire and rushed into the city through the breach. Combat mutual aid group leader Zheng Yulin and the seven soldiers of the seventh squad of the ninth company quickly occupied the city tower, capturing 24 enemies, seizing 26 rifles, three light machine guns, and one grenade launcher. The offensive expanded from the ring city to both wings, and the enemies scurried like ants on a hot pot. At this time, the 407th Unit also crushed the stubborn resistance of the Hu clique and entered through the east gate, quickly clearing the entire city in just 15 minutes. Groups of ragged prisoners filled the streets, and the liberated citizens came out of their homes with smiling faces. The morning sun shone all over the city, and the whistling of gunfire gradually subsided. The fleeing remnants of the enemy in the eastern suburbs were caught one by one in the wheat fields like panting hares.

    【新华社晋绥八日电】本社特派记者穆欣报导解放襄陵之战称：四日晨六时四十分钟总攻开始，排炮雷鸣，襄陵全城笼罩在浓烟硝雾中，隐藏在坚强工事里的南门守敌，妄图顽抗了。神勇的山炮手和工兵，立将城门和堵塞的沙石炸得乱飞。冲锋号下，四○九部队勇士们冒敌人密集火力，从缺口扑入城内。战斗互助组长郑玉林为首的九连第七班七个战士，迅即占领了城楼，俘敌二十四名，缴步枪二十六支，轻机枪三挺，掷弹筒一个。攻势环城向两翼扩展，敌人像热锅上的蚂蚁，东滚西窜。此时四○七部队亦粉碎胡顽抵抗，由东门攻入，仅十五分钟即将全城肃清。衣衫褴褛的俘虏群，充塞了街头，解放了的市民带着满脸笑容，开门出来。朝阳普照全城，枪弹的啸声渐趋稀疏。溃逃东郊的残敌，在麦田里像喘息的野兔逐一落网。
