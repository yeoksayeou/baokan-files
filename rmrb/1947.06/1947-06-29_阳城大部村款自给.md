[This article was] Transmitted from Taiyue on the 27th by our newspaper: Most villages in Yangcheng are self-sufficient in village funds. In June, various districts successively convened meetings of village cadres on production and frugality. The village head of Xiye Village in the Second District was the first to declare that he would not eat public grain from June onwards, and organized all village cadres to participate in mutual aid to solve village expenses. Under his influence, village heads of Jianghe, Guhe and other villages all reported that they would cancel all public expenses from June onwards. The village head of Madidi Village in the Sixth District announced his plan for self-sufficiency in production, which aroused heated discussions among all village cadres, and they proposed mutual competition. Except for four village heads in the Seventh District who were from other districts and had no production base yet and could not be self-sufficient for the time being, all the remaining nineteen villages were completely self-sufficient in production. It is estimated that the entire district can reduce the people's burden by 68 shi and 7 dou of millet per year. The handicraft industry in the First District is relatively developed, and it is generally not difficult for villages to be self-sufficient. At present, only a few villages in the county have difficult conditions and cannot be self-sufficient, while all others are completely self-sufficient.

　　阳城大部村款自给
    【本报太岳二十七日电】阳城大部村款自给，六月间各区先后召开村干部生产节约会议，二区西冶村村长首先声明从六月份起自己不吃公粮，并组织所有村干部参加互助，解决村中经费，在他的影响之下，江河、古河等村村长皆自报从六月份起取消一切公费，六区麻地村村长宣布了他的生产自给计划后，引起了全体村干部的热烈讨论，并提出互相竞赛，七区村干部除四个村长是外区人，生产还无基础，暂不能自给外，其余十九个村全部生产自给，估计全区一年可减轻人民负担六十八石七斗小米。一区手工业较发达，一般村款自给无大困难，现全县只有少数村子条件困难不能自给，其他都已全部自给。
