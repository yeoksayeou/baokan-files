　　【This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch of the 25th】After the liberation of Xiangling County, democratic regimes have been established in all seventy-plus villages in the Fenxi area. The city walls, fortifications, and bunkers left behind by the Chiang-Yan troops have been completely demolished. During the Chiang-Yan rule, the county suffered from heavy and exorbitant taxes, causing a large number of people to flee and land to be abandoned. According to investigations in Wu'ai and Hebei villages alone, over 2,500 mu of the original 4,000-plus mu of land were abandoned, and over 30 of the original 80 households had fled. The masses said, "Yan Xishan is like running an oil press, trying to squeeze oil out of dry bones." The day after liberation, the democratic government distributed all 180 shi of grain stored in the enemy's warehouses to the farmers. The masses recognized that the Eighth Route Army were their saviors, joyfully saying, "The Eighth Route Brothers are really good, even if they come three times a day, it's not too much." An old man named Jia Han said, "If you had come a few days later, I would have burned the wheat and fled to the liberated area with my whole family." Now, many people who had fled have heard that their hometown has been liberated and are returning one after another. Fifty-plus households have already returned to Jia Han, and the village leader has organized militia. They say, "Old Chiang is gone, but Little Chiang will still come. We must start arming ourselves to defend our homes."

　　汾西七十余村民主政权建立
    【本报太岳二十五日电】襄陵县城解放后，汾西地区七十余村民主政权全部建立。蒋阎军遗留的城垣工事碉堡已全部平毁。该县在蒋阎统治时苛税奇重，人民大部逃亡，土地荒芜，仅据无姨、河北两村调查，原有土地四千余亩，荒芜者达二千五百余亩，原有八十户人家，逃亡者有三十余户，群众都说：“阎锡山是开油房的，干骨头也要榨出油。”解放后第二天，民主政府即将敌仓库所存一百八十石粮食全部分给农民，群众认识了八路军是自己的救命人，欢腾着说：“八路哥真不错，一天来三回也不多。”贾罕一老汉说：“你们迟来几天，我就准备把麦子一把火烧掉，全家逃到解放区。”现有许多逃亡的人，听到家乡解放，已纷纷回返。贾罕现已回来五十多户，庄头已组织起民兵，他们说：“老蒋打走了还要打小蒋哩，开始武装保卫家乡。”
