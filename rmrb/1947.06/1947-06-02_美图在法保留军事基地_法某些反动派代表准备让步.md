　　US Troops Retain Military Bases in France
　　Some Reactionary Representatives in France Prepare to Concede
　　(Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st) TASS, London: Newspapers here continue to report on the negotiations between US and French representatives regarding the withdrawal of US troops from France and its territories. The negotiations began in mid-April and have not yet reached a concrete agreement. As is well known, US armed forces entered the territories of many Allied countries, including France and its territories, to resist Hitler's Germany and its vassal states. Despite the fact that the war ended two years ago, and the continued presence of foreign troops in Allied territory can no longer be justified, the network of American airfields and military bases established in these areas still exists. Well-informed journalists assert that as early as the end of 1946, when the United Nations discussed the issue of Allied troops stationed in foreign territories, French politicians demanded the withdrawal of American troops from French overseas territories. It is believed here that the United States is prepared to withdraw troops still stationed in mainland France, but insists on obtaining the right of US troops to pass through France to the US-occupied zone of Germany. Under this pretext, the United States is attempting to retain naval and air bases in Marseille. During the negotiations, the US representatives stubbornly avoided the issue of withdrawing American armed forces from bases in French overseas territories. Journalists believe that the United States is attempting to retain some military bases and ports in French Guiana, New Caledonia, Africa, and the Grande Terre island area. France insists that the United States withdraw its troops from all French territory and opposes retaining bases in mainland France. At the same time, it is noteworthy that some French representatives participating in the negotiations are preparing to make concessions due to the proposed US financial assistance.

　　美图在法保留军事基地
    法某些反动派代表准备让步
    【新华社陕北三十一日电】据塔斯社伦敦讯：此间报纸连续报导关于美法代表商谈美军自法国及其属地撤退问题。谈判系于四月中旬开始，迄今尚未获致具体协议。众所周知，为了抗击希特勒德国及其附庸国，美国武装部队曾开入许多盟国的领土内，其中包括法国及其属地。尽管事实上战争结束已经两年，而且外国军队继续停留在盟国领土内已不能用任何理由来辩护，但在上述各地建立起来的美国飞机场与军事基地网至今仍然存在。消息灵通的新闻记者们确言，远在一九四六年底联合国机构讨论盟国军队驻留外国领土问题时，法国政界人士即要求美国军队从法国海外属地撤退。此间人士认为，美国已准备撤退仍留法国本部领土内的军队，但坚持必须获得美军经法国到德国美占领区之通行权。在这一借口下，美国企图保留在马赛的海空军基地。在谈判过程中，美国代表固执的躲避关于撤退法国海外属地上基地之美国武装部队的问题。新闻界人士相信，美国企图在法属圭亚那、新喀里多尼亚岛、非洲及大赫的岛区域内保留一些军事基地与港口。法国坚持美国军队撤出法国一切领土并反对在法国本部保留基地。同时值得注意的，参与谈判的某些法国代表们因为拟议中的美国财政援助而是在准备让步的。
