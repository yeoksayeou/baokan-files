　　Landlord Qiao Wanbang Regrets and Returns
    Painful Account of His Miserable Life in Exile in Anyang
    Ke Gang
    [Our newspaper's Henan-North Front, 29th dispatch] Our newspaper's reporter, Ke Gang, reports: According to Qiao Wanbang, a landlord who fled from Daming and returned from Anyang, the Chiang Kai-shek troops in Anyang city have lost their fighting spirit, and the people are panicking. Since the People's Liberation Army successively annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek 2nd Rapid Column and captured Sun Dianying alive, the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and residents in the city feel that Anyang is about to be liberated. The 40th Division has suffered heavy casualties and is now forcibly dispersing and supplementing the "Homecoming Corps" from Guantai and other places into the unit. The remnants of the puppet bandits Wang Ziquan and Guo Qing are blocked outside the city, and each person is given six liang of millet by the 40th Division every day. Soldiers have eaten all the leaves on the trees near the fortifications, as well as raw barley. When asked about the living conditions of the landlords who fled to Anyang city, Qiao Wanbang repeatedly shook his head and said sadly, "They are now at their wit's end. Those who arrived earlier could enter the city, and those who arrived later are crammed into the four gates. Regardless of whether they are inside or outside the city, the local people refuse to let them live in their houses. Some people forcibly occupy civilian houses but are driven out by the owners. In the end, they have to build small reed mats themselves by the streets and alleys, and the whole family huddles inside all day long. Food and drink are too expensive. No one sells millet even at 10,000 yuan a jin. Many people have sold the clothes and jewelry they brought with them to buy food, but they still cannot make a living, so they are forced to sell their own women. In the middle of the night, one official comes to sit, and another official comes to lie down." Speaking to this point, Qiao Wanbang sighed deeply and said indignantly, "People have faces, and trees have bark! We can't do such shameful things. After I slaughtered and ate my two yellow oxen, I realized the truth about Chiang Kai-shek. In the past, we were all fooled by them. In the Liberated Area, no matter what, there is always enough to eat and wear, and you don't have to sell your own woman's body. I am determined to follow the Eighth Route Army from now on." At this point, Qiao Wanbang was in tears, full of remorse. Our government personnel immediately sent him back to his hometown.

　　地主桥万邦悔悟归来
    痛述流亡安阳的悲惨生活
    柯岗
    【本报豫北前线二十九日电】本报记者柯岗报导：据自安阳归来之大名逃亡地主桥万邦称：安阳城内蒋军已无斗志，人心惶惶。自人民解放军先后歼灭蒋军第二快速纵队、生擒孙殿英后，蒋军士兵和城内居民均感安阳要解放。四十师因伤亡惨重，近日正强迫把观台等地“还乡团”编散补充该部。伪匪王自全、郭清残部，则被阻于城外，每天每人由四十师发给小米六两，士兵把工事附近的树叶和生大麦均已吃光。当记者问到逃至安阳城内的地主生活状况时，桥万邦连连摇头，非常伤心的说：“他们如今已经走头无路了，早来的还能进城，晚来的都挤在四关。不管城里城外，当地老百姓都不叫住房子，有些人强占民房又被房主赶出来，最后只好在街旁巷口自己搭小席棚，全家大小整天钻在棚里。吃喝太贵，一万块钱一斤小米也没人卖，好些人把带来的衣服首饰卖吃之后，还是没法过活，只好逼着自家女人卖身子，半夜三更这个官长来坐坐，那个官长来躺躺”，说到这里，桥万邦长吁一口气，很愤懑的说：“人有脸，树有皮呀，咱办不出这种丢脸的事情，我把两条黄牛杀吃以后，算看透蒋介石啦，过去都是上了他们的当。在解放区不管怎样总够吃够穿，不能卖自家女人的身子，我今后决心跟着八路军走。”至此桥万邦涕泪交流，悔悟万分。我政府人员当即将他送返原籍。
