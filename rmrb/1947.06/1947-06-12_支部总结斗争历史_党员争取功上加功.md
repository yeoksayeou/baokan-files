　　Branch Summarizes Struggle History
    Party Members Strive for More Achievements
    [Special Dispatch] To welcome "July 1st," a campaign to establish merits and promote famine preparedness is being widely carried out in She County. After discussion and research by responsible cadres of the Party, government, military, and mass organizations in the Eighth District, a merit-establishing plan for before "July 1st" was formulated. It calls on all organizations, cadres, masses, and Party members in the district to establish major merits before "July 1st" as a gift to the Party. The work goals in the merit-establishing plan are: 1. Solve the cadre-mass relationship and carry out a united and conscious movement. 2. Mobilize the masses, correct the paralyzed thinking of relying on heaven for food and eating warehouse grain for relief, and consciously formulate a production and saving plan to reduce the overall standard of living in the district by 30 percent. Each village branch should thoroughly summarize the history of development and struggle to inspire historical consciousness among Party members. Every Party member should formulate a merit-establishing plan for before "July 1st" and promote merit-establishing among the masses.
    On June 2nd, the Third District jointly convened a meeting of liberated peasants in Dongshu and Xishu, where the district government is located. Comrade Chen of the District Party Committee pointed out that the good times for liberated peasants were entirely given by the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army. He called on everyone to do a good job and strive to be a model in establishing merits for the people as a gift to the great benefactor—the Communist Party—to celebrate its birthday. He called on everyone to formulate specific plans for mutual competition and to summarize, inspect, and select models by "July 1st." In free speech, Wang Youlu, an old man nearly fifty years old from Xishu, stood up and spoke about how his family was exploited by the landlord, how he fell from a middle peasant, and how he had no choice but to become a soldier and became addicted to opium. The Eighth Route Army came and helped him quit his addiction, liberated him, and he became a middle peasant again. Then he said, "To cure the disease, thank the doctor; to enjoy the happiness, repay the benefactor. I want to improve my mutual aid team and lead the nine mutual aid teams in my lane well to help everyone get liberated and become prosperous." Chen Luozhi, a women's textile hero from the Third District, said, "In the past, I was a person in a sack. I was sold from Daming as a child bride at the age of eight or nine. I didn't have a bottom to cover myself when I slept; I was stuffed into a sack. Now the Communist Party has liberated us, but there are still places where I'm letting down my benefactors. I have a bad attitude as a women's rescue cadre, and I must correct it in the future, improve my textile mutual aid and lead the villages to improve their textiles." Many village cadres also successively put forward their merit-establishing plans and reviewed their shortcomings. Currently, the masses of Dongshu and Xishu have individually and collectively formulated merit-establishing plans, and the mutual aid teams are stepping up their efforts to carry water to irrigate cotton, melons, and harvest grain, preparing to be models in the future.

　　支部总结斗争历史
    党员争取功上加功
    【又讯】迎接“七一”开展立功推动备荒的运动在涉县普遍开展。八区经过党、政、武及群众团体负责干部讨论研究，订出“七一”前的立功计划。号召全区各团体、干部群众、党员，在“七一”前每人要立大功，作为对党的献礼。立功计划中的工作目标是：一、解决干群关系，进行团结自觉运动。二、动员群众，纠正靠天吃饭，吃仓谷等救济的麻痹思想，自觉订出生产节约计划，全区生活水平要降低百分之三十、各村支部，要深入的总结发展及斗争历史。启发党员的历史自觉，每个党员都订出“七一”前的立功计划，并推动群众立功。
    三区在六月二号于区公所驻地东戍、西戍联合召开翻身农民大会，区分委陈同志指出翻身农民的好时光完全是共产党八路军所给的，要大家以做好工作，争取模范为民立功来为大恩人——共产党——送礼祝寿。号召大家订出具体计划互相竞赛，到“七一”时总结检查选拔模范。在自由发言中，西戍将近五十岁的老汉王有禄站起来讲；他家怎样被地主剥削，由中农倒下来，自己没办法当了兵，又吸上料面瘾，八路军来了帮他戒了瘾，翻了身，又成了中农。然后说：“治好病要谢先生，享了福要报恩人，我要把我的互助组搞好，还要把我巷子里的九个互助组领导好，帮助大家翻身发家。”三区妇女纺织英雄陈罗枝说：“过去我是布袋里的人，八、九岁从大名卖出来当童养媳，睡觉没盖底，攒到布袋里，如今共产党来把咱解放了，可是还有对不住恩人的地方，当了妇救干部好动态度，今后一定要改正，把我的纺织互助搞好，并领导东西两村搞好纺织。”好多村干部也相继提了自己的立功计划，检讨了自己的缺点。现东、西戍群众已个别集体订出立功计划，各互助组正加紧担水浇棉浇瓜收拾谷地，准备将来当模范。（一林、喜顺、范直）
