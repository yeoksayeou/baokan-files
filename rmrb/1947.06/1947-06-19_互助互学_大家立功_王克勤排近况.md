　　Mutual Assistance and Learning, Everyone Achieves Merit
    Recent Situation of Wang Keqin's Platoon
    Mu Hua
    Since Comrade Wang Keqin returned from the Heroes' Congress in mid-March, he has further recognized his honor and responsibility, and has become more humble and prudent. He said: "I still have many shortcomings and areas where I can't compare to others. We must learn from any good experience and any strengths of others to improve ourselves. We must not slack off in our work and bury ourselves in hard work. We must study hard, read books and newspapers."
    Comrade Wang Keqin has been paying close attention to the matter of earning merit. He often explains to everyone: "It is glorious for an individual to earn merit, and it is even more glorious to help others earn merit." The platoon-level established a merit ledger, with the entire platoon evaluating and recording merits every five days, and the squad doing so every day. The method is to first gather the group leaders to talk, and then each squad deliberates and discusses, recording the approved list and facts in the merit ledger, without burying any one's contribution, no matter how small.
    The main contents of the merit plan formulated by Comrade Wang Keqin leading the entire platoon are: First, fight bravely and strategically, aiming to annihilate the enemy and preserve ourselves. Second, do not violate battlefield discipline or mass discipline. This plan has already been realized in the battle on the outskirts of Tangyin. During eight days of guard duty, he stayed awake day and night, monitoring the enemy from the sentry post. This further stimulated the comrades' enthusiasm. Group leader Wang Jingshu and soldier Lu Shan guarded a position a dozen meters from the enemy's chevaux-de-frise for three days without letting anyone relieve them, and they also repelled two enemy counterattacks on their own. The entire platoon engaged the enemy every night, but did not suffer any losses. Everyone discussed: "The platoon leader's methods are brilliant."
    On May 13th, the "Huaihe" unit's Third Brigade held a victory celebration and commendation meeting. Wang Keqin and sixty-eight People's Heroes entered the venue one after another. Amid the thunderous cheers and applause of the entire audience, he stood up to speak on behalf of all the heroes. He said: "We were elected as heroes because we have everyone; without everyone's efforts, we would not have achieved any results. Therefore, I hope everyone will help us more, assist and learn from each other, promote mutual progress, prepare for the great counter-offensive, and everyone will achieve merit." This was followed by a deafening chorus of "Learn from Wang Keqin" and "People's Heroes are the most glorious."
    In recent military training, Comrade Wang Keqin led the entire platoon in launching a mutual assistance and learning movement. He personally participated and took the lead in hard training. The method is to promote the strengths of liberated soldiers who have good skills to teach the new comrades, working together and studying how to aim accurately and why they can't aim accurately, always finding the reason, and then learning according to the good methods. Everyone teaches each other and learns from each other, learning very enthusiastically. His experience in uniting newly liberated soldiers is: old liberated comrades should offer more encouragement, more political education should be given, timely praise should be given, and care should not be given lightly in the form of money. Live together with everyone, and if problems arise, immediately educate and explain, and discuss and resolve them in a democratic manner.

　　互助互学·大家立功
    王克勤排近况
    牧华
    王克勤同志自三月中旬出席群英大会回来，进一步认识了自己的荣誉和责任，变得更加虚心持重。他表示：“我的缺点和比不上人家的地方还很多，人家任何一点好经验和一点长处咱都要学来，提高自己。在工作上不松一口气，埋头苦干。要努力学习，看书读报”。
    王克勤同志对立功问题抓得很紧，他常给大家解释：“个人立功光荣，帮助别人也立功更光荣。”班排部建立起立功账，全排五天来一次评功记功，班里一天一次。办法是先召集组长谈，再由各班酝酿讨论，把通过的名单和事实都记在立功账上，不埋没任何一个人的任何一件功劳。
    王克勤同志领导全排订的立功计划，主要内容是：一、作战有勇有谋，作到消灭敌人，保全自己。二、不违犯战场纪律和群众纪律。这个计划已在汤阴外围战斗中兑了现。八天的警戒任务，他昼夜不睡，一直在岗哨上监视敌人。因此更激发了同志们的积极性。组长王经书、战士卢山，在距敌鹿砦十几米处警戒三天，不让别人换，还单独打退敌两次反扑。全排每夜都和敌人接火，但没受一点损失。大家纷纷议论：“排长就是办法高。”
    五月十三日“淮河”部三大队召开祝捷贺功大会，王克勤和六十八名人民功臣相继进入会场，在全场雷动的欢呼与掌声中，他起立代表全体功臣讲话。他说：“我们当选英雄，是因为有大家；没有大家的努力，就什么也不会做出成绩。所以我希望大家更多帮助我们，互助互学，互相推动进步，准备大反攻，大家都立功。”接着就是一阵震天的“学习王克勤”“人民功臣最光荣”的呼声。
    在最近练兵中，王克勤同志领导全排开展互助互学运动，他亲自参加带头苦练，办法是发扬解放战士技术好的长处，来教新同志，一面作，一面研究如何才能瞄准，为什么他瞄不准，总要把原因找出来，然后按着好的办法学，大家你教我，我教你，学得很起劲。他团结新解放战士的经验是：要老解放同志多鼓励，要多从政治上教育，及时表扬，不要轻易以金钱照顾。要和大家生活在一起，有了问题马上教育解释，用民主方式讨论解决。
