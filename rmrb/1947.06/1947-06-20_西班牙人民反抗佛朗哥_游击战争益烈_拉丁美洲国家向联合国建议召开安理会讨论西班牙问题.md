Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: According to a TASS report from Moscow: Chaibolinski, in an article in Red Star newspaper, commented on the suggestion by five Latin American countries (Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Venezuela, and Uruguay) to the UN Secretariat to convene a Security Council meeting to discuss the Spanish question, stating: The economic and political crisis of the Franco regime is worsening. Hitler's puppet has plunged the Spanish economy into a disastrous situation, with unemployment exceeding 400,000. In addition, the financial crisis caused by the general decline in production and huge military expenditures is also increasingly serious. All this has caused the Spanish people to strongly hate the Franco dictatorship. Recently, strikes and guerrilla warfare have simultaneously greatly unfolded within Spain. In January and February alone, the guerrillas engaged in more than 100 battles of varying sizes. Foreign newspapers reported that underground organizations have branches in all departments of the country, and the people often actively assist the guerrillas. However, when the Franco fascist dictatorship cannot expect domestic support, it receives foreign aid. British and American monopolists, who control the most important sectors of the Spanish economy, are interested in maintaining the Franco regime because they hope to rely on Franco's help to completely control the Spanish economy and keep Spain as a base in the anti-democratic struggle. British and American companies are constantly expanding their trade with Spain. American companies are lending large amounts of credit to Spanish companies to purchase American electrical equipment, freight cars, and trucks. In addition, the Americans want them to invest their capital in Spain in the construction of airlines, airports, and telecommunications, the electrification of railways, and the rubber and petroleum industries. American newspapers are discussing the possibility of the United States granting Franco large loans. The anti-Franco movement inside and outside Spain directly endangers the existence of the Franco fascist dictatorship. It is clear that Franco's trick of restoring the monarchy with himself as the head of state is to make it easier for his patrons in London and Wall Street to provide economic assistance to fascist Spain under the guise of so-called "Franco regime turning to the left." It is no coincidence that Franco's trick of restoring the monarchy occurred at the same time that the US Congress was discussing Truman's "Aid" to Greece and Turkey bill. The author concludes that Franco's and his patrons' tricks will not deceive anyone. The democratic masses recognize that only when all foreign aid to Franco is stopped, and the Spanish people are given the opportunity to control the fate of their own country, can the fascist hotbed of the Iberian Peninsula be eliminated.

　　西班牙人民反抗佛朗哥
    游击战争益烈
    拉丁美洲国家向联合国建议召开安理会讨论西班牙问题
    【新华社陕北十三日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：柴勃林斯基在红星报上著文评论五个拉丁美洲国家（墨西哥、危地马拉、智利、委内瑞拉和乌拉圭）向联合国秘书处建议召开安理会会议讨论西班牙问题时称：佛朗哥政权的经济和政治危机日趋恶化，希特勒的傀儡使西班牙的经济陷于灾难情况，失业人数超过四十万。此外，生产普遍降低和军费浩繁所引起的财政危机也日益严重。这一切使西班牙人民对佛朗哥独裁强烈地憎恨。近来，罢工运动和游击战争同时已在西班牙国内大大展开。仅一、二两月，游击队就作过大小战斗一百余次。外国报纸报导，地下组织在国内各部都有支部，人民常常积极地援助游击队。但是当佛朗哥法西斯独裁不能期望国内的支持时，它却受到国外的援助。控制西班牙经济中最重要部门的英美垄断资本家，对保持佛朗哥政权是有兴趣的，因为他们希望靠佛朗哥的帮助全部控制西班牙经济，并且把西班牙留作反民主斗争中的基地。英美公司不断地扩展他们和西班牙的贸易，美国公司贷给西班牙公司以购买美国电气设备，货车和卡车的大量信用贷款。此外，美国人还要他们在西班牙的资本投资于航空线、机场和电讯交通的建设、铁路的电气化及橡胶和石油工业。美国报纸正在讨论美国予佛朗哥以大量贷款的可能性。西班牙国内外的反佛朗哥运动直接危及佛朗哥法西斯独裁的存在。很显然的，佛朗哥施用恢复以自己为元首的君主政体的诡计，是为了要他的伦敦商业区和华尔街的庇护者们在侈言所谓“佛朗哥政权向左转”的伪装下更容易给法西斯西班牙以经济援助。佛朗哥恢复君主政体的诡计和美国国会讨论杜鲁门“援助”希土法案同时发生，并不是偶然的。作者作结论说：佛朗哥及其庇护者的诡计将迷惑不了任何人。民主的人民大众认识，只有当一切对佛朗哥的国外援助停止了，而且西班牙人民得到把自己国家命运掌握在自己手中之机会的时候，伊伯利安半岛的法西斯主义温床才能消除。
