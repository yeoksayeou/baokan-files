Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th - Comprehensive Shanghai News: Chiang Kai-shek's terrifying suppression of the student movement has been met with strong resistance from all sides. After three Wuhan University students were brutally murdered by Chiang's military police on June 1st, representatives were sent to Beijing and Shanghai to report on the details of the massacre, and to demand that Hang Liwu, Deputy Minister of Chiang's Ministry of Education, and the school principal personally report to the students on the detailed situation of their negotiations with the Chiang government authorities. Nanjing students, in protest against this atrocity by Chiang's military police, decided to strike for a week starting from June 6th. The parents of the arrested students in Shanghai organized the "Shanghai Parents' Association of Arrested Students" to protest to Wu Guozhen, the Chiang-appointed Mayor of Shanghai, demanding the release of the students, and on the 7th, they hosted the press, appealing to the public. According to TASS, New York, 8th: Feng Yuxiang, who recently traveled to California, published a statement in the newspaper condemning the terrorist acts of Chiang Kai-shek's police, especially the recent arrests and killings of students. Feng stated: The students' demand to stop the civil war is justified. He warned Chiang government officials to be responsible for these atrocities and to learn from the fate of Hitler and Mussolini.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th - US News Service: The New York Herald Tribune commented on the 7th on the Chiang government's arrest of students, newspaper editors, and reporters last week, saying: "This kind of large-scale arrest is difficult to justify. The government's use of violence and secret police in an attempt to suppress outside criticism is also very disturbing. In view of the fact that the current cabinet (referring to the Chiang government) is unwilling to abide by all the pleasant words it has uttered in the past regarding civil liberties, and has completely disregarded the bill of rights in the new constitution (referring to the pseudo-constitution), it is truly heartbreaking. It is unreasonable to think that suppressing criticism of the government will contribute to China's peace and security. Student demonstrations and the essays written by journalists reflect the deep dissatisfaction of the Chinese people; this kind of dissatisfaction cannot be cured by violence. Unless the root causes of dissatisfaction are eliminated, no matter how many people are imprisoned, the expression of dissatisfaction cannot be suppressed."

　　抗议蒋家军警惨杀武大学生
    南京学生再罢课一周
    冯玉祥氏斥责蒋政府恐怖罪行
    【新华社陕北十一日电】综合沪息：蒋介石对学生运动之恐怖镇压，已遭各方强烈反抗。武汉大学学生六月一日被蒋家军警惨杀三人后，即派遣代表赴京沪报告该惨案经过，并要求蒋记教育部副部长杭立武与该校校长亲自向学生报告与蒋政府当局交涉之详细情形。南京学生为抗议蒋家军警此种暴行，决自六月六日起罢课一周。上海被捕学生各家长组织“上海市被捕学生家长联合会”，向蒋记上海市长吴国桢提出抗议，要求释放学生，并于七日招待新闻界，向社会人士伸诉。又据塔斯社纽约八日讯：最近游历加利福尼亚之冯玉祥氏，在报上发表声明，谴责蒋家警察的恐怖行为，特别是最近的逮捕和杀害学生事件。冯氏称：学生停止内战的要求是正当的。他警告蒋政府官员，要他们对这些暴行负责，和接受希特勒与墨索里尼命运之教训。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】美新闻处讯：纽约前锋论坛报于七日评论上周蒋政府逮捕学生、报馆编辑及记者一事称：“此种大举捕人之事，殊难使人认为合理。政府利用暴力与秘密警察，企图抑制外界之指摘，亦为令人极感不安之举。鉴于现内阁（指蒋政府）不愿过去所发表关于公民自由之一切动听言语，而将新宪法（指伪宪）中之权利议案完全置诸脑后，实堪使人痛心。若以为压抑对政府之指摘，足使对于中国之和平与安全有所贡献，实属毫无理由。学生之示威游行及报人所撰之论文，乃反映中国人民之深切不满；此种不满意决非暴力所能治疗。使人不满之根本原因一日不除，则无论将多少人系于狱中，终不能压制不满情绪之表达”。
