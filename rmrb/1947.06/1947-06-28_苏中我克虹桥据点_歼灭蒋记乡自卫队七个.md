　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 26th—A part of the local armed forces of the First Sub-district of Suzhong, on the 21st, captured the important Chiang-puppet stronghold of Hongqiao on the north side of the Hai'an-Taizhou line, and routed the enemy from the Huayuan stronghold who came to their aid. They completely annihilated seven Chiang Kai-shek village self-defense units, killing and capturing more than 70 enemies. The remaining enemies abandoned their guns and fled, allowing 100,000 people in the surrounding thirteen villages to see the light of day again, powerfully supporting the anti-"mopping-up" struggle south of the Hai'an-Taizhou line.
