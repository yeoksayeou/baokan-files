　　Contact the Masses, Be Heroic, Tenacious, and Persevere in Struggle:
    Comrade Liu Wenke Has Rendered Great Service to the People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 3rd] Comrade Liu Wenke, Secretary of the Luanping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Rehe West, combined armed forces to persevere in the struggle in the county under the serious circumstances of enemy attacks, and has rendered great service to the people. The Hebei-Rehe-Chahar District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has specially commended him, recorded a major merit, and promoted Comrade Liu to be a member of the Rehe West District Committee. Last autumn, when Chiang's troops attacked Rehe West and occupied the county, landlords and despots colluded with reactionary armed forces, taking the opportunity to launch a large-scale counter-attack against the masses, and the basic masses and some cadres showed panic. When the county committee discussed the action plan, a group of cadres led by Comrade Liu Wenke strongly advocated persisting in the work in Luanping. After a long debate, some comrades even suggested: "Such persistence is typical subjectivism." Comrade Wenke argued with reason, and it was finally decided that Comrade Wenke would leave a part of the cadres and armed forces to persist, and the rest would be transferred. For the past six months, Comrade Wenke has led a small number of cadres and troops to share life and death with the people of the county, repelling the counter-attacks of the stubborn troops and reactionary landlord armed forces, recovering the vast areas of Rehe West, laying the foundation for the restoration of work in Rehe West, and making a significant contribution to persisting in and developing the entire Hebei-Rehe-Chahar Liberated Area. The Hebei-Rehe-Chahar District Committee called on all cadres in the district to learn from Comrade Liu Wenke's spirit of heroism, tenacity, perseverance in struggle, and connection with the masses.
