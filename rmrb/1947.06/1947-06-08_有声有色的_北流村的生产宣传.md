　　Lively Production Propaganda in Beiliu Village
　　Shang Feng Jiang He Dong Kui
　　If you stay in Beiliu Village, Licheng County, for a day or two, you might be surprised: a Chinese mountain village can be so vibrant. Take a walk around the village and you'll immediately see three newly written blackboard newspapers; the next day at a certain time, music and reports from loudspeakers come from the rooftops; in the evening, if you walk to the wheat field, you might just catch a lively Xiaohua opera performance with gongs and drums. As for the slogans on the walls and the catchphrases circulating in people's mouths, they are timely, appropriate, and easy to remember, and can be seen and heard at any time. All these activities are focused on one point: promoting great production. According to incomplete statistics, from April 20th to May 20th, a total of three ballad lyrics, twelve poems and ditties, twenty-five clappers, and four Xiaohua operas were created in one month. These poems and ditties were not only created by the masses, but also widely recited by the public, boosting the morale of the masses and enabling them to engage in production persistently and enthusiastically, powerfully promoting the current production movement. How was all this achieved?
　　1. Getting Published is the Greatest Honor
　　The mass blackboard newspaper in Beiliu truly achieved mass participation in running the newspaper. All three blackboard newspapers in the village are changed every two days, and there are still not enough spaces for all the submissions. Many tasks have become active through the praise and reporting of the mass blackboard newspaper. For example, in April, the news that Shen Xiao'e used an accelerated spinning wheel to spin half a catty of yarn a day was reported, which encouraged women to spin yarn, so that the village's small weaving factory did not lack yarn. Liu Sanchong reported that Zhao Jiliang's team seized the season to sow seeds, setting off a wave of drought prevention and early planting in the village. Liu Gui'e submitted an article to the blackboard newspaper praising Shen Aizhu's planting flowers on the slopes, and other women were not convinced: "If others can plant on the slopes, so can we," and everyone threw themselves into field labor. Currently, the spring drought is severe, and the blackboard newspaper has timely praised the conservation model Liu Shouhe, and the masses responded: "Saving things can also get on the small newspaper, we must also save." Now, the masses in Beiliu Village universally nurture the idea that "getting published is the greatest honor." Last spring, the blackboard newspaper was not very effective. Teacher Wang Dongkui was determined to make the blackboard newspaper free from teacher monopoly and take root among the masses. He started by training correspondents. Young Zhang Yuxing and woman Liu Sanchong are the "Li Youcai" of Beiliu Village, and the masses call him the "Blackboard Talk King." With them as the backbone, two basic groups were organized, and then twelve active writers emerged (ten women and two men). In order to write a clapper about "Model Women Want Three Goods," Zhang Shuangying and Zhang Sanchong stayed up all night to write. When Shen Xianxiang saw that the women were writing enthusiastically, he also started writing. In half a month in May, seventeen submissions were received and two were forwarded to the county's small newspaper.
　　In training correspondents and mobilizing the masses to write and read newspapers, they gained several experiences: (1) Promote collective mass creation, write if you can, and ask others to write on your behalf if you can't. (2) Write about your own affairs and the affairs of your group, write whatever you can. (3) Writing is meritorious, publicly summarize writing achievements, and commend models. (4) Not only must you regularly guide the masses in reporting policies, but you must also actually help with writing, with dedicated personnel responsible for receiving and revising manuscripts. (5) When publishing, try to mobilize the correspondents to transcribe themselves on the blackboard. Even if it is not written well, the masses love to read it, and the writer themselves is happy. (6) Leave a name after the report. In addition, pay attention to clarity and liveliness in the layout, do not write strange or cursive characters, and use more clapper forms.
　　In this way, the number of people reading the newspaper gradually increased; the submitters, "hitchhiking," asked others to come and see, and the praised people and their families also wanted to see. Below is a piece that was first published on the blackboard newspaper and then circulated among the masses:
　　"Mountain eggs bloom red all over the slope,
　　Liu Zhongjing leads a good work style,
　　The team members support him very much,
　　He respects the team members very much,
　　Red flowers set off green leaves,
　　He really does not separate himself from the masses."
　　2. Everyone Wants to "Roll the Loudspeaker"
　　Another propaganda weapon in Beiliu Village is the loudspeaker. It broadcasts reports on the lives of the masses, saving many unnecessary meetings. Every three, six, and nine days of the month, the masses can hear the broadcast at home. The village has four broadcasting stations: one main station and three sub-stations, broadcasting and rebroadcasting in sequence, so that the entire village can hear. The content mainly focuses on the village's production work, simple current affairs news, and especially emphasizes the commendation of models. The broadcast strives to be simple, with one focus at a time. For example, at the end of April, when it rained two or three fingers overnight, the masses still had the idea of waiting for the "thorough rain" to continue. At this time, the Production Committee seized the living fact that Wang Wenji seized the season to rush to plant, and the broadcasting station called on the masses to seize the season to plant cotton. Everyone listened to the broadcast and planted cotton, and completed the sowing of more than 500 mu of cotton. The effect of broadcasting achievements and commending models at any time is also particularly great. After the broadcast, Zhao Jiliang's team felt honored, their production enthusiasm increased, and they automatically convened a joint meeting of team leaders to study how to further promote production. Now, the masses in Beiliu Village are often proud of being "people in the loudspeaker," and everyone says, "Rolling the loudspeaker" is not simple!
　　3. Everyone Wants to "Take the Stage"
　　The comprehensive cultural and entertainment broadcast in Beiliu Village can be regarded as a new creation. Generally, it appears once every ten days, combined with the village's short-term production movement plan and summary, in the form of square dances, short dramas, and clappers. The content is mostly collected from various aspects of the village's production movement, typical model figures, and model deeds are compiled into short dramas, clappers, Xiaohua operas, etc., which are performed simply by elementary school students and some young men and women on stage. Elementary school students prepare during extracurricular game time, and young men and women also compose and sing on their own in their spare time. The recently compiled and performed "Early Planting Xiaohua Opera" and "Dialogue Song and Dance of Assault Sowing", because of the clear center and short and lively nature, have all won praise from the masses.
　　First, "performing in public is infinitely glorious," and second, production is busy and people need to watch small operas to relax. Therefore, after the emergence of comprehensive cultural and entertainment broadcasts, the masses generally demanded to "take the stage." When the performance of Zhang Hongxi and Zhao Jiliang's teams completed the first phase of the production plan, the masses whispered and pondered, saying: "We must work hard!" Textile hero Liu Zhongjing demanded that the model deeds of their small factory also be brought to perform. Using this method to arrange and summarize work is more acceptable to the masses than attending meetings and listening to speeches. This "self-made, self-composed, self-entertaining" cultural and entertainment policy is worth continuing to implement and develop into a rural square club, which is beneficial to the promotion of various tasks.
　　4. Popular and Timely Slogans
　　The propaganda slogans in Beiliu Village generally pay attention to being popular, clear, and changing in a timely manner. In order to implement drought prevention and early planting, it was proposed: "Seize the season to sow early, it is more laborious to plant when the soil is dry," and later, as the drought continued to develop, it was proposed: "Seize the season to carry water for planting, planting one more point counts as one point" and "Seeing seedlings harvest three points, catching seedlings is the most important thing," so that the village successfully completed the ten-day production plan.
　　For example, in order to implement self-criticism and mutual unity education, it was proposed among women: "Model women want three goods: say good at home to the in-laws, say good to team members in production mutual aid, and say good in the village to the masses." Carrying out the model women to have three goods movement, gradually overcame the unhealthy trends of some young women, strengthened the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and more powerfully united production.
　　5. Unified Organization and Leadership
　　How are these various propaganda tasks carried out? This mainly relies on a unified organization and leadership. A "Propaganda Federation" was established in the village, and its负责人 directly participated in the leading group of the Production Committee. He also added the propaganda committee members of various mass organizations as the backbone to organize a separate organization for production propaganda work - the Propaganda and Commendation Department. This department has two directors and deputy directors (that is, members of the Production Committee), and is divided into editing, cultural and entertainment broadcasting, and mass ideological education groups. The editing group takes elementary school teachers and Beiliu Village's "Li Youcai" Zhang Yuxing as the core, responsible for writing clappers, Xiaohua operas, etc., training and contacting correspondents, revising manuscripts, and arranging mass blackboard newspapers. The cultural and entertainment broadcasting group is responsible for the broadcasting station and comprehensive cultural and entertainment broadcasting work. The mass ideological education group is responsible for the people's school and mass ideological education.
　　This institution is very capable. At the same time, it does not rely solely on this institution, because things are needed by everyone, and everyone comes out to do it when mentioned, so the various tasks mentioned above can be done.

　　有声有色的
    北流村的生产宣传
    尚枫　江河　东魁
    如果你到黎城北流村住上一两天，你也许会惊奇：一个中国山地的农村，竟能有如此的活跃。绕村走一趟，马上看到三块新写的黑板报；隔天到一定时候，房顶上传来音乐声和喇叭筒里放出的报告；晚上走到麦场里，碰巧锣鼓喧天的小花戏正演得热闹。至于墙头的标语，口中流传的口号，适时恰当而且顺嘴，那更是随时可以看到、听到。这一切活动都集中到一点：推动大生产。据不完的统计：从四月二十日到五月廿日一月中共编出鼓词三篇、诗歌小调十二篇、快板廿五篇、小花戏四个。这些诗歌小调。不但出之于群众创作，而且更为大众所传诵，鼓舞了群众情绪，使得持久而且饱满地进行生产，有力的推动起当前的生产运动来，这一切是怎样办到的呢？
    一、上报最光荣
    大众黑板报在北流真正做到了群众办报。全村三块黑板报，两天换一次，稿子还登不完。许多工作是通过大众黑板的表扬和报导而活跃起来的。比如：四月份报导了申小娥使用加速轮纺花车，一天纺线半斤的消息；鼓舞了妇女纺线，使村中的小型织布厂，不缺线用了。刘三虫报导了赵记良大队趁垧下种的消息，全村掀起防旱早种的浪潮。刘贵娥给黑板报投稿表扬了申爱珠的上地栽花，别的妇女不服气：“别人上地，咱也能上”，大家都投入田地劳动中。目前春旱严重，黑板报上及时表扬了节约模范刘守河，群众反映：“节省东西还能上小报，咱也要节约哩。”现在北流村群众普遍滋长着“上报最光荣”的思想。在去年春天黑板报还是不大起作用的。教员王东魁决心使黑板报脱离教员包办，在群众中生根。他从培养通讯员作起。青年张玉兴、妇女刘三虫是北流村的“李有才”，群众叫他为“板话大王”，以他们为骨干，组织了两个基本小组，随后就涌现出十二个写稿的积极分子，（女十男二）。为了写一个“模范妇女要三好”的快板，张双英、张三虫，竟彻夜不眠的赶写。男人申贤相看见妇女写稿很热烈，也写起来了。五月份半个月，就收到稿子十七件，并转给县小报二件。
    在培养通讯员，发动群众写稿看报上，他们得到几点经验：（一）发扬群众集体创作，能写则写，不能写给别人说代写。（二）写自己的事本组的事，能写甚就写甚。（三）写稿立功，当众总结写稿成绩，表扬模范。（四）不但经常指导群众报导方针，还得实际帮助写稿，专人负责收稿、改稿等。（五）刊登时尽量发动通讯员自己在黑板上誊写。纵然写得不好，群众却爱看，即他自己也高兴。（六）报后留名。此外，在编排上注意清醒活泼，不写怪字草字，多用快板形式。
    这样，看报的群众逐渐增加；投稿人，“搭各”上别人来看，被表扬的人及其家庭也要看看。下面，是先登在黑板报上，然后在群众中流传起来的一篇：
    “山蛋蛋开花满坡红，
    刘仲景领导的好作风，
    组员对他很拥护，
    他对组员很尊重，
    红花衬绿叶，
    人家真是不脱离群众。”
    二、人人都愿“滚圪筒”
    北流村另一件宣传武器，就是广播筒。它广播报导了群众生活，省去了很多不必要的会议。每到三、六、九日，群众在家里便可听见广播。全村四个广播台：一个总台，三个分台，连发连播，次第转播，全村可闻。内容主要是本村的生产工作，简单的时事消息，特别是着重表扬模范。广播力求简单，一次一个中心。为了吸引群众注意，又组织村中会乐器的人，在广播开始先奏音乐，而后广播，群众感到很有兴趣。
    广播台的好处，是迅速指导了群众生产。就象在四月底一夜落雨二、三指，第二天群众还有等待继续落“透雨”的思想，这时生产委员会，便抓住王文记趁垧赶种的活事实，广播台号召群众趁垧种棉。大家一听广播种棉，纷纷扛犁拿籽，完成了五百余亩的棉花下种。随时广播成绩，表扬模范，效力也特别大。赵记良大队经过广播，全队感到光荣，生产劲头提高，自动召开小组长联席会，研究如何更进一步推动生产。现在北流群众都常以“广播筒里的人”自豪，大家都说：“滚圪筒”，可不简单！
    三、个个都想“登登场”
    北流村的综合文娱广播，可算是一种新创造。一般的十天一次，结合着村里生产运动的短期计划和总结，用广场的歌舞短剧快板等形式出现。内容大都是从本村生产运动中的各个侧面，收集典型的模范人物，模范事迹编成短剧，快板、花戏等，由小学生和一部分青年男女，登台作简单表演。小学生在课外游戏时间准备，青年男女也是闲时自编自唱，象最近编演的“早种小花戏”和“突击下种的对话歌舞”，因为中心明确，短小活泼，都博得群众好评。
    一来“当众表演、光荣无比”，再者生产忙碌，需要看看小戏调剂，因此，综合的文娱广播出现之后，群众普遍要求“登登场”。当表演张鸿喜、赵记良两大队完成第一期生产计划时，群众交头接耳酝酿说：“咱可得好好干哩！”纺织英雄刘仲景要求把他们小型工厂的模范事迹，也拿来表演表演。用这种方式布置和总结工作，群众爱看，比开会听讲话更易领受。这种“自事自编，自唱自乐”的文娱方针，值得继续贯彻，使发展成为农村广场俱乐部，这对各种工作的推动都有好处。
    四、通俗适时的口号
    北流村的宣传口号，一般注意到通俗明确及时转变。为了贯彻防旱早种，提出：“趁垧早下种，垧干栽种更费工”，后来旱象继续发展，又提出：“趁垧担水栽种，多种一分算一分”及“见苗三分收，捉苗最要紧”的口号，使全村十天生产计划胜利完成。
    又如为了贯彻了自我批评互相团结的教育，在妇女中提出：“模范妇女要三好：在家翁婆说好，生产互助中组员说好，在村里群众说好”。开展模范妇女要三好运动，逐渐克服部分青年妇女的歪风，密切了婆媳关系，更有力的团结生产。
    五、一元化的组织领导
    这各种各样的宣传工作，怎样作起来呢？这主要是靠一元化的组织领导。村中成立了“宣联会”，它的负责人直接参加了生产委员会的领导集团。又由他加上各群众团体的宣传常委作为骨干，组织了搞生产宣传工作的单独组织——宣传表扬部。这个部设正副部长二人（即生产委员会的委员），下分编辑，文娱广播，群众思想教育三组。编辑组以小学教员及北流村“李有才”张玉兴等为核心，负责编写快板花戏等，培养联络通讯员、修改稿件，编排大众黑板报。文娱广播组负责广播台，综合性的文娱广播工作。群众思想教育组，负责民校及群众思想教育。
    这个机构，很能办事。同时，也不单靠这个机构，因为事情是大家需要的，一提头大家都出来办，因此上面所说种种工作，才能做得起来。
