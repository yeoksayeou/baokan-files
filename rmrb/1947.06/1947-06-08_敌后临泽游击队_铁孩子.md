　　Guerrilla Unit "Iron Children" Behind Enemy Lines in Linze

　　Chiang Kai-shek's 85th Division calls our Linze Third District Guerrilla Unit "Iron Children." The Linze Third District Guerrilla Unit also uses this victorious name to harass the enemy on the Juhe Highway. This spring, three American-made ten-wheel trucks of the Chiang Kai-shek's 85th Division Transportation Brigade returned to Heze from Yuncheng and encountered this group of "Iron Children" near Dushiji. They ambushed, half on the side of the road and half in the surrounding villages, waiting for the cars to enter the ambush circle. Twelve "Iron Children" stripped to the waist and rushed towards the cars. The cars heard gunshots in front, panicked and ran into the wheat field, trying to break through. The twelve Iron Children chased them like hungry tigers pouncing on sheep. The guerrilla fighters and the people from the surrounding villages also started shooting. Wherever the cars drove, guns were fired, and the villagers stood at the heads of their villages shouting. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers heard gunshots from every village and didn't know how many troops were around. The drivers immediately jumped out of the cars and fled. Three large trucks were left abandoned in the wheat field. Three Chiang Kai-shek officers were killed, two were wounded, and five were captured. They seized one American-made rifle Type 77, one Japanese-made rifle Type 99, one Type 38, and many other spoils of war.
    The "Iron Children" victoriously climbed onto the trucks, and the people from the surrounding villages swarmed to celebrate their victory, sharing American biscuits, and carrying away rice and items abandoned by the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers. The "Iron Children" returned to their resting place and put on American-style clothes while talking and laughing. In particular, Comrade Dou Xingbao was completely Americanized, wearing an American two-foot-long colorful towel, an American flannel striped shirt, and even his ammunition bag was American-made. After receiving their victory report, the Jilu Yu General Military Committee issued a commendation order to reward them.
    From its establishment to today, not a single member of this team of "Iron Children" has been injured or killed. They have protected the interests of the masses and harassed the Chiang Kai-shek troops countless times, killing thirty-eight bad guys, controlling rural positions, and maintaining democratic order. The Chiang Kai-shek troops threatened to set up strongholds in Dushiji. The "Iron Children" combat hero and veteran sharpshooter, Tian Side, said: "Let the Chiang Kai-shek troops set it up. Unless they never leave their doors, my bullets will chase after their heads as soon as they step out." He is an older man, but he still marches at night, scouts, and fights with this team of "Iron Children." He can often be heard saying: "Comrades, hard work is for your own safety, for the safety of your whole family. If you don't kill old Chiang, old Chiang will kill you."

### 敌后临泽游击队  铁孩子

　　敌后临泽游击队
    铁孩子
    蒋军八十五师叫我临泽三区游击队为“铁孩子”。临泽三区游击队也就以这常胜的名字在巨荷公路上和敌人周旋。今年春天蒋军八十五师运输大队美造十轮卡车三辆由郓城回荷泽，进到都市集附近遇上了这队“铁孩子”。他们埋伏着，一半在路旁，一半在周围村里，等汽车开至埋伏圈内。十二个“铁孩子”脱了光脊梁迎车冲上去。汽车听到前面枪响，慌张地窜到麦地里去，企图突围，十二个铁孩子象饿虎扑羊一样追上去。埋伏在周围各村的游击队员，和老百姓也都打起枪来，汽车向那里开那里就打过枪来，村村的老百姓都站在村头上呼喊。蒋军听见村村枪声不知道周围有多少人马。司机员立即跳车潜逃，三辆大汽车停在麦田里。蒋军校级军官三人被击毙，打伤了两人，捉了五个，缴获美造步枪七七式一支，日造步枪九九式、三八式各一支，还有许多战利品。
    “铁孩子”们胜利的登上车，周围村庄的老百姓也蜂拥跑来，庆祝他们的胜利，分吃美国饼干，背走了大米和蒋军丢下的东西。“铁孩子”们回到他们休息的地方，连说带笑的穿起美式衣裳。特别是窦兴宝同志混身上下都美械化了，扎上美国二尺多长的五彩毛巾，穿上美国绒花条衬衣，子弹袋也是美国造的。冀鲁豫总武委会接到他们捷报后，下了一道嘉奖令奖励了他们。
    从成立到今天，这一队“铁孩子”没有一个伤亡。他们保卫群众利益，袭扰蒋军不知有多少次，打死坏蛋三十八人，控制了农村阵地，保持了民主秩序。蒋军扬言要在都市集按据点，“铁孩子”战斗英雄老神枪手田四德说：“叫蒋军按吧，除非他永远不出门，一出门我的子弹就会追上他的脑壳”。他已是上了岁数的人，现在他仍和这队“铁孩子”一样夜行军，侦察战斗。经常可听到他这样说：“伙计们，辛苦正是为了自己的安全，为了全家的安全，你不打死老蒋，老蒋就会打死你。”
