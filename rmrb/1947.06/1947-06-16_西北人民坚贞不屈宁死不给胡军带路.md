Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 13th: Under the bayonets of Chiang Hu's army, the heroic and moving deeds of the unyielding Northwest people are spreading everywhere. At the end of March, when Hu Jun occupied Anse, they captured Wang Si, an old man from Huang Bolang Village, to guide them, intending to raid a local factory. Old Man Wang remained silent and led Hu Jun to climb mountains and cross gullies, turning left and right, until it was dark, and then led Hu Jun back to the original place. At this time, Hu Jun realized he had been tricked. Old Man Wang said, "You are too ferocious, you scared me into confusion. The Eighth Route Army doesn't have your kind of behavior." The enemy was furious and cruelly murdered Old Man Wang. When Hu Jun retreated from Anse back to Yan'an, they also grabbed Yang Buju, a young farmer from Shijia Gou, to guide them. Yang resolutely refused and retorted to Hu Jun, "Where did you come from? Why can you come from Yan'an but not retreat to Yan'an?" Hu Jun smashed his face, and Yang ran away. Hu Jun concentrated fire with five rifles. When Yang crossed the Yan River and went up the mountain, he was unfortunately hit in the lower abdomen by a bullet and died heroically. Another time, a Hu Jun soldier met Yang, a blind old man in his seventies, on the street in Yanhewan Village. The Hu Jun soldier held a gun to Yang's chest and asked, "Is the Central Army good or the Eighth Route Army good?" Yang answered without hesitation, "The Eighth Route Army is good." The Hu Jun soldier exclaimed in surprise and anger, "What did you say?" Yang repeated, "I said the Eighth Route Army is good." The Hu Jun soldier succumbed at this time. They put down their guns and whispered to Old Man Yang, "If you say that again and the officials hear it, be careful you'll lose your head." After saying that, the soldier hurried away.

　　西北人民坚贞不屈宁死不给胡军带路
    【新华社西北十三日电】在蒋胡军刺刀尖下，西北人民坚贞不屈的可歌可泣事件到处传闻。三月底胡军侵占安塞时，曾捕捉黄伯梁村王四老汉带路，图抄袭某地工厂。王老汉默默不发一言，带领胡军翻山爬沟，左转右转，直到天黑又把胡军带回原地。此时胡军始知上当。王老汉却说：“你们太凶狠，把我吓糊涂了。八路军就没有你们这号作风。”敌大怒惨将王老汉杀害。安塞胡军回窜延安时，也抓了史家沟的青年农民杨步均带路。杨坚决拒绝，并反问胡军：“你们从那里来的？为什么能从延安来不能往延安退？”胡军打破了他的脸，杨拔腿便跑。胡军以五支步枪集中射击，当杨涉过延河上山时，终于不幸被子弹击中小腹，壮烈牺牲。又一次，胡军一个士兵在延河湾村街上遇见一七十多岁老头杨瞎子，胡军士兵拿枪逼在杨瞎子胸口问：“中央军好八路军好？”杨毫不犹豫断然回答：“八路军好。”胡军士兵惊异地怒叫起来：“你说什么？”杨重复又说：“我说八路军好。”胡军士兵此时屈服了，他们放下了枪，低声告诉杨老汉：“你再这样说，叫当官的听见了，当心脑袋搬家。”说完，这个士兵便急忙走开了。
