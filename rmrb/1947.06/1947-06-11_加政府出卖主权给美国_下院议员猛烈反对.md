　　TASS, Ottawa: The most intense debate of the current session of the Canadian Parliament occurred on June 4th in the House of Commons. Many members of the opposition parties sharply criticized the government's bill which stipulated the power of U.S. Army military tribunals stationed in Canada. They pointed out that the presence of U.S. troops on Canadian territory would be regarded as an infringement on Canadian sovereignty. In fact, all the speakers vehemently opposed the stationing of U.S. troops on Canadian territory. Member of Parliament Green demanded a full report on the agreement under which U.S. troops were stationed in Canada. Green stated: Any measures in this regard must be approved by the United Nations. Conservative member Merritt stated that the actions of the Canadian government "have far-reaching consequences." Independent Liberal Party member Pouliot declared that Canada should not become a playground for Americans. He said he did not believe that training U.S. troops on other people's territory was the kind of thing that leads to peace.

　　加政府出卖主权给美国
    下院议员猛烈反对
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社渥太华讯：加拿大国会本届会议时，六月四日在下院的辩论是最剧烈的。各反对党的许多议员尖锐抨击政府法案中规定美国驻加陆军军事法庭之权力。并指出，美国军队在加拿大领土上的出现，将被视为对加拿大主权之侵害。实际上，所有的发言者都猛烈的反对美国军队驻在加拿大领土上。议员格林要求充分报告美军驻加拿大所根据的协议。格林称：在这方面的任何措施，必须经联合国通过。保守党员麦锐特称：加拿大政府的行动，“其后果所及是很深远的”。独立自由党人波力奥特宣称：加拿大不应该变为美国人活动的场所。他说，他不相信在别人领土上训练美国军队是引致和平的那种说法。
