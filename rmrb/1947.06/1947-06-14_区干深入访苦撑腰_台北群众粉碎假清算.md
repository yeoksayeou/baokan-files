District Cadres Deeply Visit, Support, and Strengthen
Taipei Masses Smash Sham Purge
[Our newspaper's report from Jilu Yu on the 11th] The masses of Beitaicun Village, Shouchang, exposed the landlords' conspiracy of a sham struggle and earnestly re-investigated. The village has a total of fifty-eight households, all named Yue. Two wineries are opened in the village, operated by landlords and a few rich peasants. Poor people mostly sell their labor to the wineries, suffering from the exploitation of the landlords. The old rulers, through the village chief Yue Xiuzhi and the peasant association chairman Yue Xiusui, have been suppressing the masses. At the beginning of the year, after the news of land reform spread to the village, landlords Yue Chongqun and Chongmei approached the village cadres and said: "We can't stop the trend of struggle in other villages. We are all family members in the village, so let's struggle through it lightly, so as not to make everyone look bad." When district cadres came to the village, the landlords told Yue Xiuzhi and Xiusui: "District cadres can't just stay in our village anyway. The Eighth Route Army and democracy are in our hands. When the cadres ask who is good and who is bad, you can say that Yue Chongxing (a well-to-do middle peasant, an honest 'blind' household) is a big tyrant who should be struggled against." After the district cadres talked about the situation, they went to other villages. So, the village struggled against Yue Chongxing, blocking the "official business." This time, each village launched a re-investigation. Landlords Yue Chongqun and others saw that the situation was not right, and they discussed it with the village cadres. They took the initiative to strengthen it, arranging a fake struggle. Each household prepared two people to raise opinions. After the discussion, they invited the district cadres to participate in the meeting. The village cadres pretended to tie up Yue Chongqun, Chongmei, and several others. More than a dozen people raised opinions. At that time, food, tables, and chairs were seized from the landlords' homes and filled the field. In the evening, landlords Yue Chongmei and others invited the village cadres to drink and discuss the method of distributing things. One stone of wheat was divided into two pecks for the poor, and one stone of corn was divided into six pecks. The packages were distributed to the group for preservation, which was easy to assemble when Chiang [Kai-shek] came. And two sets of accounts were established, one was the real detailed accounts, and the other was for the federation cadres to see. Finally, the bad eggs Yue Xiujia and Chongfu proposed, "Other villages are fighting landlords and pursuing floating wealth. Our village cannot lag behind." The next day, they publicly tortured the landlords Yue Chongqun, Chongmei, and others, and each person pursued 15 jin of cotton. The landlords were still uneasy, and Yue Xiusui convened an emergency meeting. All peasant members attended. Yue Xiujia asked everyone to swear: "We are all from the same old grandfather in the village. There is no need to make enemies. The poor people will not starve if there is a winery. Anyway, the Eighth Route Army will not last long. Anyone who leaks the news will be treated as a special agent and their whole family will be wiped out and expelled from the village." No one dared to say anything. When Comrade Wang from the Federation came to the village and saw that the masses were depressed, he visited seven or eight poverty-stricken families, and then asked several group leaders in detail to inquire and enlighten them. At first, they did not dare to speak. After mobilization and education, they began to understand the landlords' conspiracy. They immediately arrested nine bad eggs including Yue Chongqun, Yue Chongfu, and Yue Xiujia, and expressed their attitude to the masses. The masses began to mobilize. Jia Yucai excitedly said: "I used to bow my head and endure my anger and didn't dare to hum. The wall will leak even if it is a hundred layers thick." The masses said in unison: "Our village will re-investigate the landlords and elect a new leader." On the spot, Jia Yucai and Wang Yuechen were elected as the president and vice president. The next day, the re-investigation movement was launched, and more than 50 stones of grain, more than 300 pieces of clothing, silver dollars, and farm tools were found.

　　区干深入访苦撑腰
    台北群众粉碎假清算
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】寿张北台村群众揭破地主假斗争阴谋，认真复查。该村共有五十八户，全村都是岳姓，村内开设两个酒池，由地主和几家富农经营，穷人多卖劳力给酒池，受着地主们的剥削，旧日统治者通过村长岳修之、农民会长岳修遂，一直镇压着群众。年初土地改革的风声传到该村后，地主岳崇群、崇梅便找村干说：“外村斗争的风头咱也挡不住了，咱全村都是自家人轻轻的斗过去，省得大家难看。”区干到村，地主即和岳修之、修遂说：“区干部反正不能光在咱村里，八路军与民主，咱当家，干部问谁好谁坏，您就说岳崇兴（富裕中农，老实‘眼子’户）是个大恶霸该斗”。区干部谈了下情况到外村去了，于是村里就斗争了岳崇兴，挡了“公事”。这次各村掀起了复查，地主岳崇群等看着风头不对，和村干商量了，先下手为强，布置了假斗争，每个户家又预备两个提意见的。商量妥当，请区干部参加大会。村干把岳崇群、崇梅等几个人假绑起来，又有十几个人提了意见，当时到地主家中清查出粮食、桌子、椅子摆了满场，晚上地主岳崇梅等即请村干喝酒，商量分东西的办法，麦子一石分给穷人二斗，棒子一石分给六斗，包袱分到小组保存，蒋来容易集合。并建立两个账本，一本是真正流水账，一本是给联合会干部看的。最后坏蛋岳修甲、崇符又提出“别的庄上都是打地主追浮财，咱庄上也不能显出落后”。第二天又当众拷打了地主岳崇群，崇梅等几人，每人追出棉花十五斤。这样地主们心里还放不下，又叫岳修遂开了紧急会，全体农会员都到场，岳修甲让大家发誓：“咱全村都是一个老爷爷，也犯不着结冤仇，有酒池穷爷们也饿不着，反正八路军撑不长，谁要走露风声就按特务办他，清剿全家，提出村去。”群众谁也不敢啃气。联合会王同志到村看到群众沉闷，即访问了七、八家赤贫，又找了几个小组长详细盘问启发，开始他们不敢说，经过动员教育，始了解；地主的阴谋，即逮捕了岳崇群、岳崇符、岳修甲等九个坏蛋，并向群众表明态度，群众开始发动，贾育才兴奋的说：“我过去低头受气不敢哼，墙打百层也有透风的时候”。群众齐声说：“咱村重新清查地主，选个新领导人”，当场贾育才、王月臣被选为正副会长，第二天便展开了清查运动，前后共查出粮食五十余石，衣服三百余件及银元农具等。
