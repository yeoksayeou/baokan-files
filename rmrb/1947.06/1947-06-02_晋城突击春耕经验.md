Jincheng's Experience in a Spring Ploughing Blitz
    Bo Ming
            (1) The Early Bird Catches the Worm: Starting Early
    On New Year's Day this year, the county government's New Year's greetings to the villages proposed overcoming the fear of wealth, "What's there to fear about not being corrupt, not being a bully, and showing off wealth?" After the Awakening of Insects, it called on village cadres at the village cadre meeting to actively engage in spring ploughing. At that time, all village cadres guaranteed to complete plowing, sending manure, and preparing to participate in the war within ten days. As a result, the entire county completed spring ploughing and sowing half a month ahead of schedule and quickly shifted to sideline production such as spinning and transportation.
    At that time, what ideas hindered starting early? First, dragging ideas such as "This year's spring is deep and the days are long, there's no need to rush in the second lunar month," and "Loafing around in the first lunar month, strolling in the second lunar month, and dawdling in the third lunar month" were widespread. Second, waiting for rain, waiting for livestock, waiting for men to return from corvée duty to plant. "People can't finish it, but heaven can provide a meal. As long as the heavens send rain, you don't need to rush," "Spring has no life for women," "Women's work doesn't count, small feet tread the ground firmly." Third, cadres believe they are too busy to lead production. In short, without organization, there is no way to start. Therefore, the leadership first used the method of calculating labor, figuring out how many laborers and livestock there were in the whole village besides those participating in the war and distant corvée; second, calculating living expenses, figuring out how much land, manure, and supplies the participants had; and then calculating the time, figuring out how much time there was between the Qingming Festival and the Grain Rain Festival. This helped everyone open their minds and carefully consider how to proceed. Then, they praised the positive thoughts and actions between the masses and the cadres, such as "The early bird catches the worm," "Rather grab the soil in the third month than the wetness in the fourth month," "Rather have people wait for the rain than have the rain wait for people," and "Stop spinning and weaving, and spin and weave again after planting," using the masses' experience to educate the masses.
            (2) Temporary Blitz and Regular Mutual Aid
    In the process of the spring ploughing blitz, the county organized 6,312 temporary mutual aid teams. According to the statistics of seven districts (missing the first and fifth districts), 70,665 people were organized to participate in the spring ploughing blitz. In the sixth district, out of 6,860 households, 6,770 households participated in mutual aid teams. In the eighth district, only 138 households in the entire district did not participate in mutual aid. More than 6,000 mutual aid teams in the county were able to combine sideline production with spring ploughing and maintain regular mutual aid in 495 teams. The leadership promptly proposed to continue the temporary mutual aid, using good examples of regular mutual aid to demonstrate to the whole county and give others a chance to learn.
            (3) Combining Mutual Aid Teams
    Mutual aid teams of this type are represented by Liaohu Village in the third district, Beipo Village and Zhanglukou Village in the eighth district, and Xigao Village in the second district. The masses created methods of combining production and participation in the war, agriculture and sideline occupations. Their characteristics are (1) Participation in the war comes first; everything is for the victory of the front line. Rewards are given to participating laborers, increasing the work points by two fen per day. And they guarantee to plow and plant for the participants first.
    From labor exchange between agriculture and sideline occupations to cooperation between agriculture and sideline occupations, Xigao Village stipulates that spinning four taels of high-quality yarn earns one work point, sewing a cloth shirt earns two and a half work points, and sewing a pair of soles earns four work points. The Beipo and Zhanglukou village mutual aid teams draw one or two people and two or three animals to transport goods. The profits are distributed in an 80/20 split, with 20% going to the transporters and animals, and 80% going to the mutual aid team. Shareholders in the team receive 40%, and the remaining 40% is distributed according to the strength of the labor, with those who contribute ten work points receiving ten points and those who contribute seven points receiving seven points, making the mutual aid team more complete. Now, the entire village has combined ironworkers, weavers, farriers, and small furnace workers with agricultural mutual aid teams to form a large cooperative factory. All sideline income goes to the team and is distributed according to labor. Farmers receive one work point for a full day of labor, weavers receive one work point for fifteen feet of cloth, and kiln workers receive one work point for two shifts. Regardless of whether they are farmers or workers, the number of work points they earn is reduced by the number of work points required on their own land, and the remaining work points are used for dividends. Those with special achievements receive bonuses.
            (4) Mobilizing Women to Participate in Agricultural Labor
    The mobilization of women to participate in agricultural labor is best in the eighth district. Of the 6,345 working women in the district, 2,870 have been organized. The reasons for achieving organization are: 1. The leadership has universally carried out ideological mobilization, dispelling women's thoughts of relying on men and being afraid of being ugly. They called on men to make contributions on the front lines and women to produce in the rear. 2. Active elements took the lead. Zhang Jiangshui, a cadre in Qiaoxi Village, first mobilized his own woman to go to the fields and then mobilized others, influencing neighbors, and quickly organized them. 3. Constant encouragement. After the women of Hecun appeared in the "Laborer's Daily," the women of Zhijiao repeatedly asked the district cadres to inspect their work in the mutual aid team. 4. Equal pay for equal work is implemented.

　　晋城突击春耕经验
    伯明
            （一）笨鸟先飞早动手
    今年元旦日，县政府给各村的拜年信上即提出克服怕富思想，“不贪污、不恶霸、发财露头怕什么”，惊蛰后又在村干部会上号召积极春耕，当时各村干部都保证在十天内完成犁地、送粪、准备参战。结果全县提前半个月完成春耕下种，迅速转入纺织、运输等副业生产。
    当时有些什么思想妨碍早动手呢？第一、“今年春深日月长，润二月不用忙”，“闲正月游二月，溜溜达达是三月”等拖拉思想普遍存在。第二、等下雨等牲口，等男人支差回来种。“人办做不完，天办一顿饭，只要老天爷下雨不用你急”，“春天就没有妇女的生活”，“妇女们不算活，小脚脚把地也踏实啦”。第三、干部认为工作忙没工夫领导生产。总之，不进行组织一切没有办法下手，因此领导上首先以算劳力账办法，除了参战远差民兵外，全村还有多少劳力牲口，其次算生活账，全村土地、粪土及参战人员共有多少生活；再算时间账，清明到谷雨还有多少长时间，给大家打开脑筋，仔细盘算一下如何办。接着又表扬群众与干部间的积极思想与行动，“笨鸟先飞早动手”，“宁抢三月土，不抢四月湿”，“宁叫人等雨不叫雨等人”，“停纺又停织，种罢再纺织”，以群众的经验教育群众。
            （二）临时突击与经常互助
    在突击春耕的过程中，全县组织起临时互助组六千三百一十二组，据七个区的统计（缺一、五区）组织起来突击春耕的人数有七万零六百六十五人。六区六千八百六十户中，有六千七百七十户参加了互助组。八区全区仅一百三十八户未参加互助。全县六千多个互助组，均能在春耕中结合副业生产，而保持经常互助者四百九十五组。领导上便及时提出将临时互助坚持下去，以经常互助的好的典型示范全县，给别人学习。
            （三）结合互助组
    此类互助组以三区的廖胡村，八区的北坡村、张路口，二区西郜村为代表。群众创造了生产与参战，农业与副业结合的办法，其特点是（一）参战第一，一切为了前线的胜利，奖励参战民夫，一工增二分。并保证先给参战人员耕种好。
    从农副业变工到农副业合作，西郜村规定纺四两上等纱顶工一个工，缝一件布衫顶两个半工，纳一双底子顶四个工。北坡与张路口村互助组，抽一二人与两三头牲口出去运输，红利二八批，二成归运输人与牲口，八成归互助组。组内股东得四成，其余四成按劳力强弱批，十分工者得十分，七分工者得七分，使互助组更为完备。现在全村已将铁工、织妇、蹄炉、小炉匠与农业互助组合组成个大的合作工厂。副业收入全部归组，按劳分红，农民全劳力一天顶一工，织布丈五顶一工，揽窑两晌顶一工，小炉匠外出一天顶一工，不论农民、工人均在所得工数减去自己土地上所需工数，余工分红，有特殊成绩者提奖。
            （四）发动妇女参加农业劳动
    发动妇女参加农业劳动以八区为最好，全区六千三百四十五个劳动妇女中，已组织起二千八百七十人，达到组织起来的原因：一、领导上普遍的进行了思想动员，打通妇女靠男人与劳力怕丑的思想，号召男人前线立功，妇女后方生产。二、积极分子带头，桥西村干部张江水首先动员自己的女人上地，然后再动员别人，影响邻居，很快的组织起来。三、时时鼓励，河村的妇女上了“劳动人报”后，陟椒的妇女就一再叫区干部去她们的互助组里检查工作。四、实行同工同酬。
