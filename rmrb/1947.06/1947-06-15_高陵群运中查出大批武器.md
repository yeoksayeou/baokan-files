During the mass movement in Gaoling, large quantities of weapons were found
[Report from this newspaper in the border region of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, dated 11th] In the newly recovered Gaoling County, during the land reform, a large number of weapons buried by landlords were uncovered. In one week, the Fifth District alone cleared out 32 rifles, over 100 single-shot guns, 150 hand grenades, and 1,250 rounds of ammunition. The liberated peasants used these to arm themselves. Every militiaman has a weapon, and they stand guard day and night, investigating bad elements and capturing special agents.
