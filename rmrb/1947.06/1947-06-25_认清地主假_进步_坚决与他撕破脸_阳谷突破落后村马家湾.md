　　Recognize the Landlord's False "Progress"
    Resolutely Break with Him
    Yanggu Breaks Through the Backward Village of Majiawan
    [Report from this newspaper's Jilu Yu office on the 23rd] In Yanggu County's Majiawan, land is relatively scattered. Out of the village's 92 households, only 8 households, including Xue Yuzhen's, are small landlords, 50 are middle peasants, 14 are poor peasants, and 2 are rich peasants. In the past, everyone said that Majiawan was a poor village, and that those few landlord families were bankrupt landlords. Everyone felt there was nothing to be gained, and the masses had never been mobilized. This time, the Second District, First Sub-district convened a peasant congress, setting off a review competition, with villages challenging each other, and Majiawan was also swept into the tide. After returning to the village, the first step was to reach a consensus within the Party branch, discussing whether the landlords were truly "progressive." What methods are they using today to sabotage? After everyone had a clear understanding of the landlords, they further strengthened their position and resolved to eliminate the landlords, believing that where there are landlords, there is no us, and where there is us, there are no landlords. Then, within the peasant association, meetings were held separately for three types of people: First, a meeting of poor peasants was held to reflect on the past, compare it with the present, and consider why a review was necessary and whether they had truly overturned their situation, in order to establish core activists for the movement. Second, a meeting of middle peasants was held to clarify the middle peasant policy, dispel concerns, and further express grievances, so that everyone could recognize that poor peasants and middle peasants were all oppressed people and should unite to conduct a review against the landlords. Third, a meeting of "running dogs" was held to call on them to reflect, expose past mistakes, and point out that there were only two paths: one was to follow the landlords to a dead end, facing opposition from the masses; the other was to break with the landlords, unite with the masses, and participate in the review to find a way out. Subsequently, a village-wide meeting was convened, and the leadership let the masses discuss the matter themselves in groups, clarifying who should be reviewed and who should "move stones." After this was made clear, the masses' enthusiasm surged. At this time, when the leadership asked who dared to act boldly, who dared to reason with the landlords, who would be a people's hero, who would be a model for the masses, a wave of challenges emerged. When the investigation began, the masses beat drums and gongs, carrying iron shovels and wooden shovels, vying to participate, and the place was packed. After several days of investigation, searching for things during the day and holding meetings at night, the masses' enthusiasm was extremely high from beginning to end. A total of 150 pieces of silk clothing, 500 pieces of coarse cloth, and gold, silver, jade, agate, ancient porcelain, etc., were found, totaling more than 4.5 million yuan in ocean currency. After this review, 80% of the masses in the village have been mobilized.

　　认清地主假“进步”
    坚决与他撕破脸
    阳谷突破落后村马家湾
    【本报冀鲁豫廿三日电】阳谷县马家湾土地比较分散，全村九十二户中仅薛玉珍等八户是小地主，中农五十户，贫农十四户，富农二户，过去人人都说马家湾是个贫村，那几家地主又是破产地主，大家都认为没啥搞头，群众一直没有发动起来。这次二区一小区召开农民大会，掀起复查竞赛，村村挑战，马家湾也卷入热潮。回村之后，首先在支部中打通思想，讨论地主是否真“进步”？他今天用什么办法进行破坏，大家对地主认识清楚之后，进一步坚定立场，决心消灭地主，认为有地主就没有我们，有我们就没有地主。然后在农会内分别召开三种人会议：第一、召开贫农会，想想过去，比比现在，为啥复查？是否翻身透了？以树立运动骨干。第二、召开中农会，阐明中农政策，打破顾虑，进一步诉了苦，使大家都认识贫农、中农都是被压迫的人，应该团结一致向地主进行复查。第三、召开“狗腿”会，叫他们反省，把过去的错误揭露，并指出只有两条道路，一条跟地主走是死路，遭到群众反对；一条与地主撕破脸和群众团结，参加复查是活路。接着又召开全村大会，领导上放手让群众自己讨论，分组酝酿，谁该查，谁该“搬石头”，明确之后，群众情绪高涨，这时领导上一提出谁敢大胆干，谁敢与地主撕破脸讲理，谁就是人民功臣，谁就是群众的模范。于是群众挑战形成热潮，清查开始，群众打着锣鼓，拿着铁锹木掀，争先恐后参加，挤得水泄不通，经数天清查，白天找东西，黑夜开会，从始至终，群众情绪极高涨，共查出绸子衣服一百五十件，粗洋布五百件，金银玉器玛瑙古磁器等，计合洋四百五十余万元。经这次进行复查后，全村群众已发动百分之八十。
