　　Outburst of Anger
    A True Account of the "May 20th" Parade by Students in Beiping and Tianjin
  Ten Thousand People Roar, Shaking Beiping
    The "May 20th" anti-civil war parade by students in Beiping and Tianjin was extremely magnificent and vivid. In Beiping, participating schools included Peking University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Peiyang University, Sino-French University, Chaoyang University, Railway College, Medical College, Teachers College, Beiping Normal School, Girls' No. 2 Middle School, Girls' No. 3 Middle School, Wenman Middle School, Huiwen Middle School, Girls' High School Affiliated to Normal University, Yu Ying School, and National No. 1 Midwifery School, totaling over ten thousand people. In Tianjin, despite various obstacles set by the Chiang Kai-shek authorities beforehand, participants still included Nankai University, Peiyang University, Hebei Institute of Technology, Baoding Industrial School, Nankai University Affiliated High School, and various middle schools. In the procession of Tsinghua University in Beiping, there were also hundreds of demobilized students who had participated in the Youth Expeditionary Force, wearing their original American military uniforms, war medals, and steel helmets, forming a "Youth Expeditionary Force Brigade" leading the way.
    The Beiping students marched in rows of three, with one disciplinary officer for every three rows, and also had propaganda teams, petition groups, external liaison, and medical teams.
    The parade began at 1:40 PM. The propaganda team distributed leaflets along the way, writing slogans such as "Oppose civil war, oppose hunger!", "Seek peace!", "Organize a democratic coalition government!", "Oppose grain requisition and conscription!", "Improve the treatment of public school teachers!" on walls and store entrances. The students sang songs such as "You Bad Thing" and "Oppose Civil War." When they reached Xidan, Deng Xiao, a student from Peiyang University in the liaison group, drove ahead and was suddenly surrounded and beaten by more than 30 Chiang Kai-shek special agents disguised as students. They were tied to a tree with rope, and brutally beaten with iron bars, iron wires, hemp ropes, and flails made of cloth strips. Deng was severely injured, covered in blood, and in critical condition. A few minutes later, another student, Hu Jiezong, was also surrounded and beaten by plainclothes agents. As the marching column continued to advance, Chiang's special agent thugs threw bricks and tiles, attempting to disrupt the procession, but the students finally passed through calmly.
    At about 3 PM, they petitioned at the Chiang government's Beiping Pacification Headquarters in Zhongnanhai. Li Zongren sent a certain Mr. Li, a deputy director of the adjutant's office, to receive them. The students raised five demands, but this person brushed them all aside, achieving nothing. For example, when the students demanded punishment for the perpetrators, he said, "It is under investigation"; when the students demanded compensation and an apology, he said, "The Pacification Headquarters is not responsible"; when the students demanded the allocation of food raw materials to public and private schools, he said, "It needs to be considered" or "There is none."
    At about 7 PM, the procession returned to the Red Building Square of Peking University, where students who had stayed at the school warmly applauded them. The school gate was hung with a large slogan: "You have triumphed, great warriors!" After the students from various schools gathered, the presidium reported on the Xidan incident and the petition process. The students were extremely agitated, and immediately decided that the "Anti-Civil War and Anti-Hunger Movement" was just beginning and would not compromise halfway. They also decided to start an Anti-Civil War Week on June 2nd, calling on the whole country to strike from classes, work, teaching, and the market, and rename Peking University's Red Building Square as "Democracy Square."
    That evening, the North China Anti-Civil War and Anti-Hunger Student Federation continued to hold a representative meeting at Peking University, deciding to continue the strike for one day on the 22nd (including Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan). On the evening of the 21st, the Yenching Student Union also held a meeting and resolved, in addition to continuing the strike for one day on the 22nd, to strive for soldiers to jointly participate in the Anti-Civil War and Anti-Hunger Movement, and to raise donations to comfort the injured and parading students.
  Tianjin Students Advance Through Bricks and Stones
    The Tianjin student parade procession was divided into two groups, one led by Nankai University and the other by Peiyang University.
    When the Nankai University parade was about to depart, Chen Xujing, Dean of Studies, and Bao Juemin, Dean of Students, attempted to dissuade them from changing the parade plan to an on-campus activity. The student union representatives replied, "The parade is a resolution of all the students, and the student union cannot violate the will of all." The two then spoke with all the students. Bao asked, "Can everyone not go out today?" All the students unanimously replied, "No."
    They gathered and departed at 9:30 AM. A banner in front of the team read: "North China Students Anti-Civil War and Anti-Hunger Joint Parade." Behind the banner was a square area with the words "Civil War Doesn't Stop, Hunger Doesn't End." After that, it was written: "The Constitution of the Republic of China stipulates that the people have the freedom of assembly, association, belief, speech, and petition." As soon as the marching column walked not far out of the school gate, hundreds of Chiang Kai-shek thugs, each holding short sticks, belts, and bricks, rushed towards them. Seeing that the situation was not right, the marching column adjusted its head and planned to change course, but Chiang's special agents had already approached the column, shouting the slanderous slogans of "Oppose the strike" and "Down with the Communist Party's running dogs," while throwing bricks and stones like rain, and violently attacking the student union representatives who came forward to negotiate. The police also held batons and joined the thugs in the violence on the street. The students were forced to retreat back to the school. Twenty students were injured and six were arrested. The students immediately held a meeting to discuss rescuing the arrested students. Speakers were sobbing and weeping.
    Another team of students from Peiyang and other schools departed at 8:20 AM. The banners in front and behind the procession read: "Oppose Civil War!" "Petition for the People!" The propaganda team conducted propaganda to the onlookers along the way, distributing the "Letter to Fellow Industrial and Commercial Compatriots." The students shouted slogans and sang songs. When the procession reached Jingang Bridge, it was once blocked by the police. The students immediately launched street propaganda, starting with "Why is corn flour so expensive?" Applause was constantly heard from the crowd, and many policemen also expressed sympathy for the students. After negotiation, the procession continued to advance. The parading students applauded the police to express their gratitude, and the onlookers also applauded, a very touching scene.
    At about 10 AM, the team went straight to Roosevelt Road when a team of hundreds of "masses" disguised as Chiang's special agents came head-on, shouting "Oppose the strike," forcing the students to return to school. Peiyang students came forward to reason, and were immediately scolded as "Soviet running dogs." Immediately, iron rulers, belts, wooden sticks, and bricks and stones flew together, and the student procession was dispersed. Chiang's police drove prison vans and arrested more than a dozen of the beaten students. But the students persevered and gathered again. After petitioning the Tianjin Chiang government, they began to return to school in formation. The professors of various schools were very saddened and indignant about this. Nankai University professors immediately donated more than three million yuan in their impoverished lives to comfort the students.
  Who is Disrupting Order?
    As soon as the parade strike began, the Chiang government used the excuse of so-called "maintaining social order" to brutally suppress the students' anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement. But in fact, the parading students were orderly, and the ones who disrupted "social order" were precisely the special agent thugs and police instigated by the Chiang authorities. For example, the Tianjin Dagongbao headlined the Beiping "May 20th" student parade as: "Ten Thousand People in Beiping Procession, High Morale and Strict Order, Calmly Passing Through Obstruction at Xidan", "The Team Abides by Discipline, Bricks and Tiles Fly Randomly at Xidan, The Procession Advances Calmly", "Students Endure Insult and Beating, Masses Deeply Moved". The news content described: "Solemn, dignified, and enthusiastic, although there were many people, they maintained even higher discipline than during the 'Anti-Tyranny' movement, everyone spontaneously raised their vigilance and obedience." Tianjin Yishibao also headlined: "Ping Students Procession Orderly." The Tianjin Peiyang University parade was described by Yishibao as: "The student team proceeded slowly, with good order." When the Peiyang parade procession was attacked head-on by Chiang's special agent thugs on Roosevelt Road, the students, fearing an accident, automatically asked the Chiang police inspector at the rear of the team to "maintain order."
    For example, before the Nankai students departed, the student union representatives announced on the spot: (1) After departure, the integrity of the formation must be absolutely maintained; (2) Except for the prescribed slogans, no other sounds are allowed to be made arbitrarily, especially "beat" and "boo"; (3) In the event of any incidents on the way, wait patiently for a solution; (4) The chief leader has the power to promulgate emergency measures, and all must obey; (5) Only the chief leader has the right to speak to the outside world, and no student is allowed to talk to outsiders. This is truly full democracy, fully organized, fully orderly, and fully accommodating.
    In contrast, the Chiang authorities instigated thugs to rampage, slander and insult, and brutally beat and arrest students, doing everything possible to disrupt order. The Chiang police not only did not stop them, but also helped the thugs. When Chiang's special agents in Beiping beat Peiyang student Deng Xiao in Xidan, the Dagongbao wrote: "The unarmed military police witnessed Deng being beaten, but did not intervene, and the stores were panicked and closed their doors." When the Tianjin Peiyang parading students were beaten by Chiang's special agent thugs on Roosevelt Road, Yishibao described this group of "masses" as: "Walking quickly, passing from the left side of the students, shouting slogans such as "Oppose the strike," "Support the National Government," and "Down with the Communist Party." This team of masses had no uniforms, no flags, and when reporters asked about their origins, they replied with words such as "citizens" or "don't know," numbering around six hundred people." When this group of "masses" violently beat students with iron rulers, wooden sticks, bricks and tiles, Yishibao also described: "As the police whistle sounded, the police also mixed into the chaos and arrested a total of seventeen students, escorting them to the police station." As for what this group of "masses" actually was, it can also be seen from the following passage in Yishibao: "The parading masses obtained the Peiyang national flag, lined up and sang the party song (Kuomintang song), and the traffic police blew their whistles, ordering pedestrians to stand at attention when they heard the song." In Chiang Kai-shek's view, it is probably only this kind of insulting and beating, and the special agent procession that forces people to stand at attention, that maintains his social order!
  "Turn Grief into Strength!"
    In this parade, the Tianjin Peiyang University injured students included Zeng Yingyun, Ma Ruliang, Chen Zhifan, Qian Xilai, Chen Chuan, Liu Zenglai, and Zhang Zhaolan. Among them, Zeng and Ma were the most seriously injured, coughing up blood. Zeng's injury was "chest contusion," and Ma's injury was "concussion." Deng Xiao, the seriously injured student in Beiping, was the son of Deng Rimo, a professor at Tianjin Peiyang.
    The injured were not only students. When Tianjin Chiang's special agents chased and beat a student wearing a yellow khaki uniform on Roosevelt Road, they rushed into the Tianjin Finance Bureau and beat anyone wearing yellow clothes indiscriminately, like mad dogs. The violence lasted for twenty-five minutes before they swaggered away, and the Chiang police only watched from the sidelines. As a result, eighteen or nineteen employees and citizens were injured, three of whom were seriously injured. Employee Kong Xianrui was the most seriously injured, bleeding from the heart, and his life was in danger.
    However, beatings cannot suppress the students. They are fighting bravely. When Nankai students were beaten by Chiang's special agents, a slender student was hit in the back of the head with a stone, and the wound was as big as a thumb, and blood was flowing non-stop. Three other people carried him back, and he was already unconscious. Another student was also carried back, his neck and @ covered in blood. His hoarse voice kept shouting: "Don't worry about me, it doesn't matter, Little Zhang was taken away by them, go chase him!"
    The injured students were carried back, and the students sat in the courtyard sobbing. The female students were busy bandaging the wounds of the injured, and the squad leaders were busy counting the lost comrades. A hand wrapped in white bandages waved, and lips smeared with mercurochrome shouted: "We must turn grief into anger, and anger into strength!" The tired students immediately responded with a burst of thunderous applause.

　　怒火的爆发
    平津学生“五·二○”游行纪实
  万人怒吼震北平
    “五、二○”平津学生反内战游行情况是极为壮烈生动的。北平方面，参加的学校有北大、燕京、清华、辅仁、北洋、中法、朝阳、铁路学院、医专、师院、北平师范、女二中、女三中、文满、汇文、女附中、育英、国立第一助产学校等校共万余人。天津方面虽因事前被蒋家当局多方阻难，参加者仍有南大、北洋、河北工学院、保定工业学校、南大附中及各中学等。北平清华大学行列中并有曾参加青年从军的退伍返校学生数百人，穿着原来从军时的美式戎衣，佩带战功勋章，头戴钢盔，组成“从军青年大队”领头进行。
    北平学生游行三人一列，每三列有纠察队一人，另有宣传队、请愿团、对外联络、救护等组织。
    自下午一时四十分开始游行，宣传组沿途分发传单，在墙壁及商店门口书写“反内战、反饥饿！”“求和平！”“组织民主联合政府！”“反对征实征兵！”“提高公教人员待遇！”等标语。同学们高唱着：《你这个坏东西》，《反对内战》等歌曲。到西单时，联络组北洋大学学生邓宵行车先行，突遭蒋特化装的学生三十余人包围殴打，并用绳反绑于树上，用铁棍及铁丝、麻绳、布条缠成之狼牙棒乱加毒打，邓被打得遍体鳞伤，鲜血淋漓，极为严重。数分钟后，另一学生胡节中亦被便衣特务包围殴打受伤。游行大队继续前进中，蒋特暴徒又抛砖掷瓦，企图扰乱行列，但是学生们终于沉着通过。
    三时许在中南海蒋政府北平行辕请愿，由李宗仁派了一个副官处长李某接见。学生提出五项要求，此人条条推开，毫无结果。如：学生要求惩凶，此人说“在追究中”；学生要求赔偿道歉，则谓“行辕不负责任”；学生要求配发各公私立学校食粮原料，则“须考虑”或“无有”。
    七时许行列回到北大红楼广场，留校同学热烈鼓掌欢迎，校门悬有大字标语：“你们凯旋了，伟大的战士！”各校学生齐集后，主席团报告西单事件及请愿经过，学生情绪十分激昂，当时就决定：“反内战反饥饿运动”正在开始，决不中途妥协；并决定自六月二日起为反内战周，呼吁全国罢课、罢工、罢教、罢市，改北大红楼广场为“民主广场”。
    当天晚上华北区反内战反饥饿学生联合会继续在北大举行代表会议，决定二十二日继续罢课一天（包括平津及唐山）。二十一日晚燕京自治会也开会决议，除二十二日继续罢课一日外，并通过争取士兵共同参加反内战反饥饿运动及募捐慰问受伤及游行学生等决议。
  天津学生冒砖石前进
    天津学生游行行列分两起，一由南开大学领头，一由北洋大学领头。
    南开大学游行将出发时，南大教务长陈序经，训导长鲍觉民曾企图劝阻改变游行计划为校内活动，学生自治会代表回答说：“游行是全体同学的决议，自治会不能违背全体意志”。二氏就和全体同学谈话，鲍氏问：“今天大家可不可以不出去？”全体同学一致答：“不可以”。
    上午九时半集合出发。队前一横幅书：“华北学生反内战反饥饿联合大游行”，幅后一方区，上书“内战不停，饥饿不止”八字，其后又写：“中华民国宪法中规定人民有集会、结社、信仰、言论、请愿之自由”。游行行列刚走出校门不远，就有蒋特暴徒数百人，各手执短棍、皮带、砖头蜂拥迎面而来，游行行列见情势不对，就调队头，打算改道而行，而蒋特等已逼近行列，一面狂呼“反对罢课”及“打倒中共走狗”的栽诬口号，一面即砖石齐飞，有如雨下，并凶殴上前和他们交涉的学生自治会代表。警察也持警棍伙同暴徒街上参加暴行。学生被迫即退回校内，计有学生二十人受伤，六人被逮捕，同学当即开会商讨救援被捕同学，发言者皆泣不成声，呜咽四起。
    另一队北洋等校学生于八时二十分出发，行列前后大书：“反对内战！”“为民请命！”宣传小组沿途对围观市民进行宣传，散发“告工商同胞书”学生则狂呼口号，高唱歌曲。行列至金刚桥时一度为警察所拦阻，学生当即展开街头宣传，由“棒子面为什么这样贵”说起，群众中不断发出掌声，警察亦多表示同情学生。经过交涉后行列继续前进，游行学生并向警察鼓掌表示感谢，围观群众亦纷纷鼓掌，情景极为感人。
    十时许大队直至罗斯福路时，一队蒋特化装的数百“群众”又迎面而来，大叫“反对罢课”，迫使学生返校，北洋学生出面论理，即被骂为“苏联的走狗”，立刻铁尺、皮带、木棒、砖石齐飞，学生行列当被打散，蒋记警察更驾囚车赶到，反捕去被殴的学生十余人。但学生再接再厉，旋又集合至津蒋记市政府请愿后始整队回校。各校教授对此都很悲愤，南大教授在困穷生活中立即捐出三百余万元慰问学生。
  是谁破坏秩序？
    游行罢课一开始，蒋政府就借口所谓“维持社会秩序”，对学生反内战反饥饿运动横蛮压迫，但实际上游行学生秩序井然，而破坏“社会秩序”者正是蒋当局嗾使下的特务暴徒与警察。例如天津大公报对北平“五、二○”学生游行的标题是：“北平万人行列，情绪激昂秩序严整，西单遇阻沉着通过”，“队伍恪守纪律，西单砖瓦乱飞，行列沉着前进”，“学生忍辱挨打，群众深受感动”。新闻内容则描绘着：“庄严、肃穆及热情，人数虽多，但是保有比‘抗暴’运动时更高的纪律，每个人是自发地提高了警觉与服从”。天津益世报亦标为：“平学生行列整齐”。津北洋大学之游行，益世报描绘为：“学生大队徐徐进行，秩序良好”。当北洋游行行列于罗斯福路遭蒋特暴徒迎面冲来时，学生恐有意外，更自动请压队之蒋记警局督察“维持秩序”。
    又如南大学生出发以前，自治会代表当场宣布：（一）出发后须绝对保持队形的完整；（二）除规定之口号外，不准任意发出其他声音，尤不准喊“打”及“嘘”；（三）途中遭遇任何事件时须以耐性静待解决；（四）总领队有颁布紧急措施之权力，全体均须遵从；（五）对外只有总领队有发言权，任何同学不准与外人接谈。这真是充分民主，充分有组织，充分有秩序，而且充分委曲求全。
    反观蒋当局方面，则嗾使暴徒横冲直撞，诬蔑谩骂，残酷殴打逮捕学生，极尽其破坏秩序之多事，而蒋方警察不但不予以制止，更从而施处助暴。北平蒋特在西单殴打北洋学生邓宵时，大公报写着：“徒手宪警目睹邓之被殴，亦未过问，一时商店均惊惶关门”。天津北洋游行学生在罗斯福路被蒋特暴徒殴打时，益世报描写此批“群众”道：“疾行前进，由学生左侧超过，高呼“反对罢课”，“拥护国民政府”，“打倒共产党”等口号，此队群众，无制服，无旗帜，记者叩询来历，辄答以“市民”或“不知道”等语，为数在六百人之谱。”当这批“群众”各用铁尺、木棍、砖瓦凶殴学生时，益世报又描写着：“警笛一鸣，警察亦混入乱局，并逮捕学生共计有十七人，解往警局”。至这批“群众”究竟是什么东西，亦可从益世报下面一段描写看出：“游行群众获得北洋国旗，列队合唱党歌（国民党歌），交通警并鸣警笛，勒令行人闻歌立正”。在蒋介石看来，大概只有这种侮辱殴打，并强人立正的特务行列，才是维持着他的社会秩序！
  “把愤恨变成力量！”
    这次游行中，天津北洋大学受伤同学有曾映云、马汝良、陈之凡、钱锡来、陈川、刘增来、张兆兰七人，其中曾马受伤最重，咯血不止，曾之伤为“胸部挫伤”，马之伤为“脑震荡”。北平受伤严重之同学邓宵，为津北洋教授邓日谟氏的公子。
    受伤的也不止是学生，当天津蒋特于罗斯福路追打一穿黄色卡叽服学生时，冲入天津财政局内，见穿黄色衣服的人即行殴打，不分皂白，如同疯狗，暴行历时二十五分钟始扬长而去，蒋记警察仅在旁观望而已。结果受伤职员市民达十八九人，其中三人重伤，职员孔宪瑞伤势最重，心脏出血，有性命之忧。
    然而殴打是镇压不住学生们的。他们英勇地斗争着。南大同学被蒋特殴打时，一个细长同学后脑壳上中了一个石块，伤口有姆指那么大，血流不止，另外三个人把他抬了回去，已经不省人事了，另一同学也被抬了回来，颈子上、两＠涂满鲜血，他哑了的嗓子不住叫着：“不要管我，没有关系，小张叫他们架走了，快去追！”
    受伤的同学抬回来了，学生们坐在院子里呜咽着，女同学忙着给伤者裹扎伤口，小队长们忙着清点失去的伙伴。一只缠着白绷带的手挥动起来，红药水涂抹着的嘴唇喊着：“我们要把悲痛变成愤恨，把愤恨变成力量！”疲倦了的同学们立刻报以一阵霹雳似的掌声。
