　　"Progressive Landlord" Exposes True Colors
    Hiding Weapons and Plotting "Counter-Attack"
    Masses With Clear Eyes Arrest Him
    [Our Dispatch] Gao Miao Wang Village in Yanggu's First District is a typical feudal stronghold. Landlords occupy 13 out of the village's 165 households. Their reactionary representative, Zhu Hansheng, was a receiver for the KMT's traitorous Northeast after the Japanese surrender. He colluded with the enemy to assassinate active members of the farmers' association. After the county town was liberated, the landlord Zhu Xicheng still concealed himself at home with a seemingly progressive appearance, expressing closeness to the government. Consequently, some comrades, with a blind eye, considered him a "progressive person to be won over and united," constantly calling on him to participate in some temporary shock work (such as collecting contributions for the army). After the land reform movement started, he outwardly complied with laws and regulations in the manner of a progressive person, dealing with cadres and the masses. On the other hand, he secretly sent his brother Zhu Xihua and his "lackeys" to infiltrate the farmers' association, grasping the sectarian backward elements internally, attempting to seize full power. Before the wheat harvest, his plot to use his "lackeys" to overthrow the farmers' association and elect him as chairman was discovered by the masses. He was arrested, and his family property was sealed up. After interrogation by the Public Security Bureau, it was found that he was also harboring three Mauser pistols with two magazines each and forty rounds of ammunition from fleeing landlords of Xu Village in Nanfeng, one handgun with sixty rounds of ammunition, one five-tiger spear, one six-round revolver, and 300 rounds of ammunition for rifles. The masses, seeing these landlords' murder weapons, were extremely indignant. The village farmers' association chairman immediately convened a mass meeting, and everyone angrily said to each other: "If this guy is hiding this, who is he saving it to kill if not us?! We can't be paralyzed! Open your eyes!" The true face of the "progressive landlord" has been exposed, and the movement is continuing to deepen. (Yanggu People)

    【本报讯】阳谷一区高庙王庄，是一个典型的封建堡垒，全村一六五户人家，地主就占十三家，他们的反动代表朱汉生，日寇投降后曾为蒋记卖国的东北接收委员，曾勾结敌人暗杀了农会积极分子，县城解放后地主朱希成仍以表面进步的面目隐蔽在家，表示靠近政府，因而一般同志也就眯着眼睛认为是“进步人士，争取团结对象”，不断叫他参加一些临时的突击工作，（如征收拥军），土改运动起来后，他一面以进步者的口吻，遵守法令，应付干部和群众，一面又暗地派他兄弟朱希化和他的“狗腿”打入农会掌握内里的宗派落后分子，企图把持全权，麦前他指使其“狗腿”打垮农会，选他为会长的阴谋被群众发觉了，并把他捕起来，家财封起来，经公安局审讯，查出他还窝藏着南峰许寨逃亡地主的二把匣枪三支，子弹四十条，手枪一支，子弹六十粒，五虎枪一支，六轮枪一支，大枪火三百发，群众看到了这些地主的杀人凶器，十分愤恨。村农会长马上召集群众开会，大家都相互愤恨的说：“这小子藏着这个，不是留着杀咱是杀谁的？！可不能麻痹！睁开眼吧！”“进步地主”的真面目暴露了，现运动在继续深入中。（阳谷人民）
