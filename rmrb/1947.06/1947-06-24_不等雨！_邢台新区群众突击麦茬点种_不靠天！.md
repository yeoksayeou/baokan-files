　　Not Waiting for Rain!
    Masses in Xingtai New District Rush to Plant on Wheat Stubble
    Not Relying on Heaven!
    [This newspaper, Xingtai] After the wheat harvest, the majority of villages in the New District broke the old habit of sun-drying wheat stubble, organized labor to rush planting. In the First and Second Districts, where water conservancy could be utilized, they actively repaired canals and installed seedlings; the main canal in Changxin Village has been completed, and the branch canals have begun, and 4,000 mu of land will be planted with crops. Wangma Village completed a canal in one day, turning 70 mu of dry land into irrigated land. The four villages west of the railway line that have wells are using well water to irrigate the land for planting, and Hou Lizi Village in the Third District completed planting on 600 mu of land in two days. Xidong Village carries water to spot-plant in areas that cannot be irrigated, planting 44 mu of seedlings in two days, and also made a guarantee to ensure that none of them die. Although there is no water available in Xishawo in the Fourth District and Dongbaishan in the Fifth District, they have both harrowed the wheat fields and applied fertilizer. Xishawo harrowed 1,000 mu of wheat fields in two days and finished applying fertilizer in one day. The masses who have been emancipated have demonstrated their enthusiasm in production. Although it has not rained yet, they are full of energy and determined to fight the drought to the end. (Chang Yan)

　　不等雨！
    邢台新区群众突击麦茬点种
    不靠天！
    【本报邢台讯】新区群众在麦收后，大部村庄打破了晒麦茬的旧习惯，组织劳力突击下种，一、二区可利用水利的地方，积极修渠安苗；长信村大渠已完成，支渠已开始，四千亩地将要种上庄稼。王麻村一天即完成一道渠，七十亩旱地成水地。路西四个就有井的利用井水浇地下种，三区后里子两天完成六百亩地的下种。西董村把浇不到的地，担水点种，二天栽苗四十四亩，还提出保证出来，保证不死。四区西沙窝、五区东柏山虽无水可用，但都把麦地耙了送了粪，西沙窝两天耙麦地一千亩，一天把粪送完。在生产中都表现了翻身群众的积极性，虽至今未雨，可是都是劲头十足，决与旱灾战斗到底。（昌言）
