    3. From a Minority to a Majority

    Praising heroes and models is the best kind of education and criticism. It can stimulate the righteousness, enthusiasm, and creativity of the masses. However, heroes and models are always only a minority. If heroes and models are not good at taking care of the level of the masses, it will be difficult to bring all the masses along. On the contrary, they may be satirized by backward elements. After the launch of the blackboard newspapers and the movement to remember the good and learn well, not only can heroes and models be praised, but also the broad masses of middle-of-the-road elements can be praised, and backward elements who are willing to make progress can also be praised. The majority of people are praised, which creates an atmosphere of finding the good and learning from it, and creates a great force of the masses. This force prompts backward elements to be anxious to remember the good, and they no longer have the courage to satirize others. An organization cadre in the Yi character political department was saddened to see that all the comrades in his department had been recorded as "good." As a result, he wrote a self-reflection on the blackboard newspaper, examining his shortcomings and expressing his determination to strive for a "good" record. A squad leader in the propaganda team, because of his random and strange remarks, was not recorded as "good" while everyone else was. He himself brought it up: "I don't make strange remarks anymore. I'm seeking progress, so why don't you give me a 'good' record?" After discussion, he was given a "good" record retroactively. After being recorded as "good," he became even more active.

    Some old soldiers who were very brave in battle but sloppy in their daily work have now changed. Several newly liberated soldiers from the Third Company of the Bin character unit were recorded as "good." Soldiers who had joined the army voluntarily said, "People who were liberated were recorded as 'good,' but we who came voluntarily have fallen behind. We must work hard to catch up."

    The number of people recorded as "good" is often above 70%. Everyone envies and is happy for those who are recorded as "good," but there is no jealousy. Because no one needs to be envious or jealous, the criteria for being recorded as "good" are not as high as the conditions for being a hero or model, and everyone has ample opportunities. When the troops were advancing westward, the leadership proposed to save civilian labor and reduce the number of large carts. One Liu Desheng had eight blisters on his feet, but still firmly refused to ride in a large cart. However, there was also Zhang Liangxing, who only had two small blisters, but insisted on riding in a large cart. The blackboard newspaper praised Liu Desheng. Next to it was a cartoon of a skinny donkey pulling a broken cart, with a soldier lying on it, looking smug and saying, "I like to ride in a large cart." Zhang Liangxing, who was originally thick-skinned, blushed this time. The next day, he didn't ride again. The blackboard newspaper immediately praised him by name, and he never rode in a cart again. The unit completely eliminated large carts. Even the company administrator was surprised. He wrote an article titled "The Blackboard Newspaper Replaced the Large Cart."

    One battalion counted that the blackboard newspaper and the movement to remember the good and learn well had transformed a total of 48 backward elements, of whom 21 had become activists. Another battalion's direct subordinate unit cultivated 96 candidates for Party membership in the blackboard newspaper and the movement to remember the good and learn well.

    The blackboard newspaper and the movement to remember the good and learn well improved the middle-of-the-road elements, greatly enhanced the leading role of activists, and provided great help to the leadership. The discipline in the dining hall of the health department was not very good. Many articles criticized this phenomenon. One article said, "The leaders have already announced the dining hall discipline, so why don't you abide by it? I have no other way, so I can only speak up on the blackboard newspaper." The next day, this comrade wrote another article titled "Still No Change Today." And he pointed out names. After that, the dining hall discipline became very good. Backward elements don't care about criticism from superiors, but they pay attention to criticism on the blackboard newspaper, because they feel that superiors may have prejudices against them, but everyone's eyes are correct. Many leaders, administrators, and other military administrative cadres, realizing the help that the blackboard newspaper and the movement to remember the good and learn well provided to their work, became enthusiastic and responsible editors of the blackboard newspaper.

    Correspondent Guo Shan had participated in the revolution for seven years, but because he was mischievous and awkward, did not like to study, and did not seek progress, he recently changed. Once, he said gratefully, "Blackboard newspaper, blackboard newspaper, if you had come a few years earlier, I would have become a cadre long ago."

　　门板报与记好学好运动（续完）

    ３、从少数到多数
    表扬英雄模范是一种最好的教育与批评，可以激发群众的正气、积极性与创造性，然而英雄模范总只少数。如果英雄模范不善于照顾群众的水平，就很难把群众全部都带领起来，相反的，也许会遭到落后分子的讽刺。门板报与记好学好运动开展后，不仅英雄模范能得到表扬，广大的中间分子也能得到表扬，愿意进步的落后分子也能得到表扬。多数人都被表扬了，这就造成了一种找好、学好的风气，造成了一种伟大的群众力量。这种力量促使着落后分子也急着想记个好，再也没有勇气来讽刺别人了。毅字政治部有一位组织干事看见本科的同志都记上好了，他心里很难过，结果在门板报上写了篇反省，检讨自己的缺点，表示决心要争取记好。宣传队有一位分队长，因为乱讲怪话，大家都记了好没有记他，他自己提出来“我现在不讲怪话啦，我求进步，为什么不给我记好？”讨论之后，给他补记了好，记好之后他就变得更积极了。
    有少数的老战士，打仗很勇敢，平时工作马马虎虎，现在都变了。斌字部三连几个新解放来的战士被记了好，参军来的战士说：“人家解放来的都记了好，咱们自愿来的反而落了后，一定得挂劲赶上去。”
    记好的人数常常在百分之七十以上。记了好谁都羡慕高兴，但是没有眼红忌妒。因为任何人都不须眼红忌妒，记好的标准远不如当英雄模范的条件那样高，任何人都有充分的机会。部队西进时，领导上提出节省民力，减少大车。有一个刘德胜脚上打了八个泡，仍然坚决不坐大车；但是还有个张良行，只打了两个小泡，却坚决要坐大车。门板报表扬了刘德胜，旁边有一幅漫画，瘦驴拉着破车，一个战士躺在那上面，神气活现的说：“我喜欢坐大车。”张良行本来脸皮很厚，这一下却红起来了。第二天就没有再坐。门板报立即提出名字表扬他，他以后一直没有再坐车。这个单位完全取消了大车。连管理员都惊讶起来，他写了篇稿，题目就叫“门板报顶了大车”。
    有一个营统计门板报与记好学好运动改造的落后分子，一共是四十八个，其中还有二十一个成了积极分子。另一个营直属队在门板报与记好学好运动中培养了九十六个发展党员的对象。
    门板报与记好学好运动提高了中间分子，使积极分子的带头作用大大增强，而对领导有极大的帮助。卫生处的饭堂纪律不大好，很多稿子都是批评这一现象，其中有一篇说：“首长已经宣布上饭堂纪律，为什么还不遵守呢？我也没有别的办法，只有门板报上来发言。”第二天这个同志又写了一篇题目叫“今天还没有改”。而且指出姓名来了，以后饭堂纪律变得很好。落后分子对上级批评满不在乎，一到门板报批评就注意起来，因为他觉得上级对他也许有成见，大家的眼光是正确的。许多首长管理员等军事行政干部，体会到门板报与记好学好运动对自己工作的帮助，竟成了门板报热心负责的编辑了。
    通讯员郭山参加革命已七年了，因为调皮蹩扭，不爱学习，不求进步。最近他也转变了，有一次他感激地说：“门板报、门板报，你早来几年我早当了干部了。”
