　　Wuxiang's Liberated Peasants Enthusiastically and Voluntarily Transport Military Grain

　　[This newspaper Wuxiang news] During the sixth district's voluntary transportation this time, under the slogan of "general mobilization, everyone contributes," over 1,300 civilian laborers and over 200 livestock were organized to participate. They completed the task of transporting 92,000 jin of grain in one go, saving over 500 civilian labor force, totaling over 3,500 workdays. The main reasons for the rapid completion of this voluntary transportation were the leading role of cadres and the promotion of mass-based merit-earning campaigns. District Chief Shi Renshu, District Secretary Zhang Fugui, and other four comrades took the lead in personally carrying grain, which spurred all village cadres in the district to personally carry grain, thus creating a mass upsurge of voluntarily registering to carry more grain. Because carrying more grain could offset more labor, various shops and cooperatives joined this movement. Secondly, in combining voluntary transportation with production, a large number of semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers, such as women and children, were organized, and they were unified with male laborers for labor point calculation, promoting the role of auxiliary labor. For example, Hao Cuiying, the women's association secretary of a certain village, organized 60 women to weed 30 mu of seedlings in one day, completing the weeding of all the large crops in three days. Furthermore, from the beginning, a medical team was organized to accompany the voluntary transportation team to take care of the civilian laborers who fell ill on the road.

　　[Further news] In Linzhang Village, Wuxiang's fourth district, the liberated peasants voluntarily transported grain. Bao Quansuo said: "My family only had two mu of land in the past, and life was impossible. This time, I was liberated and have more than ten mu of land, and I have food and clothing. If we don't defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we won't be able to keep the fruits of our liberation. I am willing to carry 80 jin myself." Many people volunteered to carry 80 jin and 70 jin, and as a result, the entire village exceeded the task by 800 jin.

　　武乡翻身农民热烈义运军粮
    【本报武乡讯】六区这次义运，在全体大动员，大家都立功的口号下，组织了一千三百余民夫，二百余头牲口参加，一次完成了九万二千斤运粮任务，还节省民力五百余人，计省工三千五百余天。这次义运迅速完成的主要原因是干部带头，并发扬群众性的立功运动。区长史仁树、区秘书张富贵等四同志亲自带头，推动了全区村干部都亲自担粮，因此掀起了群众性的自动报名多担粮食的热潮。由于多担粮食能多顶勤工，各商号合作社都卷入了这一运动。其次是在义运和生产结合上，组织了大批半劳力和辅助劳力，如妇女儿童等，和男劳力统一折分计工，发扬了辅助劳力作用。如某村妇救秘书郝翠英，组织了六十个妇女，一天锄苗三十亩，三天即将全部大庄稼锄完。再次是由于一开始就组织了医疗队，随义运队，照顾民夫在路上生病。
