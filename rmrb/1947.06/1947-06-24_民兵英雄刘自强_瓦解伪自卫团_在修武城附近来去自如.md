　　Militia Hero Liu Ziqiang

    Disintegrating the Puppet Self-Defense Corps
    Coming and Going Freely Near Xiuwu City

    [Our newspaper, Xiuwu News] Comrade Liu Ziqiang, a top-class anti-enemy hero in Taihang, dedicated himself to building merit for the people of Xiuwu after returning from a mass meeting. Barely recovered from his illness, he led a small armed force to the forefront of the struggle to engage in elusive battles with the enemy, and frequently carried out political offensives, publicizing our policies and supporting the masses in their struggle against landlords. Because of their strict discipline, amiable treatment of people, and active protection of the masses' interests, the masses loved them dearly. In the arduous guerrilla warfare with the enemy, Comrade Ziqiang was bravely wounded, and the enemy took the opportunity to spread rumors that "Liu Ziqiang is dead." The masses wept when they heard this. However, less than a month later, his wounds healed, and he stepped forward again to the front lines, comforting the masses and reuniting with his familiar comrades. In his hometown, only five miles from the enemy's stronghold (and only eight miles from Xiuwu City), he resumed a tenacious struggle with the enemy, and the masses once again heard news of our victory.

    With patience and flexibility, using a combination of strikes and persuasion, he disintegrated the puppet self-defense corps members of his own village and Helie Jiangying, totaling more than thirty people. At the beginning of his activities, he was dissuaded by backward elements in the village, who feared provoking disaster. Comrade Ziqiang patiently explained to them, while continuing his active efforts. After a long period of struggle, the masses of the whole village established a strong and invincible fighting spirit.

    The puppet self-defense corps at the front line has been disintegrated, and Comrade Ziqiang continues to lead his comrades in free and easy activities. He was elected as a People's Hero at the county's cadre expansion meeting. On the land ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek puppets, a model banner for the struggle against the enemy has been re-established. (Yin Yu)

　　民兵英雄刘自强
    瓦解伪自卫团
    在修武城附近来去自如
    【本报修武讯】太行头等杀敌英雄刘自强同志，从群众会回来就一心为修武人民建树功勋，病体刚愈即带领小型武装挺进斗争的最前沿与敌人展开神出鬼没的战斗，并经常开展政治攻势，宣传我们的政策，为群众反倒算撑腰作主。由于他们的纪律严明，待人和霭，且能积极卫护群众利益，故群众对他们亲切的热爱着。在与敌人艰苦的游击战争中，自强同志英勇负伤，敌人便乘隙造谣说：“刘自强死了”。群众听了痛泣落泪。但未及一月，伤口痊愈，便又挺身前沿，安慰群众，和他熟悉的健儿重新欢聚一起。在距敌据点五里（距修武城亦仅八里）的自己家乡，复又与敌人展开了坚韧的斗争，群众又重新听到了我们的胜利消息。
    他以耐心的灵活的方式，用打击与争取和配合，瓦解了他本村的和烈江营的伪自卫团团员共三十多人。他的活动开初还受到了村中落后群众劝阻，怕惹下大祸。自强同志便向其耐心解释，一方面仍积极活动。经过长期斗争后，全村群众树立了坚强的不可战胜的斗志。
    前沿的伪自卫团被瓦解了，自强同志带领他的健儿仍在来去自如的活动着。全县扩干会议他被推为人民功臣。被蒋伪蹂躏后的大地上，又重新树立起了对敌斗争的模范的旗帜。（尹羽）
