　　The Enemy Fantasizes About "Eating Ready-Made"
    Grain Protection Struggle Cannot Be Relaxed
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The enemy in Anyang city has no food to eat and is on the verge of starvation, so they are desperately rushing out to various villages to seize grain. On the 13th, the enemy, with approximately two battalions, went to Zhidou Village and seized more than 8,000 jin of wheat, and to Bali Village, they seized more than 6,000 jin of wheat. "A dog will jump over a wall when cornered, and a starving man will steal food." When the enemy is on the verge of starvation, they will come out and seize our grain on a large scale. We must urgently arm ourselves and resolutely fight against the enemy, bury the grain, or transfer it to relatives and friends in the rear, not allowing the enemy to seize even a single grain, and starve the enemy to death inside Anyang city!
    [Our Newspaper's Report] After the failure of the Bo'ai enemy and puppet regime's first meeting to plan grain grabbing, on June 1st, under the direction of the traitor Zhang Honghui, they held a second meeting to seize grain from us. The plan is to have the regular army guard the city, with all security regiments mobilized, targeting the edges of the base areas, only collecting the wheat kernels, and burning the wheat in the fields that has not been threshed. They issued a wild cry to "eat ready-made food," organizing all the fleeing landlords and local bullies, forcing civilians between the ages of fifteen and forty to form groups, and seizing grain according to geographical conditions. They are now preparing carts, livestock, etc.

　　敌人妄想“吃现成”
    保粮斗争不可松懈
    【本报讯】安阳城敌人没粮吃，眼看要饿死，就拚着死命出来到各村抢粮食。十三日敌人约两个营兵力到置度村抢去麦子八千余斤，到八里庄抢去麦子六千余斤，“狗急跳墙，饿急抢粮。”敌人到快饿死的时候，就要出来大抢我们的粮食。我们要紧急武装起来和敌人坚决作斗争，把粮食埋藏起来，或转运到后方亲戚朋友家，不让敌人抢走一粒粮食，把敌人饿死到安阳城内！
    【本报讯】博爱敌伪第一次抢麦会议计划失败后，于六月一日，在张逆鸿惠主持下，又二次召开向我抢麦会议。计划以正规军守城，保安团全部出动，地区是根据地边沿，光收麦粒，在场里未打的麦子用火烧。发出“吃现成”的狂叫，组织所有逃亡地主恶霸，强迫十五岁至四十岁的百姓，编成小组，按地理条件来抢。现正准备大车牲口等。
