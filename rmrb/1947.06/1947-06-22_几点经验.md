　　A Few Experiences
    The following experiences were gained in the defense of the summer harvest: 1. Carry out mine warfare to blockade the enemy in strongholds. Mines should also be widely laid in places where the enemy frequently or may come to harass, extending the battle to defend the wheat harvest to the edge of the enemy's stronghold, so that the battle can cover the wheat cutting without affecting the rear harvesting. For example, District One planted mines in villages near the Shangbaizuo stronghold, and Xizhangzhuang planted mines on Nan寺岭 (Nansi Ridge), where the enemy often emerged, wounding five enemies in four attacks over four days. Gaoyaohe Village created stone mines with both visible and hidden firing holes, so that even if the enemy cut the visible line, the hidden line would still detonate. Yang Juhe's militia and working team created a model of combat combining sniping with mine-pulling, killing or wounding seven enemies. These methods have inflicted great casualties on the enemy and prevented them from looting the wheat. 2. Unified leadership, combining labor and military affairs, and rear support for the front lines. Organize surprise harvesting, night-time harvesting near strongholds, and rear villages supporting front villages. For example, the militia of Zhongwei Village and Beisang Village led and protected the masses of their villages to support Xiaozhaozhuang and Maijuhe. The militia all carried carrying-poles and sickles, covering and fighting the enemy when there was a situation, and also cutting and carrying when there wasn't. 3. Launch a merit campaign among the militia and the masses. "Rather sacrifice ourselves than let the masses suffer losses." This is the merit slogan put forward by the armed militia defending the summer harvest. On the 29th of last month, when the enemy came to Xizhangzhuang to loot wheat, Yang Shidao, the director of the village's military committee, led three militiamen to persistently snipe at the edge of the village. The enemy charged to the edge of the threshing ground four times in a row, but were repelled by the militiamen. The masses returned to the village and saw that the wheat in the threshing ground was still there. They happily said, "The wheat in the threshing ground was picked up. If it weren't for the militia, we wouldn't be able to eat it." The militiaman Wu Santai and five others from Luoquanzhang held off seventy or eighty enemies, protecting the safe transfer of the masses. The masses also selected forty-one model village cadres in the defense of the wheat harvest. Female militiamen Xu Lezhen and Lian Jiying, and four others from Gaoyaohe, cut wheat all day and carried wheat to the hillside at night, taking turns on guard duty in the dark. Seventy-two-year-old Gao Xuejing and thirteen-year-old Xu Ding were both recognized for their meritorious service.

　　几点经验
    保卫夏收中取得以下几点经验：一、开展地雷战，把敌人封锁在据点里。敌人经常或可能出扰到的地方也普遍的埋地雷，把保卫麦收的战斗，开展到敌人据点边，使战斗掩护割麦，不影响后方收割。如一区把地雷埋到上白作据点附近村庄，西张庄把地雷埋到敌人常出来的南寺岭上，四天四次炸伤五个敌人。高窑河村创造石雷打成明暗两个眼，敌人割了明线暗线仍可以响。杨聚和民兵武工队，创造了冷枪结合拉雷的模范战斗，杀伤敌人七名。这些办法都给了敌人很大的杀伤，阻止了敌人抢麦活动。二、统一领导，劳武结合，后方支援前线。组织突击收割，据点边的星夜抢割，后方村支援前方村。如中围村、北桑村民兵带领掩护本村群众支援小赵庄、麦桔河。民兵都扛着扁担拿着镰，有情况就掩护着打敌人，没情况也割也担。三、开展民兵群众的立功运动。“任凭牺牲了自己，不能叫群众受到损失”。这是武装保卫夏收民兵自己提出的立功口号。上月二十九日，敌人到西张庄抢麦，该村武委会主任杨世道带领三个民兵，坚持村边打冷枪，敌人一连四次冲到场边，都被民兵打退了，群众回到村里，看看场里的麦子还在，他们高兴的说：“场里的麦子是拾的，要不是民兵来，咱可吃不上啦”。罗圈掌的民兵毋三太六个人，顶着七、八十个敌人，掩护群众安全转移。群众在保卫麦收中，也选出了四十一个模范村干部。高窑河的女民兵许乐珍、连纪英等四个人，白天割了一天，晚上往山坡上转移还扛着麦子，黑夜还轮流站岗。七十二岁的郜学经，十三岁的许定都被记了功。
