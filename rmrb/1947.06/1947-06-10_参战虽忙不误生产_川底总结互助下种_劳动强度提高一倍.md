Busy with War, Production Continues
	Chuan Di Summarizes Mutual Aid for Sowing
	Labor Intensity Doubles
[Reported by our newspaper from Pingshun] The Chuan Di village in the First District summarized their twenty days of intensive sowing work on May 28th. At the summary meeting, the masses specifically calculated the efficiency of the intense production over the past two months. The calculation showed that labor intensity had doubled compared to before. The whole village had 68 laborers (full and half combined), 19 of whom left to join the war effort, utilizing 969 workdays. Fetching water caused a loss of 1,200 workdays, digging wells used 500 workdays, and supporting the war effort required 280 workdays. Other activities such as afforestation, well digging, and pond digging used more than 150 workdays, totaling 3,077 workdays. After deducting the 7 laborers who joined the war effort and the cooperative, the whole village had 52 full and half laborers remaining. They should have had only 3,120 workdays available. Besides the above-mentioned assignments, it seemed impossible to cultivate the land. But all 620+ mu of land in the village were sown. What was the reason? After the masses investigated themselves, they found the following reasons: (1) The village completed sending over 50,000 dan of manure in the first month, which saved labor. (2) The implementation of the contract system sped up the work. For example, Guo Yu'en originally contracted for 290 labor days and 80 animal power days. After summarizing, they saved 10.6 labor days and 12 animal power days. (3) Water was fetched early in the morning and late at night, without delaying regular work. (4) Labor intensity was increased: For example, the Stone Team used to have three people pulling one drill, but this year, one person pulled one drill, saving two laborers, which was equivalent to gaining a drill. The Xiao Pang Team plowed and spread fertilizer at the same time, so the livestock could rest, and they caught up with life. Also, Li Shuicheng drove an ordinary ox and plowed 2.5 mu of land a day, which was half a mu more than usual. (5) Short-term plans were made and checked at any time. At the beginning, the masses were worried that they would not be able to sow the land. To solve this problem, on the one hand, they specifically calculated the labor force, and on the other hand, they arranged short-term life, such as first ordering the first five days to make embankments, and the last two days to hoe wheat. After summarizing the results at night, the wheat field was hoeed in only one and a half days. After summarizing, they made a plan again, so the masses' confidence was improved. (6) Clear division of labor. After the soldiers left to join the war, the cadres divided the leadership, some in charge of agriculture and some in charge of sideline occupations. The front and rear change-work committee was in charge of the change-work problem with the participants in the war. (7) The division of labor and the calculation of work are clear. Before the start of the war, the method of calculating the work during the war was set. If you eat in the public at the front, you will get eight points, and if you eat yourself, you will get twelve points; if you eat yourself in the rear, you will get ten points. After the soldiers left to join the war, they immediately calculated that each labor force should work two points for the soldiers who participated in the war every day. Because the calculations came out, everyone had a bottom line, so they all automatically looked for life. After finding out these reasons, the masses were very excited, and immediately carried out front and rear evaluations, and as a result, 28 comrades were on the merit book. After the evaluation, they immediately ordered a weeding plan, and now weeding is in full swing. (Lin Hua, Zhuo Min)

　　参战虽忙不误生产
    川底总结互助下种
    劳动强度提高一倍
    【本报平顺讯】一区川底村于五月廿八日总结了廿天的突击下种工作。在总结会上群众具体的计算了两月来紧张生产的效率，计算结果，劳动强度较前增高一倍。全村共有劳力六十八个（全半折合），参战走了十九个，用工九百六十九个。吃水误工一千二百个，打井用工五百个，抗勤用工二百八十个。其它造林、掏井、掏池用工一百五十个以上，共用工三千零七十七个。全村除参战及参加合作社之七个劳力外，尚余全半劳力五十二个。应有工仅三千一百二十个，除了上述各种派工外，几乎无法种地。但是全村六百二十余亩地没有空下一块，原因是什么呢？经群众自己访说找出以下几个原因：（一）全村五万余担粪在正月间就送完了，这样省出了工。（二）实行了包工办法，赶出了工。如郭玉恩原包工是劳力二百九十个，畜力工八十个，总结了一下节省出劳力十个零六分，畜力工十二个。（三）吃水都是起早搭黑赶晌担来的，没有误了整工。（四）提高了劳力强度：如石头组过去是三人拉一张耧，今年是一人拉一张耧，省出两个劳力，等于长出一张耧。小胖组是谁犁谁撒粪，并且是随犁随撒粪，这样牲口也休息啦，生活也赶出来了。又李水成赶了一犋很平常的牛，一天就犁了二亩半地，比平时多犁了半亩。（五）订短期计划，随时检查。开始群众都是发愁种不了地，为了解决这一思想，一方面是具体计算劳力，另外是安排短期生活，如先订出头五天作岸，后两天锄麦，黑夜总结结果，只用了一天半麦地就锄完了，总结后再订计划，这样群众信心都提高了。（六）分工明确，参战走了以后，干部们即分工领导，有的管农业，有的管副业，前后方变工委员会专管与参战的变工问题。（七）折工、计工明确，在参战未开始前，即订出参战时的折工办法，在前方吃公家顶八分，吃自己顶十二分；后方吃自己顶十分，在参战走了后马上即算出每天每个劳力应给参战人作工二分，由于计算出来各人心里有了底，就都自动的找生活。找出这些原因后，群众十分兴奋，立即进行前后方评功，结果评出二十八名同志上了功劳簿，评功后即订锄苗计划，现在锄苗正在热烈进行中。（林华、卓民）
