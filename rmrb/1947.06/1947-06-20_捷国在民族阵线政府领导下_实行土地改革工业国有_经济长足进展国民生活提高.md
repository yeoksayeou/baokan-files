Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. TASS reports: Prague recently released a special announcement outlining the achievements of the Czechoslovak National Front government over the past two years as follows: 64.4 percent of national industry has been nationalized; after land reform, 1.2 million hectares of land (each hectare is equivalent to more than 16 Chinese mu) have been distributed to farmers; 1,310 bridges have been built; and 1,238 kilometers of new and repaired roads have been constructed.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th. According to TASS: The Red Star newspaper recently published an article analyzing the economic development of Czechoslovakia, stating: The nationalization of industry and finance, and the creative work of the Czechoslovak people, have opened up broad prospects for the further development of the Czechoslovak economy and its transition towards planned economy. Despite the predictions of failure of the two-year plan by domestic and foreign enemies, the Czechoslovak people are gradually and victoriously completing the plan, in order to create a national economy completely free from foreign investment and external influence. The Slovak agricultural region is now rapidly industrializing, and Czechoslovak products are gaining a reputation in the international market. The economic ties between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, Poland, France, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Brazil and other countries are growing. Economic development has led to a significant improvement in the material well-being of the people, and the government has allocated 650 million crowns as a special fund to reduce consumer prices. The Red Star newspaper pointed out: For a country that was sacrificed by the "appeasers" of Munich to be plundered by German fascists, these achievements are not easy. However, reactionary elements hidden in right-wing parties, especially the Slovak Democratic Party, are opposing the two-year plan, social reforms, and the concept of friendship between Czechs and Slovaks with lies and slander. The Red Star newspaper concluded: All attempts to prevent the cooperation of democratic forces and the creativity of the Czechoslovak people are bound to fail.

　　捷国在民族阵线政府领导下
    实行土地改革工业国有
    经济长足进展国民生活提高
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社讯：布拉格顷公布特别公告，说明捷克斯拉夫民族阵线政府两年来的功绩如下：全国工业已有百分之六十四点四收归国有，土地改革后已有一百二十万海克脱（每海克脱合十六华亩多）土地分配给农民，建造桥梁一三一○座，新筑及修补公路一二三八公里。
    【新华社陕北十七日电】据塔斯社讯：红星报顷著文分析捷克斯拉夫经济的发展，略称：工业及金融业的国有和捷国人民创造性的工作，已为捷国经济的进一步发展及其走向计划性的转变开辟了广大前途。尽管国内外敌人预言两年计划的失败，但捷国人民正逐步胜利地完成计划，以创造完全摆脱外国投资及外来影响的国民经济，斯洛伐克农业区现正飞速的工业化，捷国产品在国际市场上正获得声誉。捷国和苏、波、法、比、英、荷、瑞典、巴西等国的经济联系日益增长着。经济发展已促成国民物质福利的显著改进，政府拨出六十五万万克罗纳作为特别基金，以减低消费品价格。红星报指出：对于一个曾被慕尼黑的“和事佬”们所牺牲以供德国法西斯搂掠的国家来说，这些成就是很不容易的。但是，隐藏在右翼政党尤其是斯洛伐克民主党里的反动分子，却以谎言与诽谤，反对两年计划、社会改革及捷克与斯洛伐克间友爱的观念。红星报结论称：想阻止民主力量的合作和捷国人民创造力的一切图谋都一定是要失败的。
