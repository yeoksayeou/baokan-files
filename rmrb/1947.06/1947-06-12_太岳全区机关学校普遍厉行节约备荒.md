　　Taiyue Whole Area Organs and Schools Universally Practice Thrift and Prepare for Famine
    The District Party Committee Organs Take the Lead
    More than 10,000 Jin of Surplus Wheat Handed Over to the Public
    [Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch on the 10th] All organs in Taiyue universally practice thrift and prepare for famine. The District Party Committee organs took the lead, handing over all of the more than 12,000 jin of surplus wheat from the organs to the public on May 31st. The Public Security Sub-bureau decided that each cadre should plant five pumpkin seedlings for consumption in case of famine. The Jiyuan Cadre Training Class has saved 2,000 jin of rice and wheat and more than 70,000 yuan in local currency, handing it over to the public. In Yangcheng Second District, 18 district cadres voluntarily saved 280 jin of rice in 13 days, sending it to Dongshan Village to relieve the masses who suffered from floods last year. In the First District, 21 teachers and principals from various schools have voluntarily saved four liang of millet per person per day since June, half handed over to the public and half for famine preparation, and each person has gathered 210 jin of wild vegetables. Since the end of last month, teachers and boarding students at the Huilong Elementary School in the Fourth District have saved four liang of rice and gathered ten jin of wild vegetables per person per day. Currently, the Taiyue Administrative Office has issued a decision on thrift, calling on cadres to earnestly educate the masses to cherish the fruits of the struggle. It is strictly forbidden to export grain. Governments at all levels must earnestly implement the budget and accounting systems. The production of consumables is restricted. Finally, it calls for carrying out a meritorious service movement for thrift. Organs and individuals with achievements and creativity will be rewarded, those who are extravagant and wasteful and do not engage in production will be criticized, and those who are illegally corrupt will be severely punished.
    [Our Newspaper Jinan Dispatch on the 10th] Farmers in various parts of Jinan are reducing their living standards. On May 28th, the masses in Wenzhuang, Qiu County, held a meeting. Village Chief Feng said: "This year, I will thresh a few bags of wheat and exchange them for coarse grains to eat. I will ask my children to go to the fields to dig up wild vegetables every day. I will never smoke or drink alcohol again. I guarantee to plant one mu of melon and cowpea within two days. If it doesn't rain after the wheat harvest, I will dig earth wells and plant six mu of corn, and take time to leach salt." The production committee called on everyone to guarantee planting 50 gourds before the wheat harvest. All 250 people in the village, young and old, must be mobilized to leach salt, scraping salt soil twice a month, scraping 200 leaches each time. One month can leach 2,800 jin of salt, which can yield a net profit of 1.1 million yuan. The family of Liu Wenqing, an anti-Japanese family member in Xiangtang Street, Chengguan District, Nangong, has formulated a production and thrift plan: 1. Mix some vegetables in the rice, saving two liang per day. Use flint and tinder instead of matches. Change from smoking paper cigarettes to smoking dry tobacco. Children do not eat snacks. Eliminate the use of soap and towels. In total, save 42,200 yuan throughout the year, which can be used to buy grain to eat for five months and four days. 2. Sell the distributed floating assets for 30,000 yuan, and borrow 25,000 yuan from the bank, and organize a production group with Yin Dazhu, Wei Changhe, etc., with a total share capital of 100,000 yuan. Engage in small business at fairs, and usually raise chickens and collect manure.
