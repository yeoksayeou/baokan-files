　　Ping Shun Second District Cadres Determined to Eliminate Waste
　　[Report from this newspaper in Ping Shun] On June 14th, the Second District held a meeting of key village cadres to review preparations for drought relief through thrift. A total of 107 people attended. In addition to earnestly reviewing the "waiting for rain" mentality again, they also strictly examined instances of waste. During the review, it was pointed out that: Zongshang Village believes that having a child is a joyous event, and the feasts are too wasteful! For example, when Ma Xiaoqi's wife from Zongshang had her one-month celebration in May, she hired a cook and held a grand banquet, with over a hundred cadres, masses, and relatives attending. The cigarettes alone cost over a hundred large packs. According to incomplete statistics, it cost over 30,000 yuan, which could buy more than five *shi* of grain. Wang Guize from Dongpo farmed two *mu* and three *fen* of good land by himself, harvesting more than four *shi* of grain, but his wine pot was always at his mouth, and he also smoked cigarettes. Now his family has no grain to eat. The district government, in addition to strictly criticizing these wasteful phenomena, also called on cadres to vigorously eliminate waste, stating that reforming a wasteful family is a meritorious deed. The cadres are very determined and resolved to lead the masses to implement thrift, with each village guaranteeing that no one will starve to death.

　　平顺二区干部决心消灭浪费
    【本报平顺讯】二区于六月十四日，召开各村主要干部会，检查节约备荒，到会共一百零七人，除认真再次检查等雨思想外，并严格检讨了浪费现象，检讨中提出：综上村认为生小孩是喜事，请客太浪费！如综上马小起妻，于五月间做满月时，请来厨子大排筵宴，赴宴干部，群众亲戚达百余人，光纸烟吃够百余大包，据不完全统计共花洋三万余元，能买粮食五石余。东坡王贵则一人种二亩三分好地，收粮四石余，每天酒壶不离嘴，还吸纸烟、现在家里已没粮食吃。区政府对这些浪费现象，除做严格批评外，并号召干部，以大力来消灭浪费现象，改造一个浪费家庭就算立一功。干部决心很大，决心领导群众贯彻节约，村村提出保证不饿死人。
