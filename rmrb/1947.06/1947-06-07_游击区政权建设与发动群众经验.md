Experience in Building Political Power and Mobilizing the Masses in Guerrilla Areas

　　The Taihang Fourth Commissioner's Office issued a circular on May 12, commending Comrade Li Jiacheng, the district chief of Qinyang Chengguan District, and awarding him a major merit. The following is an introduction to District Chief Li Jiacheng's experience in establishing political power and mobilizing the masses in guerrilla areas for your reference:
　　(1) Boldly Engage the Enemy and Resolve to Persist.
　　After the Penyao battle in early November last year, Qinyang Chengguan District was restored, and Li Jiacheng was appointed district chief and captain of the armed work team, operating in the Qiliqiao Guancaotun area. At first, the masses were afraid of the enemy and dared not approach us. We could only enter at night. Later, we gradually changed to daytime activities and progressed from individual propaganda to meetings. There were three families in Guancaotun who were targets of struggle. When the enemy came, the whole family, including children and wives, took sticks and forced the masses to return the fruits of struggle. The district government then went to Guancaotun, arrested these three families, confiscated their property, and announced their crimes, stating that anyone who wanted to retaliate or collude with the enemy would be punished and their property confiscated. Because the ringleaders of the retaliation were arrested, the enemy lost their eyes and ears, and small groups did not dare to come out. I immediately restored the political power in the Qiliqiao and Guancaotun areas. But the masses saw us coming and going, unable to settle down, wanting to rely on us but not daring to, and not daring to reveal their true thoughts. The district government then lived in Qiliqiao, ten miles away from the enemy's stronghold, and moved further forward, publicizing our army's victories and our policy of helping the masses to emancipate themselves unchanged, individually targeting the enemy's actions, exposing the enemy's deceptive propaganda, and the masses believed in us more, making our political power more consolidated.
　　(2) Combine with the Thoughts of the Masses and Raise the Consciousness of the Masses.
　　The people's grain and property were all at home. In order to watch their things, the people were reluctant to leave their homes when the enemy came. When asked to empty the houses, they were afraid that their things would be lost outside, and they were afraid of exposing their possessions. In response to the concerns of the masses, it was proposed that in order to prevent the enemy from robbing things, everything should be moved outside to be buried or hidden, and everyone should find their own place, so that others would not see it, lest it be lost. When the masses heard me say this, they felt that the district chief had planned everything carefully, and they quickly emptied their houses. It was necessary for each village to stand guard and sentry, but the masses were afraid of being exposed and of being ravaged by the enemy, so the sentry posts could not be established. Later, combined with the anti-conscription and anti-robbery efforts, the villages were mobilized to set up hidden lookout posts to watch the wind and listen to the movements, so that young people could hide in case of trouble. In this way, the villages quickly set up sentry posts. The establishment of village political power was from secret to public, from partial restoration to complete restoration. The process was from a natural village or a neighborhood, from a few people's relations to collective relations. Initially, when electing village chiefs and neighborhood chiefs, the masses were unwilling to say, "Everyone does things, why bother looking for this household name!" So District Chief Li combined with the masses to discuss and proposed discipline, everyone guaranteed that no one would be exposed. Through the guarantee of discipline, everyone secretly elected the village chief by vote.
　　(3) Hold a Gun in One Hand and Distribute Land in the Other, and Vigorously Mobilize the Masses.
　　In early March, the armed work team dispersed a squad and formed two groups to mobilize the masses in eastern and western Qinyang and Zhang Shizi. Initially, the masses' enthusiasm for struggle was not high. Some said to struggle after taking Qinyang City, and some said that the targets were not at home and could not be caught, and they would still bite them in the future. In short, they felt that it was too close to the enemy and were afraid to struggle. So, the method of calculating the big accounts was used to solve it: "Since the enemy came to Qinyang for half a year, how many times has the enemy come to our village? Twelve months in a year, they can't come every month, and they can't come every day for thirty days in a month. Even if the enemy comes, they don't dare to stay. If they come often, we transfer, and if they come less, we drive them away." After such a calculation, the thought of fearing the enemy was broken. But the masses were afraid that we were unreliable and would still leave. Comrade Li Jiacheng then proposed: The district government will not leave Qiliqiao, and the work team will not leave the work village. When the masses saw us staying, their enthusiasm increased, and the activists took an oath, expressing their determination to help the masses to emancipate themselves to the end. Then, a joint struggle meeting of 1,400 people from five villages was held, and 38 targets of struggle were detained. Seven large ones were liquidated on the spot, and 31 were left to each village for liquidation. In this way, the flames of struggle were ignited. Li Jiacheng said: The armed work team combines with the militia to operate in front, the self-defense team keeps watch at the village, and the village holds anti-retaliation and fruit distribution meetings, no problem!

### 游击区政权建设与发动群众经验

　　游击区政权建设与发动群众经验
    太行四专员于五月十二日，通令表扬沁阳城关区区长李嘉诚同志，并记大功一次。现将李嘉诚区长建立游击区政权与发动群众经验介绍如下，以供参考：
    （一）大胆接敌，决心坚持。
    去年十一月初，盆窑战斗后，恢复了沁阳城关区，李嘉诚任区长兼武工队队长，向七里桥官草屯一带活动。开始群众害怕敌人，不敢接近我们。我们只能黑夜进去。以后逐渐改为白天活动，并由个别宣传进而开会。官草屯有三家斗争对象，在敌人来了之后，全家孩子老婆拿着棍子，迫着群众退斗争果实。区公所便到官草屯把这三家人逮捕了，东西没收了，并公布他的罪状，说明谁要倒算，谁和敌人通气，便要惩办谁，没收谁。由于倒算祸首被逮捕，敌人丧失了耳目，小股不敢出来了，我随即恢复了七里桥、官草屯一带的政权。但群众看我来来往往，住不下来，想依靠不敢依靠，不敢露真实思想。区公所即住在离敌据点十里的七里桥，并更向前活动，宣传我军胜利，宣传我帮助群众翻身政策不变，个别针对敌人的行动，揭穿敌人的欺骗宣传，群众更相信我，使我们的政权更加巩固起来。
    （二）结合群众思想，提高群众觉悟。
    老百姓的粮食财物都在家，为了看东西，敌人来时，老百姓舍不得离家，叫他们空室清野，他们一怕放在外面东西丢了，二怕暴露了家当。针对群众的顾虑，提出为防范敌人抢东西，都要把东西搬在外边埋起来，或者藏起来，各自寻找自己的地方，不要叫别人看见，免得丢了。群众听到我这样讲，觉得区长给他们计划周到，很快空室清野了。要各村站岗放哨，但群众怕暴露怕遭敌人的摧残，岗哨建立不起来，以后结合反抓丁，反抢劫，动员各村站隐蔽的了望哨，看风声，听动静，有事情年轻人好躲藏，这样各村便很快安设了岗哨。建立村政权，是由秘密到公开，由局部的恢复到全部的恢复，过程是由一个自然村或一个闾，由少数群众关系到集体关系。初选村长闾长，群众不愿意说：“有事大家干，何必找应这个户名！”这样李区长结合群众讨论，提出纪律，大家保证，谁也不能暴露。经由纪律的保证，大家用票秘密选了村长。
    （三）一手拿枪一手分田，大力发动群众。
    三月初，武工队分散了一个班，成立两个组到东西沁阳、张十字发动群众，最初群众斗争情绪不高，有的说打下沁阳城再斗，有的说对象不在家，捉不住的，将来还要叫着咬着。总之，嫌离敌人近，害怕不敢斗。于是用算大账的办法加以解决：“自敌人来沁阳半年来，敌人来过咱村几回？一年十二个月，也不能月月来，一月三十天他不能天天来，即使敌人来，他不敢住下来，来的多，我们转移了，来的少我们打跑他。”经过这样一计算，打破了畏惧敌人的思想。但群众又怕我们靠不住，还要走。李嘉诚同志随即提出：区公所不离开七里桥，工作组不离开工作村。群众看到我们住下来，情绪高了，积极分子宣了誓，表示干的决心，区干部宣誓保证帮助群众翻身到底。接着便开了五个村联合的一千四百人斗争会，扣了三十八个斗争对象，当场清算了七个大的，留三十一个归各村清算。这样燃起了斗争的火焰。李嘉诚说：武工队结合民兵前边活动，自卫队村边放哨，村里召开反倒算、分配果实大会，没事儿！
