　　Boldly Unleash and Resolutely Support
    Fujiang New District Accuses and Distributes Land
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 6th Dispatch] The land reform in the Fourth District of Jiang County (newly liberated) is progressing rapidly by implementing the policy of bold action. Six key villages in the district, including Yangcun, Xu Luyu, Daqun, Xia Bai, and Dajiao (including thirty-one natural villages), are nearing completion. This area had long been occupied by Chen Ziwen, a traitor and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agent, (Chen was killed on June 22nd last year when our army liberated Jiang County,) and the feudal forces were extremely strong. When Chiang and Hu invaded Jiang County again last August, the landlord Yao Fenyuan organized a counter-reckoning team under the protection of Chiang's army, seizing back 200 acres of land that the peasants had been allocated in Dongheshui. This time, after the liberation of Jiang County, the democratic government first supported the peasants, executing the counter-reckoning ringleader Yao Fenyuan. With the assistance of our democratic government, peasants who had fled returned to their hometowns one after another, reclaiming the land that had been taken back by the landlords. At the same time, forces were organized to suppress bandits and special agents. Subsequently, under the leadership of the Land Reform Committee, land distribution was implemented. With the strong support of the democratic government, the movement gained great momentum, and the land distribution struggles in villages from Xuluyu in the east to Dajiao in the west were in full swing.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 9th Dispatch] Thirty-five villages in the new district of Fushan have ignited the raging fire of accusing Chiang and Yan's troops of their crimes. On May 11th, fifty members of the Turn-Over Team of the First District arrived in six key villages, including Zhongcun, Gecun, Liangcun, and Xizuo. Initially, due to the cruel slaughter and plunder by Chiang and Yan's troops, the general public had a strong sense of change, fearing trouble and retaliation from the enemy. After the comrades of the Turn-Over Team carried out in-depth mobilization, discovered activists, and colluded with the masses, they gradually began to accuse Chiang and Yan's troops of their crimes. According to statistics from five key villages, peasants from thirty-five villages are now boldly accusing them, and are deeply digging into the roots of suffering and finding the source of misfortune. Among them, twenty villages are brewing land distribution struggles. In the accusations, the sufferers are unconsciously linking with other sufferers, the poor are linking with other poor, and the women are linking with other women, forming a torrent that washes away their blood feuds. In Gecun, nine peasants were captured by Chiang's troops, four were buried alive, and bamboo sticks were nailed into the fingers of five. When their families recounted these inhumane atrocities, they aroused the vengeful anger of the entire village. When Duan Yulian, a woman from Zhongcun, accused the landlord Chen Lilin of forcing her husband to death, she immediately demanded the return of this life debt. Wang Yuhua, a woman from Matai Village, accused the landlord of selling her, causing her to suffer inhuman pain, saying, "Tears cannot express resentment; we must rise up and fight!" Thus, the masses' accusations against Chiang and Yan's troops progressed to accusations against landlords and despots, and the accusations developed into struggle actions.
    [Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 7th Dispatch] The land reform in the border area of Xiangling is advancing by leaps and bounds, approaching the near suburbs of Linfen and the Tongpu railway line. After completing the land reform in fourteen villages in the first phase, the county began to advance towards the near suburbs of Linfen on May 12th. During this period, due to the great victory in southern Shanxi, the enemy was terrified and retreated. At the same time, the county's militia formed four combat groups, actively cooperating with the land distribution struggle and taking the initiative to attack, greatly boosting morale. Thirty-three villages, including ××, fifteen miles from the city of Linfen, quickly launched the land distribution struggle. By the 22nd, it had been preliminarily and successfully concluded in ten days, and efforts are now being concentrated on distributing the fruits.

　　大胆放手坚决撑腰
    浮绛新区诉苦分田
    【本报太岳六日电】绛县四区（新解放）土地改革贯彻大胆放手进展神速，全区杨村、续鲁峪、大群、下柏、大交等六个基点村（包括三十一个自然村）已接近完成。该区长期为汉奸兼蒋特陈子文所盘据，（陈逆于去年六月二十二日在我军解放绛县时被击毙，）封建势力极强，去年八月蒋胡再侵陷绛县时，地主姚奋元即在蒋军卵翼下组织倒算队，在东贺水将农民清算回的土地二百余亩夺去。此次绛县解放，民主政府首先为农民撑腰，处决了倒算头子姚奋元，逃亡在外的农民在我民主政府协助下纷纷返乡，将地主倒走的土地收回，同时组织力量扑灭匪特，继则在土地改革委员会领导下实行分田，农民在民主政府的有力支持下，运动声势浩大，东起继鲁峪西至大交等村分田斗争轰轰烈烈。
    【本报太岳九日电】浮山新区三十五村已掀起控诉蒋阎军罪行的烈火。一区翻身大队五十人于五月十一日分别到达中村、葛村、梁村、西佐等六个基点村。最初，一般人民因受蒋阎军残酷屠杀掠夺，存在着浓厚的变天思想，怕惹事非，怕敌报复。经翻身队同志深入动员，发现积极分子，串通群众，逐渐都控诉起蒋阎军的罪行来。目前据五个基点村统计已有三十五个村的农民大胆的进行诉苦，并且深入挖苦根与找祸根，其中有二十个村正酝让分田斗争。在诉苦中无形中苦人联苦人，穷人联穷人，妇女联妇女的汇成一条山洪，冲洗着自己的血恨。葛村曾有九个农民被蒋军抓去，四个填了坑，五个指中被钉竹签。其家属吐诉这些惨无人道的暴行时，激起了全村群众复仇怒火。中村妇女段玉莲在控诉地主陈立林逼死其男人时，立刻要讨还这笔人命债。马台村妇女王玉华控告地主出卖她，使她遭受非人痛苦时，说：“泪水申不了怨恨，非起来干不行！”以是群众控诉蒋阎军进到控诉地主、恶霸，由诉苦发展到斗争行动。
    【本报太岳七日电】襄陵边地土地改革大踏步前进，逼近临汾近郊及同蒲沿线。该县于第一期完成十四个村子的土地改革后，五月十二日又开始向临汾近郊挺进。此时期内，由于晋南大捷，敌人恐惧退缩，同时全县民兵组成四个作战集团，积极配合分田斗争，主动出击，大大振奋了人心。距临汾城十五里的××等三十三村迅速展开分田斗争。至二十二日，十天中已初步胜利结束，现正集中力量分配果实。
