　　Building Fortifications
    Chiang-Controlled Area Ballad
    Zhang Yaoshan
  　Yu Li
    Old and young alike, heads bowed low,
    Building fortifications is endless woe.
    Merchants have no money for trade,
    Capital and interest lost, doors barricaded.
    The people's lives are even harder to bear,
    Secret agents extort at their whim and care,
    Tall buildings turn to piles of brick,
    Building his mother's bastard's nest, quick, quick, quick!

　　修工事
    蒋区歌谣
    张耀山
  　于力
    老少一齐低着脖，
    修筑工事是长活。
    商人无钱做买卖，
    本利齐光把门锁。
    百姓生活更难过，
    特务随便来勒索，
    高楼大厦变砖堆，
    修他妈的王八窝。
