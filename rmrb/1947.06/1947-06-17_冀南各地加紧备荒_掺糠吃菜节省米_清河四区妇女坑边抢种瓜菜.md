[This newspaper Jinnan fifteenth cable] Masses of Wang Shuangmiao in Qinghe Second District are saving and preparing for famine. Everyone unanimously decided: 1. No smoking or drinking in the whole village; 2. No eating of good things; 3. No wasting money; 4. Immediately mix bran and vegetables into meals. The whole village has already started acting according to these four points. After the mobilization meeting for village cadres to conserve in Qiu County First District, Nanliu Village immediately held a mass conservation meeting and launched a challenge, with the conditions being no smoking, no drinking, no eating refined flour buns, and no spending of spare money. Women stipulated to spin for one half-day and pick vegetables for one half-day, ensuring no scattering of flour, economizing at the stove, and not lighting lamps when spinning at night. Lao Hei's family in Bailiuzhai responded to the call for conservation. The family of three used to eat five jin of grain every day, but now they eat one and a half jin less per day, and they also stopped using oil. Qin Qingping, a family of two in Dongrizhai, used the flour that used to make seven refined flour buns to steam fourteen bran and vegetable buns. In Xiaosi, children and women go to pick tree leaves every afternoon. At the mass meeting in Nanzhuang Village, Zhendang Third District, the Women's Association first put forward its own conservation plan: first, no smoking or drinking; second, no buying of any foreign thread, silk, hemp fabrics, or cosmetics; third, no eating at restaurants when going to market, and if they can't return at noon, they will bring dry food from home. And they challenged the Farmers' Association with these conditions. The members of the Farmers' Association responded loudly and agreed to each other's discipline. Violators will be announced on the public blackboard. Then groups challenged groups and individuals challenged individuals. The Qiu Shushuang group proposed that this summer, each member of our group will wear at most one set of single clothes. The Qiu Shuan group said: "Our group will not buy dyed cloth when buying clothes." Qiu Renge, the head of the Women's Group, said: "Our group members usually don't eat sesame oil." Member Xing Sanwen said: "My family saves three taels of rice every day." Dai Huanyong said: "I will definitely no longer burn paper or incense, and no longer gamble. If I violate this, I am willing to be punished." The atmosphere at the meeting was very tense, and now the members of the Rural Women's Association have all entered into action.
    [This newspaper Jinnan fifteenth cable] To overcome parasitic consciousness and respond to increased production for famine preparation, women in various parts of Jinnan actively reclaimed wasteland and rushed to plant. Women in Qinghe District launched a campaign to plant melons and vegetables on the edges of pits and along rivers. In Ergeying, under the leadership of Hong Baixiu and Wei Xicui, the director and deputy director of the Women's Association, more than 70 people voluntarily joined together and planted one mu of cowpeas in one afternoon, and assigned a group to reclaim more than one mu of land by the pit on the west side of the village. Ninety-eight women in Shaozhuang participated in vegetable planting, divided into four large groups and twenty-four small groups. From weeding, turning the soil, leveling the ridges, digging pits, carrying water, watering the pits to planting, they did everything themselves, and planted more than 100 ridges of melons and vegetables in two half-days. Zhang Xiulan and her sister-in-law Wang Yumei, women from Chengjiao Village, Qiu County Fourth District, pulled a seed drill to plant three mu of sorghum and watered two mu of peanuts and planted one mu of melon during the recent planting upsurge. Mingchun, a woman from Suzhou Village in Guangping, watched over two children. Under the call of rushing to plant, she used a pot to fetch water and planted three mu of seedlings herself. An old lady in Zhengkou Town, Gucheng, who was over forty years old, ran a restaurant at home. She and her man took care of the business, and squeezed out time to reclaim half a mu of wasteland in a day with her ten-year-old girl. All the young and middle-aged people in Louzi East Street, Zaoqiang Fourth District, went to control the river, so they mobilized the old people, women, and children to rush to plant 798 mu in five days.
