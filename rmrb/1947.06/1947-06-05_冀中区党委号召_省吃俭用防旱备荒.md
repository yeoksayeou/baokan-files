　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 2nd. The Jizhong District Party Committee recently issued an emergency call to prevent drought and prepare for famine, stating in brief: All levels of leadership organs and Party members in various regions must currently take organizing farmers to overcome the drought as the current priority task. Any views and practices of paralysis, indifference, or laxity are manifestations of a lack of mass perspective. Exhaust all possible methods to organize diverse forms of drought prevention mutual aid, such as digging wells, repairing wells, temporarily digging earthen wells, and carrying water for planting, etc. Organize the opening of canals for irrigation to strive to avoid leaving an acre of land uncultivated. All organs and troops should do everything possible to help the local masses overcome the drought and famine. A vigorous campaign to save and prepare for famine should be launched, starting with organs and troops, leading towns, villages, and peasant households to lower their living standards and carefully plan their consumption. Mobilize the masses to collect wild vegetables and tree leaves to prevent lean years. Make saving and preparing for famine a trend, create a mass movement, and at the same time vigorously develop sideline production, especially the textile industry.

　　冀中区党委号召
    省吃俭用防旱备荒
    【新华社晋察冀二日电】冀中区党委顷发出防旱备荒紧急号召。略称：各级领导机关和各地党员，目前必须把组织农民战胜旱灾作为当前的突击任务。任何麻弊、漠视、松懈的观点与作法，都是缺乏群众观点的表现。想尽一切可能的方法，组织多种多样的防旱互助，如打井、修井、临时挖土井、挑水点种等，组织开渠浇地，争取做到不荒一亩土地。各机关部队更应尽一切力量，帮助驻地群众克服旱荒。应热烈展开节约备荒，从机关部队做起，带动一个城镇乡村农户降低生活水平，精心计划吃用。发动群众采集野菜树叶，以防歉年。把节约备荒造成一种风气，造成一个群众运动，同时大力开展副业生产，特别是纺织业。
