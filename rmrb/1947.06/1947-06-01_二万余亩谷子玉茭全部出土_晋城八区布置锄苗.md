More Than 20,000 Mu of Millet and Corn All Sprouted
Jincheng Eighth District Deploys Weeding and Thinning

[Reported from Jincheng by this newspaper] The Eighth District convened an expanded cadre meeting of over 400 people on May 12th. In addition to mobilizing the development of production and a campaign to establish merit, it also summarized and inspected, launched a concentrated sowing effort, and deployed a concentrated weeding and thinning effort. Under the call to fully support the front lines and develop the great production movement, the district started spring plowing early, grasped it tightly, and organized the concentrated effort quickly. The entire district has 17,532 mu of millet land, 11,714 mu of corn land, 1,875 mu of cotton land, and 295 mu of hemp land, and completed plowing, harrowing, cultivating, and fertilizing in half a month, and sowing in seven days. The Fifth District has applied fertilizer at an average of 20 dan per mu, and Shiwowo Village has reached an average of 40 dan per mu. The main reasons for achieving these results are: (1) Universal organization. A total of 3,753 households in the district participated in mutual aid teams, accounting for 94% of the total number of households, with a population of 6,812 people, accounting for 52.3%, including 2,897 full male laborers, accounting for 97%, 1,573 semi-laborers, accounting for 95.4%, 1,381 full female laborers, accounting for 49.3%, and 961 semi-laborers, accounting for 58%. There are 750 head of livestock, accounting for 72%. A total of 526 mutual aid teams were organized, 163 of which can provide regular mutual assistance, 164 of which have implemented work points for equal value exchange, 21 of which have achieved a combination of agriculture and sideline occupations, 23 of which have achieved a combination of agriculture and supporting the army, and 20 of which have achieved a combination of agriculture, sideline occupations, and supporting the army (three-way mutual aid). Among them, Zhanglukou is more universal in its mutual aid organization, and is better at mobilizing and organizing semi-laborers. Out of 183 households in the whole village, 172 households participated in mutual aid teams, accounting for 94%, and out of a population of 519, 466 participated in mutual aid, accounting for 84.8%; 93.5% of full female laborers have participated in mutual aid teams, and out of 63 head of livestock, 57 have participated in mutual aid teams, accounting for 90%. Thirty mutual aid teams have been organized, all of which have achieved the implementation of work points for equal value exchange, and nine have achieved a combination of agriculture, sideline occupations, and supporting the army. (2) Absorbing women, children, and military personnel, cadres, families of martyrs, and veterans to participate in labor. For example, the Tian Heyun team in Beipo Village has created new experiences in absorbing military personnel, cadres, families of martyrs, veterans, and the lonely and widowed to participate in mutual assistance, which has promoted the development of mutual aid production in the whole district, and has produced 20 model mutual aid teams such as Tian Heyun; five model veterans such as Tan Xiangui, Liu Defeng, and Niu Xueshan; twelve model military personnel, cadres, and families of martyrs such as Zhang Liuye (female), Jin Xiaochang (female), Zhou Yufeng (female), Zhao Shiwu, Dong Qiyuan, and Zhao Shuibao; and seven model women and children such as Zhou Chunfeng and Qian Qifa. In the deployment of the concentrated weeding and thinning, each village inspected the emergence of seedlings, and everyone said with joy: "Starting early this year, there is enough soil, except for some deficiencies in the cotton seedlings, the millet seedlings are full." Finally, they accurately calculated how many people could be organized to weed, and decided that the entire district would complete the concentrated weeding and thinning within half a month from May 20th, and put forward slogans such as "Mobilize women, children, and semi-laborers to participate in weeding, weed for military personnel, cadres, families of martyrs, and veterans first, ensure that not a single mu of seedlings is left unweeded, no one is left idle, and fertilize at the same time as weeding the millet."

　　二万余亩谷子玉茭全部出土
    晋城八区布置锄苗
    【本报晋城讯】八区于五月十二日召开全区四百余人的扩干会议，除动员开展生产、立功运动外，并总结检查，突击下种，布置突击锄苗。该区在全力支援前线和开展大生产运动的号召下，春耕动手早，抓的紧，组织突击的快，全区谷地一万七千五百卅二亩，玉茭地一万一千七百十四亩，棉花一千八百七十五亩，麻地二百九十五亩，在半个月内完成了犁、耙、耕地、上粪，七天内完成了下种。五区上粪已达到每亩平均廿担，石窝村达到了每亩平均四十担。获得这些成绩的主要原因是：（一）普遍的组织起来。全区参加互助组的，计共三千七百五十三户，占总户数的百分之九十四，人口六千八百十二人，占百分之五十二点三，包括男全劳力二千八百九十七人，占百分之九十七，半劳力一千五百七十三个，占百分之九十五点四，女全劳力一千三百八十一个，占百分之四十九点三，半劳力九百六十一个，占百分之五十八。牲口七百五十头，占百分之七十二。共组织互助组五百二十六个，能作到经常互助的一百六十三组，实行了工票作到等价交换的一百六十四组，作到农副业结合的二十一组，作到农业与支差结合的二十三组，作到农副业与支差结合（三合互助）的二十组。其中张路口在互助组织上较普遍，发动组织半劳力上较好，全村一百八十三户，参加互助组的一百七十二户，占百分之九十四，人口五百一十九口，参加互助四百六十六口，占百分之八十四点八；女全劳力的百分之九十三点五已参加了互助组，牲口六十三头，参加互助组五十七头，占百分之九十，组织了三十个互助组，都已作到了实行工票等价交换，作到农副业、支差结合的有九组。（二）吸收妇女、儿童及军、干、烈属、荣军参加劳动。如北坡田合运组，在吸收军、干、烈属、荣退军人、孤寡参加互助上创造了新的经验，推动了全区互助生产的发展，涌现出田合运等廿个模范互助组；谭先贵、刘德凤、牛雪山等五个模范荣退军人，张柳叶（女）、靳小长（女）、周玉凤（女）、赵仕五、董其元、赵水保等十二个模范军、干、烈属；周春凤、钱其法等七个模范妇女，儿童。在布置突击锄苗中，各村检查了小苗出土情况，大家喜盈盈的说：“今年动手早，有垧土，除棉花苗有些欠缺外，谷苗等都是满苗”。最后精确计算能组织多少人锄苗，订出从五月二十日起，半个月内全区完成突击锄苗，并提出“发动妇女、儿童半劳力参加锄苗，先给军、干、烈属、荣退军人锄，保证不荒一亩苗，不闲一个人，谷锄寸顶上粪”等口号。（义风）
