　　[This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan 15th dispatch] After the enemy occupied Wenshang, the cadres in the Fifth District of Jibei were separated from the area for half a month, but they immediately returned to persist. They first convened village meetings in Liangzhuang and Baizhuang to report the victory news, announce the ten regulations, resolutely suppress those who sabotaged land reform and organized aid to the enemy, and commend those who implemented government decrees, scouted enemy situations, and sent intelligence. At the same time, they swore in front of the masses: "The district will not leave the district, and we will definitely fight guerrillas, carry out land reform, and investigate secret agents with everyone." On the spot, they distributed 1,390 catties of grain hidden by the landlord during the day to the masses, and led the masses to distribute land. The first shot was fired, and the masses were excited. The peasants in other villages asked the cadres to go to their villages as soon as possible to arrange the distribution of land and grain. The cadres responded to the peasants' requests, and the government announced the confiscation of all the property of Jia Baotu, the landlord and secret agent of Shilizha, and Liu Ruilan, the puppet captain, and handed it over to the masses. The district cadres and district team led the peasants to distribute land during the day and encircled and suppressed bandits and special agents at night. They eliminated Du Wencheng's bandit gang in Shilizha, which further reduced the masses' concerns. In ten days, the situation in the entire district was opened up, the masses were mobilized, and guerrilla groups were established demanding "protecting grain, protecting land, and protecting lives." With the masses as their support, the cadres were more confident in persisting in guerrilla warfare. According to incomplete statistics, in ten days, twenty villages had recovered 15,000 mu of land from landlords, with an average of two mu per person, more than 10,000 catties of grain, and many trees and houses.
    [This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan 15th dispatch] Our guerrilla base in Fucheng County persists in the rear enemy position and carries out land reform, which has now entered the review stage. At the beginning, the county leadership fully supported the masses, gathered the landlords and puppet families together, implemented registration, and organized joint guarantees for property protection. Let the landlords and puppet families bow their heads to the masses and swear at the peasants' congress, guaranteeing that they will implement government decrees in the future. At the peasants' congress, the cadres also took an oath, expressing their determination to live and die with the masses. The cadres also personally led the masses to distribute land and property. Comrade Sun Bengu of the Fourth District personally executed the bad guys who abused and killed peasants when the Kuomintang troops occupied the area. When his wife was sick and his family came to call him, he replied without hesitation: "I am too busy with work to leave." From the beginning of the movement, the county emphasized that middle and poor peasants were one family, and middle peasants participated in the struggle and the organization. The masses began to realize their own strength and carried out joint struggles and village struggles, and universally distributed land and floating wealth. On May 17th, the county held another 100,000-person peasant congress. Each district reviewed that this land reform was not thorough enough. Gaoqiao in the Eighth District, which was considered a relatively good village, found that only superficial things of the landlords had been dealt with. Valuable clothes and grain were buried. Some landlords' houses were not dealt with, land was not measured, and contracts were not exchanged. Therefore, the masses proposed a thorough investigation of land and property.

　　济北五区游击战中
    十天分田万五千亩
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】济北五区干部在敌人侵占汶上后，有半月时间脱离地区，旋即返回坚持。先在梁庄、白庄召开村民大会，报告胜利消息，宣布十条规约，对破坏土地改革及组织资敌者坚决镇压，对执行政府法令侦察敌情送情报者予以表扬。同时在群众面前宣誓：“区不离区，一定和大家一起打游击、捣土改、查特务”。当场把地主白天藏的一千三百九十斤粮食分给群众，带领群众分地。第一炮打响了，群众兴奋了，其他村的农民纷纷要求干部赶紧到他们村布置分地分粮，干部答复了农民的要求，将十里闸地主兼特务贾包图、伪队长刘瑞兰的全部财产由政府宣布没收交给群众，区干部和区队白天领着农民分地，夜里围剿匪特，在十里闸消灭了杜文成股匪，更减少了群众的顾虑。十天内打开了全区的局面，群众动起来，要求“保粮、保地、保生命”成立起游击小组。群众有了依靠，干部坚持游击战，更加有了信心。据不完全统计，十天中二十个村已向地主要回土地一万五千亩，平均每人分到二亩，粮食万余斤及树木房子等甚多。
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】我游击根据地复程县，坚持敌后阵地，开展土地改革，现已进入复查。开始县领导上充分给群众撑腰，把地主伪属集中起来，实行登记，组织连环保与财产保。让地主伪属在农民大会上向群众低头宣誓，保证今后执行政府法令，在农民大会上，干部也进行宣誓，表示决心与群众共生死，干部并亲自带领群众分田分财，四区孙本固同志，在蒋军占领时亲手处决虐杀农民的坏蛋。他老婆病了，家人来叫他，他毫不犹豫的回答：工作忙离不开。该县从运动开始即强调中贫农是一家，中农都参加了斗争，参加了组织。群众开始认识了自己的力量，进行联合斗争和分村斗争，普遍分得了土地与浮财。五月十七日，全县又分别召开十万人的农民大会，各区都检讨出这次土地改革尚不彻底。八区高桥平日认为是比较好的村子，检查结果只是搞了地主的表面的东西，贵重的衣物粮食都被埋藏起来了。还有些地主的房子未处理，土地没丈量，文约没换，因此群众提出彻底查田查财。
