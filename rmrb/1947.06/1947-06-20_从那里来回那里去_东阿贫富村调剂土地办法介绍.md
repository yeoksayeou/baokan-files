　　From Where It Came, Back to Where It Goes
    An Introduction to Dong'e's Method of Adjusting Land Between Poor and Rich Villages
    In the land reform of the North Small District of the Fifth District of Dong'e, most of the land has already been distributed. However, the land problem has not been completely resolved because there are fewer landlords and more poor peasants in the poor villages. In the rich villages, the landlords were not thoroughly struggled against, and people stopped when they were asked to fill an average of more than two mu of land. As a result, the poor villages felt that there was no point, and the rich villages were lenient to the landlords. This time, during the review, the district cadres, based on this situation, used the slogan "Poor people all over the world are one family" and "Villages help villages, neighbors help neighbors" to call on the rich villages to help the poor villages by giving land. First, they found Zhuangke Village (a rich village) and asked the masses to discuss it. The masses demanded that after filling an average of three and a half mu per person, they would give the remaining land to the small villages. They said, "We can only give to others when we have enough to plant," but behind their backs, some people were discussing, "If we struggle too much, we still have to give it to other villages, so it's better to leave more for the landlords." The district cadres felt that this method would not work. After research, the district cadres believed that the problem had not been solved from the perspective of the masses' thinking, and it was necessary to investigate the root cause of this idea. So they held another joint meeting of village cadres. At the meeting, someone suggested: The land should be returned to its original home. Let's discuss where the landlords' land came from in the first place? Many people admitted that much of the landlords' land came from exploiting other villages. The landlords' long-term workers, short-term workers, tenants, debtors, and land sellers were all from other villages. The village cadre of Shuipo Village, the richest village in the entire district, also said: "The reasoning is very correct. Take our village as an example. The landlord used more than 30 hired laborers to cultivate the land, but our village only has four or five people. Most of the loans are also given to other villages, and land is bought near other villages." In the end, the village cadres all said that they understood, but they were afraid that the masses would not understand. They should also ask the masses to calculate this way. They decided to hold mass meetings in each village after returning to the village to calculate whether the landlords in their village had exploited other villages, and what exploitation the poor people in their village had suffered from the landlords in other villages. After the masses in the rich villages understood the reasoning, they felt that it would be wrong not to do so, and even if the struggle against the landlords was not thorough, they should still give a share to other villages. So they struggled with more enthusiasm. In less than ten days, each village universally reviewed the situation and cleared out all the landlords' land. During this period, each village counted how many households had an average of less than two mu of land per person, and how much land they had in total. When the district held another joint meeting of village cadres, it was estimated that each village could generally fill an average of two mu, so the rich villages were asked to calculate how much land they had left after filling two mu. The poor villages calculated how much land they were short after filling two mu. After each village calculated the surplus and the shortage, and after everyone calculated based on the quality of the land, the economic strength of the village, and the number of dependents of workers and martyrs, the amount of land owned by each village was increased or decreased. In this way, it was determined which village would take out how much surplus land, and which village would need how much land. Later, it was studied which village would allocate to which village, and the two villages would set a date to recognize the land boundaries, sign land transfer agreements, and handle all necessary procedures. As a result of the adjustment, eight of the twenty villages in the entire district took out land, and thirteen villages received land, totaling 770 mu of land adjusted. Each village generally filled an average of two mu, with the least filling an average of one mu and seven fen, and the most filling an average of two mu and four fen. The poor and rich masses were very satisfied. (Xiang Yang)

　　从那里来回那里去
    东阿贫富村调剂土地办法介绍
    东阿五区北小区在土地改革中，大部土地已经分配过了，但穷村地主少贫农多，土地问题没有得到彻底解决，而富村地主斗的不彻底，每人填平到二亩多地就不干了。结果是穷村觉得没有搞头，富村对地主宽大。这次复查，小区干部根据这种情况，用“天下穷人是一家”、“乡帮乡、邻帮邻”的口号，号召富村帮穷村送地，首先找到庄科村（富村），让群众讨论，群众要求每人填平三亩半后，再把剩余的土地送给小村。他们说：“俺够种的才能给人家呀”，背后就有人议论：“咱斗争多了还得给外村，还不如给地主多留点哩”。小区干部感到这个办法行不通。经过研究后，区干认为还是由于没有从群众的思想问题上求得解决，必须追究群众这一思想的根源。于是又召开了一次村干联席会。会上有人提出：土地要还老家，咱讨论一下，地主的土地到底从那里来的？许多人都承认地主的土地很多是从外村剥削来的，地主的长工、短工、佃户、债户、卖地户等许许多多都是外村里的。全小区最富的村子——水坡村的村干也说：“道理很对，就像俺庄吧，地主用到过三十多个雇工种地的，俺村人才不过四、五个，放账也多半放到外庄，买地买到外庄村跟前。”最后村干都说自己确实是通了，就怕群众不通，应该叫群众也这样算算账，决定回村后各村都开群众会，算算本村的地主剥削外村没有？本村的穷人受到外村地主的那些剥削？富村群众弄通了道理，觉得不这样办不对，斗的地主不彻底也得分给外村一份。于是斗的上劲了，不到十天，各村普遍的复查了一遍，将地主的土地都清查出来。这一时期中各村都统计了每人平均二亩地以下的户有多少，共有多少地？小区又召开村干联席会时，约计各村普遍能填平到二亩，就让富村计算填平二亩还余多少地。穷村计算填平二亩还缺多少地。各村计算出余数和缺数之后，又经大家算账，按地质好坏，村里富力大小，车工烈属多少三个条件决定，将各村所有土地数目予以增加或减少，这样就确定那个村究竟拿出多少多余的土地，那个村要多少土地。以后就研究那个村拨给那个村，两个村自定日期去认地边，交地约，办理一切必要手续。调剂结果，全小区二十村中有八个村拿出土地，十三个村得到土地，共调剂土地七百七十亩，各村一般填平到二亩，个别最少的填平到一亩七分，最多的填平到二亩四分，穷富群众都很满意。（向阳）
