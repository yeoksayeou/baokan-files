　　Mixing Bran and Storing Vegetables, Implementing Planting
    The Residents of Dameng Village Are All Preparing for Famine
    Immediately Take Action to Lead the Fight Against Drought and Prepare for Famine
    [This newspaper, Neiqiu News] Bai Chunbao, a turned-over hero from the Second District, led the masses of Dameng Village to turn themselves over, and is now leading the masses of the village to urgently fight drought and prepare for famine, and has formulated a long-term plan for fighting drought and preparing for famine. The village began mobilizing for drought resistance and famine preparation on the 20th of last month. First, they recalled their experience of surviving famine. Woman Yu Yufeng said: "That year (1943), we had nothing to eat, so we sold our children to others, and we still can't get them back. If the year hadn't been so bad and we hadn't prepared in advance, who would have been willing to sell their children to others?" Everyone also said: "When you mention the famine years, tears will fall from your eyes and your heart will also be filled with tears. If you don't prepare for famine, you will starve to death!" Everyone unanimously proposed ways to prepare for famine early. Finally, it was decided to establish bran-mixing groups, with two alleys as a group, to supervise and inspect each other. Everyone made a plan to prepare for famine by eating bran, picking wild vegetables, and planting more vegetables. Each person would pick and store 60 kilograms of wild vegetables (dried), plant 10 melon plants, and 10 eggplant plants. The 40 *shi* of bran stored in the village would not be touched. In addition to the bran stored by the mutual aid teams (earned from milling rice) and the sesame oil dregs and flower seeds from the village's oil mill and flower house, they would not be sold unless it rained, and they could be eaten for another two months. From now on, they would start eating wild vegetables mixed with bran. In the past, each person ate an average of 7 *he* of grain per day, but now they would save 2 *he*, eating 5 *he* per day, which would save another two months' worth of grain in five months. The savings, planting vegetables, and picking wild vegetables combined would be enough to eat for another half year to survive the famine. At present, the whole village has entered a high tide of famine preparation. Children and old people are going to the outskirts of the village in groups to pick elm leaves, locust leaves, sour willow leaves, *Salsoala collina*, and *Allium mongolicum*, etc. In addition to eating them, they are drying them and storing them. Women have taken the initiative to lower their living standards and changed their meals. According to statistics, out of 158 households in the village, 96 households have stored 1,074 kilograms of dried wild vegetables. Li Jintang, Li Laohu, and others have each stored more than 30 kilograms. All 158 households in the village have changed their meals, and 62 households have started eating bran. Although it is the busy farming season, they are still eating a ratio of "three *sheng* of sorghum and one *sheng* of bran." The only two households in the village that are not eating bran and picking wild vegetables are those with sick family members. A few days ago, the village bought another 16 *jin* of melon seeds and distributed them to each household. The planting of melons has now exceeded the plan of planting an average of 10 melon plants per person. Another active action to prepare for famine is to continue organizing point planting. Of the 48 *qing* of land in the village, 1,460 *mu* are wheat fields, 700 *mu* are rapeseed fields, and 569 *mu* are cotton fields have been point planted. The eleven usable wells have been point planted around the surrounding land. It is planned to build another ten wells. After the wheat harvest, the stubble land will be left and 500 *mu* of sorghum and corn will be point planted. If it does not rain again, sweet potatoes, radishes, and turnips will be point planted until the end. In the current stage before the wheat harvest, they are focusing on watering flowers. The second is to organize sideline income to exchange for grain to prepare for famine. Men are milling rice and transporting goods, and women are stepping up weaving. For example, the 15 laborers in Li Wenxiang's mutual aid team earned more than 70,000 *yang* in six markets, not counting the bran they earned. According to the market price at the time, it was enough to buy 12 bags of rice, enough for the whole team to eat for more than half a month. After completing the 100-day weaving task, the women are still not resting and are continuing to step up weaving. At present, from cadres to the masses in the whole village, there is no negative waiting or pessimistic phenomenon. Men, women, and children are all involved in the high tide of famine preparation.

　　掺糠积菜贯彻点种
    大孟村民人人备荒
    立即动手领导抗旱备荒
    【本报内邱讯】二区翻身英雄白春保，领导大孟村群众翻了身，现又领导该村群众紧急抗旱备荒，订出了长期的抗旱备荒计划。该村由上月二十日开始，即进行抗旱备荒动员，首先进行了渡荒经过的回忆。妇女虞玉凤说：“那年（四三年），俺没吃的，把孩子卖给人家，到现在还弄不回来，要不是年景坏，事先没准备，谁肯把孩子卖给了人家呢”，大家也都纷纷说：“提起过荒年，眼里不掉泪心里也得掉泪，不备荒还得饿死哩！”大家一致提出了早些备荒的办法，最后通过成立掺糠组，两个巷子为一组，大家互相督促、互相检查。大家订出吃糠采积野菜多种菜的备荒计划，每人采积野菜（干）六十斤，种上十棵瓜，种上十棵茄子，村中存的四十石糠不动了，再加上各互助组存的糠，（碾米赚的）及村中油房的香油渣、花房的花籽，天不下雨就不往外卖了，还可吃两个月。从现在起，开始吃野菜掺糠，过去每天每人平均七合粮食，现在节约二合，每天五合，有五个月又可省出两个月的粮食来。节约及种菜采野菜等合在一起，足可多吃半年渡过灾荒。目前全村已进入备荒的热潮，儿童老头成群结队到村郊野外，去楼榆叶、槐叶、酸柳叶、采沙沙蓬、芽芽葱等，除吃外，把他晒干，积存起来，妇女们已主动地降低了生活水平，换了饭食，据统计全村一五八户，已有九十六户积下干野菜一千零七十四斤。李金堂、李老虎等，每人已积下三十斤以上。全村一五八户都换了饭食，已有六二户开始吃起糠来，虽然在农忙时节，仍是吃的“三升高粱一升糠”的比例，全村还没有吃糠采野菜的两户，都是有病人家。前些日子村里又买了十六斤瓜子，分发各户，现种瓜已超过每人平均种上十棵瓜的计划。另一备荒的积极行动，继续组织点种，全村四十八顷地，麦地一千四百六十亩，油菜地七百亩，点种棉花五百六十九亩；能使的十一眼井，周围地都点种完了，计划再修十眼井。麦收后，誊下茬地了再点种五百亩高粱、玉茭，如再不下雨，再点种红薯、萝卜、蔓菁，一直点种到底。在麦收前的现阶段，正突击浇花。其次是组织副业收入，换来粮食备荒，男子碾米运输，妇女加紧纺织，如李文祥互助组十五个劳力碾米运输，六个集即赚洋七万多，赚的糠还不算，按当时市价，能粜十二布袋谷子，够全组吃半月多。妇女在完成百日纺织任务后，仍不歇工，继续加紧纺织。现全村从干部到群众，毫无消极等待悲观等现象，男女老幼均卷入备荒热潮。（子琦）
