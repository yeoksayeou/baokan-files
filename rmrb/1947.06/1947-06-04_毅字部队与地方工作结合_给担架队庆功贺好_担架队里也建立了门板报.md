[This dispatch from the Yubei Front by our correspondent Wu Xiang on the 30th] The People's Liberation Army's Yi Character Troops celebrated and commended the Neihuang Model Stretcher Team and the five stretcher heroes and seventy-four stretcher models from Nanle and Qingfeng. This is a new development in the troops' "finding good, recording good, learning good" movement and a concrete manifestation of the integration of troop work and local work. Under the influence and help of the war service department of the unit, the stretcher teams of Neihuang, Nanle, Qingfeng and other counties established bulletin boards to carry out activities such as "finding good, recording good, learning good," greatly boosting their morale. More than 400 stretchers were deployed with no desertions. Some carried continuously more than 20 times without needing to be replaced, and some automatically went to the front line to rescue the wounded, unafraid even when they themselves were injured. The troops then decided to celebrate and commend them. On the evening of the 18th, led by heroes wearing big red flowers, the stretcher teams marched into the meeting place, plastered with commendation notices, beating gongs and drums. Nanle stretcher heroes Zhang Le, Zhao Zuo, Neihuang's Liu Qinglong, Geng Zilai, and various models, walked into the hero and model seats amidst warm applause. The chairman reported on the heroic deeds, and the stage played triumphant and lively music. The comrades of the troops and various stretcher teams successively offered wine, dishes, and flags to the heroes and models. The hero delivered a reply saying, "Participating in the war to fight Chiang Kai-shek is our own business. The comrades at the front are so brave, and they are all good people. Of course, the people cannot let the wounded comrades suffer." At this time, the atmosphere in the audience was extremely excited, and they unanimously shouted: "With the joint efforts of the army and the people, completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries!" Liu Deyou quietly said to the person next to him: "Such a small thing I did was also recorded as good. Next time, I have to really do a good job!" The 11 stretcher team members who just arrived said: "You have recorded good deeds and made contributions, wait and see what we do next time." Then the curtain opened, and the troop's combat drama troupe performed the opera "The Army and the People are One Family."
