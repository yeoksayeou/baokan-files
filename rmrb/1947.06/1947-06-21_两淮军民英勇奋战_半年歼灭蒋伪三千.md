Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 19th. In the Lianghuai (Huaiyin, Huaian) area, the heart of northern Jiangsu, where Bai Chongxi personally came to deploy the suppression campaign last winter, the army and people have fought bravely for the past six months, completely crushing the Chiang army's so-called "pacification zone experiment plan," annihilating more than 3,300 Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops, seizing 10 machine guns, and more than 470 rifles and horses. The democratic regime in the entire Huaiyin area, which had shrunk to a single township of sixteen square miles last autumn, has now been restored to more than nine hundred square miles and twenty-one townships, and controls more than fifty miles of the Liutang River running through the county and more than ten miles of the Gu (Zhai) Qian (Ji) Highway. Machang and other important towns in eastern Huaian and the vast rural areas are still under the rule of the democratic regime. The Chiang regime is in the city and township, and its orders do not go beyond ten miles. Since the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to withdraw from Lianghuai, the local armed forces have always insisted on fighting in the same place. Last autumn, the Chiang army stationed three reorganized divisions in Huaiyin, but the people's local armed forces still hid out during the day and came out at night, constantly attacking the enemy. This spring, the Chiang army even designated the county as an "experimental county" and implemented the "pacification experiment plan," repeatedly "encircling and suppressing" with a battalion or more of the Chiang army for a total of more than 30 times. With the concerted efforts of the army and the people, the enemy's "experiment plan" was bankrupted, and the liberated area was able to expand day by day. The Chiang army in Huaian launched two large-scale "encirclements and suppressions" in December last year and March this year. During the second "encirclement and suppression," the Chiang army openly stated: "I would rather kill a thousand by mistake than let one go." The army and people in the area organized struggles against running away from conscription, resisting donations, resisting taxes, and opposing the overturning of fields, and broke into the enemy's heart, sweeping away small strongholds and disrupting the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" deployment. In the battle on the north bank of the Gan River, four platoons of the Chiang army's Fourth Division were completely wiped out. In mid-April, Machang was recovered three times, and the enemy's second "encirclement and suppression" was once again defeated.

　　两淮军民英勇奋战
    半年歼灭蒋伪三千
    【新华社华中十九日电】处于苏北心脏，去冬白崇禧亲莅部署进剿之两淮（淮阴、淮安）地区，半年来军民英勇奋战，完全粉碎蒋军所谓“绥靖区实验计划”，歼蒋伪三千三百余名，缴机枪十挺，步马枪四百七十余支，淮阴全境民主政权，去秋曾缩至十六方里一个乡地区，目前已恢复至九百余方里二十一个乡，并控制横贯县境之六塘河五十余里与古（寨）钱（集）公路十余里。淮安东部马厂等重镇及广大农村，目下仍在民主政权统治下，蒋政权局处城厢，政令不出十里。自解放军主动撤出两淮后，当地地方武装始终坚持原地斗争。去秋蒋军曾以三个整编师的兵力驻屯淮阴，但人民地方武装仍昼隐夜出，不断袭敌，今春蒋军更将该县划为“实验县”，推行“绥靖实验计划”，以一个营以上蒋军反复“清剿”合计达三十余次。在军民一致奋战下，卒使敌“实验计划”破产，解放区得以日益扩展。淮安蒋军于去年十二月及今年三月曾进行两次大规模的“清剿”。第二次“清剿”时，蒋军公开提出：“宁愿错杀一千，不愿放走一个”。该地军民组织了跑反、抗捐、抗税、反倒田的斗争，并突入敌心脏，扫除小据点，打乱敌“清剿”部署。淦河北岸一战，蒋军整四师四个排完全覆灭。四月中并三度收复马厂，敌二次“清剿”至此又告粉碎。
