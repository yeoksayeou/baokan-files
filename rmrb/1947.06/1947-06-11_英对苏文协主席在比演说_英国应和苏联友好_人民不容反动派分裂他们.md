Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: TASS, Brussels reports: The Chairman of the British-Soviet Cultural Association, Mr. Pritt, delivered a speech here, expounding on the importance of British-Soviet relations for universal peace. Attendees included representatives from Belgian intellectual circles, diplomatic personnel, and Belgian senators. Pritt stated: Maintaining world peace depends on the relationship between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The Soviet people and government need peace and friendly relations with Britain, the US, and other countries. There is no anti-American or anti-British sentiment within the Soviet Union. In response to the Labour Party pamphlet "Cards on the Table," which falsely accused Soviet newspapers and publications of attacking the British government for the past ten years, Pritt said that he had carefully reviewed a month's worth of all Soviet newspapers and could not find anything besides faithful criticism. Regardless of the strong anti-Soviet movement by some people within Britain, the British people sympathize with the Soviet Union. The slanders against the Soviet Union and its leaders published in publications are preventing the establishment of an atmosphere conducive to the establishment of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the West and permanent peace. British and even more American reactionaries are responsible for this. The "European Federation" movement, advocated by Churchill, only demonstrates a new conspiracy to organize an anti-Soviet bloc. He concluded by saying: These two nations (Britain and the Soviet Union), among the strongest in the world, will not allow reactionaries to divide them.

　　英对苏文协主席在比演说
    英国应和苏联友好
    人民不容反动派分裂他们
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社布鲁塞尔讯：英对苏文化协会主席蒲里德在此间发表演说，阐述英苏关系对于普遍和平之重要性。与会者为比国知识界代表、外交界人员及比国参议员。蒲里德称：维持全世界和平端赖美英与苏之关系。苏联人民及政府需要和平及与英美同其他各国间的友好关系，在苏联内并无反美或反英的情绪。在答复工党小册子“放在桌上的牌”诬告苏联报纸及出版物十年来都在攻击英国政府时，蒲里德说，他仔细的查看了一个月全苏联报纸，除了忠实的批评外，找不出什么东西。不管英国内某些人强烈的反苏运动，英国人民是同情苏联的。出版物所刊载的反苏联及其领袖的诽谤阻止着建立一种气氛以引向苏联与西方友好关系的建立与永久的和平。英国同甚至更多的美国反动派们要对此负责。在邱吉尔鼓吹下的“欧洲联邦”运动，仅只表现出组织反苏集团的新的阴谋。他结束时称：世界最坚强民族中的这两个民族（英国和苏联），将不容反动派分裂他们。
