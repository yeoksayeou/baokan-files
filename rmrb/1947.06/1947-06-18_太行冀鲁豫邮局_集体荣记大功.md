	Taihang Jilu豫 Post Office
	Collectively Awarded a Great Meritorious Service
	[This newspaper reports] Taihang postal work is striving to improve the speed and security of mail delivery. Taihang Xinhua Daily and this newspaper have sent letters to the Border Region Postal Service Bureau to commend them.
	It briefly states: Taihang postal work has achieved great results in May and June. Taking newspaper distribution as an example, in the past it took three days to go to Zuoquan, but now it only takes two days; Changzhi used to take three and a half days, but now it takes one and a half days; on other branch and township postal lines, such as Yushe to Qi and Tai, it has been advanced by one day. Each bureau dispatches newspapers as soon as they arrive; Changzhi, Huguan and other counties have changed from an every-other-day system from the county to the districts to a daily system, speeding up by one day (without increasing manpower). Xiangyuan even runs night shifts, speeding up by two days. In addition, postal workers in various places travel hundreds of miles a day, carrying heavy loads of sixty or seventy pounds, without complaining of hardship, serving the people, and many models have emerged, such as Liang Chengyuan, a postal worker in Heshun; Hou Jinlong, a postal worker in Changzhi... After receiving the letter, the Postal Service Appraisal Committee immediately held a meeting to discuss it, and unanimously agreed that: Taihang District postal work, after the error-checking and root-tracing campaign, implemented a night shift system in early April, and designated May as "Aircraft Month." Recently, it has consolidated the night shift, improved township postal lines, and strived to change from every-other-day to daily service as much as possible with the existing staffing. It has indeed made many achievements and innovations in improving speed. The entire system has been expedited, facilitating people's communication and supporting the patriotic self-defense war. It was decided to award all employees of all levels of bureaus and stations in the district a collective grand merit.
	[Another report] At the beginning of the patriotic self-defense war in the Jilu豫 District, it took the initiative to organize military postal services, undertaking the communication and liaison between the front and rear armies. In the past half month, in the face of the enemy's blockade and division, and the large-scale advance and retreat of our army, it completed its tasks victoriously, without fearing difficulties and dangers, and created a model for military postal services, winning praise from all parties. The General Appraisal Committee also awarded the District Postal Administration and military postal workers a collective grand merit retroactively. (Qi Yan)
