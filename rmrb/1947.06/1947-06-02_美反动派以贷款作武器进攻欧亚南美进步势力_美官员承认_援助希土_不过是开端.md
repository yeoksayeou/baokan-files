　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: TASS, New York dispatch: Statements by U.S. government officials and news reports show that the U.S. government is currently strengthening the position of U.S. imperialism with large loans and credit loans to support reactionary forces and prevent the growth of progressive tendencies in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. U.S. officials admit that the "aid to Greece and Turkey" plan is only the first phase of this loan program. Associated Press reporter reports: Democratic Senator Barkley said in a speech to several business representatives in Washington that the United States cannot think that the passage of the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act means that the loan program has been completed. Secretary of Commerce Harriman also discussed the loan issue in a speech in San Francisco on May 16. Like Undersecretary of State Acheson's speech in Cleveland, he believes that the U.S. loan policy is an attempt to help the people of those countries who are willing to rebuild their lives under the principles of "free system." However, while the party government is preparing public opinion for the application of the "aid to Greece and Turkey" plan to other places, it temporarily avoids submitting the details of the plan to Congress and the people. News reports suggest that the government is trying to frequently ask Congress for small amounts of loans instead of submitting the entire plan to Congress at once, because the demand for large amounts of loans may arouse strong opposition from Congress. New York Times news: Some Democrats in the western states told Truman that non-partisan voters in the western states have widespread indifference to the "Truman Doctrine." Even "Newsweek" (Harriman is one of the shareholders of the magazine), which supports the government's policy, said: "The difficulties of the Truman Doctrine are faintly emerging." Due to the political crisis in Italy, loans to Italy have attracted special attention at present; on May 16, Italian Ambassador to the United States, Tarchiani, met with Marshall, while the head of the Italian financial delegation in the United States, Lombardo, discussed financial issues with Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs of the State Department, Thorp. The Evening Star hinted that only if the United States provides financial assistance to Italy can it "prevent" the country's economic chaos and the victory of the left wing in the next Italian election. Former Undersecretary of State Welles also wrote in the newspaper in support of the policy of lending to Italy for political purposes in order to force the country to turn to the right. Overseas News reporter reports: U.S. Embassy in Italy financial adviser Tasca was suddenly summoned back to the country on May 10, and it was not clear until two days later. It turned out that the Italian cabinet was about to fall, and Tasca's recall reflected Italy's need for U.S. loans, and the Christian Democratic leaders believed that Italy would not receive financial assistance unless Italy established a more right-wing government. Although most newspapers support the government's plan, the Chicago Sun published an editorial on May 13, sharply criticizing Acheson's speech as a blow to international cooperation and solidarity. The newspaper wrote: Acheson's speech on U.S. aid seems to be good, but you will eventually "find out that Acheson really means that we should focus on helping those countries that support us in the struggle between our views and the Soviet Union." The newspaper pointed out that the United States can best achieve the goal of world prosperity and peace only when it uses its economic power for non-political purposes to build prosperity around the world, rather than deepening the dangerous international rift facing the world.

　　美反动派以贷款作武器进攻欧亚南美进步势力
    美官员承认“援助希土”不过是开端
    【新华社陕北廿九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美政府各官员之声明与报界消息，显示美国政府刻正以大量贷款与信用贷款加强美帝国主义之地位，以支持反动力量及防止欧亚与拉丁美洲进步倾向之生长。美国官员承认“援助希土”计划仅仅是此种贷款计划的第一阶段。美联社记者报导：民主党参议员巴克莱在华盛顿向若干商界代表演说称：美国不能认为援助希土法案的通过即意味着贷款计划已经完成。商务部长哈立曼于五月十六日在旧金山演说时，也论及贷款问题。他和副国务卿亚泽逊之克利夫兰演说一样，认为美国贷款政策是企图帮助那些愿意在“自由制度”原则下重建自己生活的各国人民。但是党政府方面正为“援助希土”计划应用至其他地方准备舆论时，它却暂时避免将计划之细节提交国会与人民。报界消息暗示，政府企图时常向国会要求小量贷款而不是将整个计划一次提交国会，因为大量贷款之要求可能引起国会的强烈反对。纽约时报消息：西部诸州若干民主党人告杜鲁门称，西部诸州无党派选民对于“杜鲁门主义”存在着广泛的漠不关心。甚至支持政府政策的“新闻周刊（哈立曼为该杂志股东之一）也说：“杜鲁门主义的困难正隐隐出现。”由于意大利发生了政治危机，对意贷款在目前引起了特别注意；五月十六日意驻美大使齐亚尼与马歇尔会谈，同时意在美之财政代表团团长郎巴多与国务院专司经济事务之助理国务卿陶尔普会商财政问题。《明星晚报》暗示，只有美国在财政上对意进行援助，才能“阻止”该国经济混乱以及左翼在意大利下届选举中之胜利。前副国务卿威尔斯在报上著文，也支持为了政治目的而对意贷款之政策，以便迫使该国向右转。《海外新闻》记者报导：美驻意大使馆财政顾问台斯卞突于五月十日被召返国，两天以后事情才弄清楚了。原来意大利内阁要倒台，台斯卞之被召回，是反映意大利对美国贷款的需要，以及基督教民主党领袖们认为除非意大利建立更右翼之政府，否则意大利将得不到财政援助。虽然大多数报纸支持政府之计划，而芝加哥太阳报则于五月十三日发表社论，尖锐指责亚泽逊演说是对国际合作与团结之打击。该报写道：亚泽逊关于美国援助的演说，看起来似乎是好的，但是你终于会“发现亚泽逊实在的意思，是我们应该集中帮助那些在我们与苏联观点斗争中支持我们的国家。”该报指出美国只有将自己的经济力量使用在建设全世界各地繁荣之非政治的用途上，而不是加深现在面临世界的危险之国际裂痕时，能够最好的达到世界繁荣与和平之目标。
