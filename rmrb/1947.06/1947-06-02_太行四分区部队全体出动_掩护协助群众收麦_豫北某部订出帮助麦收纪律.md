　　[Report from Taihang] The Party, government, army, and people of the Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district have been urgently mobilized to carry out the struggle to defend the wheat harvest. All troops in the sub-district have been dispatched, pressing close to the KMT army's cities, striking at enemies who venture out to seize grain, launching anti-puppet and anti-retaliation movements, and capturing landlords who return to their villages to collect wheat. The military and civilians throughout the district have unanimously put forward the slogans: "Don't let the enemy seize a single grain of wheat!" "Starve the enemy, fight quickly! Harvest quickly! Hide quickly!" The Matun troops have taken the lead in advancing to the south of the road, and the Rentun troops, the day after the meritorious service meeting in the spring, set off for the front lines to defend the wheat harvest. In addition to deciding to take time each day to help with the wheat harvest, all sub-district organs will suspend work entirely for three days from the 29th specifically to help the masses with the wheat harvest. (Xin Dan)
    [Report from Taihang] The Taihang Fourth Administrative Office issued measures for rewarding the defense of the summer harvest on the 18th of last month. (1) All our troops and people's armed forces (militia, working teams, etc.) should unconditionally return to the masses any grain seized from them by the enemy and give them honorary rewards. (2) If public grain is robbed by the enemy and recovered by us, 25 percent will be given as a reward. (3) If the enemy's military and government organs, grain stores, and the private wheat of stubborn puppet leaders are intercepted by our armed forces, 50 percent will be rewarded, and the rest will be handed over to the government. (4) If our military and civilians discover enemy grain in the puppet villages and report it to the government, a 50 percent reward will be given; if the information is provided in advance, resulting in a capture, a 15 to 20 percent reward will be given. (5) In the border administrative regions, those who successfully complete the task of requisitioning grain during the defense of the wheat harvest will be rewarded with 1 to 3 percent of the grain collected to the meritorious armed forces and staff. The method shall be determined separately by the county. (Zhi Peng)
    [Dispatch from the Northern Henan Front, 1st] General Liu Bocheng's troops are helping the masses harvest wheat amidst intense fighting. A certain unit put forward "Five Musts, Four Must Nots, and Two Not Afraid Of" during the wheat harvest. The Five Musts are: First, help the families of military martyrs and revolutionary soldiers; second, help poor and widowed peasants; third, help landlords; fourth, propagandize; fifth, cut neatly and cleanly. The Four Must Nots are: First, do not eat the masses' food or smoke the masses' cigarettes; second, do not hinder the masses' harvesting by borrowing tools; third, do not damage the masses' tools; fourth, do not say strange things. The Two Not Afraid Of are: First, not afraid of the hot weather; second, not afraid of blisters on the hands.
