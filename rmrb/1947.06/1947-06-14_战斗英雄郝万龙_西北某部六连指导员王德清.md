　　Battle Hero Hao Wanlong
  　Wang Deqing, Political Instructor of the Sixth Company of a Certain Unit in Northwest China
    On the second day of the Panlong battle, we were moving under enemy fire. The enemy's two machine guns were desperately firing at us, and two comrades were wounded. The company commander said to Hao Wanlong: "Your second squad must resolutely break into the enemy's bunker and not get bogged down." I also said: "These two heavy machine guns are counting on you. Are you confident of taking them? Everyone is preparing to complete the plan!" He replied loudly: "I guarantee to the Party that I will definitely take them down." He then shouted to the whole squad: "Comrades, let's see who captures the machine guns first, and who completes the plan first?" After the attack began, the enemy wavered. Hao Wanlong rushed to the edge of the outer trench and saw that the enemies in the outer trench were dumbfounded. Seeing that these enemies could no longer fight, he ignored them and jumped into the outer trench, staring wide-eyed, with his bayonet pointed at the enemy and a grenade loop on his finger. He shouted to the bunker: "Surrender or die! Surrender and be treated leniently." The enemy replied, "Surrender, surrender." Hao Wanlong took the opportunity to enter the bunker, but the bunker was too high to climb. He ordered, "Pull me up." The enemy grabbed Hao's gun and pulled him up, and the enemies in the outer trench also came to help him. He went up to the bunker with only his gun. He quickly pointed the gun at a tall, thin, pale-faced man in neat clothes and asked, "What official are you?" The official quickly raised his hand and said, "No, I'm the company commander. Seventh Company, 499th Regiment. I'll do whatever you say." Hao Wanlong said, "Don't be afraid. I came to the People's Liberation Army from Ma Zhanshan's side. I became a squad leader in three months. As long as you lay down your weapons, you will be treated leniently. If your people and things are missing, just ask Hao Wanlong. Tell everyone to lay down their weapons quickly." At this time, some of our people behind had run down to the outer trench. The company commander bowed and handed his pistol to Hao Wanlong with both hands. Hao Wanlong shouted again, "Friends, surrender quickly." The enemies surrendered one after another, and soon a large pile was placed on the ground. The prisoners also gave him cigarettes, vying to call, "Squad Leader Hao, have a smoke." At this time, Sun Qianyou, a soldier in his squad, and some people from the first squad also came up.
    At this time, he saw enemy reinforcements arriving at the outer trench, so he immediately handed over the prisoners and captured weapons to Sun Qianyou, and ran straight down to the outer trench, rushing towards the enemy in a few steps. A fellow stretched out his gun to shoot him, but he dodged and grabbed the gun, shouting to surrender. The fellow refused to surrender, so he quickly pointed the pistol he had captured from the company commander at the fellow's chest and said, "What, you won't surrender?" The fellow panicked and dropped his weapon. Many enemies behind were stunned, so he shouted loudly: "Your Seventh Company has surrendered, as long as you lay down your weapons, you will be treated leniently." Immediately, the reinforcements were busy laying down a large pile of guns, and dozens of hands handed him cigarettes. These two large piles of weapons included one rocket launcher, twenty-four light and heavy machine guns and submachine guns, more than twenty rifles, two pistols, and many military supplies.
    Hao Wanlong became a combat hero in the Datong battle only three days after joining the army. He has performed meritorious service in every battle. From the Xihuachi battle to this battle, he has performed fourteen major meritorious services.

　　战斗英雄郝万龙
  　西北某部六连指导员王德清
    蟠龙战斗的第二天，我们在敌火下运动。敌人的两挺机枪拚命的打我们，两个同志挂了彩。连长对郝万龙说：“你们二班坚决打进敌人碉堡去，不能拉锯。”我也说：“这两挺重机枪靠给你了，你有把握弄过来吗？大家都准备完成计划呀！”他响亮的回答：“我向党作保证，一定拿下来。”又向全班喊着：“同志们，看谁先缴过机枪来，看谁先完成计划？”冲锋开始后，敌人动摇了。郝万龙冲到外壕边一看，外壕的敌人都吓呆了，他看这些敌人已经打不了仗，就没管他们，一踪身跑下外壕，瞪大眼睛，刺刀对准敌人，手榴弹线套在指头上，就向碉堡上喊：“缴枪不缴不行，缴枪优待。”敌人回答“缴、缴。”郝万龙乘势要进碉堡，但是碉堡太高上不去。他就命令，“吊我上去”。敌人就捉住郝的枪往上拉，外壕的敌人也来扶他，他单人独枪的就上了碉堡。很快把枪口对准一个细高个子、苍白脸、衣服很整齐的人问：“你是什么官”？那个官连忙举起手说：“不是，是连长。四九九团七连，你叫我怎样我就怎样。”郝万龙说：“不要怕，我是从马占山那边到解放军的，三个月就当了班长。只要放下武器，绝对优待。你们的人和东西少一点问我郝万龙，快叫大家放下武器。”当时我们后面的人有的跑下外壕了。那连长就鞠了个躬，双手把手枪给了郝万龙。郝万龙又喊：“朋友们，快缴枪吧。”敌人纷纷缴枪，一会儿地上放了一大堆。俘虏们又送给他纸烟。争着叫“郝班长吸烟。”这时，他班上战士孙钱友和一班也有人上来了。
    这时他看到敌人的援兵到了外壕上，便马上把俘虏和缴的枪交给孙钱友，一直跑下外壕，三两步迎上敌人。一个家伙将枪一伸要打他，他一闪把枪抓住叫缴枪。那家伙不缴，他很快把那连长缴过来的手枪对准那家伙的胸口说：“什么，你不缴？”那家伙慌忙就放下了武器。后面好多敌人看的愕了，他就大声喊：“你们七连都缴枪啦，你们只要放下武器，就优待你们。”马上，来援的敌人又忙着放下一大堆枪，又有几十只手给他递纸烟。这两大堆武器，共有火箭炮一门，轻重和手提机枪二十四挺，步枪二十多支，手枪两支，还有许多军用品。
    郝万龙入伍才三天，就在大同战斗中当了战斗英雄。每次战斗他都立了功，从西华池战斗到这次战斗，他就立了十四次大功。
