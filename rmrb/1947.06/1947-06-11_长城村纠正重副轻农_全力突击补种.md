　　Changcheng Village Corrects Emphasis on Sideline Production Over Agriculture
    Fully Commits to Emergency Replanting
    [Benbao Zuoquan News] Through participation in the war effort, all residents of Changcheng Village were organized, and after a crash planting, they assumed their task was complete. They then organized all their efforts to build a water mill, spending a total of over 800 workdays. Recently, an inspection revealed that three plots of wasteland remained, and one-third of the hemp and small beans had not been planted. In addition, there were many instances of rough cultivation. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that spring planting was far from sufficient, and it was clarified that sideline production does not equal actual income and does not increase wealth. Political Director Comrade Lian Ji said: "We keep talking about agriculture as the mainstay combined with sideline production; everyone knows that, but as we talk, we do worse, and this year's spring plowing was affected by building the water mill!" Finally, it was decided to temporarily halt the construction of the water mill and vigorously continue planting and replanting. Mutual Aid Team Leader Hao Qinghe said: "Even if the weather is dry and difficult to plow, we will use hoes to plant more seedlings than fewer. Moreover, it won't delay planting millet, oats, and buckwheat!" (Cheng Qian, Xiu De)

　　长城村纠正重副轻农
    全力突击补种
    【本报左权讯】通过参战，长城全村不漏一人的组织起来，突击下种后自以为完成任务，便组织全力修筑水磨，共计花工八百多个。最近经检查才发现尚有遗留荒地三块，三分之一的麻和小豆尚未下种，此外还有很多粗耕粗作现象。经讨论后，一致认为春耕下种还十分不够，同时又明确了副业生产不顶实际收入，增加不了财富。政治主任联吉同志说：“咱们光说农业为主结合副业生产，谁也知道，可是说的说的就做差了，今年春耕修水磨受影响啦！”最后，决定暂时停修水磨，大力继续下种和补种。互助组长郝清和说：“天旱耕不动，那怕咱们用＠刨，多种棵总比少种棵强。况且黍子莜荞麦还不误哩！”（程前、修德）
