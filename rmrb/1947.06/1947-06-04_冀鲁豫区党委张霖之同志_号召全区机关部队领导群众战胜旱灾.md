[This report from our newspaper, Jilu-Yu, dated the 2nd] Comrade Zhang Linzhi of the District Party Committee called for the urgent mobilization to prevent drought, prepare for famine, produce, and practice economy. Comrade Zhang pointed out: The current self-defense war is on the eve of a counter-offensive, and we have absolute certainty of victory in military and political terms. However, due to the prolonged drought, a drought situation has already formed, and a poor harvest is certain. Financial expenditures will increase with the development of the military situation, and overcoming financial difficulties has become the central issue in winning the war. In this situation, we must overcome difficulties to ensure victory in the war. Therefore, Comrade Zhang issued a resounding call: Fight against the drought, and everyone should show the spirit of overcoming disasters in 1942 and 1943, and the spirit of overcoming locust plagues in 1943 and 1944. As long as we do not wait, do not rely on fate, but rely on our organization and our strength, and resolutely fight against natural disasters, we will overcome difficulties. Comrade Zhang specifically instructed: All district organs and troops should take the lead in guiding the masses to carry water and plant seeds, mobilize and organize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women, organize all well water to irrigate the land, and plant one more crop to reduce one point of difficulty. One person's strength cannot plant much, but if all the strength is organized, the extent of the disaster can be reduced. In addition, in counties along the river, repairing the Yellow River embankments, and with young and middle-aged men joining the army and participating in the war, the rural labor force has been reduced unprecedentedly. Therefore, organs and troops must regard helping the masses carry water and plant seeds, distribute seedlings and weed, harvest wheat and thresh, and help rush planting when it rains during the wheat harvest as an important task of their own, and set it as one of the conditions for comrades in organs and troops to perform meritorious service for the people. Regarding the issue of preparing for famine, Comrade Zhang said: This year's wheat harvest is estimated to be 50%. We must save from the beginning. He called on everyone to save two taels of grain every day, oppose extravagance and resolutely reduce expenses (including reducing village expenses), stop all unnecessary expenses, resolutely implement streamlining troops and administrations, merge similar organs, abolish rear organs, and transfer surplus personnel to combat troops, economic departments, or to mobilize the masses; and called on everyone to contribute their private savings. Finally, Comrade Zhang called on Party members to take the lead, guide the masses in the whole district, organize to prevent drought and rush planting, and earnestly save and prepare for famine.

[This report from our newspaper, Jilu-Yu, dated the 2nd] Various counties, in conjunction with drought prevention and famine preparation, continue to launch a production and frugality campaign. The Sixth Administrative Office held a conference of cadres from various organs on the 9th of this month, calling for frugality in food and clothing. Deputy Commissioner Yang put forward the slogan "One person saves a handful of rice, the public suffers one less difficulty," and a wave of frugality immediately formed in various organs. At present, individuals have saved 33,550 catties of millet from clothing, shoes, socks, and allowances, and organs have become self-sufficient with 6,634 catties of millet, and the post office has become self-sufficient for three months. Fuping County has also launched a wave of frugality to support the front lines. All comrades in the public security station in the Fifth District have saved all the clothing, shoes, socks, and food expenses they received, and are reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables themselves; the comrades in the district office and police station donated more than 5,000 yuan in remuneration for digging trees to the front; the masses in Zhunzhuang Market in the Ninth District donated 3,540 yuan to the front; 63 poor military, worker, and martyr families in the Sixth District saved all 9,224 catties of preferential grain and sent it to the front; and villages in the northern part of the Second District automatically initiated regulations on frugality for guests coming and going to weddings and funerals, without using tobacco and alcohol.

　　冀鲁豫区党委张霖之同志
    号召全区机关部队领导群众战胜旱灾
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】区党委张霖之同志号召紧急动员防旱备荒生产节约。张同志指出：目前自卫战争正处在反攻前夜，军事、政治都有绝对胜利把握，但由于天久不雨，旱象已成，歉收已经肯定，财政开支将随军事的发展而发展，克服财经困难已经成为争取战争胜利的中心问题。在这种情况下，我们必须战胜困难，保证战争达到胜利，因此，张同志响亮的号召：向旱灾作斗争，大家拿出四二、四三年克服灾荒的精神，拿出四三、四四年克服蝗灾的精神，只要我们不是等待，不是靠天吃饭，而是依靠我们的组织，我们的力量，坚决向天灾作斗争，我们就会克服困难。张同志具体指示：全区机关部队带头领导群众实行挑水点种，动员与组织男女全半劳动力，组织所有的井水浇地，多种一颗庄稼，就减少一分困难，一个人的力量是种不了多少的，但把所有的力量都组织起来，就可以减少灾荒的程度。加以沿河各县，修黄打堤、青壮年参军、参战、农村劳动力空前减少，所以机关部队必须把帮助群众挑水点种、分苗锄地、收麦打场、麦收下雨时帮助抢种等，作为自己的一个重要工作，并定为机关部队同志为人民立功的条件之一。关于备荒问题，张同志说：今年麦收估计可有五成，我们在开始时就要节约。号召大家每天节约二两粮食，反对铺张切实减少开支，（减少村开支在内），一切不必要的开支一律停止，坚决实行精兵简政，合并类似机关，裁撤后方机关，编余人员一律转入战斗部队、经济部门或去发动群众；并号召大家献出私人积蓄。最后张同志号召党员起带头作用，引导全区群众，组织起来防旱抢种，切实节约备荒。
    【本报冀鲁豫二日电】各县结合防旱备荒，继续展开生产节约运动。六专署于本月九日召开各机关干部大会，号召节衣缩食。杨副专员提出“一个人节省一把米，公家少作一分难”的口号，各机关当即形成节约热潮。现私人已节约衣服、鞋袜、津贴等小米三万三千五百五十斤，机关经费自给小米六千六百三十四斤，邮局自给三个月。傅平县亦已掀起节约支援前线热潮，五区公安派出所全体同志将领的衣服、鞋袜、菜金等费全部节约，自己开荒种菜；区公所派出所同志将刨树得来的报酬五千多元捐送前方；九区市场准庄群众捐款三千五百四十元送前方；六区六十三户贫苦军、工、烈属将优待粮九千二百二十四斤全部节约送给前方；二区北部村庄自动发起红白事来往客人节约条例，不用烟酒。
