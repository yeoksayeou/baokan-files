Jincheng News Agency Report: Since the Eighth District launched the production campaign, in just half a month, the work style and morale of district and village cadres, and the masses' enthusiasm for supporting the war and production efforts have undergone new changes. Cadres have overcome the past phenomenon of "only talking and not acting," personally participating in mutual aid labor and directly leading and promoting the rush to weed seedlings. Starting on the 20th of last month, all men, women, and children in the district were involved in the weeding campaign. In just ten days, five administrative villages, including Dongshi Weng and Bei Shi Weng, had rushed to weed all the small seedlings. In addition to weeding over 600 mu of millet seedlings, Bei Po also weeded 140 mu of corn. The village implemented a major change in mutual aid, implemented work points. Before seedling, the He Lian organization organized women to push millstones and grinders, preparing ten days of rice and flour. Men chopped ten days of firewood, took dry food to the fields during weeding, and old women cooked rice porridge in the fields, not returning home for lunch, rushing to complete the work. Dongshi Weng fully mobilized, and in just seven days and one afternoon, they weeded all the millet seedlings. Li Manjiao village, with 48 full and semi-laborers, weeded more than 200 mu of millet seedlings in five days. Shuangmiao completed the rush to weed seedlings under the combination of labor and military affairs. Military dependents and revolutionary martyrs are adding to their contributions. In Beipo, the martyr's family member Wu Shunqing led the mutual aid group with even greater enthusiasm. He first formulated a production campaign plan to promote a campaign competition within the group. The group, with 17 full and semi-laborers, weeded 44 mu of millet seedlings in five days, and also weeded eight mu of corn. Retired soldier Huang Li and Yunsheng are determined to run a good mutual aid group. Zhang Lukou and Liu Deshui, although half disabled, are determined to participate in mutual aid labor and declined the preferential treatment offered by the masses. In addition to participating in the rush to weed seedlings, women and children also did a lot of logistical work to support the front lines. Women in villages such as Dajingtou and Liushukou organized stretcher teams to transfer sick and wounded soldiers, and organized reception stations, saving male labor to support long-distance transport.
