　　Locust Nymphs Spread in Gaoyi Shahe
    Villages Establish Locust Eradication Headquarters
    [Report from Gaoyi] Locust nymphs have been widely discovered in the first, third, and fourth districts of Gaoyi. According to statistics, 29 villages spanning over 20 li from north to south and 8 li from east to west have been affected. The most severely affected villages are Dongtaying and Gangtou, where six or seven nymphs can be swatted with a single slap. Over 90 mu of grain seedlings have been completely consumed in Dongtaying and Xinzhuang, while over 300 mu of grain seedlings have been devoured piece by piece in Gangtou Village, Xicun, and Gangnan. Cereal stem borers have also been discovered in over ten villages. According to statistics from seven villages, over 480 mu of grain seedlings have been damaged by these borers. In response to this situation, county leaders convened an emergency meeting of all districts on June 5th, deciding to establish a locust and insect eradication headquarters at the county level. In addition to establishing locust and insect eradication groups in each district, a joint locust and insect eradication headquarters was established for the first, third, and fourth districts. Each district will assign a responsible cadre to specifically lead this effort, constantly surveying and understanding the situation, and concentrating efforts to eliminate the pests. Each village will establish a locust and insect eradication committee and organize a large team. Due to the current focus on harvesting wheat, it has been decided to primarily organize children and women to carry out the eradication. (Wen Yan, Kong You, Ji Sheng)
    [Report from Shahe] Nymphs have spread from seven villages to thirteen villages in the sixth district, with three to five nymphs per square foot across 33.3 hectares of land. A small number of flying locusts have also appeared. According to reports from various villages, over 40 mu of young seedlings have already been eaten. The district head and secretary, seeing the seriousness of the situation, decided that each village should establish a locust eradication headquarters, with the district setting up a locust eradication headquarters to unify command. With the current focus on planting, the slogan "One hand planting, one hand swatting locusts" has been put forward. A total of 1,500 people from the thirteen villages go to the fields every day to swat locusts. The district and village locust eradication headquarters are also drawing on neighboring villages or organizing locust swatting teams to jointly combat the locusts, based on the size of the affected area. (Gao Meng, Cong Li)
    [Report from Southern Hebei, 14th] Locust nymphs have been successively discovered in the fourth district of Wei County, covering an area of approximately 4-5 hectares. Most have now been eliminated. Locust nymphs have been discovered west of Changzhong Village and Zhengjiazhuang Village in the seventh district of Cheng'an and Cixian, mainly in rapeseed and open fields. The masses are currently making every effort to eradicate them. A considerable number of locust nymphs have also been discovered in villages around Changshezhuang in the third district of Handan. The district is currently working on organizing the masses to eliminate them.
