　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 19th: Two to three hundred remnants of Yan’s stubborn troops, such as the "Fencheng Security Police Brigade," who were roaming the border area between Xinjiang and Fencheng, are now handing over their weapons one after another after local guerrillas and militiamen called on them to return home to engage in production. In the past half month, more than two hundred rifles and twenty light machine guns have been handed over. Zhang Wenbin, the former platoon leader of the "Security Police Brigade," not only handed over his guns but also dug out a heavy machine gun buried near a bunker in the city and handed it over to the democratic government. The masses in Xili Village, Fencheng, voluntarily reported a large kiln of ammunition secretly stored by Yan's stubborn troops to the democratic government. Now, all the scattered soldiers of Yan's puppet regime have been cleared from the entire territory of Fencheng. Furthermore, in the ten days from the 4th to the 13th of this month, a total of more than two hundred Yan's puppet personnel continued to register with the democratic government and repent.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 19th: A unit of the local armed forces in Xinxian County attacked the stronghold of Yan’s stubborn troops at Xiazuo (more than twenty miles south of Xinxian city) on the east side of the Tongpu Railway on the morning of the 15th, and all the defending enemies were annihilated. A battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the 39th Division of the Yan Army stationed in Mahui Town came to reinforce, but was also defeated, and part of it was annihilated. A total of fifty Yan army personnel, including the deputy battalion commander and below, were killed or wounded, eighty-eight were captured alive, and three small cannons, one light machine gun, and seventy-three rifles were seized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 14th: Branch reporter Ma Ming reported: In the battle to liberate Xiangning, two-thirds of the more than eighty wounded Yan soldiers rescued by the People's Liberation Army were wounded by Yan’s officers in the "Enforcement Team." During the treatment, they all complained about this crime of Yan’s stubborn troops. Tang Haiqing and another soldier from the 3rd Platoon of the 9th Company of the 204th Regiment of the Yan Army tearfully recounted how they were wounded by platoon leader Zhang Jinan on the battlefield, saying, "We didn't charge forward, and the platoon leader threw two grenades, killing the deputy platoon leader and another soldier, and crippling both of us." Shi Yingcai, a machine gunner from the same unit's 9th Company, said, "I was lying in the trench, just about to shoot at the Eighth Route Army that was charging up, when the battalion commander shot a burst of bullets at me with his pistol, wounding me." Another soldier said, "After being wounded, the platoon leader wouldn't let me leave the front line, but instead stabbed me in the leg with a bayonet." These wounded soldiers were carefully treated by the military doctors and nurses of the People's Liberation Army. In the past week, more than sixty lightly wounded soldiers have been cured and provided with funds to return to their already liberated hometowns.

　　汾城溃散之敌
    络绎悔过自新
    忻县地方武装歼敌百余
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】流窜于新绛汾城边境之阎顽“汾城保警大队”等残部二三百人，经当地游击队和民兵号召彼等回家生产，现纷纷交出武器。近半月已交出步枪二百余支，轻机枪二十余挺，原“保警大队”排长张文斌除缴出枪支外，并将埋藏城内碉堡附近之重机枪一挺挖出交给民主政府。汾城西里村群众，自动将阎顽秘密储藏之军火一大窑呈报民主政府，现汾城全境，阎伪散兵已全部肃清。又本月四日到十三日十天中，阎伪人员续向民主政府自动登记悔过者，共有二百余人。
    【新华社晋绥十九日电】忻县地方武装一部，于十五日晨袭入同蒲路东侧之阎顽下佐据点（忻县城南二十余里），守敌全部被歼。驻麻会镇之阎军三十九师三团一个营前来增援，亦被击溃，歼其一部。共毙伤阎军正副大队长以下五十名，生俘八十八名，缴获小炮三门，轻机枪一挺，步枪七十三支。
    【新华社晋绥十四日电】分社记者马明报导：解放乡宁之役，为解放军救治之八十余名阎军伤兵，三分之二都是被阎军官“执法队”所击伤。救治时，彼等纷起控诉阎顽此种罪行。阎军二○四团九连三排士兵唐海青等两人哭诉在阵地上被排长张金安打伤情形说：“我们没有往上冲，排长就掷过来两个手榴弹，排副和另一士兵倒毙，我们两人都被炸成残废。”该部九连机枪射手史应才说：“我躺在战壕里，正要向冲上来的八路军射击，营长手枪便朝我打了一梭子弹，把我打挂彩了。”另一士兵说：“受伤后，排长不让我下火线，反向我腿上穿了一刺刀。”这些伤兵经解放军军医护士悉心为他们治疗，一周来已有六十余个轻伤者治愈，资送返回已经解放的家乡。
