　　No. 18
　　Shexian Office:
　　The continuous reports organized by your county's correspondent comrades on launching a meritorious service campaign to welcome "July 1st" are very good. It is hoped that you will continue to focus on reflecting the achievements and experiences of the movement, commend model branches, model party member cadres, and the growth of new work styles, and select one or two typical examples to vividly and concretely depict their deeds in leading the masses to turn over a new leaf in the past decade, the sooner the better.

　　To comrades of correspondents in various regions: Many of the received manuscripts recently have been affected by illegible handwriting, which has affected their adoption. It is hoped that in the future, when writing or copying, do not be careless and strive for clarity, leaving slightly wider spaces between lines. It is hoped that statistical figures will be accurate.

　　通讯往来
    第十八号涉县办公室：
    你县通讯员同志所组织的迎接“七一”开展立功运动的连续报导很好，希继续抓紧反映运动的成绩与经验，表扬模范支部、模范党员干部新作风的成长，并选择一二典型，连系十年来领导群众翻身事迹予以生动而具体的描绘，越快越好。
    各地通讯员同志：最近收到之来稿，不少由于字迹不清，影响了采用，希今后写字或复写，不要潦草，力求清楚，行与行间留空白稍宽一些；统计数字力求准确为盼。
