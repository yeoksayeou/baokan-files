　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 26th: (Delayed) Our frontline special correspondent reports: A certain unit under the command of General Lin Biao, after twelve days and nights of unprecedented siege warfare, has annihilated and captured more than 16,000 enemies. Since the main force of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army launched a counter-offensive in the summer offensive on the Chang (chun) Shen (yang) section of the main trunk of the Middle East Railway, they first cleared out the enemies south of Changchun and north of Siping, and then marched south to recover Kaiyuan and Changtu in succession, putting the enemy in Siping in an isolated position. In order to crush the enemy's intention to restore the Middle East Railway, a general attack was launched against the enemy in Siping on the night of the 14th of this month. After twelve days and nights of bloody street battles, they successively captured the enemy's modern fortifications and dense bunkers that had been operating for more than a year, and destroyed the enemy's six joint and strong defense positions. The 71st Army headquarters, direct artillery regiment, special service regiment, transportation regiment, engineer battalion, and the entire Provisional 3rd Division, as well as the 87th Division (missing one regiment), the 54th Division of the 13th Army (missing one regiment), the Liaobei Security 1st Regiment, the Security 17th Regiment, and the Traffic Police Corps of the Chiang-Du army Chen Mingren Corps were eliminated, killing more than 10,000 enemies below the deputy chief of staff of the 71st Army, and capturing more than 6,000 enemies below Chen Mingxin (Chen Mingren's younger brother), the head of the special service regiment directly under the 71st Army, including 183 officers who had arrived by airlift from Nanjing. A small number of remaining enemies have nowhere to escape and are being encircled and annihilated by the Democratic Allied Army in the northeast corner of the city east of the railway. Most of Siping is now under our control.
