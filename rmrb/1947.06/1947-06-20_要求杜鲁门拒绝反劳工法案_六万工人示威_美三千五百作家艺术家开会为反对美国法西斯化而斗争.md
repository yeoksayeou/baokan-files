　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: New York dispatch: Following a demonstration by 50,000 members of the American Federation of Labor against the anti-labor bill of Taft et al., 60,000 members of the Congress of Industrial Organizations held a similar demonstration in Madison Square on the 11th, demanding that Truman reject the anti-labor bill of Taft et al. Under pressure from the masses, according to U.S. Senator Wagner, Truman may refuse to endorse the bill.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS, New York dispatch: A conference of 3,500 writers and artists, sponsored by the new literary magazine *Mainstream*, has been held. Leading American writers and artists spoke out, criticizing the House Un-American Activities Committee for undermining the expression of democratic art. Hollywood screenwriter Lawson said: "The attempt to stifle the speech of writers and artists is a necessary part of the plan of big business to destroy trade unions and restore fascism throughout the world. This attempt will be resisted by every artist who cares about the dignity of his profession and the welfare of the country." Playwright Dosian read a speech by screenwriter Trumbo, who was unable to attend the meeting. Trumbo also sharply criticized the "House Un-American Activities Committee." Famous painter Evergood criticized the anti-cultural policies of American government officials, especially Secretary of State Marshall's recent cancellation of art exhibitions that had toured Europe and Latin America, and criticized Truman's alleged remarks that modern art was "worthless bull." Black singer Paul Robeson warned in his speech against the danger of the concentration of American fascist forces in large monopoly groups. When Robeson said, "The reactionaries have thrown down the glove (note: meaning a challenge), but I pick it up and throw it back in their faces," he won great applause. Other speakers, including writer José Yglesias, black playwright Ward, *New Masses* magazine editor Magil, and *Chairman* editor Chillen, all urged a struggle against American fascist tendencies.

　　要求杜鲁门拒绝反劳工法案
    六万工人示威
    美三千五百作家艺术家开会为反对美国法西斯化而斗争
    【新华社陕北十六日电】纽约讯：继劳工联合会五万人示威反对塔虎脱等之反劳工法案之后，美国产业工会联合会六万会员又于十一日在麦迪逊广场举行同类的示威游行，要求杜鲁门拒绝认可塔虎脱等之反劳工法案。在群众的压力下，据美参议员华格纳说，杜鲁门或将拒绝认可此一法案。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社纽约讯：新文学杂志《主流》主办下的三千五百个作家与艺术家大会顷已开会，美国主要作家及艺术家演讲抨击众院“违反美国利益行动调查委员会”破坏了民主艺术的表现。好莱坞电影剧本作者劳逊说：“箝制作家同艺术家言论的企图是大企业要破坏职工会并在全世界恢复法西斯之计划的必要部分，这种企图将遭受到每一个顾及自己职业的尊严及国家福利的艺术家的反抗。”戏剧作家杜西安宣读未能出席会议的电影剧本，作者特鲁穆波的演辞，特氏也尖锐抨击“违反美国利益行动调查委员会”，著名画家爱佛古德抨击美国政府官员的反文化政策，尤其是国务卿马歇尔最近取消了曾经遍历欧洲及拉丁美洲各国的艺术展览，并抨击传说中的杜鲁门所谓现代艺术为“蠢牛无用”的论调。黑人歌唱家保罗·鲁宾逊在其演辞中警告称：要防备在大独占集团中美国法西斯力量集中的危险。当鲁宾逊说到“反动派们把手套掷下来（按：意念挑战），但是我拾起它来并投回到他们的脸上去”时，博得了大的喝采。其他讲演者作家姚乐赛·派克，黑人剧作家华德，《新群众》杂志编者马基尔及“主席”编者席仑，均敦促为反对美国的法西斯倾向而斗争。
