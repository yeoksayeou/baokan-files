　　Tsinghua Students Launch Off-Campus Propaganda
　　Opposing Chiang Kai-shek's Conscription and Grain Requisition
　　[Our Newspaper] According to Tianjin newspapers: During the "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Hunger" strike movement, wall posters at various universities in Beiping are extremely active. The joint wall poster edition of Peking University proposed "Our Attitude," believing that opposing the civil war is the fundamental issue. "In order to survive, oppose the civil war!" It advocates investigating and settling the responsibility for the civil war and demands the establishment of a "democratic united government." The wall poster content also exposes news of the Chiang army's major defeats.
　　When Tsinghua University began its strike on the 17th, the school's "Anti-Civil War, Anti-Hunger Strike Protest Committee" issued a proclamation on the same day stating: "…Today, prices are rising frantically, the economy is rapidly collapsing, and the domestic situation has reached its most dangerous stage. The cause of this phenomenon lies in the civil war, which destroys a large amount of property, causes inflation, sends prices soaring, and leads the people step by step to the road of death. Therefore, in order to improve the people's lives and save the nation from peril, we are using a strike as our painful protest." Subsequently, the following slogans were put forward: "1. The people want to eat; 2. The people want to live; 3. Oppose the policy of unification by force; 4. Long-term ceasefire, permanent ceasefire; 5. Establish a united national government; 6. If the civil war does not stop, the people will starve to death; 7. Stop conscription; 8. Stop grain requisition; 9. The people and the students are one family; 10. Long live the democratic new China." The Strike Committee printed propaganda materials all night long. Although students ate corn buns that were not enough to fill their stomachs, they still enthusiastically donated money for paper and printing costs. On the 17th, the school raised more than 500,000 yuan in donations in one day. New songs "Can't Afford to Live" and "What to Do This Year" are among the propaganda materials of the Strike Committee. Hundreds of students launched off-campus propaganda, singing: "No planting rice, no planting wheat, Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers don't produce, don't produce. Fields turn into battlefields, people turn into ashes, fighting kills millions, fighting kills millions." The last sentence is "Officials want the people to die, the people are not willing; rising up from a sea of blood, stand up!"

　　清华学生展开校外宣传
    反对蒋党征兵征粮
    【本报讯】据天津报纸透露：在“反内战、反饥饿”的罢课运动中，北平各大学壁报极活跃，北大壁报联合版提出“我们的态度”，认为反内战是基本的问题，“为了要活下去，反对内战！”主张追究清算内战责任，要求成立“民主的联合政府”。壁报内容并揭露蒋军大败之军事消息。
    清华大学于十七日起开始罢课时，该校“反内战、反饥饿罢课抗议委员会”于当天发出布告说：“………今天物价在疯狂上涨，经济在加速崩溃，国内局势已到了最危险的阶段。造成这现象的原因在于内战，使大量的财产毁灭，使通货膨胀，使物价飞跃，使人民一步一步走向死亡的道路。因此，为了改善人民的生活，为了拯救祖国的危亡，我们以罢课作为我们沉痛的抗议”。继提出口号：“一、老百姓要吃饭；二、老百姓要活命；三、反对武力统一政策；四、长期停战，永久停战；五、成立全国一致联合政府；六、内战不止，人民饿死；七、停止征兵；八、停止征粮；九、老百姓和同学是一家人；十、民主新中国万岁。”罢课委会并彻夜印刷宣传品，同学们虽吃窝窝头尚不足饱肚，仍踊跃捐款作纸张印刷费，十七日一日校内募捐即得五十余万元。新歌“活不起”及“这个年头怎么办”为罢委会宣传品之一。数百学生展开校外宣传，高唱：“不种米，不种麦，拉丁当兵不生产，不生产。田变战场，人变灰，打仗打死几百万，打仗打死几百万。”末句为“官要民死，民不甘；血海翻身，站起来！”
