Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to TASS, Budapest: US Representative to the Allied Control Council for Hungary, Brigadier General George H. Weems, sent a letter on the 11th to the Acting Chairman of the Allied Control Council, Lieutenant General Sviridov, accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in Hungary's internal affairs and demanding the establishment of a so-called "Three-Power Committee" to investigate the situation in Hungary in order to achieve its goal of interference. Lieutenant General Sviridov has issued a stern rebuttal, stating in brief: The claim in the letter that "the reorganization of the Hungarian government violates the will of the majority of the Hungarian people and establishes control by a minority" is a completely unfounded fabrication. As is well known, the Hungarian cabinet crisis was due to former Prime Minister Nagy, disregarding the instructions of the Hungarian government and the leadership of the Smallholders Party, refusing to return to the country, which led to his subsequent automatic resignation. The new Hungarian cabinet, led by Prime Minister Dinnyés and formed in accordance with the constitution, maintained the original distribution of ministerial positions among the parties in the coalition government, and the new government has gained the trust of the vast majority of the Hungarian people. All these facts have been widely publicized, and you are undoubtedly aware of them. Studying your letter, I cannot help but notice the attempt to provide assistance, under the pretext of defending Hungarian democracy, to individual exiles who are connected with treasonous conspirators and have fled abroad. As for your statement that I, at Nagy's request, handed over the investigative materials of the Kovács case to the Hungarian government (note: Kovács was arrested by the Soviet military authorities on February 15 for activities endangering the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary), which you consider to be a violation of paragraph 6 of the Allied Control Council regulations, this is based on a misunderstanding. As I pointed out in my letter of June 9, 1946, the materials on this matter are not related to the jurisdiction of the Allied Control Council. Based on the above views, I reject your protest because it is unfounded. I do not believe that there has been any unilateral action on our part that violates the Yalta Agreement, and I also believe that the part of your statement concerning Soviet interference in Hungary's internal affairs is also a fabrication. Considering these points, I cannot agree to your suggestion to establish a "Three-Power Committee" to investigate the situation in Hungary, because I consider this unnecessary and believe that it would constitute a crude interference in Hungary's internal affairs, and such interference is not permissible.

　　盟国对匈管委会代理主席
    驳斥美代表无理要求
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：盟国对匈管制委员会美国代表乔治·维斯准将于十一日致函盟国管制委员会代理主席斯维芮多夫中将，污蔑苏联干涉匈国内政，并要求成立所谓“三强委员会”调查匈国情况，以达其干涉之目的。斯维芮多夫中将已予严正驳复，略称：来函所谓“匈政府改组违反匈大多数人民的意志，建立少数人的控制”等，完全是没有根据的捏造。如众所周知，匈内阁危机是由于前总理奈基不顾匈政府及小地主党领导机关的训令，拒绝回国，以致他后来自动辞职。丁尼斯总理领导的按宪法所组成的匈牙利新内阁保持了联合政府中各党派间原有部长职位的分配，新政府已获得匈牙利绝大多数人民的信任。所有这些事实都已广为公布，无疑的你也是知道的。研究你的来信，我不能不注意到在保卫匈牙利民主的借口下，给那些与叛国阴谋者有牵连而逃往外国的个别流亡分子以援助的企图。至于你的声明所认为的我依照奈基的请求，将科瓦克案件的调查材料交与匈政府（按：科瓦克系因进行危害驻匈苏军的活动，于二月十五日被苏军当局逮捕。）这就算破坏了盟国管委会法规的第六段，这是基于误解的。正像我在一九四六年六月九日的信中所指出的，这问题的材料与盟国管委会的职权无关。基于上述观点，我拒绝你的抗议，因为那是毫无根据的。我认为我方并无破坏雅尔塔协议的片面行动，我又认为你声明中有关苏联干涉匈国内政的部分也是捏造的。我考虑了这些，我不能同意你的成立“三强委员会”调查匈牙利情况的建议，因为我认为这是不必要的，并且认为这会成为对匈牙利内政的粗鲁干涉，而这种干涉是不能允许的。
