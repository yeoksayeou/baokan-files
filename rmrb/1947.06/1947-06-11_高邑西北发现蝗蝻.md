[Our Newspaper Gaoyi Dispatch] Locust nymphs have been discovered in the vicinity of Dongtaying Village North in the First, Third, and Fourth Districts northwest of the city, Liangjia Village South (west of the Pinghan Railway), Gangtou Village, Nancun West, and Nancun Southeast (east of the Pinghan Railway). The area affected by locust nymphs stretches over five li from east to west and three li from north to south. They are everywhere except for bare land without grass or seedlings. The locust nymphs, as large as soybeans, only eat autumn grain seedlings. After their discovery on May 31st, by the morning of June 3rd, they had already devoured more than 30 mu in the Dongtaying area. In Gangtou Village, Nancun West, and Nancun Southeast, 70-80% of the grain seedlings have been eaten. On June 3rd, Zhang, the Deputy County Magistrate of this county, along with the Head of the Construction Section, personally went to the Dongtaying area to mobilize the masses to eradicate the pests.
