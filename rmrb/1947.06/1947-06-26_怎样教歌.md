How to Teach Songs
    By Xuan Zhenye, Propaganda Team, Taihang First Military Sub-district

    When the two of us arrived at the "Zhang Fei Troop" First District Cadre Team, we didn't hear them singing. When they did sing, it was only Yangge tunes. When they arrived at a place, they would just sleep if they had nothing to do. Now there are songs to sing, and it's very common. Whether it's cadres, soldiers, or cooks, everyone can sing. They also learn songs very quickly. They learned seven songs in eight days, and three of them in half a day. The reason for the speed is this:

    1.  Inspire enthusiasm for learning songs; don't fall behind other teams.

    2.  Cultivate key individuals who learn songs well and quickly. Praise them, let them lead everyone in singing, and select them as cultural and entertainment committee members.

    3.  Regardless of how many people there are, seize the time and teach whenever there is a spare moment. When walking, when resting, in short, take advantage of every opportunity.

    4.  When you find sentences that are difficult to sing, teach those sentences several times. Once the difficulty is resolved, it becomes easier to learn, and the learners also become more interested.

    5.  Explain the meaning, grasp the rhythm, express emotions, and arouse the soldiers' interest in learning. For example, when teaching the song "Transportation Captain Chiang Kai-shek," I used simple facial expressions and actions, as if Chiang Kai-shek was in front of me. They learned with interest, forgot their fatigue, and learned with energy.

    Finally, the most important point is that the person teaching the song must be patient, not impatient, and not think that the soldiers are "stupid." You must have a spirit of serving the soldiers in order to teach well and meet the soldiers' "need to sing."

　　怎样教歌
    太行一分区宣传队  宣珍业书
    我们两人到“张飞部”一区干队去时，听不到他们唱歌，偶尔唱的也都是秧歌调。到了一个地方，没事就睡觉。现在有歌子唱了，而且很普遍，不论干部、战士、炊事员都会唱。学歌也学的很快，八天就学会了七个歌，其中有一个半天就学会了三个。快的原因，是这样：
    一、鼓动起学歌的热情；不要落在别队的后面。
    二、培养学歌学得好、快的骨干分子。表扬他们，让他们带领大家唱，选他们做文化娱乐委员。
    三、不管人多人少，抓紧时间有空就教。走路时，休息时，总之利用一切机会。
    四、发现难唱的句子，就特别把那几句多教几遍。困难解决了就好学了，学的人也有兴趣了。
    五、解释意思，掌握节拍、表现情感、引起战士学习的兴趣。如教《运输队长蒋介石》歌时，我就带了简单的面部表情和动作，就像是蒋介石在我面前似的，他们学的有了意思，就忘记了疲倦，学的就带劲了。
    最后，最重要的一点，是教歌的人要耐心，不要性急，不要觉得战士“笨”，要有为兵服务的精神，才能教得好，才能满足战士“要歌唱”的要求。
