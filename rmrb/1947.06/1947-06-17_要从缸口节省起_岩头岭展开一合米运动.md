　　Start Saving from the Rice Jar
    Yantouling Launches a "One He of Rice" Movement
    [Our newspaper, Licheng News] After Wang Tonghui, a labor hero from Yantouling in the Sixth District, formulated his own production and conservation plan, he led everyone in the people's school to discuss preparations for disaster relief. At first, some said, "Yantouling has managed to secure the seedlings; I don't think it's a problem." Some said, "Shanxi will not fail to harvest grain." Others said, "Spring is dry, so autumn will definitely have more rain; it's suitable to plant late millet this year." After discovering this kind of thinking, they raised the questions, "Did everyone suffer in 1943?" and "If we eat and drink wastefully and use up the grain, what will we eat when the famine year comes?" Li Jinbiao said, "Yantouling has managed to secure some seedlings this year, but some places still haven't been planted!" Zhao Lianhui said, "When I think of 1943, my whole family ate mostly corn husks, and it was so hard to defecate. How can we endure that again!" Li Deming said, "If we don't conserve now and eat to the bottom of the jar, it will probably be too late to save." Wang Wenping said, "We must eat more bran and vegetables, save grain, and prevent famine!" Tonghui immediately announced his plan to the masses to save one *he* of rice and half a *sheng* of corn per day, and let everyone discuss it. Everyone unanimously agreed that Tonghui's conservation production plan for disaster relief was very suitable, so they all formulated their own plans. Some wanted to mix bran with grain in a 3:7 ratio, and some wanted to mix bran and grain in a 1:1 ratio. The women all formulated production and conservation plans. For example, the eight women in Fan Lao's group planned to save eight *sheng* of millet and two *dou* and three *sheng* of corn in ten days. Qiao Feng's mother-in-law has already started eating bran noodles. Her family of four and a half will save two *he* of millet and five *he* of corn every day. Mo Chun'e proposed to use one *sheng* of corn and two *sheng* of bran to save grain and survive the disaster. Now, the entire village of Yanling, men and women, has launched a "One *He* of Rice" movement, and children and women have also started going to the fields to collect wild vegetables.

    [Our newspaper, Zuoquan News] The entire village of Silizhuang in the Fifth District has formulated a conservation and disaster preparedness plan. Comrade Wang Shimin, the political director, started with his own family. According to his family's past annual grain consumption, it was not enough. After calculating the total, he can save four *shi* and five *dou* of grain this year, saving three *liang* of rice per person per day, supplemented with bran and vegetables. After he set the plan, it influenced the entire village to save three *liang* of rice per person per day. First, the groups and teams formulated conservation plans and used practical examples to get through everyone's thinking. For example, Lao Wang said, "In the past, there was a family in Shahe with three daughters-in-law. The eldest and second daughters-in-law did not conserve. The third daughter-in-law saved a handful of rice every time she cooked rice. As a result, when a famine broke out three years later, she had saved four *shi* of rice. The eldest and second daughters-in-law were starving and helpless, but the third daughter-in-law did not feel the hardship." After saying this, the masses remembered the suffering during the famine years and launched a conservation wave. Now, the entire village can save 983 *liang* of rice per day, saving more than 1,700 *jin* of rice per year. After he talked about this at the joint defense cadre meeting, it influenced other villages to set conservation plans as well. (Xian He, Bao Sheng, Zi Sheng, Fu Yin, Bao Ren)

　　要从缸口节省起
    岩头岭展开一合米运动
    【本报黎城讯】六区岩头岭劳动英雄王同会自己订生产节约计划后，即在民校领导大家讨论备荒。一开始有的说：“岩头岭都捉住苗啦，我看不要紧。”有的说：“山西就不会不收粮。”还有的说：“春天旱秋天一定雨多，今年宜种晚谷。”发现这种思想后，又提出“四三年大家受过制没有，”“现把粮食大吃二喝费完了灾荒年来了大家吃什么？”李金彪说：“岩头岭今年算是强捉住些苗，可是有些地方到现在还没有种上地哩！”赵连会说：“想起四三年我全家吃玉茭壳多，吃到肚里大便不下来，怎受来呀！”李德明说：“现在不节约吃到缸底，想省恐怕也晚啦，”王文屏说：“咱可得多吃糠菜，节约粮食，防灾荒哩！”同会当即把自己每天节约一合米、半升玉茭等计划向群众宣布了，让大家讨论。大家一致认为同会的节约生产渡荒计划很宜合，就都纷纷订出各家的计划，有的要三七掺糠，有的要对半掺糠。妇女们都订出节约生产计划，如范老改小组八个妇女在十天内要节省小米八升，玉茭二斗三升，巧逢家娘已吃开糠面，她家每天四口半人要节省小米二合，玉茭五合，莫春娥提出要一升玉茭二升糠来节省粮食渡灾荒。现在岩岭领全村男女已展开了一合米运动，儿童妇女也开始上地采野菜。（岩头岭通讯小组）
    【本报左权讯】五区四里庄村全定出了节约备荒计划，政治主任王世民同志首先从自己家做起，按过去他家一年的粮食算下来不够用，经算总账后今年能省粮四石五斗，每人一天省米三两，用糠和菜补助。经他定了计划，影响了全村每人一天省米三两。先以组以队订出了节约计划，并用实际例子，打通大家思想，如老王说：“以前沙河有一家妯娌三人，大、二两媳不节约，三媳妇在每次下米时省一把米，结果三年头上闹灾荒，共省下米四石，大、二两媳妇饿肚无法，三媳妇可没有感到困难。”经过这样一说，群众都想起了灾荒年时苦，掀起了节约浪潮，现在全村一天可省米九百八十三两，全年省米一千七百余斤。在中联防开干部会时，经他这样谈了后，影响了其他村也定下了节约计划。（仙荷、保生、子胜、福银、保仁）
