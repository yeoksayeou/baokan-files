Xinhua News Agency, Shaanxi North, June 6th: According to TASS, Sofia: Local newspapers recently published Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov's answers to questions posed by Daily Mail reporter John Fisher. The following are the main points of the response: Regarding the Bulgarian peace treaty, Dimitrov said: The Bulgarian government and people hope for the most rapid ratification of the treaty. The effects of delaying ratification are clearly negative. It will inevitably delay the determination of relations between Bulgaria and the United States, and will also delay Bulgaria's accession to the United Nations, which is not in accordance with the understanding between the Bulgarian and American people and the interests of peace in the Balkans and the world. Regarding Truman's recent speech on the situation in the Balkans, Dimitrov said: I believe that the speech made by the US President at a time like this encourages anti-democratic groups and the remnants of fascist rule. Therefore, it cannot lead to peace and democracy. Regarding British-Bulgarian relations, Dimitrov said: I believe that the improvement of British-Bulgarian relations mainly depends on Britain. The Bulgarian people hope that Britain understands and respects their legitimate rights and interests, which does not threaten universal peace and will not infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of the British people. The Bulgarian government is prepared to promote trade relations between the two countries in complete reciprocity and good faith, according to the wishes of Britain. Moreover, Bulgaria is currently enhancing the development of political, economic, and cultural relations between the British and Bulgarian people. Regarding whether Bulgaria will re-propose the issue of an outlet to the Aegean Sea, Dimitrov said: Bulgaria naturally cannot abandon her rights based on justice and recognized by many international treaties. She was unjustly deprived of this right by violence, but as a loyal supporter of the principles of the United Nations, Bulgaria will seek a decision on this important issue within the organization and charter of the United Nations. Regarding whether Salonika becoming a free port can satisfy Bulgaria's demands, Dimitrov said: He very much doubts that the possibility of Bulgaria obtaining a truly free port in Salonika can satisfy her demands. He said: The Greek monarchy still exists there, which is extremely hostile to Bulgaria and is trying to annex some of Bulgaria's territory; I think all talk about a free port in Salonika is meaningless. Regarding the Bulgarian-Yugoslav alliance, Dimitrov said: Although there is a close fraternal relationship between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, there is no alliance yet. I sincerely wish and, in accordance with the will of the Bulgarian people, strive to conclude a long-term alliance, friendship, and mutual assistance treaty between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. Regarding the opposition, Dimitrov said: On some occasions, the government has been forced to take steps against the opposition's propaganda organs and their individual leaders in accordance with national laws, only because of the opposition's anti-national and anti-people actions. In the future, the government will also unhesitatingly use the strictest republican laws to deal with those opposition organs and their leaders. They maliciously and blindly engage in intentional agitation to oppose the most important issues in the government's program for the People's Republic, especially regarding the implementation of the two-year national economic plan approved by the National Assembly. At the same time, I must particularly emphasize that we are not opposed to the existence of the opposition.

　　季米特洛夫答记者问：
    杜鲁门关于巴尔干局势的讲演
    鼓励法西斯残余违反和平民主
    【新华社陕北六日电】据塔斯社索非亚讯：此间报纸顷发表保加利亚总理季米特洛夫对每日邮报记者约翰·费歇尔所提问题之答复。以下为该项答复之要点：关于对保和约问题，季氏说：保国政府及人民希望最迅速地批准和约。延迟批准所产生的影响显然是不好的，这必定延迟保美两国间关系之确定，也将延迟保国加入联合国，这和保美两国人民的谅解及巴尔干与世界和平之利益是不符合的。关于杜鲁门最近关于巴尔干局势的演讲，季氏说：我认为美总统在目前这样一个时候所作的讲演，鼓励了反民主集团和法西斯统治的残余。因此是不能引向和平民主的。关于英保关系，季氏说：我相信英保关系的增进主要的要靠英国。保国人民希望英国了解并尊重他们的合法权利与利益，这是毫不威胁普遍和平，而且也不会侵害英国人民的合法权益的。保国政府准备依英国的愿望，以完全互惠及善意，促进两国贸易关系。而且保国现正在增进英保人民间政治、经济与文化关系的发展。关于保国是否将重提爱琴海出海口的问题，季氏说：保国自然不能放弃她基于正义的并为许多国际条约所承认的权利。她被不正义的暴力剥夺了这个权利，但是为忠诚拥护联合国的原则，保国将在联合国的组织及宪章中寻取这个重要问题的决定。关于萨罗尼加成为自由港是否可以满足保国的要求，季氏称：他非常怀疑保国在荫罗尼加获得真正自由港的可能性能够满足她的要求。他说：现在该地仍然存在着希腊君主政体，它对保国是极端仇视的，而且正力图吞并保国的某些领土；我认为一切关于萨罗尼加自由港的谈论都是无意思的。关于保南同盟问题，季氏说：保南之间虽存在着亲密的兄弟关系，但还无同盟存在。我诚恳的愿望并按照保国人民的意志，努力去缔结保南间的长期同盟友好互助条约。关于反对派的问题，季氏说：在某些场合中政府被迫按照国家法律采取对付反对派言论机关及其个别领袖的步骤，只是由于反对派的反国家与反人民的行动而引起的。政府在将来也要毫不迟疑的运用最严格的共和国法律去对付那些反对派的机关及其领袖。他们恶意与盲目的去从事有意的鼓动，以反对政府纲领中对人民共和国都极重大的问题，尤其是关于实现国民议会所批准的两年国民经济计划的问题。同时，我必须特别强调的，我们并不反对反对派的存在。
