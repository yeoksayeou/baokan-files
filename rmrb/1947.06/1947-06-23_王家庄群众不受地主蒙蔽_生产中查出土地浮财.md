　　Wangjiazhuang Masses Not Deceived by Landlords
    Uncover Hidden Land and Wealth in Production
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The masses of Wangjiazhuang in the Second District of Ningnan, in order to completely liberate themselves, launched a pursuit battle against the landlords in production. Each group of masses hoed seedlings during the day and held meetings at night, giving the local feudal landlords Zhang Lao Yi and Wang Aide a "second round of treatment." Zhang Lao Yi and Wang Aide were landlords who had been struggled against twice last year. Because their tricks were very clever, hiding things here and there, and also asking relatives of revolutionary soldiers for intercession, crying and begging for mercy, they used these tricks to deceive the masses, so the struggle was not thorough at all. Because their economic strength was not broken, they still often engaged in activities in the village, constantly thinking of a "counter-attack." At this time, the masses aimed at the target, and completely recovered what they had buried last year, totaling: 22.89 mu of land recovered from Zhang Lao Yi (including 14 mu of wheat land), five houses, 230,000 Jicha (冀钞) currency, and many other materials. Before the struggle, the masses also thought that he was poor, and some said: "A good family fortune cannot withstand three dispersions. Even if there is something left, after being struggled against two or three times, it is already exhausted. What's the point of struggling any more?" But after the struggle and the recovery of those things, the masses said: "Even a broken boat has three thousand rotten nails!" "If you don't recognize the landlord pretending to be a big shot, if you don't see through the landlord's tricks, the struggle will not be thorough."

　　王家庄群众不受地主蒙蔽
    生产中查出土地浮财
    【本报讯】宁南二区王家庄的群众，为了彻底翻身，在生产中向地主展开追击战，各组群众，白天锄苗，夜晚开会，将本村封建地主张老一、王爱德就来了个二次回炉。按张老一、王爱德系去年被斗过两次的地主，因他们的手腕非常高，这里藏些东西，那里藏些东西，又是托抗属说情，又是哭哭啼啼求饶，用这些花样将群众的耳目蒙蔽住了，所以斗的一点也不彻底，因他的经济力量没打垮，他们在村里还时常活动，光想“反攻”。这时群众对准了目标，一家伙将去年所埋藏的东西完全追回，计：追回张老一地廿二亩八分九，（其中有麦地十四亩）房子五间，冀钞二十三万元，及其他物资甚多。在未斗争以前，群众也都认为他穷了，有的说：“好家业经不起三股撇，就算有点东西斗了两三次已经是穷了，还斗个什么劲呢？”但在斗了以后追回那些东西，群众们说：“船破还有三千烂钉呢”！“不认地主装洋蒜，不看地主鬼把戏，斗不透不了。”
