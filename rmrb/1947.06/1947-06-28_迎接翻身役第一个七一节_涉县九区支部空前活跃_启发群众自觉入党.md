	Welcoming the First "July 1st" Festival Since Liberation
		Shexian's Ninth District Branches Unprecedentedly Active
	Inspiring the Masses to Voluntarily Join the Party
	[This newspaper, Shexian News] After the Ninth District Branch-Cadre Joint Conference carried out commendation and merit evaluation, the district's branches are showing a new, lively atmosphere. The most obvious example is: After the Shangqingliang Branch cadres returned and discussed the reasons why the Party hadn't been developed in the past, the majority of comrades didn't take it seriously, feeling that joining the Party was troublesome and unwilling to cause trouble for others. After the branch leadership conducted a self-criticism, everyone unanimously agreed that more Party members meant greater strength and easier work. The branch committee members immediately took action. They enlightened the newly liberated peasants' historical consciousness by comparing the two societies, and inspired their desire to join the Party by showing them that liberation had reliance. In less than ten days, they developed five new Party members (two women) and still had five more candidates. They were determined to complete the task before "July 1st." Before the Zhongyuan branch cadre Lü Jinbao attended the joint conference, although he had resolved the conflicts with the masses and realized that as long as he worked hard and set an example, the masses would support him, he still didn't dare to boldly engage in production and didn't dare to be with the masses, fearing they would say he hadn't changed. After the branch cadres' meeting commended his merits, he developed a new style. He personally led a production brigade, organizing wheat harvesting and sowing, and promoting production in the entire village. He also educated and united poor and hired peasants in the mutual aid group. He personally developed three new Party members. Now he is even bolder and his relationship with the masses is even closer. The Zhaishang Party members requested the establishment of a branch (because the landlord component had taken control and dissolved it). They said, "Other branches are developing the Party, but we don't even have a branch, and we have no backing." Because their class consciousness had increased, they changed their dissatisfaction caused by the dissolution of the branch. After everyone's review, six alien elements were expelled and two backward elements were suspended. After the Nangang Branch conducted two historical summaries (district base point), the enthusiasm of all Party members increased. Only the branch secretary was unenthusiastic. Seeing that everyone else was enthusiastically leading the masses in production, he also joined them. In addition to leading the masses in wheat harvesting and thrift, they have now planted seven mu of land. After the Zhanao Branch discussed that they would do something big for the masses before "July 1st," the entire branch mobilized urgently. After one day of activity by Party members and discussions by mutual aid groups, with Party members taking the lead, they planted one qing of land in three days, preparing to plant corn and dig ridges. Female Party members started by mobilizing poor and hired women, mobilizing women and children to dig wild vegetables by the river (the village is in a mountain village) for five days, and then make two or three looms, preparing to organize women's production through textile work. The branch secretary participated in the sideline department, helping cooperative cadres find contract work in the city and other places, and is now making an all-out effort. In addition to leading the masses in planting, the Xiapianliang Branch also investigated the landlord's counterattack ideologically and launched a struggle. (Run Yu)

    迎接翻身役第一个七一节
　　涉县九区支部空前活跃
    启发群众自觉入党
    【本报涉县讯】九区支干联席会开展表功评功后，全区支部呈现新的活泼气象：最明显的如：上清凉支干回去讨论，过去不发展党的原因是多数同志不当回事，自己觉得参加党是麻烦，不愿叫别人也受麻烦。支部领导大家作了检讨后，大家一致认为党员发展多，力量才大，工作才好做，支部委员并马上亲自动手，他们以两个社会的对比，启发新翻身农民的历史自觉，用翻身有依靠，启发翻身农民入党的要求，不到十天即发展了五个（两个妇女）还有五个对象，“七一”前一定要完成。中原吕金保在支干开会前虽然和群众的疙瘩已解开，也摸到了只要自己好好干、起模范，群众也拥护，但总不敢大胆进行生产，不敢和群众在一块，怕群众说自己还没改样，支干开会表功后，生长了新作风，自己亲自领导一个生产大队，组织麦收下种，推动全村生产，并在互助组里教育团结贫雇。他一个人发展了三个新党员，现在他越发大胆了，和群众的关系更加密切了。寨上党员回去要求成立支部（因地主成份掌握解散了），他们说：“人家支部都要发展党，咱连个支部也没有，也没个靠墙。”由于他们阶级觉悟提高，改变因解散支部所引起的不满情绪，经大家审查，开除六个异己分子，停止两个落后分子。南岗支部经过二次历史总结（区基点），全体党员的积极性提高了，只有支书一人不干，他个人看到大家都在领导群众生产劲很大，他也跟大家干起来了。他们除领导群众麦收节约外，现已干种七亩；占凹支部经讨论“七一”前要给群众办个大事情后，全支部紧急动起来，经党员一天活动及互助组讨论、党员带头，三天内干种地一顷，准备种玉茭，要刨好圪道。女党员从发动贫雇妇女入手，动员妇女小孩到河边（本村是山庄）刨野菜五天，再做两三张机，准备从纺织上组织妇女生产；支书参加副业部，帮助合作干部到城里等地找包工活，现正全力突击中。下偏凉支部除领导群众干种外，并从思想上查出地主反攻，开展了斗争。（润玉）
