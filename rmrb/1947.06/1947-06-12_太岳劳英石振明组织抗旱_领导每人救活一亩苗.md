　　Taiyue Labor Hero Shi Zhenming Organizes Drought Resistance; Leaders Revive One Mu of Seedlings Each

　　[This Newspaper News] The Second District Office of Fushan County convened a production meeting on May 19th to launch a production merit campaign. After reviewing the achievements of spring plowing, Labor Hero Shi Zhenming, in response to the superior's call to actively support the front, prevent drought and prepare for famine, and practice production frugality, formulated the following merit plan:

　　(1) This year, the entire joint brigade (a total of five villages) should cultivate ten heroes, two from each village, one male and one female. (2) Intensify drought prevention work, personally lead the promotion of waterwheels, repair old canals, and open new canals to ensure that the five villages can irrigate 1,100 mu of land, and organize the masses on the mountains and foothills to help each other in irrigation, with each person irrigating and reviving one mu of seedlings. (3) Ensure that the entire village seizes the seedlings for autumn crops, break the masses' idea of waiting for rain, and actively prevent drought and prepare for famine. (4) This year, personally participate in mutual aid groups in each village to solve difficulties and consolidate mutual aid groups to achieve long-term mutual aid. (5) Accept past experiences, overcome the phenomenon of neglecting the organization of semi-able-bodied labor, and organize all full and semi-able-bodied labor, cripples, children, and full and semi-able-bodied livestock. (6) This year, all 49 households in his own neighborhood must achieve intensive and meticulous farming. (7) Lead the people of the entire county to support the front lines. (8) Donate his entire year's allowance as a councilor, 156 jin of millet, to the public to support the front lines. (9) Guarantee that all the land of military personnel, martyrs' families, cadres, and family members in this village is planted, with not a single mu left uncultivated. (10) Help village cadres and activists give up more of their earned fruit to fill loopholes and improve relations between the masses and cadres.

　　[This Newspaper News] Zhu Rengen, the production leader of Wanggang, Shahe, in the struggle against drought, in addition to leading the masses to carry water and plant cotton, also led his mutual aid group to save and prepare for famine. He said to everyone: "We are different now than in 1942 and 1943. At that time, we couldn't survive, so we sold our wives first, and then our children, to work for others in Nangaogou. This year, we have turned ourselves around, got land, and our wives and children have returned. I plan to make good plans for the famine year. Last year, my 15 mu of land yielded three shi of wheat. I divided the fruit and got a donkey. I ate more than one shi of wheat, and exchanged the rest for a cow. This year, I prepared early. Our group has four donkeys and two cows. The donkeys transport, the cows plow, two people drive the livestock, and seven people hoe and repair the land at home. This way we can plant our land, and earn money from transportation to buy food to get through the famine." They quickly got to work. Now, in addition to buying coal, salt, and pocket money from the money earned from transportation, they also bought five bags of grain. Zhu Gengshan said: "This year, I have already carried water and planted two mu of cotton and half a mu of melons. If it rains late, I will plant more radishes and turnips. My family of four guarantees that by the end of this year, we will still have seven bags of grain in storage. I am not afraid of the famine." Now, the enthusiasm for work is growing day by day.
