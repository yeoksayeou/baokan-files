　　【This newspaper, Jincheng News】 The masses of Beilian Village in the Second District actively find ways to resist drought, conserve resources, and get through the famine year. The Second District Production Committee issued a special notice of commendation and called on the masses of all villages to learn from the masses of Beilian Village. All village cadres in the village discussed the "Resist Drought and Conserve Resources" appeal on May 28. At the beginning, everyone thought there was no way, and individual cadres said: "It won't not rain, drought in May doesn't count as drought, good meals will be eaten in the continuous rain of June." Political Director Duan Fusheng said: "It's hard to say when it will rain, and even if it does rain later, we have to prepare now." In this way, everyone began to shift from thinking there was no way and relying on the heavens to thinking of ways. At this time, some of the masses also came to participate in the meeting. Cai Gengzi said: "As long as everyone thinks of a way, it will work. The other day, I used 20 loads of manure and 10 loads of water to plant one mu of corn, and now the seedlings have all taken root. My wife and I also discussed saving, and we saved one dou of millet in ten days. The white rice we should have eaten in the morning was changed to thin rice gruel, saving three he of rice; the noodles we should have eaten at noon were changed to soup and rice, saving four he of rice; and the mixed rice we ate at night was changed to rice soup, saving two he of rice. In these ten days, eating bran and noodles saved a total of one sheng of rice." After he finished talking, everyone had ideas. One after another, they began to discuss, and Shen Jia said: "We can't plant sorghum, we can plant corn. I planted some corn last year, mixed it with tar and bran, and scattered it on the corn ground, so that the badgers wouldn't eat it." Other methods such as Yuan Tu's suggestion to borrow soil for planting were also very good. Everyone also unanimously proposed that dogtail grass bran and grain bran should be stored to get through the famine year. After the meeting, the masses of the whole village began planting. Within seven days, they planted 58 mu of corn, and now more than 30 mu of seedlings have all come up. At the same time, they began to save rice in preparation for famine.

　　连氏村大家想办法
    继续点种储糠省米
    【本报晋城讯】二区北连氏村，群众积极想办法抗旱节约渡荒年，二区生产委员会特通报表扬，并号召各村群众向北连氏群众学习。该村全体村干于五月二十八号讨论“抗旱节约”号召，开始大家认为没有办法，还有个别干部说：“天不会不下，五月旱不算旱，六月连阴吃好饭。”政治主任段富生说：“啥时候下那很难说，就是以后会下，现在也得防备。”这样，大家就从认为没办法和靠天的思想开始转入到想办法上了。这时候有些群众也来参加会议，蔡更子说：“只要大家想办法就顶事，我在前两天用二十担粪，十担水点种了一亩玉茭，现在都捉住了苗，我和我老婆又商议节约，在十天内共省了一斗小米，早上该吃的白米饭改成糊饭，省米三合；晌午该吃面改成汤菜饭，省米四合；晚上吃的调和饭改成米汤，省米二合。在这十天内吃糠面共省米一升。”他谈罢，大家都有了门路，你一言我一语就谈开了，申甲一说：“不能种高粱，咱可点玉茭，我去年点种了些玉茭，拿柏油拌上糠，撒在玉茭地上，这样能保住獾子不吃。”其他如元土提出借土点种等办法都很好。大家又一致提出莠糠谷糠都要保存起来，以渡荒年。会后全村群众都开始了点种，七天内，点种玉茭五十八亩，现在已有三十多亩苗全上来了。同时开始省米备荒。
