    Break Through Old Traps, Promote Mass Creativity
　　Thoroughly Unleash and Vigorously and Quickly Overthrow the Four Major Landlords of Wangjia
    [Our Newspaper] The masses in Wangjia Village, Jingxing, have overthrown four major landlords, recovered the fruits of their blood and sweat, and gained initial experience. The movement is now continuing to deepen. After Wangjia was liberated, traitorous landlords immediately made arrangements in the village, saying that a village that doesn't expose itself is a good village, the Eighth Route Army will come to conscript soldiers... etc. When the movement began, the first thing was to borrow grain, and the landlords immediately spread rumors saying: If you eat one dou now, you will have to pay back one shi in the future. At the time, based on the masses' ideological concerns, the shameless rumors of the landlords were exposed. At the time, active elements were seized, and the mainstays of hired laborers, tenants, and managers were used to organize typical grievance sessions and conduct group communication and deliberation. It was proposed to arrest all nine people, including the landlords Wang Guozhi, Wang Guoyuan, Wang Guoliang, Wang Jinke, and their "running dogs," in one go. The first struggle meeting was held on May 19, with more than 200 people participating. Everyone recounted the heavy exploitation they suffered from high rents, high interest rates, and compounding interest, as well as their various crimes of evading burdens. The landlords immediately replied: "I was wrong, I was too greedy, I will return my houses and land to everyone." The one who helped the enemy to draw and grab men was pushed to the head of the big village. Many people were satisfied, and everyone lost their energy and the meeting was dismissed. The activists didn't know what to do. During the review, the leadership reminded everyone, pointing out that the landlords were retreating to advance, and the problem had not been answered. So the second and third struggle meetings were brewed. At the meeting, the former chief revealed the inside story of the traitors' past embezzlement of assigned tasks, and concentrated their crimes, questioning them one by one to the end, hitting them every time they asked a question. The masses' enthusiasm grew. An old woman cried and recounted that one of her sons was forced to become a soldier, and even the half-sheng of rice left in the house was taken away. The women angrily questioned Wang Guoliang why he beat his second wife to death. After the facts were clarified, the masses' awareness greatly improved, and they automatically organized self-defense armed guards. The movement came to an end here. A total of more than 200 mu of land, more than 40 shi of grain, more than 400 pieces of clothing, 500 silver dollars, two jin of silver, and many other items were recovered. The distribution of the fruits is now being brewed. Many experiences have been gained in the movement, the main ones being: 1. Grasp active elements and boldly mobilize the masses, give play to the creativity of the masses, unite all forces outside the object of struggle, and eliminate all ideological concerns of the masses. Give everyone a clear direction, aim at the traitors, and as long as it doesn't hit their own people, the masses can do whatever they want, there are no fixed rules, and the masses will act as chairman and sing by themselves at the general meeting. However, it is necessary to expose the traitors' conspiracies in a timely manner and support the masses, such as in the first struggle meeting, the landlords admitted their mistakes and said that they would compensate everyone with houses and land, using these soft methods to move the masses. Many people were satisfied because it was the first time in the masses' experience that the landlords had bowed their heads. At this time, the leadership should immediately expose the landlords' appeasement conspiracy, which is insincere, and cause everyone to pursue deeply and force out the truth. 2. Grasp typical grievances, use bitterness to lead to bitterness to educate the masses, and at any time and place concentrate the typical bitter water that the masses have complained about, and then clearly tell it to the masses, enlighten class consciousness, and strengthen class hatred. And run the complaint through the entire movement, without using the old trap of complaining first, then reasoning, and then settling accounts to trap the masses, allowing everyone to develop freely, and the masses will complain more and more and become more and more energetic. 3. Do a big job and do a quick job, and fight a package deal to make a pot of rice. This time, the local struggle not only combined the elimination of traitors and land reform into a package deal, but also cooked it in one pot. In complaining and reasoning, the Wangjia landlords represented by Wang Guozhi all took the stage, and the masses could complain to whoever they wanted and talk to whoever they wanted. Therefore, the power of the entire venue was used to form a vigorous momentum. This joint struggle influenced and promoted other villages. When Wangjia held a struggle meeting, they invited representatives from nearby villages to participate, which played a leading role. After the victory of the struggle in Wangjia Village, the Danjia and Wujia villages also started to work. (Jingxing Joint Office)

    冲破旧的圈套发扬群众创造
　　彻底放手大干快干王家斗倒四大地主
    【本报讯】井陉王家村群众斗倒四大地主，收回血汗果实，获得初步经验，现运动正继续深入。王家解放后，奸特地主立即在村内作了布置，说什么村不露村是好村，八路军来了要抓丁……………等，运动开始时首先进行了一借粮，地主马上就又造谣说：现在吃一斗将来还一石，还时便根据群众思想顾虑，揭穿地主的无耻造谣，向时抓住积极分子，以雇、佃、营为骨干，组织典型诉苦，进行小组串通酝酿。提出一锅煮将地主王国治、王国元、王国亮王金科等和他们的“走狗”共九人一齐扣起来。五月十九日开第一次斗争大会，参加群众二百多人，大家纷纷诉说被他们高租高利、利上加利的重重剥削，和他们逃避负担的种种罪过，地主们当即回答说：“我错了，我利心大，拿我的房地还大家”。对帮敌人抽了抓夫＠推到大乡头上。不少群众认为满意，大家没了劲头散了会。积极分子不知该怎样干法。在检讨时领导上提醒大家，指出地主们是以退为进，问题并没有答复。于是又酝酿起第二次、第三次斗争大会，在大会上通过旧甲长揭露了奸霸们过去贪污分赋的内幕，并把他们的罪恶集中起来，一宗一宗的追问到底、追一顿打一顿，群众劲头大起来了。有个老太婆大哭着诉说她一个儿子被逼去当兵，家里剩半升米也给倒走。妇女们气愤的追问王国良为啥打死他二房老婆。事情摆明后，群众觉悟大大提高一步，自动组织自卫武装看差站岗，运动至此告一段落。计收回土地二百余亩，粮食四十余石、衣服四○○多件、银元五百元、白银二斤及其他物品甚多，现正酝酿分果实。运动中获得不少经验，主要的有：一、抓紧积极分子大胆放手发动群众，发挥群众的创造性，团结斗争对象以外的一切力量，取消群众思想上的一切顾虑。给大家明确方向、对准奸霸，只要不打到自己人身上，群众随便干，没有死规矩，开大会群众自当主席自打自唱。但须及时揭露奸霸阴谋，给群众撑腰作主，如在第一次斗争会中地主口口声声承认错误，并说把房地赔偿大家，以这些软办法感动群众，不少群众认为满意，因为在群众的经验里，地主低头还是第一次。这时领导上应立即揭破地主的软化阴谋，口服心不服，引起大家深追逼出原形。二、抓住典型诉苦，以苦引苦教育群众，随时随地把群众诉出的典型苦水集中起来，再明确的讲给群众听，启发阶级觉悟，加强阶级仇恨。并以诉苦贯穿整个运动，不用先诉苦后讲理再清算的旧圈套套群众，让大家自由发展，群众便越诉越会诉，劲头也越大。三、大干快干一揽子斗争做一锅饭。这次土家斗争不但除奸、土地改革结合一揽子搞、一锅煮。在诉苦、讲理中，以王国治为代表的王家地主一齐上场，群众愿对谁诉就对谁诉，愿对谁讲就对谁讲。因此运用了整个会场的力量，形成轰轰烈烈的气势。这儿联合斗争，影响推动他村，王家开斗争会时，邀请附近村里代表参加，起了不少带头作用，王家村斗争胜利后，单家、吴家＠就也搞起来了。  （井陉联合办公室）
