Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: Thirty million people here are currently armed to the teeth, sharpening sickles and threshing floors, preparing to launch a victorious summer harvest amidst the tense war environment. The army and civilians in the border areas and areas behind Chiang have already carried out combat mobilization and thrown themselves into the summer harvest. Gao Yuncheng and Jin Weisan, explosion and shooting heroes from Luzhong, have led explosion guerrilla teams with American-made machine guns and a large number of landmines to the Chiang-occupied areas of counties where summer wheat ripens early, besieging and harassing the Chiang troops to protect the rushed harvest. The 300-li border line of the Yishan District has begun to rectify and organize militia joint defense. Local armed forces and explosion guerrillas in various sub-districts are prepared to fight and harvest at the same time. Organs and schools in various places have decided that, in addition to retaining necessary staff, they will all take leave to participate in the summer harvest in their stationed areas and help the masses transport goods with all livestock during the wheat harvest. Women in Nanbu Village, Yiyuan, after hoeing 200 mu of spring seedlings, specially changed the women's helping-farming team to a helping-harvesting team to assist military dependents and the dependents of soldiers in harvesting and storing. Xiaofang and Qianzhuang in Hongshan District, Junan, have established wheat harvesting inspection teams, with each team formulating wheat harvesting merit regulations. Gou Tou and other districts in Ju County have established a wheat harvesting joint defense to help each other rush the harvest. Hejiadian has begun to harvest barley. The whole village has agreed to cook at night and harvest during the day, with the militia scouting and village cadres taking turns on duty. In the event of an enemy invasion, they will move in groups.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 4th: Since late May, various parts of Jiaodong have received rain one after another. On the 28th, the rainfall in Laiyang, Qixia, and other places was as deep as two plows. A bumper wheat harvest is already assured. According to old farmers' estimates, even fifth and sixth grade land in the mountainous areas can harvest two dou (50 jin per dou) of wheat per mu. Both military grain and civilian food are free from worry.
