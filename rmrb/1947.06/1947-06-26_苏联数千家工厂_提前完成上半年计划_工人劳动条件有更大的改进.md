　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st -- TASS Moscow dispatch: Soviet industrial workers have victoriously realized their guarantee. Thousands of factories and manufacturing plants have completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule, including 500 in Moscow, more than 100 in Leningrad, and industries in Riga, the capital of the Latvian Republic. Riga's production volume has increased by 50% compared to the first half of 1946, especially in the production of consumer goods and mineral fertilizers, as well as radio equipment, telephone equipment, etc. Kreigorholm, the largest textile factory in Estonia, has already completed its half-year production plan ahead of schedule. Hundreds of factories and other enterprises in Georgia, Armenia, Ukraine, and other Soviet republics have achieved similar success. Groups of workers in many major industries in the Russian Federation have decided to celebrate the first meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, to be held on June 26, with new victories on the production front. This movement was first initiated by the worker group led by Lokiyanov of the Kirov Textile Factory, who guaranteed to overproduce 37.5 tons of thread this year. The oil miners of Bashkir also guaranteed to complete the drilling of deep oil wells before June 20.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th -- TASS Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Factory Committee and management departments signed a joint contract for 1947, stipulating an appropriation of 81.2 million rubles (50% more than last year) for labor safety measures. Approximately 100 million rubles have been allocated to improve the labor conditions of railway workers, 75 million to the eastern coal mining industry, and 83 million rubles to the iron and non-ferrous metal industries. The restoration of the national economy and good labor safety equipment throughout the Soviet Union has produced good results: accidents in many industries have decreased more than fourfold in the past fifteen years. The post-war reconstruction of industry has brought even greater improvements in labor conditions. At the suggestion of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the government abolished overtime work implemented during the war, restored the vacation system for workers and government employees, and formulated a series of regulations to protect female workers and young workers. The Central Council of Trade Unions has established a scientific committee to improve labor conditions in factories, and nearly 30 research institutes and laboratories are engaged in designing labor safety measures.

　　苏联数千家工厂
    提前完成上半年计划
    工人劳动条件有更大的改进
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联工业工人已胜利地实现了他们的保证。数千家工厂及制造厂已提前完成上半年的生产计划，内中包括莫斯科的五百家，列宁格勒的百余家及拉脱维亚共和国首都里加的工业。里加生产量较一九四六年上半年增加达百分之五十，特别是消费物品和矿物肥料的出产及无线电机器、电话机设备等。爱沙尼亚最大纺织厂克锐哥尔姆已经提前完成其半年生产计划。在乔治亚、亚美尼亚、乌克兰以及其他苏维埃共和国数百工厂和其他企业都有同样的成就。俄罗斯联邦许多主要工业中的成群工人决定以生产阵线上的新胜利来庆祝六月廿六日召开的俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃第一次会议。这一运动首先由基洛夫纺织厂洛基雅诺夫所领导的工人小组所发起，他保证今年超过计划生产三十七。五吨线。巴什基尔的油矿工人亦保证在六月二十日前完成深油井的开凿。
    【新华社陕北二十四日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联工厂委员会与管理部门签订一九四七年共同契约，规定拨款八万一千二百万卢布（较去年多百分之五十）作为劳工安全措施之用。约一万万卢布已指拨作为改进铁路工人之劳动条件，七千五百万指拨给东部煤矿工业，八千三百万卢布指拨给铁与非铁金属工业。全苏国民经济复员与良好的劳工安全设备已产生了很好的结果：许多工业中意外事件在过去十五年中减少四倍多。战后工业之重建在劳动条件上有更大的改进。根据苏维埃职工联盟中央委员会的提议，政府废除了实施于战时的超过时间的工作，恢复了工人及政府雇员休假制，并制定一系列保护女工和青工的法规。职工联盟中央委员会设立科学委员会，以改进工厂的劳动条件，差不多有三十个研究会同实验室正在从事设计劳工安全措施。
