　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. The anti-labor bill proposed to Congress by notorious reactionary Republican legislators such as Taft has aroused widespread opposition from American workers and public opinion. According to a Washington dispatch: Following the successive demonstrations in New York by 50,000 members of the American Federation of Labor and 60,000 members of the Congress of Industrial Organizations against the anti-labor bill of Taft et al., 1,000 worker representatives from various parts of the United States gathered in Washington on the 19th and marched in a procession to the front of the Republican Party headquarters to protest this anti-labor bill. Letters and telegrams from various places demanding that Truman reject the bill poured into the White House like snowflakes. A thousand daily newspapers also echoed the calls, supporting the workers' demands.

　　美国工人及舆论反对反劳工法案
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】美著名反动派共和党议员塔虎脱等向国会所提之反劳工法案，已激起美国工人及舆论之普遍反对。据华盛顿讯：继劳工联合会五万会员与产业工会联合会六万会员于纽约相继举行反对塔虎脱等之反劳工法案游行示威后，美国各地工人代表一千人又于十九日集于华府列队游行，并至共和党总办公处前，抗议此一反劳工法案。各地要求杜鲁门拒绝认可该法案之函电，有如雪汽飞至白宫。一千家日报亦同声呼吁，支持工人之要求。
