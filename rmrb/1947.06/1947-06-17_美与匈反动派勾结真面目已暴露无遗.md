　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Comprehensive reports state that Hungarian newspapers have revealed the fact that US imperialism secretly supports Hungarian reactionaries. In January of this year, Nagy sent his son to Washington with a letter to former US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson, requesting that the Truman Doctrine be applied to Hungary and that special assistance be provided. Acheson immediately replied, agreeing. The US State Department denied this matter, but this clumsy denial only proves the fact that Acheson's reply, dated March 3rd, was just a few days before Truman's clamorous expansion under the pretext of resisting communism. The letter also "mentioned the relationship between the US and Hungary after the war." At the same time, the US is now taking a so-called "compassionate attitude" to protect some of the traitors in the Hungarian Embassy in the United States. Its face of colluding with Hungarian reactionaries has been fully exposed.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS, London: According to a news article by David Raymond, the International Editor of the Reynolds newspaper, he wrote in his essay on the reactions of England and the US on the Hungarian incidents: "The United States has suspended the credit loans to Hungary; therefore, it is acting under the spirit of the policy that finances are only given to anti-communist governments" (Note: Actually, it is a reactionary government that accepts the expansion of US imperialism and sells out national independence and the people's democratic freedom). "Now the truth of the incidents in Hungary and Italy has been fully revealed. We must use this to judge Marshall's proposal to give financial assistance to Western European countries, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Assuming that its purpose is to expand Truman's policies towards Greece and Turkey to most of Europe, it can only lead to tense war cries between the East and the West."

　　美与匈反动派勾结真面目已暴露无遗
    【新华社陕北十四日电】综合报导：据匈牙利报纸揭露美帝国主义秘密支持匈反动派的事实称：今年一月间奈基曾遣派其子往华盛顿送致美前副国务卿亚泽逊一函。请求将杜鲁门政策应用于匈牙利，予以特别援助，亚泽逊当即函复允诺。美国务院对此事加以否认，但该项藏头露尾之否认反而证明此一事实，即亚泽逊之复函日期三月三日恰在杜鲁门借口抵制共产主义叫嚣扩张之前数日，函中并“述及战后美匈两国之关系。”同时，美国现对匈驻美公使馆中之一部分叛国分子，竟先明采取所谓“慈悲态度”，予以保护。其勾结匈反动派之面目，已暴露无遗。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社伦敦讯：雷诺新闻国际编辑大卫·雷蒙德顷在其论述英美对匈牙利事变之反应的论文中写道：“美国中止了对匈牙利的信用贷款，因此它是本着这样政策的精神而行动，这种政策即是金元只给予反共产党的政府”（按：实际上是接受美帝国主义扩张，出卖国家独立及人民民主自由的反动派政府）。“现在在匈牙利与意大利所发生的事变均已真象大白，我们必须用来判断马歇尔给予西欧诸国及波兰与捷克以金元援助之建议，假设其目的在于扩张杜鲁门的对希土政策至大部欧洲，则它只能引致东西之间的紧张的战争嚣嚷。”
