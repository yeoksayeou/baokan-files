　　Jiji Military Region Political Department Instructions
    The Entire Army Participates in Land Reform
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Jinchaji Daily published prominently on the 22nd of last month: The Jiji Military Region Political Department's instructions for the entire army to participate in the land reform and re-examination. The instructions call on the entire army, regardless of front or rear, base area or marginal area, cadres or soldiers, to participate in the land reform and re-examination movement without exception. All units should do a good job of re-examining in the villages where they are stationed. The front-line troops should fight while mobilizing the masses. The instructions emphasized: "Comrades from poor peasant and farm laborer backgrounds should write letters encouraging their families to bravely struggle against landlords; comrades from middle peasant backgrounds should explain to their families that they should stand with the peasants to struggle against landlords; comrades from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds should mobilize their families to accept the peasants' just demands. Those who resolutely defend the interests of the landlords and are of two minds should be purged from the Party. During the land reform, political organs at all levels should prohibit submitting requests to the government to take care of the liquidated military dependents, and even more should not be allowed to go home to interfere with the land reform. If anyone is found writing letters in their own name or leaving their posts without authorization to go home to threaten the government to resolve personal issues, they should be given disciplinary punishment. All land rented by troops from landlords should be handed over to the peasants, and they should not compete with the people for profit." It also stated: "The guns belong to the peasants, the army is the people's army, it is the army of land reform, and helping the peasants defeat 'Little Chiang Kai-shek' (i.e., the landlords) is the most important task of the entire army at present."

　　冀晋军区政治部指示
    全军参加土地改革
    【本报讯】晋察冀日报上月二十二日以显著地位刊载：冀晋军区政治部全军参加土地改革与复查的指示，该指示号召全军不分前方后方、根据地与边缘区、干部与战士都毫无例外的参加土地改革与复查运动。各单位作好驻村复查，前方军队要一面打仗，一面发动群众。该指示强调指出：“贫雇农出身的同志，去信鼓励家中大胆向地主斗争；出身中农的同志，给家中解释和农民站在一起向地主斗争；地主、富农出身的同志，应动员家中接受农民正义要求。对坚决维护地主利益的两条心分子，应清算出党。土地改革中各级政治机关，应禁止函呈政府照顾被清算军属，更不准许回家干涉土地改革。如发现以个人名义写信或擅离岗位回家威胁政府解决个人问题者，应给以纪律处分。凡部队租种地主之地，一律交给农民，不能与民争利。”并提出：“枪是农民的枪，军队是人民的子弟兵，是土地改革的军队，帮助农民打垮‘小蒋介石’（即地主）是全军当前的重要任务。”
