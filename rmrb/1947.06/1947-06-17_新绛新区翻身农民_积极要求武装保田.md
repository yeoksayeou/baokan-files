    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] In the newly liberated area of Xinjiang, land reform is being carried out unreservedly, and the movement is swift and fierce. In the first district, 41 villages including Nanzhuang initially completed land distribution before the wheat harvest. The second, sixth, and seventh districts broke through four key points including Wan'an and Zhai Li, enabling the movement to develop from points to a surface. The first district developed 20,000 peasant association members in 20 days, becoming the backbone of the movement. Cadres detained landlords and bullies according to the demands of the masses, suppressing the arrogance of the landlords and boosting the fighting spirit of the peasants. After the masses obtained land, they actively demanded armed protection of the land, and enlightened peasants competed to join the militia. Currently, the county's Land Reform Committee is organizing all new forces to invest in the second and sixth districts to continue the assault.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 13th dispatch] In Jiao Xiaoyao Village, Jiang County New District, land reform was quickly brewed after the county seat was recovered. Peasants complained and settled accounts with landlords, bullies, and usurers. In five days, 162.5 mu of land, 15 cave dwellings, 9 houses, and a lot of grain and livestock were recovered. After planned distribution, 75 of the 86 households in the village received fruits. Farmers with little or no land have received enough arable land and production capital. On the 26th of last month, all the farmers in the village gathered to celebrate "Land Returned to Home", and reorganized the organization and armed themselves to protect the land.

　　新绛新区翻身农民
    积极要求武装保田
    【本报太岳十三日电】新绛新解放区放手进行土地改革，运动迅速猛烈。一区南庄等四十一村，在麦收前初步完成分田，二、六、七区等突破万安、寨里等四个基点，使运动由点发展到面。一区在二十天中发展了两万个农会会员，成为开展运动的骨干。干部根据群众要求，把地主恶霸扣押起来。压倒地主的气焰，助长了农民的斗争情绪。群众分得土地后，积极要求武装保田，觉悟农民争相参加民兵。现该县土地改革委员会正组织一切新的力量投入二、六两区，继续突击。
    【本报太岳十三日电】绛县新区焦小窑村，在县城收复后，迅速酝酿土地改革，农民向地主、恶霸、高利贷者诉苦清算，经五天时间，收回土地一百六十二亩半、窑洞十五孔、房屋九间、及不少粮食耕畜。经过有计划的分配，全村八十六户，有七十五户得到果实，少地与无地农民都已得到足够的耕地和生产资本。上月二十六日，全村农民集会庆祝“土地还家”，并整顿组织，武装起来保田。
