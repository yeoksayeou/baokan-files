　　Promote Production and Get Rich Demands
    Successfully Eliminate Drought Obstacles
    Licheng Summarizes Drought Resistance and Sowing Experience
    [This newspaper, Licheng News] Licheng has summarized its experience in resisting drought and sowing seeds. The county, starting from promoting the enthusiasm of liberated peasants to demand production, overcame various obstacles and successfully completed sowing. Its main experiences are as follows:

    1. Promote the masses' demands to get rich through production and guide them towards conscious drought-resistant production. Experience has proven that when the masses' thinking of getting rich is promoted, positive factors for struggle can be established, negative thoughts and emotions can be quickly overcome (promoting righteousness itself carries the factor of overcoming negative emotions), the movement can be rapidly launched, and a large number of production activists will emerge in large numbers. The method is to start with the centralized mobilization of heroic cadres and activists, then go deep into mutual aid organizations to mobilize the masses separately, and propose during the mobilization: "What should we do if the land is dry due to drought? Is it right to sit and wait for rain? Is it right to carry water and plant seeds?" Because the masses have established the thinking of getting rich, and the question is raised from a positive perspective, the correct opinions and slogans of the masses will naturally be put forward, such as: "Plant early and eat your fill, plant late and break your bowl." "If you see seedlings, you'll get 30% of the harvest, if you plant late, you'll lose the seeds..." The leadership will concentrate the correct opinions of the masses and propose: "We can't wait for rain to plant, we can't rely on the sky to eat." "Mobilize urgently, carry water and plant seeds." "Sow quickly when the weather is dry, waiting will lead to starvation." "We have the strength to eliminate feudalism, and we have even more strength to overcome the spring drought." These action slogans will be enthusiastically responded to by the masses. On the basis of this drought-resistant production consciousness of the masses, we further organize the masses to start from calculations, organize auxiliary labor to participate in production, and the difficulty of lack of labor is solved. The drought-resistant sowing movement is thus rapidly and enthusiastically launched on this basis. However, in individual places, because the cadres one-sidedly adopted the negative aspects of the masses' thinking, overestimated the difficulties, and ignored the positive fighting emotions in the masses' thinking, they tangled around in solving these one-sided negative thoughts, resulting in great effort but little effect.

    2. From the perspective of the movement, heroes taking the lead and combining ideological solutions with practical actions has had great results. Although the masses in Baiguan Village recognized that they should sow quickly in the event of drought, some waiting-for-the-season thoughts were at play. Labor hero Mo Guisheng said: "As long as the technology is good, planting a few days earlier will not be bad. One step ahead, always ahead. A clumsy bird should fly early, and our village should run ahead since we lack labor." While organizing the masses to discuss, he led his group to plant first, and then came back at night to mobilize, promoting the whole village. As a result, the sowing movement in the whole village was quickly launched. After labor hero Liu Entang in Xibayu organized his group to discuss and overcome the thinking of waiting for rain, he immediately organized all the labor in his group (ten strong young and old, five women and eight) to plant cotton in the fields, except for four who were weaving cloth. According to the strength of the labor, they were divided into plowing the land, carrying water, digging ditches, and dropping seeds. They planted 20 mu of cotton in three days. Due to the influence of his practice and the results of his actual organization, the whole village acted universally, planting 1,023 mu of cotton in all the base areas within three days.

    3. The Technical Committee should be closely integrated with the masses' production activities: After the drought-resistant sowing, the Nan Village Technical Committee immediately researched a complete set of technologies from plowing to sowing, and quickly promoted it throughout the village. Such a Technical Committee truly played a guiding role in agricultural production. This means that the Technical Committee is not only a research organization, but also a promotion organization, not only researching itself, but also combining it with experiments.

    4. After the successful completion of drought-resistant sowing, propose according to the needs of the masses: "Prepare for a long-term drought resistance struggle, save and prepare for famine." After Yuanquan finished sowing, labor hero Guo Changqun organized the masses to discuss: What if the drought continues? Everyone unanimously agreed to build irrigation canals, preparing to use five days of work to build a canal that could irrigate 42 mu of land. Under the leadership of Hu Lao, Zhao Gu used 62 workdays to open a three-li long canal, which could irrigate 150 mu of land. Now 80 mu of land has been watered. After sowing was completed in water-scarce places such as Yanweifenjun, according to the requirements of the masses, water pools and wells were being dug. Beiliu proposed the slogan: "Don't forget winter clothes in hot weather, every family should store grain to prepare for famine," advocating thrift and launching a "handful of rice" movement. Labor heroes Wang Jucai, He Kaoxian, Yang Shuanhao, etc. have all formulated savings plans and promoted them to the whole team and the whole village. (Yang Ke)

　　发扬生产发家要求
    胜利排除抗旱障碍
    黎城总结抗旱下种经验
    【本报黎城讯】黎城总结抗旱下种经验。该县从发扬翻身农民积极要求生产的热情出发，克服了各种障碍，胜利完成下种，其主要经验如下：
    一、发扬群众发家致富要求，引导群众走向抗旱生产自觉。经验证明：当群众的发家致富思想被发扬之后，积极斗争的因素便能树立，消极的思想情绪便能很快克服，（发扬正气本身就带有克服消极情绪因素）运动也就能迅速的开展，大批生产积极分子也就会大量的涌现出来。方式上是从集中动员英雄干部积极分子入手，再深入到互助组织中分头动员群众，在动员中提出：“天旱地干种地该怎办？坐着等雨对呢？担水栽种对呢？”由于群众树立了发家思想，问题又是从积极方面提出的，因此讨论中正确的意见口号群众自然就会提了出来，如：“早种吃饱饭，迟种摔了碗。”“见苗三分收，迟种把籽丢…………。”领导上将群众这种正确意见集中起来，提出：“该种地不能等雨，要吃饭不能靠天。”“紧急动员起来，担水栽种。”“天旱下种快动手，等待就要饿肚皮。”“我们有力量消灭封建，就更有力量战胜春旱。”等行动口号，就会得到群众的热烈响应。在群众这种抗旱生产自觉的基础上，更进一步组织群众从计算出发，组织辅助劳力参加生产，劳力缺乏的困难也就得到了解决。抗旱下种运动也就在这样基础上迅速而热烈的开展起来。但在个别地方，由于干部片面采取群众思想上的消极面，过高估计困难，忽视群众思想上的积极斗争情绪，在解决这些片面的消极思想上缠来缠去，结果是出力大而收效少。
    二、从运动中看，英雄带头，解决思想与实际行动结合，收效很大。柏官庄群众虽认识到天旱应快下种，但有些等节令思想在作怪，劳动英雄莫贵生说：“只要技术好，早种几天也坏不了。一步在前，步步在前，笨鸟应先飞，咱村劳力缺就应往前跑。”他一面组织群众讨论，一面就领导自己小组先种，黑夜回来再行动员，推动全村，于是全村下种运动很快开展起来。西柏峪劳动英雄刘恩堂组织他组讨论克服了等雨思想后，第二天马上组织全组劳力（精壮十个老少五个妇女八个）除四个织布外，全部到地栽花。根据劳力强弱分头耕地、担水、刨圪道、跌籽等，三天栽花二十亩，由于他的实践影响与实际组织的结果，全村普遍行动起来，三天内全基点栽花一千零二十三亩。
    三、技术委员会应与群众的生产活动紧密结合：抗旱下种后，南村技委会马上研究出由耕地到下种一套完整技术，很快在全村就推行开了。这样的技委会真正作到对农业生产的指导作用。这就是说：技委会不仅是个研究组织，而且是个推广组织，不仅自己研究，还须结合实验。
    四、抗旱下种胜利完成后，根据群众要求提出：“准备长期抗旱斗争，节约备荒。”元泉下完种后，劳动英雄郭长群组织群众讨论：天要旱下去怎办？大家一致同意修水渠，准备用五天工夫拿一百四十个工修一条水渠，可浇四十二亩地，赵姑在胡老开领导下用了六十二个工开了一条三里长水渠，能浇一百五十亩地，现在有八十亩地已上了水，岩井坟峻等缺水地方下种一结束，根据群众要求都在挖水池掏水井，北流提出：“热天不忘寒衣裳，家家积存备荒粮。”口号提倡节省俭用，开展一把米运动。劳动英雄王聚才何考贤杨拴好等均订出节约计划，并推广到全队与全村。（杨柯）
