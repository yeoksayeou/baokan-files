[This article was transmitted by this newspaper from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 10th.] In the newly recovered areas of Yanjin County, a fervent revenge and recalculation movement is underway. During the county's occupation, landlords were rampant, coercing the reversal of grain and land ownership, and oppressing and even killing revolutionary family members and activists. After our army recovered the county, the masses strongly demanded retribution. However, the area is located on the border between the Pinghan and Longhai railways, facing the enemy on three sides. The despotic landlords are still secretly colluding with stubborn and puppet forces, constantly invading and disrupting, and the masses still dare not raise their heads. Our democratic government resolutely supports the masses, organizing military-accompanying work teams to work village by village. In each village, mass meetings are held to publicize the decrees of the democratic government, express our attitude, and dispel the masses' concerns. Bad landlords and special agents are detained and given due punishment: murderers pay with their lives, and those who reversed grain ownership must return the grain. When the work team arrived at Yue Village in the Sixth District, a mass meeting was held. After the arrest of the bad landlord Hu Jintang on the spot, many landlords who had reversed land and grain ownership immediately brought grain to the peasants' homes to return it and apologize, and swore in front of the peasants, begging them to accept the grain and promising not to do bad things again. The peasants still voluntarily set up sentry posts and continued the movement. When the work team entered Li Pizhai Village, the masses immediately became enthusiastic, distributing grain and wealth. When investigating the hidden wealth of landlord Hu Xingrang, men, women, old, and young in the whole village rushed to the front, crowding the place. A sixty-year-old man said, "As long as the government stands up for us, we dare to die, it's better than starving anyway." In twenty-five days, twenty-seven villages have launched revenge and recalculation campaigns to clear out hidden wealth. On average, the peasants in each village have recovered no less than forty dan of grain.

　　组织随军工作组走一村做一村
    延津到处复仇反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】延津收复区热烈开展复仇反倒算运动，该县沦陷期间地主曾横行霸道倒粮倒地，并欺压残杀我革命家属与积极分子，我军收复该县后群众强烈要求复仇，但该地处于平汉陇海两路边线，三面临敌，恶霸地主尚暗中勾搭顽伪，不断侵袭扰乱，群众仍不敢抬头，我民主政府坚决给群众撑腰，组织随军工作组，走一村作一村，每到一村召开群众大会，宣传民主政府法令，表明态度，解除群众顾虑，并将坏蛋地主特务扣押，予以应得之惩罚，杀人者抵命，倒粮者还粮。工作组随军到六区岳村时，召开群众大会，当场逮捕坏蛋地主胡金堂后，许多倒地倒粮地主当即自动提着粮食，到农民家里还粮赔不是，并在农民面前宣誓，哀求收下粮食，保证以后不做坏事。农民仍自动设放岗哨，继续进行。工作组进到李皮寨村时，群众即热烈起来分粮分财，在清查地主胡兴让的浮财时，全村男女老少争先前去，挤得水泄不通，一个六十岁的老头说：“只要政府给俺做主，死也敢要，横竖总比挨饿强”。二十五天中已有二十七个村展开复仇反倒算清理浮财运动，平均每村农民收回之粮食不下四十石。
