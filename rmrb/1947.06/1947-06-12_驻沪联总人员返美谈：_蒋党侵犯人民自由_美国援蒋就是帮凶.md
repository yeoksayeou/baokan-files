Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: TASS, New York: According to afternoon newspapers here, Douglas Falconer, a UNRRA staff member who recently returned to the United States from China, stated at a meeting of the China Aid Committee in New York that the Chinese Kuomintang suppresses all freedoms. He said that further US aid to China would violate the interests of the Chinese people and the principles of freedom and democracy. He declared that people's freedom does not exist in China today. During his stay in Shanghai, 3,200 people disappeared without trial or formal accusation. Mr. Falconer went on to say that the Kuomintang air force, composed of American aircraft, American-trained aviators, and American munitions, mainly bombs and strafes Chinese civilians. This action has aroused deep resentment towards the United States among the Chinese people, who believe that the Kuomintang air force is the American air force.

    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社纽约讯：此间下午报载：最近自中国返美之联总工作人员都格拉斯·范尔柯纳，在纽约援华委员会会议上陈述中国国民党压制一切的自由。他说：美国再行援华将违犯中国人民的利益和自由民主的原则。他宣称：人民自由在今天的中国是不存在的，在他留住上海期间，曾有三千二百人失踪，既没有经过审讯，也没有经过正式的控诉。范尔氏继称：由美国飞机，美国训练的航空员和美国军火组成之国民党空军主要的是轰炸及扫射中国平民，这种行动已经在中国人民中激起对于美国的深刻的愤慨，他们认为国民党的空军就是美国空军。
