Hoes Have Water, the More You Hoe, the More Beautiful
    Lucheng Fourth District Launches Hoeing and Drought Resistance Campaign
    [Our Newspaper, Lucheng Dispatch] The Lucheng Fourth District convened a meeting of various heroes, model workers, and skilled individuals on the eighth of this month. It summarized the sowing, selected models, and launched a hoeing and drought resistance campaign. Two hundred and seventeen people, through discussions in small groups and large groups, "compared merits, compared achievements, and discussed experiences," unanimously agreed that this year there is a general lack of labor. The ability to quickly and victoriously complete the rush sowing early on is due to Chairman Mao's call to organize. Otherwise, it would not have been so rapid and timely. As Li Haoqiu, a liberated hero from Guzhang, said: "My village has more than seventy hectares of land, and five mu of garden land is very time-consuming. There are more than 400 full and half laborers and about seventy livestock. When we organized mutual aid, everyone thought it wouldn't work this year. I went to the front to comfort the troops and was still worried about production in the rear. When I came back and looked, everything had been sown, and sown very well. I led the masses to build a four-li long canal in a day and a half, installed two waterwheels, and fought against the drought. The people all said: 'Thanks to Chairman Mao's call for organization, the organization method is good. Otherwise, the land this year really couldn't have been sown, let alone building canals and installing waterwheels.'" Another example is Han Tingzhao from Zaozhen, who said: "Seeing the lack of labor and the need to transport grain, I came up with a large-scale exchange labor method, organizing all the women, children, and old men in the village to carry out a ten-day assault, and all the grain fields were sown." After such discussions, everyone's morale was very high. On this basis, after small group discussions, the conference selected model cadre Li Haoqiu, model military family member Shao Renchen, model mutual aid group Zhou Laiyun, labor hero Guo Bacheng, and model grain transporter and honorably discharged soldiers, totaling seventeen people. Immediately afterwards, they discussed the work of hoeing seedlings, resisting drought, and preparing for famine. Each village set out a plan to ensure that no labor was wasted and to combine agricultural and sideline production to increase income. For example, Zhang Cunfang, the political director of Ke Village, said: "Our village has already hoed half of the millet, and we guarantee to complete it all in five days." Then Li Sanfen from Xiwang said: "Our village has also hoed three hectares, and we can complete it in five days as well." Han Manying, a model cadre from Changzhuang, calculated precisely and said: "Our village guarantees to completely hoe all the autumn land in twenty-five days, leaving no land uncultivated." The slogans are: "Hoe millet and apply fertilizer to the top, the more you hoe, the more energetic you are," "Hoes have hectares, resist drought and prepare for famine," "Hoes have water, the more you hoe, the more beautiful," "A trickle of water flows continuously, and there is no need to worry about famine." They broke the masses' backward, paralyzed, and superstitious sayings: "Mice jumping all over the house means a good harvest, wolves and tigers go up the mountain, there will be good fields," and they all recognized that only by organizing can they overcome natural disasters. After selecting various models, the district headquarters issued a list of merits, credited the elected models with a major merit, and gave them pennants and material rewards. San Gao compiled the heroic deeds of each model into a Yangko opera to congratulate and encourage the models. In the end, everyone said with emotion: "It's really glorious to make contributions. We weren't selected this time, but we'll catch up next time." The elected said: "Don't be arrogant or conceited, go back and take the lead, and add more effort on top of the merits."

    [Our Newspaper, Licheng Dispatch] Wang Tonghui, a labor hero from Yantouling in the Sixth District, saw that it was dry and not raining, and the small seedlings that grew were blown to death by the wind. If they were not quickly weeded out, the small seedlings would suffer even greater losses. Moreover, the millet seedlings were already four or five inches tall, and if a heavy rain fell and squeezed together with the wheat harvest, the small seedlings would definitely be ruined. He discussed with the captain to first weed for the military families, and then the entire team exchanged labor with each other to assault weeding the millet. Currently, more than twenty mu have been weeded in three days. Under the influence of his team, the entire village, within five days, after deducting those participating in the war and supporting the front, a total of forty full and half male laborers weeded more than 1,640 mu. The millet of all seventeen military families in the village has been completely weeded. The entire village also extracted seventeen laborers to drive livestock and engage in transportation, earning 358,500 yuan in twenty days. (Yantouling Correspondence Group)

　　锄头有水越锄越美
    潞城四区开展锄苗抗旱运动
    【本报潞城讯】潞城四区本月八号召开各种英雄、模范能手会议，总结下种，评选模范，开展锄苗抗旱运动，二百一十七人经小组会、大组会“比功劳比成绩谈经验”的讨论，一致认为今年劳力普遍缺乏，能很快胜利的及早完成抢垧下种，这要不是毛主席号召组织起来，那有这样迅速与及时，如故漳翻身英雄李好秋说：“我村有七十多顷地，有园地五亩非常误工，全半劳力有四百来人，牲口七十来头，组织互助时大家都觉得今年不行。我到前方劳军，在前线还耽心后方生产，回来时看了看也是全部种下，并且还种的很好。我就领导群众一天半修成了四里地长水渠一道，按水车两辆，向旱灾作斗争，老百姓都说：亏毛主席号召对，组织办法好，要不是今年的地可是真种不上，不要说还要修水渠，按水车。”又如枣臻韩庭照说：“我见劳力缺乏，又要运粮，就想了个大变工办法，把全村妇女、儿童、老汉全部组织起来，突击了十天，所有谷地全部下种。”经过这样的讨论，大家情绪很高，在这个基础上，经过小组讨论，大会评选出模范干部李好秋，模范军属邵仁辰，模范互助组周来云，劳动英雄郭八成，模范运粮、荣退军人等共十七名。遂即讨论锄苗抗旱备荒工作，各村都订出计划，保证不浪费一个劳力，做到农副业结合增加收入。如渴村政治主任张存芳说：“我村现已锄谷一半，五天保证全部完成。”接着西旺李三粪说：“我村也锄了三顷，五天也能完成。”常庄模范干部韩满英用精确计算的方式算出来说：“我村廿五天保证将秋地完全锄完，不荒一亩地。”口号是：“谷锄寸顶上粪，越锄越有劲”，“锄头有垧，抗旱备荒”，“锄头有水，越锄越美”，“细水长流，渡荒不发愁。”打破了群众落后麻痹的迷信说法：“老鼠满家蹦，定是好收成，狼虎上了山，定要好收田”，都认识了只有组织起来才能战胜天灾。选出各种模范后，区指挥部出了功劳榜，给当选模范记大功一次，并给以锦旗与物质奖品，三高把各模范的英雄事迹编成秧歌剧，给各模范贺功助兴。最后大家感动的说：“立下功真光荣，咱这次没选上，下回咱赶上”，当选者说：“不自高不自大，回去起带头，功上再加油。”（保福、安忠、景先）
