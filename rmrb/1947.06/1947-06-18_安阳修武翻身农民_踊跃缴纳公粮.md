　　Anyang and Xiuwu Turned-Over Peasants
    Eagerly Hand Over Public Grain
    [Report from our Anyang Office] After the wheat harvest, the masses in Anyang County enthusiastically stored "counter-offensive grain." Especially the masses in the newly recovered areas and the re-recovered areas, who suffered five or six months of devastation from the returned evil landlords and their reactionary corps, had their homes emptied. Many people had nothing to eat at the time, but after the wheat harvest, they still voluntarily handed over public grain. Most of the villages in the Ninth District are in the newly recovered areas along the Pinghan Railway. The grain collection work was completed the fastest this time. The entire district completed the task in only four days. In particular, Liangzhang base point completed it the fastest. After the deployment on the afternoon of the 5th, it was completed by dawn on the 6th. Xu Yongzhang Village has a total of 54 households, with 27 households liable for the contribution, but other people who were not liable said, "We must contribute. The reactionaries oppressed us so much here. The Eighth Route Army works for us, why shouldn't we give them grain to eat?" The poor peasant village chief Li Qiulin and Gui Bao, Qu Qiucheng, Zhang Xuewen and others voluntarily contributed more than 90 jin. Guansi in the Second District is a small village where the enemy and puppets carried out the most cruel reverse reckoning. This time, the military family member Yang Shoucheng and five others voluntarily paid more than 400 jin more. They also wrote a letter to the district saying: "The Eighth Route Army liberated us. Please send a letter to our troops and tell them that this is a token of our appreciation after the wheat harvest." The masses in the Sixth and Seventh Districts, when storing grain, voluntarily proposed that they must hand in good wheat this year, and ensure that it is all processed by winnowing fans and rolling mills. The masses in Li Lintou in the Seventh District proposed: The cadres and militiamen have been carrying guns to fight the enemy very hard, and their families have been severely reversed reckoned. They should contribute less. The cadres and militiamen said: "This is unreasonable. The troops are fighting the enemy in the front line all day long. Shouldn't we hand over some public grain?" They all insisted on reducing the amount. Village chief Sun Zhende said: "Not only will I not reduce it, but I will also pay two dou more!" He paid two dou more. (Anyang Joint Office)
    [Report from our Xiuwu Office] On June 5th, the Fourth District held a mobilization meeting for paying counter-offensive grain. More than 80 cadres and activists from various villages attended. Everyone was in high spirits. Zhao Yunzhong from Dananpo said: "The Eighth Route Army is sacrificing and shedding blood for us on the front lines. In more than ten months, they have eliminated more than 90 enemy brigades. We are about to launch a full-scale counter-offensive. The common people should tighten their belts and contribute more public grain to support the front lines, and eradicate our root of poverty, Chiang Kai-shek, so that we can have good times. When the counter-offensive comes, our troops will increase. We must pay more. Our village will pay 40 shi more than last year and complete it on the 9th." Under his influence, all the villages enthusiastically reported their contributions, all exceeding the number originally assigned by the government, and exceeding last year's number. Shiweng is a poor village with only 70 mu of wheat. They also want to contribute public grain with the wheat they earned from working together and the wheat picked up by women and children. Hei'ai Village contributed 130 shi of public grain, more than half more than last year, and 30 shi more than the number assigned by the government. Jinlingpo and other villages in Dongli all exceeded the original number and strived to complete it on the 10th. A total of 721 shi of grain were voluntarily reported on the spot.

　　安阳修武翻身农民
    踊跃缴纳公粮
    【本报安阳讯】麦收以后，安阳全县群众，热烈屯集“反攻粮”。特别是新收复区与再收复区的群众，他们受了恶霸地主还乡团五六个月的摧残，家中东西都被倒算光了，很多群众当下就没吃的，但是麦收下来之后，他们还都自动缴纳公粮。九区大部村庄是在平汉路两旁的新收复区，这次收粮工作完成最快，只四天全区就都缴齐了，特别是梁张基点出的最快，五号下午布置下去，到六号天明便都缴齐。许永张村全村共五四户，应负担户是二七户，但其他不应负担的群众说：“我们非拿不行，顽固派在这里实在压迫的我们受不了，八路军为咱办事，为啥不发给他粮食吃。”贫农村长李秋林及贵保、瞿秋成、张学文等四人自动拿了九十余斤。二区官司是被敌伪倒算最残酷的一个小村，这次屯粮，军属杨守成等六人自动多缴了四百多斤。并给区上写信说：“八路军解放了我们，请你给咱部队去个信。就说这是我们麦收后的一点心意。”六、七区群众在屯粮，自动提出今年一定要缴好麦子，保证都要过风车过碾。七区李林头群众提出：干部民兵一直背着枪跟敌人打很辛苦，家里被倒算的又厉害，应当少出点。干部民兵说：“这样不合理，部队整天在前面和敌人拚，咱拿些公粮还不该，”都直叫减。村长孙振德说：“我不但不减，而且还要多缴二斗咧！”又多缴了二斗。（安阳联合办公室）
    【本报修武讯】六月五日四区召开了一个缴纳反攻粮动员大会，到各村干部和积极分子八十多人，大家情绪很高，大南坡赵云中说：“八路军在前线上为我们牺牲流血，十个多月消灭了敌人九十多个旅，马上要全面反攻，老百姓应当节衣缩食多缴公粮支援前线，挖掉咱们的总穷根蒋介石，才能有好时光，反攻到来咱们队伍增多了，非多缴不行，我村要比去年多缴四十石，九号完成。”各村在他的影响下踊跃的自报，都超过了政府原派数，与去年数。石瓮是个穷村，共种麦七十亩，拿自己变工赚的麦和妇女小孩拾的麦也要献缴公粮，黑崖村献公粮一百三十石，超过去年一半多，超过政府派数三十石。洞里金龄坡等村都超过原派数，争取十号完成，当场先后共自报献粮七百二十一石。（修武联合办公室）
