　　Ji-Lu-Yu Actively Prepares Counter-Offensive Forces
　　More Than 30,000 Young Men Enlist
　　[Special Dispatch from this newspaper in Ji-Lu-Yu, 30th] Since mid-April, a conscription movement of "Defend the Land, Protect the Homes" has been launched in this region. 50,000 newly emancipated peasants registered to join the army. After strict screening, 37,000 people were sent to the front lines. Eleven counties including Nanfeng, Yanggu, Guancheng, Shouzhang, Fanxian, Zhangqiu, Qingfeng, Qingxi, Junxian, Kunwu, and Zhuxian were involved in this movement. Taking Shouzhang as an example, 80 percent of the young men who enlisted were poor peasants, most of whom were emancipation models, and one-fifth of them were Communist Party members. Among the 1,500 young men who enlisted in Nanfeng, 700 were Communist Party members. In the upsurge of the movement, the masses further developed the slogan "Defend the Land, Protect the Homes" into "Set an Example in Joining the Army and Performing Meritorious Service for the People", and a widespread competition for enlisting and performing meritorious service was launched. In many villages in Nanfeng and Qingfeng, the masses held family meetings to discuss who in their family should join the army and who in other families should join the army. Conscription competitions were launched between families and between individuals. The masses in various villages congratulated the new military dependents, sent honorary plaques, honorary lamps, posted auspicious couplets, invited the new military dependents to eat and drink, the old military dependents asked the new military dependents to talk, the names of conscription heroes were generally written on the blackboard newspapers, and the walls were full of slogans such as "Defend the Land, Protect the Homes" and "Join the Army and Defeat Chiang Kai-shek". Wang, an old lady from Zhukou, Shouzhang, personally sent her two sons, two grandsons, and two nephews, a total of six people, to join the army. She said: "We must repay Chairman Mao's kindness and cannot come back until we have defeated Old Chiang." The heroes and models of meritorious service in the whole region blew their trumpets and carried a large plaque of "People's Hero" to congratulate her. In Weihai Village, Yanggu County, seven young women who had just married sent their husbands to the front line together, and there were also two sisters-in-law who jointly sent their only son. When they sent their sons and husbands, they had to tell about the pain they had suffered and the happy life after emancipation, expressing their deep hatred for Old Chiang. When the new soldiers went to the front line, the masses, village cadres, and new soldiers all made guarantees to each other. The masses guaranteed to take care of the new soldiers' families and ensure that the income of the military dependents would increase compared to before. The women proposed to do work for the military dependents, and the children's corps and sisters' corps guaranteed to chop firewood and sweep the floor for the military dependents. The difficulties of the military dependents were resolved on the spot. The new soldiers guaranteed not to return without defeating Old Chiang. At the Anti-Chiang and Land Protection Conference in Junxian County, more than 5,100 people signed up in ten minutes and discussed plans for meritorious service competitions. Many young women, when seeing off their husbands to join the army, took over the guns from their husbands and organized women's militia to perform rear tasks in place of the men. Women's militias have been established in Nanfeng, Qingfeng, Shouzhang and other counties in the conscription movement. Now the counties are carrying out preferential treatment to military families, and the combination of the front and rear is becoming closer. The reason why this conscription movement has formed such an enthusiastic mass and conscious movement is, on the one hand, due to the masses' urgent desire to join the army to protect the land after the land reform. The residents along the Yellow River are even more determined to join the army for self-defense because Chiang's bandits released water in an attempt to create an unprecedented catastrophe. On the other hand, the successive victories in the liberated areas and the anticipation of a full-scale counter-offensive have inspired the broad masses, and the enthusiasm for preparing for the great counter-offensive is extremely high.

　　冀鲁豫积极准备反攻力量
    三万多青壮上战场
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】从四月中旬开始，本区掀起“反蒋保田”的参军运动，翻身农民报名参军者达五万人。经严格审查，开赴前线者三万七千人。南峰、阳谷、观城、寿张、范县、张秋、清丰、清西、浚县、昆吾、筑先等十一个县卷入这一运动。参军青年以寿张为例，百分之八十为贫农，大部为翻身模范，其中共产党员占五分之一。南峰参军青年一千五百人中，有共产党员七百人。在运动热潮中，群众由“保田保命”的口号进一步发展为“为人民立功带头参军”的口号，普遍展开了参军立功竞赛。南峰和清丰许多村的群众，都开家庭会议，讨论自己家里谁去参军和别人家里谁该去参军。家庭与家庭间，人与人间提出参军竞赛。各村群众纷纷给新军属道喜，送光荣匾，光荣灯，贴喜对联，请新军属吃饭喝酒，老军属请新军属谈心，黑板报上普遍写着参军英雄姓名，墙壁上写满了“保田保命”、“参军打败蒋介石”的标语。寿张朱口的王老太太亲送她的两个儿子、两个孙子、两个侄子共六个人参军，她说：“要去报毛主席的恩，不把老蒋打完不能回来”。全区的功臣模范们吹着喇叭，抬着“人民功臣”的大匾给她道喜，阳谷县魏海村有七个才结婚的青年妇女，一齐送郎上前线，还有妯娌两个合送一个独生子的。她们送子送郎时，都要诉说一遍自己受过的痛苦和翻身以后的快乐生活，表示出对于老蒋的深刻仇恨。新战士开赴前线时，群众村干部和新战士均互相提出保证，群众保证照顾新战士家属、保证军属收入比以前增加，妇女提出给军属做活，儿童团和姐妹团保证给军属打柴扫地，军属困难均当场一一解决。新战士保证不打垮老蒋不回来。浚县反蒋保田大会上，十分钟内报名五千一百多人，并讨论立功竞赛计划，新战士互相提出杀敌竞赛。许多青年妇女在欢送自己丈夫参军时，即从男人手上接过枪来组织女民兵，代替男人执行后方任务。南峰、清丰、寿张等县均在参军运动中建立起妇女民兵。现在各县正在进行优军，前后方结合更为密切。此次参军运动所以形成如此热烈之群众自觉运动的原因，一方面是出于土地改革以后群众迫切要求参军保田，黄河沿岸居民更由于蒋贼放水，企图制造空前浩劫，因而奋起参军自卫。另一方面是各解放区纷纷大捷，全面反攻在望，鼓舞了广大群众，准备大反攻的热情极为高涨。
