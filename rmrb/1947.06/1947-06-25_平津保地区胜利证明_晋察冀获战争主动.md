　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 22nd: Frontline reporters report: The victorious offensive of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army on the three lines of Jinpu, Beining, and Pinghan has completely fragmented the transportation in the Pingjinbao area. Currently, the Jiang's and puppet troops in this area, especially in the heart of North China, Pingjin, are conscripting laborers to build fortifications, attempting to hold out in a siege. Sun Lianzhong once boasted shamelessly, repeatedly declaring that he would "restore traffic between Baoding and Shijiazhuang" and "eliminate the Communist troops in the Pingjinbao triangular area to remove the threat to Pingjinbao." Now, even the transportation in Pingjin has to be maintained by a giant aircraft dispatched by the Sino-American Aviation Corporation. The Jin-Cha-Ji Liberation Army, shortly after clearing the periphery of Shijiazhuang and sweeping the Zhengtai Line, has achieved another major victory, proving that the Jiang's troops lack sufficient forces, are stretched thin, and their combat effectiveness is declining with each battle, while the Liberation Army's combat effectiveness is increasing with each battle. The Liberation Army has completely taken the initiative.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinpu Frontline, 22nd: Frontline reporters report on the capture of Cangxian: At 7 p.m. on the 14th, amidst wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, our troops launched a general offensive against the city of Cangxian. The enemy garrisoned within the city numbered approximately 4,000, the city was small, the number of people was large, and the firepower was intense. The city moat was filled with deep water, even the shallowest parts were enough to submerge a person. The moat was over three zhang wide, and the widest point reached over one li. During the attack, the 3rd company of a certain unit of the Liberation Army, under such adverse weather and terrain conditions, braving the enemy's fierce resistance, completed the task of building bridges, erecting ladders, and scaling the city walls in just 13 minutes. Other units successively ascended the city walls, completely compressing the defending enemy into the southeast corner of the city. The enemy was panic-stricken, attempting to break through the east gate, but several hundred of their vanguard troops were captured by the Liberation Army's ambushing forces as soon as they left the city. The enemy's main force retreated back into the city to continue their stubborn resistance. Although the rain had stopped at this time, the sky was already dark, and our troops entering the city launched street fighting, completely annihilating the enemy, and Cangxian was liberated.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd: The social order in the newly liberated Cangzhou and Qingxian and other places in the northern section of Jinpu has been restored. Shops have completely opened for business, and vendors selling cigarettes, vegetables, and other small items are swarming the market, making the market lively. The Provincial No. 1 Middle School, the Provincial Agricultural Vocational School, and other schools in Cangxian will also resume classes soon. Workers in various industries in Cang City, such as electricity, tap water, repair shops, and railways, have received relief from the democratic government first. In addition, more than 200 wounded soldiers abandoned by Jiang's puppet troops have been taken in by the People's Liberation Army's forward hospitals and are receiving medical treatment.

　　平津保地区胜利证明
    晋察冀获战争主动
    【新华社晋察冀二十二日电】前线记者报导：晋察冀人民解放军对津浦、北宁、平汉三线的胜利攻势，已使平津保交通完全陷入支离破碎。现该地区蒋伪特别是华北心脏的平津，正抓丁大修工事，图作困守。孙连仲曾大言不惭，一再宣称要“恢复保定石家庄间的交通”，要“肃清平津保三角地区的共军，解除对平津保的威胁”，现在连平津交通也要由中美航空公司派巨型飞机一架来维持了。晋察冀解放军在肃清石家庄外围，横扫正太线之后为时不久，又获重大胜利，证明蒋军兵力不足捉襟见肘，战力愈战愈低下，而解放军的战力则愈战愈高。解放军已完全掌握了主动权。
    【新华社津浦前线二十二日电】前线记者报导解放沧县称：十四日下午七时，我军于风雨雷电交加中向沧县城发动总攻，城内守敌约四千人，城小人多炮火炽烈。城壕贮水很深，浅处亦足没顶，壕宽三丈余，最宽处达一华里以上。进攻时，解放军某部三连在这样恶劣天气与地形条件下，冒着敌人的猛烈抵抗，仅十三分钟即完成了搭桥、架梯与登城的任务。其他各部陆续登城，将守敌完全压缩至城东南一隅，该敌惊慌失措，企图由东门突围，但其先头部队数百人一出城即被解放军预伏部队将其俘虏。敌主力复缩回城内继续顽抗，当时雨虽停止，但天色已黑，我入城部队即展开巷战，将敌全部解决，沧县遂告解放。
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】津浦北段新解放之沧州及青县等地，社会秩序均已恢复。商店已完全开门营业，纸烟、蔬菜等小贩蜂涌上市，市面热闹。沧县之省立第一中学、省立农职学校等，日内亦可复课。沧市电灯、自来水、修械、铁路等各业工人已首先得到民主政府救济。又：被蒋伪军遗弃之伤兵二百余人，已为人民解放军前方医院收容，予以疗诊。
