Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 6th: The Chiang government's attempt to collect gold and U.S. dollars from the people to fund the civil war by issuing 400 million U.S. dollar "U.S. Dollar Bonds" has failed. According to reports, from the issuance on April 8th to May 2nd, within 25 days, only over 1.5 million U.S. dollars were sold, less than 4% of the total amount. The Chiang government had exhausted all means on these bonds, organizing "Fundraising and Sales Committees" throughout the country, with the personal financial standing of the fundraising committee members as guarantee. It also repeatedly held receptions and press conferences for the financial community in Shanghai, and loudly advertised on the radio: "Quickly subscribe to U.S. Dollar Bonds," etc. Now, they can only hang their heads in despair and admit failure, saying: "U.S. Dollar Bonds cannot attract floating capital, and the Central Bank is in a passive position regarding the bonds." Ta Kung Pao even sarcastically stated: "If the people think it is worth sacrificing (referring to raising funds for Chiang Kai-shek's civil war), then there is no need to consider government bonds and the guarantees of the fundraising committee members." Currently, in addition to preparing to issue the bonds at a discount and selling them on the market, the Chiang government is also implementing a system of forced allocation, requiring all staff of the four banks and two bureaus to purchase bonds with at least their April salaries. When the four banks provide loans to various production, transportation, public utilities, they will also include U.S. dollar bonds.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 7th: After the Chiang government's failure to issue U.S. dollar bonds and treasury bills, it will issue large amounts of so-called "short-term high-interest treasury bills" to extort funds for the civil war. According to Shanghai reports, the denominations of these bills will be divided into six types: 500,000 yuan, 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, 4 million, and 5 million yuan, with interest rates ranging from 6% to 12%, depending on the duration, ranging from one to six months. The Shanghai financial community is not interested in these bills, because the interest rates in the Shanghai speculative market are as high as 40% or more, and it will be difficult for the so-called "high-interest treasury bills" to compete. As for the deposits of general commercial firms, they may be largely absorbed by its "high interest," accelerating their bankruptcy.

　　人民不肯替蒋筹内战经费
    “美金债券”销不出
    蒋介石垂头丧气自认失败
    【新华社陕北六日电】蒋政府为搜括民间黄金美钞充内战经费发行之四万万美元“美金债券”，已告失败。据该报载：自四月八日发出到五月二日廿五天内，仅售出一千五百余万美元，为总额百分之四弱。此项债券，蒋政府曾费尽心机，于全国各地组织“募销委员会”以募销委员私人金融界地位担保，并屡次在沪市举行金融界招待会、记者会，在广播中又大声叫卖：“快快认购美金大券”等等。现在只得垂头丧气，自认失败的说：“美金债券不能吸引游资，央行对债券已处于被动地位”。大公报更讽称：“如果人民认为值得牺牲（按指替蒋介石筹内战经费），就无庸考虑政府债券和募销委员会诸公的保证。”现蒋政府除将债券准备折扣发行及于市场买卖外，并实行强迫压派制度，四行两局全体人员至少须以四月份薪金购买债券，各生产、运销、交通、公用事业，四行予以贷款时，亦将搭配美金债券。
    【新华社陕北七日电】蒋政府在发行美金公债库券失败后，又将大量发行所谓“短期高利库券”，以勒骗内战费用。据沪报载：该券票面将分五十万元、一百万、二百万、三百万、四百万、五百万等六种，利息自六分至一角二分，视期间而定，时间一至六个月。沪金融界对此券并不感兴趣，因沪上投机市场之利率有高至四角以上者，而所谓“收利库券”即欲竞争，亦难奏效。至于一般商业行庄之存款，则可能为其“高利”大量吸去而加速倒闭。
