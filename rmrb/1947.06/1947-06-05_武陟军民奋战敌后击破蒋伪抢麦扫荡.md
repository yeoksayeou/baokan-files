　　Military and Civilians of Wuzhi Fight Behind Enemy Lines, Crushing Chiang Kai-shek and Puppet Troops' Grain Robbery and Sweep
    [This newspaper reports] More than a thousand Chiang Kai-shek and puppet troops from Mulin Store, Xincheng, Wuzhi, at the request of the stubborn county government and special agent bully landlords, planned to continuously sweep our enemy's rear base area for seven days, in order to cover up their looting of the wheat harvest. At dawn on the 16th, the enemy and puppet troops advanced in three routes toward Da Xiaoli Village, Xiao Dong, Xiao Gao, and Da Bei Fan. The Da Fan contingent was its main force, creeping westward along the Qin River levee. At Da Fan, it was chased by our Wuzhi working team, and the enemy suffered one killed and one wounded. In the area west of Da Fan, it was again severely attacked head-on by our battalion, killing and wounding sixteen enemy puppet troops. When they arrived at Xiao Dong, our battalion soldiers, working team, and militia engaged the enemy in a fierce fight, turning their plan to rob grain in Xiao Dong into a pipe dream, and they retreated without even being able to eat. At dawn on the 19th, five contingents of enemy puppet troops mobilized toward Xiao Gao to rob wheat. Parts of our battalion soldiers and working team launched a counterattack against the enemy, driving more than a hundred enemies from Xiao Gao to Bei Fan, tracking and killing or wounding more than thirty of them. The Tieluotou contingent was driven back by our working team, with a total of six killed, wounded, and captured. At this point, Chiang Kai-shek and the puppet troops' seven-day sweep plan failed. We killed or wounded more than fifty enemy troops in total, and captured more than twenty grain-grabbing bullies. In order to crack down on the enemy and puppet troops' grain-grabbing conspiracy, on the night of the 22nd, we again organized forces to raid the puppet strongholds of Dacheng, Xiaoyan, and Xiaoxugang east of Mulin Store. In Dacheng, we captured fifteen people, including the head of the puppet township office, and seized fifteen rifles, and arrested more than twenty bullies. (Ji Zhen)
    [This newspaper reports] The Jiaozuo Public Security Team is going all out to protect the wheat harvest, and has reaped forty-two acres of wheat in four days.
    On May 20th, the public security team actively responded to the call of the higher authorities to form four wheat harvesting teams in the protection of the wheat harvest, and helped the masses in Xizhang Village harvest wheat for four days, with extremely high morale. There was a competition between shifts and between individuals. Liu Hongsheng, the deputy squad leader of squad one, proposed an individual competition plan: (1) If the enemy comes, guarantee to kill an enemy with three shots; (2) If there is a small group activity, guarantee to capture the top dog for reckoning; (3) In addition to work, help the masses harvest three acres of wheat. (Li Junqing, Han Mangui)
    [This newspaper reports from] Taihang: The troops of the Fourth Sub-district of Taihang are closing in on Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn strongholds, going all out to crack down on Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn outer grain robbery, and capturing traitorous landlords who have returned to their hometowns to grab grain. The Commissioner's Office has specially issued a reward method for protecting wheat, stipulating: (1) Troops, militia, and working teams will be given honorary awards for confiscating grain looted from the masses by the enemy, but it should be returned to the masses unconditionally; (2) Those who recover public grain looted by the enemy will be rewarded with one-fourth of the value; (3) Those who seize grain stored in enemy military and government organs (including those stored in maintenance villages) and private grain stored by stubborn puppet ringleaders will be rewarded with half of the value; (4) Those who provide information to help us find it will be rewarded with 15 to 20 percent; (5) Those who successfully complete the collection task in the administrative border area will be rewarded with 1 to 3 percent for meritorious personnel and armed forces. All agencies in the sub-district stopped working and devoted themselves to helping with the harvest.
