　　The Example of a Liberated Soldier
    ——On Special-Class Meritorious Service Member Li Baoquan
    Feng Mu
    On the Jinan front, I saw many soldiers of Hu Zongnan's army who had been liberated and soon became soldiers, even key members, of the People's Army. Li Baoquan, a special-class meritorious service member of a certain regiment, is a typical example. Li Baoquan was liberated from the 167th Brigade of Hu's First Division last year. Shortly after being liberated, he voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army. In his first battle – the Chenyan Battle – he displayed astonishing loyalty and courage. He had never been a combat soldier before, but when he fought, he was like a veteran. He used his "Number One Army" credentials to call out to the soldiers of the First Brigade in a courtyard, causing thirty-nine enemies to surrender their weapons. In the Dongdawang Battle of Fen and Xiao, he bravely pursued the enemy barefoot on ice and snow, capturing four prisoners and four guns in one breath. In the Yuncheng Airport Battle, he braved the enemy's intense firepower blockade, the first to sneak through the enemy's minefield, conducting three reconnaissance missions, even to the point of counting the number of wooden stakes of the barbed wire by hand, and hearing the enemy's conversations in the forward bunkers. For the fourth time, he voluntarily took on the task of being a demolitionist and assault team member, rushing close to the enemy, blowing up the barbed wire, helping to set up the springboard, and throwing thirty-some grenades into the enemy's fortifications. Finally, as a member of the assault team, he rushed through the enemy's forward positions. During the battle, he was wounded three times in succession, but he didn't even look for the medic, continuing to fight. For this, he received the glorious title of Special-Class People's Meritorious Service Member for the second time.

    How coincidentally arranged! The time and place where Li Baoquan was hailed and celebrated by the Jinan masses as a people's meritorious service member was exactly the same time and place where he was forced to serve as a tool of civil war last year. When I curiously went to visit him, he told me about his past experiences. This made me understand the secret of why many Kuomintang soldiers became people's soldiers immediately after being liberated. It made me understand the road of a liberated soldier.

    Twenty-four-year-old Li Baoquan is from Mian County, southern Shaanxi. His family has eight members and lives by cutting down trees and shaving bamboo strips. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, his eldest uncle was conscripted, and his father cut off his right arm to avoid service. The family could only rely on young Li Baoquan to go up the mountain to cut wood every day to make a living. After finally saving a thousand yuan, he rented two mu of land. Just after fertilizing it, the landlord colluded with the head of the village and took the land back. In 1944, the head of the village threatened him with conscription and forced him to work at his house. He worked fifteen or sixteen hours a day for several months, and he wasn't even allowed to go home to visit. After repeated requests, he was allowed to go back once. As soon as he got home, his parents complained that the family couldn't survive and couldn't cope with the corvée labor. Li Baoquan was so anxious and tired that he fell ill. The head of the village said he was evading service and sent thugs to tie him up to the joint defense office. Li Baoquan couldn't bear it and escaped into the deep mountains. The head of the village then tied up his parents and hung them at the joint defense office, ordering them to call their son back. After a few days, they sent people to escort his parents into the mountains to find him. When he heard his father's cries, he couldn't bear to hide in the forest any longer and voluntarily returned to the joint defense office. After being beaten several times, the head of the village sold him as a conscript.

    He was escorted to the 167th Brigade and tied together during the march. Each person had to carry fifty or sixty catties of rice. It was said to be military rations, but they were not allowed to eat it. From Hanzhong to Baoji, eight hundred out of two thousand people died. Later, he was assigned to the transportation company to carry the officers' luggage, which weighed seventy or eighty catties. If he walked slowly, he would be beaten with a stick. When the troops were stationed, they had to build toilets and roads. While others camped, they still had to do construction. The 167th Brigade went to southern Shanxi to fight the civil war and stayed in the Yuncheng and Anyi area for more than a year, and he suffered like this for more than a year.

    Last summer, the Chiang Kai-shek troops fought with the Liberation Army and were surrounded in a village. The company commander said to Li Baoquan: "You are carrying the deputy regimental commander's belongings. If you lose them, you will be killed!" Li Baoquan said: "The things are too heavy, I'm afraid it will be difficult to run." The company commander slapped him a few times. He thought: "Everyone says the Eighth Route Army is powerful, hurry up and fight in!" Sure enough, they were liberated a few minutes later. When he saw the warmth of the military and civilians in the liberated areas, it completely confirmed the rumors he had heard about the Red Army in his hometown: "If you don't work hard in this army, you will really be sorry to your parents!" He always thought about revenge, about rescuing his parents from suffering. He also understood that if he wanted to liberate his home, he had to fight well and eliminate Hu Zongnan. When he heard some comrades missing home during the battle, he persuaded them: "Comrades, your families have been liberated, you must help me take revenge and liberate my home!" A wave of safeguarding Chairman Mao was set off in the army. Li Baoquan was the first to submit a request, handing over his hero badge and everything he had. He said: "Only with Chairman Mao can we poor people have a chance to rise! Only with Chairman Mao can I take revenge! I will live and die following Chairman Mao to eliminate those man-eating insects and liberate my hometown."

　　解放战士的榜样
    ——记特等功臣李保全
    冯牧
    我在晋南前线上看到许多被解放的胡宗南军士兵，不久就变成了人民军队的战士，甚至骨干。其中某团的特等功臣李保全即是典型的一个。李保全是去年从胡军第一师一六七旅解放过来的。解放后不久，就自动参加解放军。在第一次战斗——陈堰战斗中，他就表现了令人惊异的忠勇。他过去没有作过战斗兵，但他打起仗来却像一个老战士一样。他以“天下第一军”的资格向一座院子里的第一旅的兵士喊话，使卅九个敌人缴了枪。在汾、孝的东大王战斗中，他赤脚在冰雪上勇猛追击敌人，一口气抓到了四个俘虏四支枪。在运城飞机场战斗中，冒着敌人密集火力的封锁，第一个潜行过敌之布雷区，接运进行了三次侦察，一直侦察到用手摸着数清了铁丝网的木桩根数，听到了前沿暗碉里敌人的对话。第四次他又自动担负了爆炸手和突击队的任务，冲近敌人身边，炸毁了铁丝网，帮助搭上了跳板，并向敌人工事摔了卅几颗炸弹。最后又作为突击队的一员冲过敌人的前沿工事。战斗中，他接连受了三次伤，但连卫生员都不找，依然坚持战斗。为此，他第二次获得特等人民功臣的光荣称号。
    事情安排得多凑巧！李保全以人民功臣的资格受到晋南群众的欢呼庆贺的时间和地点，恰恰就是他去年被迫充当内战工具而作战的同一时间和地点。当我好奇地去访问他时，他告诉我他过去的遭遇。这使我懂得了许多国民党士兵一被解放即成人民战士的秘密。使我懂得了一个解放战士的道路。
    二十四岁的李保全是陕南沔县人，家里八口人，靠砍树木、削竹片为生。抗战初，大伯被抓了壮丁，父亲为躲役砍断了右臂。家里只能指望年幼的李保全每天上山伐木度日。好容易积了一千元钱，租下了二亩地，刚上了粪，又被地主买通保长，把地夺了回去。四四年保长又以抓兵威胁他，强迫他到保长家去作工。每天作十五、六小时，一连作了几个月，他想回家去看看都不准。再三请求，才允许回去一趟。刚一回家，父母便哭诉家里没法活，应付不了差役。李保全又急又累，病倒了。保长却说他逃役，派狗腿把他捆到了联保处，李保全忍耐不住，便逃到深山里去，保长又把他父母捆走，吊在联保处，要他们叫儿子回来。过了几天，又派人把他父母押到山里去找他。当他听见父亲的哭喊声时，他再也不能忍心在森林藏匿，便自动回到联保处去。挨了几顿吊打之后，保长把他卖了壮丁。
    他被押到一六七旅，行军时捆在一起。每个人要背五、六十斤大米。说是军粮，但不准他们吃。从汉中行军到宝鸡，两千人拖死了八百。以后他被分到运送连担当官的行李，要担七、八十斤重，走慢了就要挨棍子，驻军时就修厕所、修路。别人宿营，他们还得做工事。一六七旅开到晋南来打内战，在运城、安邑一带住了一年多，他就受了一年多这样的罪。
    去年夏天蒋家部队和解放军作战，在某村被包围了。连长对李保全说：“你担的是副团长的东西，丢了要杀头！”李保全说：“东西太重，怕不好跑。”连长就打了他几耳光。他想：“人都说八路军厉害，快打进来吧！”果然，几分钟后他们便被解放了。当他看见了解放区军民的亲热，完全证实了他在故乡听到关于红军的传说：“在这个队伍里要不好好干，可真对不起父母！”他时时惦念着报仇，惦念着把苦难中的父母解救出来，他又懂得了如果要解放自己的家，就必须好好作战，把胡宗南消灭。当他在战斗时听到有的同志想家，他便劝说着：“同志，你们家里解放了，你可要帮助我报仇，解放我的家呀！”部队里掀起了保卫毛主席热潮，李保全第一个递出了请求书，交出了他的英雄章和所有的东西。他说：“有毛主席才有我们穷人出头的日子！有毛主席我才能报仇！我生生死死也要随着毛主席消灭那些吃人虫，解放我的家乡去。”
