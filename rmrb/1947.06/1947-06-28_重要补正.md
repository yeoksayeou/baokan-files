　　Xinhua News Agency telegraphed: "Regarding the list of captured Chiang army generals in May released by this agency yesterday, it has now been verified that it also includes Li Yunliang, Major General and Deputy Chief of Staff of the 74th Division (formerly self-reported as Colonel). Therefore, the total number of captives in May should be 24, and the total number of Chiang army generals captured in the past eleven months should be 160. Please correct this."
