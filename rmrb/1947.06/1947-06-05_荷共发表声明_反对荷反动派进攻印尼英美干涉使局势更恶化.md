　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS, The Hague reports: Dutch Prime Minister Beel's statement that "doubts remain as to whether the Republic is willing to build a Dutch federation with the Netherlands" has been regarded by the Dutch left-wing newspapers as a signal to undermine the Dutch-Indonesian agreement. De Waarheid published a statement from the Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party as follows: "The colonialists are again attempting to attack the Republic. Right-wing parties have engaged in conspiracies to reorganize the cabinet in order to abolish the treaty and launch an open war. The Dutch Communist Party sends a letter to the Labor Party, the Trade Union Federation, and all democratic elements, urging them to take active measures to oppose the reactionaries' attempt to plunge Indonesia into an endless and hopeless war of bloodshed. All people must loudly oppose the colonialists' military plans and cooperate with Indonesia on an equal footing."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS, The Hague reports: According to Dutch newspapers, on May 27th, the Dutch Governor-General of Batavia, Mook, sent a note to the leaders of the Republic of Indonesia, stating that the Netherlands is taking resolute measures on the Indonesian issue to "overcome the deadlock in the Indonesian issue."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS, The Hague reports: Dutch newspapers report: The interference of British and American authorities in Indonesian affairs is making the situation in the archipelago even worse. Merdeka reported: The Dutch colonial group has now changed their tactics and propaganda, and they are trying to prove that the influence of the Communist Party is dominant in the archipelago in order to involve Truman in this "holy" war and jointly combat communism; through this kind of propaganda, they have achieved some purpose. The Bandelblad, which reflects the attitude of the Dutch liberal group, declared: British and American interference in the internal relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia is increasing, as evidenced by Bevin's recent statement on Indonesian affairs in the House of Commons. The development of the Indonesian situation continues to deteriorate; tense warfare between the Dutch army and the Indonesian people has begun again in many places. Through their agents, the Dutch have occupied all the agencies of the Republic authorities in Java and Bogor, and are carrying out large-scale arrests. The Central Committee of Borneo Youth has sent a letter to the President of the Republic, Sukarno, expressing its oath to liberate the island from foreign aggressors with the greatest effort and make it an integral part of the free Republic of Indonesia.

    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰首相比尔斯·马加沙尔的“怀疑共和国是否愿意与荷兰共建荷兰联邦”之声明，已被荷兰左翼各报视为破坏荷兰与印尼协定之信号。德·瓦尔海德报发表荷兰共产党中央委员会之声明如下：“殖民分子们又在企图攻击共和国。右翼各党已从事重组内阁之阴谋，以便废除条约并发动公开的战争。荷共致函工党、联工会及所有民主分子，敦促他们采取积极行动，反对反动派企图使印度尼西亚陷于无尽止与无望的流血战争中。全体人民必须大声疾呼反对殖民者的军事计划，并在平等基础上与印尼合作。”

    【新华社陕北一日电】塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰报纸报导：英美当局对印尼事务之干涉，正使该群岛之情势更形恶化。迈尔德卡报称：荷兰殖民集团现在已改变了他们的策略和宣传，他们力求证实共产党在群岛上之影响是占优势的，以使杜鲁门牵入此“神圣”之战争而共同打击共产主义；借这一种宣传，他们已经达到某种目的。反映荷兰自由主义集团态度的班德尔伯拉德报宣称：英美对荷兰与印尼间内部关系之干涉正在增加中，这由贝文最近在下院对印尼事务之陈述得到证明。印尼局势之发展，继续日形恶化；荷兰军队与印尼人民之间的紧张战争，又在许多地方开始了。通过他们的代理者，荷兰在爪哇、茂物占有所有共和国当局的各机关，并且实行大规模的逮捕。婆罗洲青年中央委员会顷致函共和国总统苏加诺，表示誓以最大的努力，从外国侵略者手中解放该岛，使它成为自由印尼共和之整体的部分。
