　　Zhao Jinyin Pays Old Debts in Tangyin
　　Jun Ce, Hua Bo
　　On May 1st of that day,
　　We captured Tangyin and entered the city gate,
　　The People's Army has good discipline,
　　No one touched even a single hair of the common people.
　　There are many stories of love for the people that can't be told enough,
　　Let's just talk about Zhao Jinyin paying back old debts:
　　Zhao Jinyin was a quartermaster,
　　He was in the Sixth Company of the 84th Regiment.
　　The year before last, Tangyin County was recovered,
　　The troops were stationed at the West Gate.
　　We thought peace talks would be fine,
　　Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek's army sneaked to the South Gate.
　　Without a word, they opened fire,
　　We retreated to West Mountain.
　　Zhao Jinyin was very worried,
　　There were still procedures not completed.
　　Eighty catties of vegetables were bought on Yue Temple Street.
　　He took the vegetables and owed money.
　　From then on, he often thought about it,
　　When will this debt be repaid?
　　It felt like a stone was pressing on his chest,
　　It pressed for a full two years.
　　Today Tangyin County is opened,
　　Everyone is happy in their hearts.
　　Zhao Jinyin is even happier,
　　Finally, there is this day!
　　The next day he went into the city early,
　　To Yue Temple Street to pay back the old debt.
　　Zhao Jinyin hurried along,
　　Entered the North Gate towards the South Gate,
　　Piles of guns, cannons, and prisoners,
　t have the mood to see clearly.
　　He took out his diary from his pocket,
　　The notes were written clearly on the book,
　　Following the diary to find the place,
　　He went straight to the door of the Cui family.
　　He entered the door and shouted to Cui the Sixth Shopkeeper,
　　The shopkeeper was startled in the house:
　　The door had been closed tightly all night,
　　And I hadn't left the house this morning,
　　But someone called me,
　　He looks like a Eighth Route Army soldier.
　　Could it be checking for special agents and traitors,
　　Could it be that something went wrong?
　　He carefully opened the door to see,
　　The visitor had a smiling face,
　　Before the shopkeeper could ask,
　　Zhao Jinyin first explained clearly,
　　He told the story of the debt,
　　Shopkeeper Cui finally remembered the old matter.
　　Shopkeeper Cui was surprised, happy, and delighted,
　　As soon as the Eighth Route Army came, they paid back the old debts:
　　"The matter has been over for two whole years,
　　I have long forgotten it,
　　Speaking of the matter, let it be,
　　Don't give me any money."
　　Quartermaster Zhao hurriedly said:
　　"Shopkeeper Cui, please forgive me:
　　The situation was tight the year before last,
　　It was not intentional that I did not give the money.
　　Today, I sincerely want to pay you back,
　　If you don't take it, I will be uneasy.
　　The debt has been pressing for a long time,
　　These two years have really made you suffer.
　　Money was expensive and grain was cheap the year before last,
　　I shouldn't give you the old price.
　　According to the rice price of the year before last, converted into rice,
　　It should be converted into seventeen and a half catties,
　　In addition, add two and a half catties,
　　Count it as two years of dividend money,
　　This is millet, please accept it,
　　The People's Army should pay back the people!"
　　The shopkeeper accepted the rice with a happy face,
　　Zhao Jinyin felt happy paying back the debt,
　　The bluestone slab was removed from his heart,
　　Look at how lightly he walks now.
　　From then on, Cui the Sixth told everyone about this,
　　Zhao Jinyin's good name spread everywhere.

　　赵金银汤阴还旧账
    钧策　化波
    五月一号那一天，
    打下汤阴进城关，
    人民军队纪律好，
    老百姓的一根汗毛也没人粘。
    有许多爱民故事讲不尽，
    单说说赵金银把旧账还：
    赵金银当的是个司务长，
    他就在八四部队第六连。
    前年收复汤阴县，
    部队驻防城西关。
    只说是和平谈判不打紧，
    冷不防蒋家军偷偷摸到城门南。
    二话不说开炮干，
    我们忍让过西山。
    赵金银心里干着急，
    还有手续没清完。
    岳庙街买下青菜八十斤。
    拿了蔬菜欠下钱。
    从此他心里常盘算，
    这笔欠账啥时候还？
    好像石头胸前压，
    足足压了一两年。
    今天打开了汤阴县，
    人人喜笑在心间。
    赵金银心里更欢喜，
    到头又有这一天！
    第二天早早进城去，
    岳庙街来把旧账还。
    赵金银，急忙行，
    进了北门向南门，
    枪炮俘虏一大堆，
    那有心情看分明。
    怀中掏出日记本，
    本子上面写的清，
    照着日记往前访，
    一直访到崔家门。
    进门就向崔六掌柜喊，
    掌柜在屋里吃一惊：
    一夜房门关的紧，
    一早也没出门庭，
    偏偏有人把我喊，
    看他像个八路军。
    莫不是清查特务和汉奸，
    莫不是闯了啥事情？
    小心小意开门看，
    来人满面笑盈盈，
    不等掌柜开口问，
    赵金银首先说分明，
    他把那欠账事儿讲一遍，
    崔掌柜好容易这才记起旧事情。
    崔掌柜又惊又喜又稀罕，
    八路军一来就把老账还：
    “事情过了两年整，
    我早就不记在心间，
    事情说到也就算，
    千万不要给我钱。”
    赵司务长忙开言：
    “崔六掌柜多包涵：
    前年情况来的紧，
    不是我故意不给钱。
    今天实意要还你，
    你若不要我心不安。
    欠账压的时间久，
    这二年实在叫你受艰难。
    前年钱贵粮米贱，
    不当给你老价钱。
    按前年的米价钱折米，
    应该折成十七斤半，
    另外再加二斤半，
    算作两年红利钱，
    这是小米请收下，
    人民军欠下人民理应还！”
    掌柜收米喜满面，
    赵金银还账心畅宽，
    心上揭去青石板，
    你看他走起路来也轻便。
    从此崔六逢人便讲这件事，
    赵金银美名到处传。
