[By our newspaper's Yu Bei Frontline dispatch of the 10th] The Blackboard Newspaper movement of the Yi character troops, after being continuously published in this newspaper, has been highly valued by the frontline units and has been rapidly promoted. The most popular form of blackboard newspaper among the soldiers that the reporter saw in a certain unit's machine gun company was the cartoon accompanied by clapper rhyme. These cartoons all use extremely simple strokes to draw the characteristics, and then add clapper rhymes, which are interesting to watch and read aloud. For example, Cao Tongyang drew a picture of the cook kneading dough. The kneader's right shoulder is high and the left shoulder is low. Anyone familiar with him knows that it is Han Youzhong. Although the outline of the characters cannot be fully drawn, the expression on the screen can also make people understand it at a glance. The clapper rhyme for this painting reads: "Yang Chengshan, Zhang Guangliang, Zhu Youhu, Han Youzhong, these four comrades are really capable. They get up in the middle of the night to knead dough, and sweep the yard at dawn, and carry water in the evening. They work actively and quickly all day long, and compete to do errands." Some cartoons without explanatory text can also make people understand their meaning. For example, Chen Yanhai feeds livestock. The picture shows a horse eating grass in a trough, with a round butt, and the feeder smiling with his mouth wide open, indicating that the feeder has fed the horse well and is very happy. Another picture shows Li Xiaoyun and Liu Xuezhi competing to carry water. The bucket carried by one person is not vertical, but is drawn skewed in different directions. Another person is pulling the head of the carrying pole. The characters do not look very similar, but those who know the story understand it at a glance, so everyone in the class loves to watch it.

　　门板报运动迅速推广
    漫画快板反映生活
    极受各部战士欢迎
    【本报豫北前线十日电】毅字部队的门板报运动，在本报连续发表后，极为前线各部重视，且迅速推广。记者在某部队机炮连见到的门板报，最为战士欢迎的形式，是带快板的漫画。此种漫画均以极简单的几笔画出特点，再加以快板，边看边念，趣味横生。如曹同养画火房和面的一幅画，和面人的右肩高，左肩低，熟识的人一看就知道是韩有忠。人物轮廓虽不能十分勾画出来，但就其画面的表情，也能使人一目了然。这幅画的快板上这样写着：“杨成善、张光梁、朱有祜、韩有忠，这四个同志真能干。半夜起，同和面，天明就把院子扫，到晚又把水来担。整日工作积极快，勤务公差争着干。”有些不带说明文字的漫画，也能使人了解其意义，如陈延海喂牲口，画的是一匹马在槽里吃草，屁股圆圆的，饲养员在旁边张着大嘴笑，表示饲养员把马喂肥了，心里很高兴。另一幅是画李小云和刘学治争着担水，一个人挑着的水桶不是垂直的，而是画成向不同方向歪斜着，另一个人拉着扁担头子，看人物是不很像，但是知道这故事的人一看就明白，所以全班的人都爱看。
