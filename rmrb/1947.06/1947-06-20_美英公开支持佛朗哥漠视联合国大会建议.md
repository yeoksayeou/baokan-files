Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th: TASS Moscow dispatch: The *Pravda* international observer writes: It has been almost six months since the UN General Assembly passed the recommendation that member states recall their ambassadors and ministers to Franco's Spain. This period has been primarily used by Britain and the United States to consolidate their economic ties with Franco's Spain in various ways. Currently, Franco's secret envoy is in the United States negotiating a $200 million loan. As the British newspaper *Observer* wrote, the United States' increasing interest in Spanish affairs is due to Spain's geographical importance under the United States' new policy towards Greece and Turkey. The Spanish *Informaciones* writes: "Britain is now openly supporting Franco's fascist regime," and it "is becoming a political bet for Britain and the United States." It is clear that the UN General Assembly's recommendations regarding the Franco regime have been truly disregarded. The policies implemented by Britain and the United States are strengthening Franco's position, violating the fundamental interests of Spanish democracy, and damaging the credibility of the United Nations. The Spanish question must ultimately be resolved in this way: to permanently eliminate the regime established through the joint efforts of Hitler and Mussolini, whose continued existence endangers world peace and democracy.

　　美英公开支持佛朗哥漠视联合国大会建议
    【新华社陕北十六日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报国际观察家写道：自联合国大会通过建议各会员国召回他们驻佛朗哥西班牙之大使和公使以来，已快六个月了。这一个时期，被英美首先利用来以各种方法巩固他们与佛朗哥西班牙内的经济联系。现时佛朗哥的密使正在美国商谈二万万美元的贷款。如同英国报纸观察家所写的，美国对西班牙事务之益增兴趣，是因为依照美国对希土新政策，是西班牙有地理上的重要性。西班牙《记录新闻》写道：“英国现在公开支持着佛朗哥的法西斯政体”，它“正成为英美的政治赌注。”很明显的，联合国大会关于佛朗哥政权方面的建议是真正的被漠视了，英美所实行的政策正增强着佛朗哥的地位，干犯了西班牙民主的根本利益及损伤了联合国机构的威信。西班牙问题最后必须要如此解决：一劳永勉地扫除通过希特勒与莫索里尼联合努力而建立的政权，它再存在下去就危害世界的和平与民主。
