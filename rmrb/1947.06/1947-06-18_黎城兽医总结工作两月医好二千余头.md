　　[This newspaper Licheng news] Licheng recently convened its third veterinary meeting to exchange experiences and summarize the work since the last meeting. Since personally going to the countryside, the results have been great. Due to timely treatment, the livestock mortality rate has been reduced, and the masses' tendency to delay treatment due to not being able to find a doctor has been overcome. Fifteen people (excluding doctors who have not joined the organization) have treated more than 2,600 head of livestock in two months. The meeting determined specific plans for future veterinary work: 1. Each veterinarian will participate in the district and village cooperatives to look after livestock diseases. 2. Veterinarians will be responsible for treating livestock diseases in the villages where they are stationed. 3. If livestock diseases are discovered in various places in the future, veterinarians will be immediately organized to go to the countryside in a planned manner. (Construction Department)

　　黎城兽医总结工作两月医好二千余头
    【本报黎城讯】黎城近召开第三次兽医会，交流经验，总结上次会以来的工作，自亲自下乡以来，收效很大，因医治及时，减低了牲畜死亡率，克服了群众因找不到医生而迁延待日不看，十五人（未参加组织的医生除外）在两月中计治好牲口二千六百余头。会上确定今后兽医工作具体计划：一、各个兽医参加区村合作社看牲畜病。二、兽医在驻地村负责治疗附近牲畜病。三、如今后各地再发现牲畜病，即时组织兽医有计划分头下乡。（建设科）
