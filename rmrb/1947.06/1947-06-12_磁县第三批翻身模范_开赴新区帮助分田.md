　　[Reported by our correspondent in Cixian] To help the masses in the newly liberated areas achieve emancipation, the first and second batches of emancipation teams from Cixian County had already departed for Qixian and Tangyin counties. On the 1st of this month, the government called for the dispatch of the third batch of emancipation teams. Upon hearing this news, the emancipation models from various districts voluntarily signed up. After the leadership reported on the current situation and several issues to be noted in the work, everyone was allowed to discuss collectively. During the discussion, it was unanimously agreed that "peasants all over the world are one family" and "do not forget those who have not yet been emancipated after one's own emancipation." For example, Shen Fuzhi from Liu Si Gou Village said: "I saw in the front lines of the war that the masses in the Chiang Kai-shek controlled areas had nothing to eat, wear, or burn, and their lives were very difficult. The landlords were still flaunting their power and oppressing the masses in the villages. Therefore, I want to go and help them achieve emancipation and liberation like I did." Suo Guanghua from Liangjia Village said: "I worked as a farmhand for fourteen years and tasted too much of the bitterness of being poor. Now that I am emancipated, the people of Andong have not yet been emancipated. To help them achieve emancipation quickly, I have already mobilized my relatives and wife to do the work at home, and I am willing to go and vow not to return until I have helped them achieve emancipation." Wang Taiquan from Suojing said: "I was cutting wheat in the field when I heard about helping the masses achieve emancipation. I ran over without finishing the harvest." Li Xianzhi, Wei Wuzhuang, and Li Yongfu from Shuangmiao were not even called by the district, but they ran over insisting on going. Li Youquan and five others from Shiqiao Village, because they received the letter late, were afraid of missing the event, and traveled all night to the gathering place without sleeping. After the discussion, the ninety-two armed emancipation team members set off excitedly and happily.

　　磁县第三批翻身模范
    开赴新区帮助分田
    【本报磁县讯】磁县为了帮助新区群众翻身，第一二批翻身队，早已开赴淇县、汤阴，本月一日，政府号召第三批翻身队出动，各区翻身模范听到这个消息后均自动报名前去，领导上向大家作了目前形势报告和工作中应注意的几个问题后，让大家集体讨论，讨论中一致认为“天下农民是一家”，“自己翻了身不忘别人没翻身”。如：刘汜沟村申福志说：“我在前方参战，见到蒋官区的群众没吃，没穿，没烧，生活十分困难，地主还在村上耀武扬威欺压群众，所以我要去帮助他们和我一样的翻身解放”。梁家庄索广华说：“我住了十四年长工，贫人滋味尝的太多了，我现在翻了身，安东老百姓还没翻身，为了帮助他们很快翻身，家里的活计我已动员好亲威妻子去干，自愿前去，不帮助他们翻了身誓不回还。”索井王太全说：“我正在地里割麦，听说帮助群众翻身，未待割完就跑来了，”双庙李献智韦武装李永付，区上根本没调他，跑来非去不行，石桥村李友全等六人因接的信晚，怕误了事，一夜未睡连夜赶到集合地。讨论结束后，九十二名武装翻身队兴奋愉快的出发了。
