　　Genzheng picked up the newly made satchel, carefully blowing the dust stuck to the embroidery, and gently patting it with his hand. At that moment, his wife, Aixiang, ran in. As soon as she entered, she saw her husband cherishing the satchel she had made for him. She initially wanted to laugh, but she was too anxious to laugh, so she leaned close to her husband's ear and said:
　　"Didn't you say that the second son wasn't going to go? Look at him, his trouser legs are properly tied, and he's even draped the quilt over a wooden stick..."
　　"I'll go take a look," Genzheng said, putting the satchel on the bed. "It was decided yesterday that he would stay, and I would go. Humph! He's really naughty!"
　　Before he could step out of the door, Aixiang grabbed him and said softly, "Let your second brother go this time! In the future, you can always..."
　　"I'm the village's militia committee director! If we don't take the lead ourselves, who will go!" Genzheng tried to break free from his wife's grip.
　　Aixiang added, "I'm also a member of the Women's Rescue Association. It's not that we don't want you to go, it's just that we're afraid you brothers will have another conflict over enlisting!"
　　Today was "March 8th" Women's Day. A strong wind started blowing before dawn, but the village's musical band was already playing and drumming in the wind early in the morning. They were notified last night to hold a meeting this morning, and it was already after breakfast, so Genzheng and Aixiang were extremely anxious. They walked out of the house in a hurry and went to see his second brother in the north room. From a distance of ten feet away from the north room, they saw the second brother wearing a pair of new shoes for the road, with his headscarf tied more neatly than last time. His trouser legs were tied tightly, and the quilt was folded into a long strip draped over a stick. He rushed out of the house in a fluster. When he suddenly saw his elder brother and sister-in-law, he immediately turned his head away, facing the door, without saying a word. Genzheng grabbed his brother's shoulder and urgently tried to reason with him: "Didn't we agree yesterday that you are still young and shouldn't go now? It won't be too late to enlist in a couple of years!" The second brother had been secretly planning to sign up for the army, hiding it from the elders and his brother and sister-in-law. It was unfortunate that he ran into them before he even left the house, so he was really unhappy. No matter what his brother said, he always faced the door with the quilt on his shoulder, not turning around or answering.
　　The second brother is seventeen this year, named Genyi, and he is the village's youth captain. He knew that their Gao family had been working as hired laborers for landlords for generations. In famine years, when he was only twelve or thirteen, he saw his father kowtowing dozens of times to the merciless landlord, who wouldn't even lend them three sheng of grain, resulting in his mother starving to death. He cried for years, and his heart was filled with hatred! It wasn't until the Eighth Route Army came that they had a few good days. During the year when the poor people turned the tables, he and his brother had always been active, doing everything first, making those rich people bow their heads and call them "father." Poor folks were no longer controlled by the landlords, and every family was allocated ten or eight mu of land. Everyone said that they were model brothers. This time, because of the competition to enlist, the brothers had already argued several times, their faces red. Today, when his brother used other reasons to persuade him, he had nothing to say, so he simply didn't answer. But when his brother mentioned that the militia committee director should take the lead, he exploded and immediately turned around to argue: "If you militia committee director wants to take the lead, we youth captains have no face! Shouldn't we take the lead!"
　　Genzheng had no words to convince his second brother. Watching the sun climb over the wall, and the wind and the musical band playing and drumming made people's hearts panic, he kept blowing air out of his mouth, stamping his feet in anxiety. At that moment, Aixiang stepped forward again and said, "I say, brother, you're only seventeen, and you're not married yet. Stay at home! Let your brother go if he wants to, what's the point of arguing over this!"
　　"It's precisely because I'm not married that I don't miss home! And there's no one dragging me down, so of course I should go..."
　　As soon as the second brother said this, Aixiang's neck immediately turned red. She glanced at her husband, pouting her lips, and turned to leave.
　　No one had anything to say. The shadows of the trees cast from outside the wall fell in the courtyard, drawing large circles along with the raging wind. Both brothers were extremely anxious, but neither had a good way to get away.
　　"Genzheng, are you ready? Everyone has gathered at the headquarters, waiting to send you off!" It was their father returning, calling out to Genzheng from outside the door.
　　Upon seeing their father, the brothers rushed forward to argue; you said you should go, I said I want to take the lead. After arguing for a long time, they still couldn't resolve the issue. The father's eyes, which had already lost their luster, were now filled with joyful tears, shouting to his two sons: "Genzheng, Genyi, you brothers should go together! I—we—the Gao family has produced—two heroes—" He was so excited that he was panting and coughing. After a fit of coughing, he grabbed them and said: "I've lived for over sixty years, and I've never lived in such a good world as our liberated area; go and resist that old world; defeat...Old Chiang...and then come back!" After speaking, he had another fit of coughing.
　　The wind stopped blowing, and the shadows of the trees were only gently swaying. Aixiang brought Genzheng's bedding, satchel, and grenade pouch into the courtyard all at once. The father retreated to the stone next to the manure pile and sat down, each coughing his cough. Genzheng quickly said to Aixiang, "The problem is solved." The second brother, triumphantly hooking his sister-in-law's arm, interrupted his brother's words and said, "Sister-in-law, you see, I was right!"
　　The sister-in-law deliberately changed the subject from the brothers' conversation, asking: "Are you just going to enlist like this? No satchel, no grenade pouch?"
　　Genzheng took the things from Aixiang's hand and looked at the satchel and grenade pouch back and forth several times. Finally, he handed the grenade pouch to the second brother, saying: "Use this!"
　　The second brother pursed his lips, stole a glance at the embroidered satchel in his brother's hand, and casually brushed the grenade pouch onto the ground, muttering, "I don't want it."
　　Everyone understood what the second brother meant, but none of them spoke. Eventually, Genzheng cast a glance at his wife, then nodded towards the second brother, while shaking the satchel in his hand, as if asking if he should give it to him. Aixiang, arranging her hair, just smiled without saying a word. Genzheng knew that his wife wouldn't have any objections, so he walked over, hung the satchel on the second brother's shoulder, and said with a smile: "This is for you, I'll be fine with the grenade pouch." The second brother compared the position of the satchel hanging on his shoulder, looking at his brother and sister-in-law, smiling embarrassedly.
　　At this moment, there were hurried footsteps on the dirt road outside the door, followed by two women running in. They were Xuehua and Xiaoyu. Both of them were active members of the Women's Rescue Association. Xuehua still had her old habit, swaying her body as she walked, and floated to the Gao brothers' family as soon as she entered the door. However, Xiaoyu seemed a little different today, her face gloomy, and her footsteps not as quick as usual. They were sent by the village chief to invite the new soldiers who were enlisting to go to the meeting. Aixiang was about to come over and greet them, but Xuehua had already grabbed the satchel on Genyi's body, laughing non-stop, saying: "Not bad at all, it's even embroidered with flowers!"
　　"He's enlisting! He'd even complain if he didn't have embroidered things!"
　　His sister-in-law added those two sentences, Genyi felt his face burning, turned his back, and didn't look at them for a long time.
　　"Oh, come quickly! We still have to go to the east end to call Old Li!" Xuehua was busy as if something urgent was happening, and turned around to pull Xiaoyu away. But Xiaoyu didn't seem to want to leave, saying: "You go alone, I'll follow them to the meeting place." (To be continued)

　　参军
    古今
    根正拿起新挂包，小心地吹那粘在绣花上的土，又用手不住的轻轻拍打，这会，他妻子爱香就跑进来了。一进门，瞧见丈夫那样爱惜她给做的挂包，本来想笑，可是心里急的了不得，没顾上笑，就凑上男人的耳朵边说：
    “你们说，不是不让老二去吗？你看他，裤腿扎得好好的，还把被子往木棍上搭咧…………。”
    “我去看。”根正把挂包往炕上一撂，边走边说：“昨天就说好了他留下，我去。哼！真淘气死啦！”
    还没跨出门口，爱香就一把＠住他，轻轻说：“这回就让你老二去吧！往后你再…………。”
    “我是村上的武委会主任呀！咱自己不带头，叫谁去呀！”根正想挣脱妻子拉住的手。
    爱香又说：“咱也是妇救会员，不是不叫你去，是怕你们弟兄两个，又为参军闹那个冲突！”
    今天是“三八”妇女节，天不亮便刮开了大风，村上的八音乐队，却老早就在风声中吹，在风声中敲了。昨天夜里通知今儿前晌开会，现在已是早饭以后的时候了，所以根正和爱香都急得不行，三步合成两步走出房门，一齐向北屋去看他家老二。离北屋丈把远，见老二穿一对上路的新鞋，头上的手巾比那回也缠的齐整，裤腿扎得紧紧的，被子叠成长条挑在棍子上，慌忙地从屋子里冲出来。猛见他哥哥和他嫂子，便一下扭过头去，对着屋门，不说一句话。根正抓住他兄弟的肩膀，急着给讲道理：“不是昨天早说好了！你年纪还小，现时不去，过二年参军也不迟呀！”那老二本是瞒着老人和哥嫂，想偷偷去报名参军的。可巧还没出门就碰着他们，心里着实不痛快，所以任他哥哥怎说，他总是把挑着的被子对着屋门，不回头，也不答话。
    老二今年十七啦，叫个根义，是村上的青年队长。他知道他们高家，是几辈子给人家地主当雇工。灾荒年，他才十二、三咧，瞧见爹跟人家磕了几十个响头，那个恶霸地主三升粮也不肯借，结果把娘也给饿死了。他一直哭了几年，心上就是有仇哩！八路军来了，才算过了几天好光景。年时穷人闹翻身，他和他哥哥一直是积极的，啥事都做在头前，斗得那些富人低头喊老子，穷爷们从此再不受地主那个制，谁家也分得了十来八亩地，大伙都说他们弟兄是模范。这回因为争着参军，他们弟兄已经红着脸吵了几回了。今天他哥哥用其他的理由来说他，他也没个说的，只好不答话。可是当哥哥提到武委会主任应当带头的那会，他就炸了，立刻扭过来争辩：“你们武委会主任要带头，我们青年队长没面子，就不该带头！”
    根正没有话能说服他家老二。看着太阳爬过了墙头，风和八音乐队又吹打得人心慌，他嘴里一直吹气，急的老跺脚。这会，爱香又上前来说了：“我说兄弟，你才十七哩，还没娶亲，在家吧！你哥哥要去就让他去，这些闲气有个啥争头！”
    “没结婚才不念家哩，又没有人拖尾巴，当然该我去……”
    老二这一说，爱香立刻红了脖子，向她丈夫了一眼，鼓嘟着嘴，转身就走。
    谁都没有话说了。在墙外射过来的树影投在院里，跟着狂风一齐在画着大圈子；弟兄俩个心上都急得不行，但谁也没个好法子能够走开。
    “根正，收拾好了没有？人家全集合到了指挥部，等着欢送你们哩！”是爹回来了，在门外就叫着根正。
    见了爹，弟兄俩一齐赶上去争吵；你说你该去，我说我要带头，闹了老半天，依然不得解决。当爹的已经失去了光彩的眼睛，这会又喜得转着满腔热泪，喊着俩个孩儿：“根正、根义，你们弟兄俩一齐去吧！我——我们——高家出了——你们两个好汉——”他兴奋得直喘气，咳嗽一阵，又拉住他们说道：“我活了六十多了，就没过过咱解放区这个好世道；快去抵住那旧世道；打垮了……老蒋………再回来！”说完，又是一阵咳嗽。
    狂风不刮了，树影也只是轻轻的摇。爱香把根正的被褥、挂包、装手榴弹的口袋，一齐抱到院子里来，爹便退到粪堆旁边的石头上坐下，各自咳他的嗽。根正赶快给爱香说：“问题解决了”。老二得意的拐着他嫂子的臂膊，打断哥哥的话说：“嫂，你看，还是我说的对！”
    嫂子故意岔开兄弟这话，问道：“就这样去参军？没个挂包，也没个装手榴弹的？”
    根正接过爱香手里的东西，把挂包和手榴弹袋来回看了好几遍，终于把手榴弹袋递给老二，说：“这个给你使吧！”
    老二撅起嘴唇，偷看一下哥哥手里的绣花挂包，随手便把手榴弹袋拂在地上，嘟嚷着说：“我不要。”
    大家都了解老二的心眼，但可都没有说话。赶后，还是根正向妻子投了个眼色，又向老二那边努一努嘴，同时抖了抖手中的挂包，意思是问给他不给？爱香理着自己的头发，只管笑，不做声。根正知道妻子不会有意见，又走过去，将挂包挂在老二肩上，笑着说：“这个就给你，我要手榴弹袋好了。”老二前后左右比着挂包挂的地位，对着哥嫂，怪不好意思的笑了。
    这时候，门外有急燥的脚步踏着土路，跟着跑进来两个妇女，一看是雪花和小鱼。她们两个都是妇救会的积极分子。雪花还是那个旧脾气，走起路来不住的摇着身子，一进门便飘到高家弟兄一家人面前；可是小鱼今天倒像有些不同，脸色阴沉沉的，脚步也不及往常踮的快。他们两个，是村长叫来请参军的新战士去开会的。爱香正要过来和她们招呼，雪花却已经扯住了根义身上的挂包，笑个不住的说：“真不赖，还绣了花哩！”
    “人家参军啦！没绣花的物件，还嫌不好哩！”
    他嫂子这样补充两句，根义就觉得脸上烧热，扭着背过去，好久不看她们。
    “哦，快来吧！我们还得到东头叫老李去！”雪花忙得什么似的，转过来就想拉着小鱼飘走。可是小鱼要走不走的，却说：“你一个去吧，我随他们到会场来。”（未完）
