　　On the Way to the Front Lines
　　Zhang Qing
　　This time, I took a trip to the front lines for some business, and the tense and active atmosphere of wartime that I saw along the way left me with a very deep impression.
　　On the way to Guantai, on the winding road between the undulating mountains, layers of dust flew up, and donkeys, carrying poles, and stretchers filled the road; young men wearing khaki-colored cloth uniforms, with hand grenades hanging from their waists, and rifles on their shoulders, strode to the front lines, heroic and high-spirited, with a kind of handsome spirit hidden between their brows. I deliberately asked a young man walking beside me:
　　"Where are you all going?"
　　"To the front line!" He didn't even turn his head, shrugged his shoulders, and raised his head to answer me:
　　"You haven't fought a war, aren't you afraid to go to the front line?" I asked another question immediately. But he didn't answer me, just smiled and strode away. Suddenly, another one rushed up from behind and said to me: "Comrade! You probably haven't been to the battlefield, have you? Our militia is really capable! Don't you see that they haven't received formal military training, but it's no problem to fight against Old Chiang, and if we surround Old Chiang's army, we'll guarantee that he won't be able to escape!"
　　That afternoon, around four or five o'clock, we arrived at Guantai. At the fork in the road at the edge of the village, there was a brick chimney built, emitting wisps of black smoke, with four large iron pots sitting around it. This was to provide water for wounded comrades and military and political personnel coming and going. I walked closer to the pot, just about to sit down, when two children suddenly flashed out from the side, held out the machetes they were carrying, and stood in front of me:
　　"Comrade, road pass!" Their loud voices almost startled me. After checking it, they said very politely:
　　"Have some water!" After saying that, they turned and ran away.
　　In the evening, we stayed overnight in Guantai, and saw several wounded soldiers lying horizontally among the crowd outside the door of the reception station, with seven or eight young women busy attending to them. They gave the wounded soldiers water, washed their faces, and fed them eggs, carefully serving the soldiers who had shed blood for the people.
　　A wounded comrade in front of me, sitting on a stretcher, leaned in a woman's arms. She used her hand to support his injured head wrapped in bandages, gently placing it on her chest, and the other hand fed him a bowl of noodle soup that another woman was holding. She fed him carefully, wiping the soup dripping on his face with her own handkerchief; and constantly asking:
　　"Comrade, is it too hot? Is it too bland? Drink some more!"
　　"It's okay, I'll drink it with a spoon myself; you don't need to ......" A soft, weak voice came from the woman's chest.
　　I stood quietly on the side watching them, for a long, long time, I didn't say a word, afraid of disturbing them. My heart was completely submerged in this solemn people's emotion.

　　到前线的路上
    张卿
    这次因为一些事情到前方跑了一趟，沿途所见那种战时的紧张、活跃的气象，给我留下了非常深刻的印象。
    在赴观台途中，在起伏山峦间的蜿蜒汽路上，飞起了层层的尘土，毛驴、扁担、担架塞满了道路；身穿土色布单衣、腰悬手榴弹、扛着步枪的青年们，大踏步的奔赴前线，雄纠纠，气昂昂，一种英俊的气概，隐伏于眉宇之间。我故意向走在我身旁的一位青年问道：
    “你们这些人都是到那里去的？”
    “上火线！”他连头也不回，耸了一下肩，扬着头这样回答了我一句：
    “你们没打过仗，到火线上不害怕么？”我紧接着又问了一句。可是他却没有回答我，只是笑了一笑，就迈开大步走过去了。突然从后面抢过来另一个对我说：“同志！你大概没上过战场吧？咱们的民兵可行啦！你不看没受过正式的军队训练，打老蒋可不成问题，包围起老蒋的军队，保管跑不了他一个！”
    这天的下午，约四五点钟光景，我们到了观台。在村边的岔道口，修得有一个砖砌的烟囱，冒出缕缕的黑烟，四面座着四口大铁锅，这是招待伤员同志及来往军政人员喝水的。我走近锅旁，正欲坐下，旁边突然闪出两个儿童，将手里提着的砍刀一顺，站在我的面前：
    “同志，路条！”他们的响亮的声音，几乎把我吓了一跳。查过以后，很客气地说：
    “你喝水吧！”说完他们一转身就跑开了。
    晚上，我们在观台住宿，看见招待站的门外，在人丛中横躺着几个伤员，七八个青年妇女正忙着招待。她们给伤员们喂水、洗脸、喂鸡蛋，小心地服侍着为人民流了血的战士。
    在我面前的一个负伤同志，他坐在担架上靠在一个妇女的怀中，她用手托着那缠满绷带的受伤的头部，轻轻地放在自己的胸口上，另一只手喂着另一个妇女端的一碗挂面汤。她小心地喂着，用自己的手巾拭着滴在脸上的面汤；一面还不断地问着：
    “同志，太热吗？淡不淡？你多喝些！”
    “可以，我自己拿匙子喝吧；你不………”从那个妇女的胸前发出了轻轻的微弱的声音。
    我静静地站在一旁看着他们，很久很久，我没有说一句话，怕打扰了他们。我的心完全沉没在这庄严的人民的感情里面。
