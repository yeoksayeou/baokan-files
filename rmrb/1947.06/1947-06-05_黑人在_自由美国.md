　　Blacks in "Free America"
　　爱伦堡 (Ilya Ehrenburg)
　　I often run from downtown New York City to Harlem—the city of blacks, the black district. It's quite dirty and poor there, and there's little of the magnificent American technology. But the people there are happier, simpler, and more humane; the crowds on the streets of Harlem resemble those in a southern European port. Blacks live in Harlem because other areas won't rent them houses, and the rent for slums in Harlem is more expensive than houses near the street in other areas. Every morning, they go to work in the "white" areas. They work as cleaners and elevator operators, messengers and furnace stokers, guards and plasterers. They are black, so their jobs are also black. They are exploited, abused, and ridiculed.
　　In theory, racial equality exists in New York. Blacks are not allowed to be driven out of restaurants, but they are told, "Please leave, because you are black." Or they might say, "Fully seated," even though all the seats are empty. Laws are laws, and no fancy American restaurant allows blacks to enter. I wanted to invite two black friends—a journalist and a musician—to my residence. I lived on the fourth floor of a hotel, and people warned me in advance that blacks were not allowed on the elevator, saying it would break down...
　　I became friends with blacks. They possess not only many genuine qualities of kindness, but they are also people with artistic talents, which I cherish most. There are countless wonders in America; it has everything, including art! There are the most luxurious museums, the largest symphony orchestras, and the most massive literary publishing houses. But in New York, one often feels a loneliness gnawing at the heart... I am reminded of Hans Christian Andersen's beautiful fairy tale of the Chinese Emperor and the Nightingale: someone presented the Emperor with a toy with screws—a mechanical nightingale. It could sing just like a real one, and it was always obedient, singing not when it wanted to, but when it was wound up. But then death came, standing over the head of this lonely man. The Emperor wanted to suppress the death-inducing sound, and he cautiously demanded of the mechanical nightingale, "Sing!" But the mechanism broke. The living nightingale saved the Emperor; it had long been banished from the Imperial Garden. Blacks are America's living nightingales. When I long for art, I run to the plague-ridden district of Harlem. Blacks are excellent musicians, excellent singers, excellent dancers, excellent actors; they are endowed with a high sense of rhythm, and there is no mechanicalness in them. When they play, it is as if a specter has risen from a coffin. Their songs are mournful, like their fate, but suddenly a childlike smile breaks through the sorrow, and then life anywhere else would not be as pleasant, as joyous as in the Harlem slum.
　　In downtown New York, some theaters have black groups performing. They perform extremely well, and even white people are happy to applaud them. But if a black actor wants to have a snack in the restaurant next door, he will be quietly asked to leave. New York has not yet tasted the Emperor's unbearable loneliness, and the living nightingale is still in exile...
　　In the State Department, they asked us which part of America we wanted to visit. The writer Simonov said he was interested in film and wanted to go to Hollywood. One of the largest newspapers invited Galaktionov to Chicago. When I said "the American South," the Americans fell silent, and then objected, "It's too far, and not comfortable enough there." I replied, "From Moscow to Washington is farther than from Washington to Mississippi. I am a war correspondent, used to living in earthen houses and bunkers, and I am not afraid of lacking comfortable conditions. The reason I want to see the American South is because blacks appealed to me from the start, and because I remember the books about the misfortune of blacks that I read in my childhood, and because I love to read the novels of modern American writers Faulkner and Steinbeck, who specialize in writing about the American South."
　　A Southerner—the son of a naval admiral, the left-wing journalist Gilmore—agreed to take me to South America. He had a good "Buick" car and several weeks of free time. We spoke to each other in French. The State Department sent Mr. Nelson, the editor of "America" magazine, to accompany us. I spoke to him in Russian. Along the way, one of New York's most famous journalists, Sim Graftan, joined our group; he wanted to write some sketches about the meeting between Soviet writers and slave owners in South America. I spoke to Graftan in German. Nelson had never been to the South, and his surprise at everything we saw was no less than mine. When Graftan entered a small house where a black family of three was huddled together, he exclaimed, "I didn't expect it to be like this...". I told him at the time, "Uncle Sam has finally met Uncle Tom." (Note)
　　The train, comfortable half-empty carriages; white people drinking whiskey and dozing off. A carriage full of black people, pouring rain, a train station, the vehicle arrived, it was empty, but the black women with children remained in place in the rain: the seats reserved for blacks were full. A sign at the park entrance read: "Colored people are not allowed to enter." Shoe store—blacks are not allowed to try on leather shoes, leather shoes tried on by blacks cannot be sold to white people. How many times did Americans tell me about their freedom: freedom of the press, freedom of conscience, freedom of movement, what a pity! They forgot one freedom—the freedom to try on shoes...
　　All Southern provinces have "racial segregation" laws. Racial discrimination here is not a custom, but a national law. Blacks do not have the right to attend white people's gatherings, and dare not enter churches where white people pray. Naturally, they should not even dream of entering white people's theaters and cinemas.
　　I traveled through four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. I saw many beautiful sights; I saw the architecture of the Tennessee Valley, where magnificent cities with comfortable villas have risen in this valley, I saw the old customs of New Orleans, I saw mountains, I saw great rivers, I saw the blue of the Gulf of Mexico. But with every step, I saw the thing I feared most: people insulting people. In South America as in North America, there are magnificent stations. I wanted to praise this country that has made so many facilities for the fatigue of easy working days, but I cannot praise it: in every magnificent station, I saw smelly, dark, small huts with signs that read "For Colored People Only." A cotton planting master invited us. He lived in a good house, surrounded by old trees. He had a wife—fair and well-dressed, and children—well-dressed and fair. Sweating black slaves were working all around. In the home of this planter were all the wonders of America—from a powerful radio that could receive broadcasts from Tashkent, Melbourne, and Andorra, to an electric fan. I spoke of the suffering of blacks. The planter replied with a smile that blacks could not be treated like human beings, "they are more like beasts." Neither the radio nor the electric fan had the slightest impact on the intellectual development of this slave owner. When I came out of his place, I said to my companions, "This is not a human being, but rather a beast."
　　The Mississippi Delta is a cotton farm, the land belongs to white people, who rent it to blacks. The "tenants" should pay half of the cotton harvest to the landlord, and they should sell the remaining half to him, and the cotton price is stipulated by the landlord, and the meager part that the blacks get, they have to exchange for daily necessities in the store belonging to the same owner. Perhaps to American lawyers, this is a tenancy system, but in reality, it is slavery. I saw the owners of the land, who are also the buyers of cotton, and they are also merchants who sell shoes, kerosene, and salt. I was reminded of the pictures once pasted on cigarette boxes: slave owners holding whips and black women mottled in the fields... This slave owner in front of me often shouted to the old black man: "Hey, John, hurry up!..."
　　I walked into a slum where twenty-three people were crammed into it: men and women sleeping together. Oh, how far away this is from the famous American technology, from artificial air conditioning and super comfortable facilities! It was simply impossible to breathe here, only rags and stench. In the most "hygienic" America, people live like animals. A black woman told me that her sister died giving birth; her husband couldn't call a doctor, he only earned one hundred and eighty dollars a year, and the medical expenses would require sixty dollars. I saw one family of seven who only earned a total of three hundred dollars a year; and another family of four who earned two hundred dollars a year. And a farm owner, considered a small farmer, complained that last year was unlucky. I asked him how much money he earned last year, and he replied: "Very little—only twenty-five thousand dollars in total."
　　A Louisiana slave owner explained to me: "You don't understand blacks: they live as if they are in paradise, because they don't need anything more." There are no schools on the farms, but churches with black pastors are built for blacks. White-haired black old men, about to die from overwork, sing hymns. A black man said to me: "I believe that there are also two paradises in the afterlife—one for white people and one for black people—and the black people's paradise is not bad...." He could not imagine a paradise without racial distinction.
　　My companions—Nelson, Gilmore, and Graftan—were silent and sullen. And the slave owner said awkwardly: "Please eat walnuts. Drink whiskey. It's great that Russian guests have come to us. There is also cotton in Russia..." I looked at the yellow river water, at the vast Mississippi, and I knew what human misfortune was. I could not find a word to say all the time I was walking on the banks of this river. I was ashamed to look at people.
　　In recent years, South America has changed, and industrial cities have grown up. But to Weinstein or Natchez, it is still paternalism and romance. Birmingham is already like an industrial center in the north, with huge hardware factories and modern equipment. There are many blacks among the workers. Here you are as if in a cotton farm, the American South has mixed ultramodern lathes with ancient slaves. In the factory, blacks do the heaviest work, they are not allowed to be steelmakers, mechanics, or electricians, and black coolies earn fifteen cents less per hour than white coolies.
　　According to the American Constitution, all male and female citizens, regardless of race, have the right to participate in elections. But in the Southern states, blacks are deprived of the right to vote. In Alabama, there is a population of three million, of which one million and one hundred thousand are black. Among the voters in the state, four hundred and ninety-six thousand are white, and four thousand are black. In Birmingham, there are one hundred and thirty thousand blacks who are twenty-one years old, and there are only one thousand four hundred blacks in the voter register, one out of ten blacks is allowed to vote. In Mississippi, blacks account for half of the population, and half of the state's population is deprived of the right to vote.
　　How do the Southern states deal with the federal constitution? There are many methods. First, collect taxes from voters. The blacks in South America are a group of extremely poor people, a few dollars seem rich to them. A black man asked us to take him to a certain northern state, he imagined Harlem like imagining paradise for many years, he knew he would never save enough money for a ticket. How could he pay the voting tax? In addition to taxes, there are also exams: voters should "understand and be able to explain the constitution." Needless to say, the "examiners" who believe in racism want to brush off all blacks. It is said that when a black professor was "tested," people presented various documents and asked him to "explain." Finally, the "examiner" gave him a Chinese newspaper (Chinese is the most difficult language to understand, he wanted to unreasonably deprive the black professor of the right to vote by this. - Editor): "Do you understand what is written here?" This professor had not studied Chinese, and he replied: "I understand, it is written here that you will never allow blacks to go to the ballot box!" Also, even if the black man pays the tax and "passes" the exam, then the slave boss will use a pretty good little stick to teach this unwelcome voter a lesson. Yes, in South America they know how to "explain" the constitution!
　　I remembered how indignant some American newspapers were at the Yugoslavs: the People's Front government deprived the people who helped the German occupiers of the right to vote, almost two hundred thousand people were wiped off the voter register. American newspapers protested: "What is this called universal suffrage?" The same Americans believe that it is extremely natural to deprive millions of American blacks (some of whom fought for America's freedom) of the right to vote. I have to ask the United States: is it fair to deprive people of black conscience of the right to vote, or is it fair to deprive people of black skin of the right to vote?
　　Supporters of racial discrimination say: "You can't talk about equal rights with blacks, because blacks have lost their culture." Indeed, racists use all means to make blacks lose the opportunity to be educated. Nelson told me a lot about the facilities for people's education in New York: "All Americans who are sixteen years old go to school..." In Mississippi, he no longer talked about people's education, we saw many illiterate teenagers, we saw black children who had never seen a school, they only knew one thing since childhood—hard labor.
　　But it cannot be said that slave owners are supporters of white culture: they generally prefer to choose whips rather than elementary textbooks. In Mississippi, teachers are beggars: their annual salary is six hundred dollars. As for the black-skinned teachers who teach blacks, they are not only beggars, but they also have to be humble in front of white people. When a white supervisor goes to a black school, he calls the teacher by his first name: "Hey, Bill! ... Hey, John! ..." Even if the supervisor is twenty-five years old and the teacher is fifty years old, the teacher should still respectfully answer the white man: "I obey you, Mr. Smith."...
　　For example, in Alabama, the funds allocated to public education are all distributed to white people. In order to clear their conscience, a black professor was called in to explain to him: "The budget is limited, the money has already been spent, you have to find your own way..." This black man replied very well: "You are right—white people need education more here."
　　I met many educated blacks in the American South—scholars, writers, doctors, teachers, lawyers. These educated blacks are like brilliant spots against the background of this white savage South with too many degrees. I have been to black newspapers, where enthusiasts threatened with punishment are insisting on human rights every minute.
　　There are seven hundred students in the private Fisk University: black men and women. They are future doctors, teachers, lawyers, but they can only treat black people, can only teach black children, and can only appear in court when interrogating "colored people." Black professors are not allowed to enter the public library. Professor Bredy, a famous chemist, told me that he could not work in the laboratory of a national university. I spent a few wonderful hours at Fisk University: I saw young people seeking truth. There was a female student there who could speak Russian—half Russian: her mother was from Odessa, and her father was black. She had a fair face that did not look like a black woman, but her passport stated "colored person," thus closing all doors to her.
　　In New Orleans, I met a civil engineer, he was a man with a jujube-red face and freckles. He seemed to be a pleasant talker, and his erudition surprised me. I asked him to sit in a cafe, he refused, without explaining the reason. Later, a friend explained to me that the whole city knew he was a "colored person," so he had no right to enter the cafe.
　　Newspaper publishers with clever wrists print a few columns of black people's pages, white people do not look at these columns. If a white man opens a black newspaper on the street, he will be beaten or insulted. If a white man in the American South publicly declares that blacks are also human beings like white people, he will be killed.
　　(Note) Europeans call American white people Uncle Sam, and black people Uncle Tom.

### 黑人在“自由美国”

　　黑人在“自由美国”
    爱伦堡
    我常常从纽约市中心跑到加尔莱姆——这是黑人的城市，黑人区。那儿相当肮脏、穷苦，那儿很少宏壮的美国技术。但那儿的人们却更快乐些，更纯朴些，更人性些；加尔莱姆街道上的人群好像南欧港口的人群。黑人住在加尔莱姆，因为别的区域不租给他们房子，而在加尔莱姆的贫民窟比别的区里近街道的房子租金还要贵，他们每天早晨到“白”区里工作。他们做清道夫和电梯掌管者、信差和暖炉师、看守人和泥水匠。他们是黑色的，所以做的工作也是黑色的。他们被夺取，被虐待，被嘲弄。
    在理论上，纽约是存在着人种平等。不许从饭店里把黑人撵出去，而是对他说：“请您走吧，因为您是黑人。”也可以说：“座满”，虽然甚至所有的座位都是空着的。法律是法律，没有一家排场的美国饭馆是准许黑人进去的。我想邀请两个黑人朋友——新闻记者和音乐家——来我的住处。我住在旅馆的四层楼上，人们预先提醒我，不准黑人上电梯，说是电梯会损坏的。………
    我同黑人交起朋友来了。在他们身上不唯有着许多由衷的善良的品质，而且他们是一些具有艺术才力的人们，这是我所最珍贵的。在美国有无数的奇迹；这儿有着一切，其中也有艺术！有最豪华的博物馆，有最大的交响乐队，最巨大的文艺出版所。但在纽约常常感到寂寞咀嚼着心……我想起了安徒生讲中国皇帝与夜莺的美妙的童话：有人献给皇上一个带螺丝的玩具——机械夜莺。它能唱得跟真的一样，而且它总是驯服的，不是它愿意的时候，而是机械上了劲的时候唱歌，但是死神来临了，（她死神）站在这个孤家寡人的头上面，皇帝想压息她催死的声音，他小心翼翼地对机械夜莺要求道：“你唱吧！”但是机械损坏了。活的夜莺救了皇帝，它是早被皇帝撵出御园之外的。黑人是美国的活夜莺。当我渴想艺术时，我便跑到有瘟疫病的加尔莱姆区。黑人是优秀的音乐家，优秀的歌唱家，优秀的舞蹈家，优秀的演员；他们天赋着高度的节凑的感觉，在他们身上没有机械性。当他们演奏起来，仿佛一个幻灵从棺里站了起来。他们的歌曲是忧伤的，像是他们的命运一样，但突然孩提的微笑冲破了悲怨，那么任何地方的生活都不会像加尔莱姆贫民窟这儿的这样愉快，这样欢乐。
    在纽约的市中心有些剧院是有黑人组在那儿演奏的。他们演奏得极好，连白人也乐意向他们喝彩。但如果黑人演员想在隔壁的饭馆小吃一下，那么他便会安安静静地被人请出饭馆外边来。纽约还没有尝过皇帝的难以消受的孤寂，活的夜莺仍在放逐中………
    在国务院里问我们想参观美国那一部分。作家西蒙诺夫说他对电影有兴趣，他愿意到好莱坞。一家最大的报馆邀请加拉克乔诺夫到芝加哥。当我说出“到美国南部”这句话时，美国人默然了，然后便反对我道：“这太远啦，而且那儿不够舒服的。”我回答：“从莫斯科到华盛顿总比从华盛顿到密士什比州远些，我是一个战地记者，在过惯土屋和掩蔽部的生活后，不怕缺乏舒适的条件的。我之所以想看看美国南部的原故，是因为黑人一开始就投合了我的脾味，又因为记起了我童年时代所读的讲黑人的不幸的书，又因为我爱读专写美国南部的现代美国作家福克涅尔和斯坦倍克的小说。
    一个南方人——海军大将的儿子，左翼记者吉利摩尔——答应领我去看南美。他有一辆很好的“宾克牌”的汽车，而且有几个星期的空闲时间。我们俩用法语谈话。国务院派“美洲”杂志的编辑奈利生先生陪我们。我同他讲俄国话。在途中又有一个纽约最有名的记者西姆·格拉弗坦加入了我们一群；他想写几篇关于苏联作家同南美的奴隶主会见的速写。我同格拉弗坦谈话是用德国话。奈利生从来未到过南方，他对我们所见的一切的惊讶并不减于我。格拉弗坦进入一间一家三口黑人蜷居着的矮屋里时，惊叫道：“我料不到竟是这样的…………。”当时我告诉他：“山姆大叔终于同汤姆大叔会见了。”（注）
    火车，舒适的半空的车箱；白种人喝着威士忌，打着盹。满满一车箱是黑种人，倾盆大雨，电车站，车辆到了，它是空的，但带着孩子的黑人妇女仍冒着大雨留在原处：给黑人专备的位置坐满了。公园门口写着：“有色人不准进”。鞋店——黑人买皮鞋不准试穿，黑人试穿过的皮鞋便不能卖给白种人了。美国人向我倒讲了多少他们的自由：出版自由，良心自由，迁移自由，可惜！他们倒忘了一件自由——试鞋子的自由……
    所有南方各省都存在着“人种区分”的法律。人种的差别待遇在这儿不是风俗习惯，而是国法。黑人没有权利出席白种人的集会，不敢进有白种人祈祷的教堂。自然，更不应当幻想进白种人的剧院和电影院了。
    我遍游了四州：顿尼西州，阿拉巴马州，密士什比州，路易西亚那州。我看见许多美丽景象；看见顿尼西狭谷的建筑，在这狭谷中起了有着舒适别墅的宏壮的城市，看见新奥尔列安的古风旧习，看见山，看见大河，看见墨西哥湾的蔚蓝。但每走一步我都看见了最怕见的事物：人污辱人。在南美同在北美一样的，——有壮丽的车站。我本想赞美一番这个为轻松工作日的疲劳而作了这么多的设备的国家，但我不能赞美它：在每个壮丽的车站上我都看见了发臭的，黑暗的，挂着“有色人专用”的牌子的小矮屋。一位棉花垦植主人邀请我们。他住着很好的房舍，四外都是老树围绕着。他有妻子——白晰而盛装，有子女——盛装而白晰。流汗的黑人奴隶在四周劳作着。在这位垦植家的房舍里有着美国一切的奇迹——从强力的收音机，它能收到塔什干、麦利布林和安道尔的广播，一直到电风扇。我谈起黑人的苦难。垦植家微笑的答道，不能像对人一样的对待黑人，“这毋宁说是畜牲”。不论无线电收音机也好，电风扇也好，都没有丝毫影响这位奴隶主的智力发展。从他那儿走出来时，我对同路者说：“这不是人，毋宁说是畜牲”。
    密士什比三角洲是棉花农场，土地是属于白种人的，他们把它租给黑人。“佃户”应缴纳棉花收获的半数给地主，其余一半他们应卖给他，而且棉价由地主规定，而黑人得到的微乎其微的小部分，他们又得在那属于同一的主人所有的店铺里换日用品。也许在美国的法律家看来，这是租佃制度，而实际上这却是奴隶制度。我看见土地的所有者，他们同时是棉花的收买者，他们同时又是出售鞋子、煤油、食盐的商人。我想起了曾经贴在纸烟盒上的画片：手持长鞭的奴隶主和田垅上斑斑驳驳的黑妇女……这个奴隶主在我面前对老黑人不时的喝道：“嗳，约翰，快点！……”
    我走进一家贫民窟，二十三口人挤在这窟里：男女混杂着睡觉。哦，这儿离大名鼎鼎的美国技术，离人工的冷气和超级的舒服设备倒有多么远呀！这儿简直不能呼吸，只有褴褛和恶臭。在最“讲究卫生”的美国里，竟有人过着禽兽的生活。一个黑人妇女对我说，她的姐姐因生孩子而死；丈夫没法叫医生，他一年才挣一百八十元，而医费就需要六十元。我看见一家七口人一年总共才挣三百元；还有一家四口一年挣二百元。而一个农场所有者，被认为是小的农场主，他埋怨去年不走运。我问他去年挣多少钱，他答道：“非常少——一共才两万五千元。”
    一个路易西亚那州的奴隶主向我解释：“您不了解黑人：他们像是在天堂中生活着一样，因为他们并不需要更多的什么东西。”在农场里没有学校，然而都为黑人建筑了有着黑人牧师的教堂。由于过度的劳作而快要死去的须发苍白的黑人老头们唱着赞美诗。一个黑人对我说：“我相信，彼世也有两个天堂——白种人的和黑种人的——而且黑人的天堂并不坏似………”。他不能想像到还有不分人种的天堂。
    我的同路者——奈利生、吉利摩尔、格拉弗坦都沉闷地默不作声。而奴隶主怪不自在的说道：“请吃核桃吧。喝威士忌吧。俄国客人到我们这儿来真太好了。在俄国也有棉花吧………”我望着黄澄澄的河水，望着辽阔广大的密士什比州，我知道什么是人类的不幸。在这条河的岸堤上行走着的全部时间，我找不到一句话来说。我耻于向人们瞧望。
    近年来南美改观了，工业的大城市成长起来了。而到温斯坦或者纳柴兹，仍然是家长制度和罗曼谛克的。布尔明甘已经像北方的工业中心了，在布尔明甘有巨大的五金工厂，现代化的设备。工人中有许多黑人。在这儿你仿佛如同在棉花农场里一样，美国南部人已经把超现代的车床与远古的奴隶混合一起了。在工厂里黑人做着最沉重的工作，他们不许可有炼钢师、机械员、电机员，黑人苦工每小时所得到的工资比白种人苦工少十五分钱。
    依照美国的宪法，一切男女公民不分人种都有参加选举之权。但在南美各州黑人剥夺了投票权。在阿拉巴马州有三百万人口，其中一百一十万是黑人。在该州的选民中有四十九万六千人是白种人，四千人是黑种人。在布尔明甘有二十一岁的黑人十三万人，而在选民名册中总共才有一千四百个黑人，由十个黑人中允许一个人投票。在密士什比州黑人占人口的半数，而该州的人口半数便被褫夺了投票权。
    南美各州怎样对付联邦的宪法呢？方法很多。第一、向投票人征收捐税。南美的黑人是一群赤贫的穷人，几块钱在他们看来就富足了。一个黑人求我们把他带到北方某一州，他多年来像幻想天堂的幻想加尔莱姆，他知道他永远也不会积得车票钱。他怎能交付投票捐税呢？除了捐税还有考试：选民应当“懂得而且会解释宪法。”不用说，人种主义信奉者的“监考官”是要把一切黑人都刷下来的。听人讲，一个黑人教授在“应试”时，人们提出了各种文件叫他“解释”。最后，“监考官”给他一张中文报纸（中文是最难懂的文字，他想借此无理的剥夺黑人教授的选举权。——编者）：“您懂得这儿是写的什么吗？”这位教授是没学过中文的，他答道：“我懂得，这儿写的是你们永远不许黑人走到投票箱跟前！”还有，即使黑人交了税而“考”取了，那时奴隶头子会用挺好的小棍儿教训这个不速的选民的。不错，在南美他们知道怎样“解释”宪法的！
    我想起来了，某些美国报纸对南斯拉夫人是如何的愤慨：人民阵线政府褫夺了帮助德国占领者的人们的投票权，——差不多二十万人从选民名册上抹掉了。美国的报纸抗议道：“这叫做什么普选？”同样的这些美国人认为几百万美国黑人（他们中有为美国的自由战斗过的）褫夺投票权是极其自然的事。我只好请教请教美国：褫夺黑良心的人的投票权公道呢，还是褫夺黑皮肤的人的投票权公道呢？
    人种差别待遇的拥护者说：“不能同黑人讲平权，因为黑人是丧失了文化。”的确，人种主义者使尽一切手段使黑人丧失受教育的机会。奈利生在纽约对我说了许多关于人民教育的设施：“凡是到十六岁的美国人一律进学校……”在密士什比州他再不谈人民教育了，我们看见了许多不识字的少年人，我们看见了永远没看见学校的黑人的孩子，他们自小光知道一件事——苦役似的劳动。
    但也不能说奴隶主是白种人的文化的拥护者：他们一般是与其选择初级读本而毋宁选择鞭子的。在密士什比州教员是乞丐：他每年的薪水是六百元。至于说到教黑人的黑皮肤的教员，他们不仅乞食，他们在白种人面前还得卑躬屈膝。白种人监学到了黑人学校，他直呼教员的名子：“喂，比尔！……喂，约翰！……”甚至监学二十五岁，教员五十岁，而教员仍然应当恭恭敬敬回答白种人：“我听从您，史密斯先生。”……
    就譬如在阿拉巴马州，批给民众教育的款项统统发放给白种人了。为了洗清良心，把黑人教授叫了去向他解释：“预算有限，款子已经支出了，你们只好自己想办法……”这个黑人回答得很妙：“你是对的——这儿白种人更需要教育。”
    我在美国南部遇见许多有教养的黑人——学者、作家、医生、教师、律师。这些有文化程度的黑人在这有着过多的怀揣学位文凭的白色生番的南美的背景上，就好像灿烂的斑点。我到过黑人的报馆，这儿每分钟都有受到惩罚威胁的热心家在坚持着人权。
    在私立飞斯克大学有七百个学生：男女黑人。他们是未来的医生、教师、律师，但他们只能医治黑人，只能教黑人的孩子，只有当审问“有色人”时才能出庭。黑人教授不准进入公共图书馆。著名化学家布列第教授告诉我，他不能在国立大学试验室工作，我在飞斯克大学消磨了几个美妙的钟头：我看见了寻求真理的青年。那儿有一个女生，她会说俄国话——一半俄国人：母亲是敖德萨人，父亲是黑人。她白净面不像黑种女人，但在她的护照上却填写着“有色人”，这样便对她关闭了一切大门。
    在新奥尔列安我认识了一位土木工程师，他是一个脸皮枣红色的，有雀斑的人。他看来是一个愉快的谈手，他的博闻广识令我惊倒。我请他到咖啡馆坐坐，他拒绝了，没说明原因。后来朋友向我解释，城里头都知道他是“有色人”，因此他就没有权进咖啡馆。
    手腕漂亮的办报人印上几栏黑人专页，白种人不向这些栏上瞅。如果有白种人在街上打开黑人报纸，他便会遭打或者受到污辱。如果白种人在美国南部公开声明黑人也同白人一样是人的话，他便会遇害。
    （注）欧洲人称美国白人为山姆大叔，称黑人为汤姆大叔。
