　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. Shanghai report: According to the Ta Kung Pao, the Shanghai Student Union has launched a large-scale signature and fundraising campaign to rescue and aid arrested students; the people of Shanghai have provided support. Three well-known scientists residing in Shanghai have written to the Shanghai Garrison Commander and the President of the Executive Yuan, demanding the immediate release of the arrested students.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th. US News Agency report: The American Christian Science Monitor published an editorial on the 3rd, stating: Democracy in China is merely lip service. The Chinese people's opposition to the government is deepening. The government authorities are resorting to high-handed measures to arrest liberals on a large scale. Dozens of Chinese Christian leaders and academic authorities admired by tens of thousands of people in Shanghai are betting everything on this, protesting the anti-democratic actions to the government on the verge of chaos. The current situation in China indicates that China's nominal "democracy" is unfortunately still stuck between the previous two periods (referring to the so-called "military administration" and "tutelage" periods).

　　上海人民支援学联
    营救援助被捕学生
    【新华社陕北八日电】沪讯：据大公报载，上海学生联合会发动大规模签名和募捐运动，以营救及援助被捕学生；上海人民已予支援。久居上海之三个著名科学家曾致函上海卫戍司令与行政院长，要求立即释放被捕学生。
    【新华社陕北八日电】美新闻处讯：美基督教科学箴言报三日发表社论称：民主在中国乃纸上文章。中国人民对政府之反对，日益加深。政府当局不惜采取高压手段大规模逮捕自由主义分子。上海方面数十中国基督教领袖与万人崇仰之学术界权威，皆为此孤注一掷，对违反民主之行动，向陷于混乱边缘之政府提出抗议。目前之中国局势，预示中国名义上之“民主”，不幸仍滞留于前二时期（指所谓“军政”、“训政”时期）之间而已。
