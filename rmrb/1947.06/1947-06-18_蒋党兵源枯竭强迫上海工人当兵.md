Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's internal war troop sources are exhausted, and they are forcibly drafting more than 3,000 unemployed workers in Shanghai into the military. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, they had persisted in working in the rear, but after "victory," they returned to Shanghai only to suffer unemployment. According to Shanghai newspapers, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau of the Chiang clique, stated that "the 'military service' of unemployed workers is the intention of the military service authorities. Shanghai's conscription has not yet begun (scheduled to begin on July 1st), and their livelihoods depend on relief. If they are conscripted into the army, wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone?" Upon learning this, all 3,000-plus unemployed workers indignantly protested, stating on May 20th: "During the eight years of the War of Resistance, we contributed our efforts in the rear, manufacturing guns and cannons to fight the Japanese. Now that we have 'won,' we have returned to our original posts. Are we now supposed to fight in the civil war?" A delegation of unemployed workers stated: "The Executive Yuan has clearly stipulated that our rear-area workers have the right to priority in resuming work. Why has it been delayed for two years and not yet implemented? Is 'military service' the priority we are being given?" All the unemployed workers held a meeting at the Jun Gong Road Hostel on May 21st to discuss countermeasures. Note: These unemployed workers rely solely on rations of flour for their daily sustenance, but the Chiang clique has decided to stop providing rations from June 1st in order to force them into military service.

　　蒋党兵源枯竭强迫上海工人当兵
    【新华社华中十五日电】蒋党内战兵源枯竭，竟强迫上海三千余失业工人当兵，他们在抗战八年中曾坚持后方工作，而在“胜利”后来沪痛遭失业。据沪报讯：蒋党上海市社会局长吴开先曾表示“失业工人‘服兵役’系兵役机关之意，上海征兵既未开始（按预定七月一日开始），彼等生活又依靠救济，如征之为兵，岂非一举两得。”全体三千余失业工人得悉后，愤激抗议，于五月二十日表示：“我们抗战八年在后方出力制造枪炮，为的是打日本人；现在‘胜利’了，我们复员归来，难道还要去打内战。”失业工人代表团表示：“行政院明文规定我们后方工人有优先复工权，为什么时延两年，还未实行？现在‘服兵役’就是给我们的优先权吗？”全体失业工人并于五月二十一日在军工路招待所开会，讨论对策。按：该批失业工人每日仅赖配给面粉为生，而蒋党决定自六月一日起停止配给，以迫使彼等当兵。
