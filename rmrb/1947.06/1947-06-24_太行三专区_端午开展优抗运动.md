　　Taihang Third Special District
    Dragon Boat Festival Launches Comfort the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Soldiers Movement
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Taihang Third Special District Comfort Delegation returned from the Yubei Front, bringing over a hundred valuable suggestions from the soldiers at the front to the government. To respond to the soldiers' requests and thoroughly solve the difficulties faced by military families in production and prosperity, so that the soldiers have no family worries, the Third Special District has specially decided to launch a week-long movement to support the army and give preferential treatment to soldiers starting from the Dragon Boat Festival, carrying out the following tasks: 1. Organize the masses to conduct self-reflection in mutual aid teams, thoroughly examining whether the families of military martyrs, veterans, and revolutionary cadres in the village have any difficulties in establishing themselves. Has the land of military families been planted well first? On the day of the Dragon Boat Festival, hold a general forum for military martyrs and their families to give gifts, listen to their opinions, and educate the military families to realize that their husbands and children are killing enemies and making meritorious services for the people at the front, and that they should work hard in the rear to become rich through production. It is even more glorious to make meritorious service in the front and rear. 2. Inform the families of soldiers who have already been liberated, and those who have not been thoroughly liberated should be filled in, and those who have been struggled against should be taken care of and solved for production difficulties according to the actual situation. 3. Through the Dragon Boat Festival, generally repair and transform the old temples in various villages at no cost to establish martyr's temples and set up martyr's memorial tablets. 4. After the commendation lists from the front line are sent back, we must celebrate every meritorious service. Through the movement, we can select production and army support models and model masses among military martyrs, veterans, and their families, and carry out army support work throughout the year.
