Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th. TASS broadcast: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Mongolian People's Republic stated on the 16th: The recent report in the reactionary Chinese newspaper "China Review Daily" claiming that the Chinese Communist Party obtained ordnance and ammunition from the Mongolian People's Republic, and that CCP commanders and fighters received training in the Mongolian People's Republic, is pure fabrication. This fabrication is a clumsy attempt by the Kuomintang to divert Chinese public opinion from the fact that the Party is actually receiving military aid from other countries.

    揭露《中国评论日报》造谣
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社广播：蒙古人民共和国外交部十六日声称：最近中国反动报纸《中国评论日报》登载的所谓中国共产党自蒙古人民共和国得到军械与军火，和中共指战员在蒙古人民共和国受训一节，纯系捏造。此种捏造，系国民党拙劣的企图转移中国舆论对该党正从其他国家得到真正军事援助之注意。
