(From our correspondent) Changyuan County's Seventh District is a border area closest to the enemy. When Chiang's Fifth Army arrived in Changyuan, the landlords revealed their vicious faces, killing village cadres and activists, reversing grain and land distribution, and demanding that military and workers' families and progressive elements vouch for each other in groups of five. When our army arrived, the landlords immediately changed their smiles, wanting to make mutual "insurance" agreements with the masses. Cheng Liangcang, a landlord from Guanqiaoying, burned yellow paper on the street, saying, "When the Central Army comes, we'll guarantee your safety; when the Eighth Route Army comes, you must guarantee ours. If the Anti-Japanese Alliance asks about matters in our village, everyone must say everything is peaceful." At the time, the masses, intimidated by the landlords' oppression and threats, had no choice but to swear. Later, with the government's resolute support, the pseudo-township office director Zhang Xinzheng and Zhang Xiuzhi were first struggled against in Caopo, which was closer to the border. With cadres taking the lead, the masses' morale soared, and a great deal of property was confiscated. After the masses were relieved of their worries, they no longer feared "changes in weather." They enthusiastically investigated the landlords' hidden wealth and land. A few landlords fled in fear of punishment, joined the pseudo-township offices, and resolutely opposed the people, arresting and robbing people in various villages, which made the masses recognize the true faces of the landlords and shattered the ideas of "double insurance" and "changes in weather." Now, the masses are actively arming themselves and further struggling against the landlords.

　　政府撑腰不怕变天长垣群众坚斗地主
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】长垣县七区是距敌人最近的一个边缘区，当蒋家五军到长垣时，地主露出他凶恶的面孔，杀村干、积极分子，倒粮倒地，叫军、工属和进步分子五家连保。我军来到时，地主马上变了笑脸，要和群众订互相“保险”条约；官桥营地主程良仓等在大街上烧黄表纸说：“中央军来了俺保您的险，八路军来了您也得保俺的险呀，抗联的来了要问咱庄的事，都说平安无事。”当时群众慑于地主摧残威吓，不得已作了宣誓，后经政府坚决撑腰，首先在靠边缘的草坡斗了伪乡公所村长张新正与张秀之，在干部带头下，群众情绪高涨，斗出很多财物。群众解除顾虑后，也不怕“变天”了，兴高彩烈的清查地主的浮财土地，少数地主畏罪逃窜，参加伪乡镇公所，坚决和人民对立，到各村抓人抢劫，使群众认识了地主的真面目，打破了“双保险”、“变天”思想，现在群众纷纷自动武装起来，进一步和地主进行斗争。
