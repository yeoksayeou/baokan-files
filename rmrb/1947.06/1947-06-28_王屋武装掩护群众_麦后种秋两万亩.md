[This article was] Transmitted by Taiyue [Region] on the 26th: The Wangwu border area militia and guerrillas are combating Chiang Kai-shek's army's harassment and protecting the masses as they plant autumn crops after the wheat harvest. Currently, they have rushed to plant 20,000 mu. In Erqu [Second District], Yacun [Ya Village] first planted the sandy soil along the river from the 11th to the 13th in just three days. Yanjiahe [Yan Family River] and Wangjiashan [Wang Family Mountain] sent out twelve oxen to assist with plowing in Longtangou [Dragon Pool Gully] in the Chiang-controlled area, and Zhuangedai [Zhuangeda] dispatched a portion of its labor force to assist with plowing in Lijia Shan [Li Family Mountain]. Therefore, the replanting progressed quickly, and 2,000 mu were planted in four days. Three mutual aid groups in Aoli [Concave Village] launched a summer planting competition, and all the autumn land in the entire village has also been planted. On the evening of the 13th, a unit of the Chiang Kai-shek army from Yuanqu [Yuanqu County] attacked our Anhezhuang [Anhe Village], attempting to sabotage the masses' summer farming. They were discovered by our militia. Comrade Zhang Guirong led a squad of militia in a fierce battle with the enemy at Longtan [Dragon Pool], and all the clothing and sheep that the enemy had seized were intercepted.

    麦后种秋两万亩
    【本报太岳二十六日电】王屋边地民兵游击队打击蒋军袭扰掩护群众麦后回槎，现已突击下种两万亩。二区芽村于十一至十三日三天中先回槎河边沙土地。阎家河、王家山抽出耕牛十二犋往接蒋区龙潭沟助耕，专疙瘩抽调劳力一部到李家山助耕，所以回槎进行很快，四天中抢种二千亩，凹里三个互助组展开夏种竞赛，全庄秋地亦已种完。十三日晚垣曲城蒋军一部袭入我安河庄企图破坏群众夏耕，当被我民兵发觉，张贵荣同志带民兵一班在龙潭与敌发生激战，将敌抢去之衣物及羊等全部截获。
