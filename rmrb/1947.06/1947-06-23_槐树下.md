　　Under the Locust Tree
    Hu Zheng
    Locust blossoms fall beneath the locust tree,
    An old mother sits beneath the tree;
    Mother's hair is white and her eyes are dim,
    Helping our troops sew this and sew that.

　　I said, "Mother, Mother, you're working too hard,
    You shouldn't be doing these things!"
    Mother said, "Child, your words are too distant!
    What do you take this old woman for?"

　　Mother asked me to sit under the locust tree,
    To smoke a cigarette and chat:
    Mother asked me where I was born and where I grew up?
    And when I left my old home.

　　I said my home is south, south of the Yellow River's southern bank,
    Twenty days' walk past the Yellow River.
    I left home at fifteen to do revolution,
    Thirteen years since I saw my own mother's face.

　　I said I grew up following Chairman Mao's family,
    Seeing you is like seeing my own mother.
    Mother said the Eighth Route Army and the people are one family,
    The Eighth Route Army soldiers are all our good children.

　　Mother said, "Send a radio message to Chairman Mao:
    Tell him to live another fifty years for us!
    Tell him that the beast Chiang Kai-shek is harming us,
    If it weren't for Chairman Mao, we wouldn't know where we'd die!"

　　I said I also made a suggestion to Chairman Mao,
    Asking to be transferred to south, south of the Yellow River;
    The mothers in the south are suffering,
    I want to help them turn themselves over.

　　Mother said, "Go, go, I won't keep you,
    The south has good mountains, good water, and good crops;
    North and south are the world of us poor people,
    North and south are all Chairman Mao's home."

　　Mother said, "Take a message back to your own mother,
    Tell her the northern mother is thinking of her;
    Mother will sew you a wheat straw hat,
    Wear it when the wind blows and the rain falls."

　　I said I'm not afraid of heavy thunder or rain,
    In wind and rain, I will also fight for a world for the mothers!
    I threaded the needle and thread with Mother,
    The whistle blew, and I have to go to drill now.

　　槐树下
    胡征
    槐花飘落在槐树下，
    树下坐着老妈妈；
    妈妈头发白了眼又花，
    帮咱队伍缝这又缝那。
　
    我说妈呀妈呀辛苦啦，
    这些事儿不该你做哇！
    妈说你这娃说话太外啦！
    你把我老婆子看成个啥？
　
    妈妈叫我坐在槐树下，
    抽一支香烟把话拉：
    妈问我是那里生来那里长？
    啥时候离开我老家。
　
    我说家住黄河南岸南又南，
    过了黄河还走二十天。
    十五岁离家把革命干，
    十三年没见亲娘的面。
　
    我说跟着毛主席的家庭长这大，
    见了你就是见了咱亲妈。
    妈说八路和百姓是一家，
    八路军都是咱好娃娃。
　
    妈说你给毛主席打个无线电：
    叫他给咱再活上五十年！
    就说蒋介石畜牲把咱害，
    不是毛主席咱不知死在那一天！
　
    我说咱也跟毛主席提了意见，
    要求把咱调到黄河南又南；
    南方的妈妈在受灾难，
    要去帮她们把身翻。
　
    妈说去吧去吧不留你，
    南方有好山好水好庄稼；
    南北都是咱穷人的天下，
    南北都是咱毛主席的家。
　
    妈说回去给你亲娘捎句话，
    就说你北方的妈妈想着她；
    妈给你缝上一顶麦秸帽，
    刮风下雨你戴着它。
　
    我说大雷大雨我不怕，
    风里雨里也要给妈打天下！
    我跟妈妈穿上针和线，
    哨子响了我要去上操啦。
