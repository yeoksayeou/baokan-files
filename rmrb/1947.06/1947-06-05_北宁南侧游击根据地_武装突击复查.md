Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 2nd: The Anci County, a guerrilla base south of the Beining Railway behind enemy lines, is thoroughly implementing land reform through armed assault and review. After our army withdrew from Yongqing, the county party committee of Anci seized the favorable opportunity of the enemy's increased dispersal and the enemy's continuous attacks by us, and immediately put forward the slogan "Resolutely and quickly eliminate feudal exploitation and implement land reform." It transferred turned-over large teams to assist various districts in holding short-term review cadre militia training classes. Some districts, because they were closer to the enemy, organized "cooperative people's assault teams" and "rear agricultural movement consolidation groups" in a planned way. After a month of assault, a review was carried out in seven villages, and land distribution and preliminary liquidation struggles were carried out in eleven villages in the border areas. According to preliminary statistics from fifteen villages, a total of 6,092 mu of good farmland were cleared out, and 591 peasant households were turned over. Among them, 295 extremely poor, military, and martyr families have all risen to the status of middle peasants.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀, 2nd: The counties north of the Daqing River in Central Hebei are resolutely carrying out land reform in the midst of the cruel struggle against the frenzied attacks of Chiang Kai-shek's and puppet troops. Two days before the enemy's attack, a village between Rongcheng and Dingxing completed the review in one night and distributed the fruits. When a village was liquidating, it encountered an enemy attack and immediately transferred to the wild to liquidate the landlords. In the past three months, 32 villages have been mobilized throughout the district, the masses have struggled against 21 evil despots, liquidated 50 landlord households, and obtained fruits for 19,667 peasants.
