Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st. A bumper wheat harvest has been achieved in the Bohai and Jiaodong liberated areas north of the Jiaoji Railway. All 26,128,000 mu of wheat fields in the Bohai region have been harvested, and farmers are universally calling this year's harvest the best in a decade. The new district of Linzi has seen an increase of 20 to 25 jin per mu. In western Jiaodong, Changyi, Weixian, Pingdu, Gaomi, and the various counties north of the Wei River have already completed threshing, while the eastern part will begin harvesting after the summer solstice. The entire region has a total of 25 million mu of cultivated land, with wheat fields accounting for 70 percent in the plains and 30 percent in the mountains, totaling approximately 12.5 million mu planted with wheat. Due to well-distributed rainfall this spring, yields have increased by at least 10 jin per mu, with an average yield of approximately 200 jin per mu (large mu) in the plains and about 80 jin per mu in the mountains. Based on a total average of 120 jin per mu, Jiaodong's total output this year should exceed 1.5 billion jin.

　　渤海胶东两区
    今年小麦丰收
    【新华社山东二十一日】胶济路北侧，渤海胶东两解放区小麦丰收。渤海全区两万万六千一百二十八万市亩麦田全部收完，农民咸称今年丰收为十年来所未有。临淄新区每亩增产二十斤至二十五斤。胶东西部昌（邑）潍（县）平（度）高（密）及潍北各县小麦均已登场，东部待夏至后始能收割。全区耕地共有两千五百万亩，平原地区麦地占百分之七十，山区占百分之三十，约种小麦一千二百五十万亩。由于今春雨水调匀，产量每亩至少增加十斤，平原地平均每亩（大亩）约达二百斤，山地每亩八十斤左右。按每亩总平均一百二十斤推算，胶东今年总产量当在十五万万斤以上。
