　　"Four-L棱子" Disguised as a Car
    A Record of a Regiment's Ambush

    The troops assigned to intercept the cars were already ambushed around Dazheng Village, three miles north of the Cao (County) southern Yellow River levee, at six o'clock in the morning. Sure enough, around eight o'clock, the enemy's cars drove onto the levee entrance. The soldiers gripped their guns tightly, waiting quietly; but the cars didn't come forward. They poked their heads out there, then poked their heads out again, like a fish about to be hooked.

    "They've probably been spotted by the enemy," the deputy regimental commander said, walking towards the reconnaissance squad: "Who's going to call them over?" As soon as the words were spoken, "Four-L棱子" replied, "I'll go!"

    "Aren't you afraid?"

    "Send someone to watch me, and see what Four-L棱子 can do!" Four-L棱子 was a little annoyed; he immediately changed into plain clothes, pushed a small cart, tightened his belt, and started pushing it south, guā guā dā dā. When he got to the levee, there were seven cars and some merchants' carts parked there. Two cars were turning around to drive back to Shangqiu.

    "Hey!" An officer in one of the cars said: "How many Eighth Route Army soldiers are over there?"

    "None! They've all been beaten away by us!"

    "Don't go!" Another said: "What do you do?"

    "I'm back from selling cigarettes in the city!"

    "What the hell are you pretending to be, Eighth Route Army spy, come here!" Four-L棱子 approached the car.

    "Let the carts go first. If nothing happens, fine, otherwise, watch your head!" Four-L棱子 wasn't flustered. He watched the several carts loaded with goods fly down the levee, enter Dazheng Village, and then poked his head out from the north side of the village again. However, Four-L棱子 knew that our main force was still in the villages north of Dazheng Village. Although the carts were allowed to pass, the cars would have to be stopped.

    "Doesn't look like an Eighth Route Army spy!" the officer said, a smile appearing on his face.

    "Officer!" Four-L棱子 took out 10,000 yuan in legal tender and stuffed it into the man's hand: "Hey! Buy some cigarettes to smoke, not much, hey!" That "conscientious" officer even gave him back 2,000 yuan and let him go.

    Watching the seven cars, one after another, farting, driving north like whirlwinds, Four-L棱子 bent over and walked quickly northeast along the levee.

    "Whoosh, bang!"
    "Da da..." Gunshots and explosions sounded like a string of firecrackers. "I, Four-L棱子, am like a death god!" Four-L棱子 laughed and sang, dashing away with the gunshots...

    Not bad at all, this battle resulted in four cars. (Hei Sheng)

　　“四楞子”化装叫汽车
    记一个团的伏击战
    截击汽车的部队，早上六点钟就埋伏在曹（县）南黄河大堤北三里的大郑庄一带，果然，八点钟光景，敌人的汽车走上堤口，战士们紧握着枪，静静的等待着；但汽车却没有前来，在那里探探头，又探探头，像一条将要上钩的鱼。
    “大概被敌人发觉了。”团副说着走向侦察班：“那个去叫它来？”话刚落地，“四楞子”就答了腔：“我去！”
    “你怕不怕？”
    “派个人监视着我，看看咱四楞子！”四楞子有点恼火；立刻换了便衣，推个小车，扎上腰，呱呱哒哒的推起往南去了。走到大堤，有七辆汽车，还有一些商人的马车停在那里，有两辆汽车正扭转头要开回商邱。
    “喂”！汽车上一个军官说：“那边有多少八路军呀？”
    “没有啦！都叫咱打跑啦！”
    “不要走哩！”另一个说：“你是干啥的？”
    “我从城里卖烟回来啦！”
    “啥他妈的装形，八路探子，过来！”四楞子走近汽车。
    “先把马车放过去，没事便罢，不然，小心你的脑袋！”四楞子的心里并不慌，他看着载货物的几辆马车，飞似的跑下堤去，进了大郑庄，又从村北边露出头来。但是，四楞子心里有数，我们的主力还在大郑庄以北的村子里，虽然马车放行，汽车可就要挡驾了。
    “不像八路探子！”当官的说着，脸上露出笑容。
    “官长！”四楞子掏出一万元法币塞进了那人的手里：“嘿！买点烟吸，不多嘿！”那个有“良心”的官还给他留了两千，放他走了。
    眼看着七辆汽车一个挨一个的，放着屁，像旋风似的往北开去，四楞子弯腰急速顺大堤向东北走去。
    “呼，叭！”
    “达达……。”枪声炸弹声像连珠炮一样地响起来。“我四楞子好似勾命鬼！”四楞子笑着唱着同枪声飞奔而去……。
    一点也不差，这次战斗弄了四辆汽车。（黑生）
