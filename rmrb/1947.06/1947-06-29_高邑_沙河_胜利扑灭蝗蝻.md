Gaoyi · Shahe
    Victory in Eradicating Locust Nymphs
    [Reported from Gaoyi by this newspaper] In the first, third, and fourth districts, locust nymphs were discovered in twenty-nine villages at the end of May. Combining efforts with wheat harvesting, women and children were mobilized to eradicate them with all their strength, capturing, beating, and burying them. After twenty days of locust eradication war, most of the locust nymphs have been captured and destroyed. In Xinzhuang Village, Fourth District, after some millet seedlings were eaten, a large alliance of five nearby villages was organized on the 10th, forming a team of more than 450 people. After three days of annihilation warfare, most of the locusts were wiped out. The areas with the highest density of locust nymphs were around Dongtaying and Dongliangzhuang, and they have now been mostly eliminated, with the remaining scattered ones expected to be eliminated within days.
    During the locust eradication efforts, everyone in the villages was highly motivated and created four methods of fighting locusts: one was to organize teams of twenty to fifty people, surround the area, and slowly drive the locusts to the center using tree branch bundles to concentrate and eliminate them; another was to surround the area and place large bedsheets in the middle, driving the locusts around to gather them, then slowly shaking the bedsheets to exterminate them; another was to surround the area and place wheat straw in the middle, driving the locust nymphs onto or near the wheat straw to burn them; and another was to dig trenches and drive the locusts into them for burial. On June 12th, a joint encirclement with Lincheng County was carried out on an area of more than fifty acres of wasteland bordering Gaoyi and Lincheng (near Xinzhuang), eradicating the locust nymph nests after a day of annihilation. (Wen Yan, Shu Wen, Gao You, Yi Min)
    [Reported from Lincheng by this newspaper] Locust nymphs have been discovered in various districts of this county. In the first district, an area of eighteen acres in Mengcun Liusi Dongyangquan, and a seven-to-eight-li-long area connected to Gaoyi, was discovered. In Lingxi East in the Fifth District, locust nymphs were emerging and eating green seedlings on one acre of land, with four or five being able to be swatted with one hand. The leadership is currently organizing a full-scale capture and eradication effort. (Xiu Lin, Shi Ying)
    [Reported from Shahe by this newspaper] Since June 2nd, locusts have been discovered in six villages around the Sixth District of Shahe. By June 7th, they had spread to twenty-three villages. At most, there were an average of more than thirty locusts in one square foot of area, and five or six could be killed with a single slap. The locust nymphs have been mostly eliminated.
    In this locust eradication effort, the most effective method tested in Dalianzhuang was the "small circle encirclement battle," which was divided into three steps: first, the "bag shape"; second, the "sieve ring formation"; and third, the "snake shedding skin." In specific activities, the locust eradication team was first arranged in a "bag shape," slowly advancing and shrinking, driving the locust nymphs to concentrate in one area, gradually turning into a circular encirclement of "sieve ring formation." Then, they continued to shrink, turning into "snake shedding skin," making a large circle enclose small circles, with three circles in total, the inner circle driving a large number of locust nymphs into earth pits dug in the fields, with the dug pits varying in size, some half a day wide, some two or three feet long, mostly dug on the ridges of watery land, while the outer two circles eliminated the remaining locust nymphs, thus ensuring thorough eradication.
    The county political commissar, district chief Liu, agricultural and forestry bureau cadres, and others participated in this locust eradication effort. The masses said, "The prefectural commissioner and county cadres have also come to lead the locust eradication effort, which is different from the previous government."
    After half a month of locust eradication campaign across the district, the enthusiasm of the masses has greatly increased. In particular, some older women initially only used willow branches to shoo them away, but later, seeing that the more they hit, the fewer there were, they put more effort into hitting them, taking more care of the green seedlings. Yin Deqi, an ordinary shopkeeper, said: "I used to think that hitting them was just fooling around, but now it seems that it must be done." Although new batches of locust nymphs are constantly emerging, the courage and confidence of the masses to eliminate them are growing day by day. (Cong Li, Kui Lin, Huang Ting)

　　高邑·沙河
    胜利扑灭蝗蝻
    【本报高邑讯】一、三、四区在五月底廿九个村发现蝻子，结合收麦，动员妇女、儿童全力进行扑灭，捕打掩埋，经过二十天的剿蝗战，蝗蝻已大部被捕灭。四区辛庄村在一部谷苗被吃后，于十日组织了附近五村的大联合，组织了四百五十余人的一个大队，经过了三天的歼灭战，蝗虫大部被打光了。蝗蝻最稠的有东塔影、东良庄一带，现亦已大部消灭，零星的日内即可消灭。
    各村在打蝗中大家情绪很高，创造了四种打蝗办法：一是组织成二十人至五十人的队形，周围包围起来用树条编的把子慢慢赶，赶到当中集中消灭；一是包围后用大被单放当中，周围赶，集中起来后，将被单慢慢抖起进行扑灭；一是包围后，当中放麦秸将蝗蝻赶到麦秸上或麦秸附近以火烧；一是刨壕刨正赶入进行掩埋。六月十二日，又与临城联合包围了高（邑）临（城）交界处（辛庄）一带五十余亩荒地的蝗蝻区，经一天剿灭，将蝻子老窝都剿灭了。（文彦、淑文、高友、一民）
    【本报临城讯】本县各区发现蝗蝻，在一区的孟村留寺东羊泉有十八亩大的一片地，有七八里地长地区发现和高邑相连。五区岭西东蝗蝻出土吃青苗一亩，一手能拍四、五个，现领导上正组织全力捕打中。（修临、士英）
    【本报沙河讯】从六月二日起，沙河六区一带，已有六个村庄发现蝗虫，到六月七日，就蔓延到二十三个村，最多时，一方尺的面积，平均有三十多个，一掌拍下，即可拍死五、六个。蝗蝻已被消灭大部。
    这次在剿蝗方法上在搭连镇试验结果，最有效力的是“小圈包围战”，其中并分为三个步骤，第一是“布袋形”，第二是“箩圈阵”，第三是“长虫脱皮”。这三个步骤在具体活动时，先把剿蝗队伍布置成“布袋形”，慢慢前进紧缩，赶蝗蝻向一块集中，逐渐变成一种圆圈包围的“萝圈阵”，还要继续紧缩，变成“长虫脱皮”，使大圈套小圈，里外共有三个圈，里圈将大批蝗蝻赶进地里土坑中，刨成的土坑大小不等，有天半宽的，有二尺或三尺长的，多刨在水地垅沟上边，外两圈消灭残余蝗蝻，这样，能剿灭净尽。
    参加这次剿蝗的，有县政委、刘区长、农林局干部等，群众们说：“专署干部、县里干部还来领导剿蝗，和以前的政府就是不一样了。”
    全区经过半月来的打蝗运动，群众的情绪大大提高了，特别是开始有些老年妇女只用柳条哄哄就算，后来见越打越少，她们便下功夫打了，对青苗更小心，普通店尹德奇说：我过去认为打也是胡闹，现在看起来，就是非打不沾。虽然现在蝗蝻不断的一批一批出土，但群众消灭它的勇气和信心也一天一天的大起来了。（从里、奎林、荒亭）
