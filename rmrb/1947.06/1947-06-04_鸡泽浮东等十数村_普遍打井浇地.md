[Report from our Jinnan Office on the 2nd] Dozens of villages in the third district of Jize, including Fudong, Fuxi, and Puga, are making full use of existing old wells to vigorously irrigate their land. Fudong Village originally had 154 large wells for a population of 2,120. Under the leadership of village head Ren Xifu, the entire village made sure that no well was idle and no one at home was idle, with the majority of young women participating, irrigating the land day and night. They have now sown 34 hectares, averaging 0.1 hectares per person. They are now also proposing to dig new wells, and more than ten have already been dug. Baizhi Temple, Puga, Xiliu Village, Xiliuying, and Jiao Zuoying Village also plan to dig 30 wells each, Fuxi 50 wells, and Dong Liu Xia 100 wells. The villages are digging wells and sowing seeds at the same time. In the fourth district, Nan Zhen Song men water the gardens, children change the ridges, and women also go to the fields to water the gardens and sow seeds, watering all the well land in the two villages, and sowing 700 mu and spot-sowing 500 mu.

[Report from our Jinnan Office on the 2nd] After the higher authorities put forward the call to prepare for famine by digging wells, the masses in Dongtunzhuang in the second district of ×× County were not very enthusiastic about digging wells and did not take action. After in-depth understanding by the district cadres, the masses had ideological obstacles because last year the yield of well land was set several times higher than that of ordinary dry land, but in reality, the harvest of some well land was not much higher than that of ordinary dry land due to lack of manpower and animal power. The masses reflected, "It is not guaranteed that digging wells will increase the harvest, but first of all, one mu of land has to bear the burden of more than two mu." The leadership immediately explained to the masses: in the future, newly dug wells will never increase the burden, and will still be calculated according to the previous yield. As a result, the ideological problem was solved, and the enthusiasm of the masses was greatly improved. It is planned to dig ten wells in the first batch. In order to reward well digging and solve practical difficulties, the leadership proposed to dismantle broken temple bricks, and all the masses unanimously agreed, immediately uniting to organize mutual assistance and preparing to process well digging.

[Report from our Jinnan Office on the 2nd] Wu Runde's group in Jiudian in the first district of Feixiang can be called a model in drought prevention and famine preparation. They have eliminated the idea of "relying on heaven for food" and "waiting for rain" and have strengthened their confidence in "man can conquer nature." Since the beginning of spring, seeing that the rainfall was not frequent, they made plans early. Before the leadership called for it, they borrowed water wells from neighboring land to plant seeds. Because the water was not abundant, they also dug out the wells and turned the land into ditches, watering it universally. Three "windlasses" and five people planted five mu of cotton in four days, and also carried water to plant three mu of crops in remote land. They said, "More effort guarantees food. This watering can last until the flowers are five inches high. Anyway, they are all ridges now. If it doesn't rain, watering it again will allow us to harvest flowers. It doesn't matter if it rains or not." In order to prepare for a longer-term famine, they also mutually helped each other to dig a well, which was two zhang deep and more than five chi in diameter at the bottom, using a total of fifteen workers, and could water five fen of land in one afternoon. Wu Derun said, "Although the project is not big, we don't have to rely on heaven anymore. As long as we find a way to do it, the disaster can be overcome." While planting rice fields, they said triumphantly, "Digging a well is not difficult. We pulled two and a half cartloads of bricks from the temple, and a few people worked together. We didn't spend a penny and dug a well. This well can ensure the seedlings for the autumn wheat and spring wheat seasons for our five families, and this can completely overcome the disaster."

　　鸡泽浮东等十数村
    普遍打井浇地
    【本报冀南二日电】鸡泽三区浮东、浮西、普高等十数村充分利用原有旧井，大力浇地。浮东村原有大井一百五十四眼，共人口二千一百二十口，在村长任希福领导下，全村不闲一个井，家里不闲一个人，青年妇女大部参加，日夜浇地，现已播种三十四顷，每人平均一亩六分。现又纷纷提出挖新井，已挖好十多眼。柏枝寺、普高、西柳村、西柳营、焦左营村亦计划各挖三十眼，浮西五十眼，东柳下一百眼。各村一面挖井，一面播种。四区南臻松男人浇园，小孩改畦子，妇女也下地浇园点种，把两村所有井地浇完，并播种七百亩，点种五百亩。
    【本报冀南二日电】上级提出备荒打井号召后，××县二区东屯庄群众对打井不很带劲，都不动手，经区干深入了解，群众存有思想障碍，因去年将井地产量定为比一般旱地高好几倍，但实际上有的井地收获因人畜力缺乏并不比一般旱地高多少，群众反映说：“叫打井能不能多收还不保险，可是首先一亩地得出二亩以上的负担。”领导上当即向群众说明：今后新打的井绝不加重负担，仍按以前产量计算。于是思想问题解决了，群众情绪大大提高，计划第一批能打井十个。领导上为奖励打井与解决实际困难，提出拆用破庙砖，全体群众一致同意，即刻串连组织互助，准备加工打井。
    【本报冀南二日电】肥乡一区旧店吴润德组在防旱备荒中堪称模范，他们打掉了“靠天吃饭”、“等待下雨”思想，坚定了“人能胜天”的信心。入春以来，一看雨水不勤，就早作了打算，在领导上未号召前，他们就借用邻地水井点种、因水不旺，又掏了掏井，将地挑成沟子，普遍浇水，三把“辘辘”五个人四天种了五亩棉花，又挑水点种了远地三亩庄稼，他们说：“多出力气吃的准，这样一浇能顶到花长五寸高，反正都成畦子了，不下雨再浇一水就可收花，下不下雨不吃劲”。他们为更长期备荒，又互助打了一眼井，井深两丈、底径五尺余，共用工十五个，一晌可浇五分地。吴德润说：“工程虽然大不，可是不用靠天了，只要想办法干，灾荒是可以渡过的”。他们一面在种水田，一面洋洋得意的说：“打井并不难，从庙上拉上两车半头砖，几个人伙干，一文钱没化，打了一眼井。一眼井俺这五家保险能按上秋麦两季的苗子，这就可以完全战胜灾荒。”
