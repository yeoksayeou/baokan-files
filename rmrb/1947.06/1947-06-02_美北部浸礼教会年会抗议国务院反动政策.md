　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th: TASS, New York: According to reports, four thousand delegates attending the annual meeting of the Northern Baptist Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, passed a resolution urging all churches to make special efforts to increase understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union and to actively cooperate with the church committee of the US-Soviet Association. The meeting also passed other resolutions protesting the State Department's policy of "expanding the arms race and imperialist program to protect private foreign investment." The resolution also opposed universal compulsory military training, urged the cessation of military training in public primary and secondary schools, and expressed concern about the tendency of the United States to restrict civil rights, especially the recent Supreme Court decision approving the FBI's power to search private homes without warrants.

    【新华社陕北二十七日电】塔斯社纽约讯：报载：出席在新泽西州大西洋城举行之年会的北部浸礼教会四千名代表通过决议，敦促各教会特别努力以增进美苏间之了解并积极与美苏协会之教会委员会合作。该会又通过其他一些决议，抗议国务院“为了庇护私人国外投资的扩军计划及帝国主义纲领”之政策。该决议并反对普遍强迫军训，敦促停止公立中小学军训，并对美国限制公民权利之倾向表示忧虑，特别是最近最高法院批准联邦调查局不用证件即可搜查私人住宅之权力的决议。
