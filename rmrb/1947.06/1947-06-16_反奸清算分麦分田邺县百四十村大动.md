[Our Newspaper, Ye County News] Ye County is a newly liberated area from the recent豫北 (Yu Bei) Northern Henan Campaign. After the democratic government was established on May 3rd, it immediately arranged a movement for the people to speak out about their suffering, seek revenge, and achieve emancipation. Over the past month, the masses have taken extensive action and achieved great results. Due to the long-term oppression and rule of the enemy, the stubborn elements, the puppets, the traitors, the bullies, and the landlords for more than ten years, the lives of the people in this county have been extremely miserable. Most of the people eat valley noodles, chaff vegetables, and leaves. The masses eagerly hoped that the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army would come to liberate them, but due to the rumors and deceptions of the stubborn puppets and traitorous bullies, the masses initially had some doubts about us. Based on this situation, the leadership first focused on the urgent demands of the masses, confiscated the property of traitors to provide relief to the masses, and solved the serious famine. During the relief efforts, activists were discovered and cultivated to prepare for a major emancipation through speaking out.

In just ten days, the masses dispelled their doubts from our practical actions, and all the rumors were self-defeating. In dozens of villages that had been provided with relief, activists were discovered and began to brew speak-out revenge, and further demanded liquidation, grain distribution, and land distribution. The masses in most other villages also unanimously hoped that we would help them.

At the district chief and branch secretary meeting on May 15th, the county party committee summarized the situation in the county and clearly stipulated that the general policy of the current movement was: to guide the masses towards speaking out, liquidation, grain distribution, and land distribution through confiscation and relief. The method was to support and make decisions from top to bottom, suppress confiscation, and simultaneously advance the speaking out and liquidation from bottom to top.

After the meeting, after ten days of work, after most villages had been confiscated, relieved, and initially mobilized through speaking out and connecting with each other, the masses' awareness was significantly improved, and more activists emerged. The conditions for a large-scale movement were already in place. In order to make the movement develop in a balanced way and take large-scale action, the county party committee immediately seized the opportune moment and decided to train a large number of activists from the hired poor and middle peasants to break the situation. To this end, a meeting of activists based on the base points was organized to publicize our party's policy of anti-treason and revenge and land to the tiller. After typical speaking-out, class boundaries were drawn, and action methods were studied, and they immediately returned to the village to visit the suffering and connect with each other to speak out and work. In the leadership of the district cadres this time, the old routine of sticking to one village was completely changed, and a new leadership method of using a large number of activists to universally ignite fires and create smoke together was created, which quickly broke the situation. Great achievements have been made in this short month. According to statistics before May 28th, 143 villages in the county have been widely mobilized, confiscating all the property of 134 heinous traitors and landlords and distributing it to the masses, with about 300 shi of grain to relieve the masses. 134 puppet security regimes were destroyed, and more than 900 activists emerged. Many villages have produced their own mass leadership groups, and the wave of movement has shaken the county. In the artillery fire of our army besieging Anyang, Huangjiaying Village in the first district held a joint struggle meeting of more than 3,000 people, and the masses could not finish taking the confiscated property of the traitors in one day. The demobilized soldiers of Zhoujia Village automatically and independently led the struggle against the puppet Bao chiefs, confiscating the belongings of the traitorous landlords. The basic masses of Sanguanmiao directly ran to the district to call for workers to go to their village. The fifth district ignited the flames of emancipation in more than 20 villages in five days. Some of the masses in the second district automatically went to the edge of the city to capture their most hated objects. The large-scale anti-traitor purge, grain distribution, and land distribution movement has been launched throughout the county. The third district, which developed the latest, also obtained 1,500 mu of wheat fields in more than 20 villages in just five days, and the peasants harvested most of the wheat to their own fields, happily saying: "This year's May is their own May." In the villages adjacent to the enemy in the first district, the masses also automatically got up to harvest the wheat of the traitorous landlords.

　　反奸清算分麦分田邺县百四十村大动
    【本报邺县讯】邺县是这次豫北战役中才解放的新区，民主政府于五月三日成立后，立即布置了诉苦复仇翻身运动，一月来群众已广泛行动起来，并获得巨大的成绩。本县群众由于敌、顽、伪、奸、霸、地主十余年长期压榨统治，生活痛苦不堪，大部群众以谷面、糠菜、树叶为食，群众热望共产党八路军来解放自己，但由于顽伪奸霸的造谣欺骗，开始群众对我们又有着若干疑惑。根据这情况，领导上首先抓紧群众迫切要求，没收汉奸财产救济群众，解决严重的饥荒。救济中并发现培养积极分子酝酿诉苦为大翻身作准备。
    在短短十天中，群众从我们的实际行动中，解除了疑虑，一切造谣不攻自破，在数十个经过救济的村，发现了积极层，开始酝酿诉苦复仇，并进一步要求清算、分麦、分田。其他大部村子的群众，也都一致盼望我们去帮助。
    在五月十五日的区长、分书会议上，县委总结了全县情况，明确规定当前运动的总方针是：经过没收救济引导群众走向诉苦清算分麦、分由，办法是自上而下的撑腰作主、镇压没收与自下而上的发动诉苦清算双头并进。
    会后，经过十天的工作，大部村经过没收、救济诉苦串通初步发动后，群众觉悟显著提高，积极分子涌现的更多了，大规模运动的条件已经具备。为使运动平衡开展，并大规行动起来，县委即抓紧火候，决定大量训练雇贫中积极层轰开局面。为此组织了以基点为单位的积极分子大会，宣传我党反奸复仇及耕者有其田的政策，经过典型诉苦，划清阶级界线，又研究了行动的方法，立即回村访苦，串通诉苦干起来。这次区干部的领导上，完全改变了过去死守一村的老套，创造了大量运用积极分子，普遍点火一齐冒烟的新领导方法，迅速的轰开了局面，在这短短的一个月中获得了很大成绩。根据五月廿八日以前的统计，全县有一百四十三个村庄已经广泛的行动起来，没收了一百三十四户罪大恶极的汉奸地主的全部家产，分给群众，约有三百石粮食救济了群众。摧毁了一百三十四个伪保政权，涌现出九百多个积极分子。不少村已产生了群众自己的领导集团，运动浪潮震动了全县。一区黄家营村在我军围困安阳的炮火中，召开了三千余人的联合斗争大会，光没收汉奸的财物群众一天没拿完。周家村的退伍军人，自动单独领导反伪保长斗争，没收汉奸地主东西，三官庙的基本群众直接跑到了区上叫工作员去他村，五区在五天中燃烧起廿余个村的翻身烈火。二区群众有的自动到城边捉拿他们最仇恨的对象。反奸清算、分麦分田大运动已在全县展开。发展最迟的三区，在短短的五天中，也有二十多个村已获得了一千五百亩麦地，农民已把大部麦子收割到自己的场里，高兴的说着：“今年的五月是自己的五月。”一区接敌村庄，群众也自动起来抢收汉奸地主的麦子。
