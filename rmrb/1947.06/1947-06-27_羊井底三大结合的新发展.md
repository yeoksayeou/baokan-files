　　New Development of the Three-Way Combination in Yangjingdi
　　Wang Julin

　　Yangjingdi's production in the past five months has been very good. The whole village mobilized 2,600 workdays; in sideline production, they spun 4,710 catties of cotton, wove 4,100 feet of cloth, spun 170 catties of wool, and earned 2.4 million yuan in transportation. Workshops, factories, and large and small cooperatives earned about 3 million yuan. The 1,700 mu of autumn land, with drought resistance, has been sown with full seedlings and has been deeply cultivated and carefully worked, surpassing previous years. Now, the 570 mu of Jin Huanghou cotton has been hoed for the first time. Agricultural and sideline production has not been affected in the slightest by participation in the war and grain transportation, and the results are very good. This is due to the success of the three-way combination in the village.

　　The village has 193 households, 836 people, and a total of more than 2,100 mu of land. In addition to the labor force working outside, there are 101 full laborers, but sideline production occupies 24 of them, and there are also 55 semi-laborers and more than 240 women engaged in spinning and weaving. When spring plowing began, 20 people left to participate in the war, and each full laborer at home had to cultivate an average of 40 mu of land. Under these circumstances, agricultural and sideline production must be combined with war service work, otherwise it would be impossible to solve the contradiction of labor use.

　　In addition to establishing a unified leadership organization for the whole village, the cadres first determined a unified wage and unified work points for the whole village. Their wages were five sheng of rice. A full laborer in agricultural production earned their own share of ten points for a workday, and those participating in the war earned twelve points from the public. Plowing was done according to labor, and according to the size of the plot, including plowing once or twice and harrowing once, each hectare was set at 2.5 to 3 mu, with 6 workdays for valley land and 7 workdays for corn land. Supporting the front and carrying 60 catties back and forth 60 li was worth 10 points, and livestock carrying 90 catties was worth 10 points. Light work referred to male and female semi-laborers, with men delivering letters 60 li round trip and women 30 li round trip worth one workday. Standing guard for one day was worth 6 points. In this way, a large-scale exchange of labor was carried out throughout the village, with more work earning more points. This is one aspect of the combination of agriculture and war service.

　　The combination of agriculture and sideline production is manifested in the exchange of labor. For example, spinning 12 taels of cotton was worth one agricultural workday, and weaving one zhang of cloth was worth one agricultural workday. Women could specialize in spinning and weaving, and handicrafts were worth about 16 agricultural points according to wages. Mutual aid groups that worked for him earned three more points in wages, so neither was delayed and neither suffered losses. Even during the sowing period, carpenters did not stop producing tools.

　　The unified distribution of profits from transportation is the concentrated expression of the three-way combination. In order to reward the collective labor of mutual aid and the labor of those who went out to transport, they carried out a 20-80 profit split. In order to reward the labor of those who participated in the war, they distributed profits according to the remaining work points. The method was that those who went out to transport received 80% of the profits after deducting expenses, and the land at home was cultivated by the mutual aid group, which paid the mutual aid group's wages. The labor at home was calculated according to the number of collective workdays in the group, and the labor participating in the war, in addition to the workdays used for their own substitute cultivation, was distributed 20% of the profits according to the remaining number of workdays. This method allowed the labor force working outside to save on travel expenses and also rewarded the collective and the labor force participating in the war. This is the benefit of this method.

　　Another manifestation of the three-way combination is the unified use of labor. When there was not enough agricultural labor during the rush to sow, 63 sideline laborers (from large and small cooperative factories) took a holiday to participate in sowing. But when agriculture was not very busy, 20 agricultural laborers and 20 head of livestock were drawn to transport goods and earn 810,000 yuan (during the spring plowing). That is to say, in terms of labor use, the role of various labor forces was also maximized. For example, full laborers did heavy work, and semi-laborers and auxiliary laborers did light work. In this way, full laborers earned up to 12 points, and children were also used as adults. For example, when arranging codonopsis pilosula seedlings, children were faster than adults. During grain transportation, there was even a laborer who carried 90 catties and earned 15 points, and livestock that carried 130 to 140 catties and earned 17 or 18 points. This also greatly improved labor efficiency and promoted the development of the combination.

　　The three-way combination also promoted the development of agricultural mutual aid, and contract labor was carried out. They made more concentrated use of labor and increased labor intensity. On the basis of the three-way combination, in order to adapt to the tense situation of weeding and summer harvesting, large-scale weeding contracts were carried out. When weeding began, the cadres felt that life was squeezed together, but sideline agriculture and life could not be delayed. It was calculated that 570 mu of Jin Huanghou cotton would take 12 days to weed. Only by saving more labor in agriculture could there be surplus labor for sideline production. Under these circumstances, the group of labor hero Liu Shengcai first appeared with a contract to weed 19 mu, saving an average of 6 work points per mu. That night, this method was broadcast throughout the village, and then all three brigades promoted it. The method of contracting first evaluated work points household by household, because the evaluation of work points was the key. In addition to stipulating a first-class standard: such as 10 points per mu for Jin Huanghou, and 30 points per mu for cotton, it was also necessary to go to the field to see the specific conditions (density of seedlings, size of grass, looseness of the land) to increase or decrease the points. The group leader was the foreman, and life and death points were flexibly converted. In order to reward technology, standards for earning merit and increasing points were stipulated. Finally, long-term laborers were given dividends according to work points. In this way, morale was greatly boosted, and the 12-day plan was completed in 5 days, saving 350 workdays, with the remaining labor pulling 49 carts of coal, earning 120,000 yuan in transportation, and reclaiming more than 30 mu of wasteland. Coal pulling also adopted a 10-90 profit sharing method to take care of general and war-participating labor. This contract directly promoted the development of textile and transportation sideline production.

　　Recently, the whole village conducted a summary, calculating that 360 workdays were saved in weeding and 2,600 workdays were saved in sowing. 982 mu of land was plowed three times, and 1,118 mu was harrowed three times. Last year, 200 mu of seedlings were left unplanted because of participation in the war, but this year there is not a single missing seedling, and it was planted one solar term earlier. Everyone researched the reason: carrying water three li away did not use whole workdays, saving 30 workdays every day. Eighty auxiliary laborers were organized to take on major tasks. Secondly, sideline labor participated in the rush to sow. The unanimous opinion was that the contract gave them energy. In the past, weeding had the "four officials resting seventy-two grindings" (meaning wasting time), but this year only one bag of tobacco was left (meaning only smoking once). In previous years, one mu took ten workdays, but this year one workday weeds one and a half mu.

　　羊井底三大结合的新发展
    王巨林
    羊井底五个月的生产作的很好，全村行动用了两千六百个工；副业生产中纺花四千七百一十斤，织布四千一百斤，纺毛一百七十斤，运输赚洋二百四十万元，作坊、工厂，大小合作社赚洋三百来万元；一千七百亩秋地在抗旱下种中捉了全苗，而且深耕细作超过往年，现在五百七十亩金皇后棉花已锄过头遍。农副业生产不但没有因参战运粮受到丝毫影响，而且成绩很好，这是由于该村三大结合的成功。
    该村有一百九十三户，八百三十六口人，共地二千一百余亩，除了外出劳力尚有全劳力一百○一个，但副业生产就占去二十四个，还有五十五个半劳力，纺织妇二百四十多个。当春耕开始，参战又走了二十个，家里每个全劳力平均要种四十亩地。在这类情况下，农副生产必须和战勤工作结合，否则就无法解决劳力使用的矛盾。
    干部除建立全村的统一领导机构之外，首先确定全村统一工资与统一折工。他们工资是五升米，全劳力农业生产一个工吃自己的折十分，参战吃公家的折十二分。犁地按劳，根据地块大小，包括犁一遍到两遍耢种各一遍，每垧规定二亩半到三亩，谷地定为六个工，玉茭地七个工。支差负重六十斤往返六十里折十分，牲口九十斤折十分。轻差指男女半劳力，男人送信往返六十里、女人三十里折一工。站岗一天折六分，这样按全村劳力进行大变工，多做多顶分，这是农业和战勤结合的一个方面。
    在农副结合方面是表现在变工上边，如纺织是纺十二两花折农业一个工，织一丈布折一个农业工，妇女可以专事纺织，手工业则按工资折农业十六分上下，给他做活互助组多赚三分工资，这样两者都不耽误，都不吃亏。就在下种期间，木工并没有停止工具的生产。
    运输赚钱的统一分红，这是三大结合的集中表现。他们为了奖励互助的集体劳力与外出运输劳力，进行二八分红，又为奖励参战劳力，按剩余工分红。办法是出外运输的分，家里土地由互助组种，他出互助组工资，赚下的钱除了盘费，运输劳力分红利的八成，在家劳力按在组的集体工数，参战劳力，除自己代耕用工，按剩余工数，都按工分红二成，这办法出外劳力可以节省盘费开支，又奖励集体与参战劳力，这是这个办法的好处。
    三者结合的另一表现，是劳力的统一使用。当突击下种农业劳力不够使用时，副业劳力六十三个（大小合作工厂）就放假参加下种，但当农业不甚忙时，农业劳力又抽二十个人二十头牲口运输赚洋八十一万元（春耕中）。即在劳力的使用方面，也尽量发挥各种劳力的作用，如让全劳力做重活，半劳力辅助劳力做手头生活，这样全劳力顶到十二分，儿童亦顶了大人使，如排党参秧，儿童比大人还快，在运粮时，更有一个劳力担到九十斤折十五分的，牲口有驮到一百三四十斤折十七八分的，这样也大大提高了劳动效率，促进了结合的发展。
    三大结合，又促进了农业互助上的发展，进行互助包工。他们作了更集中的使用劳力，增强劳动强度，在三大结合的基础上，为适应锄苗夏收的紧张情况，进行了锄苗大包工。当锄苗开始时，干部感到生活挤到一块，但副业农业生活是一样也不能耽误，计算五百七十亩金皇后棉花怎样也得十二天，只有在农业上更加省工，才有剩余劳力进行副业生产。在这样情况下，劳英刘生才的小组首先出现包工锄苗十九亩，每亩平均省六分工，当夜就把这一办法广播全村，接着三个大队全部推行起来了。包工的办法首先挨户评工，因为评工是关键，他们除规定一级标准：如金皇后每亩十分，棉花每亩三十分，但还须到地看具体条件（苗稀稠草大小地松紧）增减分数，组长是工头，生活死分活折。为奖励技术，规定了立功加工标准，最后长工按工分红，这样情绪大为高涨，十二天的计划五天即告完成，省工三百五十个，剩余劳力拉煤四十九车，运输赚洋十二万元，开荒三十余亩。拉煤亦采取一九分红办法，照顾一般与参战劳力，这样包工直接促使了纺织运输副业生产的发展。
    日前全村进行总结，计锄苗省工三百六十个，下种省工二千六百个，犁三遍的地九百八十二亩，耢耙三遍的一千一百一十八亩。去年没有参战还空了二百亩苗，今年一苗不缺，还早种一个节令，大家研究原因是：三里外担水没用整工，每日省工三十个，组织了八十个辅劳力顶了大事，其次是副业劳力参加突击下种。一致的意见是包工起了劲，过去锄地有四大官歇七十二磨拖（消磨之意），今年只留一袋烟了（只吸一次烟的意思）。往年一亩十分工，今年一工就锄亩半。
