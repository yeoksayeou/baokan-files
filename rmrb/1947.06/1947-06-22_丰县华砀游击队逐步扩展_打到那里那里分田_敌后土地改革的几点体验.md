(Our newspaper's dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu region on the 20th) Under the cover of the guerrilla forces, Fengxian and Hua-Dang (newly established county) in the Su-Lu-Yu area north of the Longhai Railway are enthusiastically carrying out land reform, returning land and grain, and engaging in counter-liquidation movements. The democratic government of Hua-Dang County is gradually extending alongside the guerrilla forces. Wherever the guerrilla force strikes, the democratic government expands. The guerrilla force attacks the enemy in the front, while the democratic government mobilizes the masses to distribute grain and land in the rear. As of May 16th, within twenty days, 280 villages have preliminarily completed land distribution. Democratic governments have been established in the suburbs of Fengxian and Dangshan, as well as around Zhouzhuang and Xinzhuang, less than a hundred miles from Xuzhou. After the masses obtained the fruits of victory, they established their own armed forces, formed land protection teams, and investigated and confiscated weapons from landlords, organizing themselves to protect their land and lives. Various organizations such as peasant associations, children's groups, and women's groups are also rapidly established and restored in the villages. Underground tunnels are widely dug in each village, connecting more than 200 villages. Under the control of our guerrilla forces, Fengxian County has extensively launched movements to return land and grain and to counter-liquidate. A certain district first launched a "storm-like" propaganda campaign. In each village, a large number of notices, slogans, and leaflets from the democratic government were posted, ensuring that every village had notices and everyone, including women and children, knew about them. Mass meetings were held at night to explain that the government firmly supports the masses. The land reform decree and the simplified law were posted on the doors of landlords. After establishing the power of the democratic government, administrative power was used to convene meetings of puppet Bao-Jia chiefs and landlords, ordering those who had illegally taken grain to return it, and those who had illegally taken land to return it. Those who returned grain and land were issued certificates of return, guaranteeing their safety. After the order was issued, landlords personally sought out farmers to return land and grain. Landlords from dozens of miles away kowtowed and begged farmers to accompany them to the district government to complete the formalities. In just ten days, the entire district was stirred up, and it has now been promoted throughout the county. (1) When the Jiang army occupied Dingtao last year, our cadres temporarily withdrew, and landlords and bad elements became rampant, killing many people. After the cadres returned, they killed several landlords who had committed heinous crimes, and the reactionary arrogance was suppressed. When land reform was first proposed, the masses did not move. One farmer said, "You are living nests, and we are dead nests. You can run, but we have wives, children, and families. If the situation changes, we cannot run." This shows that the masses did not move because they were worried about the situation getting worse, about the cadres leaving again, and about us not supporting them. Based on this demand from the masses, we swore to the masses that we would not leave the district and would live and die with them. We also stated that we would firmly support the masses, emphasized that land reform was a government decree, and asked the landlords to write insurance certificates to the masses. Then, during the investigation of concealed wealth, the landlords were detained. At this time, the masses' concerns were dispelled, and they rushed to the landlords' homes to actively move things and find "secret holes." The enthusiasm was unprecedented during the distribution of concealed wealth. (2) Supporting the masses is what the masses demand, and supporting the masses is the mass line, but some comrades have turned supporting the masses into coercive administrative orders, so the masses are not conscious. For example, when cadres asked the masses to find "secret holes," the masses ate sweet potatoes and dug radishes by the edges of caves without putting their hearts into it. When cadres found a suspicious place and asked the masses to dig, the masses dug a few times and then pushed back, saying that there were no landlord's belongings. The masses felt that it was not something they should want, and they were satisfied with giving a little. In fact, the masses had not really moved under our correct support. Therefore, supporting the masses should be bold support to relieve the masses' concerns, and to inspire the masses' consciousness as much as possible so that the masses can handle their own problems. (3) Thoroughly eliminating landlords is what the masses demand, but because some masses are not conscious enough or are confused by landlords, some still have pity for landlords. This requires cadres to firmly stand on the side of the masses, enlighten the masses' class consciousness based on the masses' past suffering and compare the masses' current life with the landlords'. When floating wealth was distributed in Youlu Bridge in Dingtao, some of the masses said when they gave the landlord "something left behind": "He can't work, how can he live with so little?" But after the distribution was over, when the masses compared their own things, they were far behind the landlord's wealth. The landlord still had a lot of hidden wealth that had not been found. At this time, the masses' consciousness naturally improved. An old poor peasant woman in Wangzhuang, Dingtao, recalled her past suffering and pointed to the landlord, saying, "You must be punished like this." If we do not thoroughly compare the masses' floating wealth with the landlords' wealth, and inspire the masses to further investigate, the landlord's surface floating wealth is easy to obtain, while the underground wealth is more difficult to obtain. Exchanging houses with the landlord is not only about returning the house, but also making it easier for the underground wealth to fall into the hands of the masses. (4) In the guerrilla environment behind enemy lines, the masses are afraid of being isolated, and the policy of relying on the middle peasants must be strictly implemented. The poor peasants of Tianlu Bridge voluntarily proposed to unite with the middle peasants. In the land reform, the main solution is to solve the lives of the extremely poor peasants, and the property should be distributed to the poor peasants in most cases. The middle peasants can also be given a little less. (5) The distribution of fruits must follow the mass line. In Wangyankou, Dingtao, the fruits were handled by the masses. Whoever wanted what was proposed, and everything was registered. Then, based on the actual items, a discussion was held, one person by one person, and one item by one item. Although it was more troublesome, the masses were very satisfied after the distribution, and it was in line with the spirit of filling in the gaps and making up for the deficiencies. Most of the things were distributed to the poor peasants.

　　丰县华砀游击队逐步扩展
    打到那里那里分田
    敌后土地改革的几点体验
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】陇海路北苏鲁豫丰县、华砀（新设县）在游击队掩护下，热烈进行土地改革，还地还粮、反倒算运动。华砀县民主政权跟随游击队逐步伸展，游击队打到那里，民主政权扩展到那里，游击队在前面进击敌人，民主政府在后面发动群众分粮分地，截至五月十六日，二十天内已有二百八十个村子初步完成分田。丰县、砀山城郊及周庄新庄周围，距徐州不及百里已建立民主政权，群众分得果实后，纷纷建立自己的武装，成立保田队，清查出地主武器，组织起来保田保命，村内农会、儿童团、姐妹团等各种组织亦迅速建立与恢复，各村普遍挖地道，二百余村村村相连。丰县在我游击队控制下，广泛展开还地还粮反倒算运动。某区首先展开“刮大风”式的宣传，每到一村，大量贴出民主政府的布告标语传单，做到村村有布告，妇孺皆知。或夜间召开群众会，说明政府坚决给群众撑腰，把土地改革法令约法三章，贴到地主门上。建立民主政府威力之后，即利用行政力量，召集伪保甲长地主会议，勒令倒粮者还粮，倒地者还地，还粮还地者并发给还粮还地证，有还粮还地证者群众保证其生命安全。命令颁布后，地主纷纷亲自找农民还地还粮，数十里外之地主，叩头乞求农民伴同到区政府清理手续，前后仅十天，即轰动全区，现已推动全县。（一）去年蒋军占领定陶时，我们干部暂时退出，因此地主坏蛋猖狂起来，杀了许多人。干部插回去后，把罪大恶极的地主杀了几个，反动气焰才算镇压下去。开始提出土地改革时，群众不动，有一个农民说：“你们是活窝子，我们是死窝子，你们能跑，我们有老婆孩子有家，情况变了不能跑”。这说明群众不动是有顾虑，怕情况变坏，怕干部又走了，怕我们不给撑腰。我们就根据群众这种要求，向群众宣誓，保证区不离区，与群众共生死，并表明坚决给群众撑腰，强调土地改革是政府法令，叫地主向群众写保险证，接着在查浮财时又把地主扣起来。这时群众顾虑解除，一拥而上，到地主家积极搬东西，主动找“密洞”。分浮财时情绪空前高涨。（二）撑腰是群众要求，撑腰也就是群众路线，但有的同志却把撑腰变为强迫包办的行政命令，因此群众没有自觉，如干部叫群众找“密洞”，群众到地井子边吃红薯，刨萝卜，无所用心，干部找个可疑地方叫群众挖，群众掘几下就推拖说没有地主的财物，群众觉着不是应该要的，多少给点就满足了，实际上是群众还没在我们正确的撑腰下真正动起来，因此撑腰应是大胆撑腰解除群众顾虑下，尽可能启发群众自觉，使群众自己处理自己问题。（三）彻底消灭地主是群众要求，但由于某些群众觉悟不够或受地主迷惑，有的对地主还有怜悯，这就要干部坚决站到群众立场，根据群众过去痛苦，根据群众现在生活与地主比较，启发群众阶级觉悟。定陶由鹿桥分浮财时部分群众给地主“留”东西时说：“他这人都不会劳动，留这少怎么过”？但等分完了，群众拿着自己东西一比，还远赶不上地主的财力，地主还有许多暗财没搞出来，这时，群众觉悟自然提高了。定陶王庄一个贫农老大娘回忆起自己过去的痛苦，指着地主说：“就得这样报应你”，如不彻底拿群众的浮财与地主比较，启发群众进一步清查，地主的表面浮财好搞而地下财富比较难搞，与地主换房子不仅是房子应该还家，而且也使地下财富好落在群众手里。（四）在敌后游击环境下群众是怕孤立的，必须严格执行中农政策，田鹿桥贫农自愿提出联合中农，土地改革中主要解决赤贫农生活，财产应绝大部分分到贫民手里，中农也可少分点。（五）分果实要走群众路线，在定陶王堰口果实是群众处理，谁要啥都提出来，都登记上，然后根据实有的东西评议，一个人一个人的讨论，一件一件的分，虽较麻烦，但分好以后群众都很满意，而且也合乎填平补齐的精神，绝大部分东西都分到贫农手中。     （冀鲁豫分社）
