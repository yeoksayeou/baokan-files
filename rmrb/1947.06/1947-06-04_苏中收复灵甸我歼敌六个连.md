　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd—The local armed forces of the Ninth Sub-district of Suzhong, located in an area under severe "encirclement and suppression" by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, achieved a surprising victory. On the morning of the 30th, they annihilated six companies of Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in one fell swoop. This was an unprecedented major victory for the local armed forces in holding out against the Chiang Kai-shek "encirclement and suppression" area for the past seven months. They recovered Lingdian Town, an important stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek troops on the eastern bank of the Yangtze River in Haimen (20 miles east of Haimen). The battle lasted only three hours, and all six companies of the defending enemy, as well as the Xu Rong unit of the Chiang Kai-shek Jiangsu Provincial Pacification First Independent Regiment and the Jiangsu Provincial Security Fourth Brigade that came to reinforce from Haimen, were wiped out. According to preliminary statistics, over 400 enemy soldiers from company commander and platoon leader down were captured, and over 40 enemy soldiers from battalion commander down were killed or wounded. Two 38-type machine guns, 31 light machine guns, and over 200 rifles were seized, completely disrupting the Chiang Kai-shek troops' deployment for "encirclement and suppression" of Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong. The leaders of the Suzhong Military Region issued a special order to commend the victory.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd—As the new wheat harvest approaches, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime in Suzhong is attempting to seize grain on a large scale. In Dongtai, Fu'an, Liangduo, and other places, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime has gathered a large number of artisans to rush-produce麻袋 (ma dai) and other items, preparing to go to the countryside to seize wheat ears. In Haimen and Qi, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime has also made over a thousand wheat rakes in strongholds such as Nanyang Village, Haifu, and Juxing. They have also posted announcements, forcibly gathering the masses to hold meetings, and propagating that "the wheat of cadres and militiamen will be confiscated, while poor and hired peasants will have no problem as long as they pay rent," in order to paralyze the basic masses and divide the relationship between cadres and the masses. The Chiang Kai-shek government in the Dong'an stronghold of Rugao has openly established a "Rent Collection and Land Restoration Committee," concentrating feudal bullies, local tyrants, Chiang Kai-shek puppet forces, and other armed forces to organize "Rent Collection and Land Restoration Teams" in various villages. They are adopting methods such as "armed rent collection," "rent collection in lieu of donations," "grain borrowing in lieu of rent," and "three-three division" (i.e., Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, landlords, and peasants divide equally) to plunder in disguised forms. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime is frantically wasting production materials everywhere. In Dongtai, Libao, @cha and other strongholds, the Chiang Kai-shek troops have cut down all the green wheat within three to five miles around, and released dozens of horses to graze and trample on the wheat in the fields. This month, when the enemy "swept" Wuyuan Township in Rudong, in addition to destroying more than 40 mu of wheat fields, they also destroyed water conservancy facilities and other agricultural implements urgently needed for summer cultivation. The peasants in various places have been devastated by this destruction and have unanimously shouted the slogan "Fight resolutely for ten months of food," and are vigorously launching a struggle to seize and plant crops.

　　苏中收复灵甸我歼敌六个连
    【新华社华中二日电】处于蒋军严重“清剿”地区之苏中九分区地方武装出奇制胜，于三十日上午一举歼灭蒋伪军六个连，获得七个月来地方武装坚持蒋后“清剿”区之空前大捷，收复海门东沿江之蒋军重要据点灵甸镇（海门东二十里），战斗仅三小时，守敌及自海门来援之蒋记江苏省绥靖第一独立团徐容部及江苏省保安四大队共六个连全部就歼。据初步统计，俘敌连长中队长以下四百余人，毙伤其营长以下四十余人，缴三八机枪二挺，轻机枪三十一挺，步枪二百余支，使蒋军“清剿”南（通）如（皋）海（门）启（东）之部署全盘紊乱，苏中军区首长特传令嘉奖。
    【新华社华中二日电】新麦登场，苏中蒋伪企图大规模抢粮。东台、富安、梁垛等地蒋伪集合大批工匠赶制麻袋等，准备下乡抢收麦穗。海门、启军蒋伪亦在南阳村、海复、聚兴等据点制就麦扒千余只。并张贴布告，强拉群众开会，宣传“干部民兵麦子一律没收，贫雇农只要交租没有问题”，以麻痹基本群众，分化干部群众关系。如皋东安据点蒋记政府，公开成立“收租复田委员会”，集中封建恶霸土著蒋伪等武装，在各乡组织“收租复田队”，采取“武装收租”，“收租代捐”，“借粮代租”，“三三分收”（即蒋伪、地主、农民平分）等方式，变相抢掠。同时，各地蒋伪又疯狂糟踏生产物。东台、李堡、＠茶等据点蒋军将周围三、五里内青麦全部砍光，并放数十匹马下田啃麦、践踏。本月敌“扫荡”如东五袁乡时，除毁麦田四十余亩外，更破坏水利等夏耕急用农具。各地农民遭此摧残，已一致喊出“为十个月口粮而坚决斗争”的口号，正猛烈展开抢收抢种斗争。
