Xinhua News Agency, Central Jiangsu, 15th.林德明 (Lin Deming), Secretary of the Rudong (Rugao) County Party Committee in Central Jiangsu, reported on the county's experience in launching a mass self-defense movement:

(1) To counter the current concerns of cadres, conduct emergency mobilization, implement "resolution campaigns," and lay a solid ideological foundation for perseverance. At the beginning of the counter-"suppression," based on preliminary mobilization, and taking advantage of brief respites, conduct in-depth mobilization with the themes of "We can definitely persevere, we can definitely counter-attack, and we can definitely win," breaking down the individual's "fear of Chiang" stemming from the belief that "Chiang's army is strong" and "the returning home corps are fierce," the purely military viewpoint of relying on the main force and fighting to persevere, and the pessimistic view that "there is no way to persevere." Widely publicize the individual, spontaneous anti-Chiang struggles of the masses, laying a solid belief that perseverance must rely on the masses. Then discuss specific fighting methods, and finally, from the County Party Committee down to the district and township cadres, take an oath: "We will live or die with Rudong!" From the cadres, this influenced the basic masses, sparking "resolution campaigns" everywhere, involving chickens being sacrificed for pledges of alliance, and the determination to live and die together. At the same time, the Organization Minister of the Regional Party Committee went down to be the County Secretary, some county cadres were assigned to districts, some District Committee members went down to the townships as township instructors, and female comrades who were familiar with the situation also went down separately. The masses generally reflected, "This way, the higher-ups are determined to persevere."

(2) Emphasize tightly maintaining the organization so it isn't scattered, maintaining close contact between upper and lower levels, and standing firm. - In the most tense situations, superiors and subordinates, cadres and the masses, disregarded wind and rain, "meeting every day, touching base every night," and "educating at every meeting." This way, cadres and the masses were never deceived by the situation, and the difficulties in the struggle were resolved at any time. For example, female comrade He Wei of Jing'an District visited homes to offer comfort on rainy nights in villages after the enemy's "encirclement," moving the masses, who regarded her as family.

(3) At all times, grasp the emotions of the masses, solve the actual difficulties of the masses, and unite against the enemy. Village cadres meet with the masses every day, and move with the masses in an organized manner. When the enemy comes, analyze the situation and study fighting methods; when the masses suffer from Chiang's disasters, promptly launch mutual assistance and mutual aid to solve actual difficulties. In this way, cadres and the masses inspire and supervise each other, share weal and woe, and go out to strike at the enemy at any time.

(4) Through the mass meritorious service movement, popularize and improve the mass self-defense movement. Using the intervals between enemy "stationing and suppression" and "joint suppression," conduct inspections and summaries. The leadership consciously publicized the various creations of the mass anti-Chiang struggle by holding mass meetings, staging plays, and giving commendations, and criticized wavering elements. Launch a meritorious service movement among cadres and the masses, using commendations to inspire mass morale; using evaluations to improve mass understanding; using awards to popularize influence; and using record-keeping to show solemnity. Thus, the mass anti-Chiang struggle was expanded, from individual to general, from low-level to high-level, from individuals to a civic group, a village, and a township.

(5) Combine labor and military affairs to sustain the mass anti-Chiang struggle. After the masses' struggle ideology was determined and they started fighting, resolving the contradiction between production and struggle became a universal demand of the masses. Therefore, organizational forms and activities that combined labor and military affairs emerged. For example, the militia work-accompaniment team near the Gongjiaqiao stronghold. The masses in Jing'an District spontaneously organized a 2,000-person iron fork team. In the defense of the wheat harvest, armed work-accompaniment groups were widely organized, gradually raising the mass struggle to armed struggle.

　　如东县委书记总结自卫经验
    【新华社苏中十五日电】苏中蒋后如（皋）东县委书记林德明报导该县发动群众自卫运动的经验：
    （一）针对干部当前顾虑，进行紧急动员，贯彻“决心运动”，打下坚持的思想基础。反“清剿”开始时，在初步动员基础上，利用短促空隙，进行“一定能坚持，一定能反攻，一定能胜利”的深入动员，打破了个别的认为“蒋军力量大”、“还乡团凶”的恐蒋病，依赖主力与打仗来坚持的单纯军事观点，及“没法坚持”的悲观论调。把群众的反蒋个别自发斗争广为传扬，打下坚持一定要依靠群众的坚固信念。然后讨论具体斗争办法，最后由县委起至区乡干一齐宣誓：“生死不离如东！”由干部影响到基本群众，到处掀起杀鸡盟誓，生死同心的“决心运动”。同时，地委组织部长下去做县书，县干一部配备至区，区委一部下乡做乡指导员，熟悉情况的女同志也分别下去，这样群众普遍反映说：“这样子，上面决心要坚持的。”
    （二）强调紧紧的掌握组织不被打散，上下密切联系，站稳脚根。——在情况最紧张时，上级与下级，干部与群众做到不避风雨，“天天见面、夜夜碰头”，“见面就教育。”这样，干部与群众随时都不被情况所迷惑，斗争中的困难随时得到解决。如景安区女同志何畏在敌“围剿”后的庄子里，风雨之夜，挨户慰问，群众感动，视若家人。
    （三）随时掌握群众情绪，解决群众实际困难，齐心对敌。乡村干天天与群众见面，与群众一起有组织的转移。敌人一来就分析情况，研究斗争办法；群众受了蒋灾，随时发动互助互济，解决实际困难。这样干部与群众互相激励，互相监督，共患难，同甘苦，随时出去打击敌人。
    （四）通过群众立功运动，普及与提高群众自卫运动。利用敌“驻剿”“会剿”间隙，进行检查总结，领导上有意识的把群众反蒋斗争的各种创造通过群众开会演戏表扬普及，并批评动摇分子，发动干部与群众的立功运动，由报功来启发群众斗志；由评功来提高群众认识；由表功来普及影响；由记功来表示郑重。从而把群众的反蒋斗争扩展开去，由个别到一般，由低级到高级，由个人到一个公民组、一个村、一个乡。
    （五）劳武结合，使群众反蒋斗争持续下去。在群众斗争思想确定了并斗起来后，解决生产与斗争的矛盾便成为群众普遍的要求。因此，劳武结合的斗争组织形式与活动便产生了。如龚家桥据点附近之民兵伴工队。景安区群众自动组织了二千人的铁叉队。在保卫麦收中，普遍组织武装伴工组，使群众斗争逐渐提高到武装斗争。
