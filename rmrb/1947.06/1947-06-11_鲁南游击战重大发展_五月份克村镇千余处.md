Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 8th. Guerrilla warfare here has seen new developments in May. According to incomplete statistics, local armed forces, militias, and guerrilla units in central Shandong coordinated with the main forces in operations, engaging in 73 battles of various sizes in the latter half of May, eliminating over 500 enemies. In the coastal area, there were over 60 engagements throughout the month, resulting in 582 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers (from the rank of deputy battalion commander and below) and local despots killed, 923 enemies captured, 3 vehicles seized, and 7 puppet district public offices destroyed, completely altering the enemy-our-situation in the area north of Linyi, Tancheng, and the Longhai Railway. In early May, the military and civilians of the coastal and southern Shandong areas, taking advantage of the main forces of Chiang Kai-shek's army in Linyi advancing north, captured enemy strongholds such as Huabu and Gaoshanzi in one fell swoop, cutting off the Lin (Yi) - Tan (Cheng) highway. Militias and work teams along the road cooperated in carrying out explosions. The Gao Guangzhen explosion team alone planted mines three times, destroying eight enemy vehicles and killing more than 50 enemy soldiers. In mid-May, they removed strongholds near Huan Dunpu and Broken Stone Bridge on the Lin (Yi) - Qing (kou) highway north of the Longhai Railway, and recovered more than 700 towns and villages. Another unit of local armed forces attacked 3,000 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers harassing from Tancheng southwest of the Yi River, killing, wounding, and capturing over 100 enemies (from the rank of deputy company commander and below), while the unit only suffered one death and twelve injuries. More than 200 villages and towns in the Zhu Chen area southwest of Linyi City and 320 villages east of the Taitan (Taierzhuang to Tanxian) highway east of the city have been completely controlled by the people's armed forces. In May, the local armed forces and guerrillas in central Shandong harassed large enemy forces invading along the Xin (Tai) - Lai (Wu) highway more than 60 times. Chiang Kai-shek's troops were constantly stepping on landmines and were exhausted. After the great victory of Menglianggu, the guerrillas became even more active due to the enemy's panic. The enemies in Xintai, Laiwu, and Mengyin were trapped in strongholds, blindly firing artillery at night to embolden themselves.
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 6th. The Central Shandong Military Region issued a comprehensive combat bulletin on the basic regiments (the backbone of local armed forces) for January, February, March, and April on the 25th of last month: in four months, they fought a total of 247 battles, captured two strongholds such as Chenjiazhuang, killed and wounded 383 Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops, captured 3,014, seized 2 75mm steel cannons, 3 82mm mortars, 6 60mm cannons, 2 rocket launchers, 3 grenade launchers, 83 light and heavy machine guns, 890 rifles, 59 Thompson submachine guns, 5,314 shells, 163,010 rounds of ammunition, 74 mules and horses, 33 telephones, 2 radio motors each, 19 pairs of binoculars, 5,997,500 Chiang currency, and more than 20,000 jin of grain.
