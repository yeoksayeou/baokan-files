Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 15th: In the Xu Kou border area and the Gou Tou central area of Ju'nan County, Bin Hai Region, mutual aid villages and mutual aid households were established to help people in the border areas transfer and store wheat. Since the Chiang army occupied Gou Tou (Linyi area), they have constantly invaded the western part of Xu Kou district. After the wheat harvest, the idea of "poor families are reluctant to leave their homes" hindered the active storage and protection of grain. Some people were also worried that they would have no houses to live in and no houses to store grain after the transfer. During this wheat harvest, 2,700 people from Gou Tou district rushed to the area day and night to help harvest. It was decided to appropriately match the villages and people in the two districts according to their size and kinship, and establish mutual aid villages and mutual aid households to carry out education on "unity, friendship, and mutual assistance in times of difficulty." The people of Xu Kou district transferred their grain, property, and families to Gou Tou district. When there are no special circumstances, young and middle-aged people return home to defend production with arms; during the busy farming season, Gou Tou district organizes labor to help the people of Xu Kou district return home to harvest, plant, and weed in a timely manner. This method has been successfully tested in Zhang Jia Guan Zhuang in Xu Kou district and Jin Gou Guan Zhuang in Gou Tou district. The people of Bei Ji village also automatically established a mutual aid village with Tuan Bu village in Gou Tou district.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: In various places behind Chiang, the military and civilians are working day and night to harvest, combining labor and military affairs, under the slogan of "Protecting the fields and wheat is protecting your life." Most of the new wheat in Zi Shi, Ru Dong, Tai Bei and other places is now on the market, and the harvest rate is around 70%; Tang Yuan area, which is known as the "Ukraine of Central Jiangsu," has also had a bumper harvest this year. The agencies and troops in Central Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu are all helping the people with the wheat harvest. A certain detachment of the Central Jiangsu People's Liberation Army, led by its leaders, helped harvest more than 500 mu. The county regiments of Dongtai, Zi Shi, and other counties have all spent three full days helping with the harvest. The direct team of the Hai Prefecture Sub-district of Northern Jiangsu also seized the gap between battles to help the masses harvest for six days, cutting more than 2,000 mu of wheat. The county magistrate of Dongtai Democratic Government also personally led cadres to help with the harvest, which was deeply supported by the masses.

　　滨海莒南县创建互助村
    帮助边地群众藏麦
    华中丰收新麦大部登场
    【新华社山东十五日电】滨海区莒南县许口边沿，沟头中心两区群众，建立互助村、互助户帮助边沿群众转移藏麦。自蒋军侵占沟头（临沂地）后，不断出犯许口区西部，群众麦收后，“穷家难舍”的思想阻碍了积极藏粮护粮，有的并顾虑转移后无屋可住，无屋藏粮。此次麦收时，沟头区二千七百于群众星夜赶赴该区帮助抢收，并决定根据两区村庄大小及群众亲戚关系适当配搭，建立互助村、互助户，双方进行“团结友爱困难相助”的教育。许口区群众把粮食家业家属转移到沟头区，无情况时，青壮年回家武装保卫生产；农忙时沟头区组织劳力帮助许口区群众回家抢收抢种抢锄。此办法已在许口区张家官庄和沟头区金沟官庄实验成功。北集村群众亦自动向沟头区团埠村建立互助村。
    【新华社华中十六日电】此间蒋后各地军民在“保田保麦就是保命”口号下劳武结合昼夜抢收。现紫石、如东、台北等地新麦大部登场，收成均在七成上下；素以苏中乌克兰著称之汤园地区今亦获丰收。苏中、苏北机关部队均全力助民麦收。苏中人民解放军某支队在首长率领下，助收五百余亩。东台、紫石等各县团均以三整日时间助收，苏北的海分区直属队亦抓紧战斗空隙帮助群众抢收六天，割麦二千多亩，东台民主政府县长亦亲率干部助收，深得群众拥护。
