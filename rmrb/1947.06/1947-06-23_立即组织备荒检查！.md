　　Immediately Organize Famine Preparedness Inspections!
　　Comrade Editor:
　　Recently, the newspaper has repeatedly called for famine preparedness and thrift. Local agencies and the masses have responded one after another. However, in order to make this work better and thoroughly implement it in every village and household, leaders at all levels should conduct more in-depth and specific inspections. I saw the following phenomenon in Shahe, Xishu and other villages in the Third District of She County: On the one hand, the district and village constantly hold meetings to call for eating more bran and vegetables to save for famine preparedness; on the other hand, looking at the people's food market, every day at noon, 70% to 80% are still eating white flour. My landlord has been eating a meal of white flour every day since the wheat harvest. I have done some research on this situation and believe that there are the following ideological reasons, which I propose for everyone's consideration:
　　1. Fear of struggle: Some rich peasants have the idea that "what is eaten is pure profit." They don't take the call for famine preparedness and thrift seriously. These people should be given more education.
　　2. Relying on Heaven, blindly waiting for rain: Some stubborn and honest peasants hold the belief that "it doesn't matter if it rains heavily in ten or eight days, we'll talk about it if it doesn't rain for a month and a half." These people also feel that if it doesn't rain, it's terrible and they are anxious, but they don't actively think of ways to respond to the government's call. These people urgently need specific help to get through their thinking and draw up a famine preparedness and thrift plan, and they should be specifically inspected, not left to their own devices.
　　3. Sticking to conventions: The general public believes: "After the summer harvest, we should eat well for a few days. We worked hard for May, can't we eat two good meals!" "We hired people to harvest and help, how can we bring out coarse food?" "Can't we visit relatives after the summer harvest?" Therefore, under this series of reasons, it is necessary to spend wheat. Every family does this, and every village does this. The waste is astonishing when calculated. Therefore, we should educate people to break conventions, advocate thrift, and mobilize people to exchange wheat for coarse grains mixed with bran and vegetables, think long-term, and overcome famine.
　　Based on the above situation, my opinion is that the district and village leaders should provide the masses with specific methods, provide past famine years' famine preparedness and thrift experience, and absorb the good experiences of other places published in the newspapers, help the masses to make plans for each family, think of more ways, launch competitions with each other to see who does well, and put this matter in an important position in the meritorious service movement. At certain times, we should summarize and select famine preparedness and thrift models, and criticize and oppose the bad phenomenon of those who don't save, eat and drink heavily, don't plan for the long term, and live one day at a time.

### 立即组织备荒检查！

　　立即组织备荒检查！
    编辑同志：
    近来报上一再号召备荒节约，各地机关和群众已纷纷响应，但是为了使这一工作做得更好，深入贯彻到每村每户，各级领导应做更深入的具体检查。我在涉县三区沙河、西戍等村看到有这样一种现象：一方面区村不断开会号召多吃糠菜节约备荒；另一方面在老百姓饭市上看，每天晌午总有十之七、八还在吃白面，我住的房东，麦收以来天天吃一顿白面。我对这种情况做了一些调查，认为有以下几种思想原因，提出供大家研究：
    一、怕斗争思想，一些富农存在有：“吃了是净落”的思想。对于备荒节约号召，他们不当回事，对这种人主要应多加教育。
    二、靠天吃饭，盲目等雨。一些疙瘩户老实农民，抱着：“十来八天落透雨还不要紧，要是一月半月不下雨再说。”这种人他们也觉得不下雨了不起，着急的慌，可是对政府的号召他们也不积极想办法。这种人急需具体帮助他们打通思想，订出备荒节约计划，而且要具体检查，不要听其自流。
    三、墨守成规：一般群众认为：“收了夏就该好吃几天，忙个五月还不吃两顿！”“咱用人收割帮忙，赖的怎能端出来？”“收了夏还能不看亲戚？”于是乎在这一串理由下，就非开销麦子不行。家家这样，村村这样，计算起来浪费就很惊人。所以应教育打破成规，提倡省俭，动员把麦子换成杂粮掺糠搅菜，从长期着想，战胜灾荒。
    根据以上这种情况，我的意见区村领导同志应当多给群众提出具体办法，提供过去灾荒年的备荒节约经验，并吸收报上登的其他地方的好经验，帮助群众家家订出计划，要多想办法，互相展开竞赛，看谁做的好，把这件事也放在立功运动中的重要地位，一定时候总结选拔备荒节约模范，批评反对那种不节约大吃二喝，不长期打算，过一天说一天的二流子坏现象。               读者  范直
