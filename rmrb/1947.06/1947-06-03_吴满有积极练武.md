Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi Front, 31st – Wu Manyou, since joining the army on May 14th, is a soldier in the Northwest People's Liberation Army beloved by all officers and soldiers.

　　The second day after joining the army, he put on his grass-green military uniform and sat under a large tree, actively practicing martial arts. With his hands, which for over forty years had been accustomed to holding hoes and plows, he awkwardly gripped the new Zhongzheng rifle "sent" by Hu Zongnan. Bullets were pressed into the chamber one by one, then taken out one by one. He lay prone on the grass for a long time, aiming at the distance, practiced for a while, then sat up and laughed loudly. After practicing martial arts, he leaped onto the chestnut-colored foreign horse captured in the Panlong battle, giving it free rein to gallop on the Yan River beach. At dusk, Wu Manyou returned to camp, and greeted all acquaintances with a customary handshake. Although his short black beard was already mixed with a few strands of white, the wrinkles on his forehead seemed to have decreased instead.

　　In the evening, Wu Manyou leaned over the green oil lamp, enthusiastically listening to the propaganda cadre explain "Soldier's Readings." He asked what qualities a combat hero should possess, and how to "become a model combatant." After hearing the replies, he couldn't help but laugh naively, repeatedly saying, "This must be done with effort."

　　Another day, Wu Manyou went to General Wang Zhen's headquarters to visit General Wang Zhen. They embraced warmly upon meeting, and sat on a kang for a long talk all day long. General Wang Zhen repeatedly stroked Old Wu's short beard, discussing rural wartime mobilization and class relations, etc., and Wu Manyou was able to answer these complex questions with simple words and the facts before him. They were old friends in production; when Wang Zhen's troops reclaimed Nanniwan in 1943, Wu Manyou was a production teacher welcomed by the commanders and fighters of General Wang Zhen's unit. Today, in order to defeat the people's enemies Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, Old Wu is once again a combatant in their ranks.

　　吴满有积极练武
    【新华社陕北前线三十一日电】吴满有五月十四日参军后，是西北人民解放军中一个被全体官兵敬爱的战士。
    他参军第二天，即穿上草绿色军装，坐在大树下积极练武，用他四十多年来握惯了＠头、犁耙的手，生硬的握着胡宗南“送”来的新中正式步枪。子弹被一粒一粒的按进膛去，又一粒一粒的拿出来。他长久地伏在草地上向远处瞄准，练了一阵又坐起来放声大笑。练了武，他又纵身骑上蟠龙战斗中缴获的栗色大洋马，放缰奔驰在延水滩上。黄昏了，吴满有才息马回营，遇着所有熟人，他很习惯地和大家握手。虽然他短短的黑胡须已经夹杂着少许白色，但他额上绉纹却似乎反而减少了。
    晚间，吴满有伏在青油灯下，兴致勃勃地倾听宣传干事讲解“战士读物”。他问战斗英雄要具备那些条件，以及怎样“成为一个模范战斗员”。听罢别人的答复，他不禁天真的大笑起来，连声说：“这一定要努力做到”。
    又一天，吴满有去王震将军司令部拜会王震将军，他们一见面就亲切地拥抱，坐在一个炕上长谈竟日。王震将军几次抚摸老吴的短胡须，和他谈论农村战时动员和阶级关系等问题，吴满有均能用浅近的字句和眼前的事实答复这些复杂的问题。他们本是生产中的老朋友，当一九四三年王震部队开垦南泥湾时，吴满有是一位备受王震将军所部指战员欢迎的生产教师，今天为着战胜人民公敌蒋介石、胡宗南，老吴又是他们队伍中的一名战斗员了。
