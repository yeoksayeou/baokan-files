　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. Local armed militias in Suzhong are advancing into the border areas to launch a wheat protection campaign. In the past 20 days, they have struck at Chiang Kai-shek's troops who were looting wheat more than 150 times, killing over 200 enemies and seizing 8 machine guns, 60 rifles, and 3 boxes of bullets. Two local armed detachments fought 51 battles in 14 days from the 9th to the 23rd of last month. On the 22nd, the Dongtai Independent Regiment raided two strongholds on the Hai'an-Dongtai section of the Tongyu Highway, cutting all the wires within 80 miles. The Dongtai North and South guerrilla teams penetrated the Chiang Kai-shek troops' encirclement and fought 31 battles in 10 days. The Caoyan Guerrilla Team in North Tai repelled seven groups of Chiang Kai-shek troops looting grain in one day and captured an enemy grain-looting boat. The local armed forces of Jiangdu are active on both sides of the Guanh River on the Yangzhou-Taixing line. On the 7th, they intercepted three ships sailing from Taizhou, capturing Feng Songtao, the head of Chiang's Xinghua intelligence group, and others, enabling the masses in the border areas to harvest their wheat with peace of mind and to transplant rice seedlings. In the Zishi County of Xinghua, located in a water network area, a dam-building movement and mine warfare are underway to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's troops from looting grain. The local armed forces of Taixing County completely annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek Self-Defense Force looting grain in Pian'gang Township on the 26th.
