Five Counties Along the Edge of Northern Yue
Half of the Villages in Major Movement
[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 19th] The land reform in the five counties of Pingyao, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, and Zhaocheng along the border area of Northern Yue has seen significant development since it was implemented in conjunction with guerrilla warfare in March. Out of the 874 villages in the five counties, 432 villages have launched struggles, accounting for approximately one-half of the total. Among them, 102 villages are nearing completion, and 230 villages are still engaged in struggles. Since liberation, over 85% of the villages in Huoxian and Zhaocheng have been drawn into the movement. Both counties have launched a powerful offensive against the enemy, fighting at the front and overturning the old order in the rear, fighting on one hand and overturning the old order on the other. Cadres have completely overcome the past view that land reform could not be carried out amidst gunfire, and have learned the dual skills of leading the masses in fighting and leading the masses in emancipation. Yan Daxin, director of the Armed Forces Committee of the Third District of Zhaocheng, militia heroes Zhang Yongsheng and Zhao Xiaosi; Zhang Yinba of Huoxian; district cadres Liu Laifan and Zhu Siyi of Lingshi; Cheng Zhongyi of Jiexiu; and Zhu Yaoba of Pingyao have all become dual-role heroes in this movement. Villages such as Jingjie and Chenjiashan in Lingshi, Shangliang in Jiexiu, and Yindi in Huoxian have all created examples of engaging in production while fighting. In more than four months, militia guerrillas have killed 2,032 enemies, and the militia alone have laid 4,000 mines, exploding 731 of them, killing or wounding 400 enemies. In terms of policy, special attention has been paid to uniting the middle peasants. Before the struggle, various localities have discussed the question of "who to struggle against and who will participate in the struggle," resulting in unprecedented unity within the peasantry and a strong and well-organized camp. Some areas have already created experience in deepening the movement. For example, Daojue Village in Zhaocheng completely handed over the policy to the masses, thereby enabling the rapid development of the movement. After a three-day upsurge of emancipation in Duzhuang, the "good enough" mentality was broken, and things were thoroughly pursued to the end, leading to the unearthing of many more issues. Dong Village in Lingshi also implemented methods of investigating class and ideology, further deepening the movement.

　　岳北边沿五县
    半数村庄大动
    【本报太岳十九日电】岳北边沿区平（遥）、介（休）、灵（石）、霍（县）、赵（城）五县的土地改革，自三月实行与游击战争结合以来，已有大的发展。五县八百七十四个村庄，已有四百三十二个村庄掀起了斗争，约占全数二分之一。其中一百零二个村庄已接近完成。二百三十个村庄犹在斗争。霍县、赵城自解放后，百分之八十五以上的村庄都卷入运动，两县均对敌实行了强大攻势，前方打仗，后方翻身，一面打仗，一面翻身，干部完全克服了过去认为在炮火中无法进行土地改革的观点，学会了领导群众打仗，又领导群众翻身的两套本领。赵城三区武委会主任阎大信，民兵英雄张永胜、赵小斯；霍县的张银巴；灵石的区干部刘来樊、朱思义；介休的程忠义；平遥的朱耀八都成了这一运动中的双料英雄。灵石的旌介、陈家山，介休的上梁，霍县的阴底等村，都创造了一面生产一面打仗的范例，四个多月中民兵游击队共杀敌二千零三十二人，仅民兵就埋雷四千颗，爆炸了七百三十一颗杀伤敌人四百名。在政策上特别注意了团结中农，各地在斗争前多讨论“斗争谁谁来斗争”的问题，使农民内部空前团结，阵营强大整齐。部分地区已创造了深入运动的经验。如赵城的道觉村，完全将政策交给群众，因而使运动迅速发展。杜庄经三天翻身高潮后，打破了“差不多”思想，一竿打到底，又斗出了许多东西。灵石的东村也实行了查阶级查思想办法，使运动更加深入。
