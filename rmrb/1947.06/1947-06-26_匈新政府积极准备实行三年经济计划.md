Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Comprehensive report: The new Hungarian government is actively preparing to implement a three-year economic plan. Following the exposure of the Nagy and others' conspiracy and the formation of the new government, it recently approved the three-year economic plan submitted by the Supreme Economic Council (Note: The plan is scheduled to begin on August 1st). The committee has now formed a planning department to prepare specific plans related to the three-year plan; the activities of all kinds of industrial enterprises across the country are included in the plan. At the same time, the nationalization of banks, which is the foundation for completing the three-year economic plan, is also being actively carried out. According to a United Press report, new Prime Minister Dinnyés has announced that several large banks will be nationalized. In addition, the Hungarian Trade Union Federation has also demanded the imposition of special taxes on the wealthy, price gougers, and war profiteers to ensure the financial basis of the three-year plan. Representatives of the Hungarian Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party also met a few days ago to discuss the three-year plan. Interior Minister László Rajk said at the meeting: "The three-year plan will soon become law, which is an important political victory." He called on the people to resist attempts by evil forces to undermine the plan.

[Another dispatch] The Hungarian trade delegation led by the Minister of Commerce and Cooperation, which visited the Soviet Union at the end of April, is still in the Soviet Union.
