Comrade Fan, the secretary of the Nangong County Committee, Director Zhang, and Secretary Zhao led the organ personnel to the fields, promoting a surge in planting among the masses stationed in the villages. When Comrade Zang of the Chengguan District Committee and District Head Zhang led the carrying of water for planting, more than 50 men and women from the Beiguan masses automatically organized to come to support, replanting cotton and planting beans. County Head Zhang of Feixiang helped the military family in Guojiabao water their garden and plant crops, and the militiamen, whose thinking had never been cleared, immediately planted together with the masses. The Second District Committee helped the military families and masses in Jiangzhai, Xiajin, plant more than 20 mu of cotton in three and a half days.
