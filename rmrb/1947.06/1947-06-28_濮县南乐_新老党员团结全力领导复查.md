Puyang County and Nanle County
	New and Veteran Party Members Unite to Fully Lead the Re-examination

	[Our newspaper's report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region on the 26th] Puyang and Nanle counties are promoting the re-examination with the branch as the core. The Puyang County Second District Committee first convened a meeting of all branch secretaries and village cadres in the district to convey the spirit of the re-examination. Subsequently, district cadres Comrades Yu Fapeng and Shi Tongshu went to Xinzhuangji and convened a branch general meeting. At the meeting, they discussed the situation of the impending large-scale counter-offensive and the methods employed by landlords, citing the example of landlords in Lüdi, Fan County, who used knives to kill village cadres. The Party members then began to deliberate. Generally, they believed that the leadership had not provided enough care in the past and had not given a helping hand, which had led to the lagging behind of the land reform. Finally, all the Party members unanimously agreed: "Everyone still has to do it, no matter what. Don't think the landlords are smiling at us; when Chiang's army comes, they won't spare us." After the branch's general meeting, six or seven meetings with veteran Party members were held. The main focus of these meetings was to examine why the past work had not been energetic and to allow everyone to express their grievances. After some prompting, everyone started talking. Comrade Wang ×× complained that the higher-ups had removed him from his position as chairman of the farmers' association without a word. Later, he found out that it was the work of a special agent, and he became less active afterward. Comrade Ge ×× said: "Since returning home from the army, the higher-ups have ignored me. I cried about it. Later, I wanted to work hard, but people wouldn't let me get close." Later, a meeting with some new and veteran Party members was held. The main purpose was to solve the problem of how to conduct the re-examination. At the meeting, everyone expressed: "As long as you let us old folks (old Party members) do it, just watch! We'll put on our glasses and look back! We'll definitely do a good job." Then everyone started talking about the hidden wealth of the landlords: Ge ×× knew about the landlord's second granary of grain, which he had personally seen forty villagers bury for the landlord. Then, one person said a little, and another person said a little, revealing a large amount of the landlord's hidden wealth. At that time, everyone also reflected on their own positions. Wang ×× revealed that he had preserved chairs and curtains for the landlord. Ge ×× revealed that he had stored the landlord's grain. At this time, everyone exposed the landlords' conspiracies of bribery and enticement. The landlords Wang Mengzhi and Wang Mengsong took out 20,000 yuan to bribe the chairman of the farmers' association, and Ge Kongqian also took out 20,000 yuan for the chairman of the farmers' association. Subsequently, a poor peasants' association meeting was convened, at which the issues raised by the branch were announced. From then on, the re-examination began to ferment among the poor peasants in the whole village. In Dongliang Village, Nanle County Second District, when deciding on the number of landlord households to be struggled against, the branch first held a meeting to discuss and decided on three target households. Then, the decision was handed over to the poor peasants' association for discussion. The result of the discussion was that four households should be struggled against. At this time, the branch held another meeting to discuss the opinions of the masses. As a result, they agreed with the opinions of the poor peasants and examined their own shortcomings in the original decision. Therefore, they acted with the branch as the core. During the action, when a certain Party member cadre went to drink with the landlord, the branch immediately launched an ideological struggle. When the masses gathered in front of the gate to struggle against the landlord Liang Dejun, they were afraid to move forward. Party member Liang ×× jumped out and led the way forward. Now, the branches of all villages are learning from the experience and methods of Dongliang Village.

　　濮县南乐
    新老党员团结全力领导复查
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】濮县、南乐以支部为核心，推动复查。濮县二区区委会首先召开了全区支部和村干会议，传达了复查的精神。接着，区干于法朋、史同书同志，分到辛庄集，召开了支部大会。会上，谈了目标准备大反攻的形势，又谈到地主活动的方式，引证了范县吕堤地主借刀杀村干部的例子。接着党员们即酝酿起来，一般认为：过去领导上关心不够，没有扶手，以致土改落了后。最后，全体党员一致认为：“大家还是非干不行，别看地主见了咱笑眯眯的，蒋军来了，饶不了咱。”支部党员大会以后，又召开了六、七个老党员会议。会上主要是检讨过去工作为啥不起劲，有啥苦水都可提出来。经过启发后，大家都谈起来。王××同志瞒怨上级为啥不吭一声就把自己的农会长撤了，以后自己才知道是特务捣的鬼，从此不积极了。葛××同志说：“自从在部队里回家以后，上级没理过，自己哭了一场。以后自己想在工作上积极努力，但人家不叫靠边。”后又召开一部分新老党员会议。主要是解决怎样进行复查的问题。会上大家表示：“只要叫俺这些老人（老党员）干，看吧，脑袋瓜子上戴眼镜，往后看！准要把工作搞好。”于是大家说起地主的浮财来：葛××知道地主的二囤粮食，是他亲眼看到村上四十个人给地主埋的。接着，这个说一点，那个说一点，说出了地主的大批浮财。当时，大家又在立场上进行了反省，王××说出给地主保存了椅子、帘子。葛××说出存着地主粮食。这时，大家揭破了地主收买利诱的阴谋手段，地主王梦芝、王梦松拿了二万元收买农会主任，葛孔铅也拿出二万元给农会主任。随后即召开了贫农会，会上宣布了支部提出来的问题。从此，复查在全村贫农里酝酿起来。南乐二区东梁村，在决定斗争地主的户数时，先由支部开会讨论，决议对象三家。接着又交贫农会议讨论，讨论的结果，认为有四户该斗。这时支部又开会，讨论群众的意见，结果同意了贫农的意见，并检讨了自己原来决议不够的地方。因此，即以支部为核心的行动起来。行动中，某党员干部与地主去喝酒，支部马上开展了思想斗争。斗争地主梁德俊，群众拥到大门前时，不敢往前，党员梁××，就跳出来，领着拥上去。现在，各村支部都学习东梁村的经验与办法。
