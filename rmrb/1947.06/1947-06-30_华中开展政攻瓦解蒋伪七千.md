Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th -- The military and civilians in Central China have launched a mass political work campaign aimed at exploiting the war-weariness and homesickness of Chiang Kai-shek's troops, with remarkable results. In the past four months, more than 5,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops have been disintegrated in various parts of northern Jiangsu. In southern Jiangsu, just according to statistics from ten counties including Nantong and Dongtai, more than 2,300 local Chiang Kai-shek troops returned home and surrendered in April and May. The number of Chiang Kai-shek troops deserting has also increased month by month. For example, in Tangyang District of Dongtai, only four people deserted in February, sixteen in March, and as many as eighty-nine in April. The experience of Nantong, Rudong, Haimen and Qidong in carrying out the "Erase Black Spots Movement" is: (1) To align the thinking of cadres and the masses, correct the general psychology of pure hatred, and recognize that it is because of our strong strength that they will submit and return. This is not appeasement, but leniency. At the same time, there is also a repressive side to those who are resolutely reactionary. "Erasing black spots" is not passive tolerance but active transformation. (2) The policy of leniency must become the policy of the masses themselves through the masses, which is to cure diseases and save people, not to deceive people into traps. Saving a lost person will reduce a scourge for the locality and weaken the enemy's strength, and will not increase the burden on the locality. (3) Winning over Chiang Kai-shek's troops to return must be discussed by the masses in advance to distinguish between right and wrong, seriousness and triviality, and treat them specifically. (4) In coordination with public security and anti-espionage work, resolutely crack down on those who are resolutely reactionary, and care for and educate those who return with awareness, so that they can make meritorious service to offset their crimes. When carrying out this movement in northern Jiangsu, various effective methods were adopted: (A) "Save the Dying Movement": The township established a "Save the Dying Committee", the village established a "Save the Dying Group", and a meeting of family members of puppet soldiers was held to explain that if they did not return home, they would inevitably be sent to their deaths for Chiang Kai-shek, and representatives were selected to try to save them. (B) "Persuasion to Return Group": Composed of elders or old women in the village, they went to the homes of family members of puppet soldiers to persuade them to call back their relatives. (C) "Choosing a Path Movement": Pointing out that there are three ways out for Chiang Kai-shek troops, one way to die; returning home, going to Jiangnan, and secretly doing things for the people are all ways to live. Resolutely being reactionary is a dead end. Select typical examples to make the distinction between life and death clear. (D) One-letter movement: The government, local gentry and family members simultaneously wrote letters of persuasion, so that every member of the "Homecoming Corps" could receive at least one letter. (E) Establish "Surrender Reception Centers" or "Welcome Stations", distribute "Surrender Certificates", indicating that upon arrival at a certain place, travel expenses can be collected to return home. After the members of the "Homecoming Corps" return home, they are given individual or collective education (such as opening training classes, etc.) to encourage them to make meritorious service for the people and persuade other Chiang Kai-shek elements to return home. At the same time, help them settle down and produce.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th -- The Third Company of New Recruits of a certain unit of the Central Jiangsu People's Liberation Army, which was reorganized from Chiang's troops, has been grasping ideological education and carrying out the "Rubbing Backs Movement", with remarkable results. The company was originally a local armed force and was promoted to the main force in March this year. Initially, the new soldiers were not accustomed to life in the army, and some cadres also had this phenomenon. Eighty percent of the soldiers in the whole company were in low spirits. The newly appointed instructor first mobilized the soldiers to raise opinions to the cadres and resolved them satisfactorily. Then, the activists among the soldiers proposed, "The shortcomings of the cadres have been raised, and we ourselves should also rub each other's backs and wipe the stains clean." This was approved by the whole company, so the "Rubbing Backs Meeting" was held by platoon to review thoughts and wipe away each other's shortcomings. For example, if it is found that a comrade is not in high spirits, the platoon will automatically study the reason. If it is because they want to leave the team, they will discuss whether leaving the team is right or wrong and whether there is a way out. Soldier Cai Jintian wavered because his wife came to drag him back. The platoon immediately brought it up for review that night. After everyone's persuasion, he finally settled down. In this way, problems in the platoon were quickly discovered and quickly resolved, achieving close unity throughout the company. There have been no reductions in personnel in the past four months, and the combat effectiveness has also been rapidly improved. On the 4th of this month, the company participated in the battle of Xiangshuikou. Soldier Tian Wancai of the Third Platoon bravely charged and captured three enemies and seized five guns by himself.

　　华中开展政攻瓦解蒋伪七千
    【新华社华中二十七日电】华中军民针对蒋伪厌战思归情绪展开群众性的政治争取工作，收效极大。苏北各地近四个月来，瓦解蒋伪达五千余名，苏中仅据南通东台等十县，四、五两月统计，即有土著蒋伪二千三百余人回家自新。蒋伪逃亡数字亦逐月增加，如东台唐洋区二月份逃亡仅四人，三月十六人，四月竟达八十九人。南（通）、如（东）海（门）、启（东）开展“擦黑点运动”经验是：（一）打通干部与群众思想，纠正一般单纯仇恨心理，认识因为我们力量强大，以使彼等俯首来归。不是迁就，而是宽大。同时对坚决反动者还有镇压的一面。“擦黑点”不是消极的宽容而是积极的改造。（二）宽大政策要通过群众成为群众自己的政策，是治病救人而非骗人落网。挽救一个失足者，即为地方减少一份祸害，削弱敌人一份力量，不会增加地方负担。（三）争取蒋伪军来归，事前一定要由群众讨论，分别是非轻重，具体对待。（四）与公安防奸工作配合，对坚决反动者，予以严厉打击，对觉悟来归者，加以关怀教育，使之立功抵过。苏北在开展这一运动时，采取了各种有效方式：（甲）“救死运动”：乡成立“救死委员会”，村成立“救死小组”，召开伪属会议，说明再不回家，势必替蒋介石送死，分别推派代表想法挽救。（乙）“劝归小组”：由本村长者或老太婆组成，到伪属家劝说，促其把亲属召回。（丙）“择路运动”：指出蒋伪面前有三条生路，一条死路；回家、上江南、暗中为人民做事都是生路。坚决反动是死路。选择典型示范，务使生死分明。（丁）一封信运动：政府、地方士绅及家属同时写信劝导，达到每一个“还乡团”员至少能收到一封信。（戊）设立“投诚招待所”或“欢迎站”，散发“投诚证”，注明到达某地即可领取路费回家。“还乡团”员回家后，进行个别或集体教育（如开办训练班等），促其为人民立功，转劝其他蒋伪分子回家。同时帮助其安家生产。
    【新华社华中二十八日电】转载蒋后的苏中人民解放军某部新兵第三连，抓紧思想教育，开展“擦背运动”，收效颇大。该连原为地方武装，今年三月始升为主力。起初新战士不习惯部队生活，部分干部亦有此种现象，全连百分之八十战士情绪低落。新任指导员乃首先发动战士对干部提意见，并予以圆满解决后，战士中的积极分子即提出“干部缺点提过了，我们自己也应该相互擦背，把污点擦个干净”。当获全连同意，于是以班为单位，举行擦背会，检讨思想，互相擦去缺点。如发现某同志情绪不高，班上就自动研究什么原因，如系想离队，就讨论离队应不应该，有无出路。战士蔡金田因老婆来拖腿发生动摇，当晚班内即提出来检讨，经过大家说服劝导，他终于安心下来。这样班内问题迅速发现，迅速解决，达到全连紧密团结，四个月来无一减员，战斗力亦很快提高。本月四日，该连参加向水口战斗，三班小战士田万才英勇冲锋，一人即俘敌三名，缴枪五支。
