　　Qixian Militia Harasses Chiang's Troops
    Launches Campaign to Protect Wheat and Distribute Land
    [Our Dispatch] After Chiang Kai-shek's stubborn 32nd and 66th Divisions occupied Qixian County, they dispatched numerous plainclothes agents and entire companies and battalions daily to actively engage in activities, looting the people's property, conducting deceptive propaganda, and extensively utilizing traitorous landlords to restore the puppet district, township, bao, and jia regimes. They prepared to seize large quantities of wheat grain through various means such as apportionment and looting. In order to urgently mobilize, strike at Chiang's troops' attempts to seize wheat, and fully defend the wheat harvest, we specifically convened a meeting of cadres from the guerrilla areas throughout the county on May 26th to discuss the work of protecting the wheat harvest. We reorganized and adjusted the armed forces of all militias and district cadre teams throughout the county, appropriately allocated cadre personnel, and immediately restored the county, district, and village-level command posts. Based on the needs of the struggle situation, the entire county was divided into eleven guerrilla groups (i.e., guerrilla bases and joint defense). In just eight or nine days, we launched a vigorous campaign to distribute land and protect wheat. First, we used sparrow warfare, sniper fire, and ambushes to strike at the enemy's harassing forces. According to eight days of statistics, we repelled enemy harassing forces of company strength or more eleven times. Landmine warfare also posed a significant threat to the enemy. For example, the militia of our First District buried a landmine near Zhiguanzhuang Village, where the enemy was stationed. This scared the enemy into grabbing the village chief and ordering him to conduct a widespread search for landmines outside the village, preventing them from actively engaging in activities. Currently, enemy forces below battalion strength dare not come out boldly, and plainclothes agents dare not venture more than three li away from the main force. We also launched four raids on enemy-occupied villages at night, each time frightening the enemy into panic, firing machine guns and artillery wildly outside the village, exhausting the enemy and consuming a lot of ammunition. Under the protection of the active activities of our militia guerrillas, the masses in the vast areas of the mountainside and plains have launched a campaign of rapid harvesting, threshing, drying, and storing. Based on the personal experiences of the masses, we proposed: "Chiang's bandit troops won't occupy for long; don't let them seize a single grain! Protect the wheat grain, the lifeline; don't be afraid of hunger and famine. If the May wheat is looted, in June you'll flee famine with empty stomachs. Men, women, young and old, move together; quickly harvest, thresh, and store!" This campaign is now vigorously underway. For example, the villages of Shipen and Penyao in the Fifth District, which previously had been consistently paralyzed by the enemy, unable to distinguish between friend and foe, have also joined the movement this time. The whole village, men and women, organized work exchange teams to rush to harvest wheat, and proposed to complete it within four days (by June 2nd), and thresh and store as they go. They quickly hid clothes and food that they had never hidden before outside. Closely combining this with the development of the movement, various places have made arrangements for the distribution of the wheat fields of traitorous landlords. Currently, various places are uniformly distributing the wheat fields of traitorous landlords to the poor masses, because this is the urgent demand of the masses in the new areas, so the broad masses have quickly and widely participated in this movement. For example, in Guowan Village in the Sixth District, a sixty-year-old woman named Grandma Yang (a new guerrilla area that we could not reach before the recovery) found our Deputy District Chief Cui with a crutch when the enemy was harassing near her village, requesting the distribution of the eight mu of wheat belonging to Yang Fu, the head of the hui-team, and the local tyrant landlord Gao Julu. She said: "Because these two bad eggs oppressed me too painfully in the past!" Currently, the statistics for the Sixth District alone show that more than 5,000 mu of wheat fields have been distributed to the masses, and the masses are currently rushing to harvest the distributed wheat fields.

　　淇县民兵困扰蒋军
    开展保麦分田运动
    【本报讯】蒋顽三十二师、六十六师进占淇城以后，每天要派许多便衣和整营整连的兵力，出来积极活动，抢劫群众财物，进行欺骗宣传，大量利用奸霸地主恢复伪区、乡、保、甲政权组织，准备用摊派抢劫等各种手段大量掠取麦粮，我们为了紧急动员起来，打击蒋顽抢麦企图，全力保卫麦收，特于五月二十六日，召开全县游击区干部会议，讨论了保卫麦收工作，整顿与调整了全县所有民兵和区干队的武装力量，适当的配备了干部人员，立即恢复了县区村三级指挥部，依据斗争形势的需要全县划分了十一个游击集团（即游击基点和联防）以后，在短短的八、九天内，即开展了轰轰烈烈的分田保麦运动。首先是用麻雀、冷枪、伏击战来打击敌人出扰兵力，据八天统计即把敌人一连以上的出扰兵力，击退十一次。地雷战对敌威胁也很大，如我一区民兵在敌住之关庄村边埋了一个地雷，吓的敌人抓住保长，叫到村外普遍搜查地雷，不敢出来积极活动。现在敌一营以下兵力不敢大胆出来，便衣也不敢离开主力走出三里以外，并在夜间深入敌住村袭扰四次，每次都吓的敌人慌乱不安，向村外乱打机枪、大炮，使敌疲惫不堪，消耗很多弹药。在我民兵游击队积极活动的掩护下，山边平地广大地区的群众已开展了快收快打快晒快藏的运动，根据群众的切身体会，我们提出“蒋贼军，占不长，不让抢走一粒粮；保住麦粮命根子，不怕挨饿受饥荒。五月麦子被抢光，六月逃荒饿肚肠，男女老少一齐动，快割快打快收藏。”这一运动现正猛烈开展。如五区的石盆、盆窑等村，从前一贯对敌麻痹，敌我不分，这次也卷入运动中，全村男女组织变工突击收麦，并提出在四天以内完成（六月二日止），而且随打随藏。把以前根本未有藏过的衣服粮食，也很快的藏到外面了。紧紧的结合这一运动的开展，各地都作了分配奸霸麦田的工作，现各地统将奸霸麦田分给贫苦群众，因为这是新区群众的迫切要求，所以广大群众都迅速广泛的参加了这一运动。如六区郭湾村一个六十余岁的杨老太太（新游击区，未收复前我达不到）正当敌人在她村附近出扰时，持着拐杖找见我崔副区长，要求分配会队头子杨富和恶霸地主高聚禄的八亩麦子。她说：“因为这两个坏蛋，从前压迫得我太伤心了！”现仅六区一个区的统计即分给群众五千余亩麦田，目下群众正在抢收分得的麦田。（淇县联合办公室）
