[This report from the Jinan Bureau on the 12th] In Ganji Town, Weixian County, middle and poor peasants are developing the spirit of class friendship to organize temporary mutual aid. Following the emergency planting of 2,000 mu, they have planted another 770 mu. The masses, after a major recollection of the disasters, have largely overcome their reliance on heaven and waiting for rain. The biggest difficulty in the emergency planting is that the poor peasants received their land too late, leaving much of it uncultivated, and they also lack plowing cattle. Although some poor people have jointly purchased cattle or helped with "cattle legs," some still do not have even "cattle legs." The middle peasants have mostly planted their land and do not need cattle. Therefore, in the drought prevention, preparedness, and emergency planting movement, the spirit of class friendship of "middle and poor peasants are one family, helping each other" has been developed. The agricultural association's groups are temporarily used as temporary mutual aid groups, and the manpower and animal power of the middle peasants are temporarily transferred to help the poor peasants plant their land, and labor will be repaid after weeding. The middle peasants have cleared their minds and are completely voluntary, and the poor peasants are even happier. During the emergency planting blitz, all people and animals were mobilized, children served as inspection teams, and only one or two people were left in the shops to watch the doors. Within five days, over 770 mu of millet, cotton, and beans were planted.

　　干集组织临时互助
    继续抢种七百余亩
    【本报冀南十二日电】威县干集镇中贫农发挥阶级友爱精神组织临时互助，继抢种两千亩后，又抢种七百七十亩，群众靠天等雨思想经灾荒大回忆，大部克服。抢种最大困难是贫农分地太晚，地多荒着，又缺耕牛，虽有一部分贫民伙买牛，帮“牛腿”，但仍有一分人连“牛腿”也没有。中农把地大都种上，牛用不着，于是在防旱备荒抢种运动中，发挥了“中贫农一家，互相帮助”的阶级友爱精神，暂以农会小组做临时互助组，中农的人力和畜力，暂移来帮助贫农点种耕地，以后锄苗还工。中农打通了思想，完全出于自愿，贫农更高兴。抢种大突击中，人畜全出动，小孩子当检查队，店铺里也只剩一二人看门，五天内点种谷、棉、豆达七顷七十多亩。
