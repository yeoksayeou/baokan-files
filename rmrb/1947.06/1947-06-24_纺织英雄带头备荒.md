　　Textile Hero Leads the Way in Famine Preparedness
　　[This paper's report from Licheng] Ren Chunqiao, the textile hero of Shangtaibei Village in the Second District, has been extremely motivated since returning to the village after attending the district's summary meeting for the 100-day textile achievement campaign. He often says, "It's not good if only I am good; it's good when everyone is good." He is wholeheartedly thinking about how to make everyone like him. On June 14th, he first consulted with heroes Ma Qiping, Zheng Songjiao, and others to organize a hero group, with specific divisions of labor and separate leadership, using the method of "chicken lays eggs, eggs hatch chickens," and "one becomes ten, ten becomes a hundred," to strive to have all 88 part-time workers and 25 people who are too young to weave in the village learn to weave by the end of the year. Qiping said, "Three people with one mind can turn the earth into gold. If you help me and I help you, we will have more energy the more we work." In the afternoon, each team also gathered the masses to discuss how they survived the famine in 1943, recognizing the importance of thrift from their memories. They put forward the slogan: "Carry vegetables when working in the fields, and put a little less rice in each meal." Now every household has made a thrift plan: no gifts for festivals, no visiting relatives after this summer, and no cakes sent during the wheat harvest. Instead of having noodles every three days, they will have them every five days. They will have a check-up every five days, a summary every ten days, and earnestly implement the plan to overcome the famine.

　　纺织英雄带头备荒
    【本报黎城讯】二区上台北村纺织英雄任春巧，自从在区上参加总结百日纺织立功大会返村后，劲头儿非常大。他经常说：“自己好不算好，大家好才算好。”心心谋谋想叫大家和他一样。六月十四日他首先和英雄马起平、郑松姣等商议组织英雄集团，具体分工分头领导，运用鸡下蛋、蛋孵鸡，一而十、十而百的办法将全村八十八个半把式及在年龄不会织的二十五个人争取到年底人人都学会织。起平说：“三人一条心，遍地是黄金。你帮我我帮你，这样咱去干，越干越有劲。”下午各队又召集各队群众访四三年灾荒是怎样过活，从回忆中认识了节约的重要。提出口号：“去地做活捎采菜，顿顿做饭少下一把米。”现在家家都订出节约计划，过节不送礼，今年夏后不走亲戚，割麦时半晌不送饼，三天一顿面改为五天一顿面。五天一检查，十天一总结，认真贯彻，战胜灾荒。
