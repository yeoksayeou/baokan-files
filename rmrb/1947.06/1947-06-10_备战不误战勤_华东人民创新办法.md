　　Preparing for War Does Not Delay War Support
    East China People Innovate Methods
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 7th】The people of Central Shandong have created excellent methods to prepare for war without delaying support for the front lines: (1) In the direction of the enemy's advance, support-the-front-line guerrilla teams are established at the district or village level. When the enemy comes, they fight as guerrillas; as soon as the People's Liberation Army arrives, they support the front lines. During the Menglianggu Campaign, the Chanshan District of Yinan organized all the village cadres in the district. When the enemy attacked, they laid landmines to strike the enemy. After the People's Liberation Army arrived in the district to fight, the explosives squads and militia immediately became guide teams, leading the troops to quickly occupy forward positions, and the village cadres immediately returned to their villages to work. For example, Suijiadian immediately set up a tea station, and Liugou Village immediately opened cellars and took out grain to cook for the troops. (2) In enemy-occupied areas, armed village governments are established at the village level, responsible for rushing to cultivate, preparing for war and combat, and supporting the front lines. (3) In guerrilla areas frequently visited by both the enemy and us, such as Huangzhuang District in Yiyuan, the armed village government is still operating three miles away from the enemy, and the relocated masses are organized into squads, with the squad leader maintaining close contact with the village government and notifying them of any events at any time. In addition, each household hides a mobile supply of grain, pots, pans, and furniture. Upon notification from the village government, village cadres will retrieve them when needed and hide them again after use. This method has proven effective.

　　备战不误战勤
    华东人民创新办法
    【新华社山东七日电】鲁中人民创造备战不误支援前线的好办法：（一）在敌前进方向，以区或村为单位，成立支援前线游击队。敌来时打游击，解放军一到就支援前线。孟良崮战役时，沂南长山区将全区村干部组织起来，敌人进攻时，埋地雷打击敌人；后解放军到该区作战，爆炸班及民兵立即变为向导队，带部队迅速占领前进阵地，各村干部马上回村办公。如随家店马上设立茶水站，柳沟村立刻扒开地窖，取出粮食，给部队作饭。（二）在敌人占领区，以村为单位成立武装村公所，负责抢耕，备战作战，支援前线等工作。（三）在敌我常去的游击区，如沂源黄庄区，武装村公所离敌三里路，仍坚持办公，把转移的群众编成班，由班长经常与村公所取得密切联系，有事随时通知。此外，各家都藏有一部机动粮食与锅碗家具，通知村公所，一日需用，即由村干部去取，用后仍掩藏起来。此办法收效良好。
