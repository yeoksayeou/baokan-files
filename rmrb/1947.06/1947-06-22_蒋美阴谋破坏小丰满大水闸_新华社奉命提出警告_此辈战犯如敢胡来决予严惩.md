Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 20th—The Northeastern people's public enemy, Chiang's army, on the verge of collapse and in its death throes, is attempting to repeat its Yellow River flooding trick by plotting to destroy the world-famous Xiaofengman Power Plant's dam, aiming to inflict endless disasters on the people of the fertile Songhua and Harbin plains. This plot was revealed in an Associated Press dispatch from Peiping on the 11th. The dispatch quoted Corden, the American chief engineer of the Chiang government's Water and Electricity Engineering Bureau, as saying: "The Xiaofengman dam is in a dangerous state. A major flood or minor earthquake could destroy the dam, causing the deaths of millions of people in Harbin, controlled by the Communist army, and Jilin, controlled by the Kuomintang army." Corden deliberately created a smokescreen to cover up the Chiang army's sabotage plot, claiming: "The Communist army's attempt to gain control of the dam has resulted in the suspension of the work of transporting cement by train to the area." The Xinhua News Agency reporter pointed out that Corden's sophistry cannot cover up the US-Chiang collaboration in this destructive conspiracy. Everyone knows that, regardless of the military situation, our army has always taken utmost care to protect such great construction projects that benefit the people. Even during our retreat last year, we preserved the Xiaofengman Power Station intact. However, during our three advances south of the Yangtze River this spring and the recent campaign to advance into Kaiyuan, the Chiang army repeatedly opened the Xiaofengman and Huer Su dams, attempting to use the floods of the Songhua River and the East Liao River to prevent our army from advancing. This clumsy trick was admitted by the Kuomintang news agency, the Central News Agency, in its broadcasts. Recently, according to reliable information obtained by reporters from the military, the Chiang army has dug large ditches outside Jilin City, attempting to use the Songhua River to create a water defense line and resist stubbornly. All of these are preludes to the Chiang army's desperate struggles, plotting to carry out insane destruction. This agency is instructed to warn: "If the traitors and pawns of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, under the instruction of their American masters, dare to recklessly disregard the interests of the nation and the safety of the people's lives and carry out any destruction of this important industrial construction, they will not only bear full responsibility for all serious consequences, but the people of Northeast China will also severely punish these war criminals."

　　蒋美阴谋破坏小丰满大水闸
    新华社奉命提出警告
    此辈战犯如敢胡来决予严惩
    【新华社陕北二十日电】东北人民公敌蒋军，于濒临崩溃、垂死挣扎之际，竟图承袭其黄河放水之故技，阴谋破坏举世闻名之小丰满发电所大水闸，谋使肥沃之松哈平原人民遭受无穷之灾殃。此项阴谋，已于美联社十一日北平电讯中加以透露。该电讯引述蒋政府水电工程局美籍总工程师考登之谈话称：“小丰满水闸已处于危险状态，大水灾或轻微地震均能破坏此处江闸，并使共军控制之哈尔滨与国民党军控制下之吉林百余万人民遭受死亡。”考登氏竟故意制造烟幕，为蒋军之破坏阴谋作掩饰称：“共军企图取得大水闸之控制权，结果使以火车运洋灰至该地之工作遂行停止。”新华社记者指出：考登氏此种诡辩对美蒋合作之破坏大阴谋，实不能起丝毫掩盖之作用。尽人皆知，我军无论在何种军事情况下，素对此种有益人民之伟大建设工程无不保护备至，即在去年我军撤退时，亦完好地将小丰满电站保留，而蒋军则于我在今春三下江南以及此次挺进开原之作战中，均曾多次开放小丰满及赫尔苏之水闸，企图借松花江以及东辽河之洪水，阻止我军前进。此种黔驴拙技，并均经国民党通讯机关中央社历次广播中自行供认。而最近据记者自军方获得之确实可靠情报，蒋军已将吉林城外修成大水沟，妄图引松花江水布成水阵，负隅顽抗。凡此均系蒋军于绝望挣扎之余，阴谋施行疯狂破坏之前奏。本社奉命警告：“如卖国贼蒋介石之爪牙在其美国主子之授意下，竟敢悍然不顾国家民族利益以及人民生命安全，对此一重要工业建设加以任何破坏，彼等不仅将负引起一切严重后果之全部责任，同时我东北人民亦即将对此辈战争罪犯予以严厉之处置。”
