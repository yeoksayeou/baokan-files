　　Implementing Land Investigation During Production in Tinghepu
    Thoroughly Struggle Against Landlords in the Intervals of Sowing
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] During the intervals of production and sowing, Tinghepu in Licheng investigated land reform. On the night of June 1st, a meeting of emancipated peasants was held to examine the situation of the masses' emancipation. It was discovered that the poor peasant Wang Naikui's family of four, including father, son, daughter-in-law, and mother, only had two rooms to live in, while the landlord Liu Kui still had eight good buildings, and Wang Shusheng still had twelve good houses. Some landlords were still eating white flour every day and living very well. The village cooperative and logistics work were still controlled by landlords, and some landlords were still spreading rumors and sabotage. For example, the daughter-in-law of the fourth Bao said: "Distributing the fruits will be troublesome in the future." Huang Ying said: "A newly rich household is not as good as a bankrupt rich man." From these facts, it can be seen that some basic masses have not been completely emancipated, and the holes have not been filled; while some landlords are still living a good life by relying on exploiting the blood and sweat of the masses, and some are still acting as cadres, spreading rumors and sabotage. After the investigation, it was proposed to continue the liquidation, thoroughly overthrow the landlords, and sweep away the feudal remnants. The next night, a struggle meeting was held to conduct liquidation, calculating three buildings, fifteen good houses, four cave dwellings, four mu of land, and some grain, clothing, and items. The rumor-mongering and sabotage were handed over to the public security team for handling. After the struggle, the enthusiasm of the masses for production and becoming rich was greatly enhanced, and they are now fully engaged in production. (@Tian)

　　停河铺生产中贯彻查田
    下种空隙斗透地主
    【本报黎城讯】黎城停河铺于生产下种空隙，检查土地改革。六月一日夜召开了翻身农民会，检查群众翻身情形，发现贫农王乃奎一家父子婆媳四口人，只有两间房住下不，而地主刘奎则还有好楼房八间，王树声还有好房十二间，有些地主还是每天一顿白面，生活很好。村合作社及后勤工作，仍被地主掌握，有些地主仍在造谣破坏。如四保媳妇说：“分上果实将来是麻烦。”黄英说：“新发户不如个破财主。”从这些事实中，看到有些基本群众还没翻透身，窟窿没填起来；而有些地主，还依靠剥削群众的血汗来过着很好的生活，有些还当着干部，造谣破坏。检查后，即提出继续清算，彻底斗倒地主扫清封建尾巴。第二天夜即召开了斗争大会，进行清算，算出楼房三间，好房十五间，窑四孔，地四亩，及粮食衣物一部，造谣破坏的交由治安组处理。斗争后群众生产致富情绪高涨，现正全力进行生产中。（＠田）
