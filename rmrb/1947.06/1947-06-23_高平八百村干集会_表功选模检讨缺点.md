(Our newspaper, Taiyue, 21st dispatch) Gao Ping's eight hundred "founding heroes" (village cadres) met to examine the relationship between cadres and the masses. Chen Fajiang and 20 other village cadres were awarded the glorious title of "Model Cadre." Everyone first commended their merits. Each cadre described his contributions to the opening of Gao Ping's work, land reform, joining the army, and participating in the war. For example, Dou Yougen of Ma Village, during the initial opening of work, was captured by the enemy's "bandit suppression team" and sentenced to death for seizing a gun from them. He escaped death, recovered, and continued to work actively. Jia Mingshun, chairman of the Su Village farmers' association, had his leg broken by special agents for actively leading the masses to turn over, and was still actively leading the masses to settle accounts with the treacherous despots. He was then detained by feudal forces. He was not discouraged, but instead, he carried out the struggle more actively. Wang Tianfa, the village chief of Xiyao Village, was not moved when the targets of struggle, Wang Hugen and Wang Tingqing, sent him gifts in an attempt to buy him off. He exposed them on the spot and organized the masses to struggle against them. Chen Fajiang, the village chief of Haozhuang Village, in addition to leading the struggle, also organized iron furnace production, earning 2,100 stone of millet in one year. The masses said, "The village chief's leadership of the iron furnace is good, earning two autumn harvests in a year." During the land redistribution, he took the lead in giving up four acres of land, influencing the cadres to give up more than 40 acres in total. Zhao Jifa, the village chief of Wangjiang Village, did not eat public grain for eight months and announced that he would never eat public grain again, saying, "I have already turned over and have food and clothing, so I should serve the masses. Why should I eat public grain?" The village chief of Shuangjing Village personally led a large cart to participate in the war, and no one deserted. Everyone's morale was very high. After commending their merits, the county party committee mobilized all the village cadres to conduct self-criticism. At the beginning of the examination, some cadres' thoughts were not clear. They only talked about others and not themselves, talked about the small and not the big, talked about the process and not the facts, talked about what people knew and not what people didn't know, talked about the distant and not the near, talked about work attitude and not the fruits gained. The reason was that they had six fears: First, fear of losing face; second, fear that the masses would know about the struggle; third, fear that superiors would look down on them and be punished; fourth, fear that bad elements would take advantage of the situation; fifth, fear that other cadres would complain; sixth, fear that their wives would quarrel when they returned fruit. After in-depth mobilization to solve these ideological problems, they all made profound self-criticisms. For example, Zhang Dongbao, the conscription village instructor, said: "When distributing the fruits, I always wanted to get an advantage. Once, when distributing cloth and silk, others sold the cloth they received for only five sheng of rice per foot, but I sold the silk I received for one dou of rice per foot. I also bought a fighting machine for 15 shi of rice and sold it to other villages for a profit of 10 shi of rice. I wore a wool coat without paying for it. I wanted to keep a bicycle that others wanted to sell, but in the end, only I could ride it in the village. When the district cadre gave me advice, I mobilized the masses to struggle against him. When the masses and militiamen didn't listen to me, I attacked them. Everyone in the village was afraid of me. I thought it would be easier to work like this, but in fact, this is being divorced from the masses." Ling Annan, the village chief of Beishiwu Village, said: "When fighting the landlord Yao Chengzhou, I didn't teach Nanshiwu to fight him because I was afraid that things would leave the village. This is sectarianism." After this examination, everyone realized that being undemocratic, engaging in sectarianism, corruption, and gaining too much fruit would all lead to being divorced from the masses. Therefore, they were determined to make contributions for the people, and then conducted merit evaluation and comparison, and democratically elected 21 model cadres, including Chen Fajian. The first seven were awarded banners such as "Serving the People and Making Contributions" and "Turning Over Heroes," and the remaining each received a silver medal for meritorious service. Finally, model cadre Wang Tianfa made his own plan to make contributions: First, guarantee that the laborers and militiamen will not desert when they join the army, and guarantee that the land of the participating militiamen and laborers will be weeded on time. Second, return the fruits of struggle that were gained through corruption and low prices as soon as possible, and mobilize the cadres to complete the return recently. Third, organize the masses to beat 30 jin of dried vegetables per person, mobilize the masses to save one or two liang of rice per day per person, and save one he of rice myself. Fourth, directly lead a model mutual aid group to achieve three parts of cultivation and one part surplus. Fifth, go wherever I am transferred, and guarantee that the work in the village will not be affected after the transfer. Tang An cadres also made a plan for the whole village to make contributions: First, the whole village will dig ten wells and carry water to irrigate 200 mu of land. Second, universally do five weedings for cotton and three weedings for autumn, and the land of the participating militiamen and laborers and their families should be weeded in advance. Third, cadres should personally participate in mutual aid groups, create five model mutual aid groups among the 19 mutual aid groups in the village, and return the fruits of corruption, excessive gains, and low-priced purchases by all cadres within ten days. Then each cadre made a preliminary plan to make contributions and challenged each other to compete.

　　高平八百村干集会
    表功选模检讨缺点
    【本报太岳二十一日电】高平八百“开国元勋”（村干部）集会检查干群关系，陈发江等二十一位村干部荣获“模范干部”光荣称号。大家首先进行表功，每个干部都叙述了他在开辟高平工作与土地改革、参军参战中的功劳。如马村窦有根开辟工作时，因缴获敌人“剿匪队”一支枪，被敌“政工团”抓去枪毙未死，逃出医好后依然积极工作。苏庄农会主席贾明顺因积极领导群众翻身，被特务打折一条腿，仍积极领导群众清算奸霸，又被封建势力扣起来，他还没有灰心，反更积极的进行斗争。西瑶村长王天法，当斗争对象王虎根、王廷庆给他送礼，企图收买他时，他不为所动，当场揭破并组织群众进行斗争；浩庄村长陈发江除领导斗争外，并组织铁炉生产，一年赚小米二千一百石，群众都说：“村长领导铁炉好，一年赚下两个秋”。填平补齐时，他首先让出土地四亩，影响各干部共让地四十余亩。王降村长赵集发八个月没吃公粮，并宣布以后永不吃公粮，他说：“自己已经翻身，有吃有穿的，应该给群众办事，为啥要吃公粮”，双井村长亲自带领大车去参战，没有一个开小差的，大家的情绪都很高。经过表功以后，县委又动员全体村干部进行自我检查。开始检查时，有个别干部思想没打通，只说别人不说自己，说小的不说大的，说过程不说事实，说人知道的，不说人不知道的，说远的不说近的，说工作态度不说多得果实，原因是思想上有六个怕：一、怕丢人，二、怕群众知道了斗争，三、怕上级看不起，受处分，四、怕坏分子钻空子，五、怕其他干部埋怨，六、怕退果实时老婆吵闹。经深入动员解决这些思想问题后，都做了深刻的自我检讨。如参军村指导员张东保说：“分果实时我总想讨便宜，有一次分布和绸缎，别人分了布每尺只卖五升米，我分下绸缎每尺就卖一斗米，又用十五石米贱买斗争出来的铁机，转手卖给别村赚米十石，穿了一身毛衣没有出钱。一辆自行车别人要卖我要留，结果留在村上只能我一个人骑。区干部给我提意见，我就发动群众斗争他，群众和民兵不听我的话，我就打击他，全村的人都怕我，我认为这样工作好做，其实这就是脱离群众”。北试午村长凌安南说：“在斗争地主姚成周时，我不教南试午斗他，怕东西出了村，这是宗派主义”。这样检讨后，大家都认识到不民主，闹宗派、贪污，多得果实等等都会脱离群众，因此下定决心要为民立功，随即进行评功比功，民主选出模范干部陈发江等二十一人，前七名奖给“为民立功”、“翻身英雄”等锦旗，其余每人奖给立功银质奖章一个。最后模范干部王天法订出自己的立功计划：一、保证民夫民兵参军时不开小差，保证参战民兵民夫土地按时锄过，二、多得贪污与贱买的斗争果实回去就退，并要动员各干部于最近起退完。三、组织群众每人打干菜卅斤，动员群众每日每人省一两米，自己省米一合。四、直接领导一个模范互助组，做到耕三余一。五、调往那里就去那里，保证调动后村上工作不受损失。唐安干部也订出全村立功计划：一、全村打十个井，并担水浇地二百亩。二、普遍做到棉锄五遍秋锄三遍，参战民兵民夫干烈属的地要提前锄完。三、干部都亲自参加互助组，全村十九个互助组中创造五个模范互助组，十天退完各干部贪污多得贱买果实，接着每个干部都订出立功初步计划，并互相提出挑战竞赛。
