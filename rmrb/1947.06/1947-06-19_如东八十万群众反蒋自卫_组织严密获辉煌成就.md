Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 15th. A reporter from the Central China Branch summarized the scale and achievements of the five-month anti-"encirclement and suppression" mass self-defense movement in Rudong County, Jiangsu Province (formerly Rugao County) after the departure of the Chiang Kai-shek forces, stating: Over the past five months, the 800,000 people of Rudong County have repeatedly fought bitterly against two regiments of the Kuomintang's 49th Division and hundreds of local Chiang Kai-shek puppets. Eighty percent of the masses were involved in the struggle, participating in more than ten types of combat organizations, such as groups for eliminating traitors, reconnaissance, capture, demolition, armed labor, bridge removal, anti-espionage, escape, and mutual aid. They also launched a widespread and sustained campaign to earn merit. In Jing'an, Tieguo, Yuannan, and Xuwu townships alone, more than 1,500 people earned merit, accounting for 6 percent of the total population, marking the overall scale of the movement. The masses' fighting skills were also extremely creative. When the enemy prepared for "encirclement and suppression," the masses first launched a harrow battle, with 100,000 people participating in digging rivers, building dams, destroying main roads, repairing countless small roads and active dams, and capturing bridges, so that villages were connected to villages and settlements were connected to settlements. Floating bridges had bridge removal groups, specifically responsible for management. After the troops and masses passed, the bridges were removed to hinder the enemy's advance. The masses established a tight intelligence network, with each village militia reconnaissance group deploying widely distributed "reconnaissance cells," many of whom were elderly women, children, and women. Escort groups and escape groups were also equipped with reconnaissance to focus on eliminating traitors. One township, for example, uncovered more than twenty Chiang Kai-shek secret self-defense units prepared by the masses themselves to instigate riots in coordination with the Kuomintang army. As soon as the enemy entered the village, the masses thoroughly emptied their houses and cleared the fields, collectively relocating in units of escape groups. Thanks to the reliance on the masses, the loss of cadres and public grain and grass was minimal despite the enemy's tight searches. The enemy tried to scare the people with large-scale burning and killing, but the people responded to the burning and killing with fearlessness, proposing: "Villages help each other, and households help each other." They pre-arranged housing materials, grain, grass, and furniture, and the affected masses received rapid relief. When the enemy was "stationed for suppression," they secretly built more than thirty "stationed for suppression" strongholds, but before they could gain a foothold, the militia and masses organized "mazes," cold shots from all sides, the sound of gongs from all sides, and the light of fire from all sides. Three thousand people were involved in the movement, and the enemy, frightened, could only sigh: "The people here are fierce and 'communized' too deeply."

　　如东八十万群众反蒋自卫
    组织严密获辉煌成就
    【新华社华中十五日电】苏中分社记者综述苏中蒋后如（皋）东县五个月反“清剿”群众自卫运动的规模与成就称：五个月来，如东县八十万人民与蒋军四十九师两个团及数百土著蒋伪反复苦斗，百分之八十群众卷入斗争，分别参加十余种战斗组织。如锄奸、侦察、捕捉、爆炸、武装伴工、抽桥、反奸、跑反、互助等组，并展开了广泛持续的立功运动。景安、铁果、袁南、徐兀四乡就有一千五百余人立功，占总人口百分之六，标志着运动的全面规模。群众斗争艺术也极有创造。当敌准备“清剿”时，群众先展开钉耙战，先后有十万群众参加打河、打坝、破大路，修无数小道、活坝、俘桥，使村村相连，庄庄相通，浮桥并有抽桥组，专门管理。待部队群众走过，即将桥抽去，阻滞敌人行进。群众建立严密情报网，各村民兵侦察组下分布广泛的“侦察细胞”，其中许多是老太太、小孩、妇女。伴工组、跑反组里也配备侦察，注意锄奸。某乡就由群众自己破获准备暴动策应蒋军的蒋记秘密自卫队二十余。敌一进村，群众就彻底空舍清野；以跑反组为单位，集体转移。由于有群众依靠，敌虽严密搜索，干部和公粮公草损失甚少。敌人想以大烧大杀来吓倒人民，但人民却以不怕烧杀来反烧杀，并提出：“村村互助，户户帮忙。”预先筹出房料粮草家具，被害群众得到迅速救济。敌“驻剿”时，曾密筑三十余“驻剿”据点，但立足未稳，民兵群众就组织“迷阵”，四面冷枪，四面锣声，四面火光，三万群众卷入运动，敌人胆寒之余也只有自叹：“此地民性强悍，‘匪化’太深了。”
