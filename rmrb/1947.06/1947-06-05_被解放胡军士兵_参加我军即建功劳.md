Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st – Soldiers forcibly conscripted and oppressed by Chiang Hu's army are, after liberation, transformed into lively and vigorous people's fighters. Liberated soldier Sun Jingshan participated in combat on the third day after his liberation, following his squad leader in the forefront of the charge, capturing five guns in a row. After handing the guns over to others, he and another soldier ran up a mountain and captured an 82mm artillery piece and a radio station. After the battle, his superiors credited him with a meritorious service. In the Sanlang Basin battle, liberated soldier Zhang Xinggui destroyed the enemy's fortified hilltop battalion headquarters with accurate shooting of seven hits out of eight shells, enabling the PLA soldiers to quickly seize a favorable position to annihilate the enemy. In the Huangpu battle, Li Bingcheng, a liberated soldier of the 6th Company of a certain unit, refused to leave the line of fire after being wounded, saying, "My gun-changing plan has not been completed. Wherever the squad leader charges, I will charge there." The squad leader kept him as a messenger, but as soon as it dawned, he followed the troops and charged again. He often explained the Eighth Route Army's policy on prisoners of war to newly liberated soldiers. He was recently promoted to squad leader at a soldiers' congress. The liberated soldiers all discussed, "The Eighth Route Army doesn't distinguish between new and old soldiers, as long as you have the ability. We must study hard." Machine gunner Sun Shifa disregarded the enemy's flanking fire during the Shashi battle when covering the troops' charge, suppressing the enemy's firepower with machine gun fire. Later, when the machine gun malfunctioned, he quickly disassembled, repaired, and fired again, suppressing the enemies who had just advanced. During the Sanlang Basin battle, Fang Mingding, a liberated soldier of a certain unit, rushed to the front and shouted to the enemy, "Brothers, surrender quickly! The Eighth Route Army does not kill prisoners, and those who lay down their weapons will be treated even better. I came from the 31st Brigade. Look, I haven't even changed my clothes yet!" After his shout, many Hu Jun soldiers immediately laid down their weapons. In the Panlong victory, many liberated soldiers performed meritorious service and were elected as combat heroes. Six liberated soldiers from a certain unit submitted applications to the Communist Party branch of the company, requesting to join the Party and fight to the end for the revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd – The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region's Reception Center for Liberated Officers and Soldiers recently bid farewell to forty-four liberated officers and soldiers returning to their hometowns. After two months of personal experience, they were deeply moved by the close unity between the Communist Party, the Liberation Army, and the people, as well as the lenient treatment they received. They expressed their intention to make a new start after returning to their hometowns. Cheng Yaohuang, the former commander of the 405th Regiment of the 135th Brigade, was also invited to participate in the farewell meeting. He said sadly, "I was blindly deceived in the past, and I am extremely sad. It is my great fortune to be able to study in the liberated areas today. I have been examining myself for a month." He personally witnessed these brothers, who shared the same fate as himself, returning home, and sighed, "The Communist Party is truly a bright and upright major party!"

　　被解放胡军士兵
    参加我军即建功劳
    【新华社陕北一日电】被蒋胡军强拉压迫的士兵，一经解放后很多变成生龙活虎的人民战士。解放兵孙景山解放后，第三天即参加战斗，跟着班长在最前面冲锋，一连缴了五支枪。他把枪交给别人，又和另一战士跑到山上缴了一门八二炮，一部电台。战斗结束，上级给他记了一功。三狼盆战斗中，解放兵张兴贵以八炮七中之准确射击，摧毁了敌固守山头之营指挥部，使解放军战士迅速夺取了歼敌有利阵地。某部六连解放兵李柄成在黄铺战斗中，负伤后不下火线，他说：“我的换枪计划没有完成，班长冲到那里我也要冲到那里。”班长留他当通讯员，天一明他又跟着部队冲上去了。他经常给新解放兵解释八路军的俘虏政策，最近军人大会上被提拔为班长。解放兵都纷纷议论：“八路军不分新老，只要有本事就行。咱们也要好好学习。”机枪射手孙世发沙石战斗中掩护部队冲锋时不顾敌人的侧击，以机枪扫射，压制了敌人的火力。后来机枪发生故障，他很快的拆开修好又打，使刚走上来的敌人又被压下。三狼盆战斗时，某部解放兵房明丁，冲到最前面向敌人喊道：“弟兄们快缴枪，八路军不杀俘虏，放下武器更优待。我就是三十一旅过来的，你们看我的衣服还没有换。”经他这一喊，好多胡军立即放下武器。此次蟠龙大捷，很多解放兵立了功当选为战斗英雄。某部有六位解放兵向共产党连队支部呈送申请书，要求入党，要为革命奋斗到底。
    【新华社西北三日电】陕甘宁边区解放官兵招待处，日前欢送四十四个被解放官兵返乡。他们经过两个月来的亲身体验，对共产党解放军与人民的亲密团结，以及对他们的宽大待遇深为感动。表示返乡后重新作人。前一三五旅四○五团团长成耀煌亦被邀参加欢送会。他沉痛的说：“过去盲目受骗，万分难过。今天能在解放区学习，是我的大福气。一个月来我正在检讨自己。”他亲见这些和自己同一命运的弟兄们重返家园，感叹的说：“共产党真是个光明磊落的大政党！”
