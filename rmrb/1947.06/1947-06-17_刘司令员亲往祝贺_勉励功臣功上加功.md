　　Commander Liu Personally Congratulates,
    Encourages Meritorious Servants to Add Merit Upon Merit
    Ke Gang
    [Report from the Yubei Front, June 15th] Our reporter Ke Gang reports: General Liu Bocheng rushed to attend the opening ceremony of the battlefield heroes' conference of the 32nd Unit on the morning of the 8th. When General Liu stepped onto the rostrum, the entire audience stood in solemn silence, music filled the air, and the heroes shouted in unison: "Wishing Commander Liu good health." General Liu first paid tribute to the people's heroes and delivered a short congratulatory speech, saying: "Comrades, in this small corner, I have seen a group of the emperor's excellent children. This demonstrates the glorious victory of the people's cause and the bright prospects of a new democratic China. I feel infinitely gratified." Then, in his emotional tone, he said: "I have lived a few more days than everyone else. I know that in the past era of autocratic demons, the term 'meritorious servant' also existed, but the 'meritorious servants' they spoke of were only executioners who slaughtered and persecuted the people, which is completely incomparable to the people's meritorious servants of our people's era today. Our meritorious servants serve the people sincerely. Chairman Mao tells us that in the liberated areas, whether they are labor heroes or enemy-killing heroes, they are all products of the new social system, and they have three extremely great functions: first, leading the masses and promoting work, they are models in work; second, they are outstanding activists in various positions and are reserve forces for cadres at all levels; third, they are bridges connecting the leadership and the masses. From this, we can know how respectable the meritorious comrades are." Then he said very excitedly: "We are the people's meritorious servants. Whatever the people want us to do, we must do. Currently, we are on the eve of a major counter-offensive. The people hope that we will do the following three things bigger and better: first, carry out the people's self-defense war more heroically, annihilate more enemies, end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war dictatorship as soon as possible, and liberate the people of the whole country from under the iron hooves of the US-Chiang clique; second, thoroughly carry out land reform and completely crush the thousands of years of feudal shackles on the peasants' necks; third, carry out production better. Only in this way can the military and civilians have no worries about food and clothing. Of course, we are an army, and our main task is still fighting, which requires our meritorious comrades to strive to summarize and carry forward their good experiences, lead apprentices, cultivate more people's meritorious servants, and come up with more ways to annihilate a large number of enemies and welcome the upcoming major counter-offensive. Whoever can do these well will have more credit." Finally, he earnestly exhorted everyone: "Be sure to remember that meritorious servants must not be arrogant; be sure to lead the masses and humbly learn from the masses. I hope that at the next meeting, you can all add merit upon merit, and countless new meritorious servants will appear."
    [Report from the Yubei Front, June 15th] After General Liu Bocheng's speech at the First Frontline Meritorious Servants Conference of the 32nd Unit, more than 200 people's meritorious servants held meetings to discuss it. Ren Xiaoxiang, a combat hero of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment, said: "After listening to Commander Liu's report, I must lead the soldiers well, unite well, and practice good skills so that everyone can gain merit." Ren Laibao, a reconnaissance hero of a certain regiment, said: "A meritorious servant is to serve the people. In the future, we must think of more ways in our work, improve our skills, and thoroughly complete our tasks, so that there will be fewer casualties and more victories. Regarding land reform, we must help the masses at any time. At the same time, we must not violate the masses' discipline." Zhou Maoxiang, an outstanding enemy-killing hero and machine gun shooter, excitedly narrated his feelings about attending the meeting: "When I was in the Kuomintang army in the past, the officials never cared for the soldiers. Now I am in the People's Liberation Army and I am gaining merit for the people. The leaders care for us so much, sending us by horses and picking us up by cars. I am so grateful." Then he swore to do the following things in future battles: first, we must fight the enemy more bravely, and propose to the meritorious comrades of the brother units to see who wins more battles and who obeys orders best. Second, ensure that one to two meritorious servants are cultivated at the next meritorious service conference. Third, I am determined to learn two new characters every day from now on. Chen Jinxiang, a liberated soldier who gained merit in a certain regiment, said: "I was a sinner of the people when I was in the Chiang army in the past. Now I am a meritorious servant of the people in the People's Liberation Army. The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have made me a better person. In the future, I must make great contributions to the people."

　　刘司令员亲往祝贺
    勉励功臣功上加功
    柯岗
    【本报豫北前线十五日电】本报记者柯岗报导：刘伯承将军于八日晨赶来参加三二部队战地功臣大会启幕典礼，当刘将军步上主席台时，全场肃立，乐声洋溢，功臣齐呼：“祝刘司令员健康。”刘将军首向人民功臣致敬，并致简短贺词称：“同志们，在这小小角落里，我看到了一群皇帝的优秀孩子们，这表现了人民事业的光辉胜利，新民主主义中国清朗的远景，我感到无限欣慰。”继即以其富有情感的语调说：“我比大家多活了几天，我知道在过去专制魔王的时代，“功臣”这个名词也是有的，但他们所说的“功臣”，只有屠杀与迫害人民的刽子手，与我们今天人民时代人民的功臣是全然不能同日而语的。我们的功臣是诚心诚意给人民服务的。毛主席告诉我们，在解放区不管是劳动英雄或杀敌英雄，这都是新社会制度的产物，他们有着三种极其伟大的作用：一、带领群众，推动工作，他们是工作中的模范；二、他们是各个岗位上的优秀积极分子，是各级干部的预备队；三、是领导和群众结合的桥梁。由此我们可以知道功臣同志们是多么值得尊敬的人物了。”接着他又十分激动的说：“我们是人民的功臣，人民要我们做什么，我们就要做什么。目前我们处在大反攻的前夜，人民希望我们把以下三件事情做的更大、更好：第一是更英勇的进行人民自卫战争，歼灭更多敌人，早日结束蒋介石卖国内战的独裁统治，把全国人民从美蒋铁蹄下解放出来；第二是彻底进行土地改革，把农民脖子上数千年的封建枷锁完全粉碎；第三是更好的进行生产。只有这样，军民才能衣食无虑。当然，我们是军队，我们的主要任务还是打仗，这就要求我们的功臣同志们要努力总结并发扬自己的良好经验，带领徒弟，培养更多的人民功臣，想出更多的办法，歼灭大量敌人，迎接即将到来的大反攻。谁能作好这些，谁就有更多的功劳。”最后他诚恳的叮嘱着大家：“一定要记好，功臣是千万不能骄傲的；定要带领群众，并虚心向群众学习。我希望在下次开会时，你们都能功上加功，并有无数的新功臣出现。”
    【本报豫北前线十五日电】刘伯承将军在三二部队前线第一届功臣大会上讲话后，二百余人民功臣纷纷开会讨论。某团三连战斗英雄任笑祥同志说：“听了刘司令的报告，回去一定要把战士们带领好，团结好，练好技术，使大家都能立功。”某团侦察英雄任来保同志说：“功臣就是为人民服务，今后在工作上要多想办法，提高技术，彻底完成任务，使战斗伤亡少胜利大。对于土地改革，我们要随时帮助群众。同时不违犯群众纪律。”出色的杀敌英雄和机枪射手周茂祥同志兴奋感慨叙述他的与会感想：“我过去在国民党军队时，当官的从来没有爱护士兵，现在我在人民解放军里为人民立功，首长们这样爱护我们，用马送，汽车接，心里太感激啦。”接着他宣誓在今后战斗中要作到以下几件事：一、我们要更勇敢的打击敌人，并向兄弟部队功臣同志提出看谁打得胜仗多，看谁服从命令最好。二、保证在下次贺功大会时培养出一个至两个功臣。三、今后决心每天学两个生字。某团立功的解放战士陈金祥说：“我过去在蒋军时是人民的罪人，现在在人民解放军是人民的功臣，共产党人民解放军把我变好了，今后一定更要为人民立大功。”
