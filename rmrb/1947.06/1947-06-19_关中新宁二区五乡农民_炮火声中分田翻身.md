Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th—Amidst the sound of cannon fire, the peasant struggle to turn over and distribute land in the five townships of the Xinning Second District in the Guanzhong Sub-region has victoriously concluded, with 2,900 mu of land returning to the hands of the peasants. During the period of the Jiang-Hu army's offensive, the township militia, carrying guns and standing guard, monitored the enemy and protected the peasants, persevering in holding land distribution meetings, writing and issuing land deeds, guaranteeing the smooth progress of the struggle. When the land reform was initially carried out in the township, because the cadres only adopted simple methods of land donation, without mobilizing the masses to struggle, the peasants did not obtain enough land, and fifteen extremely poor households did not receive any land at all. The landlords, taking advantage of the land donation, withdrew an average of more than eleven mu of good land per person, and secretly harbored thoughts of a change in regime, falsely reporting land and not handing over old account books and contracts, causing the peasants to not obtain the benefits they deserved in the land reform. At the beginning of last month, the Guanzhong Sub-region Party and government organs sent twenty-one cadres to the countryside to mobilize the masses and carry out land reform. Since the struggle against landlord Zhao Mengxian in Jihe Village, calculating that he had overcharged rent of more than ninety-seven shi of grain, which was converted into land and returned to the peasants, the peasants in the township saw the realistic benefits of the struggle, and their enthusiasm greatly increased. Song Baiyou, a landlord in Songjia Village, lied that the old contract was lost, and the peasants immediately dug out the contract jar from his house and burned it on the spot, and elected a contract-writing committee, and the landlord established a contract with the peasants. After the liquidation struggle, 2,900 mu of land, 173 cave dwellings, 11 shi of fine grain, 10 head of cattle, and 1 mule were reasonably distributed to the peasants. The cleaning committee democratically elected was specifically responsible for measuring land and setting boundary stones. In order to take care of single men and demobilized soldiers, each of them was given one and a half people's worth of land, and the township also retained 98 mu of public land in preparation for resettling future demobilized soldiers and displaced people. After this struggle, each poor peasant obtained an average of 9.6 mu of land. Moreover, the quantity and quality of land were roughly equal, and the township's tenant farmers and extreme poor have now disappeared.

　　关中新宁二区五乡农民
    炮火声中分田翻身
    【新华社西北十五日电】炮火声中，关中分区新宁二区五乡，农民翻身斗争已胜利结束，二千九百亩土地重归农民手中。在蒋胡军进攻期间，该乡民兵背枪放哨，监视敌人掩护农民，坚持召开分地会，写发土地执照，保证了斗争的顺利进行。该乡初次进行土地改革时，由于干部仅采取简单的献地办法，没有发动群众斗争，因此农民没有得到足够土地，并有十五户赤贫户根本没有分到土地。而地主却乘献地时，每人平均抽回好地十一亩多，并暗怀变天思想，虚报土地，不交出陈账老约，致使农民在土地改革中没有得到应得利益。上月初，关中分区党政机关派了二十一名干部下乡发动群众，进行土地改革。自集合村斗争地主赵孟贤，算出长缴租子九十七石余，折成土地退还农民后，该乡农民看到了现实的斗争利益，情绪大大提高。宋家庄地主宋百有，谎说老约遗失，农民即从其家中挖出约罐子当场烧掉，并选出写约委员，地主给农民立约。在清算斗争后，二千九百亩土地，一百七十三孔窑，十一石细粮，牛十头及一匹骡子，合理分给农民。由民主选出的清理委员，专门负责丈地立界石。为照顾单身汉及退伍军人，特给他们每人分一个半人的地，全乡还留公地九十八亩准备安置以后的退伍军人和移难民。这次斗争后，平均每个贫农得地九亩六分。且土地数量质量大体平均，该乡佃农赤贫现已告绝迹。
