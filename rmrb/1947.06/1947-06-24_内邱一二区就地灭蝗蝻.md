　　Neiqiu First and Second Districts Eradicate Locust Nymphs On the Spot
    [Reported by this newspaper] Locust nymphs have been discovered successively in Hecun in the Second District of Neiqiu and Xiguan in the First District. In Hecun, one patch in the west of the village, five mu in size, has devoured three mu of millet seedlings belonging to the public security personnel. A patch measuring over seventy paces long and thirty paces wide has also been discovered north of the village. In Xiguan, a patch in the west of the village is one mu in size. Hecun has organized over two hundred people to capture and beat them, and most have been eliminated. Xiguan has achieved immediate elimination upon discovery. The county leadership has called on all areas to pay attention, conduct inspections everywhere during production, and eliminate them wherever they are found to avoid causing a locust plague.
