　　Serious Grain Shortage in Anyang
　　Chiang Kai-shek's Troops Loot Merchants and Civilians
　　[Report from the North Henan Front, 15th of this month] According to merchants and civilians who escaped from Anyang city, a severe grain shortage has occurred within Anyang, with Chiang Kai-shek's troops and the city's merchants and civilians抢粮搶糧 (qiang liang qiang liang--fighting over grain). Apart from a small amount of flour and large pancakes airdropped by Chiang Kai-shek's planes, the 40th Division of Chiang's army "donates" grain from merchants and civilians every day, and the landlords and larger shops have had their stored grain looted. The remnants of the Wang Ziquan bandits, Guo Qing, and the "Returning Home Corps," who reside in the four outer districts, are not entitled to the airdropped food and rely entirely on looting food locally for survival. The merchants and civilians in the city are in dire straits due to the looting by Chiang's troops, with dozens dying of starvation or committing suicide every day. The merchants and civilians in the city cannot bear being robbed and starved to death by Chiang's army. Whenever Chiang's planes drop flour and large pancakes, they all rush to grab them. One day, Chiang's planes dropped ten thousand catties of large pancakes, and the merchants and civilians抢去搶去 (qiang qu qiang qu --grabbed away) six or seven thousand catties. The 40th Division of Chiang's army even dispatched vehicles to suppress them, shooting more than a dozen merchants and civilians on the spot. Furthermore, the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the city have recently been demolishing civilian houses on a large scale, conscripting laborers, and rushing to build fortifications. Many civilian houses in the city and the surrounding villages have been demolished. In the northern district alone, two-thirds of the civilian houses have been demolished. The houses of forty-two families in Liujiazhuang, two miles northeast of the city, have all been demolished, and the refugees can only live in makeshift shacks. (Zhen Quan)
　　[Report from the North Henan Front, 15th of this month] On the morning of May 31st, hundreds of laborers escaped from the southern gate of Anyang, all looking emaciated and sick. They staggered as they walked, some still wearing cotton clothes. They were the ones who had been forcibly brought into the city by Chiang Kai-shek's troops to build fortifications. Initially, they had to feed themselves, but after their own money and belongings were used up, Chiang Kai-shek's troops only provided two meals of thin porridge a day. They had to dig ditches and build fortifications all day long, and anyone who slowed down was beaten with rifle butts or wooden sticks. At night, they were locked in rooms guarded by sentries. Moreover, Yan Shufang, Zhao Wenqing, and Liang Lanhua, villagers from Beigu Village in Neihuang, were seized by Chiang Kai-shek's troops while pushing carts of dates to Anyang a few days ago and forced to build fortifications. Now their belongings are all gone. They recently escaped from the city and, upon seeing the People's Liberation Army, felt like they had seen their own family. They诉蒋军暴行 (su jiang jun bao xing - denounced the atrocities of Chiang's army) to the People's Liberation Army and requested the People's Liberation Army to annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek's troops in the city as soon as possible.

　　安阳粮荒严重
    蒋伪抢掠商民
    【本报豫北前线十五日电】据安阳城逃出之商民谈，安阳城内已发生严重粮荒，蒋伪军与城关商民互相抢粮。蒋军第四十师除由蒋美机空运为数极少之面粉和大饼外，每日向商民“捐”粮，地主及较大商店之存粮已被抢空。住在四关之伪王自全匪、郭清残部及“还乡团”，无权享受空运之食品，全靠就地所抢之食粮糊口。城内商民，因蒋伪军抢粮已陷于绝境，饿死或自杀者每日数十人，城关商民不堪被蒋军抢劫与饿死，每逢蒋机丢下面粉和大饼就一齐去抢，某日蒋机丢下之万斤大饼被商民抢去六七千斤之多，蒋军四十师竟乘坐汽车出面镇压，当场枪毙十余商民。又城关蒋伪军近日大肆拆毁民房，征抓民夫，赶修工事，城关和城周许多小村庄的民房多被拆毁。仅北关即拆毁民房三分之二。城东北二里之刘家庄四十二户人家的房屋，全被拆光，难民只有搭起席棚居住。（振全）
    【本报豫北前线十五日电】五月三十一日晨从安阳南关逃出民夫数百，个个饿得面带菜色，病的不像人样，走起路来摇摇摆摆，有的还穿着棉衣，他们就是被蒋伪军抓进城内修工事的。开始是自吃自，自己钱物吃光后，蒋伪军每天只发两顿稀饭，整日挖沟盖工事，谁一慢了不是枪托，就是木棒。夜间被关在房里有哨兵看守。又内黄北固村村民阎书方、赵文青、梁兰华三人，于日前推枣到安阳，被蒋伪军抓住，强令修工事，至今财物全空，他们日前逃出城来，看到人民解放军后，像见到亲人，向人民解放军控诉蒋军暴行，要求人民解放军早日消灭该城蒋伪军。（振全）
