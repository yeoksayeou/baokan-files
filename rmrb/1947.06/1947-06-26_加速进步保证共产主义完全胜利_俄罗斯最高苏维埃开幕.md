　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Moscow Dispatch: Both Pravda and Izvestia published editorials on the 22nd discussing the leading role of the Russian Federation in the Soviet Union and the purpose of the Supreme Soviet session. Izvestia stated: "The purpose of the Supreme Soviet session of the Russian Federation, which opens today, is to accelerate the progress of the Russian Federation, guarantee new victories, and achieve new economic and cultural successes." Pravda believes that the Russian people play a leading role in the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated: This position was clearly demonstrated during the war. In peacetime, in the struggle to fulfill and exceed the post-war five-year plan, the Russian people have fully maintained it. By the end of the 1950 five-year plan, the Russian Federation will produce 63 percent of the country's steel output, 56.7 percent of coal output, 91.4 percent of automobile output, 87 percent of cotton fabric output, and almost two-thirds of the grain harvest. The great Russian people are leading the struggle to complete the new five-year plan and for the post-war progress of our Soviet state. The various nationalities of the Russian Federation, with all their economic strength, are assisting the restoration and economic development of other fraternal republics. Pravda concluded: The Russian people, uniting all the nationalities of the Soviet Union under the invincible banner of Lenin and Stalin, are victoriously advancing again and again in their peaceful construction work and in their struggle for the complete victory of communism in the country.
