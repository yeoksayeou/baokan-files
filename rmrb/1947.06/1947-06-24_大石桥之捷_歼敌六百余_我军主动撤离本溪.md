　　Victory at Dashiqiao
    Over 600 Enemies Annihilated
    Our Army Voluntarily Withdraws from Benxi
    [Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 22nd] The Liaonan Democratic Allied Army recovered Dashiqiao, an important railway junction on the China Changchun Railway, on the 16th. In the battle of Dashiqiao, the majority of the 25th Regiment of the Chiang bandit's Independent 9th Division was annihilated. A total of over 600 enemies were captured, and the following were seized: 4 mortars, 4 heavy machine guns, 10 light machine guns, 4 60mm mortars, over 400 rifles, 3 trucks, 10 signal flares, and over 200,000 catties of grain.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 22nd] After the Democratic Allied Army captured Benxi on the 13th on the An(dong)-Shen(yang) front, Du Yuming pieced together remnants of the 195th Division (two regiments), the 207th Division, the 2nd Division (one regiment each), and the 130th Division of the 53rd Army, which was transferred from Baoding, North China, to counterattack Benxi, attempting to save his dying fate in the Northeast. A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army engaged in mobile warfare north of Benxi, inflicting heavy casualties on the invading enemy, capturing over 100 enemy soldiers, and seizing 8 light machine guns. After completing the task of eliminating the enemy, in order to implement more agile mobile operations, it voluntarily withdrew from Benxi on the 19th. A frontline reporter commented: Our army's withdrawal from Benxi again this time will not affect the offensive operations currently beginning in Liaodong. Chiang and Du's army captured Benxi with the strength of two divisions and more, which not only cannot reverse its current decline, but on the contrary, makes it sink deeper into the quagmire, which is conducive to our army continuing to annihilate the enemy in large numbers.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong, 22nd] After the recovery of Andong City, order was quickly restored. Mayor Lü, who had been away from the city for more than seven months, returned to the city the day before yesterday, and the masses lined the streets to welcome him. Mayor Lü expressed his sincere condolences to the citizens who had been ravaged by the Chiang-Du army. At present, the city's electric lights and tap water have been restored, for the enjoyment of more than 250,000 citizens. The radio station has begun broadcasting. More than 30 primary schools have also resumed classes. The well-known light industry enterprises in Southern Manchuria, Andong Textile Factory and Liuhecheng Paper Mill, have successively started operations. District and street public offices have also resumed work. The masses have offered more than 400 firearms hidden by the Chiang army to the government. In recent days, the masses' struggle against bad elements and local bullies is actively brewing.

　　大石桥之捷
    歼敌六百余
    我军主动撤离本溪
    【新华社辽东二十二日电】辽南民主联军于十六日收复中长路重要铁路联结点，大石桥战斗中，将守敌蒋匪独九师二十五团大部歼灭。共俘敌六百余，缴获迫击炮四门，重机枪四挺，轻机枪十挺，六○炮四门，步枪四百余支，汽车三辆，火军头十个，粮食二十余万斤。
    【新华社辽东二十二日电】安（东）沈（阳）前线民主联军十三日攻克本溪后，杜聿明东拚西凑集合残部一九五师两个团、二○七师、二师各一个团及由华北保定方面调来之五十三军一三○师等师，向本溪反扑，企图挽救其在东北之垂死命运。民主联军某部，当在本溪以北进行运动战给进犯敌以重大杀伤，并俘敌百余，缴轻机枪八挺，于完成杀敌任务后，为更敏捷的实行机动作战，于十九日主动撤离本溪。前线记者评称：我军此次再度撤离本溪，对辽东目前正开始的攻势作战并无影响，蒋杜军以二师多兵力攻陷本溪，非但不能挽回其目前之颓势，相反使其更深的陷于泥坑，有利于我军继续大量歼灭敌人。
    【新华社辽东二十二日电】安东市收复后，秩序迅速恢复。离市七个多月的吕市长，已于前日返市，群众夹道欢迎，吕市长对于惨遭蒋杜军蹂躏的市民致以诚挚的慰问。现市内电灯、自来水已经修复，供二十五万余市民享用。广播电台已开始播音。三十余所小学亦已复课。南满著名轻工业安东纺织厂与六合成造纸厂均相继开工。各区街公所亦恢复办公。群众向政府献出蒋军匿藏之枪支已达四百余支。日来群众对坏蛋恶霸之斗争，正积极酝酿中。
