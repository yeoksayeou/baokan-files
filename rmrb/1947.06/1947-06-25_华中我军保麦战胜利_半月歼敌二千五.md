　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 23rd—Protecting the summer harvest was the main objective of the Suzhong and Subei campaigns in the first half of June against Chiang Kai-shek's forces. The local armed forces of Huaihai advanced into the Qingyi Lake wheat-producing area of Donghai County, known as the "Ukraine of Northern Jiangsu", recovering three strongholds including Machegou and dozens of villages, allowing farmers on both sides of the Shu River and Sha River to harvest their crops in peace. On the 14th, the local armed forces of the Second Sub-district of Suzhong completely annihilated a company of the training camp, reorganized from Xue Yue's special service regiment, and the Gaoyou Security Corps, killing and capturing over 260 Chiang's soldiers below the rank of deputy company commander, seizing 15 light and heavy machine guns, and recovering villages within a 50-li radius around Xiaoji and Fanchuan, setting an example for the local armed forces of the sub-district to eliminate a large number of Chiang's direct line main forces. In half a month, a total of 2,534 Chiang's and puppet troops were eliminated, 4 82mm mortars and 60mm guns were seized, along with 47 various light and heavy machine guns, 893 rifles and short guns, 120,820 rounds of ammunition, 8 war horses, and over 10 dan of Western medicine. Eighteen strongholds were recovered or once captured, including Xiangshuikou, a major town on the south bank of the Guannan River in northern Jiangsu, Daxingji, the intersection of the Tongyu and Lian (Shui) Xin (Anzhen) highways, and Guxi, a stronghold within the Jiangdu Xiaoji and Liangtai lines in central Jiangsu.
