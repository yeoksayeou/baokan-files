　　A Broken Cart Cannot Be Driven Anymore
    Critique of the Third Session of the Fourth National Political Council
    The Fourth "National Political Council," manufactured single-handedly by Chiang Kai-shek, dominated by reactionaries, and never participated in by Communists, tried its best to appear to echo the national democrats' call against civil war and for peace during this session. A very few people who sincerely hoped for peace but lacked experience once harbored illusions about this Political Council. Another group of constitutional monarchists, who did not agree with Chiang Kai-shek's monarchical autocracy but still hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would accept their constitutional monarchist ideas, also participated in this Political Council. But this Political Council, together with the Chiang Kai-shek government, is, as Bishop Yu Bin said in his opening speech, a broken cart. The reactionaries sitting in this broken cart are so impatient, so flustered, so confused and misguided that they cannot perform the play according to the planned script. The fake voice of peace had just been raised when a chorus of overly naive clamoring for "issuing a clear order to suppress," "quickly dispatching troops," and "using force to quell the rebellion" followed. It was as if Chiang Kai-shek's two hundred and some odd brigades on the civil war battlefield over the past year, due to the "secret order to suppress," only counted as "literary force" and "small soldiers," and had not "quelled the rebellion" but were merely sleeping. A person surnamed Yao said that he "stood on the people's standpoint in supporting peace, but stood on the factual side in opposing peace talks." A person surnamed Wu suggested that in the peace talks, "simultaneously take the order to suppress and ask the CCP whether or not they will lay down their arms? If they do not, then suppress them." A person surnamed Kong said, "I originally did not advocate peace, but now I cannot but advocate peace." His "peace" was "like treating a poisonous sore, it must be cut open with a knife to ensure life." A person surnamed Yan was even more honest: "Welcoming peace talks is welcoming the Communist Party," so he "cannot bear to speak of peace, nor is he willing to have peace talks; he is even more disgusted with peace talks." But these are only called "individual speeches," the highlight is yet to come. On May 31st, this Political Council passed a "Resolution on the National Defense Report," complaining that Chiang Kai-shek's civil war was not fought hard enough, the number of troops was insufficient, the quality was not high, the intelligence was inaccurate, the command was not good, the military expenditure was not much, and the local armed forces were not strong. Therefore, it solemnly proposed that the current "military importance is no less than during the Anti-Japanese War," therefore army reorganization should be army expansion, should "enrich existing troops, improve their quality, and strengthen their training"; therefore should "substantially increase military spending, improve treatment"; should "enrich local armed forces, train them, and replenish ammunition at any time, so as to be an assistant to the national army." On the same day, it passed a pile of more specific resolutions: "The situation of the Communist army's disturbance is increasingly pressing, please the government quickly send large armies to various routes to support"; "Quickly allocate a large amount of weapons and ammunition to the pacification zone, and subsidize supplies, and actively build local armed forces in the pacification zone, so as to cooperate with the national army to complete the pacification work as soon as possible"; "Quickly increase troops to strengthen the defenses of Rehe"; "Hebei suffers the deepest from banditry, and a large amount of funds should be allocated to enrich local armed forces"; "Restore Pingjin aviation to benefit military affairs"; "Quickly strengthen the pacification military forces in Shandong Province"; "Expand the Shandong provincial teams and issue weapons and ammunition"; "Quickly dispatch elite troops to rescue Anyang, which is under siege, to save the military situation in North China"; "Quickly send troops to suppress the Communist bandits in the Yellow River flooded area of Henan"; "Give priority to suppressing the bandits in northeastern Anhui, central Anhui, and the Hongze Lake border area"; "The public security in Henan and Jiangxi provinces is worrying, it is proposed to strengthen local military forces"; "The banditry in Guangdong Province is rampant, quickly send large armies to suppress"... Most of them require Chiang Kai-shek to "quickly and effectively handle" them, don't think that the passage of so many resolutions is perfunctory. The councilors, in their intense work, still carefully revised "prohibiting officers and soldiers from occupying civilian houses" to "prohibiting rear officers and soldiers from occupying civilian houses"; revised "banning irregular troops" to "reorganizing local troops"; and passed the "requesting the government to issue a clear order to stop conscription and levies" case, which had been reviewed and retained but still had objections, for the second time – that is, rejected it.
    People of the world, please see! This is the true face of the so-called National Political Council in Nanjing today. Is there any need for more explanation as to how fanatically this Political Council supports the civil war and how resolutely it opposes the people's peace movement? This Political Council is merely an organ that calls for war, and people absolutely cannot and should not appeal to it for peace, and absolutely cannot and should not believe in its so-called "peace appeals," is there any need for more explanation? Yet this murderous Political Council, this Political Council that opposes peace talks, hates peace talks, opposes stopping conscription and levies, demands the expansion of the regular army, the expansion of the local army, demands a substantial increase in military spending, and asks the government to "quickly increase troops to suppress the Communist bandits" on the entire line from Northeast to Hainan Island, also asks the government to "restate the policy of continuing to resolve the CCP issue through political means"; also asks the CCP councilors to "come to Beijing to attend the meeting to jointly plan national affairs"; also asks the CCP to "quickly send representatives to Beijing to unconditionally resume peace talks with the government"; also asks the presidium and resident committee of the council to "promote the realization of peace in the shortest possible time in the spirit of the resolutions of this conference." Two bowls of tofu are two bowls of tofu: the Political Council's spirit of the resolutions of this conference is to "ask the government to restate the political solution"; that is, the content of the resolutions of this conference is to ask the government to "quickly increase troops to suppress the Communist bandits." Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek can certainly restate it again, three times, four times, countless times.
    Honestly speaking, even if the Political Council issues ten thousand documents of "suppressing the Communist bandits," what other meaning does it have other than erecting its tail as a flagpole, so that the world can recognize its bloodline? Chiang Kai-shek does not need these heroic admonitions at all, Chiang Kai-shek has already done everything that can be done, and failed. The "peace" suggestions of the Political Council are also so contradictory and unbearable, simply a rotten nose tricking people. Then isn't this Political Council a waste of time? But it is not. On the afternoon of the 31st, after passing so many bloody and tragic cases, it immediately passed a small temporary motion: "Please the government quickly launch economic rehabilitation work, and quickly have the U.S. government earnestly discuss loans specifically for construction." What a great temporary motion, just now "military importance is no less than during the Anti-Japanese War," suddenly there is "economic rehabilitation work"; just now "suppressing" from Northeast to Hainan Island, everywhere requiring allocation of huge funds, weapons and ammunition, supplies, everywhere requiring a substantial increase in military spending, suddenly there is "specifically for construction." But under the pressure of domestic and foreign public opinion, what else can be said? In this way, this Political Council completed its two-in-one task: borrowing foreign debt, fighting the civil war. Everything in this Political Council is fake, only borrowing foreign debt and fighting the civil war are real.
    People cannot but notice that the Chinese people are urgently demanding real peace. However, this movement of the Chinese people has nothing in common with the reactionary Political Council. On the very first day of this Political Council meeting, May 20th, six thousand patriotic students in Nanjing formed a team to petition the Political Council, expressing their desire for food and peace, but were met with a city-wide military and police street battle, not allowing the petition. The councilors of this Political Council also slipped away, unwilling to accept the petition. After this day, students across the country launched a tragic, sacred, and great struggle against civil war, hunger, and atrocities; and aroused the widespread sympathy of professors, journalists, workers, and citizens. Students were beaten, arrested, and slaughtered, professors and journalists were arrested, newspapers were smashed and closed, and fascist terror enveloped the entire Chiang-controlled area. What did most of the councilors, who pretended to talk about peace, constitutional government, and construction, say about this? They said nothing, indicating that they had no conscience. When they sang the platitude of "peace talks," Chiang Kai-shek was quickly and effectively handling their decision to fight the civil war, and implementing "suppression" against the broad masses of people, represented by students, in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Qingdao, Kaifeng, Xi'an, Wuhan, Changsha, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places, opening up the second front of the civil war. How true is the touchstone of history! Those who support betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and civil war and those who oppose betrayal of the country, dictatorship, and civil war need to show their true colors to fight more and more every day. In this Political Council, a large group of councilors have already exposed that they are participating in the politics of selling the country, participating in the politics of dictatorship, and participating in the politics of civil war. And in the more intense struggle in the future, there will definitely be more people, faster and more thoroughly, exposing themselves.
    What new things did Chiang Kai-shek expose at this Political Council? In his speech on May 28th, he personally announced that the liberated areas, which account for one-third of the country's population, are "bandit areas"; although, it is said that he will continue to have "peace talks" with this "bandit area." He personally fabricated rumors that the students "stipulated June 2nd as the date for the general strike parade, in fact because June 2nd is the anniversary of the so-called anti-civil war movement launched in Yan'an last year." He also said: "The government had already learned of this plan." However, the people in Yan'an last year have not yet learned of this "anniversary." But most importantly, Chiang Kai-shek personally admitted that the majority of the people in the country have already judged right from wrong. He said: "I believe that the biggest hidden danger of the current country lies in the confusion of right and wrong concepts and the unclear understanding of interests, resulting in the loss of a common goal." The evidence is that "some social public opinions only place the responsibility for the war on the government, and oppose conscription and levies, without considering the cause of this kind of pain, who caused it, nor have they heard of the miserable life of the people in the bandit areas and made appeals." He said that the concept of right and wrong is "confused" because the confusion that once existed among the people has been clarified. Chiang Kai-shek's sewage once prevented people from recognizing the truth of things. But now the sewage has subsided, and when the water recedes, the stones are exposed, so what war responsibility, conscription and levies, "the miserable life of the people in the bandit areas," peace negotiations, the Political Council, the councilors, Chiang Kai-shek, the truth of everything and the truth of all the characters, are quickly exposed before the eyes of the people. The struggle of true faces is replacing the struggle of confusion and obscurity day by day. This is Chiang Kai-shek's greatest fear, and this is the greatest guarantee of the people's victory.
    On the basis of the widespread awakening of the broad masses of people, the Chiang Kai-shek government's political crisis, economic crisis, and military crisis are developing fiercely, and ninety brigades of Chiang Kai-shek's entire invading army have been cleanly annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, as Bishop Yu Bin described it, is not only a broken cart, but has already broken down. All reactionaries, centered on the CC Clique and the Revival Clique, united at this Political Council to help Chiang Kai-shek push the broken cart. But Chiang Kai-shek's fate of failure cannot be saved by them, nor can it be saved by anyone. The people are bound to win, and the people have the determination to achieve this victory without hesitation. And in the near future, this victory will be achieved. (June 5th)

### 破车不能再开  评第四届第三次国民参政会

　　破车不能再开
    评第四届第三次国民参政会
    蒋介石一手制造的，反动分子占绝大多数的，共产党人所从未参加的第四届“国民参政会”，在这次开会时，曾经竭力装作附和全国民主派反内战要和平的模样。也有极少数真心希望和平而缺少经验的人，曾经对这次参政会怀抱幻想。另有一部分君主立宪派，他们不赞成蒋介石的君主专制，但仍希望蒋介石接受他们的君主立宪论，这次也参加了参政会。但是这个参政会连同蒋介石政府在一起，按照于斌主教在开幕词中所说：是一辆破车。反动分子们坐在这辆破车中，是这样暴燥，这样慌张，这样昏迷失错，他们并不能按照预定计划把戏演好。和平的假嗓子刚刚拉开，“明令讨伐”呀，“速调大兵”呀，“武力戡乱”呀，一阵太过天真的喧哗却又随之而来。好似一年来内战战场上蒋介石的二百几十个旅，由于“密令讨伐”的关系，都只算“文力”和“小兵”，并未“戡乱”而只在睡觉一般。一个姓姚的说，他“站在人民立场上赞成和平，但站在事实方面则反对和谈”。一个姓吴的建议，在和谈中“同时把讨伐令带去，问中共放不放下武器？如不放下，则予讨伐”。一个姓孔的说，“我本不主张和平，但现在不能不主张和平”。原来他的“和平”是“比如治毒疮，必须开刀割去，始可确保生命”。一个姓燕的更诚实些：“欢迎和谈就是欢迎共党”，所以他“不忍言和平，亦不愿和谈；更讨厌和谈”。但是这些只叫做“个别发言”，精彩节目还在后面哩。五月三十一日，这个参政会通过了一个“对国防报告的决议”，埋着蒋介石的内战打得不够努力，军队数量不足，质量不高，情报不确，指挥不好，军费不多，地方武力不强。因此郑重提出：目前“军事重要不减抗战时期”，因此整军应该就是扩军，应该“就原有部队加以充实，提高其素质，加强其训练”；因此应该“切实增加军费，提高待遇”；应该“充实地方武力，加以训练，并随时补充弹药，俾为国军之助”。同日又通过了一堆更具体的决议：“共军扰乱情势日迫，请政府速派大军分路应援”；“迅时绥靖区拨发大量械弹，并补助给养，积极建树绥靖区地方武力。俾配合国及早日完成绥靖工作”；“速增派军队加强热河防务”；“河北匪患最深，应拨巨款充实地方武力”；“恢复平晋航空，以利军事”；“迅速加强鲁省绥靖军事力量”；“扩编山东省属团队，并拨发械弹”；“迅速派遣劲旅驰救安阳围城，以挽救华北军事大局”；“速派兵清剿河南黄泛区共匪”；“尽先清剿皖东北、皖中及洪泽湖边境股匪”；“豫赣两省治安堪虞，拟请加强地方兵力”；“粤省匪患猖獗，迅派大兵清剿”……其中大部分都要蒋介石“迅速确实办理”，不要以为这么多决议的通过是马虎的。参政员们在紧张的工作中，仍然细心地把提案中“禁止官兵占住民房”，修正为“禁止后方官兵占住民房”；把“取缔游杂部队”，修正为“整训地方部队”；并把已被审查保留而仍有异议的“请政府明令停止征兵征费”案第二次通过保留，——也就是否决。
    全世界人们请看吧！这就是今天南京所谓国民参政会的真面目。这个参政会是怎样狂热地拥护内战，怎样坚决地反对人民的和平运动，难道还需要更多的说明吗？这个参政会仅仅是一个呼吁战争的机关，人们绝对不能也不应向它呼吁和平，绝对不能也不应相信它的什么“和平呼吁”，难道还需要更多的说明吗？然而就是这个杀气腾腾的参政会，就是这个反对和谈，讨厌和谈，反对停止征兵征粮，要求扩大正规军，扩大地方军，要求切实增加军费，请政府从东北到海南岛全线都要“迅增大军清剿共匪”的参政会，又请政府“再度申明继续贯彻以政治方式解决中共问题之方针”；又请中共参政员“来京出席共策国是”；又请中共“速派代表来京与政府双方无条件恢复和谈”；又请该会主席团及驻会委员会“本此次大会决议之精神于最短期间促成和平之实现”。两碗豆腐就是豆腐两碗：参政会本此次大会决议之精神，“请政府再度申明政治解决”；就是本此次大会决议之内容，请政府“迅增大军清剿共匪”。因此，蒋介石当然可以再度、三度、四度、无数度地申明下去。
    老实说，参政会即使发出一万个“清剿共匪”的文件，但除了把自己的尾巴竖做旗杆，使天下人都认出它的血缘外，它还有什么一丝一毫的意义呢？蒋介石完全不需要这些英勇的忠告，凡是能做的蒋介石早已做过了，而且失败了。参政会的“和平”建议又是如此的矛盾不堪，简直是个烂鼻子坑人。那么这个参政会岂不是一场空？但又不然。在三十一日下午，通过了那么多血腥气的惨案以后，紧接着又通过了一个小小的临时动议：“请政府从速展开经济复员工作，并迅使美国政府切实磋商借款，专供建设之用”。好个临时动议，刚刚“军事重要不减抗战时期”，忽然又来了个“经济复员工作”；刚刚从东北“清剿”到海南岛，到处要拨巨款、拨械弹、拨给养，到处要切实增加军费，忽然又来个“专供建设之用”。但是在国内外舆论的压迫之下，另外还有什么话好说呢？就是这样，这次参政会就完成了自己的两位一体的任务：借外债，打内战。这次参政会一切都是假的，只有借外债、打内战两件是真的。
    人们不能不注意到，中国人民是在迫切要求真正的和平。不过中国人民的这种运动，与反动的参政会毫无共同之点。就在这次参政会开会的第一天，即五月二十日，南京六千爱国学生结队向参政会请愿，表示要饭吃、要和平，却被全城军警展开巷战，不许请愿。这个参政会的参政员们，亦溜之大吉，不愿接受请愿。这一天以后，全国学生展开了反内战、反饥饿、反暴行的悲壮神圣的伟大斗争；并且引起了教授、记者、工人和市民的普遍同情。学生们被殴打、被逮捕、被屠杀，教授和记者们被逮捕，报纸被捣毁和封闭，法西斯的恐怖笼罩着整个蒋管区。假装谈和平、谈宪政、谈建设的大多数参政员都对此有什么表示呢？他们什么表示也没有，表示他们什么心肝也没有。当他们唱着要“和谈”的滥调时，蒋介石正在迅速、切实办理他们的打内战的决定，向南京、上海、北平、天津、沈阳、青岛、开封、西安、武汉、长沙、重庆、成都、杭州、南昌、福州、广州、昆明、贵阳等地以学生为代表的广大人民群众实行“清剿”，开辟了内战的第二条战线。历史的试金石是何等真确呀！拥护卖国、独裁、内战的人和反对卖国、独裁、内战的人，一天比一天更需要拿出真面目来斗争。在这次参政会中，一大群参政员就已经暴露了他们是参卖国之政，参独裁之政，参内战之政。而在今后的更紧张的斗争中，一定会有更多人，更快、更彻底地暴露他们自己。
    蒋介石在这次参政会上暴露了什么新的事物呢？他在五月二十八日的演说中，亲自宣布：占全国人口三分之一的解放区是“匪区”；虽然，据说他还要与这个“匪区”继续“和谈”。他亲自造谣说，学生“规定六月二日为总罢课游行之日期，实因六月二日乃去年延安发动所谓反内战运动之纪念日。”还说：“政府早已获知此项计划。”而去年在延安的人，竟至今还未获知此项“纪念日”。但是最重要的，乃是蒋介石亲自承认全国大多数人民已经判明是非。他说：“余以为当前国家最大之隐函，在于是非观念之混淆，与利害认识之不明，以致丧失共同之目标”。证据就是“若干社会舆论只以战事责任加之政府，且反对征兵征粮，全不思此种痛苦之原因，系何方所造成，亦未闻土匪区民众水深火热之生活而作呼吁者。”他说是是非观念“混淆”了，正因为人民中曾经存在过的混淆已经澄清了。蒋介石的污水，曾经妨碍人民认识事物的真相。但是，现在污水下降了，水落则石出，于是什么战争责任呀，征兵征粮呀，“匪区民众水深火热”呀，和平谈判呀，参政会呀，参政员呀，蒋介石呀，一切事物的真相和一切人物的真相，就迅速暴露在人民的万目睽睽之前。真面目的斗争，一天比一天代替了混淆不明的斗争。这就是蒋介石的最大恐惧，这就是人民胜利的最大保证。
    在广大人民普遍觉悟的基础上，蒋介石政府的政治危机、经济危机和军事危机正在猛烈发展，蒋介石的全部进犯军中已有九十个旅被人民解放军干净歼灭，蒋介石的反动统治正如于斌主教所形容的，不但是一辆破车，并且已经抛锚了。以ＣＣ系、复兴系为中心的一切反动派在这次参政会上结合起来，要帮蒋介石推动破车。但是蒋介石失败的命运决非他们所能挽救，也决非任何人所能挽救。人民是一定要胜利，人民已经有了决心一往无前的实现这个胜利。而且在不远的将来，就会实现这个胜利。          （六月五日）
