Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 1st – The first phase of land reform in Jin Sui, which began in February, has recently concluded. The second phase is now underway, with the original work teams having moved to new areas; newly organized work teams are also eagerly setting off for the countryside. The main experiences from the first phase are as follows:

　　First, the work teams should take "land to the tillers" as the starting point of their work, resolving the land issue for all landless and land-poor peasants. They must not follow the old approach of "calculating accounts by problems," "public belonging to the public," and "private belonging to the private." As for the method of land distribution, a definitive solution has been reached, which is to divide the total land of the village by the total population to arrive at an average figure, and allocate or supplement land to landless and land-poor peasants according to this standard.

　　Second, the question of what peasants should receive in the land reform has been resolved. If peasants receive land but do not simultaneously receive the means of production such as food rations, draught cattle, seeds, farm tools, furniture, cotton, and even housing, they still cannot turn over. In some villages, the primary concern of landless and land-poor peasants was the issue of food rations. This work has proven that it is necessary to resolve the peasants' other various production conditions at the same time as resolving the land issue. Regarding the principles of distribution, there were fierce debates among the peasants in various places. Rich peasants advocated distribution based on population and labor power, which is a rich peasant line of distribution. Poor and hired peasants firmly advocated fair and reasonable average distribution based on population and degree of poverty, and the latter was adopted in all areas.

　　Third, the issue of transforming peasant associations in the land reform. The class consciousness of peasants has generally increased in the land reform. While demanding land and means of production, they also demand more complete democracy. In this movement, the policy of taking the rural proletariat and semi-proletariat (hired and poor peasants) as the backbone, firmly uniting with middle peasants, and uniting 90 percent of the masses in the countryside to manage their own political power and handle all their own affairs was implemented. Regarding organizational forms, poor peasant groups are established to reorganize peasant associations. The peasant association takes the poor peasant groups as the backbone, and everything goes through the peasant association, enhancing the prestige and rights of the peasant association. Furthermore, new blood is used to replenish the Party's grassroots organizations in the countryside.

　　Finally, throughout the entire work process, a mass line must be implemented like a red thread. Consult with the masses on everything, and let the masses handle everything. Comrades of the work teams must be determined to be pupils of the masses, trusting in the correctness of the masses. Do not rigidly apply formulas, but start from the specific conditions of the masses at the local level and at the time. Furthermore, be good at concentrating the opinions of the masses and transforming them into a compass to guide the masses' movement forward. Transform the masses' methods of investigating and solving problems into our methods of guiding the masses. In this way, we can achieve the unity of the leadership's policies and leadership backbone with the masses.

　　晋绥土地改革经验
    【新华社晋绥一日电】晋绥土地改革，新自二月份开始的第一期，已于日前结束。第二期正在开始，原有的工作团已转移新地区；新组织的工作团又踊跃首途下乡。第一期工作的主要经验为：
    一、工作团应以“土地归农”为工作出发点，解决全部无地少地农民的土地问题。决不能因袭过去“按问题算账”“公归公”“私归私”的老一套办法，至于分地办法，亦有了肯定的解决。即是以全村人口除全村土地，得出平均数，按此标准给与或补足无地少地农民。
    二、解决了土地改革中农民应得到些什么的问题。农民得到土地，如不同时得到口粮、耕牛、种籽、农具、家具，棉花直至房窑等生产条件，仍然不能翻身。有的村子的无地少地农民，首先提出的是口粮问题，此次工作证明：必须与解决土地问题同时解决农民的其他各种生产条件。关于分配原则，在各地农民中，都曾有激烈的争论。富裕农民主张按人口及劳动力分配，这是富农路线的分配方法，贫雇农则坚决主张：按人口和贫苦程度公平合理的平均分配，各地均采后者。
    三、土地改革中改造农会问题。农民在土地改革中阶级觉悟普遍提高，在要求土地及生产条件的同时，也要求更充分的民主。这次运动中，贯彻了以农村无产阶级、半无产阶级（雇、贫农）为骨干，坚决联合中农，团结农村中百分之九十的群众，自己动手管理自己的政权，办理自己的一切事情。关于组织形式，系建立贫农小组，整理农会。农会以贫农小组为骨干，一切经过农会，提高农会的威信及权利。更从而以新的血液，充实党在农村中的基层组织。
    最后在整个工作过程中，必须像一条红线似的贯彻着一条群众路线。有事和群众商量，一切通过群众，交给群众办理。工作团同志必须下决心当群众的小学生，信任群众的正确。不要硬套公式，须从当地，当时的群众具体条件出发。进而善于把群众的意见集中起来，转化为指导群众运动前进的指南针。把群众考察问题和解决问题的方法，转化为我们指导群众的方法。这样就能达到领导方针及领导骨干与群众的一致。
