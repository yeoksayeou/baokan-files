　　Armed Interference in Land Reform
    Wu Tingying Expelled from Military Service
    and Handed Over to the Government for Legal Punishment
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Jin-Cha-Ji Daily of the 22nd of last month: Wu Tingying, a cultural instructor of the 3rd Company of a certain regiment of the Ji-Jin military region, was expelled from military service for interfering with land reform. He is the son of Wu Shaowu, a notorious landlord and local tyrant of Wangzhuangbao. Before the incident, he was the "big flagpole" of the Nanshan area of Hunyuan, and no one dared to provoke him. After our army liberated Hunyuan City, Wu Shaowu, in order to escape the people's punishment, pretended to be enlightened and sent his son Wu Tingying to the 5th Brigade of the sub-district for training. Later, he became a cultural instructor in the 3rd Company of a certain regiment. From then on, Wu Tingying showed off his power as soon as he returned to the village, carrying a rifle and running rampant. The district and village cadres were so scared that they dared not meet him. Later, the regiment called him back, but he soon returned and shouted in the street: "If my land is not returned, I will perish together with these guys (referring to the district and village cadres)." Once, he ran into the district head on the street, pointed his gun at the district head's head and demanded that he return the land. Only after the masses agreed did he let the district head go. The district allocated him 170 jin of millet and 12 mu of land to take care of his life, and comforted him: "We are all revolutionary comrades, and we should sympathize with the masses' legitimate demands." He shouted: "Can the revolution revolutionize its own life!" and resolutely demanded the return of his belongings. Da Zakuang, a mass leader, was beaten half to death by his rifle butt, and he threatened to shoot the district head and village cadres, scaring most of the village cadres into running away. Once, when the district secretary went to the county for a meeting, Wu Tingying used a rifle to force him to answer: "Will you return it or not?" While they were arguing, he was captured by the headquarters. After interrogation, Wu Tingying was expelled from military service and handed over to the government for legal punishment.

　　武装干涉土地改革
    吴廷英被开除军籍
    并送政府依法处罪
    【本报讯】据上月二十二日晋察冀报称：冀晋×团三连文化教员吴廷英干涉土地改革被开除军籍。他是王庄堡有名的地主恶霸吴少武之子，事变前浑源南山的大旗杆，无人敢惹。我军解放浑源城后，吴少武为了逃避人民对他的惩罪，假装开明，就把他儿吴廷英送到分区五大队受训，后在×团三连任了文化教员，从此，吴廷英一回村即大显威风，扛着一枝大枪横行霸道，区村干部吓的都不敢见面，后来团里将他叫回，但不久又回来在街上大吆喊：“如果不把我的地退回来，我要和这些家伙们（指区村干部）同归于尽。”有一次在大街上碰见区长，枪口对准区长的头当下要他退地，群众允许他才将区长放了。区里为照顾他的生活，给他拨了一百七十斤小米、十二亩地，并安慰他：“咱们都是革命的同志，对群众这种正当要求应表同情。”他高叫：“革命还能革自己的命！”坚决要求退回东西。大杂框是群众领袖，被他的枪托打了个半死，并扬言枪毙区长和村干部，吓的村干部大部逃跑。一次区书到县开会，吴廷英以大枪逼问：“退还是不退？”正在吵嚷之际，即被司令部捕获，经审讯将吴廷英开除军籍，送交政府依法处罪。
