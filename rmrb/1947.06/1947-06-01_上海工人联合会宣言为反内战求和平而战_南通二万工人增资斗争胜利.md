　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th: According to TASS Shanghai: The Shanghai Trade Union Federation recently issued a manifesto, stating its attitude towards the movement to strive for peace in China. The manifesto pointed out: The current tragic situation in the country is caused by the civil war, and the Chinese people's persistent struggle for peace over the past twenty months has been ineffective. The manifesto said: The blood-drinking warmongers (Note: referring to Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist partners), after suffering military defeats, are now attempting to use peace talks as a pretext to gain breathing room in order to prepare for a larger war. The manifesto urged Shanghai workers to fight against the civil war, demand genuine and lasting peace, punish the warmongers, and establish democracy in accordance with the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. The manifesto also called on Shanghai workers to oppose conscription, requisitioning of grain, excessive issuance of currency, exorbitant taxes, and borrowing foreign debts to fight the civil war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 30th: Earlier this month, more than 20,000 textile workers in Tangzha and other places in Nantong City opposed the freezing of the cost of living index and held a seven-day strike. Even the factory police all joined the labor unrest and supported the strike. The factory was forced to increase wages from the original 494.7 billion to 1.5 trillion.
