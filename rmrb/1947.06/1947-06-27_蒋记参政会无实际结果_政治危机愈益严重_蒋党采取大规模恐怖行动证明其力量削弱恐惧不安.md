Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th: Moscow dispatch: The New Era Weekly's 25th issue published a lengthy essay by Chinese affairs expert Avarin, commenting on the recent session of Chiang Kai-shek's National Political Council. According to Avarin, this session failed to produce any practical results. The political crisis in the Chiang-controlled areas not only did not ease after the meeting, but instead became increasingly serious. The Kuomintang authorities are now in a state of unease, agitation, and fear. The large-scale terrorist actions they have taken prove that the reactionaries have been greatly weakened. Avarin said that the Chinese reactionaries may be able to prolong the civil war and the suffering of the people for some time with American aid, but they will not be able to strangle the people's movement or destroy the liberated areas.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 25th: Chiang Kai-shek has set up concentration camps in Huai'an, Lianshui, Funing and other cities in northern Jiangsu, where he abuses and murders democrats and patriotic youths. The concentration camps are managed by agents of the Military Statistics Bureau. The one in Huai'an is the largest, holding more than 500 people, most of whom are in shackles and handcuffs, disheveled and filthy, and subjected to all kinds of torture. The Lianshui concentration camp is located in a dark and damp house on East Street, surrounded by layers of Chiang's troops with live ammunition. When a new prisoner enters, Chiang's agents immediately dunk his head into a prepared urine bucket, calling it "eating dessert." Afterwards, he lies all day on a wet, smelly, tattered mat, with two daily meals of moldy black bean and wheat soup. At night, screams come from the concentration camp, as Chiang's agents use various cruel tortures to abuse the youth, such as pressing with levers, nailing fingers, and clamping chopsticks between fingers. In Funing, there are two "reformatories" and five concentration camps. In the past thirteen days, as many as fifty-four people have been shot, an average of four people per day. Nearby residents, when picking grass outside the West Weimen slaughterhouse, often find the dead with their feet exposed outside the soil, a gruesome sight.

　　蒋记参政会无实际结果
    政治危机愈益严重
    蒋党采取大规模恐怖行动证明其力量削弱恐惧不安
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】莫斯科讯：新时代周刊第二十五期刊载中国问题专家阿瓦林的长篇论文，评论蒋记国民参政会最近一届会议。按照阿氏的意见，这一届会议并未能产生任何实际结果，蒋管区的政治危机在会议后不仅丝毫没有缓和，相反却愈益严重。国民党当局现在是处在一种不安的激动和恐惧中，他们所采取的大规模恐怖行动，证明反动派已大大削弱了。阿氏说，中国反动派也许可能以美国援助把内战和人民的苦难再延长若干时间，但是它都绞杀不了人民运动，也摧毁不了解放区。
    【新华社华中二十五日电】蒋介石在苏北淮安、涟水、阜宁等城内遍设集中营，虐杀民主人士与爱国青年。集中营均由军统局特务管理，以淮安规模最大，被拘留者达五百人以上，大多脚镣手铐，蓬头垢面，受尽折磨。涟水集中营设于东街一所阴暗潮湿的屋内，四周由实弹蒋军层层警戒。新被捕者进去，蒋特即将他头浸到准备好的尿桶里，称为“吃点心”。以后终日躺在湿臭的破席上，一天两顿的霉味的黑豆麦汤。深夜，集中营里传出阵阵惨号，蒋特以压杠子、钉指甲、手指夹筷子等各种酷刑虐害青年。阜宁有“感化所”两座，集中营五所，最近十三天内，遭枪毙者即达五十四人，平均每天四人。附近居民，到西圩门外屠场拾草，常发现死者双脚露在土外，惨不忍睹。
