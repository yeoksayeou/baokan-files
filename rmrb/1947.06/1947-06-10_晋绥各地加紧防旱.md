Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 8th. Jin-Sui is launching a drought prevention and famine preparation movement. The spring drought area in the district is quite large, and the masses have a rather serious mentality of waiting for rain and relying on relief. To this end, the Jin-Sui Sub-bureau called on the Central Committee to make a special decision: Land reform work teams in various counties should immediately be dispatched to various districts to mobilize dry farming and dry planting, and to rush to plant pumpkins, beans, potatoes, and various drought-resistant crops. Cadres in various agencies are carrying out large-scale melon planting. Agencies affiliated with the Administrative Office have already planted more than 1,600 seedlings. Dai County is building water conservancy projects. More than 1,400 mu of paddy fields have been reclaimed along the Hutuo River, which can increase rice production by nearly 1,000 dan. The fifth district of the county has rushed to plant two-thirds of the 40,000 mu of farmland. The seedlings have emerged for 5,000 mu of sorghum. The masses in mountain villages are opening springs and digging wells to carry water and sow autumn crops. Mountain villages in Baode have organized surplus labor to reclaim mountains in Kelan to plant potatoes and beans. Each household plants at least one qing to five qing (each qing is three mu). Lucu Village in Hecheng is carrying out a "plant 100 pumpkin seedlings per person" campaign led by cadres using accounting methods. The village, with 590 people, has increased planting of more than 44,000 pumpkin seedlings.

　　晋绥各地加紧防旱
    【新华社晋绥八日电】晋绥展开防旱备荒运动。该区春旱地区颇广，而群众中等雨等救济思想又相当严重，为此，晋绥分局号召中特决定：各县土地改革工作团，立即分派到各区发动干耕、干种，抢种南瓜、豆类、洋芋以及各种耐旱作物。各机关干部正进行大量种瓜，行署所属机关已种一千六百苗以上。代县正兴修水利，滹沱河沿岸已垦出稻田一千四百余亩，可增产稻米近千石。该县五区川地四万亩耕地已抢种三分之二，有五千亩高粱已出苗，山地村庄群众则开泉凿井，担水播种秋季作物。保德山地村庄已组织剩余劳动力到岢岚垦山，种植洋芋和豆类。每户至少种一垧至五垧（每垧三亩）。河曲鹿固村以算账办法，干部带头开展每人种百苗南瓜运动。该村五百九十口人，已增种南瓜四万四千余苗。
