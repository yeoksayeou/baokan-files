　　Yongnian Commends Model Cadres
    [Our newspaper Yongnian dispatch] Yongnian held a county-wide cadre meeting on May 9th. In addition to summarizing the expansion of the army, model cadres were also commended. Comrade Wang Yuehua from the Fourth District worked day and night in the army expansion effort, creating the experience of a model village for conscription in a village with a weak and backward work foundation. Comrade Xu Shun from the Fifth District led all cadres in the district to work diligently in the army expansion, achieving the largest number and the best quality of recruits, making it a model district for army expansion in the county. Comrade Guo Huaizhen from the Second District worked actively in the area bordering the city, where the struggle against the enemy was intense, and also completed the army expansion task. After everyone's evaluation, twenty model cadres were selected and awarded a major merit. At the end of the meeting, Political Commissar Li called on all cadres in the county to continue to make contributions in their work. Those who have already made contributions should make even more, and those who have not should strive to make contributions. We must make contributions in all kinds of work. (Xiaoshan)

　　永年表扬模范干部
    【本报永年讯】永年于五月九日全县干部会上除总结扩军外，并对模范干部进行表扬。四区王月华同志在扩军工作中日夜奔忙，在工作基础薄弱落后的村创造了参军模范村的经验。五区徐顺同志在扩军中领导全区干部努力工作，扩军数量最多，质最好，为全县的扩军模范区。二区郭怀珍同志在城边对敌斗争紧张的地区积极工作，也完成了扩军任务。经过大家的评议，选出了二十名模范干部，并记大功一次，会议最后，李政委号召全县干部在工作中继续立功，已经立了功要功上加功，没立功的要争取立功，要在各种工作中立功。（萧山）
