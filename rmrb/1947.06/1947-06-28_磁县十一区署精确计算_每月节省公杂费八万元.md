　　Cixian Eleventh District Office Accurate Calculation
    Monthly Saving of 80,000 Yuan in Public Expenses
    [Our Newspaper Bo’ai News] The county government held a meeting of all office cadres and service personnel on the 13th of this month to discuss production and famine preparation. After a warm discussion, regarding production, large quantities of melons, vegetables, and eggplants are being planted. The seedlings of the pumpkins that have emerged already number over 500. Regarding conservation, in the first five months, each person saved an average of two liang of millet per day, totaling 348 jin and 10 liang, which has all been handed over to the public. Starting from June 15th, each person will save four liang of millet per day, reducing the amount of flour and eating more porridge. Each lamp will use three qian of oil per night, and waste paper will be used more. This has already begun to be implemented. The leadership also instructed cadres in each district to be with the masses, preparing for war and storing grain, urgently planting crops, preparing for famine, and advocating "a steady stream" to get through the famine.
    [Our Newspaper Cixian News] After the Eleventh District Office formulated a plan for production, conservation, and famine preparation, the results have been significant. The district office has a total of twelve or thirteen service personnel. Before the plan, there was significant waste. The kitchen burned 3,000 jin of charcoal per month, using a large fire, costing 63,000 yuan. Lamp oil and cooking oil consumption was 31 jin per month (at 500 yuan per jin), costing 15,750 yuan. Office expenses and miscellaneous expenses amounted to at least 40,000 yuan per month. The above three items totaled over 118,000 yuan. After formulating a "steady stream" conservation plan, the large kitchen fire was first replaced with a bellows fire, which now only burns one cart of charcoal per month, costing 23,000 yuan. Regarding oil consumption, no lamps are lit at night when not working, or if there are other matters, people combine and light one lamp together. Usually, no cooking oil is used, but a little can be used when improving living standards. In this way, only 11 jin of oil are needed per month, costing 5,600 yuan. Waste paper is used as much as possible for office expenses, and unnecessary miscellaneous expenses are completely stopped. In this way, about 10,000 yuan per month is needed. The above three items total 38,600 yuan, saving 80,000 yuan per month. Regarding meals, the previous practice of two meals of steamed rice in the morning and afternoon and porridge in the evening, with noodles every other day, has been changed to porridge in the morning and evening, steamed rice at noon, and noodles every four days.
    This conservation plan was implemented on the basis of improved ideological understanding among all personnel in the office. Currently, everyone not only pays attention but also makes time to grow vegetables to improve their living standards. Everyone is highly motivated. (Reporter: Ji Xiao, Zhi Fu)

　　磁县十一区署精确计算
    每月节省公杂费八万元
    【本报博爱讯】县府机关于本月十三日召开全机关干部杂务人员会议，讨论生产备荒。经过大家热烈的讨论，在生产方面，大量种瓜、菜、茄子，现在出苗的南瓜已有五百余苗。节约方面，前五月份每人每日节约小米二两，共三百四十八斤十两，已全部交公。自六月十五日起，每人每日节约小米四两，减少面多吃稀饭。办公灯油每盏灯每夜三钱油，纸张多用废纸，现已开始实行。领导上并指示各区干部必须与群众在一起，备战藏粮，抢种、备荒、提出细水长流，渡过灾荒。
    【本报磁县讯】第十一区公所订出生产节约备荒的计划后，效果很大。区署共有公杂人员十二、三人，在没有计划前浪费甚大，每月厨房烧炭三千斤，用的大吸火，需洋六万三千元，灯油和吃油每月得三十一斤。（每斤五百元）需洋一万五千七百五十元，办公费和杂支每月至少需洋四万元，以上三项共需洋十一万八千余元。在定出细水长流的节约计划后，首先将厨房的大吸火改为风匣火，每月才烧炭一车需洋两万三千元；用油方面，晚上不办公一律不点灯，或有其他事情合并一处伙点一盏灯，平常时不吃油，如改善生活时可少吃些，这样每月需油十一斤，需洋五万六千元，办公费尽量用废纸，杂支不必要者一律停支，这样每月有一万元，就差不多了。以上三项总共洋为三万八千六百余元，每月可节省洋八万元。在吃饭方面由早、午两顿闷米饭，晚上稀饭，隔两天一顿面，现在改为早晚稀饭，午间是闷饭，四天一顿面。
    这一节约计划是在全署人员思想打通基础上进行的，目前大家不仅注意，而且抽空种菜改善生活，大家劲头很高。（记孝、治富）
