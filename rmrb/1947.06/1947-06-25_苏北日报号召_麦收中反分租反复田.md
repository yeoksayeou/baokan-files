　　*SuBei Daily* Calls for
    Opposition to Re-renting and Land Reclamation During Wheat Harvest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 21st] The *SuBei Daily* recently published an editorial stating: As the new wheat comes to market, the feudal landlords who collaborated with the enemy will certainly take the opportunity to threaten farmers who have obtained land, carrying out re-renting and land reclamation, and even retroactively calculating last year's autumn rent. Moreover, in central areas where feudal forces have not been thoroughly defeated, and in areas affected by enemy disturbances, similar events may also occur. Therefore, during this year's wheat harvest, we must not forget to carry out the struggle against feudal forces in opposition to re-renting and land reclamation. Through this struggle, we will further develop a mass-based armed movement against Chiang Kai-shek. Regarding methods for carrying out the struggle, the editorial proposes: 1. Strengthen education for poor peasants and farm laborers who have obtained land regarding protecting their land and grain, treating seizing and concealing harvests and opposing re-renting and land reclamation as two equal aspects of the struggle. 2. For landlords and local bullies who have forcibly imposed re-renting, mobilize the masses to resolutely struggle, forcing them to return land contracts and grain, and imposing appropriate sanctions. 3. Governments and armed forces in marginal areas should provide strong support to the masses, resolutely打击 (dǎ jī - strike, crack down on) the feudal forces who rely on enemy power to forcibly impose re-renting and land reclamation, punishing one as a warning to a hundred.

　　苏北日报号召
    麦收中反分租反复田
    【新华社华中二十一日电】此间苏北日报顷发表社论称：新麦登场，投敌的封建地主，一定乘机威胁得田农民，进行分租复田，甚至倒算去年秋租。而中心区封建势力未彻底打垮，及受到敌情波动地区，也可能发生同类事件。因此，今年麦收中绝不能忘却向封建势力进行反分租、反复田斗争。通过这一斗争，进一步开展群众性的武装抗蒋运动。对开展斗争的办法，社论提出：一、加强对得田贫雇农的保田保粮教育，把抢收掩藏和反分租反复田作为两个同样的斗争内容。二、对已强迫分租的地主恶霸，发动群众坚决斗争，迫令其退出田契粮食，予以适当制裁。三、边缘地区政府和武装均应给群众以有力的支持，对依仗敌势强行分租复田的封建势力坚决打击，惩一警百。
