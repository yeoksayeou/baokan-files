　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyue, 8th. The wheat harvest struggle in Jiyuan County is nearing its end, and the Seventh District, where the Du Eight Joint Unit is located, has successfully concluded. Since the third crushing of the enemy's grain looting offensive last month, the Du Eight Joint Unit militia have taken advantage of the victory to advance four li, occupying the Dàqiáo (Big Bridge) position one li away from the enemy stronghold at Pōtóu (Slope Head), using stone mines to blockade the Pōtóu enemy stronghold, and the masses worked day and night to rush the harvest. Special-class hero Lǐ Chuányù led the militia to both rotate for battle and help with threshing. The rotational battle teams of the First and Fourth Districts also helped the masses harvest 53 mu in frequent battles, averaging one battle per day. The Qí Jìnwù mutual aid team of Mǎzhù Village completed 100 mu in nine days, including both cutting and threshing. The Du Eight Joint Unit not only finished harvesting and hiding the grain, but also used stone mines to seal the grain hiding caves and cut and hide the wheat stalks. Six villages including Mǎzhù organized more than 700 primary school students to carry out a wheat gleaning campaign, picking up every last wheat ear in the fields. The Zhāng Nàifēn sisters gleaned one shi of wheat, equivalent to the income from two mu of wheat. After ten days of struggle, the Seventh District had completely finished harvesting and hiding all grain by June 2nd. In order to summarize experience in a timely manner, the leadership held a meeting of wheat protection heroes in Liúzhuāng, five li away from the enemy, on the 2nd, and selected 20 meritorious personnel for protecting wheat, including Xuē Pínghuá, Lǐ Chuányù, Zhāng Zuòyù, and Zhāng Bǎoxǐ, and summarized the following experiences: (1) Overcoming the idea of underestimating the enemy, emphasizing unified leadership, and giving full play to a high degree of organizational strength, organizing everything that could be organized. (2) Adopting an active offensive in tactics and fully mobilizing to strike the enemy. (3) During the wheat harvest, land reform was launched in Zuǒshān and Mǎdòng, one li away from the enemy's fort, and dozens of poor peasant households were emancipated, obtaining 270 mu of land, and organizing a command post and self-defense force, no longer supporting the enemy, and strengthening the border positions. (4) All cadres participated in the rotational battle teams, playing a leading role. (5) Models were elected and commended in each section, which enhanced everyone's enthusiasm for making contributions.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyue, 8th. The summer harvest in Wángwū has reached its most intense stage, with 150,000 mu of wheat expected to be completely harvested by the 10th of this month. In Lǐjiāshān on the bank of the Yellow River, all eleven households in the village formed four groups: an armed group of six people, a wheat cutting group of three people, a wheat bundling group of three people, and a wheat carrying group of four people, who guarded while harvesting, and completed the harvest of all 150 mu of wheat in three days. Generally, all villages have achieved "three days to clear the ground", and are now striving for "five days to clear the threshing ground". More than ten villages in the hinterland First District organized a peasant expedition team of more than 150 people to help villages along the river cut more than 1,000 mu of wheat. Comrade Wú Diàn, a district cadre, helped the masses cut wheat in Báixī River, and was so tired that he could not straighten his back, but still did not rest. The rotational battle teams and militia in the border areas, "with a gun in one hand and a sickle in the other," formed two armed wheat cutting teams and launched a wheat cutting competition. The first team helped Dīngjiāzhuāng Village harvest more than 80 mu of wheat in one day on the 27th.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 8th. The victory of the Jinnan People's Liberation Army on the outskirts of Línfén protected the wheat harvest of the masses along the Fén River. Fénchéng, Xiānglíng, and Hóngdòng are important wheat producing areas in southern Shanxi. Although rainfall was scarce this spring, the soil is fertile, and the yield per mu is still more than three dàdǒu (big dipper, each dipper is 26 jin/ 13 kg), and some wheat fields can be irrigated with canals, resulting in even higher yields. Harvesting has now begun in various places, and men, women, old, and young are working in the fields all day long. When the People's Liberation Army passed through a golden field, attacking the Chiang Kai-shek and Yán Xishan troops, people could be heard everywhere greeting the soldiers: "Now that you've come, we can harvest the wheat with peace of mind." Before fleeing with his tail between his legs on the 30th of last month, the Yán Xishan puppet county magistrate of Fénchéng had personally sent a letter to the Yán Xishan puppet 13th Special Office in Xiānglíng, "urging the dispatch of a large army to harvest the wheat." But less than an hour after his letter was sent, he fled in a panic.

　　三次击破蒋伪抢掠进攻
    杜八联胜利完成收麦
    【本报太岳八日电】济源全县麦收斗争已入尾声，杜八联所在的七区已胜利结束。该区自上月第三次粉碎敌人抢粮进攻后，杜八联民兵即乘胜向前推进四里，进占距坡头一里之大桥阵地，以雷封锁坡头敌据点，群众连明彻夜抢收。特等英雄李传玉领导民兵一面轮战，一面帮助打场。一、四区轮战队亦在平均每日一仗的频繁战斗中，帮助群众抢收五十三亩。马住村齐进兀的互助组九天内，连割带打完成了一百亩。杜八联不仅打完藏完，并用石雷把藏粮洞都封锁好，麦秆也都切断藏起来。马住等六个村，还组织了六个村七百余小学生展开拾麦运动，连地里一颗麦穗都拾得干干净净。张耐芬姐妹拾麦一石，顶二亩麦的收入。经过十天斗争，七区至六月二日已全部打完、藏完。领导上为及时总结经验，并于二日在距敌五里之留庄召开保卫麦收英雄会议，选出薛平华、李传玉、张作玉、张保喜等二十名保麦功臣，并总结出以下经验：（一）打破轻敌思想，强调一元化领导，发挥高度的组织力量，把一切可能组织起来的都组织起来。（二）战术上采用积极进攻，全动打击敌人。（三）麦收中突击了距敌堡一里的左山、马洞土地改革，数十户贫苦群众翻了身，得到二百七十亩地，组织了指挥部，自卫队，不再维持敌人，加强了边沿阵地。（四）全体干部参加轮战队，起了带头作用。（五）每个段落选举表扬模范，提高了大家立功情绪。
    【本报太岳八日电】王屋夏收已至最紧张阶段，十五万亩小麦，预计可于本月十号全部登场。黄河边的李家山，全庄十一户组成四组：武装组六人，割麦组三人，捆麦组三人，担麦组四人，一面掩护，一面收割，三天即将一百五十亩麦全部收完。各村一般都做到了“三天地光”，现正争取“五天场光”。腹地一区十余村组织百五十余人的农民远征队，帮助沿河村庄割麦千余亩。区干部吴殿同志在白西河帮助群众割麦，累的腰都伸不起来，还是不休息。边沿区轮战队、民兵“一手拿枪、一手拿镰”，组成两个武装割麦队，展开割麦大竞赛。第一队二十七日一天帮助丁家庄称村收麦八十余亩。
    【新华社晋绥八日电】晋南解放军在临汾外围的胜利，保卫了汾河沿岸群众的麦收。汾城、襄陵、洪洞一带，为晋南重要产麦区。今春虽雨量缺少，但地质肥沃，每亩产量仍在三大斗（每斗二十六斤）以上，部分麦田能利用水渠灌溉，产量更多。各地现已开始收获，男女老少整日在田间劳作。当解放军穿过一片金黄色的田野，进击蒋阎军时，随处可听到群众向战士的招呼：“你们来了，麦子可安心收起了。”汾城阎顽县长在上月三十日弃头逃窜前，尚亲自函请襄陵阎顽十三专署“速派大军前来收麦”。但他的信发出不到一小时，就狼狈逃跑了。
