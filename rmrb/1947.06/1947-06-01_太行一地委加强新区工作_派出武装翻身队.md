　　Taihang First Prefectural Committee Strengthens Work in New District
　　Sends Armed Turn-Over Teams
　　[This newspaper's Taihang dispatch] In order to carry out anti-traitor revenge and realize "land to the tiller" in the new district, the First Prefectural Committee transferred experienced village cadres from the turn-over movement in six counties – Shahe, Xingtai, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Gaoyi, and Zanhuang – to form armed turn-over teams and rush to the northern front to carry out the turn-over movement. During the discussion, everyone proposed: Our own turn-over is not yet thorough. Although we have land and houses, some landlords are still not convinced. Helping the poor brothers in the new district to turn over is also for our own sake. Only in this way can we defeat Chiang Kai-shek, and then we can be considered to have completely turned over. Speaking of this, everyone was extremely emotional. These 130 new forces are heading to the three counties of Yuanshi, Jingxing, and Huolu.

　　太行一地委加强新区工作
    派出武装翻身队
    【本报太行讯】为开展新区反奸复仇，实现耕者有其田，一地委抽调沙、邢、内、临、高、赞六县翻身运动中有经验的村干部，组成武装翻身队，驰赴北线开展翻身运动。在讨论时大家提出：我们的身还没翻透，虽有了房地，但有些地主还不服气，帮助新区穷兄弟翻身，也是为了自己，只有这样才能打败蒋介石，咱才算彻底翻身。说到这里，大家情绪极高，这一百三十个生力军前往元（氏）井（陉）获（鹿）三县。
