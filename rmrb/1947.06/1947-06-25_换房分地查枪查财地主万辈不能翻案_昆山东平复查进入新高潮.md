　　Exchange Houses, Distribute Land, Investigate Guns and Wealth, Landlords Will Never Be Allowed to Overturn Verdicts
    Kunshan and Dongping Re-examination Enters a New Climax
    [Our Newspaper Jiluyu Twenty-third Dispatch] Kunshan and Dongping have launched a revolutionary competition, and the re-examination movement involving hundreds of thousands of peasants has reached a new climax. At the activist conference in Kunshan County on May 30, the guerrilla warfare and the movement to distribute land and investigate wealth over the past two months were summarized, heroic models were rewarded, and the experience of land reform in the heartland north of the Yellow River was introduced by the prefectural committee. The enthusiasm of the cadres was unprecedentedly high, and they immediately launched a land reform competition against Dongping, proposing six conditions: eliminate landlords, distribute all floating wealth, exchange all houses, not struggle against a single middle peasant, leave no blank villages, organize 80 percent of the masses, and female and male militia accounting for 3 percent of the total population. After the conference, the Third District immediately held a village cadre meeting overnight, and the next day the whole county was greatly mobilized. Under the slogan of everyone, young and old, male and female, starting together in the First District, every household was engaged in intense action. The women members of Dai Miao took the lead in investigating floating wealth, and wrote letters to the district every night about the progress of their work. The wartime intelligence station became a communication network for land reform. The work situation and experience of each village were reported to the district that night, and the district compiled these experiences and immediately passed them on to the villages. In five days, the preliminary investigation of wealth in the entire district was completed. At the farmers' conference in the entire district, an evil landlord who resisted the investigation of wealth was executed, and the issue of further deepening the re-examination was discussed. The First District also challenged the Third District. Huangheyai, Zhang Wenyuan, Liu Tang and other villages in the Third District, which were known as backward villages, also found the floating wealth of 19 landlords in one day. Zhang Wenyuan village alone found more than 100 packages and a large number of wooden utensils, 13 bombs, and 115 bullets. Huangheyai found two large guns and a large amount of gold, silver and jewelry in the home of the pseudo-official Wang Jikai. The Fourth District held a treasure competition with the floating wealth that had been investigated, and male and female peasants visited it endlessly. The Second, Ninth, and Fifth Districts are close to the enemy's strongholds. Xiaopikou fought guerrillas during the day and carried out land reform at night. First, the floating wealth of the "Returning Home Corps" was investigated and distributed to the masses that night. It is estimated that in less than ten days, the situation in the whole county has been broken open, and 180,000 peasants have been completely involved in this movement. In Dongping, more than half of the peasants had initially obtained results in May. At present, the great emancipation and re-examination movement of 400,000 people in the whole county is about to be fully launched, and in a fighting posture, it has responded to the Kunshan challenge competition and decided to eliminate the landlords within a month. In terms of leadership style, we must be bold and let go, and hand over power to the peasants, so that the movement can truly deepen and improve a step further.
