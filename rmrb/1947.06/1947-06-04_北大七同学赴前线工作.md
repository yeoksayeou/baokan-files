　　Seven Peking University Students Go to the Front Lines
    [This newspaper] Chen Zhen, a student from the first group of the Peking University College of Arts and Education to work on the front lines, returned to the university and mentioned that there were still not enough cultural workers at the front. After hearing this, Peking University students scrambled to sign up to go. The university then decided to send Qin Tianlang, Cao Yong, and five other people from the College of Arts and Education and the Literature and Art Research Office to work on the front lines first. On the evening of May 29, students from various colleges held a farewell party, and the College of Arts and Education performed Peking opera to add to the fun. The seven students departed on the morning of May 30.
