　　Boost Morale and Prepare for the Counter-offensive: Grand Celebration of Meritorious Service for the Huai River Troops

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Huai River Brigade's First Battalion, one of the main assault forces in the Tangyin City battle, has seen over 500 comrades recognized for meritorious service since the Jishui-Tangyin campaign. Various levels of units have successively congratulated them. To further promote the meritorious service movement, a battalion-wide celebration meeting was held on May 27th, lasting three days. The first day was a forum for meritorious units, attended by representatives from 22 meritorious units, including: the Third Detachment of the First Company, which broke through Tangyin City; the Third Squad of the First Company, which defended the Tangyin City moat for a full day and night; the Machine Gun Platoon of the Second Detachment of the Second Company, which contributed to construction; the Fourth Squad of the Third Company, which broke through the Zhangzhuang front line; and the Fifth Squad directly under the command, a model of discipline, etc. The second day was a forum for heroes. On that day, each hero's unit prepared horses to greet them, and the battalion leaders personally led units directly under their command to welcome them from afar, with gongs and drums resounding and the streets filled with spectators, a truly magnificent scene. After the opening ceremony, the forum began, with the 69 attending heroes divided into four groups according to their branches of service: firepower, infantry, logistics, and cadres. The forum continued until the morning of the 29th. The Mutual Aid Meritorious Service Committee then conducted evaluations, awarding Comrade Zhang Tiancai and 29 others a major merit, Comrade Feng Shaozhen and 50 others a merit, and posthumously awarding Comrade Secretary Cui and 7 other martyrs a merit. The afternoon was the formal celebration meeting, the most exciting and enthusiastic event of the conference. As the sun set, representatives from various units poured into the venue from all directions. The venue was solemnly decorated, with banners and congratulatory messages from local governments and fraternal units hung all around. The leaders of the Huai River Brigade personally attended to offer congratulations and guidance. Various leaders and hero representatives delivered speeches successively. Awards were also presented at the meeting. As the heroes stepped onto the podium one by one to receive awards personally presented by the leaders, the applause from below the stage thundered, and thousands of eyes radiated admiration, showing the heroes' boundless glory. In the evening, the Zhanfang Theater Troupe performed "Assembly of Heroes" to add to the festivities. The grand celebration meeting concluded successfully. The next day, when the heroes returned to their units, the battalion leaders again led the units directly under their command to see them off, and Political Commissar Zhang delivered a brief farewell speech, hoping that the heroes would bring the spirit of the conference back to their units and help and lead everyone to achieve meritorious service. The heroes immediately gave a resounding response: "We will definitely maintain the honor of the heroes and lead everyone to achieve meritorious service in training and in the great counter-offensive to come!"

    【本报讯】汤阴城主攻部队之一的淮河部一大队，自汲汤战斗以来，有五百多位同志立了功，各级单位都先后给他们贺功。为了继续推进立功运动，曾于五月二十七日召开全大队贺功会，会期历三天。第一天为有功单位座谈，与会的有：突破汤阳城的一分队三支队，坚守汤阴城壕一昼夜的一分队三小队，建设部队有功的二分队二支队机枪连，突破张庄前沿的三分队四小队，及纪律模范直属的五小队…………等二十二个立功单位的代表。第二日为功臣座谈会，该日各功臣所在单位，备马相送，大队首长则亲率直属单位出村远迎，锣鼓喧天，街上挤满观众，实在壮观。举行开会仪式后，即进入座谈，六十九位出席功臣按兵种不同、划为火力、步兵、后勤、干部等四小组分别座谈。座谈会持续至二十九日上午才告结束。互助立功委员会即进行评定，给张天才等三十位同志记大功一次，冯少臣等五十一位同志记功一次，给崔书记等八位烈士追记了功。下午为正式贺会，这是大会最精彩热烈的一个节目。当夕阳西下时，各单位代表自各方涌进会场，会场布置庄严，四周悬挂地方政府及兄弟部队的喜幛贺词，淮河部首长亲临致贺指导，各首长及功臣代表都先后讲了话，会上并进行授奖。当功臣们一个个步上主席台接收首长亲自递给的奖品时，台下掌声如雷，几千只眼睛发射出敬慕眼光，显示着功臣们无限荣耀。夜晚并有战防剧团演出“群英会”助兴，隆重的贺功会即于此胜利闭幕。翌日功臣们回队时，大队首长又率直属单位欢送，张政委并致简短的欢送词，希望功臣们把大会精神带回去，帮助和带领大家立功。功臣们当即给予了响亮的回答：“我们定要保持功臣的荣誉，在练兵中和将来的大反攻中带领大家都立功。”（邵永法）
