Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, June 25th: Moscow dispatch: Rynetski recently published an article in Izvestia commenting on the US expansion in Africa and the increasing Anglo-American contradictions, stating: After the war, the United States expanded and consolidated its strongholds on the African coast, aiming to transform all areas of the Mediterranean into an important part of the US global base network. The New York Times correspondent in London reported that American "operational bases" may be established on the Cyrenaica coast of North Africa to assist Greece and Turkey. The City Observer Weekly, the organ of British financiers, stated: Along with loans, the United States is prepared to provide Egypt with plans for the defense of the Suez Canal. Recently, the United States has been actively operating in the Union of South Africa, attempting to seize the key points of South African industry and commerce. The United States is now actively mining uranium in the Belgian Congo region. American monopoly capitalists want to use helping France's revitalization as a means to supply France with coal and raw materials in exchange for control of the French African colonial markets. In addition, the United States is also instigating Italian reactionaries to restore Italian colonial activities in Africa in order to carry out American expansion. Rynetski concluded: Britain can now see how its maritime arteries are being cut off by the US Navy, how US military bases are being built along these arteries, and how US dollars are seizing British colonial markets.

    【新华社陕北二十五日电】莫斯科讯：里涅茨基顷于消息报上著文评论美国在非洲的扩张及英美矛盾的增长称：战后美国扩张并巩固其在非洲海岸的据点，要把地中海所有区域变为美国全世界基地网的重要部分。纽约时报驻伦敦记者报导称：美国的“作战根据地”，可能建立在北非的昔兰尼加海岸上，以帮助希腊和土耳其。英国金融家们的机关报城市观察家周刊称：与贷款同时，美国准备好提供埃及关于苏彝士运河防务的计划。最近美国又在南非联邦积极活动，企图夺取南非工商业的要枢。美国现在正在比利时属地刚果区域中加开采铀矿。美国独占资本家们想从帮助法国复兴为手段，供给法国煤和原料去换取法属非洲殖民地市场之控制。此外，美国又策动意大利反动派在非洲恢复意大利的殖民活动以为美国进行扩张。里氏结语称：英国现在可以望见，她的海上动脉是如何地被美国海军所截断，美国的军事基地是如何沿着这一动脉而建立起来，以及美国金元是如何地夺取英国的殖民地市场。
