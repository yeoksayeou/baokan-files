[Report from this newspaper's Jinnan, 18th] Village cadres from the Fifth District of Nangong gathered to study the elimination of wasteland. An investigation revealed that there are seven types of land in the district that are fallow due to lack of management: 1. Land with undistributed harvest remains (including school and temple land), 195 mu; 2. 120 mu of mobile land reserved for households fleeing famine and for disabled veterans; 3. 69 mu of land left uncultivated by the old, weak, orphaned, and those with special reasons (such as the blind); 4. More than 30 mu of land left uncultivated by village cadres due to their busy work schedules (only by four village cadres in Zhang Village); 5. 501 mu of saline-alkali land; 6. 270 mu where seeds were sown but then killed by mole crickets; 7. Land left uncultivated due to improper fruit distribution and dislike of poor quality, with five households in Zhang Village alone leaving 20 mu uncultivated. The following methods were studied to eliminate these seven types of wasteland, totaling over 1,200 mu: 1. For undistributed land that can be distributed within three days, distribute it quickly. If there are difficulties preventing quick distribution, prioritize planting the land first. The farmers' association and village office will be responsible. Whoever it is eventually distributed to will provide the seeds. Since the labor force is made up of basic masses, no wages will be required. 2. The mobile land reserved by the farmers' association will be handled as follows: 1. Distribute it to the basic masses through a mortgaging relationship, and return it to the original household when they return. 2. Lease it to the basic masses, bachelors, and lazy people at low prices, such as 20%, 15%, or 5% (cadres should take the lead in organizing mutual aid to transform them). 3. For the old, weak, orphaned, and those with special reasons, cultivate the land by paying appropriate wages based on specific circumstances. The fundamental spirit is to organize mutual aid for exchange of labor. 4. For the land of households fleeing famine, allow close relatives to manage and cultivate it. If there are no relatives or they are unwilling to manage it, the farmers' association can be responsible for leasing it out. 5. For land left uncultivated by village cadres due to their busy work schedules, on the one hand, avoid holding meetings during the day in the future to reduce time lost. At the same time, call on them to take the lead in organizing mutual aid groups and ensure that the wasteland is planted. 6. For severely saline-alkali land, use it to leach salt. For slightly alkaline land, plow it now and wait for rain to wash away the alkalinity before planting. It can also be used to grow willow branches and other by-products. 7. For land where seeds have been eaten by mole crickets, mobilize the masses to organize joint village efforts to capture them before resowing. When sowing, seeds can be mixed with red letter powder and white arsenic to resist further mole cricket erosion. For less severe cases, replant in small patches. 8. For land left uncultivated due to unfair fruit distribution, persuade the owners to plant or redistribute within three to five days. If this is not possible, take responsibility for planting first, with the principle of not allowing any land to remain uncultivated.

　　南宫五区研究具体办法
    消灭七种荒地
    【本报冀南十八日电】南宫五区村干集会，研究消灭荒地。经调查该区共有七种地因无人管而荒芜：一、果实遣留未分的土地（学田庙田在内），一百九十五亩；二、给逃荒户、荣军按家留的机动地一百廿亩；三、老弱孤寡及有特殊原因（如瞎子）荒的地六十九亩；四、村干由于工作忙而荒地卅多亩（仅张村四个村干）；五、沙碱地五百零一亩；六、耩上出来又被蝼蛄咬死的二百七十亩，七、由于果实分配欠妥嫌坏不种而荒的，仅张庄一村五户即荒二十亩。以上七种，共一千二百余亩。对于这些荒地的消灭，研究出以下办法：一、没分的土地能在三天内分下去者快分，因有困难不能快分者先抢种上，由农会、村公所负责，将来分给谁谁拿出种籽来，劳力工资因都是基本群众，就不再要了。二、农会留的机动地采取以下办法：１、以典当关系分给基本群众，等地户回来再给该户。２、采取低价二八、一五、九五、出租给基本群众，或光棍汉及懒汉（干部带头组织互助、改造他们）。三、老弱孤寡特殊原因者，根据具体情况，用适当出工资的办法耕种。基本精神组织互助来换工。四、逃荒户的土地有近门当家者让其照管耕种，无有或不愿管者可由农会负责租种出去。五、村干由于工作忙而荒者，一方面，以后白天不开会，让他们少误工夫，同时号召他们带头组织互助组，荒地一定抢种上。六、沙碱地程度严重者可利用其淋盐，碱性轻者现在先犁起来，等下雨后把碱性追下去，抢种上。也可种柳条子等副产物。七、蝼蛄咬死的应发动群众联村组织捕捉之后再耩，耩时种籽内可掺红信、白砒，以抵制再被蝼蛄侵蚀，咬的不甚严重者可补点之。八、因果实不公的地，要在三、五天内说服使其种上或调剂，不能时就会先负责种上，以不荒地为原则。
