　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 20th. A unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army captured Huanxian City, a strongly fortified stronghold of the Chiang army in Longdong, on the 16th. Part of the defending enemy was annihilated, and the remnants abandoned all important weapons and fled northeast of Huanxian. On the 14th and 15th, the People's Liberation Army cleared the Chiang troops from the outskirts of Huanxian, defeating the Bian Derong Detachment, part of the 104th Regiment of the 35th Brigade under the 60th Brigade of the enemy 81st Division, and the 4th Regiment of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade (the 3rd Regiment of this brigade was annihilated in Yuele on the 30th of last month). By this time, the 103rd, 104th, and 178th Regiments of the 81st Division, defending Huanxian (the division has a total of four regiments, and its 179th Regiment was annihilated in Xingtai on the 30th of last month), had been compressed into the mountain fortifications on the outskirts of the city. At 5:00 AM on the 16th, the People's Liberation Army launched a fierce attack, quickly occupying its main fortifications, Wangjiayuan and Yuhuangshan. After seven hours of fierce fighting, the enemy's entire line collapsed. In addition to those annihilated, the remnants, led by Ma Zhong, the acting brigade commander (formerly the deputy brigade commander) of the 35th Brigade of the 81st Division, fled lightly armed into the barren mountains northeast of the city. A unit of the People's Liberation Army closely pursued, capturing many personnel and weapons along the way. The organizational structure of the enemy's 81st Division has now almost completely disintegrated. According to preliminary investigations, over a thousand enemy troops were killed or wounded, and six mountain guns, thirty mortars, thirty-odd light and heavy machine guns each, four brand-new trucks loaded with ammunition, several thousand bags of flour, and over fifty tents were seized. In addition, ten trucks were destroyed.
