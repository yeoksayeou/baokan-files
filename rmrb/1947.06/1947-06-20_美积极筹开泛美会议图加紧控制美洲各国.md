Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Comprehensive reports: In order to tighten its control over American countries, U.S. imperialism is actively preparing to convene a Pan-American conference, implement a "Western Hemisphere Joint Defense," and attempt to first strengthen its collusion with the reactionary factions of Canada and Argentina. This has already been criticized by Canadian public opinion. On June 3rd, the White House announced that Truman was willing to confer with Argentina and other American countries on a so-called "Western Hemisphere Mutual Aid Defense Agreement." Truman has already held talks with the Argentine ambassador to the U.S. A few days later, news spread from the Argentine capital that the Pan-American conference would be held there this summer. Following this, Truman visited Canada; he stayed in Canada for three days and has now returned to Washington. It is reported that as a result of this "visit," the reactionary faction of Canada, led by Prime Minister King, has agreed to support the reactionary foreign policy of the Truman Doctrine. "The continuation of the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Plan will occupy a major position in the Western Hemisphere defense plan." During Truman's "visit," Canadian newspapers criticized U.S. imperialism for harming Canada's independence. The *Vanguard* commented that Canadian-U.S. military joint defense not only causes Canada to participate in wars waged by the U.S., but also causes Canada to lose its independence. The *Daily Tribune* believes that U.S. imperialism is actively using money to support reactionary regimes around the world, and the Canadian reactionary faction is "gradually giving up its freedom to determine its own destiny to the United States." The *Citizen* also said that the presence of American troops on Canadian soil is dangerous for Canada.

　　美积极筹开泛美会议图加紧控制美洲各国
    【新华社陕北十六日电】综合报导：美帝国主义为了加紧控制美洲各国，积极准备召开泛美洲会议，实行“西半球联防”，并图首先加强与加拿大及阿根廷两国反动派的勾结，刻已遭到加拿大舆论之抨击。本月三日美国白宫宣布杜鲁门愿与阿根廷及美洲其他国家会商所谓“西半球联防互助协定”。杜鲁门已与阿驻美大使进行商谈。数日后阿根廷京城就传出消息，说泛美洲会议将于今夏在该地举行。继之而来的是杜鲁门访问加拿大；他在加勾留三日，现已返抵华府。据传此次“访问”结果，已取得以总理金氏为首的加拿大反动派的同意，支持杜鲁门主义的反动外交政策。“美加联防计划的延续。将于西半球防务计划中占主要地位。”在杜鲁门“访问”期间，加拿大报纸纷纷抨击美帝国主义损害加拿大之独立。先锋报评称：加美军事联防，不仅造成加拿大要参加美国所进行的战争，而且使加拿大丧失独立。每日论坛报认为：美帝国主义正积极地以金元支持世界上反动的政权，加拿大反动派正在“把决定自己的命运自由，逐渐断送给美国”。公民报也说：美国军队驻留在加拿大土地之上，对加拿大是危险的。
