　　Zuoquan Sixth District
    Village Cadres Change Their Style, Merit List Names Are Posted
    [Report from our newspaper in Zuoquan] After the rectification of the relationship between cadres and the masses in the Sixth District, many cadres have cleared their minds, not only voluntarily returning ill-gotten gains, but also actively uniting the masses. For example, Comrade Fan Yongjiu, the political director of Luotuo Village, is a disabled veteran. He originally had many disagreements with district cadres and the former political director. After rectifying the relationship, he took the initiative to talk to the district cadres and the former political director, resolving the disagreements. In particular, he made a very good self-criticism. With the relationship straightened out, his work enthusiasm is very high. During this year's spring plowing, he didn't ask the masses to plow for him. He even hobbled around with his wife carrying manure. Not only that, he also helped the militiamen participating in the war with spring plowing. Under his leadership and influence, Luotuo Village completed spring plowing the earliest. Now he proposes to save the grain he should receive and give it to the government to support the front lines. Comrade Wang Huanchao, the political director of Siping, received more than 70 comments from the masses during the rectification of the relationship between cadres and the masses. He returned a lot of ill-gotten gains, but he was not pessimistic at all. He realized his mistakes and took the initiative to approach the masses. There were five people he previously thought were problematic, and they were also the most vehement opponents of him. After he criticized himself for the style causing the problems, he actively united them. Now these five people are especially good with him. Similar cadres are present in other villages as well. Therefore, at the village cadre meeting held in the district, these two were given a major merit. In addition, the village head of West Five Fingers Village and the political directors of Nanpen, Tianmen, and Dongshan villages were each given a minor merit, and a celebration meeting was held, and a merit list was posted. After returning home, the masses gave them a warm celebration. The district also proposed to launch a greater unity movement in saving and preparing for famine, calling on all cadres to learn from them and strive to be on the list during the summary. Under this call, all the cadres enthusiastically proposed a unity competition, setting standards to see who is better at the summary meeting. (Zhushan)

　　左权六区
    村干改变作风功劳榜上题名
    【本报左权讯】六区在干群关系整顿后，有不少干部打通思想，不但自动的退出果实，而且主动的去团结了群众，如骆驼村政治主任樊永久同志，他是个残废的荣誉军人，原来和区干部及前任政治主任闹了许多意见，在整顿关系后，他主动的找区干部和前任政治主任谈话，拉通了意见，特别是检讨自己很好，关系扯通了他工作情绪很高，在今年春耕中也不用群众给他代耕，还拐着腿和老婆抬粪；不仅如此，他还帮助参战民兵春耕。骆驼村在他领导与影响下，春耕完成的最早，现在他提出节约他应领的粮食，交政府来支援前线，寺坪政治主任王焕超同志，在干群关系整顿时群众给他提出七十多条意见，他的果实退得多，但他一点也不悲观，他认识了自己的不对，主动的去接近群众，曾有五个人是以前他认为有问题的人，同时也是反对他最激烈的人，由于他自己检讨出主要是自己作风所造成的后，遂主动的去团结他们，现在这五个人和他特别的好起来了，其他各村亦有同样类此的干部。因此在区召开的村干部会议上，给他二人记大功一次。另给西五指村长、南盆、天门、东山等三村政治主任各记小功一次，并开了贺功会，贴了功劳榜，回家后群众又给他们热烈的贺功，区上并提出在节约备荒中，开展更大的团结运动，号召全体干部向他们学习，争取在总结时上榜。在这个号召下，全体干部热烈的提出团结竞赛，定出了标准要在总结会上看高低。（竹山）
