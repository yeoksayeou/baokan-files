　　Government Organs and Mines Respond to Famine Relief Call
    Immediately Begin Saving Food
    [This newspaper reported] The Rear Hygiene Department of the Military Region convened a meeting of all cadres on the 9th of this month to study the Party newspaper's call to "Develop Drought Resistance, Famine Relief Production and Thrift Campaign," and made the following decisions: 1. Each person saves two liang of rice per day, starting from the 10th; 2. Dig wild vegetables; 3. Quickly sow the cultivated wasteland, and find more wasteland to grow autumn vegetables; 4. On sideline production, the cotton spinning movement should be further promoted, calling on cadres to spin cotton when not working in the office. The meeting also decided to mobilize all comrades to carry out publicity to the masses and continue to help the masses sow seeds. (Junying)
    [This newspaper reported from Shahe] At the study meeting of all cadres and staff of the Dazhong Coal Mine Company on the 11th of this month, Yang Rong, Chairman, Drought Resistance and Famine Relief instructions were discussed. It was considered that the drought situation has formed this year, the wheat harvest is poor, and many autumn seedlings have not been sown. If it rains in the future, the autumn harvest will also be reduced. In order to overcome the current economic difficulties and support the patriotic self-defense war, everyone unanimously recognized the importance of drought resistance and famine relief, and unanimously decided that each cadre and staff member should save two liang of millet per day to prepare for the famine. (Bingfu)
    [This newspaper reported from Lucheng] Lucheng convened a meeting of cadres from more than ten factories and mines in the urban area on the 11th to discuss the call for production, thrift, drought resistance and famine relief issued by the border government and the People's Daily editorial. It was found in the discussion that most cadres and workers eat white flour every other day, some eat it every day, and some workers feel that eating and drinking a little is nothing. The workers don't care, even if they earn a few less, they still want to eat well. Some individual workers felt that saving for famine relief was a matter for government organs and the common people, because 80% of the workers had not personally experienced famine in 1943 and had not gone hungry, so they were not very enthusiastic about drought resistance and famine relief. Later, Han Zhongqun, the chairman of the tool factory union, stood up and said, "Let me tell you all about my personal experience. In 1943, my wife and children starved to death. Every day, I picked vegetables and leaves from trees, enough to eat for one day. Every day, we had three meals of vegetables, but we couldn't even get salt. The livestock were also sold, and we couldn't eat a full meal. My family members were all scattered." Speaking of this, tears fell from his eyes. Everyone became alert when they heard that they couldn't even eat bran. Wang Chengzhi said, "If you can't plant the land and harvest the grain, you won't even be able to eat bran. If you don't have grain, you'll have less bran." Everyone said, "We should actively organize the masses to think of ways and make suggestions, break the waiting mentality, and think of ways from a positive perspective to mobilize the workers ideologically." They also put forward slogans such as "Respond to the call of the superior, reduce the standard of living, eat less white flour, and don't waste." After everyone calculated the accounts, they all agreed to save three jin of white flour and sixty liang of rice per person per day. Eight factories with a total of 160 workers can save 600 jin of rice and 480 jin of flour per month. (Jinxun)
    [This newspaper reported from Licheng] No. 1 High School received drought resistance and famine relief instructions from the county government, and immediately called on all students to carry out savings and famine relief, and be vigilant against waste. Recently, under the efforts of Director of General Affairs Dong Yuexing and Wang Jianzhang, the General Affairs Office has been reorganized, made precise calculations, and saved for a long time. Saving is not to make students not have enough to eat, but to not throw away leftovers and not waste food. Under the leadership of the two of them and the efforts of all the workers, the monthly savings were summarized, and a total of 50,000 yuan of silver dollars was saved for the students. When the students heard this, they were all happy and automatically took out 19,000 yuan from the saved money to reward the workers. (Zhiyuan, Yanxi)

　　机关矿厂响应备荒号召
    立即开始节省食粮
    【本报讯】军区后方卫生部于本月九日召集所有干部开会研究党报“开展防旱备荒生产节约运动”的号召，并作出以下决定：一、每人每日节约米二两，从十日起开始执行；二、挖野菜；三、把已开的荒地赶紧下种，并再找荒地赶种秋菜；四、在副业生产上还要把纺花运动再提高一步，号召干部不办公就纺花。会上并决定动员全体同志向群众展开宣传，并继续帮助群众下种。（俊英）
    【本报沙河讯】大众煤矿公司于本月十一日全体干杂人员学习会上讨论了杨戎主席防旱备荒指示，认为今年旱象已成，麦子歉收，秋苗还有很多未下种。将来落雨，秋收亦要减成。为了克服目前经济困难，支援爱国自卫战争，大家一致认识了防旱备荒的重要，一致决定干杂人员每人每日节约小米二两，准备渡荒。（秉福）
    【本报潞城讯】潞城于十一号召开城关十余工厂矿山干部会议，讨论边府及人民日报社论生产节约防旱备荒号召，讨论中发现大部分干部工人隔一天吃顿白面，有的是天天吃，还有一部分工人觉得吃点喝点不算个啥，工人不在乎，那怕少赚几个，也要吃好饭；有个别工人，感到节约备荒是机关队伍及老百姓的事，因为有十分之八工人在四三年没有亲受过灾荒，没有饿过肚子，所以对防旱备荒劲头不大。后来工具厂工会主任韩中群立起说：“我把我亲受的实情给大家访一访吧，我四口人，在四三年饿死了老婆小孩子，每天采菜采树叶，一天只够一天吃，每天三顿菜，还吃不上盐，牲口也卖了，吃不上一顿饱饭，家里人都失散了。”说到这里，眼里掉下泪来，大家一听糠也吃不到才警惕起来。王成之说：“种不上地打不上谷，糠也吃不上，没谷糠也少。”大家说：“应该积极组织群众想办法出主意，打破等待思想，从积极方面想办法把工人从思想上发动起来。”并提出“响应上级号召，降低生活水平，少吃白面，不浪费”等口号，大家算了一下账，一齐同意每天每人省白面三斤，省米六十两，八个工厂共一百六十个工人，计一个月共能省米六百斤，省面四百八十斤。（靳勋）
    【本报黎城讯】一高接到县府防旱备荒指示，立刻号召全校同学进行节约备荒，警惕浪费。最近在事务长董曰兴、王见璋两人努力推动下，重新把事务处整顿了一下，作了精确计算，长期节约。节约不是使同学吃不饱饭，而是每顿不丢剩饭，不浪费等。在他两人带头各工友的努力下总结一月节约成绩，共给同学省下大洋五万元。同学们一听，个个心里高兴，自动从节约下的钱中抽出一万九千元来奖励工友们。（枝元、砚溪）
