Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 15th: After the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army rushed into Changtu City, Zhang Xiuyou, a new recruit who had just been liberated from the periphery of Huai'de, followed the soldiers of the Democratic Allied Army to completely eliminate the enemy artillery company in the first courtyard, capturing the artillery company commander, Wang Shinan. When Zhang Xiuyou went up to take a look, he realized that this was his righteous army artillery company commander from thirteen days ago. He immediately ran to his current company commander, Comrade Wang Yi (company commander of the Ninth Company), and reported, "We have captured the former company commander!" Comrade Wang Yi immediately stepped forward, shook Wang Shinan's hand, and comforted him, saying, "Don't be afraid, I guarantee your safety and respect your dignity. Look at the soldiers in your company from thirteen days ago, we have already given them weapons and they are charging into battle with us." Upon hearing this, Wang Shinan's fear immediately disappeared. Comrade Wang Yi then distributed all the daily necessities searched from the bunkers and trenches to each of the liberated Kuomintang soldiers, making them extremely grateful. At this time, the battle was still raging. The Ninth Company Commander set up the newly captured mortar in the courtyard and said to Wang Shinan, "If you are willing, please help us!" Wang Shinan immediately stood up, called out four of his best gunners, and personally directed the firing at the Kuomintang positions he was familiar with. He fired more than fifty rounds in a row, and when the team launched a charge, he followed the team and charged together until the end of the battle. When the Ninth Company sent him to the battalion headquarters, he said to Comrade Wang Yi, "Company Commander Wang, I am willing to be with you. I am afraid I will not find someone as good to us prisoners as you are elsewhere." Comrade Wang Yi said, "It doesn't matter, all the troops of our Communist Party are the same. As long as you lay down your weapons, you will be treated with preferential treatment."

　　刚放下武器的蒋军连长
    随即协同我军作战
    【新华社东北十五日电】当民主联军某部九连冲进昌图城后，刚从怀德外围被解放过来的新战士张秀友随同民主联军的战士将第一个院子的敌人炮兵连全部解决，俘虏了炮兵连长王仕南。当张秀友上去一看，原来这正是他十三天以前的义军炮兵连长，他随即跑到他现在的连长王谊同志（九连连长）面前报告说：“我们把以前的连长俘虏了！”王谊同志随即上前握住王仕南的手，安慰他说：“不要害怕，我保证你生命安全，尊重你的人格。你看在十三天以前你连里的战士们，我们已给他武器，同我们一起冲锋打仗了。”王仕南被这样一说，恐惧的心理随即消除了。王谊同志又将从地堡里战壕里搜索出来的日用品，全部分给了每个被解放的蒋军，使他们感激万分。这时战斗还在激烈进行，九连长将刚缴来的迫击炮在院子里架好，对王仕南说：“假若你们愿意的话，请帮帮忙！”王仕南随即站起来，叫出四个最好的炮手，亲自指挥向着他熟悉的蒋军阵地开炮，一连打了五十多发，队伍发起冲锋，他也跟着队伍一起冲去，直到战斗结束。九连将他送到营部时，他向王谊同志说：“王连长，我愿意和你在一起，在别处恐怕找不到像你对我们俘虏这样好的人。”王谊同志说：“没关系，我们共产党的部队都是一样的，只要放下武器，就受优待。”
