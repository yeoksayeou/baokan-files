Jinnan, June 1st (Our Newspaper) - Emancipated women actively participate in the rush to cultivate, plant, prevent drought, and prepare for disaster relief. The masses in Renpobu Village, the eighth district of Linqing, were inspired by recalling the suffering of the great famine in 1932 and actively planted seeds. An old woman in her sixties said, "The superiors are worried that we will starve to death, so they are taking the trouble to ask us to plant seeds. I can't carry water, but tomorrow I will have to go to the fields to plant seeds and bury them in the pits. One more person will do a little more work." The next day, in the mutual aid group led by the self-defense captain, there were nine women and thirteen children participating, planting 15 mu of cotton in one day. Women in Zaoqiang Chengguan voluntarily formed groups of three to five, helping each other to carry water to plant cotton and dig furrows to plant vegetables. Ma Huiying, the director of the women's association in West Street, and team leaders Li Jingui and Zhang Xiuqin, dug 15 furrows in one day. The next morning, before the sun rose, Huiying called up the two of them to carry water and plant vegetables. By breakfast, 85 furrows had been planted with pumpkins, fennel, chives, and other vegetables. Wang Jinhuan and Li Yucen, two young women, carried water to plant two mu of cotton and planted one mu of melons in two days. Wang Chunxi, the director of the women's association in East Street, led seven women to dig one mu of furrows in one day. After their emancipation, the women in Hanzhuang, the fourth district of Qinghe, actively participated in labor and competed with men. Sixteen women helped each other, borrowed an ox to cultivate, rake, and sow on their own. They sowed five and a half mu of land in half a day and are now carrying water to plant cotton. Among them, four elderly women, who used to work for the landlords, have now raised their awareness, participate in labor, and surpass men, planting more than two mu of cotton in half a day.
