　　【Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 10th】In Dongping New Recovered District, a re-examination campaign has been universally launched. Jiang Village has created a model of combining four types of work during the re-examination: distribution of floating wealth, land distribution, wheat harvesting, and tree distribution. On the afternoon of May 24th, the South Sub-district held a poor peasant meeting with over 1,100 people to discuss the work of land and property investigation. The next day, they returned to their respective villages to begin the re-examination. Jiang Village re-conducted three investigations of landlords who had returned home, as the previous investigations were not thorough. Villages such as Jia Village, Wangyan, Beichengzi, and Xiaoshan first distributed trees and then land. Xiaobaluan Village has basically completed the distribution. The remaining villages are in the process of distribution. On the evening of May 25th, Jiang Village held a village-wide meeting to discuss the distribution of floating wealth. Some said, "Our land is all mountainous and not enough to cultivate." Others said, "The wheat is about to ripen, and we need to prepare for harvesting." Some said, "The landlord's trees have not been fully distributed yet, and we don't even have wood to burn. We need to finish distributing the trees before we can harvest the wheat." Finally, everyone unanimously decided to carry out these four tasks simultaneously. Therefore, work was divided. The appraisal committee led everyone in forming groups on the ground, discussing the levels for distributing floating wealth. The village head, the head of the farmers' association, the group leaders, and the members of the farmers' association conducted land statistics, compiled a list of poor people, and discussed land distribution. Tree distribution was carried out by groups taking turns, while the remaining people harvested wheat. The four tasks were carried out simultaneously without affecting each other. The floating wealth was quickly distributed, and everyone was very satisfied.
    【Report from this newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 10th】In mobilizing the masses to implement land reform in the new districts of our Seventh Sub-district, a large number of activists were used, and new experiences were gained. In a certain county, the Zhichang district's three groups (a group consists of several villages) selected more than 300 activists to form a "turn-over" team, launching a vigorous movement to distribute floating wealth and organize the masses. Initially, the cadres felt that most of the activists were poor peasants who had not done any work before, and it would be difficult to manage them and not very useful. Later, after research and discussion, they came up with many solutions and believed that the more activists, the better. In addition to establishing the organization of the "turn-over" brigade, the activists were organized into reconnaissance posts, liaison groups, propaganda groups, interrogation groups, investigation and custody groups, and administrative groups in their work. Cadres were assigned to each group to lead the activists and the masses, pushing the activists to work under certain conditions. After the work in a village was completed, some of the activists from that village were retained to continue the work in the village, and some were transferred to supplement them. This can continuously cultivate activists, conduct more class discipline education, regularly summarize the day's work, assign specific tasks to the activists when dispersing, and report on the situation in their villages upon returning. This makes it easy to understand the feedback from below and facilitates practical work, while also alleviating the concerns of the activists.

　　东平新区姜庄收麦不误复查
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】东平新收复区普遍掀起复查运动，姜庄并在复查中创造了分浮财、分地、麦收、分树等四种工作结合进行范例。五月二十四日下午，南小区召开一千一百余人的贫农会议，讨论查田查财工作，次日即分别回村开始复查。姜庄对上次清查不彻底的回家地主又重新进行了三次清查。驾村、王盐、北城子、小山等村，大家先分树后分地亩，现小巴栾庄、已初步分完。其余各村正在进行，五月二十五日晚上，姜庄全村开会，讨论分浮财问题，有的说：“咱的地都是山地还不够种。”有的说：“麦子眼看就熟了，得准备打麦子。”有的说：“地主的树还没分完，现在都没有烧的，得分完树再说麦收。”最后大家一致决定这四种工作同时进行。于是进行了分工，评议会领着大家在场内编组，讨论分浮财的等级，村长、农会长、组长、农会委员进行地亩统计，编造贫民清册讨论分地；分树按组轮流出人，其余的人收麦，四种工作同时进行，互不影响，浮财很快就分完了，大家都很满意。
    【本报冀鲁豫十日电】我七分区新区在发动群众实行土地改革中，大量使用积极分子，并获得新经验。某县纸场区三个组（十数村称一组）抽调了三百多积极分子成立翻身队，开展轰轰烈烈的分浮财及组织群众的大运动。开始，干部都感觉积极分子多是贫农，没做过工作，多了不好管理，也使用不着。后经过研究讨论，想出不少的办法，认为积极分子越多越好，积极分子除建立翻身大队的组织外，在工作中组织侦察岗哨联络组、宣传组、审讯组、清查保管组、事务组、干部分到各个组带领积极分子，带领群众，在一定的火候下推动积极分子去做，将一村里的工作进行完，就把这个村里的积极分子留下一部，继续进行本村工作，再抽一部补上。这样能够不断的培养积极分子，多进行阶级纪律教育，经常总结一天的工作，分散时布置积极分子一定的工作，回来时汇报本村情况，容易了解下面的反映，便于切合实际的进行工作，也免掉积极分子的顾虑。
