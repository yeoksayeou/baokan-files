Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 16th: Rice riots have expanded to Shenmu County, Northern Shaanxi. On May 3rd, Chiang Kai-shek's Yulin Public Office ordered Shenmu County to increase its military grain levy by 7,000 bags (each bag containing seven large dou), demanding it be delivered within seven days. This caused grain prices to skyrocket, from 40,000 to 80,000 (Chiang) currency per dou. The poor in the urban area, unable to bear the hunger, gathered more than a hundred people on May 27th to snatch grain and eat sesame cakes on the street. Chiang Kai-shek's county government sent police to suppress them, resulting in chaos and the dispersal of the starving people. On June 4th, more than 700 residents of Xinyi Township in the county gathered and entered the city to surround the county government, demanding the exemption of grain taxes. The turmoil lasted for three days, and Chiang Kai-shek's county magistrate was forced to allow a postponement of the levy, and the disturbance temporarily subsided.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 16th: According to citizens who recently escaped from Yan'an, the prices of goods in Yan'an after the bandit Hu's occupation are ten times higher than before the occupation. White flour is 8,000 (Chiang) currency per jin, and millet is 10,000 (Chiang) currency per jin. These two main food grains are ten times higher than before the occupation. Pork is 8,000 (Chiang) currency per jin, oil is 8,000 (Chiang) currency per jin, and salt is 3,000 (Chiang) currency per jin. The sources of these three daily necessities have been almost completely cut off due to Chiang Hu's occupation of Yan'an. Many citizens are now filling their stomachs with wild vegetables mixed with a little rice porridge. Due to the cutoff of fuel sources, the pseudo-county government has ordered the demolition of public buildings in the Dongguan and Beiguan areas to be used as fuel. Now the Cultural Gully in Beiguan and the Heilong Gully in Dongguan have been turned into rubble. On the streets, only the so-called "merchants" who came with the bandit Hu forcibly occupy civilian houses and open businesses. Besides a few daily necessities, the shelves are mostly filled with American-made cigarettes.
　　In the concentration camp of a so-called "Youth Reception Center" in the back gully of the new market in Nanguan, some innocent young people are being held. Recently, the enemy has been extremely panicked and is rushing to build fortifications on the main thoroughfares of the city, with bunkers densely packed on the old city walls. In addition, the entire city of Yan'an is wrapped in barbed wire. From Huashibian Mountain outside the South Gate, through the mountains behind the market, around Xishan to the top of the Cultural Gully Mountain, then down the mountain again, and from Wangjiaping up the mountain, around Qingliang Mountain, the airport, and Pagoda Mountain outside the East Gate to Baijiaping Mountain outside the South Gate, connecting with Huashibian, the entire city is only left with three iron gate barriers. No one is allowed to enter or leave the city day or night, and Hu's troops are guarding the mountain tops, afraid to come down.

　　蒋记榆林公署勒索军粮
    物价暴涨造成饥荒神木贫民被迫抢食
    【新华社晋绥十六日电】米骚已扩大至陕北神木县。五月三日蒋记榆林公署下令神木县增收军粮七千包（每包七大斗），并限七日交齐，引起粮价暴涨，每斗由蒋币四万跃至八万。城关贫民不堪饥饿，五月二十七日集合百余人在大街上抢夺粮食和抢吃烧饼，蒋记县府派警镇压，秩序大乱，饥民被冲散。六月四日该县信义乡居民七百余人，纠集入城包围县府，要求免除粮款，骚动延续三日，蒋记县长被迫允许缓征，骚动始暂告平息。
    【新华社西北十六日电】据日前从延安逃出之市民谈称：胡匪侵占后的延安物价，较侵占前均高涨十倍。白面每市斤蒋币八千元，小米每斤蒋币一万元。该两项主要食粮，较侵占前均高十倍。猪肉每市斤蒋币八千元，油每市斤蒋币八千元，盐每市斤蒋币三千元，该三项日用食品，由于蒋胡侵占延安，来源已几告断绝。许多市民现以野菜渗合少许米粥充饥。市内烧柴亦因来源断绝，伪县政府命令拆毁东关北关一带公共建筑，以作燃料。现北关文化沟、东关黑龙沟一带，均已变成一片瓦砾。街市上只有随胡匪而来的所谓“商人”，强占民房，开市营业，货架上除了少许日用品外，大都全为美造香烟所充塞。
    在南关新市场后沟，有一名日“青年招待所”的集中营里面，关押着一些无辜的青年。近日来敌恐慌万分，在市内各通衢要道，赶筑工事，旧城墙上碉堡密布。另将延安市全包上铁丝网。从南门外花市砭上山，经市场后沟山头，绕过西山到文化沟山顶，又扯下山再从王家坪上山，绕过东门外清凉山，飞机场，宝塔山到南门外白家坪下山，与花石砭相接，全市只留三个铁栅门，市内外不得出入，白天夜晚，胡军都守在山头不敢下山。
