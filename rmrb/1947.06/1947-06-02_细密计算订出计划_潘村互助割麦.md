　　Detailed Calculations Lead to Plans
    Pan Village Mutual Aid Wheat Harvesting
    [This newspaper's Jinan, Hebei, 31st dispatch] After careful calculation, Pan Village in Wei County formulated a wheat harvesting plan, breaking the "blind harvesting" mentality. Seeing that the wheat was about to be harvested, the villagers, due to fewer people available for stretcher-bearing duties, discussed among themselves, "This year, some of the wheat is bound to be left unharvested." The Farmers' Association investigated the village's wheat fields and labor force. Except for the military families, who were subject to "contracted responsibility" (assigned specific people to cultivate on their behalf), the entire village had twelve *qing* of wheat fields and one hundred and twenty-four strong laborers who could wield a sickle. On average, each person would have to harvest more than nine *mu*. If the more than one hundred and thirty elderly, young, and women half-laborers were added, it could be harvested in two days. After this investigation was announced to the masses, the worry of "blind harvesting" was dispelled. At the all-members congress of female farmers, the following plan was discussed by team units: men, women, old, and young all go to the fields together, first harvesting for military families providing stretcher-bearers. Military families will be harvested by the original substitute cultivators. Those who are on war service will be harvested by villagers on their behalf, and the wheat supervisor will provide meals. On average, each full laborer bears more than one *mu*. Families with more land voluntarily organize small mutual aid groups of three or four families. Those without oxen, carts, or threshing grounds will provide mutual aid to those with carts and oxen. Children under fourteen and over seven years old will organize wheat-picking mutual aid groups. Family members of military personnel and stretcher-bearers will also go to the fields together. The Farmers' Association self-defense squad leader and team leaders are responsible for supervising and inspecting, and resolving difficulties in a timely manner. After the above plan was unanimously approved, Kong Laoen, who was over seventy years old, said on the spot: "It is only right for my youngest son to serve as a stretcher-bearer to fight Chiang Kai-shek. Everyone is busy with their work. I can work. I will harvest all of my own wheat and do not need any help." Another six or seven families of stretcher-bearers took the lead in saying they would not let everyone harvest on their behalf. Under the slogan of "learning from Kong Laoen," men, women, old, and young set off a competition, all volunteering to harvest more.

　　细密计算订出计划
    潘村互助割麦
    【本报冀南卅一日电】威县潘村经过细密计算，订出麦收计划，打破“瞎麦”思想。该村群众眼看麦子要收，人力因出担架少了，都纷纷议论：“今年麦子总得瞎老些了。”农会把全村的麦地与劳动力加以调查，除军属实行“包干”（专人负责代耕）外，全村尚有麦十二顷，能掌镰的强劳动力一百廿四人，平均每人得割九亩多，若再加上一百三十多老、少、妇女的半劳力，两天也可割完。这个调查向群众宣布后，“瞎麦”的忧虑就被打消了。在农妇会员全体大会上，以分队为单位，讨论出如下计划：男女老少一齐下地，先割军属出担架的，军属由原有代耕人负责收割，出战勤的由村人代割，麦主管饭。平均每个整劳力负担一亩多，地多各家自愿组织小型三、四家互助，没牛没车没场和有车有牛的互助，十四岁以下、七岁以上的儿童，组织拾麦互助组，军属、出担架的男女老少也一齐下地，农会自卫分队长、组长负责督促检查，及时解决困难。在一致通过以上计划后，当场七十多岁的孔老恩说：“我小儿出担架打老蒋是理所应当，大家活忙，我能劳动，全部自割别帮助我了。”另有六、七家出担架的家属都争先提出不让大家代割，在“学习孔老恩”的口号下，男女老少掀起竞赛，都自报多割。
