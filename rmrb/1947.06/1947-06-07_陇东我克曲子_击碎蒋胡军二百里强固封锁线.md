　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army continues to expand its victories in the Longdong area. On the 31st of last month, it captured Quzi County (that is, Quzi Town between Huan County and Qingyang) in one fell swoop, as well as several important towns to its north and south. The Chiang-Hu troops' 200-li strong defense line along the Huanjiang River, from Qingyang in the south to Huan County in the north, was completely shattered in two days. The remnants of the Chiang-Hu troops' 2nd Cavalry Brigade and others guarding this area fled westward in a panic. The results of the battle are still being tallied. In addition to Quzi City, the important towns recovered in this battle include Fucheng, 60 li north of Qingyang, Maling, 80 li north of Qingyang, and Mubo, 50 li northwest of Quzi. Currently, there are no traces of Chiang-Hu troops in the hundreds of li area spanning Quzi and Huachi counties. On the 2nd, the Chiang army's Independent 5th Cavalry Regiment (originally the 2nd Cavalry Division of Ma Bufang) conducted reconnaissance activities southward from Huan County. When they encountered a small detachment of the People's Liberation Army, they were immediately defeated. The People's Liberation Army captured 100 warhorses and 50 prisoners. In addition, in the war of annihilation outside Heshui, the People's Liberation Army killed or wounded over a thousand of the Chiang-Hu troops' warhorses.

　　陇东我克曲子
    击碎蒋胡军二百里强固封锁线
    【新华社陕北五日电】西北人民解放军于陇东地区继续扩张战果，上月卅一日一举收复曲子（即原环县庆阳间之曲子镇）县城，及其南北数重镇。沿环江南起庆阳，北迄环县之蒋胡军二百华里强固封锁线，两天内被彻底粉碎。据守此一地区之蒋胡军骑二旅等残部，狼狈向西逃跑。战果正清查中。此役除曲子城外，收复之重镇计有庆阳北六十华里之阜城，八十华里之马岭等及曲子西北五十华里之木钵。现曲子、华池两县纵横数百里地区已无蒋胡军踪迹。二日蒋军独立骑兵第五团（原马步芳之骑兵第二师改编）由环县向南作侦察性活动，当与人民解放军小部遭遇，立被击溃。解放军缴获战马百匹，俘其五十人。又合水外围之诱歼战争；解放军毙伤蒋胡军之战马即在千匹以上。
