(From our newspaper in Taiyue, 14th) Various places in Taiyue are implementing self-sufficiency in village funds through production, reducing the burden on the people, and creating three models. Several villages in Yangcheng, Yuanqu, and Jiyuan have already achieved self-sufficiency in village funds and no longer apportion expenses to the masses. (1) Starting from scratch without relying on the masses or leadership assistance. Zhao Rushan, the village chief of Masi Village in the Fifth District of Yangcheng, organized the three donkeys from his, the deputy village chief's, and the finance committee member's families, and the cadres took turns transporting goods. They also opened a dyeing workshop. In addition to solving the village office's annual expenses and the living needs of six people, they now have a surplus of three *shi* of beans and one *shi* of sesame. (2) Actively laboring to generate profits from scratch. For example, the militia of Qiaogou Village in Duba Township, Jiyuan, started reclaiming 18 *mu* of wasteland in the gaps between battles in April of last year. In July, they bought a cotton gin. In December of last year, they opened a flour mill. In eight months, in addition to some expenses for the militia, they were completely self-sufficient. (3) Borrowing money and designating specific people to engage in production. Currently, Zhao Yuqing, the village chief of various mountain villages, borrowed 20,000 yuan and found a production worker to handle items such as flowers, salt, and cloth. The money earned through production was used to buy two pigs for breeding and profit. From July of last year to March of this year, 960 *jin* of local grain was saved, and the expenses of the village office were solved. Now there are still four pigs, and the cash on hand totals 95,800 yuan.

　　太岳各地村干部动手
    生产解决村款开支
    【本报太岳十四日电】太岳各地实行村款生产自给，减轻人民负担，创造三种范例。阳城、垣曲、济源若干村就已做到村款生产自给不再向群众摊派。（一）白手创家不依靠群众与领导上的帮助。阳城五区马赛村长赵如山将他和副村长、财政委员家里的三头毛驴组织在一起，干部轮流运输。又开了一坐染房，赚下钱除解决村公所一年开支及六个人生活所需外，现在还剩豆子三石、芝麻一石。（二）积极劳动，白手生利。如济源杜八联的乔沟村民兵，去年四月开始在战斗空隙开荒十八亩，七月买轧花机一架轧花，去年十二月又开粉坊一座。八个月来，除民兵一些费用外，完全自给。（三）借钱指定专人生产，目前各山村长赵余庆借款两万元，找了一个生产员，搞了些花、盐、布匹等，生产赚的钱买了两口猪，来回生利，自去年七月到今年三月，节省了九百六十斤地方粮，并解决了公所的开支，现在还有四口猪，和现金加起来共有九万五千八百元。
