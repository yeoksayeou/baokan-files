　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd: Comprehensive reports from various sources indicate that on the eve of the June 2nd Anti-Civil War Day, when students across the country are calling for strikes by students, workers, and businesses, the fascist leader Chiang Kai-shek's policy of terror and suppression is being intensified in major cities under Chiang's control. In Shanghai, in addition to the recent arrest of over a hundred people from universities and colleges such as Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Fudan University, Great China University, Shanghai Law School, Medical College, Business School, and New China College, secret mass arrests are continuing. According to the Associated Press, as of the 1st, at least two hundred student leaders had been arrested. Tianjin "announced martial law" on the 1st, prohibiting all gatherings and cutting off transportation, and arrested over twenty students and citizens. Kaifeng announced "emergency measures" on the 1st and imposed "citywide martial law." In addition to the 44 students arrested at Henan University on the 29th, another 45 people, including civil servants, students, teachers, and journalists, so-called "suspects," were searched and arrested from house to house on the 1st. Shenyang announced special martial law on the 1st and arrested six people in charge of the Northeast University Student Union. Guangzhou announced martial law on the 1st. Thousands of people from Sun Yat-sen University and other schools held anti-hunger and anti-civil war demonstrations on the 31st. In addition to those arrested, hundreds of "workers" disguised as Chiang's military police violently beat them, with dozens injured and five seriously injured. Chongqing announced "temporary martial law" from the 1st and arrested over a hundred people from various schools and newspaper offices, and several people were shot. Chengdu arrested 38 so-called "rioters" on the 31st. In Wuhan, the arrest of students led to an incident in which military police opened fire and killed a student from Wuhan University. People from all walks of life in Beijing and Shanghai believe that such cruel and unreasonable measures by Chiang's military police cannot stop the continued rise of the student movement. According to the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, "Professors from National Peking University and Tsinghua University issued a declaration on May 29th, protesting that no harsh measures can calm the students. Beating students, suppressing parades, and closing newspapers—the government itself is destroying the law and disrupting order, and is having a very bad influence on the academic atmosphere. This violation of discipline must be stopped immediately." According to a report from the French News Agency on the 31st, even Dr. Hu Shih, the president of Peking University who has always supported Chiang Kai-shek, came out to say: "The student movement against civil war and against hunger was not instigated by the Communist Party, nor was it organized by the Communist Party. The student movement cannot be stopped by force." He also hoped that the Chiang government would not use means of suppression and persecution when holding strikes and demonstrations on June 2nd, because "the student movement is like a torrent, and it cannot be stopped by building a dam."
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] The news of the vigorous development of the student anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement in the Chiang-controlled areas, especially the occurrence of the "May 20th" massacre, filled all faculty, staff, and students of Peking University with righteous indignation. They immediately telegraphed the "May 20th" Massacre Relief Association and all the heroic and patriotic students in the Chiang-controlled areas to express their condolences and support. They also vowed to support them with practical actions such as intensifying their studies, work, and production. (Tang Tao, Kang Zhi)

　　蒋介石对学潮恐惧得发抖
    各大城市普遍戒严
    北大声援蒋区学生反内战反饥饿运动
    【新华社陕北二日电】综合各方报导：在全国学生号召罢课、罢工、罢市之六二反内战日前夕，法西斯头子蒋介石之恐怖镇压政策正在蒋区各大城市加紧施行。上海除日前逮捕交大、同济、复旦、大夏、上海法学院、医学院、商学院、新建等大中学校一百余人外，正继续秘密大批逮捕。据美联社称：至一日止，至少有二百余学生领袖被捕。天津于一日“宣布戒严”，禁止一切集会与断绝交通，并逮捕学生市民廿余人。开封一日宣布“急紧措置”，“全市戒严”，除二十九日于河南大学捕去学生四十四人外，于一日又按户搜捕公务人员、学生、教员、新闻记者等所谓“嫌疑分子”四十五人。沈阳一日宣布特别戒严，并捕去东北大学自治会负责人六人。广州一日宣布戒严，中山大学等学校数千人于三十一日举行反饥饿反内战示威大游行，除被捕者外，当被蒋家军警乔装之“工人”数百人痛殴，有数十人受伤，五人受重伤。重庆一日起宣布“临时戒严”，并于各学校，报馆捕去百余人，枪伤数人。成都三十一日逮捕所谓“暴乱分子”三十八人。武汉因逮捕学生，致发生宪警开枪击毙武大学生事件。京沪各界认为，蒋家宪警此种残酷无理措施，并不能阻止学生运动的继续高涨。据沪大公报称：“国立北京大学与清华大学教授于五月二十九日发表宣言，抗议称：没有什么严酷的措施能使学生平静。殴打学生，镇压游行，封闭报纸——政府自己就正在毁法乱纪，就正在给学风以很坏的影响。这种违犯纪律必须立即予以制止。”据法国新闻处三十一日电称：连向来给蒋介石捧场的北京大学校长胡适博士都出来表示：“反内战反饥饿的学生运动不是共产党煽动的，也不是共产党组织的，学生运动不是武力能够制止住的。”他并且希望蒋政府于六月二日举行罢课和示威游行的时候，不要使用镇压和迫害的手段，因为“学生运动像一股洪流，是不能筑一条堰来挡住它的。”
    【本报讯】蒋管区学生反内战反饥饿运动激烈开展的消息传来，特别是“五、二○”惨案的发生，北大全体教职学员莫不义愤填膺，当即电“五、二○”惨案后援会及蒋管区全体英勇爱国同学，表示慰问与支援。并誓以加紧学习、工作、生产等实际行动来支援他们。（唐涛、康志）
