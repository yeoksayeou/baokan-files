Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 31st: TASS, Tehran dispatch: The escalating intrusion of American forces into Iran has aroused increasing vigilance among the broad masses of Iranian people. For example, the democratic *Mardam* newspaper stated, "The US military delegation in Iran has not only failed to help improve the people's situation but, on the contrary, has become a heavy burden on the people's shoulders. Furthermore, they have damaged Iran's friendly relations with certain major powers." The opinions of many Tehran newspapers, which by no means belong to the left-wing democratic camp, are also very clear. For example, the *Rad-e Emruz* newspaper said in its editorial: "We hope that Mr. Truman will not force the Iranian people in choosing their way of life... During this critical period, the responsibility of Iranian politicians is to base their policies on the principles of progress and the nation. These politicians must know that any violation of these principles will endanger Iran's independence." Another right-wing newspaper, *Khavar Zamin*, also said in its editorial: "The Iranian people maintain friendship with the Soviet people and do not want to harm it for the benefit of the United States. The United States must remember that Iran is not Greece, not Turkey. Iran will not become the United States' police force in Asia." The newspaper also said in another article: "Our readers and all the nations of the East must be vigilant and not be deceived by the sophistry of American policy."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: TASS, Cairo dispatch: The *Al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun* newspaper recently commented on the one million dollar loan granted by the United States to Yemen for the purchase of American war surplus materials, stating: "Recently, Yemen and the United States signed an agreement on purchasing one million dollars worth of American war surplus materials. Foreign loans are an unfortunate beginning—the first nail hammered into the coffin of Yemen's freedom. The United States will use this loan to expand its economic power and the political power that follows; Egypt has already experienced the policy of foreign loans, which has plunged Egypt into a disastrous situation, becoming a foreign colony and occupied area. American power has recently expanded to Saudi Arabia, and we can already see the signs of disaster threatening that country. Now American power is about to extend to Yemen." (Note: Yemen is located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle East, with an area of 75,000 square miles and a population of approximately three million. It is an independent sheikhdom.)

　　伊朗人民日益警惕
    决不做美国的奴隶
    美国侵略魔手又伸到也门
    【新华社陕北卅一日电】塔斯社德黑兰讯：美国势力加剧的侵入伊朗，引起了广大伊朗人民日益增长的警惕。例如，民主的马尔达姆报称：“美驻伊军事代表团不特没有协助改进人民的情况，相反地却构成了人民肩上的重担。此外，他们还损害了伊朗与某些强国间的友好关系。”许多绝非属于左翼民主阵营的德黑兰报纸的言论也是很明显的。例如，拉德·伊姆鲁兹报在其社论中说：“我们希望杜鲁门先生在伊朗人民选择他们的生活方式中，不要强迫他们……。在这严重的时期，伊朗政治家的责任就是把他们的政策建立在进步和民族的原则基础上。这些政治家必须知道，任何对这些原则的违反都会危及伊朗的独立。”另一右翼报纸哈瓦尔札民报亦在其社论中说：“伊朗人民与苏联人民维持着友谊，并且不愿为美国的利益而侵害它。美国必须牢记，伊朗不是希腊，不是土耳其。伊朗将不变成美国在亚洲的警察队。”该报又在另一论文中说：“我们的读者和东方的一切民族必须严加警惕，不让自己为美国政策的诡辩所欺骗。”
    【新华社陕北三十日电】塔斯社开罗讯：《也尔·伊万也尔·慕思里明》报顷就美国贷给也门的购买美国战争剩余物资的一百万元贷款发表评论称：“日前，也门与美国签订了关于购买一百万元的美国战争剩余物资的协定。外国的贷款是一个很不幸的开端——第一颗钉子钉进了装殓也门之自由的棺材。美国将要利用这个贷款扩张它的经济势力和跟着来的政治势力；埃及早已试验过外国贷款的政策，这种政策使埃及陷于灾难的情况中，成为外国的殖民地与占领区。美国的势力最近已经扩展到沙特阿拉伯，我们已能看到威胁这个国家的灾难的征兆。现在美国的势力又将扩展到也门。”（按：也门位于中东阿拉伯半岛的西南部，面积七万五千方英里，人口约三百万，为一独立之酋长国。）
