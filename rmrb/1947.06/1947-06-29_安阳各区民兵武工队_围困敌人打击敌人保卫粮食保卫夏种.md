　　Anyang District Militias and Armed Work Teams
    Surround and Strike the Enemy, Protect Grain, and Protect Summer Planting

    [Reported by this newspaper] When the People's Liberation Army surrounding Anyang shifted its positions, the district militias and demolition teams, Ren Wenliang Armed Work Team, and Zhang You Armed Work Team, singing songs such as "Surround Anyang, trap the enemy to death, starve the enemy to death," rushed to the front day and night. The command headquarters also moved forward and began official operations. New kill-the-enemy reward methods and merit books were printed, and the county trained specialized demolition teams for the front-line districts. The teams discussed how to protect grain and summer planting with weapons, mobilized the masses in the border villages to clear out their houses and transfer, so that the enemy's grain robbery would fail, and how to mobilize the masses in the anti-grain robbery struggle. On the 13th, the enemy's "Homecoming Corps" concentrated more than 1,000 troops and robbed more than 19,000 jin of wheat from ten villages including Balizhuang, Zhidu, and Meiyuanzhuang, all of which were repelled by our militia. On the 15th, the enemy divided into several routes to rob grain from various villages of Daxiaopo, and in Xibalizhuang, they stepped on five landmines buried by Niu Ji'er demolition team, an internship unit of the county's armed training class, which blew up two die-hard soldiers, tearing them limb from limb. Niu Linsheng, director of the Eighth District Armed Committee, and his militia team shot down two enemies with cold shots. When the enemy robbing grain at Dapo was running around, the people said, "Come and drink the soup." The enemy scolded, "Damn it, look, the Eighth Route Army is attacking, and you're still asking us to drink the soup." As a result, not a single grain of food was robbed. The masses made food for the enemy while calling the militia to fight them. On the 16th, they divided into several routes to rob grain and saw trees in Houqilidian. They stepped on five landmines buried in the northeast of the village by Wang Bin and Wang Yun, two demolition team members from our Ninth District, and four soldiers from the 318th Regiment of the 40th Division were blown to pieces. The militia rushed to drive the enemy away, preventing them from entering the village. The enemy from the experimental farm went to Meiyuanzhuang and Baianfen three times to rob grain, but were driven away by our Zhang You Armed Work Team, and one enemy was wounded. On the 14th, two battalions of the 117th Regiment of the enemy at Wangdu robbed seven carts of wheat at Danizhuang and stabbed to death two old people who resisted the grain robbery. Another group of enemies robbed 30 dan of wheat in Shuangta and also killed eleven old people. Six old people in Dongdaxing were also killed. Because of the enemy's atrocities, Comrade Li Chunyi from the Fourth District led the militia to harass the enemy on one hand and laid mines to meet the enemy on the other. On the 18th, the enemy divided into several routes to rob grain in Danizhuang and Shuangta, and stepped on the landmines we buried north of Guowangdu Village, which blew up three enemies, tearing them limb from limb. The remaining enemies forced two old people to pick up the legs near the exploding mine. Our militia shot from all directions, and the enemy, enraged, fired more than 20 shells at Shuangta and rolled back. The people of ×× Village, eight miles away from the city, said: We can't live like this anymore, we must fight! They secretly sent people to find the militia, asking for weapons to fight the enemy. The militias who won the above anti-grain robbery battles were all commended and rewarded by the county command, and recorded in the merit book. Now the front-line militias are trying their best to complete their plans to kill the enemy and make greater contributions to the people. (Anyang Armed Committee Correspondent Group)
