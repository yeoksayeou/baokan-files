　　With Strong Government Support
    Dongping Carries Out Anti-Reversal of Land Reform

    [Report from this newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Correspondent on the 31st] After Dongping was recovered, the democratic government strongly supported the masses and launched a movement against the reversal of land reform. In the Ershilipu area of the county, special agents were very active, and the masses were very panicked. After Comrade Wang Yuanjiang of our Public Security Bureau conducted an in-depth investigation and understanding of the situation, he detained Qin Peishan, the puppet town chief, Sun Zhijian, the puppet Bao chief of Zhuangkou Village, and bad landlords who reversed land redistribution. The masses in the villages around Ershilipu immediately mobilized to launch a movement to oppose the reversal of land reform and seek revenge, and organized armed joint defense.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 31st] Land reform in the newly recovered areas of Zichuan has been largely completed. In the county's eleven districts and six hundred and twenty-three villages, Panlong and eight other districts with more than five hundred villages have been completely completed. Kunlun and three other districts are also greatly distributing land. In Panlong and Longquan districts alone, farmers and workers have obtained 73,386 mu of land, 28,125 jin of grain, and floating wealth worth about 14.36 million yuan in silver. During the land reform, a total of three thousand poor peasants, farm laborers, workers, and models of emancipation in the county were elected by the people as village cadres. The newborn people's power has been rapidly and universally established in various villages, and mass organizations such as militia, workers', peasants', youth, and women's associations have been widely organized. In Panlong and Longquan districts alone, 20,000 workers and farmers have poured into trade unions, peasant associations, and land protection teams. In Chejiazhuang, Hongshan District, 64% of the entire population has been organized. ×××, a model of women's emancipation in ×× Village, Panlong District, led the masses in the entire village to emancipate themselves and was elected as the chairman of the Women's Federation. Her family of nine, except for two who were participating in the revolution elsewhere, had all joined the association. Her husband was the militia captain, her daughter-in-law was the leader of the literacy class, her fourteen-year-old son was the leader of the children's corps, and fifteen-year-old Xiuzhi and eleven-year-old Xiulan were also active figures in the literacy class, hence the reputation of "the whole family is revolutionary, no one is illiterate". Zhang Shude, who suffered from mental illness due to the hardship of being enslaved by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents during the enemy occupation, has also recovered because of the distribution of land. The vast number of farmers love Chairman Mao even more and have requested to join the Communist Party. Their enthusiasm for supporting the front lines and protecting the land has increased even further. After the first batch of 7,000 stretcher bearers set off for the front lines, the second batch of 7,600 people immediately departed one after another.
