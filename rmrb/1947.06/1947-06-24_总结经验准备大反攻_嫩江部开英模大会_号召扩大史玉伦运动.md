　　Summarize Experience to Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive
    Nenjiang Troops Hold Hero-Model Conference
    Call to Expand the Shi Yulun Movement
    [This paper's Yu-Bei Frontline 20th dispatch] (delayed) General Liu Bocheng's "Nenjiang" troops' Hero-Model Conference grandly opened at 5:00 PM on the 15th amidst the sounds of artillery salutes and military music. (The news reported on page one of this newspaper on June 14th, “Nenjiang” troops' Battlefield Meritorious Persons Conference opened on the 8th, the "Nenjiang" troops were mistakenly the 32nd troops.) Shi Yulun, Li Zhiwu and other eight hundred and sixty-seven heroes and models attended the conference. Nearby masses and political and civilian organizations flocked to offer their congratulations. After the conference began, a senior general of the troops gave the opening speech, focusing on summarizing the past New Heroism Movement, pointing out that today, as we are fully preparing for a major counteroffensive, all hero-models must play a leading role ideologically, and must carry out an extremely broad meritorious service movement of "Rendering Meritorious Service for the People, Rendering Meritorious Service for Our Troops". After the first Hero-Model Conference on December 15th of last year, the Shi Yulun squad was discovered. From now on, we must carry out the Shi Yulun squad movement, create countless model squads, model platoons, and model companies. Afterwards, Director Jia, representative of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army, gave a congratulatory speech, expressing sincerity in congratulating all hero-models and learning from all heroes. He also stated: "Our Northwest Democratic Allied Army is also wholeheartedly and fully preparing for a major counteroffensive, determined to work together to end the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship, wipe out Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, and strive for the victory of all the Chinese people!" All the heroes cheered: "The Northwest Democratic Allied Army is the people's army, let us unite and prepare for a major counteroffensive! Eliminate the reactionaries!" The conference adjourned at 10 PM. (Fang De)
    [This paper's Yu-Bei Frontline 22nd dispatch] The "Nenjiang" troops' Hero-Model Conference has been conducting research on combat techniques and wartime political work in recent days. The leadership methods of the Shi Yulun squad are highly valued by the heroes and models, sparking heated discussions. In his report, Shi Yulun talked about how to meet the major counteroffensive: "In the major counteroffensive, whether in work or combat, we cannot stick to the old ways. We must create more new methods to complete glorious tasks." The director of the troops' political department called out at the conference: First, rely on all hero-models to form a mass line where everyone thinks of solutions, bring about more heroes in the major counteroffensive, and create more model squads, platoons, and even teams. Second, launch the Shi Yulun movement in the entire troops, break the conservative concept of hindering the movement, and make it the central work of the troops. Next, everyone must study and create more. Each company must have a Shi Yulun squad to create a collective movement. Third, the heroes must make their squads, platoons, companies, and even the entire troops into models of cherishing the masses, requiring the hero-models to not only take the lead, but also fight against all destructive phenomena. The closing ceremony of the conference was held on the 17th. On that day, local masses presented glory flowers to the heroes amidst the sounds of military music. Then, the leaders of the troops awarded the Shi Yulun squad a red banner with "Model of the Three Armies" inscribed on it. This banner was presented to the Hero-Model Conference by the border region government. Other awards were given to Ren Jingzhi's model mutual aid group, Wang Dongfa's model company for mass discipline, Ji Changfu, Li Heikuan, and the mortar and artillery company communications group's establishment of a door panel newspaper, etc. (Fang De)
