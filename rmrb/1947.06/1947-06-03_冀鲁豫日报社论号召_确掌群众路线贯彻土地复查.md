　　【Additional News】The Jilu Yu Daily published an editorial entitled "How to Implement and Complete the Task of Land Re-examination." After pointing out the achievements of the land reform movement in the past five months, the editorial also pointed out the shortcomings in the movement, and reviewed the reasons for these shortcomings. In addition to underestimating the reactionary nature of the feudal decadent class, the main reason was that the leadership did not sufficiently follow the mass line, dared not boldly entrust the party's policies to the masses, and did not know how to use mass organizations to promote work. Some people also had a distorted interpretation of the mass line, believing that following the mass line meant pushing the work tasks to the masses, and the masses would naturally and correctly carry them out, without deeply enlightening the masses with the party's policies, nor patiently leading the masses together. Following the mass line is to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and to concentrate the positive and bright aspects of the masses in order to overcome the negative and backward aspects of the masses, but some people always mistakenly regard the backwardness of the masses as the opinion of the masses, thus becoming detached from the masses and lagging far behind the masses. In the future, we must first overcome these confused ideas, and the leadership must correctly follow the mass line. Secondly, in order to consolidate the advantage of the peasants, we must universally and fully mobilize the peasants, who account for more than 90% of the population, that is, we must organize the majority of the peasants. Therefore, in the future, the leadership must face backward villages and backward masses, and mobilize backward villages and people. This is a more arduous task, and we must fully use organizational strength and work more patiently from reality. Therefore, we cannot rely solely on a small number of cadres who are detached from production to do this; we must fully use the power of mass organizations, boldly mobilize advanced villages to mobilize backward villages, and mobilize activists to mobilize backward elements, and organize more than 90% of the peasants into the re-examination. To this end, we must clarify the policy of uniting with the middle peasants, and emphasize that large villages should take care of small villages, and that middle and poor peasants should unite together to win the victory of the struggle. In order to strengthen the power of the peasants, we must pay attention to mobilizing women to rise up and fight against the feudal landlord class together with the peasants in the re-examination.

　　冀鲁豫日报社论号召
    确掌群众路线贯彻土地复查
    【另讯】冀鲁豫日报以“如何贯彻和完成土地复查任务”为题发表社论。于指出五个月来土地改革运动的成绩后，并指出运动中的缺陷，同时检讨发生缺陷的原因，除了对封建没落阶级的反动性估计不足外，主要是领导上走群众路线不够，不敢放手的将党的政策大胆交给群众，不会运用群众组织，以推动工作，还有些人对群众路线有歪曲的解释，认为走群众路线就是把工作任务推给群众，群众就会自然而然的正确的干起来，既不把党的政策在群众中作深入的启发，又不和群众在一起耐心地领导群众。走群众路线是为了发扬群众的积极性和创造性，是集中群众的积极面光明面，以克服群众的消极落后面，但有些人却将群众的落后总错认为是群众意见，因而脱离了群众，远远地落在群众的后边。今后必须首先克服这些糊涂观念，领导上必须正确的走群众路线。其次为了巩固农民的优势，就须普遍充分的将百分之九十以上人口的农民发动起来，就是要组织农民的大多数，因此今后领导上要面向落后村落后群众，发动落后村与人，这是较艰苦的工作，必须充分使用组织力量，更从实际出发，更耐心的工作。因此不能只靠我们脱离生产的少数干部去做，必须充分运用群众组织起来的力量，大胆的动员先进村发动落后村，动员积极分子发动落后分子，把百分之九十以上的农民组织到复查中。为此必须明确联合中农的政策，强调大村照顾小村，中贫农团结一道才能取得斗争的胜利。为了壮大农民的力量，必须在复查中注意发动妇女起来和农民一齐面向封建地主阶级作斗争。
