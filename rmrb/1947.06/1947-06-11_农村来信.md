Rural Letter

    This year's Spring Festival Yangko in Taihang. Each county proposed the cultural and entertainment policy of "liberated masses, singing and enjoying themselves," and combining with the work of the village to commend heroes and models. According to the summary materials of Xiangyuan, Licheng, Shexian, Zuoquan, Qixian, Cixian and other counties, and my own understanding below, this has been achieved in actual practice.
    What is particularly worth mentioning here is the Liming Drama Troupe of Licheng, which played a brilliant organizational and promoting role in this activity. Before the movement, they held a meeting and felt that every year during the Spring Festival, the masses performed plays, they also performed plays, mass groups competed, and they also participated in the competition. This caused many problems: First, it was separated from the mass cultural and entertainment activities, each doing its own thing, neither learning from the masses nor playing the due organizational and promoting role. Second, because they are a professional drama troupe, they naturally perform better than general amateur drama troupes, so every time the issue of whether or not to award them a prize always causes a debate. Based on this situation, they decided to put the work of the drama troupe aside temporarily and assign personnel to various districts and villages to focus on helping and cultivating village cultural and entertainment activities. However, because of the shortage of manpower and the inability to meet the demand, every village asked them for people, so they jointly studied with the Cultural and Education Section to determine the period before the end of the year as the script writing period, requiring each village to submit an outline of the content, story, and why to write the script they had determined to the county and district; those who wrote quickly would submit the script. They then studied these outlines and scripts one by one and put forward opinions. Generally speaking, these materials can be divided into two categories, one is to write about the facts of the village, and the other is imaginary. In terms of script writing methods, most only write a few lyrics, which is considered a script. After the research, the script writers of each village were convened, and it was pointed out that they should write according to the facts of the village, and some suggestions were also made on the structure; in addition, it was pointed out that when writing, they should not only write lyrics, but also write dialogues, scenery, characters, expressions, and actions. Where it is necessary to divide scenes, they were also told how to divide them, so that even if others have not seen the performance, they can see some clues from the script alone, so as not to not understand it. Sure enough, I read twenty or thirty of his scripts, and they were indeed very good, all above the general level. From the content of these scripts, most of them are about the struggle for liberation. According to my statistics of forty-seven copies drawn from Xiangyuan, nineteen are about liberation, such as "Landlord's Tricks," "Pouring Out Grievances," "Uniting Middle Peasants," and "Xu Yongchang's Liberation," ten are about current affairs (including supporting the front line), eight are about production, six are about supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers, three are about joining the army, and one is about marriage issues. And each one that does not directly reflect the struggle for liberation is also connected to liberation, so in general, they can all be said to be liberation dramas.
    In terms of form, the vast majority are plaza Yangko dramas; and they break through the general form of Yangko dramas, and have many new creations in the use of mass scenes, collective singing, Yangko dance team accompaniment, dance, and opera recitation. Here I will only introduce the script creation process of one village: After hearing about the Spring Festival entertainment, the cadres and masses of Yanzhi Village in Licheng discussed together what needs to be commended in the village? How to commend it? Everyone said: "The good thing about our village's oil mill should be commended." Then they proposed "What can we use to show our oil mill?" Some said: "Let's use a person to carry two buckets of oil while twisting and singing about our oil mill." Some said: "This is not good, it cannot show the production process of our oil mill, and cannot introduce the experience," but this is technically difficult. Finally, it was decided: "Use people to dress up, dress up like an oil press." It is said that they later developed from dressing up as an oil mill to using people to dress up as looms and spinning wheels, and performed together on the field. Look! Isn't this a good dance? A very good folk collective dance art? Unfortunately, I didn't see the performance, it's really a pity!……

　　农村来信
    夏青
    太行今年春节秧歌。各县都提出“翻身群众、自唱自乐”，和结合本村工作表扬英雄模范的文娱方针。根据襄垣、黎城、涉县、左权、祁县、磁县等县的总结材料和我亲自在下面的了解，在实际进行中，都做到了。
    这里特别值得提出的是黎城黎明剧团，他们在这次活动中起了辉煌地组织、推动作用。运动前，他们开了一个会，感到去过每年春节，群众演戏，他们也演戏，群众团体竞赛，他们也参加竞赛，这样便出了很多毛病：第一与群众文娱活动脱节，各搞各的，既不能向群众学习，又起不了应有的组织，推动作用。第二因为他们是职业剧团，自然比一般业余剧团要演的好一些，于是每次关于给不给他们发奖的问题，总要引起一番争论。根据这样的情况，他们便决定把剧团工作暂时放一下，把人员分配到各区、村去，有重点地帮助和培养村的文娱活动。但因人手不够，供不应求，村村都向他们要人，所以又与文教科共同研究，确定年关前为编剧时期，要各村把他们确定好的剧本内容，故事，及为何写，写一个提纲，交到县、区上来；有编得快的，就交剧本。他们再根据这些提纲、剧本逐个研究，提出意见。一般地说这些材料可分为两类，一类是写本村的事实，一类是空想的。在编剧的方法上，多半只写几段唱词，就算是一个剧本。研究好了，便召集各村编写人，指出应根据本村的事实写，结构上也提了些意见；另外又指出写时不要光写唱词，要把道白、布景、人物、表情、动作都写上。需要分场的地方，也告诉了他们如何分，这样别人就是没有看到演出，单看剧本也可以看出些名堂来，不致看不懂。果然，我看了他二、三十本剧本，的确很不坏，都在一般水平之上。从这些剧本的内容，多数是写翻身斗争，根据我在襄垣抽出四十七本的统计，写翻身的有十九本，如“地主手腕”、“倒苦水”、“团结中农”、“徐永昌翻身”等，时事的（包括支援前线）有十本，生产的有八本，拥军优抗的六本，参军的三本婚姻问题一本。而每个不是直接反映翻身斗争的，又都连系了翻身，所以总的说来都可以说是翻身剧。
    形式方面绝大多数是广场秧歌剧；并且突破一般秧歌剧的形式，在利用群众场面，集体歌唱，秧歌舞队的伴唱，舞蹈，和歌剧的朗诵各方面，都有很多新的创造。这里我仅介绍一个村的剧本创作过程：黎城胭脂村在听到迎春节娱乐以后，干部、群众便一起商量，本村有些甚需要表扬的？如何表扬？大家说：“咱村油坊的好应该表扬。”，接着提出“咱用个甚能把咱油坊表现出来”？有的说：“咱用一个人挑两桶油边扭边唱咱油坊”。有的说：“这样不好，不能表现咱油坊的生产过程，介绍不出经验，“但这样做技术上很困难，最后决定：“用人来扮，扮成榨油机一样”。据说他们后来又由扮油坊发展到用人扮织布机、纺车，一起在场子上演起来，你看！这不是很好的舞蹈吗？一个很好的民间的集体舞蹈艺术吗？可惜我没有看到演出，真是恨事！…………。
