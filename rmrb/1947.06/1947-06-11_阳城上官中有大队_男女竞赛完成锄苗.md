　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch】The Shangguan Middle Joint Brigade in Yancheng, Yanshan has largely completed weeding. The brigade started weeding on the 29th of last month. It has 198 male full laborers, 49 children and old men, and 140 women. In seven days, they have weeded approximately 1227 mu of early autumn crops, averaging 0.553 mu per worker per day. The Shangguan Guoyuan group of the Third Detachment was the first to organize a competition, weeding 0.6 mu per worker per day. Stimulated by the Guoyuan group, the Li Xiuhua group also competed with them, weeding up to 0.712 mu per worker per day. The Lujiahe Seventh Detachment, due to reasonable work evaluation and scoring, fully utilized the power of semi-laborers, improving labor efficiency, averaging 0.737 mu per worker per day, breaking the highest record of the Joint Brigade. In particular, the women of Lujiahe have become the main force in weeding. Lu Xiaoduo alone can weed 0.8 mu of grain per day. Li Xiaohua is a military family member, she refused the preferential treatment from the villagers. In addition to weeding her own 4.7 mu of grain, she also had extra work capacity. The Jide Brigade lacked labor, so they started early, organizing all labor to the fields, a total of 359 people. It is expected that in half a month, the entire village's 1837.6 mu of grain will be weeded. Other brigades can complete the work in one or two days. The reason for the unprecedentedly intense and rapid weeding of the Joint Brigade this time is the mutual competition between cadres seeking merit and the masses; for example, Shangguan Zirong and others, who were usually backward members of the Yanshan Brigade, still advocated "slow work" in the first few days of weeding, but seeing that the cadres and everyone else had started a competition, they worked hard invisibly. The Shangguan Luxi group, which was the most disorganized group in the entire brigade, also bravely proposed a competition with other groups this time.

　　阳城上官中有大队
    男女竞赛完成锄苗
    【本报太岳九日电】阳城岩山上官中有联合大队，大部完成锄苗。该大队于上月二十九日开始锄苗，计男全劳力一百九十八人，儿童、老汉四十九人，妇女一百四十人，七天中已约一千二百廿七亩早秋全部锄完，平均每个工每天锄苗五分五厘三。三分队上官国元小组最先组织竞赛，每工每日锄六分，李秀华组在国元小组的刺激下，亦与其竞赛，每工每天锄至七分一厘二。芦家河七分队由于评工记分合理，充分发挥了半劳力的力量，劳动效率提高，平均每工每天锄苗七分三厘七，打破了联合大队的最高纪录。特别是芦家河的妇女，成为锄苗中的主力。芦小多一人每天能锄八分谷。李小花是个军属，她拒绝了村人的优待，除将自己的四亩七分谷锄完外，并有余工。吉德大队劳力缺乏，便提早下手，组织了所有劳力上地，共三百五十九人，预计半个月即可将全村一千八百三十七亩六分谷子锄完。其他大队一二日皆可完成。该联合大队此次锄苗空前紧张、迅速，其原因是干部立功与群众间的互相竞赛；如岩山大队素日落后的队员上官自荣等，在锄苗的前几日还是主张“消停干”，但看见干部与大家都展开了竞赛，无形中亦干起来，上官芦喜小组，是全大队最散漫的一组，此次亦勇于向其他小组提出竞赛。
