　　[Benbao Jinan Fifteenth Electric] The newly liberated area of Zhangnan, Chu Wang Town, has launched a fierce counter-liquidation struggle against traitors and local tyrant landlords, and has distributed 600 mu of wheat fields to the masses, realizing the plan of dividing the land before the wheat harvest. The work experience has shown that in areas where enemy puppets and local tyrant landlords have ruled for a long time, the government's strong support for the masses is a crucial key to mobilizing the masses. Song Liangzhan, a landlord in Dongjie, colluded with the enemy and committed evil deeds. At first, the masses did not dare to mention it. After the district cadres helped the masses detain him first, the masses revealed his crimes of colluding with the enemy. Secondly, the cadres leading the emancipation should carry forward the spirit of being bold and daring, quickly enter into a large-scale movement, and grasp the most urgent demands of the masses. For example, in Xijie, the landlords were detained on the first day, and the wheat fields were investigated and cleared on the second day, because this was a problem that the masses of the town were eager to solve. The enthusiasm of the masses immediately rose. Thirdly, it is necessary to suppress evil forces and defeat the puppet regime. The puppet Bao chiefs of the four streets of Chu Wang were the ruling foundation of the enemy and the "lackeys" of the feudal landlords and local tyrants. Under such circumstances, we must first support the masses and eliminate the worst puppet personnel. Dongjie also carried out a mass "digging up the electric wires" movement (of the landlord's lackeys), suppressed the evil forces, and established righteousness.

　　楚旺反倒算胜利收回麦田六百亩
    【本报冀南十五日电】漳南新区楚旺镇已向汉奸、恶霸地主开展激烈反倒算斗争，且将麦田六百亩分给群众，实现了麦前分完麦地的计划。工作中体验到在敌伪、恶霸地主统治已久之地区，政府大力给群众撑腰是发动群众的重要关键。东街地主宋良展通敌作恶，开始群众都不敢提，经区干部帮助群众先将其扣押，群众才诉出他通敌的罪恶事实。其次领导翻身的干部要发扬大胆放手、敢作敢为的精神，很快进入大动，掌握群众最急迫的要求。如西街第一天扣起地主，第二天就进行清查麦田，因为这是全镇群众急待解决的问题。群众情绪马上就高了起来。再次要镇压邪气打垮伪政权，楚旺四街的伪保长，都是敌人在时的统治基础，是封建地主恶霸的“狗腿”，在这种情况下，首先扶持群众，打掉最坏的伪人员。东街并进行了群众性的“刨电线”运动，（地主狗腿）镇压了邪气，树立了正气。
