　　[This newspaper's Ji, Lu, Yu dispatch of the 24th] Locust nymphs have been discovered in Nanle, and the democratic government is organizing the masses to intensify the effort to eliminate them. Locust nymphs were discovered in seven villages around Yanzhuang and Xiaotun in the first district of the county. The locust nymphs mostly grow in wheat fields, covering an area of ​​more than 40 hectares. After the wheat harvest, the locust nymphs concentrated in the autumn seedling fields, and some have been eaten by more than half. After hearing the news, the county immediately held a meeting to study and decided to immediately establish a temporary locust catching headquarters in the mountain villages. The district convened a meeting of village cadres from 20 villages to study how to organize forces. After the meeting, the masses in each village conducted emergency mobilization. All people over the age of ten and under the age of fifty-five, regardless of gender, must participate in locust catching. On the 7th of this month, more than 4,000 people gathered in Yanzhuang after breakfast to catch and beat the locusts. The masses in Zhangzhuang said: "In the past, poor people had no land, and they had to catch locusts for the landlords. Now the land is our own, we must do a good job of catching them." By six o'clock in the evening, the locusts had been completely eliminated. County Chief Hu also instructed all villages to send special personnel to conduct regular inspections. If any are found, regardless of the circumstances, they should report to the higher authorities and immediately organize forces to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate them. A large number of locust nymphs have also been discovered in the eastern part of the second district, around Lvcun, Liangcun, and Xijie villages. Some have eaten up all the sorghum seedlings, and forces are now being organized to eliminate them.

　　南乐大力捕蝗
    【本报冀鲁豫廿四日电】南乐发现蝗蝻，民主政府正组织群众加紧痛打。该县一区烟庄、小屯一带七个村庄发现蝗蝻，蝗蝻多生长在麦地里，面积约有四十余顷，麦收之后，蝗蝻集中到秋苗地里，有的已被吃去大半。县里闻讯后当即开会研究决定马上成立山村临时捕蝗指挥部，区里召集了二十个村的村干会议，研究如何组织力量。会后各村群众进行紧急动员，凡年在十岁以上五十五岁以下者不论男女，均需参加捕蝗。本月七日早饭后集合到烟庄，有四千余人，捕打，张庄的群众说：“过去穷人没有地，打蚂蚱都是给地主打，现在地是咱自己的啦，咱一定要好好的打。”晚上六点钟已把蚂蚱打的干干净净。胡县长又指示各村应派专人经常检查，如发现后，不论任何情况，要一面向上级报告，一面赶紧组织力量，坚决彻底消灭之。二区东部吕村、梁村、西杰村一带亦发现大批蝗蝻，有的已把高粱苗吃光，现正组织力量消灭中。
