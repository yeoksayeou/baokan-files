Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 1st:

　　Visiting Brigade Commander Chen Xuyun
    On the 22nd at noon, this reporter met Chen Xuyun, the captured Kuomintang army's 74th Division, 57th Brigade Brigadier General, during the Battle of Menglianggu.

    In a square farmhouse hall, Chen Xuyun was sleeping on a large bed against the south wall. He had a shoulder wound on his left side, but no broken bones. An American military cap was pushed back on his forehead, and his thin face showed the pain of his injury. When the reporter looked at his wound, he leaned forward, closed his eyes, and repeatedly sighed. He stretched out his right hand from the gray military blanket and repeatedly traced the words "no value" on his chest, his face slightly red with shame.

    When the reporter asked him about the Battle of Menglianggu, he shook his head again and again. After a moment of calm, he said in a low voice, "Entering the Liberated Area is like being in a desperate situation. There was no water or firewood on Mount Menglianggu, and not a single civilian. The conditions for combat were too bad."

    "The terrain of Menglianggu is defensible," the reporter reminded him.

    "It was too late. My brigade had just reached the mountainside, and the troops didn't have time to spread out before they were forced to fight. Your army's (referring to the People's Liberation Army) artillery fire was unexpectedly fierce and accurate. I saw that most of the regimental and battalion commanders under my command were wounded, the soldiers had no cover, and even flying stones could hit people. Mountain warfare was too unfavorable."

    After thinking for a while with his eyes closed, he continued, "Chief Chen (Chen Cheng) commanded too inflexibly. The troops walked into traps like blind men and still had to advance at risk. Subordinates can only obey orders."

    After lunch, Chen Xuyun hoped to meet Li Yan, the Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang army's 73rd Army who was captured in the Laiwu Campaign, as soon as possible. He requested to be reissued clothes on the registration form. These experienced performances showed that he was undoubtedly confident in the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army.

    The topic turned to the rumor company, the Central News Agency.

    "How do you feel about the Central News Agency's propaganda that 'the Communist army was annihilated 17 brigades in Linyi'?"

    "That's a loud fart!" Chen Xuyun seemed a little indignant.

    "Do you think the war will end?"

    "It will end soon."

    "Why?"

    "There are not many troops capable of fighting left, and even fewer people are willing to fight a civil war."

    Chen shook his head again. "Defeated general," he suddenly blurted out these four words. When he realized his slip of the tongue, he leaned against the wall, closed his eyes, and pondered for a long time, unable to think of a suitable word.

　　访陈嘘云旅长
    二十二日中午，记者会见孟良崮之战就俘的蒋军七十四师五十七旅少将旅长陈嘘云。
    在一间方方的农家堂屋里，南面靠墙的大床上，正睡着陈嘘云。左肩负伤，但未伤骨。美式军帽横在眉毛上，瘦长的面孔，显出伤后的痛苦样子。当记者看他伤口时，他欠身合目，连连摇头叹气。从灰色的军毡里伸出右手来，在自己的胸口连划着“无代价”三个字，脸色因羞愧而微红。
    记者问他孟良崮作战经过，他又连摇着头。在一度镇静之后，低声说：“进入解放区，就象身临绝地。孟良崮山上无水无柴，没有一个老百姓。作战的条件太坏了。”
    “孟良崮的地形是可以坚守的呢。”记者提醒他。
    “来不及了。我的旅刚跑到山腰，队伍来不及展开，就被迫应战了。贵军（指人民解放军）炮火出乎意料的猛烈和准确。我看见部下的团营长多数负伤，士兵没有掩体，石子飞起来也打人，山地作战太不利了。”
    他在闭目细思了一番后，继续说：“陈总长（陈诚）指挥太不灵活了。部队象瞎子一样走到陷阱里，还要冒险前进。当下级的只有服从命令。”
    午饭后，陈嘘云希望及早能晤见莱芜战役中就俘的蒋军七十三军副军长李琰。他在登记表上要求能补发衣服。这些老练的表现，说明了他对解放军的宽大政策是确信无疑的。
    话题转到了谣言公司中央社。
    “你对于中央社‘共军在临沂被歼灭十七个旅’的宣传感觉如何？”
    “那是放大屁！”陈嘘云好象有些愤激了。
    “你以为战争会结束吗？”
    “会很快结束的。”
    “为什么？”
    “能打仗的队伍不多了，愿意打内战的人更少。”
    陈又一次摇起头来。“败兵之将”，他忽然吐出这四个字。当他感觉失言时，他依墙闭目苦思，半天也想不出一句合适的话来。（新华社山东一日电）
