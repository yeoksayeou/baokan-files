　　Shuatou Village Selects Sowing and War Effort Heroes
　　Boosting Mass Production Enthusiasm
　　[This newspaper's Heshun news] Shuatou Village summarized the selection of heroes for participating in the war effort and sowing. After the return of the village's war participants on the 14th of last month, the entire village completed sowing. To encourage the emotions of those participating in the war, the liberated hero Li Baohai first organized the war participants to personally inspect the fields of each household. That evening, a village-wide mass get-together was held to celebrate the victories of both the front and rear, summarizing and selecting models from both the front and rear. Those who participated in the war talked about the victories at the front, while those at home talked about how to complete the sowing ahead of schedule despite the labor shortage. Zhang Yuhuang, a militia member who participated in the war, said: "Our Eighth Route Army is really capable, destroying a blockhouse with a single shot. You really haven't seen it, there are so many cannons, they fill up Yangquan." The masses were celebrating noisily, and the children jumped and shouted slogans celebrating the great victory of the front and rear. Then, the liberated hero Li Baohai sought the opinions of the war participants on the sowing, asking what had not been done well enough. The director of the armed committee said: "In the past, when everyone was at home, they still couldn't finish planting. This year, out of the village's seventy-two laborers, forty-two participated in the war, and we still planted ten days earlier than last year. If we hadn't planted early, would the seedlings have survived this drought? We looked and there wasn't a single missing seedling." Ji Jincheng, a liberated old farmer, said: "If you want to do well, you always need leadership. Baohai is really a lamp guiding us to get rich." Everyone applauded and cheered again. When things quieted down, Baohai proposed: "Both the front and rear have done so well, there must be model leaders who should be commended and recorded in the merit book." After group deliberations, it was reported to the general meeting. Zhang Fuyuan, a family member of a soldier, said: "I personally sent my son to join the army. Not only did my family not need substitute farming, but I also volunteered to help the war participants sow twenty-five mu of land. I want to be recognized for my merit." Ji Jincheng said: "I participated in a mutual aid group spinning rope for three months and earned a donkey." The child Li Guisuo said: "I led the children to dig up one hundred jin of medicinal herbs, plow one hundred mu of stubble, and dig thirty-two pits, increasing fertilizer by eight hundred dan. I want to be recognized for my merit." After a period of free discussion, some said that planting two days early should be considered meritorious, some said that the children's achievements were great and should be recognized, and some said that Baohai's leadership was good and should be recognized. After a while of discussion, eight models were elected by a show of hands, including two middle peasants and six poor and hired peasants, one war effort model, one model cadre, two women labor models, one model mutual aid group leader, and three production and wealth-building models. Everyone celebrated and praised them. The model cadre Li Baohai, with a smile on his face, said to everyone: "My becoming a hero and model is also the achievement of everyone. If everyone is not active, I cannot become a model." Everyone happily said: "In the future, we should work harder, everyone makes contributions, and everyone gets rich." Each group then set a seven-day weeding plan. Due to the commendation and selection of models, everyone's enthusiasm was very high. The seven-day plan was completed in six days, and two hundred mu of weeds were also pulled from the valley fields, and twenty-five laborers were squeezed out for transportation. (Guilin, Shuanlin)

    【本报和顺讯】梳头村总结参战下种评选英雄。该村参战人员上月十四日返回后，全村已完成下种。翻身英雄李保孩为了鼓励参战者的情绪，先组织参战的亲自到各家地里检查，当日晚上，已开了全村群众联欢会，庆祝前后方胜利，总结评选前后方模范。参战的谈前方胜利，在家的谈劳力缺乏怎样提前完成下种。参战民兵张玉黄说：咱八路军真能干，一炮打一个炮楼子，你们真没见过，大炮可多哩，把阳泉给堆满了。”群众在狂欢着的吵闹着，儿童们跳跃着高呼出庆祝前方后方大胜利等口号。接着翻身英雄李保孩征求参战人对下种的意见，有那些做的不够，武委会主任说：“过去都在家时到现在还种不进哩，今年全村七十二个劳力参战走了四十二个，还比去年早种了十来天，不是种的早时，这天旱的还能够苗了？我们看了一下没有一块缺苗的。”翻身老农记近成说：“要想闹的好，总得有领导，”保孩真是领导咱们发财的一盏灯。大家又是一阵鼓掌与欢呼。静下来时保孩提出：前后方都干的这样好，一定有模范带头还要评功，上功劳簿。经小组酝酿后，到大会上报，抗属张福员说：“我亲自送儿参了军，家中不但不用代耕，我还自愿帮助参战的下了二十五亩种啦，我要立功。”记近成说：“我参加互助纺绳子三个月赚了一头驴”。儿童李贵锁说：“我领导儿童们刨了药材一百斤，刨茬一百亩，打坑三十二个，增加肥料八百担，我要立功”。经一阵自由酝让后，有的说早种二天那也算立功，有的儿童成绩大该立功，有的说保孩领导好该立功。大家讨论了一会后，用拳头选举出八个模范，其中中农二个，贫雇六个，参战模范一个，模范干部一个，妇女劳动模范二个，模范互助组长一个，生产发家模范三个，大家狂欢着称赞，而模范干部李保孩脸带笑容向大家说：“我当英雄模范也是大家的功绩，大家不积极我也当不了模范”。大家都欢喜的说：“今后还应更努力，大家立功大家发财”。各组接着订出七天的锄苗计划。由于表功选模，大家情绪很高，七天计划在六天内就完成了，还拔了谷地草二百亩，并挤出二十五个劳力运输。（桂林、拴林）
