　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th. TASS, New York: Former Vice President Wallace delivered a speech at a conference hosted by the "New Jersey Independent Citizens Committee." He said: He would organize a struggle to resist "warmongers and creators of economic depression, who believe that war is inevitable and lead people's minds to hatred and fear in order to create economic depression." Wallace criticized the Truman Doctrine, saying: Throughout the world, the United States is increasingly supporting reactionaries against the general public, and as a result, the general public is increasingly "relying on the ideals, help, and encouragement of the Soviet Union." He also said: At present, the vast majority of people in most countries generally believe that the United States is the center of world reaction. The United States is respected for its strength, but it is feared for the way it uses its strength. Wallace warned that the people of the European resistance movement would not support a war against the Soviet Union. He pointed out that the reactionaries in the United States and elsewhere are less frightened by communism than by democracy, and the proposal to conscript troops in the United States during peacetime constitutes the tip of "militarism" and the dictatorship of large enterprises, and betrays American traditions. Wallace criticized Vandenberg and Hoover's proposals to conclude a separate peace treaty with Germany, and said: "The United States must work with the Soviet Union to explore the needs of the people of the world and prepare together to meet their needs. This includes the needs of the Soviet Union, which suffered the most in the anti-fascist war."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th. TASS, New York: According to newspaper reports, former Vice President Wallace recently delivered a speech to 6,000 listeners in Montgomery, Alabama, in which he opposed the suggestions made by Hoover and Vandenberg to conclude separate peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Wallace said that international peace requires a deep mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States. Regarding the proposal to implement universal military training for American youth, he called it "one of the products of the Truman Doctrine" and opposed the "military education" of young people. Wallace predicted that military training and maintaining military delegations abroad would cost 20 billion US dollars annually, and he believed that this would lead the United States to an economic depression more severe than that of 1933. Wallace advocated that these funds could be better used to promote international trade for the benefit of the people and to educate American youth in "peacetime professions that are dedicated to saving lives rather than destroying them."
    Also, according to American newspaper reports, sixty professors and faculty members from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, sent a letter to former Vice President Wallace proposing the creation of a third political party, "which will force democracy to be more effectively implemented domestically and assist in solving the urgent problem of the United Nations' broad global cooperation." The letter stated: "Only in this way can the reactionary trends in the United States be stopped." The letter also praised Wallace for bravely telling the American people: "In international affairs, we [note: referring to the US authorities] have adopted a dangerous political course that is leading to bankruptcy."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. TASS, New York, 8th: According to reports, former US Vice President Wallace delivered a speech at a mass meeting hosted by the "Southern Human Welfare Conference" in Durham, North Carolina. He declared that the authorities in the United States are embarking on a "path of suicide" by cooperating or preparing to cooperate with reactionaries in almost every country in the world. He said: "We have divided the unity between the major political parties in France and Italy through acquiescence or bribery, and have given support to the most undemocratic or unpopular forces in both countries." Wallace commented on the major events of the past week, pointing out that prominent groups in the United States are suffering from hysteria, urging the passage of legislation to carry out universal military training at an annual cost of approximately 20 billion yuan. Secretary of State Marshall requested that Congress authorize the President to dispatch American military delegations to any country in peacetime to help train armies "to maintain domestic stability." Senator Vandenberg supported Hoover and declared that unless the Soviet Union adopted Vandenberg's point of view, the United States would conclude separate peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Truman asked Congress to authorize the arming of all the republics of the Americas. The Truman Doctrine provides any country with the resources of the United States for those forces that have shown themselves to be anti-Soviet or guaranteed to be anti-Soviet. This doctrine is the greatest example of non-productive expenditure of material and human resources - second only to the war we participated in. Wallace condemned the leadership of the United States government, saying that it lacked trust in the people, so it hysterically advocated using force abroad to oppose an idea and carrying out intimidation at home.

　　华莱士连续发表演说
    斥责战争贩子
    反对美与德奥单独订立和约指出美国正走上自杀的道路
    【新华社陕北十五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：前副总统华莱士在“新泽西独立公民委员会”所主持之大会上发表演说。他说：他要组织斗争以反抗“战争贩子及经济萧条的制造者，他们相信战争是不可避免的，而且把人们的思想引向憎恨与恐惧以制造经济萧条”。华莱士抨击杜鲁门主义称：在全世界内美国日益支持反动派反对一般人民，而因此一般人民也日益“仰赖苏联的理想、帮助与鼓励”。他又称：现时最大多数国家的人民普遍的都认为美国是世界反动的中心，美国以其力量受人尊重，但是以其利用力量的方法使人恐惧。华莱士警告谓：欧洲抵抗运动的人们，不会支持战争去反对苏联。他指出：美国及其他地方的反动派们与其说是被共产主义所惊恐，勿宁说是被民主所惊恐，而和平时期在美国征兵的提案，就构成“军国主义”的及大企业的独裁之尖端，并且背弃了美国的传统。华莱士抨击范登堡及胡佛关于单独与德国缔结和约的提议，并说：“美国必须与苏联共同探求世界人民的需要，并一道准备去满足他们的需要。这其中包括着苏联的需要，她在反法西斯主义的战争中受难最深。”
    【新华社陕北十三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：据报纸报导：前副总统华莱士顷阿拉巴麻州蒙特哥美利城向六千听众发表演说，他反对佛与范登堡所提出的单独与德奥订立和约的建议。华莱士称：国际间的和平需要苏美间之深切的互相谅解。关于美国青年施行普遍军训之建议，他称之为：“杜鲁门主义的产物之一”，他反对青年的“军事教育”。华氏预告称：为军事训练和维持国外的军事代表团，每年将耗费二十万万美元，而且彼相信这将把美国引致比一九三三年更严重的经济萧条。华氏主张这些资金可以更好的用来为了老百姓的利益促进国际贸易，并教育美国青年“热心服务目的在于拯救生命而不是在毁灭生命的和平时期的职业。”
    又讯：据美国报纸报导：伊理诺斯州厄凡斯吞城的西北大学六十位教授与教员致函前副总统华莱士，提议创立第三政党，“此政党在国内将迫使民主得以更有效的实行，并协助解决紧要的联合国的世界广泛合作问题。”该信称：“只有在这种方式下才能制止美国国内的反动趋向。”该信并赞扬华莱士勇敢地告诉了美国人们：“在国际问题中我们（按：指美国当局）采取了正引向破产的危险政治路线。”
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社纽约八日电：据报载，前美副总统华莱士在北卡罗里纳州之的里城“南部人类福利会议”主持之群众大会上发表演说。他宣称：美国的当权者们正在经由和世界上几乎是每一国家内反动分子的合作或者准备合作，走上“自杀的道路”。他说：“我们用默许或者贿赂分裂了法意两国各大政党间的团结，并且已经给了两国内最不民主或最不受众望的力量以支持。”华莱士评述过去一周大事，指出：美国的显要集团患了歇斯底里亚，敦促通过每年花费约二十万万元去进行普遍军训的立法案。国务卿马歇尔请求国会授权总统得于和平时期派遣美国军事代表团至任何国家，帮助训练“维持其国内安定”之军队。参议员范登堡支持胡佛，并且声言除非苏联采取范登堡的观点，美国将对德奥单独缔结和约。杜鲁门要求国会授权武装美洲所有的共和国，杜鲁门主义供给任何国家内那些表明了反苏或者以反苏作保证的势力，利用美国的富源。这个主义是不生产地花费物力人力的最大的例子——仅次于我们曾经参加过的战争。华莱士谴责美国政府的领导，说它缺少对于人民的信任，所以歇斯底里地主张在国外用武力去反对一种思想，并在国内进行恫吓。
