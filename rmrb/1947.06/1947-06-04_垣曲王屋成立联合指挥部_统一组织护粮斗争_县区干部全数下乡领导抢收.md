　　The Yuanqu and Wangwu counties have organized a joint command headquarters to unify the command of the grain protection and wheat safeguarding struggle in both counties. In Yuanqu County, all district cadres, except for one who remained to maintain the work of the organization, have gone to the countryside to lead the rush harvest. According to the different wheat harvesting seasons in the mountains and plains, the command headquarters specifically extracted more than 180 strong farmers from the mountains to form three rush harvest teams, cooperating with the armed rush harvest team composed of over 100 militiamen, and went to the riverine areas on the 17th to assist the masses in the plains to rush harvest. Wangwu renamed the county's militia rotation teams as "Production Guerrilla Teams" and divided them into two lines of activity; the first line of militiamen has quickly arrived at the Zhengjia Village area, more than ten li away from Yuanqu County, and the second line of militiamen has also developed southward to the Wangjiazhi area. On the 19th and 20th, more than 200 Chiang Kai-shek troops raided the Lijia Geda area, but were all repelled by the militiamen. The militiamen covered the masses in the area to rush harvest more than 400 mu, without any loss. At present, the county's barley has been completely harvested; wheat, rapeseed, and other crops are also being rushed.

Xinhua News Agency, Ji-Lu-Yu, 1st: In Juye, land reform was implemented during the guerrilla warfare, and the liberated peasants' production enthusiasm has soared to unprecedented levels, and they have organized militias and rotation shifts for armed guarding of the crops. Farmers in villages such as Zhanglouxi Township in the Dayi District have put forward slogans such as "Defend the harvested wheat," and young people have shouldered knives and guns, patrolling the wheat fields day and night to prevent Chiang Kai-shek's troops from seizing grain.

Taihang Fourth Special District Organizations All Participate in Assisting the Harvest
This newspaper, Taihang News: The Fourth Special Commissioner's Office held a meeting on May 22 with the resident organizations, public security offices, industry and commerce bureaus, banks, and resident village cadres. After the Finance and Grain Section Chief Li proposed the importance of defending the wheat harvest, all comrades launched a heated discussion and decided on the following measures: 1. In addition to individual cadres staying to maintain work, all organizations will be organized into groups and teams to participate in assisting the harvest. 2. Give priority to harvesting for military families, cadre families, and the orphaned and widowed, and then help the general public. 3. Village cadres should immediately start registering the amount of wheat fields for military families, cadre families, and the orphaned and widowed, as well as the ripening time, in order to allocate the work. 4. In assisting the harvest, we must carry out the movement to perform meritorious service for the people, and launch competitions between individuals and groups. The conditions are: fast harvesting, no loss of wheat, no breaking the sickle, able to help others, and good mass relations. At the end of the assistance, we must summarize and elect models. After the meeting, the Special Commissioner's Office first organized itself, and 28 people voluntarily formed four groups. They have prepared furniture and will immediately participate once the wheat ripens. The investigation work has now been completed in the village, and they are only waiting for the wheat to ripen in three to five days before all members go into action. (Zhi Peng)

This newspaper, Qinyang News: The Qinyang County Government has decided to organize a propaganda team of senior elementary school teachers and students to go to the guerrilla areas to work during the half-month wheat holiday to defend the wheat harvest and carry out political offensives. The team was established on May 23, with twenty senior elementary school staff and students participating. The entire team is divided into three groups, with one group in each district. The main method of work is to seize the gaps in actually helping the masses harvest wheat to carry out propaganda, and organize the masses to rush harvest, so as to achieve the goal of not letting the enemy seize a single grain of wheat. The propaganda team members are all full of energy and high spirits, determined to perform meritorious service for the people. Led by the Director of Education Section, Jiao Qi, they set off on the 24th of last month. (Zhi Peng)

    统一组织护粮斗争
    县区干部全数下乡领导抢收
    【本报太岳一日电】垣曲、王屋两县组织联合指挥部，统一指挥两县护粮、保麦斗争。垣曲县区干部除留一人坚持机关工作外，其余全数下乡领导抢收。指挥部根据山上山下麦收季节迟早不同，特由山上抽出一百八十余壮健农民组成三个抢收队，配合由百余民兵组成的武装抢收队，于十七日分赴沿河一带援助山下群众抢收。王屋把全县民兵轮战队命名为“生产游击队”，分成二线活动；第一线民兵已速至距垣曲县城十余里之郑家村一带，第二线民兵亦已向南发展至王家峙一带。十九、廿两日蒋伪二百余人向李家疙瘩一带扰袭，均为民兵击退。民兵掩护该地群众抢收四百余亩，颗粒无损，刻全县大麦已收割完毕；小麦，油菜等也正在抢收中。
    【新华社冀鲁豫一日电】巨野在游击战争中实行了土地改革，翻身农民生产情绪空前高涨，纷纷组织民兵、轮班武装看青。大义区张楼奚乡等村农民提出：“保卫已收回的麦子”等口号，青壮年扛起刀枪，昼夜巡守麦地，防止蒋伪抢粮。
        太行四专机关全部参加助收
    【本报太行讯】四专署于五月二十二日召开驻地各机关公安处、工商局、银行和驻村干部会议，经财粮科栗科长提出保卫麦收的重要后，全体同志展开热烈讨论，定出以下几个办法：１、各机关除留个别干部坚持工作外，全部组织成小组、队分别参加助收。２、首先给军属、干属、孤寡收割，然后再帮助一般群众。３、村干部马上着手登记军属、干属、孤寡等麦地数目，成熟时间，以便分工收割。４、在助收中要开展为民立功运动，人与人、组与组展开竞赛，条件是：割的快，不丢麦，不坏镰，能帮助别人，群众关系好，到助收结束时要进行总结评选模范。会后，专署首先组织起来，二十八人自愿结合为四组，已准备好家具，一俟麦子成熟立即参加，村内现已将调查工作完成，只等三、五日麦熟全体出动。（志鹏）
