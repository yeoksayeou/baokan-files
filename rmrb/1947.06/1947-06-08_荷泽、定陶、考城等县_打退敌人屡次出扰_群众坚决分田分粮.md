　　Heze, Dingtao, Kaocheng and other counties
    Repelled enemy intrusions many times
    The masses resolutely divided land and grain
    [Report from this newspaper, Jiluyu, 5th] The land reform in Heze, Dingtao, Kaocheng and other counties in southwestern Shandong has achieved remarkable results in the guerrilla war. Heze County has broken the misconception that "the masses in the enemy's rear guerrilla areas dare not ask for land" in practical actions. Whenever they arrived at a village, they would say to the masses: "We are here to divide the land! We will fight when the enemy comes." The government resolutely supported the masses, and whoever sabotaged it would be knocked down. The masses broke their worries, and the situation was quickly opened up in various villages. Currently, more than 50 villages have carried out land reform. The ×× village, which is twelve miles away from Dingtao city, is also enthusiastically dividing land and grain. Since the beginning of April, various districts in Fucheng have been actively promoting land reform. A cadre in the first district said: "To divide land for the masses, even if we are physically tired, our eyes are strained, and our legs are broken, we must strive to be a model." Although the enemy frequently harassed Suji Qinggujiji in our first and fifth districts, they still resolutely continued. The first district distributed the floating wealth between April 12th and 14th, the mass organizations were restored and expanded, and all the middle peasants participated in the distribution of floating wealth. The masses have taken up weapons and established a command. The Gaoxinzhuang neighborhood in the fifth district struggled against more than 20 landlords in one day. Now most of the floating wealth in the county is complete, and land is continuing to be divided. After reviewing the past piecemeal approach, Dingtao carried out tunnel construction on the one hand and land reform on the other. The masses were most afraid of "three-in-one soil" (landlords, bad guys, plus the "unlucky" army), and the leadership fully used administrative power to suppress the landlords and break the masses' worries. On April 11th, the government detained the landlords in a certain village and seized more than 4,000 catties of grain and more than 180 pieces of furniture. After the masses from other villages visited, the whole county was a sensation. Kaocheng first held a training class for activists. More than 500 county and district cadres and activists solemnly stated their attitudes. Now the movement to divide land and grain has been launched everywhere.

　　荷泽、定陶、考城等县
    打退敌人屡次出扰
    群众坚决分田分粮
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】鲁西南荷泽、定陶、考城等县在游击战争中进行土地改革成绩卓著。荷泽县已在实际行动中打破了“敌后游击区群众不敢要地”的错误想法。他们每到一村见了群众就说：“我们是来分地的！敌人来了就打。”政府坚决给群众撑腰，谁破坏就敲谁。群众打破了顾虑，各村迅速打开了局面，目下已有五十多村进行了土地改革。离定陶城十二里的××村，也热烈的分地分粮。复程自四月初起，各区均积极推行土地改革，一区干部说：“为群众分田，那怕身体累病、眼熬烂、腿跑折也得争取当模范。”敌人虽经常向我一、五区苏集青固集出扰，但仍坚决进行。一区在四月十二到十四三日内把浮财分完，群众组织恢复与扩大了，中农全部参加了分浮财。群众已拿起武器，建立了指挥部。五区高辛庄小区一天斗争了二十多个地主，现在全县浮财大部分完，正继续分地。定陶检讨了过去零打碎敲的做法后，一方面进行地道建设，一方面搞土地改革。群众最怕“三合土”（地主、坏蛋加“遭殃”军），领导上即充分运用行政力量，镇压地主，打破群众顾虑。四月十一日，政府在某庄扣押了地主，搜出地主四千多斤粮食，一百八十多件家具。外村群众参观后，全县就轰动起来。考城首先召开积极分子训练班，县区干部与积极分子五百余人均严肃表明自己的态度，现分地分粮运动已到处展开。
