Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 19th: A certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army has made new creations in propaganda and mobilization work and battle evaluation during the Stone Village Outskirts and Zhengtai Campaigns. (1) Before the battle, they called on the entire army to use intelligence and tactics to defeat the enemy, breaking away from the simple circle of morale-boosting mobilization. For example, a certain unit used the leadership spirit of "fear and fearlessness" to educate cadres to resolutely fight. Cadres at all levels of a certain unit conducted tactical inspections in various battles. A certain unit distributed small leaflets to soldiers, specifically pointing out ways to avoid casualties and achieve annihilation of the enemy, which improved the troops' combat morale and confidence in victory. (2) Through mass grievances, the determination of the troops to annihilate the enemy was encouraged. For example, a certain unit mobilized the people in the war zone to set up propaganda sheds, write "hope letters" to the troops, and organize landlords to complain to various squads, which greatly increased the soldiers' hatred of the enemy. (3) The troupe and propaganda team of the unit abandoned the practice of "performing big plays in the rear," and went to the front line in batches, holding small performances in the gaps between stationing troops, marching, and fighting. The content was the heroic stories that happened to the troops themselves yesterday or in the morning. A certain unit of soldiers and the front line drama club jointly performed a large-scale living newspaper reflecting the life of the battalion, which was very popular. (4) The battle evaluation also broke the old routine, replacing the simple explanation of the superiors with the soldiers' own tactical review. A certain unit launched a "three-evaluation" (evaluation of merits, evaluation of discipline, evaluation of casualties). When the director of the political department of the unit summarized, he pointed out that "evaluation of demerits" and "evaluation of consumption" could be added in the future, and the two items would become a "five-evaluation" movement.

　　战场宣传鼓动
    晋察冀有新创造
    【新华社晋察冀十九日电】晋察冀人民解放军某部，在石庄外围与正太战役中，宣传鼓动工作与战役讲评有很多新创造。（一）战前号召全军用智谋和战术战胜敌人，跳出了单纯打气动员的圈子。如某部以“恐惧与无畏”的领导精神，教育干部坚决作战。某部各级干部，深入各种战斗进行战术检查，某部给战士散发的小传单，具体指出避免伤亡达到歼敌的办法，提高了部队的战斗情绪和胜利信心。（二）通过群众诉苦，鼓舞部队歼敌决心。如某部发动战地人民设鼓动棚，给部队写“希望信”，并组织各家房东向各班诉怨，强烈增加了战士们的对敌仇恨心。（三）部队剧在和宣传队抛掉了“在后方演大戏”的风气，分批走向前线，在驻军、行军、作战的空隙中举行小型演出。内容则是昨天或上午部队自己所发生的英雄故事。某部战士和战线剧社共同演出表现该营生活的大活报，颇为大家欢迎。（四）战役讲评也打碎了老一套，以战士自己的战术检讨代替了单纯的上级解释。某部发起“三评”（评功、评纪律、评伤亡）。该部政治部主任总结时，指出以后可增加“评过”、“评消耗”，两项成为“五评”运动。
