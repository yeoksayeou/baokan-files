　　[Report from Our Newspaper in Taihang] Since the commencement of the hundred-day spinning and weaving campaign in the counties of the Second Special District in early March, significant achievements have been made. At the beginning of the campaign, all localities thoroughly conducted ideological mobilization, solved specific problems such as raw materials, tools, and technicians; mutually challenged and competed for meritorious service, planned, inspected, and summarized progress in stages, paid attention to rewarding and commending models, exchanged experiences, and promoted the campaign to gradually deepen and improve. Combining materials from nine counties, including Yushe, Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, Zuoquan, Heshun, Xiyang, Pingding, Taigu, and Qi County, a total of 118,912 women participated in the campaign, accounting for more than 39% of the total number of women in the district (the total number of women in the district is 298,753), and 86,373 women were organized for spinning and weaving, accounting for more than 72% of the spinning women. From March 8th to the end of the month, in eighty-two days, brilliant achievements were made: a total of 843,213 jin of yarn were spun, 719,815 jin of cloth were woven, and 115,608 jin of yarn were stored. Each spinning woman wove an average of six jin and one liang of cloth, completing more than 71% of the original plan (one million jin). Based on an average daily weaving output of 8,778 jin of cloth, another 168,004 jin of cloth can be woven in eighteen days. If all the stored yarn is woven into cloth, the original plan will be exceeded by 2,524 jin. If the women's participation in crash sowing and the resulting loss of working time are taken into account, the plan will be exceeded even more. During the campaign, counties and districts generally paid attention to transforming women, harmonizing family relations, improving tools, and improving technical work; according to statistics from three districts in Yushe alone, 229 lazy women were transformed, and one district in the Fourth District improved 42 family relationships. Xiangyuan County promoted 144 accelerated wheel spinning machines, and hand-pulled looms were popularized in various villages. In other counties, district and village joint cooperatives and individual mutual aid groups all used hand-pulling machines. Hao Guixiang in the Fourth District of Yushe created a wide loom, and the whole county can weave wide-faced cloth of one chi three cun to one chi five cun. Spinning women in Xiangyuan spun 2,130 jin and seven liang of foreign yarn, and Pingding can weave widened twill cloth. Counties generally can weave handkerchiefs and jacquard mattress covers, etc. The bad yarn was gradually reduced and eliminated in the movement, so that the quality of the cloth was improved. In addition to the low-level labor exchange groups and the popular point-counting labor exchange and equivalent exchange mutual aid groups, labor-capital cooperation spinning and weaving cooperatives and small-scale spinning and weaving factories have also been developed.
