　　Helps New District Masses Harvest Wheat
　　[This newspaper, Yubei Front, 6th dispatch] The People's Liberation Army under General Liu Bocheng is vigorously helping the masses in the newly liberated areas to harvest wheat. Cadres and soldiers are vying to go to the fields, wanting to earn merit in helping the masses with the wheat harvest. They have put forward the slogan "Where the troops go, help the masses harvest there." In the villages where the troops arrive, wheat harvesting teams jointly organized by the army and the people can be seen everywhere. The livestock of a certain unit's corps and various units are organized into harvesting, transportation, and threshing groups, ensuring that the wheat is cut well, transported completely, and threshed cleanly. The leaders of a certain unit's battalion personally led the entire battalion to the fields, each person helping the masses harvest an average of one mu of wheat. Another battalion helped the masses harvest 136 mu of wheat and carry 33 mu of wheat in two days; the communications class of the fifth company spares half of its personnel every day to help the masses harvest wheat. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are mostly emancipated peasants and skilled laborers, and are extremely popular among the masses. The masses in the new district said: "When Chiang's army was here, it was hell; when the Eighth Route Army came, it became heaven."
　　[This newspaper, Yubei Front dispatch] All directly subordinate organs of General Liu Bocheng's headquarters, amidst their tense work, had all cadres and soldiers helping the masses harvest wheat. The comrades of all sections and departments of the Second Detachment, under the personal leadership of Minister Lang of the Civil Affairs Department, went to the fields twice a day to help the masses harvest wheat. In addition to ensuring that meals are served on time, the cooks' class spares half of its personnel every day to participate in wheat harvesting. On the 2nd, the detachment had 79 people participating in the wheat harvest, cutting a total of 64 mu of wheat, pulling more than 10 mu of wheat, and helping a landlord's family thresh. The First Detachment helped the masses cut 50 mu of wheat in one day. The Fifth Detachment, while carrying out intensive technical exercises, began to participate in helping the masses cut wheat on June 1st. In two days, more than 160 people from the Second Squad cut a total of 94 mu of wheat and transported back more than 20 mu of wheat. The soldiers of the first and second platoons of the squad practiced at night and came back in the second half of the night. The next day they automatically participated in cutting wheat. The Merit Committee of the detachment specially issued a notice of commendation.
