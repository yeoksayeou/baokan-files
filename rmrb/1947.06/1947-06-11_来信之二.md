　　Letter Two
    He Gaomin
    After "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang" was reprinted in the People's Supplement, I loved reading it. When the standalone edition was printed, I treated it as a treasure to adjust my life during work breaks. This type of work, regardless of form or content, is truly beloved. I once chatted with several worker-peasant cadres, and they were also extremely interested.
    In the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region, I've seen several works, such as Comrade Ruan Zhangjing's "The Trap" and "Farewell" in the Literary Magazine, and Comrade Liu Yanzhou's storytelling song "Little Wang Wu" in the second issue of Pingyuan Literature. I also felt they were fresh, lively, vivid, and powerful. In terms of content, they can evoke a sense of tension, while in terms of tone and language, they give people a sense of ease and joy. I also introduced them to others, and everyone praised them unanimously.
    I am a layman in literature and art, but I feel that it is necessary to promote works like these. These works are masterpieces of national form that the masses can sing, read, and watch, and vividly reflect the real struggles. They are new products and new harvests in the literary and artistic field of our border region. Is it possible to compile such works into a special booklet for publication, like the reprinted "Wang Gui and Li Xiangxiang," adding illustrations or woodcuts to promote the literature to the vast number of district and village cadres and the masses? I feel that their practical educational significance will also have a great effect. (Omitted below)

　　来信之二
    何高民
    “王贵与李香香”在人民副刊上转载后，我就爱不释手的去读它，单行本印出，我又作为工作暇时调剂生活的珍品，这一类作品，不管形式与内容，实在使人太爱好了，我曾和几个工农干部闲谈，他们也感极大兴趣。
    在我们晋冀鲁豫边区我见到的几篇作品，如文艺杂志上阮章竞同志的“圈套”及“送别”，平原文艺第二期上刘衍洲同志的弹唱小王五，我同样感到新鲜，活泼，生动，有力，内容上都能引起心情的紧张，而在词调及语气上，却又都令人有轻松愉快之感，我同样介绍给人读它，大家又都是同声赞美。
    我是文艺上的门外汉，但我感到像这一类作品有发扬之必要，这类作品都是人民大众能歌能唱，能读能看，反映现实斗争有声有色的民族形式的杰作，是我们边区文艺领域中新产品，新收获。是否可将此类作品汇集成专门小册子出版，像再版的王贵与李香香，被加上插图或木刻，把文推广到广大区村干部及人民大众中去，它们的现实的教育意义，我感到同样是会有极大作用的。（下略）
