　　Postal Workers in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Perform Meritorious Service Delivering Mail Behind Enemy Lines
    [Reported from our Hebei-Shandong-Henan Office on the 5th] With the Post Office launching a campaign to perform meritorious service, work in all bureaus has taken on a completely new look, and postal work south of the Yellow River, behind enemy lines, has achieved even greater results. The rural distribution network in various counties of the Eighth District has reached more than 140 locations, and mail delivery is fast and accurate. Due to the addition of night shifts, newspapers can reach all areas within two days, a speed increase of three-fifths compared to February. This has led to a surge in newspaper subscriptions, with Zhang Bao, a postal worker from Puyang County, developing 40 new subscribers in ten days. In the First and Sixth Districts, since the proposal to orient distribution work towards rural areas, the number of newspaper subscriptions has increased from 2,394 to 3,574. Newspaper distribution work in the guerrilla areas behind enemy lines in the Third and Fifth Districts has also continued to increase. Postal workers in Chengwu County contact the front lines a hundred li away, day and night. Postal worker Ren Qinghai persisted in completing his mission for five days without eating during an enemy "mopping-up" operation. Postal workers Du Qingban, Zhang Xuelun, and Shi Zhenhai from the Fifth Branch Bureau contacted the central area on May 7th, traveling back and forth on the 150-li highway between Dingtao and Caoxian. Others would take two or three days, but they did it in one day. Li Chenju from Dongtan crossed the Yellow River to make contact, encountering enemy activity on the hundred-li journey, dealing with it alertly and flexibly, and completing the mission.
    [Reported from our Handan Office] The Handan City Post Office responded to the General Bureau's call to launch a high-speed movement, greatly shortening delivery times. For example, in the past, the journey from Wu'an to Handan was a day's trip. After November of last year, the Yutong Company was entrusted to transport by car, but the earliest arrival time was only 4:00 to 5:00 PM each day. From May 10th of this year, it was changed to a large truck transport system. Initially, it could arrive around 12:00 noon. After the launch of the meritorious service movement, the time was further accelerated. For example, Comrade Tian Ai returned to Handan at 8:45 AM on May 25th (3 hours and 20 minutes early), and Comrade Li Zhenjing returned as early as 4:30 AM on the same night of the 26th (7 and a half hours early). On the third day, Comrade Liu Guangjian returned even earlier, at 11:00 PM that night. Also, the round trip from Handan to Xingtai is 240 li, a journey that used to take two days, now completed in one day. The postal workers are constantly on the go, day and night, without complaining of fatigue. They also say: "To defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we must work as hard as the soldiers on the front lines to be worthy of the people." (Fu Gang)

　　往来敌后传递邮件
    冀鲁豫邮工立功
    【本报冀鲁豫五日电】邮局开展立功运动，各局工作焕然一新，黄河以南敌援邮政工作更获巨大成绩。八分区各县农村发行网已达百四十余处，邮件传递迅速准确。由于增加夜班，报纸能在两天内遍达各地，比二月份速度加快五分之三。使报纸订户激增，濮县邮工张报十天发展订户四十家。一、六分区自提出发行工作面向农村后，报纸发行数已由二千三百九十四份增至三千五百七十四份，三五分区的敌后游击区报纸发行工作亦有增无已。城武邮工不分昼夜到百里外前线上联络。邮工任庆海在敌人“清剿”中五天没吃饭仍坚持完成任务。五分局邮工杜庆班张学伦施振海等于五月七日东往中心区联络，来往于定陶曹县间一百五十里公路上别人要两三天，他们一天就跑到，东坦李臣聚横涉黄河联络，又于百余里路程上就地遇到敌情，都机警灵活的应付过去，完成任务。
    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸市邮政局响应总局开展快速度运动的号召，邮递时间大大缩短，如过去从武安到邯郸是一天路程，去年十一月后曾托裕通公司以汽车代运，但最快也只是在每天下午四点至五点才能到达，从今年五月十号改为大车班自运，先是十二点左右可以到达，立功运动开展后，时间上又增快了许多，如田爱同志于五月二十五日上午八点四十五分钟就返回邯郸（提前三点二十分钟），二十六日李振京同志于当天晚上早四点半就返回来了，（提前七个半小时），第三天刘光俭同志更于当晚提前十一点钟就回来了。又如从邯郸到邢台往返二百四十里，过去两天的路程，现在当天返回。邮工同志白天黑夜地奔走，也不说疲乏，他们还说：“为了打败蒋介石，咱们要和前线战士一样的辛苦，才对得起人民。”      （福纲）
