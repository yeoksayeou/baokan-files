　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 8th: In the initial phase of the summer offensive, the Northeast People's Liberation Army, within twenty days (from May 13th to June 3rd), annihilated over 50,000 enemy troops and recovered 25 cities. Currently, in the vast area stretching from the south bank of the Songhua River in the north to Qinghe in the south, from Tonghua in the east to Tongliao in the west, except for isolated strongholds in Siping, Changchun, and Jilin, the majority of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops within the territory have been eliminated. We also control over 2,300 li of railways, further linking the East, West, and South Manchurian Liberated Areas into one, greatly facilitating the concentration and mobile operations of our main forces in the future. The Northeast Democratic Allied Army Headquarters has issued its Sixth Communiqué on the Summer Offensive, summarizing the brilliant achievements of this campaign, stating:
　　Over the past year, thanks to the arduous efforts of the entire army and people in our Northeast Liberated Area, especially in the battles of "Three Crossings of the South of the River" (referring to the Songhua River) and the four campaigns to defend Linjiang this spring, we annihilated the majority of the Chiang Kai-shek-Du Yuming troops' active forces, reversing the initiative of the war. Our Northeast Democratic Allied Army then launched a summer offensive on May 13th, divided into three directions from East, West, and South Manchuria. At the same time, our Rehe and Jidong People's Liberation Army also took the initiative to attack, cooperating in the operations. By the initial stage of the offensive, ending June 3rd, within twenty days, a total of six divisions and one company of enemy regular troops were annihilated in batches, along with four regiments, one battalion, and three companies of local enemy security teams. Twenty-five cities were recovered, namely: Shuangshan, Huaide, Kangping, Gongzhuling, Tongliao, Tonghua, Shuangyang, Lishu, Liaoyuan, Dongfeng, Huadian, Faku, Hailong, Xifeng, Panshi, Changtu, Yitong, Xi'an, Kaiyuan, Qingyuan, Xinbin, as well as Weichang in Rehe, and Changli, Funing, and Qian'an in Jidong (Changli and Faku were actively evacuated after recovery). Over 2,300 li of railways were controlled. The main achievements are as follows:
　　In West Manchuria, our army first captured Huaide city on May 17th, annihilating the 90th Regiment of the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army and the 17th Security Regiment, as well as the 88th and 91st Divisions of the 71st Army coming to reinforce. The situation quickly turned, and wherever the offensive went, the enemy collapsed at the mere sight of our forces. Within a few days, we successively recovered towns such as Gongzhuling, Fanjia Tun, Lishu, Tongliao, Liaoyuan, Shuangshan, Bamiancheng, Kangping, and Faku. During the pursuit, we annihilated one battalion of the enemy's 2nd Security Regiment in Lishu and two battalions of the enemy's 260th Regiment of the 87th Division in Liaoyuan, forming an encirclement of Changchun and putting pressure on Siping. The main force then turned south, heading straight for Changtu, annihilating the remnants of the enemy's 91st Division, one battalion of the 87th Division, and over 4,000 local teams from five counties. We also occupied the new and old Kaiyuan county towns, controlling the Qinghe railway bridge, shaking the enemy's nerve center in Shenyang. The enemies in Changchun, Siping, and Jilin became even more isolated.
　　On the southern front, our army launched an offensive on the Shenyang-Jilin line on the 13th, along the Beishanchengzi, Lishantou, and Caoshi line, annihilating the enemy's 184th Division of the 60th Army, the 54th Division of the 13th Army, and the 20th Provisional Division of the 93rd Army, totaling three battalions, two companies, one security regiment, and part of the Transportation Police Corps. In Nanshanchengzi, we completely routed the reinforcements of the enemy's New 22nd Division of the New 6th Army, annihilating nearly one regiment of enemy troops. Immediately, we divided our forces and advanced on Meihekou and Dongfeng. The enemy in Tonghua fled without a fight. In four days and nights of fighting, we annihilated the entire 184th Division of the enemy in Meihekou, and eliminated one regiment of the enemy's 2nd Youth Division in Dongfeng. The enemy in Xi'an was unable to escape and was pursued and annihilated by us, totaling about two regiments. Our army captured Xi'an and Xifeng in succession, and another unit recovered Xinbin and Qingyuan. Thus, the northern and southern Manchurian armies, which had been separated for years, were successfully reunited. At the same time, another route of our army flanked the enemy behind Dandong, heading north to besiege the hard-pressed enemy.
　　On the eastern front, our army cut off the Lafa-Jilin line on the 13th, annihilating the enemy's 7th Security Regiment, sweeping through the enemy's fortified area, and approaching the outskirts of Jilin city. One regiment of the enemy's New 1st Army in Wulajie crossed the river and fled into Jilin city overnight, while the 122nd Regiment of the New 38th Division, guarding Laoye Ridge, was surrounded and annihilated in the Taiping mountainous area during its escape. Part of our main force then attacked the Jilin-Hailong line, recovering Yantongshan, Panshi, and Huadian. By this time, the enemy's 21st Provisional Division of the 60th Army in Hailong and Chaoyangzhen, under the pressure of our army, knowing that they were deeply isolated and without reinforcements, abandoned the city and fled north on the night of the 30th, and were completely annihilated by our relentless pursuit over three days and nights in the Jichangzhen area southeast of Shuangyang. Shuangyang and Yitong were also liberated again.
　　In Rehe and Jidong, the People's Liberation Army recovered Weichang on the 14th, and besieged Longhua and Chengde. On the 17th, they attacked and occupied Changli. On the 21st, they entered Lulong. On the 28th, they recovered Funing and Qian'an, and attacked and occupied more than ten stations, large and small, on the Beining Road and Jinzhou-Chengde Road, launching extensive sabotage and cutting off the two inner lines of communication of Chiang Kai-shek-Du Yuming's troops from the middle. Our army annihilated more than 3,000 enemies in the offensive.
　　In summary, during the above operations, our army killed or captured 29 enemy officers above the rank of regimental commander, including: Chen Kaiwen, commander of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, Zhang Bingchang, commander of the 551st Regiment, Wan Binglin, deputy commander of the 552nd Regiment, Yang Rang, chief of staff of the 21st Provisional Division, He Ershou, deputy commander of the regiment, Liu Guangze; Zou Lin, deputy commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, Yao Qingyu, commander of the 271st Regiment, Deng Heling, commander of the cavalry regiment (who escaped after being captured), Cui Shichao, commander of the 262nd Regiment of the 88th Division, Sun Yuqin, deputy commander, Yang Guangyao, commander of the 263rd Regiment, Wu Zubo, deputy commander of the 259th Regiment of the 87th Division; Xiang Dianyuan, commander of the 90th Regiment of the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army; Chen Chengxiang, commander of the 6th Regiment and concurrently deputy commander of the 2nd Youth Division, Chen Quan, deputy commander of the 6th Regiment of the 2nd Youth Division; Zhang Lianyun, commander of the 7th Security Regiment, Duan Songlin, deputy commander, Wang Anxin, commander of the 2nd Security Regiment, Xu Fangqing, deputy commander, Tian Zhong, deputy commander of the 6th Security Regiment, and deputy commander of the 8th Regiment of the puppet 3rd Army, the head of the Changli Security Regiment, and twenty-two others. Feng Yongmin, chief of staff of the 71st Army (previously mistaken as Feng Yunmin), Han Zengdong, commander of the 88th Division, Ren Xiaozong, deputy commander of the 21st Provisional Division of the 60th Army, Zhang Jiezhi, commander of the 112th Regiment of the New 38th Division of the New 1st Army, Liu Yixin, deputy commander, the deputy commander of the 550th Regiment of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, and the deputy commander of the 10th Regiment of the 4th Division of the 13th Army, and seven others were killed.
　　Preliminary statistics of the results of the battle: In the twenty days of operation, our army killed or wounded 9,267 enemy officers and soldiers, captured 42,464 enemy officers and soldiers, totaling 51,731; seized 20,516 rifles and short guns, 2,271 submachine guns, 1,485 light machine guns, 326 heavy machine guns, 3 anti-aircraft machine guns, 16 anti-tank guns, 67 grenade launchers, 268 60mm mortars, 69 rocket launchers, 100 mortars, 1 direct-fire gun, 33 mountain guns, 32 anti-tank guns, 13 howitzers, more than 6,342,800 rounds of various bullets, more than 331,600 rounds of artillery shells, 261 telephones, 34 radios, 142 vehicles, 683 warhorses, 3 tanks, shot down 3 airplanes, seized 59 parachutes, and countless other materials.

　　东北夏季攻势初步阶段
    我军共歼敌五万余
    收复城市二十五座
    【新华社东北前线八日电】东北人民解放军在夏季攻势初步阶段，二十天内（自五月十三日至六月三日止），歼敌五万余，收复城市二十五座。目前北起松花江南岸，南迄清河，东至通化，西抵通辽之广大地区内，除四平、长春、吉林等处孤立据点外，境内蒋伪大部扫清，并控制铁路二千三百余里，使东、西、南满解放区，又复联成一片，大大有利于我今后主力之集中与机动作战。东北民主联军总部顷发表夏季攻势第六号公报，总结此役光辉战绩称：
    一年来，由于我东北解放区全体军民的艰苦努力，特别在今春我军三下江（按指松花江）南与四次保卫临江诸战役中，歼灭了蒋杜军的大部有生力量，扭转了战争主动权。我东北民主联军乃于五月十三日分由东、西、南满三个方面，发动夏季攻势。同时我热河、冀东人民解放军、亦主动出击，配合作战。攻势之初步阶段至六月三日止，在二十天内，整批歼灭敌正规军共六个师另一个连，歼敌地方军保安团队等四个团、一个营、另三个连。收复城市二十五座，计：双山、怀德、康平、公主岭、通辽、通化、双阳、梨树、辽源、东丰、桦甸、法库、海龙、西丰、磐石、昌图、伊通、西安、开原、清原、新宾，外加热河境内之围场，冀东境内之昌黎、抚宁、迁安。（收复后主动撤出者有昌黎、法库两座）。控制铁路二千三百余里。主要战绩如下：
    西满我军首于五月十七日攻克怀德城，歼敌新一军新三十师九十团及保安十七团与来援之七十一军八十八师和九十一师，战局迅速急转，攻势所向，各地敌人望风披靡，数日内即相继收复公主岭、范家屯、梨树、通辽、辽源、双山、八面城、康平、法库等城镇，并于追击中歼灭梨树之敌保安二团一个营，及辽源敌八十七师二六○团两个营，形成包围长春，困迫四平。大军随即挥戈南指，直趋昌图，歼敌九十一师残部与八十七师一个营及五个县的地方团队共四千余，并进占新老开原县城，控制清河铁桥，震憾敌神经中枢沈阳。长春、四平、吉林之敌，更形独悬孤立。
    南线我军，首于十三日在沈（阳）吉（林）线发动攻势于北山城子、里山头、草市之线，歼敌六十军一八四师、十三军五十四师及九十三军暂二十师共三个营、两个连及一个保安团与交通警察总队一部，并于南山城子将增援之敌新六军新二十二师全部击溃，歼敌近一个团。旋即分兵进击梅河口、东丰；通化之敌，不战而逃。我于四昼夜战斗中，歼灭梅河口之敌一八四师全部，并于东丰消灭敌青二师一个团。西安之敌窜逃不及，亦被我追歼约二团之众。我军连克西安、西丰，另部收复新宾、清原。至此，隔离经年之我南北满大军，乃告胜利会师。同时另路我军，则侧击安东敌后，北上围攻捉襟见肘之敌。
    东线我军于十三日拦腰斩断拉（法）吉（林）线，歼敌保安七团，横扫敌要塞地带，进迫吉林城郊。乌拉街之敌新一军一个团，连夜渡江逃入吉林城内，而孤守老爷岭之敌新三十八师之一二二团，则于奔窜途中被我搜山围剿，尽歼于太平山区。我主力一部随即出击吉（林）海（龙）线，收复烟筒山、磐石、桦甸。至此海龙、朝阳镇之敌六十军暂二十一师，在我大军压境下，自知深陷于孤立无援，乃于三十日夜弃城北窜，复经我三昼夜猛追，悉数歼灭于双阳东南之吉昌镇一带。而双阳、伊通亦均重获解放。
    热河及冀东方面，人民解放军则于十四日收复围场，围困隆化、承德。十七日袭占昌黎，二十一日攻入卢龙，二十八日收复抚宁、迁安，并袭占北宁路及锦（州）承（德）路大小车站十余处，展开广泛破击，将蒋杜军之两条关内输血管，从中切断。我军于攻势中，歼敌三千余。
