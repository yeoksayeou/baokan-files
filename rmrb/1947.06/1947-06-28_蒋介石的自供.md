Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 24th: During the Northeast campaign to eliminate the 71st Army in mid-May, the Chiang army not only lost soldiers and generals and transported ammunition and weapons but also handed over their "confidential" documents for reference. In a booklet numbered 240, titled "General Review of the Strategy and Tactics for Suppressing 'Bandits'," Chiang Kai-shek's speech on April 20th, he confessed at the beginning: "The greatest failures in the 'National Army's' tactics for suppressing 'bandits' are: (1) Senior generals are often captured, and command posts are constantly attacked." He said: "Now, what the General Headquarters is most concerned about, and what is most troubling to the senior generals, is that our front-line command posts are often attacked by the 'bandit' army, and senior generals are often captured by the 'bandit' army; this is not only the greatest humiliation for our 'Revolutionary Army' but also the most serious problem for all generals in the current war to suppress 'bandits.' Therefore, at the end of last year, I believed that the war was the most critical moment of life and death for our 'Revolutionary Army,' so I constantly studied and reviewed, and based on the bloody experiences of the generals, formulated complete and appropriate countermeasures, and strictly ordered the generals at all levels to abide by them." However, in reality, it is still impossible to prevent this kind of mistake and avoid this greatest humiliation. Finally, the "Supreme Commander" could only helplessly say: "The revolutionary spirit of you senior generals has declined to such an extent that you don't even cherish your own lives and 'honor.'" (2) The reinforcement troops were blocked midway and could not accomplish their tasks. He cited an example: "We not only dare not bravely 'go to the rescue' (the two words are well-chosen, knowing that going there is sending them to their deaths, who is so brave? - reporter) beyond one or two hundred li, but even in areas within twenty or thirty li, such as the distance from Laiwu to Tusikou, which is only thirty li, the entire army dare not go to the rescue alone, but must advance with two armies. In the end, both armies are destroyed at the same time." So, how did he save his "humiliation" and "destruction"? Let's look at the following four wonderful plans:

First: "Now, most generals only harbor fear, saying how strict the Communist Party's organization is, how powerful the militia is, and our detectives cannot infiltrate. In fact, this is completely deceived by the propaganda of the Communist 'bandits,' so that their spirit is threatened by the Communist 'bandits,' and they have no confidence in victory. No matter how many troops we have, or how sophisticated our weapons are, in the end, we will be at a loss and only wait to be killed and eliminated by the Communist 'bandits.' Therefore, the only problem now is that our general senior generals must change their 'minds'. (See Top Secret Document No. 0468: "The Influence of the Spiritual and Psychological Warfare on the War of Suppressing Bandits.")"

Second: "Whenever our army enters a newly recovered area, it must gather the people in another area, completely isolated from our command posts at all levels." (Speech on April 20th)

Third: "Control the traffic. In the past, the Japanese devils protected the railway by patrolling with armored trains and digging trenches on both sides of the railway to rely on for resistance. Now we don't have so many armored trains, so we must pay special attention to digging trenches. The first step is to dig a trench on both sides about ten li, and the second step is to dig a trench on both sides about fifteen li." (Speech on February 19th)

Fourth: "If our troops are surrounded, the only way out is to hold on to the existing location, rely on our own efforts to survive, and never rely on friendly forces for reinforcements." (Chiang Kai-shek's speech on April 20th, numbered 0059)

But the actual proof is that since his generals "conscientiously followed" his "clever plans," there was still no way out, they were still "overly astonished and nervous," and the numbers of those annihilated and captured were still increasing sharply. Didn't the 90th Regiment of the New First Army in Huai'de hold on to the death this time? Didn't Chen Mingren, who reinforced the 71st Army, shout "heroic" words of "live and die with the army"? As a result, weren't the troops annihilated in exactly the same way, and wasn't the Middle-East Railway cut off in exactly the same way? In these confidential documents, only one point is useful, that is, he confessed that under the powerful blows of the people, the reactionaries are moving towards collapse.

　　蒋介石的自供
    刘白羽
    【新华社东北前线廿四日电】五月中旬，东北歼灭七十一军战役中，蒋军除损兵折将，运送弹药武器外，并把他们的“机密”文件交供参考了。在一册编号二四○的，标题为《剿“匪”战略战术的总检讨》的蒋介石四月廿日的讲话中，一开头就供认：“国军”剿“匪”战术中最大之失败：（一）高级将领时常被俘，指挥部不断被袭。他说：“现在统帅部所最怀忧的，也就是对诸高级将领所苦恼的一件事，就是我前方各级指挥部常常被‘匪’军袭击，和高级将领往往被‘匪’军所俘；这不仅是我们‘革命军’最大的耻辱，也是目前剿‘匪’战争中各将领最严重的问题，所以在去年年底时，我就对战事认为是我们‘革命军’最大的生死关键，所以不断的研究检讨，根据各将领血的经验，拟定了完备妥善的对策，严令各级将领恪守遵行。”但是，事实上现在仍旧不能防止这种错误，避免这种最大的耻辱。终于“最高统帅”只能无可奈何的说：“你们高级将领革命精神低落到如此地步，连自己的生命‘荣誉’都不爱惜。”（二）赴援部队中途被阻，不能达成任务。他举了一例说：“我们不但在一、二百里以外不敢勇敢‘赴难’（二字用得好，明知去送死，谁那么勇敢？——记者），就是二三十里以内的地区，例如莱芜到吐丝口距离不过卅华里，整个一军兵力亦不敢单独赴援，必要两军并进才行，最后结果，还是两军同时覆灭。”那么，他是如何挽救他的“耻辱”与“覆灭”呢？且看下面四条妙计：第一条：“现在一般将领只怀着恐惧心理，说共产党组织如何严密，民兵如何厉害，我们的侦探派不进去。其实，这完全是受共‘匪’宣传的欺骗，以致精神上为共‘匪’所威胁，对于胜利没有信心，无论我们有几多部队，有怎样精良的武器，最后必致一筹莫展，只有束手待毙，被共‘匪’所消灭。所以，现在唯一问题，就是要我们一般高级将领，要改换‘脑筋’。（见极机密文件○四六八号：“剿匪”战争精神的影响与心理战的重要）。”第二条：“凡我军进入新收复区之驻地时，必须将其民众聚集另一地区，完全与我各级指挥部隔离。”（四月廿日讲话）第三条：“掌握交通。过去日寇保护铁路的方法，除用铁甲车巡逻外，还在铁道两旁挖壕，以资凭抗。现在我们没有这许多铁甲车，所以要特别重视挖壕工作，第一步在两侧十里左右，第二步在两侧十五里左右挖一道。”（二月十九日讲话）第四条：“我们部队如果被围，唯一的生路唯有固守现地，自力图存，切不可依赖增援的友军。”（编号○○五九的蒋介石四月廿日讲话）但实际证明，自从他的将领们“切实奉行”他的“锦囊妙计”以后，还是没有出路，还是“弄得惊异过份、草木皆兵”，被歼被俘的数字，还是在激增。像这次怀德的新一军九○团不是死守了吗？七十一军增援的陈明仁不是喊了：“与军共存亡”的“壮烈”语句吗？结果部队不是一模一样被消灭，中长铁路不是一模一样被切断了吗？在这些机密文件中，只有一点有用的，就是他供认了在人民强大的打击下，反动派已走向崩溃。
