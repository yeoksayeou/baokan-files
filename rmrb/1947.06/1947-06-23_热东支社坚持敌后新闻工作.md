　　Hot Eastern Branch Insists on Enemy-Back News Work
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hot Eastern Branch and the "New Rehe-Liaoning" newspaper office have achieved remarkable results in persisting in news work in the KMT guerrilla areas. The director of the branch is Huang Gang. In order to adapt to the guerrilla environment, the staff has been streamlined from 46 people in February of this year to 23 people, and the publication of the newspaper has gradually changed from a seven-day publication to a daily newspaper; the sales volume has also increased from 600 to 1,000. It plays a significant role in guiding the work in the area, reflecting the struggles of the military and civilians in the area, and exchanging experiences. This branch was established after the withdrawal from Xinglong in September last year. The office is located in a desolate mountain more than seven miles high. During enemy "mopping-up" operations, they slept in the open day and night, and maintained their lives with sparse cornmeal and vegetables. When they were unable to publish the newspaper, they helped the masses with their work, production, or helped the troops with reconnaissance.

　　热东支社坚持敌后新闻工作
    新华社热东支社及《新热辽》报社在蒋后游击区坚持新闻工作，业绩卓著。该社社长是黄钢。为了适应游击环境，人员由今年二月的四十六人精简为廿三人，报纸的出版则由七日刊逐渐改为日报；销数也由六百增到一千。在指导该区工作和反映该区军民斗争，交流经验上，作用很大。这个支社是去年九月兴隆撤退以后建立的。社址设立在一个七里多高的荒山里。敌人“扫荡”时日夜露宿，以稀少的棒子面和蔬菜维持生活。无法出报的时候就帮助群众工作，生产或帮助部队侦察。
