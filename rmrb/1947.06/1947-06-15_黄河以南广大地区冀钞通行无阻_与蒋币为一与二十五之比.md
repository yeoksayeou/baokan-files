　　[Report from this newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu office on the 11th] In the vast guerrilla areas south of the Yellow River, the Jicha currency is circulating freely. Due to the activities of our guerrilla forces and the democratic government's persistence in holding positions and carrying out land reform, the prestige of the Jicha currency is increasing day by day. The exchange rate between Chiang currency and Jicha currency is 25 or 15 to 1. In some guerrilla areas in Jinxiang and Maomiao, Chiang currency is no longer used at all. The masses say, "Seeing that the Central Bank notes are so worthless, Chiang Kai-shek is about to collapse! Wasn't it the same when Japan was about to surrender, and the reserve notes were worthless?" Therefore, the masses quickly try to spend Chiang currency as soon as they get it, and keep Jicha currency in their hands.

　　黄河以南广大地区冀钞通行无阻
    与蒋币为一与二十五之比
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】黄河以南广大游击区内冀钞通行无阻，由于我游击队的活动及民主政府坚持阵地，进行土地改革，冀钞威信日益提高，蒋币与冀钞为二十五或十五对一之比。金乡马庙有些游击区蒋钞已完全无人使用。群众说：看中央票这样不值钱，老蒋快完啦！以前日本快投降的时候，不是准备票也不值钱了吗？因此群众一得着蒋币便赶快想法用去，得着冀钞便留在手里。
