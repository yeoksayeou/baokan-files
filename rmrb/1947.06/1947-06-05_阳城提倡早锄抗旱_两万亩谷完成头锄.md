　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] To implement early weeding to combat drought, in Yangcheng's sixth district, twenty-three administrative villages universally organized labor to go into the fields. The first weeding of more than 20,000 mu of early grain has already been completed. The remaining eleven administrative villages will be finished in another seven days, and twelve administrative villages in another five days. This tense and rapid situation is unprecedented in previous years. The reason for this is that district and village cadres were prepared for drought early on. Seeing that it wasn't raining, they proposed "Early weeding is worth three parts of water," mobilizing the masses to weed early, and taking the lead themselves. For example, the cadres of Nanpo Village went deep into the mutual aid teams, personally weeding seedlings in the fields, and organizing 125 women to participate. Now the whole village has weeded more than 1,450 mu, accounting for 80 percent of the grain land. The Bai Rusai mutual aid team in Lujiahe organized all the women and children to weed seedlings, with one old farmer assigned to each group for guidance. They are as capable as the full male labor force. For example, Li Xiao'e, Li Shuhua, Li Xiaoqi, and others all earned a full ten work points. In seven days, they have weeded two-thirds of the team's grain land. Jide Village organized cooperative employees, primary school teachers, and students to go into the fields, and rationally organized labor for military dependents. For example, Zhang Yue'e, a military dependent woman, led a military dependent women's mutual aid team, averaging more than two work points to weed one mu of grain seedlings. The other three military families also declined preferential treatment and did it themselves.

　　[This newspaper, Taiyue, 3rd dispatch] The entire county of Yangcheng has completed sowing, with all 310,000 mu of land sown. A total of 190,950 mu of millet, 52,552 mu of corn, 49,947 mu of cotton, and other crops such as ramie and hemp were planted. Except for a slight lack of seedlings in some villages in the first, fourth, fifth, and seventh districts, all other villages have reported full seedlings. Currently, the second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts have entered the weeding stage.

　　The first characteristic of this year's production is the emphasis on organizing semi-laborers and extensively absorbing women and children to participate in labor. Also, in view of the lack of rain in the spring, and drawing on last year's experience, although each village lacked labor due to participation in the war, they were able to start sowing early. The second is that after land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, and many liberated peasants have become the backbone of labor. The Zhang Yousheng mutual aid team of liberated peasants in Shangcun, District One, volunteered to plant more than 40 mu of land for military service men and military dependents. The third characteristic is the use of agricultural gaps to carry out universal sideline production. Yang Shaizhang of District Six used the gaps between sowing and weeding to go up the mountain to cut trees to make shoulder poles and handles, earning more than 2 million yuan. After planting millet, Xiasi Ping earned more than 8 million yuan in transportation. Currently, they are vigorously organizing drought prevention and famine preparedness.

　　阳城提倡早锄抗旱
    两万亩谷完成头锄
    【本报太岳三日电】实行早锄抗旱，阳城六区二十三个行政村普遍组织劳力下地，两万余亩早谷头遍已经锄完，其余十一个行政村再有七天，十二个行政村再有五天也可锄完。紧张迅速情况为历年所未有。其原因为区村干部早有防旱准备，见天不雨，便提出：“旱锄三分水”动员群众早锄，并亲自动员起带头作用，如南坡村干部全体深入互助组，亲自下地锄苗，并组织一百二十五个妇女参加，现全村已锄苗一千四百五十多亩，占谷地百分之八十，芦家河白如赛互助队，组织起所有的妇女儿童锄苗，每组配有一个老农民指导，她们和男全劳力一样能干，如李小娥、李树花、李小七等都记了全工十分。七天中所锄已占全队谷地三分之二。吉德村则组织了合作社职员、小学教员和学生下地，并合理组织军属劳动，如军属妇女张月娥领导军属妇女互助组，平均两个多工锄谷苗一亩。其余三家军属也谢绝优待，自己动手。
    【本报太岳三日电】阳城全县已播种完毕，三十一万余亩土地已全部下种。共种谷子十九万零九百五十亩，玉茭五万二千五百五十二亩，棉花四万九千九百四十七亩，其他为兰、麻等作物。除一、四、五、七区部分村庄略有缺苗外，其余各村均告满苗。刻二、三、五、六、七五个区已进入锄苗阶段。
    今年该县生产的第一个特点，为重视组织半劳力，大量吸收妇女儿童参加劳动。又鉴于入春少雨，吸收去年经验，各村虽因参战缺乏劳力但均能提早下种。第二是经过土地改革之后农民生产情绪大为提高，许多翻身农民都成为劳动骨干，一区上村翻身农民张有生互助组，自报奋勇给参战民夫及军属种上四十余亩地。第三个特点是利用农事空隙，普遍的进行副业生产，六区杨晒幛利用下种及锄苗空隙，上山砍树造扁担、做柄，赚洋二百余万元。下寺坪种完谷子后，运输赚洋八百余万元。目前正大力组织防旱备荒。
