Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: After the Kuomintang (Jiang) troops' plan to "complete the 'encirclement and suppression' before the end of April" in Central Jiangsu suffered a miserable defeat, they implemented a "scorched earth policy" in the Dongtai and Taipei areas. According to statistics, in the 35 days from April 16th to May 21st, under the bombing by Jiang planes and the arson by Jiang troops, 10 districts, 27 townships, and 5 major towns, including Fu'an, Tangyang, Dazhongji, and Xinfengzhen, were devastated by fire in 18 districts and 13 larger towns of the two counties. A total of 2,335 households and 8,137 houses were reduced to ashes. In Ti Dong Township of the North District alone, 342 households were burned, accounting for two-fifths of the total households in the township. In the area within a radius of 15 li from the small pier of Fangong Dike to Wangjia Pier, all of the more than 300 households in four villages were completely burned by the 79th Brigade of Jiang’s 49th Division within two hours. Dazhongji, one of China's eight famous cotton producing areas, also had its most solid 180-odd tile-roofed houses burned into piles of ash.

    【新华社华中四日电】苏中蒋军拟于“四月底前完成‘清剿’”的计划惨败后，即对东台、台北地区施行“烧光政策”，统计四月十六至五月二十一日的三十五天中，在蒋机轰炸、蒋军纵火焚烧下，两县十八个区十三个较大的市镇中，即有富安、唐洋等十个区，二十七个乡，及大中集、新丰镇等五个大镇惨遭火劫，有二千三百三十五家，八千一百三十七间房屋尽成灰烬。仅在北区堤东乡即被烧三百四十二户，占全乡户数五分之二。范公堤小码头至王家码头方圆十五里地区内，共有四个村三百余户人家，被蒋四十九师七十九旅于两小时内全部烧光。中国八大著名棉产地之一的大中集，最牢固的一百八十余间瓦房亦被烧成灰堆。
