　　Masses in Huguan City Enthusiastically Evaluate Merits
    Select Heroes for Planting and War Participation
    [Report from our newspaper in Huguan] On May 27th, Huguan City held a mass meeting of people from all streets to celebrate the victory of the front lines and the spring planting, and to evaluate and select heroes and models in spring planting and war participation. Each street first reported on the planting work and nominated various hero candidates, then conducted a merit comparison and evaluation, enthusiastically carrying out the election. Ma Shuangxi from Nanguan said, "Wang Xiaoxin from our street is good at labor. The mutual aid group he leads implements the combination of agriculture and sideline business. After planting, he also dug kilns and earned three shi and seven dou of rice. His mutual aid group has grown from five households to thirteen households, and many more people are looking to join." Huang Jindan from Beihe said, "Huang Fuhe from our village delivers three loads of manure before dawn, and after planting, he promotes women's spinning and weaving." Zhang Defu said, "Qin Nvnv and Feng Liuze from our village are military dependents. After their men joined the army, they unbound their feet, actively engaged in production, and established household businesses." Chen Baocheng from Nanguan said, "Ma Shuangxi from our street works hard and cares for the wounded on the front lines. Lian Jinling, the village chief of our village, cares for the families of soldiers and leads the whole village to plant early." Yougen from Beijie said, "Zhang Xiangyu, the logistics person in our street, distributes assignments fairly, keeps clear accounts, and has a good attitude." ... After a day of enthusiastic evaluation, Huang Fuhe and Wang Xiaoxin were selected as labor heroes, Cheng Haidong and Qin Nvnv as model military dependents, Ma Shuangxi as a war participation model, Lian Jinling as a model cadre, and Guan Yuhua as a model working woman. After the selection, everyone unanimously agreed that they were all meritorious officials leading the common people and should be given a major commendation and a certificate of merit, and a merit list should be posted on the main street.
    Finally, each street set a target to complete the weeding work within one month (from the 15th day of the fourth month to the 15th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar). In addition to weeding the millet, women should complete spinning five and a half jin of cotton and weavers should complete weaving fifteen zhang of cloth within this month. Their slogan is: "Strive for everyone to make contributions, and add contributions to contributions." (Ru Long)
    [Report from our newspaper in Licheng] On May 29th, Xiwu Village in the first district held a meeting of all the village's main cadres to discuss launching a merit-making campaign to further serve the people. At the meeting, they first recalled past merits. Zhang Deqin, director of the Armed Forces Committee, said, "Speaking of past merits, there are quite a few, but I feel that 'even with a thousand merits in the past, they are now fading.' I always feel that the superiors will not see the past merits (because the superiors are not fixed), and the masses have forgotten them. For example, I am an old cadre who has been in the peasant association since 1938. In 1940, I led the masses to check on reasonable burdens and fight against landlords. In 1942, I led farmers to clear debts and reduce rents, and farmers recovered 120 mu of land; in 1943, I established cooperatives and organized the masses to collect sheep manure and dig wild vegetables, saving the lives of more than 20 people and surviving the famine. But I always feel that these merits have long been forgotten and unseen by the superiors and the masses, and even if the work has achievements, it is only temporary, and it will be useless after that." Village Chief Song Shuangxian said, "I used to think the same way as you, thinking that the masses would forget and not see the past merits, and being a cadre is 'good is not seen, bad is seen.' Just causing trouble, I didn't expect that when the masses elected me as a model cadre last autumn, they also mentioned that I led the militia to fight guerrillas and rescue the masses in 1942, and received credit for obtaining gas masks. From that election, I realized that the masses will not forget the past merits." Political Director Sun Laohu said, "That's right, it's not that the superiors and the masses can't see our merits, it's that we cadres have been around for too long and have become arrogant and greasy, not working hard and not approaching the masses, so we can't hear the masses talking about our merits." Hua Shuikuan said, "We have a lot of merits, but I feel it's not enough, we have to do more good things for the people; and make more contributions." This opinion was agreed upon at the meeting, and everyone discussed the issue of making contributions in the future. After deliberation, everyone unanimously decided on five standards for making contributions: (1) Get rich yourself and organize the masses to get rich, making remarkable achievements. (2) Understand the masses' thoughts and run a mutual aid group well. (3) The work style should be democratic and pay attention to the mass line. (4) Create working experience that combines central work with systematic work. (5) Calculate accurately and pay attention to saving the people's labor to do a good job in supporting the army. (Ren Qing)
    [Report from our newspaper in Lingchuan] During the crash planting in various villages in Chengguan District this year, under the slogan of "plant early, rest easy," all 43 military dependents in Yungu Tu participated in production. Qin Leihua, a woman in her twenties, signed up to participate in production at the crash planting mobilization meeting. After declining the village's offer to farm on her behalf and proposing that military dependents should "add contributions to contributions," she took the lead in carrying manure and pulling the rake in the fields, and set a plan to get rich. She participated in a mutual aid group, planted nine mu of land, and earned more than ten work points. Under her influence, all military dependents in the village participated in production, and after the district notified and commended her throughout the district, it promoted the participation of all villages in the district. According to statistics, these 43 military dependents saved more than 1,300 workdays compared to last year. All military dependents in the district saved more than 10,000 workdays. After discussion by the masses in each village, it was decided that military dependents should be given credit. After reporting to the district, model military dependents Qin Leihua and Li Heidan, a veteran of Yaozhuang, and six others were added to the merit book. (Xie Fei)

　　壶关城内群众热烈评功
    选出下种参战英雄
    【本报壶关讯】五月二十七日，壶关城内召开各街群众大会，庆祝前线及春耕下种胜利，评选春耕下种及参战中的英雄、模范。各街首先报告了下种工作提出各种英雄候选人后进行比功评功，热烈开展了竞选，南关马双喜说：“我街王小心能劳动，领导的互助组实行了农副业结合，下种后又打窑赚了三石七斗米，他的互助组由五户到了十三户，还有好多人找着参加”。北河皇金旦说：“我村皇福和，天不明就送三担粪，下种后又推动妇女纺织。张德富说我村军属秦女女、冯六则，男人参军走后，自己放了脚积极生产，建立家务”。南关陈保成说：我街马双喜在前方参战吃苦耐劳关心伤员，我村村长连金令关心抗属，领导全村下种早。北街友根说：“我街后勤张祥玉派差公道，算账清楚，态度好”，………………经过一天的热烈评选，选出劳英皇福和、王小心等二人，模范军属程海东、秦女女等八人；参战模范马双喜等四人；模范干部连金令等三人；模范劳动妇女关玉花等五人，选出后，大家一致认为他们都是带领老百姓的功臣，应记大功一次，每人发了功劳状一纸，并贴功劳榜于大街。
    最后各街订出要在一个月内（阴历四月十五到五月十五）完锄苗工作，妇女们除拔谷外，在此一月中要完成纺五斤半花，织妇要完成织十五丈布。他们的口号是：“争取人人立功，功上要加功。”（如龙）
    【本报黎城讯】一区西仵村于五月二十九日，召开全村主要干部会议，讨论开展立功进一步为民立功。会议上首先从回忆过去功劳，武委会主任张德芹说：“说起过去的功劳来，到还不少，就是感到‘过去千有功，现在也扯松。’总觉得过去的功劳上级不会看见，（因上级干部不固定），群众也忘了，比如我自己是个老干部，从三八年就在农会，四○年领导群众检查合理负担和地主进行斗争，四二年领导农民清债减租，农民收回了土地一百二十亩；四三年成立合作社，组织群众拾羊肥、挖野菜，救活了二十余人性命，渡过灾荒。但我总觉得这些功劳上级和群众都早已忘掉看不见了，工作就有成绩也是一时新，过了那会就扯蛋。”村长宋双贤说：“我以前也是你这样想法，认为过去的功劳群众就忘掉看不见，当干部反正是‘有好不显，有坏就见。’光是惹些人，不想去秋群众选我模范干部时，还提出我四二年领导民兵打游击救护了群众，得了防毒面具的功劳，从那一回选举，我才认识到过去的功劳，群众不会忘掉。”政治主任孙老虎说：“对呀，不是上级和群众看不见咱的功劳，是咱当干部天气长了，就自高油腻，不好好干工作，也不接近群众，就听不到群众谈咱的功劳。”花水宽说：“咱的功劳是不少，可是我觉得还不够，还得再为老百姓办些好事儿；再来立功劳才是。”这个意见会场同意，大家就你三言我两语转上讨论今后再立功的问题，经过大家酝酿后一致决定出立功五项标准：（一）自己发家致富又能组织群众发家致富，做出显著成绩。（二）摸群众思想搞好一个互助组。（三）作风要民主，注意走群众路线。（四）创造中心工作与系统工作结合的工作经验。（五）精确计算时刻注意节省民力做好优军工作。（任卿）
