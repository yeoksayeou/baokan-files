　　Military University and Peking University Actively Assist in Farming
　　[Our Newspaper] According to incomplete statistics from the Political Department of the Military and Political University, regarding the achievements of assisting in farming: From mid-March to early April, within half a month, the entire school contributed 1,586 laborers and 147 livestock. They assisted 276 households, including 32 middle-peasant households, 60 poor-peasant households, 141 households of elderly, widowed, and disabled farmers, and 40 households of military, martyr, and cadre family members. They plowed a total of 479 mu of land, harrowed 29 mu, sowed over 12 mu, delivered 690 cartloads of manure, and transported over 310 cartloads of soil. In addition, various units greatly helped the masses with activities such as cleaning pens, transporting bricks, gathering firewood, carrying water, milling rice, and chopping grass. The upsurge in assisting farming is still continuing. (Mei Cun)
　　[Our Newspaper] All teachers and students of Peking University, responding to President Fan's call to "perform meritorious service for the people," enthusiastically assist in farming. When most of the villagers were away on errands and there was a shortage of labor, the entire school suspended office work and classes and mobilized all personnel to help the masses with the spring plowing effort. Currently, over 2,000 people have been dispatched. They have broken 45 mu of land, cleared stubble on over 1,354 mu, gathered stubble on over 72 mu, leveled soil and stubble on over 429 mu, and also performed other tasks such as turning manure, applying fertilizer, and digging field edges.
