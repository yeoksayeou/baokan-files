    Commends Guerrilla Fighters
    【Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 31st】On May 23rd, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government issued an order to commend three guerrilla combat heroes. One is Wang Ruichen, the captain of the Nanniwan Linzhen District guerrilla team, who is brave, resourceful, and flexible in combat. On one occasion, he led 14 militiamen to ambush on Shicun Mountain, luring the enemy into a trap, capturing more than 20 enemies including a deputy battalion commander. They seized 25 long and short guns and 4 warhorses. According to incomplete statistics: From April 10th to early May, the team fought six battles against enemy forces of about 200, winning every battle. The team has achieved complete self-sufficiency in equipment and ammunition through captures. Another, Xu Binglin, is a consistently victorious hero of the Linzhen District guerrilla team. In one month, he killed or wounded 19 enemies and personally seized 5 enemy guns. On one occasion, he led 8 militiamen to ambush about 200 enemies in Wujiagou, Yanchang First District. Three shots were fired, and the enemy battalion commander fell and died. They also captured two enemy plainclothes agents, who have been publicly tried and executed by the local masses. The third is Shi Xiushan, who leads the Heshui Fifth District guerrilla team. Shi led the team to frequently penetrate the KMT-controlled areas to carry out propaganda and capture enemy Bao-Jia personnel. In the liberated areas, in addition to combat, they also cooperated with the democratic government to carry out various war mobilizations and land reforms. When the enemy attacked Chicheng, Shi Xiushan monitored the enemy for seven days and nights without sleep. The team is united internally, and the masses praise it as the "Shi Family Father and Son Soldiers."
