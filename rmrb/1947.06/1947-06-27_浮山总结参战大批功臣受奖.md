　　Fushan Summarizes Participation in the War, a Large Number of Meritorious Servants Rewarded
    [Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 25th] Fushan's summary of participation in the Jinan campaign stated: In the past two months, a total of 5,891 people and 3,044 livestock enthusiastically participated in the war. Stretcher teams were able to complete assigned tasks at any time, and cart teams transported 27,180 jin of salt, 123,801 jin of oil, and 7,700 jin of cotton. Demolition teams breached city walls 479 times. In the process of participation in the war, 172 meritorious individuals emerged, including 49 county and district cadres, 46 village cadres, 65 members of the masses, and 6 teachers and doctors, who were rewarded. During the major assault on Quwo City, the entire county won the glorious title of "First to Breach the City." The enthusiasm of the peasants to participate in the war was unprecedentedly high. Lü Zigong, a liberated peasant from Sunzhai, worked tirelessly when breaching the city, influencing the cadres to also participate personally. Instructor Liu Bushen wore his hands raw. Yang Jinyu, a liberated peasant from Dongmagou, hid his stretcher-bearers in safe areas during the attack on Jicheng, but he himself carried the wounded on the front lines, and took off his own clothes to give to the wounded. Doctor Chen Tingwang treated more than 150 patients during the 30 days of participation in the war, and veterinarian Chen Cunli treated 33 livestock. Currently, in order to welcome the great counter-offensive, the county is verifying and rectifying labor and capital, organizing semi-laborers, arranging family production, and preparing for long-term participation in the war, based on the experience of two months of participation in the war.
    [Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 26th] Qinxian militiamen saved 4,433 jin of millet during two months of participation in the war with the army. They saved the 11 liang of millet per person per day for vegetables and the 1 liang of millet for study, eating wild vegetables in the fields and finding waste paper to study. When the militiamen of the Second District were active in Jiangxian, they used pine resin from the mountains for lighting at night.
