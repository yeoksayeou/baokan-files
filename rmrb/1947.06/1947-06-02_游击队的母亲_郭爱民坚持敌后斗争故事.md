　　Mother of the Guerrillas
    The Story of Guo Aimin's Persistence in the Struggle Behind Enemy Lines
    Guo Aimin is from Village × in the Sixth District of Pingyin. The work in this village was lagging behind. Initially, the village government was completely controlled by the landlords. Under the leadership of Guo Aimin, they organized and united the masses, and the village's farmers' association, women's association, and various other organizations were gradually established. The landlords tried every means to undermine the village government, once bribing her by saying, "Sister-in-law, what are you doing this for? If you don't have enough to eat, you can come over here and take a few bags of grain. If you don't have enough clothes, take some money and get some made." But Guo Aimin refused every time they tried to send gifts through intermediaries, and publicly exposed them. This spring, during the re-examination, she took the lead, leading the masses to divide the land. After the Chiang troops occupied Pingyin, she showed even greater determination. Once, the guerrillas needed to understand the situation and mobilized local comrades to scout east of the river. Although Guo Aimin had sores on her legs, she didn't hesitate to suggest, "I'm a local and a woman, so I can definitely complete this task." The superiors were concerned that the river was too large, the road was muddy, and her legs had sores, making it difficult for a woman to walk, but she insisted on going. After traveling and wading, she arrived in Pingyin and clearly understood the enemy situation. When she returned, she passed by her own house and went in for a look. Her three children were crying and wanting their mother, but she didn't stay long and rushed back to the team overnight. In the guerrilla隊, Guo Aimin was also a mother to the soldiers. She mended and washed clothes for the militia, tearing off the lining of her cotton trousers to mend clothes for the militia. In just one month, she washed more than forty quilts for everyone. The militia composed many songs to sing her praises, calling her the mother of the guerrillas.

    郭爱民坚持敌后斗争故事
    郭爱民是平阴六区×村人，该村工作落后，起初村政权完全掌握在地主手里，领导上以郭爱民为核心，去组织与团结群众，村中的农会、妇会和各种组织就慢慢的建立起来。地主们想尽办法破坏村政权，曾贿赂她说：“您大嫂子干这做么？如果没吃的，可到咱这边扛几布袋粮去，没穿的就拿些钱去做衣裳。”但每次托人情送礼物均被郭爱民拒绝了，而且当众给他们揭破。今春复查，她走在前头，领着群众分地。蒋军进占平阴后，她更表现坚决，一次游击队要了解情况，曾动员地方同志到河东去侦察，郭爱民虽腿上生了疮，但毫不犹豫的提议说：“我是地方人，又是女的，这个工作定能完成任务。”上级顾虑河水太大，路上泥泞，且腿上又生疮，女人走路不便等，但她坚持要去。转辗跋涉，她到平阴把敌情了解清楚之后，回来时走过自己家门，她进去看了一趟，她三个小孩正哭哭啼啼要找娘，但她没有久停，连夜赶到队伍里。郭爱民在游击队里，同时是战士的母亲，她给民兵补洗衣服，将自己棉裤的裱里撕下给民兵补衣服，仅一个月，她就给大家洗了四十余床棉被。民兵编成许多歌子歌颂她，称赞她为游击队的母亲。
