　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Shanghai, 18th: According to the Ta Kung Pao, a delegation of ten from the Shanghai Student Federation arrived in Nanjing and presented demands to the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Education, including the immediate release of arrested students, the removal of the so-called blacklist, severe punishment for the murderers who abused and shot students, compensation to the families of the killed and injured students, protection of students after their release, and a request that the ministry stop dismissing professors and staff under various pretexts. The Ta Kung Pao also stated that student delegations from Nanjing, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, and other provinces and cities had also made similar demands. Parents and guarantors of the arrested students are currently in Nanjing protesting to the Chiang Kai-shek government, demanding the release of their children.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: Shanghai News: Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangdong, and other places are extensively arresting journalists and searching newspaper offices. At the end of last month, Shanghai arrested four individuals, including female reporters Mai Shaomei, Huang Bing, and Yao Fangzao from Wenhui Daily and United Evening News, as well as another reporter, Yang Xuechun. In Chongqing, Guangdong, and other places, four arrest incidents occurred in a single day, with dozens of news professionals arrested. These include eight people such as Zeng Minzhi, a reporter from the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, Chen Fan, a special correspondent from the Guangzhou Ta Kung Pao, and Zhang Chen, a reporter from the Shanghai Xinmin Daily. Chen Fan was arrested while still asleep, with the accusation being that he had followed and reported on the strike of students at Sun Yat-sen University. The Guangzhou "Daily Forum" was searched, falsely accused of being the "general organization of rioters," and its editor-in-chief, Peng Fangcao, was accused of "close contact with the Indian side," leading to the detention of dozens of people.
