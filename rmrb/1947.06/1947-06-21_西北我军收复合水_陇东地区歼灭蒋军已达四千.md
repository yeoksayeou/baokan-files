　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 19th: The Northwest People's Liberation Army recovered Heshui City in Longdong on the 13th. Enemy troops invading the Longdong sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have so far been annihilated by nearly 4,000 men, and those who have collapsed are more than this number. The People's Liberation Army has successively recovered vast areas such as Huachi (i.e., Yuele Town), Jiangtai, Yuancheng, Quzi, Maling, Fucheng, West Huachi, and Heshui.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: More than sixty wounded and recovering soldiers of a certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army have now returned to their units to fight the enemy again on the front line. Among them, Zhou Jinkai was wounded in his right leg by a stray bullet in the Dishao battle on the front line. He tied up the wound with a bandage and insisted on staying on the front line. In the Yangma River battle, he bravely charged and was wounded in his left leg by a shell before being carried off the front line. Now that his wound has healed, he is asking to go back to the front line. He said, "The enemy has come to the border region, ruining the lives of the people, and the shells have wounded my leg. I want revenge." Liberation soldier Li Zhilian joined the PLA after being liberated in Qinghuabian. He was wounded in his right arm in the Yangma River battle and has now recovered. He said, "Over there (referring to the Chiang Hu army), I was always timid and listless when fighting for the Chiang Hu army. But here (referring to the PLA), I am brave because the Eighth Route Army fights for the people. As soon as I hear the gunfire, I charge forward. I don't complain about the pain when I'm wounded, and I'll go back to fight again when I'm healed."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 18th: New PLA soldiers from rural areas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have shown great determination and bravery in the war of self-defense. Many veteran soldiers praised them with the words "You are the most reliable in defending the border region." In the Zhuanmiao battle on the Linzhen-Jinpenwan line of the Gaofeng unit, a squad leader of the Ninth Company was aimed at by an enemy soldier with a machine gun who wanted to capture him alive. A new soldier immediately shot and killed the enemy from behind, saving the squad leader and seizing a machine gun. In the Songshulin battle, the machine gun squad of a certain company of the unit had only four men. After the squad leader was wounded, the gunner was also wounded. An old soldier wanted to help the gunner down, leaving only one new soldier to continue firing the machine gun, repelling the enemy's charge with two bursts of bullets. Cao Yangyu, a new soldier of the Third Squad of the Ninth Company of the unit, charged like the veteran soldiers in the Qinghuabian battle, seizing a machine gun and a pistol. In the Panlong battle, Cao Xi'en, a new soldier of the Ninth Detachment of the Xifu unit, captured four enemy soldiers alive after rushing to the hilltop. In another company, seventeen new soldiers had red marks on their merit books in the battle of Panlong.

　　西北我军收复合水
    陇东地区歼灭蒋军已达四千
    【新华社西北前线十九日电】西北人民解放军于十三日收复陇东合水城。侵入陕甘宁边区陇东分区之敌军，迄今已被消灭近四千人，溃散者则过于此数。人民解放军先后已收复华池（即悦乐镇）、蒋台、元城、曲子、马岭、阜城、西华池、合水等广大地区。
    【新华社西北十八日电】西北人民解放军某部六十余伤愈战士，现已归队再上前线杀敌。其中周金楷在前线滴哨战斗中，他的右腿被流弹打伤，自己用绑带扎好伤口，坚持不下火线。第二次在羊马河战斗中，英勇冲锋，左腿又被炮弹炸伤，始被抬下火线。现伤口刚好即要求再上前线。他说：“敌人打到边区，糟踏老百姓，炮弹又打伤了我的腿，老子要报仇去。”解放兵李志连，在青化砭被解放后参加解放军，羊马河战斗中他的右臂受伤，现已恢复健康。他说：“在那边（指蒋胡军）为蒋胡军卖命，我总是胆小没劲，到了这边（指解放军）我就英勇了，因为八路军为老百姓打仗，一听枪响我就冲，受了伤不说痛，好了再去打。”
    【新华社西北十八日电】来自陕甘宁边区农村的解放军新战士，在自卫战争中，表现得极坚定英勇。许多老战士以“保卫边区你们最可靠”的话称赞他们。高峰部在临镇、金盆湾线之砖庙战斗中，九连某班长，被冲上山的一敌兵以机枪瞄准，想捉活的，该班一位新战士，立刻从敌背后一枪毙敌，救了班长，又缴获机枪一挺。松树林战斗中，该部某连机枪班只有四人，班长受伤后，射手又负伤，一位老战士又要扶射手下去，只剩下一个新战士继续发射机枪，两梭子弹击退敌人冲锋。该部九连三班新战士曹阳雨，青化砭战斗中和老战士一样冲锋，缴获机枪驳壳枪各一。蟠龙战斗中，西府部九小队新战士曹喜恩，冲上山头后，一人活捉四个敌兵。另一连在蟠龙之战中，有十七个新战士在立功簿上记了红点。
