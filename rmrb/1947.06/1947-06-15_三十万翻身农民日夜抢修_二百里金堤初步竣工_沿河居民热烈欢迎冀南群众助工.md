　　[This newspaper's report from the JiluYu region, 13th:] Since the two-hundred-li golden embankment from Liuxiatun in the county to Tao Chengpu in Zhangqiu was repaired day and night by 300,000 emancipated peasants from the JiluYu and Ji'nan regions, it has been preliminarily completed before the wheat harvest. The dangerous section of 15 li from Lujia in Kunshan to Shilipu, which includes 53 dams, has been preliminarily completed by 20,000 people from Kunshan, Dongping, and Nanwang, who worked day and night throwing stones. At the Zhonggudui dangerous section in Yunbei, because the river course is winding and the floodwaters are rapid, Chiang Kai-shek's planes bombed the dam foundation several times, and the flood prevention materials were looted by Chiang's troops. The local masses, on the one hand, provided armed cover, and on the other hand, rushed to block the breaches day and night. The Zhangqiu section has been fully completed. The embankments under the jurisdiction of Shou (Zhang), Fan (County), Kun (Wu), Hua (County), and Chang (Yuan) counties have all been completed by one-fifth to one-third. The 23-li Lin-Huang embankment in the third and fourth districts of Zhangqiu was completed in only twelve days instead of the planned twenty days. Fan County completed the fifteen-day plan in only eight days. This time, the masses in Ji'nan traveled far south to assist in the work, enduring great hardships, and received a warm welcome and assistance from the masses along the river in Ji'lu'Yu. They were proactively preparing houses for them and lending them tools. Now, the counties and districts have suspended work according to the early or late maturity of wheat, and will continue to repair after the wheat harvest is completed, striving to complete it before the major flooding.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 12th:] The 20,000 disaster-stricken people from Kenli County, Bohai Sea, who were driven out by the Yellow River, have been properly resettled with the assistance of the democratic government and the masses. They have received a total of 40,000 mu of land and built more than 1,000 new houses. The 3,000 disaster-stricken people who moved to the Hebin and Linhe districts were allocated 11,000 mu of land. The democratic government also issued agricultural loans of more than 20 million yuan. The local masses also initiated a grain-lending campaign with a spirit of friendship to help the disaster-stricken people settle down and produce. In just five days, several villages, such as Xigudian in Linhe District, lent out 6,000 jin of grain, and absorbed the disaster-stricken people into production teams. They implemented land cultivation and government administration on behalf of the military and revolutionary martyrs' families who lacked labor. Some disaster-stricken people also obtained wheat fields and are now happily harvesting.

    【新华社山东十二日电】渤海垦利县被黄水逐出之两万灾胞，已由民主政府及群众协助安置就绪，共领到土地四万亩，兴筑新屋千余间。移至河滨、临河两区三千灾胞，即分配土地一万一千亩，民主政府并发放农贷二千余万元，当地群众亦以友爱精神，发起借粮运动，帮助灾胞安家生产。仅临河区西鼓店等数村，五天即借出粮食六千余斤，并吸收灾胞加入生产插伙组，对缺乏劳力之军工烈属实施代耕代政，部分灾胞并获得麦田，现正愉快的进行收割。
