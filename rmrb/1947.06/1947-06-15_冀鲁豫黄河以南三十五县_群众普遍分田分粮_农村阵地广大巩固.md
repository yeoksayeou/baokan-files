To Lay a Solid Foundation for the Great Counter-Offensive
In Thirty-Five Counties South of the Yellow River in Ji-Lu-Yu, the Masses Universally Distribute Land and Grain, Broadening and Consolidating the Rural Base

[Our Newspaper Ji-Lu-Yu, 12th Dispatch] The Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region summarized the guerrilla warfare south of the Yellow River over the past nine months on May 20, stating: Since the Self-Defense War, the vast areas south of the Yellow River have been successively occupied by Chiang's troops; after the Kahuayu embankment was breached and the river diverted, the Chiang bandits even implemented large-scale "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations. However, the people and soldiers south of the Yellow River have adhered to the principle of the enemy advancing, we advance, taking up guns in one hand and distributing land in the other, sparking an enthusiastic mass movement. This ensured that the rural bases in five districts and thirty-five counties south of the Yellow River stood firm and were increasingly consolidated. Thirty counties, including Qibin, Kaocheng, Junan, Chengwu, Dingtao, Fucheng, Juye, and Juancheng, carried out land reform and tunnel warfare in conjunction with guerrilla warfare. The tunnels in Junan, Chengwu, and the Qi-Kao area extended for four to five hundred *li*, with tunnels connecting fifty or sixty villages, covering major guerrilla areas. The landmine explosion movement in the First and Seventh Districts has also achieved significant results and is now being further integrated with tunnel warfare. Furthermore, due to the control of landlords, the peasants universally rose up to distribute land and grain. In some areas of the Seventh District, the land and grain distribution movement has penetrated into and near the Chiang's army strongholds. Some villages were fighting on one side and distributing land on the other, or fighting in the front and distributing land in the rear; some were conducting guerrilla warfare at night after distributing land during the day; some had the enemy in the east of the village, while the west was still drumming and holding meetings to distribute land. After the distribution of land, the peasants in the villages established armed forces to protect their land, and young people enthusiastically joined the army and the war. In Junan and Chengwu counties alone, 1,500 young people have joined the army. The characteristic of the guerrilla warfare over the past nine months is the gradual expansion from scattered sparrow warfare to relatively concentrated battles, and the gradual transition from attacking enemy plainclothes agents and "homecoming legions" to attacking Chiang's regular main forces, with victories achieved each time. In the past, Chiang's troops charged straight ahead, but now they dare not leave their strongholds more than five *li* away, and most of the highways and telegraph lines are frequently destroyed by us, and cars are constantly attacked and captured, paralyzing transportation. We have established a broad revolutionary order in the countryside and have a closer relationship with the masses, thus ensuring the victory of the guerrilla warfare. The results of the guerrilla warfare in the entire region over the past nine months are as follows: a total of 558 battles (small battles not included), killing and wounding 5,684 Chiang's troops, capturing 6,358, with a total of 12,042 killed, wounded, and captured; seizing weapons and ammunition including 2 mortars, 16 small cannons, 8 heavy machine guns, 161 light machine guns, 2 automatic rifles, 29 grenade launchers, 11 submachine guns, 3 pistols and signal guns each, 220 short guns, 6,863 rifles and carbines, 134 warhorses, 82 various artillery shells, 64 grenade launcher shells, 2,546 grenades, and 213,441 rounds of various gun bullets; seizing military supplies including 76 cars, 4 radio stations, 74 bicycles, 611 various knives, 3,610 *jin* of cloth, 28,649 *jin* of electrical wire, 7,368,100 *jin* of various grains, and 3.09 million *yuan* in legal tender. The ratio of enemy to our casualties is about 10 to 1. Due to the development of guerrilla warfare, the four reorganized divisions of Chiang's troops guarding Henan had to divide their forces to carry out "mopping-up" operations. We, on the one hand, persisted in the struggle in the hinterland, and on the other hand, concentrated local main forces to inflict heavy blows on the enemy engaged in "mopping-up" operations. In the × Mantun battle, we completely annihilated two and a half companies of the 74th Division; in the Weiwan battle, we routed the main regiment of the 143rd Brigade, eliminating 220 of them, forcing the enemy to tighten their forces and dare not fight again. We, on the other hand, became stronger and more courageous in battle. The guerrilla warfare continues to achieve new developments and progress, creating experiences in land reform, explosion, tunnel, and armed work team struggles. Our model battle case of annihilating enemy regular troops has laid a solid foundation for the overall great counter-offensive in the future.

[Our Newspaper Ji-Lu-Yu, 11th Dispatch] North of the Longhai Railway, south of the Yellow River, the guerrilla warfare in the 200-*li* plain area on both sides of the Cao (County), Ding (Tao), He (Ze), and Dong (Ming) highways has developed unprecedentedly. After our local corps and guerrillas, in coordination with the main force, recovered Fucheng County (newly established county) southeast of Cao (County), a vast guerrilla base area emerged. Villages with a width of 50 *li*, centered on Qing× Ji and Bodong, have carried out land reform in the guerrilla war. Since the return of grain movement, 330,000 *jin* of grain have been returned to the peasants. Under the influence of the Chen District, Heze, Dingtao and other counties are also vigorously carrying out land reform in the guerrilla war. More than 50 villages in Heze have carried out land reform, and villages 10 *li* away from the enemy strongholds are also enthusiastically distributing property and grain.

　　为大反攻打下雄厚基础
    冀鲁豫黄河以南三十五县
    群众普遍分田分粮
    农村阵地广大巩固
    【本报冀鲁豫十二日电】冀鲁豫军区于五月二十日总结九个月来黄河南岸的游击战争称：自卫战争以来，我黄河南岸广大地区被蒋军先后侵占；花园口堵口放水后，蒋贼更实行大规模“清剿”“扫荡”，但我黄河以南人民战士九个月以来坚持敌进我进，一手拿枪，一手分田，掀起热烈的群众运动，使黄河以南五个分区，三十五个县的农村阵地屹立不动，并日益巩固。齐滨、考城、巨南、城武、定陶、复程、巨野、鄄城等三十个县进行了与游击战结合的土地改革和地道运动，巨南、城武及齐考地区的地道，纵横达四五百里，五六十村一片的地道，已遍布各大块游击区，一、七分区的地雷爆炸运动亦有显著成绩，目前已进一步与地道斗争相结合。并由于控制了地主，农民普遍起来分田分粮，七分区部分地区分田分粮运动已深入到蒋军据点内及其附近村庄，有的村庄一边打仗，一边分田，或前面打仗后面分田；有的白天分田晚上游击；有的敌人在村东头，村西头还在敲锣开会分田。分田后的村庄农民即建立武装保田，青年纷起参军参战，巨南、城武两县已有一千五百青壮年参军。九个月来游击战争的特点是由分散的麻雀战部分的扩大为相当集中的战斗，由打击敌之便衣特务“还乡团”逐渐转变为打击蒋军正规主力，并每次都获得胜利。蒋军过去横冲直撞，现在则不敢轻易离据点五里以外，且大部公路电线经常被我破坏，汽车不断被我袭击、缴获，交通陷于麻痹瘫痪，我们建立了广大农村的革命的秩序，与群众关系更为亲密，因此保证了游击战争的胜利。九个月来全区游击战争战绩如下：共作战五百五十八次（小的战斗未统计在内），毙伤蒋军五千六百八十四名，俘六千三百五十八名，毙伤俘总计一万二千零四十二名；缴获武器弹药计迫击炮二门、小炮十六门、重机枪八挺、轻机枪一六一挺、自动步枪两挺、掷弹筒二十九个、冲锋枪十一支、手提式、信号枪各三支、短枪二百二十支、步马枪六千八百六十三支、战马一百三十四匹，各种炮弹八十二枚，掷弹筒弹六十四枚，手榴弹二千五百四十六枚，各种枪子弹二十一万三千四百四十一发；缴获军用物资计汽车七十六辆，电台四座，自行车七十四辆，各种刀六百一十一把，布三千六百一十斤，电线二万八千六百四十九斤，各种粮食七百三十六万八千一百斤，法币三百零九万元。敌我伤亡约为十比一。由于游击战争的开展，迫使守备河南蒋军四个整编师的兵力不得不分兵“扫荡”，我则一面坚持腹地斗争，一面集中地方主力给“扫荡”之敌以重创，×满屯战斗干脆消灭七十四师两个半连，魏湾战斗击溃一四三旅主力团，消灭其二百二十名，迫使敌人紧缩兵力，不敢再战；我方则愈战愈强，愈战愈勇。游击战争不断获得新的开展与进步，创造了土改、爆炸、地道、武工队等斗争的经验。我游击队歼灭敌正规兵团的模范战例，为今后全面大反攻打下了雄厚的基础。
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】陇海路北，黄河以南，曹（县）、定（陶）、荷（泽）、东（明）公路两侧纵横二百里平原地区之游击战空前发展。我地方兵团游击队配合主力收复曹（县）东南复程县（新设县）以后，出现广大游击根据地，以青×集、博东为中心宽五十里之村庄，已在游击战中进行土地改革。还粮运动以来，已有三十三万斤粮食归还农民。在陈区影响下，荷泽、定陶等县亦在游击战中大力进行土地改革。荷泽已有五十余村进行了土地改革，离敌据点十里之村庄亦热烈分财分粮。
