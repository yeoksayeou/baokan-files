　　Land Reform Movement in the Dingtao Guerrilla Area
　　Cun Ming
　　In early February, we inserted ourselves back into Dingtao for the second time. After gaining a firm foothold, we launched a campaign of grievance airing and settling accounts, returning the grain seized by the landlords. However, when we asked the masses to voice their grievances, they were reluctant, saying, "We're a sitting duck, and the enemy is a moving target. How can we possibly stand up to them?" and "Let's wait until we've taken Dingtao and Caoxian before we start complaining." The cadres were frustrated that the masses were unwilling to speak up. We didn't achieve much for two months.

　　Last year, when the enemy occupied our area, a poor family fled to Yanghe in central Jiangsu. When one of the refugee women returned home, she passed through Chengwu County and heard about "equal land distribution." She rushed home, her face beaming with joy when the cadres talked to her about land distribution. The leadership was inspired by this woman's willingness to accept land. They immediately went to Chengwu to learn how they were carrying out land reform. After returning, they held a county committee meeting and decided to implement land reform throughout the county, starting with the Rangu District. However, the district cadres were still concerned that the masses would be afraid to accept land and were not enthusiastic. During the meeting to discuss land reform, Lao Ze, the cook, overheard from outside the door and said to the district cadres, "You say distribute land, give me a gun, and I'll go home and do it!" The district indeed gave him a gun. He returned to his village at night. The landlord's dog barked, and he shot it dead. When the masses heard he was back, they all came to him. He led a mass meeting in the village, explaining the government's decrees. On the spot, he took the landlord's movable property and distributed it to the masses, and the land was also divided. Then he returned to the district. This was a great education for the cadres, shattering the notion that the masses were afraid to accept land. Then, all the landlords in the Rangu District were summoned to a landlord meeting. At the same time, an activist training class was held, and a demonstration was made at Sea Turtle Bridge, which activists were invited to visit. At the end of the training class, the masses of Lu Bridge put on two grand operas and a band of trumpets. The streets were filled with large cattle, clothes, and furniture confiscated from the landlords' homes. The district issued a notice that each village should send a certain number of basic masses to watch. The activists who saw it all expressed their determination to go back and do the same! At the meeting, the martyrs who died in the village were also mourned, which boosted everyone's morale. They all said, "It's worth dying for. The county magistrate even came to pay respects." As the activists were dispersed, the entire district was mobilized. Currently, starting from Rangu District, Dingtao County has seen 500 villages swept into the vigorous movement. The work of distributing movable property in the central area has been preliminarily completed, and the masses in the marginal areas are also asking the cadres to help them distribute land and property. The experience of the Fifth District (Rangu District) shows that after the counter-settlement of accounts, the landlords who were suppressed temporarily lowered their heads and dared not engage in open activities, but the masses still dared not openly raise their heads. A state of equilibrium of power (peaceful coexistence) had formed in the countryside on the surface, but in reality, the landlords still controlled the peasants. However, this was not the masses surrendering to the landlords, but a manifestation of even deeper hatred. If we can control the landlords well and strongly support the masses, the peasants will move. The peasants are seemingly afraid to accept, not because they are unwilling, but because they are watching to see how strong our support is. Based on this experience, the county committee decided to seize the gaps in the war and carry out a large-scale campaign throughout the county. Thus, the land reform situation in Dingtao County was opened up. First, village chief training classes were held. The content of the training was to talk about the current situation, explain the reasons why our army was bound to win, explain the spirit of land reform, and our determination to resolutely implement land reform. Before leaving, they were given three tasks: 1. Ensure that the landlords come to the meeting. 2. Notify the activists to come to the meeting. 3. Faithfully help with land reform. Those who fail to complete any of the above will be severely punished. After the village chiefs returned home, they immediately called the landlords and activists to a meeting. If the activists did not come, the village chiefs would kowtow to them. Sure enough, the landlords and activists all attended the meeting on time. The content of the landlord training class was to talk about current affairs, increase their idea that the world was changing (Chiang Kai-shek's world), and then state that land reform would be resolutely implemented. Those who do not implement it well and sabotage it will be beheaded. Landlords would be fully responsible for losses suffered by peasants when Chiang's army "sweeps" through after the reform. Before leaving, the landlords would sign a pledge to "donate land" and "donate property" within a time limit (the so-called donate land and donate property means the government confiscates it and the landlords hand it over directly to the masses). Those who fail to donate after the deadline or disobey in public and obey in private will be beheaded. When reporting to the district at the deadline, they must have a "completion certificate" issued by poor peasants and activists. Subsequent inspections that do not match the completion certificate will be regarded as forcing the masses to issue the certificate, and they will be beheaded. The content of the activist training class was to talk about the current situation, establish confidence in victory; express their attitude, share life and death with the masses; implement land reform, whatever the masses want is what they get; be strict with landlords in issuing completion certificates, and those who are found to be inconsistent with the facts will be severely punished. The masses also knew that this was a way for them to control the landlords. If the landlords sabotage the land reform, they can secretly talk to the cadres. In addition, during the emancipation, a mark should also be made for activists to participate. Hold a meeting to mourn the dead martyrs, lay the foundation for their confidence and determination, and stimulate their fighting spirit. After the meeting, the cadres organized armed inspection teams, and those who were found to be obstructing or sabotaging land reform were executed for serious crimes. This formed a movement of moving floating property from village to village and distributing land district by district. However, at this time, the main activity was still the landlords under our administrative pressure, and the masses still dared not act. Most of the floating property distributed to the peasants was broken furniture, and no good things were taken out. Some land was distributed less, some was falsely distributed, and some was even leveled completely (even the land of middle peasants was leveled); in short, it was very incomplete, but the peasants had already gained something, and they saw that the government was really supporting the masses, and the landlords lowered their heads, and their emotions gradually rose. At this time, the county launched another review movement with activists from the masses as the backbone. The experience of land reform in Dingtao proves that: first use administrative power to strongly support the masses, so that the landlords lower their heads and dare not openly resist. After the masses get some practical benefits, they will definitely become active. Then further enlighten their higher consciousness and openly tear their faces to fight against the landlords and find out the floating wealth. This is a way to review land reform in the guerrilla area. In two months, two-thirds of the villages in the county have implemented land reform and carried out one to two rounds of review. Even in the enemy-occupied areas, land reform was implemented in the same way by vigorously controlling the landlords in coordination with the armed work teams. For the middle peasants who suffered losses, the losses were compensated by further developing the struggle and investigating black land and black wealth. After the initial land reform, the peasants began to raise their heads in the villages. After the masses received the fruits, they demanded to arm themselves to protect the land. After Da Wu Ji distributed the floating wealth, 50% of the population of the entire village joined the organization and formed a gun squad. When they heard that the enemy had arrived at Huangdian, the gun squad immediately rushed to Huangdian and repelled two attacks by more than 300 enemies. The newly established model squads in Rangu Ji and Sanyi Ji also attacked the enemy. In the marginal areas, joint defense was generally established. After Miao Jincheng, the local bully most hated by the masses in Rangu Ji, was driven away by the joint defense force, he never dared to come again.

　　定陶游击区土地改革运动
    存明 
    二月初我们二次插回定陶，站稳了脚跟，便开展诉苦清算，把地主夺去的粮食倒回来了。但是叫群众诉苦时，群众有苦不愿诉，他们说：“俺是个死窝子，敌人是个活窝子，咱就能碰过人家啦？”“等打开定陶、曹县再诉吧”。干部看到群众有苦不诉，很苦闷，这样拉了两个月都没搞出很大成绩来。
    去年敌人进占我区时，一家贫民逃亡到苏中杨河，有个逃亡的妇女回家时路过城武县，听说“均地”，急急忙忙地回家，干部和她谈到分地，高兴的眉飞色舞。领导上从这个妇女敢要地得到了启发，马上到城武了解人家是怎样进行土地改革的，回来开了个县委会，决定全县搞土地改革，先在冉固区试试。但区干部还顾虑群众不敢要地，情绪不高，在开会研究土地改革时，火夫老泽呆在门外听，对区干说：“你说分地，你给我一枝枪，我要到家干去”！区里果然交给他一枝枪，他黑夜里回到村上，地主的狗咬，他拍的一枪把狗打死了。群众听说他回村，都来找他，他领导在村上开群众大会，说明政府的法令。当场把地主的浮财拿来分给群众，土地也分了，他又回到区里。这给干部的教育很大，群众不敢要地的认识打破了。接着把全冉固区的地主都召集起来，开了个地主会；同时又开了个积极分子训练班，并在瑟鳌桥做了个示范，叫积极分子参观。训练班结束时鹿桥群众搞起两台大戏，还有一班喇叭，街上摆满了从地主家收回的大牛、衣服、家具，区里下通知每村派一定数目的基本群众去看，积极分子看后都表示决心回去也要干！在会上又追悼了本村死难烈士，大家劲更大了，都说：“干啥，死了也值啦，县长还给吊孝呢。”随着把积极分子分散下去，全区大搞起来。目前定陶以冉固区为起点，全县已有五百村庄卷到蓬勃的运动中，中心区土改分浮财的工作已初步完成，边缘区群众亦纷纷要求干部去帮助他们分地分财。五区（冉固区）的经验说明，经过反倒算后，地主被镇压的暂时低了头，不敢公开活动，但群众仍然不敢公开抬头，在农村形成了表面上势力均衡（和平共居）的状态，而实际仍是地主控制农民，但这并不是群众对地主屈服，而是仇恨更深的表现，我们如能将地主好好的控制起来，给群众大力撑腰，农民便会动起来，农民表面上不敢要，不是不愿要，而是看我们撑腰的硬不硬。县委会根据这一经验，决定抓紧战争空隙，在全县大干起来。全定陶县的土地改革局面于是轰开了。首先，召开村长训练班。训练内容是讲时局，说明我军必胜的道理，讲土地改革的精神，和我们坚决实行土改的决心。临走时，给他们布置三个任务：一、回去保证地主来开会。二、通知积极分子来开会。三、忠实帮助土地改革。以上有一项完不成者严惩。村长回家后，马上找地主、积极分子开会，积极分子不来，村长就向他们叩头，果然地主、积极分子都按期到会了。地主训练班，训练内容讲时事，增加其变天（老蒋的天）思想，然后表明坚决实行土地改革，凡不好好实行而破坏者杀头，改革后蒋军“扫荡”时农民受损失地主负全责，临走时地主具结画押，限期“献地”“献财”，（按所谓献地献财即政府没收，由地主直接交给群众的意思。）过期不献或阳奉阴违者杀头，到期向区汇报时，要有贫农积极分子开的“完工证”，事后检查与完工证不符者视为强迫群众开证杀头。积极分子训练班，内容讲时局，奠定胜利信心；表明态度，与群众同生死共患难；实行土地改革，群众要怎着就怎着，与地主开完工证要严格，检查出与事实不符者严办；群众也知道这是给他们控制地主的办法，如地主破坏土改，可暗找干部谈。此外在翻身中还要做个标志给积极分子参加，开追悼死难烈士的会，奠定其信心与决心，激发其战斗情绪。会后干部组织武装检查组，发现阻挠或破坏土地改革者，挑罪恶重大的正法。这样就形成了村村搬浮财，区区分土地的运动。但这时主要还是地主在我们行政压力下的活动，群众们仍不敢行动，农民分得的浮财多半还是些破烂家具，好东西都没有搞出来，土地有的少分，有的假分，甚至有的推平头（连中农土地一概推平）；总之是非常不彻底的，但农民已经得到些东西，看政府真是为群众撑腰，地主低了头，情绪就渐渐高起来了。这时全县又来个以群众中的积极分子为骨干的复查运动。定陶土地改革的经验证明：先以行政力量给群众大力撑腰，使地主低下头去，不敢公开反抗，群众得到些实际利益后，一定会积极起来，然后再进一步启发其更高的自觉，向地主公开的撕破脸斗争，查清浮财，这是游击区土改复查的一个门路。两月时间，全县三分之二的村庄都实行了土地改革，并进行了一遍到两遍的复查。至在敌人占领区，由于大力的控制了地主，配合武工队，同样的实行了土地改革，对于受损失的中农，则以进一步开展斗争，清查黑地黑财来补它的损失，经过初步土地改革，农民在村中开始抬起头来了，群众得到果实后，产生了武装保田的要求。大乌集分了浮财后，全村百分之五十的人口参加了组织，成立了枪班，当听说敌人到黄店时，枪班立即赶到黄店，打退了三百余敌人的两次进攻。冉固集、三义集新成立起的模范班，也打击过敌人。在边缘区则普遍建立联防，冉固集群众最痛恨的土顽苗金成，被联防部打跑后，再没有敢来过。
