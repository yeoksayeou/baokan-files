　　The Heroic Struggle of the Taiwanese People
    Sent from Taichung on April 30th, Gengyin Year

    Note: This dispatch provides a relatively detailed report on the "February 28th" incident in Taiwan this year. It concretely demonstrates the scale of the Taiwanese people's struggle and its future development. Therefore, we publish it in full.

    From Welcome to Resistance

    For fifty years under the rule of Japanese imperialism, the Taiwanese people suffered profound oppression, exploitation, and humiliation in politics, economics, and culture. Everyone possessed a fervent heart that loved the nation and the motherland. When Japan surrendered and Taiwan declared its restoration to China, the Taiwanese people's fervent excitement reached its peak, believing they had finally gained liberation. When the Chiang government sent Chen Yi to Taiwan, the common people rushed from vast rural areas and cities to Taipei to welcome him. When the first Chinese airplane appeared over the heads of the Taiwanese people, they were so moved that they shed tears, and the elderly even knelt down to worship. However, after Chen Yi and his cohort of officials arrived in Taiwan, they brought new disasters to the Taiwanese people, engaging in looting and seizing everywhere. They seized all the land that Japanese imperialism had taken from the Taiwanese people, an area accounting for 78% of Taiwan's cultivated land. They seized 900 warehouses, 90 large sugar factories, chemical plants, companies, and banks. Furthermore, they extorted and exploited, collected grain in kind, issued banknotes recklessly, and raised prices. They did all kinds of evil deeds. Fertile land was left barren, factories stopped emitting smoke, unemployment rose, and there were food shortages and rampant inflation. In less than a year, the price index rose by 150 to 200 times. The hopes of the Taiwanese people turned into bubbles, and anger grew towards the Kuomintang bureaucrats and Kuomintang rule.

    The people's resistance arose, first manifested in the student movement that swept the entire province from the end of last year to January of this year. Clashes between students and police, and incidents of students attacking those wicked Chiang family bureaucrats occurred frequently. Almost all schools in the province entered a state of strike, which was unprecedented in Taiwanese history. On January 22nd, over a thousand citizens in Taipei City held a petition march due to high prices; incidents of rice-grabbing occurred one after another in various places. On February 25th, a moving message spread throughout Taiwan: a bus driver in Hualien Port, after being brutally beaten by "Central Army" (Chiang's army) officers and soldiers, drove the bus, filled with Chiang's soldiers (including himself), straight towards the sea in grief and indignation, plunging into the abyss of the Pacific Ocean, perishing together.

    The great fire of the Taiwanese people was ignited!

    The Bloody Struggle of "February 28th"

    On the night of February 27th, on Yanping Road in Taipei City, plainclothes agents of the "Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau" openly shot and killed male and female citizens in a bloody incident. Tens of thousands of people, with unbearable grievances, immediately surrounded the "Police Bureau," demanding that the murderers be executed publicly. However, Chen Yi fiercely declared martial law, which only intensified the people's anger. Early in the morning of the 28th, the masses went to the "Chief Executive's Office" to make the same demand to Chen Yi. As the masses reached the gate, machine gun fire suddenly erupted, and four people fell in front of Chiang Kai-shek's bronze statue, becoming the initial victims of the "February 28th" bloody struggle. This news spread quickly throughout Taipei. All secondary schools and above began organized actions. The masses, burning with anger, rushed into the largest state-run department store in the province, the New Taiwan Company, throwing all the goods onto the street and setting them ablaze, with black smoke filling the sky. Hu Wenhu's Tiger Balm Hall, which had colluded with traitors, was also smashed to pieces. In the afternoon, Ms. Xie, a female representative who had participated in the pseudo-National Assembly, was invited by Chen Yi to broadcast to the masses, saying that "the government will not shoot and kill people" and urging everyone "not to believe rumors." The masses responded to her shameless deception by rushing to Yanping Road, smashing her privately owned hospital, and burning all her brand-new dowry, furniture, and clothes in the center of the street.

    On the 29th, under the massacre by the military and police, the casualties of the masses increased, and the resistance became more active and powerful. The citizens of Taipei occupied the Taiwan Broadcasting Station, issuing three emergency alerts, calling on the people of Taiwan to actively prepare for battle for their own survival. Within hours, the entire island of Taiwan entered a state of combat. From the mainland to the sky to the sea, postal, telecommunications, and transportation were immediately cut off, and the people stood up.

    In Taichung City, the insurgent people controlled the entire city on March 2nd, occupying the radio station. In a certain area of Chiayi, the masses seized weapons from Chiang's army, driving cars and carrying newly seized firearms, forcing the police and military police to surrender to the people. Machine guns, mortars, grenade launchers, and other weapons were seized from the military police garrison. At the same time, government agencies were taken over, and the people elected their own representatives to manage public security. Under the control of the people, Taiwan's telephone, telegraph, radio, train, and car services were available to the people for the first time. On the 3rd, the student army in Chiayi City launched a formal street battle with Chiang's army, using rice bags seized from warehouses to build fortresses and using signal flags to direct combat. Although two or three hundred students were sacrificed, they finally captured the underground fortress, drove the enemy to the suburban airport, and occupied all the warehouses in the city, seizing a large number of weapons and equipment. On the same day, students in Tainan City conducted a vigorous propaganda campaign. Faced with the demonstrating masses, the Kuomintang military and political organs were frightened and knelt on the ground begging for their lives. The people immediately established a temporary municipal government and armed themselves with the full police, military police, and garrison forces, heading to Chiayi to join the battle.

    On March 4th, in Kaohsiung, a dozen students, carrying three rifles, charged straight at the Kuomintang military police stationed at the train station. Although one student was sacrificed, they did not shrink back and tightly surrounded the station. This news immediately excited the city's youth, who rushed to the middle schools, which became the operational headquarters for the people's uprising. At 6:00 PM, Fortress Commander Peng Mengji surrendered, admitting that he would return power to the people. But this surrender was false. He gathered the city's troops at the fortress headquarters, concentrating more than a thousand soldiers, and began a counterattack against the people. The people mobilized the masses in neighboring areas, confiscated police weapons, occupied sugar factories, and destroyed the Chiang regime. Meanwhile, the mountain compatriots of Gaoshan, known for their ability to cross mountains and engage in jungle warfare, also descended from the mountains in groups to join the battle. Under the bombardment of Chiang's army's coastal artillery, they fought fiercely for three days until Chiang Kai-shek's reinforcements landed.

    By the afternoon of March 8th, before Chiang Kai-shek's reinforcements landed, almost all of Taiwan was under the control of the people. The radio stations in Taichung and Chiayi frequently broadcast battle news: "Our compatriots in eastern Taiwan have shed blood and occupied various cities," "The pig army (referring to Chiang's army) has abandoned their armor and fled to the mountains..." This further encouraged the struggle of the Taiwanese people, who saw their own powerful strength for the first time. That reactionary force, which had been vast and tenacious yesterday, quickly collapsed in the face of the people.

    Bloody Massacres Drive the Struggle Underground

    The Taiwanese people wrote a glorious page in history with their own strength.

    After the Taiwanese people achieved preliminary victory at the cost of heroic sacrifices, the reactionaries adopted divisive and destructive tactics, using vacillating elements in the upper echelons to speak well of Chen Yi in front of the people. Chen Yi and Ke Yuanfen and their ilk also made cunning broadcasts, saying things like "The Central Government will never send troops to Taiwan, and I guarantee this with the noble personality and life of a revolutionary soldier of the Great Republic of China," and "The National Army will never open fire, otherwise I will commit suicide in public..." However, right in front of the radio, a burst of gunfire suddenly rang out, and dozens of young students in front of the North Gate Railway Department were shot to death; Chen Yi's deception collapsed on its own. So Chen Yi called out a group of "National Assembly representatives" to organize some kind of "Incident Handling Committee," and the Kuomintang's "Revival Faction" members also became active. In addition to destroying the people's struggle, they also took the opportunity to achieve the goal of overthrowing Chen (Chen belonged to the "Political Science Faction"), infiltrated the leadership organs of the people's struggle, and confused the situation. Although enlightened people, who clearly saw through this situation, warned the masses, pointing out that this was the Kuomintang's delaying tactic, the masses still lacked a high degree of organization and rich experience in struggle, and their pace became uneven. The highly conscious and organized people's armed forces, in order to preserve the strength for future struggles, transferred to the countryside and the mountains in advance.

    On the afternoon of March 8th, Chiang Kai-shek's 21st Division arrived in Taiwan and landed around Keelung. The Chiang's army, which had been shrinking back on the rooftop of the Keelung Port Authority, set up machine guns and fired on the masses. The landed Chiang's army killed whoever they saw, killing, looting, and raping. That night, machine gun fire was incessant in Taipei City. The sounds of gunfire from Yuanshan Songshan Airport, Ximen Barracks, Air Force Headquarters, and the "Public Office" were as dense as a string of beads. The next day, the 21st Division carried out an unprecedented massacre and rapidly expanded towards the central and southern regions. The student security team in Taipei City and many people from the "Handling Committee" were arrested, killed, and buried alive. In Kaohsiung, even more students were killed, and even more brutally, for their tenacious struggle. It is estimated that after Chiang's army's 21st Division arrived in Taiwan, the total number of Taiwanese compatriots massacred (including those killed by the original police and military police in Taiwan) was over 30,000.

    After Chen Yi was exhausted from killing, Bai Chongxi arrived, and Chiang's son, Jingguo, also rushed over, saying they were there to "be lenient" and "handle matters expediently"; but the massacres became even more brutal. Even now, when the tide rises, piles of corpses with their hands and feet tied, silently flow into the Tamsui River, arranged before the eyes of the common people. The people secretly buried these victims who died for them in their own fields, and also buried them in their hearts. After the massacre, a large number of people's armed forces transferred to the mountains again. This heroic struggle temporarily went underground. But this blood debt will be repaid sooner or later! The Taiwanese people are preparing for a new battle, a new counterattack!

　　台湾人民的英勇斗争
    庚殷四月三十日寄自台中
    按：这篇通讯对今年台湾“二·二八”事件之经过，有比较详尽之报导，可以具体看出台湾人民的斗争规模及今后的发展，故特全文发表。
    从欢迎到反抗
    台湾人民在日本帝国主义统治五十年间，政治、经济、文化各方面受尽深刻的压迫和剥削、凌辱，人人都有一颗爱民族、爱祖国的炽烈的心。当日本投降，台湾宣布光复后，台湾人民的狂热兴奋到了顶点，以为从此得到了解放。蒋政府派陈仪去台湾时，老百姓从广大的乡村城市赶到台北来欢迎他。当第一架中国飞机在台湾人民头顶上出现时，他们激动得淌下眼泪，老年人甚至跪下来膜拜。但陈仪这批大员到台湾后，带给台湾人民的却是新的灾祸，到处你抢我夺的劫收，劫收了日本帝国主义从台胞手里夺去的全部土地，面积占全台湾耕地百分之七十八；劫收了九百个仓库、九十个大制糖厂、化学工厂、会社、银行，并且敲榨剥削，征粮征实，滥发钞票，提高物价，一切恶事做尽。丰饶的土地都被荒芜了，工厂不冒烟了，失业，粮荒，物价狂涨；在不到一年中，物价指数上升了一百五十倍至二百倍。台湾人民的希望成了泡影，对国民党官僚和国民党统治，生长了愤怒。
    人民的反抗起来了，首先表现在去年年底到今年一月的弥漫全省的学生运动。学生与警察的冲突，学生围打那些万恶的蒋家官僚的事情经常发生，几乎是全省学校都进入了罢课，这是台湾历史上所未有的。一月廿二日，台北市一千多市民，为物价高涨而请愿游行；各地的抢米事件接连发生。二月廿五日，全台湾流传着一个可歌可泣的消息，花莲港的一个公共汽车的司机在遭受“中央军”（蒋军）官兵毒打之后，悲愤的将满载蒋军的汽车，连人（连自己在内）带车直向海边驶去，冲下了太平洋的深渊里，同归于尽。
    台湾人民的大火燃烧起来了！
    “二·二八”的血的斗争
    二月二十七日夜里，在台北市的延幢路上，发生了“烟酒专卖局”的便衣特务公然开枪打死男女市民的血案。数万群众忍无可忍，立即将“警察局”包围，要求将凶徒当众枪毙。但陈仪却凶狠地宣布了戒严，于是群众的怒火更高涨了。二十八日一清早，群众赴“长官公署”向陈仪提出同样要求：当群众刚抵门口时，机枪声突起，四个群众倒在蒋介石铜像面前，作了“二·二八”血的斗争的最初的牺牲者。这消息迅速传布全台北，各中等以上学校都开始了有组织的行动，为怒火燃烧着的群众，冲进全省官营的最大百货公司——新台公司的大门，把所有货物都掷到街头，一把火烧得黑烟漫天。与汉奸勾搭过的胡文虎的虎标万金油堂，也被打得稀烂。下午，陈仪请参加伪国大的女代表谢某向群众广播，说是“政府不会开枪杀人”，要大家“勿信谣言”。群众回答她的无耻欺骗的是冲到延平路上，把她私人开设的医院打得粉碎，把她的全新嫁妆、家具、衣服统统堆到街心烧光。
    二十九日，群众在军警的屠杀下，伤亡更多，而反抗也更积极，更有力。台北市民占领了台湾广播电台，发出三次紧急警报，号召全台人民为自身之生存，积极准备战斗。数小时内，全台湾立刻转入战斗，从大陆到天空到海洋，邮电交通顿时断绝，人民都站起来了。
    台中市起义人民于三月二日控制全市，占领电台。嘉义某地群众从蒋军手里夺取武器，驾着汽车，拿着刚夺过来的枪械，迫使警宪向人民投降。从宪兵驻军手里缴得了机枪、迫击炮、掷弹筒等。同时接收政府机关，人民自己选出代表管理治安。在人民控制下，台湾的电话、电报、电台、火车、汽车首次为人民服务。三日，嘉义市内的学生军与蒋军展开正式巷战，用仓库里夺获的米包筑成堡垒，以信号旗语指挥作战。学生虽然牺牲了二、三百，终于攻下地下要塞，将敌人驱逐到郊外飞机场，占领了全市仓库，缴得大量武器与装备。同日，台南市的学生进行了有力的宣传。在示威游行的群众面前，国民党的军政机关吓坏了，向群众跪地求命。于是人民立即成立临时市政府，并用全副警察、宪兵、驻军的武装来武装了自己，赶赴嘉义，参加战斗。
    三月四日，在高雄先由十几个学生拿着三支步枪，向驻守火车站的国民党宪兵直冲；学生虽牺牲了一个，但毫不畏缩，紧紧包围车站。这消息立即激动了全市青年们，纷纷赶到中学校，学校便做了人民起义的作战本部。下午六点钟，要塞司令彭孟缉投降了，承认把政权还给人民。但这投降是假的，他把市内军队调集到要塞司令部，集中了一千多兵力，开始了对人民的反攻。人民一面到邻近各地发动群众，缴警察武装，占领糖厂，破坏蒋记政权；一面以飞越山岭善于丛林作战闻名的高山族同胞也成群下山来参加战斗，在蒋军的海防大炮轰击下，激战了三天，直到蒋介石的援军登陆为止。
    三月八日下午蒋介石援军登陆前，全台湾差不多全部已在人民控制下。台中、嘉义的电台，频频发出战斗消息：“东部台湾我同胞已溅血占领各城市”，“猪军（指蒋军）弃甲往山上逃……。”因此更鼓舞了全台人民的斗争，人民第一次看到了自己强大的力量。那昨天还是庞大的顽强的反动力量，在人民面前迅速垮下去了。
    血腥的屠杀使斗争转入地下
    台湾人民以自己的力量，写下了一页光辉的历史。
    台湾人民在壮烈牺牲下获得初步胜利，反动派的武装镇压失败后，采用了分化、破坏的手段，利用上层动摇分子在人民面前替陈仪说好话，陈仪、柯远芬之流自己也作狡猾的广播，说什么“中央决不派兵来台，我以大中华民国革命军人崇高人格与生命保证。”说什么“国军决不开枪，否则我当众自杀。”……然而，就在收音机前面，突然传来一阵枪声，北门铁道部门前几十个青年学生被扫射死了；陈仪的欺骗不攻自破了。于是陈仪又叫一批“国大代表”出来组织什么“事件处理委员会”，国民党的“复兴系”分子也活动起来了，他们除了摧残人民的斗争外，另外还乘机想达到倒陈的目的，（陈是“政学系”的），混入人民斗争的领导机关里，把情形搅混乱了。虽然觉悟高的、对这种局势看得很清楚的人，向群众发出警告，指出这是国民党的缓兵之计，但群众还缺乏高度的组织性和丰富的斗争经验，步伐上发生了参差。觉悟程度高的有组织的人民武装，为保存今后的斗争力量，乃先期转入农村，转入山地。
    三月八日下午，蒋介石援军二十一师开到台湾，在基隆一带登陆；原来退缩在基隆港务局屋顶上的蒋军，就架起机枪，向群众扫射。登陆的蒋军更是见人即杀，杀了又抢，抢了又奸。当夜台北市机枪声不绝，圆山松山机场、析门兵营、空军司令部、“公署”四面八方枪声密如连珠。第二天，二十一师更进行了空前大屠杀，并迅速向中南部扩张。台北市的学生治安队及“处理委员会”的许多人，都遭捕杀、活埋。在高雄，学生因顽强斗争被杀的更多，更惨。估计蒋军二十一师到台湾后，屠杀台胞总数（包括原在台之宪警所杀在内）在三万人以上。
    在陈仪杀得精疲力尽后，白崇禧到了，蒋太子经国也赶到了，说是来“宽大为怀”“权宜处理”；但屠杀更凶，至今当海潮涨时，一堆堆手足被反绑着的尸体，默默地流进了淡水河，排列在老百姓眼前。人民偷偷地把这些为自己而死去的受难者掩埋在自己的田地里，同时也埋在自己的心底里。大屠杀后，人民武装又有大批的转入山地，这一英勇的斗争暂时转入了地下。但是这笔血债是迟早要索回的！台湾人民正准备着新的战斗，新的反攻！
