(Our Newspaper, Taiyue, 23rd Dispatch) The villages in the First District (New District) of Fushan have ignited the flames of emancipation. According to statistics from five administrative villages (sixty-two natural villages), forty-nine villages, including Nanxihe and Donglu, have already begun to speak out about their sufferings. The remaining fourteen villages, including Matai, are also ripe for action. The movement has moved from denouncing the suffering caused by the Chiang army to denouncing the evils of landlords and local bullies. A total of thirty-nine landlords and treacherous bullies and fifty feudal rich peasants have been identified, and fifty meetings have been held to speak out about suffering and wage struggle. In twenty-two natural villages, including Zhongcun, twenty-six households of struggle targets were discovered to have concealed more than 1,500 mu of land openly and secretly. During the process, it was discovered that some of the masses still had fears of "the sky changing," because the enemy spread many rumors when they retreated, saying that they would return. The "secret sect" in the Xincun area also secretly fabricated rumors such as: "Don't worry, watch 'June 9th' (meaning they will come again on June 9th)," and "Sit at home with the door closed, and disaster will fall from the sky. Those who carry out struggle will not be protected by the gods." The masses mistakenly believed the rumors and even concealed feudal vestiges. After understanding this situation, the cadres immediately exposed the special agents' rumors to the masses, and told them about our army's victory news and the policy of "land to the tiller." Zhongcun held a comparison meeting to expose the crimes of old Chiang and young Chiang among the masses, arousing the masses' indignation. Attention was paid to cultivating activists during the movement. They first selected women activists with good backgrounds and qualities, Duan Xianglian and Zhang Shaolan, and connected with forty-seven women. Then, they selected a good activist from outsiders, Zhang Fude, to let sufferers connect with sufferers. First, outsiders connected with local mixed surnames, then the poorest connected with poor peasants, and then the poor peasants connected with middle peasants, bypassing the landlords and treacherous bullies, and forming a united front of peasants for land distribution.

　　结成分田联合阵线
    浮山新区遍燃翻身烽火
    【本报太岳二十三日电】浮山一区（新区）各村已燃起翻身烽火。据五个行政村（六十二个自然村）统计，现已有南席河、东鲁等四十九个村进入诉苦，其余马台等十四个村也已经酝酿成熟。运动系由诉蒋军苦深入到诉地主恶霸苦，共找出地主和奸霸卅九个，封建富农五十个，开诉苦斗争会五十次。中村等二十二个自然村发现了二十六户斗争对象隐蔽地和黑地一千五百亩以上，工作进行中曾发现部分群众还存在着怕“变天”思想，因为敌人退走时放出许多谣言，说他们还要来，新村一带的“秘密教”也暗中造出：“不要愁，看‘六九’（意即六月九日还要来）”“闭门家中坐，从天降下灾，实行斗争人，神就不保护。”等谣言，群众误信谣言，甚至隐蔽封建尾巴。干部了解这一情况后，即向群众揭破特务造谣，并向群众讲述我军胜利消息和耕者有其田的政策。中村开比一比会，在群众中揭露老蒋小蒋罪恶，激起群众的义愤。从运动中注意培养积极分子，他们先拣成分好、品质好的妇女积极分子段香莲、张绍兰二人串通了四十七个妇女，又从外县人里面拣好的积极分子张福德，让他苦人联苦人，先由外县人联在地杂姓，并由赤贫联贫农，再由贫农联中农，撇过地主奸霸的一伙，结成了农民分田的联合阵线。
