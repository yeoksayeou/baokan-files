　　Julu South Shenglou Village
    Implements Preferential Treatment Work Vouchers
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 9th dispatch] Shenglou Village in Julu South Shunhe District has created a work voucher system for preferential treatment of military families. Through precise calculation and organization of military family labor, significant results have been achieved. The method is as follows: First, the evaluation committee calculates the amount of labor needed based on the specific circumstances of each military family. For example, Bu Xianzong's family has a total of twenty-six mu of land, twelve mu planted with sorghum, four mu with millet, and ten and a half mu with wheat. There are two laborers and one woman in the family. She can harvest eight mu of wheat herself in three days, and the remaining two mu require one work unit (one mu of wheat harvested counts as one work unit). Threshing requires one work unit. For the first weeding of the twelve mu of sorghum, she can weed six mu herself in four days. For the first weeding of the millet, she can weed two mu herself. The remaining six mu of sorghum and one mu of millet require seven work units. For the second weeding of sorghum and millet, she can weed ten mu herself. The remaining six mu require three work units. From plowing the spring land to finishing the threshing, his family needs twelve work units. The village has seven military families with a total of one hundred and fifty-one mu of land. After deducting one full laborer and six and a half part-time laborers, ninety-nine work units are needed. The village issues ninety-nine work vouchers to the military families. It is also stipulated that: (1) Work vouchers are issued seasonally, from spring seedling weeding to field clearing. During slack times, the preferential treatment committee can adjust work for military families. (2) Wheat harvesting is calculated at three days, and seedling weeding is calculated at four days because less time would exceed the general farming season, and more time would harm crop yields. (3) Weeding the first time counts as one work unit per mu, and weeding the second time counts as one work unit per two mu. This solves the problems of early tightness and later slackness, uneven care, and wasted labor in preferential treatment work. Cadres, the masses, and military families all respond well. Currently, all ten districts in the county are using Shenglou as a model and promoting it to various villages.
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 9th dispatch] After the Guancheng conscription movement, various villages have successively established military family work committees, launching a mass campaign for preferential treatment of military families. Now that the spring plowing is complete, in addition to building houses and doing odd jobs for military families, various villages are preparing to harvest wheat for them. At a mass meeting in the first district, Wu Koufeng studied preferential treatment work. Children said, "We are small and have no strength, so we cannot help military families work in the fields. We will take care of fetching water for all military families in the village." The women's association proposed to weave cloth and sew for military families, while the agricultural association members guaranteed to harvest wheat and do chores for military families. In Dengzhuang, the fourth district, there are twenty military families. The preferential treatment committee is responsible for hauling manure, weeding, and doing odd jobs for military families. Now that the spring seedlings have been planted throughout the village, they are hauling soil to build houses and stack walls for military families. Villages such as Magou in the first district and Tongzhi in the fourth district are also universally repairing houses and stacking wall heads for military families. In order to ensure that military families have no difficulty eating vegetables, the Pan Zhuang Children's Corps is planting vegetables for military families and preparing to harvest wheat and glean wheat stubble for military families.

　　巨南升楼村
    实行优军工票
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】巨南顺河区升楼村优军工作创造工票制度，精确计算，组织军属劳力，获得显著成绩。办法是：首由评议委员会根据各军属具体情况计算需工多少，如军属卜现宗共二十六亩地，种高粱十二亩，谷子四亩，麦子十亩半，劳动力两个，还有一个妇女，割麦三天自己能割八亩，下余二亩需一个工（割麦一亩算一个工）。打场需要一个工，十二亩高粱锄头遍，自己四天能锄六亩，头遍谷子自己能锄二亩，下余二六亩高粱一亩谷子需要七个工。高粱谷子二遍自己能锄十亩，下余六亩需要三个工，从锄春地到打完场止，他家需十二个工，全村七家军属一百五十一亩地，除去一个劳动力，六个半劳动力外，需九十九个工，由村里发给军属九十九个工票。并规定：（一）工票按季节发，从锄春苗到场光，至于闲时军属有活可由优委会调剂。（二）割麦按三天，锄苗按四天计，因为再少了超过一般农时，再多了伤害庄稼收成。（三）锄地头遍一亩算一个工，二遍二亩算一个工。这样就解决了优军工作中的先紧后松，照顾不均，浪费劳力等偏向，干部、群众、军属都反映好，现全县共十个区，都以升楼作典范，向各村推广中。
    【本报冀鲁豫九日电】观城参军运动后，各村纷纷设立军工属委员会，掀起群众性的优军竞赛。现在春耕已毕，各村除给军属盖房子作零活外，正准备给军属收麦。一区五口封在群众大会上研究优军工作时，儿童说：“俺个子很小，没力气，不能帮助军属在地里作活，俺包办全村军属吃水。”青妇提出给军属织布作针线，农会员则保证给军属收麦做活。四区邓庄共有军属二十家，优军委员会负责给军属推粪、锄草、作零活。现在全村春苗已种完，正给军属拉土盖房垛墙。一区马沟，四区同智等村亦普遍为军属修理房子，垛墙头。潘庄儿童团为了使军属吃菜不困难，给军属种菜，又准备给军属割麦子拾麦楂。
