　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 22nd—In a tense and fierce pursuit battle, the Chiang Army's 81st Division, defeated and retreating from Huanxian, was almost completely annihilated. The Northwest People's Liberation Army captured Huanxian city on the 16th, and the Chiang Army defending the city was immediately wiped out, with more than 500 men annihilated. The remaining troops were squeezed into four or five groups, desperately fleeing in the northeast direction. The Liberation Army closely pursued them. The Chiang Army officers and soldiers had no will to fight, discarding all their weapons along the way, even their hats and shoes, fleeing barefoot and naked. When they were exhausted, they surrendered one after another. Starting from 12:00 on the 16th, the Liberation Army pursued for more than a hundred miles, and finally completed this pursuit battle and won a complete victory by dusk on the 18th. The Chiang Army's 81st Division, except for its division headquarters located far away in Wangbu, and its 179th Regiment, which was annihilated at Jiangtai on the 30th of last month, had a total of three regiments and one brigade headquarters, with a total number of less than 4,000 men. About 1,500 men were annihilated or fled home, totaling more than 3,000 men, so no more than several hundred remained. Currently, the local armed forces are still meticulously searching in the barren mountains and ravines. According to the final clearing statistics, a total of more than 1,100 people were captured alive, more than 400 were killed or wounded, and the following were seized: 6 mountain guns, 30 mortars, 17 60mm mortars, 28 grenade launchers, 20 rifle grenade launchers, 30 heavy machine guns, 60 light machine guns, more than 1,000 rifles, 500,000 rounds of ammunition, one radio station, ten telephones, more than 200 war horses, 35 camels, 14 automobiles (of which 10 were burned), and dozens of tents (captures by local guerrillas and the people are not included).
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest Front, 22nd—The People's Guerrilla of Xinzheng County, Guanzhong Sub-district, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, liberated Yongle Town, sixty li northeast of @zhou, on the 11th. The defending enemy, the @zhou Self-Defense Force, fled in disarray. The guerrillas seized more than ten guns and more than ten dan of wheat. Since the Guanzhong People's Guerrilla Forces launched attacks on the Chiang-controlled areas, they have successively liberated @yi county and many important towns such as Longfang, Jiping, Zhanghong, and Shidian. The area they have liberated is almost the total area of the original Guanzhong Sub-district.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd—The local corps and guerrillas of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region created a brilliant result of 45 to 1 in enemy-to-us casualties in May. According to the announcement of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Joint Defense Army Headquarters, a total of 102 battles were fought throughout the month, annihilating 997 Chiang-Hu troops, including 265 killed or wounded, 732 captured, and the following were seized: 1 mortar, 12 light and heavy machine guns, 591 rifles, 11 short guns, 10,000 rounds of ammunition, 765 hand grenades, 60 rifle grenades, 60 gun carriages, 44 war horses, 6,704 catties of grain, 10 million Chiang currency, and 4 automobiles were destroyed. Our army suffered only 22 casualties.
