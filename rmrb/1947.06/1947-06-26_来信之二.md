　　Letter Two
　　To the responsible comrades of the Vanguard Theater Troupe and the Literary Association:
　　(Omitted preceding text) I feel that our music work, relying on this kind of sporadic solicitation from below, is like sharpening our swords at the last minute, which cannot keep up with the needs. Because the soldiers at the front make many heroic and moving achievements every day, but our songs of praise are far behind them. In order to actively examine and improve this work, I suggest:

　　1. In the future, we should have an organized understanding of how many old music workers there are in our area in the past? How many new ones are emerging now? Establish contact with them, mutually absorb experience under the principle of assistance, and boldly and extensively encourage creation.

　　2. Call on music workers to go to the troops and the countryside, especially to the front lines of the self-defense war, to study and understand the soldiers' thoughts, feelings, and needs. Sitting in the office and concocting composition methods or relying on old-fashioned empty thinking will not produce good works. Because today it is not just a matter of technique, the most important thing is to see how well it is combined with the thoughts and emotions of the soldiers and the masses, and how deep the understanding and experience of real life is. With such experience, plus the combination of technology and thought, the songs produced can be welcomed by the masses, and at least have that flavor.

　　3. Establish contact with music work comrades in various troops, localities, schools, and even those who have taken on other positions, especially with comrades in the troops, to solicit their experience and creations in serving the soldiers, and to collect and disseminate songs.

　　Naturally, our music work has achievements. If we deny this good side, then there would be no way to explain how the music work has been done in the past few years. However, we should also frankly admit the shortcomings, especially the fact that there is too little contact between ourselves. Generally speaking, in the past, music workers in the army and localities only met, talked, and exchanged experiences when some major conferences were held; but after the meeting, they no longer communicated with each other. Therefore, in the future, we should unite, organize, learn from the masses, and make some practical achievements for the soldiers and the people under the premise of the victorious counter-offensive of the self-defense war.

　　These are my personal immature opinions, and also my hopes. I hope that my opinions can meet with everyone.

　　来信之二
    先锋剧团  石岩文联负责同志：
    （前略）我觉得我们的音乐工作光靠这样不定期地向下面征求一番，是种临阵磨枪的办法，赶不上需要。因为前方将士每天做出了很多可歌可泣的英雄战绩，而我们的歌颂却远落于他们之后。为了从积极方面来检查改进这一工作，我建议：
    一、今后应有组织的了解我区过去老的音乐工作者有多少？现在新起的有多少？和他们建立联系，在帮助的原则下互相吸取经验，大胆地，大量地鼓励创作。
    二、号召音乐工作者，到部队、农村中去，特别是到自卫战争的前线去，学习体会兵的思想感情和他们的需要。坐在机关里搬作曲法，或老一套的凭空想，是写不出好作品来的。因为今天已不单是技术的问题，首要的是看和兵和群众的思想情绪结合的如何，对现实生活的了解与体验的深度如何，有了这样的体验，再加上技术、思想的结合，作出的歌子才能受到群众的欢迎，起码是有那个味。
    三、和各部队的、地方上的、学校的，甚至已做了别的岗位工作的音乐工作同志取得联系，特别是和部队上的同志们，征求他们在为兵服务上有何经验和创造，搜集成子，传播交流出去。
    自然，我们音乐工作是有成绩的。假如否认了这好的一面，那这几年的音乐工作是怎么做的，就无从说起了。但是，缺点我们也应坦白承认，特别是我们自己相互之间的联系太少，一般地说，过去军队上的，地方上的音乐工作者，只有在开什么大会时，才见见面，谈谈，交换些经验；但会后，又互不交流，互不联系了。所以今后应团结起来，组织起来，向群众学习，在自卫战争胜利的反攻前提下为兵、为人民实际做出一些成绩来。
    这是我个人的不成熟的意见，也是希望。希望有机会我的意见能和大家见见面。
