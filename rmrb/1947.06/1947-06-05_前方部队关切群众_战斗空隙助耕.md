　　Frontline Troops Care for the Masses
　　Assist with Farming During Combat Breaks
　　[This Newspaper's Report] The Logistics Command of the Pinghan Railway West, in coordination with the New Recruit ×× Supplement Regiment, is actively helping the local masses rush to plant cotton by utilizing breaks in the fighting. Each day, aside from leaving a small number of cadres and cooks to maintain daily work, the rest participate fully. They also established a crash cotton planting committee with district and village cadres to appropriately allocate labor. Taking streets as units, they were divided into mutual aid groups based on the number of acres to be planted, selecting experienced old farmers and skilled production leaders as the head and deputy head of the groups. During production, they used informal chats to publicize the past and present strength comparison between the enemy and ourselves, explain the government's burden policy, and educate the masses. Within three days, they carried water and planted 260 mu of cotton, planted 3.5 mu of corn, irrigated 108 mu of land, repaired 121 mu of land, weeded 59 mu of land, and dug 2,000 zhang of ditches. (Wen Wu, Shaoxing)
　　[Another Report] After the "Fangjiapo" troops arrived at a newly recovered village, they immediately mobilized the masses to return home for production and assisted in establishing the village government. Due to the urgency of spring plowing, they also organized assistance with farming. Every day, more than a hundred people were in the fields watering wheat and weeding, helping the masses with production. (Xiaohu)
　　[This Newspaper's Report] The Taihang First Military Sub-district troops vigorously helped with production in newly recovered areas. The Yuanshi Independent Battalion actively helped the masses in ×× Village and ×× Lou in the newly liberated area. The 6th squad of the 1st company alone helped the villagers dismantle a large through-room pit, build two livestock pens, load 14 carts of manure, pave a pigsty, and load and unload four carts of adobe. Yang Baokui from the 1st squad, who was too sick to eat, still helped the villagers push a waterwheel for half a day. Comrade Wang Maigen proposed: Not only should we help, but we must also cherish. Seeing too many small paths in the fields, he put up many signs prohibiting walking on small paths. After the Jingxing Independent Battalion was stationed in ×× Town in the newly liberated area, they helped the villagers carry water, chop grass, and clean the streets and courtyards. When an old lady couldn't carry firewood, our soldiers carried it home for her. From May 10th to 14th, for five days, a certain regiment assisted with farming in its stationed area (a newly recovered village), deploying 21 livestock, pulling water carts seven times, and hauling 240 carts of manure. In terms of manpower, they helped carry more than 980 loads of manure, pushed water carts for more than 30 workdays, and did more than 80 workdays of odd jobs. The regimental political commissar also personally helped the masses draw water and irrigate the fields. (Huaizhi)
