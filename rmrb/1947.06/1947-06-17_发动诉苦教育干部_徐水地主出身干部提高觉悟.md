Xinhua News Agency, Jin察冀 [Jin Cha Ji] 14th.  The Xushui County of Ji Xi recently held an expanded cadre meeting. By mobilizing cadres from backgrounds of farmhands, poor peasants and workers to "speak bitterness," cadres from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds were educated and their ideological concerns were dispelled. At the meeting, the speech of Comrade Niu Loruai, the district committee member who came from a farmhand background, was most educational for the cadres. He is 68 years old this year, has never been married. He became a child laborer at the age of thirteen and was overworked, causing him to become hunched over. He begged for food from a young age. Landlords often said that our family had dogs, and would not even give you leftover food. He did not eat his fill for nine years and often relied on eating green grass and wild vegetables to survive. He borrowed money from the landlord and could not repay it, so his house was torn down and his land was seized, and he was forced to wander. All the cadres were deeply moved after hearing this. Cadres from landlord backgrounds also spoke about their ideological transformations, enhanced their class consciousness, and gained a deep understanding of the old society where people exploited people. They unanimously expressed that they would resolutely and thoroughly implement land reform to help millions of people like Niu Loruai to stand up.

　　发动诉苦教育干部
    徐水地主出身干部提高觉悟
    【新华社晋察冀十四日电】冀西徐水县顷召开扩大干部会议，以发动倔、贫农、工人出身的干部诉苦的办法，教育了地主、富农出身的干部，解除了他们的思想顾虑。会上，雇农出身的区委牛洛瑞同志的发言对干部教育最大。他今年六十八岁了，还未结过婚，十三岁时当小工劳动过度弯了腰，从小讨饭吃，地主常说我们家中有狗，有剩饭也不给你吃。他九年没吃过饱饭，常靠吃青草野菜过日子，借了地主的钱还不起，被拆了房，夺了地，就流落在外了。全体干部听了深受感动。地主出身的干部，也谈出了他们的思想转变，提高了阶级觉悟，对人吃人的旧社会，有了深刻认识。一致表示要坚决彻底实现土地改革，使千百万像牛洛瑞的人翻身。
