Yubei 32nd Troops
    Hold Meeting of Meritorious Servants
    Summarize Experiences, Prepare for a Major Counteroffensive
    [This newspaper's Yubei Frontline Fourteenth Dispatch] On the morning of the eighth, the inaugural Meritorious Servants Congress of the People's Liberation Army's 32nd Troops officially commenced amidst the resounding booms of saluting cannons and the symphony of heroic songs. The venue was located within a tall white poplar forest in a certain village where they were stationed, its interior decorated with solemn splendor, surrounded by colorful congratulatory banners, pennants, slogans, and colored cloth paintings of various battles. At the entrance of the venue hung a ten-foot-tall, five-colored giant portrait of Chairman Mao. In front of this image of the people's savior, the masses thronged, packed like sardines, from morning till night. At 7:30 AM, when the majestic singing from the congress's loudspeakers ceased, the chairman reported on the significance of the meeting after meritorious servants Ren Xiaoxiang, Zhou Maoxiang, and various military and political leaders were appointed to the congress's presidium. He emphasized that this Meritorious Servants Congress was to summarize the achievements of the past ten months of self-defense warfare and to welcome the counteroffensive. He hoped that all the meritorious servants would lead the masses well and fight to swiftly overthrow the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Following this, the highest Party committee of the troops announced that 228 soldiers and cadres, including Zhou Maoxiang, Ren Xiaoxiang, Qu Hongfa, Wei Guohua, Fan Zhiping, and Zhang Sheng, were each awarded major, special, and minor merits once. Additionally, 61 units such as squads, platoons, companies, and battalions were collectively awarded merits. At this moment, songs rose in the venue, and applause thundered. The leaders of the troops and local people's representatives personally pinned red flowers of merit on the chests of the meritorious servants. Subsequently, Guo, the deputy political commissar of the troops, and General Liu Bocheng delivered speeches. In the report of the commander of the troops, in addition to clearly pointing out the brilliant achievements of recent months, he emphasized: In order to welcome the counteroffensive and swiftly end Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous rule, the meritorious servants must lead the masses to fight hard and strive for even greater merit; vigorously help the masses carry out land reform, accurately grasp financial and economic policies, and promote the fine tradition of hard struggle.
    [This newspaper's Yubei Frontline Fourteenth Dispatch] This newspaper's reporter Ke Gang reports: The People's Liberation Army 32nd Troops' Meritorious Servants Congress, which grandly opened on the morning of the eighth, after outstanding meritorious servants reported typical combat achievements to the congress yesterday (the ninth), and all meritorious servants were awarded prizes this morning, leaders, guests, and representatives of meritorious servants delivered speeches, and the meritorious servants passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the congress announced its complete closure. The reporter witnessed the entire process of the two-day meeting. Among them, the item of meritorious servants reporting typical combat achievements was the most exciting. When Ren Laibao, a reconnaissance meritorious servant who first took the stage, gave a vivid factual explanation of his three times penetrating the tiger's den, capturing Chiang's troops alive, and obtaining valuable intelligence, and used his extremely concise experience—"calmness, decisiveness, resourcefulness, bravery, improved technology, more use of brains, and reliance on the masses"—as his concluding remarks, the applause from the audience was prolonged and unceasing. Then, the famous meritorious servant Zhou Maoxiang, nicknamed "Tiger Fighter," with his eyebrows dancing and arms waving, immediately took the stage to report the earth-shattering scene when he was blocking the enemy in Guanzhuang. He said: "At that time, we only had two companies, but we repelled the five-day offensive of three regiments of Chiang's American-equipped direct lineage Fifth Army. My comrades and I fought during the day and repaired fortifications at night, fighting bloodily day and night without closing our eyes, but none of us felt sleepy; that's how we defeated the crazy enemy. This time I killed or wounded more than fifty enemies." At this point, Zhou Maoxiang couldn't help but shout loudly: "Now we must prepare for a major counteroffensive. Our southern comrades who have been liberated must not forget our hometowns which are still under Chiang Kai-shek's tyrannical rule. Only by ending Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous civil war dictatorship as soon as possible and quickly implementing land reform, will everyone have food to eat." As soon as he finished speaking, Hou Changjiang, a meritorious servant of a certain third company, suddenly stood up and made a temporary motion. He represented the entire squad in proposing a revolutionary competition to Zhou Maoxiang. His conditions were: in combat, guarantee to lead the masses, help everyone, everyone perform meritorious service, and seize more cannons; do propaganda at any time and place, and everyone help the masses to turn themselves over. Zhou Maoxiang immediately stood up and accepted the challenge. At this point, the atmosphere of the congress suddenly became tense, individuals and individuals, collectives and collectives, challenged one another, and the heroic words shocked the audience. The heated scene was really hard to describe.

　　豫北三二部队
    举行功臣大会
    总结经验准备大反攻
    【本报豫北前线十四日电】八日上午，人民解放军三二部队第一届功臣大会，于隆隆礼炮和英雄歌曲的交响声中，正式启幕。会场设在驻地某村之高大白杨林内，内部装璜庄严辉煌，四周环布五光十色的贺幛、锦旗、标语，及各个战役的彩色布画。会场门口挂着丈余高的毛主席五彩巨像，在这幅人民救星的像前，自晨至晚群众挤的水泄不通。七时半，当大会播音机内之雄壮歌声中止，通过功臣任笑祥、周茂祥及各军政首长为大会主席团后，主席报告开会意义，他着重说明这次功臣大会是为了总结十个月来的自卫战绩、迎接反攻，希望全体功臣好好带领群众，为迅速卖国的蒋介石统治而战斗。接着该部最高党委即宣布周茂祥、任笑祥、曲洪法、魏国华、范治平、张升等战士干部二百廿八名，分别各记大功、特功、小功一次。另有集体记功之班排连营等六十一单位。此时会场歌声扬起，掌声雷动。该部首长和当地人民代表亲手将功臣红花戴在功臣们的胸前。继由该部郭副政委与刘伯承将军致词。在该部司令员的报告中，除明确指出近月来的辉煌战绩外，并着重指出：为了迎接反攻，迅速结束蒋介石的卖国统治，功臣们必须做到带领群众努力作战，争取功上加功；大力帮助群众进行土地改革，确切掌握财经政策，发扬艰苦奋斗的优良传统。
    【本报豫北前线十四日电】本报记者柯岗报导：人民解放军三二部队功臣大会，自八日晨隆重启幕以来，经昨日（九日）出色功臣向大会报告典型战绩，今晨全体功臣受奖，首长来宾及功臣代表分别致词，功臣通过致毛主席、朱总司令电后，大会宣布完满闭幕。记者目击两日来全部会议进程，其中功臣报告典型战绩一项最为精彩，当首先登台的侦察功臣任来保，将他三次深入虎穴、活捉蒋军，取得宝贵情报做生动事实说明，并以其极为简要的经验——“沉着、果断、机智、勇猛、提高技术、多用脑筋、依靠群众”等作为他的结语时，全场掌声经久不息。于是著名功臣外号“打虎将”的周茂祥眉飞色舞，挥动双臂，立即登台报告他在官庄阻击时之惊天动地的情景，他说：“当时我们只有两个连，但却打退了美械嫡系蒋记第五军三个团的五天进攻。我和我的伙伴们，白天打仗，夜晚修工事，日夜血战不曾合眼，但是我们谁也没有睡意；就是这样，我们战胜了疯狂的敌人。这次我毙伤敌人五十多个。”至此，周茂祥情不自禁的大声的呼喊：“现在我们要准备大反攻啦，咱们被解放过来的南方同志们不要忘记咱们的家乡。还在蒋介石暴政统治下面，只有早日结束蒋介石卖国内战的独裁统治，赶快实现土地改革，人人才有饭吃。”他的话刚一落地，某三连功臣侯长江突然起立，提出临时动议，他代表全班向周茂祥提出革命竞赛，他的条件是：在战斗中保证带领群众，帮助大家，人人立功，多缴大炮；随时随地做到进出宣传，人人帮助群众翻身。周茂祥立即起立应战。至此，大会情绪顿呈紧张，个人与个人，集体与集体，纷纷挑战，英雄豪语震撼全场，热烈情景实难言喻。
