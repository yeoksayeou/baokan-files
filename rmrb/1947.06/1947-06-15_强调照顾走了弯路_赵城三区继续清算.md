    Emphasizing Care Went Astray
    Zhao Cheng Third District Continues Land Reform
    [Report from our newspaper in Taiyue, 13th] In the land reform, cadres in the third district of Zhao Cheng emphasized taking care of landlords and restricting the struggle of the masses, causing the mass movement in the entire district to take a wrong turn. Although farmers in the entire district recovered 2,548 mu of land, they were not truly emancipated. They wanted to continue the struggle against the landlords, but feared violating policy; if they didn't struggle, they were even more afraid of the feudal forces retaliating. The masses' morale was low, but the cadres thought that the landlords' land had been distributed, and that was almost enough, and it was time to shift to production or anti-espionage work. After the county discovered this problem, it convened an expanded cadre meeting, proposing to rely on the poor peasants, go deep into the lower levels, and boldly hand over the policies to the masses. Houdaojue Village took the lead in launching a struggle, and more than 500 people, regardless of eating or sleeping, fought against landlords and local bullies such as Wang Chengzhang. From then on, the masses in each village said, "There are still people like those in Daogjue in our village!" In less than half a month, villages such as Chaicunbao and Shuangtou also re-ignited the struggle. Yang Fengzhi, a female hero who had turned over in Daogjue, said proudly: "In February, they gave me three mu of land, but I didn't feel happy. This time, we poor people stood up and overthrew feudalism, and we are truly liberated!"

　　强调照顾走了弯路
    赵城三区继续清算
    【本报太岳十三日电】赵城三区干部在土地改革中，强调照顾地主，限制群众斗争，使全区群众运动走了弯路。全区农民虽收回两千五百四十八亩土地，但没有翻了身。想继续对地主斗争，又怕违犯政策；不斗呢，更怕封建势力再来报复。群众情绪消沉，干部却认为地主土地分配了，也就差不多了，应该转入生产或反特务。县上发觉此问题后，又召开扩干会议，提出依靠贫农，深入下层，大胆将政策交给群众。后道觉村首先开展斗争，五百余群众皆不顾吃饭睡觉，斗倒了王成章等地主奸霸。从此各村群众都说：“像道觉这样的人，我们村里还有哩！”不到半月，柴村堡、双头等村皆重新爆发了斗争。道觉翻身女英雄杨风芝挺着胸脯说：“二月里给了我三亩地，我倒不觉得高兴，这一下我们穷人出了头，打倒了封建，我们才算真翻了身！”
