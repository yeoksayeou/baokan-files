　　Old Liberated Areas Support New Liberated Areas to Protect Wheat Harvest and Distribute Land
    Originally Obtained Guerrilla Warfare Victory Begins to Unfold
    [Reported by This Newspaper] After the Shiyuan Battle, most of the Yuan (shi) and Huo (lu) areas were liberated by us. The masses in the newly recovered areas are joyfully carrying out the anti-traitor revenge and land reform, and organizing militia forces to protect the interests of the masses. However, recently, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops have constantly come out to loot and sabotage. In order to support the mass movement and protect the wheat harvest, in addition to the support of troops and militia from the old liberated areas to Yuan and Huo, and combining with local armed activities, a mass guerrilla war has been launched:
    1. Mass Explosions: In Yuan, Gao, Huo, Zan and other counties, local militia and mobile explosion teams and explosion groups of supporting militia are active around the enemy strongholds in Yuan and Huo, burying landmines all the way to Yuan City, Leguan Railway Station, and Dongying, Sijiazhuang, Gangshang in Huolu.... forming a minefield, and the enemy is being bombed everywhere. When the enemy went to Xizhang Village in Gaoyi to loot, eight mines blew up, and the enemy dared not enter the village. Nine mines were buried at Tietun Railway Station, and the enemy stepped on four of them, killing and wounding three enemy soldiers. Four mines were buried from Huolu to Dongli, killing three enemy intelligence officers. Two mines were buried from Zanhuang to Xihantai, wounding one enemy and killing one enemy. The Gaoyi mobile explosion group buried a total of fourteen mines weighing twenty kilograms each outside the city. When the enemy discovered the mines and went to remove them, one enemy was killed and three enemy soldiers were wounded. Now the enemy clearly sees our landmines and dares not remove them. The active militia and local masses have recognized the power of landmines. The militia self-defense team in Xizhang Village, Gaoyi, while watching the waterwheel, also made stone mines and buried more than two hundred stone mines and landmines every night. According to incomplete statistics, from May to now, eighteen enemy soldiers have been wounded and four enemy soldiers have been killed by explosions.
    2. Combination of Sniper Fire and Tunnel Warfare: In the liberated villages around Yuan City, there are generally tunnels and bunkers, and with full preparation, continuous anti-looting village battles and tunnel warfare are carried out. On May 30, more than ten enemies went to Dahuang, Yuanshi, to rob wheat. Militia Zhang Zhongqiu, Li Hongzi, etc., killed one enemy and wounded two enemy soldiers in the tunnel. On the 21st, the enemy went to Songcao to rob again. Six militiamen prevented the enemy's looting in the fortifications. In the bunker, Wang Xiaozhu alone killed and wounded two enemy soldiers. The enemy used fire to smoke, but we were fully prepared and not afraid at all. When the enemy arrived at Wangsong, they were driven to the north of the village by militia sniper fire. The Zanhuang Working Team collapsed the enemy's military sentry Liu Yin with sniper fire in Beiyan, killing three enemies... The ground and underground sniper and sparrow warfare has killed twenty-two enemies, wounded twenty-one enemies, and captured two enemies.
    3. Peasants Everywhere are One Family: The militia supporting the new liberated areas protects the wheat harvest in Yuan and Huo as if it were in their own village, not only launching sniper and explosion wars to combat enemy grain looting, but also helping the masses with the harvest. The Zanhuang militia working team in Duzhuang and Youzheng, Yuanshi, helped the masses harvest forty-three mu of wheat. While helping the masses harvest wheat, they found the enemy coming to rob, and immediately killed one enemy and drove the enemy back. Now the old liberated areas are preparing to support the new liberated areas ××× to support the seizure and arm the masses in the new liberated areas to further launch a mass guerrilla war in the new liberated areas and behind enemy lines.

　　老区支援新区保麦分田
    元获游击战胜利展开
    【本报讯】石元战役后，元（氏）获（鹿）大部地区为我解放，新收复区群众正在欢笑的进行着反奸复仇土地改革，组织民兵武装保卫群众利益。但近来蒋伪军不断出来抢劫破坏。为了给群运撑腰与保卫麦收，除部队与老区民兵支援元获，并结合了当地武装活动，开展了群众性的游击战争：
    一、群众性的爆炸：元、高、获、赞等县都有本地民兵与支援民兵的飞行爆炸队爆炸组分别活跃在元获敌人据点周围，一直把地雷埋到了元氏城乐关车站及获鹿之东营、寺家庄、岗上………等地，布成了雷网，敌人到处挨炸。敌到高邑西张村劫掠，八个雷炸的敌不敢进村。铁屯车站埋雷九个，敌踏响四个，毙伤敌三人。获鹿到东里埋雷四个，炸敌情报员三人。赞皇到西韩台埋雷两个，伤敌一，毙敌一。高邑飞行爆炸组在城外埋二十斤重的雷共十四个，敌发觉去起雷时炸死敌一，伤敌三。现在敌明看着我们地雷不敢去起。活动之民兵及当地群众认识了地雷威力，高邑西张村民兵自卫队群众一面看水车一面打石雷，每晚上埋二百多个石雷和地雷。据不完全的统计，从五月到现在炸伤敌十八人，炸死敌四人。
    二、冷枪地道工事结合：在元氏城周围已解放的村庄，大都有地道地堡工事，并有充分准备，不断的开展反抢掠村落战、地道战。五月卅日十余敌人到元氏大红抢麦，民兵张中秋、李红子等在地道内毙敌一，伤敌二。二十一日又敌到宋曹抢劫，六个民兵在工事里阻止敌人的掠夺，在地堡内王小助一人毙伤敌二人，敌用火薰，我有充分准备丝毫不怕。敌人到王宋，被民兵冷枪赶到村北。赞皇武工队在北岩冷枪冲垮了敌人军哨刘银一人，毙敌三名。……开展了地上地下的冷枪麻雀战，已毙敌二十二，伤敌二十一，俘敌二。
    三、天下农民是一家：支援新区的民兵在元获保卫麦收和在自己村一样，不但开展冷枪爆炸战打击敌抢粮，并帮助群众抢收。只赞皇民兵武工队在元氏杜庄、酉正，即帮助群众割麦子四十三亩。在帮助群众割麦时，发现敌人来抢，当即毙敌一，将敌击退。现在老区正在准备支援新区群众×××支抢，把新区群众武装起来，进一步开展新区与敌后群众性游击战争。（张国华、吕聪瑞）
