Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 7th. TASS Berlin dispatch: The "New Germany" newspaper reporter reported from Halle: The joint meeting of mine workers' unions in various occupied areas of Germany was held at the end of last month and passed the following main resolutions: The Second Joint Conference of Mine Workers' Unions in various occupied areas of Germany was shocked by the published Hoover Plan. (Note: US isolationist leader Hoover suggested in late May that the United States should conclude a separate peace treaty with Germany and Japan.) The purpose of this plan is to conclude a separate peace treaty with the western regions of Germany. The meeting perceived in this plan the intention of monopoly capital to undermine the Potsdam Resolution, and to systematically and deliberately implement the partition of Germany; and this partition endangers the survival of Germany and breeds the threat of future wars. We—the representatives of 600,000 German miners—call on all German trade unions to express their opinions on this point. The plans of foreign monopoly capitalists force German miners not only to increase coal production to overcome the coal shortage and develop the entire German economy, but also to safeguard the unity of Germany and peace. The meeting also called on the mine workers' unions in various occupied areas to carry out the following struggles: to eliminate and dissolve Konzerns, Trusts, Cartels, and employer alliances, to exclude all reactionaries and fascists from the management departments of industry, and, especially important, to demand that natural resources and mining agencies be nationalized and placed under the control of the people. The meeting also urged increased industrial production for peaceful needs, the implementation of land reform throughout Germany, a single agricultural plan, etc. Regarding the proposal of the Mine Workers' Union of the Soviet-occupied area, the meeting decided to establish an organizing committee, composed of two representatives from each occupied area, who will engage in organizational work related to the unified German trade union movement.
