　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 4th: The Northeast Democratic Allied Army completely annihilated one division of the Chiang army's 60th Army's Provisional 21st Division and one battalion of the 182nd Division yesterday (3rd). On the 30th of last month, this division secretly fled from Hailong and Chaoyang Town at night. The Democratic Allied Army immediately divided its forces to intercept and encircle them. After three days and nights of fierce pursuit, the division fled in all directions and had nowhere to go. Failing to escape to Changchun, they turned towards Jilin to the east. Finally, yesterday, they were completely annihilated in the Jichang Town area, southeast of Shuangyang City. In Shuanghe Town, southwest of Jilin, one battalion of the 60th Army's 182nd Division, which came to aid from Jilin, was completely annihilated. The results of the battle are still being investigated. Note: This division was reorganized after its 63rd Regiment, the mountain artillery battalion directly under the division, and one battalion each from the 61st and 62nd Regiments were annihilated during the third invasion of the Liaodong Liberated Area in mid-February to early March of this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, Urgent Telegram, 4th: On the Meihe front, a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered the important coal mining center of Xian County yesterday (3rd) at 2:00 AM, capturing over 1,500 enemy troops. On the 1st, the Democratic Allied Army launched an attack on the defending enemy's Youth Army Second Division. Upon contact, the enemy retreated in a panic, abandoning their solid fortifications with electric fences at 2:00 PM, fleeing in two routes, west and north. The Democratic Allied Army immediately annihilated all the enemy fleeing west, capturing over 1,500 prisoners. The enemy fleeing north is also being pursued in separate directions. Thus, the Democratic Allied Army has completely controlled the 300-li railway line from the outskirts of Siping to Meihekou.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, Urgent Telegram, 4th: On the Siping front, a unit of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army recovered Kaiyuan County and the railway station yesterday (3rd) morning. The more than 2,000 defending enemy troops fled south in the dense fog at 7:00 AM and are currently being pursued. Note: Kaiyuan is located more than 200 li northeast of Shenyang and is the junction of the main line of the Changchun Railway and the Kaiyuan-Xifeng branch line. It is located south of the Qinghe River and is an important support point for protecting the north of Shenyang. Thus, the Democratic Allied Army has completely controlled the 170-li section of the main railway line between Siping and Kaiyuan and the 90-li Kaiyuan-Xifeng branch line. (Attached image)
