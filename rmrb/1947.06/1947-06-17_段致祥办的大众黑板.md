　　Duan Zhixiang's Popular Blackboard
　　Wang Yi
　　Duan Zhixiang is an elementary school teacher in Xisiyi Village, Second District of Jincheng. The popular blackboard he runs has played a significant role in promoting and guiding the central tasks of the village at various periods. During the commendation session at the Jincheng County government's meeting of all senior and junior teachers in mid-May, everyone agreed that his popular blackboard was the best. What he writes on the blackboard are mostly quick rhymes compiled from timely collected materials within the village.

　　At the beginning of this year's spring plowing and mutual aid work, some people were reluctant to participate in mutual aid, saying, "Who doesn't know how to farm? It's easier to farm on your own." Upon hearing this, he wrote on the popular blackboard:

　　Come quickly, come quickly! Mutual aid and labor exchange is a good method for both men and women.
　　In the past, everyone farmed individually, falling down and picking themselves up.
　　From now on, mutual aid and labor exchange will be a great cooperation, everyone united as one.
　　With more people, the power of production is greater, not even afraid of encountering wolves.
　　With more people, strength is strong, grains and miscellaneous crops are planted early.
　　With more people, ideas are better, corn, cotton, all kinds of crops are called heroes.
　　The land fears three hoeings, weeds have no way out.
　　Seven people, three and a half pairs, can do the work of ten.
　　Saving labor and saving food,
　　Taking time to earn money and pay the burden."

　　Everyone gathered around to read it and said: Mutual aid is good. Mutual aid team leader Li Zhixiang said: We must do a good job in our mutual aid team. However, the women were still unwilling to participate. A few who did participate didn't have much enthusiasm, saying: "The revolution has turned us upside down into the fields!" Upon hearing this, he immediately wrote another quick rhyme on the popular blackboard:

　　In the dark society of the past, women had no status, their position was lowered to the bottom,
　　Serving others first, eating last, others eat meat, we gnaw bones,
　　Bound feet ruined toes, faces smeared with official powder, looking prematurely white.
　　Daughters-in-law didn't dare raise their heads when scolded by their mothers-in-law, husbands would turn their faces and punch them.
　　A belly full of grievances hidden inside, crying and weeping endlessly.
　　Chairman Mao led the women out, raising their status and lifting their heads.
　　Unbinding feet and cutting hair, speaking out bitterness and turning over to take the lead.
　　Breaking through sentimentality and settling accounts completely, joining organizations and women's associations.
　　Engaging in production, spinning yarn, driving carts, the Communist Party's grace is firmly remembered in our hearts.
　　Making army shoes and handing them in, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, receiving steamed buns.
　　Rushing to spring plowing and carrying hoes, self-reliance and regeneration with enthusiasm.
　　Being a clever woman and going to the fields, having enough to eat and wear, and having fun.

　　After it was written, everyone read it everywhere, which promoted Zhao Hai, Chong Hai, Chong Hai's wife, Lai Yun's wife, and the four volunteered to form a mutual aid group with great enthusiasm. In five days, the four of them grabbed four mu of land and carried fifty baskets of ash and slag. Rui Rui and Ruan Chi, seeing how lively it was, also joined the mutual aid group. Duan Zhixiang, seeing the enthusiasm of these women in mutual aid, immediately wrote a commendation on the popular blackboard. The women worked with greater enthusiasm, and now ninety-six women in the whole village have joined the mutual aid groups.

　　段致祥办的大众黑板
    王毅
    段致祥是晋城二区西四义村的小学教员。他所办的大众黑板，对村里各个时期的中心工作都起了很大的推动指导作用。在五月中旬晋城县政府召开全县高初级教员会议上评功时，大家公认他办的大众黑板最好。他在黑板上所写的多是及时搜集村内的材料编成的快板。
    在今年春耕互助工作开始时，有些人不想互助说：“谁还不会种个地，自己种自己的还随便些”。他听到这个反映，就在大众黑板上写道：
    快来吧，快来吧！男女互助变工好办法。
    过去做地各顾各，自己跌倒自己爬。
    今后互助变工大合作，大家团结成一疙瘩。
    人多生产力量大，碰见野狼也不怕。
    人多力气壮，五谷杂粮早种上。
    人多计策高，金皇后，棉花，各样庄稼称英豪。
    地怕三张锄，草莠没出路。
    七人三对半，做活能顶十人干。
    又省工来又省饭，
    抽出工夫赚钱交负担。”
    大家围着看了都说：互助好。互助组长李致祥说：非把咱的互助组搞好不行。可是妇女还不愿参加，有少数参加了，也是劲头不大，说：“翻身把咱翻到地里头来了！”他一听到，随时又在大众黑板上写出一个快板：
    过去社会黑暗妇女没来头，把个地位降底坐坑头，
    做在人前吃后头，人家吃肉咱啃骨头，
    缠足攒坏脚指头，脸擦官粉赛白头。
    婆婆骂的不抬头，男人反脸又打两拳头。
    一肚冤枉藏在肚里头，哭哭啼啼没过头。
    毛主席领导妇女出了头，提高地位抬起头。
    放大脚来剪了头，诉苦翻身起带头。
    打破情面把帐算到头，参加组织妇女会里头。
    生产纺花坐车头，共产党恩典牢记在心头。
    做军鞋交到头，拥军优抗拿馒头。
    突击春耕扛锄头，自力更生有劲头。
    当个巧妇下到地里头，有吃有穿有兴头。
    写出后，大家看了到处圪念，就推动了召孩，充孩，充孩的媳妇，来运老婆，四人自愿结合互助起来，劲头非常大。在五天内，四人就抢了四亩地，抬了灰渣五十筐。锐锐、软翅看见人家闹的红，自己也参加了互助组。段致祥看见这几个妇女互助劲头大，当即在大众黑板上写出表扬了一番。妇女们干的劲头大起来，现在全村妇女有九十六人都参加互助组。
