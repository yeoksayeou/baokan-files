　　Combat Hero Cai Qingshen
　　A Banner of Courage Combined with Technique

　　Hero Portrait
　　Cai Qingshen is a banner of courage combined with technique, well-known in our brigade, and a combat hero of many campaigns. To understand why he is brave and why he is proficient in technique, I had several conversations with him:
　　"Without a definite purpose, you can't complete the task. Just being courageous isn't enough; lacking courage isn't enough either." He always said this firmly after finishing a story.
　　"When the work is easy, everyone seems brave. But when it's difficult, that's another story." He continued to add.
　　"Ah! Are you saying that only by taking the lead in being brave can you encourage others to be brave?"
　　"You can't just tell people to be blindly brave," he answered powerfully.
　　"Then, according to you, what should be done to be considered good?" I also raised my voice to ask.
　　"Taking the lead in being brave is first, figuring out ideas is second." He paused and said this sentence.
　　"Now there are fewer old soldiers here. It's not easy to get the new recruits to calm down." He sighed and said to himself again.
　　He also had a habit of never letting his hands rest. Now I saw his hands fiddling with something, making a little noise.
　　"What are you doing?" I asked.
　　He opened his hands. In his right palm was a gun's bolt component, and his left hand held the gun's butt plate. With a few flicks of his fingers, "snap," the parts instantly became a bolt, and he immediately pressed it onto the receiver. From disassembling to installing the bolt, it only took a minute. He was as skilled as an old lady winding thread, completely in control.
　　He is most skilled in the meticulous organization of platoon and squad combat actions. He often said, "When leading a squad or a platoon, you must first know who is truly working and who isn't."
　　During the Battle of Chuwang, the eight-person ladder team, under his leadership, were all numbered from front to back, left to right, and their positions were determined.
　　I have known Comrade Cai Qingshen for two days. Outwardly, we are already familiar with each other. He is twenty-seven years old. His rectangular, dark face has bright and spirited eyes, and his large lips often emit a pure smile. He is from Haolu Village, Julu, but rarely has a local accent. Since joining the army, he has been elected a combat hero five times and wounded three times.

　　A Piece of History
　　Afterward, I asked him to report his history.
　　"I joined the army for the first time in 1939," he said. "At first, I participated in the county's armed forces department. I was only seventeen or eighteen then." Later, the team couldn't persevere, so I went to escape the famine with my family.
　　"In the spring of '41, when the wheat was almost ready to be harvested! The family returned from escaping the famine, and before we could even settle down, Li Laoming, the head of the district maintenance association, began to have bad intentions towards us."
　　"Qingshen's father, you've been away for a year. See, I haven't demolished your house or ruined your land, but you have to pay for this year's arrears," the head of the district maintenance association said to Qingshen's father, pursing his long mustache.
　　This Li Laoming was eloquent and capable. Since he became the head of the association, he had gone from a landless peasant to the leading household in the village.
　　Laoming and the village maintenance officer Lei Yongqing had already discussed it. "You take his threshing ground first, and I'll take his wheat field."
　　"Laoming! You know, the threshing ground belongs to my second uncle. He hasn't returned from escaping the famine yet!" Qingshen's father said to Laoming.
　　"Getting through this cheap year, spending this protects you from both eating and arrears. What's wrong with that?"
　　"No! It's really not okay! Laoming."
　　"You be in charge! You can resist when the Japanese come. Anyway, if you don't spend it, you won't be able to get through your difficulties."
　　"The adults and children don't want to!"
　　"I'll give you an extra hundred yuan!" Laoming laughed... "That's it, take the money and go. I'll take care of this little matter for you." He waved his hand and pushed the peasant out.
　　The next morning, Qingshen's father didn't close his eyes all night, and tears filled his pillow.
　　"We have to spend it, whether we want to or not." The old man said to Qingshen, weeping.
　　"Why did you take someone else's order? Return it!"
　　"Can't return it..."
　　"Let me return it." Qingshen stood up, stretched out a hand, and rushed out.
　　After Qingshen argued with Laoming, the two families became enemies. They forcibly took the threshing ground and six mu of land, and besides the money given for the order, the rest was all charged to the arrears account.
　　"Don't cause any more trouble for me, go away!" One day his father said to him.
　　Comrade Qingshen then joined the county brigade. This was in January 1942.

　　Tempering and Progress
　　During the Battle of Hengshui the year before last, Cai Qingshen was still serving as a squad leader. He and two squads were tasked with the assault team's mission. Although he was also the first to climb the city, there were many shortcomings when reviewing it.
　　The machine gun fired intensely. The second platoon leader led the ladder team of six people, heading upwards, needing to cross a deep ditch and climb over a wall several feet high.
　　The gunfire became more intense. They were running, and only reached the edge of the ditch, but everyone was out of breath.
　　"It's too fierce in front!" The platoon leader said, turning his head.
　　"We still have to charge, platoon leader." Cai Qingshen said, straightening his body.
　　"But we'll suffer great losses!" The platoon leader said hesitantly.
　　"No! We have to charge even if we suffer losses, charge quickly, whoever doesn't charge is a coward!" Qingshen couldn't help but raise his shovel and shout.
　　At this time, the soldiers were putting down the ladder and scattering in all directions. He raised his shovel and called the soldiers back, saying, "Quickly carry the ladder. There's no danger when you get to the fort wall."
　　The soldiers returned, but some were still carrying the ladder slowly.
　　"Go, let's pull the ladder away." He said to a soldier next to him and immediately propped the ladder up. The two of them were the first to climb onto the city wall, and a group of people also rushed up and occupied the city wall.
　　Back in the team, he thought and thought: "Doing it this way won't work! If you're going to charge, charge to the foot of the fort wall. Don't hesitate halfway. The ladder team must also be well organized, numbered, and the cadres must not only take the lead in being brave but also think of a good plan first." After that, Cai Qingshen became a well-known expert in attacking fortified positions.

　　Climbing Chuwang
　　In the Battle of Chuwang, the company-level cadre, leading six platoon leaders, peeked at the enemy's fortifications and turned around to ask?
　　"Qingshen, what do you think of the enemy?"
　　"Two rows of abatis, the wall is more than a person high. I can't see any clearer than that."
　　"What about you?" He asked others.
　　"Can't see clearly at all?"
　　"You're not thorough in looking at the terrain!" The instructor said critically.
　　"Alright! Then the task of assault will be given to your second platoon." The company commander said to Cai Qingshen. Back in the platoon, Qingshen walked and pondered, how exactly should he complete the task?
　　"First, set up the ladder." He made up his mind, and then called the six soldiers of the ladder team and led them away.
　　"Remember to take the forks for lifting the ladder."
　　He walked to the ladder beside the ditch and frowned for a long time. The ladder was so short, how could it reach the fort?
　　"Go back and carry that big ladder!" He ordered again, and walked toward the big ladder. The soldiers followed behind.
　　"Who dares to go up!" He looked up at the big ladder on the ditch and shouted.
　　"I'll go!" A soldier said.
　　"Don't show your head, use this rope to tie it up and pull it down." He said, while using a shovel to dig a gap in the ditch.
　　The big ladder stopped at the waist of the ditch.
　　"No, push it to the edge of the abatis in front! Let it be shaded, don't expose the target," Qingshen said.
　　After the ladder was transported, he thought again: "It's not easy to cross the water, this deep water, dozens of sorghum stalks can't fill it!" An idea came to him: "Let's build this small ladder into a bridge."
　　He dug a shelter with a shovel from the side, stood there himself, and pushed the wooden ladder out from the ditch mouth.
　　Bullets flew, shooting straight at the ditch mouth, but because he had a shelter, none of the six people were hit. Everyone said, "The platoon leader really has a way."
　　Afterward, they got busy, building a bridge, covering it with door panels, and digging steps to go up the second ditch, pulling the abatis out of the way. Every step was a discussion of ideas, busy until dusk. They only returned when the company headquarters announced the assembly.
　　"How is it?" The company commander asked.
　　"We've built the bridge and pulled out the abatis, just run fast! Being the first to climb the city is no problem," Qingshen said with a smile.
　　Sure enough, the Battle of Chuwang ended, and his company became the first company to climb the city in all breakthroughs, and only one person was injured.
　　Back, Qingshen said to the people in the company: "As long as you intend to complete the task, there is nothing that cannot be completed." It is this kind of practical spirit that makes him a banner of courage combined with technique.

　　战斗英雄蔡庆申
    一面勇敢与技术结合的旗帜

    英雄画像
    蔡庆申是我旅熟知的勇敢与技术结合的旗帜，历届的战斗英雄。为了要知道他为什么勇敢，为什么精通技术，我同他作了几次谈话：
    “没有一定的目的，你就完不成任务，光勇敢不沾，不勇敢也不沾。”每当说完一段故事，他总是这样肯定的说。
    “工作容易干时，谁也落个勇敢，困难时，那就不好说了。”他继续补充的说。
    “呵！你说的是，只要自己带头勇敢，才能叫别人也勇敢吗？”
    “不能叫别人瞎勇敢，”他强有力的答道。
    “那么，依你说要怎样做才算好呢？”我也放高嗓子来问。
    “带头勇敢算第一，捉摸出主意算第二。”他顿了一顿，说了这句。
    “现在这里老人少了，叫新战士们大伙都沉住气，那可不是容易事。”他嘘了一口气又自言自语的说。
    他还有一种习惯，似乎双手从来不肯停息，现在我看到他的一双手又象在摆弄着什么，并发出了一点响声。
    “你在干什么啦？”我问。
    他把双手敞开，在他右手心上放着枪机零件，左手托着枪底板，只见几个手指头一动弹，“拍”的一声，几个零件瞬刻变成了枪机，又马上按上了枪膛，从拆卸到装上枪机，只不过一分钟，真和老太太缠线蛋一样，完全操纵自如。
    他是最精于对排班战斗的动作细密组织的，他常说：“带一个班，一个排，你就得先知道，那人真实干，那人不能。”
    这次打楚旺战斗中，八个人的梯子组，在他的领导下，都一一的从前后左右编了号，并确定了位置。
    我和蔡庆申同志，已经认识两天了，外表上，我们彼此都已熟习，他今年二十七岁，在他那长方形深黑色的脸上目光转动的炯炯有神，大嘴唇里，不时发出纯真的笑声，他是巨鹿郝鲁村人，但很少本地口音，参军以来，五次当选战斗英雄，三次负伤。
    一段历史
    以后，我就请他报告历史了。
    “我是一九三九年第一回参军”，他说：“当初参加县里武装科，那时我才十七八哩。”后来，队伍不能坚持，我便和家人一同去逃荒。
    “四一年春天，麦子都快能割啦！一家人逃荒回来，还没站住脚哩，区维持会长李老名，便对咱起了坏心了。”
    “庆申爹，你在外边一年了，你看，没拆你的宅子，也没毁你的地，可是你得拿这一年的差，区维持会长噘一下他那两撇长胡对庆申父亲说。
    这个李老名，能说又会道，从他当了会长，他由个无地户，变成了村里边的首户。
    老名和村维持员雷永庆早商量好，“你先要他的场，我再要他的麦子地”。
    “老名！你知道，场是咱二叔的，他逃荒还没回哩！”庆申爹对老名说。
    “过这贱年，花了这你又挡吃，又挡差，与你有啥不好。”
    “不中！实在不中！老名。”
    “在你吧！日本来了你可顶着，反正不花，你的困难也渡不过去。”
    “大人孩子都不愿意呀！”
    “多给你一百元吧！”老名哈哈的笑………“就这罢，你拿着这钱走，这一点小事我给你作了主了。”挥了一下手，就一掌把这庄稼人推出去了。
    第二天清早，庆申爹一夜都没有合上眼，眼泪流满了枕褥。
    “花也得花，不花也得花。”老头哭泣着对庆申说。
    “你为啥接人家的码子呢？退了他吧！”
    “不能退了……”
    “让我退去”。庆申站起来，伸出了一只手，就一直冲出去了。
    经庆申和老名顶了这一回嘴，两家人便结成了仇，强着花了场，还花了六亩地，除给的码子钱，其余一律都上在差帐上。
    “不要再给我闯祸了，外走吧！”一天他父亲对他说。
    庆申同志，便又参加了县大队，这是一九四二年一月的事情。
    锻炼前进
    前年，衡水战斗，蔡庆申还在担任班长，他和两个班，担任着突击队的任务。虽说他也是首先登城，但检讨起来，缺点是很多的。
    机枪响紧了，二排长带了梯子组六个人正往上上，要过一道深沟，和爬过几丈高的城墙。
    枪声更激烈的响了，他们跑着步，才走到沟前沿；但，每个人都跑的气喘喘的。
    “前面激烈的不行呀！”排长回头说。
    “那也得冲呵！排长。”蔡庆申挺起身来说。
    “可得受大损失呀！”排长犹豫的说。
    “不中！受损失也得冲，快冲，谁不冲是个孬种！”庆申不自禁的举起铁锨喊道。
    这时战士们，有的放下梯子，向四外散开，他举起铁锨，向四外叫回了战士，说：“快扛起梯子，到寨墙边就没危险了。”
    战士们回来了，但有的还是扛着梯子慢慢走着。
    “走，咱俩把梯子拉走。”他对他旁边的一个战士说着立刻就把梯子竖了上去，两个人首先登上了城头，一伙人也都赶了上去，占领了城头。
    回到队里，他想了又想：“这样干是不行的！要冲就冲到砦墙墙跟，半路上不能犹豫。梯子组也要好好组织，编好号，而干部不仅带头勇敢，还要先想好办法才行。”此后，蔡庆申便一直成了攻坚的名手。
    楚旺登城
    在楚旺战斗中，连级干部领着六个排长，探头望了一下敌人的工事转过来问道？
    “庆申，你看敌人怎样？”
    “两道鹿砦，围墙一人多高，我看的再清楚也没了。”
    “你们哩？”又问别人道。
    “到底看不清怎样？”
    “你们看地势不彻底呀！”指导员指责说。
    “好吧！那突击的任务，就交给你们二排。”连长于是对蔡庆申说。回到排里，庆申边走边捉摸，到底怎样完成任务呢？
    “首先搭梯子。”他下着决心，随着便叫了梯子组的六个战士带走了。
    “记着拿着叉，举梯子用。”
    他走到了沟旁的梯子旁边，他发愁了半天，这梯子短的这样，如何能上砦呢？”
    “回去运那大梯子吧！”他又命令着，一直往大梯子那边走去，战士们跟在后边。
    “谁敢上去！”他举头望了望沟上的大梯子喊道。
    “我上！”一个战士说。
    “不要露头，用这绳把他捆好拉下来。”他一边说，一边用铁锹向着沟铲了一个缺口。
    大梯子运到沟腰间停住了。
    “不行，推到沟前头的鹿柴边去！叫他荫蔽住，不要暴露了目标。”庆申说。
    梯子运到后他又想：“过水是不容易的，这深的水，几十个秫秸也填不平呵！”心生一计：“把这小梯子搭成桥吧。”
    他用铁锹从旁边挖了一个掩蔽部、自己站在那边，便把木梯子从沟口推了出去。
    子弹打来了，直往沟口打，因为他有掩蔽部，六个人一人也没打着，大家都说：“排长真有办法。”
    以后，他们就忙起来，搭成了一座桥，盖上了门板，又挖了上二道沟的阶梯，拔活了鹿柴，每一步，都是大家商量想主意，直忙到黄昏，连部传集合时，他们才回来。
    “怎样了？”连长问。
    “搭好了桥，还拔活了鹿柴，一个劲跑吧！登城第一没有问题。”庆申笑嘻嘻的说。
    果然楚旺战斗结束了，他连又成了全部各突破口中首先登城的连队，而且只伤了一个人。
    回来，庆申对连里人说：“只要打算完成任务，没有不能完成的。”也就是这样一种实际的精神，使他成为一面勇敢与技术结合的旗帜。
