Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th. A village in the border area of Yeting (Yancheng), during the anti-Chiang guerrilla warfare, created a "four-person group" method to make the masses cadres, and cadres mass-oriented, to flexibly carry out various tasks. During the land re-investigation, the village fairly and reasonably adjusted the land, getting across the idea that loving and protecting the land must be done by organizing everyone to defeat the Chiang army. Of the village's 156 households, excluding the families of revolutionary martyrs, cadres, and militia, each household nominated one person, and every four people were organized into a group based on their ability, location, and other conditions: Person A is responsible for patrolling and striking the night watch; Person B is responsible for public security, logistics, and preferential treatment for those resisting the enemy; Person C is responsible for propaganda and intelligence; Person D is responsible for demolishing bridges and fleeing from bandits, and mutual aid in production. When patrolling, Person A is the group leader, and the other three obey his command; if the enemy loots grain, the four-person group becomes the bridge demolition and escape group, with Person D as the group leader, leading the other three to demolish bridges and lead the four households, old and young, to escape. The village and township cadres check and supervise from time to time. The entire village evaluates merits every ten days, with the masses inspecting the results and giving praise or criticism. This group not only completely organized the masses of the entire village to carry out the struggle against the enemy, but also cultivated activists and backbones for various tasks, enabling the village's work to develop rapidly. Even the original 240 mu of wasteland in the entire village was all cultivated with the help of the four-person group.

    【新华社华中七日电】叶挺（盐城）的边沿区某村，在蒋后游击坚持中创造“四人小组”办法，使群众干部化，干部群众化，灵活进行各种工作。该村在土地复查中，公平合理地调整了土地，打通爱田、保田必须全体组织起来，击败蒋军的思想。全村一百五十六户，除抗烈属、干属、民兵外的群众，每户推出一人，每四人按能力、住处等条件组织一个小组：甲负责盘查打更，乙负责治安后勤优抗，丙负责宣传情报，丁负责拆桥逃反，生产互助。进行盘查时，甲为组长，其余三人听他指挥；如有敌抢粮。四人小组即为拆桥逃反组，丁为组长，领导其余三人拆桥，及率四户老小逃反。村乡干则时加检查督促。每十天全村评功一次，由群众检查成绩，予以表扬或批评。该小组不但把全村群众完全组织起来进行对敌斗争，并培养出各种工作的积极分子和骨干，使该村工作迅速开展，连原有的全村二百四十亩荒田，也在四人小组互助下全部开出。
