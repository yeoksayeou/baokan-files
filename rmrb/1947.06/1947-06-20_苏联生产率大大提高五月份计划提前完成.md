　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Comprehensive reports indicate that Soviet economic achievements have been renewed based on May production materials. In major sectors such as industry, mining, and transportation, most have exceeded the May production plan, and productivity has greatly increased. Thousands of factories in Leningrad have completed the May plan ahead of schedule, and more than 200 factories have already completed the June plan. 512 factories in Moscow completed the May plan on May 24th. Industry in Kiev, Belarus, and many other Soviet republics has achieved similar results. The Soviet Power Station Department has completed the May plan, with production nearly 16% higher than the first May of 1946. The iron and steel industry has exceeded the May plan, with pig iron production 10% higher than in May last year, steel 9% higher, rolled ferrous metals 16% higher, coke 13% higher, and iron ore 20% higher. The Saratov "Gas Pipeline" supply to Moscow exceeded the plan by 14% in April, and the May plan was completed on May 25th. The six-month plan for restoring and constructing light industrial factories has been realized, with new factories and workshops producing 16 million pairs of shoes, 30 million pairs of stockings, 400,000 pieces of glassware, and hundreds of thousands of sets of clothing annually. In the first five months of this year, the textile industry increased ordinary fabrics by 40% compared to the same period last year, wool fabrics by 39%, silk fabrics by 32%, and linen fabrics by 38%. In the first four months of this year, more than 20 food factories in Lithuania have started operations, and tobacco factory production has reached pre-war levels. The Donets and Moscow coal mines completed the May coal production plan ahead of schedule, exceeding the May plan of last year by 14%, and seven coal mines were restored. Oil production has also completed the May plan, with the eastern region increasing by 24% compared to May last year, and the southern and western regions increasing by 14%. Soviet railway transportation exceeded the May plan by 2.1%, carrying 83,180 more carloads of goods than in May last year, with a particular increase in passenger transport in the south. The May locomotive production of transportation machinery manufacturing plants increased by nearly 1.4 times compared to the same period last year, and freight car production increased by nearly one time. Soviet shipping has completed the May plan ahead of schedule, and the staff of the Stalingrad River Wharf exceeded the May cargo handling plan, restoring 75% of the wharf. The May production figures once again confirm that the Soviet socialist competition will guarantee the early completion of this year's production plan.
