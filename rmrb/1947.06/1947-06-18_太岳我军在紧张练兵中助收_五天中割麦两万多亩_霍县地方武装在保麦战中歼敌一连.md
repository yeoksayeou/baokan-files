[This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The People's Liberation Army on the Taiyue Front is vigorously assisting the masses in southern Shanxi with the summer harvest amidst intense training exercises. In five days, they harvested over 21,000 mu of wheat. Outside the villages where the troops are stationed, one can see two tense and serious sets of actions at any time. One is the arduous training of squads and platoons, and the other is scattered harvesting in the golden wheat fields in groups of twos and threes; the movements are equally swift and skilled. In a certain village, the soldiers of the Fifth Company of a certain unit, who were practicing throwing grenades in the field, were resting on the grass. Chang Facai of the grenade launcher squad walked alone towards the field ridge where the farmers were harvesting. Yu Cunyi knew he was going to help with the harvest, shouted, and chased after him like the wind. The other soldiers all laughed and chased after him. The villagers were both happy and uneasy to see so many victorious troops helping him with the wheat. One moment they would say, "Comrades, you have won victories, you should rest well!" Another moment they would say, "You must be tired from throwing grenades, take a break!" And then, "It's getting late, it's time to eat, take a break!" But the people's soldiers replied with a smile, "Villager, this is even more pleasant than resting!" Some said, "It doesn't matter, we are the people's army!" In a short while, they harvested two mu. Later, the whistle sounded, and everyone started training with vigor and vitality again.

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 15th dispatch] The wheat protection battle in Huoxian has begun, and the local armed forces annihilated one company of Yan's troops in the battle of Fengziyuan. On the 20th of last month, a company of the Yan pseudo-police brigade, totaling thirty-five men, attacked near Maliang from Lingshi, attempting to seize wheat. Upon hearing the news, the Huoxian County Brigade immediately dispatched troops to pursue them overnight. After passing through Fengziyuan, they chased to near Qicun, where a fierce battle broke out. Except for the company commander and a guard who escaped, thirty-three people including platoon leader Yang Shengxi were captured alive. We seized four small cannons, three light machine guns, seventeen rifles, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition. Currently, the soldiers and civilians of the county have engaged in an intense rush harvest struggle. The militia and guerrillas on the border of Huo and Ling are using landmines to block the enemy in Lingshi, protecting the masses in the rear to rush the harvest.

　　太岳我军在紧张练兵中助收
    五天中割麦两万多亩
    霍县地方武装
    在保麦战中歼敌一连
    【本报太岳十五日电】太岳前线人民解放军在紧张练兵运动中，仍大力协助晋南群众夏收。五天中割麦两万一千余亩。在各部队驻地的村外，随时可以看到两种紧张严肃的动作。一种是一班一排的苦练，一种是三三两两分散在金黄的麦浪里收割；动作一样的迅速、熟练。在某村野外演习投弹的某部五连战士正休息在草地上，掷弹筒班的畅发财独自向农民正在收割的田垄走去。予存义知道他是要帮助收割，喊了一声就风也似的追上去。别的战士也都说笑着追了上去。老乡见这么多打了胜仗的队伍又给他帮忙割麦，又高兴，又不安。一会儿说：“同志，你们打了胜仗，该好好休息啦！”一会儿说：“你们扔手榴弹扔乏了，歇歇吧！”一会儿又说：“天不早了，该吃饭了，歇歇吧！”但人民的战士笑着回答说：“老乡，这比休息还痛快哩！”有的说：“没有关系，咱们是老百姓的队伍呀！”不一会儿，收割了二亩。后来哨音响了，大家又生龙活虎般的练起武来。
    【本报太岳十五日电】霍县保麦战开始，地方武装在风子垣一役歼灭阎军一个连。上月二十日阎伪保警大队一连共三十五人由灵石出犯马良附近，企图抢麦，霍县县大队闻讯即派部队连夜追击，经由风子垣追至奇村附近，发生激烈战斗，除连长及卫兵一名潜逃外，排长杨生喜以下卅三人均被生俘，我获小炮四门，轻机枪三挺，步枪十七支，子弹千余发。现该县军民已投入紧张的抢收斗争，霍灵边境之民兵游击队以地雷封锁灵石敌人，掩护后方群众抢收。
