Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd: Under the influence of the victory of the Central Jiangsu Liberation Army and its political offensive, over the past month, more than 800 Kuomintang elements in the Nantong-Rugao (East Taipei-North Taipei) area have returned home to surrender themselves to us. Rudong has launched a "wipe out the black spots and perform meritorious service" campaign. Based on the crimes of the Kuomintang elements, the number of black spots is determined, and those with 20 black spots are sentenced to death. Those who return home to surrender can wipe out their black spots and not be held accountable for the past. Those who bring weapons with them can still perform meritorious service to redeem their crimes. After the liberation of Dazhongji, the democratic government released more than 500 local Kuomintang and puppet personnel. Upon hearing this news, more than 400 local Kuomintang and puppet personnel from the strongholds along the Tongyu Road returned to surrender themselves within half a month.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd: In the month from mid-April to mid-May, there were three major desertions in the Kuomintang army in Central Jiangsu, with a total of more than 1,200 people. In the middle of last month, when the 78th Regiment of the 26th Brigade of the Kuomintang 49th Division was "suppressing" Haimen and Qidong, more than 400 people deserted within a week. At the end of the month, when the division and the 4th Division were "sweeping" both Taipei, more than 200 people deserted in five days. In early May, when more than 1,000 people from the 237th Regiment of the 79th Brigade reoccupied ＠Tea, 500 soldiers deserted within ten days. In order to prevent this "serious phenomenon," the officers of the Kuomintang army implemented a system of joint responsibility by company in the 49th Division, so that soldiers could monitor each other, but the result was even more mass desertions. The reasons for the desertions, in addition to being unable to withstand the fatigue of frequent "surprise attacks," "joint suppression," and "stationing and suppression," as well as the threat of guerrillas, were that they were unwilling to accept the bloody orders of their superiors to massacre and trample upon compatriots in the liberated areas.

　　苏中附蒋分子
    千余向我自新
    【新华社华中三日电】在苏中解放军胜利及政治攻势影响下，南（通）如（皋）两台（东台北台）地区附蒋分子，一月来已有八百余人回家自新。如东展开“擦黑点立功运动”，根据附蒋分子罪行，确定黑点数目，满二十个黑点处死刑。回家自新者擦去黑点，不咎既往，携械来归仍可立功赎罪。大中集解放后，民主政府释放五百余土著蒋伪后，通榆路沿线各据点土著蒋伪闻讯回来自新者，半月内即达四百余名。
    【新华社华中三日电】四月中旬至五月中旬的一个月中，苏中蒋军发生三次大逃亡，数达一千二百余人。上月中旬，蒋四十九师二十六旅七十八团“清剿”海门启东时，一周内逃亡四百多人。月底，该师及四师“扫荡”两台时，五天中又逃亡二百多人。五月上旬，七十九旅二三七团千余人重占＠茶，十天内逃亡士兵五百余。蒋军官为防止此“严重现象”，四十九师以连保连坐法使士兵互相监视，但结果更造成整批逃亡。逃亡原因除不堪频繁的“奔袭”“会剿”“驻剿”中的疲劳及游击队的威胁外，即为不愿接受其长官血腥命令屠杀与蹂躏解放区同胞。
