Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Shanghai Chief Representative Xie officially sent a letter on June 3rd to Mr. Cleveland, Director of UNRRA Shanghai, requesting that the following letter be telegraphed to General Rooks, Director-General of UNRRA in Washington. The original letter is as follows:

　　In the past year and a half, the Shanghai Xie's Office has repeatedly pointed out to UNRRA in Washington and the UNRRA China Office the failure of UNRRA to implement a non-discriminatory policy in its post-war relief work in China, and has repeatedly made suggestions (please refer to the telegram from Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu to the Director-General of UNRRA in Washington on December 4th of last year, the telegrams from Wu Yunfu and Lin Zhong of Xie's Office to UNRRA in Washington this March, and others) to improve UNRRA's supply of post-war relief materials to the CCP Liberated Areas. Unfortunately, you have not adopted these important suggestions.

　　Truman Doctrine Controls Most UNRRA Relief Supplies for Chiang's Civil War

　　Until this year, only 2% of the total materials shipped to China reached the CCP Liberated Areas. The vast majority of UNRRA relief supplies shipped to China has become one of the sources supplementing the Kuomintang government's civil war, and only a very small portion of the materials shipped to China has been truly given to the people in both the KMT and CCP areas. This clearly proves UNRRA's incompetence in implementing the post-war relief plan in China. The main reason for this, besides proving that the Truman Doctrine has deeply infiltrated and controlled UNRRA's policy in China, is difficult to explain otherwise. The "non-discrimination policy" seems to have become a tool for UNRRA to help the Kuomintang government wage civil war.

　　UNRRA Aids Chiang in Silencing Voices and Harming the People, Should Share Responsibility for the Disaster with the Chiang Faction

　　The UNRRA China Office has almost completely rejected many important suggestions made by the Shanghai Xie's Office. As early as last October, we formally notified General Egerton that the Chiang government's Ministry of National Defense, in order to achieve its military conspiracy, was sacrificing the lives and property of countless people in the CCP areas and forcibly carrying out the blocking of the Yellow River. In order to avoid the Yellow River disaster and maintain UNRRA's reputation, Xie's Office repeatedly suggested to UNRRA that an agreement between all relevant parties must be implemented, otherwise UNRRA Shanghai should immediately withdraw its assistance in materials, equipment, and specialized technology for the river-blocking project. Most regrettably, General Egerton turned a blind eye to this major issue concerning the lives and property of millions of people. In mid-March of this year, the KMT side, disregarding the agreement among UNRRA, CNRRA, and Xie's Office that the date of the river-blocking should be discussed and determined first, openly completed the unilateral breach of contract in blocking the river. As a result, countless people were swallowed by the Yellow River water and became homeless. After the disaster occurred, Xie's Office again seriously proposed to UNRRA that emergency relief should be immediately implemented for the Yellow River disaster victims. However, UNRRA has not taken any effective steps in this regard so far. This leaves one of the ugliest pages in UNRRA's record of post-war relief work in China. UNRRA should share the responsibility for the formation of the disaster with the KMT side.

　　UNRRA Adopts Discriminatory Policies Against Our Area, Xie's Office Protests Again

　　Furthermore, UNRRA is unwilling to cooperate with Xie's Office. For example: (1) Xie's Office's post-war relief plan with a total value of US$175 million was ignored. (2) Xie's Office requested UNRRA to allocate 30 specialized technical personnel to assist the work of Xie's Office in Shanghai and various localities, but it was shelved. (3) We suggested that UNRRA and CNRRA should invite personnel from Xie's Office to participate in various materials distribution committees, but it was rejected. (4) We requested that the personnel of the Shanghai Xie's Office should not be unreasonably reduced to five, but it was rejected. (5) After the CCP delegation withdrew from Nanjing, the telecommunications contact between the Shanghai Xie's Office and its general office and branches was interrupted. We requested UNRRA to help establish telecommunications contact, but it was ignored. (6) We suggested that the personnel of the Shanghai Xie's Office should have the right to select medical materials, but it was rejected. (7) We believe that all UNRRA personnel who come to our area for inspection work should send a copy of their report to Xie's Office when writing reports to their superiors, but it was also rejected.

　　...For example, these facts are too numerous to mention.

　　However, on the other hand, our impression is that UNRRA staff who are loyal to UNRRA's non-discrimination policy and faithfully implement the basic agreement are often regarded as being too close to the Communists, and pressure is applied to force them to resign.

　　Because UNRRA adopted a discriminatory policy towards the people in the CCP areas, 300 staff members of UNRRA Shanghai jointly protested last July. This April, many senior UNRRA staff members raised the same protest. However, the UNRRA authorities ignored it. General Egerton tried to obstruct Xie's Office's criticism of CNRRA's monopoly on relief materials and the news release criticizing UNRRA and CNRRA for not implementing the basic agreement. UNRRA's attitude towards post-war relief work in the CCP areas is unfair and its measures are inappropriate. Xie's Office calls on the people of the 54 member states of UNRRA to pay attention to this. Xie's Office reiterates its protest!

　　Because the tasks completed by UNRRA in the CCP Liberated Areas are really too few, the people's confidence in UNRRA in the Liberated Areas has been declining. But if UNRRA can seize the extremely limited time in the future and start doing some real post-war relief work for the CCP areas that have always been discriminated against, it is still not too late.

　　UNRRA Should Immediately Convene an Emergency Meeting to Review the Failure of the Non-Discrimination Policy

　　Stored Remaining Post-War Relief Supplies Should Be Directly Transported to Our Area for Distribution to the People

　　UNRRA Shanghai has formally notified Xie's Office that the UNRRA Shanghai Materials Supply Office is planning to continue and increase the supply of materials to the CCP areas. Xie's Office believes that if UNRRA Shanghai really wants to achieve satisfactory results in what it plans, and can avoid repeating the previous delays and disregard for Xie's Office and the people in the CCP areas, then the following minimum necessary measures should be adopted immediately: (1) The Central Committee of UNRRA in Washington should immediately convene an emergency meeting to seriously review the reasons for the failure of the UNRRA's non-discrimination policy in China based on the policy, and determine ways to overcome it. UNRRA in Washington should immediately instruct its China Office to hold a meeting of the same nature. The Shanghai Xie's Office should invite representatives to attend UNRRA Shanghai's meeting. (2) The 7th UNRRA Council meeting held on June 15th should invite representatives from Xie's Office to attend. (3) The remaining UNRRA post-war relief supplies should be immediately stopped from being transported to KMT ports. (4) Only 2% of the materials shipped to China have arrived in the CCP areas so far, so Xie's Office still insists on its post-war relief plan with a total value of US$175 million on January 8th. (5) UNRRA in Washington should immediately adopt effective measures through its China Office to liquidate all unused post-war relief supplies stored in warehouses in Shanghai and other places, and immediately transport all usable materials directly to our area through UNRRA for post-war relief to the people in the Liberated Areas; in particular, it should be used to provide post-war relief to the residents of the Yellow River bed who suffered from the floods caused by the KMT's breach of contract in blocking the river. (6) The remaining UNRRA post-war relief supplies of the China UNRRA in foreign countries should be quickly transported directly from various foreign ports to CCP ports and distributed by Xie's Office. (7) UNRRA Shanghai should immediately take effective steps to help the Shanghai Xie's Office establish telecommunications contact with its general office and branches.

　　If UNRRA Shanghai can accept the above clauses in principle as a basis for negotiation, then Xie's Office is very willing for UNRRA to hold a meeting to discuss the post-war relief issues in the CCP Liberated Areas.

　　Finally, it should be especially pointed out that the leaders of UNRRA in Washington should be vigilant against the confusion between UNRRA's measures in China and the Truman Doctrine; any influence of the Truman Doctrine on UNRRA's China plan is harmful, and the UNRRA Council should strive to avoid it. The resolutions and policies of the UNRRA Council must be put into practice.

　　解总代表函联总署长
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】上海解总代表于六月三日正式函托上海联总克里夫兰署长将下面信件电转华盛顿联总署长鲁克斯将军，原信如次：
    在过去一年半中，上海解总曾屡向华盛顿联总及联总中国分署指出联总在中国执行善后救济工作不歧视政策之失败，并曾多次提出建议（请参阅去年十二月四日周恩来、董必武致华盛顿联总署长之电报，本年三月解总伍云甫及林仲致华盛顿联总之电报及其他），以谋改进联总对中共解放区善后救济物资之供应。但不幸的是你对此等重要建议并未采纳。
    杜鲁门主义控制了联总救济物资大部供蒋内战
    直到今年，仅有运抵中国全部物资百分之二抵达中共解放区。联总运华善后救济物资之巨大部分，已成为补充国民党政府进行内战源泉之一，仅有极少部运华物资真正给予国共两区之人民。此均明确证明联总执行中国善后救济计划之无能。其主要原因，除了证明杜鲁门主义颇为深重的渗入了并控制了中国之联总政策外，实难作其他解释。“不歧视政策”似乎已成为联总帮助国民党政府进行内战之掩护工具。
    联总助蒋堵口残害人民应与蒋方共负灾祸之责
    联总中国分署几乎全部拒绝了上海解总所提出之许多重要建议，我们早在去年十月间已正式通知艾格顿将军说：蒋政府国防部为谋达到其军事阴谋，正不惜牺牲无数万中共区人民之生命财产，强行黄河工程之堵口。解总为避免黄祸并保持联总名誉计，曾屡向联总建议称：各有关方面之协议必须付诸实施，否则上海联总应立即撤消对堵口工程物资器材与专门技术等之援助。但最遗憾的是艾格顿将军将此有关数百万人民生命财产之重大问题则视若无睹。本年三月中旬，国方又不顾联总、行总、解总三方面关于堵口日期应先商讨后始作确定之协议，公然完成了单方面之违约堵口。因之为黄水吞没者，无家可归者，难以计数。解总于灾难形成之后，复向联总严重提出：应对黄河灾民立即实施紧急救济。但迄今仍未见联总对此采取任何有效步骤。此为联总在中国善后救济工作之纪录留下最丑恶之一页。联总对灾祸之形成应与国方共负其责。
    联总对我区采歧视政策解总对此再次提出抗议
    再则联总不愿与解总合作，其例如后：（一）解总所提总额美金一万万七千五百万元之善后救济计划被漠视了。（二）解总曾请求联总拨借三十名专门技术人员协助上海乃各地方解总工作，但被搁置了。（三）我们建议联总、行总各种物资分配委员会应邀请解总人员参加，被拒绝了。（四）我们要求上海解总人员不应被无理减员至五名，被拒绝了。（五）中共代表团自南京撤退后，上海解总与其总会及各分会间之电讯联络即告中断，我们请求联总帮助建立电讯联络，被漠视了。（六）我们建议上海解总人员有选择医药物资之权，被拒绝了。（七）我们认为所有到我区考察工作之联总人员，当向其上级写报告时，应有抄本一份送交解总，亦被拒绝了。
    ……例如这些事实，是实在提不胜提。
    但是，另方面我们的印象是：联总对于效忠联总不歧视政策与忠实执行基本协定之联总职员，常被看做是对共产党太亲密了，必施以压力迫其辞职而后快。
    因联总对于中共区人民采取歧视政策，故上海联总于去年七月曾有职员三百名联署抗议。今年四月又有众多的高级联总职员提出同样抗议。但联总当局未加理会。艾格顿将军对于解总批评行总垄断救济物资，批评联、行总不执行基本协定之新闻发布工作，则力谋阻挠。对中共区之善后救济工作，联总态度不公，措施失当，解总呼吁联总五十四会员国之人民应予以注视。解总对此重申抗议！
    由于联总在中共解放区所完成之任务实在太少了，解放区人民对联总之信心已在低降。但联总如能抓紧未来极其有限之时间，开始为向来被歧视之中共区人民真正作些善后救济工作，那还是来得及的。
    联总应即召开紧急会议检讨不歧视政策之失败
    贮存剩余善后救济物资应即直运我区发给人民
    上海联总已正式通知解总，谓上海联总物资供应处正在计划继续并增进对中共区物资之供应。解总认为上海联总如真欲使所计划者能获得满意结果，且能不重复一如以往之拖延与对解总及中共区人民不加理睬之态度，则下列最起码之必要措施应即予以采纳：（一）华盛顿联总中央委员会应立即召开紧急会议，根据联总不歧视政策认真检讨该政策在中国失败之原因，并定出克服办法。华盛顿联总并应立即训令其中国分署举行同一性质之会议。上海联总举行此项会议时，应邀请解总代表出席。（二）六月十五日举行之第七届联总理事会应邀请解总代表出席。（三）应立即停止剩余之联总善后救济物资运往蒋方各港口。（四）运抵中国之物资迄今仅有百分之二抵达中共区，故解总仍坚持其一月八日总值美金一万万七千五百万元之善后救济计划。（五）华盛顿联总应立即通过其中国分署，采取有效办法，清算所有贮存上海及各地仓库中未曾动用之一切善后救济物资，并立即将其中所有可用之物资经联总直接运往我区，以供解放区人民善后救济之用；特别是应作为提供因国民党违约堵口而遭受水灾的黄河河床居民善后救济之用。（六）中国联总在外国之剩余善后救济物资，应速由各外国港口直运中共港口交解总散发之。（七）上海联总应即采取有效步骤，帮助上海解总建立与其总会及分会间之电讯联络。
    上海联总如能在原则上接受上述诸条款，作为商谈之基础，则解总极愿联总举行会议，共商中共解放区之善后救济问题。
    最后应特别指出者：华盛顿联总领导人员应谨防联总在中国之措施与杜鲁门主义之混淆；杜鲁门主义对于联总中国计划发生任何影响都是有害的，联总理事会对此应力谋避免之。联总理事会之决议与政策必须付诸实践。

    一九四七年六月三日
