Letter Three
To the responsible comrades of the Lianyungang Literary Association:

　　I wholeheartedly support the solicitation of new songs by the Literary Association as published in the People's Daily on May 4th. The subsequent discussion in the next column, stating that songs should be majestic and have a uniform rhythm, is excellent. Especially in "Letter from the Front Lines" No. 2, it says, "In the song collection of thirteen songs, the first is the 'March of the Volunteers,' the second is the 'Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention.' Although the others are new, they are not as popular as the old ones." This is indeed true. The song "Wipe Them Out in One Decisive Battle" is an exception. After reading the newspaper, what concerned me was that the length of the songs was not mentioned.

　　One afternoon, the soldiers were playing baseball and drop-the-handkerchief. A propagandist who had taught songs before came, and the soldiers surrounded him, clamoring, "Teach us a song, teach us a song!" He immediately taught them a short song. A young soldier told me, "Scarcity makes things precious; it's good enough as long as we have something to sing." Although the enthusiasm for singing wasn't high, they were still singing. This shows the urgent need for songs.

　　What the soldiers need are songs that are majestic, powerful, short, and concise, like "I've Cleaned My Three-Person Rifle, Loaded the Bullets," and "The Bugle Blows, the War Drums Sound." The former is majestic and powerful, with good lyrics; the latter has only six lines and just over twenty words. Conversely, some songs have too many twists and turns, and the soldiers don't have time to savor them in humming. Songs that have too many loose and meandering parts, especially long ones, are difficult to popularize. Regarding this type of song, the soldiers say, "The song is not bad, but it's a bit foreign. We're not smart enough to remember it right away." This shows that it won't become popular.

　　Long and listless songs are ones people don't want to sing, don't love to sing, and are the same as not having any at all. The above are my personal opinions. Please consider and take note.

　　来信之三
    连云山文联负责同志：
    阅五月四日人民日报刊载文联征求新歌事，非常拥护，接着下栏就有所议论，所说歌要雄壮，齐唱节奏，很好。尤其是《前方来信》其二说“歌集十三首，第一，义勇军进行曲，第二，三大纪律，八项注意，其他虽是新的，但不如旧的吃的开”，的确不假。“打他一个歼灭战”歌不在此例。阅报后，使我放心不下的是歌的长短问题竟未提到。
    一天下午，战士们正在打棒球，做丢手巾游戏，有个教过歌的宣传员来了，战士们一围而上，嚷着“教歌，教歌”，他立即给他们教了一个短小的歌。一个年青的战士小伙子告我说：“缺者为贵，有唱的就行。”大伙唱劲虽不大，但总是唱起来了，可见需歌之急。
    战士们需要的是雄壮、有力、短小、精干。如《我擦好了三人枪，子弹上了膛》，《军号吹战鼓响》，这一类歌。前者雄壮有力，歌词较好，后者全歌六句，二十余字；反之有些歌子，因其拐湾处很多，战士们没工夫去在哼哼里寻味。凡犯有拐湾多而松，尤其是长的毛病的歌，其流行颇费事。对此类歌，战士说：“歌还不错，就是有点洋味，咱心笨一时记不住。”可见其流行不开了。
    既长而又松劲的歌，大家不愿唱，不爱唱，和没有一样。以上个人意见，请考虑，注意。
