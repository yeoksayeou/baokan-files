　　Firmly Persisted Behind Enemy Lines, Unyielding
    Comrade Liu Dejun Sacrificed Heroically

    [Report from this newspaper in Wuzhi] Comrade Liu Dejun, acting district chief of the Xiaogao District in Wuzhi, gloriously sacrificed himself in the Xiaogao battle on May 29th. Comrade Liu, also known as Sanyang, joined the Eighth Route Army in 1938, and served as a platoon leader. He was resolute and courageous. In 1945, he opened up work south of the road and was transferred back behind enemy lines to lead the mass struggle, achieving remarkable results. This February, he led the armed work team deep behind enemy lines to persist in guerrilla warfare, leading the masses in the struggle against counter-settlements, land reform, and protecting fields and wheat, earning him deep love from the masses. The enemy had offered a reward of 8 million yuan to capture him. On the morning of May 29th, an enemy battalion launched a sneak attack on Xiaogao. Because he was leading the masses in evacuation, he was unable to withdraw in time. He resolutely resisted with hand grenades and rifles. An enemy soldier entered to capture him, but was shot down by him. Another captain came and was also killed. The enemy fired fiercely at him around the house, but no one dared to enter the courtyard. After persisting for more than an hour, the enemy was unable to capture him alive and resorted to burning the house. Comrade Liu finally died heroically. After his sacrifice, the masses were filled with grief and indignation. The county government held a solemn memorial service, and the special commissioner's office issued a special order to commend him, posthumously recognizing him as the district chief of Xiaogao, and called on all cadres to learn from his firm and unyielding revolutionary qualities and integrity. According to the opinions of the masses, Xiaogao Town was renamed Sanyang Town.

　　坚持敌后坚毅不屈
    刘德俊同志壮烈牺牲
    【本报武陟讯】武陟小高区代理区长刘德俊同志，于五月二十九日在小高战斗中光荣牺牲。刘同志又名三阳，一九三八年参加八路军，曾任排长，坚决勇敢，一九四五年开辟路南工作，把他调回敌后，领导群众斗争，成绩卓著。今年二月率武工队深入敌后坚持游击战争，领导群众进行反倒算、土地改革、保田保麦斗争，备受群众爱戴。敌人曾悬赏八百万元捉他。五月二十九日上午敌一个营偷袭小高，他因领导群众转移，未及撤出，即以手榴弹步枪沉着抵抗，一个敌人进去捉他，被他一枪打倒，一个队长又来也被打死。敌在房子周围向他猛烈射击，但无人敢进院。坚持一点多钟敌人不能活捉他，无法将房屋烧毁，刘同志终于英勇殉难。他牺牲后，群众无不悲愤，县府隆重追悼，专署特通令表扬，追认他为小高区长，号召全体干部学习他的坚毅不屈的革命品质与气节。并依群众意见将小高镇改为三阳镇。
