　　Twelve-Year-Old Liu Michang
    宁死对敌不屈服
Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. The Ansei County Government in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region recently commended the child Liu Michang, who resolutely refused to yield under the threat of execution and being buried alive by the enemy. Liu is from Sagouwan, Erxiang, Ansei, and is only twelve years old. In early May, when the enemy from Hediaping harassed the village, the guerrillas covered the masses to quickly evacuate, but he was captured by the enemy because he could not escape in time. The enemy immediately asked about the whereabouts of the guerrillas, but Liu resolutely refused to tell them. The enemy put a gun to his back and fired, but he didn't speak. They then put the gun to his head and fired, but he still didn't speak. The enemy then dug a pit more than a foot deep, pushed him into it, piled in yellow earth and asked again. He still resolutely refused to speak. Finally, the enemy took him back to the blockhouse, but Liu Michang still didn't utter a single word. Five days later, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, Liu Michang finally escaped and returned.

　　十二岁的刘米长
    宁死对敌不屈服
    【新华社西北十日电】陕甘宁边区安塞县府，近特嘉奖在敌人枪毙、活埋威胁下坚决不屈的儿童刘米长。刘是安塞二乡洒沟湾人，现年只十二岁。五月初河店坪敌人出扰该村时，游击队掩护群众全部迅速转移，他一个人未及逃脱，被敌人捉住。敌人当即追问游击队去向，刘坚决不讲。敌人将枪架在他背上射击，他不说。又把枪搁在他头上射击，他仍不说。敌人又挖下了一尺多深的土坑，将他推进坑去，拥进黄土再问。他仍坚决不说，最后敌人把他带回碉堡，刘米长仍一字未吐。五天后乘敌不备，刘米长终于逃跑回来。
