　　The慰问团 Talks About the Happy Life in the Liberated Areas
    Liberated Soldiers Are Extremely Envious
    Hoping to Fight Back to Their Hometowns to Avenge and Overthrow
    [This newspaper, Yu Bei Frontline, 1st dispatch] A Taihang慰问团 group of sixteen people arrived at a liberated soldier's large team somewhere on the front line. They spoke to the newly liberated soldiers about their own experiences of emancipation and the happy life of the people in the liberated areas. Over two hundred liberated soldiers were extremely envious. At the same time, recalling their tragic past, some of them whose homes were in the liberated areas had been conscripted into the army by Chiang Kai-shek before their hometowns were liberated. Zhang Chengyuan from Donggangtou, Shexian County, accused the local tyrant Ren Juwu, who ruled the entire county, saying: "Borrowing 30 yuan meant paying back 90 yuan. Even then, it depended on relatives' giving face. After the family was completely exploited, people were almost starving. Even if they picked a few elm leaves, the landlord would say they couldn't rest there. Yet Chiang Kai-shek reuses these local tyrants and bad eggs, letting them organize a government-in-exile in Tangyin to oppose the democratic government of the liberated areas." Those from the Chiang-controlled areas also accused the Chiang family government and local tyrant landlords of oppressing the people. Zhang Mingqing from Henan reported on how he became a soldier. He said that his family harvested 3.6 shi of wheat each year, but before the wheat even entered their home, the landlord would come to collect rent, saying, "Kinship doesn't matter when it comes to money." In the end, the grain wasn't enough to pay the rent, and they fell further into debt season after season, never able to pay it off, forcing the whole family to flee east and west. A landlord surnamed Lü saw that they had many hands and kept them, but life was still the same as before, getting worse year after year. All the local tyrants are equally vicious. Helpless, they had to make a small living by doing some small business. In 1927, Chiang Kai-shek conscripted his third uncle, who was doing small business; in 1929, he conscripted his second uncle. The Lü family was wealthy and populous, and no one from their family was taken. When Zhang Mingqing and his fourth uncle were just old enough to be conscripted, the head of the bao insisted on taking them, forcing them to flee to relatives twenty li away. They would secretly sneak back home to see their old mother, but they had to run again after only a few words. Zhang Qingming couldn't bear it any longer and borrowed a rifle from his relatives, killing the two sons of the head of the bao. From then on, they couldn't stay at home at all, and his mother had nowhere to go. In the end, the uncle and nephew each sold themselves to a nearby bao for 2,600 yuan to be conscripted. This sum of money was considered the son's final filial piety to his mother. After six years, the family revenge had not been taken, the local tyrants had not been eliminated, and he didn't know if his old mother was alive or dead. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was captured into the traitorous army of Sun Dianying. He angrily said: "Poor people must stand up and emancipate themselves, relying on the Communist Party and on themselves. I hope to fight back to my home soon, and I will also emancipate myself and settle accounts with those who oppress people!" (Fang De)

　　慰问团谈解放区幸福生活
    解放战士羡慕万分
    希望打回家乡复仇翻身
    【本报豫北前线一日电】太行慰问团一组十六人到达前线某部解放大队时，向刚解放的战士谈自己翻身情形以及解放区人民的幸福生活，二百多个解放战士羡慕万分，同时想起过去那段悲惨的历史，他们有的家在解放区，是在家乡解放前被蒋介石抓去当兵的，涉县东岗头张成元控诉统治全县的恶霸地主任聚伍说：“借卅元还九十元，还靠亲戚看面子，家里剥削完了，人也快饿死了，采几片榆叶，地主还说不能歇凉啦，蒋介石却重用这些恶霸坏蛋，叫他们在汤阴组织流亡政府，来反对解放区的民主政府。”来自蒋管区的亦纷纷控诉蒋家政府与恶霸地主压迫人民的暴行。河南的张明清报告他怎样当兵的，他说他家每年打三石六斗麦，不等麦粒进家，地主就来要租子，还说：“人亲财不亲”，算到头粮食不够出租，一季欠一季，永远还不清，逼得全家东逃西窜，逃到外乡，一个姓吕的地主看他们手多，就把他们留下来，但生活仍然和以前一样，一年不如一年。天下恶霸一样毒，没奈何就靠作些小生意过活。廿七年蒋介石抓壮丁，先抓去作小生意的三叔，廿九年又抓走二叔。吕家财多人旺，一个不出。到张明清和他四叔刚够壮丁年龄，甲长就又要抓，逼得他们跑到廿里外的亲戚家去躲，半夜里偷偷跑回家去看看老娘，说不上三句话又得跑，张清明忍无可忍，到亲戚那里借来一枝步枪，把保长的两个儿打死了，从此家里更不能住了，娘也没有去处，实在没法，最后叔侄两人每人以二千六百元的代价卖给附近保上当壮丁，这笔卖身款子算是儿子对母亲的最后孝敬。干了六年，家仇未报，恶霸未除，老母亲不知道死活。抗战胜利后，又把他捕到汉奸队伍孙殿英这里。他愤怒的说：“穷人要抬抬头，翻翻身，只有靠共产党，靠自己。希望早些打到我家，我也翻翻身，和压迫人那些家伙清算！”（方德）
