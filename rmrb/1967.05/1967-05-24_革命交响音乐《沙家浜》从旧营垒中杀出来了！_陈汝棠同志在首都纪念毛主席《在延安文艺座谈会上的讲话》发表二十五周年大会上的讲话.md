Revolutionary comrades:

At this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," as we look back on the intense class struggles on the cultural front over the past decade, we are filled with excitement to see that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art has achieved great victories and borne rich fruits in the cultural revolution. From the bottom of our hearts, we raise a common voice: Long live our most red, most red Red Sun, Chairman Mao! Long live Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles are directed against oppression. All reactionary struggles are directed against revolution. The oppressed are always oppressed by the oppressors, and the oppressors are always oppressed by the oppressed. This is the law of class struggle." Chairman Mao also says: "To overthrow a government, public opinion must be created first, and ideological work must be done first. The revolutionary class is like this, and the reactionary class is also like this." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with their henchmen such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo-han, have long been viciously attacking Chairman Mao's "Talks," this brilliant Marxist-Leninist document, refusing to carry out Chairman Mao's line on literature and art, openly aligning themselves with the reactionary culture of imperialism and revisionism, and in the field of literature and art, blurring the distinction between socialism and capitalism, and the distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, preparing public opinion for the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the restoration of capitalism. Under the control of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the old Central Symphony Orchestra was most influenced by American, British, Italian, and Soviet and Czechoslovakian orchestras. This fully proves that Zhou Yang and his ilk want to turn the literary and artistic circles and the old Central Symphony Orchestra into a base for the restoration of capitalism. They do not carry out Chairman Mao's line of literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not sing the praises of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but let emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, foreigners, and "dead people" fill the stage, even degenerating to the point of rehearsing the reactionary works of the Nazi music minister Richard Strauss. How arrogant is the anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought arrogance of Zhou Yang and his ilk! They even maliciously say: "To make peasants understand symphony music, they must be raised for twenty years." The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in our troupe, such as Li Ling, madly shout that they want to lead the Central Symphony Orchestra to "fight a bloody way out" for the reactionary bourgeois literature and art, attempting to make a desperate struggle against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art.

In January 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing, with Chairman Mao's concern and warmth, raised high the torch of Mao Zedong Thought and came to the Central Symphony Orchestra, igniting the fire of the symphony music revolution. She loudly proclaimed to us: "We cannot follow the 'foreigners' to death, we must take our own road." She also issued a battle cry to us: "Create proletarian symphony music, create symphony music for the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Following Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, we realized that the revolutionization of symphony music must follow the course opened by Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," bravely forge ahead, and firmly adhere to the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Comrade Jiang Qing, through investigation and research, suggested to comrades that the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Shajiabang" be adapted and transplanted into symphony music. Under the warm care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, Comrade Jiang Qing personally sowed the revolutionary seeds of proletarian symphony music in the Central Symphony Orchestra, and in the hearts of every comrade. We are determined to thoroughly break with the "foreigners" and the "dead," to rise up in revolution, to rise up in rebellion, and to launch an attack on the stronghold of bourgeois literature and art. We began the adaptation and creation of the symphony music "Shajiabang."

The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements, Zhou Yang and his ilk, used both soft and hard tactics to strike and sabotage the revolution of symphony music, creating difficulties for performers and copyists, and threatening performers in every possible way, saying: "Singing Beijing opera will ruin your voice," "If you don't pay attention to your singing technique, you will ruin your voice and you will be responsible for it yourself," and so on. They also brought out a pile of foreign frameworks to oppose the inclusion of national instruments, oppose the inclusion of narration and explanation, and oppose performers dressing up and performing according to the character's personality and class status. They wanted to turn the symphony music "Shajiabang," which reflects the people's war and class struggle, into bourgeois "pure music." They also deliberately held some "special music concerts" and "choral music concerts" to interfere with the creation and rehearsal of "Shajiabang," their intentions were evil! But Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art will inevitably defeat the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, and the new revolutionary forces will inevitably defeat the reactionary and decadent things, this is the objective law of class struggle. Under the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary symphony music has emerged from the old camp! The symphony music "Shajiabang" has played the magnificent song of the Chinese people's revolution!

History is created by the people. The heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, have leaped onto the stage of symphony music, turning the history that has been turned upside down back to its right side. The old masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies who have long ruled the stage are swept into the garbage heap of history.

The birth of the symphony music "Shajiabang" is a powerful criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. It has opened up a new era of proletarian symphony music and paved the way for world proletarian revolutionary music. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! In this symphony music reform, Comrade Jiang Qing has made special contributions.

Through this life-and-death, heart-pounding struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, we deeply feel that we must take "Talks" as our motto, firmly follow the great direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated by Chairman Mao, and bravely forge ahead. To perform revolutionary model operas, we must turn our troupe into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought; to perform revolutionary music, we must be revolutionary people, be warriors of Chairman Mao's literature and art. As Chairman Mao taught us 25 years ago, we must change our worldview and move our standpoint over, "move to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, move to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have true literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, true proletarian literature and art." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go out and go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery class struggle, "be the 'ox' of the proletariat and the people, work tirelessly, and die for the cause."

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, we will create more excellent literary and artistic works like the symphony music "Shajiabang," uproot every bourgeois literary and artistic "fortress" occupied by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and let the proletarian and working people's revolutionary literature and art, shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, occupy all the stages. We will establish new socialist standards, establish proletarian peculiarities, loudly proclaim the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, loudly proclaim the masters of history, the workers and peasants, loudly proclaim socialism and communism. Let all the reactionaries at home and abroad and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road tremble in the loud proclamation of the proletarian revolutionaries!

The birth of "Shajiabang" most powerfully proves the correctness of the revolutionary line on literature and art proposed by Chairman Mao 25 years ago in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Let us shout:

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great leader, Chairman Mao!

    革命交响音乐《沙家浜》从旧营垒中杀出来了！
    陈汝棠同志在首都纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会上的讲话革命的战友们：
    当无产阶级文化大革命进入向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动总攻击的关键时刻，在纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，回顾十几年来文艺战线惊心动魄的阶级斗争，毛主席的革命文艺路线取得了伟大胜利，在文化革命运动中，结下丰硕的成果，我们就万分激动。我们从心底迸发出一个共同的声音：祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！祝毛主席的亲密战友林副统帅身体永远健康！
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”毛主席又说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其干将陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵之流，长期以来疯狂地诋毁毛主席的《讲话》这篇杰出的马克思列宁主义光辉文献，拒不执行毛主席的文艺路线，公开地与帝国主义修正主义的反动文化相联合，在文艺领域内，抹煞社会主义和资本主义的区别，抹煞无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的区别，为颠覆无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟做舆论准备。旧中央乐团在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派把持下最流行的是美国、英国、意大利的乐队怎么样，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国家的乐队怎么样，我们就怎么做，这就充分证明周扬之流要把文艺界及旧中央乐团变成资本主义复辟的基地。他们不执行毛主席为工农兵服务的文艺路线，不歌颂工农兵，却让帝王将相、才子佳人、洋人、“死人”充斥舞台，甚至堕落到排练德国法西斯头子希特勒的音乐部长里却·斯特劳斯的反动作品。周扬之流的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的气焰达到了何等嚣张的程度！他们还恶毒地说：“要想农民听懂交响音乐，必须等农民提高二十年。”我团的反革命修正主义分子李凌疯狂地叫嚣，要带中央乐团为反动的资产阶级文艺“杀出一条血路来”，妄图与毛主席的革命文艺路线作垂死的顽抗。
    一九六四年一月，江青同志带着毛主席的关怀与温暖，高举毛泽东思想的火炬来到了中央乐团，点燃了交响音乐革命的烈火。她向我们大声疾呼：“不能跟着‘洋人’去死，一定要走自己的路”。并向我们发出战斗号召：“创造无产阶级的交响乐，创造工农兵的交响乐。”我们遵照江青同志的指示，认识到交响音乐革命化必须沿着毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》所开辟的无产阶级文艺的航道，披荆斩棘奋勇前进，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向。江青同志通过调查研究向同志们建议，把革命现代京剧《沙家浜》加工移植成交响音乐。在毛主席和党中央的亲切关怀下，江青同志亲自在中央乐团播下的无产阶级交响音乐的革命火种，在每个同志的心中燃烧。我们决心彻底与“洋人”“死人”决裂，起来革命，起来造反，向资产阶级文艺的顽固堡垒发动了进攻。开始了交响音乐《沙家浜》的改编创作工作。
    反革命修正主义分子周扬之流，采取软硬兼施的手段，打击、破坏交响音乐的革命，在演员、抄谱等方面进行刁难，千方百计地威胁演员说：“唱京剧会唱坏嗓子”，“不注意唱法，唱坏了嗓子可得由自己负责”……等等。他们还拿出一堆洋框框来反对加入民族乐器，反对加入朗诵、解说，反对演员按人物性格、阶级地位化装表演……。想把反映人民战争阶级斗争的交响音乐《沙家浜》变成资产阶级的“纯音乐”。他们还故意搞一些“专题音乐会”，“合唱音乐会”拚命干扰《沙家浜》的创作、排演力量，用心何其毒也！但是，毛主席的革命文艺路线必然战胜反革命修正主义文艺黑线，新生的革命力量必将战胜反动腐朽的东西，这是阶级斗争的客观规律。在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，革命的交响音乐从旧营垒中杀出来了！交响音乐《沙家浜》奏起了中国人民革命的壮丽颂歌！
    历史是人民创造的，闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的工农兵英雄形象，一跃登上交响音乐的舞台，把被颠倒了的历史又颠倒过来。把长期统治舞台的老爷、太太、少爷、小姐扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    交响音乐《沙家浜》的诞生，是对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派有力的批判，是对反革命修正主义文艺黑线沉重的打击，她开创了无产阶级交响音乐的新纪元，她开拓了世界无产阶级革命音乐的道路。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！在这场交响音乐的改革中，江青同志作出了特殊的贡献。
    通过这场你死我活的、惊心动魄的两个阶级、两条路线、两条道路的斗争，我们深深的体会到，必须把《讲话》作为座右铭，坚定地沿着毛主席指引的文艺为工农兵服务的大方向奋勇前进。我们要大演特演革命样板戏，就必须把我团办成毛泽东思想的大学校；要演革命音乐，必须做革命人，做毛主席的文艺战士。要象毛主席在二十五年前所教导的那样，改造世界观，把立足点移过来，“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，杀出去，到工农兵中去，到火热的阶级斗争中去，“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”
    在毛主席的革命文艺路线指引下创作出更多象交响音乐《沙家浜》那样的优秀文艺作品，把一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派所盘踞的每一个资产阶级文艺“堡垒”连根挖掉，让闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级和劳动人民的革命文艺去占领所有的舞台，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，为巩固无产阶级专政大喊大叫，为历史的主人工农兵大喊大叫，为社会主义、共产主义大喊大叫。让国内、外一切反动派与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在无产阶级革命派的大喊大叫声中发抖吧！
    《沙家浜》的诞生最最有力地证明了毛主席二十五年前《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》所提出的革命文艺路线的英明、正确。让我们高呼：
    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
