In the midst of the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and amidst the nationwide revolutionary criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in all provinces (municipalities), autonomous regions, and cities have held grand meetings and parades to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

In recent days, from the coasts of the East China Sea to the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains, and from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, a festive atmosphere has prevailed everywhere. Broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary literary and art workers, with boundless love, respect, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, have taken to the streets with red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surrounding huge portraits of Chairman Mao, singing revolutionary songs, and dancing joyfully. They have enthusiastically celebrated the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On May 22, 100,000 revolutionary masses in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, held a grand meeting and parade to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the "Talks." Leaders of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and the Shanxi Provincial Military Region, as well as members of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, attended the celebration.

Zhang Riqing, Deputy Secretary of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said that Chairman Mao's brilliant work is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism literary theory, the guiding principle for the revolutionary literary and art movement in China and the world, and a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In commemorating the 25th anniversary of this great work, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the guiding principle, and use Chairman Mao's "Talks" and other brilliant works on cultural revolution as weapons to push the current mass revolutionary criticism to new heights, ensuring that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances from victory to victory.

Revolutionary worker representative and member of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, Jie Yue, spoke at the meeting, saying: The literary and art front must be in the hands of the revolutionary proletariat. Only then can literature and art serve proletarian politics and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They must vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought. We must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and resolutely criticize, overthrow, and demolish the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and in the literary and art circles.

In the Guizhou region, more than 50,000 revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary literary and art workers held a celebration meeting. The broad revolutionary proletarians solemnly pledged to our great leader Chairman Mao: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, severely criticize "The Cultivation of the Self," smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, and thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road as the masterminds behind the revisionist literary black line.

Li Li, a member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary leading cadre, and Chen Weirong, a member of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary literary and art worker, along with representatives of the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, spoke at the meeting. They said that at this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we must use the "Talks" as the most powerful weapon for great criticism and great struggle. We must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line represented by Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo-han, and their masterminds, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must resolutely defend and implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line.

On May 23, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in Harbin held a grand meeting to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the "Talks." Pan Fugeng, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee, Wang Jiadao, Commander of the Heilongjiang Military Region, and Yang Heting, Vice Chairman of the Harbin Revolutionary Committee, attended the meeting.

The representative of the Harbin Revolutionary Committee exposed at the meeting the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party in Harbin who are taking the capitalist road, who, with the support of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line and promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. He said that in commemorating the 25th anniversary of the "Talks," we must use the "Talks" and the Central Committee's "Notification" as weapons to thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line and the counter-revolutionary literary black line promoted by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must let the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao firmly occupy the literary and art front. We must combine the revolutionary criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our departments and units, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end to resolutely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

On May 23, more than 100,000 revolutionary proletarians, revolutionary literary and art workers, revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shandong held a grand meeting and parade. Leaders of the Shandong Revolutionary Committee and the People's Liberation Army Shandong troops, Wang Xiaoyu, Yang Dezhi, Yuan Shengping, Li Yaowen, Han Jinhai, and Wang Zhucuan, attended the celebration.

Wang Xiaoyu and Yang Dezhi spoke at the meeting. They called on the revolutionary proletarians, revolutionary literary and art workers, revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shandong to combine the current struggle with the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, and with the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's series of extremely important instructions on cultural work over the past 17 years. They must also combine this learning with the study of the great historical document, the Central Committee's "Notification" of May 16, 1966. They must further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory and practice of carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. They must further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They must thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

At the celebration meetings held across the country, many representatives of revolutionary literary and art workers unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great instructions, unswervingly implement the principle of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, and unswervingly combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieve ideological transformation, strive to build a highly proletarianized and revolutionary literary and art worker team, and strive to create a brilliant and radiant proletarian socialist new culture.
