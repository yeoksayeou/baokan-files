Just as the British authorities in Hong Kong are conducting large-scale fascist and bloody suppression against our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and are actively plotting a more extensive persecution scheme, an aircraft carrier of the British Empire, "Hermes," loaded with assault troops and landing equipment, suddenly sailed into Hong Kong waters on the 26th.

According to reports, the "Hermes" has a displacement of 27,300 tons, carries 16 helicopters, and also has landing craft and vehicles. The ship has 1,900 crew members, including 900 marine assault troops, claiming to be able to quickly transport the assault troops and equipment ashore.

According to Hong Kong newspapers, the "Hermes" was originally dispatched from Europe to Australia. Due to the recent series of bloody incidents of persecution against Hong Kong compatriots orchestrated by the Hong Kong authorities, which sparked a massive anti-persecution struggle among our compatriots, the ship changed its course to Hong Kong for "defense." In the evening of the 26th, as this warship entered Hong Kong, the helicopters and officers, crew, and marine assault troops on board were lined up on the deck, openly displaying their military might and intimidating our people and Hong Kong compatriots.

According to a report published in the British "Daily Mail" on the 26th from Hong Kong, the aircraft carrier "Hermes" sailed into Hong Kong to "show strength." The newspaper also threatened, "Undoubtedly, Britain is showing its strength and has decided: in the face of China's large-scale intimidation of the Hong Kong situation, firmness is the best policy."

At this time, the British Empire's sailing of the "Hermes" into Hong Kong for conspiratorial activities is being closely watched by the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong.

    妄图威胁镇压我香港同胞反迫害斗争
    英帝航空母舰“堡垒号”突然到港  香港同胞正密切注视敌人阴谋活动
    新华社香港二十八日电  正当香港英国当局接连对我港九同胞进行大规模的法西斯血腥镇压，并积极策划一场更大规模的迫害阴谋的时候，英帝国主义一艘载运突击部队及登陆设备的航空母舰“堡垒号”，二十六日突然驶进香港海面。
    据报道，“堡垒号”排水量二万七千三百吨，载有直升飞机十六架，还有登陆艇及车辆等。舰上官兵一千九百多人，其中有海军突击部队九百人，声称能够迅速把突击部队及设备运送登陆。
    据香港报纸报道，“堡垒号”原来是从欧洲调驻澳大利亚的，因港英当局最近制造一连串迫害香港同胞的流血事件，激起我同胞声势浩大的反迫害斗争，才改变航向来香港“驻防”。二十六日黄昏，这艘军舰开进香港时，舰上直升飞机和官员、船员以及海军突击部队排列在甲板上，公然向我国人民和港九同胞炫耀武力和进行恐吓。
    据英国《每日邮报》刊登的一篇二十六日发自香港的报道说，航空母舰“堡垒号”驶进香港是来“显示力量”。这家报纸并威吓说：“毫无疑问，英国是在显示力量，并已决定：在中国对香港局势进行大肆威吓的面前，坚定是最好的政策”。
    英帝国主义在这个时候把“堡垒号”驶进香港，进行阴谋活动，香港中国同胞对此正密切注视中。
