People of all countries resolutely stand with the Arab people

Governments and public of Asian and African countries condemn U.S. imperialism's war provocation against Arab countries

Fully support Arab people in resisting U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel's aggression

According to Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, May 26th—The National Revolutionary Council of Algeria held a special meeting on the evening of May 25th under the chairmanship of President Boumedienne and issued a statement on the 26th saying: "The people of Algeria, the National Revolutionary Council, the government, and the National People's Army support the Arab revolutionary cause. They are prepared for any unexpected events and have been mobilized because the new threats from imperialism directly involve the people of Algeria."

The statement said: "The National Revolutionary Council calls on the people of Algeria and the Arab countries to take action to eliminate all imperialist interests in the Arab countries."

The statement pointed out that the struggle recently faced by the Arab countries is a part of the common struggle of the people of all countries against imperialism. In the Middle East, imperialists support Israel entirely to facilitate their continued control over this key region of the world. In recent days, the conspiracies of imperialists in the Middle East are intended to divert international attention from their actions in another region—Vietnam.

The statement said: "No matter how cunning these conspiracies and threats are, the Arab countries will not be intimidated. The activities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean will not intimidate the people of the Arab countries, just as the activities of the Seventh Fleet have not stopped the Vietnamese people's resistance."

On the same evening, another announcement was issued in Algiers stating that, in view of the increasingly serious situation caused by the actions of imperialism and Zionism in the eastern Arab region, the Algerian government has taken measures to deal with any unexpected events.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, May 25th—Somali Foreign Minister Duale, in a speech at a gathering to commemorate "African Liberation Day" on May 25th, condemned Israel's threat of aggression against Syria and other Arab countries and expressed that the Somali government and people support the Palestinian people's struggle to reclaim their homeland.

He said that the Somali government has clearly stated that if the Israelis attack Syria or any other Arab country, the Somali government will stand with the Arab countries and people to confront Israel.

He said that the Somali government and people have always believed that the land of Palestine is the homeland of the Palestinian Arabs. "The only realistic solution to the Palestinian problem is to return this land to its rightful owners."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, May 27th—Abdul Hamid Khan Bashani, Chairman of the National Awami Party of Pakistan, recently issued a statement pointing out that the new plot of aggression by Israel against the Arab countries has created a serious situation, and this serious situation requires people to fully and actively support the Arab people's struggle to defend their country.

The Pakistan Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement in Lahore supporting the actions taken by the Arab countries in the Gulf of Aqaba to safeguard Arab interests and resist the aggressors of Israel and their imperialist masters. The statement said that at this critical moment when the Arab people are bravely fighting to completely eliminate imperialism and old and new colonialism from Arab land, the people of Pakistan guarantee their support.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khone, May 26th—The Pathet Lao radio station issued a commentary on May 25th saying: "The people of Laos strongly condemn and protest against U.S. imperialism's instigation of Israel's aggression against Syria and provocation against the Arab countries."

The commentary said: "The people of Laos firmly support Syria's just stance against aggression and firmly support the struggle of the Arab people for national independence and the maintenance of their independence."

The commentary said: "U.S. imperialism is not only the enemy of the people of Laos but also the sworn enemy of the Arab people and the people of the world."

    公报指出，阿拉伯国家最近面临的斗争，是世界各国人民反对帝国主义的共同斗争的组成部分，在中东，帝国主义者支持以色列，完全是为了便于它们能继续控制世界这一关键地区，几天以来帝国主义者在中东地区所施展的阴谋活动，是为了转移国际上对它们在另一地区——越南的行径的注意。
    公报说：“不管这些阴谋和威胁怎样狡猾，阿拉伯国家是决不会被吓倒的。（美国）第六舰队在地中海的活动，也吓不倒阿拉伯各国人民，就象第七舰队的活动阻挡不了越南人民的抗战一样。”
    同一天晚上，在阿尔及尔发表的另一项通告说，鉴于帝国主义和犹太复国主义的行动在阿拉伯东部造成的日益严重的局势，阿尔及利亚政府已经采取了应付任何意外事件的措施。

    他说，索马里政府明确表示，如果以色列人进攻叙利亚或任何其他阿拉伯国家，索马里政府就将站在阿拉伯国家和人民一边对付以色列。
    他说，索马里政府和人民一贯认为，巴勒斯坦这块土地是巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的家园。“巴勒斯坦问题的唯一现实解决办法，就是把这块土地归还给它的合法的主人。”
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第二十七日电　巴基斯坦民族人民党主席阿卜杜勒·哈密德汗·巴沙尼最近发表声明指出，以色列对阿拉伯国家发动的新的侵略阴谋已造成了严重的局势，这一严重局势要求人们充分地、积极地支持阿拉伯人民为保卫他们的国家而进行的斗争。
    巴基斯坦亚非人民团结组织在拉合尔发表声明，支持阿拉伯国家在亚喀巴湾所采取的维护阿拉伯利益、反对以色列侵略者及其帝国主义主子的行动。声明说，在阿拉伯人民为从阿拉伯土地上彻底消灭帝国主义和新老殖民主义而进行英勇斗争的关键时刻，巴基斯坦人民保证支持他们。
    据新华社康开二十六日电　巴特寮电台二十五日发表评论说：“老挝人民强烈谴责和抗议美帝国主义唆使以色列对叙利亚的侵略和对阿拉伯各国的挑衅。”
    评论说：“老挝人民坚决支持叙利亚反对侵略的正义立场，坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民为争取和维护民族独立而进行的斗争。”
    评论说：“美帝国主义不仅是老挝人民的敌人，同时也是阿拉伯人民和世界人民的不共戴天的敌人。”
