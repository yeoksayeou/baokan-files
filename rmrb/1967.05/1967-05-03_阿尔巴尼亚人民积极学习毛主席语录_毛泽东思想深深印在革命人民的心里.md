The broad masses of workers and intellectuals in Albania are studying Chairman Mao's quotations with great enthusiasm, filled with boundless love and admiration for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

The Albanian people not only study Chairman Mao's teachings seriously from the French version of "Chairman Mao's Quotations" they have, but also eagerly purchase and study the quotations selected and published in the Chinese magazines "Beijing Weekly" and "People's Pictorial" whenever they arrive at bookstores in Albania. Some people even copy down the quotations of Chairman Mao from the news bulletins published by the Chinese Embassy in Albania and paste them on the walls as mottos for study. Some departments have compiled small booklets categorizing Chairman Mao's quotations along with quotations from other classical writers of Marxism-Leninism according to the needs of their work, for the study of cadres and the masses.

Many workers have expressed their enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's quotations after learning them.

The famous Albanian writer, Alex Caci, excitedly said upon receiving the French version of "Chairman Mao's Quotations," "This is the most precious gift from our Chinese comrades. Chairman Mao uses simple and clear language in his works to express the truth that people all over the world yearn to know." A worker at the Val-Deje Hydroelectric Power Station construction site said, "I love reading Chairman Mao's quotations the most because Chairman Mao's words are contemporary Marxism-Leninism, a beacon for the people of the world." A technician at the Tirana Tractor Repair Factory said, "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon against imperialism and revisionism. It is our guide for all our work." Another technician at the factory said, "Chairman Mao's quotations are as necessary to us as our daily bread, inspiring us and giving us strength."

A female sanitary worker in Tirana said, "I love reading Chairman Mao's quotations because from them I can learn the truth, be inspired, and become a noble person who is useful to the people and to socialist society in my work and life."

The female students of the "November 29" School in Durrës copy down and study the quotations of Chairman Mao published in the news bulletins from the Chinese Embassy every time they receive them. A student said, "Mao Zedong Thought has deeply imprinted itself in the hearts of people all over the world, becoming a torch to inspire their revolution."

Vlora Middle School's French teacher, Vlashi, spoke about his feelings on studying Chairman Mao's quotations, saying, "I recently reread Chairman Mao's words: 'Comrade White's selfless spirit of serving others and not oneself is manifested in his extreme responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member should learn from him.... We all should learn from his spirit of selflessness. From this point, one can become a person who is greatly beneficial to the people.' He said, 'Comparing my own thoughts and work, I feel ashamed, and I am determined to study the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" well.'

Vlashi also said, "There was a period when I encountered difficulties and setbacks in my work. But after studying Chairman Mao's quotations, my mind became clear. Chairman Mao said, 'Struggle, failure, struggle again, fail again, struggle again until victory—this is the logic of the people, and they will not deviate from this logic.' This strengthened my courage and strength to overcome difficulties, and my work became smooth."

After gaining some initial understanding from studying Chairman Mao's quotations, Vlashi decided to teach the quotations he had learned to his students. Now, he has started teaching one quotation from Chairman Mao in every French class.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民积极学习毛主席语录
    毛泽东思想深深印在革命人民的心里
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚广大劳动人民和知识分子怀着对中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱和敬仰的心情，积极学习毛主席语录。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民平时不仅从他们得到的法文版《毛主席语录》中认真学习毛主席的教导，而且每当中国的《北京周报》和《人民画报》运到阿尔巴尼亚的书店时，人们争相购阅，积极学习这些报刊上结合实际选登的毛主席语录。也有的人把中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使馆编印的新闻公报上的毛主席语录抄录下来，贴在墙上，作为座右铭学习。有些部门还根据本部门工作的需要，把毛主席语录，同马克思、列宁主义其他经典作家的语录，分类编成小册子，供干部和群众学习。
    许多职工在学习毛主席语录后，热情赞扬毛泽东思想。
    阿尔巴尼亚著名作家阿列克斯·恰奇在他得到法文版的《毛主席语录》时兴奋地说：“这是中国同志送给我的最最珍贵的礼物。毛主席在他的著作中用简洁明了的语言说出了全世界人民渴望知道的真理。”瓦尔—德耶水电站建筑工地一个职工说，我最爱读毛主席语录，因为毛主席的话是当代的马克思列宁主义，是全世界人民的指路明灯。地拉那拖拉机修配厂一位技术员说，毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义、修正主义的强大武器。它是我们进行一切工作的指针。这个工厂的另一名技术工人说，毛主席语录对我们来说，象每天所需要的粮食一样，鼓舞着我们，给我们增添着力量。
    地拉那一位女卫生员说，我最爱读毛主席语录，因为从中能够学习到真理，得到鼓舞，使自己在工作和生活中成为一个高尚的、对人民和社会主义社会有用的人。
    都拉斯“十一月二十九日”学校的女学生每次收到中国使馆编印的新闻公报后，都把公报上刊登的毛主席语录抄下来学习。一位同学说，毛泽东思想已经深深地印在全世界人民的心坎里，成为鼓舞他们革命的火炬。
    发罗拉十二年制中学的法文教员弗拉歇里在谈到他学习毛主席语录的感想时说，我最近重读了毛主席的这段话：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。……我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。”他说，对照我自己的思想和工作，我觉得很惭愧，我决心很好地学习《纪念白求恩》这篇文章。
    弗拉歇里还说，有一个时期，我在工作中遇到了困难和挫折。但当我学习了毛主席的语录以后，心里豁然开朗了。毛主席说：“斗争，失败，再斗争，再失败，再斗争，直至胜利——这就是人民的逻辑，他们也是决不会违背这个逻辑的。”这增强了我克服困难的勇气和力量，工作也就顺利了。
    弗拉歇里在学习毛主席语录有了初步的体会之后，决心把他学过的语录教给自己的学生。现在，他已经开始在每堂法文课上，教同学学一条毛主席语录。
