    Swaziland Progressive Party Deputy Secretary Hails Victory of China's Cultural Revolution
    *Notice* Shows Splendor of Great Mao Zedong Thought

    CAIRO, May 25 (Xinhua) — Swaziland Progressive Party Deputy Secretary Herbert Nkosi said here today to a Xinhua correspondent, "We hail the publication of the *Notice* by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It is a brilliant document of Marxism-Leninism, a beacon guiding the great proletarian cultural revolution from victory to victory. It shows the splendor of the great thought of Mao Zedong."

    This Swaziland freedom fighter pointed out that the decision made in the *Notice* by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has dealt a crushing blow to the representatives of the bourgeoisie who are attempting to usurp power and restore capitalism in China. The broad masses of the Chinese people have been greatly inspired by this *Notice* and have thrown themselves into the unprecedented revolutionary torrent with even greater enthusiasm.

    Nkosi went on to say that by correctly following the revolutionary line laid down in the *Notice*, "the Chinese people have exposed the counter-revolutionary and revisionist plots of China's Khrushchev to sabotage the country and the nation, and have criticized his nonsense book *Self-Cultivation*."

    This Swaziland freedom fighter, in refuting the fallacies of the top-ranking capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party, said that the final victory of the socialist system must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat, for there is no other way, because other ways cannot smash the resistance of the bourgeoisie.

    He stressed that, as Chairman Mao often teaches, all class struggles are political struggles. The current great proletarian cultural revolution in China is a very sharp class struggle. This struggle is not only for the Chinese people but also for all the oppressed peoples of the world. It is a great encouragement to the national liberation movement. He said that in the Soviet Union, the modern revisionist clique has usurped power, established bourgeois dictatorship, and suppressed the Soviet people. Now capitalism has been restored in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionists have betrayed the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed peoples.

    Nkosi finally said that the great proletarian cultural revolution in China will certainly overthrow the handful of monsters and demons within the Chinese Communist Party who are attempting to make China follow the revisionist line. Chairman Mao is firmly leading the world revolution to victory and has given the world's people who seek liberation the most reliable base.

    斯威士兰进步党副总书记欢呼中国文化大革命取得的胜利
    《通知》显示了伟大的毛泽东思想光辉
    新华社开罗二十五日电　斯威士兰进步党副总书记赫伯特·恩科西二十五日在这里向新华社记者发表谈话说：“我们欢呼中共中央《通知》的发表，它是光辉的马克思列宁主义文件，是引导无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利的灯塔，它显示了伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。”
    这位斯威士兰自由战士指出，中共中央在《通知》中作出的决定给予要篡夺政权并在中国复辟资本主义的资产阶级代表人物以毁灭性的打击。中国广大群众受到这个《通知》的极大鼓舞，更加热情地投入史无前例的革命洪流中去。
    恩科西接着说，由于正确地遵循《通知》所规定的革命路线，“中国人民群众揭发了中国的赫鲁晓夫的祸国殃民的修正主义阴谋，并批判了他的那本胡说八道的书《修养》”。
    这位斯威士兰自由战士在驳斥中国党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的谬论时说，走向社会主义制度的最后胜利一定要经过无产阶级专政，没有别的办法，因为其他办法不能摧毁资产阶级的反抗。
    他强调说，正如毛主席经常教导的，一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。目前中国的无产阶级文化大革命是一场非常尖锐的阶级斗争。这场斗争不仅是为了中国人民，也是为了全世界一切被压迫人民，它是对民族解放运动的莫大鼓舞。他说，在苏联，现代修正主义集团篡夺了政权，建立了资产阶级专政，并镇压苏联人民，现在资本主义已在苏联复辟。苏联修正主义者出卖了被压迫人民的革命斗争。
    恩科西最后说，中国无产阶级文化大革命定将打倒中国共产党内一小撮企图使中国执行修正主义路线的牛鬼蛇神。毛主席正在坚定地领导世界革命走向胜利，并使全世界求解放的人民有了最可靠的根据地。
