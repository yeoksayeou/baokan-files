The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xinlu Brigade, Luojing Commune, Baoshan County, Shanghai, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. While carrying out a thorough criticism of the revolution, they are focusing on the harvesting, planting, and management of summer crops.

New China News Agency, Shanghai, May 30th - The Shanghai Liberation Daily recently published a news item about Xinlu Brigade, Luojing Commune, Baoshan County, Shanghai, resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp the revolution and promote production," focusing on harvesting, planting, and management, and striving for a complete victory in the summer agricultural work. It also published two readers' letters discussing the management of summer harvests and preventing waste, along with an editorial note.

The editorial note of the Liberation Daily states: To do a good job in the summer agricultural work, it is necessary to emphasize politics and strictly implement Chairman Mao's instructions: "Every year, the three tasks of harvesting, storage, and consumption (harvesting, storage, and consumption) must be tightly grasped." One must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and on the basis of fully mobilizing the masses, rationally arrange the labor force to ensure both good harvesting and good management.

Achieving a bumper harvest of grain and cotton is a major issue related to the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and supporting the world revolution. Rural cadres must display a bold and responsible spirit, organizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, which has been ignited during the Cultural Revolution, into the summer agricultural work, and strive for a complete victory in the summer agricultural work.

The news reports: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres of Xinlu Brigade, Luojing Commune, Baoshan County, are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. While carrying out a thorough criticism of the revolution, they are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp the revolution and promote production" and the great strategic line of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." They are focusing on harvesting, planting, and management. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have expressed their determination to use their actual work in the summer agricultural work to smash the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev, who is attempting to sabotage the socialist economy in the countryside and restore capitalism.

In recent days, the "March Yellow" wheat has been harvested. According to the threshing situation in production teams such as Xutang and Nanwang, the yield is approximately 400 jin per mu, which is an increase compared to last year. To ensure a bumper harvest of summer grain, half a month ago, each production team inspected and repaired the warehouses, fields, threshing machines, and other facilities, striving to thresh as soon as they harvest, and ensuring that the stored grain does not spoil or deteriorate. After the wheat is harvested, a group of auxiliary laborers was immediately organized to pick up the wheat heads, striving to collect every grain.

Recently, continuous rain has caused waterlogging in the fields. The broad masses of community members and cadres braved the rain to dig ditches and drain water, straightening and securing the fallen wheat, allowing the wheat heads to grow fully. At the same time, they strengthened the field management of cotton and early corn, doing a good job of loosening the soil, fertilizing, and transplanting, promoting the growth of cotton and corn seedlings, and striving for a bumper harvest of grain and cotton.

Letters from Li Chengxun and Wang Yanbin of Malu Commune, Jiading County, and Wang Hailian and Jin Xuelin of Chuansha County suggest that while rushing to harvest the summer grain, it is necessary to arrange the labor force and focus on the management of cotton and corn. Both harvesting and management must be ensured to guarantee a bumper harvest of grain and cotton this year. They also suggested that this year's wheat has grown well, with full grains, and a bumper harvest is highly likely. However, due to several storms at the end of spring and the beginning of summer, some wheat has fallen. Although various measures have been taken, some wheat heads are still lying in the fields. Therefore, they proposed that the authorities at all levels should arrange auxiliary laborers in advance to pick up the wheat heads in the fields, striving to collect every grain, and not to waste the grain that is already in hand.

    抓革命促生产集中力量打好夏收这一仗
    上海宝山县罗泾公社新陆大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在开展革命大批判的同时，大抓夏季作物的收、种、管
    新华社上海三十日电  上海《解放日报》最近发表了上海宝山县罗泾公社新陆大队坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，抓好收、种、管，夺取三夏全胜的消息和关于做好夏收管理、防止浪费问题的两封读者来信，并加了编者按语。
    《解放日报》的编者按语说：要搞好“三夏”工作，必须坚持突出政治，不折不扣地贯彻毛主席的指示：“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧。”要相信群众，依靠群众，在充分发动群众的基础上，妥善安排劳力，做到既收好，又管好。
    夺取粮棉丰收，是关系到社会主义革命和社会主义建设、支援世界革命的大问题。农村干部要发扬大胆负责精神，把广大群众在文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲，组织到
  “三夏”中去，夺取“三夏”全胜。
    消息说：宝山县罗泾公社新陆大队广大贫下中农和干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在开展革命的大批判的同时，坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，狠抓收、种、管。广大贫下中农和革命干部表示，一定要以搞好“三夏”工作的实际行动，粉碎中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图破坏农村社会主义经济，复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    这几天，“三月黄”大麦已开镰收割。据许塘、南王等生产队脱粒的情况看，亩产约四百斤左右，比去年有所增产。为了夺取夏粮丰产丰收，半个月前，各生产队就对仓库、场地、脱粒机等进行了检查和修理，力求随收随脱粒，库存粮食不发生霉烂变质事故。麦子收起以后，立即组织了一批辅助劳力拾麦穗，力求颗粒归仓。
    最近，连续阴雨，农田积水，广大社员和干部，冒雨开沟排水，把倒伏的麦子扶起扎好，让麦穗长足长好。同时，他们对棉花、早玉米加强了田间管理，做好松土、追肥、移苗等工作，促使棉花、玉米苗齐苗壮，力争粮棉丰收。
    嘉定县马陆公社的李承训、王岩宾和川沙县王海连、金学林的两封来信提出，在抢收夏粮的同时，一定要安排好劳力，狠抓棉花、玉米的管理。既要抓好收，也要抓好管，以保证今年的粮棉全面大丰收。他们在信中还提出，今年三麦生长良好，麦粒饱满，丰收大有希望。但由于今年春末夏初遭到数次暴风雨的侵袭，部分麦子倒伏，各地虽采取了各种措施，还有些麦穗仍倒在麦地里。因此，他们建议各级干部及早安排辅助劳动力，把田里的麦穗拾回来，力争颗粒归仓，千万不能把到手的粮食浪费掉。
