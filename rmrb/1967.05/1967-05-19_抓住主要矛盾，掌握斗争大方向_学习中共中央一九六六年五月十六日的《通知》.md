In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must grasp the main contradiction. Only by grasping the main contradiction can we firmly hold the direction of the struggle.

What is the main contradiction in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? The great historical document, the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, clearly answers this question.

The great historical document personally drafted by Chairman Mao is to direct the spearhead of the struggle against "those within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road, those who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles and are acting as representatives of the bourgeoisie." In this document, Chairman Mao points out: "A number of bourgeois representatives have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles. These are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Against these counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must carry out thorough criticism, clean them out, and seize back the leadership they have usurped. "Our struggle against them can only be a struggle to the death."

In other words, the main contradiction we must resolve in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road. This is an antagonistic contradiction, a contradiction between us and the enemy. Resolving this main contradiction and directing the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road is the direction of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road is the concentrated expression of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in our country, and the concentrated expression of the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. This is the biggest characteristic of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, and it is also an objective law.

The handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road represent the interests of the bourgeoisie and reflect the demands of the bourgeoisie. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. They appear in the guise of "Party and government leaders" but speak for the bourgeoisie and act for the bourgeoisie. They use the power they have usurped from the Party and the state to implement bourgeois policies, attempting to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In short, the bourgeois representatives who have sneaked into the Party have secretly set up a bourgeois command headquarters within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, with China's Khrushchev as the head. Therefore, we must concentrate our forces to smash this bourgeois command headquarters and thoroughly criticize, expose, and denounce their counter-revolutionary revisionist goods. Only in this way can we eliminate the greatest hidden danger, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our country does not change color.

The contradiction between the two classes and the two roads is concentrated in the contradiction between the proletariat and the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road. This was pointed out by Chairman Mao long ago.

In 1957, in his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out that revisionism is more dangerous than dogmatism. Here, revisionism mainly refers to the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Party.

In May 1963, Chairman Mao pointed out that in our cadre ranks, "there are many people who do not distinguish between enemies and ourselves, collude with each other, are corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, divided and disintegrated, pulled out and sent in." Chairman Mao also said: "If we proceed in this way, it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at most, a few dozen years at least, to inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will definitely change color." Here, the emphasis is on the danger of the elements within the Party who are pulled out and sent in by the bourgeoisie.

In July 1964, when Chairman Mao spoke about the problem of the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, he raised the issue of "preventing the repetition of Khrushchev's revisionism in China" and proposed that the first condition for the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause is that "they must be genuine Marxists-Leninists, not like Khrushchev, who hangs out the sign of Marxism-Leninism but is a revisionist."

In January 1965, in "Some Questions on the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside," Chairman Mao pointed out: "The focus of the movement is to deal with those within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road."

In recent years, Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out that we must be vigilant against revisionism, especially against revisionism in the central leadership.

After several years of preparation, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The main purpose of this great revolution is to overthrow the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road, especially to overthrow the biggest handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road. This is to grasp the main contradiction from an analysis of the various complex contradictions in the current stage of our country.

We should combine the new situation of the current struggle and the revolutionary practice of the past year to study the most basic requirement of the Notification, which is to grasp the main contradiction and firmly hold the direction of the struggle, and not to be distracted by various secondary contradictions and deviate from the direction of the struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process involving more than two contradictions, we must use all our strength to find the main contradiction. Once we grasp this main contradiction, all problems will be solved. This is the method Marx used to study capitalist society. Lenin and Stalin also used this method when they studied imperialism and the general crisis of capitalism, and when they studied the Soviet economy. Countless scholars and practitioners who do not understand this method end up lost in a sea of smoke, unable to find the center, and thus unable to find a way to resolve the contradictions." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when class relations are undergoing rapid changes, we must pay attention to grasping the main contradiction at all times.

Only by grasping the main contradiction can we develop and strengthen the leftist forces, unite the broad masses and the broad cadres, achieve revolutionary great unity, and isolate the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road to the greatest extent. We must concentrate our forces to resolve this main contradiction, and thoroughly criticize the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and eliminate their poison spread across various fronts.

There are also contradictions among the leftist mass organizations. This is a contradiction between right and wrong within the leftist ranks. In some cases, one side is correct and the other side is wrong on a particular issue. In some cases, one side is more wrong and the other side is less wrong on a particular issue. In some cases, one side is correct on one issue but wrong on another, and vice versa. The above situations involve principled differences. However, their contradictions are secondary, and their common enemy is the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road. Their direction is the same. Once the main enemy is identified and the main contradiction is grasped, the contradictions among the leftist mass organizations can be correctly handled and resolved, and the method of handling contradictions between the enemy and ourselves will not be used to deal with the other side. The differences among the leftist mass organizations should be resolved through criticism and self-criticism. Disputes between the two sides can be resolved through consultation. Secondary issues that cannot be resolved for the time being should be set aside, and efforts should be made to unite against the enemy. This is not unprincipled, not muddling through, not compromise, and not conciliation, but a correct way to achieve revolutionary great unity, a manifestation of the principled nature of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. On the contrary, if the leftist organizations cling to the issues of dispute, regard trivial issues as more important than the sky, and are keen on "fighting internal wars," they have actually abandoned principles and are exhibiting the evil tendencies of sectarianism, factionalism, and anarchism.

The relationship between the leftist mass organizations and the masses who have joined conservative organizations due to lack of understanding is a contradiction within the people, not a contradiction between the enemy and ourselves. As long as we grasp the main contradiction and identify the main enemy, we will understand that the masses who have been deceived by the conservative organizations are also victims of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They are our class brothers and sisters, and we should patiently educate them to draw a clear line with the bad elements who manipulate them behind the scenes and return to the side of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line. To isolate and thoroughly strike at the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road to the greatest extent, we must do painstaking political and ideological work on the masses who lack understanding. In this regard, we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching about believing in the masses. We should implement Chairman Mao's instructions that the proletariat must not only liberate itself but also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. The errors made by the masses who have been deceived and joined conservative organizations are errors of understanding, and we should help them liberate their minds and put down their burdens. We can only persuade them, not coerce them, not humiliate them, and not retaliate. If they withdraw from conservative organizations and join revolutionary organizations, they should be welcomed, and they should be treated correctly according to the principle that revolution does not distinguish between early and late comers, and they should not be discriminated against. If they maintain their original organizations and rise up in revolt themselves, changing the political direction and turning the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road, they should also be welcomed and should not be discriminated against. This is not right opportunism or capitulationism, but the correct principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This is beneficial to the proletariat, beneficial to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and beneficial to the completion of the great historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is how we can unite the vast majority of the masses and stand unshakable. On the contrary, the opposite approach is beneficial to the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road.

The masses who have joined conservative organizations should also strictly demand of themselves, identify the main contradiction, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, grasp the direction of the struggle, and direct the spearhead of the struggle against the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road. If they have made mistakes, they should admit them and correct them. As long as they correct their mistakes, it is good. They should not be emotional and continue to lose their way. They should be vigilant and not be incited by bad elements.

When we study the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, we should combine it with reality, grasp living thoughts, carry out rectification, further identify the main contradiction, and better grasp the direction of the struggle, especially to concentrate our forces to thoroughly criticize the handful of people within the Party who are in power and are taking the capitalist road.

    抓住主要矛盾，掌握斗争大方向
    ——学习中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们必须抓住主要矛盾。只有抓住主要矛盾，才能坚定地掌握斗争的大方向。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，主要矛盾是什么呢？一九六六年五月十六日中共中央《通知》这个伟大的历史文件，明确地回答了这个问题。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的这个伟大的历史文件，就是把斗争矛头指向“那些支持资产阶级学阀的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，那些钻进党内保护资产阶级学阀的资产阶级代表人物”。在这个文件里，毛主席指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”对于这批反革命修正主义分子，必须彻底批判，必须清洗，必须把他们窃取的领导权夺回来。“我们对他们的斗争也只能是一场你死我活的斗争”。
    这就是说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要解决的主要矛盾就是，无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。这种矛盾是对抗性的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。解决这个主要矛盾，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就是这场无产阶级文化大革命斗争的大方向。
    无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是我国无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级斗争的集中表现，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的集中表现。这是在无产阶级专政的条件下，特别是在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，阶级斗争的最大特点，也是一条客观规律。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，集中地代表了资产阶级的利益，集中地反映了资产阶级的要求。他们打着“红旗”反红旗。他们以“党政领导人”的面目出现，而替资产阶级说话，替资产阶级办事。他们运用所窃取的党和国家的权力实行资产阶级政策，力图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。总之，钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物，在无产阶级专政机构内部，隐蔽地设置了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级的司令部。因此，我们必须集中力量打掉这个资产阶级的司令部，把它的一套反革命修正主义货色批深、批透、批臭。这样，才能消除最大的隐患，才能巩固无产阶级专政，才能保证我们国家不变颜色。
    两个阶级、两条道路的矛盾，集中地表现为无产阶级同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是毛主席早就指出的。
    一九五七年，毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作中，指出修正主义比教条主义有更大的危险性。这里指的修正主义，从国内来说，主要的就是指的党内的资产阶级代理人。
    一九六三年五月，毛主席指出，在我们的干部队伍中“有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来”。毛主席还说：“照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”这里着重讲的，也是党内被资产阶级拉出去、打进来的分子最为危险。
    一九六四年七月，毛主席在讲无产阶级革命事业接班人问题的时候，提出“防止赫鲁晓夫修正主义在中国重演的问题”，提出无产阶级革命事业接班人的第一个条件就是，“他们必须是真正的马克思列宁主义者，而不是象赫鲁晓夫那样的挂着马克思列宁主义招牌的修正主义者。”
    一九六五年一月，毛主席在《农村社会主义教育运动中目前提出的一些问题》中，指出：“运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。
    近几年，毛主席又多次指出：要警惕出修正主义，特别是要警惕在中央出修正主义。
    经过几年的酝酿和准备，毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，这场大革命的主要目的，就是打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，特别是打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这是从分析现阶段我国各种错综复杂的矛盾中，抓住的主要矛盾。
    我们结合当前斗争的新形势，结合一年来的革命实践，学习《通知》的最基本的要求，是抓住主要矛盾，坚定不移地掌握斗争的方向，而不要被各种次要矛盾转移了视线，转移了斗争的大方向。
    毛主席教导我们说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。这是马克思研究资本主义社会告诉我们的方法。列宁和斯大林研究帝国主义和资本主义总危机的时候，列宁和斯大林研究苏联经济的时候，也告诉了这种方法。万千的学问家和实行家，不懂得这种方法，结果如堕烟海，找不到中心，也就找不到解决矛盾的方法。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，在阶级关系急剧变化的时候，更必须随时注意抓住主要矛盾。
    只有抓住主要矛盾，才能发展和壮大左派队伍，团结广大群众和广大干部，实现革命的大联合，最大限度地孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们要集中力量解决这个主要矛盾，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，清除他们在各个战线上散布的流毒。
    左派群众组织之间，也存在着矛盾。这种矛盾，是左派内部的是和非的矛盾。有的是在某一个问题上，一方是正确的，另一方是不正确的。有的是在某一个问题上，一方错误多些，另一方错误少些。有的是一方在这个问题上是正确的，而在那个问题上是错误的，另一方恰恰相反。上述种种，是有着原则分歧的。但是，他们之间的矛盾是次要的，他们的对立面，都是党内走资本主义道路的当权派，他们的大方向是一致的。认清了主要敌人，抓住了主要矛盾，左派群众组织之间的矛盾，就能正确地对待和解决，就不会用处理敌我矛盾的方法去对待对方。左派群众组织之间的分歧，应该用批评和自我批评的方法解决。双方的争论，可以协商解决。双方一时不能解决的次要的问题，则应该求同存异，共同对敌。这不叫无原则，不叫和稀泥，不叫折衷主义，不叫调和主义，而是实现革命大联合的正确做法，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的原则性的表现。相反，如果左派组织之间互相抓住争论的问题不放，把枝节问题看得比天还大，热衷于“打内战”，放松了对党内走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，这恰恰是没有原则性，是小团体主义、山头主义、无政府主义的恶劣表现。
    左派群众组织和认识不清而参加保守组织的群众的关系，是人民内部矛盾，而不是敌我矛盾。只要抓住主要矛盾，认清主要敌人，就会懂得受蒙蔽的保守组织的群众，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，他们是我们的阶级弟兄，应该耐心地教育他们同幕后操纵他们的坏人划清界限，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。为了最大限度孤立和彻底打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，我们必须对那些认识不清的群众做艰苦的政治思想工作。在这个问题上，我们要牢记毛主席关于相信群众的教导。我们要实行毛主席的指示，无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。受蒙蔽而参加保守组织的群众所犯的错误，是属于认识问题，我们要帮助他们解放思想，放下包袱。对他们只能说服，而不能压服，不能污辱，不能打击报复。他们退出保守组织，参加革命组织，应当表示欢迎，并且按照革命不分先后的原则，正确对待他们，不要歧视他们。他们保持原来组织，自己起来造反，扭转了政治方向，反戈一击，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同样应当表示欢迎，同样不应当歧视他们。这样做，不是右倾机会主义，不是投降主义，而是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确原则。这样做，才有利于无产阶级，有利于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，有利于胜利完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务。这样做，才能团结绝大多数群众，使自己立于不败之地。相反的做法，恰恰是有利于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    参加保守组织的群众，则应该严格要求自己，认清主要矛盾，分清敌我，掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。犯了错误，应该承认，应该改正。只要改了就好。不要感情用事，继续迷失方向。要提高警惕，不要受坏人的挑动。
    我们在学习中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的时候，应该联系实际，抓活思想，进行整风，进一步认清主要矛盾，更好地掌握斗争大方向，特别是要集中力量彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
