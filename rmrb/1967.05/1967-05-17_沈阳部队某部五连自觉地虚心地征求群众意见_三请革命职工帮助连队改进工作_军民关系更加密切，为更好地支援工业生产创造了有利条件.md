The Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Army has proactively and humbly sought public opinion from revolutionary workers three times to help the company improve its work. This has strengthened the relationship between the military and the people, creating favorable conditions for better supporting industrial production.

Editor's Note: The Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Army, in the process of supporting local industrial production, has sought opinions from revolutionary masses three times to help the company improve its work, so as to better complete the glorious mission given by Chairman Mao. This spirit of humility, caution, and willingness to learn is worth emulating.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Because we serve the people, we should not fear criticism and correction of our shortcomings." The comrades of the Fifth Company, despite achieving great success in their support work, still proactively seek the opinions of the masses, fully demonstrating their adherence to Chairman Mao's teachings and placing trust and reliance on the masses as their top priority. This approach is truly a manifestation of loving the people and uniting with the masses.

Currently, many companies, like the Fifth Company, humbly listen to the opinions of the masses in their support work for the left, industry, agriculture, military control, and military training, and have excellently completed their tasks. This undeniably proves that the People's Liberation Army is indeed a great army that serves the people wholeheartedly, and its fighters are indeed good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat firmly support and enthusiastically endorse the People's Liberation Army. We believe that in their practical work of supporting the left, industry, agriculture, military control, and military training, and in their daily interactions with the revolutionary masses, the People's Liberation Army will unite more closely with the people, fight together with them, and achieve victory together.

According to a report from the People's Daily, the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Army, in supporting industrial production, has followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "the army must unite with the people" and proactively sought opinions from revolutionary masses three times to help the company improve its work. This has strengthened the relationship between the military and the people, creating favorable conditions for better completing the task of supporting industrial production.

In early March, the Fifth Company responded to Chairman Mao's call to support the left, industry, and agriculture, and went to a certain coal mine to work with revolutionary workers and cadres to seize the revolution and promote production, achieving significant results. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuousness, and serve the Chinese people wholeheartedly." They paid great attention to the problems in their support work. One day, Company Commander Chen Shichang saw a soldier speaking for over half an hour in a one-hour meeting with a revolutionary mass organization. Chen Shichang reported this to Political Instructor Xie Endong, who also mentioned similar incidents. These incidents caught the attention of the Fifth Company's Party branch. They held a branch committee meeting to analyze the causes of these incidents and unanimously agreed that since the company began its support mission, it had achieved great success. However, some comrades attributed the success to themselves rather than to the Party and the people; they were pleased to hear compliments but disliked criticism. Everyone agreed that these incidents were a sign of disrespect for the masses, and if left unchecked, they would lead to a serious alienation from the masses, making it impossible to complete the glorious mission given by Chairman Mao to the troops. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the people's army and the mass line and decided to widely seek the opinions of revolutionary masses to help the army improve its work.

After the Fifth Company's Party branch educated all the soldiers, they all went out to seek opinions from the masses. Some went to the coal mining section, some to the office of the cadres, and some to the workers' dormitories. However, after several rounds, they only heard a series of praises. Why didn't the workers offer any criticism? The Fifth Company's Party branch realized that the lack of opinions from the masses indicated that the army itself still had problems. The company's leaders then went deep into the platoons to understand the situation and found that some soldiers feared that if the masses offered too many opinions, they would lose their authority and find it difficult to continue their work. Therefore, when asking for opinions, their attitude was not sincere enough. Thus, the masses naturally did not want to express their true feelings. The Party branch then conducted a special study on this issue and concluded that to truly let the revolutionary masses express their true feelings, they must adopt a very sincere attitude. Otherwise, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without wholehearted devotion, without the determination to look down, without the eagerness to learn, without the spirit of humbly being a student, one will definitely not be able to do it and definitely will not be able to do it well." They organized the soldiers to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and used the idea of "completely and thoroughly serving the people" to re-educate everyone, urging them to overcome selfish thoughts and humbly listen to the masses' criticisms.

The comrades of the Fifth Company went to the workers a second time, repeatedly explaining that offering opinions to the army and helping to improve its work was the greatest concern and care for the soldiers from a political and ideological standpoint. Seeing the sincere attitude of the Fifth Company's comrades, the masses were deeply moved and began to express their true feelings, offering constructive criticisms and raising issues. An old worker from the third coal mining section criticized some soldiers for not listening to the old workers' advice during underground shifts, rushing into dangerous situations even when they were clearly present. A responsible person from the revolutionary mass organization of the fourth coal mining section said that some comrades organized study sessions of Chairman Mao's works in their section without first discussing the situation with them, resulting in ineffective ideological work and superficial learning. The Fifth Company's Party branch collected the masses' opinions and presented them to the entire company, encouraging everyone to study Chairman Mao's works with these issues in mind, significantly raising the awareness of the cadres and soldiers.

The Fifth Company's request for revolutionary masses to help improve the company's work did not end there. They believed that to achieve what Chairman Mao said: "to make the army appear as the people's army in the eyes of the people," they must not only proactively seek opinions from the masses but also consciously allow the masses to supervise the behavior of the cadres and soldiers. They invited the responsible persons and old worker representatives from all revolutionary mass organizations in the mine to the company for a heart-to-heart meeting. Deputy Secretary and Company Commander Chen Shichang, on behalf of all the comrades, examined the issues of partial work substitution and alienation from the masses in some aspects and explained the future rectification measures to everyone. These measures included: first, based on the opinions of the revolutionary masses, the company decided to launch a small rectification campaign in the near future to improve ideological awareness and work methods; second, in the future, they would continuously listen to the opinions of the revolutionary masses and invite everyone to conduct a "check-up" for the entire company every month to help prevent alienation from the masses; third, they would educate comrades who had poor relationships with the masses to proactively have heart-to-heart talks with them.

The responsible persons from the revolutionary mass organizations were satisfied with the Fifth Company's self-examination and measures to improve work. They said, "The army's support for local areas has achieved great success and made significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They still seek opinions from the masses time and again, examine their work, and wholeheartedly serve the people. They are truly good soldiers of Chairman Mao."

    沈阳部队某部五连自觉地虚心地征求群众意见
    三请革命职工帮助连队改进工作
    军民关系更加密切，为更好地支援工业生产创造了有利条件
    编者按：人民解放军沈阳部队某部五连，在支援地方工业生产的过程中，三请革命群众给连队提意见，帮助连队改进工作，以便更好地完成毛主席交给的光荣任务。这种谦虚、谨慎，甘当小学生的精神，是很值得学习的。
    毛主席教导我们：“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出。”五连同志在支工中取得巨大成绩的情况下，仍然主动地征求群众的意见，充分表明他们坚决遵循毛主席的教导，把相信群众、依靠群众放到首要位置。这样做，就是真正爱民，就能真正和群众打成一片。
    目前，我们有许许多多的连队，也象五连一样，在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训工作中，虚心地听取群众意见，出色地完成了自己的任务。这就无可辩驳地证明了：人民解放军不愧是全心全意为人民服务的伟大的军队，人民解放军的指战员不愧是毛主席的好战士。
    广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众是坚决支持和热烈拥护人民解放军的。我们相信，人民解放军在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项实际工作中，在与广大革命群众朝夕相处中，一定会更加紧密地与人民群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    本报讯　人民解放军沈阳部队某部五连在支援工业生产中，遵照毛主席“军队须和民众打成一片”的教导，自觉地主动地三请革命群众提意见，帮助连队改进工作，更加密切了军队和群众的关系，为更好地完成支援工业生产的任务创造了有利条件。
    三月初，五连响应毛主席提出的支左、支工、支农的伟大号召，到某煤矿协同革命职工和革命干部一起抓革命、促生产，取得了不少成就。他们牢记毛主席的“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务”的教导，十分注意支援工作中的问题。一天，连长陈世昌看到一个战士在同革命群众组织一起开学习会时，在一个小时的会议中，他一个人就滔滔不绝地讲了半个多小时。陈世昌把这个情况告诉了指导员谢恩东，指导员也谈了一些类似的现象。这些现象引起了五连党支部的注意。他们召开了支委会议，分析这些现象产生的原因，一致认为，连队执行支工任务以来，取得了很大成绩；但是，有的同志不是把成绩记在党和人民的帐上，而是挂在个人的头上；高兴听顺耳的话，不乐意听逆耳的话。大家认为，这种现象是不尊重群众的表现，发展下去，就会严重脱离群众，就不能完成毛主席交给部队的光荣任务。他们反复学习了毛主席有关人民军队和群众路线的论述，决定广泛地征求革命群众的意见，请他们帮助部队改进工作。
    五连党支部向全连同志进行了教育之后，战士们便全部出动，有的到采煤段，有的到干部办公室，有的到工人宿舍，征求革命群众的意见。可是他们跑了几圈，听到的却是一大串表扬。为什么工人同志不提批评意见呢？五连党支部意识到，群众不提意见，正说明部队本身还有问题。连的领导同志便深入班排了解情况，发现原来有的战士怕群众提多了意见，自己丧失了威信，今后不好开展工作，因此，请别人提意见时，态度不够诚恳。这样，群众当然不愿说出心里话。党支部针对这个问题，又进行了专门研究，认为要让革命群众真正说出他们的心里话，必须采取十分诚恳的态度，否则，就象毛主席指出的：“没有满腔的热忱，没有眼睛向下的决心，没有求知的渴望，没有放下臭架子、甘当小学生的精神，是一定不能做，也一定做不好的。”他们组织战士学习了“老三篇”，用“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想，向大家进行了再教育，要大家克服私心杂念，恭恭敬敬地去听取群众的批评意见。
    五连同志第二次到工人群众中去，反复地说明给部队提意见，帮助改进工作，是从政治思想上对子弟兵的最大关怀和最大爱护。群众见五连同志态度诚恳，深受感动，便纷纷说出自己的心里话，善意地提意见，摆问题。采煤三段一位老工人批评有的战士下井跟班劳动时，不注意听老工人的话，有些地方明明有险情，也要硬往上冲。采煤四段革命群众组织一位负责人说，有的同志在他们段组织学习毛主席著作，有时不先跟他们一起研究情况，结果，活思想抓得不准，学习走了过场。五连党支部把群众的意见集中起来，交给全连同志，让大家带着问题活学活用毛主席著作进行讨论，大大提高了干部和战士的觉悟。
    五连请革命群众帮助连队改进工作，并没有到此结束。他们认为，要做到象毛主席所说的那样：“使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队”，不仅要主动地请群众提意见，还要自觉地让群众监督干部和战士的言行。他们把全矿各个革命群众组织的负责人和老工人代表请到连队来，同他们开交心会。支部副书记、连长陈世昌代表全连同志检查了在某些方面包办代替、脱离群众的问题，并把今后改正的办法，向大家作了交代。这些办法是：一、根据革命群众提出的意见，连队决定在最近开展一次小整风，提高思想认识，切实改进工作；二、今后经常不断听取革命群众的意见，每隔一个月，请大家给全连同志进行一次“会诊”，帮助他们切实防止脱离群众的倾向；三、教育同群众关系搞得不够融洽的同志，启发他们自觉地跟群众谈心。
    革命群众组织的同志对五连的检查和改进工作的措施很满意。他们说，军队支援地方，取得了很大的成绩，对无产阶级文化大革命做出了重大的贡献，还这样一而再、再而三地请群众提意见，检查工作，这样全心全意为人民服务，真不愧是毛主席的好战士。
