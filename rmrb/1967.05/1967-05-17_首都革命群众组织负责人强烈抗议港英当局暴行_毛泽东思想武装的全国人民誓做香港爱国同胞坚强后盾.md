Capital revolutionary mass organizations leaders strongly protest the atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong. The people of the entire nation, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, vow to be the steadfast backbone of Hong Kong patriots.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 16th, leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in the capital have issued statements regarding the British authorities in Hong Kong colluding with the U.S. imperialists to brazenly oppose China and brutally suppress the people of Hong Kong. They solemnly pointed out: Our great leader Chairman Mao, and our powerful socialist motherland, are the strong backing of Hong Kong patriots; the people of the entire nation, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are the steadfast backbone of Hong Kong patriots.

The leader of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Representative Congress said: When we heard the news of the British authorities in Hong Kong brutally suppressing Chinese workers and compatriots in Hong Kong, we were extremely indignant. We firmly support the solemn statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British authorities must unconditionally accept the five demands proposed by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong have long planned to brutally suppress our Hong Kong patriots. This is part of the British government's conspiracy with U.S. imperialism to oppose China. Especially towards our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, they are extremely afraid and hate it, and therefore attempt to use high-pressure tactics to resist the influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the great influence of the Cultural Revolution is unstoppable. It greatly inspires the struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world for liberation, and also greatly inspires the just struggles of Hong Kong patriots. Hong Kong patriots study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, fear no violence, and fight bravely. They are truly outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. We, the working class of the capital, solemnly warn British imperialism: the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. We, the revolutionary factions of the capital's factories, mines, and enterprises, vow to be the steadfast backbone of Hong Kong patriots. We are determined to fight this battle to the end!

The leader of the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Congress said: We poor and lower-middle peasants firmly support the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British authorities in Hong Kong and U.S. and Soviet revisionists are in cahoots, colluding to oppose China. The British authorities in Hong Kong brutally suppress compatriots in Hong Kong, which is a mad provocation by the British government against the 700 million Chinese people. It is a major exposure of their long-term attempt to resist the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The more the enemy sabotages the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the more we must carry it out well, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and eliminate all their poisonous influences. The more the enemy fears Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. We firmly support the heroic struggle of Hong Kong compatriots until victory is achieved.

The leader of the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in the capital said: We, the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in the capital, most firmly support the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and most firmly support the anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle of Hong Kong compatriots. We, the Red Guards of the capital, solemnly warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: in front of the Red Guards of the capital, you had better behave yourselves. You insist on opposing China, and there will be no good outcome.

The leader of the Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee of Middle Schools in Beijing said: The Red Guards of China strongly protest against British imperialism! From the day we were born, we have taken the great vow to strongly oppose imperialism, strongly oppose revisionism, and strongly oppose reactionaries of all countries, using the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to fight for a red world. We firmly support the just struggle of Hong Kong patriots until the final victory is achieved.

The All-China Journalists Association issued a statement, strongly protesting the British authorities in Hong Kong's brutal suppression of our Hong Kong patriots and the beating of Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch reporter Si Tuqiang and Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" reporters Yang Zuku and Huang Ze who were on the scene reporting. The statement said that the British authorities in Hong Kong's mad anti-China atrocities are premeditated, a serious provocation against the Chinese people, and absolutely intolerable. The fact that the British authorities in Hong Kong beat our reporters who were on the scene reporting only shows that you are afraid of the truth and afraid of Chinese reporters exposing the true picture of your fascist atrocities. We warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: truth cannot be strangled, and facts cannot be covered up. Chinese journalists firmly support the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and firmly support the heroic struggle of Hong Kong compatriots. The British authorities in Hong Kong must guarantee the personal safety and freedom of reporting of Chinese journalists, must immediately stop all fascist atrocities, severely punish the perpetrators who beat Chinese journalists, and apologize to our journalists. If the British authorities in Hong Kong insist on their own way, then all serious consequences must be borne by the British authorities in Hong Kong.

    首都革命群众组织负责人强烈抗议港英当局暴行
    毛泽东思想武装的全国人民誓做香港爱国同胞坚强后盾
    据新华社十六日讯　首都各革命群众组织的负责人，就香港英国当局勾结美帝猖狂反华，血腥镇压香港同胞的法西斯暴行，发表谈话。他们庄严指出：我们伟大的领袖毛主席，我们强大的社会主义祖国，是香港爱国同胞的强大靠山；用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的全国人民，是香港爱国同胞的坚强后盾。
    北京市革命职工代表会议负责人说：当我们听到香港英国当局血腥镇压香港中国工人和香港同胞的消息后，我们感到极大的愤慨。我们坚决拥护我国外交部的严正声明，英国当局必须无条件接受我国外交部提出的五项要求。他指出，香港英国当局血腥镇压我香港爱国同胞蓄谋已久。这是英国政府勾结美帝国主义反对中国的阴谋的一部分。特别是对我们最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，更是怕得要死，恨得要命，因此妄图以高压手段抵制我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响。但是，文化大革命的伟大影响是遏制不了的，它极大地鼓舞着世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的斗争，也极大地鼓舞着香港爱国同胞的正义斗争。香港爱国同胞活学活用毛主席著作，发扬无产阶级的革命精神，不畏强暴，英勇斗争，不愧是中华民族的优秀儿女。我们首都工人阶级要严正警告英帝国主义：用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大中国人民不是好惹的。我们首都厂矿企业的无产阶级革命派，誓作香港爱国同胞的坚强后盾，我们决心把这场斗争进行到底！
    北京市贫下中农代表会议负责人说：我们贫下中农最坚决地拥护我国外交部的声明，香港英国当局和美帝、苏修穿一条裤子，串通一气反华。香港英国当局血腥镇压香港同胞，这是英国政府对七亿中国人民的疯狂挑衅，是它长期以来妄图抵制我国无产阶级文化大革命伟大影响的一次大暴露。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”敌人越是破坏无产阶级文化大革命，我们就越要把无产阶级文化大革命搞好，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批深批透、斗倒斗臭，肃清他们的一切流毒。敌人越是害怕毛泽东思想，我们越要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们坚决支持香港同胞的英勇斗争，直到取得胜利。
    首都大专院校红代会负责人说：我们首都大专院校红代会最最坚决地支持我国外交部的声明，最最坚决支持香港同胞的反帝爱国斗争。我们首都红卫兵严正警告香港英国当局：在首都红卫兵面前，你们要放老实点，你们坚持反华，决没有好下场。
    北京市中学红代会负责人说：中国红卫兵向英帝国主义提出最最严重的抗议！我们红卫兵从诞生那一天起，就立下了伟大的志愿——大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造各国反动派的反，用毛泽东思想的锐利武器，杀出一个红彤彤的新世界。我们坚决支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争，直到取得最后胜利。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会发表声明，强烈抗议香港英国当局血腥镇压我香港爱国同胞，和殴打在现场采访的新华社香港分社记者司徒强以及香港《大公报》记者杨祖坤、黄泽等人的法西斯暴行。声明说，港英当局疯狂的反华暴行，是蓄谋已久的，是对中国人民的严重挑衅，是绝对不能容忍的。香港英国当局殴打我国在现场进行采访的记者这一事实，只能说明你们害怕真理，害怕中国记者如实地揭露你们的法西斯暴行的真象。我们要警告港英当局，真理是扼杀不了的，事实是掩盖不住的。中国新闻工作者坚决拥护我国外交部的声明，并坚决支持香港同胞的英勇斗争。香港英国当局必须保证中国记者的人身安全和采访自由，必须立即停止一切法西斯暴行，严惩殴打中国记者的凶手，并向我记者道歉。如果香港英国当局一意孤行，那么一切严重后果必须由香港英国当局承担。
