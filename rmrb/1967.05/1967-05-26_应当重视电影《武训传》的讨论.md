Title: The Discussion on the Film "The Life of Wu Xun" Should Be Taken Seriously
Author: Mao Zedong
Date: 1967-05-26
Edition: 1

The issues raised by the film "The Life of Wu Xun" are fundamental in nature. People like Wu Xun, living in the late Qing Dynasty during the great struggle of the Chinese people against foreign invaders and domestic feudal rulers, did not touch even a single hair of the feudal economic base and its superstructure. Instead, they fervently promoted feudal culture. To obtain a position to promote feudal culture, they groveled before the reactionary feudal rulers. Such despicable behavior, should we sing its praises? To sing the praises of such despicable behavior to the people, even using the revolutionary banner of "serving the people" to do so, even using the failure of the peasant revolution as a contrast to sing its praises, can we tolerate this? To acknowledge or tolerate such praise is to acknowledge or tolerate the reactionary propaganda that slanders the peasant revolutionary struggle, slanders Chinese history, and slanders the Chinese nation as legitimate propaganda.

The appearance of the film "The Life of Wu Xun," and the fact that so many people sing its praises, shows the extent of the ideological confusion in our cultural circles!

In the eyes of many authors, the development of history is not about replacing old things with new things, but about making various efforts to preserve old things and prevent their demise. It is not about using class struggle to overthrow the reactionary feudal rulers who should be overthrown, but about negating the class struggle of the oppressed people, surrendering to the reactionary feudal rulers, and serving them like Wu Xun. Our authors do not study the enemies who oppressed the Chinese people in the past, nor do they study whether there is anything praiseworthy about those who surrendered to these enemies and served them. Our authors also do not study the new social and economic forms, new class forces, new figures, and new ideas that have emerged in the more than a hundred years since the Opium War of 1840, fighting against the old social and economic forms and their superstructures (politics, culture, etc.), to determine what should be praised or sung about, what should not be praised or sung about, and what should be opposed.

It is particularly noteworthy that some self-proclaimed Marxists within the Communist Party. They have learned the history of social development—the materialist conception of history—but when faced with specific historical events, specific historical figures (such as Wu Xun), and specific anti-historical ideas (such as the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and other works about Wu Xun), they lose their critical ability. Some even surrender to these reactionary ideas. Has bourgeois reactionary thought infiltrated the fighting Communist Party? Where has the Marxism that some Communist Party members claim to have learned gone?

For the above reasons, a discussion on the film "The Life of Wu Xun" and other related works and articles about Wu Xun should be launched to thoroughly clarify the confused thoughts on this issue.

    应当重视电影《武训传》的讨论
    （一九五一年五月二十日）
    毛泽东
    《武训传》所提出的问题带有根本的性质。象武训那样的人，处在清朝末年中国人民反对外国侵略者和反对国内的反动封建统治者的伟大斗争的时代，根本不去触动封建经济基础及其上层建筑的一根毫毛，反而狂热地宣传封建文化，并为了取得自己所没有的宣传封建文化的地位，就对反动的封建统治者竭尽奴颜婢膝的能事，这种丑恶的行为，难道是我们所应当歌颂的吗？向着人民群众歌颂这种丑恶的行为，甚至打出“为人民服务”的革命旗号来歌颂，甚至用革命的农民斗争的失败作为反衬来歌颂，这难道是我们所能够容忍的吗？承认或者容忍这种歌颂，就是承认或者容忍污蔑农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史，污蔑中国民族的反动宣传为正当的宣传。
    电影《武训传》的出现，特别是对于武训和电影《武训传》的歌颂竟至如此之多，说明了我国文化界的思想混乱达到了何等的程度！
    在许多作者看来，历史的发展不是以新事物代替旧事物，而是以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡；不是以阶级斗争去推翻应当推翻的反动的封建统治者，而是象武训那样否定被压迫人民的阶级斗争，向反动的封建统治者投降。我们的作者们不去研究过去历史中压迫中国人民的敌人是些什么人，向这些敌人投降并为他们服务的人是否有值得称赞的地方。我们的作者们也不去研究自从一八四○年鸦片战争以来的一百多年中，中国发生了一些什么向着旧的社会经济形态及其上层建筑（政治、文化等等）作斗争的新的社会经济形态，新的阶级力量，新的人物和新的思想，而去决定什么东西是应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是不应当称赞或歌颂的，什么东西是应当反对的。
    特别值得注意的，是一些号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员。他们学得了社会发展史——历史唯物论，但是一遇到具体的历史事件，具体的历史人物（如象武训），具体的反历史的思想（如象电影《武训传》及其他关于武训的著作），就丧失了批判的能力，有些人则竟至向这种反动思想投降。资产阶级的反动思想侵入了战斗的共产党，这难道不是事实吗？一些共产党员自称已经学得的马克思主义，究竟跑到什么地方去了呢？
    为了上述种种缘故，应当展开关于电影《武训传》及其他有关武训的著作和论文的讨论，求得彻底地澄清在这个问题上的混乱思想。	这是毛泽东同志为《人民日报》写的社论的摘录。
