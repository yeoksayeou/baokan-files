Title: Seize the Pen for the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction

One piece of good news follows another, and one major event follows another. Just as we are enthusiastically celebrating the first anniversary of the publication of the Party Central Committee's "Notice," we are now, with even greater excitement, commemorating the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This adds boundless strength and greater confidence to our efforts to carry out the Cultural Revolution even better.

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" creatively formulated the most complete, thorough, and correct proletarian literary and artistic line, serving as a beacon guiding us from one victory to another.

Over the past 25 years, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line has engaged in sharp struggles with the revisionist literary and artistic line. With the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, a small clique of anti-revolutionary revisionists, including Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang, have used the cultural power they have seized to openly oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Over the past 25 years, the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line and the revisionist literary and artistic line has primarily revolved around the question of whom to serve.

In his "Talks," Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to be created for them and for their use."

Has this wise directive been implemented in the literary and artistic circles? No. Take the theater, for example. For the past decade or so, the stage has been filled with plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties—old relics peddling feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist black goods.

Before the Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants often pondered this question: Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we workers, peasants, and soldiers have accomplished many earth-shaking feats and produced many heroic and model figures. Why can't they be featured on stage? Now, it is the era of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants taking the lead. Why are the protagonists in many plays and films not workers and poor and lower-middle peasants?

After a year of the Cultural Revolution, the problem has become clear: The literary and artistic circles have been seized by the revisionist black line.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the fundamental question of the revolution is the question of state power. As early as in the "Talks," he clearly pointed out: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, and among them, we can also say there are two fronts, the cultural front and the military front. We must rely on the armed forces to defeat the enemy. But having only this kind of force is not enough; we must also have a cultural force." In history, any class, before seizing state power, always first prepares public opinion. Who controls this cultural force is of great significance. If it is controlled by the proletariat, it creates public opinion for the proletariat to seize power, consolidate, and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat; if it is controlled by the bourgeoisie and revisionists, it creates public opinion for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the restoration of capitalism. We must never underestimate the power of the pen!

Before the Cultural Revolution, the leadership of the cultural realm was usurped by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party; literature and art became their tools for anti-Party and anti-socialist activities and for restoring capitalism. Some people used to think that painting, acting, making movies, and writing articles were just for entertainment! Even if there were problems, it was just a "pen and ink lawsuit," nothing serious. How ignorant and dangerous that is! The Cultural Revolution has shown us many shocking things: Painting, acting, making movies, and writing articles are all filled with sharp and complex class struggles.

The "Notice" of May 16, 1966, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, sounded the death knell for the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and their backers who had seized power in the cultural realm. The victories achieved in the Cultural Revolution over the past year have declared the complete bankruptcy of their revisionist literary and artistic line.

"Though the iron gate of the pass is hard to cross, we now stride forward from the start." On the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks," we must regard the victories we have already achieved as the first step of a long march. With the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, we must thoroughly criticize and expose the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, fight him to the end, and expose him for what he is. We must thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the "Cultivation" and the "February Outline." We must overthrow the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their backers, seize back the Party, government, economic, and cultural powers they have usurped, and firmly grasp the pen in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction!

    把笔杆子掌握在无产阶级革命派手里
    山西省革命委员会副主任  昔阳大寨大队党支部书记  陈永贵
    喜事一宗接一宗，大事一件挨一件。正当我们热烈欢呼党中央的《通知》发表一周年的时候，又以极其兴奋的心情来纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，这对于我们把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，增添了无穷无尽的力量，鼓起了更大的信心。
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，创造性地制定了最完整、最彻底、最正确的无产阶级文艺路线，是一盏光辉的指路明灯，它指引着我们从胜利走向胜利。
    二十五年来，毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，与修正主义的文艺路线，进行了尖锐的斗争。在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用他们所窃取的文化大权，明目张胆地与毛主席的革命文艺路线相对抗。
    二十五年来，毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线与修正主义文艺路线的斗争，主要围绕在为谁服务的问题上。
    毛主席在《讲话》中明明白白指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    毛主席的这一英明指示，在文艺界是不是贯彻了呢？没有。就拿戏剧来说吧，十几年来，舞台上，演的还是帝王将相、才子佳人那套老古董，贩卖的是封、资、修黑货。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，我们贫下中农就常常思谋这个问题：在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们工农兵做出了许多惊天动地的事业，出现了许多英雄模范人物，为什么上不了舞台？现在，是工人阶级、贫下中农当家做主的时代，为什么许多戏剧、电影的主人公不是工人阶级和贫下中农？
    经过一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，问题已经完全清楚了：原来，文艺界被修正主义的文艺黑线专了我们的政。
    毛主席教导我们，革命的根本问题是政权问题。早在《讲话》中就明确指出：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队”。历史上，任何一个阶级，在夺取政权之前，总是先制造舆论准备。这支文化的军队掌握在谁手里，关系太大了。掌握在无产阶级手里，它就为无产阶级夺取政权、巩固和发展无产阶级专政制造舆论；要是掌握在资产阶级、修正主义分子手里，它就为资产阶级专政和复辟资本主义制造舆论。千万可不能小看这笔杆子啊！
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，文化领域的领导权，被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺了；文艺成为他们反党反社会主义，复辟资本主义的舆论工具。有的人曾经认为，绘画，演戏，拍电影，写文章，是看热闹哩！有点问题，也不过是打“笔墨官司”，没有什么了不起。这是多么糊涂，多么危险啊！文化大革命中许多惊心动魄的事情，使人民懂得了：绘画，演戏，拍电影，写文章，里边都充满着尖锐的复杂的阶级斗争。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，给窃取文化战线上大权的彭真、陆定一、周扬等反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台敲响了丧钟，一年来的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的一个又一个胜利，宣告了他们的修正主义文艺路线的彻底破产。
    “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”在纪念毛主席《讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，我们要把已取得的胜利，当作万里长征的第一步，要以不断革命、彻底革命的精神，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透，斗倒、斗臭，要把《修养》《二月提纲》批深、批透、批倒、批臭，要把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的后台打翻在地，要把他们窃取的党、政、财、文大权统统夺过来，把笔杆子牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里！
