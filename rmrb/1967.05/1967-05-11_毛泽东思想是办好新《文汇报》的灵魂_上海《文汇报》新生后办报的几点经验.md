The editorial board of the *Red Flag* magazine: Recently, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the *Wen Hui Bao* in Shanghai has seriously summarized the work of the newspaper over the past three months since its rebirth. This summary of experience was written by the comrades of the *Wen Hui Bao* Revolutionary Committee and the reporters of this magazine together.

The experience of the *Wen Hui Bao* tells us that the reason why the *Wen Hui Bao* has become a revolutionary and critical newspaper of the proletariat is fundamentally because it has taken Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of running the newspaper. This experience is not only significant for running newspapers but also for other work.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great undertaking. In this great revolution, the broad masses of revolutionaries have created extremely rich experiences of struggle. This is a precious spiritual wealth. The movement is rapidly developing, and new things are emerging one after another. The proletarian revolutionary faction should take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, and timely summarize these experiences scientifically. Chairman Mao said: "What we have felt, we cannot immediately understand it, only what we have understood can we feel it more deeply." Through summarization, we can raise our sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, deeply understand the characteristics and laws of the movement, increase self-awareness, reduce blindness, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better.

The comrades of the *Wen Hui Bao* have set a good example for the proletarian revolutionary faction by timely summarizing their work over the past period.

In the red storm of the "January Revolution" that shook the world, the *Wen Hui Bao* was reborn. Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, enthusiastically affirmed and supported this new thing, giving it a high evaluation. We, the revolutionary staff of the *Wen Hui Bao*, feel from the bottom of our hearts that no one is as dear as Chairman Mao; all words and deeds boil down to one sentence: forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought!

In the more than three months since its rebirth, the *Wen Hui Bao* has gained some good experiences, the most fundamental and important of which is: to run a newspaper well, one must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, thoroughly revolutionize, and continuously revolutionize.

Treating the propagation and defense of Mao Zedong Thought as the highest combat mission of the newspaper

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the *Wen Hui Bao* has an infinite love and loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. In the first issue of the new *Wen Hui Bao*, we solemnly declared to the Party and the people: "Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of running the new *Wen Hui Bao*. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and treat the propagation and defense of Mao Zedong Thought as the highest combat mission of the new *Wen Hui Bao*."

The new *Wen Hui Bao* has, in response to the actual problems in the struggle, timely compiled and published Chairman Mao's quotations on various topics, enabling the broad masses to grasp the policies and guide their actions according to Chairman Mao's teachings, so that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops victoriously along the revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. We have successively compiled and published special topics of Chairman Mao's quotations on "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," "On the Struggle for Power," "Policy on Cadres," "Save Money and Make Revolution," "Rectification," and so on. At critical moments in the revolutionary situation, we have also republished Chairman Mao's relevant works according to the needs of the struggle. For example, when the proletarian revolutionary faction was seizing power on the basis of great unity, we timely published Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" to address the problems in great unity. After the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai achieved a decisive victory in the struggle for power and established the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, we published Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." After publishing a series of editorials such as "Expose Anarchism," "Expose Careerism," "Expose Sectarianism," and so on, we republished Chairman Mao's evergreen work "The Three Constantly Read Articles" to uproot individualism, that is, the poisonous root of "self."

The new *Wen Hui Bao* strives to solve the problems in the actual struggle with Mao Zedong Thought in a timely manner. Defeating counter-revolutionary economism and thoroughly smashing the new counterattack of the capitalist reactionary line is a major battle related to the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai. The new *Wen Hui Bao* was the vanguard in this battle. At that time, a small clique of capitalists in the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee used their power to spread a counter-revolutionary economism wind. It was at this moment that the newspaper received a leaflet titled "An Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" signed by the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters and other revolutionary mass organizations. Should the leaflet be published? The small clique of capitalists in the Party could spread the counter-revolutionary economism wind because they had power. This leaflet was about the struggle for power. It should be published! This leaflet was finally published in a prominent position on the first page. The newspaper publishing a leaflet broke the old framework of the *Wen Hui Bao* for many years. "An Open Letter to the People of Shanghai" is another great wall poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country. Once published, it received high praise from our great leader Chairman Mao and was personally decided to be reprinted in the *People's Daily* and broadcast nationwide.

To thoroughly defeat counter-revolutionary economism, the *Wen Hui Bao* launched a "people's war" in propaganda. On January 9, it published an "Urgent Notice" signed by various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai to oppose counter-revolutionary economism. On January 10, it published on the first page Chairman Mao's special quotations on "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production" and the editorial "Down with Economism." The battle became more intense. In nearly a month, we heavily bombarded counter-revolutionary economism with cannons, using editorials, commentaries, articles, reports, and other weapons to fiercely attack it. Wherever the counter-revolutionary economism wind blew, we attacked it. From cities to the countryside, from industrial and mining enterprises to financial and commercial departments, we relentlessly pursued and attacked, driving counter-revolutionary economism to a state of defeat, like a rat crossing the street, with nowhere to hide.

We deeply feel that a newspaper must use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to hit the "target" of the actual struggle to propagate the masses and guide the movement.

Maintaining a correct class stance and holding high a clear combat banner

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear. We Communists have always believed that hiding one's views is shameful. The newspapers run by our Party and all the propaganda work done by our Party must be lively, clear, sharp, and never hesitant." The new *Wen Hui Bao* is run according to this instruction from Chairman Mao.

A newspaper is an important battlefield of class struggle. A newspaper of the proletarian revolutionary faction is one that dares to speak for the proletarian revolutionary faction, firmly stands on one side, holds high a clear banner, is sharp and outspoken, dares to poke the "hornet's nest" of class struggle, and is not afraid of opposition.

There used to be a saying that a newspaper should reflect reality but also maintain a certain distance from it. This "theory" of journalism has long constrained the hands and feet of newspaper workers, and many newspaper workers have become "good guys," with reports and articles on the newspaper often being things that are smoothed out and bland. Now, this fallacy has been thrown into the trash can, and a bold and daring fighting style of the proletarian revolutionary faction has been established in the newspaper office.

To run the newspaper with a clear banner and sharp and outspoken style, the new *Wen Hui Bao* attaches great importance to writing good commentaries. To write good commentaries, one must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction, have a clear love and hate, share life and death with them, and speak for them. If you are a conservative, you will never be able to write a commentary that boosts the morale of the revolutionary faction, and even if others write it, you won't dare to publish it. The editorial "Long Live the Reason of Revolutionary Rebellion" published on January 6 was written as early as mid-December 1966. At that time, the proletarian revolutionary faction in the newspaper ordered the previous person in charge to publish it. This person in charge was afraid of losing his official position and dared not publish it. After the revolutionary faction seized power on the third day, it published this editorial in the headline position on the first page, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction and greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

Commentaries are a sharp sword thrown into the class struggle by the newspaper. Where the struggle is the most intense, this weapon is swung there. In the storm of the "January Revolution," we witnessed the crimes of counter-revolutionary economism, filled with indignation, and took up this sharp sword to fiercely attack this enemy. In more than twenty days, we successively published nine editorials, attacking counter-revolutionary economism from industry, agriculture, commerce, and the sending of educated youth to the countryside. In addition, we published four editorial notes accompanying various reports and articles, fiercely attacking counter-revolutionary economism.

The publication of the commentary by the editorial board of the fifth issue of the *Red Flag* magazine and the article by Comrade Chen Boda sounded the charge for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. The new *Wen Hui Bao* closely followed this new situation of the great criticism, successively publishing editorials such as "Thoroughly Criticize China's Khrushchev" and "Criticize 'Cultivation'" and publishing many articles by the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary youngsters exposing and criticizing the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and their "Cultivation," launching a high tide of mass criticism and launching a fierce attack on China's Khrushchev.

Through the great criticism movement, the revolutionary Red Guards of the Sixth Girls' Middle School in Shanghai achieved revolutionary great unity. We believe that their experience is very important and has universal significance. On April 9, it was published in a prominent position on the first page, and the editorial "Further Discussion on Promoting Great Unity in the Great Criticism" was written that night. After the experience of the Sixth Girls' Middle School was published, it once again received the support and praise of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Many commentaries of the new *Wen Hui Bao* were not written in a closed room but were produced in the debate with opposing ideas. For example, the editorials such as "The Direction of the Struggle for Cadres in the Neighborhoods is Wrong!" were all written after fierce debates with those holding opposite views. Debate is a good social survey and also an effective method to grasp living thoughts. Commentaries written after debates have opposing views and a "gunpowder" flavor, making them more combative.

To strengthen the combativeness of commentaries, it is necessary to closely follow the latest instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and closely watch the problems in the actual struggle. Once a problem is discovered, write immediately. What should be published today should not be delayed until tomorrow, and what should be written today should not be delayed until tomorrow. For example, the editorial "Grasp Revolution, Promote Spring Plowing" on February 7 and the editorial "Revolutionary Cadres 'Charge' to the Front Line in the Countryside" on February 12 were both written overnight after discovering important articles in the submissions. Again, it was learned that some comrades did not understand the revolution of cadres very well and had some incorrect views. On February 18, we wrote the editorial "Revolution Has No Order" and proposed to welcome those who want to revolutionize with enthusiasm. Today's revolution, today's welcome; tomorrow's revolution, tomorrow's welcome.

Firmly implementing Chairman Mao's line of running a newspaper by the masses

Chairman Mao said: "Our newspapers should also be run by everyone, by all the people, and by the whole Party, and not just by a few people closing the door to run."

The old *Wen Hui Bao*, under the control of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, could not possibly implement the line of running a newspaper by the masses but relied on a few "experts" to run the newspaper, closing the door to run the newspaper. Some reactionary academic "authorities" were the pillars of the old *Wen Hui Bao*, and they spread poison, making the newspaper full of filth. The bourgeois line of running a newspaper was deeply rooted in the newspaper office.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction of the *Wen Hui Bao* seized power, they immediately grasped the revolution and vigorously criticized the bourgeois line of running a newspaper. We believe that the broad proletarian revolutionary faction is the strong backbone of the new *Wen Hui Bao*. To run the newspaper well, we must follow the mass line, rely on the masses to run the newspaper, and open the door to run the newspaper. Soon after the *Wen Hui Bao* was reborn, it invited comrades from all revolutionary mass organizations in the city to discuss specific measures to run the *Wen Hui Bao* well. It also held symposiums, individual visits, and other forms to actively ask the broad proletarian revolutionary faction to reflect on the situation, provide clues, offer advice, and think of ways. Every time revolutionary comrades proposed good suggestions, we immediately accepted them humbly. The brilliant work of Chairman Mao "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" was published after accepting the suggestions of revolutionary comrades. The editorial "Expose Careerism" was written after being inspired by the conversation with the Red Guards in Beijing. The reporter's commentaries such as "Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels Launch a General Offensive Against the Bourgeois Reactionary Line" reflecting the situation of the cultural revolution in Shanghai were all written with the help of relevant revolutionary mass organizations.

To better spread the voice of the proletarian revolutionary faction, the new *Wen Hui Bao* opened the columns "Forum of Revolutionary Rebels" and "Letters from Revolutionary Masses." For some important articles and letters, editorials or editorial notes were also added.

Through practice, we realized that whether or not to follow the mass line in running a newspaper, whether or not to pay attention to mass work, is not a small problem but a big problem, a principle problem that distinguishes the proletarian line of running a newspaper from the bourgeois line of running a newspaper.

In the struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works to promote ideological revolutionization

After the *Wen Hui Bao* was reborn, the proletarian revolutionary faction in the newspaper office put forward a resounding slogan: "Learn from the revolutionary faction, propagate the revolutionary faction, strive to be the revolutionary faction!"

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the *Wen Hui Bao* strives to learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. When the struggle is difficult, we draw strength from "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," persist in the struggle, and fight to the end. When some achievements are made, we take "Modesty promotes progress, arrogance leads to backwardness" as our motto, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and strictly examine all aspects of our work. Even if there is a hint of arrogance and complacency, we correct it immediately. We use "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party" as weapons to carry out rectification, sweep away the "self" in our minds, and firmly establish the proletarian worldview with "public" as the top priority. After seizing power, we firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, strive to work with revolutionary cadres, and achieve the "three-in-one combination" of revolution. For cadres who have made serious mistakes, we do not kill them with one blow but, according to Chairman Mao's policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," use the method of working while reforming to help these cadres correct their mistakes. We deeply feel that Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, and we cannot be separated from it for a moment; if we are separated from it at any time, we will lose our direction and take the wrong path at that time.

We follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "Newspaper workers, in order to educate the masses, must first learn from the masses" and go deep into the front line of the struggle to learn from the broad proletarian revolutionary faction. This is an important key to promoting the ideological revolutionization of cadres and writing high-quality news reports. Where the struggle is the most intense, go there. When reporters go down to interview, they often participate in the struggle as combatants, participating in criticism meetings, struggle meetings, and debate meetings. Only by going deep into the front line can reporters discover new things in the struggle and write high-quality reports.

Recently, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the *Wen Hui Bao* has responded to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, carried out open rectification, and firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "We must always maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impetuosity, and we must always maintain the style of hard struggle." We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome the shortcomings and mistakes in our work, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    毛泽东思想是办好新《文汇报》的灵魂
    ——上海《文汇报》新生后办报的几点经验
    《红旗》杂志编者按：最近，上海《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派，认真总结了报纸新生以后三个多月来的工作。这个经验总结，是《文汇报》革命委员会的同志和本刊记者一起研究写成的。
    《文汇报》的经验告诉我们，《文汇报》所以成为一张无产阶级的革命的批判的报纸，最根本的就是把毛泽东思想作为办报的灵魂。这个经验，不仅对于办报，而且对于其他各项工作，都具有普遍意义。
    无产阶级文化大革命是一个史无前例的伟大创举。在这场大革命中，广大革命群众创造了极其丰富的斗争经验。这是一项宝贵的精神财富。运动在迅速地发展着，新东西层出不穷。无产阶级革命派应当以毛泽东思想为指南，对经验及时给以科学的总结。毛主席说：“感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。”经过总结，使感性认识提高到理性认识，才能深刻地认识运动的特点和规律性，提高自觉性，减少盲目性，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
    《文汇报》的同志，对前一段的工作及时进行总结的做法，为无产阶级革命派树立了一个很好的榜样。
    在震撼世界的“一月革命”的红色风暴中，《文汇报》获得了新生。我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，满腔热情地肯定和支持了这个新事物，作了高度的评价。我们《文汇报》的全体革命职工，从心底里感到，爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲；千言万语归成一句话：永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想！
    《文汇报》在新生后的三个多月中，取得了一些很好的经验，最根本最重要的一条是：要办好报纸，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充分发扬无产阶级革命精神，彻底革命，不断革命。
    把宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想作为报纸的最高战斗任务
    《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派，对毛主席、对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限忠诚。在新生后的第一张《文汇报》上，我们就向党、向人民立下了誓言：“毛泽东思想是我们办好新《文汇报》的灵魂。我们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想作为新《文汇报》的最高的战斗任务。”
    新《文汇报》针对实际斗争中的问题，及时按专题编选毛主席语录，使广大群众按照毛主席的教导，掌握政策，指导行动，使无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利发展。我们曾先后编选刊登毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”、“论夺权斗争”、“干部政策”、“要节约闹革命”、“整风”等专题语录。在革命形势发展的关键性时刻，还根据斗争的需要，重新刊登毛主席的有关著作。如当无产阶级革命派在大联合基础上进行夺权的时候，针对大联合中存在的问题，及时地刊登了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》这篇光辉著作。在上海夺权斗争取得决定性胜利，成立上海市革命委员会以后，刊登了毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》。在连续发表了《搞臭无政府主义》、《搞臭风头主义》、《搞臭小团体主义》等社论以后，为了刨掉个人主义，即“私”字这一毒根，重新刊登了毛主席的万古长青的著作“老三篇”。
    新《文汇报》，力求用毛泽东思想及时解决现实斗争中的问题。打倒反革命经济主义，彻底粉碎资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，这是关系到上海无产阶级文化大革命命运的一个大战役。新《文汇报》是作为前哨阵地投入战斗的。当时，上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派利用职权，刮起了一阵反革命经济主义的妖风。就在这一时刻，报社接到了上海工人革命造反总司令部等革命群众组织署名的《告上海全市人民书》的传单。传单要不要登？党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，能够刮起反革命经济主义妖风，就是因为有权。这张传单说的就是夺权斗争。应该登！这张传单终于在第一版的显要地位刊登出来了。报纸登传单，打破了《文汇报》多少年来的老框框。《告上海全市人民书》是全国又一张马列主义的大字报，一发表，就得到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的高度赞扬，并亲自决定在《人民日报》上转载，在电台向全国广播。
    为了彻底打倒反革命经济主义，《文汇报》在宣传上发动了一场“人民战争”。一月九日，发表了上海各革命群众组织联合署名的反对反革命经济主义的《紧急通告》。一月十日，又在第一版刊登毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的专题语录，并发表社论《打倒经济
  主义》。战斗越打越激烈了。在近一个月内，我们重炮猛轰反革命经济主义，用社论、述评、文章、报道等各种武器，狠狠打，连续打。反革命经济主义妖风刮到那里，就打到那里，从城市到农村，从工矿企业到财贸部门，穷追猛打，把反革命经济主义打得落花流水，如过街老鼠，无处藏身。
    我们深刻地体会到，报纸要宣传群众，指导运动，就一定要用毛泽东思想之“矢”，去射现实斗争之“的”。
    坚持正确的阶级立场，高举鲜明的战斗旗帜
    毛主席教导我们：“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明。我们共产党人从来认为隐瞒自己的观点是可耻的。我们党所办的报纸，我们党所进行的一切宣传工作，都应当是生动的，鲜明的，尖锐的，毫不吞吞吐吐。”新《文汇报》正是根据毛主席的这个指示来办报的。
    报纸是阶级斗争的重要战场。无产阶级革命派的报纸，就是要敢于为无产阶级革命派讲话，坚决一边倒，旗帜鲜明，尖锐泼辣，敢于捅阶级斗争的“马蜂窝”，不怕有人反对。
    过去有一种说法，报纸既要反映实际，又要和实际保持一段距离。这种新闻“理论”，长期以来束缚着报纸工作人员的手脚，许多报纸工作人员成了“好好先生”，报上的报道和文章也常是些磨平棱角、不痛不痒的东西。现在，这种谬论被扔进了垃圾箱，在报社大树无产阶级革命派敢想敢说、敢做敢为的战斗风格。
    为了把报纸办得旗帜鲜明，尖锐泼辣，新《文汇报》十分重视写好评论。要写好评论，自己必须坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，有鲜明的爱憎，与他们同生死，共患难，为他们说话。如果你是一个保守派，绝对写不出为革命派大长志气的评论，别人写了，也不敢登。一月六日发表的社论《革命造反有理万岁》，早在一九六六年十二月中旬就写好了，那时报社的无产阶级革命派责令报社前负责人刊登。这个负责人怕丢乌纱帽，不敢登。革命派在夺权后的第三天，就在一版头条地位刊登了这篇社论，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    评论是报纸投向阶级斗争的一把快刀。那里斗争最尖锐，就把这个武器砍向那里。在“一月革命”的风暴中，我们目睹了反革命经济主义的罪恶，义愤填膺，拿起这把快刀，狠狠地向这个敌人砍去。二十多天内，接连发表了九篇社论，从工业、农业、商业、知识青年上山下乡等方面，向反革命经济主义开刀。此外，还发表了配合各种报道、文章的四篇编者按，狠狠地打击了反革命经济主义。
    《红旗》杂志第五期评论员文章和戚本禹同志文章的发表，吹响了向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的进军号。新《文汇报》紧紧跟上这场大批判的新形势，接连发表了《彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫》、《口诛笔伐批〈修养〉》等多篇社论，刊登了广大工农兵和革命小将揭发、批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其《修养》的许多文章，掀起了群众性的大批判高潮，对中国的赫鲁晓夫展开了猛烈的进攻。
    通过大批判运动，上海市第六女中的革命红卫兵，实现了革命的大联合。我们认为，她们的经验十分重要，有普遍意义。在四月九日第一版上，以显著地位刊登了她们的经验，并当夜赶写了社论《再论在大批判中推进大联合》。市六女中的经验发表后，又一次得到了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的支持和赞扬。
    新《文汇报》的很多评论，不是关在房间里想出来的，而是在同对立思想的辩论中产生的。如《斗争里弄干部，大方向就是错了！》等社论，都是在同持相反观点的人激烈辩论后写出来的。辩论，是一种很好的社会调查，也是抓活思想的有效方法。经过辩论写出的评论，有对立面，有“火药味”，战斗性较强。
    为了加强评论的战斗性，必须紧跟毛主席、党中央的最新指示，密切注视现实斗争中的问题。一发现问题，就赶紧写。该今天见报的不拖到明天，该今天写的不拖到明天写。如二月七日社论《抓革命，促春耕》和二月十二日社论《农村革命干部“杀”上火线去》，都是在来稿中发现了重要文章，连夜赶写出来的。又如当时了解到，有些同志对干部起来革命很不理解，存在一些不正确的看法。二月十八日，我们赶写了社论《革命不分先后》，提出对愿意起来革命的干部要抱热忱欢迎的态度。今天革命，今天欢迎；明天革命，明天欢迎。
    坚决贯彻毛主席的群众办报路线
    毛主席说：“我们的报纸也要靠大家来办，靠全体人民群众来办，靠全党来办，而不能只靠少数人关起门来办。”
    旧《文汇报》在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的把持下，根本不可能执行群众办报路线，而是靠少数“专家”办报，关起门来办报。一些反动学术“权威”是旧《文汇报》的台柱子，他们大放其毒，把报纸搞得乌烟瘴气。资产阶级办报路线在报社内根深蒂固。
    《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派夺权后，立即狠抓革命，奋起大造资产阶级办报路线的反。我们认为，广大无产阶级革命派是新《文汇报》的坚强后盾。要办好报纸，必须走群众路线，依靠群众办报，开门办报。《文汇报》新生后不久，就邀请全市各革命群众组织的同志开会，具体商讨办好《文汇报》的措施。还通过召开座谈会、个别访问等多种形式，主动请广大无产阶级革命派反映情况，提供线索，出主意，想办法。每当革命派的同志提出好的建议，我们立即虚心接受。毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，就是接受了革命派同志的建议而刊登的。《搞臭风头主义》的社论，就是在与北京红卫兵交谈中得到启发，然后及时写出来的。《上海革命造反派向资产阶级反动路线发起总攻击》等反映上海文化革命形势的记者述评，都是在有关革命群众组织的帮助下写出来的。
    为了更好地传播无产阶级革命派的声音，新《文汇报》开辟了“革命造反派论坛”和“革命群众来信”等专栏。对一些重要的文章和来信，还配有社论或加编者按。
    通过实践，我们认识到，办报走不走群众路线，重视不重视群众工作，这不是一个小问题，而是一个大问题，是区别无产阶级办报路线和资产阶级办报路线的原则问题。
    在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化
    《文汇报》新生后，报社的无产阶级革命派提出了响亮的口号：“学习革命派，宣传革命派，争当革命派！”
    《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派，在斗争中努力活学活用毛主席著作。当斗争困难的时候，我们从“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”中吸取力量，坚持斗争，直到最后胜利。当取得一些成绩的时候，又把“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”作为座右铭，开展批评与自我批评，严格检查各方面的工作，那怕有一点骄傲自满的苗头，也不断改正。我们以“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》为武器，进行整风，横扫头脑里的“私”字，大立“公”字当头的无产阶级世界观。夺权以后，我们坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，争取和团结革命干部一道工作，实现革命的“三结合”。对犯了严重错误的干部，也不是一棍子打死，而是根据毛主席“惩前毖后、治病救人”的政策，采用边工作边改造的方法，帮助这些干部改正错误。我们深深体会到，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，一刻也不能离开；那个时候离开，那个时候就会迷失方向，走错道路。
    我们遵循毛主席“报纸工作人员为了教育群众，首先要向群众学习”的教导，深入斗争第一线，向广大无产阶级革命派学习。这是促进干部思想革命化，写出有质量的新闻报道的重要关键。那里斗争最紧张，就到那里去。记者下去采访，常常以战斗员的身份投入斗争，参加批判、斗争大会和辩论会。记者只有深入第一线，才能从斗争中发现新鲜事物，才能写出有质量的报道来。
    最近，《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派响应毛主席、党中央的号召，通过开门整风，牢记毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导，决心高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，克服工作中的缺点和错误，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
