Red diplomats Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren, who were unjustly expelled by the Indonesian reactionaries, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today. They strongly condemned the Indonesian reactionary government's brazen violation of international norms, brutal infringement of the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel, and mad anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities.

Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren pointed out in their speeches that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution is completely a lackey and accomplice of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are part of the international alliance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries against China. They said that the Chinese people firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people and the just struggle of the broad patriotic overseas Chinese. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian reactionaries to the Chinese people must be settled.

Attending the press conference were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen, Zhao Xiaoshou, a Chinese Embassy staff member in Jakarta who bravely protected the five-starred red flag and was shot and injured by Indonesian reactionaries, Shi Xinren, a deputy military attach√© who bravely resisted the Indonesian fascist thugs, was beaten and injured, and was unjustly expelled by the Indonesian reactionary government in January this year, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department Qin Jialin, and representatives of the revolutionary faction of the Foreign Ministry.

Yao Dengshan spoke first. He said that after returning to the capital of our motherland, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao received us. This reception is the greatest care and encouragement for all our diplomatic fighters and the broad patriotic overseas Chinese, and it is also the greatest encouragement and support for the Indonesian people and the revolutionary people of the world.

Yao Dengshan exposed and condemned the Indonesian reactionary government's bloody suppression of overseas Chinese and its infringement on the personal freedom of our diplomatic personnel. He said that he and Xu Ren were declared "unwelcome persons" by the Indonesian reactionary government. This arrogant and unreasonable measure is a serious step taken by them to further sabotage the relations between the two countries. On April 20, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Jakarta held a funeral procession for Ning Xiangyu, a leader of the Jakarta Overseas Chinese Association who was brutally killed by Indonesian military police, expressing their indignation and protest against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government. The Indonesian reactionary government actually dispatched military police and organized thugs to open fire on the unarmed overseas Chinese mourners, creating a large-scale bloody incident. After the incident, he immediately notified Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik by telephone, preparing to lodge the strongest and most serious protest against the above-mentioned bloody incident. However, Malik, guilty of the crime, dared not face him, and he was repeatedly intercepted by Indonesian armed military police and thugs on his way back and forth. On April 21, a large number of Indonesian military police and spies appeared around the Chinese Embassy. On April 22, the Indonesian reactionary government dispatched hundreds of military police and thugs to surround, blockade, and attack the Chinese Embassy. At the same time, the Indonesian military police and thugs began to conduct large-scale searches, looting, and destruction of overseas Chinese in Jakarta, and even massacred innocent overseas Chinese. On April 23, Consul General Xu Ren went to meet with the responsible officials of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry as scheduled to conduct negotiations. As soon as he stepped out of the embassy gate, the Indonesian military police aimed their guns at him and forcibly escorted him to the Jakarta Military District Command Headquarters, detaining him for eight hours. The Indonesian military police also boasted that they were acting on orders. The Indonesian reactionary government created the above-mentioned bloody suppression of overseas Chinese and brutal infringement on the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel, not only refusing to admit guilt, but also brazenly declaring on April 24 that he and Consul General Xu Ren were "unwelcome persons." The facts fully show that it is the Indonesian reactionary government that is unscrupulously sabotaging the relations between the two countries. They, however, turn around and accuse us of "deteriorating the relations between the two countries" and engaging in so-called "anti-Indonesian subversive activities." However, no lies can cover up their anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, and no excuses can shift their responsibility for sabotaging the relations between the two countries.

Yao Dengshan pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries have pushed the relations between Indonesia and China to the brink of rupture. This is entirely the result of the actions of the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution. After they came to power through a counter-revolutionary military coup backed by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, they launched a mad wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, creating a series of shocking anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents.

Yao Dengshan said that over the past year, the Indonesian reactionary government has trampled on the most basic norms of international relations and brutally infringed upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese diplomatic mission, as well as the personal safety and freedom of Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel. They mobilized fully armed military police and large numbers of thugs to attack the Chinese mission 38 times, seizing more than ten Chinese mission buildings. In the attacks, they wantonly destroyed property, tore up the Chinese national flag, smashed the Chinese national emblem, and beat up Chinese diplomatic personnel at will. Forty-plus Chinese diplomatic, consular personnel, and journalists were injured by gunshots and beatings. When they attacked the Chinese Embassy on April 15 last year, they actually mobilized armored vehicles to ram open the gate and fired at our diplomatic personnel, injuring staff member Zhao Xiaoshou on the spot. The above-mentioned heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionary government show that it is a savage and reactionary government; it is a reactionary government that brutally violates the norms of international relations.

Yao Dengshan said that the Indonesian reactionary government is madly implementing a racist anti-Chinese policy, inflicting inhuman persecution on hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations. They mobilized military police and organized thugs to burn, loot, arrest, and kill overseas Chinese. They herded tens of thousands of overseas Chinese into concentration camps and subjected them to all kinds of torture. They also issued various anti-Chinese decrees, banning overseas Chinese from doing business in some areas, seizing overseas Chinese shops, forcing overseas Chinese to pay exorbitant "head taxes," and even banning overseas Chinese from using the language and script of their motherland. They openly colluded with the Kuomintang bandits, attempting to split the unity of overseas Chinese, incite overseas Chinese against their motherland, and sabotage the friendship between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people. The savage racist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government are no different from the atrocities of Hitler's fascism and U.S. imperialism.

Yao Dengshan pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are part of the international alliance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries against China. The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our greatest leader Chairman Mao has shaken the world and dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. They are terrified and hateful. They are even more madly opposed to China and have launched a new wave of anti-China countercurrent. The Indonesian reactionaries, in order to curry favor with their masters and receive rewards, have worked even harder to serve as anti-China henchmen. In order to support the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people policies, U.S. imperialism has provided the Indonesian reactionaries with large quantities of weapons and hundreds of millions of dollars in "loans" over the past year. The Soviet revisionists, who are dressed in the cloak of a socialist country, have also openly provided various kinds of aid to the reactionaries who have blood on their hands, and even continued to provide weapons, promising to provide new loans. U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have also directly encouraged the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. The Indonesian thugs who attacked the Chinese embassy received funding and various material aid from the U.S. embassy.

He said that the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are also inseparable from its domestic policy of anti-communism and anti-people. The Indonesian reactionaries have carried out bloody suppression against the people at home, massacring tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Indonesian people, and throwing tens of thousands of revolutionary people into prisons.

Yao Dengshan emphasized that, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. The more they kill, the more the revolutionary forces grow, and the closer they come to their own doom. This is an irresistible law." The Indonesian people, through repeated and sharp class struggles, have come to deeply understand that only by following the path of Mao Zedong can they save Indonesia from national disaster and achieve their own liberation. Under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, the flames of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle are burning up. Therefore, the Indonesian reactionaries are terrified of the great Mao Zedong Thought and hate the Chinese people who have consistently supported the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle to the bone. They launched a wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in an attempt to resist the influence of Mao Zedong Thought and extinguish the flames of the Indonesian revolution.

Yao Dengshan said that the Chinese diplomatic personnel in Indonesia and the broad overseas Chinese have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. They have shown great revolutionary heroism in their struggle against the enemy, embodying the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This fully demonstrates that our diplomatic fighters, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless, and it embodies their noble qualities of loyalty to the proletarian revolution, loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to the socialist motherland. They are indeed the diplomatic representatives of our 700 million compatriots and the good fighters of Chairman Mao.

Yao Dengshan said that the broad overseas Chinese, in the face of the racist anti-Chinese wave launched by the Indonesian reactionary government, remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "all reactionaries are paper tigers" and followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "if they don't offend us, we don't offend them; if they offend us, we must offend them," launching a heroic struggle against oppression and deprivation. Under the savage attacks of the Indonesian armed military police and thugs, they fearlessly fought back. In many places, overseas Chinese held demonstrations and parades to protest the massacre of innocent overseas Chinese by the Indonesian reactionaries. In the face of the Indonesian military police's gunfire, they loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations and sang revolutionary songs, bravely advancing. The overseas Chinese's struggle against oppression and deprivation has won the sympathy of the broad Indonesian people.

Yao Dengshan said that the overseas Chinese's struggle against oppression is entirely a just action. They have a powerful motherland as their backing and 700 million compatriots as their strong support. No matter what vicious and treacherous means the Indonesian reactionaries adopt, they cannot suppress their just struggle.

Yao Dengshan said that the heroic struggle of our diplomatic personnel and the broad overseas Chinese not only safeguarded the dignity of the motherland and the legitimate rights and interests of the overseas Chinese but also greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, inspiring the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.

Yao Dengshan said that our diplomatic personnel and the broad overseas Chinese have achieved one victory after another in their heroic struggle. What gave them such great strength? It is Chairman Mao, it is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, taking Chairman Mao's words as the guide for all their actions. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful and invincible weapon, they had the fearless revolutionary spirit to despise the enemy; they had a firm and correct political direction; they had a strong will to struggle; they dared to struggle and were good at struggling; they could, in any sharp and complex situation, "make up their minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Yao Dengshan finally said that the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples is unbreakable by any force. The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. We believe that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian people will definitely fight bravely and push the Indonesian revolution to new heights, achieving the final victory. We believe that the dark clouds currently hanging over the relations between the two countries are temporary. As Chairman Mao taught us: "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone."

Later, Yao Dengshan answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists. He said that at present, the Indonesian people are fighting with great confidence in the face of the treacherous environment. The Indonesian people love the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, more than anyone else. They overcome all difficulties and find every possible way to study Chairman Mao's works, arming themselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought to strive for victory in the struggle.

When talking about the collusion between U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries, Yao Dengshan cited facts to point out that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are the culprits behind the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime's suppression of the Indonesian people's revolution. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has always been hostile to the Indonesian Communist Party, trying to destroy it. When the Indonesian fascist military clique was massacring Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people, the Soviet revisionists applauded, calling the executioner Nasution a "national hero against imperialism," and calling the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship a "anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist" regime. A series of facts show that the Soviet revisionists are actively supporting the Indonesian reactionaries. The Indonesian reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, will have no good end.

Xu Ren, in answering the journalists' questions, introduced the great encouragement of the great proletarian cultural revolution and the Red Guard movement to the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia. He said that as long as the Indonesian reactionaries persecute overseas Chinese for one day, the patriotic overseas Chinese's struggle will not stop for one day. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, with the support of the people of the motherland, the revolutionary people of Indonesia, and the progressive people of the world, and inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the great proletarian cultural revolution and the Red Guards, their just struggle against persecution will definitely achieve the final victory. The speeches of Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren at the press conference aroused a wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.
