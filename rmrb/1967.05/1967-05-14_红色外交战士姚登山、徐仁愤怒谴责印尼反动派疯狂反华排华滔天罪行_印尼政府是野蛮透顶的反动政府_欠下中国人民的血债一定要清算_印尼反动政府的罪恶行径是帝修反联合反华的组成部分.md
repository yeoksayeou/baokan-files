Red diplomats Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren, who were unjustly expelled by the Indonesian reactionaries, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing today. They strongly condemned the Indonesian reactionary government's brazen violation of international norms, brutal infringement of the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel, and mad anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities.

Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren pointed out in their speeches that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution is completely a lackey and accomplice of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are part of the international alliance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries against China. They said that the Chinese people firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people and the just struggle of the broad patriotic overseas Chinese. The blood debt owed by the Indonesian reactionaries to the Chinese people must be settled.

Attending the press conference were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen, Zhao Xiaoshou, a Chinese Embassy staff member in Jakarta who bravely protected the five-starred red flag and was shot and injured by Indonesian reactionaries, Shi Xinren, a deputy military attaché who bravely resisted the Indonesian fascist thugs, was beaten and injured, and was unjustly expelled by the Indonesian reactionary government in January this year, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department Qin Jialin, and representatives of the revolutionary faction of the Foreign Ministry.

Yao Dengshan spoke first. He said that after returning to the capital of our motherland, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao received us. This reception is the greatest care and encouragement for all our diplomatic fighters and the broad patriotic overseas Chinese, and it is also the greatest encouragement and support for the Indonesian people and the revolutionary people of the world.

Yao Dengshan exposed and condemned the Indonesian reactionary government's bloody suppression of overseas Chinese and its infringement on the personal freedom of our diplomatic personnel. He said that he and Xu Ren were declared "unwelcome persons" by the Indonesian reactionary government. This arrogant and unreasonable measure is a serious step taken by them to further sabotage the relations between the two countries. On April 20, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Jakarta held a funeral procession for Ning Xiangyu, a leader of the Jakarta Overseas Chinese Association who was brutally killed by Indonesian military police, expressing their indignation and protest against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government. The Indonesian reactionary government actually dispatched military police and organized thugs to open fire on the unarmed overseas Chinese mourners, creating a large-scale bloody incident. After the incident, he immediately notified Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik by telephone, preparing to lodge the strongest and most serious protest against the above-mentioned bloody incident. However, Malik, guilty of the crime, dared not face him, and he was repeatedly intercepted by Indonesian armed military police and thugs on his way back and forth. On April 21, a large number of Indonesian military police and spies appeared around the Chinese Embassy. On April 22, the Indonesian reactionary government dispatched hundreds of military police and thugs to surround, blockade, and attack the Chinese Embassy. At the same time, the Indonesian military police and thugs began to conduct large-scale searches, looting, and destruction of overseas Chinese in Jakarta, and even massacred innocent overseas Chinese. On April 23, Consul General Xu Ren went to meet with the responsible officials of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry as scheduled to conduct negotiations. As soon as he stepped out of the embassy gate, the Indonesian military police aimed their guns at him and forcibly escorted him to the Jakarta Military District Command Headquarters, detaining him for eight hours. The Indonesian military police also boasted that they were acting on orders. The Indonesian reactionary government created the above-mentioned bloody suppression of overseas Chinese and brutal infringement on the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel, not only refusing to admit guilt, but also brazenly declaring on April 24 that he and Consul General Xu Ren were "unwelcome persons." The facts fully show that it is the Indonesian reactionary government that is unscrupulously sabotaging the relations between the two countries. They, however, turn around and accuse us of "deteriorating the relations between the two countries" and engaging in so-called "anti-Indonesian subversive activities." However, no lies can cover up their anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, and no excuses can shift their responsibility for sabotaging the relations between the two countries.

Yao Dengshan pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries have pushed the relations between Indonesia and China to the brink of rupture. This is entirely the result of the actions of the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution. After they came to power through a counter-revolutionary military coup backed by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, they launched a mad wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, creating a series of shocking anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents.

Yao Dengshan said that over the past year, the Indonesian reactionary government has trampled on the most basic norms of international relations and brutally infringed upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese diplomatic mission, as well as the personal safety and freedom of Chinese diplomatic and consular personnel. They mobilized fully armed military police and large numbers of thugs to attack the Chinese mission 38 times, seizing more than ten Chinese mission buildings. In the attacks, they wantonly destroyed property, tore up the Chinese national flag, smashed the Chinese national emblem, and beat up Chinese diplomatic personnel at will. Forty-plus Chinese diplomatic, consular personnel, and journalists were injured by gunshots and beatings. When they attacked the Chinese Embassy on April 15 last year, they actually mobilized armored vehicles to ram open the gate and fired at our diplomatic personnel, injuring staff member Zhao Xiaoshou on the spot. The above-mentioned heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionary government show that it is a savage and reactionary government; it is a reactionary government that brutally violates the norms of international relations.

Yao Dengshan said that the Indonesian reactionary government is madly implementing a racist anti-Chinese policy, inflicting inhuman persecution on hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations. They mobilized military police and organized thugs to burn, loot, arrest, and kill overseas Chinese. They herded tens of thousands of overseas Chinese into concentration camps and subjected them to all kinds of torture. They also issued various anti-Chinese decrees, banning overseas Chinese from doing business in some areas, seizing overseas Chinese shops, forcing overseas Chinese to pay exorbitant "head taxes," and even banning overseas Chinese from using the language and script of their motherland. They openly colluded with the Kuomintang bandits, attempting to split the unity of overseas Chinese, incite overseas Chinese against their motherland, and sabotage the friendship between overseas Chinese and the Indonesian people. The savage racist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government are no different from the atrocities of Hitler's fascism and U.S. imperialism.

Yao Dengshan pointed out that the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are part of the international alliance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries against China. The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our greatest leader Chairman Mao has shaken the world and dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. They are terrified and hateful. They are even more madly opposed to China and have launched a new wave of anti-China countercurrent. The Indonesian reactionaries, in order to curry favor with their masters and receive rewards, have worked even harder to serve as anti-China henchmen. In order to support the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people policies, U.S. imperialism has provided the Indonesian reactionaries with large quantities of weapons and hundreds of millions of dollars in "loans" over the past year. The Soviet revisionists, who are dressed in the cloak of a socialist country, have also openly provided various kinds of aid to the reactionaries who have blood on their hands, and even continued to provide weapons, promising to provide new loans. U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism have also directly encouraged the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. The Indonesian thugs who attacked the Chinese embassy received funding and various material aid from the U.S. embassy.

He said that the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are also inseparable from its domestic policy of anti-communism and anti-people. The Indonesian reactionaries have carried out bloody suppression against the people at home, massacring tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Indonesian people, and throwing tens of thousands of revolutionary people into prisons.

Yao Dengshan emphasized that, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. The more they kill, the more the revolutionary forces grow, and the closer they come to their own doom. This is an irresistible law." The Indonesian people, through repeated and sharp class struggles, have come to deeply understand that only by following the path of Mao Zedong can they save Indonesia from national disaster and achieve their own liberation. Under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, the flames of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle are burning up. Therefore, the Indonesian reactionaries are terrified of the great Mao Zedong Thought and hate the Chinese people who have consistently supported the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle to the bone. They launched a wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities in an attempt to resist the influence of Mao Zedong Thought and extinguish the flames of the Indonesian revolution.

Yao Dengshan said that the Chinese diplomatic personnel in Indonesia and the broad overseas Chinese have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and waged a heroic and unyielding struggle against the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. They have shown great revolutionary heroism in their struggle against the enemy, embodying the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. This fully demonstrates that our diplomatic fighters, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are fearless, and it embodies their noble qualities of loyalty to the proletarian revolution, loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to the socialist motherland. They are indeed the diplomatic representatives of our 700 million compatriots and the good fighters of Chairman Mao.

Yao Dengshan said that the broad overseas Chinese, in the face of the racist anti-Chinese wave launched by the Indonesian reactionary government, remembered Chairman Mao's teachings on "all reactionaries are paper tigers" and followed Chairman Mao's instructions on "if they don't offend us, we don't offend them; if they offend us, we must offend them," launching a heroic struggle against oppression and deprivation. Under the savage attacks of the Indonesian armed military police and thugs, they fearlessly fought back. In many places, overseas Chinese held demonstrations and parades to protest the massacre of innocent overseas Chinese by the Indonesian reactionaries. In the face of the Indonesian military police's gunfire, they loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations and sang revolutionary songs, bravely advancing. The overseas Chinese's struggle against oppression and deprivation has won the sympathy of the broad Indonesian people.

Yao Dengshan said that the overseas Chinese's struggle against oppression is entirely a just action. They have a powerful motherland as their backing and 700 million compatriots as their strong support. No matter what vicious and treacherous means the Indonesian reactionaries adopt, they cannot suppress their just struggle.

Yao Dengshan said that the heroic struggle of our diplomatic personnel and the broad overseas Chinese not only safeguarded the dignity of the motherland and the legitimate rights and interests of the overseas Chinese but also greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people of the world, inspiring the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.

Yao Dengshan said that our diplomatic personnel and the broad overseas Chinese have achieved one victory after another in their heroic struggle. What gave them such great strength? It is Chairman Mao, it is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle, they studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, taking Chairman Mao's words as the guide for all their actions. Armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful and invincible weapon, they had the fearless revolutionary spirit to despise the enemy; they had a firm and correct political direction; they had a strong will to struggle; they dared to struggle and were good at struggling; they could, in any sharp and complex situation, "make up their minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

Yao Dengshan finally said that the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples is unbreakable by any force. The Chinese people will, as always, firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. We believe that under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the Indonesian people will definitely fight bravely and push the Indonesian revolution to new heights, achieving the final victory. We believe that the dark clouds currently hanging over the relations between the two countries are temporary. As Chairman Mao taught us: "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone."

Later, Yao Dengshan answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists. He said that at present, the Indonesian people are fighting with great confidence in the face of the treacherous environment. The Indonesian people love the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, more than anyone else. They overcome all difficulties and find every possible way to study Chairman Mao's works, arming themselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought to strive for victory in the struggle.

When talking about the collusion between U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries, Yao Dengshan cited facts to point out that U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are the culprits behind the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime's suppression of the Indonesian people's revolution. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has always been hostile to the Indonesian Communist Party, trying to destroy it. When the Indonesian fascist military clique was massacring Indonesian Communist Party members and revolutionary people, the Soviet revisionists applauded, calling the executioner Nasution a "national hero against imperialism," and calling the Indonesian fascist military dictatorship a "anti-imperialist, anti-colonialist" regime. A series of facts show that the Soviet revisionists are actively supporting the Indonesian reactionaries. The Indonesian reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, will have no good end.

Xu Ren, in answering the journalists' questions, introduced the great encouragement of the great proletarian cultural revolution and the Red Guard movement to the patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia. He said that as long as the Indonesian reactionaries persecute overseas Chinese for one day, the patriotic overseas Chinese's struggle will not stop for one day. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, with the support of the people of the motherland, the revolutionary people of Indonesia, and the progressive people of the world, and inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the great proletarian cultural revolution and the Red Guards, their just struggle against persecution will definitely achieve the final victory. The speeches of Yao Dengshan and Xu Ren at the press conference aroused a wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

    红色外交战士姚登山、徐仁愤怒谴责印尼反动派疯狂反华排华滔天罪行
    印尼政府是野蛮透顶的反动政府
    欠下中国人民的血债一定要清算
    印尼反动政府的罪恶行径是帝修反联合反华的组成部分
    据新华社十三日讯  毛主席的红色外交战士、被印尼反动派无理驱逐的中国驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和驻雅加达总领事徐仁，今天在北京举行中外记者招待会，强烈谴责印尼反动政府肆无忌惮地破坏国际关系准则，粗暴侵犯中国外交人员的人身自由，疯狂进行反华、排华的滔天罪行。姚登山和徐仁在讲话中指出：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的右派军人集团，完全是美帝、苏修的走狗和帮凶，印尼反动政府反华排华是国际上帝、修、反联合反华的一个组成部分。他们说，中国人民坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争和广大爱国华侨的正义斗争，印尼反动派欠下中国人民的血债是一定要清算的。
    出席中外记者招待会的，有外交部副部长韩念龙，在雅加达英勇保护五星国旗、被印尼反动派枪击光荣负伤的我国驻印尼大使馆工作人员赵小寿，曾经英勇抗击印尼法西斯暴徒、被打受伤、在今年一月被印尼反动政府无理驱逐的我国驻印尼大使馆副武官时心仁，外交部新闻司司长秦加林和外交部无产阶级革命派代表等。
    姚登山首先讲话。他说，我们回到祖国的首都以后，我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志接见了我们。这次接见是对我们全体外交战士和广大的爱国侨胞的最大关怀和最大鼓舞，也是对印尼人民和世界革命人民的最大鼓舞和最大支持。
    印尼反动政府破坏两国关系罪责难逃
    姚登山揭露和谴责了印尼反动政府血腥镇压华侨，以及侵犯我外交人员人身自由的暴行。他说，我和徐仁同志是被印尼反动政府宣布为所谓“不受欢迎的人”。印尼反动政府这一蛮横无理的措施，是他们最近加紧破坏两国关系的严重步骤。四月二十日，雅加达数万华侨为惨遭印尼军警杀害的雅加达侨团负责人宁祥雨老人送葬，表示他们对印尼反动政府法西斯暴行的愤慨和抗议。印尼反动政府竟然出动军警和组织暴徒，开枪射击手无寸铁的送葬华侨，制造了大规模的流血事件。事件发生后，我就电话通知印尼外交部长马利克，准备就上述流血事件向他提出最严重最强烈抗议，但是，马利克作贼心虚，不敢照面，我在往返途中，竟然一再遭到印尼武装军警和暴徒的无礼拦截。四月二十一日，中国大使馆周围，就出现了大批印尼军警和特务。四月二十二日，印尼反动政府派遣数百名军警和暴徒，包围、封锁和袭击中国大使馆。与此同时，印尼军警和暴徒开始对雅加达华侨进行大搜捕、大抢劫、大破坏，甚至屠杀无辜华侨。四月二十三日，徐仁总领事按约定时间前往会见印尼外交部负责官员，进行交涉。他一出大使馆门口，印尼军警就把枪口对准他，强行把他押送到雅加达军支区司令部，扣押达八小时之久。印尼军警还扬言他们是奉命行事的。印尼反动政府制造了上述血腥镇压华侨和粗暴侵犯中国外交人员的人身自由的暴行，不但不低头认罪，反而在四月二十四日悍然宣布我和徐仁总领事为“不受欢迎的人”。事实充分说明，是印尼反动政府不择手段地破坏两国关系，他们却反咬一口，竟然诬蔑我们“恶化两国关系”，进行所谓“反印尼颠覆活动”。但是，任何谎言都掩盖不了他们反华排华的罪行，任何借口都推脱不了他们破坏两国关系的罪责。
    姚登山指出，目前，印尼反动派已经把印尼和中国的关系推向破裂的边缘。这完全是以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派军人集团一手造成的。他们在美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义扶植下发动反革命军事政变上台后，就疯狂掀起了反华排华浪潮，制造了一系列骇人听闻的反华排华事件。
    姚登山说，一年多以来，印尼反动政府践踏最起码的国际关系准则，粗暴地侵犯中国外交代表机构的外交特权，侵犯中国外交和领事人员的人身安全和自由。他们调动全副武装的军警和大批暴徒，袭击中国代表机构达三十八次之多，霸占中国代表机构的房屋共十多处。他们在袭击中，大肆破坏，撕毁中国的国旗，砸烂中国的国徽，恣意殴打中国外交人员，被枪伤、打伤的有四十多名中国外交、领事人员和记者。他们在去年四月十五日袭击中国大使馆时，居然出动了装甲车撞开大门，开枪扫射我外交人员，当场枪伤工作人员赵小寿同志。印尼反动政府的上述累累罪行说明，它是野蛮透顶的反动政府；它是残暴破坏国际关系准则的反动政府。
    姚登山说，印尼反动政府疯狂推行种族主义排华政策，对世代居住在印尼的成百万华侨进行惨无人道的迫害。他们调动军警，组织暴徒，对华侨大烧、大抢、大捕、大杀。他们把成千上万的华侨，赶进集中营，百般虐待。他们还颁布各种排华法令，在某些地区禁止华侨经商，霸占华侨的商店，强迫华侨缴纳高额的“人头税”，甚至禁止华侨使用祖国的语言文字。他们公然勾结蒋介石匪帮，妄图分化华侨的团结，挑拨华侨同祖国的关系，破坏华侨和印尼人民的友谊。印尼反动政府这种野蛮的种族主义暴行，与希特勒法西斯和美帝国主义的暴行没有什么不同。
    美帝苏修竭力鼓励印尼反动派反华排华
    姚登山指出，印尼反动政府反华排华是国际上帝、修、反联合反华的一个组成部分。我们最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，震动了全世界，沉重地打击了美帝、苏修和各国反动派。他们怕得要死，恨得要命。他们更加疯狂地反对中国，掀起了一股新的反华逆流。印尼反动派，为了讨好他们的主子，领取犒赏，越加卖力地充当了反华的打手。为了支持印尼反动政府反华、反共、反人民，一年多以来，美帝给印尼反动派提供了大量武器和数亿美元的“贷款”。披着社会主义国家外衣的苏修，也公然向双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的反动派提供了各种各样的援助，甚至继续提供武器，并且答应给予新的贷款。美帝和苏修还直接鼓励印尼反动派的反华、排华活动。袭击中国使领馆的印尼暴徒，就是从美国大使馆得到经费和各种物资援助的。
    他说，印尼反动政府反华、排华，也是同它在国内推行反共、反人民的政策分不开的。印尼反动派对国内人民实行血腥镇压，屠杀了数十万印尼人民的优秀儿女，把数十万革命人民投入监狱。
    用毛泽东思想武装的中华儿女无所畏惧
    姚登山强调说，正如毛主席所指出的：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”印尼人民在反复尖锐的阶级斗争中，越来越深刻地体会到：只有走毛泽东的道路，才能挽救印尼的民族灾难，求得自己的解放。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，印尼人民革命斗争的烈火，正在燃烧起来。因此，印尼反动派对伟大的毛泽东思想怕得要死，对一贯支持印尼人民革命斗争的中国人民恨之入骨。他们掀起反华排华浪潮，妄图抵制毛泽东思想的影响，扑灭印尼革命的烈火。
    姚登山说，中国驻印尼的外交人员和广大华侨，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同印尼反动政府的反华排华活动进行了英勇和坚强的斗争。他们在对敌斗争中表现了大无畏的革命英雄主义，发扬了无产阶级的革命气节。这充分体现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国外交战士是无所畏惧的，体现了他们忠于无产阶级革命、忠于伟大的毛泽东思想、忠于社会主义祖国的高贵品质。他们不愧为我们七亿祖国人民的外交代表，不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    姚登山说，广大华侨在印尼反动政府掀起的种族主义排华浪潮中，牢记毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的教导，遵循了毛主席“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人”的指示，展开了英勇的反迫害、反剥夺的正义斗争。他们在印尼武装军警和暴徒的野蛮进攻下，奋不顾身，进行自卫。许多地方的华侨，为了抗议印尼反动派对无辜华侨的屠杀，举行游行示威，他们在印尼军警的枪林弹雨中，高声朗读毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲，奋勇前进。华侨反迫害、反剥夺的斗争，得到了广大印尼人民的同情。
    姚登山说，印尼华侨的反迫害斗争完全是正义的行动，他们有强大的祖国作为靠山，有七亿同胞作为自己的坚强后盾。印尼反动派无论采取什么阴险毒辣手段，都压服不了他们的正义斗争。
    姚登山说，我们外交人员和广大华侨的英勇斗争，不仅维护了祖国的尊严，维护了华侨的正当权益，而且大大灭了帝国主义、现代修正主义和印尼反动派的威风，大大长了世界革命人民的志气，鼓舞了印尼人民的革命斗争。
    姚登山说，我们的外交人员和广大华侨的英勇斗争取得了一个又一个的胜利。是什么给了他们这样巨大的力量？是毛主席，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的话当作一切行动的指南。掌握了毛泽东思想这一威力无比的强大武器，他们就有了大无畏的革命精神，敢于藐视敌人；他们就有了坚定正确的政治方向；他们就有了坚强的斗争意志；他们就敢于斗争，善于斗争；他们就能够在任何尖锐复杂的情况下，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    任何力量破坏不了两国人民战斗友谊
    姚登山最后说，中国和印尼人民之间的战斗友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。中国人民将一如既往，坚定不移地支持印尼人民的革命斗争。我们相信，印尼人民在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，一定会前赴后继，英勇战斗，把印尼革命推向新的高潮，取得最后的胜利。我们相信，目前笼罩在两国关系上的乌云是暂时的。正如毛主席教导我们的：“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。”
    随后，姚登山回答了中外记者提出的问题。他说，当前印尼人民在险恶的环境中，正满怀信心地进行着斗争。印尼人民无限热爱全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，他们排除万难，想尽办法学习毛主席著作，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己，去争取斗争的胜利。
    谈到美帝、苏修和印尼反动派的勾结时，姚登山列举事实，指出美帝和苏修是操纵苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权镇压印尼人民革命的罪魁祸首。他指出，苏修领导集团一贯仇视印尼共产党，企图把印尼共产党整垮。当印尼法西斯军人集团大肆屠杀印尼共产党员和印尼革命人民时，苏修拍手叫好，称刽子手纳苏蒂安为“反帝的民族英雄”，称印尼法西斯军事独裁政权为“反帝反殖”的政权，一系列事实说明，苏修是积极支持印尼反动派的。印尼反动派勾结美帝、苏修，是决没有好下场的。
    徐仁同志在回答记者的提问中，介绍了我国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动对印尼爱国侨胞的巨大鼓舞。他说，只要印尼反动派迫害华侨一天，爱国华侨的斗争就一天不会停止。爱国华侨在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，在祖国人民、印尼革命人民和世界进步人民的支持下，在无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵的革命造反精神鼓舞下，他们反迫害的正义斗争一定会取得最后的胜利。姚登山和徐仁在招待会上的讲话，在全场激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
