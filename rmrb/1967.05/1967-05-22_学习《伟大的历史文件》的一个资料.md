The editorial board of the *Red Flag* magazine and the editorial board of the *People's Daily* published an article titled "The Great Historical Document," which states: "Lenin saw that after the proletariat seized power, the defeated bourgeoisie, even more powerful than the proletariat, constantly attempted to restore their rule. Simultaneously, small producers continually gave rise to new capitalism and bourgeoisie, threatening proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, to deal with these counter-revolutionary threats and overcome them, it is necessary to strengthen proletarian dictatorship over a long period. There is no other way. However, because Lenin died too early, he did not have the chance to solve these problems in practice. Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist. He solved a large number of counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the party, such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, Bukharin, and Rykov. His flaw was that he did not acknowledge, in theory, the existence of classes and class struggle in society during the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship. The revolution's outcome had not been finally decided, and if things went wrong, the bourgeoisie could stage a comeback. In the year before his death, he had already realized this, saying that socialist society has contradictions, and if things go wrong, these contradictions could become antagonistic."

This is a very important and scientific judgment. To help readers understand these scientific judgments, several comrades have compiled a brief resource. We publish it here for the readers' reference.

Lenin had repeatedly discussed many theoretical and practical issues related to proletarian dictatorship. Some of his important thoughts on this subject are reflected in his famous works such as "The State and Revolution," "Economic and Political Problems of the Proletarian Dictatorship," "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," and "In Honor of the Hungarian Workers."

After the proletariat seized power, does class struggle still exist over a long period? Lenin answered this question affirmatively. He said: "The elimination of classes requires a long, arduous, and tenacious class struggle. After the overthrow of the bourgeois state power, after the destruction of the bourgeois state, after the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship, class struggle does not disappear (as the old socialists and old social democrats imagined), but only changes its form, becoming more brutal in many respects." ("In Honor of the Hungarian Workers," *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 29, Page 352.)

Lenin also said: "The transition from capitalism to communism is an entire historical epoch. As long as this epoch has not ended, the exploiters will inevitably harbor hopes of restoration and turn these hopes into restoration actions." ("Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky," *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 28, Page 235.)

Lenin analyzed the situation and changes in the relationships between various classes under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. He emphasized that the overthrown bourgeoisie still had the conditions and strength to resist over a long period, even more powerful than the proletariat. The exploiting classes were unwilling to accept their defeat. They constantly attempted to achieve counter-revolutionary restoration.

Lenin said: "Under the proletarian dictatorship, the exploiting classes, i.e., the landlord and capitalist classes, have not yet disappeared and cannot disappear all at once. The exploiters have been defeated but not yet eliminated. They still have an international base, i.e., international capital, because they are a branch of international capital. They still have part of the means of production, money, and extensive social connections. Their resistance is strengthened a thousandfold by their defeat. The 'art' of managing the state, military, and economy gives them an enormous advantage, so their role is incomparably greater than their proportion in the total population. The class struggle of the overthrown exploiters against the vanguard of the exploited (i.e., the proletariat) has become incredibly brutal." ("Economic and Political Problems of the Proletarian Dictatorship," *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 30, Page 95.)

Regarding small production and small producers, Lenin also provided a scientific analysis. He repeatedly pointed out that one of the reasons for the strength of the bourgeoisie lies in the existence of the habitual force of small production. Lenin said: "The resistance of the bourgeoisie, because of its overthrow (even in one country), becomes ten times more ferocious. Its strength lies not only in the power of international capital, not only in its various international connections being firm and powerful, but also in the force of habit, the force of small production. Because, unfortunately, there is still a lot of small production in the world, and small production constantly, daily, spontaneously, and in large quantities, produces capitalism and the bourgeoisie. For all these reasons, proletarian dictatorship is necessary." ("Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 31, Page 6.) Lenin also said: "It is a thousand times easier to 'defeat' hundreds of thousands of small proprietors than to defeat a powerful and centralized bourgeoisie. And these small proprietors, with their daily, petty, invisible, and intangible corrupting activities, create the evil consequences that the bourgeoisie needs to restore its rule." ("Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 31, Page 26.)

From these aspects, Lenin emphasized the sharpness and complexity of class struggle after the proletariat seized power and proposed that the only way to overcome the danger of bourgeois restoration is to strengthen proletarian dictatorship.

Lenin said: "The development towards communism must go through proletarian dictatorship and cannot take any other path, because there is no one else and no other path that can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalists." ("The State and Revolution," *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 25, Page 448.)

In summary, Lenin saw that after the proletariat seized power, the defeated bourgeoisie, even more powerful than the proletariat, constantly attempted to restore their rule. Simultaneously, small producers continually gave rise to new capitalism and bourgeoisie, threatening proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, to deal with these counter-revolutionary threats and overcome them, it is necessary to strengthen proletarian dictatorship over a long period. There is no other way. However, Lenin died in 1924 and did not have the chance to solve these problems in practice.

After Lenin's death, Stalin inherited Lenin's great cause and led the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people to defend and consolidate proletarian dictatorship, achieving the great successes of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization.

Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist. He solved a large number of counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the party, such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, Bukharin, and Rykov.

Trotsky and other counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the party were enemies of Leninism. They sabotaged the Leninist line on a series of major issues in the revolution, attempting to strangle the socialist revolution.

Trotsky opposed Lenin and Stalin's theory that socialism could achieve victory in one country, proposing the reactionary "permanent revolution" theory, claiming that it is impossible to break free from "material dependence on the world economy" within the scope of a nation-state and to build socialism independently.

Trotsky opposed proletarian dictatorship, claiming that proletarian dictatorship would inevitably lead to "hostile conflicts" with the vast majority of the peasantry, slandering and attacking Stalin for developing the state apparatus into an "unprecedented coercive tool" and "strangling the people's independence."

Trotsky also concentrated on attacking the leading force of proletarian dictatorship—the Communist Party. After Lenin's death, Trotsky, under the pretext of "restoring party democracy," "opposing bureaucracy," and "establishing collective leadership," opposed the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee led by Stalin. He attempted to turn the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) into a bourgeois party, i.e., a revisionist party that restores capitalism.

Trotsky also fiercely attacked socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, attempting to restore capitalism. He shouted that the Soviet Union lacked developed industry, and implementing agricultural collectivization was a "blind, brutal, and adventurous method"; he proposed the so-called "super-industrial plan," attempting to increase taxes on peasants, destroy the worker-peasant alliance, disrupt the economic integration of cities and countryside, and undermine the foundation of industry.

Zinoviev and Kamenev also shouted that the Soviet Union was technologically and economically backward and could not achieve victory in socialism. In the summer of 1926, Zinoviev and Trotsky formed an anti-party alliance, agreeing with Trotsky on a series of major issues.

Stalin wrote a series of works, including "The Foundations of Leninism," "Some Questions of Leninism," and "Questions and Answers," sharply criticizing Trotsky's opportunist fallacies and defending Leninism. He pointed out: "Not believing in the possibility of building socialism in our country will lead to liquidationism and degeneration." ("Questions and Answers," *Collected Works of Stalin*, Volume 7, Page 139.) Stalin believed that the Soviet government, relying on a strong worker-peasant alliance and with the support of the international proletariat and the peoples of colonial and semi-colonial countries, could achieve victory in socialism in one country. Stalin pointed out: The essence of Trotsky's fallacies is "to clear the way for the establishment of a bourgeois democratic republic." ("Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to the Sixteenth Congress," *Collected Works of Stalin*, Volume 12, Page 308.) Stalin exposed Trotsky's fallacies, such as "restoring party democracy," as attempts to disintegrate the party, undermine party unity, and break the party's backbone. Stalin pointed out: The Trotskyites "are industrialization advocates in words but industrialization's enemies in deeds." ("On the Anti-Party Alliance in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," *Collected Works of Stalin*, Volume 8, Page 202.)

Radek, Bukharin, and Rykov openly defended the interests of the kulaks, proposing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," claiming that the greater the victory of socialism, the milder the class struggle, and the class enemies would not resist but surrender their positions, allowing the kulaks to "peacefully enter" socialism, etc., to oppose agricultural collectivization.

Stalin pointed out: Bukharin, Rykov, and others are the kulaks' agents within the party. Bukharin's "theory of the extinction of class struggle" is harmful because "it will lull the working class to sleep, undermine the mobilization preparations of our revolutionary forces, demoralize the working class, and facilitate the capitalist elements' attack on the Soviet government." ("On the Right-Deviation in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," *Collected Works of Stalin*, Volume 12, Page 36.)

Under Stalin's leadership, the Soviet Party and people repeatedly and resolutely fought against Trotsky, Zinoviev, Bukharin, and other counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the party, causing their opportunist lines to suffer complete defeat. They were eventually expelled from the party.

After the Soviet Union achieved socialist national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, i.e., after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, Stalin, in November 1936, at the Eighth All-Union Congress of Soviets, delivered a report on "The Draft Constitution of the USSR." This report correctly summarized the great achievements of the Soviet socialist revolution and socialist construction and also concentratedly reflected Stalin's theoretical flaws.

In theory, Stalin did not acknowledge the existence of classes and class struggle in society during the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship. In his report on "The Draft Constitution of the USSR," he said: "The landlord class has been completely eliminated as a result of the victory of the civil war. Other exploiting classes have met the same fate as the landlord class. There is no capitalist class in industry. There is no kulak class in agriculture. There are no merchants and speculators in commodity circulation. Thus, all exploiting classes have been eliminated." The boundaries between the working class and the peasantry and between these two classes and the intelligentsia are fading, and the old class characteristics are disappearing. This means that the distances between these social groups are narrowing. "The economic contradictions between these social groups are diminishing and fading away." "The political contradictions between these social groups are also diminishing and fading away." ("Problems of Leninism," People's Publishing House, 1950 edition, Pages 800, 804.)

Stalin also said: "An example of production relations and productive forces that completely match each other is the socialist national economy of the USSR, where the public ownership of the means of production and the public nature of the production process are completely in harmony." ("Dialectical and Historical Materialism," "Problems of Leninism," Pages 864–865.)

In theory, Stalin also did not acknowledge that the outcome of the revolution had not been finally decided during the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship, and if things went wrong, the bourgeoisie could stage a comeback. In his report on "The Draft Constitution of the USSR," he said: "The complete victory of the socialist system in all sectors of the national economy is now a fact." He also said: "The phenomenon of man exploiting man has been eliminated and destroyed, and the socialist ownership of the means of production and productive forces has been established as the unshakable foundation of our Soviet society." ("Problems of Leninism," Page 800.)

However, Stalin was indeed a steadfast proletarian revolutionary. After many years of struggle and practice, in his later years, he realized that socialist society has contradictions, and if things go wrong, these contradictions could become antagonistic.

In the year before his death, 1952, Stalin published the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." In this book, he pointed out: There are still contradictions between the production relations and productive forces under the socialist system. In criticizing Yaroslavsky, he wrote: "Comrade Yaroslavsky claims that there are no contradictions between the production relations and productive forces under the socialist system. This is incorrect. Of course, our current production relations are in a period where they completely match the growth of productive forces, pushing the productive forces forward by leaps and bounds. However, if one is satisfied with this and thinks that there are no contradictions between the productive forces and production relations in our country, that would be incorrect. Because the development of production relations lags behind and will continue to lag behind the development of productive forces, contradictions undoubtedly exist and will continue to exist. Under the correct policy of the leading organs, these contradictions will not become antagonistic, and thus, there will be no conflict between the production relations and productive forces of society. If we implement incorrect policies like those recommended by Comrade Yaroslavsky, the situation will be different. In this case, conflict will be inevitable, and our production relations may become a serious obstacle to the further development of productive forces." ("Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," People's Publishing House, 1952 edition, Pages 60–61.)

After Stalin's death, the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship and implementing the restoration of capitalism. This is the greatest lesson in the history of international proletarian dictatorship.

Our great leader Chairman Mao fully paid attention to the entire history of the Soviet Union, correctly and comprehensively solving a series of major issues regarding class struggle and revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship in his series of brilliant works and instructions, in the great historical document "Notification by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966," and in the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that he personally initiated and led. This is a milestone development of Marxism-Leninism.

    学习《伟大的历史文件》的一个资料
    《红旗》杂志编者按：红旗杂志编辑部、人民日报编辑部的文章《伟大的历史文件》指出：“列宁看到了无产阶级夺取政权以后，被打败的资产阶级甚至比无产阶级还要强大，时时企图复辟，同时小生产者不断生长新的资本主义和资产阶级，威胁无产阶级专政，因此要对付这些反革命威胁，并且战胜它，必须在长时期里强化无产阶级专政，舍此没有第二条路。但因列宁逝世过早，没来得及在实际上解决这些问题。斯大林是个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他在实际上解决了很大一批钻进党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物，例如托洛茨基，季诺维也夫，加米涅夫，拉狄克，布哈林，李可夫之流。他的缺点是在理论上不承认在无产阶级专政整个历史时代社会上存在阶级和阶级斗争，革命的谁胜谁负没有最后解决，弄得不好，资产阶级就有复辟之可能。在他临死的前一年，他已觉察到了这一点，说是社会主义社会存在矛盾，弄得不好，可能使矛盾变成对抗性的。”这是非常重要、非常科学的论断。为了帮助读者理解这些科学论断，有几位同志整理了一个简略的资料。把它发表出来，供读者参考。
    列宁曾经多次论述过有关无产阶级专政的许多理论和实践问题。列宁在这方面的一些重要思想，比较集中地反映在他所写的《国家与革命》、《无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治》、《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》、《向匈牙利工人致敬》等有名的著作中。
    在无产阶级夺取政权以后的长时期内，是不是存在阶级和阶级斗争？对于这个问题，列宁作了肯定的回答。他说：“消灭阶级要经过长期的、艰难的、顽强的阶级斗争。在推翻资产阶级政权以后，在破坏资产阶级国家以后，在建立无产阶级专政以后，阶级斗争并不是消失（如旧社会主义和旧社会民主党中的庸人所想象的那样），而只是改变它的形式，在许多方面变得更加残酷。”（《向匈牙利工人致敬》。《列宁全集》第二十九卷，第三五二页。）
    列宁还说：“从资本主义过渡到共产主义是一整个历史时代。只要这个时代没有结束，剥削者就必然存着复辟希望，并把这种希望变为复辟行动。”（《无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基》。《列宁全集》第二十八卷，第二三五页。）
    列宁分析了无产阶级专政条件下各个阶级的状况和它们之间关系的变化。他强调指出，被推翻的资产阶级在长时期内还有进行反抗的条件和力量，甚至比无产阶级还要强大。剥削阶级不甘心于他们的失败。他们时时企图实现反革命复辟。
    列宁说：“在无产阶级专政下，剥削者阶级即地主资本家阶级还没有消失，也不可能一下子消失。剥削者已被击溃，可是还没有被消灭。他们还有国际的基础，即国际资本，因为他们是国际资本的一个分部。他们还有部分的生产资料，还有金钱，还有广泛的社会联系。他们的反抗力正由于他们的失败而增强了千百倍。管理国家、军事和经济的‘艺术’，使他们具有极大的优势，所以他们的作用与他们在人口总数里所占的人数相比，要大得不可计量。被推翻了的剥削者反对胜利了的被剥削者的先锋队（即无产阶级）的阶级斗争，变得无比残酷了。”（《无产阶级专政时代的经济和政治》。《列宁全集》第三十卷，第九十五页。）
    对于小生产和小生产者，列宁也作了科学的分析。他多次指出，资产阶级强大的原因之一，在于小生产的习惯势力的存在。列宁说：“资产阶级的反抗，因为自己被推翻（哪怕是在一个国家内）而凶猛十倍。它的强大不仅在于国际资本的力量，不仅在于它的各种国际联系牢固有力，而且还在于习惯的力量，小生产的力量。因为，可惜现在世界上还有很多很多小生产，而小生产是经常地、每日每时地、自发地和大批地产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。由于这一切原因，无产阶级专政是必要的”。（《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》。《列宁全集》第三十一卷，第六页。）列宁还说：“战胜强大而集中的资产阶级，要比‘战胜’千百万小业主容易千百倍。而这些小业主用他们日常的、琐碎的、看不见摸不着的腐化活动制造着为资产阶级所需要的，使资产阶级得以复辟的恶果。”（《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》。《列宁全集》第三十一卷，第二十六页。）
    列宁从这些方面着重论述了无产阶级取得政权以后阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性，提出要克服资产阶级复辟的危险，唯一的道路就是强化无产阶级专政。
    列宁说：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”（《国家与革命》。《列宁全集》第二十五卷，第四四八页。）
    总之，列宁看到了无产阶级夺取政权以后，被打败的资产阶级甚至比无产阶级还要强大，时时企图复辟，同时小生产者不断生长新的资本主义和资产阶级，威胁无产阶级专政，因此要对付这些反革命威胁，并且战胜它，必须在长时期里强化无产阶级专政，舍此没有第二条路。但列宁在一九二四年就逝世了，没有来得及在实际上解决这些问题。
    列宁逝世后，斯大林继承了列宁的伟大事业，领导苏联共产党和苏联人民，捍卫并巩固了无产阶级专政，实现了社会主义工业化和农业集体化，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就。
    斯大林是个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他在实际上解决了很大一批钻进党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物，例如托洛茨基，季诺维也夫，加米涅夫，拉狄克，布哈林，李可夫之流。
    托洛茨基等钻进党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物，是列宁主义的死敌。他们在革命的一系列重大问题上，千方百计地破坏列宁主义路线，妄图扼杀社会主义革命。
    托洛茨基反对列宁和斯大林关于社会主义可能在一国胜利的理论，提出了反动的所谓“不断革命论”，说什么在民族国家的范围内，不可能摆脱“在物质上对世界经济的依赖”，不可能自力更生地进行社会主义建设。
    托洛茨基反对无产阶级专政，硬说无产阶级专政一定会同广大农民群众发生“敌对冲突”，污蔑和攻击斯大林把国家机器发展成“前所未闻的强制工具”，“扼杀人民的独立”。
    托洛茨基还集中攻击无产阶级专政的领导力量——共产党。在列宁逝世以后，托洛茨基打着“恢复党内民主”、“反对官僚主义”、“建立集体领导”的幌子，反对以斯大林为首的党中央的正确领导，他妄图把苏联共产党（布）变成一个资产阶级的政党，即复辟资本主义的修正主义的党。
    托洛茨基还疯狂地攻击社会主义工业化和农业集体化，力图使资本主义复辟。他叫嚣苏联没有发达的工业，实现农业集体化，只是“盲目的、粗暴的和冒险性的方法”；他提出所谓“超工业计划”，企图增加对农民的赋税，破坏工农联盟，破坏城乡的经济结合，破坏工业的基础。
    季诺维也夫和加米涅夫也叫嚷什么苏联技术上经济上落后，不能达到社会主义的胜利。一九二六年夏，季诺维也夫和托洛茨基结成了反党联盟，在一系列重大问题上都同托洛茨基唱一个调子。
    斯大林写了《论列宁主义基础》、《论列宁主义的几个问题》、《问题和答复》等一系列著作，尖锐地批判了托洛茨基的机会主义谬论，捍卫了列宁主义。他指出：“不相信我国建设社会主义的可能性，就会导致取消主义和蜕化。”（《问题和答复》。《斯大林全集》第七卷，第一三九页。）斯大林认为，苏维埃政权有强大的工农联盟作依靠，在国际无产阶级和殖民地半殖民地人民的支持下，社会主义可以在一个国家内胜利。斯大林指出：托洛茨基谬论的实质，是“为建立资产阶级民主共和国扫清道路。”（《联共（布）中央委员会向第十六次代表大会的政治报告》。《斯大林全集》第十二卷，第三○八页。）斯大林揭露托洛茨基所谓“恢复党内民主”等谬论，是要瓦解党，破坏党的统一，打断党的脊椎骨。斯大林指出：托洛茨基派“口头上是工业化主义者，事实上却是工业化的敌人的帮凶。”（《关于联共（布）党内的反对派联盟》。《斯大林全集》第八卷，第二○二页。）
    拉狄克、布哈林和李可夫公开袒护富农利益，提出“阶级斗争熄灭论”，说什么社会主义获得的胜利愈大，阶级斗争愈缓和，阶级敌人将不会抵抗而让出阵地，富农可以“和平长入”社会主义，等等，以此来对抗农业集体化。
    斯大林指出：布哈林、李可夫之流是富农在党内的代办，布哈林的“阶级斗争熄灭论”的害处，“在于它会麻痹工人阶级，破坏我国革命力量的动员准备，涣散工人阶级，便利资本主义分子向苏维埃政权进攻。”（《论联共（布）党内的右倾》。《斯大林全集》第十二卷，第三六页。）
    在斯大林领导下，苏联党和人民对托洛茨基、季诺维也夫、布哈林等一批钻进党内的资产阶级代表人物进行了反复多次的坚决的斗争，使他们的机会主义路线遭到了彻底的破产，终于将他们先后清除出党。
    当苏联实现了社会主义的国家工业化和农业集体化之后，即当生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，斯大林在一九三六年十一月召开的第八次全国苏维埃代表大会上，作了《论苏联宪法草案》的报告。这个报告，正确地总结了苏联社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，同时也集中地反映了斯大林在理论方面的缺点。
    斯大林在理论上，不承认在无产阶级专政的整个历史时代社会上存在阶级和阶级斗争。他在《论苏联宪法草案》中说：“地主阶级已因国内战争胜利结束的结果而早被完全消灭了。其他剥削阶级，也遭到了与地主阶级同样的命运。在工业方面已没有资本家阶级了。在农业方面已没有富农阶级了。在商品流转方面已没有商人和投机者了。这样，所有一切剥削阶级都被消灭了。”剩下的“工人阶级与农民间以及这两个阶级与知识界间的界线，是在泯灭着，而旧时的阶级特殊性也在消失下去。这就是说，这些社会集团间的距离日益缩减下去。”“这些社会集团间的经济矛盾是在降低着，是在泯灭下去。”“这些社会集团间的政治矛盾也是在降低着，也是在泯灭下去。”（《列宁主义问题》，人民出版社一九五○年版，第八○○、八○四页。）
    斯大林还说过：“生产关系和生产力性质完全适合的实例，便是苏联的社会主义国民经济，这里的生产资料的公有制和生产过程的公共性质是完全适合的”。（《辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义》。《列宁主义问题》，第八六四——八六五页。）
    斯大林在理论上，也不承认在无产阶级专政的整个历史时代革命的谁胜谁负没有最后解决，弄得不好，资产阶级就有复辟的可能。他在《论苏联宪法草案》中说：“社会主义体系在国民经济所有一切部门中的完全胜利，现在已经是事实了。”又说：“人剥削人的现象已被铲除和消灭了，而生产工具与生产资料的社会主义所有制，已奠定为我们苏维埃社会不可动摇的基础。”（《列宁主义问题》，第八○○页。）
    然而斯大林毕竟是一个坚定的无产阶级革命家。他又经过多年的斗争实践之后，在晚年觉察到了这一点，说是社会主义社会存在矛盾，弄得不好，可能使矛盾变成对抗性的。
    斯大林在逝世的前一年，即一九五二年，发表了《苏联社会主义经济问题》一书。他在这本书中指出：社会主义制度下生产关系与生产力还存在着矛盾。他在批判雅罗申柯的一段里写道：“雅罗申柯同志断定说，在社会主义制度下，社会的生产关系和生产力之间没有任何矛盾。这是错误的。当然，我国现今的生产关系是处在这样一个时期，它完全适合于生产力的增长，一日千里地把生产力向前推进。但是，如果以此自满，以为在我国生产力和生产关系之间不存在任何矛盾，那就不正确了。因为生产关系的发展是落后于并且将来也会落后于生产力的发展，所以矛盾无疑是有的，而且将来也会有的。在领导机关的正确政策下，这些矛盾就不会变成对立，而这样也就不会弄到社会的生产关系和生产力发生冲突。如果我们执行类似雅罗申柯同志所推荐的不正确的政策，那就会是另一种情形了。在这种场合下，冲突将是不可避免的，我国的生产关系可能变成生产力进一步发展的极严重的阻碍者。”（《苏联社会主义经济问题》，人民出版社一九五二年版，第六○——六一页。）
    在斯大林逝世以后，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了第一个社会主义国家苏联的党和国家的领导，把无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。这是国际无产阶级专政历史上的最大教训。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，充分注意了整个苏联历史的经验，在他的一系列光辉著作和指示中，在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》这个伟大的历史文件中，在他亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中，正确地全面地解决了无产阶级专政条件下阶级斗争和革命的一系列重大问题。这是对马克思列宁主义的划时代的发展。
