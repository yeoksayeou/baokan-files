The People's Liberation Army is the great army personally founded by the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao. It is the army of the people. When the army was first established, Chairman Mao clearly formulated the great program for building the army: "The Red Army is a revolutionary political task force. Especially now, the Red Army is not just about fighting; in addition to fighting to annihilate the enemy's military forces, it must also undertake major tasks such as propagating to the masses, organizing the masses, arming the masses, helping the masses establish revolutionary governments, and even establishing Communist Party organizations."

Starting from this fundamental program, our army has always undertaken the three major tasks of fighting, production, and mass work in each revolutionary period. Chairman Mao also, according to the situation and tasks of each revolutionary period, timely pointed out the direction for our army. In February 1949, on the eve of national victory, Chairman Mao emphasized that "the army is not only a fighting force but mainly a working force." Last May, on the eve of the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao wrote in a letter to Vice Chairman Lin that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school," "it should also engage in mass work," and "it should also participate in the criticism of the bourgeois cultural revolution at any time." This January, at the critical moment of the power struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao wisely issued an order to the People's Liberation Army: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." "The army should not only cooperate with local authorities to manage agriculture but also manage industry." The heavy responsibilities of supporting the broad masses of the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training were entrusted to the People's Liberation Army. This is the greatest trust, care, encouragement, and exhortation from the great leader and supreme commander Chairman Mao. The matter is of great importance; we can only do it well and cannot do it poorly; we can only support the left and cannot support the right. We must resolutely respond to the call of Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and strive to learn, execute, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought and defend it resolutely. Achieve new victories in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

To implement Chairman Mao's great call for the People's Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, one must first stand on the side of the left. Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Whoever only stands on the side of the revolutionary people in words but acts differently is a verbal revolutionary. If one stands on the side of the revolutionary people both in words and actions, he is a complete revolutionary." Standing on which side is a fundamental issue of stance. Only by standing on the proletarian stance can one, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, distinguish "who is our enemy? Who is our friend?" Supporting the left is supporting the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Because the left stands on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. One can only lean to one side, to the left; one cannot lean to the right, nor can one be a wallflower, blowing in both directions. To support the broad masses of the left, one must resolutely fight against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and against the bourgeois reactionary line, and must strictly distinguish oneself from the conservatives. Any compromising ideas and actions are wrong.

The key to supporting the broad masses of the left is how to identify the left. To identify the left, one must distinguish between essence and phenomenon, mainstream and sidestream, and between the general direction and shortcomings and errors in work. Chairman Mao said: "When we look at problems, we must not forget to draw these two lines: the line between revolution and counter-revolution, and the line between achievements and shortcomings. Remembering these two lines makes things easier; otherwise, the nature of the problem will be confused." The left, tempered and tested in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has always had a good essence, mainstream, and general direction, with achievements being the main aspect. They must be affirmed and supported. At the same time, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolution with no precedents to learn from, so the broad masses of the left are bound to make various shortcomings and errors in the struggle. Regarding their shortcomings and errors, one must start from a perspective of care and enthusiastically help them correct them. One must not exaggerate their shortcomings and errors into directional errors. Our basic attitude towards the left should be to support them wholeheartedly, unreservedly, and wholeheartedly, and to patiently help them on the premise of support. The left should rectify themselves, consciously rectify themselves in terms of ideology, style, and organization, and strictly prevent the rightists from using the pretext of rectification to launch a counterattack. Whose door is open for rectification? It is open for the revolutionary masses. The door should not be open for the rightists.

On the issue of how to identify the left, one often hears some seemingly reasonable but actually misleading arguments:

"Revolutionary masses do not listen to reason." This requires class analysis and seeing whose words they listen to. The left listens to Chairman Mao's words the most, resolutely responds to Chairman Mao's calls, actively participates in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and always directs their struggle at the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road; whoever opposes Chairman Mao and defies the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, they will overthrow. The "conservative faction" seems to be "obedient and listen to reason," but they do not fight against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. On this major issue of right and wrong, they do not listen to Chairman Mao's words.

The so-called listening or not listening to reason is about whether one stands on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and whether one listens to Chairman Mao's words. We absolutely cannot decide our likes and dislikes and our choices based on whether they listen to our words.

"The left also makes mistakes." The left should be allowed to make mistakes, and we should believe that they can correct their mistakes. Let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves, learn to swim in swimming, and learn to fight in fighting. It is precisely they who, while struggling for power, propose to seize the power of the "self" in their minds. Do not be alarmed by the left's mistakes, exaggerate them, and not support them. Do not mistake the sidestream for the mainstream.

"The revolutionary mass organizations are not pure." There is nothing absolutely pure in the world. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road play tricks on this issue, proposing the reactionary theory of "natural redness," intending to confuse class lines, split the revolutionary ranks, and shift the direction of the struggle. The main criterion for determining the nature of an organization is to see which line it executes and whose hands hold the leadership. Chairman Mao said: "Especially various forms of class struggle have a profound impact on people's cognition." We value people's class status and class origin, but we oppose "class originism." We should value people's political performance in class struggle.

"Each faction has its strengths and weaknesses." This view seems fair and impartial, but it is actually biased to the right. This argument completely removes the content of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines, confuses black and white, and does not distinguish right from wrong.

"The 'conservative faction' cares about production, and the revolutionary rebels do not care about production." Is this true? No, it is the opposite. It is the revolutionary rebels who truly care about production. The revolutionary rebels have a characteristic: they grasp revolution and promote production. When the revolutionary rebels rise up in revolution, the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road incite the "conservative faction" to use production to suppress the revolution and oppose the revolution. After this trick fails, the "conservative faction," at the instigation of a few bad elements, goes out in large numbers, engages in counter-revolutionary economism, sectarianism, and slacking off, directly sabotaging production.

"I do not understand the situation." As long as the stance is correct, this problem is not difficult to solve. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been going on for more than ten months, and each faction has already "appeared." As long as one follows Chairman Mao's teachings and "goes to the masses," one can discover the true leftists and rely on them to understand more and more accurate situations. Investigation and research should first find the leftists. The most reliable materials are still provided by the leftists. If one investigates and researches without the leftists, one will definitely be deceived.

In the work of supporting the broad masses of the left, significant achievements have been made, but sometimes one may not see clearly and support the wrong side. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, but the main reasons are five more and five less, that is: being detached from the struggle between the two lines, focusing more on trivial matters and less on the general direction; being closer to the "conservative faction" and less to the revolutionary faction; being closer to cadres and less to the masses; focusing more on class origin and less on political performance; being more afraid and less daring. Waiting for a day when a perfect organization appears and then expressing support. Being afraid of making mistakes but not afraid of the party and the state changing color. The best treatment for comrades who have caught this conservative disease is to not hide their illnesses and quickly follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "go to the masses." Discovering mistakes, daring to admit them, and courageously correcting them. Only in this way can one truly understand the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, transform the objective world while transforming the subjective world, and complete the heavy task entrusted by Chairman Mao to our army to support the broad masses of the left.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the struggle to criticize the biggest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, closely unite with the broad masses of the left, fight together, and win together.

    发扬人民军队的光荣传统在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功
    李再含
    中国人民解放军是伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席亲手缔造的军队，是人民的子弟兵。我军初创，毛主席就明确制定了建军的伟大纲领：“红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。特别是现在，红军决不是单纯地打仗的，它除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”
    从这个根本纲领出发，我军在各个革命时期，一直担负着打仗、生产、做群众工作三大任务。毛主席还根据各个革命时期的形势和任务，及时地向我军指明方向。一九四九年二月，全国胜利前夕，毛主席强调了“军队不但是一个战斗队，而且主要地是一个工作队。”去年五月，无产阶级文化大革命开始前夕，毛主席给林副主席的信中指出：“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”，“又能从事群众工作”，“又要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争”。今年一月，无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的关键时刻，毛主席英明地向人民解放军发出了命令：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”“军队不但要协同地方管农业，对工业也要管。”把支援左派广大群众、支援工业、支援农业、军管、军训的重任交给了人民解放军。这是伟大领袖、最高统帅毛主席对我们的最大信任，最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大鞭策。事关重大，我们只能搞好，不能搞坏；只许支左，不能支右。我们一定要坚决响应林副统帅的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，努力学习、执行、宣传并坚决捍卫毛泽东思想。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。
    要把毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大号召付诸实现，自己必须首先要同左派站在一边。毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。”站在那一边，这是根本立场问题。只有站在无产阶级立场，才能在无产阶级文化大革命中，分清“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友”。支持左派就是支持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，就是捍卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。因为左派就是站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边的。只能一边倒，向左倒；不能向右倒，也不能墙头草，风吹两边倒。要支持左派广大群众，就要坚决向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争，向资产阶级反动路线作斗争，就必须与保守派严格划清界限。任何折衷的想法和作法，都是错误的。
    支持左派广大群众的关键是如何识别左派。识别左派，必须分清本质与现象、主流与支流，分清大方向与工作中的缺点和错误。毛主席说：“我们看问题一定不要忘记划清这两种界限：革命和反革命的界限，成绩和缺点的界限。记着这两条界限，事情就好办，否则就会把问题的性质弄混淆了。”在无产阶级文化大革命中锻炼和考验出来的左派，他们的本质、主流、大方向始终是好的，成绩是主要的。必须予以肯定和支持。同时，无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的大革命，没有前人的经验可以借鉴，因而左派广大群众在斗争中难免会出现这样那样的缺点和错误。对于他们的缺点和错误，必须从爱护的观点出发，热情地帮助他们改正。决不可把他们的缺点和错误夸大为方向性错误。我们对左派的基本态度，应该是满腔热忱地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持，在支持的前提下耐心帮助。左派整风，要通过他们自己，自觉地从思想上、作风上、组织上加以整顿，严防右派借口整风对左派实行反攻倒算。开门整风是对谁开门？是对革命群众开门。对右派不能开门。
    在如何识别左派问题上，经常听到某些同志似是而非的议论：
    “革命群众不听话。”这要作阶级分析，看是听谁的话。左派最听毛主席的话，坚决响应毛主席的号召，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命，斗争矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；谁反对毛主席，谁违抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，他们就革谁的命。“保字派”表面上好象“老实听话”，但就是不向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开斗争。对于这样一个大是大非问题，他们没有听毛主席的话。
    所谓听话不听话，就是看是不是站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，听不听毛主席的话。我们绝不能以是否听自己的话而决定爱憎和弃取。
    “左派也犯有错误。”对左派要允许他们犯错误，相信他们犯了错误可以改正。让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己，在游泳中学会游泳，在斗争中学会斗争。正是他们，在夺权斗争的同时，提出了夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。不要看到左派一有错误，就觉得不得了，夸大起来，而不支持他们。切不可把支流当做主流。
    “革命群众组织不纯。”世界上绝对纯的东西是没有的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是在这个问题上耍花招，他们提出所谓“自来红”这个反动的血统论，其用心在于混淆阶级阵线，分裂革命队伍，转移斗争的大方向。决定一个组织性质的主要标准是看它执行的是那条路线，领导权掌握在什么人手里。毛主席说：“尤以各种形式的阶级斗争，给予人的认识发展以深刻的影响。”我们重视人们的阶级成份、阶级出身，同时反对“唯成份论”，我们要重视人们在阶级斗争中的政治表现。
    “各派组织各有优缺点。”这种看法貌似公正、不偏不倚，其实向右偏得很。这种论调完全抽掉了两个阶级、两条路线斗争的内容，混淆黑白，是非不分。
    “‘保字派’关心生产，革命造反派不关心生产。”是这样吗？不是。恰恰相反，真正关心生产的是革命造反派。革命造反派有一个特点，就是抓革命、促生产。当革命造反派起来革命的时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就煽动“保字派”用生产压革命，反对革命。这一手破产以后，“保字派”在极少数坏人挑动之下，大批外出，大搞反革命经济主义，宗派主义，消极怠工，直接破坏生产。
    “我不了解情况。”只要立场对了，这个问题并不难解决。无产阶级文化大革命已经十个多月了，各派组织早已“亮相”。只要遵照毛主席的教导，“到群众里面去”，就可以发现真正的左派，依靠他们，就可以了解更多的、比较准确的情况。调查研究，首先要找左派。真正靠得住的，还是左派提供的材料。撇开左派去调查研究，就一定要上当。
    在支持左派广大群众的工作中，取得了很大成绩，但是，有时候也会看得不准，支持错了。发生这种现象的原因很多，主要的原因，有五多五少，即：脱离两条路线的斗争，看枝节多，看大方向少；接近“保字派”多，接近革命派少；接近干部多，接近群众少；看出身成份多，看政治表现少；怕字多，敢字少。空想有朝一日出现一个十全十美的组织时，再表示支持。怕自己犯错误，却不怕党和国家变颜色。得了这种保守病的同志，最好的治疗方法，就是不要讳疾忌医，赶快遵照毛主席的教导，“到群众里面去”。发现错误，敢于承认，勇于改正。只有这样，才能真正领会以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，完成毛主席赋予我军支持左派广大群众的重任。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，与左派广大群众紧密团结起来，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
