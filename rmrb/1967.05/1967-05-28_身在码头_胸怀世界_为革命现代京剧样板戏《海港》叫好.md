On the day of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*, the revolutionary model opera *The Harbor* was presented to the audience. This opera portrays the heroic image of the Chinese working class in the 1960s, showcasing the dock workers' spirit of "standing on the dock, embracing the world," and praises typical figures like Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a new victory for the revolution of Peking opera, and it is another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!

We watched *The Harbor* and felt particularly close to it. During the great "January Revolution" storm, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings and went to the docks of Shanghai Harbor to fight side by side with the revolutionary workers. During the days of countering the counter-revolutionary economic wind, at the critical moment of the united seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary factions, and during the high tide of revolution and production, we spent countless sleepless nights with them. How many excellent workers like Fang Haizhen and Gao Zhiyang appeared before us! They are the pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and they are our role models.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are created for them and for their use." *The Harbor* follows this teaching of Chairman Mao and successfully portrays the internationalist spirit of the Chinese working class, "standing on the dock, embracing the world." "To support the world revolution, even if it means climbing the knife mountain and crossing the fire sea, the Chinese working class will not hesitate." These are the lyrics sung by the dock worker Gao Zhiyang, and they also represent the firm will of the broad masses of dock workers. We will never forget: when a small clique of those in power who took the capitalist road in the former Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, together with the ghosts and snakes in society, spread the counter-revolutionary economic wind, the broad masses of dock workers stood up to complete the task of supporting the Vietnamese and Asian, African, and Latin American peoples on time, fighting day and night. "The people who have already won the revolution should help the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Chairman Mao's teaching makes the broad masses of workers in Shanghai Harbor never forget the three-fifths of the world's oppressed and exploited class brothers. They say: "Shanghai Harbor is directly connected with foreign countries. Every bag of rice and every box of materials we transport is a blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. The earlier our goods are shipped out, the earlier our Asian, African, and Latin American brothers will use them, and this is our contribution to the world revolution." Sleep can be reduced, sweat can be increased, but the foreign aid mission cannot be delayed for a moment. An old worker even did not go home for 27 consecutive days. The lofty internationalist spirit of the working class deeply educates us. Today, we see on the stage the image of the Chinese working class full of internationalist spirit, and we are so moved and happy!

The greatest achievement of the revolutionary model opera *The Harbor* is that it portrays and praises the working class in the socialist era. An old worker in his fifties said to us while watching the opera, "I have lived for several decades and never thought that I could see an opera about our workers. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, and it is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!" This is the heartfelt words of the working class and also the highest praise for *The Harbor*. In the old society, those "laborers" and the bourgeoisie called the dock workers "stinky threes." Not only were there no operas about workers on stage, but they did not even have the right to watch operas in the audience! Under Chairman Mao's leadership, workers have stood up politically. However, under the control of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, although workers have stood up in the audience, they have not yet stood up on the stage. Now, workers have taken the stage as masters, and they have also stood up on the stage.

The workers in *The Harbor*, looking at the great situation of "revolutionary winds sweeping the world," are determined to "dedicate themselves to the world revolution and struggle for life." This heroic spirit is the spirit of the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought in the socialist era.

Shanghai Harbor was the place where we fought. When our great leader Chairman Mao knew that we were in the harbor, he enthusiastically encouraged us, saying, "Good!" This is the greatest concern for our young generation. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, go deep among the workers and peasants, and walk the path of integrating with workers and peasants for life. At present, we are determined to continue to hold high the great banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, to thoroughly criticize and repudiate the revisionist literary black line, to overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, to adhere to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in literature and art, and to let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on the cultural front!

    身在码头　胸怀世界
    ——为革命现代京剧样板戏《海港》叫好
    同济大学东方红兵团政宣组
    在欢庆毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的日子里，革命现代京剧样板戏《海港》同观众见面了。这出戏，塑造了六十年代中国工人阶级的英雄形象，表现了装卸工人“身在码头，胸怀世界”的豪情壮志，歌颂了象方海珍、高志扬这些高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的典型人物。这是京剧革命的新胜利，这是毛泽东思想的又一个伟大胜利！
    我们看了《海港》这出戏，感到特别亲切。在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，我们遵循毛主席的教导，曾经奔赴上海港码头，和革命派的工人并肩战斗。在反击反革命经济主义恶风的日子里，在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的关键时刻，在抓革命、促生产的高潮中，我们和他们一起度过了多少个不眠的夜晚，多少个象方海珍、高志扬那样的优秀工人出现在我们的身边。他们是无产阶级文化大革命的闯将，他们是我们学习的榜样。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”《海港》遵循了毛主席这一教导，成功地表现了中国工人阶级“身在码头，胸怀世界”的国际主义精神。“为了支援世界革命，哪怕是上刀山，下火海，咱们中国工人阶级决不推辞。”这是装卸工人高志扬抒发胸怀的唱词，也是广大码头工人的坚强意志。我们永远不会忘记：在旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，大刮反革命经济主义黑风的时候，广大码头工人，为了及时完成支援越南和亚非拉人民的任务，挺身而出，昼夜战斗。“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”毛主席的这个教导，使上海港的广大工人念念不忘世界上三分之二被压迫被剥削的阶级弟兄，他们说：“上海码头是直接和外国联系的，我们每运一袋米，每运一箱器材，都是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的一个打击。我们的货早运出一天，亚非拉兄弟就会早用上一天，这就是我们对世界革命多一份贡献。”觉可以少睡，汗可以多流，援外任务一刻也不能丢。有一个老工人还一连二十七天没回家。工人阶级的这种崇高的国际主义精神，深深地教育了我们。今天，我们又在舞台上看到了洋溢着国际主义精神的中国工人阶级的形象，我们是多么激动，多么高兴啊！
    革命现代京剧样板戏《海港》最大的成就，就在于它表现和歌颂了社会主义时代的工人阶级。一位五十多岁的老师傅在看这出戏的时候，语重心长地对我们说：“我活了几十年，想不到今天能看到演咱们工人的京戏，这都是毛主席领导的结果，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！”这是工人阶级的心里话，也是对《海港》的最高的评价。在旧社会里，那些“苦力”、资产阶级老爷们把码头工人叫做“臭瘪三”，不要说台上不演工人的戏，就是连台下看戏的资格也没有啊！在毛主席领导下，工人在政治上翻身了。可是，文艺界在一小撮反革命修正主义分子把持下，工农兵在台下虽然翻了身，在台上却还是没有翻身。现在，工人以主人翁身份登上了文艺舞台，就在台上也翻了身。
    《海港》中的工人，眼望“全世界闹革命风起云涌”的大好形势，决心“献身于世界革命，奋斗终身。”这种英雄气概，正是社会主义时代用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级的气概。
    上海港码头曾经是我们战斗过的地方，当我们伟大的领袖毛主席知道我们在海港时，曾经热情地鼓励我们说：“很好！”这是对我们年青一代最大的关怀。我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，深入工农群众，走一辈子同工农相结合的道路。当前，我们决心继续高举无产阶级的革命批判大旗，大批特批修正主义的文艺黑线，打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在文化阵地上高高飘扬！永远飘扬！

    站在码头放眼望，反帝怒火燃四方。
    心雄志壮浑身胆，千包万袋练铁肩……
    有了党，唤醒了受苦的人们怒火烧，砸开那手铐脚钌，才换来新中国海港红旗飘！
