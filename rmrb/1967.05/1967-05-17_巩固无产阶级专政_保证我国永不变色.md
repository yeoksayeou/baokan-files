	Editor's Note: After the publication of the article "The Essence of 'Cultivation' is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" by the editorial departments of _Red Flag_ magazine and _People's Daily_, revolutionary masses across the country have organized numerous study sessions and discussions.

	This article hits the nail on the head regarding the essence of the book "Cultivation," as well as the essence of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. Throughout the article, it uses facts and logic to thoroughly refute revisionism and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought on a fundamental revolutionary issue. The publication of this article provides a powerful ideological weapon for the broad revolutionary masses who are currently engaged in the great criticism movement.

	The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party attempts to use his poisonous weed "Cultivation" to lull the revolutionary people into complacency, making us forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, so as to achieve his plot of restoring capitalism. We must thoroughly criticize "Cultivation," expose the treacherous face of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, grasp this key issue, and thoroughly settle accounts with their crimes of betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must further deepen the great criticism movement against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

	Consolidate the Dictatorship of the Proletariat to Ensure China Never Changes Color

	Wang Dabin, Member of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality, Leader of the Dongfanghong Commune, Beijing Institute of Geology

	The article "The Essence of 'Cultivation' is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" has stripped off the mask of the author of "Cultivation," exposing the traitorous face of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party to the world, which is truly heartening. Combining the hard-fought struggles of our institute over the past year, I have gained great enlightenment and education from this article.

	Lenin once pointed out: "The experience of all revolutions, this experience of world-historical significance, this economic and political lesson of world-historical significance, which Marx summed up, gave in a simple, strict, precise, and clear formula: the dictatorship of the proletariat."

	In his brilliant work "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," Chairman Mao also pointed out:

	"Summarizing our experience, concentrating on one point, is the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class (through the Communist Party) and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This dictatorship must unite with the revolutionary forces of the world. This is our formula, this is our main experience, this is our main program."

	The author of "Cultivation" is a thoroughgoing revisionist who knows how to oppose and sabotage the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. He attempts to peddle revisionist goods through "Cultivation," making us forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby achieving his evil goal of restoring capitalism.

	The fundamental issue of all revolutions is the issue of power. The purpose of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is to seize back the power usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and return it to the hands of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, and to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The Dongfanghong warriors of our institute have, in the course of more than a year of arduous struggle, never forgotten class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. We have firmly followed Chairman Mao's words and acted according to his teachings. In the struggle for the great alliance and seizure of power by the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, we have achieved one victory after another. Our journey forward along the course charted by Chairman Mao is the most powerful criticism of "Cultivation"!

	A handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party within our institute, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, have usurped the power of our institute. For a long time, they have practiced bourgeois dictatorship, resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, suppressed the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, peddled black revisionist goods, cultivated revisionist seedlings, and attempted to restore capitalism in our institute.

	On June 1, 1966, Chairman Mao personally approved the publication of the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country, and the flames of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat burned fiercely across the country. Under Chairman Mao's great call, the revolutionary teachers and students of our institute immediately joined the battle, aiming directly at the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the bourgeois academic "authorities," and launched a heroic struggle against them.

	On June 20, we overturned the bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the work team, seized back the leadership of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and engaged in arduous struggles against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and their lackeys.

	Our country's Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a mass movement of unprecedented scale in which the masses rise up to liberate and educate themselves, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, and to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The great dictatorship of the proletariat has ensured the smooth progress of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, in turn, has made our state apparatus of the dictatorship of the proletariat even more consolidated.

	Why, in some units and regions, has Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line not been implemented for a long time, and has the revolutionary faction of the proletariat been suppressed and persecuted? It is because the power in these units and regions has been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, who practice bourgeois dictatorship against the revolutionary faction of the proletariat!

	To carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end and to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat must rebel against the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and seize back the power from their hands. The broad Dongfanghong warriors of our institute, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary things, if you do not overthrow them, they will not fall." We have resolutely refuted all slander and defamation, resolutely rebelled against the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely seized the power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

	In the course of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we have waged a resolute struggle against all kinds of revisionist trends. Those who view things with the eyes of "Cultivation" think that our actions are "excessive" and "leftist adventurism." However, history has proven: our resolute revolutionary actions are completely correct and in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. If we had followed the way of "Cultivation," it would only have led to the abortion of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

	At present, in our great criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, we must closely combine the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought. We must carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end. In this way, we can consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that China's socialist mountains will never change color.

专栏：

    编者按：《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部的文章《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》发表以后，广大革命群众纷纷组织了学习和讨论。
    这篇文章击中了《修养》一书的要害，也击中了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的要害。通篇用摆事实、讲道理的方法，在一个革命的根本问题上，大破修正主义，大立毛泽东思想。这篇文章的发表，为正在开展革命大批判的广大革命群众，提供了强大的思想武器。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，妄想通过他的大毒草《修养》来麻痹革命人民，要我们忘记无产阶级专政，以便实现他复辟资本主义的阴谋。我们要把《修养》批深批透，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批倒批臭，就要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘无产阶级专政，抓住这个要害问题，彻底清算他们背叛无产阶级专政的罪行，进一步深入地开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动。
    巩固无产阶级专政  保证我国永不变色
    北京市革命委员会常委  北京地质学院东方红公社负责人  王大宾
    《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇文章，剥掉了《修养》作者的假面具，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的叛徒嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下，真是大快人心。结合我院近一年来艰苦斗争的实践，我从这篇文章中受到极大的教育和启发。
    列宁曾经指出：“历次革命中这个有历史意义的经验，这个有全世界历史意义的——经济的和政治的——教训，马克思把它总结了，给了一个简单、严格、准确、明显的公式：无产阶级专政。”
    毛主席在《论人民民主专政》这篇光辉著作中也指出：
  “总结我们的经验，集中到一点，就是工人阶级（经过共产党）领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。这个专政必须和国际革命力量团结一致。这就是我们的公式，这就是我们的主要经验，这就是我们的主要纲领。”
    《修养》的作者是一个地地道道的修正主义者，他很懂得怎样反对和破坏无产阶级革命事业。他正是妄图通过《修养》贩卖修正主义货色，使我们忘记无产阶级专政，从而达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    一切革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级文化大革命的目的，就是要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派篡夺了的政权，重新夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，就是要加强无产阶级专政。
    我院东方红战士，在近一年多的艰苦斗争中，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，坚定地听毛主席的话，按毛主席的教导办事，在无产阶级革命派大联合夺权的斗争中，取得了一个又一个的胜利。我们沿着毛主席指引的航道前进的历程，就是对《修养》最有力的批判！
    我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，篡夺了我院的大权。长期以来，实行资产阶级专政，抵制、反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，镇压无产阶级革命派，大肆贩卖修正主义黑货，培养修正主义的苗子，妄图在我院实现资本主义复辟。
    去年六月一日，毛主席亲自批准发表了全国第一张马列主义的大字报，无产阶级文化大革命的烈火在全国各地熊熊地燃烧起来。在毛主席的伟大号召下，我院广大革命师生立即投入战斗，矛头直指党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，向他们展开了英勇的斗争。
    六月二十日，我们又造了工作组执行的资产阶级反动路线的反，把无产阶级文化大革命的领导权夺了回来，并且同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其爪牙们，进行了艰苦的斗争。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政的条件下，由群众起来自己解放自己，自己教育自己，以防止资本主义复辟，巩固和加强无产阶级专政的一次空前规模的群众运动。伟大的无产阶级专政保证了无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行，无产阶级文化大革命又反过来使我们的无产阶级专政的国家机器更加巩固。
    为什么在一些单位，一些地区，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线长期得不到贯彻执行，无产阶级革命派受到打击、压制？就是因为这些单位、这些地区的权，被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派篡夺了，他们对无产阶级革命派实行资产阶级专政！
    为了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为了巩固和加强无产阶级专政，无产阶级革命派就必须造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，从他们手里把权夺回来。用毛泽东思想武装起来的我院广大东方红战士，牢牢地记着毛主席的教导：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”坚决地驳斥了一切诽谤和诬蔑，坚决起来造资产阶级反动路线的反，坚决起来夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们同形形色色的修正主义思潮进行了坚决的斗争。用《修养》的眼光来看问题的人，认为我们的行动“过火”了，是“左倾盲动”。但是，历史证明：我们坚决的革命行动是完全正确的，是符合毛主席的教导的。如果按《修养》的那一套去办，那只能导致无产阶级文化大革命的夭折。
    当前，在我们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开大批判、大斗争中，要密切结合本单位的斗、批、改，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。这样就能巩固和加强无产阶级专政，保证我国的社会主义江山永不变色。
