The All-China Journalists Association delegation and the Japanese Journalists' Federation delegation to China signed a joint statement in Beijing today. The Japanese Journalists' Federation delegation to China stated in the joint statement that the "Notice" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, is a great historical document. It explains that the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has solved the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, defended and consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat, and opened the road to the transition from socialist society to communist society.

The Japanese Journalists' Federation delegation praised in the joint statement that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong has further strengthened China's role as a bastion of world revolution. The victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution has greatly inspired the Japanese people who are fighting against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries.

The joint statement said that both sides agreed that Chairman Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the greatest leader of all the people of the world. Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is a great milestone in the history of the development of Marxism, marking a new stage in the development of Marxism. Mao Zedong Thought has transcended the boundaries of a single country and has become the most powerful ideological weapon for the people of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and is a common treasure of the people of the world.

The joint statement said that Chairman Mao Zedong has repeatedly expressed support for the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people. Chairman Mao said: "Although the road of struggle is tortuous, the future of the Japanese people is bright. The Chinese revolution has gone through countless twists and turns, victories, defeats, and then victories again. The final victory belongs to the people. The Japanese people have hope." Chairman Mao's support and encouragement for the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people have given the Japanese people tremendous spiritual strength and will have a profound impact.

The joint statement said that in the current international situation, the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries has deepened and their strength has grown. In the world revolutionary base of China, the proletarian cultural revolution has achieved great victories; Mao Zedong Thought is spreading rapidly around the world and is increasingly penetrating people's hearts. These are major decisive factors in the development of the world revolutionary situation. At present, American imperialism is becoming increasingly isolated. American imperialism is the common enemy number one of the people of the world, and the people of the world must form the broadest international anti-American united front to defeat American imperialism.

The joint statement pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique has betrayed the world revolutionary people and has degenerated into the biggest accomplice of American imperialism. They are splitting and destroying the anti-imperialist, national liberation, and peace-preserving struggles of the people of the world everywhere. To oppose imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism, and one must not include the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership in the anti-American united front, nor must one engage in any "joint actions" with them.

The joint statement condemned the Sato government of Japan and its collusion with American imperialism, accelerating the revival of militarism and adopting an overt anti-China policy. The statement condemned the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist elements for openly opposing Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China, obstructing the friendship and exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan. The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist elements have degenerated into lackeys of American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the Japanese reactionaries. To advance the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist elements.

The joint statement said that the Japanese Journalists' Federation delegation stated: For the revolutionary journalists of Japan to carry out the struggle, they must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and strive for greater development of the revolutionary journalists' movement.

The joint statement said that the Japanese Journalists' Federation delegation pointed out: The Japanese Journalists' Association has degenerated into an anti-people, anti-China organization and has lost the qualifications to represent the revolutionary and progressive journalists of Japan. At the same time, it has also lost the qualifications to have a position in the Asian-African Journalists' Movement and the Asian-African Journalists' Association.

The joint statement said that the All-China Journalists Association delegation believes: The Japanese Journalists' Federation is the inheritor and defender of the revolutionary tradition of Japanese journalists, is the true representative organization of Japanese revolutionary journalists, and is an important force in the Japanese revolution. The Chinese delegation clearly stated: It fully supports the revolutionary actions taken by the Japanese Journalists' Federation led by Chairman Kobayashi Yuichi and the Japanese revolutionary journalists united around it to oppose the American and Japanese reactionaries and modern revisionism, and reaffirms the severance of all relations with the Japanese Journalists' Association controlled by revisionist elements.

The joint statement said that both sides expressed their resolute support for the revolutionary line of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and their struggle against any plots to sabotage the Asian-African Journalists' Association.

At the signing of the joint statement, the signatories were Mu Xin, head of the All-China Journalists Association delegation, and Vice Head Lu Bin; Kobayashi Yuichi, head of the Japanese Journalists' Federation delegation to China, and Vice Head Kojima Shogo, along with other members of the two delegations.

After the signing, a tea party was held to celebrate the signing of the joint statement.

Attending the signing ceremony and tea party were responsible persons from various news units in the capital and representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction.

Chairman of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, Qia Huaduo, and members of the Secretariat, Manuwila, Ahmed Gora Ibrahim, Sugiyama Shihei, Supeno, and Uma Said, as well as Japanese friends Nishizono Koji and Ide Junichiro, and Tanzanian friend Said Salim Abdulla, also attended the signing ceremony and tea party.

    中华全国新闻工作者协会代表团日本记者同盟访华代表团签署共同声明
    毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展史上的伟大里程碑
    苏修集团背叛世界革命人民，已堕落成为美帝的最大帮凶
    新华社二十四日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会代表团和日本记者同盟访华代表团，今天在北京签署了一项共同声明。日本记者同盟访华代表团在共同声明中指出，最近发表的中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》是一个伟大的历史文件，它说明了中国无产阶级文化大革命解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题，保卫和巩固了无产阶级专政，开辟了由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的道路。
    日本记者同盟代表团在共同声明中赞扬说，毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，进一步加强了中国作为世界革命堡垒的作用。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，大大鼓舞了正在为反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和日本反动派而进行斗争的日本人民。
    共同声明说，双方一致确认：毛泽东主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是全世界人民的最伟大的领袖。毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展史上的伟大的里程碑，标志着马克思主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想已越过一个国家的范围，成为全世界人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最强有力的思想武器，是世界人民的共同财富。
    共同声明说，毛泽东主席过去多次发表谈话支持日本人民的反美爱国斗争。毛主席说：“尽管斗争道路是曲折的，但是日本人民的前途是光明的。中国革命经过无数次的曲折，胜利、失败、再胜利、再失败，最后的胜利属于人民。日本人民是有希望的。”毛主席对日本人民的革命斗争的支持和鼓舞给予日本人民以巨大的精神力量，必将发生深远的影响。
    共同声明在谈到当前的国际形势时说，世界人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的革命斗争更加深入，力量日益强大。在世界革命根据地的中国，无产阶级文化大革命已取得伟大胜利；毛泽东思想在全世界迅速传播，日益深入人心。这都是世界革命形势发展的重大的决定性因素。目前，美帝国主义已经越来越孤立。美帝国主义是世界人民共同的头号敌人，世界人民必须组成最广泛的国际反美统一战线，打败美帝国主义。
    共同声明指出，苏联现代修正主义领导集团背叛世界革命人民，已堕落成为美帝国主义的最大帮凶。他们到处分裂和破坏世界人民的反帝、民族解放和维护和平的斗争。要反对帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义，绝不能把以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义包括在反美统一战线之内，也绝不能同他们搞什么“联合行动”。
    共同声明谴责日本佐藤政府和美帝国主义勾结，加紧复活军国主义和采取露骨的反华政策。声明谴责日共修正主义分子公开反对毛泽东思想和中国共产党的革命路线，阻挠中日两国人民的友好和往来。声明说，日共修正主义分子已堕落成为美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和日本反动派的走卒。为了使日本人民的革命斗争向前发展，必须和日共修正主义分子进行坚决的斗争。
    共同声明说，日本记者同盟代表团表示：日本革命的新闻工作者为了开展斗争，必须活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想武装自己，争取革命的新闻工作者运动更大的发展。
    共同声明说，日本记者同盟代表团指出：日本记者会议已经堕落成为反人民、反华的组织，丧失了代表日本革命的、进步的新闻工作者的资格。同时，它也失去了在亚非新闻工作者运动和亚非新闻工作者协会里占有地位的资格。
    共同声明说，中华全国新闻工作者协会代表团认为：日本记者同盟是日本新闻工作者革命传统的继承者和捍卫者，是真正代表日本革命新闻工作者的组织，是日本革命的一支重要力量。中国代表团明确表示：全面支持以小林雄一为主席的日本记者同盟和团结在它周围的日本革命新闻工作者为反对美日反动派和现代修正主义所采取的革命行动，并重申与修正主义分子控制的日本记者会议，断绝一切关系。
    共同声明说，双方表示，坚决支持亚非新闻工作者协会的革命路线，同任何破坏亚非新闻工作者协会的阴谋作斗争。
    在共同声明上签字的是中华全国新闻工作者协会代表团团长穆欣、副团长吕彬；日本记者同盟访华代表团团长小林雄一、副团长小泉省吾和这两个代表团的其他成员。
    签字以后举行了茶会，庆祝共同声明的签订。
    出席签字仪式和茶会的有首都各新闻单位的负责人和无产阶级革命派代表。
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多和书记处成员曼努维拉、艾哈迈德·高拉·易卜拉欣、杉山市平、苏佩诺和乌玛·赛义德，以及在北京的日本朋友西园寺公一、井出润一郎，坦桑尼亚朋友赛义德·萨利姆·阿卜杜拉等，也出席了签字仪式和茶会。
