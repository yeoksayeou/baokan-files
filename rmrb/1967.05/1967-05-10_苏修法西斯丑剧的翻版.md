Recently, the French revisionist group led by Roche dispatched thugs to brutally attack and disrupt a rally organized by the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. This was a blatant display of fascist behavior.

The French revisionist group claims to be "Marxist-Leninists." However, they shamelessly desecrated and tore up the portraits of the great revolutionary leaders Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, which were hung on the stage of the rally hall. They also tore up the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." This proves that they are terrified of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They are thoroughgoing traitors to Marxism-Leninism.

The French revisionist group claims to be "communists." However, they frenziedly tore down the banner reading "Workers of the world and oppressed nations, unite!" This proves that they are strike-breakers masquerading as communists and enemies of the revolutionary communist party.

The French revisionist group claims to be friends of the Vietnamese people and pretends to support the Vietnamese people's struggle. However, they used such barbaric methods to disrupt a rally in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism. This fully exposes their despicable role as henchmen of American imperialism.

The fascist farce performed by the French revisionist group is not their own invention but something they learned from the Soviet revisionist group. The disciple follows the master. Today, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist group, police and secret agents running amok in public has become an everyday occurrence. Thus, the various lackeys who follow the Soviet revisionist group's commands also imitate them. Haven't the Japanese Communist Party revisionists shown this already? The recent actions of the French revisionist group are nothing more than a Paris version of the Soviet revisionist group's suppression of Asian, African, and Latin American students' pro-Vietnam demonstrations in Moscow. The difference is that the Soviet revisionist group relies on the state machinery they control to carry out fascist dictatorship, while the French revisionist group and others seek the help of the bourgeois state machinery and collude with reactionary police to carry out these fascist acts. However, whether it is the Soviet revisionists or the French revisionists, they have to resort to fascist violence to deal with revolutionary people and forces. This, apart from showing that these traitors and strike-breakers are extremely reactionary and cowardly, proves what else?

Modern revisionists think that by taking fascist violent actions, they can intimidate Marxist-Leninists. This is sheer delusion. True proletarian revolutionaries, true Marxist-Leninists, are fearless. They are not afraid of imperialism, so how can they be afraid of you, the henchmen of imperialism? "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." The French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) and all French Marxist-Leninists will hold high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and more resolutely fight against imperialism and modern revisionism, advancing the revolutionary cause of the French people and making greater contributions to the common cause of the international proletariat.

    苏修法西斯丑剧的翻版
    最近，法修罗歇集团竟然派遣暴徒，对法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）所组织的支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的群众集会，进行野蛮的袭击和捣乱。这完全是一派法西斯行径。
    法修集团自称是“马克思列宁主义者”。但是，他们竟然放肆地侮辱和公然撕毁挂在举行集会的大厅主席台上的伟大的革命领袖马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席的像，公然撕毁《毛主席语录》。这就证明他们对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想怕得要死，他们是彻头彻尾的马克思列宁主义的叛徒。
    法修集团自称是“共产党人”。但是，他们竟然疯狂地撕毁会场上悬挂的“全世界无产者和被压迫民族联合起来”的横幅标语。这就证明他们完全是挂着共产党招牌的工贼，是革命的共产党的敌人。
    法修集团自称是越南人民的朋友，装腔作势地表示支持越南人民的斗争。但是，他们竟然使用如此野蛮的手段来破坏声援越南人民抗美救国斗争的群众集会。这就彻底暴露他们充当美帝国主义帮凶的卑鄙面目。
    法修集团表演的这种法西斯丑剧，并非它自家的发明创造，而是从苏修集团那里学来的。有其师必有其徒。今天，在苏修集团统治下的苏联，军警特务当众逞凶，已属家常便饭。于是，那些跟着苏修集团的指挥棒团团打转的大小娄罗们也就起而效尤。日共修正主义分子在这方面不是早有表现了吗？法修集团最近的行径，也不过是苏修集团在莫斯科镇压亚非拉留学生援越示威的巴黎版罢了。所不同者，苏修集团是靠着他们所控制的国家机器来实行法西斯专政；而法修集团等等，则是求助于资产阶级的国家机器，同反动警察勾结起来干这种法西斯勾当。但是，苏修也好，法修也好，他们不得不乞灵于法西斯暴行来对付革命人民和革命力量，这除了说明这些叛徒和工贼们的极端反动而又极端怯懦以外，还能说明什么呢？
    现代修正主义者以为采取法西斯暴力行动，就可以把马克思列宁主义者吓倒。这完全是痴心妄想。真正的无产阶级革命战士，真正的马克思列宁主义者，是大无畏的。帝国主义尚且不怕，难道会怕你们这些帝国主义的帮凶？“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）和法国一切马克思列宁主义者，必将更高地举起马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，更坚决地进行反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争，把法国人民的革命事业推向前进，为国际无产阶级的共同事业作出更大的贡献。
