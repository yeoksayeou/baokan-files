The workers, peasants, and soldiers of New China have become the masters of the new era. Let us reverse the history that has been turned upside down.

The great work of Chairman Mao, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," has been republished, greatly inspiring the revolutionary masses across the country who are waging a revolutionary struggle against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. With boundless love, admiration, respect, and loyalty for the great leader Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically hail the 25th anniversary of the publication of this epoch-making masterpiece, hail it as another major event in China's political life following the public release of the Central Committee's "Notification," and hail the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art.

From the banks of the Huangpu River to the Pamir Plateau, from the Greater Khingan Range to the shores of the South China Sea, in many cities, villages, offices, factories, schools, shops, and units of the People's Liberation Army across the country, celebrations and various activities were held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." People, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work again at this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, feeling particularly close and deeply moved. At many commemorative meetings and discussions, people repeatedly shouted with great enthusiasm: "Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts! Long live! Ten thousand years live!" Revolutionary masses, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, and revolutionary cadres from all over the country unanimously pointed out that our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work creatively formulated the most complete, thorough, and correct proletarian line in literature and art. It is the eternal guiding light for the revolutionary literature and art of China and the world, the programmatic document guiding the great proletarian cultural revolution to victory, and at this moment when the revolutionary masses are waging a great struggle against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and in the great advance to thoroughly liquidate the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art, the republished "Talks" has brought us the most powerful ideological weapon. We must firmly hold high the banner of the revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, use the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, combine the great struggle and criticism against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party with the criticism of the revisionist black line in literature and art and the struggle-criticism-transformation in our units, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

In the decisive stage of the great proletarian cultural revolution, the revolutionary masses, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, and the broad revolutionary masses in the capital re-studied the brilliant work of the great leader Chairman Mao, feeling particularly close. They realized from the revolutionary struggles of the past 25 years, especially from the struggles of the great proletarian cultural revolution over the past year, that the "Talks" is the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism in literary theory, the sharpest weapon to defeat modern revisionism and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art represented by the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the guiding light for the great proletarian cultural revolution to achieve a thorough victory, and the criterion to distinguish between revolution and counter-revolution or non-revolution, and between Marxism and revisionism. They pointed out that the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists under his protection, such as Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, and Zhou Yang, fear the "Talks" like ghosts fear sunlight. They maliciously attacked the "Talks," distorted the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers proposed by Chairman Mao, and put forward the counter-revolutionary revisionist theory of "literature and art for the whole people," making the entire literary and artistic circles filled with poisonous weeds and the stage dominated by ancient people, foreigners, and the dead. Their goal is to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a more intense struggle and criticism against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists under their support, seize back all the leadership, including the leadership in the literary and artistic circles, from their hands, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, and let the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought occupy all the literary and artistic fronts, making the new literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers shine brightly, and ensuring that our proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai held various activities such as meetings, discussions, and artistic performances to celebrate the republished work of Chairman Mao. More than 300 "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams" composed of workers, peasants, Red Guards, and soldiers went deep into factories, docks, workers' new villages, rural areas, and towns across the city to widely carry out artistic performances to propagate the "Talks." The revolutionary young people of the Tongji University East Is Red Headquarters Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team said that in the past, under the control of counter-revolutionary revisionists, the literary and artistic circles were dominated by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and literature and art became tools for restoring capitalism. Now, we revolutionary masses have seized power from the small group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and we must firmly grasp the great power in literature and art, making literature and art a powerful weapon to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary miners of the Taiyuan Xishan Coal Mine Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team have been breaking through the old artistic frameworks since the beginning of the cultural revolution and performing "The Rent Collection Courtyard" for the workers, which was warmly welcomed by the workers. Today, after re-reading the "Talks," they are full of fighting spirit and went to the streets to carry out propaganda activities. They said: We will drive those emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, foreigners, and ancient people off the stage, and overthrow the literature and art of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism! For thousands of years, the history that has been turned upside down by the exploited classes, we will turn it back! Jia Jincai, the director of the poor and lower-middle peasants' association of Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, said excitedly after hearing the news of the republished "Talks" by Chairman Mao: A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists eat the food and wear the clothes of the working people, but they do not serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Instead, they put makeup on emperors, generals, young masters, and young ladies, and sing praises for landlords and capitalists. They want to restore capitalism, which is a daydream. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never agree!

The republished "Talks" by Chairman Mao pushed the activities commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Talks" in the mountain city of Guiyang to a new high. The entire mountain city was immersed in the festive atmosphere. More than 2,000 workers, peasants, and soldiers in literary and artistic circles and revolutionary literary and artistic workers expressed at the celebration meeting that they would definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of the "Talks," further carry out the class struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic front, seize back all the power held by the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles to the hands of the revolutionary masses, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end. After the meeting, more than 2,000 literary and artistic warriors formed 40-plus propaganda teams and performance teams and went to various parts of the city to carry out propaganda and performances. The revolutionary workers of the Guiyang Cotton Mill expressed their excitement: The republished "Talks" greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses and crushed the arrogance of the class enemies. We workers must step onto the literary and artistic stage, firmly grasp the great power in literature and art in our hands, and make literature and art forever serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve our proletarian politics.

At the special meeting held by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee yesterday to celebrate the republished "Talks," the chairman of the committee Wang Xiaoyu, deputy chairman and responsible person of the Jinan Military Region Yang Dezhi, deputy chairman and responsible person of the Shandong Red Guards Command Department Wang Zhucuan, responsible person of the Shandong Red Guards Literary and Art Rebel Headquarters Li Qingyou, and responsible person of the Jinan Military Region Li Yaowen all enthusiastically praised the brilliant work of the great leader Chairman Mao as not only the compass and guide for the literary and artistic front but also the compass and guide for all work. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, and thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the black line's biggest backer, the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The broad workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Heilongjiang Province read the brilliant work of Chairman Mao with joy and excitement. The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Harbin Peking Opera Troupe said: We commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Talks" and must hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more actively participate in the great struggle and criticism against the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles under their support, and seize all the literary and artistic fronts from their hands. Sun Maosong, a labor model of Heilongjiang Province and a worker of the Harbin Oxygen Generator Factory, said, "We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The current cultural revolution is only the first one, and there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, the restoration of capitalism is possible at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be vigilant and never relax.'"

The broad cadres and revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Navy, Air Force, Railway Corps, and the leadership organs of the Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, and Jinan military regions solemnly held meetings to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Talks." Everyone unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the "Talks" as a guide, closely watch the class struggle on the literary and artistic front, firmly and unshakably implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strive for new and greater victories in the great proletarian cultural revolution, and fight to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!

The revolutionary masses, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, revolutionary cadres, and the broad cadres of the People's Liberation Army at various commemorative meetings and discussions all unanimously expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's "Talks" and other works in the struggle, further understand and grasp the theory, line, principles, and policies of the great proletarian cultural revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, firmly advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, develop socialist new culture, and fight to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!

    把被颠倒的历史再颠倒过来
    亿万军民纪念《讲话》二十五周年，热烈欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线巨大胜利，为发展社会主义新文化，保卫无产阶级专政而斗争
    据新华社二十四日讯　毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》重新发表，极大地鼓舞了向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命大批判的全国各地无产阶级革命派、革命文艺工作者、革命群众和解放军广大指战员。他们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限敬仰、无限忠诚的心情，热烈欢呼这部划时代的天才著作发表二十五周年，欢呼这是继中共中央《通知》公开发表之后我国政治生活中的又一重大事件，欢呼毛主席的革命文艺路线的巨大胜利。
    从黄浦江边到帕米尔高原，从大兴安岭到南海之滨，我国许多城市、农村、机关、工厂、学校、商店和人民解放军部队，都举行了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的纪念会、座谈会，以及各种庆祝活动。人们满怀革命豪情，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战时刻，重新学习毛主席这篇光辉著作，感到特别亲切，体会格外深刻。在许多纪念会和座谈会上，人们一遍又一遍地热情高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”各地的无产阶级革命派、革命的文艺工作者和革命群众一致指出：我们伟大领袖毛主席的这部光辉著作，创造性地制定了最完整、最彻底、最正确的无产阶级文艺路线，是中国和世界革命文艺的永放光辉的指路明灯，是指导无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的纲领性文件，在无产阶级革命派正在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判，实行总攻击的时刻，在彻底清算反革命修正主义文艺路线的大进军中，《讲话》的重新发表，给我们送来了最强大的思想武器。我们一定要高高举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，以光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，同批判修正主义的文艺黑线，同本单位的斗批改结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    首都无产阶级革命派、革命的文艺工作者和广大革命群众，在无产阶级文化大革命的决战阶段重温伟大领袖毛主席的天才著作，感到格外亲切。他们从二十五年来的革命斗争中，特别是从一年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中体会到，《讲话》是当代马克思列宁主义文艺理论的最高峰，是战胜现代修正主义和彻底摧毁以党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的最锐利的武器，是无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的指路明灯，对待《讲话》的态度，是区别革命、不革命或反革命的标志，是区别马克思主义或是修正主义的标志。他们指出，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其包庇下的彭真、陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，象魔鬼害怕阳光一样十分害怕《讲话》，恶毒地攻击《讲话》，篡改毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，提出反革命修正主义的“全民文艺”论，把整个文艺界搞得毒草丛生，古人、洋人、死人充斥舞台，其目的就是要颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其支持下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子展开更猛烈的大批判、大斗争，把他们所窃踞的领导权，包括文艺界的领导权，统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，彻底肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线的流毒，让战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想占领一切文艺阵地，让为工农兵服务的社会主义新文艺大放异彩，使我们的无产阶级铁打江山永不变色。
    上海的广大无产阶级革命派、革命的文艺工作者和革命群众纷纷举行集会、座谈会、文艺演出等各种活动，庆祝毛主席的光辉著作重新发表。由工人、农民、红卫兵小将和解放军战士组成的三百多个“毛泽东思想宣传小分队”，深入全市工厂、码头、工人新村、农村和集镇，广泛展开宣传《讲话》的文艺演出活动。同济大学东方红总部毛泽东思想宣传小分队的革命小将说，过去在反革命修正主义分子控制下的文艺界，帝王将相、才子佳人统治着舞台，文艺成为复辟资本主义的工具。现在，我们无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺了权，我们一定要牢牢掌握文艺的大权，使文艺成为宣传毛泽东思想、保卫无产阶级专政的有力武器。
    太原西山煤矿革命派矿工组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，文化大革命开始以来，就突破陈腐的艺术框框，为矿工们演出了《收租院》，受到工人群众的热烈欢迎，今天，他们重读了《讲话》，又满怀战斗激情走上街头展开宣传活动。他们说：我们要把那些帝王将相、才子佳人、洋人古人统统从舞台上赶下去，把封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的文艺统统打倒！千百年来被剥削阶级颠倒了的历史，我们要重新颠倒过来！山西省昔阳县大寨大队贫协主任贾进才听到重新发表毛主席《讲话》的消息后，激动地说：一小撮反革命修正主义分子吃着劳动人民的饭，穿着劳动人民的衣，就是不为工农兵服务，反而为帝王将相、少爷小姐涂脂抹粉，为地主、资本家歌功颂德，喝采叫好。他们要复辟资本主义，这是白日做梦，我们贫下中农坚决不答应！
    毛主席的《讲话》重新发表，把山城贵阳连日来纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年的活动推向了一个新高潮，整个山城沉浸在节日的气氛里。两千多工农兵文艺战士和革命文艺工作者，在欢呼《讲话》重新发表的庆祝大会上表示：一定要更高地举起《讲话》的革命旗帜，进一步开展文艺战线上两条路线的阶级斗争，把被反革命修正主义分子在文艺界所把持的一切权力统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手里来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。会后，两千多文艺战士分成四十多支宣传队和演出队，分赴全市进行宣传和演出。贵阳棉纺厂革命派广大职工激动地说：《讲话》的重新发表，大长了我们无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风。我们工人阶级就是要登上文艺舞台，把文艺大权牢牢掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手里，让文艺永远为工农兵服务，为我们的无产阶级政治服务。
    在山东省革命委员会昨天专门举行的欢呼《讲话》重新发表的座谈会上，革命委员会主任委员王效禹，副主任委员、济南部队负责人杨得志，副主任委员、红卫兵山东指挥部负责人王竹泉，红卫兵山东文艺造反总司令部负责人李庆有，济南部队负责人李耀文等，都热烈地颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作不仅是文艺战线的方向盘和指南针，而且是一切工作的方向盘和指南针。他们表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，彻底批判反革命修正主义文艺黑线，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭这条黑线的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。
    黑龙江省广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情，重读了毛主席的光辉著作。哈尔滨市京剧团的革命文艺工作者说：我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，就要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，更积极地投身到对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以及在他们支持下的文艺界反革命修正主义分子的大批判、大斗争中去，把他们所盘踞的一切文艺阵地统统夺到无产阶级手里来。黑龙江省劳动模范、哈尔滨市制氧机厂工人孙茂松说，我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”
    解放军海军、空军、铁道兵和北京、沈阳、广州、济南等部队领导机关广大指战员和革命文艺工作者，隆重集会纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年。大家一致表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以《讲话》为指针，密切注视文艺战线上的阶级斗争，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的更大胜利，为捍卫无产阶级专政而斗争！
    各地的无产阶级革命派、革命的文艺工作者、革命群众和解放军广大指战员在纪念会、座谈会上都一致表示，要在斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席的《讲话》和其它著作，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的方向前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为发展社会主义新文化，为保卫无产阶级专政而斗争！
