The People's Liberation Army, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and boundless loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, has been earnestly studying the "Notice" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a document of great historical significance. Over the past few days, in conjunction with the great practice of the entire army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, they have been discussing the importance of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the importance of firmly holding the gun in order to defend the power, and the long-term nature of the struggle against restoration under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The more they discuss, the deeper they understand Chairman Mao's theory and practice regarding the necessity of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the prevention of capitalist restoration. They resolutely declare: They must never forget the power, always maintain high class vigilance, and create a strong atmosphere of the dictatorship of the proletariat; they must never forget the military power, and ensure that the people's gun is always in the hands of the defenders of the dictatorship of the proletariat; they must remember Chairman Mao's teaching that the victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that the proletarian heaven remains red for generations to come!

The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army's call for the entire army to study the "Notice" has further advanced the tide of studying the "Notice." Many units, upon receiving the directive, immediately held discussions to study the significance of this great historical document and rearranged their study plans. They demand that through study, they further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further deepen the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, especially to firmly establish the concept of power, never forget the power, and always be the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

On patrol ships, at the edge of the airfield, in vast camp areas, and on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, the soldiers and officers discuss their experiences from participating in and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. They deeply realize that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the focus of class struggle is still the issue of "power." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are fighting with us over this "power." They say: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies who have infiltrated our ranks. To defend the power, we must root out these most dangerous enemies. We must not only be ready at any time to smash the external enemies who openly use force to seize our power but also pay serious attention to the big and small Khrushchevs within who secretly steal our power. The officers and soldiers of the "Political Border Model Company" stationed on the Ruili River have seen from countless facts of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the historical lessons of the Soviet revisionist clique's usurpation of the Party, the military, and the government that enemies without guns are more dangerous than those with guns. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and all the big and small counter-revolutionary revisionists are enemies without guns. Our struggle with them is a life-and-death battle. If we do not completely defeat them, our country will change color. They say: We must fully implement the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, mobilize the masses from the bottom up, and fight a people's war, burying them all in the vast ocean of the people's war. Hu Shougen, a first-class combat hero of a certain air force unit, said in a discussion that they guard the country's airspace day and night to defend the "power" of the proletariat. The U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits create disturbances and sabotage, and their target of attack is also this "power." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, and their target is also this "power." We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "all revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power," and in our minds, raise the vigilance of class struggle, and be ready at any time to smash the conspiracies of domestic and foreign enemies.

The broad officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, as the strong pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat, have the deepest understanding of the need to defend the power by firmly holding the gun. Fan Gengxu, deputy squad leader of a certain unit in the Beijing Garrison, said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a powerful army." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road want to usurp the proletarian power and collude with another leader of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique who has infiltrated the army, attempting to usurp military power. Once the time is ripe, they will seize our power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. This is a pipe dream! The people's gun must always be in the hands of Chairman Mao's soldiers. The officers and soldiers also pointed out that countless facts show that any attempt by class enemies to usurp the military and the Party will never succeed. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another leader of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique who had infiltrated the military was exposed, which is the first great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our army and a great victory in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, tempered in the fiery class struggle, have a clearer understanding today of the long-term nature of class struggle in the socialist period and the long-term nature of the struggle against restoration under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Zhang Cai'an, the platoon leader of a certain transport company, an advanced unit in studying the works of Chairman Mao, said: The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is extremely great, but class struggle is far from over. Many representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the military, and the cultural circles, although already exposed and overthrown by us, will still produce new bourgeois elements in the future. Revolution cannot be achieved once and for all, nor can we fantasize that a few cultural revolutions will make the world peaceful and trouble-free. We must carry forward the spirit of continuous revolution, increase our vigilance a hundredfold, further consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end. Guo Xiaosi, an active element in studying the works of Chairman Mao in a certain unit who bravely defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, said: We revolutionary soldiers must remember Chairman Mao's teaching that at any time we must not forget class and class struggle, must not forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and must not relax our fighting will. We must follow Chairman Mao and make revolution for life, vowing to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that our socialist iron mountain remains red forever.

    人民解放军誓做无产阶级专政坚强柱石
    广大指战员认真学习中共中央《通知》，决心提高革命警惕性，时刻不忘阶级和阶级斗争，使人民的枪杆子永远掌握在无产阶级专政的保卫者的手里。
    新华社二十日讯　无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想的人民解放军广大指战员，在认真学习中共中央《通知》这个具有伟大历史意义的文献中，连日来，结合全军一年来在无产阶级文化大革命中的伟大实践，大讲无产阶级专政的重要性，大讲为了保卫政权必须牢牢掌握枪杆子的重要性，大讲无产阶级专政条件下复辟反复辟斗争的长期性。指战员们越议论，对毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践领会得越深刻。他们最坚定地表示：一定要永远不忘政权，把阶级警惕性提得高高的，把无产阶级专政的气氛弄得浓浓的；一定要永远不忘军权，使人民的枪杆子永远握在无产阶级专政的保卫者的手里；一定要牢记毛主席关于革命的谁胜谁负要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决的教导，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证无产阶级的江山千秋万代不变颜色！
    人民解放军总政治部关于号召全军学习《通知》的指示，把全军学习《通知》的热潮又向前推进了一步。许多部队一接到指示立即重新座谈学习这个伟大的历史文件的意义，重新安排学习。他们要求通过学习进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，进一步深入地开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，特别是要牢固地树立起政权观念，永远不忘政权，永远不忘做无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。
    在巡逻舰艇上、在停机坪边、在广大营区里、在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的第一线，指战员们畅谈一年来参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命的体会，深刻地认识到无产阶级专政下阶级斗争的焦点，还是一个“权”字，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和我们争夺的就是一个“权”字。他们说：党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是钻进我们肝脏里最危险的敌人，我们要保卫政权，就要根除这些最危险的敌人。不但要随时准备粉碎外部敌人明火执仗地用武力来夺取我们的政权，而且更要严重注意内部的大大小小的赫鲁晓夫们悄悄地窃取我们的政权。驻守在瑞丽江边的“政治边防模范连”的干部战士们，从无产阶级文化大革命的无数事实中，从苏联修正主义集团篡党、篡军、篡政的历史教训中，看到不拿枪的敌人比拿枪的敌人有更大的危险性。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、彭真反革命修正主义集团以及大大小小的反革命修正主义分子，就是不拿枪的敌人。我们和他们的斗争，是一场你死我活的大搏斗，不把他们彻底打倒，我们的国家就要变颜色。他们说：我们一定要充分实行无产阶级专政下的大民主，自下而上地充分发动群众，打一场人民战争，把它们通通埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海中。空军某部一等战斗功臣胡寿根在座谈中说，我们日日夜夜守卫着祖国的领空，为的是保卫无产阶级的“权”。美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮对我们进行捣乱和破坏，攻击的目标也就是这个“权”，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派搞反革命复辟，目标也是这个“权”。我们一定牢记毛主席的“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的教导，在思想上提高阶级斗争的警惕性，时刻准备粉碎国内外敌人的阴谋。
    作为无产阶级专政坚强柱石的陆海空三军广大指战员，对要保卫政权，必须牢牢掌握枪杆子，体会得最深刻。北京卫戍区某部副班长范更旭说，毛主席教导我们：“军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派要篡夺无产阶级的政权，就同混进军队里的彭真反革命修正主义集团的另一个头目，勾结起来，妄图篡夺军权，阴谋一旦时机成熟，就专我们的政，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。这是白日作梦！人民的枪杆子一定要使它永远掌握在毛主席的战士的手里。指战员们还指出，无数事实说明，任何阶级敌人篡军反党的阴谋都是绝不会得逞的。这次无产阶级文化大革命中，揪出了混进军内的彭真反革命修正主义集团的另一个头目，这是我军无产阶级文化大革命第一个伟大胜利，也是巩固无产阶级专政的大胜利。
    在火热的阶级斗争大风浪中锻炼成长的人民解放军广大干部战士，今天对社会主义时期阶级斗争的长期性，对无产阶级专政条件下复辟反复辟斗争的长期性认识得更清楚了。学习毛主席著作先进单位、某部运输连连长张才安说：无产阶级文化大革命的胜利是极其伟大的，但是阶级斗争远没有结束。混进党里、政府里、军队里以及文化界里的许多资产阶级代表人物，虽然已被我们揪出来打倒了，但今后也还会产生新的资产阶级分子。革命绝不能一劳永逸，更不能幻想通过几次文化大革命，天下就可以太平无事了。我们一定要发扬不断革命的精神，百倍提高警惕，进一步巩固和加强无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底。勇敢捍卫毛主席革命路线的某部学习毛主席著作积极分子郭小四说：我们革命战士要牢记毛主席的教导，在任何时候都不能忘记阶级和阶级斗争，不能忘记无产阶级专政，不能松懈自己的战斗意志。我们要跟着毛主席闹一辈子革命，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证我们社会主义的铁打江山永远保持鲜红的颜色。
