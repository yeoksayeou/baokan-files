I understand the importance of "power." I am a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the deputy commander of the militia in Xianggezhuang Brigade, Shunyi County.

Last year at this time, when I saw Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "Criticizing the 'Three Family Village,'" I thought it was just about writing articles, and who cares about that! At that time, I did not understand what the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was all about. Later, when I saw in the newspapers the teachings of Chairman Mao: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work." I still could not grasp it. In December, I actively participated in the rural cultural revolution, because the cultural revolution was initiated and led by Chairman Mao personally. I love Chairman Mao and follow his words, doing as he teaches, caring about state affairs, and tempering myself in great storms and waves. However, I still did not clearly understand what issues the cultural revolution was meant to address. It was only after several months of struggle that I gradually came to understand that the fundamental issue of this cultural revolution is to address the issue of "power." Today, after reading the Party Central Committee's "Notice," I have a clearer understanding of the issue of seizing power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party: if the laboring people lose political power, they lose everything and will have to beg for food again with sticks!

The number one capitalist roader within the Party has been exposed. He advocates that exploitation is meritorious and rebellion is criminal. He wants to take the capitalist road and restore capitalism. We rebel against him. He uses the power he has usurped to create a white terror. If the opportunity arises, this Khrushchev of China will turn our proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship, and we will return to the evil old society. Just thinking about this makes one furious! Therefore, we must firmly grasp political power in the hands of the proletariat and never relax our vigilance. I am young, inexperienced, and impatient. In the past, when I encountered difficulties at work and could not find solutions, I did not want to continue. Now, I have been elected as a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and the revolutionary burden is heavier, and the difficulties at work are greater. But when I think that this is about the laboring people holding power, no matter how great the difficulties, I am not afraid!

After reading the Central Committee's "Notice" and reflecting on the struggles of the past few months, I have begun to understand what "creating public opinion" means. The Chinese Khrushchev advocates "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," and all kinds of ghosts and snakes spread various poisonous weeds, all to fill people's minds with the word "self." These representatives of the bourgeoisie "create public opinion," in my view, is to use the bourgeoisie's "self" to seize power in our minds. Once they seize the power in our minds, making us only care about ourselves, then it will be easy for them to usurp party power, state power, military power, economic power, and cultural power. Therefore, the most important thing is whose class holds power in our minds. In our minds, the struggle between public and private interests is always ongoing, which is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for power in our minds. To prevent the representatives of the bourgeoisie from usurping our party power, state power, military power, economic power, and cultural power, we must break down private interests and establish public interests every day, preventing them from seizing the power of "public" in our minds. In the past, I did not understand the struggle between the two classes and the two roads very well, thinking it was just about controlling a few landlords and rich peasants. Now I know that this struggle is constantly happening in our minds. If private interests become dominant, they will develop into the capitalist road. Therefore, to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship, we must first consolidate the power of "public" in our minds!

This document with great practical and historical significance has been issued. I will definitely study it with the poor and lower-middle peasants, strive to master this weapon, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and firmly grasp the power in the hands of the proletariat.

    我懂得了“权”的重要
    北京市革命委员会委员  顺义县相各庄大队民兵副指导员  王勇军
    去年这时候，看到姚文元同志的《评“三家村”》，觉得说的是写文章的问题，谁管那事！当时，我根本不懂无产阶级文化大革命是怎么回事。以后，看到报上登的毛主席的教导：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。”我还是不能领会。十二月，我积极投入农村文化大革命，那是因为文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的，我热爱毛主席，听毛主席的话，要象他老人家所教导的那样，关心国家大事，在大风大浪中锻炼自己。但是，对于文化大革命究竟要解决什么问题，我仍然不很清楚。在几个月的斗争中，我才逐步懂得了这次文化大革命最根本的就是要解决“权”的问题。今天，读了党中央的《通知》，对于从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权的问题，认识得更清楚了：我们劳动人民如果失掉了政权就失掉了一切，就只有重新提起棍子要饭去！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了。他宣传剥削有功，造反有罪。他要走资本主义道路，搞资本主义复辟。我们造他的反。他就利用他篡夺的权力，搞白色恐怖。如果一旦时机成熟，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫就会把我们的无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，我们就会回到万恶的旧社会。一想到这里，真叫人气愤！所以，我们一定要把政权紧紧抓在无产阶级手里，一刻也不能放松。我年纪轻，没经验，脾气又急，过去工作中遇到困难想不出办法，就不大想干了。现在我被选为北京市革命委员会委员，革命的担子更重了，工作中的困难也更多了。可是一想到这是为劳动人民掌权的问题，困难再大，我也不怕了！
    看了中央的《通知》，回顾这几个月的斗争，我也开始懂得什么叫“造舆论”了。中国的赫鲁晓夫宣扬什么“吃小亏，占大便宜”，大大小小的牛鬼蛇神放出各种毒草，无非是要使人的头脑里塞满“私”字。这些资产阶级代表人物“造舆论”，我看也就是用资产阶级的“私”字来夺我们头脑里的权。夺了我们头脑里的权，使我们变成只顾自己的人，这样，他们再来篡党、篡政、篡军，就都容易了。所以，最要紧的是脑子里的权属于哪个阶级。在我们的脑子里，公和私的斗争时刻都在进行，这就是无产阶级和资产阶级在我们脑子里头进行夺权斗争。要防止资产阶级代表人物篡夺我们的党权、政权、军权、财权、文权，就得天天破私立公，防止他们夺我们头脑里公字的权。过去，我对两个阶级、两条道路的斗争也很不理解，以为也不过就是管制好那么几个地主富农罢了。现在才知道，在我们头脑里就时时都有这种斗争。要是私心多了，发展下去，就会走上资本主义道路。因此，要巩固无产阶级的政权，就得先巩固“公”字在我们脑子里的权！
    《通知》这一有伟大现实意义和历史意义的文件发表了，我一定要同贫下中农一起好好地学习，努力掌握这一武器，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把印把子紧紧地掌握在无产阶级手里。
