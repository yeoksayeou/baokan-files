The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement expresses the support of a powerful motherland. Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots are determined to fight to the end with the Hong Kong British authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 15th - According to today's report by the Hong Kong "New Evening News," workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon who are in the midst of the struggle enthusiastically support the statement from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They excitedly say: Our motherland has spoken; with the support of a powerful motherland, we are even less afraid of the reactionary and decadent British imperialism, and we have even more confidence to carry this anti-persecution struggle to the end and achieve final victory. They warn the Hong Kong British authorities: They must immediately and unconditionally accept the five serious demands proposed in the statement from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs; otherwise, all consequences arising from this must be fully borne by the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities.

The report says that the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" and "Ta Kung Pao" both published extra editions at noon today, reporting that our country's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Luo Guibo, summoned the British Charge d'Affaires, Hopkinson, this morning to hand over the statement from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing the most urgent and strongest protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities against Hong Kong Chinese workers and residents. Workers from various industries in the midst of the struggle were overjoyed upon seeing the extra editions. They said: The great socialist motherland has always been the most reliable backing for Hong Kong compatriots. With the support of a powerful motherland, with seven hundred million compatriots in the motherland as our backing, and with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon for struggle, we are not afraid of the reactionary Hong Kong British authorities. The Hong Kong British authorities, following the U.S. imperialists, oppose the great new China and dare to persecute Chinese compatriots and workers. They will only get the result of "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet." Many workers, after reading the extra edition's publication of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement, cheered: "Long live the great socialist motherland!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The report says that workers from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union, who are at the forefront of the struggle, were deeply moved upon seeing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement. Workers from the Hong Kong artificial flower factory and other rubber factories immediately read the statement aloud and sang "The East Is Red," reciting Chairman Mao's words, "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, surmounting every difficulty to win victory." They unanimously expressed their firm support for our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' solemn statement, warning the Hong Kong British authorities to immediately and unconditionally accept the five serious demands proposed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement. They pointed out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement solemnly declares: "The Chinese government and people are determined to carry this struggle to the end." This is the strongest support for our struggle. We rubber industry workers have made up our minds to unite with workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon and resolutely carry the struggle against the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable persecution to the end.

    外交部声明表达了强大祖国的支持
    港九同胞决心同港英当局斗争到底
    新华社香港十五日电　据香港《新晚报》今天报道，斗争中的港九各业工人热烈拥护我外交部的声明，他们兴奋地说：我们的祖国发言了；我们有强大的祖国支持，更加不怕反动的腐朽的英帝国主义，更加有信心把这场反迫害斗争进行到底，夺取最后胜利。他们警告香港英国当局：必须立即无条件接受我外交部声明中提出的五项严正要求，否则，由此引起的一切后果，必须由英国政府和香港英国当局完全负责。
    报道说，香港《文汇报》、《大公报》今天中午都出版号外，报道我国外交部副部长罗贵波今晨召见英国代办霍普森，面交我国外交部声明，最紧急、最强烈抗议香港英国当局对香港中国工人和居民的法西斯暴行的消息。在斗争中的各业工人看到号外后欢欣鼓舞，他们说：伟大的社会主义祖国从来都是香港同胞最可靠的靠山，我们有强大的祖国支持，有祖国七亿同胞做后盾，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想做我们斗争的武器，我们决不害怕反动的香港英国当局。香港英国当局追随美帝国主义，反对伟大的新中国，胆敢对中国同胞和工人进行迫害，他们只会得到“搬起石头打自己的脚”的结果。许多工人在读到号外刊载的外交部声明之后，欢呼：“伟大的社会主义祖国万岁！”
  “中国共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    报道说，站在斗争最前列的港九树胶塑胶业总工会的工人们看到外交部声明后无限激动。香港人造花厂和其他胶业工厂的工人们看到声明后立即高声朗读，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，朗读毛主席语录“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们一致表示坚决拥护我国外交部的严正声明，警告香港英国当局必须立即无条件接受我外交部声明中提出的五项严正要求。他们指出，我国外交部声明中庄严地宣告：“中国政府和中国人民决心把这场斗争进行到底。”这是对我们斗争的最强最强的支持，我们胶业工人已经下定决心，要和港九各业工人团结在一起，坚决把反对香港英国当局无理迫害的斗争进行到底。
