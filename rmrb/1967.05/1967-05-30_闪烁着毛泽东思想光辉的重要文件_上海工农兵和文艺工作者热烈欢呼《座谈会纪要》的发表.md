A document radiating the splendor of Mao Zedong Thought—Shanghai workers, peasants, soldiers, and cultural workers enthusiastically welcome the publication of the "Summary of the Conference"

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally revised the "Summary of the Conference on Army Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" three times. Its publication is a major event in the political life of our people.

Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses, who have undergone the great test of the "January Revolution" storm, enthusiastically welcome the publication of the "Summary of the Conference." Our reporter invited representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as Red Guards, to hold a symposium. Below are the speeches from this symposium.

Firmly Holding the "Two Whips" to Defend the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

Deputy Political Instructor Xu Shuren of the Eighth Company of Nanjing Road said: Comrade Jiang Qing presiding over the conference on army art work is the greatest concern, support, and encouragement from our great leader Chairman Mao to our army. This is a major event in the political life of our army.

Our beloved Deputy Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao said, "The pen and the gun are the two whips for seizing power." He also said, "Art can have the effect of a gun and can have effects that a gun cannot." The class struggle of the past seventeen years has fully proven this important truth. "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, enemies without guns still exist." They see that their plot to use "guns" against us cannot succeed, so they use the cultural power they have stolen to use the "soft knife" method to secretly achieve "peaceful evolution" in people's minds, attempting to prepare for the recovery of the "paradise" they have lost.

The struggle practice of the proletarian cultural revolution over the past year has deeply educated us: under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the main content of class struggle is the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat to restore and counter-restore. The revolutionary pen is an important weapon in this class struggle, and we must not be complacent. The publication of the "Summary of the Conference" further inspires us. We will definitely, together with the broad leftist revolutionary faction of the proletariat, firmly hold the revolutionary gun, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat to the death.

Turning the Inverted History Back to Its Original State

Worker revolutionary rebel team member Wu Shuyang of the Fifth Loading and Unloading Area of Shanghai Port said: Chairman Mao said in his letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe after watching "Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain": "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all old literature and art that is separated from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, ruled by masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring the true face of history." We port workers have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's brilliant statement after studying the "Summary of the Conference."

In the more than ten years since liberation, the stage is still ruled by "masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies." Revolutionary cultural workers want to break through this reactionary control, sing the praises of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are met with resistance and sabotage everywhere. The creation process of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Port" has deeply exposed the reactionary nature of the counter-revolutionary revisionist art black line. We port workers are participants and the most authoritative witnesses of this class struggle.

The creation process of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Port" has undergone a serious class struggle. Initially, due to the intervention of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements in the cultural circle, the party branch secretary was depicted as a "sentimental, tear-stained" mediocrity. An old worker on the dock who has deep class feelings for the party and Chairman Mao was vilified as a rude, savage, and unreasonable "greenwood hero." These tricks of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag were immediately seen through by us dock workers. Workers angrily said: "Safety helmets, shoulder cloths, such people are not worthy to wear them. If they wear them, the power will no longer be in the hands of the working class." Comrade Jiang Qing responded to Chairman Mao's call, leading the vanguard fighters of the cultural revolution, and launched an attack on a small group of reactionaries who sabotaged the revolution of Beijing opera and inverted history. After a hard and fierce struggle, the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Port" has appeared in its current new look, becoming a model play that turns the inverted history back to its original state. We port workers will never forget Comrade Jiang Qing's hard work and outstanding contributions.

Speaking the Hearts of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

Commissioner Lu Meiying of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai County said: The "Summary of the Conference" is an important document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, full of proletarian revolutionary spirit and class feelings. It completely speaks the hearts of us workers, peasants, and soldiers. We, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside, will definitely study it well, familiarize ourselves with it, master it, use it, and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist art black line in the countryside, so that the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought can be planted in every position in the countryside.

In the past few years, the workers, peasants, and soldiers we saw on the stage and screen were not the heroic images of our class brothers, but were vilified as ignorant and stupid mobs. A group of bourgeois lords in the cultural circle spared no effort to blacken the faces of our class brothers. The proletarian cultural revolution made us see clearly: this is the trick of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. They eat the food of our poor and lower-middle peasants, support the rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and landlords, and want to restore capitalism in our country, seize power again, and make us retrace our steps, suffer again. Our great leader Chairman Mao first saw through the tricks of these counter-revolutionary revisionists, led us to carry out a magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, and dragged these guys out one by one, knocking them down to the ground. We can't help but shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

Breaking Through a New Realm of Mao Zedong Thought

Liu Guichun of the Shanghai Youth Drama Troupe said: The publication of the "Summary of the Conference" is a great joy for our cultural circle. Revolutionary cultural workers are all excited and applauding!

I joined the army's cultural work team in 1947. When the country was liberated, I entered the city with the army. Over the years of fighting life, I have established a deep affection with the army's cultural work team. In 1951, the biggest power-holder within the party who took the capitalist road ordered the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang to cut down many cultural work teams across the country, and I also had to leave the army's cultural work team and study at the Shanghai Drama Academy's performance department's worker-peasant class. Three years of study did not teach me more skills to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. After graduation, I joined the Shanghai Youth Drama Troupe. Under the control of some so-called "experts" and "authorities," this troupe performed only foreign, famous, and ancient plays, such as "Much Ado About Nothing" and "The Peony Pavilion," etc. They also actively promoted the "three excellences" and "three highs" policies of the total head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist art black line Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, luring us young cultural workers to pursue fame and profit. All of this is completely different from my past life in the army. Chairman Mao wants our literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but why are there no positions for workers, peasants, and soldiers on the stage, and let foreigners and the dead defile our socialist stage? Chairman Mao called on cultural workers to go to the countryside and factories to reform their thoughts and feelings, but why can't we go down for a year, not combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but only dig into old papers, looking for what "character images." It was not until this magnificent proletarian cultural revolution that my eyes were opened: it turns out that in the cultural field, the bourgeoisie has seized our power! Now, looking back and studying the "Summary of the Conference," I feel especially intimate! In the old society, I was a poor child who sang for a living. It was the party and Chairman Mao who nurtured me into a revolutionary cultural worker. Now, the proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao has liberated me from the shackles of the revisionist literary and art line. I am determined to follow Chairman Mao forever, take the "Speech" as a guide, take the "Summary of the Conference" as a weapon, stand with the revolutionary comrades in the cultural circle, and definitely break through a new realm of Mao Zedong Thought in literature and art!

Swearing to Be the Masters of New Proletarian Revolutionary Literature and Art

Resident You Song, an amateur poet from the Shanghai Shipyard, said: Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, our working class has not only stood up politically and economically but also culturally. We have picked up the pen, stepped onto the cultural stage, and sung loudly about our great Communist Party of China, sung loudly about the eternal red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, sung loudly about our great socialist motherland, and sung loudly about our great heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang not only do not allow the praise of workers, peasants, and soldiers, do not allow literature and art to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but also use the method of "peaceful evolution" to try to drag us down, turning us into tools for their capitalist restoration. We workers who hold the pen work in the factory and live in the factory, have the deepest feelings for the factory, and are most familiar with the workers. We talk about workers and sing about factories, and we can't talk enough or sing enough. They, however, maliciously say that the factory is "dry and boring," seeing only hammers and machines, writing only about hammers and machines, and not being able to write "good" works. They want us to put down the hammers, throw away the machines, and go to the "study class" held by a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists to learn. There, they recite "level tones, level tones, falling tones, falling tones" all day, making us dizzy and almost "raising" a non-martial, non-literary, revisionist literary and art successor who is detached from the practical struggle.

It is our heart's reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, who pointed out the direction for us. Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Speech" that the struggle life of the people is "the inexhaustible and boundless source of all literature and art." I am a worker. If I put down the hammer and leave the workshop and the worker masses, it is like a drop of water falling on the sand, which will immediately dry up. The "Summary of the Conference" thoroughly peeled off the mask of this small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, exposing their true colors. We also saw through their wolfish ambitions from our personal experiences, and we will no longer be fooled by them.

The "Summary of the Conference" revised by our great leader Chairman Mao encourages us: "We should be proud to be thorough revolutionaries. We should have confidence and courage to do what our predecessors have not done, because our revolution is a revolution to finally eliminate the exploiting class, the exploiting system, and fundamentally eliminate all the ideological poisons of the exploiting class that harm the people." We, the amateur creators of workers, peasants, and soldiers, will bravely move forward along the broad path opened up by the "Summary of the Conference." We will exchange labor for new poems, knock out songs with hammers, let the proletarian literature and art bloom forever, and let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the globe!

We Must Seriously Study the "Summary of the Conference"

Li Baixiang of the "Jinggangshan Red Flag" Combat Team of Shanghai Fudan University said: The tens of millions of Red Guards in Shanghai most enthusiastically welcome the publication of the "Summary of the Conference on Army Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing"!

When Comrade Jiang Qing presided over the conference on army art work, it was also the time when the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen was concocting the counter-revolutionary "February Outline." One "Summary of the Conference" and one "February Outline" are two diametrically opposed documents, two classes, two roads, two lines, with clear camps and direct confrontation.

After liberation, for a long time, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique within the party, Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and their backers, used the power they had stolen to brazenly peddle bourgeois literary and art thoughts, modern revisionist literary and art thoughts, and black goods from the 1930s, poisoning revolutionary people. A year ago, the "Summary of the Conference" formulated under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing proposed the great task of thoroughly eliminating the anti-party, anti-socialist black line. Now, Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and their backers have been dragged out, and the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have launched a comprehensive and destructive criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist art black line. This is the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We deeply understand that the revolutionary road is not smooth. This is a long, arduous, and complex struggle. We must seriously study the "Summary of the Conference," take the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and resolutely fight against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and against the bourgeois art black line!

    闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的重要文件
    ——上海工农兵和文艺工作者热烈欢呼《座谈会纪要》的发表
    本报讯　我们伟大的领袖毛主席三次亲自修改的《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》公开发表了，这是我国人民政治生活中的一件大事。
    经历了伟大的“一月革命”风暴考验的上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众热烈欢呼《座谈会纪要》的发表。本报记者邀请工农兵代表人物和红卫兵举行了座谈会，下面是这个座谈会上的发言。
    紧握“两杆子”保卫无产阶级专政
    南京路上好八连副政治指导员徐树仁说：江青同志主持召开部队文艺工作座谈会，是伟大领袖毛主席对我军的最大关怀、最大支持和最大鼓舞，这是我军政治生活中的一件大事。
    我们敬爱的副统帅林彪同志说，笔杆子，枪杆子，夺取政权靠这两杆子。又说，文艺能起到枪杆子的作用，和枪杆子起不到的作用。十七年来的阶级斗争完全证实了这条重要的真理。“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”。他们眼看着用“枪杆子”对付我们的阴谋不能得逞，就利用他们窃取到的文化大权，用笔杆子搞“软刀子割头”的办法，悄悄地在人们头脑中实现“和平演变”，妄图为夺回他们已经失去的“天堂”做准备。
    一年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，最深刻地教育了我们：在无产阶级专政的条件下，阶级斗争的主要内容就是资产阶级和无产阶级复辟与反复辟的斗争，革命的笔杆子是这一场阶级搏斗的重要武器，我们决不能掉以轻心。《座谈会纪要》的公开发表，更加鼓舞了我们。我们一定和广大无产阶级革命左派一起，把革命的枪杆子握得紧紧的，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政。
    把历史的颠倒再颠倒过来
    上海港务局第五装卸区工人革命造反队吴树扬说：毛主席在《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》中说：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目”。我们海港的革命工人学习《座谈会纪要》以后，对毛主席这一光辉的论述，有了更深刻的体会。
    解放十几年来，仍然由“老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台”。革命文艺工作者要冲破这种反动控制，歌颂工农兵英雄人物，处处受到他们的抵制和破坏。革命现代京剧《海港》的创作过程，深刻地露出了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反动性。我们海港工人是这场阶级斗争的参加者和最有权威的见证人。
    革命京剧《海港》的创作过程，经历了一场严重的阶级斗争。最初，由于文艺界的反革命修正主义分子的黑手插了进去，党的支部书记被描绘成“儿女情长、眼泪沾巾”的庸人。一位对党和毛主席怀着深厚阶级感情的码头老工人，被丑化成粗暴野蛮、不讲道理的
  “绿林好汉”。这些打着“红旗”反红旗的鬼花招，一下就被我们码头工人识破了。工人们气愤地说：“安全帽、搭肩布，这样的人不配上身，如果让他们戴上穿上，印把子就不在我们工人阶级手里了。”江青同志响应毛主席的号召，率领文化革命的先锋战士，向一小撮破坏京剧革命、颠倒历史的反动家伙发动了进攻。经过艰苦的激烈的斗争，使革命现代京剧《海港》出现了今天这样崭新的面貌，成为把颠倒的历史再颠倒过来的好样板戏。我们海港工人永远不会忘怀江青同志的辛勤劳动和卓越贡献。
    说出了我们工农兵心里话
    上海市川沙县革命委员会委员吕美英说：《座谈会纪要》是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，充满无产阶级革命精神和阶级感情的重要文件。它完全说出了我们工农兵的心里话。我们广大贫下中农和农村革命干部，一定好好学习它，熟悉它，掌握它，运用它，彻底肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线在农村的流毒，让毛泽东文艺思想的伟大红旗插遍农村的一切阵地。
    前几年，我们从舞台上、银幕里看到的工农兵，根本不是我们阶级弟兄的英雄形象，而是被丑化了的愚昧无知的群氓。文艺界的一批资产阶级老爷们，挖空心思地往我们阶级弟兄脸上抹黑。无产阶级文化大革命，使我们心明眼亮：这是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派搞的鬼。他们吃我们贫下中农的饭，撑地富反坏的腰，妄想在我国复辟资本主义，再专我们的政，让我们走回头路，吃二遍苦。我们伟大的领袖毛主席首先看穿了这些反革命修正主义分子的阴谋，领导我们进行了一场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，把这些家伙一个个地揪了出来，打翻在地。我们禁不住高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    闯出一个毛泽东思想的新天地
    上海青年话剧团刘贵琴说：《座谈会纪要》的发表，是我们文艺界的一件大喜事。革命的文艺工作者无不欢欣鼓舞，拍手叫好！
    我是一九四七年进入部队文工团的。全国解放的时候，随军进了城。多年来的战斗生活，我和部队文工团建立了深厚的感情。一九五一年，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，给反革命修正主义分子周扬下令把全国许多文工团砍掉，我也不得不离开部队文工团，到上海戏剧学院表演系工农班学习。三年的学习，我并没有学到更多的为工农兵服务的本领。毕业后，我进了上海青年话剧团。在某些所谓“专家”“权威”的把持下，这个剧团尽演些洋、名、古的戏，象《无事生非》啦，《桃花扇》啦，等等。他们还积极推行反革命修正主义文艺黑线总头目周扬和夏衍的“三名”主义、“三高”政策，引诱我们青年文艺工作者追名逐利。所有这一切与我过去在部队的生活，完全是两个天地。毛主席要我们文学艺术为工农兵服务，可是，为什么舞台上没有工农兵的地位，而让洋人、死人玷污我们社会主义的舞台？毛主席号召文艺工作者下乡下厂改造思想感情，为什么我们终年下不去，不与工农兵结合，只钻故纸堆，找什么“人物形象”。直到这次轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命才擦亮了我的眼睛：原来在文艺上，是资产阶级专了我们的政！现在回过头来学习《座谈会纪要》，感到格外亲切！在旧社会，我是一个卖唱乞讨的穷孩子，是党和毛主席把我培养成一个革命的文艺工作者。现在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，又把我从修正主义文艺路线的桎梏中解放了出来。我决心永远跟着毛主席，以《讲话》为指南，以《座谈会纪要》为武器，与文艺界革命派同志站在一起，一定要闯出一个毛泽东思想的文艺新天地来！
    誓做无产阶级革命新文艺的主人
    沪东造船厂工人业余诗歌创作者居有松说：在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，我们工人阶级不但在政治上经济上翻了身，在文化上也翻了身。我们拿起了笔，登上了文艺舞台，放声歌唱我们伟大的中国共产党，放声歌唱我们心中永远不落的红太阳毛主席，放声歌唱我们伟大的社会主义祖国，放声歌唱我们伟大的工农兵英雄人物。
    但是，陆定一、周扬等反革命修正主义分子，不但不准歌颂工农兵，不准文艺为工农兵服务，而且以“和平演变”的方法，妄想把我们拉下水，变成他们复辟资本主义的工具。我们拿笔杆子的工人，做活在工厂，生活在工厂，对工厂最有感情，对工人最熟悉。我们说工人、唱工厂，说也说不完，唱也唱不尽。他们却别有用心地胡说什么工厂“枯燥无味”，看见的是鎯头机器，写的还是鎯头机器，写不出“好”作品。要我们放下鎯头，丢下机器，去一小撮反革命修正主义举办的“学习班”里学习。那里整天念什么“平平仄仄、仄仄平平”，弄得我们晕头转向，几乎“养”成了一个不文不武、脱离斗争实践的修正主义文艺接班人。
    是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席给我们指出了方向。毛主席在《讲话》中指出人民群众的斗争生活“是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉”。我是工人，如果放下了鎯头，离开了车间和工人群众，就象一滴水落在沙滩上，会立即枯竭。《座谈会纪要》彻底剥下了这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的画皮，暴露了他们的原形。我们也从切身经历中看清了他们的狼子野心，我们再也不上他们的当了。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲自修改的《座谈会纪要》鼓励我们：“应该以做一个彻底的革命派而感到自豪。要有信心，有勇气，去做前人所没有做过的事，因为我们的革命，是一次最后消灭剥削阶级、剥削制度，和从根本上消除一切剥削阶级毒害人民群众的意识形态的革命。”我们工农兵业余创作者，要沿着《座谈会纪要》开辟的宽广大道勇往直前。用劳动换来新诗篇，用鎯头敲出颂歌来，让无产阶级文艺百花永远鲜红，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照全球！
    一定要认真学习《座谈会纪要》
    上海复旦大学“井冈红旗”战斗队李百祥说：我们上海市的千千万万红卫兵小将，最最热烈地欢呼《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》公开发表！
    江青同志召开部队文艺工作座谈会的时候，也正是彭真反革命修正主义集团炮制反革命《二月提纲》的时候。一个《座谈会纪要》，一个《二月提纲》，这是两个根本对立的文件，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线，营垒分明，针锋相对。
    解放后，在很长一段时间里，党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一、周扬一伙及他们的总后台，利用他们所窃取的权力，肆无忌惮地贩卖资产阶级文艺思想，现代修正主义文艺思想和三十年代文艺黑货，毒害革命人民。一年前，江青同志主持制定的《座谈会纪要》中，提出了要彻底搞掉反党反社会主义黑线的伟大战斗任务。现在彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍一伙反革命修正主义分子以及他们的总后台已被揪了出来，亿万工农兵革命群众对反革命修正主义文艺黑线，展开全面的毁灭性的大批判。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们是毛主席的红小兵，是无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们深深懂得，革命的道路是不平坦的。这是一场艰巨、复杂、长期的斗争，我们一定要认真学习
  《座谈会纪要》，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，向资产阶级文艺黑线进行坚决斗争！
