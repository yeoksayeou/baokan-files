Macau compatriots have taken practical actions to support Hong Kong compatriots in their struggle against violence. On May 23, the Macau Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots in Their Struggle Against British Oppression was established, and a series of support actions were immediately decided upon.

Representatives from various sectors in Macau held a meeting on the evening of May 23 to announce the establishment of the Macau Committee to Support Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots in Their Struggle Against British Oppression. They elected Liang Pei and others as standing committee members.

The representatives attending the meeting were filled with indignation, strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for ignoring the statement from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the just demands of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots. They have been carrying out extremely ferocious and extremely brutal bloody suppression against our Hong Kong compatriots. The representatives resolutely declared that if the enemy attacks us fiercely, we will strike back fiercely. Hong Kong and Macau compatriots are close kin, close brothers. Macau compatriots cannot sit idly by while Hong Kong compatriots are being oppressed; we must take immediate action and join the fight.

As the representatives expressed their determination to fight, the meeting hall resonated with passionate slogans: "The British in Hong Kong will surely fail! We will surely win!" "We strongly support the solemn statement of our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs!" "We resolutely support the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against oppression!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!"

The committee issued a "Statement to All Macau Compatriots," calling on all Macau compatriots to mobilize, organize, and take action to support the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against the oppression of the British authorities. The committee made the following resolutions:

1.	Immediately establish committees to support Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots in their struggle against British oppression in various units, industries, and neighborhoods.
2.	Continue to expand denunciation, protest, and demonstration activities.
3.	Launch a widespread fundraising campaign.
4.	Organize delegations to visit and comfort patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong.
5.	Carry out the "Three Views" campaign of hatred, contempt, and ridicule against American and British imperialism, and politically defeat and overthrow them.
6.	Strive to have relatives and friends working in British military and police units in Hong Kong stand firmly on the national side, not be deceived or used by the British, and not become enemies of the Chinese people.
