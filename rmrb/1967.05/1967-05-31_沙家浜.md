**Scene 1: The Connection**

[During the Anti-Japanese War, in the region of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, where the Japanese invaders are stationed, there is a sealed road. There is a small path leading to Sangzhuang. In the foreground, there is a tree. It is midnight, and the moon is obscured by clouds.]

[Curtain opens: Qi Long, A Xiang, Wang Fu Gen lead A Qing onto the stage. A Qing: (singing in Xipi Shake)]

The county secretary sent someone to deliver a message,
The wounded comrades will arrive tonight.
The villagers accompany me to receive them...
We must beware of the patrolling Japanese soldiers.

[Chen Tianmin enters. Chen Tianmin: A Qing! A Qing: Have all the wounded comrades arrived? Chen Tianmin: They have all arrived.]

[Guo Jian Guang, Ye Si Zhong, and others enter. Chen Tianmin: Let me introduce, this is A Qing. Her public identity is the owner of the Chun Lai Tea House. This is Platoon Leader Guo. A Qing: Platoon Leader Guo. Guo Jian Guang: A Qing. Chen Tianmin: Let's cross the sealed line quickly! Guo Jian Guang: Ye, lead the comrades over. Xiao Hu: Platoon Leader! ... The Japanese patrol is coming! Chen Tianmin: Hide. (Leads everyone off the stage.)]

[A squad of Japanese soldiers patrols past.]

[Qi Long enters, surveys, and signals to A Qing and Chen Tianmin. Chen Tianmin, Guo Jian Guang, and the wounded comrades enter. A Qing, Guo Jian Guang, and Chen Tianmin shake hands and say goodbye as they leave.]

**Scene 2: The Transfer**

[Curtain opens: In front of Grandma Sha's house, there is a willow tree on the left and Grandma Sha's residence on the right. There are bamboo tables and chairs on the stage.]

[Grandma Sha is mending clothes. Xiao Ling is organizing bandages and medicine. Xiao Wang is folding sacks. Xiao Ling: Xiao Wang! Come change the dressing! Xiao Wang: I won't change it. Xiao Ling: Why not? Xiao Wang: Xiao Ling! Our medicine is so scarce; it should be used first for the seriously wounded. I'll be fine soon. Xiao Ling: The medicine is not much, but our mobile hospital will send us more supplies. Your wound is not light, but it's not heavy either. Xiao Wang: I am a lightly wounded soldier. Xiao Ling: Lightly wounded? Why didn't the platoon leader take the lightly wounded soldiers to help the villagers harvest rice?]

[Xiao Wang is speechless. Xiao Ling: Xiao Wang, come change the dressing! Xiao Wang: I just won't change it! Xiao Ling: The platoon leader told me to change your dressing! Grandma Sha: Xiao Wang, you wounded comrades must listen to the doctors and nurses. You can't be so stubborn. Xiao Ling: Look, even Grandma Sha is scolding you! Xiao Wang: Hmph! Grandma Sha likes you, so she always takes your side! Grandma Sha: You say I take her side, and I do take her side. The girl speaks and acts reasonably; I just like her! Xiao Wang: Grandma Sha, tomorrow let Qi Long go with us, and leave Xiao Ling with you. We'll exchange a girl for your boy! Grandma Sha: That would be great! In my life, I have raised seven sons, but I've never had a daughter! Xiao Ling: Grandma Sha, you always say you have seven sons, but we only see Qi Long! Grandma Sha: Sigh! Those were the old days; why bring them up! Xiao Wang: Grandma Sha, tell us about it. Xiao Ling: Grandma Sha, we all want to hear. Grandma Sha: Sigh! (singing in Erhuang Three Eyes)]

It's a long story...
In the past, we were poor and couldn't afford to raise them,
Seven sons, five died young.
During the famine, we owed a debt to the Diao family,
To repay the debt, my fourth son went to work for them.
The Diao family had a snake-like heart and a poisonous nature,
My fourth son, working day and night, was beaten to death.
Qi Long has a hot temper and a stubborn nature,
He went to the Diao family to argue.
The Diao family said he was breaking into someone's house at night, either stealing or robbing,
Poor thing, even a sixteen-year-old boy was thrown in jail.
The New Fourth Army liberated Sangzhuang,
My son was released from jail and saw the light of day again.
The Communist Party is like his own mother!

Xiao Ling: Grandma Sha, you're right!
Grandma Sha: (continuing to sing) Without the Party, we would have been ruined long ago!

[A Xiang enters with a bowl of rice balls. Xiao Wang: Grandma Sha, with the Communist Party, we poor people don't have to fear them! A Xiang: Grandma Sha! Grandma Sha: A Xiang, do you have something to say? A Xiang: My mother asked me to bring some rice balls for the platoon leader. Grandma Sha: I've steamed some too! A Xiang: My mother said this is a token of our respect for the army! Grandma Sha: That's right, put them in this basket. I'll heat them up later for them to eat! A Xiang: Xiao Wang, Li Grandma is waiting for you to take a sack to collect rice! Xiao Wang: Right! (Picks up the sack and is about to leave, then turns back) Grandma Sha! Where is that Diao family? Grandma Sha: Why, are you still thinking about that? The Diao family is dead, and he had a son who studied abroad for many years. Now, who knows where he is. Xiao Ling: Enough, don't dig up the past! Li Grandma is waiting for the sack to hide the grain! A Xiang: Let's go together. (Leaves with Xiao Wang.)]

[Grandma Sha picks up the basket, intending to go wash clothes. Xiao Ling: Grandma Sha, you're going to wash clothes again! I'll go wash them! Grandma Sha: The platoon leader took the lightly wounded comrades to help us work. I'm washing a few clothes; isn't that appropriate? Xiao Ling: I'll go with you. (Leaves with Grandma Sha.)]

[Guo Jian Guang and Ye Si Zhong row a boat onto the stage with baskets of grain. Ye Si Zhong and Guo Jian Guang carry the grain off the boat. Guo Jian Guang: Ye! (pointing to the grain) Put it in a safe place for Grandma Sha! Ye Si Zhong: Okay! (Carries the grain to the back of Grandma Sha's house.) Guo Jian Guang: (singing in Xipi Original Plate)]

The sunrise reflects on the Yangcheng Lake,
The reeds and rice scent the shore, the willows stand in rows.
All thanks to the labor of the people with their hands,
They have painted the fertile Jiangnan with fish and rice.
The homeland's good mountains and rivers will not be given up,
How can the enemy be allowed to run rampant?
Wounded in battle, leaving the front,
Recovering in Sangzhuang.
For half a month, I have missed my comrades and leaders,
(Changing to Erliu)
Also, I don't know where the transfer is.
The villagers are preparing for the counter-sweep,
When will we raise our arms and slay the wolves?
The wounded comrades eagerly await their recovery,
So that they can return to the front soon!

[Grandma Sha and Xiao Ling enter. Guo Jian Guang: Grandma Sha! Grandma Sha: Platoon Leader, the comrades have all returned! Guo Jian Guang: They have returned. The rice has been harvested, and your rice has been hidden in the cellar behind your house! Grandma Sha: Good! You must be tired; rest for a while! Look, these are the rice balls A Xiang brought for you. Guo Jian Guang: The villagers treat us so well! Xiao Ling: Platoon Leader, Grandma Sha is helping us wash clothes! Grandma Sha: This girl, it's only right!]

[Qi Long enters. Ye Si Zhong comes from the back of the house. Qi Long: Mom! I caught a fish. Grandma Sha: Qi Long, did you finish your work and then go fishing? Qi Long: To give the comrades something to eat! Grandma Sha: Bring it in, I'll prepare it. Qi Long: I'll do it! (Enters the house and leaves.) Ye Si Zhong: Platoon Leader, several comrades have applied to return to the unit! Guo Jian Guang: They are all so eager! Ye, I think part of the comrades' wounds have healed, and they can leave soon! Grandma Sha: Leave? Go where? Guo Jian Guang: To find the unit. Grandma Sha: Find the unit? That won't do. (singing in Xipi Shake)]

The comrades fought bravely and were wounded,
Sangzhuang is your home.
If the villagers have been negligent,
Speak up, and I will criticize them.

Guo Jian Guang: (looking at Ye Si Zhong) Grandma Sha is asking us to give feedback. (to Grandma Sha) Grandma Sha, I have some feedback for you! Grandma Sha: Oh! Then speak up quickly! Guo Jian Guang: Okay. (singing in Xipi Shake)

That day, the comrades talked,
Together, they discussed you, Grandma Sha.

Grandma Sha: What did they say?
Guo Jian Guang: (continuing to sing) They talked non-stop,
Grandma Sha: Oh, there were a lot of opinions!
Guo Jian Guang: (continuing to sing) Everyone praised you with thumbs up.
Grandma Sha: Look at you, Grandma Sha hasn't done anything!
Guo Jian Guang: (singing in Xipi Flowing Water)

You treat the comrades like family,
With careful care, you never fall short.
Mending and washing without stopping,
Three meals a day with fish and shrimp.
The comrades say, if we stay here long-term,
We might get fat and lazy,
Unable to walk or climb mountains,
How can we go to the battlefield and kill the enemy?
Grandma Sha: Look at you!
Guo Jian Guang: (continuing to sing) When the comrades recover,
Grandma Sha: (continuing to sing) When they recover, they won't leave my home.
You will feed them three meals a day, nine bowls of rice,
Sleep until the sun sets in the west.
Raise them until they are fat and strong,
Each one like an iron tower,
At that time, strong and powerful, riding horses into battle...
Guo Jian Guang: (continuing to sing) Galloping through Jiangnan to kill the enemy.
Eliminate traitors and bandits,
Drive the Japanese bandits back to their homeland.
When the clouds clear and the sun rises, every family will hang the red flag,
Then come to visit this revolutionary old mother.

Grandma Sha: Good! You, Grandma Sha, is looking forward to that day.
Ye Si Zhong: Grandma Sha, you will surely see it. You and the villagers treat us so well, we will definitely drive the Japanese devils out of China!
Grandma Sha: Oh?
Guo Jian Guang: Yes! “The army must blend with the people, making the army seen as their own by the people. Such an army will be invincible, and a few Japanese imperialists are not enough to defeat.”

Grandma Sha: Who said that?
Guo Jian Guang: Chairman Mao.
Grandma Sha: Chairman Mao! Those words are good!

[A Qing hurriedly enters from another direction. A Qing: Platoon Leader, the Japanese have started the "sweep"! The county committee instructs the comrades to go to the reed marsh to avoid it temporarily. The boat and dry rations, I have all prepared! Guo Jian Guang: A Qing, notify the militia to lead the villagers to evacuate and hide the remaining grain! A Qing: (to Guo Jian Guang) You can rest assured. We will go to the place we have chosen, and I will come to pick you up later! (to Grandma Sha) Grandma Sha, let Qi Long and A Xiang send the comrades off! Grandma Sha: Qi Long! You send the comrades off! (Enters the house.) Qi Long: Where is the boat? A Xiang: At the northwest corner of the village. Guo Jian Guang: Ye, tell the comrades to gather at the northwest corner of the village! Ye Si Zhong: Yes! (Leaves with Xiao Ling, Xiao Wang, and others.) A Qing: Qi Long! Row the boat carefully, and don't let anyone see!]

[Grandma Sha enters. Grandma Sha: Take these rice balls and dried cake with you. Sigh! The reed marsh is open and exposed, how can the wounded comrades endure it!]

[Qi Long takes the basket. Guo Jian Guang: Grandma Sha, we have the tradition of the Red Army climbing snowy mountains and crossing grasslands. Nothing can stop us!]

[Cannons roar. A Qing: Platoon Leader, let's go! Guo Jian Guang: A Qing! You must be careful! A Qing: I know. Guo Jian Guang: A Xiang, Qi Long, let's go! (Leaves with Qi Long and A Xiang.) A Qing: (to Wang Fu Gen) You take a few militia members and lead the villagers to evacuate. Hurry! Divide some people to hide the grain. Wang Fu Gen: Yes! (Leaves.) A Qing: Grandma Sha, you should pack your things. I'll go check on the comrades! Grandma Sha: Yes!]

[A Qing leaves, and Grandma Sha enters the house. The lights dim. Cannon and gunfire sounds grow louder, and distant fires start. Refugees flee past, and Japanese soldiers chase after them.]

[Japanese officer Hei Tian and two Japanese soldiers enter. Japanese translator Zhou Ren Sheng enters. Zhou Ren Sheng: Report. There are no New Fourth Army soldiers, and no wounded New Fourth Army soldiers. Hei Tian: You go find the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army" ... (whispers) Capture all the wounded New Fourth Army soldiers! Zhou Ren Sheng: Yes!]

[Gunfire continues intermittently.]

**Scene 3: The Collaboration**

[Three days after the previous scene. Headquarters of the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army."]

[Curtain opens: Diao De Yi and Zhou Ren Sheng whisper and laugh. Diao De Yi: I think there is no problem. This bandit commander cannot survive between the New Fourth Army and the Japanese. If he wants to eat, drink, and play, he must rely on the Imperial Army. Zhou Ren Sheng: Relying on the Imperial Army, I think this Hu commander has not made up his mind yet. Now this army is still under his command. Diao De Yi: Under his command? It won't be long before it's under my command. Zhou Ren Sheng: You are really clever!]

[Liu Deputy enters. Liu Deputy: Report, the commander is here! Diao De Yi: Please. Liu Deputy: Please, commander. (Leaves.)]

[Hu Chuan Hui enters. Hu Chuan Hui: (singing in Xipi Scattered Plate)]

In turbulent times, heroes rise from all directions,
With a gun, one becomes a grassroots king.
Hooking three sides to roam,
Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese, and the Green and Red gangs.

Diao De Yi: Let me introduce, this is the recently reorganized "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army" commander Hu Chuan Hui, Commander Hu! Commander! This is the translator for Colonel Hei Tian, Mr. Zhou Ren Sheng. Hu Chuan Hui: Good, good, good! Sit, sit, sit! Diao De Yi: Commander, Mr. Zhou brings the Imperial Army's opinion. Hu Chuan Hui: Good, speak! Zhou Ren Sheng: Commander Hu, last time I agreed with the chief of staff that during the sweep, we would jointly encircle and annihilate the New Fourth Army. This time we did not annihilate them, the Imperial Army is very dissatisfied with Commander Hu! Hu Chuan Hui: He is dissatisfied, so what! He, the Japanese, didn't encounter the New Fourth Army, so it should be me who encounters them? Tell you, I won't bang my head against a stone wall with eggs. This army is under my command! Zhou Ren Sheng: This army is under your command, but the Imperial Army will be your commander! Diao De Yi: Commander! Colonel Hei Tian wants to annihilate our army! Fortunately, Mr. Zhou helped in the middle! Hu Chuan Hui: Help! Also can't just use sweet words to please people. This army needs money, guns, and bullets. Diao De Yi: These, we have all prepared. Zhou Ren Sheng: If we agree, the Imperial Army orders you to garrison Sangzhuang. Diao De Yi: Commander, this is a land of fish and rice! Hu Chuan Hui: Old Diao, Sangzhuang is the Communist Party's territory. The New Fourth Army is not easy to deal with! Zhou Ren Sheng: Commander! The Imperial Army is also not easy to deal with! Diao De Yi: Commander! With milk, there is a mother. Relying on the Imperial Army, we will fight them a battle! It all depends on whether you have the guts! Hu Chuan Hui: Good! One word is enough! Zhou Ren Sheng: There is one more small condition! Hu Chuan Hui: You have so many conditions! Zhou Ren Sheng: The New Fourth Army has a batch of wounded soldiers, originally hidden in Sangzhuang. The Imperial Army demands that Commander Hu must capture them. Diao De Yi: No problem, I'll take care of it! Hu Chuan Hui: Since we are fighting the Communist Party together, this is a small matter. Come in!]

[Diao Xiao San and Liu Deputy enter. Diao Xiao San: Yes! Hu Chuan Hui: Pass my order: at three o'clock in the afternoon, the army will march into Sangzhuang. Diao Xiao San: Yes! Diao De Yi: Commander, you are relying on Chiang Kai-shek openly and the Japanese army secretly. You are really resourceful, saving the country in a roundabout way. You can be called a hero of the times! Hu Chuan Hui: Openly or secretly, it's all thanks to you, the chief of staff, for making the connection! This time we have returned to your hometown. You can restore your family business, bring glory to your ancestors, even this strong dragon cannot overcome your local snake! Zhou Ren Sheng: We are the same! (Laughs, and they all leave.)]

**Scene 4: The Struggle**

[The Japanese have "swept" Sangzhuang for three days and have already passed through. Sangzhuang is in a state of devastation after the raid.]

[Curtain opens: Chun Lai Tea House. This is a tea house in a southern town, located at the port entrance, with three small rooms and not many tables. After the Japanese have passed, the tables, chairs, and tea utensils are all damaged, and the outdoor canopy is tilted to one side.]

[Escaped villagers pass by in groups. An old man: A Qing, thank you for taking care of us on the way! A Qing: It's nothing, it's what should be done. Old man: Look, they have ruined it so badly!]

[Another group of villagers enters. Villagers: A Qing! A Qing: You've returned! Villagers: We've returned. Let's all help clean up! A Qing: You sit here for a while. I'll boil some water for you to drink. Village woman: No need, we'll go home first to check. A Qing: Not sitting? Village woman: Not sitting. A Qing: Help your grandfather!]

[The villagers leave. A Qing: (singing in Xipi Shake)]

The enemy swept for three days,
Today they have left the village.
The refugees have all returned to their homes,
I should also row the boat to welcome my relatives.

[A Qing is about to leave when Grandma Sha and Qi Long enter. Grandma Sha: A Qing! A Qing: You've come. Qi Long: A Qing, you've returned. A Qing: I've returned. Qi Long: The Japanese have left. We should bring the wounded comrades out now! A Qing: Right! Let's go!

[Inside, someone shouts: "Hu Chuan Hui's troops are entering the village!"]

[The villagers run past and leave the stage.]

[Wang Fu Gen and a young man enter. Wang Fu Gen: A Qing, Hu Chuan Hui's troops are about to enter the village! A Qing: He's come! The Japanese left, and he followed right after. How did he come so quickly? Have you seen their troops? Wang Fu Gen: I've seen them. There are more than a hundred people! A Qing: More than a hundred? Young man: They are wearing Nationalist Party insignia, and the flag says "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army." A Qing: "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army" ... Nationalist Party insignia ... Wang Fu Gen: I heard Diao De Yi has also returned. Grandma Sha: Diao De Yi is the son of the Diao family patriarch. A Qing: Hmm, you go check again. Young man: I'll go check again. (Leaves.) A Qing: Hu Chuan Hui coming this time, whether he is passing through or staying long, is not clear. The wounded comrades cannot be brought out yet. We must think of a way to send them some dry rations. Wang Fu Gen: I'll prepare fried rice noodles. Qi Long: I'll prepare the boat. A Qing: We must be vigilant! Wang Fu Gen: Yes! (Leaves.) Qi Long: Yes! (Leaves.)]

[A Qing enters the tea house.]

[Inside, someone shouts: "Stop!"]

[The villagers run past and leave the stage.]

[Inside, someone shouts: "Stop!" Diao Xiao San chases a girl carrying a bundle. Diao Xiao San: Stop! Stop. Our army is fighting the Japanese and saving the country. We have driven away the Japanese for you. You should comfort us! Girl: Why are you robbing things? Diao Xiao San: Robbing things, I will even rob people! (Pounces on the girl.) Girl: A Qing!]

[A Qing comes out from the house to stop him. A Qing: Fellow villagers, why bother? Diao Xiao San: What are you doing? Blocking the way?]

[Liu Deputy enters. Liu Deputy: Diao Xiao San, the commander is coming. You are doing what here? A Qing: Liu Deputy! Liu Deputy: A Qing! A Qing: You've returned? Liu Deputy: We've returned. A Qing, it's been a long time. You're doing well? A Qing: Well enough. Liu Deputy: Diao Xiao San, we are all fellow villagers. What are you doing here? A Qing: Yes, this brother is unfamiliar. I haven't seen him before. He is giving me a hard time! Liu Deputy: Diao Xiao San! This is A Qing, who saved the commander's life! You are causing trouble here. The commander knows, you will have a hard time! Ah! Diao Xiao San: I didn't know! A Qing, I, Diao Xiao San, didn't recognize the jade inlaid with gold. You have a magnanimous heart that can hold a ship. Don't take it to heart. A Qing: It's nothing! First-time acquaintance, second-time familiarity. I also won't take advantage of my position to wear small shoes. Liu Deputy, you know! Liu Deputy: A Qing is a kind person! A Qing: (to the girl) Go! Girl: He robbed my bundle! A Qing: The bundle, he wouldn't take your bundle. He was just playing with her, right? Liu Deputy: Ah, playing. You shouldn't choose a place like this?]

[Diao Xiao San hands the bundle to A Qing. A Qing: Take it, go back!]

[The girl leaves. Liu Deputy: Diao Xiao San, go greet the commander and the chief of staff. Go, go! Diao Xiao San: A Qing, see you later. A Qing: Come for tea later.]

[Diao Xiao San leaves. Liu Deputy: A Qing, he is the cousin of our chief of staff. You must be more tolerant! A Qing: That's not a big deal. Liu Deputy, please sit. Later, when the water boils, I'll brew you some tea. You are a rare guest, it's hard to get you to come to my small tea house! Liu Deputy: A Qing, don't bother! I am here on orders to check. The commander will be here soon. A Qing: The commander? Liu Deputy: That's right! Commander Hu! A Qing: Oh! Commander Hu has become a commander? Liu Deputy: Yes! The troops have increased, and the guns have increased! It's completely different from last time. It's prosperous, not the same as before. The bird gun has been replaced with a cannon! A Qing: Oh, that's good! Liu Deputy, it's been a while since you left. Liu Deputy: Some time has passed. A Qing: This time you've returned, you must stay for a while. Liu Deputy: This time we've returned, we won't leave! A Qing: Not leaving? Liu Deputy: We will settle in Sangzhuang. The headquarters will be set up in the chief of staff's house. It has already been cleaned. The commander said: first go to the tea house to sit. (Inside, footsteps.) Liu Deputy: The commander is coming.]

[Hu Chuan Hui and Diao De Yi enter. Hu Chuan Hui: Hey, A Qing! A Qing: Commander Hu! Hu Chuan Hui: How are you? A Qing: Good, good. Which wind blew you back? Hu Chuan Hui: Business is booming. Are you doing well? A Qing: Thanks to you, I'm getting by. Hu Chuan Hui: Good, good. A Qing: Commander Hu, please sit here! Hu Chuan Hui: Come, let me introduce. This is my chief of staff, Diao, the son of the local wealthy Diao family patriarch. A Qing: Chief of staff, I have borrowed your land to make a living. Chief of staff, you have deep roots. In the future, please take care of me. Hu Chuan Hui: Yes, you really need to take care of her. Diao De Yi: Of course, of course. A Qing: Chief of staff, please sit! Hu Chuan Hui: A Qing, where is A Qing? A Qing: He had a little argument with me and left. Hu Chuan Hui: That A Qing is a bit wild, can't stay at home. Where did he go? A Qing: Someone saw him. They said he was running a business in Shanghai. He said, if he doesn't make a name for himself, he won't come back to see me. Hu Chuan Hui: Right, a man should have ambition! A Qing: You are praising him! Hu Chuan Hui: A Qing, I barely escaped death last time, and that's why I have today. I really should thank you! A Qing: That was your own luck. Oh, I was so busy talking that I forgot. You two have been sitting here for so long. I'll go brew some tea. You sit for a while! (Enters the house.) Diao De Yi: Commander! So familiar, who is this? Hu Chuan Hui: You mean her? (singing in Xipi Erliu)]

When I first started my army,
I only had a dozen people and seven or eight guns.
(Changing to Flowing Water)
Encountering the Imperial Army, I was confused and disoriented,
Fortunately, A Qing had me hide in the water jar.
She poured water with a kettle, unruffled,
She fooled the Japanese soldiers, and I came out of the jar.
Such a life-saving favor will never be forgotten,
Hu, I will repay the kindness.

[A Qing walks out from the house.]

Diao De Yi: (looking at A Qing's back, singing in Xipi Flowing Water)

I studied in Japan,
But Sangzhuang is my hometown.
This Chun Lai Tea House has no impression on me,
I have never seen this owner before.

Hu Chuan Hui: (continuing to sing)
Shanghai, the sound of cannons,
She and her husband came to Sangzhuang,
With no relatives or friends to rely on,
She opened a tea house to pass the time.
You studied abroad for many years,
How could you know this owner!

Diao De Yi: This woman is really not simple!
Hu Chuan Hui: What, do you have doubts about her?
Diao De Yi: No! The commander's benefactor!
Hu Chuan Hui: You, this person!
Diao De Yi: Hahaha.

[A Qing enters. A Qing: Chief of staff, the cigarettes are not good. Please have one! Commander Hu, please have one! Diao De Yi: (looking at A Qing's back, singing in Reverse Xipi Shake)]

This woman is unusual,
A Qing: (continuing to sing)
What evil intentions does Diao De Yi have?
Hu Chuan Hui: This little Diao doesn't know how to give face!
A Qing: (continuing to sing)
This rascal is a wall to block the wind.
Diao De Yi: (opening the cigarette box, offering A Qing a cigarette) Smoke.
Hu Chuan Hui: She doesn't know how to, what are you doing!
Diao De Yi: (continuing to sing)
She is neither humble nor arrogant,
A Qing: (continuing to sing)
His expression is neither dark nor bright.
Hu Chuan Hui: (continuing to sing)
What trick is Diao De Yi playing?
A Qing: (continuing to sing)
Are they surnamed Chiang or Wang?
Diao De Yi: (continuing to sing)
I want to probe her indirectly.
A Qing: (continuing to sing)
I must observe her words and expressions to guard against her.
Diao De Yi: A Qing! (singing)
I heard the commander say,
A Qing is really unusual,
I admire your calmness and courage,
Daring to play tricks in front of the Japanese,
If you don't have the thought of resisting Japan and saving the country,
How could you save others without panic!

A Qing: (continuing to sing)
Chief of staff, don't overpraise me,
Saving others is not something I can do.
Opening a tea house, hoping for prosperity,
The first thing in Jianghu is righteousness.
The commander often comes and goes,
I have the heart to lean on a big tree for shade.
It is also the commander's great fortune,
That he could encounter danger and still be auspicious.

Diao De Yi: (continuing to sing)
The New Fourth Army has been in Sangzhuang for a long time,
This big tree provides shade,
You often come and go with them,
Surely you have arranged and taken care of them more carefully.

A Qing: (continuing to sing)
Building a seven-star stove,
Boiling three rivers in a bronze pot,
Setting up an eight-immortal table,
Entertaining sixteen directions.
All who come are guests,
Relying on this mouth,
Meeting and laughing,
After they leave, the tea is cold,
There is no such thing as careful or not careful.

Diao De Yi: A Qing is truly a tea house owner, speaking without revealing anything. Admirable! Admirable! A Qing: Commander, what do you mean? Hu Chuan Hui: He is just that kind of person, strange and eccentric. A Qing, don't take it to heart. A Qing: I don't mind! (Enters the house.) Hu Chuan Hui: Old Diao, A Qing saved my life. We must be polite to her. Why are you hitting her from the east and the west, making me lose face! What are you doing? Diao De Yi: No, commander! This A Qing observes six directions and listens to eight directions, is brave and careful, and does not panic in emergencies. We need to stay in Sangzhuang for a long time, to save the country in a roundabout way. This is a useful person. It's just that I don't know if she is on our side! Hu Chuan Hui: A Qing? She is one of us! Diao De Yi: If you ask her about the New Fourth Army, she won't know. I'm just afraid she knows but won't say. Hu Chuan Hui: If you ask, I will go. You go, and you will definitely get a rebuke. Diao De Yi: That's right, the commander has more face! Hu Chuan Hui: Hahaha.

[A Qing enters. A Qing: Commander Hu, have some melon seeds. This tea has finally gained some flavor! Hu Chuan Hui: Not bad, not bad. The flavor has come out! A Qing, I want to ask you something. A Qing: Anything I know ... Hu Chuan Hui: I ask you about the New Fourth Army ... A Qing: Oh, the New Fourth Army, yes, yes! (singing in Xipi Shake)]

Commander, why bother to inquire,
This place has had many New Fourth Army soldiers.

Hu Chuan Hui: There were New Fourth Army soldiers, were there wounded soldiers? A Qing: (continuing to sing)
There were also many wounded soldiers,
The wounds were heavy and light.

Hu Chuan Hui: Where did they live? A Qing: (continuing to sing)
In this village,
Every family has had many people,
Even in this small tea house,
People often come to drink tea, wash their hands, and rinse their towels.

Hu Chuan Hui: (to Diao De Yi, very pleased) How about that? Diao De Yi: Now? A Qing: (continuing to sing)
After hearing the assembly order,
They left the village in a grand procession!

Hu Chuan Hui: The wounded soldiers also left? A Qing: (continuing to sing)
The wounded soldiers also disappeared,
Far away and hard to find!

Diao De Yi: They all left? A Qing: They all left. If the Japanese "swept" for three days, they combed through Sangzhuang like a comb through hair, and still didn't find them! Diao De Yi: The Japanese, unfamiliar with the area, blind as a bat. Such a large Sangzhuang, hiding a few people, that's easy! Just take Commander Hu, wasn't he hidden by you, A Qing, right under the Japanese noses, into the water jar, and hidden? Hehehe ... A Qing: Oh, from what Diao, the chief of staff, is saying, the New Fourth Army wounded soldiers were hidden by me. This is really listening to the words and hearing the drums. Looking at it this way, Commander Hu, I shouldn't have saved you, otherwise, I would have fallen into trouble! Hu Chuan Hui: A Qing, don't ... A Qing: No, no, no! Commander Hu, in front of you, please let your brothers search this small tea house, inside and out, front and back, to avoid suspicions and ghosts, so we can do things inside and out! Hu Chuan Hui: Old Diao, look at you! Diao De Yi: It's just a joke, why take it seriously! Hu Chuan Hui: Yes, the chief of staff is just joking! A Qing: Commander Hu, we can't afford this joke! (Leaves.) Diao De Yi: (looking at A Qing's back, turning to Hu Chuan Hui) Commander, the New Fourth Army wounded soldiers are nearby, they haven't gone far! Hu Chuan Hui: Where are they? Diao De Yi: (pointing to the reed marsh) They are very likely in the reed marsh across the way! Hu Chuan Hui: The reed marsh? Good, come in!

[Diao Xiao San enters. Hu Chuan Hui: Search the reed marsh for me! Diao De Yi: Wait! Commander, don't search. You are not familiar with the situation in the reed marsh. The reed marsh is vast and complex. If we go in and stumble around, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Besides, we are in the open, and they are in the dark. We might get shot by a sniper. We need to report to the Japanese, but we can't do this losing business! Hu Chuan Hui: Then what do you suggest? Diao De Yi: I'll make them come out on their own! Hu Chuan Hui: Dreaming in broad daylight! They will come out on their own? Diao De Yi: I have my ways. Diao Xiao San, call all the villagers to the Chun Lai Tea House. I have something to say! Diao Xiao San: Yes! (Leaves.) Hu Chuan Hui: Call the villagers for what? Diao De Yi: To have them go to the Yangcheng Lake to catch fish and crabs! Hu Chuan Hui: ... Catch fish and crabs, what's the trick? Diao De Yi: Every boat will have our people on it, all in civilian clothes. When the New Fourth Army sees the villagers going to the lake to catch fish, they will think there is nothing happening in the village and will come out on their own. At that time, all the boats will open fire at once, and ... Hu Chuan Hui: Old Diao, you are really something, hahaha!]

[Inside, the sound of villagers' voices grows louder, and Diao Xiao San enters. Diao Xiao San: The villagers have all come! Diao De Yi: Tell them I have something to say. Diao Xiao San: Hey! The chief of staff has something to say. Diao De Yi: Fellow villagers! We are the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army," an anti-Japanese army. We have come, and we know you are in great difficulty now. We also have nothing to offer to welcome and comfort us. We don't blame you. We want you to go to the Yangcheng Lake to catch fish and crabs, and we will buy them at market prices!]

[Inside, the villagers protest: "We won't go. If we encounter Japanese motorboats, we'll be doomed!" Diao De Yi: Everyone, don't be afraid. Each boat will have three of our brothers to protect you!]

[Inside, the villagers protest: "We won't go! We won't go!" Hu Chuan Hui: Damn it, who dares not go! Whoever doesn't go, will be executed!]

[Diao De Yi, Hu Chuan Hui, and Diao Xiao San leave. A Qing walks out from the house. A Qing: (singing in Xipi Scattered Plate)]

Diao De Yi, a rogue,
Poisonous as a snake, fierce as a wolf,
Setting a trap and spreading a net,
Only fearing that relatives will not be vigilant.
If the fishing boats lift their oars,
Disaster will strike in an instant.

[Inside, the villagers protest, and the pseudo-army suppresses them. A Qing: (continuing to sing)]
If the villagers resist,
They will also shed blood and lose their lives.
I wish I could fly into the reed marsh with wings;
I am so anxious that my body is on fire and I have no plan.

[A pseudo-soldier shouts: "Not going? I'll shoot!" A Qing: Shoot? (singing in Xipi Flowing Water)]

If the village guns fire,
The gunshots will reach the reed marsh,
The relatives will know the situation in the village,
And hide deep in the reeds.
Got it!
Don't be reckless, don't panic,
The wind and the cranes' cries will lure them to shoot. (Throws the teapot into the water and rushes into the house.)

[Diao Xiao San runs up. Diao Xiao San: Oh, someone has jumped into the water.]

[Hu Chuan Hui and Liu Deputy rush up. Hu Chuan Hui: What? Diao Xiao San: Someone has jumped into the water! Hu Chuan Hui: Shoot!]

[Liu Deputy, Diao Xiao San, and Hu Chuan Hui fire a few shots. Diao De Yi hears the sound and rushes up. Diao De Yi: Don't shoot! Ah! Hu Chuan Hui: Why? Diao De Yi: If the New Fourth Army hears the gunshots, will they come out? Hu Chuan Hui: Why didn't you say so earlier! Diao Xiao San! Arrest a few of those who caused trouble! Diao De Yi: Liu Deputy, seize all the boats. I'll starve them to death!]

**Scene 5: Persistence**

[Immediately after the previous scene, in the reed marsh. The sky is dark, and a storm is about to come.]

[Curtain opens: The soldiers and Guo Jian Guang are observing the situation in Sangzhuang.]

[A soldier enters. Soldier: Report, there has been no situation after the gunshots. Guo Jian Guang: Continue to observe the direction of Sangzhuang. Soldier: Yes. (Leaves.) Guo Jian Guang: Comrades, first set up the reed shelter, let the seriously wounded live inside. Tell Ye, I will go to the front to check. Everyone: Yes.]

[Guo Jian Guang leaves. Everyone: What is happening in Sangzhuang with the gunshots? Xiao Li: As soon as the gunshots ring out, it must be the enemy, either the Japanese or the traitors. Xiao Hu: The villagers of Sangzhuang will suffer again. Huo De Rong: If Sangzhuang still has the enemy, we won't be able to leave temporarily. But now, rations and medicine are all gone. This is a big problem!]

[Guo Jian Guang enters. Xiao Hu: Why did we come here? It would have been better to stay in Sangzhuang and fight the enemy! Everyone: Right! Old Platoon Leader: Your thoughts are all reckless. To fight, we must also wait for orders! Isn't it to set up the reed shelter? Come, let's set up the reed shelter first. Everyone: Let's go! (Leaves.) Guo Jian Guang: (singing in Erhuang Introduction)]

Hearing the gunshots across the river shaking the reeds. (singing in Returning Dragon)
These days, there are many situations, careful observation, and guessing,
I can't help but feel my emotions rise and fall like the Yangtze River.
(Changing to Three Eyes)
Looking at Sangzhuang, clouds and fog obscure the view,
Why is there no sail or boat on the lake?
Why hasn't A Qing come to visit?
This sign looks like there is a big story.
The Japanese, Chiang Kai-shek, and Wang Jingwei have been secretly colluding for a long time,
The villages and towns will suffer disasters.
(Changing to Original Plate)
The soldiers want to kill the enemy, risking danger to raid.
One after another, they speak passionately.
Such feelings are not difficult to understand,
Class hatred and national enmity burn in their chests.
We must prevent the spread of impatient emotions,
Encourage the soldiers, observe the overall situation, and wait for instructions,
Stay on guard, hold the gun in hand.
We must remain calm and firm in the reed marsh,
Find medicine and solve the food shortage.
Mobilize the masses to think of a way,
The great river south has natural granaries.
United as one, with hearts towards the Party!
(Calling out)
We will be as firm as a rock and as strong as steel.

[Xiao Hu rushes up. Xiao Hu: Platoon Leader! Xiao Wang has fainted!]

[Lin Da Gen carries Xiao Wang, Ye Si Zhong, Xiao Li, and Xiao Ling enter. Soldiers enter. Everyone: Xiao Wang! Xiao Wang ... Guo Jian Guang: Check his wound to see if it has worsened! Xiao Ling: His wound worsened after getting wet with rainwater, but it's not serious. He is having a fever and chills, and also hungry ... Guo Jian Guang: Have you given him medicine? Xiao Ling: There is no more quinine! Several people with chills have no medicine to take! Guo Jian Guang: How are the seriously wounded? Xiao Ling: Their wounds have worsened after getting wet with rainwater, and the medicine is almost gone! Ye Si Zhong: Platoon Leader, medicine and rations are both problems! Everyone: (whispering) Xiao Wang, Xiao Wang! Guo Jian Guang: We must think of a way! Everyone: Xiao Wang, are you better? Xiao Wang: Comrades, look, I am fine! Soldier: Xiao Wang, I have a rice ball. You eat it. Everyone: Xiao Wang, you eat it. Xiao Wang: Comrades, the platoon leader has saved the rations for the seriously wounded. Platoon Leader, you eat it. Guo Jian Guang: Xiao Wang, comrades, medicine and rations are both problems. I believe the local party will think of a way. The masses will definitely support us. It seems that the Party and the masses are both in difficulty and cannot support us immediately. Then what do we do? Can this army, with the tradition of the old Red Army, be defeated by such a small difficulty? Huo De Rong: No, during the Long March, the old Red Army climbed snowy mountains and crossed grasslands, overcoming such difficulties. We will definitely persist! Everyone: Right! Guo Jian Guang: Right!

[Motorboat sounds. A soldier enters. Soldier: Report! A motorboat is discovered on the lake! Guo Jian Guang: Continue to observe!]

[A soldier leaves. Guo Jian Guang: Ye, take two comrades to the front for reconnaissance!]

[Ye Si Zhong, Zhang Song Tao, and Xiao Hu leave. Guo Jian Guang: You two go take care of the seriously wounded.]

[The soldier and Xiao Ling leave. Guo Jian Guang: Comrades! Prepare for battle!]

[Everyone watches the direction of the motorboat sounds. The motorboat sounds gradually weaken.]

[Ye Si Zhong, Zhang Song Tao, and Xiao Hu enter. The soldier and Xiao Ling enter later. Ye Si Zhong: Platoon Leader, the motorboat went to Sangzhuang. Guo Jian Guang: Based on the situation, the Japanese have retreated. Just now, Sangzhuang fired a few shots, and now a motorboat is discovered on the lake? Ye Si Zhong: Only the Japanese have motorboats. Guo Jian Guang: I think we should send two people across the lake to reconnoiter. Everyone: I'll go! I'll go! Guo Jian Guang: Lin Da Gen, Zhang Song Tao, you two go across the lake. Don't go find A Qing. Her situation must be very difficult. After understanding the enemy situation, casually find some herbs from the villagers and return immediately!

(singing in Xipi Erliu)
You two disguise yourselves and row the boat to the other shore,
Hide the boat under the tree at the village's west side.
Find some herbs to treat the wounded,
Clarify the enemy situation and return.
The comrades are full of confidence waiting for you,
Waiting for the return of the reconnaissance soldiers.
Grasp the enemy situation to make judgments,
We will have the initiative,
Coming and going will be convenient,
We can cleverly deal with the enemy.
After recovering, we will request to fight,
Return to the front and annihilate the enemy.
The war drums will shock the sky, and the red flags will be displayed,
We will quickly recover the great south of the river.

Lin Da Gen: Zhang Song Tao: We will definitely complete the mission. Guo Jian Guang: Prepare to go!]

[Lin Da Gen and Zhang Song Tao leave.]

[Old Platoon Leader runs up. Old Platoon Leader: Platoon Leader! Platoon Leader, look, these reed roots can be eaten! Guo Jian Guang: Reed roots can be eaten! With reed roots, we can continue to persist in the reed marsh. Chairman Mao taught us: “Often there is such a situation, favorable conditions and the initiative of recovery are produced in the effort of 'persisting a little longer.'” Comrades!

(singing in Xipi Scattered Plate)
Difficulties cannot scare heroes,
The wisdom of the masses is as vast as the sky.
Eating reed roots is fragrant and sweet,
Persist in the struggle, victory is in the next day.
Comrades! This reed marsh is the front line, the battlefield. We must persist here and wait for the superior's orders! Everyone: Right! We will wait for orders, not fear difficulties, and persist until victory!

[A storm suddenly rises. Xiao Hu: The storm is coming! Guo Jian Guang: (singing in Xipi Reverse Plate)]

We must learn from the pine on the top of Mount Tai!
Everyone: (singing together) We must learn from the pine on the top of Mount Tai,
Standing tall and proud under the sky.
Eight thousand miles of storms cannot blow it down,
Nine thousand thunderbolts cannot crush it.
Fierce sun and scorching heat cannot kill it,
Severe cold and frost make it lush and green.
The pine tree, facing disasters and trials, after grinding and testing,
With wounds and scars, it is stronger,
Like iron branches and copper trunk,
Vigorous and robust, strong and unyielding.
Noble character is praised by all,
We, eighteen wounded soldiers,
Will become eighteen pines!

**Scene 6: The Strategy**

[Shortly after the previous scene. Chun Lai Tea House.]

[A storm has just passed, and the sky is filled with dark clouds. The air is oppressive, and the pressure is low. There is no one under the canopy outside the tea house. Inside, the sound of playing mahjong and shuffling cards can be heard from time to time.]

[A Qing enters.]

[A young man enters. Young man: A Qing, you called for me? A Qing: Have Qi Long and A Xiang returned? Young man: I haven't seen them. A Qing: If they return, tell them to come here. Young man: Yes. (Leaves.)]

[Liu Deputy enters. A Qing: Liu Deputy. Liu Deputy: A Qing, is the chief of staff inside? A Qing: He is inside playing cards. Do you have something? Liu Deputy: Yes. A Qing: What is it? ...]

[Liu Deputy does not answer and walks straight into the house. A Qing alertly follows him inside.]

[Diao De Yi and Liu Deputy walk out from the house. Diao De Yi: What's the matter? Liu Deputy: Mr. Zhou, the translator, has come, saying it's urgent, looking for you. Diao De Yi: Oh! Liu Deputy: The Imperial Army called, asking if the New Fourth Army wounded soldiers have been found. Diao De Yi: The Japanese are really pressing! We captured poor villagers, and they don't know anything. Where am I supposed to find them? Liu Deputy: That Wang Fu Gen ... Diao De Yi: Wang Fu Gen? Liu Deputy: The one who led the trouble the other day! Diao De Yi: Right, we should focus on him. Liu Deputy: You should go quickly! The motorboats are all ready, and Mr. Zhou, the translator, is about to leave. Diao De Yi: I'll go see. Hey, you stay here. I'll be back soon. Liu Deputy: Chief of staff, I think it's better to stay out of sight. These days, the commander has been scolding me a lot. Today, my luck is bad. Later, he might scold me again ... Diao De Yi: The commander scolding you is not directed at you! I have it figured out. I'm here. Go inside and serve! Liu Deputy: Yes, I listen to the chief of staff.]

[Diao De Yi leaves, and Liu Deputy enters the house. A Qing: (walking out from the house, looking at the sky and water, worried) Diao De Yi is coming and going. Commander Hu is inside playing cards. I can't go out. I can't leave. Qi Long and A Xiang are delivering rations to the comrades, and they haven't returned yet. The comrades have been in the reed marsh for five days. What can I do to save my relatives from danger!

(singing in Erhuang Slow Plate)
The wind is tight, the rain is heavy, the sky is low, and the clouds are dark,
I can't help but feel restless and anxious.
My relatives are short of rations, out of medicine, and the news is cut off,
How can they endure the waves and floods in the reed marsh?
(Changing to Fast Three Eyes)
They are precious revolutionary assets,
Eighteen people are all connected to me like flesh and blood.
The liaison officer is burdened with a thousand-pound responsibility,
Comrade Chen instructed me repeatedly before leaving.
How can I be helpless in danger,
Betraying the Party's cultivation of me for many years.
Last night, I sent Qi Long and A Xiang to deliver rice and flour,
Why haven't they returned yet.
I should go see my relatives,
But alas, I can't escape, there are hounds,
Diao De Yi has set up sentries and seized the boats.
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The situation is difficult.
Party!
Give me wisdom, give me courage,
Help me overcome the enemy and pass the difficulty.

[Grandma Sha and Qi Long enter. Grandma Sha: A Qing. A Qing: Did you deliver the rations? Qi Long: No, last night, A Xiang and I just rowed the boat out, and we were discovered by the enemy. We jumped into the water and escaped. They seized the boat. A Qing: Where is A Xiang? Qi Long: He caught a cold and is sweating at home! Grandma Sha: A Qing, what should we do? A Qing: We must think of a way to get a boat and send them some rations! Qi Long: If not, tonight, I'll steal one. A Qing: Liu Deputy has come. Tell Qi Long to pretend to be sick. When he comes, borrow a boat from him, saying you are taking Qi Long to the city to see a doctor.]

[Liu Deputy walks out from the house, and Qi Long pretends to be sick on the table. A Qing: Liu Deputy. Liu Deputy: A Qing. (Sees Qi Long) Hey, who is this? A Qing: It's Grandma Sha's son. Liu Deputy: What is he doing here? A Qing: He is sick. Grandma Sha: Liu Deputy, the child is sick. We want to borrow a boat from you to take the child to the city to see a doctor. Liu Deputy: What, borrow a boat? That won't do! Grandma Sha: A Qing, please ask for a favor. A Qing: Yes, Liu Deputy, the child is so sick. We have no doctor here. Please do us a favor! Liu Deputy: A Qing, I can't make that decision. The boats are all over there, but not one can be moved. That's the chief of staff's order. A Qing, you should stay out of this business and avoid trouble. A Qing: Sigh, the child is so pitiful! Liu Deputy: Ah ah ...]

[Inside, the sound of a bell. A pseudo-soldier shouts: "Stop! Who are you?" Chen Tianmin: (inside) I am the doctor! Grandma Sha: Oh! The doctor has come! A Qing: That's good. Call the doctor not to leave. Liu Deputy, let this doctor examine the child! Liu Deputy: No, no! A Qing: Yes, yes! Grandma Sha: Liu Deputy, since you won't lend the boat, please let the doctor examine the child. Liu Deputy: Grandma Sha, no, no! A Qing: Yes, Liu Deputy, since the doctor has come, we really should let him go. Let the doctor examine the child. Liu Deputy: A Qing, you know, I can't explain to the chief of staff. The chief of staff said this place is not for outsiders. A Qing: This is nothing big. Not to mention the chief of staff, even the commander, this favor, he would give. Liu Deputy: Then go tell him. A Qing: For such a small matter, don't bother him. Liu Deputy: Then I can't make that decision!]

[Hu Chuan Hui enters. Hu Chuan Hui: What's the matter? Liu Deputy: Ah, commander! A doctor has come. A Qing said to let this doctor examine the child. Hu Chuan Hui: Examine the child? A Qing: Oh! It's like this: the child is sick, just as the doctor happened to pass by. I just added a word, let the doctor examine the child. Liu Deputy said, Commander Hu would give this favor, but he was afraid the chief of staff would know and make you difficult. He said that, and I dared not ask you! Hu Chuan Hui: The chief of staff's fart is fragrant. Treating a chicken feather as an order! A Qing: Actually, it's not Liu Deputy's business. Liu Deputy also said, the commander is kind-hearted and generous. I was afraid that if the chief of staff really insisted, I felt bad for the commander. So, let the doctor ... Hu Chuan Hui: Examine! Liu Deputy: Bring the doctor in! A Qing: Then I'll thank the commander on behalf of the child! Grandma Sha: Doctor. (Chen Tianmin enters.) Chen Tianmin: You're all well? Grandma Sha: Well. Please come over to examine the pulse. Chen Tianmin: Good! (Examines Qi Long's pulse.) A Qing: Commander Hu, how is your luck today? Hu Chuan Hui: Terrible, four rounds without a win. I came out to take a breath. A Qing: Your luck will come back this time. I guarantee you will win three full hands! Hu Chuan Hui: With your good words, I'll win a full hand, and I'll treat you! A Qing: Then you've promised the guest. Hurry up and go in. They are all waiting for you to deal the cards! Hu Chuan Hui: Good, good, good. (Enters the house.) Liu Deputy: Where are you from? Chen Tianmin: Changshu City, a third-generation hereditary doctor. Liu Deputy: Do you have a resident certificate? Chen Tianmin: Yes. Liu Deputy: Show it.]

[Chen Tianmin takes out the resident certificate and hands it to Liu Deputy. A Qing: (taking over two cups of tea) Liu Deputy, you've been so busy these days. The area along the lake has all been guarded, and the boats have been seized. The villagers are not allowed to go to the lake to catch fish. What happened? Liu Deputy: Nothing, nothing. I heard there are New Fourth Army soldiers in the reed marsh. The chief of staff wants ... (gestures, indicating to capture.) A Qing: New Fourth Army? Then why don't you send troops to search? Liu Deputy: The chief of staff said, the reed marsh is very large. Where do we search? We won't talk about this. (turns to Chen Tianmin) Hurry up and examine the patient. Hurry up. A Qing: Doctor, the child's illness ... Chen Tianmin: The patient doesn't need to speak, and I know the root of the illness. That's right, eat my medicine. If it's not right, I won't take a penny. Liu Deputy: Hey hey hey, you first don't boast. Today, I want to see how skilled you are! Chen Tianmin: This illness is a blockage in the middle burner, causing difficulty in breathing. Liu Deputy: Wait. (to Grandma Sha) Is he right? Grandma Sha: He just said his chest was stuffy! Liu Deputy: Oh, he has some skills! Chen Tianmin: Look at the tongue coating. (Qi Long sticks out his tongue.) The stomach has fire, and the diet is not regular. Grandma Sha: Yes, lack of food. Chen Tianmin: The liver is depressed and uncomfortable, making it easy to be impatient. Grandma Sha: Worried! Liu Deputy: Hey! Headache and fever, what's the hurry? Chen Tianmin: It's not serious, I'll prescribe a medicine, and it will be fine after taking one dose!

[Liu Deputy watches Chen Tianmin, A Qing, and Grandma Sha anxiously. A Qing thinks for a moment and walks into the house. Chen Tianmin: (singing in Erhuang Shake)]

The illness is not serious, don't worry,
A calm heart naturally has fewer worries.
Someone at home takes good care ...

[A Qing walks out. A Qing: Liu Deputy, what are you looking at? Liu Deputy: Where, where, I am interested in medicine. Chen Tianmin: (continuing to sing) One dose of herbs will keep you safe. Liu Deputy: Give it! (takes the prescription.) Chen Tianmin: Please.

[A pseudo-soldier enters. Pseudo-soldier: Liu Deputy, the commander is calling you. Liu Deputy: A Qing, you keep an eye on things. I'll be right back. A Qing: Okay.]

[Liu Deputy enters the house, and A Qing quickly instructs Qi Long and Grandma Sha to pay attention to the enemy's movements. Chen Tianmin and A Qing talk in low voices. A Qing: Comrade Chen, many villagers have been captured. Chen Tianmin: Oh! According to our intelligence, Hu Chuan Hui has completely surrendered to the Japanese. A Qing: Then what should we do? Chen Tianmin: We must remove this thorn. Our main forces will arrive soon! A Qing: Good. Chen Tianmin: You investigate the enemy's troop deployment. In a few days, I will send someone to take the intelligence. A Qing: What about the wounded comrades? Chen Tianmin: Transfer immediately to Hongshi Village. A Qing: Yes.]

[Qi Long coughs. Liu Deputy enters. Liu Deputy: A Qing, the commander has won money. He said you called him to treat you. Tell me to buy things. (to Chen Tianmin) Hey, why haven't you left yet? Grandma Sha: Doctor, this is a small token of appreciation. (gives money to Chen Tianmin, who does not take it.) Chen Tianmin: I'll leave now. The medicine should be taken early and not past tonight. Liu Deputy: Hurry up, hurry up. Chen Tianmin: I'll leave now. Grandma Sha: Doctor, the sky is dark, and the road is bumpy. Be careful. A Qing: Yes, watch your step. Chen Tianmin: Don't worry, take care of the patient. Liu Deputy: Hurry up, hurry up!]

[Chen Tianmin and Liu Deputy leave. A Qing: The county committee has instructions to transfer the comrades to Hongshi Village. We still need to think of a way to get a boat. Qi Long: I have an idea. Grandma Sha: What is your idea? Qi Long: I'll jump into the water, cut the rope, and secretly push out a boat. I won't use an oar or a paddle. The boat will have no one on it, and the noise will be small. As long as I push it half a mile, in the vast lake, the smoke and fog will be thick, and nothing will be visible. The situation is such that this is the only way. Grandma Sha: A Qing, he has good water skills. Let him go. A Qing: The situation is such that only he can go. Qi Long, follow that small path to find a secluded place to enter the water. Be careful!

(singing in Xipi Scattered Plate)
Cutting the rope and pushing the boat requires caution,
Be wary of enemies on the shore.
The boat should move quickly across the lake heart.

Qi Long: Good, A Qing, Mom, I'm leaving!

[Qi Long and Grandma Sha leave. A Fu enters. A Fu: A Qing, last night, Platoon Leader Guo sent Lin Da Gen and Zhang Song Tao to my house. A Qing: What did they come for? A Fu: They investigated Hu Chuan Hui's situation, got some herbs, and left. A Qing: Didn't you give them some rations? A Fu: I did. They took them all. A Qing: Good, you go back first. A Fu: Yes. (Leaves.) A Qing: (continuing to sing) The comrades will definitely transfer to Hongshi Village.

[A Qing leaves, and Liu Deputy chases after her. Liu Deputy: A Qing, the things are bought. (Enters the house.)]

[Diao De Yi and Diao Xiao San enter from another direction. Liu Deputy walks out from the house. Liu Deputy: Chief of staff, has Mr. Zhou, the translator, left? Diao De Yi: He has left. Commander Hu is getting married. Liu Deputy: Married, who is the bride? Diao De Yi: Mr. Zhou's sister. Liu Deputy: No doubt, you are the chief of staff's great matchmaker. Diao De Yi: Liu Deputy, in a few days, I have a beautiful task for you. Liu Deputy: Chief of staff, what is it? Diao De Yi: (smiling) To Changshu City to buy some wedding gifts. Liu Deputy: Yes, yes. I thank the chief of staff.]

[Diao De Yi walks to the high slope by the lake and observes the lake with binoculars. Diao De Yi: Hey! There seems to be a boat on the water. Liu Deputy: A boat! After a day of strong wind, it might have broken the rope and floated out. Diao De Yi: No! An empty boat with a broken rope can only drift with the wind and water. How can it go against the wind and water? There must be someone under the boat. Liu Deputy: Someone? Diao De Yi: Come, chase this boat! Liu Deputy: Yes.]

---

**Scene 7: Rebuke**

[Not long after the previous scene. The hall of Diao De Yi's house.]

[Curtain opens: Inside, the sound of pseudo-soldiers torturing: "Speak up, speak up!"]

[Hu Chuan Hui drinks wine anxiously, and Diao De Yi paces back and forth anxiously. Diao De Yi: (reciting) The New Fourth Army has safely transferred out of the reed marsh, Hu Chuan Hui: (reciting) The Japanese are pressing and demanding, what can we do to deceive them?]

[Inside, the sound of torture and interrogation. Diao De Yi: (reciting) We captured poor villagers,
Torturing them to find out who is the Communist Party,
Hu Chuan Hui: (reciting) Asked for half a day,
Still didn't get any information!
Has anyone confessed? Diao Xiao San: (inside) No. Hu Chuan Hui: I say, Old Diao, we won't execute a few of them? Diao De Yi: I am thinking about who to start with. Come in, bring in Wang Fu Gen! Diao Xiao San: (inside) Yes.]

[Diao Xiao San and Liu Deputy escort Wang Fu Gen onto the stage. Hu Chuan Hui: Speak, where did the New Fourth Army wounded soldiers go? Diao De Yi: As long as you speak, who in the village is a Communist Party member, you will be released immediately. Wang Fu Gen: You traitors riding on the heads of the people! Hu Chuan Hui: Come in! In front of those poor villagers, execute him. Wang Fu Gen: Traitor! Diao Xiao San: Go. (Escorts Wang Fu Gen off the stage.)]

[Wang Fu Gen shouts inside: "Down with the traitors!" "Down with Japanese imperialism!" Gunshots. Diao De Yi: Diao Xiao San, bring in the family member of the New Fourth Army, Old Liu! Diao Xiao San: (inside) Yes.]

[Inside, Old Liu shouts: "Down with the traitors and sellouts!" "Down with Japanese imperialism!" Gunshots. Hu Chuan Hui: Come in!]

[Diao Xiao San enters. Hu Chuan Hui: Bring in that old woman from the Sha family! Diao De Yi: Wait! Bring them all in. Diao Xiao San: Yes. (Leaves.) Diao De Yi: Commander, that old woman from the Sha family cannot be executed. The Imperial Army has specifically asked for her confession, not her life, to question the Communists behind the scenes! Hu Chuan Hui: Communists? I'm afraid the Communists are sitting across from us, and we can't recognize them! Diao De Yi: Commander, there is one person who is very suspicious. Hu Chuan Hui: Who? Diao De Yi: The other day, Liu Deputy carelessly fired a few shots. Where was that? The seized boat was missing one. Where was that? Hu Chuan Hui: Huh? Diao De Yi: Both are not far from Chun Lai Tea House! Hu Chuan Hui: You mean ... Diao De Yi: A Qing! Hu Chuan Hui: Her? Diao De Yi: Very suspicious. Hu Chuan Hui: Then, according to you, what should we do, arrest her? Diao De Yi: No, no! The commander's benefactor! We invite her to come and ask. Hu Chuan Hui: Ask? How to ask? — "Are you a Communist Party member?" Diao De Yi: How can we ask like that! We invite A Qing, and say ... (whispers) How to do? Hu Chuan Hui: Good, listen to you!]

[A pseudo-soldier enters. Pseudo-soldier: Report, A Qing has arrived! Diao De Yi: Please! (Leaves with Hu Chuan Hui.)]

[A Qing enters. A Qing: (singing in Xipi Shake)]

The New Fourth Army counter-sweeps and advances east,
Sangzhuang will soon see the light of day.
Hu Chuan Hui has surrendered to the enemy, trampling on the villagers,
This blood debt must be remembered.
Following the instructions to investigate the enemy, it is almost certain,
Only the headquarters has not been investigated,
Using an excuse to enter the tiger's den to observe the situation —

[Hu Chuan Hui and Diao De Yi enter. A Qing: Commander Hu! Chief of staff! Hu Chuan Hui: A Qing! A Qing: (continuing to sing) Congratulations on the commander's marriage! Hu Chuan Hui: You know everything? Diao De Yi: Truly well-informed! A Qing: The whole village knows. Liu Deputy has already notified each household to send gifts voluntarily. Diao De Yi: Good, sit, sit, sit, brew tea! A Qing: Commander, I heard the bride is very beautiful? Hu Chuan Hui: Oh! You've heard? A Qing: I've heard! A famous beauty from Changshu City, outstanding character, exceptional talent, truly one in a hundred! Hu Chuan Hui: Hahaha! A Qing, you really know how to talk. Today I invited you to help with the wedding. On that day, you must help out! A Qing: It's nothing, it's what should be done. When the time comes, I'll come early, what to do with tea and water ... Hu Chuan Hui: No! Those chores, how can I let you do them? Just wait for the bridal sedan to enter the door, you take care of it, so there won't be any mistakes. A Qing: Alright, alright, when the bridal sedan enters the door, you can leave it to me. I'll make sure all the necessary greetings are done, and the relatives and friends won't find any fault. Commander, you can rest assured. Hu Chuan Hui: That's great. They have many relatives, and they like to find fault. With you in charge, I can rest assured. A Qing: Where is the bridal chamber? Hu Chuan Hui: It's in the back courtyard. Tomorrow, when everything is ready, I will definitely send someone to invite you. A Qing: Good, I will definitely come! Diao De Yi: (striking the cigarette ash on the table, asking sternly) Has that old woman from the Sha family confessed? Diao Xiao San: (inside) She won't confess! Diao De Yi: Bring her in! A Qing: Commander, you have business here. I'm not convenient to stay. I'll leave. Diao De Yi: A Qing, we do our thing, and you sit your thing! Hu Chuan Hui: Hey! Since the chief of staff asked you to stay, you sit for a while! A Qing: Then I'll sit for a while. Diao De Yi: Bring her in! Grandma Sha: (inside, singing in Xipi Reverse Plate)]

Fortunately, the relatives have escaped danger,
(In the singing, she is escorted onto the stage by Diao Xiao San and Liu Deputy.)
(continuing to sing in Xipi Scattered Plate)
Even if I die, I am willing.
Standing up to see the enemy —
(Sees A Qing sitting on the side, startled)
(continuing to sing) A Qing is here at the hall?
(Thinks for a moment, as if enlightened.)
(continuing to sing) I'm afraid the enemy is trying to test,
I must protect her,
Take on the great task alone!

Hu Chuan Hui: Old woman Sha, will you confess or not? Grandma Sha: What do you want me to confess? Hu Chuan Hui: Did the New Fourth Army in the reed marsh leave with your son Qi Long? Grandma Sha: I don't know! Hu Chuan Hui: Then where did your son go? Grandma Sha: I don't know! Hu Chuan Hui: Who was the mastermind behind your son's actions? Who gave the order? Grandma Sha: I don't know! Hu Chuan Hui: Damn it, knowing nothing, today I'll let you taste my power!

[Hu Chuan Hui is about to hit Grandma Sha, and Diao De Yi quickly stops him. Diao De Yi: Commander, why rush? Sit down, sit down. Old woman, you've suffered. Come, come, let me talk to you! (singing in Xipi Shake)]

Old woman Sha, don't be so upset,
Let me make things clear to you:
You are old and have lived in the village,
How could you plan and arrange things cleverly?
Surely someone came to order you,
She is behind the scenes, and you are on stage.
Now you suffer torture and cannot endure,
She watches from the sidelines, sitting on the fishing platform.
As long as you tell her name and surname,
Diao De Yi will ensure you will never lack rice and firewood!

Diao Xiao San: Old woman, think it over carefully! Diao De Yi: How about it, have you thought it over?

[Grandma Sha is silent. Diao De Yi: A Qing, you persuade her a few words! A Qing: Me? Diao De Yi: You are neighbors, persuade her a few words! Ah? Hu Chuan Hui: Yes, A Qing, you go persuade her a few words. A Qing: Alright, since the chief of staff thinks highly of me, I'll try. But this old woman's temper, I know, I'm afraid I'll get a rebuke. (walks to Grandma Sha) Grandma Sha, your son sent a boat to the New Fourth Army. Is that true?]

[Grandma Sha glares at the three men without speaking. A Qing: Grandma Sha, you only have this one son. Would you let him go? Grandma Sha: The child is grown up, and he chooses his own path! Hu Chuan Hui: Say, what benefits did the New Fourth Army give you? Grandma Sha: Good! I'll say! I'll say! (singing in Erhuang Original Plate)]

On August 13,
The enemy fought in Shanghai,
The land of Jiangnan was lost,
Bodies piled up, blood flowing,
Everywhere was desolation, fire everywhere.
The New Fourth Army, the Communist Party, came to resist the enemy,
Enduring hardships, advancing to Jiangnan, deep into the enemy's rear,
Liberating towns and villages.
Where the red flag is raised, songs ring out,
The people finally see the light of day,
You call yourselves the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army,"
Why don't you fire a shot at the Japanese?
I ask you, which country are you saving?
Why don't you save China and help the East Asians?
Why do you only attack the Communist Party?
Where is your loyalty? Where is your righteousness?
You are traitors, sellouts, and scoundrels,
Without shame, losing all humanity!

Hu Chuan Hui: Stop! Grandma Sha: (continuing to sing)
You have reason, dare to speak in front of the people,
Even if you cut me into a thousand pieces, it doesn't matter!
Sangzhuang will be liberated one day,
Let's see how these traitors and sellouts end up!

Hu Chuan Hui: Drag her out and execute her!

[Diao Xiao San and Liu Deputy escort Grandma Sha off the stage. A Qing: Commander Hu! Diao De Yi: Wait! A Qing has something to say! A Qing: (lightly) ... I should leave now!

[Diao De Yi and Hu Chuan Hui look dejected. A Qing: This is your business. We dare not interfere. Hu Chuan Hui: No, no, today we must listen to your advice! Diao De Yi: The commander wants to execute Old Woman Sha. You are neighbors. Can you see her die? A Qing: Grandma Sha will have someone to save her. Hu Chuan Hui: Who? A Qing: Her son Qi Long, who sent a boat to the New Fourth Army. Won't he save his mother? Besides, the New Fourth Army will definitely save Grandma Sha! Hu Chuan Hui: I'll execute her immediately, and see who saves her! A Qing: Yes, if you execute Grandma Sha, no one will come. No one will come to save Grandma Sha. You won't catch anyone! Hu Chuan Hui: Oh! You mean to set a trap and catch a big fish, to lure them in? Diao De Yi: According to you, it's better not to execute Old Woman Sha? A Qing: The gun is in your hand. The big decision is yours. I'm just thinking for the commander! Hu Chuan Hui: Yes, yes, yes! Diao De Yi: Good, A Qing is really one of us. This is what we do, we plan to release Old Woman Sha immediately. Please escort her back. How is that? A Qing: The chief of staff trusts me so much. I will definitely do as you say. Diao De Yi: Good, come in! Escort Old Woman Sha out.]

[Liu Deputy escorts Grandma Sha onto the stage. Grandma Sha: Kill me if you want. Don't play tricks! Hu Chuan Hui: Old Woman Sha, we are releasing you. Don't be ungrateful! Diao De Yi: Old Woman Sha, you have no business here. A Qing, escort her back. A Qing: Grandma Sha, let's go!]

[Grandma Sha leaves, and A Qing follows her off the stage. Diao De Yi: (to Liu Deputy) You follow them and see what they say. Liu Deputy: Yes. (Leaves.) Hu Chuan Hui: Old Diao, what kind of trick are you playing? Diao De Yi: As long as they talk warmly, it proves they are together. Capture them immediately and interrogate them together!]

[Liu Deputy enters. Liu Deputy: Report! Chief of staff, they are fighting! Hu Chuan Hui: Who is fighting with whom? Liu Deputy: Old Woman Sha is fighting with A Qing! Hu Chuan Hui: Capture Old Woman Sha! Liu Deputy: Yes. (Leaves.)]

[A Qing enters. A Qing: Such a fierce old woman! She started fighting with me as soon as she left the door, cursing "traitor" and "dog" non-stop. Oh! Look! Her clothes are torn, and her teeth are bleeding! Look! Hu Chuan Hui: Old Diao! Don't be so clever. You see, this is how it is! A Qing, are you alright? My wedding ... A Qing: The wedding can go on. Hmph, blind eyes, she wanted to scheme against me. That old woman is no match for me. I've already beaten her to a pulp! Diao De Yi: A Qing, you are overthinking it. A Qing: Hmph! If I were overthinking it, I wouldn't interfere with others in front of those who overthink. Hu Chuan Hui: (pointing to Diao De Yi) Nervous breakdown!]

**Scene 8: Raid**

[Three days later, before dawn. Wilds.]

[Curtain opens: Zhang Song Tao and Ye Si Zhong enter, patrol, and leave. Guo Jian Guang: (inside, singing in Xipi Reverse Plate)]

The moon shines on the journey, and the breeze is refreshing ...

[Soldiers and Guo Jian Guang enter. Guo Jian Guang: (singing in Original Plate)]

We have passed through mountains and rivers, and the sleeping villages.
The detachment has laid a net of encirclement,
To annihilate the traitorous gang of Hu Chuan Hui.
A rapid assault team has been formed to advance quickly,
(Changing to Fast Plate)
Launching a surprise attack on Sangzhuang.
Striking directly at the enemy's heart,
Catching them off guard.
Making them collapse in chaos, losing their way,
Like ants in a boiling pot, bees in a burning hive!

[Zhang Song Tao and Ye Si Zhong enter. Ye Si Zhong: Enemy patrol! Qi Long: Kill them! Guo Jian Guang: Hide!]

[Everyone hides.]

[The pseudo-soldier patrol passes by. Guo Jian Guang: Ye, Zhang Song Tao! Zhang Song Tao: Yes! Ye Si Zhong: Yes! Guo Jian Guang: Look: Sangzhuang is in sight. Command you two to continue reconnaissance! Advance! Zhang Song Tao: Ye Si Zhong: Yes. (Leave.) Guo Jian Guang: (singing in Xipi Fast Plate)]

What is the sealed line and the sentry posts?
I see that Sangzhuang is in sight,
(Changing to Xipi Scattered Plate)
This time, we will raid the enemy's nest and capture the king. (Leave.)

**Scene 9: Breakthrough**

[Immediately after the previous scene, outside the back wall of the headquarters of the "Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army."]

[Curtain opens, pseudo-soldier sentry. A pseudo-soldier is on duty. Pseudo-soldier: The commander is getting married, inviting the Japanese, ordering us to increase the guard. Sigh! Bad luck.]

[Ye Si Zhong and others enter, capturing the pseudo-soldier.]

[Guo Jian Guang leads the assault team soldiers, and A Qing leads the militia. A Qing: Platoon Leader, over this wall is the back courtyard of Diao De Yi! (singing in Xipi Fast Plate)]

The enemy deployment has not changed,
The intelligence sent is clear at a glance.
The main force is on the east and west sides,
There is only one class in front of the gate.

The militia cuts the telephone line,
The two wings cannot come to support.
Inside, the wedding banquet is being held,
They are drinking, gambling, and making a ruckus.
You jump over the wall and rush to the courtyard,
You can definitely annihilate the group of villains in one go.

Guo Jian Guang: Qi Long, (continuing to sing)
You lead the firepower team to the front courtyard,
Annihilate the enemy's guard class.
(to A Qing)
You welcome the main force to the village edge.

[Qi Long leads the soldiers, and A Qing leads the militia off the stage.]

[Guo Jian Guang leads the soldiers over the wall and leaves.]

**Scene 10: Annihilation**

[The front courtyard of Diao De Yi's house.]

[Curtain opens: Zhou Ren Sheng, Diao De Yi, Hei Tian, Hu Chuan Hui, etc. enter. Zhou Ren Sheng: Diao Xiao San, is everything ready? Diao Xiao San: The motorboat is ready. Hei Tian: The telephone is not working, the situation is bad. You must be careful, open the way, open the way! (Leaves.)]

[Cannon fire. Hu Chuan Hui: Where is the cannon fire? Diao De Yi: I don't know!]

[A pseudo-soldier enters. Pseudo-soldier: Report! The New Fourth Army has already attacked the back courtyard! Hu Chuan Hui: Hold on! Hold on! (Panic and escape off the stage.)]

[The battle begins, and the assault team annihilates Hu Chuan Hui's troops.]

[The main force of the detachment, Chen Tianmin, and others escort Hei Tian and Zhou Ren Sheng. Guo Jian Guang and the soldiers escort Hu Chuan Hui and Diao De Yi onto the stage.]

[A Qing, the people of Sangzhuang, and the villagers rescued from prison carry handcuffs onto the stage. Seeing Hu Chuan Hui and Diao De Yi, they are furious, raising the handcuffs to hit, but are stopped by A Qing. Guo Jian Guang: Fellow villagers! Hand these traitors to the people's anti-Japanese democratic government for public trial! A Qing: Fellow villagers! We must publicly try them. Hu Chuan Hui: You are? A Qing: I am a member of the Communist Party of China! Guo Jian Guang: Take them away!]

[The soldiers escort Hu Chuan Hui, Diao De Yi, Hei Tian, and Zhou Ren Sheng off the stage.]

[Grandma Sha enters, meeting with Chen Tianmin, Guo Jian Guang, Qi Long, and others. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Sangzhuang will see the light of day from now on.]

      第二场　转　移
          〔幕启：沙奶奶家门前，左边有棵柳树，右边是沙奶奶的住房。场上摆有竹制桌椅。
          〔沙奶奶正在缝补衣裳。小凌整理绷带、药品。小王在折麻袋。小　凌：小王！来换药！小　王：我不换。小　凌：为什么？小　王：小凌！咱们药品这么困难，应该先尽重伤员用，我这伤很快就会好的。小　凌：药是不多了，可是咱们的流动医院就要给咱们送药品来。你的伤不算重，可也不算轻。小　王：我是轻伤号。小　凌：轻伤？那指导员带轻伤员帮助老乡收稻子，为什么没有你呀？
          〔小王语塞。小　凌：小王，来换药吧！小　王：我就是不换！小　凌：指导员叫我给你换药！沙奶奶：小王，你们伤病员同志，就得听医生、护士的话，不能由着性儿来。小　凌：瞧，沙奶奶都批评你啦！小　王：哼！沙奶奶特别喜欢你，所以说话老向着你呗！沙奶奶：你说我向着她，我就向着她。人家闺女说话办事，总站在理上，我就是喜欢她嘛！小　王：沙奶奶，明儿个让七龙跟我们走，把小凌给您留下，我们拿姑娘换您一个小子！沙奶奶：那敢情好啦！沙奶奶这辈子养了七个儿子，就是缺个闺女呀！小　凌：沙奶奶，您总说有七个儿子，怎么我们就看见七龙一个人哪！沙奶奶：唉！那都是过去的事，提它干什么！小　王：沙奶奶，您说给我们听听。小　凌：沙奶奶，我们都想听听。沙奶奶：唉！（唱二黄三眼）
        说来话长……
        想当年家贫困无力抚养，
        七个儿有五个短命夭亡。
        遭荒年欠下了刁家的阎王账，
        为抵债他四哥去把活儿扛。
        刁老财蛇蝎心肠忒毒狠，
        他四哥，终日辛劳，遭受毒打，
            伤重身亡。
        七龙儿脾气暴性情倔犟，
        闯进刁家论短长。
        刁老财他说是夜入民宅，非偷即
            抢，
        可怜他十六岁孩子也坐牢房。
        新四军打下了沙家浜，
        我的儿出牢房重见日光。
        共产党象他的亲娘（叫散）一样！小　凌：沙奶奶，说得对呀！沙奶奶：（接唱）　无有党早已是家破人亡！
          〔阿祥端一碗团子上。小　王：沙奶奶，有了共产党咱们穷人就不怕他们了！阿　祥：沙奶奶！沙奶奶：阿祥，你有事吗？阿　祥：我妈叫我给指导员送点团子来。沙奶奶：我那儿也蒸好啦！阿　祥：我妈说这是对咱们军队的一点心意啊！沙奶奶：说得对，放在这篮子里，回头我蒸热了给他们吃！阿　祥：小王，李大娘等着你拿口袋装稻子哪！小　王：对啦！（拿起口袋欲走，又回身）沙奶奶！那个刁老财他在哪儿？沙奶奶：怎么，还想着这档子事哪？刁老财早死了，他还有个儿子，多年在外边念书，现在也不知道哪儿去了。小　凌：行了，别刨根问底啦！李大娘等着口袋藏粮食哪！阿　祥：咱们一块儿走。（与小王同下。）
          〔沙奶奶提篮子，要去洗衣服。小　凌：沙奶奶您又去洗衣裳！我去洗！沙奶奶：指导员带着轻伤员同志们，帮助我们干活儿，我洗两件衣裳，还不应该吗？小　凌：我跟您一块儿去。（与沙奶奶同下。）
          〔郭建光与叶思中、小李划船上。叶思中、郭建光把一箩一箩的谷子运下船。郭建光：叶排长！（指谷子）把它替沙奶奶坚壁起来！叶思中：好！（将谷子挑到沙奶奶屋后。）郭建光：（唱西皮原板）
        朝霞映在阳澄湖上，
        芦花放稻谷香岸柳成行。

        为的是早早（叫散）回前方！
          〔沙奶奶偕小凌上。郭建光：沙奶奶！沙奶奶：指导员，同志们都回来啦！郭建光：回来啦，稻子都收完啦，您的稻子，给您藏在房后地窖里啦！沙奶奶：好好！累坏了，快歇会儿吧！你瞧，这是阿祥给你们送来的团子。郭建光：乡亲们待我们太好啦！小　凌：指导员，沙奶奶又帮我们洗衣裳去啦！沙奶奶：这姑娘，这不是应该的吗！

       （唱西皮摇板）
        同志们杀敌挂了花，
        沙家浜就是你们的家。
        乡亲们若有怠慢处，
        说出来我就去批评他。郭建光：（看叶思中）沙奶奶叫咱们提意见。（对沙奶奶）沙奶奶，我给您提个意见！沙奶奶：哦！那就快说吧！郭建光：好吧。（唱西皮摇板）

        精心调理总不差。
        缝补浆洗不停手，
        一日三餐有鱼虾。
        同志们说，似这样长期来住下，
        只怕是，心也宽，体也胖，
        路也走不动，山也不能爬，
        怎能上战场把敌杀。沙奶奶：瞧你说的！郭建光：（接唱）待等同志们伤痊愈——沙奶奶：（接唱）伤痊愈，也不准离开我家。
        要你们一日三餐九碗饭，
        一觉睡到日西斜。
        直养得腰圆膀又乍，
        一个个象座黑铁塔，
        到那时，身强力壮跨战马……郭建光：（接唱）驰骋江南把敌杀。
        消灭汉奸清匪霸，
        打得那日本强盗回老家。
        等到那云开日出，家家都把红旗
            挂，
        再来探望你这革命的老妈妈。沙奶奶：好！你沙奶奶就盼着这一天。叶思中：沙奶奶，您准能盼到。您和乡亲们待我们这样好，我们一定能把日本鬼子赶出中国去！沙奶奶：噢？郭建光：是啊！“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下，个把日本帝国主义是不够打的。”沙奶奶：这话是谁说的？郭建光：毛主席。沙奶奶：毛主席！这话说得好哇。
          〔阿庆嫂由另一方向匆匆上。阿庆嫂：指导员，鬼子开始“扫荡”啦，进行得很快！县委指示，要同志们到芦荡里暂避一时。船和干粮，我都准备好啦！郭建光：阿庆嫂，你通知民兵，带乡亲们转移出去，把余下的粮食坚壁起来！阿庆嫂：（对郭建光）你放心吧。就到咱们看好的地方去，到时候我再接你们！

          〔阿庆嫂下，沙奶奶进屋。
          〔灯光转暗。炮声、枪声渐近，远处火光起，难民逃过。日军追过。
