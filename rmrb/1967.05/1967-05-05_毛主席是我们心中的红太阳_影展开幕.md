The triumphant march of the proletarian revolutionary line
An epic of the glorious struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution
“Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts” Photo Exhibition Opens

The exhibition vividly depicts how the greatest leader, Chairman Mao, personally ignited the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, inspected over 11 million cultural revolutionaries on eight occasions, and shared the same breath and destiny with the masses, providing powerful support for the mass movement.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on May 4th, at a time when the world is celebrating the resounding victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and on the eve of the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work “Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,” another piece of good news has come from China's cultural front: the photo exhibition “Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts,” composed of large portraits of Chairman Mao, opened today at the National Art Museum of China.

In an era where the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao continues to achieve victories and Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly embraced by the people, the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world yearn even more for the great leader Chairman Mao. Even those who have been inspected by Chairman Mao and seen films of Chairman Mao inspecting the cultural revolutionaries have expressed strong wishes to better admire Chairman Mao's glorious image and have called for the collection and display of Chairman Mao's photographs. Now, in the revolutionary situation where the masses are united to criticize the handful of capitalists within the party, people's wishes have finally been realized! The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres will once again receive the affectionate care and great encouragement of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao from the photo exhibition “Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts”!

This photo exhibition, organized to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of “Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,” is the fruit of the revolutionary photographers' struggle against a handful of revisionists in the photography industry and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line backed by the number one capitalist-roader within the party. It is a new victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line!

The preface of the exhibition quotes Vice Chairman Lin Biao's profound statement: “Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage.”

The photo exhibition displayed in the central hall of the National Art Museum of China is accompanied by reproductions of Chairman Mao's quotations and handwritten manuscripts of his poems. A prominent banner on the opposite side of the hall expresses the common voice of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people: “Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!” The 60 photos of Chairman Mao in the exhibition shine like the radiant sun, making the exhibition hall exceptionally bright. These photographs, which capture Chairman Mao's various activities during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, truly depict the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, Chairman Mao, who personally ignited the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, inspected over 11 million cultural revolutionaries on eight occasions, shared the same breath and destiny with the masses, and supported the mass revolutionary movement. This is an epic recording the glorious struggle of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a triumphant march of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

People clearly remember the more than fifty days around last July when dark clouds temporarily appeared in the sky. At that time, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, proposed and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, practiced bourgeois dictatorship, surrounded the revolutionary faction, and attempted to suppress the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It was precisely at this critical moment that Chairman Mao presided over the convening of the historic Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, formulated the “Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,” and proclaimed the victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line. The photo of Chairman Mao smiling and applauding to express congratulations at the closing of this plenary session is now on display in this photo exhibition, reuniting with the broad revolutionary masses.

Less than a week after this photo was taken, when the Red Guards, the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, had just been born and their revolutionary actions were being suppressed and criticized by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the old forces of habit, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao ascended the Tiananmen Gate, met with hundreds of thousands of Red Guard youths, and firmly declared, “I firmly support you!” Look, in the photo capturing the scene at that time in the exhibition, the benevolent and affectionate Chairman Mao, wearing a bright red Red Guard armband, is beaming with joy, full of vigor, and waving to the Red Guard youths who are accepting the inspection!

Seeing the photo of Chairman Mao standing side by side with his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao on the Tiananmen Gate, people naturally recall our great teacher's lofty evaluation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao, looking at the spirited and enthusiastic cultural revolutionary army, happily said to Comrade Lin Biao, “This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses, which has great significance for the ideological transformation of the people of the whole country.” On another photo with the vast cultural revolutionary army as the background, Chairman Mao's two great calls during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are written on both sides: “You should care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!” “You should put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution even better.”

From the exhibition, it can be seen that Chairman Mao in the photos, whether standing on the Tiananmen Gate or riding in an open-top car, whether sitting on the ground with revolutionary youths celebrating the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China last year or celebrating May Day, the International Labor Day, with three million revolutionary masses in the capital this year, whether inspecting China's cultural revolutionary army or receiving foreign friends who came to China to enthusiastically congratulate the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he always trusts the masses, supports the masses, and respects the masses' spirit of initiative! The broad revolutionary masses love, respect, and admire Chairman Mao so much! The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. Chairman Mao is always with the revolutionary masses, always with the revolutionary masses heart to heart, and always the red sun in our hearts!

Today, the workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres from the capital who came to view this photo exhibition entered the exhibition hall filled with Chairman Mao's photos, as if they were in the Sun Palace, feeling extremely warm and bright! These revolutionary fighters on the front line of criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party saw their beloved Chairman Mao in one photo after another, received great encouragement, and felt an endless surge of strength. A soldier wrote on the spot: “Gazing at Chairman Mao's portrait, the red sun rises in my heart. Revolutionary fighters love you the most, wishing you eternal life! Eternal life!” The audience, immersed in the warm current of happiness, some spoke passionately, some wrote swiftly, and some raised their right hands excitedly, solemnly vowing in front of the glorious image of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we will forever be loyal to you! Thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

This is the first time in China to hold a photo exhibition composed of Chairman Mao's photos. In the past, revolutionary photographers had repeatedly proposed to hold such an exhibition, but the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, fearing that Chairman Mao's glorious image would meet the revolutionary masses, created various excuses and so-called reasons to obstruct and reject it. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the East Is Red Revolutionary Rebel Group of the Chinese Revolutionary Photography Association seized the power from the capitalist-roaders within the old Photography Association, rebelled against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, and with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, jointly organized with the Red Rebel Group of the Chinese Artists Association and the National Art Museum of China this photo exhibition “Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts” in a very short time.

    无产阶级革命路线的动人凯歌　文化大革命战斗历程的光辉史诗
    “毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”影展开幕
    影展真实地表现了最伟大的领袖毛主席亲手点燃无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，先后八次检阅一千一百多万文化革命大军，和群众同呼吸，共命运，大力支持群众运动的伟大实践。
    据新华社四日讯　在举世欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌胜利的时候，在毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年前夕，我国文艺战线上传来了又一喜讯：由巨幅毛主席照片组成的“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”摄影展览，今天在中国美术馆隆重开幕。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线不断取得胜利，毛泽东思想日益深入人心的时代潮流中，全中国和全世界革命人民更加思念伟大领袖毛主席。就是那些接受过毛主席检阅和看过毛主席检阅文化革命大军影片的广大革命群众，为了能够更好地瞻仰毛主席的光辉形象，也纷纷提出强烈愿望，要求把毛主席的照片集中地编制和陈列出来。现在，在万众奋起批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命形势下，人们的愿望终于实现了！广大工农兵、革命师生和革命干部，将从“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”的摄影展览中，再一次领受我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和巨大鼓舞！
    这个为庆祝《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年而筹办的摄影展览，是革命的摄影工作者同摄影界一小撮修正主义分子，同以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺路线进行斗争的成果，是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的新胜利！
    展览的前言部分，摘录了林彪副主席的精辟论断：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”
    陈列在中国美术馆中央厅的这个摄影展览，配有毛主席语录和毛主席诗词影印手稿，大厅对面的一幅醒目的大字标语表达了亿万革命人民的共同心声：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”影展中全部六十张毛主席照片，象光芒四射的红太阳，使展览大厅显得格外明亮。这些摄录毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中各种活动的照片，真实地表现了当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，全中国和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，亲手点燃无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，并先后八次接见和检阅了一千一百多万文化革命大军，和群众同呼吸，共命运，支持群众的革命运动的伟大实践。这是一部纪录我国无产阶级文化大革命战斗历程的光辉史诗，这是一曲毛主席无产阶级革命路线节节胜利的动人凯歌！
    人们清楚地记得去年七月前后天空暂时出现乌云的那五十多天。当时，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，提出和推行资产阶级反动路线，实行资产阶级专政，围剿革命派，妄图把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命打下去。正是在这个严重关头，毛主席主持召开了具有伟大历史意义的党的八届十一中全会，制定了《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，宣告了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利，宣告了资产阶级反动路线的破产。毛主席在这次全会闭幕时含笑鼓掌，表示祝贺的照片，现在就陈列在这个摄影展览中，重新和广大革命群众见面。
    在这张照片拍摄后不到一星期，在无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋红卫兵刚刚诞生，他们的革命行动遭到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和旧的习惯势力的各种压制和非难的时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，登上天安门城楼，接见了百万红卫兵小将，坚定地表示：“我坚决支持你们！”看哪，在影展中摄录当时场景的一张照片里，慈祥而又亲切的毛主席，佩戴鲜红鲜红的红卫兵袖章，满面红光，神采奕奕，正在向接受检阅的红卫兵小将招手致意！
    看到毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志并排站立在天安门城楼上的照片，人们很自然地回忆起我们的伟大导师对无产阶级文化大革命的崇高评价。毛主席看着意气风发、斗志昂扬的文化革命大军，高兴地对林彪同志说：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”在另一张以浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军为背景的毛主席照片两旁，写有毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中发出的两个伟大号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”
    从影展中可以看出，照片里的毛主席，无论是站立在天安门城楼上，还是乘坐在敞篷汽车上，无论是去年和革命小将在一起席地而坐庆祝中华人民共和国成立十七周年，还是今年和首都三百万革命群众在一起欢度“五一”国际劳动节，无论是检阅我国文化革命大军，还是接见前来我国热烈祝贺无产阶级文化大革命胜利的外国朋友，他老人家都是那样信任群众，那样支持群众，那样尊重群众的首创精神！广大革命群众对毛主席是那样无限热爱，那样无限敬仰，那样无限崇拜！大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，毛主席永远和革命群众在一起，毛主席永远和革命群众心连心，毛主席永远是我们心中最红最红的红太阳！
    今天前往观看这个摄影展览的首都工农兵、革命师生和革命干部，走进遍布毛主席照片的展览大厅，犹如置身在太阳宫一样，感到无比温暖，无比明亮！这些战斗在批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派第一线的革命战士，从一张张照片中见到了自己日夜思念的毛主席，受到了巨大的鼓舞，浑身上下增添了无穷的力量。一个解放军战士当场写道：“瞻仰毛主席像，心中升起红太阳，革命战士最爱您，祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”浸沉在幸福暖流中的观众们，有的慷慨陈词，有的挥笔疾书，有的激动地举起右手，在最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象面前庄严宣誓：毛主席呀毛主席，我们永远忠于您！彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    举办由毛主席照片组成的摄影展览，这在我国还是第一次。过去，革命的摄影工作者曾多次提出举办这种影展的建议，但党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派唯恐毛主席的光辉形象和革命群众见面，制造种种借口和所谓理由加以阻挠和拒绝。在无产阶级文化大革命中，中国革命摄影协会东方红革命造反队夺了旧摄影学会走资本主义道路当权派的权，造了反革命修正主义文艺路线的反，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，在很短的时间内，就和中国美术家协会、中国美术馆红色造反队联合筹办了这个“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”的摄影展览。
