Editor's Note: On the issue of what kind of successors to cultivate and how to cultivate them, there has always been a serious struggle between two lines.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and are tempered in the great storms of revolution." The heroes and models from units such as the "Vanguard Boat," "Tiger Boat," and "Eagle Squadron" have all grown up following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, tempered in the gunfire of the battlefield and the storms of class struggle. They say well: "The more you are tossed about in the struggles of the masses, the more Mao Zedong Thought you gain, and the higher your proletarian consciousness rises." Only by rolling in the mud of mass struggles a thousand times can you truly master the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, only then can you firmly uphold the proletarian stand, enhance proletarian feelings, and withstand any storm or danger. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we can cultivate millions of such steadfast successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, ensuring that our great socialist motherland will forever remain red.

The capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the number one capitalist roader, advocate a reactionary line that separates from real class struggle and the masses to promote bourgeois individualism under the guise of "cultivation." This is essentially a bourgeois stand, aiming to compete with the proletariat for the younger generation. Following the teachings of "Cultivation," one can only cultivate personal ambition, intrigue, hypocrisy, cowardice, and traitors, producing bourgeois successors rather than proletarian revolutionary warriors.

The proletarian revolutionaries must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and follow the five conditions for proletarian revolutionary successors proposed by Chairman Mao. In the storms of class struggle, temper and transform yourself. Pass on the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, ensuring that our ironclad socialist country remains unshakable for eternity.

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and in the storms of class struggle, the heroes and models of the People's Liberation Army Navy have grown up. Recently, they held a symposium to denounce "Cultivation" based on their personal experiences, fiercely criticizing the bourgeois idealism of "Cultivation" advocated by the number one capitalist roader within the Party. They said: We have been able to fearlessly face gunfire, remain steadfast amidst storms and waves, and navigate through clouds and fog, all thanks to the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. If we were to follow the poisonous teachings of "Cultivation," separating from real class struggle and secluding ourselves in rooms for "self-cultivation," we would only become more and more like revisionists, personal ambition seekers, schemers, hypocrites, cowards, and traitors, becoming successors of the landlord and bourgeoisie, and never true selfless, fearless, and invincible proletarian revolutionary warriors. Cultivating what kind of successors and how to cultivate them is a serious class struggle, a matter of paramount importance to the state's future. They are determined to follow the five conditions for proletarian revolutionary successors proposed by Chairman Mao, to struggle in the storms of class struggle, and to truly temper themselves into a new generation of communists armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Experience the storms and see the world, temper yourself in the actual class struggle, this is the fundamental path to cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Deputy Political Instructor of the "Vanguard Boat," Second-Class Hero Zhang Linsheng said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and are tempered in the great storms of revolution. We should, in the long-term struggle of the masses, examine and identify cadres, select and cultivate successors." This is the only correct path for the proletariat to cultivate revolutionary successors. The number one capitalist roader within the Party, however, in his "Cultivation," maliciously proposes a completely opposite path. He separates from real class struggle, revolution, and political struggle, vigorously promoting idealist cultivation theory. We must firmly follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, the path of heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Jiao Yulu, Mai Xiande, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang. Our "Vanguard Boat" has also grown up following this path indicated by Chairman Mao over the past decade, tempered in the storms of the sea. Comrades say well: Each time we fight against the American and Kuomintang warships, each time we struggle against nature, our fighting spirit is enhanced, and our thoughts of serving the people are deepened. The more we are tossed about in the struggles of the masses, the more Mao Zedong Thought we gain, and the higher our proletarian consciousness rises.

Our disagreement with the number one capitalist roader within the Party on how to cultivate successors is not just a disagreement over methods, but a fundamental disagreement between two classes, two paths, and two lines. The proletariat needs successors who meet the five standards set by Chairman Mao to carry the revolutionary cause to the end, and must use the "Three Articles" as textbooks, following the path of experiencing storms, seeing the world, and tempering oneself in actual struggles. The number one capitalist roader within the Party, however, needs revisionist successors with a mind full of individualism to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, and thus must use "Cultivation" as a textbook, following the path of idealist cultivation separated from revolutionary practice. On the issue of how to cultivate successors, there is a fierce struggle between two classes, two paths, and two lines. Succession is about seizing power. We, who grew up in the bitter waters of the old society, understand the importance of political power, the importance of the printing press and the gun. The number one capitalist roader within the Party and his accomplices attempt to use bourgeois ideology, walk the bourgeois path, cultivate bourgeois successors, so that when the time comes, they can seize our proletarian political power, making the broad masses of workers and peasants suffer again, walk back to the old society, and be oppressed and exploited as slaves. This is absolutely unacceptable!

Only by experiencing storms and seeing the world can you master a firm and correct political direction and truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

Original Boat Captain of Mai Xiande's Boat, First-Class Hero Cai Fuxun said:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Youth should place a firm and correct political direction in the first place," "Without a correct political standpoint, it is as if there is no soul." The firm and correct political direction of our revolutionary warriors is the great Mao Zedong Thought, it is what Vice Chairman Lin calls us to do: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

Sailors who do not go to sea for a long time will get seasick and lose their way. Proletarian revolutionary successors who do not experience storms and see the world cannot truly master a firm and correct political direction—Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution, and only by actively learning and applying it in the fiery struggles can one truly understand and apply it. Our close comrade Mai Xiande often said: I am willing to struggle and temper myself in storms and rains, and I do not want to spend my life in peaceful days. After enlisting, he studied the "Three Articles" the most and applied them the best, always in harsh conditions of storms and waves, strictly demanding of himself, following Chairman Mao's teachings, tempering his thoughts, will, and style. After enlisting for more than a year, in the "August 6th" naval battle, he suffered a severe head injury but fought for three hours. This is because he actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works in the storms of class struggle, mastered a firm and correct political direction, and had a heart that was infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao. A thousand-mile horse cannot be raised in a stable, and a thousand-year-old pine cannot grow in a flowerpot. Mai Xiande-like iron warriors can only grow up under the nurturing of the great Mao Zedong Thought, in the storms of class struggle, and cannot be produced in the study rooms of landlords and bourgeoisie. If we were to follow the feudalist and capitalist "cultivation" advocated by the number one capitalist roader within the Party, not only would we never master a firm and correct political direction in our lifetime, but we would definitely become more and more revisionist the more we cultivate.

Fighting Hero Shu Jicheng said:

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To learn Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the masses of workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." Recently, I went to the countryside to support the left and support agriculture, and in the actual struggles, I deeply felt that only by experiencing the storms and seeing the world in the struggles of the masses, by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggles, can one truly understand Chairman Mao's teachings, master the correct political direction, and stand firm. This is the same as us pilots flying. It's not enough to just talk on the ground; one must go up to the sky to train, fly in various weather conditions, to maintain a very clear mind and not lose direction in any complex situation.

The number one capitalist roader within the Party wants us to separate from reality, the masses, and real class struggle, to read books in seclusion, to cultivate Confucian ethics, not letting us experience storms and see the world. His evil intentions are to make us separate from Mao Zedong Thought, leading us onto the political direction of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. We are the proletarian revolutionary army personally created and nurtured by Chairman Mao. We must always maintain the character of our army, actively participate in the practical struggles of social class struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, strengthen the revolutionary construction of the troops, and never let their plots succeed.

Only by experiencing storms and seeing the world can you thoroughly transform your thoughts and eliminate selfishness to establish public-mindedness.

First-Class Hero Pilot Gao Xiang of the "Eagle Squadron" said: The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us to be like Comrade Norman Bethune, "completely selfless and dedicated to others," to be like Comrade Zhang Thiede, "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people. However, the number one capitalist roader within the Party, in his "Cultivation," sings the opposite tune to Chairman Mao's teachings, obliquely promoting bourgeois individualism. Whether to serve the public or the self is the fundamental opposition of worldviews between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Proletarian revolutionary successors must thoroughly eliminate selfish thoughts, establish a communist worldview of wholeheartedly serving the public, to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

Eliminating selfishness to establish public-mindedness is a revolution of the mind. To revolutionize, one must struggle, and it is fundamentally impossible to solve problems by secluding oneself for cultivation. In struggles, the more you eliminate, the faster and more thoroughly you eliminate; the more you establish, the better and more firmly you establish. In a dogfight, we encountered an enemy aircraft that was far superior to us in equipment and technical performance, but we decisively shot it down. What did we rely on? We relied on close combat, bravery, and fearlessness of death. The closer to the enemy aircraft, the greater the chance of victory, but the greater the danger. Whether to have the courage to fight such close combat, whether to remain calm and composed in such critical moments, to actively, calmly, and flexibly respond to the enemy, the key lies in eliminating all selfish thoughts, having only the public in mind. If we were to follow the philosophy of life and traitor philosophy advocated in the "Cultivation" by the number one capitalist roader within the Party, such as "in necessary times, one should give up some of the Party's work to preserve comrades," "love oneself, protect one's life and health," etc., we would not be able to go to the battlefield at all, and even if we went, we would definitely be deserters, traitors, and cowards.

The comrades of the "Eagle Squadron" guarding the coastal frontline have grown up by eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness in the storms of revolutionary struggles. We deeply feel: Mao Zedong Thought is our most sharp weapon to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, the storms of class struggle are the best classroom to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, the most difficult and sharp struggles are the best grinding stones to temper our proletarian worldview. The path to cultivating proletarian revolutionary successors indicated by Chairman Mao is the bright road for us to grow into proletarian revolutionary successors. Following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely become selfless and fearless communist warriors.

Deputy Boat Captain of the "Tiger Boat," First-Class Hero Wu Jiaxi said:

Chairman Mao often teaches us: "The masses are the true heroes." In doing anything, we rely on two things: one is Mao Zedong Thought, and the other is the power of the masses. Thought transformation is also like this; without putting oneself in the struggles of the masses, without the fiery education and supervision of the masses, one cannot be well transformed.

"Cultivation" wears the cloak of Marxism-Leninism, full of righteousness and morality, very deceiving. Before enlisting, I was also deceived. After enlisting, with the help of comrades, I actively learned and applied the "Three Articles," understanding that serving the people cannot have even a hint of selfishness, and my mind became clear. From then on, I threw away the teachings of "Cultivation," striving to learn Chairman Mao's works, and from the masses, I found many living teachers who actively learned and applied the "Three Articles." I learned from the masses and worked with the masses, my thoughts became correct, and my progress was faster. The battle of Chongwu sounded, this was a class struggle in the sea, a battle of guns against guns, cannons against cannons. For me, this was also a decisive battle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Not only did I, together with comrades, shoot down the enemies at sea, but I also discovered new living teachers and teaching materials from the comrades, helping me to further understand the brilliance of the "Three Articles," further eliminating the selfish thoughts in my mind. Personal experience makes me deeply feel that Chairman Mao's teaching that "the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and are tempered in the great storms of revolution" is an absolute truth.

Only by experiencing storms and seeing the world can you learn the skills of class struggle.

Sergeant of the "Tiger Boat," Second-Class Hero Qian Konghua said:

Chairman Mao teaches us: In the historical stage of socialism, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. Never forget class struggle. Vice Chairman Lin also repeatedly reminds us that class struggle is a main course, participating in the struggles of the masses is a most lively, rich, and profound political classroom. The number one capitalist roader within the Party vigorously opposes Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. In "Cultivation," he repeatedly advocates peaceful and secluded cultivation, not mentioning real class struggle, not mentioning the struggle to seize and consolidate political power, not mentioning how to learn class struggle in the storms of the masses, attempting to make us abandon the main course of class struggle, disarm us politically and ideologically, making us into confused people who do not care about state affairs and do not understand politics, following him to take over the revisionist class. This is absolutely unacceptable, a million times unacceptable!

From our own struggles, we deeply feel: Class struggle is the best classroom to quickly cultivate proletarian revolutionary successors. In the recent struggles to support the left, support industry, and support agriculture, this feeling is even deeper. First, going to the class struggle to experience storms and see the world can quickly enhance one's eyesight. We have seen various types of class enemies, seen the various disguises of the enemy, seen the dark corners of "old ghosts and snakes," those who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, those who disguise as "corpses" but are poisonous snakes, those who transform into beautiful women but are white-boned demons, greatly enhancing our ability to identify the enemy. Second, it can quickly enhance one's intelligence. By personally struggling with the ghosts and snakes, we have learned the character of the enemy, learned to use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the enemy's heart and mind, to fight against the enemy's tricks, to learn the skills to defeat the enemy. Third, it can quickly enhance one's resistance. The various tricks of the enemy are living negative examples, greatly enhancing our awareness and ability to resist peaceful evolution. The matter is clear, the number one capitalist roader within the Party does not want us to go to the struggles of the masses, fearing that we will enhance our eyesight, intelligence, and resistance in class struggle.

A certain platoon leader, First-Class Hero Xu Yongjiang said:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "No matter who wants to understand something, apart from contacting that thing, living in (practicing in) that environment, there is no way to solve it.... You want knowledge, you must participate in the practice of changing reality." "Learn warfare from warfare—this is our main method." Our unit changed from the army to the navy, from only knowing land warfare to learning naval warfare, all following Chairman Mao's teachings, relying on the sea battlefield as a classroom, using the enemy as a live target, fighting while training, learning to fight. We fight one battle and progress one step, fight three or two battles, becoming braver, smarter, and freer with each fight. In the "August 6th" naval battle of 1965, we, together with our brother units, swallowed the enemy ships that were much larger than us. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to highlight politics, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, temper and grow even faster.

"Tiger Boat" Deputy Squad Leader, Second-Class Hero Ge Yi said:

The number one capitalist roader within the Party attempts to lock us up for life, using the teachings of the landlord and bourgeoisie to poison us, peacefully evolving us into his successors for capitalist restoration. This is pure fantasy. Chairman Mao says: "We Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the storm of mass struggles, and this world is the world of mass struggles." From my personal experience, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's teaching is extremely wise, extremely great, and extremely correct. I am a child of a revolutionary cadre, before enlisting, I only went from the home gate to the school gate and back, because I had not contacted the masses of workers and peasants and actual struggles, I thought mostly about my personal future and interests. Coming to the People's Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, my thoughts and feelings have changed greatly, through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's brilliant works, contacting the people, gradually establishing a worldview of wholeheartedly serving the people, having deep class feelings for the working people. Participating in the Chongwu naval battle further enhanced my class struggle consciousness. I deeply feel that my growth process is a process of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, actively learning and applying the "Three Articles" in struggles, a process of growing up in the storms of class struggle. The poisonous weed "Cultivation" is a textbook for cultivating landlord and bourgeois young masters and misses, a catalyst for producing revisionism, an opium that numbs and poisons people's souls. We, the revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never be deceived by it. Let the number one capitalist roader within the Party and his "Cultivation" go to hell.

Comrade of Mai Xiande, First-Class Hero Chen Wenyi said:

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great struggle between two classes, two paths, and two lines related to the future and destiny of our country, a great struggle of seizing power and counter-seizing power, and also a great struggle of seizing successors. The brilliant "Three Articles" are the motto of the proletarian revolutionaries, a compulsory course for the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We must take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a great classroom to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, actively learn and apply the "Three Articles," like Zhang Thiede, "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, like Norman Bethune, "completely selfless and dedicated to others," like Old Yu Gong, "determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." In the great revolution, great struggle, and great criticism, temper and grow, become reliable successors of Mao Zedong Thought. We must learn and carry forward the spirit of Mai Xiande, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, "dare to be skinned alive, dare to pull the emperor off his horse," resolutely overthrow, smash, and stink up the number one capitalist roader within the Party; resolutely uproot the poisonous root of "Cultivation"!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长
    ——人民解放军海军部分战斗英雄、模范举行座谈，愤怒批判《修养》
    编者按：在培养什么样的接班人，如何培养接班人的问题上，始终存在着两条路线的严重斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”“海上先锋艇”、“海上猛虎艇”和“海空雄鹰团”等单位的英雄模范们，正是按照毛主席的这条无产阶级革命路线，在枪林弹雨的战场上，在阶级斗争的风浪中，锻炼成长起来的。他们说得好：“在群众斗争中多摔打一次，毛泽东思想就增多一分，无产阶级觉悟就提高一步。”只有在群众斗争的泥巴里滚上千百次，才能真正掌握战无不胜的毛泽东思想，才能坚定无产阶级立场，增强无产阶级感情，才能经得起任何惊涛险浪的考验。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，培养出千百万这样坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，我们伟大的社会主义祖国，才能永远保持鲜红的颜色。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线，却鼓吹脱离现实阶级斗争、脱离群众去搞资产阶级个人主义的“修养”。这实质上是站在资产阶级立场上，和无产阶级争夺青年一代。按照《修养》那一套说教去做，只能“修养”成为个人野心家、阴谋家、伪君子、怕死鬼、叛徒，只能培养出资产阶级的接班人，决不能培养无产阶级的革命战士。
    无产阶级革命派一定要牢记毛主席的教导，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，在阶级斗争的大风浪中，锻炼自己，改造自己。把光焰无际的毛泽东思想一代代传下去，使我国社会主义铁打的江山，千秋万代永不变色。
    在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长起来的人民解放军海军战斗英雄和功臣，最近举行座谈，以切身经历怒斥《修养》，狠批党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派宣扬的资产阶级唯心主义
  “修养”术。他们说：我们所以能够枪林弹雨不畏难，险风恶浪不动摇，云天雾海不迷航，就是靠光焰无际的毛泽东思想。如果照大毒草《修养》所宣扬的一套去做，脱离现实的阶级斗争，关在房子里“修身养性”，只能越“养”越“修”，越修养越成为修正主义，越成为个人野心家、阴谋家、伪君子、怕死鬼，成为地主资产阶级的接班人，根本不可能培养出无私、无畏、无敌的无产阶级革命战士。培养什么样的接班人和如何培养接班人，是一场严重的阶级斗争，是关系到国家前途的头等大事。他们决心按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中搏斗，把自己真正锻炼成为用毛泽东思想武装起来的一代共产主义新人。
    经风雨，见世面，到阶级斗争实际中锻炼，是培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的根本道路
    “海上先锋艇”副指导员、二等功臣张林生说：毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。应当在长期的群众斗争中，考察和识别干部，挑选和培养接班人。”这是无产阶级培养革命接班人唯一正确的道路。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在他的《修养》里却别有用心地提出了一条完全相反的道路。他脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命，脱离政治斗争，极力宣扬唯心主义的修养论。我们培养无产阶级革命事业接班人要坚决走毛主席指引的道路，走雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、焦裕禄、麦贤得、刘英俊、蔡永祥等无产阶级英雄人物的成长道路。我们“海上先锋艇”，十多年来也正是沿着毛主席指引的这一道路，在大风大浪中锻炼成长的。同志们说得好：我们跟美蒋军舰搏斗一次，跟大自然斗争一次，战斗勇气就提高一步，为人民服务思想就增添一分。在群众斗争中多摔打一次，毛泽东思想就增多一分，无产阶级觉悟就提高一步。
    我们和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在如何培养接班人问题上的分歧，决不是什么方法问题的分歧，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的根本分歧。无产阶级要将革命事业进行到底，需要的是符合毛主席规定的五条标准的无产阶级革命者当接班人，必须以“老三篇”为教材，走经风雨，见世面，在实际斗争中锻炼成长的路；党内头号走资本主义道路当权派要进行反革命复辟，需要的是满脑子个人主义思想的修正主义者当接班人，就一定是以《修养》为教材，走脱离革命实践的唯心主义的修养的路。在如何培养接班人的问题上，充满了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。接班就是接权。我们是在旧社会苦水里长大的人，最懂得政权的重要，懂得印把子和枪杆子的重要。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其同伙者，妄图用资产阶级思想，走资产阶级道路，培养资产阶级接班人，以便一旦时机到来，就伸出黑手来夺取我们无产阶级政权，使我们广大工农群众吃二遍苦，走回头路，再回到旧社会去受压迫受剥削，当奴隶。这是万万办不到的！
    只有经风雨，见世面，才能掌握坚定正确的政治方向，才能掌握毛泽东思想
    麦贤得所在艇原艇长、一等功臣崔福俊说：
    毛主席教导我们：“青年应该把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位”，“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”我们革命战士的坚定正确的政治方向就是伟大的毛泽东思想，就是林副主席号召我们的：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    水兵长期不出海就会晕船呕吐，不辨方向。无产阶级革命事业接班人不经风雨，见世面，就不能真正掌握坚定正确的政治方向——毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是革命的科学，只有在火热的斗争中活学活用，才能真正学懂，真正会用。我们的亲密战友麦贤得过去经常说：愿在暴风雨中艰苦奋斗锻炼自己，不愿在平平静静的日子里度过自己的一生。他入伍以后，学习“老三篇”最多，用的最活，总是在风险浪恶的艰苦条件下，严格要求自己，按照毛主席的教导，练思想，练斗志，练作风。入伍一年多，在“八·六”海战中，头部负重伤，坚持战斗三个小时，就是因为他在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，掌握了坚定正确的政治方向，有一颗无限忠于毛主席的红心。马厩里养不出千里马，花盆里长不出万年松。麦贤得式的钢铁战士，只能在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争的风雨中成长，不能在地主和资产阶级的书房里产生。如果照党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派提倡的那一套封建主义、资本主义的“修养”经去闭门修养，那不但一辈子掌握不了坚定正确的政治方向，而且一定是越修养越离开正道，越修养越成为修正主义。
    战斗英雄舒积成说：
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”最近我到农村参加支左、支农工作，在实际斗争中，我深深地体会到，只有经群众斗争的大风雨，见群众斗争的大世面，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，才能真正领会毛主席的教导，掌握正确的政治方向，站好队。这和我们飞行员搞飞行一样，光是在地面讲不行，只有到空中去锻炼，在各种气候条件下飞行，才能在任何复杂的情况下，保持非常清醒的头脑，不迷失方向。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派要我们脱离实际，脱离群众，脱离现实的阶级斗争，闭门读书，修孔孟之道，不让我们经风雨，见世面，他的恶毒用心就是企图使我们离开毛泽东思想，把我们引上资产阶级、修正主义的政治方向。我们是毛主席亲手缔造和培育的无产阶级革命军队，我们要永远保持我军的本色，积极参加社会阶级斗争的实践，活学活用毛主席著作，加强部队革命化建设，决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。
    只有经风雨，见世面，才能彻底改造思想，破私立公
    “海空雄鹰团”飞行员、一等功臣高翔说：伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，要象白求恩同志那样“毫不利己专门利人”，要象张思德同志那样“完全”“彻底”地为人民服务。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》里和毛主席的教导大唱反调，转弯抹角地宣扬资产阶级个人主义。为公还是为私，这是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的根本对立的世界观。无产阶级革命事业的接班人必须彻底破除私心杂念，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观，才能永远忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想。
    破私立公是思想革命。要革命就要斗争，离开革命斗争的实践闭门修养是根本不能解决问题的。在斗争中破，就破得快，破得彻底；在斗争中立，就立得好，立得牢。在一次空战中，我们遇到的一种敌机，在装备技术性能方面远比我们占优势，而我们却干干脆脆地把它揍掉了。我们靠的是什么呢？靠的是近战，是勇敢不怕死。愈靠近敌机，胜利的把握愈大，但危险也愈大。有没有决心打这种近战硬仗，在这种紧要关头能不能脸不变色心不跳，主动、沉着、灵活地应战，关键在于破除一切私心杂念，满脑子里都是一个公字。如果按照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》中宣扬的什么“在必要时还要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”啦，要“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”啦等等一套活命哲学、叛徒哲学去闭门修养，就根本上不了战场，即使上了战场也一定是个逃兵、叛徒、怕死鬼。
    我们守卫在海防前线的“海空雄鹰团”的同志们，正是在革命斗争的大风大浪中，大破私字大立公字成长起来的。我们切身体会到：毛泽东思想是我们破私立公的最锐利的武器，阶级斗争的大风大浪，是破私立公的最好的课堂，斗争最艰苦最尖锐的地方，是磨炼我们无产阶级世界观的最好的磨刀石。毛主席指引的培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的道路，是我们成长为无产阶级革命事业接班人的光明大道，沿着毛主席指引的道路前进，我们就一定会成为一个无私无畏的共产主义战士。
    “海上猛虎艇”副艇长、一等功臣吴加溪说：
    毛主席经常教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄”。我们办任何事情，最根本的是靠两条，一靠毛泽东思想，二靠群众的力量。思想改造也是这样，不把自己摆到群众斗争之中，没有群众斗争的烈火千烧万烤，得不到群众的教育和监督，是不能很好得到改造的。
    《修养》披着马列主义外衣，满口仁义道德，是很能迷惑人的，入伍前我也被迷惑过。入伍后，在同志们的帮助下，我活学活用“老三篇”，懂得了为人民服务不能有半点私心，思想豁然开朗了。从这以后，我丢掉了《修养》那一套，努力学习毛主席著作，又从群众中找到许多活学活用“老三篇”的活教员，跟群众学，跟着群众干，思想路正了，进步也快了。崇武海战打响了，这是一场枪对枪，炮对炮的阶级斗争的大风大浪，对我来说，也是一个破私立公的歼灭战，不但和同志们一起打掉了海上的敌人，而且从同志们中间又发现了新的活教员、活教材，帮助我又进一步体会到了光辉的“老三篇”的伟大，进一步打掉了头脑中的私字。亲身的经历使我深深体会到毛主席关于“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的”这一教导，是千真万确的真理。
    只有经风雨，见世面，才能学会阶级斗争的本领
    “海上猛虎艇”军士长、二等功臣邝孔华说：
    毛主席教导我们：在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。千万不要忘记阶级斗争。林副主席也一再告诫我们，阶级斗争是一门主课，参加群众斗争是一种最生动、最丰富、最深刻的政治课堂。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派极力和毛主席、林副主席唱反调。在《修养》中，他一再宣扬和和平平的闭门修养，闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，不谈参加夺取政权和巩固政权的斗争，不谈如何在群众斗争的大风雨中学会阶级斗争，妄图要我们丢掉阶级斗争这门主课，从政治上思想上解除我们的武装，使我们变成不关心国家大事、不懂得政治的糊涂虫，跟着他接修正主义的班。这，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
    我们从自己的斗争实践中深深体会到：阶级斗争是多快好省地造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的最好课堂。在最近参加支左、支工、支农的斗争中，对这一点体会更深刻。第一，到阶级斗争中去经风雨，见世面，可以迅速长眼力。我们见识了各式各样的阶级敌人，见识了敌人各式各样的伪装，见识了阴暗角落的
  “老牛鬼”，打着“红旗”反红旗的“大蛇神”，装成“僵尸”的毒蛇，化成美女的白骨精，大大增长了识别敌人的能力。第二，可以迅速长智力。亲自和牛鬼蛇神们较量一番，摸到了敌人的性格，学到了运用毛泽东思想，同敌人攻心斗智拚刺刀，斗倒敌人的本领。第三，可以迅速增长抗毒力。敌人的种种阴谋诡计，是活生生的反面教材，使我们大大提高了抵制和平演变的觉悟和能力。事情很明白，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派不让我们到群众斗争中去，就是害怕我们增强搞阶级斗争的眼力、智力和抗毒力。
    某部中队长、一等功臣许永江说：
    毛主席教导我们：“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的。……你要有知识，你就得参加变革现实的实践。”“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”我们部队从陆军改编为海军，从只会陆战到学会海战，就是遵循毛主席的教导，依靠海上的战场为课堂，以敌人为活靶，边打边练，学会打仗的。我们打一仗进一步，三打两打，越打越勇敢，越打越聪明，越打越自由。一九六五年“八·六”海战，我们和兄弟部队一道，把比我们大得多的敌舰吃掉了。我们一定要永远念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在三大革命运动的实践中更迅速地锻炼成长。
    大学“老三篇”，狠狠批《修养》，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长
      “海上猛虎艇”副班长、二等功臣葛毅说：
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，妄图把我们一生一世关在房子里，用地主阶级、资产阶级的说教毒化我们，把我们舒舒服服地“和平演变”成他复辟资本主义的接班人。这纯是妄想。毛主席说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”我从自己的亲身经历中，深深体会到毛主席的这一教导无比英明，无比伟大，无比正确。我是一个革命干部的子弟，入伍前，只是从家门到学校门，从学校门到家门来回串，因为没有接触过工农群众和实际斗争，想的多半是个人前途和利益。来到解放军这个毛泽东思想大学校里，我的思想感情发生了很大的变化，通过活学活用毛主席的光辉著作，活学活用“老三篇”，同人民群众接触，使我逐步树立起全心全意为人民服务的人生观，对劳动人民有了深厚的阶级感情。参加崇武海战更使我增强了阶级斗争观念。我深深体会到，我的成长过程，就是在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，活学活用“老三篇”的过程，就是在阶级斗争的大风大浪里锻炼成长的过程。大毒草《修养》是培养地主资产阶级少爷小姐的教科书，是产生修正主义的催化剂，是麻醉、毒害人们灵魂的鸦片烟。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，决不上它的当。让党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的《修养》一道见鬼去吧。
    麦贤得的战友、一等功臣陈文乙说：
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是关系到我们国家前途和命运的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大斗争，是夺权和反夺权的大斗争，也是争夺接班人的大斗争。光辉的“老三篇”是无产阶级革命派的座右铭，是无产阶级革命事业接班人的必修课。我们要把无产阶级文化大革命运动作为活学活用毛主席著作、活学活用“老三篇”的大课堂，象张思德那样“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，象白求恩那样“毫不利己专门利人”，象老愚公那样“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”在大革命、大斗争、大批判中锻炼成长，做毛泽东思想的可靠接班人。我们要学习和发扬麦贤得同志的硬骨头精神，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，坚决把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭；坚决把《修养》的毒根彻底挖掉！
