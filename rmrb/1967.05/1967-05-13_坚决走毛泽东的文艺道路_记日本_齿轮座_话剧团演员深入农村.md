A car moves forward on a narrow, winding mountain village road.

The actors of the "Gear Playhouse" theater troupe walked this mountain village road more than ten years ago. That was shortly after the United States launched the Korean War, when the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries were intensifying white terror in Japan and suppressing revolutionary people. A group of young people who were enthusiastic about progressive theater activities organized the "Gear Playhouse." They left the big cities and often performed in remote rural areas and small towns in Yamaguchi Prefecture for workers and peasants.

The revolutionary actions of the "Gear Playhouse" made some revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party very uneasy. They used various means to try to pull the troupe away from the workers and peasants. From then on, these narrow, winding mountain village roads gradually no longer saw the footsteps of the "Gear Playhouse." The performance venues shifted from rural areas and small towns to county and city seats. The performance repertoire changed from modern plays reflecting revolutionary struggles to "big, foreign, and ancient" themes.

Listen to Chairman Mao and Go to the Countryside

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China shook the "Gear Playhouse." Some members who had always insisted on fighting against the revisionist tide gained more confidence and courage to serve the workers and peasants. Those who had been influenced by revisionism also awakened. They all re-studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Chairman Mao said: "Our literary and artistic workers... must shift their position, must move closer to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, must move closer to the actual struggle of the masses, and must move closer to the study of Marxism and the study of society. Only in this way can we have true literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and true proletarian literature and art." Most members of the "Gear Playhouse" decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and "shift their position," firmly walking the path of serving the working people. At this time, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist "authorities" on literature and art came to obstruct them. However, the members of the troupe who insisted on the revolutionary stance united and resolutely fought against the revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party, finally expelling a small group of Japanese Communist Party revisionists from the "Gear Playhouse" in January of this year. During this struggle, a big-character poster was posted within the troupe: "We must go deep into the countryside, live and work with the peasants, and learn from the peasants." This revolutionary initiative immediately received a warm response from all members of the troupe. They decided to take the play "Sprout," which reflects rural struggles and life, to the countryside for rehearsals and revisions, and to perform it first for the peasants.

The actors of the "Gear Playhouse" once again walked the mountain village roads they had walked in the early days of the troupe's founding. They said with great emotion: We are not walking a narrow path now, but the broad path that all revolutionary literary and artistic workers should walk.

Be Humble Students of the Peasants

The actors of the "Gear Playhouse" arrived in the most remote and impoverished mountain village in Yamaguchi Prefecture—Miyafu. However, how to integrate with the peasants and learn from them was a new problem for them. Nevertheless, they had the determination and confidence to do a good job, because each of them carried the Little Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and had studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They firmly believed that as long as they followed Chairman Mao's words, there would be no difficulties they could not overcome.

Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable." He also said: "Only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses." The actors decided to first be students of the peasants, humbly learning from the peasants. During an initial period after arriving in the countryside, they set aside the rehearsals and worked with the peasants all day. Early in the morning, they all went to the fields. Some helped the peasants make charcoal, some went to pound the earth, and some went to tidy up the vegetable garden. The whole village watched them to see if they could really put down their intellectual airs, endure hardship, and bear fatigue.

A peasant couple went out together to take care of some business, and a female actor was left to take care of their home. She saw that the toilet was full of feces, so she took the initiative to carry the bucket and clean it out. Later, the peasant couple returned and found out from a neighbor that it was the actress from the troupe who did it, and they were very moved. From then on, this peasant couple loved the people of the troupe.

Learning the Thoughts and Feelings of the Working People

After initially blending in with the peasants in terms of life and emotions, the actors of the "Gear Playhouse" began to work half a day and rehearse and revise the play for half a day.

Before going down to the countryside, they felt that the play "Sprout," which they were preparing to rehearse, was very good. However, after this period of rural life, they saw with their own eyes and participated in the fierce class struggle in this mountain village, realizing that today's Japanese countryside not only has a struggle between impoverished peasants and the agents of U.S. imperialism, the Sato government, monopolistic capital, and feudal forces, but also a struggle with the revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party. At this point, they felt that the original play was insufficient in this regard. They then set out to enrich and strengthen this red line.

The actors discovered during their life with the peasants that their emotions were very different from those of the working peasants, and that they could not express the image of the working people with such emotions. They felt the urgent need to transform their thoughts and emotions. Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" pointed out: "We literary and artistic workers of intellectual origin must change and transform our thoughts and emotions in order to make our works welcome by the masses. Without this change and transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be out of place." The actors, through practice, had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings. A young female actor summarized her thoughts: "Although I have only lived and worked with the peasants for a period of time, the non-working-class emotions in me cannot be completely eliminated. However, I have gained the confidence to transform myself and have indeed felt the sprouts of working-class emotions growing in me. Therefore, to transform myself, I must continue to go deep into the workers and peasants and unite with them."

The "Gear Playhouse" adopted this method of going down to the countryside, working and rehearsing at the same time, completely breaking the procedures and frameworks of capitalist troupes. In the past, "Gear Playhouse" would take more than a month to rehearse a relatively large play. The bourgeois "authorities" said that a good play could not be rehearsed in such a short time. However, this time they actually only used one-third of the time they needed in the past.

The revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party were extremely hostile to this revolutionary measure of the "Gear Playhouse." They maliciously slandered the "Gear Playhouse" as a "propaganda team for blind followers of the outside," slandered the play "Sprout" as "anti-worker, anti-peasant," and extended their hands of destruction and attack to Miyafu Village, distributing a large number of slanderous leaflets against the "Gear Playhouse" in the village. This vile activity made the peasants of Miyafu Village extremely angry. A few old women indignantly collected these leaflets and returned them to the person in charge of the revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party in the village, and severely condemned their shameful deeds.

Advancing Through Struggle

The actors of the "Gear Playhouse" returned to Yamaguchi City with their enriched thoughts and newly rehearsed play, and began performances in nearby towns.

A worker in Shimoniwa City, after watching the play, said: "A few years ago, I watched one of your plays, which was about the ancient Greek fable of Aesop. This time I came to see your performance again and saw a play reflecting the oppression and exploitation of today's impoverished Japanese peasants, their awakening, and their struggle. Your direction has changed for the better, and this path is correct. I hope you will overcome difficulties and continue."

An audience member in Ube watched the play and then wanted to read the script, then wrote a letter to the "Gear Playhouse," enthusiastically praising them for taking a big step on the road of uniting with the workers and peasants.

The actors were inspired by the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of viewers, and their confidence was strengthened. A responsible person from the "Gear Playhouse" said: "Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' is our guide to action. It is Mao Zedong Thought that made us see through the anti-people nature of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist literary line and achieved victory in the long struggle against the capitalist and revisionist lines. Although the revisionist members of the Japanese Communist Party and the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries strongly oppose and sabotage us, we will not waver and will continue to firmly advance along the literary and artistic direction indicated by Chairman Mao!"

    坚决走毛泽东的文艺道路
    ——记日本“齿轮座”话剧团演员深入农村
    汽车在狭窄、弯曲的山村小路上前进。
    “齿轮座”话剧团的演员们，十多年前，走过这条山村小路。那是在美国发动侵略朝鲜战争后不久，美日反动派在日本加紧实行白色恐怖、镇压革命人民的时期。一批热心从事进步话剧活动的青年，组织了“齿轮座”。他们离开大城市，经常活动在山口县的一些偏僻农村、城镇，为工农演出。
    “齿轮座”的革命行动使当时的一些日共修正主义分子大为不安。他们通过各种办法千方百计地把剧团拉到脱离工农的道路上。自此以后，渐渐地这些狭窄、弯曲的山村小路上，就看不见“齿轮座”的足迹了。演出场所从农村、小镇，转至县城、市镇。演出节目从反映革命斗争的现代戏，变成了“大、洋、古”。
    听毛主席的话到农村去
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，震动了“齿轮座”。一些从来坚持与修正主义逆流进行斗争的成员，增加了为工农服务的信心和勇气，曾经接受了修正主义影响的人，也猛醒过来。他们一起重新学习了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。毛主席说：“我们的文艺工作者……，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”“齿轮座”的大多数成员都决心按着毛主席的教导，“把立足点移过来”，坚定地走为工农劳动群众服务的道路。这时，日共修正主义“文艺权威”又来阻挠他们了。但是，坚持革命立场的话剧团成员，团结起来，毅然地同日共修正主义分子展开了斗争，终于在今年一月把一小撮日共修正主义分子赶出“齿轮座”。在这场斗争中，团内贴出了一张大字报：“我们要深入农村，与农民同吃同住同劳动，向农民学习。”这项革命的倡议立即得到全体团员的热烈响应。他们决定把准备演出的反映农村斗争和生活的话剧《发芽》，拿到农村去排练、修改，并且首先为农民演出。
    “齿轮座”的演员们，又重新走上了“齿轮座”创建初期走过的山村小路。他们无比激动地说：我们现在走的并不是一条狭窄的小路，而是一切革命的文艺工作者应当走的宽广大路。
    甘当农民的小学生
    “齿轮座”的演员来到了山口县最偏僻、最贫穷的山村——弥富。可是，究竟怎样与农民结合、怎样向农民学习？对他们都是新问题。然而他们有决心和有信心搞好，因为他们每个人都带着红色宝书《毛主席语录》，都学习过毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，他们坚信，只要照毛主席的话办事，没有克服不了的困难。
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。还说：“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。”演员们决心首先做农民的学生，虚心向农民学习。在刚到农村的一个期间内，他们把排戏的事放在一旁，全天与农民一起参加劳动。一清早，他们就都下地了。有的帮助农民烧炭，有的去打夯，有的去收拾菜地。全村的人都注视着他们，看他们是否真能象自己说的那样，放得下知识分子的架子，吃得起苦，挨得了累。
    有一家农民夫妇一起外出办事，一个女演员给他们看家。她看见厕所粪便满了，便主动扛起粪桶给掏净了。后来，这家农民回来发觉后，从邻居嘴里打听到是剧团那个女演员做的，非常感动。从此，这家农民就爱上了这个剧团的人。
    学习劳动人民思想感情
    在同农民生活、感情上初步打成一片之后，“齿轮座”的演员们开始半天劳动，半天排戏、改戏。
    在下乡之前，他们第一次看到准备排演的剧本《发芽》时，感到很好。但是经过这一时期的农村生活，由于他们亲眼看见了、并参加了这个山村的激烈的阶级斗争，认识到今天日本的农村不仅有贫苦农民同美帝国主义代理人佐藤政府和垄断资本以及封建势力的斗争，还有同日共修正主义分子的斗争。这时，才感到原作在这方面表现很不够。他们便着手充实、加强这条红线。
    演员们在同农民一起生活中，发现自己的感情有许多同劳动农民不一样，用这种感情不可能表现出劳动人民的形象，感到迫切需要改造自己的思想和感情。毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中指出：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”演员们在实践中，对毛主席的这一教导又有了进一步的体会。一位女青年演员总结自己的思想收获说：“虽然仅仅通过一个时期同农民一起生活和劳动，我身上的非劳动人民的感情，还不能全部改掉，但是自己却有了进行改造的信心，也确实感到了在自己身上劳动人民感情的萌芽正在成长。因此，要改造自己就应当继续深入工农，与工农相结合。”
    “齿轮座”采取这种下乡边劳动边排戏的方法，完全打破了资本主义剧团排戏的程序和框子。过去“齿轮座”排一个比较大的戏，要用一个多月的时间，资产阶级的“权威”说，不用那么长的时间就排不出好戏。可是，这次他们实际排戏时间只用了过去需要时间的三分之一。
    日共修正主义分子对“齿轮座”这一革命性的措施，无比仇视，他们大肆诬蔑“齿轮座”是“对外盲从分子的宣传队”，诬蔑话剧《发芽》是“反工人、反农民”的之外，还把破坏、打击“齿轮座”的黑手伸到弥富村，在村里大量散发诽谤“齿轮座”的传单。这种丑恶的活动使弥富村的农民极为愤怒。有几位老大娘气愤地把这些传单收集起来，退给村内日共修正主义分子负责人，并严厉地谴责了它们的这种可耻勾当。
    在斗争中前进
    “齿轮座”的演员们，带着思想上的丰收，带着新排好的剧，返回山口市，并开始在附近城镇演出。
    下关市的一位工人观众看过这个剧之后说：“几年前，我看过一次你们的戏，那是演的古希腊伊索的故事。这次我又来看你们的公演，看到了反映今天日本贫苦农民受压迫、受剥削，觉醒起来，进行斗争的戏。你们的这个大方向改得好，这条路走得对，希望你们克服困难坚持下去。”
    宇部的一位观众看过戏后，又要去剧本阅读，然后给“齿轮座”写了一封信，热情赞扬他们在与工农结合的道路上迈出一大步。
    演员们从广大观众热情支持的反映中受到鼓舞，坚定了他们的信心。“齿轮座”一位负责人说：“毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是我们行动的指南。是毛泽东思想使我们认清了日共修正主义文艺路线的反人民本质，在长期的反对资本主义、修正主义路线斗争中取得了胜利。虽然日共修正主义分子和美日反动派极力反对和破坏我们，但是我们决不动摇，要继续坚定地沿着毛主席指出的文艺方向前进！”
