We, the warriors of the "East is Red" commune at the Beijing Institute of Geology, are filled with revolutionary ardor and have watched the heart-stirring film "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army."

Last October, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, in green military uniform, once again reviewed the Red Guards and revolutionary students from all over the country during the high tide of the mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line. This is our greatest happiness, the greatest encouragement! How can we forget that moving scene? How can we forget that moment of happiness! Wherever Chairman Mao appears, there is a roaring sea of cheers, a vast ocean of red waves. We shout and sing a thousand times, a million times, condensing it into the loudest words: Long live Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts!

After watching the film, the scenes of our arduous struggles floated before our eyes again.

In early June last year, we responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, raised the banner of "Rebellion is justified," and fired thousands of big-character posters like cannons at the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road in our school.

However, the class enemies are not willing to perish. The more they are on the verge of destruction, the more they struggle desperately. At this time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was flourishing, the number one power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road formulated a bourgeois reactionary line to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and launched one savage counterattack after another against us proletarian revolutionaries. With the support of the number one power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road, the handful of power-holders within our school who were taking the capitalist road labeled the revolutionary comrade who posted the first big-character poster as a "rightist" and a "counter-revolutionary," and cursed us as "clouds that cannot cover the sun"; then, they launched a "counter-interference" wind. Standing on the bourgeois reactionary position, they frantically encircled the revolutionary forces, attempting to strangle the new revolutionary forces.

"Gazing at the Big Dipper, longing for Chairman Mao in my heart." In the midst of the poisonous flames and demonic fog of the bourgeois reactionary line, in the days of white terror created by the number one power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road, we warriors of the "East is Red" commune at the Beijing Institute of Geology, like revolutionary comrades across the country, longed for Chairman Mao so much! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! When lost, we think of you for direction; when in difficulty, we think of you for strength! In the high tide of mass criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, you reviewed us again, which was an encouragement, a whip, a call, and a command. Under the encouragement of Chairman Mao, we pushed the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line to a new high tide.

Dear Chairman Mao, you support us, and we will make you proud! We will definitely achieve new merits and create new achievements in the struggle to criticize the number one power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road; we will definitely thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few" in the issue of cadres; we will criticize and eliminate the ideological and theoretical foundations of the bourgeois reactionary line. We will also, while transforming the objective world, transform our subjective world, seize the power of the "self" in our minds, and continuously strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of our ranks, and in the storms of class struggle, cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    抬头仰望北斗星，日夜想念毛主席
    北京地质学院东方红公社　林瑞
    我们地质学院“东方红”战士，满怀革命的壮志豪情，观看了动人心弦的影片《毛主席第五、第六次检阅文化革命大军》。
    去年十月，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，在群众性批判资产阶级反动路线的高潮中，身穿绿军装，又一次检阅了来自五湖四海的红卫兵小将和革命师生。这是我们最大的幸福，是对我们最大的鼓舞！我们怎么能忘记那激动人心的场面，我们怎么能忘记那幸福的时刻！毛主席出现在那儿，那儿就是一片沸腾的欢呼，那儿就是一片红浪翻滚的海洋。我们千遍万遍地呼喊，千声万声地歌唱，凝为一句最响亮的语言：祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！
    看了影片，一幕幕艰苦斗争的经历，又浮现在我们的眼前。
    去年六月初，我们响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，高举“造反有理”的大旗，千万张排炮般的大字报，射向学校党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    但是，阶级敌人是不甘心灭亡的。他们越是濒于灭亡，就越要进行垂死挣扎。就在这无产阶级文化大革命蓬勃开展的时候，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派制定了一条抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的资产阶级反动路线，向我们无产阶级革命派发动了一次又一次猖狂的反扑。由于有党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持，我校党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派把贴第一张大字报的革命同学打成“右派”“反革命”，并且破口大骂我们是“遮不住太阳的乌云”；接着，他们又掀起了一股“反干扰”的妖风。他们站在资产阶级反动立场上，疯狂地围剿革命派，妄图扼杀新生的革命力量。
      “抬头仰望北斗星，心中想念毛主席”。在资产阶级反动路线的毒焰妖雾中，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所制造的白色恐怖的日子里，我们地质学院“东方红”战士和全国各地无产阶级革命派战士一样，是多么想念毛主席他老人家啊！毛主席啊，毛主席！迷路时想起您有方向，困难时想起您添力量！在对资产阶级反动路线进行群众性大批判的高潮中，您又一次检阅我们，对我们是鼓舞，是鞭策，是号召，是命令。在毛主席的鼓励下，我们把对资产阶级反动路线的批判推向了一个更新的高潮。
    敬爱的毛主席，您给我们撑腰，我们给您争气！我们一定要在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，创新功，建新劳；我们一定要彻底批判干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线；批臭《修养》，坚决铲除资产阶级反动路线的思想基础和理论基础。我们还要在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，夺头脑里“私”字的权，不断地加强我们队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，在阶级斗争的风雨中，把自己培养成无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
