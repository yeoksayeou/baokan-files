	Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Meets Syrian Foreign Minister to Condemn U.S. Imperialist Aggression
	Seven Hundred Million Chinese People Stand with the Syrian People

	BEIRUT, May 25 -- Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Yu Jun met with Syrian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Ibrahim Makhous on May 25, representing the Chinese government and people to firmly support the Syrian people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and Zionism.

	Yu Jun said: The U.S. imperialists, who are rampant everywhere, are the vicious enemy of the people of the world and the Arab people. The U.S. imperialists instigate Israel and even personally take action, constantly invading, threatening, and sabotaging Syria and Arab countries. The Chinese government and people believe that the Syrian people, with their glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will certainly smash the U.S. and Israeli aggression plots.

	Yu Jun said: The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, teaches us that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Yu Jun continued, as long as the Arab people strengthen their unity, persist in their struggle, and be vigilant against the plots of imperialists and reactionaries, the aggression plots of the U.S. and its tool, Israel, will definitely be defeated.

	He said: Seven hundred million Chinese people are the most reliable and steadfast friends of the Syrian people. In the common struggle against U.S. imperialism, the Chinese people will, as always, stand firmly with the Syrian people.

	Makhous said: The current struggle of the Arab people is part of the global struggle against U.S. imperialism. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the great and heroic Chinese people have always supported us. The Chinese people are forever the reliable and steadfast friends of the Syrian and Arab people.

	Makhous condemned the U.S., Britain, and Israel for their armed threats against the Arab people, and the U.S. using the United Nations to serve its aggression plots. He said: We will use force to counter force and resolutely fight back against U.S. aggression. The U.S. paper tiger will surely suffer a heavy blow from the Arab people.

    我临时代办会见叙外长谴责美帝侵略
    七亿中国人民同叙利亚人民站在一起
    新华社大马士革二十五日电　中国驻叙利亚大使馆临时代办于俊二十五日会见了叙利亚副总理兼外交部长易卜拉欣·马胡斯，代表中国政府和人民表示坚决支持叙利亚人民反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争。
    于俊说：到处横行霸道的美帝国主义，是全世界人民和阿拉伯人民的凶恶敌人。美帝国主义唆使以色列甚至亲自出马，不断对叙利亚和阿拉伯国家进行侵略威胁和破坏活动。中国政府和人民相信，具有反帝斗争光荣传统的叙利亚人民，必将粉碎美国和以色列的侵略阴谋。
    于俊说：中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。于俊接着说，只要阿拉伯人民加强团结，坚持斗争，警惕帝国主义和反动派的阴谋，美国及其工具以色列的侵略阴谋最后一定会被击败的。
    他说：七亿中国人民是叙利亚人民最忠实的可靠朋友。在反对美帝国主义的共同斗争中，中国人民将一如既往，坚定不移地同叙利亚人民站在一起。
    马胡斯说：阿拉伯人民当前的斗争，是全世界反对美帝国主义共同斗争的一部分。毛主席领导下的伟大的、英雄的中国人民过去一贯支持我们。中国人民永远是叙利亚人民和阿拉伯人民的忠实的可靠朋友。
    马胡斯谴责美国、英国和以色列对阿拉伯人民进行武装威胁，美国并用联合国来为它的侵略阴谋效劳。他说：我们将用武力来对付武力，坚决反击美国的侵略。美国这只纸老虎定将遭到阿拉伯人民的沉重打击。
