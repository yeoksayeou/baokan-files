On the eve of International Labor Day, a Lao friend, filled with immense excitement, wrote a poem to enthusiastically praise the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. He expressed his determination to study Mao Zedong Thought together with workers from all over the world. Workers of the world, let us join forces to oppose the imperialist devil, completely eliminate it, and bring happiness and peace to all humanity. Marx once taught us: "Workers of the world, unite!" To defeat the imperialist devil, we must unite and fight bravely. Lenin also taught us that to reclaim our rights and thoroughly eliminate all harmful elements, we must unite and struggle together. The great leader of our time, Mao Zedong, has developed Marxism-Leninism, making it shine like a jewel, rising like the morning sun with boundless radiance, guiding us on the path to victory. Comrades, let us follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, study, temper ourselves, and transform our thoughts to align with Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao's thoughts are the red sun, shining brightly and powerfully. They are also the embodiment of truth and noble morality. Comrades, let it take deep root in our hearts.

    让毛泽东思想在我们心中扎根
   “五一”国际劳动节前夕，一位老挝朋友怀着无比激动的心情，写了一首诗，热情地歌颂光辉的毛泽东思想，并且表示要同全世界的工人一起努力学习毛泽东思想。全世界的工人兄弟们，共同努力反对帝国主义恶魔，把它彻底消灭，为全人类带来幸福和安宁。马克思曾教导我们：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”为了战胜帝国主义恶魔，我们要齐心合力，奋勇斗争。列宁也曾教导我们，为了夺回我们的权利，彻底清除一切害人虫，必须联合起来，共同奋斗。当代伟大的领袖毛泽东，发展了马克思列宁主义理论，使它象宝石一般闪闪发光，如旭日东升，光芒万丈，给我们指出了通往胜利的道路。全体工人弟兄，让我们遵照毛伯伯的教导，全心全意地学习、锻炼和改造，使自己的思想符合毛伯伯的教导。毛伯伯的思想是红太阳，光芒四射，威力无穷。它也是真理和高尚道德的结晶，弟兄们，让它在我们的心坎里深深
  扎根。
