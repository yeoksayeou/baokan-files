Our great leader Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published twenty-five years ago. Over these twenty-five years, the rich practice of the proletarian literary and artistic movement in China and internationally has powerfully proven that Chairman Mao's brilliant, genius work is a universal truth applicable everywhere. It is the most complete, most comprehensive, and most systematic Marxist-Leninist theory of literature and art. Its rain and sunshine have directly nurtured China's revolutionary literary and artistic troops. As a Chinese revolutionary literary and artistic worker, how could one not feel the greatest happiness and honor!

Today, as the entire nation launches a great criticism against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the "Talks" has even deeper political significance.

For many years, the struggle between the two classes and two lines on the literary and artistic front has been fiercely waged. Supporting or opposing the "Talks" is the dividing line between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary literary and artistic workers. Based on profound historical lessons, those who follow the "Talks" can advance along the correct path, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. Conversely, they will surely make mistakes, become captives of the revisionist literary line, and even degenerate into traitors of the people.

I am a musician and a composer of mass songs. Over the past decade, I have witnessed the struggle between the two classes and two lines in the music world. This struggle has always been fiercely waged around the question of whom to sing for and whom to sing about. The core issue is: should we sing in praise of or in opposition to our reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and should we sing in praise of or in opposition to the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao taught us in the "Talks": "The question of for whom is a fundamental and principled question." He also said: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Comrade Lin Biao said: "All our achievements and victories are attained under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, and are victories of Mao Zedong Thought." Therefore, when we sing of the greatness of the Party, the strength of the motherland, the wisdom of the laboring people, and the bravery of the soldiers, we must first sing in praise of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, in a socialist society, there is always a struggle between capitalist restoration and proletarian opposition to capitalist restoration. Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful weapon to smash capitalist restoration and consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and consolidating proletarian dictatorship is to defend the class interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In short, if we do not sing of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we cannot talk about serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have an infinite love for our great leader Chairman Mao and an infinite faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Gathering the deep feelings of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought into musical compositions is our solemn and sublime task as revolutionary musicians.

Last year, I went to the earthquake-stricken area of Xingtai, Hebei Province. Passing through Beijing, a responsible person from the Chinese Musicians Association told me: "What they need there now is material support. What use is it for you to go and sing? Besides, people won't be in the mood to sing." However, upon arriving in the disaster area, the first thing I heard was the song "The Boat Needs a Helmsman," and everywhere I saw were Chairman Mao's quotations such as "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, surmounting all difficulties, and striving for victory." We heard many moving stories of the poor and lower-middle peasants' love for Chairman Mao in the disaster area. We wrote songs like "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao" and "Chairman Mao Sent the Liberation Army." During the creation process, many masses bluntly gave us revision suggestions, and even children around ten years old could offer good ideas. After we finished writing, we taught and performed the songs everywhere, and they were welcomed by the masses. Sometimes, before we finished singing a song, they would shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" The masses were so moved because our songs sang of our most beloved great leader and expressed their feelings. We felt the utmost honor in creating a song that the workers, peasants, and soldiers welcomed and that praised Chairman Mao.

However, the old Propaganda Department and the old Cultural Department, backed by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, have always opposed singing of our reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in song creation. They blew cold winds and poured cold water on the songs created by the masses that praised Chairman Mao. They also imposed many rules on us, such as not writing about "savior" and "kindness," especially restricting us from writing that Chairman Mao is the leader of the world's people and that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. We say that Chairman Mao is the people's great savior, that Chairman Mao's kindness is deeper than the sea, and that Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all the people of the world.

Chairman Mao's poems are the greatest revolutionary poems in human history and are loved by the workers, peasants, and soldiers of our country and revolutionary people all over the world. Composing music for Chairman Mao's poems is a serious and glorious political task for both amateur and professional revolutionary musicians. However, those counter-revolutionary revisionists, using "peasants don't understand" as an excuse, opposed people's creation, opposed the publication and performance of songs based on Chairman Mao's poems.

They view revolutionary songs as thorns in their eyes and use every means to suppress and exclude revolutionary song creation. They wielded sticks labeled "formulaic," "conceptual," "slogans," "dry," "rigid," and "completing tasks" at revolutionary songs. In reality, they opposed the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought in revolutionary songs, fearing that revolutionary songs would become battle cries to inspire the people's fighting spirit and become powerful weapons for "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic world, on the one hand, opposed singing of the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in songs, and on the other hand, vigorously promoted and advocated bourgeois music. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party once personally promoted the infamous songs from the 1930s, "The Sparrow and the Child" and "The Grape Fairy," treating them as the tradition of Chinese new operas. During the three consecutive years of natural disasters in our country, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mohan vigorously advocated for "resting music," criticizing our country's radio music programs for not being as diverse as those of Japanese bourgeois radio stations. These schemers with hidden agendas do not allow us to sing of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, but instead make people sing praises of emperors, generals, talented scholars, beautiful women, and ghosts and monsters. How malicious their intentions are!

Chairman Mao pointed out in the "Talks": "If you are a bourgeois literary and artistic worker, you will not sing of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian literary and artistic worker, you will not sing of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the laboring people." Despite the opposition of the heads of the underworld, because our people love Chairman Mao, thousands upon thousands of people in factories, villages, and the army compose songs for Chairman Mao every day. Currently, the songs about Chairman Mao circulating among the masses are mostly written by amateur authors or those deemed by the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the music world as the "two-thirds faction" and the "Arabic numerals faction" — the "little people."

In my process of musical creation, I deeply felt how great and profound the guidance of Chairman Mao's "Talks" is. From an ordinary junior high school student to now being able to do some work for the masses, this is entirely the result of Chairman Mao's cultivation. It is he who pointed out to us the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers; it is he who pointed out to us that literary and artistic workers must, through learning Marxism and deepening their understanding of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, shift their standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the side of the proletariat. Under the domination of the revisionist literary black line, due to not studying Chairman Mao's works well and having a weak class struggle consciousness, I was influenced by revisionist literary thoughts and made some mistakes in my work, which is a lesson to be learned forever. I am determined, in the class struggle, to study and apply the "Talks" actively, to study Chairman Mao's works for a lifetime, to reform my thoughts for a lifetime, to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought in my mind, to advance bravely along Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and to sing loudly with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers of our reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and of the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    放声歌唱我们心中最红的红太阳
    劫夫
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，已经发表二十五年了。在这二十五年间，我国和国际无产阶级文艺运动的丰富实践，有力地证明：毛主席这篇光辉的天才著作是放之四海而皆准的真理，它是最完整、最全面、最系统的马克思列宁主义文艺理论。它的雨露和阳光直接哺育了我国的革命的文艺队伍，作为一个中国的革命文艺工作者，怎能不感到最大的幸福和光荣！
    今天，正当全国人民向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开大批判的时候，纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，更具有深刻的政治意义。
    多少年来，文艺战线上两个阶级、两条路线的斗争一直在激烈地进行着。拥护或反对《讲话》，是区别文艺工作者革命或反革命的分水岭。根据历史的深刻教训，凡是照《讲话》办事的，就能沿着正确的道路前进，为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务。反之，则一定会犯错误，成为修正主义文艺路线的俘虏，以至堕落为人民的罪人。
    我是一个音乐工作者，一个群众歌曲作者。十多年来，身经目睹了音乐界的两个阶级、两条路线的斗争。这个斗争一直是围绕着为谁歌唱、歌唱谁的问题而激烈地进行着。问题的中心是：歌颂还是反对歌唱我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂还是反对歌唱毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众。
    毛主席在《讲话》中教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”又说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    林彪同志说：“我们的一切成就、一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”因此，我们歌唱党的伟大、祖国的强盛、劳动人民的智慧、战士的勇敢，都必须首先歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想。同时，在社会主义社会里，始终存在着资本主义复辟和无产阶级反资本主义复辟的斗争。毛泽东思想是我们粉碎资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政的最强大的武器，而巩固无产阶级专政，就是保卫工农兵的阶级利益。总之，如果不歌唱毛主席和毛泽东思想，就根本谈不上为工农兵服务。广大的工农兵群众无限热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，无限信仰战无不胜的毛泽东思想。把工农兵群众对毛主席和毛泽东思想热爱的深厚情感，聚集在乐章中，这是我们革命音乐工作者庄严而崇高的任务。
    去年，我到河北省邢台地震灾区去。路过北京，中国音协某负责人对我说：“那里现在需要的是物质支援，你们去唱歌有什么用，而且人们也不会有心情唱歌。”但是一到灾区，我首先听到的就是《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声，到处看到的是“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”等毛主席语录。我们在灾区到处都可以听到贫下中农热爱毛主席的感人故事。我们写出了《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》《毛主席派来了解放军》等歌曲。在创作过程中，好多群众不客气地给我们提出修改意见，连十来岁的小孩也能提出很好的意见。我们写好了以后，就到处教唱和表演，这些歌曲受到了群众的欢迎。他们有时不等你唱完一支歌曲，就高呼“毛主席万岁！”群众为什么这样感动？我们的歌曲写得很粗糙，我们也没有动听的歌喉，只是因为这些歌曲歌唱了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖，唱出了他们的心声。我们以创作出一首为工农兵欢迎的歌颂毛主席的歌曲而感到无尚的荣耀。
    但是，旧中宣部、旧文化部的阎王老爷们，在他们的总后台、党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的支持下，却一向反对在歌曲创作中歌唱我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们对群众创作出来的歌颂毛主席的歌曲，吹冷风、泼冷水。他们还给我们规定许多清规戒律，如不要写“救星”和“恩情”，特别限制我们写毛主席是世界人民的领袖，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义顶峰这样的内容。我们说毛主席就是人民的大救星，毛主席的恩情就是比海深，毛主席就是全世界人民心中的红太阳。
    毛主席的诗词是人类历史上最伟大的革命诗章，受到了我国工农兵群众和全世界革命人民的热爱。为毛主席诗词谱曲是我们业余和专业的革命音乐工作者的严肃而光荣的政治任务。可是那些反革命修正主义分子，却以“农民不懂”为口实，反对人们进行创作，反对出版和演唱毛主席诗词歌曲。
    他们把革命歌曲看作眼中钉，千方百计地打击、排斥革命歌曲创作，什么“公式化”“概念化”“标语口号”“干巴巴”“硬梆梆”“赶任务”等大棒都打在革命歌曲的头上。实际上他们反对的就是在革命歌曲里宣传毛泽东思想，害怕革命歌曲成为鼓舞人民斗志的战斗号角，成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一方面反对歌曲歌颂毛主席和毛泽东思想，一方面又竭力推崇和提倡资产阶级音乐。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就曾经亲自出马推崇臭名远扬的三十年代的《麻雀与小孩》《葡萄仙子》，把它们当作中国新歌剧的传统。在我国遭受连续三年自然灾害时期，反革命修正主义分子林默涵竭力提倡大写“休息的音乐”，他指责我国电台音乐节目没有日本资产阶级电台的音乐多样化。这些包藏祸心的阴谋家，不让我们歌唱最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，而专门叫人颂扬帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神，其用心何其毒也。
    毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民”。尽管那些阎王殿的头目们反对歌唱伟大领袖毛主席，但是由于我国人民热爱毛主席，每天都有成千上万的人在工厂、农村、部队中为毛主席谱写颂歌。目前在群众中流传的歌唱毛主席的歌曲，大都是业余作者或者被音乐界反革命修正主义分子贬之为“四分之二派”和“阿拉伯数字派”的“小人物”写出来的。
    在我从事音乐创作的过程中，我深刻地体会到，毛主席的《讲话》对我们的教益是多么巨大，多么深刻。我从一个普通初中学生到现在多少能为群众做一些工作，这完全是毛主席培养的结果。是他老人家向我们指出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向；是他老人家向我们指出文艺工作者必须在学习马克思主义和深入工农兵的过程中把立足点移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。在修正主义文艺黑线的统治下，我由于毛主席著作学得不好，阶级斗争观念薄弱，受到修正主义文艺思想的影响，在工作中犯了一些错误，这是要永远引以为教训的。我决心在阶级斗争中，活学活用《讲话》，学一辈子毛主席的著作，改造一辈子思想，在头脑里树立起毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威，沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线奋勇前进，和广大工农兵一起放声歌唱我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席，歌唱战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌唱毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵群众！
