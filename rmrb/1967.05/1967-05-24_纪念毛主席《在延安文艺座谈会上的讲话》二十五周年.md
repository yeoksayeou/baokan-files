Comrades,

The world is now entering a completely new historical era. This is an era where the workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters, an era where Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner.

Twenty-five years ago, our great teacher Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" heralded the arrival of a new era where the workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters, which would soon come to all of China and, through different processes, to all countries in the world.

Mao Zedong's great work is a summary of a major debate that took place twenty-five years ago on the issue of literature and art, which in essence was a political issue. It was a summary of a major debate on the fundamental political question of whether to affirm or negate the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

This great work is our party's declaration for transforming the party and the world according to the image of the vanguard of the proletariat. It solves the problem of worldview for all those who want to be revolutionaries of the proletariat. It solves the problem of whether many Communist Party members have joined the party in thought as well as in organization. It points out the brilliant path for all Communist Party members and revolutionaries to unite with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

This great work does not limit itself to the issue of literature and art, but it is a summary of the experience of the struggle in literature and art from the perspective of the proletariat's worldview. It is the first comprehensive solution to the issue of literature and art in history, a thorough revolution in literature and art from the perspective of Marxism-Leninism, and it has become the guiding principle and manifesto for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

In essence, this great work has also become the ideological weapon for the oppressed classes and peoples of the world to engage in a great political struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. It has become the battle cry for revolutionaries of various countries to advance in thought and politics against imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries.

In a letter about the revolution of Peking Opera, Mao Zedong said: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (and in all literature and art that is divorced from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, ruled by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies." Mao Zedong believed that this inversion of history must now be inverted again.

The working people who create history, the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed by the workers and peasants, must occupy the political stage and the stage of economic life, and must also occupy the stage of literature and art. This is Mao Zedong's conclusion.

In class society, the struggle on the cultural and ideological front, including the struggle on the literary and artistic front, is no exception to class struggle, a form of class struggle.

As Marx and Engels said in the "Communist Manifesto," all class struggles are political struggles.

Mao Zedong thoroughly threw out all the rotten and reactionary talk of the bourgeoisie about being above classes and above politics. Mao Zedong thoroughly criticized Trotsky's reactionary view of "politics—Marxism; art—bourgeoisie" dualism or pluralism. Mao Zedong believed that there is no such thing as politics above classes, nor is there any literature and art independent of class politics. Mao Zedong consistently expounded a monistic proletarian cosmology on all issues, and on the issue of literature and art. He correctly said, "All culture or literature and art belongs to a certain class, belongs to a certain political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel to or independent of politics, in fact, does not exist."

Mao Zedong developed Lenin's point on the party's literature. He pointed out that all revolutionary writers, if they truly want to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the revolutionary people, must implement the correct proletarian political line of our party and must stand on the proletarian standpoint.

It is clear that all revolutionary writers, if they do not implement the correct proletarian political line of the party and do not strive to stand on the proletarian worldview, will not approach the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, will not participate in the actual revolutionary struggle of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. As a result, they will not be able to correctly portray the workers, peasants, and soldiers, nor will they be able to correctly educate the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and will instead go against the cause of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Mao Zedong told us: "Proletarian literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat." "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they also exert a great influence on politics." The action of proletarian politics on literature and art and the reaction of proletarian literature and art on proletarian politics must go through a long period, through a long period of proletarian struggle to revolutionary victory, through a long period of proletarian dictatorship.

The appearance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is not accidental. The proletarian revolution has been victorious, and proletarian dictatorship has been realized, but we must not underestimate the influence of the landlord bourgeoisie. As Mao Zedong has repeatedly instructed, in a socialist society, there are still classes, class struggle, and the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, between the socialist and capitalist roads.

The struggle to defend the fruits of the proletarian revolution and to oppose capitalist restoration is very serious. The landlord bourgeoisie has lost political power and feudal and capitalist ownership, but they still have strength on the cultural, ideological, and literary and artistic fronts. Their literature and art, which have a long history and strongly express their exploiting class nature, still have a market among the masses. Under the leadership of the proletariat, after the laboring masses have overthrown the rule of the landlord bourgeoisie and international capitalist forces, they cannot immediately shake off the cultural, ideological, and literary and artistic influences that have been formed over a long period. The landlord bourgeoisie, closely linked with international capitalist forces, are doing everything they can to maintain these positions, consolidate these positions, and seize these positions to corrupt our masses and revolutionary cadres. They want to use the method of peaceful evolution to allow the international imperialist forces that enslave our people to return, to turn our proletarian dictatorship back into the dictatorship of the landlord bourgeoisie, to turn our socialist state property and collective property back into their blood-sucking property, to oppress the people again, to exploit the people again, and to put the people back into misery.

In this period when the landlord bourgeoisie and international capitalist forces are still dreaming of restoring their paradise, the petty bourgeoisie will continue to produce new bourgeoisie. The vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie is very serious. The landlord bourgeoisie always try to use the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie, and always try to use the vacillation of bourgeois intellectuals, many cultural workers, ideological workers, and literary and artistic workers, to seize our cultural, ideological, and literary and artistic positions, to create convenience for their counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Indeed, on the ideological and literary and artistic fronts, some positions are unchanged, and some have been seized.

Comrade Jiang Qing has always insisted on and defended Chairman Mao's line of literary and artistic revolution. She is the vanguard. In recent years, she has made a series of revolutionary models in drama, music, and dance, driving the monsters and ghosts off the literary and artistic stage and establishing the heroic images of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many literary and artistic workers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, together with Comrade Jiang Qing, have become pioneers in the literary and artistic revolution. Moreover, many revolutionary cultural workers and ideological workers have made important efforts on these fronts to oppose capitalist restoration, which is also very clear.

When the proletariat has not yet seized political power, revolutionary cultural workers, ideological workers, and literary and artistic workers serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers in life-and-death struggles, aiming to go through different revolutionary stages (from the democratic revolutionary stage to the socialist revolutionary stage) to win the victory of the proletariat and seize proletarian political power. After the proletariat has seized political power, under proletarian dictatorship, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, cultural workers, and ideological workers serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, aiming to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and advance socialism in the continuing revolution.

After the proletariat has seized political power, whether it can maintain this power, consolidate this power, and strengthen this power is a very practical and fundamental question facing us.

On the eve of national liberation in 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward to the whole party that we must prevent the enemy's attack with sugar-coated bullets.

Comrade Mao Zedong's foresight is truly scientific and very wise.

The enemy's sugar-coated bullets come in various forms. They are very good at using things like "literature and art" as sugar-coated bullets. The bourgeoisie wants to use the old ideology, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting class to "conquer people's hearts," thereby weakening proletarian dictatorship and paving the way for counter-revolutionary restoration.

At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962, Comrade Mao Zedong, in view of the actual situation of the party's biggest capitalist-roader in power pushing the single-line wind, specially and emphatically raised the theoretical question of the existence of classes, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society. At the same time, he pointed out: To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and first do ideological work. This is true for revolutionary classes and also for counter-revolutionary classes.

It can be said that revolutionary or counter-revolutionary classes always regard the creation of public opinion as preparation for seizing power. This is an important historical law expounded by Comrade Mao Zedong. The history of class struggle, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, has been no exception.

This "preparation of public opinion" includes literature and art.

After national liberation, Comrade Mao Zedong has always been concerned with the problem of the proletarian cultural revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong has always linked the struggles of the proletariat on the political front, economic front, and cultural and ideological front. Over the past seventeen years, all major issues on the cultural and ideological front, from criticizing the treacherous "The Palace of Desire," the slavish "Wu Xun's Biography," and the idealist "Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber," have been raised by Comrade Mao Zedong. Now, it is very necessary for us to re-study "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Comrade Mao Zedong's series of fighting documents on ideological and literary and artistic issues. Comrade Mao Zedong's series of documents after national liberation are to remind everyone to pay attention to eliminating the influence of the habits and forces of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, and ultimately to prevent capitalist restoration and consolidate proletarian dictatorship.

All sincere Communist Party members, if they take ideological and literary and artistic issues lightly, if they slightly neglect Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on these issues, will commit serious political errors, may slide into the bourgeoisie's swamp in politics, may gradually change in politics and become counter-revolutionary revisionists like the Khrushchev group in the Soviet Union, may collude with the bourgeoisie's representatives who have infiltrated the party, using various tricks to carry out counter-revolutionary capitalist restoration.

Isn't all this ruthlessly exposed and proven by the facts? Yes, it is exactly like this.

Comrade Mao Zedong keeps sounding the alarm.

In December 1963, Comrade Mao Zedong severely criticized the weaknesses in the field of art in our country, pointing out that a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party "enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art, but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist art," which is a "strange thing." He said:

	All kinds of art forms—drama, storytelling, music, fine arts, dance, film,
	poetry, and literature, etc., have many problems, many people, and the
	socialist transformation in many departments has so far been ineffective.
	Many departments are still ruled by the "dead." We cannot underestimate
	the achievements of film, new poetry, folk songs, fine arts, and novels,
	but there are also many problems. As for the departments of drama, etc.,
	the problems are even greater. The social and economic base has changed,
	but one of the superstructures serving this base, the art departments,
	still has big problems. This requires starting from investigation and
	study, and seriously grasping it.

	Many Communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art,
	but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist art. Isn't this a strange
	thing?

In June 1964, Comrade Mao Zedong also gave the following warning to the "All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles" and various "associations" formed after liberation:

	"These associations and the publications they control (it is said that
	there are a few good ones), for the past fifteen years, have basically
	(not all people) not implemented the party's policies, acted as officials
	and lords, did not approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did
	not reflect the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years,
	they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they are not
	seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the
	Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day."

But that small handful of officials and lords have been bewitched by the thoughts of the bourgeoisie and modern revisionism. "Those who support the bourgeoisie's academic authorities within the party and walk the capitalist road," "those who infiltrate the party to protect the bourgeoisie's academic authorities," "those who do not read books, do not read newspapers, do not contact the masses, have no knowledge, and rely on 'arbitrariness and coercion' to usurp the name of the party," and "those who have long been soaked in the bourgeois soul," do not listen to Comrade Mao Zedong's warnings at all. They still want to struggle desperately on their own bourgeois and modern revisionist tracks. After a year and a half, in February 1966, Peng Zhen actually threw out his infamous "February Outline," which is a summary of the reactionary thoughts of a small handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party.

Our great proletarian thinker—Comrade Mao Zedong—with his invincible dialectical and historical materialist scalpel, thoroughly exposed the ugly face of Peng Zhen's "February Outline" and called on the whole party to raise high the great banner of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is the "Notification" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966.

In this great historical document, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:

	"The Central Committee and the various departments of the Central
	Committee, the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, all
	have such a group of bourgeois representatives."

	The whole party must "raise high the great banner of the proletarian
	cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the bourgeois reactionary
	standpoint of those so-called 'academic authorities' who are anti-party
	and anti-socialist, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary
	thought in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing
	circles, and seize the leadership in these cultural fields. To do this,
	we must at the same time criticize and purge the bourgeois representatives
	who have infiltrated the party, the government, the army, and various
	cultural circles, and some of them must be transferred from their posts."

	"Those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, the
	government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of
	revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power
	and turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. Some of
	these people have been exposed by us, some have not been exposed, and
	some are being used by us and are being cultivated as our successors,
	such as the Khrushchev type. They are now sleeping next to us. All
	levels of the party committee must fully pay attention to this."

The struggle was provoked by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party. But the law of history does not change with their will. They lifted the stone only to drop it on their own feet.

Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rising like the sun on the Chinese mainland, shaking the earth.

A very powerful proletarian political force has brought forth a very powerful proletarian cultural revolution movement. Undoubtedly, this powerful proletarian cultural revolution will accelerate our historical process and open up a new era for the international proletarian revolutionary struggle.

The current developing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a continuation and development of the great debate on literary and artistic issues in the revolutionary base areas in the 1940s, a continuation and development of the great ideological and political debates of that time in a new historical stage, and a continuation and development of these great debates under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

Comrade Mao Zedong fully paid attention to the experience of the entire history of the Soviet Union. In his series of great works and instructions, and in his personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he correctly solved this series of problems. This is a very important sign, marking the development of Marxism to a new stage. In the early 20th century, Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism. In the present era, it has developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Marx and Engels established the theory of scientific socialism. Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, solving a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism, and solving the theoretical and practical problems of realizing proletarian dictatorship in one country. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of problems of contemporary proletarian revolution, and solving the theoretical and practical problems of carrying out revolution under proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration. These are three great milestones in the history of the development of Marxism.

We must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study and apply Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and his series of documents and instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, combine them with the practical experience of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, raise our level of struggle, concentrate our forces to criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live proletarian dictatorship!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年
    陈伯达同志们：
    现在世界正在进入一个完全崭新的历史时代。这是以工农兵为主人翁的新时代，是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    二十五年前，我们伟大导师毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》预示着工农兵为主人翁的新时代，即将在全中国到来，同样，也即将经过不同的历程，在世界各国到来。
    毛泽东同志这篇伟大的著作，是二十五年前以文艺问题为题，实质上是属于政治问题的一次大论战的总结，是围绕着关于肯定工农兵或者否定工农兵这一个当代政治根本问题的一次大论战的总结。
    这篇伟大著作，是我们党关于依照无产阶级先锋队的面貌改造党、改造世界的一篇划时代的政治宣言书，解决了一切要作无产阶级革命家的世界观问题，解决了许多共产党员在组织上入了党而思想上是否入党的问题，指出了一切共产党员、一切革命家同工农兵群众相结合的光辉道路。
    这篇伟大著作所涉及的，不限于文艺问题，但它又是用无产阶级的世界观对于文艺斗争经验的总结，是历史上第一次出现的解决文艺问题的百科全书，是马克思列宁主义在文艺方面进行的一个全面的大革命，并且成为当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的指南和纲领。
    这篇伟大著作，在实质上，还成为世界上被压迫阶级、被压迫人民同帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派进行政治大搏斗的思想武器，成为各国革命者在思想上、政治上向帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和反动派进军的号角。
    毛泽东同志关于京剧革命的一封信上说：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台”。毛泽东同志认为，这种历史的颠倒，现在要再颠倒过来。
    创造历史的劳动人民，工人、农民和由工农武装起来的士兵，要去占领政治的舞台和经济生活的舞台，还必须去占领文艺的舞台。这就是毛泽东同志的结论。
    在阶级社会里，文化思想战线的斗争，其中包括文艺战线上的斗争，都没有例外地是阶级斗争，是阶级斗争的一种形式。
    正如马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》所说的，一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。
    毛泽东同志彻头彻尾地把资产阶级那些所谓超阶级、超政治的腐朽废话，都扔到垃圾堆里面去。毛泽东同志彻底地批判了托洛茨基所谓“政治——马克思主义的；艺术——资产阶级的”二元论或多元论的反动观点。毛泽东同志认为，并没有什么超阶级的政治，也没有什么独立于阶级政治之外的文学艺术。毛泽东同志在一切问题上，同样地在文艺问题上，一贯地阐明了一元化的无产阶级宇宙观。他完全正确地说，“一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”
    毛泽东同志发展了列宁关于党的文学的论点。他指出一切革命文学家，如果要真正地为工农兵服务，为革命的人民服务，就必须执行我们党的正确的无产阶级政治路线，就必须站在无产阶级立场上。
    很清楚，一切革命文学家，如果不执行党的正确的无产阶级政治路线，不努力站在无产阶级世界观的立场上，就不会去接近工农兵群众，不会去参加工农兵的实际革命斗争。结果，就不可能正确地表现工农兵，也不可能反转过来正确教育工农兵群众，而且会和工农兵群众的事业背道而驰。
    毛泽东同志告诉我们：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分”。“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治”。这种无产阶级政治对于文艺的作用和无产阶级文艺对于无产阶级政治的反作用，必然要经历很长的时期，经历长时期的无产阶级斗争到革命的胜利，经历长时期的无产阶级专政。
    无产阶级文化大革命，在我国的出现，不是偶然的。无产阶级革命胜利了，无产阶级专政实现了，我们还完全不能低估地主资产阶级的影响。正如毛泽东同志反复指示，在社会主义社会，还存在着阶级、阶级斗争，还存在着资产阶级和无产阶级两个阶级的斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。
    保卫无产阶级革命的果实、反对资本主义复辟的这个斗争，是很严重的。地主资产阶级失掉了政权，失掉了封建主义、资本主义所有制。但是，他们在文化、思想、文艺阵地上还是有力量的，他们那些历史久远的、强烈地表现自己剥削阶级的文艺，在群众中还是有市场的。劳动群众在无产阶级领导下，打倒了地主资产阶级和国际资本势力的统治以后，不可能一下摆脱他们长期形成的那些文化影响，思想影响，文艺影响。同国际资本势力密切联系在一起的地主资产阶级，他们千方百计地想保持这些阵地，巩固这些阵地，争夺这些阵地，来腐蚀我们的群众，腐蚀我们的革命干部。他们要用和平演变的手段，让那些奴役我们人民的国际帝国主义势力卷土重来，把我们的无产阶级剥夺剥夺者的政权，再变成他们地主资产阶级剥夺者的政权，把我们的社会主义的国家财产，社会主义的集体财产，再变成他们的吸血的财产，重新压迫人民，重新剥削人民，重新把人民置于水深火热之中。
    在地主资产阶级和国际资本势力还在天天梦想恢复他们天堂的这样时期内，小资产阶级还会不断生长出新资产阶级。小资产阶级的摇摆性是很严重的。地主资产阶级总是想通过小资产阶级的摇摆性，同样地，总是想通过资产阶级知识分子，通过不少文化工作者、思想工作者、文艺工作者的摇摆性，来篡夺我们的文化、思想、文艺的阵地，而为他们实行反革命复辟的活动，制造便利。的确，在思想、文艺的阵地上，有的原封未动，有的是被篡夺了。
    江青同志一贯坚持和保卫毛主席的文艺革命路线。她是打头阵的。这几年来，她用最大的努力，在戏剧、音乐、舞蹈各个方面，做了一系列革命的样板，把牛鬼蛇神赶下文艺的舞台，树立了工农兵群众的英雄形象。许多文艺工作者，在毛泽东思想的指引下，同江青同志一起，成为文艺革命披荆斩棘的人。还有，许多革命的文化工作者，思想工作者，他们在这些阵地上反对资本主义复辟的努力，具有很重要的意义，这也都是很清楚的。
    在无产阶级还没有取得政权的时候，革命的文化工作者，思想工作者，文艺工作者，他们为工农兵服务，在出生入死的斗争中，就是为的要经过不同革命阶段（由民主革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段），去争得无产阶级胜利，争得无产阶级政权。在无产阶级取得政权之后，在无产阶级专政下，革命的文艺工作者，文化工作者，思想工作者，他们为工农兵服务，就是为的要在革命的继续前进中，争得无产阶级专政的巩固，争得社会主义的跃进。
    无产阶级取得政权以后，能够不能够保持这一个政权，巩固这一个政权，强化这一个政权，这是摆在我们面前的一个非常实际的根本问题。
    在一九四九年，全国解放的前夜，毛泽东同志就在我们全党提出，必须预防敌人用糖衣炮弹的攻击。
    毛泽东同志的预见，是真正科学的，是很英明的。
    敌人的糖衣炮弹有多种多样。他们很懂得利用象“文艺”之类的糖衣炮弹。资产阶级就是要利用剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，以便“征服人心”，从而削弱无产阶级专政，从而为反革命复辟扫清道路。
    毛泽东同志在一九六二年党的八届十中全会上，针对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派大闹单干风的实际情况，特别地、强调地提出关于社会主义社会里面还存在阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的理论问题，同时指出：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    可以说，革命或反革命的阶级总是把造成舆论作为夺取政权的准备，这是毛泽东同志阐明的一条重要历史定律。古今中外，一切阶级斗争的历史，都没有例外是这样的。
    这种“舆论准备”，其中包括文艺。
    全国解放以后，毛泽东同志一直关注着无产阶级的文化革命的问题。毛泽东同志一直把无产阶级在政治战线上、经济战线上、文化思想战线上这些方面的斗争联结在一起。十七年来，所有文化思想战线上的重大问题，从批判卖国主义《清宫秘史》、奴隶主义《武训传》、唯心论《红楼梦研究》开始，都是毛泽东同志提出来的。现在我们重新学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛泽东同志的关于思想、文艺问题的一系列战斗性文件，非常必要。毛泽东同志在全国解放后的这一系列文件，是要大家注意清除资产阶级及其他剥削阶级的习惯势力和影响，而归根到底，就是在于防备资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政。
    一切真诚的共产党员，对于思想、文艺问题，如果掉以轻心，如果稍为忽视毛泽东同志在这些问题上的教导，就会在政治上犯大错误，就可能在政治上滑到资产阶级的泥坑，就可能在政治上潜移默化，演变为象苏联赫鲁晓夫集团那样的反革命修正主义者，就可能和那些混进党内的资产阶级代表人物同流合污，用各种各样的阴谋诡计，去搞反革命的资本主义复辟。
    是不是所有事实，都无情地揭露这一点，证明这一点呢？是的，完全是这样的。
    毛泽东同志不断地敲出警钟。
    一九六三年十二月间，毛泽东同志曾经严厉地批判我们国家艺术工作方面的弱点，指出党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术”这样的“咄咄怪事”。他说：
        各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、
    诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部
    门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。不
    能低估电影、新诗、民歌、美术、小说的成绩，但其中的问题
    也不少。至于戏剧等部门，问题就更大了。社会经济基础已经
    改变了，为这个基础服务的上层建筑之一的艺术部门，至今还
    是大问题。这需要从调查研究着手，认真地抓起来。
        许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不
    热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。
    一九六四年六月间，毛泽东同志对于解放以后组成的“全国文联”和各“协会”，还提出过以下的警告：
        “这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个
    好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做
    官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。
    最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在
    将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。”
    但是，那一小撮做官当老爷的，已经被资产阶级、现代修正主义的思想迷了心窍。“那些支持资产阶级学阀的党内走资本主义道路的当权派”，“那些钻进党内保护资产阶级学阀的资产阶级代表人物”，那些“不读书、不看报、不接触群众、什么学问也没有、专靠‘武断和以势压人’、窃取党的名义的大党阀”，还有，那些老早浸透了资产阶级灵魂的某些所谓“文化人”，对于毛泽东同志的警告，根本听不进去。他们还是要按照自己的资产阶级、现代修正主义的轨道，拚命挣扎。经过一年半之后，到了一九六六年二月，彭真居然抛出他那个修正主义的、臭名昭著的所谓《二月提纲》。这是集中地表达了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动思想的一个“提纲”。
    我们的无产阶级天才思想家——毛泽东同志，用他的所向无敌的唯物辩证法解剖刀，把彭真《二月提纲》的丑恶面貌，尽情尽致地揭露出来，并号召全党高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗。这就是中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日发出的《通知》。
    毛泽东同志在这个伟大的历史文件中指出：
          “中央和中央各机关，各省、市、自治区，都有这样一批
    资产阶级代表人物。”
        全党必须“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反
    党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批
    判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思
    想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。而要做到这一点，必须同
    时批判混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶
    级代表人物，清洗这些人，有些则要调动他们的职务。”
        “混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表
    人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会
    要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有
    些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信
    用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现
    正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    斗争是由党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑动起来的。但是，历史的规律，并不以他们的意志为转移。他们搬起石头打了自己的脚。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，一个史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正象旭日那样，兴起在中国大陆上，震动了大地。
    非常强大的无产阶级政治力量，推出一个非常强大的无产阶级文化革命运动。而毫无疑问，这个强大的无产阶级文化革命，将加速我们的历史进程，并将为国际的无产阶级革命斗争开辟一个新纪元。
    当前发展的无产阶级文化大革命，是四十年代在革命根据地中，关于文艺问题大论战的继续和发展，是当时思想大论战、政治大论战在新的历史阶段上的继续和发展，是这些大论战在无产阶级专政条件下的继续和发展。
    毛泽东同志充分注意了整个苏联历史的经验，在他的一系列伟大著作和指示中，在他亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中，正确地解决了这一系列问题。这是一个最重要的标志，标志着马克思主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。在二十世纪初叶，马克思主义发展到了列宁主义的阶段。现时代，又发展到了毛泽东思想的阶段。
    马克思和恩格斯创立了科学社会主义的理论，列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，解决了帝国主义时代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题，毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑。
    我们要在无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列文件和指示，结合一年来无产阶级文化大革命的实践经验，提高我们的斗争水平，集中力量批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席的革命文艺路线万岁！
    在毛泽东思想旗帜下的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
