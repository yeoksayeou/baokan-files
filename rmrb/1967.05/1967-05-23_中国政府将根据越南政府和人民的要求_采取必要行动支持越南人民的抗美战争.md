	Foreign Minister Chen Yi stated at a meeting with the Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires Lyh Chung-chih that the Chinese government will take necessary actions to support the Vietnamese people's anti-American war as requested by the Vietnamese government and people.

	The U.S. imperialists' dispatch of troops into the demilitarized zone is a desperate struggle in the face of their defeat in Vietnam.

	New China News Agency, May 22 -- Foreign Minister Chen Yi met with the Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires Lyh Chung-chih this afternoon. Lyh Chung-chih presented to Chen Yi a statement issued by the Vietnamese government on May 21 regarding the large-scale dispatch of U.S. and puppet troops into the demilitarized zone. Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government, told the Vietnamese Charge d'Affaires:

	The Chinese government and people firmly support the just position taken by the Vietnamese government in its May 21 statement. While the U.S. imperialists are conducting continuous and frenzied bombings of the Vietnamese capital Hanoi, they have brazenly dispatched ground troops into the demilitarized zone. This is a serious escalation of the war and a reckless attempt to expand it, and it is the desperate struggle of U.S. imperialism in the face of its defeat in the Vietnam War. The Chinese government and the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will closely monitor the developments in Vietnam and be ready, at any time, to take necessary actions and provide full support to the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and for national salvation, as requested by the Vietnamese government and people. As the Vietnamese government's statement points out, the Johnson administration must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences arising from its reckless actions.

    陈毅外长接见越南驻华临时代办黎终始时表示
    中国政府将根据越南政府和人民的要求  采取必要行动支持越南人民的抗美战争
    美帝派遣军队侵入非军事区是它侵越惨败后的垂死挣扎
    新华社二十二日讯　陈毅外交部长今天下午接见了越南民主共和国驻我国大使馆临时代办黎终始。黎终始临时代办向陈毅外长面交了越南民主共和国政府五月二十一日就美国大规模向非军事区派遣美军和伪军一事发表的声明。陈毅外长代表我国政府向越南代办表示：
    中国政府和中国人民，坚决支持越南民主共和国政府五月二十一日声明的严正立场。美帝国主义在对越南民主共和国首都河内进行连续疯狂轰炸的同时，又悍然派遣地面部队侵入非军事区，这是一个严重的战争“升级”和扩大战争的冒险行动，是美帝国主义在侵越战争中遭到惨败后的垂死挣扎。中国政府和用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，将密切注视越南局势的发展，随时准备根据越南政府和人民的要求，采取必要的行动，全力支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。正如越南民主共和国政府声明指出的，约翰逊政府必须对它所采取的冒险行动而引起的一切严重后果，承担全部责任。
