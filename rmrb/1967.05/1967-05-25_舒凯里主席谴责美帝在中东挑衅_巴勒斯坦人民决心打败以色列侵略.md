    Shukairy, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, condemned U.S. imperialism for instigating and supporting Israel's new provocations against Arab countries at a press conference held in Cairo on the 21st. He declared: The Palestinian people and their army are determined to defeat any new Israeli aggression and liberate the occupied territories.

    He said: The United States created Israel and is still providing it with weapons and dollars. The United States is now playing a dangerous role, attempting to turn the Middle East into another Vietnam. If they dare to launch a military invasion, the Palestinian people will, together with the Arab people, defeat them and settle accounts with them.

    Shukairy said that the Palestine Liberation Army has already moved into the front lines of the Gaza Strip, ready to take the lead in the battle to liberate occupied Palestine.

    Shukairy said that the Palestine Liberation Organization has decided to establish several battalions of people's resistance forces and national guard units in the Gaza Strip. He expressed support for the activities of Palestinian commando units within Israeli territory. He said: "Our goal is liberation, and our method is armed struggle."

    Shukairy also expressed gratitude at the press conference for China's firm support for the liberation cause of the Palestinian people.

    新华社开罗二十一日电　巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里二十一日在这里举行的记者招待会上，谴责美帝国主义唆使和支持以色列对阿拉伯国家进行新的挑衅。他宣布：巴勒斯坦人民和军队决心打败以色列的任何新侵略，解放被占领的国土。
    他说：美国制造了以色列，而且还在向它提供武器和美元。美国现在正在扮演危险的角色，企图把中东地区变成另一个越南。如果它们胆敢进行军事侵略，巴勒斯坦人民将同阿拉伯人民一道打败它们，跟它们算账。
    舒凯里说，巴勒斯坦解放军已经进入加沙地带的前沿阵地，准备在解放被占领的巴勒斯坦的战斗中担当先锋队。
    舒凯里说，巴勒斯坦解放组织决定在加沙地带建立几个营的人民抗战部队和国民警卫队。他表示支持巴勒斯坦突击队在以色列境内的活动。他说：“我们的目的是解放，我们的办法是武装斗争。”
