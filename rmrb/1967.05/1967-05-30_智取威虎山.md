**Scene 1: Advancing in Victory**

[Winter of 1946. Near Mudanjiang in Northeast China.]

[Forest and snow-covered plains.]

[The People's Liberation Army's pursuit team is fully armed, with a red flag leading the way, rushing forward. Luan Chaojia: Report to 203, we have arrived at the fork in the road! Shao Jianbo: Halt! Luan Chaojia: Line up!]

[Everyone lines up.]

[Gao Bo hands over a map. Shao Jianbo: (Looking at the map, surveying the terrain) Luan Chaojia. Luan Chaojia: Here. Shao Jianbo: Rest here. Luan Chaojia: Yes. Li Hongyi, on guard.]

[Li Hongyi stands guard and exits. Luan Chaojia: (Turning to the direction of the incoming sound, gesturing) Quartermaster! Rest here!]

[Sounds of horses and footsteps. Everyone stomps their feet to warm up, shaking off the accumulated snow. Shao Jianbo: Everyone, are you tired? Soldiers: Not tired! Shao Jianbo: Good! Comrades! Yang Zhirong and Sun Dade went to the front station for reconnaissance. This is the meeting point. The bandit Zuo Maotou has fled into the deep mountains and forests. We have been marching in the wind and snow for several days and still haven't found them! We must be prepared for continuous battle. Soldiers: Yes. Shao Jianbo: Comrades, this time the regiment party committee selected us thirty-six people to form a pursuit team, deep into the forest and snow-covered plains, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "Establish a Solid Northeast Base," mobilize the masses in the Mudanjiang area, eliminate bandits, secure the rear, support the field army, and shatter the American-Chiang Kai-shek attack. This is a task of great strategic significance. We must, as Chairman Mao teaches, "Make up our minds, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory!" Soldiers: Resolutely complete the mission! Li Hongyi: (Entering) Report to 203, Yang Platoon Leader and the others have returned from reconnaissance!]

[Yang Zhirong and Sun Dade enter, saluting. Yang Zhirong: Report! Shao Jianbo: Comrade Zhirong, you've worked hard! Yang Zhirong: We were ordered to disguise ourselves and scout. Along the way, it was difficult to find locals, but in a secluded valley, we saved a mute child. His father pointed us to the strategic location of the small forest railway at Heilonggou, where we gathered some information and tracked down Zuo Maotou's whereabouts. Shao Jianbo: Good. Yang Zhirong: (Singing "Xipi Shake Plate")]

In this area, bandits frequently come and go,
Their unit is the "Fifth Security Brigade, First Battalion."
Along the railway, large and small stations have all been raided,
Last night, Heilonggou was ravaged again.
The entire village is silent, a charred wasteland,
Zuo Maotou is ruthless and evil, his crimes are endless.
After committing atrocities, they fled to Jiaopigou,
Judging by the situation, this habitual bandit has returned to Weigongshan.
Shao Jianbo: Comrades! We have tracked down Zuo Maotou's location. Tonight, we will camp at Heilonggou. Comrade Zhirong! Yang Zhirong: Here. Shao Jianbo: We need to further grasp the enemy situation. You take Sun Dade, Dong Zhongsong, and Li Hongyi (the three step forward) to continue scouting ahead. Do not miss any clues related to the bandits! Yang Zhirong: Yes. Depart!]

[Yang Zhirong, Sun Dade, Dong Zhongsong, and Li Hongyi turn and rush off. Shao Jianbo: Comrades! (Singing "Xipi Scattered Plate")]

The pursuit team carries the heavy burden for the people,
Supporting the frontline, securing the rear with an iron will.
Crossing steep mountains, climbing sheer cliffs, breaking through difficulties,
We must let the sun shine on the deep valleys and mountains!
[Everyone "poses."]

[Lights dim, curtain falls rapidly.]

**Scene 2: Jiaopigou Raided**

[Dusk. At the entrance of Jiaopigou Village.]

[The fake "Fifth Security Brigade" bandit chief Zuo Maotou, Da Maizi, and Taobizi lead the bandits, peering into the village from a distance. Da Maizi: Third Uncle, this time returning to the mountain, we've looted a lot of things along the way; Jiaopigou is right at our doorstep, let's not touch it this time. Zuo Maotou: Don't worry about that! Chief of Staff, capture more poor people to bring back and build fortifications! Men and women, all are needed! Da Maizi: (Understanding) Got it.]

[Da Maizi leads the bandits into the village. Taobizi is about to enter the village but is stopped by Zuo Maotou. Zuo Maotou: Deputy Chief of Staff, has it been ten days since One Tuft went to find Luan Ping? Taobizi: Exactly ten days, and I'm also worried about this matter. Zuo Maotou: Tsk! I heard that Chiang Kai-shek has arrived in Shenyang, personally supervising the battle, and will soon launch a major offensive against North Manchuria! Taobizi: Can we still hope for that day? Zuo Maotou: Don't you remember? Last time at the Mudanjiang meeting, Commissioner Hou didn't say that the Americans are publicly mediating peace talks between the Nationalists and Communists, but secretly helping Chiang Kai-shek mobilize troops, aiming to eliminate the Communist forces inside and outside the Great Wall within three months! I think the time has come! Taobizi: Good! This time we can finally vent our pent-up anger! Zuo Maotou: Hmm! When we return to Weigongshan, the first thing is to quickly expand our strength. Taobizi: Yes. As long as One Tuft can find Luan Ping and get the liaison map, the Mudanjiang area will all be ours. Zuo Maotou: Exactly. Hey, I heard Commissioner Hou is also looking for this map, so we must not let him get it! Taobizi: Third Uncle, don't worry, One Tuft and Luan Ping are sworn brothers, the map won't fly away. Once the Nationalist Army arrives, the commander of North Manchuria will be you! Zuo Maotou: Hahaha! (Singing "Xipi Scattered Plate")]

For generations, Weigongshan has been under our control,
The fame of a "three-generation elder" has spread.
Taobizi: Indeed! Zhang Dashan, Manchukuo, and Chiang Kai-shek, all need you, Third Uncle.
Zuo Maotou: Hmph! (Continuing to sing)
The Americans and Chiang Kai-shek are fighting a civil war,
I want to seize the three provinces and half the sky!
[Zuo Maotou, in his arrogance, rushes into the village with Taobizi.]

[Fires break out in the village, screams echo. Li Yongqi, carrying a rifle and game, enters. Li Yongqi: (Singing "Xipi Scattered Plate")]

Fires light up the sky, people are in chaos,
Mothers call for their children, children call for their mothers.
The bandits have come to burn and kill,
Risking my life to fight them!
[The bandits forcibly drag away young men and women from the village, binding them with ropes. Li Yongqi struggles with the bandits, the crowd is pulled and beaten by the bandits, and they exit. Li Yongqi's wife is dragged up, and Li's mother, holding a baby, rushes up. The bandit company commander snatches the baby and throws it off the cliff. Li Yongqi, enraged, fights with the bandits, his left arm is injured. Zuo Maotou enters, shoots at Li Yongqi; Li's wife shields him and is hit, dying. Zuo Maotou and the others exit. Li Yongqi: (Looking at his wife in grief) Mother! Mother! Mother! Li's Mother: (Rushing over, screaming) Mother! Li Yongqi: (Singing "Xipi Fast Plate")]

A thunderclap of disaster strikes,
Fierce anger burns in my chest.
Seeing my wife lying in a pool of blood,
Seeing my child fall off the cliff!
Deep hatred, I must avenge—
Zuo Maotou! (Continuing to sing)
Catch you, chop you with an axe, repay the blood debt!
[Li Yongqi tries to rush forward; the bandits charge up and bind Li Yongqi. Li's Mother: Yongqi!]

[Li Yongqi struggles fiercely.]

[Curtain falls.]

**Scene 3: Deep Mountain Grievances**

[Afternoon. In a secluded valley. In the distance, mountains overlap, a few rays of sunlight filter through the forest. Nearby is a small wooden house, with dishes scattered on the table.]

[Chang Bao is cleaning the table inside the house, Chang Hunter looks out the window, then rushes back inside. Chang Bao: Father, the man and woman who just came are unreasonable, they ate all the deer meat we just got. Chang Hunter: Chang Bao, we can't stay here! We must leave quickly! Chang Bao: Leave? Chang Hunter: Do you know who that man and woman are? Chang Bao: Didn't he say he is a soldier of the liberation army? Chang Hunter: Hmph! Eight years ago, I was taken to Weigongshan, and on the mountain, I saw him. He is called One Tuft, a bandit. Chang Bao: Ah! Chang Hunter: He didn't recognize me, but I recognized him. Quick, take the few furs you hid, go to your uncle Dashan in Jiaopigou. Chang Bao: Yes. (Packing) Chang Hunter: (To himself) A few days ago, those two fur traders said that the Communist Party has come to our hometown, helping the poor to revolt, I wonder if it's true or not! Chang Bao: Father, those two fur traders are good people, they won't lie. If they hadn't saved me in the snow, I would have frozen to death! Chang Hunter: Right! Let's go find out.]

[Chang Bao takes out the furs and rifle, Chang Hunter packs the luggage, exits, and hears footsteps. Chang Bao: Father, someone is coming!]

[Chang Hunter quickly covers Chang Bao's mouth. Chang Hunter: Don't speak!]

[They retreat into the house, listening intently.]

[Yang Zhirong, Sun Dade, Dong Zhongsong, and Li Hongyi, wearing cloaks and hoods covering the red stars on their caps, walk through the snow. They cautiously scout the surroundings. Yang Zhirong: (Singing "Xipi Scattered Plate")]

On the way, relying on the locals' enthusiasm, we follow the suspicious man and woman.
In the deep mountains, there are no paths, no traces,
[Looking at the terrain]
Old Sun, isn't this the hunter Chang's house? Sun Dade: Yes, I've been here with you before. Yang Zhirong: Right. (Continuing to sing)
Visit the hunter's house to solve the mystery.
Sun Dade, Li Hongyi, continue to search ahead, and meet here if you find anything. Sun Dade, Li Hongyi: Yes. (Exit) Yang Zhirong: Little Dong, on guard! Dong Zhongsong: Yes. (Exits) Yang Zhirong: (Approaching the house) Fellow villager, fellow villager!]

[Chang Hunter comes out of the house, tense. Chang Hunter: Who are you looking for? Yang Zhirong: Even relatives don't recognize me? I am the fur trader who came a few days ago. Chang Hunter: You are a fur trader?]

[Chang Bao comes out of the house, Chang Hunter quickly stops her, but it's too late. Yang Zhirong: (To Chang Bao) Little brother, your father doesn't recognize me, didn't I send you home that day? Chang Bao: (Wants to speak but stops, nods) ... Yang Zhirong: (Noticing something but remaining calm) What a clever child. Chang Hunter: (Interrupting) He is mute. Yang Zhirong: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Chang Hunter: (Looking at Yang Zhirong closely, recognizing him) Oh, you are Manager Yang. Yang Zhirong: Yes. Chang Hunter: Come in, come in, come in.]

[They enter the house and sit down. Yang Zhirong: (To Chang Hunter) Is she better now? Chang Hunter: (Quickly responding) She is better now. Right, we have recognized relatives. To be honest, you do business and also serve in the army, what exactly do you do? Yang Zhirong: I am not a businessman. (Pulling down the hood, revealing the red star) I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. Chang Hunter: (Half-believing) You are also a soldier of the liberation army? Yang Zhirong: Yes. Have you seen soldiers of the liberation army? Chang Hunter: (Covering up) No, no... no! Yang Zhirong: Last time I came, I didn't have much to say. I came from Shandong. Old Chang, our hometown is not as hard as when you came to the Northeast! Chang Hunter: That's good. But from so far away, why did you come here? Yang Zhirong: To fight bandits! Chang Hunter: Fight bandits? Can you do it? Yang Zhirong: Our main forces are all behind us! Let me tell you, our liberation army has won several major victories in the Northeast, the Mudanjiang area is all liberated. The large bandit groups have been crushed, only the stubborn bandits like Zuo Maotou have fled into the deep mountains and forests, we must quickly eliminate them! Chang Hunter: That would be great! Yang Zhirong: Old Chang, this area has been ravaged by Zuo Maotou! You and your son are hiding in the deep mountains and forests, you must have deep hatred! Chang Hunter: (Grievously) Zuo Maotou...! Yang Zhirong: Old Chang, speak! Chang Hunter: (Reluctant to touch the painful topic) Eight years have passed, don't mention it! Chang Bao: (Unable to hold back) Father—! Chang Hunter: (Startled, painfully) Chang Bao, you... Yang Zhirong: (With deep emotion) Child! The Communist Party and Chairman Mao will stand up for you! Speak! Chang Bao: Uncle! I'll speak, I'll speak! (Singing "Reverse Plate")]

Eight years ago, disaster struck on a snowy night!
(Original Plate - Child's Tune)
Zuo Maotou killed my grandmother and took my parents.
Uncle Dashan in Jiaopigou took me in,
Father escaped, but Mother jumped off the cliff and died.
Avoiding the deep mountains, Father feared I would fall into the devil's hands,
Since then, I have pretended to be mute, dressing as a boy.
(Changing to "Fast Two-Six")
During the day, father and daughter hunt in the mountains,
At night, Father thinks of Grandmother, I think of Mother.
Waiting for the stars and the moon,
I only hope that the deep mountains will see the sun,
I only hope to speak in front of people,
I only hope to return to my girl's clothes soon,
I only hope—to settle the eight-year blood debt,
I hate that I can't fly with wings, hold a rifle, and fly to the hilltop, kill all the wolves!
[While Chang Bao is telling her story, Chang Hunter listens sadly. Yang Zhirong: (Indignantly, singing "Xipi Original Plate")]

Little Chang Bao accuses the bandits' crimes,
Every word is blood, every tear, stirring my hatred.
All the oppressed people in the world have a blood debt,
To avenge, to seek justice, blood debts must be repaid with blood.
(Changing to "Xipi Flowing Water")
Eliminate Zuo Maotou, the people will be liberated,
Turn over and become masters, the deep mountains will see the sun.
From now on, follow the savior Communist Party,
Make the mountains and rivers change their appearance.
This place will be like our hometown,
Beautiful days will last forever! Chang Hunter: (Excitedly) Old Yang!]

[They sit together. Chang Hunter: Old Yang, you've touched my heart. Sigh, fighting Zuo Maotou is not easy, for decades, several dynasties have changed, whenever there is a disturbance, he runs to Weigongshan, relying on the nine groups and twenty-seven fortresses, he can attack, defend, and escape, no one can catch him. Yang Zhirong: Yes, it is difficult. I heard that the path up the mountain is very hard to take! Chang Hunter: Indeed, the front mountain has only one clear path, it is high and steep, truly "one person guards, ten thousand cannot pass"! Plus, the defenses are strict, layer upon layer of sentries, who can get up there! Yang Zhirong: How did you come down from the mountain back then? Chang Hunter: There is a dangerous path on the back mountain. That place is a steep cliff, with deep grass and dense forest, no one dares to walk, the bandits have not set up defenses. Eight years ago, I came down from there, if I hadn't fallen on a tree branch, I would have been smashed to pieces! Yang Zhirong: Old Chang, the information you provided is very useful. As long as we all work together, there is no mountain we cannot conquer. Chang Hunter: Right! I just hope for that day! Old Yang, I'm not treating you as an outsider, just now, a man and a woman came here, that man is clearly a bandit, but he also said he is a soldier of the liberation army. Chang Bao: Eight years ago, my father saw him on Weigongshan, he is called One Tuft. Yang Zhirong: One Tuft! What else did he say? Chang Hunter: He called that woman sister-in-law, and said something about Luan Ping's sworn brother. Yang Zhirong: (Hearing this, blurts out) Luan Ping? Chang Hunter: It seems that the woman is Luan Ping's wife. One Tuft and her had a big argument, fighting over some map? Chang Bao: Liaison map. Chang Hunter: Right. Yang Zhirong: Liaison map?]

[Dong Zhongsong enters quietly, patrols outside the house. Dong Zhongsong: (Knocks on the door) Platoon Leader!]

[Yang Zhirong opens the door. Dong Zhongsong: Old Sun and the others have returned.]

[Sun Dade and Li Hongyi enter, come into the house. Sun Dade: (Greeting Chang Hunter) Fellow villager. Li Hongyi: Old Yang, we found a bloody glove in the dense forest to the northeast, near it was a woman's corpse. (Hands the glove to Yang Zhirong) Sun Dade: We searched the surroundings, but the footprints were covered by the heavy snow, we don't know where the killer fled. Yang Zhirong: Old Chang, have you seen this glove before? Chang Hunter: (Looking at the glove) Hmm, this glove belongs to One Tuft. Yang Zhirong: He must have killed someone and stolen the "liaison map." What does this have to do with Luan Ping? Dong Zhongsong: (Pulling Yang Zhirong aside) Platoon Leader, wasn't the bandit you caught at Jiu Long Hui named Luan Ping? Yang Zhirong: Yes, it is him! Comrades, this murder case is complicated, involving the detained Luan Ping. Dong Zhongsong, I will go with Old Sun and Little Li to catch the killer. You report the situation to 203. I suggest interrogating Luan Ping and investigating the liaison map! Dong Zhongsong: Yes. (Runs off) Yang Zhirong: Old Chang, the situation is urgent, I can't talk to you more. This bit of dry food, I leave it for you.]

[Yang Zhirong takes off his dry food bag and hands it to Chang Hunter; Sun Dade and the others also take off their food bags and hand them to Chang Bao. Chang Bao: (Moved) Uncle... Yang Zhirong: It seems you can't stay here either, avoid for a while. Our troops will come soon and it will be easier. Old Chang, see you later. Chang Hunter: Old Yang, where are you going? Yang Zhirong: To capture One Tuft. Chang Hunter: No! One Tuft is definitely heading to Weigongshan. The path here is already difficult to walk, and now with the heavy snow, strangers will definitely get lost. Come, we father and son will guide you! Yang Zhirong: Old Chang, thank you!]

[Curtain falls.]

**Scene 4: Planning**

[Morning. The pursuit team's camp at Heilonggou.]

[Outside the door, the wind howls, snowflakes fly. Shao Jianbo faces the map, deep in thought, gazing out the window. Shao Jianbo: (Singing "Erhuang Reverse Plate")]

The north wind blows through the forest, the valley echoes,
(Back Dragon)
Looking at the flying snow dancing in the sky, the towering mountains are covered in silver.
What a beautiful northern landscape.
(Erhuang Slow Plate)
The mountains and rivers are magnificent, with countless scenes,
How can we bear to let the tiger come and the wolf go, causing more harm!
(Changing to "Erhuang Original Plate")
The Party Central Committee guides the direction of advance,
The revolutionary flame is unstoppable.
The People's Liberation Army fights thousands of miles, carrying the people's hopes,
We will plant the red flag all over the country.
No matter how the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek conspire, fake talks, real fights, open or secret arrows, a hundred tricks, how can they stop
Our righteousness in hand, hatred in heart, one against
Ten, swearing to sweep away the reactionaries.
(Changing to "Erhuang Fast Three Eyes")
Comrades grow under the banner of Mao Zedong,
Thirty-six red hearts facing the sun.
Breaking through the snow like lightning, rushing over the hills,
Clearing the way, stronger with each battle.
Withstanding the wind, enduring the waves,
In the revolutionary furnace, tempered into steel.
Zuo Maotou is just a sacrifice for the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek,
Struggling to death in the deep mountains, it is difficult to escape destruction.
[Yang Zhirong enters. Yang Zhirong: Report! Shao Jianbo: Come in.]

[Yang Zhirong enters the house. Shao Jianbo: Comrade Zhirong, you've worked hard! Did you catch the killer? Yang Zhirong: I caught him! This is a letter and a liaison map found on him. (Hands over the map and letter) This area is hard to find, fortunately, the hunter Old Chang guided us. The killer first pretended to be our military area scout, after Old Chang exposed him and we questioned him severely, he admitted to being from Weigongshan, named One Tuft. Shao Jianbo: Good! The hunter's help is great. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war." Without the masses, we would be at a loss! Yang Zhirong: Yes. Old Chang also provided two paths up the mountain. Based on the direction he indicated, I drew a rough map. (Hands over the rough map) One Tuft admitted to the front path, saying there are no fortifications, it is very easy to go up, obviously a lie. The back dangerous path, he didn't mention. Shao Jianbo: Hmm. Did you settle the hunter's father and daughter? Yang Zhirong: We left all our dry food with the hunter's father and daughter, they plan to move to Jiaopigou after we advance. Shao Jianbo: Good. (Looking at the map and letter) Hey, Old Yang, Luan Ping didn't mention this map before. Yang Zhirong: Yes. One Tuft said that the liaison map marks three hundred secret liaison points of Luan Ping in Northeast China, this is an important issue! Shao Jianbo: Now Gao Bo has brought Luan Ping, we will interrogate Luan Ping and clarify the liaison map. Yang Zhirong: Good, I'll go bring Luan Ping. Shao Jianbo: Old Yang, Luan Ping is your old opponent, let you interrogate him. Yang Zhirong: Yes.]

[Shao Jianbo enters the inner room. Yang Zhirong: (To the guard) Little Zhang, tell Gao Bo to bring Luan Ping.]

[Gao Bo escorts Luan Ping in, enters the house. Luan Ping sees Yang Zhirong, hesitates, then greets him. Yang Zhirong points to the chair, Luan Ping sits down. Yang Zhirong: Luan Ping, how have you been confessing? Luan Ping: I am willing to confess, whatever I know, I will confess. Yang Zhirong: You still have one thing you haven't confessed. Luan Ping: One thing? Yang Zhirong: An important thing! Luan Ping: Commander, except for what I'm wearing, I have nothing! Yang Zhirong: A map! Luan Ping: A map! Yang Zhirong: A liaison map! Luan Ping: (Startled) Ah! Yang Zhirong: Are you seeking to redeem your crimes by confessing, or are you determined to be an enemy of the people? Luan Ping: (Feigning calm) Don't be hasty, let me think. (Pretending) Oh, right, right, I remember, I heard that Xu Damabang has a secret liaison map. Yang Zhirong: You haven't confessed thoroughly! Luan Ping: Commander, don't misunderstand. This map is Xu Damabang's treasure, I haven't even seen it. Yang Zhirong: Luan Ping, you should understand our policy. Luan Ping: I understand, I understand! Confess and be lenient, resist and be strict. Yang Zhirong: I ask you, what were you doing at Nairen Mountain? Luan Ping: You know, I was the liaison officer! Yang Zhirong: Hmph! The liaison officer doesn't confess the liaison points, hasn't even seen the liaison map, acting quite well! It seems you don't want to tell the truth. —Gao Bo, take him away! Gao Bo: Come! Luan Ping: (Panicked) The Luan family is doomed, doomed! I have wronged the commander! Now I will tell the truth. There is a map, called the secret liaison map. It marks Xu Damabang's three hundred secret liaison points in Northeast China. Now it is with my wife. So, you release me, find my wife, get this map, present it to the commander, redeem my crimes, and seek lenient treatment. Yang Zhirong: Besides these three hundred liaison points, you don't care about the others? Luan Ping: The others are all Zuo Maotou. But, Zuo Maotou always wants to control North Manchuria, he is not on good terms with Xu Damabang, I rarely liaise with him. Last year on Zuo Maotou's birthday, he invited me to a banquet of one hundred chickens, I didn't even go. Yang Zhirong: (Noticing his statement, decides not to ask further) You should think carefully and write down the detailed situation of those liaison points for me. —Take him away! Gao Bo: Come! (Escorts Luan Ping away)]

[Shao Jianbo exits the inner room. Yang Zhirong: This guy is really cunning. Shao Jianbo: (Humorously) Even a fox can't outsmart a good hunter! The statements about the liaison map today are consistent with One Tuft's. Yang Zhirong: But he unintentionally mentioned the banquet of one hundred chickens, and this letter also invites him to the banquet, I think there is still a problem. Shao Jianbo: Yes. Sun Dade: (Entering) Report! Shao Jianbo: Come in.]

[Sun Dade enters the house. Shao Jianbo: Comrade Dade, what is it? Sun Dade: 203, we have been here for several days, everyone is writing letters of battle. Shao Jianbo: Was it you who led the way? Sun Dade: I... Shao Jianbo: Hahahaha! Comrades' feelings are understandable. The current situation is: brother units have already blocked the key passages in the Mudanjiang area, Zuo Maotou can't escape! To support our main force's advance south, to eliminate the concern of the rear, we must quickly eliminate this stubborn bandit group. Sun Dade: That's why everyone is anxious! Shao Jianbo: Comrade, Zuo Maotou is not easy to deal with. We have discussed this several times, right? Using a large force to suppress, it is like hitting a flea with a fist, it won't work; Weigongshan's fortifications are complex, using the method of a surprise attack on Nairen Mountain, it won't work; Our mission is urgent, luring them down the mountain and eating them one by one, it won't work. This is a special battle. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, in strategy, we must despise the enemy, in tactics, we must take the enemy seriously! Comrade Dade, hold another democratic meeting, based on the new situation, let the comrades discuss well. Sun Dade: Yes. (Exits)]

[Yang Zhirong is about to exit. Shao Jianbo: Old Yang, what do you think about attacking Weigongshan? Yang Zhirong: I haven't thought it through. Shao Jianbo: Old Yang, you don't reveal your plan until it's ripe! Yang Zhirong: I want to interrogate One Tuft again, further clarify the situation of the banquet of one hundred chickens at Weigongshan. Shao Jianbo: Yes. I'm waiting for you to come up with an idea. Yang Zhirong: Yes. (Exits) Shao Jianbo: (Singing "Xipi Fast Three Eyes")]

In the past few days, gathering intelligence has been fruitful,
Analyzing carefully, repeatedly considering the battle plan.
Weigongshan relies on the fortifications and secret passages,
It seems that to win, we must use wisdom.
Selecting capable people to disguise as bandits, infiltrating the enemy's heart,
Only then can we achieve internal and external cooperation to destroy the bandit's nest.
This task is as heavy as a thousand pounds, who is the best to send? —
(Thinking, continuing to sing "Xipi Original Plate")
Yang Zhirong has the conditions to take on this responsibility!
He was born a hired farmer, his nature is good,
From a young age, he suffered on the brink of life and death.
His old father was driven to hang himself by the landlord,
His old mother went mad with grief and died in the wilderness.
With a heart full of hatred, he sought the savior,
He found the Communist Party and walked the path of revolution.
(Changing to "Xipi Fast Two-Six")
After joining the army, he vowed to uproot all the roots of exploitation,
He has fought in countless battles, risking his life, achieving many merits.
He once bravely blew up the enemy's fort,
He once burned the enemy's ammunition depot.
He has many times used his wisdom to infiltrate enemy territory to gather intelligence,
He has also rescued many comrades and compatriots from the tiger's den.
Entering the forest, he has dealt with bandits many times,
Captured Luan Ping, caught Hu Biao, and captured One Tuft alive.
This time, if he is sent alone into the dangerous area,
I believe he—
With a heart red as fire, a will as strong as steel, he will surely defeat the stubborn bandit Zuo Maotou.
[Sun Dade enters, comes into the house. Sun Dade: 203! Shao Jianbo: Old Sun, how did the democratic meeting go? Sun Dade: Everyone carefully studied the enemy situation, believing that we can only use wisdom, not force, and must send a comrade to infiltrate the bandit's nest... Shao Jianbo: Right.]

[Yang Zhirong enters, comes in, performs the bandit's salute. Shao Jianbo looks at him, Sun Dade looks at him in surprise. Yang Zhirong: Hu Biao comes to present the map! Shao Jianbo: Hu Biao? Old Yang, have you thought it through? Yang Zhirong: (Smiling and nodding) ... Shao Jianbo: Everyone, sit down and talk. (They sit) Quick, say, what is your idea? Yang Zhirong: 203, attacking Weigongshan, I think it is best to use wisdom. Shao Jianbo: Yes. Yang Zhirong: The enemy's banquet of one hundred chickens is a good opportunity. Shao Jianbo: Have you clarified the situation of the banquet of one hundred chickens? Yang Zhirong: I have. Every year on the night of the lunar New Year's Eve, to celebrate Zuo Maotou's birthday, a banquet of one hundred chickens is set up using one hundred families' chickens. I suggest sending a comrade to infiltrate the enemy's interior, clarifying all the clear and secret passages, then using the banquet of one hundred chickens, gathering all the bandits in the Weigong Hall, using wine to intoxicate... Shao Jianbo: The pursuit team will suddenly attack Weigongshan, catching them off guard! Yang Zhirong: Yes, 203, I am an old scout, let me take on this task. Sun Dade: Comrades also proposed that Old Yang should take on this task. Shao Jianbo: I thought so too. It's truly a coincidence! Hahahaha! Comrade Dade, (hands over the liaison map) you take this map and make a copy, I and Old Yang will discuss it in detail. Sun Dade: Yes! (Exits) Shao Jianbo: Old Yang, you disguise as a bandit, infiltrate Weigongshan, are you confident? Yang Zhirong: I have four favorable conditions. Shao Jianbo: Which four? Let's hear it. Yang Zhirong: First, I am already familiar with the bandits' slang, I have mastered the situation of Nairen Mountain, and I have made full preparations. Shao Jianbo: Second? Yang Zhirong: Xu Damabang has just fallen, I can disguise as his horse keeper Hu Biao; this person is now in our hands, Zuo Maotou has never seen him, there won't be any flaws. Shao Jianbo: (Appreciatively) Good! Yang Zhirong: Third, I bring the liaison map to Zuo Maotou as a gift, I will surely gain his trust. Shao Jianbo: Yes. Yang Zhirong: The fourth condition is the most important... Shao Jianbo: It is the revolutionary soldier's loyalty to the Party and the people! Yang Zhirong: 203, you know me. Shao Jianbo: Old Yang, this task is not like the usual ones! Yang Zhirong: Comrade Jianbo! (Singing "Xipi Original Plate")]

Communist Party members always listen to the Party's call,
Volunteering to take on heavy responsibilities.
With a heart to smash the thousand-year-old chains,
To open the fountain of happiness for the people for generations.
(Changing to "Xipi Flowing Water")
Knowing the journey is full of hardships,
The more hardships, the more we move forward.
No matter how the clouds and winds change,
Revolutionary wisdom can overcome the heavens.
With the determination of Yu Gong moving mountains,
We can break through countless difficulties.
A red heart like a flame,
Turning into a sword to slay the stubborn and evil!
Shao Jianbo: Old Yang, I completely believe in you. You ride Xu Damabang's green-maned horse, according to the route indicated by the hunter Old Chang, go to the northeast... Yang Zhirong: Take a detour up the mountain. Shao Jianbo: After you leave, the pursuit team will move into Jiaopigou, mobilize the masses, practice skiing, actively prepare for battle, and wait for your intelligence! Yang Zhirong: I will place the intelligence according to the mark in the pine forest southwest of Weigongshan. Shao Jianbo: I will send Sun Dade to retrieve the intelligence on the 26th of this month. Yang Zhirong: I guarantee timely delivery. Shao Jianbo: Good. The pursuit team will set out immediately after receiving your intelligence. We will cooperate internally and externally to annihilate Zuo Maotou's stubborn bandit group at Weigongshan! Yang Zhirong: 203, this is a complete battle plan! Let's decide on this. Shao Jianbo: Comrade Zhirong! Be bold, be cautious! (Singing "Xipi Fast Plate")]

Believe you will surely complete the mission,
This matter is crucial to the overall situation.
We must also hold a meeting of the branch committee to discuss and decide,
Use collective wisdom to defeat the enemy. Yang Zhirong: Yes!

[They both "pose."]

[Lights gradually dim, curtain falls.]

**Scene 5: Climbing the Mountain to Fight the Tiger**

[A few days after the previous scene.]

[At the foot of Weigongshan, forest and snow-covered plains. Yang Zhirong: (Singing "Erhuang Reverse Plate")]

Crossing the forest, crossing the snow-covered plains, the spirit soars to the heavens—
[Yang Zhirong is disguised, facing the wind and snow, riding a horse. Yang Zhirong: (Singing "Back Dragon")]

Expressing my heroic spirit and great ambition, facing the mountains.
(Down from the horse)
(Singing "Erhuang Slow Original Plate")
I wish the red flag would fly over the five continents and four seas,
Even if it is a sea of fire and a mountain of knives, I will rush forward.
I wish the flying snow would turn into spring water,
Welcome the spring, change the world.
(Changing to "Xipi Fast Plate")
The Party gives me wisdom and courage,
Thousands of difficulties are nothing.
To fight bandits, first disguise as a bandit,
Like a sharp sword, piercing Weigongshan.
I vow to bury Zuo Maotou in the mountain gorge,
My great ambition shakes the mountains, my heroic spirit shakes the abyss.
Waiting for the day to reunite with my comrades at the banquet of one hundred chickens,
I will destroy the bandit's nest, making the earth cover the sky!
[Tiger roar. Yang Zhirong: Tiger!]

[Yang Zhirong draws his gun and shoots the tiger. The tiger cries out and falls dead. The horse neighs. Yang Zhirong: (Hearing the gunshot, alertly looking towards the sound) Ah, gunshot! The bandits have come down the mountain. (Calmly) Just now, I killed one, now a group has come. You will not escape the fate of destruction!]

[Da Maizi shouts from inside: "Stop!" Da Maizi leads several small bandits. Yang Zhirong stands firmly, greeting the bandits. Da Maizi: "Where are you from, mushroom? What's your business?" Yang Zhirong: (Proudly not answering) ... Small Bandit A: (Seeing the tiger killed by Yang Zhirong) Ah! A tiger!]

[The small bandits retreat in fear. Yang Zhirong: Haha, what courage! That is a dead tiger. Small Bandit A: (Looking around) Great shooting! The skull is shattered! Da Maizi: Did you kill it? Yang Zhirong: It ran into my gun. Da Maizi: What's your weapon? Yang Zhirong: Don't be afraid. (Throws the gun to Small Bandit A) Da Maizi: Good! Which mountain are you from? What are you doing here? Yang Zhirong: (Counter-questioning) Judging by your appearance, you are from Weigongshan? Da Maizi: What do you think? (Realizing his slip) Hmm! Who are you from? Yang Zhirong: You don't need to ask. I want to see Commander Chu, I have important news to report. Da Maizi: You don't even know the mountain rules? You are not a spy, you are a traitor! Yang Zhirong: Even if I am a traitor, I wouldn't dare to barge into Weigongshan! Da Maizi: "What? What?"]

[Yang Zhirong does not answer. Small Bandit A: Speak! Yang Zhirong: (Proudly) Unless you see Commander Chu, you won't get anything out of me! Da Maizi: Good! Let's go! (Holds the gun)]

[Yang Zhirong signals to carry the tiger and lead the horse, walking proudly, exits. Da Maizi: Carry the tiger, lead the horse!]

[The bandits carry the tiger and lead the horse.]

[Curtain falls.]

**Scene 6: Entering the Bandit's Lair**

[Immediately following the previous scene.]

[The curtain opens with a dull drumbeat.]

[Inside the Weigong Hall, lights are bright. Zuo Maotou sits on a tiger skin chair. The "Eight Gold Justices" stand disorderly on both sides. Several small bandits stand in the back left of the hall.]

[Zuo Maotou signals Da Maizi to bring people in. Da Maizi: The Third Uncle orders, bring in the spy! Several small bandits: Bring in the spy!]

[Yang Zhirong walks in proudly. Yang Zhirong: (Singing "Xipi Fast Plate")]

Although I enter the dragon's den alone,
Millions of class brothers are by my side.
No matter how fierce Zuo Maotou's flames are,
For the people, I fight the devil with a brave heart and strong will.
[Yang Zhirong walks forward, performing the bandit's salute. Zuo Maotou: (Suddenly) "Heavenly King covers the earth tiger!" Yang Zhirong: "Pagoda subdues the river demon!" Bandit Gold Justice: "What? What?" Yang Zhirong: "At noon, who has a home?" Zuo Maotou: "Why is your face red?" Yang Zhirong: "Spirit is vibrant!" Zuo Maotou: "Why is it yellow now?" Yang Zhirong: "Wax to keep warm!"]

[Zuo Maotou uses his gun to extinguish a lamp. Yang Zhirong takes the gun from Da Maizi and extinguishes two lamps. The bandits whisper. Zuo Maotou: According to what you say, you are a man of Commander Xu? Yang Zhirong: Commander Xu's horse keeper, Hu Biao! Zuo Maotou: Hu Biao? Since you are a man of Commander Xu, I'll ask you, when did you follow Commander Xu? Yang Zhirong: When he was the police chief. Zuo Maotou: I heard Commander Xu has a few favorite things? Yang Zhirong: Two treasures. Zuo Maotou: Which two treasures? Yang Zhirong: A good horse and a fast knife. Zuo Maotou: What kind of horse? Yang Zhirong: A curly-maned green horse. Zuo Maotou: What kind of knife? Yang Zhirong: A Japanese command knife. Zuo Maotou: Who gave it? Yang Zhirong: Given by the Imperial Army. Zuo Maotou: Where? Yang Zhirong: Mudanjiang's Five Blessings Tower. Zuo Maotou: (Pausing) Since you are Commander Xu's horse keeper, why didn't I see you at the meeting called by Commissioner Hou last time? Yang Zhirong: Commander Chu, I, Hu Biao, am just a servant in Commander Xu's camp. How can I compare to someone like Deputy Commander Luan Ping, who is always in the spotlight? Zuo Maotou: What do you plan to do coming to Weigongshan? Yang Zhirong: To seek Commander Chu, to rise step by step. Today, I am just at the doorstep, and the elders are so distrustful of me, isn't that a bit unrighteous? Zuo Maotou: Hehehehe! This is also for the safety of the mountain. (Signaling, Gold Justice A offers wine, Gold Justice B offers a pipe, Yang Zhirong receives them with bandit etiquette.) You came to me, even if you are at the end of your rope, you must have a gift for your visit. Yang Zhirong: I brought Commander Xu's treasure horse; at the foot of the mountain, relying on your prestige, I also captured a magnificent tiger! Bandit Gold Justice: The Third Uncle's fiftieth birthday, someone presents a treasure. (Everyone laughs.) Zuo Maotou: Hu Biao, when did Nairen Mountain fall? Yang Zhirong: The third day of the twelfth lunar month. Zuo Maotou: Why did you take so many days to come? Yang Zhirong: Commander Chu, this trip was not easy for me. Nairen Mountain was attacked, I escaped from the Lantern Tower, and hid in the Pear Orchard for a few days. Zuo Maotou: The Pear Orchard? Yang Zhirong: Luan Ping's maternal uncle's place. Zuo Maotou: Did you see Luan Ping? Yang Zhirong: I saw him. Zuo Maotou: What about One Tuft? Yang Zhirong: One Tuft? I didn't see him. Zuo Maotou: Didn't see him? One Tuft has been down the mountain for more than half a month, why hasn't he returned? Hu Biao, you came, but where is Luan Ping? Yang Zhirong: Luan Ping? Sigh! Don't mention it. Zuo Maotou: What happened? Yang Zhirong: I...]

[Zuo Maotou signals, the small bandits retreat. Zuo Maotou: Hu Biao, what happened to Deputy Commander Luan? Yang Zhirong: (Pounding his fist) It's hard to explain! (Singing "Xipi Small Reverse Plate")]

Mentioning Luan Ping, I can't control my anger—
Zuo Maotou: What happened to him? Yang Zhirong: (Continuing to sing "Xipi Original Plate")
He doesn't care about the "righteousness" that comes first in the world of Jianghu.
Zuo Maotou: Eh, that Luan is an outsider, why doesn't he keep his word? Yang Zhirong: (Continuing to sing)
Nairen Mountain was attacked, we two barely escaped,
I advised him to change his allegiance and seek refuge in Weigongshan.
[The bandit Gold Justices are pleased. Zuo Maotou: Did he come? Yang Zhirong: (Continuing to sing)
People have their own aspirations and cannot be forced,
He shouldn't—
He shouldn't speak evil and boast. Zuo Maotou: What did he say? Yang Zhirong: He said... Zuo Maotou: (Eagerly) Old Hu, you say, you say quickly! Yang Zhirong: (Continuing to sing)
Zuo Maotou also has to listen to Commissioner Hou's orders! Zuo Maotou: (Angrily) What? I listen to his orders? Bandit Gold Justice: To hell with him, what nonsense! Yang Zhirong: Luan Ping has more to say! Bandit Gold Justice: What did he say? Yang Zhirong: (Continuing to sing)
The Eight Gold Justices are nameless rats, not worth mentioning. Bandit Gold Justice: (Angrily) What? This little bastard! Yang Zhirong: (Singing "Xipi Flowing Water")
He boasted that he would occupy the high branch like a phoenix,
Commissioner Hou's tree is big and deep-rooted, it is his support. Bandit Gold Justice: (Interrupting) To hell with him! Yang Zhirong: (Continuing to sing)
While speaking, he took out a map—
(Changing to "Xipi Shake Plate")
A scroll! Zuo Maotou: (Interrupting) A map? Yang Zhirong:
(Changing to "Xipi Flowing Water")
He presented the treasure map to Commissioner Hou, he would surely be promoted. Zuo Maotou: Is it the liaison map? Yang Zhirong: Yes, it is the secret liaison map. Zuo Maotou: (Anxiously) So, he presented the liaison map to Commissioner Hou? Yang Zhirong: You don't need to worry.
(Singing "Xipi Shake Plate")
He was so pleased, his eyes were squinting,
From the house, he brought out—
(Changing to "Xipi Flowing Water")
A jar of wine.
I poured him eight big bowls,
Luan Ping was drunk like mud.
At that time, I thought, once started, finish it!
Bandit Gold Justice: Right, seize it! Yang Zhirong: At that time, taking advantage of his unconsciousness, I... Zuo Maotou: Killed him! Yang Zhirong: No, we are old friends! Zuo Maotou: (Changing his words) Right, right, friendship is important, friendship is important. Old Hu, continue. Yang Zhirong: He had his plans, I had mine. Zuo Maotou: What did you do? Yang Zhirong: I—
(Continuing to sing)
I took the opportunity to change his clothes,
Rode the green-maned horse, through the heavy snow,
In one breath, I rushed up Weigongshan. Zuo Maotou: So, the liaison map is in your hands? Yang Zhirong: (Smiling lightly) Hahaha!
(Continuing to sing)
Commander Chu, please look up,
The treasure map is presented to you.
[Zuo Maotou takes the map, looks at it, the bandits gather to look. Bandit Gold Justice: Old Hu is amazing! A hero! Zuo Maotou: (Ecstatically) Hahahaha!
(Singing "Xipi Scattered Plate")]

The liaison map has been in my mind day and night,
I have longed for it for a long time.

**My ambition is unfulfilled, I will not rest.**

**The future is long, I will show my prowess,**

**I am willing to shed my blood to write the annals of history.**

**[Yang Zirong, with a victorious smile, drinks the wine in one gulp.**

**[Lights dim, curtain falls]**

**Scene 7: Mobilizing the Masses**

**[Jiangpi Valley. Inside and outside Li Yongqi's home. There is an inner room. The wall has burn marks.**

**[Midday. Wind and snow are raging.**

**[Li's mother is at the stove, lifting the lid to find nothing, shaking her head in despair. A gust of wind blows, she shivers and walks to the table.**

**Li's Mother: (singing)**

**The wind and snow pierce the walls, cold to the bone,**

**Clothes are thin, food is exhausted, worries kill a person.**

**Calling for my son and daughter-in-law, no response,**

**Blood-deep hatred, difficult to avenge.**

**[Zhang Dashan enters. Zhang Dashan: Auntie.**

**Li's Mother: Dashan!**

**[Li's mother opens the door, Zhang Dashan enters the house.**

**Zhang Dashan: Auntie, are you feeling better today?**

**Li's Mother: I woke up this morning, my head is even more dizzy.**

**Zhang Dashan: Your illness, Auntie, is due to both hunger and worry. I have some sweet potatoes at home, you can eat a bit to ease your hunger.**

**Li's Mother: Dashan, always causing trouble for you, I really feel bad.**

**Zhang Dashan: Auntie, when Yongqi is here, he takes care of you; when he is not here, we all will.**

**[Zhang Dashan starts boiling water.**

**[Li's mother takes the sweet potatoes into the inner room.**

**[Li Yongqi enters, pushing the door open. Zhang Dashan: (startled) Yongqi!**

**Li Yongqi: Dashan!**

**[Li's mother comes out from the inner room. Li Yongqi: Mom!**

**Li's Mother: Yong—qi—!**

**[Li's Mother: (singing)**

**Is it a dream that I meet my son again?**

**You are covered in wounds, how can my heart not ache?**

**After you left, I cried until my eyes were dry, and I fell ill with worry!**

**Li Yongqi: (continuing)**

**In the bandit den, day and night I think of my mother.**

**Li's Mother: (continuing)**

**My illness is thanks to—**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**The kindness of the neighbors.**

**Li Yongqi: (continuing)**

**Thank you, neighbors, for your deep affection!**

**Zhang Dashan: (continuing)**

**It is our duty.**

**Li's Mother: (continuing)**

**How did you escape the den of wolves?**

**Li Yongqi: (continuing)**

**Jumping off cliffs, crossing mountains, breaking through the pack.**

**Li's Mother: (continuing)**

**Mother and son reunite, joy and sorrow intertwined,**

**The more joyful, the more I miss my daughter-in-law and grandchildren!**

**Li Yongqi: (singing)**

**Countless grievances, countless hatreds,**

**Every drop is etched in my heart.**

**Today, I am alive,**

**Tomorrow, I will fight my enemies with all my might!**

**[The crowd outside shouts: "The soldiers are coming to the village!" Zhang Dashan: Ah! Is Seatshan Tao coming again? Li Yongqi: Are they coming after me? Zhang Dashan: You hide for a moment, I'll go see. (exits) Li's Mother: What should we do now! Li Yongqi: If they are really coming after me, I will fight to the death! Li's Mother: Child, if you have another accident, how will I live? You should hide! Li Yongqi: Hide? Mom, where can I hide? I am determined to fight to the death! Today, I will fight to the death, and if I win, I will gain one! Li's Mother: Yongqi, this is not good!**

**[Dong Zhongsong and Li Hongyi enter. Li Hongyi: Let's go to this house and check. Dong Zhongsong: (knocks on the door) Is there anyone home? Li Yongqi: Yes! We are still alive here! Li's Mother: Yongqi! Dong Zhongsong: Fellow villagers, please open the door!**

**[Li Yongqi suddenly opens the door, and with a gust of cold wind, Dong Zhongsong and Li Hongyi enter the house.**

**[Dong Zhongsong closes the door.**

**[Li's mother is startled, protecting Li Yongqi. Li Hongyi: Old lady, don't be afraid, we are... Li Yongqi: Less talk! Dong Zhongsong: Fellow villager, don't misunderstand! We are the People's Liberation Army! Li Yongqi: The Liberation Army? (looking them over) I've seen many kinds of "army," who knows what kind of "army" you are! What do you want, just say it! Want money, we have none! Want food, it has all been looted! Want our lives... Li Hongyi: We, the Liberation Army, are the people's children, we protect the common people! Li Yongqi: Easy to say! Li's Mother: Yongqi! You... (feels dizzy) Li Hongyi: Old lady, are you sick? We will find someone to come and see you. Li Yongqi: Forget it! (supports Li's mother into the inner room)**

**[Dong Zhongsong signals to Li Hongyi, they both exit the door, closing it behind them.**

**[Shaojianbo and Gaobo enter. Shaojianbo: What's the situation? Dong Zhongsong: We've checked a few houses, all are the same. This family has the most resentment! Li Hongyi: This family has an old lady who is sick! Shaojianbo: Oh, Li Hongyi, quickly call the medic and bring some food! Li Hongyi: Yes! (exits) Dong Zhongsong: Sigh! The mass work here is really difficult! Shaojianbo: What, little Dong, impatient again? The people of Jiangpi Valley don't understand us, they may have been deceived before. Don't you remember, one hairball even impersonated our scouts? As long as they understand, this resentment will turn into a great force! Dong Zhongsong: I know, but... Shaojianbo: Little Dong, you must care about the people's hardships. You must understand: if we do not mobilize the masses, we cannot stand firm, defeat Seatshan Tao; if we do not defeat the bandits, the masses cannot truly be mobilized. Dong Zhongsong: I understand. Shaojianbo: Go tell everyone to patiently propagate the Party's policies, strictly follow the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention, and open the situation with actual actions! Dong Zhongsong: Yes! (turns to leave) Shaojianbo: Hey, by the way, has the hunter Old Chang arrived? Dong Zhongsong: Yes! (exits)**

**[Bai Ru enters. Bai Ru: Shaojianbo, the food is here. (hands over the food bag) Where is the patient? Shaojianbo: In this house. Bai Ru, let's go see! Bai Ru: Yes! (knocks on the door) Fellow villagers! Shaojianbo: Fellow villagers, our doctor is here. Please open the door!**

**[Li Yongqi, holding a dagger, angrily enters; Li's mother follows, trying to stop him. Li's Mother: Yongqi, you... Li Yongqi: What are you afraid of? With this, I can fight them! (stabs the dagger into the table) Li's Mother: (shocked) Yongqi, I beg you! (faints) Li Yongqi: (rushes to support her) Mom! Mom!**

**[Shaojianbo forcefully opens the door, with Bai Ru and Gaobo entering.**

**[Li Yongqi protects Li's mother, glaring at Shaojianbo. Shaojianbo: Bai Ru, quickly give emergency treatment!**

**[Bai Ru takes off her coat and puts it on Li's mother, supporting her into the inner room; Li Yongqi and Gaobo follow.**

**[Shaojianbo pours some food from the bag into the pot, cooking porridge.**

**[After a while. Li Yongqi comes out from the inner room, fetching water.**

**Shaojianbo enters the inner room. Li Yongqi: (notices the porridge, thinking) The Liberation Army?**

**[Li Yongqi: (singing)**

**These soldiers, difficult to treat, save lives and cure diseases,**

**They ask about the cold and warmth, and are very kind.**

**From ancient times, soldiers and bandits are one family, oppressing the people,**

**Today's matter makes one suspicious!**

**Are these really the saviors we have been waiting for?**

**[Li's Mother: (from inside) Water!**

**[Li Yongqi scoops the porridge; Gaobo comes out from the inner room, takes the porridge, and re-enters. Shaojianbo comes out from the inner room. Shaojianbo: Fellow villager, the old lady is awake, her illness is not serious, you can rest assured! Li Yongqi: Oh... Shaojianbo: Fellow villager, what is your name? What do you do? Li Yongqi: Li Yongqi. Originally a railway worker. Shaojianbo: A worker? Good! Even more of our own people! How long have you lived here? Li Yongqi: Already two generations. Shaojianbo: How many people are in your family? Li Yongqi: (emotionally touched, unable to speak) Sigh! Shaojianbo: (taking the food bag) Fellow villager, I heard you have no food, here is some... (seeing Li Yongqi not taking it; places it on the table, noticing the dagger) Fellow villager, you don't need this with us! We are all one family! Li Yongqi: (carefully examining Shaojianbo) What kind of troops are you? What are you doing in the deep mountains? Shaojianbo: Fellow villager!**

**[Shaojianbo: (singing)**

**We are the children of workers and peasants, coming to the deep mountains,**

**To eliminate the reactionaries and change the world.**

**For decades, we have fought revolutions across the country,**

**The Communist Party and Chairman Mao guide us forward.**

**A red star on our heads,**

**Revolutionary red flags on both sides.**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**The red flag points, the dark clouds disperse,**

**The people of the liberated areas overthrow the landlords and turn the world upside down.**

**The people's army shares hardships with the people,**

**We are here to sweep away Wuhu Mountain!**

**Li Yongqi: (excitedly, singing)**

**Early and late, I have been waiting, my eyes are sore from waiting,**

**Who would have thought that today, fighting bandits, entering the deep mountains,**

**Saving the poor, relieving suffering, our own troops have come**

**To my face!**

**Dear comrades! I should not have confused right and wrong,**

**I should not have mistaken comrades for enemies—shameful and hard to speak!**

**For thirty years, I have been a slave, the sun and moon have not been seen,**

**Stroking these wounds and scars, I suppress my anger, struggling in the bottomless abyss.**

**The villagers' grief and anger are difficult to express,**

**The villagers' hatred and resentment are directed at Wuhu Mountain.**

**Only saying it is a bitter time without end,**

**Who would have thought that the iron tree would bloom, the withered branches would sprout leaves today!**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**From now on, I will follow the Communist Party to drive away the wolves,**

**No matter if it is in water or fire, I am willing to die!**

**Even with a thousand difficulties and ten thousand dangers,**

**[Turning to a slower rhythm]**

**I will sweep away Wuhu Mountain, I will be the first!**

**[Shaojianbo shakes Li Yongqi's hand.**

**[Bai Ru and Gaobo support Li's mother out from the inner room. Li's Mother: Yongqi, this girl has cured my illness! Li Yongqi: They even brought us food. Li's Mother: (gratefully) ...**

**[Shaojianbo helps Li's mother sit down.**

**[Li Hongyi enters. Li Hongyi: Shaojianbo, the villagers are looking for you!**

**[The crowd, with soldiers, enters. Dong Zhongsong and Zhang Dashan escort the hunter Old Chang and Chang Bao to the front. Dong Zhongsong: (to Old Chang) This is our commander. Shaojianbo: (welcoming, shaking Old Chang's hand) You are the hunter Old Chang? Coming from the mountains? Old Chang: The valley is unbearable, my son and I came to seek refuge with you, Uncle Zhang. Shaojianbo: (patting Chang Bao's shoulder) Good girl! Old Chang: You guessed it! Li Yongqi: Uncle Chang! Old Chang: Yongqi! Auntie! We have finally seen the saviors! Zhang Dashan: Commander, everyone in the village is eager to fight Wuhu Mountain! Shaojianbo: Fellow villagers! Our People's Liberation Army has won a great victory on the front line! Mudanjiang is also liberated! Seatshan Tao has nowhere to run! Zhang Dashan: Let's raid his lair. Commander, quickly give us guns! The crowd: Yes, quickly give us guns! Li Yongqi: If we have guns, everyone in Jiangpi Valley can handle him three or two at a time. Shaojianbo: Guns will definitely be given to everyone! (touching the villagers' tattered clothes) But now, fellow villagers, you have no warm clothes, no food for the night, can you go to the deep mountains to fight the bandits? The crowd: What should we do then? Shaojianbo: Jiangpi Valley has medicinal herbs everywhere, and wood as high as mountains. As long as the small forest train starts running, we can exchange for clothes and food! Old Chang: Yes, as the saying goes, "When the train whistles, the granary is full; when the train starts, food and clothing come." The crowd: Sigh! This is what everyone has been waiting for! Actually, "When the train whistles, Seatshan Tao comes to loot; the poor people are impoverished, the Nationalists are enriched." Li Yongqi: Uncle, now we have the Liberation Army, ten Seatshan Taos are not afraid! Shaojianbo: Yes! With us here, everyone can organize the militia, the small train will definitely run; with food and clothing, fighting Seatshan Tao will be even more powerful! Li Yongqi: When will we start building the railway? Shaojianbo: Say do and do, let's start together. Zhang Dashan: Commander, this is a hard job! Dong Zhongsong: Hey! Do you think we are all gentlemen? We are all from poor backgrounds, pick up a gun and we can be soldiers, pick up a tool and we can work! Li Yongqi: Good! Commander! We are truly one family!**

**[Li Yongqi: (singing)**

**The mountain people keep their word,**

**A sincere heart to the sky!**

**Follow you into the deep sea,**

**Follow you up the high mountain.**

**A thunderclap shakes the earth!**

**Seatshan Tao!**

**[The crowd: (singing)**

**Look at you, how many more days can you live!**

**[Lights dim, curtain falls]**

**Scene 8: Sending the Intelligence**

**[Dawn. A relatively flat area on Wuhu Mountain. This is a three-way junction, to the right is the main road down the mountain, far away there are watchtowers standing; to the left rear is the way to Yang Zirong's residence, to the left front is the way to Wuhu Hall.**

**[Curtain rises. Seatshan Tao and Big Pockmark are on stage, walking from the left front side curtain. Seatshan Tao: Does the Ninth Elder often exercise here? Big Pockmark: Yes. Seatshan Tao: Where else has he been? Big Pockmark: He has visited all five mountain peaks. Seatshan Tao: What! You let the Ninth Elder see all twenty-seven forts? Big Pockmark: He is our own brother, just showing him around! Seatshan Tao: Sigh! Big Pockmark: Third Uncle, the Ninth Elder is clever and strong, loyal and sincere. Why are you so suspicious?**

**[Tadpole Nose enters from the right. Tadpole Nose: Third Uncle, everything is prepared as you instructed. Seatshan Tao: Good! Whether he is genuine or not, we will give him a decisive test! Big Pockmark: Third Uncle, the Ninth Elder is quite capable, loyal to you. If we handle it wrong, it won't be good. Tadpole Nose: Big Brother, you haven't had much interaction with him before. As the saying goes, "Know the person, know the face, but not the heart." Seatshan Tao: Right! Chief of Staff, none of us have seen the Ninth Elder before. — Deputy Chief of Staff, carry out the plan. Tadpole Nose: Yes. (exits to the right)**

**[Seatshan Tao and Big Pockmark seem to notice something, hurriedly exit to the left front.**

**[Yang Zirong: (singing inside)**

**Chopping through thorns, fighting in the enemy's heart!**

**[Yang Zirong: (singing)**

**Looking at the distant friends, the military and people are ready to fight,**

**The more the wolves fight, the more my fighting spirit soars!**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**The Party has high hopes for me,**

**The meeting of the committee, comrades speak with deep concern.**

**Thousands of reminders, ten thousand instructions give me strength,**

**A fiery heart warms my chest.**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**Be bold and cautious, remember in your heart,**

**Rely on bravery and wisdom.**

**The Party's words are a guarantee of victory,**

**Mao Zedong Thought shines forever.**

**[Turning to a slower rhythm]**

**Wuhu Mountain is indeed a layer of screens,**

**Open forts and secret tunnels are set up everywhere.**

**The leadership has planned a clever strategy,**

**If we attack strongly, we will suffer heavy losses.**

**For seven days, I have investigated the enemy's situation thoroughly,**

**Secretly writing the military intelligence, hiding it on my body.**

**Taking advantage of dawn to send the intelligence, pretending to be idle,**

**Why suddenly increase the number of guards—**

**[Turning to a slower rhythm]**

**The situation is abnormal!**

**[Yang Zirong: (continuing)**

**This intelligence—**

**[Yang Zirong: (continuing)**

**This intelligence cannot be delayed, it will miss the opportunity, destroy the plan,**

**I am sorry to the people, I am sorry to the Party,**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**New Year's Eve is near, I cannot hesitate.**

**Through the forest of knives and the forest of swords, I will break through,**

**Eliminate all difficulties, go down the mountain.**

**The mountain is high, it cannot block the road,**

**I will overcome the cold and turn the ice and snow into sunshine in my heart.**

**[Thinking] Today is the twenty-sixth, this intelligence must be sent out!**

**[Someone's voice inside: "Hey, hurry up! This is coming!"**

**[Yang Zirong is alert, takes off his cloak, practices martial arts to cover up.**

**[Two small bandits enter, patrolling, greeting Yang Zirong, and exit.**

**[Yang Zirong finishes his practice.**

**[Gunshots. Yang Zirong: Gunshots!**

**[Far away, shouting: "Charge! Kill!" Nearby shouting: "The Communists are coming! The Communists are coming!"**

**[The gunshots are intense. Yang Zirong: What! Are the comrades coming? No, Shaojianbo cannot get my intelligence and will not come.**

**[The gunshots are even more intense, the shouting is closer. Yang Zirong: The gunshots are wrong! Hmm, another test! I will give him a counterattack, sending the intelligence out. (shouting to the left) Brothers!**

**[Four small bandits enter. Yang Zirong: The Communists are coming, follow me to attack!**

**[The four small bandits charge down. Seatshan Tao and Big Pockmark secretly enter.**

**[Tadpole Nose welcomes them. Seatshan Tao: Ninth Elder, stop. Yang Zirong: (shouting to the right) Stop! Tadpole Nose: (simultaneously shouting to the right) Don't shoot!**

**[The four small bandits inside respond: "Ah!" Yang Zirong: What's going on? Seatshan Tao: This is my arranged military exercise. Yang Zirong: Ah, if you hadn't stopped in time, this burst of bullets would have knocked down a few. Seatshan Tao: Ha ha ha! Yang Zirong: Third Uncle, why didn't you tell the Ninth Elder about this military exercise? You are... Seatshan Tao: Ha ha, Ninth Elder, don't be suspicious. This exercise, no one was told, you can ask him. Tadpole Nose: Yes, I thought the Communists were coming too. Yang Zirong: Ha ha, coming is good, I am waiting for them here! Seatshan Tao: Ninth Elder, you are really something! Ha ha ha! The bandit company commander: (inside) Go.**

**[The bandit company commander pushes a small bandit onto the stage. The bandit company commander: Third Uncle, the scout hit the wall! Seatshan Tao: What? Big Pockmark: How could he hit the wall? Small Bandit: (trembling) Third Uncle, we were ordered to go down the mountain, from afar we saw the small train running; we hadn't even entered Jiangpi Valley, and we encountered the Communists! Seatshan Tao: Jiangpi Valley? (thinking) How many people? Small Bandit: Many, many, there are hundreds of them! Seatshan Tao: (skeptical) Just you came back? Tadpole Nose: You must have been captured by the Communists and released, right? Small Bandit: No, no! Seatshan Tao: (drawing his gun, threatening the small bandit) You coward! Yang Zirong: (intervening) Third Uncle, why bother. If he was really captured by the Communists, he wouldn't dare come back. Big Pockmark: Yes, everyone knows that Third Uncle hates those captured by the Communists! Seatshan Tao: Hmm! Yang Zirong: (to the small bandit) Still not running, provoking Third Uncle's anger. Small Bandit: Yes! Big Pockmark: Get out! Small Bandit: (to the side, softly) It's still the Ninth Elder who is good. (exits) Big Pockmark: (to the bandit company commander) Order below to strengthen the mountain defense. Bandit Company Commander: Yes. (exits) Seatshan Tao: Again, my mountain's prestige is ruined, I will not rest! Big Pockmark: Third Uncle, there are only a few days left until New Year's Eve, I will send someone down the mountain to capture a few, also to boost the mountain's prestige, celebrate the Hundred Chicken Banquet. Seatshan Tao: Good is good, but the Communists are not to be trifled with, we cannot go into the village. Hmm, the small train is running, we will first attack the small train outside the village! Big Pockmark: Understood. (exits) Yang Zirong: (thinking) Third Uncle, the Communists in Jiangpi Valley are probably aiming at us. Our Wuhu Mountain, if we talk about defense, there is no doubt. But we cannot just wait for others to attack us. Seatshan Tao: In your opinion, what should we do? Yang Zirong: As the saying goes, "The first to strike is the strongest." We should practice pursuit now, train the troops well, and after the Hundred Chicken Banquet, attack Jiangpi Valley! Seatshan Tao: (delighted) Ninth Elder, you are truly a hero! Ha ha ha!**

**[Seatshan Tao: (singing)**

**You are wise and brave, with extraordinary abilities,**

**In the entire mountain, you are the first.**

**To me, you are truly loyal and sincere—**

**Ninth Elder, I will send you to lead the brothers in the pursuit exercise. Yang Zirong: Yes. Seatshan Tao: (continuing)**

**From now on, I will ensure your step-by-step promotion.**

**Ha ha ha!**

**[Seatshan Tao and Tadpole Nose exit. Yang Zirong: This fool!**

**[Yang Zirong: (singing)**

**Seatshan Tao is cunning and deceitful, pretending to be clever,**

**The trick backfires, giving me an opportunity to take advantage.**

**Eagerly sending the intelligence, walking boldly forward—**

**Seatshan Tao wants to raid Jiangpi Valley, destroy the small train,**

**I must add a note to the intelligence—**

**Reach the comrades! (continuing)**

**Following the signal to receive the intelligence, it all depends on you!**

**[Curtain falls]**

**Scene 9: Rapid Deployment**

**[The morning of a certain day before New Year's Eve. In the sound of the train whistle, the curtain rises. Outside Li Yongqi's house in the courtyard of Jiangpi Valley.**

**[The villagers of Jiangpi Valley, with bags of grain on their backs, watch the train leave, joyfully descend.**

**[Li's mother puts down the bag of grain. Li's Mother: (singing)**

**The military and people are one family, hearts connected,**

**Joyous scenes fill the village.**

**The auspicious snow falls, people laugh,**

**Sharing clothes and food, celebrating liberation.**

**[Shaojianbo enters. Shaojianbo: Auntie, do you have enough to eat and use at the end of the year? Li's Mother: Enough. Jiangpi Valley can have such a good year, I never dreamed of it! If it weren't for you here, who knows how we would spend the year! Shaojianbo: The good days are still ahead. Li's Mother: All thanks to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! Shaojianbo: I will carry it into the house for you. Li's Mother: I will do it.**

**[Shaojianbo carries the grain. Li Yongqi enters. Li Yongqi: Commander!**

**[Li's mother takes the grain from Shaojianbo's hands, enters the house. Shaojianbo: Yongqi. Li Yongqi: Commander, after sending away the prisoners Lan Ping and One Hairball, the reinforcements have arrived. It seems that the attack on Wuhu Mountain is imminent, right? Shaojianbo: Yes. Seatshan Tao will not live long. Li Yongqi: Finally, the day has come! Shaojianbo: The militia has been arranged, right? Li Yongqi: Arranged. As you said, the militia is divided into two groups, one group stays to protect the village, one group is ready to set out with the troops. The guide is me! Shaojianbo: It all depends on you, the militia commander! Yongqi, you are familiar with the mountain roads of Wuhu Mountain. This time, you must exert yourself. Li Yongqi: What are you saying, fighting Seatshan Tao is our duty. Our militia, hearing that we are fighting Seatshan Tao, all want to go, especially Chang Bao, insisting on not staying behind, no matter what we say. Shaojianbo: Ha, this girl really has spirit! Yongqi, protecting the village is also important, you go talk to her. Li Yongqi: Yes.**

**[Li Yongqi exits.**

**[Shaojianbo paces back and forth, thinking. Li Hongyi and Dong Zhongsong enter. Dong Zhongsong: Shaojianbo, New Year's Eve is coming soon. Sun Dade has not returned with the intelligence, do we just wait? Shaojianbo: What do you think? Dong Zhongsong: We have undergone skiing training, our speed has reached the standard requirements, and there is Li Yongqi to guide... Li Hongyi: Besides, the higher-ups have sent us reinforcement troops, and supplemented our supplies and ammunition... Dong Zhongsong: In my opinion, if the intelligence does not come, we can set out immediately and still win! Shaojianbo: Comrade!**

**[Shaojianbo: (singing)**

**Seatshan Tao cannot escape his doomed fate,**

**Encountering difficulties, do not be impatient, be patient.**

**Return to the barracks, prepare, await orders—**

**Dong Zhongsong: Yes.**

**[Dong Zhongsong and Li Hongyi exit. Shaojianbo: (continuing)**

**Although I advise them, my heart is also restless!**

**Seeing the time fly like an arrow, the date is approaching,**

**Sun Dade has not returned with the intelligence.**

**If something happens—**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**I have another plan,**

**The Hundred Chicken Banquet is a good opportunity, it will not change.**

**Li Yongqi provides that the back mountain has a dangerous path,**

**We will take a detour, cross the dangerous peak, and directly attack Wuhu Hall.**

**[Li Yongqi and Old Chang enter. Li Yongqi: Commander, everything is ready, are we setting out now? Shaojianbo: Wait a moment. Yongqi, if we take the dangerous path behind Wuhu Mountain, can we really arrive in one day and one night? Li Yongqi: Taking the back mountain is eighty li farther than the front mountain, but the bandits have not set up defenses. According to the comrades' skiing speed, one day and one night is guaranteed to arrive. Old Chang: The back mountain is full of cliffs and steep walls, it's difficult to climb! Shaojianbo: Old Chang, no matter how difficult, it cannot stop the People's Liberation Army!**

**[Old Chang is about to speak to Shaojianbo, Chang Bao and Bai Ru enter. Chang Bao: Uncle, I have been requesting to join the attack on Wuhu Mountain. Today, we are setting out, why do you insist on leaving me behind? Shaojianbo: Protecting the village is also the responsibility of the militia! Chang Bao: I hate Seatshan Tao to the core, I must kill him with my own hands. Not letting me go, how can that be! Shaojianbo: Ha, you have a grudge against me! Chang Bao, you are still young. Chang Bao: I am still young? I am already sixteen! Look, I am not much shorter than her (points to Bai Ru). Bai Ru sister... Bai Ru: Shaojianbo, Chang Bao has class consciousness, she skis well, shoots accurately, and can help me take care of the wounded, let her go. Shaojianbo: Good, you two are of one mind! Old Chang: Commander, please let her go. Shaojianbo: Yongqi, what do you think? Li Yongqi: That's it. Shaojianbo: Good. Since the militia commander has approved, go prepare. Chang Bao: Yes! (jumps for joy)**

**[Chang Bao and Old Chang exit.**

**[Lan Chaojia enters. Lan Chaojia: Shaojianbo, Old Sun has returned!**

**[Sun Dade enters. Shaojianbo: (approaching) Dade! Sun Dade: Report! (hands over the intelligence) Intelligence! Shaojianbo: (taking the intelligence) Finally, you have returned. Are you tired? Go rest.**

**[Lan Chaojia, Sun Dade, Bai Ru, and Li Yongqi exit. Shaojianbo: (eagerly looking at the intelligence) "...the back mountain has a dangerous path directly to Wuhu Hall, the enemy's defensive strength is weak... using the pine tree as a signal..." (excitedly) Old Yang, hero!**

**[Li Yongqi enters. Shaojianbo: Yongqi, is the dangerous path behind the mountain the one that directly goes to Wuhu Hall? Li Yongqi: Yes, it directly goes to Wuhu Hall. Shaojianbo: Leading the way depends on you! Li Yongqi: Commander, rest assured, I ran away from Wuhu Mountain this way, I am familiar with this path. Shaojianbo: Good. You go gather the militia, prepare to set out. Li Yongqi: Yes. (shouting to all directions) Militia, gather! Militia, gather! (exits)**

**[The militia gradually enters. Shaojianbo: (looking closely at the intelligence) "...the bandits will raid Jiangpi Valley in the next few days, destroy the small train!"**

**[A surprised] Ah!**

**[Gao Bo shouts from inside: "Shaojianbo—"**

**[Gao Bo rushes in.**

**[Soldiers, Zhang Dashan, Old Chang, Li's mother, and the crowd rush in. Gao Bo: Report, Shaojianbo, the small train reached Erdaohe, the bridge was destroyed, we got off the train to repair it, but we were attacked by the bandits. We repelled the enemy, but the small train was blown up! Shaojianbo: What about the two prisoners? Gao Bo: One Hairball was blown up! Shaojianbo: What about Lan Ping? Gao Bo: We chased the bandits, Lan Ping ran away! Shaojianbo: Lan Ping ran away? If he runs to Wuhu Mountain, he will definitely cause danger to Comrade Yang Zirong, disrupting our anti-bandit plan! — Lan Chaojia, gather! Lan Chaojia: Yes! (exits) Shaojianbo: Dashan, the aftermath of the small train is left to you and Old Chang. Zhang Dashan: Yes.**

**[The pursuit team and militia enter. Shaojianbo: Comrades!**

**[Shaojianbo: (singing)**

**Only fear that the plan will become a bubble,**

**Urgent, every second counts.**

**Comrades, put on your armor, advance quickly,**

**Arrive at Wuhu Mountain, eliminate the enemy!**

**[Shaojianbo, soldiers, and the crowd say their goodbyes, Shaojianbo climbs high to command. Shaojianbo: Set out!**

**[The pursuit team and militia march forward quickly.**

**[Darkness falls.**

**[The snow is thick. The pursuit team members, two or three, rush through the heavy snow to explore the path.**

**[The pursuit team and militia, led by Li Yongqi, advance quickly in the sound of the "March of the Volunteers," breaking through the wind and snow, like a surging tide.**

**[Arriving at the cliff and steep wall, they take off their skis, climb up.**

**[Everyone bravely climbs to the top of the mountain. They cross the high mountains and steep cliffs, like countless soaring eagles, advancing confidently with great speed.**

**[Lights gradually dim, curtain falls]**

**Scene 10: The Hundred Chicken Banquet**

**[New Year's Eve night, Wuhu Hall on Wuhu Mountain. Small Bandit: He said he is Lan Ping, the deputy officer from Laotou Mountain. Seatshan Tao: Lan Ping? Bandit Jin: This guy came, he won't be spared! Seatshan Tao: Bring him up. Small Bandit: Bring the runaway up!**

**[Two small bandits escort Lan Ping onto the stage. Lan Ping: Third Uncle. Seatshan Tao: Deputy Officer Lan, why are you coming to see me? Lan Ping: Third Uncle, I am here to... to congratulate you on your birthday. Seatshan Tao: Hmph, you have the face to see me! Lan Ping: Third Uncle, I... Seatshan Tao: Shut up! Tell me, where did you come from? Lan Ping: I... I... Bandit Jin: Speak! Lan Ping: I... Bandit Jin: Speak up! Lan Ping: I will speak. I... from Commissioner Hou. Seatshan Tao: (coldly laughing) Hmph hmph! You came from Commissioner Hou. Call the Ninth Elder! Tadpole Nose: (to the small bandit) Call the Ninth Elder. Small Bandit: The Ninth Elder is here!**

**[Yang Zirong enters. Yang Zirong: (singing)**

**The Hundred Chicken Banquet is arranged, excitement is endless,**

**Just waiting to set fire to the mountain and annihilate the enemy.**

**Third Uncle, everything is arranged perfectly.**

**[The stage is silent. Seatshan Tao: Ninth Elder, look who has come. Yang Zirong: (seeing Lan Ping, startled, quickly calms down, decides to strike first) Oh! I was wondering who it was, it turns out to be Brother Lan, long time no see!**

**[Lan Ping is stunned. Yang Zirong: Brother Lan, I, Hu Biao, came first. How did you do? This time, joining Commissioner Hou, what rank did you get? I, Hu Biao, congratulate you on your promotion! Bandit Jin: (mocking) Yes, did you become a colonel? Ha ha ha!**

**[Lan Ping is at a loss. Seatshan Tao: Yes, what rank did Commissioner Hou give you? Why did you come to me? Lan Ping: (realizing, staring at Yang Zirong, smiling wickedly) Good one, Hu Biao! You... you are not... Yang Zirong: I am not? (authoritatively) Is it my fault, or yours? I, Hu Biao, am loyal and righteous! Not like you, Lan! Initially, I advised you to join Commander Chui, but you insisted on pulling me to join Commissioner Hou, this cannot be blamed on me not being righteous! — (pressing) Quickly answer Third Uncle's question, what rank did Commissioner Hou give you? Why did you come here today? What is your business? Lan Ping: (avoiding Yang Zirong) Third Uncle, I said... Yang Zirong: Don't beat around the bush! Today is Third Uncle's fiftieth birthday, there is no time to listen to your nonsense! Lan Ping: Third Uncle... Seatshan Tao: Less nonsense! Now I only ask you, what did you come for? Lan Ping: To join Third Uncle, change my allegiance. Yang Zirong: You were not going to join Commissioner Hou for a promotion? Lan Ping: (unable to answer) ...**

**[Silence for a moment. Seatshan Tao and the others glare at Lan Ping. Yang Zirong: Lan, Commissioner Hou sent you to do what? Speak the truth! Bandit Jin: Yes, what did you come for? Lan Ping: I did not come from Commissioner Hou! Big Pockmark: This guy just admitted it, now he denies it! He is not a good guy!**

**[The bandits laugh. Lan Ping: Stop laughing! You all have fallen into a trap! He is not Hu Biao, he is a Communist!**

**[Bandit Jin draws his weapon, aiming at Yang Zirong. Yang Zirong: (from tense to calm) Ha ha ha! Good! You say I am a Communist, then I am a Communist. Now, in front of Third Uncle and all the elders, you can talk about the background of this Communist. Seatshan Tao: Yes, you say he is not Hu Biao, he is a Communist, how did you know him? Lan Ping: (stammering) He... he... he... Yang Zirong: Third Uncle, today Lan's words are stammering, incoherent, I think he has something up his sleeve! Big Pockmark: Eight to nine chances he was captured by the Communists and released! Lan Ping: No, no! Yang Zirong: Was it the Communists who released you? Or did the Communists send you? Lan Ping: I... I... Tadpole Nose: Yes! Was it the Communists who sent you? Bandit Jin: Speak! Speak! Lan Ping: (stammering) ... Yang Zirong: Third Uncle, our Wuhu Mountain is well-defended, the Communists cannot break in. This guy coming in, there must be something fishy! Lan Ping: (defending) No, no! Yang Zirong: No matter what you say!**

**[Yang Zirong: (singing)**

**Inconstant, cunning and evil,**

**Stammering, definitely hiding treachery.**

**Leaving footprints at the mountain gate,**

**Wanting to lead the Communists up the mountain.**

**Company Commander—**

**[The company commander enters. Yang Zirong: (continuing)**

**Increase the guards, strictly guard the pass,**

**Without orders, do not return!**

**Seatshan Tao: Yes, without the Ninth Elder's order, do not withdraw the guards! Company Commander: Yes! (exits)**

**[Bandit Jin nods in approval. Seatshan Tao: (leaving his seat) You dog! Initially, you pulled the Ninth Elder to join Commissioner Hou, now you come to sow discord, still wanting to lead the Communists in, I will not tolerate you! Lan Ping: Third Uncle, he is not Hu Biao, he is really a Communist! (kneels down)**

**[The bandits despise Lan Ping. Yang Zirong: (seeing the opportunity) Lan, you are really vicious! You want to use Third Uncle's knife to kill me. I regret not killing you at Lizi Bay! Bandit Jin: Yes, yes! Yang Zirong: Third Uncle, I, Hu Biao, have never been bullied by a scoundrel. Today, for you, I have offended this mad dog, that's why he is so vicious! If you take me as a Communist, execute me immediately! — If you take me as Hu Biao, let me go down the mountain. Today, it's either him or me, not him living, not me living, keep him or keep me, Third Uncle, you decide! (takes off his badge, throws it to Seatshan Tao) The small bandits: Ninth Elder cannot go, Ninth Elder cannot go! Bandit Jin: Ninth Elder, cannot go! Seatshan Tao: (annoyed, hesitates for a long time, picks up the badge) Ninth Elder, why are you acting like a child, arguing with this mad dog? Third Uncle will not treat you unfairly. Come, put it on, put it on.**

**[Big Pockmark takes the badge from Seatshan Tao's hands and puts it on Yang Zirong. Lan Ping: (seeing the situation is unfavorable, pleads) Third Uncle... Seatshan Tao: (waves his sleeve) Hmph! (returns to his seat) Lan Ping: (throws himself at Yang Zirong's feet) Hu Biao, my younger brother! Yang Zirong: (ignores) ... Lan Ping: (slaps himself) I am not human, I am not human! Yang Zirong: (does not look at Lan Ping, shouts to the bandits) Time is up, it's time to congratulate Third Uncle!**

**[The small bandits shout "Oh oh." Big Pockmark: Third Uncle, your fiftieth birthday, this dog cannot ruin it. Tadpole Nose: If we don't kill this omen, it's not good for the mountain. The bandits: Yes, we must kill him! Lan Ping: Elders, Hu Biao, Third Uncle, spare my life!**

**[The hall is filled with a terrifying silence. Seatshan Tao: You dog! Today, if I don't kill you, it's disrespecting my fiftieth birthday, and it's disrespecting Hu Biao! Killing you, this omen, turning misfortune into good fortune; killing the owl, I will live a long life! Ha ha ha! Lan Ping: Third Uncle... spare my life! Tadpole Nose: Take him out! Yang Zirong: Leave him to me!**

**[Yang Zirong drags Lan Ping out of Wuhu Hall. Lan Ping collapses. Yang Zirong: (singing)**

**For decades, you have done evil,**

**Blood debts pile up, crimes are heavy.**

**Representing the country, executing you,**

**To avenge the people's grievances.**

**[Yang Zirong drags Lan Ping down. Gunshots. Yang Zirong returns. Yang Zirong: Third Uncle, everything is ready, now it's time to congratulate you. Seatshan Tao: Ninth Elder, you are the commander, you order. Yang Zirong: Brothers, light the hall, set fire to the mountain, congratulate Third Uncle!**

**[The company commander enters. Company Commander: Light the hall, set fire to the mountain, congratulate Third Uncle! Bandit Jin: Congratulate Third Uncle!**

**[The scene changes. The bandits congratulate Seatshan Tao. Yang Zirong: Brothers, today we have a master and disciple feast, eat and drink to our hearts' content, drink until we are drunk! The bandits: Yes, drink until we are drunk! Yang Zirong: Please, Third Uncle, take your seat. Seatshan Tao: Let the brothers go first. Yang Zirong: Today is your fiftieth birthday, you should go first. Seatshan Tao: (laughing wildly) Ha ha ha!**

**[The bandits enter the cave and take their seats. Yang Zirong: Company Commander, bring the guards back, let them drink a few cups. Company Commander: Yes! (exits)**

**[The bandits in the cave are drinking and gambling, in chaos.**

**[Yang Zirong looks around. Yang Zirong: (singing)**

**On New Year's Eve, the mountain is full of lights,**

**I have already set the signal fire all over the mountain.**

**According to the plan, the Hundred Chicken Banquet is arranged,**

**The bandits are drunk and in chaos.**

**Waiting, waiting for the comrades to appear immediately,**

**Destroying the bandit's den, annihilating the enemy is at hand.**

**Anxious, only feeling the time is too slow,**

**The comrades, however, are silent.**

**Unable to suppress my excitement, I go out to investigate—**

**[Turning to a faster rhythm]**

**In the emergency, I must be calm, I must control this secret passage.**

**[The scene changes. The bandits, drunk, stagger up. Seatshan Tao: Ninth Elder, why don't you come in to take your seat? You have worked hard for the mountain, everyone wants to toast you two cups. Yang Zirong: Today is your fiftieth birthday, you should be toasted. Quickly pour for Third Uncle.**

**[A small bandit pours the wine. Seatshan Tao: (drunk) Ninth Elder, I can't take it anymore. Yang Zirong: This wine is to add to your longevity, you can't not drink! Seatshan Tao: Good, good, good. So, I will drink one cup. Yang Zirong: Then let the Chief of Staff accompany you with three cups. Big Pockmark: Alright.**

**[They all drink the wine.**

**[Machine gun fire. They throw their wine cups. Bandit Jin is injured and enters. Bandit Jin: The Communists' machine guns have sealed off Wuhu Hall!**

**[The Liberation Army shouts inside: "Surrender, don't be killed!" Seatshan Tao: Ninth Elder, quickly, let's go through this secret passage!**

**[Seatshan Tao lifts the chair, Yang Zirong pushes him aside. Yang Zirong: Don't move!**

**[Several Liberation Army soldiers rush in, shouting: "Surrender, don't be killed!" Seatshan Tao: Ah! You are... Yang Zirong: I am the People's Liberation Army! Seatshan Tao: Ah!**

**[Seatshan Tao tries to draw his gun, but it is struck down by Yang Zirong. Seatshan Tao escapes down. The bandits escape into the cave. Yang Zirong: Comrades! This is the secret passage. Rescue the villagers, capture Seatshan Tao alive! (chases down)**

**[The Liberation Army soldiers chase down.**

**[Sun Dade fights with a bandit, killing him. Big Pockmark enters, is injured by Sun Dade, and escapes down; Sun Dade chases down.**

**[Lan Chaojia chases a bandit, fights; Chang Bao chases a bandit, fights, and captures the bandit. Lan Chaojia and Chang Bao escort the bandit down.**

**[Li Yongqi, Bai Ru, soldiers, and militia rescue the villagers who were kidnapped up the mountain, and exit.**

**[The company commander escapes up, is killed by Li Yongqi.**

**[Seatshan Tao escapes up, two small bandits follow; Yang Zirong chases up, kills the two small bandits; Yang Zirong fights with Seatshan Tao.**

**[Dong Zhongsong, soldiers, chase Tadpole Nose and the bandits up, fight.**

**[Yang Zirong seizes the gun, kills several bandits.**
