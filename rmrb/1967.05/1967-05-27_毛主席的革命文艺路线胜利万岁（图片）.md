To commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's speech "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must ensure that literature and art become an integral part of the revolutionary machine. They should serve as powerful weapons to unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, and annihilate the enemy. They should help the people unite and fight against the enemy with one heart and one mind.
