	Lao Patriotic Military and Civilians Kill Over 200 Enemy in April

	According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station on the 13th: In April, the patriotic military and civilians of central and southern Laos bravely counterattacked the invading and "sweeping" actions of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, killing over 200 enemy soldiers, destroying two military vehicles, and shooting down one enemy aircraft.

	Cambodia Resolutely Opposes U.S. Economic Aggression

	The Cambodian government recently reiterated its opposition to the U.S. imperialists' plot of aggression in the so-called "Mekong Committee," and is prepared to raise funds to build the Tonle Sap River dam project. This firm stance has dealt another blow to the U.S. imperialists' "aid" scam.

	In April, the U.S. imperialists manipulated their puppets in South Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos to hold a meeting of the "Mekong Committee" in Tokyo, attempting to use "economic aid" as a cover to carry out U.S. aggression, control, and infiltration of the Mekong River basin countries. The Cambodian government flatly refused to participate in this meeting.

	American Youth Bravely Launch Anti-War Struggle

	From May 9th to 12th, more than 20 American youths protested for four days and nights in front of the U.S. Department of Defense, and twice stormed into the heavily guarded Pentagon, protesting against the U.S. government's war of aggression in Vietnam.

	The U.S. authorities sent out a large number of thugs to forcibly drag them out. However, they were fearless and continued to charge towards the Pentagon. When the police arrested them, they shouted to the crowd: "Don't work for the Pentagon! Don't work for the government! Don't pay taxes! Join our anti-war movement!"

	Yemen President Orders Trial of Two American Criminals

	On the 13th, Yemeni President Abdullah al-Sallal ordered the handover of two American criminals to the Supreme State Security Court for trial. The order stated that the actions of these two Americans harmed Yemen's independence and territorial integrity.

	These two Americans were officials of the U.S. "Fourth Point Plan" office in Yemen. On April 25th, they attacked the Yemeni military arsenal in Taiz with a rocket launcher and were arrested by the Yemeni government.

	Lebanese People in the South Hold Anti-U.S. Demonstrations

	Recently, people in southern Lebanon held demonstrations and marches to protest against the visit of the U.S. Sixth Fleet and the U.S. ambassador to the southern Lebanese port of Sour.

	The Lebanese authorities, in order to facilitate the U.S. ambassador's visit to the southern cities, dispatched a large number of security forces in the cities of Sidon and Sour and along the roads, with strict security measures. Police cars patrolled the roads, and security forces searched vehicles passing by.

	The UAR's Al-Ahram newspaper reported on the 13th that the UAR government rejected the U.S. government's formal request for the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean to visit UAR ports.

	The newspaper stated that the UAR side noted Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol's remarks that "Israel's security guarantee depends on the presence of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean"; in response, the UAR side clearly pointed out: "The Sixth Fleet, which has such a relationship with Israel or is at least viewed in this way by Israel, visiting any UAR port is inappropriate."

	Peruvian Public Opposes U.S. Recruitment of Cannon Fodder

	Recently, people from all walks of life in Peru strongly opposed the U.S. government's plan to send Peruvian citizens residing in the U.S. to South Vietnam to be cannon fodder.
