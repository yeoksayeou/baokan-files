Vice Premier Chen Yi, on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai, received the ambassadors and representatives from Arab countries this evening. He expressed resolute support for the struggle of the Arab countries and people against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

The ambassadors and representatives from six Arab countries and the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Beijing office introduced the current situation of the Arab countries and people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

Ambassador Imam, on behalf of the Arab countries' envoys and Mr. Jabir, expressed gratitude to the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese leadership, and the Chinese people for their most resolute, powerful, and friendly support for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab countries.

Ambassador Imam said that Israel's aggression against the Arab countries has provoked resistance. The peoples of the Arab countries resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel. The peoples of the Arab countries have been mobilized and are determined to defeat the aggressors. He said that the Arab countries are confident that their just struggle will definitely receive the most resolute support from the Chinese people. At the same time, it will certainly receive the support of the people of the whole world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said he would convey the determination expressed by the Arab countries' envoys and Mr. Jabir to oppose the U.S. and Israel to the leaders of the Chinese Party and government. Vice Premier Chen Yi also expressed gratitude for the trust of the Arab countries and people.

He said that the struggle of the Arab countries and people against U.S. and British imperialism and Israel is a life-and-death struggle, which cannot be compromised.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the current international situation is very good and completely favorable for the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people. Recently, the Vietnamese people have won a great victory, and U.S. imperialism has suffered a big defeat, which is a powerful support for the struggle of the Arab countries. He said that the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab countries and people is just. The Arab countries have a population of 100 million. If you unite and persist in the struggle, do not be deceived by some hypocrites, and fight on for a long time, you will definitely achieve victory. The imperialist camp led by U.S. imperialism is disintegrating. They are most afraid that you will unite and persist in the anti-imperialist struggle.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Chinese government and people will support your struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, just as we supported Egypt during the Suez Canal War in 1956, until you achieve victory.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, you don't need to thank us. Your anti-imperialist victory is our victory. The Chinese people supporting you is our internationalist duty.

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 27th, Ambassador Imam of the United Arab Republic called on Vice Premier Chen Yi, also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and conveyed the respect and gratitude of President Nasser, the government and people of the United Arab Republic, and the Arab people to Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people for their firm support for the struggle of the United Arab Republic and Arab countries against U.S. imperialism and Zionism.

Ambassador Imam also introduced the current situation of the Arab countries' struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, expressed thanks for Ambassador Imam's remarks and immediately declared: The Chinese people will forever be the loyal and reliable anti-imperialist comrades of the Arab people. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought resolutely stand on the side of the Arab people and firmly support all their just struggles.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that the struggle of the Arab people against U.S. imperialism and Zionism is an important part of the world anti-imperialist struggle. This struggle has powerfully struck at imperialism and old and new colonialism and supported the anti-imperialist cause of the people of all countries in the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that as long as the Arab people unite and persist in the struggle, they will definitely achieve victory. The current international situation is very favorable for the Arab countries. You must persist in the struggle. At present, you must be especially vigilant against the conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist leadership to fake support and actually betray.

    在会见阿联大使时重申中国人民永远是阿拉伯人民的反帝战友
    新华社二十七日讯  陈毅副总理兼外交部长代表周恩来总理，今晚同时接见了阿联驻华大使伊马姆，阿尔及利亚驻华大使萨赫利，叙利亚驻华大使萨迪克，伊拉克驻华大使拉希德，也门驻华大使哈米德，摩洛哥驻华大使馆临时代办阿洛伊，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布，对阿拉伯国家和人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争，表示坚决的支持。
    阿拉伯国家的六位使节和加尔布先生，在同陈毅副总理兼外交部长进行的亲切友好的谈话中，介绍了目前阿拉伯国家和人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争形势。
    伊马姆大使代表阿拉伯国家的使节和加尔布先生感谢中国政府、中国共产党、中国领导人、中国人民给了阿拉伯国家的反帝斗争以最坚决最有力最友好的支持。
    伊马姆大使说，以色列对阿拉伯国家进行了侵略，激起了阿拉伯国家的反抗。阿拉伯各国人民坚决反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列。阿拉伯各国人民已经动员起来，决心打败侵略者。他说，阿拉伯国家坚信，他们的正义斗争一定能得到中国人民最坚决的支持。同时，也必然会得到全世界人民的支持。
    陈毅副总理兼外交部长表示将把阿拉伯国家使节和加尔布先生所表达的反对美帝和以色列的决心转达中国党和政府领导人。陈毅副总理兼外交部长并表示感谢阿拉伯国家和人民对中国的信任。
    他说，阿拉伯国家和人民反对美、英帝国主义和以色列的斗争是一场你死我活的斗争，这是不能够妥协的。
    陈毅副总理说，目前的国际形势非常好，完全有利于阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争。最近，越南人民打了大胜仗，美帝国主义吃了大败仗，这是对阿拉伯国家的斗争的有力支援。他说，阿拉伯国家和人民的反帝斗争是正义的。阿拉伯国家有一亿人口，你们团结起来，坚持斗争，不要受某些伪善者的欺骗，长期斗争下去，就一定会取得胜利。以美帝为首的帝国主义阵营支离破碎，他们最怕你们团结起来，坚持反帝斗争。
    陈毅副总理说，中国政府和中国人民将象一九五六年苏伊士运河战争时期支持埃及那样，来支持你们反对美帝及其侵略工具以色列的斗争，直到你们取得胜利。
    陈毅副总理说，你们不用感谢我们，你们反帝的胜利就是我们的胜利。中国人民支援你们，是我们应尽的国际主义义务。
    据新华社二十七日讯  阿拉伯联合共和国驻华大使伊马姆今天下午拜会陈毅副总理兼外交部长，向他转达了纳赛尔总统、阿联政府、阿联人民和阿拉伯人民对毛主席、林副主席、中国政府和中国人民的敬意，感谢中国坚决支持阿联和阿拉伯国家反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争。
    伊马姆大使还向陈毅副总理兼外长介绍了目前阿拉伯国家反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争形势。
    陈毅副总理兼外长对伊马姆大使的谈话表示感谢，并立即声明：中国人民永远是阿拉伯人民忠实可靠的反帝战友。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，坚决支持他们的一切正义斗争。
    陈毅副总理兼外长说，阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争，是世界反帝斗争的一个重要组成部分。这个斗争有力地打击了帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支援了世界各国人民的反帝斗争事业。
    陈毅副总理兼外长还说，阿拉伯人民只要团结一致，坚持斗争，就一定能够取得胜利。目前的国际形势对阿拉伯国家很有利，一定要坚持斗争下去。当前，要特别警惕苏联修正主义领导集团假支持真出卖的阴谋。
