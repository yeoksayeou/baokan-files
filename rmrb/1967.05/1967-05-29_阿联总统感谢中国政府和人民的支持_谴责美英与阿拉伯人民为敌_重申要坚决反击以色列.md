	Egyptian President Thanks Chinese Government and People for Their Support
	Condemns U.S. and Britain as Enemies of the Arab People, Reiterates Determination to Resist Israel

	CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad met with Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Huang Hua on May 27, conveying President Gamal Abdel Nasser's gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai for the support of the Chinese government and people in the struggle of the Egyptian government and people against imperialism and Zionism.

	Riad said, "We are confident that China will support us without hesitation in our struggle against imperialism and Zionism."

	During the meeting, Foreign Minister Riad and Ambassador Huang had a friendly discussion on the current situation in the Middle East.

	CAIRO, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser strongly condemned the United States as "the chief defender of Israel" and "an enemy of the Arabs" on May 26.

	In a speech to the Arab Trade Union International Federation delegation, Nasser said, "It is clear that the United States is an enemy of the Arabs because it stands completely on the side of Israel. Britain is also an enemy of the Arabs because it completely supports Israel. We should treat our enemies and those who stand with them accordingly." Therefore, the battle between the Arabs and Israel is not just between them.

	Nasser refuted the U.S. claim that Egypt's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba threatens peace. He said, "When Israel threatened Syria, the United States and Britain remained silent. No one talked about peace, and no one talked about peace being threatened. This once again shows that the United States and Britain are friends of Israel and enemies of the Arabs."

	Nasser emphasized Egypt's sovereignty over the Gulf of Aqaba and the blockade of Israeli shipping in the Gulf. He said, "We will never give up our rights in the Gulf of Aqaba."

	He said that Egypt's takeover of Sharm el-Sheikh (a strategic point on the route from the Gulf of Aqaba to the Red Sea) is a direct confrontation with Israel. Therefore, taking this step means we must be prepared for a full-scale war with Israel. He also said that the Arab people are determined to restore the rights of the Palestinian people, and this goal must be achieved. Finally, Nasser hailed the unity of the Arab people.

    阿联总统感谢中国政府和人民的支持
    谴责美英与阿拉伯人民为敌　重申要坚决反击以色列
    新华社开罗二十七日电　阿联外交部长里亚德二十七日会见中国驻阿联大使黄华，转达了阿联总统纳赛尔对周恩来总理的谢意，感谢中国政府和人民支持阿联政府和人民反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争。
    里亚德说，我们确信，中国一定会在我们的反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争中，毫不犹疑地支持我们。
    在会见时，里亚德外交部长和黄华大使就当前中东地区的局势进行了友好的谈话。
    新华社开罗二十七日电　阿联总统纳赛尔二十六日强烈谴责美国“是以色列的头号辩护士”，“是阿拉伯的敌人”。
    纳赛尔在对阿拉伯工会国际联合会代表团发表讲话时说：“很清楚，美国就是阿拉伯的敌人，因为它完全站在以色列一边。英国也是阿拉伯的敌人，因为它完全偏袒以色列。我们应该根据这点来对待我们的敌人和那些同他们站在一边的人。”因此，阿拉伯人同以色列之间的战斗不仅仅是他们之间的战斗。
    纳赛尔驳斥美国说阿联封锁亚喀巴湾威胁了和平的谬论。他说，当以色列威胁叙利亚的时候，美国和英国都保持沉默，没有人谈论和平，也没有人谈论和平受到威胁。这再一次表明，美国和英国是以色列的朋友，是阿拉伯的敌人。
    纳赛尔强调阿联对亚喀巴湾的主权和对以色列在亚喀巴湾的航运实行封锁。他说：“我们决不放弃我们在亚喀巴湾的权利。”
    他说，阿联接管沙姆沙伊赫（位于亚喀巴湾通往红海必经之地）就是同以色列的实际对抗。因此，我们采取这一步骤，就得准备同以色列进行全面战争。他还说，阿拉伯人决心恢复巴勒斯坦人民的权利，这一目的必须实现。最后，纳赛尔欢呼阿拉伯人民之间的团结。
