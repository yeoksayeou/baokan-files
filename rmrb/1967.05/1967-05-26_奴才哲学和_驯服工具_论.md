Today, our newspaper published several articles by readers, criticizing the reactionary film "The Story of Wu Xun" that advocates slavery.

"The Story of Wu Xun" was released in 1950. This film, which was enthusiastically praised by a group of representatives of the bourgeoisie inside and outside the Party, praises what kind of person? Promotes what kind of ideology? Meets the needs of which class? Reflects the demands of which class?

"The Story of Wu Xun" praises Wu Xun, a loyal servant of the feudal ruling class. The film, with the most frenzied passion and the most obsequious language, drapes this clown, who kneels at the feet of the reactionary ruling class, in the colorful robes of "serving the people," hails him as a "saint" soaring into the heavens, and praises him as a "hero" who "devotes himself to the end." It fervently advocates slavery, capitulationism, and bourgeois reformism.

At a time when land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were in full swing after the founding of New China, this film, standing on the side of the landlord bourgeoisie, enthusiastically praised and sang the praises of the reactionary class and its servants, viciously slandered and opposed the revolutionary mass movements. This was a wanton attack on the young dictatorship of the proletariat, a summoning of the spirits for the dying reactionary class.

In 1951, under the personal initiation and leadership of Chairman Mao, a criticism of "The Story of Wu Xun" was launched. This was a major struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party on the ideological and cultural front after the liberation of our country.

Today, as Chairman Mao's "We Must Pay Attention to the Discussion of the Film 'The Story of Wu Xun'" is reprinted, we must once again criticize this reactionary film. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further criticize the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their ultimate backer—the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party—who support and praise this reactionary film, thoroughly criticize the philosophy of servitude, capitulationism, and treachery that they fervently advocate, and enthusiastically sing the praises of the new class forces, new people, and new ideas of the era of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Let us strive to create the most brilliant and radiant proletarian new culture in human history!

The Philosophy of Servitude and the "Tame Tool" Theory
Yao Weidou

Lenin said: "A slave who delights in praising the beautiful life of slavery and is grateful to the kind and benevolent master is a servile flatterer, a scoundrel."

Wu Xun is precisely such a servile flatterer and scoundrel. His nickname "Doumi" (meaning bean dregs) aptly reveals the essence of this social dreg. Wu Xun embodies all the most typical characteristics of a servile flatterer. He is "unassertive," "respectful to everyone," and his philosophy of life is to accept money and live. He does nothing but kneel before the feudal rulers.

Wu Xun is a "speaking tool" of the feudal class. He sings with relish:

"Without plows, without harnesses, without earthen mats to smooth the path," fully believing himself to be a "human beast of burden." While crawling on the ground "seriously," he sings shamelessly: "I am the horse, you ride me, ... ride steadily, crawl quickly, I am happy, you are at ease." This shows how tame this servile flatterer is!

It must be pointed out that behind the face of such a servile flatterer as Wu Xun, there lurks a filthy soul that seeks to "suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage." He can eat bricks and tiles, can crawl around, but his ultimate goal is to climb to the position of the ruling class and obtain tenfold, hundredfold "rewards." Wu Xun is precisely such a "leading sheep" raised by the feudal class, wearing the badge of "Director of the School of Virtue," deceiving and misleading the people. Therefore, the ruling class hopes that "in this world, there should be a few hundred, a few thousand such servile flatterers as Wu Xun."

The film "The Story of Wu Xun" and its promoters portray Wu Xun's servile appearance as "humble and willing to be a cow for the people," "wholeheartedly serving the people," and even as the "spirit of Lu Xun." This is a complete inversion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white!

Chairman Mao said, "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest, he has not the slightest trace of servility and flattery." Lu Xun is a true revolutionary. It was Lu Xun who severely denounced Wu Xun and his ilk as "slaves doomed to eternal damnation." He exposed the conspiracy of the reactionaries to promote the servile flatterer Wu Xun: "If one finds 'beauty' in slave life, praises it, caresses it, and is intoxicated by it, then one is simply a slave doomed to eternal damnation, making oneself and others forever content with this life." The promoters of Wu Xun dare to use the so-called "spirit of Wu Xun" to defame Lu Xun, which is intolerable!

When it comes to the "spirit of Wu Xun," someone has inherited it. This person is China's Khrushchev. He is the opportunist who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks for a lifetime of wealth and privilege, who "suffers a small loss to gain a big advantage" and is a counter-revolutionary double-dealer. In the infamous "Cultivation of the Self," he vigorously advocated "enduring humiliation," "yielding to pressure," "tolerance," "compromise," and "repaying evil with kindness," promoting the absolute obedience of the revisionist black "discipline." This China's Khrushchev later even proposed the "tame tool" theory, wanting others to be his "tame," "easily controllable" tools. He said: "Should one be a tame tool or an uncontrollable tool? Of course, one should be a tame tool, an easily controllable tool," to be "very convenient and handy to use."

The intentions of Cáo Zào are clear to all. China's Khrushchev brings over this tattered "theory" of the exploiting class, with the sole purpose of preparing the ideological and organizational conditions for his restoration of the capitalist system!

### 奴才哲学和“驯服工具”论

专栏：

    今天本报发表了几篇读者的文章，对宣扬奴隶主义的反动影片《武训传》展开了批判。
    《武训传》是一九五○年出笼的。这部受到一批党内外资产阶级代表人物狂热吹捧的影片，究竟歌颂什么人物？宣扬什么思想？适应哪个阶级的需要？反映哪个阶级的要求？
    《武训传》歌颂的是一个封建统治阶级的忠实奴才武训。影片以最疯狂的热情，最肉麻的语言，给这个拜倒在反动统治阶级脚下的小丑，披上“为人民服务”的斑斓的衣衫，把他吹捧为高入云端的“圣人”，吹捧为“鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已”的“英雄”，借以狂热地宣扬奴隶主义，宣扬投降主义，宣扬资产阶级改良主义。
    正当新中国刚刚成立，土地改革和镇压反革命运动轰轰烈烈展开的时候，这个影片站在地主资产阶级的立场上，卖力地称赞和歌颂反动阶级及其奴才，恶毒地诬蔑和反对革命群众运动。这是对年轻的无产阶级专政的猖狂进攻，是为垂死的反动阶级招魂。
    一九五一年，在毛主席的亲自发动和领导下，对《武训传》展开了批判。这是我国解放以后，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级反动路线在思想文化战线上的一次重大斗争。
    今天，正当毛主席的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》重新发表的时候，再次批判这部反动影片，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进一步批判支持和吹捧这部反动影片的一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判他们狂热宣扬的奴才哲学、投降哲学和叛徒哲学，满腔热情地歌颂无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政时代的新的阶级力量，新的人物和新的思想，努力创造人类历史上最光辉灿烂的无产阶级新文化！　					——编者		
    奴才哲学和“驯服工具”论
    姚维斗
    列宁说：“津津乐道地赞赏美妙的奴隶生活并对和善的好心的主人感激不尽的奴隶是奴才，是无耻之徒。”
    武训正是那种奴颜婢膝的十足的奴才和无耻之徒。他的外号“豆沫”（豆渣之意），恰好道出了这个社会渣滓的本质。武训身上具有奴才的一切最典型的东西。为人“没火性”，见人“把礼敬”，赏钱、活命就是他的人生哲学。他对封建统治者除了下跪，还是下跪。
    武训是封建阶级“会说话的工具”。他津津有味地唱道：
  “不用格拉，不用套，不用干土垫磨道”，完全是自认为“人形牲口”的奴才。他一面在地上“认真地爬来爬去”，一面无耻地唱：“我做马，让你骑，……骑得稳，爬得快，俺高兴，你自在”。可见这个奴才驯顺到何等地步！
    必须指出，在武训这种奴才面孔的后面，正隐藏着“吃小亏，占大便宜”的肮脏灵魂。他可以吃砖头瓦片，可以爬来爬去，但最终目的却是爬上统治阶级的地位，得到十倍、百倍的“赏赐”。武训正是这样成为封建阶级豢养的一只“带头羊”，挂上了“义学正”的奖牌，麻醉、欺骗人民群众。因此，统治阶级希望“这世上还得有几百个、几千个，象武训这样的奴才”。
    影片《武训传》和武训的吹捧者，把武训这副奴才相，说成是“俯首甘为孺子牛”、“全心全意为人民服务的精神”，甚至说成是“鲁迅精神”。真是颠倒是非、混淆黑白！
    毛主席说，“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的，他没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨”。鲁迅是真正的革命家。正是鲁迅，严词痛斥武训之流是“万劫不复的奴才。”一针见血地揭露了反动派吹捧奴才武训的阴谋：“如果从奴隶生活中寻出‘美’来，赞叹，抚摩，陶醉，那可简直是万劫不复的奴才了，他使自己和别人永远安住于这生活。”武训的鼓吹者，竟敢用所谓“武训精神”来污蔑鲁迅，是可忍，孰不可忍！
    谈到“武训精神”，是有人继承的。这个人就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。他就是为了“一生富贵”而混入革命队伍的投机分子，为了“占个大便宜”而“吃点小亏”的反革命两面派。在臭名昭彰的《修养》中，他竭力宣扬“忍辱负重”、“委曲求全”、“容忍”、“妥协”、“以德报怨”，提倡绝对服从的修正主义黑“纪律”。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，后来更提出了“驯服工具”论，要别人当他的“驯服的”、“容易驾驭的”工具。他说：“是作驯服的工具，还是作不容易驾驭的工具呢？当然要作驯服的工具，要作容易驾驭的工具”，要“使用起来非常灵便，得心应手”。
    司马昭之心，路人皆知。中国的赫鲁晓夫把剥削阶级这个破烂“理论”搬来，其目的不过是为他复辟资本主义制度准备思想上和组织上的条件！
