Workers of all countries are celebrating May Day, International Labor Day, amidst their struggles.

In Bamako, the capital of Mali, workers held a rally and parade on May 1 to celebrate International Labor Day. President Modibo Keita, in his speech at the rally, spoke about the achievements of Mali in economic construction. He called on Malian workers to overcome all current difficulties and develop the national economy.

Famadi Sissoko, Secretary-General of the National Union of Workers of Mali, condemned in his speech the crimes of American imperialism in its aggression against Vietnam and its mass slaughter and suppression of the people of colonial countries.

The Malian workers participating in the parade held up placards with slogans such as:
“Down with imperialism, down with colonialism, down with neo-colonialism!”
“Imperialism, get out of Vietnam!”

On May 1, the Secretary-General of the Somali General Union of Workers, Aden Mohammed Ali, announced at a rally in Mogadishu to celebrate International Labor Day: “The Somali General Union of Workers wholeheartedly supports the just struggle of the Vietnamese workers and all the Vietnamese people to resist American aggression and save their country, and wishes them a complete victory over American imperialism.” He also condemned the atrocities of colonialists on the Somali coast, Mozambique, Angola, and occupied South Arabia. He announced his support for the struggle of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland.

On May 1, various sectors of the people in Aden held a general strike, shutdown, and school boycott to protest the British colonial authorities' massacre of Arabs. This was the fifth large-scale anti-imperialist movement in the “Aden Colony” this year.

Reports said that on this day, all shops in Aden were closed, transportation was disrupted, schools were suspended, and Aden Airport and port were completely paralyzed.

Spanish workers and students, despite police brutality, held demonstrations in major industrial cities of Spain on May Day, International Labor Day, to oppose the fascist rule of Franco and demand democratic rights.

In the northern industrial city of San Sebastian, more than 4,000 workers and students participated in the May Day demonstration. The demonstrators clashed violently with the police.

More than 6,000 citizens in Oslo held a demonstration on May 1 to protest against the aggression of American imperialism in Vietnam.

This was the largest anti-American demonstration in the Norwegian capital. Angry crowds marched and demonstrated on the main streets of Oslo and then went to protest in front of the U.S. Embassy. They carried placards against American imperialism with slogans such as: “U.S. out of Vietnam!” “Vietnam belongs to the Vietnamese people!” “Stop bombing (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam)!” “Stop American imperialism (aggression)!”

After the march and demonstration, they held a mass rally. At the meeting, speakers unanimously condemned U.S. aggression against the Vietnamese people. The delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, invited to participate in the May Day demonstration in Oslo, also attended the rally.

On the evening of May Day, Australian students held a demonstration outside the residence of Prime Minister Holt to protest against the expansion of the U.S. war in Vietnam.

When Holt returned to his residence, the demonstration reached its peak. The demonstrators accused him of following U.S. orders and implementing a policy of dragging Australia into the Vietnam War. Holt hid inside the house and did not dare to come out.

The demonstrators angrily shouted slogans such as: “Bring back the Australian troops!” “Don’t follow the Americans!”
