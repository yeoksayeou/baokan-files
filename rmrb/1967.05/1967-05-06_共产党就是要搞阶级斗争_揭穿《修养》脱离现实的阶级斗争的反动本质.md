Chairman Mao has taught us: "Why do we need a revolutionary party? Because there are enemies in the world who oppress the people. The people want to overthrow the oppression of the enemy, so we need a revolutionary party." Our Communist Party does not do anything else; it is all about class struggle, about seizing power from the reactionary ruling class, and about establishing proletarian dictatorship. This is the most fundamental and core issue of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. If we do not engage in class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, the Communist Party can be abolished.

Class struggle is an objective existence that is not subject to the will of individuals. Since the existence of classes in human society, from ancient times to the present, in all realms of society, the most basic issue, the issue that influences everything, is class struggle. "Class struggle, some classes win, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization over thousands of years." Under socialist conditions, has class struggle been "extinguished" as the number one capitalist-roader in the party says? No, absolutely not. Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out to us: Throughout the transitional period, there are class contradictions, there is class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Forgetting the basic theory and practice of our party over the past decade or so will lead us astray. Whether or not to engage in class struggle is a question of whether or not to uphold proletarian dictatorship and whether or not to uphold the socialist road. _Cultivation_ is a book that specifically talks about the "cultivation" of Communist Party members, but it detaches itself from the reality of class struggle, does not talk about seizing power, does not talk about proletarian dictatorship, and only talks about bourgeois individual "cultivation." This is the reactionary essence of _Cultivation_, the crux of the matter. If we follow what _Cultivation_ says, then Communist Party members will "cultivate" themselves into bourgeois elements riding on the heads of the laboring people, and the Marxist party will become a revisionist party, a fascist party. Comrades, think about it, how dangerous this is!

On the fundamental questions of whether or not to actively engage in the class struggle in real society, whether or not to carry out class struggle within the party, and whether or not to carry out class struggle within one's own mind, _Cultivation_ is completely opposed to Mao Zedong Thought.

	Should We Actively Engage in the Class Struggle in Real Society?

Chairman Mao has taught us: "Our Communist Party members should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the storm of mass struggle, and this world is the world of mass struggle." Chairman Mao also said: "If our party members spend their entire lives sitting in a room and not going out, not experiencing storms, not seeing the world, what good will this party member do for the Chinese people? It will do no good at all. We do not need such people as party members." However, the author of _Cultivation_ wants our Communist Party members to "cultivate" themselves behind closed doors, learning how Confucius reached "at seventy, follow the heart's desire without transgressing the rules," how Mencius "labored his sinews and starved his body," and how Zengzi "examined myself three times a day." As for the "storm of mass struggle" and the "world of mass struggle," all of this is absent here! This is not talking about the cultivation of Communist Party members at all, but rather about the cultivation of a hermit in the mountains!

Flipping through the 48,000-word _Cultivation_, you won't find a single word discussing the class struggle in real society. Here, it is a paradise-like "state of no difference." Even the language used is "transcendent of class," such as "self-respect," "self-love," "human righteousness," "true human sympathizer," "die for righteousness," "sacrifice for righteousness," and so on. It uses a large amount of political terminology and moral concepts from the landlord and bourgeoisie to openly oppose Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of class struggle.

Is this an accidental oversight? Absolutely not! China's Khrushchev, like the Soviet Union's Khrushchev, is a propagandist of the theory of the extinction of class struggle. Ten years ago, he advocated that "class struggle in China has basically ended," "the landlord class has been eliminated, and the bourgeoisie has basically been eliminated," "the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved." In 1965, the great Four Clean-ups movement had already been widely launched across the vast land of our country, and the movement had already uncovered a large number of shocking facts of class struggle. However, China's Khrushchev still denied the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the contradiction between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: The Four Clean-ups movement is to resolve the contradiction between socialism and capitalism. But he absurdly said that the nature of the Four Clean-ups movement is the contradiction between the Four Clean-ups and the Four Unclean, the intersection of contradictions within and outside the party, or the intersection of enemy and people's internal contradictions.

In the eyes of the authors of _Cultivation_, the reason Communist Party members need to be tempered and cultivated is simply because each party member often comes into contact with "all the bad things in society." What a "bad thing"! The Soviet Union's Khrushchev still had to mention that the Soviet Union "still has capitalist remnants obstructing social progress," but China's Khrushchev is even more thorough in his "cultivation," erasing even the four characters "capitalism"!

This is a complete political lie!

Has class struggle ever stopped for a single year, month, or day? Let's look at the facts from the few years when this poisonous weed _Cultivation_ was concentrated and marketed!

In 1939, when _Cultivation_ was first published, the iron hoofs of Japanese imperialism trampled over vast territories of our country, and the people of the entire nation were suffering in deep water and fire. Tens of thousands of outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation were fighting bravely on the front lines of the anti-Japanese war, while the Kuomintang reactionaries were passively resisting Japan and actively opposing the Communists, and plotting to surrender to the enemy. How sharp and intense the class struggle was!

In 1949, when _Cultivation_ was again widely published, the great people's liberation war was about to achieve complete victory across the nation. The American imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, unwilling to accept their defeat, launched a frenzied counterattack militarily and politically. Our great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to carry the revolution through to the end. After entering the cities, we again faced sharp and complex struggles with the bourgeoisie. How sharp and intense the class struggle was!

In 1962, when _Cultivation_ was carefully dressed up and published again, the class struggle at home and abroad was even more sharp, complex, and intense. The American imperialists, the Khrushchev revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries were frantically singing an anti-China chorus. At home, the ghosts and snakes and a small group of right-opportunist elements who had been demoted all came out, launching a frenzied attack on the party and socialism. The "heroes" in the "Three Families Village" and "Four Stores" were even more murderous, shouting: "Do not say that scholars are empty talkers, the head thrown here is bloodstained!" The Kuomintang bandits, at the instigation of American imperialism, were also shouting at the top of their lungs that the "time is ripe" to invade the mainland. How sharp and intense the class struggle was!

However, at these several critical historical moments, _Cultivation_, which was published and reprinted, did not call on Communist Party members to rush to the anti-Japanese front to fight bravely, did not remind Communist Party members that they must carry the revolution through to the end, and did not require Communist Party members to fight bravely in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and the fierce attacks of domestic class enemies. All these struggles related to the life and death of the state and nation did not enter the eyes of the authors of _Cultivation_. In their view, the highest task of Communist Party members is to "cultivate" themselves behind closed doors. Cultivate, cultivate, and when the "merit is complete," the Heavenly Father will "bestow a great mission upon this person"!

Comrades! This number one capitalist-roader in the party, has he really become a hermit-like figure in the mountains? No, he is not so foolish. He calls on others to forget class struggle, and in itself, this is a form of class struggle. He himself has been engaged in bourgeois class struggle, scheming to stage a coup, and engaging in conspiracy activities to usurp the party, the government, and the military. The historical experience of proletarian dictatorship reminds us that after the proletariat seizes power, no matter how many things there are, they must never forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. Forgetting class struggle and proletarian dictatorship is forgetting politics, forgetting the fundamentals of Marxism, and that is being foolish. It will make one comfortably become a revisionist.

	Should We Carry Out Class Struggle Within the Party?

The history of the Communist Party of China has always been permeated with the struggle between the two lines. Chairman Mao has taught us: "Different thoughts and struggles within the party are constantly occurring. This is the reflection of class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things in society within the party. If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the party, the life of the party will also stop." However, the author of _Cultivation_ openly opposes our beloved leader Chairman Mao. Under the guise of opposing "stirring up trouble out of nothing," he slanders the struggle within the party and vigorously advocates "peace within the party," brazenly stripping the party struggle of its class content, saying: "Because the methods of handling problems are different due to the different ways of looking at problems among various party members, it leads to many different opinions, different propositions, and disputes within the party, leading to struggles within the party."

Denying the class content of the struggle within the party is also denying the struggle within the party. Is the number one capitalist-roader in the party not engaged in the struggle within the party? No! He is an old hand at the struggle within the party, but he is not engaged in the struggle within the party from the standpoint of the proletariat, but from the reactionary standpoint of the bourgeoisie. He deliberately obscures the class content of the struggle within the party for his own ulterior motives.

Firstly, he wants to peddle his slavish ideology to the broad masses of party members under the banner of "peace within the party." Chairman Mao has taught us: "Communist Party members should question everything, think it over carefully in their own minds, and see if it conforms to reality and if it is reasonable. They must not blindly follow and must not advocate slavishness." However, this number one capitalist-roader in the party uses the spiritual shackles of slavishness to bind the broad masses of party members, not allowing them to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. He repeatedly emphasizes blind obedience, "All conditional obedience is wrong. It should be unconditional and absolute obedience," "As long as it is the majority, or the upper level or the central committee has passed and decided, it should be obeyed, even if it is wrong, it should be obeyed."

This Chinese Khrushchev is so eager to peddle slavishness, turning you into his "obedient tool," so that he can smoothly carry out peaceful evolution. For us proletarian revolutionaries, we must observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat and unconditionally accept the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. At the same time, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Leaders who harm the revolution should not be unconditionally accepted, but should be resolutely resisted." In this great proletarian cultural revolution, some Communist Party members and party cadres, due to the small group of big and small capitalist-roaders in the party using _Cultivation_ as a "tightening spell," poisoning them, had once become captives of the bourgeois reactionary line and lost their way. Now, the "tightening spell" of the small group of big and small capitalist-roaders in the party is no longer effective! The vast proletarian cultural revolution army has united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and the small group of big and small capitalist-roaders in the party have been completely isolated and are about to perish!

China's Khrushchev advocates "peace within the party" for another political purpose, which is to indulge some people within the party who have serious bourgeois ideology to hide from the wind, resist reform, so as to gradually cultivate them into bourgeois successors. _Cultivation_ puts on a benevolent face, saying that no matter who you are, as long as you have "fought various hardships and difficulties with the counter-revolutionaries," then you "returning to the embrace of your great mother (referring to our party) should be encouraged, comforted, and loved, and should not be subjected to any blows and grievances." At the same time, he advocates mutual "tolerance," "forbearance," and "bending over backwards," "even in necessary times, being able to endure various misunderstandings and humiliations without any resentment."

Chairman Mao advocates active ideological struggle, while the proponents of "bending over backwards" are exactly the opposite. "Bending over backwards" is to temporarily restrain oneself, and "seeking completeness" is to let bourgeois ideology be completely preserved. Preserve it for what? It can be used by the number one capitalist-roader in the party for restoration. However, the wheel of historical development always rolls forward in the opposite direction imagined by the big bosses riding on the heads of the people. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have taken action, finally smashing to pieces the dream of restoration of this number one capitalist-roader in the party.

China's Khrushchev advocates "peace within the party" for another political purpose, which is to attempt to cover up and harbor a small group of traitors and class enemies, to prepare the organization for his usurpation of the party, the government, and the military. The most prominent example is that on the eve of the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he instructed some Communist Party members in enemy prisons to surrender and betray the party. Some traitors abandoned revolutionary political principles and publicly issued a _Statement Against the Communists_, vowing to "firmly oppose the Communists." Later, under his cover, they infiltrated many important positions in party and government agencies, usurping the proletarian leadership of these places and units. In order to whitewash his own and the betrayal and surrender of this group of foxes and dogs, this Chinese Khrushchev even peddles the philosophy of traitors and the philosophy of survival in _Cultivation_. He absurdly says that Communist Party members should "love themselves, protect their own lives and health," and he orders the party organization: "In necessary times, even some of the party's work should be abandoned to preserve comrades." In the eyes of the author of _Cultivation_, revolutionary sacrifice is guilty, betrayal and surrender are glorious. Compared to the "curved national salvation" fallacy of the Kuomintang traitors and spies, and Khrushchev's "losing one's head, what good is the ideology," the philosophy of survival is not only more than but also less than?

	Should We Carry Out Class Struggle Within Our Own Minds?

Communist Party members must strive for communism all their lives. What is communism? In a certain sense, communism is "public" production, it is for the public. A society that is for the public must be created by new people who are for the public. Those with minds full of selfish thoughts can never understand communism, let alone make their due contributions to this most beautiful ideal of humanity.

The struggle between public and private is the reflection of class struggle within one's own mind. We must study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a motto, using the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought to constantly break private thoughts and establish public thoughts in our minds, achieving what Chairman Mao hopes we will become: "a noble person, a pure person, a person of virtue, a person who has broken away from low desires, a person who is beneficial to the people."

_Cultivation_ is a "private character classic." The black line running through the entire book is a "private" character. Everything starts from "private," with "private" as the center, opening and closing with "my" progress, "my" position, "my" reputation. _Cultivation_ seems to also talk about ideological struggle, but why should we engage in ideological struggle? "If the result is not like this (indicating that the ideological struggle has not been victorious)... then he will fall behind and even lose his qualifications as a Communist Party member. This is a terrible and dangerous outcome for our party members." It turns out that it is all for a "me," not for the revolutionary cause of the proletariat! Such so-called "ideological struggle" is the exact opposite of Chairman Mao's proposal of "we advocate active ideological struggle."

The struggle between public and private is concentrated in the attitude towards the masses. Chairman Mao has taught us: "All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people to serve." However, the author of _Cultivation_ writes about being an official and a lord, about being an official and a lord. Do you want to be an official and a lord? He gives you a "magic formula": do not "self-abandon" and do not "hesitate," but "strive to temper yourself and cultivate yourself seriously." He openly calls on young students to return to the countryside to farm for three to five years, and they can "become township, county, and provincial cadres," and if you have "ability," you can even come to the "central"! If you do this, fearing that others will say you are seeking fame and position, he has already made thorough arrangements for you in _Cultivation_. First, he fights for the legal position of this evil "private" character within the party. What "party members still have some personal problems that need to be handled by themselves, and also need to develop themselves according to their personality and specialties," what "the party will, under all possible conditions, help party members to develop their personality and specialties according to the requirements of the party's interests, give them appropriate work and conditions, and even reward them." Second, he gives you another "magic formula": do not bother to calculate fame and position, just work hard, and fame and position will come to you. This is the bourgeois individualist philosophy he advocates: "suffer a little loss first, and gain a big advantage later."

Is it to be a wholehearted servant of the people, or to ride on the heads of the people and be an official and a lord? Is it for the people, or for oneself? In a word, is it for the public, or for the private? This is the core issue that distinguishes the proletarian worldview from the bourgeois worldview. The revisionist party claims to be a "party of the whole people," but in reality, it serves a small clique of privileged classes! To the people, they are the most shameless bloodsuckers, the most brutal rulers! China's Khrushchev attempts to create a legal position for "private" within the party. He wants to change the nature of our party, isn't it obvious?

On the fundamental issue of how to treat the masses, China's Khrushchev is completely opposed to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. In this cultural revolution, he, together with another biggest capitalist-roader in the party, put forward a bourgeois reactionary line, steadfastly standing on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie, suppressing the revolutionary masses. They have been lords for so long, and when they see a batch of "little ghosts" armed with Mao Zedong Thought rising up to overthrow them, these few "kings," they distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, encircle the revolutionary faction, suppress different opinions, and implement a whole set of fascist methods. They not only do this themselves, but also collude with some people from the central to local levels to do the same. How poisonous it is!

_Cultivation_ is a big poisonous weed against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

_Cultivation_ is the spiritual opium that poisons the people.

If the conspiracy of the number one capitalist-roader in the party is allowed to succeed, the power seized by the revolutionary forerunners through blood and sacrifice will be lost, bourgeois dictatorship will replace proletarian dictatorship, and China will return to the old road of semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. This is a great struggle that decides the fate of China, decides the fate of the Chinese people, and also influences and decides the fate of all mankind. This is a struggle of such great importance!

"In June, the heavenly soldiers march to destroy evil, and a ten-thousand-foot long rope is used to bind the rocs." Let us further mobilize urgently, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hoist the banner of revolutionary criticism, speak loudly about class struggle, speak loudly about proletarian dictatorship, unite as one, criticize and denounce with both mouth and pen, carry out a mass criticism movement, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist words and deeds of the number one capitalist-roader in the party in the political, economic, and cultural fields, and thoroughly criticize the theoretical and ideological foundation of this bourgeois reactionary line—_Cultivation_!

    共产党就是要搞阶级斗争
    ——揭穿《修养》脱离现实的阶级斗争的反动本质
    丁学雷
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么要有革命党？因为世界上有压迫人民的敌人存在，人民要推翻敌人的压迫，所以要有革命党。”我们共产党不是干别的事情，就是搞阶级斗争的，就是要从反动统治阶级手里夺取政权，就是要搞无产阶级专政。这是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的一个最根本最核心的问题。如果不搞阶级斗争，不搞无产阶级专政，共产党就可以取消。
    阶级斗争是不以人们意志为转移的客观存在。人类自有阶级以来，古今中外，在社会的各个领域里面，最基本的问题，影响一切的问题，就是阶级斗争。“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”在社会主义条件下，阶级斗争是否象党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所说的那样“熄灭”了呢？没有，绝对没有。毛主席再三向我们指出：整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。要不要搞阶级斗争，是要不要坚持无产阶级专政，要不要坚持社会主义道路的问题。《修养》是一本专讲共产党员“修养”的书，可是却脱离现实的阶级斗争，不讲夺取政权，不讲无产阶级专政，专讲资产阶级的个人“修养”。这就是《修养》的反动本质，它的要害所在。如果照《修养》讲的去做，那么，共产党员就会“修”成骑在劳动人民头上的资产阶级分子，马克思主义的党就会变成修正主义的党、法西斯党，请同志们想一想，这是多么危险啊！
    要不要积极投入现实社会的阶级斗争？要不要开展党内的阶级斗争？要不要开展自己头脑中的阶级斗争？在这些根本问题上，《修养》是完全同毛泽东思想相对抗的。
    要不要积极投入现实
        社会的阶级斗争？
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”毛主席还说：“如果我们的党员，一生一世坐在房子里不出去，不经风雨，不见世面，这种党员，对于中国人民究竟有什么好处没有呢？一点好处也没有的，我们不需要这样的人做党员。”而《修养》的作者却要我们的共产党员闭门“修养”，学习孔子是如何到达“七十而从心所欲，不逾矩”的，孟子是如何“劳其筋骨，饿其体肤”的，曾子又是如何“吾日三省吾身”的，至于“群众斗争的大风雨”、“大世面”等等，在这里统统不见了！这根本不是在讲共产党员修养，而是在讲深山“隐士”的修道！
    翻遍洋洋四万八千字的《修养》，看不到一个字谈现实社会的阶级斗争。在这里，是一片世外桃源式的“无差别境界”。甚至连使用的语言也是“超阶级”的，什么“自尊心”、“自爱心”，什么“人类正气”、“真正的人类同情者”，什么“杀身成仁”、“舍生取义”等等。它用大量的地主、资产阶级的政治术语、道德观念，公然与毛主席光辉的阶级斗争学说相对抗。
    这难道是偶然的疏忽吗？绝对不是！中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏联的赫鲁晓夫一样，是阶级斗争熄灭论的鼓吹迷。他十年前就宣扬什么中国国内的“阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，“地主阶级早已消灭了，资产阶级也基本上消灭了”，“无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”。一九六五年，伟大的四清运动已经在我国广阔的土地上普遍展开，运动中已揭出了大量触目惊心的阶级斗争事实。但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫仍然否认无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的矛盾，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的矛盾。毛主席明确指出：四清运动要解决的是社会主义和资本主义的矛盾。而他却胡说什么四清运动的性质是四清和四不清的矛盾，党内外矛盾的交叉，或者是敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的交叉。
    在《修养》的炮制者看来，共产党员之所以需要锻炼和修养，只是因为每个党员经常同“社会中一切不好的东西接触”。好一个“不好的东西”！苏联的赫鲁晓夫还不得不提一句苏联“仍然存在着阻碍社会前进的资本主义残余”，而中国的赫鲁晓夫“修养”得更为彻底，连“资本主义”这四个字也抹掉了！
      这是一个彻头彻尾的政治谎话！
    阶级斗争有哪一年、哪一月、哪一天停止过呢？我们就从《修养》这株大毒草集中出笼推销的几个年份来看看事实吧！
    一九三九年，即《修养》第一次出笼的时候，日本帝国主义的铁蹄践踏了我国大片国土，全国人民处在水深火热之中，成千成万的中华民族的优秀儿女浴血奋战在抗日最前线，而国民党反动派却消极抗日，积极反共，并阴谋向敌人投降……。阶级斗争多么尖锐和激烈啊！
    一九四九年，即《修养》又一次大量出笼的时候，伟大的人民解放战争即将取得全国胜利，美帝国主义和国民党反动派不甘心自己的失败，从军事、政治上进行疯狂的反扑。我们伟大的领袖毛主席发出将革命进行到底的号召。进城以后，我们又面临着同资产阶级之间尖锐复杂的斗争……。阶级斗争又是多么尖锐和激烈啊！
    一九六二年，即《修养》经过精心的装扮，再度出笼的时候，国际国内的阶级斗争更是尖锐、复杂、激烈。美帝国主义、赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团和各国反动派，正在疯狂地进行反华大合唱。国内的牛鬼蛇神和被罢了官的一小撮右倾机会主义分子，一齐跑了出来，向党、向社会主义发起了疯狂进攻。那些“三家村”、“四家店”中的“英雄好汉”们，更是杀气腾腾地狂喊：“莫谓书生空议论，头颅掷处血斑斑！”蒋介石匪帮也在美帝国主义的唆使下，声嘶力竭地叫嚣窜犯大陆的“时机已经成熟”……。阶级斗争又是多么尖锐和激烈啊！
    但是，在这几个重要的历史关键时刻一版再版的《修养》，既没有号召共产党员奔赴抗日前线英勇杀敌，也没有提醒共产党员必须将革命进行到底，更没有要求共产党员在反帝反修和回击国内阶级敌人的猖狂进攻中英勇战斗。所有这一切关系到国家和民族生死存亡的阶级大搏斗，都没有进入《修养》作者的眼里。在他看来，共产党员的最高任务就是闭门“修养”。修吧，修吧，修到“功德圆满”日，老天爷就将“降大任于斯人也”！
    同志们！这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，难道真的变成深山“隐士”式的人物了吗？不，他可不那么糊涂。他叫别人忘记阶级斗争，本身就是一种阶级斗争，他自己一直在那里搞资产阶级的阶级斗争，处心积虑地搞政变，搞篡党、篡政、篡军的阴谋活动。无产阶级专政的历史经验提醒我们，无产阶级在夺取政权之后，不论有着怎样千头万绪的事，都永远不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记无产阶级专政。忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了无产阶级专政，就是忘记了政治，忘记了马克思主义的根本，那就是糊涂人，就会舒舒服服地变成修正主义。
      要不要开展党内的
            阶级斗争？
    一部中国共产党的历史，始终贯穿着两条路线的斗争。毛主席教导我们：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”但《修养》的作者却公然与我们敬爱的领袖毛主席唱反调。他以反对“平地起风波”为名，诬蔑党内斗争，竭力鼓吹“党内和平”，明目张胆地抽掉了党内斗争的阶级内容，说什么：“因为各种党员看问题的方法不同，就使他们处理问题的方法也各不相同，就引起党内许多不同意见、不同主张的分歧和争论，就引起党内的斗争。”
    否定党内斗争的阶级内容，也就否定了党内斗争。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派真是不搞党内的阶级斗争么？不！他是搞党内斗争的老手，不过他不是站在无产阶级立场上搞党内斗争，而是站在资产阶级反动立场上搞党内斗争。他故意抹杀党内斗争的阶级内容，有他不可告人的目的。
    首先，是要在“党内和平”的幌子下，对广大党员推销他的奴隶主义。毛主席教导我们说：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”但这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却用奴隶主义的精神枷锁来束缚广大党员，不让他们按照毛主席的指示办事。他反反复复地强调盲目服从，“一切附有条件的服从都是不对的。应该是无条件的绝对的服从”，“只要是大多数，是上级或中央通过和决定了的，就要服从，就是不对也要服从。”
    这个中国的赫鲁晓夫如此起劲地推销奴隶主义，为的是使你变成他“得心应手”的“驯服工具”，好让他顺顺当当地搞和平演变。对于我们无产阶级革命派来说，我们必须遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，必须无条件地接受以毛主席为首的党中央的领导。同时，我们也要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制。”在这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，有一些共产党员和党的干部，由于党内一小撮大大小小走资本主义道路当权派拿了《修养》作“紧箍咒”，毒害他们，曾经一度成为资产阶级反动路线的俘虏，迷失了方向。现在，党内一小撮大大小小走资本主义道路当权派的“紧箍咒”都不灵了！浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军已经在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下联合起来了，党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路的当权派已经彻底孤立，快要完蛋了！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫宣扬“党内和平”的又一个政治目的，就是为了纵容党内一些有严重的资产阶级思想的人，躲避风头，抗拒改造，以便逐步把他们培养成为资产阶级接班人。《修养》装出一副慈悲面孔说，不管你是什么人，只要你是“和反革命进行了各种艰难困苦的战斗”的，那么，你“回到自己伟大母亲（指我们的党）的怀抱中来，是应该受到各种鼓励、安慰和抚爱，而不应该受到任何打击和委屈”的。同时他还鼓吹互相“宽大”、“容忍”和“委曲求全”，“甚至在必要的时候能够忍受各种误解和屈辱而毫无怨恨之心”。
    毛主席主张积极的思想斗争，而“委曲求全”论者恰好相反。“委曲”就是暂时约束一下自己，“求全”就是让资产阶级思想统统保留下来。保留下来干什么呢？可以给党内头号走资本主义道路当权派作为复辟之用。但是，历史发展的车轮，始终是朝着骑在人民头上的大老爷所设想的反面滚滚向前。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，亿万革命群众纷纷行动起来，终于彻底粉碎了这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的复辟美梦。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫宣扬“党内和平”的再一个政治目的，是企图包庇、窝藏一小撮叛徒、阶级异己分子，为他篡党、篡政、篡军作组织准备。其中最突出的一个事例就是，抗日战争爆发前夕，他指使一些在敌人监狱中的共产党员自首变节，投降国民党，叛变共产党。一些变节分子就抛弃革命的政治原则，公开发表《反共启事》，宣誓“坚决反共”，以后又在他的包庇下，打进党政机关的许多重要岗位，篡夺了这些地方和单位的无产阶级领导权。为了给自己，给这一窝狐群狗党变节自首的叛变行为涂脂抹粉，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫竟在《修养》中大肆贩卖叛徒哲学、活命哲学。他胡说什么共产党员应该“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，他还下令党组织：“在必要时还要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”。在《修养》作者的笔下，革命牺牲有罪，变节投敌光荣，这与国民党汉奸特务的“曲线救国”的谬论，同赫鲁晓夫“丢了脑袋，主义还有什么好处”的活命哲学相比，不是有过之而无不及吗？
    要不要开展自己头脑
        中的阶级斗争？
    共产党员要为共产主义奋斗终生。什么叫共产主义呢？在一定意义上说，共产主义就是“公”产主义，就是为公。一心为公的社会必须由一心为公的新人来开创。满脑子私心杂念的人，根本不可能理解共产主义，更不可能为这人类最美好的理想作出自己应有的贡献。
    公和私的斗争，就是阶级斗争在自己头脑中的反映。我们一定要把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，用光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想不断地在自己头脑中破私立公，实现毛主席殷切期望我们做到的“一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。
    《修养》是一本“私字经”。贯串全书的黑线就是一个“私”字。一切从“私”字出发，以“私”为中心，开口闭口离不开“我”的进步，“我”的地位，“我”的声誉。《修养》里似乎也讲思想斗争的，但为什么要进行思想斗争呢？“如果结局不是这样（指思想斗争没有胜利）的话，……那末他就会落后，以至失去共产党员的资格。这对于我们党员来说，是一种可怕的危险的结局。”原来，又是为了一个“我”，而不是为了无产阶级的革命事业！这样的所谓“思想斗争”与毛主席提出的“我们主张积极的思想斗争”是正相反对的。
    公与私的斗争，集中地表现在对待群众的问题上。毛主席教导我们说，“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务。”而《修养》作者写的是做官当老爷，讲的是做官当老爷。你想做官当老爷吗？他给你一个“妙方”：不要“自暴自弃”，不要“畏葸不前”，而要“努力锻炼，认真修养”。他公开号召青年学生回乡种三五年地，就能“当乡、县、省干部”，你有“本事”，“也可以到中央”来！如果你这样干，怕别人说你闹名誉地位，他早在《修养》里为你作了周到的安排。第一，他为你这个万恶的“私”字在党内争取合法地位。什么“党员总还有一部分私人的问题需要自己来处理，并且也还要根据他的个性和特长来发展他自己”，什么“党在一切可能条件下还要帮助党员根据党的利益的要求，去发展他的个性和特长，给他以适当的工作和条件，以至加以奖励等。”第二，他再给你一个“妙法”：自己不要去计较名誉地位，埋头干去，名誉地位就会送上门来的。这就是他所提倡的“先吃点小亏，后占大便宜”的资产阶级个人主义的哲学。
    是全心全意做人民的勤务员，还是骑在人民头上做官当老爷？是为人民，还是为自己？一句话，是为公，还是为私？这是无产阶级世界观区别于资产阶级世界观的核心问题。修正主义的党，宣称自己是什么“全民党”，其实是为一小撮特权阶层服务的。对于人民，他们是最无耻的吸血鬼、最残暴的统治者！中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图在党内为“私”字制造合法地位，他要想改变我们党的性质，不是很明显了吗？
    在怎样对待群众这个原则问题上，中国的赫鲁晓夫与马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想完全唱反调。在这次文化大革命中，他伙同党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派，提出了一条资产阶级反动路线，顽固地站在资产阶级反动立场上，压制革命群众。他们当大老爷当惯了，一看用毛泽东思想武装起来的一批“小鬼”，要起来打倒他们这几个“阎王”，他们就颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，一整套法西斯手段都用了出来。他们不仅自己这样干，还从中央到地方，串通一些人，一起这样干。真是何其毒也。
    《修养》是反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大毒草。
    《修养》是毒害人民的精神鸦片。
    如果让党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋得逞了，革命前辈流血牺牲奋斗夺得来的政权就会失去，资产阶级专政就会代替无产阶级专政，中国就会重新回到半殖民地半封建社会的老路。这是决定中国向何处去，决定中国的命运，也影响和决定整个人类命运的大事情。这是关系多么重大的一场大斗争啊！
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”让我们进一步紧急动员起来，活学活用毛主席著作，高举革命的批判旗帜，大讲阶级斗争，大讲无产阶级专政，万众一心，口诛笔伐，开展群众性的批判运动，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在政治、经济、文化各个领域中的反革命修正主义言行，彻底批判这条资产阶级反动路线的理论基础和思想基础——《修养》！
