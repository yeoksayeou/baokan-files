Capital's 15,000 Revolutionary Masses Hold Massive Rally and March
Fiercely Denounce the Mongolian Revisionist Regime's Anti-China Atrocities in Tandem with Soviet Revisionism
Firmly Support the Just Struggle of Our Personnel in Mongolia and Patriotic Overseas Chinese; Warmly Welcome the Return of Three Overseas Chinese Anti-Revisionist Fighters

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 26th, over 15,000 revolutionary masses from various sectors in Beijing held a rally at the Workers' Stadium today to warmly welcome Wang Zhiyun, Chen Lu, and Zuo Guiyi, three overseas Chinese anti-revisionist fighters who were unjustly expelled by the Mongolian revisionist regime. The rally fiercely denounced the fascist anti-China atrocities committed by the Mongolian revisionist regime.

The meeting strongly condemned the Mongolian revisionist leadership for acting as Soviet revisionists' anti-China lackeys, savagely persecuting our patriotic overseas Chinese, and assaulting and detaining our diplomatic personnel. The meeting vowed to firmly support the just struggle of our personnel in Mongolia and the broad patriotic overseas Chinese against the persecution by the Mongolian revisionists, and to be their steadfast backbone. The meeting pointed out that the Mongolian revisionist leadership's anti-China and anti-Chinese policies, following the Soviet revisionists, do not represent the will of the broad Mongolian people. The anti-China and anti-Chinese policies of the Mongolian revisionist leadership will only backfire and will not end well!

Today, the revolutionary masses of the capital waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly raised their fists, shouting: "Strongly protest the Mongolian revisionists' assault and detention of our diplomatic personnel!" "The Mongolian revisionists following the Soviet revisionists in anti-China actions will not end well!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Mongolian revisionist lackeys of Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

The meeting began with the entire audience singing "The East Is Red" and "The Internationale" and reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law independent of man's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the advance of the historical wheel, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious, whether sooner or later."

Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Wu De spoke at the meeting. He said that our broad overseas Chinese in Mongolia, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have raised the banner of proletarian internationalism and patriotism, lived in friendship with the Mongolian people, established deep feelings, and made contributions to the construction of the Mongolian people and the promotion of friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia.

Wu De severely condemned the Mongolian revisionist leadership for fearing Mao Zedong Thought, persecuting our patriotic overseas Chinese, and unjustly expelling comrades Wang Zhiyun and others. He said that the Mongolian revisionist leadership's atrocities are a deliberate sabotage of the friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia, a disregard for the basic principles of diplomatic relations, and a rare fascist atrocity in the history of international relations.

Wu De praised the personnel of our embassy in Mongolia and the patriotic overseas Chinese for their heroic struggle against the Mongolian revisionist fascist thugs, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They are truly good sons and daughters of the motherland.

Wu De said that the Mongolian revisionist leadership's fascist anti-China atrocities this time are not accidental. Over the years, under the direction of the Soviet revisionists, the Mongolian revisionist leadership has been the vanguard of anti-China actions. They have used various propaganda machines to continuously issue anti-China rhetoric. Especially since our country launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have been terrified and enraged by this unprecedented cultural revolution and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. Under the instigation of the Soviet revisionists, the Mongolian revisionist leadership has repeatedly outrageously worsened the relations between the two countries, torn up a series of agreements and protocols signed between the two governments, and arbitrarily insulted, discriminated against, and maltreated the Chinese institutions, aid personnel, and overseas Chinese in Mongolia. The Mongolian revisionist leadership has gone far down the anti-China path. The more they rampage, the more it shows their weakness and further exposes their ugly faces as lackeys of Soviet revisionism.

Wu De said that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already lodged the strongest protest and made serious demands to the Mongolian government. The Mongolian government must fulfill the reasonable demands of the Chinese government. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of our personnel in Mongolia and patriotic overseas Chinese against the persecution by the Mongolian revisionists and vow to be their steadfast backbone.

Wu De said that the anti-China rampage of a small clique of Mongolian revisionist leaders is just a small clown in the current anti-China chorus of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in the world. Recently, British imperialism has also carried out savage fascist suppression against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of British imperialism. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately and unconditionally fulfill the five demands of our government.

Wu De concluded by saying that now, the world is entering a new historical era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. No matter how imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries struggle in their death throes, they will inevitably be thoroughly buried by the revolutionary people of the world. A new world bathed in the sunlight of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely come.

Overseas Chinese anti-revisionist fighter Wang Zhiyun spoke amid enthusiastic applause. He said, "We have returned to the motherland we have longed for day and night, and returned to the side of our great leader Chairman Mao. Let us shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' ten thousand times! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The patriotic overseas Chinese and revolutionary teachers and students in Mongolia day and night think of you. They asked us to convey their boundless love, faith, and admiration for you and wish you eternal life."

Wang Zhiyun angrily condemned the Mongolian revisionists' persecution and unjust expulsion of patriotic overseas Chinese. He said that the Mongolian revisionist leadership is extremely afraid of patriotic overseas Chinese learning and mastering the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the revolutionary people of Mongolia. In March, during the International Union of Students' Ninth Congress in Ulaanbaatar, representatives from various countries came to the newsstand of the Overseas Chinese Association in Mongolia every day, took photos under Chairman Mao's portrait, asked for Chairman Mao's badges and quotations, and sang "The Internationale" with our students. The Mongolian revisionists were terrified by this just revolutionary action. They did not notify us in advance and unilaterally closed the shared door of the Overseas Chinese Association in Mongolia and the "Mongolian News" office, preventing students from entering the courtyard to attend classes. In this situation, we and the students naturally had to knock on the door, but the Mongolian authorities actually sent police cars to deal with us, a few dozen revolutionary teachers and students. He said that the revolutionary teachers and students armed with Mao Zedong Thought fearlessly stood tall and fought back, refuting them with righteousness and logic until they had no words left. Finally, they had to open the door and let us in, quickly getting into their cars and fleeing with their tails between their legs. But the Mongolian revisionists were not willing to admit their defeat. They twisted right and wrong, confusing black and white, and falsely accused us of leading students to kick and smash the door of the "Mongolian News" office, violating Mongolian law, and even demanded that we admit our mistakes, apologize, and promise not to repeat such incidents. This is absurd and shameless. We firmly rejected it. After the Mongolian revisionists' threats completely failed, they flew into a rage and unjustly ordered us three to leave Mongolia within a deadline.

Wang Zhiyun then recounted the Mongolian revisionists' savage persecution of our embassy personnel and patriotic overseas Chinese who came to see them off.

Wang Zhiyun said that although a small clique of Mongolian revisionist leaders are trying to restore capitalism in Mongolia and impose fascist rule on the Mongolian people, the broad Mongolian people want revolution and love the Chinese people. They, like revolutionary people all over the world, yearn for Beijing and look up to the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. We often encountered many Mongolian workers, intellectuals, and schoolchildren singing "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" translated into Mongolian, or raising their hands and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" in Chinese.

Wang Zhiyun said that the Mongolian people are very dissatisfied with the Mongolian authorities' persecution of overseas Chinese. When they heard the news of our expulsion, they were indignant and many of them had tears in their eyes as they hugged and kissed us. They said, "Friends, you go! When we overthrow them, you come back."

A representative of the returned aid workers to Mongolia spoke and paid high tribute to the three anti-revisionist fighters who had returned from Mongolia with a revolutionary salute of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that since 1957, our tens of thousands of aid workers in Mongolia have, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, faithfully fulfilled their internationalist duties, provided extensive economic and technological assistance to the Mongolian people, and completed dozens of turnkey projects. However, the Mongolian revisionist leadership is terrified of Mao Zedong Thought. They constantly create provocations, persecute our workers, and make our aid personnel's personal safety unguaranteed. They obstruct and hinder our aid work in every possible way, seriously affecting the normal progress of aid projects. This year, under the instructions of their Soviet revisionist masters, the Mongolian revisionist leadership deliberately worsened relations between China and Mongolia. To this day, they have not issued entry visas to our aid personnel, causing a large number of our personnel to be unable to go to Mongolia to work, resulting in huge losses. The Mongolian revisionist leadership must bear full responsibility for unilaterally violating the economic and technological aid agreements between China and Mongolia.

Representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, People's Liberation Army units in Beijing, the Red Guards of Beijing's colleges and universities, and the Red Guards of secondary schools spoke, strongly condemning the Mongolian revisionists for following the Soviet revisionists in creating anti-China atrocities, and paying revolutionary salutes of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the overseas Chinese anti-revisionist fighters.

Today's meeting was presided over by Deputy Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Nie Yuanzi. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, as well as responsible officials from relevant departments and representatives of the revolutionary masses, attended the meeting.

At the end of the meeting, the entire audience sang "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." Subsequently, revolutionary masses from various sectors surged towards the Mongolian Embassy in China to protest and demonstrate, strongly protesting the Mongolian revisionists' fascist anti-China atrocities.

    首都一万五千革命群众举行声势浩大的集会游行
    愤怒声讨蒙修当局追随苏修反华暴行
    坚决支持我驻蒙人员和爱国华侨的正义斗争，热烈欢迎三位华侨反修战士归来
    据新华社二十六日讯　北京市各界革命群众一万五千多人，今天在工人体育馆举行集会，热烈欢迎被蒙古修正主义当局无理驱逐出境的王志云、陈禄、左贵义三位华侨反修战士，愤怒声讨蒙古修正主义当局的法西斯反华暴行。
    大会强烈谴责蒙古修正主义领导集团充当苏修反华走卒，疯狂迫害我爱国华侨和殴打、拘捕我外交人员，蓄意恶化中蒙两国关系，制造反华流血事件的法西斯行为。大会表示，中国人民坚决支持我国驻蒙人员和广大爱国华侨反对蒙古修正主义迫害的正义斗争，誓作他们的坚强后盾。大会指出，蒙古修正主义领导集团追随苏修进行反华排华，绝不能代表广大蒙古人民的意志。蒙古修正主义领导集团反华排华只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，决不会有好下场！
    今天，首都革命群众挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不断地振臂高呼：“强烈抗议蒙修殴打、扣留我国外交人员！”“蒙修追随苏修反华决没有好下场！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒苏修走卒蒙修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    大会开始，全场高唱《东方红》和《国际歌》，并且齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    北京市革命委员会副主任委员吴德在大会上讲话。他说，我国广大旅蒙华侨，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，高举无产阶级国际主义和爱国主义的旗帜，同蒙古人民友好相处，建立了深厚感情，为蒙古人民的建设事业和增进中蒙两国人民友谊作出了贡献。
    吴德严厉谴责蒙修领导集团害怕毛泽东思想，对我爱国华侨横加迫害，无理驱逐王志云等三同志出境，并殴打和拘捕我外交人员。他说，蒙修领导集团的暴行，是对中蒙两国人民友谊的蓄意破坏，是不顾起码的外交关系准则，是国际关系史上罕见的法西斯暴行。
    吴德赞扬说，我国驻蒙大使馆人员和爱国侨胞，同蒙修法西斯暴徒展开了英勇的斗争，表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民的英雄气概。他们真不愧为祖国的好儿女。
    吴德说，蒙古修正主义领导集团制造这一次法西斯反华暴行，绝不是偶然的。多年来，蒙古修正主义领导集团在苏修的指挥棒下，充当了反华的急先锋，他们开动各种宣传机器，不断发出反华叫嚣。特别是我国开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们对于这场史无前例的文化大革命和光焰无际的毛泽东思想，更是怕得要死，恨得要命。蒙修领导集团在苏修的唆使下，还一再丧心病狂地恶化中蒙国家关系，先后撕毁了一系列两国政府间签订的协定和协议，对中国驻蒙机构、援蒙人员和侨民恣意进行侮辱、歧视和虐待。蒙修领导集团在反华的绝路上已经走得很远了。他们越是猖狂，只能表明他们更加虚弱，只能进一步暴露出他们充当苏修反华走卒的丑恶嘴脸。
    吴德说，我国外交部已经向蒙古政府提出了最强烈的抗议和严正要求。蒙古政府必须实现中国政府的合理要求。中国人民坚决支持我国驻蒙人员和爱国华侨反对蒙修迫害的正义斗争，誓作他们的坚强后盾。
    吴德说，蒙古一小撮修正主义头头们的猖狂反华，只是当前世界上帝、修、反反华合唱队中的一个跳梁小丑。最近，英帝国主义也对我香港爱国同胞进行了疯狂的法西斯镇压。中国人民坚决支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争，坚决抗议英帝国主义的法西斯暴行。英国政府和香港英国当局必须立即无条件实现我国政府的五项要求。
    吴德最后说，现在，全世界正在进入一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的崭新的历史时代。不管帝、修、反怎样进行垂死挣扎，都必将被世界革命人民彻底埋葬。一个马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阳光普照的红彤彤的新世界必将来临。
    华侨反修战士王志云在热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，我们回到了日夜想念的祖国，回到了我们伟大领袖毛主席的身边。让我们千遍万遍地高呼毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！！毛主席呀，毛主席！侨居蒙古的爱国华侨和侨校革命师生日夜想念着您老人家。他们让我们转达对您无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜的心情，祝您老人家万寿无疆。
    王志云愤怒谴责蒙修对爱国华侨的迫害和无理驱逐他们的暴行。他说，蒙古修正主义领导集团十分害怕爱国华侨学习和掌握光焰无际的毛泽东思想，害怕我国无产阶级文化大革命对蒙古革命人民的巨大影响。今年三月间，国际学联九大在乌兰巴托举行期间，每天都有各国代表团来旅蒙华侨协会的新闻橱窗前，在毛主席像下摄影留念，向我们索取毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，还和我们学生联欢，共同高唱《国际歌》。蒙修被这正义的革命行动吓得慌了手脚。他们事先不通知我们，单方面把旅蒙华侨协会和《蒙古消息报》社共用的大门关上，使学生不能进院上课。在这种情况下，我们和学生当然要敲门，但是蒙修当局竟然出动警车，前来对付我们几十个革命师生。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命师生临危不惧，昂然挺立，坚持斗争，义正词严地把他们驳得理屈词穷。最后他们只好乖乖地打开了大门，让我们进去，自己急忙上车，灰溜溜地夹着尾巴跑掉了。但是，蒙修是不甘心自己的失败的，他们颠倒黑白，混淆是非，胡说什么我们带领学生踢打《蒙古消息报》社大门，破坏了蒙古法律，甚至要我们承认错误，赔礼道歉，保证今后不再发生类似事件。这真是荒唐可笑，无耻透顶。我们坚决把它顶回去了。蒙修的威胁彻底破产后，恼羞成怒，竟然无理地勒令我们三人限期离开蒙古。
    王志云接着控诉了蒙修在他们动身回国时，对为他们送行的我使馆人员和爱国侨胞的野蛮迫害。
    王志云说，尽管蒙古一小撮修正主义头头竭力要在蒙古复辟资本主义，对蒙古人民实行法西斯统治。但是，广大的蒙古人民是要革命的，是热爱中国人民的。他们象全世界革命人民一样向往着北京，仰望着全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。我们经常遇到许多蒙古劳动人民、知识分子、小学生对我们唱译成蒙语的《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》，或者举起手，用中国话喊“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    王志云说，蒙古人民对蒙修当局迫害华侨是非常不满的。当他们知道我们被驱逐出境的消息后，义愤填膺，不少人热泪盈眶地把我们亲了又亲，抱了又抱。他们说：“朋友们，你们走吧！等我们推翻了他们，你们再回来。”
    已经回国的援蒙工人代表在讲话中向从蒙古胜利归来的三位反修战士致以崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼。他说自一九五七年以来，我们中国援蒙建设的数万名员工，按照伟大的领袖毛主席的教导，忠实地履行了无产阶级国际主义的义务，对蒙古人民进行了大量的经济技术援助，完成了数十项成套工程项目。但是蒙古修正主义领导集团对毛泽东思想害怕得要死，他们不断制造种种挑衅，迫害我国工人，使我援蒙人员的人身安全得不到保证；对我援蒙工作进行百般刁难和阻挠，严重地影响了援蒙工程的正常进行。今年蒙修领导集团秉承其主子苏修的旨意，蓄意进一步恶化中蒙两国关系。至今不发给我援蒙人员入境签证，致使我国大批人员无法去蒙古施工，造成了巨大损失。蒙修领导集团必须承担单方面破坏中蒙两国经济技术援助协定的全部责任。
    北京市工代会、农代会、人民解放军驻北京部队、首都大专院校红代会、中等学校红代会代表在讲话中，强烈谴责蒙修追随苏修制造反华暴行，并且向华侨反修战士致以无产阶级文化大革命的敬礼。
    今天的大会由北京市革命委员会副主任委员聂元梓主持。外交部副部长韩念龙，以及各有关方面的负责人和无产阶级革命派代表，出席了大会。
    大会结束时，全场高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。随后，各界革命群众队伍，涌向蒙古驻中国大使馆门前游行示威，强烈抗议蒙修法西斯的反华暴行。
