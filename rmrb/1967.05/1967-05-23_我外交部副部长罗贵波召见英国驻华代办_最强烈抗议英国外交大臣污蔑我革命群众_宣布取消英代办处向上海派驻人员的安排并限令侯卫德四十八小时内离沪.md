	Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Guibo summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires.

	The strongest protest was lodged against the British Foreign Secretary's slander of our revolutionary masses.

	The arrangement for the British Chargé d'Affaires to dispatch personnel to Shanghai was canceled, and Hou Weide was ordered to leave Shanghai within 48 hours.

	Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: Since the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on May 15th, the British government has not only failed to respond to the serious demands in our statement, but has instead intensified its fascist atrocities in Hong Kong. On May 19th, British Foreign Secretary Brown, when meeting with the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in the UK, shamelessly slandered the just actions of our revolutionary masses as "riots," defamed our revolutionary masses as "hooligans," and adopted extremely arrogant and unreasonable rude attitudes towards our diplomatic representatives. In response, Vice Foreign Minister Luo Guibo summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hopkins, at 5:30 PM today, to lodge the strongest protest. At the same time, it was announced that the Chinese government has decided to cancel the arrangement for the British Chargé d'Affaires to dispatch personnel to Shanghai to handle consular affairs, and ordered them to leave Shanghai within 48 hours.

	Vice Minister Luo Guibo first pointed out: "Since the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on May 15th, the British authorities in Hong Kong have continued to deploy large numbers of police, secret agents, and even military vehicles and helicopters to deal with unarmed Chinese residents. In the past ten days, more than six or seven hundred people have been illegally arrested and sentenced, including more than sixty-year-old elders and children around ten years old, who have been subjected to brutal treatment and sentenced to imprisonment. This is a blatant fascist atrocity, and we absolutely cannot tolerate it."

	Vice Minister Luo Guibo went on to say: "The British authorities in Hong Kong are continuing to expand their fascist atrocities," and sternly demanded: "The British government must immediately stop the persecution of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and promptly respond to the five demands in the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement."

	Vice Minister Luo Guibo emphasized: "On May 19th, British Foreign Secretary Brown, when meeting with the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Shen Ping, adopted an extremely arrogant and unreasonable rude attitude, used the disgraceful language of imperialism, and maliciously slandered the Chinese revolutionary masses. We express great indignation and lodge the strongest protest against this."

	Vice Minister Luo Guibo finally pointed out: "Due to the British government's hostile attitude towards the Chinese people, and especially due to the bloody atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong against Chinese residents, the arrangement made by the Chinese government in 1954 to accommodate the British government's request to allow the British Chargé d'Affaires to dispatch personnel to Shanghai to handle consular affairs has completely lost its original meaning. Therefore, the Chinese government has decided to cancel the above arrangement and order Mr. Hou Weide to leave Shanghai within 48 hours."

    我外交部副部长罗贵波召见英国驻华代办
    最强烈抗议英国外交大臣污蔑我革命群众
    宣布取消英代办处向上海派驻人员的安排并限令侯卫德四十八小时内离沪
    新华社二十二日讯　自五月十五日我国外交部发表声明以来，英国政府不但迄今未对我声明中所提出的严正要求作出答复，反而变本加厉地在香港扩大它的法西斯暴行。五月十九日英国外交大臣布朗接见我国驻英临时代办时，竟然大放厥词，污蔑我国革命群众游行示威的正义行动是“骚乱”，诽谤我国革命群众为“流氓”，并且对我国外交代表采取了极端蛮横无理的粗暴态度。对此，外交部副部长罗贵波于今日下午五时半召见英国驻华代办霍普森，提出最强烈的抗议，同时宣布中国政府决定取消英国驻华代办处向上海派驻办理侨务人员的安排，并限令其人员于四十八小时内离开上海。
    罗贵波副部长首先指出：“五月十五日，中国外交部声明发表以来，香港英国当局继续出动大批军警、特务，甚至调来军车和直升飞机，对付赤手空拳的中国居民。十多天来，六、七百人遭受无理拘捕和判刑，连六十多岁的老翁和十岁左右的小孩也被施加毒手，判处徒刑。这是不折不扣的法西斯暴行，我们绝对不能容忍。”
    罗贵波副部长接着说：“目前香港英国当局的法西斯暴行还在继续扩大”，并严正要求：“英国政府必须立即停止对香港中国居民的迫害，并且对中国外交部声明中的五点要求迅速作出答复。”
    罗贵波副部长着重指出：“五月十九日，英国外交大臣布朗在接见中国临时代办沈平先生的时候，采取了极端蛮横无理的粗暴态度，使用了可耻的帝国主义的语言，大肆污蔑中国革命群众。我们对此表示极大的愤慨，并且提出最强烈的抗议。”
    罗贵波副部长最后指出：“由于英国政府采取敌视中国人民的态度，特别是由于香港英国当局对中国居民采取的血腥暴行，一九五四年中国政府为照顾英国政府的要求而作出的同意英国驻华代办处向上海派驻办理侨务人员的安排，已完全失去原来的意义，因此，中国政府决定取消上述安排，并限令侯卫德先生于四十八小时内离开上海。”
