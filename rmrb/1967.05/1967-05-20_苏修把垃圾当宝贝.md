In the midst of the worldwide revolutionary people's enthusiastic celebration of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the struggle against the greatest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has reached a new high tide and achieved brilliant victories among the revolutionary masses of our country. The proletarian revolutionary forces on the cultural front of our country, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, have taken up the mighty club of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line supported by the greatest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, represented by Zhou Yang and others. They have smashed the feudal, capitalist, and revisionist arts to smithereens and have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois "authorities" in literature and art, leaving them with no dignity and no prestige.

The great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country has also shocked the defenders of the reactionary culture of the Soviet revisionists. They are frantically shouting: "The Cultural Revolution in China is actually a denial of culture," "literature and art have been trampled upon," "the reform of drama is actually a ban on the dramatic forms that the Chinese people love," "it actually paralyzes and destroys the cultural life of China," and so on.

Pah! The traitors to the proletarian revolutionary cause—the Soviet revisionist anti-China heroes—you say "actually" on the left and "actually" on the right. But why do you avoid discussing what culture and what art have been denied by the proletarian revolutionary forces of our country? You are like swindlers, deliberately avoiding these fundamental issues and engaging in deception and fraud!

The great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they in turn exert a great influence on politics." "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and to a certain political line."

The stern facts of class struggle and the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union have made us deeply understand: unless you overthrow feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, socialist things cannot be established; unless the proletariat occupies the field of literature and art, it will be occupied by the bourgeoisie. In the face of the rampant attacks of anti-revolutionary revisionism, true proletarian revolutionaries must give them a resounding blow. We must seize back the power over the ideological and cultural fields that has been usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party!

"Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." In this great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, the seven hundred million people of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have all become critics of the old world. We take up our pens as swords and spears, overthrowing all the feudal, capitalist, and revisionist trash, and throwing them into the dustbin of history.

In this thrilling class struggle, as we mercilessly destroy reactionary culture, we proletarian revolutionaries are also creating unprecedentedly brilliant proletarian new culture in human history. Look! On the vast land of our great motherland, the flowers of the fighting proletarian new culture are growing vigorously under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought! Revolutionary operas like "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," "The Red Lantern," "The Battle of Sha Jian Hu," "The Red Detachment of Women," and "The Red Guards Strike Back"; revolutionary ballets like "The White-Haired Girl" and "The Red Detachment of Women"; and symphonies like "The Battle of Sha Jian Hu"—these revolutionary operas, ballets, and symphonies are of epoch-making significance. It can be said without exaggeration that they are the most outstanding and advanced works ever to appear on the stage. These brilliant achievements are loved by the laboring people of our country and are also warmly praised by the revolutionary people of the world.

The Soviet revisionist traitors turn a blind eye to the rich fruits of our proletarian culture but desperately plead for the reactionary culture that has been overthrown in our country, wailing loudly. As our country's cultural revolutionary pioneer Lu Xun said: "Imperialism and we, apart from its lackeys, what is not diametrically opposed to us? Our abscesses are their treasures."

Look at the Soviet Union today, and you will understand this truth even more. Those broken-down goods that we have denied and overthrown are now rampant in the Soviet Union under the dictatorship of revisionism; the capitalist trash that is spat upon by the revolutionary people is now treated as a precious jewel. Just flip through the Soviet revisionist publications, and the stench of capitalism and revisionism will hit you in the face. Recently, a so-called "poet" named Shelyvinsky even openly advocated using "female charm" to "embellish life." This is utterly shameless! And that notorious traitor Sholokhov, who has long been infamous, has recently been awarded the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor." It is highly ironic that a reactionary writer, Pasternak, who died long ago, wrote a highly reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago" that was secretly sent to capitalist countries for publication. Initially, the Soviet revisionist clique, under the pressure and anger of the Soviet people, had to announce that he was a "traitor" and an "enemy of the revolution." But today, the Soviet revisionist clique is going to publish this novel openly, which means restoring his reputation!

Today in the Soviet Union, what fills the ears is the maddening noise of Western jazz music; what floods the scene are the large number of obscene and thieving films produced by the United States and the Soviet revisionist clique... The revolutionary literary works that once inspired the Soviet people to fight bravely during the October Revolution and the Great Patriotic War have almost completely disappeared today. The many revolutionary fighting songs that once inspired the Soviet people to fight against the fascist invaders are now silent.

The Soviet revisionists' suppression of proletarian revolutionary literature and art and the promotion of bourgeois reactionary literature and art are all in the service of their full-scale restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, their implementation of the revisionist political line, and their further consolidation of their bourgeois dictatorship.

However, the Soviet revisionist leadership's implementation of revisionist rule against the will of the Soviet people cannot last long. The spark of revolution will never be extinguished in the hearts of the Soviet people. As Lu Xun said: "As long as the stone is there, the spark will never die." The laboring people of the Soviet Union will never tolerate the rule of anti-revolutionary revisionism. True proletarian revolutionary literature and art will one day roar out thunderously on the land of the Soviet Union. As Lu Xun said: "When the roaring literature appears, resistance is imminent."

We firmly believe that the revolutionary literature and art of the Soviet Union will be reborn and will serve as the trumpet call for the second October Revolution, inspiring the broad revolutionary people of the Soviet Union to drag out the Soviet revisionist leadership, along with their defenders of reactionary culture, and throw them to the ground! And the great army of the world proletarian cultural revolution will march forward triumphantly amidst the wails of the Soviet revisionist traitors!

    苏修把垃圾当宝贝
    上海戏剧学院“革命楼”战士
    在全世界革命人民热烈庆祝伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的欢呼声中，我国广大革命群众批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，进入一个新的高潮，取得了辉煌胜利。我国文艺战线的无产阶级革命派，同广大工农兵一道，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底批判受到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所支持的、以周扬等为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，把封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺砸个稀巴烂，把资产阶级文艺“权威”，批得体无完肤，“威风”扫地以尽！
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，也震惊了苏修反动文化的辩护士。他们疯狂地叫嚣：中国的文化大革命“实际上是否认文化”呀，使“文学艺术方面受到蹂躏”呀，戏剧改革“实际上是禁止中国人民所喜爱的戏剧形式”，“实际上使中国的文化生活瘫痪”、“毁灭”呀，等等。
    呸！无产阶级革命事业的叛徒——苏修反华好汉们，你们左一个“实际上”，右一个“实际上”，可是，为什么闭口不谈被我国无产阶级革命派所否定的，究竟是什么文化，是什么艺术？你们同骗子一样，有意回避这些根本问题，进行蒙混撞骗！
    伟大领袖毛主席早就指出：“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治。”“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    严峻的阶级斗争事实，苏联复辟资本主义的事实，使我们深深地懂得：封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的东西，你不打倒它，社会主义的东西就立不起来；文艺领域，无产阶级不去占领，就会被资产阶级占领。对于反革命修正主义的猖狂进攻，真正的无产阶级革命者，必须予以迎头痛击。我们必须把思想领域、文化艺术领域里由党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把持的权夺过来，彻底夺回来！
    “不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”在伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，都变成了旧世界的批判者。我们拿起笔，作刀枪，把封建主义、资本主义、修正主义那些乌七八糟的黑货，统统打倒，扔到历史的垃圾堆里去。
    在这场惊心动魄的阶级搏斗中，在我们无情地破坏反动文化的过程中，我们无产阶级革命派，也正在创造着人类历史上空前辉煌的无产阶级新文化。看吧！在我们伟大祖国的大地上，战斗的无产阶级新文化的百花，正在毛泽东思想的阳光下，茁壮地生长起来！革命京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》；革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》、《红色娘子军》；交响乐《沙家浜》等等，这些革命的京剧、芭蕾舞剧和交响音乐的伟大成功具有划时代的意义，可以毫不夸大地说，它们是有史以来在舞台上出现的最优秀最先进的代表作。这些光辉的成果，受到我国劳动人民的喜爱，也受到世界革命人民的热情赞扬。
    苏修叛徒对于我们无产阶级文化的丰硕成果硬装视而不见，却拚命地为在我国被打倒的反动文化鸣冤叫屈，嚎啕大哭。正如我国文化革命的先驱鲁迅所说：“帝国主义和我们，除了它的奴才之外，那一样利害不和我们正相反？我们的痈疽，是它们的宝贝”。
    看看苏联的今天，人们就更会明白这个真理。那些被我们否定、打倒的破烂货，今天正在修正主义专政下的苏联大泛滥；被革命人民唾弃的资本主义垃圾，他们正奉若掌上明珠。随手翻翻苏修的报刊，资本主义、修正主义的腐臭气味就会扑鼻而来。最近，有一个叫作谢利文斯基的“诗人”，竟公然出来鼓吹用“女性魔力”来“点缀生活”。真是无耻透顶！而那个早就臭名远扬的大叛徒肖洛霍夫，最近竟又被戴上“社会主义劳动英雄”的桂冠。具有极大讽刺意义的是，一个已经死掉的反动作家帕斯捷尔纳克，生前写过一部极为反动而且偷偷送到资本主义国家出版的小说《日瓦戈医生》，当初苏修集团慑于苏联人民的忿怒和压力，曾经不得不宣布他是“叛徒”和“革命的敌人”。但今天，苏修集团竟然要公开出版这部小说，也就是为他恢复名誉了！
    今天在苏联，充耳的，是西方爵士音乐如痴似狂的噪音；泛滥的，是美国和苏修集团炮制的大量诲淫诲盗的电影……。曾在十月革命和伟大卫国战争时期鼓舞苏联人民英勇战斗的种种革命文学作品，今天不是几乎已经完全湮灭了吗？当年，曾经鼓舞苏联人民起来斗争，起来打击法西斯侵略者的许多革命战斗歌曲，如今不是杳无声息了吗？
    苏修大灭无产阶级革命文艺，大兴资产阶级反动文艺，正是为他们在苏联全面复辟资本主义服务的，为他们推行修正主义政治路线服务的，为进一步巩固他们的资产阶级专政服务的。
    但是，苏修领导集团违背苏联人民意志，推行修正主义统治是绝不能长久的。革命的火种，在苏联人民的心中绝不会熄灭。正如鲁迅所说：“石在，火种是不会绝的。”苏联劳动人民决不会容忍反革命修正主义的统治，真正无产阶级的革命文艺，总有一天会在苏联大地上爆发出震天动地的吼声。也正如鲁迅所说：等到“怒吼的文学一出现，反抗就快到了”。
    我们坚信，苏联的革命文艺必定获得新生，而且将作为第二次十月革命的号角，鼓舞苏联广大的革命人民，把苏修领导集团，连同他们这批反动文化的辩护士，统统揪出来，打翻在地！而全世界无产阶级文化革命的大军，将在苏修叛徒们的悲鸣声中，浩浩荡荡地向前迈进！
