Chairman Mao says: "It is impossible to hope that imperialists and Chinese reactionaries will have a change of heart and turn back. The only way is to organize forces to struggle against them."

Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots bravely resist violence, blood spilled on the streets.

The British authorities in Hong Kong have intensified their bloody suppression and arrests against our compatriots.

Tens of thousands of people have engaged in a fierce struggle against the reactionary police and thugs.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 22nd, the British authorities in Hong Kong on the 21st once again intensified their brutal suppression in the central district of Hong Kong, deploying more than a thousand police officers and "riot control units" to carry out extremely violent and bloody suppression against our compatriots, causing our workers and compatriots to once again spill blood on the streets, with more than forty people being unjustly arrested.

The British authorities in Hong Kong have once again carried out bloody suppression against Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, which has aroused the great indignation of all the people in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets and engaged in an eight to nine-hour fierce struggle against the Hong Kong British police and "riot control units."

The situation shows that the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities dare to ignore the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the strong protests of the people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and are determined to make enemies of the 700 million Chinese people and the nearly four million compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

On the morning of the 21st, the tram workers in Hong Kong, who were enraged by the bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities, posted slogans on the trams at the North Point tram depot in an orderly manner, expressing their determination to fight against oppression to the end with all Hong Kong compatriots and their love for the great leader Chairman Mao. The insane Hong Kong British authorities dispatched a large number of "riot control units" to launch repeated attacks on the tram workers. These thugs raised their batons and gun butts viciously at the workers' heads and chests, many of whom were injured on the spot, with some bleeding profusely from their heads. The tram workers in Hong Kong, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, are the bravest and most steadfast hardliners. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "If someone does not provoke me, I will not provoke them; if someone provokes me, I will definitely provoke them back" and fought back bravely against the fascist thugs. The thugs were so frightened that they dropped a batch of batons, shields, and other weapons and fled in disarray.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots who study Chairman Mao's works in practice, despite the threats of the Hong Kong British authorities, continued to send representatives to the Hong Kong British "Government House" on the 21st to lodge the strongest protest. Starting from 10 a.m., batch after batch of representatives, wearing Chairman Mao's badges that shone with golden light, holding red revolutionary books "Quotations from Chairman Mao," marched forward to the "Government House" with their heads held high.

At around 1 p.m., a "reporter" from the American Broadcasting Company repeatedly provoked the crowds who were still fighting in front of the Garden Road, and even kicked the Hong Kong compatriots. At this time, the "riot control units" that had been ready for a long time launched a surprise attack on our compatriots. They crazily rushed along several main streets in Central, attacking the crowd. A child was surrounded and beaten by six or seven fascist thugs. Another brother and sister were beaten and arrested by thugs because the brother had a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on him. In North Point, the military police of the Hong Kong British authorities also intercepted and boarded trams, and whenever they saw passengers wearing Chairman Mao's badges, "Quotations from Chairman Mao" badges, and carrying red revolutionary books "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they would swing their batons and beat them. Just on one tram, nine Hong Kong Chinese compatriots were unjustly arrested.

"Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and wolves." The Hong Kong and Kowloon Chinese compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought are indomitable and unbreakable. Tens of thousands of people, with the heroic spirit of fighting to the death with the enemy, built barricades on the streets of Central and Sheung Wan, using stones and glass bottles to engage in a tit-for-tat struggle with the British imperialists. The enemy was surrounded by our compatriots and was in a sorry state. Slogans such as "Patriotism is not a crime, resisting violence is justified!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Long live the great unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" drowned out the sound of the enemy's wooden bullet guns, tear gas guns, and the enemy's howls.

Hong Kong Chinese compatriots who were beaten and injured were pushed onto the prison car, where they bravely shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" The enemy's handcuffs could only lock their hands, but they could not lock their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, nor could they lock their determination to fight against oppression to the end.

In the entire area where the Hong Kong British authorities carried out bloody suppression, many unions, schools, and shops used powerful loudspeakers to broadcast the "Letter to All Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots" and "Emergency Notice" issued by the Hong Kong and Kowloon People's Struggle Against British Oppression Committee on that day to the crowds fighting in the streets. The Chinese cargo ships moored at the shore also played songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and recordings of the "Three Articles" to express the determination of the 700 million people of the great socialist motherland to fully support the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots in fighting against oppression to the end, and to inspire the fighting spirit of the compatriots on the shore.

The flames of the people's resistance to violence burned fiercely throughout Hong Kong, growing more intense. By 6 p.m. that day, tens of thousands of compatriots were still firmly holding their positions in the struggle, closely monitoring the actions of the fascist thugs.

### 港九爱国同胞奋勇抗暴血洒街头  港英当局对我同胞变本加厉实行血腥镇压和逮捕  数万群众同反动警察和暴徒展开轰轰烈烈的斗争

    毛主席说：“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。
    港九爱国同胞奋勇抗暴血洒街头
    港英当局对我同胞变本加厉实行血腥镇压和逮捕
    数万群众同反动警察和暴徒展开轰轰烈烈的斗争
    据新华社香港二十二日电　香港英国当局在二十一日又变本加厉地在香港市中心区出动一千多名警察和“防暴队”，对我同胞进行极为残暴的血腥镇压，使我工人、同胞再次血洒街头，有四十多人横遭无理逮捕。
    港英当局又一次对香港中国同胞进行血腥镇压，激起全港九同胞的极大愤怒，数以万计的群众在街头同港英警察和“防暴队”进行了持续八、九个小时轰轰烈烈的斗争。
    情况表明，英国政府和港英当局竟然胆敢无视我国外交部的声明和港九各界同胞的强烈抗议，决心与七亿中国人民和港九近四百万同胞为敌。
    二十一日上午，被港英当局的血腥暴行激怒了的香港电车工人，有秩序地在北角电车总站的电车上张贴标语，表示坚决同全港同胞一道把反迫害斗争进行到底的意志，和对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱。丧心病狂的港英当局，竟然派出大批“防暴队”，多次向电车工人发动进攻。这些暴徒举起警棍、枪托凶恶地对着工人的头部、胸部猛打，许多工人当场被打伤，有的头部流血不止。有着反帝斗争光荣传统的香港电车工人，是最勇敢、最坚定的硬骨头，他们遵照毛主席关于“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人”的教导，对法西斯暴徒进行了英勇的自卫还击。暴徒们被吓得丢下一批警棍、藤牌等凶器，抱头鼠窜。
    在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的港九同胞，不顾港英当局的恐吓，二十一日继续派出代表前往港英“总督府”提出最强烈抗议。从上午十时开始，一批批代表胸前戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，高举红彤彤的革命宝书《毛主席语录》，昂首阔步向“总督府”前进。
    下午一时许，美国广播公司的“记者”一再向仍然在花园道坚持斗争的群众挑衅，并且用脚踢香港同胞。这时，早已准备好的“防暴队”向我同胞发起突袭，他们疯狂地沿着中环几条主要街道扑向人群，见人就打。有一个小孩竟被六七个法西斯暴徒围着拳打脚踢。另有兄妹二人，因哥哥身上带有《毛主席语录》，竟被暴徒围住毒打，并蛮横遭到逮捕。在北角，港英当局的军警还拦截并涌上电车，看到凡是戴有毛主席像章、毛主席语录章和身上有红色宝书《毛主席语录》的乘客，就挥舞警棍毒打，仅在一辆电车上就无理逮捕了九名香港中国同胞。
    “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九中国同胞是压不倒，打不垮的。数万群众怀着同敌人血战到底的英雄气概，在中环和上环的街道上筑起路障，用石头和玻璃瓶同港英帝国主义者展开了针锋相对的斗争。敌人陷入了我广大同胞的重重包围之中，狼狈不堪。“爱国无罪，抗暴有理！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“港九同胞爱国大团结万岁！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”等口号声淹没了暴徒的木弹枪声、催泪弹枪声和敌人的嗥叫声。
    被毒打受伤后硬推上囚车的香港中国同胞，在车上英勇不屈地高呼“毛主席万岁！”敌人的手铐只能锁住他们的双手，绝不能锁住他们对伟大领袖毛主席的赤胆忠心，绝不能锁住他们誓把反迫害斗争进行到底的坚强意志。
    在港英当局进行血腥镇压的整个地区，许多工会、学校、商店用强力的扩音器，向斗争中的群众广播了港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会当天发表的《告全港九同胞书》和《紧急通告》。停靠在岸边的我国货船，也播放毛主席语录歌和“老三篇”的朗诵唱片，表达了伟大社会主义祖国七亿人民全力支持港九同胞把反迫害斗争进行到底的决心，鼓舞着岸上同胞的斗志。
    群众的抗暴怒火在全香港熊熊地燃烧起来了，越烧越旺，当天下午六时，成千成万的同胞仍坚持在斗争的岗位上，密切注视着法西斯暴徒的行动。
