Hong Kong and Kowloon bus workers have all gone on strike starting today to strongly protest the fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities in the "May 22" massacre.

A joint statement issued by the Hong Kong and Kowloon bus workers said: "The persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities has escalated, and our struggle against persecution must also escalate. To protest the new bloody atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities, we have decided to halt all Hong Kong bus services starting May 23. We are determined to carry on the struggle against persecution to the end. We bus workers will follow Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Resolutely take a stand, be unafraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory.' We will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory."

At the same time, all 3,000 workers at the Taikoo Dockyard went on strike for one hour starting at 1 PM today, and students at the Po Chai Middle School in Hong Kong stopped classes for a day to strongly protest the unprecedented large-scale massacre carried out by the Hong Kong British authorities.
