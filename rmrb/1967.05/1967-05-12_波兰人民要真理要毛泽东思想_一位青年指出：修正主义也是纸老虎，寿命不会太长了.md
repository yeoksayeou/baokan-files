The Polish people love Chairman Mao and his works. With the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, in Poland, the revolutionary people of Poland are studying Chairman Mao's works more widely and deeply.

A university student (whose father is an anti-fascist veteran) obtained a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read it voraciously. He selected many aphorisms to study and memorize repeatedly. He insists on reading the quotations every day and strives to apply them in practice. Now, he can recite many passages. He loves Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought immensely. He told others: "Comrade Mao Zedong is not only the leader of the Chinese people but also the leader of all the people of the world. China has achieved great success in all aspects because it has Mao Zedong Thought." "The Chinese people are great because they have Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon. Every revolutionary youth seeking truth must read Chairman Mao's works!" "Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also in our hearts." After reading Chairman Mao's words, "The world is yours, it also belongs to us, but in the end, it is yours," he excitedly said: "That's right! A truly socialist Poland will be built by our generation."

A young person told a Chinese comrade that although some people are trying every means to shrink and limit the influence of great Mao Zedong Thought, the tide of the Polish people loving Chairman Mao and his works, and wanting revolution, is unstoppable. He said: "I am seriously studying Chairman Mao's thesis that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." "Revisionism is also a paper tiger. It will exist for a period, but it seems its lifespan will not be long."

A teacher said: "Chairman Mao has opened a path for the Chinese people and established a foundation. China can develop rapidly because it relies on Mao Zedong Thought." When talking about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, he said: "Everyone who cares about China is watching this cultural revolution. The Chinese revolution is thorough."

A woman said: "In transforming old ideas, the Chinese people have set an example for us. To raise the consciousness of the people quickly, we must have a great leader like Mao Zedong. I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works well."

    波兰人民要真理要毛泽东思想
    一位青年指出：修正主义也是纸老虎，寿命不会太长了
    据新华社华沙电　波兰广大革命人民无比热爱毛主席和毛主席著作。随着当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想在波兰的传播，波兰革命人民学习毛主席著作的活动更加广泛深入。
    一位大学生（他的父亲是反法西斯老战士）得到一本《毛主席语录》后，如饥似渴地通读了一遍，然后精选许多警句反复钻研并背诵。他坚持每天读语录，并且力求运用到实践中去。现在，他已会背诵许多段语录。他无比热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想，他对人说：“毛泽东同志不仅是中国人民的领袖，也是全世界人民的领袖。中国之所以能够在各方面取得伟大的成就，就是因为有了毛泽东思想。”“中国人民所以是伟大的人民，是因为有毛泽东思想作为武器。每个革命青年寻求真理，就必须读毛主席著作！”“毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是我们心中的红太阳。”他读了毛主席的“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的”这段语录后，兴奋地说：“说得对！真正社会主义的波兰要靠我们这一代去建造。”
    一位青年告诉中国同志说，尽管有人千方百计地想缩小、限制伟大的毛泽东思想的影响，但是，波兰人民热爱毛主席和毛主席著作、要革命的洪流是阻挡不住的。他说：“我正在认真学习毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断。”“修正主义也是纸老虎，它会存在一个时期，但看来寿命也不会太长。”
    一位教师说：“毛主席给中国人民开辟了航道，打下了江山。中国之所以能够突飞猛进地向前发展，就是依靠毛泽东思想。”他在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时说：“所有关心中国的人都在注视着这场文化大革命。中国的革命是彻底的。”
    一位妇女说：“改造旧思想方面，中国人民给我们树立了一个榜样。要人民的觉悟迅速提高，必须有象毛泽东这样的伟大领袖来领导。我一定要好好学习毛主席著作。”
