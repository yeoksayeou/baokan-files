As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters its decisive stage, commemorating the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I am deeply moved. Reflecting on the journey led by Comrade Jiang Qing in revolutionizing Peking Opera, I deeply feel that "Talks" is an ever-shining beacon for the proletarian literary and artistic front, guiding us through the struggles between the two classes and two lines, from victory to victory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first and foremost for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for them and used by them." However, over the past 17 years since the founding of the nation, the former Propaganda Department, the former Ministry of Culture, the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and their ultimate backer, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, have stubbornly pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, resisting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line. They have peddled revisionist "art for all the people," vehemently opposing the correct direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. They have fervently advocated feudalism and capitalism, allowing the lords, ladies, young masters, and young misses to continue ruling the stage. They deliberately distorted and altered Chairman Mao's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," using various art forms to launch a frenzied attack on the Party. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party even personally intervened, extending his black hand into the China Peking Opera Company. During a reception with actors, he poisonously declared that "in the future, works like 'Mei Long Town,' 'Four Generals Visit the Mother,' and 'The Second Entry into the Palace,' which have weak ideological content but high artistic value, can continue to be performed." Thus, anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weeds spread everywhere, and monsters and demons emerged in droves. The foul air of revisionism enveloped the entire Peking Opera stage and the entire literary and artistic world.

At this critical juncture, Comrade Jiang Qing stood up and engaged in a head-on struggle against this counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line. Comrade Jiang Qing raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading us to make revolution, rebel against old Peking Opera, and personally directing us in adapting and performing the revolutionary modern Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," sounding the charge for the revolution in Peking Opera.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." The willingness to perform modern plays does not mean that this question has been solved. In the creation of the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," there still existed complex and sharp class struggles. The question was whether to enthusiastically adapt and perform revolutionary modern plays or to adopt a passive, resistant, and even destructive attitude towards this new thing. Whether to stand on the proletarian side and enthusiastically sing the praises of the noble qualities of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, or to stand on the bourgeois side and distort and defame the image of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Whether to emphasize proletarian politics and let art serve politics, or to emphasize art one-sidedly and use art to cancel out or replace proletarian politics. Whether to present revolutionary struggles on stage as "higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal" than ordinary real life, or to adopt the so-called "realistic" attitude and use bourgeois naturalism to distort the theme of the play. Whether to dare to make a revolution, break through the old artistic forms, and create new, perfect artistic forms suitable for presenting new characters and a new world, or to adhere to old rules, cling to the so-called "tradition," and let new life conform to ancient artistic methods. In short, in the question of how to adapt and perform this play well and create a proletarian hero on stage, different class standpoints, different political attitudes, and different artistic views exist in irreconcilable struggle. The focus of the struggle is on how to highlight the towering image of Li Yuhe.

Comrade Jiang Qing instructed us to adapt the Shanghai Opera "The Red Lantern" into the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern." The script of "The Red Lantern" must highlight Li Yuhe, the hero of the working class. She said: Li Yuhe is not only a representative of the working class but also a representative of revolutionary martyrs and a Communist Party member. He is a great figure, a hero of the proletariat, and the focus should be on Li Yuhe, highlighting his towering image. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists, during the adaptation of "The Red Lantern," deceived those above and sealed off those below, secretly doing their own thing behind Comrade Jiang Qing's back. They did not highlight the heroic image of Li Yuhe but advocated "three generations sharing the limelight," even using the stage activities of negative characters to crowd out Li Yuhe. They changed the good parts of the Shanghai Opera "The Red Lantern" script and exaggerated the bad parts, even bringing in bad parts from other opera genres.

The scene "Escape from the Porridge Shed" in "The Red Lantern" is the only scene that depicts Li Yuhe's underground work and contact with the masses. This scene vividly shows Li Yuhe sharing joys and sorrows with the laboring masses, being closely connected with them, and displaying his fearlessness, bravery, and composure in front of the enemy. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists said this scene had "no play" and, under the pretext of "accommodating the characteristics of Peking Opera," cut the entire scene, making Li Yuhe recount the experience of escaping from the porridge shed in the fourth scene using narration. This actually made Li Yuhe praise himself to the old woman and Iron Flower, which contradicted the qualities of a Communist Party member and violated the discipline of underground workers. Comrade Jiang Qing criticized this and insisted on including the scene "Escape from the Porridge Shed." Under these circumstances, they had to add this scene. However, during the performance, they created countless obstacles, deliberately not performing this scene well, aiming to cut it again.

The adaptation of the scene "Dinner at Bird Mountain" also went through a struggle. According to Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, Li Yuhe should appear again after being tortured to better show Li Yuhe's unyielding heroism and spiritual power that overwhelms all decaying and reactionary forces. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists, under the pretext of "no play" for re-entering the stage, resisted Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions and delayed the change. On the contrary, they let the traitor Wang Lianju appear multiple times after his betrayal. Through Comrade Jiang Qing's persistent struggle, it was finally changed to the current form, allowing Li Yuhe to appear after being tortured in the posture of a judge, condemning Bird Mountain, and showing Li Yuhe's heroic nature of "making me bow my head is difficult."

Comrade Jiang Qing instructed that in the scene "Struggle at the Execution Ground," a long singing part should be arranged for Li Yuhe, allowing him to fully express his revolutionary passion, sing about his revolutionary ideals, and his belief in the victory of the revolution. Through Li Yuhe's singing, it shows that Li Yuhe, after being tortured, has an even firmer will. Although he knows that he is about to be killed by the enemy, he is fearless and unyielding. As he walks to the execution ground, he proudly sings:

	The red flag of revolution is raised high,
	The flames of anti-Japanese resistance have spread,
	Enemies, see how long you can tyrannize.
	After the storm, all flowers will bloom,
	New China will shine like the morning sun,
	Then red flags will fly all over China,
	Thinking of this, my confidence increases and my will becomes firmer.

This deeply reveals Li Yuhe's spiritual world, showing Li Yuhe's revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, elevating the heroic image to the highest degree, and making the entire play reach its climax. According to the performance methods of Peking Opera, only through a complete and perfect singing melody can one express the feelings of revolutionaries, express the class feelings of Li Yuhe's three generations of family members, and show the sublime revolutionary ideals of a Communist Party member. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists said that Li Yuhe should not sing too much in this scene; otherwise, the play would become "lukewarm" and make the audience tired. They also peddled "humanism," using the exploitative class's mother-son affection to stimulate the audience and using the scene of Li Yuhe and his mother being tortured to exaggerate the horror of the struggle at the execution ground.

Chairman Mao teaches us that in artistic creation, we must achieve "the unity of politics and art, content and form, revolutionary political content, and as perfect as possible artistic form." Therefore, Comrade Jiang Qing asked us to use all beautiful things to create the image of Li Yuhe, the proletarian hero. That is, to use the most beautiful music, the best singing, the most upright performance actions, and the most important stage positions to present Li Yuhe, making this heroic image more prominent, perfect, and towering. However, during the performance, the counter-revolutionary revisionists went against Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions.

For example, in the first scene, they had Li Yuhe cover his face with a coat and walk onto the stage in a tense musical atmosphere. After coming on stage, he appeared tense, distorting the vigilance of an underground worker into timidity and cowardice. This way, Li Yuhe's appearance gave the audience a shabby feeling rather than a heroic image. They said this was the way to "grab the audience's attention from the beginning." Comrade Jiang Qing immediately proposed specific modifications after seeing this. Thus, it was changed to the current form, where Li Yuhe holds a red lantern and strides onto the stage, then walks to the front of the stage, facing the audience and observing the situation. This gives a sense of calmness and composure while also showing revolutionary vigilance. This way, Li Yuhe's appearance immediately gives the audience a feeling of a towering heroic image.

Again, in the fifth scene, after Li Yuhe returns home and finds something is wrong, they had Li Yuhe appear extremely tense, pacing back and forth on stage as if he had no idea what to do. Then, they exaggerated the scene of Li Yuhe's family's parting. They also arranged for Li Yuhe to secretly drink alcohol at the beginning of this scene, saying this was more lifelike and humorous, "in line with real life." Under Comrade Jiang Qing's strong opposition, they were forced to cut this scene. They changed the part from Li Yuhe returning home to being arrested to: Li Yuhe enters the door, sees the paper butterflies on the ground, knows something is wrong, immediately realizes he might be arrested, and gives the old woman instructions for the battle. During the parting, he has the old woman offer Li Yuhe a bowl of alcohol to boost his fighting spirit. This shows that Li Yuhe, in a critical moment, first thinks of the interests of the revolution and the work of the Party, showing the revolutionary spirit of Li Yuhe's three generations of family members, fighting for the revolution, and as long as there is one person, that person will continue the struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you are a bourgeois artist, you will not sing the praises of the proletariat but of the bourgeoisie; if you are a proletarian artist, you will not sing the praises of the bourgeoisie but of the proletariat and the laboring people: the two must be one of the two." In the process of adapting and performing the Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," the attitude towards Li Yuhe and whether the focus is on creating the heroic image of Li Yuhe is not an issue of artistic handling but an issue of standing on which side and serving whom. It is a question of supporting and executing or opposing and resisting Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line, and it is also a dividing line between proletarian artists and bourgeois artists. This is a fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines. In this struggle, Comrade Jiang Qing always raised high the red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, insisting on the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, leading us to break through the encirclement, overcome difficulties, and shatter the various plots and tricks of the counter-revolutionary revisionists, finally successfully adapting and performing the revolutionary modern Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," creating a towering proletarian heroic image on the Peking Opera stage.

The success of the revolutionary modern play "The Red Lantern" is a great victory for the revolution in Peking Opera, a great victory for Chairman Mao's "Talks," and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic line. The victory of the revolution in Peking Opera signifies that the most stubborn fortress has been captured, the ancient art of Peking Opera has gained new vitality, and a broad road has been opened for creating Peking Opera that the workers, peasants, and soldiers love. The Peking Opera stage has become a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought and singing the praises of the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

As a member of the team that performed the revolutionary Peking Opera "The Red Lantern," I received profound class education during the adaptation and performance process and attended a lively class on Mao Zedong Thought.

Looking back, every instruction from Comrade Jiang Qing embodied Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts. Comrade Jiang Qing is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a flag-bearer leading the way in the revolution of Peking Opera, and a model for us to learn from forever.

Comrade Jiang Qing said, "Eating the grain grown by peasants, wearing clothes woven by workers, living in houses built by workers, and having the People's Liberation Army guarding our national defense frontiers, but not portraying them, I ask, on which class stand do the artists stand? Where is the 'conscience' you often talk about?" Comrade Jiang Qing's teachings made me even more clear about the direction, understand the great significance of the revolution in Peking Opera, and realize that as an artist, I must sing the praises of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and create biographies of their heroic figures. Not singing the praises of the workers, peasants, and soldiers is a crime. Only literary and artistic works that sing the praises of the workers, peasants, and soldiers are truly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

To perform the workers, peasants, and soldiers well and create towering heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers and their heroic figures, humbly becoming their students. In the past, under the control of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, we have long been detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and our understanding of the workers, peasants, and soldiers is far from sufficient. Compared to the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we are even farther behind. Therefore, as an actor, performing the workers, peasants, and soldiers is not about lowering the requirements but raising them, not about reducing difficulties but increasing them. The task is extremely arduous. As socialist revolution and construction advance, heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers continue to emerge and become more numerous. I deeply feel that our ideological level and performance methods are far from meeting the requirements of the situation. We can only raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance along the path indicated by this brilliant work "Talks" to become a proletarian artist.

We perform not just for entertainment and leisure but for revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To defeat the enemy, we must first rely on the army with guns. But having only this kind of army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Each of us revolutionary actors is a soldier in this cultural army. Our highest mission is to spread Mao Zedong Thought through artistic forms, use Mao Zedong Thought to unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, annihilate the enemy, and promote the early victory of the communist cause. This is a highly honorable political mission. To accomplish this mission, we must first emphasize proletarian politics and make a revolution in our souls, achieving ideological transformation. It is impossible to imagine that an actor who puts "self" first offstage can perform a heroic figure who puts "public" first onstage. Performing is not about highlighting the actor but about highlighting the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the play. We must smash the bourgeois "star system" and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois individualist thoughts of fame and wealth. We must make the names of the workers, peasants, and soldiers famous, make the names of revolutionary modern plays famous, and make the name of Mao Zedong Thought famous, never making personal names famous.

Mao Zedong Thought is the only guiding ideology for us to perform revolutionary modern plays well. We must place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first position. We must regard the study of Chairman Mao's works as the top political task that is higher than everything, greater than everything, preceding everything, and heavier than everything. We must always use Mao Zedong Thought to transform ourselves and art, making more and better heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers appear on stage.

"Talks" is a magic weapon for our revolutionary people and a guide for developing revolutionary literature and art. On the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of this brilliant work, we must raise this great red banner even higher and advance bravely. Forever following Chairman Mao, being a revolutionary for life, doing revolution for life, and performing revolutionary modern plays for life. Let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate the literary and artistic world, illuminate all of China, and illuminate the world.

    塑造高大的无产阶级英雄形象
    钱浩梁
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入决战阶段的时候，纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，我的心情十分激动。回忆起江青同志带领我们进行京剧革命的战斗历程，我深深感到，《讲话》是无产阶级文艺战线的光焰无际的灯塔，是引导我们在两个阶级、两条路线的斗争中，从胜利走向胜利的方向盘。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”但是，建国十七年来，旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委以及他们的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线。他们大肆贩卖修正主义“全民文艺”的黑货，极力反对文艺为工农兵服务、文艺为无产阶级政治服务的正确方向，狂热地提倡封建主义和资本主义那一套，让老爷太太少爷小姐们继续统治戏剧舞台。他们故意歪曲和篡改毛主席“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，利用各种文艺形式，向党猖狂进攻。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，还亲自出马，把他的黑手伸进中国京剧院。他在一次接见演员时大放其毒，说什么“今后象《梅龙镇》、《四郎探母》、《二进宫》等思想性较差，艺术性较高的都可以继续上演”。于是，反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的毒草到处泛滥，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。修正主义的恶浊空气笼罩了整个京剧舞台，整个文艺界。
    在这个紧要关头，江青同志挺身而出，同这条反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行了针锋相对的斗争，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线。江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导我们闹革命，造旧京剧的反，亲自带领我们改编和排演革命现代京剧《红灯记》，吹响了京剧革命的进军号。
    毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”愿意排演现代戏，并不等于已经解决了这个问题。在京剧《红灯记》的创作过程中，仍然存在着复杂尖锐的阶级斗争。是满腔热情地改编和排演好革命现代戏，还是对待这一新事物采取消极抵制乃至抗拒破坏的态度。是站在无产阶级立场满腔热情地歌颂工农兵的高贵品质，还是站在资产阶级立场歪曲丑化工农兵的形象。是突出无产阶级政治，让艺术为政治服务，还是片面地强调艺术，用艺术来取消或代替无产阶级政治。是在舞台上把革命的斗争生活表现得“比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”，还是采取所谓“写真实”的态度，用资产阶级自然主义的手法去歪曲这出戏的主题思想。是敢于革命，突破旧艺术形式的框框，创造出新的、适合表现新的人物新的世界的、尽可能完美的艺术形式，还是墨守陈规，死抱着所谓“传统”不放，让崭新的生活去服从古老的艺术手法。总之，在对待如何改编好排演好这出戏，在舞台上塑造一个无产阶级英雄人物的根本问题上，不同的阶级立场，不同的政治态度，不同的艺术观点，存在着不可调和的斗争。斗争的焦点，集中在如何突出李玉和的高大形象这个问题上。
    江青同志指示，要根据沪剧《红灯记》来改编成京剧《红灯记》。《红灯记》剧本一定要突出李玉和这个工人阶级的英雄人物。她说：李玉和既是一个工人阶级的代表，又是一个革命先烈的代表，又是一个共产党员，他是一个伟大的人物，是无产阶级的英雄，应当把重点放在李玉和身上，突出李玉和的高大形象。可是，反革命修正主义分子，在改编《红灯记》的过程中，却对上欺骗，对下封锁，背着江青同志另搞一套。他们不去突出李玉和这个英雄形象，而是主张“三代人平分秋色”，甚至用反面人物的大量舞台活动来排挤李玉和。把沪剧《红灯记》剧本中好的东西改没了，不好的东西发挥了，甚至还把别的剧种不好的东西也搬来了。
    《粥棚脱险》这场戏，是《红灯记》中描写李玉和从事地下工作，同群众接触的仅有的一场戏。这场戏正面展示了李玉和与劳苦群众同甘苦、共命运，亲密无间的情景，表现了李玉和在敌人面前，脸不变色心不跳，机智勇敢，沉着老练。可是，反革命修正主义分子却说这场戏“没有戏”，以“照顾京剧特点”为借口，把整场戏砍掉，让李玉和在第四场戏中，用说唱的方式把粥棚脱险的经过追述出来。这实际上是让李玉和向老奶奶和铁梅，自己表扬自己，恰恰违背了一个共产党员的品质，违反了地下工作者的纪律。江青同志对此提出了批评，坚持一定要《粥棚脱险》这场戏。在这种情况下，他们才不得不加上这场戏。但是，在排演中，他们又百般刁难，故意不把这场戏排好，以达到再次砍掉的目的。
    《赴宴斗鸠山》这场戏的改编，也经过一场斗争。根据江青同志指示的精神，李玉和受刑后应再次出场，以便更好地表现出李玉和威武不屈的英雄气概和压倒一切腐朽反动势力的精神力量。但是，反革命修正主义分子却以再上场没“戏”为借口，抗拒江青同志的指示，迟迟不改。相反，他们却让王连举这个叛徒在叛变后多次出场。经过江青同志坚持斗争，才修改成现在的样子，让李玉和在受刑后以审判者的姿态痛斥鸠山，表现了李玉和“要我低头难上难”的英雄本色。
    江青同志指示，在《刑场斗争》一场，要为李玉和安排大段的唱，让他在这场戏中，充分抒发革命豪情，唱出他对革命的理想，对革命必胜的信念。通过李玉和这一段唱，表现出李玉和受了酷刑，意志更坚。虽然他知道自己就要被敌人杀害了，但他大义凛然，临死不惧。在走向刑场的时候，他高昂地唱：
    革命的红旗高举起，
    抗日的烽火已燎原，
    日寇，看你们横行霸道有几天。
    但等那风雨过百花吐艳，
    新中国似朝阳光照人间，
    那时候全中国红旗插遍，
    想到此信心增意志更坚。这样深刻地展示了李玉和的精神世界，表现出李玉和胸怀祖国、放眼世界的革命英雄主义的气概和革命乐观主义的精神，使英雄形象升华到最高度，使全剧达到最高潮。根据京剧的表现手法，只有通过成套的、完美的唱腔，才能一泻千里地倾诉出革命者的情怀，抒发出李玉和一家三代人用鲜血凝结起来的阶级感情，展示出一个共产党员崇高的革命理想。可是，反革命修正主义分子却胡说什么：李玉和在这场戏中，不宜唱得太多，唱多了，戏就“温”了，会使观众疲乏。他们还大肆贩卖“人性论”，用剥削阶级的母子之情来刺激观众，用酷刑拷打李玉和母子的场面，来极力渲染刑场斗争的恐怖。
    毛主席教导我们，在艺术创造中要做到“政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”。因此，江青同志要我们用一切美好的东西来塑造李玉和这个无产阶级英雄形象。就是说，要用最美的音乐，最好的唱腔，最挺拔的表演动作，最重要的舞台位置，来表现李玉和，使这个英雄形象更突出、更完美、更高大。可是，在排演过程中，反革命修正主义分子却违背江青同志这个指示。
    例如，在第一场戏里，他们让李玉和用大衣遮住脸，在紧张的音乐气氛中走上舞台。上台以后，神情紧张，把地下工作者的警惕性歪曲成胆怯心虚。这样，李玉和一出台，就给观众一种灰溜溜的感觉，而不是一个英俊的形象。他们胡说这样才能够“一开始就抓住观众”。江青同志看了以后，立即提出具体的修改意见。于是，才改排成现在这样，让李玉和手提红灯，健步上场，然后走到台前，面对观众，观察情况。给人一种安详、坦然的感觉，同时，又表现出革命的警惕性。这样，李玉和一亮相，就给观众一个高大的英雄形象的感觉。
    又如，在第五场戏里，李玉和回家后，发现出事了，他们让李玉和表现得异常紧张，在台上踱来踱去，好象没有主意了。然后，又大肆渲染李玉和一家生离死别的情景。他们还在这一场戏的开头，故意安排了李玉和偷酒喝的情节，说什么这样才挺有生活，挺有风趣，“符合生活真实”。在江青同志极力反对下，他们才被迫砍掉了这个情节。把李玉和回家到被捕那一段改排成：李玉和一进门，看见地上的纸蝴蝶，知道出事了，立即意识到可能被捕，便马上给老奶奶交代战斗任务。在壮别时，让老奶奶请李玉和喝一碗鼓舞斗志的酒。表现出李玉和在临危关头，首先想到的不是自己的安危，而是革命的利益、党的工作。表现出李玉和一家三代人为革命前赴后继，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续斗争下去的革命精神。
    毛主席教导我们：“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”在编演京剧《红灯记》过程中，对待李玉和采取什么态度，是不是把重点放在塑造李玉和这个英雄人物身上，这不是艺术处理问题，而是站在什么立场上，为谁服务的问题，是拥护、执行，还是反对、抗拒毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线的问题，也是区别无产阶级文艺家和资产阶级文艺家的分水岭。这是一场两个阶级、两条路线的激烈的斗争。在这场斗争中，江青同志一直高举毛泽东文艺思想的红旗，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向，带领我们冲破重围，克服困难，粉碎了反革命修正主义分子的种种阴谋诡计，终于编演成功了革命现代京剧《红灯记》，在京剧舞台上塑造出高大的无产阶级英雄形象。
    革命现代戏《红灯记》的成功，是京剧革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席《讲话》的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。京剧革命的胜利，标志京剧这个最顽固的堡垒被攻破了，古老的京剧艺术获得了新的生命力，为创造工农兵喜闻乐见的京剧艺术开辟了无限广阔的道路。京剧舞台变成了宣传毛泽东思想，歌颂工农兵的英雄人物的阵地。
    我作为排演革命京剧《红灯记》的一员，在编演过程中，受到了深刻的阶级教育，上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想教育课。
    回想起来，江青同志的每一指示，都体现了毛主席的光辉思想。江青同志是活学活用毛主席著作的典范，是在京剧革命的大道上，走在最前面的高举红旗的旗手，是我们永远学习的好榜样。
    江青同志说，“吃着农民种的粮食，穿着工人织造的衣服，住着工人盖的房子，人民解放军为我们警卫着国防前线，但是却不去表现他们，试问，艺术家站在什么阶级立场，你们常说的艺术家的‘良心’何在？”江青同志的教导，使我更加明确了方向，认识到京剧革命的重大意义，懂得了，作为一个文艺战士，必须歌颂工农兵，为工农兵的英雄人物立传。不歌颂工农兵，就是犯罪。只有歌颂工农兵的文艺作品，才是真正为工农兵服务的。
    要演好工农兵，要塑造出高大的工农兵的英雄形象，就必须向工农兵学习，向工农兵的英雄人物学习，甘当他们的小学生。过去，文艺界在反革命修正主义文艺黑线的控制下，我们长期脱离工农兵群众，对工农兵群众的了解是很不够的，和工农兵的英雄人物比较起来，差得更远。因此，作为一个演员来说，演工农兵，不是要求低了，而是要求更高了，不是困难少了，而是困难更多了。任务是非常艰巨的。社会主义革命和建设在向前发展，工农兵的英雄人物在不断涌现，而且越来越多。我深深感到，我们的思想水平和表演手法都远远不能适应形势的要求。我们只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着《讲话》这篇光辉著作所指引的道路前进，才能成为一个无产阶级的文艺战士。
    我们演戏，不是简单地给人娱乐、消遣，而是在干革命。毛主席教导我们：“我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”我们每一个革命演员，都是这支文化军队中的一名战士。我们的最高任务就是，通过文艺形式，传播毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想去团结人民，教育人民，打击敌人，消灭敌人，促进共产主义事业早日胜利。这是一个极为光荣的政治任务。我们要完成这个任务，首先必须突出无产阶级政治，在灵魂深处闹革命，实现思想革命化。不可能设想，在台下“私”字当头的演员，能够在台上演好“公”字当头的英雄人物。演戏，不是突出演员，而是突出剧中的工农兵英雄人物。我们要打碎资产阶级的“明星制”，彻底清除资产阶级个人主义的名利思想。我们要出工农兵的名，出革命现代戏的名，出毛泽东思想的名，永远不要出个人的名。
    毛泽东思想是我们演好革命现代戏的唯一的指导思想，我们必须把活学活用毛主席著作放在第一位。要把毛主席著作的学习看成高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的头等政治任务。要时刻用毛泽东思想来改造自己，改造文艺，让舞台上出现更多、更好的工农兵英雄形象。
    《讲话》是我们革命人民的法宝，是发展革命文艺的指南。在纪念这篇光辉著作发表二十五周年的时候，我们要更高地举起这面伟大红旗，奋勇前进。永远跟着毛主席，作一辈子革命人，干一辈子革命，演一辈子革命现代戏。让毛泽东思想的光辉永远照亮文艺界，照亮全中国，照亮全世界。
