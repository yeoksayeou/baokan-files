The historical experience of the proletarian revolution tells us that after the proletariat seizes power, this is only the first step of a long march of ten thousand li. The more important and arduous historical task is to defend and consolidate the power.

The overthrown class enemies will never accept their defeat. They are constantly plotting to restore their lost "paradise." Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never reconcile themselves to their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will try every day and every moment to restore capitalism in China." In the seventeen years since liberation, domestic and foreign class enemies have not only fought us militarily but also politically, economically, and culturally; they have not only fought us from the outside but also from the inside. Whether openly or secretly, their goal is to seize the seal of office from our hands.

To achieve this evil goal, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has consistently peddled the theories of "class reconciliation" and "class struggle extinction," opposing proletarian dictatorship. In 1956, he advocated that "the landlord class has been basically eliminated, the bourgeoisie has been basically eliminated," "counter-revolutionaries have also been basically eliminated," and "the contradictions between enemies and us have been basically resolved." In his multiple reprints and re-editions of the 50,000-word "Cultivation," there is not a single mention of real class struggle, not a word about proletarian dictatorship, and even the two original quotes from Lenin have been blatantly altered to remove any mention of proletarian dictatorship. This is clearly to meet the needs of U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries, as well as the needs of domestic landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to restore capitalism; they attempt to make us forget class struggle, abandon proletarian dictatorship, and hand over the proletarian power, won by the Chinese people with their blood and lives, to the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. This is something that will never happen, not in a thousand years, not in ten thousand years!

Chairman Mao teaches us that proletarian dictatorship "is something that the victorious people cannot do without for a moment, like clothes, food, oil, and grain. It is a good thing, a protective amulet, a family heirloom that must not be discarded until imperialism abroad and classes at home are thoroughly and completely eliminated." The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has deeply proven the great power of this amulet. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between restoration and anti-restoration. We, the People's Liberation Army, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, actively participate in this life-and-death struggle, and actively support the broad masses of the left, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary masses and crushing the arrogance of the class enemies. This has created favorable conditions for seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Without a strong proletarian dictatorship and a strong People's Liberation Army as a backing, such a great revolution would be impossible to carry out and impossible to win.

We, the revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the reddest hearts and the brightest eyes. We have long seen through the tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev. Our guns of the proletariat will not be snatched away by anyone. We must hold our guns tightly and be the most reliable pillars of proletarian dictatorship.

    无产阶级革命的历史经验告诉我们，无产阶级夺取了政权，只是万里长征走完了第一步，更重要、更艰巨的历史任务，是保卫政权和巩固政权。
    被推翻的阶级敌人，决不甘心他们的失败，他们每时每刻都在阴谋恢复已失去的“天堂”。我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”解放十七年来，国内外的阶级敌人不但从军事上来和我们斗，而且从政治上、经济上、文化上来和我们斗；不但从外部来和我们斗，而且从内部来和我们斗。明斗暗斗，都是为了要从我们手里夺去印把子。
    为了实现这一罪恶目的，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯地贩卖“阶级调和”论和“阶级斗争熄灭”论，反对无产阶级专政。一九五六年他就鼓吹“地主阶级早已消灭了，资产阶级也基本消灭了”，“反革命也算是基本上消灭了”，“敌我矛盾基本上解决了”。在他的多次重印和再版、洋洋五万言的《修养》中，没有一个地方谈到现实的阶级斗争，没有一句话谈到无产阶级专政，甚至连引用列宁的两段原话也明目张胆地把无产阶级专政剜掉了。这分明是为了适应美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的需要，适应国内地、富、反、坏、右复辟资本主义的需要；妄图使我们忘记阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级专政，把我国人民用鲜血和生命换来的无产阶级政权，拱手交给大地主、大资产阶级。这是一千个办不到，一万个办不到的！
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级专政，“对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，深刻地证明了这个法宝的伟大力量。这次无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场复辟和反复辟的你死我活的大斗争。我们人民解放军，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极地参加了这场你死我活的斗争，积极支持左派广大群众，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，为向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权创造了有利条件。象这样一场大革命，如果没有强大的无产阶级专政和强大的人民解放军作后盾，是不可能进行、不可能取胜的。
    我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，心最红，眼最亮。中国的赫鲁晓夫的那套把戏，我们早就看穿了，我们无产阶级的枪杆子谁也抢不去，谁也夺不走。我们一定要把枪杆子握得紧紧的，当好无产阶级专政最牢靠的柱石。
