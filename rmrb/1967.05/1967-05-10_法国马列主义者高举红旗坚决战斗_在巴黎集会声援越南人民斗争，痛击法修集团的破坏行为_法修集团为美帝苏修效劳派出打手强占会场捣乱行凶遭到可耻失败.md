French Marxist-Leninists Raise the Red Flag and Fight Resolutely

In Paris, a rally was held to support the Vietnamese people's struggle, and the destructive actions of the French revisionist group were resolutely countered. The French revisionist group, serving the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, sent thugs to seize the venue, cause trouble, and commit violence, but suffered a humiliating defeat.

New China News Agency, Paris, May 7th - The Paris Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninists) organized a mass rally on the evening of the 5th to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The French Communist Party's revisionist group shamelessly sent hooligans to disrupt and sabotage the meeting. However, the participants insisted on holding the meeting and angrily denounced the U.S. aggressors and their accomplices, the modern revisionists.

The rally was originally scheduled to be held in the "Mutual Aid Hall" on the evening of the 5th. The revisionist leadership of the French Communist Party had planned to send a group of thugs to seize the venue more than an hour before the meeting began, even before the participants arrived. These hooligans beat up unarmed French revolutionaries with clubs and iron bars. The editor-in-chief of the *Nouvel Humanité*, Roger Bégar, was injured, and a member of the Paris Executive Committee of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninists) (a metallurgical worker) was seriously injured. More than ten people were injured so severely that they had to be sent to the hospital for treatment.

These hooligans even crazily tore down the portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao that were hung on the stage; they tore down the portrait of Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the banners reading "Workers of the world, unite!" and "U.S. Nazis, get out of Vietnam!"; they tore up the *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and the Vietnamese books and magazines that were on display for sale, as well as the copy of the Vietnamese film *We Will Surely Win* that was to be shown.

Several hundred people who came to attend the meeting were blocked from entering the venue and had to stay on the stairs and in the corridors. These participants unanimously protested against the fascist violence of the French Communist Party's revisionists, raising their arms and shouting slogans such as "The U.S. is a murderer!" "The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam will win!" "Kosygin is an accomplice!" "Roger is a traitor!" "Down with revisionism!" for half an hour. Several hundred other participants who had gathered outside the main door on the street also joined in shouting slogans and singing the *Internationale*. Later, the people inside came out to the street and joined with those outside. Thus, a massive outdoor demonstration against U.S. imperialism and revisionism appeared in front of the "Mutual Aid Hall"; the slogans denouncing U.S. imperialism and revisionist accomplices echoed through the streets.

In the face of the angry crowd, the thugs hid inside for a long time and dared not come out. Finally, these hooligans, protected by a large number of police, fled in disgrace amidst the crowd's angry shouts of "Traitors selling out to Washington!"

Several members of the French Communist Party, who had been deceived by the revisionist leadership of the French Communist Party and thought they were going to the "Mutual Aid Hall" for a "discussion," tore up their party cards on the spot when they saw the savage behavior of the thugs sent by the French Communist Party's revisionist leadership, expressing their unwillingness to stay in a party led by revisionists.

The crowd then entered the venue and held the meeting. The representatives who spoke at the meeting denounced the fascist actions of the revisionists and expressed their determination to wage a more effective struggle to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. A leader of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninists) quoted Chairman Mao in his speech, saying: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing," "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." He said that today's incident once again clearly shows that the modern revisionists in various countries are allies of U.S. imperialism.

The indignant crowd spontaneously donated more than ten million old francs to support the Vietnamese people at the meeting. They placed the money on a large Vietnamese Democratic Republic flag that had been torn by the revisionists.

The French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninists) issued a statement on the 6th, strongly protesting the French Communist Party's revisionist group's deliberate sabotage of this mass rally to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The statement emphasized that the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninists) is not afraid of intimidation and threats and has decided to hold a more massive demonstration in the near future to support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    在巴黎集会声援越南人民斗争，痛击法修集团的破坏行为
    法修集团为美帝苏修效劳派出打手强占会场捣乱行凶遭到可耻失败
    新华社巴黎七日电  法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）巴黎地区委员会五日晚在这里组织支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的群众大会，法国共产党修正主义集团公然派遣暴徒无耻地进行捣乱破坏。但是会议参加者坚持举行会议，愤怒地谴责了美国侵略者及其帮凶现代修正主义者。
    这次大会原定五日晚在“互助大厅”举行。法共修正主义领导集团有计划地派出了一批打手，早在会议开始前一个多小时、当参加会议的群众还未来到之前就强占了会场。这批暴徒用木棒和铁棍毒打正在帮助布置会场的手无寸铁的法国革命者，《新人道报》总编辑勒纪·贝热龙被打伤，法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）巴黎区执行局委员（一位冶金工人）身受重伤。有十多人因为伤势较重，不得不送进医院治疗。
    这些暴徒甚至疯狂地撕毁了挂在主席台上的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席的像；撕毁了胡志明主席像以及写着“全世界无产者和被压迫民族联合起来”、“美国纳粹滚出越南”的横幅标语；撕毁了《毛主席语录》以及陈列在会场准备出售的越南出版的书刊和准备放映的越南电影《我们必胜》的拷贝。
    几百个前来参加会议的群众被他们拦阻未能进入会场，不得不停留在楼梯上和过道里。这些参加会议的人一致愤怒抗议法共修正主义者的法西斯暴行，激愤地举起手臂不断高呼“美国是杀人犯！”“越南南方民族解放阵线必胜！”“柯西金是帮凶！”“罗歇是叛徒！”“打倒修正主义！”等口号达半个小时之久。聚在大门外街道上的另外几百个前来参加会议的群众也同他们一起呼口号，唱《国际歌》。后来，室内的群众来到大街上同外面的群众汇合在一起。于是，“互助大厅”门前出现了一个声势浩大的反对美帝国主义、反对修正主义的露天示威；谴责美帝国主义和修正主义帮凶的口号声响彻大街。
    在愤怒的群众面前，打手们长久躲在里面不敢出来。最后，这些暴徒在大批警察的保护下，在群众愤怒痛斥“卖身投靠华盛顿的法奸！”的口号声中，狼狈逃窜。
    有几个法共党员，他们受了法共修正主义领导的骗，以为是到“互助大厅”去参加一次“讨论”；当他们看到法共修正主义领导派遣的暴徒的野蛮行径后，当场撕毁了自己的党证，表示不愿继续留在修正主义者领导的党内。
    群众接着进入会场，举行了会议。会上发言的代表痛斥了修正主义者的法西斯行径，表示将进行更加卓有成效的斗争来支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争。一位法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）领导人在讲话中引用毛主席的话说：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”，“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”他说，今天的事件又一次清楚地表明，各国现代修正主义者是美帝国主义的盟友。
    义愤填膺的群众在会上自发地捐献了十万多旧法朗支持越南人民。他们把钱放在一面被修正主义者撕破的巨大的越南民主共和国国旗上。
    法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）六日发表公报，强烈抗议法共修正主义集团蓄意破坏这次支持越南人民抗美救国斗争群众大会的卑鄙行径。公报强调指出，法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）不怕恫吓和威胁，决定不久将举行更加声势浩大的声援越南人民抗美救国斗争的示威。
