The U.S. imperialists, with the help of the Soviet revisionist leadership, are further adjusting their military deployments in Europe, withdrawing military forces, and escalating the aggression in Vietnam, while intensifying the suppression of national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

According to reports from Western news agencies, the defense ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) met in Paris on May 9. Based on an agreement with the Soviet revisionist leadership's "overall policy," they decided to modify their military plans, replacing the so-called "massive retaliation" principle with the "graduated response" principle. The meeting also decided to reduce the number of troops stationed in Western Europe from the originally planned 30 divisions to 20 divisions. Western news agencies described this as the "most significant military policy change" made by NATO in a decade.

NATO's decision to modify military plans is a further response to the betrayal policies pursued by the Soviet revisionist leadership at the Karlovy Vary meeting. In late April, after the European trade union conference issued a statement on "Striving for Peace and Security in Europe," the United States announced on May 2 that it would withdraw 35,000 troops from West Germany to bolster its forces in Vietnam. Now, the United States and its NATO allies have formulated a plan to further adjust military forces in Europe.

Meanwhile, the Johnson administration has repeatedly urged the Soviet revisionist leadership to take corresponding measures to withdraw troops from Europe to the East. On May 4, Rusk said: "If the Soviet Union and Eastern European communist countries decide to follow the example of the United States and reduce their troops in Europe," the United States "would be very interested." An article in the U.S. *Christian Science Monitor* on May 6 more blatantly advocated that the Soviet revisionists have reason to "reduce their military burden in the West" to deal with "hostile neighbors in the East."

It is clear that the U.S. and the Soviet Union are colluding to "stabilize" Europe, aiming to intensify their anti-communist, anti-people, counter-revolutionary, and anti-China conspiracies. This is an important part of the global counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

For years, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been engaged in dirty deals to realize this evil plan. In particular, over the past year, as U.S. imperialism has become increasingly frantic in escalating the war in Vietnam, the Soviet revisionist leadership has become increasingly tight in its collaboration. Consider the facts:

In late June 1966, U.S. imperialism took serious steps to escalate the war in Vietnam, bombing Hanoi and Haiphong. In early July, the Soviet revisionist leadership convened a meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Pact countries, proposing the establishment of a "European security system" and advocating for military détente in Europe. Subsequently, the United States began to gradually withdraw troops from Europe.

In early October 1966, Johnson delivered a speech on European policy, openly advocating for joint U.S.-Soviet actions to "gradually and evenly" reduce military forces in Europe, seeking to achieve a "stable military situation." In December 1966 and February 1967, Kosygin visited France and Britain, continuing his intense efforts to establish a "European security system."

In March 1967, Kosygin delivered an anti-China speech, falsely accusing China of being "another source of tension," and declaring that the Soviet Union would strengthen its military, providing a pretext for the eastward movement of U.S.-Soviet military forces.

Following this, the Soviet revisionists convened the European trade union conference, and the United States announced the withdrawal of troops from Europe in a series of specific actions. The statement issued by the Karlovy Vary black meeting on "Striving for Peace and Security in Europe" was, in essence, a document of betrayal by the Soviet revisionists and their followers to the people of Europe and the revolutionary people of the world.

For a long time, U.S. imperialism has controlled Western Europe and threatened Eastern Europe by placing the bulk of its overseas military forces in Europe. Now, at a critical moment when U.S. imperialism is being beaten to a standstill in the Vietnam War and is running around the world in exhaustion, the Soviet revisionist leadership is pushing for "European détente" to allow U.S. imperialism to withdraw troops and intensify the suppression of the revolutionary flames in Vietnam and Asia, Africa, and Latin America. This is a clear exposure of the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the revolutionary war of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary cause of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world.

Chairman Mao said, "The current situation in the world is one of the final struggle between the two great forces of revolution and counter-revolution." The revolutionary storms of the people of the world are fiercely sweeping away and destroying the entire old world. The collusion between the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism cannot save the old world from its doom. The traitorous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership will only make the revolutionary people of the world more aware of the unshakable truth that to oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism, and more closely unite to fight, sweeping the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, these two paper tigers, and all harmful elements into the dustbin of history.

### 苏修大搞“欧洲缓和”促使美帝兵力东移  北大西洋侵略集团决定修改军事计划大量削减驻欧军队  美报公然鼓吹苏修集团“减轻西线负担”对付东方“敌对的邻国”

    苏修大搞“欧洲缓和”促使美帝兵力东移
    北大西洋侵略集团决定修改军事计划大量削减驻欧军队
    美报公然鼓吹苏修集团“减轻西线负担”对付东方“敌对的邻国”
    本报记者述评　美帝国主义在苏联修正主义领导集团的帮助下，正在进一步调整它在欧洲的军事部署，抽调军事力量，扩大侵越战争，加紧镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动。
    据西方通讯社报道，北大西洋侵略集团国防部长九日在巴黎开会，根据对苏修领导集团“总的政策的一致同意的估计”，决定修改它的军事计划，用所谓“逐级反击”的原则来代替所谓“大规模报复”的原则。会议还决定把这个侵略集团的驻西欧部队从原定的三十个师减少到二十个师。西方通讯社说，这是北大西洋侵略集团十年来所作的“最具有重大意义的军事政策修改”。
    北大西洋侵略集团修改军事计划的决定，是美帝国主义对苏修领导集团在卡罗维发利会议上推行的叛卖政策的进一步呼应。四月下旬，欧洲工贼会议发表了“争取欧洲和平与安全”的声明之后，美国就在五月二日宣布要从西德抽调三万五千名驻军，扩充侵越战争的兵力。现在，美国又同它的北大西洋侵略集团的伙伴制定了进一步调整欧洲军事力量的计划。
    与此同时，约翰逊政府还一再公开地督促苏修领导集团作出从欧洲把军队东调的相应措施。腊斯克五月四日说：“如果苏联和东欧共产党国家决定效法美国，减少它们在欧洲的军队”，美国“将会非常感兴趣”。美国《基督教科学箴言报》六日发表的文章更露骨地鼓吹，苏修有理由“减轻它在西线的军事负担”，去对付东方“敌对的邻国”。
    事情很清楚，美苏这样一唱一和，合谋“稳定”欧洲，是为了加紧实行它们反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的罪恶阴谋。这是美苏反革命的全球大勾结的重要组成部分。
    几年来，美苏一直在为实现这个罪恶计划，进行着肮脏的交易。特别是最近一年来，美帝国主义越来越疯狂地扩大侵越战争，苏修领导集团也就越来越紧密地加以配合。请看事实：
    一九六六年六月底，美帝国主义在越南采取严重的战争“升级”步骤，悍然轰炸河内、海防。七月初，苏修领导集团召开华沙条约国家政治协商委员会会议，提出建立“欧洲安全体系”，实现欧洲军事缓和的主张。接着，美国就陆续把欧洲驻军东调。
    一九六六年十月初，约翰逊发表关于欧洲政策的演说，公开鼓吹美苏“共同采取行动”，“逐步地、均衡地”减少双方在欧洲的军事力量，以谋求“一种稳定的军事形势”。一九六六年十二月和一九六七年二月，柯西金先后访问法国和英国，继续为建立“欧洲安全体系”进行紧张的活动。
    一九六七年三月，柯西金发表反华演说，诬蔑中国成了“紧张局势的又一个源泉”，叫嚷苏联要加强军备，为美苏军事力量东移制造借口。
    随后，就是苏修召开欧洲工贼会议和美国宣布从欧洲抽调军队的一系列具体行动。卡罗维发利黑会发表的“争取欧洲和平与安全”的声明，实际上就是苏修及其追随者向美帝国主义出卖欧洲人民和世界革命人民的一纸契据。
    长期以来，美帝国主义为了控制西欧，威胁东欧，把它的海外军事力量的主要部分，放在欧洲。现在，正当美帝国主义在侵越战争中被打得焦头烂额、走投无路，在全世界疲于奔命的关键时刻，苏修领导集团却大搞“欧洲缓和”，以便让美帝国主义抽调兵力，加紧扑灭越南和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的反帝革命烈火。这是苏修领导集团出卖越南人民的革命战争，出卖亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民和全世界人民的革命事业的叛徒面目的大暴露。
    毛主席说：“现在世界上的局面，是革命和反革命两大势力作最后斗争的局面。”全世界人民的革命风暴正在猛烈地冲击着和摧毁着整个旧世界。苏修领导集团同美帝国主义加紧勾结，决不能挽救旧世界的灭亡。苏修领导集团的这种叛徒行径，只能使全世界革命人民更加认识到反帝必须反修这一颠扑不破的真理，更加紧密地团结起来，坚持斗争，把美帝和苏修这两只纸老虎和一切害人虫扫进历史的垃圾堆。
