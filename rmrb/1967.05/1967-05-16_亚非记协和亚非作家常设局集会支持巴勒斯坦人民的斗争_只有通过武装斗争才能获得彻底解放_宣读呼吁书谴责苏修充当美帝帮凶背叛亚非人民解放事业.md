The Asian-African Journalists Association and the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau held a rally in Beijing today to firmly support the struggle of the Palestinian people against U.S.-led imperialism and its lackey, Israel.

The meeting emphasized that the Asian-African Journalists Association and the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau have consistently supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people and will continue to fully and unconditionally support the Palestinian people in their armed struggle, the only correct and reliable path to the complete liberation of their homeland.

The meeting strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionist leadership for betraying the liberation cause of the Asian and African peoples, acting as a henchman for U.S. imperialism, and advocating the "Spirit of Tashkent" to urge the Palestinian and Arab peoples to "coexist peacefully" with Israel. The meeting pointed out that the betrayal by the Soviet revisionists has incited Israel to further invade Arab countries, further serving U.S. imperialism.

At today's rally, friends from various countries unanimously expressed their boundless love for Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world. The stage was adorned with a majestic statue of the great leader Chairman Mao in the center, with quotations from Chairman Mao on either side: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The entire venue was filled with a revolutionary atmosphere of unity and struggle among the peoples of various countries. Large banners were hung in the venue, with slogans written in Arabic, Chinese, and English: "Long live great Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great people of China!" "Long live great Chairman Mao!" "Long live the unity of Asian and African peoples against imperialism!" "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!" "Firmly support the struggle of the Palestinian people against U.S.-led imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Victory to the Palestinian people!"

Sudanese revolutionary writer and member of the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau, Kair, addressed the meeting. He said that the struggle of the Palestinian people against U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel, is just, and therefore has won the support of the peoples of various countries around the world. Today, we are holding this rally in great China, amidst the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist in the world, Chairman Mao. We are confident that the voice of this meeting will resonate around the world.

The head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing, Jalb, spoke first at the meeting. He pointed out that the Asian-African Journalists Association and the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau have actively supported the struggle of the Palestinian people, inspiring the Palestinian people to continue their struggle to smash Israel and its master, U.S.-led world imperialism and reactionaries.

Jalb said that what gives hope that the people's forces can defeat the forces of tyranny is that Beijing has become the base of the world revolutionary struggle. In their struggle for national liberation, the Palestinian people have received firm material and moral support from Beijing. I take this opportunity to express my respect and gratitude to the government of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Mao Zedong, for their active support for the struggle of the Palestinian people.

After introducing the Palestinian issue and the struggle of the Palestinian people, Jalb said that the Palestinian people now more than ever believe that the path of armed struggle for national liberation is the only way to liberate their homeland. Jalb said that the Palestinian people will continue their struggle to liberate their homeland.

Secretary-General of the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau, Senanayake, said in his speech that the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau has always supported the heroic struggle of the Palestinian Arab people against imperialism and Zionism, and supports their just and legitimate right to recover the occupied parts of Palestine. Senanayake condemned the collusion between Soviet modern revisionism and Israel.

Senanayake said that the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau reiterates its support for the Palestine Liberation Organization in leading the Palestinian Arab people to recover their seized lands through armed struggle. We believe that only people's war can liberate Palestine. The great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong pointed out: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." We believe that the Palestine Liberation Organization will execute this sacred duty of mobilizing the masses.

Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Charo, listed facts in his speech to condemn imperialism's plotting and use of Israel to carry out aggressive activities in the Arab region and the Asian-African region, pointing out that Israel is an aggressive tool of imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism.

Charo said, we firmly believe in the truth spoken by Chairman Mao, that "the socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system," "revolution will inevitably occur, whether sooner or later, and will inevitably be victorious," and that "from a fundamental, long-term, and strategic perspective, imperialism and all reactionaries must be seen as paper tigers." The truly powerful force does not belong to imperialism and reactionaries, "but to the people." Chairman Mao also said, "The enemy will not perish of itself." All true revolutionaries in the world must unite to defeat imperialism.

Syrian Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Abu Qus, spoke at the meeting, condemning the subversive activities of U.S. imperialism in collusion with British imperialism against Syria. He expressed support for the just struggle of the Palestinian people. He said that the oppressed peoples place their hopes on the Chinese people. Today's Beijing is the capital of armed revolution, and China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a support for the world revolution.

During the meeting, friends from various countries repeatedly raised slogans: "Firmly support the struggle of the Palestinian people!" "Long live the people's war!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and so on.

Attending today's rally were also the deputy head of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam stationed in China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, the representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand abroad, Paron Chulawon, the head of the delegation of the Malaysian National Liberation League stationed in China, Shalama, the leader of the American Black people, Robert Williams, the Lao friend Mrs. Kui Ning, writers and experts from Arab countries, Asia, and Africa stationed in Beijing, and other friends from various countries.

Attending the rally were also responsible persons from relevant departments in China, responsible persons from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, representatives of the revolutionary faction of the All-China Journalists Association and the Chinese Writers Association, as well as representatives from the Beijing Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards of colleges and universities, and Red Guards of secondary schools.

The meeting finally read out the joint appeal from the Asian-African Journalists Association and the Asian-African Writers Permanent Bureau to all revolutionary and progressive journalists and writers in Asia and Africa: "Firmly Support the Palestinian People in Liberating Their Homeland."

The appeal said that we unequivocally and firmly support and stand with the fighting Palestinian people. In the course of the struggle, the Palestinian people have achieved great victories in uniting and organizing their forces and in choosing the correct path of armed struggle to liberate their homeland.

The appeal said that among all the countries assisting the liberation struggle in the world, the People's Republic of China is at the forefront. The People's Republic of China has always provided support and assistance to the Palestinian people. Now, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is achieving one victory after another, which ensures that this great base of the world revolution in China will never change color. We are also more convinced than ever that its assistance and support for the people of Vietnam, the Palestinian people, and all other peoples struggling for liberation will be more numerous and effective than ever before.

The appeal said that the Soviet modern revisionists have betrayed the liberation cause of the Asian and African peoples and have become the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism.

The appeal said that our position as Asian-African journalists and writers is very clear. We have fully and unconditionally supported and will continue to support the struggle of the Palestinian people. We believe in Chairman Mao's words: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "Without an army of the people, there is nothing of the people," and Chairman Mao's judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Therefore, we also believe that the Palestinian people, as long as they rely on their own efforts and persist in armed struggle, will certainly and must completely defeat the enemy and liberate their homeland. The appeal said that we call on all revolutionary journalists and writers to use their pens as sharp weapons to thoroughly expose all the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and to expose the ugly face of Soviet modern revisionism's betrayal and continued betrayal of the Palestinian people, the Vietnamese people, and other peoples struggling for liberation.

    据新华社十五日讯  亚非新闻工作者协会和亚非作家常设局今天在北京举行集会，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗以色列的斗争。
    大会强调指出，亚非新闻工作者协会和亚非作家常设局一贯支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，今后仍将完全无条件地支持巴勒斯坦人民通过武装斗争这一唯一正确和可靠的道路，彻底解放他们的家园。
    大会强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团背叛亚非人民的解放事业，充当美帝国主义的帮凶，大肆宣扬“塔什干精神”，要巴勒斯坦人民、阿拉伯人民同以色列“和平共处”。大会指出，苏修的背叛行为，唆使以色列进一步侵略阿拉伯各国，是进一步为美帝国主义效劳。
    在今天的集会上，各国朋友一致表达了他们对全世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席无限热爱的感情。会场主席台正中屹立着伟大领袖毛主席的雄伟塑像，两旁挂着毛主席语录：“枪杆子里面出政权”，“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”整个会场上充满了各国人民团结战斗的革命气氛。会场上挂着巨幅标语，上面用阿拉伯文、中文、英文写着：“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的中国人民万岁！”“伟大的毛泽东主席万岁！”“亚非人民反帝团结万岁！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”“坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争！”“打倒苏修！”“巴勒斯坦人民必胜！”
    苏丹革命作家、亚非作家常设局成员凯尔在大会开始时致词。他说，巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的斗争是正义的，因此得到世界各国人民的支持。我们今天在伟大的中国，在世界上最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命胜利声中举行这个集会。我们深信，大会的声音将传遍全世界。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布在会上首先讲话。他指出，亚非记协和亚非作家常设局积极支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争，鼓舞了巴勒斯坦人民把粉碎以色列和它的主子——以美帝为首的世界帝国主义者和世界反动派的斗争进行到底。
    加尔布说，令人感到人民力量有希望战胜暴虐力量的是，北京已成了世界革命斗争的基地。巴勒斯坦人民在为争取祖国解放的斗争中，从北京得到了物质上的和道义上的坚决支持。我利用这个机会，向在伟大的领袖毛泽东主席领导下的中华人民共和国政府、中国共产党和中国人民，对巴勒斯坦人民斗争的积极支持，表示敬意和感谢。
    加尔布介绍了巴勒斯坦问题和巴勒斯坦人民的斗争情况以后说，巴勒斯坦人民现在比过去任何时候都更加相信，通过人民解放战争的武装斗争道路是争取祖国解放的唯一道路。加尔布说，巴勒斯坦人民将把解放祖国的斗争进行到底。
    亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克在讲话中说，亚非作家常设局始终支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的英勇斗争，并支持他们收复巴勒斯坦被占领的部分的正义和合法的权利。森纳那亚克谴责苏联现代修正主义和以色列勾结。
    森纳那亚克说，亚非作家常设局重申，支持巴勒斯坦解放组织领导巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民，通过武装斗争收复被夺去的土地的神圣而崇高的斗争。我们相信，只有人民战争才能解放巴勒斯坦。伟大的革命领袖毛泽东主席指出：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”我们相信，巴勒斯坦解放组织将为这个神圣的义务而执行动员群众这个崇高的任务。
    亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多在讲话中列举事实，谴责帝国主义策划并利用以色列在阿拉伯地区和亚非地区进行侵略活动，指出以色列是帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的侵略工具。
    查禾多说，我们深信毛主席所说的真理，即：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度”，“革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”以及他所说的，“从本质上看，从长期上看，从战略上看，必须如实地把帝国主义和一切反动派，都看成纸老虎。”真正强大的力量不是属于帝国主义和反动派，“而是属于人民。”毛主席还说，“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”全世界真正的革命者必须团结起来，打败帝国主义。
    亚非记协书记处叙利亚书记阿布库斯在会上发言，他谴责美帝国主义伙同英帝国主义对叙利亚进行颠覆活动。他表示支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争。他说，被压迫人民把希望寄托在中国人民身上。今日的北京是武装革命的首都，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是对世界革命的支持。
    在大会进行中，各国朋友们不断振臂高呼口号：“坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争！”“人民战争万岁！”“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等。

    参加集会的，还有中国各有关方面的负责人，北京市革命委员会的负责人，中华全国新闻工作者协会和中国作家协会无产阶级革命派代表，以及北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中等学校红代会的代表。
    会议最后宣读了亚非新闻工作者协会和亚非作家常设局致亚非所有革命和进步的记者和作家的联合呼吁书：《坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民解放他们的家园》。
    呼吁书说，我们对战斗的巴勒斯坦人民表示确定无疑的和坚决的支持和团结。在斗争的过程中，巴勒斯坦人民在团结、组织自己的队伍方面以及在选择武装斗争解放家园的正确道路方面，取得了很大的胜利。
    呼吁书说，在世界上所有援助解放斗争的国家中，中华人民共和国是遥居首位的。中华人民共和国一直给予巴勒斯坦人民以支持和援助。现在，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在取得一个又一个的胜利，这就保证了中国这个世界革命强大的基地将永不变色。我们也比过去更为坚信：它对越南人民、巴勒斯坦人民以及一切其他争取解放的人民的援助和支持将比以往更多、更有效。
    呼吁书说，苏联现代修正主义者背叛了亚非人民的解放事业，变成美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    呼吁书说，我们亚非新闻工作者和作家的立场是非常鲜明的。我们完全地无条件地支持了并将继续支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争。我们相信毛主席的这些话：“枪杆子里面出政权”，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”，以及毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断，因此我们也相信，巴勒斯坦人民只要自力更生和坚持武装斗争，一定能够而且必将彻底打败敌人和解放他们的家园。呼吁书说，我们号召所有的革命的新闻工作者和作家，用笔杆作为锐利的武器彻底揭露美帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋，揭露苏联现代修正主义背叛并将继续背叛巴勒斯坦人民、越南人民和其他争取解放的人民的丑恶面目。
