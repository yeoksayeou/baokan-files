How to treat revolutionary people and how to treat revolutionary mass movements is the touchstone that distinguishes revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries, and genuine revolutionaries from false ones. The film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," which was called a patriotic film by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, is in fact a thoroughly treacherous film. It stands completely on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and maliciously slanders the revolutionary masses while loyally serving the reactionary classes.

The Boxer Rebellion was a brilliant page in the history of China's modern revolution. With their courageous battles and heroic spirit, they proclaimed to the world: The Chinese people are not to be bullied! Our great leader Chairman Mao has fully affirmed the Boxer Rebellion with boundless revolutionary fervor. All revolutionaries have cheered: "Excellent!" However, the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" slanders the Boxer Rebellion as a "mob movement" of "neither human nor ghost, neither god nor demon." It distorts the Boxer peasant masses as "rebels" who practice sorcery and witchcraft, and as ignorant and disorderly mobs. In fact, the Boxers were a revolutionary mass fighting force against imperialism and feudalism. They were heroes who stood up to save the country in times of national crisis! The film also puts on the face of a running dog, shamelessly praising imperialism. It seems that it was not imperialism that invaded China, but the Boxers who ran into imperialist countries to wreak havoc. It seems that imperialist invasion was not determined by the nature of the invaders, but because the Boxer revolutionary masses "provoked" the invaders, thus "incurring the wrath of all." Look, to what extent this reactionary film confuses right and wrong, and reverses black and white!

Chairman Mao has long said: "The Chinese nation is not only known for its hard work and perseverance, but is also a nation that loves freedom and is rich in revolutionary traditions." However, the masses in the film are portrayed as "ignorant people," "obedient people," and born slaves. The film shamelessly slanders, saying: "The common people are the most obedient and also the easiest to satisfy." When the Guangxu Emperor fled, the common people chased after him to offer eggs and flatbreads, and sang praises, saying, "Amitabha, the Emperor is a good emperor, he helps us common people." They "all knelt down," "kneeling on both sides of the road," shouting "Long live the Emperor!" What is even more despicable is that the film portrays the Boxers, who have a high spirit of revolutionary rebellion, as the imperial guards and mercenaries of the feudal rulers, becoming the slaves and accomplices of Empress Dowager Cixi. This is a blatant distortion of history and a shameless slander of the revolutionary masses! Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people cannot tolerate the rule of dark forces; they have always used revolutionary means to overthrow and transform such rule." Revolutionary people have always regarded the reactionary ruling class as their mortal enemy and have never believed in any "good emperor." In our country's history, the oppressed classes have never stopped fighting against the exploiting classes. The Boxer revolutionary masses have always persisted in their struggle against imperialism and feudalism. As Chairman Mao said: "In Chinese feudal society, only the class struggle of the peasants, the peasant uprisings, and the peasant wars were the true driving force of historical development."

The reactionary authors of "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" have the same attitude towards the revolutionary masses as the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. Lenin once described revisionists: "They praise capitalism in every way, as if it showed strength, vitality, and adaptability—it is precisely these people who have helped the capitalists cultivate 'adaptability' and submissiveness among the working class in various countries, deceiving and dividing the working class." The number one capitalist-roader in the Party is exactly the kind of slave that the bourgeoisie needs. He desperately praises the exploiting class, saying that "exploitation" is the "immortal historical achievement" of capitalists, advocating exploitation and advocating the rich peasant economy. At the same time, he praises his "foreign masters." This number one capitalist-roader in the Party, who himself becomes a traitor, turns around and wants the revolutionary masses to also become slaves. He wants workers to be grateful to capitalists. "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" wants the people to kneel and offer eggs and flatbreads to the "Emperor," while the number one capitalist-roader in the Party wants the people to beg capitalists for exploitation: "Capitalist sir! I beg you to exploit me!" In his eyes, the broad revolutionary masses are ignorant "fools." He wants the revolutionary masses to forever be unenlightened "corpses," to be trampled and slaughtered at will. But where there is oppression, there will be resistance. The revolutionary masses do not buy his account! Lenin said well: "Millions of people have become citizens, soldiers, and no longer allow themselves to be treated as fools and black bones to be exploited at will."

How warmly Chairman Mao praises the revolutionary masses! He said: "The people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The people have limitless creativity." "The masses are the real heroes." He compares the revolutionary masses to an iron wall that no force can break, but the number one capitalist-roader in the Party has always looked down on and hated the revolutionary masses. From the past to this proletarian cultural revolution, he has always been contemptuous of and hostile to the revolutionary masses. He brings out the Nationalist Party's "tutelage" and sees himself as the "savior" and "Zhuge Liang," while treating the masses as "Liu Bei." He sits high above the masses, acting arrogantly, while wanting the masses to be the obedient "good people" in "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," as he puts it, "tame tools." He throws out the big poisonous weed "Cultivation," one of whose purposes is to try to make the broad Party member masses become blind followers of his bourgeois reactionary line, so that he can carry out a capitalist restoration.

Chairman Mao has always highly praised revolutionary mass movements. He enthusiastically cheered for the revolutionary masses' rebellious actions: "For thousands of years, it has always been said: oppression is right, exploitation is right, rebellion is wrong. Since Marxism came out, this old case has been overturned." But the number one capitalist-roader in the Party wants to overturn this old case again. He screams at the top of his lungs that exploitation is right, oppression is right, invasion is right, being a slave is right; but only revolution is guilty, rebellion is wrong! The face of a butcher who suppresses the revolutionary masses has been exposed nakedly in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution!

We still remember vividly: It was this number one capitalist-roader in the Party who colluded with another major capitalist-roader in the Party to concoct a bourgeois reactionary line. He treated the revolutionary youngsters as enemies, instructing a small clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party to suppress and strike the revolutionary masses, making them lose their freedom of action and revolutionary rights. He forcibly put the revolutionary masses on the track of his bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to strangle this vigorous cultural revolution. For a time, dark clouds pressed down on the city, and how many daring and bold revolutionary youngsters were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," "fake leftists, true rightists," "monsters and demons"; how many revolutionary youngsters who loved the Party and Chairman Mao were subjected to brutal suppression. A thriving proletarian cultural revolution became cold and desolate... At such a critical moment, the great leader Chairman Mao dispelled the layers of dark clouds and most resolutely supported the proletarian revolutionary forces. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad revolutionary masses smashed the counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line and won one victory after another in the proletarian cultural revolution.

The attitude of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party towards the revolutionary masses is completely in line with "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty," which is why they praise and protect "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" so much. Throughout history, all reactionary ruling classes and all old and new revisionists have always looked down on, feared, and suppressed revolutionary masses. Because their fundamental interests are completely opposed to those of the revolutionary masses, they are the mortal enemies of the revolutionary masses. In their eyes, the people are either "slaves" or "rebels." They fear the awakening of the revolutionary masses and implement a policy of keeping the people ignorant, so that the revolutionary masses will forever be their slaves. But once the revolutionary masses rise up in rebellion, they are called "rebels," and they will be brutally suppressed. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party is the representative of the bourgeoisie within the Party, a genuine revisionist! But all those who oppose the revolutionary people and suppress the revolutionary mass movements will meet a bad end! The three great enemies that "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" loyally served have already fallen, and the number one capitalist-roader in the Party will certainly meet a bad end!

    不许“大人物”诬蔑革命群众
    首都批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”联络委员会
    如何对待革命人民，如何对待革命群众运动，这是区分革命与反革命，真革命与假革命的试金石。被党内头号走资本主义道路当权派称为爱国主义影片，而实际上是彻底的卖国主义影片的《清宫秘史》，就是一部完全站在帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义方面，恣意诬蔑革命群众，为反动阶级效忠的影片。
    义和团运动，是中国近代革命史上光辉灿烂的一页。它以英勇的战斗、豪迈的气概，向全世界宣告了：中国人民不可侮！我们的伟大领袖毛主席以无限革命热情充分肯定了义和团这一伟大的革命群众运动。一切革命者也都为之欢呼：“好得很！”但是，反动影片《清宫秘史》却把义和团运动诬蔑为“非人非鬼，非神非妖”的“群氓”运动，把义和团农民群众歪曲为耍邪术妖法的“乱民”，愚昧无知的乌合之众。而事实是，义和团是一支反帝反封建的革命群众的战斗队伍，他们是在祖国危亡之时，挺身而出的救国英雄！影片还摆出一副洋奴的嘴脸，无耻地为帝国主义脸上贴金。似乎不是帝国主义入侵了中国，倒是义和团跑到了帝国主义国家内横行霸道；似乎帝国主义的入侵不是侵略者的本性所决定的，倒是因为义和团革命群众“刺激”了侵略者，因而“犯了众怒”。看，这部反动电影混淆是非，颠倒黑白到了何等程度！
    毛主席早就说过：“中华民族不但以刻苦耐劳著称于世，同时又是酷爱自由、富于革命传统的民族。”但是，影片中的群众，却成了“愚民”、“顺民”和天生的奴才。影片无耻诽谤说：“老百姓是最听话的，也是最容易满足的。”当光绪逃难时，老百姓竟然追来送鸡蛋、饽饽，而且大唱赞美诗，说什么：“阿弥陀佛，皇上是好皇帝，他是帮我们老百姓的。”他们“一齐跪下”，“夹道跪送”，高呼“皇上万岁！”尤其可恨的是，影片竟然把具有高度革命造反精神的义和团描写成是封建统治者的御林军和雇佣军，成了慈禧太后的奴才和同党。这是影片对历史的公然篡改，是对革命群众的无耻诬蔑！毛主席说：“中国人民是不能忍受黑暗势力的统治的，他们每次都用革命的手段达到推翻和改造这种统治的目的。”革命人民从来就把反动统治阶级看作死敌，根本不相信有什么“好皇帝”。在我国历史上，被剥削阶级从来没有停止过对剥削阶级的斗争，义和团革命群众也始终坚持了反帝反封建的斗争。正象毛主席所说的：“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”
    《清宫秘史》的反动作者对待革命群众的态度，也正是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的态度。列宁曾经这样描绘修正主义者：“他们百般颂扬，认为资本主义似乎表现出了力量、生命力和适应性，——正是他们这班人帮助过资本家在各国工人阶级中间培养‘适应性’和驯服性，愚弄和分化各国工人队伍。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这样一个资产阶级所需要的奴才。他拚命为剥削阶级贴金，说什么“剥削”是资本家“永垂不朽”的“历史功绩”，鼓吹剥削，鼓吹富农经济。同时又大肆吹捧他的“洋大人”。这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，自己甘当工贼，转过身来又要革命群众也去当奴才。他要工人向资本家感恩戴德。《清宫秘史》要人民向“皇上”跪送鸡蛋和饽饽，而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，则要人民向资本家乞求剥削：“资本家先生！我请求你剥削一下吧！”在他眼里，广大革命群众是无知的“愚民”。他要革命群众永远作不觉悟的“假死人”，任人蹂躏和宰割。但是，有压迫，就会有反抗，革命群众不买他的账！列宁说得好：“千百万人已经成了公民，成了战士，不再容许把他们当成愚民、黑骨头任意压榨了。”
    毛主席是多么热情洋溢地歌颂革命群众！他说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“人民群众有无限的创造力。”“群众是真正的英雄”。他把革命群众比作什么力量也打不破的“铜墙铁壁”，可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，从过去到这次无产阶级文化大革命，从来都是看不起革命群众，仇视革命群众的。他搬出国民党的“训政”那一套，把自己当作救苦救难的“救世主”和“诸葛亮”，而把群众当作“阿斗”。他高踞在群众之上，作威作福，而要群众做《清宫秘史》中那种奴性十足的“顺民”、“好百姓”，用他的话来说，就是“驯服工具”。他抛出《修养》这株大毒草，目的之一就是妄图使广大党员群众成为他的资产阶级反动路线的盲目追随者，以便他进行资本主义复辟。
    毛主席历来高度赞扬革命群众运动。他为革命群众的造反行动热烈欢呼：“几千年来总是说：压迫有理，剥削有理，造反无理。自从马克思主义出来，就把这个旧案翻过来了。”而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，妄想把这个旧案从新翻过去。他声嘶力竭地叫嚷剥削有理，压迫有理，侵略有理，当奴才有理；而独独革命有罪，造反无理！一个镇压革命群众的刽子手面目，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，赤裸裸地暴露出来了！
    我们记忆犹新：就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，勾结另一个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，炮制了一条资产阶级反动路线。他把革命小将视为仇敌，指使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派压制、打击革命群众，使他们失去了行动的自由，革命的权利。他把革命群众强行纳入他的资产阶级反动路线的轨道，企图扼杀这场轰轰烈烈的文化大革命。一时间，黑云压城，多少敢打敢冲的革命小将，被打成了“反革命分子”、“反党分子”、“假左派真右派”、“牛鬼蛇神”；多少对党对毛主席无限热爱的革命小将，遭到了残酷的镇压。一场蓬蓬勃勃的无产阶级文化大革命变得死气沉沉、冷冷清清……。就在这样的严重时刻，伟大的领袖毛主席拨开了层层乌云，最坚决地支持了无产阶级革命派。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，广大革命群众粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的反扑，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命的一个又一个胜利。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派对革命群众的态度，与《清宫秘史》完全出于一辙，这就难怪他们那样赞赏和保护《清宫秘史》了。自古以来，一切反动统治阶级，一切新老修正主义者，从来就是蔑视革命群众，害怕革命群众，镇压革命群众的。因为他们的根本利益和革命群众的根本利益是完全对立的，他们是革命群众的死敌。在这些人看来，人民群众若不是“奴才”，就是“乱民”。他们害怕革命群众的觉醒，于是实行愚民政策，让革命群众永远当他们的奴才。而革命群众一旦起来造反，就被骂成“乱民”，他们就要疯狂镇压。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是资产阶级在党内的代表人物，就是一个货真价实的修正主义者！但是，一切与革命人民为敌，镇压革命群众运动的人都没有好下场！《清宫秘史》为之效忠的三大敌人已经倒台，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也决没有什么好下场！
