The May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966 shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought and has epoch-making significance. It is Mao Zedong's new great development of Marxism-Leninism.

The international communist movement, after experiencing countless storms and twists and turns over a hundred years, has entered a completely new stage today. As early as the 1840s, the revolutionary leaders of the proletariat, Marx and Engels, with their fearless proletarian revolutionary spirit, bravely declared war on the entire capitalist old world. They published the Communist Manifesto, laying the theoretical foundation for scientific communism and preparing the theory for the proletarian liberation struggle. In 1917, under the leadership of the great revolutionary leader Lenin, the Russian proletariat completed the October Socialist Revolution, seized power by force, and established the first socialist state, pushing the international proletarian revolution to a new stage.

In the 1960s, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the international proletariat, Chairman Mao, summed up the experience of the communist movement, drew lessons from the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, solved the great issue of carrying out a socialist revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointed the way for the proletariat to transition to communism after seizing power, greatly enriched the treasury of Marxism-Leninism, and pushed the communist movement to a new stage.

The May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is the beacon of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and also the beacon illuminating the great road to communism.

Over the past year, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, in the great struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we have broken through numerous obstacles and achieved decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution. A handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois representatives have been exposed, and the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has also been exposed. We have seized their power, smashed their plot to restore capitalism, and defended the socialist homeland.

A sunken boat passes by a thousand sails, and a diseased tree is followed by ten thousand blossoms.

On the first anniversary of the birth of the great Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recalling the situation a year ago, the class struggle was so treacherous! The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, a figure like Khrushchev, was sleeping by our side, and the anti-Party conspirators and schemers like Peng Zhen were attempting to usurp the Party, the government, and the military.

A year later today, the surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have shattered the dream of restoring capitalism by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his gang! The revolutionary masses and revolutionary people across the country have exposed them to the light of day, thoroughly fought them down, and fought them to the end! They—the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—are the targets of the socialist revolution. A heart-pounding struggle for power has fully proven the absolute correctness, absolute wisdom, and absolute greatness of the Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. However, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines continues to be fierce. Although the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed, these fellows, like all reactionaries, will not voluntarily give up the positions they have occupied in the past or voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. Under the situation where the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is achieving victory after victory, they will inevitably fight to the death and make desperate struggles.

In places where the proletarian revolutionary masses have not yet seized power, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are bare-chested, openly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and doing their utmost to obstruct the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionary masses.

In places where the proletarian revolutionary masses have seized power and taken control, the class struggle is more concealed and more complex. The class enemies are exploiting loopholes within the revolutionary organizations, sowing discord, doing their utmost to destroy the great unity and alliance of the revolutionary masses, disrupting the revolutionary ranks, and trying to disguise their representatives to infiltrate the "three-in-one" teams.

Class struggle has always been fiercely waged around the issue of "power."

The proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary people must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, "to care about state affairs and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We must clearly realize that we are still at a critical moment of great struggle and must not become confused!

The Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is indeed very good, extremely good! It has extremely important and extremely profound great significance. It sounds the new charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary comrades, let us unite more closely, unite more closely, and mobilize more actively to launch a greater and deeper high tide of criticizing the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line, and a high tide of criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee headed by Peng Zhen, to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    坚决打倒彭真反革命修正主义集团
    北京市革命委员会常委  北航红旗负责人  韩爱晶
    中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉，具有划时代的伟大意义，是毛主席对马列主义的又一新的伟大发展。
    国际共产主义运动百年来，经过无数次惊涛骇浪、艰难曲折，到今天进入了一个完全崭新的阶段。早在十八世纪四十年代，无产阶级的革命导师马克思、恩格斯以其大无畏的无产阶级革命精神，勇敢地向整个资本主义旧世界宣战，发表了《共产党宣言》，奠定了科学共产主义的理论基础，为无产阶级解放斗争做了理论的准备。一九一七年俄国无产阶级在伟大革命导师列宁领导下，完成了十月社会主义革命，武装夺取政权，建立了第一个社会主义国家，把国际无产阶级革命推上了一个新阶段。
    二十世纪六十年代的今天，当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，国际无产阶级最杰出的导师毛主席，总结了共产主义运动的经验，吸取了苏联资本主义复辟的教训，亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行社会主义革命的大课题，为无产阶级夺取政权后向共产主义过渡指明了方向，大大丰富了马列主义的宝库，把共产主义运动推到一个更新的阶段。
    由毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的灯塔，也是照耀着向共产主义前进的大道的灯塔。
    一年以来，我们在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大搏斗中，冲破重重阻力，取得了文化大革命的决定性的胜利，一小撮反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物被揪出来了，我国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派也被揪出来了。我们夺了他们的权，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，保卫了社会主义的江山。
    沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春。
    在伟大的中共中央《通知》诞生一周年的今天，回溯一下一年前的情景，当时阶级斗争形势是多么险恶！党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派——赫鲁晓夫那样的人物正睡在我们的身旁，彭真之流的反党野心家、阴谋家妄图篡党、篡政、篡军。
    一年后的今天，汹涌澎湃的无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮冲破了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其一伙复辟资本主义的美梦！全国无产阶级革命派和革命人民把他们揪到了光天化日之下，把他们彻底斗倒、斗臭！他们——这些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，就是社会主义革命时期的革命对象。一场惊心动魄的夺权斗争，完全证明了中共中央《通知》的无比正确，无比英明，无比伟大。
    无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大胜利。但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争仍然在继续激烈地进行。虽然党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了，但是这些家伙如同一切反动派一样，是绝不肯自行放弃他们过去盘踞的阵地，自行退出历史舞台的。在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的形势下，他们必然要拚死一搏，作绝望的挣扎。
    在无产阶级革命派尚未夺权的地方，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派赤膊上阵，公开对抗毛主席的革命路线，极力阻止无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的进行。
    在无产阶级革命派已经夺权、掌权的地方，阶级斗争显得更加隐蔽、更加复杂。阶级敌人在革命组织间钻空子，挑拨离间，极力破坏革命派的大联合大团结，扰乱革命阵线，竭力把自己的代表人物乔装打扮，企图混进“三结合”队伍。
    阶级斗争，从来就是一刻不停地围绕着“权”字在激烈地进行。
    无产阶级革命派和革命群众要坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，“要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们必须清醒地意识到，现在仍然处在大决战的关键时刻，万万不可糊涂起来！
    中共中央的《通知》在现在发表真是好得很，好极了！它具有十分重要、十分深远的伟大意义。它为无产阶级文化大革命吹响了新的进军号。无产阶级革命派战友们，革命的同志们，让我们更紧密地联合起来，团结起来，最积极地动员起来，掀起更大规模地、更深入地批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线的高潮，掀起批判以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的高潮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
