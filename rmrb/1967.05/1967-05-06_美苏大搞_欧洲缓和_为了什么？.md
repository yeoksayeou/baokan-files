The U.S. imperialists, with the collusion of the Soviet revisionists, have recently decided to withdraw 35,000 troops from West Germany. This is yet another piece of evidence that the Soviet revisionist leadership is betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people. The following excerpts from Western newspapers and news agencies fully illustrate this point.

	“The United States and Britain hope that the Soviet Union will reduce its troops in Eastern Europe in the same way they plan to withdraw 40,000 troops from West Germany.

	“Diplomats say that there will soon be a call for the Soviets to make such a gesture.

	“Diplomatic sources say that the Soviets may respond positively because they need to transfer the troops currently stationed in Eastern Europe to strengthen their military forces along their unstable border with China.”

								—May 3, United Press International, London

	“It is not yet known whether the current ‘redeployment’ will lead to further strengthening. In the United States and Britain, there are also demands for a ‘substantial’ reduction of Anglo-American troops. But everything depends on the development of relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.”

						—May 4-5, French La Croix

	“President Johnson’s first phase of reopening relations with the Soviet Union has been quite successful. The Soviets have not only stopped their alleged unwillingness to negotiate with the Americans but are also pulling their chairs closer to the table, sharpening their pencils, and announcing that they are ready to meet.

	“The United States is prepared to place its relations with the Soviet Union above its relations with Germany; it is prepared to temporarily accept the status quo in Europe. If the Americans accept the status quo in Europe, the Soviets must also accept the status quo in Asia—that is, to resolve the Vietnam War on terms acceptable to the United States.”

						—March 11, British The Economist

	“Five months ago, in the Third Reconnaissance Squadron of the 14th Cavalry Regiment where James Anderson was stationed, only 14 out of the 48 officially appointed officers remained.

	“In the 7th Army, which has 150,000 personnel, such cases are not uncommon.

	“The reason for the shortage of officers and non-commissioned officers can be summed up in two words: Vietnam. A large number of experienced personnel have been transferred from the European theater to assume key positions in South Vietnam and in the training camps in the United States for soldiers to be sent to Vietnam.”

### 美苏大搞“欧洲缓和”为了什么？

    美苏大搞“欧洲缓和”为了什么？
    译者按：美帝国主义在苏修配合下最近决定从西德撤军三万五千人。这是苏修领导集团出卖越南人民利益的又一个罪证。下面摘译的西方报刊和通讯社的报道，充分说明了这一点。
    “美国和英国希望俄国跟它们打算从西德撤走四万军队的作法一样，也减少苏联在东欧的驻军。
    “外交人士说，不久将呼吁俄国人作出这种姿态。
    “外交界人士说，俄国人可能作出良好反应，因为他们需要把现在驻东欧的军队，去加强他们同中国的不平静的边界的军事力量。”
                                ——五月三日合众国际社伦敦电
    “还不知道目前的‘重新部署’是否将来会进一步加强。在美国和在英国一样，也要求‘大量’缩减英美军队。但一切都要取决于美国和苏联之间关系的发展。”
                        ——五月四、五日法国《十字架报》合刊
    “约翰逊总统设法重新打开和俄国的关系的第一阶段是干得不错的。……俄国人不仅已停止他们所谓的不愿同美国人谈判的说法，而且正在把椅子拉得更靠近桌子，削尖了铅笔，宣布要开会了。
    “美国准备把它同俄国的关系置于它同德国的关系之上；它准备暂时接受欧洲的现状。……如果美国人接受欧洲的现状，俄国人也必须接受亚洲的现状——也就是说根据美国所能接受的条件来解决越南战争。”
                         ——三月十一日英国《经济学家》杂志
    “五个月以前，詹姆斯·安德森中校所在的第十四骑兵团第三侦察中队中，经正式任命的总共四十八名军官中只有十四名了。
    “在有十五万人的第七军团里，这种事是屡见不鲜的。
    “军官和士官缺乏的原因可以归结为两个字：越南。大量有经验的人已从欧洲战场调走，以便在南越和在美国准备派往越南的士兵训练营中担任要职。”
                                  ——五月二日《纽约时报》
