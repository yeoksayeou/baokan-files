Albanian Comrades Highly Praise "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
The Need to Launch a Struggle Against Revisionism in the Ideological Realm

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, Dimitër Shuteriqi, Chairman of the Albanian Writers and Artists Association, who has been living and working in the Rubik Copper Mine for a long time, enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" for its immeasurable contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism aesthetics and proletarian literature and art.

On the 11th, Shuteriqi spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, saying, "The 'Talks' have special contemporary significance for establishing a literature and art that serves the class struggle at home and abroad and stands on the proletarian standpoint, and for the struggle against modern revisionism and its various forms in the realms of literary creation and aesthetic thought.

Shuteriqi said, "Twenty-five years ago, the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, delivered the 'Talks,' which is a great program and cornerstone for building a Chinese literature and art with communist ideology as its soul. The 'Talks' systematically expounded on the fundamental issues of Marxism-Leninism aesthetics and established the basic conditions for building and developing a literature and art with proletarian ideology as its soul. Therefore, it will forever retain its great value. Today, it is very instructive for Chinese socialist literature and art, for the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, and for socialist literature worldwide. We believe that the 'Talks' have made an immeasurable contribution to the development of Marxism-Leninism aesthetics and proletarian literature and art. It has been, is, and will be a precious aid to Albanian writers and artists.

Shuteriqi pointed out that we must wage a great struggle against any influence of the bourgeoisie and revisionism on our literature and art. The struggle against modern revisionism and all its forms in the realms of literary creation and aesthetic thought is a very arduous one. We must vigorously launch this struggle. Many writers and artists in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, as well as their followers around the world, have betrayed Marxism-Leninism. This shocking betrayal is often disguised very cleverly. This requires Marxist-Leninist literary and art workers in China, Albania, and other countries to be highly vigilant. Comrade Mao Zedong's great teachings have special contemporary significance in this regard. These teachings illuminate our path of struggle, calling on us to unite our ranks, prepare our ammunition, and charge towards the cunning enemy.

Recently returned from a visit to China, Lefter Bega, a member of the Albanian State Song and Dance Ensemble and a singer, said: "In China, we saw with our own eyes that Chinese literature and art, advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, are not only contributing to China's literary treasury but also to the world's literary treasury. For example, we saw the revolutionary modern ballet 'The White-Haired Girl' performed by the Shanghai City Dance School. This play vividly depicts the great achievements of Chinese literature and art under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great thoughts. The play is filled with the revolutionary spirit of the people and has a high level of artistic skill. Bega said: "Under the guidance of the great thoughts of Mao Zedong, Chinese literature and art will achieve even greater successes and better serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers."

### 阿尔巴尼亚同志高度赞颂《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》  必须开展思想领域的反修斗争

    阿尔巴尼亚同志高度赞颂《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
    必须开展思想领域的反修斗争
    据新华社地拉那电　下放在卢比克铜矿矿区长期体验生活的阿尔巴尼亚作家艺术家协会主席迪米特尔·舒特里基，热情赞扬毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》对马克思列宁主义美学和无产阶级文艺的发展作出了不可估量的贡献。
    舒特里基十一日就毛主席的这部光辉著作发表二十五周年对新华社记者发表谈话说，《讲话》对建立一个为国内和国际阶级斗争服务、站在无产阶级立场上的文艺，对反对文艺创作和美学思想领域中的现代修正主义及其变种的斗争，具有特别的现实意义。
    舒特里基说，二十五年前，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的《讲话》，是建设一个以共产主义思想为灵魂的中国文学和艺术的伟大纲领和巨大基石。《讲话》系统地阐述了马克思列宁主义美学的根本问题，它规定了建立和发展一个以无产阶级思想为灵魂的文艺的基本条件。因此它永远保持着它的伟大价值。今天，它对中国的社会主义文艺，对中国无产阶级文化大革命，对全世界的社会主义文学，都是非常有教益的。我们认为，《讲话》对马克思列宁主义美学和无产阶级文艺的发展作出了不可估量的贡献。它过去、现在和将来都是对阿尔巴尼亚作家和艺术家的宝贵的帮助。
    舒特里基指出，我们必须同资产阶级和修正主义对我们的文艺的任何影响进行巨大的斗争。反对文艺创作和美学思想领域中的现代修正主义及其一切变种，是一场十分艰巨的斗争。必须大力开展这场斗争。苏联和一些东欧国家为数不少的作家、艺术家以及他们在世界各地的追随者背叛了马克思列宁主义。这一骇人听闻的背叛，经常是伪装得极为巧妙的。这就要求中国、阿尔巴尼亚和其他国家的马克思列宁主义文艺工作者具有高度的警惕性。毛泽东同志的伟大学说在这方面具有特别的现实意义。这些学说照亮了我们斗争的道路，号召我们团结队伍，准备好弹药，冲向狡猾的敌人。
    不久前访问中国归来的阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团团员、歌唱家列弗特·贝绍说：我们在中国亲眼看到，遵循毛主席指出的方向前进的中国文学和艺术，不仅正在为中国的文艺宝库，而且也在为世界的文艺宝库作出贡献。比如，我们在中国看了上海市舞蹈学校演出的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，这个剧生动表现了在毛主席伟大思想指导下的中国文艺的伟大成就。这个舞剧充满着人民的革命精神，具有高度的艺术技巧。贝绍说：在伟大毛泽东思想指导下的中国文艺将取得更大的成就，更好地为广大工农兵群众服务。
