Title: Letter to the Yan'an Pingju Theatre After Watching "Forced onto the Beishan Mountain"

I have watched your performance, and you have done excellent work. I would like to express my gratitude to you and to pass on my thanks to the actors as well! History is created by the people, but in the old theater (and in all literature and art that is detached from the people), the people are reduced to mere dregs, while the stage is dominated by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being corrected by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, traditional drama will have a new life, and this is something to celebrate. Your beginning marks the beginning of a new era in the revolution of traditional drama. I am very pleased to think of this, and I hope that you will continue to write and perform more, creating a trend and spreading it throughout the country!

    看了《逼上梁山》以后写给延安平剧院的信
    （一九四四年一月九日）
    毛泽东
    看了你们的戏，你们做了很好的工作，我向你们致谢，并请代向演员同志们致谢！历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。你们这个开端将是旧剧革命的划时期的开端，我想到这一点就十分高兴，希望你们多编多演，蔚成风气，推向全国去！
