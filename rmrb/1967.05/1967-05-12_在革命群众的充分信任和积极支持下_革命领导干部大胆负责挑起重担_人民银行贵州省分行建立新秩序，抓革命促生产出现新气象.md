Under the full trust and active support of the revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres have boldly and responsibly taken on heavy responsibilities. The People's Bank of China, Guizhou Provincial Branch, has established a new order, and the movement to "grasp revolution and promote production" has shown a new and vibrant scene.

The revolutionary masses of the People's Bank of China, Guizhou Provincial Branch, have shown full political trust and active support for the revolutionary cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" leadership group. This has fully mobilized the revolutionary initiative and enthusiasm of these cadres. The work of the entire bank has quickly returned to normal, and the movement to "grasp revolution and promote production" has shown a thriving new scene.

With the help of military representatives, the revolutionary masses of this branch have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's policy on cadres. They have adopted a policy of distinguishing between different cases, clarifying a batch, releasing a batch, and combining a batch for those cadres who have made mistakes. Now, five leading cadres have joined the revolutionary committee. The majority of the deputy and above-level cadres in the entire bank have returned to their posts to "grasp revolution and promote production." This has achieved the goal of uniting the majority and striking down a handful.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of this branch take the "three-in-one combination" work seriously. Who should be combined with has been repeatedly discussed and fully consulted among various revolutionary combat organizations. Therefore, the revolutionary leading cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" have a certain degree of prestige among the revolutionary masses. However, due to the influence of anarchist tendencies and the fact that the transformation of cadres' ideological understanding and work style cannot be achieved overnight, after the establishment of the "three-in-one combination" leadership group, how to establish the prestige of revolutionary leading cadres, make them dare to take responsibility, and work boldly, remains an urgent problem to be solved.

The question of whether cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" can take on major leadership responsibilities has been a subject of heated debate among the revolutionary masses. Some people believe that revolutionary cadres can participate in the revolutionary committee as ordinary members but cannot take on major responsibilities. Others believe that they can handle production but not revolution. In short, some comrades still do not fully trust the revolutionary leading cadres who have already been combined.

After discovering these active thoughts, the military representative of this unit, together with the revolutionary comrades, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's statements on cadre policy and relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine, seeking answers from Chairman Mao's works and the party's policies. Through study and discussion, the revolutionary comrades realized that having reservations about revolutionary leading cadres, not making class analysis, is actually a manifestation of the anarchist tendency of universal suspicion, universal negation, and universal exclusion in a new environment. The editorials of the "Red Flag" magazine repeatedly emphasize that revolutionary leading cadres are the party's precious assets. They have richer experience in struggle, are more politically mature, and have stronger organizational capabilities. Revolutionary comrades should understand this in their minds and follow it in their actions; otherwise, it will not be beneficial to unite the majority of cadres, mobilize their revolutionary enthusiasm, and help the proletarian revolutionary masses to seize and use power well.

Based on the improved understanding, the revolutionary committee, according to the situation of the revolutionary leading cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination," divided their work. Some comrades are mainly responsible for grasping revolution, while others are mainly responsible for grasping production. The proletarian revolutionary masses have given them full trust and enthusiastic support, assigning them important tasks, and taking the lead in completing the tasks they assign. They pay attention to establishing and enhancing their leadership prestige at all times. For example, a deputy director, although only a member of the revolutionary committee, is often invited to attend the standing committee meetings because of his familiarity with banking business, and his opinions are highly respected.

The military representative and the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations of this branch believe that to fully play the role of revolutionary leading cadres, it is not only necessary to respect them and let them work freely, but more importantly, to help them politically and ideologically. Therefore, the military representative and the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations often study Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary leading cadres, exchange experiences and feelings of ideological transformation. When there are different opinions, they discuss them individually or bring them to meetings for discussion, and carry out active ideological struggles within the revolutionary committee. Initially, a few revolutionary leading cadres had the thought of fearing responsibility and fearing being "shellacked" again, so they worked timidly and pushed responsibilities either upwards or downwards. The military representative and revolutionary comrades analyzed this and believed that the main reason was that they still had selfish thoughts and could not correctly handle the revolutionary mass movement. Therefore, on the one hand, they criticized them seriously, pointing out that this was mainly due to the "self" factor; on the other hand, they helped them patiently, had many individual talks with them, and explained that as long as they worked wholeheartedly for the party and the people, even if they made mistakes in their work, the revolutionary masses would not negate them completely; encouraging them to stand firmly with the revolutionary masses, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, lead boldly, and take on heavy responsibilities. The serious yet enthusiastic help from the revolutionary masses moved them greatly, and they quickly dispelled their worries.

Now, the revolutionary leading cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" and other department-level cadres generally dare to lead, take responsibility, and work actively. A former deputy director, who had once implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and made serious mistakes, but because he had confessed early, gained the trust of the revolutionary masses, participated in the "three-in-one combination" leadership group, and took on the position of deputy director. Initially, when he was asked to give a rectification mobilization speech, he still had reservations. After studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he realized that this was mainly because he had not established the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly. Afterwards, not only did the revolutionary committee assign him the work he was responsible for, but he also actively proposed suggestions on how to carry out the movement and how to grasp the work. At that time, the revolutionary masses had just seized power, and the work was quite chaotic. This revolutionary leading cadre believed that this was mainly due to the lack of experience of the revolutionary masses, who had not yet learned to "play the piano." Therefore, he actively helped to adjust the organization, clarify the division of labor, and played a good role in promoting the movement and work.

The revolutionary leading cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" pay attention to learning from the military representatives and the representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations, learning to highlight Mao Zedong Thought and their revolutionary spirit; at the same time, they also care about the growth of the representatives of the revolutionary mass organizations and consciously take on the task of cultivating the younger generation. For example, soon after seizing power, in order to grasp the work of supporting spring plowing by the provincial bank, it was decided to hold a telephone conference. A revolutionary leading cadre in charge of production assigned this task to a young cadre, who was responsible for investigating and understanding the situation, drafting documents, and presiding over the meeting. This revolutionary leading cadre helped him come up with ideas and revised the documents for him. Because this young cadre had never presided over a telephone conference before, he was a bit afraid, so this revolutionary leading cadre encouraged him enthusiastically. As a result, this telephone conference was very successful.

Because the military representatives and the revolutionary mass organizations pay attention to giving full play to the core and backbone role of revolutionary leading cadres, the "three-in-one combination" leadership group of this branch has handled the relationship between old and new cadres well, basically achieving unity in thought and action. Therefore, this branch quickly overcame the problems of lax labor discipline and no one taking responsibility after seizing power, and established a new revolutionary order. The internal work of the organization to "grasp revolution and promote production" has achieved great success. In the past two months, this branch has also organized a large number of cadres to go to grassroots units, help with work, and promote the revolutionary great alliance of many grassroots units, pushing forward the work. The normal work order of the provincial banking system has been basically established, timely and effectively supporting spring plowing production.

    在革命群众的充分信任和积极支持下
    革命领导干部大胆负责挑起重担
    人民银行贵州省分行建立新秩序，抓革命促生产出现新气象
    本报讯　中国人民银行贵州省分行的无产阶级革命派，对于参加革命的“三结合”领导班子的革命领导干部，在政治上充分信任他们，在工作上积极支持他们，充分调动了这些干部的革命积极性和主动性。全行工作已经迅速走上正轨，“抓革命，促生产”出现了蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
    这个分行的革命派在驻军代表的帮助下，认真执行了毛主席的干部政策。他们对犯错误的干部采取区别对待的方针，弄清一批，解放一批，结合一批。现在，已有五名领导干部参加了革命委员会。全行正副处长以上的干部，绝大多数人已走上“抓革命，促生产”的岗位。这样就做到了团结大多数，打击一小撮。
    这个分行的无产阶级革命派，对革命的“三结合”的工作，是严肃认真的。应当结合谁，都经过各革命战斗组织反复酝酿，充分协商。因此，参加“三结合”的革命领导干部，在革命派中有一定的威信。但是，由于无政府主义思潮的影响，由于干部的思想认识和工作作风的转变也不是一下子可以做到的，因而在“三结合”的领导班子建立以后，怎样树立革命领导干部的威信，使他们勇于负责，大胆工作，仍然是一个急待解决的重要问题。
    参加“三结合”的革命领导干部，能不能担任主要领导工作？这个问题，在革命派内部曾经有过激烈的争论。有人认为：革命领导干部参加革命委员会，当一般委员可以，不能担任主要负责人。也有人认为：他们抓生产可以，不能抓革命。总之，有的同志对已经结合的革命领导干部，仍然不放心。
    发现这些活思想以后，这个单位的驻军代表，便和革命派的同志一起，反复学习毛主席有关干部政策的论述，学习《红旗》杂志的有关社论，从毛主席的著作中，从党的方针政策中找答案。经过学习讨论，革命派的同志认识到：对革命的领导干部有戒心，不作阶级分析，实际上还是一概怀疑、一概否定、一概排斥的无政府主义思潮在新的环境下的一种表现。《红旗》杂志的社论一再说明，革命的领导干部是党的宝贵财富，他们斗争经验比较丰富，政治上比较成熟，组织能力比较强。革命派同志在思想上理解了这一点，行动上就应当紧紧跟上；否则，就不利于团结干部的大多数，不利于调动他们的革命积极性，不利于无产阶级革命派掌好权和用好权。
    在提高认识的基础上，革命委员会根据参加“三结合”的革命领导干部的情况，对他们的工作进行了分工，有的同志主要负责抓革命，有的同志主要负责抓生产。无产阶级革命派，给予他们充分的信任和热情的支持，把一些重要的工作交给他们去做，对于他们布置的任务则带头去完成，处处注意树立和提高他们的领导威信。例如，一位副行长虽然只是革命委员会的委员，但是由于他熟悉银行业务，常委开会经常吸收他参加，对他的意见很尊重。
    这个分行的驻军代表和革命群众组织的负责人认为，要充分发挥革命领导干部的作用，不但要尊重他们，放手让他们工作，尤其重要的是从政治思想上帮助他们。因此，驻军代表和革命群众组织的负责人，经常同革命领导干部在一起学习毛主席著作，交流思想改造的经验和体会。遇有不同意见，就找他们个别交谈，或者提到会议上来讨论，在革命委员会内部开展积极的思想斗争。最初，有少数革命领导干部，有怕负责和怕再挨“炮轰”的思想，因而工作起来缩手缩脚，遇事不是往上推，就是往下推。驻军代表和革命派的同志，对此作了分析，认为主要是他们还有私心杂念，还不能正确对待革命的群众运动。因此，一方面对他们提出严肃的批评，指出这主要是“私”字在作怪；另一方面又耐心地对他们进行帮助，多次找他们个别谈话，向他们说明：只要他们忠心耿耿地为党和人民工作，那怕工作中出了缺点和错误，革命群众也决不会对他们一概否定；鼓励他们坚定地和革命派站在一起，相信群众，依靠群众，大胆领导，争挑重担。革命派既严肃又热情的帮助，使他们很受感动，很快解除了思想顾虑。
    现在，参加“三结合”的革命领导干部和其他处级干部，一般都能大胆领导，勇于负责，积极工作。原来的一位副行长，有一段时间执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了比较严重的错误，但是由于亮相较早，得到革命派的信任，参加了“三结合”的领导班子，而且担任副主任委员。最初，要他作整风动员报告，他还有顾虑。学习《为人民服务》以后，他认识到，这主要还是由于自己没有树立完全、彻底为人民服务的思想。此后，不但革命委员会分配他负责的工作，他都主动去做，而且对全行运动怎样搞法，工作怎样抓法，他都积极提出建议。当时革命派夺权不久，工作比较忙乱。这位革命领导干部认为，这主要是革命派缺乏经验，还没有学会“弹钢琴”。于是，他便积极主动地帮助调整了机构，明确了分工，对运动和工作的开展起了很好的作用。
    参加“三结合”的革命领导干部，很注意向驻军代表和革命群众组织的代表学习，学习他们突出毛泽东思想，学习他们的革命精神；同时也很关心革命群众组织代表的成长，自觉地把培养年青一代的任务担当起来。例如，夺权后不久，为了把全省银行支援春耕的工作抓起来，决定开一次电话会议。着重抓生产的一位革命领导干部，把这项任务交给一位青年干部，从调查了解情况，起草文件到主持会议，都由他负责。这位革命领导干部帮助他出主意，替他修改文件。由于这位青年干部从来没有主持过电话会议，心里有些害怕，这位革命领导干部就热情地鼓励他。结果，这次电话会议开得很好。
    由于驻军代表和革命群众组织注意发挥革命领导干部的核心和骨干作用，这个分行的“三结合”领导班子中新老干部的关系处理得好，基本上实现了领导核心思想上和行动上的一致。因此，这个分行在夺权后很快地克服了劳动纪律松懈、工作无人负责等不良现象，建立了革命的新秩序。机关内部“抓革命，促生产”取得了很大的成绩。两个月来，这个分行还先后组织大批干部到基层单位，帮助工作，促进了许多基层单位的革命大联合，推动了工作。全省银行系统的正常工作秩序已基本建立起来，及时地有力地支援了春耕生产。
