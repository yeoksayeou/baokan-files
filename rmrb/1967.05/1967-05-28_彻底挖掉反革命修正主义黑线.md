Mao Zedong's great documents guiding the Cultural Revolution are being published one after another in the newspapers. Today, we have read "On the Question of the Study of the 'Dream of the Red Chamber.'" We are filled with joy and excitement that is hard to describe.

Mao Zedong's "On the Question of the Study of the 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" is a document of great historical significance. Thirteen years ago, a great debate between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie took place over the study of the "Dream of the Red Chamber." Chairman Mao firmly supported the revolutionary "little people" and launched a fierce attack on the bourgeois "authorities." "On the Question of the Study of the 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" powerfully exposed the ugly faces of those who were fake communists and true representatives of the bourgeoisie.

At that time, with the support of the Khrushchev in China, counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and Feng Xuefeng, and right-wing bourgeois elements, used the "Literary Gazette" they controlled to praise bourgeois reactionary "authorities," protect the extremely reactionary idealism of the Hu Shi clique, and suppress and attack the new Marxist forces. Since 1953, the editorial department of the "Literary Gazette" had received many letters and articles from the masses, demanding the criticism of Yu Pingbo and his "Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber," and exposing the reactionary essence of this bourgeois "authority" and the poisonous weed he concocted. However, the editorial department of the "Literary Gazette" ignored these and instead published an article in the ninth issue of that year recommending Yu Pingbo's "Study of the Dream of the Dream of the Red Chamber," greatly praising the reactionary idealism of the bourgeoisie.

Our great leader Chairman Mao saw two articles written by two young league members criticizing Yu Pingbo's "Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber" in the publication "Literature, History, and Philosophy" of Shandong University and immediately paid great attention and support to them. Comrade Jiang Qing personally conveyed Chairman Mao's opinions on this revolutionary article to Zhou Yang and Feng Xuefeng and proposed to reprint it in the "People's Daily" to launch a struggle against bourgeois idealism. Zhou Yang and Feng Xuefeng, these counter-revolutionary revisionists, dared to resist Chairman Mao's instructions, using the excuse that "the article was written by a small person" and "the party newspaper is not a place for free debate," and only allowed the "Literary Gazette" to reprint it. Although the "Literary Gazette" reprinted it, it was actually still plotting to resist. In the editorial note, it not only did not mention the vigorous Marxist-Leninist critical spirit of the revolutionary article but also picked at it in every way, saying that "the author's views are obviously not thorough and not comprehensive," trying to obstruct the criticism of bourgeois idealism.

Zhou Yang and Feng Xuefeng, these counter-revolutionary revisionists, dared to resist Chairman Mao's instructions so brazenly because they had a big boss backing them up—the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. This Khrushchev in China, after the "Literary Gazette" and Zhou Yang, Feng Xuefeng, and the clique they controlled were severely criticized, immediately jumped out to defend them, saying that the mistakes of the "Literary Gazette" were merely "lacking in the spirit of self-criticism," protecting Zhou Yang, Feng Xuefeng, and their clique, and trying to strangle the great struggle against the bourgeois "authorities" and bourgeois idealism. Despite the various tricks played by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and his clique to resist the criticism of bourgeois reactionary idealism, under Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership, the proletarian revolutionaries launched a vigorous criticism of Yu Pingbo's "Study of the Dream of the Red Chamber" and Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts and achieved great victories. This is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

The practice of the struggle between the two lines in the ideological and cultural fields over the past seventeen years has proven that if the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideas and promote proletarian ideas is not carried out at any time in the field of literature and art under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the entire literary and artistic front may be seized by the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party. Once the literary and artistic front falls into their hands, it will become a bridgehead for them to sabotage the socialist economic base, sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration.

Now, the Khrushchev in China has been exposed, and the positions seized by the counter-revolutionary revisionists have been one by one taken back by the proletarian revolutionaries. We have smashed the old China Writers Association and other "Petofi Clubs" and are advancing in victory, criticizing the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. In these days full of victory and fighting spirit, studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work, we have once again received immense encouragement and education. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    彻底挖掉反革命修正主义黑线
    中国作家协会革命造反团
    毛主席指导文化革命的伟大文献，一篇连一篇地在报上发表。今天我们又读到了《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》。我们欢欣鼓舞的心情，难以形容。
    毛主席《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》，是一篇具有伟大历史意义的文件。十三年前，围绕着《红楼梦研究》问题，展开了解放后第二次无产阶级和资产阶级之间的思想大论战。毛主席坚决支持革命的“小人物”，向资产阶级“权威”发起猛烈的进攻，《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》，有力地揭露了那些假共产党员、真资产阶级代表人物的丑恶嘴脸。伟大领袖毛主席领导了这场大论战，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    当时，在中国的赫鲁晓夫的支持下，周扬、冯雪峰等反革命修正主义分子、资产阶级右派分子，利用他们所控制的《文艺报》，吹捧资产阶级反动“权威”，保护极端反动的胡适派唯心论，压制和打击马克思主义的新生力量。一九五三年以来，《文艺报》编辑部曾收到不少群众的来信来稿，要求批判俞平伯及其《红楼梦研究》，揭露了这个资产阶级“权威”和他所炮制的大毒草的反动实质。可是，《文艺报》编辑部对此置之不理，反而在这一年第九期上发表了一篇推荐俞平伯《红楼梦研究》的文章，大肆吹捧反动的资产阶级唯心主义。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在山东大学的刊物《文史哲》上看到了两个青年团员写的批判俞平伯《红楼梦研究》的文章，立即给予最大的重视和支持。江青同志亲自找周扬、冯雪峰等人传达了毛主席对这篇革命文章的意见，并提出将此文在《人民日报》上转载，以便开展对资产阶级唯心主义的斗争。周扬、冯雪峰等反革命修正主义分子，竟拒不贯彻执行毛主席的指示，以所谓“小人物的文章”、“党报不是自由辩论的场所”为借口，仅让《文艺报》转载了事。《文艺报》虽然转载了，实际上仍在阴谋抵制。他们在按语中不仅不提这篇革命文章生气勃勃的马克思列宁主义批判精神，反而对它百般挑剔，说什么“作者的意见显然还有不够周密和不够全面的地方”，力图阻挠对资产阶级唯心主义的批判。
    周扬、冯雪峰等反革命修正主义分子，所以敢于如此猖狂抗拒毛主席的指示，就是因为他们有后台大老板——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在给他们撑腰。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在周扬、冯雪峰和他们所控制的《文艺报》受到严厉批判之后，立刻亲自跳出来为之辩护，说什么《文艺报》的错误仅仅是“缺乏自我批评的精神”，保护周扬、冯雪峰一伙，妄图扼杀对资产阶级“权威”、对资产阶级唯心主义的大斗争。尽管党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙玩弄各种阴谋诡计，来抗拒对资产阶级反动唯心论的批判，在毛主席的英明领导下，无产阶级革命派对俞平伯《红楼梦研究》和胡适反动思想的批判，还是轰轰烈烈地展开了，并且取得了伟大胜利。这是毛泽东思想的胜利，毛主席革命文艺路线的胜利。
    十七年来思想文化战线上两条路线的斗争实践证明：在无产阶级专政的条件下，文艺领域如果不随时进行灭资兴无的斗争，整个文艺阵地就有可能被混进党内的资产阶级代表人物篡夺了去。文艺阵地一旦到了他们手里，就会成为他们破坏社会主义经济基础、破坏无产阶级专政、进行反革命复辟的桥头堡。
    现在，中国的赫鲁晓夫已经被揪出来了，被反革命修正主义分子窃踞了领导权的阵地又一个一个地夺回到无产阶级革命派手中来了。我们粉碎了旧中国作家协会等“裴多菲俱乐部”，正乘胜前进，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，开展本单位的斗、批、改。在这充满胜利喜悦和战斗激情的日子里，学习毛主席的这篇光辉著作，我们再次受到了无比巨大的鼓舞和教育。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
