The U.S. imperialists must repay the blood debt they owe to Chinese sailors. The Hong Kong Seamen's Union strongly protests the U.S. aircraft's disruption of international shipping and the injury of Chinese sailors. After the "De Fu" ship arrived at Huangpu Port, a protest meeting was held to denounce the crimes of U.S. imperialism.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 7th, a commercial ship named "De Fu" belonging to the Hong Kong Peninsula Shipping Company was bombed and strafed by U.S. imperialist aircraft while it was in Haiphong on April 25th. The ship was damaged, and six Hong Kong Chinese sailors were injured. This act of piracy by the U.S. imperialists, which disrupted international shipping, has sparked strong protests from people in the Hong Kong shipping industry and seamen.

The company's responsible person said to Hong Kong reporters on the 26th of April: "De Fu" cargo ship was engaged in normal shipping, facilitating international trade. The U.S. aircraft's indiscriminate bombing and strafing endangered normal transportation, threatening the safety of commercial shipping. People in the Hong Kong shipping industry are extremely indignant about this.

The Hong Kong Seamen's Union issued a protest statement on the 27th of April, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes.

The protest statement said, the U.S. imperialists' any barbaric acts will never intimidate seamen from various countries who stand for justice. Hong Kong Chinese seamen armed with Mao Zedong Thought are even more fearless of U.S. intimidation. We solemnly warn the U.S. aggressors that the blood debt you owe to Chinese sailors must be repaid.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Guangzhou on the 7th, the cargo ship "De Fu" of the Hong Kong Peninsula Shipping Company, which was bombed by U.S. aircraft, recently arrived at Huangpu Port in Guangzhou from Haiphong, Vietnam. On the evening of the 4th, Hong Kong Chinese sailors on this commercial ship held a protest meeting at Huangpu Port to denounce the U.S. imperialists' disruption of international shipping, indiscriminate bombing of commercial ships, and the injury of six Hong Kong Chinese sailors working on the "De Fu." More than 800 people, including crew members from Chinese, Vietnamese, and other British-flagged commercial ships docked at Huangpu Port, Red Guards, port and dock revolutionary cadres, and workers, participated in the meeting.

The seamen from various countries present held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," raising their fists and shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Victory to Vietnam, defeat to the U.S.!" A representative of the "De Fu" crew angrily denounced the U.S. imperialists' atrocities at the meeting. He said, the U.S. fascist behavior has aroused our utmost hatred for the American bandits. With the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the strong support of 700 million people in our motherland, we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight to the end with U.S. imperialism.

Two "De Fu" crew members who were injured by U.S. aircraft bombing denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialism at the meeting. They said, the U.S. imperialists' savage attacks will not shake our firm resolve to support the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation. Because we have the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao's leadership, and our minds are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To die for the people's interests is weightier than Mount Tai." In the future, we will redouble our efforts to study Chairman Mao's works, raise our class consciousness, and contribute our strength to support the Vietnamese people in defeating the U.S. aggressors.

A representative of the Vietnamese seamen angrily denounced the U.S. imperialists' heinous crimes in Vietnam at the meeting. He said, the more the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression is "escalated," the more they suffer heavy defeats. The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, with a high sense of internationalism, wholeheartedly support our people. This is the greatest encouragement to our people. Our people are extremely grateful to the Chinese people for this great internationalist spirit and to the Chinese Communist Party led by Chairman Mao.

Representatives of revolutionary workers at Huangpu Port, Red Guards, and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union spoke at the meeting, extending warm greetings to the class brothers on the "De Fu." They said, our country is undergoing an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party have been exposed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will make our socialist motherland even stronger. The great socialist motherland personally founded by Chairman Mao is the strongest backing for Chinese seamen working on foreign ships. When they spoke these words, the entire audience erupted in enthusiastic cheers: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

    美帝欠下中国海员的血债一定要偿还
    香港海员工会强烈抗议美机破坏国际航运杀伤中国海员
    “德福号”轮抵黄埔港后举行控诉大会愤怒声讨美帝罪行
    据新华社香港七日电  一艘属于香港半岛船公司的商船“德福号”，于四月二十五日在美帝国主义疯狂轰炸海防市的时候，在海防遭到了美国强盗飞机的滥炸和扫射，轮船受到损坏，船上六名香港中国海员被打伤。美帝这一破坏国际航运的强盗行为，激起了香港航运界人士和海员工人的强烈抗议。
    这家船公司的负责人四月二十六日对香港记者说：“德福号”货轮从事正常船运，沟通国际贸易，美国飞机对它滥加轰炸和扫射，危害正常运输，威胁商船航运安全，香港航运界人士对此表示十分愤慨。
    香港海员工会四月二十七日发表抗议书，愤怒谴责美帝国主义这一滔天罪行。
    抗议书说，美帝国主义的任何野蛮行为，绝不会吓倒坚持正义的各国海员。用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国海员，更不害怕美帝的恐吓。我们要严正警告美国侵略者，你们欠下中国海员的血债是一定要清偿的。
    据新华社广州七日电被美国强盗飞机炸伤的香港半岛船公司的货轮“德福号”，最近由越南海防港驶抵广州黄埔港。四日晚上，这艘商船上的香港中国海员，在黄埔港举行了控诉大会，愤怒声讨美帝国主义破坏国际航运，滥炸商船，杀伤在“德福号”工作的六名香港中国海员的滔天罪行。停泊在黄埔港的我国商船、越南民主共和国商船和其它悬挂英国旗的商船的船员，以及黄埔港的红卫兵革命小将，港口和码头的革命干部和工人，共八百多人参加了大会。
    到会的各国海员，高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“越南必胜，美帝必败！”“德福号”的船员代表在大会上愤怒地控诉了美帝国主义的暴行。他说，美帝这种法西斯行为，激起了我们对美国强盗十二万分的仇恨。我们有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，有祖国七亿人民做坚强后盾；我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同美帝国主义斗争到底。
    两名被美国强盗飞机炸伤的“德福号”船员在大会上控诉了美帝国主义的罪行。他们说，美帝国主义的野蛮袭击丝毫也动摇不了我们支援英雄的越南人民抗美救国斗争的坚强决心，因为我们有伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席的领导，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。毛主席教导我们：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”。我们今后要加倍努力学习毛主席著作，提高阶级觉悟，为支援越南人民打败美国侵略强盗贡献自己的力量。
    越南船员代表在会上愤怒地控诉美帝国主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行。他说，美帝国主义的侵略战争愈是“升级”，它就愈遭到惨重的失败。伟大的中国人民在伟大的领袖毛主席的领导下，以高度的国际主义精神，全心全意地支持我国人民，这是对我国人民最大的鼓舞。我国人民万分感谢中国人民这种伟大的国际主义精神，万分感谢以毛主席为首的中国共产党。
    黄埔港革命职工代表、红卫兵小将和中国海员工会广东省委员会的代表分别在会上讲话，对“德福号”的海员阶级兄弟致以亲切的慰问。他们说，我们的国家正在进行史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已经被揪出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。无产阶级文化大革命将使社会主义祖国更加强大。毛主席亲自缔造的伟大的社会主义祖国，是在外轮工作的中国籍海员最强大的靠山。在他们讲到这些话时，全场爆发出热烈的欢呼声：“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
