Chairman Mao pointed out in "We Must Take Seriously the Discussion of 'The Life of Wu Xun':" "In the eyes of many authors, the development of history is not about replacing the old with the new, but about making various efforts to preserve the old and prevent it from dying; it is not about using class struggle to overthrow the reactionary feudal rulers who should be overthrown, but about negating the class struggle of the oppressed people like Wu Xun, surrendering to the reactionary feudal rulers." Chairman Mao's words sharply exposed the counter-revolutionary essence of this film: it opposes class struggle, opposes the overthrow of the old feudal rulers, opposes revolution, and opposes the proletariat seizing political power.

Wu Xun, this landlord, usurer, and hooligan who went from "begging for education" to "lending money for education," has been praised by reactionary rulers for over a hundred years. The Qing dynasty awarded him with a plaque for "charity and benevolence," built a temple for him, and bestowed him with a yellow robe. They also had his biography recorded in the national history archives. The Beiyang warlords Yuan Shikai, Wu Peifu, and others wrote inscriptions to praise him. The Kuomintang reactionaries Chiang Kai-shek, Bai Chongxi, Dai Jitao, and the traitor Wang Jingwei sang his praises. Chiang Kai-shek even personally wrote the inscription "Unprecedented in his deeds, benevolent and righteous, truly without shame in his hardships and perseverance." During the period when the Japanese invaders occupied Shanghai, the puppet Hua Film Company made a film titled "The Benevolent Beggar" to propagate the "spirit of Wu Xun." All reactionary rulers needed servants and slaves like Wu Xun to obey and be slaughtered. The so-called "spirit of Wu Xun" is about not resisting, not struggling, and wholeheartedly serving the reactionary rulers as cattle and horses. It also propagates the opium of the spirit that exploitation and oppression are justified, to extinguish the revolutionary will of the people and consolidate reactionary rule.

The creation of this reactionary film began to brew in 1944, when the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan was heading towards victory. It was officially filmed in 1948, after the director was sent by the Kuomintang government to Hollywood to study filmmaking. The final script for filming was written in the United States, and the "dream sequence" was obviously influenced by the prevalent depiction of abnormal psychology in Hollywood films. The director of the film was actually an American-sponsored court writer, and the film was first produced by the fake Kuomintang Ministry of National Defense's China Film Production Company. However, the guns of the people's liberation war did not allow them to complete the film. In the winter of 1948, the private Kunlun Film Company, supported by the revisionist elements Xia Yan and Yang Hanqing, bought the script and the partially filmed negatives. The director was also brought into the Kunlun Company. After the script was revised by Xia Yan and Yu Ling, under Xia Yan's leadership, the unfinished business inherited from the Kuomintang reactionaries was completed, producing the big poisonous weed "The Life of Wu Xun" in two parts. In 1950, the film was approved for public screening after being reviewed by Zhou Yang, then deputy minister of the Ministry of Culture.

"The Life of Wu Xun" and "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" are two big poisonous weeds of films that propagate slavery and capitulationism, almost simultaneously produced around 1949, when great changes occurred in Chinese history. This is not accidental.

At that time, the proletariat was establishing a new proletarian dictatorship; while the old reactionary rulers were unwilling to perish and were ready to stage a comeback at any time. Where would the newly born proletarian dictatorship go? Would it follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly grasp the line of class struggle in the political, economic, and cultural fields, and carry out the socialist revolution to the end? Or would it follow the advocacy of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, cancel class struggle, and strive to preserve everything old to prevent it from dying, and surrender to the reactionary exploiting classes?

At this critical moment, the release of this reactionary film was to meet the needs of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeoisie and feudal forces, attempting to drag China back to capitalism and summon the spirits of the overthrown Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime.

The great victory achieved by Chairman Mao's personal initiation of the criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" more than ten years ago. However, the revisionist clique of Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others, who had long been entrenched in the literary and artistic circles and were directed and supported by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, stubbornly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and resisted the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun." They used every means to exonerate themselves, insisting that the problem with "The Life of Wu Xun" was a "problem of understanding." As soon as the criticism began, Zhou Yang wrote a secret letter to Yu Ling in Shanghai, instructing him "not to be hasty and rash," plotting to drag out this serious class struggle and go through the motions. From the second National Congress of Literature and Art in September 1953 to the Propaganda and Education Work Conference in 1962, Zhou Yang repeatedly shouted that the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" had "some deviations" and "some were too leftist." This was obviously a barefaced attack on our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao. How can this be tolerated!

Chairman Mao pointed out in 1954: "A film called patriotic but actually traitorous, 'The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty,' has not been criticized since its nationwide release. 'The Life of Wu Xun' has been criticized, but no lessons have been drawn." The large number of facts exposed during the Cultural Revolution have made us clearly understand that the fundamental reason why no lessons have been drawn is that the literary and artistic circles have been monopolized by the revisionist clique of Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others, who have been supported by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party for the past seventeen years.

We must draw the necessary lessons from the re-criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun," which is to never forget class struggle and never forget proletarian dictatorship. We must seize back the power in the literary and artistic circles that has been usurped by the revisionist elements Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and others, and thoroughly criticize them and the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party who support them, along with the revisionist black line in literature and art!

    从批判影片《武训传》中引出教训
    文化部机关革命战斗组织联络站
    毛主席在《应当重视〈武训传〉的讨论》中指出：“在许多作者看来，历史的发展不是以新事物代替旧事物，而是以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡；不是以阶级斗争去推翻应当推翻的反动的封建统治者，而是象武训那样否定被压迫人民的阶级斗争，向反动的封建统治者投降。”毛主席一针见血地指出了这部影片的反革命实质是不要阶级斗争，不要推翻旧的封建统治者，反对革命，反对无产阶级夺取政权。
    武训，这个从“行乞兴学”到“放债兴学”的大地主、大债主、大流氓，一百多年来，一直受到反动统治者的颂扬。清朝朝廷给他“乐善好施”旌奖，为他挂匾、修祠堂，黄马褂加身，并宣付国史馆立传。北洋军阀段祺瑞、吴佩孚等人为他题词褒扬。国民党反动派蒋介石、白崇禧、戴季陶和汉奸汪精卫之流为之歌颂传赞，蒋介石还亲自为他题书“独行空前，仁孚义协，允无愧于坚苦卓绝”的赞词。日本侵略者占领上海时期，伪华影公司曾为他摄制了一部名为《义丐》的影片，大事宣扬“武训精神”。一切反动统治者为了巩固政权，都需要象武训这样的顺臣和奴才，俯首听命地受其奴役宰割。所谓“武训精神”，就是不要反抗，不要斗争，死心塌地去给反动统治者当牛做马，并为他们宣传剥削有理、压迫有理的精神鸦片，来消弭人民革命意志，巩固反动统治。
    这部反动影片的创作，开始酝酿于中国人民抗日战争走向胜利的一九四四年，而正式投入拍摄则是在编导者被国民党政府派到美国好莱坞考察电影回来以后的第二年，即一九四八年。最后供拍摄的剧本是在美国写的，其中“梦境”一节显然受了好莱坞盛行的描写变态心理的影响。这部影片的编导者实际上是一个美国豢养的御用文人，影片也是首先由伪国民党国防部的中国电影制片厂摄制的。但是，人民解放战争的炮火使他们没有来得及把影片拍完。一九四八年冬，由反革命修正主义分子夏衍、阳翰笙等人支持的私营昆仑影业公司把剧本和已拍摄的部分底片收买过来，编导者也随之被拉入昆仑公司。剧本经夏衍、于伶等修改后，在夏衍的主持下，完成了这个从国民党反动派那里继承来的未竟事业，摄制出大毒草《武训传》上下集。一九五○年，影片经过当时的文化部副部长周扬审定，准予公开上映。
    《武训传》和《清宫秘史》这两株宣扬奴隶主义、投降主义的电影大毒草，差不多同时产生于中国历史上发生伟大变革的一九四九年前后，这决不是偶然的。
    那时候，无产阶级正在建立崭新的无产阶级专政的政权；而旧的反动统治者不甘心于自己的灭亡，随时准备卷土重来。新生的无产阶级政权向何处去？是按照毛主席的教导紧紧地抓住阶级斗争这条纲，在政治、经济、文化各个领域内，把已经开始的社会主义革命进行到底；还是象党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派主张的那样，取消阶级斗争，竭力保持一切旧事物使它免于死亡，向反动的剥削阶级投降？
    在这样的关键时刻，抛出这部反动影片，就是为了适应党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级、封建势力的需要，企图把中国拉回到资本主义，为被推翻的蒋介石反动政权招魂。
    毛主席十几年前亲自发动的对反动影片《武训传》的批判，取得了重大的胜利。但是，长期盘踞在文艺界的、受到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派指使与支持的周扬、夏衍等反革命修正主义集团，顽固地反对毛主席的革命文艺路线，抵制对《武训传》的批判。他们千方百计为自己开脱罪责，一口咬定《武训传》的问题“是认识问题”；批判刚开始，周扬就写密信给上海的于伶，指示他“不可急躁鲁莽”，阴谋把这场严重的阶级斗争拖延下去，走过场了事。从一九五三年九月第二次文代会，到一九六二年的宣教工作会议上，周扬反复叫嚷对《武训传》的批判“发生了一些偏向”，“一部分过左了”。这显然是明目张胆地攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    毛主席于一九五四年指出：“被人称为爱国主义影片而实际是卖国主义影片的《清宫秘史》，在全国放映之后，至今没有被批判。《武训传》虽然批判了，却至今没有引出教训”。文化大革命中揭露出来的大量事实，使我们清楚地认识到，至今没有引出教训的根本原因，是文艺界十七年来被党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他所支持的周扬、夏衍反革命修正主义集团专了政。
    我们必须从对反动影片《武训传》的再批判中，引出应有的教训，这就是念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。我们一定要把被周扬、夏衍等反革命修正主义分子篡夺了的文艺界的大权夺回来，把他们和支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，连同反革命修正主义文艺黑线批深批透！
