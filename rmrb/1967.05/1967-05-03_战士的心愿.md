The Soldier's Wish

Guard of Tiananmen Square, PLA soldier Wang Zhiming

On May 1st, I was guarding the gate of the Labor People's Cultural Palace near Tiananmen Square. I heard that Chairman Mao would celebrate the holiday with us, and I was overjoyed.

I had been watching the front intently, waiting for the arrival of our greatest leader, Chairman Mao. Suddenly, thunderous applause and shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao!" erupted. My heart raced with the applause and shouts. I stared fixedly in the direction from which Chairman Mao would come.

Ah! Chairman Mao is coming! I jumped up excitedly, raised my hands high, and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" I was so excited that tears streamed down my face. Chairman Mao's open-top car was getting closer and closer. I saw that Chairman Mao was tall and robust, with a radiant face and a vigorous spirit. Chairman Mao smiled at us and waved, as if he wanted to talk to us, making me feel especially happy and close. I thought, time, please slow down a bit, let me look at our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, for a little longer! Happy tears, please flow a little slower, let me see our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, more clearly!

Chairman Mao came right in front of me, so close. Chairman Mao looked at us, and our gazes met. My heart was about to jump out of my chest. At that moment, I was only aware of my duty to guard, nothing else mattered. I raised my hands high, jumping and shouting with all my might, "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Chairman Mao slowly passed by me. I stood on my tiptoes and watched until Chairman Mao was far away before I calmed down and wiped my tears.

This was the eighth time I had seen Chairman Mao in front of Tiananmen Square. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you care for the people the most, understand the people the most, trust the people the most, rely on the people the most, support the people the most, and love to be with the people. From grand celebrations to receiving Red Guards from all over the country, you always walk among the people, shake hands with everyone, and ask about their well-being with warmth. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are so kind and affectionate to the people. You are the most beloved person of the Chinese people. It is you who led the Chinese people to seize power and build a new red society! It is you who saved us from suffering and misery! The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth, and you are closer to us than our parents. As a son of a poor peasant, I cannot express my love for you, Chairman Mao!

Most beloved Chairman Mao! At this happiest moment, I swear to you: I will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. I will enthusiastically respond to your call to support the military and love the people. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I will actively support the revolutionary masses, unite with them, and fight with them to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!

    战士的心愿
    守卫天安门的解放军战士　王志民
    “五一”节这一天，我守卫在天安门旁劳动人民文化宫的门口。听说毛主席要和大家一起欢度节日，我高兴极了。
    我早就注视着前方，等待着我们最伟大的领袖毛主席的来临。突然，响起了雷鸣般的掌声和“毛主席万岁！”的欢呼声，我的心随着掌声、欢呼声，一阵紧一阵。我目不转睛地望着毛主席要来的方向。
    啊！毛主席来了！我高兴地跳了起来，高举起双手，大声欢呼
  “毛主席万岁！”我兴奋地流出了眼泪。毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车，离我愈来愈近。我看到毛主席身材魁伟，红光满面，精神焕发，身体壮实极了。毛主席朝我们微笑，向我们招手，象是要和我们说话，使我感到特别高兴、亲切。我心里想，时间啊，过的慢一点吧，让我多看一会我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！幸福的眼泪少流一点吧，让我更清楚地看一看我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席！
    毛主席来到了我的跟前，近极了。毛主席看着我们，同我们的目光碰到一起了，我的心快要蹦出来了。这时，我除了意识到自己的守卫任务外，什么也顾不得，只是高举双手，连蹦带跳，用尽所有的气力，高呼：“毛主席万岁，万岁，万万岁！”毛主席慢慢地从我跟前过去了，我踮起脚尖，直看到毛主席走远了，才平静下来，擦一擦泪水。
    在天安门前，我这是第八次见到毛主席。毛主席呀毛主席，您老人家最关心群众，最了解群众，最相信群众，最依靠群众，最支持群众，最爱和群众在一起。从盛大的节日到接见来自全国各地的红卫兵，您老人家总是走到群众中间，与大家握手，亲切询问。毛主席呀，毛主席！您老人家对群众那样爱护，那样慈祥，您是中国人民最贴心的人。是您老人家带领中国人民打天下、创江山，建成了红彤彤的新社会！是您老人家把我们受苦受难的人从水深火热中解救出来！天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如您老人家亲。作为一个贫下中农的子弟，我无法表达出对您老人家热爱的心情啊！
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！在这最幸福的时刻，我向您老人家宣誓：永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，热烈响应您拥军爱民的号召，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中积极支持无产阶级革命派，和他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，誓把文化大革命进行到底！
