The workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary cultural workers of Harbin, with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and deep class feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, recently held a grand parade and artistic performance. This pushed the activities to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in May to a new high.

On the 21st, which was a Sunday, the entire city of Harbin was filled with a festive atmosphere. The artistic troops, dressed in costumes, carried large portraits of Chairman Mao, held up colorful flags, and waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," singing and dancing through the main streets. The banks of the Songhua River, near Stalin Park, were the center of the city's performance activities. Along the several-mile-long embankment, flags were as dense as a forest, songs as vast as the sea, and people as numerous as the ocean. Over a hundred Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams performed short, powerful, and combative excellent programs. They also performed revolutionary model operas like "The Red Lantern" and the revolutionary symphony "The Battle of Shanggang," which they had rehearsed in a very short time, for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

During the performances, tens of thousands of spectators continuously raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! A hundred thousand years!"

    哈尔滨演出短小精悍的战斗性的精采节目
    哈尔滨市广大工农兵、红卫兵小将和革命文艺工作者，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对毛主席的文艺路线无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，最近举行了声势浩大的游行和文艺演出，把庆祝毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的红五月文艺演出活动推向新的高潮。
    二十一日正是星期天，哈尔滨市全城到处是一派欢腾景象。化装游行的文艺大军，抬着毛主席的巨幅画像，高举彩旗，挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，载歌载舞地通过主要街道。松花江畔的斯大林公园是全市演出活动的中心。在几里长的堤岸上，旗如林，歌如潮，人如海。上百支毛泽东思想宣传队表演了短小精悍的富有战斗性的精采节目。他们在很短时间内赶排出来的革命样板戏《红灯记》、革命交响乐《沙家浜》也和广大工农兵见了面。
    在演出中成千上万的观众不断和演员们一起振臂高呼：“毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
