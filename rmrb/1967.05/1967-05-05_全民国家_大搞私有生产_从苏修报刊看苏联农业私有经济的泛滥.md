One-Fifth of the People Engage in Private Work

	Calculations and investigations show that while there is a shortage of labor in the eastern regions of our country, there are also a considerable number of able-bodied adults who do not participate in public production in some regions. In 1959, the number of collective farm members and workers' family members engaged in personal sideline production was 9.9 million. In addition, it is estimated that there are 12.8 million people engaged in household chores, accounting for 17.7% of the national labor force. At the beginning of the seven-year plan, the average number of able-bodied residents in the entire Soviet Union who engaged in personal sideline production and did not participate in public production was 20%. In Siberia, it reached 26%. In the North Caucasus, about one-fifth of the able-bodied residents were engaged in private production and did not participate in public production.

	The Market is Flooded with Private Goods

	Currently, the "rulers" of the market are not the thousands of hectares of land owned by collective farms, but private plots of land. They are also the price setters.

	Take a look at the following figures. In 1965, all collective farms in the republic (referring to the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic) harvested 330,000 tons of potatoes and 620,000 tons of vegetables. State farms harvested 2,214,000 tons of potatoes and 3,429,000 tons of vegetables. However, the private sector harvested 8,740,000 tons of potatoes and 1,783,000 tons of vegetables.

	The Sales Volume of Private Products Continues to Increase

	Except for the area south of the city near the sea, all the roads around lead to Taganrog. Every Saturday and Sunday morning, these roads are particularly bustling. They are filled with farmers coming from various villages in the suburbs. Cars and suburban trains continuously transport vegetables, fruits, honey, poultry, meat, eggs, oil, and sour cream, all products of the personal sideline production of collective farmers in the surrounding areas, to the market in Taganrog.

	The deputy manager of the central market showed me (the reporter) a statistical table: the sales volume of various products in 1965 and the first five months of 1966. The sales volume of almost all categories of products has increased. Meat was 529 tons, 450 tons in 1965; vegetables were 1,891 tons, 1,289 tons in 1965; potatoes were 3,637 tons, 3,263 tons in 1965, and so on.

	The "Profitable" Occupation

	I (a village girl) live in Dneprovka village and have completed eight years of schooling. I want to continue my studies, but my father said that this is enough: science does not bring bread, all the smart people work in their own gardens and make big money—you should do the same.

	Last summer (referring to 1965), I went to Moscow, Odessa, Kursk, Minsk, Belgorod, and Tula to do business. I went a total of eight times. My mother also accompanied me to sell cucumbers, watermelons, melons, and pears. We sold a total of 1,700 rubles. Previously, we had 0.2 hectares of garden, now it has doubled to 0.4 hectares.

	Private Economy Becomes the Main Source of Income

	In many regions, collective farmers have excessively expanded private economy, turning it from a sideline into the main source of income.

    “全民国家”大搞私有生产
    ——从苏修报刊看苏联农业私有经济的泛滥
                  五分之一的人干私活
    计算和调查表明：在我国东部地区劳动力不足的同时，在某些地区却有着为数不少的未参加公有生产的有劳动能力的成年居民。在一九五九年，从事个人副业的集体农庄庄员和职工的家庭成员人数为九百九十万。此外，从事家务的人估计达一千二百八十万，占全国劳动力的百分之十七点七。七年计划初期，从事个人副业，不参加公有生产的有劳动能力的居民在全苏联平均为百分之二十。在西伯利亚达到百分之二十六。在北高加索大约有五分之一的有劳动力的居民都在从事私有生产，而不参加公有生产。

      市场充斥大批私货
    目前，市场的“主宰者”不是集体农庄的成千上万公顷的土地，而是私有的宅旁园地了。它们也是市价的制订者。
    请你看一看如下的数字吧。一九六五年，共和国（指哈萨克斯坦共和国）所有集体农庄收获土豆三十三万公担，蔬菜六十二万公担，国营农场收获土豆二百二十一万四千公担，蔬菜三百四十二万九千公担，而私有部分却收获土豆八百七十四万公担，蔬菜一百七十八万三千公担。

              私人产品出售额不断增长
    除了城南紧靠大海的地方以外，周围的大道条条通向塔干洛格。每逢星期六和星期日的早晨，这些大道上显得特别热闹。路上都是从郊区各个村庄赶来的农民。汽车和郊区火车络绎不绝地把蔬菜、水果、蜂蜜、家禽、肉类、蛋类、油类、酸奶酪等邻近地区集体农民个人副业所拥有的一切产品，运往塔干洛格的集市。
    中心集市副经理给我（该报记者）看了一份统计表：一九六五年和一九六六年前五个月里出售了多少产品。各类产品的出售额几乎都增长了。肉类是五百二十九吨，一九六五年是四百五十吨；蔬菜是一千八百九十一吨，一九六五年是一千二百八十九吨；土豆是三千六百三十七吨，一九六五年是三千二百六十三吨等等。
                                        摘自《劳动报》
                  赚大钱的“职业”
    我（一农村姑娘）住在德聂伯罗夫克村里，念完了八年级。我想上学，可是父亲说，就这些已经够了：科学带不来面包，所有的聪明人都在自己的菜园里劳动，赚大钱——你也这样做吧。
    去年（指一九六五年）夏天，我到莫斯科、敖德萨、库尔斯克、明斯克、别尔戈罗德、图拉去做买卖。一共去了八次。母亲也跟我一起卖黄瓜、西瓜、甜瓜和梨子。一共卖了一千七百卢布。以前我们有十分之二公顷菜园，现在增加了一倍，共有零点四公顷。

             私有经济变成   收入主要来源
    许多地区的集体农民过分地使私有经济膨胀，私有经济从副业变成了收入的主要来源。
