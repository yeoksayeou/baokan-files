While threatening with force, plotting political conspiracies: the U.S., Soviet Union, and Britain conspire to extinguish Arab people's anti-American fury

	New York, May 25 (Xinhua) The U.S. imperialists and their number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist leadership, are intensifying their collusion, doing everything they can to shield the U.S.'s tool of aggression in the Middle East, Israel. They are openly threatening with force on one hand, and plotting political conspiracies on the other, attempting to extinguish the Arab people's anti-American fury.

	On May 24, a "authoritative" figure from the U.S. Department of Defense threatened Arab countries, saying that the U.S. Sixth Fleet, composed of 50 warships, is "prepared to deal with any situation in the Mediterranean." According to the Associated Press, on the same day, the U.S. ambassador to the UAR, Norton, unreasonably accused the UAR government of declaring the closure of the Gulf of Aqaba as "violating international law," and openly threatened that if necessary, the U.S. would use force to reopen the Gulf of Aqaba; the U.S. "will take all measures within and outside the United Nations to deal with aggression." At the same time, according to Western news agencies, Soviet naval vessels are also "patrolling near the hotspot of the Middle East crisis."

	British Prime Minister Wilson also jumped out to support the U.S. imperialists, threatening that any country's ships have the right to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba, and the British government "will uphold this right of all British ships." On May 24, the British government also announced that its fleet in the Mediterranean is "on alert."

	In diplomacy, the imperialists led by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are also intensifying their conspiratorial activities. According to the British "Times," the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been engaged in ambassador-level secret talks discussing the Middle East situation. British Foreign Secretary Brown held approximately five hours of secret talks with Gromyko and Kosygin in Moscow on May 24. On the same day, British Minister of State Thompson, sent by Wilson to Washington for "emergency talks" with the U.S. government, held more than five hours of secret talks with U.S. Secretary of State Rusk, Deputy Secretary of State Rostow, and other high-ranking officials on the Middle East situation. Thompson admitted after the talks that he discussed with the U.S. government "practical ways and means" to undermine the UAR's decision to close the Gulf of Aqaba.

	According to reports, U.S. President Johnson wrote a letter to U Thant, the current UN Secretary-General in Cairo, urging him to "pressure" the UAR to withdraw its decision to close the Gulf of Aqaba.

	At the same time, under U.S. instructions, Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban went to Washington for "emergency consultations" on May 24. En route, he had secret talks with French President de Gaulle and British Prime Minister Wilson. In addition, the U.S.'s puppet Tito also wrote a letter to UAR President Nasser.

	According to the Associated Press, in the above series of "emergency diplomatic discussions," a "Middle East peace plan" is being concocted, under U.S. control, for the United Nations to intervene, with the aim of extinguishing the increasingly intense anti-American fervor of the Arab people.

    一面进行武力威胁　一面策划政治阴谋
    美苏英合谋扑灭阿拉伯人民反美怒火
    新华社二十五日讯  美帝国主义和它的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团正加紧勾结，千方百计地庇护美帝在中东的侵略工具以色列。它们一方面显示武力进行公开威胁，一方面策划政治阴谋，力图扑灭阿拉伯人民的反美怒火。
    美国国防部“权威人士”二十四日威胁阿拉伯国家说，由五十艘军舰组成的美国第六舰队“准备对付地中海发生的任何事情”。据合众国际社报道，在同一天，美国驻阿联大使诺尔蒂无理指责阿联政府宣布封闭亚喀巴湾是“违反了国际法”，并公然恫吓说，如果有必要，美国将使用武力，使亚喀巴湾开放；美国“将在联合国内外采取一切措施来对付侵略”。与此同时，据西方通讯社报道，苏联的海军舰只也在“中东危机的焦点附近巡逻”。
    英国首相威尔逊也跳出来为美帝帮腔，他威胁说，任何国家的船只都有权通过亚喀巴湾，英国政府“将维护所有英国船只的这一权利”。英国政府二十四日并宣布它驻在地中海的舰队“处于戒备状态”。
    在外交方面，以美国为首的帝国主义和苏修也在加紧进行阴谋活动。据英国《泰晤士报》透露，美国和苏联一直在进行大使级的密谈，讨论中东局势。英国外交大臣布朗二十四日在莫斯科先后同葛罗米柯和柯西金进行了约五小时的密谈。同一天，被威尔逊派到华盛顿同美国政府举行“紧急会谈”的英国国务大臣汤姆森，同美国国务卿腊斯克、副国务卿罗斯托等高级官员就中东局势进行了五个多小时的秘密会谈。汤姆森在会谈后承认，他同美国政府讨论了破坏阿联宣布的封闭亚喀巴湾的决定的“实际可行的办法和手段”。
    另据报道，美国总统约翰逊写了一封信给目前正在开罗活动的联合国秘书长吴丹，要他对阿联“施加压力”，迫使阿联政府撤销关于封闭亚喀巴湾的决定。
    同时，在美国指使下，以色列外交部长阿巴·埃班在二十四日前往华盛顿“进行紧急磋商”。途中，他曾同法国总统戴高乐、英国首相威尔逊密谈。此外，美国的走狗铁托也曾写信给阿联总统纳赛尔。
    据合众国际社透露，在上述一系列“紧急外交讨论”中，正在炮制一项规定由美国操纵下的联合国出面干涉的“中东和平方案”，目的就是把越烧越旺的阿拉伯人民的反美烈火扑灭下去。
