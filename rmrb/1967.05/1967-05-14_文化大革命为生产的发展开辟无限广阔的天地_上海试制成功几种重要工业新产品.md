The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up boundless prospects for the development of production. In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, many factories have, after the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power, resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and launched a new high tide of revolution and production. In some factories, new products that had long been unsuccessful in trials have now been successfully developed.

	Vitamin D3 Crystals

	After the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Dongfanghong Pharmaceutical Factory seized power, they not only completed the state plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it every month for the past three months, but also successfully developed a new product that catches up with the world's advanced level—Vitamin D3 crystals, filling a gap in China's pharmaceutical industry. This achievement greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary factions and dealt a heavy blow to the arrogance of American imperialism.

	Vitamin D3 crystals are used to treat rickets in children. Previously, China had to import this vitamin every year. The Dongfanghong Pharmaceutical Factory began developing Vitamin D3 crystals last year. Due to the lack of complete technical data, insufficient equipment, and resistance from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the development process was slow. After the proletarian revolutionary factions took control of the factory, they decided to speed up the development work.

	During the development process, revolutionary workers, technicians, and revolutionary cadres kept in mind Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies, the determination to restore our lost territories on the basis of self-reliance, and the ability to stand on our own feet among the nations of the world." They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, displaying the spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and revolutionize. They broke through foreign constraints, boldly reformed technology, and carried out technological innovations, continuously solving key problems based on actual situations. After several months of effort, Vitamin D3 crystals were finally successfully developed and put into formal production. The results of the appraisal by relevant departments showed that the successfully developed Vitamin D3 crystals, in terms of quality and yield, have surpassed international advanced levels, adding a glorious page to the history of China's pharmaceutical industry.

	New Type of Bundling Machine

	Recently, the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Shanghai Plastic Wire Factory successfully developed a high-speed micro-double bundling machine. This bundling machine, after appraisal and use, performed well.

	The bundling machine is used to produce various specifications of copper wire plastic insulated wires. The original bundling machines in this factory could only produce copper wire plastic insulated wires with a diameter of 0.1 millimeters or more. If thinner copper wire plastic insulated wires were needed, they had to be processed by external units, resulting in low production efficiency and unstable quality. The revolutionary workers in this factory had long wanted to solve this problem. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the factory had long relied on a few bourgeois "technical authorities," suppressing the enthusiasm of the workers.

	In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionary factions in this factory seized back the leadership of the factory and bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. The revolutionary comrades in the machine repair team of the factory's machine workshop said: We not only dare to rebel against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the "Four Olds," but we also want to rebel against old machines. They boldly proposed to make a high-speed micro-double bundling machine themselves. This proposal immediately received support from other revolutionary factions. At the beginning of the development, there were no drawings, so they drew them themselves; there were no technical data, so they referred to the factory's equipment and long-term accumulated machine repair experience, developing and improving as they went. They displayed a brave fighting spirit, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous combat, overcoming many difficulties. In addition to completing the machine repair tasks, after more than a month of trials, they finally successfully developed the high-speed micro-double bundling machine.

	A New Type of Die-Casting Machine

	Recently, a new type of J-116 63-ton horizontal cold chamber die-casting machine was successfully manufactured in the Shanghai Die-Casting Machine Factory. The quality of this machine fully meets the requirements after appraisal by relevant units.

	The various types of die-casting machines produced by this factory have long been imitations of foreign machines. In the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers and technicians in this factory broke through foreign constraints and designed a J-116 horizontal cold chamber die-casting machine. However, the capitalist-roaders within the Party in the factory only believed in "experts" and "technical authorities," completely not believing in the wisdom of the broad revolutionary workers and technicians. They used various excuses to delay the development. After the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power, they immediately put the development of this new product on the agenda. They said, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party do not believe in us revolutionary masses, but we must develop this new product successfully. Difficulties are many, but they cannot frighten the proletarian revolutionary factions armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history," they mobilized the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary technicians to contribute their ideas. The factory and workshop space were small, so they solved the problem by adjusting the workshops; the machinery and equipment were insufficient, so they carried out technical cooperation between workshops, increasing production shifts without increasing the number of people. After several months of effort, they overcame various difficulties and finally successfully developed the J-116 63-ton horizontal cold chamber die-casting machine.

	This die-casting machine is smaller in size, has one-third fewer parts, saves materials, is cheaper to produce, and has good performance. It is also convenient to install, maintain, and use.

    文化大革命为生产的发展开辟无限广阔的天地
    上海试制成功几种重要工业新产品
    据新华社上海十三日电　史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命为生产的发展开辟了无限广阔的天地。在我国最大的工业城市上海，许多工厂的无产阶级革命派夺权以后，坚决贯彻毛主席发出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，掀起了革命、生产新高潮。在一些工厂，过去长期没有试制成功的新产品现在试制出来了。
    维生素丁3结晶
    东方红制药厂无产阶级革命派夺权以后，三个多月来不仅月月提前超额完成国家计划，而且试制成功了赶超世界先进水平的新产品——维生素丁3结晶，为祖国医药工业填补了空白。这一成就大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了美帝国主义的威风。
    维生素丁3结晶是专治小孩软骨病的。过去，我国每年都要向国外进口。东方红制药厂从去年开始进行维生素丁3结晶的试制工作。由于没有完整的技术资料，缺乏必要的设备，加上来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阻力，因此，试制工作进展缓慢。这个厂的无产阶级革命派自己掌握了革命和生产的命运以后，便决心加快试制工作。
    在试制过程中，革命工人、技术人员和革命干部牢记着毛主席的教导：“我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概，有在自力更生的基础上光复旧物的决心，有自立于世界民族之林的能力。”他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬敢想、敢说、敢闯、敢干、敢革命的精神，打破了洋框框，大胆改革工艺，大搞技术革新，不断根据实际情况解决关键问题。经过几个月的努力，维生素丁3结晶终于试制成功，并且正式投入生产。经有关部门鉴定结果，试制成功的维生素丁3结晶，无论在质量和收率方面，都已超过了国际先进水平，为祖国医药工业史增添了光辉的一页。
    新型束丝机
    上海塑胶线厂的无产阶级革命派最近试制成功一台高速微型双倍束丝机。这台束丝机，经过鉴定、使用，效果良好。
    束丝机是用于生产各种不同规格的铜丝塑胶电线的。这家工厂原有的束丝机，只能生产七根零点一毫米以上线径的铜丝塑胶电线。如果要生产比这更细一点的铜丝塑胶线，就要靠外单位加工，生产效率低，质量也不稳定。这家工厂的革命工人早就想解决这个问题。但是，厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，长期以来只相信和依靠少数资产阶级“技术权威”，不放手发动群众，压制了工人的积极性。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，这个工厂的无产阶级革命派夺回了厂里的领导权，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。工厂金工车间维修小组的革命派同志说：我们不但敢于造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造“四旧”的反，而且还要造旧机器的反。他们大胆地提出要自己动手制造一台高速微型双倍束丝机。这个建议立即得到其他部门革命派的支持。开始制造时，没有图纸，他们就自己画；没有技术资料，就参照厂里的机器设备和长期积累的机修经验，边试制，边改进。他们发扬勇敢战斗、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，克服了许多困难，在完成机修任务外，经过一个多月的试验，终于把这台高速微型双倍束丝机试制成功。
    一种新的压铸机
    一台新型的Ｊ—一一六型六十三吨卧式冷室压铸机，最近在上海压铸机制造厂制造成功。经有关单位鉴定，质量完全符合要求。
    这个厂生产的各种类型压铸机，长期以来都是仿造国外的。在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的广大革命职工、技术人员打破洋框框，设计了一台Ｊ—一一六型卧式冷室压铸机。可是，厂里的走资本主义道路当权派只相信“专家”“技术权威”，根本不相信广大革命职工和技术人员的智慧，他们用种种借口迟迟不安排试制。这个厂的无产阶级革命派夺权以后，立即把这项新产品试制工作提到议事日程上来。他们说，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不相信我们革命群众，我们非要把这项新产品试制成功不可。困难多，吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派！他们根据毛主席“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”的教导，发动广大革命职工、革命技术人员出谋献策。厂房场地小，他们就用调整车间的办法来解决；机器设备不足，就在车间之间开展技术大协作，在不增加人的前提下增开生产班次来解决。经过几个月的努力，克服了各种困难，终于把这台Ｊ—一一六型六十三吨卧式冷室压铸机试制成功了。
    这台压铸机，比这个厂原来仿造国外的压铸机体积小，零件少三分之一，不但用料省，造价便宜，而且性能好，安装、检修、使用都很方便。
