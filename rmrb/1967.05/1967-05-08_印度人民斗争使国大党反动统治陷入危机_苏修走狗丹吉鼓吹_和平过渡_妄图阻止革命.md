As the Indian people's struggle against the Indian reactionary government, which is a lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, continues to develop, the Soviet revisionist lackey and traitor Dange has once again emerged to spread the fallacy of "peaceful transition," attempting to numb the Indian people's revolutionary will and to induce the Indian people to abandon revolutionary struggle.

The Dange Group Peddles Soviet Revisionist Goods and Covers Up the Reactionary Nature of the Indian Government

According to a report by the _Indian Express_ on April 26, Dange shamelessly covered up the reactionary nature of the Indian government at a meeting held in Calcutta on April 24, loudly proclaiming that "in India, a peaceful transition to socialism is possible."

Dange falsely claimed that the fourth general election in India, held under the bayonets of the police and secret service in February, had brought about a "change in the power structure," and that the election results had "raised hopes for a transition to socialism through peaceful means." He also described his group's counter-revolutionary line as "basically correct." He said that his group's strategy conformed to the so-called "new line" proposed at the 20th Congress of the CPSU.

According to Dange's disclosure on April 24, his group will soon propose talks with the Communist Party of India and other political parties to form a "provisional central government" and to "overthrow the National Congress Party government through peaceful means."

The fallacies peddled by the Dange traitor group are nothing but old clichés of the veteran revisionists Bernstein, Kautsky, and the modern revisionists like Khrushchev, merely adapted to the Indian context. The Soviet revisionist leadership has long dreamed of making India a "model" of "peaceful transition." Now, the Dange group, following the instructions of its Soviet revisionist masters, has once again seized the opportunity after the so-called fourth general election in India to peddle the worn-out goods of "peaceful transition."

Reversing Black and White, Intensifying Political Deception, and Strenuously Assisting the National Congress Party Government

The traitor Dange reverses black and white, distorts the situation after the so-called fourth general election in India, and fabricates a basis for his fallacy of "peaceful transition."

What is the real situation?

After this general election in India, a central government led by Indira Gandhi and Desai was formed, which is extremely pro-American and traitorous. This National Congress Party government is still a reactionary regime of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie. It is strengthening the military, police, and other repressive tools in all aspects to suppress the Indian people. Despite the extremely difficult economic situation, this government is still expanding the military and has made a huge military budget of approximately one-third of the total expenditure. It has sent a large number of troops to the eastern border regions of India to brutally suppress the Nagas and Mizos who are engaged in armed resistance. Recently, bloody incidents of police violence suppressing workers and peasants have continued to occur in some cities and villages in India.

In the local governments, some "non-National Congress Party" state governments have emerged. This reflects the decay and decline of the National Congress Party, the main tool of the reactionary rule of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, under the resistance of the Indian people. However, in the states governed by the so-called "non-National Congress Party" governments, the feudal and comprador forces are still in power from top to bottom. Such state governments, despite being nominally "non-National Congress Party" governments, are merely changing the soup but not the medicine, and the reactionary nature of the government has not changed at all.

Among the "non-National Congress Party" state governments, there are the governments of Kerala and West Bengal, where part of the Communist Party of India is in power. These two state governments are also components of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie's state machine. They are directly controlled by the Indian central government and cannot carry out any substantial reforms. They cannot fundamentally touch the capitalist and feudal production relations. Moreover, as long as the Indian central government deems it necessary, it can take over all the functions of the state government under the name of "presidential rule." In 1959, the Kerala state government was taken over in this way.

These facts show that without a people's revolution, without violently seizing power, and without smashing the old state machine, it is impossible to change the social system and the nature of the government, and it is impossible to carry out fundamental social reforms. There has never been a precedent in the past, and there is no possibility of it happening now.

The Dange group is spreading the poison of "peaceful transition" at this time to assist the reactionary rule of the National Congress Party.

Under the reactionary rule of the National Congress Party, the broad masses of the Indian people are suffering increasingly cruel oppression and exploitation, and more and more people are struggling on the brink of hunger and death. This situation is awakening the Indian people of all classes and pushing them to launch anti-hunger and anti-tyranny struggles. In recent times, strikes, food looting, and weapon seizures have been occurring frequently in various parts of India. The Nagas and Mizos, who have been persistently engaged in armed struggle, have continued to launch multiple attacks on the Indian reactionary army.

To maintain the increasingly unstable reactionary rule, the Indian ruling clique is intensifying political deception while brutally suppressing the people's struggles. At present, it is using the situation of the emergence of "non-National Congress Party" state governments after the general election to operate its propaganda machine, loudly praising bourgeois "democracy," and attempting to use the deceptive effects of these "non-National Congress Party" state governments to ease contradictions, control the situation, and "suppress" the development of the people's struggles. Some reactionary party leaders who have newly come to power locally are also using the political capital they have gained from being "anti-National Congress Party" to put forward some reformist slogans and adopt some deceptive measures, attempting to distinguish themselves from the National Congress Party in appearance, to win hearts and minds, and to consolidate the reactionary regime.

The Dange traitor group is closely cooperating with the National Congress Party's political deception plot, colluding with another small group of revisionists who share the same heart, using the establishment of "non-National Congress Party" governments in Kerala and West Bengal to loudly advocate the "Kerala Road," advocating that the "united front" of the Communist Party of India with the Dange group "should be promoted nationwide"; spreading the fallacy that it is possible to comfortably realize a "peaceful transition" without armed struggle. Its sinister purpose is to attempt to induce the Indian people to abandon revolutionary struggle, to lose vigilance in the face of the violent attacks of the Indian reactionaries, and to await their doom.

The Dange group is a lackey raised by imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to sabotage the Indian revolution. This traitor group has played a role in sabotaging the Indian people's revolutionary struggle that the Indian reactionaries cannot play. The Indian people must resolutely overthrow the traitor Dange group and various revisionists to win liberation and must resolutely carry out revolutionary struggle.

In the long-term struggle against the reactionary rule of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, the Indian people are gradually realizing the truth pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the strength of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun." "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable; without this, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize power."

The laws of history are unchangeable. No one can stop the tide of the Indian people's revolution, and no one can save the Indian reactionary ruling clique and the Dange traitor group from their doom. Victory will certainly belong to the Indian people.

    印度人民斗争使国大党反动统治陷入危机
    苏修走狗丹吉鼓吹“和平过渡”妄图阻止革命
    新华社七日讯　本社记者评述：正当印度人民反对美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的仆从印度反动政府的斗争日益发展的时候，苏修在印度的走狗叛徒丹吉又一次跳出来散布“和平过渡”的谬论，妄图麻痹印度人民的革命意志，诱骗印度人民放弃革命斗争。
    丹吉集团贩卖苏修货色  掩盖印度政府反动本质
    据《印度斯坦旗报》四月二十六日报道，丹吉二十四日在加尔各答举行的一次会议上，无耻地掩盖印度政府的反动本质，大肆叫嚷“在印度，和平过渡到社会主义是可能的。”
    丹吉胡说今年二月在警察特务的刺刀尖下举行的印度第四届大选使印度发生了“权力结构的变化”，说什么大选的结果“引起了通过和平途径向社会主义转变的希望”。他还把他的集团的反革命路线，说成是“基本上正确的”。他说，他的集团采取的策略，是符合苏共第二十次代表大会提出的所谓“新路线”的。
    据丹吉二十四日透露，他的集团不久将倡议同印度共产党和其他一些政党举行会谈，以便成立一个“候补中央政府”，通过“和平途径”来“推翻国大党政府”。
    丹吉叛徒集团所鼓吹的，只不过是老牌修正主义者伯恩斯坦、考茨基之流和现代修正主义者赫鲁晓夫之流的陈词滥调，只不过是什么和平地“长入社会主义”，什么“只要取得议会中稳定的多数，就可以实现社会主义改造”的印度版。苏修领导集团早就梦想把印度作为“和平过渡”的“典范”了。现在，丹吉集团又一次按照它的苏修主子的意图，趁着所谓印度第四届大选过后的时机，抛出了“和平过渡”的破烂货色。
    颠倒黑白加紧政治欺骗  竭力为国大党政府帮忙
    叛徒丹吉颠倒黑白，歪曲印度“第四届大选”以后的情况，来为他的“和平过渡”谬论制造根据。
    事实真相又是如何呢？
    在这次印度大选后，以英迪拉·甘地和德赛为首，组成了一个极端亲美卖国的印度中央政府。这个国大党政府，照旧是印度大地主大资产阶级专政的反动政权。它正在各方面加强军队警察等专政工具，镇压印度人民。这个政府在经济情况极为困难的条件下，仍然大肆扩军，作出了占总支出大约三分之一的庞大军费预算。它派遣大量援军，到印度东部边境地区疯狂镇压进行武装反抗的那加族和米佐部族人民。最近，在印度的一些城市和乡村中，继续发生了警察暴力镇压工人、农民的血腥事件。
    在地方政府方面，出现了一些“非国大党”组成的邦政府。这反映了在印度人民的反抗下，印度大地主大资产阶级反动统治的主要工具国大党的腐朽没落。但是，在所谓“非国大党”政府统治下的那些邦里，从上到下，仍然是地方上的封建、买办势力在当权。这样的邦政府，尽管名义上是“非国大党”政府，也是换汤不换药，政权的反动性质丝毫没有改变。
    在“非国大党”邦政府中，包括印度共产党人部分当政的喀拉拉邦和西孟加拉邦政府。这两个邦政府，同样是印度大地主大资产阶级国家机器的组成部分，它们处于印度中央政府的直接控制下，根本不可能进行任何实质性的改革，不可能从根本上触动资本主义和封建主义的生产关系。而且，只要印度中央政府认为必要，它就可以用“总统统治”的名义，接管邦政府全部职能。在一九五九年，喀拉拉邦政府就是这样被接管了的。
    这些说明，不经过人民革命，不用暴力夺取政权，不打碎旧的国家机器，绝不可能改变社会制度和政权性质，绝不可能实行根本的社会改革，过去从来没有先例，现在也毫无可能。
    丹吉集团在现在这个时候散布“和平过渡”的毒药，是为了帮国大党反动统治的忙。
    在国大党反动政权下，广大印度人民遭受越来越残酷的压迫和剥削，越来越多的人挣扎在饥饿和死亡线上。这种情况正在促使印度各阶层人民逐步觉醒，开展反饥饿、反暴政斗争。最近以来，印度各地罢工，抢粮，抢武器的行动此伏彼起。一直在坚持武装斗争的那加族和米佐部族，继续多次袭击印度反动军队。
    为了维持日益不稳的反动统治，印度统治集团在对人民斗争实行血腥镇压的同时，正在加紧进行政治欺骗。目前，它利用大选后出现“非国大党”邦政府的情况，开动它的宣传机器，大肆吹嘘资产阶级“民主”，企图利用这些“非国大党”邦政府的欺骗作用来缓和矛盾，控制局势，“遏制”人民斗争的发展。一些在地方上新当权的反动党派的头子，也利用他们“反国大党”捞得的政治资本，提出一些改良主义的口号，采取一些欺骗措施，力图在外貌上区别于国大党，借以笼络人心，巩固反动政权。
    历史规律不可阻挡  胜利必将属于人民
    丹吉叛徒集团正是密切配合国大党的政治欺骗阴谋，伙同和他们心心相印的另外一小撮修正主义分子，利用喀拉拉邦、西孟加拉邦成立“非国大党”政府，大肆鼓吹“喀拉拉道路”，鼓吹印度共产党同丹吉集团的“统一战线”“应当在全国推广”；散布什么不经过武装斗争就可以舒舒服服地实现“和平过渡”的谬论。它的险恶目的，就是妄图诱使印度人民放弃革命斗争，面对印度反动派的暴力进攻，失去警惕，束手待毙。
    丹吉集团是帝国主义和苏修领导集团豢养的、用来破坏印度革命的走狗。这个叛徒集团在破坏印度人民革命斗争方面，起了印度反动派所不能起的作用。印度人民要争取解放，就必须坚决打倒叛徒丹吉集团和形形色色的修正主义者，坚决开展革命斗争。
    印度人民在反对印度大地主大资产阶级反动统治的长期斗争中，正在逐步认识到我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的真理：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    历史的规律是不能改变的。谁也阻挡不了印度人民革命的洪流，谁也挽救不了印度反动统治集团和丹吉叛徒集团灭亡的命运。胜利必将属于印度人民。
