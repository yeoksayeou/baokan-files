In the "May 22" incident, workers from five publishing, trading, and banking institutions in Hong Kong, including the Commercial Press, held a meeting on May 23 to angrily denounce the unprecedented scale of mass arrests and massacres carried out by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The workers firmly declared that blood debts must be repaid with blood. Hong Kong Chinese compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice themselves. They will resolutely continue this just struggle against the British authorities' fascist atrocities until victory is achieved, ensuring that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flies high and forever in Hong Kong.

In the "May 22" incident, 150 workers from these five institutions and five other sister units were brutally beaten and arrested by the British "Special Squad" while on their way to protest at the Governor's residence. Most were seriously injured, and only a few were rescued. At that time, these outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, bravely and tenaciously fought against the British authorities' fascist thugs.

On the afternoon of May 23, nine representatives from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Oppression, along with representatives from news, publishing, and film industries, gathered at the Commercial Press to express their sincere condolences and high respect to the injured comrades. They also held a discussion meeting to angrily denounce the British authorities' inhuman fascist atrocities.

The representatives from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Oppression said, "You have been injured in the struggle to defend the great Mao Zedong Thought and to uphold the dignity of the Chinese people. This is an honor. You have fought well, and your heroic deeds have set a shining example for the four million compatriots in Hong Kong. In recent years, the patriotic workers in the Hong Kong publishing industry have actively spread Mao Zedong Thought, bringing truth to the Hong Kong compatriots. Imperialism is terrified and hates this deeply. The British authorities have deliberately and systematically carried out a series of bloody atrocities, aiming to suppress the influence of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, the British authorities have miscalculated. They do not understand that Chinese compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought are truly an iron wall. We, the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, have united closely. We will definitely give the British authorities a hundredfold retaliation. As the British authorities escalate their oppression, our struggle against oppression will also escalate. Blood for blood, we will fight until the British authorities bow their heads and admit their crimes. We will not rest until we achieve complete victory."

A wounded worker from the Commercial Press reported on how he applied Chairman Mao's teachings in the struggle. He said, "When I faced hundreds of fascist wolves, I was not afraid at all but was full of fighting spirit. When I saw a comrade being beaten by thugs, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: 'All revolutionary comrades must care for, love, and help each other.' I bravely went to rescue him. The thugs immediately turned to attack me. They grabbed my hair and beat my head and back with batons. Although I was seriously injured and blood was streaming from my head, I did not retreat at all. My mind was filled with only one thought: to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and stand firmly on the self-defense position to resolutely fight back against the fascist thugs."

Representatives from various units said: We are all victims of British bloody suppression, and we are class brothers with a common heart. We must unite, fight together, and win together. The more imperialism hates Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must propagate Mao Zedong Thought, letting the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the world.

At the meetings held in Dehsin Row, Chung Fook Row, and Wah Yuen Company, many workers who were beaten and injured by British fascist thugs, including some who were too seriously injured to attend, made angry denunciations.

The workers said, "Our just struggle is not isolated. With Chairman Mao as our strong backing, with the seven hundred million people of our motherland, with the powerful People's Liberation Army, and with the brave Red Guards as our strong support, our struggle will definitely achieve victory. The blood debt owed by British imperialism must be repaid!"

Workers of the Salt Industry Bank held a denunciation meeting on the evening of May 23.

The broad masses of workers at the Kowloon Workers' Club strongly protested against the British authorities' continuous bloody atrocities against Hong Kong workers and compatriots, holding a "Struggle Against British Oppression Meeting." This is a scene of the workers raising their fists and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

    香港同胞集会愤怒控诉港英当局大逮捕大屠杀的暴行
    紧密团结坚决给港英当局以十倍百倍的还击
    他们说，有毛主席做靠山，有祖国七亿人民和解放军做后盾，一定能取得胜利。
    据新华社香港二十四日电　在“五·二二”事件中站在反迫害斗争第一线的香港三联书店等五个出版、贸易、银行机构的职工，二十三日举行集会，愤怒控诉港英当局制造空前规模的大逮捕、大屠杀的法西斯血腥暴行。职工们坚决表示，血债要用血来偿还，用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国同胞，将不惜流血牺牲，誓把这场抗击港英当局法西斯暴行的正义斗争进行到底，要让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在香港上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬。
    在“五·二二”事件中，这五个机构同另外五个兄弟单位的职工一百五十多人，在前往港英“总督府”抗议的途中，被港英的所谓“特种防暴队”截住毒打，大多数人重伤被捕，只有几个人被抢救出来。当时，这些用毛泽东思想武装起来的中华民族的优秀儿女，同港英当局的法西斯暴徒进行了英勇顽强的反迫害斗争。
    二十三日下午四时，港九各界同胞反对港英当局迫害斗争委员会的九名代表，以及新闻、出版、电影等单位的职工代表陆续来到三联书店，向受伤的战友致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意，并同书店的职工们一起举行了座谈会，愤怒控诉港英当局灭绝人性的法西斯暴行。
    港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会的代表们说，你们为了捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，维护中国人民的尊严，在斗争中受了伤，这是光荣的。你们斗得好，你们的英勇事迹给全香港四百万同胞树立了光辉的学习榜样。近年来，香港出版界爱国职工积极传播毛泽东思想，给香港同胞带来了真理，帝国主义对此害怕得要死，恨之入骨。港英当局这次有组织、有计划、有预谋地制造一连串的血腥暴行，目的之一就是妄想用暴力镇压来遏阻伟大的毛泽东思想的影响和我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响。但是，港英当局打错了算盘，它不懂得，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国同胞是真正的铜墙铁壁。我港九同胞已经紧紧地团结起来了，我们一定要给港英当局十倍、百倍的还击。港英当局的迫害升级，我们的反迫害斗争也要升级，血债血偿，我们一定要斗到港英当局低头认罪，不获全胜，誓不罢休。
    三联书店一位受伤的职工向大家报告了他在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的情况。他说，“当我面对着二三百个法西斯豺狼的时候，我没有丝毫害怕，而是斗志昂扬。我看见一位战友被暴徒围住毒打时，想起了毛主席的教导：
  ‘一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助’，就勇敢地上去救援。暴徒立即转过来围攻我。他们揪住我的头发，用警棍猛击我的头和背，我虽然受了重伤，头上鲜血直冒，但是丝毫也不退缩，我的脑子里只有一个念头，就是按照毛主席的教导，站在自卫的立场上坚决回击来犯的法西斯暴徒。”
    各单位的职工代表在会上说：我们都是港英血腥镇压的受害者，是心连心的阶级亲兄弟。我们一定要团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。帝国主义越是仇视毛泽东思想，我们越是要宣传毛泽东思想，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照全球。
    在德信行、中孚行、华远公司等三个贸易单位举行的大会上，许多被港英法西斯暴徒毒打受伤的职工，甚至有些因重伤躺在床上不能起来的职工，都纷纷作了愤怒的控诉。
    职工们说，我们的正义斗争并不是孤立的，有毛主席做我们强大的靠山，有祖国七亿人民，有强大的人民解放军，有英勇的红卫兵小将作我们坚强的后盾，我们的斗争就一定能够取得胜利。英帝国主义欠下我们的血债，一定要偿还！
