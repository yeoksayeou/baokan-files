Our hearts' reddest sun, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, issued the "May 7th Directive" last year, which is a great development of Marxism-Leninism. This document illuminates the path from socialism to communism. This document points out the fundamental way to prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Over the past year, the glorious victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have vividly demonstrated the immense power of this brilliant document.

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to realize their plot to restore capitalism, were most afraid of us studying politics, most afraid of us criticizing the bourgeoisie, and most afraid of us caring about state affairs. Just at this time last year, in the struggle to criticize the "Three Family Village" anti-Party clique, we workers were filled with righteous indignation, took up the pen as our weapon, and actively joined the battle. However, the handful of capitalist-roaders within our factory tried to obstruct us. Some even publicly said, "You are workers, you can't criticize the 'Three Family Village,' just go back to your machines!" They treated us workers as mere talking tools. They wanted to cultivate workers into apolitical mediocrities, aiming to pave the way for their restoration of capitalism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao trusts and relies on the masses the most. He calls on workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres to all criticize the bourgeoisie. He calls on us to care about state affairs. He entrusts us with the glorious task of opposing revisionism and preventing restoration.

We revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have responded to the great leader's call, with everyone caring about state affairs. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have conducted the broadest and deepest criticism of the bourgeoisie. The working class and laboring people understand the evil of exploitation the best and have the most right to speak in criticizing the bourgeoisie. Our factory's revolutionary faction first participated in the battle to criticize the "Three Family Village," and then resolutely fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory party committee and the reactionary line implemented by the work team. We revolutionary masses not only overthrew the anti-Party, anti-socialist elements like Deng Tuo but also exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of agents of the bourgeoisie hiding within the Party, and dealt a unprecedented heavy blow to the bourgeois ideology.

What is particularly gratifying is that in this unprecedented great revolution, in this great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, countless revolutionary pioneers have emerged. The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, armed with the boundless flames of Mao Zedong Thought, are growing rapidly.

All this is a devastating blow to the plot of the counter-revolutionary revisionists to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the tempering of revolutionary storms and stresses." In the future, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, always care about state affairs, persist in studying politics, persist in criticizing the bourgeoisie, and in the storms of class struggle, cultivate a new generation of communists.

Now, our factory has established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, and the power of the entire factory is in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses. A new task is before us: How to consolidate our red political power? How to prevent the enterprise from taking the revisionist road? Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is our guiding light. Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is the great blueprint for building a new type of socialist enterprise.

Under the control of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" could not be implemented. Now that we proletarian revolutionary masses are in power, we will implement the great leader's great directive without any compromise. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, gradually turn the enterprise into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought, cultivate the workforce into an extremely proletarianized, extremely revolutionary, and extremely militant industrial army, and cultivate workers into new people who are both workers and peasants, both intellectuals and soldiers, and all-around developed.

    建设一支革命化的产业大军
    北京第二机床厂革命委员会负责人　傅德明
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，去年发出的“五·七”指示，是马克思列宁主义的伟大发展。这个文献照亮了由社会主义过渡到共产主义的道路。这个文献指出了防止资本主义复辟的根本途径。
    一年来，无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，生动地显示了这个光辉文献的巨大威力。
    过去，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了实现他们复辟资本主义的阴谋，最害怕我们学政治，最害怕我们批判资产阶级，最害怕我们关心国家大事。就在去年这个时候批判“三家村”反党集团的斗争中，我们工人满腔怒火，拿起笔作刀枪，积极投入了战斗。可是，我们厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，却竭力加以阻挠。有的家伙公然说：“你们是工人，批判不了‘三家村’，还是好好摇摇把去吧！”他们就是把我们工人当成会说话的工具。他们就是要把工人培养成不问政治的庸人，目的是要为他们复辟资本主义铺平道路。
  我们伟大领袖毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众。他老人家号召工农兵和革命师生、革命干部，都来批判资产阶级，他老人家号召我们要关心国家大事。他老人家把反修防修的光荣任务交给我们。
    我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，响应伟大领袖的号召，人人关心国家大事，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，对资产阶级进行了最广泛最深刻的批判。我们工人阶级和劳动人民最了解剥削的罪恶，对于批判资产阶级最有发言权。我们厂的革命派先是参加了批判“三家村”的战斗，接着对厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和工作组执行的资产阶级反动路线进行了坚决的斗争。我们无产阶级革命派不仅批倒了邓拓等反党反社会主义分子，而且揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揪出了隐藏在党内的一小撮资产阶级的代理人，并且对资产阶级的意识形态给予了空前沉重的打击。
    特别令人高兴的是，在这场史无前例的大革命中，在这场无产阶级同资产阶级的大搏斗中，涌现出了无数革命闯将。用光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命事业接班人在迅速成长。
    这一切，对于反革命修正主义分子复辟资本主义的阴谋是毁灭性的打击。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”今后，我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，永远关心国家大事，坚持学政治，坚持批判资产阶级，在阶级斗争的风浪中，培养共产主义的一代新人。
    现在，我们厂已经成立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，全厂大权已经掌握在无产阶级革命派手里。一个新的课题摆在我们面前：怎么样巩固我们的红色政权？怎么样防止企业走上修正主义的道路？毛主席的“五·七”指示，就是我们的指路明灯。毛主席的“五·七”指示，就是我们建设社会主义的新型企业的伟大纲领。
    在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，毛主席的“五·七”指示，不可能贯彻执行。如今，我们无产阶级革命派掌了权，我们就要不折不扣地实现伟大领袖的这一伟大指示。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，逐步把企业办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把工人队伍培养成非常无产阶级化、非常革命化、非常战斗化的产业大军，把工人培养成亦工亦农、亦文亦武、全面发展的新人。
