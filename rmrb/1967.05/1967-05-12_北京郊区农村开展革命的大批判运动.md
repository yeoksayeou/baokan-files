The Revolutionary Committee for Production in the Suburbs of Beijing recently held a political work meeting. The meeting emphasized the need to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, further achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on May 11 stated that the Revolutionary Committee for Production in the Suburbs of Beijing recently held a political work meeting. The meeting pointed out that the most important political task in the countryside at present is to quickly launch a mass movement of denunciation, exposure, criticism, and struggle against the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. This will further arouse the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres' class feelings of unlimited love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Chairman Mao, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. This is also the general direction of the current cultural revolution in the countryside.

The meeting believed that at present, a mass movement to thoroughly criticize the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party is vigorously developing in the suburbs of Beijing. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres are holding denunciation meetings, exposure meetings, and criticism meetings, combining the actual situations of their regions and units. They use a large number of living facts to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, which supported them, against the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Comrades from the Revolutionary Committee for Production in various counties (districts) at the meeting believed that overthrowing and exposing the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party is a decisive battle to carry the cultural revolution of the proletariat to the end and a decisive battle to ensure the complete victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They expressed that they must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "pursuing the enemy to the bitter end," organize a vast revolutionary army, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. They will thoroughly eliminate the poison of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party in rural issues, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage in the revolutionary criticism, further achieve the great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," defend the great achievements of the Four Clean-ups movement, and ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture.

Comrades attending the meeting pointed out that in launching the revolutionary criticism movement in the countryside, it is necessary to widely propagate the great significance of this revolutionary criticism movement among the masses, making it known to every household. Through propaganda and education, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants should realize that only by implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can we build socialism well, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our proletarian heaven will never change color. This is the central issue of the struggle between the two lines, relating to the future of China and the great cause of world revolution. Through extensive propaganda and education, the masses should truly be mobilized to consciously participate in the current criticism movement. The meeting required the broad revolutionary masses to further launch a new high tide of studying and applying the "Old Three Articles" in the criticism, and carry out a great revolution to criticize selfishness and establish public spirit. Through the criticism movement, Mao Zedong Thought should be thoroughly established, occupying every inch of the people's commune, and the countryside should be turned into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The meeting pointed out that in the revolutionary criticism, it is necessary to focus on the education of the two lines and class education, guiding the members and cadres to recall bitterness and think of sweetness. The people's liberation army soldiers who deeply entered the suburbs to support agriculture and support the leftists should denounce the bitterness of the old society together with the poor and lower-middle peasants and expose the crimes of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. Through denunciation, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their intense class hatred for the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party should be further aroused. The meeting especially emphasized that the criticism of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party must be combined with the destruction of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, thoroughly overthrowing the local clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, and closely combining it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the region and unit.

The meeting also emphasized that in the revolutionary criticism, it is necessary to better implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." All levels should strengthen the leadership of the criticism movement, placing it at the forefront of all work, using revolution to command production, and using revolution to promote production.

    彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的流毒
    北京郊区农村开展革命的大批判运动
    北京市抓革命促生产第一线指挥部召开政治工作会议，强调要把活学活用毛主席著作群众运动推向新阶段，进一步实现革命的大联合和“三结合”，保证农业生产丰收。
    新华社十一日讯　北京市抓革命促生产第一线指挥部最近召开的一次政治工作会议指出，当前农村工作中最大的政治就是要迅速掀起一个对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大控诉、大揭发、大批判、大斗争的群众运动，进一步激发广大贫下中农和各级干部对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜的阶级感情，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。这也是当前农村无产阶级文化大革命运动的大方向。
    这次会议认为，目前，一个群众性的彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的运动正在北京郊区农村蓬勃展开。广大贫下中农和革命干部高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，纷纷举行声讨会、控诉会和批判会，结合本地区、本单位的实际情况，用大量活生生的事实，揭发和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及得到他们支持的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团犯下的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。各县（区）抓革命促生产第一线指挥部的同志在会上认为，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决定性战役，是保证毛主席的无产阶级革命路线彻底胜利的决战。他们表示，一定要发扬“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的革命精神，组织浩浩荡荡的革命大军，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在农村问题上的流毒，在革命的大批判中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，进一步实现无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”，保卫四清运动的伟大成果，保证农业生产的丰收。
    到会的同志指出，在农村开展革命的大批判运动，首先要在群众中广泛宣传这次革命大批判运动的伟大意义，做到家喻户晓。要通过宣传教育，使广大贫下中农认识到，只有贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能建设好社会主义，才能巩固无产阶级专政，保证我们无产阶级的江山永不变色。这是两条路线斗争的中心问题，是关系到中国的前途，关系到世界革命的大事。要通过广泛宣传教育，真正把群众发动起来，自觉地投入到当前的大批判运动中去。会议要求广大革命群众在大批判中进一步掀起活学活用“老三篇”的新高潮，开展一场破私立公的大革命。要通过大批判运动，大立毛泽东思想，让毛泽东思想占领人民公社的每一寸土地，把农村办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    会议指出，在革命的大批判中，要大抓两条路线的教育和阶级教育，引导社员和干部忆苦思甜。深入到京郊支援农业、支援左派的人民解放军指战员，要和贫下中农一起大诉旧社会的苦，控诉党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。通过大控诉，更加激发起广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，以及对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派无比憎恨的阶级感情。会议特别强调，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，必须和摧毁旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，彻底打倒当地党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派结合起来，同本地区、本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来。
    会议还强调指出，在革命的大批判中，一定要更好地贯彻执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。各级要加强对大批判运动的领导，把它放在一切工作的首位，以革命统帅生产，用革命带动生产。
