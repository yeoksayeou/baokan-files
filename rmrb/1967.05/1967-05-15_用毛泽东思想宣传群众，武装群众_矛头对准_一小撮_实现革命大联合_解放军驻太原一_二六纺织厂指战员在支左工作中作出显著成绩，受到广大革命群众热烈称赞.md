The PLA's support team in Too-yuan No. 126 Textile Mill has made remarkable achievements in their leftist support work, earning the enthusiastic praise of the revolutionary masses. According to Xinhua News Agency, Too-yuan, May 14th: The PLA's Shanxi Provincial Military Region, stationed at Too-yuan No. 126 Textile Mill, has used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to propagate and arm the masses, guiding the deceived masses back to the path of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, and helping the mill achieve a revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core.

The united revolutionary masses unanimously praise the great contributions made by the PLA in the Cultural Revolution, launching a campaign to learn from the PLA, and together with the stationed soldiers, they are vigorously promoting the revolution and vigorously advancing production.

How did the stationed soldiers in Too-yuan No. 126 Textile Mill help the mill achieve a revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core? Their methods are as follows:

First, they guided the masses, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, to direct their spears at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, uniting under the premise of a consistent direction of struggle.

After the Cultural Revolution began, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party at Too-yuan No. 126 Textile Mill took advantage of the workers' eagerness to change the backward face of Too-yuan Textile Mill, spreading the lie that they must thoroughly expose the backward cover of Too-yuan Textile Mill in this movement to deceive the masses. They used their puppet organizations to attack a famous worker, Xiao Yue, who was an active learner of Chairman Mao's works. They stirred up trouble among the masses, saying, "Xiao Yue, although not a capitalist-roader, is even more dangerous than the capitalist-roaders. Only by pulling down Xiao Yue can the backward cover of eight years be exposed, and the Cultural Revolution in Too-yuan Textile Mill can be thoroughly carried out." This muddied the waters, and many masses were deceived.

On January 26th of this year, after the soldiers supported the leftists in seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party." They firmly believed that the majority of the masses wanted revolution, and with the broadest mind and the greatest patience, they enthusiastically and meticulously did ideological work among the deceived masses.

The stationed soldiers organized the workers to seriously study Chairman Mao's "Sixteen Points" and his teachings on "Communist Party members should question everything, think everything through in their minds, and see if it is in line with reality and if it is truly reasonable. They must not blindly follow and must not advocate slavishness." They asked everyone to think about the actual situation in the mill and question the slogan of "exposing the backward cover of eight years" and question why the spear of struggle was directed at Xiao Yue. When everyone used the phenomenon as a guide to enter the door and then grasped its essence, they suddenly realized. The "Sixteen Points" clearly states: The focus of this movement is to criticize the capitalist-roaders within the Party. But they were fighting the broad middle and lower-level cadres, fighting Xiao Yue, and fighting the masses against the masses, allowing the handful of capitalist-roaders to sit back and watch the fight. The soldiers also helped the deceived masses further analyze that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party proposed the slogan of "exposing the backward cover of eight years" because these people had been in the mill for a short time. Once they exposed the so-called "backward cover of eight years," they could shift the target of struggle, and they themselves could sneak away.

After exposing the enemy's tricks, the soldiers guided the masses to direct their spears at the "handful." In conjunction with the widespread movement to criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they held multiple struggle meetings to criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the mill. Through big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, wired broadcasts, distributing leaflets, and holding exhibitions, they exposed the evil deeds of these reactionaries. At the same time, they organized the deceived cadres and masses to "counterattack," exposing the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party through their puppet organizations in spreading economism. In this way, they fully exposed the ugly faces of these handful of people who were against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought in broad daylight, making many deceived masses see who the real enemy was and who the real class brothers were.

Second, they united the majority of cadres. After the revolutionary faction of Too-yuan No. 126 Textile Mill seized power, some revolutionary leading cadres came out, but the majority of cadres, due to making various mistakes or standing on the wrong side in the previous stage, were full of worries and fears; the revolutionary faction also had many opinions about them and was not willing to actively unite with them, even harboring suspicions. Facing these situations, the stationed soldiers organized the revolutionary faction and the masses to study Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, correct their attitudes towards cadres, and master the weapon of class analysis. They criticized the anarchist thoughts of "doubt everything, reject everything, and overthrow everything," making everyone realize: Only by "liberating a large area" can we thoroughly "isolate a handful." Some leftists were still not convinced and wanted the cadres who had made mistakes and "stood on the wrong side" to continue to stand aside. The stationed soldiers patiently helped them use the "Three Articles" as weapons to carry out a revolution in their souls, break down the "self" and establish the "public," and establish Mao Zedong Thought. They truly understood: For the revolutionary faction, rebellion is to uproot the root of revisionism and to create a red world.

For the cadres who had made mistakes and "stood on the wrong side," the soldiers specially organized them to study and carry out criticism and self-criticism, helping them recognize their mistakes, exposing problems, participating in the struggle, and creating conditions for them to correct their mistakes, making them quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Third, they firmly grasped living thoughts and removed obstacles to achieving revolutionary great unity from the perspective of thoughts and emotions. Through the fierce struggle, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, many deceived masses rushed to join the Too-yuan Red Guards. But some Red Guards took a rejection attitude, saying they were "diehards" and "iron sticks"; if they joined, "they would be like Sun Wukong entering the belly of the Iron Fan Princess, turning over our heaven." Some deceived masses felt: In the past, they opposed the Red Guards so much, and now they want to join their organization. First of all, they couldn't save face and were worried that others wouldn't trust them and would be discriminated against.

Facing these living thoughts, the stationed soldiers, according to Chairman Mao's teachings on "grasping ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to carry out great political struggles," held meetings in various workshops and teams for old workers from poor peasant backgrounds, demobilized soldiers, Party members, and League members, conducting ideological education based on their specific situations. They also held "knot-tying meetings" in classes and groups to exchange hearts and communicate thoughts.

For the leftists, they focused on making them realize that after seizing power, their status had changed, and they could not discriminate against the originally deceived masses. The responsibility for achieving a revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core mainly fell on the leftists. The soldiers mainly used the method of rectification to organize them to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on how to correctly treat backward people, raise the policy and ideological level of the leftists, and from the perspective of revolutionary interests, consider the overall situation, understand the big picture, not calculate personal grievances, and not regard themselves as heroes. They also proposed: Revolution does not distinguish between early and late, team members do not distinguish between old and new, unite as one, and jointly fight the enemy.

For the deceived masses, they mainly organized them to study Chairman Mao's teachings on how to treat mistakes, such as: "Communist Party members must be ready at any time to uphold the truth because any truth is in the interests of the people; Communist Party members must be ready at any time to correct mistakes because any mistake is not in the interests of the people." Through these educations, they corrected their attitudes, eliminated worries, did not calculate personal gains and losses, and not only in thought and emotion but also in organization and action, completely stood on the side of the leftists.

### 用毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众  矛头对准“一小撮”　实现革命大联合  解放军驻太原一·二六纺织厂指战员在支左工作中作出显著成绩，受到广大革命群众热烈称赞

    用毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众
    矛头对准“一小撮”　实现革命大联合
    解放军驻太原一·二六纺织厂指战员在支左工作中作出显著成绩，受到广大革命群众热烈称赞
    据新华社太原十四日电　中国人民解放军山西省军区在太原一·二六纺织厂担任支工任务的指战员，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想宣传群众，武装群众，使受蒙蔽的群众迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，帮助这个工厂实现了以左派为核心的革命大联合。
    团结起来的广大革命群众齐声称赞人民解放军在文化大革命中作出的伟大贡献，开展了向解放军学习的活动，并同驻厂指战员一起狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    驻太原一·二六纺织厂的指战员是怎样帮助这个厂实现以左派为核心的革命大联合的？他们的作法是：
    第一，按照毛主席的教导，引导广大群众把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在斗争大方向一致的前提下团结起来。
    文化大革命开始以后，太原一·二六纺织厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，利用广大职工群众迫切要求改变太纺落后面貌的心情，散布什么一定要在这次运动中彻底揭开太纺八年来的落后盖子，来欺骗群众。他们通过御用组织的一些头头们，对著名的学习毛主席著作积极分子、一个普通工人解悦同志大肆攻击。在群众中到处煽风点火，胡说什么“解悦虽然不是当权派，但比当权派还厉害。”“把解悦拉下马，八年的落后盖子才能揭开，太纺的文化大革命才能搞深搞透。”这一来，就把水搅浑了，许多群众受了蒙蔽。
    今年一月二十六日，指战员们支持左派夺了工厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，遵照毛主席关于“我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党”的教导，坚信群众大多数是要革命的，以最宽广的胸怀和最大的耐心，满腔热忱地对受蒙蔽的群众进行艰苦细致的思想工作。
    驻厂指战员组织广大职工认真学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”和毛主席关于“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义”的教导，要大家联系厂里的实际情况“想一想”，对“揭八年落后盖子”这一口号的提出，“问一个为什么”；对把斗争矛头指向解悦同志，“问一个为什么”。当大家把现象当作入门的向导，进而抓住它的本质以后，便恍然大悟了。“十六条”上写得明明白白：这次运动的重点是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。而自己斗的是广大的中下层干部，斗的是解悦同志，搞的是群众斗群众，让一小撮走资本主义道路当权派坐山观虎斗。指战员们还帮助受蒙蔽的群众进一步分析，厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，所以提出“揭八年落后盖子”的口号，是因为这些家伙来厂时间较晚，一揭所谓“八年落后盖子”，就可以转移斗争目标，他们自己就能偷偷溜掉。
    戳穿了敌人的阴谋诡计，指战员们就乘势引导群众，把斗争矛头指向“一小撮”。结合在全厂范围掀起的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，多次召开斗争本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大会，通过大字报、黑板报、有线广播、印发传单、举办展览等，揭发这一小撮反动家伙的罪恶事实。同时，还组织受过蒙蔽的干部和群众“杀回马枪”，揭露厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派通过他们的御用组织大搞经济主义的罪行。这样，就把这一小撮人反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的丑恶嘴脸，充分暴露在光天化日之下，使许多受蒙蔽的群众认清了谁是真正的敌人，谁是真正的阶级兄弟。
    第二，团结大多数干部。太原一·二六纺织厂革命派夺权以后，一些革命的领导干部纷纷“亮相”，但大多数干部由于犯有这种或那种错误，或在前一阶段“站错了队”，因而顾虑重重，“怕”字当头；而革命派对他们的意见也较大，不愿意积极争取团结他们，甚至对他们存有戒心。针对这些情况，驻厂指战员就组织革命派和广大群众，学习毛主席的干部政策，端正对待干部的态度，掌握阶级分析的武器，批判“怀疑一切、排斥一切、打倒一切”的无政府主义思想，使大家认识到：只有“解放一大片”，才能彻底“孤立一小撮”。左派中有些人还是不服气，想让犯了错误和“站错队”的干部继续靠边站。驻厂指战员便耐心地帮助他们以“老三篇”为武器，在灵魂深处闹革命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大立毛泽东思想。使他们真正懂得：对革命派说来，造反，是为了挖掉修正主义的根子，是为了造出一个红彤彤的世界。
    对犯了错误和“站错队”的干部，部队同志专门把他们组织起来学习，开展批评和自我批评，促进他们认识错误，发动他们揭发问题，参加斗争，给他们创造改正错误的条件，使他们迅速地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    第三，狠抓活思想，从思想感情上扫除实现革命大联合的障碍。通过狠揭狠批狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，许多受蒙蔽的群众纷纷要求加入太纺红卫队。但有些红卫队员就采取排斥态度，说他们是“死顽固”、“铁杆”；让他们入队，“就会象孙悟空钻进铁扇公主的肚子里，翻我们的天”。一些受过蒙蔽的群众，则觉得：过去那样反对红卫队，现在又要参加人家的组织，首先在脸面上拉不下来，担心人家信不过，受歧视。
    针对这些活思想，驻厂指战员按照毛主席关于“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，在各车间、工段，分别召开了贫下中农出身的老工人、复员军人、党团员等座谈会，针对他们的具体情况，进行思想教育。还以班、组为单位，召开“解疙瘩会”，互相交心，沟通思想。
    对于左派，着重使他们认识到，夺权以后，自己的地位变了，对原来受蒙蔽的群众，绝不能歧视他们。实现以左派为核心的革命大联合，主要责任落在左派身上。指战员们对他们主要采取整风的办法，组织他们认真学习毛主席正确对待落后人们的教导，提高左派的政策思想水平，从革命利益出发，顾大局，识大体，不计个人恩怨，不以功臣自居。他们还提出：革命不分先后，队员不分新老，团结一致，共同对敌。
    对于受蒙蔽的群众，主要组织他们学习毛主席关于怎样对待错误的教导。如：“共产党人必须随时准备坚持真理，因为任何真理都是符合于人民利益的；共产党人必须随时准备修正错误，因为任何错误都是不符合于人民利益的。”通过这些教育，使他们端正态度，消除顾虑，不计个人得失，不仅在思想上、感情上，而且在组织上、行动上，完全站到左派一边。
