The great historical significance of the Peking Opera revolution has made the stage of Chinese drama vibrant with spring, blooming with a cluster of vibrant flowers. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is the most brilliant among them.

This play was born and grown under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and the personal care and direct leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, amidst the fierce struggle between the revolutionary literary and artistic line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line. It sings the praises of Chairman Mao's great thought on people's war, creates brilliant images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and wins the enthusiastic praise of the revolutionary masses with its high political and ideological content and perfect artistic form. This is an unprecedented great play. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and a fatal blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line.

Chairman Mao said, "A just war is the highest honor to save mankind and save China, and it is the bridge that turns the history of the whole world to a new era." To depict the people's war and sing the praises of the people's war is a glorious task for proletarian literature and art.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is an unprecedented great play that depicts the people's war on the stage of drama and sings the praises of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and his correct line.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, a large number of cadres and troops of our Party went to Northeast China. How to carry out work and achieve revolutionary victory? At that time, there was a struggle between two lines. According to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we should "open the main road and occupy both sides," carry out arduous work to mobilize the masses, establish a solid base area, and surround the cities with the countryside. Comrade Lin Biao firmly implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist head of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, at that time implemented the capitulationist line proposed by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, opposed Comrade Lin Biao's correct proposal to establish a base area, did not make war preparations, and was infatuated with big cities and dreamed of peace. The struggle between the two lines on the Northeast battlefield at that time was actually a microcosm of the struggle between the two lines in the entire Chinese revolution.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" vividly recreates the majestic revolutionary historical facts on the Northeast battlefield under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line. It describes how a pursuit team of our army, in a situation where they are unfamiliar with the geography and local customs, carries out arduous and meticulous mass work, and reflects Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of establishing a solid base area in Northeast China by relying on the people and using Chairman Mao's strategies and tactics to eliminate the notorious bandit Seat-of-the-Tiger.

A pursuit team of only thirty-six people ventured into the forest and snow, aiming to capture Tiger Mountain, which has "nine groups and twenty-seven forts," and eliminate the numerically superior bandit gang of Seat-of-the-Tiger in a short period of time using the method of "taking by strategy." This is a thrilling battle. Such a play is very easy to pursue the legendary nature of the plot. This situation was not uncommon in past dramas and films. During the adaptation process of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," counter-revolutionary revisionists blew cold winds and shot dark arrows, attempting to pull it onto this wrong path. Their purpose was to oppose the main theme of highlighting the people's war. The proletarian revolutionary faction resolutely smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionists' plot and discarded this wrong approach, establishing the thrilling battle of taking Tiger Mountain by strategy on the basis of the power of the masses.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" embodies this brilliant thought of Chairman Mao. Especially in the third scene "Asking for Hardships in the Deep Mountains" and the seventh scene "Mobilizing the Masses," it vividly depicts the blood-and-flesh relationship between the people's army and the masses, and highlights the essence of our army coming from the people, relying on the people, and fighting completely for the liberation of the people.

In the scene "Asking for Hardships in the Deep Mountains," Chang Bao's "every word is blood, every sound is tears" accusation expresses the deep hatred of the masses towards the bandit gang of Seat-of-the-Tiger, arouses Yang Zirong's indignation, strengthens his determination to avenge the masses, and thus sets off the common class feelings of revolutionary soldiers and oppressed people, pointing out the just nature of our war. With the help of Chang Bao's father and daughter, Yang Zirong captured a small group of bandits, seized the "contact map," and found the dangerous path leading directly to the Tiger Hall from the back mountain, thus placing the "taking by strategy" of Tiger Mountain on a solid and reliable mass foundation, indicating the source of power for the revolutionary war.

In the scene "Mobilizing the Masses," the above-mentioned idea is further developed. The broad masses of Jiaji Gorge, represented by Li Yongqi, are in dire straits, "suppressing their anger and struggling in the bottomless abyss." They eagerly await the arrival of the savior. However, when the pursuit team enters Jiaji Gorge, the masses are still suspicious. Shao Jianbo and others patiently propagate the Party's policies and care for the sufferings of the masses. When Li Yongqi sees that the Liberation Army is sincerely loyal to the people, his doubts disappear, and he excitedly sings, "Today, we fight bandits, go deep into the mountains, save the poor, and free them from suffering. Our own troops have come to our faces!" The pursuit team also helps the masses to operate the forest small train, develop production, and organize the militia. In this way, the broad masses regard the revolutionary war as their own cause, turning their hatred for the enemy into a great force. They promise the combatants, "To catch the dragon with you into the deep sea, to fight the tiger with you up the high mountain." It is because of the wholehearted support of the masses that the pursuit team can fight powerfully with the bandit gang of Seat-of-the-Tiger, who has been entrenched in the vast forest and snow for a long time, achieve victory with fewer troops, and win by surprise.

Chairman Mao said: "The army must blend with the masses, so that the army is seen by the masses as their own army. Such an army will be invincible in the world." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" fully embodies this wise judgment of Chairman Mao.

The outstanding achievements of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" refute the various fallacies of counter-revolutionary revisionists on the issue of depicting war themes. Counter-revolutionary revisionists oppose the "smell of gunpowder," oppose singing the praises of the people's war. Even if they write about war, they only write about the wrong line, not about Chairman Mao's correct line, not about depicting the class nature and justice of the revolutionary war, but about exaggerating the horror and destructiveness of war, spreading bourgeois humanism and pacifism. Such dramas and literary works can only play a reactionary role in undermining the revolutionary will of the people and disarming the ideological weapons of the people.

"The gun is the source of power." It is precisely the gun that has created a red China. Without the gun, there would be nothing for the people. Our literature and art should write extensively about the people's war. Opposing the writing of the people's war is opposing the armed seizure of power and opposing the proletarian revolution. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" not only writes about the theme of revolutionary war but also enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao's thought on the people's war and vividly depicts the justice of the revolutionary war. It exposes the enemy's plunder and arson, but unlike bad plays and films that deliberately arrange the tragic fate of the protagonist, it emphasizes the people's resistance and the firm will to fight the enemy when exposing the enemy. It describes the hardships of the struggle, but unlike bad plays and films that exaggerate the hardships of war, it emphasizes the fearless and unyielding revolutionary heroism of revolutionary soldiers and the masses when describing the hardships of the struggle, and their great revolutionary spirit and revolutionary optimism. Because of this, it can play a great educational role in awakening and inspiring the people to unite as one and engage in revolutionary struggle, becoming a powerful weapon to unite the people and strike the enemy.

Revolutionary literature and art should create images of workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes, using their communist spirit to educate the people and encourage them to move forward.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" vividly and meticulously depicts the communist spirit and noble qualities of the hero Yang Zirong. Through Yang Zirong's brave act of entering the tiger's den alone and his long passages of singing revolutionary passion, as well as the surrounding characters' embellishment, he is vividly portrayed as having the red-hearted loyalty of "daring to rush forward even if it is a sea of fire and a mountain of knives," the communist spirit of "wishing the red flag to wave over the five continents and four seas," the heroic courage of "daring to rush through the forest of swords and the mountain of knives," and the amazing wisdom of remaining calm and turning danger into safety in the face of danger. Although Yang Zirong is dressed as a bandit going up the mountain, in the eyes of the audience, he is still a revolutionary hero. Although he is fighting alone against cunning and treacherous bandits, he is always proactive, and the stage is always dominated by righteousness over evil. What is written is Yang Zirong disguising as a bandit going up the mountain to "surrender," but through the tiger-fighting and a conversation with Big Pockmarked, it is completely Yang Zirong who is superior to Big Pockmarked and other bandits, striding forward and leading them by the nose; what is written is Yang Zirong "presenting the map" to Seat-of-the-Tiger, but he uses Seat-of-the-Tiger's eagerness to obtain the "contact map" and his stupidity to confuse the bandits and make them spin around; what is written is Seat-of-the-Tiger using tricks to test Yang Zirong, but Yang Zirong turns the tables and further confuses the enemy, sending out intelligence. Even when Lan Ping suddenly appears on the mountain and Yang Zirong faces danger, he remains fearless and takes the initiative to attack, overwhelming Lan Ping with his high revolutionary spirit. All of this shows that he is a perfect and extraordinarily great proletarian hero.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is not just about writing Yang Zirong's bravery and strength, but about highlighting the source of this bravery and strength, writing that he is nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and has a deep class foundation. The drama, through Shao Jianbo, introduces his bitter family history and his revolutionary experience of "risking his life and building merit for the revolution." At the same time, it shows that the class hatred of the masses makes him even more determined to fight for the liberation of the oppressed people; it shows that Mao Zedong Thought gives him boundless strength, and he can "resist the cold and melt the snow" because he has "sunshine in his heart."

Yang Zirong's wisdom is not out of thin air but comes from Mao Zedong Thought and the wisdom of the masses. In the scene "Planning," Shao Jianbo, Yang Zirong, and others, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "in strategy, we must despise all enemies, and in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously," conduct careful investigations and research and analyze the situation, think deeply, and after Na Sun Da holds a democratic meeting for full discussion, everyone unanimously concludes that "to achieve victory, taking by strategy is the best," and collectively formulates the battle plan. This writes that our army is a collective of joint strategy and force, and Yang Zirong, "although he ventures into the tiger's den alone, has millions of class brothers by his side." In this way, when Yang Zirong strides up Tiger Mountain alone, it is clear that the hero comes from the masses and has the entire collective as his strong support.

In creating the image of the hero Shao Jianbo, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has also invested a great deal of effort. It writes about a commander who uses Chairman Mao's thought on the people's war, fully mobilizes the masses, and is good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses, and his revolutionary qualities of driving the development and changes of war under difficult and harsh conditions. In addition, it powerfully writes about the heroic images of the masses such as Li Yongqi, Chang Bao, and Na Sun Da.

The images of heroes such as Yang Zirong and Shao Jianbo created by "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" are typical proletarian heroes. The representatives of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line oppose the creation of proletarian hero images and advocate writing so-called "intermediate figures," which are actually backward and reactionary figures. Sometimes they have to say a few words about writing hero figures, but they emphasize writing the "flaws" of heroes and their "dark sides," otherwise it would be unrealistic. For Yang Zirong, they once used the excuse of realism to advocate highlighting his "rudeness and roughness" and bandit-like behavior. This fallacy exposes their standing on the reactionary position of the bourgeoisie and their intention to defame the image of proletarian revolutionary heroes.

Chairman Mao said, the life reflected in literary and artistic works "can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, and more ideal, and therefore more universal." Heroes like Yang Zirong in our country, under the nurturing of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are in the tens of thousands. The Yang Zirong on the stage of drama is only a concentrated representative of countless heroes in real life. He comes from real life and is higher than real life. He is a living artistic image that concentrates the excellent qualities of countless heroes. Because of this, he is completely realistic and more typical and idealized. Also because of this, he has become a model for the broad masses to learn from.

"Counting the heroes of the past, let's look at today." Heroes like Yang Zirong have taken the stage, making all the so-called heroes and heroes of history pale in comparison, and the emperors and generals who once dominated the stage will inevitably fall to the ground like Seat-of-the-Tiger.

The outstanding achievements of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" are first of all that it has a revolutionary political and ideological content and can well serve the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, serve Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At the same time, it has opened up a new path in the innovation and inheritance of Peking Opera art.

Peking Opera art, although it has achieved a relatively high level of art, has long been serving the landlord and bourgeoisie, depicting emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and forming a set of fixed formulas. If it is not reformed, it cannot depict the new society and new people. Therefore, to make Peking Opera depict workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve socialism, it must be revolutionary and innovative.

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, however, blathers about how "Peking Opera art has a high level and should not be despised or changed at will," and does not allow people to touch it. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their followers also shout and argue behind them, emphasizing that "Peking Opera is Peking Opera" and not allowing revolution.

"Without destruction, there is no construction; without dredging, there is no flow; without stopping, there is no progress." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is "breaking" first and foremost, daring to break through the old frameworks and old formulas of Peking Opera, daring to establish socialism and establish the peculiarity of the proletariat, making important contributions to the innovation and inheritance of Peking Opera art. It adheres to starting from real life and from political and ideological content, breaking through the old Peking Opera's role restrictions, and resolutely discarding those artistic forms that are only suitable for depicting the magnificent positions of emperors and generals and the so-called elegance, as well as the light and floating tunes that express the leisure and ease of feudal officials and scholars. At the same time, it mobilizes various useful artistic forms to serve the creation of heroic images. It fully uses the passionate tunes in Peking Opera, rich music, and creates a set of layered and beautiful tunes to express the revolutionary passion of heroes, depict their spiritual world, and create brilliant musical images. This play uses the artistic exaggeration method of Peking Opera, and in the stage arrangement, it highlights the confrontation between positive and negative characters, highlighting the greatness of heroes from the contrast. This play also learns from other arts (such as modern music and dance), creating many new forms to express revolutionary content. Yang Zirong's horse-riding dance up the mountain absorbs the horse-riding movements from Mongolian dance, and the pursuit team's skiing march dance and the final bayonet charge movements are also created based on the life of the troops, borrowing from modern dance movements. In short, whether it is the design of the tunes, the arrangement of the stage, the performance of the characters, or the details such as lighting and scenery, all start from life and serve the basic premise of expressing revolutionary political content.

Chairman Mao said: "For the artistic forms of the past era, we do not reject their use, but these old forms, when they fall into our hands, are transformed and new content is added, thus becoming revolutionary things that serve the people." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" practices this teaching of Chairman Mao, setting a brilliant example for the revolution of Peking Opera and the revolution of all old artistic forms.

Different classes have different views on "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." The broad revolutionary masses believe that it not only has good political content but also has a high artistic level. However, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their followers attack this play as having no flavor. This is not surprising, as the evaluation of artistic quality has always been a matter of class standards. Chairman Mao said: "The bourgeoisie, regardless of the artistic achievements of the literary and artistic works of the proletariat, always rejects them." In the eyes of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, only those that erect monuments to emperors and generals, beautify traitors, write about the joys and sorrows of scholars and beauties, and propagate vulgar sentiments have "drama," have "art," and have flavor. And this "art" is precisely the poison and opium that corrupts people's souls. For the proletariat, only those artistic forms that truly depict the fiery struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and those music, tunes, dances, and actions that fully express the sublime thoughts and feelings of proletarian heroes have the most artistic quality and the most flavor. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has achieved very high achievements in this regard and is loved by the broad revolutionary masses.

The struggle around "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and other revolutionary modern operas on the Peking Opera stage is a fierce struggle between two classes and two lines, and is one aspect of the struggle between restoration and anti-restoration in the socialist period. Counter-revolutionary revisionists and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who support them oppose the revolution of Peking Opera. Their evil intention is to use the Peking Opera stage to spread the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism, destroy the economic foundation of socialism, and prepare public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. Revolutionary Peking Opera, like other revolutionary arts, is to inspire the fighting spirit of the people, arouse the revolutionary spirit of the people, and serve to consolidate the economic foundation of socialism and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art are all for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" expresses the workers, peasants, and soldiers from the height of Mao Zedong Thought, and through artistic images, uses Mao Zedong Thought to educate the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making the Peking Opera stage a vivid classroom for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, making Peking Opera art a powerful weapon for consolidating the economic foundation of socialism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolution of Peking Opera opened the curtain of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is an important part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The appearance of revolutionary modern operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has promoted the revolution of the entire literature and art, providing excellent models for "struggle, criticism, and transformation" for the various battlefields of proletarian literature and art and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Jiang Qing said: The revolution of Peking Opera "is a serious class struggle and a very meticulous and quite difficult task." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has achieved such outstanding results in a short few years, which is the result of Comrade Jiang Qing leading the revolutionary comrades of the Shanghai Peking Opera Troupe to grasp the correct direction, forge ahead, and display the tenacious fighting spirit of the proletariat, continuously revise and refine, and repeatedly temper. The experience of adaptation and performance of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" tells us that as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, persist in working hard on creation and performance, we can overcome any difficulty and climb the peak of stage art.

    赞京剧革命现代戏《智取威虎山》
    洪平
    具有伟大历史意义的京剧革命，使我国的戏剧舞台春意盎然，开出了一簇鲜艳的花朵。《智取威虎山》就是其中最灿烂的一朵。
    这出戏，是在毛主席革命文艺路线与反革命修正主义文艺路线的激烈斗争中，在江青同志亲切关怀和直接指导下，经过革命文艺工作者的努力，诞生和成长起来的。《智取威虎山》歌颂了毛主席的伟大的人民战争思想，塑造了光辉的工农兵英雄形象，以其高度的政治思想内容和完美的艺术形式，赢得了革命群众的热烈赞扬。这是开天辟地以来的一个好戏。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是对反革命修正主义文艺路线的致命打击。
    一
    毛主席说，正义的战争，“是拯救人类拯救中国的至高无上的荣誉的事业，是把全世界历史转到新时代的桥梁”。表现人民战争，歌颂人民战争，是无产阶级文艺的一个光荣任务。
    《智取威虎山》是戏剧舞台上表现人民战争，歌颂毛主席的人民战争思想，歌颂毛主席的正确路线的空前未有的好戏。
    抗日战争胜利后，我党大批干部和军队初到东北，怎样开展工作，夺取革命胜利？当时存在着两条路线的斗争。按照毛主席的革命路线，应该是“让开大路，占领两厢”，进行艰苦的发动群众的工作，建立巩固的根据地，以农村包围城市。林彪同志坚决执行了毛主席的革命路线。而旧北京市委反革命修正主义头子彭真，当时却执行党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出的投降主义路线，反对林彪同志建立根据地的正确主张，不作战争打算，迷恋大城市，幻想和平。当时东北战场上两条路线的斗争，实际是整个中国革命中两条路线斗争的缩影。
    《智取威虎山》，以生动感人的艺术形象，再现了当时东北战场上在毛主席正确路线指导下的威武雄壮的革命史实。它描写了我军一个追剿队，在地理民情不熟的情况下进行艰苦细致的群众工作，表现了追剿队依靠人民，运用毛主席的战略战术，剿灭惯匪座山雕的斗争，集中地反映了毛主席关于建立巩固的东北根据地的伟大战略思想。
    一个只有三十六人的追剿队，深入林海雪原，要在很短的时间内，用“智取”的办法，拿下有“九群二十七地堡”，防守严密的威虎山，剿灭数量上占优势的座山雕匪帮，这是一场惊险的战斗。这样的戏，很容易追求故事情节上的传奇性。这种情形，在过去的戏剧和电影中，是屡见不鲜的。在《智取威虎山》的改编过程中，反革命修正主义分子吹冷风，放暗箭，妄图把它拉到这条邪路上去。其目的，就是为了反对突出人民战争的主题思想。无产阶级革命派坚决地粉碎了反革命修正主义分子的阴谋，摒弃了这种错误的做法，把智取威虎山这场惊险的战斗，建立在群众力量的基础之上。
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”《智取威虎山》体现了毛主席的这个光辉思想。特别是第三场“深山问苦”和第七场“发动群众”，更是绘声绘色地写出了人民军队和人民群众之间的血肉关系，突出地刻画了我们的军队来自人民、依靠人民、完全为着解放人民而战斗的本质。
    在“深山问苦”一场中，常宝“字字血、声声泪”的控诉，表达了人民群众对座山雕匪帮的深仇大恨，激起了杨子荣满腔怒火，增强了他为群众报仇的决心，从而烘托出了革命战士和被压迫人民共同的阶级感情，点出了我们战争的正义性质。杨子荣在常宝父女的帮助下，追捕了一撮毛，缴获了“联络图”，找到了后山直通威虎厅的险道，就把智取威虎山的“智取”，放在坚实可靠的群众基础之上，表明了革命战争的力量源泉。
    到“发动群众”一场，上述思想就进一步展开了。以李勇奇为代表的夹皮沟广大群众，身处绝境，“强按怒火，挣扎在无底深渊”。他们望眼欲穿地盼望着救星的到来。可是，追剿队刚进夹皮沟，群众还在疑虑。少剑波等耐心地宣传党的政策，关心群众的疾苦。当李勇奇看到解放军处处赤胆忠心为人民时，疑云顿消，激动地唱出：“今日里打土匪、进深山、救穷人、脱苦难、自己的队伍来到面前！”追剿队还帮助群众开动了森林小火车，发展了生产，组织了民兵。这样，就使广大群众把革命战争看作自己的切身事业，把他们对敌人的仇恨，化成了巨大的力量。他们向指战员保证：“擒龙跟你下大海，打虎随你上高山。”正是因为有群众的这种全心全意的支持，追剿队才能在茫茫林海雪原中，有力地与长期盘踞在那里的座山雕匪帮进行战斗，以少胜多，出奇制胜。
    毛主席说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。《智取威虎山》充分体现了毛主席的这个英明论断。
    《智取威虎山》的出色成就，驳斥了反革命修正主义分子在表现战争题材问题上的种种谬论。反革命修正主义分子大反“火药味”，反对歌颂人民战争。即使写战争，他们也是专写错误路线，不写毛主席的正确路线，不去表现革命战争的阶级性和正义性，而极力渲染战争的恐怖和破坏性，散布资产阶级的人性论和和平主义。这样的戏剧，这样的文艺作品，只能起瓦解人民的革命斗志，解除人民思想武装的反动作用。
    “枪杆子里面出政权”。正是枪杆子，打出了一个红彤彤的新中国。没有枪杆子，就没有人民的一切。我们的文艺，就应该大写特写人民战争。反对写人民战争，就是反对武装夺取政权，反对无产阶级革命。《智取威虎山》不仅写了革命战争的题材，而且热烈地颂扬了毛主席的人民战争思想，鲜明地表现了革命战争的正义性。它揭露了敌人的掠夺和烧杀，但是同渲染战争的恐怖、故意安排主人公的悲剧命运的坏戏坏电影相反，它在揭露敌人时，着重地写出了人民的反抗，和奋力杀敌人的坚强意志。它描写了斗争的艰苦性，但是同渲染战争的苦难的坏戏坏电影相反，它在描写斗争的艰苦性时，着重地表现了革命战士和人民群众不畏艰险一往无前的革命英雄主义气概，表现了他们伟大的革命胸怀和革命乐观主义精神。正因为这样，它就能够起到使人民群众惊醒起来，感奋起来，同心同德地进行革命斗争的巨大教育作用，成为团结人民、打击敌人的有力武器。
    二
    革命的文艺，应该塑造工农兵的英雄形象，用他们的共产主义精神，教育人民，鼓励人民前进。
    《智取威虎山》以热情洋溢的笔调，集中地、细致地刻画了杨子荣这个英雄人物的共产主义精神面貌和高贵品质。通过杨子荣只身入虎穴的英勇行为和他抒发革命豪情的大段唱词，以及周围人物的烘托，栩栩如生地表现了他为革命“那怕是火海刀山也扑上前”的赤胆忠心，“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展”的共产主义胸怀，“刀丛剑树也要闯”的英勇气概，以及遇艰险镇静自若、化险为夷的惊人智慧。杨子荣扮匪上山，打进匪窟，虽然是穿的土匪服装，但在观众眼里仍然是一个革命英雄。虽然是一个人在与阴险狡猾的匪徒们较量，但是他处处主动，舞台上始终是正气压倒邪气。写的是杨子荣扮成土匪上山“投靠”，但通过打虎以及与大麻子的一段对话，完全是杨子荣凌驾于大麻子等匪徒之上，昂首阔步地牵着他们的鼻子走；写的是杨子荣向座山雕“献图”，但他却利用座山雕迫不及待地想得到“联络图”这种利令智昏的精神状态，居高临下，耍弄得匪徒们团团打转；写的是座山雕施诡计试探杨子荣，但杨子荣却将计就计，进一步迷惑了敌人，送出了情报。就是在栾平突然上山，杨子荣面临险境的情况下，他临危不惧，主动进攻，以高度的革命气势压倒了栾平。所有这些，都表明了他是一个完美的异常高大的无产阶级英雄。
    《智取威虎山》并不是单纯地写杨子荣的英勇刚强，而是突出地表现了这种英勇刚强的力量源泉，写出了他是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，是有深厚的阶级基础的。戏剧通过少剑波介绍出他苦大仇深的家史和为革命“出生入死屡建勋劳”的革命经历。同时，表现了群众的阶级仇恨使他更加增强了为解放被压迫人民而奋斗的决心；表现了毛泽东思想给了他无穷的力量，他所以能够“抗严寒化冰雪”，是因为“胸有朝阳”。
    杨子荣的机智，不是凭空而来的，而是来源于毛泽东思想，来源于群众的智慧。“定计”一场，少剑波、杨子荣等根据毛主席关于“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人”的教导，经过仔细的调查研究和分析形势，深思熟虑，又经过孙达得召开民主会进行充分的讨论，大家不谋而合地得出了“欲制胜以智取为高”的结论，集体制定了作战方案。这就写出了我们军队是一个群策群力的战斗集体，而杨子荣“虽然是只身把龙潭虎穴闯，千百万阶级弟兄犹如在身旁”。这样，在杨子荣单枪匹马雄赳赳地走上威虎山时，就使人明显地感觉到英雄从群众中来，有整个集体作为他的坚强后盾。
    《智取威虎山》在塑造少剑波的英雄形象方面，也花了巨大功夫。写出了一个指挥员运用毛主席人民战争思想，充分发动群众，善于集中群众智慧的革命品质，和他在艰难困苦的条件下驾驭战争发展变化的能力。此外，还有力地写出了象李勇奇、常宝、孙达得等这些军民的英雄群像。
    《智取威虎山》所塑造的杨子荣、少剑波等英雄形象，是无产阶级英雄人物的典型。反革命修正主义文艺路线的代表人物，反对塑造无产阶级英雄形象，主张写所谓“中间人物”，实际上是写落后人物和反动人物。他们有时口头上也不得不说几句要写英雄人物的话，但是，又强调要写英雄的“缺点”，写他们内心的“阴暗面”，否则就是不真实。对于杨子荣，他们就曾以真实性为借口，主张突出表现他的“骠悍粗犷”、匪里匪气。这种谬论，暴露了他们站在资产阶级反动立场上，丑化无产阶级革命英雄的形象。
    毛主席说，文艺作品中反映出来的生活，“可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性”。象杨子荣这样的英雄人物，在我们国家里，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育下，是成千上万的。戏剧舞台上的杨子荣，不过是现实生活中无数英雄的集中代表。他来自现实生活，又高于现实生活。他是集中地反映了无数英雄人物的优秀品质的活生生的艺术形象。正因为这样，他是完全真实的，又是更富有典型性，更理想化的。也正因为这样，他才成为广大群众学习的榜样。
    “数风流人物，还看今朝。”杨子荣这样的高大英雄人物登上了舞台，就使历史上的一切所谓英雄豪杰黯然失色，那舞台上嚣张一时的帝王将相，就必不可免地要象座山雕一样，纷纷跌倒尘埃了。
    三
    《智取威虎山》的卓越成就，首先在于它有革命的政治思想内容，能够很好地为无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政服务，为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线服务。同时，在京剧艺术的创新和继承问题上，开创了新的道路。
    京剧艺术，虽然有比较高的艺术成就，但是它长期以来一直为地主资产阶级服务，表现帝王将相、才子佳人，形成了一套固定的程式，如果不加以改造，就根本不能表现新社会、新人物。因此，要使京剧表现工农兵，为社会主义服务，必须革命，必须创新。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，却胡说什么“京剧艺术水平很高，不能轻视，不能乱改”，不准人们去动一动。一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其追随者，也跟在后面吵吵嚷嚷，强调什么“京剧姓京”，不准革命。
    “不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。《智取威虎山》就是“破”字当头，大胆突破了京剧的老框框，旧程式，敢于标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，在京剧艺术的创新和继承上为我们做出了重要贡献。它坚持从现实生活出发，从政治思想内容出发，突破了旧京戏的行当限制，对于只适宜于表现帝王将相的显赫地位和所谓风度的那些艺术形式，以及抒发封建官吏和封建文人闲情逸致的那些轻飘飘的唱腔，坚决加以摒弃。同时，调动各种有用的艺术形式，来为塑造英雄形象服务。充分采用了京剧中激昂的唱腔，丰富的音乐，创造了成套的、有层次的、优美的唱腔，来抒发英雄的革命豪情，表现他们的精神世界，塑造了光辉的音乐形象。这出戏运用了京剧的艺术夸张手法，在舞台调度上突出表现了正面人物和反面人物的对立，从对比中衬托出英雄的高大。这出戏还借鉴其他艺术（如现代音乐和舞蹈），创造了许多表现革命内容的新形式，杨子荣骑马上山的舞蹈，就吸收了蒙古舞中骑马的动作，追剿队滑雪进军的舞蹈和最后拚刺刀的动作，也是根据部队的生活，借鉴了现代舞蹈的动作创造出来的。总之，无论唱腔的设计，舞台的调度，人物的表演，以至灯光、布景等等每一个细节，无不从生活出发，服从于表现革命的政治内容这一基本前提。
    毛主席说：“对于过去时代的文艺形式，我们也并不拒绝利用，但这些旧形式到了我们手里，给了改造，加进了新内容，也就变成革命的为人民服务的东西了。”《智取威虎山》实践了毛主席的这一教导，为京剧革命乃至一切旧的艺术形式的革命，树立了光辉的榜样。
    不同的阶级对《智取威虎山》有不同的看法。广大革命群众认为，它不仅政治内容很好，而且艺术水平很高。而一小撮反革命修正主义分子以及他们的追随者，却攻击这出戏没有味道。一点也不奇怪，对艺术性的评价从来是有阶级标准的。毛主席说：“资产阶级对于无产阶级的文学艺术作品，不管其艺术成就怎样高，总是排斥的。”在一小撮反革命修正主义分子看来，只有为帝王将相树碑立传，美化叛徒，写才子佳人的悲欢离合，宣扬低级情调，才有“戏”，才有“艺术”，才有味道。而这种“艺术”，正是腐蚀人们灵魂的毒药和鸦片。对无产阶级来说，只有真实地表现了工农兵火热斗争的艺术形式，只有充分地表现了无产阶级英雄崇高思想感情的音乐、唱腔、舞蹈、动作，等等，才最有艺术性，才最有味道。《智取威虎山》正是在这一方面取得了很高的成就，而为广大的革命群众所喜爱。
    京戏舞台上围绕着《智取威虎山》等革命现代戏的斗争，是两个阶级、两条路线的激烈斗争，是社会主义时期复辟和反复辟斗争的一个方面。反革命修正主义分子和支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，反对京剧革命，其罪恶企图就是要通过京剧舞台散布反革命修正主义的毒素，破坏社会主义的经济基础，为他们复辟资本主义作舆论准备。而革命的京剧，同其他革命文艺一样，则是鼓舞人民的斗志，激发人民的革命精神，为巩固社会主义的经济基础、巩固无产阶级专政服务的。
    毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”《智取威虎山》从毛泽东思想的高度去表现工农兵，从而通过艺术形象以毛泽东思想去教育工农兵，使京剧舞台成为宣传毛泽东思想的一个生动课堂，使京剧艺术成为巩固社会主义经济基础、巩固无产阶级专政的有力武器。
    京剧革命，揭开了无产阶级文化大革命的序幕，是无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要组成部分。《智取威虎山》等革命现代戏的出现，推动了整个文学艺术的革命，为无产阶级文艺，为无产阶级文化大革命各个阵地，提供了“斗批改”的优秀样板。
    江青同志说：京剧革命，“这是一场严重的阶级斗争，又是一件非常细致、相当困难的工作”。《智取威虎山》在短短的几年时间内，取得了这样优异的成就，是江青同志领导上海京剧院的革命同志，掌握正确的方向，披荆斩棘，发扬无产阶级的战斗韧性，不断加工修改，反复锤炼的结果。《智取威虎山》的改编和演出的经验告诉我们，只要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持不懈地在创作和演出上狠下功夫，就能够攻破任何难关，攀登舞台艺术上的高峰。
