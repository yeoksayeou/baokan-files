Mao Zedong's great document "On the Question of Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" has become more and more dear to us the more we read it. We feel that Chairman Mao is truly our dear leader who understands the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants.

The public screening of the film "The Life of Wu Xun" took place just after the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship. At that time, land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries were underway, and the proletariat was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the bourgeoisie and the landlord class. However, the authors of "The Life of Wu Xun" and the big shots who supported its screening, through their praise of the corpse of Wu Xun, slandered the peasant revolutionary movement, using the failure of the peasant struggle as a contrast to fervently advocate class capitulationism and slavism. They attempted to use this film to poison us: "Don't bother with land reform; if peasants want to rise up, they should beg the landlords."

Our great leader Chairman Mao saw through the schemes of these bad elements and called on revolutionary people to criticize the film "The Life of Wu Xun," thus exposing the plot of this group of bad elements to restore capitalism in China. Our great savior Chairman Mao once again stood up for us poor and lower-middle peasants.

In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and exploited because the political power was not in the hands of the proletariat. Our great leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people in a long armed struggle, seizing power. Only then did we poor and lower-middle peasants stand up and become masters of our own fate. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Zhou Yang, Lin Mofan, Qi Yanming, and Xia Yan, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, went to great lengths to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, attempting to restore capitalism in China and let the landlords ride roughshod over us poor and lower-middle peasants again. Let me tell you, that is absolutely impossible! We have seized all political and cultural powers from you and firmly grasped them in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Your tricks are completely finished!

Last year at this time, we poor and lower-middle peasants wanted to criticize the film "Early Spring in February," but a small clique of capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party shook their heads and said to us, "With your little bit of education, you're not even enough to be a cat's drink, how can you do criticism? Criticism is something done by people with great learning. If you're not afraid of hard work, go pick some more green onions for me!" They blocked us. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, giving us support. We rebelled against the capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party, and no one dared to stop us from criticizing the ghosts and snakes in the literary and artistic circles. Now, after studying "On the Question of Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," we have an even deeper understanding that we must actively join the struggle to criticize the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party and fight to the end without any compromise!

We poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to occupy the cultural front in the countryside with Mao Zedong Thought. The unified revolutionary mass organization—the Revolutionary Rebel Committee—formed by all revolutionary mass organizations in the entire brigade, has already organized several Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams, which often perform art programs propagating Mao Zedong Thought for the community members and are welcomed by the masses.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You understand us poor and lower-middle peasants the best, and you support us the most in our revolutionary struggles. We will definitely follow your instruction to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We will firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, "grasp revolution and promote production," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside through to the end!

    休想复辟资本主义

    毛主席的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》这个伟大文献，我们越读越感到亲切，越读越感到毛主席是咱们贫下中农的知心人。
    电影《武训传》的公开放映，是在无产阶级政权刚刚建立不久。那时，国内正在开展土地改革和镇压反革命运动，无产阶级正和资产阶级、封建地主阶级进行着你死我活的斗争。可是，电影《武训传》的作者和支持放映这部坏电影的“大人物”，却通过歌颂武训这具死尸，污蔑农民革命运动，用农民斗争的失败来作反衬，狂热地鼓吹阶级投降主义、奴隶主义。他们企图通过这部影片向我们放毒：土改甭搞了，农民要想翻身，就向地主乞求吧。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席看出了那些坏家伙的心眼，号召革命人民起来批判电影《武训传》，这就戳穿了这批坏家伙在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋。我们的大救星毛主席，又一次给咱贫下中农撑了腰。
    我们贫下中农在旧社会里受压迫、受剥削，就是因为政权没有在无产阶级手里。伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党，领导中国人民进行长期的武装斗争，取得了政权。我们贫下中农才翻身做了主人。可是，周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍等反革命修正主义分子，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，千方百计制造反革命舆论，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，让地主老财重新骑在我们贫下中农头上。告诉你们，那是绝对办不到的！我们从你们手里把政治、文化等一切大权夺了回来，牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，你们的把戏就彻底完蛋了！
    前年这个时候，我们贫下中农要批判电影《早春二月》，可是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，摇头晃脑地对我们说：“就你们那点文化水，还不够猫喝的，能搞批判？搞批判，那是有大学问的人干的事。你们不怕累，给我多拔两畦小葱！”横加阻拦。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命给我们撑了腰，我们造了党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，再没有人敢阻止我们批判文艺界的牛鬼蛇神了。现在，我们学习《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》以后，更加认识到应当积极地投入到批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中去，不获全胜决不收兵！
    我们贫下中农下决心要用毛泽东思想去占领农村文化阵地。全大队各革命群众组织联合组成的统一的革命群众组织——革命造反委员会，已经组织了几个毛泽东思想文艺宣传组，经常给社员演出宣传毛泽东思想的文艺节目，受到了群众的欢迎。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最了解我们贫下中农，您最支持我们进行革命斗争。我们一定遵照您的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，“抓革命，促生产”，把农村的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
