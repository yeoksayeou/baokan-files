The South Vietnamese Liberation Army fiercely bombarded the Phu Bai U.S. military airfield and the command center of the U.S. Marine Corps' Third Division stationed there in the early hours of April 28. According to initial reports, over 130 American aggressors were killed or wounded, including many officers and pilots. More than 50 enemy aircraft were destroyed. The command system of the airfield suffered severe damage, and almost all U.S. military barracks were demolished.

The enemy, caught off guard, panicked. U.S. troops on patrol rushed back to the airfield, while the guards, disoriented, fired indiscriminately, killing and wounding several of their own. This was the second attack by the liberation forces of Thua Thien Province on Phu Bai Airfield this year. The attack rendered this important U.S. military airfield paralyzed. To cover up their losses, the American aggressors ordered a ban on anyone entering or leaving the airfield after the attack.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the military and civilians of the New An-Ha Tinh region bravely repelled a large-scale "sweeping" operation by U.S. and puppet forces from April 9 to 20. They annihilated over 1,000 U.S. aggressors and 100 puppet soldiers, destroyed, shot down, and damaged 25 enemy aircraft, destroyed 5 military vehicles and two 155mm howitzers, and seized a large amount of military supplies.

The report said that from April 9 to 20, the U.S. aggressors mobilized two regiments and several main force battalions of puppet soldiers, totaling more than 10,000 troops, with air, armored, and naval support, launching a large-scale "sweeping" operation in the Dong My River and Tay My River basins, targeting several communes in the counties of Bien Hoa, Hau Thinh, De Hoa, Tan Chu, and Cam De. They were met with fierce resistance from local military and civilian forces.

The guerrilla forces in various communes used landmines, traps, and other simple weapons, employing flexible tactics such as encirclement, ambush, interception, and surprise attacks to deal heavy blows to the enemy, annihilating a large number of enemy troops. The guerrilla forces in Hau Thinh Commune, De Hoa County, tightly pinned down the enemy before they could establish a foothold, annihilating 250 U.S. aggressors and shooting down 10 helicopters in just eight days from April 9 to 16. The guerrilla forces in Bien Hoa County's Long Hoa Commune also repelled several enemy attacks during the same period, skillfully luring the enemy into minefields, annihilating over 240 U.S. aggressors, destroying 3 enemy helicopters, and damaging 4 more. The guerrilla forces in Tan Chu and Cam De counties also frequently launched attacks, annihilating 250 U.S. aggressors, shooting down 2 enemy aircraft, and destroying 2 armored vehicles.

The military and civilian forces of the New An-Ha Tinh region not only actively intercepted the enemy everywhere but also attacked enemy bases. During the same period, the liberation forces attacked De Hoa military airfield and the U.S. military base in My Hiep Commune, De Hoa County, destroying 4 enemy aircraft, 2 military vehicles, and 2 155mm howitzers, killing and wounding 150 U.S. aggressors.

    新安堤岸地区军民奋战十二天歼美军一千多
    新华社河内七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方承天省解放武装力量四月二十八日凌晨猛烈炮轰芙拜美军机场和盘据在那里的美国海军陆战队第三师指挥部。
    据初步消息，共打死、打伤美国侵略者一百三十多名，其中有许多军官和飞行员，击毁敌机五十多架。这个机场的指挥系统遭到严重损失，美军宿舍几乎全部被摧毁。
    敌人遭到突然袭击后，吓得乱成一团。正在巡逻的美军拚命跑回机场，而守卫机场的美军蒙头转向慌忙开枪射击，打死打伤他们的同伙多名。这是承天省解放武装力量今年以来对芙拜机场进行的第二次袭击。这次袭击，使美军的这个重要机场陷于瘫痪。美国强盗为了掩盖损失，在遭到袭击后下令禁止任何人进出机场。
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方新安—堤岸地区军民，在四月九日到二十日期间，英勇粉碎了美伪军的大规模“扫荡”，消灭美国侵略军一千多名和伪军一百名，击毁、击落和击伤敌机二十五架，击毁军车五辆和一五五毫米口径大炮两门，缴获许多军用物资。
    报道说，在四月九日到二十日期间，美国强盗出动两个旅以及好几个主力营的伪军共一万多人，在飞机、装甲车和军舰的掩护下，向东万古河和西万古河流域的边沥、守承、德和、新柱、芹得等县的一些乡发动大规模“扫荡”，遭到当地军民的迎头痛击。
    各个乡的游击队用地雷、陷阱等简陋武器，采取包围、袭击、截击、伏击等机动灵活的战术狠揍敌人，消灭敌人大批有生力量。德和县下休盛乡游击队，在敌人还没有站稳脚跟的时候就紧紧地把他们牵制住，仅在九日到十六日的八天中就消灭美国侵略军二百五十名，击落直升飞机十架。边沥县良和乡游击队也在上述期间内击退好几股敌军的进犯，并且巧妙地把敌人诱进地雷阵，共歼灭美国侵略军二百四十多名，炸毁敌人直升飞机三架，炸伤四架。新柱和芹得两个县的游击队也频繁出击，消灭美国侵略军二百五十名，击落敌机两架，击毁装甲车两辆。
    新安—堤岸区军民不但到处主动地截击敌人，而且还袭击敌军的基地。在上述期间，解放武装力量袭击了德和军用机场和德和县美幸乡的美军驻地，击毁敌机四架、军车两辆和一五五毫米口径大炮两门，打死打伤美国侵略军一百五十名。
