The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants of all nationalities in the agricultural areas of the Qinghai Plateau, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat with the "August 18th" as the main force, have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "seize the revolution and promote production," and have launched the first offensive of the spring production campaign.

At present, the spring sowing work in this province, which mainly focuses on wheat and highland barley, has basically been completed. Weeding, fertilizing, and other field management tasks have also been fully deployed. Under the inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the progress of spring sowing is faster than last year, and the quality is also better than last year.

    青海春播基本结束质量比去年好
    青海高原农业区各族广大贫下中农和以“八·一八”为主体的无产阶级革命派，积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，打响了春季生产第一炮。
    现在，这个省以小麦、青稞为主的春播工作已经基本结束，除草、追肥等田间管理工作也已全面展开。在无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，春播的进度比去年快，质量也比去年好。
