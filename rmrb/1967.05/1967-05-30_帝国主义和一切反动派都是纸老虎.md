After watching the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," I was deeply moved! The revolutionary modern Beijing opera has driven the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies who once dominated the Beijing opera stage off the stage, and allowed the glorious images of our workers, peasants, and soldiers to stride onto the Beijing opera stage. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

"Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" truthfully reflects the scene of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield, where they held high the banner of proletarian internationalism, fought bravely with the heroic Korean people against the enemy, and defeated the enemy in a miserable state. It enthusiastically praises the Volunteer Army soldiers' heroic spirit of being tough and red-hearted, fearless of heaven and earth, and vividly proves Chairman Mao's correct judgment that "all reactionaries are paper tigers."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In front of wild beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice." The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" runs through a red line of daring to struggle and daring to win from beginning to end. The reconnaissance platoon leader and battle hero Yang Weicai in the play leads a spearhead squad to cross obstacles, traverse treacherous terrain, overcome all difficulties, and directly strike at the enemy's heart, achieving victory by surprise and successfully completing the task of destroying the "White Tiger Regiment" command post. The victory of attacking the "White Tiger Regiment" fully demonstrates the boundless power of Chairman Mao's military thought and vividly illustrates that soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest, smartest, and most steadfast. They dare to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire, and are invincible.

I participated in the battle of Tingshuichi on the Korean battlefield. In this battle, the enemy had absolute superiority in weapons and equipment and the number of personnel. Our opponent was the American so-called elite force, the 2nd Division of the U.S. Army, reinforced with a company, while we had only two squads. At that time, our squad was tasked with penetrating the enemy's heart. When I was passing through a low wall, two tall and large American devils suddenly rushed out from behind the wall, each grabbing one of my legs, making my legs unable to move. At this moment, the great Mao Zedong Thought inspired me, giving me boundless strength: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will trample all enemies underfoot and will never be subdued by them." With one hand, I grabbed one head and with the other, I squeezed hard, making the two devils scream loudly. At this moment, my comrades rushed up, and these two devils surrendered. We infiltrated the enemy's heart, disrupting their command. We fought fiercely among the enemy, charging and attacking, and the battle lasted for more than fifty minutes. We killed and wounded more than forty enemies and captured twenty American devils. We quickly won the battle of Tingshuichi. After the battle, we all laughed about the pathetic appearance of the American paper tiger and had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's correct judgment that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. It is a powerful ideological weapon that inspires revolutionary people to defeat all enemies and eliminate all harmful elements.

The success of "Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" gave a resounding slap in the face to the philosophy of surrender of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party! No matter how big a monster the Chinese Khrushchev is, he is just a paper tiger. As long as we remember Chairman Mao's teachings of daring to struggle and daring to win, and hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, we will definitely be able to criticize him down and criticize him to stink!

We, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, should carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Volunteer Army's attack on the "White Tiger Regiment," maintain a high degree of vigilance, and be fully prepared for battle. If the American imperialists dare to provoke a war, we will, together with the people of the world, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fight a bigger people's war, completely burying the number one enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism, and liberating the world!

    帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎
    前志愿军搏斗勇士、解放军某团副参谋长　于世财
    看了革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》，心情万分激动！革命现代京剧，把统治京剧舞台的帝王将相、才子佳人、老爷太太、少爷小姐轰下了舞台，让我们工农兵英雄人物的光辉形象昂首阔步地登上了京剧舞台。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！
    《奇袭白虎团》真实地反映了当年中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上，高举无产阶级国际主义的大旗，与英雄的朝鲜人民一道，同敌人英勇奋战，把敌人打得狼狈不堪的情景，热情地歌颂了我志愿军战士骨硬心红，天不怕地不怕的英雄气概，形象地证明了毛主席关于“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的英明论断。
    毛主席教导我们：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》自始至终贯穿着一条敢于斗争、敢于胜利的红线。剧中的侦察排长、战斗英雄杨伟才，率领一个尖刀班，越障碍，跨天险，排除一切困难，直插敌人心脏，出奇制胜地完成了捣毁“白虎团”指挥部的任务。奇袭“白虎团”的胜利，充分地显示了毛主席的军事思想的无穷威力，生动地说明了用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士最勇敢，最聪明，最坚定，他们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，无坚不摧，战无不胜。
    我在朝鲜战场上，参加过庭水沂的战斗。这场战斗，敌人在武器装备、人员数量上都占绝对优势。我们的对手是美国号称王牌军的美二师一个加强连，而我们只有两个班。当时我们班担任插入敌人心脏的任务，当我通过一垛矮墙的时候，两个又高又大的美国鬼子突然从墙后冲出来，他们各抱住我一条腿，使我两腿不能动弹。这时，伟大的毛泽东思想鼓舞着我，使我浑身增添了无穷的力量：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”我两只手一手挟一个脑袋，用劲一挟，把这两个家伙挟得放声大叫。这时，班里的同志们冲上来了，这两个家伙乖乖地当了俘虏。我们穿插到敌人心脏，打乱了敌人的指挥。我们在敌群中东打西杀，猛冲猛打，战斗持续了五十多分钟，打死打伤敌人四十多个，活捉美国鬼子二十个，很快地取得了庭水沂战斗的胜利。战斗结束后，我们都笑谈美国纸老虎的可怜相，也更加深刻体会到毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的论断无比英明，无比正确，它是鼓舞革命人民打败一切敌人，扫除一切害人虫的强大思想武器。
    《奇袭白虎团》的演出成功，给了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的投降哲学一记响亮的耳光！不管中国的赫鲁晓夫是一个多么大的庞然大物，他也不过是一只纸老虎。只要我们牢记毛主席的敢于斗争、敢于胜利的教导，高举革命的批判大旗，就一定能够把他批倒，批臭！
    我们解放军的指战员应当发扬志愿军奇袭“白虎团”的革命精神，保持高度的警惕性，作好充分的战斗准备，如果美帝国主义胆敢挑起战争，我们就要和全世界人民一道，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，打一场更大的人民战争，彻底埋葬世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义，解放全世界！
