Pledge to be brave vanguards on both cultural and military fronts
Master the skills of holding the gun and wielding the pen, safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and safeguard the proletarian's mountains and rivers

Xinhua News Agency, May 29th - The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary cultural workers, with hearts filled with boundless excitement, joy, and emotion, enthusiastically hail the publication of "Comrade Lin Biao's Letter to the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission" and the "Summary of the Conference on Military Art Work Convened by Comrade Jiang Qing on Behalf of Comrade Lin Biao." They unanimously believe that the "Summary of the Conference" is a great Marxist-Leninist document that shines with the brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought, a red banner guiding the proletarian revolutionaries to victory in the Cultural Revolution, and a sharp weapon for smashing the evil plot of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party to restore capitalism and safeguarding and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The broad masses of soldiers and officers and revolutionary cultural workers have expressed that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly study the "Summary of the Conference," resolutely execute the "Summary of the Conference," enthusiastically propagate the "Summary of the Conference," bravely defend the "Summary of the Conference," and forever learn from Comrade Jiang Qing, the bravest fighter on the cultural front, to pick up the pen and hold the gun, and strive for the dictatorship of the proletariat for life.

Soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in Qinghai Plateau said that this conference was convened by Comrade Lin Biao, the close comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, and entrusted to Comrade Jiang Qing. The "Summary of the Conference" was revised three times by Chairman Mao himself, requiring the People's Liberation Army to play an important role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for the People's Liberation Army, and the highest honor bestowed upon all soldiers and officers of the army. We must turn this honor into boundless strength to contribute all our efforts to achieve new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers and revolutionary cultural workers held discussions. Everyone unanimously said that this document is excellent! It uses Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major questions about the cultural revolution in the socialist period, which not only has great practical significance but also has profound historical significance. Bearer of Company 1, Beijing Garrison Command, Bearer of Company 1, Beijing Garrison Command, said: "The 'Summary of the Conference' is a document that directly confronts the 'Work Summary' created by the Peng Zhen anti-revolutionary revisionist clique with the support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party. At this critical moment of fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the 'Summary of the Conference' has roused the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country and revolutionary masses to launch a counterattack against the top capitalist-roader within the Party and his supporting clique of anti-revolutionary revisionists, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. A part of the revolutionary cultural workers of the Political Department of the Railway Engineering Corps said in a discussion: "The 'Summary of the Conference' is like a thunderbolt opening a new era, exposing the cover of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front, and sweeping away the evil winds and mist spread by the bourgeoisie in the cultural circle. Today, the publication of the 'Summary of the Conference' further points out the direction for us to advance. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers across the army unanimously believe that the "Summary of the Conference," based on Chairman Mao's great theory on class and class struggle in the socialist period, has made a comprehensive, profound, and correct analysis of the situation of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the cultural front since liberation. Soldiers of the "Red Spear Company" and "Sea Tiger Boat" of a certain unit on the front line in Fujian said: The "Summary of the Conference," shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, points out in a penetrating way: In the socialist period, there is a struggle between the two classes and two lines on the cultural front, that is, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership on the cultural front. This front is a crucial outpost in the struggle between the proletariat's anti-restoration and the bourgeoisie's restoration. To smash the counter-revolutionary restoration plot of the class enemy and safeguard and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must highly value the class struggle on the cultural front, thoroughly expose and criticize the anti-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and arts and its ultimate backer, and seize back the leadership they have usurped. Comrades of the Party Committee Study Group of a certain regiment, with hearts full of boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, held a discussion and study session. These old soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in countless battles deeply understand the truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and the important role of the pen in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. When studying the "Summary of the Conference," they seriously reviewed and examined their past work and unanimously expressed that they would learn from Comrade Jiang Qing, grasp both the gun and the pen, and firmly hold both in the hands of the proletariat, fighting forever on both the military and cultural fronts to safeguard the mountains and rivers of the proletariat. Squadron Leader Dong Xiaohai of the "Heroic Aviation Regiment" said: Whether we can grasp the gun and the pen is a major issue related to whether we can consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," and use Mao Zedong Thought to command the "two weapons," and pledge to defend the iron mountains and rivers of the proletariat to the death. Comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the unit where Huang Jiguang was once stationed said: Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings and create new achievements for the revolution and the people. We not only need to have the skills to wield the gun but also the skills to wield the pen; we not only need to be brave warriors charging on the battlefield of real guns and bullets but also brave and strong vanguards in the class struggle in the ideological realm. We must defend the dictatorship of the proletariat like defending every inch of the land at Gangwanling, and like fighting the American imperialists, we must relentlessly pursue and attack the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all enemies entrenched in the cultural front, fighting for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    解放军指战员热烈欢呼《座谈会纪要》发表
    誓做文武两条战线上的勇敢尖兵
    练好掌握枪杆子和运用笔杆子的过硬本领，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级的江山
    新华社二十九日讯　人民解放军广大指战员和革命文艺工作者，怀着无比兴奋、喜悦和激动的心情，热烈欢呼《林彪同志给中央军委常委的信》和《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》的发表。一致认为，《座谈会纪要》，是闪耀着毛泽东思想万丈光芒的马克思列宁主义伟大文献，是指引无产阶级革命派夺取文化大革命胜利的鲜红旗帜，是粉碎党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的锐利武器。广大指战员和革命文艺工作者表示，一定要更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真地学习《座谈会纪要》，坚决地执行《座谈会纪要》，热情地宣传《座谈会纪要》，英勇地捍卫《座谈会纪要》，永远向文化战线上最勇敢的战士江青同志学习，拿起笔杆握紧枪，为保卫无产阶级专政奋斗一辈子。
    驻守在青海高原的某部毛泽东思想宣传队战士们说，这个座谈会，是毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅委托江青同志召开的，《座谈会纪要》又经过毛主席三次亲自修改，要求人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中起重要作用，这是毛主席对人民解放军的最大关怀、最大信任、最大鼓舞，是毛主席给予全军指战员的无上光荣。我们要把这个光荣化为无穷的力量，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新的更大胜利，为保卫无产阶级专政，贡献一切力量。
    广大指战员和革命文艺工作者纷纷举行座谈。大家一致表示，这个文件好得很！它用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，不仅有极大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义。北京卫戍区部队某部连长熊飞义说：《座谈会纪要》是同彭真反革命修正主义集团在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持下炮制出来的《汇报提纲》针锋相对的文件。在无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级激烈斗争的时刻，《座谈会纪要》唤起了全国亿万工农兵、革命群众向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其支持的一小撮反革命修正主义分子进行大反击，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。铁道兵政治部文工团一部分革命文艺工作者在座谈中说，《座谈会纪要》象千钧霹雳开新宇，揭开文艺战线上两条道路斗争的盖子，横扫了资产阶级在文艺界所散布的妖风迷雾。今天，《座谈会纪要》的发表，进一步给我们指出了前进的方向，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    全军广大指战员一致认为，《座谈会纪要》根据毛主席关于社会主义时期阶级和阶级斗争的伟大理论，对解放以来文艺战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争形势，作了全面的、深刻的、正确的分析。福建前线某部“红色尖刀连”、“海上猛虎艇”等单位指战员们说，闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉的《座谈会纪要》一针见血地指出：在社会主义阶段文化战线上存在着两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，即无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的斗争。文艺这个阵地是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争中，必须争夺的前哨阵地。为了粉碎阶级敌人反革命复辟的阴谋，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政，我们就要高度重视文艺战线上的阶级斗争，彻底揭露和批判反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台，夺回他们窃取的领导权。某师党委中心学习小组的同志们，怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，举行了座谈讨论，这些跟随毛主席南征北战的老战士，深深懂得枪杆子里面出政权这个真理和笔杆子对巩固无产阶级政权的重要作用。他们在学习《座谈会纪要》时，认真回顾和检查了过去的工作，一致表示，一定要向江青同志学习，既抓枪杆子，又抓笔杆子，把两杆子都牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里，在文武两条战线上，永远为保卫无产阶级的江山而战斗。空军“航空兵英雄中队”中队长董小海说，能不能掌握枪杆和笔杆这两杆子，是关系到我们能不能巩固无产阶级专政的重大问题。我们坚决响应毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大号召，用毛泽东思想统帅好“两杆子”，誓死保卫无产阶级铁打的江山。黄继光生前所在连毛泽东思想宣传队的同志们说，在无产阶级专政的条件下，我们要牢记毛主席的教导，为革命、为人民立新功。我们不仅要有掌握枪杆子的过硬本领，还要有运用笔杆子的过硬本领；不仅要做真枪实弹的战场上冲锋陷阵的勇士，还要做意识形态领域阶级斗争中勇敢坚强的尖兵。我们一定要象捍卫上甘岭的每一寸阵地一样，捍卫无产阶级专政，象痛击美帝那样穷追猛打党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及盘踞在文化阵地上的一切敌人，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为巩固无产阶级专政而战斗。
