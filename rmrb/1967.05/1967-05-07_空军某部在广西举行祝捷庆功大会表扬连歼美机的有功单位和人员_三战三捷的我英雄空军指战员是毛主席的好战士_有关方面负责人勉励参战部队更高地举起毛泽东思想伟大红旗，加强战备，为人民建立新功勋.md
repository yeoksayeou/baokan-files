Air Force Unit in Guangxi Holds Victory Celebration to Commend Units and Personnel for Shooting Down U.S. Aircraft

The heroic air force personnel of the People's Liberation Army, who have won three consecutive victories, are Chairman Mao's good soldiers.

Relevant leaders encourage the participating units to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen preparedness, and create new merits for the people.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 6th, the Air Force of the People's Liberation Army held a grand victory celebration in a certain place in Guangxi this afternoon. They enthusiastically celebrated the new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, commended the units and personnel who shot down five U.S. imperialist military aircraft in the skies over Guangxi and won three consecutive victories, and encouraged the officers and soldiers to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, carry out the revolutionization of people's thoughts, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend national defense, and resolutely annihilate all invading enemies.

The officers and soldiers participating in the victory celebration, with hearts filled with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and marched proudly into the venue. Around 3:00 PM, when the representatives of the units with meritorious deeds and the meritorious personnel entered the venue, the entire audience erupted in thunderous applause. People held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" On the stage, a giant portrait of our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao was hung. On the banner opposite the stage, it was written: "Exert all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy." The entire venue was filled with a victorious atmosphere.

The meeting began with the majestic song "The East Is Red." Everyone recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "We must not, because of our victories, relax our vigilance against the cunning and desperate attempts at revenge by the imperialist elements and their lackeys. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position."

Participants in the victory celebration included more than a thousand people, including Air Force leaders Yu Lijin and Yang Meisheng of the Guangzhou Military Region, as well as representatives from local revolutionary mass organizations and militia.

At the meeting, Yu Lijin read the commendation order from the Central Military Commission. After reading congratulatory messages and letters from revolutionary organizations and units across the country, Yu Lijin spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically congratulating the participating units on their significant victories in three consecutive battles. He pointed out: These three victories are the victories of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought! They are the victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! They are the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! They are the results of the participating units resolutely implementing the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao to seize the revolution and promote preparedness, work, and production. They are the results of responding to the call of Vice Chairman Lin to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, and carry out the revolutionization of people's thoughts. This victory is a powerful support for the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war and a great encouragement to the revolutionary masses of our country. This victory is a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism.

Yu Lijin strongly condemned the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism. He said, U.S. imperialism is increasingly falling into an inescapable predicament on the battlefield in Vietnam. After the Guam meeting, in close coordination with the Soviet revisionist clique, it is escalating the Vietnam War and attempting to bring the war to our country. We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism and its accomplices: The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. You dare to provoke the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, you dare to provoke the Chinese people tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you will have no good end.

Yu Lijin encouraged the officers and soldiers of the participating units to continue to strive to implement Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school." He encouraged them to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply carry out education on the struggle between the two lines, do a good job in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, military training, and other tasks, firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Yu Lijin also encouraged the officers and soldiers to be humble and vigilant, strengthen preparedness, carry forward the spirit of being serious, responsible, strict, swift, fearless of sacrifice, and continuous combat, and strive for new merits for the people.

Yang Meisheng said in his speech, the great victory of our heroic air force units in shooting down three invading U.S. aircraft has once again proven that Chairman Mao's statement that "weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things" is extremely correct and brilliant. People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. The officers and soldiers of the participating units have achieved remarkable results by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, and carrying out the revolutionization of people's thoughts. They are truly Chairman Mao's good soldiers and loyal defenders of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and have established new merits for defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He pointed out that at present, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is at the decisive moment of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, the class enemies at home and abroad are extremely frightened and enraged. They are colluding and conspiring in various ways to sabotage us. For this, we must maintain a high degree of vigilance, be fully prepared, and be ready to annihilate any invading enemy at any time.

Representatives from local revolutionary mass organizations and militia expressed their warm congratulations to the officers and soldiers of the participating units in their speeches.

Representatives of the units and officers and soldiers who have achieved meritorious deeds, such as Song Yimin, Lü Shanghua, and Zhang Jintang, spoke one after another in the midst of warm applause. They firmly stated: We will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teaching that "humility makes one progress, while arrogance makes one fall behind." We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, focus on the "use" aspect, break private interests and establish public interests, and transform our thoughts; thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; firmly respond to Chairman Mao's call to seize the revolution and promote preparedness, work, and production, and be fully prepared for battle. If the enemy dares to invade, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate it!

The meeting ended victoriously with the song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." (With pictures)

    空军某部在广西举行祝捷庆功大会表扬连歼美机的有功单位和人员
    三战三捷的我英雄空军指战员是毛主席的好战士
    有关方面负责人勉励参战部队更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强战备，为人民建立新功勋
    据新华社六日讯　中国人民解放军空军某部，今天下午在广西某地隆重举行祝捷庆功大会，热烈欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新胜利，表扬在广西地区上空连续击落美帝国主义军用飞机五架、三战三捷的作战有功单位和人员，勉励指战员们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底批倒、批垮、批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫国防，坚决歼灭一切敢于来犯的敌人。
    参加祝捷庆功大会的指战员们满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，高唱着毛主席语录歌，雄赳赳地走向会场。下午三时许，当作战有功单位代表和有功人员进入会场时，全场掌声雷动，人们举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”会场主席台上，挂着我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的巨幅画像，在主席台对面的横幅上写着毛主席的教导：“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌。”整个会场充满了胜利的气氛。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》歌声中开始。人们齐声朗读毛主席语录：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    参加祝捷庆功大会的有中国人民解放军空军负责人余立金、广州部队负责人杨梅生以及当地革命群众组织的代表、民兵代表等一千多人。
    会上，余立金同志宣读了中共中央军委的嘉奖令。在宣读全国各地革命组织和各部队的贺电和贺信后，余立金在大会上讲了话，热烈祝贺参战部队三战三捷的重大胜利。他指出：这三次胜利是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的胜利！是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的胜利！是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利！是参战部队坚决贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席关于抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产的指示的结果。是响应林副主席的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，大搞人的思想革命化的结果。这一胜利，是对越南人民抗美救国战争的有力支援，是对我国无产阶级革命派极大的鼓舞。这一胜利，是对帝国主义、现代修正主义又一次沉重的打击。
    余立金强烈谴责美帝国主义的侵略罪行。他说，美帝国主义在越南战场上越来越陷入无法摆脱的困境，关岛黑会之后，它在苏联修正主义集团的紧密配合下，大搞侵越战争“升级”，并企图把战火烧到我国。我们严正警告美帝国主义及其帮凶：中国人民不是好惹的。你们胆敢向用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民挑衅，胆敢向经过无产阶级文化大革命战斗锤炼的中国人民挑衅，是绝对没有好下场的。
    余立金在讲话中勉励参战部队指战员继续努力贯彻执行毛主席的“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的光辉指示，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起一个更大的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，深入进行两条路线斗争的教育，搞好支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项工作，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行彻底批判，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。余立金还勉励指战员戒骄戒躁，提高警惕，加强战备，发扬认真负责，严格要求，雷厉风行，不怕牺牲和连续作战的作风，再接再厉，为人民建立新的功勋。
    杨梅生在讲话中说，我英雄的空军部队三次击落入侵的美国飞机的重大胜利，再一次证明毛主席的“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物”的论断无比英明正确。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力。参战部队的指战员活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，大搞人的思想革命化，取得了显著成绩，不愧为毛主席的好战士，不愧为毛主席革命路线的忠实捍卫者，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命建立了新的功勋。他指出，目前当我国无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的时刻，国内外阶级敌人怕得要命，恨得要死，他们狼狈为奸，串通一气，千方百计地对我们进行破坏。对此，我们必须保持高度的警惕性，严阵以待，随时准备歼灭任何敢于来犯的敌人。
    当地革命群众组织代表和民兵代表在讲话时向参战部队全体指战员致以热烈的祝贺。
    荣立战功的单位和指战员的代表宋义民、吕尚华、张金堂等在热烈的掌声中先后讲了话。他们坚决表示：一定牢记毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“老三篇”为座右铭，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，破私立公，改造思想；彻底批倒、批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；誓死保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命；坚决响应毛主席抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产的伟大号召，百倍提高警惕，充分作好战斗准备。敌人敢于进犯，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭！
    大会在《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。（附图片）
