The people's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam have severely struck the American aggressors invading the demilitarized zone, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. Preliminary reports indicate that from May 18th to 21st, over 2,000 American and puppet troops were killed or wounded.

After the American aggressors brazenly invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone on May 18th, they carried out brutal massacres of local residents, ruthlessly killing many elderly people, women, and children. The American aggressors also set fire to villages, destroyed rice fields, and forcibly relocated many residents to concentration camps south of the demilitarized zone, creating a "no-man's land" in the southern part of the demilitarized zone.

To severely punish the American aggressors for their serious escalation of the war by invading the demilitarized zone and their heinous crimes of massacring local residents, the military and people of the two counties of Yu Ling and Gan Lu in Quang Tri Province, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, launched fierce attacks on the American aggressors. They conducted concentrated artillery strikes on the enemy's ships, transport vessels, and landing troops, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. From May 18th to 21st, they sank eight enemy warships and patrol boats and shot down or damaged many enemy helicopters. They attacked the enemy everywhere, inflicting heavy casualties. The brave soldiers of the Liberation Armed Forces sometimes defended advantageous positions, launching fierce artillery strikes on advancing enemy troops, and sometimes bravely charged into enemy formations, using small arms and grenades to engage in close combat with the enemy. Local guerrilla forces also conducted ambushes and laid mines everywhere, making the enemy flee in all directions, unable to defend themselves. The American aggressors suffered heavy casualties, and the rear hospitals of the U.S. Marine Corps base south of the demilitarized zone and the U.S. Navy medical ships at sea were filled with wounded soldiers.

According to a report by the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on the morning of May 14th, the Liberation Army of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack on the missile base near the U.S. military base in Da Nang, destroying 96 launch pads, 15 missiles, two large radar stations, one command post, and one radar control post, and burning down one fuel depot, killing or wounding 30 American aggressors.

The report said that this missile base is located on Hill 327 west of the Da Nang Airport. The brave and intelligent Liberation Armed Forces quickly infiltrated the missile base, using explosive packages to turn it into a sea of fire, making the American soldiers panic-stricken and falling into chaos.

    据新华社河内二十五日电　越南南方非军事区以南广治省军民猛烈袭击入侵非军事区南部的美国侵略军，给予敌人以沉重的打击。据初步消息，从十八日到二十一日的四天内，共打死打伤美伪军二千多人。
    美国侵略军在十八日悍然侵入非军事区南部以后，对当地居民进行了血腥的屠杀，很多老人、妇女和儿童被残酷杀害。美国侵略军还到处放火焚烧村庄，摧毁稻田，用武力强迫把许多居民赶到非军事区以南的集中营去，在非军事区南部制造“无人区”。
    为了严惩美国侵略军入侵非军事区的严重战争“升级”行动和血腥屠杀当地居民的滔天罪行，广治省犹灵和甘露两县的军民怀着对敌人的刻骨仇恨，猛烈打击美国侵略军。他们对敌人的军舰、运输船只和登陆的敌人进行了密集的炮击，使敌人遭到重大的损失。从十八日到二十一日，共击沉敌战舰和炮艇八艘，击落击伤很多敌直升飞机。他们到处袭击敌人，给予敌人以很大的杀伤。英勇的解放武装力量的战士们时而据守有利的地形，对行进中的敌人进行猛烈的炮击，时而勇猛地冲入敌阵，用小型武器和手榴弹同敌人展开近战。各地的游击队也到处打伏击，埋地雷，打得敌人东奔西窜，无法招架，美国侵略军伤亡累累，在非军事区以南美国海军陆战队基地的后方医院里和停在海上的美国海军医疗船上都挤满了伤兵。
    据新华社河内二十五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省解放军，五月十四日上午猛烈袭击岘港美军基地附近的导弹基地，共摧毁发射台九十六座、导弹十五枚、大型雷达站二个、指挥台和雷达操纵台一个，烧毁汽油库一座，打死打伤美国侵略军三十名。
    报道说，这个导弹基地设在岘港机场以西的三二七高地上。英勇机智的解放武装力量以最快速度潜入导弹基地，用炸药包把它炸成一片火海，使美军吓得丧魂落魄，陷于一片混乱。
