The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the revolutionary workers with boundless enthusiasm. With the support of the People's Liberation Army, the coal production in Shanxi Province has been increasing month by month. On the eve of May Day, factories and mines in Harbin, Shanghai, and Taiyuan have reported the joyous news of completing the April production plan ahead of schedule.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Taiyuan, the proletarian revolutionary forces on the coal industry front in Shanxi Province, after seizing power from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, have been vigorously promoting revolution and production, bringing about a new and prosperous situation in Shanxi's coal production. In March, the average daily coal output in the province increased by 22.89% compared to February. In the first half of April, it further increased compared to March.

Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party on the coal industry front in Shanxi Province have used various tricks and schemes to sabotage production, causing significant losses in coal production in January and February. At this critical moment, the Shanxi Provincial Military Region and the troops stationed in Shanxi, following the instructions of Chairman Mao, went to various state-owned coal mines in Shanxi to support the broad masses of the left and aid coal production. The soldiers followed Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, emphasizing that "once you grasp it, it works," and conducted extensive class education among the workers, holding meetings for old and new workers to recall bitterness and denounce the capitalist reactionary line. Before the support of the People's Liberation Army, the original coal daily output of Xuan Gang Coal Mine could not complete the plan well. After strengthening class education for the workers, production made significant progress, and since April, the state plan has been overfulfilled, increasing by 23.5% compared to the same period in March.

While helping the coal mines to focus on class education, the People's Liberation Army also focused on building the coal mine production leadership teams. On one hand, they educated the worker masses on how to correctly treat cadres, and on the other hand, they addressed the active thoughts of some cadres, educating them to correctly handle the mass movement and their own issues, helping them to "put down their burdens and march lightly," firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and actively "revealing themselves" to the revolutionary masses. Through study and education, most cadres have further understood Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and their revolutionary spirit has been greatly boosted. While seriously examining their own mistakes, they have also "turned back the tide," bravely taking on work responsibilities, vigorously promoting revolution, and vigorously promoting production, even going deep into the production front lines to dig and mine coal with the workers. In this way, a revolutionary production leadership team was quickly established.

The People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi, while supporting the revolutionary workers in the coal mines, particularly emphasized the prominence of proletarian politics, focusing on the "four firsts," and promoting the "March 8th spirit," passing on the excellent traditions of the People's Liberation Army to the broad revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in the coal mines, supporting the revolutionary left politically and ideologically, and arming the production leadership teams and revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent periods, the proletarian revolutionary forces in various coal mines in Shanxi Province have held meetings to angrily denounce the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and thoroughly expose the "bonus-first" and "quota-first" revisionist lines they promoted in the coal system. The proletarian revolutionary forces in various coal mines in Shanxi Province have combined the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party with the "grasp revolution, promote production" efforts. They have directed the boundless enthusiasm aroused during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, and a new production high tide has swept across all coal mines in the province.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Harbin on the 30th, amidst the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and on the eve of May Day, some factories and enterprises in Harbin have reported the joyous news of completing the April production plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it.

The proletarian revolutionary forces at the Harbin Petroleum Machinery Parts Factory have completed the state plan every month since last August, and on the eve of May Day, they reported the good news of completing the first half of the year's state plan ahead of schedule and exceeding it. The broad revolutionary workers of this factory have combined the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the factory, using revolution to lead production. The total output value for the first four months of this year has nearly doubled compared to the same period last year. The variety and quality of petroleum machinery matching equipment all meet national standards, and the cost has also been reduced compared to the same period last year.

The Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory, which has achieved revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," has, while criticizing the "strike a large area, protect a few" component of the reactionary bourgeois line proposed by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, vigorously promoted production and completed the April production plan ahead of schedule by two days. The 7th Workshop planned to overhaul five forest trains in April, and by the 27th, six had been overhauled.

Some factories and transportation departments in Harbin that support agricultural production have also completed the state plan ahead of schedule.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 30th, the proletarian revolutionary forces at the Shanghai Instrument Factory have vigorously promoted revolution and production, completing the April state plan ahead of schedule by five days and creating a new production record that the factory has not seen in recent years.

Due to the instigation of a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the revolutionary mass organizations within the factory had long-standing disagreements and lacked unified action, affecting the progress of the factory's struggle, criticism, and transformation. After the issuance of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country," with the help and support of the representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory, the proletarian revolutionary forces throughout the factory resolutely followed the words of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, launching a fierce attack on small-groupism, showism, and individualism in their own minds, finally achieving revolutionary unity under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and launching a high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production.

In the current high tide of criticizing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the revolutionary forces in this factory have combined the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit, liberated a batch of grassroots cadres, further mobilized the enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and thus ensured the victory of the state production plan.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Taiyuan on the 30th, the proletarian revolutionary forces at the Taiyuan Transformer Factory have high-held the banner of revolutionary criticism and the banner of proletarian revolutionary unity, vigorously promoted revolution and production, completing the April state plan ahead of schedule by four days and increasing production by 39% compared to the same period last year. Many long-standing "difficult problems" that had been unsolvable were one by one solved in the face of the proletarian revolutionary forces armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and many major technical difficulties were overcome.

For a long time, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in this factory stubbornly promoted a set of capitalist and revisionist management policies, vigorously carrying out capitalist restoration activities. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary worker forces in this factory rose up to rebel against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and achieved victory in the power seizure struggle. They established a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—the Revolutionary Committee—in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. Once the new power organ was established, it immediately promoted a new situation in the factory's revolution and production.

The proletarian revolutionary worker forces united the broad masses of the factory, most resolutely responding to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," and directed the boundless enthusiasm aroused during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. The revolutionary masses displayed boundless wisdom, achieving many technological innovations, and significantly improving labor efficiency.

    文化大革命激起广大革命职工冲天干劲
    山西省各煤矿在解放军支援下煤炭产量逐月增长
    哈尔滨上海太原一批厂矿“五一”前夕纷传提前完成四月生产计划喜讯
    据新华社太原电　山西省煤炭工业战线上的无产阶级革命派，在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权后，狠抓革命，猛促生产，使山西的煤炭生产出现了一派欣欣向荣的新局面。三月份，全省煤炭平均日产量比二月份提高百分之二十二点八九；四月上半月又比三月份有所增长。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，山西煤炭工业战线党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，施展了各种阴谋诡计，千方百计地破坏生产，使一、二月份的煤炭生产一度受到很大损失。正在这个关键时刻，人民解放军山西省军区和驻山西部队遵照毛主席的指示，到山西各国营煤矿，支持左派广大群众，支援煤炭生产。指战员们遵照毛主席关于阶级斗争，一抓就灵的教导，在广大职工中狠抓了忆苦思甜的阶级教育，召开了新老工人忆苦思甜和控诉资产阶级反动路线的大会。轩岗煤矿在人民解放军支援之前，原煤日产量不能很好完成计划；对职工加强阶级教育之后，生产有了显著进展，四月以来超额完成了国家计划，比三月份同期提高了百分之二十三点五。
    人民解放军在帮助煤矿狠抓阶级教育的同时，又狠抓了煤矿生产领导班子的建设。他们一方面对职工群众进行正确对待干部的教育，同时，针对一些干部的活思想，教育他们以正确的态度对待群众运动和自己的问题，帮助他们“放下包袱，轻装上阵”，坚决站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，主动向革命群众“亮相”。经过学习和教育，大部分干部对毛主席的干部政策有了进一步的领会，革命精神大振。他们在认真检查自己的错误的同时，大杀“回马枪”，并勇敢地担负起工作任务，狠抓革命，猛促生产，还深入生产第一线，和工人一起挖煤采煤。这样，促进革命的生产领导班子很快建立了起来。
    驻山西的人民解放军，在支援煤矿革命职工的过程中，特别注意突出无产阶级政治，狠抓“四个第一”，大兴“三八作风”，把人民解放军的优良作风传授给煤矿广大革命职工和革命干部，从政治思想上支持革命左派，用毛泽东思想武装生产领导班子和革命群众。
    最近一个时期，山西省各煤矿的无产阶级革命派纷纷举行集会，愤怒声讨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，彻底揭露他们在煤矿系统推行的“奖金挂帅”、“指标挂帅”的修正主义路线。山西省各煤矿的无产阶级革命派把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争和“抓革命，促生产”紧密结合起来，他们把在无产阶级文化大革命中激发起来的冲天干劲用到生产上去，全省各煤矿都掀起了生产的新高潮。
    据新华社哈尔滨三十日电　在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，在“五一”节前夕，哈尔滨市一些工厂企业传来了提前超额完成四月份生产计划的喜讯。
    哈尔滨石油机械配件厂无产阶级革命派自去年八月以来月月完成国家计划，“五一”节前夕又传出提前超额完成上半年国家计划的捷报。这个厂的广大革命职工，把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争和本厂的斗批改紧密结合起来，以革命统帅生产，今年头四个月的总产值比去年同期增加了将近一倍。石油机械配套设备的品种和质量，全都符合国家标准，成本也比去年同期有所降低。
    已经实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的哈尔滨林业机械厂，广大无产阶级革命派在批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派提出的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分的同时，狠抓生产，提前两天超额完成了四月份生产计划。第七车间四月份计划大修五台森林火车，到二十七日就修出了六台。
    哈尔滨市一些支援农业生产的工厂和交通运输部门，也都提前完成了国家计划。
    据新华社上海三十日电　上海仪表厂无产阶级革命派狠抓革命，猛促生产，提前五天超额完成了四月份的国家计划，并且创造了近几年来本厂一直没有出现过的生产新纪录。
    由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的挑拨，这个厂的革命群众组织之间曾经长时期存在意见分歧，行动不统一，影响了全厂的抓革命、促生产和斗批改的进行。《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发出后，在驻厂人民解放军代表的帮助和支持下，全厂无产阶级革命派坚决听毛主席和党中央的话，向自己头脑中的小团体主义、风头主义、个人主义猛烈开火，终于在伟大的毛泽东思想旗帜下，实现了革命的大联合，掀起了抓革命、促生产的高潮。
    在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判的高潮中，这个厂的革命派把大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来，解放了一批基层干部，进一步调动了革命群众和革命干部的积极性，因此也保证了国家生产计划的胜利完成。
    据新华社太原三十日电　太原变压器厂无产阶级革命派高举革命的批判旗帜，高举无产阶级革命派大联合的旗帜，狠抓革命，猛促生产，四月份提前四天超额完成了国家计划，产量比去年同期提高百分之三十九。一些多年来无法解决的“老大难”问题，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派面前，被一个一个地解决了，很多重大的技术难关被突破了。
    长期以来，这个厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派顽固地推行一整套资本主义、修正主义的经营方针，大搞资本主义复辟活动。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，这个厂的无产阶级革命派职工起来造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，并且取得了夺权斗争的胜利。他们在对资产阶级反动路线的大批判中，建立了全厂革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——革命委员会。新的权力机构一经建立，立即推动全厂革命、生产出现了崭新的面貌。
    无产阶级革命派职工团结全厂广大群众，最坚决地响应伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，用到生产中去。革命群众发挥出无穷智慧，实现了许多项技术革新，使劳动效率大大提高。
