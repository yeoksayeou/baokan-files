Our great leader Chairman Mao has always placed great importance on the struggle between the two classes and the two lines in the literary and artistic sphere. The struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic sphere is, in essence, a struggle for seizing and consolidating political power; it is a struggle over whether literature and art serve the politics of the proletariat or the politics of the bourgeoisie.

As early as 1944, in his letter "After Watching 'Adventurers on the Road to Rebellion' Written to the Yan'an Drama Troupe," Chairman Mao pointed out: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (and in all old literature and art that is divorced from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, while the stage is dominated by gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young misses. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, the old drama has a new look, and this is worth celebrating." However, for a long time, especially in the more than ten years since liberation, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and others, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, openly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. They staged performances of gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young misses on the stage; they did not serve the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but served a small handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and bourgeois elements; they did not depict workers, peasants, and soldiers, but depicted monsters and demons. What is the reason for this?

Through more than a year of great practice in the Cultural Revolution led by the proletariat, we have come to understand: the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of political power. Whether the stage can depict workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve them is also fundamentally a matter of power. Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists refused to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and actively promoted the revisionist black line in literature and art because they had seized the leadership of literature and art with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. With this power, they were able to invert history and confuse right and wrong; with this power, they were able to propagate the black goods of feudalism and capitalism, corrupting and poisoning the people; with this power, they were able to concoct and release a large number of poisonous weeds, attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, attacking the great Communist Party of China, attacking the General Line, the Great Leap Forward, and the People's Communes, singing the praises of the great schemer and conspirator, and inciting landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to take class revenge. In a word, with this power, they were able to turn literature and art into a tool for the restoration of capitalism and create public opinion for the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party to seize the Party, seize political power, and seize the military.

In the Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres of the proletariat took up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, dragged out Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, seized their power, and removed their positions; and exposed the ugly face of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party who supported them under the bright sunlight, and dug out the mastermind behind the revisionist black line in literature and art. This is truly excellent, truly excellent!

We must firmly seize the leadership of literature and art in the hands of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. Let the people's stage serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and restore the true face of history that they had inverted; let the stage, which was occupied by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, become a stage for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to show their talents; let the battlefield for propagating feudalism and capitalism become a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Jiang Qing firmly defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, leading revolutionary literary and artistic workers to wage a relentless struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, creating model revolutionary operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and "The Red Detachment of Women," and the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," and the symphony "Shajiabang," all of which shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. The workers, peasants, and soldiers have now occupied the stage! Under the sunshine and dew of Mao Zedong Thought, the season of blooming flowers of proletarian literature and art is about to arrive! Let us enthusiastically shout: Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

    一定要把文艺的领导大权夺回来
    太原一·二六纺织厂　解悦
    我们伟大领袖毛主席向来十分重视文艺战线上两个阶级、两条路线的斗争。文艺战线上两条路线的斗争，实质上就是为着夺取政权和巩固政权的斗争；就是为无产阶级的政治服务、还是为资产阶级的政治服务的斗争。
    早在一九四四年，毛主席在《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》中指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。”但是，长期以来，特别是解放十几年来，陆定一、周扬等一伙反革命修正主义分子，以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为靠山，公开对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线。他们在舞台上大演特演老爷太太少爷小姐；不去为六亿几千万工农兵服务，却为一小撮地、富、反、坏、右和资产阶级分子服务；不去表现工农兵，却去表现牛鬼蛇神。这到底是什么原因？
    经过一年多无产阶级文化大革命运动的伟大实践，我们明白了：革命的根本问题是政权问题。舞台能不能表现工农兵，为工农兵服务，根本的问题也还是个权的问题。陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子拒不执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，而积极推行修正主义文艺黑线，就是因为他们有在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持下所窃取的文艺领导大权。凭着这个权，他们才能颠倒历史，混淆是非；凭着这个权，他们才能宣扬封建主义、资本主义的黑货，腐蚀毒害人民；凭着这个权，他们才能炮制和放出大批毒草，攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，攻击伟大的中国共产党，攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，为大野心家、大阴谋家歌功颂德，煽动地富反坏右进行阶级报复。一句话，凭着这个权，他们才能把文艺变成为资本主义复辟的工具，为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡政、篡军制造舆论。
    在毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大无产阶级革命派奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子揪了出来，夺了他们的权，罢了他们的官；并把支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下，挖出修正主义文艺黑线的总后台。这真是好得很，好得很！
    我们应该把文艺的领导大权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的革命文艺路线。让人民的舞台为工农兵服务，把被他们颠倒了的历史，再颠倒过来，恢复历史的面目；把被帝王将相、才子佳人所盘踞的舞台，变为工农兵大显身手的舞台；把宣传封建主义、资本主义的阵地，变为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    江青同志坚决捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，带领革命文艺工作者向反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，创造了革命京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》等闪耀毛泽东思想光辉的样板。工农兵从此占领了舞台！在毛泽东思想阳光和雨露的哺育下，无产阶级文艺的百花盛开季节即将到来！让我们热烈欢呼：毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！
