Editor's Note: The Soviet revisionist leadership is fully restoring capitalism domestically, and in the cultural sphere of the Soviet Union, there are equally shocking manifestations. The revisionist clique, using the state power they have usurped, the propaganda tools they control, and the literary and artistic positions they occupy, are constantly instilling bourgeois reactionary ideas into people, spreading the decadent culture and lifestyle of the Western bourgeoisie, poisoning and corrupting the Soviet people, and aiming to maintain their bourgeois reactionary rule.

Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all culture and literature and art belong to a certain class and serve a certain political line." Today, revisionist culture is an important tool for the Soviet revisionist leadership to spiritually dominate the Soviet people, completely serving their revisionist political line. The large number of revisionist literary and artistic works published by the Soviet revisionists viciously attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, frantically advocate bourgeois individualism, humanitarianism, and the theory of human nature, curse revolution and revolutionary wars, defame the great image of Lenin, slander the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, attack the socialist system, and advocate so-called liberalization. All these facts show that there is no such thing as the "national culture" boasted by the Soviet revisionist leadership. Today, what the Soviet revisionist literature advocates is pure bourgeois goods. In the cultural sphere of the Soviet Union, just like in the political and economic spheres, there is a reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat.

The Soviet revisionist leadership is stepping up the use of the literary and artistic positions and all propaganda tools they control to create counter-revolutionary public opinion. However, their evil deeds are completely against the historical trend and the will of the Soviet people. The crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique in spiritually poisoning and enslaving the Soviet people have been resisted and condemned by the awakened Soviet people. The day when the Soviet revisionists are punished by history will not be far off.

The Increasingly Reactionary and Degenerate Literature of the Soviet Revisionists

The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to fully restore capitalism, is further pushing the revisionist line in literature, accelerating the liberalization and Westernization of the Soviet literary circle, and making literary creation increasingly degenerate and reactionary.

The Soviet literary circle, adapting to the needs of revisionist politics, serves the revisionist political line and produces a large number of reactionary and counter-revolutionary works. Many so-called new creations have extremely reactionary ideological content, such as attacking Stalin, criticizing the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system, slandering revolutionary wars, advocating bourgeois humanitarianism and the philosophy of survival, and promoting extreme individualism and the decadent lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. Ilya Ehrenburg's memoirs "People, Years, Life," volume after volume, more frantically attack Stalin, even daring to curse Stalin as "as clever as a human, as cunning as a beast." Sobko's novel "The Fourth Company" describes how a group of political prisoners and criminals imprisoned during the Stalin era became "heroes" in the anti-Fascist war. Korzhenevich's novel "Shield and Sword" maliciously describes how a Soviet scout infiltrated the heart of the Hitler spy organization, obtained intelligence, reported to Stalin, but Stalin ignored the true intelligence, believed Hitler, causing the Soviet people to suffer disaster.

Poisonous weeds attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system are emerging one after another. For example, Kholopov's novel "The Dockworker" depicts the life in Soviet villages and cities in 1937 as pitch-black, even worse than capitalist society. Kazakov's novel "Nestor and Gily" openly glorifies the kulaks, slanders the collectivization of agriculture, saying that living like kulaks is the "healthiest and most beneficial life for society." Works that describe "little people" and advocate Western lifestyles are also increasing. For example, Gladilin's novel "The Story of a Group" uses the so-called "growth" of six middle school students to advocate the debauched lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. They randomly get together and then randomly split up. The protagonist's ideal is to find a way to quickly accumulate a sum of money, buy a car, and go for a drive every Sunday.

Reactionary works advocating the philosophy of survival and the horror of war are rampant on the Soviet revisionist literary scene. They say things like "artistically explaining major war and psychological issues," paying attention to the "complex spiritual world" of people in war. Behind these so-called "psychology" and "spiritual world," there is a naked attack on revolutionary wars. For example, Bagrymov's "Zoya" defames the Soviet military command during the anti-Fascist war, saying that for victory, they did not care about human sacrifices. The protagonist, however, recites Yessenin's sentimental love poems in the midst of cannon fire; another character's philosophy of life is: "Conquering cities requires courage, conquering women requires shamelessness." Gontchar's "Love Conquers All" even attacks the strict discipline of the Soviet army during the Great Patriotic War, cursing those who made laws "against love" as "fools."

Through its mouthpieces and hired writers, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is even more brazenly advocating a set of deceitful revisionist reactionary theories, saying that the "entire content of Soviet art is for people," advocating struggle for "peaceful labor, freedom, equality, fraternity, and the happiness of all nations." Under the pretext of "opposing the embellishment of life," they vigorously advocate anti-socialist, anti-revolutionary "realism" and the so-called "write what is real" slogan, saying that "realism is the most important and outstanding achievement of human artistic genius," and is the most powerful and effective means to make art "popular."

The Soviet revisionist leadership is vigorously promoting the extreme right-wing figures in the literary circle. Not only is Khruchev's "close friend" Sholokhov continuing to receive great rewards, but so-called "products of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU" like Yevtushenko are also highly favored. Yevtushenko is called a "mature" poet, and his anti-Stalin black poem "The Bratsk Hydroelectric Station" is praised by the magazine "Communist." Voznesensky's anti-Stalin black poem "Oza" is nominated for the Lenin Prize, and he is also sent to the United States to "recite" poetry. In addition, the Soviet revisionist leadership encourages the Soviet literary and artistic circles to more brazenly rehabilitate those who were previously criticized, reactionary, and counter-revolutionary writers, and greatly praises such people. For example, the decadent female poet Akhmatova, who received sharp criticism in the early post-war period, is praised as the "ruler of poetry" and a "poetic era" in the Soviet Union. The works of Bunin, a White Russian who fled abroad after the October Revolution, are also praised as "required reading" for young people. The traitor writer Pasternak has become a "true poet" and an "outstanding translator," and his infamous reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago" is about to be published.

Under the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, reactionary artistic trends are rampant, and various bourgeois schools and creative thoughts are rapidly developing, poisoning various fields of art. This situation has caused great dissatisfaction and protests among the Soviet people.

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    编者按：苏修领导集团在国内全面复辟资本主义，同样在苏联的文化领域，也有着触目惊心的表现。苏修集团利用他们所篡夺的国家政权，他们所控制的宣传工具，他们所盘踞的文学艺术阵地，每天每时都在向人们灌输资产阶级的反动思想，散播西方资产阶级的腐朽的文化和生活方式，来毒化和腐蚀苏联人民，以达到维护他们的资产阶级反动统治的目的。
    毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化和文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”今天，修正主义的文化，就是苏修领导集团对苏联人民实行精神统治的重要工具，是完全为他们的修正主义的政治路线服务的。苏修大量出版的修正主义文艺作品中，恶毒攻击无产阶级专政，拚命宣扬资产阶级个人主义、人道主义和人性论，诅咒革命和革命战争，丑化伟大列宁的形象，诽谤伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林，攻击社会主义制度，鼓吹所谓自由化……所有这些事实都说明，根本没有什么象苏修领导集团所吹嘘的“全民文化”，今天苏修的文学所宣扬的是地地道道的资产阶级货色。在苏联的文化领域，同苏联的政治、经济领域一样，存在着资产阶级对无产阶级的反动统治。
    苏修领导集团加紧利用它所控制的文艺阵地和一切宣传工具，制造反革命舆论。但是，他们的这种罪恶勾当，根本违背历史潮流和苏联人民的意愿。苏修集团在精神上毒害和奴役苏联人民的罪行，受到了有觉悟的苏联人民的抵制和谴责。苏修遭到历史惩罚的日子不会太远了。
    苏修的文学日益反动堕落
    猖狂攻击无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，大肆宣扬活命哲学和资产阶级腐朽思想
    苏修领导集团为了全面复辟资本主义，在文学方面进一步推行修正主义路线，使苏联文学界加速自由化、西方化，文学创作日益堕落和反动。
    苏联文学界适应修正主义政治的需要，为修正主义政治路线服务，制造出大量反动的、反革命的作品。许多所谓新的创作，思想内容十分反动，如大反斯大林、攻击无产阶级专政和社会主义制度、诽谤革命战争、鼓吹资产阶级人道主义和活命哲学、宣扬极端个人主义和腐朽的资产阶级生活方式等等。爱伦堡的回忆录《人、岁月、生活》，一卷接着一卷，比以前更加疯狂地攻击斯大林，居然肆无忌惮地咒骂斯大林“象人一样聪明，象野兽一样阴险”。索勃柯的小说《第四连》，描写斯大林时代被关在狱中的一批政治犯和刑事犯在反法西斯战争中怎样变成了“英雄”。柯热夫尼科夫的长篇小说《盾和剑》，恶毒地描写一个苏联侦察兵打入希特勒特务机关的心脏，得到情报，报告了斯大林，但斯大林却无视真实的情报，相信希特勒，使苏联人民蒙受灾难。
    攻击无产阶级专政和社会主义制度的毒草相继出笼。例如，霍洛帕夫的小说《码头工人》，把一九三七年苏联农村和城市生活描写成一团漆黑，简直比资本主义社会都不如。卡扎科夫的小说《涅斯托尔与吉尔》公开美化富农，诬蔑农业集体化运动，说象富农分子那样生活，才是“最健康的、有益于社会的生活”。所谓描写“小人物”和鼓吹西方生活方式的作品，也增加了。例如，格拉吉林的长篇小说《一伙人的故事》，通过六个中学生的所谓“成长”，来宣扬荒淫无耻的资产阶级生活方式。他们胡乱地结合，又胡乱地分开。主人公的理想是，想办法更快地积一笔钱，买一辆小汽车，可以每星期日到处去兜风。
    宣扬活命哲学和战争恐怖的反动作品，充斥苏修文坛。他们说什么要“从艺术上阐明重大的战争及心理问题”，注意在战争中人的“复杂的精神世界”。在这些所谓“心理”和“精神世界”的背后，是赤裸裸地攻击革命战争。例如，包格莫洛夫的《卓霞》，通过对反法西斯战争中苏军战士的心理的描写，诽谤当时苏军指挥部，为了胜利不管人的牺牲。而他描写的主人公，却在炮火连天中背诵叶赛宁的缠绵悱恻的情诗；另一个人物的人生哲学是：“夺取城池靠勇敢，征服女人凭无耻”。冈察尔的《爱情战胜一切》，竟攻击卫国战争时期的苏军的严明纪律，咒骂制定了“违背爱情”的法律的人是“蠢货”。
    苏修统治集团通过它的喉舌和御用文人，变本加厉地宣扬一整套骗人的修正主义的反动理论，说什么苏联艺术的“全部内容都是为了人”，鼓吹“为了和平劳动、自由、平等、博爱和各民族的幸福”而奋斗。他们以“反对粉饰生活”为名，卖力地宣扬反社会主义、反革命的“现实主义”和所谓“写真实”的口号，说什么“现实主义是人类艺术天才的最重要和最杰出的成就”，是促使艺术具有“人民性的最有力、最有效的手段”。
    苏修领导集团竭力扶植文学界的极右人物。不但赫鲁晓夫的“挚友”肖洛霍夫，继续大受奖赏，而且所谓“苏共二十大和二十二大的产儿”叶甫图申科等人，也倍受青睐。叶甫图申科被称为“成熟的”诗人，他的反斯大林的黑诗《布拉茨克水电站》受到《共产党人》杂志的吹捧。沃兹涅先斯基的反斯大林的黑诗《奥扎》被提名为列宁奖金候选作品，他还被派往美国去“朗诵”诗。此外，苏修领导集团还鼓励苏联文艺界更加明目张胆地为过去被批判的、反动的和反革命的文人翻案，并且对这种人大加吹捧。例如，战后初期受过尖锐批评的颓废女诗人阿赫玛托娃被吹捧为“诗歌的主宰”，是苏联“诗歌中的一个时代”。十月革命后逃亡国外的白俄分子蒲宁的作品，也被吹捧为青年的“必修”读物。叛徒作家帕斯捷尔纳克也变成了“真正的诗人”、“杰出的翻译家”，最近还要出版他那臭名远扬的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》。
    在苏修领导集团的统治下，反动文艺思潮大泛滥，各种资产阶级的流派与创作思想迅速发展，流毒于文艺的各个领域。这种状况已引起了苏联人民的极大不满和抗议。
