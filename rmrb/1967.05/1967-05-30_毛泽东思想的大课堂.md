The revolutionary modern Beijing opera *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy* vividly portrays the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, as an exceptionally proletarianized and combat-ready heroic people's army. It successfully creates the heroic image of people's warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The spearhead platoon of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in the play is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They are exemplary in their brave fighting spirit. When they received the glorious and arduous mission of raiding the "Tiger Regiment," they were all filled with high morale and spirits, reciting loudly and powerfully, "Firmly resolve, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." At this moment, I couldn't help but clench my fists and recite these words from the bottom of my heart along with them. In the face of the "Tiger Regiment," the "ace" of the American puppet army, they fully demonstrated their revolutionary heroic spirit of despising the enemy and overcoming all difficulties. They followed Chairman Mao's instructions, viewing the "Tiger Regiment" as a paper tiger strategically, but as an iron tiger tactically. Before setting out, they made a firm, ironclad vow before Chairman Mao's portrait. During the march, when Commander Yang stepped on an enemy mine, they encouraged each other, reciting Chairman Mao's quotations: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will crush all enemies and will never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person must continue the fight." They finally cleverly and bravely removed the mine, escaped safely, and continued their advance. Every step they took, every difficulty they encountered, every problem they observed and handled, they did it according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Mao Zedong Thought unified their will and actions, and Chairman Mao's teachings gave them boundless wisdom and strength. The People's Volunteer Army soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fearless of heaven, earth, and class enemies. They are fearless, invincible heroes. No matter what "Tiger Regiment," "even if it is a block of iron, we will crush it!" This is the dauntless heroic spirit of soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

The heroic image of Yang Weicai is so towering and distinct. He always, in every matter, armed himself with Mao Zedong Thought, led the troops, educated the soldiers, and commanded the battles, never forgetting Chairman Mao's teachings. He has mastered and applied Chairman Mao's military thought. He is an outstanding representative of the broad cadre and soldier masses of the People's Volunteer Army.

The performance of the revolutionary modern Beijing opera *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy* is so excellent! Its strong gunpowder smell and intense battle atmosphere are very much to our workers', peasants', and soldiers' taste. Its successful performance has broken the boundary between the stage and the audience, between the actors and the spectators. The workers, peasants, and soldiers below the stage and the workers, peasants, and soldiers on the stage have completely merged their feelings. I was not just watching a play; I was in the great classroom of Mao Zedong Thought, receiving education and enlightenment. I was not just sitting in the audience; I was a combatant on the scene, participating in the battle.

Seeing Mao Zedong Thought illuminating the Beijing opera stage, seeing the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers taking the stage, I shouted a thousand and ten thousand times: Great! Great! The revolution of Beijing opera is great! We workers, peasants, and soldiers love to watch such revolutionary model operas like *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*!

    毛泽东思想的大课堂

    革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》，生动地表现了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民志愿军是一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的英雄的人民军队；成功地塑造了毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士的英雄形象。
    剧中的中国人民志愿军尖刀班，是活学活用毛主席著作的好榜样，英勇作战的好模范。当他们接受了奇袭“白虎团”这个光荣而艰巨的任务时，个个斗志昂扬，精神振奋，雄壮有力地齐声朗诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”这时，我不由得也握紧了双拳，从心眼里和他们一起反复的默诵。他们在“白虎团”这个美李伪军的“王牌”军面前，充分表现了蔑视敌人，压倒一切敌人的革命英雄主义气概。他们遵照毛主席的教导，从战略上把“白虎团”看成一只纸老虎，在战术上又把它当作铁老虎打。出发前，他们在毛主席像前发出了坚定的钢铁般的誓言。行军中，当杨排长踩上了敌人的地雷时，他们就互相鼓励，朗诵毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”终于机智勇敢地排除了地雷，安全脱险，继续前进。他们每前进一步，每遇到一个困难，每观察处理一个问题，都按照毛主席的教导去做。毛泽东思想统一了他们的意志和行动，毛主席的教导赋予他们以无穷的智慧和力量。用毛泽东思想武装起来的我人民志愿军战士是不怕天，不怕地，不怕阶级敌人的一往直前、天下无敌的英雄。不管它王牌不王牌，不管它什么“白虎团”，“就是一块生铁，我们也要把他捏碎！”这就是用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士的大无畏的英雄气概。
    杨伟才的英雄形象，是多么高大，又是多么鲜明突出。他时时事事处处都用毛泽东思想武装自己，带领部队，教育战士，指挥战斗，都不忘毛主席的教导。他把毛主席的军事思想学活了，用活了。他是我人民志愿军广大指战员的优秀代表。
    革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》的演出是何等好啊！其火药味之浓，战斗气氛之强，非常适合我们工农兵的口味。它的成功的演出，打破了台上与台下、演员与观众之间的界限，台下的工农兵和剧中的工农兵的感情完全融合在一起了。我简直不是在看戏，我是来到了毛泽东思想的大课堂，接受教育熏陶；我简直不象是坐在台下，而是作为一个战斗员，来到现场，参加战斗。
    看到毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了京剧舞台，看到工农兵英雄人物登上了京剧舞台，我千遍万遍地欢呼：好！好！京剧革命就是好！我们工农兵就是最爱看《奇袭白虎团》这样的革命的样板戏！
