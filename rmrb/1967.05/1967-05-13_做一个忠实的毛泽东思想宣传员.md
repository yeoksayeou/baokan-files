Be a Faithful Promoter of Mao Zedong Thought
China Peking Opera Theatre Qian Haoliang

The revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern" is a work created by Jiang Qing and the revolutionary artists of our theatre after a fierce struggle against the top capitalist-roader in the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles. It is like a brilliant red lantern illuminating the Peking opera stage. Its appearance is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art!

I am honored to have participated in this revolutionary work in Peking opera and to have received a vivid education in class struggle and a profound lesson in Mao Zedong Thought.

At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, and when we are filled with boundless enthusiasm to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," recalling the fierce struggle between the two lines during the rehearsals of "The Red Lantern" has further aroused my intense hatred for the top capitalist-roader in the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, further strengthened my boundless love and reverence for the great leader Chairman Mao, and further solidified my resolve to perform revolutionary modern plays and promote Mao Zedong Thought for life.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to be created for them and for their use." However, for a long time, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to create public opinion for his restoration of capitalism in China, has been strongly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art and stubbornly promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art. Under the control of this black line in literature and art, the Peking opera stage has long been dominated by emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, and ancient people. This top capitalist-roader in the Party even personally intervened, directly extending his black hand into the China Peking Opera Theatre. During an audience with the actors, he loudly proclaimed: "In the future, works like 'Mei Long Town,' 'Four Generals Visit Their Mother,' and 'The Pot of Ink' that have strong artistic value and high technical skills can continue to be performed." Under his "advocacy," the vulgar "Mei Long Town" was even included in our theatre's revision plan; the bad plays "The Chain of Command," "The Tiger's Den," and the reactionary "Four Generals Visit Their Mother," as well as the anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds "Xie Yaohuan," "The Stubborn General," and "Nine Rivers" all came out one after another. In an instant, the Peking opera stage was filled with evil winds and mist! It was at this time that Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insisted on the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and led us to rehearse the revolutionary modern play "The Red Lantern," declaring war on this black line in literature and art!

During the rehearsals of "The Red Lantern," especially in the issue of establishing the image of proletarian revolutionary heroes and promoting the great Mao Zedong Thought, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art engaged in a fierce struggle with the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art.

"The Red Lantern" is tasked with creating typical characters and writing the biographies of revolutionary martyrs. It not only aims to make the domestic people understand through "The Red Lantern" how hard-won the proletarian state is and to educate future generations but also to contribute to the people of the world who are striving for liberation, allowing them to gain enlightenment from it.

Comrade Jiang Qing wanted us to highlight the heroic figures, especially to highlight the great image of the worker hero Li Yuhe. A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" not only did not do this but also deleted the scene "The Porridge Shed" that vividly showcased Li Yuhe's clever and brave heroic character. In the scene "Fighting at Jiaoshan," Li Yuhe should be given ample stage space to have sufficient room for action. They insisted on fixing Li Yuhe in one corner of the stage, letting the villain Jiaoshan run all over the stage. The scene "The Execution Ground" is a crucial scene for establishing the heroic image. It should design a complete set of perfect arias for Li Yuhe to express the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the heroic character who has a heart for the country and eyes for the world, further showcasing Li Yuhe's fearlessness in the face of danger and unyielding spirit. However, they deliberately emphasized the cruelty of the struggle, using torture to interrogate Li Yuhe and his mother, using the sentiment of the exploiting class's children to stimulate the audience, seriously damaging the heroic image.

Why did this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" dare to openly oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art? It was because they had the top capitalist-roader in the Party as their backer. They used various means to try to sabotage the Peking opera revolution, but their plots did not succeed. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, "The Red Lantern" finally appeared on the stage. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, their backer was also exposed.

During the rehearsals of "The Red Lantern," I gradually understood the great political significance of performing revolutionary modern plays and gradually understood that to truly make literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian politics, one must follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao. We must transform the old Peking opera, which praises emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, and serves the exploiting class, into a revolutionary new Peking opera that praises the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers and serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Reforming the old Peking opera is the demand of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the demand of the revolutionary era. The heavy responsibility of reforming old culture and old art falls on our shoulders. This is our pride, and we must not disappoint the people and the times' expectations of us. Therefore, when the organization decided that I would play the proletarian hero Li Yuhe, I was very excited. This was the first time I went to write the biography of a proletarian hero.

For me, playing Li Yuhe well is a very arduous task. For a long time, I have been performing plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, detached from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. I am very unfamiliar with the struggle life depicted in "The Red Lantern" and with heroic figures like Li Yuhe. The gap between my ideological level and Li Yuhe is too great. Not to mention playing him well, even correctly understanding this heroic figure is difficult.

There are many difficulties, so what should I do? I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," thereby raising my understanding of Peking opera reform and firming my resolve to perform revolutionary modern plays well. To familiarize myself with heroic figures like Li Yuhe and to play Li Yuhe well, I seized the time to read books about revolutionary heroes and visited railway workers like Li Yuhe. Through study and visits, I raised my ideological level, broadened my horizons, and initially established an emotional foundation for creating the character of Li Yuhe.

The entire performance process was also a process of learning from heroic figures and transforming my non-proletarian worldview. Li Yuhe's spirit of dedicating himself to the Party and the people, fearing no violence, and being unyielding, often educated and inspired me. I deeply felt that to sing the praises of such a person and establish such a great proletarian heroic image, one must start by learning from heroic figures and transforming one's thoughts. In the past, I regarded acting as a means of seeking a living, completely from the perspective of personal fame and profit. With the "self" at the forefront, I unknowingly became a tool for the old Propaganda Department, the old Cultural Department, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee to promote the revisionist line. Looking back at the path I took in the past, I can't help but break out in a cold sweat.

I am determined to use the "Three Articles" as a weapon to fight against the bourgeois ideology in my mind, thoroughly eliminate the evil influence of the revisionist black line in literature and art led by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, and overthrow the top capitalist-roader in the Party. I am determined to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, and be a faithful promoter of Mao Zedong Thought.

    做一个忠实的毛泽东思想宣传员
    中国京剧院　钱浩梁
    革命现代京剧《红灯记》，是江青同志带领我院革命的文艺战士，同党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和他支持的文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，进行了艰苦斗争而创作出来的。它象一盏灿烂的红灯，照亮了京剧舞台。它的出现，是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！
    我光荣地参加了这项京剧革命工作，并从中受到了一次生动的阶级斗争教育，上了一堂深刻的毛泽东思想教育课。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时刻，在我们怀着无比兴奋的心情来纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇光辉著作发表二十五周年的时候，回忆《红灯记》编排过程中两条路线激烈斗争的情况，就更加激起了我对党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子的强烈愤恨，更加增强了我对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和无限崇敬，更加坚定了我演一辈子革命现代戏、宣传一辈子毛泽东思想的决心。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”但是，长期以来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为给他在中国复辟资本主义制造舆论，极力对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，在文艺界顽固地推行了一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线。在这条文艺黑线的控制下，京剧舞台长期被帝王将相、才子佳人、死人和古人统治着。这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，还亲自出马，直接把他的黑手伸进中国京剧院。他在一次接见演员时就大放其毒：“今后象《梅龙镇》、《四郎探母》、《乌盆计》等艺术性较强，技巧性较高的都可以继续上演。”在他的“倡导”下，低级下流的《梅龙镇》居然被列入了我院改编计划；坏戏《连环套》、《恶虎村》和反动的《四郎探母》，以及反党反社会主义的大毒草《谢瑶环》、《强项令》、《九江口》等也都纷纷出笼。刹时间，京剧舞台上阴风四起，妖雾迷漫！就在这个时候，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方向，带领我们排演革命现代戏《红灯记》，向这条文艺黑线宣战了！
    在《红灯记》的排练过程中，特别是在树立无产阶级革命英雄形象、宣传伟大的毛泽东思想的问题上，毛主席的革命文艺路线同反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行了激烈的斗争。
    《红灯记》担负的使命是塑造典型，为革命先烈立传，不仅要使国内人民通过《红灯记》来了解无产阶级江山来之不易，去教育后人；而且要对世界上正在争取解放的人民，有所贡献，让人们从中得到教益。
    江青同志要我们突出英雄人物，特别要突出工人阶级的英雄人物李玉和的高大形象。一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，不但不这么办，而且删去了生动表现李玉和机智、勇敢的英雄性格的“粥棚”一场。在“斗鸠山”一场，应当匀出舞台地位，让李玉和有充分活动的余地。他们偏要把李玉和固定在舞台一角，让反面人物鸠山满台跑来跑去。“刑场”这场戏，是树立英雄高大形象的一场关键戏，应当给李玉和设计成套完美的唱腔，抒发英雄人物胸怀祖国、放眼世界的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神，进一步表现出李玉和临危不惧、坚贞不屈的英雄品质。而他们却极力渲染斗争的残酷性，用酷刑拷打李玉和母子，用剥削阶级的儿女情来刺激观众，严重地损害了英雄形象。
    这一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，为什么敢公开反对毛主席的革命文艺路线？就是因为他们有党内头号走资本主义道路当权派这个后台大老板。他们玩弄各种手段，妄图破坏京剧革命，但是，他们的阴谋没有得逞。在毛泽东思想光辉的照耀下，《红灯记》终于出现在舞台上。在毛主席亲自发动并领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们的后台老板也被揪出来了。
    在《红灯记》排演的过程中，我逐渐懂得了演革命现代戏的重大政治意义，也使我逐渐懂得，要使文艺真正做到为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，只有遵照毛主席所指引的方向前进。我们一定要把歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人，为剥削阶级服务的旧京剧，改造成为歌颂工农兵英雄人物、为工农兵服务的革命新京剧。改革旧京剧，是工农兵的要求，是革命时代的要求。改革旧文化旧艺术的重担，落在我们肩上，这是我们的骄傲，我们决不能辜负人民和时代对我们的要求。因此，当组织上决定我扮演李玉和这个无产阶级英雄人物时，我的心情非常激动。这是我第一次去为无产阶级英雄立传。
    对我来说，演好李玉和是相当艰巨的任务。长期以来，我演的都是帝王将相、才子佳人戏，脱离工农兵。对《红灯记》中所表现的斗争生活很不熟悉，对李玉和这样的英雄人物也很陌生。自己的思想水平和李玉和的差距太大了。不用说演好，就是正确地理解这个英雄人物，都是困难的。
    困难多，怎么办？我就反复地学习毛主席的著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》《为人民服务》，从而提高了对京剧改革的认识，坚定了演好革命现代戏的信心。为了熟悉李玉和式的英雄人物，演好李玉和，我就抓时间阅读有关革命英雄的书籍，并访问了李玉和式的铁路工人。通过学习访问，提高了思想，开阔了眼界，初步建立了创造李玉和这个人物的感情基础。
    整个演出的过程，也是我学习英雄人物、改造自己非无产阶级世界观的过程。李玉和那种一心为党，一心为民，不畏强暴，不为利诱，坚贞不屈的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义精神，经常教育着我，鼓舞着我。我深深感到：要很好地去歌颂这样的人物，树立这样高大的无产阶级英雄形象，必须从学习英雄人物，改造自己的思想开始。过去，我把演戏看成是一种谋求生活的手段，完全从个人的名利出发。私字当头，就不知不觉地沦为旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委推行修正主义路线的工具。今天回头来看过去所走的那条道，不禁出一身冷汗。
    我决心以“老三篇”为武器，向头脑里的资产阶级思想作斗争，彻底肃清以周扬、夏衍为首的修正主义文艺黑线的恶劣影响，打倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。我决心坚决贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线，为工农兵服务一辈子，做一个忠实的毛泽东思想的宣传员。
