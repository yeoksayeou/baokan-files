One year ago, under the personal direction of our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong, a historic document—the May 16, 1966 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China—was formulated. This is a great Marxist-Leninist document. This document is now being published. This document proposes the theory, line, policy, and guidelines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashes the counter-revolutionary revisionist plot of the Peng Zhen anti-Party, anti-socialist clique to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and attempt a capitalist restoration. This document sounds the bugle for the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last February, Peng Zhen’s “Draft Outline” was a thoroughly revisionist program, a program for the restoration of capitalism. The appearance of this program was a major exposure of the long-standing anti-Party, anti-socialist conspiracy of the Peng Zhen revisionist clique. The Circular exposed the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, causing it to collapse. This was a breakthrough. From then on, the counter-revolutionary revisionist line led by the Chinese Khrushchev was thrown into disarray.

This great historic document, personally directed by Comrade Mao Zedong, creatively develops Marxism-Leninism and solves the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Marx and Engels founded the theory of scientific socialism. Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, solving a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism and the problem of the theory and practice of proletarian dictatorship in one country. Comrade Mao Zedong developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of problems of contemporary proletarian revolution and the theory and practice of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat to prevent capitalist restoration. These are three great milestones in the development of Marxism.

The class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, in essence, is still a struggle over state power: the proletariat wants to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. The most harmful of those who attempt to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat are those bourgeois representatives who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag and infiltrate the Party and state leadership organs.

In this great historic document, Chairman Mao points out:

“In the central authorities and in the various departments of the Central Committee, in the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, there are such bourgeois representatives.”

The whole Party must “raise high the great red banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the anti-Party, anti-socialist stand of the so-called ‘authorities’ in the academic world who are in fact bourgeois reactionaries, thoroughly criticize bourgeois reactionary thought in the realms of academia, education, journalism, literature and art, and publishing, and seize the leadership in these cultural spheres. To do this, it is necessary at the same time to criticize and repudiate the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and the various cultural spheres, to purge these elements, and to transfer some of them from their posts.”

“Bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and the various cultural spheres are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have already been exposed by us, some have not, and some are still being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, like Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of the Party Committee must pay full attention to this.”

The great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven how correct Chairman Mao’s scientific judgments are!

These scientific judgments are the guiding light of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the guiding light for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the guiding light for ensuring the transition from socialism to communism.

In a socialist society, especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, do classes and class struggle still exist? Is the class struggle in society still concentrated on the struggle for state power? Is revolution still necessary under the dictatorship of the proletariat? Whose revolution? How to carry out the revolution? These major theoretical questions could not be solved by Marx and Engels at that time. Lenin saw that after the proletariat seized power, the defeated bourgeoisie, even stronger than the proletariat, constantly attempted to restore the old order, and the petty bourgeoisie constantly produced new capitalists and bourgeoisie, threatening the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, to deal with these counter-revolutionary threats and defeat them, it is necessary to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat for a long period. But because Lenin died too early, he did not have the opportunity to solve these problems in practice. Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist. He solved a large number of counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the Party in practice, such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, Bukharin, Rykov, and others. His shortcoming was that he did not acknowledge in theory that classes and class struggle exist in society throughout the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The question of who wins and who loses in the revolution has not been finally settled. If things are not handled properly, there is the possibility of a capitalist restoration. In the year before his death, he already realized this, saying that contradictions exist in socialist society, and if not handled properly, these contradictions can become antagonistic. Comrade Mao Zedong fully paid attention to the entire historical experience of the Soviet Union. In his series of great works and directives, in this great historic document, and in his personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he correctly solved this series of problems. This is a most important sign, marking the development of Marxism to a new stage. In the early 20th century, Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism. In the present era, it has developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao tells us that the main targets of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The contradiction between this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. Solving this contradiction is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. To expose this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to expose their revisionist wares, to thoroughly criticize them, to fight them down, to fight them over, and to fight them to the ground, and to carry out the struggle to seize power from them, this is the main problem that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to solve. This is the general direction of the struggle. We must firmly grasp this general direction of the struggle.

The “Khrushchev-like figures” mentioned by Chairman Mao in this document have now been exposed by the broad masses. This Chinese Khrushchev is the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, the chief representative of the bourgeoisie within the dictatorship of the proletariat. It has now been proven that this biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is an old opportunist. Before national victory, he opposed the proletariat seizing power. After national victory, he opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposed the socialist revolution, and wanted to restore capitalism in China. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, he wanted to restore capitalism in China. It has now been ascertained that Peng Zhen’s counter-revolutionary revisionist “February Outline” was supported by him and is his program.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, what role did he play? He stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, practiced bourgeois dictatorship, suppressed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, encircled the revolutionary factions, suppressed dissenting opinions, practiced white terror, and thought he was triumphant, boosting the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and suppressing the spirit of the proletariat, how poisonous!

Now, everyone is very clear that the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements mentioned by Chairman Mao in this great historic document, the main figures who, once the time is ripe, will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, are this biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road.

To expose this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a matter of the utmost importance concerning the fate of our socialist state and the future of the world revolution, the most important achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary people of the whole of China and the revolutionary people of the whole world unanimously acclaim this great victory. The imperialists and modern revisionists, who attempted to subvert China through their agents, have suffered a great defeat.

The greatest lesson of the history of the international dictatorship of the proletariat is that in the first socialist state, the Soviet Union, the Party and state leadership were usurped by the revisionist clique, and capitalist restoration was carried out. In some other socialist countries, similar things have also happened. It is precisely by summing up the historical experience of the international dictatorship of the proletariat that our great leader Chairman Mao mobilized hundreds of millions of people to carry out this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the most reliable guarantee that our Party and state will never change color. This is Comrade Mao Zedong’s greatest contribution in theory and practice to the international proletariat.

In this document, it is announced that the “Cultural Revolution Group of Five,” originally monopolized by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, is disbanded, and a new Central Cultural Revolution Group is established, subordinate to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. This is an important measure for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The publication of this great historic document is a major event in the political life of our country and a major event in the international communist movement.

Now, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, but serious tasks of struggle still lie before us. We must thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must further achieve the great alliance of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, unite the broadest masses, and unite the majority of the cadres. We must implement the revolutionary “three-in-one combination,” and in places and departments where power needs to be seized, truly seize power into the hands of the proletariat. We must combine the great criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, and complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation tasks of each unit. We must better “grasp revolution, promote production,” and further flourish the various undertakings of socialist construction.

The Central Committee calls on all revolutionary comrades to seriously study this document. Through studying this document, in conjunction with the new situation of the current struggle and the experience of the struggle over the past year, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, further understand and grasp the theory, line, policy, and guidelines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The current Cultural Revolution is only the first one; in the future, it will necessarily be carried out many times. Comrade Mao Zedong has often said in recent years that the question of who wins and who loses in the revolution will be settled only over a very long historical period. If things are not handled properly, capitalist restoration may occur at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country must not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be on guard at all times, never relax vigilance.

    伟大的历史文件
    《红旗》杂志编辑部　《人民日报》编辑部
    一年以前，在我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志亲自主持下制定的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的文件。这个文件现在公开发表了。这个文件，提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团破坏无产阶级文化大革命、妄图实现资本主义复辟的阴谋。这个文件，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命进军的号角。
    去年二月，彭真抛出来的《汇报提纲》，是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领，是一个资本主义复辟的纲领。这个纲领的出笼，是彭真修正主义集团由来已久的反党反社会主义阴谋的大暴露。《通知》揭露了彭真反革命修正主义集团，使这个集团破产了。这是一个突破口。从此，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命修正主义阵线就乱了阵脚。
    毛泽东同志亲自主持制定的这个伟大的历史文件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题。
    马克思和恩格斯创立了科学社会主义的理论，列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，解决了帝国主义时代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题，毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑。
    无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。而妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的危害最大的资产阶级代表人物，则是打着红旗反红旗，混到党和政权领导机关内部的走资本主义道路当权派。
    毛主席在这个伟大的历史文件中指出：
    “中央和中央各机关，各省、市、自治区，都有这样一批资产阶级代表人物。”
    全党必须“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。而要做到这一点，必须同时批判混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶级代表人物，清洗这些人，有些则要调动他们的职务。”
    “混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，证明了毛主席的这些科学论断是何等英明啊！
    这些科学论断，是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，是巩固无产阶级专政的指路明灯，是保证社会主义向共产主义过渡的指路明灯。
    在社会主义社会里，特别是在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本上完成以后，还有没有阶级和阶级斗争？社会上的一切阶级斗争是不是还集中在争夺政权的问题上？无产阶级专政条件下还要不要革命？革谁的命？怎样进行革命？这一系列重大的理论问题，马克思、恩格斯当时不可能解决这些问题。列宁看到了无产阶级夺取政权以后，被打败的资产阶级甚至比无产阶级还要强大，时时企图复辟，同时小生产者不断生长新的资本主义和资产阶级，威胁无产阶级专政，因此要对付这些反革命威胁，并且战胜它，必须在长时期里强化无产阶级专政，舍此没有第二条路。但因列宁逝世过早，没来得及在实际上解决这些问题。斯大林是个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他在实际上解决了很大一批钻进党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物，例如托洛茨基，季诺维也夫，加米?夫，拉狄克，布哈林，李可夫之流。他的缺点是在理论上不承认在无产阶级专政整个历史时代社会上存在阶级和阶级斗争，革命的谁胜谁负没有最后解决，弄得不好，资产阶级就有复辟之可能。在他临死的前一年，他已觉察到了这一点，说是社会主义社会存在矛盾，弄得不好，可能使矛盾变成对抗性的。毛泽东同志充分注意了整个苏联历史的经验，在他的一系列伟大著作和指示中，在这个伟大的历史文件中，在他亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中，正确地解决了这一系列问题。这是一个最重要的标志，标志着马克思主义发展到一个崭新的阶段。在二十世纪初叶，马克思主义发展到了列宁主义的阶段。现时代，又发展到了毛泽东思想的阶段。
    毛主席告诉我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，同广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争的集中表现。把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，把他们那套修正主义货色拿出来示众，彻底批判，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，对他们进行夺权斗争，这就是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要问题。这是斗争的大方向。我们必须紧紧地掌握这个斗争的大方向。
    毛主席在这个文件中所说的睡在我们身旁的“赫鲁晓夫那样的人物”，现在被广大群众揭露出来了。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是无产阶级专政内部的资产阶级的总代表。现在揭露出来的事实证明，这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是一个老机会主义者。在全国胜利之前，他反对无产阶级夺取政权。在全国胜利之后，他反对无产阶级专政，反对社会主义革命，要在中国实行资本主义。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，他要在中国复辟资本主义。现在查明，彭真的反革命修正主义的《二月提纲》，就是他支持的，也就是他的纲领。
    在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动中，他扮演了一个什么角色呢？他站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！
    现在，大家已经很清楚，毛主席在这个伟大的历史文件中所说的那种反革命的修正主义分子，那种一旦时机成熟，就要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政的主要人物，就是这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。
    把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，是一个关系到我们社会主义国家命运和世界革命前途的头等重要的大事，是无产阶级文化大革命的最重要的成果。全中国的革命人民和全世界革命人民，一致欢呼这个伟大的胜利。帝国主义和现代修正主义，妄图在中国通过他们的代理人进行颠覆的阴谋，遭到最大的失败。
    国际无产阶级专政历史最大的教训，就是在第一个社会主义国家苏联，被修正主义集团篡夺了党和国家的领导，实行资本主义复辟。在其他一些社会主义国家里，也发生了这种事情。我们伟大领袖毛主席正是总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，发动亿万群众，进行这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，这是使我们党和国家永不变色的最可靠的保证。这是毛泽东同志在理论上和实践上对国际无产阶级的最大的贡献。
    在这个文件中，宣布撤销原来由彭真反革命修正主义集团包办的“文化革命五人小组”，重新设立中央文化革命小组，隶属于中央政治局常委之下。这是进行无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要措施。
    这个伟大历史文件的公开发表，是我们国家政治生活中的一个重大事件，是国际共产主义运动中的一个重大事件。
    现在，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大的胜利，但是，严重的斗争任务还摆在我们面前。我们要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。我们要进一步实现无产阶级革命派大联合，团结最广大的群众，团结干部的大多数。我们要实行革命的“三结合”，在需要夺权的地方和部门，把权真正夺到无产阶级的手里来。我们要把大批判运动同本单位的斗批改结合起来，胜利完成各单位的斗批改任务。我们要更好地“抓革命，促生产”，使社会主义建设的各项事业进一步繁荣起来。
    党中央号召，一切革命的同志，都应当认真地学习这个文件。通过学习这个文件，结合目前斗争的新形势，结合一年来的斗争经验，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。毛泽东同志近几年经常说，革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
