Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: We must strive to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat must not only liberate itself but must also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought points out the great historical mission of the proletariat and indicates the direction of the proletariat's struggle.

The proletariat is the leading class of the revolution. If the revolutionary faction of the proletariat does not strive to unite with all those who can be united, and relies only on itself to fight alone, it will not only be unable to liberate all of humanity but also unable to liberate itself. Our great leader Chairman Mao, in leading the Chinese revolution, resolutely opposed the "leftist" sectarianism and lone-wolf policies. To achieve victory in the Chinese revolution, Chairman Mao formulated the theory and policy of establishing a broad revolutionary united front, achieving a "great alliance of the people" led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. He organized tens of millions of people, mobilized a vast revolutionary army, overthrew the three major enemies, seized state power nationwide, and achieved great victories in the socialist revolution. Chairman Mao's brilliant thought on the great alliance of the people is one of the magic weapons we use to achieve victory in our revolutionary struggles.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thought has extremely important practical significance for our current struggles. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, must deeply understand and genuinely apply it. Striving to unite with all those who can be united is the strategic thought of the great leader of the proletariat and is the worldview of communism. To grasp and apply this brilliant thought, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat must work hard on transforming their worldview.

Currently, actively helping those masses and cadres who have been misled by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is a glorious task before us, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat. In the current stage of the proletarian cultural revolution, whether we can achieve a great alliance of the revolutionaries and whether we can unite and rally all those who can be united has become a key issue in whether we can achieve the "three-in-one combination," whether we can seize and use power well, and whether we can smoothly complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, always listen to Chairman Mao's words and are forever steadfastly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. Many places and units have already achieved a great alliance of the revolution, and some are gradually achieving it; in rallying the misled masses and in educating cadres who have made mistakes, significant achievements have also been made. However, it must be noted that among us, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, a small number of comrades still harbor various non-proletarian thoughts, such as sectarianism, anarchism, opportunism, and individualism, which are significant obstacles to uniting with all those who can be united.

Some comrades of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat often think that they have more advantages and greater merits, while looking down on other revolutionary comrades and organizations, being very sensitive to others' shortcomings and mistakes; if there are disputes between the two sides, they simply blame the other side, while not being willing to humbly engage in self-criticism regarding their own shortcomings and mistakes, leading to deeper contradictions. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Whether there is serious self-criticism is also one of the prominent signs distinguishing us from other parties." Based on this, we can also say that whether there is a spirit of serious self-criticism is a sign of whether one is a revolutionary of the proletariat. Countless facts prove that after disputes arise between two revolutionary comrades or organizations, as long as both sides start from the principle of unity against the enemy and from the overall interests of the struggle, and engage in mutual criticism in a realistic and truthful manner, especially if both sides or one side have shortcomings and mistakes, and engage in humble self-criticism, they can eliminate estrangement, strengthen unity, and jointly fight the enemy. Our battle cry of the proletariat is "Workers of the world, unite!" We, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat in a region or within a unit, for the sake of carrying the great proletarian cultural revolution to completion, have no reason not to unite!

Some comrades of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat do not show enough enthusiasm in helping those masses and cadres who have been misled by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Even if they have already recognized their mistakes, they still feel that they are conservative and backward, and there is emotional estrangement, unwilling to approach them. Some comrades even want to simply use "seven fights and eight fights" to deal with them. This shows that these comrades, in dealing with the misled masses, have not started from the overall interests, lack the broad-mindedness of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat, stand too low, and see too little. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The attitude of Communist Party members towards backward people is not to despise them, look down on them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to move forward." He also said, the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, "they must be proletarian politicians who can unite the vast majority of people to work together, not only to unite with those who have the same opinions as themselves, but also to be good at uniting with those who have different opinions from themselves, and also to be good at uniting with those who have opposed themselves and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes." We should follow Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings, strive to unite the vast majority of people to fight together, and take the liberation of all humanity as our mission. We have the responsibility to help the masses who have been poisoned and misled by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to free themselves from the shackles of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, we should follow Chairman Mao's policy of "unity—criticism—unity" and "one look, two helps," actively, enthusiastically, and patiently help the misled masses to stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and greatly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Only in this way can we form a vast army of the proletarian cultural revolution, maximize the isolation and attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, complete the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to completion.

    正确对待受蒙蔽的群众
    北京政法学院  政法公社
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：要争取团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类，如果不能解放全人类。无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。毛主席这一光辉思想，指出了无产阶级的伟大历史使命，指明了无产阶级的斗争方向。
    无产阶级是革命的领导阶级。无产阶级革命派如果不争取团结一切可以团结的人们，只靠自己孤军奋战，那就不但不能解放全人类，而且也不能解放自己。我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在领导中国革命的过程中，坚决反对了那种“左”倾关门主义和孤家寡人的政策。为了夺取中国革命的胜利，毛主席制订了建立广泛的革命统一战线的理论和政策，实现了以无产阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的“民众的大联合”，组织了千千万万的民众，调动了浩浩荡荡的革命军，打倒了三大敌人，夺取了全国政权，并且取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利。毛主席关于民众大联合的光辉思想，是我们取得革命斗争胜利的法宝之一。
    毛主席的这一光辉思想，对我们当前的斗争，具有极其重大的现实意义。我们无产阶级革命派，应当深刻领会和切实运用它。争取团结一切可以团结的人，这是无产阶级伟大领袖的战略思想，是共产主义世界观。无产阶级革命派要掌握运用这一光辉思想，就必须在改造世界观方面狠下功夫。
    当前，积极帮助那些受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众和干部，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，这是摆在我们无产阶级革命派面前的一项光荣任务。在无产阶级文化大革命的现阶段，能不能实现革命派的大联合，能不能争取和团结一切可以团结的人们，已成为能不能实现革命的“三结合”，能不能掌好权用好权，能不能顺利完成斗批改任务的关键问题。我们无产阶级革命派，最听毛主席的话，永远坚定地忠于毛泽东思想。许多地方、许多单位，已实现了革命的大联合，有的正在逐步实现革命的大联合；在争取团结受蒙蔽的群众方面，在争取教育犯错误的干部方面，也已作出了很大成绩。但是，必须看到，在我们无产阶级革命派中，还有少部分同志，存在着种种非无产阶级思想，如小团体主义、无政府主义、风头主义、个人主义，等等，这对争取团结一切可以团结的人是一大障碍。
    有的无产阶级革命派的同志，往往认为自己的优点多、功劳大，而看不起别的革命同志和别的革命组织，对人家的缺点错误很敏感；如果双方发生一些争执，他们就单纯指责对方，而对自己的缺点错误，不肯虚心作自我批评，以致矛盾越来越深。毛主席早就指出：“有无认真的自我批评，也是我们和其他政党互相区别的显著的标志之一。”据此，我们也可以说，有无认真的自我批评的精神，是区别是不是无产阶级革命派的一个标志。无数事实证明，在两个革命同志或两个革命组织发生争执以后，只要双方从团结对敌的原则出发，从斗争的全局利益出发，实事求是地相互进行批评，尤其有缺点错误的双方或一方，虚心地作自我批评，就能消除隔阂，加强团结，共同对敌。我们无产阶级的战斗口号是“全世界无产者，联合起来！”我们在一个地区，或是在一个单位内的无产阶级革命派，为了把伟大的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，有什么理由不能团结起来呢？
    有的无产阶级革命派同志，对曾受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众和干部，热情帮助不够，即使他们已经认识错误，也总觉得他们保守、落后，感情上有隔阂，不愿接近他们。有的同志甚至想单纯用“七斗八斗”去对待他们。这就说明，这些同志在对待受蒙蔽的群众，没有从全局利益出发，缺乏无产阶级革命派的宽大胸怀，站的不高，看的不远。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”又说，无产阶级革命事业的接班人，“他们必须是能够团结绝大多数人一道工作的无产阶级政治家，不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”我们应遵循毛主席的亲切教导，要争取团结绝大多数人一道进行斗争，以解放全人类为己任。我们有责任帮助受资产阶级反动路线毒害和蒙蔽的群众，使他们从资产阶级反动路线的束缚下解放出来，因此，就应当按照毛主席“团结——批评——团结”和“一看二帮”的方针，积极热情、耐心细致地帮助受蒙蔽的群众，使他们站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。只有这样，我们才能组成浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，完成斗批改的伟大任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
