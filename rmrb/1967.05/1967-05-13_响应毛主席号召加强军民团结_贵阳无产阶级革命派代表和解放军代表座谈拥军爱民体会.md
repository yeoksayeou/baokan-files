Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions from various factories, mines, schools, and government agencies in the Guiyang area, along with representatives of the People's Liberation Army participating in supporting leftist movements, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, recently held a symposium. They resolutely responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao to support the military and love the people, with the military loving the people and the people loving the military, and with military and civilian unity, to overthrow and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their respective departments, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The deputy director of the Ganyin Pond Granary Processing Factory Revolutionary Committee in Guiyang, loader worker Luo Huipeng, said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The People's Liberation Army is the great revolutionary army personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. It is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionary factions. The army listens to Chairman Mao's words the most. After coming to our factory, they resolutely supported our revolutionary faction, helping us seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders. The People's Liberation Army actively supports the broad leftist masses, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary factions, making the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists tremble with fear and hatred. They collude with each other, spread malicious rumors, and slander the army, attempting to divert the direction of the struggle and turn the spearhead of the struggle against the army to realize their plot to restore capitalism. We workers and poor peasants love the army the most and support the army the most. Anyone who opposes the army, we will not agree to.

The director of the Guiyang Cotton Mill Revolutionary Committee, Liu Zizhen, said: After the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, how to consolidate the power that has been seized and use it well is a very important issue. After our factory's proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party were not reconciled and attempted to counterattack, trying to sabotage our revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. At this critical moment, the military representatives arrived at our factory. As soon as the military representatives entered the factory, they firmly grasped the struggle between the two lines and two roads, deeply entered the workshops and teams to widely listen to the opinions of the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, resolutely supporting all our revolutionary actions, and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our factory's dyeing workshop was previously influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line, indiscriminately making three leading cadres of the workshop stand aside. After learning about this, the military representatives actively sought out workers and cadres to have heart-to-heart talks, explaining Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to everyone, studying Chairman Mao's cadre policy together, and helping cadres bravely appear before the masses, which was welcomed by the revolutionary workers. This workshop finally established a revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team, strongly promoting the revolution and production in the workshop. Now, with the strong support and assistance of the military representatives, our revolutionary faction is becoming more united, and the power is being held more firmly.

The deputy director of the Guiyang Cotton Mill Revolutionary Committee, Liu Liquan, said: The military representatives stationed in our factory remember Chairman Mao's teachings, first supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions politically, bringing the experience of the army's emphasis on politics and the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works to the broad revolutionary masses. They always appear as ordinary laborers, eating, living, working, and studying Chairman Mao's works with the revolutionary faction workers. They conduct in-depth and detailed investigative research, widely listen to the opinions of the masses, and seriously do the ideological work of the masses. Liu Zizhen said: The spirit of the People's Liberation Army serving the revolutionary workers wholeheartedly is forever a good example for us revolutionaries to learn from.

High school student Gao Yuqin from Guiyang Girls' Middle School said: Our school has four or five relatively large Red Guard organizations, which, due to the influence of anarchist trends, have poor organizational discipline. Since learning from the People's Liberation Army, our organizational discipline has been greatly strengthened, quickly promoting the great unity of the entire school, and establishing a unified Red Guard organization—the Guiyang Girls' Middle School Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought. We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers and the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. We must learn well from the People's Liberation Army, learn their three-eight work style, and strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the Red Guard troops.

The military representative stationed at the Ganyin Pond Granary Processing Factory, Zhan Yuanwen, said: In our work of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military management, and military training, we must act according to the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao on high-holding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in all work, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and grasping the active thoughts. In the factory, we conducted activities to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works with the worker masses, studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party," "Against Libertinism," and other brilliant works, helping revolutionary workers overcome anarchist trends and small-groupism, and achieving revolutionary unity in the spirit of revolution not distinguishing between early and late, and organizations not distinguishing between large and small, establishing a revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ. The revolutionary cadres in the factory also came out of the office to participate in labor, thus improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, strengthening unity, and pushing the revolution and production to a new height.

Zhang Zicheng from the Guizhou Provincial Military Region's Leftist Support Office said: The People's Liberation Army's involvement in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military management, and military training is, on the one hand, assistance from the troops to the local areas, and on the other hand, the greatest support from the local areas to the troops. The masses are the true heroes. They have created great achievements in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production struggles. Through supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military management, and military training, the troops have learned precious experiences of class struggle from the local revolutionary masses, greatly strengthening the class struggle awareness of cadres and soldiers, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops.

Military representatives from the Guiyang Cotton Mill, Tan Tianhe, and the Guizhou Provincial Military Region's Leftist Support Office, Zhang Zicheng, among others, all expressed in their speeches: Chairman Mao teaches us, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this point, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." After entering the factory, we first became students, deeply entering the masses, blending with them, relying on them, respecting their pioneering spirit, firmly supporting their revolutionary actions, and learning their good styles and thoughts, establishing deep class feelings with them. The proletarian revolutionary factions, especially the young revolutionaries, can correctly treat themselves. They not only regard themselves as a force of the revolution but also regard themselves as an object of the revolution, especially paying attention to transforming the objective world while transforming their subjective world. We must correctly treat them, cherish them, firmly support their revolutionary actions, and at the same time, learn from them.

The attending military representatives also expressed: Chairman Mao said, "The army must blend with the people, making the army appear as the people's own army in the eyes of the people. Such an army is invincible." We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, blend with the people, think what they think, worry about what they worry about, and be happy about what they are happy about. In the current great struggle of the people across the country to denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, we, the People's Liberation Army, must unite more closely with the broad revolutionary masses, and jointly fight for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    响应毛主席号召加强军民团结
    贵阳无产阶级革命派代表和解放军代表座谈拥军爱民体会
    新华社贵阳十二日电  贵阳地区部分厂矿、学校、机关的无产阶级革命派代表和参加支左、支工、支农的人民解放军代表，最近举行座谈会，坚决响应我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的拥军爱民的号召，军爱民，民爱军，军民团结一条心，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒批臭，把本部门的斗批改彻底搞好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    贵阳市甘荫塘粮食仓库加工厂革命委员会副主任委员、装卸工人罗惠鹏说：毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪同志直接指挥的伟大革命军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是我们无产阶级革命派的强大后盾。解放军最听毛主席的话，来到我们厂后，坚决支持我们革命派，使我们从一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺回了大权。人民解放军积极支持左派广大群众，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和地富反坏右分子怕得要命，恨得要死，他们互相勾结，煽阴风，点邪火，造谣中伤解放军，挑拨军民关系，妄图转移斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头指向解放军，实现他们复辟资本主义的阴谋。我们工人、贫下中农最热爱解放军，最拥护解放军，谁要反对解放军，我们坚决不答应。
    贵阳棉纺厂革命委员会主任委员刘自真说：无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手中夺权以后，如何巩固已夺得的权，并且用好权，是一个十分重要的问题。我们厂无产阶级革命派夺权后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派心不死，企图对革命派进行反扑，妄想搞垮我们的革命的“三结合”。正在这时，驻军代表来到我们厂。驻军代表一进厂，就紧紧抓住两条道路、两条路线斗争这条纲，深入到车间、班组广泛地听取我们无产阶级革命派和革命群众的意见，坚决支持我们的一切革命行动，坚定地贯彻执行毛主席的革命路线。我厂印染车间以前受了资产阶级反动路线的影响，不加区别地让车间的三个领导干部都靠边站了。驻军代表知道后，主动找职工和干部谈心，跟大家讲毛主席的革命路线，一起学习毛主席的干部政策，帮助干部勇敢地到群众中去亮相，受到了革命职工的欢迎。这个车间终于建立了革命的“三结合”的领导班子，有力地推动了车间的革命和生产。现在，在驻军代表的大力支持和帮助下，我们革命派团结得越来越紧，权越掌越牢。
    贵阳棉纺厂革命委员会副主任委员刘立全说：驻我厂的军代表牢记毛主席的教导，首先从政治思想上支援无产阶级革命派，把解放军突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作的经验，带给了广大革命群众。他们始终以一个普通劳动者的身份出现，与革命派职工同吃、同住、同劳动、同学毛主席著作。他们进行深入细致的调查研究工作，广泛听取群众意见，认真作好群众的思想工作。刘自真说：解放军全心全意地为革命职工服务的革命精神，永远是我们革命派学习的好榜样。
    贵阳女子中学毛泽东思想红卫兵高玉琴说：我校有四、五个较大的红卫兵组织，由于受了无政府主义思潮的影响，组织纪律较差。自从向解放军学习后，我们的组织纪律性大大加强了，很快促成了全校的大联合，成立了统一的红卫兵组织——贵阳女中毛泽东思想红卫兵。我们是毛主席的红小兵，是解放军的后备力量，我们一定要很好地向解放军学习，学习他们的三八作风，加强红卫兵队伍的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
    贵阳市甘荫塘粮食仓库加工厂驻军代表詹元文说：我们在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项工作中，必须按照林彪副主席关于在一切工作中，都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想的指示办事。我们在加工厂同职工群众一起开展活学活用毛主席著作的活动，学习了“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作，使革命职工克服了无政府主义思潮和小团体主义思想，本着革命不分先后、组织不分大小的精神，实行了革命的大联合，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。厂里的革命干部也走出了办公室，参加劳动，从而改善了干群关系，增强了团结，把革命和生产推向了一个新的高潮。
    贵州省军区支左办公室张子臣说：解放军投入支左、支工、支农、军管、军训这五项工作，一方面，这是部队援助了地方，另一方面，这也是地方给部队的最大支援。人民群众是真正的英雄，他们在文化大革命和生产斗争中创造了丰功伟绩。部队通过支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项工作，从地方革命群众那里学到了阶级斗争的宝贵经验，大大加强了干部和战士的阶级斗争观念，促进了部队的思想革命化。
    贵阳棉纺厂军代表谭天和、省军区支左办公室张子臣等在发言中都表示：毛主席教导我们说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们进厂后，首先是做小学生，深入群众，同群众打成一片，紧紧地依靠他们，尊重他们的首创精神，坚决支持他们的革命行动，把他们的好作风、好思想学到手，同他们建立了深厚的阶级感情。无产阶级革命派，尤其是革命小将，最能够正确对待自己，他们不但把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时也把自己当作革命的对象，特别注意在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。我们要正确对待他们，爱护他们，坚决支持他们的革命行动，同时也要向他们学习。
    出席座谈会的解放军代表还表示：毛主席说：“军队须和民众打成一片，使军队在民众眼睛中看成是自己的军队，这个军队便无敌于天下”。我们一定遵照毛主席的教导，同人民群众打成一片，想他们所想，急他们所急，乐他们所乐。在当前，全国人民口诛笔伐党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大决战中，我们解放军要与广大革命群众更紧密地团结起来，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而共同战斗。
