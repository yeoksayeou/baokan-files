The All-China Women's Federation welcomed the delegation of women from the (Authentic) Japan-China Friendship Association. The revolutionary peoples of China and Japan have forged a deep friendship through their struggles. Nakajima Chiyo strongly condemns the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist elements for sabotaging Sino-Japanese friendship.

	BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) — Nakajima Chiyo, leader of the delegation of women from the (Authentic) Japan-China Friendship Association headquarters visiting China, said in Beijing: Chairman Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Japanese revolutionary women are determined to study the works of the great leader Chairman Mao, grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, and fight for the independence and liberation of Japan.

	Nakajima Chiyo made these remarks at a tea party held by the All-China Women's Federation to welcome the delegation this afternoon. Representatives from the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of the capital, the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, the People's Liberation Army, and the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities attended the tea party and exchanged warm greetings with the Japanese women friends, discussing the fighting friendship between revolutionary women of China and Japan.

	Yang Yunyu, a member of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, spoke first at the tea party. She expressed on behalf of Chinese revolutionary women her respect to the Japanese women representatives who are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism, the Japanese monopoly capitalist clique, and the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party. She said, the revolutionary peoples and women of China and Japan have forged a fighting friendship in the struggle against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. The hundreds of millions of Chinese women are determined to forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unite with Japanese revolutionary women, fight together, and win together.

	Nakajima Chiyo said, the victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also a great support for the proletariat and oppressed nations of the world. She said, U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various followers are extremely afraid of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, which shows that they are all paper tigers. She condemned the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist elements for their plot to sabotage the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. She said, the broad masses of the Japanese people have made up their minds to smash this plot and have launched an unyielding struggle. The tide of Sino-Japanese friendship is unstoppable by any force. Nakajima Chiyo expressed her belief that in the struggle against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their various followers, the unbreakable fighting friendship between the peoples and revolutionary women of the two countries will be further consolidated and developed.

	Representatives from the Revolutionary Workers' Congress of the capital, the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, and the Red Guards of colleges and universities also spoke at the tea party. They expressed that Chinese revolutionary women are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, and make greater contributions to opposing U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, to supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, and to strengthening the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

	The tea party featured song and dance performances. In the end, the revolutionary women representatives of the two countries joined hands and sang "The Boatman's Song" and "The Internationale."

    新华社四日讯　日中友协（正统）总部妇女访华代表团团长中岛千代在北京说：毛泽东主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。日本革命妇女决心学习伟大领袖毛主席的著作，掌握伟大的毛泽东思想，为争取日本的独立和解放进行斗争。
    中岛千代是在今天下午全国妇联为欢迎代表团举行的茶会上讲这些话的。首都革命职工代表会议、贫下中农代表会议、中国人民解放军和首都大专院校红代会的女代表出席了茶会，和日本妇女朋友一起畅叙中日两国革命妇女的战斗友谊。

    中岛千代说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅是中国人民的胜利，也是对全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族的巨大支援。她说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和它们的形形色色的追随者，万分惧怕中国无产阶级文化大革命，这说明它们都不过是纸老虎。她谴责日共修正主义分子破坏日中两国人民友谊的阴谋。她说，日本广大人民都下定决心粉碎这一阴谋，并展开了不屈不挠的斗争。日中友好的潮流是任何力量也阻挡不了的。中岛千代表示相信，在日中两国人民反对共同的敌人美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其形形色色的追随者的斗争中，两国人民和革命妇女的牢不可破的战斗友谊将会更加巩固发展。

    茶会上演出了歌舞节目。最后中日两国革命的妇女代表手挽手高唱《大海航行靠舵手》、《国际歌》。
