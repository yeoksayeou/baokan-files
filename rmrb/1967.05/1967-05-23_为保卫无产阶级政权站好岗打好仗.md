The May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, broadcasted to the frontline air defense positions of our motherland, sparked lively discussions among comrades and filled the camp with joy.

This great historical document was personally directed by the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. This document creatively develops Marxism-Leninism. For the first time in the history of the international communist movement, it proposes the theory, line, principles, and policies of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, sounding the charge to carry the socialist revolution to the end and striking the death knell for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The publication of the Circular is a major event in our country's political life and a major event in the international communist movement. As soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, hearing the call of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, how can we not cheer and sing, how can we not charge forward!

Over the past year, under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has achieved one brilliant victory after another. The masses have been mobilized, the ranks of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat have swelled, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and Khrushchev-like figures have been exposed, and their ultimate backer, the ultimate root—the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party—has been exposed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the Chinese revolution, and a great victory for the world revolution.

The brilliant victories of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat fully prove that Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat are extremely wise and extremely correct. They prove that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is concentrated on the issue of whether the bourgeoisie will stage a counter-revolutionary restoration or the proletariat will prevent it, which is the issue of power. Peng Zhen and his clique, along with their backers—the biggest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party—have long been seizing the ideological realm, preparing public opinion. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and restoring capitalism. Chairman Mao timely exposed the wolfish ambitions of this bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists, personally initiating and leading the unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, leading hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to launch a great struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This struggle is the most reliable guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensuring that the proletarian heaven will never change color, and it is the most reliable guarantee for the transition from socialism to communism. The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat initiated by Chairman Mao is the greatest contribution to the international proletariat in both theory and practice.

The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is too important. Without this great revolution, our proletarian power would be lost, the country would change color, and the heads of millions of people would roll. We, the slaves of the old society, would return to the days of deep suffering! In the old society, my father worked for the fish tycoons, enduring endless exploitation, my mother worked for the capitalists, enduring endless torment, and I grew up picking coal from the garbage heap. Chairman Mao led the people to overthrow the reactionaries and seize power, and only then did our family and the broad masses of laboring people stand up. Remembering the bitterness of the past when the laboring people had no power, we cherish the sweetness of having power today even more. The biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are trying to seize our proletarian power, can we agree to that? No, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no! We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power, and resolutely struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, firmly grasp the power of the proletariat, and implement dictatorship over them. The biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their followers, though still alive, are not dead in spirit. They continue to plot various tricks to stage a comeback. We must thoroughly expose and criticize them, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, fight them down, and fight them to the end.

The People's Liberation Army, personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, loves Chairman Mao and his proletarian revolutionary line with all our hearts, and hates the bourgeois reactionary line concocted by the biggest power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party to the core. We are entrusted with the glorious task of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, defending the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and defending the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must engrave Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, melt it into our blood, and implement it in our actions. If Chairman Mao tells us to ascend to the heavens, we will tread a path to the heavens; if Chairman Mao tells us to dive into the seas, we will drain the five oceans. To ensure that the iron-clad heaven of the proletariat will never change color, we dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire.

We must be absolutely vigilant against all class enemies, overcome the slightest relaxation, seize the revolution and promote preparedness for war, stand guard and fight well to defend the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must tightly grasp the gun and the pen, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and like striking down the American air pirates, strike down the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their followers, making them bloom in the air and be smashed to pieces, ensuring they never rise again. Let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine over all of China and all the world!

    为保卫无产阶级政权站好岗打好仗
    中国人民解放军空军某部　董小海
    中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，从广播里传到祖国的空防前哨阵地后，同志们纷纷座谈，营区里一片欢腾。
    这个伟大的历史文件，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席亲自主持制定的。这个文件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，在国际共产主义运动史上，第一次提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，吹响了将社会主义革命进行到底的进军号角，敲响了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底垮台的丧钟。《通知》的公开发表，是我们国家政治生活中的一个重大事件，是国际共产主义运动中的一个重大事件。我们解放军战士，听到最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的号召，怎能不为之欢呼歌唱，怎能不为之冲锋前进！
    一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自领导下，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利。广大群众发动起来了，无产阶级革命派的队伍壮大起来了，一小撮反革命修正主义分子，赫鲁晓夫式的人物被揭露出来了，他们的总后台、总根子党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派被揭露出来了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是中国革命的伟大胜利，也是世界革命的伟大胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，充分证明了毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策极其英明，极其正确，证明了无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是资产阶级反革命复辟与无产阶级反复辟的问题，也就是政权问题。彭真一伙同他们的后台老板——党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，早就在抓意识形态，做舆论准备，一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取政权，把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。毛主席及时识破了他们这一伙反革命修正主义分子的狼子野心，亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，率领亿万革命群众，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了反复辟的伟大斗争。这个斗争，是巩固无产阶级专政、使无产阶级江山永不变色的最可靠保证，是使社会主义向共产主义过渡的最可靠保证。毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命，是在理论上和实践上对国际无产阶级的最伟大的贡献。
    无产阶级文化大革命太重要了。不进行这场大革命，我们的无产阶级政权就要丧失，国家就要变色，千百万人头就会滚滚落地，我们这些旧社会的奴隶，就得回到水深火热的日子里重受二遍苦！在旧社会，我的父亲给鱼霸打鱼，受尽剥削，母亲给资本家干活，受尽折磨，我自己是趴在垃圾堆上拣煤核长大的。毛主席领导人民打倒了反动派，夺取了政权，我们全家和广大劳动人民才翻了身。回忆过去劳动人民没有政权的苦，倍觉今天有了政权的甜。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图从我们手里把无产阶级政权夺过去，我们能答应吗？不能，一千个不能，一万个不能！我们一定要遵照毛主席关于革命的根本问题是政权问题的教导，坚决同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行斗争，牢牢掌握无产阶级的政权，对他们实行专政。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其追随者，人还在，心不死，他们还不断施展各种阴谋诡计进行反扑，我们一定要对他们彻底揭露，彻底批判，把他们批深、批透、斗倒、斗臭。
    伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、林彪同志直接指挥的中国人民解放军，对毛主席、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线爱入肺腑，对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其炮制的资产阶级反动路线恨之入骨。我们肩负着保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级专政的光荣任务。我们一定要把毛泽东思想铭刻在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。毛主席要我们上九天，我们就踩出通天道；毛主席要我们下四海，我们就掏尽五洋水。为了确保无产阶级铁打江山永不变色，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。
    我们一定要对一切阶级敌人树立绝对的警惕，克服稍微的松懈，抓革命、促战备，为保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级政权站好岗，打好仗。我们要紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，象打击美国空中强盗一样，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其追随者，打个空中开花，粉身碎骨，叫他们永世不得翻身。让毛泽东思想的光芒永远普照全中国，普照全世界！
