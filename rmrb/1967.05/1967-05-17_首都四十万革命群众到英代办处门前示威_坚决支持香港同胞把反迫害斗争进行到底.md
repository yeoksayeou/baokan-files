Hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses in the capital gathered in front of the British Office in China today, holding a massive demonstration and march. They resolutely support the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and firmly back the just struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against the oppression of British imperialism.

Today, from early morning until late at night, the capital's revolutionary masses roared with indignation, shaking the heavens and the earth. On the roads leading to the British Office in China, the demonstration and march formed an unbroken chain. People, filled with fighting spirit, repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "We must demand blood debt from the British imperialists!" "The U.S. imperialists will not have a good end for opposing China!" "The Soviet revisionists will not have a good end for opposing China!" "The British imperialists will not have a good end for opposing China!" "All those who oppose China will not have a good end!"

Revolutionary workers from various industries in the capital, including metallurgy, machinery, chemical, textile, light industry, railway, urban construction, and finance and trade, most resolutely support the just struggle of Hong Kong Chinese workers and compatriots. Broad revolutionary workers sternly pointed out: The Hong Kong British authorities used brutal repression, committing heinous crimes against our Hong Kong compatriots, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. Workers from Beijing's No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, Beijing Coking Plant, Beijing Hoisting Machinery Factory, and Beijing Glass Factory angrily said, "The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. The British authorities' bloody repression only shows their weakness and will absolutely not intimidate the Hong Kong compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They warmly praised the heroic deeds of Hong Kong patriots who, in the face of British military and police violence, fearlessly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations. They said, this fully embodies the fearless heroism of the Chinese people. Hong Kong patriots are truly the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland educated by Mao Zedong Thought! Broad revolutionary workers sternly pointed out: The British government must immediately and unconditionally accept the solemn demands proposed in the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, otherwise, the Chinese working class will not agree!

The Chinese staff working at the British Office in China also participated in the demonstration and march today and handed a protest letter to the British diplomatic officials on the spot. The protest letter pointed out: The British government has always followed the U.S. imperialists in invading Vietnam and opposing China, collaborating with the U.S. imperialists in their aggressive war in Vietnam, and has always been hostile to the Chinese people. Ignoring the repeated solemn warnings of the Chinese government, they continue to use Hong Kong as a base for the U.S. imperialists to invade Vietnam. This time, the Hong Kong British authorities' bloody repression of Chinese workers and residents makes us extremely indignant and strongly protest.

Many Red Guards and revolutionary students from Beijing's universities and colleges surged to the British Office like a tide today, singing new battle songs. Many propaganda vehicles continuously read one protest letter after another. The warriors of the East Is Red Commune of Beijing Mining Academy said, the great proletarian cultural revolution of China is an irresistible torrent, and the heroic Chinese people are invincible in the world. The great Chinese people are not afraid of gods, ghosts, the U.S. imperialists, or the Soviet revisionists, so why should we be afraid of you, the British imperialists? If the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities insist on their ways, they will definitely not have a good end!

Many overseas Chinese students returning from Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, and Vietnam also came to the British Office to demonstrate today. They strongly stated that our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out, "Our Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with our enemies." We vow to be the backbone of Hong Kong patriots and are determined to carry this struggle through to the end!

"Firmly support the heroic and just struggle of Hong Kong Chinese workers!" "Down with the U.S. imperialists! Down with the Soviet revisionists! Down with the British imperialists, the running dogs of the U.S. imperialists!" Today, some international friends and foreign experts in Beijing also joined the revolutionary masses of the capital to demonstrate and march in front of the British Office. They shouted slogans in different languages. Members of the Malaysian National Liberation League's delegation in China held up banners written in both Chinese and English. The delegation leader, Sharmah, angrily said in front of the British Office in China: We, the Malaysian National Liberation League's delegation in China, represent the Malaysian people in strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong against Chinese workers. The Malaysian people firmly support the statement of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs protesting against the British atrocities. British imperialism is a common enemy of the Malaysian people and the Chinese people. He finally raised his fist and shouted, "Long live the anti-imperialist fighting friendship between the Malaysian and Chinese peoples!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"
