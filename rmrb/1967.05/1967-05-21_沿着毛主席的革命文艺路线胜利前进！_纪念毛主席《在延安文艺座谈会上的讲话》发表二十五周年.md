March Forward Victoriously Along Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary Line!
—In Commemoration of the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"

Our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was published 25 years ago. The "Talks" creatively developed Marxism-Leninism and correctly and comprehensively formulated the theory, line, policy, and principles of proletarian literature and art. The "Talks" is a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To help the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and revolutionary literary and art workers better study and apply the "Talks," and thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the revisionist literary and art black line represented by Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, and Qi Yan Ming, we specially select the lyrics of the "Talks" for everyone to sing.

    沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进！
    ——纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    我们伟大领袖毛主席天才的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年了。《讲话》创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，正确地、全面地制定了无产阶级文艺的理论、路线、方针和政策。《讲话》是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件。
    为了帮助广大工农兵和革命文艺工作者更好地活学活用《讲话》，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和以周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭为代表的修正主义文艺黑线，我们特选登《讲话》的语录歌，供大家传唱。
