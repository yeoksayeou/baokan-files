The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China signifies the triumph of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the country and the Party; it signifies the victory of the broad masses who grasp Mao Zedong Thought in establishing new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits to replace old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits; it signifies preventing the revisionists from usurping the Party and the government, ensuring that capitalism will not be restored in China.

The Chinese proletarian revolutionaries are seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, criticizing and overthrowing the representatives of the bourgeois reactionary line. As Comrade Lin Biao has praised, the 700 million Chinese people are moving towards the establishment of a unified ideology. This ideology can only be the correct and revolutionary Mao Zedong Thought.

The international proletariat and revolutionary people urgently need Mao Zedong Thought. If China allows the power-holders taking the capitalist road to raise the black flag of modern revisionism, which advocates "three reconciliations and one reduction," then the world proletariat and revolutionary people will lose a strong revolutionary bastion. From the perspective of world revolution, if the duty of revolutionaries in countries that have not yet seized power is to make revolution and seize power, then one of the important duties of revolutionaries in countries where the revolution has already triumphed is to support the revolutionaries in countries that have not yet seized power. Therefore, countries that have already achieved revolutionary victory must prevent revisionism. To achieve this, Mao Zedong Thought must lead the way. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a guarantee of this.

Today, the Soviet Union is doing the opposite on the world stage.

The people of Latin America have personally experienced the shameful betrayal of Soviet modern revisionism. The Soviet revisionists acknowledge that Latin America is within the sphere of influence of U.S. imperialism and recognize the hegemony of U.S. imperialism in Latin America. This is the Soviet revisionists openly serving U.S. imperialism in enslaving the people of Latin America and serving the anti-national and anti-people's regimes there.

The Soviet revisionists acknowledge U.S. hegemony over Latin America, gaining some rights to participate in the development of Latin American countries, which means they are grabbing the leftovers of U.S. imperialist plunder.

Brazilian revolutionaries clearly understand the reactionary role the Soviet revisionists are playing in Brazil today. During the João Goulart government, because this government made some, albeit inconsistent, gestures of resistance against the Johnson administration, it aroused the displeasure of U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionist group then also provided only symbolic and conditional support. The Soviet leadership even urged the Goulart government to carry out certain reforms according to U.S. suggestions, which means accepting U.S. imperialism's control over Latin America under the "Alliance for Progress."

After the collapse of the Goulart government, a dictatorship was established that directly serves U.S. imperialism and its domestic agents, the large landowners and capitalists. However, relations between the Soviet Union and Brazil became closer, even signing a $100 million agreement with the Castelo Branco government to provide machinery and equipment.

This is the shameful act of a socialist country betraying the interests of the world's people after being usurped by revisionists.

From the shameful betrayal of Soviet modern revisionism, people see more and more the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China for the world revolution.

The complete and thorough victory of Mao Zedong Thought in China is a prerequisite for the victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world, and it is the basic condition for the people of all countries to achieve final victory in their struggles against imperialism, revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. The people of Brazil and the people of Latin American countries are overjoyed to hail the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

    毛泽东思想红旗定将插遍全世界
    巴西共产党中央委员　贝奈蒂托·卡尔瓦略
    中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展意味着毛泽东思想在全国和全党的胜利；意味着掌握毛泽东思想的广大群众树立新思想、新文化、新风俗和新习惯，取代旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯的胜利；意味着防止修正主义篡党、篡政，使资本主义不能在中国复辟。
    中国无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，批判并斗倒资产阶级反动路线的代表人物，正象林彪同志赞扬的那样，七亿中国人民正在走向建立统一的思想。这思想只能是正确的、革命的毛泽东思想。
    国际无产阶级和革命人民也迫切需要毛泽东思想。如果中国允许走资本主义道路当权派树起竭力推行“三和一少”的现代修正主义黑旗，那末世界无产阶级和革命人民就会失去一个坚强的革命堡垒。从世界革命的角度来看，如果今天还没有夺取政权的国家的革命者的职责是革命，是夺取政权，那末，革命已经胜利的国家的革命者的一个重要职责，就是支援还没有夺取政权的国家的革命者。因此，已经取得革命胜利的国家，必须杜绝走修正主义道路。要做到这一点，就需要毛泽东思想来领导。中国无产阶级文化大革命就是这方面的一个保证。
    苏联今天在全世界的所作所为恰恰相反。
    拉丁美洲人民从自己的亲身经历中认识到了苏联现代修正主义的可耻的背叛行为。苏修承认拉丁美洲是美帝国主义的势力范围，承认美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的霸权。这是苏修公开为美帝国主义奴役拉丁美洲人民效劳，也是为那儿的反民族、反人民的制度效劳。
    苏修承认了美帝对拉丁美洲的霸权，捞到了一些参加开发拉丁美洲国家的权利，也就是捞取美帝国主义掠夺的残羹剩饭。
    巴西革命者清楚地懂得苏修目前在巴西所扮演的反动的角色。在若奥·古拉特政府时代，因为这个政府作了少量的、不是一贯的抵制约翰逊政府的姿态，引起美帝国主义的不满。苏修集团于是也停留在一般象征性的、附着种种保留的支持。苏修领导甚至要古拉特政府按照美国建议进行某些改革，也就是接受美帝国主义的控制拉丁美洲的“争取进步联盟”。
    古拉特政府垮台后，建立起直接为美帝国主义和它的国内代理人大地主和大资本家效劳的独裁政权，苏联和巴西的关系却变得密切了，甚至同卡斯特卢·布朗库政府签订了一个价值一亿美元的议定书，提供机器设备。
    这就是一个社会主义国家在被修正主义篡党、篡政后干出的出卖世界人民利益的无耻勾当。
    人们从苏联现代修正主义的无耻背叛中，越来越看到中国无产阶级文化大革命对于世界革命的重大意义。
    毛泽东思想在中国全面彻底的胜利，是毛泽东思想在全世界胜利的前提，是各国人民在反对帝国主义，反对修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，取得最后胜利的基本条件。巴西人民和拉丁美洲各国人民无比高兴地欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
