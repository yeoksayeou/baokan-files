In the decisive stage of the seizure of power by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and in the struggle to criticize the party's top anti-revolutionary clique, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Instruments and Telecommunications achieved the first "three-in-one" combination in the city's industrial and transportation system. They formally established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ—the Bureau Revolutionary Committee. This is another significant victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought on the industrial and transportation front in Shanghai.

How can the leading organs of the industrial and transportation system achieve the "three-in-one" combination more quickly and effectively? The practical struggles of the proletarian revolutionaries in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Instruments and Telecommunications system provide experience in solving this problem. Their experience can be summarized as follows: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, under the correct leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, continuously overcome non-proletarian ideological tendencies, persistently carry out the struggle between the two lines, achieve revolutionary great unity based on industry in the struggle, and achieve the "three-in-one" combination on the basis of great unity.

Great unity is a necessary prerequisite for the "three-in-one" combination.

The proletarian revolutionaries in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Instruments and Telecommunications system were among the first to rebel on the industrial and transportation front in Shanghai. During the January Revolution storm, the revolutionary forces at the grassroots level of this industrial bureau system first united based on industry; the revolutionary forces in the bureau headquarters quickly established a unified revolutionary mass organization and united with the grassroots revolutionary forces, forming a vast army of cultural revolution. The realization of revolutionary great unity provided the necessary prerequisite conditions for the entire bureau system to achieve the "three-in-one" combination.

This industrial bureau system has more than a hundred enterprises and institutions. During the period when the bourgeois reactionary line was rampant, the revolutionary masses at the grassroots level broke through numerous obstacles to establish some cross-industry and cross-unit revolutionary mass organizations, which played a significant role in the struggle. As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepened, these revolutionary mass organizations, due to lack of coordination and even mutual opposition, increasingly became obstacles to completing new combat missions, urgently requiring unity based on industry. However, they had already joined various independent "headquarters" or "branches." How to handle the original organizational relationships? In heated discussions, everyone used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticized small-groupism and sectarianism, clearly recognized that everything must be for the overall interests of the revolution, and organizational tasks must be subordinate to political tasks. Thus, the proletarian revolutionaries of forty-eight factories first united to establish the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Instruments and Telecommunications System (Revolutionary Rebel) General Liaison Station. With the development of the struggle, more grassroots unit revolutionary mass organizations successively joined the General Liaison Station, and the class forces organized based on industry grew stronger.

The bureau headquarters originally had two revolutionary mass organizations, which later developed into more than a dozen. The proletarian revolutionaries, based on the needs of the struggle, demanded the establishment of a unified revolutionary mass organization. However, a small number of stubborn conservatives carried out splittist and disruptive activities, and the struggle between the two lines was intense. The proletarian revolutionaries followed Chairman Mao's teachings, striving to achieve revolutionary great unity and resolutely opposing unprincipled "big compromises." They took the most resolute and clear-cut revolutionary leftists as the core, united with other revolutionary organizations to take joint action, correctly treated conservative organizations, patiently helped the deceived masses, united all forces that could be united, and defeated attempts to drive a wedge between political cadres and technical cadres, and between leading cadres and ordinary cadres. Under this situation, a unified revolutionary mass organization—the Headquarters Revolutionary Rebel Corps—was successfully established within the headquarters (including four companies). In the joint struggle to deeply criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, batch after batch of deceived people returned to the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao.

Utilizing the favorable conditions of upper and lower unity to lay the foundation for the "three-in-one" combination

In the process of achieving revolutionary great unity between the grassroots revolutionary forces and the headquarters revolutionary forces, they fought side by side and jointly completed a series of struggle tasks, deepening mutual understanding and establishing revolutionary combat friendship. At the critical moment when the entire bureau system was severely paralyzed by the counter-revolutionary economic wind, they resolutely took joint action and jointly seized the leadership of the bureau (including companies). The revolutionary fighters, under the condition of a unified direction, further implemented the unity between the grassroots revolutionary forces and the headquarters revolutionary forces, timely established a provisional takeover committee composed of leaders of grassroots revolutionary mass organizations, leaders of headquarters revolutionary mass organizations, and revolutionary leading cadres of the bureau, seized the power of the party, government, finance, and culture throughout the system, quickly improved the production command system from the bureau to the factory, earnestly implemented the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and at the same time thwarted the counter-revolutionary seizure of power plot, laying a reliable foundation for the realization of the "three-in-one" combination.

The grassroots revolutionary forces and the headquarters revolutionary forces united, utilizing the favorable conditions of upper and lower unity, observed problems from different angles, concentrated the materials they respectively mastered, timely analyzed the overall situation of the struggle in the entire bureau system, and appropriately organized and allocated forces, unified the steps of the struggle. Thus, they more comprehensively and deeply exposed the class struggle cover of the entire bureau system, identified who were the handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road, and determined the targets for key strikes.

The grassroots revolutionary forces and the headquarters revolutionary forces united, utilizing the favorable conditions of upper and lower unity, examined cadres from multiple aspects, focusing on the class analysis of leading cadres. Some leading cadres and middle-level cadres of the bureau and companies had said and done some wrong things at the grassroots level. The headquarters revolutionary forces paid great attention to the opinions of the grassroots revolutionary forces on the "specific incidents" of these cadres; while the "entire history and entire work" of these cadres were difficult for the grassroots to grasp, the grassroots revolutionary forces also believed the introductions and evaluations of the headquarters revolutionary forces on the relevant situations. Thus, the revolutionary forces quickly unified their understanding of these cadres, correctly distinguished and treated them, and did in-depth and detailed ideological work to help some cadres bravely stand up for the revolution.

The grassroots revolutionary forces and the headquarters revolutionary forces united, utilizing the favorable conditions of upper and lower unity, quickly implemented various preparatory items for the establishment of the temporary power organ, and smoothly completed the work of ideological fermentation, organizational preparation, and member selection from multiple aspects.

Correctly treating revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses

Although the necessary prerequisites and reliable foundations for implementing the "three-in-one" combination have been established, in how to correctly treat revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, it is still necessary to experience the struggle between the two thoughts and the two lines. One opinion from the grassroots said, "We don't trust the cadres," advocating that "there should be more worker representatives in the temporary power organ." After learning and discussing, many revolutionary fighters realized that this opinion lacked class analysis. Revolutionary cadres, especially revolutionary leading cadres, are precious assets of the party and the people. Excluding headquarters revolutionary cadres would fundamentally make it impossible to seize the leadership power of the bureau and companies, which is actually a reflection of the bourgeois reactionary trend of "doubt everything, exclude everything, overthrow everything." Some revolutionary worker comrades said well: The number of worker representatives is not the main sign of whether the leadership power is truly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries who resolutely act according to Mao Zedong Thought. They said, as long as the power is truly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary leading cadres, we are at ease. Another ideological obstacle came from within the bureau headquarters. Regarding the issue of whether grassroots unit revolutionary mass representatives should participate in the temporary power organ, two different opinions emerged. Some people thought: The industrial bureau belongs to the category of party and government organs; according to the principle of establishing temporary power organs in party and government organs, it is not necessary to have grassroots revolutionary mass representatives participate in the bureau's temporary power organ. The majority opinion was: The new revolutionary mass representatives are new forces nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle for power, they dared to forge ahead and made great contributions, which cannot be erased. The attitude towards grassroots revolutionary mass representatives actually reflects the attitude towards the revolutionary mass movement and the attitude towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These comrades, based on reality, put forward three reasons for why grassroots revolutionary mass representatives should participate in the bureau's temporary power organ:

1. The industrial bureau is different from general party and government organs. The bureau headquarters and the grassroots factories have inseparable relationships in party, government, finance, culture, production technology, and other aspects. With the participation of grassroots revolutionary mass representatives, the bureau's temporary power organ can have broad representativeness and truly establish proletarian authority, which is conducive to effectively exercising power throughout the system and also conducive to the work of the headquarters obtaining support and supervision from the grassroots.

2. The grassroots revolutionary masses live and fight on the front line, and they have a keen sense of new things and high revolutionary enthusiasm and initiative. The participation of grassroots revolutionary mass representatives in the bureau's temporary power organ, learning from and complementing each other with headquarters revolutionary cadres, is very beneficial for timely understanding of the grassroots situation, grasping the pulse of the masses, changing some old styles of the headquarters, especially for cultivating new forces.

3. The grassroots revolutionary forces and the headquarters revolutionary forces have been united and fighting together for several months. The participation of grassroots revolutionary mass representatives in the bureau's temporary power organ is conducive to consolidating and developing the revolutionary friendship that has been established.

The two different opinions, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, gradually tended to unify: The headquarters revolutionary cadres should be the main body of the composition of the bureau's temporary power organ, and the grassroots revolutionary mass representatives (including leaders of grassroots revolutionary mass organizations) should also participate in the industrial bureau's temporary power organ. This is completely in line with the spirit of the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and completely meets the needs of actual struggles.

Great criticism accelerated the steps of the "three-in-one" combination

Recently, the proletarian revolutionaries in this industrial bureau system have launched a revolutionary great criticism against the handful of power-holders within the party who take the capitalist road and their bourgeois reactionary line, especially against the component of the bourgeois reactionary line in the cadre issue of "striking a large piece and protecting a small clique." Through the great criticism, many leading cadres deeply realized the great historical significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, further found the reasons for their mistakes, and quickly returned to the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao; the broad revolutionary masses more firmly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, daring to "strike a small clique" and "liberate a large piece." This good situation further accelerated the steps of realizing the "three-in-one" combination, and the establishment of the temporary power organ has become inevitable.

According to the repeated discussions from top to bottom, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Instruments and Telecommunications Revolutionary Committee is composed of thirty-one members, including six revolutionary leading cadres of the bureau (including section chiefs and company managers), seven revolutionary cadre representatives of the headquarters (bureau and companies), and fifteen grassroots revolutionary mass representatives (including old workers, young workers, female workers, technical personnel, model workers, active learners of Chairman Mao's works, leaders of grassroots revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary leading cadres of grassroots factories, etc.), and three military representatives. The Standing Committee is composed of eleven members, with the revolutionary leading cadres of the bureau as the main body and also serving as the "first-in-command," and with the participation of headquarters revolutionary cadre representatives, grassroots revolutionary mass representatives, and military representatives. The members of the Bureau Revolutionary Committee, except those participating in the Standing Committee, are not full-time; the grassroots revolutionary mass representatives in the Standing Committee are also not full-time. The selection of revolutionary leading cadres participating in the "three-in-one" combination was determined after repeated examination and discussion by the revolutionary masses of the headquarters and grassroots. The headquarters revolutionary cadre representatives and grassroots revolutionary mass representatives were selected after multiple fermentations and discussions. They have a certain prestige among the masses and are supported and endorsed by the masses.

The proletarian revolutionaries in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Instruments and Telecommunications system are clearly aware that the establishment of the temporary power organ is only the first step of a long march; there are still some shortcomings in the work that need to be overcome, and new, more arduous tasks await completion. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out the revolutionary great criticism more extensively and deeply, to promote the struggle-criticism-transformation throughout the system, to further realize the revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one" combination in more grassroots units, to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, to further implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and to truly turn the entire system into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    在斗争中实现按产业系统的革命大联合
    在大联合的基础上实现革命的“三结合”
    上海市仪表电讯工业局成立革命委员会取得了按产业系统实行革命“三结合”的经验
    据新华社上海七日电　在无产阶级革命派联合夺权的决战阶段，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行群众性大批判的斗争中，上海市仪表电讯工业局在全市工业交通系统中第一个实现了革命的“三结合”，正式成立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——局革命委员会。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在上海工业交通战线上又一个新的重大胜利。
    工业交通系统的领导机关，怎样才能较快较好地实现革命的“三结合”？上海市仪表电讯工业局系统无产阶级革命派的斗争实践，为解决这个问题提供了经验。他们的经验集中到一点，就是：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，在市革命委员会的正确领导下，不断克服非无产阶级思想倾向，始终坚持两条路线的斗争，在斗争中实现按产业系统的革命大联合，在大联合的基础上实现革命的“三结合”。
           大联合是革命的“三结合”的必要前提
    仪表电讯工业局系统的无产阶级革命派，是上海工业交通战线上最早起来造反的队伍之一。在“一月革命”风暴中，这个工业局系统的基层单位的革命派，首先按产业系统联合了起来；局机关的革命派，也随即建立了统一的革命群众组织，并且同基层的革命派联合起来，形成了浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。革命大联合的实现，为整个工业局系统实现革命的“三结合”，提供了必要的前提条件。
    这个工业局系统有一百多个企业和事业单位。在资产阶级反动路线猖獗一时的日子里，基层的革命派战士冲破重重罗网，建立了一些跨行跨业跨单位的革命群众组织，在斗争中发挥了很大作用。随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，这些革命群众组织由于步调不一，甚至相互对立，越来越成为完成新的战斗任务的障碍，迫切要求按产业系统联合起来。可是，它们已经分别参加了各自独立的“总部”或“分部”。怎么处理原来的组织关系呢？在热烈的讨论中，大家以毛泽东思想为武器，大破小团体主义和风头主义，明确认识到，一切为了革命的全局利益，组织任务必须服从于政治任务。于是，四十八个工厂的无产阶级革命派，首先联合建立了上海市仪表电讯工业局系统（革命造反派）总联络站。随着斗争的胜利发展，更多的基层单位的革命群众组织陆续加入总联络站，按产业系统组织的阶级队伍日益发展壮大起来。
    仪表电讯工业局机关原来有两个革命群众组织，后来发展到十几个。无产阶级革命派根据斗争的需要，要求建立统一的革命群众组织，极少数顽固的保守分子却进行分裂破坏活动，两条路线的斗争十分激烈。无产阶级革命派遵循毛主席的教导，努力实行革命的大联合，坚决反对无原则的“大凑合”。他们以斗争最坚决、立场最鲜明的革命左派为核心，联合其他革命组织共同行动，同时正确对待保守组织，耐心帮助受蒙蔽的群众，团结了一切可以团结的力量，击败了离间政治工作干部和业务工作干部的关系、领导干部和一般干部的关系的企图。在这个形势下，局机关（包括四个公司）内胜利建立了统一的革命群众组织——机关革命造反大队。在深入批判资产阶级反动路线的共同斗争中，一批又一批受蒙蔽的人回到了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。
       运用上下结合的有利条件，为革命“三结合”奠立基础
    基层单位革命派和局机关革命派分别实现革命大联合的过程中，并肩作战，共同完成了一系列的斗争任务，增进了彼此的了解，建立了革命的战斗友谊。在反革命经济主义妖风造成整个工业局系统严重瘫痪的紧张时刻，他们毅然采取联合行动，共同接管了局（包括公司）的领导权。革命派战士在大方向一致的情况下，进一步实行了基层革命派和机关革命派的联合，及时组成了由基层革命群众组织负责人、机关革命群众组织负责人和局的革命领导干部参加的临时接管委员会，掌握整个系统的党、政、财、文大权，迅速健全了从局到厂的生产指挥系统，认真贯彻了“抓革命，促生产”的方针，同时击退了反夺权的阴谋，为实现革命的“三结合”奠定了可靠的基础。
    基层革命派和机关革命派联合在一起，运用上下结合的有利条件，从不同的角度观察问题，集中各自掌握的材料，及时对整个工业局系统的斗争形势进行全面的分析，并且适当组织和调配力量，统一斗争步骤，从而比较全面深入地揭开了整个工业局系统的阶级斗争盖子，认清了谁是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，确定了重点打击的目标。
    基层革命派和机关革命派联合在一起，运用上下结合的有利条件，从多方面考察干部，着重对领导干部进行了阶级分析。局和公司的一些领导干部和中层干部，在基层说过一些错话，做过一些错事。机关革命派很重视基层革命派对这些干部“一时一事”的看法和意见；而这些干部的“全部历史和全部工作”，基层比较难以掌握，基层革命派也相信机关革命派对有关情况的介绍和评价。这样，革命派就比较快地统一了对这些干部的认识，正确地区别对待，并且做深入细致的思想工作，帮助一些干部勇敢地站起来革命。
    基层革命派和机关革命派联合在一起，还运用上下结合的有利条件，尽快落实了建立临时权力机构的各项筹备事项，比较顺利地完成了思想酝酿、组织准备、委员人选等多方面的工作。
              正确对待革命干部和革命群众
    实行革命的“三结合”，虽然已经具备了必要的前提和可靠的基础，但是要真正建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”的临时权力机构，在如何正确对待革命干部和革命群众的问题上，还不能不经历两种思想、两条路线的斗争。来自基层的一种意见说，“对干部信不过”，主张“临时权力机构中要多有几名工人代表”。经过学习和讨论，很多革命派战士认识到：这种意见，缺乏阶级分析。革命干部，特别是革命的领导干部，是党和人民的宝贵财富。排斥机关革命干部，根本无法掌握局和公司的领导实权，这实际上是“怀疑一切，排斥一切，打倒一切”的资产阶级反动思潮的一种反映。有些革命派工人说得好：工人代表的多少，并不是领导权是否真正掌握在坚决按照毛泽东思想办事的无产阶级革命派手里的主要标志。他们说，只要权真正掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里，掌握在革命的领导干部手里，我们就放心了。另一种思想阻力，来自局机关内部。围绕基层单位革命群众代表要不要参加临时权力机构的问题，出现了两种不同的意见。一部分人认为：工业局属于党政机关的范畴；根据党政机关建立临时权力机构的原则，不一定要有基层革命群众代表参加局的临时权力机构。大多数人的意见是：新起的革命群众的代表人物，是毛泽东思想哺育起来的新生力量。在夺权斗争中，他们敢闯敢干，立下了功勋，这是决不能抹煞的。对待基层革命群众代表的态度，实际上反映了对待革命群众运动的态度，反映了对待文化大革命的态度。这些同志从实际出发，对基层革命群众代表应该参加局的临时权力机构，提出了三点理由：
      （一）工业局不同于一般党政机关。局机关同基层工厂，在党、政、财、文、生产技术等各方面，都有着不可分割的关系。有了基层革命群众代表参加，局的临时权力机构就能具有广泛的代表性，就能真正树立无产阶级权威，从而有利于在整个系统有效地行使权力，也有利于机关的各项工作得到基层的支持和监督。
      （二）基层革命群众，生活在第一线，战斗在第一线，他们对新鲜事物有敏锐的感觉，有高度的革命热情和积极性。基层革命群众代表参加局的临时权力机构，同机关革命干部互相学习，取长补短，对于最及时地了解基层的情况，掌握群众的脉搏，改变过去机关的一些旧作风，特别是对培养新生力量，都大有好处。
      （三）基层革命派和机关革命派，几个月来一直团结在一起，战斗在一起。基层革命群众代表参加局的临时权力机构，有利于巩固和发展已经建立起来的革命友谊。
    两种不同意见经过辩论，在毛泽东思想的指导下，逐步趋于统一：机关革命干部应当是组成局临时权力机构的主体，而基层革命群众代表（包括基层革命群众组织负责人）也应当参加工业局的临时权力机构。这样做，完全符合毛主席和党中央的最新指示精神，完全适应实际斗争的需要。
             大批判加快了革命“三结合”的步伐
    最近，这个工业局系统的无产阶级革命派，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们提出的资产阶级反动路线，展开了革命的大批判，特别是对在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分，展开了进一步的批判。通过大批判，不少领导干部深刻认识到了文化大革命的伟大历史意义，进一步找到了自己犯错误的原因，迅速地回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来；广大革命群众更加坚定地执行毛主席的干部政策，勇于“打击一小撮”，敢于“解放一大片”。这个大好形势，更进一步加快了实现革命“三结合”的步伐，成立临时权力机构已经水到渠成。
    根据上上下下多次反复讨论，上海市仪表电讯工业局革命委员会确定由三十一名委员组成，其中局革命领导干部（包括处长和公司经理）六人，机关（局和公司）革命干部代表七人，基层革命群众代表（包括老工人、青年工人、女工、技术人员、五好职工、学习毛主席著作积极分子、基层革命群众组织负责人、基层工厂革命领导干部等）十五人，解放军代表三人。常务委员由十一人组成，以局的革命领导干部为主体，并且担任“第一把手”，还有机关革命干部代表、基层革命群众代表和解放军代表参加。局革命委员会的委员，除参加常委会的以外，都不脱产；常委中的基层革命群众代表，也不脱产。参加“三结合”的革命领导干部的人选，是由机关和基层的革命群众反复审查讨论以后确定的。机关革命干部代表和基层革命群众代表，都是多次酝酿讨论以后推选的。他们在群众中具有一定的威信，受到群众的支持和拥护。
    上海市仪表电讯工业局系统的无产阶级革命派清醒地认识到，临时权力机构的成立，还只是万里长征的第一步；工作中的一些缺点还有待于克服，新的更为艰巨的任务还有待于完成。他们决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加广泛深入地开展群众性的革命大批判，推进整个系统的斗批改，促使更多的基层单位进一步实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，进一步贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把整个系统真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
