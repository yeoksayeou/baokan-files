    The Permanent Bureau of the Afro-Asian Writers' Association today issued a statement strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by British imperialists in Hong Kong, fully supporting the solemn demands made in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, and the just demands of the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong.

    The statement points out that the British authorities in Hong Kong have gone so far as to use bloody suppression and violence against unarmed Chinese workers and residents. The heinous crimes committed by the British government are not only a provocation against the great seven hundred million Chinese people but also a provocation against the peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world.

    The statement emphasizes that the bloody atrocities committed by the British government in Hong Kong are not isolated incidents. In fact, they are part of the British government's conspiracy with U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people and the peoples of Asia and Africa. It is well known that the British government has long been involved in the U.S. imperialists' criminal war of aggression against Vietnam and has turned Hong Kong into a base for U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. At the same time, it has taken various measures hostile to China in Hong Kong, attempting to resist the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. In recent days, despite the unanimous condemnation of the revolutionary peoples of the world, the British authorities in Hong Kong have further escalated the situation and continued to use violent means to brutally suppress the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong.

    The statement points out that the actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong clearly show that the British imperialists are closely coordinating their anti-China activities with those of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

    The statement says that we must remind the British government: the era when British imperialists could do as they pleased in Asia and Africa has long passed.

    The statement says that the great leader of the world revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao Zedong, said: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no power whatsoever." The bloody suppression by the British authorities in Hong Kong will absolutely not frighten the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong who are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We are firmly convinced that, with the great seven hundred million Chinese people as a powerful backing, and with the strong support of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and the world, the heroic and just struggle of the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong will surely achieve final victory.

    亚非作家常设局发表声明强烈谴责英帝暴行
    坚决支持中国对港英当局的严正要求
    指出英国政府在香港制造的血腥事件，是它勾结美帝反对中国人民和亚非人民阴谋的一部分
    新华社二十九日讯　亚非作家常设局今天发表声明，强烈谴责英帝国主义者在香港的法西斯暴行，完全支持中华人民共和国外交部声明中的严正要求，和香港中国工人和居民的正当要求。
    声明指出，香港英国当局竟然疯狂到使用血腥镇压的暴力手段来对付手无寸铁的香港中国工人和居民。英国政府所犯下的这些滔天罪行，不仅是对伟大的七亿中国人民的挑衅，也是对爱好和平、自由的亚非人民和世界人民的挑衅。
    声明强调说，英国政府在香港制造的血腥暴行绝不是孤立的。实际上，它是英国政府勾结美帝反对中国人民和亚非人民阴谋的一部分。众所周知，英国政府长期以来一直参与美帝国主义罪恶的侵越战争，并把香港变成了美帝国主义的侵越基地；同时，它还在香港采取了敌视中国的种种措施，妄图抵制中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响。近日来，香港英国当局不顾世界革命人民的同声谴责，竟然扩大事态，继续用暴力手段疯狂镇压香港的中国工人和居民。
    声明指出，香港英国当局的这个行动清楚地表明，英帝国主义者正在密切地配合美帝和苏修的反华活动。
    声明说，我们要提醒英国政府：英帝国主义者在亚洲、非洲为所欲为的时代早已一去不复返了。
    声明说，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”香港英国当局的血腥镇压绝对吓不倒用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国工人和居民。我们坚信：有着伟大的七亿中国人民作强大的后盾，有着亚非人民和世界人民的大力支持，香港中国工人和居民英勇和正义的斗争必将取得最后的胜利。
