Today, our newspaper published the experience of the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region's 4672 Unit conducting military and political training at Beijing Normal University and supporting the leftists. This experience is excellent and worthy of promotion.

Military and political training in colleges and universities is being carried out under the personal care of our great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao instructed us: Sending military cadres to train revolutionary students is a good method. Training makes a big difference compared to not training. This way, one can learn politics, military affairs, the Four Firsts, the Three-Eight Style, the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention from the PLA, and strengthen organizational discipline.

Chairman Mao also instructed: The military should, in batches, conduct military training for universities, middle schools, and high-grade elementary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing three-in-one leadership bodies, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. First conduct pilot projects, gain experience, and gradually promote them.

Chairman Mao's wise instructions have added new and important content to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities nationwide, marking another great initiative of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with great strategic significance.

Revolutionary teachers and students in colleges and universities enthusiastically support Chairman Mao's instructions. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions.

During the military and political training, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the PLA, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, closely cooperate with revolutionary teachers and students, and wholeheartedly do a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities. Their achievements are primary, and the general direction is correct. In their work, they have shortcomings and mistakes, but they can humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, seriously conduct self-criticism, and promptly correct them. They have received the enthusiastic welcome and firm support of the revolutionary teachers and students.

The comrades of the PLA who carried out military and political training tasks at Beijing Normal University have set a good example in this regard and provided rich experience.

Conducting military and political training must support the leftists and rely on the leftists. Revolutionary leftists are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the most resolute defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They embody the revolutionary direction. Every cadre and soldier participating in military and political training must have the stance, thoughts, and feelings of the leftists. At the same time, they must conduct investigations and class analysis, and be good at identifying and discovering leftists. Only in this way can they, in the struggle between the two lines, stand firm and hold high the banner; only in this way can they support and rely on the leftists, unite the majority, and make military and political training advance along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

Taking the struggle between the two lines as the key link, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, and promoting ideological revolutionization are the fundamental tasks of military and political training. Military and political training should be led by political training, with politics in command. Politics in command means Mao Zedong Thought in command. Only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought, this weapon of boundless power, can the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students successfully criticize and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and successfully carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units. This requires organizing the broad masses of teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's relevant works seriously with the problems in the struggle between the two lines. Only when they truly delve into it and put it into practice can it be said that military and political training has achieved results. If this aspect of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is not grasped tightly and well, various erroneous thoughts, such as anarchism, factionalism, cliquism, opportunism, and individualism, cannot be eliminated from the mind, then military and political training will become formalistic and cannot fundamentally achieve the goal of improving the leftist forces and the broad masses.

Grasping and solving active ideological issues thoroughly and patiently is an important link to achieving unity among the majority. The PLA should, in combination with the actual situation of the cultural revolution in schools, use Mao Zedong Thought to solve various ideological problems within the leftist forces, and solve various ideological problems among cadres who have made mistakes and among the masses who have been deceived. They should repeatedly persuade the revolutionary leftists to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, understand the truth that the proletariat can only liberate all mankind to finally liberate itself, and act accordingly. They should correctly handle leftist organizations that have made mistakes and correctly handle the masses who have joined conservative organizations, strengthen political and ideological work for them, and not exclude or discriminate against them. They should help the revolutionary leftists master the solid skills of doing mass work, be good at grasping the pulse of the masses' thoughts, seize various ideological tendencies, use heart-to-heart talks to carry out ideological mutual assistance; be good at turning Chairman Mao's thoughts and the Party's policies into the thoughts and policies of the broad masses. Let the masses educate themselves and liberate themselves.

Comrades participating in military and political training must take believing in the masses and relying on the masses as the fundamental requirement for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. To achieve revolutionary great unity in schools, the principle of "clear banner, persistent struggle, possessing conditions, and paying attention to methods" must be adhered to. Both the spirit of seizing the day and the night and not being overly hasty and seeking quick results are required.

The broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students should enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, humbly learn from the PLA, closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, unite as one, do a good job in military and political training in colleges and universities, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities through to the end!

### 军政训练好

    军政训练好
    今天，本报发表了人民解放军北京部队4672部队，在北京师范大学进行军政训练、支持左派的经验。这个经验很好，值得推广。
    大中学校的军政训练，是在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下进行的。
    毛主席指示我们：派军队干部训练革命师生的方法很好。训练一下和不训练大不一样。这样做，可以向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性。
    毛主席还指示：军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。先作试点，取得经验，逐步推广。
    毛主席的这些英明指示，给全国大中学校的无产阶级文化大革命增加了新的重要内容，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一伟大创举，具有伟大的战略意义。
    大中学校广大革命师生最热烈地拥护毛主席的指示。人民解放军的广大干部战士最坚决地执行了毛主席的指示。
    在军政训练过程中，解放军的广大干部战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，和广大革命师生密切合作，全心全意地搞好大中学校的无产阶级文化大革命。他们的成绩是主要的，大方向是正确的。他们在工作中有了缺点错误，能够虚心听取群众的意见，认真进行自我批评，及时加以纠正。他们受到了广大革命师生的热情欢迎和坚决支持。
    在北京师范大学执行军政训练任务的解放军同志，在这方面树立了良好的榜样，提供了丰富的经验。
    进行军政训练，一定要支持左派，依靠左派。革命左派是无产阶级文化大革命的先锋，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最坚决的捍卫者，他们体现了革命的大方向。每一个参加军政训练的干部战士，自己必须具有左派的立场，左派的思想，左派的感情。同时还要进行调查研究和阶级分析，善于识别左派和发现左派。只有这样，才能在两条路线的斗争中，做到立场坚定，旗帜鲜明；才能做到支持左派，依靠左派，团结大多数，使军政训练沿着毛主席指引的航道前进。
    以两条路线斗争为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，促进思想革命化，是军政训练的根本任务。军政训练，应该是政治训练带头，用政治来挂帅。政治挂帅，就是毛泽东思想挂帅。广大革命师生只有掌握了毛泽东思想这个威力无穷的武器，才能够胜利地对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行大批判、大斗争，才能胜利地进行本单位的斗、批、改。这就一定要很好地组织广大师生，带着两条路线斗争中的问题，坐下来认真学习毛主席的有关著作。真正钻进去了，见诸行动了，那就说明军政训练确有成效了。如果活学活用毛主席著作这一条抓得不紧，抓得不好，不能把各种错误思想，把无政府主义、山头主义、小团体主义、风头主义、个人主义等等非无产阶级思想，从头脑中排除掉，那么，军政训练就会流于形式，就不能从根本上达到提高左派队伍，提高广大群众的目的。
    大抓狠抓活的思想，坚持耐心的说服教育，是实现团结大多数的重要环节。解放军要结合学校文化大革命的实际情况，运用毛泽东思想解决左派队伍中的各种思想问题，解决犯错误干部和受蒙蔽群众中的各种思想问题。要反复劝说革命左派，遵循毛主席的教导，懂得无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的道理，并且按照这个道理办事。要正确地对待犯有错误的左派组织，正确地对待参加保守组织的群众，对他们要加强政治思想工作，不要排斥和歧视。要帮助革命左派学会做群众工作的过硬本领，善于掌握群众的思想脉搏，抓住各种思想苗头，运用谈心方式，开展思想互助；善于把毛主席的思想，党的政策，变为广大群众自己的思想，自己的政策。让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。
    参加军政训练的部队同志，必须把相信群众，依靠群众，作为贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的根本要求。在学校实现革命的大联合，一定要坚持“旗帜鲜明，坚持斗争，具备条件，讲究方法”的原则。既要有只争朝夕的积极精神，又不要操之过急，急于求成。
    广大的革命师生应当热烈响应毛主席的拥军爱民的伟大号召，虚心向解放军学习，和人民解放军密切合作，团结一致，把大中学校军政训练搞好，把大中学校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
