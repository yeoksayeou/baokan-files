Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine have greatly inspired the people of Beijing and Shanghai. They will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought across all cultural fronts and ensure that the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers forever stand tall on the national stage.

The great victory of the Peking Opera revolution once again demonstrates the invincibility of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art. The revolutionary masses and revolutionary literary and artistic workers are determined to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the revisionist line in literature and art and the capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party.

The workers, peasants, and Red Guards in the capital, as well as revolutionary literary and artistic workers, enthusiastically hail the victory of the Peking Opera revolution as a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. They say that on the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the publication of Jiang Qing's speech "On the Revolution of Peking Opera" and the editorial "Hail the Great Victory of the Peking Opera Revolution" in the Red Flag magazine once again powerfully demonstrates that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art is invincible, and that great Mao Zedong Thought is irresistible. If the most tightly controlled and most stubborn stronghold of reactionary revisionism, Peking Opera, can be conquered, then there is no old stronghold that cannot be destroyed. We hail the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution and, with unshakable confidence, will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to complete victory.

The revolutionary rebels of the Hua Hua Timber Factory and the Beijing Second Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory excitedly pointed out that Jiang Qing's speech is excellent; she truly speaks to the hearts of us workers! They said that this speech is an important document of the Peking Opera revolution. It pronounces the death sentence on the revisionist line in literature and art of the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's line in literature and art. The workers of the Second Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory also said that we railway workers saw the portrayal of our revolutionary heroes in "The Red Lantern," and we all felt very close to it, deeply educated and inspired. We workers welcome revolutionary modern plays. We firmly believe that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, workers, peasants, and soldiers will be the true masters of the theatrical stage, and a completely new situation will emerge in the field of culture and art.

Comrade Luo Ruihua, a member of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Assembly, said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, with the support of the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, have always used the theater stage to distort history, beautify the exploiting classes, advocate class reconciliation, and numb the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people, preventing them from rising up in revolution, so that they can dream of restoring capitalism peacefully. This is absolutely not possible! Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution has greatly boosted the morale of the proletariat, crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and greatly inspired us to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end and complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

The fighters of the "Smash the Old Beijing Municipal Committee Combat Team" angrily pointed out that for many years, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee has stubbornly pushed the revisionist line in literature and art of the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, fiercely resisting Chairman Mao's policies on literature and art, and using every means to sabotage Jiang Qing's efforts to reform the theater. They declared that they would ride the wind of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, together with proletarian revolutionaries across the city and the country, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to thoroughly criticize and expose the revisionist line in literature and art, ensuring that the stage forever belongs to workers, peasants, and soldiers, and that the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever flies high over our proletarian cultural front.

The Red Guards of the Revolutionary Committee of Higher Education Institutions in the capital said that Jiang Qing, holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, personally led the Peking Opera revolution, sounding the charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. We Red Guards are Chairman Mao's most loyal little red soldiers. We are absolutely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. No matter who it is, no matter how stubborn the stronghold, as long as it opposes Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely overthrow it. We eagerly hope that the glorious image of the Red Guards will appear on the Peking Opera stage illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary workers and students of the China Peking Opera House, Beijing Drama Academy, and the First Peking Opera Troupe of Beijing enthusiastically hailed the publication of Jiang Qing's important speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine. They are determined to thoroughly settle accounts with the old Ministry of Culture, the old Propaganda Department, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee's revisionist line in literature and art, and to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation to the end. The fighters of the "East Is Red" Commune of the China Peking Opera House said that Jiang Qing's speech and the publication of the editorial in the Red Flag magazine have made us see more clearly the direction of the Peking Opera revolution and the direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the literary and artistic circles, and have strengthened our confidence in leading the Peking Opera revolution to greater victories. They said that the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party is the biggest pillar and supporter of the reactionary revisionist forces and all the ghosts and monsters in the Peking Opera circles. He is the biggest obstacle to the Peking Opera revolution, with countless crimes that are hard to enumerate. This account must be settled today. They said that Jiang Qing, in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, has made significant contributions in the theory and practice of the Peking Opera revolution. The revolutionary model Peking Opera "The Red Lantern" is a great victory achieved by Jiang Qing leading the revolutionary forces of the China Peking Opera House in a resolute struggle against a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles and their supreme backer—the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party—and in a resolute attack on the stubborn stronghold of old forces in Peking Opera. We must cherish our model operas like we cherish our own eyes and are determined to perform revolutionary modern Peking Opera for life and propagate Mao Zedong Thought for life.

The performers of the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Ballet Troupe, who are rehearsing the revolutionary modern ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," said that under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have finally successfully staged "The Red Detachment of Women," taking a solid first step in the revolutionization of ballet. In the future, we must further study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Jiang Qing's important speech "On the Revolution of Peking Opera," making foreign things serve Chinese purposes, turning ballet into an art that defends the socialist economic base, and serving the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In Shanghai, on the day of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the publication of Jiang Qing's important speech "On the Revolution of Peking Opera" and the editorial "Hail the Great Victory of the Peking Opera Revolution" in the Red Flag magazine has brought immense inspiration to the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Shanghai. They most enthusiastically hail that under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and artistic workers have seized back the power over culture and art and the stage of Peking Opera from the handful of capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party and the reactionary "authorities" in the academic circles; they most enthusiastically hail that Peking Opera, this ancient traditional drama, has appeared in the garden of the proletariat with a new revolutionary face, and is advancing vigorously with an immeasurable great influence, making the entire socialist literature and art full of vitality. They are full of confidence and declare that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, with an even more high-spirited revolutionary fighting posture, throw themselves into the decisive battle of the two classes, two roads, and two lines, thoroughly smash and destroy the revisionist line in literature and art, thoroughly criticize and expose the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, and let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine over the entire cultural and artistic front! Let the contemporary revolutionary heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers forever stand tall on the stage of New China!

Today, many factories, people's communes, military units, schools, and artistic troupes in Shanghai, in connection with the fierce struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic circles, are holding symposiums to discuss and study Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine. Hundreds of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda squads participating in the Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Literary and Art Performance have, based on the spirit of these two important documents, created various forms of literary and artistic performances and gone to the streets to propagate and perform.

The proletarian revolutionaries, who are the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, are staunch supporters of the Peking Opera revolution and resolute opponents of the revisionist line in literature and art. Many revolutionary workers pointed out in the symposium on Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine that the publication of these two important articles on the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has special significance. It has greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries, crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and dealt a fatal blow to the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles under his protection. The proletarian revolutionaries of the Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory, the Second Machine Tool Factory, and the Second Radio Factory said in the symposium: Jiang Qing's speech is very important; it speaks the words in the hearts of tens of millions of workers and peasants. We workers and peasants love plays that portray the heroic images of workers and peasants; such plays, we can never get enough of. Workers who have seen the model Peking Operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Red Lantern" said that when we watch these plays, our thoughts and emotions completely fuse with the heroic characters on the stage. But the stories of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties are completely alien to us workers. Revolutionary Peking Opera embodies the revolutionary spirit and determination of us workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry the revolution through to the end. It makes us spiritually invigorated and brave to move forward. We must enthusiastically hail the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution!

Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine have caused a great resonance among the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary teachers and students in universities and colleges such as Fudan University, Tongji University, and Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School. The small fighters of the "East Is Red" Combat Team of the "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Squad" of Tongji University, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, immediately created and rehearsed performances such as the dialogue "Shouting for the Peking Opera Revolution" and the song "Long Live the Victory of Mao Zedong's Line in Literature and Art" based on the spirit of Jiang Qing's speech, and went to the streets to propagate and perform. They said: The stage of New China is a stage for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, a stage for workers, peasants, and soldiers, a revolutionary stage, a socialist stage, and definitely not a stage for emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, feudalism, and capitalism. We must stand together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and artistic workers, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's line in literature and art, and let the great images of workers, peasants, and soldiers stand tall on the cultural and artistic stage!

Many revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Shanghai unanimously believe that under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution achieved in the struggle between the two lines has profound significance for the cultural revolution in China and the world, and has written a brilliant page in the history of Chinese and world culture. In the past, Shanghai, which was long occupied by the reactionary revisionist line in literature and art headed by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, was able to create excellent model Peking Operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Port" because Jiang Qing and Comrade Ke Qingshi firmly implemented Chairman Mao's guiding principles for the Peking Opera revolution, closely followed Chairman Mao's thoughts, and relied on the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary literary and artistic workers to continuously struggle against the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party. Some young revolutionary Peking Opera workers of the Shanghai Peking Opera House pointed out in the symposium that the reason why the handful of capitalist-roaders in authority within the Shanghai Peking Opera House fiercely attacked and obstructed the creation of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Port" and maliciously slandered and attacked these two model operas is ultimately because they have the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party as their supporter behind them. However, under the personal guidance of Jiang Qing, the revolutionary Peking Opera workers have waged a sharp struggle against these bad elements and finally achieved victory. This shows that Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful and invincible weapon for the success of the Peking Opera revolution.

Some revolutionary drama workers pointed out in the symposium that they deeply felt that the two figures emphasized in Jiang Qing's speech "On the Revolution of Peking Opera" are indeed very shocking. These two figures raise the fundamental questions of whether or not to make a revolution and whether or not to have socialism, and all literary and artistic workers should be seriously alert. They believe that Jiang Qing's important speech not only guided the Peking Opera revolution to achieve great victories but will also guide and inspire all revolutionary literary and artistic workers to be full of confidence and unwaveringly, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, attack a series of old strongholds, and flourish the new art of the proletarian revolution.

To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the revolutionary musicians and dancers in Shanghai, who are rehearsing the large-scale song and dance "January Storm" and "Long Live the Red Guards," have been greatly inspired by Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine. They declared that they would resolutely overcome all difficulties, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and seriously rehearse the two large-scale revolutionary song and dances that reflect the immortal achievements of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and definitely, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, create more modern revolutionary plays to serve proletarian politics and serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

According to the New China News Agency, in the midst of the triumphant songs of the billion-strong cultural revolution army, which is holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism and launching a fierce total attack on the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, at the moment of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the publication of Jiang Qing's speech "On the Revolution of Peking Opera" at the symposium of the Peking Opera modern drama observation and performance personnel in July 1964 and the editorial "Hail the Great Victory of the Peking Opera Revolution" in the Red Flag magazine have brought great inspiration and strength to the soldiers and cultural workers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing and Shanghai. They enthusiastically hail the victory of the Peking Opera revolution as a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They declare that they will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on every front.

The broad soldiers and cultural workers of the troops stationed in Beijing and Shanghai enthusiastically praised Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine, saying that every word and sentence shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, every word and sentence speaks to the hearts of us proletarian revolutionary fighters, and every word and sentence strikes at the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, the biggest obstacle to the Peking Opera revolution; it gives a great boost to the seven hundred million revolutionary people who are vigorously criticizing the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, and deals another heavy blow to the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, the supreme backer of the revisionist line in literature and art, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

After studying Jiang Qing's speech, the broad soldiers and cultural workers of the troops stationed in Beijing and Shanghai unanimously believe that Jiang Qing's speech is a model of studying and applying Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, a brilliant summary of implementing Chairman Mao's line in literature and art, an important document using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to solve the problems of the Peking Opera revolution, and an important weapon guiding us to occupy all stages and all fronts with Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to learn from Jiang Qing, learn from her holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, learning from her unlimited love, resolute implementation, and courageous defense of Mao Zedong Thought. We will definitely thoroughly criticize the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party, letting the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought occupy all fronts.

In the center of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing, the soldiers of the troops stationed in Beijing and the revolutionary cultural workers of the General Political Department Cultural Troupe of the People's Liberation Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Railway Corps Political Department enthusiastically, with revolutionary passion, listened to the broadcast again and again, held symposiums, and seriously studied Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine. The more they studied, the deeper their understanding of the great significance of the Peking Opera revolution, the more they loved Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the more they hated the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. They said that the Peking Opera revolution is not just a matter of Peking Opera; it is a serious class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat over seizing and counter-seizing power, over restoration and counter-restoration. If the Peking Opera stage is in the hands of the bourgeoisie, it will undermine and destroy our socialist economic base and proletarian dictatorship, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the personal guidance of Jiang Qing, the proletarian revolutionaries have seized back this front, which is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great joy for the proletariat and the broad laboring people. Revolutionary modern Peking Opera is good; we workers, peasants, and soldiers firmly support and support it. Whoever dares to oppose the Peking Opera revolution is our enemy, and we will resolutely overthrow it. The revolutionary cultural workers of the Political Department Cultural Troupe of the Navy said that in the past, under the control of the revisionist line in literature and art, the Peking Opera stage was always dominated by the decadent and corrupt things of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, corrupting people's souls. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art and the personal guidance of Jiang Qing, after a hard struggle, we have finally taken down this most stubborn stronghold in the art of drama, which is a great merit for the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world. Our troupe has always had the struggle between the two classes and the two lines in every creation and performance of our plays. However, we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, so we can achieve victory. We must thoroughly criticize the influence of the revisionist line in literature and art on us, let Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought take root in our minds, and forever advance in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

The broad soldiers and cultural workers of the troops stationed in Shanghai, with revolutionary passion, listened to and immediately seriously studied Jiang Qing's important speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine. They enthusiastically hail the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. They resolutely declare that they will remember Chairman Mao's teachings, use the revolutionary gun to defend the proletarian dictatorship, use the revolutionary pen to defend the iron-clad socialist mountains that will never change color, seize back all the cultural and artistic powers that have been occupied by the handful of capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party and the reactionary "authorities" in the academic circles, let the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine over the cultural and artistic front, and let the stage of New China forever stand the revolutionary heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers! The fighters of the "Eight Heroes of Nanjing Road" said in the symposium that we workers and peasants have always been the creators of history, but due to the control of the revisionist line in literature and art, the stage of Peking Opera in New China was once dominated by the dead, the ancient, and the foreigners, and the heroic images of workers and peasants could not be expressed. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and the guidance of Jiang Qing, and the efforts of the broad revolutionary comrades in the Peking Opera circles, revolutionary Peking Opera has finally broken through the heavy obstacles of the revisionist line in literature and art and emerged, and has created and performed a batch of excellent model operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Port," "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and "The Attack on the White Tiger Regiment" that we workers and peasants love. This great situation has greatly boosted the morale of us workers and peasants and crushed the arrogance of the capitalist-roader in authority within the Party and various reactionary "authorities" in the academic circles. We shout from the bottom of our hearts: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" "Long live the great victory of the Peking Opera revolution!" The revolutionary cultural workers of the Cultural Troupe of a certain unit of the East China Fleet, after seriously studying Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial in the Red Flag magazine, unanimously excitedly declared that they would hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, take root among the masses, and create and perform literary and artistic operas that truly portray the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    北京市革命委员会常委、北京市贫下中农代表会议常委罗瑞华说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持下，一贯地利用戏剧舞台颠倒历史，美化剥削阶级，鼓吹阶级调和，麻痹革命人民的斗志，阻止革命人民起来造他们的反，好让他们安安稳稳地做复辟资本主义的美梦。这是绝对办不到的！在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下取得的京剧革命的伟大胜利，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，大大鼓舞着我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，完成斗批改的伟大历史任务。

    正在为毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年举行纪念活动，赶排革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的工农兵芭蕾舞剧团演员们说，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，我们终于把《红色娘子军》排演成功，迈出了芭蕾舞剧革命化的坚实的第一步。今后，我们一定要进一步学好毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇光辉的著作，学好江青同志《谈京剧革命》这篇重要讲话，做到洋为中用，使芭蕾舞剧成为保卫社会主义经济基础的艺术，为亿万工农兵服务。
    新华社上海十日电　在举国欢庆我们伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的日子里，江青同志《谈京剧革命》的重要讲话和《红旗》杂志社论《欢呼京剧革命的伟大胜利》的发表，给上海的无产阶级革命派和革命的文艺工作者带来了极其巨大的鼓舞。他们最热烈地欢呼在伟大的毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，广大工农兵群众和革命的文艺工作者从党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和反动的学术“权威”的手里，夺回了文化艺术大权，夺回了京剧舞台的大权；最热烈地欢呼京剧这一古老的传统剧种以崭新的革命面貌出现在无产阶级的百花园里，正以不可估量的伟大影响使整个社会主义文艺朝气蓬勃地向前发展。他们信心百倍地表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，举起革命的批判大旗，以更加高昂的革命战斗姿态，投入当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，把修正主义文艺黑线彻底打垮砸烂，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派彻底批倒斗臭，让毛泽东思想的光辉永远照耀整个文化艺术阵地！让新中国的舞台上永远矗立着当代的工农兵革命英雄形象！
    今天，上海的许多工厂、人民公社、部队、学校和文艺团体，结合文艺战线上两条路线的剧烈斗争，纷纷举行座谈会，讨论和学习江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志的社论。正参加上海市工农兵文艺会演的几百个毛泽东思想宣传小分队，根据这两个重要文件的精神编成了多种文艺形式的战斗节目，走上街头宣传演出。
    无产阶级文化大革命的强大主力军——上海的革命工人，是京剧革命的坚决支持者，是反革命修正主义文艺路线的坚决反对者。许多革命工人今天在座谈江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志的社论时指出：这两篇重要文章在伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候发表，有着特殊重要的意义。它大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和在他包庇下的文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子是一个致命的打击。上海电焊机厂、上海第二机床厂和上海无线电二厂无产阶级革命派，在座谈会上说：江青同志的讲话非常重要，说出了我们千千万万工农兵心里的话。我们工农兵最喜欢表现工农兵英雄形象的戏，这种戏，我们就是百看不厌。看过《智取威虎山》、《红灯记》等京剧样板戏的工人说，我们看这些戏时，思想感情完全和舞台上的英雄人物交融在一起。而帝王将相、才子佳人那一套，同我们工人就是格格不入。革命京剧体现了我们工农兵革命英雄气概和将革命进行到底的决心，它使我们精神焕发，奋勇向前。就是要为京剧革命的伟大胜利而热烈欢呼！
    江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志社论在复旦大学、同济大学、上海市第六女子中学等大专院校和中等学校的红卫兵小将以及广大革命师生中引起了巨大反响。同济大学“东方红”战斗兵团的“毛泽东思想宣传小分队”的小将们，怀着对毛主席的革命路线无限忠诚的激情，根据江青同志讲话的精神，立即创作和排练了对口词《为京剧革命大喊大叫》、歌唱《毛泽东文艺路线胜利万岁》等节目，走上街头向工农兵群众宣传演出。他们说：新中国的舞台是宣传毛泽东思想的舞台，是工农兵的舞台，是革命的舞台，是社会主义的舞台，决不是帝王将相、才子佳人、封建主义、资本主义的舞台。我们一定要同广大工农兵群众和革命的文艺工作者站在一起，在毛泽东文艺路线的光辉照耀下，把工农兵的高大形象矗立在文化艺术舞台上！
    上海很多革命的文艺工作者一致认为，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在两条路线斗争中取得的京剧革命的伟大胜利，对全中国和全世界的文化革命具有深远的意义，它在中国和世界的文化史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页。过去作为周扬、夏衍等文艺界反革命修正主义路线总头目长期盘踞的重要阵地上海，所以能创作出《智取威虎山》《海港》等优秀的京剧样板戏，这是江青同志和柯庆施同志坚决贯彻毛主席的京剧革命的指导方针的结果，是他们紧跟毛主席思想，依靠工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派不断斗争的结果。上海京剧院一些年青的革命京剧工作者在座谈中指出，上海京剧院党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所以极力攻击阻挠《智取威虎山》和《海港》的创作，对这两个样板戏进行种种污蔑和攻击，归根结底是因为在他们背后有党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在支持他们。但是，在江青同志亲自指导下，革命的京剧工作者同这些坏家伙进行了尖锐的斗争，终于取得了胜利。这说明毛泽东思想是京剧革命成功的无坚不摧的最强大的战斗武器。
    一些革命的戏剧工作者在座谈中特别深切地感到，江青同志在《谈京剧革命》这篇讲话中着重阐明的两个数字确实是十分惊心动魄的。这两个数字提出了要不要革命，要不要社会主义的大是大非问题，值得所有文艺工作者严重警惕。他们认为，江青同志的这篇重要讲话不但指导京剧革命取得了伟大胜利，它还将指导和鼓舞一切革命文艺工作者信心百倍，坚定不移地在毛泽东思想指引下，去彻底斗倒党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，去攻破一系列的旧堡垒，去繁荣无产阶级的革命的新艺术。
    为了欢庆毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，正在排练大型歌舞《一月风暴》和《英雄的红卫兵万岁》的上海革命的音乐舞蹈工作者，从江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志社论中得到了极大的鼓舞。他们表示，一定要下定决心，排除万难，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，拜工农兵群众为师，认真排演好这两个反映上海无产阶级革命派在无产阶级文化大革命中建立不朽功勋的革命大型歌舞，一定要在伟大的毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，创作出更多的现代革命戏，为无产阶级政治服务，为广大工农兵群众服务。
    据新华社十日讯　在亿万文化革命大军高举革命的批判大旗，向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发动猛烈总攻击的凯歌声中，在欢庆毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时刻，江青同志一九六四年七月在京剧现代戏观摩演出人员的座谈会上的讲话《谈京剧革命》和《红旗》杂志社论《欢呼京剧革命的伟大胜利》的发表，给人民解放军驻京部队和驻沪部队陆海空三军指战员以及部队文艺工作者以极大的鼓舞和力量。他们热情洋溢地欢呼京剧革命的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大胜利。他们表示决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地。
    驻京、驻沪部队广大指战员和部队文艺工作者热烈赞扬江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志的社论，字字句句闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉，字字句句说到了我们无产阶级革命战士的心坎上，字字句句击中了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这个京剧革命的最大的拦路虎；给正在大造党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反的七亿革命人民以巨大的鼓舞，给党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这个反革命修正主义文艺路线的总后台又一沉重的打击，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    驻京、驻沪部队广大指战员和部队文艺工作者学习了江青同志的讲话以后，一致认为，江青同志的讲话，是活学活用毛主席文艺思想的典范，是贯彻毛主席文艺路线的一个光辉的实践总结，是运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想解决京剧革命问题的一个重要文件，是指导我们用毛泽东思想占领一切舞台、占领一切阵地的一个重要武器。我们决心向江青同志学习，学习她高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、活学活用毛主席著作，学习她无限热爱、坚决贯彻、努力宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想。我们一定坚决、彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的中心北京，驻京部队指战员和中国人民解放军总政治部文工团、海军、空军、铁道兵政治部文工团的革命文艺工作者，满怀革命激情，一遍又一遍地收听广播，纷纷举行座谈会，认真学习江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志的社论，越学对京剧革命伟大意义的认识越深刻，对毛主席的革命路线越热爱，对资产阶级反动路线越痛恨。他们说，京剧革命，绝不仅仅是一个京剧的问题，这是资产阶级与无产阶级夺权和反夺权、复辟和反复辟的严重的阶级斗争。京剧这个阵地掌握在资产阶级手里，就会瓦解和破坏我们的社会主义经济基础和无产阶级专政，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的亲自指导下，无产阶级革命派夺回了这个阵地，这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是无产阶级和广大劳动人民的大喜事。革命的现代京剧就是好，我们工农兵坚决拥护，坚决支持。谁敢反对京剧革命，谁就是我们工农兵的敌人，坚决把它打倒。海军政治部文工团的革命文艺工作者说，过去，京剧舞台在反革命修正主义文艺路线的控制下，一直以帝王将相、才子佳人那一套腐朽没落的东西，腐蚀人们的灵魂。在毛主席革命的文艺路线的指引下，在江青同志亲自指导下，经过艰苦的斗争，终于把这个戏剧艺术中最顽固的堡垒攻下来了，这真是为全国人民和全世界革命人民立下了不朽的功勋。我们团过去在创作和排演的每一台戏剧中，也贯串着两个阶级、两条路线的斗争。但是，我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就能取得胜利。我们一定要彻底批判修正主义文艺路线对我们的影响，让毛主席的文艺思想在我们的头脑里扎根，永远沿着毛主席指引的方向前进。
    驻沪部队广大指战员和部队文艺工作者，怀着革命激情，收听并立即认真学习了江青同志的重要讲话和《红旗》杂志社论。他们热烈欢呼在伟大的毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，京剧革命取得的伟大胜利。他们坚决地表示，一定牢记毛主席的教导，用革命的枪杆子保卫无产阶级政权，用革命的笔杆子捍卫社会主义的铁打江山永不变色，把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和反动学术“权威”霸占的一切文化艺术大权统统夺回来，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远照耀着文化艺术阵地，让新中国的舞台永远矗立着工农兵的革命英雄形象！“南京路上好八连”指战员在座谈中说，我们工农兵从来就是创造历史的主人，但是，由于修正主义文艺路线的控制，新中国的京剧舞台上过去却让死人、古人、洋人统治着，工农兵的英雄形象却得不到表现。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的指导下，在京剧界广大革命同志的努力下，革命的京剧终于冲破了反革命修正主义文艺路线的重重阻力，杀了出来，并且创作演出了为我们工农兵喜爱的《智取威虎山》《海港》《红灯记》《沙家浜》《奇袭白虎团》等一批优秀样板戏。这一大好形势大长了我们工农兵的志气，大灭了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和形形色色反动学术“权威”的威风。我们从心底里高呼：“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“京剧革命的伟大胜利万岁！”东海舰队某部文工团的革命文艺工作者在认真学习了江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志社论后，一致激动地表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决按照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》办事，为工农兵服务，扎根群众之中，创作和演出真正表现工农兵英雄形象的文艺戏曲。
