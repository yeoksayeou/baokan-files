The British authorities in Hong Kong's bloody suppression of Chinese workers and residents has sparked outrage and protests from revolutionary peoples around the world, including the British people. In recent days, revolutionary organizations and progressive peoples from various countries have issued statements or written letters strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for their fascist atrocities against Chinese workers and residents, and resolutely supporting the just struggle of Chinese patriots against oppression.

The General Federation of Trade Unions of Vietnam wrote a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on May 18, expressing full support for the just struggle of Chinese workers in Hong Kong. The letter pointed out that the British authorities' fascist crimes in suppressing Chinese workers show that they are closely colluding with American imperialists to oppose China. This brutal act is related to the British authorities allowing the United States to use Hong Kong as a rear base for the war of aggression against Vietnam. The letter expressed full support for the statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on May 15 and the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 17.

The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's External Liaison Committee issued a statement on May 18 pointing out that the British government and the Hong Kong authorities' fascist suppression of Chinese workers and residents is part of the plot led by American imperialism to oppose the People's Republic of China, and is closely related to the British government's policy of following the United States in its war of aggression against Vietnam. The statement expressed full support for the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China on May 15, and demanded that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately implement the demands proposed by the Chinese government in the aforementioned statement.

The spokesperson for the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on May 19 pointing out that the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong are "obviously part of the common plot of the British government colluding with American imperialism to oppose the People's Republic of China and expand the war of aggression in Indochina." The statement said that the people of Laos fully support the position stated by the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of China in its May 15 statement, and demand that the British authorities immediately stop all fascist actions against Chinese workers and residents in Hong Kong, and stop colluding with American imperialism to oppose China and the countries of Indochina in all plots and actions.

An article published in the Malay newspaper "The Frontline" in Singapore on May 21 pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong's bloody suppression and cruel persecution of Chinese residents is part of the anti-China chorus jointly planned by the United States and the Soviet revisionists. The article emphasized that the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao Zedong, has long pointed out: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries towards the people's cause, and they will never deviate from this logic." American imperialism is a paper tiger, Soviet revisionism is a paper tiger, and British imperialism is also a paper tiger. A bunch of paper tigers together are still paper tigers. If the British imperialist paper tiger wants to test the strength of the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, it will end up in a shameful defeat!

An article published in the Australian "Vanguard" newspaper on May 25 pointed out: "American imperialism has long used Hong Kong as a base for its war against the Vietnamese people. The People's Republic of China has repeatedly warned the British government: the Chinese government will not allow this." The article emphasized that the Australian working people support the struggle of the Chinese people in Hong Kong against the fascist atrocities of British imperialism.

Dave Wolpe, secretary of the "Friends of China" organization, issued a statement on behalf of the organization on May 25, pointing out that the thousands of members of "Friends of China" stand in solidarity with the Chinese workers and students in Hong Kong, fully supporting their just struggle. The statement said that the British imperialists who are madly suppressing the Chinese residents in Hong Kong are the same people who are launching vicious attacks on the British working people at home, creating unemployment, freezing wages, and lowering living standards. It is these British imperialists who support American imperialism's bloody massacre of the heroic Vietnamese people.

The Coventry Workers' Association in the UK issued a statement on May 21, expressing support for "the firm and correct just position taken by the People's Republic of China under the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong." The statement demanded that the British government "fully accept China's just demands." The statement said: "The Chinese workers and Chinese residents in Hong Kong are fighting against the same class enemy that is also the class enemy of the British proletariat."

    各国革命人民怒斥英帝暴行  坚决支持港九同胞正义斗争
    本报综合报道：据新华社讯，香港英国当局血腥镇压中国工人和居民的法西斯暴行，引起各国革命人民，包括英国人民的愤怒抗议。连日来，各国革命组织和进步人民纷纷发表声明或以写信方式强烈谴责港英当局血腥镇压中国工人和居民的滔天罪行，并坚决支持中国爱国同胞反迫害的正义斗争。
    越南总工会十八日写信给中华全国总工会，表示完全支持香港中国工人的正义斗争。信件指出，英国当局镇压中国工人的法西斯罪行表明，他们同美帝国主义者紧密勾结来反对中国。这一残暴行为同英国当局允许美国把香港作为侵越战争的后方基地有关。信中表示完全支持中国外交部五月十五日的声明和越南民主共和国外交部五月十七日的声明。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会对外联络委员会十八日发表声明指出，英国政府和香港当局对中国工人和居民的法西斯镇压，是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义反对中华人民共和国的阴谋的组成部分，并同英国政府追随美国侵略越南的战争政策有着密切的关系。声明表示完全支持中华人民共和国外交部五月十五日的声明，坚决要求英国政府和香港英国当局立即实现中国政府在上述声明中提出的要求。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十九日发表声明指出，香港英国当局的法西斯暴行，“显然是英国政府勾结美帝国主义，反对中华人民共和国和扩大对印度支那的侵略战争的共同阴谋的一个组成部分”。声明说，老挝人民全力支持中华人民共和国外交部在五月十五日的声明中所阐明的立场，并且要求英国当局立即停止它对香港中国工人和居民所采取的一切法西斯行动，停止勾结美帝国主义，反对中国和印度支那各国的一切阴谋和行动。
    在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》二十一日发表文章指出，香港英国当局对中国居民所进行的血腥镇压和残酷迫害，同印尼反动派大肆反华排华，都是美帝与苏修共同策划的反华大合唱的一个组成部分。文章强调，中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席早就指出：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义是纸老虎，苏联修正主义是纸老虎，英帝国主义也是纸老虎，纸老虎加在一起也还是纸老虎。英帝国主义这只破烂不堪的纸老虎，如果想试一试用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民的力量的话，到头来只会落得个一败涂地的可耻下场！
    澳大利亚《先锋报》二十五日发表文章指出：“美帝国主义一直利用香港作为它反对越南人民的战争基地。中华人民共和国已经多次警告英国政府：中华人民共和国政府决不容许这样作。文章强调说，澳大利亚劳动人民支持香港的中国人民反对英帝国主义的法西斯暴行的斗争。
    英国的“中国之友”书记戴夫·沃尔佩二十五日代表这个组织发表声明指出，“中国之友”的数千会员同香港的中国工人和学生团结得象一个人一样，全力支持他们的正义斗争。声明说，疯狂镇压香港中国居民的英帝国主义者，也就是在英国国内对英国劳动人民发动恶毒进攻，制造失业，冻结工资、压低生活水平的那一伙人。正是这一伙英帝国主义者，支持美帝国主义对英勇的越南人民进行血腥的屠杀。
    英国考文垂工人协会二十一日发表声明，表示支持“在中国伟大的革命领袖毛泽东主席领导下的中华人民共和国所采取的坚定的、正确的正义立场”。声明要求英国政府“完全接受中国的正义要求”。声明说：香港的中国工人和中国居民“正在与之斗争的阶级敌人也是英国无产阶级的阶级敌人”。
