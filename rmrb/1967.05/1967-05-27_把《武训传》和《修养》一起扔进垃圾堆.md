The nationwide billion-strong military and civilian populace enthusiastically acclaims the re-publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'"
Throw "The Life of Wu Xun" and "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation" into the garbage dump together
The broad revolutionary masses declare: Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the reactionary "Wu Xun spirit" and the slave philosophy, capitulation philosophy, and traitor philosophy advocated by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, resolutely turn literature and art into a powerful weapon for defending the dictatorship of the proletariat

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated May 26, our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant historical document guiding the cultural revolution—"On the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'"—has been re-published, bringing immense encouragement and boundless fighting strength to the nationwide billion-strong workers, peasants, and soldiers who are enthusiastically celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres from all over the country unanimously point out: The film "The Life of Wu Xun" and "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation" are the same in essence and core—they both oppose proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Today, as we re-study Chairman Mao's brilliant directives on criticizing the film "The Life of Wu Xun," we must always remember class struggle and always remember to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, from the ideological, political, and theoretical standpoints, thoroughly criticize the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who support and praise this reactionary film and their mastermind—the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. We must smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

The revolutionary masses of the capital, after re-studying Chairman Mao's great directive "On the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," have drawn boundless strength from it. Many workers, peasants, and soldiers have written to newspapers, determined to thoroughly criticize and expose the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's "On the Practice of Self-Cultivation," and to thoroughly bury the reactionary "Wu Xun spirit" for the defense of the dictatorship of the proletariat! Gao Shulan and Wang Yupei of Nanhuqu Dazui Brigade, Changyang District, Beijing, wrote in their article: The stinking film "The Life of Wu Xun" is poisoned wine and opium. The former Propaganda Department, former Cultural Department, former Beijing Municipal Committee, and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, along with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party who supports them from behind, regard Wu Xun as a jewel in the palm of their hand, erecting monuments and biographies for him, and even absurdly giving him the title of "serving the people." We workers and peasants will never allow these bad guys to defile these five golden words that shine brightly!

The article by the Red Rebel Art Squad of Beijing Gear Factory Workers' Congress wrote: The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism, wants to make the Chinese people into "docile tools" for imperialism and the landlord bourgeoisie. This is precisely the purpose of his advocacy of the reactionary "Wu Xun spirit." We revolutionary people have boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great teaching of "rebellion is justified." We must rebel until we thoroughly eliminate all the dregs and remnants of capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism from the stage of history, so that the proletarian state, for which our countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives and shed their blood, will never change color!

The revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of Shanghai Red Flag Film Studio held a meeting to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and thoroughly criticize the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun." A comrade who spoke at the meeting pointed out that a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles once released this reactionary film advocating slavery and promoting class capitulationism, praising a slave of the landlord class as the "great savior" of the nation's peasants. Their purpose was to use the reactionary "Wu Xun spirit" to numb the revolutionary will of the broad masses of the people and prepare public opinion for their counter-revolutionary restoration plot. Everyone expressed that in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, we must not only thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line promoted by Zhou Yang, Xianyan, and the like, but also definitely criticize and expose their mastermind, and firmly grasp the power of literature and art in the hands of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, so that films and various forms of literature and art become powerful weapons for defending the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary cadres of Shanxi Province pointed out that at this crucial moment of life-and-death struggle between the two classes and the two lines, the re-publication of this great historical document by Chairman Mao is another great encouragement to the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and another heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. A young revolutionary of Shanxi Provincial Institute of Education said: The number one capitalist-roader in the Party vigorously advocates the philosophy of survival, traitor philosophy, and slavery, praising Wu Xun. His purpose is to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. We Red Guards will definitely keep our eyes open, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and knock down the Chinese Khrushchev, making him never able to stand up again.

After re-studying Chairman Mao's great teachings, the revolutionary masses of Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, and many other places have come to a deeper understanding that the struggle surrounding "The Life of Wu Xun" reflects the fierce struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for power in the socialist period, and the struggle between restoration and anti-restoration. They pointed out that in the past 17 years since the founding of the nation, the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles have always used literature and art as an important tool for their restoration of capitalism. In the cultural revolution, we must thoroughly smash their evil plots and truly turn literature and art into powerful weapons for defending the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The broad cadres and cultural workers of the army, navy, and air force, who are deeply studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," today seriously studied Chairman Mao's great directive "On the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'." The representative of the advanced collective studying Mao's works, the Red First Company of a certain unit, said: Today, as we re-study Chairman Mao's great teachings, we must better study and apply Mao's works, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, and smash the big poisonous weeds like "The Life of Wu Xun" to smithereens, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine over all of China and the world!

    全国亿万军民热烈欢呼毛主席《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》重新发表
    把《武训传》和《修养》一起扔进垃圾堆
    广大革命群众表示：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判反动的“武训精神”和党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的奴才哲学、投降哲学和叛徒哲学，决心使文艺成为捍卫无产阶级专政的强大武器
    据新华社二十六日讯　我们伟大领袖毛主席指导文化革命的又一光辉历史文献——《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的重新发表，给正在热烈欢庆《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的全国亿万工农兵群众，带来了极大的鼓舞和无穷的战斗力量。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众一致指出：电影《武训传》和《修养》一样，它的实质和要害都是反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。我们今天重温毛主席对批判电影《武训传》的英明指示，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘巩固无产阶级专政，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从思想上、政治上、理论上把支持和吹捧这部反动影片的一小撮反革命修正主义分子及其总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭、批深、批透，彻底砸烂反革命修正主义文艺黑线，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    首都广大无产阶级革命派，重新学习了毛主席的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》这一伟大指示，从中汲取了无穷的力量。许多工农兵纷纷给报纸写文章，决心把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》批倒批臭，彻底埋葬反动的“武训精神”，为保卫无产阶级专政而战！北京市朝阳区来广营公社南湖渠大队的高淑兰、王玉佩在文章中说，《武训传》这个臭影片，是毒药酒，是鸦片烟。旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，以及背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，却把武训看成掌上明珠，为他树碑立传，还异想天开地给他加上“为人民服务”的称号。我们工农兵绝不允许这些坏家伙污蔑为人民服务这五个金光闪闪的大字！工代会北京齿轮厂红色造反文艺战斗队的文章写道：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为了达到他复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，妄想让中国人民做帝国主义和地主资产阶级的“驯服工具”，这也就是他鼓吹反动的“武训精神”的目的。我们革命人民无限信仰毛泽东思想，坚决实行毛主席的“造反有理”的伟大教导。我们就是要造反，直到把一切资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的残渣余孽彻底清除出历史舞台，让我们千千万万革命先烈用生命和鲜血换来的无产阶级江山永不变色！
    上海红旗电影制片厂的革命派和革命群众，举行了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗彻底批判反动影片《武训传》的大会。在会上发言的同志指出，文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子当年抛出这部宣扬奴隶主义，鼓吹阶级投降主义的反动电影《武训传》，把一个地主阶级的奴才吹捧成为全国农民的“大救星”，其目的就是妄图以反动的“武训精神”来麻痹广大人民的革命意志，为他们的反革命复辟阴谋作舆论准备。大家表示，在当前这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，不但要把周扬、夏衍之流推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线彻底砸烂，而且一定要把他们的总后台批倒批臭，把文艺大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，让电影等各种文艺都成为捍卫无产阶级专政的强大武器。
    山西省广大无产阶级革命派指出，在两个阶级、两条路线生死决战的关键时刻，毛主席这一伟大历史文献的重新发表对无产阶级革命派是又一个巨大的鼓舞，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是又一个沉重的打击。山西省教育学院的革命小将说，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竭力宣扬活命哲学、叛徒哲学和奴隶主义，吹捧武训，其目的就是为了要颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。我们红卫兵小将一定要擦亮眼睛，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，把中国的赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，叫他永世不得翻身。
    黑龙江、贵州、山东以及其他许多地方的广大革命群众，在重温了毛主席的伟大教导以后，都更加深刻地认识到，围绕着《武训传》展开的一场斗争，是社会主义时期资产阶级同无产阶级争夺政权的激烈斗争的反映，是复辟与反复辟斗争的反映。他们指出，建国十七年来，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一直利用文艺作为他们复辟资本主义的重要工具。在文化大革命中，我们一定要彻底粉碎他们的罪恶阴谋，把文艺真正变成捍卫无产阶级专政的强大武器。
    正在深入学习毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的陆海空三军广大指战员和部队文艺工作者，今天都认真地学习了毛主席的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》这一伟大指示。学习毛主席著作先进集体、某部红一连的代表说，今天我们重温毛主席的伟大教导，一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把《武训传》之类的大毒草彻底砸个稀巴烂，巩固无产阶级专政，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照全中国，普照全世界！
