		A Lifetime of Promoting Mao Zedong Thought
		Du Jinfang, Beijing Opera Troupe

		On the occasion of celebrating the 25th anniversary of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Comrade Jiang Qing delivered an important speech at the meeting of the modern Beijing opera troupe in July 1964.

		Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, led revolutionary literary and artistic workers in an unyielding struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, achieving great merits and making special contributions to our country's cultural revolution.

		The former Propaganda Department, the former Ministry of Culture, the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and their ultimate backer, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, stirred up a bewildering and bewitching wind in the literary and artistic circles. They fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, opposed the revolutionary reforms of using the past to serve the present, using foreign elements for Chinese purposes, and innovating the old, and advocated "excavating traditions" and "inheriting schools." What they called "excavating traditions" was to dig up the corpses of the representatives of the exploiting classes to propagate for them, allowing their ghosts to continue to dominate the people's ideological battlefield and poison the people's souls. What they called "inheriting schools" was to force our young literary and artistic warriors to kneel before the feet of reactionary artistic "authorities," inherit the legacy of bourgeois literature and art, and degenerate into successors of the bourgeoisie, so that the decaying and declining reactionary culture would have successors.

		Comrade Jiang Qing said: "Nowadays, the stage is full of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, which is a set of feudalism and a set of bourgeoisie. This situation will not protect our economic base but will have a destructive effect on our economic base." She is absolutely right! The counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line's tricks are to use the superstructure of feudalism and capitalism to destroy our socialist economic base, undermine the foundations of socialism, and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

		"Eating the grain grown by peasants, wearing clothes woven by workers, living in houses built by workers, and having the People's Liberation Army guarding the front lines of national defense, but not portraying them." Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out this phenomenon of deviating from Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction, which is indeed worth every literary and artistic worker's deep reflection. In recent years, it is clear that the socialist stage is performing emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. Our audience is getting fewer and fewer, and many young people have protested against us. The workers, peasants, and soldiers want to spit on us. Just as we tried to perform some modern plays, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their "three old" black shops scolded us for "taking the wrong path," demanding us to perform "Landlord Opening the Granary" to praise landlords, the obscene "Dragon and Phoenix," and even proposed to perform "The Four Generals" to praise traitors. Where is Beijing opera going? At this critical moment, our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" and proposed to grasp the class struggle in the ideological realm. Comrade Jiang Qing resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, leading revolutionary literary and artistic warriors to hack through thorns and brambles, sweep away the evil atmosphere that had long shrouded the stage, and began the cultural revolution with dramatic reforms as the center.

		On November 1, 1963, Comrade Jiang Qing received us and gave us the script of the Shanghai opera "The Red Lantern." She kindly instructed us to study Chairman Mao's works seriously during the rehearsal of this play, to go deep into life, and to learn from the brother troupes that rehearsed revolutionary modern plays. At that time, our joyful and excited feelings were simply indescribable. We felt that Comrade Jiang Qing did not just give us a script of "The Red Lantern," but a red lantern to guide us forward in the mist.

		We will never forget Comrade Jiang Qing's hard work in rehearsing "The Red Lantern," from the structure of the script, the emotions of the characters, the music and singing, to the art design, all of which were infused with Comrade Jiang Qing's heart's blood. She, with an extremely responsible and extremely enthusiastic spirit, first focused on politics, to shape the towering heroic images of the three generations of Li Yuhe, often stayed up all night, sometimes when she was not feeling well, she still came to watch our rehearsal, and gave specific guidance in the arts. Comrade Jiang Qing, with her unyielding fighting spirit, overcame all kinds of obstacles, broke through all kinds of difficulties, promoted the righteousness of the proletariat, and eliminated the perverse winds of revisionism, setting a brilliant example for us.

		I will never forget that on New Year's Day 1965, Comrade Jiang Qing gave me a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Holding these four volumes of revolutionary truth, I couldn't help but feel my blood boiling and my excitement surging. From home to abroad, wherever we go, we can hear the cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao." How many audiences are eager to hear Chairman Mao's voice and see the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought from our performances. As an ordinary literary and artistic warrior taught by Chairman Mao, I gradually understood that my life should be a life of studying Mao Zedong Thought, a life of promoting Mao Zedong Thought. I solemnly vowed before Chairman Mao's portrait: I will listen to your words for the rest of my life, follow the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers as you have indicated, and always move forward.

### 一辈子做毛泽东思想的宣传员

    一辈子做毛泽东思想的宣传员
    中国京剧院　杜近芳
    在欢庆我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，江青同志一九六四年七月在京剧现代戏观摩演出人员的座谈会上的重要讲话发表了。
    我们敬爱的江青同志在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，领导革命的文艺工作者，同反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行了不屈不挠的斗争，建立了丰功伟绩，对我国的文化革命有着特殊的贡献。
    旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委以及他们的总后台党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在文艺界刮起了妖风迷雾。他们拚死抵制毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，反对戏剧的古为今用、洋为中用、推陈出新的革命改革，鼓吹“挖掘传统”、“继承流派”。他们所说的“挖掘传统”，就是要把那些剥削阶级代表人物的僵尸挖掘出来，为他们宣传，让他们的阴魂继续统治人民的思想阵地，毒害人民的灵魂；他们所说的“继承流派”，就是要迫使我们年青的文艺战士拜倒在反动艺术“权威”的脚下，继承资产阶级文艺的衣钵，堕落成资产阶级的接班人，好让腐朽没落的反动文化后继有人。
    江青同志说：“如今舞台上都是帝王将相、才子佳人，是封建主义的一套，是资产阶级的一套。这种情况，不能保护我们的经济基础，而会对我们的经济基础起破坏作用。”说得对极了！反革命修正主义文艺黑线搞的那一套，就是要用封建主义、资本主义的上层建筑，破坏我们社会主义的经济基础，挖社会主义的墙脚，为复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    “吃着农民种的粮食，穿着工人织造的衣服，住着工人盖的房子，人民解放军为我们警卫着国防前线，但是却不去表现他们”。江青同志指出的这种背离毛主席文艺方向的怪现象，确实值得每个文艺工作者深思。这些年来，分明是社会主义的舞台，却大演帝王将相、才子佳人。我们的观众越来越少了，许多青少年向我们提出了抗议，工农兵要唾弃我们了。我们刚刚想作一些演现代戏的尝试，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们开设的“三旧”黑店就呵斥我们“走错了路”，要我们上演赞扬地主开仓放粮的《打侄上坟》，黄色猥亵的《游龙戏凤》，甚至提出要演歌颂叛徒的《四郎探母》。京剧向何处去？在这个关键时刻，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召，提出了要抓意识形态领域里的阶级斗争。江青同志坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，率领革命文艺战士披荆斩棘，横扫笼罩着舞台的一片恶浊空气，开始了以戏剧改革为中心的文艺革命。
    一九六三年十一月的一天，江青同志接见了我们，交给我们沪剧《红灯记》剧本。她亲切地嘱咐我们，在排练这个剧的时候，要认真学习毛主席著作，要深入生活，要向排练革命现代戏的兄弟剧团学习。当时我们欢乐激动的心情，简直难以用言语表达。我们觉得，江青同志不只是给了我们一本《红灯记》剧本，而是给了一盏引导我们在迷雾中胜利前进的红灯。红灯照亮了我们的心，照亮了京剧革命的道路。
    我们永远忘不了江青同志在排演《红灯记》中付出的辛勤劳动，从剧本结构、人物感情、音乐唱腔到美术设计，都渗透了江青同志的心血。她以极端负责和极端热忱的精神，首先从政治着眼，为塑造李玉和祖孙三代的高大英雄形象，经常彻夜不眠，有时身体不好还去看我们排练，并且在艺术上给以具体指导。江青同志以不屈不挠的战斗精神，克服了种种阻力，冲破了重重困难，大树无产阶级的正气，大灭修正主义的歪风，为我们树立了光辉的典范。
    我永远不能忘记，在一九六五年元旦，江青同志送给我一套《毛泽东选集》。捧着这四卷革命真理的宝书，我不由得热血沸腾，激动万分。从国内到国外，我们走到哪里，都可以听到“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。多少观众都渴望从我们演出里听到毛主席的声音，看到毛泽东思想的光辉。作为毛主席教导的一个普通文艺战士，我逐渐懂得了我的一生，应该是学习毛泽东思想的一生，应该是宣传毛泽东思想的一生。我在毛主席像前庄严宣誓：我要一辈子听您的话，遵循您所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，永远前进。
