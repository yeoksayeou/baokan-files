For many years, the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has desperately opposed our country's path to socialism and has vigorously promoted capitalist goods. "Three Freedoms and One Contract" is one of his concocted products.

Chairman Mao said: "We Communists have never hidden our political program. Our future program or highest program is to advance China to a socialist society and a communist society. This is definite and beyond doubt." The socialist and communist path pointed out by Chairman Mao is our lofty ideal, and it is also the lofty ideal of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the whole world. To realize this great ideal, our beloved leader Chairman Mao has formulated a series of policies for us. In the countryside, it is to organize us to take the path of collectivization.

We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, deeply feel that Chairman Mao's words are all truths, and Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will go there. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, firmly and unshakably follow Chairman Mao's teachings and have organized ourselves. From mutual aid teams, primary cooperatives, advanced cooperatives, to people's communes. With the development of the collectivization cause, the face of the countryside has undergone fundamental changes, and our country is changing its "poor and blank" face. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. However, the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has been trying every means to sabotage the rural collective economy. He advocates developing the rich peasant economy, promotes hiring labor to exploit, and advocates "Three Freedoms and One Contract," etc., attempting to restore capitalism in China. We firmly do not agree.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road opposes socialism more, and we must walk the socialist path more firmly and walk it to the end, all the way to communism.

The experience of our Xigou Brigade fully proves that the collectivization path is the only correct path. From 1943 when the mutual aid team was established, to 1958 when the people's commune was established, the collective economy has gradually developed, and the collectivization path has become broader and broader. At present, grain yield per mu has increased from a few hundred catties before liberation to over six hundred catties, an increase of more than five times. The barren hills before liberation have now been completely greened. Before the establishment of the commune, the entire brigade had 130 large livestock and over 300 sheep. Now, there are over 230 large livestock and over 1,000 sheep. With the development and strengthening of the collective economy, the living standards of the broad masses of commune members are constantly improving. These great changes fully embody the greatness and correctness of the collectivization path and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

Our victory has aroused the hatred of the class enemy. The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road wants us to implement "Three Freedoms and One Contract," attempting to make us take the old capitalist road. We will not agree to this in a million ways. For many years, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses of our Xigou Brigade have firmly resisted this capitalist black wind. In 1953, we resisted the black wind of slashing cooperatives. In 1955, our cooperative in Xigou developed and strengthened further, and they hated it to the point of gnashing their teeth. They sent people to Xigou to force us to "dismount." We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigou, have decided to follow Chairman Mao. We angrily told them: "To dismount? No way! We will still gallop forward." Under the strong opposition of the masses, their "imperial envoy" saw that the situation was not good and slinked away with his tail between his legs. In 1961, they took advantage of our country's temporary economic difficulties to return, vigorously promoting "Three Freedoms and One Contract," and using every means to undermine the foundations of socialism. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses of Xigou Brigade, saw it with our own eyes and hated it in our hearts. We took up the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and fought resolutely against these bad elements, using the iron-clad facts of the development and strengthening of the socialist collective economy to repel their counterattacks.

To strike a snake, you must strike its head; to weed out grass, you must pull out its roots. The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is the root of this capitalist black wind. Today, his true colors have been exposed. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to stink, thoroughly eliminating the poison of "Three Freedoms and One Contract" he spread in the countryside, and better consolidate and strengthen the socialist economy.

    彻底肃清“三自一包”的流毒
    李顺达
    多年来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，拚命反对我国走社会主义道路，极力推销资本主义的黑货。“三自一包”就是他一手炮制的货色。
    毛主席说：“我们共产党人从来不隐瞒自己的政治主张。我们的将来纲领或最高纲领，是要将中国推进到社会主义社会和共产主义社会去的，这是确定的和毫无疑义的。”毛主席指引的社会主义和共产主义的道路，就是我们贫下中农的崇高理想，也是全国全世界革命人民的崇高理想。为了实现这个伟大的理想，我们敬爱的领袖毛主席为我们制定了一系列的方针政策。在农村就是要我们“组织起来”，走集体化的道路。
    我们广大贫下中农深深体会到：毛主席的话句句是真理，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。毛主席指向那里，我们就干到那里。我们广大贫下中农坚定不移地按照毛主席的教导，组织起来了。由互助组、初级社、高级社，一直到人民公社。随着集体化事业的发展，农村的面貌发生了根本的变化，我们的国家正在改变“一穷二白”的面貌。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。然而，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却千方百计地破坏农村集体经济。他鼓吹发展富农经济，提倡雇工剥削，主张“三自一包”等等，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，我们坚决不答应。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，越反对社会主义，我们越要走社会主义道路，坚决走到底，一直走到共产主义。
    我们西沟大队的经历充分说明：集体化道路是唯一正确的道路。西沟大队从一九四三年成立互助组，一九五八年成立人民公社到现在，集体经济逐步发展，集体化道路越走越宽广。目前，粮食亩产由解放前的百把斤，达到六百多斤，增长了五倍多。解放前的荒山秃岭，现在已经全部绿化。办社前，全大队有大牲口一百三十头，羊三百多只，现在圈存大牲口二百三十多头，羊一千多只。随着集体经济的发展和壮大，广大社员的生活日益提高。这些巨大的变化，充分体现了集体化道路的伟大、正确，体现了社会主义制度的无比优越。
    我们的胜利，引起了阶级敌人的憎恨。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，要我们搞“三自一包”，企图使我们走资本主义老路，我们一万个不答应。多年来，我们西沟大队的贫下中农和革命群众，对这股资本主义黑风，进行了坚决的抵制。一九五三年，我们顶住了大砍合作社的黑风。一九五五年，我们西沟的合作社，更加发展壮大了，他们恨得咬牙切齿，就派人来西沟，强迫我们“下马”。我们西沟的贫下中农是跟毛主席走定了。我们愤怒地告诉他们：“叫下马，不行！我们还要快马加鞭向前走。”在群众的强烈反对下，他们派来的“钦差大臣”见势不妙，夹着尾巴滚蛋了。一九六一年，他们又乘我国经济暂时困难时期卷土重来，大搞“三自一包”，千方百计地挖社会主义的墙脚。我们西沟大队的贫下中农和革命群众，看在眼里，恨在心里，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，同这些坏蛋进行了坚决的斗争，用社会主义集体经济发展壮大的铁的事实，打退了他们的反扑。
    打蛇要打头，锄草要锄根。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，就是这股资本主义黑风的总根子。今天，他的原形毕露了。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把他彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，彻底肃清他在农村散布的“三自一包”的流毒，更好地巩固和壮大社会主义经济。
