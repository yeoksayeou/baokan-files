Soldiers and officers from the People's Liberation Army in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and Shandong held rallies and parades to celebrate the first anniversary of the issuance of the "Notification," vowing to work with the broad revolutionary masses, using the "Notification" as a weapon, to carry out the revolutionary criticism movement thoroughly and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat to the end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated May 17, the issuance of the "Notification" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, brought great joy and encouragement to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and Shandong, who had created new immortal achievements in the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers unanimously hailed the great historical document personally directed by our great leader Chairman Mao as the beacon of the unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat and the lighthouse of the dictatorship of the proletariat shining with ten thousand rays of light. They hailed the great victories achieved in the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat under the guidance of this great historical document over the past year.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers, filled with the joy of victory in struggle, held celebration meetings and parades. At the symposium, they recited Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." They said proudly: We are the guards of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must defend the dictatorship of the proletariat with our blood and lives and carry the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat to the end!

The soldiers and officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in Beijing, the birthplace of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat in China, celebrated today as if it were the grandest festival, beating drums and gongs, holding various celebration activities, celebrating the first anniversary of the issuance of the "Notification," and celebrating the great victories of the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit wrote a poem full of the joy of victory: "The red sun rises over the land, the red flag flies over ten thousand miles of rivers and mountains. Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the great historical document, leading the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat from victory to victory." The soldiers and officers of a certain unit on duty in front of Tiananmen today joined tens of thousands of joyous teams to celebrate the issuance of the "Notification." They said: The "Notification" is our program for carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. The more we study this document, the clearer we understand: All class struggles are political struggles, and all revolutionary struggles are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. Five Good Soldier Xu Zhenghui said, on October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao personally raised the first five-star red flag on Tiananmen, proclaiming the birth of New China under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Recently, the establishment of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee proclaimed the downfall of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen. We are Chairman Mao's guard soldiers. We must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that our great socialist motherland will never change color.

The soldiers and officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai, who made special contributions in the great "January Revolution," studied the "Notification" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China today. The more they studied, the more they loved, believed in, and worshipped our great leader Chairman Mao. They wished our red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, ten thousand years of life! Ten thousand years of life! The soldiers and officers of a certain naval vessel, which Chairman Mao had personally visited fourteen years ago, sat around Chairman Mao's portrait, sat around the place where Chairman Mao had once received all the soldiers and officers of the vessel, and studied this great document seriously. They recited Chairman Mao's instructions in unison: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. They said: Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the proletariat must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. The most dangerous enemy of the proletariat is the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles. The greatest victory of this great Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat is to expose a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who attempted to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and to expose the biggest handful of power-holders within the party who took the capitalist road. This is a great victory related to the future, destiny, and future appearance of our party and country, and a great victory related to the future of the world revolution. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers fighting on various fronts in Shanghai, executing the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, unanimously expressed after studying the "Notification": We revolutionary soldiers are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must unite with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, fight together, study this document seriously, take this document as a guide, carry out the mass movement of revolutionary criticism thoroughly, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the Proletariat to the end.

When celebrating the issuance of the "Notification," many soldiers and officers stationed in Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong, who are fighting on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, also reviewed the experiences of the struggle over the past year with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They vowed to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and must use the "Notification" as a weapon of thought, create new achievements, and establish new merits.

    牢记毛主席教导紧握枪杆保卫无产阶级专政
    北京上海山西黑龙江贵州山东等地解放军指战员集会游行，欢呼《通知》发出一周年，决心和广大革命群众一起，以《通知》为思想武器，搞好革命大批判运动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    据新华社十七日讯　中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的发表，给在无产阶级文化大革命中创建了新的不朽功勋的人民解放军北京、上海、山西、黑龙江、贵州和山东驻军，带来极大的喜悦，极大的鼓舞。广大指战员齐声欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的这个伟大的历史文件，是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，是巩固无产阶级专政的光芒万丈的灯塔。欢呼一年来在这个伟大历史文件的指引下，无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利。
    满怀斗争胜利喜悦的广大指战员纷纷举行庆祝集会、游行。在座谈会上，他们一遍遍地朗诵毛主席语录：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”他们豪迈地说：我们是无产阶级专政的警卫兵，我们一定要用鲜血和生命保卫无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    驻守在我国无产阶级文化大革命策源地——北京的陆海空三军指战员，今天象过最盛大的节日一样，敲锣打鼓，举行各种庆祝活动，欢呼《通知》发出一周年，欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。某部指战员写了一首洋溢着胜利喜悦的诗：“红日东升照大地，万里江山飘红旗，毛主席亲自主持制定伟大的历史文件，将无产阶级文化大革命从胜利引向胜利。”在天安门前执勤的某部指战员们，今天和成千上万的报喜队一起欢呼《通知》的发表。他们说：《通知》是我们在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的纲领，越学这个文件，我们就越清楚地认识到：一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争，一切革命斗争都是为了夺取政权，巩固政权。五好战士徐政辉说，一九四九年十月一日，毛主席在天安门上亲手升起了第一面五星红旗，宣告了无产阶级专政的新中国的诞生。最近，北京市革命委员会的成立，宣告了以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的垮台。我们是毛主席的警卫战士，我们一定要念念不忘无产阶级专政，保证我们伟大的社会主义祖国永不变色。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中作出了特殊贡献的中国人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军指战员，今天，认真学习了中共中央的《通知》，越学习越无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜我们的伟大领袖毛主席。他们千万次祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！十四年前毛主席亲自登临过的海军某舰的指战员，围坐在毛主席像前，围坐在毛主席曾经接见过全舰指战员的地方，认真学习这个伟大的文件，齐声朗诵毛主席的教导：革命的根本问题是政权问题。他们说：在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，而资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。无产阶级最危险的敌人，就是混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物。这场轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的最大的胜利，就是揪出了一小撮妄想把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政的反革命修正主义分子，揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这是关系着我们党和国家的前途、命运和将来面貌的伟大胜利，关系到世界革命前途的伟大胜利。战斗在上海各条战线执行支左、支工、支农、军管和军训等光荣任务的广大指战员，学习了《通知》后一致表示：我们革命战士无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们一定与无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众、革命干部团结在一起，战斗在一起，认真学习这个文件，以这个文件为指南，搞好革命大批判的群众运动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在欢呼《通知》发表时，山西、贵州、黑龙江、山东等地驻军许多战斗在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训第一线的指战员，还和无产阶级革命派一起，回顾了一年来斗争的经验。他们决心遵循毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，一定要以《通知》为思想武器，创新功，立新劳。
