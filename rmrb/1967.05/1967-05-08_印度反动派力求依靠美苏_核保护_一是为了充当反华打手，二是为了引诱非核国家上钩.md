The imperialist United States, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, and the Indian reactionaries are hastening to implement the conspiracy of providing "nuclear protection" to non-nuclear weapon states by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Indian Foreign Minister Chagla recently returned to India after holding talks in Geneva with representatives of some countries participating in the disarmament conference. On April 27, he publicly declared that India must obtain "nuclear guarantees" from the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

In fact, the Indian government has long secretly accepted the so-called "air umbrella" (U.S. guarantee of air force assistance to the Indian government in times of war), forming a military alliance with the U.S. in the use of conventional weapons. Now, through the so-called "nuclear protection," the Indian government will also form a military alliance with the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the use of nuclear weapons, further colluding with them to jointly oppose China.

The activities of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and India are also preparations for the discussion on the treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons at the Geneva disarmament conference in May. In the process of drafting this treaty, the U.S. and Soviet revisionists have encountered some obstacles. Now, the Indian reactionaries are taking the lead in proposing the "nuclear protection" scheme to deceive non-nuclear weapon states into agreeing to sign this treaty. Chagla has publicly stated that the Indian government will try to make the treaty to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons acceptable to all non-nuclear weapon states. This is obviously to make other non-nuclear weapon states, like the Indian government, hand over their security to the two nuclear superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, to be controlled by them.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi recently sent one of her officials, Jha, to Moscow and Washington to actively promote this conspiracy. On April 19, Jha revealed at a press conference in Washington that after meeting with Soviet Premier Kosygin and Foreign Minister Gromyko, he learned that the Soviet authorities were willing to provide "written guarantees" to non-nuclear states to ensure they "do not suffer nuclear attacks." The final attitude of the Soviet authorities will depend on the U.S. response, as they believe that the U.S. and the Soviet Union must bear the same responsibilities. Subsequently, Jha also held talks with U.S. President Johnson and others.

According to a report by the *Indian Times* on May 6, the U.S. government recently handed a memorandum to Jha. It stated that Johnson was pleased that the Soviet government took the lead in this matter. He was particularly satisfied that India could arouse the "interest and sympathy" of the Soviet government on this issue. The U.S. government believes that the Soviet government's willingness to take responsibility and help India and other non-nuclear weapon states oppose China is of great significance. Therefore, the U.S. government expressed its heartfelt welcome. The U.S. government is willing to discuss with the Indian government how to jointly issue a declaration or issue a declaration with the Soviet government.

These signs indicate that after intense activities by the U.S., Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries, they have reached some secret agreements in jointly promoting this conspiracy.

    印度反动派力求依靠美苏“核保护”
    一是为了充当反华打手，二是为了引诱非核国家上钩
    新华社六日讯　美帝国主义、苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派，正在加紧推行由美苏给予无核武器国家“核保护”的阴谋。
    印度外交部长查格拉，最近到日内瓦同参加裁军会议的一些国家代表会谈后回到印度。他在四月二十七日发表谈话，公开叫嚷印度必须得到美苏给予的“核保证”。
    实际上，印度政府早就暗中接受美帝国主义的所谓“空中保护伞”（美帝保证在战争时出动空军协助印度政府），同美帝在使用常规武器上结成军事同盟。现在，通过所谓“核保护”，印度政府又将同美苏在使用核武器上结成军事同盟，进一步勾结起来共同反华。
    美苏印的这一活动，也是为五月内在日内瓦裁军会议上讨论防止扩散核武器条约作准备。美帝苏修在炮制这个条约的过程中，遭到了一些障碍。现在就由印度反动派出面，抛出“核保护”的方案来，来诱骗无核武器国家同意签署这个条约。查格拉曾经公开表示，印度政府要设法使防止扩散核武器条约为所有无核武器国家所接受。这显然是使其它无核武器国家，也按照印度卖国政府的榜样，把自己的安全交由美帝苏修这两个核霸王来“保证”，受它们的控制。
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地最近派了她手下的一个官员杰哈为实现这个阴谋到莫斯科和华盛顿去大肆活动。杰哈四月十九日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上透露，他在会见了苏联部长会议主席柯西金和外交部长葛罗米柯以后知道，苏联当局愿意给非核国家提供“书面保证”，使它们“不受核攻击”。苏联当局的最后态度将取决于美国的回答，因为他们认为苏美两国必须承担同样的责任。随后，杰哈又同美国总统约翰逊等人举行了会谈。
    据《印度时报》六日报道，美国政府最近已经把一件备忘录交给杰哈。它指出，约翰逊对苏联政府带头这样干表示高兴。他对印度能够在这个问题上引起苏联政府的“兴趣和同情”，特别感到满意。美国政府认为苏联政府愿意承担责任，帮助印度等无核武器国家反对中国，是有重要意义的，因此美国政府表示衷心欢迎。美国政府愿意同印度政府讨论用什么方式就这件事发表联合宣言，或者同苏联政府一道发表宣言。
    这些迹象表明，美帝、苏修和印度反动派进行了紧张的活动以后，在共同推行这个阴谋上达成了某些秘密协议。
