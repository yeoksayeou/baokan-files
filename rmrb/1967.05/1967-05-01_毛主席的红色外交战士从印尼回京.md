	New China News Agency, May 30th: Mao Chairman's Red Diplomats, Yao Dingshan, the acting head of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and Xu Ren, the Consul General in Jakarta, who were unjustly ordered to leave by the Indonesian reactionary government, returned to the capital Beijing by plane this afternoon. They returned to the side of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao and were warmly welcomed by 7,000 people, including central leaders, revolutionary masses from various circles in the capital, Red Guards, and representatives of Indonesian returnees.

	Those who welcomed them at the airport included: Zhou Enlai, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council; Chen Boda, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group; Kang Sheng, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Advisor to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Li Fuchun, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council; Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, and Tan Zhenlin, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premiers of the State Council; Xu Xiangqian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairman of the State Council and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; Ye Jianying, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; Xiao Hong, Yang Chengwu, and Su Yu, leaders of the People's Liberation Army; Jiang Qing, First Deputy Director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group; Wang Li, Guan Feng, and Chen Boda, members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group; Ye Qun, member of the Military Cultural Revolution Group; Nie Yuanzi, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee; Chao Gangfu, Han Aiqing, and Ding Guoyu, members of the Standing Committee; as well as responsible comrades from various relevant departments such as Liao Chengzhi, Luo Guibo, Zhao Yiqing, Wang Dongxing, Lin Haiyun, Qi Jianying, Qiao Guanhua, Han Nianlong, Xu Yixin, Yao Zhongming, Hao Deqing, Chu Tuonan, Yang Lin, and others.

	Today, the capital airport was adorned with red flags and the sound of drums and gongs echoed through the air. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and banners, awaited the glorious return of our diplomats. They repeatedly read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It seems that reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." They angrily condemned the heinous crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries led by Suharto and Nasution in their frenzied anti-China actions and warned the Indonesian reactionaries once again: The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with! You collude with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to engage in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and you will not have a good end!

	Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren, holding high the portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, stepped out of the aircraft, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, and other comrades, along with international friends who came to welcome them, went to the plane and warmly shook hands and embraced Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren. Zhou Enlai praised Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren, saying, "You have fought well. We welcome you!" At this moment, the crowd at the airport enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

	Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren came to the front of the welcoming crowd. People waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouted slogans such as, "Warmly welcome the diplomats who have fought bravely against the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Salute to the heroic diplomats who have fought bravely!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The welcoming crowd frequently ran out of the ranks to pin Mao badges on Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren. Zhao Xiaoshou, who had fought side by side with Yao Dingshan in Jakarta and protected the five-star national flag with his blood, met Yao Dingshan at the airport. They tightly embraced each other, encouraging each other to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to continue the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. The representatives of the heroic fighting collective of 41 returned overseas Chinese youths who had fought unyieldingly against the U.S. imperialists and Indonesian reactionaries in Medan, Indonesia, paid their respects to Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren. They expressed that the returned overseas Chinese and the people of the entire country will firmly support the just struggle of the broad patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia and firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.

	Revolutionary comrades from various countries who are in Beijing also went to the airport to welcome them. Among them were: Yusuf Ajitorop, head of the delegation of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party and member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee; Indonesian friends Chaharto, Supeno, Isa, Willy and his wife, Suar, and Rasdono; Frank Johnson, secretary of the Central Committee of the (Marxist-Leninist) Communist Party of Australia, and his wife; Ralph Huggins, head of the delegation of the Communist Party of New Zealand and member of the Political Bureau of the National Committee; Oswald Becci and Livio Risaliti, members of the Political Bureau and Secretariat of the Central Committee of the (Marxist-Leninist) Communist Party of Italy; Jack Scott, chairman of the Progressive Workers Movement of Canada, and central committee member Wood; American friends Robert Williams, Li Dunbai, Kofland, and Keros; Japanese friends Ide Junichiro, Ide Kazuko, and Okada Haruko. Those who welcomed at the airport also included diplomatic officials from the embassies of Albania, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea, Syria, and Cambodia in China, as well as the head of the delegation of the Malayan National Liberation League in China and a member of the delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China.

	Yesterday, when Yao Dingshan and Xu Ren returned to Guangzhou, they were warmly welcomed by Chen De, leader of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, Yang Zhen, leader of the Guangzhou Garrison, leaders from various relevant departments, and revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese from various circles.
