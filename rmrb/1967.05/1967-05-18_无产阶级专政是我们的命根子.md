We are filled with immense excitement and most enthusiastically hail the publication of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Notice," personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao!

This "Notice" is a call to arms for the entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire army to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a beacon illuminating the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This "Notice" provides us with the theory, line, principles, and policies for conducting revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through the great practice and victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, the great historical and world significance of this document has been fully demonstrated.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." This is a great truth of Marxism-Leninism. The proletariat, once in power, has everything; without power, it loses everything. In the old society, the proletariat, without power, was nothing but a beast of burden. In our company, there is a "book of hardships." Before liberation, among the relatives of all the soldiers in our company, 234 people carried long-term labor for landlords, 324 people fled and begged for food, 16 people were forced to sell their own children, 75 people were poisoned and killed, and 55 people were conscripted into the army. The reactionary ruling class held the reins of power and the butcher's knife, and the fate of the proletariat was in their hands! We do not want to be slaves; we want to be masters! Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we took up arms to make revolution, and after decades of arduous struggle and bloodshed, the proletariat finally stood up, seized power, and became the masters of the state. This makes us deeply realize that power is our lifeline. And in Peng Zhen's "Draft Report," it is said that "before truth, all are equal," which is completely a pack of lies by the counter-revolutionaries. The bourgeoisie and the proletariat, it is either you seizing power or I seizing power, either you oppressing me or I oppressing you, how can there be equality? The counter-revolutionaries say such things precisely to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, to make us their slaves again. We must never be deceived and must always be vigilant!

We, the People's Liberation Army, are the pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must repeatedly and seriously study this great historical document, the "Notice," and arm ourselves with the theory, line, principles, and policies formulated by Chairman Mao for us. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, maintain high revolutionary vigilance, and firmly hold onto our guns! We will fight to defend the proletarian dictatorship in life and die to defend the proletarian dictatorship in death!

Our army is currently carrying out the glorious tasks assigned by our great leader Chairman Mao, such as supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. Our recent experience tells us that among all forms of support, the most important is the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to promote revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination." We must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, arm the minds of the people of the entire nation with Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that the proletarian dictatorship of our country remains unshakable for generations to come!

We must turn the sky into a sky of Mao Zedong Thought, the earth into earth of Mao Zedong Thought, and people into people armed with Mao Zedong Thought! Following Mao Zedong, the entire army will be red! Following Mao Zedong, the entire nation will be red! Following Mao Zedong, the entire world will be red!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

    无产阶级专政是我们的命根子
    北京市革命委员会委员  北京卫戍区某部四好连队指导员  学习毛主席著作积极分子  孔祥秀
    我们怀着万分兴奋的心情，最最热烈地欢呼伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》的公开发表！
    这个《通知》是号召全党、全国、全军捍卫无产阶级专政的动员令，是照耀无产阶级文化大革命前进道路的指路明灯。这个《通知》为我们制定了在无产阶级专政的条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策。通过一年来文化大革命的伟大实践取得的伟大胜利，充分显示了这个文件的伟大历史意义和世界意义。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”这是一个马克思列宁主义的伟大真理。无产阶级有了政权，就有了一切，没有政权，就丧失一切。在旧社会，无产阶级没有政权，就只有作牛作马。我们连里有一本“苦情账”，解放前，全连战士的亲属中，给地主扛长活的有二百三十四人，逃荒讨饭的三百二十四人，被逼卖掉亲生儿女的十六人，被毒打和杀害的七十五人，被拉去当壮丁的五十五人。反动统治阶级掌握了印把子、刀把子，无产阶级的命运就这样攥在了他们的手里！我们不做奴隶，要做主人！在党和毛主席的领导下，我们拿起枪杆子闹革命，经过了几十年的艰苦奋斗、流血牺牲，无产阶级终于翻了身，掌了权，做了国家的主人。这使我们深深体会到，政权就是我们的命根子。而彭真在《汇报提纲》中说什么“在真理面前人人平等”，这完全是反革命的一派胡说。资产阶级同无产阶级，不是你专我的政，就是我专你的政，不是你压迫我，就是我压迫你，怎么可能平等呢？反革命分子所以要这样说，目的就是要把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，就是要我们重新作他们的奴隶，我们绝对不能上当，千万要警惕！
    我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石，我们一定要反复地认真地学习《通知》这个伟大历史文件，用毛主席为我们制定的理论、路线、方针、政策武装自己，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，保持高度的革命警惕，牢牢握紧枪杆子！生为保卫无产阶级政权而战斗，死为保卫无产阶级政权而献身！
    我们军队目前正执行着伟大领袖毛主席交给我们的支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项光荣任务，前一段经验告诉我们，千支援，万支援，宣传毛泽东思想是最大的支援。我们要用毛泽东思想促进革命的大联合，促进革命的“三结合”。我们要大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，用毛泽东思想武装全国人民的头脑，保证我们国家的无产阶级专政的江山，千秋万代永不变色！
    我们要把天变成毛泽东思想的天，把地变成毛泽东思想的地，把人变成毛泽东思想武装起来的人！跟着毛泽东，全军一片红！跟着毛泽东，全国一片红！跟着毛泽东，世界一片红！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
