President Nyerere of Tanzania visited two projects built with Chinese aid on the morning of May 5. He warmly praised China's assistance to Tanzania.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Dar es Salaam, May 5 - Tanzania President Nyerere visited the Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory and the Ruwu State Farm, both of which are being built with Chinese aid. When he saw Chinese experts working side by side with Tanzanian workers, he praised, "This is a living school." He also told Tanzanian workers, "You workers are the main force in implementing the policy of self-reliance."

The completion of these two projects will help the Tanzanian people achieve self-sufficiency in clothing and food.

President Nyerere happily inspected the construction site. On this previously overgrown site, thanks to the joint efforts of Tanzanian workers and Chinese experts, steel-framed buildings are now rising one after another, presenting a bustling and tense scene.

President Nyerere enthusiastically watched Tanzanian workers install various machines. Under the patient guidance and help of Chinese experts, many ordinary workers have now mastered complex specialized technologies. The president praised, "This is a living school." Through this construction project, Tanzanian workers can learn a lot of technical knowledge and experience from Chinese experts, who are exemplary in their hard work.

President Nyerere met Chinese technician Zhao Zhensheng on the construction site. Zhao had been injured on the site last October and had his left arm amputated. The president shook Zhao's hand warmly, expressing his heartfelt condolences. The Chinese technician told the president, "Chairman Mao teaches us to contribute to Tanzania's national construction and promote friendship between the Chinese and African peoples. I am very happy that I can still serve the Tanzanian people with my remaining arm."

President Nyerere moved and said, "Thank you."

Before visiting this textile printing and dyeing factory under construction, President Nyerere visited the Ruwu State Farm, about 80 kilometers west of Dar es Salaam. The head of the Chinese farm expert group showed President Nyerere the design plan of the farm, which covers an area of 7,000 acres, and introduced the farm's construction plan.

When he saw that three or four Chinese experts lived in a small wooden house, President Nyerere praised the Chinese experts' simple living conditions and hardworking spirit.

    尼雷尔总统参观中国援建的两项工程 
    热烈赞扬我对坦桑尼亚的援助
    据新华社达累斯萨拉姆五日电　坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔五日上午视察了中国援助坦桑尼亚兴建的友谊纺织印染厂和鲁伍国营农场的建筑工程。当他看到中国专家同坦桑尼亚工人肩并肩地工作时赞扬说：“这是一座活生生的学校。”他还向坦桑尼亚工人说：“你们工人是执行自力更生政策的主力。”
    这两个工程的建成，将有助于坦桑尼亚人民实现在衣食方面自给自足的目标。
    尼雷尔总统高兴地参观了建筑工地。在这个过去灌木丛生的工地上，由于坦桑尼亚工人和中国专家的共同劳动，钢骨建筑物现在已经一座接一座地平地升起，呈现一片繁忙紧张的景象。
    尼雷尔总统兴致勃勃地观看了坦桑尼亚工人安装各种机器。在中国专家耐心培养和帮助下，许多普通工人现在已经掌握了复杂的专门技术。总统赞扬说，“这是一座活生生的学校。”通过这项建设工程，坦桑尼亚工人可以从中国专家那里学到许多技术知识和经验，中国专家是辛勤劳动的榜样。
    尼雷尔总统在建筑工地上遇到了中国技工赵振声，他去年十月在工地上执行任务时受了伤，左臂截去了。总统紧紧地握住赵振声的手，表示亲切的慰问。这位中国技工对总统说：“毛主席教导我们，要为坦桑尼亚的国家建设作出贡献，增进中国人民和非洲人民的友谊，我很高兴，我还能用剩下来的一只手为坦桑尼亚人民服务。”
    尼雷尔总统感动地说：“谢谢你。”
    在访问这个正在兴建中的纺织印染厂之前，尼雷尔总统访问了达累斯萨拉姆以西约八十公里的鲁伍国营农场。中国农场专家组组长请尼雷尔总统观看了这个占地七千英亩的农场的设计图，并介绍了农场的建设规划。
    当看到中国专家三、四个人住在一间小木屋里时，尼雷尔总统称赞中国专家这种简朴的生活和努力工作的精神。
