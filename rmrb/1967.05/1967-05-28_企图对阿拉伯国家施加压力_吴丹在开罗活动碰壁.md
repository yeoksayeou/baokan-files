United Nations Secretary-General U Thant faced obstacles during his activities in Cairo and left hurriedly a day earlier on May 25 to return to New York.

Following the instigation by U.S. imperialism of its tool of aggression, Israel, to issue threats of invasion against Arab countries, U Thant, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, arrived in Cairo on May 23 to engage in activities aimed at exerting pressure on Arab countries.

During his stay in Cairo, U Thant held several meetings with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mahmoud Riad and also met with President Nasser. According to reports, Egypt insisted on the withdrawal of the "United Nations Emergency Force" and maintained its sovereignty over the Gulf of Aqaba.

Before and after U Thant's arrival in Cairo, Egypt continued its military preparations. Egypt issued orders to mobilize reserves. Due to the need for military transportation, the road from Cairo to Alexandria was closed to general traffic.

On the evening of May 24, air raid drills were conducted in Cairo and all cities in Lower Egypt. Anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist banners and cartoons appeared on the streets. Nationwide donation campaigns were launched.

    企图对阿拉伯国家施加压力
    吴丹在开罗活动碰壁
    据新华社开罗二十六日电　联合国秘书长吴丹在开罗活动遭到碰壁后，提前一天于二十五日匆匆忙忙离开这里前往纽约。
    在美帝国主义怂恿它的侵略工具以色列对阿拉伯国家发出侵略威胁后，吴丹在美帝的授意下，于二十三日到达开罗活动，企图对阿拉伯国家施加压力。
    吴丹在开罗活动期间，曾几次会晤阿联外交部长里亚德，并会见了纳赛尔总统。据报道，阿联坚持要求“联合国紧急部队”撤走，并坚持阿联对亚喀巴湾的主权。
    在吴丹到达开罗进行活动前后，阿联继续进行军事准备工作。阿联下达了动员后备役的命令。由于军事运输的需要，从开罗通往塞得港的公路已经停止一般车辆的通行。
    二十四日晚，在开罗和下埃及的所有城市进行了空袭警报演习。街头上出现了反对帝国主义和反对犹太复国主义的横幅大标语和漫画。全国各地掀起了捐献运动。
