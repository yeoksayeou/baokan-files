The Vietnamese Government Issues Statement Strongly Protesting U.S. Imperialist Large-Scale Invasion of Demilitarized Zone
Vietnamese People Will Surely Punish the U.S. Aggressors

Hanoi, May 21 (Xinhua) — The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today strongly protesting the extremely serious act of war escalation by the U.S. imperialists and their puppets, who have been invading the demilitarized zone in large numbers since May 18.

The statement points out that for over a decade, U.S. imperialism and its Saigon puppets have systematically violated the demilitarized zone regulations. They have cut off the contact between the two sides' people across the temporary military demarcation line. They have used armed forces to oppress the people on the south bank of the Ben Hai River and provoked the people on the north bank. They have sent planes to frequently drop chemical poisons in the demilitarized zone. Most seriously, since August 5, 1964, U.S. imperialism has continuously sent its air force across the temporary military demarcation line to invade the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, bombing and strafing it. Since February 1967, while escalating its air and naval operations, it has also used various types of artillery from south of the 17th parallel to continuously shell villages inside and outside the demilitarized zone in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. It has also intensified the destruction of villages in the "southern" part of the demilitarized zone, forcing the people there into various forms of concentration camps, attempting to create a "no-man's-land" in this region. The large-scale dispatch of U.S. expeditionary forces and puppets to the demilitarized zone is the most serious new development in the U.S. plot to destroy the buffer zone between North and South Vietnam.

The statement says: "After the Guam conference, U.S. imperialism has sent a large number of troops and coerced its vassals to send more troops to strengthen the war of aggression in South Vietnam. On the other hand, it has continuously attacked the industrial areas of Quang Ninh, Vinh Phuc, Thai Nguyen, and Haiphong, and many densely populated areas in North Vietnam. Currently, U.S. planes almost daily bomb and strafe the capital Hanoi, deliberately attacking residential areas and facilities serving the people's lives. Under these circumstances, the U.S. and puppet forces' invasion of the demilitarized zone makes the situation in Vietnam extremely serious.

"This is obviously a new 'escalation,' which proves that the U.S. is breaking the demilitarized zone regulations, intensifying the war of aggression against Vietnam, and attempting to escape its failure and quagmire in South Vietnam. The U.S. government's evasive denials and so-called 'peace efforts' are merely shameless deception tactics. The U.S.'s new war 'escalation' is a serious violation of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue, a direct threat to the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with ground forces, and a brazen provocation to the people of the world who are demanding that the U.S. government must stop its aggression against Vietnam."

The statement says: "The Vietnamese people love peace very much, but they are not afraid of hardships and sacrifices, and they will fight to the end to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland and contribute to the maintenance of peace in Indochina and Asia. The Vietnamese people's just war of resistance against U.S. imperialist aggressors has achieved great victories and will surely achieve final victory."

The statement strongly condemns the above extremely dangerous acts of war escalation by the U.S.

The statement says: "The U.S. government must thoroughly respect the demilitarized zone regulations, must immediately withdraw all armed forces of the U.S. and the Saigon puppet regime from the demilitarized zone, and must immediately stop all military activities in the demilitarized zone. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sternly warns the U.S. government that if it continues to violate the demilitarized zone regulations and obstinately escalates the war, the Vietnamese people will give a resolute counterattack and will surely give the U.S. expeditionary forces the punishment they deserve. The U.S. government will be fully responsible for all the serious consequences it has caused in the demilitarized zone.

"The U.S. government must stop the war of aggression against Vietnam, must immediately and unconditionally stop bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, must withdraw all U.S. troops and their mercenary forces from South Vietnam, and must thoroughly respect the various national rights of the Vietnamese people as recognized in the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue."

The statement calls on all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world to strongly condemn and resolutely stop the U.S. plot and actions to intensify and escalate the war of aggression against Vietnam.

    越南政府发表声明强烈抗议美帝大规模进犯非军事区
    越南人民必将给美国侵略军以应得惩罚
    新华社河内二十一日电　越南民主共和国政府二十一日发表声明，强烈抗议美国从五月十八日以来，派遣美伪军大规模进犯非军事区的极其严重的扩大战争行动。
    声明指出，十多年来，美帝国主义及其西贡走狗集团不断地有系统地违反非军事区规定。正是它们切断了两方人民经过临时军事分界线的来往。正是它们使用武装力量迫害边海河南岸人民，并对北岸人民进行挑衅。正是它们派遣飞机经常在非军事区撒放化学毒药。特别严重的是，一九六四年八月五日以来，美帝国主义连续派遣空军通过临时军事分界线侵犯北方领空，轰炸、扫射越南民主共和国。一九六七年二月以来，它在用空军和海军加紧进行“升级”的同时，还使用各种大炮从第十七度线以南接连轰击非军事区内外的越南民主共和国的许多村庄。它还加紧摧毁非军事区“南部”的村庄，强迫那里的人民到各个变相的集中营去，妄图在这个地区设立一个“无人地带”。美帝国主义大规模向非军事区派遣美国远征军和伪军，是美国旨在破坏越南北南两方之间的缓冲区的阴谋中的最严重的新发展。
    声明说：“在关岛会议之后，美帝国主义增派了大批军队，同时胁迫其仆从增派军队以加强侵略越南南方的战争。另一方面，对越南北方，它接连袭击广宁、越池、太原、海防市等各个工业区和许多居民稠密区。目前，美国飞机几乎天天轰炸、扫射首都河内市，蓄意袭击居民区和为人民生活服务的设施。美军和伪军在这种情况下进犯非军事区，更加使越南局势变得极其严重。
    “这显然是一次新的‘升级’，它证明美国破坏非军事区规定，大力加强侵略越南的战争，妄图摆脱它在越南南方的失败和陷入泥潭的处境。美国当局拐弯抹角的抵赖和所谓的‘和平努力’，只不过是无耻的欺骗手段。美国的新战争‘升级’，是对一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的严重破坏，是以陆军对越南民主共和国领土进行直接威胁，是对正在纷纷要求美国政府必须停止侵略越南的世界人民的蛮横挑衅。”
    声明说：“越南人民非常热爱和平，但不怕艰苦和牺牲，坚决战斗到底，以保卫祖国的独立和自由，为维护印度支那和亚洲和平作出贡献。越南人民反对美帝国主义侵略者的正义抗战取得了巨大的胜利，并且必将取得最后胜利。”
    声明强烈控诉美国的上述极其危险的扩大战争的行动。
    声明说：“美国政府必须彻底尊重非军事区规定，必须立即把美国和西贡伪政权的一切武装力量撤出非军事区，必须立即停止在非军事区的一切军事活动。越南民主共和国政府严厉警告美国政府，如果它一味继续破坏非军事区规定，顽固地扩大战争，越南人民将给予坚决的反击，并且必将给美国远征军以应得的惩罚。美国政府要对它在非军事区造成的一切严重后果承担全部责任。”
    “美国政府必须停止侵略越南的战争，必须无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和其他一切战争行动，必须把美国军队及其帮凶军全部撤出越南南方，必须彻底尊重一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议所确认的越南人民的各种民族权利。”
    声明呼吁世界上一切爱好和平的国家和人民，严厉谴责和坚决制止美国加强和扩大侵略越南的战争的阴谋和行动。
