At a crucial moment when the people of the entire nation are launching a comprehensive offensive against the top capitalist-roader within the Party, a grand congress of the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought from large and middle schools in Guizhou Province was held in Guiyang. The congress announced the formal establishment of the Guizhou Province Congress of the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought (the unified name for the Red Guards in the entire province).

The congress unanimously passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved and red sun, Chairman Mao, sincerely wishing our great leader, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Nearly 3,000 revolutionary youths from the revolutionary city of Zunyi, the areas of the Piling Mountains traversed by the Red Army during the Long March, and all directions of the Guizhou Plateau participated in this congress. This congress is a rally to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death and resolutely criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party. It is a congress of great unity and struggle among revolutionary youths of all ethnic groups in the province. During the congress, Red Guard representatives from various places, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, displayed the daring spirit of revolution to think, speak, act, and rebel, and to "suffer a thousand cuts and dare to pull the emperor from his throne." They launched fierce attacks against the top capitalist-roader within the Party. At the rally, criticism meetings, and symposiums held during the congress, the revolutionary youths were indignant, exposing the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. Red Guard representatives from various ethnic groups such as Han, Miao, Buyi, Dong, and Shuai all emphasized in their speeches that the current nationwide campaign to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents is a life-and-death class struggle. It is a major event that concerns the future and destiny of the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of the world. We revolutionary youths must stand firm, hold high the banner, and unite closely with the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction to organize a mighty revolutionary army. We will criticize and expose the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents, thoroughly eradicate his poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," and eliminate its influence. At the same time, we will combine this with the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform in large and middle schools, cut off his black hands in various fields, and achieve greater victories in the Guizhou proletarian cultural revolution!

The representatives pointed out in their speeches that we must, in this great struggle of criticism and struggle, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further promote the great unity and struggle of the Red Guard revolutionary youths, advance the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and complete the great task of struggle, criticism, and reform in large and middle schools, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

At the congress, the representatives expressed their determination to study and apply Chairman Mao's works diligently, break down the "self" and establish the "public," resolutely oppose and criticize anarchism, and overcome non-proletarian thoughts such as individualism, liberalism, and sectarianism. They will strengthen their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, turn the Red Guards into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and cultivate themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, ensuring that the socialist iron mountain will never change color for thousands of years.

During the congress, Red Guard representatives from various places also extensively exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and in the cultural revolution struggle.

This congress was held under the direct leadership of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guizhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Leaders from the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Guizhou Military Region attended the congress and, in their speeches, warmly praised the immortal merits established by the broad revolutionary Red Guard youths in the proletarian cultural revolution. They called on the revolutionary youths to actively participate in the mass movement of criticizing and struggling against the top capitalist-roader within the Party, pushing the proletarian cultural revolution to a new stage.

The congress, in a warm round of applause, passed the resolution of the Guizhou Province Congress of the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought from large and middle schools. This congress began on April 10th and concluded on the 20th, amidst the solemn and majestic music of "The East Is Red" and the enthusiastic shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!"
