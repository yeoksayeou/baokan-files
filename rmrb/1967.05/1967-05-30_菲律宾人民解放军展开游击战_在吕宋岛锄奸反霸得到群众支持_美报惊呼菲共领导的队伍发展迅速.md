The Philippine People's Liberation Army, led by the Philippine Communist Party, has recently been actively engaging in guerrilla warfare on the island of Luzon, achieving numerous victories.

According to recent reports from Manila newspapers, the Philippine People's Liberation Army has been increasingly taking the initiative in combat. On May 18, the Philippine People's Liberation Army fought a brilliant battle, ambushing a so-called "security force" sent to suppress the peasants. The "security force" was caught off guard, with many killed, and even those who managed to escape did not know how their comrades were killed.

The Philippine People's Liberation Army is resolutely implementing the Philippine Communist Party's program of opposing American imperialism and feudalism, actively engaging in armed struggle, and gaining increasingly broad support from the workers and peasants. This has helped to develop and strengthen the armed struggle forces.

Reports indicate that in central Luzon, the Philippine People's Liberation Army has been supporting peasants in rooting out traitors and fighting against local tyrants, earning the love and support of the peasantry. This army not only fights brilliant battles in guerrilla warfare but has also grown into a powerful political force. The American newspaper *The New York Times* recently lamented that in several provinces in central Luzon, the Philippine Communist Party and its led People's Liberation Army "have become the most powerful political force." The American magazine *Time* also expressed concern, stating that the Philippine People's Liberation Army "has already controlled, to varying degrees, an area of 1,400 square miles and a population of 500,000 people. However, their political power has grown even faster than their territory (referring to their base areas)."

    新华社二十九日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾共产党领导下的菲律宾人民解放军最近在吕宋岛积极展开游击战，捷报频传。
    据马尼拉报纸最近透露，菲律宾人民解放军最近越来越经常地主动出击。五月十八日菲律宾人民解放军打了一场漂亮仗，在伏击一支镇压农民的所谓“保安队”中，把“保安队”打得昏头昏脑，击毙多人，甚至连侥幸逃生的“保安队员”也不知道他们的“伙伴”是怎样被打死的。
    菲律宾人民解放军坚决执行菲律宾共产党的反对美帝国主义和反对封建主义的纲领，积极展开武装斗争，并且在斗争中获得越来越广泛的工农群众的拥护和支持，发展和壮大了武装斗争的队伍。
    据报道，菲律宾人民解放军在吕宋中部支持农民锄奸反霸，受到了农民群众的爱戴和拥护。这支军队不仅能在游击战争中打漂亮仗，并且成长为强大的政治力量。美国的《纽约时报》最近哀叹说，在吕宋中部的几个省份，菲律宾共产党和它所领导下的人民解放军“已成为最有权力的政治力量”。美国《时代》杂志也忧心忡忡地说，菲律宾人民解放军“已经在不同程度上控制了一千四百平方英里的土地和五十万人口，但是他们的政治权力比他们的地盘（指根据地）增长得更快。”
