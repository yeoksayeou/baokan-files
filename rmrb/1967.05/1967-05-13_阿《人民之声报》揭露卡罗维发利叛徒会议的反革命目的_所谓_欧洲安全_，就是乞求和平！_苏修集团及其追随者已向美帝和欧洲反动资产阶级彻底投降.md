Albanian "People's Voice" Exposes the Treacherous Purpose of the Karlovy Vary Meeting

The so-called "European security" is nothing but begging for peace!

The Soviet revisionist clique and its followers have completely surrendered to U.S. imperialism and the European reactionary bourgeoisie.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on the 10th, the editorial department of the Albanian "People's Voice" published an article titled "What Does the Karlovy Vary Traitorous Meeting Indicate?" on the 5th.

The article points out that the document on "Striving for Peace and Security in Europe" passed by the revisionists at this treacherous meeting is a begging letter to the imperialists and the European reactionary bourgeoisie.

The article states that this meeting has fully exposed the degeneration and fall of the Khrushchev revisionists to the world public opinion, their complete surrender to the bourgeoisie and other reactionary forces, and their transformation into a small group of social reformists who serve capitalism and counter-revolution wholeheartedly. They shed tears and kowtow, begging the European big bourgeoisie, big monopolies, Vatican dignitaries, leaders of social democratic parties, yellow unions, and the rulers and reactionaries of Western Europe to accept their call for unity and to take in this group of revisionist "lost sheep."

The article points out that the tone of the resolution of the Karlovy Vary meeting and the speeches of the revisionist leaders at the meeting is to achieve "peace at any cost" between socialism and capitalism, between the oppressed and the oppressors, between revolution and counter-revolution, between colonies and mother countries, and between the victims of imperialist aggression and the imperialist aggressors. The revisionists eagerly use the outdated slogan of "European security" to cover up their fervent desire to join the European capitalist chorus. However, this trick can no longer deceive anyone.

Colluding with the bourgeoisie and making big deals with U.S. imperialism

The article states that at Karlovy Vary, the revisionist leaders tried to unite with the entire bourgeoisie in Europe and the world, claiming it was to oppose the militaristic and revanchist policies of the Federal Republic of Germany. Is it that only the Federal Republic of Germany is threatening peace, and the reactionary bourgeoisie in the world is not threatening peace? This is precisely the "logic" of the revisionists, and this is precisely their shocking betrayal.

The article states that the revisionists in their statement talk about how "the infiltration of American capital in Europe" makes them uneasy. This is truly absurd. The Khrushchev revisionists themselves are opening the door to American capital. Currently, the European monopoly capitalist groups investing in the Soviet Union are directly funded by American banks with the approval of the U.S. government. For example, it is known that the several hundred million dollars spent by the Italian Fiat Company to build an automobile factory in the Soviet Union is a loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to Fiat. Other European monopoly capitalist groups investing in revisionist countries, even if they are not generally subsidiaries of American monopoly capitalist groups, are closely linked to American monopoly capitalist groups.

The alliance with U.S. imperialism and the line of Soviet-American cooperation are the cornerstones of today's Khrushchev revisionist foreign policy. Recently, the Soviet Union has signed a series of agreements with the United States, and now they are together in Geneva to finalize the draft of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. At the same time, representatives of both sides are in Moscow discussing the issue of banning defensive anti-ballistic missiles. Johnson insists on asking the U.S. Senate to lift all restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union, and the Khrushchev revisionists highly praise the sincere relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

The article states that regarding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the revisionists claim that it has "changed" and is no longer a danger, etc. Based on this belief, they are trying to erase the Warsaw Treaty and asking the Atlantic Pact partners to follow their example.

They shout the anti-socialist and anti-internationalist slogan of "Europe for Europeans" in words, but in reality, they hope and actively work for the United States to maintain its power in Europe. They say "the United States is a danger" in words, but in reality, they are allies of the United States like the Federal Republic of Germany. They hypocritically target the Federal Republic of Germany, but they have established contacts with it, and over time, they will further strengthen this contact in defiance of the Karlovy Vary declaration.

Maintaining the capitalist system and promoting capitalist restoration

The article further points out that the so-called European security that the Khrushchev revisionists envision and strive to achieve is a new surrender of the Khrushchev revisionists, a new conspiracy between the revisionists and the imperialists. This conspiracy is to eliminate socialism and communism from the earth, to maintain and guarantee the capitalist system. It is not accidental that the revisionists are vigorously promoting and conducting diplomatic activities for "European security" at a time when economic reforms are being carried out in the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. "European security" and "European cooperation" are slogans carefully selected by the revisionists, a means to defend their capitalist restoration and its inevitable consequences—the integration into the old economic system of the European bourgeoisie.

The article states that a very typical fact is that the Karlovy Vary declaration does not call for—even with deceptive calls—the working people to fight a revolution to free themselves from capitalist slavery and exploitation, to struggle for their rights and democratic freedoms. The declaration, even when it mentions the working people, only advocates that the working people strive for general economic rights demands of a social democratic nature, not a word about resistance, only about surrender to bourgeois slavery and monopoly, only about class cooperation and class surrender, only about obeying the capitalist order and "living in peace with everyone," only about begging.

Diversion of global attention to serve U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam

The article states that the Khrushchev revisionists, when they raise the "European issue" at the negotiating table and in international exchanges, they aim to achieve a very clear and definite goal. They do everything possible to ensure the tranquility of the U.S. imperialists in Europe, hoping to establish a new basis for the concrete implementation of Soviet-American cooperation, so that the military and political forces of the United States in Asia can first direct their attacks at Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. Western newspapers have long reported that many divisions of troops stationed in Europe have been successively transferred to Asia. No matter how loudly the revisionists shout in support of Vietnam, it is clear that their conspiracy for European security has only one purpose: to divert global attention from the Vietnam War and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of other countries.

The hypocritical appeal on the Vietnam issue passed by the Karlovy Vary meeting is worthless. The means that the revisionists are playing with regarding the Vietnam issue will no longer succeed.

Now, irrefutable evidence shows that the Soviet leaders are doing everything possible to bring the resolution of the Vietnam issue within the scope of Soviet-American cooperation, using this issue as a propaganda tool for their joint anti-China campaign. Moscow has now become the main nest of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries to plot against Vietnam, the main nest to formulate plans to deceive Vietnam and make it deviate from the correct path of the people's anti-aggression struggle.

On the surface, "harmonious" but in reality, scheming

People have never seen such a shameful, outdated, monotonous, false, general, and fruitless international meeting as the one held by these revisionists in Karlovy Vary. The leaders of modern revisionism, headed by Brezhnev, one after another, stepped onto the podium, repeating the same sentences without confidence. Obviously, no one believes what they say themselves. Their speeches are just a performance to cover up what they dare not say and cannot say openly. On the podium of the former palace in Karlovy Vary, these revisionist leaders are indeed speaking, but their minds are elsewhere. Although they issued a vulgar joint statement, each person has their own real plan in their pocket. For the sake of maintaining face, from their speeches and documents, it seems that there is so-called unity, but in reality, they are engaged in a struggle of scheming against each other. People find that the story of thunder without rain has been repeated. Their statements have nothing new. They are just a pile of words, the purpose of which is to make all revisionist groups feel happy, save face, and not damage the interests and plans of each participant.

The article states that the Karlovy Vary meeting has not been able to mend the gaps in the revisionist line, nor has it been able to strengthen the Soviet Union's dominant position in this line and consolidate the disunited ranks of Khrushchev's allies. Pure bourgeois relations have now appeared and continue to appear among them, and these relations are changing according to the situation and according to the special national interests that no meeting or activity can solve.

Of course, they are united in their struggle against Marxism-Leninism, but in this struggle, each person also has their own special interests, each person tries to achieve goals that only they care about, tries to gain advantage and influence, and makes deals. In this contradictory group, the Soviet leadership finds it difficult to restore order, determine a consistent view and attitude, let alone one that fully conforms to its interests and purposes.

It is necessary to draw a clear line with the traitors and carry out the anti-revisionist struggle to the end

The Soviet leaders, in order to conduct propaganda and avoid returning empty-handed, then demanded that the other participants pay some respect or congratulations to them on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. However, relying on the great socialist revolution and the glory of the first socialist country to speculate is no longer deceptive to anyone. The Khrushchev revisionists have betrayed Lenin, betrayed the people who overthrew the tsarist regime and established the Soviets 50 years ago, and betrayed the blood of 20 million Soviet people who fought to defend their homeland and liberate Europe from the clutches of fascism. Undoubtedly, the clouds gathering over the homeland of the October Socialist Revolution will one day disperse. The great and immortal thoughts of Lenin and Stalin, which live in the hearts of the Soviet people and are written on the revolutionary battle flags of the true communists of the Soviet Union, will certainly defeat the revisionists who have usurped the leadership of the party and the state.

The article states that the Khrushchev revisionists hope to use their Karlovy Vary meeting to engage in deception and new fraud. Now, Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people of all countries are very familiar with the tactics of revisionism, they can correctly analyze various situations, and draw absolutely necessary conclusions. Undoubtedly, in the face of the new conspiracies plotted by the revisionists, they will further strengthen the unity of their ranks and fight more vigorously to expose revisionism.

The task of Marxist-Leninists and all true revolutionaries is to completely draw a clear line with the revisionist traitors. These revisionist traitors, due to their betrayal and conspiratorial activities, have already placed themselves outside the anti-imperialist front and outside the international communist movement.

The article concludes that in Europe where revisionism is rampant, the revolutionary forces that can lead the struggle against imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and opportunism are the Marxist-Leninists. The future belongs to them. In the name of the future, in the name of revolution and socialism, they should unite all forces and resolutely fight against imperialism and its lackeys, the Khrushchev revisionists.

At the very beginning of the great October Socialist Revolution, Lenin bravely broke away from the Russian opportunist social democrats and the traitors of the Second International, and waged the most courageous and resolute struggle against them. This important revolutionary measure was one of the fundamental conditions and guarantees for the victory of the revolution. We must always cherish this great historical lesson.

To achieve the victory of the revolution, we must resolutely and unhesitatingly fight to the end against modern revisionism, the main danger to the international communist movement.

    阿《人民之声报》揭露卡罗维发利叛徒会议的反革命目的
    所谓“欧洲安全”，就是乞求和平！
    苏修集团及其追随者已向美帝和欧洲反动资产阶级彻底投降
    据新华社地拉那十日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》五日发表一篇题为《卡罗维发利叛徒会议说明了什么问题》的编辑部文章。
    文章指出，修正主义者在这次叛卖的会议上所通过的关于“争取欧洲和平与安全”的文件，是向帝国主义者和欧洲反动资产阶级要求施舍的乞怜书。
    文章说，这次会议在世界公众舆论面前公开暴露了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的蜕化堕落、他们向资产阶级及其他反动势力的彻底投降，以及他们终于变成了彻头彻尾为资本主义制度和反革命效劳的一小撮社会改良主义者。他们眼泪汪汪、奴颜婢膝地乞求欧洲大资产阶级、大垄断资本集团、教廷显贵、社会民主党的头目、黄色工会以及西欧的统治者和反动派，接受他们发出的主张一体化的呼吁并能把这群修正主义“迷途羔羊”收容下来。
    文章指出，在社会主义和资本主义之间，在被压迫者和压迫者之间，在革命和反革命之间，在殖民地和宗主国之间，在帝国主义侵略的受害者和帝国主义侵略者之间，实现“不惜一切代价的和平”，这就是卡罗维发利会议的决议文件以及修正主义头目在会上的发言的基调。修正主义者竭力用“欧洲安全”这个陈腐的口号来掩盖他们参加欧洲资本主义大合唱的狂热愿望。但是，这种伎俩再也骗不了任何人。
    同资产阶级联合和美帝大做交易
    文章说，在卡罗维发利，修正主义头目们力求同欧洲和世界上的整个资产阶级搞联合，说什么是为了反对德意志联邦共和国的军国主义和复仇主义政策。这是不是说，只有德意志联邦共和国在威胁和平，世界上的反动资产阶级并不威胁和平？而这恰恰是修正主义者的“逻辑”，这恰恰是他们骇人听闻的叛卖。
    文章说，修正主义者在他们的声明中侈谈什么“美国资本在欧洲加紧渗入”使他们感到不安。这真是滑天下之大稽。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者自己正在向美国资本敞开大门。目前在苏联投资的欧洲垄断资本集团是由美国大银行在美国政府的批准下直接资助的。例如大家知道，意大利菲亚特公司在苏联建设汽车制造厂所要花费的几亿美元，是美国进出口银行给菲亚特公司的贷款。向修正主义国家投资的欧洲其他垄断资本集团，即使一般情况下不是美国垄断资本集团的分公司的话，也是同美国垄断资本集团有十分紧密联系的。
    同美帝的联盟，美苏合作的路线，是今天赫鲁晓夫修正主义者外交政策的基石。近来，苏联已同美国缔结了一系列协议，现在它们正一起在日内瓦要最后制定防止核扩散条约草案。同时，双方代表在莫斯科就禁止防御性的反导弹导弹的问题谈得一团火热。约翰逊坚持要求美国参议院取消同苏联贸易的一切限制，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者则大肆赞扬苏美的诚挚关系。
    文章说，对于北大西洋公约组织，修正主义者声称，它已有了“变化”，不再是一种危险了等等。他们基于这种信念，正在竭力设法勾销华沙条约，要求大西洋集团的伙伴仿效他们的榜样。
    他们在口头上喊什么“欧洲人的欧洲”这个反社会主义、反国际主义的口号，实际上却希望并为美国在欧洲保持自己的势力积极活动。他们在口头上说“美国是一种危险”，但是实际上他们象德意志联邦共和国一样是美国的同盟军，他们假惺惺地把德意志联邦共和国当作攻击目标，但是他们已与它建立了联系，随着时间的推移，他们将不顾卡罗维发利声明进一步加强这种联系。
    维护资本主义制度推行资本主义复辟
    文章接着指出，实际上，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者设想和力求实现的所谓欧洲安全，是赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的一次新的投降，是修正主义者和帝国主义者的一个新的阴谋。这个阴谋就是要把社会主义和共产主义从地球上消灭掉，就是要保持和保证资本主义制度。修正主义者恰恰在苏联和其他东欧国家正在实行经济改革的时候，为“欧洲安全”拚命宣传和进行外交活动，这决不是偶然的。“欧洲安全”和“欧洲合作”，是修正主义者精心挑选的口号，是为他们在自己的国家里推行资本主义复辟及其不可避免的后果——并入欧洲资产阶级旧经济体系辩护的一种手段。
    文章说，非常典型的事实是：卡罗维发利声明根本不号召——连蛊惑人心的号召都没有——劳动人民为摆脱资本主义奴役和剥削，为争取他们的权利和民主自由而进行革命斗争。声明即使谈到劳动人民的时候，也只是主张劳动人民争取社会民主党性质的改良主义的一般经济权利要求，只字不提抵抗，只讲向资产阶级的奴役和垄断屈服，只讲阶级合作和阶级屈服，只讲服从资本主义的秩序和“同人人和平相处”，只有恳求。
    转移全世界视线为美帝侵越效劳
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子在谈判桌上和国际交往中提出“欧洲问题”时，他们企图达到一个非常明确、非常确定的目标。他们千方百计确保美帝国主义者在欧洲的安宁，妄想这样来建立具体实行苏美合作的新基础，以便由两大国瓜分势力范围，并创造使美国在亚洲的军事和政治力量的攻击矛头首先指向越南和中华人民共和国的新的可能性。西方报刊早就不断报道，驻扎在欧洲的许多个师的军队相继调往亚洲。无论修正主义分子在支持越南方面叫得多么响，可是十分清楚，他们关于欧洲安全的阴谋，其唯一目的是要转移全世界对越南战争和其他国家人民的反帝革命斗争的注意力。
    卡罗维发利会议通过的关于越南问题的虚伪呼吁书，是一钱不值的。修正主义分子竭力就越南问题玩弄的手段，是再也不会得逞的。
    现在，无可辩驳的事实证明，苏联领导人千方百计要把越南问题的解决纳入苏美合作范围，利用这个问题作为他们共同反华的宣传手段。莫斯科现在变成了帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派制造反对越南的阴谋的主要巢穴，成了他们制订计划以欺骗越南和使越南脱离反侵略人民斗争的正确道路的主要巢穴。
    表面上“一团和气”实际上勾心斗角
    人们从未见过象这些修正主义者在卡罗维发利所举行的如此可耻，如此过时，如此单调，如此虚假，如此一般化和毫无结果的国际会议。以勃列日涅夫为首的这些现代修正主义的头头们，一个接一个地登上讲坛，毫无信心地在那里重复着同样的话句。显然，谁都不相信他自己所说的东西。他们的讲话只不过是一场为了掩饰他们不敢说出和不能公开地说出的东西的演出而已。在卡罗维发利的前王宫的讲坛上，的确，这些修正主义的头目们是在讲话，但是，他们的心思却在别处。他们虽然在那里发表了庸俗的联合声明，但是每个人口袋里都有自己真正的计划。为了维护面子起见，从他们的讲话和文件来看，似乎是存在着所谓的团结，但是实际上他们彼此之间却在进行勾心斗角的斗争。人们发现，重演了雷声大雨点小的故事。他们的声明没有任何新东西。这只是一些词汇的堆积而已，其目的是要使所有修正主义集团感到高兴，保存面子和不致破坏每个与会者的利益和计划。
    文章说，卡罗维发利会议没有能修补修正主义阵线里的缺口，也没有能加强苏联对这个阵线的统治地位和巩固赫鲁晓夫的盟友们的不团结的队伍。在它们之间现在已经出现，并且继续在出现纯资产阶级的关系，这些关系正在根据局势的变化和根据那些任何会议和活动都不能解决的特殊的民族利益而起着变化。
    当然，他们在反对马克思列宁主义的斗争中是团结一致的，但是，在这场斗争中，每个人也有自己的特殊利益，每个人企图达到只有他才关心的目的，企图取得优势和影响，并进行交易。在这个矛盾重重的集团里，苏联领导集团难于恢复秩序，确定一致的看法和态度，何况这种看法和态度完全符合它的利益和目的。
    必须同叛徒划清界线把反修斗争进行到底
    苏联领导人为了进行宣传和避免空手而归，于是要求其他的与会者就十月革命五十周年向他们致以某种敬意或祝贺。但是，靠伟大的社会主义革命和第一个社会主义国家的光荣来进行投机是再也欺骗不了谁的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者背叛了列宁，背叛了五十年前推翻了沙皇制度和建立了苏维埃的人们，他们背叛了两千万苏联人为保卫祖国和把欧洲从法西斯魔爪中解放出来而流的血。毫无疑问，目前在十月社会主义革命的祖国上空云集的乌云总有一天会消散的。活在苏联人民心中的、写在苏联真正的共产党人的革命战斗旗帜上的伟大的和永垂不朽的列宁和斯大林的思想必将战胜篡夺了党和国家领导的修正主义。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者希望利用他们的卡罗维发利会议，从事蛊惑人心和新的欺骗活动。现在，马克思列宁主义者和各国革命人民都很了解修正主义的战术，他们能够正确地分析各种形势，得出绝对必要的结论。无疑地，在修正主义者策划的新的阴谋面前，他们将进一步加强他们队伍的团结和更有力地进行战斗，以揭露修正主义。
    马克思列宁主义者和所有真正革命者的任务就是彻底地同修正主义叛徒们划清界线。这些修正主义叛徒由于他们的背叛和阴谋活动，已经把自己置于反帝阵线之外，置于国际共产主义运动之外。
    文章最后说，在修正主义泛滥的欧洲，目前能够领导反对帝国主义、资产阶级和机会主义的阶级斗争的革命力量是马克思列宁主义者。未来是属于他们的。他们以未来的名义，以革命和社会主义的名义，应该团结一切力量，坚决地同帝国主义及其走卒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者进行斗争。
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命刚开始的时候，列宁勇敢地摆脱了俄国的机会主义的社会党人和第二国际叛徒，并同他们进行了最勇敢的和最坚决的斗争。这一重要革命措施是革命取得胜利的根本条件之一和保证。我们要永远重视这一伟大的历史教训。
    为了使革命取得胜利，我们必须全力地、坚决地和毫不犹疑地同国际共产主义运动的主要危险现代修正主义斗争到底。
