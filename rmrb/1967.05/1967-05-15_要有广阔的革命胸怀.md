	We Must Have a Broad Revolutionary Spirit
	Meng Xianqiang, Leader of the Wind and Thunder Workers' Rebel Corps, Jinan City Fifth Shoe Production Cooperative

	Whether or not one can correctly handle the masses who have been deceived is a crucial issue in implementing the revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In our efforts to unite the majority, the Wind and Thunder Workers' Rebel Corps encountered this problem.

	Where there is unity, there will be struggle. This struggle comes from two sides: one is between the proletarian revolutionary faction and the conservative organizations, and the other is within the proletarian revolutionary faction itself. Within our own ranks, some comrades believed: "They persecuted us so much in the past, now it's our turn to give them a hard time." To win over more people to join the revolution, we seized upon this active thought and immediately organized a study session on Chairman Mao's teachings: "Only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself." Through study, some comrades raised their consciousness, unified their thinking, and corrected their attitudes. They said: "The majority of the deceived masses come from good backgrounds, and after liberation, they stood up. They are our class brothers. Despite their various shortcomings, they are victims of the capitalist roaders within the Party. The account should be settled with the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; we must not retaliate against our class brothers. The original idea of giving them a hard time was driven by selfishness, and we must eliminate this selfishness."

	Therefore, we resolutely followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "It is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance." With deep class feelings, we actively sought them out for individual talks, awakening their class consciousness. A worker Party member, poisoned by the "Cultivation of the Self," regarded the Party branch secretary as the embodiment of the Party and, in the movement, did not dare to rebel, vigorously defending this and that. Our revolutionary comrades actively talked to him, helping him recognize his mistakes. After his consciousness was raised, he actively made a self-criticism and exposed the harm done by the number one capitalist-roader within the Party's advocacy of the "tame tool" theory. He then applied to join our Wind and Thunder Workers' Rebel Corps.

	We also realized: the majority of the deceived masses love the Party and Chairman Mao, but some cannot distinguish between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the capitalist reactionary line. For this reason, we consciously collected materials on the crimes of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party, showed them to the masses, and together criticized the capitalist reactionary line. We studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and relevant editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily," and held discussions together. This played an important role in awakening their consciousness.

	Through this in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, the majority of the deceived masses quickly returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. At this time, some comrades deeply felt: "If we had followed the original idea, just wanting to give them a hard time without educating and uniting them, we would have pushed them to the enemy's side. This would not only fail to isolate the enemy to the greatest extent but would actually strengthen the enemy. We almost fell into the enemy's trap."

	I deeply feel that the proletarian revolutionary faction must not only fiercely strike down the handful but also bravely unite the majority. The proletarian revolutionary faction should have such revolutionary spirit and revolutionary breadth.

    要有广阔的革命胸怀
    济南市第五制鞋生产合作社  风雷工人造反队负责人   孟宪强
    能不能正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，是能不能贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的一个不可忽视的问题。我们风雷工人造反队，在争取团结大多数的工作中，就碰到了这个问题。
    有团结就会有斗争。这个斗争来自两个方面，一方面是无产阶级革命派和保守组织之间，一方面是无产阶级革命派内部。在我们无产阶级革命派内部，当时有些人就认为：他们过去把我们整得太苦了，现在我们也得狠狠地整他们一下。为了争取团结更多的人一道干革命，我们就抓住这个活思想，立即组织大家学习毛主席的教导：只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。通过学习，有的同志提高了觉悟，统一了认识，端正了态度，他们说：“受蒙蔽的群众绝大部分出身好，解放后才翻身，都是自己的阶级兄弟。尽管他们有这样那样的缺点，但也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，这个账应该记在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的身上，记在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上；对阶级兄弟，绝不能打击报复。原来想把他们狠狠地整一下，这是‘私’字在作怪，一定要打掉这个‘私’字。”
    于是，我们就坚决地按照毛主席的教导：“不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”怀着深厚的阶级感情，主动找他们个别谈心，启发他们的阶级觉悟。一个工人党员，由于中了《修养》的毒，把党支部书记当作党的化身，在运动中不敢起来造反，极力地保这保那。我们革命派战士就主动找他谈心，帮助他认识错误。他在认识提高以后，就主动作了检讨，并控诉了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的“驯服工具”论对他的毒害，接着就申请加入了我们风雷工人造反队。
    我们还体会到：原来受蒙蔽的群众，绝大多数是热爱党、热爱毛主席的，但有些人分不清什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线。为此，我们就有意识地搜集党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶材料，给他们看，同他们一起批判资产阶级反动路线。我们和他们一起学习毛主席有关著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论，一起座谈讨论，这对启发他们的觉悟，起了重要作用。
    通过这番深入细致的思想政治工作，绝大部分受蒙蔽的群众很快就回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来了。这时，有的同志深有感触地说：“如果按照原来的想法干，只想狠狠整他们，而不去教育团结他们，就会把他们推到敌人那边去了，这不仅不能最大限度地孤立敌人，相反的会给敌人增加力量。我们差一点上了阶级敌人的当。”
    我深深体会到，无产阶级革命派不但要狠狠打击一小撮，也要勇于团结大多数。无产阶级革命派应当有这样的革命气概和革命胸怀。
