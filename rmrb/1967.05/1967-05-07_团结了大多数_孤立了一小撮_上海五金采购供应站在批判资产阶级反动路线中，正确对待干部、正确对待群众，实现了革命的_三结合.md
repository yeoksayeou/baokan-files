The Shanghai Metal Procurement and Supply Station, in its criticism of the capitalist reactionary line, correctly handled cadres and correctly handled the masses, achieving the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

A report from our newspaper: During the initial months of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the old Shanghai Municipal Committee dispatched a work team to the Shanghai Metal Procurement and Supply Station, which unconditionally implemented the capitalist reactionary line on cadre issues, advocating "striking down a large group and protecting a small group." They deceived the masses, indiscriminately struggling against cadres, causing more than 30 section-level and above cadres in the entire station to be mostly "sidelined," with more than 20 cadres labeled as "anti-party elements," "rightists," and other such hats. At the same time, they used some cadres to strike down more than 40% of the revolutionary workers in the entire station.

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionaries of this station stood up and seized power, launching a fierce counterattack against the capitalist reactionary line. However, the poison of the capitalist reactionary line on cadre issues had not been completely eradicated. Therefore, when the entire station was preparing to organize a "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, it encountered many ideological obstacles. Many masses were not satisfied with some cadres who had made mistakes, believing that bringing them into the combination would not be able to manage the enterprise well. Some comrades who had been struck down thought that allowing those who had implemented the capitalist reactionary line to lead again was not reassuring, and they could not emotionally overcome this in a short time. Some cadres also had grievances.

	Finding the Root Cause Hindering the "Three-in-One Combination"

After the publication of the articles by the editorial board and investigators of the *Red Flag* magazine and Comrade Chen Boda, the revolutionary workers and cadres of the Shanghai Metal Procurement and Supply Station seriously studied and discussed them, finding the root cause hindering the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Everyone realized that the situation in their unit was similar to that of Tsinghua University; both were harmed by the capitalist reactionary line proposed and implemented by the top capitalist-roader in the Party. To achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," this root must be uprooted. Thus, a mass criticism movement against the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the capitalist reactionary line he represented was launched.

During the criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries consciously guided the broad revolutionary masses to closely link the seizure and holding of power, criticizing the capitalist reactionary line on cadre issues, gradually making everyone see the reactionary nature of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group." They said, the cadre line serves the political line. The top capitalist-roader in the Party and his accomplices struck down a large group, making cadres dare not revolt, causing a serious rift between cadres and the masses, attempting to cover up their tracks and wait for the opportunity to mature for a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. This is a very serious struggle. In the previous period, we were influenced by the capitalist reactionary line, indiscriminately believing that cadres had problems and pushing them all away. This was very detrimental to the proletarian seizure and holding of power.

Is it that we cannot trust the cadres in the station? The broad revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "One must be good at identifying cadres. One must not only look at a cadre's momentary actions but also at the cadre's entire history and entire work." He also said: "One must draw a clear line between two kinds of people: revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries." They linked this to the situation in their unit, using a class perspective to seriously analyze, and more firmly believed in the assessment in the "Twenty-three Articles" personally drafted by Chairman Mao: most cadres are good or relatively good. Some cadres, although they have mistakes and shortcomings, can still be united, educated, and trusted. As for those who had implemented the capitalist reactionary line and suppressed the masses, most were deceived by a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and poisoned by the capitalist reactionary line; as long as they genuinely recognize their mistakes, correct their mistakes, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they can still be trusted.

	Shattering the Spiritual Shackles on Cadres

The process of criticism was, for the broad cadres, a process of deeply touching the soul, putting down the burden, and actively joining the battle. Many cadres at the meeting denounced the harm of the book *Self-Cultivation*. They said, in the past, they often read *Self-Cultivation*, the more they read, the more bourgeois individualism and the less Mao Zedong Thought. Some cadres who had been struck down by the capitalist reactionary line said, due to the influence of *Self-Cultivation*, they were struck down but still "bore the humiliation" and "endured the hardship," hesitating to revolt. Some who had implemented the capitalist reactionary line also said, in the early period of the Cultural Revolution, they followed the fallacies advocated in *Self-Cultivation* such as "organizational discipline" and being the Party's "docile tool," viewing a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party as the embodiment of the Party, becoming their tools to strike down revolutionary masses, and blindly thinking that they had strong organizational discipline. Today, under the great education of Mao Zedong Thought, and with the serious and warm help of the proletarian revolutionaries, they finally shattered the spiritual shackles placed on them by the top capitalist-roader in the Party.

During the criticism, the proletarian revolutionaries mobilized all revolutionary workers and cadres in the station to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, not only solving the problem of correctly handling cadres and correctly handling the masses in terms of understanding, but also, when discussing whether a certain cadre could be combined, they similarly used Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, eliminating emotional barriers. At a meeting, the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Tool Department denounced the crimes of the capitalist reactionary line and sincerely made a self-criticism. A revolutionary worker who had been struck down by him followed, saying: "Trees have roots, and water has sources. The poisonous root of persecuting the masses and cadres is the top capitalist-roader in the Party. We should join hands and together uproot this poisonous root." Now, both of them have been elected into the leading core of the Tool Department, closely united, and shoulder to shoulder in participating in this great criticism battle.

	Testing Cadres in the Storms of Class Struggle

The proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Metal Procurement and Supply Station dared to combine cadres but did not forcefully combine them. They warmly helped and strictly demanded of cadres who had made mistakes. They supported cadres in standing up in the struggle against the top capitalist-roader in the Party and a small handful of revisionists in their unit, standing on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. For individual cadres who had not drawn a clear line with a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, the masses demanded that they seriously examine themselves and continue to deeply touch their souls. Through testing in class struggle, the entire station finally selected a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" leadership team that everyone was satisfied with. Seven revolutionary cadres at the section level and above were elected as members of the revolutionary committee, and other revolutionary cadres were also arranged according to needs, thus uniting the majority of cadres and completely isolating a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

    团结了大多数　孤立了一小撮
    上海五金采购供应站在批判资产阶级反动路线中，正确对待干部、正确对待群众，实现了革命的“三结合”
    本报讯　上海五金采购供应站在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，实现了革命的“三结合”，成立了革命委员会。
    在无产阶级文化大革命开始的头几个月中，旧上海市委派驻上海五金采购供应站的工作队，不折不扣地推行了在干部问题上的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。他们蒙骗群众，不分青红皂白地斗争干部，使全站三十多个科级以上干部大多数“靠边站”，其中有二十多个干部被扣上“反党分子”、“右派分子”等帽子。同时，他们又利用一些干部，打击了全站百分之四十以上的革命职工。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，这个站的无产阶级革命派挺身而出夺了权，并向资产阶级反动路线展开了猛烈的回击。但是，在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线的流毒并没有肃清。所以，当全站酝酿组织“三结合”临时权力机构的时候，遇到了许多思想障碍。不少群众对一些犯过错误的干部，总觉得不称心，认为把他们结合进来不可能把企业管好。有些受过打击的同志认为，让那些执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部再当领导，总是不放心，而且在思想感情上一时扭不过来。有些干部也存在着委屈情绪。
               找到阻碍“三结合”的总根子
    《红旗》杂志第五期的评论员、调查员的文章和戚本禹同志的文章发表后，上海五金采购供应站革命职工和革命干部认真地进行了学习、讨论，找到了阻碍实现革命“三结合”的总根子。大家认识到，本单位的情况和清华大学一样，都是受了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线的害，要想实现革命的“三结合”，必须拔掉这个根子。于是，开展了一场对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他代表的资产阶级反动路线的群众性大批判运动。
    在大批判的过程中，无产阶级革命派有意识地引导广大革命职工，紧紧联系夺权和掌权这个根本问题，批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，使大家逐步看清了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动性。他们说，干部路线是为政治路线服务的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和他的帮凶，打击了一大片，使干部不敢起来革命，使干部和群众严重对立，是企图使自己蒙混过关，等待时机成熟，搞全国性的反革命复辟。这是一场极其严重的斗争。前段时间，我们受了资产阶级反动路线的影响，不分青红皂白，认为干部都有问题，一律把他们推开，这样做对无产阶级夺权和掌权是很不利的。
    是不是对站里的干部都不能放心呢？广大革命职工带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作。”又说：要划清“两种界限：革命和反革命的界限”。他们联系本单位情况，用阶级观点认真分析，更加坚定地相信毛主席亲自主持制订的“二十三条”中的估计：大多数干部是好的和比较好的。有些干部虽有错误缺点，还是可以团结、教育和信赖的。至于那些执行过资产阶级反动路线、压制过群众的干部，多数是受了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的蒙蔽，是中了资产阶级反动路线的毒；只要他们真正认识错误，改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，仍然是可以信赖的。
                打碎干部身上的精神枷锁
    大批判的过程，对广大干部来说，是一个狠触灵魂，放下包袱，积极投入战斗的过程。许多干部在会上控诉《修养》这本书对自己的毒害。他们说，过去经常看《修养》，越看，资产阶级个人主义思想越多，毛泽东思想越少。有些遭到资产阶级反动路线打击的干部说，由于《修养》的影响，自己受到打击，仍然“委曲求全”“忍辱负重”，迟迟不起来革命。有些执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部也说，文化大革命运动初期，自己按照《修养》鼓吹的“组织性纪律性”和所谓做党的“驯服工具”等谬论，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派看作党的化身，做了他们打击革命群众的工具，还盲目地以为组织观念强。今天，在伟大的毛泽东思想教育下，在无产阶级革命派严肃热情的帮助下，才打碎了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派套在自己身上的精神枷锁。
    在大批判的过程中，无产阶级革命派发动全站革命职工和革命干部活学活用毛主席著作，不仅在认识上解决了正确对待干部、正确对待群众的问题，而且在讨论某一个干部能不能结合的时候，同样以毛泽东思想为指南，破私立公，消除了思想感情上的隔阂。在一次大会上，工具科党支部副书记控诉了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，诚恳地作了检查。一个被他打击过的革命职工接着上台说：树有根，水有源，整群众、整干部的毒根就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派。我们应该携起手来，共同挖掉这个毒根。现在，他们两人都被选入工具科的领导核心，紧密团结，并肩参加这场大批判的战斗。
                在阶级斗争风浪中考验干部
    上海五金采购供应站的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，对干部既敢于结合，又不是勉强凑合。他们对犯错误的干部热情帮助，严格要求。他们支持干部在对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和本单位一小撮修正主义分子的斗争中“亮相”，站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。个别干部没有和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，群众就要他认真检查，继续狠触灵魂。通过在阶级斗争中鉴别，全站终于选出了大家满意的革命的“三结合”领导班子。有七名科级以上革命干部被选为革命委员会的成员，对其他革命干部也根据需要分别安排了工作，从而团结了干部大多数，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派完全陷于孤立。
