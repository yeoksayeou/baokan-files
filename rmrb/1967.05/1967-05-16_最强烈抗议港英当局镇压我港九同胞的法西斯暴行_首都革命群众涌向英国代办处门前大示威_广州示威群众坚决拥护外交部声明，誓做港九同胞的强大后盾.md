The fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities in bloodily suppressing our compatriots have infuriated the revolutionary workers, Red Guards, and other revolutionary masses of the capital. Today, they gathered in front of the British Office in China with hearts filled with indignation to protest. The revolutionary masses of the capital expressed their firm support for the most urgent and strongest protest made by our government to the British government. They sternly pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities, in colluding with the U.S. imperialists to recklessly oppose China, are not to be trifled with by the Chinese people armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The people of Beijing and the people of the entire country are the powerful backbone supporting the just struggle of the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong.

Today, the front of the British Office in China became the place where the workers, Red Guards, and other revolutionary masses of the capital gathered to denounce the British imperialists, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. The walls, roads, and everywhere in front of the British Office were covered with big-character posters and banners of protest. The revolutionary masses of the capital, carrying the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, holding high red flags, and shouting slogans, came here to protest. People held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," reading aloud the wise words of Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they have no power at all. From a long-term point of view, the real power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." They sang songs from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," such as "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," expressing their extremely high revolutionary fighting spirit.

The protesting revolutionary masses pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' creation of the bloody incident of suppressing the Chinese workers, representatives of various circles, and students in Hong Kong was a long-planned, organized, and calculated atrocity. It was a mad provocation by the British government against the Chinese people. The British government dared to make an enemy of the seven hundred million Chinese people and act as the U.S. imperialists' running dogs to oppose China. It will surely meet a bad end. A worker from the Beijing First Sanitation Vehicle Factory angrily said, "If the Hong Kong British authorities do not stop their reckless actions, we sanitation workers will fight them to the end." Many workers from the Beijing Food Company rushed to the front of the British Office to protest after work. They said, "We will not allow the Hong Kong British authorities to suppress our compatriots. The powerful socialist China is not to be trifled with. The era of imperialists bullying the Chinese people is gone forever. We firmly support the just struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong and are determined to fight this battle to the end." They angrily shouted, "We will be the powerful backbone of our compatriots in Hong Kong!" "We must demand blood debt from the British authorities!" "The British government must immediately and unconditionally accept the stern demands of the Chinese government!"

Chairman Mao said, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The revolutionary masses of the capital, who have been advancing from victory to victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, angrily denounced the Hong Kong British authorities' attempt to suppress the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, with high-pressure methods out of fear of the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. They said, "The black hand of the Hong Kong British authorities cannot block the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the revolutionary masses of the capital are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory and, together with the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, march forward more vigorously under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought."

Many Red Guards tonight, carrying red flags, holding glue pots, and big brushes, came to the front of the British Office to protest and write big-character slogans. They wrote one after another big-character slogans on the walls of the British Office, such as "Down with British imperialism!" "British imperialism's opposition to China will have no good end!" A revolutionary student from a Beijing middle school said, "The Chinese Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Blood debt must be repaid with blood. We sternly warn the Hong Kong British authorities that if they do not stop their reckless actions, they will surely meet a bad end."

The revolutionary journalists of the Xinhua News Agency Beijing Branch tonight also went to the front of the British Office to strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' bloody suppression of the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and the unreasonable beating of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter by the Hong Kong police. They angrily said, "The Hong Kong British authorities, in colluding with U.S. imperialism to recklessly oppose China, bloodily suppressed the Chinese workers, representatives of various circles, and students in Hong Kong, and beat the Xinhua News Agency reporter Tu Qiang, who was conducting normal reporting activities. This is the British imperialists' provocation against the great Chinese people. The Hong Kong British authorities' arrogant and despicable actions will only 'lift a stone to drop on their own feet.' They expressed their firm support for the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the three stern demands made by the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch to the Hong Kong "Superintendent" Dai Linzhi. They said, "The three stern demands made by the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, including severely punishing the culprits, apologizing to our reporter, and guaranteeing the freedom of news reporting, are very reasonable. The Hong Kong British authorities must fulfill them without any discount!"

The revolutionary masses of the capital highly praised the heroic spirit shown by the compatriots in Hong Kong in their struggle against suppression and expressed their highest respect to the workers, representatives of various circles, and students in Hong Kong who are fighting bravely. The warriors of the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission and the Revolutionary Rebel Brigade of the Institute of International Relations said, "We, the people of the entire country, firmly support our compatriots in Hong Kong. We and the compatriots in Hong Kong are heart to heart. We are determined to be the strong backbone of our compatriots in Hong Kong." The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Radio Equipment Factory, after work, rode bicycles for dozens of miles to the front of the British Office in China to post big-character posters, protesting against the Hong Kong British authorities' atrocities of persecuting Chinese compatriots. They expressed that the Chinese working class and the people of the entire country firmly support the just struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong until victory is achieved.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 15th: Over 40,000 Red Guards and revolutionary workers and cadres from universities and colleges in Guangzhou held a grand rally and demonstration tonight, firmly supporting the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities in bloodily suppressing the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong with a large number of military and police thugs.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards unanimously expressed their determination to be the powerful backbone of the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, firmly fighting the Hong Kong British authorities to the end, and not resting until victory is achieved.

The representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards sternly warned the Hong Kong British authorities that if they dared to make an enemy of the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought and act as the running dogs of U.S. imperialism to oppose China, this would only be lifting a stone to drop on their own feet. We, the proletarian revolutionary factions, mean what we say. The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately accept the five stern demands made by our government. Otherwise, they must bear all the consequences that arise from this!

The representatives of the proletarian revolutionary factions pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' bloody suppression of the workers of the Hong Kong New Chuk Yuen Artificial Plastic Flower Factory and other Chinese residents was a long-planned, organized, and calculated atrocity. It was their attempt, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, to suppress the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and provoke the Chinese people madly. We must warn the British government that the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with! Blood debt must be repaid with blood. Chairman Mao taught us, "Lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet." This is a Chinese saying describing the behavior of some fools. The Hong Kong British authorities are just such a bunch of fools. They will surely meet a bad end.

The Red Guards of Guangzhou said, "We are the little red soldiers of Chairman Mao, the upright proletarian revolutionary factions. We solemnly declare: We most firmly support the brave and just struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong and are determined to be their backbone! We sternly warn the Hong Kong British authorities that your bloody atrocities show that you are extremely afraid of and hate our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and also show your fear and panic of the Hong Kong compatriots armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, who have a high spirit of anti-imperialist struggle. This fully exposes your ugly face as 'paper tigers.' If you dare to make an enemy of the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, we will be determined to fight you to the end."

The meeting passed a telegram of support to the brave compatriots in Hong Kong who are fighting against suppression.

After the meeting, over 40,000 people held a grand demonstration. The warriors of the proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards, holding high the portraits of Chairman Mao and the plaques of Chairman Mao's quotations, angrily raised their arms and shouted, "Strongest protest against the bloody atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Firmly support the just struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong against suppression!" "Down with U.S. and British imperialism!" "The Chinese government and people are determined to fight this battle to the end!"

    首都革命群众涌向英国代办处门前大示威
    广州示威群众坚决拥护外交部声明，誓做港九同胞的强大后盾
    新华社十五日讯　被香港英国当局血腥镇压中国同胞法西斯暴行激怒了的首都革命工人、红卫兵小将和其他革命群众，今天以无比愤慨的心情涌到英国驻中国代办处门前游行示威。首都广大革命群众表示，坚决拥护我国政府向英国政府提出的最紧急最强烈的抗议，并且严正指出：绝不容许香港英国当局勾结美帝猖狂反华，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，首都人民和全国人民是坚决支持香港中国同胞正义斗争的强大后盾。
    今天英国驻华代办处门前，成了首都工人、红卫兵和其他革命群众集中声讨美帝帮凶——英帝国主义的场所。英国代办处的门前，墙上，马路上，到处贴着抗议的大字报和大字标语。首都广大革命群众，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高举红旗，高呼口号，来到这里游行示威。人们捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读毛主席的英明论断：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”高唱“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”等毛主席语录歌曲，表现出无比高昂的革命战斗意志。
    游行示威的革命群众纷纷指出，香港英国当局制造镇压香港中国工人、各界代表和青年学生的血腥事件，完全是它蓄谋已久的、有组织、有计划的暴行，是英国政府对中国人民的疯狂挑衅。英国政府胆敢与七亿中国人民为敌，充当美帝国主义反华打手，是绝没有好下场的。北京市第一清洁车辆厂一位清洁工人愤怒地说，香港英国当局如不悬崖勒马，我们清洁工人就要同它斗争到底。北京市食品公司许多工人，下班后就赶到英国代办处门前示威抗议。他们说，我们决不允许香港英国当局镇压我国同胞。强大的社会主义中国是不好惹的，帝国主义欺侮中国人民的时代一去不复返了。我们坚决支持香港同胞的正义斗争，决心把这场斗争进行到底。他们愤怒地高呼：“誓作香港爱国同胞的强大后盾！”“一定要向英国当局讨还血债！”“英国政府必须立即无条件接受中国政府的严正要求！”
    毛主席说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”在无产阶级文化大革命中不断从胜利走向新的胜利的首都革命群众，怒斥香港英国当局慑于伟大毛泽东思想的无比威力，蓄意制造血腥暴行，妄图以高压手段来抵制毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响。他们说，香港英国当局的这只黑手，遮不住毛泽东思想的阳光。首都无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，决心把无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行到底，同香港中国同胞一道，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进。
    许多红卫兵小将，今晚打着红旗，提着浆糊筒，拿着大刷子，来到英国代办处门口游行示威，刷大标语。他们在英国代办处的墙上刷了一张又一张“打倒英帝国主义”“英帝国主义反华绝没有好下场”的大字标语。北京一个中学的革命学生说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国红卫兵是不好惹的，血债要用血来还。我们严正警告香港英国当局如不悬崖勒马，继续倒行逆施，是决不会有好下场的。
    新华社北京分社的革命新闻工作者，今晚也到英国代办处门前，强烈抗议香港英国当局血腥镇压香港中国同胞和港英警察无理殴打我新华社香港分社记者。他们愤怒地说，香港英国当局勾结美帝国主义猖狂反华，血腥镇压香港的中国工人、各界代表和青年学生，殴打进行正常采访活动的新华社记者司徒强，这是英帝国主义对伟大中国人民的挑衅。港英当局这种不自量力的卑劣行径，只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”。他们表示坚决支持我国外交部的声明，和新华社香港分社全体工作人员向港英“总监”戴麟趾提出的最严重的抗议和三项严正要求。他们说，新华社香港分社全体工作人员提出的严惩凶手；向我记者道歉；保证新闻记者采访自由的三项严正要求，十分合理，港英当局必须不折不扣地兑现！
    首都革命群众高度赞扬香港同胞在抗暴斗争中表现出来的英雄气概，并向进行英勇斗争的香港工人、各界代表和青年学生致以崇高的敬意。北京市科学技术委员会革命造反总部和国际关系研究所革命造反大队的战士说，我们全国人民坚决支持香港同胞，我们和香港同胞心连心，我们誓做香港同胞的坚强后盾。北京广播器材厂的革命职工，下班后成群结队骑着自行车赶了几十里路来到英国驻中国代办处门前贴大字报，抗议香港英国当局迫害中国同胞的暴行。他们表示，中国工人阶级和全国人民坚决支持香港同胞的正义斗争，直到取得胜利。
    新华社广州十五日电　广州大中院校的红卫兵和革命派工人、干部四万多人，今晚举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，坚决拥护我国外交部的声明，最强烈抗议香港英国当局出动大批军警暴徒对香港中国同胞进行血腥镇压的法西斯暴行。
    无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将们一致表示，誓作香港中国同胞的强大后盾，坚决同香港英国当局斗争到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    无产阶级革命派代表、红卫兵小将严正警告香港英国当局，如果胆敢同用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民为敌，充当美帝国主义反华打手，这只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚。我们无产阶级革命派说话是算数的，香港英国当局必须立即接受我国政府提出的五条严正要求。否则，由此产生的一切后果必须由香港英国当局承担！
    无产阶级革命派的代表指出，香港英国当局对香港新蒲岗人造塑胶花工厂工人和其他中国居民进行血腥镇压，这是港英当局蓄谋已久的，有组织、有计划的暴行，是它配合美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华活动，企图封锁和削弱我国无产阶级文化大革命的强大影响，而对中国人民进行的疯狂挑衅。我们要警告英国政府，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的！血债一定要用血来还。毛主席教导我们：“搬起石头打自己的脚”，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。香港英国当局就是这样的一批蠢人。他们决不会有好下场的。
    广州红卫兵代表说：“我们是毛主席的红小兵，是顶天立地的无产阶级革命派，我们庄严宣告：我们最最坚决支持香港我国同胞的英勇、正义的斗争，并且坚决做他们的后盾！我们严正警告香港英国当局，你们一手制造的血腥暴行，说明你们对我国无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要命，恨得要死，也说明你们对用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的具有高度反帝斗争精神的香港同胞的胆怯和惊慌，充分暴露了你们“纸老虎”的丑恶面目。如果你们胆敢同用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民为敌，我们就决心同你们斗争到底。
    大会通过了给正在进行反迫害的英勇斗争的香港爱国同胞的支持电。
    大会结束后，四万多人举行了声势浩大的示威游行。无产阶级革命派战士、红卫兵小将高举毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌，无比愤怒地振臂高呼：“最强烈抗议港英当局的血腥暴行”、“坚决支持香港爱国同胞的反迫害的正义斗争”、“打倒美英帝国主义”、“中国政府和中国人民决心把这场斗争进行到底”。
