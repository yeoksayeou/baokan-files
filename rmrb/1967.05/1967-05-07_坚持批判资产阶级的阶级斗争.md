One year has passed since our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao issued the "May 7th Directive." This year has been a year of great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Through this year of struggle against the bourgeoisie, I have come to further understand that: Chairman Mao's emphasis on learning politics and criticizing the bourgeoisie in the "May 7th Directive" is to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the class enemy, to arm the broad masses of peasants with Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of class struggle. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Zhai Li Brigade in Songzhuang People's Commune, Tong County, have been educated and tempered in the great storms of class struggle during the Socialist Education Movement and the Cultural Revolution.

More than a year ago, the old Beijing Municipal Committee sent people to Zhai Li to reverse the verdicts on class enemies, and the class enemies began to stir. At this time, we poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's works. We followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We persisted in struggle until the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao reorganized the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and then we achieved victory.

This February, the struggle between the two lines in Zhai Li's Cultural Revolution was very sharp. A handful of bad elements incited the uninformed masses to carry out white terror against us revolutionaries. At this critical juncture, we still persisted in struggle. Everyone together recited Chairman Mao's teaching: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties, do not fear sacrifice, and strive for victory." Later, with the support of revolutionary cadres from other units, we again achieved victory. This is all the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Six days ago, our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao received us, members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, on Tiananmen Gate and shook hands with us. When we excitedly shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand, thousand years!" and "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" he smiled benevolently and warmly said, "Thank you!" "Thank you!" Chairman Mao and the broad masses, and we poor and lower-middle peasants are truly heart to heart! In the future, we must read his books more diligently, listen to his words, and act according to his instructions, especially according to his "May 7th Directive," gradually turning this great directive into a great reality, making Zhai Li Brigade into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought for cultivating a new generation.

    坚持批判资产阶级的阶级斗争
    北京市革命委员会常委、通县宋庄公社翟里大队大队长　邓万田
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出的“五·七”指示，已经一周年了。这一年，是无产阶级同资产阶级大决战的一年。通过这一年同资产阶级的较量，使我进一步体会到：毛主席在“五·七”指示中强调的学政治，批判资产阶级，就是要同阶级敌人作你死我活的斗争，就是要在阶级斗争中用毛泽东思想武装广大农民群众。我们翟里大队的贫下中农，在农村四清运动和文化大革命中，是一直在阶级斗争的大风大浪中受教育、受锻炼的。
    一年多以前，旧北京市委派人来到翟里要为阶级敌人翻案，阶级敌人也蠢蠢欲动。这时候，我们贫下中农就学习毛主席著作，我们根据毛主席的“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”的教导，坚持斗争，一直到党中央和毛主席改组了旧北京市委，我们才胜利了。
    今年二月，翟里的文化大革命中的两条路线斗争十分尖锐，一小撮坏人煽动不明真相的群众，对我们革命派实行白色恐怖。在这个危急的关头，我们还是坚持斗争，大家齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”后来，在外单位的无产阶级革命派的支援下，我们又取得了胜利。这都是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    六天以前，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在天安门城楼上接见了我们北京市革命委员会的成员，并和我们握了手。当我们激动地高呼“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”的时候，他老人家慈祥地笑着，亲切地说：“谢谢！”“谢谢！”毛主席他老人家和广大群众，和我们贫下中农真是心连心啊！我们今后一定要更努力地读他老人家的书，听他老人家的话，照他老人家的指示办事，特别要照他老人家的“五·七”指示办事，把这个伟大的指示逐步地变成伟大的现实，把翟里大队办成培养一代新人的毛泽东思想大学校。
