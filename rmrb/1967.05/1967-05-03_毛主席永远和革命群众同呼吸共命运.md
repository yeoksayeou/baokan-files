In the midst of the high tide of revolutionary criticism against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, at the moment when the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of laboring people in our country, together with all revolutionary people of the world, are enthusiastically celebrating the day of unity and struggle for the proletariat and laboring people—the May Day International Labor Day—broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai, with boundless excitement, eagerly watched the large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao Reviews the Cultural Revolution Army for the Fifth and Sixth Times." They once again shared the happiness of being with our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao on the screen, and drew new great inspiration and strength from it. They resolutely declared that they would not let down the great concern of the great leader Chairman Mao for them, and would defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

This film, which truthfully records the great historical fact of the great leader Chairman Mao's enthusiastic support for the revolutionary mass movement at a crucial moment in the struggle between the two lines, began screening in Shanghai on May 1st. When our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao appeared on the screen, dressed in a green military uniform, radiant, and full of vigor, thunderous applause and cheers erupted. The revolutionary masses and the revolutionary youngsters on Tiananmen Square shouted in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

In less than a month, Chairman Mao received the Cultural Revolution Army twice, giving great encouragement and support to the broad revolutionary students and Red Guards. The young revolutionaries of the Shanghai Drama Academy saw on the screen Chairman Mao riding in an open car, waving frequently to the cheering and jumping revolutionary youngsters along the fifty-li-long red road. It was as if they were back to the happiest moment of seeing Chairman Mao on October 18th and November 3rd last year. They were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes. They said with deep affection: Our most beloved and respected Red Commander Chairman Mao, in the days of the most severe white terror, it was you who issued the great call to thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line, which strengthened our confidence, inspired our fighting spirit, helped us overcome the difficulties set by the capitalist reactionary line, and achieved one great victory after another. Today, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has entered the decisive battle stage. We will definitely hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launch a fierce attack on the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and will not rest until we have criticized, overthrown, and exposed them!

The broad revolutionary workers in Shanghai, who have achieved great results in responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," watched this exciting film and became even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. The Hudong Shipyard, which had already overfulfilled its production plan for April, was filled with joy yesterday, with continuous screenings of the film. All the revolutionary workers in the factory decided to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp revolution and promote production, fight for a red May, and achieve double victories in revolution and production!

The firm supporters of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries—the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai—were so moved after watching the film that they couldn't sleep all night. They said, we are the people's children's soldiers created and led by Chairman Mao. We will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works more actively, with one hand holding a gun and the other holding a pen, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all enemies that dare to invade. We will criticize deeply, thoroughly, and expose the capitalist reactionary line represented by the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The soldiers and officers expressed their determination to respond to the great call of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, excellently complete the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and defend Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao to the death!

Revolutionary cadres in government agencies watched the film and resolutely declared that they would hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, follow Chairman Mao closely, dare to "strike a small group" and "liberate a large area," thoroughly eliminate the poison of the capitalist reactionary line, and in the great criticism, further achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 2nd, on the eve of May Day International Labor Day, Hong Kong and Macau simultaneously screened the large-scale documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts—Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China." The broad patriotic compatriots were overjoyed after watching the film, and they once again shared the infinite happiness of seeing the great leader Chairman Mao and drew great inspiration and strength from it.

When the screen showed the brilliant image of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, the audience in the cinema was stirred, and thunderous applause and cheers erupted. Many spectators shouted with the revolutionary masses on the screen: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" The spectators said: Our beloved Chairman Mao is radiant and full of vigor, and his health is our greatest happiness. Chairman Mao walks among the people, sharing the same breath and fate with the revolutionary masses. He loves the people the most, believes in the people the most, and supports the people's revolutionary pioneering spirit the most. Many spectators were so moved that tears welled up in their eyes.

Workers said after watching the film, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, exposing a small group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We saw this film and deeply understood the great significance of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, we workers love you so much. Whenever we think of you, we feel our blood boiling and our bodies full of strength. We will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions.

Groups of young students went to watch the film. A female student excitedly said, when I saw our most beloved leader Chairman Mao coming down from the Tiananmen Gate Tower, walking over the Golden Water Bridge, and going into the crowd, I felt as if Chairman Mao was walking towards us. I couldn't help but stand up from my seat to welcome the Chairman Mao we miss day and night. Classmates expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and learn the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary pioneers, the Red Guards.

In the "December 3rd" anti-imperialist patriotic struggle, the compatriots in Macau, who had achieved brilliant victories by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, collectively studied Chairman Mao's quotations before watching the film and sang enthusiastically about the red sun in our hearts. Whenever the film showed the brilliant image of Chairman Mao, the audience cheered and jumped, holding up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouting, "Long live the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"
