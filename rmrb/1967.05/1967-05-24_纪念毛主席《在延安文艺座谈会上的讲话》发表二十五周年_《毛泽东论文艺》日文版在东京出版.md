The Japanese publishing house, Dongfang Books, has commemorated the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" by vigorously promoting the boundless Mao Zedong Thought in Japan. Recently, they published the Japanese edition of "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art." The translators, renowned Japanese revolutionary scholars Shenchuan Qianci and Andefu Yantao, highly praised the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the preface of this book.

This Japanese edition of "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" is translated from the Chinese edition published by the People's Literature Publishing House.

The cover of this book features a side portrait of Chairman Mao, the great teacher of the world's people. The frontispiece carries the inscription of Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms:

"Study Chairman Mao's works, follow Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

In the preface, the translators pointed out that the experiences of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle led by Chairman Mao have become a precious treasure for revolutionary people all over the world. The great Mao Zedong Thought is an invaluable treasure trove.

The translators wrote: "After the proletariat seizes power, the issues of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, preventing capitalist restoration, and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end are problems that Marxist-Leninists have not yet solved. Mao Zedong Thought has accomplished this task."

The translators pointed out: "The experience of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented feat in human history, and this revolution has written a brilliant chapter in world history. The Mao Zedong Thought that guides the Chinese Cultural Revolution has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Now, studying Mao Zedong Thought is our most important and indispensable task."
