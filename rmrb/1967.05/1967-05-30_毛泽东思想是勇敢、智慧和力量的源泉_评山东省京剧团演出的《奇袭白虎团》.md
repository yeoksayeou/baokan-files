The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" performed by the Shandong Provincial Opera Troupe is a glorious victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a glorious victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Like other revolutionary model operas, the creation, revision, and improvement of "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" have been carried out in the midst of a sharp struggle between the two lines. As early as the 1964 National Modern Beijing Opera Festival, it was once ridiculed by some reactionary academic "authorities" as a "half-martial arts play." A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists from the former Propaganda Department and the former Ministry of Culture did everything they could to strangle this budding socialist art. They shouted that the play should focus on the "surprise attack" and "work on the 'surprise' element," relentlessly injecting poison into "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment." Faced with the rampant sabotage of the class enemy, Comrade Jiang Qing clearly pointed out that "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" is basically a good play. She firmly and enthusiastically encouraged the revolutionary comrades of the troupe to carve it out meticulously and fight this battle well, to stand firm, to fight for the proletariat, and to fight for Chairman Mao! Comrade Jiang Qing's words gave them great encouragement. Over the years, under Comrade Jiang Qing's guidance, they have repeatedly revised and improved the play, using actual actions to counter the attacks of counter-revolutionary revisionists, making "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" a play that has been further improved in both its ideological content and artistic form.

"Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" depicts a battle in which, during the Korean Armistice negotiations in July 1953, our volunteer army, with the assistance of the Korean people, launched a surprise attack on the command headquarters of the U.S.-Rhee puppet "White Tiger Regiment." This play vividly portrays the great historical significance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entering the Korean War. It prominently displays the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's people's war thought and concentrates on summarizing the revolutionary heroic spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win of our People's Volunteer Army. It tells people that no matter how arrogant the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are, they can all be defeated.

The fundamental task of socialist literature and art is to strive to create characters of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao clearly pointed out as early as twenty-five years ago: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to be created for them and to be used by them." The creators of "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" have closely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, through persistent efforts, successfully created the heroic image of our People's Volunteer Army. From the commanders to the soldiers, they are all spirited and full of fighting spirit, showing the revolutionary heroic spirit of overwhelming all enemies. They have a lofty proletarian internationalist spirit, hating the U.S. imperialists to the core, and loving the Korean people dearly. They are the bravest, most resolute, and most intelligent in the struggle against the enemy. They are the people's warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

In the heroic images created in "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment," the reconnaissance platoon leader Yang Weicai is the most vividly and prominently depicted character. This character embodies the common characteristics of our volunteer army heroes and shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao said: The greatest fighting force is the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Yang Weicai is such a person. For example, in the sixth scene, Yang Weicai leads the spearhead company straight into the enemy's command headquarters. During the rapid march, he suddenly steps on a landmine. He stands still calmly, thinking: If the landmine explodes, it will affect our entire combat mission, without considering his personal safety at all. He appoints the platoon leader Zhang Shun to "take over my position if I am martyred." And he encourages the soldiers with the highest directive: "No matter how difficult and arduous the situation is, as long as there is one person left, that person must continue to fight." He instructs everyone: "Even if there are great difficulties, we must complete the glorious mission given by the Party!" After everything is arranged, he begins to defuse the mine. From the actor's agile and vigorous dance movements and his resolute and calm expression, one can see the hero's sublime inner world.

Chairman Mao said: "We must advocate that every Red Army commander becomes a brave and wise hero, not only with the courage to overcome all difficulties but also with the ability to control the entire war's changes and developments." The Yang Weicai depicted in "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" is such a young commander who is both brave and wise. He can apply Chairman Mao's strategic and tactical thoughts flexibly. For example, in the fifth scene, when Commander Wang and Political Commissar Guan ask him where to insert the attack advantageously, Yang Weicai confidently says: "According to our reconnaissance, we will insert from the place where the enemy's deployment is the strongest and the guard is the strictest." Because "this area has many types of troops and complex numbers, which is suitable for our spearhead company to infiltrate in disguise," this is exactly what Chairman Mao teaches us: to find the enemy's weaknesses, attack them unexpectedly, and achieve victory through surprise tactics. After setting out, when they discover that the enemy has laid mines all over this area and it is impossible to advance, Yang Weicai immediately makes a wise judgment: the enemy will not lay mines in the river, so he decides to wade through the water and successfully passes through the minefield. When the reconnaissance platoon reaches the mountain opposite the enemy command post, they suddenly find that the enemy has destroyed the only log bridge. At this critical moment, Yang Weicai's bravery and wisdom are concentrated in a decisive decision: "Fly over the deep ravine to save time," thus ensuring the final victory of the battle.

Where does this great courage and wisdom come from? It comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. Just as the spearhead company sets out, Commander Wang asks them, when defending the "587" hill of Upper Gangling, "the enemy used hundreds of cannons and two battalions of troops to attack you in waves, what did you rely on to defend every inch of land and defeat the enemy?" The soldiers firmly and proudly reply: They rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! The play fully expresses their love for Chairman Mao through the volunteer army's grasp and use of Mao Zedong Thought. "Fear not the mountains of knives and seas of fire, a red heart for the people," "Mao Zedong Thought illuminates my heart, tens of thousands of enemies in one bag." In a word, this play uses artistic images to illustrate a truth: Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of revolutionary people, Mao Zedong Thought is the source of courage, wisdom, and strength, and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the greatest fighting force. An army armed with Mao Zedong Thought is invincible.

To establish the heroic character of Yang Weicai, Comrade Jiang Qing repeatedly emphasized the need to arrange a solo scene for him and to write about his class origins and the process of his growth into a proletarian internationalist soldier under the Party's cultivation and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The creators of "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" followed Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, focusing on depicting Yang Weicai's spiritual appearance and his unlimited loyalty to the Party and the people. In the fourth scene, when Yang Weicai hears the news that the enemy has burned Anpingli and that Aunt Cui has died a heroic death, he cannot help but recall the scene of his mother being killed by the U.S.-KMT bandits, "Two mountains across the sea, two families' bitterness tightly connected." Class hatred and national enmity burn in his heart, turning into a powerful force. This force makes him dare to take the heaviest burden, dare to climb the mountain of knives and cross the sea of fire, and fight bravely for the Party and the people, vividly portraying Yang Weicai's heroic image.

Chairman Mao said: "Our demand is the unity of politics and art, content and form, revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible." In the creation of "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment," they followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "innovating the old and making the past serve the present," transforming and utilizing the ancient Beijing opera art form to serve the revolutionary political content and the creation of worker, peasant, and soldier heroes. They made it a national drama form with a "fresh and lively, popular among the Chinese people, and with a Chinese style and Chinese spirit," making outstanding contributions to the innovation of Beijing opera art.

According to the plot of describing the soldiers' battle life, this play fully utilizes the martial arts skills of Beijing opera to express how our volunteer army soldiers overcame numerous difficulties and successfully completed their combat mission. There are many moving scenes in the play. In the thunderous rainstorm at night, Yang Weicai leads the spearhead company's soldiers along the muddy mountain road straight into the enemy's heart. Along the way, they jump over cliffs, cross barbed wire, climb mountains, wade through water, fly over deep ravines, and finally engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, etc. All these exciting performances are completed with the unique martial arts techniques of Beijing opera. It not only showcases the strengths of Beijing opera martial arts but also fits the reality of battlefield life, vividly portraying the volunteer army soldiers' excellent skills in killing enemies and their brave and tenacious heroic spirit.

"Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" also made some important reforms in the design of singing tunes and musical accompaniment. It removed the passive and decadent elements of old Beijing opera and replaced them with healthy and lively singing methods. On the one hand, it determines the tunes and singing styles based on the characters' thoughts and feelings, and on the other hand, it creatively creates some new tunes with distinct styles. Even in the singing, it absorbs some melodies from new songs and Korean folk songs. For example, in the first scene, the melody of the "Volunteer Army Battle Song" is subtly blended into the last sentence of Yang Weicai's singing of the "Xipi Flowing Water" tune, highlighting the hero's determination to kill the enemy. In terms of musical accompaniment, to express the soldiers' fiery struggle life, it boldly absorbs orchestral music and uses musical accompaniment to match the characters' beautiful postures, creating a good stage atmosphere. These reforms undoubtedly opened up new horizons for the stagnant old Beijing opera art and added endless vitality to the development of new Beijing opera art, enabling it to better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

We must sweep away all feudal, bourgeois, and revisionist literature and art, and we must create a brand new proletarian literature and art. This new literature and art must be used with the greatest enthusiasm to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" sets a good example in this regard.

    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁
    ——纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    毛泽东思想是勇敢、智慧和力量的源泉
    ——评山东省京剧团演出的《奇袭白虎团》
    中国戏曲研究院红旗战斗兵团
    山东省京剧团再次来京演出的革命现代京剧样板戏《奇袭白虎团》，是毛泽东思想的辉煌胜利，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的辉煌胜利！
    象其它的革命样板戏一样，《奇袭白虎团》的创作、加工和提高，也是在两条路线的尖锐斗争中进行的。早在一九六四年全国京剧现代戏会演时，它就曾被一些反动的学术“权威”嗤之为“半出武戏”。旧中宣部、旧文化部的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，也千方百计地想扼杀这棵社会主义文艺的幼苗。他们叫嚷这出戏要以“奇袭为主”，“要在‘奇’字上下功夫”，拚命地往《奇袭白虎团》里灌输毒素。面对着阶级敌人的猖狂破坏，江青同志明确指出，《奇袭白虎团》基本上是好戏，并且坚定而热情地鼓励剧团的革命同志，一定要精雕细刻打好这一仗，要顶得住，为无产阶级争气，为毛主席争气！江青同志的话给了他们极大鼓舞。几年来，他们在江青同志的指导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，反复地加工修改，以实际行动回击了反革命修正主义分子的进攻，使得《奇袭白虎团》这出戏，从思想内容到艺术形式都有了进一步的提高。
    《奇袭白虎团》通过一九五三年七月朝鲜停战谈判期间，我志愿军在朝鲜人民的协助下奇袭美李匪军“白虎团”指挥部的一次战斗，再现了具有伟大历史意义的中国人民志愿军入朝参战的图景。这出戏突出地表现了毛主席人民战争思想的光辉胜利，集中地概括了我人民志愿军敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命英雄主义的精神。它告诉人们：美帝国主义及其走狗无论多么嚣张，但都是可以打败的。
    社会主义文艺的根本任务，就是要努力塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄人物。毛主席早在二十五年前就明确指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”《奇袭白虎团》的创作者们，紧紧遵循毛主席这一教导，经过坚持不懈的努力，成功地塑造了我人民志愿军指战员的英雄群象。他们藐视美李匪帮所谓“王牌军”，从指挥员到战士，个个都是英姿勃勃、斗志昂扬，表现出压倒一切敌人的革命英雄气概。他们具有崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神，对美帝国主义切齿痛恨，对朝鲜人民无比热爱。他们在对敌斗争中最勇敢，最坚决，最聪明，他们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士。
    在《奇袭白虎团》塑造的英雄群象中，侦察排长杨伟才是描绘得最为鲜明和突出的一个。在这个人物身上，集中地体现了我志愿军英雄的共同特点，闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉。
    林彪同志说：最大的战斗力是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人。杨伟才就是这样一个人物。如第六场杨伟才率领尖刀班直插敌人的指挥部，在紧急行军时突然踩到了地雷，他沉着冷静地站住了，这时他想到的是：万一地雷爆炸，就会影响我们整个战斗任务，而对个人安危没有丝毫考虑。他指定班长张顺和，“如果我牺牲了，你代替我的职务。”并且用最高指示鼓励战士们：“不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”嘱咐大家：“就是有天大的困难，也要完成党交给的光荣任务！”一切布置妥当，他才开始排雷。从演员的矫健刚劲的舞蹈动作和坚毅沉着的表情中，可以看出这位英雄崇高的内心世界。
    毛主席说：“我们必须提倡每个红军指挥员变为勇敢而明智的英雄，不但有压倒一切的勇气，而且有驾驭整个战争变化发展的能力。”《奇袭白虎团》所刻划的杨伟才正是这样一个智勇双全的年轻指挥员。他对毛主席的战略战术思想能够活学活用。如第五场，王团长和关政委问他从哪里插入有利，杨伟才胸有成竹地说：“根据我们的侦察，就从这敌人配备最强，戒备最严的地方插入。”因为“这一带兵种多，番号复杂，正适合我们尖刀班化装潜入”，这正是毛主席教导我们的找出敌人的弱点，出其不意，攻其不备，突然袭击，出奇制胜的战略战术。出发后，当他们发现敌人在这一带布满了地雷，已无法前进，杨伟才马上机智地判断，溪水之中，敌人不会埋设地雷，于是决定涉水前进，顺利地通过了雷区。侦察排到达敌指挥所对面的山上时，突然发现，敌人把唯一的独木桥破坏了。这时时间紧迫，杨伟才的勇敢和智慧集中为一个果断的决策：“飞越深涧抢时间”，从而保证了战斗的最后胜利。
    这种大智大勇来源于哪里？来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。正象尖刀班出发前，王团长问他们，坚守上甘岭“五八七”高地时，“敌人用几百门大炮、两个营的兵力，向你们轮番进攻，你们依靠什么寸土不让、打败了敌人？”战士们坚定自豪地回答：依靠伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！戏里就是通过我志愿军指战员对毛泽东思想的掌握和运用，充分地表现了他们对毛主席的无限热爱。“刀山火海何所惧，一片红心为人民”“毛泽东思想把我的心照亮，数万敌兵一袋装。”一句话，这出戏用艺术形象表明一个真理：毛泽东思想是革命人民的灵魂，毛泽东思想是勇敢、智慧和力量的源泉，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力，用毛泽东思想武装起来的军队就无敌于天下。
    为了把杨伟才这个英雄人物树立起来，江青同志曾一再强调要为他安排单场戏，要写出他的英雄品质的阶级根源和在党的培养下，在毛泽东思想哺育下成长为无产阶级国际主义战士的过程。《奇袭白虎团》的创作者们遵照江青同志的指示，着力地描写了杨伟才的精神面貌和他对党对人民的无限忠诚。在第四场，当杨伟才听到敌人火烧安平里，崔大娘壮烈牺牲的消息时，不禁回忆起自己的母亲被美蒋匪帮杀害的情景，“两山迢迢隔大海，两家苦恨紧相连”。阶级仇民族恨在他胸中燃起了熊熊的怒火，变成了一种强大的力量，这种力量使他敢于挑最重的担子，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，为党为人民英勇奋战，生动地刻划出了杨伟才的英雄形象。
    毛主席说：“我们的要求则是政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。”在《奇袭白虎团》的创作中，他们按着毛主席“推陈出新”“古为今用”的教导，把古老的京剧艺术形式加以改造，利用起来，为革命的政治内容、为塑造工农兵英雄形象服务，使之成为具有“新鲜活泼的、为中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风和中国气派”的民族戏剧形式，为京剧艺术的革新做出了出色的贡献。
    根据剧本描写人民战士的战斗生活的需要，这出戏充分运用了京剧的武功技巧，来表现我志愿军战士战胜重重困难，胜利完成了战斗任务。戏里有许多令人感动的场面，在雷声隆隆，风雨交加的夜里，杨伟才率领尖刀班的战士沿着泥泞的山路，直插敌人的心脏。一路上跳悬崖，过铁丝网，登山涉水，飞越深涧以及最后和敌人展开肉搏战等等一系列精彩的表演，都是以京剧特有的武工技术来完成的，它既发挥了京剧武戏的特长，又符合战场生活的实际，从而生动地表现出我志愿军战士杀敌的过硬本领和他们勇敢顽强的英雄气概。
    《奇袭白虎团》在唱腔设计和音乐伴奏上，也进行了一些重要的改革。它剔除了旧京剧中的消极、颓废的成分，代之以健康、爽朗的唱法，一方面根据人物的思想感情来确定板式和唱腔，同时又别具风格地创造了一些新的板式，甚至在唱腔中还吸收了新歌曲和朝鲜民歌的某些曲调。例如第一场杨伟才唱的一段〔西皮流水〕的最后一句，就把《志愿军战歌》的旋律不露痕迹地溶合进去，突出地表现了这个英雄人物杀敌的决心。在音乐伴奏方面，为了表现人民战士火热的斗争生活，大胆地吸收了管弦音乐，并且用音乐伴奏配合人物的优美造型，创造了很好的舞台气氛。这些改革的实践，无疑给僵化了的旧京剧艺术开拓了新的天地，也给新京剧艺术的发展增添了无限的生命力，使它能够更好地为工农兵服务。
    我们要扫除一切封建主义、资产阶级、修正主义的文艺，我们还要创造崭新的无产阶级的新文艺。这个新文艺，一定要用最大的热情来宣传毛泽东思想。革命现代京剧《奇袭白虎团》，在这方面给我们树立了一个好样板。
