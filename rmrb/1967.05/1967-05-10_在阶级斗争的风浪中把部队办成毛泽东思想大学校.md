One year has passed since our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school. Over the past year, the troops of the Guizhou Military Region have, amidst the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, repeatedly studied and resolutely carried out this great directive. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously stressed proletarian politics, taken the struggle between the two lines as the key link, and in the great storms of class struggle, have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in practice, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois ideas and lines of military construction, and firmly established Chairman Mao's ideas and lines of military construction. They have carried forward the glorious tradition of our army being both a fighting force and a work force and a production force, actively participated in and defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and bravely undertaken the new and historic tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. They have achieved new successes, established deep proletarian feelings of fish-in-water and flesh-and-blood unity with the revolutionary masses, and further strengthened military-civilian unity. At the same time, the troops have been greatly tempered and raised, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops, and cultivating and training a batch of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Through one year of practice, we deeply feel that Chairman Mao's great directive is a milestone development of Marxism-Leninism, a grand blueprint and eternal guiding principle for the construction of our army, and a fundamental guarantee for our army to forever maintain its people's army character, forever unite with the masses, and forever stand unshakable.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and approaching the workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best and most lively classroom for us to run a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, opening up a broad horizon for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice. A thousand-li horse cannot be found in a garden, and a thousand-year pine cannot grow in a flowerpot. Successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause can only be tempered and grown in the great storms of class struggle and mass struggle. Mao Zedong Thought can only be truly mastered in struggle. In the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we took Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, conducted positive education on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution for the troops, and organized the troops to learn in practical struggles. Especially after Chairman Mao decided that the People's Liberation Army should intervene in local Great Proletarian Cultural Revolutions and carry out the tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers were all elated and unanimously believed that this was a good opportunity to temper themselves in the great storms. They eagerly left their offices and barracks, went deep into factories, rural areas, and schools, and together with revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary youngsters, criticized the bourgeois reactionary line and seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Once they came into contact with the masses, they encountered many new problems that required immediate answers. Many comrades forgot to eat and sleep, seeking answers in Chairman Mao's works. Many comrades said: "At this time, studying Chairman Mao's works feels especially intimate and the understanding is especially profound." "In the great storms, without studying Chairman Mao's works, one would lose direction and be unable to move an inch." Some comrades, in recognizing leftist organizations, deviated from the key link of the struggle between the two lines, and thus saw more family background, less grand direction; saw more minor issues, less main issues; saw more phenomena, less essence. They studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," and "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," took the struggle between the two lines as the key link, used the method of class analysis to investigate and study various factions, corrected their stand, and overcame conservative ideas. Everyone deeply felt: "Studying Chairman Mao's works in struggle is completely different from studying in the barracks," "received the most profound and vivid education of Mao Zedong Thought," "truly a political class without exams."

Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teaching, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, humbly learned from the masses, and willingly became students of the masses. We had extensive contact with the revolutionary masses and personally felt that the broad revolutionary masses had many excellent qualities worth learning from. They had boundless love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao; they had deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, studied them best, and applied them most actively; they had the daring spirit of daring to think, speak, do, pioneer, and revolution; they were full of vigor and had strong fighting spirit, were the least conservative, and accepted new things the fastest. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers, in fighting, living, and learning together with the revolutionary masses, established deep class feelings. From not understanding to enthusiastically praising the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary youngsters, from criticizing to humbly learning. In the process of learning from the revolutionary masses, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers further raised their understanding of the importance and necessity of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, deepened their understanding of the essence of the struggle between the two lines, and had an even deeper love for Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and an even deeper hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, both regarded themselves as a force for the revolution and an object of the revolution, fiercely struggled against selfish thoughts, carried out a revolution in the depths of their souls, and fiercely seized the power of the "self" in their minds, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops.

The surging mass movement has greatly inspired and educated the army, becoming a revolutionary crucible for tempering and raising the army's political awareness. Practice has proven that the vast mass revolutionary struggles themselves are a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought. As long as one goes to the masses, stays with the masses, and studies and applies Chairman Mao's works in practice in the great storms, one will definitely accelerate the construction of the troops to be highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready. Over the past year, the spiritual face of the troops of the Guizhou Military Region has greatly changed. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have been tempered in the fierce class struggles, their stand is firm, their banner is clear, they resolutely execute and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, good deeds and models emerge in layers, and model figures emerge in large numbers. They are all new people of communism nurtured under the care of Mao Zedong Thought, good sons of the people, and good soldiers trained by the great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's great directive that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school" is a new development of our great leader's military thought in the new stage of socialist revolution, proposing higher and newer requirements for our army's mass work. Over the past year, the troops of the Guizhou Military Region, following Chairman Mao's teaching, have carried out mass work more extensively and frequently. All troops have established mass work contact points with local communes, factories, and mines, forming a new situation where everyone does mass work and everyone propagates Mao Zedong Thought, pushing mass work into a new stage.

Using Mao Zedong Thought to propagate to the masses, organize the masses, and arm the masses is the fundamental task of mass work. In mass work, all troops have resolutely overcome the tendency to emphasize manpower and material support while neglecting political and ideological support, vigorously stressed politics, and put supporting the masses with Mao Zedong Thought in the first place. Throughout the region, from headquarters to companies, Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams have been organized, and through various forms, Mao Zedong Thought has been extensively and deeply propagated to the people, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has been propagated, and Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have been propagated. Wherever the propaganda teams went, there was joy and excitement, and the revolutionary masses enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" Many people were so moved that they had tears in their eyes, and universally reflected: "You came just in time, it's great, you brought us Chairman Mao's voice"; "After listening to your propaganda, we have clarified the direction and added boundless strength."

The cadres and soldiers participating in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, as soon as they arrived in the local areas, propagated to the masses the great significance of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, mobilized and organized the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, introduced the army's experience in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, helped them use Mao Zedong Thought to answer and solve various problems in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, helped the masses establish study organizations, and established the system of daily reading. They also, together with the revolutionary masses, "exposed their targets" and held lectures on the use of Chairman Mao's works. Many comrades also spread Mao Zedong Thought with their model actions. They practiced the "four firsts" and the "three-eighths" style with their actual actions, setting an example everywhere. Under the influence of the model actions of the army's cadres and soldiers, the broad revolutionary masses loved Chairman Mao even more and loved Mao Zedong Thought even more. They universally reflected: The PLA's every action and deed shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. We must be like the PLA and study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice.

Over the past year, the troops of the Guizhou Military Region, following Chairman Mao's directive that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school," have been tempered in the storms of class struggle, greatly raising the troops' class consciousness and political and ideological work level. The army loves the people, and the people support the army. The army and the people have united more closely under the boundless banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We will raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, and in the surging class struggles and mass struggles, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, making the troops, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought, even better.

    在阶级斗争的风浪中把部队办成毛泽东思想大学校
    中国人民解放军贵州省军区政治部
    伟大领袖毛主席发出“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大号召一周年了。一年来，贵州省军区部队在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争中，反复学习和坚决贯彻了这一伟大指示。广大指战员更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，以两条路线斗争为纲，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，大破资产阶级建军思想、建军路线，大立毛主席的建军思想、建军路线，发扬了我军既是战斗队，又是工作队、生产队的光荣传统，积极参加和保卫了无产阶级文化大革命，勇敢地担负了支左、支工、支农、军管、军训这一崭新的具有伟大历史意义的任务，作出了新的成绩，同无产阶级革命派建立了鱼水不分、血肉相联的深厚的无产阶级感情，进一步加强了军民团结。同时，也使部队得到了很大的锻炼和提高，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了一个新阶段，促进了部队的思想革命化，培养和造就了一批无产阶级革命事业接班人。在一年的实践中，我们深刻体会到：毛主席这一伟大指示是对马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，是我军建设的宏伟纲领和永恒指针，是使我军永远保持人民军队本色，永远和人民群众打成一片，永远立于不败之地的根本保证。
    毛主席教导我们说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命是我们办好毛泽东思想大学校的最好最活的大课堂，为活学活用毛主席著作开辟了广阔的天地。庭园里溜不出千里马，花盆里长不出万年松。无产阶级革命事业接班人只有在阶级斗争和群众斗争的大风浪中，才能锻炼成长，毛泽东思想只有在斗争中才能真正学到手。无产阶级文化大革命初期，我们就以毛主席著作为基本教材，向部队进行无产阶级文化大革命的正面教育，注意组织部队到斗争实践中学习。特别是毛主席决定人民解放军介入地方无产阶级文化大革命，执行支左、支工、支农、军管、军训任务以后，广大指战员无不欢欣鼓舞，一致认为，这是到大风大浪中去锻炼的好机会，纷纷走出机关，走出营房，深入到厂矿、农村、学校，和革命职工、革命干部、贫下中农、革命小将一起批判资产阶级反动路线，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。他们一接触群众，就遇到许多新的问题，要求作出迅速回答。许多同志废寝忘食，到毛主席著作中寻求答案。不少同志说：“这个时候学习毛主席著作感到特别亲切，领会特别深刻。”“在大风大浪中，不学习毛主席著作，就会迷失方向，寸步难行。”有些同志在识别左派组织中，离开了两条路线斗争这个纲，因而看出身成分多，看大方向少；看支流多，看主流少；看现象多，看本质少。他们学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》等光辉著作，以两条路线斗争为纲，用阶级分析的方法，对各派组织进行调查研究，端正了立场，克服了保守思想。大家深切体会到：“在斗争中学习毛主席著作，和在营房里学大不一样”，“受到了最深刻、最生动的毛泽东思想的教育”，“真是不上课的政治课，不考试的考试。”
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，广大指战员遵照毛主席的这一教导，相信群众，依靠群众，虚心向群众学习，甘当群众小学生，拜群众为师。我们同革命群众广泛接触，亲身体会到广大革命群众有许多优点值得我们学习。他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚，无限崇拜；他们对毛主席著作怀有深厚的阶级感情，学得最好，用得最活；他们具有敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢于革命的大无畏精神；他们朝气蓬勃，斗志旺盛，最少保守，接受新事物最快。广大指战员在同无产阶级革命派共同战斗、共同生活、共同学习中，建立了深厚的阶级感情。对革命小将的革命行动，由不理解，到热情赞扬；由评头品足，到虚心学习。在向无产阶级革命派学习过程中，广大指战员进一步提高了对无产阶级文化大革命的重要性和必要性的认识，加深了对两条路线斗争实质的理解，对毛主席和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加热爱，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派更加恨之入骨。
    广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命中，既把自己当作革命的一份力量，又把自己当作革命的对象，狠斗私心杂念，在灵魂深处闹革命，狠夺头脑中“私”字的权，促进了部队的思想革命化。
    汹涌澎湃的群众运动，又总是翻过来大大鼓舞和教育了军队，成为锻炼和提高军队政治觉悟的革命熔炉。实践证明，广阔的群众革命斗争的本身就是学习毛泽东思想的大学校。只要到群众中去，和群众在一起，在大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，就一定能够加速部队非常无产阶级化，非常战斗化的建设。一年来，贵州省军区部队的精神面貌大大改变，广大指战员在激烈的阶级斗争中经受了考验，他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决执行和捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，好人好事层出不穷，模范人物大量涌现。他们都是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的一心为公的共产主义新人，是人民的好儿子，是毛泽东思想大学校培养出来的毛主席的好战士。
    毛主席关于“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大指示，是我们伟大领袖的建军思想在社会主义革命新阶段的新发展，对我军的群众工作提出了更高、更新的要求。一年来，贵州省军区部队遵照毛主席的教导，更广泛，更经常地开展了群众工作。各部队都和驻地社队、厂矿建立了群众工作联系点，形成了一个人人做群众工作，个个宣传毛泽东思想的新局面，使群众工作进入了一个新阶段。
    用毛泽东思想宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众，是群众工作的根本任务。各部队在群众工作中坚决克服了偏重人力、物质支援，轻视政治思想支援的倾向，大力突出政治，把用毛泽东思想对群众的支援摆到了首位。全区部队从机关到连队，都组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，通过各种形式，向人民群众广泛深入地宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，宣传毛主席和党中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的方针政策。宣传队所到之处，一片欢腾，群情振奋，革命群众激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”许多人感动得热泪盈眶，普遍反映：“你们来得太及时了，太好了，给我们传来了毛主席的声音”；“听了你们的宣传，使我们明确了方向，给我们增添了无穷的力量”。
    参加支左、支工、支农、军管、军训工作的指战员，一到地方就向群众宣传活学活用毛主席著作的伟大意义，发动和组织群众活学活用毛主席著作，介绍部队活学活用毛主席著作的经验，帮助他们用毛泽东思想来回答和解决无产阶级文化大革命中的各种问题，帮助群众健全学习组织，建立天天读的制度，并且和革命群众一起“亮靶子”，一起开讲用会。许多同志还以自己的模范行动传播毛泽东思想。他们以实际行动传“四个第一”，带“三八作风”，处处做好样子。在部队指战员模范行动的影响下，广大革命群众更加热爱毛主席，更加热爱毛泽东思想，他们普遍反映：解放军身上处处事事闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉，一定要象解放军那样，活学活用毛主席著作。
    一年来，贵州省军区部队遵循毛主席“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的指示，在阶级斗争风浪中得到了锻炼，部队的阶级觉悟和政治思想工作水平大大提高了一步。军爱民，民拥军，军队和人民群众在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的旗帜下，更加紧密地团结了起来。我们将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着毛主席指示的方向，在波澜壮阔的阶级斗争和群众斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把部队这个毛泽东思想的大学校办得好上加好。　　（新华社）
