The proletarian revolutionaries in China are seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This has frightened the Soviet revisionist clique!

The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist clique, *Pravda*, deliberately distorts facts and spreads rumors to deceive the Soviet people, falsely claiming that the Chinese people are rebelling against the Communist Party and seizing power from it. We must expose this trick of theirs!

We proletarian revolutionaries love the Communist Party of China, which is guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We resolutely defend the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao. However, we must rebel against the traitors who have infiltrated the Communist Party of China, wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism but acting as revisionists. We must seize back the power they have usurped!

We proletarian revolutionaries love our great socialist motherland, a dictatorship of the proletariat. We vow to defend our socialist state with our blood and lives, ensuring it remains unchanged for generations to come. However, we must seize back the power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who support the Soviet revisionists!

The Soviet revisionist traitors have stolen the name of the Communist Party founded by Lenin, usurped the leadership of the Party and the state in the Soviet Union, and turned the dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Now, they dare to appear in the guise of defending the "leadership of the Communist Party" to attack the Chinese people and deceive the Soviet people. This is truly shameless!

Chairman Mao teaches us that in the socialist stage of history, classes, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, wearing the cloak of Communist Party members, waving the banner of socialism, and shouting Marxist-Leninist slogans, are actually engaged in restoring capitalism. We must rebel against such dangerous elements and seize their power! Otherwise, the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, won by countless revolutionary fighters with their blood and lives, will be in danger of being lost. The historical fact that the Soviet power built by Lenin and Stalin was usurped by Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin is a painful lesson that the revolutionary people of the world must never forget!

In fact, China's Khrushchev and the Soviet Union's Khrushchev are birds of a feather.

The Soviet Khrushchev opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocates the "state of the whole people," and tries to erase the classes and class struggles in socialist society. Under the banner of building communism, they implemented a profit-oriented "new system" in the Soviet national economy, fully restoring capitalism. China's Khrushchev also advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle, trying to cover up class struggles, and even shamelessly advocates the theory of "exploitation is meritorious" for capitalists. How can we not rebel against and seize the power of such a handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party and the state?

The Soviet Khrushchev advocates the infamous "party of the whole people," erasing the class nature of the Party. China's Khrushchev absurdly claims that capitalists and untransformed bourgeois intellectuals can join the Communist Party. Shouldn't we rebel against such a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements who have stolen the leadership positions of the Party?

The Soviet Khrushchev, bowing to the pressure of imperialism, vigorously advocates "peaceful coexistence," "peaceful transition," and "peaceful competition," promoting the infamous "three-no" world, colluding with American imperialism, and betraying the interests of oppressed nations and revolutionary people around the world, completely betraying the principles of proletarian internationalism. China's Khrushchev also follows the footsteps of the Soviet revisionists, advocating that imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries should be accommodated, and that support for the revolutionary people of the world should be reduced. This handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists have not a trace of proletarian internationalism. Shouldn't we overthrow such a handful of traitors to Marxism-Leninism and international proletariat?

The issue is clear: if we do not resolutely remove the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, then, as Chairman Mao warned us, "in a few years or a decade, or in several decades, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration... the whole of China will change color." Our proletarian revolutionaries' struggle to seize power is excellent! The wailing of a handful of Soviet revisionist traitors for the handful of capitalist-roaders within our Party proves that we are seizing power correctly and well!

The Soviet revisionist leadership has usurped power in the Soviet Union, completely leading the great Soviet Union down the path of fully restoring capitalism. You are most afraid that the broad masses of the Soviet people will follow the example of the Chinese people to rebel against you, seize your power, and overthrow your counter-revolutionary rule. Therefore, you are both fearful and hateful, just like China's Khrushchev, desperately opposing our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and maliciously cursing our proletarian revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." The glorious revolutionary tradition of the Soviet people will certainly lead them to draw this lesson from their own experiences: the reason the Soviet revolution suffered a setback is that the proletarian helm was seized by the bourgeoisie; the Soviet revisionist leadership oppresses the Soviet people precisely because they still hold the "power." The great Soviet people will never tolerate the revisionist rule of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The proletariat and revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will draw great inspiration from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, rise up to rebel against the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, seize their power, and plant the banner of Leninism back on the top of the Kremlin!

    我们就是要夺修正主义分子把持的权
    山东省财政厅革命造反指挥部
    我国无产阶级革命派夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，把苏修领导集团吓坏了！
    苏修集团的喉舌《真理报》，为了蒙骗苏联人民，故意歪曲事实，散布谣言，胡说什么中国人民是在造共产党的反，夺共产党的权。我们要揭穿你们的这一套鬼把戏！
    我们无产阶级革命派最最热爱以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指针的中国共产党，我们坚决捍卫以毛主席为首的党中央。但是对你们所支持的混进中国共产党内挂着马列主义之名、行着修正主义之实的叛徒，我们非反不可！
    我们无产阶级革命派最最热爱我们伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义祖国，誓以鲜血和生命来保卫我们的社会主义江山，使她千秋万代，永不变色！但是对你们所支持的钻进我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所窃踞的一切权力，非夺不可！
    苏修叛徒们盗用了列宁缔造的苏联共产党的名义，篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。你们现在居然以维护“共产党的领导”的姿态出现，来攻击中国人民，欺骗苏联人民，这真是不知人间有羞耻事！
    毛主席教导我们：在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，披着共产党员的外衣，打着社会主义的旗号，喊着马列主义的口号，可是干的是复辟资本主义的勾当。对这样的危险人物，我们就要造他们的反，夺他们的权！否则，千千万万无产阶级革命战士用鲜血和生命换来的无产阶级专政的政权，就有丧失的危险。列宁、斯大林缔造的苏维埃政权被赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流篡夺的历史事实，就是全世界革命人民永远不能忘记的沉痛教训！
    其实，中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏联的赫鲁晓夫，是一丘之貉。
    苏联的赫鲁晓夫，反对无产阶级专政，宣扬“全民国家”，极力抹煞社会主义社会的阶级和阶级斗争；他们打着建设共产主义的旗号，在苏联国民经济中推行了一套利润挂帅的所谓“新体制”，全面复辟了资本主义。而中国的赫鲁晓夫也同样鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，极力掩盖阶级斗争，甚至肆无忌惮地给资本家炮制“剥削有功”论。象这样一小撮钻进党和国家内部来的资产阶级代表人物，我们能不造他们的反，能不夺他们的权吗？
    苏联的赫鲁晓夫提倡臭名远扬的“全民党”，抹煞党的阶级性。而中国的赫鲁晓夫胡说什么资本家和没有改造好的资产阶级知识分子，也可以加入共产党。这样的一小撮窃取党的领导职位的反革命修正主义分子，难道不应该造他们的反吗？
    苏联的赫鲁晓夫屈服于帝国主义的压力，极力鼓吹“和平共处”、“和平过渡”、“和平竞赛”，宣扬臭名远扬的所谓“三无”世界，同美帝国主义穿一条连裆裤，出卖被压迫民族和世界革命人民的利益，完全背叛了无产阶级国际主义准则。而中国的赫鲁晓夫也紧步苏修的后尘，主张什么对帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派要和，对世界革命人民的支援要少。这一小撮反革命修正主义分子，那里有一丝一毫无产阶级国际主义的气味，对这样一小撮马克思列宁主义的叛徒、国际无产阶级的叛徒，难道不应该打倒吗？
    问题就是这样明摆着的，如果我们不坚决清除党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就必然要象毛主席所告诫我们的那样：“少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟……整个中国就要改变颜色了。”我们无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争，就是好得很！苏修一小撮叛徒为我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派哭丧嚎叫，证明我们夺权夺得对，夺得好！
    苏修领导集团窃踞了苏联的政权，已经把伟大的苏联完全引向了全面复辟资本主义的道路。你们最害怕广大苏联人民效法中国人民起来造你们的反，夺你们的权，推翻你们的反革命统治，所以，你们又怕又恨，同中国的赫鲁晓夫一样，拚命地反对我国无产阶级文化大革命，恶毒地咒骂我们无产阶级革命派。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民，一定会从自己的亲身经历中，得到这样的教训：苏联革命之所以受到挫折，不是别的，正是无产阶级的印把子被资产阶级夺去了；苏修领导集团之所以这样欺压苏联人民，就是因为他们还掌着“权”。伟大的苏联人民决不会容忍苏修叛徒集团的修正主义统治。苏联的无产阶级和革命人民，从中国无产阶级文化大革命中，将得到伟大的启示，从而起来大造苏修领导集团的反，夺他们的权。伟大的苏联人民必将把列宁主义的革命大旗，重新插上克里姆林宫的上空！
