The book "Self-Cultivation" by the top capitalist-roader within the Party is a poisonous weed. It avoids discussing the fundamental issue of revolution, which is the question of state power, and it avoids discussing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Instead, it vigorously promotes bourgeois selfishness and creates theoretical justifications for individualism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose it, and throw it into the garbage heap.

In "Self-Cultivation," the top capitalist-roader within the Party repeatedly emphasizes the need to "develop oneself," claiming that the Party allows its members, within the bounds of not harming the Party's interests, to "develop their individual personalities and talents." This is actually a promotion of bourgeois individualism.

On the surface, he talks about the "interests of the Party" and the "interests of the revolution," but these are all deceitful lies. What "Self-Cultivation" truly promotes is not the collectivism of "putting the Party's interests first," but rather the extreme individualism of "selfishness first" and "self-centeredness." It encourages Party members to abandon struggle and revolution, to pursue personal development, and to seek "personal and family" happiness. This is a blatant attempt to build a fortress for bourgeois individualism, making it legitimate.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should be done for the people's interests, not for the interests of individuals or small groups," and "Communist Party members should never put personal interests first, but should always subordinate personal interests to the interests of the nation and the people." The broad revolutionary masses of Daqing have followed Chairman Mao's teachings. During the three years of natural disasters and temporary economic difficulties in our country, imperialism blockaded us, and Khrushchev's revisionism strangled us, attempting to overthrow our regime. We oil workers responded to Chairman Mao's great call, coming from all over the country to participate in the Daqing oil field battle. At that time, there was nothing here but a vast sky and a barren plain. Life was hard, and working conditions were poor. But we had only one goal: to bring glory to Chairman Mao and to make the nation proud. Personal interests and family happiness were all thrown to the wind. We worked tirelessly to remove the label of "backward oil industry" and to change the face of our poverty-stricken country. After several years of hard work, we successfully developed a world-class oil field. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

At this very time, the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries internationally were fiercely attacking China, and the ghosts and snakes within the country were all coming out. The top capitalist-roader within the Party, in response to the domestic and international class enemies, once again threw out the poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation." This counter-revolutionary current also had an impact in Daqing. A small group of bad elements talked about personal happiness, saying things like "an eighth-level worker is not as good as a bunch of green onions" and "workers are not as good as farmers," inciting workers to leave the oil field and return to the countryside to establish so-called happy family lives. They attempted to disintegrate our working-class ranks and sabotage the construction of the Daqing oil field. But the working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly rejected this nonsense. We fought against the heavens, the earth, and the class enemies; we did not seek fame or profit, we were not afraid of hardship or death, and we dedicated ourselves to the revolution. We resolutely repelled this evil wind and achieved a great victory. It is clear that if we had followed the ghostly talk in "Self-Cultivation," our oil forces would have disbanded, our oil field would never have been developed, the label of "backward oil industry" would have been worn forever, and we would have been led by the nose by Khrushchev's revisionism.

Chairman Mao calls on us to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements, to break down selfishness and establish public spirit. But the top capitalist-roader within the Party sings the opposite tune, vigorously promoting individualism and creating theoretical justifications for it. We, the working class, must drive the "selfish" element out the door and let Mao Zedong Thought take root in our minds. Whoever defends individualism and acts as its advocate, we will resolutely knock them down and stomp on them, ensuring they never rise again!

    《修养》作者是个人主义的吹鼓手
    张洪池
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》一书，是一棵大毒草。它闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政，竭力鼓吹资产阶级利己主义，为个人主义制造理论根据。我们必须把它批深批透，把它扔到垃圾堆里去。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》里，不厌其烦地反复宣传什么“发展自己”，胡说什么：“党允许党员在不违背党的利益的范围内”，“去发展他个人的个性和特长”。这实际上就是提倡资产阶级的个人主义。
    他表面上也说什么：“党的利益”、“革命的利益”，其实都是骗人的鬼话。《修养》真正要提倡的，不是“以党的利益为第一生命”的集体主义，而是“私”字挂帅、“我”字当头的极端个人主义。是要党员放弃斗争，放弃革命，去追求什么个人的发展，追求“个人以至家庭”的幸福生活。这是明目张胆地为资产阶级个人主义修筑防空洞，使它合法化。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”，“共产党员无论何时何地都不应以个人利益放在第一位，而应以个人利益服从于民族的和人民群众的利益。”我们大庆广大革命群众，就是按照毛主席的教导去做的。在我国遭受三年自然灾害、经济暂时困难的时期，帝国主义封锁我们，赫鲁晓夫修正主义卡我们，企图搞垮我们的政权。我们石油工人响应毛主席的伟大号召，来自五湖四海，参加了大庆油田大会战。那时候，这里青天一顶，草原一片，啥也没有，生活艰苦，工作条件很坏。但是我们只有一个心眼：为毛主席争光，为全国人民争气。什么个人利益，什么家庭幸福，统统抛到九霄云外。大家全心全意地为了摘掉石油工业落后的帽子，改变我国一穷二白的面貌而艰苦奋斗。经过几年的奋战，我们硬是拿下了世界第一流的大油田。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    恰恰在这个时期，国际上的帝、修、反疯狂反华，国内的牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，和国内外阶级敌人相呼应，重新抛出大毒草《修养》。这股反革命逆流在大庆也有反映。一小撮坏家伙大讲个人幸福，胡说什么“八级工不如一把葱”、“工不如农”，煽动工人离开油田，回乡建立所谓幸福的家庭生活，企图瓦解我们工人阶级的队伍，破坏大庆油田的建设。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级坚决不听这一套。我们同天斗，同地斗，同阶级敌人斗；不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命，坚决打退了这股妖风，取得了伟大的胜利。事情很明显，如果按照《修养》里那一套鬼话去干，我们的石油队伍就会解散，我们的油田就一辈子也拿不下来，“石油工业落后”的帽子就只能越戴越牢，我们就只能让赫鲁晓夫修正主义牵着鼻子走。
    毛主席号召我们要灭资兴无，破私立公，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却大唱反调，极力提倡个人主义，给个人主义制造理论根据。我们工人阶级一定要把“私”字扫地出门，让毛泽东思想在我们头脑中扎根。谁维护个人主义，充当个人主义的辩护士，我们就坚决把他打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，让他永世不得翻身！
