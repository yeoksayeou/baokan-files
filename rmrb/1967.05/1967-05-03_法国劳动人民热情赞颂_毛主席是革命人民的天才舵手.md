French workers have expressed their boundless respect and love for Chairman Mao in their enthusiastic letters.

An old railway worker wrote twice to pay tribute to Chairman Mao. He wrote, "You belong not only to the Chinese people but also to the people of all countries in the world. The people of all countries in the world place their hope of liberation in you. All true Marxist-Leninists have boundless affection for you. The Soviet revisionist renegades, who collaborate with the class enemy, are sinking deeper and deeper into the mire of betrayal and despicable behavior, and have thus been thrown into the dustbin of history by the people of all countries."

The old worker said, "All true Marxist-Leninists, as well as the proletarians and the poor people of the whole world, will forever stand on your side, holding high the glorious and invincible red flag of world revolution, dyed with the blood of revolutionary heroes."

A young female worker sincerely loves Chairman Mao and strives to study Chairman Mao's works.

She said, "My deep understanding of China, the Chinese Communist Party, and the brilliant thoughts of your great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong... has filled me with enthusiasm and made me more serious in re-engaging in the struggle." She said, Chairman Mao is the "brave and genius helmsman of all true revolutionaries in the world."

The female worker works nine hours a day and insists on studying Chairman Mao's works for one hour after returning home. She has the first and fourth volumes of the French edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and the second and third volumes in English. She said that although she finds it hard to read English, she insists on studying.

She expressed her determination to continue studying Chairman Mao's works unceasingly, to always carry the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with her, and to follow the teachings of Comrade Lin Biao, "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

    法国劳动人民热情赞颂
    毛主席是革命人民的天才舵手
    据新华社巴黎电　法国劳动人民热情洋溢地在他们的来信中表达了对毛主席的无限崇敬和热爱。
    一位老铁路工人两次写信向毛主席致敬。他写道：“您不仅属于中国人民，而且属于世界各国人民。世界各国人民把求得解放的希望寄托在您身上。”“所有的真正的马克思列宁主义者都对您无限爱戴。同阶级敌人合作的苏修叛徒，在背叛和卑鄙无耻行径的泥坑里越陷越深，因此已被各国人民扔进历史的垃圾堆。”
    这位老工人说，“所有真正的马克思列宁主义者，以及全世界的无产者和贫苦人，将永远站在您的一边，把革命英雄的鲜血染红的、不可战胜和光荣的世界革命红旗举得越来越高。”
    一个年青的女工衷心热爱毛主席和努力学习毛主席著作。
    她说：“我对中国、对中国共产党、对你们的伟大革命领袖毛泽东的天才思想的深入了解，……使我满怀热情、更加严肃地重新投入斗争。”她说，毛主席是“全世界所有真正的革命者的英勇的天才舵手”。
    这位女工每天工作九小时，回家后坚持学习毛主席著作一小时。她有《毛泽东选集》法文本第一、四卷，还有英文本的第二、三卷。她说尽管她看英文比较吃力，但仍坚持学习。
    她表示今后要继续不断地学习毛主席著作，要永远随身带着《毛主席语录》，按照林彪同志的教导，“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。”
