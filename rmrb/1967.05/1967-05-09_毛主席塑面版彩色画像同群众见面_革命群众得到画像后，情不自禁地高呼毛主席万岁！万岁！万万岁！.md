Chairman Mao's color portrait with embossed surface meets the masses

Revolutionary masses, upon receiving the portrait, spontaneously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, a new type of Chairman Mao's color portrait with embossed surface was introduced to the revolutionary people of the capital on May 1st, International Labor Day.

This new type of Chairman Mao's color portrait was successfully developed by the revolutionary workers of Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After the news of the release of the embossed surface Chairman Mao's color portrait spread, West Single Commercial Center and People's Road Market were crowded with people, with drums and gongs, accompanied by the festive atmosphere, making the place even more lively. Revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers, with boundless joy, rushed to buy the embossed surface Chairman Mao's color portrait. Those who bought it felt extremely happy. A soldier from the southwestern border region, upon buying a portrait of Chairman Mao in military uniform standing on Tiananmen Gate Tower with his close comrade Comrade Lin Biao, reviewing the great proletarian cultural revolution army, could not help but shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!" A geologist from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, after buying an embossed surface Chairman Mao's color portrait, immediately wrote a letter to his comrades to share his happiness.

There are more than thirty kinds of embossed surface Chairman Mao's color portraits, with the largest being 1.5 meters high and 1 meter wide, and the smallest being 15 centimeters high and 9 centimeters wide. Due to the extremely thin layer of glossy paper on the surface of the portrait, the embossed surface Chairman Mao's color portrait is as smooth and bright as if it were framed with glass, and the colors are more vivid compared to portraits made with ordinary paper.

This new type of color portrait is durable, does not fade, is not affected by humidity, is not damaged by intense sunlight, is not affected by severe vibrations, is not damaged by collisions, and is convenient to carry.

    毛主席塑面版彩色画像同群众见面 
    革命群众得到画像后，情不自禁地高呼毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    据新华社讯　一种新型的塑面版毛主席彩色画像，在“五一”国际劳动节同首都革命人民见面。
    这种新型的毛主席彩色画像是由北京光华木材厂的革命职工在文化大革命中试制成功的。塑面版毛主席彩色画像发行的喜讯传出以后，西单商场和人民路门市部人山人海，敲锣打鼓，伴随着节日的气氛，这里显得格外热闹。革命的工农兵怀着无限喜悦的心情，争先恐后地购买塑面版毛主席彩色画像。那些买到了的人感到无限幸福。一位来自西南边防地区的解放军战士买到一幅毛主席身穿军装和他的亲密战友林彪同志一起站在天安门城楼上，精神焕发地检阅无产阶级文化革命大军的塑面版彩色画像时，情不自禁地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”一位来自青藏高原的勘探队员买到一幅塑面版毛主席彩色画像后，马上写信给他的战友们，让大家分享他的幸福。
    塑面版毛主席彩色挂像共有三十多种，最大的有高一米五、宽一米的，最小的有高十五厘米、宽九厘米的。由于画像的表面有一层极薄的油光纸，制作出来的塑面版毛主席彩色画像，如同镶着玻璃一样平滑明亮，比起用一般纸张制作的毛主席画像，色彩更加鲜艳。
    这种新型彩色画像质地坚固，不褪色，不怕潮湿，不怕烈日暴晒，不怕剧烈震动，不怕碰撞，而且携带轻便。
