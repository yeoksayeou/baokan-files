More than 1,600 people from various circles in Tokyo held a rally on April 29 to express their firm support for Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The stage was adorned with a large portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong and eight banners reading, "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" and "Long Live the Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

Japanese Socialist Party Diet member Okada Haruo, representing the conference presidium, delivered a speech. He said, "The U.S. imperialists, in active collusion with the Soviet revisionists, are invading Vietnam and plan to attack China. This is an attack on the people of the world." Okada further stated, "Strengthening the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China and defeating our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, is the demand of the Japanese people." He emphasized the condemnation of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists for joining the U.S. imperialists' anti-China chorus, saying, "We must further strengthen our unity and resolutely fight against those who wave the 'red flag' but oppose the red flag."

Miyazaki Seiken, chairman of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters, representing the "Committee to Defend the Struggle for the Neighborhood Student Dormitory," spoke. He pointed out that since March, the Japanese people have launched a struggle against the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists for creating anti-China bloodshed, dealing a massive blow to the revisionists. Miyazaki called for a broader and deeper struggle against revisionism to further strengthen the fighting friendship between the peoples of Japan and China.

Fukuda Masayoshi, representing the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (left wing) of the Japanese Communist Party, said, "The victory of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only a victory for the Chinese people but also for the people of the world who are fighting against U.S. imperialism."

He emphasized, "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse. The revolutionary situation in the world and Japan is advancing under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Only Mao Zedong Thought can guarantee the victory of the people of the world."

Kono Minoru, a leader of the Japanese labor movement, said that opposing imperialism and revisionism is our common task. In congratulating the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, he stressed, "As long as we are closely linked with this revolutionary base that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought (Beijing), our struggle will definitely be victorious."

The conference, amid thunderous applause, passed a letter to the Japanese people. The letter called on the Japanese people to oppose the anti-China policies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists, and to work for the success of the second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival.

The letter concluded with the slogans, "Long Live the Fighting Friendship of the 800 Million People of Japan and China! Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

The conference enthusiastically applauded the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and decided to send a congratulatory telegram. The conference ended with everyone singing the "Internationale." After the conference, the documentary films "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought" and "Chairman Mao's Third Reception of the Million Revolutionary Youth" were shown.

Notable figures attending the conference included Shiraishi Maru, Sakamoto Tokumatsu, Nishizawa Ryoji, Otsuka Yuchu, Makino Uji, Ogata Koichi, Kobayashi Yuichi, Yoshida Hosei, and Emachi Shyuji. (Accompanying photo)
