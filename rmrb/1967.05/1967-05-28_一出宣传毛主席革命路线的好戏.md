In September 1945, the Japanese imperialists who invaded China officially announced their surrender. Just as the people of Northeast China were celebrating the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the enemy of the Chinese people, Chiang Kai-shek, with the aid of American imperialism, broke his promise, tore up the ceasefire agreement, mobilized a large number of Nationalist troops, and gathered scattered Japanese puppet police and landlord thugs to form so-called "underground advance guards" of bandit forces, all launching a full-scale attack on our Northeast liberated areas, attempting to annihilate the people's army and seize the fruits of victory against Japan.

On December 28, 1945, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the directive "Establish a Solid Northeast Base" to the entire Party, "Leave the main road open and occupy the sides," shifting the focus of work in Northeast China to cities and vast rural areas farther from the Nationalist-controlled centers, mobilizing the masses, establishing solid bases, accumulating strength, and preparing for a counterattack.

Following Chairman Mao's directive, many units moved into the mountains to suppress bandits and eliminate harm to the people. At that time, I also participated in the anti-bandit struggle, and together with my comrades, we braved ice and snow, traversed forests and mountains. Despite countless difficulties, everyone was filled with high revolutionary spirit, determined to overcome all obstacles and strive for victory.

The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" reflects the true history of this period, vividly depicting the battle of a small detachment annihilating the bandit forces, who were recruited by the Nationalists and roamed in the forests and snowfields. This play not only exposes the brutality of the enemy but also showcases the bravery of our army. The entire drama is permeated with the red thread of people's war thought, fully reflecting the great truth that "the unity of the army and the people is invincible."

Watching this play not only reminds us of the glorious history of the Northeast People's Liberation Army, who, twenty years ago, under the wise command of Comrade Lin Biao, followed Chairman Mao's great directive to "Establish a Solid Northeast Base," organized several small detachments to enter the forests and snowfields, mobilize the masses, annihilate bandits, secure the rear, and coordinate with brother units to smash the American-Chiang attacks. It also educates and inspires us from the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers created on stage. Such a good play, each viewing brings education; such a Beijing opera, understandable and clear to hear, we love it, we welcome it!

However, over the past seventeen years of liberation, under the support of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han have controlled the cultural front, vigorously opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, and deliberately sabotaging our socialist economic foundation, attempting to turn literature into a tool for counter-revolutionary restoration and create public opinion for capitalist restoration. We workers and peasants firmly reject their wolfish ambitions!

At this time, when the people of the entire country are fiercely fighting against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we workers and peasants must definitely hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize, expose, and denounce the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line and its mastermind—the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, so that the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers can occupy all cultural fronts, and let Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line forever shine with brilliant splendor!

From now on, following the savior Communist Party, we will make the mountains and rivers change their appearance.

    一出宣传毛主席革命路线的好戏
    解放军某部　王德成
    一九四五年九月，侵略中国的日本帝国主义正式宣告投降。正当东北人民欢庆抗日战争胜利的时候，中国人民的公敌蒋介石在美帝国主义的援助下，背信弃义，撕毁了停战协定，调动了大批国民党军队，并且纠集了流散的日伪警察和地主流氓分子，组成了所谓“地下先遣军”的土匪武装，一齐向我东北解放区发动了全面进攻，企图消灭人民军队，夺取抗日胜利果实。
    一九四五年十二月二十八日，我们的伟大领袖毛主席向全党发出了《建立巩固的东北根据地》的指示，“让开大路，占领两厢”，把东北的工作重心放在距离国民党占领中心较远的城市和广大乡村，认真发动群众，建立巩固的根据地，积蓄力量，准备反攻。
    遵照毛主席的指示，许多部队转入山区剿匪，为人民除害。当时，我也参加了剿匪斗争，和战友们一起，爬冰卧雪，穿林翻山，纵有千难万险，大家都以高昂的革命精神，决心排除万难，去争取胜利。
    革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》反映了这一时期的真实历史，集中地表现了一个小分队消灭被国民党收编、流窜在林海雪原里的土匪武装的战斗经过。这个戏，既反映了敌人的残暴，更表现了我军的勇敢。全剧贯穿着一条人民战争思想的红线，充分反映了“军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌”的伟大真理。
    看了这出戏，不仅重温了我东北人民解放军在二十年前，遵照毛主席《建立巩固的东北根据地》的伟大指示，在林彪同志的英明指挥下，组织若干个小分队，深入林海雪原，发动群众，消灭土匪，巩固后方，配合兄弟部队，粉碎美蒋进攻的光荣史实，而且也使我们从舞台上塑造的工农兵英雄形象中受到了教育和鼓舞。这样的好戏，看一次受到一次教育，这样的京剧，看得懂，听得清，我们爱看，我们欢迎！
    可是，解放十七年来，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵等把持着文艺阵地，极力地反对毛主席的革命文艺路线，处心积虑地破坏我们社会主义的经济基础，企图把文艺变成反革命复辟的工具，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。他们的狼子野心，我们工农兵坚决不答应！
    在全国人民狠斗党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的时候，我们工农兵一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜，把反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批深，批透，批臭，让工农兵的英雄形象占领一切文艺阵地，让毛主席的革命文艺路线永远放射出绚丽的光彩！
