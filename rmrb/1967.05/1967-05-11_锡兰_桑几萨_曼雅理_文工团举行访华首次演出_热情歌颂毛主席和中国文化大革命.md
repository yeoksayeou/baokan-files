N. S. Kumarathunga, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Sri Lankan Communist Party, who is in Beijing, also watched the performance.

Tonight, the Sri Lankan "Sangisara Manjari" Art Troupe enthusiastically praised the red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China on the Chinese stage. They sang in Chinese, like the Red Guards of China, standing in front of the golden Mao Zedong statue, singing "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," playing "The Song of the Red Guards," "Long Live Chairman Mao," "The Quotations of Chairman Mao: Our Hope is Placed on You," and dancing the Chinese dance "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing." The young performers, in order to better express the boundless love and respect of the Sri Lankan people for the great leader Chairman Mao, also specially sang the song "From Sri Lanka to Beijing," composed by the troupe leader Kuruji Kemadasa and deputy leader Dharmasiri Mataka Gamini after they arrived in China. The authors expressed in the song their wish for the friendship between the peoples of Sri Lanka and China to be strengthened and their determination to bring the great Mao Zedong Thought back to Sri Lanka to guide the revolutionary struggle of the Sri Lankan people. During the performance, the performers repeatedly shouted "Long Live Chairman Mao!" after each performance.

The Sri Lankan "Sangisara Manjari" Art Troupe also performed the Sri Lankan dance drama "Sunrise," which reflected the struggle and victory of the workers and peasants of Sri Lanka in uniting to fight against the capitalist and landlord classes.

The performance of the Sri Lankan "Sangisara Manjari" Art Troupe, which is rich in revolutionary content and national style, was warmly welcomed by the audience in the capital. The entire audience applauded enthusiastically to congratulate their successful performance.

During the intermission, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo received the troupe leader Kuruji Kemadasa, deputy leader Dharmasiri Mataka Gamini, and all the performers, and had a cordial conversation with them.
