The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards have taken to the stage of the arts festival, enthusiastically singing the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao; they have taken up the weapon of art to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Twenty-five years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao, in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," taught us: "Literature and art should become part of the whole revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people and for attacking and annihilating the enemy, to help the people unite as one and fight against the enemy." Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, at this critical juncture of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the Shanghai Municipal Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art Festival has opened.

In this festival, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Shanghai, holding high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, have used art as a weapon and the stage as a battlefield. They have mobilized the revolutionary masses in a grand manner, organizing a vast army of revolutionary criticism, launching a powerful offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," this brilliant work that is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxist-Leninist literary theory, has illuminated the revolutionary stage of the Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art Festival with boundless light, making this festival appear with a new combat posture on the frontline of the great revolutionary criticism.

Since the festival opened on the streets on April 21, in just half a month, it has fully demonstrated its great political significance and powerful propaganda force. Composed of workers, peasants, Red Guards, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, more than 360 art cavalry units—"Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Detachments"—have, in factories, docks, fields, islands, squares, workers' new villages, and rural market towns, used the earth as their stage, braving the sun and rain, extensively carrying out combat propaganda activities.

This workers, peasants, and soldiers art festival vividly reflects the boundless love and admiration of the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary cadres for our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao. With the strongest and most fervent class feelings, with the highest praise, the most vigorous dances, they sing the praises of the great leader Chairman Mao, sing the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and sing the praises of the brilliant victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. At every performance, on stage and off stage, people repeatedly shout with emotion: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" "Wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The broad masses of workers and peasants, with the combat posture of the main force of the Cultural Revolution, have truly become the masters of culture and art on the revolutionary art stage, which is the greatest feature of this festival.

Shanghai is an important bastion of cultural and artistic endeavors in our country. Over the past seventeen years, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's literary thought, the laboring people here have created a wealth of precious treasures for the socialist cultural and artistic endeavors of our motherland. However, Shanghai was also a major den of decadent art in the 1930s, a key stronghold where a handful of revisionist elements like Zhou Yang and Xia Yan fiercely promoted the revisionist literary line, and an important bastion where the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road plotted counter-revolutionary restoration. Together with a handful of revisionist elements within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee, they stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. Therefore, the struggle between the two lines on the Shanghai art front has always been extremely sharp and intense.

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and also reclaimed the art stage that had been occupied by ghosts and snakes. Today, the broad masses of workers and peasants and the Red Guards have enthusiastically taken to the art stage. This is a major event of epoch-making significance in the current Cultural Revolution, and it is another new victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

The workers, peasants, and Red Guards remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important line in the general revolutionary front." They have directed the spearhead of the art weapon at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, deeply exposing the ugly faces of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and powerfully refuting the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies.

In the performance of "Peeling the Skin" and "Never Forget Class Bitterness" at Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill for the workers, the "old revolutionary" mask of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road was peeled off, exposing his counter-revolutionary old tricks, and revealing his reactionary essence of "exploitation is reasonable" to the public.

The workers and peasants have taken to the art stage in the great waves of class struggle, more fully demonstrating that they are the creators of new socialist culture and art. Starting from revolutionary interests and political struggle needs, they boldly broke through the old frameworks set up by bourgeois "authorities," and made many new creations in creation and performance art. Bourgeois academic "authorities" have always shouted about how "workers, peasants, and soldiers do not understand art," "singing and dancing art cannot ascend to the ivory tower," and boasted about the "first voice technique" theory and the "unity of stage effect and performance art" theory and so on. This festival has given these fallacies a resolute and powerful refutation with ironclad facts. The workers, peasants, and Red Guards, with various artistic forms full of strong revolutionary colors, have perfectly expressed the political content of the proletariat. In order to fully expose the reactionary essence of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, they created new performance forms such as "group poetry" and "drum and clapper talk," which are powerful and resonant to listen to.

Looking at the Shanghai art stage, it has never been as full of vitality and radiant as it is today. The broad masses of workers and peasants from the production and combat frontlines have fully demonstrated the mighty voice of the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution on the stage they have occupied, making this festival radiate the luster of the socialist era.

Another prominent feature of this festival is: the "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Detachments" have surged up like clouds and rain, deeply entering the masses, taking root among the masses, and actively participating in the frontline of the struggle, opening up a broad sky for art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and creating rich experiences in vigorously propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." What is particularly gratifying about this festival is that it has successfully raised the banner of the art detachment that can best serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

In the past, under the influence of the revisionist "theater art" policy of the Zhou Yang clique, Shanghai's art festivals were limited to large theaters, doing some "big, foreign, and ancient" things, detached from real struggles, and detached from the broad masses of workers and peasants. This festival, under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's literary thought, has turned the inverted history back to its rightful place. A large number of members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Detachments, carrying red flags, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, dressed in military uniforms, and with a heroic and majestic demeanor, have marched to the streets, deeply entering factories, rural areas, military units, and schools, singing and dancing for the broad masses of workers and peasants, and propagating Mao Zedong Thought. The masses enthusiastically praised: "The old Red Army propaganda team has come again!"

The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road said that the cultural and propaganda teams "only know how to twist the waist drum and beat the waist drum, and if they continue like this, they will be harmed.... They should not continue to mix like this." Under the guise of "reorganization," he ordered his henchmen, the Zhou Yang clique, to cut down and kill, driving the revolutionary cultural and propaganda teams into the "cold palace."

Today, the workers and peasants of Shanghai have proven with their own practices that the cultural and propaganda teams are the best organizational forms for serving the workers and peasants, and have powerfully refuted the reactionary fallacies of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road in suppressing the cultural and propaganda teams and resisting the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought. They have given this art organizational form the highest name: "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Detachments." These "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Detachments" are mobile and flexible, with simple equipment. The members of the detachments are versatile, able to create, perform, sing, and dance. Once they arrive at a place, they beat the drums, raise the red flags, and start propagating. The members of the detachments live among the masses, are closely related to the masses, and have deep class feelings, so the programs they perform can best reflect the wishes of the revolutionary masses and can timely reflect the real struggle. The programs such as "Smashing the 'Trust' Black Goods of the Number One Wild Ambitionist in the Party" performed by the "Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team" of Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, "Cadres and Members United in Battle, Firing the First Shot of Spring Plowing" performed by the propaganda team of Huxi Commune's Houjia Village, and "People's Soldiers Coming to the Fields" performed by the propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army Air Force, are deeply loved by the masses.

The tens of thousands of propagandists participating in this festival, in the process of creation and arrangement, have always insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, combining them with actual struggles to deeply touch the soul, and striving to achieve ideological revolutionization. The workers, peasants, and Red Guards participating in the festival, both on and off the stage, have raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is a most prominent feature of this festival compared to previous festivals.

Many of the workers, peasants, and Red Guards participating in the festival are red propagandists who raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on stage, and after the performance, they are models who enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have not abandoned the two burdens they carry on their shoulders, performing while producing and fighting. On stage, they use art to fiercely criticize the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the reactionary bourgeois line he represents; off stage, they join the revolutionary masses of their units to settle accounts with the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line. On stage, they propagate grasping the revolution and vigorously promoting production; off stage, they do not forget to emphasize politics, use the revolution to command work, actively engage in productive labor, and strengthen preparedness. On and off the stage, they are all proletarian revolutionary fighters who raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

"In this small globe, there are a few flies banging into the wall. Buzzing, a few mournful cries, a few sobs." Let the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and various reactionary academic "authorities" weep in the corner in front of the art stage of the workers and peasants! Let them tremble in the face of the mighty power of the revolutionary art weapon! The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate the revolutionary stage of Shanghai and will forever guide the broad masses of workers, peasants, and literary and art workers to stride forward on the revolutionary literary and art front!

### 毛主席的文艺思想光辉照亮上海文艺舞台

    毛主席的文艺思想光辉照亮上海文艺舞台
    广大工农兵和红卫兵小将登上文艺会演舞台，热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席；拿起文艺武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。
    二十五年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中教导我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”遵照毛主席的伟大教导，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线总决战的关键时刻，上海市工农兵文艺会演揭幕了。
    在这次会演中，上海市广大工农兵，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命的批判大旗，以文艺为武器，以舞台当战场，大张旗鼓地动员革命群众，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命批判大军，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开强大的攻势。
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇当代马克思列宁主义文艺理论最高峰的光辉著作，以无际的光焰照亮了上海工农兵文艺会演的革命舞台，使这次会演以崭新的战斗姿态出现在革命大批判的战线上。
    这次会演从四月二十一日在街头开幕以来，在短短的半个月里已充分显示出它的巨大政治意义和强大的宣传威力。由工人、农民、红卫兵小将和解放军战士组成的三百六十多个文艺轻骑兵——“毛泽东思想宣传小分队”，在工厂、码头、田间和海岛，以及广场、工人新村和乡村集镇，用大地作舞台，顶着骄阳，冒着风雨，广泛地开展了战斗的宣传活动。
    这次工农兵文艺会演，集中地反映了无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众，对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的无限热爱，无限崇拜。他们以最强烈、最饱满的阶级感情，以最崇高的赞词，最雄健的舞蹈，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利。每场演出，台上台下，人们都激情地一再高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    广大工农兵以文化大革命主力军的战斗姿态，在革命的文艺舞台上大演大唱，真正成了文化艺术的主人，是这次会演的最大特点。
    上海是我国文化艺术的重要阵地。十七年来，在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，这里的劳动人民为祖国社会主义文化艺术创造了大量的宝贵的财富。但是，上海也是三十年代文艺的大黑窝，是周扬、夏衍等一小撮修正主义分子拚命推行修正主义文艺路线的一个中心据点，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派策划反革命复辟的一个重要阵地。他们伙同旧上海市委内一小撮修正主义分子，顽固地抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线。因此，上海文艺战线上两条路线的斗争，一直是十分尖锐、十分激烈的。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，上海的无产阶级革命派，从旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里夺过了党政财文大权，也夺回了被牛鬼蛇神霸占的艺术舞台。今天，广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将踊跃登上了艺术舞台。这是当前文化大革命中具有划时代意义的大事，这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一新胜利。
    工农兵群众和红卫兵小将牢记毛主席的教导：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”他们把文艺武器的矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，深刻地揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶嘴脸，有力地批驳了反革命修正主义谬论。
    在上海国棉一厂为工人演出的《剥画皮》、《不忘阶级苦》等节目，剥开了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的“老革命”画皮，揭出了他反革命的臭老底，把他的胡说“剥削有理”的反动本质暴露于大庭广众。
    工农兵群众在阶级斗争的大风浪中登上艺术舞台，更充分显示出他们是崭新的社会主义文化艺术的创造者。他们从革命利益出发，从政治斗争需要出发，大胆冲破了资产阶级“权威”所设置的旧框框，在创作上和表演艺术上，都有很多新的创造。资产阶级学术“权威”一向叫嚷什么“工农兵不懂得艺术”，“唱唱跳跳的艺术登不上象牙塔”，吹嘘什么“发声技巧第一”论和“舞台效果与表演艺术的统一”论等等。这次会演，用铁的事实给这些谬论以坚决有力的回击。工农兵群众和红卫兵小将，以具有强烈革命色彩的多种多样的艺术形式，完美地表现了无产阶级政治内容。他们为了充分揭露党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反动本质，创造了“群口词”、“锣鼓快板”等新的表演形式，听来铿锵有力。
    纵观上海的文艺舞台，从来没有象今天这样朝气勃勃，光华灿烂。来自生产和战斗第一线的广大工农兵在自己占据的舞台上，充分显示出无产阶级文化大革命主力军的强大声威，使这次会演焕发出社会主义的时代的光彩。
    这次会演的又一个鲜明特点是：毛泽东思想宣传小分队，风起云涌，深入群众，扎根群众之中，活跃在斗争的第一线，开辟了文艺为工农兵服务的广阔天地，创造了大力宣传毛泽东思想的丰富经验。
    毛主席教导说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这次会演特别令人可喜的是，它成功地树起了最能为工农兵服务的文艺小分队这面旗帜。
    过去，在周扬之流的修正主义“剧场艺术”方针的影响下，上海历届文艺会演都是局限于大剧场，搞些“大、洋、古”的东西，脱离现实斗争，脱离广大工农兵群众。这次会演，在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，把被颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来了。大批毛泽东思想宣传小分队的队员，打着红旗，抬着毛主席画像，身穿军装，英姿勃勃，威武雄壮地走向街头，深入工厂、农村、部队和学校，为广大工农兵送歌献舞，宣传毛泽东思想。群众热烈赞颂说：“老红军宣传队又来了！”
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派胡说文工队、宣传队“就会扭扭秧歌，打打腰鼓，这样下去，是害了他们。……不要这样混下去了。”他借“整编”之名，指令他的走卒周扬之流，大砍大杀，把革命的文工队、宣传队打入“冷宫”。
    今天，上海的工农兵群众以自己的实践证明，文工队、宣传队是为工农兵服务的最好的组织形式，以最有力的事实批驳了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派扼杀文工队、抵制宣传毛泽东思想的反动谬论。他们把这一文艺组织形式给予最崇高的名称：“毛泽东思想宣传小分队”。这些“毛泽东思想宣传小分队”机动灵活，行装简便。小分队的宣传员一专多能，能创作，能表演，会唱会舞。他们到了一个地方，锣鼓一敲，红旗一举，就宣传起来。小分队的宣传员生活在群众之中，同群众息息相关，有着深厚的阶级感情，因此他们演出的节目最能充分体现革命群众的愿望，最能及时反映现实斗争。上海汽轮机厂“毛泽东思想宣传队”演出的《砸烂党内头号野心家的“托拉斯”黑货》，华漕公社侯家角大队宣传队的《社员干部团结战斗，打响春耕第一炮》，中国人民解放军空军某部宣传队的《人民战士下田来》等节目，深受群众欢迎。
    参加这次会演的成千上万个宣传员，在创作、排编过程中，始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，结合实际斗争狠触灵魂，努力实现思想革命化。参加会演的工农兵和红卫兵小将，在台上台下同样高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是这次会演不同于历届会演的一个最为显著的标志。
    参加会演的许多工农兵和红卫兵小将，演出时是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的红色宣传员，演出后又是热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的模范。他们没有丢掉肩上担负的两副担子，边演出，边生产，边战斗。他们在台上，通过文艺狠批党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线；在台下，同本单位的革命群众一起清算资产阶级反动路线的流毒。他们在台上，宣传狠抓革命，猛促生产；在台下，不忘突出政治，用革命统帅工作，积极从事生产劳动，加强战备。台上台下，他们同样是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级革命派战士。
      “小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。”让党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和形形色色反动学术“权威”，在工农兵群众的艺术舞台前向隅而泣吧！让他们在革命文艺武器的强大威力下发抖吧！光焰无际的毛泽东思想将永远照耀上海的革命舞台，将永远指引广大工农兵和文艺工作者在革命的文艺战线上阔步前进！
