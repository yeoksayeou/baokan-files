	Mao Zedong's revolutionary line on literature and art is victorious!
	In commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
	Mao Zedong Thought Nurtures Heroes

	Political Commissar of a certain unit of the PLA, former political instructor of the "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road," Liu Renfu

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people, especially for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are used by them." If we, the proletarian literary and art workers, want to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers well, we must create heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. "We must concentrate on creating artistic images of advanced revolutionaries to educate and inspire everyone and lead everyone forward." Comrade Jiang Qing said in 1964, expressing the wishes of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. We are particularly pleased that under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's thoughts on literature and art and under the specific guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, the proletarian revolutionary faction in the Peking opera world has created many dazzling heroic images in recent years. The heroic figures of Yang Zirong and Shao Jianbo in the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" are two notable examples. Through the meticulous portrayal of these two heroes, the opera enthusiastically praises the revolutionary heroism of our army's broad ranks of soldiers and officers who are not afraid of any hardships and dangers and want to "overcome all enemies." It depicts moving scenes of the army loving the people and the people supporting the army, deeply embodying and praising Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on people's war and people's army.

	The platoon leader Yang Zirong, this hero with a deep sense of bitterness and wisdom, has a strong infectious power. Yang Zirong "suffered from birth and death since childhood," "his old father was driven to hang himself by the landlord, and his old mother died of madness in the wilderness." It was only when he joined the Liberation Army and found the Communist Party and Chairman Mao that he was liberated. In the revolutionary crucible and under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, he grew rapidly. It was Chairman Mao's teachings that made him "resolve to move mountains like Yu the Great," "to smash the thousand-year-old chains of oppression and open the spring of happiness for generations to come." It was the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought that made him fearless, risking his life, and calmly entering the tiger's den alone. "The mountains are high and cannot block the road, the cold is severe and turns into ice and snow, but I have the morning sun in my heart!" This morning sun is the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! It is the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought that dispelled the severe cold for thousands of miles and melted the ice and snow for ten thousand miles! It is the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought that turned this orphan from a poor peasant family into a stalwart soldier of the proletariat! Whether in "Attacking the Bandit's Lair," "Sending Intelligence," "Meeting at the Banquet of a Hundred Chickens," and other scenes, we see everywhere that Mao Zedong Thought gave Yang Zirong endless wisdom, courage, and bravery, making him, in the face of cunning bandits and in critical moments of danger and change, always able to calmly and wisely fight against the enemy. Finally, he and Shao Jianbo's pursuit team met at the Tiger Hall and successfully completed the task of annihilating the remaining bandits. "Only heroes can drive away tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes who fear bears and tigers." We, the soldiers and officers of the PLA, enthusiastically applaud the appearance of this tall heroic figure on the Peking opera stage!

	Although Shao Jianbo, the regiment's chief of staff, is a military officer, throughout the play, he appears as an outstanding political worker. He always acts according to Chairman Mao's teachings. When looking for a way up the mountain, he uses Chairman Mao's teaching that "revolutionary war is the people's war" to explain the truth that our army cannot move an inch without the people. He uses Chairman Mao's teaching that "in strategy, we must despise the enemy, and in tactics, we must take the enemy seriously" to mobilize the masses extensively and decide to "take Tiger Mountain by strategy." When sending Yang Zirong alone to disguise as a bandit and enter the mountain, he remembers Chairman Mao's teaching that "our principle is that the party commands the gun" and decides to "hold a committee meeting to discuss and decide, using collective wisdom to defeat the enemy." In the final scene, when we see the complete annihilation of the bandits in the Tiger Hall and Shao Jianbo tightly grasping Yang Zirong's hand and excitedly shouting "Old Yang!" we cannot help but cheer for the appearance of these two full and tall heroic figures on the socialist Peking opera stage!

	Sunlight and rain nurture pines, Mao Zedong Thought nurtures heroes. When literary works depict heroic figures, the most fundamental thing is to depict how they grow under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and how Mao Zedong Thought blooms and bears fruit in the heroes, showing its great power.

	The reason why the heroic figures of Yang Zirong and Shao Jianbo are so tall is precisely because Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly on them. To learn from heroes, the most fundamental thing is to learn Mao Zedong Thought as the heroes do. Bai Qiuen, Zhang Zide, Liu Huilan, Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, and countless other heroes are all the results of being nurtured by the sunlight and rain of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the only source of heroes' growth.

	Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guarantee for the victory of all work, and it is the most powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and the ideological thoughts of all exploiting classes. Eighteen years ago, when we just entered Nanjing Road in Shanghai from the battlefield filled with gunpowder smoke, the bourgeoisie shouted arrogantly, wanting us to "come in red and go out black." It was the great Mao Zedong Thought that made us repel the enemy's sugar-coated bullets time and time again, dispel the sweet and poisonous mist, and stand firmly on Nanjing Road, maintaining the bright red color of our army. In recent years, when the bourgeois agents who infiltrated the army stirred up a wind of opposing Chairman Mao, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, and opposing our Vice Commander-in-Chief Lin Biao, it was the great Mao Zedong Thought that made us stand firm, maintain the correct direction, and resolutely uphold proletarian politics. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has given us endless wisdom and strength. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad ranks of soldiers and officers have launched a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and a handful of revisionists!

	The brilliant images of the heroic figures Yang Zirong and Shao Jianbo make us deeply feel: among a thousand principles, the first is to study Chairman Mao's works; among a thousand important things, the most important is to arm people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought. We must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to turn the army into a revolutionary school and resolutely implement Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to turn our army into a school of Mao Zedong Thought. We must educate every soldier to take heroes as examples, study Chairman Mao's books for life, reform their thoughts for life, revolutionize for life, and wholeheartedly serve the people for life. Starting from transforming the worldview, we must thoroughly break down selfish and杂念, thoroughly establish the public spirit, continuously expand the public area in our minds, and cultivate every comrade to become a good soldier of Chairman Mao who is dedicated to the public, everything for the public, full of the public spirit, and forever for the public! In the fiery class struggle, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, temper every revolutionary soldier into the most reliable and strongest successor of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and cultivate a generation of new communists full of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, selfless and fearless!

    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁
    纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    毛泽东思想育英雄
    解放军某团政委、前“南京路上好八连”指导员　刘仁福
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”我们无产阶级文艺要想很好地为工农兵服务，就必须塑造出用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵英雄形象。“我们要着重塑造先进革命者的艺术形象，给大家以教育鼓舞，带动大家前进。我们搞革命现代戏，主要是歌颂正面人物。”江青同志一九六四年讲的这段话，说出了广大工农兵群众的心愿。使我们感到特别高兴的是，在毛主席文艺思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的具体指导下，几年来，京剧界无产阶级革命派创作塑造了许多光彩夺目的英雄形象。革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》里的杨子荣、少剑波，便是其中引人注目的两个英雄形象。这出戏通过对这两个英雄人物的精心塑造，热情歌颂了我军广大指战员不怕任何艰难险阻而要“压倒一切敌人”的革命英雄主义气概，描写了军爱民、民拥军的动人场面，深刻地体现和歌颂了毛主席关于人民战争、人民军队的光辉思想。
    侦察排长杨子荣，这个苦大仇深、智勇双全的英雄人物，具有强烈的感染力。杨子荣“从小在生死线上受煎熬”，“老父亲被地主逼得悬梁上吊，老母亲气成疯癫死在荒郊”。当他参加了解放军，找到了共产党和毛主席，才得到了解放。在革命的大熔炉里，在毛泽东思想哺育下，他迅速地成长起来。是毛主席的教导使他“立下愚公移山志”，“为砸碎千年铁锁链，为人民开出万代幸福泉”；是光辉的毛泽东思想使他浑身是胆，冒着生命危险，泰然只身入虎穴。“山高不能把路挡，抗严寒化冰雪我胸有朝阳”！这朝阳就是我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席！是光辉的毛泽东思想驱走了千里严寒，融化掉万里冰霜！是光辉的毛泽东思想使这个贫农的孤儿，成为无产阶级的硬骨头战士！不管是在“打匪窟”，还是在“计送情报”、“会师百鸡宴”等场戏里，处处看到毛泽东思想给了杨子荣无穷的智慧、勇气和胆量，使他在奸诈的顽匪面前，在险象环生、情况急变的关键时刻，始终能沉着机智地与敌人斗争，最后终于和少剑波带来的追剿队伍会师威虎厅，胜利完成全歼残匪的任务。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”我们解放军指战员为京剧舞台上出现这个高大的英雄形象热烈喝采！
    团参谋长少剑波虽是军事干部，但整个戏里却是以一个优秀的政治工作干部出现的。他处处按毛主席的教导办事，在寻找上山途径时，他运用毛主席“革命战争是群众的战争”的教导，说明了我军脱离群众便“寸步难行”的真理。他运用毛主席在战略上要藐视敌人、在战术上要重视敌人的教导，广泛发动群众，决定“智取”威虎山。在派遣杨子荣只身扮匪进山时，他牢记毛主席关于“我们的原则是党指挥枪”的教导，决定“开支委会讨论决定，用集体的智慧战胜敌人”。最后一场戏，当我们看到在威虎厅里全歼顽匪，少剑波紧握着杨子荣的手，激动地喊一声“老杨！”的时候，我们禁不住为社会主义的京剧舞台出现这样两个丰满高大的英雄形象而欢呼！
    阳光雨露育青松，毛泽东思想育英雄。文艺作品要描写英雄人物，最根本的是要描写他们怎样在毛泽东思想哺育下成长，描写毛泽东思想在英雄们身上如何开花结果和发挥出巨大的威力。
    杨子荣、少剑波这两个英雄形象所以如此高大，正是因为在他们身上闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。学英雄，最根本的是要象英雄们那样来学习毛泽东思想。白求恩、张思德、刘胡兰、雷锋、欧阳海、王杰等无数英雄，都是毛泽东思想的阳光雨露哺育的结果。毛泽东思想是英雄成长的唯一源泉。
    毛泽东思想是一切工作胜利的根本，是战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派和一切剥削阶级思想的最强大的思想武器。十八年前，当我们从硝烟弥漫的战场刚刚进驻上海南京路时，资产阶级向我们发出狂妄叫嚣，要我们“红着进来，黑着出去”。是伟大的毛泽东思想，使我们击退了阶级敌人糖衣炮弹一次又一次的进攻，驱散了香风毒雾，脚跟稳稳地站在南京路上，保持了我军鲜红鲜红的颜色。前几年，当混进军队内的资产阶级代理人刮起一股反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想、反对我们副统帅林彪同志的妖风时，是伟大的毛泽东思想使我们站稳了立场，坚持了方向，坚决突出了无产阶级政治。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，是伟大的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的智慧和力量。广大指战员，在毛泽东思想的指引下，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮修正主义分子猛烈开火！
    杨子荣、少剑波这两个英雄人物的光辉形象，使我们深深地感到：千条万条，学习毛主席著作第一条；千重要万重要，用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑最重要。我们要热烈响应毛主席把军队办成革命化大学校的伟大号召，坚决执行林副主席把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校的指示。我们要教育每一个战士以英雄为榜样，学一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想，革一辈子命，全心全意当一辈子人民勤务员。从改造世界观入手，大破私心杂念，大立公字，不断扩大头脑中的公区，培养每个同志成为一心为公、一切为公、浑身是公、永远为公的毛主席的好战士！我们要在火热的阶级斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把我们每个革命战士锻炼成无产阶级革命事业最可靠、最坚强的接班人，造就成充满毛泽东思想光辉、无私无畏的一代共产主义新人！
