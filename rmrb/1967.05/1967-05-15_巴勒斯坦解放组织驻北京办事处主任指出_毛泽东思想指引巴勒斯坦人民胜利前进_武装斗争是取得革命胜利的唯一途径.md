On the eve of "Palestine Day," the head of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Beijing, Jalb, received a reporter from this news agency and introduced the situation of the Palestinian people's struggle. Jalb emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought has become a powerful ideological weapon for the world's people in their revolutionary struggles. The Palestinian people and their army are striving to study Mao Zedong Thought because they believe that Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the Palestinian people's revolutionary struggle.

Jalb said in the conversation, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution.' Chairman Mao also teaches us that we must distinguish between the principal and secondary contradictions. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have identified our principal enemy, which is American imperialism; Israel is merely a base for American imperialism's aggression against Arab countries. He said, when the people understand their enemies, they will fight against them until they achieve victory.

He said, the Israeli army is a tool of American imperialism, a fascist army. The Palestinian people have learned from their struggle that the only way for the Palestinian people to achieve victory is through armed struggle. He said, after establishing their own liberation organization, the Palestinian people have built their own army. Chairman Mao expounds on the theory of people's war in his works. We believe in armed struggle and people's war.

He said, we believe that revolutionary ideology is the foundation of revolutionary struggle. If the people are not armed with revolutionary ideology, we cannot say that our strength is sufficient. Because what determines the outcome of a war is people, not weapons. For this reason, the Palestinian people and their army are now studying Chairman Mao's works.

Jalb pointed out that some major powers believe in "peaceful coexistence" with imperialism. They do not want revolution and do not hope for revolution. However, the Palestinian people want revolution. They will not "peacefully coexist" with imperialism and Israel, no matter what the cost, the Palestinian people will fight to the end.

Jalb firmly said, we believe that the people have the power. Although American imperialism is trying every means to prevent the Palestinian revolution from happening, the revolution will inevitably occur. American imperialism's schemes can only expose its nature and awaken the people. American imperialism's schemes can only dig its own grave.

Jalb said, the struggle of the Palestinian people is not isolated. It has the support of all the people of the Arab countries and the people of the world. He expressed gratitude for the assistance given to the Palestinian people by the Chinese people. He said, the Palestinian people have deep respect for the Chinese people, the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party, and Chairman Mao. The Chinese people have already contributed to supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people and will definitely continue to do so in the future. Because the great political line formulated by Chairman Mao is a great line. This line points out that the people who have already been liberated should help those who have not been liberated. China is implementing a political line of supporting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. All Palestinian people and Arab people will never forget this great stance of the Chinese people. Jalb said, the Palestinian people and the Chinese people have a common enemy—American imperialism. We will fight together. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has further raised the consciousness of the Chinese people. They will defeat imperialism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. I believe that the Palestinian people and the Chinese people will defeat our common enemy, American imperialism.

Jalb said with great confidence, we believe in the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and believe that the power of the people is invincible. The revolutionary cause of the Palestinian people will definitely be victorious because our struggle is just.

    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任指出
    毛泽东思想指引巴勒斯坦人民胜利前进
    武装斗争是取得革命胜利的唯一途径
    新华社十四日讯　在“巴勒斯坦日”前夕，巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布接见本社记者，介绍了巴勒斯坦人民斗争的情况。加尔布强调说，毛泽东思想已经成为世界人民进行革命斗争的强大思想武器。巴勒斯坦人民和军队正努力学习毛泽东思想，因为他们认为毛泽东思想是指导巴勒斯坦人民进行革命斗争的指路明灯。
    加尔布在谈话中说，毛主席教导说，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”毛主席还教导说，必须分清主要的矛盾和次要的矛盾。按照毛主席的教导，我们找到了我们的主要敌人，这就是美帝国主义；以色列只不过是美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的一个基地。他说，当人民了解了他们的敌人以后，他们就会和敌人进行斗争，直至取得胜利。
    他说，以色列的军队是美帝国主义的仆从，是法西斯的军队。巴勒斯坦人民从斗争实践中认识到，巴勒斯坦人民要取得斗争的胜利，唯一的途径是要靠武装斗争。他说，巴勒斯坦人民在成立自己的解放组织以后，就建立了自己的军队。毛主席在他的著作中阐述了人民战争的理论。我们就是信奉武装斗争，信奉人民战争。
    他说，我们认为，革命的思想是进行革命斗争的基础，假若人民没有用革命思想武装起来，就不能说我们的力量已经够了。因为决定战争胜负的是人，而不是武器。正因为如此，巴勒斯坦人民和军队，现在正在学习毛主席著作。
    加尔布指出，一些大国相信同帝国主义“和平共处”，他们不要革命，不希望革命。但是巴勒斯坦人民是要革命的，他们决不会同帝国主义和以色列“和平共处”，不管付出多少代价，巴勒斯坦人民都要斗争到底。
    加尔布坚定地说，我们相信人民是有力量的，尽管美帝国主义千方百计企图阻止巴勒斯坦革命的发生，但是革命迟早要发生的，美帝国主义的一切阴谋只能暴露它的本质，唤起人民觉悟，美帝国主义的阴谋活动只能是自掘坟墓。
    加尔布说，巴勒斯坦人民的斗争不是孤立的，它得到所有阿拉伯国家人民和世界各国人民的支持。他表示感谢中国人民给予巴勒斯坦人民的援助。他说，巴勒斯坦人民对中国人民、中国政府、中国共产党和毛主席怀着深切的敬仰。中国人民已经对支援巴勒斯坦人民的斗争作出了贡献，将来也一定会作出贡献，因为伟大的毛主席制定的政治路线是伟大的路线，这条路线指出，已经获得了解放的人民应该帮助没有解放的人民。中国执行着支持各国人民革命斗争的政治路线。所有巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民永远不会忘记中国人民这种伟大的立场。加尔布说，巴勒斯坦人民和中国人民有着共同的敌人——美帝国主义，我们将共同战斗。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，进一步提高了中国人民的觉悟，他们将会战胜帝国主义和防止资本主义复辟。我相信，巴勒斯坦人民和中国人民将战胜我们的共同敌人美帝国主义。
    加尔布满怀信心地说，我们相信毛泽东思想的巨大威力，相信人民的力量是不可战胜的。巴勒斯坦人民的革命事业一定会取得胜利，因为我们的斗争是正义的。
