    The so-called "Western culture" is nothing but capitalist culture, imperialist culture. As the imperialist system declines, its culture is also rapidly declining, becoming the most reactionary, most decadent, and most ugly thing. However, this declining "Western culture" has found a "new world" in the Soviet Union under the rule of the Soviet revisionists, spreading there like a flood.

    Revisionist ideology is originally the ideology of the bourgeoisie. The Soviet revisionist leadership and the privileged class they represent are themselves the bourgeoisie. Their reactionary worldview, their ugly souls, and their decadent lifestyles are all in tune with "Western culture." Therefore, they are enthusiastic about "Western culture," bow down to "Western culture," eagerly imitate "Western culture," and strive to spread "Western culture." This is not at all surprising.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." Reactionary culture serves the reactionary ruling class.

    American imperialism has always used its reactionary culture and "American way of life" as tools for reactionary rule at home and aggressive expansion abroad. At the same time, it uses this to push for "peaceful evolution" in socialist countries. The Washington ruling clique has openly advocated: "To instill Western principles, Western styles, and Western tastes into the Soviet Union," to "influence the changes within the Soviet Union." The Soviet revisionist leadership's open-door policy to "Western culture" and its so-called "cultural exchange" with American imperialism is a pandering to American imperialism and serving American imperialism.

    The traitors, including Khrushchev and his successors, used bourgeois ideology to prepare public opinion before seizing power; after seizing power, they need to use bourgeois ideology and "Western culture" to deceive and lull the masses, in order to speed up the full realization of capitalist restoration and maintain their revisionist rule.

    The Soviet revisionist leadership shamelessly boasts that a "cultural revolution" has been completed in the Soviet Union, which is sheer nonsense. In fact, what the Soviet revisionist leadership is fully implementing in the cultural sphere is a thorough counter-revolutionary plan. The Soviet revisionist clique foolishly thinks that it can use these vicious means to prevent the Soviet people from rising up against them, which is absolutely impossible. The broad masses of the Soviet people will sooner or later rise up to overthrow their rule and bury this small handful of traitors along with the decadent "culture" they use as a shield.

    毒贩子的险恶用心
    所谓“西方文化”，也就是资本主义文化、帝国主义文化。随着帝国主义制度的没落，它的文化也在迅速没落，成为最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的东西。然而，这种没落的“西方文化”，竟然在苏修集团统治下的苏联找到了“新天地”，象潮水一样地在那里泛滥起来。
    修正主义思潮，本来就是资产阶级的意识形态。而苏修领导集团和他们所代表的苏联特权阶层，本身就是资产阶级。他们的反动世界观，他们的丑恶灵魂，他们的腐朽的生活方式，样样都同“西方文化”臭味相投。因此，他们倾心于“西方文化”，拜倒于“西方文化”，热中于模仿“西方文化”，竭力传播“西方文化”，这是一点也不奇怪的。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”反动文化是为反动的统治阶级服务的。
    美帝国主义从来就是把它的反动文化和“美国生活方式”作为对内实行反动统治，对外实行侵略扩张的工具，同时它也把这一套作为对社会主义国家推行“和平演变”的重要手段。华盛顿统治集团曾经公开鼓吹：“将西方的原则、西方的风格和西方的趣味灌输到苏联去”，以“影响苏联内部的演变”。苏修领导集团向“西方文化”大开门户，同美帝国主义大搞所谓“文化交流”，就是迎合美帝国主义，为美帝国主义效劳的。
    赫鲁晓夫及其继承者这一伙叛徒，在篡夺政权之前，就利用资产阶级意识形态作了舆论准备；在篡夺政权之后，则更需要利用资产阶级思想和“西方文化”，来欺骗和麻痹群众，以便加速全面实现资本主义复辟，并维护他们的修正主义统治。
    苏修领导集团恬不知耻地叫嚷，在苏联已经完成了“文化革命”，这完全是胡扯。事实上，苏修领导集团在文化领域中正在全力完成的，是彻头彻尾的反革命计划。苏修集团妄想靠这种恶毒的手段，来阻止苏联人民起来造他们的反，这是绝对办不到的。广大的苏联人民迟早会起来推翻他们的统治，把这一小撮叛徒连同作为他们护身符的腐朽“文化”一起埋葬。
