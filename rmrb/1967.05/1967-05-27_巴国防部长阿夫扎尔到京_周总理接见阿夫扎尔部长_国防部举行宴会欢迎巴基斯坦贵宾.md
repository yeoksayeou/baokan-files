Pakistani Defense Minister Afzal Rahman Khan, a Navy Admiral, arrived in Beijing today from Shanghai by special plane. Accompanying him were Pakistani Foreign Secretary Yusuf and others. They came at the invitation of the Chinese government for a friendly visit. The guests were warmly welcomed at the airport by relevant officials from China, soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Red Guards from the capital.

Those who went to the airport to welcome them included: Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, Deputy Minister of National Defense Xiao Jinguang and Wang Shusheng, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, and leaders from various departments and military branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, including Peng Shaohui, Yuan Ziqin, Zhang Xianyao, Zhou Xihan, and Chang Qinkun, as well as relevant officials and leaders from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee.

Today, the capital airport was bright with sunshine, flags were flying, and the sound of drums and revolutionary songs filled the air, creating a warm atmosphere of friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. Over a thousand soldiers and Red Guards from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, along with young Red Guards from the capital, held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to welcome the friendly guests from a neighboring country. When Afzal Rahman Khan and others stepped off the plane, Ye Jianying and others went forward to shake hands and greet them warmly. Soldiers presented them with flowers. Then, the guests, accompanied by their hosts, walked around the field to meet the welcoming crowd. At this time, people shouted slogans such as: "Welcome to the Pakistani guests!" "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan!" "Down with imperialism and old and new colonialism!" "Down with modern revisionism!" "Long live the great unity of the peoples of the world!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" Afzal Rahman Khan repeatedly waved to the welcoming crowd.

The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Ministry of National Defense, Pan Zhenwu, who went to Shanghai to welcome the guests, and Pakistani Air Force Attaché I.H. Khan, a Colonel, arrived in Beijing on the same plane.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan, and military attachés from some countries' embassies in China, also went to the airport to welcome the guests.

New China News Agency, May 26th: Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council met with Pakistani Defense Minister Afzal Rahman Khan, a Navy Admiral, and Foreign Secretary Yusuf this afternoon and had a warm and friendly conversation with them.

Present at the meeting were Ye Jianying, Xiao Jinguang, Wang Shusheng, Peng Shaohui, and Han Nianlong.

Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan was also present.

New China News Agency, May 26th: The Ministry of National Defense held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome Pakistani Defense Minister Afzal Rahman Khan, a Navy Admiral, and Pakistani Foreign Secretary Yusuf and others who came to China for a friendly visit.

Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying and Afzal Rahman Khan gave warm and friendly speeches at the banquet.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xiao Hua, Deputy Ministers of National Defense Xiao Jinguang and Wang Shusheng, and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong attended the banquet.

Ye Jianying, on behalf of our deputy commander Lin Biao and the Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended a warm welcome to Afzal Rahman Khan and the Pakistani guests.

He said, China and Pakistan are friendly neighboring countries connected by mountains and rivers. Our two peoples have a long history of traditional friendship. He pointed out that the more the U.S. imperialists and their followers try to sabotage and destroy Sino-Pakistani friendship, the more it shows that Sino-Pakistani friendship is in the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries and is beneficial to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism of the peoples of Asia and Africa. The consolidation and development of friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan are unstoppable by any force.

Ye Jianying praised the hardworking and brave Pakistani people, who, when faced with armed attacks by the Indian reactionaries, who are the lackeys of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, rose up to resist and dealt a heavy blow to the aggressors, safeguarding their national sovereignty and national dignity. He said, however, as our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed - this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." In recent years, U.S. imperialism and its followers have tried to make Pakistan abandon its independent foreign policy and join their anti-China "holy alliance" of imperialism, revisionism, and reaction. The Pakistani government and people have resisted this pressure, which not only serves the interests of the Pakistani state and people but also contributes to strengthening Asian-African unity against imperialism and the cause of safeguarding world peace. No matter in the past, present, or future, the 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will firmly support the just struggle of the Pakistani people to safeguard national independence and territorial sovereignty and oppose foreign aggression, and resolutely support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination.

Ye Jianying strongly condemned the recent actions of U.S. imperialism in bombing Hanoi and Haiphong while brazenly invading the demilitarized zone in Vietnam. He said, this is a serious escalation of the war and a reckless act of expanding the war. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are closely watching every move of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and are ready to take all necessary actions at any time according to the requests of the Vietnamese government and people.

He said, our great leader Mao Zedong personally founded the People's Republic of China, which has been established for more than seventeen years. In these seventeen years, our country has achieved brilliant achievements in all fronts of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, under the personal leadership of our great leader Mao Zedong, has again achieved great victories and has been hailed by revolutionary people all over the world.

Ye Jianying, when talking about imperialism and modern revisionism feeling that their end is near and being in a state of panic, using all their propaganda machines to slander and attack our country's Cultural Revolution, pointed out that this shows that our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent! He said, after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a socialist China that will never change color and will be even more prosperous will be even more effective in fighting against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, more powerful in supporting the revolutionary people of the world, and better in fulfilling our internationalist duties.

Afzal Rahman Khan, in his speech, talked about the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan, saying, we Pakistani people recognize the importance of friendship and close cooperation with your great country. Our friendship has a long cultural tradition and historical foundation, and our close cooperation in all aspects can only be mutually beneficial. I am deeply convinced that the cooperation between our two countries will strengthen with the passage of time.

He said, we Pakistani people have learned about the brilliant achievements of the great Chinese people under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. We admire that China has made such rapid progress in such a short time by relying on self-reliance. He wished the Chinese people greater progress, greater achievements, and greater prosperity.

Afzal Rahman Khan said, when Pakistan was fighting against Indian aggression, the Chinese government gave firm support to Pakistan, and we express our thanks. He wished Chairman Mao good health and longevity!

Guests invited to the banquet included Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan and military attachés from other countries' embassies in China.

    巴国防部长阿夫扎尔到京  周总理接见阿夫扎尔部长
    国防部举行宴会欢迎巴基斯坦贵宾
    据新华社二十六日讯  巴基斯坦国防部长阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗海军中将，今天从上海乘专机到达北京。陪同前来的，有巴基斯坦外事秘书优素福等。他们是应我国政府邀请前来进行友好访问的。客人们在机场上受到了我国有关方面负责人、中国人民解放军指战员和首都红卫兵的热烈欢迎。
    到机场欢迎的有：国防委员会副主席叶剑英，国防部副部长萧劲光、王树声，外交部副部长韩念龙，中国人民解放军各总部、各军种的负责人彭绍辉、袁子钦、张贤约、周希汉、常乾坤等，以及有关方面和北京市革命委员会的负责人。
    今天，首都机场上阳光灿烂，红旗飘扬，锣鼓声和革命歌曲声，响成一片，洋溢着中巴两国人民热烈友好的气氛。一千多名中国人民解放军陆海空军指战员和首都红卫兵小将拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，欢迎友好邻邦的客人。当阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗部长等走下飞机的时候，叶剑英副主席等迎上前去，热烈握手问好，解放军战士向客人们献了鲜花。接着，客人在主人陪同下绕场一周，同欢迎的群众见面。这时，人们高呼：“欢迎巴基斯坦贵宾！”“中巴两国人民友好万岁！”“打倒帝国主义和新老殖民主义！”“打倒现代修正主义！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”等口号。阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗部长不断向欢迎的人们挥手致意。
    专程前往上海迎接的我国防部办公厅副主任潘振武，巴基斯坦驻中国大使馆空军武官伊·哈·汗空军上校，同机到达北京。
    巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆·汗，一些国家驻中国大使馆武官，也到机场迎接。
    新华社二十六日讯  国务院总理周恩来今天下午接见巴基斯坦国防部长阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗海军中将、外事秘书优素福，同他们进行了热情友好的谈话。
    接见时在座的有叶剑英、萧劲光、王树声、彭绍辉、韩念龙等。
    巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆·汗也在座。
    据新华社二十六日讯  国防部今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎来我国进行友好访问的巴基斯坦国防部长阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗海军中将、巴基斯坦外事秘书优素福等。
    国防委员会副主席叶剑英和阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗部长在宴会上先后发表了热情友好的讲话。
    国务院副总理陈毅，中国人民解放军总政治部主任萧华，国防部副部长萧劲光、王树声，外交部副部长韩念龙等出席宴会。
    叶剑英代表我们的副统帅林彪同志，代表中华人民共和国国防部和中国人民解放军，向阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗部长和各位巴基斯坦贵宾，表示热烈的欢迎。
    他说，中巴两国，是山水相连的友好邻邦。我们两国人民有着悠久的传统的友谊。他指出，美帝国主义及其追随者越是百般敌视和破坏中巴友谊，就越说明中巴友好是符合中巴两国人民的根本利益的，是有利于亚非各国人民团结反帝事业的。中巴两国人民友谊的巩固和发展，是任何力量也不能阻挡的。
    叶剑英赞扬勤劳勇敢的巴基斯坦人民，在遭到美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的走卒、印度反动派的武装进攻时，奋起反抗，沉重地打击了侵略者，维护了自己国家的主权和民族尊严。他说，然而，正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说的：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义及其追随者，近年来力图使巴基斯坦放弃执行独立自主的对外政策，而纳入其帝、修、反三位一体的反华“神圣同盟”。巴基斯坦政府和人民抵抗了这种压力，这不仅符合巴基斯坦国家和人民的利益，而且对于加强亚非团结反帝、保卫世界和平的事业也作出了贡献。不论过去、现在和将来，七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军，都坚定不移地支持巴基斯坦人民为维护民族独立和领土主权、反对外来侵略所进行的正义斗争，坚决支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的正义斗争。
    叶剑英强烈谴责美帝国主义最近一面疯狂轰炸河内、海防，一面悍然侵入越南非军事区。他说，这是一个严重的战争“升级”和扩大战争的冒险行动。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和中国人民解放军，正百倍警惕地密切注视美帝国主义及其同谋者的一举一动，并将根据越南政府和人民的要求，随时准备采取一切必要的行动。
    他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的中华人民共和国建立十七年多了。十七年多来，我国在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各个战线上都取得了光辉的成就。目前，中国的无产阶级文化大革命，在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下，又取得了伟大的胜利，受到了全世界革命人民的欢呼。
    叶剑英在谈到帝国主义和现代修正主义感到末日来临，恐慌万状，开动所有宣传机器，大肆辱骂、攻击我国的文化大革命时指出，这正说明我国的无产阶级文化大革命好得很！他说，经过无产阶级文化大革命，一个永不变色的、更加兴旺的社会主义中国，将更有效地进行反对以美国为首的帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，更有力地支援全世界革命人民，更好地担负我们应尽的国际主义义务。
    阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗在讲话中谈到中巴两国人民友谊时说，我们巴基斯坦人民认识到同你们伟大国家友好和密切合作的重要性。我们之间的友谊有着悠久的文化传统和历史的基础，我们之间的各方面的密切合作只能是互利的。我深信，我们两国之间的合作，将随着时间的增长而加强。
    他说，我们巴基斯坦人民了解到伟大的中国人民在毛泽东主席英明领导下所取得的光辉成就。我们对中国在这样短的时间内依靠自力更生取得了飞跃的进步，感到钦佩。他祝中国人民将取得更大的进步，更大的成就和更大的繁荣。
    阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗说，在巴基斯坦抗击印度侵略的时候，中国政府对巴基斯坦给予了坚决的支持，我们表示感谢。他祝愿毛主席健康长寿！
    应邀出席宴会的，有巴基斯坦驻中国大使苏尔坦·穆·汗和其他国家驻中国大使馆武官。
