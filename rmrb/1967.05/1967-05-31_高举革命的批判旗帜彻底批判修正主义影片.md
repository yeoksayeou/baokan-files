Beginning on June 2, the poisonous films "City That Never Sleeps," "The Lin Family Shop," "Thousands of Miles Against the Wind," "Two Families," "The Life of Wu Xun," and "Sparkling Fire" will be shown to the people nationwide. Let the broad revolutionary masses denounce and criticize them thoroughly.

Over the past seventeen years, the film industry, like other literary and artistic fields, has been dominated by a counter-revolutionary revisionist black line. The main representatives of this black line are the counter-revolutionary revisionists Luo Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Xia Yan, and their clique; their ultimate backer is the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. This clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, in order to realize their dream of restoring capitalism, have formed factions, conspired together, used all sorts of tricks, and employed every means to spread counter-revolutionary propaganda. Film is a highly influential and widely accessible art form, a powerful tool for shaping public opinion, and they naturally would not let it go. For seventeen years, they have tightly controlled this sector, churning out a large number of anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous films.

The six poisonous films, including "City That Never Sleeps," are based on the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. These poisonous films openly or subtly advocate "selling out the country is justified" and "exploitation is beneficial," promote the theory of the extinction of class struggle and bourgeois reformism, advocate slavery and class capitulation, and even falsify Party history to glorify the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. These poisonous films shamelessly beautify and praise the overthrown exploiting classes, viciously defame and slander revolutionary masses and the people's army, boosting the morale of reactionary forces and demoralizing revolutionary people. These poisonous films are ironclad evidence of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party's attempt to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

In August 1964, Chairman Mao, in his instructions on the public screening and criticism of the films "North of the Yalu River" and "Early Spring in February," said: "Not only should these films be shown in a few major cities, but they should also be shown in several dozen to over a hundred medium-sized cities, making these revisionist materials public. It is possible that there are not only these two films, but also others that need to be criticized."

Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions have issued a great call to arms. We must expose all poisonous films to the public, lay them bare in broad daylight, and criticize them thoroughly to eradicate them completely. Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no progress; without stopping, there can be no advancement. Unless we uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line cannot be implemented; unless we seize back the film industry from the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have usurped it, revolutionary films that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought cannot be established.

Currently, conducting a revolutionary criticism of these poisonous films is an important part of the movement to criticize the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and a crucial component of the struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic field. In this great criticism, we must thoroughly expose the counter-revolutionary revisionists Luo Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, and others' past schemes of fake criticism and real cover-up. They have deliberately avoided the key issues, attempting to lead the revolutionary criticism into a dead-end "pure academic" discussion. They have used their authority to wield the stick, vigorously preventing the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers from criticizing. This is intolerable!

We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force, take up the weapon of literary and artistic criticism, and launch a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the revisionist black line he supports. We must grasp the key issues, criticize these poisonous films deeply and thoroughly.

    高举革命的批判旗帜彻底批判修正主义影片
    本报评论员
    从六月二日起，《不夜城》、《林家铺子》、《逆风千里》、《两家人》、《武训传》、《燎原》等六部毒草影片，将在全国人民面前示众，让广大革命群众口诛笔伐，进行彻底批判。
    十七年来，电影阵地如同其他文学艺术阵地一样，被一条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线专了我们的政。这条黑线的主要代表人物，就是反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬、林默涵、夏衍等一伙；他们的总后台，就是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。这一伙反革命修正主义分子，为了实现复辟资本主义的迷梦，结党营私，狼狈为奸，施展种种诡计，耍尽种种手段，大肆制造反革命的舆论。电影是一种群众性非常广泛的艺术，是一种非常厉害的舆论工具，他们当然不肯放过。十七年来，他们紧紧地把持着电影这个部门，抛出了一大批反党反社会主义的毒草影片。
    《不夜城》等六部毒草影片，是以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命谬论为灵魂炮制出来的大毒草。这些毒草影片，明目张胆地或隐晦曲折地宣扬“卖国有理”和“剥削有功”，宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”和资产阶级改良主义，宣扬奴隶主义和阶级投降主义，甚至篡改党史，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派树碑立传。这些毒草影片，无耻地美化和歌颂被推翻了的剥削阶级，恶毒地丑化和污蔑革命群众和人民军队，大长反动势力的志气，大灭革命人民的威风。这些毒草影片，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的铁的罪证。
    一九六四年八月，毛主席在关于公开放映和批判电影《北国江南》、《早春二月》的报告上批示：“不但在几个大城市放映，而且应在几十个至一百多个中等城市放映，使这些修正主义材料公之于众。可能不只这两部影片，还有别的，都需要批判。”
    毛主席的英明指示，向我们发出了伟大的战斗号召。凡是毒草影片，我们都要把它们公诸于众，暴露在光天化日之下，痛加批判，彻底铲除。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。不把反革命修正主义的文艺黑线连根挖掉，毛主席的革命文艺路线就不能贯彻；不把被一小撮反革命修正主义分子所窃踞的电影阵地夺回来，闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命电影就树立不起来。
    目前，对这些毒草影片进行革命的大批判，是对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动的一个重要内容，是深入开展文艺战线上两条路线的斗争的一个重要组成部分。在这场大批判中，我们必须彻底揭露反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬、林默涵等过去对这些反动影片搞的假批判、真掩盖的大阴谋。极力回避要害问题，企图把一场革命的大批判，引向“纯学术”的死胡同中去。他们利用职权，挥舞棍棒，极力阻止广大工农兵起来批判。是可忍，孰不可忍？
    我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以工农兵为主力军，拿起文艺批判的武器，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他所支持的修正主义文艺黑线猛烈开火，一定要抓住要害，把这些毒草影片批深、批透。
