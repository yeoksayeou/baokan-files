The new system being implemented by the Soviet revisionist leadership in industrial enterprises is a further attempt to replace socialist public ownership with a bourgeois privileged class ownership, turning the vast majority of workers into wage slaves who sell their labor.

The "new system" grants enterprise leaders more and greater privileges. According to the relevant Soviet official "regulations," a small clique of enterprise leaders can "act in the name of the enterprise without authorization." They have the power to control production materials and working capital, can arbitrarily determine and change the wages and bonuses of workers, have the authority to hire, fire, and punish workers, and can independently approve the structure and staffing of the enterprise. Soviet newspapers loudly proclaim that the "new system" is "implementing enterprise management on the basis of one-man rule."

		"Factory owners" wield great power, workers suffer oppression
According to Soviet publications, the leaders of enterprises implementing the "new system" are "all-powerful," arrogant, and say things like, "I am my own master, I can do as I please." Like capitalist enterprises, they often use the pretext of "reducing excess personnel" and "streamlining the organization" to lay off workers in large numbers to reap high profits. Women are particularly discriminated against; some factories first lay off women with many children, pregnant women who cannot work temporarily, and widows with difficult home lives. For example, Troshkova, a female worker at the "Revitalization" factory in Leningrad, worked there for nineteen years and raised three children alone. Because her children were sick and the nursery was quarantined, she could not work the night shift and was fired by the factory. The majority of the wages saved from laying off workers are put into the pockets of enterprise leaders under the name of "additional wages." Meanwhile, the masses of workers who are forcibly laid off are forced to wander in search of jobs.

		Exploitation takes many forms, child labor is heavy
Some lucky ones who are left behind are also anxious and uncertain. Enterprise leaders also use every means to increase their exploitation. Many factories order the remaining workers to "voluntarily" take on the work of those who have been laid off, with one person sometimes having to do the work of two or three. The national economic council of West Ural uses illegal methods such as moving or canceling workers' rest days, or extending working hours to exploit workers' labor. The director of the Ijesk Furniture Combine, Lushikov, made workers work 3,645 overtime hours in one year, but did not pay them a single kopeck. The leaders of the Perm Mining Machinery Factory did the same. Many factories also increased the exploitation of child labor, making them "engage in harmful work such as gas welding, battery work, and coppersmithing, and making them work as loaders." According to the Soviet "Labor Law," child labor is limited to six hours, but many factories, in order to make money, force child labor to work seven hours and increase their production quotas. Second-class lathe operator Sasha, an orphan with both parents deceased, had to complete 114% of the quota in one month.

		Arbitrary dismissal of workers, placing relatives everywhere
After the implementation of the "new system," due to the enterprise leaders' ability to freely hire and fire workers, there has been a serious turnover of labor. Soviet publications admit: "The state's industry and construction sites hire and fire millions of workers and employees every year." A mine in the northern part of the Soviet Union, Yakutia, "in one year, almost all personnel were replaced." The Almaty Housing Construction Company hired 1,489 people in 1965, but fired 1,152. The Ural Sewing Factory in the Kazakh Republic had a 51% turnover in one year. The leather factory in the same city even fired more people than it hired. According to Soviet newspapers, workers change so frequently that "enterprises have become corridors" and "bring considerable losses to the national economy," with the state suffering losses of 3 billion rubles every year.

While laying off large numbers of workers, some enterprise leaders use their power to place relatives and build family influence. Worker Patrukhov of the Alamil Worsted Factory in Sverdlovsk State exposed the "family rule" of the factory director Yevmenenko. He said that the director's nephew Nemchinov was appointed "production manager of weaving"; the wife of the director's nephew had long been the "chief norm setter." Many "major issues" of the factory were often decided by them at a "family meeting." The director and his wife could "use their own keys to open the factory entrance unguarded by anyone," and workers called this the "family key." The director of the Kamenets-Podolsk Parquet Flooring Combine under the Lviv National Economic Council, Ostyakov, promoted his wife, who had only the cultural level of a housewife, to the position of "economic engineer." This director also, despite the dissatisfaction of the majority of workers, arbitrarily used the "public funds allocated for the renovation of workers' housing" to expand his private residence.

		People strongly resist, Soviet revisionists panic
The "new system" of oppressing and exploiting workers is increasingly resisted by the Soviet working people. This makes the Soviet revisionist leadership uneasy, and they hurriedly issued a resolution in the name of the Central Committee of the CPSU last December, supposedly to strengthen labor discipline, and suppress the working class. The resolution complains that local authorities "have not effectively used social influence and legal measures," and calls for "cultivating a sense of responsibility in workers to accurately execute the commands and instructions of management agencies, and to promote and strengthen the principle of one-man rule in production management." The resolution also orders the strengthening of the role of Soviet supervisory agencies, the Supreme Court, and judicial inspection agencies. Subsequently, Soviet newspapers published numerous articles, advocating the need to "wage an uncompromising struggle against phenomena opposing the 'new system,'" and "to be good at using administrative measures prescribed by law," "to use administrative and economic measures"; but they also lament that "piles of warnings and orders" have produced "no effect at all." The Soviet revisionist leadership's intensified oppression and exploitation of the Soviet working class can only accelerate their own doom. (Xinhua News Agency, May 6)

### 苏修的工业“新体制”是资产阶级特权所有制

    苏修的工业“新体制”是资产阶级特权所有制
    苏修领导集团正在工业企业中推行的“新体制”，是进一步以资产阶级特权阶层的所有制代替社会主义的全民所有制，使广大职工沦为出卖劳动的雇佣奴隶。
    “新体制”赋予企业领导人更多和更大的特权。根据苏联官方有关的“条例”规定，一小撮企业领导人可以“不经委托即以企业名义办事”。他们有权支配生产资料和流动资金，可以擅自确定和改变职工的工资和奖金，有权自行招收、解雇和处罚工人，可以自行批准企业的结构和编制。苏联报纸大肆宣扬“新体制”是“在一长制的基础上实现企业管理”。
            “厂主”大权在握工人受尽欺压
    据苏联报刊透露，推行“新体制”的企业领导人“大权在握”，他们飞扬跋扈，说什么“我自己是自己的主人，想怎样干，就怎样干”。象资本主义企业一样，他们经常借口“裁减多余人员”和“紧缩编制”，大量解雇工人，以牟取高额利润。妇女特别受到歧视，有些工厂首先解雇多子女的女工、暂时不能工作的孕妇以及家中生活困难的寡妇。例如列宁格勒“复兴”工厂的女工特罗什科娃，在工厂里工作了十九年，有三个孩子，全部靠她抚养。由于孩子生病，托儿所隔离，她不能上夜班，就被工厂开除了。由于解雇工人而剩下来的工资的大部分，则以“附加工资”的名义，装进企业领导人的腰包。而大批大批被强行解雇的失业职工，却为生活所迫到处奔走，寻找职业。
          剥削名目繁多  童工劳动沉重
    一些侥幸被留下来的人，也是提心吊胆，朝不保夕。企业领导还千方百计地加重对他们的剥削。许多工厂勒令暂时留下的工人“自愿”代替被解雇人员的工作，一个人甚至要担负两个人到三个人的工作。西乌拉尔国民经济委员会所属的某些企业用非法挪移或取消工人的休息日，或延长工作时间的办法来剥削工人的劳动。伊热斯克家具联合工厂的厂长卢希科夫，在一年中让工人加班三千六百四十五个小时，但他连一个戈比也不给工人。彼尔姆采矿机器制造厂的领导也是如此。许多工厂还加重对童工的剥削，让他们“担任有损健康的工作，如瓦斯电焊工、电池工和铜匠，让他们当装卸工人”。按苏联“劳动法”规定，童工只劳动六小时，但很多工厂为了赚钱，都强迫童工劳动七小时，并增加他们的生产定额。二级旋工萨沙是一个双亲俱亡的孤儿，有一个月不得不完成定额的百分之一百一十四。
          任意解雇工人   处处安插亲信
    在推行“新体制”以后，由于企业领导人可以随便招收和解雇工人，造成了劳动力的严重流动。苏联报刊承认：“国家的工业和工地每年接收和解雇数百万工人和职员”。苏联北方雅库季里的一个矿场，“在一年内，实际上几乎全部人员都换过了”。阿拉木图房屋建筑公司在一九六五年共招收了一千四百八十九人，而开除的竟达一千一百五十二人。哈萨克共和国乌拉尔斯克缝纫厂的人员在一年内更换了百分之五十一。这个城市的皮革厂在同一时期甚至解雇的人比录用的还多。据苏联报纸透露，工人变动得这样厉害，“企业简直成了走廊”；“给国民经济带来不小的损失”，“国家每年所受损失达三十亿卢布”。
    在大批解雇职工的同时，一些企业领导人运用职权，安插亲信，培植家族势力。斯维尔德洛夫斯克州阿拉米利呢绒厂工人帕特鲁晓夫，揭露该厂经理叶夫缅因科“家天下的作风”。他说，经理的侄子涅姆奇诺夫担任“织布生产主任”；经理的侄子的妻子长期担任“主任定额员”。工厂的“许多重大问题”，常常由他们一家“开家庭会议来决定”。经理和他的妻子可以“用自己的钥匙打开没有任何人守卫的工厂入口”，工人们把这叫做“家庭钥匙”。利沃夫国民经济委员会所属卡缅斯克—布格壤木地板联合企业的经理奥斯佳科夫，把只有“家庭主妇文化水平”的妻子提升到“经济工程师”职位。这位经理还不顾广大工人的不满，擅自动用“拨给大修工人住房的公款”来扩建他的私宅。
          人民强烈抵制  苏修大为慌张
    压迫和剥削工人的“新体制”，受到苏联劳动人民日益强烈的抵制。这使苏修领导集团感到不安，慌忙于去年十二月以苏共中央的名义发表一个所谓关于加强劳动纪律的决议，对工人阶级实行镇压。决议埋怨地方“没有很好地利用社会影响和法律规定的行动措施”，叫嚷“要培养劳动者对准确执行管理机关的命令和指示的责任感，要发扬和加强管理生产方面的一长制原则”。决议还命令加强苏联监察机关、最高法院和司法视察机构的“作用”。接着苏联各报连篇累牍地发表文章，鼓吹要同反对“新体制”的现象“进行不调和的斗争”，“应该善于利用法律所规定的行政措施”，“运用行政和经济措施”；但是又哀叹“一叠一叠地发布警告命令”，并没有产生“任何感化作用”。苏修领导集团对苏联工人阶级加紧进行压迫和剥削，只能加速他们自己的灭亡。（新华社五日讯）
