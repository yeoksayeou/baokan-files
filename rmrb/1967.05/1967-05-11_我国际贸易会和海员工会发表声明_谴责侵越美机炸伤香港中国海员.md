	China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and China Ocean Shipping Company officials today spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, strongly condemning the heinous crime of American bandits savagely bombing the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the massive bombing of the port of Haiphong. They strongly protested the serious disruption of international normal trade and freedom of navigation by American imperialism, which resulted in the injury of six Hong Kong Chinese seamen.

	The officials said, on April 25, the bandit planes of American imperialism crazily bombed the port of Haiphong, hitting the British-registered cargo ship "Dafu" chartered by China, which was unloading cargo at the port. Six Hong Kong Chinese seamen on board were injured, and the lives of other crew members were also seriously threatened. We appeal to all upright people in the shipping industry around the world to jointly condemn this bandit act by American imperialism.

	The officials said, Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will inevitably make their last struggle against the revolutionary forces." The new serious crimes committed by American imperialism can only provoke broader and more intense resistance from the revolutionary people of the world, and can only "lift a rock to drop on one's own feet," and will certainly not end well.

	In discussing the British authorities' lack of response to the American imperialist bombing of the "Dafu" to date, the officials pointed out that ignoring the serious situation where international normal trade and navigation and loading and unloading are disrupted will also not end well.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, May 10, the All-China Seamen's Union today issued a statement, angrily denouncing the heinous crime of American imperialism's crazy bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong, which injured Hong Kong Chinese seamen, and expressing deep sympathy to the injured Hong Kong Chinese seamen and their families.

	The statement said, Chinese seamen are not to be trifled with. Chinese seamen, filled with revolutionary fighting spirit in the great proletarian cultural revolution, will surely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, together with all the people of China, be prepared to make the greatest national sacrifices, support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and national salvation, and forever stand together, fight together, and win together with the fraternal Vietnamese people.

    我国际贸易会和海员工会发表声明
    谴责侵越美机炸伤香港中国海员
    新华社十日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会和中国租船公司负责人今天对新华社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责美国强盗野蛮轰炸越南民主共和国领土和大规模轰炸海防港口的滔天罪行，强烈抗议美帝国主义严重破坏国际正常贸易和航行自由，炸伤六名香港中国海员的滔天罪行。
    负责人说，四月二十五日美帝国主义的强盗飞机疯狂轰炸海防港口，炸伤中国租用的、正在越南海防港卸货的英籍货轮“德福”号，致使船上的六名香港中国海员受伤，其他船员的生命安全也受到了严重的威胁。我们呼吁世界上所有正直的航运界人士，共同声讨美帝国主义的这一强盗行为。
    负责人说，毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的。”美帝国主义所犯下的新的严重罪行，只能促进世界革命人民的更广泛、更剧烈的反抗，只能“搬起石头打自己的脚”，绝不会有好下场。
    负责人在谈到英国有关当局对美帝国主义轰炸“德福”号迄今没有任何反应的时候指出，无视国际的正常贸易航行和装卸遭到破坏这一严重的局势，也是不会有好结果的。
    据新华社十日讯　中国海员工会全国委员会今天发表声明，愤怒声讨美帝国主义疯狂轰炸河内、海防，炸伤香港中国海员的滔天罪行，并向受伤的香港中国海员兄弟和他们的家属表示深切的慰问。
    声明说，中国海员不是好惹的。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中充满了革命战斗精神的中国海员，必将更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同全中国人民一起，决心准备承担最大的民族牺牲，支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，永远同兄弟的越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
