I will never, never forget the night of May 1, 1967. Under the illumination of colorful fireworks, the Tiananmen Gate was bathed in a red glow, and I saw our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

I am just an ordinary textile worker from Shanghai, a poor child who grew up picking coal in the old society. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and threw myself into this unprecedented struggle between the two classes to ensure our country does not change color. I and my comrades-in-arms faced severe tests and weathered the storm of the "January Revolution." In those difficult days, it was always Chairman Mao who timely pointed out the direction for us, giving us immense courage and strength. When we left Shanghai for Beijing on April 18, many comrades repeatedly urged me to convey their sentiments to Chairman Mao. We revolutionary fighters of the proletariat have so much to say to our great leader!

Now, this long-awaited moment has finally arrived. At 9:40, Chairman Mao walked towards us. Chairman Mao's body was so robust, his face ruddy. Right behind him was his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao. Comrade Vice Chairman Lin was also in good health, full of vigor. Chairman Mao shook my hand and posed for a photo with us. Holding his warm and strong hand, I was so moved that I could only say, "We, the workers of Shanghai and the 10 million people, sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life, a very long life!" Chairman Mao smiled and nodded to me repeatedly.

Comrade Vice Chairman Lin also shook my hand, and I said, "On behalf of the people of Shanghai, I wish Comrade Vice Chairman Lin good health forever!" Comrade Vice Chairman Lin humbly said, "Thank you!"

Chairman Mao continued to walk forward. I and Comrade Nie Yuanzi linked arms and closely followed Chairman Mao, shouting, "We follow Chairman Mao, we follow Chairman Mao!" Some comrades saw our excited state and laughed.

Chairman Mao walked steadily, occasionally stopping to shake hands with people, kindly asking about their health and work, showing such familiarity and care. When an older leader said he had not been feeling well recently, Chairman Mao repeatedly advised him to rest. Our great leader cares for and cherishes every revolutionary comrade. This went on until 11:07 at night when Chairman Mao finally went to rest.

Looking at Chairman Mao's towering figure, tears filled my eyes. I repeatedly told myself: I must forever remember this unforgettable moment, forever follow Chairman Mao, and follow Chairman Mao's teachings to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, building Shanghai into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The festive fireworks were colorful, and Tiananmen Square was bustling with excitement. The revolutionary masses of the capital held a grand celebration in Tiananmen Square to enthusiastically celebrate May 1, International Labor Day.

    永远紧跟毛主席
    上海市革命委员会代表团成员、上海国棉三十厂工人　王秀珍
    我永远永远不会忘记，一九六七年的“五一”之夜，在五彩缤纷的礼花映照得一片通红的天安门城楼上，我见到了最最敬爱的领袖毛主席。
    我，只是上海一个普通的纺织女工，一个在旧社会里靠捡煤核长大的苦孩子。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我按照毛主席的教导，为了使我们的国家不变颜色，投身到了这场史无前例的两个阶级的大搏斗中，我和战友们经受了严峻考验，迎接过“一月革命”的斗争风暴。在那些困难重重的日子里，总是毛主席及时给我们指明了航向，给了我们无比的勇气和力量。当四月十八日，我们离开上海来京的时候，多少战友一再叮嘱我，要求把他们的心意带给毛主席。我们无产阶级革命派战士有多少话要对我们的伟大领袖倾诉啊！
    如今，这个久已盼望的时刻终于来到了。九点四十分钟，毛主席向我们走来了。毛主席的身体是那么健壮，脸色红润。紧紧跟在他后面的是他的亲密战友林彪同志。林副主席的身体也很健康，精神焕发。毛主席和我握了手，还和我们一起照了相。我握着他那温暖而有力的手，激动得只说了一句：“我们上海工人阶级和一千万人民衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆”毛主席微笑着，连连向我点头。
    林副主席也和我握了手，我又说：“我代表上海人民祝林副主席身体永远健康！”林副主席谦逊地连说：“谢谢！”
    毛主席继续往前走。我和聂元梓同志挽住了臂膀，紧紧跟在毛主席后边，一边走，一边喊：“我们紧跟毛主席，我们紧跟毛主席！”有的同志看到我俩这种激动的样子，都笑了。
    毛主席迈着稳健的步子，一边走，一边不时地停下来和人们握手，亲切地问他们身体怎么样，工作怎么样，对他们是那么熟悉、关怀。当有一位年纪比较大的领导同志回答说他最近身体不大好的时候，毛主席就一再叮嘱他要注意休息。我们的伟大领袖对每一个革命同志都是那么关心，那么爱护。这样一直到深夜十一点零七分，毛主席才回去休息。
    我望着毛主席魁伟的身影，眼里含满了泪水，我一再对自己说：我一定要永远记住这段难忘的时刻，永远紧跟毛主席，按照毛主席的教导，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把上海建设成为一个毛泽东思想的大学校。（附图片）
