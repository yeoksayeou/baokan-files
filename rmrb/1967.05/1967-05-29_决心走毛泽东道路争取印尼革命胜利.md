Indonesian Students in China Hold Grand Meeting to Commemorate the 47th Anniversary of the Founding of the Indonesian Communist Party

On May 27, the Indonesian Students' Federation in China held a grand meeting in Beijing to celebrate the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party.

Members of the Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee delegation, Supeno, and Suar Surusso, a member of the National Committee of the Indonesian People's Youth League, attended the meeting along with friends from Indonesia in Beijing, including Chaharto.

Invited to attend the meeting were Chinese red diplomats Yao Denshan, Xu Ren, Shi Xingren, and Zhao Xiaoshou, 41 representatives of Indonesian-Chinese youth, and Wang Zhiyun, Chen Lu, and Zuo Guiyi, who were recently expelled by the Soviet revisionist authorities. The meeting was also attended by representatives of Japanese students and Vietnamese students.

The meeting began with the singing of "The East Is Red" and the Indonesian song "Praise to the Indonesian Communist Party." Everyone recited Chairman Mao's quote: "To make a revolution, it is necessary to have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

Sarmakhi, a representative of the Indonesian Students' Federation in China, spoke first at the commemorative meeting. He said, "At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has entered a new stage, in the world revolutionary base, in the boundless land of Mao Zedong Thought, we solemnly commemorate the 47th anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian Communist Party. This is a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line of Comrade Mao Zedong."

Sarmakhi severely condemned the fascist regime led by Suharto-Nasution for colluding with the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists to carry out extremely brutal suppression of the Indonesian revolutionary people. He said, "The Indonesian revolutionary people have come to realize from their struggle that as long as there is the slightest illusion about the peaceful path, as long as we deviate even slightly from the teachings of Chairman Mao, the revolution will suffer defeat. To achieve a thorough victory for the Indonesian revolution, we must follow the Chinese path. This means that the Mao Zedong path is the only path for the Indonesian revolution."

Sarmakhi enthusiastically praised the struggle of the Indonesian-Chinese. He said, "The Indonesian-Chinese have set a brilliant example of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, greatly inspiring the Indonesian people and making the Indonesian people even more daring and skilled in fighting against the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime. The revolutionary actions of the revolutionary comrades from Indonesia have powerfully proven that the fighting friendship between the peoples of Indonesia and China is unbreakable."

Suar spoke at the meeting, strongly condemning the Soviet modern revisionists for colluding with American imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries to suppress the Indonesian people's revolution. He said, "In the history of the international communist movement, there has never been a leadership group as despicable as the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the proletariat and colluding with anti-communist, anti-people regimes. They have destroyed the Indonesian Communist Party no less than the American imperialists."

Suar said, "The entire history of the working-class movement tells us that whether or not to acknowledge violent revolution as a universal law of the proletarian revolution, whether or not to acknowledge the necessity of smashing the old state machine, and whether or not to acknowledge the necessity of replacing bourgeois dictatorship with proletarian dictatorship, has always been the dividing line between Marxism and various opportunism and revisionism, between proletarian revolutionaries and all proletarian traitors. Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable, without which it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize power.' Indonesian communists have come to realize from their struggle that the Mao Zedong path is the only path for the Indonesian revolution, and that Mao Zedong Thought must be established throughout the entire Indonesian Communist Party."

Suar concluded, "The revolutionary youth of Indonesia must closely unite with the revolutionary youth of China, arm themselves with the most powerful ideological weapon, Mao Zedong Thought, to win the victory of the people's war to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist dictatorship."

Supeno spoke about the 47-year journey of the Indonesian Communist Party, saying, "The Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will wage people's war, build a people's army, establish base areas, and establish a revolutionary government, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and ultimately seizing the entire Indonesia. Practice has proven that the Mao Zedong path is the only correct path to victory for the Indonesian revolution."

Supeno said, "The experience of the Chinese people proves that without the leadership of Chairman Mao, it means disaster. On the contrary, uniting and advancing under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought means victory. This truth applies not only to the Chinese people but also to all the people of the world who are struggling."

Supeno strongly condemned the Suharto-Nasution reactionary government for its brutal suppression and exploitation of the Indonesian people, as well as its bloody suppression of the Indonesian-Chinese.

Supeno enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China ensures that China will forever be the invincible center of the world revolution."

Representatives of Japanese students in China and Chinese revolutionary Red Guards, along with 41 representatives of Indonesian-Chinese youth, spoke at the meeting. They warmly congratulated the Indonesian Communist Party on its 47th anniversary and warmly congratulated the Indonesian revolutionary people for finding the guiding light of Mao Zedong Thought and the correct path of armed struggle. They expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher together with the Indonesian revolutionary people and resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people.

Vietnamese students read a telegram of congratulations to the Indonesian Communist Party at the meeting.

The meeting was filled with a strong fighting atmosphere. During the speeches, people repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the Indonesian Communist Party! The Indonesian people will win! The Indonesian reactionaries will be defeated! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with Suharto and Nasution! Workers of the world, unite! The Mao Zedong path is the only correct path to victory for the Indonesian revolution! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao!"

The meeting ended with everyone singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "The Internationale."

    印尼在华学生集会隆重纪念印尼共产党成立四十七周年
    决心走毛泽东道路争取印尼革命胜利
    苏阿尔谴责苏修勾结美帝和印尼反动派镇压印尼人民革命
    据新华社二十八日讯　印度尼西亚在华学生联合会二十七日在北京隆重举行集会，庆祝印度尼西亚共产党成立四十七周年。
    印度尼西亚共产党中央代表团成员苏佩诺，印度尼西亚人民青年团全国委员会委员苏阿尔·苏罗梭，在京印尼朋友查禾多等参加了大会。
    应邀出席大会的有我国红色外交战士姚登山、徐仁、时兴仁、赵小寿，四十一个印尼华侨青少年代表以及最近被蒙修当局无理驱逐的王志云、陈禄、左贵义等。
    参加大会的还有日本留学生代表，越南留学生代表。
    大会开始，全体高唱《东方红》和印尼歌曲《歌颂印尼共产党》。全体朗读毛主席语录：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    印度尼西亚在华学生联合会代表沙尔玛基在纪念大会上首先讲话。他说，我们在中国无产阶级文化大革命进入了新的高潮的时刻，在世界革命的红色根据地，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的发源地，隆重纪念印度尼西亚共产党成立四十七周年，这是伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛泽东同志的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    沙尔玛基严厉谴责以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的法西斯政权，勾结美帝、苏修对印尼革命人民进行了极其残酷的镇压。他说，印尼革命人民从自己的斗争中认识到只要对和平道路存有一丝一毫的幻想，只要我们稍有一点背离了毛泽东主席的教导，革命就要遭受到失败。为了使印尼革命取得彻底胜利，必须走中国的道路。这就是说，毛泽东道路是印尼革命的唯一道路。
    沙尔玛基热烈赞扬了印尼华侨的斗争。他说，印尼华侨做出了活学活用毛泽东思想的光辉典范，极大地鼓舞了印尼人民，使印尼人民更加敢于、而且善于对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权进行斗争。革命华侨同志们的革命行动有力地证明了印尼中国两国人民的战斗友谊是牢不可破的。
    苏阿尔在大会上讲话，他强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义勾结美帝国主义和印尼反动派镇压印尼人民革命。他说，在国际共产主义运动史上，还未曾出现过象苏修领导集团那样卑鄙地背叛无产阶级，同反共反人民的政权勾结。他们破坏印尼共产党并不亚于美帝国主义。
    苏阿尔说，工人阶级运动的整个历史告诉我们，承认不承认暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，承认不承认粉碎旧的国家机器的必要性，承认不承认由无产阶级专政去代替资产阶级专政的必要性，永远是马克思主义同形形色色的机会主义、修正主义，无产阶级革命家同一切无产阶级叛徒之间的分水岭。毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”印尼共产党人从斗争中认识到，毛泽东道路是印尼革命的唯一道路，要使毛泽东思想确立在整个印尼共产党队伍中。
    苏阿尔最后说，印尼的革命青年要紧密地同中国革命青年团结在一起，用战无不胜的最强大的思想武器毛泽东思想武装自己，以赢得推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯独裁统治的人民战争的胜利。
    苏佩诺在讲话中谈到了印尼共产党的四十七年所走过的曲折道路以后说，印尼人民，在以毛泽东思想武装起来的印尼共产党的领导下，将开展人民战争，将建立工农军队，将建立根据地，建立革命政权，以农村包围城市而最后夺回整个印度尼西亚。实践证明，毛泽东的道路是印尼革命取得胜利的唯一正确的道路。
    苏佩诺说，中国人民的经验证明，离开了毛主席的领导就意味着灾难。反之，在毛泽东思想光辉旗帜下团结起来前进，就意味着胜利。这个真理不仅适用于中国人民，也适用于全世界正在斗争的人民。
    苏佩诺强烈谴责苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动政府对印尼人民的残酷镇压和剥削，以及对印尼华侨的血腥镇压。
    苏佩诺热情地赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命保证中国永远是不可战胜的世界革命的中心。
    日本在中国的留学生代表和中国革命红卫兵代表、四十一个印尼华侨青少年代表等先后在大会上讲话。他们热烈祝贺印尼共产党成立四十七周年，热烈祝贺印尼革命人民找到了毛泽东思想的指路明灯，找到了武装斗争的正确道路。他们表示，决心和印尼革命人民一起更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争。
    越南留学生在大会上宣读了给印尼共产党的贺电。
    大会充满强烈战斗气氛。讲话过程中人们不断振臂高呼：“印尼共产党万岁！”“印尼人民必胜！印尼反动派必败！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“打倒苏哈托、纳苏蒂安！”“全世界无产者联合起来！”“毛泽东的道路是印尼革命胜利的唯一正确道路！”“中国共产党万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“世界革命的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    大会结束时，全体高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《国际歌》。
