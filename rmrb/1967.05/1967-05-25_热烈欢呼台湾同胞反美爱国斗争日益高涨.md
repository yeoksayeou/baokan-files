Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters and Beijing Branch Hold Meeting to Commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the "5·24" Mass Protest by Taiwan People

The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters and Beijing Branch held a meeting today to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the "5·24" anti-American, patriotic mass protest by the people of Taiwan Province. Taiwanese compatriots and Red Guards present warmly celebrated the great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They wished our great leader Chairman Mao a long life. The attendees strongly condemned the heinous crimes of American imperialism in occupying our territory of Taiwan and expressed firm support for the just anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Taiwanese people. They solemnly declared: The Chinese people must liberate their own territory of Taiwan and will never allow the American bandits to turn Taiwan into a base for invading mainland China and Asia.

National People's Congress representative and member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters, Tian Fuda, presided over today's meeting.

Secretary-General Xu Mengshan of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Headquarters spoke at the meeting. He said, ten years ago today, the people of Taiwan rebelled against American imperialism, and this rebellion was well done. We firmly support it! Today, we commemorate this day in the midst of the great Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in our motherland, precisely to firmly support the Taiwanese people in rebelling against American imperialism, the KMT bandits, revisionism, and all reactionaries. American imperialism is the sworn enemy of all Chinese people. American imperialism's aggression and the KMT bandits' dark rule are the root of all disasters for the Taiwanese people. American imperialism is rapidly expanding airports and ports in Taiwan, increasing its invading troops, attempting to turn Taiwan into a military base for invading mainland China, Vietnam, and the entire Southeast Asia. At the same time, American imperialism is intensifying its economic plunder and cultural invasion of Taiwan, bringing heavy disasters to the Taiwanese compatriots.

After strongly condemning American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan, Xu Mengshan said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." Over the past year, under the great guidance of Chairman Mao's "Rebellion is justified," and inspired by the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat on the mainland, the Taiwanese compatriots, despite the KMT's secret police rule, have written and posted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao" and "American imperialism, get out of Taiwan" in various cities and rural areas in Taiwan. They have loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations and engaged in brave struggles against the KMT reactionaries. Incidents of beating American military and political personnel and destroying KMT "official" buildings have frequently occurred. All these show that under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a new wave of anti-American, patriotic struggle is forming in Taiwan. We warmly celebrate the rising anti-American, patriotic struggle of the Taiwanese compatriots and express our most resolute support for them!

Xu Mengshan concluded by saying, today we commemorate this glorious day, the 10th anniversary of the "5·24" anti-American, patriotic mass protest by the Taiwanese people, we must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, better respond to Chairman Mao's great call, contribute all our efforts to thoroughly fight and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end, and to liberate Taiwan.

Members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Standing Committee member Su Zihuan, member Chen Wenbin, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Chen Bingji, and Red Guards also spoke at the meeting. They expressed deep indignation at American imperialism's occupation of our territory and their hometown. They warmly celebrated the new victories of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to contribute to the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the liberation of Taiwan. They also expressed their firm support for the heroic Hong Kong compatriots' struggle against suppression.

    台盟总部和北京支部集会纪念台湾人民“五·二四”大示威十周年
    热烈欢呼台湾同胞反美爱国斗争日益高涨
    台湾同胞不顾美蒋特务统治，在各地书写张贴“毛主席万岁”“美帝国主义从台湾滚出去”等标语，高声朗读毛主席语录，同美蒋反动派进行英勇斗争。
    据新华社二十四日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部和北京支部今天举行集会，纪念台湾省人民“五·二四”反美爱国大示威十周年。到会的台湾省籍同胞和红卫兵小将热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，敬祝我们伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆。到会的人们强烈谴责美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾的滔天罪行，表示坚决支持台湾人民的反美爱国正义斗争。他们庄严表示：中国人民一定要解放自己的领土台湾，绝不允许美国强盗把台湾变成侵略中国大陆和侵略亚洲的基地。
    全国人大代表、台盟总部理事田富达主持了今天的集会。
    台盟总部秘书长徐萌山在会上讲话。他说，十年前的今天，台湾人民造了美帝国主义的反，这个反造得好，我们坚决支持！今天，我们在祖国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中来纪念这个日子，就是要坚决支持台湾人民造美帝国主义的反，造蒋介石匪帮的反，造修正主义的反，造一切反动派的反。美帝国主义是全中国人民不共戴天的死敌。美帝国主义的侵略和蒋匪帮的黑暗统治，是台湾人民一切灾难的根源。美帝国主义在台湾大肆扩建机场、军港，大量增加侵略军，企图把台湾变成它侵略我国大陆、侵略越南和整个东南亚的军事基地。与此同时，美帝国主义还日益加紧对台湾的经济掠夺和文化侵略，给台湾同胞带来了沉重的灾难。
    徐萌山在强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略台湾的罪行以后说，毛主席教导我们：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只能通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”去年以来，台湾同胞在毛主席
  “造反有理”的伟大教导下，在祖国大陆无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，不顾美蒋的特务统治，在台湾城乡各地书写“毛主席万岁”和“美帝国主义从台湾滚出去”等标语，高声朗诵毛主席语录，同美蒋反动派进行了英勇斗争。痛打美国军政人员、捣毁蒋匪帮“官府”的事件也不断发生。所有这些都说明，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，一个新的反美爱国斗争的运动正在台湾形成。我们热烈欢呼台湾同胞反美爱国斗争的日益高涨，并对他们表示最坚决的支持！
    徐萌山最后说，今天我们纪念台湾人民“五·二四”反美爱国大示威十周年这个光荣的日子，一定要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己，更好地响应毛主席的伟大号召，为彻底斗倒斗臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，为解放台湾贡献出自己的一切力量。
    政协全国委员会常委苏子蘅、委员陈文彬，台盟北京市支部主任委员陈炳基以及红卫兵小将们也先后在会上发言。他们对美帝国主义霸占祖国的领土和自己的家乡表示无比的愤慨，他们热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，表示一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，为无产阶级文化大革命的胜利和解放台湾做出新的贡献。他们还表示坚决支持英雄的香港爱国同胞的反迫害斗争。
