Edition: 2

In the midst of the great revolutionary situation where the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people are enthusiastically celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and are rising up to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party as its backer, the three revolutionary classics "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art," and "Poems of Chairman Mao" have been reprinted by the People's Literature Publishing House and will soon be distributed nationwide.

The New China News Agency reported on the 15th that during this period of intense revolutionary struggle, the People's Literature Publishing House has reprinted "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art," and "Poems of Chairman Mao." These three revolutionary classics will soon be distributed nationwide.

The newly published standalone edition of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" includes an appendix of the editorial note "The Compass of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution" from the ninth issue of "Red Flag" magazine in 1966, which reprinted "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The book "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" compiles Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," parts of "On New Democracy," parts of "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Mao Zedong's speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China, and other discussions by Mao Zedong on culture and art. This reprint includes Mao Zedong's letter on the "Issue of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' Research" written on October 16, 1954. The "Publisher's Note" of the new edition of "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" states: "These brilliant discussions most completely, most comprehensively, and most systematically summarize the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front. They geniusly and creatively develop Marxism-Leninism worldview and literary theory, reaching the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism worldview and literary theory, and are epoch-making important documents. They are the most complete, most thorough, and most correct Marxist-Leninist literary line, the programmatic document of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the highest directive for proletarian cultural and artistic work."

A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists entrenched in the cultural publishing industry, along with the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party backing them, have consistently obstructed the publication of Chairman Mao's works. They have adopted counter-revolutionary methods of resistance and obstruction towards the printing of Chairman Mao's discussions on literary work. In 1962, during the 20th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and the old People's Literature Publishing House, led by a small clique of capitalist-roaders, released a frenzy of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, fiercely resisting the publication of Chairman Mao's works. Under the pressure of the revolutionary masses, it was not until two or three months after the 20th anniversary that they were forced to print 10,000 copies of "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art."

Since the launch of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries of the People's Literature Publishing House, along with the broad revolutionary workers in the literary and artistic circles, have overturned the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural publishing industry, seized their power, and taken on the most glorious task of publishing Chairman Mao's works. From 1958 to June 1966, the People's Literature Publishing House printed a total of 5.26 million copies of "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art" and "Poems of Chairman Mao." However, from July 1966 to the present, in just ten months, they have printed 22.65 million copies, which is four times the total number printed in the eight years before the Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the revolutionary people of the entire nation are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought for revolutionary criticism, launching a deep and thorough criticism of the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party. The proletarian revolutionaries and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, armed with Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other brilliant discussions on culture and art, are fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line and its backer. To provide the strongest ideological weapon for the literary warriors on the front lines and the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres, the proletarian revolutionaries of the People's Literature Publishing House, along with the revolutionary workers of the publishing and printing systems in Beijing and Shanghai, have, on the day of celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," with boundless love for Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party, spared no effort to rush-print the three revolutionary classics "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Mao Zedong on Literature and Art," and "Poems of Chairman Mao."

    为无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众提供最强大的革命批判武器
    毛主席关于文艺的光辉论著重新出版
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》《毛泽东论文艺》《毛主席诗词》即将在全国各地发行
    新华社十五日讯　在无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众热烈欢庆毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，奋起批判以党内头号走资本主义道路当权派为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺路线的大好革命形势下，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《毛泽东论文艺》和《毛主席诗词》三本革命宝书，已经由人民文学出版社重新出版，即将在全国各地发行。
    这次出版的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》单行本，附录了《红旗》杂志一九六六年第九期重新发表《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》时的按语《无产阶级文化大革命的指南针》一文。《毛泽东论文艺》一书，辑录了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《新民主主义论》（部分）、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》（部分）、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》和毛主席有关文化艺术的其他论述；这次再版增加了毛主席在一九五四年十月十六日所写的《关于〈红楼梦研究〉问题的一封信》。新版《毛泽东论文艺》的《出版说明》指出：“这些光辉的论述，最完整、最全面、最系统地总结了文化战线上两条路线的斗争，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，是当代马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的最高峰，是划时代的重要文献。它是最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，是无产阶级的文化艺术工作的最高指示。”
    盘踞在文化出版界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子和在背后支持他们的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一贯阻挠出版毛主席著作，他们对印行毛主席关于文艺工作的论著，同样采取了抵制、阻挠的反革命手段。一九六二年，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的时候，旧中宣部、旧文化部和旧人民文学出版社内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，却大放封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒草出笼，疯狂地抵制毛主席著作的出版。在革命群众的压力下，直到这篇讲话二十周年过后的两三个月，他们才不得不出版了一万册《毛泽东论文艺》。
    无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，人民文学出版社的无产阶级革命派和文艺界广大革命职工一起，造了文化出版界一小撮反革命修正主义分子的反，夺了他们的权，担负起了出版毛主席著作这一最光荣的任务。从一九五八年到一九六六年六月，人民文学出版社一共只印《毛泽东论文艺》和《毛主席诗词》五百二十六万册，而从一九六六年七月到现在，短短的十个月时间，就印了二千二百六十五万册，为无产阶级文化大革命前八年中的总印数的四倍。
    目前，全国革命人民高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，正在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开深入的彻底的批判。无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，以毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛主席有关文化艺术的其他光辉论著为武器，狠狠批判反革命修正主义文艺路线和它的总后台。为了给战斗在第一线的文艺战士和广大的工农兵、革命师生、革命干部提供最强大的思想武器，人民文学出版社的无产阶级革命派和首都、上海出版印刷系统的广大革命职工一起，在欢庆《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的日子里，怀着对毛主席的无限热爱和对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的刻骨仇恨，全力以赴，赶印《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《毛泽东论文艺》和《毛主席诗词》三本革命宝书。
