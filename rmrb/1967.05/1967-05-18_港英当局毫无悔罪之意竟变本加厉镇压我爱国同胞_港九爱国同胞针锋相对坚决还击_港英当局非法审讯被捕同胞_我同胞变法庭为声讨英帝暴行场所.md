The British authorities in Hong Kong, showing no remorse, have intensified their suppression of our patriotic compatriots. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon have responded with resolute counterattacks. The British authorities in Hong Kong have conducted illegal trials of arrested compatriots, and our compatriots have turned the court into a platform to denounce the atrocities of the British Empire.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 17th: Today, the situation in Hong Kong continues to deteriorate. The British authorities in Hong Kong have shown no sincerity in easing the severe situation. In the evening, gunshots from wooden bullets were heard frequently in Kowloon. The British water police and various police vehicles were dispatched, and new bloody atrocities occurred.

At 11 AM today, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee sent 17 representatives to the British "Government House" to strongly protest against the heinous crimes committed by the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong against our compatriots in various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Governor David Trench refused to meet with the representatives, showing no sincerity in easing the severe situation he himself has created.

Today, the British "Government House" was surrounded by military and police, with the gates tightly closed. Inside the "Government House," a large number of military and police were hiding, occasionally peeking out. When the representatives from various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon arrived at the British "Government House," David Trench ordered one of his "aides" to refuse them entry at the gate, which greatly infuriated the representatives.

Today, tens of thousands of people gathered near the Po Leung Kuk Theatre on Nathan Road in Kowloon to protest against the British "court's" illegal trial of our innocent arrested compatriots. The British authorities once again dispatched a large number of "riot police" to brutally suppress the crowd, intensifying their beatings and arbitrary arrests of our compatriots, and firing "riot bullets" and tear gas. Facing the enemy's fascist atrocities, our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon bravely fought back for several hours.

Recently, the British authorities in Hong Kong have taken various measures, colluding with American and Kuomintang agents to persecute our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. According to newspaper reports, the Kuomintang "Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions" held a meeting on the 15th under the protection of the British authorities, establishing the so-called "Committee for the Protection of Labor Safety" to "firmly support" the British authorities' bloody suppression of our patriotic compatriots. The current situation shows that after the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued the most urgent and strongest protest to the British government on the 15th, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong not only showed no remorse but also continued to escalate the situation, further suppressing our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The compatriots in various sectors of Hong Kong and Kowloon have made preparations, warning the British authorities: if you dare to escalate the persecution, we are prepared to fight you to the end in any place.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 17th: The British authorities in Hong Kong dared to ignore the most urgent and strongest protest statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, conducting illegal trials of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers and compatriots arrested in the anti-violence struggle on the 15th and 16th.

On the 16th, when the British authorities conducted illegal trials of 20 innocent arrested workers from a Hong Kong artificial flower factory at the "Southern Kowloon Magistrates' Court," they were on high alert, deploying a large number of police and agents inside and outside the "court," dispatching helicopters and police cars, and closing the "court" doors early to keep hundreds of people outside.

The "court" opened at 10:30 AM. The spectators and those in the corridors held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wore Mao badges, all with high spirits. As soon as the British "judge" entered, the crowd inside and outside the door immediately shouted, "Protest against closed-door trials!" The "judge" frantically banged the table, attempting to suppress the crowd's voices, but this only provoked stronger protests. The "judge" had to announce the adjournment of the court less than 30 seconds after the opening, and later announced a postponement to 2:30 PM.

The crowd inside and outside the "court" gathered together, immediately turning the "court" into a platform to denounce the British authorities' bloody suppression of Chinese compatriots. Slogans and revolutionary songs echoed inside the "court." A young man stood up and loudly read the protest statement issued by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on the 15th. The crowd, moved, repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Firmly support the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" They repeatedly sang "The East Is Red."

When the court reopened in the afternoon, the British authorities further played tricks, closing the iron gates of the "Southern Kowloon Magistrates' Court" and deploying more police for security, attempting to conduct illegal secret trials. The cowardly behavior of the British authorities infuriated the broad masses of Hong Kong, and thousands of people rushed from all directions to protest the illegal trials. Due to the strong support of the people of our motherland and the resolute struggle of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, the British "court" was forced to announce the release and "bail pending trial" of some innocent arrested workers. However, more than 300 Chinese compatriots are still illegally detained by the British authorities.

    港英当局毫无悔罪之意竟变本加厉镇压我爱国同胞
    港九爱国同胞针锋相对坚决还击
    港英当局非法审讯被捕同胞　我同胞变法庭为声讨英帝暴行场所
    据新华社香港十七日电　今天，香港局势继续恶化。港英当局毫无诚意缓和严重局势。傍晚，九龙方面不时传来木弹枪声，港英当局的水警和大小警车纷纷出动，发生了新的血腥暴行。
    今天上午十一时，港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会派出十七位代表前往港英“总督府”，就英国政府和港英当局对我港九各界同胞犯下的滔天罪行，向港英“总督”戴麟趾提出最强烈抗议。戴麟趾拒不接见代表，毫无诚意缓和当前由于他一手造成的严重局势。
    今天上午，港英“总督府”外面军警林立，大门紧闭。“总督府”内还埋伏着大批军警，不时探头出来张望。当港九各界同胞代表到达港英“总督府”时，戴麟趾竟吩咐他的一个“副官”把代表们拒于大门之外，激起了代表们极大的愤慨。
    今天上午，成千上万的群众汇集在九龙弥敦道普庆戏院附近，抗议港英“法庭”非法审讯我无辜被捕同胞。港英当局又一次派出大批“防暴队”，对群众进行疯狂的血腥镇压，变本加厉地毒打和滥捕我同胞，并发射了“防暴弹”和催泪瓦斯弹。面对着敌人的法西斯暴行，我港九同胞英勇地进行了几个小时的反击。
    最近以来，港英当局还采取种种措施，勾结美蒋特务对我港九爱国同胞进行迫害。据报纸报道，蒋匪帮“港九工团联合总会”十五日在港英当局纵容包庇下举行会议，成立了所谓“维护劳工安全委员会”，“坚决支持”港英当局对我爱国同胞进行血腥镇压。目前情况表明，在我国外交部十五日向英国政府提出了最紧急、最强烈的抗议之后，英国政府和港英当局不仅毫无悔罪之意，而且继续扩大事态，对我港九同胞进一步进行镇压。港九各界同胞已作好准备，他们警告港英当局：你们胆敢把迫害升级，我们也准备在任何一个地方跟你们斗争到底。
    据新华社香港十七日电　香港英国当局胆敢无视我国外交部提出的最紧急、最强烈的抗议声明，在十五、十六日连续两天对在抗暴斗争中被捕的港九工人和同胞进行非法审讯。
    十六日，港英当局在“南九龙裁判署”非法审讯二十名无辜被捕的香港人造花厂工人的时候，如临大敌，预先在“法庭”内外布置了大批警察和特务，出动了直升飞机和警车，并且很早便把“法庭”的门关起来，把数百名群众挡在门外。
    “法庭”在上午十时半开庭。旁听席和走廊上的群众手里都拿着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，胸前佩戴着毛主席像章，个个情绪激昂。港英当局“法官”一进场，门内门外的群众立即高呼：“抗议关门审讯！”“法官”疯狂地猛拍桌子，妄图把群众的声音压下去，但却引起群众更强烈的抗议。“法官”在开庭后不到三十秒钟便不得不宣布退庭，稍后又宣布延至下午二时半再开庭。
    “法庭”内外的群众汇集在一起，立刻把“法庭”变成声讨港英当局血腥镇压中国同胞罪行的场所。“法庭”上口号声和革命歌声此起彼落。一位青年站出来高声朗读了我国外交部十五日发表的抗议声明。群众激动地一遍又一遍振臂高呼：“坚决拥护我国外交部声明！”“中国共产党万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    下午开庭的时候，港英当局竟进一步玩弄阴谋诡计，把“南九龙裁判署”的铁门关闭，加派警察戒备，妄图实行非法的秘密审讯。港英当局的怯懦行为激起了香港广大同胞的愤怒，数千名群众从四面八方奔来抗议非法审讯。由于祖国人民的有力支持和香港中国同胞的坚决斗争，港英“法庭”被迫宣布释放和“假释候审”一些无辜被捕的工人。但至今仍有三百多名中国同胞被港英当局非法囚禁。
