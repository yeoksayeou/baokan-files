As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is shaking the world, continues to achieve victories in our country, we commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This has special and profound significance. This brilliant work comprehensively embodies Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line and thoroughly and profoundly solves a series of fundamental issues for the development of proletarian literature and art. Over the past 25 years, through struggles with various forms of bourgeois and revisionist literary thoughts, Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art has shone even more brilliantly. It is not only a guiding light for the broad masses of literary and artistic workers and intellectuals to reform their thoughts and promote the revolutionization of their thinking, but also a powerful ideological weapon for the broad revolutionary people in the ideological domain to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements, to oppose and prevent revisionism, and to prevent the restoration of capitalism. This great work is the highest directive and highest program for the development of proletarian literary and artistic undertakings, and the pinnacle of contemporary Marxist-Leninist literary theory. In our country's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has even more fully demonstrated the great significance and combat power of this work.

In recent years, our revolutionary literary and artistic workers have had a deep realization: no matter what the circumstances, as long as we act according to the directives of this work, we will be invincible; otherwise, we will make mistakes and even become captives of bourgeois and revisionist literary thoughts. Therefore, supporting or opposing Chairman Mao's "Talks" is one of the marks distinguishing revolutionaries from counter-revolutionaries, true revolutionaries from false revolutionaries. Each of us revolutionary literary and artistic workers should, in practice, study and apply Chairman Mao's "Talks," and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art in our hearts. Only in this way can we truly become stalwart proletarian literary and artistic warriors.

I

Since the founding of New China, the literary and artistic circles have always been a battleground for the sharp struggle between two lines. In June 1964, our great leader Chairman Mao, in an extremely important instruction to the literary and artistic departments, said: "These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones), over the past fifteen years, have basically (not everyone) not implemented the Party's policies, acted like officials and lords, not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even slipped to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably, on some future day, become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary." Why have most of our literary and artistic departments and organizations not been able to implement Chairman Mao's highest directive in his "Talks" and act according to Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art? The fundamental reason is that from the central to the local levels, there has been a literary and artistic black line opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. This black line serves the restoration of capitalism, and its representatives are a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Luo Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan, with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party as their backer.

The literary and artistic circles in Shanghai, like those in the rest of the country, have also witnessed a sharp and complex struggle between two lines over the past seventeen years since liberation. In 1962, our country suffered three consecutive years of natural disasters, and the Soviet revisionist leadership imposed economic pressure on us in bad faith. In this situation of intensified class struggle at home and abroad, the literary and artistic circles in Shanghai, like those in the rest of the country, also experienced a black wind. A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, taking advantage of the illness of Comrade Ke Qingshi, who was resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, accelerated the promotion of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, refusing to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. They launched fierce attacks on Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line from both ideological and organizational aspects:

First, they vigorously promoted feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literary trash in the realm of literary thought. The stage was filled with performances of emperors, generals, and scholars, and even ghost plays and yellow plays were presented as "traditional programs," such as "Li Huimang," "Half a Pair of Scissors," "Killing the Son for Revenge," and "The Lady's Fan." Films promoted the inheritance of the "traditions" of the 1930s, spending lavishly to shoot films like "Stage Sisters." Literature also promoted "big," "foreign," "ancient," and "feudal," "bourgeois," "revisionist" elements. Newspapers and magazines discussed so-called "spirit," "literary style," and "style" divorced from political content, quoting extensively from "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" without mentioning Chairman Mao's "Talks" even once. They propagated the theory of "ghosts do no harm," promoted works of bourgeois low taste, and works of revisionist class reconciliation and superclass human nature, leading to a surge of works that used ancient times to satirize the present, and opposed the Party and socialism. They did this to resist Chairman Mao's highest directive in his "Talks" and to prevent Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art from establishing absolute authority in the literary and artistic circles, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Second, to resist the proletarian revolutionaries from implementing Chairman Mao's highest directive in his "Talks" and to promote the revisionist literary line, they recruited and accommodated traitors organizationally, seizing territory and vying for leadership from the proletarian revolutionaries. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Shanghai's literary and artistic circles, following the black directives of their "ancestor" Zhou Yang, launched a fierce attack in 1962, criticizing the Party for "neglecting the cultivation of intellectuals" and demanding the organization of an "old guard." During the second Shanghai Literary and Art Workers' Congress, they collected and developed into members of various associations those anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois "authorities," revisionists, "old timers" from the 1930s, feudal remnants, and reactionary literati, appointing them as committee members of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and giving them "speaking rights." With their "speaking rights," there was no room for the proletarian revolutionaries to speak, making it easier for them to promote the revisionist literary line.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." The struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the literary and artistic front is ultimately a struggle for power, a struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for seizing and counter-seizing power. In the departments and organizations where this small clique of revisionists had usurped power, water could not seep in, and needles could not be inserted. Only their bourgeois and revisionist schemes were allowed, and we were not allowed to act according to Chairman Mao's "Talks" and promote proletarian schemes; only their feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literary thoughts were allowed to be spread, and we were not allowed to propagate Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. They brazenly carried out anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong literary thought activities, making the literary and artistic circles a mess. The Shanghai Writers' Association, known as the "Shanghai branch of Zhou Yang's black den," not only had their "big boss" Ye Yiqun (a traitor to the Party) but also their "second boss" Kong Luoxuan (a reactionary official from the Kuomintang). They dared to defy Chairman Mao's words but obeyed Zhou Yang's orders. According to Zhou Yang's black directives, they established a whole set of revisionist systems, allowing these lords to live a luxurious "high-level life," rarely contacting the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. In 1962, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles established an art hall. The former secretary of the Federation, Kong Luoxuan, formulated a revisionist purpose for this hall, "meeting friends through literature," without Party political leadership, opening the door wide for ghosts and snakes, providing conditions for their activities. Western films, revisionist films, and yellow reactionary publications flooded the place, and hoodlums roamed freely, turning it into a place to corrupt young literary and artistic workers.

During this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was also exposed that a person who was once praised by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan as a "great writer with international influence since the May Fourth Movement" and a "leftist old intellectual who has always been close to the Party" ××, was the most typical bourgeois spiritual "nobleman." He had nearly 300,000 yuan in cash, more than ten various types of transistor radios, lived in a three-story garden villa with a large lawn, large living room, and large study, luxurious and magnificent. He lived a life of a parasite and a bloodsucker, but wrote anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds, even going so far as to write poisonous articles for the United Press International and the Taiwan "Central Daily News" to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and oppose Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao warned them as early as 25 years ago in his "Talks": "Your way is no good, the proletariat cannot indulge you, if we follow you, it is actually following the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there is the danger of the Party and the country perishing."

With the support of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, the revisionist literary black line represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan in Shanghai was resisted and fought against by the proletarian revolutionaries who resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, represented by Comrade Ke Qingshi. Under Chairman Mao's personal instruction, Comrade Ke Qingshi came out despite his illness to fight resolutely against this counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line in the literary and artistic circles. On New Year's Day 1963, Comrade Ke Qingshi, according to Chairman Mao's highest directive in his "Talks" and the spirit of the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, pointed out to the literary and artistic workers in Shanghai, in response to Zhou Yang and Xia Yan's advocacy of the 1930s, the initiative to reflect the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers—"write about the thirteen years." This revolutionary initiative embodied Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line and was a direct counterattack against the literary black line. It immediately faced opposition from the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and a small clique of revisionists in the literary and artistic circles represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan. In Shanghai, Zhou Yang's subordinate, Ye Yiqun, also responded. In the second issue of "Shanghai Literature" in 1963, he published an article titled "Reflecting Contemporary Life and Promoting Socialism," waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, openly calling for the inheritance of the "traditions" of the 1930s, slandering Comrade Ke Qingshi's initiative to write about the thirteen years as "cutting off revolutionary history," insisting on writing about the past and the old society, arrogantly continuing to pave the way for feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literature.

Comrade Ke Qingshi insisted on implementing Chairman Mao's highest directive in his "Talks" and insisted on the initiative to "write about the thirteen years." He also personally oversaw the East China Drama Festival, proposing to perform modern socialist plays that reflect the struggle of workers, peasants, and soldiers. At that time, I also participated in the creation of two plays that reflect the struggle of the working class in the socialist period. Comrade Ke Qingshi, despite his illness, watched our rehearsals many times, proposed modifications to the script, and even revised the lines word by word. After listening to Comrade Jiang Qing's opinions, Comrade Ke Qingshi also organized articles to criticize the theory of "ghosts do no harm." Comrade Ke Qingshi, despite his hard work, insisted on implementing the spirit of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line, which is worth learning from by every revolutionary literary and artistic worker.

At this time, the Zhou Yang clique did not stop. They immediately launched a propaganda machine to attack Comrade Ke Qingshi's initiative. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Shanghai's literary and artistic circles, such as Ye Yiqun, also shouted to implement Zhou Yang's so-called "central spirit." Chairman Mao taught us in his "Talks": "Ancient and foreign literary works are not the source but the flow." However, Ye Yiqun openly opposed the spirit of Chairman Mao's "Talks," proposing to implement the spirit of "one hand reaching out to the ancients and one hand reaching out to foreigners," proposing to implement the spirit of "three-legged walking" for modern plays, traditional plays, and historical plays. The Zhou Yang and Xia Yan clique also responded in Beijing, attacking Comrade Ke Qingshi in various occasions. Of course, they were actually attacking Chairman Mao's "Talks" and Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line. Look! How arrogant the counter-revolutionary revisionists were in opposing Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art!

"Only heroes can drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes afraid of bears and tigers." The proletarian revolutionaries who insist on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line launched a general offensive against this literary black line in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and exposed its backer—the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. We must thoroughly criticize this thick and long revisionist literary black line and let the boundless flames of Mao Zedong Thought occupy all literary and artistic positions!

II

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In our country, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, anti-Marxist ideology, will long exist.... The question of who will win in the ideological struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has not been truly resolved. We must continue to struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. Not understanding this situation and giving up ideological struggle is wrong." We must be soberly aware that due to the long-term control of the revisionist literary black line, many people in the literary and artistic circles have been poisoned to varying degrees by feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literary thoughts. Even within our leftist ranks, some comrades have been influenced by some "feudal," "bourgeois," and "revisionist" things in recent years. Especially, some comrades have been influenced by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's "Self-Cultivation," with a serious tendency towards slavery, idolizing those "authorities" dressed in communist cloaks, and not being able to identify Zhou Yang's revisionist literary thought with Mao Zedong Thought, often blindly "listening" and "obeying," thus allowing the enemy to enter their minds. On the 25th anniversary of the "Talks," we must use Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art to examine ourselves and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art in the hearts of each of us in various literary and artistic departments and organizations.

"Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." To establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, we must first destroy the revisionist literary thought and the revisionist systems existing in literary and artistic departments and organizations. The tasks of destruction in front of us are quite arduous. The struggle, criticism, and reform in the literary and artistic circles are issues of destruction and construction. Destruction must first be done ideologically; construction must also first be done ideologically. Destruction is not small destruction, medium destruction, but must be great destruction. Great destruction is to carry out great criticism, to use Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art to thoroughly and comprehensively criticize the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, and to criticize feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literary thoughts. Only through great destruction can we establish great construction. Only by thoroughly destroying these messy things can we establish Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line. The absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art is established and developed in the continuous struggle against the bourgeois and revisionist literary thought system.

To solve the problem of literary thought, fundamentally speaking, we must solve the problem of worldview. Literary thought is not an isolated thing; it is controlled by worldview and is subordinate to worldview. Chairman Mao teaches us in his "Talks": "Our literary and artistic workers must complete this task, must shift their standpoint, must, in the process of deeply approaching the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and deeply participating in practical struggles, in the process of learning Marxism and learning about society, gradually shift to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat." This is the path taught by Chairman Mao for us to reform our thoughts and solve the problem of worldview. Worldview ultimately has only two sides: one is the bourgeois worldview, and the other is the proletarian worldview. Summarized simply, it is two words: one is "self," and the other is "public." Literary thought controlled by worldview also has two sides: one is the exploiting class's, that is, feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist literary thought, and the other is the proletarian literary thought. Therefore, summarized simply, it is also two words: one is literature serving "self," and the other is literature serving "public," also "public" and "self" two words.

In the current period of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is a great opportunity for us to reform our worldview. In the great revolutionary period, we can learn much more than in ordinary times, even more in one day than in several years of ordinary times. As long as we seize the opportunity, dare to destroy and construct, we can quickly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art in our hearts.

III

In addition to Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," our ideological weapons for carrying out great criticism also include "On New Democracy," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On the Work of Propaganda," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and other works of Chairman Mao. As long as we grasp the weapons of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be invincible and unstoppable, and we will definitely be able to move from victory to greater victory.

"We should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage and should not seek fame like Xiang Yu." After the proletarian revolutionaries have seized the leadership, the task of struggle is not lighter but more arduous. Big and small ghosts and snakes will not willingly perish; they will struggle and counterattack. "Moreover, the big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes showing their poisonous fangs and snakes transforming into beautiful women, although they have felt the threat of winter, have not yet frozen to death!" We must be soberly aware: the hearts of each of us literary and artistic workers and various levels of literary and artistic departments and organizations have not yet completely and thoroughly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art. We must be soberly aware: the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan have been entrenched in the literary and artistic circles for so many years, and many places have been poisoned by them, and they have considerable power. Some of the poisonous roots we have uprooted, some are still buried there, and some have hidden away. We must be soberly aware: the literary and artistic ranks are still quite mixed, the left, middle, and right are not yet clearly divided, and the class ranks with the leftists as the core have just begun to form; the revisionist literary line has not been deeply and thoroughly criticized; the faces of some of the former leaders are not yet clear, and some units have not yet been able to carry out the "three-in-one" seizure of power, and so on, and so forth. All these await the revolutionary comrades in the literary and artistic circles to continue to carry out arduous struggles and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We firmly believe that great Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, and Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art is the most powerful weapon for us to defeat various forms of bourgeois and modern revisionist literary thoughts. As long as we study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we will definitely be able to transform the literary and artistic circles into a literary and artistic circle that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, and seize the literary and artistic positions from the revisionists, making them ours, the proletariat's.

Let us direct the cannons of great criticism at the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and the revisionist literary black line represented by Zhou Yang and Xia Yan! Let us direct the cannons of great criticism at the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party! The more we fire, the clearer the enemy's face; the more we fire, the clearer our minds. We will keep firing until the enemy falls, and keep firing until the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought is established in our hearts. In the smoke of the cannons, we welcome the dawn of the east and stride forward to the future of communism! (Accompanying picture: Quotations from Chairman Mao)

    大立毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威
    胡万春
    正当震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命在我国不断取得胜利的时候，我们纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，是有特别重要的深刻意义的。这部光辉的著作，集中地体现了毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，全面地、深刻地为无产阶级文艺的发展解决了一系列根本的问题。二十五年来，经过与形形色色资产阶级、修正主义文艺思想的交锋，毛泽东文艺思想更加放射出灿烂的光辉。它不仅是广大文艺工作者和知识分子改造思想、促进思想革命化的指路明灯，而且也是我国广大革命人民在意识形态领域灭资兴无、反修防修、防止资本主义复辟的极其强大的思想武器。这部伟大的著作，是发展无产阶级文艺事业的最高指示和最高纲领，是当代马克思列宁主义文艺理论的顶峰。在我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，更加显示了这部著作的伟大意义和战斗威力。
    这些年来，我们革命的文艺工作者，有一个深刻的体会：不论在任何情况下，只要我们按照这部著作的指示去做，我们就会无往而不胜；反之，我们就会犯错误，甚至成为资产阶级、修正主义文艺思想的俘虏。因此，拥护还是反对毛主席的《讲话》，是区别革命与反革命、真革命与假革命的标志之一。我们每个革命的文艺工作者，应该在实践中活学活用毛主席的《讲话》，在我们灵魂深处树立毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威，只有这样，才能使自己真正成为过硬的无产阶级文艺战士。
                           一
    新中国成立十七年来，文艺界是始终存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争的。一九六四年六月，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在对文艺部门所作的极为重要的批示中说：“这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。”为什么我们绝大多数的文艺部门和文艺团体不能很好地贯彻毛主席《讲话》的最高指示，按照毛泽东文艺思想办事呢？根本原因，就是从中央到地方，都有着一条和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线相对立的文艺黑线。这条黑线是为资本主义复辟服务的，它的代表人物就是陆定一、周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，他们的总后台就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。
    上海文艺界和全国文艺界一样，解放以来的十七年中，同样存在着尖锐、复杂的两条路线的斗争。一九六二年，我国连续遭受三年自然灾害，苏共修正主义领导集团对我国背信弃义施加经济压力。在当时国内外阶级斗争尖锐化的情况下，上海文艺界和全国文艺界一样，也刮起了一股黑风。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，趁坚决贯彻毛主席革命路线的柯庆施同志养病期间，加紧推行以周扬、夏衍为代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线，拒不贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线。他们从思想和组织两个方面向毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线进行了猖狂进攻：
    第一，他们在文艺思想上极力提倡封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺的反动货色。舞台上大演帝王将相、才子佳人，甚至连鬼戏、黄色戏也当作“传统节目”出笼，例如什么《李慧娘》、《半把剪刀》、《杀子报》、《少奶奶的扇子》。电影则提倡继承三十年代的“传统”，不惜工本地拍摄《舞台姐妹》等。文学方面同样地提倡“大”、“洋”、“古”和“封”、“资”、“修”。报纸刊物上大谈离开政治内容的所谓“风骨”、“文采”、“风格”等等，大量引用《文心雕龙》，只字不提毛主席的《讲话》。宣扬“有鬼无害论”，宣扬资产阶级低级趣味的作品，宣扬修正主义阶级调和超阶级人性论的作品，一时间，借古讽今、反党反社会主义的作品都纷纷出笼了。他们这样做，就是对抗毛主席《讲话》的最高指示，抵制毛泽东文艺思想在文艺界树立绝对权威，就是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备。
    第二，他们为了抵制无产阶级革命派贯彻毛主席《讲话》的最高指示，推行修正主义文艺路线，在组织上招降纳叛，向无产阶级革命派抢地盘，争领导权。上海文艺界党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，秉承着他们的“祖师爷”周扬的黑指示，在一九六二年大刮阴风，攻击党“忽略了对知识分子的培养”，叫嚷要组织“老的队伍”。在上海第二次文代会期间，竟然把那些反党反社会主义的资产阶级“权威”，修正主义分子，“三十年代”文艺的遗老遗少，封建余孽，反动文人，一个个地收容起来，发展为各种协会的会员，安插到文联当委员，并且给他们“发言权”。有了他们的“发言权”，就没有无产阶级革命派的发言权，就便于他们推行修正主义文艺路线。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”文艺战线两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，归根结底就是夺权斗争，就是资产阶级同无产阶级之间夺权和反夺权的斗争。在这一小撮修正主义分子篡夺了领导权的文艺部门和文艺团体里，水泼不进，针插不进，只准他们搞资产阶级、修正主义的一套，不准我们按毛主席《讲话》办事，搞无产阶级的一套；只准他们散布封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺思想，不准我们宣传毛泽东文艺思想。他们猖狂地进行反党反社会主义反毛泽东文艺思想的活动，把文艺界搞得乌烟瘴气。被称为“周扬黑店上海分店”的作家协会上海分会里，不仅有他们的“大掌柜”叶以群（叛党分子），还有“二掌柜”孔罗荪（国民党反动官僚），他们胆大包天，毛主席的话可以不听，周扬的话却唯命是从。他们根据周扬的黑指示搞了一整套修正主义的制度，让这批老爷们过着豪华的“高级生活”，长期不接触工农兵群众。一九六二年，上海市文联创办了一个文艺会堂。前文联秘书长孔罗荪为这个会堂制订了一个不要党的政治领导的“以文会友”的修正主义宗旨，为牛鬼蛇神大开方便之门，提供活动条件。西方电影、修正主义电影、黄色反动书刊泛滥成灾，流氓阿飞也肆意活动，这里变成了腐蚀青年文艺工作者的场所。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中还揭发出：过去被周扬、夏衍等人捧为“五四以来有国际影响的大作家”、“一贯靠近党的左派老知识分子”××，是最典型的资产阶级精神“贵族”。他光是钱就有将近三十万元之巨，大大小小各种各样的半导体收音机就有十多只，住的是三上三下的花园洋房，大草坪、大客厅、大书房，富丽堂皇。他过着寄生虫、吸血鬼的生活，写的却是反党反社会主义的大毒草，甚至不惜写毒草文章为美联社、台湾的《中央日报》提供炮弹，攻击无产阶级专政，反对毛泽东思想。
    毛主席早在二十五年前就在《讲话》中警告他们：“你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。”
    得到党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持，以周扬、夏衍为代表的修正主义文艺黑线，在上海受到坚决贯彻毛主席革命路线的、以柯庆施同志为代表的无产阶级革命派的抵制和斗争。柯庆施同志在毛主席亲自指示下，带病出来向文艺界这条反革命修正主义文艺黑线进行了坚决的斗争。一九六三年元旦，柯庆施同志按照毛主席《讲话》的最高指示，根据党中央八届十中全会的精神，针对周扬、夏衍对三十年代的鼓吹，向上海文艺工作者提出了反映社会主义革命和社会主义建设、反映工农兵斗争生活——“写十三年”的倡议。这个革命的倡议，体现了毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，是对文艺黑线针锋相对的迎头一击。它立刻遭到了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以周扬、夏衍为代表的文艺界一小撮修正主义分子的反对。在上海，周扬手下的干将叶以群也应声而出。他在《上海文学》一九六三年第二期上发表了《反映当代生活、宣传社会主义》的文章，打着“红旗”反红旗，公然号召继承三十年代“传统”，影射地污蔑柯庆施同志提倡写十三年的号召是“割断革命历史”，坚持要写过去、写旧社会，狂妄地继续为封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺鸣锣开道。
    柯庆施同志坚持贯彻毛主席《讲话》的最高指示，坚持“写十三年”的倡议，并且抱病亲自抓华东话剧会演，提出大演反映工农兵斗争生活的社会主义现代戏。当时，我也参加了两部反映社会主义时期工人阶级斗争生活的话剧创作。柯庆施同志一次又一次地抱病看我们的排演，提出修改剧本的意见，甚至一句一句地为我们修改台词。柯庆施同志在听取了江青同志的意见后，还组织文章批判了“有鬼无害论”。柯庆施同志不辞辛劳，坚持贯彻毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线的精神，是值得我们每个革命的文艺工作者学习的。
    这时，周扬一伙并不罢休，他们立刻开动宣传机器攻击柯庆施同志的倡议。上海文艺界党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，如叶以群之流又叫嚷要贯彻周扬的所谓“中央精神”。毛主席在《讲话》中教导我们：古代的和外国的文艺作品“不是源而是流”。而叶以群却公然与毛主席的《讲话》精神对抗，提出贯彻“一手伸向古代，一手伸向外国”的精神，提出贯彻现代戏、传统戏、历史戏“三条腿走路”的精神。周扬、夏衍一伙也在北京遥相呼应，在各种场合攻击柯庆施同志。当然，他们实际上是攻击毛主席的《讲话》，是攻击毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线。请看！这些反革命修正主义分子反毛泽东文艺思想的气焰是何等嚣张！
    “独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”坚持毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命派，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，向这条文艺黑线发起了总攻击，而且揪出了它的总后台——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。我们一定要把这条又粗又长的修正主义文艺黑线批深批透，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想占领一切文艺阵地！

    毛主席教导我们：“在我国，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想，反马克思主义的思想，还会长期存在。……无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。”我们应该清醒地看到，文艺界由于修正主义文艺黑线的长期控制，不少人在不同程度上受了封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺思想的毒。就拿我们左派队伍里的一些同志来说，这几年来也受过一些“封”、“资”、“修”东西的影响。特别是，有些同志受了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派《修养》的影响，奴隶主义比较严重，迷信那些披着共产党员外衣的“权威”，对周扬的修正主义文艺思想也没有能用毛泽东思想加以识别，往往盲目“听取”、“服从”，于是让敌人钻进自己脑子里来了。在纪念《讲话》二十五周年的时候，我们必须用毛泽东文艺思想检验自己，在各文艺部门和文艺团体中，在我们每个人的灵魂深处树立起毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威。
    “不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。我们要立毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威，就首先要破修正主义的文艺思想和文艺部门、文艺团体中存在的修正主义制度。我们面前破的任务是相当繁重的。文艺界的斗、批、改，就是破与立的问题。破，首先要从思想上来破；立，也首先要从思想上来立。破，就不是小破，中破，而是要大破。大破，也就是进行大批判，就是用毛泽东文艺思想全面地彻底地来批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和以周扬、夏衍为代表的反革命修正主义文艺路线，批判封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的文艺思想。大破才能大立。只有大破这些乌七八糟的东西，才能大立毛泽东文艺思想，贯彻毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线。毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威，就是在大破资产阶级、修正主义文艺思想体系的不断斗争中建立和发展起来的。
    要解决文艺思想问题，从根本上说来，就是要解决世界观的问题。文艺思想决不是什么孤立的东西，它是受世界观支配的，是从属于世界观的。毛主席在《讲话》中教导我们：“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”这就是毛主席教导我们的改造思想、解决世界观问题的途径。世界观说到底只有两家，一家是资产阶级世界观，一家是无产阶级世界观。归纳起来很简单，两个字，一个“私”字，一个“公”字。受世界观支配的文艺思想，也是两家，一家是剥削阶级的，即封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺思想，另一家是无产阶级的文艺思想。因此，归纳起来也是两个字：一种是为“私”服务的文艺，另一种是为“公”服务的文艺，也是“公”“私”两个字。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命时期，正是我们改造世界观的大好时机。在大革命时期能学到的东西要比平时学到的东西多得多，甚至一天学到的东西比平时几年中所学到的还多。只要我们抓紧时机，敢破敢立，我们就能够尽快地在自己灵魂深处树立起毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威。
                           三
    我们进行大批判的思想武器除了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以外，还有《新民主主义论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》以及毛主席的其他著作。只要我们掌握毛泽东思想的武器，我们就能无往不胜，无坚不摧，就一定能从胜利走向更大的胜利。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们无产阶级革命派在掌握了领导权以后，斗争任务不是轻松了，而是更加艰巨了。大大小小的牛鬼蛇神是不会心甘情愿灭亡的，他们必然要挣扎，要反扑。“况且盘踞在大部分中国土地上的大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！”我们应该清醒地看到：我们每个文艺工作者的灵魂深处和各级文艺部门、文艺团体中还没有完全、彻底地树立起毛泽东文艺思想的绝对权威。我们应该清醒地看到：以周扬、夏衍为代表的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在文艺界盘踞了那么多年，许多地方扎下了他们的毒根子，他们是有相当势力的。有的毒根子我们把它拔掉了，有的还埋在那儿，有的躲起来了。我们应该清醒地看到：文艺界的队伍还相当庞杂，左、中、右壁垒还不那么分明，以左派为核心的阶级队伍刚开始形成；修正主义文艺路线还未批深、批透；原来的有些当权派面目还不清楚，有些单位“三结合”夺权还搞不起来，等等，等等。这些都有待于文艺界的革命派同志，继续进行艰巨的斗争，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们深信：伟大的毛泽东思想是战无不胜的，毛泽东文艺思想是我们用以战胜形形色色资产阶级、现代修正主义文艺思想的最强大的武器。只要我们活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，为工农兵服务，和工农兵相结合，我们就一定能把文艺界改造成为一个高举毛泽东文艺思想伟大红旗的文艺界，把文艺阵地从修正主义分子手中夺回来，为我们无产阶级所有。
    让我们将大批判的炮口对准党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和以周扬、夏衍为代表的修正主义文艺黑线开炮吧！让我们将大批判的炮口对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开炮吧！越开炮，敌人的面目越清楚；越开炮，我们的头脑也越清醒。一直开炮到敌人倒下，一直开炮到我们灵魂深处树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们在炮火的硝烟中迎接着东方的曙光，昂首阔步地走向共产主义的未来！（附图片）
