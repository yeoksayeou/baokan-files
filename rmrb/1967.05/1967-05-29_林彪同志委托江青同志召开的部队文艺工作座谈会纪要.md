Edition: 1

From February 2 to February 20, 1966, Comrade Jiang Qing, at the request of Comrade Lin Biao, invited some comrades from the military to Shanghai to discuss several issues related to military artistic work. Before coming to Shanghai, Comrade Lin Biao gave the following instructions to the military comrades participating in the symposium: "Comrade Jiang Qing talked to me yesterday. She is very strong in political matters regarding artistic work and is also an expert in the arts. She has many valuable opinions. You must pay great attention to them and implement Comrade Jiang Qing's opinions in thought and organization. In the future, all military documents regarding artistic work should be sent to her for review. Any news can be shared with her at any time so that she can understand the situation of military artistic work, seek her opinions, and improve military artistic work. Military artistic work should not be satisfied with the current state in terms of both ideological and artistic aspects; it should be further improved." Comrades Xiao Hua and Yang Chengwu both expressed enthusiastic support and assistance for this symposium, instructing us to follow Comrade Jiang Qing's opinions and expressing gratitude for her concern for military artistic work.

At the beginning and during the discussions, Comrade Jiang Qing repeatedly stated: "I have not studied Chairman Mao's works enough, and I do not fully understand his thoughts. I only do what I understand. In the past four years, I have focused on reading some works and thinking about some opinions. These opinions may not all be correct. We are all Communist Party members, and for the sake of the Party's cause, we should have an equal discussion. This matter should have been done last year, but due to health issues, it was not done. Recently, my health has improved somewhat, and based on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, I have invited comrades to discuss together."

Comrade Jiang Qing suggested that we first watch some works, then read some related documents and materials, and then discuss. Comrade Jiang Qing provided us with Chairman Mao's related works and had individual discussions with military comrades eight times, collective discussions four times, and accompanied us to watch thirteen films and three performances. During the film and performance screenings, discussions were also conducted. Additionally, we were asked to watch twenty-one films. During this period, Comrade Jiang Qing also watched the sample film "South Sea Great Wall" and met with the director, cinematographer, and some actors, having three discussions with them, providing them with great education and encouragement. From our interactions, we felt that Comrade Jiang Qing has a deep understanding of Chairman Mao's thoughts and has conducted long-term, relatively thorough investigations and research on issues in the arts. She has personally experimented and has rich practical experience. This time, despite being ill, she worked diligently, humbly, enthusiastically, and sincerely with us, discussing and watching films and performances together, which gave us great inspiration and help.

In the nearly twenty days, we read two of Chairman Mao's works and related materials, listened to many very important opinions from Comrade Jiang Qing, and watched more than thirty films that were good, bad, and had varying degrees of flaws and errors. We also watched the relatively successful revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern" and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," which deepened our understanding of Chairman Mao's artistic thoughts and enhanced our understanding of the socialist cultural revolution. The following are the opinions agreed upon by everyone during this symposium:

1. For the past sixteen years, there has been a sharp class struggle on the cultural front. In fact, in the two stages of our revolution, namely the new democratic stage and the socialist stage, there has been a struggle between two classes and two lines on the cultural front, that is, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership on the cultural front. In the history of our Party, the struggle against "Left" and "Right" opportunism also included the struggle between two lines on the cultural front. The Wang Ming line was a bourgeois ideology that once prevailed in our Party. Starting in 1942, the rectification movement, Chairman Mao first thoroughly criticized Wang Ming's political line, military line, and organizational line in theory; then, he thoroughly criticized the cultural line represented by Wang Ming in theory. Chairman Mao's "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and "Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe After Watching 'Adventure to Liangshanpo'" are the most complete, comprehensive, and systematic historical summaries of the struggle between two lines on the cultural front, inheriting and developing Marxism-Leninism's worldview and artistic theory. After our revolution entered the socialist stage, Chairman Mao published "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China," which are the latest summaries of the historical experience of revolutionary thought and artistic movements in our country and other countries, and the new development of Marxism-Leninism's worldview and artistic theory. Chairman Mao's five works are enough for us proletarians to use for a long time.

Chairman Mao's first three works have been published for more than twenty years, and the latter two have been published for nearly ten years. However, since the founding of the country, the artistic circle has basically not implemented them and has been dominated by a black line opposed to Chairman Mao's thoughts, which is the bourgeois artistic thoughts, modern revisionist artistic thoughts, and the so-called "thirty-year artistic thoughts" combined. The "realism" theory, the "broad road of realism" theory, the "deepening of realism" theory, the anti-"theme determines" theory, the "intermediate character" theory, the anti-"gunpowder smell" theory, the "convergence of the spirit of the times" theory, and so on are their representative viewpoints, and these viewpoints are mostly those that Chairman Mao had already criticized in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The film circle also proposed the so-called "heretical" theory, which is to deviate from Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and betray the people's revolutionary war. Under the influence or control of this bourgeois, modern revisionist artistic thought countercurrent, in the past decade or so, there have been some good works that truly sing the praises of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, but not many; many are in an intermediate state; and there is a batch of anti-party, anti-socialist poisonous weeds. We must resolutely carry out a socialist cultural revolution on the cultural front according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and thoroughly eliminate this black line. After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to fight again. Therefore, this is a long-term, arduous, and complex struggle that will require decades or even hundreds of years of effort. This is a major issue related to the future of our country's revolution and the future of the world revolution.

The lesson of the past decade or so is that we have been slow to act. We have only addressed some individual issues and have not systematically addressed them as a whole. If we do not address them, many positions will be left to the black line to occupy, which is a serious lesson. After the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee decided in 1962 to carry out class struggle nationwide, the struggle to promote proletarian culture and eliminate bourgeois culture in the cultural field also gradually unfolded.

2. In the past three years, the socialist cultural revolution has shown a new situation, and the rise of revolutionary modern Beijing opera is the most prominent representative. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Mao Zedong as the head, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the artistic workers who engaged in the Beijing opera revolution have launched a fierce and tenacious attack on feudal, bourgeois, and modern revisionist art, with their sharp edge making the Beijing opera, the most stubborn fortress, undergo great revolutionary changes in both thought and form, and bringing about revolutionary changes in the artistic circle. The revolutionary modern Beijing operas "The Red Lantern," "The Detachment of the White-Tiger Regiment," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Red Guard," as well as the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," the symphony "The Detachment of the White-Tiger Regiment," and the clay sculpture "The Opium Den" have been approved by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and have been warmly welcomed by audiences at home and abroad. This is an innovation that will have a profound impact on the socialist cultural revolution. It powerfully proves that the Beijing opera, the most stubborn fortress, can be broken through and revolutionized; classical art forms such as ballet and symphony can also be transformed to serve us, and there should be even more confidence in the revolution of other arts. Some people say that revolutionary modern Beijing opera has abandoned the traditions of Beijing opera and the basic skills of Beijing opera. The fact is just the opposite. Revolutionary modern Beijing opera is a critical inheritance of the traditions of Beijing opera, a true innovation. The basic skills of Beijing opera are not abandoned but are not enough. Some skills that cannot express new life should and must be abandoned. To express new life, we urgently need to refine and create from life and gradually develop and enrich the basic skills of Beijing opera. At the same time, these facts also powerfully refute various conservatives and the so-called "box office value" theory, "foreign exchange value" theory, "revolutionary works cannot be exported" theory, and so on.

Another prominent manifestation of the socialist cultural revolution in the past three years is the widespread mass activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the ideological and artistic fronts. From among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, many excellent philosophical articles that skillfully express Mao Zedong Thought have emerged; at the same time, many excellent artistic works that sing the praises of the great victories of our country's socialist revolution, the great leaps forward on various fronts of socialist construction, our new heroes, our great Party, and the wise leadership of our great leader have also emerged, especially the large number of poems published by workers, peasants, and soldiers on wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers, which have marked a completely new era in both content and form.

Of course, these are only the initial achievements of the socialist cultural revolution, the first step of a long march. To defend and develop these achievements and carry the socialist cultural revolution to the end, we still need to make long-term, arduous efforts.

3. The struggle between two lines on the artistic front will inevitably be reflected within the military, and the military cannot be an exception, living in a vacuum. The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the main tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat in China and the reliance and hope of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. Without the people's army, there would be no victory in the revolution, no dictatorship of the proletariat, no socialism, and no people's everything. Therefore, the enemy will definitely try to sabotage it from all aspects and will definitely use the weapon of art to attempt to corrupt its ideology. However, some people, after Comrade Mao pointed out that the artistic circle has basically not implemented the Party's line in the past fifteen years, still say that the direction of military art has been solved and that the main issue is to improve the artistic level, which is a wrong view and lacks concrete analysis. In fact, the art of the military has some correct directions and relatively high artistic levels; some have correct directions but low artistic levels; some have serious flaws or errors in both political direction and artistic level; and some are anti-party, anti-socialist poisonous weeds. The August First Film Studio has even produced such a bad film as "Drafting Soldiers." This shows that the artistic work of the military has also been influenced by the black line to varying degrees. At the same time, we have cultivated very few truly capable creators; there are still many problems with creative thoughts; and there are still some impurities in the organization. We must make appropriate analyses and solutions to these problems.

4. In the socialist cultural revolution, the PLA must play an important role. Since Comrade Lin Biao has been in charge of the Military Commission, he has paid great attention to artistic work, giving many correct instructions; in the "Resolution on Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army" of the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, it is clearly stipulated that the task of military artistic work is: "It must closely combine with the tasks and ideological situation of the troops to serve the purpose of promoting proletarian culture and eliminating bourgeois culture, consolidating and improving combat effectiveness"; there is a group of artistic cadres in the army who have been cultivated by us and tempered through revolutionary wars; and some good works have also been created. Therefore, in the socialist cultural revolution, the PLA must play its due role, bravely and unwaveringly, and fight to implement the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialism in artistic work.

5. The cultural revolution must have both destruction and construction, and leaders must personally take charge and create good models. The bourgeoisie has a reactionary so-called "innovation monologue," and we must innovate and be different. Our innovation and difference are to innovate socialism and be different from the bourgeoisie. We must strive to create heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the fundamental task of socialist art. Only with such models and successful experiences in this aspect can we have persuasive power, firmly occupy the positions, and smash the reactionaries' sticks.

On this issue, we should not have an inferiority complex but should have a sense of pride.

We must break the superstition of the so-called "thirty-year art." At that time, the left-wing artistic movement was politically the "Left" opportunist line of Wang Ming, organizationally the sectarianism and cliquism, and the artistic thoughts were actually those of the Russian bourgeois art critics Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, and the theatrical aspects of Stanislavsky. They were bourgeois democrats of the Russian tsarist era, and their thoughts were not Marxism but bourgeois thoughts. The bourgeois democratic revolution is a revolution in which one exploiting class replaces another exploiting class, and only the socialist revolution of the proletariat is the revolution to finally eliminate all exploiting classes. Therefore, we must not regard the thoughts of any bourgeois revolutionary as the guiding principles of our proletarian thought and artistic movements. The thirties also had good things, which were the fighting left-wing artistic movements led by Lu Xun. By the mid-thirties, some left-wing leaders, under the influence of Wang Ming's right opportunist line, deviated from the class standpoint of Marxism-Leninism and proposed the slogan of "national defense literature." This slogan is a bourgeois slogan, while the proletarian slogan of "mass literature of national revolutionary war" was proposed by Lu Xun. Some left-wing artistic workers, especially Lu Xun, also proposed the slogans of serving workers and peasants and workers and peasants creating art, but they did not systematically solve the fundamental problem of combining art with workers, peasants, and soldiers. At that time, most left-wing artistic workers were still bourgeois national democrats, and some did not pass the test of people's democratic revolution, while some did not pass the test of socialism.

We must break the superstition of Chinese and foreign classical literature. Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist, and his criticism of bourgeois modernist art was very sharp, but he uncritically inherited the so-called classic works of Russia and Europe, with bad consequences. Chinese classical art, European (including Russian) classical art, and even American films have had a significant impact on our artistic circle, and some people regard them as classics and accept them wholesale. We should learn from Stalin's lesson. The works of ancient people and foreigners should also be studied, and it is wrong to reject studying them, but they must be studied with a critical eye to achieve the goal of using the past to serve the present and using foreign things to serve China.

We should also analyze the relatively excellent Soviet revolutionary artistic works that emerged after the October Revolution and should not worship or imitate them blindly. Blind imitation cannot become art. Literature and art can only come from the life of the people, and only the life of the people is the sole source of literature and art. The historical process of literature and art in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, has proven this.

The world has always been a new force overcoming the decaying force. Our People's Liberation Army was also small at the beginning but finally turned weakness into strength and defeated the reactionary forces of the United States and the Kuomintang. Facing the good revolutionary situation and glorious tasks at home and abroad, we should be proud to be thorough revolutionaries. We should have confidence and courage to do what previous generations have not done because our revolution is a revolution to finally eliminate the exploiting class, the exploiting system, and the ideological poison of all exploiting classes that harms the people from the root. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, we will create a socialist revolutionary new art that is unworthy of our great country, great Party, great people, and great army. This is the most brilliant and splendid new art that opens a new era in human history.

However, creating good models is not an easy task. Strategically, we must despise the difficulties in creation, but tactically, we must take them seriously. Creating a good work is a painful process, and comrades in charge of creation must not adopt a lordly attitude and must not be careless. They must share the hardships and joys with the creators and really work hard. They must try to master first-hand materials, and if not possible, they must master second-hand materials. They must not be afraid of failure or mistakes, must allow failure and mistakes, and must also allow the correction of mistakes. They must rely on the masses, come from the masses, and go to the masses, through long-term repeated practice, strive for perfection, and strive to achieve the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form. In practice, they must timely summarize experiences and gradually master the laws of various arts. Without doing this, it is impossible to create good models.

We must pay great attention to the themes of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it is completely wrong to neglect this point.

The artistic creation of the three major battles of Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin and other major battles should be carried out while the comrades who led and commanded these battles are still alive. Many important revolutionary historical themes and realistic themes urgently need us to organize creation in a planned and step-by-step manner. "South Sea Great Wall" must be filmed well. "Ten Thousand Miles and a Thousand Mountains" must be improved. Through these creations, a truly proletarian artistic cadre team should be trained and tempered.

6. In artistic work, whether it is leaders or creators, they must implement the Party's democratic centralism, advocate a "speakers' corner," oppose a "one-man show," and follow the mass line. In the past, some people created a work and forced the leaders to applaud and nod, which was a very bad style. As for the cadres in charge of creation, when dealing with artistic creation, they should always remember the following two points: first, they should be good at listening to the opinions of the broad masses; second, they should be good at analyzing these opinions, absorbing the good ones, and not absorbing the bad ones. There is no work without flaws, but as long as the basic tone is good, its flaws and errors should be pointed out and corrected. Bad works should not be hidden but should be taken out for the masses to comment on. We should not be afraid of the masses but should firmly believe in the masses, who will give us many valuable opinions. At the same time, we can also improve the masses' ability to discern. Making a film costs tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of yuan, but why not show the bad film and educate the creators and the people, and also make up for the economic loss of the country, achieving both ideological and economic gains? The film "The Enemy at the Gate" has been shown for a long time without anyone criticizing it. Can "Liberation Army Daily" write an article to criticize it?

7. We must advocate revolutionary, combative, and mass artistic criticism, break the monopoly of a few so-called "art critics" (those with wrong directions and weak and powerless critics) over artistic criticism, and hand the weapon of artistic criticism to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to wield, combining professional critics and mass critics. In artistic criticism, we must strengthen combativeness and oppose unprincipled flattery. We must reform the style of writing, advocate writing more popular short articles, turn artistic criticism into daggers and hand grenades, and train the hard skills within 200 meters; of course, we should also write some systematic, theoretically profound, and longer articles. We must oppose using terms and jargon to scare people. Only in this way can we disarm those so-called "art critics." "Liberation Army Daily" and "Liberation Army Literature" should open a regular or irregular column for artistic reviews, enthusiastically supporting good or basically good works, and also pointing out their flaws in a friendly manner; for bad works, we should conduct principled criticism. For some representative erroneous viewpoints in the field of artistic theory and some people's attempts to falsify history, elevate themselves, and spread many erroneous viewpoints in books such as "A History of the Development of Chinese Cinema," "A Collection of Historical Materials on the Fifty-Year Movement of Chinese Spoken Drama," and "An Initial Exploration of Beijing Opera Repertoires," we should carry out a planned and thorough criticism. We should not be afraid of being called sticks, and we should analyze when people say we are simple and rude. Our criticism is basically correct, but the analysis is not enough, the arguments are not sufficient, and the persuasiveness is weak, which should be improved. Some people have a problem of recognition; they first say we are simple and rude, but then they stop. When the enemy calls our correct criticism simple and rude, we must firmly resist. Artistic criticism should become a regular task and an important method to carry out artistic struggles, which is also an important method for the Party to lead artistic work. Without correct artistic criticism, it is impossible to flourish in creation.

8. In the struggle against foreign revisionism in the arts, we should not just catch small figures like Chukhrai. We should catch the big ones, catch Sholokhov. He is the ancestor of revisionist art. His "And Quiet Flows the Don," "Virgin Soil Upturned," and "One Man's Fate" have had a great influence on some Chinese authors and readers. Can the army organize some people to study and write analytical, well-reasoned, and persuasive critical articles? This will have a great impact on China and the world. The same should be done for domestic works.

9. In terms of creative methods, we should adopt the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, and not engage in bourgeois critical realism and bourgeois romanticism.

Under the correct guidance of the Party line, many heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers have emerged. Their excellent qualities are the concentrated expression of proletarian class nature. We should enthusiastically and in every possible way create the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers' heroes. We should create typical characters. Chairman Mao said: "The life reflected in literary and artistic works can and should be higher, stronger, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal than ordinary actual life." We should not be limited by real people and real events. We should not write about a hero only after a hero dies; in fact, there are many more living heroes than dead heroes. This requires our authors to concentrate and create various typical characters from long-term life accumulation.

When writing about revolutionary wars, we must first clarify the nature of the war. We are just, and the enemy is unjust. The works must show our arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, but they must also show revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. We should not exaggerate or praise the horror of war when describing the cruelty of war; we should not exaggerate or praise suffering when describing the hardships of revolutionary struggles. The cruelty of revolutionary war and revolutionary heroism, the hardships of revolutionary struggles and revolutionary optimism, are contradictory unities, but we must clarify what is the main aspect of the contradiction; otherwise, if the position is wrong, it will produce bourgeois pacifist tendencies. In addition, when describing people's revolutionary wars, whether in the stage of mainly guerrilla warfare and auxiliary mobile warfare or in the stage of mainly mobile warfare, we must correctly show the relationship between the regular army, guerrilla forces, and militias under the leadership of the Party, and the relationship between armed masses and non-armed masses.

The selection of themes requires in-depth investigation and research to choose correctly and accurately. Screenwriters must long-term and unconditionally immerse themselves in the fiery struggle of life, and directors, actors, cinematographers, art designers, composers, and other personnel must also immerse themselves in life and conduct good investigations and research. In the past, some works distorted historical facts, did not show the correct line, and only wrote about the wrong line; some works wrote about heroic figures, but they were all lawbreakers, or created a heroic image but let him die, artificially creating a tragic ending; some works did not write about heroic figures but only wrote about intermediate figures, which were actually backward figures, defaming the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers; and when describing the enemy, they did not expose the enemy's class nature of exploiting and oppressing the people but even beautified it; some works were about love affairs, low-level tastes, and talked about how "love" and "death" are eternal themes. These are all bourgeois and revisionist things and must be resolutely opposed.

10. Re-educate artistic cadres and reorganize the artistic team. Due to historical reasons, before the national liberation, it was more difficult for us proletarians to cultivate our own artistic workers under the enemy's rule. Our cultural level is relatively low, our experience is relatively little, and many of our artistic workers were educated and cultivated by the bourgeoisie. In the process of engaging in revolutionary artistic activities, some people could not withstand the enemy's persecution and betrayed, or could not withstand the corruption of bourgeois ideology and rotted away. In the base areas, we cultivated a considerable number of revolutionary artistic workers, especially after the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," they had the correct direction and walked the path of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers, playing an active role in the revolutionary process. The drawback is that after national liberation, many comrades could not resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology into our artistic team when they entered big cities, and thus some fell behind in the advance. Our art is proletarian art and the Party's art. The proletarian party principle is the most distinctive feature that distinguishes us from other classes. It is known that the representatives of other classes also have their party principles and are very tenacious. In terms of creative thoughts, organizational lines, and work styles, we must adhere to the proletarian party principle and oppose the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. We must draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology and cannot coexist peacefully. The various problems existing in the artistic circle are, for the majority of people, problems of ideological understanding and problems of education and improvement. We must seriously study Chairman Mao's works, learn and apply them actively, connect with thoughts, connect with reality, and study with problems. Only in this way can we truly understand, understand thoroughly, and master them. We must long-term immerse ourselves in life and combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, improve class consciousness, reform thoughts, not seek fame or wealth, and wholeheartedly serve the people. We must educate our comrades to read Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's books for life and rebel for life. We must especially pay attention to maintaining the late integrity of the proletariat, which is not easy for a person.

Through the symposium, we have a clearer understanding of the above issues, and the opinions on these issues also conform to the actual situation of military artistic work, which has improved our awareness and strengthened our determination and sense of responsibility for the socialist cultural revolution. We must continue to study Chairman Mao's works well, conduct thorough investigations and research, cultivate good experimental fields, create good models, and play a leading role in this cultural revolution to promote proletarian culture and eliminate bourgeois culture.

    林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要
    （一）
    一九六六年二月二日到二月二十日，江青同志根据林彪同志的委托，在上海邀请部队的一些同志，就部队文艺工作的若干问题进行了座谈。
    来上海之前，林彪同志对参加座谈会的部队同志曾作了如下的指示：“江青同志昨天和我谈了话。她对文艺工作方面在政治上很强，在艺术上也是内行，她有很多宝贵的意见，你们要很好重视，并且要把江青同志的意见在思想上、组织上认真落实。今后部队关于文艺方面的文件，要送给她看，有什么消息，随时可以同她联系，使她了解部队文艺工作情况，征求她的意见，使部队文艺工作能够有所改进。部队文艺工作无论是在思想性和艺术性方面都不要满足现状，都要更加提高。”萧华同志和杨成武同志，对这次座谈都表示热情赞助和支持，指示我们一定要按照江青同志的意见办，并对江青同志这样关心部队的文艺工作表示感谢。
    在座谈开始和交谈中，江青同志再三表示：对毛主席的著作学习不够，对毛主席的思想领会不深，只是学懂哪一点，就坚决去做。最近四年，比较集中地看了一些作品，想了一些意见，这些意见不一定全对。我们都是共产党员，为了党的事业，应当平等地进行交谈。这件事，去年就应该做，因为身体不行，没有做到。最近，身体好一些，根据林彪同志的指示，请同志们来共同商量。
    江青同志建议先看作品，再阅读一些有关的文件和材料，然后交谈。江青同志给我们阅读了毛主席的有关著作，并先后同部队的同志个别交谈八次，集体座谈四次，陪同我们看电影十三次，看戏三次。在看电影、看戏过程中，也随时进行了交谈。另外，还要我们看了二十一部影片。在此期间，江青同志又看了电影《南海长城》的样片，接见了《南海长城》的导演、摄影师和一部分演员，同他们谈话三次，给了他们很大的教育和鼓舞。我们在接触中感觉到：江青同志对毛主席思想领会较深，又对文艺方面存在的问题作了长时间的、相当充分的调查研究，亲自种试验田，有丰富的实践经验。这次带病工作，谦虚、热情、诚恳地同我们一起交谈，一起看影片、看戏，给了我们很大启发和帮助。
    （二）
    在近二十天中，我们阅读了毛主席的两篇著作和有关材料，听取了江青同志许多极为重要的意见，看了三十余部好的、坏的、和在不同程度上存在着缺点、错误的影片，又看了《奇袭白虎团》《智取威虎山》两出比较成功的革命现代京剧，从而加深了我们对毛主席文艺思想的理解，提高了对社会主义文化革命的认识。下面是在这次座谈会中大家商议和同意的几点意见：
    一、十六年来，文化战线上存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。
    事实上，在我国革命的两个阶段，即新民主主义阶段和社会主义阶段，文化战线上都存在两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，即无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的斗争。我们党的历史上，反对“左”右倾机会主义的斗争，也都包括文化战线上的两条路线斗争。王明路线是一种曾经在我们党内泛滥过的资产阶级思想。一九四二年开始的整风运动中，毛主席先在理论上彻底地批判了王明的政治路线、军事路线和组织路线；紧接着，又在理论上彻底地批判了以王明为代表的文化路线。毛主席的《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》，就是对文化战线上的两条路线斗争的最完整、最全面、最系统的历史总结，是马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的继承和发展。在我国革命进入社会主义阶段以后，毛主席又发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》两篇著作，这是我国和各国革命思想运动、文艺运动的历史经验的最新的总结，是马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的新发展。毛主席的这五篇著作，够我们无产阶级用上一个长时期了。
    毛主席的前三篇著作发表到现在已经二十几年了，后两篇也已经发表将近十年了。但是，文艺界在建国以来，却基本上没有执行，被一条与毛主席思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线专了我们的政，这条黑线就是资产阶级的文艺思想、现代修正主义的文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺的结合。“写真实”论、“现实主义广阔的道路”论、“现实主义的深化”论、反“题材决定”论、“中间人物”论、反“火药味”论、“时代精神汇合”论，等等，就是他们的代表性论点，而这些论点，大抵都是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中早已批判过的。电影界还有人提出所谓“离经叛道”论，就是离马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想之经，叛人民革命战争之道。在这股资产阶级、现代修正主义文艺思想逆流的影响或控制下，十几年来，真正歌颂工农兵的英雄人物，为工农兵服务的好的或者基本上好的作品也有，但是不多；不少是中间状态的作品；还有一批是反党反社会主义的毒草。我们一定要根据党中央的指示，坚决进行一场文化战线上的社会主义大革命，彻底搞掉这条黑线。搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。所以，这是一场艰巨、复杂、长期的斗争，要经过几十年甚至几百年的努力。这是关系到我国革命前途的大事，也是关系到世界革命前途的大事。
    过去十几年的教训是：我们抓迟了。只抓过一些个别问题，没有全盘的系统的抓起来，而只要我们不抓，很多阵地就只好听任黑线去占领，这是一条严重的教训。一九六二年十中全会作出要在全国进行阶级斗争这个决定之后，文化方面的兴无灭资的斗争也就一步一步地开展起来了。　
    二、近三年来，社会主义的文化大革命已经出现了新的形势，革命现代京剧的兴起就是最突出的代表。从事京剧革命的文艺工作者，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，以马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想为武器，向封建阶级、资产阶级和现代修正主义文艺展开了英勇顽强的进攻，锋芒所向，使京剧这个最顽固的堡垒，从思想到形式，都发生了极大的革命，并且带动文艺界发生着革命性的变化。革命现代京剧《红灯记》《沙家浜》《智取威虎山》《奇袭白虎团》等和芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、交响音乐《沙家浜》、泥塑《收租院》等，已经得到广大工农兵群众的批准，在国内外观众中，受到了极大的欢迎。这是一个创举，它将会对社会主义文化革命产生深远的影响。它有力地证明：京剧这个最顽固的堡垒也是可以攻破的，可以革命的；芭蕾舞、交响乐这种外来的古典艺术形式，也是可以加以改造，来为我们所用的，对其它艺术的革命就更应该有信心了。有人说革命现代京剧丢掉了京剧的传统，丢掉了京剧的基本功。事实恰恰相反，革命现代京剧正是对京剧传统的批判地继承，是真正的推陈出新。京剧的基本功不是丢掉了，而是不够用了，有些不能够表现新生活的，应该也必须丢掉。而为了表现新生活，正急需我们从生活中去提炼，去创造，去逐步发展和丰富京剧的基本功。同时，这些事实也有力地回击了形形色色的保守派，和所谓“票房价值”论、“外汇价值”论、“革命作品不能出口”论，等等。
    近三年来，社会主义文化革命的另一个突出表现，就是工农兵在思想、文艺战线上的广泛的群众活动。从工农兵群众中，不断地出现了许多优秀的、善于从实际出发表达毛泽东思想的哲学文章；同时，还不断地出现了许多优秀的、歌颂我国社会主义革命的伟大胜利，歌颂社会主义建设各个战线上的大跃进，歌颂我们的新英雄人物，歌颂我们伟大的党，伟大的领袖英明领导的文艺作品，特别是工农兵发表在墙报、黑板报上的大量诗歌，无论内容和形式都划出了一个完全崭新的时代。
    当然，这些都还只是社会主义文化革命的初步成果，是万里长征的第一步。为保卫和发展这一成果，把社会主义文化革命进行到底，还需要我们作长期的、艰苦的努力。
    三、文艺战线两条道路的斗争，必然要反映到军队内部来，军队不是生活在真空里，决不可能例外。中国人民解放军是中国无产阶级专政的主要工具，是中国人民和世界革命人民的依靠和希望。没有人民的军队，就没有革命的胜利，就没有无产阶级专政，就没有社会主义，也就没有人民的一切。因此，敌人一定会从各方面破坏它，也一定会利用文艺的武器，企图对它进行思想腐蚀。而有的人却在毛主席指出文艺界十五年来基本上没有执行党的方针以后，还说部队文艺方向已经解决了，主要是提高艺术水平的问题，这种观点是错误的，是缺乏具体分析的。事实上，军队的文艺有的方向对，艺术水平也比较高；有的方向对，艺术水平低；有的在政治方向和艺术水平方面都有严重的缺点或错误；也有的是反党反社会主义的毒草。八一电影制片厂就拍摄了《抓壮丁》这样的坏影片。这说明军队的文艺工作也在不同程度上受到了黑线的影响。同时，我们自己培养的真正过得硬的创作人材还比较少；创作思想问题还很多；组织上也还有些不纯。对这些问题，我们必须作出恰当的分析和解决。
    四、在社会主义文化革命中解放军要起重要作用。林彪同志主持军委工作以来，对文艺工作抓得很紧，作了很多很正确的指示；在中共中央军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》中，明确地规定部队文艺工作的任务是：“必须密切结合部队的任务和思想情况，为兴无灭资、巩固和提高战斗力服务”；军队中有一批我们自己培养的、经过革命战争锻炼的文艺骨干；也创作了一些好的作品。因此，在社会主义文化革命中，解放军一定要起应起的作用，勇敢地、坚定不移地，为贯彻执行文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方针而斗争。
    五、文化革命要有破有立，领导人要亲自抓，搞出好的样板。资产阶级有反动的所谓“创新独白”，我们要标新立异，我们的标新立异是标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。要努力塑造工农兵的英雄人物，这是社会主义文艺的根本任务。我们有了这样的样板，有了这方面成功的经验，才有说服力，才能巩固地占领阵地，才能打掉反动派的棍子。
    在这个问题上，不要有自卑感，而应当有自豪感。
    要破除对所谓三十年代文艺的迷信。那时，左翼文艺运动政治上是王明的“左倾”机会主义路线，组织上是关门主义和宗派主义，文艺思想实际上是俄国资产阶级文艺评论家别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫以及戏剧方面的斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的思想，他们是俄国沙皇时代资产阶级民主主义者，他们的思想不是马克思主义，而是资产阶级思想。资产阶级民主革命，是一个剥削阶级代替另一个剥削阶级的革命，只有无产阶级的社会主义革命，才是最后消灭一切剥削阶级的革命，因此，决不能把任何一个资产阶级革命家的思想，当成我们无产阶级思想运动、文艺运动的指导方针。三十年代也有好的，那就是以鲁迅为首的战斗的左翼文艺运动。到了三十年代的中期，那时左翼的某些领导人在王明的右倾投降主义路线的影响下，背离马克思列宁主义的阶级观点，提出了“国防文学”的口号。这个口号，就是资产阶级的口号，而“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个无产阶级的口号，却是鲁迅提出的。有些左翼文艺工作者，特别是鲁迅，也提出了文艺要为工农服务和工农自己创作文艺的口号，但是并没有系统地解决文艺同工农兵相结合这个根本问题。当时的左翼文艺工作者，绝大多数还是资产阶级民族民主主义者，有些人民主革命这一关就没过去，有些人没有过好社会主义这一关。
    要破除对中外古典文学的迷信。斯大林是个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他对资产阶级的现代派文艺的批评是很尖锐的，但是，他对俄国和欧洲的所谓经典著作却无批判地继承，后果不好。中国的古典文艺，欧洲（包括俄国）古典文艺，甚至美国电影，对我国文艺界的影响是不小的，有些人就当作经典，全盘接受。我们应当接受斯大林的教训。古人、外国人的东西也要研究，拒绝研究是错误的，但一定要用批判的眼光去研究，做到古为今用，外为中用。
    对十月革命后出现的一批比较优秀的苏联革命文艺作品，也要有分析，不能盲目崇拜，更不要盲目的模仿。盲目的模仿不能成为艺术。文学艺术只能来源于人民生活，只有人民生活才是文学艺术的唯一源泉，古今中外的文学艺术的历史过程，证明了这一点。
    世界上从来是新生力量战胜腐朽力量。我们人民解放军开头也是弱小的，终于转弱为强，战胜了美蒋反动派。面对着国内外大好的革命形势和光荣的任务，我们应该以做一个彻底的革命派而感到自豪。要有信心，有勇气，去做前人所没有做过的事，因为我们的革命，是一次最后消灭剥削阶级、剥削制度，和从根本上消除一切剥削阶级毒害人民群众的意识形态的革命。我们要在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的指导下，去创造无愧于我们伟大的国家，伟大的党，伟大的人民，伟大的军队的社会主义的革命新文艺。这是开创人类历史新纪元的、最光辉灿烂的新文艺。
    但是，要搞出好的样板决不是一件轻而易举的事。对创作中的困难，我们在战略上一定要蔑视它，而在战术上却一定要重视它。创作一部好的作品是一个艰苦的过程，抓创作的同志决不能采取老爷式的态度，决不可掉以轻心，要同创作者同甘共苦，真正下一番苦功夫。要尽可能地掌握第一手材料，不可能时也要掌握第二手材料。要不怕失败、不怕犯错误，要允许失败、允许犯错误，还要允许改正错误。要依靠群众，从群众中来，到群众中去，经过长时间的反复实践，精益求精，力求达到革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。在实践中及时总结经验，逐步掌握各种艺术的规律。不这样，就不可能搞出好的样板。
    我们应当十分重视社会主义革命和社会主义建设的题材，忽视这一点，是完全错误的。
    辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役及其他重大战役的文艺创作，也要趁着领导、指挥这些战役的同志健在，抓紧搞起来。许多重要的革命历史题材和现实题材，急需我们有计划、有步骤地组织创作。《南海长城》一定要拍好。《万水千山》一定要改好。并通过这些创作，培养锻炼出一支真正无产阶级的文艺骨干队伍。
    六、在文艺工作中，不论是领导人员，还是创作人员，都要实行党的民主集中制，提倡“群言堂”，反对“一言堂”，要走群众路线。过去有些人搞出一个作品，就逼着领导人鼓掌、点头，这是一种很坏的作风。至于抓创作的干部，对待文艺创作，应该经常记住这样两点：第一，要善于倾听广大群众的意见；第二，要善于分析这些意见，好的就吸收，不好的就不吸收。完全没有缺点的作品是没有的，只要基调还好，要指出其缺点错误，把它改好。坏作品不要藏起来，要拿出来交给群众去评论。我们不要怕群众，要坚决地相信群众，群众会给我们提出许多宝贵意见的。另外，也可以提高群众的鉴别能力。摄制一部电影要花费几十万元或者上百万元，把坏片子藏起来，白白地浪费掉了，为什么不拿出来放映，从而教育创作人员和人民群众，又可以弥补国家经济上的损失，做到思想、经济双丰收呢？影片《兵临城下》演了好久，也没有人批评，《解放军报》是否可以写篇文章批评一下。
    七、要提倡革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评，打破少数所谓“文艺批评家”（即方向错误的和软弱无力的那些批评家）对文艺批评的垄断，把文艺批评的武器交给广大工农兵群众去掌握，使专门批评家和群众批评家结合起来。在文艺批评中，要加强战斗性，反对无原则的庸俗捧场。要改造文风，提倡多写通俗的短文，把文艺批评变成匕首和手榴弹，练出二百米内的硬功夫；当然也要写一些系统的，有理论深度的较长的文章。反对用名词术语吓人。只有这样，才能缴掉那些所谓“文艺批评家”的械。《解放军报》《解放军文艺》要开辟定期的或不定期的文艺评论专栏，对好的或者基本上好的作品要热情支持，也可以善意地指出它的缺点；对坏作品，要进行原则性的批评。对于文艺理论方面一些有代表性的错误论点，和某些人在一些什么《中国电影发展史》《中国话剧运动五十年史料集》《京剧剧目初探》之类的书中企图伪造历史、抬高自己，以及所散布的许多错误论点，都要有计划地进行彻底的批判。不要怕有人骂我们是棍子，对人家说我们简单粗暴要有分析。我们有的批评基本正确，但是分析不够，论据不充分，说服力差，应该改进。有的人是认识问题，他们先说我们简单粗暴，后来就不说了。对敌人把我们正确的批评骂做是简单粗暴，就一定要坚决顶住。文艺评论要成为经常的工作，成为开展文艺斗争的重要方法，也是党领导文艺工作的重要方法。没有正确的文艺评论，就不可能繁荣创作。
    八、文艺上反对外国修正主义的斗争，不能只捉丘赫拉依之类小人物。要捉大的，捉肖洛霍夫，要敢于碰他。他是修正主义文艺的鼻祖。他的《静静的顿河》《被开垦的处女地》《一个人的遭遇》对中国的部分作者和读者影响很大。军队是否可以组织一些人加以研究，写出有分析的、论据充分的、有说服力的批判文章。这对中国，对世界都有很大影响。对国内的作品，也应当这样做。
    九、在创作方法上，要采取革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的方法，不要搞资产阶级的批判现实主义和资产阶级的浪漫主义。
    在党的正确路线指引下涌现的工农兵英雄人物，他们的优秀品质是无产阶级阶级性的集中表现。我们要满腔热情地、千方百计地去塑造工农兵的英雄形象。要塑造典型，毛主席说：“文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。”不要受真人真事的局限。不要死一个英雄才写一个英雄，其实，活着的英雄要比死去的英雄多得多。这就需要我们的作者从长期的生活积累中，去集中概括，创造出各种各样的典型人物来。
    写革命战争，要首先明确战争的性质，我们是正义的，敌人是非正义的。作品中一定要表现我们的艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲，但是，也一定要表现革命的英雄主义和革命的乐观主义。不要在描写战争的残酷性时，去渲染或颂扬战争的恐怖；不要在描写革命斗争的艰苦性时，去渲染或颂扬苦难。革命战争的残酷性和革命的英雄主义，革命斗争的艰苦性和革命的乐观主义，都是对立的统一，但一定要弄清楚什么是矛盾的主要方面，否则，位置摆错了，就会产生资产阶级和平主义倾向。此外，在描写人民革命战争的时候，不论是在以游击战为主，运动战为辅的阶段，还是以运动战为主的阶段，都要正确地表现党领导下的正规军、游击队和民兵的关系，武装群众和非武装群众的关系。
    选择题材要深入生活，很好地调查研究，才能选对、选准。编剧要长期地、无条件地深入到火热的斗争生活中去，导演、演员、摄影、美术、作曲等人员也要深入生活，很好地进行调查研究。过去，有些作品，歪曲历史事实，不表现正确路线，专写错误路线；有些作品，写了英雄人物，但都是犯纪律的，或者塑造起一个英雄形象却让他死掉，人为地制造一个悲剧的结局；有些作品，不写英雄人物，专写中间人物，实际上是落后人物，丑化工农兵形象；而对敌人的描写，却不是暴露敌人剥削、压迫人民的阶级本质，甚至加以美化；还有些作品，则专搞谈情说爱，低级趣味，说什么“爱”和“死”是永恒主题。这些都是资产阶级的、修正主义的东西，必须坚决反对。
    十、重新教育文艺干部，重新组织文艺队伍。由于历史的原因，在全国解放前，我们无产阶级在敌人的统治下培养自己的文艺工作者要困难一些。我们的文化水平比较低，我们的经验比较少，我们的许多文艺工作者，是受资产阶级的教育培养起来的，在从事革命文艺活动的过程中，有些人又经不起敌人的迫害叛变了，或者经不起资产阶级思想的腐蚀烂掉了。在根据地，我们培养过相当数量的革命文艺工作者，特别是《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表以后，他们有了正确的方向，走上同工农兵相结合的道路，在革命过程中起过积极的作用。缺点是，在全国解放后，进了大城市，许多同志没有抵抗住资产阶级思想对我们文艺队伍的侵蚀，因而有的在前进中掉队了。我们的文艺是无产阶级的文艺，是党的文艺。无产阶级的党性原则是我们区别于其他阶级的最显著标志。须知其他阶级的代表人物也是有他们的党性原则的，并且很顽强。不论是创作思想方面，组织路线方面，工作作风方面，都要坚持无产阶级的党性原则，反对资产阶级思想的侵蚀。同资产阶级思想必须划清界线，决不能和平共处。现在文艺界存在的各种问题，对大多数人来讲，是思想认识问题，是教育提高的问题。要认真学习毛主席著作，活学活用，联系思想，联系实际，带着问题学，才能真正学得懂、学得通、学到手。要长期深入生活，和工农兵相结合，提高阶级觉悟，改造思想，不为名，不为利，全心全意地为人民服务。要教育我们的同志，读一辈子马克思列宁主义和毛主席的书，革一辈子命。特别要注意保持无产阶级的晚节，一个人能保持晚节是很不容易的。
    （三）
    通过座谈，我们对上述问题都有了较明确的认识，对这些问题的意见，也都符合军队文艺工作的实际情况，从而提高了我们的觉悟，加强了社会主义文化革命的决心和责任感。我们一定要继续学好毛主席的著作，认真进行调查研究，种好试验田，搞好样板，在这一场兴无灭资的文化革命斗争中起好带头作用。
