The Struggle Committee of Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots Against British Oppression calls for Hong Kong compatriots to organize quickly, raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and, at any cost, carry the struggle through to the end.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, HONG KONG, May 24 - The Struggle Committee of Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots Against British Oppression held an expanded meeting on the morning of May 23. The representatives present angrily denounced the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong for their heinous crimes of bloody suppression against the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon. The representatives resolutely declared: With the revolutionary heroism of "For the sake of sacrifice, we have great aspirations, daring to let the sun and moon shine a new day," we will not hesitate to make any sacrifice, no matter what the cost, and we will definitely carry the struggle against oppression through to the end.

	Chairman Yang Guang of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions pointed out at the meeting that the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly expanded their oppression against the Chinese people of Hong Kong and Kowloon. They think that they can suppress us with fascist bloody methods, but this is absolutely impossible. Let the British authorities bring out all their tricks; the higher their level of bloody suppression, the higher our level of struggle against oppression will be. The people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have already made up their minds: we are not afraid of sacrifice and will strive for the final victory. Yang Guang called on the people of Hong Kong to mobilize quickly, organize, raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight to the end without achieving complete victory.

	Representatives from various sectors reported many heroic deeds of the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon in this anti-imperialist, patriotic struggle, and they all expressed their determination to fight. A representative from the publishing industry said in great indignation that on May 22, more than twenty employees from the publishing industry were brutally beaten by hundreds of fascist thugs like wolves and tigers, but they remained steadfast and resisted firmly. Although many employees were beaten to the point of unconsciousness, they still shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The representatives of Hong Kong public bus workers, tram workers, and Kowloon public bus workers reported on their brave struggles of stopping work to protest and counterattacking the British "riot control" forces. The entire venue erupted in warm applause to pay tribute to them. The student representative said in his speech that he would definitely learn from the workers and the Red Guards of the motherland to strive to be at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle.

	The representatives said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." The British authorities in Hong Kong attempt to suppress the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon from learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought with high-pressure methods. We must defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine in every corner of Hong Kong and Kowloon, radiating even more brilliant light. They pointed out that the blood of the people of Hong Kong will not be shed in vain, and blood debts must be repaid with blood. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, not be intimidated by the reactionaries' ferocious appearance, and resolutely carry the struggle against oppression through to the end.

	At the meeting, a representative reported that the Chinese government has decided to cancel the arrangement for the British Consulate-General in Shanghai to send personnel to handle overseas affairs and ordered them to leave Shanghai within 48 hours. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in thunderous cheers.

	This meeting was a meeting of accusation, unity, and struggle. More than 300 committee members attended. The meeting unanimously decided to establish a standing committee of the Struggle Committee of Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots Against British Oppression consisting of 17 people and elected Yang Guang as the chairman.

    港九同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会号召香港同胞迅速组织起来
    高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗  不惜任何牺牲将斗争进行到底
    新华社香港二十四日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会二十三日上午举行扩大会议，愤怒声讨英国政府和香港英国当局对港九同胞进行血腥镇压的滔天罪行。代表们坚决表示：要以“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”的革命英雄气概，不惜任何牺牲，不管付出多大代价，誓把反迫害斗争进行到底。
    港九工会联合会理事长杨光在会上指出，香港英国当局一再扩大迫害港九中国同胞，他们以为用法西斯血腥手段可以压倒我们，这是万万做不到的。港英当局有什么看家本领都使出来吧，你们的血腥镇压升级，我们的反迫害斗争也要升级。用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九同胞早已下定决心，不怕牺牲，去争取最后胜利。杨光号召香港同胞迅速动员起来，组织起来，高高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不获全胜，决不罢休。
    各界代表在发言中报告了港九同胞在这场反帝爱国斗争中的许多可歌可泣的英雄事迹，并纷纷表示斗争的决心。出版界代表万分激愤地说，五月二十二日，出版界的二十多名职工代表在遭到几百名如狼似虎的法西斯暴徒毒打时，坚贞不屈，顽强抵抗，虽然很多职工被打得处于昏迷状态，但仍高呼“毛主席万岁！”香港公共汽车工人、电车工人和九龙公共汽车工人在会上报告了他们停工抗议和回击港英“防暴队”镇压的英勇斗争经过，全场热烈鼓掌向他们致敬。学生代表在讲话中表示一定要向工人学习，向祖国红卫兵小将学习，争取站在反帝斗争的第一线。
    代表们说，毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。港英当局妄图以高压手段来遏制港九同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想，我们就要誓死捍卫毛泽东思想，就要让光焰无际的毛泽东思想照到港九每一个角落，放射出更加灿烂的光辉。他们指出，香港同胞的血是不会白流的，血债一定要血偿。我们一定牢记毛主席的教导，绝不被反动派的其势汹汹所吓倒，坚决把反迫害斗争进行到底。
    会上，一位代表报告了中国政府决定取消英国驻华代办处向上海派驻办理侨务人员的安排，并限令其人员于四十八小时内离开上海的消息，这时，全场响起了雷鸣般的欢呼声。
    这次大会是一个控诉的大会，团结的大会，战斗的大会，出席的委员共三百多人。会议一致通过成立由十七人组成的港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会常务委员会，并选出杨光为主任委员。
