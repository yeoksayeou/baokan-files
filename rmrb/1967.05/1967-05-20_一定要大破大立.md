	We must thoroughly criticize and establish. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without cessation, there can be no progress." Criticism is revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly criticize and destroy bourgeois and revisionist thought on the political and ideological fronts, and to establish Mao Zedong Thought.

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen's "Report Outline" absurdly claims that "without establishment, it is impossible to achieve true and thorough criticism." This is to prevent us from criticizing and destroying the stinking things of the bourgeoisie, allowing the capitalist roaders in power to lead China back to the dark path!

	We revolutionary soldiers must firmly hold high the banner of criticism, thoroughly criticize the black "Report Outline" and "Cultivation," and establish Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that our country remains red for generations to come, and guiding all of humanity towards the bright and radiant path of communism!

	Soldier of the People's Liberation Army, Five Good Soldier Wang Jun

    一定要大破大立
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。”破就是批判，就是革命。无产阶级文化大革命，就是要在政治战线和思想战线上大破资产阶级和修正主义思想，大立毛泽东思想。反革命修正主义分子彭真的《汇报提纲》，胡说什么“没有立，就不可能达到真正、彻底的破。”就是要我们永远不去破资产阶级的臭东西，让走资本主义道路的当权派，把中国重新引向黑暗的道路！
    我们革命战士一定要高举批判的战斗大旗，大破黑《提纲》和《修养》，大立毛泽东思想，让祖国千秋万代不变色，把全人类引向光明灿烂的共产主义！
