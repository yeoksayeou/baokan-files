New York, May 13, Xinhua News Agency: According to a report by the Associated Press, "Three American communication satellites will be connected with the Soviet Union's 'Molnija' communication satellite on June 25 to broadcast television programs to audiences in thirty countries," strengthening reactionary propaganda. This is another new step taken by the Brezhnev-Kosygin revisionist clique in acting as a henchman for U.S. imperialism.

U.S. imperialism, in order to realize its dream of ruling the world, in addition to using armed invasion and suppression, also uses news, radio, television, publishing, and other "cultural" means to maliciously slander the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and to use decadent and corrupt "Western culture" to numb the people's fighting spirit. In this regard, the Soviet revisionist clique's collaboration with U.S. imperialism is unremitting. Not long after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet revisionist authorities began to intermittently stop jamming the U.S. imperialist propaganda tool "Voice of America" broadcasts into the Soviet Union. In 1963, the Soviet revisionist clique formally stopped jamming "Voice of America." After 1960, Soviet radio stations began directly broadcasting programs prepared by the U.S. Information Agency and "Voice of America," making itself a branch of "Voice of America."

Now, the Soviet revisionist authorities have further connected their own satellites with those of U.S. imperialism, collaborating with U.S. imperialism to further expand the scope of reactionary television poisoning.

To help U.S. imperialist reactionary propaganda attract viewers, the Soviet revisionist clique is not reluctant to offer its own military secrets as cheap bait. According to reports, the Soviet revisionist clique "has agreed" to shoot and screen for U.S. imperialism's television system "films about the hitherto unpublicized 'cosmic port' near Baikonur."

    两国通讯卫星联播电视节目
    宣扬西方文化麻痹人民斗志
    新华社十三日讯　纽约消息：据美联社报道，“美国的三个通讯卫星将于六月二十五日同苏联的‘闪电’通讯卫星连接，给三十个国家的观众放送电视节目”，加强反动宣传。这是勃列日涅夫—柯西金修正主义集团充当美帝帮凶的又一新步骤。
    美帝国主义为了实现其统治全世界的迷梦，除了采用武装侵略和镇压以外，还通过新闻、广播、电视、出版等等“文”的手段，对世界人民的革命斗争进行恶毒污蔑，用腐朽颓废的“西方文化”来麻痹人民的斗争意志。在这方面，苏修集团对美帝的配合是不遗余力的。早在苏共二十大以后不久，苏修当局就开始断断续续停止干扰美帝宣传工具“美国之音”的对苏广播。一九六三年，苏修集团正式停止对“美国之音”的干扰。一九六○年以后，苏联电台开始直接播送美国新闻署和“美国之音”准备的节目，使自己成为“美国之音”的分号。
    现在，苏修当局竟进一步把自己的卫星同美帝的卫星“连接”起来，伙同美帝进一步扩大反动电视的毒害范围。
    为了帮助美帝反动宣传招徕观众，苏修集团还不惜献出自己的国防机密，做为廉价诱饵。据报道，苏修集团“已经答应”为美帝这套电视系统“拍摄放映关于迄今为止不公开的拜科努尔附近的‘宇宙航行港’”。
