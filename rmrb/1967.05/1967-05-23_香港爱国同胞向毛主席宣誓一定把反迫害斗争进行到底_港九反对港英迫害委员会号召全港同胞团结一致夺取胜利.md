Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots' anti-British persecution struggle committee held an emergency meeting this morning. The meeting strongly condemned the British authorities in Hong Kong for deliberately escalating the situation and further carrying out bloody suppression and cruel persecution against Hong Kong Chinese compatriots. The meeting warned the British authorities that they must immediately and unconditionally accept the five stern demands of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the four demands of the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots' anti-British persecution struggle committee. The emergency meeting called on all Hong Kong compatriots to mobilize, unite as one, and continue the anti-persecution struggle to the end, seizing final victory.

The meeting was chaired by Yang Guang, chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions. All committee members attending the meeting unanimously passed the following decisions: to expand the number of committee members from various sectors opposing British persecution; to issue a "Letter to All Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots"; to issue an "Emergency Announcement," stating that all those who have been persecuted, arrested, beaten, illegally interrogated, gone missing, or suffered losses or hardships due to British persecution can register with the anti-persecution struggle committee of various sectors and make their demands; to launch fundraising and comfort the victims.

The "Letter to All Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots" revealed: In recent days, Dai Linzhi has publicly rejected the protests of representatives from various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon, while also operating its propaganda machine to confuse right and wrong and deceive people, in order to achieve its unspoken conspiracies.

The "Letter to All Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots" sternly pointed out: "The British authorities in Hong Kong have planned and organized a bloody suppression against our compatriots. They want to collude with the American imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits to oppose the Chinese people; they want to obstruct the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought and counteract the great influence of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; they want to extinguish the just-ignited flames of the Hong Kong working class struggle; they want to strike at our thriving patriotic forces; they want to infringe upon the legitimate rights of our Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. They foolishly believe that China is busy with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and cannot attend to the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, but they have miscalculated the time and chosen the wrong opponent, and they will surely suffer a crushing defeat."

The "Letter to All Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots" pointed out: In the past ten days, tens of thousands of compatriots have been forced to rise up in resistance. We have only just shown our strength, but we have already greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and greatly dampened the arrogance of imperialism. The true colors of British imperialism's "paper tiger" have been exposed to the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots.

The "Letter to All Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots" said: Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the most urgent and strongest protest statement to the British government on May 15, and thousands upon thousands of revolutionary masses and Red Guards in Beijing and major cities across the country held grand demonstrations to denounce British imperialism. "This is the strong support of our motherland, it is the boundless concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for the Hong Kong compatriots, and we feel greatly inspired! We feel that Chairman Mao is by our side, which further boosts our fighting spirit. We firmly support the statement of our government! We are extremely grateful for the strong support of the government and people of our motherland! We solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: We must continue this anti-persecution struggle to the end!"

"We only need to unite thousands upon thousands of compatriots, organize the surging anti-persecution struggle army, and the British authorities will be submerged in the vast sea of anti-violence struggles of Hong Kong Chinese residents. The British will surely be defeated, and we will surely be victorious!"

    香港爱国同胞向毛主席宣誓一定把反迫害斗争进行到底
    港九反对港英迫害委员会号召全港同胞团结一致夺取胜利
    据新华社香港二十一日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会今天上午举行全体紧急会议，最最强烈抗议香港英国当局蓄意扩大事态，进一步对香港中国同胞进行血腥镇压和残酷迫害的暴行；警告港英当局必须立即无条件地接受我外交部的五项严正要求和港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会的四项要求。紧急会议号召全香港同胞动员起来，团结一致，把反迫害斗争进行到底，夺取最后胜利。
    会议由港九工会联合会理事长杨光主持。全体参加会议的委员一致通过下列决定：扩大各界反对港英迫害斗争委员会委员名额；发表《告全港九同胞书》；发表《紧急通告》，凡受港英迫害、逮捕、殴打、非法审讯、失踪及因而遭受损失，或生活困难者，一律可向各界反迫害斗争委员会登记，并提出要求；发动捐款和慰问受害者。
    会议通过的《告全港九同胞书》揭露说：近日来，戴麟趾一面公然拒绝港九各界代表的抗议，一面又开动它的宣传机器力图混淆是非，蛊惑人心，以遂其不可告人的阴谋。
    《告全港九同胞书》严正指出：“港英当局这次对我同胞进行有计划、有组织的血腥镇压，这是蓄谋已久的。它要勾结美帝、蒋匪反对中国人民；它要阻遏伟大的毛泽东思想的传播和抵消我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响；它要扑灭刚刚点燃的香港工人阶级斗争的烈火；它要打击我们蓬勃发展的爱国力量；它要侵犯我港九同胞的正当权益。他们异想天开地认为中国正忙于无产阶级文化大革命，顾不了香港的中国同胞，但是他们算错时间，找错对手，他们必将碰得头破血流”。
    《告全港九同胞书》指出：十多天来，成千上万的同胞被迫起来反抗，我们仅仅是初试锋芒，已经大长中国人民的志气，大灭帝国主义的威风，港英帝国主义的“纸老虎”原形已经暴露在港九同胞的面前。
    《告全港九同胞书》说：我国外交部在五月十五日向英国政府提出了最紧急、最强烈的抗议声明，北京和全国各大城市的千千万万革命群众和红卫兵举行声势浩大的声讨英帝国主义的大示威，“这是祖国对我们的强大支持，是我们伟大的领袖毛主席对香港同胞的无限关怀，我们的心里感到无限振奋！我们感到毛主席就在我们身边，更加鼓舞我们的斗志。我们坚决拥护我国政府的声明！万分感谢祖国政府和全国人民的强大支持！我们谨向毛主席宣誓：一定要把这场反迫害斗争进行到底！”
    “我们只要把千千万万的同胞团结起来，把浩浩荡荡的反迫害斗争大军组织起来，港英当局就会陷在香港中国居民抗暴斗争的汪洋大海之中。港英必败，我们必胜！”
