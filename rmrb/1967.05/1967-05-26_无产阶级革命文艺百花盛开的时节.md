I watched the revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" with a heart full of excitement. A scene in the play reminded me of a photograph I had seen in the newspaper not long ago: American invaders beating a young woman from South Vietnam. This young woman with her long, black hair was struggling with all her might. I thought, by now, her hair must have turned white from suffering, just like Xi'er. But perhaps she is now in the jungle, fighting side by side with the guerrilla forces, struggling for the liberation of her country. Xi'er's story is being replayed in reality.

In the past, Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang, and landlords oppressed the Chinese people. Now, American imperialism and its puppets are carrying out evil invasions against the Vietnamese people. But where there is oppression, there is rebellion. In Vietnam, tens of thousands of "Xi'ers" have stood up, dealing fatal blows to the invaders. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and throughout the world, facing the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and reactionaries, millions of "Xi'ers" have risen up in rebellion. Therefore, the stage performance is Xi'er's story, but what I see in Xi'er is the female guerrilla fighters in the rice fields of Vietnam, the African girls who have seized the whip from the neo-colonialists, and the young women in South America who denounce American imperialism in the face of the invaders' bayonets. In Xi'er, I see all the oppressed and poor people who are fighting for their own liberation and for the establishment of a new world without exploitation and oppression. All of this, I saw in "The White-Haired Girl."

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" states: "The life reflected in works of art can and should be on a higher plane, more intense, more concentrated, more typical, more ideal, and therefore more universal than actual everyday life. Revolutionary art and literature should create a great variety of characters and depict them in the struggle to transform the world, thus helping the people to push history forward." "The White-Haired Girl" not only inspires the Chinese audience but also inspires people from all continents to unite and fight together. This shows that "The White-Haired Girl" embodies Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thought, which is true revolutionary art. This also shows that Chairman Mao's views on literature and art are universal truths.

When I came to China from a capitalist country thousands of miles away, I did not have a clear understanding of literature and art, although I had tried to rid myself of the wrong views instilled in me by bourgeois schools. It can be said that it was through the modern plays that were first performed at that time that I first had a deep contact with China. Not long after I arrived in China, one evening I was invited to watch the modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." At first, I intended to go to the theater to pass the time, "to entertain myself." But I was wrong. From the first scene, I found that what was presented to me was something completely new: the characters on the stage spoke the language of class struggle, the language of revolution, the language of life. I saw that on this very stage, my revolutionary thoughts and feelings were concretized. It was from then on that I began to understand what art should be.

Soon after, another incident left a deep impression on me, but this time it was a bad one. After watching several revolutionary dramas and the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," I had the opportunity to watch a traditional play. What impressed me was not just the stories of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on the stage, but also the people in the theater. The audience was not at all "active," unlike when watching revolutionary performances, where they would be moved by the experiences of the characters on stage. The colorful costumes did not dispel the cold atmosphere between the performers and the audience.

The above contrast taught me a lot. For the first time, I truly understood Chairman Mao's words: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art are class culture or literature and art, and they definitely have a definite class character and a definite political line. Art for art's sake, classless art, and art that is parallel to or independent of politics do not exist in reality." "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and for them to use." I had read these two passages before, but I had not understood their profound meaning. Were the stories of scholars and beauties created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers? Of course not. For many years, although the people were advancing in socialist construction, the stage was still dominated by scholars, beauties, and ghosts and monsters. At that time, it seemed as if there were two worlds: one was the real world, full of vitality and revolutionary enthusiasm; the other was the world of drama, filled with ghosts and monsters. Why couldn't the world of drama reflect the real world? Because at that time, the world of drama belonged to the old exploiting classes and reflected the thoughts of these classes.

In 1944, after Chairman Mao watched the performance of "Adventure to Liangshan Mountain" by the Yan'an Drama Troupe, he pointed out: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (and in all literature and art that are separated from the people) the people are turned into dregs, ruled by gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring the true face of history. From now on, the old drama has a new life, so it is worth celebrating." But for many years, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roaders in the Chinese Communist Party, a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by Zhou Yang stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's directive and vigorously opposed the revolutionary literary and artistic line proposed by Chairman Mao in his "Talks."

Comrade Jiang Qing has always insisted on and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. Over the years, she has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, through arduous struggles, has created a series of revolutionary models in the creation of revolutionary modern Peking opera, revolutionary modern ballet, and revolutionary modern symphonic music, making the heroic images of the working-class, peasant, and soldier masses, the true creators of history, shine brightly on the stage for the first time, and truly making proletarian revolutionary drama a powerful weapon to "unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy."

The propaganda machines of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism slander that the purpose of China's proletarian cultural revolution is to destroy traditional arts and exclude foreign cultures. This is a crazy slander. The reforms of Peking opera, ballet, symphony, etc., have implemented Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy of "critically inheriting the useful elements of national heritage and foreign cultures" and "using the past to serve the present and using foreign things to serve China." The lies of the imperialists and revisionist gentlemen have been completely exposed. The drama revolution has produced a rich harvest. The modern revolutionary Peking operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," "The Red Lantern," "The Sand Family," and "The Battle of the White-Headed Tigers," the modern revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl" and "The Red Detachment of Women," and the modern revolutionary symphony "The Sand Family" are the proletarian arts blooming in the thorny wilderness. They have declared the complete bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line, and they are a brilliant beginning of the new proletarian arts. Now, even the most stubborn "fortress" in the dramatic arts, which has been occupied by reactionary forces for hundreds of years and where counter-revolutionary revisionists have made desperate resistance, has been captured by the proletarian revolutionaries. What other fortresses can we not capture? Currently, the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought flying over the Peking opera fortress tells us: The proletarian cultural revolution will definitely be carried through to the end!

By comparing what has happened in other countries, one can fully understand the great significance of the drama revolution and other artistic forms. A year ago, in Moscow, I saw with my own eyes what role Soviet arts were playing today. There, novels, films, music, and ballets with bourgeois reactionary content were everywhere, and other decadent art forms were being vigorously promoted by the revisionist leadership to poison the people's thoughts, especially the thoughts of the youth. At that time, the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was being held. When the Soviet revisionists and other traitors—betrayers of Marxism-Leninism—who came to attend their congress went to "pay homage" to Lenin's tomb, a group of young people, obviously children of the privileged class, were swaying their heads and bodies to the accompaniment of a song that was obviously American-style, expressing their respect for American imperialism. This scene was not new to me: because at the "youth festival" organized by the revisionists in my country, the songs sung were also this kind of American popular music, not revolutionary songs.

If the proletarian cultural revolution had not been carried out, if the representatives of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes had been allowed to dominate the superstructure of society, what would have happened in China? It can almost be said for certain that the same thing would have happened as is happening today in the Soviet Union: the restoration of capitalism. From the great historical document—the May 16, 1966, Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China—it can be known that the most active group in the field of cultural thought, led by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Chinese Communist Party, was plotting a conspiracy. This biggest capitalist-roader within the Chinese Communist Party is precisely the main supporter of the bourgeois reactionary forces in the dramatic circle and the biggest obstacle to dramatic reform. This group of counter-revolutionary revisionists is preparing to carry out a Khrushchev-style coup, seize power, and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The proletarian cultural revolution in China has sounded the death knell for them.

Twenty-five years ago, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" first proposed the most complete, systematic, and correct program for the proletarian cultural revolution in the history of the proletarian revolution. It is the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and a brilliant document in the history of human culture.

A year ago, in the historically significant Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao proposed the theory, line, policy, and principles of the proletarian cultural revolution, solving the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Over the past year, the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories. The publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the brilliant victory of the proletarian cultural revolution in China mark the end of the ruling of the exploiting classes over the superstructure of society. They have opened up a new era and a new stage of socialism, in which the proletariat not only changes the economic base but also the entire superstructure of society, transitioning to the victory of communism. Today, China's proletarian cultural revolution shows the people of the world the inevitable path to thoroughly defeat imperialism and revisionism and build a new world—a communist world.

The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the Chinese stage. The characters of the old era helplessly watch the end of the old world, while the flowers of proletarian revolutionary arts are blooming, and the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the stage. All ghosts and monsters, all evil spirits have disappeared into the darkness and will never return. Let me shout with joy, the flowers of proletarian revolutionary arts have reached the season of full bloom!

    无产阶级革命文艺百花盛开的时节
    意大利　曼利奥·迪努齐
    我怀着激动的心情观看了革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。剧中的一幕使我联想到不久前我在报纸上看到的一张照片：美国侵略者在殴打一位越南南方姑娘。这位长着一头黝黑长发的姑娘全力反抗着。我想，时到今日，她受苦受难，和喜儿一样，头发该变白了；不过，现在她也许正在丛林中，和游击队员并肩作战，为祖国的解放而斗争。喜儿的故事正在现实中重演。
    过去，日本帝国主义、国民党和地主压迫中国人民，如今，美帝国主义和它的傀儡对越南人民进行罪恶的侵略行动。但是，哪里有压迫，哪里就有造反。在越南，成千上万个“喜儿”站起来了，她们给侵略者以致命打击；在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲，在全世界，面临着帝国主义和反动派的剥削和压迫，千百万个“喜儿”起来造反了。因此，舞台上演的是喜儿的故事，我在喜儿身上看到的却是在越南稻田里作战的女游击队员、从新殖民主义者手中夺过鞭子的非洲姑娘、在侵略者刺刀面前痛斥美帝国主义的南美女青年。我在喜儿身上看到的是所有为自己的解放、为建立一个没有剥削、没有压迫的新世界而斗争的被压迫者和穷苦人。这一切，我在《白毛女》中全看到了。
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中说：“文艺作品中反映出来的生活却可以而且应该比普通的实际生活更高，更强烈，更有集中性，更典型，更理想，因此就更带普遍性。革命的文艺，应当根据实际生活创造出各种各样的人物来，帮助群众推动历史的前进。”《白毛女》不但激励着中国观众，而且也激励着来自各大洲的人们，促使他们团结一致、共同战斗。这表明，《白毛女》体现了毛主席的文艺思想，这是真正的革命艺术。这也表明，毛主席关于文艺的论述是普遍的真理。
    当我从一个万里之遥的资本主义国家来到中国的时候，我对文艺没有很明确的概念，虽然我也曾经试图摆脱资产阶级学校灌输给我的错误观点。可以说，我正是通过当时首次上演的现代剧，第一次和中国有了深入的接触。来华后不久的一天晚上，我应邀前往观看现代京剧《智取威虎山》。起先我是打算到剧院里去消磨时间，“消遣消遣”。但是，我错了。从第一场起，我就发现，出现在我面前的是完全崭新的东西：舞台上的人物讲的是阶级斗争的语言、革命的语言、生活的语言。我看见，就在这个舞台上，我的革命思想感情具体化了。正是从那时起，我开始明白，艺术应该是什么样的。
    此后不久，另一件事给我留下了深刻印象，这次是个坏印象。看过若干革命戏剧和革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》以后，我有机会去观看一出传统戏。使我深有感触的不仅是舞台上演出的帝王将相、才子佳人的故事，而且还有剧院大厅里的人们。观众一点也不“活跃”，不象看革命剧目时那样，和剧中人物的经历交融在一起，为他们的经历而感动。五彩缤纷的戏装并没有驱除演员和观众中的冷漠气氛。
    上述对比使我懂得不少东西。我第一次真正懂得了毛主席的这些话：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这两段话以前我也读过，但是没有理解它们的深刻含意。我所看到的才子佳人故事难道是为工农兵而创作的吗？当然不是。多少年来，虽然人民在社会主义建设中乘胜前进，但是统治着剧院舞台的却是才子佳人和牛鬼蛇神。那时，好象有着两个世界：一个是现实世界，充满着生气和革命热忱；一个是戏剧世界，充斥着牛鬼蛇神。为什么戏剧世界不能反映现实世界呢？因为那时的戏剧世界是属于旧剥削阶级并反映了这些阶级的思想的。
    一九四四年，毛主席看了延安平剧院演出的《逼上梁山》后就指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。”但是，多年以来，在中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，以周扬为代表的一伙反革命修正主义分子顽固地对抗毛主席的这个指示，竭力抵制毛主席在《讲话》中提出的革命文艺路线。
    江青同志一贯坚持和保卫毛主席的革命文艺路线。多年来她高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，经过艰巨的斗争，在为创造革命现代京剧、革命现代芭蕾舞剧和革命现代交响音乐方面，做了一系列的革命的样板，使历史的真正创造者——工农兵群众的英雄形象第一次在舞台上大放光彩，使无产阶级的革命戏剧真正成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的宣传机器胡说什么中国的无产阶级文化大革命的目的就是破坏传统文艺和排斥外来文化。这是一种疯狂的污蔑。京剧、芭蕾舞、交响乐等的改革，执行了毛主席早已提出的对民族遗产和外来文化要“批判地吸收其中一切有益的东西”和“古为今用，洋为中用”的文艺方针。帝国主义者和修正主义老爷们的谎言彻底破产了。戏剧革命已经出现了一批丰盛的果实。现代革命京剧《智取威虎山》，《海港》，《红灯记》，《沙家浜》，《奇袭白虎团》，现代革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》、《红色娘子军》和现代革命交响音乐《沙家浜》，是在荆棘丛生的荒原上怒放着的无产阶级文艺的鲜花。它们宣判了反革命修正主义文艺路线彻底破产，它们是崭新的无产阶级文艺的一个光辉开端。现在，连反动势力盘踞了几百年之久，反革命修正主义分子赖以进行拚命抵抗的文艺阵地、戏剧艺术中最顽固的“堡垒”，也被无产阶级革命派攻克了，还有什么堡垒会拿不下来呢？目前，在京剧堡垒上迎风招展的毛泽东思想的红旗向我们宣告：无产阶级文化大革命一定能进行到底！
    和其他国家发生的事情作一个比较，便可以充分了解戏剧革命以及其他文艺形式的革命具有何等重要性。一年前，在莫斯科，我亲眼看见了今天的苏联文艺在起着什么作用。那里，到处充斥着具有资产阶级反动内容的小说、电影、音乐和芭蕾舞，到处充斥着修正主义领导集团为了毒害人民思想，特别是毒害青年思想而大力兜售的其他没落艺术形式。当时正在召开苏共二十三大，当苏联修正主义者和来参加他们大会的其他叛徒——马克思列宁主义的背叛者——去“谒见”列宁墓的时候，陵墓对面的商店里，一群年青人，显而易见是特权阶层子弟，却在一首显然是美国式的歌曲伴奏下，摇头晃脑地扭动，表示对美帝国主义的敬意。这种场面对我来说并不新鲜：因为在我国修正主义者所组织的“青年联欢节”上唱的也就是这类美国流行的靡靡之音，而不是革命歌曲。
    如果不进行无产阶级文化大革命，如果听任资产阶级和其他剥削阶级的代表人物统治社会的上层建筑，那么中国会发生什么事情呢？差不多可以肯定地说，也会发生今天在苏联所发生的一切：资本主义复辟。从伟大的历史文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》中可以知道，在文化思想领域最为活动的以中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的一小撮人在策划着一个什么阴谋。这个中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派正是戏剧界资产阶级反动势力的主要支持者，正是戏剧改革的最大障碍。这伙反革命修正主义分子准备实行赫鲁晓夫式的政变，篡夺政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。中国的无产阶级文化大革命敲响了他们的丧钟。
    二十五年前，毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，在无产阶级革命史上第一次提出了最完整、最系统、最正确的无产阶级文化革命的纲领，它是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，是人类文化史上划时代的光辉文献。
    一年前，在具有历史意义的中共中央《通知》中，毛主席提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。一年来，毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的发表和中国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，标志着剥削阶级对社会上层建筑的统治已经告终，它们开拓了一个新纪元，开拓了无产阶级不但改变经济基础而且也改变整个社会上层建筑，向共产主义胜利过渡的社会主义新阶段。今天，中国的无产阶级文化大革命给全世界革命人民指出了彻底打败帝国主义和修正主义，建设一个新世界——共产主义世界的必由之路。
    毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了中国的戏剧舞台。旧时代的剧中人物无可奈何地看着旧世界末日的到来，而无产阶级革命文艺的百花正在怒放，光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀着舞台，一切牛鬼蛇神，魑魅魍魉已经消失在黑暗中一去不复返了。让我纵情地欢呼，无产阶级革命文艺的百花已经到了盛开的时节！
