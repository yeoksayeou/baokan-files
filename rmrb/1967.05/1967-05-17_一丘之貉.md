At a time when the Suharto rightist military clique in Indonesia is actively currying favor with U.S. imperialism and frenziedly engaging in anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people activities, the Soviet revisionist leadership rushed to come out and eagerly whitewash this fascist regime.

The Soviet revisionist magazine *Novoye Vremya* published an article on April 26, which extensively discussed the so-called "extreme rightist forces" in Indonesia and how the Suharto regime is under attack and threat from these forces. According to the article, in Indonesia, only the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party are the "most reactionary forces," while the Suharto clique of rightist military personnel are supposedly engaged in "anti-imperialist struggle" and are implementing a "non-aligned policy." It even obliquely attempts to exonerate the Suharto regime, blaming the bloodbath of communists and patriots, as well as the betrayal of national interests to imperialism, on the pressure from the "extreme rightist forces." This is indeed a labor of love.

Everyone knows that the Suharto rightist military regime and parties like the Masyumi are thoroughly reactionary and are nothing but lackeys of imperialism. If there is any difference between them, it is that one group is a new batch of lackeys, while the other is an old batch; one group is the ruling lackeys, while the other is the opposition lackeys. The contradictions between them, as Chairman Mao once said when discussing the contradictions among Chinese reactionaries, are "nothing but a particularly interesting squabble between big dogs, small dogs, full dogs, and hungry dogs." Today in Indonesia, the group that is being fostered by U.S. imperialism and is loyally serving U.S. imperialism is precisely the Suharto clique of rightist military personnel, this new and ruling batch of lackeys. The Soviet revisionist leadership deliberately makes a big fuss about the so-called "extreme rightist forces," merely to beautify this small group of fascists, attempting to dress them up as the "wise" faction among the reactionaries, and to spread illusions about the Suharto regime to the Indonesian people and the people of other countries, helping this counterrevolutionary regime maintain its shaky reactionary rule.

The Soviet revisionist clique plays these tricks not only to help U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries but also to cover up their own criminal collusion with the Indonesian reactionaries. Since the Suharto regime is not the "most reactionary force" in Indonesia, not a lackey of imperialism, and is instead a "hero" implementing "anti-imperialist" and "non-aligned" policies, then they have a reason to support it, right? Since the Suharto regime is facing the serious threat of the "extreme rightist forces" attempting to seize power, then they have a reason to provide even greater support, right?

However, the counterrevolutionary face of the Suharto regime has already been fully exposed. The more the Soviet revisionist clique tries to whitewash it, the more it exposes that they themselves are of the same stripe as these Indonesian reactionaries.

    一丘之貉
    正当印度尼西亚苏哈托右派军人政权积极投靠美帝国主义，疯狂反共、反华、反人民的时候，苏修领导集团急急忙忙跳出来竭力替这个法西斯政权涂脂抹粉。
    苏修《新时代》杂志在四月二十六日出版的一期上发表了一篇文章，大谈印尼的所谓“极右势力”如何嚣张，苏哈托政权如何受到这个所谓“极右势力”的攻击和威胁。按照它的说法，在印尼，只有马斯友美党和社会党是“最反动的势力”，而苏哈托这一伙右派军人集团，则是坚持“反帝斗争”的，是执行“不结盟政策”的。它甚至拐弯抹角地替苏哈托政权洗刷罪行，把它血腥屠杀共产党人和爱国者、向帝国主义出卖民族利益等等祸国殃民的行径，都归咎于“极右势力”的压力。真是可谓用心良苦。
    谁都知道，苏哈托右派军人政权和马斯友美党之类，都是彻头彻尾的反动派，都是不折不扣的帝国主义走狗。如果说它们之间有什么差别的话，那就是一群是新走狗，一群是老走狗，一群是当权的走狗，一群是在野的走狗。它们之间的一点矛盾，正如毛主席在谈到中国反动派之间的矛盾时曾经说过的，“这不过是大狗小狗饱狗饿狗之间的一点特别有趣的争斗”。今天在印尼，为美帝国主义所扶植并且忠心耿耿地为美帝国主义效劳的，正是苏哈托右派军人集团这一群新的、当权的走狗。苏修领导集团故意大做所谓“极右势力”的文章，无非是为了美化苏哈托这一小撮法西斯分子，企图把他们打扮成为反动派中的“明智派”，向印尼人民和其他各国人民散布对苏哈托政权的“幻想”，帮助这个反革命政权维护它摇摇欲坠的反动统治。
    苏修集团玩弄这种手法，不仅是要帮美帝国主义和印尼反动派的忙，也是为他们自己同印尼反动派勾结的罪恶行径打掩护。既然苏哈托政权还不是印尼“最反动的势力”，不是帝国主义的走狗，而且还是坚持“反帝的”、“不结盟”的政策的“英雄”，那末，他们给以支持不就有理由了吗？既然苏哈托政权面临着“极右势力”企图夺取政权的严重威胁，那末他们给以更大的支持，不就有理由了吗？
    但是，苏哈托政权的反革命面目，早已暴露无遗。苏修集团越是竭力给它粉饰，只能越加暴露他们自己同这些印尼反动派是一丘之貉。
