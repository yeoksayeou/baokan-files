A thunderous spring storm of opera revolution has brought a season of flourishing proletarian arts. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and the direct leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, a batch of excellent revolutionary modern Beijing operas have appeared on the socialist stage. “The Battle at Shanggang” is a prominent example. The success of “The Battle at Shanggang” is a great victory for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Chairman Mao said: “Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for them to use.” This is the fundamental direction of proletarian literature and art. To make literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the most important and fundamental principle is to embody and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Whether or not it embodies and propagates Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between socialist literature and art and revisionist literature and art. The success of “The Battle at Shanggang” lies in its use of the Beijing opera form to successfully create heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, vividly and correctly embodying Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically propagating Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great hymn to Mao Zedong Thought.

“The Battle at Shanggang” depicts a fragment of the Chinese people’s war of resistance against Japan, praising the great victory of the people’s war through the struggle of the military and people of the Shanggang area against the Japanese and puppet forces. It emphasizes armed struggle, correctly handling the relationship between armed and non-armed struggle, military and civilian relations, the arduousness of revolutionary struggle and revolutionary optimism, deeply embodying Chairman Mao’s brilliant thoughts on people’s war.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Without a people’s army, there is nothing.” “The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war.” “In China, without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, no victory for the revolution.” “The Battle at Shanggang” excellently embodies Chairman Mao’s brilliant thoughts.

Armed struggle is the main conflict in “The Battle at Shanggang.” Whether it is the collusion of the Japanese and puppet forces, the pursuit by Hu Chuanhui and Xiao Deyi, or the clever struggle by Ah Qing, the strategy by Comrade Chen, or the reprimand by Grandma Sha, all serve this main line, highlighting the importance of the people’s armed forces. The entire play praises the New Fourth Army soldiers, especially the platoon leader Guo Jian’guang, fully highlighting the decisive role of armed struggle.

Guo Jian’guang is a platoon leader of the New Fourth Army. In “The Battle at Shanggang,” he is portrayed as a representative of the people’s soldiers. He is an outstanding proletarian revolutionary warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as he appears, he shows a sublime spiritual realm. “The morning sun shines on Lake Tai, reeds bloom, rice fragrant, willows in rows...” Surveying the beautiful rivers and mountains, thinking of the people’s deep suffering, he expresses his passion: “Not an inch of the motherland’s soil will be yielded, how can the enemy’s arrogance be allowed?” Although he is injured, he thinks day and night of his comrades and superiors fighting bravely on the front lines, cares about the situation of the anti-sweeping struggle, and longs to return to the battlefield as soon as his wounds heal to “raise his arms and wield his sword to slay the wolves.”

In the reeds, Guo Jian’guang faces severe tests. In the face of difficulties such as lack of food and medicine, surging waves, enemy encirclement, and unclear situations, he believes in the Party, believes in the masses, and believes that perseverance in struggle means victory. He emphasizes Mao Zedong Thought at every turn, using Mao Zedong Thought to unify the soldiers’ thoughts. He uses the revolutionary traditions of the Red Army to educate the soldiers and uses the revolutionary optimistic spirit of “difficulties cannot frighten heroic men” to inspire the soldiers. He is decisive and firm, actively grasping and judging the enemy situation, calm and composed. He understands the soldiers’ “passionate” desire to “kill the enemy,” but as a political worker, he immediately considers “preventing the spread of impatience,” and thus decides, “to encourage the soldiers, to observe the overall situation, to await instructions, to firmly guard the reeds, to hold the guns in hand, to be calm and steadfast in the reeds.” He firmly believes that as long as “we unite and follow the Party, we can be as firm as a rock and tempered into steel.” Under Guo Jian’guang’s leadership, with the Party’s care and the people’s support, the wounded and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army broke through numerous difficulties, showing unyielding perseverance and the brave fighting spirit of taking the initiative to attack.

In the final three scenes, “Raid,” “Breakthrough,” and “Annihilation,” Guo Jian’guang is even more majestic and spirited. Through singing and martial arts, Guo Jian’guang’s heroic image is greatly elevated, fully displaying the wisdom, bravery, tenacity, and heroic nature of our people’s soldiers, showing the irresistible and invincible might of the people’s army armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

In “The Battle at Shanggang,” the lines of armed struggle and underground struggle are intertwined, with the latter always serving the former. Chairman Mao said: “In China, the main form of struggle is war, and the main organizational form is the army. Other things, such as the organization of the masses and the struggles of the masses, are also very important, indispensable, and must not be neglected, but they are all for the sake of war.” This clearly defines the relationship between armed struggle and other forms of struggle (including underground struggle). A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the former Beijing Municipal Committee attempted to reverse the relationship between armed struggle and underground struggle in the play. Through the resolute struggle of Comrade Jiang Qing and the revolutionary faction of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe, their plot was thoroughly foiled.

“The Battle at Shanggang” concentrates its efforts on highlighting Guo Jian’guang’s image and the role of armed struggle, but it does not diminish the role of underground struggle or the image of the underground liaison officer Ah Qing. Instead, it handles them more reasonably, more completely, and more in accordance with the true history of revolutionary struggle.

Ah Qing is a party’s underground worker. She is loyal to the Party and the people. She is clever and brave, skilled in grasping Chairman Mao’s strategic thoughts, using contradictions, and splitting the enemy, effectively coordinating with the New Fourth Army’s struggle against the Japanese and puppet forces. Because she has armed forces as her backing and the support of the revolutionary masses, her activities have a reliable foundation and clear meaning, and her heroic image leaves a deeper impression on people.

While correctly embodying the relationship between armed struggle and underground struggle, “The Battle at Shanggang” enthusiastically praises the relationship between the military and the people. The New Fourth Army and the revolutionary masses’ inseparable, life-and-death, and familial relationship is fully displayed in “The Battle at Shanggang.” In the second scene, “Transfer,” the New Fourth Army platoon leader Guo Jian’guang and the representative of the revolutionary masses, Grandma Sha, have a duet. Guo Jian’guang praises Grandma Sha in the form of “giving advice”: “You treat comrades as family, carefully nursing them without fail...” Grandma Sha lovingly does not want the wounded soldiers to leave her home, wanting to raise them to be “as strong as black iron towers, then strong and powerful, riding horses...” The next line is sung by Guo Jian’guang: “Galloping in Jiangnan to kill the enemy...” and with great passion says: “When the clouds clear and the sun rises, every family will hang the red flag, and then come to visit you, this old revolutionary mother.” This lively and humorous duet, along with Guo Jian’guang’s unrestrained and childlike performance in front of Grandma Sha, and the detailed descriptions of the military and people helping each other, caring for each other, and encouraging each other, vividly shows the loving relationship between the military and the people, the deep class feelings, and the inseparable and intimate bone-and-flesh relationship. The people are willing to sacrifice everything to protect the wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army, risking their lives to send food and intelligence to the New Fourth Army, which is touching. Especially the representative of the people, Grandma Sha, she has unlimited admiration for the Party and the people’s army, and unbounded hatred for the enemy. She fears no violence and is ready to die. “Fortunately, the comrades have escaped danger, even if my body is crushed, I am willing.” These lyrics fully express her noble qualities. She dares to sing praises to the Communist Party and the New Fourth Army in front of the enemy, and with boundless anger, denounces the Japanese, puppet forces, and traitors, truly angry and righteous! With such revolutionary masses supporting our army, we can be invincible. This is the fundamental guarantee for the inevitable victory of revolutionary armed struggle.

The struggle of the New Fourth Army in Shanggang is very arduous. However, “The Battle at Shanggang” does not exaggerate the “terror” and “suffering” of war but correctly handles the relationship between the arduousness of revolutionary struggle and revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism. While showing the New Fourth Army’s soldiers’ spirit of hard struggle and brave sacrifice, it more prominently shows their revolutionary optimism and revolutionary heroism. In those arduous days, they are full of confidence in victory, “to learn from the pine tree on the top of Mount Tai, standing proudly against the sky. Eight thousand miles of storms cannot blow it down, nine thousand thunderbolts cannot crush it.” The more arduous the struggle, the more “vibrant and vigorous, tenacious and towering.” They are all spirited and full of fighting spirit. What a magnificent spirit, what a tenacious will! This fully embodies the people’s army’s heroic spirit of “to overcome all enemies and never be subdued by the enemy”! This is the heroic image of the people’s army created by Chairman Mao! This is a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements who advocate “heresy” and exaggerate the “terror” of war!

The appearance of “The Battle at Shanggang” and other revolutionary model plays is like a rolling spring thunder shaking the earth. It proclaims that the stage once occupied by emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, dead foreigners, and ghosts and monsters has been seized by the creators of history—the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers, proclaiming the bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, and the beginning of a new era of proletarian literature and art.

The historical reversal of the Beijing opera stage has been reversed by us, the proletarian revolutionary faction! This is the great victory of the Beijing opera revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, the great victory of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary literary and artistic line, and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    京剧革命的一声春雷
    ——评革命现代京剧样板戏《沙家浜》
    中国人民大学三红文学兵团
    京剧革命一声春雷，带来了无产阶级文艺百花盛开的季节。在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露的培育下，在江青同志的直接领导下，一批优秀的革命现代京剧样板戏出现在社会主义的舞台上。《沙家浜》就是其中突出的一个。《沙家浜》的成功，是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！
    毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这是无产阶级文艺的根本方向。要使文艺为工农兵服务，最重要、最根本的一条就是要体现、宣传毛泽东思想。是不是体现、宣传毛泽东思想，这是区别社会主义文艺还是修正主义文艺的分水岭。《沙家浜》之所以成功，就是因为它用京剧的形式，成功地塑造了工农兵英雄形象，生动地、形象地、正确地体现了毛泽东思想，热情地宣传了毛泽东思想。这是一曲毛泽东思想的伟大颂歌。
    《沙家浜》写的是中国人民抗日战争的一个片断，它通过沙家浜地区军民对日、伪军的斗争的描写，满腔热情地歌颂了人民战争的伟大胜利。它突出了武装斗争，正确地处理了武装斗争和非武装斗争的关系，军民关系，革命斗争的艰苦性和革命的乐观主义的关系，深刻地体现了毛主席的人民战争的光辉思想。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”《沙家浜》出色地体现了毛主席这一光辉思想。
    武装斗争是《沙家浜》矛盾冲突的主线。无论是日伪的《勾结》，胡传葵、刁德一的搜捕，还是阿庆嫂的《智斗》，陈书记的《授计》，沙奶奶的《斥敌》，都是为了服务于这根主线，突出这根主线，突出人民武装力量的重要性。全剧从正面歌颂了新四军战士、特别是指导员郭建光，充分突出了武装斗争的决定性作用。
    郭建光是新四军的连队指导员，在《沙家浜》中，他是被作为人民子弟兵的代表来着力表现、歌颂的。他是一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的优秀的无产阶级革命战士。他一“亮相”，就显示了崇高的精神境界。“朝霞映在阳澄湖上，芦花放，稻谷香，岸柳成行。……”环视大好的锦绣河山，联想到人民的深重灾难，他抒发出了“祖国河山寸土不让，岂容日寇逞凶狂”的激情。他虽然有伤在身，但日夜想念着在前方英勇杀敌的战友和首长，记挂着反“扫荡”的斗争形势，渴望着早日伤愈重返战场“奋臂挥刀斩豺狼”。歌声中，一个热爱祖国，热爱人民，一心为革命，一切为人民的无产阶级革命英雄战士的高大形象，出现在我们面前。
    在芦苇荡坚持斗争中，郭建光经受了严峻的考验。在粮尽药缺、浪激水淹和敌人包围封锁、情况不明的困难情况下，他相信党，相信群众，相信坚持斗争就是胜利。他处处突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来统一战士的思想。他用红军的革命传统来教育战士，用“困难吓不倒英雄汉”的革命乐观主义精神来鼓舞战士。他果断、坚定，在困难、复杂的情况下，主动掌握、判断敌情，有条不紊，指挥若定。他体谅战士们“慷慨激昂”“要杀敌人”的心情，但作为政治工作者，他又马上考虑到“要防止焦躁的情绪蔓延滋长”，于是下定决心，“要鼓励战士，察全局，等指示，坚守待命，紧握手中枪，要沉着冷静坚守在芦荡”。他坚信，只要“团结在一起心向党，就能够坚如磐石，百炼成钢”。在郭建光的带领下，在党的关怀和群众的支持下，新四军伤病员冲破了重重困难，表现了坚韧不拔的顽强意志和主动进攻的英勇战斗精神。
    在《奔袭》、《突破》、《聚歼》这最后三场戏中，郭建光更是气宇轩昂，神采奕奕。通过演唱和武打，大大地提高了郭建光的英雄形象，充分表现了我人民子弟兵机智、勇敢、顽强善战的英雄本色，显示了用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队的锐不可挡、必置敌人于死地的无穷威力。
    《沙家浜》中武装斗争和地下斗争这两条线是交织在一起的，而后者总是为前者服务的。毛主席说：“在中国，主要的斗争形式是战争，而主要的组织形式是军队。其他一切，例如民众的组织和民众的斗争等等，都是非常重要的，都是一定不可少，一定不可忽视，但都是为着战争的。”这就明确地规定了武装斗争和其他一切形式的斗争（包括地下斗争）的主从关系。旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子为了把这个戏引向歧途，曾经企图颠倒剧中的武装斗争和地下斗争的关系。经过江青同志和北京京剧一团无产阶级革命派的坚决斗争，他们的阴谋遭到了彻底的破产。
    《沙家浜》，集中力量突出了郭建光的形象，突出了武装斗争的作用，但并没有抹煞地下斗争的作用，也没有减损地下联络员阿庆嫂的形象，而是处理得更合理，更完整，更符合革命斗争历史的真实。
    阿庆嫂是我党的地下工作者。她忠于党，忠于人民。她机智勇敢，善于掌握毛主席的策略思想，利用矛盾，分化敌人，很好地配合了新四军对日、伪的斗争。由于她有武装力量作后盾，有广大革命群众的支持，她的活动就有了可靠的基础和明确的意义，她的英雄形象也就给人们留下了更为深刻的印象。
    《沙家浜》在正确体现武装斗争和地下斗争关系的同时，热情地歌颂了军民关系。新四军和革命群众的息息相关、生死与共、亲如家人的关系，在《沙家浜》里得到了淋漓尽致的表现。第二场《转移》，新四军指导员郭建光和革命群众代表沙奶奶有一段连唱。郭建光用“提意见”的方式，夸沙奶奶：“你待同志亲如一家，经心调理总不差……”。沙奶奶则爱抚地不肯让伤病员离开她的家，要把他们养得“一个个象座黑铁塔，到那时，身强力壮跨战马……”，下一句则由郭建光唱出：“驰骋江南把敌杀……”，并满怀激情地说：“等到云开日出，家家把那红旗挂，再来探望你这个革命的老妈妈。”这一段风趣活泼的连唱，加上郭建光在沙奶奶面前那种无拘无束的带孩子气的表演，以及军民互相帮助，互相体贴，互相鼓励的细节描写，生动地表现了军爱民，民拥军，军民一家，亲密无间的骨肉关系和深厚的阶级感情。人民群众不惜牺牲自己的一切来掩护新四军的伤病员，冒着生命危险给新四军送粮食，送情报，更是感人肺腑。特别是人民群众的代表沙奶奶，她对党、对人民军队无限拥戴，对敌人无比仇恨。她不畏强暴，视死如归。“且喜亲人已脱险，粉身碎骨也心甘。”这两句唱词充分表现了她的高贵品质。她敢于在敌人面前满怀激情地歌颂共产党、新四军，满腔怒火地痛斥日寇、伪军、汉奸卖国贼，真是怒发冲冠，气壮山河！我们的军队有这样的革命群众的支持，就能无敌于天下。这是革命的武装斗争必然取得胜利的根本保证。
    新四军在沙家浜的斗争是非常艰苦的。但是《沙家浜》并没有去渲染战争的“恐怖”和“苦难”，而是正确地处理了革命斗争的艰苦性和革命的乐观主义、革命的英雄主义的关系，在表现了新四军指战员艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲精神的同时，更加突出地表现了他们的革命乐观主义和革命英雄主义精神。在那艰苦的日子里，他们充满必胜的信心，“要学那泰山顶上一青松，挺然屹立傲苍穹。八千里风暴吹不倒，九千个雷霆也难轰。”越是艰苦，越是“蓬勃旺盛，倔强峥嵘”。他们个个英姿勃发，斗志昂扬。这是何等宏伟的气魄，何等顽强的斗志！这就充分地体现了人民军队“要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的英雄气概！这才是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队的英雄群象。这是对鼓吹“离经叛道”论和渲染战争“恐怖”的反革命修正主义分子的沉重打击！
    《沙家浜》和其他革命样板戏的出现，象滚滚春雷震动大地。它宣告了被帝王将相、才子佳人、死人洋人、牛鬼蛇神所盘踞的舞台，已为创造历史的主人——工农兵的英雄人物所占领，宣告了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的破产，宣告了无产阶级文艺新纪元的开始。
    京剧舞台历史的颠倒已由我们无产阶级革命派再颠倒过来了！这是江青同志所领导的京剧革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
