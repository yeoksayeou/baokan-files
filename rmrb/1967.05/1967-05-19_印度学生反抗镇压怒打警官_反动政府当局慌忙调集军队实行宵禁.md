In the eastern Indian state of Assam, in the town of Tezpur in Darrang District, on the morning of the 8th, an incident occurred where police insulted and arbitrarily arrested students. This event enraged a large number of students, and several thousand angry students gathered in front of the police station to protest, demanding the release of the arrested students. The reactionary Indian government dispatched a large number of police to suppress the protest and opened fire, killing three students and injuring many others. The protesting students threw stones, damaging the police station, injuring the Darrang District Deputy Commissioner, the Assistant Police Station Chief, the police inspector, and many police officers. They also set fire to the Deputy Commissioner's car, a police van, and three fire trucks. The reactionary government hastily called in troops from outside to assist local civil authorities in suppressing the people and imposed a curfew on the entire town.
