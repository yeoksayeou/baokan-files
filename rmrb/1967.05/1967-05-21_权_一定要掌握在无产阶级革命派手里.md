One year ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally oversaw the formulation of the great historical document, the "Communist Party of China Central Committee Notification," which thoroughly smashed the conspiracy of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. Today, we have exposed the biggest group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and the seven hundred million people have launched a great criticism movement against them. This has also shattered the imperialists' dream that "in the not-too-distant future, China's leaders might adopt a 'wise' attitude like that of the Soviet Union today." This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

For a long time, our sports department has been seized by a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. With the support of the biggest group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they have used "material incentives," "personal gain first," "championship first," and other revisionist poisons to lure our youth into the dead end of "individual struggle." They have been trying to restore capitalism in the sports world. After the start of the Cultural Revolution, we stood up to expose them and launched a great struggle against revisionism. They then organized some uninformed masses to attack us, accusing us of "rejecting the Party's leadership" and "shooting the cannon at the proletarian headquarters." Why were they so arrogant? It was because they had seized the leadership of the sports department. At the end of last year, knowing that they were about to collapse, they issued large amounts of travel expenses, stirring up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, attempting to lure the masses to go out in large numbers and disrupt the socialist economy to avoid the criticism and struggle of the broad masses. They were able to use various means to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because they held the power. In fact, they were practicing the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat. The sharp and complex class struggle we are waging against this small group of people is, in essence, a struggle over power.

In the great storm of the "January Revolution," we, along with the broad masses of revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, seized the power from a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists and took control of the sports department's seal. Seizing power is not easy, but holding and using power properly is even more difficult. The victory in the struggle for power does not mean that the question of who wins and who loses in the revolution has been completely resolved. After the victory in the struggle for power, in order to hold and use power properly, we must pay special attention to self-reform, strengthen ideological education, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, carry out a revolution in the depths of our souls, and while transforming the objective world, also transform our subjective world. At the same time as we seize the power from the small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must ruthlessly seize the power of the "self" in our minds. Otherwise, it would be very dangerous. Among the small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party, there are some who have come through the long and arduous years of revolutionary warfare, but later they became detached from the masses, detached from reality, lived in luxury, and were hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. This is a serious lesson. If we relax the transformation of our subjective world after the victory in the struggle for power, we will make great mistakes, and we might even be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. If we go on like this, capitalism might be restored, and the proletarian dictatorship state might still change color.

"Now, the Cultural Revolution is only the first one; in the future, it must be carried out many times. Comrade Mao Zedong has often said in recent years that the question of who wins and who loses in the revolution will be resolved over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism may be imminent at any time. All Party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will ensure peace and tranquility forever. Be extremely vigilant and never relax your guard."

Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions are indeed very important. We revolutionary rebels of the proletariat must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously and diligently reform our worldview, hold and use power properly, uphold the proletarian dictatorship, uphold the socialist direction, and firmly grasp in our own hands the destiny of the proletarian dictatorship, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy. We must forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and forever be good students of Chairman Mao.

    “权”一定要掌握在无产阶级革命派手里
    上海体育战线革命造反司令部鲁迅兵团东方红战斗队
    一年以前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的伟大的历史文件中共中央《通知》，彻底粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团的阴谋。今天，我们把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来，七亿人民对他们展开了大批判运动。这使得帝国主义的“希望不久的将来，中国的领导人能够采取象现在苏联那样的‘明智’的态度”的梦想也彻底破产了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级专政的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    我们运动系长期以来被一小撮反革命修正主义分子窃取了领导权。在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，他们用“物质刺激”、“名利第一”、“锦标第一”等等修正主义的毒剂，引诱我们青少年钻入“个人奋斗”的死胡同。他们在体育界大搞资本主义复辟。文化大革命开始以后，我们起来揭露他们，大造修正主义的反。他们就组织一些不明真相的群众，围攻我们，诬蔑我们“不要党的领导”，“炮打无产阶级司令部”……为什么他们能够这样猖狂呢？就是因为运动系的领导权被他们窃踞了。去年底，他们知道自己即将垮台，便大肆发放串连费，刮起反革命经济主义的妖风，企图诱骗群众大批外出，破坏社会主义的经济，以逃避广大群众对他们进行批判斗争。他们所以能够采取各种手段，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，就因为权在他们手里。实际上，他们实行的就是资产阶级对无产阶级的专政。我们同这一小撮人进行的这场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是权的问题。
    在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，我们同广大的无产阶级革命派一样，夺了一小撮反革命修正主义分子的权，掌了运动系的大印。夺权固然不容易，而掌好权、用好权更不容易。夺权斗争的胜利，并不等于革命的谁胜谁负问题已经完全解决。在夺权斗争胜利以后，为了掌好权、用好权，我们必须特别注意自我思想改造，加强思想教育，破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命，在改造客观世界的同时改造自己的主观世界，在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，狠夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。否则，就是很危险的。在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派中间，有一些人是从长期革命战争的艰苦岁月里走过来的，但是，他们后来脱离群众，脱离实际，养尊处优，被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中了。这是一个严重的教训。如果我们在夺权斗争胜利以后，放松主观世界的改造，我们就会犯绝大的错误，甚至自己也可能被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹打中。这样下去，资本主义还可能复辟，无产阶级专政的国家仍有变色的危险。
    “现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。毛泽东同志近几年经常说，革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”
    伟大领袖毛主席对我们的这个最新指示，实在太重要了。我们无产阶级革命派一定要努力活学活用毛主席著作，认真地刻苦地改造自己的世界观，掌好权、用好权，坚持无产阶级专政，坚持社会主义的大方向，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧地掌握在自己的手里。我们一定要永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远做毛主席的好学生。
