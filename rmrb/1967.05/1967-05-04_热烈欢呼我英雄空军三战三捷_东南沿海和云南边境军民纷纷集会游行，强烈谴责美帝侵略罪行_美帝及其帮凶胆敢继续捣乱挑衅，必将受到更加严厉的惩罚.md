Our heroic air force units achieved three victories in three battles in the skies over a certain location in Guangxi. The news has greatly inspired the broad masses of military and civilian personnel on the border and coastal defense lines in southeastern coastal regions and the Yunnan border. In recent days, they have held meetings and parades, warmly celebrating this great victory and strongly condemning the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism in repeatedly violating our airspace and brazenly bombing and shelling the southern part of Ningming County, Guangxi. They solemnly warn the American aggressors: The Chinese people, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, are not to be trifled with. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, with a hundredfold increase in revolutionary fighting spirit, are on high alert and ready for battle. If U.S. imperialism and its accomplices dare to continue causing trouble and provoking, they will surely receive even more severe punishment.

After the news of the People's Air Force's victories spread, from island fishing villages to border hamlets, from naval docks to mountain outposts, everywhere was filled with joy. The heroic coastal defense military and civilian personnel shouted in unison: "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!" The news reached Hainan Island, which faces the Democratic Republic of Vietnam across the sea. Fishermen who had just returned from production in the Beibu Gulf held meetings to warmly congratulate the People's Air Force on shooting down enemy planes, a great victory, and combined their personal experiences to denounce the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. The soldiers of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding the southern tip of the island immediately held a celebration on their positions, warmly celebrating the great victory of their brother units, and combined with the situation, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on increasing vigilance. They decided to learn from the units that had fought bravely, to be even more vigilant, and to be ready for battle. If the U.S. imperialists dare to attack, they will be smashed to smithereens!

The news reached the front-line islands of Fujian. The local people and the broad masses of soldiers and officers on duty at the front-line outposts, artillery positions, and ships were overjoyed and immediately spread the word, warmly celebrating this as a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory of the boundless flames of Mao Zedong Thought. The militia of Lingdou Production Brigade in Xiamen Frontline Commune, upon hearing the news of the heroic air force units' consecutive victories, immediately held a meeting, expressing their determination to strictly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, humbly learn from the PLA, and be a powerful assistant to the PLA. The military and civilians will fight side by side to forge the island into an iron wall and defend the iron mountains and rivers of the motherland. The news reached the coast of Zhejiang, where representatives of a certain naval unit attending a conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works warmly shouted: "Well done! Hit them hard!" Active learner of Chairman Mao's works, a certain unit's commander Jiang Kai, who had shot down an invading U.S.-made Kuomintang plane, said: U.S. imperialism has long been our defeated enemy. However, as Chairman Mao taught: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." U.S. imperialism will never change its nature. We must solemnly warn the American aggressors: The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincibly strong. We have long laid a net of heaven and earth. No matter if you come from the sky, the sea, or the land, we will resolutely fight, fight hard, fight until you are covered in blood, fight until you come and never return.

The news of victory reached the Yunnan border, which shares mountains and rivers with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Dai, Jingpo, and other ethnic peoples and local troops danced and sang, warmly celebrating the air force units' great victory of shooting down five enemy planes. The news reached the Awa Mountains, where local troops and Awa militia held a meeting together to celebrate this glorious victory. After reading Chairman Mao's quotations about imperialism and all reactionaries being paper tigers, the military and civilians jointly condemned the heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism. Awa militia squad leader Yan Song said: U.S. imperialism has repeatedly violated our airspace, fully proving that the nature of imperialism will never change. For dogs, you need a stick; for wolves, you need a rifle. If the wolf of U.S. imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, we will, together with the PLA, completely annihilate them!

    据新华社三日讯　我英雄空军部队在广西某地上空三战三捷的喜讯传到东南沿海和云南边境地区，给了边防海防线上的广大军民极大鼓舞。连日来，他们纷纷集会游行，热烈欢呼这一重大胜利，愤怒谴责美帝国主义连续侵犯我国领空，并悍然在我广西宁明县南部地区投弹轰炸的滔天罪行。他们严正警告美国强盗：用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，不是好惹的。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，百倍增强了革命战斗精神的中国人民和人民解放军，正百倍警惕，严阵以待。如果美帝国主义及其帮凶，胆敢继续捣乱、挑衅，必将受到更加严厉的惩罚。
    人民空军的捷报传出后，从海岛渔村到边疆村寨，从海军码头到高山哨卡，到处一片欢腾。英雄的海边防军民同声高呼：“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”喜讯传到和越南民主共和国隔海相望的海南岛，刚从北部湾海上生产回港的渔民，纷纷集会，热烈祝贺人民空军击落敌机的伟大胜利，并结合自己的亲身遭遇，控诉美帝国主义的滔天罪行。守卫在天涯海角的某高炮部队，指战员们当即在阵地上举行庆祝会，热烈欢呼兄弟部队的伟大胜利，并结合形势，反复学习毛主席关于提高警惕性的教导，他们决心向作战有功部队学习，更加百倍警惕，严阵以待，美帝国主义胆敢来犯，就打它个稀巴烂！
