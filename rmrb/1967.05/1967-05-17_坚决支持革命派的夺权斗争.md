We are taught by Chairman Mao that: “The dictatorship of the revolution and the dictatorship of the counter-revolution are diametrically opposed, but the former learns from the latter. This learning is very important. If the revolutionary people do not learn this method of ruling over the counter-revolutionary class, they will not be able to maintain the power, and their power will be overthrown by the internal and external reactionaries, the internal and external reactionaries will restore capitalism in China, and the revolutionary people will suffer.”

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in his several reprints and re-editions of “On Cultivation,” does not mention proletarian dictatorship, does not mention the real class struggle, does not mention the revolutionary people implementing revolutionary dictatorship against the revolutionary enemies. The purpose is to make the people of our country forget about class struggle, forget about proletarian dictatorship, make people the more they “cultivate” the more they “modify,” turn into revisionism; it is to restore capitalism in our country, implement bourgeois dictatorship, make the power seized by the broad laboring people with their blood and lives be lost again, make the broad laboring people become beasts of burden and slaves again.

Comrade Lin Biao says: “Power is the power to suppress.” This is absolutely true. Whether the power is in the hands of the bourgeoisie or in the hands of the proletariat, it is the same. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, countless revolutionary youngsters responded to Chairman Mao’s call and launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. The problems exposed by the revolutionary youngsters hit the sore spots of the handful of bad guys, so they suppressed the revolutionary mass movement, labeled the revolutionary vanguards as “counter-revolutionaries,” and implemented bourgeois white terror. Why can they do this? It is because they still hold a part of the power they have usurped.

Countless facts have educated us, making us realize: the fundamental issue of all revolutions is the issue of power. This is an unshakeable truth. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is, in the final analysis, an extremely sharp and complex struggle for power.

Our country’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. As the pillar of proletarian dictatorship, all the soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army guard their battle positions, vigilantly defend the country’s borders and coastal defenses, are ready at any time to annihilate all enemies who dare to invade, and ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At the same time, according to Chairman Mao’s wise instructions, the People’s Liberation Army has directly intervened in the Cultural Revolution, resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction in their struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. In this way, the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction is greatly boosted, and the arrogance of the bourgeoisie is greatly crushed. With the support of the People’s Liberation Army and the strong backing of proletarian dictatorship, the proletarian revolutionary faction can fully use the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions, fully exercise democratic rights, expose the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and their gang, fight them down, fight them to ruin, fight them to stink, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The People’s Liberation Army is the reliable pillar of proletarian dictatorship. The more the enemy opposes proletarian dictatorship, the more we must strengthen proletarian dictatorship. We must hold the gun tightly, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    坚决支持革命派的夺权斗争

    毛主席教导我们说：“革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。这个学习很要紧。革命的人民如果不学会这一项对待反革命阶级的统治方法，他们就不能维持政权，他们的政权就会被内外反动派所推翻，内外反动派就会在中国复辟，革命的人民就会遭殃。”
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在他几次重印和再版的《修养》里，闭口不提无产阶级专政，不提现实的阶级斗争，不提革命的人民向着革命的敌人实行革命的专政，目的就是要使我国人民忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，使人们越“养”越“修”，变成修正主义；就是要在我国复辟资本主义，实行资产阶级专政，使我国人民用鲜血和生命夺取的政权重新丧失掉，让广大的劳动人民重新当牛马、做奴隶。
    林彪副主席说：“政权就是镇压之权”。这是千真万确的。不管政权是掌握在资产阶级手里，还是掌握在无产阶级手里，都是这样。无产阶级文化大革命
  中，无数革命小将响应毛主席的号召，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。革命小将揭发的问题，触到一小撮坏家伙的痛处，他们就对革命的群众运动大加镇压，把革命闯将打成“反革命”，实行资产阶级的白色恐怖。他们为什么能够这样干？就是因为他们还掌握着一部分被他们篡夺了的政权。
    无数事实教育了我们，使我们认识到：一切革命的根本问题是政权问题，这是一个颠扑不破的真理。无产阶级文化大革命，归根到底，就是一场极其尖锐、复杂的夺权斗争。
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的大革命。作为无产阶级专政的支柱，解放军的全体战士，坚守自己的战斗岗位，警惕地保卫着祖国的边防和海防，随时准备消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人，保证了无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行。同时，根据毛主席的英明指示，解放军又直接介入了文化大革命，坚决支持无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺权的斗争。这样，就大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。有了人民解放军的支持，有强大的无产阶级专政作靠山，无产阶级革命派就能够充分运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，充分行使民主权利，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他的一伙揪出来，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    人民解放军是无产阶级专政的可靠柱石。敌人越是反对无产阶级专政，我们越是要加强无产阶级专政。我们要把枪杆子握得紧紧的，捍卫无产阶级专政，捍卫无产阶级文化大革命。
