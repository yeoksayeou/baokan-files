The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Issues a Statement
Strongly Protesting the Anti-China Atrocities by the Mongolian Revisionist Group
Demanding the Mongolian Government to Publicly Admit Its Mistakes, Immediately Release All Detained Chinese Citizens, Severely Punish the Perpetrators and Masterminds, and Compensate for All Losses

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th

On the afternoon of the 27th, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Mongolian Embassy in China, Ba Ga, to hand over a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, strongly protesting the atrocities committed by the Mongolian revisionist leadership group in violation of international relations norms, worsening bilateral relations, assaulting and detaining Chinese diplomatic personnel and Xinhua News Agency staff, and brutally persecuting Chinese nationals. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
May 27, 1967

On the afternoon of May 21st, the Mongolian government orchestrated a savage anti-China bloodshed incident at the Ulaanbaatar Railway Station. A large number of armed police and plainclothes agents, personally directed by the Deputy Director of the Mongolian State Police Bureau, Ailin Qinghe'erluo, brutally attacked and beat Chinese personnel who were at the station to see off three Chinese teachers unjustly expelled by the Mongolian side. Many people were injured on the spot, and more than twenty Chinese nationals were arrested after being beaten.

More seriously, the Mongolian government allowed the police and secret agents to assault and illegally detain Chinese Embassy and Xinhua News Agency personnel present at the scene. Among them were two third-secretaries, two attachés, and one staff member each from the Chinese Embassy and the Xinhua News Agency. The camera of the Xinhua News Agency staff was also seized by the Mongolian side.

When the incident occurred, the First Deputy Minister of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, Tuoyifu, was at the station directing from behind the scenes. The Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia rushed to the scene to negotiate with him, but he evaded the meeting.

The anti-China bloodshed incident at the Ulaanbaatar Railway Station was a premeditated and organized act by the Mongolian government. It was a serious violation of the personal safety of Chinese diplomatic personnel, a brutal persecution of Chinese nationals, and a severe political provocation by the Mongolian revisionist leadership group in pursuit of the Soviet revisionists, crazily opposing China. The Chinese people and the Chinese government express great indignation and strongly protest against this fascist atrocity by the Mongolian government.

The Mongolian revisionist leadership group has always followed the Soviet revisionists and fiercely opposed China. Especially in the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has severely struck at imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, greatly inspiring all revolutionary peoples. The Mongolian revisionist leadership group is extremely afraid of and hates the great thought of Mao Zedong. They have mobilized all their propaganda machinery to maliciously distort and crazily slander China's Cultural Revolution. They have repeatedly instigated thugs to smash the propaganda display windows of the Chinese Embassy, obstructed and hindered the Chinese Embassy's legitimate activities of distributing news bulletins and propaganda materials according to custom, unilaterally tore up the agreement on mutual exemption of visas between the two countries, and unreasonably restricted Chinese personnel from going to Mongolia to work. They have systematically and step-by-step worsened bilateral relations, attempting to weaken the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China among the Mongolian people, and to destroy the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Mongolia.

This time, the Mongolian revisionist leadership group unjustly expelled three Chinese teachers because these three Chinese teachers enthusiastically propagated the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to the children of Chinese nationals and the broad patriotic overseas Chinese. The Mongolian revisionist leadership group mobilized a large number of police and secret agents to brutally beat and illegally detain Chinese diplomatic personnel and Chinese citizens, fully exposing the Mongolian revisionist leadership group's willingness to act as the anti-China henchmen of the Soviet revisionists, and their evil intention to further worsen Sino-Mongolian relations.

We warn the Mongolian revisionist leadership group that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. All those who oppose China will ultimately "lift a stone to drop on their own feet" and will not have a good ending.

The Chinese government solemnly demands that the Mongolian government:

1. Publicly admit the mistakes of violating international relations norms, assaulting and detaining Chinese diplomatic personnel, and brutally persecuting Chinese nationals.

2. Immediately release all unjustly detained Chinese citizens; guarantee that the diplomatic privileges of Chinese diplomatic personnel will not be violated, guarantee that the legitimate rights and personal safety of Chinese nationals in Mongolia will not be violated, and ensure that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

3. Severely punish the perpetrators and masterminds, and compensate for all losses on the Chinese side.

If the Mongolian revisionist leadership group continues to follow the Soviet revisionists in their reckless actions, all serious consequences arising therefrom must be borne by the Mongolian government.

    我外交部发表声明
    最强烈抗议蒙修集团反华暴行
    严正要求蒙古政府公开承认错误，立即释放被捕的全部中国人，严惩肇事凶手和主使人，赔偿一切损失
    新华社二十七日讯　我国外交部副部长韩念龙，二十七日下午召见蒙古驻华大使馆临时代办巴嘎，面交我国外交部声明，最强烈抗议蒙古修正主义领导集团破坏国际关系准则，恶化两国关系，殴打、扣押中国外交人员和新华分社人员，残酷迫害华侨的法西斯暴行。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                  一九六七年五月二十七日
    一九六七年五月二十一日下午三时三十分，蒙古政府在乌兰巴托火车站制造了一场野蛮的反华流血事件。由蒙古国家警察总局副局长艾林青浩尔洛亲临指挥的大批武装警察和便衣特务，对前往车站欢送被蒙方无理驱逐的三名华侨教师的中国人员，进行了野蛮的围攻殴打，当场打伤多人。遭毒打后，又被拘捕的华侨达二十余人。
    更为严重的是，蒙古政府竟纵容警察特务殴打和强行扣押了在场的中国大使馆和新华分社的人员，其中有三等秘书二人，随员二人，大使馆工作人员和新华分社工作人员各一人。新华社工作人员的照相机，也被蒙方抢走。
    事件发生时，蒙古外交部第一副部长托依夫就在车站进行幕后指挥，中国驻蒙大使馆临时代办闻讯赶赴现场找他交涉，他竟避而不见。
    乌兰巴托车站所发生的反华流血事件，是蒙古政府有计划、有组织地干出来的，是对中国外交人员人身安全的严重侵犯，是对中国侨民的残酷迫害，是蒙古修正主义领导集团追随苏修，疯狂反华的极为严重的政治挑衅事件。中国人民和中国政府，对于蒙古政府的这一法西斯暴行，表示极大的愤慨，并且提出最强烈的抗议。
    蒙古修正主义领导集团，一贯追随苏修，猖狂反华。特别是近一年来，中国的无产阶级文化大革命运动，严重地打击了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，极大地鼓舞了一切革命的人民。蒙古修正主义领导集团对于伟大的毛泽东思想更是怕得要死，恨得要命。他们开动了全部宣传机器，连篇累牍地肆意歪曲和疯狂诋毁中国的文化大革命，一再指使暴徒砸毁中国大使馆的宣传橱窗，多方刁难、阻挠中国大使馆按惯例分送新闻公报和宣传品的正当活动，片面撕毁两国互免签证协议，无理限制中国援蒙人员赴蒙施工。他们有计划、有步骤地不断恶化两国关系，妄图削弱伟大的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命在蒙古人民中的巨大影响，破坏中蒙两国人民间的传统友谊。
    这次蒙古修正主义领导集团无理驱逐三名华侨教师，就是因为这三名华侨教师向华侨子弟和广大爱国侨胞热情地宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想。蒙古修正主义领导集团，出动大批警察特务野蛮殴打和非法拘捕中国外交人员和中国公民，充分暴露了蒙古修正主义领导集团甘心充当苏联修正主义的反华走卒，蓄意进一步恶化中蒙两国关系的丑恶嘴脸。
    我们正告蒙古修正主义领导集团，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民不是好惹的。一切反华的人，到头来只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，绝对不会有什么好下场的。
    中国政府严正要求蒙古政府：
    一、对于蒙古政府破坏国际关系准则，殴打、扣押中国外交人员和残酷迫害华侨的罪行，公开承认错误。
    二、立即释放被无理拘捕的全部中国人；保证中国外交人员的外交特权不受侵犯，保证中国旅蒙侨民的正当权益和人身安全不受侵犯，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    三、严惩肇事凶手和主使人，赔偿中国方面的一切损失。
    如果蒙古修正主义领导集团继续追随苏联修正主义蛮干下去，由此产生的一切严重后果，必须由蒙古政府承担。
