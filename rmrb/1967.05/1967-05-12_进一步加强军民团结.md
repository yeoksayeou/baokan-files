Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao instructed us: We must believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army, and believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. Chairman Mao also called on us to support the army and love the people. This is our guideline for implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Every revolutionary comrade must firmly and unconditionally carry out this instruction.

The great People's Liberation Army is the people's army founded and led by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. They not only know how to fight but also how to do mass work, propaganda work, production work, and so on. At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive battle between the two classes and two lines, they have responded to Chairman Mao's call and resolutely carried out the five tasks of supporting the leftist broad masses, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military-political training. They have entered the front line of struggle with high morale, making the overall situation more favorable to the revolutionary masses. Their achievements are great, and their general direction is correct. This is the essence and mainstream of things. If we fail to see this, or even doubt it, we will make a mistake in direction.

The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad masses must always remember that the People's Liberation Army is the most important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is precisely because we have the People's Liberation Army, which is loyal to Chairman Mao and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, as a strong backing that we are able to launch this great proletarian cultural revolution that has shocked the world.

Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven that without the People's Liberation Army, it would be impossible to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; without the full support of the People's Liberation Army, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could not have achieved such glorious results today.

For this reason, the broad proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary masses have the greatest trust in the Liberation Army, love the Liberation Army the most, and work closely with it. They regard their attitude towards the Liberation Army as their attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat and towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The people have the greatest trust in and rely on the Liberation Army, and the Liberation Army also has the greatest trust in and relies on the people. Whether in the past or now, the Liberation Army has always regarded trusting and relying on the people as the most fundamental principle and placed it in the most important position.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "...As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is boundless, and thus trust the people and unite with them, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot defeat us, but will be defeated by us."

Seventeen years ago, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army, relying on the people, liberated all of China. Today, the People's Liberation Army must complete the great task of defending the socialist motherland and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Similarly, it must carry forward the glorious tradition of closely uniting with the people and realize the principle of "unity between the military and the people."

Firmly establishing the correct attitude towards the people is the key to successfully completing the tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training.

The cadres and soldiers of the Liberation Army must recognize that they are the sons of the people and the students of the masses, and must firmly believe in and rely on the masses. In doing anything, they must first consult with the masses, conduct investigations and research, and clarify things in front of the masses and fully discuss them among the masses. As long as they sincerely learn from the masses and humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, they can correctly identify the leftists and firmly support the leftists.

The cadres and soldiers of the Liberation Army must resolutely defend the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and bring the excellent tradition of the "three democracies" of the People's Liberation Army to the broad revolutionary masses. They must help the masses fully use the weapons of big debates, big posters, big character posters, and big discussions to present facts, reason, insist on struggle through debate, oppose struggle through violence, and through normal debates, affirm what is correct, rectify what is wrong, clarify major issues, and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought.

The people and the army, the army and the people, must always stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart, and resolutely carry out the Central Military Commission's eight-point directive of January 28 and the ten-point directive of April 6. The eight-point directive mainly emphasizes how the masses should correctly treat the People's Liberation Army and how the people should support the sons and daughters of the army. The ten-point directive mainly emphasizes how the People's Liberation Army should correctly treat the masses and how the people's army should love the people. The spirit of the ten-point directive and the eight-point directive is consistent. It is wrong to oppose the ten-point directive with the eight-point directive, and the ten-point directive must not be used to undermine the eight-point directive. If the ten-point directive is used to undermine the eight-point directive, that is wrong. The people's criticisms and suggestions of the army can be put forward in a friendly and appropriate manner, and the struggle must not be directed at the People's Liberation Army.

When the military and the people unite as one, who in the world can defeat us? The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a major battle. Relying on the broad revolutionary masses, the powerful People's Liberation Army, and the majority of revolutionary cadres, what difficulties and obstacles can stop us from continuing to advance victoriously? We will definitely win a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is certain and beyond doubt.

    进一步加强军民团结
    最近，我们伟大的领袖毛主席指示我们：要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数。毛主席还号召我们，拥军爱民。这是我们执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，实现革命的大联合和革命“三结合”的指导思想，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的根本保证。每一个革命同志，都必须坚定不移地、不折不扣地贯彻执行。
    伟大的人民解放军，是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席亲自指挥的人民军队。他们不仅会打仗，而且会做群众工作，宣传工作，生产工作，等等。他们在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条路线决战的关键时刻，响应毛主席的号召，坚决执行支持左派广大群众、支援工业、支援农业、军事管制、军政训练等五项任务。他们以高昂的战斗姿态投入了斗争第一线，使得整个形势向着对革命派更加有利的方面发展。他们的成绩是巨大的，大方向是正确的。这是事物的本质，事物的主流。我们如果看不到这一点，甚至怀疑这一点，那就要犯方向的错误。
    无产阶级革命派和广大群众要经常想到，人民解放军是无产阶级专政的最重要的工具，是无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。我们之所以能够发动这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，正是因为有忠于毛主席、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的人民解放军作坚强的后盾。
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明，没有人民解放军，就不可能进行无产阶级文化大革命；没有人民解放军的全力支援，无产阶级文化大革命就不能取得象今天这样的辉煌成就。
    正因为这样，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，最信赖解放军，最热爱解放军，和解放军密切合作。他们把对解放军的态度，看成是对无产阶级专政的态度，是对无产阶级文化大革命的态度。
    人民群众最信任解放军、依靠解放军，解放军也最信任人民群众、依靠人民群众。无论是过去，还是现在，解放军总是把信任和依靠人民群众，看作是最根本的原则，放在最重要的地位。
    毛主席指出：“……只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”
    十七年前，人民解放军在毛主席的英明领导下，依靠人民群众，解放了全中国。今天，人民解放军要完成保卫社会主义祖国，巩固无产阶级专政的伟大任务，同样，要发扬同人民群众紧密结合的光荣传统，实现“军民一致”的原则。
    牢固地树立对人民群众的正确态度，是胜利完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训任务的关键。
    解放军的干部战士，必须认识到自己是人民的儿子，是群众的学生，坚决相信群众，依靠群众。办任何事情，都首先和群众商量，进行调查研究，在群众面前弄清楚，在群众中充分讨论。只要真诚地向群众学习，虚心地听群众意见，就能够正确地识别左派，坚定地支持左派。
    解放军的干部战士，必须坚决捍卫无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，把人民解放军的“三大民主”的优良传统，带到广大革命群众中来。要帮助群众充分运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，摆事实，讲道理，坚持文斗，反对武斗，通过正常的辩论，肯定正确，改正错误，分清大是大非，在毛泽东思想的基础上统一起来。
    人民和军队，军队和人民，要永远肩并肩，心连心，坚决执行中央军委一月二十八日的八条命令和四月六日的十条命令。八条命令，主要方面是讲群众应当怎样正确地对待人民解放军，人民要拥护子弟兵。十条命令，主要方面是讲人民解放军应当怎样正确地对待群众，人民军队要爱人民。八条命令和十条命令的精神，是一致的。把十条命令和八条命令对立起来，是不对的，绝不要利用十条命令去破坏八条命令。如果用十条命令去破坏八条命令，那就错了。人民群众对军队有什么批评和建议，可以善意地用适当的方式提出来，绝不能把斗争的矛头指向人民解放军。
    军民团结如一人，试看天下谁能敌？无产阶级文化大革命，是一次大战役。我们依靠广大的革命群众，依靠强大的人民解放军，依靠大多数的革命干部，难道还有什么困难，什么障碍，能够阻挡我们继续胜利前进吗？我们将赢得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，这是肯定了的，毫无疑义的。
