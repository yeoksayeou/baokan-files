The broad working class in the capitalist world is actively engaged in the struggle against American imperialism, monopoly capital, and the reactionary forces of various countries. This shows that the thoroughly capitulationist and traitorous policy of the Soviet revisionist leading clique in the international workers' movement, which completely capitulates to American imperialism and thoroughly betrays the interests of the working class, is increasingly bankrupt.

The Soviet revisionist leading clique attempts to make the international workers' movement serve American imperialism's policy of aggression and war. They collaborate with American imperialism's "peace talks" conspiracy on the Vietnam issue, vigorously advocating for a "ceasefire" and "peaceful resolution" of the Vietnam problem in the international workers' movement. They also use the advocacy of "relaxation" of the European situation to help American imperialism achieve a military shift eastward and increase troops in South Vietnam.

In the international workers' movement, the Soviet revisionist leading clique emphasizes purely trade union struggles, making immediate economic interests everything, opposing the highlighting of politics in workers' struggles, and not allowing the working class to rise up against imperialism, monopoly capital, and the reactionary forces of their own countries.

Regarding the workers' struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, they do not speak of supporting the struggles of workers in various countries seeking independence. For countries that have already gained independence, they only talk about developing the national economy and do not talk about opposing imperialist aggression and infiltration, attempting to fundamentally cancel out the anti-imperialist struggles of the working class in the Asia-Africa-Latin America region.

Regarding the workers' struggles in capitalist countries, they emphasize economic and social demands, advocating the fallacy of so-called nationalization to limit monopoly capital, attempting to deny the correct path of the working class struggling for its own liberation.

The Soviet revisionist leading clique also engages in extensive splitist activities in the international workers' movement and fiercely opposes China. At the 16th Council of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Soviet revisionist leading clique wielded the baton, illegally depriving the Chinese trade union delegation of the right to attend the meeting. At the same time, they advocate for "joint actions" with the reactionary leadership of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, proposing that the World Federation of Trade Unions send a delegation to negotiate "joint actions" on the Vietnam issue with the American monopoly capital's puppet organization, AFL-CIO.

The Soviet revisionist leading clique's treacherous behavior is increasingly thoroughly exposed before the working class of the whole world. No matter how they collude with American imperialism and attempt to sabotage the international workers' movement, they will ultimately be thrown into the garbage heap of history by the international working class and the people of the whole world.

    各国工人看穿苏修叛徒面目
    资本主义世界广大工人阶级积极投入反对美帝国主义反对垄断资本和各国反动派的斗争，说明苏修领导集团在国际工人运动中推行的彻底投降美帝国主义、彻底出卖工人阶级利益的反革命政策正在日益破产。
    苏修领导集团妄图使国际工人运动为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，配合美帝国主义在越南问题上的“和谈”阴谋，竭力在国际工人运动中鼓吹越南“停火”、“和平解决”越南问题。他们还用鼓吹“缓和”欧洲局势，来使美帝国主义实现军事力量东移，增兵南越。
    苏修领导集团在国际工人运动中强调纯粹的工会斗争，把谋求眼前经济利益当作一切，反对在工人斗争中突出政治，不许工人阶级起来造帝国主义、垄断资本和本国反动派的反。
    他们在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲工人斗争的问题上，不讲支持正在争取独立的各国工人的斗争，对于已经取得独立的国家的工人斗争，只讲发展民族经济，不讲反对帝国主义的侵略和渗透，妄图从根本上取消亚非拉地区工人阶级的反帝斗争。
    他们在资本主义国家工人斗争的问题上，一味强调经济和社会要求，宣扬以所谓国有化来限制垄断资本的谬论，妄图否定工人阶级争取自身解放的正确道路。
    苏修领导集团还在国际工人运动中大搞分裂活动，疯狂反华。在世界工联第十六次理事会上，苏修领导集团挥舞指挥棒，竟然非法剥夺中国工会代表团出席会议的权利。同时，他们还鼓吹同反动的国际自由工联领导集团搞“联合行动”，主张世界工联派代表团，去同美国垄断资本的御用工具产联—劳联商谈在越南问题上的“联合行动”。
    苏修领导集团这种叛卖行为，在全世界工人阶级面前越来越彻底地暴露了他们的工贼面目。不管他们怎样同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，力图破坏国际工人运动，他们终究要被国际工人阶级和全世界人民抛进历史的垃圾堆。
