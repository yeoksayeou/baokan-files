Hanoi military and civilians shoot down nine American aggressor aircraft

New China News Agency, Hanoi, May 19 - In its war of aggression against Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has carried out a serious new "escalation": this morning and afternoon, it brazenly dispatched multiple batches of aircraft to madly bomb the central and suburban residential areas of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi. The heroic military and civilians of Hanoi, who were fully prepared, resolutely punished the American air pirates, shooting down nine American aggressor aircraft, damaging several, and killing and capturing multiple American air pirates.

At around 10 a.m., after just a few minutes of battle, the military and civilians of Hanoi shot down six American aggressor aircraft and captured a batch of American air pirates.

At 2:30 p.m., when the American aggressor aircraft once again invaded Hanoi's airspace, the highly vigilant military and civilians of Hanoi struck down three American aggressor aircraft with their first volley of artillery fire. The American air pirates who parachuted down were immediately captured.

Today, the people of Hanoi personally witnessed the pitiful sight of American aggressor aircraft being hit and catching fire. They joyously discussed the news of shooting down multiple invading American aircraft. They all expressed their determination to give the American aggressors, who are escalating the war, even heavier blows.
