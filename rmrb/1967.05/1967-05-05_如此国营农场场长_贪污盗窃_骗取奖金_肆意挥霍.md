According to a report from the Soviet Union's *Socialist Kazakhstan* newspaper, Babayev, the director of the Jambyl Fruit State Farm, soon after taking office, issued an order to scrap a new car purchased by the state farm, which had only been used for a year. He then sold it to his brother-in-law for 400 rubles. When allocating public housing, this farm director concealed one house and later sold it to someone else, pocketing the money himself.

This farm director and the farm's party secretary, Turbanov, together occupied two and a half hectares of private plots, hiring workers to labor in their vegetable gardens, with wages paid by the state farm. However, the thousands of rubles earned from selling vegetables went into their own pockets.

In 1964, this state farm falsely reported 125 hectares of beet fields as 80 hectares and calculated all the production as if it were from 80 hectares, resulting in the farm being reported as having the highest yield per unit area. For this, farm director Babayev and his accomplices defrauded thousands of rubles in bonuses from the Jambyl Sugar Factory.

Farm director Babayev also used similar tactics with the dairy cows. The state farm's pasture had 150 dairy cows. But according to the reports, there were "only 100 dairy cows." Where the rest of the cows went is quite clear.

In 1963, this state farm spent 20,000 rubles to dig a large cellar. However, later, when Babayev's friends were watering their own vegetable plots, they flooded the cellar. The farm leadership did not care and simply wrote off the 20,000 rubles, forcing them to dig a new cellar.

    如此国营农场场长
    贪污盗窃　骗取奖金　肆意挥霍
    据苏联《社会主义哈萨克斯坦报》报道，江布尔瓜果国营农场场长巴巴耶夫，来场后不久，就下了一道命令注销国营农场新买的、只乘坐了一年的一辆汽车，随后以四百卢布卖给自己的连襟。在分配公用房屋时，这个农场场长又隐瞒了一所房子，后来把它卖给了别人，钱由他私吞了。
    这个农场场长和农场党组织的书记土番诺夫，两人占了两公顷半自留地，专门雇工在他们的菜园里劳动，工资由国营农场支付，而出售蔬菜的数千卢布却落到他们两人腰包里。
    一九六四年，这个国营农场，将一百二十五公顷糖萝卜地虚报为八十公顷，将所有产量计算为八十公顷地的产量，结果变成了单位产量最高的农场。为此，农场场长巴巴耶夫及其同伙者，从江布尔制糖厂骗取了数千卢布的奖金。
    农场场长巴巴耶夫，对奶牛也使用了他的这套办法。国营农场牧场里有一百五十头奶牛。但据报表来看：“只有奶牛一百头”。其余的牛那里去了，那是很清楚的。
    这个国营农场，在一九六三年花去两万卢布，挖了一个大地窖。但是，到后来由农场场长巴巴耶夫的三朋四友浇自己的菜地时，把地窖淹得不象样。农场领导对此觉得无所谓，随手写了一张报销单，竟把两万卢布报销掉，并且不得不重新挖地窖。
