	Threats, persecution, and obstacles cannot stop the Yugoslavian people from loving Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.

	BEIJING, May 12 (Xinhua) — The laboring people of Yugoslavia, despite threats, persecution, and heavy restrictions imposed by the Tito clique, have expressed their boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in various ways.

	Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has been launched with great fanfare, the Tito clique has intensified and maliciously carried out anti-China propaganda. However, the laboring people of Yugoslavia have only grown more fond of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Many people shout enthusiastically, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" when they see Chinese comrades on the streets, in shops, parks, or other public places. Many workers and students proactively ask Chinese comrades for Chairman Mao's badges. Some people, after receiving one badge, ask for another to give to their relatives. A driver, after receiving a Chairman Mao badge, immediately wore it on his chest. Pointing to the badge, he said with great respect, "Mao Zedong is the great teacher of the revolution."

	A Yugoslavian laborer told a Chinese comrade, "You are truly fortunate to have the great Mao Zedong. He is leading the Chinese people to build genuine socialism. Like Marx and Lenin, Mao Zedong is a great man." Many Yugoslavian youths enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao as "the greatest revolutionary of our time."

	In Yugoslavia, more and more people yearn to obtain Chairman Mao's works, "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," and portraits of Chairman Mao. Chinese comrades encounter such requests wherever they go. Many people, despite the risk of political persecution, call, write letters, or even visit Chinese comrades to request these items. A Yugoslavian citizen wrote in a letter, "I have long wanted to buy a portrait of Mao Zedong, but I have not been successful. Therefore, I request that you send me one, and also request that you send me the wise works and quotations of Chairman Mao."

	A Yugoslavian youth student was very excited and said, "I yearn to study the works and quotations of the great leader, the great communist, Chairman Mao." He continued, "If I can obtain a portrait and works of Chairman Mao, it will be a great encouragement for me. My wish is to study the works of the great communist—Chairman Mao, because Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist."

	The Tito clique's instigation of thugs to smash the display window of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia on January 20th sparked great indignation among the Yugoslavian people. A group of Yugoslavian citizens, in a letter signed "Friends of the Great Chinese People," angrily pointed out that this outrage was orchestrated by the "Fascist lackeys" of the Yugoslavian authorities. The letter shouted, "Long live the great teacher, leader, commander, and helmsman of the Chinese people—Chairman Mao Zedong!"

	Many Yugoslavian friends also expressed their high praise for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. A worker enthusiastically said, "Please convey my heartfelt respect to the Chinese people and Red Guards under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong." An employee said, "I highly appreciate the revolutionary enthusiasm of Chinese revolutionary youth." A young student said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a new event in the Chinese people's progress along the correct path. The Yugoslavian laboring people expressed great dissatisfaction with the Tito clique's media's malicious slander of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They angrily said, "This is lying, deceiving, and has ulterior motives."

    威胁、迫害阻挡不了南斯拉夫人民对毛主席的热爱
    毛主席是最伟大的马列主义者
    新华社讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫劳动人民，不顾铁托叛徒集团的威胁、迫害和重重封锁，通过各种形式，表达他们对当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限敬仰。
    自从中国无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈地展开以来，铁托集团变本加厉地、恶毒地进行反华宣传，但是，南斯拉夫的劳动人民却更加热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想。很多人在街上、在商店、公园或其他公共场所见到中国同志就热情地欢呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”不少工人和学生主动向中国同志要毛主席像章。有的人得到一枚，还再要一枚带给自己的亲人。有一位司机在得到一枚毛主席像章后，马上戴在胸前。他指着毛主席像章无限敬仰地说：“毛泽东是革命的伟大导师。”
    一位南斯拉夫劳动者对中国同志说：“你们真幸福，有伟大的毛泽东。他正在领导中国人民建设真正的社会主义。象马克思、列宁一样，毛泽东是一位伟大人物”。许多南斯拉夫青年热情地赞颂毛主席是“当代最伟大的革命家”。
    在南斯拉夫，越来越多的人渴望得到毛主席著作、《毛主席语录》和毛主席的像片。中国同志无论在什么地方都能遇到这样的要求。不少人冒着遭到政治迫害的危险，给中国同志打电话、写信、甚至登门索取。一位南斯拉夫公民在信中说：“我很久以来就想买一张毛泽东的像片，但是没能如愿，因此，请求你们给我寄一张，并请求你们寄给我毛主席的英明的著作和语录”。
    一位南斯拉夫青年学生十分激动地说：“我渴望了解伟大的领袖、伟大的共产主义者毛主席的著作和语录”，“如能得到毛主席的像片和著作，对我来说，将是极大的鼓舞。我的愿望就是研究伟大的共产主义者——毛主席的著作，因为，毛泽东是最伟大的马克思列宁主义者”。这位青年学生并要求中国同志向敬爱的毛主席转达他的问候。
    铁托集团一月二十日唆使暴徒砸碎中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆的新闻橱窗的暴行，引起了南斯拉夫人民的极大愤慨。一批南斯拉夫公民在署名为“伟大的中国人民的朋友们”的来信中愤怒地指出，这一暴行是南斯拉夫当局指使“法西斯走狗”干的。信中高呼：“中国人民的导师、领袖、统帅和舵手——伟大的毛泽东万岁！”
    许多南斯拉夫朋友还向中国同志表达了他们对毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的高度赞扬。一位工人热情洋溢地说：“请转达我对毛泽东同志领导下的中国人民和红卫兵的十分衷心的敬意。”一位职员说：“我高度评价中国革命青年的革命热情”。一位青年学生说，中国的无产阶级文化大革命是中国人民“沿着正确道路前进中的新事件”。南斯拉夫劳动人民对铁托集团的报刊恶毒污蔑中国无产阶级文化大革命表示非常不满。他们愤慨地说：“这是撒谎、欺骗、是别有用心”。
