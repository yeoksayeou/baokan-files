With the red storm of the "January Revolution," our propaganda team of fifteen, armed with Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," has been following Mao Zedong's instructions to make literature and art a component of the revolutionary machine. We use art as a weapon to unite the people, educate the people, strike at the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line."

In our first performance, we presented the program "The Revolutionary Masses Unite to Seize Power from the Capitalist Roaders," aiming our fire at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and inspiring the revolutionary masses to seize back the power over Party, government, finance, and culture from their hands. After hearing the Party Central Committee's letter to the revolutionary workers and cadres of all factories and enterprises across the country on the radio, we immediately organized a study session and, based on this letter, created and rehearsed nineteen programs overnight, performing them in the factories the very next day.

Over the past three months, all members of the team have created more than a hundred art programs to serve the revolutionary masses in a fighting posture. We have continuously performed six thematic programs, including "Firing the First Shot for Spring Production," "Revolutionary Cadres Stand Up," "Class Struggle and Production," and "Criticize the Poisonous Book 'Cultivation of the Self.'"

Workers said, "You are performing the image of workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We must act like the workers on stage." Poor and lower-middle peasants said, "The whole evening was about what we peasants care about the most. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, seize the revolution, promote production, and fire the first shot for spring production." Revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and the broad revolutionary masses, after watching the performances, all expressed their determination to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, criticize the poisonous book 'Cultivation of the Self' thoroughly in this great criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and achieve great unity among the revolutionaries. Some workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, after watching the performance, even ran to our lodging at night, saying, "You are conveying the voice of the proletarian headquarters, performing programs that the revolutionaries love to watch."

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses are the true iron wall defending the dictatorship of the proletariat. They see most clearly, recognize most distinctly, and fight most fiercely against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the ghosts and monsters. They possess the greatest courage, the greatest daring, the greatest enthusiasm, and the greatest wisdom, creating immortal feats with the great wisdom and courage of the proletariat. We, the entire team, think what the revolutionary masses think, worry about what they worry about, hate what they hate, and love what they love. We pool our strengths and create twelve art programs, such as "Firmly Support the Revolutionary Leftists," "The Revolutionary Leftists Are Made of Steel," "The Hearts of the Revolutionary Leftists Are the Reddest," and "The Eyes of the Red Guards Are the Sharpest," singing the praises of the great deeds of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and inspiring the fighting spirit and confidence in victory of the revolutionary masses. Towards the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, we create twenty-five art programs with the greatest hatred, such as "Rise Up and Smash the Poisonous Book 'Cultivation of the Self' with a Thousand-Pound Hammer," "Exposing 'Cultivation of the Self' Under the Magic Mirror," "Peeling Off the Mask of the 'Old Revolutionary,'" "Two Khrushchevs Are Equally Bad," and "Firmly Pull Down the Chinese Khrushchev from His Horse." Through these programs, we expose the ugly faces of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, point out their inevitable failure, and encourage the revolutionary masses to unite as one and decisively defeat them.

To sing the praises of the revolutionary masses and expose the class enemies is to be politically clear-cut in our likes and dislikes. The entire team says, "We must, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, carry forward the glorious tradition of loving the people in our army and must wholeheartedly take the plays to the people's doorsteps." The entire team, following Chairman Mao's instructions on being extremely responsible to work and extremely enthusiastic towards comrades and the people, actively takes the plays to the people's doorsteps. We can perform in the Nanjing People's Auditorium under bright lights, and we can also perform in the rural threshing grounds under a single kerosene lamp; we can perform on the stage, and we can also perform in the workshops; we can perform on sunny days, and we can also perform on rainy and snowy days without fail. In front of four thousand spectators at the Nanjing Radio Factory, we performed until our clothes were soaked with sweat, and in front of a hundred spectators in the rural fields, we also performed until our clothes were soaked with sweat. Some team members said, "Executing and propagating Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and singing the praises of the proletarian revolutionaries is the best way to love the people. No difficulty is insurmountable."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The life of the people is the only inexhaustible source for all literature and art." "One must go to the people, must go to the masses, must go to the fire of struggle, must go to the unique, broadest, and richest source."

Over the past three months, we have gone to the people and become students of the masses. In the countryside, all team members went to the production teams, studied, criticized, and fought alongside the poor and lower-middle peasants, observing, experiencing, researching, and analyzing the struggles of the revolutionary masses, investigating and understanding the active thoughts in the struggles. Dou Xiaolong, a blind old peasant, listened to our two performances, and we specially invited him to give his opinions. In learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants, we learned about the arrangement of labor for spring production, water conservation, raising draft animals, and taking care of farm tools, and immediately created with the masses art programs such as "How to Handle Spring Production" to "seize the revolution and promote production." In the factories, we also performed where we learned. Representatives from more than twenty factories in the Nanjing Telecommunications Instrument System watched our performance and reflected on issues related to labor discipline and rectification, and we immediately created and performed two art programs, "Strengthen Discipline, Revolution is Invincible" and "Fight and Rectify at the Same Time," overnight. In this way, our art programs have become revolutionary and combat-ready, better meeting the needs of the revolutionary masses.

The members of our team are all soldiers from the company, and the vast majority have never done any creation work, and some have never performed on stage. However, by going deep into the masses and absorbing nourishment from them, we have been continuously enriched, and the entire team not only can perform on stage but also participates in creation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We intellectuals who are engaged in literary and art work must change our thoughts and feelings and undergo a transformation. Without this change and transformation, nothing can be done well, and everything will be out of place."

Although the members of our team are not professional literary and art workers, they are all young intellectuals, and their thoughts and feelings must "change from one class to another." Over the past three months, we have always used the "Talks" as our weapon, studying and rectifying ourselves while learning, using the "Talks" to examine and check our actions and transform our thoughts. We have timely discovered and reformed some programs that do not meet the needs of the revolutionary masses and the needs of the actual struggle, eliminating some influences of old literature and art on us. In this way, we have effectively improved the quality and level of our literary and artistic creation, making our literary and artistic propaganda more revolutionary and combat-ready, better serving the revolutionary masses.

We firmly believe that under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and with the help of the revolutionary masses, we will surely be able to complete this task.

    教育人民　打击敌人
    南京部队某部毛泽东思想文艺宣传队
    随着“一月革命”的红色风暴，我们这支十五人的毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，从成立那一天起，就以毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》为武器，遵照毛主席“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”的教导，运用文艺武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。三个月来，我们先后深入工厂、农村、学校，为广大革命群众演出七十七场，及时传达了无产阶级司令部的声音，鼓舞了无产阶级革命派的斗志。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”
    我们第一次演出，就以《无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺走资本主义道路当权派的权》这个节目，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开火，鼓舞无产阶级革命派从他们手里夺回党、政、财、文大权。当我们从广播里听到党中央给全国厂矿企业的革命职工和革命干部的一封信以后，又连夜组织学习，以这封信为依据，突击创作赶排出十九个节目，并立即下厂演出。
    三个月来，全队同志以战斗的姿态创作了为革命群众服务的文艺节目共一百多个，连续进行了《打响春耕生产第一炮》、《革命干部站出来》、《复课闹革命》、《批臭〈修养〉》等六个专题专场演出。工人同志说：“你们演的是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人形象，我们一定要象舞台上的工人那样做。”贫下中农说：“一晚上尽演的是我们庄稼人最关心的事，我们一定听毛主席的话，抓革命，促生产，打响春耕生产第一炮。”革命学生、革命干部和广大革命群众看了演出，都纷纷表示：要高举革命的批判旗帜，在这场对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，批臭《修养》，实现革命的大联合。有的工人同志和贫下中农看完演出以后，还深夜跑到我们住地来，说：“你们传达的是无产阶级司令部的声音，演出的是革命派爱看的节目。”
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，是捍卫无产阶级专政的真正的铜墙铁壁。他们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和牛鬼蛇神，看得最清，认得最明，斗得最狠。他们有最大的勇敢、最大的魄力、最大的干劲、最大的智慧，以无产阶级的大智大勇，创建了不朽的功勋。我们全队同志想革命群众所想，急革命群众所急，恨革命群众所恨，爱革命群众所爱，群策群力，创作了《坚决支持革命左派》、《革命派是硬骨头》、《革命左派心最红》、《红卫兵的眼最亮》等十二个文艺节目，大唱无产阶级革命派和革命群众的丰功伟绩，鼓舞革命群众的斗争勇气和胜利信心。对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们又以最大的仇恨，创作了《奋起千钧棒砸烂〈修养〉》、《照妖镜下看〈修养〉》、《剥开“老革命”的画皮》、《两个赫鲁晓夫一样坏》、《坚决把中国的赫鲁晓夫拉下马》等二十五个文艺节目。通过这些节目，我们揭露党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的丑恶嘴脸，指出他们必然要失败的下场，鼓励革命群众同心同德，坚决地打倒他们。
    歌颂革命群众，暴露阶级敌人，就是在政治上爱憎分明。全队同志说：“我们要在无产阶级文化大革命中，发挥我军爱民的光荣传统，一定要满腔热情地把戏送上门去。”全队同志遵照毛主席“对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱”的教导，主动送戏上门。我们在南京人民大会堂、灯光通明下能演出，在农村打谷场、一盏汽灯下也能演出；在舞台上能演出，到车间里照样能演出；晴天能演出，下雨天下雪天也照样不误演出。我们在南京无线电厂四千观众面前，演得汗水湿透衣衫，在农村田头百把观众面前，也一样演得衣衫被汗水湿透。有的队员说：“执行和宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，歌颂无产阶级革命派，是最好的爱民行动，再大的困难也能克服。”
    毛主席教导我们：人民生活“是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。”“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去”。
    三个月来，我们到群众中去，做群众的学生。在农村，全队同志分头到生产队去，同贫下中农一起学习，一起批判，一起斗争，观察、体验、研究、分析革命群众的斗争，调查了解斗争中的活思想。贫农窦小龙是一位双目失明的老农，他听了我们两次演出，我们也专门请他提意见。在向贫下中农学习中，我们学习了春耕生产的劳力安排、兴修水利、养好耕牛、爱护农具等办法，就立即和群众一起创作了《春耕生产怎么办》等“抓革命，促生产”的文艺节目。在工厂，我们也是演到那里学到那里。南京电讯仪表系统的二十多个工厂的代表看了我们的演出，向我们反映了劳动纪律和整风方面的问题，我们就立即连夜创作演出了《加强纪律性，革命无不胜》和《一面战斗，一面整风》两个文艺节目。这样，我们的文艺节目就作到了革命化战斗化，更加适合革命群众的要求。
    我们队的同志都是连队的战士，绝大多数同志没有搞过创作，有的还没上台演出过。但是，深入群众，从群众中吸取养料，就使我们不断得到充实，全队不但人人都能上台演出，而且人人都参加了创作。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们知识分子出身的文艺工作者，要使自己的作品为群众所欢迎，就得把自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。没有这个变化，没有这个改造，什么事情都是做不好的，都是格格不入的。”
    我们队的同志虽然不是专业文艺工作者，但都是一些知识青年，思想感情必须“由一个阶级变到另一个阶级”。三个月来，我们始终以《讲话》为武器，边学习边整风，用《讲话》来对照检查我们的行动，改造我们的思想。我们及时地发现和改革了一些不符合革命群众需要、不符合实际斗争需要的节目，清除旧文学、旧艺术对我们的某些影响。这样，就有效地提高了我们文艺创作的质量和演出水平，使文艺宣传更具有革命性、战斗性，更好地为革命群众服务。
    我们坚信：在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在革命群众的帮助下，我们一定能够完成这个任务。
