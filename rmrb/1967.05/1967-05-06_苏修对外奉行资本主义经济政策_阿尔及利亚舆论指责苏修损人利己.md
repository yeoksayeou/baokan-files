According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on May 6, Algerian public opinion has recently criticized Soviet revisionists for vigorously promoting capitalist economic policies and colluding with Western European capitalist countries to harm Algeria's economic interests.

According to reports, Algeria, which is rich in hydrocarbon resources, recently held negotiations with several Western European countries regarding the purchase of Algerian natural gas. It is planned to build two gas pipelines between the important gas extraction center of Hassi R'Mel and the ports of Skikda and Arzew to facilitate the export of natural gas to these countries. However, the Soviet revisionists, in order to seize the natural gas market in Western Europe from Algeria, sent a delegation to Rome to negotiate with the Italian State Hydrocarbon Company to extend the Soviet-Czechoslovakian gas pipeline to Trieste, Italy. This has allowed certain Western European countries to use the natural gas imported from the Soviet Union as a bargaining chip to pressure Algeria.

The Soviet revisionists' actions have sparked strong dissatisfaction among Algerian public opinion. The Algerian economic weekly "Algerian News" recently wrote: "One must ask, do highly developed countries want to use every means to maintain the state of underdevelopment they caused in our countries during the colonial era? Has a new form of colonial pact not emerged?"

One Algerian expressed his dissatisfaction, saying: "The Soviet Union's actions in foreign trade show that it is pursuing a capitalist policy."

Another Algerian said: "The Soviet Union, in its relations with other countries, has shown great-power nationalism and self-interest."

    苏修对外奉行资本主义经济政策
    阿尔及利亚舆论指责苏修损人利己
    据新华社五日讯　阿尔及尔消息：阿尔及利亚舆论最近指责苏联修正主义者大力推行资本主义经济政策，同西欧资本主义国家相勾结损害阿尔及利亚的经济利益。
    据报道，拥有丰富碳化氢资源的阿尔及利亚，不久前曾同几个西欧国家就购买阿尔及利亚煤气的问题举行了谈判，并计划在重要的煤气开采中心哈西尔迈勒与斯基克达港和阿尔泽港之间修建两条输气管，以便向这些国家输出煤气。但是，苏联修正主义者为了要从阿尔及利亚手中夺取西欧煤气市场，曾派代表团去罗马，同意大利国家碳化氢公司谈判把苏联—捷克斯洛伐克输气管延长到意大利的里雅斯特。这样就使得某些西欧国家把从苏联输入的煤气当作一张王牌，来向阿尔及利亚施加压力。
    苏修的这一做法，引起了阿尔及利亚舆论的强烈不满。阿尔及利亚经济周刊《阿尔及利亚新闻》最近写道：“人们要问，高度发达的国家是不是想使用一切手段来保持它们在殖民地时代在我们这些国家中造成的那种不发达状态？现在不是出现了一种新形式的殖民公约吗？”
    一位阿尔及利亚人不满地说：“苏联在对外贸易方面的所作所为，表明它奉行的是资本主义政策。”
    另一位阿尔及利亚人说：“苏联在同其它国家的关系中，表现出了大国民族利己主义。”
