    Chairman Mao said: "American imperialism is rampant everywhere, placing itself in a position of hostility against all the peoples of the world, making itself increasingly isolated."

    The Anger of the Arab People Against the U.S.

    The aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, against Syria have aroused strong resistance from the Arab people. The military and civilians of Syria have already entered a state of war readiness. The Egyptian army has rushed to the front lines, standing by in full force. Egypt has demanded that the "United Nations Emergency Force" withdraw from Egyptian territory and the Gaza Strip, and has declared the closure of the Gulf of Aqaba. The Palestine Liberation Army has moved to the front lines, preparing to give the aggressors a crushing blow. The governments and peoples of other Arab countries have also expressed their support for Syria's anti-aggression struggle in recent days. The peoples of the Arab countries are uniting to fight the enemy, preparing to resolutely counter the aggressive actions of U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

    The seven hundred million Chinese people, as anti-imperialist comrades of the peoples of the Arab countries, stand firmly on the side of Syria, Egypt, and the peoples of the Arab countries, fully supporting their just struggle against the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism and Israel.

    U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Arab people. The current tense situation in the Arab region is entirely created by U.S. imperialism. In recent periods, U.S. imperialism has been constantly engaged in espionage and subversive activities in Syria, Yemen, and other Arab countries. With the support of U.S. imperialism, the Israeli government has openly deployed troops along the Syrian border, brazenly preparing for a large-scale armed invasion of Syria, and arrogantly boasting that it will "use force against Syria" and "crush the Syrian government." The U.S. Sixth Fleet is also stirring.

    U.S. imperialism is so blatantly threatening the Arab countries with military force and intensifying its aggressive activities, obviously aiming to suppress the growing anti-U.S. struggle of the Arab peoples, strengthen the reactionary regime of Israel, and further expand U.S. neo-colonialist influence in the Middle East and Africa.

    However, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The tense situations created by the United States have gone in the opposite direction of what the Americans wished. They have served to mobilize the peoples of the world to rise up against the U.S. aggressors." U.S. imperialism has completely misjudged the current situation in the Arab region. The aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel has, in fact, awakened the Arab peoples even more. They are increasingly recognizing the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism. Instead of bowing down to the military threats of U.S. imperialism and Israel, they have launched an increasingly powerful anti-U.S. struggle, resolutely defending their national independence and sovereignty. Now, the peoples of the Arab countries are united in their hatred of the enemy, ready at any moment to give a crushing blow to any invader. This is the Arab peoples' most powerful response to the U.S. imperialists and Israeli aggressors.

    The Arab peoples' resolute struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel, is also a heavy blow to the revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union. It has been proven that the contradiction between U.S. imperialism's tool, Israel, and the Arab peoples is a fundamental contradiction of oppression and anti-oppression, aggression and anti-aggression. The Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt to use the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to restrain the struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples against Israel is actually serving the aggressive plots of U.S. imperialism against the Arab countries, and is hostile to the national liberation cause of the Arab countries. The Arab peoples will certainly see through and resolutely oppose the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership.

    It is worth noting that U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership are tightening their collusion, openly interfering in the situation in the Arab world. According to Western news agencies, U.S. President Johnson has secretly written to Kosygin, asking the Soviet revisionist leadership to "use its influence" to prevent "hostile actions" in the Middle East. At Johnson's behest, the Soviet government has issued a statement, avoiding mention of U.S. imperialism's aggressive plots, but instead shouting about "doing everything possible to prevent the disruption of peace and security in the Middle East." Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Brown has rushed to Moscow to discuss the Middle East situation with the Soviet revisionist leaders. UN Secretary-General U Thant is also actively working, desperately serving U.S. imperialism. These facts show that U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership are using the interests of the Arab peoples as a bargaining chip, trying to extinguish the anti-U.S. anger of the Arab peoples.

    However, the Arab peoples will not stop their just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its aggressive tool, Israel. Their struggle has the support of the revolutionary peoples of the world. If U.S. imperialism dares to allow Israel to launch an armed invasion of Syria or other Arab countries, they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat under the crushing blow of the Arab peoples.

    毛主席说：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”
    阿拉伯人民的反美怒火
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列对叙利亚的颠覆和侵略阴谋，激起了阿拉伯人民的强烈反抗。叙利亚全国军民已经进入战备动员状态。阿联军队纷纷开赴前线，严阵以待。阿联已要求“联合国紧急部队”从阿联领土和加沙地带撤出，并宣布封闭亚喀巴湾。巴勒斯坦民族解放军进入前沿阵地，准备给侵略者以迎头痛击。其他阿拉伯国家的政府和人民连日来也纷纷表示支持叙利亚的反侵略斗争。阿拉伯各国人民正在团结起来，共同对敌，准备坚决反击美帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略行动。
    七亿中国人民作为阿拉伯各国人民的反帝战友，坚决站在叙利亚、阿联和阿拉伯各国人民的一边，全力支持他们反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略阴谋的正义斗争。
    美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人。目前阿拉伯地区的这种紧张局势，完全是美帝国主义一手制造的。最近一个时期，美帝国主义不断在叙利亚、也门和其他阿拉伯国家大搞间谍颠覆活动。在美帝国主义的支持下，以色列政府公然陈兵以叙边境，肆无忌惮地准备对叙利亚发动大规模武装侵略，并且猖狂叫嚣“要对叙利亚使用武力”，“打垮叙利亚政府”。美国第六舰队也在蠢蠢欲动。
    美帝国主义这样明目张胆地对阿拉伯国家施加武力威胁和加紧侵略活动，其目的显然是要镇压阿拉伯各国人民不断高涨的反美斗争，加强以色列的反动政权，并在西亚非洲地区加紧扩张美国的新殖民主义势力。
    但是，正如毛主席指出：“美国制造的这些紧张局势走向了美国人愿望的反面，它起了动员全世界人民起来反对美国侵略者的作用。”美帝国主义完全错误地估计了今天阿拉伯地区的形势。美帝国主义和以色列的侵略，恰恰促使了阿拉伯各国人民更加觉醒起来。他们越来越认清了美帝国主义的侵略面目。他们不但没有向美帝国主义和以色列的武力威胁低头屈服，反而掀起了越来越强大的反美斗争，坚决维护自己的民族独立和主权。现在，阿拉伯各国人民同仇敌忾，随时准备给敢于来犯的侵略者以迎头痛击。这就是阿拉伯人民对于美帝国主义和以色列侵略者的最有力的回答。
    阿拉伯人民坚决反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列的斗争，同样也是对苏修领导集团的一个沉重打击。事实证明，美帝国主义工具以色列同阿拉伯人民的矛盾，是压迫和反压迫，侵略和反侵略的矛盾，是根本不可调和的矛盾。苏修领导集团妄图用所谓“塔什干精神”来束缚巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民反对以色列的斗争，实际上就是为美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的阴谋效劳，就是与阿拉伯国家的民族解放事业为敌。阿拉伯人民是一定会识破并坚决反对苏修领导集团的这种叛卖行为的。
    值得注意的是，美英帝国主义和苏修领导集团正在加紧勾结，公开干预阿拉伯的局势。据西方通讯社报道，美国总统约翰逊已经秘密致函柯西金，要求苏修领导“运用它的影响”来防止中近东的“敌对行动”。在约翰逊的授意之下，苏联政府已发表声明，避而不谈美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，却叫嚷什么要“尽一切可能，不允许破坏近东的和平和安全”。与此同时，英国外交大臣布朗已赶往莫斯科去同苏修领导人会谈中东局势。联合国秘书长吴丹也在加紧活动，竭力为美帝国主义效劳。这些事实表明，美帝国主义和苏修领导集团正在拿阿拉伯人民的利益来作交易，力图扑灭阿拉伯各国人民的这一场反美怒火。
    但是，阿拉伯人民决不会停止他们反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的正义斗争。他们的斗争得到全世界革命人民的支持。美帝国主义如果胆敢纵容以色列对叙利亚或其他阿拉伯国家发动武装侵略，它们就必然要在阿拉伯人民的迎头痛击之下，遭到可耻的失败。
