The Arab people, uniting and persisting in struggle, will win victory. The U.S. imperialists, using Israel to carry out aggression and war threats against Arab countries, are encountering the brave resistance of the Arab people. To counter the aggressors, Arab countries have taken decisive self-defense actions. The entire Arab region has seen a new surge of anti-U.S. sentiment, creating a vibrant and favorable situation.

The struggle between the Arab people and U.S.-led imperialism is a struggle between aggression and anti-aggression, oppression and anti-oppression. For a long time, U.S. imperialism has been rampantly implementing neo-colonialist policies in the Arab region, violating the independence and sovereignty of Arab countries, and plundering the blood and resources of the Arab people. It is the root cause of all the disasters in the Arab region.

U.S. imperialism created Israel, planting a dagger in the heart of the Arab world. Its "United Nations Emergency Force" in the Gaza Strip is actually a police force used to suppress the Arab national liberation movement. It continually engages in armed intervention and sabotage activities against Arab countries. Its Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea is always threatening war against various Arab countries. U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the 100 million Arab people.

The contradiction between the Arab people and U.S. imperialism is a life-and-death struggle that cannot be reconciled. The so-called "Tashkent spirit" is nothing but a deceitful ploy. How can the aggressors and the oppressed, the oppressors and the oppressed, reconcile and coexist? The contradiction between the Arab people and U.S. imperialism is bound to erupt. The Arab people must thoroughly defeat U.S.-led old and new colonialism and will certainly defeat them.

Now, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and running dogs are in a panic. To deal with the Arab people's anti-imperialist justice struggle and stabilize the old and new colonialist positions, they have brought out their best tricks. In fact, there is nothing extraordinary about it; it is just the usual imperialist tactics: one is gunboat diplomacy, using military threats; the other is "great power" deals, applying political pressure.

In a statement on May 23, Johnson openly proposed that the "United Nations Emergency Force" should return to the Gaza Strip, accusing the UAR's blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba as "illegal," and the U.S. ambassador to the UAR even more arrogantly declared that the U.S. would "use force to reopen the Gulf of Aqaba." This is a blatant war threat. The Johnson administration put forward outrageous and unreasonable demands to the UAR; the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain, and France frequently contacted each other, launching a so-called "diplomatic offensive"; the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant rushed east and west, trying to intervene in the Middle East situation. These are all examples of imperialist "power politics," attempting to unite several "great powers" to force Arab countries to surrender.

In the U.S. imperialists' military threats and political pressure against Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist leadership group once again played the role of the chief lackey. The Soviet revisionist group issued a statement on May 23 about the situation in the Near East, not mentioning U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Arab region at all, but instead maliciously shouting about how the peace and security of the Arab region are being "destroyed" and how it is so "unsettling," etc. Then, British Foreign Secretary George Brown hurried to Moscow to meet with Kosygin and Gromyko. According to Brown in Moscow, they discussed "keeping the United Nations in the Middle East" and the issue of "free navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba." Brown proudly said: their discussion was about how to "prevent a big fire." It is clear that Brown and the Soviet revisionist leaders' talks were conducted entirely according to Johnson's tune. The so-called U.S.-Soviet "joint action" is to force the Arab people to surrender to the U.S. and its running dogs. This is another great betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership group against the Arab people's anti-imperialist cause.

In the current Middle East situation, British imperialism is in cahoots with U.S. imperialism. Britain not only practices old colonialism in this region but also new colonialism. It clings to the U.S.'s leg, acting as a henchman, trying to rely on U.S. power to maintain its colonial interests, following the U.S. in shouting to "use force" against Arab countries. Obviously, this aging British imperialism has completely forgotten the lesson of the 1956 Suez Canal incident.

The U.S., Britain, and the Soviet revisionists all seem like formidable forces. They unite to oppose the Arab people, seemingly very "impressive." However, whether it is imperialism or revisionism, they are all decaying forces on the verge of extinction, all paper tigers.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "Big is not to be feared. Isn't U.S. imperialism very big? We have resisted it, and it's nothing. So, some big things in the world are actually not to be feared."

Does U.S. imperialism want to use force? Then, prepare to counter it with force. Does it want to apply pressure? Then, firmly resist it. Does it want to use Soviet revisionists to deceive and use the United Nations to intervene? Then, maintain a clear mind, do not be fooled, and expose its tricks. As long as we dare to engage in such head-on struggle and persist in such head-on struggle, then, whether it is U.S. imperialism, British imperialism, Soviet revisionism, or the U.S.-controlled United Nations, they can only declare failure, bankruptcy, and collapse in the face of the people's power.

Today's world is one where the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The era when imperialism could roam freely with its "strong ships and sharp guns" has long passed. The era when a few "great powers" could sit together, drink a cup of coffee, and impose their deal results on oppressed countries has also passed. Now, the overall world situation is very favorable for the Arab people. The 14 million people of South Vietnam have already fought U.S. imperialism to the point of exhaustion. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-U.S. national salvation war is a great support for the Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle. The Arab people's anti-U.S. struggle is also a powerful support for the anti-imperialist revolutionary cause of the people of all countries in the world. The longer U.S. imperialism's claws reach, the more dispersed its power becomes, and the more favorable it is for the people of the whole world to rise up and attack it.

The 100 million Arab people, uniting and persisting in struggle, will certainly win the final victory in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel!

### 阿拉伯人民团结起来，坚持斗争，去争取胜利

    阿拉伯人民团结起来，坚持斗争，去争取胜利
    美帝国主义利用以色列对阿拉伯国家进行的侵略阴谋和战争威胁，正在遭到阿拉伯人民的英勇抵抗。为了反击侵略者，阿拉伯国家采取了坚决的自卫行动。整个阿拉伯地区兴起了一个新的反美怒潮，出现了一片热气腾腾的大好形势。
    阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的帝国主义之间的斗争，是一场侵略和反抗侵略、压迫和反抗压迫的斗争。长期以来，美帝国主义就在阿拉伯地区猖狂地推行新殖民主义政策，侵犯阿拉伯国家的独立和主权，掠夺阿拉伯国家人民的血汗和资源，它是阿拉伯地区的种种灾祸的总根源。
    美帝国主义制造了一个以色列，在阿拉伯的心脏地区插上一把尖刀。它在加沙地区派驻的“联合国紧急部队”，实际上是一支用来镇压阿拉伯民族解放运动的警察部队。它对阿拉伯国家不断地进行武装干涉和颠覆破坏活动。它的第六舰队在地中海张牙舞爪，经常对阿拉伯各国进行战争威胁。美帝国主义是一亿阿拉伯人民的死敌。
    阿拉伯人民同美帝国主义的矛盾，是你死我活的矛盾，是不能调和的。所谓“塔什干精神”，纯属欺人之谈。侵略者和被侵略者，压迫者和被压迫者，怎么能够和解，怎么能够共处呢？阿拉伯人民同美帝国主义之间的矛盾，是必然要爆发的。阿拉伯人民一定要彻底打败以美国为首的新老殖民主义，也一定能够把它们彻底打败。
    现在，美帝国主义及其帮凶、走卒慌了手脚。为了对付阿拉伯人民的反帝正义斗争，稳住新老殖民主义的阵地，他们拿出了看家的本领。其实，也没有什么了不起，无非就是帝国主义惯于耍弄的那一套：一个是搞炮舰政策，进行武力恫吓；再一个是搞“大国”交易，施加政治压力。
    约翰逊在五月二十三日发表的声明中，公然提出“联合国紧急部队”应该回到加沙地带，指责阿联封锁亚喀巴湾的自卫行动是“非法的”，美国驻阿联大使更狂妄地宣称，美国要“使用武力，使亚喀巴湾开放”。这就是明目张胆地进行战争威胁。约翰逊政府向阿联提出狂妄无理的所谓“五项要求”；美苏英法频繁接触，发动所谓“外交攻势”；联合国秘书长吴丹东奔西跑，力图干预中东局势。这些就是搞帝国主义的“强权政治”，企图把几个“大国”联合起来，迫使阿拉伯国家屈服。
    在美帝国主义对阿拉伯国家进行武力恐吓和政治压力的活动中，苏联修正主义领导集团又一次充当了头号帮凶。苏修集团五月二十三日发表了一个关于近东局势的声明，根本不谈美帝国主义对阿拉伯地区的侵略，而别有用心地大喊什么阿拉伯地区的和平与安全受到“破坏”，多么使人“不安”等等。接着，英国外交大臣布朗就匆匆赶到莫斯科，同柯西金和葛罗米柯会谈。据布朗在莫斯科透露，他们讨论了“让联合国继续留在中东”和“亚喀巴湾自由通航的问题”。布朗得意地说：他们讨论的主题是如何“制止大火的爆发”。可见，布朗和苏修头目的会谈，完全是按照约翰逊所规定的调子进行的。所谓美苏的“联合行动”，就是要迫使阿拉伯人民向美帝及其走狗投降。这是苏修领导集团对阿拉伯人民反帝事业的又一次大出卖、大背叛。
    在目前的中东局势中，英帝国主义同美帝国主义狼狈为奸。英国不仅在这个地区搞老殖民主义，也搞新殖民主义。它死抱住美国的大腿，为虎作伥，企图依靠美国的势力来保持它的殖民利益，跟着美国叫嚷要对阿拉伯国家“使用武力”。显然，这个衰老的英帝国主义已经把一九五六年苏伊士运河事件的教训忘得一干二净了。
    美帝，英帝，苏修，看上去都是庞然大物，它们联合起来反对阿拉伯人民，似乎“神气”得很。然而，帝国主义也好，修正主义也好，统统都是土埋半截的走向灭亡的腐朽势力，统统都是纸老虎。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“大，并不可怕。美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。所以，世界上有些大的东西，其实并不可怕。”
    美帝国主义要动武吗？那就严阵以待，准备跟它动武。它要施加压力吗？那就坚决顶住。它要利用苏修搞欺骗，利用联合国进行干预吗？那就保持清醒的头脑，不上它的当，把它的阴谋诡计予以揭穿。只要敢于进行这样针锋相对的斗争，坚持进行这样针锋相对的斗争，那么，什么美帝，什么英帝，什么苏修，什么美帝御用工具联合国，都只能在人民的力量面前宣告失败，宣告破产，宣告垮台。
    今天的世界，是东风压倒西风的世界。帝国主义靠着它的“坚船利炮”就可以到处横行的时代，早已过去了。几个“大国”的头面人物，坐在一起，喝上一杯咖啡，就可以把它们交易的结果强加给被压迫国家的时代，也早已过去了。现在，整个世界形势，对阿拉伯人民是十分有利的。一千四百万越南南方人民，已经把美帝国主义打得焦头烂额。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，对阿拉伯人民的反美斗争，是一个巨大的支援。阿拉伯人民的反美斗争，又是对世界各国人民反帝革命事业的有力支持。美帝国主义魔爪伸得越长，它的力量就越分散，就越有利于全世界人民群起而攻之。
    一亿阿拉伯人民团结起来，坚持斗争，一定能够取得反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列的斗争的最后胜利！
