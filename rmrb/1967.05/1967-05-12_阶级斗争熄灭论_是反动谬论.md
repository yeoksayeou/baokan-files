The fallacy of the extinction of class struggle is a reactionary fallacy

Li Huicai
Militia Captain of Hongjing Brigade, Shaxi Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province

After reading the article "Patriotism or Treachery?" from the *Red Flag* magazine, I was infuriated to see the words of the number one capitalist roader within the Party. This guy and the landlords and rich peasants are singing the same tune. Whatever the landlords and rich peasants say, he echoes. They say, "After collectivization, everyone works in the same fields, shares the same account book, and divides the grain with the same scale. There's no such thing as class anymore!" He then promotes the fallacy of the extinction of class struggle, advocating for class cooperation and the abolition of class struggle. He and the landlords and rich peasants are in perfect harmony, wearing the same pants.

During the land reform movement, we poor and lower-middle peasants confiscated the landlords' land and property, but we couldn't confiscate their reactionary thoughts. They are like scallions in June—withered leaves, rotten roots, but their hearts are still alive, always plotting a comeback. In our village, there is a landlord element who, after the land reform, pretended to be sick and lay in bed. He seemed like a dead dog, but he watched everything the poor and lower-middle peasants did, remembered it all, and wrote it down. Who got his family's boat, who held the struggle meeting against him, and so on—he recorded it all clearly, continuously for thirteen years. There was also a counter-revolutionary who, during the Cultural Revolution, sharpened a bamboo knife to kill two activists who studied Chairman Mao's works. In the face of these living examples of class struggle, can one say that class struggle has ended?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In our country, although the socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has been basically completed, and the large-scale, stormy class struggles of the revolutionary period have basically ended, the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended."

Obviously, the number one capitalist roader within the Party vigorously promotes the fallacy of the extinction of class struggle, advocating for class cooperation and the abolition of class struggle, all to make us poor and lower-middle peasants forget about class struggle, forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to make us cooperate with the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, handing over the reins of the dictatorship of the proletariat, surrendering our militia's rifles, and letting the ghosts and snakes out of their cages. If we let the landlords and rich peasants ride roughshod over us poor and lower-middle peasants again, we will return to the miserable life of oppression and exploitation, being treated like cattle and horses before liberation. We militiamen must not forget the past. We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp the rifles in our hands, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the class struggle through to the end!

### “阶级斗争熄灭论”是反动谬论

    “阶级斗争熄灭论”是反动谬论
    江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队民兵营长　李惠才
    读了《红旗》杂志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的文章，看到党内头号走资本主义道路当权派说的话，气得我牙齿格格响。这家伙和地主、富农说的话一模一样。地主、富农说什么，他就应什么。地主、富农说：“合作化了，大家在一块田里劳动，一本账上记分，一杆秤上分粮，没有什么阶级不阶级了！”他就鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，主张什么阶级合作，取消阶级斗争。他和地主、富农唱的一个调子，穿的一条裤子。
    土地改革运动中，我们贫下中农没收了地主的土地、浮财，但是没有能够没收他们的反动思想。他们象六月里的葱一样，叶焦根烂心不死，无时不企图复辟。我们村里有个地主分子，土改以后就“生病”，一直躺在床上，看起来象只死狗。可是，贫下中农的一举一动，他都看在眼里，记在心里，写在账上。什么人分了他家的船，什么人开了他的斗争会，等等，他都一笔一笔记得清清楚楚，连续不断地记了十三年。还有一个反革命分子，在文化大革命中，将一把竹砍刀磨得雪亮雪亮，企图杀害两个学习毛主席著作积极分子。在这些活生生的阶级斗争事实面前，难道能说阶级斗争熄灭了吗？
    毛主席教导我们：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成，革命时期的大规模的急风暴雨式的群众阶级斗争已经基本结束，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”
    很明显，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，主张阶级合作，取消阶级斗争，就是要我们贫下中农忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，就是要我们同地、富、反、坏、右合作，交出无产阶级专政的印把子，缴掉我们民兵的枪杆子，让牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。如果让地主、富农重新骑到贫下中农头上，我们就要回到解放前受压迫、受剥削、做牛做马的悲惨生活中去。我们民兵决不能忘记过去，我们一定要坚决听毛主席的话，牢牢掌握手中枪，巩固无产阶级专政，把阶级斗争进行到底！
