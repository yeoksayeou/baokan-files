Today, the capital of our great motherland, the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing—has become a grand stage for workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as Red Guards, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary drums resound through the sky, and victory songs shake the earth. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a grand workers, peasants, and soldiers art festival began today!

"Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for their use." Our great leader Chairman Mao foresaw 25 years ago that a new era in which workers, peasants, and soldiers would take charge of literature and art was bound to come. Today, Chairman Mao's wise foresight is being realized. The revolutionary masses of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, the Beijing Municipal Peasants' Congress, the revolutionary cadres of the revolutionary committees of colleges and universities, the revolutionary students of the revolutionary committees of middle schools, the soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary literary and art workers of the capital's literary and art troupes, all hoisting high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have formed over a hundred Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They have marched to Tiananmen Square, bustling streets, and alleys to perform propaganda shows. With the attitude of masters of the country, they have performed a large number of revolutionary songs, dances, sketches, plays, operas, and recitations that they have created and performed themselves over the past year. They enthusiastically sing the praises of our great leader Chairman Mao, of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, of the great victories of our country's socialist revolution, of the great leaps forward in all fronts of socialist construction, and of the heroic figures among workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the same time, they pour their strongest class hatred into their performances, aiming fiercely at the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road and at the revisionist literary and art line.

It is our great leader Chairman Mao who has led the workers and peasants onto the political stage, and it is our great helmsman Chairman Mao who has guided the workers and peasants to occupy the literary and art stage. The workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards of the capital who are participating in the art festival, with boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao, have sung and danced with the loudest voices and the most joyful steps in today's performances, praising our red sun, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. At every performance site on the streets, the thoughts of the performers and the audience intertwine into one, enthusiastically shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Beijing Garrison, which guards our great leader Chairman Mao, has performed with the greatest political enthusiasm in front of Tiananmen Gate, singing and acting "Serving the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." This team of excellent soldiers, using singing, recitation, dialogue, and sculpture, has vividly portrayed the lofty images of Zhang Zide, Norman Bethune, and the foolish old man, making the broad masses of viewers relive the brilliant "Three Articles" in the artistic realm and receive profound education once again.

The workers of several dozen Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams from the capital's industrial, commercial, and financial sectors have performed rich and varied programs such as the dance "Wishing Chairman Mao a Long Life" and the duet "Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Love Chairman Mao," expressing the boundless love of the revolutionary workers of the capital for Chairman Mao. The workers of the Beijing Glass Factory Revolutionary Headquarters Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team have performed a dialogue "A Great Historical Document," enthusiastically praising the Central Committee's "Notice" personally drafted by Chairman Mao, and praising our great leader Chairman Mao for developing Marxism-Leninism to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

The performance team composed of seven communes in Chaoyang District and the militia Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Daxing County, with the boundless love of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for our great leader Chairman Mao, have performed one after another wonderful programs praising our great leader Chairman Mao and his revolutionary literary and art line. The Daxing County Militia Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of Dongba Commune and Shibaidian Commune in Chaoyang District have performed "The Talks Shine" and "Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the Publication of the Talks," enthusiastically praising our great leader Chairman Mao for pointing out the direction for revolutionary literature and art.

The powerful and clear voices of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the capital's colleges and universities, the passionate dances, and the popular recitations, quick-talk, and multiple-voice performances all express their boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao, praising the great significance of the brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and praising the brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line. The Red Guards of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams of the capital's middle school revolutionary committees, with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, have performed the song and dance "Long Live Mao Zedong," and the broad masses of viewers have spontaneously shouted with the Red Guards, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Party's literary and art work is 'a part of the whole revolutionary cause,' and it 'serves the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party for a certain revolutionary period.'" Today, the thousands of revolutionary literary and art programs performed on the streets fully demonstrate: the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the revolutionary youths, guided by Chairman Mao's literary and art thought, in line with the new situations and new things in each stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, timely sing their praises. The revolutionary youths of the Red Flag Art Troops of the Central Academy of Drama have performed the song and dance "Red Guards' Battle Song," enthusiastically praising the heroic struggle of the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the Red Guards.

In today's performances, each Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has also used art as a weapon to fiercely attack the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the reactionary bourgeois line. The dance "Daring to Pull the Emperor Off His Horse" performed by the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Red Flag Revolutionary Rebel Corps of the Beijing Switch Factory aims directly at China's Khrushchev, and the audience watches with delight. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Pingfang Commune has performed a dance full of revolutionary rebel spirit, showing the iron will and determination of the proletarian revolutionaries to pull down the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

In today's grand-scale performance, the proletarian revolutionaries of the capital's professional literary and art troupes have appeared on the streets with a completely new look. With extremely enthusiastic and unrestrained political passion, they sing and dance, enthusiastically praising our red sun, Chairman Mao, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the brilliant "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." For many years, the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and art circles, under the support of the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have cut down the "cultural troops" of the old Eighth Route Army, pushing literary and art workers into the "ivory tower" and into specialized theaters, making them isolated from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and detached from the fiery struggle of life. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries in the literary and art circles have high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought, thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and art line, and seized the stage of literature and art. They have stood on the revolutionary political stage with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the revolutionary Red Guards, shouting loudly. Today, with boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, they sing and dance on the revolutionary literary and art stage. The revolutionary Peking opera workers of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1 have performed Peking opera performances such as "Since the Earth Quaked with Thunder," "We Should Believe in the Masses, We Should Believe in the Party," and "Because We Serve the People" on Tiananmen Square, receiving enthusiastic applause from the audience. The revolutionary youths of the China Children's Art Theatre have performed the dialogue "Peeling the Skin" on the square. The performers draw and speak, speak and act, exposing the ugly face of the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road in broad daylight. The revolutionary performers of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe have performed the dance drama "The World's People Love Chairman Mao," which, through the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and socialist countries, strongly expresses the boundless admiration and love of the peoples of the world for Chairman Mao.

This grand-scale capital workers, peasants, and soldiers art festival will continue for ten days. They will not only perform on the streets and alleys but will also gradually go deep into factories, suburban villages, and military units, performing in production teams, workshops, and companies.

    热烈欢庆《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    首都工农兵文艺会演在街头开幕
    一百多支毛泽东思想文艺宣传队用最充沛的感情、最响亮的歌声、最欢腾的舞蹈，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想；把最强烈的阶级仇恨化入演唱，对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和文艺黑线猛烈开火。
    据新华社二十一日讯　今天，我们伟大祖国的首都、无产阶级文化大革命的策源地——北京全城，成为工农兵和红卫兵小将宣传毛泽东思想的大舞台。革命的锣鼓震天响，胜利的凯歌动地来。为欢庆我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，声势浩大的首都工农兵文艺会演今天正式开始了！
    “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”我们伟大领袖毛主席早在二十五年前就预见到一个工农兵自己掌握文艺的新时代必然到来。今天，毛主席的英明预见正在实现。北京市工代会、农代会的无产阶级革命派，大专院校红代会、中学红代会的革命小将，中国人民解放军北京卫戍部队的指战员，以及首都文艺团体的革命文艺工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，组成一百多支毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，浩浩荡荡奔赴天安门广场、闹市口、大街、小巷，进行宣传演出。他们以主人翁的战斗姿态，把这一年来自编自演的大批革命歌舞、曲艺、话剧、戏曲、朗诵等节目献演给人民大众。他们热情歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂我国社会主义革命的伟大胜利，歌颂社会主义建设各个战线上的大跃进，歌颂工农兵英雄人物。同时，他们把最强烈的阶级仇恨化入演唱，对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、对准修正主义文艺黑线猛烈开火。
    是伟大的领袖毛主席领导工农兵登上政治舞台，是伟大的舵手毛主席指引工农兵占领了文艺舞台。参加文艺会演的首都的工农兵和红卫兵小将们，怀着对毛主席无限敬爱、无限崇拜的感情，在今天的演出中，以最响亮的歌声、最欢腾的舞蹈，歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想。在每一个街头的演出场地，演员和观众的思想交织成一片，热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    守卫在我们伟大领袖毛主席身边的北京卫戍部队毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，以最大的政治热情，在天安门前演出了表演唱《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》。这支由五好战士组成的文艺轻骑兵，综合运用演唱、朗诵、对白、造型艺术等形式，生动地塑造了张思德、白求恩、老愚公的崇高形象，使广大观众从艺术领域里重温了光辉的“老三篇”，又一次受到了深刻的教育。
    首都工交财贸战线上的革命职工组成的几十支毛泽东思想文艺宣传队，演出了舞蹈《祝毛主席万寿无疆》，对唱《工农兵最爱毛主席》等丰富多采的节目，表达首都革命职工无限热爱毛主席的心情。北京玻璃总厂职工造反总部毛泽东思想宣传队的工人们，自编自演了对口词《伟大的历史文件》，热情歌颂毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想的新阶段。
    朝阳区七个公社和大兴县民兵毛泽东思想宣传队联合组成的演出队，带着广大贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情，演出了一个又一个歌颂伟大领袖毛主席和歌颂毛主席的革命文艺路线的精彩节目。大兴县民兵毛泽东思想宣传队和朝阳区东坝公社、十八里店公社毛泽东思想宣传队演出的《〈讲话〉放光芒》和《庆祝〈讲话〉发表二十五周年》，热情洋溢地歌颂伟大领袖毛主席给革命文艺指明了方向。
    首都大专院校红卫兵毛泽东思想宣传队的雄壮嘹亮的歌声，热情奔放的舞蹈，群众喜见乐闻的朗诵、快板、多口词，都表达了他们对毛主席的无限热爱，无限崇拜，都歌颂了《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这部光芒四射的巨著的伟大意义，歌颂了毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉胜利。首都中学红代会毛泽东思想宣传队的红卫兵小将，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，演出了歌舞《万岁万岁毛泽东》，广大观众情不自禁地和红卫兵小将们一起欢呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    毛主席教导我们：党的文艺工作是“整个革命事业的一部分”，“是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。”今天，在街头演出的数以千计的革命文艺节目，充分显示：工农兵和革命小将以毛主席的文艺思想为指导，配合无产阶级文化大革命各个阶段的新形势和新事物，及时地加以歌颂。中央戏剧学院红旗文艺兵团革命小将演出的歌舞《红卫兵战歌》热情地歌颂了无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋——红卫兵的英勇斗争。
    在今天的演出中，各个毛泽东思想文艺宣传队还用文艺这个武器向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，向资产阶级反动路线猛烈开火。北京开关厂红旗革命造反兵团毛泽东思想宣传队演出的舞蹈《敢把皇帝拉下马》等节目，矛头直指中国的赫鲁晓夫，观众看得拍手称快。平房公社毛泽东思想宣传队演出了充满革命造反精神的舞蹈，显示出无产阶级革命派敢于把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拉下马的钢铁意志和决心。

    这次规模盛大的首都工农兵会演将连续进行十天。他们不仅在大街小巷演出，还将逐步深入到工厂、郊区农村、部队，到生产队、车间和连队演出。
