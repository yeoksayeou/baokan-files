Hong Kong's *Ta Kung Pao* reported today that on the 15th, the British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched agents to brutally beat two of the paper's reporters, leaving them seriously injured. The reporters have lodged the strongest protest with the British authorities over this incident.

The report states that on the afternoon of the 15th, after *Ta Kung Pao* distributed an extra edition featuring a statement from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the San Po Kong district, the local residents cheered and spread the news. Reporters Yang Zuku and Huang Ze from *Ta Kung Pao* went to cover the event. As they walked down the relatively deserted Yuen Ki Street, eight or nine British agents attacked them, beating them to the ground and kicking them repeatedly, leaving the two reporters severely injured. The British agents also seized the reporters' cameras and work bags before fleeing in a pre-arranged taxi.

The report further states that reporters from Xinhua News Agency, *Wen Wei Po*, and *Sing Tao Daily*, who were also covering the news, were outraged by the British authorities' dispatch of agents to assault *Ta Kung Pao* reporters. They assisted the two injured reporters, who were covered in blood and bruises, in immediately going to the Governor's residence to lodge the strongest and most serious protest.

More than ten reporters, each wearing a shiny Chairman Mao badge, loudly read quotations from Chairman Mao. Yang Zuku, on behalf of all the reporters, lodged a strong protest with Dai Linji, demanding: severe punishment for the culprits, an apology to the reporters, compensation for all damages, guarantee of freedom to report the news, and assurance that such incidents will not happen again.

    港英当局毒打《大公报》记者激起公愤
    据新华社香港十六日电　香港《大公报》今天报道，港英当局十五日派出特务毒打该报两名记者，这两名记者身受重伤。记者们就此事向港英当局提出了最强烈的抗议。
    报道说，十五日下午，当《大公报》刊登我国外交部声明的号外传到新蒲岗区后，坊众欢声四起，奔走相告，《大公报》记者杨祖坤和黄泽前往进行采访，当他们走经行人较少的衍庆街时，八、九名港英特务分别向他们袭击，将他们毒打倒地，再以脚踢，使两名记者身负重伤。港英特务在逞凶时，还抢去两人的相机和工作袋，随后即乘上早已准备好的出租汽车逃去。
    报道说，在场采访新闻的新华社、《文汇报》和《新晚报》记者，对于港英当局派遣特务迫害《大公报》记者的血腥事件，个个怒火万丈。他们协助两位满脸血渍、满身伤痕的记者，立即赶到“港督府”提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    十多名记者胸前佩着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，高声朗读毛主席语录。杨祖坤代表全体记者向戴麟趾提出了强烈抗议，并严正要求：严惩凶手，向记者赔礼道歉；赔偿一切损失；保证采访新闻自由；保证不再发生类似事件。
