The revolutionary people of Japan have enthusiastically praised the great world-historical significance of the CPC Central Committee's "Notice."

A great historical document inspires the revolutionary people of the world.

"Self-Cultivation" is a poisonous weed; thoroughly criticizing "Self-Cultivation" is a great contribution to the world communist movement.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th—The CPC Central Committee's "Notice" of May 16, 1966, and the May 8th editorials by the editorial departments of "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily" titled "The Essence of 'Self-Cultivation' is the Betrayal of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" have greatly inspired the revolutionary people of Japan. They pointed out that this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

On the 19th, the renowned Japanese historian and professor at Kyoto University, Inoue Kiyoshi, spoke to a Chinese reporter in Tokyo, highly praising the CPC Central Committee's "Notice" of May 16, 1966, as a great document of world-historical significance.

Inoue Kiyoshi, after discussing the section in this great historical document that states, "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie," spoke with revolutionary fervor: "Only the great leader Chairman Mao could have such brilliant and prescient foresight."

Inoue said, this document is a great document of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Every revolutionary should study and apply this document, which has great world-historical significance.

Inoue said, this great historical document brings boundless courage, confidence, and hope to the revolutionary people of the world. The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought inspires the revolutionary people of the world to overcome all difficulties and march forward to victory. Inoue excitedly said, Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism in theory and practice, raising it to a new stage.

Inoue said, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have grown stronger through the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the struggle to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is an invincible force. It will inspire the revolutionary people of the world to carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism to the end. The most advanced China created by Chairman Mao sets a living example for the oppressed peoples of the world.

Japanese journalist Kamimura Akira told a Chinese reporter, the issuance of the CPC Central Committee's "May 16th Notice" and the editorials by the editorial departments of "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily" are a great inspiration to the revolutionary people of Japan and the world. These two documents will play a significant role in helping them further grasp the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought.

Kamimura pointed out that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the most essential issue of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. After the proletariat seizes political power through armed struggle, it must consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Otherwise, the reactionary classes that have been overthrown will carry out a capitalist restoration, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

Kamimura said, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party, in his book "Self-Cultivation," does not mention the issue of the proletariat seizing political power through armed struggle, nor does he mention the dictatorship of the proletariat. This shows that the author of "Self-Cultivation" has completely betrayed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and thoroughly betrayed the proletarian revolutionary cause. He is a consistent counter-revolutionary revisionist who waves the red flag to oppose the red flag and consistently opposes the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Kamimura said, the essence of the book "Self-Cultivation" is to reject the dictatorship of the proletariat and attempt to restore capitalism in China.

When discussing Peng Zhen's "February Outline," Kamimura pointed out that this "Outline" is a revisionist "Outline" that opposes Mao Zedong Thought and attempts to restore capitalism in China. From this "Outline," one can see how the enemy desperately tries to fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought and restore capitalism during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Kamimura said, if the plots of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party succeed, not only will the achievements of the Chinese revolution be lost, but the process of world revolution will be set back by many years.

Kamimura said, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and some Eastern European countries have already taken the revisionist road, and bourgeois dictatorship has emerged there. These countries must undergo armed revolution again to re-establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Kamimura enthusiastically praised the great Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He said, Chairman Mao is the Marx and Lenin of our time. The great role Chairman Mao plays in the world revolution is immeasurable. Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is a microscope and a telescope. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism.

Japanese friends Shiraki Shiro and Koga Shinzo from the Kansai branch of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association told a Chinese reporter, "Self-Cultivation" is a poisonous weed, a black book that poisons the people, and it must be thoroughly criticized.

Shiraki enthusiastically praised, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries, with the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, have fought against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party. This has great significance for thoroughly uprooting the root of revisionism, preventing the restoration of capitalism in China, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and further strengthening the role of the world revolution's base camp, supporting the struggles of the peoples of various countries.

The manager of the Oriental Bookstore, Yasui Masayuki, told a Chinese reporter, the article "The Essence of 'Self-Cultivation' is the Betrayal of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" hits the nail on the head. This is a great contribution to the world communist movement. Without the thought of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the proletarian revolution cannot achieve victory.

Yasui pointed out that currently, some revisionist elements within the communist parties of capitalist countries have betrayed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, thereby completely and thoroughly betraying the proletarian cause, making these parties degenerate into revisionist parties. The revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party are using this "Self-Cultivation" to bind the members of the Japanese Communist Party. Therefore, thoroughly criticizing "Self-Cultivation" has extremely profound significance for our Japanese revolutionary people's future party-building work.

    日本革命人民热烈赞扬中共中央《通知》具有伟大世界历史意义
    伟大的历史文件鼓舞了世界革命人民
    《修养》是一棵大毒草，彻底批判《修养》是对世界共产主义运动的极大贡献
    据新华社东京十八日电　中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》以及五月八日《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部文章——《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》的发表，大大地鼓舞了日本革命人民。他们指出，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    日本著名的历史学家、京都大学教授井上清，十九日在东京对中国记者发表谈话，高度赞扬中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》是一个伟大的具有世界历史意义的文件。
    井上清在谈到这个伟大的历史文件中的“……混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政”这一段话之后，满怀革命激情地说：“只有伟大的领袖毛主席，才会有这样天才的英明的预见”。
    井上说，这个文件，是伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的文件。每一个革命者都应该活学活用这一具有伟大的世界历史意义的文件。
    井上说，这个伟大的历史文件，给全世界革命人民带来无限的勇气、信心和希望。光辉的毛泽东思想，鼓舞着世界革命人民排除万难，胜利前进。井上兴奋地说，毛主席是当代的列宁。伟大的毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的顶峰。毛泽东主席在理论和实践上都天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，并把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    井上说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，在文化大革命的斗争中、在保卫无产阶级专政的斗争中锻炼成长，这是一支无敌于天下的力量。它将鼓舞着世界革命人民把反帝反修斗争进行到底。毛泽东主席缔造的最先进的中国，为全世界被压迫人民树立了活生生的榜样。
    新闻工作者上村明对中国记者说，中共中央“五·一六”《通知》以及《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部文章的发表，对于日本和全世界革命人民是一个巨大的鼓舞。这两个文件，对他们进一步掌握当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，将发生重大作用。
    上村指出，无产阶级专政，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的最本质的问题。无产阶级在武装夺取政权以后，必须巩固和加强无产阶级专政。否则，被打倒的反动阶级就会实行资本主义复辟，推翻无产阶级专政，建立资产阶级专政。
    上村说，中国共产党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在他的《修养》一书中，根本不提无产阶级武装夺取政权问题，只字不提无产阶级专政，这表明，《修养》的作者彻头彻尾地背叛了马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政学说，完全彻底地背叛了无产阶级革命事业，他是一个一贯打着红旗反红旗，一贯反对伟大的毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子。
    上村说，《修养》一书的要害，说穿了，就是不要无产阶级专政，妄图在中国复辟资本主义。
    上村在谈到彭真的《二月提纲》时指出，这个《提纲》是一个反毛泽东思想的、企图在中国复辟资本主义的修正主义《提纲》。从这个《提纲》里可以看出，敌人是怎样拚死地企图在文化大革命中猖狂地反对毛泽东思想，复辟资本主义。
    上村说，如果让中国共产党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋得逞，就不仅会丧失中国革命的成果，而且将不知把世界革命的进程推迟多少年。
    上村说，苏联、南斯拉夫和东欧一些国家，已经走上了修正主义道路，在那里出现了资产阶级专政。这些国家为了重新建立无产阶级专政，必须再一次进行武装革命。
    上村热情赞扬伟大的毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他说，毛主席是当代的马克思、列宁。毛主席在世界革命中所起的伟大作用是不可估量的。毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是显微镜和望远镜。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。
    日本国际贸易促进协会关西本部的日本朋友白根滋郎和古贺新藏对中国记者发表谈话时指出，《修养》是一棵大毒草，是毒害人民的黑书，必须彻底进行批判。
    白根热情地赞扬说，在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，中国无产阶级革命派以敢于斗争敢于胜利的革命精神，对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派所进行的斗争，对于彻底挖掉修正主义总根子，防止资本主义在中国复辟，巩固无产阶级专政，从而进一步加强世界革命根据地的作用，支援世界各国人民的斗争，都有伟大的意义。
    东方书店经理安井正幸对中国记者说，《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》一文，击中了《修养》的要害。这是对世界共产主义运动的极大的贡献。没有无产阶级专政的思想，无产阶级的革命是无法取得胜利的。
    安井指出，目前，一些资本主义国家的共产党内的修正主义分子背叛了马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政学说，这就完全地彻底地背叛了无产阶级事业，使这些党变质成为修正主义的党。日共修正主义分子，正以这种“修养”来束缚日本共产党党员。因此，彻底地批判《修养》，对我们日本革命人民今后的建党工作，具有极其深远的意义。
