The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army calls for the entire army to study the "Notice"

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Notice" is the first program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All levels of party committees should organize cadres and soldiers to study and discuss it seriously, and in conjunction with the new situation of the current struggle and the experience of the past year's struggle, carry out a thorough criticism of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

New China News Agency, May 19th: The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army's directive on calling for the entire army to study the "Notice"

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Notice" on May 16, 1966, which was publicly issued. This is a great historical document. This "Notice" is the first program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. In this great historical document, in his series of great works and instructions, and in his personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao correctly solved the theoretical and practical issues of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. This is a brilliant development of Marxism-Leninism, a new milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism, marking the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The public issuance of this great historical document, the "Notice," is a major event in our country's political life and a major event in the international communist movement. All levels of party committees should organize cadres and soldiers to study and discuss it seriously. At the same time, in conjunction with the editorial department of "Red Flag" magazine and the editorial department of "People's Daily" writing the two articles "A Great Historical Document" and "The Essence of 'Cultivation' is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," in conjunction with the new situation of the current struggle, and in conjunction with the experience of the past year's struggle, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and further carry out a thorough criticism of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!
