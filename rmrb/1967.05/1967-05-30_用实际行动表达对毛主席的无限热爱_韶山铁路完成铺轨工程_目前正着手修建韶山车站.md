In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the Red Guards initiated the construction of the Shao Shan Railway. With the strong support of revolutionary masses from all over the country, the track-laying project has been completed as planned. Currently, work is underway to build the Shao Shan Station.

On February 11th, both the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily published news about the full-scale construction of the Shao Shan Railway. This joyous news quickly spread to every corner of the motherland. Revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country enthusiastically welcomed the construction of the Shao Shan Railway and expressed their limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao with practical actions.

The revolutionary workers of the large-scale rolling mill at Anshan Steel Works, under the great call of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," successfully developed a new type of heavy rail weighing 43 kilograms per meter. When the workers in the finished product warehouse heard that Chairman Mao's hometown was to lay this new type of heavy rail, they were thrilled. They excitedly declared, "The construction of a railway in Chairman Mao's hometown is a great joy for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. We must select the best quality heavy rails and ensure they are delivered on time!" Despite the shortage of manpower and heavy workload, they remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, made up their minds to overcome all difficulties, and with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," they completed the loading of over 40 carloads of new heavy rails in just three days, sending them out ahead of schedule.

Nearly 200 factories, mines, and enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Sichuan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Hunan provinces and municipalities, after accepting the order, closely coordinated with the railway transportation department to timely deliver the cement, sleepers, switches, signals, and other materials and equipment needed for the construction of the Shao Shan Railway to Shao Shan.

The revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, who were responsible for the track-laying task, insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works on the construction site, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution, promote production." While launching a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, they channelled their revolutionary enthusiasm into production. They successfully developed the "electric overhead track-laying machine," increasing work efficiency by more than onefold, and ensuring the completion of the track-laying task.

    用实际行动表达对毛主席的无限热爱
    韶山铁路完成铺轨工程
    目前正着手修建韶山车站
    新华社长沙二十七日电　在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中由红卫兵小将倡议兴建的韶山铁路，在全国各地无产阶级革命派的大力支援下，已经按原计划完成了铺轨工程，目前正在着手修建韶山车站。
    今年二月十一日，《人民日报》、《解放军报》同时刊登了韶山铁路全面施工的消息。这个喜讯，很快传遍了祖国的每一个角落。全国各地无产阶级革命派和中国人民解放军广大指战员，热烈欢呼韶山铁路的修建，并且以实际行动表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱。
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂的革命工人，在毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，试制成功了每米四十三公斤重的新型重轨。当成品库的工人们听说毛主席家乡要铺设这种新型重轨铁路时，群情振奋。他们激动地表示：“毛主席家乡修铁路，这是中国人民和世界革命人民的大喜事，咱们一定要选质量最好的重轨，保证按时运到！”在人力少任务重的情况下，他们牢记毛主席的教导，下定决心，排除万难，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，在三天内装完了四十多节车皮的新型重轨，提前出库发车。
    北京、上海、天津、河北、辽宁、四川、广西、陕西和湖南等省市的近二百个厂矿企业单位在接受了订货任务之后，也密切配合铁路运输部门，把修建韶山铁路所需要的水泥、枕木、道岔、信号等物资和设备，及时地运到了韶山。
    承担这条铁路铺轨任务的广州铁路局的广大革命职工，在工地上坚持活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展猛烈攻击的同时，把焕发出来的革命干劲用到生产中去。他们试制成功了“电动龙门铺轨机”，提高了工效一倍多，保证了铺轨任务的胜利完成。
