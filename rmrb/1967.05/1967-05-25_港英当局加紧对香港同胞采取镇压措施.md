The British authorities in Hong Kong are intensifying their repressive measures against Hong Kong compatriots.

On the night of the "May 22" massacre, the British authorities brazenly announced that "from now on, anyone who participates in a parade or gathers in a public place without prior permission signed by the Commissioner of Police will be arrested and 'charged'." The British authorities continue to dispatch large numbers of "riot police" to the Central District and other areas, and patrol with police cars to intimidate Hong Kong compatriots. The vicinity of the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong also frequently sees British police cars.

On May 23, the British authorities issued an "emergency order" prohibiting the public from entering the "court." Those who violate this "order" will be subject to "prosecution," with a conviction punishable by a fine of 5,000 Hong Kong dollars and imprisonment for up to two years.

In recent days, the Bank of China, Hong Kong Branch, has been using loudspeakers to broadcast to compatriots on the street. The British authorities, terrified, installed six powerful loudspeakers at the nearby British Information Services to play yellow music to interfere. The Hong Kong Police yesterday afternoon broadcast through the Hong Kong Radio that using loudspeakers for "illegal propaganda" or "incitement broadcasts" are "criminal acts" and will be prosecuted.

The British "Government House" issued a "declaration" yesterday, boasting that it is "determined to continue to maintain order in the city," and claiming that the British government is "pledged to support" the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British "Police Training Officer" Lee Fung-Kei also publicly threatened to continue using force against our compatriots. The British authorities also broadcasted through the radio that "the Chief Under-Secretary of the British Commonwealth Relations Department, Galsworthy, who arrived in Hong Kong on Monday, fully confirmed that the British government supports the actions taken by the Hong Kong authorities."

    港英当局加紧对香港同胞采取镇压措施
    新华社香港二十四日电　港英当局正加紧对香港同胞采取镇压措施。
    在制造“五·二二”大屠杀的当晚，港英当局就悍然宣布“今后如果任何人事先未得警务处长署名的许可，参加巡行或在公众地方集会，将会被拘捕和‘控告’”。港英当局还继续向中环市中心区派出大批“防暴队”，并派出警车不断在其他地区巡逻，向香港同胞进行恐吓。新华社香港分社附近也经常出现港英当局的警车。
    二十三日，港英当局还颁布一项“紧急法令”，禁止群众进入“法院”，违反这一“法令”的将受到“检控”，“罪名成立可处以五千元罚款及监禁两年”。
    几天来，中国银行香港分行使用扩音器向街上的同胞广播，港英当局害怕得要命，派出警军在附近的港英新闻处安装了六个强力扬声器，播放黄色音乐进行干扰。港英警务处昨天下午通过香港广播电台叫嚷，使用扩音器作“非法宣传”或“煽动性的广播”，都是“犯法行为，会受到控告”。
    港英“总督府”昨天发表“宣言”，叫嚣“决心继续维持本港治安”，并且声称英国政府对港英当局的这一“决心”“誓为后盾”。港英“警务教官”李凤祁还公开叫嚣要继续使用武力对付我同胞。港英当局还通过电台叫嚷，“星期一抵港的英国联邦关系部首席次官高尔斯沃西充分证实英国政府支持香港当局所采取的行动”。
