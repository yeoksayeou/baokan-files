The marching order of the new era and the powerful weapon of revolutionaries: the world's revolutionary people celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Speech"

People's Daily Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Europe enthusiastically hail Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding light for the revolution of the people of all countries and the most powerful ideological weapon to defeat the enemy.

	We must implement Chairman Mao's literary line in practice

	A literary enthusiast from Laos has been studying Chairman Mao's "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" carefully for the past two years. He said that after repeatedly studying this brilliant work by Chairman Mao, he understood that literature and art of a certain class serve the politics of that class. A literary worker can only create works that the masses like by immersing themselves in the lives of the people. He said that previously, his understanding of literature was very vague, thinking that literature had little effect on the revolution. However, after reading Chairman Mao's "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," his understanding of literature changed, realizing that the pen is a powerful tool for the revolution. He said, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "An army without culture is a stupid army, and a stupid army cannot defeat the enemy."

	Japanese famous writer Yoshitaka Yoshida recently spoke to a Chinese journalist in Kyoto, saying that Chairman Mao's "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a document of great historical significance and infinite vitality.

	Yoshida said that the theory proposed by Chairman Mao that literature and art must serve proletarian politics and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers is not only for China but also a guideline for action for all literary workers around the world who insist on truth and justice. Japanese literary workers must also act according to Chairman Mao's teachings on literary issues and must seriously learn and implement Chairman Mao's literary line in practice. He said that only through the practice of struggle can one truly understand the truth proposed by Chairman Mao that literature serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Chairman Mao's brilliant work has great guiding significance

	A friend from Cambodia recently wrote an article to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." He said in the article: Through the study of this work, we have come to understand that Chairman Mao teaches literary workers to understand their tasks well, which is to strive for the progress of the broad masses. As for the enemies of the broad masses, they must be ruthlessly exposed for their brutality and cunning tricks. At the same time, the broad masses must be pointed out that the enemy will definitely be defeated, so as to inspire the broad masses and strengthen their resolute will to fight against the enemy.

	Pakistani famous writer Muhammad Safdar Mir recently gave a written interview to a Xinhua News Agency reporter. He emphasized that Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has great guiding significance for revolutionary literary workers in all countries of the world. He said that Chairman Mao's brilliant work is "the great guiding ideology for writers and artists all over the world" and "the greatest instruction for cultural workers who are struggling for the liberation of the people of the world."

	He said that after studying Chairman Mao's "Speech," "I understood that if art and literature are to have any meaning in the people's actual struggle, then it must be revolutionized. For this, writers and artists must change their thoughts and correct their attitudes towards work. Their primary task is to wage a tough struggle against the manifestations of bourgeois ideology in art and literature and replace it with another ideology, that is, the ideology of serving the people's revolutionary struggle."

	Using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries

	Tanzanian cultural figure Ali spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," saying: "This powerful ideological weapon has completely shattered the daydream of American imperialism and its accomplice revisionism to achieve a peaceful evolution in China. China will not fall into the revisionist quagmire like the Soviet Union."

	Ali went on to say: "We Africans, through our personal experience, have increasingly come to understand Chairman Mao's theories on literature. The African people, who are engaged in a tit-for-tat struggle for political and economic independence, are also struggling to defend their national literature. We are always vigilant to defend our national literature and resist the infiltration of decadent literature propagated by American imperialism to re-enslave the African people."

	The deputy secretary-general of the Swaziland Progressive Party, Nkosi, recently issued a statement in Cairo to reporters, saying that Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is "a valuable contribution to all revolutionary movements struggling for the liberation of the oppressed people."

	The statement said: Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the world, and Chairman Mao's "Speech" delivered 25 years ago is still very suitable for the current struggle of the people of various countries. "It is our great guide and sharpest weapon in our struggle. We must use this sharp weapon to annihilate all reactionary forces."

	The National Revolutionary Movement Youth Organization Cultural Committee (National Union of Artists of Congo-Brazzaville) recently issued a statement signed by the committee chairman, Diabua, saying: "We joyfully hail the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's 'Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art.' We joyfully praise this article and wish the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, eternal life."

	The statement pointed out: For us in Congo-Brazzaville who are engaged in cultural and ideological work, this article is the guide to our actions on the cultural front. The statement emphasized: "Chairman Mao's work on literature is indeed a sharp and invincible weapon for the Chinese people and for the people of various Asian and African countries who are struggling against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism, neo-colonialism, and reactionaries."

	"The Speech" greatly enriches Marxism-Leninism

	An English worker from Coventry, Henderson Brooks, said: "Chairman Mao's 'Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' greatly enriches Marxism-Leninism." He said that this work is not only of guiding significance to those who are directly engaged in revolutionary literary creation but also to all revolutionary cadres. He pointed out, "This work shines brightly in the classics of Marxism-Leninism."

	Brooks stressed: "Today, when proletarian revolutionaries all over the world are fighting against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, Chairman Mao's great work is indispensable. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres engaged in literary creation will learn and correctly apply this work, ensuring the thorough defeat of all revisionists."

    新时代的进军号角　革命者的强大武器
    世界革命人民欢呼毛主席的光辉著作《讲话》发表二十五周年
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：亚非欧革命人民在毛主席光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年时，热烈欢呼毛泽东思想是各国人民革命的指路明灯，是战胜敌人的最强大的思想武器。
    必须在实践中执行毛主席的文艺路线
    老挝一位文艺爱好者，两年来经常认真学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。他说，经过反复学习毛主席的这篇光辉著作，使他懂得了一定阶级的文艺是为一定阶级的政治服务的。一个文艺工作者只有深入人民群众的生活，才能写出为人民群众所喜爱的文艺作品。他说，以前，他对文艺的认识很模糊，认为文艺对革命的作用不大。但是，在读了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以后，他对文艺的认识起了变化，认识到笔杆子对革命具有重要的作用。他说，正如毛主席所指出的：“没有文化的军队是愚蠢的军队，而愚蠢的军队是不能战胜敌人的。”
    日本著名作家依田义贤在京都对中国记者发表谈话说，毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是具有无限生命力和伟大历史意义的文献。
    依田说，毛主席指出的文艺必须为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务的理论，不仅是中国的，而且也是全世界的一切坚持真理和正义的文艺工作者的行动指南。日本的文艺工作者，也必须按照毛主席关于文艺问题的教导办事，必须认真地在实践中学习和执行毛主席提出的文艺路线。他说，只有通过斗争的实践，才能真正理解毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的真理。
    毛主席的光辉著作具有伟大指导意义
    柬埔寨一位朋友最近写文章纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。他在文章中说：通过对这篇著作的学习使我们认识到，毛主席教导文艺工作者要很好地了解自己的任务，就是为广大群众谋求进步。而对于广大群众的敌人，就必须要无情地揭露他们的残暴和阴谋诡计。同时，必须向广大群众指出，敌人是一定会被打败的，这样才能鼓舞广大群众，加强他们同敌人作斗争的坚决意志。
    巴基斯坦著名作家穆罕默德·萨夫达尔·米尔最近对新华社记者发表书面谈话。他强调指出，毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》对世界各国革命的文艺工作者具有伟大的指导意义。他说，毛主席的这篇光辉著作“是全世界人民的作家和艺术家的伟大指导思想”，“是对为世界人民争取解放而斗争的文化工作者的最伟大的指示”。
    他说，学习了毛主席的《讲话》以后，“我懂得了，如果艺术和文学要在人民的实际斗争中有什么意义，那么它就必须革命化，为此，作家和艺术家必须改造自己的思想和端正自己对工作的态度。他们的首要任务是对资产阶级思想在艺术和文学中的表现进行艰苦的斗争，并代之以另一种思想，那就是为人民的革命斗争服务的思想。”
    用毛泽东思想作武器战胜帝修反
    坦桑尼亚文化界人士阿里就毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年对新华社记者发表谈话说：“这一强有力的思想武器使美帝国主义及其同谋者修正主义希望在中国实现和平演变的白日梦彻底破灭了。中国决不会象苏联那样陷入修正主义的泥坑。”
    阿里接着说：“我们非洲人通过亲身的经验，已经越来越清楚地理解毛主席关于文艺方面的学说。正在为争取和保卫政治和经济独立而展开针锋相对的斗争的非洲人民，同时也在为保卫民族文艺而斗争。我们始终保持警惕，以保卫我们的民族文艺，反对美帝国主义为了重新奴役我们非洲人民而传播的腐朽的文艺的渗透。”
    斯威士兰进步党副总书记恩科西最近在开罗向记者发表声明说，毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是“对所有正在为被压迫人民解放而斗争的革命运动的宝贵贡献”。
    声明说：毛泽东思想照耀着全世界，毛主席在二十五年前发表的这篇《讲话》仍然很适合当前各国人民斗争的实际情况。“它是我们进行斗争的伟大指南和最锐利的武器，我们必须运用这一锐利的武器来消灭一切反动势力。”
    刚果（布）全国革命运动青年组织文化委员会（刚果（布）文艺工作者全国联合会）最近发表的一项由该委员会主席迪亚布阿签署的声明说：“我们高兴地欢呼毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。我们高兴地歌颂这篇文章，并祝愿中国人民的英明领袖毛主席万寿无疆。”
    声明指出：对于我们刚果（布）从事文化思想工作的人来说，这篇文章是我们在文化战线上的行动的指南。声明强调指出：“毛主席的这篇关于文艺方面的著作，确实是中国人民以及正在为反对以美国为首的帝国主义者、现代修正主义者、新殖民主义者和反动派而斗争的亚非各国人民的锐利的和战无不胜的武器。”
    《讲话》大大丰富了马克思列宁主义
    英国考文垂的一位英国工人亨德森·布鲁克斯说：“毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》大大地丰富了马克思列宁主义。”他说，这篇著作不仅对那些直接从事革命文艺创作的人，而且对一切革命的领导干部都具有指导意义。他指出，“这篇著作在马克思列宁主义的经典著作中闪耀着光芒。”
    布鲁克斯强调说：“今天，当全世界的无产阶级革命者同以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联修正主义领导集团为中心的现代修正主义这两个敌人进行斗争的时候，毛主席的这一伟大著作是不可缺少的。革命群众和从事文艺创作的革命干部学习和正确运用这一著作，将保证彻底击败一切修正主义者。”
