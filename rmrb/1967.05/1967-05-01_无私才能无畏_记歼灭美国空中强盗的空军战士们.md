The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and all things grow with the sun. On April 24, our heroic air force struck down two American imperialist F-4B fighter jets in a single victory. This triumph relied on the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly breaking down selfishness and establishing selflessness, using the spirit of "public" to compose a magnificent victory song.

When the battle began, the cunning enemy made one sharp turn after another, flying up and down erratically and shaking left and right, attempting to escape. The heroes of the air force, led by Song Yimin, had only one resolve in their hearts: to shoot down the enemy planes, to defend Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to safeguard the security of our motherland, and to contribute to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world! They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely decide to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They carried forward the revolutionary spirit of our army, fearing neither hardship nor death, harboring deep hatred for the enemy, overcoming numerous difficulties and obstacles, closely monitoring the enemy planes, and fiercely attacking them until the enemy planes spewed out thick smoke and crashed down.

The unexpected victory in this air battle was the result of the brave and tenacious struggle and close cooperation of the participating troops. No matter who was on duty, they all closely cooperated, forming a strong combat collective, and carried forward the revolutionary heroism and collectivism of our army. Air force warrior Wang Dexiang, at the critical moment of battle, first thought of how to serve his comrades. He eliminated all selfish thoughts, dared to take responsibility, and bravely and accurately worked throughout the battle, until he shot down the American air pirates. This warrior, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has since the day he enlisted vowed to be like Zhang Thide, dedicating his whole being to the motherland. It is with this spirit of selflessness that he contributed to shooting down the enemy planes.

During the battle, the air force warriors, in order to create the most favorable conditions for their comrades, were willing to put themselves in disadvantageous positions. Air force warrior Zhao Guangjiang was just such a person. They cared for and cooperated with each other, and finally annihilated the enemy planes.

In this air battle, there were also many unnamed heroes who made great efforts. They all possessed the sublime quality of being willing to be a "screw" for the completion of the revolutionary cause. The operator of the "eyes in the sky"—radar soldier Li Jincheng—opened his eyes wide as soon as he entered the battle position, closely watching the gray-green fluorescent screen. Suddenly, he spotted two faint bright spots flickering in the lower right corner of the screen. The enemy planes were quickly caught. Soon, the enemy planes, in order to avoid capture, cunningly maneuvered up and down, left and right. Li Jincheng saw through the enemy's trick and closely followed and reported without letting up. The enemy planes hurriedly released interference, attempting to deceive the radar soldiers' eyes. However, Li Jincheng and his comrades followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "Exert all efforts to annihilate the invading enemy," overcoming all difficulties, and providing timely and accurate intelligence on the enemy planes to the battlefield command post. When the American air pirates fell one by one, Li Jincheng and his comrades were overjoyed, feeling happy and proud to have been a good "screw" in this battle.

Selflessness leads to fearlessness, and fearlessness leads to invincibility. Our air force warriors have once again established new merits for the people. This is the result of being nurtured by the "Three Articles," thoroughly breaking down selfishness and establishing selflessness, and carrying out a thorough revolution in the depths of their souls to build a red world of "public" spirit. They will take this victory as a new starting point, further carry out the revolutionization of thought, improve their combat skills, and make new contributions to defending our airspace and safeguarding the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    无私才能无畏
    ——记歼灭美国空中强盗的空军战士们
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。四月二十四日，我英雄的空军部队一举击落美帝国主义F—4B型战斗机两架的胜利，靠的就是光焰无际的毛泽东思想。他们活学活用毛主席著作，彻底破“私”立“公”，用“公”字谱成了一首壮丽的凯歌。
    战斗开始，狡猾的敌人一个大弯接着一个大弯地上下乱窜，左右摇晃，企图逃跑。痛击敌机的宋义民等英雄的空军战士，心中只有一个决心：打下敌机，为保卫毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，为保卫祖国的安全，为世界人民的革命事业作出贡献！他们遵照毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，发扬了我军一不怕苦、二不怕死的革命精神，怀着对敌人的无比仇恨，克服了重重困难和障碍，紧紧地监视住敌机，对准敌机猛打狠打，直打得敌机冒出一股浓烟栽了下来。
    这次对空作战中的出奇制胜，是参战部队指战员英勇顽强，密切协同的结果。不管是在那一个岗位上的指战员，都密切配合，形成了一个坚强的战斗集体，发扬了我军的革命英雄主义和集体主义的精神。空军战士王德华在临战时刻，首先想到的是如何为战友服务，他排除了一切私心杂念，“敢”字当头，大胆负责。尽管敌机耍尽花招，躲躲闪闪，王德华在作战过程中，始终坚定、沉着、勇敢、大胆而又准确地工作着，直到揍下美国空中强盗。这个用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士，从入伍的那一天起就立志要象张思德那样，把自己的整个身心献给祖国。他就是以这种一心为公的精神，为击落敌机作出了贡献。
    在战斗中，空军战士们为了为战友们创造最有利的条件，宁可使自己处于不利的地位。空军战士赵广江就是这样的一个。他们就是这样互相关心，互相配合，终于歼灭了敌机。
    在这次对空作战中，还有许多无名英雄付出了巨大的辛勤劳动。他们都具有为完成革命大业而甘当“螺丝钉”的崇高品质。“空中千里眼”的操纵手——雷达兵李金成，一进入战斗岗位就睁大着眼睛，紧紧注视着灰绿色的荧光屏。突然，他发现两颗微弱的小亮点，在荧光屏的右下方闪动。敌机很快被捉住了。不一会，敌机为了逃避捕捉，狡猾地上下、左右机动飞行。李金成识破了敌机的阴谋，便“紧跟紧报”，毫不放松。敌机慌忙施放干扰，企图欺骗雷达兵的眼睛。但是，李金成和战友们遵循毛主席教导：“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌”，克服了种种困难，向战场指挥所及时而又准确地提供了敌机的情报。当美国空中强盗一架一架地坠落时，李金成和他的战友们欢欣雀跃，都为自己在这次战斗中当好了一个“螺丝钉”而感到幸福和自豪。
    无私才能无畏，无畏才能无敌。我们的空军健儿们又一次为人民建立了新的功勋。这是“老三篇”哺育他们成长的结果，是他们彻底破“私”立“公”，在灵魂深处大闹革命，建立一个红彤彤的“公”字精神世界的结果。他们将把这次胜利当作新的起点，进一步搞好思想革命化，练好作战本领，为保卫祖国领空，保卫史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，作出新的贡献。
