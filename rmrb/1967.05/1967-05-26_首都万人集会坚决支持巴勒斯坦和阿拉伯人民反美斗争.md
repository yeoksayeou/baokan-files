"All the world's peoples, unite! Beat down American aggression and all its running dogs!"

A mass rally of over ten thousand people was held today in the Great Hall of the People to resolutely support the Palestinian and Arab peoples' just struggle against American imperialism and its tool, Israel.

The rally strongly condemned the crimes of American imperialism in using Israel to create a heavy calamity for Palestine and in launching armed aggression and various subversive and disruptive activities against Syria and other Arab countries. It also strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership's evil activities in acting as a henchman for American imperialism.

The rally pointed out that the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the liberation of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. The rally expressed that the Chinese people resolutely support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people and resolutely support the just struggle of the Arab peoples against American imperialism and its tool, Israel.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Guo Moruo, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries Liu Ningyi, leaders of various government departments, the People's Liberation Army, various people's organizations, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and representatives of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses from various sectors attended the rally.

Invited to attend the rally were: Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Office in Beijing, Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad) and his wife, Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to China, Imam, Ambassador of Yemen to China, Hamid, Charge d'Affaires of the Syrian Embassy in China, Farah, First Secretary of the Algerian Embassy in China, Abada, Third Secretary of the Iraqi Embassy in China, Al-Hafidh.

Revolutionary fighters from various countries and other international friends in Beijing also attended the rally. Among them were: Deputy Head of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Writers' Permanent Bureau, Senanayake, Secretary-General of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, Chard, Black American leader Robert F. Williams, Japanese friends Nishizono Koji and Koyama Yuichi, Sudanese friend Kair, Representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand abroad, Paron Chularat, Head of the Malayan National Liberation League's Representative Office in China, Sharifah, Lao friend Kuenying, New Zealand friend Rewi Alley, American friend Lee Du-Bridge, and others.

Today, the magnificent Great Hall of the People was filled with a revolutionary atmosphere. Above the stage hung a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of all the people. Opposite the stage was written: "All the world's peoples, unite! Beat down American aggression and all its running dogs!"

"Revolutionary war is the main form of struggle and the highest form of struggle. The revolutionary task is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." The revolutionary masses from various sectors attending the rally, with their hearts burning with indignation against American imperialism, waved red copies of Chairman Mao's Quotations, repeatedly shouting: "Resolutely support the Palestinian people's struggle against American imperialism and its tool, Israel!" "Resolutely support the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab peoples!" "Smash all the evil activities of the American imperialist tool, Israel!" "Down with American imperialism! Down with Zionism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live the great unity of all the peoples of the world!"

The rally began with the entire audience of ten thousand people standing and singing "The East Is Red," and reciting Chairman Mao's Quotations: "Ending the aggression and oppression of imperialism, mainly American imperialism, is the task of all the peoples of the world." "The oppressed peoples and nations cannot rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle."

Liu Ningyi presided over the rally. In his opening remarks, he strongly condemned American imperialism for instigating Israel to mass troops on the border, threatening war, and seriously endangering the security of Syria and other Arab countries. He also condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership for actively serving American imperialism on the Palestinian issue. He said that the brave Palestinian and Arab peoples would not be intimidated by American imperialism and its tool, Israel. The Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support the just anti-American struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples, and will forever stand with them, fight with them, and win with them.

Guo Moruo then spoke at the rally. He said that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. The Palestinian people, in order to liberate their homeland, have waged an unyielding struggle against American imperialism and its tool, Israel. Through long-term struggle, the Palestinian people have increasingly recognized the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and have put forward the correct slogan that "people's war is the only way to liberate Palestine." Friends of Palestine say that the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the liberation of the Palestinian and Arab peoples.

Guo Moruo severely condemned American imperialism's recent support and encouragement of Israel's preparations for large-scale armed provocations against Syria. He said that Israel has massed large numbers of troops on the border and openly threatened to "use force against Syria." The U.S. Sixth Fleet is also stirring. However, the Syrian people and the Arab peoples with a glorious anti-imperialist tradition will not submit to American imperialism's aggression and threats. They have already mobilized urgently and are ready to give the invading aggressors a crushing blow at any moment. The seven hundred million Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of Syria, the United Arab Republic, and all Arab peoples, resolutely support their struggle against American imperialism and Israel's aggression, and actively support the Palestinian people's just struggle to return to their homeland.

Guo Moruo condemned the Soviet revisionist leadership, the number one henchman of American imperialism, for actively serving American imperialism's policy of aggression and war in the Arab region. He said that at present, when the Arab peoples are rising up to resist American imperialism and its tool, Israel's aggression and provocation, the Soviet revisionist leadership is once again colluding with American and British imperialism, attempting to act as a fire brigade to extinguish the flames of the Arab peoples' anti-imperialist revolution. It is trying to persuade Arab countries to adopt a "cautious" and "restrained" attitude towards American and Israeli aggression. This is another open betrayal of the Arab national liberation cause.

Guo Moruo said that our great teacher Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "If the American monopolistic capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably one day be executed by all the peoples of the world. Other American henchmen will meet the same fate." American imperialism has committed heinous crimes in the Arab region, and Soviet revisionism is steadfastly serving as its henchman. They will surely be severely punished by the Arab peoples.

Guo Moruo condemned American imperialism's crazy escalation of the war in Vietnam. He said that the Chinese people are closely watching the developments in Vietnam. No matter how high American imperialism escalates the war, no matter how far it spreads the flames of war, the Chinese people are determined to support the Vietnamese people's just struggle to the end.

Guo Moruo condemned British imperialism for acting as a henchman of American imperialism in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and for the British authorities in Hong Kong colluding with the Americans and the Kuomintang to carry out fascist suppression of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. He said that we once again give the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong the most serious warning: you must immediately and unconditionally implement the five demands put forward by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and immediately stop the suppression of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. If you insist on going your own way and want to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end, then you will surely be beaten black and blue.

Guo Moruo said that the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao is shaking the world. It inspires our people to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations. It also inspires the peoples of various countries to rise up and make revolution, to overthrow imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Revolutionary peoples of all countries love, worship, and believe in Chairman Mao without limit. They regard Mao Zedong Thought as the sole guide to leading their struggles to victory. A Palestinian liberation fighter said: "Chairman Mao and the Chinese people occupy the largest position in our hearts, and this is unchangeable and unshakable." Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people and is grasped by the broad revolutionary masses of the world. A new world of red brilliance illuminated by Mao Zedong Thought will surely be born in the struggle.

Guo Moruo said that the Chinese people will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, unite with the Palestinian and Arab peoples, and unite with all revolutionary peoples of the world. We will not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, defeat American aggressors and all their running dogs, and eliminate all devils from the earth.

Khalil al-Wazir, Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Office in Beijing, spoke at the rally, enumerating the crimes committed by international imperialism, world Zionism, and international reactionaries under the instigation of American and British imperialism against the Palestinian Arab people. He said that the nature of colonialism, Zionism, and reactionaries is unchangeable; the only way to eliminate them is to adopt revolutionary armed violence and rely on the Arab and Palestinian masses to carry the people's liberation war to the end to smash the imperialist forces and their tool, Israel.

Khalil al-Wazir said that now, more than ever, the Palestinian Arab people and all Arab peoples believe that self-reliance is the basis of struggle; the only means to liberate the homeland is people's war of liberation.

Khalil al-Wazir pointed out that American imperialism is the main stronghold of international reactionaries and the number one enemy of the peoples of all countries. It is American imperialism that created Israel as its base for aggression against the national liberation movement. Since its establishment, Israel has been an expansionist, fascist, colonialist tool of aggression.

Khalil al-Wazir said that the Palestinian people regard the government of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China, and the Chinese people as loyal friends in their struggle to liberate their homeland. The Palestine Liberation Organization also pays tribute to the great proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

He said that the Palestine Liberation Organization also condemns the savage crimes committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong against Chinese compatriots who demand their legal rights.

Khalil al-Wazir condemned the Zionist gang, under the instigation of American and British imperialism, preparing to launch large-scale armed aggression against Arab countries. He said that the Arab peoples in various places, to smash Israel and its imperialist masters, have risen up to resist aggression, and the demonstrators demand to carry the people's liberation war to the end. The Palestinian Arab people and the Arab peoples are prepared to wage the "second Vietnam War" in the Middle East to smash the imperialist forces and their running dog, world Zionism, represented by Israel.

Khalil al-Wazir once again expressed his thanks to the Chinese people for their decisive support to the Palestinian people and the Arab peoples at a critical moment. He concluded with the slogans: "Long live the firm friendship between the great Chinese people and the Palestinian Arab people!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong!"

Ambassador of Yemen, Hamid, spoke on behalf of the Arab countries' envoys in China at the rally. He said that the Palestinian issue is an issue for all Arab peoples, an issue for all peoples of all countries who are struggling against American imperialism, colonialism, and reactionaries, especially an issue for the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples who are bravely struggling for liberation, independence, and social advancement. The victory of the Palestinian Arab people's struggle will be a victory for the Arab peoples and all freedom-loving peoples of the world, and a victory for the oppressed peoples struggling against their common enemy.

Hamid said that after the establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization, it affirmed that armed struggle is a decisive measure to liberate Palestine and recover the occupied territories. The struggle of the Palestinian people has thus entered a new stage. People around the world who support the just cause of the Palestinian people increasingly understand, sympathize with, and support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people.

Hamid pointed out that today, all the peoples of the world recognize that Zionism is merely a running dog of imperialism and colonialism. The event of Israel's aggression against Syria is only part of the international imperialists' plan to control the world. The Arab peoples link their struggle with the struggle of the peoples of the world, especially with the struggle of the Vietnamese people who are resisting American imperialist aggression. Because the liberation struggles of the world are a common cause.

Hamid said that the recent events in the Middle East have confirmed the revolutionary initiative of the Arab peoples against colonialism and its running dog, Israel.

He concluded by expressing his thanks to the government, the Communist Party, and the people of the People's Republic of China for supporting the struggle of the Palestinian Arab people and the Arab peoples against imperialism, world Zionism, and international reactionaries.

Liu Sizhang, a representative of the workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards of the capital, spoke at the rally, first expressing revolutionary greetings to the brave fighting Palestinian and Arab peoples. He said that the Palestinian people, from their own experience, have recognized that armed struggle is the only correct path to victory for the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people have already taken up arms to fight for the realization of their national aspirations to return to their homeland and liberate their territory.

Liu Sizhang said that American imperialism is not only the mortal enemy of the Palestinian people but also the common enemy of the Arab peoples. The Palestinian people and the Arab peoples, in their struggle, have increasingly exposed the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists acting as henchmen of American imperialism. Facts have proven that the Soviet revisionist leadership is an enemy of the Arab peoples. Their reactionary actions will not end well.

Liu Sizhang said that today, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the great proletarian cultural revolution that the Chinese people are carrying out is shaking the world. Our victory is a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. He said that the workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will forever be a strong rear guard for the Palestinian and Arab peoples. In the struggle against American imperialism and its henchmen and running dogs, the Chinese people will forever stand with, fight with, and win with the Palestinian and Arab peoples.

At the rally, a representative of the People's Liberation Army read out a telegram supporting the struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples against American imperialism and its tool, Israel. The entire audience shouted slogans:

"Victory to the Palestinian and Arab peoples! Defeat to American imperialism!"

"Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese people and the Palestinian and Arab peoples!"

"Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!"

"Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

"Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The rally ended with the entire audience singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "The Internationale."

    新华社二十五日讯　在我国无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，首都各界人民一万多人今天在人民大会堂隆重集会，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的正义斗争。
    大会强烈谴责美帝国主义利用以色列给巴勒斯坦制造了沉重的灾难，并且对叙利亚等阿拉伯国家进行武装侵略和种种颠覆、破坏活动；强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团充当美帝的帮凶，阴谋扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝革命的熊熊烈火。
    大会指出，光焰无际的毛泽东思想是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民解放的指路明灯。大会表示，中国人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争；坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其工具以色列侵略的正义斗争。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理李先念，人大常委会副委员长、中国和委会主任郭沫若，人大常委会副委员长、中国亚非团结委员会副主任刘宁一，政府各部门、中国人民解放军、各人民团体、北京市革命委员会的负责人，首都工、农、兵、红卫兵和各界革命群众的代表，出席了大会。
    应邀参加大会的，有巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布和夫人，阿联驻中国大使伊马姆，也门驻中国大使哈米德，叙利亚驻中国大使馆临时代办法拉赫，阿尔及利亚驻中国大使馆一等秘书阿巴达，伊拉克驻中国大使馆三等秘书爱尔哈福德。
    在北京的各国反帝革命战士和其他国际友人出席了大会，他们当中有：越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代理团长阮明芳，亚非作家常设局秘书长森纳那亚克，亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，美国黑人领袖罗伯特·威廉，日本朋友西园寺公一、小林雄一，苏丹朋友凯尔，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，老挝朋友贵宁夫人，新西兰朋友艾黎，美国朋友李敦白等。
    今天，雄伟的人民大会堂充满着战斗的革命气氛。主席台正中悬挂着全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅画像，主席台对面写着毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！”
  “革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”参加大会的各界革命群众怀着对美帝国主义的满腔怒火，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，一次又一次地高呼：“坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争！”“坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民的反帝斗争！”“粉碎美帝工具以色列的一切罪恶活动！”“打倒美帝！打倒犹太复国主义！打倒苏修！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”
    大会开始时，全场万人起立，高唱《东方红》，并且齐声朗读毛主席语录：“结束帝国主义主要是美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，是全世界人民的任务。”“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只能通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    刘宁一主持大会，他在开会词中强烈谴责美帝国主义伙同英帝国主义唆使以色列陈兵边境，叫嚣战争，严重威胁叙利亚和其它阿拉伯国家的安全，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团，在巴勒斯坦问题上积极为美帝国主义效劳。他说，英勇的巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民决不是美帝国主义及其工具以色列所能吓倒的。中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的反美正义斗争，永远和他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    郭沫若接着在大会上讲话。他说，美帝国主义是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民最凶恶的敌人。巴勒斯坦人民为了解放自己的家园，同美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列进行了不屈不挠的斗争。在长期的斗争中，巴勒斯坦人民越来越认识到“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，提出了“人民战争是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路”这个正确口号。巴勒斯坦的朋友们说，光焰无际的毛泽东思想是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民解放的指路明灯。
    郭沫若严厉谴责美帝国主义最近支持和纵容以色列准备对叙利亚发动大规模的武装挑衅。他说，以色列在边境集结大批军队，公然叫嚣“要对叙利亚使用武力”。美国第六舰队也蠢蠢欲动。但是，具有反帝光荣传统的叙利亚人民和阿拉伯各国人民决不会屈服于美帝国主义的侵略和威胁，他们已经紧急动员起来，随时准备给予来犯的侵略者以迎头痛击。我们七亿中国人民坚决站在叙利亚、阿联和全体阿拉伯人民的一边，坚决支持他们反对美帝国主义和以色列的侵略，积极支持巴勒斯坦人民重返家园的正义斗争。
    郭沫若谴责美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团在阿拉伯地区，积极为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。他说，目前，正当阿拉伯各国人民奋起抗击美帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略挑衅的时候，苏联修正主义领导集团又同美英帝国主义勾勾搭搭，再图充当扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝革命烈火的消防队员，它妄图劝说阿拉伯国家对美国和以色列的侵略采取“慎重”和“克制”的态度。这是对阿拉伯民族解放事业的又一次公开出卖。
    郭沫若说，我们伟大的导师毛主席早已指出：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”美帝国主义在阿拉伯地区犯下了滔天罪行，苏联修正主义死心塌地充当它的帮凶，它们必将受到阿拉伯人民的严厉惩罚。
    郭沫若谴责美帝国主义对越南正在疯狂地进行战争“升级”。他说，中国人民正密切注视越南局势的发展。不论美帝国主义把战争升到那一级，把战火扩大到什么范围，中国人民都决心把支持越南人民的正义斗争进行到底。
    郭沫若谴责英帝国主义在中东和东南亚都充当美帝国主义的帮凶，谴责香港英国当局勾结美帝、蒋帮，对我香港爱国同胞进行了疯狂的法西斯镇压。他说，我们再一次最严重警告英国政府和香港英国当局，你们必须立即无条件实现我国外交部提出的五项要求，立即停止对香港中国同胞的镇压。如果你们一意孤行，硬要同中国人民为敌到底，那么，你们就一定会碰得头破血流。
    郭沫若说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命震撼世界，它鼓舞着我国人民更加高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更加有力地支援一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争，也鼓舞着各国人民自己起来闹革命，大造帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的反。各国革命人民无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰毛主席，把毛泽东思想看作是引导他们的斗争走向胜利的唯一指南。一位巴勒斯坦解放战士这样说：“毛主席和中国人民在我们心目中占有最大的位置，这是永远不可改变，不可动摇的。”毛泽东思想日益深入人心，为世界广大革命群众所掌握。一个毛泽东思想光辉普照的红彤彤的新世界必将在斗争中诞生。
    郭沫若说，中国人民决心遵照毛主席的教导，同巴勒斯坦人民及阿拉伯人民联合起来，同全世界一切革命人民联合起来，不怕牺牲，排除万难，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗，把一切魔鬼从地球上通通消灭。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织驻北京办事处主任加尔布在讲话中历数国际帝国主义、世界犹太复国主义、国际反动派在美英帝国主义的唆使下，对巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民犯下的滔天罪行。他说，殖民主义、犹太复国主义和反动派的凶恶本性是改变不了的；消灭他们的唯一途径只能是采取革命的武装暴力手段，依靠阿拉伯和巴勒斯坦群众把粉碎帝国主义势力及其工具以色列的人民解放战争进行到底。
    加尔布说，现在，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和全体阿拉伯人民比过去任何时候都更加相信，自力更生是斗争的基础；解放祖国的唯一手段是人民解放战争。
    加尔布指出，美帝国主义是国际反动派的主要堡垒，是各国人民的头号敌人，正是它制造了以色列，作为其反对民族解放运动的侵略基地。以色列自建立起，它就是一个扩张主义的、法西斯的、殖民主义的侵略工具。
    加尔布说，巴勒斯坦人民认为人民中国的政府、中国共产党和人民是巴勒斯坦人民在解放祖国的斗争中的忠实的朋友。巴勒斯坦解放组织还要向由伟大统帅毛泽东主席发动和领导的文化大革命致敬。
    他说，巴勒斯坦解放组织还要谴责香港英国当局对要求合法权利的中国同胞所犯下的野蛮罪行。
    加尔布谴责犹太复国主义匪帮在美英帝国主义唆使下，也准备向阿拉伯国家发动大规模的武装侵略。他说，各地的阿拉伯人民为粉碎以色列及其主子帝国主义者，奋起反对侵略，示威的群众要求把人民解放战争进行到底。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民准备在中东地区把“第二场越南战争”进行到底，粉碎帝国主义在这个地区的势力及其走狗世界犹太复国主义的代表以色列。
    加尔布再一次表示感谢中国人民在关键时刻给予巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民的决定性的支持。他最后高呼：“伟大的中国人民和巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民之间的牢固友谊万岁！”“伟大的革命领袖毛泽东主席万岁！”
    也门大使哈米德代表阿拉伯国家驻中国使节在大会上讲话。他说，巴勒斯坦问题是阿拉伯各国人民的问题，是所有为反对美帝国主义、殖民主义和反动派而进行斗争的各国人民的问题，特别是为了争取解放、独立和提高社会地位而进行英勇斗争的亚、非、拉人民的问题。巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民斗争的胜利将是阿拉伯各国人民和全世界爱好自由人民的胜利，也将是为了反对共同敌人而进行斗争的被压迫人民的胜利。
    哈米德说，巴勒斯坦解放组织成立后，确认武装斗争的原则是争取解放巴勒斯坦和收复沦陷的国土的一项决定性措施。巴勒斯坦人民的斗争因而进入了一个新阶段。全世界支持巴勒斯坦人民正义事业的人们，越来越了解、同情和支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争。
    哈米德指出，今天全世界人民认识到，犹太复国主义只不过是帝国主义和殖民主义的一只走狗而已。以色列侵略阿拉伯叙利亚的事件只不过是国际帝国主义企图控制世界的总计划的一部分。阿拉伯各国人民把自己的斗争和世界各国人民的斗争紧紧联系在一起，尤其把它和正在反抗美帝国主义侵略越南人民的斗争紧紧联系在一起。因为全世界的解放斗争是一个共同事业。
    哈米德说，最近在中东地区发生的事件，证实了阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义及其走狗以色列的革命积极性。
    他最后表示感谢人民中国政府、中国共产党和人民支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对帝国主义、世界犹太复国主义和国际反动派的斗争。
    首都工农兵和红卫兵代表刘锡昌在讲话中首先表示向英勇斗争的巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民致以革命造反者的敬礼。他说，巴勒斯坦人民从切身的经验中认识到，武装斗争是巴勒斯坦人民取得胜利的唯一正确的道路。巴勒斯坦人民已经拿起武器，为实现重返家园、解放国土的民族愿望而战斗了。
    刘锡昌说，美帝国主义不但是巴勒斯坦人民的死敌，也是阿拉伯各国人民的共同敌人。巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民在斗争中日益识破了苏修充当美帝帮凶的叛徒真面目。事实证明，苏修领导集团是阿拉伯人民的敌人。他们倒行逆施绝不会有好下场。
    刘锡昌说，中国人民今天在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下所进行的震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利。我们的胜利是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的沉重打击。他说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国的工农兵和红卫兵永远是巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的坚强后盾。在反对美帝国主义及其帮凶和走狗的斗争中，中国人民永远和巴勒斯坦及阿拉伯各国人民团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。
    在大会上，中国人民解放军代表宣读了大会支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列斗争的电文。全场高呼口号：
    “巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民必胜！美帝必败！”
    “中国人民同巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民的战斗友谊万岁！”
    “无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”
    “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    “伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    大会结束时，全场高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《国际歌》。
