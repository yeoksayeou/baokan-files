Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the steering wheel for our literary and artistic work. For all the monsters and demons, it is a demon mirror.

Over the past decade, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles have used drama, music, dance, and other means to poison our workers, peasants, and soldiers, creating public opinion for their capitalist restoration. They performed the reactionary Peking opera "The Orphan of Zhao" and "The Pot Scheme" in our factory, and showed poisonous films and yellow music. At the time, many workers were very angry after watching these garbage. We studied "Talks" with this question in mind. Using "Talks" as a demon mirror, these monsters and demons were exposed. Some old workers excitedly said: "Chairman Mao said that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but they showed us these garbage. We workers, peasants, and soldiers must seize all the literary and artistic positions from the bourgeoisie." Thus, our factory's propaganda team was established.

After the propaganda team was established, we used "Talks" as the steering wheel and compiled short literary and artistic performances about the heroic deeds of the working class, which shine with Mao Zedong Thought. Worker comrades watched the performance and excitedly said: "This is about our workers' struggle, it's exciting to watch, it's great!"

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our propaganda team again used "Talks" as the steering wheel and used revolutionary literature and art as a weapon to criticize the number one capitalist-roader in the Party's fallacy of "exploitation is reasonable." We re-performed the sculpture drama "The Opium Den." Workers who watched the play said: "The Opium Den talks about the landlord's cruel exploitation of peasants, and in the past, the capitalist's exploitation and oppression of workers was the same! The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party says 'exploitation is reasonable,' this is pure evil talk, we must overthrow him!"

We will use "Talks" as the demon mirror and steering wheel for life, making literature and art forever a powerful weapon to "unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy."

    方向盘　照妖镜
    北京第一机床厂红色造反宣传队
    毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是咱们文艺工作的方向盘，对于一切牛鬼蛇神，则是一面照妖镜。
    十多年来，文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用戏剧、音乐、舞蹈等对咱们工农兵放毒，为他们复辟资本主义大造舆论。他们到我们工厂大演反动京剧《四郎探母》、《乌盆计》，大放毒草电影和黄色音乐。当时，不少工人看了这些乌七八糟的臭垃圾感到十分气愤。我们就带着这个问题学习《讲话》。拿《讲话》这面照妖镜一照，这些牛鬼蛇神就原形毕露了。有些老工人激动地说：“毛主席说文艺应该为工农兵服务，可是他们却给咱们工人看这些乌七八糟的东西。咱们工农兵要把一切文艺阵地从资产阶级手里夺回来。”于是，我们工厂的工人宣传队成立了。
    宣传队成立后，咱们以《讲话》为方向盘，把闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的工人阶级的英雄事迹，编成短小的文艺节目。工人同志们看了演出，兴奋地说：“这是演咱们工人自己的斗争，看了就是带劲儿，就是好！”
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们宣传队又以《讲话》为方向盘，用革命文艺这一武器，批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派关于“剥削有理”的谬论，重新演出了雕塑剧《收租院》。看过戏的工人说：“收租院里讲的是地主对农民的残酷剥削，过去资本家对工人的剥削压榨也是这样！党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派胡说什么‘剥削有理’，这纯粹是黑心说毒话，我们一定要把他打倒！”
    我们要一辈子用《讲话》作照妖镜和方向盘，使文艺永远成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器。
