Workers besiege factory managers, cut off water and electricity, burn factory buildings and cars
Indian people's struggle for survival and against tyranny surges ahead
Four thousand striking workers in Uttar Pradesh fight back against military-police suppression with homemade guns, hand grenades, and sulfuric acid bottles

New Delhi, May 18 (Xinhua) - In West Bengal, India, neither the bullets and batons of the reactionary military and police nor the sweet talk of a handful of revisionist lackeys of the Soviet revisionists can stop the Indian people's struggle for survival and against tyranny from continuing to develop.

Recently, the West Bengal government, which traitor Dange calls a "people's government of the non-Congress parties," has repeatedly sent armed police to open fire and massacre local people.

In the southeastern suburbs of the state capital, Calcutta, local residents set fire to a capitalist's property on the evening of May 16. On the morning of May 17, the reactionary authorities sent police to suppress and arrest the people. The people, unable to bear it any longer, angrily attacked the police station with soda bottles and explosives. The police opened fire on these people resisting violent oppression, injuring several.

In Ranaghat, about 30 miles from Calcutta, large-scale anti-tyranny struggles also took place on the night of May 14 and the morning of May 15. About 10,000 angry people besieged the police station to protest the arbitrary arrest of local police. The police fired twice on the crowd, killing three and injuring many.

After the incident, the deputy chief minister of West Bengal went to the scene and asked the people to "help maintain peace."

The industry and commerce minister of this state recently came out to attack the workers' just actions against capitalists. The minister said that a large amount of "public property" had been invested in "state-owned" enterprises, and the workers' actions would disrupt the work of these enterprises and make the "United Front state government" feel embarrassed. The minister of iron and metal also shouted that the "stable society" should not be threatened, that "civilized negotiation methods" should be used, and not to "cause trouble," and so on. In short, it is to make the workers be exploited, oppressed, and slaughtered, and not to carry out violent resistance.

The chief minister of this state, K. Mukherjee, issued a statement on May 16, openly threatening the people not to use sticks, bows and arrows, spears, and other weapons to seize government and private property. His government has the "responsibility to protect the safety and property of every citizen," which is actually to protect the safety and property of capitalists and landlords. Mukherjee's statement exposes this so-called "people's government" as nothing more than a watchdog of the exploiting class. Lies cannot deceive people. The Indian people continue to use violence to fight for their right to survive. On May 16, four thousand striking workers at the Ramganga Dam construction site in Uttar Pradesh bravely fought back against armed police with homemade guns, hand grenades, and sulfuric acid bottles, frightening the reactionary authorities.

The Indian people's struggle against hunger, tyranny, and for survival is entering a new high tide. The Indian working class is showing more and more heroic fighting spirit in this struggle. To oppose the newly formed Congress Party government and the exploitation and oppression of domestic and foreign capital, they have not been deterred by the reactionary government's suppression and have recently held strikes and demonstrations in many places.

In West Bengal, where the traitor Dange clique praises the "non-Congress people's government," workers have held 144 demonstrations from early March to May 1. They besieged the offices of capitalists and besieged 500 capitalists in total. In the suburbs of Calcutta, in the town of Cossipore, a gun and ammunition factory with 12,000 workers went on strike on the night of May 9. On May 10, workers demonstrated to protest the factory's capitalist deducting workers' food. Angry crowds smashed the manager's office and attacked the manager.

The employees of the Calcutta municipal government besieged the mayor, deputy mayor, and councilors on May 12. The deputy commissioner and other officials of the reactionary Indian government in this area were also besieged by more than 200 employees on the same day.

In Dhanbad, Bihar, three thousand workers of a large fertilizer factory held a demonstration on May 4, demanding a reasonable distribution of food, and besieged the factory manager in his office for three hours.

In Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh, workers of a cardboard factory besieged the chairman and manager in their homes for four days to protest the capitalist's arbitrary closure of the factory, cutting off their water and electricity supply.

In Viramgam, Gujarat, a thousand workers of an American-owned synthetic silk factory, because the employer unreasonably laid off workers, sparked strong resistance from the workers. On April 21, angry workers set fire to the factory and cars parked inside.

On May 10, workers of the English-owned Indian Cable Company in Jamshedpur, Bihar, besieged the company's capitalists for 16 hours, protesting the employer's dismissal of 150 employees and demanding that the employer immediately restore their jobs. On May 11, a large number of police arrived at the scene to suppress the workers, which led to more intense resistance from the workers. Angry crowds broke through the police cordon and threw stones at the police. Seven police officers and eighteen policemen were injured.

    围困工厂经理　切断水电供应　焚烧厂房汽车
    印度人民争生存反暴政斗争怒潮汹涌
    北方邦四千罢工工人用土枪、手榴弹、硫酸瓶英勇反击军警镇压
    新华社十八日讯　新德里消息：在印度的西孟加拉邦，无论是反动军警的枪弹和警棍，无论是充当苏修走狗的一小撮修正主义分子的甜言蜜语，都不能阻止印度人民争生存、反暴政斗争的继续发展。
    最近，被叛徒丹吉称为“非国大党的人民政府”的西孟加拉邦政府，一再出动武装警察，开枪屠杀当地人民。
    在这个邦政府所在地加尔各答的东南郊区，当地群众在十六日晚间曾经放火烧毁一个资本家的财产。十七日早上，反动当局出动警察进行镇压和逮捕。群众忍无可忍，愤怒地用汽水瓶子和爆炸物袭击了警察局。警察向这些反抗暴力压迫的群众开枪，打伤了几个人。
    在离开加尔各答大约三十英里的腊纳加特地方，十四日晚间和十五日早上也发生了大规模的抗暴斗争。大约一万名愤怒的群众为了抗议当地警察无理抓人，包围了警察局。警察两次向群众开枪，打死三人，打伤许多人。
    事后，西孟加拉邦政府的副首席部长前往出事地点，要求群众“帮助保持平静”。
    这个邦政府的工商业部长最近跳出来大肆攻击工人群众反对资本家的正义行动。这个部长说什么在“邦营”企业中投进了一大笔“公共财产”，工人的行动会搞乱这些企业的工作，会使“联合阵线的邦政府感到为难”。铁矿和金属部长也叫嚷什么不要使“稳定的社会”受威胁啦，要用“文明的谈判方式，不要乱搞”啦，等等。总之是要工人老老实实被剥削，被压迫，被屠杀，不要实行暴力反抗。
    这个邦的首席部长库·慕克吉十六日发表声明，露骨地威胁群众不得使用木棒、弓箭、梭镖等武器，去侵占政府和私人财产。他的邦政府“有责任保护每个市民的安全和财产”，实际上是保护资本家、地主的安全和财产。慕克吉的这个声明，暴露出这个所谓“人民政府”，只不过是剥削阶级的看家狗。谎言骗不了人。印度人民继续使用暴力争取生存的权利。北方邦拉姆甘加水坝工地上的四千名罢工工人，十六日使用了土制手枪、手榴弹、硫酸瓶同武装警察进行了英勇的搏斗，吓得反动当局胆颤心惊。
    本报综合报道　印度人民反饥饿、反暴政、争生存的斗争，正在进入一个新的高潮。印度工人阶级在这个斗争中日益显示出英勇的斗争精神。他们为了反对新上台的国大党政府以及本国和外国资本的剥削和压迫，不顾反动政府的镇压，最近在许多地方举行了罢工示威。
    在被丹吉叛徒集团吹捧为“非国大党的人民政府”当政的西孟加拉邦，从三月初到五月一日，工人们已举行了一百四十四起示威活动。他们包围资本家的办事处，先后围困了五百个资本家。在加尔各答市郊区科西普尔的一个拥有一万二千工人的枪炮弹药工厂，九日晚工人开始罢工。十日工人举行示威，抗议这个厂的资本家克扣工人伙食。愤怒的群众砸了总经理的办公室，袭击了总经理。
    加尔各答市政府的雇员十二日包围了市长、副市长和市议员。印度反动政府在这个地区的代理专员等官员同一天也被二百多名职工包围。
    比哈尔邦丹巴德地方一家大肥料工厂的三千工人，四日举行示威，要求合理分配粮食，把工厂总经理围困在办事处内达三小时之久。
    北方邦密拉特的一家纸板厂工人为了抗议资本家无理关厂，把董事长和经理围困在家里达四天之久，切断了给他们的水电供应。
    古吉拉特邦维拉瓦尔的一家拥有一千多名工人的美资人造丝厂，因资方无理解雇工人，激起工人强烈反抗。愤怒的工人于四月二十一日放火焚烧工厂和停在厂内的汽车。
    五月十日，比哈尔邦詹谢普尔英商印度电缆公司的职工把这个公司的资本家包围了十六个小时，抗议资方解雇一百五十名雇员，要求资方立即恢复他们的工作。十一日大批警察赶到现场进行镇压，引起了职工们更激烈的反抗。愤怒的群众冲破警戒线，向警察猛烈地投掷石块。有七名警官和十八名警察被打伤。
