Japanese revolutionary people have successively spoken to Chinese journalists, enthusiastically hailing the publication of the articles "The Crux of 'In Cultivation' is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" by the editorial departments of Red Flag Magazine and People's Daily. They warmly praise the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, for his outstanding contributions to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The head of the Kyoto branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox), Kon'do Ryōzō, said, "The publication of the articles by the editorial departments of Red Flag Magazine and People's Daily is excellent. It is like a heavy artillery shell, striking a heavy blow against the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party and his supporting counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, as well as the revisionist cliques internationally."

Kon'do said, "The article clearly points out that the core issue of Marxist-Leninist theory is the dictatorship of the proletariat, indicating the direction of struggle for the revolutionary people of the world, that is, the proletariat must seize power through armed struggle, establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, and only through the dictatorship of the proletariat can one reach communism."

A Japanese friend from Kyoto City, Koda, said, "In Cultivation' strips away the core of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—the dictatorship of the proletariat, making people forget the socialist revolution, forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and engage in 'self-cultivation.' The result can only lead people down the path of revisionism."

Koda pointed out: "The evil intention of 'In Cultivation' is to negate the dictatorship of the proletariat, establish bourgeois dictatorship in China, and shake hands with the modern revisionist clique in the Soviet Union and revisionist elements in various countries."

Koda said, "This poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought, 'In Cultivation,' not only spreads poison in China but also poisons the world. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which makes outstanding contributions to the world revolution, it is necessary to thoroughly criticize 'In Cultivation' and eliminate its poison."

He said, "Only with Mao Zedong Thought, this scientific theory of Marxism-Leninism, can the revisionist fallacies of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party be thoroughly smashed."

    日本朋友欢呼《红旗》和《人民日报》编辑部文章的发表
    《修养》的要害是背叛无产阶级专政
    必须彻底批判《修养》，肃清它在世界上的流毒
    据新华社东京二十日电　日本革命人民相继向中国记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部文章《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》的发表，热情赞扬世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席对马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政学说做出的卓越贡献。
    日中友好协会（正统）京都总部负责人近藤良男说，《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部文章的发表好得很，它象一颗重炮弹，沉重地打击了中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他支持的反革命修正主义集团，以及国际上的修正主义集团。
    近藤说，这篇文章明确地指出了马克思列宁主义学说的核心问题是无产阶级专政，给全世界革命人民指出了斗争方向，即无产阶级必须武装夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政，并且只有通过无产阶级专政才能到达共产主义。
    京都市一位日本朋友古田说，《修养》抽掉了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的核心——无产阶级专政，要人们忘记社会主义革命，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，去进行“自我修养”，其结果只能把人们引上修正主义道路。
    古田指出：《修养》的恶毒企图在于否定无产阶级专政，在中国建立资产阶级专政，以便同苏联现代修正主义集团和各国的修正主义分子握手言欢。
    古田说，《修养》这棵反毛泽东思想的大毒草，不仅流毒中国，而且流毒世界。在对世界革命做出卓越贡献的中国无产阶级文化大革命中，必须彻底批判《修养》，肃清它的流毒。
    他说，只有用毛泽东思想这一马克思列宁主义的科学理论，才能彻底粉碎中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义谬论。
