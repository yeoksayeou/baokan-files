According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 23rd - The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionary people in Shanghai, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, held a grand meeting today to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They enthusiastically hailed the brilliant victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and enthusiastically celebrated the great achievements of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries are determined to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, use the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and actively learn and apply the "Speech" to further develop the struggle between the two lines in the field of literature and art. They will thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, and completely criticize and denounce this black line and its chief backer, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pushing the revolutionary criticism movement to a new stage, and fighting to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Today's meeting was held at the Cultural Revolution Square. Before the meeting, more than ten thousand proletarian revolutionary fighters and revolutionary masses from the fields of literature, industry, agriculture, commerce, and the military repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's quotations on culture and art.

The meeting was presided over by Comrade Zhang Chunqiao, a member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. Comrade Yao Wenyuan, a member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, delivered a lengthy speech at the meeting (the full text is on the second page). Attending the meeting were also Wang Shaoyong and Ma Tianhui of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, Li Binshan, Gao Zhiren, and Ji Yingwu, responsible comrades of the PLA units stationed in Shanghai, and representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations in Shanghai.

In his speech, Comrade Yao Wenyuan reviewed the history of the struggle between the two lines in the field of literature and art over the past 25 years and expounded on the great historical significance of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in the history of the international communist movement and the world proletarian literary and artistic movement. He said, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a brilliant crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought, an immortal document of Marxism-Leninism, a milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism's worldview and literary theory, a programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a resounding call to action for the oppressed peoples of the world to bravely charge against imperialism and all reactionaries. Comrade Yao Wenyuan said: Chairman Mao's theory on carrying out a proletarian cultural revolution from the bottom up under the dictatorship of the proletariat, starting from criticizing the representatives of the bourgeoisie in the ideological and cultural sphere, exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, preventing capitalist restoration, and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, is a creative development of the spirit of the "Speech" in the period of socialist revolution, a milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism, and a great innovation in the international communist movement.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan pointed out that, in opposition to the bourgeois reactionary line on literature and art represented by Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Moquan, and Qi Yanming (the counter-revolutionary revisionist line on literature and art), Comrade Jiang Qing has firmly upheld Chairman Mao's proletarian line on literature and art as expounded in the "Speech" and has waged a tenacious struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line on literature and art, making a significant contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan said: In commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Speech," we must first seriously study Chairman Mao's great work and other great works on the cultural revolution, and use them as our most important weapons in the great criticism. We must thoroughly destroy the positions occupied by the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, eliminate their poison, expose all their underground activities, and truly seize the leadership from the proletarian revolutionaries. Furthermore, we must thoroughly criticize and denounce the chief backer of the literary and artistic black line—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—and push the revolutionary criticism movement to a new high.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan said: In commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Speech," we must adhere to Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and reform work in various units in the field of literature and art. The staff of literary and artistic troupes should return to their units, concentrate their efforts on thoroughly carrying out the revolution. While struggling, criticizing, and reforming within their units, they should also create and rehearse modern revolutionary literary and artistic works and operas that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Comrade Yao Wenyuan said: In commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Speech," we must seriously implement the mass line in all aspects, strengthen self-reform, and use the worldview of the proletariat to overcome various non-proletarian thoughts in our ranks.

Representatives from Shanghai's workers, peasants, and soldiers spoke passionately: Chairman Mao loves and cares for the workers, peasants, and soldiers the most and believes in and relies on them the most. Chairman Mao's direction of proletarian literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is the fundamental guarantee for the complete liberation and emancipation of the billion-strong workers and peasants in the field of literature and art. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road hate and fear the workers, peasants, and soldiers the most and oppose literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers the most. With their support, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists represented by Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan proposed "popular literature and art," openly opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art. But the wings of a crow can never block the sun. The great Mao Zedong thought on literature and art, the proletarian direction of literature and art that is supported by the billion-strong workers and peasants, no one can oppose! In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries have exposed this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and their chief backer, and removed the stumbling block to implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives from the Shanghai Peking Opera House and the Shanghai Dance School highly praised Comrade Jiang Qing's outstanding contributions in firmly defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They said that the task facing revolutionary literary and artistic workers is still very arduous, but we have a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and to the great thoughts of the "Speech." With Comrade Jiang Qing leading us into battle, we will definitely advance bravely along the revolutionary direction of literature and art indicated by Chairman Mao and create epoch-making proletarian new literature and art!

Representatives from the Shanghai Youth Drama Troupe and the East Is Red Film Studio revolutionary faction said that by re-studying the "Speech," they felt even more the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally led and initiated by Chairman Mao.

The meeting ended in the most enthusiastic shouts of "Long Live Chairman Mao!" After the meeting, performances of short, concise, and combative programs and the revolutionary symphony "Sha Jiachuan" that shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought were warmly received by the entire audience.

    上海盛会纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年
    以《讲话》为武器把大批判推向新高潮
    张春桥同志主持大会　姚文元同志讲了话　革命群众决心为保卫无产阶级专政而斗争
    据新华社上海二十三日电　上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，怀着对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，今天隆重集会，纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，热烈欢呼一年来无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，热烈庆祝毛主席的革命文艺路线的巨大成就。
    广大无产阶级革命派决心高举革命的批判旗帜，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以光焰无际的毛泽东思想为武器，活学活用《讲话》，进一步开展文艺路线上两条路线的斗争，大破反革命修正主义的文艺黑线，彻底批倒批臭这条黑线和它的总后台党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把革命的大批判运动推向一个新的阶段，为捍卫无产阶级专政而斗争。
    今天的大会在文化革命广场举行。会前，来自文艺、工业、农业、财贸、军事等各条战线的一万多名无产阶级革命派战士和革命群众，反复诵读毛主席关于文化艺术的语录。
    大会由上海市革命委员会领导成员张春桥同志主持。上海市革命委员会领导成员姚文元同志在会上作了长篇讲话（全文见第二版）。出席大会的，还有上海市革命委员会王少庸、马天水，人民解放军驻上海部队负责人李彬山、高志荣、姬应伍，以及上海各革命群众组织负责人。
    姚文元同志在讲话中回顾了二十五年来文艺战线上两条路线斗争的历史，论述了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》在国际共产主义运动和全世界无产阶级文艺运动史上的重大历史意义。他说，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是毛泽东思想的光辉结晶，是马克思列宁主义的不朽文献，是对马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的划时代的发展，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性的文件，是鼓舞全世界被压迫人民向帝国主义和一切反动派进行勇敢冲击的响亮的斗争号角。姚文元同志说：毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下开展自下而上的无产阶级文化大革命，从批判思想文化领域中资产阶级代表人物入手，揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政的理论，是《讲话》的精神在社会主义革命时期创造性的发展，是马克思列宁主义划时代的发展，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。
    姚文元同志指出，同以周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭为代表的资产阶级反动文艺路线（即反革命修正主义文艺路线）相对立，江青同志坚持了《讲话》中阐明的毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，同资产阶级反动文艺路线进行了顽强不屈的斗争，对于无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大的贡献。
    姚文元同志说：我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，首先要认真地学习毛主席这篇伟大著作和其他关于文化革命的伟大著作，当作我们进行大批判的最重要的战斗武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上、组织上彻底摧毁反革命修正主义文艺黑线所占据着的阵地，肃清它们的毒素，弄清它们的一切地下活动，把领导权真正夺到无产阶级革命派手中来，并且进一步彻底批臭文艺黑线的总后台——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把革命的大批判运动推向一个新的高潮。
    姚文元同志说：我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，要坚持毛主席的工农兵方向，搞好文艺领域各单位的斗批改的工作。文艺团体的工作人员，应当回到本单位，集中力量彻底闹革命。一面进行本单位的斗、批、改，一面创作和排演现代的革命化的为工农兵服务的文艺作品和戏曲。
    姚文元同志说：我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，要认真地在各个方面贯彻群众路线，加强自我改造，用无产阶级世界观来克服我们队伍中的各种非无产阶级思想。
    上海工、农、兵代表在发言中满怀激情地说：毛主席最热爱和关怀工农兵，最相信和依靠工农兵。毛主席提出的无产阶级文艺为工农兵服务这一方向，是我们亿万工农兵群众取得文学艺术上彻底解放、彻底翻身的根本保证。但是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派最仇视和害怕工农兵，最反对文艺为工农兵服务。在他的支持下，以彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍为代表的一小撮反革命修正主义分子提出了“全民文艺”，公然与毛主席的革命文艺路线相对抗。但是，乌鸦的翅膀终究遮不住太阳，伟大的毛泽东文艺思想，受到亿万工农兵群众拥护的无产阶级文艺方向，谁也反对不了！在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台揪出来了，把贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线的绊脚石踢开了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    上海京剧院、上海市舞蹈学校的代表在发言时高度颂扬了江青同志在坚决捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线和无产阶级文化大革命中的卓越贡献。他们说，摆在革命文艺工作者面前的任务还十分艰巨，但是我们有一颗永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于《讲话》伟大思想的红心，有江青同志领导着我们冲锋陷阵，就一定能够沿着毛主席指引的革命文艺方向勇往直前，创造出划时代的无产阶级新文艺！
    上海青年话剧团、东方红电影制片厂革命派代表在发言中说，重新学习《讲话》，更感到毛主席亲自领导和发动的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。
    大会在最最热烈的“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声中胜利结束。会后，演出了闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉、富于战斗性的短小精悍的节目和革命交响乐《沙家浜》，受到了全场热烈欢迎。
