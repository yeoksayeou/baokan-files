The exhibition of the deeds of the "South Sea Hero Ship" No. 1018, hailed as a heroic collective in aiding Vietnam and resisting America, officially opened in Guangzhou on the 4th. This exhibition is a vivid lesson in the education of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply imparting to people the education of internationalism, patriotism, and revolutionary heroism.

On August 29, 1966, while this small cargo ship was carrying out its mission of aiding Vietnam and resisting America on its normal route in the Gulf of Tonkin, it was savagely attacked by American imperialist military aircraft. The crew, who held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in their motherland, put proletarian politics in command, steadfastly held their posts, and bravely fought against the enemy planes for three hours. They demonstrated the revolutionary heroic spirit of the Chinese people daring to struggle and daring to win. After the ship was bombed and sunk, the crew, injured, swam across the sea and finally, with the warm concern and help of the peoples of China and Vietnam, returned victoriously to their motherland.

The exhibition is divided into three parts: People armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible; Thinking of Chairman Mao adds boundless strength; Forever advancing on the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao. The exhibition, through paintings, sculptures, and actual objects, vividly introduces the heroic deeds of the crew of the hero ship.

    “南海英雄船”事迹在广州展出
    被誉为援越抗美英雄集体的“南海英雄船”一零一八号的事迹展览，四日在广州市正式展出。这一展览，是一堂极其生动的毛泽东思想教育课，使人们深刻地受到国际主义、爱国主义和革命英雄主义的教育。
    一九六六年八月二十九日，这艘小货船在北部湾正常航线上执行援越抗美运输任务中，遭到美帝国主义军用飞机的疯狂袭击。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的船员们，在祖国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，突出无产阶级政治，坚守岗位，顽强地同敌机进行了三小时的英勇搏斗，表现了中国人民敢于斗争，敢于胜利的革命英雄气概。船被炸沉以后，船员们又带伤游过大海，终于在中越两国人民亲切关怀和帮助下，胜利地回到祖国。
    展览共分三部分：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人无敌于天下；想起了毛主席就增添了无穷的力量；在毛主席开辟的革命航道上永远前进。展览会通过图画、雕塑和实物，生动地介绍了英雄船员们的战斗事迹。
