The soldiers of the "Leifeng Class" love what the people love and hate what the people hate, just like Leifeng. With boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, they recalled the bitter childhood of Comrade Leifeng and their own family history of blood and tears, using vivid facts to denounce the absurd theory of "exploitation is meritorious" by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party. Below are the speeches of some soldiers from the "Leifeng Class."

Exploitation System is the Root of the Suffering of the Working People

Soldier He Shaoyong

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." What kind of vine produces what kind of gourd, what class speaks what words. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party has long been the spokesperson for the exploiting class, loudly praising the bloodthirsty exploitation system, singing praises for it, and shouting at the top of his lungs the absurd theories of "exploitation is guiltless" and "exploitation is meritorious." He rants about how "the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it." The more factories the capitalists build, the more workers they exploit, the better. This is a great insult to the working people, the voice of a true bloodsucker, and a thorough and complete counter-revolutionary fallacy.

Is exploitation really "meritorious"? Comrade Leifeng once wrote in his diary: "The evil old society drove the poor to become ghosts; the ferocious three enemies caused people to be separated from their families, homes destroyed, and lives ruined. The dark old society was a society that ate people, it ate up my whole family. No! It ate up thousands and millions of poor people. 'Mass graves' and 'towers of bones' are the evidence of the old society eating people." My hometown in Sichuan Province has a notorious landlord estate. This is a "hell palace" built by the labor of the people for the big landlord Liu Wen Cai. This bloodsucker, who made his fortune through exploitation, owns a large amount of land and houses. Who knows how many laborers toiled for him, shedding blood and sweat. The grain they harvested flowed like water into Liu's granary. In the old society, there were not just one or two such bloodsuckers like Liu Wen Cai. Big and small Liu Wen Cais, their stories of making a fortune are all histories of crimes that do not get fat without eating the poor and do not get rich without killing the poor. Their paradise is built on the bones of the working people. For them, without exploitation there is nothing, with exploitation there is everything. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party says that the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it, this is sheer nonsense. We working people suffered greatly under the oppression and exploitation of landlords and capitalists in the old society, we hate the exploitation system to the core, and we are sworn enemies with it. Only landlords and capitalists, and the number one capitalist-roader in the Party who breathes the same air as them, welcome the exploitation system.

The number one capitalist-roader in the Party and the landlords and capitalists have the same dreams and sing the same tune. He dreams of capitalism day and night, longs for capitalism, advocates for capitalism everywhere, and actually practices capitalism. The reason he desperately promotes the absurd and reactionary theory of "exploitation is meritorious" is to make the working people not overthrow the bourgeoisie, not rebel against the bourgeoisie, and attempt to drag us back into the abyss of the old society, to restore capitalism in our country, and make us working people become beasts of burden again. Chairman Mao says: "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost, they must be defended with struggle.... Whoever wants to easily snatch or deceive the rights that the people have already obtained, that is impossible." We must warn the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, you dream of restoring capitalism in China, we, the revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will not allow it! We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, use our blood and lives to defend the victory we have achieved. Whoever dares to snatch the "peach" from our hands, we will fight to the end.

专栏：

    “雷锋班”的战士，象雷锋那样爱人民所爱，恨人民所恨。他们怀着对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的刻骨仇恨，回忆了雷锋同志的苦难童年和自己的血泪家史，以活生生的事实，怒斥党内头号走资本主义道路当权派“剥削有功”的谬论。下面是“雷锋班”部分战士的发言。
    剥削制度是劳动人民苦难的根源
    战士　何少勇
    毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来充当剥削阶级的代言人，大肆吹捧人吃人的剥削制度，为血腥的剥削制度大唱颂歌，声嘶力竭地鼓吹“剥削无罪”、“剥削有功”的谬论。他胡说什么“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削。”资本家“盖的工厂越多，剥削的工人越多，就越好”。这是对劳动人民莫大的污辱，是地地道道的吸血鬼的声音，是彻头彻尾的反革命谬论。
    剥削真的“有功”吗？雷锋同志在他的日记中曾经写道：“万恶的旧社会，把穷人逼成鬼；凶恶的三大敌人，害得人民妻离子散，家破人亡。暗无天日的旧社会是个吃人的旧社会，它吃掉了我一家人。不！它吃掉了千千万万的穷人。‘万人坑’、‘白骨塔’，就是旧社会吃人的证据。”我的家乡四川省，有个臭名远扬的地主庄园。这是大地主刘文彩用劳动人民血肉建造起来的一座“阎王殿”。这个靠剥削起家、剥削发家的吸血鬼，占有大量的土地和房屋。不知有多少劳动人民为他当牛做马、流血流汗。打下的粮食就象流水一样地流进了刘家的仓库。在旧社会，象刘文彩这样的吸血鬼何止一个。大大小小的刘文彩，他们的发家史就是一部不吃穷人不肥、不杀穷人不富的罪恶史。他们的天堂，就是建立在劳动人民的白骨堆上。对于他们来说，没有剥削就没有一切，有了剥削就有了一切。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派说什么劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削，这纯粹是一派胡言。我们劳动人民在旧社会受尽了地主、资本家的剥削压迫，对于剥削制度恨之入骨，和它誓不两立。只有地主和资本家以及同地主、资本家一个鼻孔出气的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，才欢迎剥削制度。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和地主、资本家做着同样的梦，唱着同一个调子。他日夜梦想的是资本主义，向往的是资本主义，到处游说的是资本主义，实际干的还是资本主义。他之所以拚命鼓吹“剥削有功”这样一个荒诞透顶的反动谬论，其目的就是要劳动人民不要革资产阶级的命，不要造资产阶级的反，妄图把我们拉回到旧社会的深渊，在我国复辟资本主义，让我们劳动人民重新当牛做马。毛主席说：“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。……谁要想轻轻易易地把人民已经得到的权利抢去或者骗去，那是办不到的。”我们要正告党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，你梦想在中国复辟资本主义，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，一万个不答应！我们坚决按照毛主席的教导，用鲜血和生命来保卫已得的胜利果实。谁敢从我们手里抢“桃子”，我们就坚决和他拚到底。
