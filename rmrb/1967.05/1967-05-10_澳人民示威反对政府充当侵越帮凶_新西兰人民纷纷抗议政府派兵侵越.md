More than a thousand residents of Melbourne held a demonstration and march on May 7 to protest against the Australian government's support for the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

The demonstrators carried placards denouncing the Holt government as a "puppet of U.S. imperialism" and calling for the withdrawal of Australian troops from South Vietnam.

According to a report from Wellington, the New Zealand government's active support for U.S. imperialism's policy of expanding the war in Vietnam has led to an increase in the number of troops sent to South Vietnam and a rise in military spending. This has had serious economic consequences for New Zealand, including a decrease in the real income of workers, an increase in the cost of living, and a rise in unemployment. All of this has caused great discontent among the people.

Various organizations opposing price increases have been established. They distribute leaflets everywhere, explaining the current economic crisis in New Zealand to the people, condemning the New Zealand government's decision to send troops to participate in the war in Vietnam. They also call on the people to boycott certain goods to force monopolistic capitalists to lower prices.

    新华社墨尔本八日电　墨尔本一千多市民七日举行示威游行，抗议澳大利亚霍尔特政府追随美帝侵略越南。
    示威群众举着的标语牌上，写着谴责霍尔特政府是“美帝国主义的傀儡”和要求从南越撤回澳大利亚军队的口号。
    据新华社惠灵顿电　由于新西兰政府积极追随美帝国主义扩大侵略越南战争的政策，不断增加派往南越的帮凶军队，不断增加军费开支，给新西兰的经济带来了严重的恶果，劳动人民的实际收入减少，生活费用上升，失业增加，这一切都引起了人民极大的不满。
    反对物价上涨的各种群众组织已纷纷建立。他们到处散发传单，向群众宣传目前新西兰的经济危机，谴责新西兰政府派兵参加侵越战争。他们还号召群众对某些商品实行抵制，以迫使垄断资本家降低物价。
