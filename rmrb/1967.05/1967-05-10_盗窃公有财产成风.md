Theft of Public Property Becomes Rampant

In Saratov, the view that socialist ownership is "ownerless" is quite widespread.

    Glazimov scolded his son for stealing cherries from a neighbor's orchard. His son retorted, "And what about you?"

    Glazimov often took small sweet buns from the bakery, wire drawing dies, wooden blocks, and large bottles from the construction unit, and batteries from the machine factory. His son was referring to this.

    Glazimov smiled and said, "The batteries weren't stolen by me, but taken from the factory. Whose are the cherries? The neighbor's. And whose are the batteries? Ownerless. Understand?"

    "Public Property is Not Considered a Crime"

    In some units in Bryansk, theft of public property has become rampant. Not only is it stolen at night, but also in broad daylight, in front of the public and leaders. There, it is generally believed that stealing private property should be severely punished, but stealing public property is not considered a crime, because "he stole from the state, and the state won't become poor because of it."

    (According to the Soviet "Party Life")

    盗窃公有财产成风
    “无主”所有制
    格拉西莫夫责备他的儿子偷邻居果园的樱桃。
    他的孩子说：“你自己怎么样”？
    格拉西莫夫经常从面包房带回小甜面包，从建筑单位带回拉丝模、木块和大瓶子，从机械厂带回电池。他的儿子指的正是这一点。
    格拉西莫夫笑了笑说：“电池不是我偷的，而是从工厂拿来的。樱桃是谁的？邻居的。而电池是谁的？无主人。明白吗？”
    把社会主义所有制看成“无主的”所有制的观点在萨拉托夫是相当广泛地传播的。

    偷公家东西不算犯罪
    在布良斯克城的一些单位，盗窃公有财产成风。不仅夜晚偷，而且白天当着公众和领导人的面偷。在那里，普遍认为偷私人财物要严惩，而偷公共财产不算犯人，因“他偷了公家的东西，而国家并不会因此而变穷。”
