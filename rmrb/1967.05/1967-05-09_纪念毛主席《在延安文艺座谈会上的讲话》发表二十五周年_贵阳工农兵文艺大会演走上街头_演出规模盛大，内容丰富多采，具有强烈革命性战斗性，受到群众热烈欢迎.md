The proletarian revolutionary masses in Guiyang held a grand workers, peasants, and soldiers art festival on the streets to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The festival was grand in scale, rich in content, and highly revolutionary and combative, receiving enthusiastic welcome from the masses.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 8th: The proletarian revolutionary masses in Guiyang jointly organized the "Highly Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Guiyang Region Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art Festival" to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The festival opened on April 30th on the streets of Guiyang.

This art festival was jointly organized by the Guiyang Region Proletarian Revolutionary Headquarters, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guiyang, and 15 other units. The scale of the performance was grand, the content was rich and varied, and it was highly revolutionary and combative. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, the proletarian revolutionary masses took to the stage, full of revolutionary passion, singing praises to our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, and to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Through the festival, they further mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, promoting revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination" in the great revolutionary criticism.

In recent days, more than 1,600 people, including soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Guiyang, revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and some professional artists, formed more than 60 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. They carried Chairman Mao's colorful portraits and quotations and danced their way to more than 20 open-air stages in streets, squares, stations, parks, factories, suburban people's communes, and military units. They performed for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers using concise and powerful art forms such as storytelling, clapper talk, songs, dances, and dramas. They performed more than 600 revolutionary art programs that shone with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, such as "We Miss Chairman Mao," "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Learning from the Good Experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill in Achieving Great Unity Within Administrative Departments," "Strongly Supporting the Liberation Army," "Pulling Down the Chinese Khrushchev," and "Thoroughly Criticizing 'Temperament'." During the performances, the audience applauded enthusiastically and shouted slogans such as "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" "Down with the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road!" "Learn from the Liberation Army!" "Follow the path of the Guiyang Cotton Mill!" They unanimously praised, saying, "This is truly our workers, peasants, and soldiers' own art."
