The great leader Chairman Mao's words, "The world belongs to you, to us, but in the end it belongs to you. You young people are vigorous and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you," shine and nourish the healthy growth of Japanese revolutionary youth like sunlight and rain.

	Wearing the Red Armband Brings Endless Happiness

Recently, a 13-year-old first-year middle school student from Kyoto received a "Mao Zedong Thought Red Guard" armband from a Chinese friend. She was overjoyed and danced with excitement, eagerly putting the armband on her arm and feeling endless happiness.

This student's father is a revolutionary, her mother is an active participant in the Japanese women's movement, and her 16-year-old sister, who is in high school, has already joined the China-Japan friendship movement. She follows her sister's example, striving to do good deeds for China-Japan friendship, taking Mao's Red Guards as her model.

Not long ago, the Kyoto China-Japan Friendship Association (Genuine) headquarters held a report meeting on "The Chinese Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought." She started getting up early every day a few days before the meeting, going out with her sister to do propaganda work on the streets.

	Learning Revolutionary Skills in Stormy Waters

A 16-year-old high school student from the Osaka China-Japan Friendship Academy has a father who is from a poor peasant background, only attended elementary school, and later became a worker, receiving Marxist-Leninist education. His mother is an active participant in the Japanese women's movement. Since the beginning of this year, their family has formed a study group for "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Chairman Mao said, "How do you tell whether a young person is revolutionary or not? What is the criterion? Only one criterion: whether he is willing to and actually does go among the workers and peasants. If he is willing to and actually does, he is revolutionary; otherwise he is not revolutionary, or he is a counter-revolutionary." These words deeply moved his young heart. Inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, he expressed his determination to learn from the young Red Guards of China, striving to unite with the workers and peasants. He said, "We should learn from the Chinese Red Guards, mastering revolutionary skills in stormy waters to serve the workers and peasants."

In March, during a graduation ceremony at a high school in Chiba Prefecture, a graduating student discarded the speech prepared by the school teachers and gave an impromptu speech, enthusiastically praising the heroic deeds of the Chinese Red Guards in the proletarian cultural revolution, and expressing his determination to learn from Chairman Mao's Red Guards. At that time, someone tried to force him to read the original speech. However, inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, he spoke his mind.

	Learning the Revolutionary Spirit of the Red Guards

During a graduation ceremony at another high school in Tokyo, the following incident occurred: The assembly announced that everyone should stand up and sing the Japanese national anthem, which advocates loyalty to the Japanese emperor. Two students refused to sing this reactionary song. After the meeting, they distributed their own mimeographed "Appeal" to their classmates, calling on them to take unified action against the military education policy of the Japanese reactionary authorities.

When asked why they dared to do this, the two students replied without hesitation, "This is the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards."

A young woman from Osaka told a Chinese reporter, "Chairman Mao's Red Guards are truly remarkable. Whether you like it or not, the historical trend is inevitable: in Japan, such Red Guards will definitely emerge. These new masters of the world will surely smash the old world to pieces."

    日本革命青少年热爱毛主席的红小兵
    “世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”伟大的领袖毛主席的这些话，象阳光雨露一样照耀和滋润着日本革命青少年的健康成长。
                戴上红袖章心中无限幸福
    不久以前，京都一个十三岁的初中一年级女学生，从中国朋友那里得到了一个“毛泽东思想红卫兵”的袖章，她高兴得手舞足蹈起来，并激动地把这个袖章戴在自己的胳膊上，感到无限幸福。
    这个女学生的爸爸是一位革命者，妈妈是日本妇女运动的积极分子，正在高中读书的十六岁的姐姐已经参加了日中友好运动。她跟姐姐一道，正以毛主席的红卫兵为榜样，努力为日中友好多做好事。
    不久以前，京都日中友好协会（正统）本部举行一次关于“中国无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东思想”的报告会。她在开会的前几天，每天大清早就起身，同姐姐一道，到街上去做宣传工作。
                在大风大浪中学习革命本领
    大阪日中友好学院有个十六岁的高中生，这个少年的父亲是贫农出身，只上过小学，后来当了工人，接受了马克思列宁主义教育，妈妈是日本妇女运动的积极分子。从今年年初开始，他家成立了一个学习《毛主席语录》小组。毛主席说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”这些话，深深打动了他的幼小心灵。他为中国红卫兵的革命造反精神所鼓舞，表示要向中国的红卫兵小将学习，努力同工农相结合。他说：“我们应该象中国红卫兵那样，在大风大浪里学习革命本领，以便为工农群众服务。”
    三月间，在千叶县一所高级中学举行的毕业典礼上，一位毕业生撇开学校老师原来为他准备好的讲稿，作了即席发言，热情赞扬中国红卫兵在无产阶级文化大革命中创建的英雄事迹，并且表示决心，一定要向毛主席的红卫兵学习。当时，有人曾强使他按原来的讲稿念。但是，他还是在中国红卫兵坚持真理的革命造反精神的鼓舞下，说出了自己的心里话。
               学习红卫兵的革命造反精神
    东京的另一所高级中学在举行毕业典礼时曾发生过这样一件事：大会宣布全体起立，齐唱鼓吹效忠日本天皇的日本国歌。当场有两名学生拒绝唱这首反动歌曲。会后，他们还向同学们散发了自己油印的“呼吁书”，号召同学们一致行动，反对日本反动统治当局奉行的军国主义教育。
    当人们询问这两个同学为什么敢于这样做的时候，他们毫不迟疑地回答说：“这就是中国红卫兵的革命造反精神。”
    大阪的一位女青年对中国记者说：“伟大领袖毛主席的红卫兵确实是了不起的。”“不管你愿意不愿意，历史的发展趋势必然是：在日本，也定将出现这样的红卫兵。这些新世界的主人，定将把旧世界砸个稀巴烂。”　                            新华社记者
