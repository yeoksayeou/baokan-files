The predecessor of the China Youth Art Theatre was the Northeast Cultural and Art Troupe No. 2. After the liberation of the country in 1949, the Northeast Cultural and Art Troupe No. 2 entered Beijing, and before the team had even settled down, a small clique of revisionists, under the instructions of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, disbanded the Northeast Cultural and Art Troupe No. 2. Many revolutionary cadres in the troupe were deemed to have "low cultural level" and were transferred or reassigned. Thus, the theatre prepared the organizational structure for the restoration of capitalism, and the socialist stage gradually fell under the control of bourgeois "authorities" and "experts."

They advocated for the creation of an "art sanctuary" to be run by "artists," openly eliminating the Party's leadership over the arts. They also included a large number of toxic weeds with famous, foreign, and ancient themes in the repertoire, while adopting a hostile attitude towards the numerous works by amateur writers from the working class, peasantry, and soldiers that reflected real struggles. They labeled these works with various accusations such as "thin plot," "lack of depth," "poor technique," and "difficult to preserve," and excluded them.

In 1956, the 20th Congress of the CPSU was held, and Khrushchev put forward a set of revisionist political programs advocating peaceful coexistence, peaceful competition, and peaceful transition. The top capitalist-roader in the Party acted as an echo, singing in unison and responding in harmony. In March 1956, during a report to the old Cultural Department Party Committee, he said, "Let the folk professional troupes continue for another two or three five-year plans; let them compete with state-owned troupes to see who has more audiences and who is more loved by the people." In August of the same year, the Central Experimental Theatre was established, a typical product of the faithful implementation of the black directive from their master by the counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang. At that time, the revisionists in our theatre openly advocated for "shared ideals and shared hardships." What was their "shared ideal"? It was to create a bourgeois free-association theatre.

It was precisely due to the black directive from the top capitalist-roader in the Party that the big and small rightists in the literary and artistic circles were eager to try, determined to establish private troupes, and openly carry out the restoration of capitalism.

In 1962, the 22nd Congress of the CPSU openly peddled the fallacies of the "whole people's state" and "whole people's party." The top capitalist-roader in the Party also vigorously advocated his theory of the "extinction of class struggle," directly opposing Chairman Mao's theory of class and class struggle. Thus, Zhou Yang and his gang, following the instructions of their master, carried out capitalist restoration activities in the literary and artistic circles, shamelessly advocating for the elimination of the Party's leadership in the arts, promoting "whole people's arts," and stipulating that the service objects of the Youth Art Theatre were "primarily youth, with consideration for adults," and the service objects of the Experimental Theatre were "primarily adults, with consideration for youth," completely ignoring the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. A small clique of revisionists in our theatre quickly formulated the "Regulations for Branch Work," stipulating that the Party organization only played a role in ensuring the completion of performance tasks, essentially safeguarding the bourgeois "director-centered" and "actor-centered" theories, and opening the green light for the proliferation of various toxic weeds.

Over the past seventeen years, under the command of the mastermind behind the literary and artistic black line and the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the Youth Art Theatre has collaborated with the counter-revolutionary currents in society, shooting poisoned arrows at the Party, and turning the socialist stage into a mess of chaos.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party is an active supporter and advocate of traitorous arts. As early as 1949, he opposed the ban on performing the big poisonous weed "Four Generations of Loyalty." After the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, he also insidiously told the revisionists at the Central Academy of Drama, "Not only should the performance of positive characters be encouraged, but the performance of negative characters should also be encouraged in the future, and they can even win awards." He also said to the people in our theatre, "Why not perform a big villain in China?" It was during 1962 to 1963 that our theatre consecutively performed "The Beauty," "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," "The Peony Pavilion," and "The Death of Li Xiucheng," four plays that attacked the Party and sang the praises and beautified traitors. These plays sang the praises of those traitors as heroes of the people, using artistic images to summon the spirits of turncoats, and collaborated with the re-emergence of the big poisonous weed "Cultivation," fiercely opposing the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. The reprinting of "Cultivation" and the proliferation of traitorous arts did not reveal their secrets and expose their political conspiracy?

In recent years, Chairman Mao has made several important instructions on the issue of arts. These instructions have hit the vital points of the old Propaganda Department, the old Cultural Department, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, greatly promoting the struggle to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements in the field of arts. However, the top capitalist-roader in the Party openly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions.

In December 1963, Chairman Mao's instructions were issued. In January 3, 1964, the top capitalist-roader in the Party convened a so-called "art forum." At the meeting, Zhou Yang desperately whitewashed the revisionist literary and artistic black line, and the top capitalist-roader in the Party immediately applauded loudly and gave instructions: "Focus on artistic creation," attempting to resist Chairman Mao's criticism, suppress the criticism of the revisionists by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and use this to protect a small clique of revisionists in the literary and artistic circles to pass through.

Chairman Mao pointed out that "socialist transformation in many sectors has achieved very little," but they shouted about great achievements. In March 1964, the old Cultural Department specially held a "modern play awards ceremony," and our theatre alone had four plays, including the big poisonous weed "Three People in a Row," win awards. Chairman Mao pointed out that there are many problems in the literary and artistic circles, but they directly opposed this by proposing "film and drama have creativity." A small clique of revisionists in our theatre, in order to execute this black directive, desperately created a "new atmosphere" in the arts, hastily produced and performed modern plays. Under the personal command of Lin Mo Han and others, they released some poisonous weeds!

History is stern, and debts must be repaid. The top capitalist-roader in the Party has committed unforgivable crimes against the Party and the people, and we must make a thorough settlement with them.

    斩断文艺黑线总后台的魔爪
    中国青年艺术剧院东方红革命造反总部
    中国青年艺术剧院的前身是东北文工二团。一九四九年全国解放后，东北文工二团进入北京，队伍尚未安顿停当，一小撮修正主义分子就在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的指示下，停办了东北文工二团。文工团中的许多革命干部被他们认为“文化水平低”而调走或转业。这样，剧院便在组织机构上为资本主义复辟做了准备，社会主义的话剧舞台就逐渐被资产阶级的“权威”、“专家”所统治了。
    他们鼓吹办“艺术圣殿”，由“艺术家治院”，明目张胆地取消党对文艺的领导。他们还把大量的名、洋、古的毒草列入保留剧目，而对工农兵业余作者大量反映现实斗争的剧目，则采取敌视的态度，给加上“剧本单薄”、“没有挖头”、“技巧不高”、“不易保留”等种种罪名，加以排斥。
    一九五六年，苏共二十大召开，赫鲁晓夫抛出了和平共处、和平竞赛、和平过渡的一整套修正主义的政治纲领。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派当了应声虫，一唱一和，遥相呼应。一九五六年三月，在旧文化部党组汇报工作时，他说：“要让民间职业剧团再搞它二、三个五年计划；让它与国营剧团竞赛，看谁的观众多，看谁最能得到人民喜爱。”同年八月，中央实验话剧院成立，这是周扬等反革命修正主义分子忠实贯彻其后台老板这一黑指示的典型产物。当时我院的修正主义分子就公开鼓吹为“共同理想而同甘共苦”。他们的“共同理想”是什么？就是要搞一个资产阶级自由结合的同人剧院。
    正是由于党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的这道黑指示，文艺界大大小小的右派分子跃跃欲试，一心要搞私人剧团，明目张胆地实行资本主义复辟。
    一九六二年，苏修二十二大公开兜售“全民国家”、“全民党”的谬论，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也大肆鼓吹他的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，与毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争学说大唱反调。于是周扬等一伙秉承其主子的意旨，在文艺界大搞资本主义复辟活动，猖狂地叫嚣文艺界要取消党的领导，提倡“全民文艺”，并规定青艺的服务对象是“青年为主，兼顾成年”，实验话剧院的服务对象是“成年为主，兼顾青年”，闭口不提文艺为工农兵服务的方向。我院一小撮修正主义分子急忙制定了《支部工作条例》，规定党组织仅仅起保证演出任务完成的作用，实质上是保住资产阶级的“导演中心论”和“演员中心论”的一套，为各种毒草的出笼大开绿灯。
    十七年来，青艺在文艺黑线总后台、党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的指挥下，配合社会上的反革命逆流，向党射出一支支毒箭，把社会主义的话剧舞台，搞得乌烟瘴气。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是叛徒文艺的积极支持者和鼓吹者。早在一九四九年，他就反对禁演歌颂民族叛徒的大毒草《四郎探母》。在党的八届十中全会以后，他还心怀叵测地对中央戏剧学院的修正主义分子说：“不但演正面人物要受鼓励，以后演反面人物一样要鼓励，还可以得奖。”又对我院的人说：“为什么不演一个中国的大反派呀？”就在一九六二年到一九六三年间，我院就接连演出了《丽人行》、《上海屋檐下》、《桃花扇》、《李秀成之死》等四出攻击党，歌颂和美化叛徒的毒草戏。这些戏把那些叛徒歌颂为人民的英雄，借助艺术形象为变节分子招魂，配合《修养》这棵大毒草的重新出笼，疯狂地反对光焰无际的毛泽东思想。《修养》的再版和叛徒文艺的泛滥，不正好泄露了他们的天机，暴露了他们的政治大阴谋吗？
    近几年来，毛主席对文艺问题曾多次作了重要的批示。毛主席的这些批示，击中了旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的要害，极大地推动了文艺领域内灭资兴无的斗争。但党内头号走资本主义道路当权派却公然抗拒毛主席的批示。
    一九六三年十二月，毛主席的批示下达。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在一九六四年一月三日召开了一个所谓“文艺座谈会”。会上周扬拚命地为修正主义文艺黑线涂脂抹粉、“评功摆好”，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派马上大声喝彩，并面授机宜：“要抓文艺创作”，妄图以此来抵制毛主席的批评，扼杀广大工农兵对修正主义分子的批判，并借此保护文艺界的一小撮修正主义分子蒙混过关。会后我院党内走资本主义道路的当权派立即调动一切力量，拚命以“立”抗“破”，对抗毛主席的批示。
    毛主席指出“社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微”，他们则叫嚷成绩很大。一九六四年三月，旧文化部还特意举办了“现代剧目发奖大会”，仅我院就有大毒草《三人行》等四个剧目得奖。毛主席指出文艺界“问题不少”，他们则针锋相对地提出“电影，话剧有创造”。我院一小撮修正主义分子为了执行这一黑指示，拚命制造文艺的“新气象”，粗制滥造地套演现代剧。在林默涵等亲自指挥下，抛出了一些毒草戏！
    历史是严峻的，欠债总是要还的。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派对党对人民犯下了不可饶恕的滔天罪行，我们必须向他们作彻底的清算。
