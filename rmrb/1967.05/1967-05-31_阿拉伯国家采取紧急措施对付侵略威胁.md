Arab countries are taking emergency measures to counter invasion threats. The Iraqi government has decided to ban the supply of oil to any country that might invade Arab countries. The Kuwaiti government has decided to cancel the oil interests of the United States and Britain if they collude with Israel to launch an invasion. The Sudanese government has announced a general mobilization and prepared its armed forces to fight alongside the Arab people against invasion.

	According to a broadcast by the Baghdad Radio on May 29, the Iraqi government has decided to ban the supply of oil to any country that might participate in the invasion of Arab countries. On the same day, the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum notified the "Iraq Petroleum Company," which is operated by American, British, French, and Dutch capital, and its subsidiaries of this decision.

	The Iraqi government also invited oil-producing Arab countries and regions to attend a meeting to be held in Baghdad on June 4 to seek a unified stance against countries that collude with Zionism to invade. Earlier, the Kuwaiti Minister of Foreign Affairs had informed the United States and Britain that the Kuwaiti government had decided that if they collude with Israel to invade any Arab country, Kuwait would end their oil interests in Kuwait.

	Meanwhile, the Arab Boycott Office in Damascus announced on May 29 that Arab countries would boycott any shipping company attempting to transport strategic materials, especially oil, to Israel via the Gulf of Aqaba.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the Sudanese government decided on the evening of May 27 that if war breaks out between Arab countries and Israel, Sudan's armed forces would fight alongside the Arab people. The government also announced a general mobilization starting from May 27.

	The Sudanese government also decided to send a delegation, consisting of three ministers, several senior military officers, and a representative from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to consult with the Arab League, the Arab Joint Command, and relevant Arab countries on how to repel Israel's invasion of Arab countries.
