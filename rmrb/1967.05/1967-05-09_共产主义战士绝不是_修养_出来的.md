Title: Communist Warriors Are Not Made by "Cultivation"

Communist warriors are absolutely not made by "cultivation." Chairman Mao teaches us to "serve the people wholeheartedly" and to learn from the great communist warrior Dr. Norman Bethune's spirit of "completely selfless dedication to others." However, the book *Cultivation* arrogantly opposes Chairman Mao, vigorously promoting the decadent bourgeois worldview, spreading the philosophy of survival, advocating bourgeois individualism, personal struggle, and personal "cultivation," attempting to use these rotten ideas to corrupt our Party members and the younger generation, to turn the Marxist-Leninist Party into a revisionist party, and to change the color of the entire China. This is sheer delusion! It is impossible by a thousandfold, by ten thousandfold.

Mao Zedong Thought is the sunshine and rain that nurtures our growth. Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in our hearts. Warriors like Zhang Zedong, Liu Huilan, Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, and Liu Yingjun, who are great communist warriors, which one of them was not nurtured under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, tempered in the storms and broad vistas of class struggle!

My brother Xie Chen's growth into a great communist warrior is a vivid example. In 1960, when Xie Chen first embarked on the revolutionary path, he was just an ordinary youth. However, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, the living education of class struggle, and the tempering of fiery struggle, he quickly became a steadfast warrior with clear distinctions between love and hate. He loved Chairman Mao immensely, studied Chairman Mao's works eagerly, and gradually established a communist worldview of not seeking fame, not seeking personal gain, fearing neither hardship nor death. In daily life, he listened to Chairman Mao's words the most, going wherever needed, loving and excelling in whatever he did, and completing every task assigned by the Party excellently. In 1963, when the severe floods seriously threatened the people's lives and property, he fearlessly faced the dangers and sacrifices, bravely giving his precious life to save the people's lives and property. This selfless communist spirit was cultivated under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and in the fiery revolutionary struggle. If one follows the path advocated by *Cultivation*, detaching from revolutionary struggle and the masses, and engaging in idealistic "cultivation" behind closed doors, one would never become a great communist warrior. If one cultivates and struggles merely for personal gain as advocated by *Cultivation*, one would never be fearless in the face of danger, selflessly saving others, and becoming an immortal hero. The top capitalist-roader in the Party frantically promotes his *Cultivation*, actually aiming to turn the vast number of Party members and cadres into political mediocrities and revisionist successors, to realize his plot of usurping the Party and the government, and restoring capitalism. His ambition is so vast, and his intentions are so malicious!

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage." In the total offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, I will definitely learn from my brother Xie Chen, earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, advance against the waves of class struggle, resolutely deepen and thoroughly criticize *Cultivation*, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    共产主义战士绝不是“修养”出来的
    解放军某部“谢臣班”班长　谢起
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务”，要学习伟大的共产主义战士白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”的精神。可是，《修养》却狂妄地和毛主席唱对台戏，极力宣扬腐朽的资产阶级世界观，散布活命哲学，提倡资产阶级个人主义、个人奋斗和个人“修养”，企图用这些破烂货来腐蚀我们党员，腐蚀我们年青一代，把马列主义的党变成修正主义的党，使整个中国变颜色。这完全是痴心妄想！一千个办不到，一万个办不到。
    毛泽东思想是哺育我们成长的阳光和雨露。毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。象张思德、刘胡兰、雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊等伟大的共产主义战士，哪一个不是在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在阶级斗争的大风雨和大世面中锻炼成长起来的！
    我的哥哥谢臣成长为伟大的共产主义战士的过程，就是一个鲜明的例子。一九六○年，当谢臣同志刚刚踏上革命征途的时候，他还是一个普通青年。可是，经过毛泽东思想的哺育，活生生的阶级斗争教育和火热的斗争生活的磨炼，使他很快成为一个立场坚定、爱憎分明的战士。他无限热爱毛主席，如饥如渴地活学活用毛主席著作，逐渐树立了不为名、不为利、不怕苦、不怕死的共产主义世界观。在平时，他最听毛主席的话，那里需要就到那里去，干一行、爱一行、专一行，在任何岗位上，都出色地完成了党交给的任务。当一九六三年特大洪水严重威胁着人民生命财产的时刻，他不畏艰险，不怕牺牲，为了抢救人民的生命财产，光荣地献出了自己s的宝贵生命。这种舍己为人的共产主义思想品质，就是在毛泽东思想的哺育下，在火热的革命斗争中培植起来的。如果按照《修养》所鼓吹的一套，脱离革命斗争，脱离人民群众，闭门搞唯心主义的“修养”，那就不可能成长为伟大的共产主义战士。如果象《修养》所宣扬的那样，只是为了个人而“修养”，为着个人而奋斗，那也绝不能临危不惧，舍己救人，成为永垂不朽的英雄。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派拚命推销他的《修养》，实际上就是要使广大的党员、干部变成政治上的庸人，变成修正主义的接班人，以实现他篡党、篡政，复辟资本主义的阴谋。其野心何其大，用心何其毒也！
      “宜将剩勇追穷寇”。在向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的总攻击中，我一定要向我的哥哥谢臣同志学习，活学活用毛主席著作，迎着阶级斗争的风浪前进，坚决把《修养》批深、批透，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
