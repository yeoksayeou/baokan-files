Shanghai held a grand performance of revolutionary modern plays to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Talk." The proletarian revolutionary faction of Shanghai's literary and artistic circles organized a grand performance of revolutionary modern plays. In addition to the model Beijing operas "The Red Lantern" and "The Battle of Shanggang," and the revolutionary symphony "The Battle of Shanggang," the performance also included new revolutionary modern literary works such as the large-scale musical "January Storm," the musical "The Red Lantern Shines," the play "The Rent Collection Courtyard," the dance "The Red Army Is Not Afraid of Long Marches," the Suzhou opera "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," the puppet show "Little Eagle of the Snowy Mountains," and the acrobatic dance "Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

These dramas, songs, music, and acrobatics enthusiastically praised the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They depicted the great achievements of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in creating history and their immortal merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The performance was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses.
