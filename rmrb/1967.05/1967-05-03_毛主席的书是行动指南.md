    Chairman Mao's books are our guide to action. In the dense forests of central South Vietnam, there is an old guerrilla fighter who is a veteran platoon leader in a unit of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army. Whenever there is a lull in the fighting, he takes out the works of Chairman Mao and reads them with deep concentration. This has become his habit.

    The old platoon leader not only eagerly reads Chairman Mao's works himself but also often tells others: "Chairman Mao's books are the weapons of our revolutionary people's struggle, our guide to action. They are like a lighthouse in the vast sea, illuminating the path forward for all revolutionary peoples of the world."

    The old platoon leader has four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Over the years, he has carried these precious books with him as he fought his way through the mountains and forests of the south and the dense jungles of the western highlands. On the battlefield, to defeat American imperialism, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army often has to march long distances and fight as they go. No matter how tired the old platoon leader is, he never puts down Chairman Mao's books. He always says: "How can I command the battle without Chairman Mao's precious books? No matter where I go or how tired I am, Chairman Mao's works must always be by my side!"

    毛主席的书是行动指南
    在南越中部地区的密林中有一位老游击战士，他是南越解放军某部的一位老团长。每当战斗一有间隙，他就拿出毛主席著作聚精会神地阅读起来，这已经成为他的习惯了。
    老团长不仅自己热心读毛主席著作，而且经常对人宣传：“毛主席的书，是我们革命人民斗争的武器，行动的指南。它象茫茫大海里的灯塔，给世界上一切革命的人民照亮了前进的航道。”
    老团长有四卷毛泽东选集。几年来，他带着这几卷宝书转战长山南北，走遍西部高原的密林。在战场上，为了消灭美帝国主义，南越解放军经常长途行军，边走边作战。老团长不管怎样累都不肯把毛主席的书放下。他总是这样说：“把毛主席他老人家的宝书放下，我怎么去指挥打仗呢！不管走到那里，累成什么样子，毛主席著作一定要带在身边！”
