	Block the Dark Path to Capitalism
		Team Leader Qu Jianwen

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the biggest and most dangerous "time bomb" buried on the road to communism in our country, and the root cause of the restoration of capitalism. If we do not remove this "time bomb" and eradicate this root of disaster, socialist China will turn into a revisionist China.

	The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, on the one hand, loudly praises the exploitative system of man eating man, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism; on the other hand, he personally takes action, vigorously undermining the foundations of socialism. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, in 1955 and 1956, our country launched a high tide of the three great transformations; in 1958, under the guidance of the three red banners personally formulated by Chairman Mao, the people of our country, with high morale and vigorous spirits, launched a high tide of building socialism. Great achievements were made in industry, agriculture, and other fronts. These achievements aroused the extreme hatred of domestic and foreign class enemies, who, taking advantage of our country's three consecutive years of natural disasters and the difficulties imposed by Soviet revisionism, fiercely attacked the three red banners. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in response to the needs of domestic and foreign class enemies, blatantly advocated "three freedoms and one contract"; the ghosts and snakes in the countryside also quickly jumped out to wave flags and shout slogans, saying things like "individual farming is good," and that production teams should "divide large into small, and small into even smaller," attempting to restore capitalism overnight.

	In my hometown of Shandong, a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, following the instructions of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, fanned the flames everywhere, stirring up a "wind of individual farming." Under the influence of this evil wind, capitalist forces rose in some areas. Take Lizhuang, for example. A small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party once conducted a trial of "three freedoms and one contract" there. They distributed land to the members to cultivate and openly announced: "Whoever cultivates, whoever harvests, the more you harvest, the more you eat." They maliciously propagated: "To eat, you must open up more land, raise sows, which is like a bank," urging the members to abandon collective production and develop capitalism. As a result, some quickly rose to become the new-style rich peasants advocated by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, with "three horses, one plow, and one cart"; while others gradually became poor. Following this, usury, buying and selling land, hiring labor to exploit, and speculation also appeared. It was not until the socialist education movement was launched in the countryside that this evil trend was stopped.

	The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party talks about freedom all the time. Freedom to lend money at high interest! Freedom to hire labor! Freedom to buy and sell land! Freedom to operate businesses! And so on, it's like the "free world" of the West. We must ask: With all these freedoms you propose, where do you want to lead China? Where do you want to place the laboring people? Let me tell you, we are determined to follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist path. We will not be swayed by storms or overturned by reverse currents. We will never turn back. To be honest, we have already experienced the kind of freedom you advocate. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a class society where there is freedom for the exploiting class to exploit the laboring people, there is no freedom for the laboring people not to be exploited." You want to use the beautiful word "freedom" to confuse us, deceive us, and make us turn back. That is a daydream, a futile attempt!

    堵死通向资本主义的黑路
    班长  曲建文
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是埋在我国通向共产主义大道上的最大、最危险的“定时炸弹”，是复辟资本主义的祸根。不排除这颗“定时炸弹”，不铲除这个大祸根，社会主义的中国就会变成修正主义的中国。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，一面大肆吹捧人吃人的剥削制度，为复辟资本主义制造舆论准备；一面赤膊上阵，亲自动手，大挖社会主义墙脚。在毛主席的英明领导下，一九五五年和一九五六年，我国掀起了三大改造的高潮；一九五八年，我国人民在毛主席亲自制订的三面红旗的指引下，斗志昂扬、意气风发地掀起建设社会主义的高潮。工农业以及其他各个战线，都取得了伟大的成就。这些成就引起了国内外阶级敌人的极端仇视，他们利用我国连续三年的自然灾害和苏联修正主义强加给我们的困难，拚命地攻击三面红旗。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派适应国内外阶级敌人的需要，明目张胆地鼓吹“三自一包”；农村中的牛鬼蛇神，也急忙跳出来摇旗呐喊，说什么“单干好”，生产队应该“大化小，小化了”，妄图在一个早上就复辟资本主义。
    在我的家乡山东，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，秉承党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的意旨，到处煽风点火，刮起了一股“单干风”。在这股黑风的影响下，有的地区资本主义势力抬了头。就拿李庄来说吧，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，曾在那里搞“三自一包”的试点。他们把土地包给社员耕种，并公开宣布：“谁种谁收，多收多吃”。他们别有用心地宣传：“要吃饭，多开荒，养母猪，是银行”，要社员放弃集体生产，去发展资本主义。结果，有的很快就上升为党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所提倡的那种“三马一犁一车式”的新式富农；而有的人却慢慢地穷下来。紧跟着出现了放高利贷，出现了买卖土地，出现了雇工剥削，投机倒把也出现了。直到农村开展了社会主义教育运动，才刹住了这股歪风。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，开口一个自由，闭口一个自由。什么放高利贷自由啊！雇工自由啊！买卖土地自由啊！经营自由啊！等等，简直成了西方“自由世界”。我们要问：你提出这么多自由，究竟要把中国引向何处去？要把劳动人民置于何地？告诉你，我们跟着毛主席走社会主义道路是走定了，狂风吹不动，逆流冲不垮，誓死不回头。老实说，对于你所提倡的这种自由，我们早就领教过。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。”你想用自由这个美丽的名词来迷惑我们，欺骗我们，让我们走回头路，那是白日做梦，痴心妄想！
