New Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch staff submitted a protest letter to the British authorities. The strongest protest against the unreasonable beating of our reporter by Hong Kong British police. A solemn demand: severely punish the culprit; apologize to our reporter; guarantee the freedom of news reporters to conduct interviews.

New Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, May 14th - On May 12th, the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency sent five representatives to the British "Governor's Office" to protest the unreasonable beating of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter, Tu Qiang, by Hong Kong British police while he was conducting a legitimate interview near the artificial flower factory in San Po Kong, Kowloon, on May 11th.

At around 3 PM on May 12th, when the five representatives of the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency arrived at the British "Governor's Office," Dai Linzhi avoided meeting them and sent his "aide" out instead. The representatives were extremely indignant and read aloud the protest letter to Dai Linzhi on the spot.

The protest letter condemned that Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Tu Qiang was conducting an interview near the artificial flower factory in San Po Kong, Kowloon, and was unreasonably beaten by Hong Kong British police. The Hong Kong police's adoption of such fascist violence is your order. This not only seriously undermines the freedom of news reporters to conduct interviews but is also a bloody suppression and persecution of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon. For this, all staff of the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency strongly protest against you. The protest letter put forward three solemn demands to Dai Linzhi: first, severely punish the culprit; second, apologize to our reporter; third, guarantee the freedom of news reporters to conduct interviews.
