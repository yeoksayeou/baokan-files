The reactionary military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia is intensifying its plots to launch a larger-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate conspiracy from political, economic, and military angles.

On April 26, Suharto, the head of the Indonesian reactionary regime, convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the so-called "explosive issue of the Chinese," and decided to establish an anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate decision-making body—the "National Committee." According to a report from the Jakarta radio station, this "National Committee," headed by the anti-communist general Sunaso, is composed of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Trade. Its task is to "comprehensively formulate" specific measures for anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate actions. According to a report from the Antara News Agency, the foreign minister of the Indonesian reactionary regime, Malik, revealed that one of the major measures of this "National Committee" to economically persecute patriotic Chinese expatriates is to soon promulgate a regulation to accelerate the implementation of the infamous "Order No. 10." This order, which came into effect on January 1, 1960, had brutally suppressed the vast number of Chinese expatriate small traders living in towns below the county level in Indonesia, causing many patriotic Chinese expatriates to lose their homes and livelihoods.

To further suppress the anti-persecution struggle of patriotic Chinese expatriates militarily, Suharto, after the emergency cabinet meeting, also convened a meeting of regional commanders to hear reports on the anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate situation in the regions under their jurisdiction and to personally give instructions. At the same time, the old hand in anti-Chinese activities, Nasution, also convened a meeting of the leaders of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly to plot further anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate conspiracies.

According to another report, the Indonesian reactionary regime has decided to hold a meeting of the members of the Supreme Court, High Court, and Lower Court in early May to discuss the "various legal aspects of the Chinese issue," attempting to legalize anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate actions in law.

These intensified anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese expatriate conspiracies by the Indonesian reactionaries further expose their deepening crisis and desperate situation. These fascist measures will undoubtedly further promote the struggle of the Indonesian people and patriotic Chinese expatriates.

    印尼反动派正策划大规模反华阴谋
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动军人政权正加紧从政治、经济、军事等方面策划规模更大的反华排华阴谋。
    印尼反动政权头目苏哈托四月二十六日召集紧急内阁会议，讨论了所谓“爆炸性的华人问题”，决定成立反华排华的决策机构——“国家委员会”。据雅加达电台报道，这个以反共将领苏纳索为首的
  “国家委员会”由外交部、内政部、司法部、财政部和贸易部的官员组成，它的任务是“全面制定”反华排华的“具体措施”。据安塔拉通讯社报道，印尼反动政权外交部长马利克透露，这个“国家委员会”在经济上加紧迫害爱国华侨的重大措施之一是不久将颁布一项条例，以便加速执行臭名远扬的“第十号法令”。这个在一九六○年一月一日生效的彻头彻尾的反华法令，曾经残酷地打击了住在印尼县城以下的广大华侨小商贩，使大批爱国华侨倾家荡产，失去生计。
    为了进一步从军事上镇压爱国华侨的反迫害斗争，苏哈托在内阁紧急会议后，还召开了各军区司令会议，听取各军区所管辖地区的反华排华形势汇报，并亲授机宜。在这同时，反华老手纳苏蒂安也召集临时人民协商会议的头目们开会，策划进一步反华排华阴谋。
    另据报道，印尼反动政权已决定五月初举行最高法院、高等法院和低级法院成员会议，讨论“华人问题的各个法律方面”，企图在法律上把反华排华合法化。
    印尼反动派这些加紧反华排华的阴谋，是它危机重重、穷途末路的进一步暴露。这些法西斯措施必将进一步促进印尼人民和爱国华侨的斗争。
