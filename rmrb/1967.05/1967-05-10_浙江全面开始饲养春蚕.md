Zhejiang Province, which ranks first in the country in cocoon production, has now begun large-scale spring silkworm rearing.

This year, the number of spring silkworms reared in Zhejiang's silkworm-producing areas has increased compared to last year, and the quantity of silkworm eggs has increased by more than ten percent.

Before rearing the silkworms, the communes in the silkworm-producing areas have universally organized silkworm-rearing training classes. They have exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and in rearing spring silkworms. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the silkworm-producing areas have, through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. They have expressed their determination to firmly carry out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and to strive for a bumper spring silkworm harvest.
