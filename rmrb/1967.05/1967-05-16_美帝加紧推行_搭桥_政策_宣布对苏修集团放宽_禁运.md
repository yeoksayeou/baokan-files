The U.S. Empire speeds up the implementation of the "bridge-building" policy
Announces easing of embargo on the Soviet revisionist clique

New China News Agency, May 12th: Washington reports that in order to implement the Johnson administration's policy of accelerating U.S.-Soviet collusion, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced on the 11th that it will ease the export restrictions on 26 so-called "non-strategic materials" to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

According to reports, these "non-strategic materials" include construction cranes, peanuts, and grass seeds, among others. Exports of these materials to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries will no longer require special permits from the Department of Commerce.

Last October, the United States had already decided to ease the export restrictions on 400 "non-strategic materials" to these countries. Western news agencies admit that the United States is taking these measures as part of Johnson's "bridge-building" policy towards the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries.

In the context of the U.S. empire and the Soviet revisionists intensifying their collusion on the Vietnam issue and engaging in global deals, the Johnson administration is accelerating the expansion of trade and economic relations to further fuel the capitalist forces in the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. The big and small bosses of the American ruling class are constantly advocating that this will help create a "cooperative atmosphere" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which is not inconsistent with the purpose of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and will help create conditions for the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries to "return to the West." Therefore, it is in the interests of the United States.

    美帝加紧推行“搭桥”政策
    宣布对苏修集团放宽“禁运”
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：为了推行约翰逊政府加紧美苏勾结的政策，美国商务部十一日宣布，对苏联和东欧国家再放宽二十六种所谓“非战略物资”的出口限制。
    据报道，这些放宽出口限制的所谓“非战略物资”包括建筑起重机、花生和草籽等。这些物资今后向苏联和东欧国家出口，不再需要经过商务部的特别许可。
    去年十月，美国就曾经决定对这些国家放宽四百种“非战略物资”的出口限制。西方通讯社承认，美国采取这种措施是约翰逊对苏联和一些东欧国家推行的“搭桥”政策的一部分。
    在美帝和苏修就越南问题加紧勾结和大搞全球交易的情况下，约翰逊政府正在加紧通过扩大贸易和经济关系来促使苏联和一些东欧国家的资本主义势力更加猖獗。美国统治集团的大小头目不断鼓吹，这样做有助于创造美苏间的“合作气氛”，同美国侵越战争“并没有目的上的不一致”，而且有助于创造条件，使苏联和一些东欧国家“回到西方”，因此是符合美国利益的。
