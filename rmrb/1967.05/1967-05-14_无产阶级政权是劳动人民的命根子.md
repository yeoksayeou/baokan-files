The proletarian dictatorship is the lifeline of the working people. Lü Yulan, Party Branch Secretary and Militia Instructor of Dongliushan Production Brigade, Linxi County, Hebei Province.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." Yet, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party vigorously advocates the theory of "class struggle extinguished." They claim that "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended," and "the question of whether socialism or capitalism will prevail in our country has now been resolved," and so on. These are all lies.

Class struggle has not been extinguished. Over the past decade since the founding of the nation, the struggle between the two classes and the two roads has never stopped. Take our village as an example. In recent years, the overthrown landlords and rich peasants have colluded with a small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the village, using every means to undermine the socialist foundation, constantly attempting to restore capitalism. Chairman Mao has long called on us to "organize." We poor and lower-middle peasants have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call, establishing agricultural cooperatives. This group of bad elements then led the way in causing trouble, advocating withdrawal from the cooperatives and individual farming. In 1958, Chairman Mao said: "The People's Commune is good!" We followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, establishing the People's Commune. Again, it was this group of bad elements who, taking advantage of the three years of difficulty in the country, loudly advocated dividing land and individual farming, household contracting of livestock, attempting to destroy the collective economy of the People's Commune. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was still this group of bad elements who thought that the time to "overthrow" had come, and colluded with the "four unclean" cadres who had been removed from their posts, carrying out class revenge and sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. These living facts have thoroughly smashed the reactionary fallacies of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in his poisonous weed "Cultivation," does not mention proletarian dictatorship at all, but shouts that "class struggle has been extinguished," with the purpose of numbing the revolutionary will of the people, attempting to make us abandon class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, in order to achieve their goal of usurping proletarian power. In our village, the small clique of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party sings the same tune. They desperately spread the word: "The landlords and rich peasants have been eliminated," "There are no counter-revolutionaries anymore." They say, "Now everyone eats according to work points, so why distinguish classes?" Behind the scenes, however, they gather a group of bad elements, plotting to seize power. As early as 1964, they established a black branch to usurp the Party, government, financial, and cultural power of the village. The "Four Cleanups" movement of last year exposed and smashed their evil plots. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they again attempted to fish in troubled waters, emerging from the black hole, and colluding with the "four unclean" cadres who had been removed from their posts, carrying out a campaign to reverse verdicts. They shouted, "The 'Four Cleanups' were wrong, they were a mess!" They shouted that they wanted to "rebel"! They spread malicious rumors and shot poisonous arrows, viciously attacking genuine revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses. Under the banner of "revolutionary rebellion," they struggled against more than 80% of the brigade and team cadres. They installed the "four unclean" cadres who had been removed from their posts and some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements into the Cultural Revolution organizations and production leadership teams, usurping the power of the village. Later, with the help and support of the comrades in the People's Liberation Army, we revolutionary factions united with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, thoroughly repelled the enemy's attack, and reclaimed all the power they had seized.

The matter is clear. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party crazily advocates the theory of "class struggle extinguished" precisely to allow the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and all the ghosts and monsters to come out and cause trouble, to seize our power as poor and lower-middle peasants. If we do not recognize this, then as our great leader Chairman Mao says: "It will not take much time, in a few years or a decade, or at most a few decades, it will inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." As a result, we poor and lower-middle peasants and the working people of the whole country will return to the dark old society and live a life worse than cattle and horses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the more they shout at the top of their lungs about the theory of "class struggle extinguished," the more they want us to abandon proletarian dictatorship, the more we must wage class struggle and strengthen proletarian dictatorship. The proletarian dictatorship is won by the revolutionary forerunners through unremitting struggle, with their blood and lives. The proletarian dictatorship is the lifeline of the working people. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class bitterness, and always remember class hatred. We must arm our minds with Chairman Mao's thoughts on class and class struggle, and on proletarian dictatorship, use the perspective of class struggle to observe and analyze everything. Firmly grasp the powerful weapon of proletarian dictatorship, and defend our socialist homeland to the death, so that it will never change color for thousands of years.

    无产阶级政权是劳动人民的命根子
    河北省临西县东留善固大队党支部书记、民兵指导员　吕玉兰
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派极力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论。胡说什么“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本结束了”、“我国社会主义和资本主义谁胜谁负的问题现在已经解决”等等。这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。
    阶级斗争并没有熄灭。建国十几年来，两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，从来没有停止过。就拿我们村的情况来说，这些年来，被推翻的地主、富农，与村里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派互相勾结，千方百计地挖社会主义墙脚，时时刻刻妄图复辟资本主义。毛主席早就号召我们“组织起来”，我们贫下中农积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，办起了农业合作社，这一伙坏家伙就带头闹退社，闹单干。一九五八年，毛主席说：人民公社好！我们按照毛主席指引的方向，办起了人民公社，又是这伙坏家伙，趁国内三年困难时期，大肆叫嚷分田单干，包产到户，牲口户养，妄图搞垮人民公社集体经济。在无产阶级文化大革命中，还是这伙坏家伙，以为“翻天”的时候到了，就和下台的“四不清”干部勾结一起，进行阶级报复，破坏文化大革命。这些活生生的事实，彻底粉碎了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反动谬论。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在他的大毒草《修养》里，只字不提无产阶级专政，却大喊“阶级斗争熄灭”了，目的就是为了麻痹革命人民的斗争意志，妄图使我们放弃阶级斗争，放弃无产阶级专政，以达到他们篡夺无产阶级政权的目的。在我们村，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派唱的就是这个调子。他们拚命散布：“地主、富农消灭了”，“反革命也没有了”。说什么“现在都是凭工分吃饭，还分什么阶级？”背地里却拉拢一伙坏家伙，阴谋大搞夺权活动。早在一九六四年，他们就成立了篡夺村里的党、政、财、文大权的黑支部。去年的“四清”运动，揭露和粉碎了他们的罪恶阴谋。这次无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们又想混水摸鱼，从黑洞里钻了出来，和下了台的“四不清”干部勾结在一起，大搞翻案活动。叫嚣什么“四清搞错了，搞糟了！”叫嚷要起来“造反”！他们大煽阴风，大放毒箭，恶毒地攻击真正的革命干部和革命群众。他们打着“革命造反”的旗号，把百分之八十以上的大队、小队干部都斗争了。他们把下台的“四不清”干部和一些地、富、反、坏分子安插到文革组织和生产领导班子里去，篡夺了村里的大权。后来，在解放军同志的帮助和支持下，我们革命派团结广大贫下中农，彻底打退了阶级敌人的进攻，夺回了被他们夺去的一切权力。
    事情很明显，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所以要疯狂地宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是为了让地、富、反、坏，牛鬼蛇神一起跑出来翻天，专我们贫下中农的政。我们如果认识不到这一点，就会象我们伟大领袖毛主席说的：“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”结果，我们贫下中农和全国劳动人民就会重新回到黑暗的旧社会，重新过牛马不如的生活。
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，越是声嘶力竭地宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，要我们放弃无产阶级专政，我们就越要搞阶级斗争，越要加强无产阶级专政。无产阶级的政权，是革命先烈经过前赴后继的斗争，用鲜血和生命换来的。无产阶级政权是劳动人民的命根子。我们一定牢记毛主席教导，永远不忘阶级苦，永远牢记阶级仇。用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的思想，关于无产阶级专政的思想武装自己的头脑，用阶级斗争的观点观察一切，分析一切。牢牢掌握无产阶级专政这个无比强大的武器，誓死保卫我们的社会主义江山，使它千秋万代永不变色。
