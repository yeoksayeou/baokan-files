In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the entire Chinese people and revolutionary people of the world solemnly commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's great work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," another brilliant document by our dearest and most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, "On the Question of the Study of the 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" has been published. Chairman Mao's letter is another beacon guiding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a powerful weapon on the ideological and cultural front of the socialist revolution!

Chairman Mao clearly points out: "Regarding the bourgeois academic authorities, we should criticize their poisonous ideas that harm the youth, and we should not surrender to them."

The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is criticism and revolution. For 17 years, under the protection and support of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, the bourgeoisie has never stopped creating counter-revolutionary public opinion to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat in the ideological and cultural realm. "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without clearing away, there can be no progress; without stopping, there can be no advance." "Destruction means criticism, means revolution." Chairman Mao's letter seriously criticizes some "big figures" within the Party who suppress the new forces from firing at the bourgeois academic "authorities." "They form a united front with bourgeois writers on idealism and are willing to be captives of the bourgeoisie." Should we protect these demons and monsters and let them increasingly attack the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism, or should we thoroughly criticize them, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carry the socialist revolution through to the end? Around this issue, the proletarian revolutionary faction led by Chairman Mao and a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have engaged in one serious struggle after another.

Now, we clearly see that the biggest of these "big figures," the ultimate backer of these "big figures," is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, China's Khrushchev. It was he who praised the treacherous film "The Last Days of the Dynasty" as "patriotic," stifling a major struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the ideological and cultural front; it was he who advocated only unity with the bourgeoisie and not struggle, surrendering to the bourgeoisie, supporting the capitalist-roaders within the literary and artistic circles to "block the very lively critical articles by 'small figures,'" suppressing the struggle "against the poisoning of the youth for more than 30 years by the bourgeois idealism of the Hu Shi clique in the classical literature field"...

Today, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary faction has already exposed this biggest capitalist-roader within the Party! We must press on and thoroughly settle his heinous crimes!

Chairman Mao's letter speaks the heart of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Our great leader, Chairman Mao, has always been the greatest supporter of revolutionary new things. In this letter, he enthusiastically praises the "small figures" who represent new things. The rain of Mao Zedong Thought nourishes our growth. "The vitality of the nine provinces relies on wind and thunder." The revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary faction relies on the great Mao Zedong Thought. Toward the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," toward a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, toward the ideology of the exploiting classes, we must raise the revolutionary banner of rebellion, overthrow them, and rebel against them! We must always maintain the revolutionary spirit of rebellion of the proletariat, bravely fight against all anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought revisionists, and always be the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!
Long live, long, long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    永做文化大革命的尖兵
    北京师范大学井冈山公社中文系联合大队
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，正当全中国、全世界革命人民隆重纪念毛主席的伟大著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的又一光辉文献《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》发表了。毛主席的这封信，是无产阶级文化大革命又一盏指路明灯，是思想文化战线上社会主义革命的又一个强大武器！
    毛主席明确指出：对资产阶级反动学术权威，“应当批判他们的毒害青年的错误思想，不应当对他们投降。”
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质是批判的，革命的。十七年来，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的包庇和支持下，资产阶级在思想文化领域内一刻也没有停止过制造颠覆无产阶级专政的反革命舆论。“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”，“破，就是批判，就是革命。”毛主席的这封信严肃地批判了党内的一些“大人物”，他们压制新生力量向资产阶级学术“权威”开火，“他们同资产阶级作家在唯心论方面讲统一战线，甘心作资产阶级的俘虏”。是保护这批牛鬼蛇神，让他们日甚一日地攻击无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，还是对他们进行彻底批判，捍卫无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底？围绕这个问题，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了一次又一次的严重的斗争。
    现在，我们十分清楚地看出，这些“大人物”中的最大的家伙，这些“大人物”的总后台，就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。是他赞扬卖国主义的影片《清宫秘史》是“爱国主义”的，扼杀了无产阶级同资产阶级在思想文化战线上的一场重大斗争；是他主张对资产阶级只讲联合，不讲斗争，向资产阶级投降，支持文艺界党内走资本主义道路当权派“阻拦‘小人物’的很有生气的批判文章”，压制“反对在古典文学领域毒害青年三十余年的胡适派资产阶级唯心论的斗争”……今天，在毛泽东思想的指引下，无产阶级革命派已经把这个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了！我们一定要乘胜追击，彻底清算他的滔天罪行！
    毛主席的这封信，说出了无产阶级革命派的心里话。我们伟大的领袖毛主席，从来就是以最大的热情支持革命的新生事物的。他在这封信里满腔热忱地赞扬了代表新生事物的“小人物”。毛泽东思想的雨露滋润我们成长。“九州生气恃风雷”。无产阶级革命派的革命生气，就靠伟大的毛泽东思想。对于资产阶级反动学术“权威”，对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对于剥削阶级思想，就是要高举革命的造反大旗，革它的命，造它的反！我们必须永远保持无产阶级的革命造反精神，向一切反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子勇敢地开战，永远做无产阶级文化大革命的尖兵！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
