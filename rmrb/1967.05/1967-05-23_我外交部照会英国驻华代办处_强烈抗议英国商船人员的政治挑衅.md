	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a note to the British Charge d'Affaires in China, strongly protesting the political provocation by British merchant ship personnel.

	New China News Agency, May 22nd: During its stay at the Dalian port in China, the British ship "Laurence Graystone" had crew members, including Ekford and Twitchen, who insulted the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao on May 7th and 15th. They also wrote the reactionary slogan "Long Live America" on the ship. This extremely serious political provocation and hostile act against our country has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. The relevant authorities in China have, in accordance with the law, detained the perpetrators and announced that the ship's captain, Marsden, who condoned this incident, will not be allowed to enter Chinese ports in the future.

	The above-mentioned political provocation by the British ship personnel is inseparable from the British government's consistent hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has, on May 19th, sent a note to the British Charge d'Affaires in China, lodging a strong protest.

    强烈抗议英国商船人员的政治挑衅
    新华社二十二日讯　英国“劳得·格拉斯通”号商船在停泊我大连海港期间，这艘商船的船员爱克弗德和特威琴等曾于五月七日、十五日两次侮辱我国人民伟大领袖毛主席的像。并在船上写“美国万岁”的反动标语。这种极其严重的政治挑衅和敌视我国的行为，激起了我国人民极大的愤慨。我国有关当局已依法扣留肇事船员，并宣布纵容该事件的船长马尔斯敦今后不准再来中国港口。
    英国船上人员的上述政治挑衅行为同英国政府一贯敌视中国人民的态度是分不开的。我国外交部已于五月十九日照会英国驻华代办处提出强烈的抗议。
