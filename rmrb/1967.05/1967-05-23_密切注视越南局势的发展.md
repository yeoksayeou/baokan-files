	Closely Watch the Development of the Situation in Vietnam

	In recent days, U.S. imperialism has frantically intensified its military adventures in Vietnam. While U.S. bandit planes have been continuously bombing and strafing the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, U.S. invading forces have brazenly launched a large-scale invasion into the demilitarized zone. This is an extremely serious step taken by the U.S. aggressors to escalate the war in Vietnam.

	The Chinese people strongly condemn this arrogant act of aggression by U.S. imperialism, resolutely support the just stand of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and closely watch the developments in the situation in Vietnam.

	Since the Guam conference, U.S. imperialism has taken a series of "escalation" actions in the Vietnam War. U.S. newspapers have revealed that the Johnson administration has decided to expand the ground war beyond South Vietnam. The current large-scale invasion of the demilitarized zone by U.S. invading forces is a dangerous signal of U.S. imperialism's invasion of North Vietnam and the spread of the war of aggression to the entire Indochina.

	The U.S. State Department spokesman shamelessly declared that the U.S. invading forces' invasion of the demilitarized zone is a "purely defensive measure" and a "legitimate right" of the United States. This is sheer bandit logic. You have sent hundreds of thousands of invading troops to invade Vietnamese territory, waged a war of aggression for several years, and gradually expanded this war. Can this be called "defense"? You have long since completely torn up the Geneva Agreement and broken the 17th parallel boundary, and now you brazenly invade the demilitarized zone. Can this be called a "legitimate right"? This set of shameless sophistry cannot cover up your crime of escalating the Vietnam War, nor can it make you escape the severe punishment of the 31 million Vietnamese people!

	The Soviet revisionist leadership clique has once again played the shameful role of accomplice in U.S. imperialism's criminal activities of escalating the war of aggression. Not long ago, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique convened the European New Labor Traitor Conference, pushing for "European détente" and urging the United States to transfer troops from Europe to the Vietnam battlefield. Just as the U.S. invading forces were advancing into the demilitarized zone, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique colluded with the British Labor Party government, coordinating with the actions of the United States, attempting to stage another farce of U.S.-British-Soviet collusion to pressure Vietnam into "peace talks" as in this spring. The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is so eager to serve U.S. imperialism, fully exposing themselves as great traitors who betray the revolutionary struggle of the Vietnamese people.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces on the verge of extinction will make desperate struggles against the revolutionary forces." U.S. imperialism, with the support of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, is frantically escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam, which is a desperate struggle in its predicament. At present, the situation of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation is excellent. The U.S. invading forces' "dry season offensive" and "pacification plan" have suffered repeated defeats. The Johnson administration is in a state of internal and external difficulties, with no way out. The U.S. aggressors foolishly hope to find a way out through intensified military adventures, but this is merely a case of a cornered dog jumping over a wall.

	On the battlefield in South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors, who are confronting 14 million South Vietnamese people, have already been beaten to the point of losing their helmets and armor and suffering head injuries. If they dare to expand the ground war to North Vietnam and to the entire Indochina, then they will surely be smashed to pieces even faster under the iron fists of the 31 million Vietnamese people and the people of the Indochina countries.

	The Chinese people have always regarded supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation as their sacred internationalist duty. To support the Vietnamese comrades in thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors, the Chinese people are ready to make the greatest national sacrifices. The 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in accordance with the requirements of the Vietnamese government and people, are ready to take all necessary actions at any time. The Chinese people have always kept their word. No matter how high the level of war the U.S. imperialists escalate, no matter how wide the range of the war they expand, the Chinese people are determined to continue supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese people are not afraid of taking any risks, not afraid of paying any price, and will definitely make their own contribution to the thorough defeat of the U.S. aggressors together with the heroic Vietnamese people!

### 密切注视越南局势的发展

    密切注视越南局势的发展
    近来，美帝国主义疯狂地加紧了在越南的军事冒险。在美国强盗飞机连续对越南民主共和国首都河内狂轰滥炸的同时，侵越美军悍然大规模侵入非军事区。这是美国侵略者扩大侵越战争的极其严重的步骤。
    中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义这一猖狂的侵略罪行，坚决支持越南民主共和国政府的严正立场，并且密切注视着越南局势的发展。
    关岛黑会以后，美帝国主义在侵越战争中接连采取了一系列战争“升级”行动。美国报刊透露，约翰逊政府已经作出决定，要把地面战争扩大到越南南方以外的地区去。侵越美军现在大举侵入非军事区，就是美帝国主义入侵越南北方并把侵略战火烧到整个印度支那的一个危险的信号。
    美国国务院发言人公然叫嚷，美国侵略军侵入非军事区是“纯粹的防御性措施”，是美国的“合法权利”。这真是赤裸裸的强盗逻辑。你们派遣了几十万侵略军闯进越南的国土，打了几年的侵略战争，并且一步步地扩大了这场战争。难道这能叫做“防御”吗？你们早就彻底撕毁了日内瓦协议，打破了十七度线的界限，现在又悍然侵入非军事区。难道这能叫做“合法权利”吗？这一套无耻的诡辩，丝毫不能掩盖你们扩大侵越战争的罪行，也绝不能使你们逃脱三千一百万越南人民的严厉惩罚！
    苏修领导集团，在美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的罪恶活动中，又一次充当了可耻的帮凶。不久前，苏修领导集团纠集了欧洲新工贼会议，大搞“欧洲缓和”，怂恿美国把兵力从欧洲抽调到越南战场。正当侵越美军开进非军事区的时候，苏修领导集团又同英国工党政府合伙，配合美国的行动，妄想重演今年春节期间美、英、苏勾结压越“和谈”的丑剧。苏修领导集团这样卖力地为美帝国主义效劳，彻底地暴露了他们是出卖越南人民革命斗争的大叛徒。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义在苏修叛徒集团支持下疯狂扩大侵越战争，就是它在困境中的一种绝望挣扎。目前，越南人民抗美救国斗争的形势大好。美国侵略军的“旱季攻势”和“绥靖计划”连遭惨败。约翰逊政府内外交困，走投无路。美国侵略者妄想通过加紧军事冒险来寻求一条出路，不过是狗急跳墙。
    在越南南方战场上，美国侵略者同一千四百万南越人民较量，已经被打得丢盔弃甲，头破血流。如果它胆敢把地面战争扩大到越南北方，扩大到整个印度支那，那末，它在三千一百万越南人民和印度支那各国人民的铁拳痛击下，必将更快地遭到粉身碎骨的下场。
    中国人民一贯把支援越南人民的抗美救国斗争，当作自己神圣的国际主义义务。为了支援越南兄弟彻底打败美国侵略者，中国人民不惜作出最大的民族牺牲。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，根据越南政府和人民的要求，随时准备采取一切必要的行动。中国人民向来是说了话算数的。不论美帝国主义把战争升到那一级，把战火扩大到多大范围，中国人民都决心把支持越南人民抗美救国的斗争进行到底。中国人民决不怕承担任何风险，决不怕付出任何代价，一定要同英雄的越南人民一起，为彻底打败美国侵略者作出自己的贡献！
