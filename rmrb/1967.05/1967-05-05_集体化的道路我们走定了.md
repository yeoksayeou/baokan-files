Mao Zedong, our great leader, has taught us: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary."

The number one power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road, during the period when our country's economy faced temporary difficulties, conspired with international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, as well as domestic landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, to spread the poisonous wind of capitalism and revisionism. They attempted to restore capitalism in our country. He is a thorough counter-revolutionary.

From 1959 to 1961, our brigade suffered severe natural disasters, making our economy quite difficult. At this time, a small clique within the Party who took the capitalist road, along with the ghosts and snakes in society, colluded with each other. On one hand, they created public opinion, openly spreading the idea that "collectivism is not as good as individual farming"; on the other hand, they held secret meetings behind our backs, planning to distribute the brigade's over 400 mu of forest and fields to individual households, and even preparing to distribute farmland.

We poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's instructions on taking the path of collectivization, clarified our direction, and solidified our stance. We engaged in a head-on struggle with this small clique of bad elements. They spread the idea of "individual farming is good," so we spread the idea of "collectivization is good." We poor and lower-middle peasants vigorously propagated: Only by relying on the collective, only by taking the socialist road, can we overcome temporary difficulties, and only then can the broad masses of peasants become prosperous and fundamentally change the rural landscape. Everyone expressed: "Even if our heads are smashed, we will not allow the forest and fields to be distributed to individual households!" No matter how they stirred up trouble, we poor and lower-middle peasants still managed the forest and fields collectively.

Not long after, just as we were fighting against the small clique of bad elements within the brigade and achieving initial victory, a new wind of "three autonomies and one contract" blew in. A small clique within the commune who took the capitalist road openly proposed "contracting production to households," using the name of the "higher Party committee" to force us to execute it, demanding that we distribute part of the land to individual households. At that time, we angrily expressed our opposition to this practice, but they used various means to suppress us, and some bad elements within the brigade also mocked us with cold words.

In this sharp struggle between socialism and capitalism, it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that armed us, and it was our great leader Mao Zedong who supported us and made the decision. At the most intense moment of the struggle, we recalled Chairman Mao's teachings, remembered that collectivization and communization were the bright path shown to us by Chairman Mao, and we were filled with confidence, devoting all our energy to collective production. Soon, Chairman Mao issued the great call to further consolidate the collective economy and develop agricultural production. We poor and lower-middle peasants were overjoyed. We actively propagated Chairman Mao's great call, mobilized the broad masses of commune members to work hard on collective production, and further consolidated and developed the collective economy.

This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution finally exposed the number one power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road, thoroughly revealing his counter-revolutionary ugly face. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. We poor and lower-middle peasants, from our own personal experiences, understand that the number one power-holder within the Party who takes the capitalist road is the chief of revisionism and capitalism in our country, and he is our mortal enemy. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight him down, fight him to the ground, and fight him to stink, thoroughly purging his poison!

    集体化的道路我们走定了
    河南省原阳县原武公社白塔大队党支部书记　薛宗理
    毛主席教导我们说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。”
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在我国经济遭到暂时困难的时期，同国际上的帝、修、反和国内的地、富、反、坏、右，一个鼻孔出气，大刮资本主义、修正主义的阴风，妄想在我国复辟资本主义。他是一个地地道道的反革命派。
    一九五九年到一九六一年，我们大队连续遭受严重的自然灾害，经济比较困难。这时候，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，互相勾结。他们一方面大造舆论，公开散布“集体不如单干”；一方面背着我们开黑会，要把队里四百多亩林田分给各户，甚至还准备分农田。
    我们贫下中农学习了毛主席关于走集体化道路的指示，明确了方向，坚定了立场。我们和这一小撮坏家伙进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们造“单干好”的舆论，我们就造“集体化好”的舆论。我们贫下中农大力宣传：只有依靠集体，只有走社会主义道路，才能克服暂时的困难，才能使广大农民共同富裕起来，彻底改变农村面貌。大家表示：“打烂头也不能把林田分给各户！”不管他们怎样闹，我们贫下中农仍然对林田实行集体管理。
    事隔不久，就在我们同队里一小撮坏家伙进行斗争，并取得初步胜利的时候，又刮来了一股“三自一包”的妖风。公社里一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，公然提出“包工包产到户”，以“上级党委”的名义，强迫我们执行，要我们把一部分土地分到各户。当时，我们气愤地表示反对这种做法，他们就用各种手段，千方百计地压我们，队里的一些坏家伙也冷言冷语地讽刺我们。
    在这场社会主义和资本主义两条道路的尖锐斗争中，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了我们，是我们伟大领袖毛主席给我们撑了腰，作了主。在斗争最激烈的时候，我们想起了毛主席的教导，想起集体化、公社化是毛主席给我们指出的光明大道，我们就信心百倍，把全部精力用到集体生产上。不久，毛主席发出了进一步巩固集体经济、发展农业生产的伟大号召。我们贫下中农可乐坏了。我们积极宣传毛主席的伟大号召，发动广大社员努力搞好集体生产，使集体经济进一步巩固和发展。
    这次无产阶级文化大革命，终于把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来，彻底揭露了他的反革命的丑恶面目。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我们贫下中农从自己的亲身经历中体会到：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是修正主义、资本主义在我国的总头目，就是我们贫下中农的死对头。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把这个反革命修正主义总头目斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，彻底肃清他的流毒！
