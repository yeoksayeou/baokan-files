Just as the revolutionary masses across the nation rise up to denounce the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, we are commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." We feel particularly close to it, and it has further strengthened our fighting spirit.

Since the May Fourth New Culture Movement, especially since the establishment of the League of Left-Wing Writers, there has been a struggle between two lines within the new literary movement. Led by Lu Xun, revolutionary literary workers, in their struggle against the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang, had put forward many correct propositions. For example, Lu Xun was very concerned about the revolutionization of the writers, pointing out that writers must first become revolutionaries, "must share life with the revolution," and "deeply feel the pulse of the revolution." He lamented the lack of proletarian writers at the time and called for the creation of a large number of new fighters. Regarding the literary heritage of ancient times, he believed it must be critically inherited. Regarding the relationship between literary work and the entire revolutionary movement, he clearly pointed out that the former is a "wing" of the latter. Therefore, he repeatedly referred to his creative activities as "command literature." By 1936, he further proposed the slogan of "national revolutionary war mass literature," directly serving Mao Zedong's advocacy of establishing a united anti-Japanese national united front for this political goal. Although Lu Xun also proposed the slogan of literature serving the workers and peasants and the workers and peasants creating their own literature, he did not systematically solve the fundamental problem of literature integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

It was our great leader Chairman Mao who, in his "Talks," first completely, thoroughly, and correctly solved this problem. Chairman Mao's brilliant work creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, marking an epoch-making important document. It not only scientifically summarized the basic experience of the revolutionary literary movement in China since the May Fourth Movement but also scientifically summarized the basic experience of the international proletarian revolutionary literary movement. This is the first time in the history of proletarian revolution to propose the most complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist literary line.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to drag China backward and to restore capitalism in China, vehemently opposed Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist literary line, claiming that "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is about the direction of New Democracy, and now it is socialism, he thinks that "using the perspective of New Democratic culture to view today is not enough," and so on. This is extremely malicious. Through his lackeys Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, he promoted a revisionist black line in the literary field, advocating "literature for all the people," actually promoting capitalist, feudal, and revisionist literature.

Twenty-five years ago, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in his brilliant "Talks": "As Lu Xun criticized, people like Liang Jiahua, although they advocate in words that literature is super-class, in reality, they advocate bourgeois literature." Liang Jiahua, this running dog of the bourgeoisie, once shouted loudly the fallacy of "exploitation is not a crime." The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Liang Jiahua are singing the same tune. He shamelessly sings the tune of "the more exploitation, the greater the merit, the more glorious," and directs his lackeys to promote revisionist literature, openly spreading the black goods of summoning capitalism in socialist New China. The release of films like "Lin's Shop" and "City of No Night" are prominent examples.

Chairman Mao taught revolutionary literary workers in the "Talks": "We cannot love the enemy, cannot love the ugly phenomena of society, our goal is to eliminate these things." The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party openly sings the opposite tune of Chairman Mao, going even further than the likes of Liang Jiahua. Like a fly attracted to filth, he even more frantically praises the bourgeoisie, singing praises for the exploitative system of man eating man, advocating bourgeois literature, and creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in China.

The arrogant activities of the class enemies make us proletarians and laboring people see even more clearly that Chairman Mao's great book, not only has not "become outdated," but has even more practical significance. Its entire thought shines even more brilliantly, guiding us forward for a long period. We must study this brilliant work even more diligently, propagate Mao Zedong's literary thought even more enthusiastically, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line even more resolutely and bravely.

Before the publication of the "Talks," there was a struggle between two lines within the new literary movement. In the 25 years since the publication of the "Talks," especially in the 17 years since the founding of the nation, the struggle between the two lines on the literary front has been going on intensely. One red line, that is, Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, has led the literary movement in our country to the correct direction of development. Those who stand on this revolutionary line are the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, who insist on the correct direction of literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, and have waged unyielding struggles against the revisionist literary line. In this regard, Comrade Jiang Qing is an outstanding representative. One black line is the revisionist literary line under the control of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. A small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and a group of demons and ghosts have tried every means to turn literature into a tool for the restoration of capitalism. The revolutionary literary line has always grown in the midst of intense struggles with the reactionary literary line. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line has achieved great victories, and the revisionist literary line has been reduced to a state of utter collapse.

Twenty-five years ago, Chairman Mao called in the "Talks" for revolutionary literary workers to "thoroughly destroy" all feudal, bourgeois, and non-proletarian things. We must hold high the great red flag of the "Talks," carry forward the spirit of Lu Xun's beating of fallen dogs, continue to fight, and pursue victory, thoroughly smash the revisionist literary black line, and shatter the plots and tricks of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party using literature to restore capitalism, let the glorious banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever fly high on our literary front!

    让毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬
    许广平
    正当全国革命群众奋起讨伐党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的时候，纪念伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，我们觉得格外亲切，更增强了战斗的力量。
    自从“五四”新文化运动，特别是左翼作家联盟成立以来，新文学运动内部一直存在着两条路线的斗争。以鲁迅为首的革命文艺工作者，在和以周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线进行斗争的时候，曾经提出过许多正确的主张。比如，鲁迅很关心作家队伍的革命化，指出作家首先要成为一个革命家，“必须和革命共同着生命”，“深切地感受着革命的脉搏”；他曾经慨叹当时没有工农作家，大声疾呼号召要造就大群新战士；对于古代的文学遗产，他认为必须是批判地接受；关于文艺工作和整个革命运动的关系，他明确指出前者是后者的“一翼”。所以他一再把自己的创作活动，称之为听取将令的“遵命文学”。到了一九三六年，他更进一步提出“民族革命战争的大众文学”这个口号，直接为毛主席主张的建立抗日民族统一战线这个政治目标服务。鲁迅虽然也提出了文艺要为工农服务和工农自己创作文艺的口号，但是，他并没有系统地解决文艺同工农兵相结合这个根本问题。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在他的《讲话》中，才第一次最完整、最彻底、最正确地解决了这个问题。毛主席的这部光辉著作，天才地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，是一部划时代的重要文献。它不但对我国“五四”以来的革命文艺运动的基本经验作了科学的总结，也对国际无产阶级革命文艺运动的基本经验作了科学的总结。这是无产阶级革命历史上第一次提出的最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，为了把中国拉向倒退，为了使资本主义在中国复辟，竭力反对毛主席的马克思列宁主义文艺路线，胡说什么：《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》讲的方向，是新民主主义的，而现在是社会主义的，他认为“仍用新民主主义文化的观点看今天，就不够了”，等等。真是恶毒之极。他通过他的娄罗周扬、夏衍之流，在文艺界推行了一条修正主义文艺黑线，鼓吹什么“全民文艺”，实际上是大搞资本主义、封建主义、修正主义的文艺。
    二十五年前，毛主席在他的这篇光辉《讲话》中，早就明确地指出：“象鲁迅所批评的梁实秋一类人，他们虽然在口头上提出什么文艺是超阶级的，但是他们在实际上是主张资产阶级的文艺”。梁实秋这条资产阶级的乏走狗，曾经声嘶力竭地宣扬过“剥削无罪”的谬论。中国的赫鲁晓夫与梁实秋之流唱的是一个调子。他无耻地大弹“剥削有功”的滥调，说什么“剥削得越多，功劳越大，就越光荣”，而且指使他的娄罗，大搞修正主义的文艺，在社会主义的新中国里，明目张胆地散播为资本主义招魂的黑货。美化资产阶级的影片《林家铺子》、《不夜城》等等的出笼，就是突出的例子。
    毛主席在《讲话》中教导革命的文艺工作者：“我们不能爱敌人，不能爱社会的丑恶现象，我们的目的是消灭这些东西。”党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，公然和毛主席大唱反调，比梁实秋之流走得更远。他象苍蝇逐臭一样，更加疯狂地吹捧资产阶级，为人吃人的剥削制度大唱颂歌，提倡资产阶级文艺，为资本主义在中国复辟制造舆论。
    阶级敌人的这些猖狂活动，使我们无产阶级和劳动人民更加清楚地看到，毛主席的这部宝书，非但没有“过时”，而且更有现实意义，它的全部思想，更加光彩夺目地为我们指明了前进的方向，够我们无产阶级用上一个长时期了。我们必须更加努力地学习这篇光辉著作，更加热情地宣传毛泽东文艺思想，更加坚决地执行和更加勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线。
    《讲话》发表以前，新文学运动内部存在着两条路线的斗争。《讲话》发表以后的二十五年来，特别是建国十七年以来，文艺战线上的两条路线的斗争，一直激烈地进行着。一条红线，即毛主席的革命文艺路线，它把我国的文艺运动引向正确的发展方向。站在这条革命路线方面的，是广大无产阶级革命派的文艺战士，他们坚持毛主席文艺为工农兵服务、文艺为无产阶级政治服务的正确方向，并对修正主义文艺路线进行了不屈不挠的斗争。在这方面，江青同志就是杰出代表。一条黑线，就是在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派控制下的修正主义文艺路线，一小撮反革命修正主义分子和一批牛鬼蛇神，千方百计地要把文艺变成复辟资本主义的工具。革命的文艺路线从来都是在和反动的文艺路线激烈斗争中成长起来的。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命当中，毛主席的革命文艺路线已经取得了伟大的胜利，修正主义文艺路线已经到了土崩瓦解的惨败境地。
    二十五年前，毛主席在《讲话》中，早就号召革命的文艺家，对于那些封建的、资产阶级以及各种非无产阶级的东西，“应该彻底地破坏它们”。我们必须高举《讲话》这面伟大红旗，发扬鲁迅痛打落水狗的精神，再接再厉，乘胜追击，彻底摧毁修正主义文艺黑线，粉碎党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派利用文艺来复辟资本主义的阴谋诡计，让毛泽东思想的光辉旗帜，在我们的文艺阵地上高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
