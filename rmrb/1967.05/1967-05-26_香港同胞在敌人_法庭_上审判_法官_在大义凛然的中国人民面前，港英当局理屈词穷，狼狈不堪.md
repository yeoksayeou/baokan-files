Hong Kong compatriots, who were unlawfully arrested during the British authorities' "May 22" bloody massacre, engaged in a head-on struggle with the enemy in the British authorities' "court" on May 24. Their dauntless heroism greatly bolstered the morale of the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, completely overwhelming the arrogance of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

Fearful that their crimes would be exposed, the British authorities in Hong Kong refused to allow Hong Kong Chinese compatriots to enter the "court" to observe the proceedings on May 24. The 98 compatriots who appeared at the "Central Magistracy" had all suffered severe beatings; those with serious injuries had to be supported by their comrades, their shirts soaked with blood, and their wounds still bleeding. Some were barefoot, others wore only one shoe. They entered the "court" with heads held high, showing extreme contempt and hatred for the fascist "court" of the British authorities. The "judges" enforcing fascist laws did not allow these seriously injured male and female compatriots to sit down, subjecting them to hours of torture and abuse. The arrested Hong Kong compatriots stood tall and defiantly accused the judge: "We are not criminals, we do not admit any 'crime'! We must be released immediately!"

De Zhen, an employee of the Chinese trade organization Dexin Row in Hong Kong, bravely fought back against the enemy in the "court." He exposed the crimes of British imperialism and defended the dignity of the Chinese people. De Zhen had been severely beaten by six or seven Hong Kong police officers, and when he appeared in the enemy's "court," his body was covered in blood. The brutal persecution had inflicted physical wounds on him, but it could not break his resolute spirit. He stood fearlessly before the enemy's "judge" and the many lackeys in the "court," answering the enemy's provocative "interrogation" with a firm and powerful voice.

The "judge" asked De Zhen if he admitted his "crime," to which De Zhen replied without hesitation: "I am not guilty. The guilty ones are the British authorities in Hong Kong!" He angrily declared: "I want to accuse the British authorities in Hong Kong of their bloody suppression of our Hong Kong compatriots, and their arrogant and unreasonable provocations!" De Zhen questioned the "judge": "Why don't you dare hold a public trial? What is the meaning of this secret trial?"

The "judge" stupidly asked De Zhen if he had any witnesses, to which De Zhen firmly replied: "All the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are witnesses to your atrocities, all those unlawfully detained and persecuted by you are witnesses to your atrocities! Our 700 million compatriots in the motherland are witnesses to your crimes!" The "judge" was stammering and flustered, but he still sentenced De Zhen to nine months in prison.

A female compatriot, Huang Zhen, who was severely injured by beatings, was unlawfully sentenced to three months in prison. She had been brutally beaten by Hong Kong police, her head injured, and her white shirt turned into a bloodstained garment. Due to excessive bleeding, her face was pale. However, she remained unyielding and in the "court" denounced the atrocities of the Hong Kong police officer "3040" who had beaten her without reason. She said that on that day, everyone went to protest in an orderly manner, but the premeditated "riot squad" charged into the crowd and started beating and dragging people indiscriminately. That "3040" thug broke her head with a baton; she was covered in blood and fell to the ground. That thug then stomped on her with his boots and beat her mercilessly with his baton. Her waist was bruised black, and her body was covered in wounds.

Li Jinping, another female compatriot who was unlawfully sentenced to three months in prison, was also covered in wounds. She bravely accused the Hong Kong police of unlawfully detaining her and beating her with a baton on her back in the police car, despite the harassment of a traitorous Chinese "translator."

Another female compatriot, Liang Yanfang, who was unlawfully sentenced to one month in prison, was only 18 years old. She fought bravely in the "court," and even the "judge" had to admit that this young female compatriot was very stubborn.

In the face of our heroic and unyielding patriotic compatriots, the British "judges" revealed their true colors as paper tigers, having no means to retaliate. Some traitorous Hong Kong police resorted to despicable methods of spreading rumors, slandering, and defaming, attempting to make our patriotic compatriots admit their "crimes." These traitors told our compatriots, "The Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po no longer support you, even the mainland does not support you." "In the future, all reporters from Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po will be arrested," "If you admit your crimes now and just say you were passing by, did not shout slogans, and did not sing revolutionary songs, the court might give you a lighter sentence." These lies were all vehemently refuted by our compatriots.

    香港同胞在敌人“法庭”上审判“法官”
    在大义凛然的中国人民面前，港英当局理屈词穷，狼狈不堪
    新华社香港二十五日电　在香港英国当局“五·二二”血腥暴行中被无理逮捕的香港爱国同胞，二十四日在港英当局的“法庭”上同敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们大义凛然的英雄气概，大长了用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民的志气，完全压倒了港英当局的凶焰。
    港英当局害怕它的罪行公诸于世，二十四日竟拒绝香港中国同胞到“法庭”内旁听。当天出现在“中央裁判署”的九十八位同胞，没有一个不遭受过严刑拷打；伤势重的同胞还要由战友搀扶着，身上的衬衣全是血迹，伤口的血水还在流。有些同胞赤着双脚，有的只穿一只鞋。他们昂首进入“法庭”，对港英当局的法西斯“法庭”表现了极端的蔑视和仇视。执行法西斯法律的“法官”，竟不准这些身受重伤的男女同胞坐下，对他们进行了数小时的虐待与折磨。被捕的香港同胞昂首挺胸理直气壮地指责法官：“我们不是犯人，我们不认‘罪’！必须立即释放我们！”
    我驻港贸易机构德信行职工沈立忠在敌人的“法庭”上，坚决勇敢地进行了斗争。他揭露了港英帝国主义的罪行，维护了中国人民的尊严。沈立忠曾经受到六、七个港英警察的毒打，他出现在敌人的“法庭”上时，满身都是血迹。敌人的残酷迫害给他造成了肉体上的创伤，却无法挫折他的坚强的斗志。他面对着敌人的“法官”和“法庭”内的许多鹰犬，无所畏惧，挺胸而立，坚决有力地回答了敌人挑衅性的“讯问”。
    “法官”问沈立忠认不认“罪”，沈立忠毫不含糊地回答他：“我没有罪。有罪的是港英当局！”他愤怒地说：“我要控诉港英当局对我们香港同胞的血腥镇压，控诉港英当局这种蛮横无理的挑衅！”沈立忠质问这个“法官”：“你们为甚么不敢举行公开审讯？你们这样秘密审讯是甚么意思？”
    “法官”愚蠢地问沈立忠有没有证人，沈立忠坚定地说：“全香港的爱国同胞都是你们的暴行的证人，所有被你们无理拘捕和迫害的同胞都是你们的暴行的证人！我们祖国七亿同胞都是你们犯下的罪行的证人！”这个“法官”被沈立忠驳得支支吾吾，狼狈不堪，但他仍然把沈立忠“判处”入狱九个月。
    一位被毒打得身受重伤的女同胞黄珍，被非法判处入狱三个月。她曾遭到港英警察的恶毒殴打，头部被打穿，她的整件白衬衫变成了血衣，因流血过多而面呈青白色。但是她坚强不屈，在“法庭”上怒斥港英鹰犬“三零四零号”警员无理毒打她的暴行。她说，当天大家前往抗议时十分有秩序，而有预谋的“防暴队”在一声令下，冲进群众队伍中乱打乱拉。那名“三零四零号”暴徒用警棍打破了她的头；她血流披面，跌倒地上。那个暴徒又野兽般地用皮靴在她身上践踏，用警棍对她猛打猛撞。她腰部被打得瘀黑，身上伤痕累累。
    被非法判处入狱三月的女同胞李锦屏，身上也是伤痕累累。她不顾那名为虎作伥的华籍“翻译员”的刁难，理直气壮地指斥港英警察非法拘捕她，在警车上又用警棍在她背部进行毒打。
    另一位被非法判处入狱一月的女同胞梁燕芳，今年才十八岁，她在“法庭”上进行了坚强不屈的斗争，连“法官”也不得不承认这位年轻女同胞十分倔强。
    在英勇不屈的我爱国同胞面前，港英“法官”纸老虎原形毕露，毫无办法。有些甘当民族败类的港英警察又用尽造谣、中伤、污蔑等卑鄙手法，妄图使我爱国同胞低头认罪。这些民族败类对我同胞说，“《大公报》、《文汇报》已不支持你们了，连（中国）大陆也不支持你们了。”“将来大公、文汇报的记者全部都要抓起来”，“你们现在认罪，只要说你们是路过的，没有呼口号、没有唱革命歌曲，法庭也许可以给你们轻判”。这些谰言都遭到我同胞的痛斥。
