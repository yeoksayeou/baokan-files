	All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised. This is the basic task of revolutionary artists.

	Condemn the Cringing and Fawning of Revisionist Elements

	Worker at Beijing Motorcycle Manufacturing Plant, Cháng Liánchéng

	On the joyous occasion of the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the brilliant document "On the Question of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" was published. With hearts filled with immense excitement, we study it over and over again, and the more we study, the more we understand the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion, and one must first do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this."

	Soon after national liberation, some people enthusiastically promoted feudal culture and the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which advocated class capitulationism. This was not accidental. This was precisely the counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support and encouragement of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, creating counter-revolutionary restoration public opinion, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore their lost paradise.

	Wu Xun's thoughts are the thoughts of China's Khrushchev.

	After national liberation, China's Khrushchev went to Tianjin several times, flirting with the big capitalist Song Qicheng, seeking exploitation, and suppressing the workers' revolution. Isn't this just like Wu Xun kneeling before the landlord to beg for money?

	Wu Xun, under the banner of "educating the people," and China's Khrushchev, under the guise of "developing national industries." They are both surrendering to the exploiting classes and willingly becoming slaves of the exploiting classes. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party is doing this to abolish class struggle, abolish proletarian dictatorship, and attempt to push the laboring people, who have just been liberated, back into the fire pit, making them live lives worse than cattle and horses.

	Chairman Mao timely issued the great call of "On the Question of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'."

	This was the first clash between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the ideological and cultural realm after national liberation. The proletarian revolutionary faction, with Chairman Mao at the helm, wanted to use literature and art as a weapon to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and advance the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists wanted to use literature and art to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, poison people's minds, and achieve capitalist restoration.

	The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shattered the illusions of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line achieved great victory.

	"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength, and one should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We workers firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," greatly encourage revolutionary rebel spirit, and thoroughly criticize the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party. We will firmly grasp the Party, government, economy, and cultural power in the hands of the proletariat, making our country stride forward on the great road to socialism and communism.

    一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。
    痛斥修正主义分子的奴颜媚骨
    北京摩托车制造厂工人　常连成
    在纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的喜庆日子里，又发表了毛主席的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的光辉文献。我们怀着万分激动的心情，左一遍右一遍地学，越学越体会到毛主席的“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”这一教导的伟大意义。
    在全国解放不久，有人狂热地宣传封建文化，宣传阶级投降主义的电影《武训传》，这决不是偶然的。这正是那些反革命修正主义分子，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持和鼓励下，制造反革命复辟舆论，企图推翻无产阶级政权，恢复他们失去的天堂的一次进攻。
    武训的思想，就是中国赫鲁晓夫的思想。
    全国解放后，中国的赫鲁晓夫几次跑到天津，和大资本家宋棐卿眉来眼去，勾勾搭搭，向资本家乞求剥削，压制工人革命。这同武训跪在地主老爷面前讨钱，不是如出一辙吗！
    武训打着“为人民办学”的招牌，中国的赫鲁晓夫也挂着“发展民族工业”的幌子。他们一样是向剥削阶级投降，甘当剥削阶级的奴隶。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派这样干，就是要取消阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政，企图把刚刚获得解放的劳动人民重新推进火坑，使他们重新过牛马不如的日子。
    毛主席及时向我们发出了《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的伟大号召。
    这是全国解放以后思想文化领域里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线第一次交锋。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命派，要运用文艺这个武器，来巩固无产阶级专政，来推进社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业；党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子，他们要利用文艺制造反革命舆论，毒害人们的思想，以便实现资本主义复辟。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命粉碎了一小撮反革命修正主义分子的迷梦，毛主席的革命路线取得了伟大胜利。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们工人阶级坚决按照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的教导，大鼓革命造反精神，大造党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，批透奴隶主义、投降主义，把党、政、财、文大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级手里，使我们国家沿着社会主义——共产主义的大道阔步前进。
