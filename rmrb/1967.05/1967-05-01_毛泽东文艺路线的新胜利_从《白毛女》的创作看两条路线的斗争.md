The evening of April 24, 1967, at 7:53 PM, was the happiest and most unforgettable moment of our lives. Our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, watched our performance of the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl." "Chairman Mao has come! Chairman Mao has come!" We have longed for this day and night. Today, our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, finally came among us, shook hands with us, and took photos with us. We cheered, we sang, and we raised our arms thousands of times to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

On this restless night, our thoughts surged like a galloping horse across a vast plain. Reflecting on the creation process of the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl," it was a process of the struggle between Mao Zedong's proletarian literary line and the revisionist literary black line. It was also a process of struggle between the proletarian revolutionaries and a handful of revisionist elements within the Party. The birth of the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" is a great victory of the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought, a heavy blow to the revisionist literary black line, and a heavy blow to a handful of revisionist elements within the Party and their backers, the top capitalist-roaders within the Party.

For more than a decade, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the literary front has been extremely sharp and complex. A handful of revisionist elements in the former Propaganda Department, former Ministry of Culture, and former Beijing Municipal Committee refused to implement the proletarian literary line and literary policies clearly stated in Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and his two wise directives on the literary circle in 1963 and 1964. They went against the grain, vigorously promoting feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature, making the entire literary circle filled with the foul air of worshipping the past, admiring the West, and despising the living. Comrade Jiang Qing loyally and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's literary line. She bravely broke through the numerous obstacles set by the former Propaganda Department, former Ministry of Culture, and former Beijing Municipal Committee, and launched a fierce attack on the strongholds of Peking opera, ballet, and symphony. With unyielding perseverance and daring revolutionary spirit, she, with the support of revolutionary literary workers, established model revolutionary modern plays such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "Red Detachment of Women," and "The Red Lantern," making special contributions to the cultural revolution. Comrade Ke Qingshi was a strong supporter of Comrade Jiang Qing's theater revolution. He once clearly pointed out to the former Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Department, former Cultural Bureau, and a handful of capitalist-roaders within our school: "You perform 'Swan Lake,' and I won't watch it. If you don't create modern-themed plays, what do you need this dance school for?" However, the former Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Department, former Cultural Bureau, and a handful of capitalist-roaders within our school tried every means to resist. They meticulously planned to stage "Swan Lake," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," "The Daughter of Spain," and other so-called 17th and 18th-century classical ballet "masterpieces." It was only under the situation where Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line was increasingly winning the hearts of the people that this handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in order to gain political capital, continued to play the evil trick of waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, and were forced to create and rehearse the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl."

During the creation of "White-Haired Girl," Comrade Zhang Chunqiao timely and clearly pointed out: "Emphasize class struggle, emphasize armed struggle, emphasize the Party's leadership; do not overly emphasize the love relationship between Daqiu and Xier." However, this handful of capitalist-roaders suppressed this correct opinion for a long time and did not pass on a single word to us. They tried every means to stuff some revisionist black goods into this revolutionary ballet, attempting to strangle this new thing. The capitalist-roader in the former Shanghai Municipal Committee Propaganda Department even personally wrote a lyric for Xier's escape into the wilderness: "In the wilderness, I shed tears and blood, I endure the torment, ... I wait for the opportunity, not rushing the morning and evening, I long and long..." This completely goes against Chairman Mao's spirit of "seizing the day" and promotes the reactionary idea of fatalism and the elimination of class struggle. It was this capitalist-roader who also "led" us to appreciate Soviet revisionist "Romeo and Juliet" and British "Red Lotus" ballet films. After watching, he not only did not criticize but also praised the high technique of these films, asking us to "learn from them." He also carefully tried to add pas de deux and lifts to the ballet "White-Haired Girl," even proposing the extremely absurd argument of whether Daqiu and Aunt Zhang could do a pas de deux. In handling the relationship between Daqiu and Xier, he shamelessly said: "Daqiu not finding Xier after returning to the village is unreasonable. The first thing he should do after returning to the village is to find Xier." "How should Daqiu find Xier? He should find her in the 'Red Dates Dance,' and the action should be intense, and the audience should have a reaction." Thus, for a while, during rehearsals, the Eighth Route Army cadre Daqiu, who had been away for more than three years, was seen running around among the female performers in the "Red Dates Dance," busy and happy, just like the prince in "Swan Lake" searching for Odette (the White Swan) among the swans. They tried to promote personal feelings in the play, distort the image of the Eighth Route Army heroes, and attempt to turn "White-Haired Girl" into a copy of "Swan Lake." The revolutionary teachers and students armed with Mao Zedong Thought firmly resisted, and their wolfish ambitions were not realized.

After the rehearsal of "White-Haired Girl," it received strong support from Premier Zhou Enlai and Comrade Jiang Qing. However, a handful of revisionist elements in the former Propaganda Department strongly opposed it. The former deputy minister of the Propaganda Department and revisionist element Lin Mo Han once said after watching the performance of "White-Haired Girl" that this play should be a lyrical play, the ballet was too revolutionary, the gunpowder smell was too strong, and the armed struggle was too prominent. He also said that Yang Balao being beaten to death was not moving, and he should die from drinking brine to be moving. This revisionist element was terrified of revolution, armed struggle, and the fighting spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The revisionist element Zhou Yang and his gang, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, also strongly belittled the ballet "White-Haired Girl," thinking that "Swan Lake" was a "cake," and revolutionary modern-themed ballet was a "steamed bun." Chairman Mao taught us that being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing. This handful of revisionist elements fiercely opposed the revolutionary reform of ballet, which precisely proves that we are on the right track. We must rebel against the old foreign ballet that was used to entertain old masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies. We must perform and sing the proletarian feelings of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the backer and leader of this handful of revisionist elements. He has always opposed and hated the theater revolution. On the issue of ballet reform, he once insidiously said: "Reflecting modern life cannot be forced, ballet and foreign opera may not be able to reflect." The revolutionary modern ballet "Red Detachment of Women" and "White-Haired Girl," born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have refuted his fallacies with ironclad facts! From the above few examples, it is enough to show that the birth of the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" is another great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line. Those who tried to interfere with the creation of "White-Haired Girl" and play tricks, cause trouble, and sabotage are dreaming! We must thoroughly expose, criticize, and settle accounts with the tricks they played, the trouble they caused, and the sabotage they did in the creation of "White-Haired Girl"!

This year marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of the brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" by our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, and the first anniversary of the birth of the minutes of the conference of military literary workers convened by Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, and entrusted to Comrade Jiang Qing. At this historic moment of great significance, our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, watched our performance of the revolutionary modern ballet "White-Haired Girl." This is the greatest encouragement, trust, care, and spur for all of us revolutionary teachers and students. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You taught us: "So many things, all urgent; the world turns, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we must seize the day." We must follow your teachings and, with the spirit of seizing the day, launch a fierce attack on feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature; with the spirit of seizing the day, we must rise up with a thousand-pound hammer and sweep the princes, nobles, talents, and beauties into the garbage heap of history; with the spirit of seizing the day, we must prominently display socialism and communism on the literary stage and firmly establish the proletarian spirit; with the spirit of seizing the day, we must perform and sing the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers forever stand on the revolutionary literary stage. We will definitely seize the power on this stage and reverse the inverted history. Chairman Mao, please rest assured that we deeply understand the heavy burden on our shoulders and deeply understand the arduous journey ahead. "Only heroes drive tigers and leopards, and there are no heroes afraid of bears and wolves." For the construction of proletarian new literature, for the eternal stability of the socialist iron mountain, and for the early completion of the communist building, we must make up our minds and fight the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, forever following Chairman Mao, forever holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advancing in the great winds and waves! Advance! Advance! Advance!

    毛泽东文艺路线的新胜利
    ——从《白毛女》的创作看两条路线的斗争
    上海市舞蹈学校　永卫东
    一九六七年四月二十四日晚上七点五十三分，是我们一生中最最幸福最最难忘的时刻，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席观看了我们演出的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。“毛主席来了，毛主席来了！”日日想，夜夜盼，今天，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席终于到我们中间来了，和我们握手，和我们合影。我们欢呼，我们歌唱，我们千万次地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    在这个不平静的夜晚，我们的思潮象骏马在广阔的原野上放纵奔腾。回顾革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的创作过程，正是毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线同修正主义文艺黑线斗争的过程，也是无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮修正主义分子斗争的过程。革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的诞生，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是对修正主义文艺黑线的沉重打击，是对党内一小撮修正主义分子以及背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的沉重打击。
    十几年来，文艺战线上两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的斗争是十分尖锐复杂的。旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委中的一小撮修正主义分子，拒不执行毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作中早就阐明了的无产阶级文艺路线和文艺方针，拒不执行毛主席一九六三年和一九六四年关于文艺界的两个英明批示。他们反其道而行之，极力推崇封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的文艺，使整个文艺界充满了厚古薄今、崇洋非中、厚死薄生的恶浊空气。江青同志最忠实、最坚决地执行毛主席的文艺路线，她勇敢地冲破了旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委的重重阻挠，大造“名、洋、古”的反，向京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响乐这些顽固堡垒发动了进攻。她以百折不回的顽强毅力和敢想敢干的大无畏的革命精神，在革命文艺工作者的支持下，树立了京剧《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》、《海港》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》等革命现代戏的好样板，对文化革命作出了特殊的贡献。柯庆施同志是大力支持江青同志进行戏剧革命的。他曾明确地向旧上海市委宣传部、旧文化局以及我校党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派指出：你们演《天鹅湖》，我就是不看，你们再不搞现代题材的戏，还要你们这个舞蹈学校干什么？但是，旧上海市委宣传部、旧文化局及我校党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，却千方百计地进行抵制。他们处心积虑地想大搞《天鹅湖》、《巴黎圣母院》、《西班牙女儿》等所谓十七、十八世纪的古典芭蕾“经典著作”。只是在毛主席的革命文艺路线越来越深入人心的形势下，党内这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了捞取政治资本，继续玩弄打着“红旗”反红旗的罪恶勾当，才被迫创作和排演革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。
    张春桥同志在《白毛女》的创作过程中，及时而又明确地指出：要突出阶级斗争，突出武装斗争，突出党的领导；不要过多地表现大春和喜儿的爱情关系。可是这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却长期扣压这一正确意见，一个字也不向我们传达。他们千方百计地想把一些修正主义的黑货塞到这个革命的芭蕾舞剧中去，妄图扼杀这一新生事物。旧上海市委宣传部内走资本主义道路的当权派还亲手为喜儿逃进荒山写了一段歌词：“我在荒山流尽泪和血，我忍受煎熬，……我等待时机，不争朝夕，我盼啊盼啊……。”完全和毛主席提出的“只争朝夕”的精神唱反调，宣扬听天由命取消阶级斗争的反动观念。就是这个走资本主义道路的当权派，还亲自“带领”我们去欣赏苏修的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》及英国的《红菱艳》等芭蕾舞影片，看后不仅不消毒，还大肆吹捧这些影片的技巧之高，要我们“学习”。他还煞费苦心地想在《白毛女》舞剧中加双人舞和托举，甚至提出了“大春与张二婶能否双人舞”的极端荒谬的论调。在大春和喜儿的关系处理上，他竟无耻地说：“大春回村后不找喜儿是不合情理的，回村第一件事就应该找喜儿。”“大春找喜儿怎样找？要在红枣舞里找，找的动作要强烈，群众也要有反映。”于是一度在排练当中出现了参军三年多的八路军干部大春在跳红枣舞的女演员中穿来穿去地找喜儿，忙得不亦乐乎，犹如《天鹅湖》中王子在天鹅湖畔的群鹅中寻找奥杰塔（白天鹅）一般。他们在剧中竭力宣扬儿女私情，歪曲八路军的英雄形象，妄图把《白毛女》变为《天鹅湖》的翻版。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命师生，进行了坚决的抵制，他们的狼子野心才未能得逞。
    《白毛女》排演以后，就得到周恩来总理和江青同志的大力支持。可是，旧中宣部的一小撮修正主义分子却极力反对。旧中宣部副部长、修正主义分子林默涵，有一次看完《白毛女》演出后，胡说什么这个戏应该是抒情戏，舞剧太革命了，火药味太浓了，武装斗争太突出了，还说什么杨白劳被打死不好，要喝盐卤死才感动人。这个修正主义分子对革命、对武装斗争、对贫下中农的斗争精神，害怕得要死。修正主义分子周扬及其一伙，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，还极力贬低芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，认为《天鹅湖》是“蛋糕”，革命现代题材的芭蕾舞是“窝窝头”。毛主席教导我们，被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。这一小撮修正主义分子拚命反对芭蕾舞的革命改革，这正雄辩地说明我们的路子走对了。对旧的供老爷太太少爷小姐们消遣的洋芭蕾，我们就是要造反。我们就是要大演特演工农兵，就是要大抒特抒无产阶级的感情。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是这一小撮修正主义分子的总后台、总头目。他一贯反对和仇视戏剧革命，在对待芭蕾改革的问题上，他就阴险地说过：“反映现代生活不能勉强，芭蕾舞、外国歌剧不一定能反映。”在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，用铁一般的事实驳倒了他的谬论！从以上一小部分事例中，足以说明革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的诞生，是毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线的又一次伟大胜利。把黑手伸进《白毛女》创作中的一小撮修正主义分子，妄想贪天之功为己功，这是白日做梦！他们在《白毛女》创作过程中所玩弄的阴谋，所进行的破坏和捣乱，我们一定要彻底揭发，彻底批判，彻底清算！
    今年是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年纪念，是毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作者座谈会纪要诞生一周年纪念。在这具有重大历史意义的时刻，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席观看了我们演出的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，这是对我们全体革命师生最大的鼓舞，最大的信任，最大的关怀，最大的鞭策。毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家教导我们：“多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”我们一定要遵循您的教导，用只争朝夕的精神，向封建主义文艺、资本主义文艺、修正主义文艺猛烈进攻；用只争朝夕的精神，奋起千钧棒，把王公贵族、才子佳人扫进历史的垃圾堆；用只争朝夕的精神，在文艺舞台上大标社会主义、共产主义之新，大立无产阶级之异；用只争朝夕的精神大演特演工农兵，使工农兵的英雄形象永远挺立在革命的文艺舞台上。这个舞台上的权，我们夺定了，我们就是要把颠倒的历史重新颠倒过来。毛主席您老人家放心吧，我们深深懂得自己肩上的担子有多重，我们深深懂得前面的路程是何等艰巨。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”为了建设无产阶级的新文艺，为了使社会主义的铁打江山永不变色，为了使共产主义大厦早日建成，我们这一代要下定决心，誓死把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永远永远跟着毛主席，永远永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在大风大浪中前进！前进！前进！
