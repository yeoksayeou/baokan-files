	Nixon Flees Latin America Amidst People's Opposition

	Former U.S. Vice President Nixon recently visited Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico to engage in conspiratorial activities. He once again faced strong opposition from the awakening people of Latin America and fled in disgrace amidst the crowd's jeers.

	Western news agencies reported that Nixon's mood during this Latin American trip was even heavier than it was nine years ago when he was beaten there. Nixon also admitted: "Guerrilla activities in Latin America are increasing," and this "dangerous" problem is "more serious than he had imagined when he left the United States."

	U.S. Imperialism Gives Indian Government a Bribe

	U.S. imperialism and the Indian government recently signed an agreement, stipulating that the United States will provide India with a loan of $132 million to purchase American goods, effectively dumping large quantities of American goods into India.

	So far, India has accepted approximately $7.6 billion in "aid" and 50 million tons of American grain. The result is that India has become a huge market for U.S. imperialism to dump "surplus" agricultural products, machinery, and other goods.
