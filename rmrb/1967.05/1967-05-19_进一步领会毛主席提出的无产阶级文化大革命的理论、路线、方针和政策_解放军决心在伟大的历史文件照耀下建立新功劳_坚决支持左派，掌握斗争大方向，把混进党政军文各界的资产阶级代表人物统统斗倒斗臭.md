The People's Liberation Army, which has made tremendous contributions in participating in and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has enthusiastically hailed the publication of the great historical document, the Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They said that Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, solving the theoretical and practical issues of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. This is a great milestone in the history of Marxism. They expressed their determination to further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to build new achievements and establish new merits in defending the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

On the coastal defense lines, border outposts, naval docks, air force bases, and various camps, loudspeakers continuously broadcast the Circular and important articles from the editorial departments of the magazines "Red Flag" and "People's Daily" titled "A Great Historical Document." Soldiers listen to the broadcasts, read newspapers, hold celebration meetings, and put up wall newspapers. Everyone is excited and joyous, creating a festive atmosphere. The entire garrison of a certain regiment stationed on the front line of the Liaodong Peninsula, who have made the island their home, gathered in front of the "Tiananmen" built by the soldiers using pebbles to listen to the broadcast. They excitedly said: This is the voice of Chairman Mao, this is a document of epoch-making significance, every word and sentence resonates in our hearts.

The soldiers of the regiment where the selfless communist warrior Cai Yongxiang once served recalled the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution over the past year. They unanimously said that over the past year, under the guidance of this great historical document personally formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country have exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen. They have thoroughly smashed their plots to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and attempt to restore capitalism, achieving brilliant results in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers of the people, who regard the dictatorship of the proletariat as their lifeline, best understand class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They clearly know that power is life; losing power means losing everything. Over the past year, they have fought on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. They have deeply understood that the proletariat must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie aims to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have also come to realize in the storms of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that the main targets of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat are the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship organs, those who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, and the power-holders within the Party and government organs who are taking the capitalist road. The son of Liu Lianren, who was rescued from Japan nine years ago and is now a squad leader in a certain unit of the Jinan Military Region, said: My father Liu Lianren was captured by the Japanese devils to Japan to work as a laborer, suffering immensely, and escaped to live in the mountains for thirteen years. This suffering is because we had no power, no dictatorship of the proletariat. In 1958, my father was able to return to the embrace of our motherland and see the sun again because we had power, the dictatorship of the proletariat. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road want to restore capitalism in China and implement bourgeois dictatorship, which is absolutely impossible! We must overthrow these enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure they never rise again! Soldiers of a certain company who participated in the battle to liberate Beijing and Tianjin recently joined the ranks of supporting the seizure of power by the revolutionary leftists of Beijing. While studying this great historical document, they repeatedly read the following passage: "Bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, government, military, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power." They said, our struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen completely confirms Chairman Mao's extremely wise foresight. Peng Zhen's "February Outline" is a program for restoring capitalism and is also the counter-revolutionary revisionist program of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. We will not let their plots succeed. We will use the power of the dictatorship of the proletariat to seize their power and implement their dictatorship. We will remember this "power" for generations to come. Soldiers of a certain company who were awarded a collective third-class merit in the Battle of Triangle Hill said: Bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship organs and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies of our dictatorship of the proletariat. We are determined to carry forward the revolutionary fighting spirit of Triangle Hill and, together with the revolutionary leftists, resolutely overthrow and expose them.

Soldiers participating in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, together with the revolutionary leftists, have, in recent days, reviewed the battle course of the past year while studying this great historical document and summarized the experiences and lessons of grasping the direction of the movement. Their understanding is: supporting the left is to politically and ideologically support the left, to bring Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the revolutionary masses, to achieve the great unity of the revolutionary leftists, to unite the majority of the masses and cadres, to seize the power of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to implement their dictatorship, and to thoroughly overthrow them. This is the direction of the struggle. We must firmly grasp this direction. Representative Tan Tianhe of the garrison in Guiyang Cotton Mill, Guiyang City, said: The experience of the past year's struggle proves that Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the fundamentals of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. Only by grasping this fundamental can we firmly grasp the direction of the movement. In the face of the current serious struggle tasks, we must stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, most resolutely support the revolutionary leftists, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, achieve the great unity of the revolutionary leftists in the great criticism movement, and combine the great criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit to complete the task of struggle, criticism, and transformation. National combat hero and chief of staff Wei Xiaotang of a certain division said: The Circular shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought. We stand firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and on the side of the revolutionary leftists, believe in and rely on the broad masses, believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres, further use Mao Zedong Thought to organize the surging Great Cultural Revolution army, concentrate firepower, and thoroughly criticize and overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Soldiers of a certain unit of the Qinghai garrison unanimously expressed that the People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally founded by Chairman Mao, a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We are most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, most loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and most loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We are determined to firmly grasp the revolutionary gun and pen, fight side by side with the broad revolutionary masses, launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen, expose all the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, government, military, and various cultural circles, overthrow them, and ensure they never rise again. Soldiers of the "Three Victories in Three Battles" air force unit, while vigilantly guarding the airspace of our motherland, seriously study the Circular. They said, the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is rolling forward. In the great criticism movement of the broad revolutionary masses, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed! This is the greatest victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage than to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We vow to use the Circular as the strongest ideological weapon, carry forward the brave fighting and continuous combat style, fiercely attack the American wolves in the air and the "fallen dogs" on the ground! If enemy planes come, we will attack the enemy planes; if enemy planes do not come, we will criticize "Self-Cultivation"! We will resolutely criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, criticize them deeply and thoroughly. Soldiers of the "Sea Tiger Boat" on the front line of Fujian, who guard the coastal defense lines day and night, said, the publication of the Circular and the article is the strongest and sharpest weapon given to us by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee at this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We must never forget class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, always be highly alert, be ready at any time to annihilate the daring enemy, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the end.

    进一步领会毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策
    解放军决心在伟大的历史文件照耀下建立新功劳
    坚决支持左派，掌握斗争大方向，把混进党政军文各界的资产阶级代表人物统统斗倒斗臭
    新华社十八日讯　在参加和保卫无产阶级文化大革命中作出了巨大贡献的人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员，连日来，热烈欢呼伟大的历史文件中共中央《通知》的发表。他们说，毛主席创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是马克思主义发展史上一个伟大的里程碑。他们表示决心进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，在捍卫无产阶级专政、捍卫无产阶级文化大革命中建新功立新劳，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在海防线上，在边疆哨所，在海军码头、空军机场和各个营区，广播喇叭不停地播送《通知》和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》编辑部《伟大的历史文件》的重要文章，指战员们认真听广播、读报纸，开庆祝大会，出墙报，个个奔走相告，欢喜若狂，呈现出节日般的欢腾。守卫在辽东半岛前哨的某部“以岛为家”守备连全体指战员，个个手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，列队来到战士们用卵石筑成的海岛“天安门”前收听广播。他们激动地说：这是毛主席的声音，这是具有划时代意义的文献，字字句句都说到我们战士的心坎里。
    一心为公的共产主义战士蔡永祥生前所在连队的指战员们，回顾了一年来文化大革命的伟大成果，他们异口同声地说，一年来，在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的这一伟大历史文件的指引下，全国亿万革命群众揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揪出了彭真反革命修正主义集团，彻底粉碎了他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命，妄图实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，这是无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌战果，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    把无产阶级专政当作命根子的人民子弟兵，最懂得无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是政权问题。战士们最清楚，政权就是命权，丢了政权，就丢了一切。一年来，他们战斗在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的第一线，对无产阶级就是要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级就是要推翻无产阶级专政，体会得最深刻。他们在无产阶级文化大革命的风雨中还清楚地认识到：无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是那些打着红旗反红旗，混入党和政权领导机关内部的走资本主义道路的当权派。九年前从日本被营救回国的难胞刘连仁的儿子、济南部队某部班长说：我父亲刘连仁被日本鬼子抓到日本当苦工，苦得没法过，逃到深山穴居十三年，这苦根子就是我们没有政权，没有无产阶级专政。一九五八年，我父亲能从日本回到祖国怀抱，重见太阳，就是因为我们有了政权，有了无产阶级专政。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一心想在中国搞资本主义复辟，实行资产阶级专政，这一万个办不到！我们一定要把这些无产阶级专政的死敌打翻在地，叫他们永世不得翻身！曾经参加过解放平津战役的某连指战员，不久前又参加了支持北京市无产阶级革命派夺权的战斗行列。他们在学习这个伟大的历史文件时，反复地读着这样一段话：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权”。他们说，我们和彭真反革命修正主义集团的斗争，完全证实了毛主席的这个极其英明的预见。彭真抛出的《二月提纲》是复辟资本主义的纲领，也是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义的纲领。我们决不让他们的阴谋得逞，我们要发挥无产阶级专政的威力，夺他们的权，专他们的政。我们要世世代代牢记这个“权”字。在上甘岭战斗中荣立集体三等功的某部七连指战员们说：混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物、党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是我们无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人。我们决心发扬上甘岭的革命战斗精神，和无产阶级革命派一道坚决把他们斗倒、斗臭。
    参加支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的广大指战员和无产阶级革命派一起，连日来，在学习这个伟大的历史文件中，还认真回顾了一年来的战斗历程，总结了掌握运动大方向的经验和教训。他们的体会是：支左就是政治上、思想上支持左派，就是要把毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策带到革命群众中去，实现无产阶级革命派大联合，团结广大群众，团结干部的大多数，夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权，专他们的政，把他们彻底斗倒，这就是斗争的大方向。我们一定要牢牢掌握这个大方向。贵阳市贵阳棉纺厂的驻军代表谭天河说：一年来的斗争经验证明，毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，是无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的根本，只有掌握了这个根本，才能牢牢掌握好运动的大方向。在当前严重的斗争任务面前，我们要坚定不移地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，最坚决地支持革命左派，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，在大批判中，实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，把大批判运动同本单位的斗批改结合起来，胜利完成斗批改的任务。全国战斗英雄、某师参谋长卫小堂说：《通知》字字句句都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，我们坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在革命左派一边，相信和依靠广大群众，相信和依靠干部的大多数，进一步用毛泽东思想去组织浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，集中火力，彻底批倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。青海驻军某部指战员一致表示，人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的强大柱石，我们最忠于伟大领袖毛主席，最忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们决心紧握革命的枪杆子和笔杆子，和广大革命群众一道，并肩战斗，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，向彭真反革命修正主义集团猛烈攻击，把混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物统统揪出来，打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身。空军“三战三捷”部队的指战员们在警惕守卫祖国领空的同时，认真学习《通知》，他们说，无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，在广大革命群众的大批判运动中，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了！这是无产阶级文化大革命最重大的胜利！我们一定牢记毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们誓以《通知》为最强大的思想武器，发扬勇敢战斗和连续作战的作风，空中狠打美国狼，地面狠打“落水狗”！敌机来了揍敌机，敌机不来批《修养》！坚决把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底斗倒、斗臭，批深、批透。日日夜夜警惕守卫在海防线上的福建前线“海上猛虎艇”指战员说，《通知》和文章的发表，是毛主席和党中央在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线展开决战的关键时刻给予我们的最强大最锐利的武器。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争、念念不忘无产阶级专政，时刻百倍提高警惕，随时准备歼灭敢于来犯之敌，誓死捍卫无产阶级文化大革命，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
