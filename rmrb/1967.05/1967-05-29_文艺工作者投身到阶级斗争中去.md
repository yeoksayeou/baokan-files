Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: “All forms of art—drama, music, novels, poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, and so on—have problems, and many people are involved, but socialist transformation in many fields has achieved very little. In many fields, it is still the ‘dead’ who rule.” Chairman Mao’s words have sharply exposed the essence of the problem and raised the crucial issue in the literary and artistic circles.

Over the past seventeen years, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, under the command of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, have used various means to force feudal and capitalist ideas down our throats, poisoning us workers, peasants, and soldiers, and under the guise of “appreciation” and “entertainment,” making emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties the masters of our artistic stage.

I am a steelworker. Usually, when we are fighting with the roaring flames, boiling steel, and dancing sparks at the steel furnace, we are filled with a strong revolutionary spirit every moment, truly vigorous and full of fighting spirit. However, when we finish work and sit in the socialist artistic theater, what we see and hear is something else. Those soft, messy things are so out of tune with our revolutionary spirit at work. Such artistic works are not for us workers, peasants, and soldiers; they are for the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and for the restoration of capitalism.

Under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolution in Peking opera has created revolutionary model operas such as *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, *The Harbor*, *The Red Lantern*, *The White-Haired Girl*, and *Attack on the White Tiger Regiment*. These revolutionary model operas are powerful weapons for eliminating the bourgeoisie and establishing the proletariat, and such artistic works are what we workers, peasants, and soldiers need.

In his instructions, Chairman Mao criticized many in the literary and artistic circles for acting like officials and lords, not approaching workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflecting socialist revolution and construction. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has always gone against Chairman Mao, advocating that “artists can go to factories and villages by car.” How can artists reflect our lives and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers if they do not approach us?

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, artists armed with Mao Zedong Thought have thrown themselves into the class struggle, gone deep among workers, peasants, and soldiers, and performed many revolutionary and fighting artistic programs. Their actions have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is a victory for Chairman Mao’s line on literature and art, and a victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    文艺工作者投身到阶级斗争中去
    上钢三厂　韩忻亮
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着。”毛主席的话，一针见血地揭开了问题的实质，提出了文艺界的要害问题。
    十七年来，一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的指挥下，采取种种手段，把封建主义、资本主义的私货硬塞给我们工农兵，毒害我们工农兵，并假借“欣赏”、“娱乐”为名，让帝王将相、才子佳人成为我们文艺舞台的主人。
    我是一个炼钢工人。平时，我们在炼钢炉旁和熊熊的烈火、沸腾的钢水、飞舞的火花展开搏斗时，每时每刻都充满着一股强烈的革命斗志，真是意气风发，斗志昂扬。可是，每当我们工作完了，坐在社会主义的文艺舞台下面时，眼睛看的，耳朵听的，却是另外的一套。那些软绵绵、乱七八糟的东西，和我们在工作中雄赳赳、气昂昂的革命干劲是多么的不协调。那样的文艺作品决不是为我们工农兵服务的，不是我们所需要的；它是为地富反坏右服务的，为复辟资本主义服务的。
    在江青同志亲自领导下进行的京剧革命，创造了《智取威虎山》《海港》《红灯记》《沙家浜》《奇袭白虎团》等革命样板戏。这些革命的样板戏是灭资兴无的有力武器，这样的文艺作品才是我们工农兵需要的文艺作品。
    毛主席在批示中批评了文艺界很多人做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却一贯跟毛主席唱反调，提出什么“文艺工作者可以坐汽车下工厂，下农村。”文艺工作者不接近我们工农兵，又怎么能谈得上表现我们的生活，为工农兵服务呢？
    在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装的革命文艺工作者投身到阶级斗争中，深入工农兵，演出了许多革命的、战斗的文艺节目，他们的行动受到了广大工农兵的热烈欢迎。这是毛主席文艺路线的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
