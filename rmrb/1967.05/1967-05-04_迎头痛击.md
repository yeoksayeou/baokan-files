The hands of American imperialism, which invade Arab countries, have once again been caught red-handed by the Arab people.

The people of Yemen have recently launched a powerful anti-American demonstration, angrily destroying the American imperialist spy agency—the so-called "Fourth Point Plan" office in Yemen. The Yemeni government has also announced the abrogation of all agreements signed with the U.S. "International Development Agency" and has arrested and will prosecute two American spies who were engaged in disruptive activities. The Yemeni government and people's actions to safeguard their sovereignty and independence are entirely justified, and we, the Chinese people, firmly support them.

Under the guise of "aid," American imperialism has been engaged in subversive and destructive activities in Yemen. They not only set up secret radio stations and hid weapons, committing all sorts of evil deeds, but even openly fired at the Yemeni people and launched rockets at Yemeni ammunition depots. They dared to do such things in a sovereign country, which is utterly outrageous and extremely arrogant. Such brazen acts of aggression fully expose the treacherous and vicious nature of American imperialism, proving that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Arab people.

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." American imperialism thought it had succeeded, but instead, it suffered a swift blow from the Yemeni people. Since the Yemeni people have caught the criminal hand of American imperialism, they will surely cut it off decisively and will not allow it to reach in again. It can be believed that after this incident, the Yemeni people will be even more vigilant against the plots of American imperialism and will more resolutely safeguard their sovereignty and independence.

    迎头痛击
    美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的黑手，又一次被阿拉伯人民当场捉住了。
    也门人民最近掀起强大的反美示威，愤怒捣毁了美帝国主义在也门的间谍机构——所谓“第四点计划”的办事处。也门政府也宣布废除它同美国“国际开发署”签订的一切协定，并将进行捣乱活动的两名美国间谍逮捕法办。也门政府和人民维护主权独立的这种正义行动好得很，我们中国人民表示坚决的支持。
    美帝国主义打着“援助”的幌子，在也门大搞颠覆破坏活动。他们不仅私设电台，暗藏武器，为非作歹，甚至公然向也门人民开枪，向也门军火库发射火箭弹。他们在一个主权国家之内竟然干出这等事来，真是欺人太甚，狂妄之极。这种明目张胆的侵略行为，彻底暴露了美帝国主义口蜜腹剑的凶恶面貌，充分证明了美帝国主义是阿拉伯国家人民的最凶恶的敌人。
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的，“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”美帝国主义自以为得计，结果却反而遭到了也门人民的迎头痛击。也门人民既然抓住了美帝国主义这只罪恶的黑手，就一定要把它坚决砍掉，决不允许它再伸进来。可以相信，经过这一次事件以后，也门人民一定会更加警惕美帝国主义的阴谋，更加坚决地维护自己的主权独立。
