Macao compatriots have been flocking to the "British Consulate" and its subordinate "Visa Office" and the "British Consul's" residence to post slogans, expressing their strongest protest against the British authorities' bloody suppression of Hong Kong compatriots and firmly supporting the Hong Kong compatriots' struggle against persecution.

In recent days, tens of thousands of Macao compatriots, filled with indignation, have been continuously streaming to these three places. They loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations, sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" "Down with British Imperialism!" "The Chinese people are not to be bullied!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" The British Consul in Macao, A. I. Smith, the Vice Consul, G. P. Gamble, and the Visa Office Director, P. N. Pannell, were severely rebuked and questioned by the Macao Chinese compatriots who went to protest, leaving them in a state of embarrassment and disarray.

In recent days, many patriotic unions, associations, and schools in Macao have held protest meetings. The Macao General Union of Trade Unions issued a statement a few days ago, strongly condemning the British authorities' bloody crimes. Over a hundred representatives from various sectors of Macao held a meeting on the evening of the 16th, calling on all Macao compatriots to support the Hong Kong compatriots' just struggle with the most practical and effective actions. Macao compatriots, who have achieved significant victories in the struggle against the oppression of the Portuguese imperialists, solemnly warned the British authorities: Chinese compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. You must quickly and unconditionally accept the five serious demands of our government and the four serious demands of the "Committee of Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots Against British Oppression." Otherwise, the fate of the Portuguese will be yours.

On the 15th, from morning to evening, many loudspeakers on the streets of Macao broadcasted the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Many compatriots also copied the entire statement and posted it on the streets. Workers, peasants, patriotic teachers, and the broad masses of patriotic compatriots in Macao unanimously believe that the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs is a serious warning to American and British imperialism and a strong support for the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots who are bravely fighting. Workers pointed out: We Macao workers and patriotic compatriots are closely related to the workers and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, sharing weal and woe. Their struggle is our struggle. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle of Hong Kong worker compatriots, fight with them, and win with them!

    澳门同胞涌往“英国领事署”等处愤怒抗议港英当局镇压香港同胞
    坚决同香港爱国同胞并肩战斗
    据新华社香港十七日电　连日来数以万计澳门同胞怀着满腔怒火，川流不息地涌往澳门“英国领事署”及其属下的“签证办事处”和“英国领事”住宅三个地方张贴标语，最强烈抗议香港英国当局血腥镇压香港同胞的法西斯暴行，坚决支持香港同胞的反迫害斗争。
    前往抗议的同胞高声朗读毛主席语录，高唱毛主席语录歌，高呼“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“中国人民不可侮！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”等口号。英国驻澳门“领事”艾安时、“副领事”甘宝和“签证办事处主任”普纳，受到前往抗议的澳门中国同胞的愤怒斥责和质问，使他们窘态毕露，狼狈万分。
    几天来，澳门许多爱国工会、社团和学校纷纷举行抗议集会。澳门工会联合总会前几天发表声明，强烈谴责港英当局的血腥罪行。澳门各界同胞代表一百多人十六日晚举行集会，号召全澳同胞用最实际、最有效的行动来支持香港同胞的正义斗争。在反对澳葡帝国主义者迫害的斗争中取得重大胜利的澳门同胞，严正警告港英当局说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国同胞是不好惹的，你们必须迅速无条件地接受我国政府的五项严正要求和“港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会”的四项严正要求。否则，澳葡的下场就是你们的下场。
    十五日从早到晚，澳门街道上许多扩音器都广播着我国外交部的声明，许多同胞还把声明全文抄出来张贴街头。澳门工人、农民、爱国师生和广大爱国同胞一致认为，我国外交部的声明是对美英帝国主义的严重警告，是对正在英勇斗争的港九同胞的强有力支持。工人们指出：我们澳门工人和爱国同胞，与香港工人和爱国同胞是休戚相关、患难与共的。他们的斗争，就是我们的斗争。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持香港工人同胞的反帝爱国斗争，与他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
