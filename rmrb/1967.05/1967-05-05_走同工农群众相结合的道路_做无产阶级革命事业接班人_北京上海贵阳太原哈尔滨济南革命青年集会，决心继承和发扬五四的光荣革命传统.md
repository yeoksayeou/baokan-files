Red Guards and revolutionary youth from Beijing, Shanghai, Guiyang, Taiyuan, Harbin, and Jinan, along with proletarian revolutionary fighters, held meetings on May 3rd and 4th to celebrate their own fighting holiday—the May Fourth Youth Day.

The heroic Red Guards expressed at the meetings their determination to continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, inherit and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of May Fourth, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth youth. They vowed to follow the great leader, Chairman Mao, for life, firmly follow the direction indicated by the great helmsman, Chairman Mao, and unite with the workers and peasants for life. Through the great struggle of the masses, they will temper themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and ensure that the proletarian state remains red forever.

Tens of thousands of Red Guards, filled with boundless love for the great leader, Chairman Mao, recited together before the meeting: "The world belongs to you, to us, but in the final analysis, it belongs to you. You young people are in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. The future is in your hands." They sincerely wished Chairman Mao eternal life and good health for Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms!

In the great leader Chairman Mao's presence, in the birthplace of the great Red Guard movement—Beijing, the heroic Red Guards and other revolutionary youth, while celebrating May Fourth Youth Day, reviewed Chairman Mao's two brilliant works, "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement," published in 1939 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. They decided to advance courageously along the path indicated by Chairman Mao for intellectuals to unite with workers and peasants.

The Capital Red Guards' Revolutionary Committee held a celebration meeting today.

The Capital Red Guards said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we need not only a correct line and policy but also to cultivate and train millions of successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause... This is a major task for the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years." However, the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party attempt to cultivate our young generation into successors of the bourgeoisie to meet the needs of imperialism and reactionaries and serve the restoration of capitalism in our country. The biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the party's "Cultivation" openly advocates that young people cultivate bourgeois individualism and "cultivate" themselves into successors of the bourgeoisie. The Red Guards firmly declared: We are Chairman Mao's little red soldiers. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings. We will go to the workers and peasants, unite with them, reform our worldview, thoroughly criticize "Cultivation," and resolutely criticize and overthrow the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. In the great storms of class struggle, we will strive to temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death.

Shanghai Red Guards and revolutionary youth from various sectors held meetings on May 3rd and 4th, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and aspirations, to celebrate their own glorious fighting holiday—May Fourth Youth Day. The Red Guards and revolutionary youth pointed out at the meetings that commemorating this glorious day in the unprecedented high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has even greater significance. In the past, Chinese revolutionary youth rebelled against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and were truly the vanguard of the revolution. Today, under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have always been at the forefront of the struggle, playing a vanguard role.

Many revolutionary young people said in their speeches: In the history of the Chinese youth movement, there has always been a sharp struggle between two lines. Chairman Mao pointed out in his brilliant works "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement" as early as the direction of the youth movement, which is to take the path of uniting with workers and peasants. We, the revolutionary youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must thoroughly eliminate the poison of "Cultivation" in the great revolution of criticism, follow Chairman Mao's teachings to go to the class struggle and unite with the workers and peasants, humbly and sincerely learn from the working people, serve the working people, and persist for life on the path indicated by the great helmsman, Chairman Mao, of uniting with workers and peasants.

Revolutionary youth from the front lines of production expressed their determination to thoroughly implement and carry out Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," be both revolutionary pioneers and production models, play the role of a shock brigade in the current production and spring plowing, and achieve double victories in revolution and production with the broad revolutionary masses.

In the mountainous city of Guiyang, more than ten million Red Guards of various ethnic groups, revolutionary youth, revolutionary masses, and local troops held a grand meeting to celebrate May Fourth Youth Day. The vigorous revolutionary young people and revolutionary youth, along with proletarian revolutionary fighters, carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao to the Six Gates Stadium to participate in the celebration. The venue was filled with the sound of drums and gongs, and the atmosphere was festive. Li Zaichan, the head of the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee and deputy political commissar of the Guizhou Military Region, spoke at the meeting. He highly praised and warmly commended the broad Red Guards revolutionary young people in Guizhou for inheriting the legacy of revolutionary martyrs, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of May Fourth youth, and making immortal contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Representatives of the Guizhou Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought, workers from the Guiyang Cotton Mill, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army soldiers and model soldiers of love for the people spoke at the meeting.

More than five thousand revolutionary youth and Red Guards in Taiyuan held a meeting on May 3rd, firmly expressing their determination to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of May Fourth youth, resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly overthrow the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The meeting passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao. Leaders of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the Taiyuan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Taiyuan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Liu Geping, Zhang Riquing, and Chen Shouzhong participated in the meeting and celebrated the holiday with the revolutionary youth. Zhang Riquing said at the meeting that at this critical moment of life-and-death struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, we should commemorate May Fourth Youth Day by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct the spearhead of the struggle at the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the party, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly criticize the reactionary policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" in personnel issues, thoroughly criticize his "Cultivation," and combine this great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units and departments. In the great revolution of criticism, promote the great unity of the revolution. Chen Yonggui, a famous labor model nationwide and deputy head of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee, introduced at the meeting the heroic achievements created by the Dazhai youth in reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions in the struggle to change the sky and earth. He encouraged revolutionary youth to study Chairman Mao's works well and become reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In Harbin, many schools, factories, and institutions held meetings and discussions. They said excitedly that the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made us deeply realize that Chairman Mao cares infinitely for our young generation. He personally leads us to advance in the great storms of class struggle. We will inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of May Fourth youth, persist in the direction of the youth movement indicated by Chairman Mao, forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution, forever unite with the workers and peasants, pass on and carry forward the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and ensure that the proletarian state remains red forever.

More than a thousand proletarian revolutionary youth from various sectors in Shandong Province and Jinan City held a meeting in the evening of May 3rd. The representative of the Shandong Red Guards Command said that today, we come to celebrate May Fourth Youth Day, which has particularly important practical significance. We must carry forward the glorious tradition of May Fourth youth who dare to struggle, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao teaches us: "How do you judge whether a young person is revolutionary? What standard do you use? What do you use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants and whether he actually does so. Those who are willing and actually do so are revolutionary, otherwise, they are not revolutionary or counter-revolutionary." We Red Guards and proletarian revolutionary youth listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We must unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, learn from the People's Liberation Army, unite with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fight together, and win together.

    走同工农群众相结合的道路
    做无产阶级革命事业接班人
    北京上海贵阳太原哈尔滨济南革命青年集会，决心继承和发扬五四的光荣革命传统
    据新华社四日讯　北京、上海、贵阳、太原、哈尔滨、济南等省市的红卫兵和革命青年，以及无产阶级革命派战士纷纷在三日和四日举行集会，欢庆自己战斗的节日——五四青年节。
    英雄的红卫兵们在会上表示，决心更高举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，继承和发扬五四的光荣革命传统，发扬五四革命青年的造反精神，紧紧跟着最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命，坚决按照伟大统帅毛主席指引的方向，一辈子和工农群众相结合，在伟大的群众斗争中，把自己锻炼成为坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，永葆无产阶级的江山千秋万代，永不变色。
    成千上万的红卫兵在会前，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱的激情齐声朗读毛主席语录：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”他们衷心地祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！祝愿毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志身体永远健康！
    在伟大领袖毛主席身边，在伟大红卫兵运动的发源地——北京，英雄的红卫兵和其他革命青年，在欢庆五四青年节的时候，重温毛主席一九三九年为纪念五四运动二十周年发表的《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》这两篇光辉著作，决心沿着毛主席指出的知识分子同工农群众相结合的道路奋勇前进。
    首都大专院校红代会今天举行庆祝大会。
    首都红卫兵说：毛主席教导我们：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人……这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。”可是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图把我国青年一代培养成为资产阶级的接班人，以适应帝国主义和反动派的需要，为在我国复辟资本主义服务。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》，公然鼓吹青年去作资产阶级个人主义的修身养性，“修养”成资产阶级的接班人。红卫兵们坚决表示：我们是毛主席的红小兵，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢牢遵循毛主席的教导，到工农中去，同工农相结合，改造世界观，狠批《修养》，坚决批臭斗倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，努力把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    上海红卫兵和各界革命青年，在五月三日和四日，满怀革命的豪情壮志举行集会，欢庆自己光辉的战斗节日——五四青年节。红卫兵和革命青年在会上一致指出，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，纪念五四这个光辉的节日，具有更加重大的意义。过去，中国革命青年大造帝国主义的反、大造封建主义、官僚资本主义的反，不愧为革命的先锋队。今天，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导下，我们也始终站在斗争的最前头，起了先锋的作用。
    许多革命小将在发言中说：在我国青年运动史上一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。毛主席早在《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》的光辉著作中就指出了青年运动的方向，这就是走与工农相结合的道路。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命青年，一定要在革命的大批判中，彻底肃清《修养》的流毒，遵循毛主席的教导到阶级斗争中去，到群众中去和工农群众打成一片，恭恭敬敬地、诚诚恳恳地向劳动人民学习，为劳动人民服务，一辈子坚持伟大统帅毛主席所指引的与工农相结合的道路。
    来自生产第一线的革命青年表示，坚决贯彻和执行毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，既当革命的闯将，又当生产的模范，在当前的生产和春耕中发挥突击队的作用，和广大革命群众一起夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    山城贵阳各族红卫兵小将、革命青年、革命群众和当地驻军十多万人，今天隆重集会欢庆五四青年节。朝气蓬勃的革命小将和革命青年以及无产阶级革命派战士高举毛主席巨幅画像，来到六广门体育广场，参加庆祝大会。会场上锣鼓喧天，一片欢腾。贵州省革命委员会主任委员、贵州省军区副政治委员李再含在大会上讲话。他高度评价和热烈赞扬贵州广大红卫兵革命小将继承革命先烈的遗志，发扬了五四青年的革命造反精神，在无产阶级文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋。贵州省毛泽东思想红卫兵代表、贵阳棉纺厂的工人代表和人民解放军战士代表、爱民模范，分别在会上讲了话。
    太原市五千多名革命青年和红卫兵小将在三日举行的集会上坚决表示：要继承和发扬五四青年的革命造反精神，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。大会通过了给毛主席的致敬电。中共山西省核心小组和山西省革命委员会、中共太原市核心小组和太原市革命委员会的负责人刘格平、张日清和陈守中等参加了大会，与革命青年一起欢度节日。张日清同志在会上说，正当我们处在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死搏斗的决战时刻，来纪念五四青年节，就要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争矛头直指党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，彻底批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，彻底批判他的《修养》，并把这种大批判同本单位、本部门的斗批改结合起来，在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合。全国著名劳动模范、山西省革命委员会副主任陈永贵同志在会上介绍了大寨青年读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事，在改天换地的斗争中所创造的英雄业绩。他勉励革命青年好好学习毛主席著作，做无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
    哈尔滨许多学校、工厂、机关等红卫兵、革命青年和红色造反者，今天纷纷举行集会和座谈会。他们很激动地说，无产阶级文化大革命的实践，使我们更深刻地体会到，毛主席无限关心我们青年一代，他老人家亲自领导我们在阶级斗争的大风大浪中前进。我们要继承和发扬五四青年的革命精神，坚持毛主席所指示的青年运动的方向，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，永远同工农群众结合一起，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想接过来传下去，保证无产阶级江山千秋万代永不变色。
    山东省和济南市各界无产阶级革命派青年一千多人，三日晚举行集会。红卫兵山东指挥部代表说，今天，我们来庆祝五四青年节，有着特别重要的现实意义。我们要发扬五四青年敢于斗争，敢于革命，敢于造反的光荣传统，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。毛主席教导我们说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意，并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块，愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”我们红卫兵和无产阶级革命派青年最听毛主席的话，我们一定要做到和广大工农群众结合在一起，向人民解放军学习，和广大工农兵团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
