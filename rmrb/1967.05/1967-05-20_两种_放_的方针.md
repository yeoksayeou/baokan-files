The policy of "liberalization" proposed by Chairman Mao is the only correct policy for the proletariat to carry out a socialist revolution in the political and ideological realm. It is the only correct policy for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology. On the other hand, the so-called "liberalization" emphasized by Peng Zhen and the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is to implement bourgeois liberalization, allowing figures like Wu Han to spread poison, but not allowing the proletariat to cleanse it.

These two kinds of "liberalization" are diametrically opposed.

Revolutionary people must follow the policy of "liberalization" proposed by Chairman Mao, foster the spirit of daring to think, dare to do, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel, and take up the pen as a weapon to engage in great criticism and great struggle, and drag out those "representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles" from their dark corners, one by one!

    两种“放”的方针
    毛主席提出的“放”的方针，是无产阶级在政治思想领域进行社会主义革命的唯一正确的方针，是无产阶级在意识形态方面战胜资产阶级的唯一正确的方针。而彭真和党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派强调的所谓“放”，是实行资产阶级自由化，只许吴晗之流放毒，不许无产阶级消毒。
    这两种“放”是水火不相容的。
    革命的人民一定要按照毛主席提出的“放”的方针，发扬敢想、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，拿起笔杆作刀枪，进行大批判，大斗争，把那些“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物”，一个个从阴暗的角落里揪出来！
