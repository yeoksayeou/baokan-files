	The question of whether to carry out a violent revolution, seize political power through armed struggle, and establish proletarian dictatorship has always been the focal point of the struggle between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and all opportunism and revisionism.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war.” He also says: “The working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the power of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the entire world can only be transformed with the gun.” The practice of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution proves that “political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,” which is an unshakable truth.

	However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party openly contradicts Chairman Mao’s wise judgments. In his book “On the Cultivation of the Self,” he absurdly claims that “the communist parties and peoples of various countries” will “transform their own countries with their own hands, step by step transforming the world into a communist world.” He does not mention armed seizure of power or the role of the revolutionary gun. Without armed struggle, without violent revolution, to talk about “transforming” the country and “transforming” the world is sheer deception, a revisionist fallacy.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “Without a people’s army, people have nothing.” Revolutionary people have learned from long-term struggle that with the gun, one can seize political power, and the laboring masses can have a day to stand up; without the gun, there is no political power, and the laboring masses will never be able to rise up. The path of our people’s revolutionary victory is the path of seizing political power through armed struggle. If we follow the line of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, not carrying out violent revolution, not relying on the gun to speak, then the Chinese people will never be able to seize political power in a hundred years or a thousand years.

	The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has always opposed the revolutionary line of seizing political power through armed struggle. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he published the infamous “On the Cultivation of the Self,” leading people away from armed struggle at that time, closing the door to “cultivate the self,” and talking about “transforming” without substance; just after the War of Resistance Against Japan ended, at the critical moment when the Kuomintang reactionaries were preparing to launch a full-scale civil war, he openly spread illusions of peace, urging us to give up the armed seizure of political power and hand over the gun. In 1962, at the moment when Marxism and modern revisionism were engaged in fierce struggle over whether there should be proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, this Chinese Khrushchev again threw out “On the Cultivation of the Self,” still not mentioning the armed seizure of political power or proletarian dictatorship, openly echoing Khrushchev and responding in unison. The facts prove that he is not a “veteran revolutionary” at all, but a thorough and thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary, a genuine revisionist.

	Transforming the entire world with the gun barrel is the great strategic task that Chairman Mao has given us. Every true proletarian revolutionary should clearly establish this idea and have this great ambition. We must firmly grasp the gun in our hands, resolutely defend proletarian dictatorship, be ready at any time to annihilate all reactionaries who dare to invade, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have used the gun to create a proletarian dictatorship state. We believe that the proletariat and revolutionary people of the whole world will also be able to use the gun to create a bright red new world.

    用枪杆子改造整个世界

    要不要实行暴力革命，用武装夺取政权，实行无产阶级专政，这个问题从来就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同一切机会主义、修正主义斗争的焦点。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”又说：“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”中国革命和世界革命的实践证明，“枪杆子里面出政权”，这是颠扑不破的真理。
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派却明目张胆地和毛主席的英明论断唱反调。他在《修养》中胡说什么：“各国共产党和各国人民”通过“自己的手，去改造自己的国家，从而一步一步把世界改造成为共产主义世界。”根本不谈武装夺取政权，不谈革命的枪杆子的作用。离开武装斗争，离开暴力革命，空谈什么“改造”国家，“改造”世界，这完全是骗人的鬼话，修正主义的谬论。
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”革命人民从长期的斗争实践中体会到：有了枪杆子，才能夺取政权，劳动人民才有出头之日；没有枪杆子，就没有政权，劳动人民就永远也翻不了身。我国人民取得革命胜利的道路，就是武装夺取政权的道路。如果按照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的那一套去办，不搞暴力革命，不靠枪杆子发言，那么，中国人民一百年、一千年也夺取不了政权。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派一贯反对武装夺取政权的革命路线。在抗日战争初期，他抛出了臭名昭著的《修养》，引导人们离开当时的武装斗争，闭门“修养”，空谈“改造”；在抗日战争刚结束，国民党反动派准备发动全面内战的关键时刻，他公开散布和平幻想，要我们放弃武装夺取政权，把枪杆子交出去。在一九六二年，正当马克思主义同现代修正主义在要不要无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政问题上，展开激烈斗争的时刻，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，又把《修养》抛了出来，仍然只字不提武装夺取政权，不提无产阶级专政，公然同赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，遥相呼应。事实证明，他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是一个彻头彻尾的反革命，一个地地道道的修正主义分子。
    用枪杆子改造整个世界，这是毛主席给我们提出的伟大的战略任务。每个真正的无产阶级革命战士，都应该明确树立这个思想，都应该有这个雄心壮志。我们一定要紧握手里的枪杆子，坚决保卫无产阶级专政，随时准备消灭敢于来犯的一切反动派，坚决支持亚非拉和世界革命人民的革命斗争。中国人民在毛主席的领导下，用枪杆子打出了一个无产阶级专政的国家，我们相信：全世界无产阶级和革命人民，也一定能够用枪杆子，打出一个红彤彤的新世界。
