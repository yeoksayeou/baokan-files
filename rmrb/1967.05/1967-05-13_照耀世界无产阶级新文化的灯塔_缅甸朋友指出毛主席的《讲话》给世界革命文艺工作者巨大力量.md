A Burmese friend points out that Chairman Mao's "Speech" has given great strength to revolutionary literary and artistic workers around the world.

	NEW DELHI, May 13 (Xinhua) — Burmese writer Deqin Miaodan said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters in Yangon on the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that Chairman Mao's teachings on literature and art are a guide for the revolutionary cultural work of China and the world, pointing out a clear path for all revolutionary literary and artistic workers. We must deeply study and apply Chairman Mao's teachings.

	He said, Chairman Mao's teachings on literature and art are our sharp weapon in the struggle against reactionary views and various fallacies within the literary and artistic circles. It gives us great strength to create revolutionary literature and art. Therefore, progressive Burmese literary workers must always study Chairman Mao's works and take Chairman Mao's teachings as the guiding ideology for our literary and artistic work.

I am firmly convinced that the soldiers of the Chinese proletarian cultural army, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely defeat all enemies of the proletariat, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and advance courageously towards communism. I am firmly convinced that this great revolutionary movement will advance the world proletarian revolution and lead it to final victory.

	He said, I have made up my mind to study Chairman Mao's teachings on literature and art for life, and to resolutely follow and apply these teachings to complete the tasks of the proletarian revolution.
