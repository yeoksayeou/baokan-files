Vietnamese newspapers have issued a stern warning to American aggressors, stating that the U.S. imperialists' escalation of the war will lead only to a dead end.

New China News Agency, Hanoi, May 22 — On May 22, the Vietnamese newspaper *Nhan Dan* published an editorial condemning the U.S. imperialists' blatant dispatch of American and puppet troops for a large-scale invasion of the demilitarized zone. The editorial sternly warns the American aggressors that every one of their war "escalation" actions will inevitably meet with deserved retaliation. This has been the case in the past and will continue to be so in the future. Facing the American aggressors' frenzied actions, the Vietnamese people have the right to take all necessary measures to stop their evil deeds.

The editorial points out that the American aggressors' dispatch of large numbers of troops to the demilitarized zone is a new war escalation action with incalculable consequences.

The editorial states: The American aggressors are conducting a new "escalation" in their destructive war against North Vietnam. Recently, while continuing to bomb and strafe industrial areas and densely populated areas in the north, they have almost daily dispatched aircraft to bomb and strafe the capital city of Hanoi. The American bandits' new war "escalation" actions barefacedly expose their warlike nature. This proves that the American bandits' failures and their attempt to use war escalation to save their predicament are in vain, and it also exposes the fact that all the American bandits' "peace" talk is deceitful.

The editorial points out: The American aggressors' new "escalation" actions are precisely the desperate and foolish actions they take as they reach a dead end. These actions will make them fail even more quickly. The Vietnamese people have made full preparations. War escalation is the American bandits' dead end.

The *People's Army Newspaper* also published an editorial on May 22, stating that the American bandits' military activities in the demilitarized zone and their attacks on Hanoi and Haiphong are obviously part of the U.S. imperialists' plot to intensify and expand the war of aggression.

The editorial points out: Facts have proven that every new "escalation" by the Americans indicates the complete failure of the previous "escalation," and at the same time, it indicates the extremely difficult situation the American bandits are in regarding their war of aggression in South Vietnam. Their second "dry season offensive" in the south has met with complete failure. Their destructive war against the north has also met with complete failure. They cannot shake the Vietnamese military and people's resolute determination to resist the Americans and save the country.

The editorial states: The U.S. imperialists' most serious war "escalation" will inevitably lead to the heaviest failure and bear all the most severe consequences. The heroic Vietnamese people have sufficient strength and means to give the aggressors the punishment they deserve. Our military and people concentrate their hatred on the gun barrels, resolutely charging forward, fighting more fiercely, and making the American bandits pay back their blood debt fivefold, tenfold. No matter how the American bandits struggle desperately, we are determined to defeat them. Our people's cause of resisting the Americans will surely achieve complete victory.

    越南报纸对美国侵略者发出严厉警告
    美帝扩大战争只有死路一条
    新华社河内二十二日电　越南《人民报》二十二日就美帝国主义悍然派遣美伪军大规模进犯非军事区发表社论，严正警告美国侵略者：它的每一个战争“升级”行动，都必将遭到应得的还击。过去如此，今后仍然如此。面对美国侵略者的疯狂行动，越南人民有权采取一切必要的措施来制止它的罪恶行动。
    社论指出，美国侵略者向非军事区大规模派遣军队这一新的扩大战争的行动，孕育着不可估量的后果。
    社论说：美国侵略者在对越南北方的破坏性战争中，正在进行一次新的“升级”。最近，它在继续轰炸、扫射北方的各个工业区和居民稠密区的同时，几乎天天派遣飞机轰炸、扫射首都河内市。美国强盗的新的战争“升级”行动，赤裸裸地暴露了它的好战面目。这证明了美国强盗的失败并妄图用扩大战争来挽救困境的野心，还暴露了美国强盗的“和平”论调统统是欺人之谈。
    社论指出：美国侵略者的新的“升级”行动，正是它陷于穷途末路而采取的冒险和愚蠢的行动。这一行动将使它更快地走向彻底失败。越南人民已经作好了充分的准备。扩大战争就是美国强盗的死路。
    《人民军队报》二十二日也发表社论说，美国强盗在非军事区的全部军事活动以及袭击河内和海防，显然是美帝国主义加强和扩大侵略战争阴谋的一个组成部分。
    社论指出：事实证明，美国的每一次新“升级”，就表明过去的“升级”的彻底破产，同时也表明美国强盗在越南南方的侵略战争中的极其困窘的处境。它在南方的第二次“旱季反攻”遭到了彻底失败。它对北方进行的破坏性战争，同样也遭到了全面失败。它丝毫也不能动摇越南军民抗美救国的坚定决心。
    社论说：美帝国主义进行最严重的战争“升级”，必定招致最沉重的失败和承担一切最惨重的后果。英雄的越南人民有足够的力量和办法给予侵略者以应有的惩罚。我国军民把仇恨凝聚在枪口上，坚决冲上前去，打得更猛，要美国强盗五倍、十倍地偿还它欠下的血债。不管美国强盗怎样进行疯狂的挣扎，我们决心战胜它。我国人民的抗美事业必定获得全胜。
