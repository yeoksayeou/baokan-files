Aqaba Bay is located in the northern part of the Red Sea, between the Arabian Peninsula and the Sinai Peninsula. It is a narrow, elongated bay, about 100 miles long and 12 to 17 miles wide, situated between the United Arab Republic, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. At the southern end of Aqaba Bay, there are two small islands called Tiran Island and Sanafir Island, which control the entrance to the Red Sea from Aqaba Bay. The bay's mouth is nine miles wide.

On January 25, 1954, Egypt, in response to Israel's aggression, strengthened its blockade against Israel, which was in a state of war. Egypt announced the expansion of its control from the Suez Canal to Aqaba Bay and prohibited any ships from sailing to Israeli ports. After the failure of the 1956 invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, the British and French invading forces were forced to withdraw completely. With the support of U.S. imperialism, Israel refused to withdraw its invading forces and unreasonably demanded "freedom of navigation" in Aqaba Bay, using this as one of the conditions for withdrawal. At the same time, the United States openly advocated for the "internationalization" of Aqaba Bay. However, due to the strong opposition from the Egyptian people and other Arab countries, after several struggles, the Israeli invading forces were forced to withdraw.

    亚喀巴湾
    亚喀巴湾位于红海北部，阿拉伯半岛和西奈半岛之间，是一个细长的海湾，长一百英里，宽十二英里到十七英里，夹在阿联、以色列、约旦和沙特阿拉伯之间。在亚喀巴湾的南端有两个小岛叫蒂朗岛和塞纳菲尔岛，它们控制着亚喀巴湾进入红海的大门，湾口有九英里宽。
    一九五四年一月二十五日，埃及为反抗以色列的侵略，加强对处在战争状态中的以色列的封锁，宣布把控制范围从苏伊士运河扩大到亚喀巴湾，并禁止任何船只开往以色列港口。一九五六年英、法、以色列三国侵略埃及战争失败之后，英、法侵略军被迫全部撤退，以色列在美帝国主义的支持下，拒不撤走侵略军，无理要求在亚喀巴湾享有“自由”航行权，叫嚣以此作为撤军的条件之一，同时美国也公开叫嚷把亚喀巴湾“国际化”，但在埃及和其它阿拉伯国家人民的强烈反对下，经过多次斗争，以色列侵略军队才被迫撤出。
