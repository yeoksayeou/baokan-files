When I heard the top capitalist-roader in the Party spout nonsense like “exploitation saves people now, not allowing exploitation is dogmatism,” and “capitalists can exploit more, which is beneficial to the country and the people,” and other such twisted fallacies, it made my blood boil. At that moment, I naturally thought of Lei Feng, the class leader, and his miserable childhood. In the dark old society, the exploitative system that devours people, within less than three years, swallowed up Lei Feng's entire family of four. When Lei Feng was eight years old, he became an orphan without any support, enduring endless torment from the landlords. In that society where people were devoured, who suffered besides Lei Feng and his family? Lei Feng's suffering was the suffering of all the toiling masses, the suffering of an entire class. Take me, for example! My ancestors have been working for the landlords for generations, and for generations, we have been exploited by the landlords, carrying begging baskets and sticks to beat dogs, never leaving our sides. In that so-called “exploitation is beneficial” society, my grandfather started working for the landlord at the age of thirteen, and eventually died from overwork and bleeding to death. My father, to avoid the landlord's rent and taxes, fled to another village. However, as Lei Feng, the class leader, said: “Southern landlords are smiling tigers, northern landlords are living hells, crows are black all over the world.” Where there is an exploitative system, there is no way out for the poor. My father fled from place to place, still working for the landlord, and finally, his foot was pierced by a tree stump, he got tetanus, and died a miserable death. At that time, I was only one year old. My mother, who was seriously ill, carried me begging for food, and soon died from the torment. The evil landlords, like wolves and tigers, devoured my entire family. This is what the top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates as “more exploitation, beneficial to the country and the people”!

Just as I was struggling on the brink of death, the radiant rays of Mao Zedong Thought shone upon my hometown. Our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, saved me from the sea of suffering. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could I be alive today? Thinking of the past sufferings and looking at today's happiness, I hate the exploitative system that devours people. We have seen with our own eyes the evil of exploitation and tasted the bitterness of exploitation. Who knows better than us whether exploitation is guilty or not, whether exploitation saves people or devours them? The bloody and tearful history tells us: the exploitative system is a system where people devour people, a system where a few enjoy happiness while the majority suffer. Speaking from the standpoint of the laboring people, exploitation is not only guilty but also heinously guilty; exploitation does not save people, but kills and devours them. Our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, leads us in revolution precisely to completely eliminate exploitation from the entire globe and bury the exploitative system. The top capitalist-roader in the Party, who never forgets exploitation, praises the exploitative system that devours people to the skies, and tries every means to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism, attempting to reverse the wheel of history and make the laboring people pick up their begging sticks again. This is absolutely impossible.

    剥削制度吞噬了雷锋的一家
    战士　杜学洪
    我听到党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派胡说什么“现在剥削是救人，不准剥削是教条主义”，资本家“有本事多剥削，对国家对人民都有利”，等等一大堆颠倒是非的谬论，真把肺气炸了。这时，我自然而然地想起了雷锋班长的苦难童年。黑暗的旧社会，吃人的剥削制度，在不到三年的时间里，就吞噬了雷锋一家四口。雷锋八岁的时候，就成了一个无依无靠的孤儿，受尽地主的折磨。在那吃人的旧社会里，受苦受难的何止雷锋一人，雷锋一家。雷锋的苦难就是我们劳苦大众的苦难，是整个阶级的苦难。就拿我来说吧！我家祖祖辈辈给地主扛活，世世代代受地主剥削，讨饭的篮子，打狗的棍子，始终没有离开过。就在那所谓“剥削有功”的社会里，我爷爷十三岁就给地主扛活，最后累得吐血而死。我父亲为了躲避地主的租税，逃到外乡。但是，正象雷锋班长所说的那样：南方地主是笑面虎，北方的地主是活阎王，天下乌鸦一般黑。那里有剥削制度，那里就没有穷人的活路。父亲逃来逃去，仍旧给地主扛活，最后被树茬刺破脚，得了破伤风，活活地病死了。那时，我才一周岁，身带重病的母亲，背着我讨饭求生，不久也被折磨死了。万恶的地主狗豺狼，吞噬了我的一家。这就是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派宣扬的所谓“多剥削，对国家对人民都有利”！
    正当我在死亡线上挣扎的时候，光芒万丈的毛泽东思想照到了我的家乡，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席把我从苦海里救了出来。如果没有毛主席，我那能活到今天？想想过去的苦，看看今日的甜，我恨透了吃人的剥削制度。我们亲眼看到过剥削的罪恶，亲自尝过剥削的苦头，剥削有罪无罪，剥削到底是救人还是吃人，我们知道得最清楚，也最有发言权。血泪斑斑的历史告诉了我们：剥削制度就是人吃人的制度，就是少数人享福、多数人受苦的制度。站在我们劳动人民立场上来说话，剥削不但有罪，而且罪恶累累；剥削不是救人，而是杀人、吃人。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席领导我们闹革命，就是要从整个地球上彻底消灭剥削，埋葬剥削制度。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，念念不忘剥削，把吃人的剥削制度吹上天，千方百计地为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道，妄想把历史的车轮倒转，让劳动人民重新拿起讨饭棍，这是绝对办不到的。
