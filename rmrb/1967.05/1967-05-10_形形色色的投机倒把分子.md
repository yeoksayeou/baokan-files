In the collective farm markets and their affiliated markets in the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic, speculators are rampantly engaged in resale activities, reaping huge profits. They purchase fruits, potatoes, or vegetables at low prices from peasants and then sell them at inflated prices they set themselves. For example, Husain Kurbanov and Zhegaf Malikov are of this type. One day, they deceived a peasant and bought his watermelons and melons, worth 120 rubles, at a low price. Then, in front of the peasant, they openly sold them at three times the price.

In the display case of the third sales department of the "Tajik Fruit and Vegetable Company," only rotten tomatoes, cabbages, and wilted cucumbers are displayed, with no other vegetables. Is it true that there are no fresh vegetables? No! The salesperson, Kaparov, through his own dealers, took 1,300 kilograms of high-quality tomatoes to the market and sold them at high prices.

On the coast of the Sea of Azov, there are many peddlers and speculators waiting for the fishermen. They even come here in cars. At the purchasing station, fishermen sell one kilogram of sea bass for 25 kopecks, but in the market (where it is sold by the piece), a dozen sea basses are sold for 4 rubles. They are making a fortune.

The state retail price of meat is 1 ruble 90 kopecks per kilogram. However, profiteers take advantage of shortages to raise the market price of meat to 3 to 4 rubles per kilogram.

In the city of Guriev (on the Black Sea coast), black caviar is sold at 2 rubles per kilogram, but near a small church in Astrakhan, sinister-looking men with boxes are loitering there, selling black caviar at 4 rubles per kilogram. On the Sea of Azov, a can of 700 grams of black caviar is sold for 5 rubles.

    形形色色的投机倒把分子
    在苏联塔吉克共和国的集体农庄集市及其附设在各地的集市中，投机商人大肆进行倒卖活动，从中牟取暴利。他们从农民手中廉价收购瓜果、土豆或蔬菜，然后私自拟定价格出售。比如，胡赛音·库尔巴诺夫和热加甫·马利科夫就是属于这一类的人。有一天他们欺骗了一个农民，廉价收购了他的价值一百二十卢布的甜瓜和西瓜，然后当那个农民的面公然以三倍高的价格出售。
    在“塔吉克水果蔬菜公司”第三门市部的玻璃柜里只陈列着腐烂的西红柿、白菜和枯萎的老黄瓜，其他什么菜都没有。是不是确实没有新鲜的菜呢？不！门市部营业员加帕罗夫通过自己的商贩把一千三百公斤优质的西红柿拿到集市上高价卖掉了。

    在亚速海岸上有许多贩子和投机商人，他们守候着渔民们。他们甚至是坐着小轿车来到这里的。在收购站，渔民卖一公斤石斑鱼只得二十五戈比，而在市场上（这里是论条卖的）十几条石斑鱼就值四卢布。真是大发横财。
    肉的国家零售价格每公斤为一卢布九十戈比。而奸商就利用脱销的时候，把肉的市场价格抬高到每公斤三到四卢布。
                                 （据苏联《共青团真理报》）
    古里耶夫市（在黑海岸）的黑鱼子两卢布一公斤，而在阿斯特拉罕的小教堂附近，阴森的汉子带着箱子在那里徘徊，每公斤黑鱼子卖四卢布。在亚速海，买一罐七百克重的黑鱼子就要五卢布。
