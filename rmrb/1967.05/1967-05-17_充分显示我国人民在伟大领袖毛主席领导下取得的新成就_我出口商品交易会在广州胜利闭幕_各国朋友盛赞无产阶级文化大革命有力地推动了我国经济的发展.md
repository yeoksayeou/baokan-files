The 1967 Spring China Export Commodities Fair, held under the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, concluded successfully in Guangzhou on May 15. During the one-month fair, the transactions exceeded the original plan, and the trade volume saw a significant increase compared to the spring fair of the previous year.

This fair was unprecedented in scale. Participants included more than 7,800 people from over 60 countries and regions across five continents, including friends from the trade sector, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau. This was the largest number of participants in the history of the fair. Trade representatives from Guinea, Mali, Congo (Brazzaville), Zambia, Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan, Syria, and other Asian and African countries, as well as representatives from Japanese friendly trading companies, attended the fair.

A prominent feature of this fair was its strong revolutionary atmosphere. The fair was not only a grand venue for international trade activities but also a powerful platform for promoting Mao Zedong Thought. In all trade activity areas and exhibition halls, portraits of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and revolutionary people worldwide, and quotations from Chairman Mao were displayed. In the bustling and lively negotiation rooms, one could often see hosts and guests gathered together studying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." The fair also organized numerous seminars to introduce the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China to friends from the trade sector of various countries. Red Guards and the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams assisting the fair often performed small revolutionary cultural performances for the guests at the fair or in hotels. Guests from various countries, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau also watched the revolutionary modern Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "Red Detachment of Women," and the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," and listened to the revolutionary symphony "Shajiabang." Through these activities, the guests gained a deeper understanding of our country. Representative Budzo Antolre and Mogogo Jean Marie from the National Trade Bureau of Congo (Brazzaville) said when talking about their impressions of this fair that the numerous facts at the fair fully demonstrated the new achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is powerfully promoting the development of China's economy. They also said: Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for the people of all countries in the world to struggle for independence and freedom, and Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the world's revolutionary people. They expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works and master the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The tremendous achievements made in trade transactions at this fair thoroughly refuted the slanders of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries against our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In response to the great call of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production," the people of the entire country have achieved a great situation in industrial and agricultural production. Various places across the country provided a solid material foundation for this fair. The export commodities, in terms of variety, quantity, and quality, have shown significant growth and improvement. Industrial products such as textiles, clothing, light industry, machinery, and instruments saw a significant increase in export transactions compared to the spring fair of the previous year. The transaction situation for agricultural and sideline products, local specialties, livestock, and aquatic products was also good. Especially, the new products created during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution were widely praised at this fair. The transaction volume of new thematic art and craft products increased by approximately four times compared to the spring fair of the previous year. Friends from various countries, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau actively purchased various editions of Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at the fair. The retail service department of the fair has been supplying Chairman Mao badges since the opening, which have been in high demand.

On the evening of May 15, the fair held a grand closing banquet. Guests and representatives from various trade delegations of the fair totaling 2,700 people attended the banquet. The responsible persons of the fair and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, as well as representatives of the revolutionary factions of the foreign trade system and Red Guards, spoke at the banquet. They pointed out that the Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have always insisted on the policy of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual exchange in foreign trade. They expressed their belief that the fair will be held better and better each time.

    充分显示我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席领导下取得的新成就
    我出口商品交易会在广州胜利闭幕
    各国朋友盛赞无产阶级文化大革命有力地推动了我国经济的发展
    新华社广州十六日电  一九六七年春季中国出口商品交易会，在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，十五日在广州胜利闭幕。在为期一个月的交易会期间，达成的交易超过了原来预定的计划，贸易额比去年春季交易会有较大的增长。
    这次交易会规模空前盛大。参加交易会的有来自五大洲的六十多个国家和地区的贸易界朋友、华侨和港澳同胞共七千八百多人，是历次交易会最多的一次。几内亚、马里、刚果（布）、赞比亚、柬埔寨、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、叙利亚等亚非国家派出了贸易代表团、政府贸易官员、国营贸易公司代表以及贸易考察团参加了这次交易会。日本各友好商社共派出八百多名代表参加了这次交易会。
    这次交易会的突出特点是充满了强烈的革命气氛。这次交易会不但是一个盛大的进行国际贸易活动的场所，更重要的是一个宣传毛泽东思想的强大阵地。在所有进行交易活动的场所和展出商品的陈列大厅，都有中国人民和世界革命人民心中的红太阳毛主席的像和毛主席语录，在繁忙热闹的商品洽谈室里，还时常可以看到宾主围坐在一起学习《毛主席语录》。交易会还举办了许多次座谈会，向各国贸易界朋友介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的情况。协助交易会工作的红卫兵小将以及由交易会工作人员组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，经常在交易会或宾馆为客人表演小型的革命文艺节目。参加交易会的各国朋友和华侨、港澳同胞，还观看了革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》的演出，听了革命交响乐《沙家浜》。各国朋友通过这些活动，增进了对我国的了解。刚果（布）国家贸易局代表布德佐·昂托勒和莫果果·让·马利谈到他们参加这次交易会的观感时说，交易会的大量事实，充分显示出中国人民在伟大领袖毛泽东主席领导下所取得的新成就。中国的无产阶级文化大革命正在有力地推动着中国经济的发展。他们还说：毛泽东思想是世界各国人民为争取独立自由而斗争的强大武器，毛主席是世界革命人民的最杰出的领袖。他们表示要努力学习毛主席著作，掌握伟大的毛泽东思想。
    这次交易会在贸易成交方面取得的巨大成绩，彻底粉碎了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对我国无产阶级文化大革命的种种污蔑。全国人民热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，工农业生产战线呈现一片大好形势，全国各地为这次交易会提供了雄厚的物质基础，出口商品无论是品种、数量、质量都有显著的增长和提高。纺织品、服装、轻工业品、机械、仪器等工业产品，在这次交易会上的出口成交数量比去年春季交易会有较大的增长，农副产品、土特产、畜产、水产品的成交情况也很好。特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中创造的新产品，在这次交易会上受到普遍的赞扬。新题材的工艺美术品，成交数量比去年春季交易会增加约四倍。各国朋友、海外华侨和港澳同胞，在交易会上踊跃选购各种文字的毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》，交易会零售服务部供应的毛主席像章，从开幕以来一直供不应求。
    十五日晚，交易会举行了盛大的闭幕酒会。参加酒会的来宾和交易会各交易团代表共二千七百人。交易会负责人和对外贸易部负责人以及外贸系统的无产阶级革命派代表、红卫兵小将代表在酒会上的讲话中指出，我国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，一贯坚持平等互利、互通有无的对外贸易政策。他们表示深信，交易会将一届比一届办得更好。
