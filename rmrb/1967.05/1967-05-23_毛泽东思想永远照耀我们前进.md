As our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieves a great victory that shakes the world, and as hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses launch a fierce criticism and all-out attack on the handful of top Party persons in authority taking the capitalist road, we commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This has special significance.

"The Talks" is a landmark, great, and brilliant historical document and the guiding program for the proletarian cultural revolution. It creatively develops the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, reaching the pinnacle of contemporary Marxist-Leninist literary theory. This brilliant work has universal guiding significance not only for our country but also for the entire world; it has a special and important role not only at that time but also now and in the future; it is a beacon not only for literary and artistic workers but also for all revolutionary cadres, especially revolutionary intellectuals.

The central issue in "The Talks" is "the question of for whom and the question of how to serve the people."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art belong to the people. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are for their use." This not only points out the correct direction for our literary and artistic workers but also for revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres.

Serving the masses, first and foremost the workers, peasants, and soldiers, is the starting point for all our work. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the lifeline of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers means serving the proletariat in seizing and consolidating power, serving the proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating power." The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, in essence and at its core, is the issue of power. The central issue of the proletarian revolution is to seize power and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat; after the dictatorship of the proletariat is established, it must use all means to consolidate power and develop it. The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is precisely focused on this contradiction and struggle: the bourgeoisie wants to use the top Party persons in authority taking the capitalist road to restore capitalism and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; the proletariat wants to consolidate and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat and thoroughly smash the bourgeoisie's and their representatives within the proletarian dictatorship's beautiful dream.

Today, as we commemorate "The Talks," we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: always remember to serve the fundamental interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, the masses of the people, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us that the victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism is a possibility at any time. We must not think that by exposing and criticizing the top Party persons in authority taking the capitalist road, everything will be fine. No, even after this Cultural Revolution, the class enemies will not resign themselves to death and will continue to use new tricks to infiltrate the proletarian dictatorship, waiting for the opportunity to seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. We must be extremely vigilant about this and never let down our guard.

In "The Talks," Chairman Mao also thoroughly resolves the issue of how literature and art serve the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Literature and art should serve the people, the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The key is that literary and artistic workers must go among the people, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, go into the fiery struggle..."

This great teaching is not only a guide for literary and artistic workers but also for revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres.

Revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres are a very important, active, and positive force in the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution, and this Cultural Revolution. However, we must never forget that only the broad masses of workers, peasants, and laboring people are the true masters of the state, the true motive force of social development, and the true heroes of history, while we ourselves are often naive and laughable. Those who separate themselves from the workers, peasants, and laboring people will be discarded by history.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of young intellectuals and young cadres have become revolutionary pioneers. They are full of enthusiasm, daring, politically sensitive, and intellectually active, with the least conservative thoughts. However, in the revolutionary struggle, they have also shown some weaknesses of intellectuals, such as individualism, anarchism, cliquism, and factionalism. These weaknesses are manifestations of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois influences. Class enemies often exploit these weaknesses within our people to create divisions within the revolutionary ranks. We must face up to these weaknesses and overcome them. How to overcome them? The key is to go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to transform our worldview.

Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres must combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is not just a matter of being physically with the masses. Going among the workers, peasants, and soldiers means a thorough transformation of our worldview. In this brilliant work, Chairman Mao kindly shared his personal experience of emotional changes in his youth, explaining that only through long-term tempering and living, working, struggling, and breathing with the broad masses can one truly transform oneself.

Today, as we commemorate "The Talks," we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and definitely learn from Chairman Mao's brilliant example, combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, constantly transforming our worldview, and forever preserving our revolutionary youth. Only in this way can we ensure that our power never changes color and that the dictatorship of the proletariat is forever consolidated and developed.

Chairman Mao's brilliant work will forever be our compass. We must, under the guidance of this brilliant work, thoroughly criticize the handful of top Party persons in authority taking the capitalist road from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. We must further achieve the great unity of the revolutionary masses, implement revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations. We must combine the great criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units to complete the great task of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

### 毛泽东思想永远照耀我们前进

    沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利前进！
    ——纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    毛泽东思想永远照耀我们前进
    聂元梓
    正当我国无产阶级文化大革命取得了震撼世界的伟大胜利，亿万革命群众向着党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判、进行总攻击的时候，我们来纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，有着特别重要的意义。
    《讲话》是一部划时代的、伟大的、天才的历史文献，是无产阶级文化革命的指导纲领。它创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的世界观和文艺理论，是当代马克思列宁主义文艺理论的顶峰。这一光辉著作，不仅对我国，而且对全世界，都有普遍的指导意义；这一光辉著作，不仅在当时，而且在现在，在今后，都有特殊重要的作用；这一光辉著作，不仅对于文艺工作者，而且对于一切革命干部、特别是革命知识分子，都是指路的明灯。
    《讲话》最中心的问题，就是“一个为群众的问题和一个如何为群众的问题”。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这不仅为我们的文艺工作者，而且也为我们革命知识分子、革命干部，指出了唯一的、最正确的方向。
    为人民大众服务，首先是为工农兵服务，这是我们一切工作的出发点。无产阶级专政是工农兵的命根子。为工农兵服务，就要为无产阶级夺取和巩固政权服务，为无产阶级专政服务。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级之间的斗争，社会主义与资本主义两条道路之间的斗争，其实质，其中心，就是政权问题。无产阶级革命的中心问题，就是要夺取政权，建立无产阶级专政；无产阶级专政建立起来后，就要运用一切手段，来巩固政权，发展政权。我们目前正在进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命，矛盾、斗争的焦点也正在于：资产阶级想通过党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，实行资本主义复辟，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政；无产阶级则要巩固和发展无产阶级专政，彻底粉碎资产阶级及其在无产阶级专政内部的代表的黄粱美梦。
    我们今天纪念《讲话》，应该牢牢记住毛主席的教导：时刻不忘为工农兵、为人民大众的根本利益服务，为无产阶级专政服务。毛主席再三教导我们：革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。我们决不能以为把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派揭发批判了，就太平无事了。不，就是这次文化大革命以后，阶级敌人也决不会甘心自己的死亡，还会继续用拉出去、打进来的新花样，打入无产阶级政权的内部，等待时机，夺取政权，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。对于这一点，我们一定要千万注意，决不能丧失警惕。
    毛主席在《讲话》中还彻底地解决了文艺如何为群众服务的问题。毛主席教导我们说：文艺要为人民大众、为工农兵服务，关键就在文艺工作者“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，……”。文艺工作者要到群众中去，这不仅是为了熟悉描写对象，更重要的是为了改造自己的立场和世界观。
    毛主席的这一伟大教导，不仅是文艺工作者，而且也是革命知识分子、革命干部的行动指南。
    革命的知识分子、革命干部，在民主革命中，在社会主义革命中，以及在这次文化大革命中，都是一股十分重要、十分活跃、十分积极的力量。但是，我们千万不能忘记，只有广大的工农兵、劳动人民，才是国家的真正的主人，社会发展的真正的动力，历史上的真正的英雄，而我们自己往往是幼稚可笑的。谁脱离工农兵，脱离劳动人民，谁就要被历史所抛弃。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，一大批青年知识分子、青年干部成了革命的闯将，他们干劲足，闯劲大，政治敏感，思想活跃，最少保守思想。但是，在革命斗争中，也表现出了知识分子的一些弱点，如个人主义、无政府主义、小团体主义、山头主义等等。这些弱点正是资产阶级、小资产阶级影响的表现。阶级敌人常常利用我们人民内部的这些弱点，在革命队伍内部制造分裂。我们必须正视这些弱点，加以克服。如何克服？重要的关键，就是深入工农兵，活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的世界观。
    革命文艺工作者、革命知识分子、革命干部要和工农兵相结合，这决不是一个形式上和群众在一起的问题。深入工农兵，是要在世界观上来一个脱胎换骨的彻底的改造。在这部光辉的著作里，毛主席亲切地向我们谈到了他老人家年轻时自己感情变化的经验，说明只有经过长期的磨练，和广大群众劳动、斗争、生活、呼吸在一起，在思想感情深处真正和广大群众打成一片，才能得到真正的改造。
    我们今天纪念《讲话》，应该牢牢记住毛主席的教导，一定要学习毛主席的光辉榜样，同工农兵群众相结合，不断改造自己的世界观，永葆革命的青春。只有这样，才能使我们的政权永不变颜色，无产阶级专政永远巩固和发展。
    毛主席的这部光辉著作，永远是我们行动的指南针。我们一定要在这一光辉著作的指导下，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。我们要进一步实现无产阶级革命派的大联合，实行革命的“三结合”。要把大批判运动同本单位的斗批改结合起来，完成斗批改的伟大任务。
