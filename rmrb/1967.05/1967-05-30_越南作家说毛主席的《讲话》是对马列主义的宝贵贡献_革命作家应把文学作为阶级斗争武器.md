Vietnamese writers Huai Qing, Su Hui, and Huang Zhongtong recently published articles and gave talks, enthusiastically commemorating the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

Writer Huai Qing's article pointed out: "Chairman Mao's 'Talks' is a very valuable contribution to the treasury of Marxist-Leninist literary theory. It is even more precious to Vietnamese literary workers."

He said, "This 'Talks' is an important support for Vietnamese revolutionary literature."

Huai Qing said: "Chairman Mao seriously raised the most fundamental question of revolutionary literature, that is, the question of whom to serve."

He said: "Every time I read the 'Talks,' I gain new insights. The most profound realization I have is the issue of combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers."

Poet Huang Zhongtong in a written interview pointed out: The major problem facing literary workers is: for whom does literature serve? How does it serve? These questions "are all thoroughly and deeply resolved in this important 'Talks' from the standpoint of the proletariat."

He said: "Although the 'Talks' was published 25 years ago, it is forever new." He added: "A true revolutionary writer must use literature as a sharp weapon in the class struggle, must serve the revolutionary interests of the working class and other laboring people, and must voluntarily and consciously immerse themselves in their labor and struggle for a long time, in order to create works with both ideological power and artistic value."

Writer Su Hui in a written interview said: Chairman Mao's 'Talks' "helped me establish a creative worldview." He recalled that 20 years ago, in the harsh environment of a long war, he obtained a mimeographed translation of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." From then on, in the small backpack that accompanied him through various battlefields, Chairman Mao's 'Talks' was always carried.

Su Hui continued: "The policy of going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and learning from them, answered a series of questions I often pondered, such as why write? For whom to write?" He said: This policy helped him find the direction forward.

    越南作家说毛主席的《讲话》是对马列主义的宝贵贡献
    革命作家应把文学作为阶级斗争武器
    新华社河内二十九日电　越南作家怀青、苏怀和黄忠通最近分别发表文章和谈话，热烈纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。
    作家怀青的文章指出：“毛主席的《讲话》是对马克思列宁主义文艺理论宝库的一个非常宝贵的贡献。它对于越南的文艺工作者，则更为宝贵。”
    他说，这篇《讲话》“是对越南革命文艺的一个重要支援”。
    怀青说：“毛主席非常严肃地提出了革命文艺的非常基本的问题，那就是为谁服务的问题”。
    他说：“每次阅读（《讲话》），都有新的认识。我认识得最深刻的，就是与工农兵相结合的问题。”
    诗人黄忠通在书面谈话中指出：文艺工作者面临的大问题是：文艺为谁服务？如何服务？这些问题“都在这篇重要的《讲话》中站在无产阶级立场上详尽而深刻地解决了”。
    他说：“尽管《讲话》是在二十五年前发表的，但它永远是新的。”他接着说：“一个真正的革命作家，一定要把文学作为阶级斗争的锐利武器，必须为工人阶级和其他劳动人民的革命利益服务，必须长期和自愿自觉地深入他们的劳动和斗争生活，以便创作出具有思想威力和艺术价值的作品来。”
    作家苏怀在书面谈话中说：毛主席的《讲话》“帮助我树立了创作世界观”。他回忆说，记得二十年以前，在长期抗战的艰苦环境里，他得到了一份油印的毛泽东主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的译文。从那时候起，在陪着他走过各个战场的小小的背包里，一直装着毛主席的这篇《讲话》。
    苏怀接着说：“深入工农兵，向工农兵学习，这一方针的精神给我解答了经常思考的一系列问题，即为什么而写？为谁而写？”他说：这一方针帮助他找到了前进的方向。
