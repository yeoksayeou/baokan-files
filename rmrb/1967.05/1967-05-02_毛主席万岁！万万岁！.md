Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live Chairman Mao!

"Chairman Mao has come!"

"Chairman Mao has come!"

Our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao today came among the revolutionary masses of the capital, celebrating the international labor day of solidarity and struggle for the proletariat and laboring people of the world—May Day.

At around noon, the red sun shone brightly in the sky. Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, rode in an open-top car into the Workers' Cultural Palace. People raised high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and jumped and cheered: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Wishing Comrade Lin Biao good health! Everlasting health! Chairman Mao was radiant and full of vigor, waving his massive arms to greet everyone with festive wishes.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is your mighty hand that steers the ship of the Chinese revolution, guiding us from one victory to another!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you who personally initiated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring that our socialist state will never change color for ten thousand generations! It is you who personally wrote the most brilliant chapters in the history of the international communist movement, creating a new era of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship!

In the great decisive battle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has once again come among the revolutionary masses of the capital, greatly boosting the fighting spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin rode in an open-top car, driving towards our workers' ranks! The enthusiastic "East is Red" warriors of Factory 738 said with fighting spirit: "In the struggle between the two lines during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have always missed Chairman Mao. When we launched attacks on the capitalist roaders under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we missed Chairman Mao and felt full of energy. When we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to seize power from the capitalist roaders within the party, facing the fierce resistance of the reactionary forces, we missed Chairman Mao and gained immense courage. Today, seeing the Chairman Mao we have longed for day and night, we are even more spirited and more determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We vow to defend you, to defend your revolutionary line. Whoever dares to oppose you, we will overthrow them! For your sake, we are willing to lay down our lives and shed our blood!"

A fitter heard the crowd shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" He rushed towards the direction of the rising red sun, shouting, "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" His voice was hoarse from shouting, but he continued to cheer. Chairman Mao's open-top car had already left, but the red sun will forever rise in his mind. He immediately started composing a Shandong folk song, "We Saw Chairman Mao," to perform on the joyous night of the festival at Tiananmen Square, sharing his happiness of seeing Chairman Mao with his comrades.

The workers of the Beijing Agricultural Tools Factory, seeing the Chairman Mao they had longed for day and night, felt their blood boiling. They jumped and cheered, their eyes filled with tears of joy. They said with boundless love for Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao, we revolutionary workers have a thousand words and ten thousand words to say to you. Since you personally lit the torch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have fought fiercely and repeatedly against the capitalist roaders within the party and the reactionary capitalist line. Every time at the critical moment of the revolution, it was you who came out to support us."

They said, since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have been fighting the revolution while ensuring production, exceeding the state's production tasks. But they deeply understood that the proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all of humanity. Only by thoroughly overthrowing the capitalist roaders within the party and promoting the revolutionization of people's thoughts can they contribute to the cause of liberating all of humanity. A 40-year-old old worker, Gao Hongru, represented the aspirations of revolutionary workers: "Let the day Chairman Mao received us be the starting point for a new high tide of revolution and production. For the revolution, we fear nothing. We dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life."

A young technician from the southwestern part of the country, who came to the capital with a strong hope, finally saw Chairman Mao on this glorious day of international solidarity and struggle for the proletariat and laboring people!

He excitedly shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao!" He said, Chairman Mao's majestic and benevolent image will forever be imprinted in our minds. Chairman Mao will forever be in our hearts. Most beloved Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you in revolution, be your little red soldiers, dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, and forever be loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers who guard Chairman Mao day and night were singing "Beijing Has a Golden Sun" and "The Ship of the Sea Depends on the Helm" with the revolutionary masses of the capital when suddenly the sky was filled with radiant light. Our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, has come. The soldiers raised their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long Live Chairman Mao!" The soldiers cheered and jumped, their hearts unable to calm down for a long time. Some soldiers opened their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and solemnly recorded this unforgettable moment on the cover page; some soldiers wrote poems and articles to send to the newspaper. A soldier excitedly wrote: "We are fortunate to see Chairman Mao, and our hearts are filled with an ever-rising red sun. We want to use the forest as a pen to write down our voices: Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Times Long Live Chairman Mao! We want to use the sea as ink to describe our wishes: Long Live Chairman Mao! Eternal life! Eternal life!"

A member of the Beijing Garrison Revolutionary Committee and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Kong Xiangxiu, said to his comrades: "Today I saw Chairman Mao again, and this is my greatest happiness. Chairman Mao waved to us, as if he was calling us: You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! I joined the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, which is a good opportunity to learn from the proletarian revolutionaries. We must better respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely complete the glorious historical task of supporting the left, supporting workers, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionaries, fight together, and win together, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

The revolutionary youngsters of the Jingan Mountain Commune of Beijing Normal University said: On the day of celebrating May Day, Chairman Mao received us, which is the greatest encouragement and care for us. We promise you: The sea may dry up, and the stones may crumble, but our red hearts loyal to you will never change. We will definitely act according to your instructions: We must unite with all those who can be united. We must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. At present, we must focus on criticizing the capitalist reactionary line in the cadre issue. We not only dare to "strike down a handful" but also bravely "liberate a large area." We will also plant the great red flag of your brilliant thoughts on every inch of land in the world and turn your brilliant thoughts into the soul of all humanity.

The revolutionary youngsters of the Red Guard Propaganda Team of the Beijing Middle School Revolutionary Congress heard the good news that "Chairman Mao has come" and immediately jumped up. Chairman Mao's car came to their side, and the great leader they had longed for day and night was only a few feet away. How happy! How glorious! The youngsters cheered a thousand times and ten thousand times to Chairman Mao, their eyes filled with tears of excitement and joy. As soon as Chairman Mao left, they returned to the joyous crowd and performed many programs praising the great leader, such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "We Are Chairman Mao's Red Guards."

The revolutionary youngsters encouraged each other: We must never forget this day. We must forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, forever strive to learn Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought, becoming genuine propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, rode in an open-top car straight to Zhongshan Park.

"In eight days, we saw the great leader Chairman Mao twice, and we are truly the happiest people in the world!" The students of the Shanghai Dance School, who came to Beijing to perform the modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" for Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses of the capital, saw Chairman Mao again today in Zhongshan Park. Everyone jumped with joy and shouted in unison: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" A member of the orchestra said in the joyous crowd: "I saw Chairman Mao again, very close, and I was so happy that my heart wanted to jump out. Chairman Mao cares so much for the people, and we must listen to Chairman Mao's words, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and perform the modern ballet "White-Haired Girl" even better, forever establishing the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the ballet stage, letting the stage of revolutionary ballet shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought."

Millions of people cheered, millions of people jumped, and millions of hearts boiled! What words could express their hearts' immense excitement at this moment? "The great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!" They said, only Comrade Lin Biao's May Day inscription can best express our hearts' voices.

The soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the garrison in Beijing, who were celebrating with the revolutionary masses of the capital, said that the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven that our beloved leader Chairman Mao is the most brilliant and great. Ten thousand words cannot express our soldiers' wishes. Comrade Lin Biao's May Day inscription best expresses the common wish of our soldiers in the People's Liberation Army. In their celebration with the Red Guards and revolutionary masses, almost every time they finished a performance, they would shout with the surrounding crowd:

"Long Live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!"

Former serfs, poor herdsmen, and students from more than 20 ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Oroqen, Koreans, Mongols, and Manchus from the distant borders said with great excitement that Comrade Lin Biao's May Day inscription expressed the wish of the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in our country, which ten thousand words cannot express. They vowed to overthrow the number one capitalist roader within the party and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!

"Chairman Mao has come again!"

"Chairman Mao has come among us again!"

When millions of revolutionary masses in the capital were celebrating the festival night at Tiananmen Square and its eastern and western extensions of Chang'an Street, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, once again rode in an open-top car to the center of Tiananmen Square, into the surging sea of people. At this moment, the majestic melody of "The East is Red" echoed throughout the venue and beyond; the festive lights of ten thousand lanterns shone even brighter and more splendid. The ever-rising red sun warms the hearts of revolutionary people day and night, illuminating the direction of revolutionary people's advance. People jumped and cheered, singing in unison: "The ship of the sea depends on the helm, all things grow with the sun, dew moistens the seedlings, and revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." People talked and praised, saying in unison: Chairman Mao just celebrated the festival with us during the day and came to share the joyous night with us, Chairman Mao is so energetic and healthy, this is the greatest happiness for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world!

The news of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, celebrating the festival with the revolutionary masses of the capital excited the hearts of the people of the capital, the hearts of the people of the country, and the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world. The cheers of "Long Live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!" echoed throughout Beijing, throughout China, and throughout the world.

The revolutionary masses of the capital enthusiastically celebrated May Day, the International Labor Day.

专栏：

    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    “毛主席来了！”
    “毛主席来了！”
    我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席，今天来到首都革命群众中间，同首都三百万革命群众一起，欢度全世界无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗的节日——“五一”国际劳动节。
    十二时多，红太阳当空照，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志以及中央其他负责同志，乘坐敞篷汽车驶进劳动人民文化宫。人们高举起红彤彤的《毛主席语录》纵情跳跃欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！祝愿林彪同志身体健康！永远健康！毛主席红光满面，精神焕发，挥动着那巨大的手臂，向大家致节日祝贺。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您那掌握着中国革命航船之舵的巨手，引导我们从胜利走向新的胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您亲手发动的无产阶级文化大革命，保证了我国社会主义江山千秋万代不变色！是您亲手在书写国际共产主义运动史上最光辉的篇章，开创了无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的新纪元！
    在无产阶级文化大革命的大决战中，毛主席又来到了首都革命群众之中，极大地鼓舞了无产阶级革命派奋战不息的昂扬斗志。
    毛主席和林副主席乘坐的敞篷汽车驶过来了，驶向我们工人队伍中来了！满怀战斗豪情的七三八厂“东方红”战士激动地说：“在无产阶级文化大革命的两条路线斗争中，我们一直想念着毛主席。当我们在毛主席的革命路线光辉指引下，向资产阶级反动路线发起攻击的时候，我们想念着毛主席，我们感到浑身是劲。当我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，向我厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起自下而上夺权，遭到反动势力的疯狂抵抗的时候，我们想念着毛主席，我们就增添了无比的勇气。今天，我们见到了日夜想念的毛主席，更加斗志昂扬，更加坚定了把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们誓死保卫您，保卫您的革命路线。谁胆敢反对您，我们打倒谁！为了保卫您，我们不惜抛头颅、洒热血！”
    一个钳工听到人海里欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”连忙向红太阳升起的地方奔去，“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”他嗓子都嘶哑了还是一个劲地欢呼，他终于见到了毛主席。毛主席乘坐的敞篷汽车已经离去，红太阳在他脑中永远升起。他当场开始创作山东快书《我们见到了毛主席》，要在节日的狂欢之夜在天安门广场演出，同自己的战友分享见到毛主席的幸福。
    北京农具厂的工人见到了心中日夜想念的毛主席，浑身热血沸腾，一边跳跃，一边欢呼，激动的泪花模糊了眼睛。他们怀着对毛主席无限热爱的激情说：毛主席呀毛主席，我们革命工人有千言万语要向您老人家说。自从您老人家亲自点燃起无产阶级文化大革命的火炬时起，我们就和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，和资产阶级反动路线，做过激烈反复的斗争。每到革命的关键时刻，总是您老人家出来支持我们。
    他们说，无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们工人一边闹革命，一边坚持搞生产，超额完成了国家生产任务。但是，我们深深懂得，无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己，只有彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，只有促使人的思想革命化，才能给解放全人类的事业做出贡献。四十多岁的老工人高洪儒代表了革命工人的心愿说：把毛主席接见我们的这个难忘的日子，作为我们掀起抓革命、促生产新高潮的起点，为了革命我们什么也不怕，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，跟毛主席闹一辈子革命。
    从祖国的西南来到首都的一位青年技术人员，怀着一个无比强烈的希望，希望见到毛主席。在这世界无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗的光辉节日里，他终于见到毛主席了！
    他激动地直喊“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”他说，毛主席魁伟、慈祥的形象，永远永远地印在我们的脑子里。毛主席永远和我们心连心。最最敬爱的毛主席，我们一定永远永远跟着您闹革命，做您的红小兵，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，永远忠实于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    日夜守卫在毛主席身边的战士们，正同首都无产阶级革命派一起高声歌唱《北京有个金太阳》、《大海航行靠舵手》的时候，突然霞光万丈，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席来了。战士们举着红彤彤的《语录》，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”战士们欢呼啊，跳跃啊，心情久久平静不下来，有的战士打开《毛主席语录》本，在扉页上庄重地记下了这个难忘的时刻；有的战士提笔写诗著文，写给报社。一个战士激动地写道：“我们幸福地见到毛主席，我们心中升起了永远不落的红太阳。我们要森林作笔，用来书写我们的心声：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！我们要大海当墨，用来描绘我们的祝愿：毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    北京卫戍区学习毛主席著作积极分子、北京市革命委员会委员孔祥秀向战友们说：“今天我又见到了毛主席，这是我最大的幸福。毛主席他老人家向我们招手，好象他老人家又在号召我们：你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我参加了北京市革命委员会，这是向无产阶级革命派学习的好机会。我们一定更好地响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训这项光荣的历史任务，坚定地和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    北京师范大学井冈山公社的革命小将说：在欢度“五一”国际劳动节的日子里，毛主席，您老人家会见了我们，这是对我们的最大鼓舞、最大关怀。我们向您保证：海可枯，石可烂，忠于您的红心永不变。我们坚决照您的指示办事：要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。当前，我们要着重批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，我们不但敢于“打击一小撮”，而且勇于“解放一大片”。我们还要把您老人家光辉思想的伟大红旗插遍全世界每一寸土地，把您的光辉思想化为全人类的灵魂。
    北京中学红代会毛泽东思想宣传队的革命小将们，听到“毛主席来了”的好消息，马上跳了起来。毛主席乘坐的汽车一下来到他们身边，日夜渴望的伟大领袖离他们只有几尺远了。多么幸福！多么光荣！小将们千遍万遍地向毛主席欢呼，激动的、喜悦的眼泪流了满面。毛主席刚刚离去，他们就回到欢乐的人群中，再一次演出了歌颂伟大领袖的《万岁！毛主席！》《我们是毛主席的红卫兵》等许多节目。
    革命小将们互相勉励说：我们永远不能忘记这个日子。我们一定要永远跟着毛主席干革命，永远努力学习毛泽东思想，热情宣传毛泽东思想，坚决贯彻毛泽东思想，勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，做名副其实的毛泽东思想宣传员。
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志乘坐的敞篷汽车，又直驶中山公园来了。
    “在八天之内，我们两次见到了伟大领袖毛主席，我们真是世界上最幸福的人！”专程来到北京向毛主席和首都革命群众演出现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的上海市舞蹈学校的同学，今天在中山公园又一次见到了毛主席，大家高兴得跳了起来，一连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”一位乐队队员在欢乐的人群中说：“我又看到了毛主席，离得很近，我高兴得心都要蹦出来了。毛主席这样关心群众，我们一定要听毛主席的话，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，要把现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》演得好上加好，要永远把工农兵的形象树立在芭蕾舞台上，让革命的芭蕾舞台上放射出毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。”
    千万人在欢呼，千万人在跳跃，千万人的心在沸腾！此刻一句什么样的话才能表达他们这无比激动的心声？“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们说，只有林彪同志的这个“五一”节题词最能表达我们的心声。
    同首都革命群众一起联欢的驻京部队某部毛泽东思想宣传队的战士们说，无产阶级文化大革命实践证明，敬爱的领袖毛主席就是最英明、最伟大，千言万语也表达不尽我们战士这一心愿。林彪同志“五一”节题词最好地表达了我们解放军战士的一个共同心愿。他们在和红卫兵革命小将、和革命群众的联欢中，几乎每演完一个节目，都要同周围群众同声欢呼：
    “毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    过去的农奴、贫苦牧民以及来自遥远边疆的藏族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族、鄂伦春族、朝鲜族、蒙族、满族等二十多个民族的学生无比振奋地说，林彪同志“五一”节题词把我国各族革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席千言万语也表达不尽的心愿说了出来。他们表示决心要把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒、斗臭，永远跟着毛主席干革命！
    “毛主席又来了！”
    “毛主席又来到我们中间了！”
    当首都百万革命群众在天安门广场及其两翼的东西长安街上，欢度节日之夜的时候，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，又一次乘坐敞篷汽车来到天安门广场的中央，来到欢腾不已的人海之中。这时，《东方红》的雄壮乐曲声，响彻全场，响彻四方；节日的万盏华灯，显得更加明亮，显得更加辉煌。永远不落的红太阳，日日夜夜温暖着革命人民的心房，照亮着革命人民前进的方向。人们跳跃着，欢呼着，一齐放声歌唱：“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。”人们交谈着，传颂着，异口同声地说：毛主席白天刚同我们一起欢度节日，晚上又来同我们共度狂欢之夜，毛主席精力这样充沛，身体这样健康，这真是中国人民和世界革命人民最大的幸福！
    毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志同首都人民一起欢度节日的喜讯，激动着首都人民的心，激动着全国人民的心，激动着世界革命人民的心。“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声，响遍北京，响遍全中国，响遍全世界。　（新华社一日讯）（附图片）
