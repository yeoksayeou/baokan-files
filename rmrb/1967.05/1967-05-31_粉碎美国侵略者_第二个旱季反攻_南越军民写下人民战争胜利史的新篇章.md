The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam fought brilliantly in the dry season battles from last winter to this spring, shattering the so-called "second dry season offensive" launched by the U.S. aggressors with great effort. They annihilated a large number of the enemy's forces, adding a new chapter to the history of the Vietnamese people's war of liberation.

In this dry season (from last November to this May), the South Vietnamese Liberation Army, local forces, and guerrilla units fought valiantly on all fronts, achieving even more brilliant victories than in the previous dry season. According to incomplete statistics, the South Vietnamese military and civilians annihilated more than ten thousand enemy troops in the past half year.

This brilliant victory of the South Vietnamese military and civilians shows that the people of South Vietnam, who persist in the people's war, not only can withstand the massive counteroffensive of more than forty thousand U.S. troops, more than fifty thousand mercenaries, and more than fifty thousand puppet troops but can also defeat the enemy.

Dragging out the enemy, annihilating the enemy's forces

In this dry season, the brave and skilled military and civilian people of South Vietnam held onto the crazed U.S. aggressors who were conducting "sweeps," dragging them until they were exhausted, and then seizing the opportunity to strike fiercely, annihilating a large number of the enemy's forces.

To avoid being dragged out and defeated by the military and civilian people of South Vietnam, the U.S. aggressors desperately increased their troops in this dry season. They also deployed more than twice the number of troops compared to the previous dry season, launching massive "sweeps" on the West Ninh Province and the surrounding areas of Saigon, and on the Central Highlands region and other liberated areas. Each "sweep" involved more than ten thousand U.S. troops, hundreds of aircraft, and hundreds of armored vehicles.

From February 22 to April 10, over forty days, the military and civilian people of West Ninh Province consecutively shattered three large-scale "sweeps" launched by the U.S. aggressors, annihilating more than ten thousand enemy troops. In the anti-"sweep" battles, the liberation armed forces of West Ninh Province used the strategies and tactics of people's war, continuously harassing and striking the enemy. They dispersed at times, concentrated at others, ambushed at times, and launched sudden attacks at others. In many battles, the liberation armed forces fought brilliantly, annihilating entire companies and battalions of the enemy in just a few hours or even tens of minutes.

In the Central region, the enemy was met with a fierce counterattack as soon as the dry season began. From last November to this March, the liberation armed forces annihilated more than sixty-six thousand enemy troops, including more than thirty-four thousand U.S. aggressors and more than four thousand South Korean mercenaries, successfully defending the liberated areas. The liberation armed forces active in the southern part of the demilitarized zone in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region launched powerful offensives against the enemy starting in March, concentrating their forces to achieve quick victories, annihilating a large number of enemy troops, and causing the U.S. aggressors to panic. They hastily withdrew more than ten thousand U.S. troops from the West Ninh battlefield and other fronts to reinforce their defenses. The liberation armed forces in other areas also fiercely attacked and annihilated the enemy.

Widely conducting guerrilla warfare, accumulating small victories into big ones

During the dry season, while fiercely annihilating the enemy, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam also developed people's guerrilla warfare to a new level.

Guerrilla units and local forces in various places cooperated with the main forces, fighting well and cleverly, making significant contributions to shattering the enemy's hundreds of large and small "sweeps." Often, as soon as the enemy moved out or invaded the liberated areas, they were first attacked by the guerrilla units and local forces. They continuously launched attacks, tying down a large number of the enemy's forces, and gradually annihilating the enemy, accumulating small victories into big ones. The local forces, which have rapidly grown in the battles, have generally been able to annihilate entire companies and battalions of the enemy.

Guerrilla units and local forces also proactively cooperated with the main forces, appearing suddenly in the enemy's rear, eliminating enemy strongholds heavily guarded by troops; shelling the enemy's military headquarters and command systems; infiltrating cities for armed attacks; and destroying the enemy's water and land transportation, making the enemy vulnerable from both front and rear, unable to cope, and struggling to respond. In just a few months, important U.S. military bases were attacked more than fifty times. The important strategic transportation lines temporarily controlled by the enemy have been paralyzed due to frequent cuts and sabotage by guerrilla units. In the past few months, more than fifty enemy military vessels have been sunk or damaged in some major waterways of the Mekong Delta. The enemy no longer has a safe rear; the flames of people's guerrilla warfare have burned the U.S. aggressors, mercenaries, and puppet troops, making them desperate and unable to sleep peacefully.

Bravely fighting, the U.S. "steel advantage" fails

The heavily armed U.S. aggressors arrogantly attempted to use their "steel and firepower advantage" to reverse the situation. In this dry season, the U.S. aggressors invested one to three times more aircraft, military vehicles, and artillery than in the previous dry season, using almost all modern weapons except nuclear weapons. However, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam elevated the human factor to a new height. They highly demonstrated their wisdom and bravery, creating records for killing and injuring the enemy and destroying the enemy's various combat tools. The heroic military and civilian people of West Ninh Province used ordinary and homemade weapons. From February 2 to April 13, in the anti-"sweep" battles, they annihilated two U.S. infantry battalions, two artillery battalions, five artillery companies, and nine armored battalions; among them, they destroyed eight hundred and one tanks and armored vehicles. Additionally, they shot down one hundred and sixty-nine enemy aircraft and destroyed more than ninety enemy heavy artillery pieces. In the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region, the Central Highlands, and other battlefields, the liberation armed forces, whose weapons were inferior to the enemy's, defeated the U.S. aggressors who used "helicopter tactics," "armored vehicle tactics," and "artillery tactics," achieving brilliant victories. This is a new glorious victory of "the human factor first," which once again declares the shameful failure of the U.S. weaponry advocates.

### 粉碎美国侵略者“第二个旱季反攻”  南越军民写下人民战争胜利史的新篇章

    粉碎美国侵略者“第二个旱季反攻”
    南越军民写下人民战争胜利史的新篇章
    据新华社讯　本社记者述评：英雄的越南南方军民在去冬今春的旱季战斗中，打得非常出色，粉碎了美国侵略强盗费尽九牛二虎之力发动的所谓“第二个旱季反攻”，歼灭了敌人的大量有生力量，给越南人民战争胜利史上增添了新的篇章。
    在这个旱季（从去年十一月到今年五月）中，越南南方解放军、地方部队和游击队在各个战线上纵横驰骋，勇猛杀敌，取得了比前一个旱季更加辉煌的胜利。据不完全统计，南越军民这半年多里，共歼灭敌人十多万名。
    南越军民这个辉煌胜利，说明坚持人民战争的越南南方军民，不仅能够顶得住四十多万美军、五万多帮凶军和五十多万伪军的大反扑，而且完全能够打败敌人。
    拖垮敌人，猛歼敌人有生力量
    在这个旱季中，英勇善战的越南南方军民对疯狂进行“扫荡”的美国强盗拖住不放，拖得敌人精疲力竭，然后寻找有利战机猛打猛歼，吃掉敌人的大量有生力量。
    美国侵略者为了逃避被越南南方军民拖垮拖死的命运，在这个旱季里拚命增兵，同时出动比上一个旱季多一倍以上的兵力，疯狂地向西贡西北的西宁省和西贡周围，向中部高原地区等解放区发动大规模的“扫荡”。每次“扫荡”都有上万名美军参加，数百架飞机和数百辆战车出动。
    在从二月二十二日到四月十日的四十多天中，西宁省军民接连粉碎美国强盗发动的三次大规模“扫荡”，共歼灭敌人一万多名。在反“扫荡”战斗中，西宁省解放武装力量运用人民战争的战略战术，不断围扰和打击敌人。他们时而分散，时而集中，时而伏击，时而突然袭击。许多次战斗，解放武装力量都打得非常漂亮，几个小时甚至几十分钟内，就把敌人打得落花流水，整连整营地把敌人吃掉。
    在中部地区，旱季一开始，敌人就遭到了迎头痛击。从去年十一月到今年三月，解放武装力量共歼灭敌人六万六千多名，其中包括美国侵略军三万四千多名和南朝鲜帮凶军四千多名，胜利地保卫了解放区。活跃在非军事区南侧的广治—承天地区的解放武装力量，三月份以来不断向敌人发动强大攻势，集中兵力速战速决，歼灭大量敌人，使美国强盗慌了手脚，急忙从西宁等战场抽调一万多名美军前来救援。其他各地解放武装力量也揪住敌人猛打猛歼。
    广泛开展游击战，积小胜为大胜
    旱季里，越南南方军民在猛歼敌人的同时，还把人民游击战争发展到一个新的水平。
    各地游击队和地方部队配合主力部队，打得好，打得巧，为粉碎敌人发动的数以百计的大小“扫荡”，作出了巨大的贡献。常常是敌人刚刚出动或侵入解放区，就首先被游击队和地方部队咬住。他们不断发动袭击，牵制住敌人的大量兵力，并一口一口吃掉敌人，积小胜为大胜。在战斗里迅速成长的地方部队，已经普遍地能够整连整营地消灭敌人。
    游击队和地方部队还主动配合主力部队，神出鬼没地出现在敌人的后方，拔除敌人重兵防守的据点；炮轰敌人的军事首脑机构和指挥系统；潜入城镇进行武装袭击；破坏敌人的水陆交通，使敌人腹背挨打，顾此失彼，穷于应付。在短短的几个月内，美军重要基地共被袭击五十多次。敌人暂时控制的重要战略交通线，由于经常被游击队切断和破坏，已处于瘫痪状态。近几个月来，在湄公河三角洲的一些主要河道上，已有五十多艘敌军舰艇被击沉击伤。敌人已经没有安全的后方，人民游击战争的烈火，已把美国强盗、帮凶军和伪军烧得焦头烂额，朝不保夕。
    勇敢战斗，美帝钢铁“优势”失灵
    武装到牙齿的美国强盗，狂妄地企图利用钢铁和火力“优势”来挽回败局。在这个旱季中，美国侵略者投入了比上一个旱季多一到三倍的飞机、军用车辆和大炮，把原子武器以外的各种现代化武器几乎都用上了。但是越南南方军民把人的因素发挥到新的高度。他们高度发扬机智勇敢精神，创造打死打伤敌人和击毁敌人各种作战工具的最高纪录。英雄的西宁省军民使用普通武器和土造武器，单在二月二日到四月十三日的反“扫荡”战斗中，就全歼美军两个步兵营、两个炮兵营、五个炮兵连和九个装甲营；其中击毁的坦克和装甲车达八百零一辆。另外还击落敌机一百六十九架，摧毁敌人重炮九十多门。在广治—承天地区、中部高原和其他战场，武器落后于敌人的解放武装力量，却打败了使用“直升飞机战术”、“装甲车战术”、“炮兵战术”的美国强盗，取得了辉煌胜利。这是“人的因素第一”的一次新的光辉胜利，它再一次宣告了美国唯武器论者的可耻破产。
