One year ago, our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world.

On May 16, 1966, the highest command of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao issued the "Notice on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," completely shattering the counter-revolutionary "Draft Report" of the Peng Zhen revisionist clique and exposing the dark curtain of the biggest handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

This "Notice," personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is a great historical document of epoch-making significance. It sounded the charge for the great proletarian cultural revolution. It proposed the theory, line, policy, and guidelines for the great proletarian cultural revolution, pointed out the general direction of the struggle, and put forward the great strategic task. It is our proletarian revolutionary faction's beacon. Together with Chairman Mao's series of instructions, it solved the fundamental problem of carrying out revolution and preventing capitalist restoration under the dictatorship of the proletariat. For one year, we have closely followed our great helmsman Chairman Mao, advanced along the revolutionary line of the proletariat, and achieved continuous victories.

The "Notice" points out: "Those in authority taking the capitalist road at the highest level of the party and the government are themselves a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists and agents of the bourgeoisie. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." Therefore, our struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road is a life-and-death class struggle. Our relationship with them can only be one of a class oppressing another class, that is, the proletariat exercising dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, and cannot be any other kind of relationship.

I and the young revolutionary pioneers of our State Science and Technology Commission have, since last May, actively participated in the great proletarian cultural revolution. We have firmly grasped the general direction indicated by Chairman Mao and launched a fierce struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

One year of revolutionary practice has educated us, and we have increasingly deeply felt that all class struggles are political struggles. This struggle, in a nutshell, is about the proletariat and the bourgeoisie contending for political power.

The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road aim to restore capitalism and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat to establish the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. If the leadership of our scientific and technological circles falls into their hands, our science and technology can only serve their bourgeois politics and cannot possibly serve the politics of the proletariat. Therefore, the purpose of our proletarian revolutionary faction's struggle is to overthrow the bourgeois representatives entrenched in the field of science and technology. The proletariat must seize the leadership of the field of science and technology.

For one year, thunder roared, and victory songs resounded. Looking back at our magnificent battle journey over the past year and the glorious victories we have achieved, our hearts are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm. We will never forget that our great leader Chairman Mao has given us tremendous support and strength at every critical moment, shown us the way, led us to break through countless stormy waves and rapids, and achieved one victory after another.

After one year of arduous struggle, we have exposed the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists hidden within the State Science and Technology Commission and seized back all the power they had usurped into the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. On the evening of May 1, our great leader Chairman Mao encouraged us on Tiananmen Gate to seize power well. This is the greatest encouragement and spur for us proletarian revolutionaries from our great leader Chairman Mao!

We will definitely resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, fight together, and resolutely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. We will carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

    一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争
    国家科委革命委员会主任　张本
    一年前，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。
    一九六六年五月十六日，以毛主席为首的无产阶级最高司令部，发出了关于无产阶级文化大革命的《通知》，彻底粉碎了彭真修正主义集团的反革命《汇报提纲》，揭开了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的黑幕。
    由毛主席亲自主持制定的这个《通知》，是一个具有划时代意义的伟大的历史文件。这个文件，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。这个文件，提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，指明了斗争的大方向，提出了伟大的战略任务。这个文件是我们无产阶级革命派的指路明灯。它和毛主席的一系列指示，解决了无产阶级专政条件下进行革命和防止资本主义复辟的根本问题。一年来，我们紧跟着我们伟大统帅毛主席，沿着无产阶级的革命路线，不断胜利前进。
    《通知》指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”因此，我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，我们对他们的关系，只能是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级实行专政的关系，而不能是什么别的关系。
    我和我们国家科委的青年革命闯将在一起，从去年五月开始，就积极投入了无产阶级文化大革命。我们紧紧掌握住毛主席指引的大方向，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了猛烈的斗争。
    一年来的革命实践教育了我们，我们愈来愈深刻地体会到一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争。这个斗争集中到一点，就是无产阶级和资产阶级争夺政权的问题。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的目的就是要复辟资本主义，就是要推翻无产阶级专政，实现资产阶级专政。如果我国科技界的领导权掌握在他们的手里，我们的科学技术就只能为他们的资产阶级政治服务，而不可能为无产阶级的政治服务。所以我们无产阶级革命派斗争的目的，就是要打倒盘踞在科学技术领域中的资产阶级代表人物。无产阶级一定要夺取科学技术领域的领导权。
    一年来，风雷滚滚，凯歌阵阵。回顾我们一年来所经历的豪迈的战斗历程，回顾我们一年来取得的光辉胜利，心里充满了革命豪情。我们永远不能忘记，伟大领袖毛主席在每个紧要关头给了我们巨大的支持和力量，给我们指明了航向，率领我们冲破了无数惊涛骇浪，冲破了重重激流险滩，取得了一个又一个胜利。
    经过一年艰苦的斗争，我们揪出了隐藏在国家科委内的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，把他们篡夺的一切大权，夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。今年五月一日晚上，我们的伟大领袖毛主席在天安门城楼上勉励我们夺权夺得好。这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们无产阶级革命派最大的鼓舞和鞭策！
    我们一定坚决听毛主席的话，和广大革命群众团结在一起，斗争在一起，坚决捍卫无产阶级专政，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
