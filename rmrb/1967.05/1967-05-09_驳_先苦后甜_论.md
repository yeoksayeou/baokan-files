The top capitalist-roader in the Party actively advocates the so-called "suffer first, enjoy later" theory. In his view, a revolutionary enduring some "hardship" in the struggle is to shoulder a "great responsibility," to enjoy the fruits of victory later. "Suffering first" is for the sake of "enjoying later." Having endured hardship in the past and enjoying some comfort now is only natural; the more hardship endured in the past, the more comfort enjoyed now, which is also quite reasonable.

According to the logic of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, proletarian revolutionaries, after achieving victory in the revolution, can change their proletarian nature, can indulge in pleasure, can consider themselves heroes, can detach themselves from the masses, and can become officials and lords.

The "suffer first, enjoy later" theory advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party is no different from the extreme individualism propagated by the feudal ruling class, which says, "Endure the hardest hardships to become a person of high status."

The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates the "suffer first, enjoy later" theory to make proletarian revolutionaries compete for fame, position, power, and personal gain. He wants to subtly influence us with the idea of personal fame, position, comfort, and enjoyment later, to make us undergo a "peaceful evolution."

The proletarian revolution is a revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie by the proletariat, aiming to end the evil history of man exploiting man and man oppressing man on this earth. Our great leader Chairman Mao often teaches us: The proletariat can only finally liberate itself by liberating all mankind. Before the proletariat achieves the liberation of all mankind, for the liberation of class brothers, it has the duty and responsibility to endure hardships and sacrifices without fear, to struggle to the end. What the proletariat pursues should be the liberation of all mankind, should be the final liberation of the proletariat along with the liberation of all mankind. It is absolutely not for personal "enjoyment later," for personal "great responsibility," or for personal happiness.

A true proletarian revolutionary always absolutely places himself in the position of striving hard for the people's interests. The great communist warrior Lei Feng, to support agricultural production, donated more than one hundred yuan he had saved from his daily frugal living to the people's commune. Chairman Mao's good student Jiao Yulu, to conquer the three disasters of Lanzhou, endured severe liver pain, explored floods, and chased sandstorms. The heroes of the 32111 drilling team, for the construction of socialism, decided to fight on the drilling platform while alive and be buried under the gas well after death.... If Dong Cunrui had sought personal "enjoyment later," he would not have carried the explosive package to blow up the fortress; if Huang Jiguang had sought personal "enjoyment later," he would not have used his body to block the gun port; if Wang Jie had sought personal "enjoyment later," he would not have dived forward in the instant the landmine was about to explode...

Regarding "enjoyment," the proletariat has always recognized it this way: Revolution is "enjoyment." Struggling, enduring hardships, and sacrificing oneself for the liberation of all the people in China and the world is the greatest happiness, is the greatest "enjoyment." Enduring the hardships of revolution means tasting the "enjoyment" of revolution. Therefore, for proletarian revolutionaries, there is absolutely no such thing as "suffer first, enjoy later."

After proletarian revolutionaries seize power, when their political and economic status changes, the proletarian nature of the working people remains unchanged, the identity of an ordinary worker remains unchanged, the duty of being a servant of the people remains unchanged, and the style of connecting with the masses remains unchanged. The more the revolutionary cause develops, the more determined their thought of revolution to the end becomes, the deeper their proletarian feelings become, and the more their spirit of hard struggle is promoted.

The "suffer first, enjoy later" theory advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party is to make us forget the past hardships, forget the current living standards of the people, forget the billions of class brothers who have not been liberated in the world, and pursue personal enjoyment and personal fame, position, and gain; it is to turn us into revisionists and lead our country onto the road of capitalist restoration.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: After winning the nation, we must be vigilant against the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie and must "continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." The "suffer first, enjoy later" theory propagated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party is a genuine "sugar-coated bullet." We must thoroughly refute the "suffer first, enjoy later" theory!

    驳“先苦后甜”论
    解放军某部班长　王润刚
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，积极鼓吹所谓“先苦后甜”论。在他看来，一个革命者在斗争中吃点“苦”，就是为了担当“大任”，就是为了胜利后的享受。“先苦”就是为了“后甜”。过去吃点“苦”，现在享点福，是天经地义的；过去“苦”吃得越多，现在福享得越大，也理所当然。
    按照党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的逻辑，无产阶级革命者在取得革命胜利以后，就可以改变劳动人民本色，就可以贪图享乐，就可以功臣自居，就可以脱离人民群众，就可以当官做老爷了。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派积极鼓吹的“先苦后甜”论，同封建统治阶级所宣扬的“吃得苦中苦，方为人上人”的极端利己主义，如出一辙。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“先苦后甜”论，就是要我们无产阶级革命者为个人争名、争位、争权、争利，用个人名利地位、安逸享乐的“后甜”，对我们潜移默化，让我们“和平演变”。
    无产阶级革命，是无产阶级推翻资产阶级的革命，是要在地球上结束人剥削人、人压迫人的罪恶历史的革命。伟大领袖毛主席经常教导我们：无产阶级只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己。无产阶级在没有取得全人类解放的时候，为了阶级兄弟的解放，有义务有责任不避艰苦，不怕牺牲，奋斗到底。无产阶级所追求的，应该是全人类的解放，应该是随着全人类的解放而获得无产阶级的最后解放。而绝不是为了个人的“后甜”，为了个人的担当“大任”，为了个人的幸福。
    一个真正的无产阶级革命者，始终地绝对地把自己放在为人民的利益而艰苦奋斗的位置上。伟大的共产主义战士雷锋，为了支援农业生产，把自己平时省吃俭用积蓄的一百多元钱，捐给了人民公社。毛主席的好学生焦裕禄，为了制服兰考三害，忍着剧烈的肝痛，探洪水，追流沙。三二一一一钻井队的英雄们，为了社会主义建设，决心活着就奋战在井台上，死了就埋在气井下。……如果董存瑞为了个人的“后甜”，就不可能手托药包炸碉堡；如果黄继光为了个人的“后甜”，就不可能用身体堵枪眼；如果王杰为了个人的“后甜”，就不可能在地雷即将爆炸的一瞬间向前一扑……
    对于“甜”，无产阶级从来就是这样认识：革命就是“甜”。为了全中国、全世界人民解放而斗争，而吃苦，而献身，这就是最大的幸福，这就是最大的“甜”。吃革命的苦，就尝到了革命的“甜”。所以，对于无产阶级革命者来说，根本无所谓什么“先苦后甜”。
    无产阶级革命者在取得政权以后，在政治地位和经济地位发生变化的时候，劳动人民的本色始终不变，普通劳动者的身分始终不变，当人民勤务员的职责始终不变，联系人民群众的作风始终不变。革命的事业越发展，他们革命到底的思想就越坚定，无产阶级的感情就越深厚，艰苦奋斗的精神就越发扬。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的“先苦后甜”论，就是要我们忘记过去的苦难日子，忘记现在的人民生活水平，忘记世界上没有解放的亿万阶级兄弟，而追求个人享乐，计较个人名利地位；就是要把我们演变成为修正主义分子，把我们的国家引上资本主义复辟的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：在夺取全国胜利以后，一定要警惕资产阶级的糖衣炮弹，一定要“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所宣扬的“先苦后甜”论，就是一颗地地道道的“糖衣炮弹”。我们必须把“先苦后甜”论彻底批倒！
