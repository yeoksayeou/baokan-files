The people of all nationalities across the country enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the _Communiqué_ by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the _Great Historical Document_

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary rebels, and workers, peasants, and soldiers of all nationalities across the country, with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the _Communiqué_ by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the important article _Great Historical Document_ by the editorial departments of _Red Flag_ magazine and the _People's Daily_. They enthusiastically celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and the glorious victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They unanimously declare that they will, in light of the new situation in the current struggle, seriously study and further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They will expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated various fields, and fight them until they are thoroughly discredited, overthrown, and defeated. They will complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions and units, and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

After the publication of the _Communiqué_ by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the broad masses of revolutionaries in cities and countryside across the country celebrated with drums and gongs, and the joyous shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" echoed across the land. Revolutionaries across the country held celebration meetings, discussion meetings, and parades, and posted notices and big-character posters, vowing to seriously study, resolutely implement, and enthusiastically propagate this great historical document. They unanimously acclaimed the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They pointed out that Chairman Mao has, in theory and practice, solved the problem of conducting a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. He has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism. This is a great milestone in the history of Marxism.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries across the country reviewed the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution over the past year and unanimously agreed that, at this crucial moment of the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines, the publication of the _Communiqué_ has great historical and practical significance. This has made the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries proud and has struck fear into the hearts of all class enemies at home and abroad. They said that, under the guidance of the _Communiqué_ by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, we have exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and we have exposed the Peng Dehuai anti-revolutionary revisionist clique. We have smashed their plot to restore capitalism, and this is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. They felt a great sense of pride and intimacy as they reviewed Chairman Mao's wise teachings in the _Communiqué_, and they were filled with boundless fighting spirit. They declared that they would definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance victoriously, and defend to the death the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They would carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

As the broad masses of revolutionaries studied the _Communiqué_ by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the important article _Great Historical Document_ by the editorial departments of _Red Flag_ magazine and the _People's Daily_, they repeatedly pondered the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: the outcome of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, the restoration of capitalism is possible at any time. All Party members and the people of the entire country should not assume that one, two, three, or four Cultural Revolutions will ensure lasting peace. We must be extremely vigilant and never let our guard down. They said: the class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat boils down to the question of power. After the proletariat seizes power, no matter how complex the problems they encounter, they must not forget the direction and lose sight of the center. They must never forget class struggle and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. They must never forget the bourgeoisie and the most harmful elements who have infiltrated the Party and the leadership organs of the state and are taking the capitalist road. It is precisely these elements who are constantly attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and turn it into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, leading our great socialist country towards the restoration of capitalism. The great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven how great, wise, and correct Chairman Mao's scientific judgments in this great historical document are!

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary cadres joyfully declared that Chairman Mao's wise judgments have pointed out the direction of our struggle for the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries across the country. They have inspired us to expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to expose the revisionist elements who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles. We have brought out their revisionist goods for public display, fought them until they were thoroughly discredited, overthrown, and defeated, and waged a struggle to seize power, achieving extremely great victories. However, the bourgeoisie will not voluntarily leave the historical stage. Now that we have exposed a batch of anti-revolutionary revisionist elements and their backers, it is possible that another batch of bourgeois representatives will take the stage. We must not relax our vigilance for a moment. The proletarian revolutionaries must forever engrave the six shining golden characters of the dictatorship of the proletariat in their hearts and minds.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary cadres across the country, while enthusiastically acclaiming the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, declared that they would firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage, and one should not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." They declared that they would definitely firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, actively promote revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the struggle of criticism, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. They said, our victory is only the first step of a long march of ten thousand li, and the road ahead is still long, with even more arduous tasks. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao, further understand and grasp the theories, lines, policies, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, and thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road from political, ideological, and theoretical perspectives. We will also combine the great criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our respective regions and units, and successfully complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We will also better "grasp revolution and promote production," and make the various undertakings of socialist construction even more prosperous.

    全国各族人民热烈欢呼中共中央《通知》和《伟大的历史文件》发表
    无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争还是政权问题
    广大革命群众反复领会毛主席的伟大教导：现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
    新华社十八日讯　全国各地各族广大工农兵、革命小将、革命干部怀着无比高昂的革命豪情，最热烈地欢呼中共中央《通知》和《红旗》杂志编辑部、《人民日报》编辑部重要文章《伟大的历史文件》的发表，热烈庆祝中央文革小组成立一周年和无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。他们一致表示要结合当前斗争的新形势，认真学习，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和混进各个领域的资产阶级代表人物揭露出来，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，胜利完成本地区、本单位的斗批改任务，夺取文化大革命的新胜利。
    中共中央《通知》发表以后，各地广大城乡锣鼓喧天，凯歌阵阵，“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻祖国大地。各地革命群众纷纷举行庆祝大会、座谈会和游行，张贴喜报、大字报，决心认真学习、坚决执行、热情宣传这个伟大的历史文件，同声欢呼毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们指出，毛主席在理论上、实践上解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的问题，创造性的发展了马克思列宁主义。这是马克思主义发展史上一个伟大的里程碑。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派回顾了一年来文化大革命的伟大成果，一致认为在当前两个阶级、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，《通知》的公开发表，具有伟大的历史意义和现实意义。这使广大无产阶级革命派扬眉吐气，使国内外一切阶级敌人胆战心惊。他们说，一年来在中共中央《通知》的指引下，我们把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了，把彭真反革命修正主义集团揪出来了，粉碎了他们妄图实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们在重温毛主席在《通知》中的英明教导，感到无比自豪、无比亲切，浑身充满了无穷的战斗力量。他们表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜乘胜前进，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓死保卫无产阶级专政，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    广大革命群众在学习中共中央《通知》和《红旗》杂志编辑部、《人民日报》编辑部重要文章《伟大的历史文件》时，反复地领会了我们伟大领袖毛主席的伟大教导：革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。他们说：无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是政权问题。无产阶级在夺取政权以后，遇到的问题无论怎样千头万绪，决不能忘记了方向，失掉了中心，千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能忘记无产阶级专政。千万不能忘记资产阶级和危害最大的混进党和政权领导机关内部的走资本主义道路当权派。正是他们无时无刻不在妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，妄图把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，把我们伟大的社会主义国家引向资本主义复辟。一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，证明了毛主席在这个伟大历史文件中作出的科学论断是何等伟大、英明和正确！
    广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众无限欢欣鼓舞地说，毛主席的英明论断，给我们全国广大无产阶级革命派，指明了斗争的大方向，鼓舞着我们把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来，把混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的一批反革命修正主义分子揪了出来，并把他们那套修正主义货色拿出来示众，把他们斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，对他们进行夺权斗争，取得了极其伟大的胜利。但是，资产阶级不会自动退出历史舞台。现在我们揪出了一批反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台，今后还可能有另一批资产阶级代表人物登台表演。我们丝毫不能放松警惕。无产阶级革命派要永远把无产阶级专政这六个金光闪闪的大字，刻在心上，印在脑子里。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在热烈欢呼我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利的时候，表示要牢记毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”他们表示一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，在大批判的斗争中积极促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。他们说，我们的胜利只是万里长征的第一步，以后的路程还很长，任务更艰巨。我们一定要紧跟毛主席，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并且把大批判运动同本地区、本单位的斗批改结合起来，胜利地完成斗批改任务。我们还要更好地“抓革命，促生产”，使社会主义建设的各项事业进一步繁荣起来。
