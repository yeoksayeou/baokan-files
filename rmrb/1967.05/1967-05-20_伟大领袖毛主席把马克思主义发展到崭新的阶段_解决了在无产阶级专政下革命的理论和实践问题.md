Chairman Mao, the great leader, has developed Marxism to a new stage, solving the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 19th, during the process of studying and discussing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's (CPC) Circular, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary rebels, and revolutionary cadres in various places have emphasized that our great leader Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of problems in contemporary proletarian revolution. He has solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, setting up a new milestone in the history of Marxism. This has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat unanimously expressed their determination to further arm themselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought, never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, and persevering in carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, ensuring that our proletarian state remains red forever.

	In recent days, the broad revolutionary masses in Beijing, Shanghai, Taiyuan, Harbin, Jinan, Guiyang, and other regions have held celebration meetings, symposiums, and report meetings, launching a mass movement to study the Circular. They have combined the new situation of the current struggle with the experience of the past year's Cultural Revolution, repeatedly studying the CPC Central Committee's Circular and the important editorials from *Red Flag* and *People's Daily*: "A Great Historical Document." They pointed out that having such an enlightened and great leader as Chairman Mao is the greatest happiness for the people of our country and the people of the whole world. The Circular, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is a priceless treasure for the revolutionary people. The birth of this great historical document is a matter of paramount importance concerning the fate of our country and the world revolution. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, follow Chairman Mao's words, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. We must grasp this invincible ideological weapon, the Circular, and bravely advance against the storms of class struggle. We must ensure that the imperialists and revisionists' dream of restoring capitalism in China never comes true.

	The warriors of the Lu Xun Brigade of the Revolutionary Rebel Command of the Shanghai Sports Field said excitedly after studying the Circular: "The development of Marxism-Leninism to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought is another great milestone in the history of Marxism. This is our great leader Chairman Mao's greatest contribution to the revolutionary people of the world." Wang Jinguo, the chairman of the Datong Revolutionary Committee, said: "The great historical document, the Circular, is permeated with Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts. It summarizes the experience of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country and also the experience of the international communist movement. The great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven how great, wise, and correct our great leader Chairman Mao's scientific conclusions are." The old revolutionary workers of the Harbin Precision Tool Factory unanimously expressed at a symposium that the Circular and the article "A Great Historical Document" speak the hearts of the workers. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has solved a series of problems in contemporary proletarian revolution, solving the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, developing Marxism to a new stage. After studying the Circular, our direction is clearer, and our eyes are brighter. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	In an article, Lu Wentai of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee wrote: "The Circular, personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, clearly points out that after the proletariat seizes power, it must insist on the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure including various cultural fields, and the continued elimination of bourgeois representatives who sneak into the Communist Party and wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, etc. This is Chairman Mao's major development of Marxism-Leninism and an extremely great contribution to the international communist movement and world revolution." Wang Daoming, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from the Shenyang Military Region, wrote in his article: "Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, solving the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and pointing the way for the proletariat of the whole world to consolidate power after seizing it and ensure the transition from socialism to communism." Gu Atiao, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: "We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must fight to the end, overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party!"

	Over the past few years, the heroic crew of the Red Flag 155 (People's South China Sea 155) have excellently completed the task of transporting aid to Vietnam and fighting against America in the open sea of the Gulf of Tonkin, earning collective merit. While sailing on the vast sea, they continuously listened to the broadcast of the great historical document—the Circular of the CPC Central Committee—eight times. Over the past two days, they have eagerly seized the time to study the Circular of the CPC Central Committee and "A Great Historical Document." The crew members excitedly said: "While sailing on the vast sea, we cannot do without the compass and the map; while conducting proletarian revolution in contemporary times, we cannot do without the great Mao Zedong Thought." They said, "A year ago, the Circular, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, foiled the attempt of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism in our country, proposing the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and sounding the trumpet for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide. We must firmly remember the enlightened teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and turn our country into a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought."

	To better guide and organize the broad revolutionary masses to seriously and deeply study the Circular, this great historical document, the revolutionary committees of Beijing, Shandong, and other places have recently issued notices or decisions. These notices or decisions unanimously point out that this great historical document, personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, is a brilliant document that has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism to the highest level. This document proposes the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, solving the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This document is the guiding light for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the guiding light for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the guiding light for ensuring the transition from socialism to communism. The notices or decisions call on all revolutionary comrades to take immediate action, seriously study and discuss the Circular and the editorial article from *Red Flag* and *People's Daily*: "A Great Historical Document." Through studying this document, combine the new situation of the current struggle, combine the experience of the past year's struggle, further arm oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, further understand and grasp Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.
