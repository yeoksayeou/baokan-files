Pakistani Defense Minister Aftab Rahman Khan, a Rear Admiral, held a banquet in honor of his visit to China this evening.

	Invited to attend the banquet were Vice Premier Chen Yi, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xiao Hua, Deputy Ministers of Defense Xiao Jinguang and Wang Shusheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Han Nianlong, and responsible officials from various departments and branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

	At the banquet, Aftab Rahman Khan and Ye Jianying both spoke. Aftab Rahman Khan said, "Since we arrived in China, we have seen the great achievements made under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. We have seen that your people are united and determined to struggle for the high development and prosperity of your country. The Pakistani government and people wish the Chinese government and people even greater achievements."

	In discussing the warm reception he received from relevant Chinese sides, he said, "We consider this to be a symbol of the sincere friendship between the Chinese government and people towards Pakistan." He pointed out that the friendship and cooperation between the peoples of Pakistan and China are in the fundamental interests of the two peoples. This friendship and cooperation are positive and have important significance for the peace and prosperity of this region. He fully believes that the friendship between the peoples of Pakistan and China will continue to develop.

	Aftab Rahman Khan expressed gratitude for the support given by the Chinese government and people to the struggle of the Kashmiri people for the right to self-determination. He said, "China poses no threat to anyone, but hopes to live in peace and friendship with its neighboring countries." He proposed a toast, "To the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!"

	Ye Jianying, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan. He pointed out that in the struggle against foreign aggression, in defending the independence and sovereignty of their respective countries, and in promoting Asian-African solidarity against imperialism, the friendship between the peoples of China and Pakistan will certainly be further developed.

	Ye Jianying said, "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, grasped by hundreds of millions of people, has become a tremendous material force, bringing about a comprehensive new leap in our country's industrial and agricultural production, science and technology, culture and arts, and national defense."

	He pointed out, "The nature of imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries cannot be changed. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces.' However, their slander and lies do not harm a single hair of the Chinese people. Their deliberate acts of anti-China violence will not save them from their ultimate fate of death."

	Ye Jianying said, "The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will more powerfully oppose the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism, oppose the treacherous crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the revolutionary cause of the world's people, oppose the small group of reactionaries in various countries supported by imperialism and revisionism, and will more powerfully support the heroic Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, support the Pakistani people's struggle against the aggression and threats of the Indian reactionaries, who are the lackeys of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, support the struggle of the Kashmiri people for the right to self-determination, support the struggle of the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries against the aggression of American imperialism and its tool Israel, and support the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for the maintenance of national independence. We firmly believe that the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries will definitely achieve victory."

	Pakistani Foreign Secretary Yusuf attended the banquet. Pakistani Ambassador to China Sultan M. Khan and the military attaché of the embassy attended the banquet as hosts.

	This afternoon, the Pakistani guests, accompanied by Vice Minister of Defense Wang Shusheng and others, visited and toured the Sand River Chinese-Vietnamese Friendship People's Commune, where they were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of the commune.

    他在谈到中国有关方面的盛情接待时说，我们认为，这是中国政府和人民对巴基斯坦诚挚友谊的象征。他指出，巴中两国人民的友谊，是符合两国人民根本利益的。这种友谊和合作是积极的，对这个地区的和平和繁荣是有重要意义的。他完全相信，巴中两国人民的友谊将会继续发展。
    阿夫扎尔·拉赫曼·汗对中国政府和人民给予克什米尔人民争取自决权利的斗争的支持，表示感谢。他说，中国对任何人不构成威胁，而希望和她的邻国和平友好相处。他提议，为毛泽东主席健康，祝毛主席万寿无疆，干杯！
    叶剑英在讲话中热情颂扬中巴两国人民之间的友谊。他指出，在反对外来侵略、保卫各自国家的独立和主权、促进亚非团结反帝的斗争中，中巴两国人民的友谊，必将得到进一步的发展。
    叶剑英说，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，被亿万群众所掌握，变成了巨大的物质力量，给我国的工农业生产、科学技术、文化艺术和国防事业的发展带来了全面的新的跃进。经过文化大革命，我们的国家更加巩固、更加强大了。
