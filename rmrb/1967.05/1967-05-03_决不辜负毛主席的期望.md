	“Every time a festival comes, we miss our relatives even more.” We proletarian revolutionaries, on the annual May Day International Labor Day, miss our relative, Chairman Mao, even more. It was on this very night that I and all the members of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee saw our most beloved relative, our greatest leader, Chairman Mao. He received us on Tiananmen Gate.

	What a happy and unforgettable night this May Day was for me! At 9:40, amidst applause and cheers, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, walked towards us. Chairman Mao is so healthy! He is radiant and strides with vigor! This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China, and the greatest happiness for all the people of the world. I couldn’t help but wish in my heart that Chairman Mao lives forever, forever! Chairman Mao shook hands with each comrade he met and inquired about them. When he came to me, he held my hand and kindly asked, “So you are Tan Houlan?” At that moment, I had a thousand words to say, but I was so excited that I couldn’t utter a single word. I just smiled happily at Chairman Mao. From our great leader’s firm handshake, benevolent smile, and kind inquiries, I deeply felt his boundless concern and trust for us young revolutionaries, and also his boundless expectations for us.

	We will never disappoint the concern, trust, and expectations of our greatest leader!

	May Day is a day for the laboring people of the world to unite and fight. We proletarian revolutionaries must always remember our mission to unite and fight. Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us: we must unite with all those who can be united. He also emphasized that we must implement what Marx said, that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. Therefore, in our criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and in our struggle, criticism, and transformation within our units, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, “unite the majority, strike at the handful,” implement revolutionary great unity, and implement revolutionary “three-in-one” combinations.

	Whether or not we can implement revolutionary great unity is the key to carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Only by implementing revolutionary great unity can we truly isolate and overthrow the handful, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Revolutionary great unity is not only urgently necessary but also has realistic possibilities. Because we believe that the majority of cadres and masses are good, love Chairman Mao, and can stand on the side of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Through the practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past eleven months, many comrades who have made mistakes have already returned to the side of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. As long as we insist on the policy of uniting the majority, we will definitely unite all those who can be united and won over to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line.

	We young revolutionaries must firmly remember the great truth that only by liberating all humanity can the proletariat ultimately liberate itself. We must firmly grasp the major direction of struggle of “uniting the majority, striking at the handful,” and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is how we will not disappoint Chairman Mao’s concern, trust, and expectations for us!

### 决不辜负毛主席的期望

    决不辜负毛主席的期望
    北京市革命委员会常委
    北京师范大学井冈山公社负责人     谭厚兰
    “每逢佳节倍思亲”，我们无产阶级革命派在一年一度的“五一”国际劳动节里，更加思念我们的亲人毛主席。就在这天晚上，我和北京市革命委员会的全体委员们，见到了我们最最想念的亲人、最最伟大的领袖毛主席，他老人家在天安门城楼上接见了我们。
    今年的“五一”之夜，对于我是多么幸福多么难忘的一夜啊！九点四十分钟的时候，在一片掌声和一片欢呼声中，毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志向我们走来了。毛主席是多么健康啊！他容光焕发，步伐有力！这是全中国人民最大的幸福，这是全世界人民最大的幸福。我不禁在内心里祝愿毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！毛主席同每一个被接见的同志一边握手，一边询问。他老人家走到我的面前，握着我的手，并且亲切地问：“你就是谭厚兰呀？”这时候我有千言万语，却激动得一个字也说不上来，只是对着毛主席幸福地笑。从我们伟大领袖有力的握手、慈祥的微笑和亲切的询问中，我深深感到他老人家对我们革命小将无比的关怀，无比的信任，同时也对我们寄予无限的期望。
    我们决不辜负我们最最伟大的领袖对我们的关怀、信任和期望！
    “五一”节，这是全世界劳动人民团结战斗的节日，我们无产阶级革命派永远要记住自己团结战斗的任务。无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，毛主席又一再教导我们：要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。他还强调，必须实行马克思所说的，只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。因此，我们在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大批判中，在本单位的斗批改中，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“团结大多数，打击一小撮”，实行革命的大联合，实行革命的“三结合。”
    能否实行革命的大联合，是关系到能否把文化大革命进行到底的关键。只有实行革命的大联合，才能真正孤立和打倒一小撮，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    革命的大联合不仅有迫切的必要性，而且有现实的可能性。因为我们相信，干部和群众的大多数是好的，是热爱毛主席的，是能够站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边的。经过十一个月来文化大革命实践的教育，已经有很多犯错误的同志回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，只要我们坚持团结大多数的方针，一定会把一切可以争取团结的人争取团结到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    我们革命小将，要牢牢记住只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己这一伟大真理。要紧紧掌握“团结大多数、打击一小撮”这一斗争的大方向，把文化大革命进行到底。这才不会辜负毛主席对我们的关怀、信任和期望啊！
