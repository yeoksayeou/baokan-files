For many years, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, including Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, supported by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, have madly opposed Chairman Mao's instructions. They actively promoted feudal art to prepare public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. Their heinous crimes against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought must be thoroughly settled.

Opening the Green Light for Poisonous Weeds

In 1949, in many newly liberated cities, reactionary films, plays, and folk arts performed in collaboration with the toppled Chiang Kai-shek regime launched a frenzied counterattack against the people. Faced with this reality, should we follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "learn to wage political, economic, and cultural struggles against imperialists, the Kuomintang, and the bourgeoisie in the cities" and fight them resolutely? Or should we adopt a policy of compromise and surrender? This was a major issue. In this sharp struggle, the top capitalist-roader within the Party stood on the reactionary position of the landlords and bourgeoisie, openly opposing Chairman Mao's instructions. In April 1949, he told the responsible officials of the Tianjin cultural circle: "Tianjin has banned some old plays, causing the performers to have no food to eat. People are not satisfied, and there are problems that we need to solve. This is a stupid thing to do." He also said: "What's wrong with promoting feudalism? Monks and nuns are not banned, so why ban plays?" He ordered: "For everything that needs to be reviewed, the standards must be relaxed." "We don't need to review books and scripts anymore!" In this way, this top capitalist-roader within the Party completely abolished the Party's criticism and struggle against feudal art, opening the door wide for the spread of poisonous weeds.

In 1956, under Chairman Mao's leadership, the Chinese people basically achieved agricultural cooperation, and private industrial and commercial enterprises were transformed into joint state-private enterprises. At this critical moment, the top capitalist-roader within the Party jumped out again to oppose Chairman Mao's instruction to "remove the feudal dross and absorb the democratic essence" of cultural heritage. He blathered on about how "we must carefully inherit the beneficial cultural heritage of the old era for the people." This essentially meant fully accepting feudal culture. He also told the responsible officials of the old Cultural Bureau: "Beijing opera is a very high art; it is not acceptable to change it." "Don't make major changes. Change only if it is harmful, don't change if it is not harmful." Thus, the old Propaganda Department and the old Cultural Bureau, a small clique of revisionists, immediately drafted a plan to fully inherit old opera. In less than half a year, they "dug up" more than fifty thousand old opera scripts. In 1957, they held the Second National Opera Script Work Conference under the pretext of "organizing heritage," openly lifting the ban on twenty-six reactionary scripts. Among them, the highly poisonous play "Four Generals Visit Their Mother," which praises traitors, was performed unchanged, sparking strong opposition from the masses. However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party said: "It's okay to sing 'Four Generals Visit Their Mother'! We've sung it for so many years, and it hasn't sung out a new China!" The top capitalist-roader within the Party's nonsense fully exposed his ugly face of defending reactionary art.

Under the encouragement and support of this top capitalist-roader within the Party, demons and monsters of all kinds rushed onto the stage of drama and folk arts. According to statistics for just one month in June 1957, Beijing, Shanghai, and ten other major cities performed reactionary plays such as "Killing the Son to Report" and "Big Coffin Splitting," which promote feudal superstitions, a total of 994 times; extremely reactionary stage plays like "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" and "Red-Haired Corpse," a total of 1,660 times; traitor plays like "Four Generals Visit Their Mother" and obscene plays like "The Widow Ma Opens a Shop," a total of 1,099 times. At the same time, the folk arts also released more than a hundred reactionary long stories like "Hai Rui's Red Robe," "Ji Gong's Biography," and "Three Knights' Sword," not to mention thousands of short stories. These reactionary things were tightly coordinated with the rightists' frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism at that time. For a while, evil winds blew and waves rolled, making one's hair stand on end. From these series of events, it is clear that the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the small clique of revisionists he supported, with their so-called "careful inheritance" and "beneficial and harmless," are all black words to incite the spread of poisonous weeds; their so-called "digging up traditions" and "opening scripts" are completely black orders to attack the Party.

Promoting "Using the Past to Satirize the Present," Using "Historical Plays" to Launch Anti-Party Activities

In 1960, under the support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, another major capitalist-roader within the Party issued a black order: "Old plays should do less modern ones and more historical plays." The master gave the order, and Zhou Yang and Xia Yan immediately followed, promoting that old opera should take the path of "using the past to satirize the present." On November 19, 1960, Zhou Yang, with the support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, instructed the "ancestor" of the opera circle, Tan Han, to hold a black meeting, plotting to use "historical plays" to attack the Party. Tan Han ranted: "Our opera is mainly historical plays," and incited some reactionary "historians" and "dramatists" to boldly create poisonous weeds. That afternoon, Zhou Yang personally took the stage, holding a so-called "historical play symposium." Zhou Yang proposed the fallacies of "Beijing opera, Kunqu, and even all writing historical themes are allowed." At this black meeting under the name of "historical play symposium," Zhou Yang also said: "The history of the Chinese feudal era produced many heroes of the feudal era," what "Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao holding the emperor to command the princes is not simple," what "Zeng Guofan is the culmination of the feudal society, a remarkable figure." Under his incitement, many reactionaries like Wu Han, Hou Wailu, and Jian Bozan proposed things like "Confucius can be written" and "Sima Qian suffered persecution and can also be written," and even proposed the argument that "reversal plays have great educational value and also have the effect of rectification." It is clear that these people's purpose in doing "historical plays" is to "use the past to satirize the present," madly attacking our Party, attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, restoring the rightist opportunists who have been removed from office, restoring the reputation of the rightists, and attempting to overthrow our socialist system through art to create public opinion. Sure enough, not long after this meeting, the old hand at anti-communism, the counter-revolutionary Wu Han, rushed out the highly poisonous play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to complain about the rightist opportunists being removed from office. Tan Han's highly poisonous play "Xie Yaohuan" and Meng Chao's ghost play "Li Huimian" also came out one after another.

From 1960 to 1962, it was a period of temporary difficulties for our country. A small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural circle, under the support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, in coordination with the anti-China clamor of international imperialism, modern revisionism, and various reactionary forces, in response to the demons and monsters in society, used old art to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, committing heinous crimes. However, in March 1963, when the top capitalist-roader within the Party listened to the old Cultural Bureau's report on the "situation," he twisted black and white, hinting at an attack on our great leader Chairman Mao. This is intolerable!

Madly Opposing Chairman Mao's Instructions, Attempting to Sabotage the Beijing Opera Revolution

In December 1963, Chairman Mao said: "Various forms of art—drama, folk arts, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, many people, and socialist transformation in many fields has achieved very little. Many fields are still ruled by 'dead people.'" Chairman Mao's instructions shone brightly, illuminating the dark corner of the art world, causing the big and small capitalist-roaders on the art black line to panic. After they calmed down, they immediately launched a counterattack. More than twenty days after Chairman Mao's instructions were issued, the top capitalist-roader within the Party personally presided over a meeting and had his trusted subordinate Zhou Yang talk about the "achievements" of the art world at the meeting, and then he affirmed them. The top capitalist-roader within the Party also said: "Since liberation, there have been many good things, and in the past few years, the upper structure and economic base have been quite adaptable." This was a direct opposition to Chairman Mao's instructions. Chairman Mao said: "Many communists enthusiastically promote feudal and capitalist art but are not enthusiastic about promoting socialist art. Isn't this strange?" The top capitalist-roader within the Party said: "The art world likes these (feudal) things, and various levels of cadres also like to watch emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties!" With the support of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, Zhou Yang dared to directly attack Chairman Mao's instructions. He said: "Only a few people want to do bourgeois and feudal things, most people just have a problem of understanding." It is particularly noteworthy that when Zhou Yang mentioned "supporting ghost plays with more than two hundred articles, which represents a force," the top capitalist-roader within the Party joyfully said: "They feel that ghost plays are good and have level!" Still supporting the spread of ghost plays.

In June 1964, Chairman Mao made another instruction on the problems in the art world. The top capitalist-roader within the Party and his clique felt that the situation was not good, and after careful planning, they staged a fake rectification in the art world. At the same time, they attempted to sabotage the National Beijing Opera Modern Play Performance Conference under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing. At this performance, they first used methods such as "reducing the scope of the performance" and delaying the performance date to try to make the performance fail; later, when these plots failed and the Beijing Opera Modern Play Performance was successfully opened, they suddenly intervened, appointing Lu Dingyi to give the opening speech, arranging Zhou Yang to give the summary, and the head of the old Beijing Municipal Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to give a "report," attempting to further sabotage this performance. Even after the performance was successfully concluded, the top capitalist-roader within the Party still madly shouted: "Historical plays must be done," "Some patriotic ones, some that increase people's wisdom (referring to old plays), can still be performed!" While the old Cultural Bureau immediately proposed a plan and submitted a report, requesting to "open traditional plays" immediately.

"With a golden monkey raising a thousand-catty cudgel, the jade sky is cleansed of ten thousand dusts." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these revisionists were one by one pulled out. We must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose the top capitalist-roader within the Party, the biggest backer of the art black line, and the greatest supporter of feudal art, and let revolutionary new drama and new folk arts grow vigorously under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought!

    扶植封建文艺的罪魁
    文化部机关延安红旗总团
    十几年来，周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，疯狂地对抗毛主席的指示，积极扶植封建文艺，为他们复辟资本主义准备舆论。对他们这种反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，必须进行彻底的总清算。
    为毒草出笼大开绿灯
    一九四九年，在刚刚解放的许多大城市里，反动的影片、戏剧、曲艺等配合着被推翻了的蒋家王朝向人民进行疯狂的反扑。面对这个现实，我们是按照毛主席的“必须学会在城市中向帝国主义者、国民党、资产阶级作政治斗争、经济斗争和文化斗争”的指示，对它们展开坚决的斗争，还是实行妥协投降的方针？这是个大是大非的问题。在这场尖锐的斗争中，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，站在地主、资产阶级的反动立场上，公然对抗毛主席的指示。一九四九年四月，他对天津文艺界负责人说：“天津禁了些旧戏，使艺人没有饭吃了，人家不满意，有问题还要我们解决，这是干了一桩蠢事。”又说：“宣扬封建怕什么？和尚尼姑都不禁止，还禁戏？”他指令：“凡是要审查的东西，尺度必须放宽。”“出书、出剧本，我们不要审查了！”就是这样，这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派完全取消了党对封建文艺的批判和斗争，为毒草泛滥大开方便之门。
    一九五六年，我国人民在毛主席领导下，基本上实现了农业合作化，私营工商业也改变为公私合营企业。正当这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派又跳出来反对毛主席对文化遗产“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华”的指示。他胡说什么：“我们对于旧时代有益于人民的文化遗产，必须谨慎地加以继承。”这实质上就是全盘接受封建文化。他还对旧文化部负责人说：“京剧是很高的艺术，改掉了是不行的。”“不要大改。有害则改，无害不改。”于是，旧中宣部和旧文化部一小撮修正主义分子以“挖掘传统”为名，立即拟定了一个全盘继承旧戏曲的计划。在不到半年的时间内，就“挖掘”出了五万多出旧戏曲剧目。一九五七年，他们又以“整理遗产”为名，召开了第二次全国戏曲剧目工作会议，公然解除二十六个反动剧目的禁演令。其中歌颂汉奸的大毒草《四郎探母》，原封不动地被搬上舞台，引起了广大群众激烈反对。但是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派竟然说：“《四郎探母》，唱唱也不要紧嘛！唱了这么多年，不是唱出一个新中国了吗！”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的这一派胡言，完全暴露了他为反动文艺进行辩护的丑恶嘴脸。
    就在这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的纵容和扶持下，戏剧、曲艺舞台上，牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来。仅据一九五七年六月份一个月的统计，北京、上海等十大城市上演的反动戏有：宣扬封建迷信的《杀子报》、《大劈棺》等，共演了九九四场；极端反动的连台本戏《火烧红莲寺》、《红毛僵尸》等，共演了一六六○场；汉奸戏如《四郎探母》、色情戏如《马寡妇开店》等，共演了一○九九场。同时，曲艺界也放出了《海瑞大红袍》、《济公传》、《三侠剑》等反动的长篇评书不下百部，至于短段说唱则不下千种。这些反动东西与当时右派分子向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻是紧相配合的。一时阴风阵阵、恶浪滚滚，真是令人触目惊心。从这一系列情况看来，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其支持下的一小撮修正主义分子的什么“谨慎地继承”，什么“有益无害”，统统都是鼓动毒草出笼的黑话；什么“挖掘传统”，什么“开放剧目”，完全是向党发动进攻的黑号令。
    鼓吹“以古讽今”，利用“历史剧”大搞反党活动
    一九六○年，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持下，党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派发出黑号令：“旧戏要少搞现代的，多搞点历史剧。”主子发令，周扬、夏衍一伙立即跟着鼓吹旧戏曲要走“以古讽今”的路子。一九六○年十一月十九日，周扬在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，指使戏曲界“祖师爷”田汉召开黑会，阴谋利用“历史剧”向党进攻。田汉胡说：“我们的戏曲，主要就是历史剧”，并煽动一些反动的“史学家”、“戏剧家”们大胆炮制毒草。当天下午，周扬又亲自出马，召开所谓“历史剧座谈会”。周扬提出封建戏曲、现代戏“两条腿走路”，和按剧种分工的谬论，说什么“京剧、昆曲甚至全部都写历史题材，我看也是允许的。”在这个以“历史剧座谈”为名的黑会上，周扬还说：“中国封建时代的历史，产生了许多封建时代的英雄人物”，什么“董卓、曹操挟天子以令诸侯是不简单的”，什么“曾国藩是封建社会集大成的人物，是了不起的人物”。在他的鼓动下，许多反动家伙如吴晗、侯外庐、翦伯赞之流便纷纷提出什么“孔夫子可写”啦，什么“司马迁受过摧残也可写”啦，并且还提出“翻案戏有很大教育作用，兼有平反作用”的论调。可见，这帮家伙搞“历史剧”的目的，是要“以古讽今”，疯狂地攻击我们的党，攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，替罢了官的右倾机会主义分子翻案，为右派分子“恢复名誉”，并且妄图通过文艺制造舆论，搞垮我们的社会主义制度。果然，在这次会后不久，反共老手、反革命分子吴晗为右倾机会主义分子罢官“鸣不平”的大毒草《海瑞罢官》，就急冲冲破门而出了。田汉的大毒草《谢瑶环》、孟超的鬼戏《李慧娘》也相继出笼了。
    一九六○年至一九六二年，正是我国遭受暂时困难时期，文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，配合着国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华叫嚣，同社会上的牛鬼蛇神相呼应，利用旧文艺向党发动猖狂进攻，犯下了滔天罪行。可是，一九六三年三月，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在听取旧文化部汇报“情况”时，却颠倒黑白，含沙射影地攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    疯狂地反对毛主席的批示，妄图破坏京剧革命
    一九六三年十二月，毛主席说：“各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是‘死人’统治着。”毛主席的批示光芒万丈，射向文艺界这块阴暗得发霉的角落，因此文艺黑线上大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派惊慌万状。他们惊魂稍定，就立即进行反扑。在毛主席的批示下达二十多天之后，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派便亲自主持了一次会议，并且让他的得力干将周扬在会上大谈文艺界的“成绩”，然后由他加以“肯定”。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派也说：“解放以来，有很多好东西嘛，这几年在上层建筑与经济基础问题上，是相当适应的。”这完全是对抗毛主席的批示的。毛主席说：“许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派则说：“文艺界喜欢这些（封建的）东西，各级干部也喜欢看帝王将相才子佳人嘛！”有党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持，周扬便胆大包天地直接攻击毛主席的批示。他说：“只是少数人要搞资产阶级、封建主义的东西，大多数人只是个认识问题。”特别值得注意的是：当周扬提到“支持鬼戏的文章有二百多篇，这代表了一种势力”时，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派竟兴高采烈地说：“他们感到鬼戏好，有水平！”仍然为鬼戏的出笼撑腰。
    一九六四年六月，毛主席对文艺界问题又一次作了批示。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙感到大势不妙，经过精心策划之后，搞了一场舍车保帅的文艺界假整风。同时，他们又妄图破坏在江青同志指导下的全国京剧现代戏会演大会。在这次会演中，他们先用“缩小会演范围”、推迟会演日期等手段，妄图使会演夭折；后来，当这些阴谋破产，京剧现代戏会演胜利开幕的时候，他们又突然插手进去，指定陆定一致开幕词，安排周扬作总结，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团头子做“报告”，妄图进一步破坏这次会演。甚至在会演胜利结束以后，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派还疯狂地叫嚷：“历史剧就是要搞”，“有些爱国主义的，有些增加人的智慧的（指旧戏），还是可以演！”而旧文化部当即提方案、打报告，要求立即“开放传统戏”。
    “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，这些修正主义分子一个个被揪出来了。我们必须继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派这条文艺黑线的总后台、封建文艺的最大支持者彻底批倒批臭，让革命的新戏剧、新曲艺在毛泽东思想的阳光雨露下茁壮地成长吧！
