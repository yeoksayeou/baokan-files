The world-shaking Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution has struck fear into the hearts of the Soviet revisionists. They fear the Chinese people, fear the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution, and fear the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. They hate to the core those who stand for world revolution, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, and actively support the struggles of oppressed peoples and nations for liberation. Therefore, they are like a desperate gambler, cursing and attacking China day and night; they are like a furious hooligan, trying to rally a bunch of riffraff to attack China.

First, in Asia, around China, the Soviet revisionists are eagerly helping the U.S. imperialists to form an anti-China encirclement, attempting to resist the impact of the Chinese revolution on the world and preparing to attack socialist China.

The present-day Soviet revisionist leadership is preparing to establish diplomatic relations with the puppet regime of "Malaysia," a lackey of imperialism, and shamelessly published articles in *Pravda* praising the "realistic evaluation" of the international situation by the "Malaysia" puppet regime.

What a "realism"!

We remember how Khrushchev once shamelessly praised Kennedy and Johnson's "realism," saying that Kennedy "realistically assessed the situation" and that Johnson's position was a "manifestation of realism," and so on. Now, Brezhnev and Kosygin are no less than their predecessor Khrushchev, praising the extremely reactionary "Malaysia" puppet regime. It is clear that in the vocabulary of the Soviet revisionists, "realism" has become a label for imperialism and reactionaries.

The Soviet revisionists probably also start from this "realism," sending signals to the darkest and most reactionary forces in the world, tightening their collusion, and getting along very well. Why? Their goal is only one: to join hands with U.S. imperialism to cobble together a new "Holy Alliance" to oppose China, the people, and revolution.

The Soviet revisionists' despicable and evil purpose is not hidden even from the reactionaries. The puppet Prime Minister of "Malaysia," Rahman, openly and arrogantly said that its approach to the Soviet revisionists "will have the effect of containing China."

The Soviet revisionist clique is tightening its collusion with the Japanese reactionary government, shamelessly praising the Sato government as a "stabilizing force in Asia." To pull the Japanese reactionaries into opposing China, they proposed to the Japanese government a plan to welcome investment in the development of Siberia, the scope and content of which surprised even the Japanese zaibatsu. They also signed a so-called "basic agreement on technological exchange" with the Japanese monopoly capital "Mitsubishi Group," providing this Japanese financial group, whose hands are stained with the blood of Asian peoples, with information on atomic energy technology. The Soviet revisionists even do not hesitate to sell out their sovereignty, for the first time opening Siberian airspace to foreign airlines and concluding an aviation agreement with Japan. In addition, they made major concessions and signed a series of agreements on fisheries, consular affairs, and other matters with the Japanese reactionary authorities.

The Soviet revisionists have strengthened their collusion with the right-wing military clique in Indonesia. The Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique in Indonesia is a lackey of U.S. imperialism with hands stained with the blood of the Indonesian revolutionary people, and it has established a barefaced fascist dictatorship in Indonesia. The Soviet revisionist leadership openly provides full political, economic, and military support to such an extremely reactionary fascist military regime. In January of this year, the Indonesian reactionaries announced that they had reached an agreement with the Soviet revisionists to continue providing weapons and spare parts to Indonesia. The Soviet revisionist leadership also agreed to allow the right-wing military regime in Indonesia to defer the repayment of debts and, following the footsteps of U.S. imperialism, is preparing to invest, loan, and expand trade in Indonesia to help the Indonesian reactionaries, who are in trouble both internally and externally, to oppose China and communism, and to massacre the people.

The Soviet revisionists follow the U.S. imperialists in supporting the Indian reactionaries, providing the Indian government with a large amount of economic and military aid, from heavy tanks, missiles, and Mig-21 fighter jets to submarines, wheat, oil, and tractors, everything is included. Just think about how the Indian reactionaries are crazily opposing China, and you will understand the meaning of these aids.

The Soviet revisionists are also doing a lot in the Philippines, promoting what they call "exploratory dialogue" between Manila and Moscow, exchanging trade and cultural delegations, and even formally proposing to sign trade and economic agreements with the Philippine government. They also come and go with the Thai puppet regime and even flirt with the South Korean puppet regime.

In Africa and Latin America, the Soviet revisionist clique is also specialized in colluding with reactionary forces. For example, they praise the U.S. imperialists' lackey Mobutu in the Congo (Kinshasa) and are even prepared to negotiate the restoration of diplomatic relations with this executioner of Lumumba. They have also recently become close with the Colombian military dictatorship, which brutally suppresses the armed struggle of the people, and are discussing providing it with scientific, technological, and financial aid.

In Europe, in addition to getting along well with imperialist countries, the Soviet revisionists have also signed a maritime agreement with the infamous Franco regime in Spain. They sent the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to visit the Vatican and pay homage to the Pope.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed the world revolution and is willing to conspire with the political dregs, national scum, and darkest forces of various countries. Is this not clear?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with imperialism and reactionaries to cobble together a counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" is not surprising; it just shows that they are birds of a feather, flocking together.

However, history is advancing, and the surging waves of the world people's revolution are roaring. Today's Brezhnev and his ilk, who are meddling in the "Holy Alliance," will inevitably fail faster and more miserably than the "Holy Alliance" of Tsar Alexander I. This bunch of traitors will all be thrown into the garbage dump of history by the great Soviet people who have the glorious tradition of struggle of the Great October Revolution.

    震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命使苏修吓破了胆。他们害怕中国人民，害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命，害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想。他们对于坚持世界革命、坚决反对美帝国主义、积极支持被压迫人民和被压迫民族解放斗争的中国恨之入骨。因此，他们象一个绝望了的赌棍，整天喋喋不休地破口大骂，恶毒攻击中国；他们又象一个气急败坏的流氓，妄图纠集一群败类来围攻中国。
    首先是在亚洲，在中国的周围，苏修起劲地帮助美帝，正在拉起一个反华包围圈，妄图抵制中国革命对世界的影响，并且准备进攻社会主义中国。
    苏联现代修正主义领导集团最近准备同帝国主义的走狗“马来西亚”傀儡集团建立外交关系，而且恬不知耻地在《真理报》上接连发表通讯文章，肉麻地吹捧“马来西亚”傀儡集团“现实主义地评价了国际舞台上形成的局势。”
    好一个“现实主义”！
    我们记得，赫鲁晓夫当年曾无耻地吹捧肯尼迪和约翰逊的“现实主义”，说什么肯尼迪“现实地估计局势”呀，约翰逊的立场“是现实感的表现”呀，等等。如今，勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流比他们的前辈赫鲁晓夫毫无逊色，吹捧起反动透顶的“马来西亚”傀儡集团来了。不难看出，原来在苏修的词汇里，“现实主义”成了帝国主义和反动派的标志。
    苏修自己大概也是从这种“现实主义”出发吧，他们同世界上的最黑暗、最反动的势力互送秋波，加紧勾结，打得火热。为什么？他们的目的只有一个：同美帝合伙拼凑新的“神圣同盟”，来反华、反人民、反革命。
    苏修这种卑鄙的罪恶目的，连反动派也不隐讳。美英帝国主义炮制的新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”的傀儡总理拉赫曼就公开猖狂地说，它同苏修接近“将产生对中国的遏制的效果”。
    苏修集团加紧勾结日本反动政府，无耻地吹捧佐藤政府是什么“亚洲的稳定力量”。为了拉拢日本反动派反华，他们向日本政府提出了一个欢迎投资开发西伯利亚的计划，其范围之广泛、内容之庞大，连日本财阀都大为吃惊。他们还和日本垄断资本“三井财团”签订了所谓“关于技术交流的基本协定”，向这个双手沾满亚洲人民鲜血的日本财阀集团提供关于原子能技术的资料。苏修甚至不惜出卖主权，第一次向外国航空公司开放西伯利亚领空，与日本缔结了航空协定。此外，还以重大的让步与日本反动当局签订了渔业、领事等一系列协定。
    苏修加强了同印尼右派军人集团的勾结。印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团是双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血的美帝国主义的走狗，它在印尼建立了一个赤裸裸的法西斯专政。苏修领导集团对于这样一个反动透顶的法西斯军人政权，竟然公开给以政治、经济、军事的全面支持。今年一月，印尼反动派宣布已同苏修达成协议，由苏联继续向印尼提供武器备件。苏修领导集团还答应印尼右派军人政权可以延期偿还所欠债款，并紧跟美帝脚步，准备向印尼投资、贷款和扩大贸易，以便向内外交困的印尼反动派输血，帮助它反华、反共，屠杀人民。
    苏修追随美帝支持印度反动派，给予了印度政府大量的经济援助和军事援助，从重型坦克、导弹、米格—21型战斗机和潜水艇，到小麦、石油、拖拉机，样样俱全。想一下印度反动派是怎样疯狂反华，就会清楚看出这些援助的含义了。
    苏修对菲律宾，也在大搞什么马尼拉和莫斯科之间的“探讨性对话”，要互派贸易文化代表团，并且还正式提出要同菲律宾政府签订贸易和经济协议。他们同泰国傀儡集团也来来往往，甚至还同南朝鲜傀儡集团勾勾搭搭。
    在非洲和拉丁美洲，苏修集团也是专门同反动势力勾结的。例如，他们吹捧美帝在刚果（金）的走狗蒙博托，甚至准备同这个屠杀卢蒙巴的刽子手商谈恢复邦交。他们对于大力镇压人民武装斗争的哥伦比亚军事独裁政权，最近也亲热起来了，正在讨论给它科学、技术和财政援助。
    在欧洲，苏修除了同帝国主义国家打得火热以外，还同臭名远扬的西班牙佛朗哥政权签订了海运协定。他们派出堂堂的苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席去访问梵蒂冈，拜谒教皇。
    苏修领导集团叛卖世界革命，甘心与世界各国的政治渣滓、民族败类和最黑暗的势力同流合污，这不是十分清楚了吗？
    毛主席教导说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。苏修领导集团同帝国主义和反动派勾搭在一起，拼凑反革命的“神圣同盟”，并没有什么奇怪，正好说明了它们是物以类聚，人以群分。
    但是，历史在前进，世界人民革命的巨浪汹涌澎湃。今天勃列日涅夫之流插手的“神圣同盟”，比起当年沙皇亚历山大一世所搞的“神圣同盟”，必然是要失败得更快，更惨。苏修这一伙叛徒，必将被具有伟大十月革命光荣斗争传统的苏联人民通通都抛进历史的垃圾堆。
