*Spark* is a reactionary film that distorts history, reverses right and wrong, and praises the number one capitalist-roader in the party, erecting a monument to his deeds. The Anshun Strike, a shining moment in the history of the Chinese workers' movement, was a revolutionary movement personally organized and led by Chairman Mao. It was a great display of the strength of the Chinese proletariat.

However, for a long time, the history of the Anshun Strike has been distorted by a small clique of malicious individuals. The chief culprit in this historical revisionism is the number one capitalist-roader in the party. Using his authority, he often boasts, "When I was in Anshun," attributing the merits of opening up Anshun and leading the Anshun Strike to himself, using this as political capital to oppose Chairman Mao. A group of revisionists, following their master's instructions, worked tirelessly. They wrote articles, gave speeches, compiled books, collected materials, and used various propaganda tools to extol the number one capitalist-roader in the party. *Spark* is one of these artistic representations.

From the beginning, the film emphasizes the gloomy and terrifying social life and the ignorance and backwardness of the working class, painting a suffocating picture of "gloomy and sorrowful." However, when Lei Huanjue—the embodiment of the number one capitalist-roader in the party—appears, the dark clouds in the sky disperse, and the earth shines with new light. The film highlights the words "1921" in close-up, equating Lei Huanjue's arrival with the founding of the party, as if he were the party and the party were him. After arriving in Anshun, he starts everything from scratch, from "one person, two hands" enlightenment education to organizing the strike and achieving "victory," as if the entire Anshun was opened up by him and the Anshun Strike was initiated and organized by him. Through these illusions, the film attempts to make people believe that the number one capitalist-roader in the party is the "highest leader" of the Anshun workers' strike and an "authority" on the workers' movement.

However, false appearances cannot conceal the truth.

The workers' movement in Anshun was personally organized and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. As early as the winter of 1921, Chairman Mao came to Anshun to start work. He went deep into the workers' masses, awakened their class consciousness, propagated revolutionary ideas, and called on them to organize and fight decisively against the capitalist authorities. Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities and great teachings ignited the revolutionary fire in the hearts of the Anshun workers, laying the ideological, organizational, and mass foundations for the victory of the strike. On the eve of the strike, Chairman Mao personally went to Anshun, providing a profound analysis of the international and domestic situation at the time, pointing out that the conditions for the strike were ripe, and giving wise instructions and arrangements for the strike. The number one capitalist-roader in the party only arrived in Anshun on the eve of the strike. In Anshun, he did not implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line but promoted a right-opportunist capitulationist line; he did not expose the capitalists' exploitation of the workers but peddled the black goods of "exploitation is reasonable" and "capitalists feed the workers"; he did not propagate class struggle but advocated "labor-capital cooperation"; he did not call on the workers to rebel but told them to "be obedient" and "maintain" the mine's production; he did not educate the workers to liberate themselves but placed hope in the capitalists' "goodwill" and "wisdom"; he did not see the workers' movement as "very good" but slandered it as "arbitrary," "crowd disturbance," and "extortion." All of this fully shows that the number one capitalist-roader in the party is not a representative of the revolutionary interests of the working class but a defender of the exploitative system; he is not a leader of the workers' movement but a saboteur of the workers' movement.

Yet, the creators of *Spark*, under the guise of "artistic license," not only distorted history and erased his crimes but also fabricated lies, attributing Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities to him. During the production of the film, the revisionist clique led by Zhou Yang maliciously claimed that Chairman Mao's early thoughts were all in the number one capitalist-roader in the party. They fiercely opposed portraying Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities on screen and opposed the appearance of Chairman Mao's glorious name and great voice. This was not only to belittle Chairman Mao and establish the "authority" of the number one capitalist-roader in the party but also to propagate the extremely reactionary idea of a "Chinese revolution without Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought," as if without Chairman Mao, the number one capitalist-roader could also lead a "revolution" and achieve "victory."

This is a complete political deception! Chairman Mao is our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no New China, no great victory of the socialist revolution, and certainly no victory of the Anshun Strike. The path of revolution and victory without Chairman Mao, as advocated by *Spark*, is a pure revisionist path, a clear exposure of the number one capitalist-roader in the party's counter-revolutionary conspiracy to usurp the party and the state!

*Spark* also does not hesitate to defame and slander the great image of the working class, highlighting the personal role of the number one capitalist-roader in the party, portraying him as the "savior" of the working class.

Chairman Mao taught us, "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." However, the workers in the film *Spark* are all apathetic and helpless "masses." Some are soft and easily manipulated; some are cowardly and pitiful; some, under heavy oppression and exploitation, are powerless and can only die in silence, as if the working class, apart from enduring oppression and exploitation, has no other way but to die. However, when Lei Huanjue, the number one capitalist-roader in the party, arrives, these "ignorant mobs" suddenly feel enlightened and hopeful. In the film, Yi Laoye says, "For decades, every time there was trouble, it was the mine authorities who manipulated us. Finally, Old Lei came... we finally have a backbone." The film praises Lei Huanjue as having "knowledge," "achievements," and "courage," leading the workers to achieve strike "victory." Here, the workers do not realize the great power of the entire class but only Lei Huanjue's "wisdom"; they do not see the great leadership of the party and Chairman Mao but only Lei Huanjue as their "backbone." They do everything "as Old Lei says," "find Old Lei," treating him as a "benefactor" and "savior," constantly mentioning "our Lei director" and "our representative," but never mentioning Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, which is extremely malicious. During the negotiations, the workers are not there to strike against the capitalists but to act as bodyguards for Lei Huanjue; they are not there to show their strength but to follow Lei Huanjue, waving flags and shouting slogans, acting as his backdrop. What is even more unacceptable is that the film reverses right and wrong, portraying such a traitor as a "hero" fighting against the capitalists. In front of Chen, the foreman who came to monitor the workers' night school, he is so imposing and inviolable; at the critical moment when Zheng Hai died and the workers faced off against the capitalists, he "stepped forward," and a shout scared the chief supervisor Wang Liankui into putting down his raised gun; in the scene where he negotiates with the capitalists, despite the swords and guns, he remains "calm," engaging in a battle of wits with a group of armed enemies, displaying a heroic demeanor and a lone hero's courage!

Is this really the case? No! It is precisely this number one capitalist-roader in the party who was terrified by the revolutionary fire of the Anshun workers. In his view, the Anshun Strike was "taking a desperate gamble," a situation of "riding a tiger," forced to act. These eight words reveal the cowardly and hollow soul of this number one capitalist-roader! According to the revelations of old workers from Anshun, he was trembling with fear during his negotiations with the capitalists, and the workers protected him as he walked up to the negotiation hall. After the negotiations ended, he was still in shock, with lingering fear. This is not a "brave" hero but a cowardly fool! Linked to his advocacy of the philosophy of survival in *Self-Cultivation* and his servile attitude towards the capitalists, the slave face of this so-called "old revolutionary" is fully exposed.

The reactionary film *Spark*, which praises the number one capitalist-roader in the party and erects a monument to his deeds, appeared in 1962, which was not accidental.

1962 was a time when the class struggle between the two classes and the two roads in our country was extremely sharp and complex. Ghosts and monsters emerged, launching fierce attacks on the party and socialism, attempting to restore capitalism. It was at this time that the number one capitalist-roader in the party also joined the battle, fiercely attacking the party and Chairman Mao, attacking Mao Zedong Thought, and elevating himself. He said things like, "We must learn from Stalin's lessons, not emphasize personal cults anymore, not shout long live the living individual anymore," and arrogantly declared, "The old ones are no good, they must step down and make way." He not only personally appeared, re-releasing the anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought book *Self-Cultivation*, but also plotted behind the scenes, instructing his followers to beautify and praise him. *Spark* was produced under this political background. It is clear that it was prepared to create public opinion for the number one capitalist-roader in the party to usurp the party and the state.

However, history is so ruthless! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, shattered the illusions of the number one capitalist-roader in the party and a small clique of revisionists, dragging them out one by one, which was so satisfying! "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength," under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must thoroughly fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to disgrace the number one capitalist-roader in the party!

    彻底砸烂这块黑碑
    ——评影片《燎原》
    文红兵
    《燎原》是一部颠倒黑白，歪曲历史，为党内头号走资本主义道路当权派歌功颂德、树碑立传的反动影片。
    在中国工人运动史上永放光芒的安源罢工运动，是在毛主席亲自组织和领导下进行的一场革命运动，是中国工人阶级力量的一次伟大检阅。
    可是长期以来，关于安源罢工运动的历史却被一小撮别有用心的家伙颠倒了，这篡改历史的罪魁祸首就是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。他利用职权，经常吹嘘“我在安源时”如何如何，把开辟安源和领导安源罢工斗争的功绩一古脑儿算在他的“功劳簿上”，以此作为他和毛主席唱对台戏的政治资本。一小撮修正主义分子秉承其主子的意旨，大效犬马之劳。他们写文章，作报告，编书籍，收资料，利用各种宣传工具，大肆吹捧党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派。《燎原》就是表现于艺术形象的其中一个。
    影片一开始，着力渲染社会生活的阴森恐怖和工人阶级的愚昧落后，整个画面是一幅“阴凄凄，愁惨惨”的令人窒息的图画。可是，当雷焕觉——党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的化身——出现时，茫茫天空乌云尽扫，沉沉大地万物生辉。影片推出“一九二一年”几个特写大字，把雷焕觉的到来和党的成立相提并论，好象他就是党，党就是他。他到了安源之后，一切从头开始，从“一人两手”的启蒙教育到开展罢工斗争，并取得“胜利”，仿佛整个安源是他一手开辟的，安源罢工运动是他一手发动和组织的。影片通过这些假象力图要人们相信：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是安源工人罢工斗争的“最高领导者”，是工人运动的“权威”。
    然而，虚假的外衣遮不住事实的真相。
    安源的工人运动，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自组织和领导的。早在一九二一年冬天，毛主席就来到安源开辟工作。他深入到工人群众中，启发工人的阶级觉悟，宣传革命道理，号召他们组织起来和资本家当局展开坚决的斗争。毛主席的革命活动和伟大教导，在安源工人心中点燃了革命烈火，为罢工斗争奠定了胜利的思想基础、组织基础和群众基础。罢工斗争前夕，毛主席又亲自到安源，精辟地分析了当时国际国内的形势，指出罢工运动的条件已经成熟，并对罢工斗争作出了英明的指示和部署。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是在罢工运动前夕才到安源的。在安源，他不是执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，而是推行右倾机会主义的投降路线；不是揭露资本家剥削工人的罪恶，而是贩卖“剥削有理”、“资本家养活工人”的黑货；不是宣传阶级和阶级斗争，而是大搞“劳资合作”；不是号召工人起来造反，而是要工人“安分守己”，“竭力维持”“矿局生产”；不是教育工人自己解放自己，而是把希望寄托在资本家的“人心”和“明智”上；不是把工人运动看得“好得很”，而是污蔑为“一意横行”，“聚众喧扰要挟”……，简直是一团糟。所有这一切，充分说明了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派根本不是工人阶级革命利益的代表，而是剥削制度的辩护士；不是工人运动的领导者，而是破坏工人运动的罪魁。
    可是，《燎原》的炮制者，却打着可以“艺术虚构”的幌子，不仅篡改历史，把他的罪行一笔勾销了，而且无中生有，凭空捏造，把我们伟大领袖毛主席的革命活动硬加在他的身上。在影片的制作过程中，修正主义分子周扬一伙，十分阴险地说什么毛主席早期的思想，在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派身上都有。他们拚命反对把毛主席的革命活动搬上银幕，反对出现毛主席的光辉名字和伟大声音，这不仅是为了贬低毛主席，树立党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的“威信”，而且是为了宣扬一种“没有毛主席和毛泽东思想的中国革命”的极端反动的思想，似乎没有毛主席，光靠党内头号野心家也可以进行中国“革命”，革命也可以“胜利”。
    这是彻头彻尾的政治欺骗！毛主席是我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，没有毛主席就没有新中国，就没有社会主义革命的伟大胜利，当然也就没有安源罢工运动的胜利。《燎原》所宣扬的没有毛主席也能革命，也能胜利的道路，是不折不扣的修正主义道路，是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派妄图篡党篡政的反革命阴谋的大暴露！
    《燎原》还不惜采取丑化和污蔑工人阶级的伟大形象，突出党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的个人作用，把他打扮成工人阶级的“救世主”。
    毛主席教导我们“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”可是，影片《燎原》中出现的工人，都是麻木不仁无所作为的“芸芸众生”。他们有的是任人摆布的软骨头；有的是胆小怕事的可怜虫；有的在沉重的压迫和剥削之下，无能为力，只有默默地死去，……好象工人阶级除了忍受压迫和剥削之外，只有死去，别无他路。然而，当雷焕觉，即党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派来了之后，这些“无知无识”的“群氓”心里顿时“亮堂”起来，感到从此有了希望。影片中易老倌说：“这几十年，哪一回闹事情，不是叫矿局一个一个的摆布啊，好不容易来了老雷，……我们才有了主心骨。”影片吹捧雷焕觉
  “有学问”、“有作为”、“有胆识”，“领导”工人取得了罢工“胜利”。在这里，工人们心中没有意识到整个阶级的伟大力量，只有雷焕觉的“英明”；没有党和毛主席的伟大领导，只有雷焕觉这个“主心骨”。他们什么事都是“老雷说的”，“找老雷去”，视他为“恩人”和“救星”，左一个“我们的雷主任”，右一个“我们的代表”，就是不提毛主席和共产党，真是恶毒至极。在谈判时，工人们不是为了打击资本家，而是为了给雷焕觉当保镖；不是为了显示自己的强大力量，而是跟在雷焕觉屁股后面打打旗子，喊喊口号，作雷焕觉的陪衬。更令人不能容忍的是，影片颠倒黑白，竟然把这样一个工贼，描绘成一个和资本家斗争的“英雄”。在前来监视工人夜校的陈工头面前，他是那样威风凛凛，不可侵犯；在郑海生死后那一场工人和资本家面对面斗争的紧急关头，他“挺身而出”，一声喊叫就吓得总监工王连奎放下了举起的手枪；在和资本家谈判那一场戏中，尽管刀枪林立，他却“神色自若”，和一大群武装的敌人展开唇枪舌战，好一副威武的气魄，好一个独胆英雄！
    事情果真如此吗？不！正是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在安源工人的革命烈火面前吓得要死。在他看来，安源罢工斗争是“铤而走险”，是处于“骑虎之势”，迫不得已才行动的。这八个字，画出了这个头号野心家胆小如鼠，色厉内荏的丑恶灵魂！据安源老工人揭露，他当年和资本家谈判时，心惊肉跳，是工人群众保护着他走上谈判楼的，谈判结束后尚惊魂不定，心有余悸。这哪里是一个“一身是胆”的英雄，分明是个“全身是鬼”的草包！联系到他在《修养》中宣扬的活命哲学，联系他在资本家面前卑躬屈膝，乞求剥削的丑态，这个所谓“老革命”的奴才面目就昭然若揭了。
    为党内头号走资本主义道路当权派歌功颂德、树碑立传的反动影片《燎原》出现在一九六二年，决不是偶然的。
    一九六二年，正是我国两个阶级、两条道路的阶级斗争异常尖锐复杂的时候，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻，妄图复辟资本主义。正是在这个时候，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派也披挂上阵，大肆攻击党和毛主席、攻击毛泽东思想，竭力抬高他自己。他说什么“要接受斯大林的教训，不要再突出个人了，不要再喊活着的个人万岁了”，并猖狂叫嚣：“老的不行了嘛，要下台，要让位。”他不但亲自出马，重新抛出了那本反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的《修养》，而且幕后策划，指使其党羽大肆美化和吹捧他。《燎原》正是在这种政治背景下出笼的。十分清楚，它是为党内头号走资本主义道路当权派篡党篡政作舆论准备。
    然而，历史又是何等的无情！毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命打破了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮修正主义分子的迷梦，把他们一个个地揪了出来，这是多么大快人心！“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，我们要在毛主席的领导下，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派！
