Albanian comrades are enthusiastically celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This brilliant work has achieved great victories in guiding the revolutionary arts.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tirana on May 12, Albanian artists are enthusiastically celebrating the 25th anniversary of Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They are hailing the great victories achieved by Mao Zedong's revolutionary line on literature and art.

Albanian painter Voto Stamo told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "Twenty-five years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered the 'Talks,' discussing many extremely important and principled issues in literature and art. He provided a scientific Marxist-Leninist analysis of the path of literary and artistic development, clearly pointing out that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Time has proven that these propositions are extremely correct and have practical significance, and will forever have practical significance. Because these propositions are based on the immortal principles of Marxism-Leninism, they are against bourgeois, feudal, decadent, and revisionist ideologies. Comrade Mao Zedong's propositions express the demand to establish a literature and art that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serves the proletariat and the interests of the proletarian revolution."

He said: "On the basis of Mao Zedong's Marxist-Leninist teachings, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is developing day by day. Chinese literature and art are also developing, uncompromisingly opposing bourgeois and revisionist ideologies, and advancing towards final victory."

Albanian People's Army writer Resul Bembu said: "Twenty-five years have passed since Comrade Mao Zedong delivered the 'Talks.' Mao Zedong's great thoughts are shining brilliantly, guiding Chinese revolutionary writers and artists to create for the people, and illuminating the path for further deepening the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has great historical significance for the fate of the Chinese people and the people of the world."

He said: "Comrade Mao Zedong's work is a great instruction to writers and artists. It teaches them to always be revolutionaries, stand on the side of the working class and the laboring masses, work and live with the laboring people, and create works that are truly beneficial to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and beneficial to the revolution and socialism."

An actor who participated in the performance of the Chinese revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" in Albania, Imril Simidiu (playing Hong Changqing), said: "Comrade Mao Zedong's famous propositions on literature and art in his 'Talks' are very relevant to our current revolutionary era. He said: Mao Zedong's 'Talks' are showing tremendous ideological power in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's 'Talks,' I understand even more that because our Chinese comrades have followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, 'the thoughts and feelings of literary and artistic workers must be fused with those of the workers, peasants, and soldiers,' they have created this revolutionary ballet 'The Red Detachment of Women,' which is loved by workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals. Our artists should always be students of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in life. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, 'Only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses,' and only thus can one create the spiritual food needed by the revolutionary people."

A member of the Albanian State Song and Dance Troupe, singer Lefter Besho, who visited China, said: "We saw in China that literature and art, advancing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, are not only contributing to China's literary and artistic treasures but also to the world's literary and artistic treasures."

    阿尔巴尼亚同志欢呼《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    革命文艺必须为工农兵服务
    据新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚的文艺工作者在毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一光辉著作发表二十五周年的时候，热烈欢呼毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    阿尔巴尼亚画家弗托·斯塔莫对新华社记者说：毛泽东同志在二十五年前发表的《讲话》中谈到了文学艺术中的许多非常重要的原则性的问题，对文学艺术发展的道路作了科学的马克思列宁主义分析，明确指出，文艺应该为工农兵服务。时间证明这些论断是非常正确的，是有现实意义的，而且永远是有现实意义的。因为这些论断是根据不朽的马克思列宁主义原则提出来的，它是反对资产阶级的、封建主义的、颓废的和修正主义的思想的。毛主席的这些论断表达了建立一个为工农兵、为无产阶级和无产阶级革命利益服务的文艺的要求。
    他说：在毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义学说的基础上，中国的无产阶级文化大革命正在日益发展，中国的文艺也在发展，同资产阶级和修正主义思想毫不妥协，向着最后的胜利挺进。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民军部队作家雷苏尔·本布说：毛泽东同志的《讲话》发表到现在，已经二十五年了。毛主席的伟大思想闪耀着光辉，教导着中国革命作家和艺术家为人民而创作，并照亮着进一步深入开展中国无产阶级文化大革命的道路。中国无产阶级文化大革命对中国和世界各国人民的命运具有重大的历史意义。
    他说：毛泽东主席的这部著作是对作家和艺术家的伟大教导。教导他们永远作一个革命者，站在工人阶级和劳动群众的立场上，同劳动人民一起劳动和生活，创造出真正有利于工农兵、有利于革命和社会主义的作品来。
    参加中国革命现代芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》在阿尔巴尼亚演出的演员之一介米尔·西米季乌（扮演剧中的洪常青）说：毛泽东同志在他的《讲话》中提出关于文学艺术的著名论断对我国当前革命化的时代是非常具有现实意义的。他说：毛主席《讲话》正在史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命中显示出巨大的思想威力。我学习了毛泽东同志的《讲话》后，更加懂得，由于我们的中国同志遵循了毛主席的伟大教导：“……文艺工作者的思想感情和工农兵大众的思想感情打成一片”，才创造出了这个为工农兵和革命知识分子所喜闻乐见的革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》。我们的艺术家应该在生活中永远成为工农兵的学生。正象毛泽东同志所说的，“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”，才能创造出革命人民所需要的精神食粮。
    访问中国归来的阿尔巴尼亚国家歌舞团团员、歌唱家列弗特·贝绍说：我们在中国亲眼看到，遵循毛主席指出的方向前进的中国文学和艺术，不仅正在为中国的文艺宝库，而且也在为世界的文艺宝库作出贡献。
