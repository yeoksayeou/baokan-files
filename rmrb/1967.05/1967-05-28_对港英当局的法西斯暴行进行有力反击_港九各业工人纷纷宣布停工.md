On May 26, a large number of Chinese workers in Hong Kong joined the strike to protest against the British colonial authorities' brutal suppression of Hong Kong compatriots.

Workers from the Marine Department, a subsidiary of the British colonial authorities, stopped work for three hours starting at 8 AM. This paralyzed all ships under the department's jurisdiction. For the convenience of residents, medical ships to nearby islands continued to operate. Workers at the berths of Chinese cargo ships also continued their work.

Postal workers announced a one-day strike. During the strike, the delivery of all mail, including that of the British colonial authorities, was completely halted.

Over 500 workers from the outdoor engineering department of the China Light and Power Company stopped work for two hours from 8 AM to 10 AM.

All 300 workers at the Taikoo Sugar Refinery stopped work for 24 hours starting at 8 AM.

Approximately 3,000 workers at the Taikoo Dockyard began a three-hour strike at 1 PM. This was the second strike by workers at this dockyard since the "May 22" incident.

Workers from various industries held anti-persecution struggle meetings within their factories or unions during the strike. The workers were extremely angry about the British colonial authorities' fascist atrocities and expressed their determination to fight to the end, regardless of the sacrifices.

They said, "When we see the fascist thugs brutally beating our compatriots, we are so angry that our eyes burn with rage. We are Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought and will not allow imperialism to bully us." The workers repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Long live the great unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

On May 26, leaflets calling for resistance against persecution appeared in various commercial districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon. They urged Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots to take action under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to strongly resist the British colonial authorities' fascist atrocities.

On May 25, patriotic film workers held a rally in a fervent atmosphere of slogans. Participants solemnly pledged before the portrait of our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao: In response to the call of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee, we will resolutely fight against the British colonial authorities, defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death, and will not retreat until we achieve complete victory.

The participation of various strata of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots in the anti-persecution struggle is becoming increasingly widespread. On May 25, fishermen from Hong Kong Island established an Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee. Patriotic women and patriotic businesspeople in Hong Kong and Kowloon also established their respective Anti-Persecution Struggle Committees.
