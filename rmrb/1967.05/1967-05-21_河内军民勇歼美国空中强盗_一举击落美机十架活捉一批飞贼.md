The heroic military and civilian people of Hanoi, on May 19, in the battle to repel American air pirates, shot down ten American pirate planes in one go and captured a batch of air pirates. The battle was fought very beautifully.

At 10:15 AM on the 19th, when the American air pirates just swooped into the sky over Hanoi, the anti-aircraft guns and other weapons on various positions simultaneously roared at the enemy planes. The fierce and dense firepower shot towards the sky, instantly sending the enemy planes into a chaotic retreat, disrupting their formation.

On the position of the first anti-aircraft artillery company, which has been awarded the title of Heroic Unit, each squad fought fiercely and accurately. When two enemy planes flew in from different directions, the company commander immediately organized firepower, blowing one of them to smithereens.

Some enemy planes sneaked in and indiscriminately launched missiles, but they could not escape the punishment from the gunners defending the heroic capital and the broad masses of militia, and were hit one after another, catching fire.

At 14:30, the American pirate planes once again invaded the sky over Hanoi. An enemy plane swooped into the airspace above the city center, just beginning to dive, and was hit by the dense fire network of the heroic Hanoi military and civilians. It fell from a height of 1,500 meters, crashing onto the streets of Hanoi.

After the alarm was lifted, the people of Hanoi excitedly heard the broadcast of the victory of shooting down multiple American pirate planes. Everyone joyfully cheered for the victory of the battle.

Suddenly someone shouted, "The American air pirates have parachuted down!" The broad masses of military and civilians, who were celebrating the victory, immediately sprang into action to capture the American air pirates. An American air pirate landed in the backyard of a household. A 19-year-old youth from this household immediately ran forward and shouted, "Hands up!" At this moment, many militia self-defense corps members also rushed forward, frightening the air pirate, who was terrified and immediately captured.

Another American air pirate, hanging from a parachute, drifted from the sky over West Lake in Hanoi all the way to Rue Xich. This air pirate, whose left leg was injured by the bullets of the Hanoi military and civilians, finally fell into an alley and was captured by workers who had just returned from work.

At the press conference held by the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army on the 20th, reporters saw with their own eyes the American air pirates captured by the military and civilians of Hanoi yesterday, bowing and pleading for mercy, looking dejected and disheveled. When the heroic Vietnamese People's Army soldiers escorted the two American air pirates out of the venue, the Vietnamese workers, soldiers, and citizens gathered at the entrance of the venue, with great anger, raised their arms and shouted, "Down with American imperialism!"

These two American air pirates are a small part of the large number of American air pirates captured by the military and civilians of Hanoi on the 19th.

    河内军民勇歼美国空中强盗
    一举击落美机十架活捉一批飞贼
    新华社河内二十日电  本社记者报道：英雄的河内市军民，五月十九日在反击美国空中强盗的战斗中，一举击落美国强盗飞机十架，并且活捉了一批飞贼。战斗打得非常漂亮。
    十九日上午十点十五分，当美国空中强盗刚刚窜进河内上空的时候，各个阵地上的高射炮和其他各种武器同时向敌机发出怒吼。猛烈而密集的炮火射向天空，顿时打得敌机狼狈逃窜，乱了队形。
    在荣获英雄单位称号的第一高射炮连的阵地上，各个分队都打得狠，打得准。当两架敌机从不同方向飞来时，连长便立即组织火力，把其中一架打得粉身碎骨。
    一些敌机偷偷地钻进来滥肆发射导弹，但它们逃脱不了保卫英雄首都的炮手们和广大民兵给予的惩罚，纷纷被击中起火。
    十四点三十分，美国强盗飞机再一次侵入河内上空。一架敌机窜进了市中心区上空，刚刚开始俯冲，就被英雄的河内军民的严密火网击中。它带着一身熊熊的烈火，从一千五百米高度掉了下来，坠落在河内市的街道上。
    警报解除后，河内市人民兴奋地听到了打落多架美国强盗飞机的胜利广播。大家兴高采烈地欢呼战斗的胜利。
    突然有人喊着：“美国飞贼跳伞了！”正在欢庆胜利的广大军民又紧急行动起来，捕捉美国飞贼。一个美国飞贼落在一户人家的后院。这户人家的一位十九岁的青年马上跑上前高喊：“举起手来！”这时，许多民兵自卫队员也一起涌上去，吓得这个飞贼，魂飞魄散，当即被擒。
    另一个美国飞贼吊在降落伞上，从河内市西湖上空一直飘到瑞溪街。这个左腿被河内军民的子弹打伤的强盗，最后掉到一条胡同里，被刚下班回来的工人活捉。
    在越南人民军总司令部二十日举行的记者招待会上，记者亲眼看到了昨天被河内市军民活捉的美国飞贼鞠躬求饶，垂头丧气的狼狈相。当英雄的越南人民军战士押解着两名美国飞贼离开会场时，聚集在会场门口的越南工人、战士和市民，以极大的愤怒，振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”
    这两名美国飞贼是河内市军民十九日活捉的大批美国飞贼中的一小部分。
