Thousands of British workers took to the streets of London on Sunday, May 7th, to celebrate May Day and protest against American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The demonstration concluded with a mass rally in Hyde Park.

Among the crowd, protesters carried a giant portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the peoples of the world. As they marched, the demonstrators chanted slogans such as "U.S. imperialism out of Vietnam!" "Imperialism get out!" and "Wilson get out!" Many protesters also held signs condemning British aggression in South Yemen.

At a temporary bookstall set up near the entrance of Hyde Park, hundreds of copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," "Peking Review," and "Chinese Pictorial" were quickly sold out.

Today, a group of young workers visited the grave of Karl Marx, laying a wreath and singing "The Internationale." A young worker gave a brief speech at Marx's grave, stating that after Lenin's death, it was Chairman Mao Zedong who further developed the Marxism-Leninism of our era. He emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China represents a significant advance by the Chinese people on the socialist road.

    新华社伦敦七日电　数千名英国工人七日利用星期天休息的时间在伦敦的主要街道上举行示威游行，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南。游行结束后，在海德公园举行群众大会。
    在群众队伍中，示威者高举着一幅全世界人民伟大导师毛主席的巨型画像。示威群众沿途高呼：“美帝国主义滚出越南！”“帝国主义滚出去！”“威尔逊滚出去！”等口号，许多示威者还举着谴责英国侵略南也门的标语牌。
    在海德公园门前的临时售书处，好几百本《毛主席语录》、《北京周报》、《中国画报》很快就被购买一空。
    今天，一批青年工人前往卡尔·马克思墓前敬献花圈，并且高唱《国际歌》。一个青年工人在马克思墓前发表简短的讲话。他说，在列宁逝世以后，是毛泽东主席进一步发展了我们时代的马克思列宁主义学说。他指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命是中国人民在社会主义道路上的大步迈进。
