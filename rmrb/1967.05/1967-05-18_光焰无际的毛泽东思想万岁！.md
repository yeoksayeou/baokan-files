On May 16, 1966, our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the drafting of the CCP Central Committee's "Notice," igniting the torch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Over the past year, the brilliant practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has once again conclusively proven that our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, and that great Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation.

The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The CCP Central Committee's "Notice" pronounced the death sentence on the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee led by Peng Zhen. At the same time, it exposed the conspiracy of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are not willing to accept their defeat. They continue to fiercely oppose the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, struggling desperately. After Chairman Mao personally directed the drafting of the CCP Central Committee's "Notice," he then personally approved the broadcast of the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism at Peking University, igniting the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the nation. Seeing the situation was not in their favor, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road hurriedly put forth the bourgeois reactionary line, using the power they had usurped to dispatch large numbers of "firefighting teams"—work teams—to try to extinguish the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at our Tsinghua University was once brutally suppressed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They sent a work team of over 500 people, labeling over 800 revolutionary masses at Tsinghua University as "counter-revolutionaries," "pseudo-leftists," and "real rightists," and labeling the majority of cadres as "black gangs," implementing the reactionary policy of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group." For a time, white terror shrouded the entire Tsinghua University. However, the revolutionary young soldiers of Tsinghua University were not frightened or subdued; we firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "When dark clouds appear in the sky, we point out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, darkness is about to pass, and dawn is just ahead." We raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and waged an unyielding struggle against the counter-revolutionary forces. Through repeated struggles and many confrontations, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line achieved decisive victory, the bourgeois reactionary line failed, and the Khrushchev-like figures sleeping beside us were dragged out.

The practice of struggle made us realize the great truth that the fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the question of power remains the most important question. Without the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, without dragging out the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, there is the danger of capitalist restoration. This is what Chairman Mao taught us, this is Chairman Mao's greatest new development of Marxism-Leninism.

The revolutionary young soldiers of the Tsinghua University Jian Gangshan Corps have now taken power. The sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines over Tsinghua University. The tasks before us are still very heavy. On one hand, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are not reconciled to their defeat and are waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. We must heighten our vigilance and be prepared at any time to repel the capitalist restoration tide; on the other hand, now that we have taken power, our position has changed, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never detach ourselves from the masses, always be with the masses, humbly be the students of the masses, and carry the revolution through to the end. At present, we must unite with all revolutionary teachers, students, staff, and revolutionary cadres of the entire school, direct our spearheads at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre issue, consolidate the revolutionary great alliance of our school, and strive for the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

"Though the pass be beset with iron, we will march on, step by step, from the very beginning." Looking back at the past, under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, we fought our way out of the white terror. Looking at the present, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminates a very good revolutionary situation across the nation. Looking to the future, the radiant Mao Zedong Thought illuminates an extremely bright future. With boundless proletarian revolutionary enthusiasm, we swear to follow our most, most great leader Chairman Mao to the end, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought!

    光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！
    北京市革命委员会常委  清华大学井冈山兵团负责人  蒯大富
    一九六六年五月十六日，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央的《通知》，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的火炬。一年来，无产阶级文化大革命的光辉实践，再次雄辩地证明了：我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，伟大的毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路。中共中央的《通知》，宣告了以彭真为首的旧北京市委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的死刑。同时，揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏无产阶级文化大革命的阴谋。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派并不甘心于他们的失败，他们继续疯狂地反对党中央和毛主席，进行垂死的挣扎。毛主席亲自主持制定中共中央的《通知》以后，接着又亲自批准广播北京大学第一张马列主义大字报，在全国范围内点起了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派见势不妙，急急忙忙抛出资产阶级反动路线，利用他们窃据的权力，派出大量的“消防队”——工作组，企图扑灭我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。
    我们清华大学的无产阶级文化大革命，就曾受到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的野蛮摧残。他派了一个五百多人的工作组，把清华大学的八百多名革命群众打成“反革命”“假左派”“真右派”，把大多数干部打成“黑帮”，实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策。一时，白色恐怖笼罩着整个清华大学。但是，清华大学的革命小将没有被吓倒，没有被压服；我们牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“当着天空中出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。”我们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，向反革命势力进行了不屈不挠的斗争。经过反复的斗争，多次的较量，毛主席的革命路线取得了决定性的胜利，资产阶级反动路线失败了，睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫式的人物被揪出来了。
    斗争的实践，使我们认识到革命的根本问题是政权问题这一伟大真理。在无产阶级专政的条件下，政权问题仍然是头等重要的问题，不进行无产阶级文化大革命，不揪出党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，就存在资本主义复辟的危险。这是毛主席教导我们的，这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义最伟大的新发展。
    我们清华大学井冈山兵团的革命小将现在已经掌权了。毛泽东思想的阳光普照着清华园。我们面临的任务还是很重很重的。一方面，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不甘心他们的失败，还在伺机反扑，我们一定要提高警惕，随时准备击退资本主义复辟逆流；另一方面，我们掌权了，地位发生了变化，一定要牢记毛主席的教导，一刻也不脱离群众，永远和群众在一起，虚心做群众的学生，把革命进行到底。当前，我们要和全校的革命师生员工、革命干部团结在一起，把矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，巩固我们学校的革命大联合，为实现革命的“三结合”而奋斗。
    “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”想想过去，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，我们从白色恐怖中杀了出来。看看现在，战无不胜的毛泽东思想，照耀着全国一片大好的革命形势。展望将来，光芒万丈的毛泽东思想照耀着无比美好的前程。我们满怀无产阶级的革命豪情，誓死跟着我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想万岁！
