China is truly carrying out a great revolution on the cultural front, proving that China is not only the vanguard of the communist world on the political and economic fronts but also on the cultural front. Every communist in the world must pay attention to this movement and enthusiastically support it.

The Communist Party of China is engaged in a great undertaking that no one has ever done before. The Soviet revisionists have long betrayed the communist cause, and communists from all countries no longer look to it, but are joyfully looking to Beijing, looking to the great leader of the world proletariat, Mao Zedong.

Please rest assured, we will do everything in our power to spread the significance of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in Germany. Please believe that American imperialism does not have as many friends in our country as they boast. Marx was born in our country, many communists sacrificed themselves in Nazi concentration camps, and German communists are revolutionary. We will not rest until we complete the proletarian revolution in our country.

Comrade Mao Zedong is a great example for fighters for communism. We will always listen to Mao Zedong, just as you do, and act according to his instructions.

West Germany, Kùbǐyàkè Guó

    中国不愧是共产主义先锋
    中国正在进行文化战线上的伟大革命，证明了中国不仅在政治战线和经济战线上，而且在文化战线上都不愧是共产主义世界的先锋。全世界每个共产主义者都必须重视这个运动，并热情支持它。
    中国共产党正在从事着前人从未做过的伟大事业。苏联修正主义者早已背叛了共产主义事业，世界各国共产党人再也不注视它，而欢欣鼓舞地注视着北京，注视着世界无产阶级的伟大领袖毛泽东。
    请你们放心，我们将尽一切努力在德国传播中国文化大革命的意义。请你们相信，美帝国主义在我们国家远不象他们吹嘘的那样有那么多朋友。马克思生长在我们国家里，许多共产党人曾牺牲在纳粹的集中营里，德国共产党人是要革命的。我们不在我国完成无产阶级革命，死不瞑目。
    毛泽东同志是为共产主义而奋斗的战士的伟大榜样。我们要象你们那样永远听毛泽东的话，按照他的指示办事。
