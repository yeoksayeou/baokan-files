Title: Using "Public" as a Pretext for "Private" Interests

The top capitalist-roader within the Party, cloaked in the guise of Marxism-Leninism, peddles the private interests of the bourgeoisie. In his book *On Cultivation*, which runs to tens of thousands of words, under the guise of phrases like "the Party's interests" and "revolutionary interests," he expounds on "personal goals," "personal development," "personal future," and "personal life and health." He advocates that one should "develop oneself" within the context of the Party's interests and development, and that personal interests should "completely dissolve" into the Party's interests.

On one hand, there are "the Party's interests," and on the other, "personal development" and "personal future." It seems like a balance of public and private interests; in reality, "the Party's interests" is just a cover, while "personal development" and "personal future" are the true goals. The name is "public," but the reality is "private."

Is it for the public or for the private? This is a fundamental contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a clash of two opposing worldviews. In the face of the enemy's bayonets, is it to sacrifice oneself for the revolution or to betray and surrender for personal survival? When faced with heavy burdens, is it to bravely shoulder them for the revolution or to shirk responsibilities for personal gain? It is either one or the other. There is no room for compromise, and it is impossible to "merge the two."

The top capitalist-roader within the Party's theory of "merging public and private interests" is nothing but a deceitful lie. In reality, it is a cover for "private" interests, using "private" to corrupt "public," giving "private" interests a legitimate position, allowing bourgeois individualism to run rampant, corrupting the revolutionary spirit of Party members and the masses, turning them into extreme egoists who prioritize "private" interests, and ultimately transforming our great Party into a revisionist Party, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism in China.

We, the working class, do not believe in this deceit. Chairman Mao teaches us to "serve the people wholeheartedly" and to "put the people's interests first, not the interests of individuals or small groups." We must follow Chairman Mao's words, study and apply his works, use the "Three Articles" to transform our worldview, thoroughly criticize and repudiate the reactionary fallacies spread by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and let the boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong occupy all ideological positions.

### 借为“公”之名，行为“私”之实

    借为“公”之名，行为“私”之实
    北京市第二机床厂　陈运威　张秀生
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，披着马列主义的外衣，大肆贩卖资产阶级个人主义的私货。在他那本洋洋几万字的《修养》里，在“党的利益”、“革命的利益”等冠冕堂皇的词句掩盖下，大讲其“个人的目的”、“个人的发展”、“个人的前途”、“个人的生命与健康”等等。宣扬什么要在党的利益与党的发展中，“来发展自己”，个人利益和党的利益，要“完全溶化”。
    一方面是“党的利益”，一方面是“个人的发展”、“个人的前途”，看起来，公私兼顾；实际上，“党的利益”不过是个幌子，“个人的发展”、“个人的前途”才是真正的目的；为“公”是名，为“私”是实。
    为公，还是为私，这是无产阶级和资产阶级根本对立的两种世界观，是水火不相容的。在敌人的刺刀面前，是为了革命不惜牺牲自己，还是为了个人活命而叛变投降？在艰苦的担子面前，是为了革命勇敢地挑重担子，还是为了个人拈轻怕重？不是前者，就是后者。这里，没有任何调和的余地，绝不能“合二而一”。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所贩卖的“公私溶化”论，完全是骗人的鬼话。实际上是为“私”字打掩护，以“私”化“公”，让“私”字取得合法地位，让资产阶级个人主义任意泛滥，腐蚀党员群众的革命灵魂，把他们变成处处为“私”的极端利己主义者，进而把我们伟大的党变成修正主义的党，为在中国实现资本主义复辟准备条件。
    我们工人阶级是不信他这套鬼话的。毛主席教导我们，“全心全意地为人民服务”，“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发。”我们一定听毛主席的话，活学活用毛主席著作，用“老三篇”改造自己的世界观，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所散布的反动谬论，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地。
