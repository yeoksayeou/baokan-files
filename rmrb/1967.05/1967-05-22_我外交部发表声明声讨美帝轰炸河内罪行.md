The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on May 21st condemning the U.S. imperialists' despicable act of sending warplanes to continuously bomb the capital city of Hanoi in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The statement expresses resolute support for the principled stance of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry in its May 19th statement. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
May 21, 1967

Recently, U.S. warplanes have continuously bombed the capital city of Hanoi in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, particularly on May 19th when they carried out two rounds of indiscriminate bombing on the city, committing heinous crimes against the Vietnamese people. The Chinese government and people vehemently condemn the banditry of U.S. imperialism and resolutely support the principled stance of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry in its May 19th statement.

The heroic people of Hanoi have struck back fiercely against the invading U.S. planes, shooting down ten U.S. warplanes on May 19th alone and capturing a batch of U.S. air pirates. The Chinese people warmly applaud the brilliant victory achieved by the Vietnamese people.

Currently, the situation in the Vietnamese people's war against the U.S. is excellent. The people of South Vietnam have defeated the U.S. imperialists' "dry season offensive" and "pacification plan," and have launched a powerful offensive against the U.S. invading army, achieving one major victory after another. The Vietnamese people firmly grasp the initiative in the war, while the U.S. invading army is on the defensive everywhere, in a very miserable situation. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last-ditch struggle." The continuous bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong by U.S. imperialism does not indicate its strength but rather its weakness.

The U.S. imperialists are escalating their war against North Vietnam in a desperate attempt to salvage their failing situation in South Vietnam. However, this attempt is doomed to fail. As pointed out in the statement by the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry: the more frantically the U.S. expands the war, the more it arouses the Vietnamese people's deep hatred against the U.S. aggressors. The Vietnamese people will resolutely fight to the end for a complete victory under any circumstances. The U.S. imperialists' frantic expansion of their war of aggression against Vietnam will meet the same fate as a wild cow charging into a fire, ultimately being burned to death by the flames of the Vietnamese people's war.

It is noted that while the U.S. imperialists are escalating their aggression against Vietnam and indiscriminately bombing Hanoi, Washington, Moscow, and London are engaged in a dirty deal. British Foreign Secretary Brown will visit Moscow on May 23rd, during the "Buddha's Birthday" ceasefire in Vietnam, in an attempt to stage another farce of U.S., British, and Soviet collusion to pressure Vietnam into "peace talks." However, just as the U.S. imperialists have suffered shameful defeats on the battlefield, their political conspiracy will also fail.

The peoples of China and Vietnam are brothers and comrades-in-arms. We warn the U.S. imperialists: the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are fully prepared for the U.S. imperialists' escalation of aggression. The Chinese people's resolve to fight the U.S. imperialists to the end is unshakable, and so is their resolve to support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression. The Vietnamese people will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve ultimate victory!

### 我外交部发表声明声讨美帝轰炸河内罪行

    我外交部发表声明声讨美帝轰炸河内罪行
    中国人民支援越南抗美救国战争的决心是下定了的
    美帝扩大战争“升级”行动必将失败；美苏英勾结再次压越“和谈”的政治阴谋绝不能得逞
    新华社二十一日讯　我国外交部二十一日发表声明，愤怒声讨美帝国主义派遣强盗飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市的滔天罪行，并表示坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部五月十九日声明的严正立场。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
                      一九六七年五月二十一日
    最近以来，美国强盗飞机连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市，特别是五月十九日两次对河内市区进行狂轰滥炸，对越南人民犯下了滔天罪行。中国政府和中国人民愤怒声讨美帝国主义的强盗行径，坚决支持越南民主共和国外交部五月十九日声明的严正立场。
    英雄的河内人民，对来犯的美机予以迎头痛击，五月十九日一天就击落美国强盗飞机十架，并生擒一批美国飞贼。中国人民热烈欢呼越南人民所取得的这一辉煌战果。
    当前，越南人民抗美战争的形势好得很。越南南方人民打败了美帝国主义的“旱季攻势”和“绥靖计划”，并且向美国侵略军发动了强大的攻势，取得了一个又一个的重大胜利。越南人民牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权，美国侵略军处处被动挨打，处境十分狼狈。毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”美帝国主义连续轰炸河内、海防，并不说明它的强大，正是它虚弱的表现。
    美帝国主义加紧扩大对越南北方的战争“升级”行动，就是妄图以此来挽救它在越南南方的败局。但是，美国的这种企图是绝对不能得逞的。正如越南民主共和国外交部声明所指出的：美国越是疯狂地扩大战争，就越激起越南人民对美国侵略强盗的刻骨仇恨，越南人民在任何情况下都将坚决战斗到彻底胜利。美帝国主义疯狂扩大侵略越南的战争，就象一匹冲入火阵的野牛一样，终将被越南人民战争的烈火烧死。
    人们注意到，正当美帝国主义扩大侵略越南、滥肆轰炸河内的时候，华盛顿、莫斯科和伦敦正在进行着一笔肮脏的交易。英国外交大臣布朗，将于五月二十三日，即正当“释迦牟尼诞辰”越南停火的时候，访问莫斯科，妄图使今年春节期间美、英、苏勾结压越“和谈”的丑剧再度上演。但是，正象美帝国主义在战场上遭到可耻失败一样，它们的这一政治阴谋，也是不能得逞的。
    中越两国人民是唇齿相依的兄弟和战友。我们要警告美帝国主义：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，对于美帝国主义扩大侵略战争，是早已做了准备的。中国人民同美帝国主义斗争到底的决心是下定了的，中国人民支援兄弟的越南人民抗美救国战争的决心也是下定了的。越南人民必将彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后胜利！
