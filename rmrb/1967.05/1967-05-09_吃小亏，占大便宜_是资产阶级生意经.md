	“Taking small losses, gaining big profits” is the bourgeois business philosophy.

	The top capitalist-roader in the Party, in his book “Self-Cultivation,” says: “A person who truly cultivates himself is absolutely not concerned with his position and reputation within the Party. … However, precisely because he does this, precisely because he is always upright and loyal, brave and steadfast in the revolutionary struggle, and has demonstrated outstanding abilities, he can win the conscious respect and support of Party members and the masses.”

	In another speech, he even more blatantly spouts nonsense, saying: “Those who think about themselves all day long will have no self. Those who do not think about personal interests will ultimately have personal interests. Taking small profits, suffering big losses; suffering small losses, gaining big profits—this is in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview.”

	How shameless! Where is there a single trace of Marxism-Leninism in this tone? It is completely the face of a capitalist chasing after fame and profit! Where is there any talk of a proletarian worldview? It is clearly a thoroughgoing bourgeois philistine philosophy!

	“Taking small losses, gaining big profits” is not some new trick. It is a business philosophy stolen from the bourgeoisie. Those who have lived in the old society will remember: during festivals and holidays, capitalists would always hold “big sales” and “big discounts”; when new stores opened, they would also hold “buy one, get one free” and “××% off sales,” with endless tricks and pretenses. Do capitalists really do business at a loss? Nonsense! For capitalists, there is only the principle of “one investment, ten returns,” and there is no such thing as a loss. The capitalists’ tricks are all for the purpose of attracting customers, building a reputation, and “setting a long line to catch a big fish.” Losing a little today is precisely to make more profits in the future.

	The top capitalist-roader in the Party has brought this capitalist business philosophy into our revolutionary ranks. He waves the banner of “self-cultivation,” pretending to care about the youth and cadres, and spreads this fallacious theory of “taking small losses, gaining big profits” among cadres and youth. In essence, it is to lead people to use a bourgeois business attitude towards the revolution, to suffer a little today so that they can ride on the people’s heads as officials and lords tomorrow! If we follow this bourgeois business philosophy of “self-cultivation,” it can only lead to becoming more “cultivated” and more “self-cultivated,” ultimately turning into thoroughgoing revisionists!

	We must thoroughly criticize and expose the reactionary fallacies propagated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party that poison cadres and youth!

### “吃小亏，占大便宜”是资产阶级生意经

    “吃小亏，占大便宜”是资产阶级生意经
    北京市第二机床厂　张岩　姚进
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，在他的《修养》里说：真正刻苦修养的人，“他绝不计较自己在党内地位和声誉的高低，……然而，正因为他这样做，正因为他在革命斗争中始终是正直忠诚，英勇坚定，并且表现了卓越的能力，他就能够受到党员群众自觉的尊重和拥护。”
    在另外一篇谈话里，他更加露骨地胡说什么：“整天考虑个人即不会有个人。不考虑个人利益则最后有个人利益。占小便宜，吃大亏，吃小亏，占大便宜，这是合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的。”
    真是恬不知耻！这副腔调那里有一丝一毫马列主义的气味，完全是一个追名逐利的资本家的嘴脸！那里谈得上什么无产阶级世界观，分明是地地道道的资产阶级市侩哲学！
    “吃小亏，占大便宜”，并不是什么新鲜玩艺，这是从资产阶级那里贩来的生意经。在旧社会生活过的人都会记得：逢年过节，资本家总要搞什么“大减价”、“大甩卖”；商店新开张的时候，也要搞什么“买一送一”、“××折贱卖”，花样翻新，煞有介事。难道资本家真的会干赔本生意吗？笑话！对于资本家来说，只有一个“一本万利”的原则，根本不存在什么赔本的问题。资本家的这一套鬼花样，完全是为了拉主顾，闯牌子，“放长线，钓大鱼。”这次少赚点，正是为了今后赚得更多。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，把这套资本家的生意经，原封不动地搬到我们革命队伍里来了。他打着“修养”的招牌，装作关心青年、关心干部的样子，在干部和青年中，到处散布这套“吃小亏，占大便宜”的谬论。说穿了，就是要引导人们用资产阶级作生意的态度来对待革命，今天暂时吃点苦，明天好骑在人民头上做官当老爷！要照他这一套资产阶级的生意经“修养”下去，只能是越“养”越“修”，最后非变成地地道道的修正主义分子不可！
    对于党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派宣扬的这套毒害干部、毒害青年的反动谬论，我们一定要把它彻底批臭，彻底肃清！
