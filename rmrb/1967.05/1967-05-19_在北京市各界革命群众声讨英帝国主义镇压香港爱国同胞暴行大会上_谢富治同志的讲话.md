Revolutionary comrades, fellow fighters, and Red Guards!

First of all, let us wish our dearest and most beloved Red Sun, our greatest leader Chairman Mao, eternal life and eternal health! Let us wish our Vice Chairman Lin eternal health and everlasting good health!

In the past few days, the revolutionary masses of all circles in the capital have held demonstrations and marches to protest against the armed suppression of our Hong Kong patriots by the British authorities in Hong Kong. Today, we are holding this rally to denounce the fascist atrocities of British imperialism. I represent the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses of the capital to express our most enthusiastic and resolute support for this rally.

Since May 6, the British authorities in Hong Kong have used the labor dispute at the New Kowloon Plastic Flower Factory as an excuse to dispatch large numbers of military police and thugs for more than ten days to suppress and persecute Chinese workers, students, journalists, and residents in Hong Kong. Many people have been injured, and one person has already died from severe injuries. By the morning of May 14, more than 400 people had been arrested, and more than 100 of them had been unjustly sentenced to imprisonment. Yesterday, the British authorities in Hong Kong dispatched six companies of police to suppress thousands of Chinese patriots in Kowloon and continue their persecution. The situation is still escalating.

The fascist atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong have incurred new blood debts to our Hong Kong patriots and the 700 million Chinese people. This is a brazen provocation against the great Chinese people, and we must resolutely strike back.

In this struggle against the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong, the Chinese workers and residents in Hong Kong, who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have fought bravely and tenaciously. They have greatly carried forward the glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism and are truly outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Their struggle is just! Their struggle is excellent! On behalf of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses of the capital, I extend my warmest greetings to the patriots in Hong Kong! We firmly support their just struggle and pledge to be their reliable backing.

We firmly support the protest statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 15, and we are determined to carry on the struggle against the fascist persecution of British imperialism to the end, together with the patriots in Hong Kong!

The large-scale atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong this time were premeditated. This is part of the conspiracy of British imperialism in collusion with the American imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits to oppose the Chinese people. It is also part of their counter-revolutionary measures to use violence to suppress the spread of the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought.

For a long time, the British authorities in Hong Kong have been taking various measures to intensify their hostility towards China. Especially since the launch of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the British authorities in Hong Kong have held several military and police exercises to oppose China, attempting to use high-pressure tactics to resist the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The large-scale suppression they carried out this time using the labor dispute at the New Kowloon Plastic Flower Factory as an excuse is a major exposure of their evil plan.

The workers at the New Kowloon Plastic Flower Factory in Hong Kong fought against the exploitation of the bosses, which is an objective law of class struggle that cannot be changed by human will. Where there is exploitation, there is oppression, and where there is oppression, there is resistance. Before the incident at the flower factory, Hong Kong had already seen several workers' struggles against capitalists, all of which were won through the resolute struggle of Chinese workers. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong, unwilling to accept their defeat, attempted to extinguish the flames of class struggle that had just been ignited and to suppress the burgeoning workers' movement, thus committing this savage fascist atrocity.

In this atrocity, the British authorities in Hong Kong incited and utilized a large number of Kuomintang spies and triad members as their henchmen to persecute the patriots in Hong Kong. In recent days, the Kuomintang newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan have openly clamored for the Kuomintang spies in Hong Kong to "assist" the British authorities in Hong Kong in "jointly opposing" the workers. Their coordination is not accidental. For many years, British imperialism has not only harbored Kuomintang elements in their propaganda to viciously attack and slander our socialist system and revolutionary movements but also allowed Kuomintang spies to use Hong Kong as a base to infiltrate the mainland of China to carry out sabotage and disruption activities. The British authorities in Hong Kong have also openly allowed Kuomintang elements to carry out "two Chinas" activities in Hong Kong. All of this is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people!

In the past two or three years, the British Labour Party government, in order to support and cooperate with the American imperialists' aggression against Vietnam, has disregarded the strong opposition of Hong Kong residents and the repeated solemn warnings of the Chinese government. They have been providing Hong Kong as a base for the U.S. Navy and Air Force to operate in their aggression against Vietnam. They have allowed the U.S. military to procure the logistics and supplies needed for their aggression against Vietnam in Hong Kong. They have approved the establishment of U.S.-related military factories and enterprises in Hong Kong. They have allowed the U.S. to set up a vast intelligence system and spy agencies in Hong Kong. The British government has also actively followed the U.S. in its conspiracy to militarily encircle China and has even attempted to form a new holy alliance with U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism to oppose China. All of these criminal activities of the British government have completely exposed their shameful role as the henchmen of U.S. imperialism. However, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere, no matter how much the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union strengthen their collusion, their counter-revolutionary sabotage against China will definitely not deviate from the logic that Chairman Mao said: "Make trouble, fail; make trouble again, fail again; until they are utterly destroyed."

Comrades and fellow fighters!

The large-scale bloody atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong this time occurred precisely at the critical moment when our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a decisive battle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. This is because our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already achieved great victories and will achieve even greater victories. British imperialism, like all imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries in various countries, is terrified and hates our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to death. They are trying every means to limit and block the great influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are trying every means to suppress the growing anti-imperialist and patriotic fighting spirit of our patriots in Hong Kong. They arbitrarily restrict and obstruct the mass movement of learning from Chairman Mao's works and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, which is vigorously developing among our patriots in Hong Kong, and attempt to extinguish the flames of truth of Mao Zedong Thought that have been ignited among the Chinese people in Hong Kong. They collude with the reactionary forces of the U.S. and the Kuomintang, mobilize all reactionary newspapers in Hong Kong, and viciously slander and defame our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They do not allow the screening of our film "East Is Red" and films reflecting our three nuclear tests in Hong Kong. They restrict the patriots in Hong Kong from holding revolutionary cultural performances, arbitrarily censor the performance programs, and brutally ban performances reflecting the heroic deeds of Wang Jie and the victory of the struggle of the Chinese people in Macau against the Portuguese authorities in Macau. They regard the patriots carrying "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as a "heinous crime," and brutally send police and spies to search and inspect, and once found, they arrest and imprison them, and torture them. The British authorities in Hong Kong even persecute primary school students wearing Chairman Mao's badges and young children singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman." All of this shows that British imperialists, like rats fearing the sunlight, fear Mao Zedong Thought. Their actions are simply stupid to the extreme and barbaric to the extreme.

We solemnly declare: The activities of the Chinese people in Hong Kong in learning, propagating, implementing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought are absolutely justified and inviolable. The British authorities in Hong Kong have no reason to interfere. The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the whole world. Anyone who dares to try to stop the irresistible influence of Mao Zedong Thought will surely be defeated.

In the more than ten days of struggle against the atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong, the patriotic workers, students, journalists, and other residents in Hong Kong have been learning from and applying Chairman Mao's works in their struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm themselves. Therefore, they dare to fight and are good at fighting. Facing the fully armed military police thugs of British imperialism, they are fearless. They shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" They recite quotations from Chairman Mao, sing revolutionary songs, and use big-character posters as a new weapon. They have displayed the invincible and tremendous power of Mao Zedong Thought. The patriots in Hong Kong have a glorious tradition of more than a hundred years of anti-imperialist struggle. The famous 1925 Hong Kong general strike wrote a glorious page in the history of the world revolutionary workers' struggle. Today, the Chinese workers and residents in Hong Kong, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, are even more indomitable and unyielding.

Comrades and fellow fighters!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." The cunning British imperialists are now stubbornly playing various tricks to deal with the just struggle of our patriots in Hong Kong. The British authorities in Hong Kong have not only failed to apologize publicly and immediately accept all the solemn demands put forward by our government in the statement but are also mobilizing military police, colluding with U.S. and Kuomintang spies, preparing for more large-scale persecution and suppression, and playing various soft and hard, threatening, deceiving, and splitting tactics to try to extinguish the flames of the just struggle of our patriots in Hong Kong. They even foolishly think that China is busy with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and has no time to care about the just struggle of the Chinese people in Hong Kong. The British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have completely miscalculated and chosen the wrong target. The Chinese people, tempered by a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are stronger than ever before. We must warn the utterly foolish British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong to be smart. Since you have committed serious crimes against the Chinese people in Hong Kong, you must honestly take responsibility to all the Chinese residents in Hong Kong and make an explanation; otherwise, you must bear all the serious consequences.

Finally, let us shout:

Strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong!

Salute to the heroic struggle of the patriots in Hong Kong!

Firmly support the just struggle of our patriots in Hong Kong!

Down with American imperialism!

Down with British imperialism!

Down with Soviet modern revisionism!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    在北京市各界革命群众声讨英帝国主义镇压香港爱国同胞暴行大会上
    谢富治同志的讲话
    革命的同志们、战友们、红卫兵小将们：
    首先，让我们敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最伟大的领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！敬祝我们的林副主席身体健康，永远健康！
    这几天，首都各界革命群众怀着无比愤慨的心情，举行了抗议香港英国当局武装镇压我香港爱国同胞的示威游行。今天，我们在这里举行大会，愤怒声讨英帝国主义者的法西斯暴行。我代表北京市革命委员会和首都革命群众，对大会表示最热烈、最坚决的支持。
    从五月六日到现在，香港英国当局以新蒲岗人造塑胶花工厂发生劳资纠纷为借口，连续十多天，出动大批军警暴徒，对香港的中国工人、青年学生、新闻记者和居民进行了武装镇压和迫害。许多人被打伤，其中一人已经伤重身死。截至五月十四日早晨，被逮捕的群众达到四百多人，其中一百多人被无理判处徒刑。昨天，港英当局又出动了六个连的警察，对九龙数千名中国爱国同胞横加镇压，继续迫害。目前事态仍在扩大中。
    香港英国当局一手制造的法西斯暴行，对我香港爱国同胞和七亿中国人民欠下了新的血债。这是对伟大的中国人民的狂妄挑衅，我们必须坚决回击。
    在这次反对香港英国当局暴行的斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的香港中国工人和居民，英勇顽强，坚贞不屈。他们大大地发扬了反帝爱国的光荣传统，不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女。他们的斗争是正义的！他们的斗争好得很！我代表北京市革命委员会和首都革命群众，向香港的爱国同胞热烈致敬！我们坚决支持他们的正义斗争，誓做他们的后盾。
    我们坚决拥护我国外交部五月十五日的抗议声明，决心同香港的爱国同胞一道，把反对英帝国主义法西斯迫害的斗争，进行到底！
    香港英国当局这次制造的大规模暴行，是蓄谋已久的。这是英帝国主义勾结美帝、蒋匪，反对中国人民的阴谋的一部分，也是它妄想使用暴力镇压来遏阻伟大的毛泽东思想的影响扩大的反革命措施的一部分。
    长期以来，香港英国当局就在不断加强敌视中国的种种措施。特别是自我国无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，香港英国当局曾经多次举行敌视中国的军警演习，妄图以高压手段来抵制我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响。这次香港英国当局利用新蒲岗人造塑胶花工厂劳资纠纷所进行的大规模镇压，就是这种罪恶计划的大暴露。
    香港新蒲岗人造塑胶花厂工人为反对资方加强剥削，进行了斗争，这是不以人的意志为转移的阶级斗争的客观规律。那里有剥削，有压迫，那里就有反抗。在花厂事件以前，香港就爆发过多次工人反对资本家的斗争，都在中国工人的坚决斗争下取得了胜利。但是，香港英国当局不甘心于自己的失败，企图把刚刚点燃的工人阶级斗争的烈火扑灭，把方兴未艾的工人运动打下去，从而制造了这次野蛮的法西斯暴行。
    香港英国当局在这次暴行中，纵容和利用了大批蒋帮特务和黑社会分子，作为爪牙，来迫害香港爱国同胞。香港和台湾的蒋帮报刊这几天公然叫嚣，要在香港的蒋帮特务“协助”香港英国当局“共同对抗”工人。他们双方配合得这么密切，决不是偶然的。多年以来，英帝国主义不仅包庇蒋帮分子在宣传上恶毒地攻击、诽谤我国社会主义制度和革命群众运动，而且还听任蒋帮特务利用香港作为潜入中国大陆从事骚扰破坏活动的基地。香港英国当局还公然许可蒋帮分子在香港放肆进行“两个中国”的活动。所有这一切，都是中国人民绝对不能容忍的！
    近二、三年来，英国工党政府为了支持和配合美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，不顾香港居民的强烈反对，不顾中国政府的多次严正警告，一直在把香港提供给美国作为它侵越海军和空军的活动基地。他们容许美军在香港搜刮侵越战争所需要的后勤补给和物资供应。他们批准美国在香港建立和军需有关的工厂企业。他们纵容美国在香港设立庞大的情报系统和特务机构。英国政府还积极追随美国进行军事包围中国的阴谋活动，而且妄图同美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义结成一个反华的新神圣同盟。英国政府的这一切罪恶活动，完全暴露了它充当美帝国主义帮凶的可耻面目。但是，不论是在香港或在其他地方，不管美、英、苏如何加强勾结，对中国进行反革命的捣乱，他们决不会违背毛主席所说的“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的逻辑。
    同志们，战友们！
    香港英国当局这次制造的大规模血腥暴行，恰恰发生在我国无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级，两条道路，两条路线决战的关键时刻。这是因为我国的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，并且还要取得更大的胜利。英帝国主义同一切帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派一样，对我国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要命，恨得要死。他们千方百计地企图限制和封锁我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响。他们千方百计地企图压制我香港爱国同胞不断增长的反帝爱国的战斗精神。他们蛮横无理地限制和阻挠我香港爱国同胞正在蓬勃展开的学习毛主席著作、宣传毛泽东思想的群众性运动，妄图扑灭香港中国同胞燃起的毛泽东思想的真理的火焰。他们勾结美蒋反动势力，开动一切宣传机器，动员香港所有反动报纸，对我国无产阶级文化大革命进行恶毒的诋毁和诬蔑。他们不准我国影片《东方红》和反映我国三次核试验的影片在香港放映。他们限制香港爱国同胞举行革命文艺演出，无理审查演出节目，粗暴禁演反映王杰英雄事迹和澳门中国同胞同澳门葡萄牙当局斗争胜利的节目。他们对爱国同胞携带《毛主席语录》视为“大逆不道”，野蛮地派警察、暗探搜身检查，一经查出，就拘捕入狱，施加毒打。香港英国当局甚至对佩戴毛主席像章和语录牌的小学生和高唱《大海航行靠舵手》的年幼儿童也进行迫害。这一切说明，英帝国主义者就象老鼠害怕阳光那样害怕毛泽东思想。他们所作所为，简直是愚蠢到极点，野蛮到极点。　
    我们要庄严地宣告：香港中国同胞学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想的种种活动，是天经地义的，是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利。香港英国当局决没有任何理由进行干涉。光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想必将普照全世界，任何人妄想遏制毛泽东思想的不可抗拒的影响，那就一定要碰得头破血流。
    在十多天来的反对香港英国当局的抗暴斗争中，我香港爱国工人、青年学生、新闻记者和其他居民，正是在斗争中进一步活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，所以才能敢于斗争，善于斗争，面对着全副武装的英帝国主义军警强盗，无所畏惧。他们高呼“毛主席万岁！”朗诵毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲，运用大字报这个新式武器，发挥了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的巨大无比的威力。香港爱国同胞本来有着一百多年的反帝斗争的光荣传统。著名的一九二五年香港大罢工写下了世界革命工人斗争史上的光辉的一页。今天，用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国工人和居民，更是吓不倒、压不垮的。
    同志们，战友们！
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”老奸巨猾的英帝国主义目前正在硬着头皮，玩弄各种阴谋诡计，来对付我香港爱国同胞的正义斗争。香港英国当局现在不但没有公开道歉，没有立即接受我国政府在声明中提出的一切严正要求，反而一面调动军警，勾结美蒋特务，准备进行更大规模的迫害和镇压，一面玩弄种种软硬兼施、恫吓欺骗、分化利诱的反革命两面手法，妄图把我香港爱国同胞正义斗争的烈火扑灭下去。他们还异想天开地认为，中国正在忙于无产阶级文化大革命，无暇顾及香港中国同胞的正义斗争。英国政府和香港英国当局，完全打错了算盘，找错了对象。经历了一年来无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的中国人民，是比过去任何时候都更加坚强了。我们要正告愚蠢透顶的英国政府和香港英国当局，你们必须放聪明些。你们既然对香港中国同胞犯下了严重罪行，你们就必须老老实实地向全体香港中国居民承担罪责，作出交代；否则你们就必须承担一切严重的后果。
    最后，让我们高呼：
    强烈抗议香港英国当局的法西斯暴行！
    向英勇斗争的香港爱国同胞致敬！
    坚决支持我香港爱国同胞的正义斗争！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒英帝国主义！
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
