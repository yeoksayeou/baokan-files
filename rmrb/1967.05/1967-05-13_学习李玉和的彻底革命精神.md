Learning from Li Yuhe's Thorough Revolutionary Spirit

After watching the revolutionary Peking opera "The Red Lantern," I could not suppress my inner excitement. One heroic figure after another occupied my entire mind. I kept thinking: Why could an ordinary railway worker like Li Yuhe remain steadfast in the face of a grand banquet? Why could he remain unyielding under the enemy's brutal torture? Why could he remain calm and composed in the face of the enemy's urgent search for the code? Why could he face the gallows without flinching? This opera, through the character of Li Yuhe, vividly answers these questions. It is because in Li Yuhe's heart, there is a red lantern shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. In his heart, there is only the Party, only the revolution, only the public interest. "Only the selfless can be fearless." An ordinary worker, an ordinary commune member, an ordinary soldier, as long as they are wholeheartedly devoted to the Party, to the revolution, to the people, they will generate boundless wisdom and courage, and be able to achieve great deeds that shake the heavens and earth.

"The Red Lantern" is a model play that praises the heroic figures of the working class, a model that implements Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, and a model of literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. We, the working class, love such plays and need such plays.

Before 1964, what was the literary world like? At that time, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, made the entire literary world chaotic. Especially during the three years of difficulty, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in order to prepare public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, mobilized all propaganda tools to launch an attack on the proletariat. At that time, the stage was filled with performances of emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, with poisonous weeds and ghosts and snakes all coming out. At this time, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party himself took off his shirt and threw out the big poisonous weed "Cultivation" again, vigorously advocating "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," cultivating personal interests for oneself, struggling for oneself, and singing in opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and socialism. These devilish tricks are all for serving the bourgeoisie and for the restoration of capitalism.

Proletarian literature is new because of the public interest, while "feudal," "bourgeois," and "revisionist" literature is old because of self-interest. Whether it is for the public or for the self is a fundamental sign that distinguishes proletarian literature from exploitative class literature.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to break down self-interest and establish public interest. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we should learn from Li Yuhe's spirit of wholeheartedly devoting to the public and everything for the public. Only with the public interest first, can we dare to be first, have the fearless revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his throne," dare to make a revolution, and dare to rebel against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. If self-interest prevails, it is inevitable to make mistakes. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have a deep understanding. In the early stages of the movement, I did not dare to rebel against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Self-interest was like a heavy burden on my shoulders. Later, after repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's works, such as the "Three Constantly Read Articles," I made up my mind to break down self-interest and firmly stand with the revolutionary comrades to fight.

I watched the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern." The heroic image of Li Yuhe and his fearless revolutionary spirit of rebellion have been a vivid education for me. We should learn from Li Yuhe's spirit of wholeheartedly devoting to the revolution and to the people, use the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly break down self-interest, and firmly establish public interest. Only in this way can we always be revolutionaries.

    学习李玉和的彻底革命精神
    贵州省贵阳第一棉纺织厂工人  贵州省革命委员会常委  陈北婵
    看了革命京剧《红灯记》，抑制不住内心的激动，一个一个光辉的英雄形象占据了我的整个心灵。我反复地想：象李玉和这样一个普普通通的铁路工人，为什么能够在豪厅盛宴面前不动摇？为什么能够在敌人的严刑酷打之下不屈服？为什么能够在敌人搜索密码万分紧急的情况下随机应变、神态自若？为什么能够在走向刑场时面不改色心不跳？这出戏通过李玉和这个英雄形象生动地回答了这些问题，就是因为在李玉和的心里有一盏闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的红灯。在他的心里，只有党，只有革命，只有一个公字。“无私才能无畏”。一个普通的工人、普通的社员、普通的战士，只要一心向党，一心为革命，一心为人民，就会产生无穷的智慧和勇敢，就能做出惊天动地的丰功伟绩。
    《红灯记》是歌颂工人阶级英雄人物的样板，是贯彻毛主席革命文艺路线的样板，是文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的样板。我们工人阶级就喜欢这样的戏，就需要这样的戏。
    一九六四年以前，文艺界是啥样啊！那时，周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，把整个文艺界搞得乌烟瘴气。特别是在三年困难时期，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，为复辟资本主义制造舆论准备，开动一切宣传工具，发起向无产阶级的进攻。当时的舞台上大演帝王将相、才子佳人，毒草丛生，牛鬼蛇神一起都跑了出来。这时，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派自己也赤膊上阵，再次抛出《修养》这棵大毒草，极力鼓吹“吃小亏占大便宜”，为我修养，为我奋斗的资产阶级个人主义，与毛泽东思想大唱反调，与社会主义大唱反调。这些鬼玩艺，统统是为资产阶级服务的，为资本主义复辟服务的。
    无产阶级文艺所以新，就新在一个公字上，“封”、“资”、“修”的文艺所以旧，就旧在一个私字上。为公还是为私，是区别无产阶级文艺与剥削阶级文艺的一个根本标志。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场破私立公的大革命。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要学习李玉和那种一心为公、一切为公的崇高革命精神。只有公字当头，才能做到敢字当头，才能有“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏的革命精神，才敢革命，敢造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。如果让私字占了上风，就非犯错误不可。我在这次无产阶级文化大革命中有深刻的体会，在运动初期我就不敢起来造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。私字就象一个沉重的包袱压在自己肩上。后来我反复学习了毛主席著作“老三篇”等，才狠下决心，破除私字，坚决与革命派的同志们站在一起战斗。
    我看了京剧革命现代戏《红灯记》，李玉和的英雄形象，他那种大无畏的革命造反精神，对我是一次生动的教育。我们应该学习李玉和那种一心为革命，一心为人民的彻底革命精神，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，狠破私字，大立公字。只有这样，我们才能永远做一个革命派。
