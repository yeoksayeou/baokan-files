The Soviet revisionists have been distorting history and defaming the great image of Lenin. The Soviet people are extremely indignant at this shameless act.

According to statistics, from 1957 to 1964, the Soviet Union published approximately nine hundred books and pamphlets on the theme of Lenin. In recent years, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Lenin's birth and the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, from some of Lenin's contemporaries to the "hoodlums" writers cultivated after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, all have been writing about Lenin extensively. Novels that distort Lenin have flooded large and small literary publications. Soviet revisionist writers, in accordance with the needs of the revisionist line, arbitrarily tamper with history. Some even shamelessly portray Lenin as a person who does not distinguish between friends and enemies, a "humane sentimentalist," and others depict Lenin as a "self-admiring politician" in the style of the bourgeoisie.

In Soviet films, there are also many scenes that defame Lenin. The Soviet film scriptwriter Gabrilovich wrote in the Soviet magazine "Film Art" that one can rely on conjecture and fabrication to create stories about historical figures, even the greatest ones. When he wrote the film scripts "The Story of Lenin" and "Lenin in Poland," he used this method. For example, in the latter film, some scenes are made up out of thin air: Lenin in a Catholic church; Lenin saying he should protect love; Lenin regretting that he has no children...

This shameless act has aroused great anger among the Soviet people. Many Soviet people have written to newspapers to protest. They condemn: "The fact of speculating on the theme of Lenin is 'unbearable'; to remain silent about these works that are wrong in both thought and fact, distorting the image of Lenin, is 'unforgivable'!" A viewer wrote to the Literary Gazette: "Lenin is so precious and dear to Soviet audiences that any story about him and every detail of his life will immediately evoke a great response from people. The wide popularity of films about Lenin shows that people are confident in the authenticity of the main plot, that they have a great desire for this authenticity, and that they demand a full understanding of Lenin's true life and activities." He expressed his dissatisfaction with films like "Lenin in Poland" that arbitrarily fabricate details of Lenin's life, angrily saying: "This is speculating on the sacred feelings of the broad masses of viewers towards Lenin."

    苏修篡改历史丑化伟大列宁形象
    苏联人民对这种无耻行径表示极大愤慨
    据统计，从一九五七年到一九六四年，苏联出版了约九百种写列宁题材的书和小册子。近年来，为了迎接列宁诞生一百周年和十月革命五十周年，从列宁的某些同代人，到苏共二十大以后培养出来的阿飞作家，都大写列宁。歪曲列宁的小说，充斥于大小文学刊物。苏修文人，适应修正主义路线的需要，任意篡改历史。有人竟无耻地把列宁写成敌我不分的有“人性”的人，“感伤的人道主义者”，有人把列宁描绘成资产阶级式的“自我欣赏的政客”。
    在苏联电影中，也出现不少丑化列宁的情节。苏联电影剧作家加布里洛维奇在苏联《电影艺术》杂志上写道，可以依靠臆测和虚构来创造关于历史人物，甚至是最伟大的人物。他在写关于列宁的电影剧本《列宁的故事》、《列宁在波兰》时，就是采用这种手法。例如在后一部影片中的一些情节是凭空想出来的：列宁在天主教堂中；列宁说他应该保护爱情；列宁惋惜他没有孩子……。
    这种无耻行径，引起了苏联人民的极大愤怒，许多苏联人向报刊写信抗议。他们谴责说：这种“在列宁题材上进行投机的事实”，是“不可容忍的”；对这些“在思想和事实方面都包含着错误的、歪曲列宁形象的作品闭口不言”，是“不能饶恕的”！一位观众给《文学报》的信中说：列宁“对于苏联观众是如此宝贵和亲切，以致任何关于他的故事以及他生活中的每一个小节都会立刻引起人们的巨大反应。关于列宁的电影的广受欢迎，正说明人们确信影片的主要情节的真实性，说明他们对这种真实性抱着巨大的愿望，并且要求最充分地了解列宁的真实生活和活动。”他对《列宁在波兰》等影片随意伪造列宁生活情节表示不满，气愤地说：“这是拿广大观众对列宁的神圣感情进行投机”。
