One year ago, the notice issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, pointed out the direction for our broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It told us to direct the spearhead of our struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, because they are the Khrushchovs sleeping in our beds. "Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship."

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road want to usurp power from the proletariat. We, the working class, must consolidate the proletarian dictatorship to ensure that the iron mountains and rivers of socialism will never change color.

Without proletarian dictatorship, we, the working class, would have nothing.

Before liberation, we workers had no rights. Under the oppression and exploitation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, we workers had no rights to live or speak. The class enemies practiced dictatorship over us workers. Where was there any equality?

We finally welcomed liberation and established the proletarian dictatorship. We workers stood up and became masters. However, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road used their positions to attempt a capitalist restoration. During the period of temporary economic difficulties in our country, they fiercely attacked the Three Red Banners, advocating the "Four Freedoms" and "Three Selfs and One Package," undermining the foundations of socialism. In the factories, they implemented capitalist management systems and operational methods, disrupting the development of the socialist economy.

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road do not allow us, the proletariat, to practice dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, but instead want the bourgeoisie to ride on our heads again, practicing dictatorship over the proletariat. We, the working class, will never allow this. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is to expose, overthrow, and smash the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, ensuring they will never rise again.

We workers, following Chairman Mao's teachings, stood up and rebelled against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in our factory.

The number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his clique hate and fear the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to death. They openly defied Chairman Mao's instructions, hastily sending out work teams everywhere, attempting to extinguish the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They confused right and wrong, black and white, slandering the revolutionary masses who rose up to rebel as "rightists emerging." At that time, when I gave suggestions to the Party branch, I was labeled as "anti-Party." When I gave suggestions to the work team, I was accused of "insulting the work team" and being a "counter-revolutionary in action." For a while, dark clouds swirled, and the cultural revolution in our factory was almost suppressed.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, cares for and supports us, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, the most. He called on us to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We achieved victory in seizing power and are determined to hold power well and use it well, truly putting the power in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. For the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we, the working class, must seize their power, remove their positions, and practice dictatorship over them. We must not talk about any equality with them.

    对敌人就是要专政
    北京市革命委员会委员

    一年以前，毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》，给我们广大工农兵、革命干部和革命的知识分子，指明了无产阶级文化大革命的方向，要我们把斗争的矛头集中指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，因为他们就是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫，“一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄想从我们无产阶级手里篡夺政权，我们工人阶级就一定要巩固无产阶级专政，保证社会主义铁打的江山永不变色。
    没有无产阶级专政，就没有我们工人阶级的一切。
    解放前，我们工人根本没有权。在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的压迫和剥削下，我们工人连生活和说话的权利都没有。阶级敌人对我们工人就是实行专政，那里有什么平等？
    好容易盼来了解放，建立了无产阶级专政，我们工人翻身当了主人。可是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派却利用他们的职权，搞资本主义复辟。他们在我国经济暂时困难时期，大肆攻击三面红旗，鼓吹“四大自由”、“三自一包”，挖社会主义的墙脚。他们在工厂里搞资本主义的管理体制和经营方法，破坏社会主义经济的发展。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派不让我们无产阶级对资产阶级实行专政，而要让他们资产阶级重新骑在我们工人头上，对无产阶级实行专政。我们工人阶级绝对不答应。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，让他们永世不得翻身。
    我们工人遵照毛主席的教导，站出来，造了厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙，对无产阶级文化大革命恨得要死，怕得要命。他们公开对抗毛主席的指示，匆匆忙忙到处派出工作组，企图扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火。他们颠倒是非，混淆黑白，诬蔑革命群众起来造反是“右派出笼”。我当时给党支部提意见，就说我是“反党”。我给工作组提意见，就说是“侮辱工作组”，是“现行反革命”。一时黑云乱翻，我们厂的文化革命差点被压下去了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，最最关心、最最支持我们无产阶级革命派。他老人家号召我们起来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权。我们取得了夺权的胜利，并且决心掌好权，用好权，把印把子真正掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们工人阶级就是要夺他们的权，罢他们的官，专他们的政，对他们绝对不能讲什么平等。
