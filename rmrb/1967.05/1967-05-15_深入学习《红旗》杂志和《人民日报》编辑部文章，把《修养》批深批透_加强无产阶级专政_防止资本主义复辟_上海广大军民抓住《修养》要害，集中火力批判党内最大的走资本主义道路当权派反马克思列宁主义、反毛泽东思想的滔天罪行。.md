Deeply study the articles from the editorial departments of "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily," thoroughly criticize "On Cultivation"
Strengthen proletarian dictatorship to prevent capitalist restoration
Shanghai's broad masses of military and civilians focus on the crux of "On Cultivation," concentrating firepower to criticize the heinous crimes of the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 14th - The publication of the important article "The Crux of 'On Cultivation' is Betraying Proletarian Dictatorship" by the editorial departments of "Red Flag" magazine and "People's Daily" has pushed the struggle of Shanghai's revolutionary masses of the proletariat to criticize the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road to a new high. In recent days, revolutionary masses of the proletariat from various factories, offices, and schools, along with the broad ranks of soldiers and officers from the Shanghai-based army, navy, and air force, have continued to hold study sessions and discussions, using this article as a powerful ideological weapon to concentrate firepower in criticizing the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road for his heinous crimes of completely betraying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

After carefully studying this important article, Shanghai's broad masses of workers and peasants pointed out: Proletarian dictatorship is the lifeline of our revolutionary people. Whoever opposes proletarian dictatorship, we will resolutely overthrow them. The top party power-holder taking the capitalist road hates proletarian dictatorship so much, fearing that we proletarians will seize power, wanting the three major enemies to forever oppress and exploit us laborers. We will never allow it! We will never allow it!

Shanghai's active learner and propagandist of Chairman Mao's works, the famous national advanced worker, and weaver from Shanghai No. 1 Textile Mill, Yang Fuzhen, said, "Chairman Mao has led the nation in decades of arduous struggle to overthrow the three major mountains oppressing the Chinese people, to implement proletarian dictatorship, and to let the laborers rule. We workers deeply understand that with proletarian dictatorship, we have everything; without proletarian dictatorship, the bourgeoisie will impose their dictatorship on us, and we will suffer twice. Before the proletarian revolution's victory, the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road fiercely opposed our proletariat seizing power; after the proletarian revolution's victory, he fiercely opposed proletarian dictatorship. This book 'On Cultivation' is a trap set by him to make us forget the power won by countless revolutionary martyrs, to make us unknowingly lose proletarian power, to make our country unknowingly undergo 'peaceful evolution' and become a revisionist country. We must be a thousand times more vigilant to prevent this small clique of top party power-holders taking the capitalist road from usurping the party and the country. To do this, we must firmly remember Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must, in the struggle, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, thoroughly criticize and expose the poison of this book 'On Cultivation,' and turn our factories, villages, and the entire country into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought."

A responsible person from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee emphasized: The theory of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship is the essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Whether to persist in revolution or oppose it, whether to persist in proletarian dictatorship or oppose it, has always been the focal point of the struggle between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and all opportunism and revisionism. The current great proletarian cultural revolution, in essence, is a struggle to further consolidate proletarian dictatorship. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, during the great storm of the "January Revolution," Shanghai's revolutionary masses of the proletariat established a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ for the proletariat - the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. This power organ is not the kind of "centralized and democratic state organ" advocated by the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road, but as Chairman Mao said, it is an organ that "implements a democratic system among the people, while the working class, together with all citizens with rights, primarily the peasants, exercises dictatorship over the reactionary classes, reactionaries, and elements resisting socialist transformation and socialist construction." The Revolutionary Committee, within our people, fully implements great democracy under proletarian dictatorship, implementing great debates, big-character posters, and great discussions. However, we show no mercy to class enemies, giving them no democracy, only allowing them to behave properly and not allowing them to cause trouble. Only in this way can we ensure the victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution and ensure that the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ fully exercises its authority. We continuously strengthen the authority of the Revolutionary Committee and continuously strengthen proletarian dictatorship, which is the most powerful blow to the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road. In the face of the iron wall of proletarian dictatorship, all those opposing proletarian dictatorship will surely be defeated!

A responsible person from the Red Guards of Huadong Normal University said: During the great proletarian cultural revolution, the small clique of top party power-holders taking the capitalist road threw out a bourgeois reactionary line, imposing bourgeois dictatorship on revolutionary masses, which is not accidental because they have always opposed proletarian dictatorship. They also spread the anarchist trend of "excluding everything and overthrowing everything," which is not accidental because they use anarchism to sabotage proletarian dictatorship. This small clique of bad elements yearns for the anarchist trend to erode the body of our revolutionary masses of the proletariat, to sabotage proletarian revolutionary discipline, and to sabotage proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people." Anarchism does not want the revolutionary authority of the proletariat and does not want the organizational discipline of proletarian revolution, resulting in weakening and sabotaging proletarian dictatorship. Without eliminating the poison of anarchism, we cannot "liberate a large area and strike a small clique" in the cadre issue. Without eliminating anarchist thoughts, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat will fall into long-term, unprincipled "internal wars." This will precisely fall into the trap of the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road, only causing pain to friends and joy to enemies. We revolutionary masses of the proletariat must use the great Mao Zedong Thought to unify the thoughts of our ranks. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of anarchism and establish the public spirit.

After studying the important article "The Crux of 'On Cultivation' is Betraying Proletarian Dictatorship," the soldiers and officers of the PLA's navy, army, and air force stationed in Shanghai further ignited their resolve to firmly hold the gun, to be the backbone of the great proletarian cultural revolution, and to defend the great proletarian dictatorship with their blood and lives. At a symposium convened by the Party Committee of the East China Sea Fleet of the PLA Navy, the fleet's responsible comrades and responsible cadres from some units stationed in Shanghai pointed out: Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Every Communist must understand this truth: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'" Chairman Mao also said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." However, in his representative work "On Cultivation," the top party power-holder taking the capitalist road talks abstractly about class struggle, avoiding discussing revolutionary war and avoiding discussing seizing political power through armed struggle. This is a complete betrayal of Chairman Mao's famous statement "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," which is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and a complete betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We, the PLA, are the pillars of proletarian dictatorship. We are the most loyal to the people and the most loyal to proletarian dictatorship. In the past, we followed Chairman Mao through countless battles, fighting south and north, using the gun to win the world of proletarian dictatorship, and today we must firmly hold the gun to defend the mountains and rivers of proletarian dictatorship. At this crucial moment when the great proletarian cultural revolution enters the decisive battle between the two classes and two lines, we respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely carry out the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, to smash the plot of the small clique of top party power-holders taking the capitalist road to restore capitalism in China, and to defend proletarian dictatorship. We must stand firmly with the broad leftist masses, humbly learn from the masses, humbly listen to the masses' opinions, and excellently complete the glorious tasks given to us by Chairman Mao, to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, ensuring that the iron mountains and rivers of the proletariat will never change color for ten thousand generations.

    深入学习《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部文章，把《修养》批深批透
    加强无产阶级专政　防止资本主义复辟
    上海广大军民抓住《修养》要害，集中火力批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    新华社上海十四日电　《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部的重要文章《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》的发表，把上海无产阶级革命派批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争推向了一个新的高潮。连日来，各工厂、机关、学校的无产阶级革命派和驻上海陆海空三军广大指战员，继续举行学习和座谈，以这篇文章作为强大的思想武器，集中火力批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派彻底背叛马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    上海广大工农群众认真学习了这篇重要文章以后指出：无产阶级专政是我们革命人民的命根子。谁反对无产阶级专政，我们就坚决打倒谁。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派如此仇恨无产阶级专政，就是害怕我们无产阶级掌权，就是要让三大敌人永远骑在我们劳动人民头上剥削我们，压迫我们。我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！
    上海活学活用毛主席著作积极分子、著名的全国先进生产者、国棉一厂织布挡车工杨富珍说，毛主席领导全国人民艰苦奋斗几十年，就是为了推翻压在中国人民头上的三座大山，为了实行无产阶级专政，让劳动人民坐天下。我们工人阶级深深懂得，有无产阶级专政，才有我们的一切；没有无产阶级专政，资产阶级就要对我们实行专政，我们就要吃二遍苦。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在无产阶级革命胜利以前，就疯狂反对我们无产阶级夺取政权；在无产阶级革命胜利后，他又疯狂反对无产阶级专政。《修养》这本书，就是要我们去上他的恶毒的圈套，要我们忘记无数革命先烈英勇牺牲换来的政权，要我们不知不觉地丢掉无产阶级政权，使我们国家不知不觉地“和平演变”，变成修正主义国家。我们要千百倍地提高警惕，防止党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡国。要做到这一点，我们就要牢牢记住林彪副主席的指示，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。我们要在斗争中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把《修养》这本书彻底批臭，肃清它的流毒，把我们的工厂、农村和整个国家都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    上海市革命委员会的一位负责人强调指出：无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的精髓。坚持革命还是反对革命，坚持无产阶级专政还是反对无产阶级专政，历来是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同一切机会主义、修正主义斗争的焦点。当前这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，实际上就是一场进一步巩固无产阶级专政的斗争。上海市的无产阶级革命派，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中，建立了革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构——上海市革命委员会。这个权力机构绝不是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的那种仅仅“又有集中又有民主的国家机关”，而是如毛主席所说的“在人民内部实行民主制度，而由工人阶级团结全体有公民权的人民，首先是农民，向着反动阶级、反动派和反抗社会主义改造和社会主义建设的分子实行专政”的机构。革命委员会在我们人民内部，充分实行无产阶级专政下的大民主，实行大鸣，大放，大字报，大辩论。但是，对阶级敌人决不施“仁政”，一点民主也不给，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。这样，才能够保证无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行，才能够保证革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构充分发挥权威作用。我们不断加强革命委员会的权威作用，不断加强无产阶级专政，就是对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的最有力打击。在无产阶级专政的铜墙铁壁面前，一切反对无产阶级专政的人必将碰得头破血流！
    华东师范大学红卫兵新师大师负责人说：在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派抛出一条资产阶级反动路线，对革命群众实行资产阶级专政，这决不是偶然的，因为他们一贯反对无产阶级专政。他们还极力散布“排斥一切，打倒一切”的无政府主义思潮，这也决不是偶然的，因为他们同时又利用无政府主义来破坏无产阶级专政。这一小撮坏家伙，渴望无政府主义思潮侵蚀我们无产阶级革命派的肌体，破坏无产阶级的革命纪律，破坏无产阶级专政。毛主席教导我们：“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”无政府主义一不要无产阶级的革命权威，二不要无产阶级革命的组织纪律性，其结果是削弱和破坏了无产阶级专政。不肃清无政府主义的流毒，我们就不能在干部问题上“解放一大片，打击一小撮”。不肃清无政府主义思想，无产阶级革命派内部就会陷入长时期的无原则的“内战”。这样就恰恰是中了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的奸计，只能使亲者痛，仇者快。我们无产阶级革命派一定要用伟大的毛泽东思想来统一自己队伍的思想。我们一定要大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底肃清无政府主义的流毒。
    人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军指战员学习《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇重要文章后，进一步激发了他们紧握枪杆子，誓做无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱，誓用鲜血和生命保卫伟大的无产阶级专政的坚强决心。在人民解放军海军东海舰队党委召集的一次座谈会上，舰队的负责人和驻上海部分部队的负责干部指出：我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“每个共产党员都应懂得这个真理：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”毛主席又说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”而党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在他的代表作《修养》中，空谈一些抽象的阶级斗争的词句，闭口不谈革命战争，闭口不谈武装夺取政权，这是对毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”这个著名论断的彻底背叛，也就是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻底背叛，是对无产阶级革命事业的彻底背叛。我们人民解放军是无产阶级专政的柱石。我们最忠于人民，最忠于无产阶级专政。过去，我们跟随毛主席辗转沙场，南征北战，用枪杆子打出了无产阶级专政的天下，今天我们就要紧握枪杆子保卫无产阶级专政的江山。在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决执行支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项光荣任务，就是为了粉碎党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，保卫无产阶级专政。我们一定要和左派广大群众紧紧站在一起，虚心地向群众学习，虚心地听群众意见，出色地完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，保证无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色。
