While Launching a Diplomatic Offensive, Military Deployments Are Also Being Rushed
The U.S. and Britain Plot for the United Nations to Intervene in the Middle East Situation
American News Agency Reveals: If the United Nations Fails to Intervene, the U.S. and Britain Will Take Military Action

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, the U.S. and British imperialists are intensifying frequent diplomatic activities, plotting to have the United Nations intervene in the Middle East situation, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle.

The head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, personally took the initiative to go to Ottawa on the 25th to discuss the Middle East situation with Canadian Prime Minister Pearson. According to Agence France-Presse, the United States and Canada have reached "complete agreement" on the issue of United Nations intervention in the Middle East. The British *Times* revealed that Johnson decided to meet with Pearson due to the "urgent need to reestablish an effective United Nations force in the region once ground hostilities begin."

The United Press International revealed that during Johnson's meeting with Pearson and the talks between British Foreign Secretary Thomson and U.S. officials in Washington, it was agreed to launch a "diplomatic offensive" to sabotage the UAR's decision to blockade the Gulf of Aqaba and to pressure Arab countries. This U.S. news agency also revealed that Thomson had reached an agreement with the United States to "let the United Nations try to resolve the Middle East conflict," and if "this effort fails," they will "resort to force."

U.S. Secretary of State Rusk is one of the masterminds behind the plot to have the United Nations intervene in the Middle East situation. On the 26th, he belligerently declared that "the United Nations must play a major role in the Middle East." Rusk even openly instigated Israel to launch new aggression against Arab countries, stating in a threatening tone that he "does not believe the United States and the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility of preventing any possible Israeli attack on Egypt." The *International Herald Tribune* revealed that the United States has "quietly" assured the Israelis that the United States will fulfill its "obligations" to support Israel.

While the U.S. and British imperialists are engaged in political conspiracies, they are also secretly plotting military deployments in the Mediterranean. According to the British *Daily Mail*, the U.S. and Britain have formulated plans to launch naked aggression against Arab countries.

    一面发动外交攻势　一面加紧军事部署
    美英策划由联合国插手干预中东局势
    美国通讯社透露，如联合国干预不成，美英将采取武力行动
    据新华社二十七日讯  美、英帝国主义正在加紧进行频繁的外交活动，阴谋策划由联合国插手干预中东局势，企图扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝斗争的怒火。
    美帝国主义的头子约翰逊亲自出马，在二十五日去渥太华同加拿大总理皮尔逊就中东局势进行了会谈。据法新社报道，美国和加拿大已经就联合国干预中东局势问题取得了“完全一致”的意见。英国《泰晤士报》透露，约翰逊决定同皮尔逊会谈，是由于“迫切需要在一旦地面敌对行动开始时，就重新建立一支有效地进驻那个地区的联合国部队”。
    美国合众国际社透露，在约翰逊同皮尔逊的会谈中以及英国国务大臣汤姆森同美国官员在华盛顿的会谈中，已商定发动“外交攻势”，破坏阿联封锁亚喀巴湾的决定，对阿拉伯国家施加压力。这家美国通讯社还透露，汤姆森已经同美国达成协议，“让联合国来尝试解决中东的冲突”，如果“这一努力失败”，将“采取武力”。
    美国国务卿腊斯克是阴谋策划联合国插手干预中东局势的主谋人之一，他在二十六日气势汹汹地叫嚣说“联合国在中东要起主要作用”。腊斯克甚至公然进一步怂恿以色列对阿拉伯国家发动新的侵略，他用恐吓的口气声称，他“并不认为美国和苏联应当承担遏止以色列可能向埃及发动任何进攻的责任”。美国《国际先驱论坛报》透露，美国已经“悄悄地”向以色列人“保证”，美国将履行它支持以色列的“义务”。
    美、英帝国主义者进行政治阴谋活动的同时，正密谋在地中海加紧军事部署。据英国《每日邮报》透露，美英已经制定了准备对阿拉伯国家进行赤裸裸的侵略的计划。
