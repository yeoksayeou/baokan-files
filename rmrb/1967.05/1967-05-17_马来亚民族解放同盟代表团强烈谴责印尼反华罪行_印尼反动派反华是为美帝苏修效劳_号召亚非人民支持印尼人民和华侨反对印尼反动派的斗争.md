The Malayan National Liberation League delegation in China issued a statement on May 11, representing the revolutionary people of Malaya (including Singapore) to strongly condemn the heinous crimes of anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese discrimination by the fascist regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia.

The statement lists the various atrocities of the Indonesian fascist regime's anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese discrimination and points out that the evil deeds of the Indonesian fascist regime's frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese discrimination are aimed at serving their bosses in Washington, Moscow, and London to exchange dollars, rubles, and pounds as well as military equipment to suppress the Indonesian people's struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the Suharto-Nasution fascist group; to cater to the needs of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain to join forces to encircle the People's Republic of China—the base of world revolution.

The statement says that while the Indonesian fascist regime is collaborating with imperialism and revisionism to launch an anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-world people's revolutionary movement, it is also colluding with Japanese militarism and other imperialist puppets in Southeast Asia to sabotage the national liberation struggle in this region and turn Southeast Asian countries into a bridgehead for invading China. This is even more evident in their plans to strengthen counter-revolutionary ties and establish various counter-revolutionary alliances (for example, establishing close ties with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan and the most shameful American imperialist puppet in Saigon, and actively participating in the Southeast Asia Conference aimed at promoting regional cooperation—Malayan puppets Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew were particularly active in this conference).

The statement warmly praises the revolutionary people of Indonesia, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, for their struggle against the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime. The statement points out that this struggle is an indispensable part of the world-wide revolutionary struggle against imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, and against modern revisionism centered in Moscow.

The statement says that the patriots of Malaya were the first to suffer persecution from the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime. The revolutionary people of Malaya pledge to fully support the Indonesian Chinese in their struggle against the fascist persecution of the Suharto-Nasution regime, to safeguard their lives, property, and other legitimate rights that have been most savagely destroyed. The statement says, "We call on the people of Asia and Africa to give brotherly support to this just struggle of the Chinese, and to the Indonesian people's national liberation struggle to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime—the running dogs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism—to free themselves from all oppression and persecution."

    新华社讯　马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团十一日发表声明，代表马来亚（包括新加坡）的革命人民强烈谴责印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权疯狂反华、排华的滔天罪行。
    声明列举苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权反华排华的种种暴行后指出，印尼法西斯政权疯狂反华排华的罪恶勾当，目的是为了替他们的华盛顿、莫斯科和伦敦的老板效劳，来换取美元、卢布和英镑以及军事装备，用以镇压印尼人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯集团的斗争；是为了迎合美、苏、英勾结起来包围中华人民共和国——世界革命的根据地——的需要。
    声明说，印尼法西斯政权在配合帝国主义和修正主义掀起反共、反华、反对世界人民革命运动的同时，又勾结日本军国主义和东南亚其他帝国主义的傀儡，破坏这个地区的民族解放斗争，把东南亚国家变成侵略中国的桥头堡。这一点在他们的加强反革命联系，建立形形色色的反革命联盟（例如同在台湾的卖国贼蒋介石和西贡的最可耻的美帝国主义傀儡建立密切联系，参加旨在促进区域性合作的东南亚会议——马来亚拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡在这次会议上特别积极）的计划里更加明显。
    声明中热烈赞扬了有着光荣的反帝斗争传统的印度尼西亚革命人民反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权的斗争。声明指出，这场斗争是世界规模的反对以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派，反对以莫斯科为中心的现代修正主义的革命斗争的不可分割的一部分。
    声明说，马来亚爱国者是首先遭到苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权迫害的。马来亚革命人民保证完全支持印度尼西亚华侨反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权的法西斯迫害，为他们的生命财产的安全以及其他受到最野蛮破坏的合法权利而进行的斗争。声明说，我们号召亚非人民给予华侨的这一正义斗争，以及印度尼西亚人民推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权——美帝和苏修的走狗、使自己摆脱一切压迫和迫害的民族解放斗争，以兄弟般的支持。
