The proletarian revolutionaries at the Institute of Geochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have firmly grasped the direction of the struggle in the campaign to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party. They have correctly resolved the differences among the revolutionary factions, consolidated the revolutionary great alliance, and promoted the establishment of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination temporary power organ, creating the conditions to thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and annihilate the top capitalist-roader within the Party.

In the initial stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionaries at this institute united as one to fight against the enemy, resolutely struggling against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Guizhou Provincial Committee, and the Guiyang Municipal Committee. However, as the movement developed, due to the existence of some specific differences, two factions gradually formed. Later, through internal rectification and learning from the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill, both sides basically reached a consensus, uniting on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving differences. However, many comrades had not yet fully united in their thoughts, and thus, differences re-emerged regarding the selection of personnel for the "three-in-one" combination leadership.

After the publication of the article "Patriotism or Treason?", every proletarian revolutionary at this institute strongly felt that the great battle to launch a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader within the Party had begun. This is the biggest political issue at present and the direction of the struggle. At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, it is necessary to immediately stop the "internal war" and unite to fight the enemy.

To further resolve the differences and truly unite in thought, the proletarian revolutionaries at this institute, focusing on the problems within the revolutionary factions, studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and relevant parts of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They examined their past mistakes in dealing with cadres and mass movements, and resolved to act according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Both sides took the initiative to hold symposiums to exchange views and conduct self-criticism. Everyone realized that the proletarian revolutionaries must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, be ruthless to the enemy and lenient to ourselves; for the shortcomings and errors of the revolutionary factions, they must help each other warmly and overcome them through rectification and normal debates; for specific matters, they must conduct concrete analyses and not easily label revolutionary comrades with big hats; most importantly, they must actively learn and apply the "Three Articles" in the struggle, constantly break down private interests and establish public interests, and overcome thoughts of seeking fame, sectarianism, individualism, and anarchism. Through these activities, the proletarian revolutionaries eliminated estrangement, increased unity, and consolidated the great alliance.

The publication of the article "Patriotism or Treason?" made many cadres clearly see the direction of the struggle and actively join the mass movement to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, angrily denouncing the harm caused by "Cultivation of the Self." The revolutionary actions of the cadres were welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. Some comrades said: In the past, our understanding of cadres was somewhat one-sided, affecting the smooth progress of the "three-in-one" combination. Through the criticism of "Cultivation of the Self," we realized that the originally good but erring leaders were both executors of the bourgeois reactionary line and victims. Now, they dare to stand up and expose and criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, showing that they are revolutionary. Some comrades said: The top capitalist-roader within the Party denigrated our cadres as utterly worthless, precisely to sow discord between cadres and the masses, attempting to achieve the goal of "striking down a large group and protecting a handful." We must not be deceived and must unite with revolutionary cadres.

The proletarian revolutionaries at the Institute of Geochemistry further followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "One must be good at identifying cadres. One must not only look at a cadre's single act or moment but must look at the cadre's entire history and entire work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." They conducted a class analysis of the cadres and, for revolutionary cadres who made mistakes in the movement, firmly implemented the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," adopting an attitude of "one look, two helps." For example, regarding the former Party Committee Secretary of the institute, they saw both his execution of the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement and his later struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the provincial committee. Therefore, they decided to help him further revolutionize. The revolutionary faction had multiple talks with him, held small meetings to help him, and gave him the opportunity to make self-exposure and criticism to the revolutionary masses, showing his determination to correct errors and follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. However, could he be an object of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination? There were still differences at that time. In the common struggle to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, the former Party Committee Secretary actively stood up, angrily denouncing the harm caused by "Cultivation of the Self" to himself, with a sincere attitude and relatively deep understanding. His revolutionary actions were welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses, gaining the trust of the vast majority of comrades in the institute, and finally being elected as an object of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

    地球化学研究所革命派内部相互帮助消除分歧
    掌握斗争大方向团结对敌
    在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，巩固了革命的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”
    本报讯　中国科学院地球化学研究所的无产阶级革命派，在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，正确解决了革命派内部之间的分歧，巩固了革命的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”临时权力机构的建立，为批深、批透、批倒、批臭党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派创造了条件。
    文化大革命运动开始阶段，这个所的无产阶级革命派，团结一致，共同对敌，同科学院、贵州省委、贵阳市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了坚决的斗争。但是，随着运动的发展，由于存在一些具体分歧，逐渐形成了两派。后来通过内部整风和学习贵阳棉纺厂的经验，双方基本上统一了认识，在求大同存小异的前提下，联合起来了。但是，不少同志在思想上还没有完全联合起来，因此在对待“三结合”领导班子的人选问题上，分歧又重新出现了。
    《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》一文发表以后，这个所的每个无产阶级革命派战士都强烈地意识到：向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的伟大战役开始了。这是当前最大的政治，是斗争的大方向。在这两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，必须立即停止“内战”，团结对敌。
    为了进一步消除分歧，真正从思想上团结起来，这个所的无产阶级革命派，针对着革命派内部存在的问题，学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》和《毛主席语录》的有关部分，检查了过去对待干部和群众运动中的缺点和错误，决心真正按照毛主席的教导办事。双方都采取主动，开座谈会交换意见，进行自我批评。大家认识到：无产阶级革命派一定要紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，对敌要狠，对己要和；对于革命派的缺点和错误，要互相热情地帮助，通过整风和正常的辩论来加以克服；对具体事物要作具体分析，不要轻易给革命同志扣大帽子；更重要的是，必须在斗争中活学活用“老三篇”，不断地破私立公，克服风头主义、小团体主义、个人主义、无政府主义等思想。通过这些活动，无产阶级革命派消除了隔阂，增进了团结，巩固了大联合。
    《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章的发表，使许多干部更加认清了斗争的大方向，纷纷起来投入批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的群众运动，愤怒控诉《修养》对自己的毒害。干部的革命行动，受到了广大革命群众的欢迎。有的同志说：过去我们对干部的认识有些片面，影响了“三结合”的顺利进展。通过对《修养》的批判，认识到原来比较好而犯有错误的领导干部，既是资产阶级反动路线的执行者，也是受害者。现在，他们能大胆地站出来揭发批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，说明他们是要革命的。有的同志说：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，把我们的干部说得一无是处，就是为了挑拨干部和群众的关系，企图达到“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的目的。我们决不能上当，一定要和革命干部团结起来。
    地球化学研究所的无产阶级革命派，进一步按照毛主席的教导：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”对干部作了阶级分析，对于在运动中犯了错误的革命干部，坚决实行“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针，采取一看二帮的态度。例如，对研究所原党委书记，既看到他在运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线，更看到他后来同省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了斗争。因此，决定帮助他进一步起来革命。革命派多次找他谈话，开小会帮助，让他有机会向革命群众作自我揭发批判，表明自己坚决改正错误，跟毛主席闹革命的决心。但是，他能否作为革命“三结合”的对象呢？当时还有分歧。在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的共同斗争中，原党委书记积极站出来，愤怒地控诉了《修养》对自己的毒害，态度诚恳，认识比较深刻。他的这一革命行动，受到广大革命群众的欢迎，获得全所绝大多数同志的信任，终于被推选为革命的“三结合”的对象。
