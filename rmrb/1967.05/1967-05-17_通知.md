Notice

To the various central bureaus, the party committees of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the party groups and committees of central departments, state organs, and various people's organizations, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army:

The Central Committee has decided to revoke the "Outline Report on the Current Academic Discussion" circulated by the Central Committee on February 12, 1966, and to dissolve the original "Cultural Revolution Group of Five" and its office. A new Cultural Revolution Group will be established, directly under the Standing Committee of the Politburo. The so-called "Outline Report of the Group of Five" is fundamentally wrong. It goes against the line of the socialist cultural revolution proposed by the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and against the guiding principles on the class struggle in socialist society adopted by the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962. This outline, regarding the great proletarian cultural revolution led and initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, and Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions at the Central Work Conference from September to October 1965 (i.e., at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Politburo attended by responsible comrades of the various central bureaus) on criticizing Wu Han, has been secretly opposed and vigorously resisted. The so-called "Outline Report of the Group of Five" was actually a report drafted by Peng Zhen alone, fabricated behind the backs of the members of the "Group of Five," including Comrade Kang Sheng and other comrades, according to his own views. Regarding such an important document concerning the overall situation of the socialist revolution, Peng Zhen did not discuss or consult with anyone within the "Group of Five," did not seek opinions from any local party committees, did not state that it was to be submitted to the Central Committee for review as an official document, and even did not obtain the approval of Chairman Mao Zedong. He used extremely improper methods, acted arbitrarily, abused his authority, and usurped the name of the Central Committee to hastily issue it to the entire party.

The main errors of this outline are as follows:

(1) This outline stands on the bourgeois standpoint and uses the bourgeois worldview to view the current situation and nature of academic criticism, completely reversing the enemy-people relationship. Our country is facing a great high tide of proletarian cultural revolution. This high tide powerfully impacts all the rotten ideological and cultural positions still held by the bourgeoisie and feudal remnants. This outline does not encourage the entire party to mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and proletarian cultural warriors to continue to charge forward, but instead tries to pull this movement to the right. This outline uses confused, self-contradictory, and hypocritical language to obscure the sharp class struggle on the current cultural and ideological front, especially to obscure the purpose of this great struggle, which is to criticize Wu Han and other representatives of the bourgeoisie who are anti-party and anti-socialist (there are such representatives of the bourgeoisie in the Central Committee and its various organs, and in the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions). This outline does not mention the key point that Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out—that the essence of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is the issue of dismissal—and conceals the serious political nature of this struggle.

(2) This outline goes against the fundamental Marxist proposition that all class struggles are political struggles. When the press just touched upon the political issues in Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," the authors of the outline proposed that "the discussion in the press should not be limited to political issues and should fully develop discussions on various academic and theoretical issues." They also claimed in various settings that the criticism of Wu Han should not touch on the key issues, should not involve the issue of dismissing right-opportunist elements at the Lushan Conference in 1959, and should not discuss the anti-party and anti-socialist issues of Wu Han and others. Comrade Mao Zedong often tells us that the struggle against the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere is a long-term class struggle and cannot be resolved by hastily drawing a political conclusion. Peng Zhen deliberately spread rumors, telling many people that the Chairman thought that the criticism of Wu Han could draw a political conclusion in two months. He also said that political issues would be discussed two months later. His purpose was to bring the political struggle in the cultural sphere into the so-called "pure academic" discussion frequently advocated by the bourgeoisie. It is clear that this is to oppose the prominence of proletarian politics and to promote bourgeois politics.

(3) The outline particularly emphasizes the so-called "letting loose," but it uses sleight of hand to completely distort Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of "letting loose" at the National Propaganda Work Conference in March 1957, erasing the class content of "letting loose." It was precisely when discussing this issue that Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "We still have to wage a long-term struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology. Not understanding this situation, giving up ideological struggle, is wrong. All erroneous ideas, all poisonous weeds, all monsters and ghosts, must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." He also said, "Letting loose means letting everyone speak their minds, making people dare to speak, dare to criticize, and dare to debate." This outline, however, opposes the exposure of the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat. Its so-called "letting loose" is bourgeois liberalization, allowing only the bourgeoisie to let loose, not allowing the proletariat to let loose, not allowing the proletariat to counterattack the bourgeoisie, and protecting reactionary representatives of the bourgeoisie like Wu Han. The outline's so-called "letting loose" is anti-Mao Zedong Thought and adapts to the needs of the bourgeoisie.

(4) When we began to counter the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, the authors of the outline proposed, "In the face of truth, everyone is equal." This slogan is a bourgeois slogan. They use this slogan to protect the bourgeoisie, oppose the proletariat, oppose Marxism-Leninism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, completely denying the class nature of truth. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between Marxist-Leninist truth and the fallacies of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind, and there is no talk of equality. The proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, the proletariat's dictatorship in the superstructure, including various cultural spheres, the proletariat's continued elimination of representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Communist Party and are waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, etc., on these fundamental issues, can there be any talk of equality? For decades, the old Social Democrats and modern revisionists have never allowed the proletariat to have any equality with the bourgeoisie. They completely deny that the history of human society for thousands of years is a history of class struggle, completely deny the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, completely deny the revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie. On the contrary, they are loyal dogs of the bourgeoisie and imperialism, together with the bourgeoisie and imperialism, insisting on the ideological system of the bourgeoisie oppressing and exploiting the proletariat and the capitalist social system, opposing the ideological system of Marxism-Leninism and the socialist social system. They are a group of anti-communist, anti-people counter-revolutionaries, and their struggle with us is a struggle to the death, with no talk of equality. Therefore, our struggle against them can only be a struggle to the death, and our relationship with them is absolutely not one of equality, but one of a class oppressing another class, that is, the proletariat's dictatorship or dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, and cannot be any other relationship, such as the so-called equal relationship, the relationship of peaceful coexistence between the exploited class and the exploiting class, the relationship of benevolence and morality, etc.

(5) The outline states, "We must not only politically defeat the opponent but also truly and greatly surpass and defeat the opponent in academic and professional standards." This idea of not distinguishing classes in academia is also very wrong. The truth that the proletariat has grasped in academia, the truth of Marxism-Leninism, the truth of Mao Zedong Thought, has long since greatly surpassed and defeated the bourgeoisie. The formulation of the outline shows the authors' flattery and elevation of the so-called "academic authorities" of the bourgeoisie, and their hostility and suppression of a group of representatives of the proletariat in the academic world who are new and fighting forces.

(6) Chairman Mao often says, "Without destruction, there can be no construction." Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction at the forefront, construction is also within it. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have been established and continuously developed in the struggle to destroy the ideological system of the bourgeoisie. But this outline emphasizes, "Without construction, it is impossible to achieve true and thorough destruction." This is actually to not allow the destruction of bourgeois ideology and not allow the construction of proletarian ideology, directly opposing Chairman Mao's thoughts, and going against our revolutionary struggle to thoroughly destroy bourgeois ideology on the cultural front, not allowing proletarian revolution.

(7) The outline proposes, "Do not be arbitrary and oppressive like a scholar-bureaucrat," and also says, "Beware of leftist academic workers taking the road of bourgeois experts and scholar-bureaucrats." What is a "scholar-bureaucrat"? Who is a "scholar-bureaucrat"? Does the proletariat not want dictatorship, not want to defeat the bourgeoisie? Does the proletariat's academia not want to defeat and eliminate bourgeois academia? Is the proletariat's academia defeating and eliminating bourgeois academia "scholar-bureaucratism"? The outline's target of opposition is clearly the leftist proletariat, obviously intending to put the label of "scholar-bureaucrat" on Marxist-Leninists, turning around to support the true scholar-bureaucrats of the bourgeoisie, and maintaining their shaky monopoly position in the academic world. In fact, those within the party who support the scholar-bureaucrats of the bourgeoisie, those bourgeois representatives who infiltrate the party to protect the scholar-bureaucrats of the bourgeoisie, are the ones who do not read, do not look at newspapers, do not contact the masses, have no knowledge, rely solely on "arbitrariness and oppression," and usurp the name of the party, the big party bureaucrats.

(8) The authors of the outline have ulterior motives, deliberately muddying the waters, confusing class lines, and shifting the target of struggle, proposing to conduct a "rectification" of "firm leftists." Their main purpose in hastily throwing out this outline is to attack the leftist proletariat. They specially collect materials on the leftists, find various excuses to attack the leftists, and want to further attack the leftists under the name of "rectification," attempting to disintegrate the leftist ranks. They openly resist Chairman Mao's clear instructions to protect the leftists, support the leftists, and emphasize the establishment and expansion of the leftist ranks. On the other hand, they cover up the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, the revisionists, and the traitors, labeling them as "firm leftists." They use this method to try to boost the morale of the bourgeois rightists and suppress the morale of the leftist proletariat. They are full of hatred for the proletariat and full of love for the bourgeoisie. This is the bourgeois philanthropy of the authors of the outline.

(9) Just as the proletariat is launching a new and fierce struggle against the representatives of the bourgeoisie on the ideological front, and many aspects and places have not yet joined the struggle, or although they have already started the struggle, the vast majority of party committees still do not understand, are not serious, and are not effective in leading this great struggle, the outline repeatedly emphasizes that in the struggle there must be so-called "leadership," "caution," "prudence," and "approval from relevant leadership organs." These are all to set many frames and many rules for the leftist proletariat, to tie the hands and feet of the leftist proletariat, and to set up many obstacles for the proletarian cultural revolution. In a word, they are eager to apply the brakes and launch a counterattack. The authors of the outline are extremely resentful of the articles of the leftist proletariat that counterattack the reactionary "authorities" of the bourgeoisie that have already been published, and they suppress those that have not been published. They allow all monsters and ghosts to come out, filling our newspapers, radio, periodicals, books, textbooks, lectures, literary works, films, dramas, folk arts, fine arts, music, and dance for many years, never advocating to be led by the proletariat, and never needing approval. This contrast can show the position of the authors of the outline.

(10) The current struggle is about whether to implement or resist Comrade Mao Zedong's line on the cultural revolution. But the outline says, "We must, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, open up the path to solve this problem (referring to 'thoroughly eliminating bourgeois ideology in the academic field')." Comrade Mao Zedong's works such as "On New Democracy," "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," "Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe After Watching 'Adventure to Liangshan,'" "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China" have long opened the path for us proletarians on the cultural and ideological front. The outline, however, thinks that Mao Zedong Thought has not yet opened the path for us and wants to open a new path. The outline is attempting to use the banner of "under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought" as a cover to open a path contrary to Mao Zedong Thought, that is, the path of modern revisionism, which is the path of bourgeois restoration.

In summary, this outline is against carrying the socialist revolution to the end, against the line of the cultural revolution of the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong, striking at the leftist proletariat, covering up the rightist bourgeoisie, and preparing public opinion for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. This outline is a reflection of bourgeois ideology within the party and is thoroughly revisionist. The struggle against this revisionist line is not a small matter but a matter of vital importance to the fate and future of our party and state, to the future appearance of our party and state, and also to the world revolution.

All levels of party committees must immediately stop executing the "Outline Report on the Current Academic Discussion by the Cultural Revolution Group of Five." The entire party must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, raise high the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the reactionary stance of the so-called "academic authorities" who are anti-party and anti-socialist, thoroughly criticize the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing circles, and seize the leadership in these cultural spheres. To achieve this, it is necessary to simultaneously criticize and cleanse the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, government, military, and various cultural circles, and some should be transferred from their positions. It is particularly not allowed to trust these people to do the work of leading the cultural revolution, and many people have been and are doing this kind of work, which is extremely dangerous.

The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, government, military, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these figures have been exposed by us, some have not, and some are being trusted by us and are being cultivated as our successors, such as figures like Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side, and all levels of party committees must pay full attention to this.

This notice, along with the erroneous document issued by the Central Committee on February 12 this year, should be sent to the county committees, party committees of cultural organs, and party committees at the regiment level of the military, asking them to discuss which document is erroneous and which is correct, their own understanding, their achievements, and their errors.

    通知
    中国共产党中央委员会
    （一九六六年五月十六日）各中央局，各省、市、自治区党委，中央各部委，国家机关各部门和各人民团体党组、党委，人民解放军总政治部：
    中央决定撤销一九六六年二月十二日批转的《文化革命五人小组关于当前学术讨论的汇报提纲》，撤销原来的“文化革命五人小组”及其办事机构，重新设立文化革命小组，隶属于政治局常委之下。所谓“五人小组”的汇报提纲是根本错误的，是违反中央和毛泽东同志提出的社会主义文化革命的路线的，是违反一九六二年党的八届十中全会关于社会主义社会阶级和阶级斗争问题的指导方针的。这个提纲，对毛泽东同志亲自领导和发动的这场文化大革命，对毛泽东同志在一九六五年九月至十月间中央工作会议上（即在一次有各中央局负责同志参加的中央政治局常委会议上）关于批判吴晗的指示，阳奉阴违，竭力抗拒。所谓“五人小组”的汇报提纲，实际上只是彭真一个人的汇报提纲，是彭真背着“五人小组”成员康生同志和其他同志，按照他自己的意见制造出来的。对待这样一个关系到社会主义革命全局的重大问题的文件，彭真根本没有在“五人小组”内讨论过、商量过，没有向任何地方党委征求过意见，没有说明要作为中央正式文件提请中央审查，更没有得到中央主席毛泽东同志的同意，采取了极不正当的手段，武断专横，滥用职权，盗窃中央的名义，匆匆忙忙发到全党。
    这个提纲的主要错误如下：
    （一）这个提纲站在资产阶级的立场上，用资产阶级世界观来看待当前学术批判的形势和性质，根本颠倒了敌我关系。我国正面临着一个伟大的无产阶级文化革命的高潮。这个高潮有力地冲击着资产阶级和封建残余还保存的一切腐朽的思想阵地和文化阵地。这个提纲，不是鼓舞全党放手发动广大的工农兵群众和无产阶级的文化战士继续冲锋前进，而是力图把这个运动拉向右转。这个提纲用混乱的、自相矛盾的、虚伪的词句，模糊了当前文化思想战线上的尖锐的阶级斗争，特别是模糊了这场大斗争的目的是对吴晗及其他一大批反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物（中央和中央各机关，各省、市、自治区，都有这样一批资产阶级代表人物）的批判。这个提纲不提毛主席一再指出的吴晗《海瑞罢官》的要害是罢官问题，掩盖这场斗争的严重的政治性质。
    （二）这个提纲违背了一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争这一个马克思主义的基本论点。当报刊上刚刚涉及吴晗《海瑞罢官》的政治问题的时候，提纲的作者们竟然提出“在报刊上的讨论不要局限于政治问题，要把涉及到各种学术理论的问题，充分地展开讨论”。他们又在各种场合宣称，对吴晗的批判，不准谈要害问题，不准涉及一九五九年庐山会议对右倾机会主义分子的罢官问题，不准谈吴晗等反党反社会主义的问题。毛泽东同志经常告诉我们，同资产阶级在意识形态上的斗争，是长期的阶级斗争，不是匆忙做一个政治结论就可以解决。彭真有意造谣，对许多人说，主席认为对吴晗的批判可以在两个月后做政治结论。又说，两个月后再谈政治问题。他的目的，就是要把文化领域的政治斗争，纳入资产阶级经常宣扬的所谓“纯学术”讨论。很明显，这是反对突出无产阶级的政治，而要突出资产阶级的政治。
    （三）提纲特别强调所谓“放”，但是却用偷天换日的手法，根本歪曲了毛泽东同志一九五七年三月在党的全国宣传工作会议上所讲的放的方针，抹煞放的阶级内容。毛泽东同志正是在讲这个问题的时候指出，“我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”又说，“放，就是放手让大家讲意见，使人们敢于说话，敢于批评，敢于争论”。这个提纲却把“放”同无产阶级对于资产阶级反动立场的揭露对立起来。它的所谓“放”，是资产阶级的自由化，只许资产阶级放，不许无产阶级放，不许无产阶级反击资产阶级，是包庇吴晗这一类的反动的资产阶级代表人物。这个提纲的所谓“放”，是反毛泽东思想的，是适应资产阶级需要的。
    （四）在我们开始反击资产阶级猖狂进攻的时候，提纲的作者们却提出，“在真理面前人人平等”。这个口号是资产阶级的口号。他们用这个口号保护资产阶级，反对无产阶级，反对马克思列宁主义，反对毛泽东思想，根本否认真理的阶级性。无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，马克思主义的真理同资产阶级以及一切剥削阶级的谬论的斗争，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，根本谈不上什么平等。无产阶级对资产阶级斗争，无产阶级对资产阶级专政，无产阶级在上层建筑其中包括在各个文化领域的专政，无产阶级继续清除资产阶级钻在共产党内打着红旗反红旗的代表人物等等，在这些基本问题上，难道能够允许有什么平等吗？几十年以来的老的社会民主党和十几年以来的现代修正主义，从来就不允许无产阶级同资产阶级有什么平等。他们根本否认几千年的人类历史是阶级斗争史，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，根本否认无产阶级对资产阶级的革命和对资产阶级的专政。相反，他们是资产阶级、帝国主义的忠实走狗，同资产阶级、帝国主义一道，坚持资产阶级压迫、剥削无产阶级的思想体系和资本主义的社会制度，反对马克思列宁主义的思想体系和社会主义的社会制度。他们是一群反共、反人民的反革命分子，他们同我们的斗争是你死我活的斗争，丝毫谈不到什么平等。因此，我们对他们的斗争也只能是一场你死我活的斗争，我们对他们的关系绝对不是什么平等的关系，而是一个阶级压迫另一个阶级的关系，即无产阶级对资产阶级实行独裁或专政的关系，而不能是什么别的关系，例如所谓平等关系、被剥削阶级同剥削阶级的和平共处关系、仁义道德关系等等。
    （五）提纲说，“不仅要在政治上压倒对方，而且要在学术和业务的水准上真正大大地超过和压倒对方”。这种对学术不分阶级界限的思想，也是很错误的。无产阶级在学术上所掌握的真理，马克思列宁主义的真理，毛泽东思想的真理，早已大大地超过了和压倒了资产阶级。提纲的提法，表现了作者吹捧和抬高资产阶级的所谓“学术权威”，仇视和压制我们在学术界的一批代表无产阶级的、战斗的新生力量。
    （六）毛主席经常说，不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就是在破资产阶级思想体系的斗争中建立和不断发展起来的。但这个提纲却强调“没有立，就不可能达到真正、彻底的破”。这实际上是对资产阶级的思想不准破，对无产阶级的思想不准立，是同毛主席的思想针锋相对的，是同我们在文化战线上进行大破资产阶级意识形态的革命斗争背道而驰的，是不准无产阶级革命。
    （七）提纲提出“不要象学阀一样武断和以势压人”，又说“警惕左派学术工作者走上资产阶级专家、学阀的道路”。究竟什么是“学阀”？谁是“学阀”？难道无产阶级不要专政，不要压倒资产阶级？难道无产阶级的学术不要压倒和消灭资产阶级的学术？难道无产阶级学术压倒和消灭资产阶级学术，就是“学阀”？提纲反对的锋芒是指向无产阶级左派，显然是要给马克思列宁主义者戴上“学阀”这顶帽子，倒过来支持真正的资产阶级的学阀，维持他们在学术界的摇摇欲坠的垄断地位。其实，那些支持资产阶级学阀的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，那些钻进党内保护资产阶级学阀的资产阶级代表人物，才是不读书、不看报、不接触群众、什么学问也没有、专靠“武断和以势压人”、窃取党的名义的大党阀。
    （八）提纲的作者们别有用心，故意把水搅浑，混淆阶级阵线，转移斗争目标，提出要对“坚定的左派”进行“整风”。他们这样急急忙忙抛出这个提纲的主要目的，就是要整无产阶级左派。他们专门收集左派的材料，寻找各种借口打击左派，还想借“整风”的名义进一步打击左派，妄图瓦解左派的队伍。他们公然抗拒毛主席明确提出要保护左派，支持左派，强调建立和扩大左派队伍的方针。另一方面，他们却把混进党内的资产阶级代表人物、修正主义者、叛徒封成“坚定的左派”，加以包庇。他们用这种手法，企图长资产阶级右派的志气，灭无产阶级左派的威风。他们对无产阶级充满了恨，对资产阶级充满了爱。这就是提纲作者们的资产阶级的博爱观。
    （九）正当无产阶级在思想战线上对资产阶级代表人物发动一场新的激烈斗争刚刚开始，而且许多方面、许多地方还没有开始参加斗争，或者虽然已经开始了斗争，但是绝大多数党委对于这场伟大斗争的领导还很不理解，很不认真，很不得力的时候，提纲却反复强调斗争中要所谓“有领导”、要“谨慎”、要“慎重”、要“经过有关领导机构批准”，这些都是要给无产阶级左派划许多框框，提出许多清规戒律，束缚无产阶级左派的手脚，要给无产阶级的文化革命设置重重障碍。一句话，迫不及待地要刹车，来一个反攻倒算。提纲的作者们对于无产阶级左派反击资产阶级反动“权威”的文章，已经发表的，他们极端怀恨，还没有发表的，他们加以扣压。他们对于一切牛鬼蛇神却放手让其出笼，多年来塞满了我们的报纸、广播、刊物、书籍、教科书、讲演、文艺作品、电影、戏剧、曲艺、美术、音乐、舞蹈等等，从不提倡要受无产阶级的领导，从来也不要批准。这一对比，就可以看出，提纲的作者们究竟处在一种什么地位了。
    （十）当前的斗争，是执行还是抗拒毛泽东同志的文化革命的路线的问题。但提纲却说，“我们要通过这场斗争，在毛泽东思想的指引下，开辟解决这个问题（指‘彻底清理学术领域内的资产阶级思想’）的道路”。毛泽东同志的《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》等著作，早已在文化思想战线上给我们无产阶级开辟了道路。提纲却认为毛泽东思想还没有给我们开辟道路，而要重新开辟道路。提纲是企图打着“在毛泽东思想的指引下”这个旗帜作为幌子，开辟一条同毛泽东思想相反的道路，即现代修正主义的道路，也就是资产阶级复辟的道路。
    总之，这个提纲是反对把社会主义革命进行到底，反对以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的文化革命路线，打击无产阶级左派，包庇资产阶级右派，为资产阶级复辟作舆论准备。这个提纲是资产阶级思想在党内的反映，是彻头彻尾的修正主义。同这条修正主义路线作斗争，绝对不是一件小事，而是关系我们党和国家的命运，关系我们党和国家的前途，关系我们党和国家将来的面貌，也是关系世界革命的一件头等大事。
    各级党委要立即停止执行《文化革命五人小组关于当前学术讨论的汇报提纲》。全党必须遵照毛泽东同志的指示，高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓
  “学术权威”的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。而要做到这一点，必须同时批判混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶级代表人物，清洗这些人，有些则要调动他们的职务。尤其不能信用这些人去做领导文化革命的工作，而过去和现在确有很多人是在做这种工作，这是异常危险的。
    混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。
    这个通知，可以连同中央今年二月十二日发出的错误文件，发到县委、文化机关党委和军队团级党委，请他们展开讨论，究竟那一个文件是错误的，那一个文件是正确的，他们自己的认识如何，有那些成绩，有那些错误。
