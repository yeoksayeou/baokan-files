Comrades,

The great proletarian cultural revolution is a great revolution that touches people to their very souls. It is an intense class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, between Marxism and revisionism, and between the road of continuing the revolution and the road of capitalist restoration. The enemy is right in front of us, and we must thoroughly expose and criticize them, and resolutely root them out!

In this great revolution, some people have revealed their true colors. They are the representatives of the bourgeoisie, the revisionists, and the counter-revolutionaries. They have always opposed the party and socialism, and have been working hard to restore capitalism. They have been using various tricks to deceive the people and undermine the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must be vigilant and never let our guard down. We must expose their tricks and root them out!

Comrades, let us unite and fight together! Let us expose the enemy's tricks and root them out! Let us defend the great proletarian cultural revolution and defend socialism! Let us fight for the complete victory of the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!
