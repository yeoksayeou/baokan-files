The Chinese Working Class is the Main Force of the Cultural Revolution

Shanghai revolutionary worker Yefeng

“Who controls the rise and fall of the vast land?” We, we, we, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of the new world. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, especially in the storm that shook the world known as the “January Revolution,” the working class of Shanghai has always stood at the forefront of the struggle, fully playing the role of the main force.

Shanghai is China's largest industrial production city. The working class of Shanghai, inheriting the glorious revolutionary tradition of their predecessors, under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by our great leader Chairman Mao, together with the broad revolutionary masses, formed a million-strong revolutionary rebel army. They smashed the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, seized power from a handful of capitalists within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road, and established a new order for the proletarian cultural revolution. The great storm of the “January Revolution” that began in Shanghai played a tremendous role in promoting the development of the cultural revolution in various provinces and cities across the country, opening a new stage in the cultural revolution movement.

The working class of our new China is the master of state affairs and a skilled worker on the production front. With our great leader Chairman Mao supporting us and standing up for us, we fear nothing. We seize the revolution; we handle production; we hold the power. We are the genuine proletarian revolutionaries.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we understand the principle of producing for the revolution and striving for the construction of socialism and communism. Therefore, as soon as the cultural revolution began, we used the four weapons given to us by Chairman Mao—big debates, big posters, big character posters, and big discussions—to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalists within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. We established our own combat organization—the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters. Together with the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai, we resolutely fought against the handful of capitalists within the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road, and firmly kicked out these revisionist elements, firmly grasping the power in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries.

Only in a proletarian dictatorship like ours can the working class truly play the role of the main force in revolutionary struggle and production construction. As Comrade Lin Biao, the closest comrade-in-arms of Chairman Mao, pointed out: “Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao at the helm, the workers, peasants, and soldiers have always been the main force of the Chinese revolution. Today, they are the main force of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country, and also the main force of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country.”

However, in the face of such obvious facts, the Soviet revisionist leaders in Moscow, thousands of miles away, dare to spread lies, claiming that the Chinese working class “has not participated in this so-called ‘proletarian’ movement” and that “the proletariat has been excluded from the leadership of the movement,” and so on. They distort black and white and fabricate lies, which is their usual trick. They try to use their own fabricated lies to deceive the Soviet people.

We know that proletarian dictatorship requires the leadership of the working class. So, let us see what position the working class in the Soviet Union is in under the rule of the revisionist leadership, and we will know what kind of dictatorship the Soviet revisionists are implementing. In the Soviet Union, ordinary working people do not have true democracy and freedom. They do not even have the right to defend Leninism. Anyone who stands up to oppose the traitors to Leninism—the Soviet revisionist leadership—will be labeled a “counter-revolutionary,” or be treated as a “madman” and sent to a mental hospital, or be sentenced to prison, losing their freedom of action and even their lives. I remember in 1960, a Soviet ship came to a shipyard in our Shanghai for repairs. A Soviet sailor praised our great leader Chairman Mao while talking to our workers. He said, “Chairman Mao truly deserves to be the great leader of the Chinese people.” Later, the Soviet captain found out and put this sailor in solitary confinement.

The Soviet revisionist leaders are destroying the socialist economic foundation within the country, advocating profit incentives, increased material rewards, new economic “systems,” and so on, creating various pretexts and tricks, actually implementing a set of capitalist management systems, and speeding up the restoration of capitalism. They say nicely that this is to “improve” the material living conditions of the working people. In fact, it is to squeeze more out of the working people to fatten those new bourgeois elements who are officials and lords. The Soviet revisionists use the so-called bonus system and other tricks to numb and corrupt the revolutionary will of the broad Soviet people, attempting to make them not resist.

Today, many heads of industrial enterprises in the Soviet Union are pure bourgeois elements, and their power is increasing. They can arbitrarily persecute workers, fire workers, and the rights of the broad masses of workers to work and live are not guaranteed at all. It is said that in five automobile companies in Moscow and Leningrad, in less than half a year, more than two hundred workers were fired. Recently, the Soviet leaders have come up with a new trick called the “five-day workweek,” which they hype as an “extremely important socio-economic measure of the Party and the government for the laboring people and for the construction of communism.” In reality, this new measure serves to corrupt the thoughts of the laboring people and serves the purpose of “peaceful evolution.” Due to the various measures implemented by the Soviet revisionists to restore capitalism, class differentiation is becoming more serious, and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. Under the so-called “five-day workweek” system, the rich can use these two days off to go out and enjoy themselves, while low-wage workers have to use this time to go out and do odd jobs to earn a little more income.

These facts are enough! It can be seen that today, the working class in the Soviet Union is not only not the master of the country, but is also in a position of being politically oppressed and economically exploited. The reason why the broad working people in the Soviet Union are in such a position today is that the total root cause is the revisionist rule in the Soviet Union. Today, as the working class in China is carrying out a great cultural revolution, we must uproot the revisionist roots. The proletarian cultural revolution in China will definitely inspire the Soviet people to rise up and resist the rule of the Soviet revisionists. How can this not make the Soviet revisionists afraid? Therefore, upon careful consideration, it is not surprising that the Soviet revisionists are so frantically and maliciously slandering and attacking the Chinese cultural revolution. This is determined by their reactionary class nature. We believe that the working class in the Soviet Union, which has a traditional revolutionary friendship with the working class in China, will not believe the nonsense of the Soviet revisionist leaders.

Chairman Mao often teaches us: A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to be tempered and mature, and to have the guarantee of victory. The great working class of the Soviet Union has undergone the glorious revolutionary tradition of Leninism. Today, they have also undergone the negative education of the revisionist rule represented by the likes of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin. They will be tempered through this positive and negative education and will one day raise the revolutionary banner of “rebellion is justified” of Marxism, rise up to fight, and rise up to rebel, and in the Soviet Union, they will unleash a great storm in the style of the “January Revolution,” overthrowing the handful of leaders of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique to the ground, making them never able to stand up again!

    中国工人阶级是文化大革命的主力军
    上海革命工人　叶风
    “问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”我们，我们，我们广大的工农兵群众是新世界的主人。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，特别是在震动全世界的“一月革命”的风暴中，我们上海工人阶级始终站在斗争的最前列，充分发挥了主力军的作用。
    上海是中国最大的工业生产城市。继承了前辈的光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级，在以我们伟大领袖毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线指引下，同广大革命群众一起组成了百万革命造反大军，粉碎了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，从上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派手里夺了权，建立起无产阶级文化大革命新秩序。从上海开始的这场伟大的“一月革命”风暴，对于全国各省市文化大革命运动的发展，起了巨大的推动作用，开辟了文化大革命运动的新阶段。
    我们新中国的工人阶级，是管理国家大事的主人，又是生产战线上的能手。伟大的领袖毛主席给我们撑腰，给我们做主，我们什么也不怕。革命，我们抓；生产，我们干；大权，我们掌。我们是响当当的无产阶级革命派。
    在毛泽东思想的教导下，我们懂得了为革命而生产，为建设社会主义和共产主义而奋斗的道理。所以，文化大革命一开始，我们就运用毛主席给我们的四大武器——大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。我们成立了自己的战斗组织——上海工人革命造反总司令部。我们同上海广大革命群众一起，坚决地向上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了激烈的斗争，又毅然地踢开了这一小撮修正主义分子，把大权牢牢地掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手里。
    只有在我们这样无产阶级专政的国家里，工人阶级才能真正起到革命斗争和生产建设主力军的作用。这正象毛主席最亲密的战友林彪同志指出的：“在毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下的工农兵群众，从来就是我国革命的主力军。今天，他们是我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设的主力军，也是我国无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。”
    可是，在这样明摆着的事实面前，远在万里之外的莫斯科的苏修头目们，竟然睁着眼睛说瞎话，胡说什么中国工人阶级“没有参加这个名为‘无产阶级’的运动”，“无产阶级被排除了对运动的领导”，等等。颠倒黑白、无中生有，这本来就是苏修一贯的看家本领。他们妄想用自己编造的一套谎言，来欺骗苏联人民。
    我们知道，无产阶级专政需要工人阶级的领导。那么，让我们看看，今天在修正主义领导集团统治之下的苏联工人阶级是处在什么样的地位，就可以知道苏修实行的是什么样的专政了。在苏联，普通的劳动人民，得不到真正的民主和自由。他们甚至连维护列宁主义的权利也没有。谁要是起来反对列宁主义的叛徒——苏修领导集团，就要被打成“反革命”，或者被当成“疯子”，关进精神病院里去，或者被判刑，行动失去自由，生命也得不到保障。记得在一九六○年，有一只苏联轮船到我们上海的一家造船厂来修理，一个苏联船员和我们工人谈心时赞扬了我们伟大领袖毛主席。他说：“毛主席真不愧为中国人民的伟大领袖。”后来苏联船长知道了，就把这个船员关了禁闭。
    苏修头目们在国内破坏社会主义的经济基础，提出什么利润刺激呀，什么增加物质奖励呀，什么经济“新体制”呀，等等，巧立名目，花样繁多，实际上就是实行一整套资本主义的经营管理制度，加紧搞资本主义复辟。他们说得好听，这是为了“改善”劳动人民的物质生活条件。其实拆穿了，还不是为了从劳动人民身上榨出更多的油水，来养肥那些做官当老爷的新资产阶级分子。苏修利用所谓奖金制度等把戏来麻痹和腐蚀广大苏联人民的革命斗志，妄图使他们不起来反抗。
    今天，苏联许多工业企业的头头都是十足的资产阶级分子，他们的权力越来越大，他们可以随便迫害工人，解雇工人，广大工人的工作和生活的权利毫无保障。听说在莫斯科和列宁格勒的五家汽车公司，在不到半年的时间里，就解雇了二百几十个工人。最近苏联头子们又想出一个新花招，叫“五天工作周”，把它吹成是“为了劳动人民，为了共产主义建设”而采取的“党和政府的极重要的社会经济措施”。实际上，这个新措施起着腐蚀劳动人民思想的作用，是为“和平演变”服务的。由于苏修推行种种复辟资本主义的经济措施，阶级分化现象日趋严重，贫富更加悬殊。所谓“五天工作周”制度实行后，有钱人可以趁这两个休息日去吃喝玩乐，而低薪的工人不得不利用这个时间出去打零工来增加一点收入。
    这些事实已经够了！可以看到，今天苏联的工人阶级非但不是国家的主人，而且是处在政治上被压迫，经济上受剥削的地位。苏联广大劳动人民今天所以处于这样的地位，其总根源就是苏联的修正主义统治。今天，我们中国工人阶级大搞文化革命，就要挖掉修正主义的根子。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，一定会鼓舞苏联人民起来反抗苏修的统治，这怎么不使苏修害怕呢？所以细细一想，苏修这么疯狂地、恶毒地污蔑和攻击中国文化大革命，就一点也不奇怪了。这是由于他们的反动阶级本性所决定了的。我们相信，同中国工人阶级有着传统革命友谊的苏联工人阶级，是不会相信苏修头目们的一派胡言乱语的。
    毛主席经常教导我们：革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。伟大的苏联工人阶级是经受过列宁主义的光荣革命传统教育的，今天他们又经受了以赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为代表的修正主义统治的反面教育。他们从这正反两个方面的教育中得到锻炼，总有一天会高举马克思主义的“造反有理”的革命旗帜，起来斗争，起来造反，在苏联掀起一个“一月革命”式的大风暴，把苏修统治集团一小撮头子们打翻在地，让他们永世不得翻身！
