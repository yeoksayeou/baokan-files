In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the active members of the study group of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region have made remarkable achievements. After reading the notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the article "A Great Historical Document" by the editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*, they immediately held a study session.

During the meeting, they enthusiastically hailed the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and enthusiastically hailed the publication of the great Marxist-Leninist document, the *Notice*. They firmly declared that they would always stand with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and, following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Below are summaries of speeches made by several comrades at the meeting.

The Focus of Class Struggle is a Matter of "Power"

	Secretary Xu Yongqing

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The bourgeoisie representatives who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have been exposed by us, while others have not. Some are still being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of the Party Committee must pay full attention to this point." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, to expose the Khrushchev-like figures, to expose those who have usurped power in various levels of leadership within the Party and are taking the capitalist road, and to seize back all the power they have usurped, to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen and their backers, the biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party, sensing their doom, hurriedly, behind Chairman Mao's back, concocted the so-called "Draft Outline of the Report," attempting to shift the target of the struggle, to shield the bourgeois rightists, to attack the proletarian leftists, to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao timely exposed their plot and corrected the course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making it advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Once the lid of class struggle is lifted, it is truly shocking. The big and small capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the leadership positions of the Party and the state, though they are only a handful, have seized many key positions from the central to the local levels. They use their power to deceive the masses, to fiercely resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to vigorously promote the bourgeois reactionary line, to build their own independent kingdoms. Once the time is ripe, they will turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. All revolutionary people of our country actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, raise high the banner of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with the Red Guards as the vanguard and the workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main force, forming a vast army of cultural revolution, launching a great attack and sweep against the bourgeoisie, exposing the capitalist-roaders within the Party, exposing the revisionists, exposing the ghosts and monsters, exposing them under the bright daylight, striking them down so that they fall flat. This avoids the great bloodshed of tens of millions of people, avoids the great retrogression of history, and is truly a great relief!

The great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has overthrown a handful of bad elements, strengthened the ranks of the revolutionary leftists, and tempered a generation of red successors to the cause of communism. We, the People's Liberation Army, respond to Chairman Mao's call, participating in the work of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. In the great storm of class struggle, we have also been greatly tempered and elevated. We not only have the ability to fight against armed enemies but also learn to fight against unarmed enemies. In the arduous and intense struggle, the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres, and the People's Liberation Army of Heilongjiang Province have forged a deep combat friendship. We have united to seize the power of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and established a new revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ. This temporary power organ is the most closely connected with the masses, truly revolutionary government. With such a highly proletarianized, highly militant, and highly populist leading cadre, our dictatorship of the proletariat will be more consolidated, and our iron mountain of the people will not only not change color but will be redder and redder with each generation.

    在无产阶级文化大革命中做出显著成绩的黑龙江省军区某部学习毛主席著作积极分子，读了中共中央的《通知》和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》编辑部文章《伟大的历史文件》，立即进行了学习座谈。
    在座谈会上，他们用切身体验，最最热烈地欢呼一年来无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利，最最热烈地欢呼伟大的马列主义文件《通知》的公开发表。他们坚决表示永远和无产阶级革命派站在一起，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    下面是这个座谈会上几个同志的发言摘要。
    阶级斗争的焦点是一个“权”字
    科长　徐永清
    毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”无产阶级文化大革命就是要按毛主席的指示，把赫鲁晓夫式的人物、把埋在各级领导岗位上党内走资本主义道路的当权派挖出来，把他们篡夺的一切大权统统夺回来，保卫和巩固无产阶级专政。彭真反革命修正主义集团，及其背后支持者党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，预感到他们的末日来临，就急急忙忙背着毛主席，炮制了所谓《汇报提纲》，企图转移斗争目标，包庇资产阶级右派，打击无产阶级左派，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，推翻无产阶级专政。毛主席及时揭穿了他们的阴谋，拨正了无产阶级文化大革命的航向，使无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席的革命路线胜利前进。
    不揭不知道，一揭吓一跳。阶级斗争盖子一揭开，真是惊心动魄。混进党和国家各级领导岗位的大大小小走资本主义道路当权派，他们虽然只是一小撮，但却窃踞了从中央到地方的许多要害职位。他们利用职权，欺骗群众，百般抵制毛主席的革命路线，极力推行资产阶级反动路线，大搞独立王国，一旦时机成熟，他们就要变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。我国全体革命人民积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，高举无产阶级文化大革命的旗帜，以红卫兵作为先锋，工农兵为主力，组成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，向资产阶级发起了大进攻、大扫荡，大造党内走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造修正主义的反，大造牛鬼蛇神的反，把他们暴露在光天化日之下，打得他们人仰马翻。这就避免了千百万人的大流血，避免了历史的大倒退，真是大快人心！没有这样大规模的、彻底的革命群众运动，埋在党内的定时炸弹，就挖不到，挖不动，挖不掉。
    伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，打倒了一小撮坏人，壮大了革命左派队伍，锻炼了一代共产主义事业的红色接班人。我们人民解放军响应毛主席号召，参加支左、支工、支农、军管、军训工作，在阶级斗争的大风浪中也得到了大锻炼、大提高。不仅有了同拿枪的敌人进行斗争的本领，而且也学会了同不拿枪的敌人进行斗争的本领。在艰苦紧张的斗争中，黑龙江省广大革命群众、革命领导干部和人民解放军结下了深厚的战斗友谊。我们联合夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，成立了崭新的革命“三结合”的临时权力机构。这个临时权力机构是最能够密切联系群众的，真正革命化的政权。有了这样非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化、非常群众化的领导班子，我们的无产阶级专政就能更加巩固，我们劳动人民的铁打江山不仅不会改变颜色，还能一代比一代更红。
