Syrian Prime Minister Yusuf Zu'ayyin, in a speech at a rally celebrating May Day in Damascus, said that just as the Vietnamese people are not afraid of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, the Arab people will not be intimidated by the U.S. Sixth Fleet.

More than 7,000 Syrian workers marched in a demonstration after the rally, holding banners that read, "The Syrian people condemn U.S. aggression in Vietnam!" and "Eliminate imperialism and Zionism through people's liberation wars!"

Zu'ayyin stated in his speech: The Arab people are well aware that the revolutionary struggle against imperialism will determine the fate of imperialism. "Armed struggle is the only way to force imperialism to withdraw from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Arab people will drive Zionism out of Palestine and British colonialism out of occupied South Arabia and other Arab countries through people's wars and all other means."

He said regarding U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara's threats to increase U.S. and allied troops in South Vietnam, "The heroic Vietnamese people, with the support of the world's people, will continue to fight until they achieve final victory."

He denounced the imperialists led by the United States for plotting conspiracies and military coups in Arab countries. He said the Arab people will not be intimidated by U.S. plots or its Sixth Fleet. He pointed out that the U.S. Seventh Fleet has been used against the brave Vietnamese people, but the U.S. has suffered defeat after defeat.

He said the Arab people will pay any price to liberate Palestine and other occupied Arab regions. Neither the U.S. fleet nor its aircraft can stop the Arab people from advancing.

Recently, Syrian President Nureddin al-Atassi issued an order to annul the technical cooperation agreement signed between Syria and the U.S. "Friends of the Middle East" in 1963, and to stop the activities of the Damascus branch of the U.S. "Friends of the Middle East."

The order states: It has been proven without a doubt that the U.S. "Friends of the Middle East" has close ties with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. spy organizations.

    叙利亚总理谴责美帝在阿拉伯国家策划军事政变阴谋
    美国第六舰队吓不倒阿拉伯人民
    叙政府宣布停止美国间谍机构“中东之友协会”在大马士革活动
    据新华社大马士革电 叙利亚总理优素福·扎因一日在这里举行的庆祝“五一”节大会上说，正如越南人民不害怕美国第七舰队一样，阿拉伯人民也决不会被美国第六舰队所吓倒。
    七千多名叙利亚工人在庆祝大会后举行了游行示威。他们高举着横幅标语，上面写着：“叙利亚人民谴责美国侵略越南！”“用人民解放战争消灭帝国主义和犹太复国主义！”
    优素福·扎因在大会上讲话时还说：阿拉伯人民知道得很清楚：反对帝国主义的革命斗争将决定帝国主义的命运。“武装斗争是迫使帝国主义撤出亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的唯一办法。阿拉伯人民将通过人民战争和其他一切手段，把犹太复国主义赶出巴勒斯坦，把英国殖民主义者赶出被占领的南阿拉伯和其他阿拉伯国家。”
    扎因在谈到美国的麦克纳马拉叫嚷要再增加侵略南越的美军及其仆从军时说，英雄的越南人民在世界人民的支持下，将继续战斗，直到取得最后胜利为止。
    他谴责以美国为首的帝国主义者在阿拉伯国家策划阴谋和军事政变。他说，阿拉伯人民决不会被美国的阴谋或它的第六舰队所吓倒。他指出，美国第七舰队已经被用来对付英勇的越南人民，但是美国还是接二连三地打败仗。
    他说，阿拉伯人民将不惜付出一切代价，来解放巴勒斯坦和其它被占领的阿拉伯地区。美国舰队也好，飞机也好，都阻止不了阿拉伯人民前进。
    叙利亚国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西最近发布命令，撤销叙利亚同美国“中东之友协会”在一九六三年签订的技术合作协定，并停止美国“中东之友协会”大马士革分会的活动。
    命令说：已经无疑地证明，美国“中东之友协会”同美国中央情报局以及其他美国间谍组织之间有着密切的联系。
