Chairman Ho Chi Minh Commends the Glorious Achievements of the Military and Civilians of Hanoi and Haiphong

Hanoi and other areas' military and civilians shoot down 17 American planes and capture a batch of American air pirates

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 7th, it was reported by Hanoi newspapers today: On May 6th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam signed an order to award the First Class Independence Medal to the military and civilians of Hanoi for their many glorious achievements in the anti-American resistance and national salvation cause.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh signed another order on April 29th to award the First Class Independence Medal to the heroic military and civilians of Haiphong, commending the city's military and civilians for their glorious achievements and outstanding results in the anti-American resistance and national salvation cause.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, it was announced here that on the afternoon of May 4th, American bandits dispatched planes to attack a residential area in Thanh Hoa Province, Vietnam, and intruded into the airspace of Ninh Binh and Ha Nam provinces. The military and civilians in the above-mentioned areas shot down six enemy planes with the first round of artillery, including four in Thanh Hoa Province and one each in Ninh Binh and Ha Nam provinces.

The military and civilians of Quang Ninh Province shot down one American plane on May 3rd.

In the afternoon of May 5th, the American imperialists once again brazenly dispatched bandit planes to invade the airspace over Hanoi and savagely bombed some residential areas and economic facilities. The Hanoi residents, who had been well-prepared, immediately struck back, shooting down seven enemy planes and capturing a batch of American air pirates.

After achieving glorious victories in recent days, the residents of Hanoi are even more spirited and stronger in battle. As soon as the invading enemy planes entered the city's airspace, the entire city's artillery roared, forming a dense net of fire that shattered the enemy planes.

It was also announced that the military and civilians of Hanoi shot down one American reconnaissance plane on the evening of May 5th. The militia of Nghe An Province shot down two invading American bandit planes on May 2nd and 6th and also captured American air pirates.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 6th, it was reported by local newspapers that workers and youth representatives of Hanoi held meetings on the evening of May 5th to celebrate the glorious victory of shooting down seven American bandit planes by the capital's military and civilians that day.

The workers' representatives unanimously passed a letter to the Capital Garrison Command at the meeting. The letter expressed their determination to persist in production and be ready for battle at any time, to foil all the plots of the American bandits, and to make contributions to the complete defeat of the American invaders.

Five hundred youth representatives at the meeting passed a resolution expressing their determination to continuously enhance their revolutionary vigilance, be ready for battle at any time, firmly defend the capital, and be ready to respond to the Party's call to go anywhere and do any work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 6th, it was reported by local newspapers that the Haiphong Municipal Committee of the Vietnam Labor Party, the Haiphong Municipal Administrative Committee, the Fatherland Front Committee, and the Command of the Armed Forces sent a telegram on May 5th to the military and civilians of Hanoi, warmly congratulating them on their glorious victory of shooting down seven American bandit planes on May 5th.

The telegram expressed that the military and civilians of Haiphong are determined to learn from the heroic military and civilians of the capital, strictly follow Chairman Ho's teachings, enhance their revolutionary vigilance, be ready for battle at any time, and give more severe punishment to the American bandits who dare to continue their aggression.

The military and civilians of North Vietnam are united in their hatred of the enemy and have dealt heavy blows to the American bandits' mad new "escalation" of the war. The picture shows Hanoi's military and civilians salvaging the wreckage of an American bandit plane they shot down.
