China's Ambassador to Albania, Liu Xiao, held a reception on the 24th.

The film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" was shown at the reception.

Attendees included Albanian party and government leaders Qiaozhani, Baluku, Nushi, Tuosika, Mufutiu, Alia, Kelegia, Kelezhi, Hazi, Duomi, and Pirisite, Vice Chairman of the People's Congress Peza, Central Committee Secretary Spasiu of the Labor Party, as well as various department ministers and military leaders.

Comrade Liu Xiao and Comrade Baluku, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at the reception.

Comrade Baluku spoke about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, noting that the great victories achieved under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong make the Albanian Party and people extremely happy. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is aimed at eliminating bourgeois ideology, removing bourgeois elements who have usurped leadership positions, and blocking the road to revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, thereby ensuring the victory of socialism and communism in China.

Baluku said, "We are deeply convinced that under the direct leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will surely achieve complete victory. We regard the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only as a victory for China but also as a victory of great significance for the world communist movement."

Baluku enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the two parties and peoples of China and Albania.

He said, "This friendship was forged by our two parties, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and Comrade Mao Zedong, and is based on the great Marxist-Leninist ideology. Our two parties are in unity of thought and action, jointly opposing imperialism and modern revisionism led by the Khrushchev revisionist clique. Our two parties have close internationalist cooperation and mutual aid."

Comrade Liu Xiao pointed out in his speech that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a new stage of deeper and broader development in China's socialist revolution. It is a mass revolutionary movement centered on consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, conducted in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's theory that class and class struggle exist in socialist society.

Liu said, Mao Zedong has developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of problems in contemporary proletarian revolution, and solving the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. This is a great milestone in the history of Marxism, and Comrade Mao Zedong's greatest contribution to the contemporary international communist movement.

Comrade Liu Xiao enthusiastically praised the great achievements of the Albanian people under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party in socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially after Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech on February 6, which has sparked a revolutionary upsurge throughout Albania. He said this will further strengthen Albania's proletarian dictatorship and socialist system, prevent the emergence of revisionism, and the restoration of capitalism, thereby having a profound international impact. This demonstrates the far-sightedness of the Albanian Labor Party Central Committee led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people in self-reliance and striving for socialist construction, and the unshakable determination to carry the socialist revolution to the end.

Comrade Liu Xiao enthusiastically praised the unbreakable brotherly friendship and great fighting unity between the two parties, the two countries, and the two peoples of China and Albania.

The large-scale color documentary "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" shown at the reception was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

The reception was held in a very warm and friendly atmosphere.

    巴卢库同志在刘晓大使举行的招待会上说
    中国文化大革命的胜利是世界共运的重大胜利
    新华社地拉那电　中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使刘晓二十四日举行到任招待会。
    会上放映了中国大型彩色纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》。
    出席招待会的有阿尔巴尼亚党政领导人查尔查尼、巴卢库、努什、托斯卡、穆夫蒂乌、阿利雅、科列加、凯莱齐、哈兹比乌、杜米、皮里斯特里，人民议会副主席佩扎，劳动党中央书记斯巴修以及党政各部部长、人民军领导干部等。
    刘晓同志和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、部长会议副主席巴卢库同志在招待会上讲话。
    巴卢库同志在讲话中谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时指出，在毛泽东同志直接领导下的中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的日益巨大的胜利，使阿尔巴尼亚党和人民感到无比高兴，因为中国无产阶级文化大革命是为了消灭资产阶级思想，扫除窃踞领导地位的资产阶级分子，堵塞产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的道路，可靠地保证社会主义和共产主义在中国的胜利。
    巴卢库说：“我们深信，在毛泽东同志直接领导下，在毛泽东思想指引下，中国无产阶级文化大革命必将取得彻底胜利。我们把中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利不仅看作是中国的胜利，而且看作是世界共产主义运动具有重大意义的胜利。”
    巴卢库热情赞扬中阿两党和两国人民之间的战斗友谊。
    他说：“这一友谊是由我们两党、霍查同志和毛泽东同志缔造的，是建立在伟大的马克思列宁主义思想基础上的。我们两党之间思想行动一致，共同反对帝国主义和反对以赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团为首的现代修正主义。我们两党有着国际主义的紧密合作和相互援助。”
    刘晓同志在讲话中指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命是中国社会主义革命发展的一个更深入更广阔的新阶段，是根据毛泽东同志关于社会主义社会存在着阶级和阶级斗争的理论进行的一场以巩固无产阶级专政为中心的群众性革命运动。
    刘晓说，毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是马克思主义发展史上的一个伟大的里程碑，是毛泽东同志对当代国际共产主义运动的最伟大的贡献。
    刘晓同志热情赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了伟大成就，特别是霍查同志二月六日的讲话以后，阿尔巴尼亚全国掀起了革命化高潮。他说，这将进一步加强阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政和社会主义制度，防止修正主义的产生和资本主义的复辟，从而产生深远的国际影响。这表现了以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的马克思列宁主义远见，表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民自力更生、奋发图强地建设社会主义的革命精神，把社会主义革命进行到底的不可动摇的决心。
    刘晓同志热情称颂了中阿两党、两国和两国人民之间的牢不可破的兄弟友谊和伟大的战斗团结。
    招待会上放映的大型彩色纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》受到与会者极其热烈的欢迎。
    招待会是在极为热烈友好的气氛中进行的。
