Today, the revolutionary people of the entire nation solemnly commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This is a major event in our country's political life following the public release of the May 16, 1966, Notice by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's "Talks" brilliantly and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview, systematically and comprehensively proposing for the first time the historical tasks and highest guiding principles of the proletarian cultural revolution. This epoch-making work is a beacon that will forever shine in the revolutionary literature and art of China and the world. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the "Talks" serve as our guiding programmatic document. Its brilliant ideas inspire hundreds of millions of revolutionary people to launch a fierce assault on the bastions of the bourgeoisie.

In the "Talks," Chairman Mao pointed out, "Literature and art are subordinate to politics, but they in turn exert a great influence on politics." In another brilliant work, "On New Democracy," Chairman Mao pointed out: "As for new culture, it is an ideological reflection of new politics and new economy, serving new politics and new economy." Socialist literature and art must serve proletarian politics, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve to consolidate and develop the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system.

What has been the state of our country's literary and art circles since national liberation?

Over the past 17 years, the biggest group within the Party that has taken the capitalist road, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and the revisionist leaders in the literary and art circles such as Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, and Qi Yanming, under their patronage and support, have turned literature and art into a forward position for the restoration of capitalism. They have fiercely resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, spreading a large amount of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist poison, attempting to confuse the minds of the people. By doing so, they serve bourgeois politics, serve the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and prepare ideological conditions for the overthrow of the socialist system and the restoration of capitalism.

Under the control of the revisionists, the literary and art circles are filled with a foul atmosphere of worshipping the past, admiring foreign cultures, and despising the present. Our literary works, films, dramas, folk arts, fine arts, music, and dances are full of ghosts and monsters from ancient and foreign cultures.

In many literary works, "selling out the country is justified" and "exploitation is beneficial" are openly or subtly propagated. The theory of the extinction of class struggle and bourgeois reformism, the philosophy of betrayal and the philosophy of survival are propagated. Some even falsify party history to build monuments for the biggest group within the Party that has taken the capitalist road.

The old Central Propaganda Department controlled by the revisionists has become a hell, and the old Central Cultural Department has turned into a department for emperors, generals, talents, and beauties. These institutions and most literary associations have opposed Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," basically not implementing the Party's policies, not serving proletarian politics, and not serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They have formed a revisionist black line, usurping the leadership of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class does this, and the counter-revolutionary class also does this."

The first socialist state in the world, Lenin's homeland— the Soviet Union, nearly half a century after the revolution's success, was usurped by the revisionist clique and implemented capitalist restoration. One of the important reasons for this historical setback is that the Khrushchev revisionist clique first did ideological work, creating confusion among the masses and preparing public opinion for this small group of traitors to carry out a counter-revolutionary coup.

What a painful lesson for the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Chairman Mao studied the entire history of the Soviet Union, summarized the experience of the Chinese revolution, and in the Central Committee's Notice emphasized that the whole Party must "hold high the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the bourgeois reactionary stance of those so-called 'academic authorities' who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary thoughts in the academic, educational, news, literary, and publishing circles, and seize the leadership in these cultural fields. To achieve this, it is necessary to simultaneously criticize the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural fields, cleanse these people, and transfer some of them to other positions."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a comprehensive class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This struggle, ultimately, is a matter of political power. The main issue this struggle aims to resolve is to seize back from the handful of power-holders within the Party who have taken the capitalist road, including the leadership in the literary and art circles, and put it all in the hands of the revolutionary proletarian faction. This is the direction of the struggle. We must firmly grasp this direction.

All revolutionary cultural workers, ideological workers, and literary and art workers must take Chairman Mao's "Talks" and other works as their guide, stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, actively participate in the great criticism and struggle against the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who have taken the capitalist road. We must combine the great criticism with the criticism of the revisionist black line in literature and art, and with the struggle, criticism, and reform within our units. The literary and art circles must achieve a great alliance of the revolutionary proletarian faction, unite the majority. We must create conditions to achieve revolutionary "three-in-one" combinations, truly seize power into the hands of the proletariat, and build a highly proletarianized and revolutionary literary and art worker team. We must unswervingly implement the principle of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics, create and perform more revolutionary model operas, and create more works. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further understand and grasp the theory, line, principles, and policies of the proletarian cultural revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

In the fields of culture, arts, and ideology, it will take a long time to thoroughly eliminate the poison of the exploiting classes over thousands of years. After the revisionist black line in the literary and art circles is eliminated, new black lines will inevitably emerge. We must fight, and fight again.

We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: the current cultural revolution is only the first one, and there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, the restoration of capitalism will be a possibility at any time. All Party members and the people of the entire nation must not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will bring eternal peace. Be extremely vigilant and never let down your guard.

    无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯
    ——纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    今天，全国革命人民隆重地纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。这是继中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》公开发表之后，我国政治生活中的又一重大事件。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的这篇《讲话》，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的世界观，第一次最系统、最完整、最精辟地提出了无产阶级文化革命的历史任务和最高指导原则。这部划时代的巨著，是中国和世界革命文艺的一盏永放光芒的指路明灯。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，《讲话》是指导我们前进的纲领性文件。它的光辉思想鼓舞着亿万革命人民向资产阶级的顽固堡垒进行冲锋陷阵的战斗。
    毛主席在《讲话》中指出，“文艺是从属于政治的，但又反转来给予伟大的影响于政治”。毛主席在又一篇光辉著作《新民主主义论》中指出：“至于新文化，则是在观念形态上反映新政治和新经济的东西，是替新政治新经济服务的。”社会主义文艺，必须为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务，为巩固和发展无产阶级专政和社会主义制度服务。
    全国解放以来，我国的文艺界是一种什么样的状况呢？
    十七年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，彭真反革命修正主义集团，以及在他们包庇和支持下的周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭等这一帮文艺界的修正主义头头，正是把文艺当作他们复辟资本主义的前哨阵地。他们把持这个阵地，疯狂地抵制和反对毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，大量散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒素，妄图把人民群众的思想搞乱。他们这样做，就是为资产阶级政治服务、为地富反坏右服务，为推翻社会主义制度、复辟资本主义准备精神条件。
    在修正主义分子控制下的文艺界，大量存在着厚古薄今、崇洋非中、厚死薄生的一片恶浊的空气。我们的文艺作品、电影、戏剧、曲艺、美术、音乐、舞蹈等等，大量存在着古今中外的牛鬼蛇神。
    在许多文艺作品中，明目张胆地或者隐晦曲折地宣扬“卖国有理”和“剥削有功”，宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”和资产阶级改良主义，宣扬叛徒哲学和活命哲学，甚至篡改党史，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派树碑立传。
    被修正主义分子把持的旧中央宣传部是一个阎王殿，旧中央文化部简直成了帝王将相、才子佳人部。这些机构和大多数文艺协会，对抗毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，基本上不执行党的政策，不为无产阶级政治服务，不为工农兵服务，形成一条修正主义黑线，专了无产阶级的政。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”
    世界上第一个社会主义国家，列宁的故乡——苏联，在革命成功将近半个世纪之后，被修正主义集团篡夺了领导，实行资本主义复辟。所以出现这种历史的大倒退，其中一个重要原因是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团，首先做了意识形态方面的工作，制造群众的思想混乱，为这一小撮大叛徒实行反革命政变准备了舆论条件。
    这是多么沉痛的无产阶级专政的历史教训啊！
    毛主席研究了整个苏联历史的经验，总结了中国革命的经验，在中共中央《通知》中强调指出，全党必须“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。而要做到这一点，必须同时批判混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶级代表人物，清洗这些人，有些则要调动他们的职务。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下的全面的阶级斗争。这场斗争，归根到底，还是一个政权问题。这场斗争要解决的主要问题，就是要把一切被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的领导权，包括文艺界的领导权，统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。这就是斗争的大方向。我们要紧紧地掌握这个大方向。
    一切革命的文化工作者、思想工作者、文艺工作者，都要以毛主席的《讲话》和其他著作为指南，坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，积极参加对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争。要把大批判同批判修正主义的文艺黑线，同本单位的斗批改结合起来。文艺界要实现无产阶级革命派大联合，团结大多数。要创造条件实现革命的“三结合”，把权真正夺到无产阶级手中，建设一支非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的文艺工作者队伍。要坚定不移地贯彻执行文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的方针，更多地创作和上演革命的样板戏，创作更多的作品。要活学活用毛主席著作，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在文化艺术和思想领域里，要彻底肃清几千年来剥削阶级的流毒，需要很长的时间。文艺界的这条修正主义黑线被搞掉以后，将来还会有新的黑线。斗争了，还得再斗争。
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导：现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
