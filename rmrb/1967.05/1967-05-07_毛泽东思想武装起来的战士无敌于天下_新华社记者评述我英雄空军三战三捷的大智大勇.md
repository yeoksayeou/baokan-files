The east wind is sweeping, and victory reports are frequent. In the midst of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force units have, in eight days, shot down five U.S. aggressor planes that invaded our airspace, achieving a glorious victory of three battles and three victories. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. It once again forcefully proves: great spiritual power can be transformed into great material power; soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible in the world.

The victory of three battles and three victories demonstrates the immense power of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since the cultural revolution began, the participating units have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and conducted in-depth class education. At the crucial moment when the entire nation launched a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the officers and soldiers held numerous discussion meetings and denunciation meetings. Using Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, they criticized "Cultivation of the Self," criticized the capitalist reactionary line, and conducted reminiscences and comparisons, further raising their class consciousness. The officers and soldiers have boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They say, Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work.

The officers and soldiers have boundless hatred for the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The air force soldiers of the participating units, with their actual actions of defending the sacred and inviolable airspace of our motherland, have created new merits and new labor for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In battle, they channel their rage against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party into every action of annihilating the enemy planes. The officers and soldiers proudly declare: "We are the People's Liberation Army created by Chairman Mao personally, the sons and daughters of the people. To defend the sacred and inviolable airspace of our motherland and to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we dare to climb mountains of knives and seas of fire. No matter what new type of aircraft the U.S. aggressors send, we will smash them to pieces."

Chairman Mao teaches us: politics is the commander, the soul. Vice Chairman Lin says: "The human factor is first." The victory of this battle is the victory of Chairman Mao's brilliant military line. It once again shows: those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are the bravest and have the greatest combat effectiveness, capable of defeating all enemies.

Our heroic air force units achieved one victory after another in eight days. What power did they rely on? Was it material or human? Was it weapons or the thought reform of the people? The officers and soldiers responded loudly: We rely on the boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: when the advanced class's correct ideology is grasped by the masses, it will turn into a great material force. The participating air force units, following Chairman Mao's teachings, under the leadership of Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's military line, thoroughly smashed the bourgeois reactionary military line, emphasized proletarian politics, carried out thorough thought reform, and raised morale high. This made every soldier understand why they are fighting. Therefore, in battle, they could be invincible, unstoppable, with high fighting spirit and indomitable courage, to overwhelm all enemies and never be subdued by the enemy. In these three battles, as soon as these air force heroes spotted the invading U.S. aggressor planes, they were filled with boundless rage and indignation, igniting immense fighting enthusiasm. They thought of the U.S. aggressors' mad slaughter of the Vietnamese people, killing and injuring our fishermen, and attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shakes the world. Old and new grievances surged in their hearts. The officers and soldiers had only one resolve: firmly defend national defense, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death, and definitely shoot down the U.S. air aggressors, to add glory to Chairman Mao, and contribute to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Great political enthusiasm produced great combat effectiveness. At the most tense moments of the battle, the officers and soldiers were united as one, fearless of heaven and earth, fearless of death, with courage in every pore, advancing bravely, firing fiercely at the enemy planes, shooting down one invading U.S. aggressor plane after another.

The victory of three battles and three victories is the abundant fruit of actively learning and applying the "Three Articles," a magnificent victory song written with the character "public." It gives a resounding slap in the face to the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party who peddle the theory of the fusion of public and private interests. It vividly proves: only by thoroughly eliminating private interests and establishing public interests can one so decisively and swiftly annihilate the enemy.

In the battle, why were the officers and soldiers so fearless, brave, and advancing? Why could the radar operators, despite the enemy's interference, tightly grasp the enemy plane's trail? Why could the plotting soldiers, no matter how complex the situation, accurately plot the enemy plane's track? The fundamental reason is that they resolutely responded to Vice Chairman Lin's call, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, used the brilliant "Three Articles" to defeat the reactionary "Cultivation of the Self," thoroughly eliminated private interests and established public interests, and in the depths of their souls established the character "public."

Since Vice Chairman Lin took charge of the military commission, the participating units have studied the "Three Articles" extensively, launching a fierce attack on the character "private." As soon as the character "private" rears its head, they use the great ideological weapon of the "Three Articles" to annihilate it, allowing the glorious images of Zhang Zedong and Norman Bethune to occupy the ideological battlefield, cleansing the mud and dirt deep in the soul.

These soldiers armed with the "Three Articles" have all become heroes with the character "public" at the forefront. With the heroic spirit of "overcoming all enemies and never being subdued by the enemy," they launch fierce attacks on the enemy, fighting bravely and growing stronger with each battle. No matter what situation they encounter, they firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, working thoroughly for the people's interests." Even at the most tense moments of the battle, the officers and soldiers were still fighting while shouting: "Spare no effort, annihilate the invading enemy." No one considered personal safety until they shot down one enemy plane after another.

The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party loudly advocate the character "private" and the theory of the fusion of public and private interests, attempting to corrupt the souls of revolutionary soldiers. If according to the reactionary philosophy of the fusion of public and private interests, the officers and soldiers went into battle with private thoughts, they would not have the great wisdom and courage, and it would be impossible to achieve consecutive victories.

The officers and soldiers of the participating units said well: "Facing the enemy with the character 'public,' one is fearless and advances bravely," only then can one have the greatest combat effectiveness, only then can one achieve merits for the people, and only then can one have the heroic spirit of "I am invincible" in the face of the enemy.

    毛泽东思想武装起来的战士无敌于天下 
    ——新华社记者评述我英雄空军三战三捷的大智大勇
    东风浩荡，捷报频传。在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，我英雄的人民解放军空军部队，在八天之内连歼入侵我国领空的美国强盗飞机五架，取得了三战三捷的辉煌胜利。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。它再一次有力地证明：伟大的精神力量，可以转化为伟大的物质力量；用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，无敌于天下。
                            （一）
    三战三捷的胜利，显示了无产阶级文化大革命无比强大的威力。参战部队从文化大革命开展以来，反复学习了毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述，深入地进行了阶级教育。在全国人民向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的关键时刻，指战员们又纷纷举行座谈会，声讨会，用毛泽东思想作指针，批判《修养》，批判资产阶级反动路线，进行了回忆对比，进一步提高了阶级觉悟。指战员们对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜。他们说，毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针。
    指战员们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派无比愤恨。参战部队的空军战士们，用保卫祖国领空的实际行动，为无产阶级文化大革命创新功，立新劳。在战斗中，他们把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的满腔怒火，凝聚在痛歼敌机的每一个动作上。指战员们豪迈地说：“我们是毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军，是人民的子弟兵，为保卫祖国神圣不可侵犯的领空，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，不管美国强盗派来什么新式飞机，都要把它揍得稀巴烂。”
                           （二）
    毛主席教导我们说：政治是统帅，是灵魂。林彪副主席说：“人的因素第一”。这次战斗的胜利，是毛主席光辉的军事路线的胜利。它再一次显示了：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，最勇敢，具有最大的战斗力，能打败一切敌人。
    我英雄的空军部队，在八天之内取得了一个又一个胜利，凭的是什么力量？是靠物还是靠人？是靠武器还是靠人的思想革命化？指战员们响亮地回答：我们靠的就是光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    毛主席教导我们，当代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众所掌握，就会变成巨大的物质力量。参战的空军部队，遵照毛主席的教导，在林副主席的领导下，坚决贯彻执行毛主席的建军路线，大破资产阶级反动的建军路线，大力突出无产阶级政治，大搞人的思想革命化，把士气提得高高的，使每一个战士都懂得为什么打仗。因此，在战斗中就能战无不胜，攻无不克，以高昂的战斗意志和英勇顽强的精神，去压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。在这三次战斗中，当这些空军健儿们一发现入侵的美国强盗飞机，就怒火万丈，义愤填膺，焕发起巨大的战斗热情。他们想到的，是美国强盗疯狂屠杀越南人民，打死打伤我国渔民，妄图破坏震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命的罪行，新仇旧恨，涌上心头。指战员们只有一个决心：坚决保卫国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命！誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，一定把美国空中强盗揍下来，为毛主席增光，为无产阶级文化大革命作出贡献！巨大的政治热情，产生了巨大的战斗力，在战斗的最紧张的时刻，指战员们团结得象一个人一样，天不怕，地不怕，死不怕，浑身是胆，勇往直前，全力向敌机猛烈开火，把入侵的美国强盗飞机一架又一架地揍了下来。
                          （三）
    三战三捷的胜利，是指战员们活学活用“老三篇”的丰硕果实，是“公”字谱写成的壮丽凯歌。它给贩卖公私溶化论的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一个响亮的耳光。它生动地证明：只有彻底破私立公，才能这样干脆、利落的消灭敌人。
    在战斗中，指战员们为什么这样无所畏惧，浑身是胆，勇往直前？雷达兵为什么能不顾敌人的干扰，紧紧抓住敌机踪迹？标图兵又为什么能做到不论情况多么复杂，能准确地标下敌机的航迹？最根本的原因，就是他们坚决响应了林副主席的号召，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用光辉的“老三篇”战胜反动的《修养》，彻底破私立公，改造世界观，在灵魂深处建立起一个“公”字。
    参战部队，从林副主席主持军委工作以来，大学“老三篇”，对“私”字展开了猛烈的攻击。只要“私”字一抬头，就用“老三篇”这一伟大的思想武器把它歼灭，让张思德、白求恩的光辉形象占领思想阵地，涤荡灵魂深处的污泥浊水。
    这些用“老三篇”武装起来的人民战士，个个都成为“公”字当头的勇士，他们以“压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”的英雄气概，对敌人猛烈攻击，愈战愈勇，愈战愈强，不管遇到什么情况，一心牢记毛主席的伟大教导：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”就是在战斗最紧张的时刻，指战员们还是一边战斗，一边高呼：“全力以赴，务歼入侵之敌。”谁也没有考虑个人的安危，直到把敌机一架又一架揍下来。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大肆鼓吹“私”字，鼓吹公私溶化论，企图腐蚀革命战士的灵魂。如果按照公私溶化论者的反动哲学，指战员们带着私心杂念去作战，根本就没有大智大勇，也根本不可能连战连捷。
    参战部队的指战员们说得好：“带着‘公’字迎战，浑身是胆，勇往直前”，才能有最大的战斗力，才能为人民立功，在敌人面前才有有我无敌的英雄气概。
                                     （据新华社南宁六日电）
