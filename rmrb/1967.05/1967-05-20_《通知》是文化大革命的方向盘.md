The public release of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Notice" is a new call to arms for a comprehensive reckoning and counterattack against the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their black henchmen who have infiltrated various fields. Chairman Mao said: "In human history, any reactionary forces that are about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." Some of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, although they have been removed from office and sidelined, are still alive and their hearts are not dead. We must never forget class struggle, and we must never relax our vigilance. We must stand firmly with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, grasp the overall direction of the struggle, concentrate on criticizing the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the reactionary bourgeois line he promotes, defend the great achievements of the proletarian cultural revolution, and advance the great victories of the proletarian cultural revolution. In the work of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, we must create new merits and new labor. In the struggle, we must push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, study to a new level, and use to a new level.

Where there is class struggle, there is the struggle for power. To acknowledge only the long-term existence of class struggle but not the long-term existence of the struggle for power is not to be a true Marxist-Leninist. The "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is the beacon guiding the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat, our steering wheel, and our family heirloom. We must strive to study it, faithfully implement it, enthusiastically propagate it, and bravely defend it. With it, we can carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end.

    《通知》是文化大革命的方向盘
    班长　王宗武
    中共中央《通知》的公开发表，是向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们伸进各个领域里的黑爪牙进行总清算、总反击的新的进军号。毛主席说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，有的虽然被罢了官，靠边站了，但他们人还在，心不死。我们万万不能忘记阶级斗争，万万不能松懈自己的警惕，我们要坚定地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，集中批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他所推行的资产阶级反动路线，保卫无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果，发展无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。我们要在支左、支工、支农、军管、军训工作中创新功立新劳，在斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，学出新水平，用出新水平。
    有阶级斗争存在，就有夺权斗争存在。只承认阶级斗争长期存在，不承认夺权斗争长期存在，就不是一个真正的马克思列宁主义者。中共中央《通知》是巩固无产阶级专政的指路明灯，是我们的方向盘，传家宝。我们要努力学习它，忠实地贯彻它，热情地宣传它，勇敢地捍卫它。靠了它，我们才能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
