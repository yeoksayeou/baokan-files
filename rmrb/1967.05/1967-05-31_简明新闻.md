The foundation-laying ceremony for the Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Highway, built with Chinese aid, was held in the morning of May 28 in Lumbini, near Kathmandu. According to the agreement signed by the governments of China and Nepal in August 1964, this highway is being constructed with Chinese assistance. The Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Highway is approximately 176 kilometers long. It will be of great significance to the development of Nepal's national economy.

Thousands of construction workers in the important city of Pointe-à-Pitre in the French colony of Guadeloupe held a large-scale demonstration on May 26 and engaged in a fierce struggle with the police who came to suppress them. This intense conflict was sparked by the local business owners' refusal to raise the workers' wages and the brutal suppression of the workers by the local police.

In the face of the enemy's bloody suppression, the construction workers of Pointe-à-Pitre in Guadeloupe fought bravely. They attacked the enemy with stones and used weapons seized from an arms store to fight against the police, injuring more than twenty policemen. The demonstrators also burned fourteen vehicles, five of which belonged to the French airline company.

While directly providing weapons to the reactionary government of India, American imperialism is also using its lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, to supply India with a large number of weapons to oppose China and other neighboring countries of India.

These weapons are sold to the Indian government by the Chiang Kai-shek clique at a very low price and on credit.

Recently, Palestinian students in Belgrade held a meeting at the "Trade Union Hall" to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the occupation of Palestine, strongly condemning the crimes of American imperialism and its lackey Israel, and expressing their determination to fight for the liberation of their homeland and return to their homes.

The traitorous Tito clique, a faithful lackey of American imperialism, used various despicable methods to sabotage and obstruct this meeting. The Tito clique mobilized more than forty police officers and plainclothes agents to monitor the venue inside and outside, and prevented Yugoslav teachers and students from attending the meeting.

The Sato government, following the orders of its American master, secretly drew military maps of Japan for U.S. use. The Japanese authorities, according to the "instructions" of their American master, secretly drew a special-purpose military map of Japan from 1960 to 1964. The Geographical Survey Institute of Japan, after completing the mapping work of the Japanese military map, has been continuously providing various survey data to the U.S. military up to now.
