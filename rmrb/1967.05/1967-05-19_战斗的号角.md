The "Notification" issued by the Party Central Committee on May 16, 1966, under the personal direction of Chairman Mao, has been published. This is a major event in the political life of our country and a major event in the international communist movement. The "Notification" is the programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the action guide for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great document of Marxism-Leninism with epoch-making significance. Its publication is precisely in response to the urgent need for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to deepen and develop. It is like a brilliant lighthouse, guiding us towards new and greater victories.

This document is the torch of revolution, illuminating the path and direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, igniting the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

This document is the proclamation of revolution, exposing the evil plots of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, organizing and mobilizing the broad revolutionary masses to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road!

This document is the battle cry that resonates through the clouds, sounding the call to march against China's Khrushchev—the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road—and shattering their dream of restoring capitalism in China!

In this great historical document, Chairman Mao emphatically points out:

"Those who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles as representatives of the bourgeoisie are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." He calls on the broad revolutionary masses to launch a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the Khrushchev-like figures sleeping beside us. On May 25 last year, it was under the great call of Chairman Mao and the inspiration and guidance of the "Notification" that we posted the first big-character poster to fire at the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by Peng Zhen in the old Beijing Municipal Committee and the old Beijing University Party Committee.

June 1st, we will never forget, on this day our dearest and reddest sun, Chairman Mao, personally decided to broadcast this big-character poster and praised it as the "first Marxist-Leninist big-character poster in the country" and the "Beijing People's Commune Manifesto of the 1960s." The birth of this big-character poster was not accidental; it was the inevitable product of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The Central Committee's "Notification" proposes the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, creatively developing Marxism-Leninism and solving the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a new development of Mao Zedong Thought. It is a spiritual atomic bomb of boundless power. It has given us tremendous encouragement and infinite strength. On the eve of May 25 last year, when we heard the transmission of the "Notification," our hearts were filled with such excitement and exhilaration! It greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and greatly dampened the arrogance of the bourgeois reactionaries. It was the "Notification" that exposed the true counter-revolutionary revisionist face of Peng Zhen, making us realize that he was the chief culprit in suppressing the "Four Clean-ups" movement in Beijing University and carrying out a counter-revolutionary comeback; that the extremely serious counter-revolutionary incident at the "International Hotel" in 1965 in our country was carried out under the support and protection of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road; that the "Report Outline" of China's Khrushchev and Peng Zhen is a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist program to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; that Song Shuo's "urgent directive" on May 14 is a black program of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists desperately struggling and stubbornly resisting; and that we further recognized the reactionary essence of Lu Ping's counter-revolutionary revisionism. In short, it was the Central Committee's "Notification" that made us deeply realize: this struggle is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, a life-and-death class struggle. It was the Central Committee's "Notification" that made our minds more liberated, our eyes clearer, our heads more sober, and our rebellious spirit stronger. Therefore, it can be said: without the Central Committee's "Notification," without the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, there would be no May 25 big-character poster!

The birth of the May 25 big-character poster is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. At that time, based on the spirit of the Central Committee's "Notification," we analyzed the situation and believed that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide was excellent and very favorable for our struggle; but Beijing University was still under the stubborn rule of the Lu Ping gang of black elements, and the struggle was still very arduous. Since they still held power, our struggle would definitely be attacked, suppressed, and persecuted by them. Should we give up the struggle? No. Should we "coexist peacefully" with them? Also no. If we give up the struggle and "coexist peacefully" with them, it means betraying the revolution. At that critical moment of struggle, Chairman Mao's teachings gave us courage and strength. Chairman Mao said: "A thorough materialist is fearless, ... 'To dare to be skinned alive, to dare to pull the emperor off his horse,' we must have this fearless spirit when we are fighting for socialism and communism." The great leader's teachings gave us tremendous encouragement, and we decided that no matter what difficulties we encounter, what attacks and persecutions we suffer, we will continue to fight on.

When the big-character poster was posted, it indeed suffered from the crazy attacks, encirclement, beatings, kidnappings, and savage political persecution by the Lu Ping gang of black elements. At the most arduous time of the struggle, Chairman Mao's great teachings of "resolving to struggle, daring to sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and "being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing," inspired us to persist in the struggle! To rebel! To rebel to the end!

The struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines is concentrated in one point: power. The issue of power is the fundamental issue of the revolution. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. The proletariat wants to consolidate its power, while the bourgeoisie tries to overthrow this power. The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, in order to keep the "power" they have usurped from the proletariat, reverses black and white, confuses right and wrong, implements white terror, encircles the revolutionary masses, and tries to suppress the magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, in order to seize back this "power," have waged a tenacious, indomitable, and arduous struggle. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have broken through wave after wave of stormy seas, overcome one after another of rapids and shoals, and achieved one great victory after another. In the battle drums of the decisive struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has been exposed, and the backstage supporter of the restoration of capitalism in China has been dug out. This is the greatest victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Today, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in New Beijing University have seized power! They have taken power! In the long river of human history, one year is just a fleeting moment, but in this one year, Beijing University has undergone a great change! The revolutionary masses of the proletariat have changed from having no power to holding power, and the old Beijing University has become the new Beijing University!

However, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have seized power and taken power, "this is only the first step of the long march," and the road ahead is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. "It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage, and it is not advisable to learn from King Xiang Yu and seek fame." At this critical moment of the decisive struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, we must especially remember Chairman Mao's great teachings. We must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, overthrow, smash, and expose the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road; thoroughly criticize, expose, and smash "Self-Cultivation"; combine the great criticism and great struggle against the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and reform of Beijing University, complete the historical task of struggle, criticism, and reform, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of revolution, the guide to all revolutionary actions. Without the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we would have nothing. All our victories are the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

With hearts filled with immense excitement and exhilaration, we celebrate the publication of the Central Committee's "Notification." This document is not only a document of epoch-making significance in the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people but will also have an extremely profound impact on the revolutionary cause of the people of the world. We must seriously study, enthusiastically propagate, and resolutely implement this great document. We must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, forever uphold the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, forever be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, temper and transform ourselves in the great winds and waves of class struggle, and forever be the little students of the revolutionary masses.

    战斗的号角
    聂元梓　宋一秀　赵正义　夏剑豸　高云鹏　李醒尘
    毛主席亲自主持制定的党中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》公开发表了，这是我国政治生活中的重大事件，也是国际共产主义运动中的重大事件。《通知》是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南，是具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义的伟大文献。它的公开发表，正是适应无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的迫切需要。它象一座光辉的灯塔，指引着我们走向新的更大的胜利。
    这一文件，是革命的火炬，照亮了无产阶级文化大革命的道路、方向，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火！
    这一文件，是革命的檄文，戳穿了彭真反革命修正主义集团的罪恶阴谋，组织动员了广大革命群众向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火！
    这一文件，是响彻云霄的进军号，吹响了向中国的赫鲁晓夫——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派进军的号角，粉碎了他们在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦！
    毛主席在这个伟大的历史文件中，强调地指出：
  “混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”号召广大革命群众向睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫式的人物开展大揭露大批判大斗争。去年五月二十五日，正是在毛主席的伟大号召下，在《通知》的鼓舞和指引下，我们贴出了第一张向彭真为首的旧北京市委和旧北大党委一小撮反革命修正主义分子开火的大字报。
    六月一日，我们永远不会忘记，这一天我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席亲自决定广播这张大字报，并赞扬它是“全国第一张马列主义的大字报”，是“二十世纪六十年代北京人民公社宣言”。这张大字报的产生决不是偶然的，它是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命发展的必然产物，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    中共中央的《通知》，提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题。这是毛泽东思想的新发展。这是威力无穷的精神原子弹。它给了我们巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。去年“五·二五”的前夕，当我们听了《通知》的传达，我们的心情是何等的激动，何等的兴奋啊！它大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级反动派的威风。正是《通知》揭穿了彭真的反革命修正主义真面目，使我们认识到他是镇压北大社教运动和进行反攻倒算的罪魁祸首；认识到一九六五年在我国发生的“国际饭店”极端严重的反革命事件，是在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持和庇护下所干的；认识到中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭真的《汇报提纲》是破坏无产阶级文化大革命的彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义纲领；认识到宋硕“五·一四”的紧急“指示”，是一小撮反革命修正主义分子妄图垂死挣扎、负隅顽抗的黑纲领；也进一步认识到陆平的反革命修正主义的反动本质。总之，正是党中央的《通知》，使我们深刻地认识到：这一场斗争是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是你死我活的阶级对阶级的大搏斗，正是党中央的《通知》，使我们的思想更解放了，眼睛更明亮了，头脑更清醒了，造反精神更强了。因此，可以说：没有党中央的《通知》，没有毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，便没有“五·二五”的大字报！
    “五·二五”大字报的诞生是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。当时，根据党中央《通知》的精神，我们对形势作了分析，认为全国无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，对我们斗争十分有利；但北大仍在陆平黑帮顽固的统治下，斗争还是很艰巨的。由于他们还掌握政权，我们的斗争一定会遭到他们的围攻、打击和迫害。放弃斗争吗？不能。同他们“和平共处”吗？也不能。如果放弃斗争，同他们“和平共处”，就意味着背叛革命。在那斗争的关键时刻，毛主席的教导，给了我们勇气和力量。毛主席说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的，……‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”伟大领袖的教导，给了我们巨大的鼓舞，我们决心不论遭遇到什么困难，遭受到什么样的打击和迫害，也要继续战斗下去。
    当大字报贴出后，果然遭受到陆平黑帮疯狂的打击、围攻、殴打、绑架和野蛮的政治迫害。在那斗争最艰苦的时候，毛主席的“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”的伟大教导，激励着我们去坚持斗争！去造反！一反到底！
    两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，集中到一点就是：政权。政权问题是革命的根本问题。有了政权，就有了一切，丧失政权，就丧失一切。无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，资产阶级妄图推翻这个政权。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了保住他们从无产阶级手中篡夺的“权”，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，实行白色恐怖，围剿革命派，把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命打下去；无产阶级革命派，为了夺回这个“权”，进行了顽强的、英勇不屈的艰苦奋战。在毛泽东思想的指引下，无产阶级革命派冲破了一重重惊涛骇浪，战胜了一个个激流险滩，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的战鼓声中，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了，中国复辟资本主义的总后台被挖出来了，这是无产阶级文化大革命的最伟大的胜利。
    今天，我们新北大的无产阶级革命派夺了权！掌了权！一年，在人类历史的长河中只是短暂的一瞬，但是这一年北大起了天翻地覆的变化！无产阶级革命派由无权变为掌权，旧北大变成了新北大！
    然而，无产阶级革命派夺了权，掌了权，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，以后的路程更长，工作更伟大、更艰苦。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”当前，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，我们尤其要牢记毛主席这一伟大的教导。我们要高举革命的批判旗帜，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭；把《修养》彻底批深、批透、批臭；把对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争和北京大学的斗、批、改结合起来，完成斗、批、改的历史任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛泽东思想是革命的宝，是一切革命行动的指南。没有毛主席的英明领导，没有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，就没有我们的一切。我们的一切胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    我们怀着万分激动、万分兴奋的心情，欢呼党中央《通知》的公开发表。这一文件，不仅是中国人民革命事业中具有划时代意义的文献，而且在世界人民革命事业中将发生极其深远的影响。我们一定认真地学习、热情地宣传、坚决地贯彻这一伟大文件。我们一定要高举革命的批判的旗帜，永远发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，永远忠于毛泽东思想，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼和改造自己，永远做革命群众的小学生。
