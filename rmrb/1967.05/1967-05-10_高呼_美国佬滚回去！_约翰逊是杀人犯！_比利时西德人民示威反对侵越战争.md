Progressive masses in Brussels, Belgium, held an activity on May 6 to "oppose U.S. imperialist propaganda" on the occasion of a large department store in the city conducting a so-called "bi-weekly promotion" for U.S. commerce.

Early that morning, the Belgian Communist Party distributed leaflets to employees of the two stores of the department store, calling on them to struggle against the management and refuse to cooperate with the U.S. Nazi occupiers.

During the day, the "Action for Peace and Independence of All Peoples" organization in Belgium distributed leaflets at the entrances of the two stores, calling on citizens to boycott these stores because they were helping the U.S. Nazis with their propaganda, and the U.S. Nazis should be held responsible for the various crimes they have committed around the world, especially the heinous crimes they have committed against the Vietnamese people.

In the evening, despite tight security, the demonstrators splashed paint on the facade of one of the stores.

Demonstrators also distributed thousands of small slips of paper inside the city's largest department store, with slogans such as: "Yankees go home!" "Johnson is a murderer!" "Yankees out of Vietnam, out of Belgium!" "America is the Nazis!" "New occupation, new resistance." "Don't hang the American flag in Brussels!" "Down with the accomplices of the new occupiers!"

These demonstrations won the widespread sympathy of the public, reflecting the increasingly strong anti-American sentiment among the people of Brussels.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Bonn, West Germany, two thousand young people in Frankfurt recently held a demonstration to strongly protest against the war crimes of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This demonstration took place during the opening ceremony of the so-called "German-American Friendship Week" organized by the Hesse state government, turning the meeting into a mass anti-American demonstration.

In addition to the Prime Minister of Hesse and the Mayor of Frankfurt, a commander of the U.S. troops was also present at the meeting.

The young demonstrators booed and whistled loudly at the mayor who was speaking at the meeting to advocate "German-American friendship." They chanted slogans: "Yankees go home!" "No friendship with war criminals." Their placards read: "End the crimes in Vietnam."

The Hesse state government brutally suppressed the demonstrators' just actions, and the police arrested ten young people.

On the evening of the 8th, five thousand West German student youths held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate in Munich to protest against the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam.

The demonstrators held placards condemning the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and chanted slogans: "Johnson is a murderer!" "Yankees get out!" and so on.

The West German authorities dispatched hundreds of police to suppress the demonstrators, and more than ten young people were injured.

    高呼“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊是杀人犯！”    
    比利时西德人民示威反对侵越战争
    新华社布鲁塞尔七日电　比利时布鲁塞尔进步群众六日趁市内一家大百货公司替美国商业大做广告进行所谓“双周宣传”，举行了“反对美帝国主义宣传日”的活动。
    这天一早，比利时共产党就向这家大百货公司的两家商店的雇员散发了传单，号召他们同资方进行斗争并拒绝同美国纳粹占领者合作。
    白天，比利时“争取和平与各国人民独立行动”组织在这两家商店门口散发了传单，号召市民对这些商店进行抵制，因为它们帮助美国纳粹进行宣传，而美国纳粹应对他们在全世界犯下的种种罪行，特别是对越南人民犯下的滔天罪行负责。
    晚上，尽管警卫森严，示威群众还是对其中一家商店的门面抛洒了油漆。
    示威者还在市内最大的一家商店里散发了几千张小纸条，上面写着：“美国佬滚回去！”“约翰逊是杀人犯！”“美国佬从越南滚出去，从比利时滚出去！”“美国就是纳粹！”“有新的占领，就有新的抵抗。”“不准在布鲁塞尔挂美国国旗！”“打倒新占领者的帮凶！”等口号。
    这些示威活动获得了公众的广泛同情，反映了布鲁塞尔市民中日益强烈的反美情绪。
    据新华社波恩电　西德法兰克福市两千名青年最近举行示威，强烈抗议美国侵略越南的战争罪行。这次示威是在黑森州当局为所谓“（西）德美友好周”而举行的开幕仪式上举行的，这就使得这次大会变成了一次群众反美示威大会。
    参加这次大会的，除黑森州的总理和法兰克福市长以外，还有美国驻军的一名司令。
    示威的青年对在会上讲话鼓吹“（西）德美友好”的市长发出响亮的嘘声和口哨声。他们高呼口号：“美国佬滚回去！”“对战争罪犯没有友谊”。在他们举着的标语牌上写着“结束在越南的罪行”。
    黑森州当局对示威者的正义行动进行蛮横镇压，警察逮捕了十名青年。
    八日晚五千名西德青年学生又在慕尼黑美国领事馆门前举行示威，抗议美帝侵略越南。
    示威者举着谴责美帝侵略政策的标语牌，并且高呼：“约翰逊是杀人犯！”“美国佬滚出去！”等口号。
    西德当局出动数百名警察镇压示威者，有十多名青年被打伤。
