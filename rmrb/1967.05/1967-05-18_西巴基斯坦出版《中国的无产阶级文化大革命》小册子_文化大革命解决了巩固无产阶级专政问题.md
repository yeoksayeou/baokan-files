A pamphlet recently published in the capital of West Pakistan, Lahore, points out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, is "a most creative application of Marxism-Leninism" and "a most precious contribution to the treasure house of Marxism-Leninism theory." It is "a great contribution to the revolutionary workers of the whole world."

The pamphlet, titled "China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" in Urdu, states: The first socialist state established by the great Lenin in the October Revolution— the Soviet Union—has now been controlled by modern revisionists due to the conspiracies of both internal and external enemies. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are trying to force China to abandon its revolutionary stance through their running dogs and revisionists in China, thus dooming the Chinese revolution. The Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has foiled their conspiracies.

The pamphlet also says: This Cultural Revolution has solved the problem of how to defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat after the establishment of a socialist society; this is a problem that other countries and communist parties have not solved. Due to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, China will forever be the greatest revolutionary banner of oppressed nations and oppressed classes, and will more powerfully lead the revolutionary movement of the world proletariat.

The pamphlet says: Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts are sweeping the world like a storm. This is the great contribution made by the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong to the world's working class. Now, to study Marxism-Leninism, one should start with studying Mao Zedong Thought.

    文化大革命解决了巩固无产阶级专政问题
    新华社拉瓦尔品第电　在西巴基斯坦首府拉合尔最近出版的一本小册子指出，毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，“肯定是对马克思列宁主义最富有创造性的运用，是对马克思列宁主义理论宝库的极其珍贵的贡献”，“是对全世界革命的工人阶级的巨大贡献”。
    这本名叫《中国的无产阶级文化大革命》的乌尔都文小册子指出：由伟大的列宁在十月革命中缔造的第一个社会主义国家——苏联，由于苏联人民的内外敌人的阴谋活动，目前已经被现代修正主义分子所控制，美帝和苏修竭力想通过它们在中国的走狗和修正主义分子迫使中国放弃她的革命立场而断送中国革命。由毛泽东主席领导的文化大革命，挫败了它们的阴谋诡计。
    这本小册子还说：这场文化大革命解决了在社会主义社会建立以后，如何保卫和巩固无产阶级专政的问题；而这个问题是其它国家和共产党还没有解决的。由于中国文化大革命，中国将永远是被压迫民族和被压迫阶级的最大的革命旗手，并将更有力地领导世界无产阶级的革命运动。
    这本小册子说：毛泽东主席的思想象疾风一样吹遍全世界。这是中国文化大革命和毛泽东主席领导下的中国共产党对世界工人阶级作出的巨大贡献。现在，学习马克思列宁主义，应当从学习毛泽东思想开始。
