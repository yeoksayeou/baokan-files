Revolutionary comrades, revolutionary friends:

First of all, on behalf of all the revolutionary comrades of the Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Ballet Troupe, I wish our most red, most red sun, our beloved leader Chairman Mao, eternal life, eternal life! I wish Vice Commander Lin good health, eternal good health!

Our revolutionary ballet troupe has, through a year of practice in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and tempering in class struggle, on this day of celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," revisited Chairman Mao's "Talks." We deeply feel that: "Talks" is the most complete, most thorough, and most correct program for the proletarian cultural revolution. It creatively develops Marxism-Leninism, opening a new era in the development of Marxism-Leninism. "Talks" is the most powerful weapon to defeat modern revisionism and bourgeois literary thought, pronouncing the death sentence on the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line. "Talks" is our revolutionary literary and artistic workers' priceless treasure, the guiding light for the world proletarian cultural revolution.

We must use "Talks" to reform our worldview and use "Talks" to guide the class struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic field.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for their use."

For more than a decade since liberation, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists he supports, such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, and Lin Mo-han, have controlled the literary and artistic circles. They have raised the red flag to oppose the red flag, paying lip service while acting against it, refusing to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, distorting and altering the spirit of "Talks," actively promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line, attempting to prepare public opinion for their restoration of capitalism.

In the past, our ballet troupe, under their control, has been deeply influenced by Soviet revisionism, performing foreign classics and "Swan Lake," spreading poison, and becoming a tool for them to peddle bourgeois and revisionist black goods. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party once said: "Watching 'Swan Lake' can boost morale, and the artistic level of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' is also very high." In 1964, he, in order to block the tide of the Cultural Revolution, loudly proclaimed that ballet cannot be reformed and must be foreign to the core, learned to perfection. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." How can the proletariat go "foreign to the core" and "learn to perfection" with the bourgeoisie's art? We must establish something new for socialism and something different for the proletariat.

The thunder roared, and the day we have long awaited has finally arrived. In the spring of 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing personally led the ballet revolution, bringing Chairman Mao's red line into our troupe. The shining beacon—Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"—has pointed out the direction for us to advance. Chairman Mao teaches us:

"For the art forms of the past eras, we do not reject using them, but these old forms, once in our hands, are transformed, new content is added, and they become revolutionary things serving the people." We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, transform this foreign art form of ballet, make it "foreign for domestic use," and become proletarian literature and art "created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and for their use."

But the reactionaries will never give up this position. A great class struggle began in the ballet revolution between the proletariat seizing power and the counter-revolutionary revisionists counter-seizing power.

First, when choosing a script, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo-han immediately proposed to rehearse "Da Ji and Her Father," which promotes bourgeois human sentiment, attempting to lead the ballet reform astray. At this critical juncture, Comrade Jiang Qing firmly held the revolutionary course, decisively deciding to rehearse "The Red Detachment of Women," which reflects Chairman Mao's people's war thoughts, and smashed their plot. During the rehearsal, they played all sorts of despicable tricks, resisting and sabotaging the creation of the revolutionary play. But "Talks" is our revolutionary ideological weapon, inspiring us to resolutely fight against the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line. When artistic creation encountered difficulties, Chairman Mao's powerful voice told us: "Go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers," "go to the only broadest and richest source." He taught us that we must, in the practice of deeply integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from them, truly shift our standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, "only in this way can we have genuine literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, genuine proletarian literature and art." Our entire troupe went to the troops for a short period, and our thoughts and feelings underwent a certain change. It was the golden key of Mao Zedong Thought that opened the door to the artistic creation of "The Red Detachment of Women." After several months of hard work, "The Red Detachment of Women" finally broke through the numerous obstacles and sabotage of the counter-revolutionary revisionists and emerged.

What we will never forget is October 8, 1964. A red sun illuminated the ballet stage, and our most beloved leader Chairman Mao watched the performance of "The Red Detachment of Women." This was the happiest moment of our lives! We could not help but shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao, long, long live!!!" After watching the performance, he enthusiastically affirmed the direction of the ballet revolution, giving "The Red Detachment of Women" the highest evaluation, saying, "The direction is correct, the revolution is successful, and the art is also good." But on the morning after Chairman Mao watched the performance, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lin Mo-han hurriedly rushed to our troupe. He sealed off Chairman Mao's highest directive on "The Red Detachment of Women" but maliciously slandered: "'The Red Detachment of Women' can only be said to be like a baby in swaddling clothes,' saying things like 'an ugly daughter-in-law must see her mother-in-law' and so on, attempting to negate the great political impact of our great leader Chairman Mao watching the performance. But Chairman Mao's voice cannot be sealed off. Chairman Mao's evaluation was a heavy blow to the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and his henchmen. It was Chairman Mao who liberated us from the shackles of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line; it was Chairman Mao who gave us boundless strength. We must carry the ballet revolution to the end.

Under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, we have thoroughly demolished the so-called artistic peak of bourgeois ballet. In this revolution, we have deeply fallen in love with revolutionary plays and deeply fallen in love with the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. It was in the midst of the stormy waves of class struggle in the literary and artistic circles that Comrade Jiang Qing stood out, bravely cutting through difficulties, fearless of the attacks and encirclements of counter-revolutionary revisionism, fearless of hardships and dangers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, leading us to break through the most stubborn fortresses of feudalism and capitalism in Peking opera, ballet, and symphonic music. Under her personal example and guidance, we have come to love our great leader Chairman Mao even more; we have deepened our feelings for Chairman Mao's "Talks"; we have strengthened our sense of responsibility for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. All this has inspired us to charge forward for the new proletarian literature and art, urging us to always follow Chairman Mao's teachings, "definitely shift the standpoint, definitely in the process of deeply integrating with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply integrating with the actual struggle, in the process of learning Marxism and learning society, gradually shift, shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, shift to the side of the proletariat." Struggle to create brilliant proletarian literature and art that are worthy of our great Party, great country, great people, and great army.

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long, long live our greatest leader Chairman Mao!

    芭蕾舞革命的指路明灯
    钟润良同志在首都纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会上的讲话革命的同志们，革命的战友们：
    首先，我代表工农兵芭蕾舞剧团全体革命同志敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳、敬爱的领袖毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！祝林副统帅身体健康，永远健康！
    我们芭蕾舞团的革命派，经过一年来的文化大革命的实践和阶级斗争的锻炼，在举国欢庆毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》光辉著作发表二十五周年的今天，重温毛主席的《讲话》，深深地体会到：《讲话》是最完整、最彻底、最正确的无产阶级文化革命的纲领，它创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，开创了马克思列宁主义发展的新纪元。《讲话》是战胜现代修正主义和资产阶级文艺思想的最有力的武器，它宣判了反革命修正主义文艺路线的死刑。《讲话》是我们革命文艺工作者的无价之宝，是世界无产阶级文化革命的指路明灯。
    我们要用《讲话》来改造世界观，用《讲话》来指导文艺战线上的两条路线的阶级斗争。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”
    解放十几年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他所支持的彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，把持了文艺界，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，阳奉阴违，拒不执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，歪曲、篡改《讲话》的精神，积极推行一条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线，妄图为他们复辟资本主义作舆论准备。
    过去我们芭蕾舞剧团在他们控制下，大学苏修、大演洋人死人，天鹅仙女，大放其毒，成为了他们贩卖资产阶级、修正主义黑货的工具。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派就曾说：“看《天鹅湖》可以提高兴致，《巴黎圣母院》的艺术水平也很高。”一九六四年，他为了阻挡文化大革命的洪流，大肆叫嚣芭蕾舞不能改革，要洋到底，学到家。毛主席教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”无产阶级对资产阶级的艺术怎能够去“洋到底”、“学到家”呢？必须要标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。
    春雷一声震天响，我们久已盼望着的这一天终于到来了，一九六四年的春天，江青同志亲自领导了芭蕾舞的革命，把毛主席的文艺红线带进了我们剧团。金光闪闪的明灯——毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》给我们指出了前进的航向。毛主席教导我们说：
  “对于过去时代的文艺形式，我们也并不拒绝利用，但这些旧形式到了我们手里，给了改造，加进了新内容，也就变成革命的为人民服务的东西了。”我们要坚决听毛主席的话，把芭蕾舞这个外来的艺术形式，改造过来，“洋为中用”，成为“为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的”无产阶级文艺。
    但是反动派是决不会放弃这个阵地的，在芭蕾舞革命上开始了一场无产阶级夺权和反革命修正主义反夺权的阶级大搏斗。
    首先在选择剧本的时候，反革命修正主义分子林默涵立即提出要排练宣扬资产阶级人情味的《达吉和她的父亲》，妄图将芭蕾舞改革引向歧途。在这重要关头，江青同志紧紧把住了革命化的航向，斩钉截铁地决定排练表现毛主席人民战争思想的《红色娘子军》，粉碎了他们的阴谋。在排练中，他们又玩弄了种种卑鄙伎俩，抵制、破坏革命戏的创作。但是《讲话》是我们革命的思想武器，它鼓舞着我们去同反革命修正主义文艺黑线作坚决的斗争。又当艺术创作遇到难题的时候，毛主席响亮的声音告诉我们：到工农兵当中去，“到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去”。教导我们必须要在深入工农兵的实践中，向工农兵学习，把立足点真正移到工农兵这方面来，“只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”我们全团下连队当兵一个短时期，思想感情起了一定的变化，是毛泽东思想的金钥匙打开了《红色娘子军》艺术创作的大门。经过几个月的奋战，《红色娘子军》终于冲破了反革命修正主义分子的重重阻挠破坏而杀出来了。
    使我们永远永远难忘的是一九六四年十月八日这一天，一轮红日照亮了芭蕾舞台，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席观看了《红色娘子军》的演出，这是我们一生中最最幸福的时刻！我们不禁千遍万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”，“毛主席万万岁！！！”。他老人家看完演出后，热情地肯定了芭蕾舞革命的方向，给予《红色娘子军》以极高的评价，说“方向是对头的，革命是成功的，艺术上也是好的。”可是就在毛主席观看演出后的第二天清晨，反革命修正主义分子林默涵就急急忙忙跑到我们剧团，他封锁了毛主席对《红色娘子军》的最高指示，却恶毒地诬蔑：“《红色娘子军》只能说是象
  一个襁褓中吃奶的婴儿”，说什么“丑媳妇总是要见婆娘的”等等，企图抵消我们伟大领袖毛主席看演出的巨大政治影响。但是毛主席的声音是封锁不住的。毛主席的评价给了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其爪牙们当头一棒。是毛主席把我们从反革命修正主义文艺黑线的枷锁下解放出来了；是毛主席给了我们无穷的力量。我们一定要把芭蕾舞的革命进行到底。
    在光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀下，我们大造了资产阶级所谓的艺术高峰芭蕾舞的反，在这场革命中我们深深地爱上了革命戏，深深地爱上了工农兵的英雄人物。就是在文艺界阶级斗争的惊涛骇浪中，是江青同志挺身而出，披荆斩棘，不怕反革命修正主义的打击、围攻，不怕艰难险阻，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线，带领着我们攻破了京剧、芭蕾舞、交响音乐这些最顽固的封建主义、资本主义艺术堡垒。在她身教言教下，使我们对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱；使我们对毛主席《讲话》的感情更深；使我们加强了对中国革命和世界革命的责任感。这一切的一切，都激励着我们为无产阶级新文艺去冲锋陷阵。鞭策着我们时时刻刻地遵循着毛主席的教导，“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来”。为创作出无愧于我们伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的人民、伟大的军队的无产阶级光辉灿烂的新文艺而奋斗。
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！！！
