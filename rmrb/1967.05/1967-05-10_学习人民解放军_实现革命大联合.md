The revolutionary youth of Beijing's 23rd Middle School, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, have used Mao Zedong Thought as their compass and the PLA as their model. They have striven to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of their thoughts, achieving revolutionary great unity, and enhancing the revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline of the proletariat.

	Learning from the PLA, Studying Chairman Mao's Works
The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat comes from the great Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as the PLA entered the school, they placed the organization of teachers and students to study and apply Chairman Mao's works at the forefront. Everyone engaged in propaganda work, with the most enthusiastic political spirit, propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary teachers and students. The first song they sang with the students upon entering the school was "The Boat Needs a Helmsman," the first gift they gave to the students was "The Three Articles" and a sewing kit, and the first lesson they taught was "In Memory of Norman Bethune." In addition to studying Chairman Mao's works with the students every day, they also insisted on studying for more than an hour each evening. The students saw this and took it to heart, deeply feeling that "learning from the PLA, learning a thousand times and ten thousand times, the most important thing is to learn how they study and apply Mao Zedong Thought."

At the beginning, many students could not sit still, could not read, could not study well, and could not apply what they learned. The PLA addressed the students' active thoughts, inviting active members of the army who study Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences and insights with the students. They also used their personal experiences to explain the importance of Mao Zedong Thought in revolutionary work. Through guidance and personal example, they led everyone to gradually cultivate the habit of daily reading and the ability to study and apply what they learned. Now, all teachers and students in the school have achieved the goal of reading, discussing, and applying Chairman Mao's works every day, breaking down selfishness and promoting selflessness, accelerating the revolutionization of their thoughts.

The students love the collective and care about the collective, each striving to do good deeds for the collective. They took the initiative to repair desks and chairs, arrange classrooms, clean the school, and tidy up the campus. Zhang Qingyun decided to follow the examples of Zhang Side and Lei Feng, becoming a revolutionary screw and a servant of the people. She voluntarily went to the reception room every day to deliver mail, find people, and answer the phone for everyone. She was praised by everyone for her dedication to serving her fellow students. Zhang Zhijun and Yao Fuhua, under the guidance of the PLA comrades, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works for more than three hours each day. They also worked hard on their writing, coming to school at dawn to sweep the floors and take out the trash. They always worked silently and never told anyone. Zhang Daheng brought a hammer and nails from home, often sacrificing his rest time to repair desks and chairs in various classes. He repaired seventy-two chairs in total and was praised by his fellow students as a selfless "little carpenter."

	Learning from the PLA, Achieving Revolutionary Great Unity
On the basis of initial thought revolutionization, the PLA conducted in-depth investigations and comprehensive historical analyses. With a firm stance and clear attitude, they firmly supported the revolutionary actions of the four revolutionary organizations, including the Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought. They guided these organizations to correctly handle errors made by other organizations and the masses, gradually overcoming the long-standing differences and estrangements between combat organizations and among students, achieving great unity based on teaching classes throughout the school.

In the past, this school had not thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, leading to many estrangements and differences between organizations and among students. Large organizations believed that their forces were strong and that unity should be based on their leadership; some early "revolutionaries" felt they had contributed greatly and developed a "revolutionary only I" mentality, unwilling to unite; some small organizations feared that after class unity, they would only be commanded by others; those who had made mistakes feared discrimination after unity; those from poor family backgrounds feared being excluded from unity, facing cold shoulders, and retaliation. And so on.

In response to these active thoughts, the PLA guided them to study the brilliant works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," as well as the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." They led everyone to analyze the specific situation of the school, learning to use class analysis methods, strictly distinguishing between enemies and friends, and differentiating between two types of contradictions. At the same time, they learned the PLA's method of holding bitterness meetings, guiding everyone to express their suffering from class exploitation and oppression, and their suffering from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line. This awakened many deceived and misled students, who resolutely broke with the bourgeois reactionary line and returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. One student, who had once executed the bourgeois reactionary line and had not dared to return to school for a long time, made a self-criticism at the meeting this time. She bravely exposed and criticized the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. She dug deep and criticized well, gaining everyone's understanding. The students told her, "We hate the bourgeois reactionary line, but we will not hate you!" She was deeply moved and said, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao, the river is deep and the sea is deep, but class love is the deepest!"

The revolutionary youths, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "grasp ideological education, which is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage a great political struggle," learned from the PLA's four-first political thought work experience. They conducted thorough and detailed political thought work among the students. The core members of the Red Guards in Class 3(5) conducted mass thought mutual assistance activities among the students, with everyone doing thought work, achieving unity of thought, organization, and action throughout the class. Based on the principle of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades, they helped students who had made mistakes to raise their awareness and correct their errors. To strengthen unity and achieve revolutionary unity, various combat organizations held unity heart-to-heart meetings. At the heart-to-heart meeting, everyone started with self-criticism from the perspective of grasping the direction of the struggle. Through frank exchanges of opinions, they resolved the estrangements and misunderstandings between organizations and students. Because everyone could consciously overcome anarchism, cliquism, individualism, and other wrong tendencies, they united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, achieving school-wide great unity based on teaching classes, and establishing a "three-in-one combination" revolutionary committee. Many students deeply felt, "The bourgeois reactionary line split us apart, and today the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has united us again!"

	Learning from the PLA, Strengthening Organizational Discipline
After resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students also learned from the high organizational and disciplinary spirit of the People's Liberation Army, overcoming the lax and disorderly style. Due to the influence of anarchist trends, many students had loose discipline and disorderly actions. Some students did not follow discipline and regulations, doing whatever they wanted, and no one could stop them. In addition to influencing the students with their own exemplary behavior of following discipline, the PLA comrades also repeatedly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "the unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline." They combined this with telling revolutionary battle stories, using many vivid examples to educate everyone to understand that using socialist discipline to constrain oneself is one of the main guarantees for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. After understanding this truth, the revolutionary youths mutually supervised and checked each other, consciously following discipline and regulations. Now, the entire school follows the rules for meetings, classes, and drills, listens to commands, eliminates the phenomenon of truancy without reason, and achieves a 100% attendance rate except for sick leave. Daily life has also gradually cultivated the style of "unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness," with actions militarized and style combat-ready.

The revolutionary youths also took the PLA as an example, cultivating the spirit of hard work and enduring hardships. During a 70-mile round-trip wilderness camping activity, the students insisted on walking, not riding bicycles or using monthly passes. They said, "We lost comfort, but we gained the great Mao Zedong Thought!"

    学习人民解放军　实现革命大联合
    北京市第二十三中学革命的青少年，在解放军的帮助下，以毛泽东思想为指针，以解放军为榜样，努力活学活用毛主席著作，促进了思想革命化，实现了革命大联合，增强了无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。
      学习解放军，学好毛主席著作
    无产阶级的革命性来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。解放军一进学校，把组织师生活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，人人做宣传工作，以最饱满的政治热情，向革命师生宣传毛泽东思想。他们进校门和学生一起唱的第一支歌是《大海航行靠舵手》，送给学生的第一件礼物是“老三篇”和针线包，给学生讲的第一课是《为人民服务》。他们每天除了和学生一起学习毛主席著作外，晚上自己还坚持学习一个多钟头。这些，学生看在眼里，记在心里，他们深深地感到：“学习解放军，千学万学，最重要的是学习他们活学活用毛泽东思想。”
    开始有不少人坐不下来，读不进去，学不好，用不好。解放军就针对同学们的活思想，请部队学习毛主席著作积极分子向同学介绍学习经验和体会，并用自己的切身感受，说明干革命一刻也离不开毛泽东思想的道理。通过启发诱导，口传身教，引导大家逐步培养起天天读的习惯和活学活用的能力。现在，全校师生已经作到坚持天天读，天天议，天天用，大破私字，大树公字，加速了思想革命化。
    同学们热爱集体，关心集体，人人为集体争做好事。他们自觉地行动起来，修理桌椅，布置教室，打扫卫生，整理校园。张庆云同学决心以张思德、雷锋为榜样，做革命的螺丝钉，当人民的勤务员，她每天一有空就主动到传达室为大伙送信，找人，听电话。她热心为同学服务，受到大家的称赞。张智军和姚富华两位同学在解放军同志的启发下，每天坚持学习三个多小时的毛主席著作，并在用字上狠下功夫，每天天蒙蒙亮来到学校，扫地推垃圾。她们总是默默地干，从不告诉人家。张大恒同学从家里拿来了锤子、钉子，经常放弃休息时间，到各班修理桌椅，一个人先后修理了七十二把椅子，被同学们称做公而忘私的“小鲁班”。
      学习解放军，实现革命大联合
    在思想初步革命化的基础上，解放军通过深入的调查研究，全面地历史地进行分析，以坚定的立场、鲜明的态度，坚决支持毛泽东思想红卫兵等四个革命组织的革命行动，并引导这些组织正确对待犯错误的组织和群众，逐步克服了长期以来战斗组织之间、学生之间存在的分歧和隔阂，实现了以教学班为基础的全校大联合。
    过去，这个学校由于资产阶级反动路线没有得到彻底的批判，组织与组织之间，学生与学生之间，产生了许多隔阂和分歧。大组织认为我的兵马多，势力大，要联合就要以我为主；最早“杀”出来的革命派中个别成员觉得自己有汗马功劳，产生“唯我革命”的思想，不愿搞联合；有的小组织人数少，力量弱，怕搞班级大联合以后只能听人家指挥；犯过错误的怕联合后受歧视；家庭出身不好的怕自己不在联合之列，遭冷遇，受报复，如此等等。
    针对这些活思想，解放军辅导他们学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作和《中共中央关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》，引导大家具体分析本校的具体情况，学会用阶级分析方法，严格分清敌我友，区分两类不同性质的矛盾；同时学习解放军开诉苦会的方法，引导大家诉阶级剥削压迫之苦，诉受资产阶级反动路线迫害之苦。这就使一些受欺骗、受蒙蔽的同学纷纷觉醒过来，坚决与资产阶级反动路线决裂，回到毛主席的革命路线上来。有一个同学因曾执行过资产阶级反动路线，长期不敢回学校，这次她在会上向同学们作了检讨，大胆揭发批判资产阶级反动路线的罪行。她挖得深，批得好，得到大家的谅解。同学们对她说：“我们恨的是资产阶级反动路线，决不会恨你！”她深受感动地说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，河深海深不如阶级友爱深！”
    革命小将遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，学习解放军四个第一的政治思想工作经验，在同学中进行了深入细致的政治思想工作。初三（五）班的红卫兵骨干，在解放军帮助下，在同学中开展群众性的思想互助活动，互相交心谈心，人人做思想工作，达到全班上下思想统一，组织统一，行动统一。他们根据既要弄清思想，又要团结同志的原则，帮助犯错误同学提高认识，改正错误。为了加强团结，实现革命的联合，各战斗组织都先后开了团结交心会。在交心座谈会上，大家都从掌握斗争的大方向出发，首先作自我批评。通过坦率的交换意见，解除了各组织和同学之间的隔阂和误会。由于大家都能自觉地克服无政府主义、小集团主义、个人主义等错误倾向，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上团结起来，实现了按教学班为基础的全校大联合，并建立了“三结合”的革命委员会。许多同学深有所感地说：“资产阶级反动路线把我们分裂开来，今天战无不胜的毛泽东思想又把我们团结起来！”
      学习解放军，加强组织纪律性
    革命师生在复课闹革命以后，还学习人民解放军高度的组织性、纪律性，克服自由散漫的作风。不少同学由于受无政府主义思潮的影响，纪律松弛，行动散漫，有的同学不遵守纪律和制度，要怎么干就怎么干，谁也管不着。解放军同志除经常以自己遵守纪律的模范行为影响同学外，还反复组织大家学习毛主席关于“民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一”的教导，结合讲述革命战斗故事，通过许多生动的实例，教育大家认识到用社会主义的纪律约束自己，是巩固无产阶级专政的主要保证之一。革命小将懂得这个道理之后，大家相互督促，相互检查，自觉遵守纪律和制度。现在全校开会、上课、操练都能遵守制度，听从指挥，消除了无故旷课的现象，除病假之外，到校率达到百分之百。日常生活也逐步培养起“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”的作风，行动军事化，作风战斗化。
    革命小将还以解放军为榜样，培养艰苦奋斗和吃大苦、耐大劳的精神。在一次来回七十多里野营活动中，同学们坚持步行，有自行车不骑，有月票不坐车。他们说：“我们失掉的是舒服，但是我们得到的是伟大的毛泽东思想！”　　               本报记者
