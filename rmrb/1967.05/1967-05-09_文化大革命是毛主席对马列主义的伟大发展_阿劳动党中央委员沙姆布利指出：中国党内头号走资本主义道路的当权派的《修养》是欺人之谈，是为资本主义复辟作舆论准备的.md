The Cultural Revolution is Chairman Mao's Great Development of Marxism-Leninism

Albanian Labor Party Central Committee member, Shambuli, pointed out: The "Reminiscences" of the top capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party is a fraud, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

Tirana, May 9 (New China News Agency) - Albanian Labor Party Central Committee member and First Secretary of the Party Committee of Fier, P. Shambuli, said on May 3 at a banquet held by the Fier District Trade Union to welcome the Chinese Trade Union delegation: Our era has Chairman Mao, which is the greatest fortune for all the people of the world.

Shambuli said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being carried out in China has extremely great significance. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution not only concerns the fate of the Chinese people but also the fate of all the people of the world. Through this revolution, those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been overthrown, and the path to the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism has been blocked.

He said, the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China lies in the fact that Comrade Mao Zedong has further developed Marxism-Leninism and solved in practice the problem of how to prevent the restoration of capitalism and defend the fruits of the revolution.

Shambuli praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as being carried out on the basis of the great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. In this revolution, Mao Zedong's mass line has been implemented. The entire Chinese people have participated in this revolution and have shown their great strength in the revolution.

Shambuli said, U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism are terrified of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Their fear and panic once again prove the importance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and prove Chairman Mao's assertion: "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing."

He said, we are very happy to see that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved brilliant victories in all aspects. China is not only vast in territory and rich in resources, with a large population, but also has the great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. Our era has Chairman Mao, which is the greatest fortune for all the people of the world. We wish the great leader of the world proletariat and the closest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong, eternal life.

Shambuli also said, the Chinese Communist Party led by Comrade Mao Zedong and the great Chinese people have always held high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism and engaged in a head-on struggle against imperialism and revisionism. Today, China is a strong pillar and fortress for all Marxist-Leninist revolutionary forces in the world, for the international communist movement, and for the people of all countries who are fighting for socialism. All genuine Marxist-Leninist forces and progressive peoples who stand on the side of the proletarian revolution have unlimited respect and love for the Chinese people and Chairman Mao.

Shambuli, in talking about the Chinese people's great criticism of the top capitalist-roader within the Party, said, the "Reminiscences" of the top capitalist-roader within the Chinese Communist Party is a fraud, and this book is preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. If the top capitalist-roader within the Party usurps the leadership, China will become like the Soviet Union today, and the world revolution will be set back hundreds of years.

Shambuli said, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people are advancing courageously on the road of revolution. After the Albanian Labor Party took a series of revolutionary measures, the country has seen an unprecedented good situation, and a thorough ideological and cultural revolution is being carried out. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Chinese people and the Albanian people are firmly marching on the socialist road, making great contributions, and supporting and assisting the struggle of the people of all countries in the world for liberation.

The Chinese Trade Union delegation, led by Zhao Guoqing, Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, arrived in Fier District on the morning of May 3 for a friendly visit.

    文化大革命是毛主席对马列主义的伟大发展
    阿劳动党中央委员沙姆布利指出：中国党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的《修养》是欺人之谈，是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的
    新华社地拉那七日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、劳动党发罗拉区委员会第一书记佩·沙姆布利，三日在发罗拉区工会举行的欢迎中国工会代表团的宴会上，热情地指出：我们的时代有了毛主席，这是全世界人民莫大的幸运。
    沙姆布利说，目前正在中国深入开展的无产阶级文化大革命具有极其伟大的意义。无产阶级文化大革命的胜利开展，不仅关系到中国人民的命运，而且关系到全世界人民的命运。通过这场大革命，打倒了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，堵塞了产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的孔道。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的重要意义在于，毛泽东同志进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，在实践中解决了如何防止资本主义复辟、保卫革命胜利果实的问题。
    沙姆布利赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命是在伟大的马克思列宁主义的毛泽东思想的基础上进行的。在这场革命中贯彻执行了毛主席所制定的群众路线。全中国人民都投入了这场革命，并且在革命中显示了自己的巨大力量。
    沙姆布利说，美帝国主义和现代修正主义对中国的无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死。它们的害怕和恐惧再次证明了中国的无产阶级文化大革命的重要性，证明了毛主席的论断：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。
    他说，我们感到十分高兴的是，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，在各个方面取得了辉煌的胜利。中国不仅地大物博，人口众多，而且有着伟大的马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想。我们的时代，有了毛主席，这是全世界人民的莫大幸运。我们祝中国人民和全世界无产阶级的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的朋友毛泽东同志万寿无疆。
    沙姆布利还说，以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党和伟大的中国人民始终高举马克思列宁主义的革命旗帜，同帝国主义、修正主义进行针锋相对的斗争。今天，中国是世界上所有马克思列宁主义革命力量、国际共产主义运动、为社会主义而斗争的各国人民的强大支柱和堡垒。真正站在无产阶级革命立场上的马克思列宁主义力量和进步人民，都对中国人民、对毛主席无限敬仰和无限热爱。
    沙姆布利在谈到中国人民对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判时说，中国共产党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》是欺人之谈，这本书是为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的。如果让党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派篡夺了领导权，中国就会变成今天的苏联，世界革命就要倒退数百年。
  沙姆布利说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在霍查同志的英明领导下，正在革命化道路上奋勇前进。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党采取了一系列革命化措施后，全国出现了一派史无前例的大好形势，正在深入开展思想文化革命。中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民在毛主席和霍查同志的领导下，坚定地走在社会主义的道路上，正在做出重大的贡献，支持和援助全世界各国人民争取解放的斗争。
    由中华全国总工会书记处书记赵国强率领的中国工会代表团，是在三日上午到达发罗拉区进行友好访问的。
