The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has sounded the death knell for the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within our school. In the early stages of the movement, they colluded with the working groups controlled by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee to vigorously promote the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing and striking down revolutionary masses, while in personnel matters, they engaged in the despicable act of "striking down a large group, protecting a small group."

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party ruthlessly strike down revolutionary cadres, attempting to muddy the waters to escape.

Not long after the start of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the drive of the proletarian revolutionary masses, batches of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary teachers in our school broke through the net of revisionism and came out to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. This revolutionary action terrified the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. They feared that if revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses united, they would thoroughly expose their crimes. Thus, they colluded with the working groups controlled by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Provincial Party Committee to launch a frenzied counterattack, setting up one "tightening spell" after another, doing everything possible to obstruct revolutionary cadres from rebelling.

First, they proclaimed: "There is a difference between insiders and outsiders." They widely propagated the slave ideology in "Cultivation" to restrain the revolutionary actions of cadres. When revolutionary cadres saw through their plot and stood up to expose their crimes, they threatened viciously, "Revolution and counter-revolution are only a step or half a step apart. Don't think you are great." They also slandered revolutionary cadres as "monsters and demons who jumped out themselves," "fake leftists, true rightists," "individualists with personal ambitions."

Second, they proclaimed: "Those with bad backgrounds are not allowed to rebel." They used files and conservative organizations to maliciously throw out so-called investigations into the backgrounds and class status of cadres, going to great lengths to distort right and wrong, attempting to create the illusion that the revolutionary cadres who stood up to rebel were "bastards," "political opportunists," while the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party who were exposed were "old revolutionaries," "people with merits," and "consistent leftists."

Third, they proclaimed: "Cadres who have made mistakes in the past are not allowed to rebel." At the beginning of the movement, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party threatened some Party Committee members, saying, "Your problem is serious; you are on the edge of the black line and need to examine yourself carefully." When these cadres began to expose problems under the drive of the revolutionary youngsters, they immediately spread the rumor, "These people have many problems; they are rebelling to fish in troubled waters, to grab a straw," and ordered the confiscation of the notebooks of these cadres, collecting materials on these cadres. They also deliberately exposed a cadre with historical problems, attempting to divert people's attention and confuse the direction of the struggle.

Fourth, they proclaimed: "The motive for rebellion is impure." For cadres who had no problems in history and whose performance was relatively good, they fabricated accusations that these comrades had impure motives for rebelling, aiming to strike down revolutionary cadres.

When their obstruction failed, they deceived and incited the masses who did not understand the truth, and using their authority, they organized through the organizational system, layer by layer, to arrange for thousands of big-character posters to attack revolutionary cadres who dared to expose the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. They secretly arranged for people to follow, tail, and monitor revolutionary cadres, turning their every word and deed into materials, subjecting them to various forms of political persecution.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party also colluded with the working groups, proposing to "expose whatever problems there are" and to "sweep clean," and saying, "Sweeping clean is not just one sweep, but to sweep over and over again." They incited students to expose teachers and student cadres, engaging in a thorough investigation, making cadres and teachers feel threatened, carrying burdens, and unable to focus on exposing the problems of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Taking the Academic Affairs Office as an example, a single unit "swept clean" thirty-seven people, with seventeen labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," accounting for seventy percent of the total. A worker who opposed their methods and raised a point of criticism was immediately removed from his position as production group leader and labeled as a "monster and demon."

At that time, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, sitting and watching the struggle, said with satisfaction, "I have been liberated half-way!" "In another month, I will be liberated." Some bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" who had been beaten down by the Red Guards also boasted, "Now I have companions!"

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, blinded by their greed, thought they had succeeded, and thus actively convened meetings of representatives of teachers and staff, striving to set the tone and sing praises for themselves, portraying themselves as good cadres. At the meeting, only praise for this small group was allowed, and criticism was not permitted. When the revolutionary youngsters from the Water Conservancy Department stood up to sharply expose the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, they hurriedly mobilized forces to suppress the revolutionary youngsters and forced them to make self-criticisms.

Chairman Mao said, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party's "striking down a large group, protecting a small group" in personnel matters is entirely to muddy the waters, strike down revolutionary cadres, obstruct the combination of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, and make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fail halfway, in order to maintain their shaky revisionist rule.

The proletarian revolutionary masses resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy and engage in a head-on struggle with the bourgeois reactionary line.

The proletarian revolutionary masses take Chairman Mao's words to heart and follow them to the letter. The revolutionary masses believe: "Our country is a proletarian dictatorship, and fundamentally, the proletariat is in power. In the Party, government, and military departments, and in the industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and military sectors, the cadres responsible for various levels of leadership work, in general situations, the majority support the Party and Chairman Mao, and resolutely follow the socialist path." "The handful of anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the leadership positions of the Party and the state are only a small group." Therefore, when revolutionary students launched a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, they resolutely resisted the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group, protecting a small group" and actively supported revolutionary cadres to rebel.

After the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within our Party were exposed, the proletarian revolutionary masses immediately convened a cadre meeting, mobilizing revolutionary cadres to expose the crimes of this small group of people.

When revolutionary cadres posted big-character posters exposing the crimes, the revolutionary masses visited them, had heart-to-heart talks, and presented them with "Quotations from Chairman Mao," warmly welcoming the revolutionary actions of the cadres.

When revolutionary cadres were struck down by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, the revolutionary youngsters, risking being labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and "royalists," firmly supported them. When a revolutionary cadre was under attack, the revolutionary youngsters, based on a large amount of investigation materials, insisted on principles and fought side by side with him.

Through arduous struggles, the proletarian revolutionary masses in our school resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, successfully achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and established the revolutionary committee, seizing all power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party.

In summary, in dealing with cadre issues, the proletarian revolutionary masses and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are completely different and clearly distinct. We advocate "uniting the majority, striking down a small group," while they advocate "striking down a large group, protecting a small group." This is a head-on struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line.

Now, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are trying to pin the crime of "overthrowing all cadres" on the proletarian revolutionary masses and the proletarian headquarters. They are colluding with some people who do not understand the truth, sowing discord between cadres and revolutionary youngsters, and between cadres and the proletarian headquarters. This is a big plot that must be thoroughly exposed.

In fact, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party have not yet abandoned their wolfish ambition of "striking down a large group, protecting a small group." They are not gone but are spreading various rumors, directing their arrows at the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ, saying, "The three-in-one combination is a hodgepodge," "The big power is still unknown to whom." They are also inciting some people who do not understand the truth to attack revolutionary cadres. The proletarian revolutionary masses must not be complacent and must resolutely give them a head-on blow.

Therefore, in criticizing the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, we must focus on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group, protecting a small group" in cadre issues, eliminating its poison, and liberating cadres who have been deceived and struck down by the bourgeois reactionary line.

    是谁“打击一大片，保护一小撮”？
    是谁“团结大多数，打击一小撮”？
    山东工学院革命委员会换新天战斗队
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，敲响了我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丧钟。他们为了挽救自己垂死的命运，在运动初期，伙同前山东省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所操纵的工作组，极力推行资产阶级反动路线，压制和打击革命群众，同时在干部问题上大搞“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的卑鄙勾当。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对革命干部横加打击，企图把水搅浑，以便他们逃之夭夭
    无产阶级文化大革命开始不久，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，在无产阶级革命派推动下，我院一批批革命干部、革命教师，冲决了修正主义的罗网，杀了出来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。这种革命行动，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派吓破了胆。他们很害怕革命干部和革命群众一旦联合起来，就会彻底揭露他们的罪行。于是，他们伙同前省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所控制的工作组进行疯狂反扑，设下了一道一道的“紧箍咒”，千方百计地阻挠革命干部造反。
    一曰：“内外有别”。他们大肆宣传《修养》中的奴隶主义来约束革命干部的革命行动。当革命干部识破了他们的阴谋，并站出来揭发他们的罪行时，他们又恶狠狠地威胁说：“革命和反革命只是一步、半步之差，不要以为自己了不起。”并污蔑革命干部是“自己跳出来的牛鬼蛇神”、“假左派，真右派”、“个人野心家”。
    二曰：“出身不好的不许造反”。他们动用档案，通过保守派组织，别有用心地抛出了所谓干部出身、成份情况调查，极尽颠倒黑白之能事，企图造成一种假象，似乎站出来造反的革命干部是“狗崽子”、“政治投机分子”，而被揭发出来的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派则是“老革命”、“有功劳”、“一贯是左派”。
    三曰：“过去犯有错误的干部不许造反”。运动一开始，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就威胁一些党委委员说：“你的问题很严重，是黑线的边缘，要好好检查。”这些干部在革命小将的推动下，开始起来揭发问题时，他们马上放风说，“这些人问题很多，造反是想混水摸鱼，想捞稻草”，并下令没收这几个干部的笔记本，搜集这几个干部的材料。他们还故意抛出一个有历史问题的干部，企图转移人们的视线，混淆斗争的大方向。
    四曰：“造反动机不纯”。对于在历史上查不出什么问题，表现又较好的革命干部，他们就无中生有地攻击这些同志造反动机不纯，是想“抢个官做”等等，企图打击革命干部。
    阻挠不成，他们就蒙蔽和挑动不明真相的群众，并利用职权，通过组织系统，层层布置，组织了成千张大字报，围攻敢于揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派罪行的革命干部。他们暗中布置人对革命干部进行跟踪、盯梢、监视，把这些同志的一言一行都整成材料，对他们进行种种政治迫害。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派还和工作组一唱一和，提出“有什么问题就揭什么问题”，要“横扫”，并且说什么“横扫就不是扫一次，而是要翻来复去地扫”。他们挑动学生去揭发教师和学生干部，大搞人人过关，弄得干部、教师人人自危，背上包袱，没有心思去揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的问题。以教务处为例，一个单位就“横扫”三十七人，被打成“反革命”的有十七人，占总人数的百分之七十。有一个工人反对他们这种做法，提了一点意见，马上被撤销生产组长职务，并被打成“牛鬼蛇神”。
    当时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派“坐山观虎斗”，欣然自得地说：“我解放了一半啦！”“再过一个月，我就解放了。”被红卫兵小将打得威风扫地的一些资产阶级反动学术“权威”，也得意洋洋地说：“有了做伴的人了！”
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派利令智昏，自以为得计，于是积极召开了什么师生员工代表会议，极力为他们自己定调子、唱赞歌，把自己打扮成好干部。在会议上，只许说这一小撮人好，不许说这一小撮人坏。当水利系革命小将站出来尖锐地揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行时，他们就慌忙调动力量，逼迫干部去围剿革命小将，并强迫革命小将检讨错误。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，完全是为了把水搅浑，打击革命干部，阻挠革命干部和革命群众相结合，使无产阶级文化大革命半途夭折，以维持其摇摇欲坠的修正主义统治。
    无产阶级革命派坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，同资产阶级反动路线进行针锋相对的斗争
    无产阶级革命派对于毛主席的话，句句都听，句句照办。革命群众相信：“我们的国家是无产阶级专政的国家，从根本上说来，当权的是无产阶级。在党、政、军各部门，在工、农、商、学、兵各界里负责各级领导工作的干部，在一般情况下，大多数是拥护党，拥护毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路的。”“钻到党和国家领导岗位的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的反革命修正主义分子，只是一小撮。”因此，革命学生在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的时候，坚决抵制了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，积极支持革命干部起来革命。
    当我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派被揪出来以后，无产阶级革命派即召开了干部会议，发动革命干部起来揭发那一小撮人的罪行。
    当革命干部贴出了揭发的大字报时，革命派就登门访问，与他们促膝谈心，向他们赠送《毛主席语录》，以满腔热情欢迎干部的革命行动。
    当革命干部遭受一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打击的时候，革命小将冒着被打成“反革命”、“保皇派”的危险，坚决支持他们。一位革命干部遭受围攻时，革命小将根据调查的大量材料，坚持原则，和他并肩战斗。
    我院无产阶级革命派经过了艰苦的斗争，坚决地执行毛主席的干部政策，胜利地实现了革命的“三结合”，成立了革命委员会，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手中夺回了一切大权。
    总之，在对待干部问题上，无产阶级革命派和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是截然不同、泾渭分明的。我们要“团结大多数，打击一小撮”，他们却要“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的针锋相对的斗争。
    现在，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派企图把对干部“打倒一切”的罪名，强加在无产阶级革命派头上，强加在无产阶级司令部头上。他们拉拢一些不明真相的人，挑拨干部同革命小将的关系，挑拨干部和无产阶级司令部的关系。这是一个大阴谋，必须彻底揭穿。
    事实上，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派至今仍未放弃其“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的狼子野心。他们阴魂不散，制造种种流言蜚语，把矛头指向革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，说什么“三结合是大杂烩”，“大权还不知落在谁手中”。他们还在挑动一些不明真相的人去围攻革命干部，无产阶级革命派对此切切不可掉以轻心，必须坚决给予迎头痛击。
    因此，当前在批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的时候，必须着重批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，肃清其流毒，解放受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽和打击的干部。
