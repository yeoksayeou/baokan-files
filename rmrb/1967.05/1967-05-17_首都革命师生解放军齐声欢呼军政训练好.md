Mao Zedong's brilliant directives have added new and important content to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities. Revolutionary teachers and students in the capital, along with the PLA, enthusiastically hail the success of military and political training.

Revolutionary teachers and students at Beijing Normal University said: The publication of the editorial "Military and Political Training is Excellent" is the greatest concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for us. We must learn more humbly from the PLA, adhere to the correct direction of struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

According to Xinhua News Agency, on the 16th, revolutionary teachers and students from colleges and universities in the capital, along with PLA officers and soldiers conducting military and political training in the schools, enthusiastically hailed the publication of the editorial "Military and Political Training is Excellent" in the People's Daily. They said that this editorial conveys Chairman Mao's brilliant directives on military and political training, which is the greatest concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for us revolutionary teachers and students, and the greatest trust in the PLA. This editorial expresses our innermost thoughts and our common aspirations. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, work closely together, unite as one, and better complete this glorious task of military and political training, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the schools through to the end!

Revolutionary teachers and students from colleges and universities in the capital, along with PLA officers and soldiers participating in military and political training, were overjoyed and excited after reading Chairman Mao's new directives on military and political training. They spread the news, wrote big-character posters, and held meetings, repeatedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They said that these brilliant directives have added new and important content to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities nationwide, marking another great achievement in the revolution, with great strategic significance. Many schools beat drums and gongs, taking to the streets to report the good news to the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the headquarters of the garrison troops in Beijing, and other units.

At various meetings, revolutionary teachers and students undergoing military and political training enthusiastically praised, "Military and political training is excellent, very excellent!" They excitedly said, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Training makes a big difference compared to no training." Military and political training has further enhanced the revolutionary teachers and students' awareness of studying, applying, and using Chairman Mao's works, igniting their boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao; at the same time, it has greatly promoted the school's revolutionary criticism, struggle, and transformation, making revolutionary teachers and students stand more firmly on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, enhancing their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and effectively promoting the school's revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. In early March, Shijingshan Middle School conducted military and political training. With the help of the PLA, all revolutionary teachers and students united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. Currently, this school has been in session for over a month, with teachers and students showing a completely new spirit. The fervor of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is surging, and a new school spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness is taking shape. Today, the revolutionary teachers and students of this school unanimously praised at a symposium, "The PLA has brought us Mao Zedong Thought, and military and political training is excellent!" With the help of the PLA, through military and political training, the revolutionary teachers and students of the 89th Middle School, who have achieved great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination based on teaching classes, excitedly compared the situation before and after the school's military and political training, unanimously saying that these achievements were made because Chairman Mao sent the PLA to help us with military and political training. As long as we act according to Chairman Mao's teachings, we will definitely make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the school even better.

Today, tens of thousands of revolutionary teachers and students in the capital enthusiastically praised the new achievements made by the Beijing Garrison Command and the garrison troops in Beijing during military and political training, praising their unwavering loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, trusting and relying on the masses, and their clear stance and firm position. Revolutionary teachers and students excitedly said: The PLA, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly adheres to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, always puts proletarian politics first, cares about what we care about, thinks about what we think about, helps with what we need, and always fights alongside us, achieving victory together. They are truly the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao, directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, and the firm pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students of Baiwanzhuang Middle School deeply felt that without the PLA helping us with military and political training, our school's revolutionary leftists would not have been able to quickly achieve great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. They expressed their determination to seriously learn from the PLA, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two lines, cultivate the great spirit of the proletariat that can only liberate all mankind to finally liberate itself, mobilize the surging Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution army, and with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," complete the great tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation. An Lin, a member of the revolutionary committee and teacher of the 91st Middle School in Beijing, excitedly said: In military and political training, we learned politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eighths style, the three major disciplines and eight points for attention from the PLA, strengthened organizational discipline, thoroughly criticized small-groupism, individualism, and other non-proletarian thoughts, and promoted ideological revolutionization.

Since January, the officers and soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Command and the garrison troops in Beijing have successively gone to colleges and universities in the capital to help revolutionary teachers and students with military and political training, achieving remarkable results. Today, the officers and soldiers studied Chairman Mao's brilliant directives on military and political training and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, build on achievements, overcome shortcomings, humbly learn from revolutionary teachers and students, and work together with the broad revolutionary teachers and students to further improve military and political training and complete the glorious task entrusted by Chairman Mao. PLA officers and soldiers participating in military and political training in various middle schools in Haidian District today repeatedly studied the editorial in the People's Daily and the experience of Beijing Normal University conducting military and political training. A model soldier from a certain unit, Qin Yufeng, expressed his determination to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly stand with the revolutionary leftists, humbly learn from the revolutionary youngsters, take the struggle between the two lines as the key, and do a better job in military and political training.

According to Xinhua News Agency, today, the campus of Beijing Normal University is filled with the enthusiastic atmosphere of the people supporting the army and the army loving the people. Revolutionary teachers and students joyfully shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They said that this is the greatest concern of our great leader Chairman Mao for the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University. They expressed their determination not to disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to learn more humbly from the PLA, to adhere to the correct direction of struggle, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrade Tan Houlan, a leader of the Jinggangshan Commune at Beijing Normal University, said that after the PLA comrades came to Beijing Normal University, they truly held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly implemented the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and resolutely supported the revolutionary leftists, doing a lot of work. In the face of intense struggles, they took a clear stance and resolutely supported the Jinggangshan Commune, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionary forces. The comrades from the troops also paid special attention to emphasizing proletarian politics, vigorously promoting the study of Chairman Mao's works, helping us establish a new academic style, cultivating the habit of studying Chairman Mao's works, and improving the level of struggle of our proletarian revolutionary forces. Comrade Tan Houlan said that the revolutionary situation at Beijing Normal University is now very good. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, not be complacent about our achievements, but learn more from the PLA, further achieve revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, and prepare for a new high tide of criticism, struggle, and transformation. We will not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations.

Li Qinglin, a leader of the Jinggangshan Rebel Corps, who was originally opposed to the Jinggangshan Commune, wrote an article to the Jinggangshan Radio Station of Beijing Normal University after listening to the broadcast today, expressing his gratitude to the PLA for saving him with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. After the PLA entered the school, Deputy Political Commissar Li Tonghe had several heart-to-heart talks with him, explaining the situation of class struggle, the principle of breaking "private" to establish "public," and helping him with the two remembrances (remembering class bitterness and the bitterness of being persecuted by the reactionary bourgeois line) and three examinations (examining stance, work, and fighting spirit). He did in-depth and detailed ideological work, gradually awakening him. Li Qinglin said, "Just as I was walking further and further down the wrong path, the PLA comrades used Mao Zedong Thought to enlighten and educate me, helping me return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line from the wrong path. I will shout 'Long live Chairman Mao!' a thousand times, ten thousand times! I will definitely follow your words, use your brilliant thoughts to arm my mind, and be your good student."

The entire team of radar soldiers of the Jinggangshan Commune's Lei Dabao Combat Group believes that learning from the PLA is most importantly learning from the PLA's practice of putting studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a higher, greater, earlier, and more important position, always acting according to Mao Zedong Thought; learning from the PLA's spirit of self-revolution, fighting the "private" character in one's mind; learning from the PLA's high organizational discipline, fighting and opposing anarchism, defending proletarian organizational discipline, and learning from the PLA's humble and cautious excellent style.

The revolutionary teachers and students of this school expressed their determination to do military and political training better in the future, resolutely execute the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, learn politics, military affairs, the four firsts, the three-eighths style, the three major disciplines and eight points for attention from the PLA, strengthen organizational discipline, and turn Beijing Normal University into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    首都革命师生解放军齐声欢呼军政训练好
    北师大革命师生说：《军政训练好》社论的发表，是伟大领袖毛主席对我们的最大关怀。我们一定更加虚心地向解放军学习，坚持斗争大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    据新华社十六日讯　首都大中学校的广大革命师生和在学校进行军政训练的人民解放军指战员，热烈欢呼《人民日报》社论《军政训练好》的发表。他们说，这篇社论给我们传达了毛主席关于军政训练的英明指示，这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们革命师生的最大关怀，是对人民解放军的最大信任。这篇社论说出了我们的心里话，表达了我们的共同心愿。我们一定坚决响应毛主席的拥军爱民的伟大号召，密切合作，团结一致，更好地完成军政训练这个光荣任务，把学校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    首都大中学校广大革命师生和参加军政训练的解放军指战员，看了伟大领袖毛主席关于军政训练的新指示后，欢欣鼓舞，奔走相告，纷纷写大字报、举行集会，一次又一次地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”他们说，这些英明指示，给全国大中学校的无产阶级文化大革命增加了新的重要内容，是无产阶级文化大革命又一伟大创举，具有伟大的战略意义。许多学校师生敲锣打鼓，走上街头，到中央文革、驻京部队领导机关等单位报喜。
    在各种集会上，正在进行军政训练的广大革命师生，用自己的亲身感受热烈称赞：“军政训练就是好，好得很！”他们激动地说，正如伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“训练一下和不训练大不一样。”军政训练进一步增强了革命师生活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性，激发了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情；同时，大大推动了学校的革命大批判、大斗争，使革命师生更加坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，增强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，有力地促进了学校的革命大联合和革命的“三结合”。石景山中学三月初进行了军政训练，在解放军的帮助下，全校革命师生在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。目前这个学校已经复课一个多月了，师生精神面貌焕然一新，活学活用毛主席著作形成热潮，团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的革命新校风正在形成。今天，这个学校的革命师生在座谈会上，一致赞扬说：“解放军给我们带来了毛泽东思想，军政训练好得很！”在解放军帮助下，通过军政训练，实现了以教学班为基础的全校大联合和革命“三结合”的八十九中革命师生，怀着兴奋的心情，对比学校军政训练前后情况，异口同声地说，这些成绩的取得，就是因为毛主席派解放军帮助我们进行了军政训练，只要我们按照毛主席的教导办事，就一定能把学校的无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。
    今天，首都成千上万的革命师生，热烈赞扬北京卫戍区和驻京部队指战员在军政训练中创建的新功勋，赞扬他们无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，相信群众、依靠群众、旗帜鲜明、立场坚定。革命师生激动地说：人民解放军在军政训练中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，处处突出无产阶级政治，急我们所急，想我们所想，帮我们所需，始终和我们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，不愧为毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林彪同志直接指挥的人民军队，不愧为无产阶级文化大革命的坚强柱石。百万庄中学革命师生，深有感触地说，没有解放军帮助我们进行军政训练，我校无产阶级革命派就不可能迅速实现革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”。他们表示，一定要认真向解放军学习，在两条路线斗争中，进一步活学活用毛主席著作，树立无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的伟大胸怀，调动起浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，胜利完成一斗二批三改的伟大任务。北京九十一中革命委员会委员、教师安宏林兴奋地说：我们在军政训练中，向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性，大破小团体主义、风头主义、个人主义等非无产阶级思想，促进了思想革命化。
    北京卫戍区部队和驻京部队广大指战员从一月份起，陆续到首都大中学校帮助革命师生进行军政训练，取得显著成绩。今天，指战员们学习了毛主席关于军政训练的英明指示，他们表示坚决遵照毛主席的教导，发扬成绩，克服缺点，虚心向革命师生学习，和广大革命师生一道，进一步搞好军政训练，完成毛主席交给的光荣任务。正在海淀区各中学参加军政训练的解放军干部战士，今天都反复学习了《人民日报》社论和北京师范大学进行军政训练的经验。某部五好战士秦岳峰表示，要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，坚决和革命左派站在一起，虚心向革命小将学习，以两条路线斗争为纲，把军政训练工作做得好上加好。
    据新华社十六日讯　今天，北京师范大学的校园里洋溢着民拥军、军爱民的热烈气氛，广大革命师生纵情欢呼《人民日报》社论《军政训练好》和《在北师大搞军训的部队是如何支持左派的？》一文的发表。他们热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁、万万岁！”他们说，这是伟大领袖毛主席对北师大革命师生的最大关怀。他们表示，一定不辜负毛主席的期望，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更加虚心地向人民解放军学习，坚持斗争的大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北师大井冈山公社的负责人谭厚兰同志说，解放军同志来到北师大以后，真正高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚决支持革命左派，做了许多工作。在斗争十分尖锐的情况下，他们旗帜鲜明，坚决支持井冈山公社，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气。部队同志还特别注意突出无产阶级政治，狠抓毛主席著作的学习，帮助我们树立了新的学风，养成了学习毛主席著作的习惯，提高了我们这支无产阶级革命派队伍的斗争水平。谭厚兰同志说，现在我们北师大的革命形势很好，我们一定遵循毛主席的教导，决不因取得一点成绩就骄傲起来，而要进一步向解放军学习，进一步实现以教学班为基础的革命的大联合，为大批判、大斗争，掀起斗批改的新高潮准备条件。我们决不辜负毛主席的期望。
    原来和井冈山公社对立的井冈山造反兵团负责人李庆林，今天听了广播后，怀着万分激动的心情给北师大井冈山广播台写了文章，感谢解放军用战无不胜的毛泽东思想挽救了他。解放军进校后，副政委李同贺曾经多次找他谈心，给他讲阶级斗争的形势，讲破
  “私”立“公”的道理，帮助他进行两忆（忆阶级苦、忆受资产阶级反动路线迫害的苦）三查（查立场、查工作、查斗志）。对他做了深入细致的思想工作，使他逐渐清醒过来。李庆林说：“正当我在错误的道路上越走越远的时候，解放军同志用毛泽东思想启发教育我，使我从错误的道路上回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，我要一千遍一万遍地高呼：‘毛主席万岁！’我一定听您老人家的话，用您的光辉思想武装头脑，做您的好学生。”
    井冈山公社雷达兵战斗组的全体战士认为，学习解放军，最重要的是学习解放军把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，时时处处按毛泽东思想办事；学习解放军自我革命的精神，狠斗头脑中的“私”字；学习解放军高度的组织纪律性，大反特反无政府主义，捍卫无产阶级组织纪律性，学习解放军谦虚谨慎的优良作风。
    这个学校的广大革命师生表示，今后要把军政训练搞得更好，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席的指示，向解放军学政治，学军事，学四个第一，学三八作风，学三大纪律八项注意，加强组织纪律性，把北京师范大学办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
