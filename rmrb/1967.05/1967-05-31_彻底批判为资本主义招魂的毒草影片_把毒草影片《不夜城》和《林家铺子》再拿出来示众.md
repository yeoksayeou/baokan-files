The class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat ultimately comes down to the question of power. The proletariat must consolidate its power, while the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow it. This is the life-and-death struggle between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the restoration of capitalism.

The history of the past seventeen years since the founding of the nation shows that the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the representative of the bourgeoisie's attempt to seize power from the proletariat. He is China's Khrushchev.

After the decisive victory of the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial enterprises in China, two films that fervently praised the bourgeoisie and summoned capitalism, "Never-Night City" and "Lin's Shop," were produced in 1957 and 1958. These two poisonous weeds were created according to the counter-revolutionary intentions of China's Khrushchev. They are the products of the anti-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, such as Zhou Yang and Xia Yan, who, under the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, launched a mad attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat and a major counterattack against the surging socialist revolutionary tide.

In 1965, Comrade Jiang Qing, following the instructions of Chairman Mao, ordered the old Propaganda Department, headed by the devilish Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang, to bring out a batch of poisonous films, including these two, for criticism. However, Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, and others, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, played a trick of hypocrisy, conducting a fake criticism and openly resisting Chairman Mao's instructions, leading a serious political struggle into the bourgeois "pure academic" discussion of the wrong path.

Debts must be repaid. In the midst of our mass criticism of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and a small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, we must bring out these two poisonous films again for public display. We must criticize the poison they spread, the counter-revolutionary "theories" on which the films were based, and the masterminds behind the fake criticism, and thoroughly expose and denounce them all!

I

After the Chinese people overthrew the "three big mountains," should we head towards capitalism and implement bourgeois dictatorship, or towards socialism and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat? This is the struggle that determines the fate and future of China. China's Khrushchev is an old opportunist. After the founding of the nation, he proposed the reactionary program of "consolidating the new democratic order," raving madly about the so-called "progressiveness" of capitalism, advocating "exploitation is meritorious," and shouting "we must develop capitalist exploitation." He even called out to the capitalist bosses: "Today, capitalism in China is in its youth, playing its historical role, its active role, and building its merits. You should hurry up and make efforts, do not miss the opportunity." His goal was to develop capitalism in China.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Only socialism can save China." Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, we insisted on the socialist revolutionary road, gradually realized the socialist transformation of capitalist and commercial enterprises, and shattered the capitalist bosses' and their number one agent within the Party's beautiful dream. However, they were not willing to see the collapse of their "ideals" and harbored deep resentment towards the socialist transformation. It was at this time that the films "Never-Night City" and "Lin's Shop" were produced. They loudly advocated "exploitation is meritorious," maliciously distorted history, and sang praises to the bourgeoisie, lamenting their sufferings and merits, and complaining about the fact that the bourgeoisie bosses did not implement bourgeois dictatorship. They wrote "indictments" for the bourgeoisie undergoing socialist transformation, venting their hatred towards the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The first half of "Never-Night City" and "Lin's Shop" depict events from the democratic revolution period. However, both films erased the history of the Chinese working class and laboring people, led by the Party, using armed struggle to defeat the three enemies and achieve victory. Instead, they dressed up the bourgeoisie as the masters of the times and the heroes who saved the nation.

In the small town depicted in "Lin's Shop," people from all classes relied on "Lin Yuan Ji": "Orphans and widows" depended on "Lin Yuan Ji" for their livelihood; farmer Lao Tongbao chanted "Amitabha" to the boss Lin; shop employees and workers completely entrusted their fate to the boss. When the shop's business was booming, they celebrated together with the boss; when the shop faced difficulties, they offered strategies to the boss. In the end, when "Lin Yuan Ji" collapsed in the face of "countless hardships," the entire small town seemed to collapse like the end of the world. The film painted a tragic picture of the capitalist's bankruptcy.

The creators of "Never-Night City" blatantly portrayed the capitalists as heroes who created national industries to save China. From the old capitalist Liang Puquan and Zhang Yaotang to their "successors" Zhang Bohan, they risked sailing in the "black sea" to compete with foreigners, "tasting all kinds of bitterness and sweetness," and finally built a "self-producing and self-selling" factory. The two films, one eulogizing the unsuccessful capitalists and the other singing praises to the greater capitalists who "saved the nation," from different angles, advocated the social ideals of the bourgeoisie: Under the rule of the "three big enemies" in old China, those who persisted in struggle were not others but this group of bloodthirsty capitalists; only by "developing capitalist exploitation" in China and implementing bourgeois dictatorship could China have a way out.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of ownership in our country, these counter-revolutionary revisionists conducted such counter-revolutionary propaganda, openly challenging the dictatorship of the proletariat.

What "heroes who saved the nation"! What "merits" of the bourgeoisie? Where is the "nation" they "saved"? It was our great leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, and the heroic proletariat and broad masses of laboring people led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, who liberated China from the oppression of the "three big mountains." During the most difficult period of the Chinese revolution after 1927, where did the Chinese national bourgeoisie go? It betrayed the revolution and became a accomplice of the counter-revolution! Such a weak, wavering, and compromising national bourgeoisie could save China? Could they save China by setting up a few small factories? However, during the socialist revolutionary period, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and their literary lackeys wanted to elevate such a bourgeoisie to "heroes," cry "unjust" for their transformation and elimination, and attempt to let them seize the victory fruits of the proletariat and laboring people, throwing the proletariat and laboring people back into the abyss of suffering, and letting the bourgeoisie rule the world. This is intolerable!

What "exploitation is meritorious"! Marx pointed out long ago: "Capital comes into the world, from head to toe, every pore dripping with blood and filth." I ask, did the Chinese bourgeoisie not fatten themselves by sucking the blood and sweat of the laboring people? Is Chinese history really upside down, where the bourgeoisie fed the laboring people, and the laboring people should beg them for a living? No! This is the cannibalistic philosophy of the bourgeoisie! If we follow this philosophy, Chinese history will regress, and the working class and laboring people will suffer!

II

The proletariat must eliminate the bourgeoisie, eliminate the capitalist system, and realize the ideal of communism, inevitably facing strong resistance from the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the proletariat must never forget the question of power and must greatly strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, carrying out socialist revolutions on the economic, political, and ideological and cultural fronts. As Lenin said: "The resistance of the bourgeoisie, because it has been overthrown (even if only in one country), becomes ten times more ferocious." He also said: "The development towards communism must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot take any other path, because there is no other person and no other path that can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalist."

Our country's socialist transformation itself is a very sharp and complex class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, in the film "Never-Night City," the sharp and complex class struggle is completely erased, and the capitalists not only show no resistance to the socialist revolution but also willingly accept the socialist transformation. Look, the big capitalists like Zhang Bohan, after the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," actually put on a show and said: "We are also entering socialism."

How did the big capitalists like Zhang Bohan "enter socialism"? The film tells us: First, he remembered the "bitterness and sweetness" of the past, so he "loved" socialism; second, he wanted to make production "catch up with the needs of national construction," and public-private cooperation could "improve equipment" and increase productivity; third, due to the "persuasion" of his wife and the "encouragement" of his daughter, he decided to throw away the "stinky name of the exploiting class" and become a "self-reliant laborer"; fourth, the "reformation" of the working class with "repaying kindness with kindness" made him decide to give up his factory... Here, the film completely erases the class essence of the bourgeoisie's opposition to the socialist revolution, erases the life-and-death class struggle during the socialist revolutionary period, and erases the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat. What is even more intolerable is that the film, through the mouths of the industrial department head of the district committee, Qu Haisheng, and the secretary of the youth league, Lin Yan, loudly proclaims: "Bringing the capitalists into socialism." The so-called "bringing the capitalists into socialism" is the "peaceful entry into socialism," which is the old clichés of counter-revolutionary revisionism. This tune comes directly from the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

It is this person who has been shouting at the top of his lungs: "We must peacefully transform into socialism"; it is he who has told the capitalists: "As long as we cooperate now, we can peacefully enter socialism in the future"; it is he who has strongly advocated letting the capitalists "enter socialism" with "smiling faces." In his eyes, the capitalists are so "wise" that with just a "change of heart," they can "become Buddhas instantly," changing their reactionary stance; as long as the capitalists think the Communist Party is more capable, they will give up their ambition to seize China like the bearded guest seeing Li Shimin, "giving up the idea of seizing the throne of China." The counter-revolutionary revisionists like Xia Yan understand their master's teachings very well, and it is according to this set of fallacies that they created the poisonous weeds. Xia Yan once said: His purpose in rewriting "Lin's Shop" was to let the bourgeoisie "compare the past and present" and "remember bitterness and sweetness." It is said that: As long as the bourgeoisie think about the past and look at the present, they can "unconsciously board the big ship of socialism"...

What "remembering bitterness and sweetness"! What "comparing the past and present"! Would the capitalists regard their exploitative lives as "bitter"? Would they regard the socialist revolution that eliminates exploitation as "sweet"? Would they "compare the past and present" and come to the conclusion that "socialism is good," thereby "voluntarily taking the socialist road"? All of these are lies! The reason the bourgeoisie is the bourgeoisie is that they want to develop capitalism, and their class nature is to oppose the socialist revolution. To let the capitalists "compare the past and present" can only make the capitalists the more they "compare," the more they long for capitalism, the more they hate socialism; the more they "compare," the more they want to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism.

In fact, throughout the entire process of our country's socialist revolution, from the struggle of "restriction and counter-restriction," the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis," the anti-rightist struggle, to today, the bourgeoisie has always stubbornly demanded the development of capitalism and the capitalist road, and they are not willing to give up their "paradise." It is only because the proletariat has a powerful state machine and the great power of the dictatorship of the proletariat, constantly fighting against the bourgeoisie and making them bleed, that they are forced to accept the socialist transformation in the face of the inevitable trend, and they have never voluntarily taken the socialist road.

In a word, the film advocates that capitalists can "voluntarily" accept socialist transformation and "peacefully enter socialism," which is to cover up the reactionary nature of the bourgeoisie on the one hand, to dull the revolutionary will of the working class, making the proletariat abandon class struggle and the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat; on the other hand, to incite the bourgeoisie to seize power from the proletariat, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restore capitalism.

This is the most vicious political trick played by the creators of the film and their backers.

Don't believe it? Look, that China's Khrushchev, while singing the tune of "peaceful entry into socialism," secretly instructs the capitalists: "You must struggle with the workers, if you don't struggle, when your factory is fought down by the workers, then you can't blame the Communist Party." What a wolf in sheep's clothing, revealing his ferocious intentions, what a good running dog of the capitalists!

III

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most treacherous and vicious trick of the bourgeoisie to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration is to use the method of pulling out and pushing in, cultivating their protectors and agents within the working class, and carrying out peaceful evolution on the dictatorship of the proletariat.

For a long time, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, in order to realize his counter-revolutionary restoration plot, has been recruiting soldiers and buying horses, forming cliques, and gathering ghosts and snakes, assembling a group of big and small lackeys. Once the time is ripe, they will usurp the Party, usurp the government, and usurp the military.

"Never-Night City" and "Lin's Shop" advocate the fallacy of "peaceful entry into socialism" on the one hand, and on the other hand, they sing praises to two traitors of the working class as heroes, which is completely in the service of the counter-revolutionary purposes of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party.

In "Lin's Shop," Shou Sheng is a thorough traitor. Although he is a shop employee and worker in name, he is willing to be loyal to the capitalists. He loves what the bourgeoisie loves, hates what the bourgeoisie hates, likes what the bourgeoisie likes, and worries about what the bourgeoisie worries about. What he thinks about and does day and night is to help the capitalists "develop capitalist exploitation." In the end, he becomes the "son-in-law of the dragon" of the Lin family and the young boss of "Lin Yuan Ji." The film praises such a traitor and lets people learn from him and imitate him. How poisonous his intentions are!

In "Never-Night City," the industrial department head of the district committee, Qu Haisheng, is an even more thorough class surrenderist. When Zhang Bohan and his gang were celebrating their "golden age" of great potential, Qu Haisheng preached to the workers: "The Party's policy is to bring them into socialism." When the workers, with class hatred, wanted to struggle against the lawless capitalists, he scolded the workers: "You are a worker, your mind cannot be so narrow, otherwise, you will make mistakes!" Because Zhang Bohan pursued profits and forced Yin Di to conduct high-speed trial operation on old machinery, causing a serious industrial accident, Qu Haisheng comforted Zhang Bohan: "The working class does not hold grudges..."

What "mind cannot be narrow"! What "does not hold grudges"! This is the thorough traitor's tune! Should the workers not struggle when the capitalists spread poison and launch a fierce attack on socialism? Should the workers not resist and revolt when the capitalists cruelly exploit and persecute the workers? What kind of logic is this "revolt is unreasonable"? If we follow Qu Haisheng's teachings, it is to make the working class forget class bitterness, forget blood hatred, and let the capitalists butcher them; it is to make the working class abandon class struggle and surrender to the bourgeoisie.

However, the film praises such a traitor and claims that his every word and deed is the "Party's policy," and his traitorous behavior is "building socialism." Nonsense! When did our Party have such a surrender policy? This class surrender policy is purely the black goods of the bourgeoisie headquarters. It is precisely the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party who openly proposed to "let the proletariat inherit the bourgeoisie's legacy," treat the capitalists as "treasures," and let the proletariat regard the capitalists as "masters"; it is he who repeatedly went to Tianjin to advise the big bloodsucker Song Qinqing and suppress the workers' revolution; it is he who strongly advocated that the working class should "abandon personal grudges" and adopt an attitude of "forgetting the past, forgiving, enduring, and being tolerant" towards the capitalists, making the proletariat cancel the dictatorship of the proletariat.

I ask, can a person like Qu Haisheng, who implements the bourgeoisie's policies of the bourgeoisie headquarters, build socialism? Absolutely not. Look at the scene in the film "Never-Night City" where Qu Haisheng organized the celebration of the "construction of socialism"!

Here: The capitalists who have "merits in exploitation" are laughing with bloodstained mouths; the bourgeoisie's masters and mistresses are wearing "masks" and dancing in "joy"; red and green neon lights are "entertaining" them, and colorful fireworks are "showing off" for them, the entire city is celebrating for this group of capitalists. The sky belongs to the capitalists; the earth belongs to the capitalists.

This is the "socialism" that the film praises and that China's Khrushchev longs for! There is no dictatorship of the proletariat here, only the joy of the capitalists. And the history of class struggle tells us that when the capitalists are joyful, it is the day the proletariat suffers. The film lets those fat and greedy capitalists dance wildly, demonstrating arrogantly to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and they actually say this is "socialism"! No, this is an outright restoration of capitalism! This is a thorough bourgeois dictatorship!

Chairman Mao has often taught us in recent years: The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, the restoration of capitalism may be imminent at any time. This means: Throughout the entire socialist period, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, are irreconcilable. If the bourgeoisie's restoration plot is not thoroughly smashed, the proletariat will lose its power, and thousands and tens of thousands of people will lose their heads.

We must raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, expose all the counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the military, and various cultural circles, and let them perish in the raging flames of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat!

    彻底批判为资本主义招魂的毒草影片
    ——把毒草影片《不夜城》和《林家铺子》再拿出来示众
    魏任民
    无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题。无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，资产阶级要推翻这个政权。这是无产阶级专政同资本主义复辟的殊死搏斗。
    建国十七年来的历史表明，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是资产阶级向无产阶级反夺权的总代表，他就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    当我国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造刚刚取得决定性胜利之后，在一九五七年到一九五八年相继出笼的两部狂热地歌颂资产阶级、为资本主义招魂的毒草影片《不夜城》和《林家铺子》，就是按照中国的赫鲁晓夫的反革命意旨炮制出来的两株大毒草。这是文艺界的反革命修正主义分子周扬、夏衍之流在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，向无产阶级专政发动的一次疯狂的大进攻，是对汹涌澎湃的社会主义革命潮流的大反扑。
    一九六五年，江青同志根据毛主席的指示，要旧中宣部的阎王陆定一、周扬把包括这两部在内的一批毒草影片拿出来批判。可是，彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵等人，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，玩弄阳奉阴违、明批暗保的大骗局，搞了一场假批判，公开抗拒毛主席的指示，把一场严重的政治斗争引入资产阶级“纯学术”讨论的邪路。
    欠账是必须偿还的。在我们向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以及一小撮反革命修正主义分子展开群众性的大批判的高潮中，必须把这两部毒草影片再次拿出来示众，把它们散布的毒素，把制作影片所依据的那套反革命“理论”，连同那场假批判的幕后导演者，统统批倒批臭！
    一
    中国人民推翻“三座大山”以后，是走向资本主义，实行资产阶级专政，还是走向社会主义，实行无产阶级专政？这是决定中国命运和前途的斗争。中国的赫鲁晓夫是老牌的机会主义者。建国以后，他提出“巩固新民主主义秩序”的反动纲领，如癫似狂地宣扬资本主义的所谓“进步性”，鼓吹“剥削有功”，高喊“要发展资本主义剥削”；他甚至向资本家老爷们号召说：“今天中国资本主义是在青年时代，正在发挥他的历史作用，积极作用，建立功劳的时候，（你们）应赶紧努力，不要错过。”他的目的就是一个：要在中国发展资本主义。
    毛主席指出：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。在毛主席的亲自领导下，我们坚持了社会主义革命的道路，逐步实现了对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，粉碎了资产阶级老爷们以及他们在党内的头号代理人的黄粱美梦。可是，他们并不甘心自己“理想”的破灭，他们对社会主义改造怀恨于心。就在这时，影片《不夜城》和《林家铺子》出笼了。它们大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”，恶意篡改历史，为资产阶级鸣冤诉苦、歌功颂德，为未能实行资产阶级专政的资产阶级老爷们鸣不平，为正在经受社会主义改造的资产阶级写“冤状”，对着无产阶级专政发泄他们的满腔仇恨。
    《不夜城》的前半部和《林家铺子》，写的都是民主革命时期的事情。但是，两部影片却一笔抹去了党领导下的中国工人阶级和劳动人民用武装斗争打垮三大敌人的革命和胜利的历史，反而把资产阶级打扮成时代的主宰和救国的功臣。
    在《林家铺子》描写的那个小镇上，各个阶层的人们都仰仗“林源记”：“孤儿寡妇”靠着“林源记”维持生计；农民老通宝朝着林老板高念“阿弥陀佛”；店员工人更把自己的命运完全寄托在老板身上。商店买卖兴隆，他们就同老板一起共庆发财；商店遭难，他们就为老板出谋划策。最后，“林源记”在“重重苦难”中倒台，整个小镇就象“末日来临”似的崩溃了。影片为资本家的破产描绘了一幅悲剧图景。
    《不夜城》的炮制者们，赤裸裸地把资本家打扮成创办民族工业以救中国的英雄。从老资本家梁溥泉、张耀堂，到他们的“接替人”张伯韩，为了“跟外国人竞争”，冒着“黑海洋里行船”的危险，“尝尽了各种酸甜苦辣”，终于干出了一个“自产自销”的工厂。两部影片，一个为发家不成的资本家念悼词，一个为“救国有功”的更大的资本家唱颂歌。它们从不同的角度，宣扬资产阶级的社会理想：在“三大敌人”统治下的旧中国，一直坚持奋斗的，不是别人，就是这群嗜血成性的资本家；只有在中国“发展资本主义剥削”，实行资产阶级专政，中国才有出路。
    当我国社会主义改造在所有制方面基本完成以后，这些反革命修正主义分子进行这种反革命宣传，就是明目张胆地向无产阶级专政进行反攻倒算。
    什么“救国功臣”！资产阶级的“功”在哪里？他们“救”的“国”又在何方？把中国从“三座大山”的重压下解放出来的，是我们伟大的领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，是伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党，是毛主席和共产党领导下的英雄的无产阶级和广大劳动人民，是毛主席和共产党领导的伟大的人民战争。在一九二七年以后中国革命最艰苦的一段岁月里，中国民族资产阶级跑到哪儿去了？它倒向了革命的敌人，成了反革命的帮凶！就是这样一个软弱的、动摇的、妥协的民族资产阶级，能够救中国吗？凭着他们办几个小小的工厂就能救中国吗？但是，在社会主义革命时期，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以及他们的御用文人们，却想把这样的资产阶级捧成“英雄”，为它的被改造被消灭喊“冤”，妄图让它夺取无产阶级和劳动人民的胜利果实，把无产阶级和劳动人民重新置于苦难的深渊，让资产阶级去坐天下，是可忍，孰不可忍？
    什么“剥削有功”！马克思早就指出：“资本来到世间，就是从头到脚，每个毛孔都滴着血和肮脏的东西。”请问，中国的资产阶级难道不是靠吸劳动人民的血，喝劳动人民的汗，喂肥自己的身躯吗？难道中国的历史竟是颠倒的，是资产阶级养活了劳动人民，劳动人民应该向他们乞讨过活吗？不！这是资产阶级老爷们的吃人哲学！如果依了这套哲学，中国历史就要倒退，工人阶级和劳动人民就要遭殃！
    二
    无产阶级要消灭资产阶级，消灭资本主义制度，实现共产主义的理想，必然会遭到资产阶级的强烈反抗。因此，无产阶级时刻也不能忘记政权，必须大大加强无产阶级专政，进行经济、政治、思想文化战线上的社会主义革命。正如列宁所说：“资产阶级的反抗，因为自己被推翻（哪怕是在一个国家内）而凶猛十倍。”他又说：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”
    我国社会主义改造本身，就是无产阶级同资产阶级之间一场十分尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。但是，在影片《不夜城》里，尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争被涂抹得干干净净，资本家不仅对社会主义革命没有些许反抗，而且自觉自愿地接受了社会主义改造。请看，大资本家张伯韩之流，在三反、五反之后，居然装模作样地说：我们也要进入社会主义了。
    大资本家张伯韩之流，究竟是怎样“进入社会主义”的呢？影片告诉人们说：一是他想起“尝尽了各种酸甜苦辣”的过去，于是，就“爱”上了社会主义；二是他要使生产“赶上国家建设的需要”，公私合营可以“改进设备”，提高生产力；三是由于老婆的“规劝”和女儿的“鼓励”，他就决心扔掉“剥削阶级的臭名声”，要做“自食其力的劳动者”；四是工人阶级“以德报怨”之类的“感化”，使他决心放弃自己的工厂……在这里，影片完全抹杀了资产阶级反对社会主义革命的阶级本质，抹杀了社会主义革命时期你死我活的阶级斗争，抹杀了无产阶级专政的必要性。更令人不能容忍的是，影片通过区委工业部长瞿海生和团支部书记林琰之口大肆喧嚷：把资本家带进社会主义。所谓“把资本家带进社会主义”，就是“和平长入社会主义”，这是反革命修正主义的陈词滥调。这个调子正是来自党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。
    就是这个人，曾经声嘶力竭地叫喊：“要和平地转变到社会主义”；就是他，曾经对资本家说：“只要我们现在的合作搞下去，将来是可以和平进入社会主义的”；就是他，极力主张要让资本家“眉开眼笑”地“进入社会主义”。在这个人看来，资本家是那样的“明智”，只要“一念之差”，就能“立地成佛”，改变反动立场；只要资本家觉得共产党比他高明，他就会象虬髯客看见李世民那样，“便打消了夺取中国天下的念头”，“不做皇帝了”。反革命修正主义分子夏衍等人对他们主子的教义是心领神会的，夏衍之流正是按照这套谬论炮制毒草的。夏衍曾经说过：他改编《林家铺子》的目的，是为了让资产阶级“今昔对比”、“忆苦思甜”。据说：资产阶级只要想想过去，看看今天，就可以“在不知不觉中走上社会主义的大船”。……
    什么“忆苦思甜”！什么“今昔对比”！难道资本家会把他们的剥削生活看成“苦”？难道他们会把消灭剥削的社会主义革命看成“甜”？难道他们“今昔对比”就能比出一个“社会主义好”来，从而“自觉走上社会主义道路”吗？所有这些，统统都是骗人的鬼话！资产阶级之所以为资产阶级，就是因为他们要发展资本主义，他们的阶级本性，就是反对社会主义革命。要资本家“今昔对比”，只能使资本家越“对比”越向往资本主义，仇恨社会主义；越“对比”越要推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    事实上，在我国社会主义革命的整个过程中，从“限制反限制”的斗争，“三反”、“五反”，反右派斗争，直到今天，资产阶级一直是顽固地要求发展资本主义，走资本主义道路的，他们决不甘心失去自己的“天堂”。只是因为无产阶级有强大的国家机器，有无产阶级专政的巨大威力，不断地同资产阶级进行斗争，打得他们头破血流，才使他们在大势所趋的情况下，不得不被迫接受社会主义改造，他们从来就没有自觉自愿地走社会主义道路。
    一句话，影片鼓吹资本家能够“自觉”接受社会主义改造，能够“和平长入社会主义”，就是一方面掩盖资产阶级的反动本质，麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，使无产阶级放弃阶级斗争，放弃巩固无产阶级专政；另一方面煽动资产阶级向无产阶级夺权，推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。
    这是影片的炮制者及其幕后支持者们玩弄的最恶毒的政治骗局。
    不信吗？请看，那个中国的赫鲁晓夫一面高唱“和平长入社会主义”的滥调，一面在对资本家密授“军机”：“你们必须要和工人斗争，如果不斗，将来你的厂子被工人斗垮了台，那时，你就不能怪共产党不好。”真是狼子野心，凶相毕露，好一个资本家的乏走狗！
    三
    在无产阶级专政的条件下，资产阶级为了颠覆无产阶级专政，实行反革命复辟，最阴险最狠毒的一手，就是用拉出去、打进来的办法，在工人阶级队伍内部培植他们的保护人和代理人，对无产阶级专政进行和平演变。
    长期以来，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为了实现其反革命复辟的阴谋，到处招兵买马，结党营私，网罗牛鬼蛇神，拼凑了一群大大小小的娄罗。一旦时机成熟，他们就要篡党、篡政、篡军。
    《不夜城》和《林家铺子》一面鼓吹“和平长入社会主义”的谬论，一面又把两个工人阶级的叛徒当作英雄人物大加歌颂，这完全是为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命目的服务的。
    《林家铺子》里的寿生，是一个地地道道的工贼。他名为店员工人，却心甘情愿地为资本家效忠。他爱资产阶级之所爱，恨资产阶级之所恨，喜资产阶级之所喜，忧资产阶级之所忧。他心里想的，日夜干的，就是帮助资本家“发展资本主义剥削”。最后，他就变成了林府的“乘龙快婿”，“林源记”的少老板。影片对这样一个工贼却大加赞赏，让人们去学习他，仿效他。其用心何其毒也！
    《不夜城》中的区委工业部长瞿海生，更是一个阶级投降主义者。当张伯韩一伙正在为他们“大有可为”的“黄金时代”举杯欢庆的时候，瞿海生却对工人宣传说：“党的政策是：把他们带进社会主义”。工人怀着阶级仇恨要斗争不法资本家，他却斥责工人说：
  “你是工人，胸襟不能这么窄，不然你就要犯错误！”由于张伯韩追求利润，强令银娣在旧机器上进行加速运转试验，造成严重工伤事故，瞿海生却安慰张伯韩说：“工人阶级是不记私仇的……。”
    什么“胸襟不能窄”！什么“不记私仇”！这是十足的叛徒腔！难道资本家大肆放毒，向社会主义猖狂进攻，工人不应该进行斗争吗？难道资本家残酷剥削、迫害工人，工人不应该反抗，不应该造反吗？这个“造反无理”的谬论，究竟是哪家逻辑！按照瞿海生的说教去做，就是要工人阶级忘记阶级苦，忘记血泪仇，听任资本家宰割；就是要工人阶级放弃阶级斗争，向资产阶级屈膝投降。
    然而，影片却对这样一个叛徒大加歌颂，硬说他的一言一行，就是“党的政策”，他的叛徒行径，就是在搞“社会主义”。胡说！我们党什么时候有这种投降政策？这种阶级投降政策纯粹是资产阶级司令部的黑货。正是那个党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，公然提出要“无产阶级接收资产阶级遗产”，把资本家当“宝贝”，要无产阶级拜资本家为“师傅”；正是他，三番五次跑到天津，向大吸血鬼宋棐卿献计献策，压制工人革命；正是他，大力宣扬工人阶级要“抛弃私人仇怨”，对资本家采取“既往不咎”、“原谅”、“忍耐”、“宽恕”的态度，让无产阶级取消无产阶级专政。
    请问，象瞿海生这种执行资产阶级司令部的资产阶级政策的人，能够搞社会主义吗？绝对不能。请看影片《不夜城》里那个由瞿海生搞起来的欢庆“社会主义”建成的场面吧！
    在这里：“剥削有功”的资本家，正咧着血盆大口狞笑；资产阶级的老爷太太们戴着“假面具”在“男欢女喜”地狂舞；红红绿绿的霓虹灯为他们“助兴”，五彩缤纷的烟火在为他们“扬威”，整个城市都在为这群资本家“欢庆”。天，是资本家的天；地，是资本家的地。
    这就是影片所歌颂的那个中国的赫鲁晓夫所期待的“社会主义”！这里没有无产阶级专政，有的只是资本家的欢乐。而阶级斗争的历史告诉我们，资本家欢乐之时，就是无产阶级遭殃之日。影片让那些脑满肠肥的资本家群魔乱舞，向无产阶级专政狂妄示威，他们竟然说这是什么“社会主义”！不，这是不折不扣的资本主义复辟！这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级专政！
    毛主席最近几年经常教导我们：革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。这就是说：在整个社会主义时期，无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争，是不可调和的。不把资产阶级的复辟阴谋彻底粉碎，无产阶级就会丧失自己的政权，就会千百万人头落地。
    我们要高高举起革命的批判旗帜，把混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的反革命修正主义分子统统揪出来，让他们在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火之中死无葬身之地！
