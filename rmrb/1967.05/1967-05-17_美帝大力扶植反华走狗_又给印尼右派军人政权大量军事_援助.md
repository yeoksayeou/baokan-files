The U.S. imperialists, in order to tighten their support for the Indonesian reactionaries as tools for anti-China activities and aggression in Southeast Asia, are providing large amounts of military aid to the Indonesian right-wing military regime and training Indonesian right-wing troops.

According to a report from Western news agencies in Washington, a U.S. State Department official revealed on the 5th that, based on the "military aid agreement" secretly signed in Jakarta in April with the Indonesian right-wing military regime, the U.S. is providing nearly two million dollars worth of free military aid to the Indonesian right-wing troops. According to the "agreement," the U.S. will supply machinery and parts for the military construction units of the Indonesian right-wing, and will also provide other equipment urgently needed by the Indonesian right-wing troops. To meet the "urgent needs" of the Indonesian right-wing troops, U.S. Air Force transport planes have already delivered a batch of military supplies to Jakarta on April 25.

At the same time, according to recent reports from Western news agencies in Jakarta, the U.S. has been training Indonesian right-wing troops since last autumn. The report states: "For the past six months, the U.S. has quietly carried out a military training program involving all Indonesian armed forces. Last autumn, a small group of Indonesian military personnel went to the U.S. for training... more Indonesian military personnel will go to the U.S. for training in the near future." The news also revealed that a military delegation consisting of 35 American military experts had been active in Jakarta since early April.

The U.S. imperialists orchestrated the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique to stage a counter-revolutionary coup in Indonesia and seize state power precisely to use the Indonesian reactionaries as their tools of aggression. After the right-wing military clique came to power, the U.S. has been continuously supporting this reactionary regime through economic and military "aid."

    美帝大力扶植反华走狗
    又给印尼右派军人政权大量军事“援助”
    新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义为了加紧扶植印度尼西亚反动派充当反华和侵略东南亚的工具，正向印尼右派军人政权提供大量军事援助，训练印尼右派军队。
    据西方通讯社从华盛顿报道，美国国务院官员五日透露，美国根据在四月间同印尼右派军人政权在雅加达秘密签订的“军事援助协定”，向印尼右派军队提供的无偿军事援助价值近两百万美元。根据“协定”，美国将为印尼右派的军事建筑组供应机械装备和零件，还将提供印尼右派军队所急需的其它装备。为了应付印尼右派军队的“紧急需要”，美国空军运输机已经在四月二十五日向雅加达运交了一批军事物资。
    与此同时，据西方通讯社最近从雅加达报道，美国从去年秋季以来就在训练印尼右派军队。报道说：“六个月来美国静悄悄地进行一项涉及印尼所有武装部队的军事训练计划。去年秋天已经有一小批印尼军人到美国受训……，更多的印尼军人将在不久的将来到美国受训。”消息还透露，一个由三十五名美国军事专家组成的军事代表团，曾经在四月初到雅加达进行活动。
    美帝国主义策动苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团在印尼发动反革命政变夺取国家政权就是为了利用印尼反动派充当它的侵略工具。在右派军人集团上台后，美国一直通过经济和军事“援助”来扶植这个反动政权。
