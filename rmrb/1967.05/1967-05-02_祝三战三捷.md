Just as the whole nation is celebrating the Day of Solidarity of the World's Proletariat and Working People, our Southwest frontline air force units have brought us another thrilling victory report. Our heroic air force units in a certain place in Guangxi shot down two U.S. A-4B attack planes that had intruded into our airspace to provoke.

This is the third major victory in eight days for our air force units, which have shot down five U.S. aggressor planes in a row. It fully demonstrates the invincible might of the Chinese People's Liberation Army armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong. It is another heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, which is expanding its aggression in Vietnam and plotting new war adventures in Southeast Asia.

We cheer for the air force units' consecutive victories!

We salute the brave air force units!

U.S. imperialism, disregarding the stern warnings of our people, has recently sent planes into our airspace time and again to deliberately provoke military incidents, attempting to gain something from the Chinese people who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Since the U.S. air pirates are so shamelessly insisting on coming to our door, the great Chinese people will of course give them a special welcome, show them our colors, and give them a good beating!

At present, U.S. imperialism is pinning its hopes on continuously "escalating" the war to salvage its defeat in South Vietnam. They, instigated by the Soviet revisionists, are trying to force the Vietnamese people to surrender with bombs. But the bombs of the U.S. aggressors can neither frighten the heroic Vietnamese people nor shake the firm will of the great Chinese people to aid Vietnam and resist the U.S.

We once again warn U.S. imperialism: the 700 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are invincible. If the U.S. air pirates dare to intrude into our airspace again, they will surely meet a bad end. The iron fists of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are always ready to deal with the U.S. aggressors. If they come, we will hit them hard! If they dare to come, we will make sure they come to no good end!

    祝三战三捷

    正当举国欢庆全世界无产阶级和劳动人民团结战斗节日的时候，我西南前哨空军部队，又传来了令人振奋的捷报。英雄的空军部队在广西某地上空，一举击落侵入我国领空进行挑衅的美国A—4B型攻击机两架。
    这是我空军部队在八天内取得的连续击落美国强盗飞机五架的第三次大捷。它充分显示了用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民解放军的无比威力。它是对正在扩大侵越战争和阴谋在东南亚进行新的战争冒险的美帝国主义的又一次沉重打击。
    我们为空军部队连战连捷欢呼！
    我们向英勇的空军部队致敬！
    美帝国主义不顾我国人民的严厉警告，不甘心于它遭到的失败，最近，一而再再而三地派飞机侵入我国领空，蓄意进行军事挑衅，妄想从正在进行无产阶级文化大革命的中国人民这里捞点什么油水。美国空中强盗既然这样死皮赖脸地硬要送上门来，伟大的中国人民当然就要毫不含糊地给予特殊的接待，给它点颜色看，打它个倒栽葱，打它个稀巴烂！
    目前，美帝国主义正把挽救它在南越败局的希望，放在不断战争“升级”上。他们在苏修的怂恿下，妄想用炸弹来迫使越南人民投降。但是，美国强盗的炸弹既吓不倒英雄的越南人民，也绝对动摇不了伟大的中国人民援越抗美的坚强意志。
    我们再一次正告美帝国主义，七亿中国人民和中国人民解放军是无敌于天下的。美国空中强盗胆敢继续侵犯我国领空，一定没有好下场。中国人民和中国人民解放军的铁拳，随时都等待着美国侵略强盗。来了就打，狠狠地打！只要它敢来，管叫它有来无回！
