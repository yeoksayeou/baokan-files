Chairman Mao, like the sun, shines wherever he goes. With the red sun in our hearts, we have a direction for struggle and power for revolution.

The seas are churning with clouds and waves, and the continents are shaking with thunder and lightning. Great Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of struggle for all oppressed peoples of the world.

In South Vietnam, the battlefield stretches for thousands of miles. The heroic people swear to annihilate the stubborn enemy. Who brought the powerful ideological weapon? It is you, beloved Chairman Mao! Look at the aggressors, they are trapped in the vast ocean of people's war, with no end in sight. To deal with American imperialism, we must learn from Yu Gong: "Unshakable, dig the mountain every day without stopping." The struggle will definitely be victorious.

Look up and see the Big Dipper. The Big Dipper is Mao Zedong. Follow your words, keep them in our hearts; read your books, never relax. Follow Mao Zedong, and the world will be red.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is like thunder and storm. It shakes the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. We must learn from the Chinese Red Guards and vow to be the vanguard of the revolution. Salute! To the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong.

Great Mao Zedong, you trust the masses the most; the people are the real heroes. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China uproots thousands of roots of revisionism, shatters the dream of capitalist restoration, and ensures that the socialist mountains remain red for thousands of generations... Let us shout enthusiastically: "Long live! Long live! Mao Zedong!"

Mao Zedong—you are the wise helmsman, guiding us forward; you are the beacon, shining brightly.

You teach us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." You bring us wisdom, strength, and courage. We must take up the gun, strongly oppose imperialism, and strongly oppose colonialism. We must drive away the dark clouds and let the earth see a new day and month.

    毛主席世界人民热爱您
    ——在京外国朋友参观“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”影展（图片）
    毛主席，象太阳，照到那里那里亮。心中有了红太阳，斗争有方向，革命有力量。
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。伟大的毛泽东思想，给全世界被压迫人民照亮了战斗的道路。
    越南南方，战火千里。英雄人民，誓歼顽敌。是谁送来强大思想武器？是您，敬爱的毛主席！且看侵略者，陷入人民战争汪洋大海，无边无底。对付美帝，要学愚公：“毫不动摇，每天挖山不止。”斗争一定胜利。
    抬头望见北斗星。北斗星就是毛泽东。听您的话，牢记在心中；读您的书，一刻不放松。跟着毛泽东，世界一片红。
    文化大革命，是春雷，是暴风。它震撼了亿万人的心灵。我们要学中国的红小兵，誓当革命先锋。敬礼！中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东。
    伟大的毛泽东，最相信群众；人民群众，是真正的英雄。中国无产阶级文化大革命，拔掉修正主义千条根，打破资本主义复辟梦，使社会主义江山，千秋万代红彤彤……让我们尽情高呼：“万岁！万岁！毛泽东！”
    毛泽东——您是英明的舵手，指引我们向前；你是指路明灯，金光闪闪。
    您教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。您给我们送来智慧、力量和勇敢。我们要拿起枪杆，大造帝国主义的反，大造殖民主义的反。我们要把乌云驱散，让大地日月换新天。
