A Nigerian friend recently wrote a poem, passionately praising the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong. In the poem, he wrote:

	Mao Zedong is the red sun,
	Mao Zedong Thought is the sunlight;
	A red sun rises from China,
	This red sun is Mao Zedong;
	The sunlight shines everywhere, inspiring all oppressed peoples,
	This sunlight is Mao Zedong Thought.
	This red sun does not belong to China alone,
	This sunlight does not belong to the Chinese people alone,
	But it is the red beacon for all oppressed peoples of the world.
	The spark that ignited the Chinese revolution,
	Now blazes across the entire world,
	Mao Zedong Thought has spread throughout the world.
	Mao Zedong has brought happiness to the working people.
	Year after year, I long to see you!
	Though mountains and rivers stand in the way,
	My heart has already flown to you.
	I long to receive your teachings,
	I long to rush to your side,
	To drink deeply of your wisdom,
	To become your loyal little student.
	Your thoughts are evergreen,
	Your works are boundless.
	Mao Zedong, the great revolutionary giant,
	You have smashed Khrushchev's schemes,
	And made the U.S. imperialists tremble.
	Let me come to your embrace,
	To receive the nurturing of your thoughts' sunlight,
	Then return to Africa,
	To propagate your thoughts' truth,
	To spread your revolutionary truth.
	For the working people,
	I will dedicate myself to the struggle.

    毛泽东是红太阳
    一位尼日利亚朋友不久前写了一首诗，热情颂扬世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席。他在诗中写道：
    毛泽东是红太阳，
    毛泽东思想是阳光；
    一轮红日从中国升起，
    这轮红日就是毛泽东；
    阳光普照，激励着一切被压迫人民，
    这阳光就是毛泽东思想。
    这红日不仅属于中国，
    这阳光也不仅属于中国人民，
    而且是世界被压迫人民的红色指路明灯。
    那点燃中国革命的星星之火，
    如今正在全世界燎原，
    毛泽东思想已经传遍全世界。
    毛泽东给劳动人民带来了幸福。
    一年复一年，我多么渴望见到您呀！
    虽然关山阻隔，
    但我的心却早已飞向远方。
    我多么渴望得到您的教益，
    多么渴望能奔到您的身旁，
    畅饮您智慧的甘露，
    成为您忠诚的小学生。
    您的思想万古长青，
    您的著作宏伟无边。
    毛泽东，伟大的革命巨人，
    您把赫鲁晓夫的阴谋粉碎，
    也把美帝吓得浑身发抖。
    让我投到您的怀抱，
    承受您思想的阳光的抚育，
    然后返回非洲，
    为您的思想的真理去宣传，
    为您的革命的真理去传播。
    为劳动人民，
    我要投身于战斗。
