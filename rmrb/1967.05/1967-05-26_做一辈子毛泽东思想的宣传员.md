Mao Zedong's letter "After Watching 'Forced into Rebellion' Written to the Yan'an Drama Troupe" has been published, and we are extremely pleased to see it. This letter of great significance has pointed out the direction for us, workers in Peking Opera. We must perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers, making the heroes of the working class the permanent masters of the Peking Opera stage.

To "turn the history that has been turned upside down back to its right side," this is the brilliant direction indicated by Chairman Mao for revolutionary literary and artistic workers. Since liberation, due to the fact that a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party have usurped the leadership of the literary and artistic circles, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art has not only not been implemented, but on the contrary, plays that propagate feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism have been widely performed. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and those under their patronage and support, such as Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Qi Yan Ming, and Xia Yan, have used these vicious means to turn literature and art into their frontline position for restoring capitalism.

Under the control of counter-revolutionary revisionists, we young actors of the China Peking Opera Troupe have been poisoned quite a bit. We all studied in drama schools after liberation, but what we learned were plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. After graduation, what we performed were still plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. Whether it was Mu Guiying, Lin Manganzi, Zhao Wunü, or feudal princes like Gao Chong, landlord tyrants like Gao Deng, and those like Zhao Yun who loyally served the feudal emperors, they were all dead people, ancient people, emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties. What was most infuriating was that during the three years of economic difficulties, we performed "Describing the Journey" at a military support and veteran care evening event. In this play, Zhao Wunü, abandoned by the slave of the feudal ruling class, Cai Boji, sings,
"Our home is out of rice and out of grain,
Why haven't you returned from your journey to the capital?"
She talks about how her parents-in-law starved to death, and how she has no money to travel to the capital to find her husband... What a
"pitiful, miserable, and sad" scene! At that time, we performed this bad play in front of the great People's Liberation Army and their families, and we couldn't even lift our heads on stage.

In 1964, the national Peking Opera modern revolutionary drama performance competition blew the trumpet for the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and revolutionary Peking Opera workers were all elated. To better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we all volunteered to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the fiery struggles. However, the revisionist leaders in the literary and artistic circles, led by Zhou Yang, relying on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party as their backing, strongly resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art and spared no effort to sabotage the Peking Opera revolution. In the second half of 1964, we went to the troops with great enthusiasm, determined to stay in the troops for a longer period and learn well from the PLA. Unexpectedly, after only six days in the troops, we were called back to Beijing and continued to perform plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties in the theaters in Beijing. However, this intolerable phenomenon was only the desperate struggle of the decaying forces. Under the brilliant illumination of the great thought of Mao Zedong, and under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, the Peking Opera revolution finally won, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art was thoroughly bankrupt. For centuries, the stage dominated by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties has undergone a thorough change. The old masters and madams, young masters and misses have been cleaned out as historical dregs, and the people have become the true masters and shown their prowess. Facing this great situation, how can revolutionary Peking Opera workers, young actors of the socialist era, not raise their arms and shout long live the great thought of Mao Zedong! Our hearts' reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, long live, ten thousand times long live!

Great teacher, great leader, great commander, great helmsman Chairman Mao, as we celebrate this great victory, we must remember your teachings and firmly grasp the class struggle as the key link, and seize back the leadership of the literary and artistic circles, and all the leadership usurped by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, into the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and forever firmly and unshakably use revolutionary literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve proletarian politics, and be lifelong promoters of Mao Zedong Thought!

    做一辈子毛泽东思想的宣传员
    中国京剧院  杨秋玲  俞大陆
    毛主席在《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》公开发表了，我们看了万分高兴。这封具有伟大意义的信件，给我们京剧工作者指出了方向。我们一定要演工农兵，使工农兵的英雄人物永远成为京剧舞台上的主人。
    把舞台上“颠倒的历史再颠倒过来”，这是毛主席给革命文艺工作者所指示的光辉方向。解放以来，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派窃踞了文艺界的领导权，毛主席的革命文艺路线不但没有得到贯彻执行，相反，宣传封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的毒草戏却大量上演。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，彭真反革命修正主义集团，以及在他们包庇和支持下的周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍等一伙，正是用这种毒辣的手段，把文艺当作他们复辟资本主义的前哨阵地。
    在反革命修正主义分子把持下，我们中国京剧院的青年演员，中了不少毒。我们都是解放以后到戏曲学校学习的，但是，我们所学的，是表现帝王将相、才子佳人的戏；我们毕业后所演的，还是帝王将相、才子佳人。什么穆桂英呀，林娘子呀，赵五娘呀，什么封建王爷高宠、地主恶霸高登，以及为封建帝王忠心耿耿服务的赵云啦，统统是死人、古人、帝王将相、才子佳人。最令人气愤的是在三年经济困难时期，我们在一次拥军优属的晚会上，竟演出了《描容上路》这出戏。在这个戏里，被封建统治阶级的奴才蔡伯喈遗弃的赵五娘，口口声声唱着
  “家中断米又断粮”，“你上京怎么还不回转”，又是公婆饿死了，又是上京寻夫没有盘缠……好一幅
  “凄凄惨惨戚戚”景象！当时，我们在伟大的中国人民解放军和他们的家属面前演这个坏戏，自己在台上都感到抬不起头来。
    一九六四年，全国京剧革命现代戏会演，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的进军号，革命的京剧工作者无不欢欣鼓舞。为了更好地为工农兵服务，我们纷纷要求遵照毛主席的指示，到工农兵中去，到火热的斗争中去。但是，以周扬为首的文艺界修正主义头头们，仗着有党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派作后台，对毛主席的革命文艺路线百般抵制，挖空心思地破坏京剧革命。一九六四年下半年，我们兴高采烈地到部队去，决心在部队里多呆一个时期，好好向解放军学习。不料我们刚到部队六天，就被叫回北京，在北京的剧院里继续演帝王将相、才子佳人戏。但是，这种令人不能容忍的现象，只不过是腐朽力量的垂死挣扎。在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在江青同志的指导下，京剧革命终于胜利了，反革命修正主义文艺路线彻底破产了。多少世纪来，被帝王将相、才子佳人统治的戏剧舞台，起了天翻地覆的变化。老爷太太少爷小姐们作为历史的渣滓被清除出去，人民群众成为真正的主人而大显身手。面对这大好形势，革命的京剧工作者，社会主义时代的青年演员，怎能不振臂高呼伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁，万万岁！
    伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席，当我们欢庆这伟大胜利的时候，我们一定要牢记您的教导，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，把文艺界的领导权，把一切被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃踞的领导权，统统夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远坚定不移地用革命的文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，做一辈子毛泽东思想的宣传员！
