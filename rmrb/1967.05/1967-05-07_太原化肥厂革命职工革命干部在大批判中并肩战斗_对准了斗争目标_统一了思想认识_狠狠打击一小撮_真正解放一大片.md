Revolutionary workers and cadres of the Taiyuan Fertilizer Factory fight side by side in the struggle. They have focused on the targets of the struggle, unified their ideological understanding, struck hard at a handful of elements, and truly liberated a vast area.

	The revolutionary masses of the Taiyuan Fertilizer Factory, guided by the great thought of Mao Zedong, have united with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to launch a fierce criticism of the capitalist roaders within the Party, the bourgeois reactionary line, and the handful of capitalist roaders within the factory. Through this revolutionary criticism, the entire factory has achieved revolutionary great alliances by workshop and by department, and a number of cadres have been liberated, laying a solid foundation for the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in this factory have faithfully carried out the bourgeois reactionary line concocted by the top capitalist roader within the Party during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They implemented the policy of "striking down a large number and protecting a few." At the beginning, they instructed middle-level cadres to classify and rank the revolutionary masses, to seize so-called "monsters and demons," and to persecute the revolutionary masses. After the masses launched a criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line, they ordered the middle-level cadres to "turn the fire against themselves," directing the masses' struggle against the general middle-level cadres. As a result, more than 90% of the middle-level cadres were criticized and struggled against. Out of the 32 branch secretaries of the Party in the factory, 28 were "sidelined."

	After the revolutionary masses of the proletariat seized power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, they implemented the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, emphasizing the need to unite with all those who can be united. The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also to liberate all of humanity. Without liberating all of humanity, the proletariat cannot ultimately achieve its own liberation. They raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and helped the deceived masses and erring cadres return to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, launching a counterattack against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party.

	At this moment, the fifth issue of the "Red Flag" magazine published three important articles by the editorial staff, investigators, and Comrade Chen Boda, sounding the charge for a general offensive against the top capitalist roader within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line he represents. The proletarian revolutionary masses of this factory immediately launched a mass criticism movement throughout the factory. The proletarian revolutionary masses believed that to quickly bring the deceived masses back to the proletarian revolutionary line and to quickly stand up the revolutionary cadres, it was necessary to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the poisonous weed of "In Cultivation," completely shattering the spiritual shackles that "In Cultivation" had placed on many people. At the criticism meeting, a cadre who had executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, with a heart full of anger, used his personal experience to denounce the harm that "In Cultivation" had done to him. In the past, when he raised criticisms of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, those people criticized him for having poor "cultivation" and told him to study "In Cultivation" more. Because he had been poisoned by the slave mentality advocated by "In Cultivation," during the Cultural Revolution, he did everything according to what the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party said. As a result, he became a tool for promoting the bourgeois reactionary line, striking down revolutionary comrades. Such exposures and denunciations greatly educated some of the deceived workers. The revolutionary comrades, with a large amount of facts, angrily denounced the brutal persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line against them, further igniting the broad revolutionary masses' hatred towards the top capitalist roader within the Party.

	Through the criticism of the top capitalist roader within the Party, the broad masses of workers gained a deeper understanding of the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line and a clearer recognition of the reactionary nature of the handful of capitalist roaders within the factory. Two conservative elements in the power supply workshop, through the revolutionary criticism, raised their consciousness and, at a general meeting of the factory's workers, launched a counterattack, exposing the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the factory, denouncing the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line to them, and resolving to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to fight side by side with the revolutionary comrades. Many deceived workers also stood up to revolt. The revolutionary comrades showed more understanding towards these workers who had taken the wrong side in the earlier stage of the Cultural Revolution, recognizing that most of these workers were deceived, and warmly welcomed them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Under the banner of revolutionary criticism, cadres who had been harmed by "In Cultivation" and had executed the bourgeois reactionary line, as well as cadres who had previously taken a passive attitude and were prepared to be persecuted, all stood up to revolt. They shattered their spiritual shackles, changed "fear" to "dare," and bravely stood up. In one day on April 1st, they wrote more than 300 big-character posters, exposing and criticizing the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the factory and their plot of "striking down a large number and protecting a few." At the meeting to struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, their speeches were factual, analytical, and critical, hitting the target, and making the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party fall into unprecedented isolation.

	In the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres unified their targets of struggle and ideological understanding. The entire factory finally achieved a revolutionary great alliance by workshop and by department with the leftists as the core. This has provided good conditions for the entire factory to realize the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

    太原化肥厂革命职工革命干部在大批判中并肩战斗
    对准了斗争目标　统一了思想认识
    狠狠打击一小撮　真正解放一大片
    本报讯　太原化肥厂无产阶级革命派，以伟大的毛泽东思想为指针，团结广大革命群众和革命干部，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派、对资产阶级反动路线和厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判。通过革命的大批判，全厂实现了按车间、按部门的革命大联合，并且解放了一批干部，为实现革命的“三结合”打下了扎实的基础。
    这个厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在无产阶级文化大革命中忠实地执行了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所炮制的资产阶级反动路线。他们对干部实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。开始，他们指使中层干部给革命群众分类排队，大抓所谓“牛鬼蛇神”，大整革命群众。在群众对资产阶级反动路线展开批判以后，他们又命令中层干部“引火烧身”，把群众斗争的矛头引向一般中层干部。结果，使百分之九十以上的中层干部挨批、挨斗。全厂三十二个党支部书记，就有二十八个“靠边站”了。
    无产阶级革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权以后，执行了伟大领袖毛主席的指示，要注意团结一切可以团结的人们。无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。他们高举革命的批判旗帜，紧紧地掌握斗争的大方向，启发和帮助受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行反击。
    正在这时候，《红旗》杂志第五期发表了评论员、调查员和戚本禹同志三篇重要文章，吹响了向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线展开总攻击的进军号。这个厂的无产阶级革命派，立即在全厂掀起了一个群众性批判运动。无产阶级革命派认为，要使受蒙蔽的群众尽快回到无产阶级革命路线上来，使革命干部很快地站起来革命，就必须把《修养》这株大毒草批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底砸碎《修养》套在许多人身上的精神枷锁。在批判大会上，一位在文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线的干部，怀着满腔的怒火，用亲身经历控诉了《修养》对他的毒害。过去，他对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派提意见，那些家伙就批评他“修养”差，要他多学习《修养》。他由于中了《修养》提倡的奴隶主义的毒，在文化大革命中，就一切照党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所说的去做。结果，作了推行资产阶级反动路线的工具，打击了革命同志。这样的揭发、控诉，使一些受蒙蔽的职工受到了很大教育。革命派的同志则用大量的事实，愤怒地控诉了资产阶级反动路线对他们的残酷迫害，更加激发了广大革命职工对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的愤恨。
    通过对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的批判，广大职工对资产阶级反动路线的罪恶有了更深刻的认识，对厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动面目也认识得更清楚了。供电车间的两个保守分子，通过革命的大批判，提高了觉悟，在全厂职工大会上，杀了回马枪，揭露了厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，控诉了资产阶级反动路线对他们的毒害，决心回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，和革命派同志并肩战斗。不少受蒙蔽的职工群众，也纷纷起来革命造反。革命派的同志，对于这些在前一阶段文化大革命中站错了队的群众更加谅解，认识到这些群众大多数是受蒙蔽的，对他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，表示热情欢迎。
    在革命的批判旗帜下，曾经受《修养》毒害而执行过资产阶级反动路线的干部，原来抱消极态度、准备挨整的干部，也都奋起造反了。他们砸碎了精神上的枷锁，换“怕”字为“敢”字，勇敢地站了出来。四月一日一天工夫，他们就写出了三百多张大字报，揭发和批判了厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行和他们玩弄的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的阴谋。在斗争一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大会上，他们的发言，有事实，有分析，有批判，能够击中要害，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派陷于空前孤立。
    在革命的大批判中，广大革命职工、革命干部斗争目标一致了，思想认识统一了，全厂终于实现了以左派为核心的按车间、按部门的革命大联合。这就为全厂实现革命的“三结合”提供了良好的条件。
