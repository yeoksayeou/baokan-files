In its introduction to this red book, the "Future Publishing House" in Denmark points out: "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, a summary of the Chinese people's revolutionary and construction experiences over several decades. It tells revolutionaries around the world how to observe and change the world.

The publication of the Swedish edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" will satisfy the urgent demand of the Swedish people who have deep feelings for Chairman Mao. They have been very concerned about the publication of this red book, and many have written letters or personally visited bookstores to inquire about the publication date.

Before the Swedish edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was released, people had to buy the English version to study.

Many Swedes have developed the habit of carrying and reading this little red book at all times. Some can even recite many of Chairman Mao's quotations.

In March of this year, Sweden published the first volume of the Swedish edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Both the Swedish edition of "Selected Works" and "Quotations" were translated by the Swedish Marxist Nils Holmberg and published by Danelius Bookstore.

The Dutch edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was recently published in Belgium by the "International Bookstore" in Brussels. The first edition has a print run of 20,000 copies.

This precious book was published amidst the eager anticipation of the people of the Netherlands and Belgium. Even before its publication, a large number of readers had pre-ordered it from the bookstore.

The Dutch edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is the same size and design as the original Chinese version.

At the same time, the French edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" continues to sell well in various parts of Belgium. In regions outside the French-speaking area, nearly 20,000 copies have already been sold.
