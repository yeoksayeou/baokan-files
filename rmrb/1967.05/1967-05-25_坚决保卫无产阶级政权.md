The twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has arrived. This luminous work is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxist-Leninist literary theory, a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, and a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the tumultuous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this brilliant work has shown its immense power. Looking back over the past year of cultural revolution, we have drawn immense spiritual strength from the "Talks," armed our thoughts, and together with the revolutionary masses of the entire province, we have waged a heroic struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their backers, the Chinese Khrushchovs. We have seized back the Party, government, economic, and cultural powers they had usurped, repulsed their numerous frenzied counterattacks, and firmly grasped the power in our own hands. Currently, the cultural revolution in the entire province is in an excellent situation. All of this is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

In the "Talks," Chairman Mao pointed out: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, and among them, it can also be said that there are two fronts, cultural and military." The cultural front is an extremely important front. Facts tell us that to consolidate and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must not only firmly grasp the gun but also tightly hold the pen. We must learn to fight against enemies with guns and also learn to criticize the bourgeoisie and fight against enemies without guns, so that our power will never change color.

In the seventeen years since liberation, the class struggle on the cultural and ideological front has been extremely sharp and complex. Take Heilongjiang Province as an example. A handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, in order to realize their dream of restoring capitalism, first launched a ferocious attack on the proletariat from the cultural and ideological front. Relying on the stages, newspapers, and broadcasts they occupied, they peddled bourgeois and revisionist goods. They performed plays about emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, wrote revisionist goods, and sang bourgeois decadent tunes. Once the time is ripe, they will turn the proletarian power into bourgeois power, making us fall back into the bitter abyss of the old society. These heart-rending facts have alerted us greatly, and we must never forget or underestimate the sharp and complex class struggle in the ideological realm between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie; otherwise, we will make a grave mistake.

Our People's Liberation Army is a military force created by Chairman Mao, the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the mainstay of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We deeply understand that paying attention to state affairs is paying attention to the dictatorship of the proletariat. The officers and soldiers of our provincial military region, following Chairman Mao's teachings, have bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in this fierce struggle, wholeheartedly supported the revolutionary masses, and severely struck at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, fulfilling the sacred duty of defending and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the richest, most practical, and deepest course in the school of Mao Zedong Thought. In the great waves of class struggle, our officers and soldiers have undergone the most severe tests and tempering, and our level of Mao Zedong Thought has greatly improved. The officers and soldiers have strengthened their class and class struggle consciousness. We have seen with our own eyes how a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the old Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee and their backers, the supreme headquarters, have frantically suppressed the revolutionary youngsters who rose up in rebellion; how they have incited and deceived the uninformed masses to attack the revolutionary leftists; how they have whipped up the black wind of economism, sabotaged industrial and agricultural production; how they have created counter-revolutionary backwash, sabotaged the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. These facts have deeply educated us, making us further understand the great truth that Chairman Mao said in the "Talks": "Politics, whether revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, are the struggle of class against class, not the behavior of a few individuals."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, but serious class struggles still lie before us, and we must not relax our vigilance.

We must, together with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, further seriously study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other works, as well as the "Notice" of May 16, 1966, issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China under Chairman Mao's personal direction. We must grasp the main contradictions, firmly hold the direction of the struggle, and resolutely overthrow, smash, and expose all big and small power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly forever!

    坚决保卫无产阶级政权
    黑龙江省革命委员会常委  黑龙江省军区副司令员  张万春
    毛主席的伟大著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年了。这篇光辉著作是当代马克思列宁主义文艺理论的顶峰，是团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的强大武器，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件。
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命中，这部光辉著作更显示出它的巨大威力。回顾一年来的文化革命，我们从《讲话》中吸取了巨大的精神力量，武装了思想，和全省革命群众一起，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及背后支持他们的中国的赫鲁晓夫作了英勇的斗争，把被他们篡夺了的党、政、财、文大权统统夺了回来，打退了他们多次的疯狂反扑，把政权牢牢地掌握在我们无产阶级自己手里。目前全省文化大革命是一片大好形势。这一切，都是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。”文化战线是个极为重要的战线。事实告诉我们，要巩固和保卫无产阶级政权，不仅要牢牢地掌握枪杆子，还要紧紧地握住笔杆子，既要学会与拿枪的敌人作斗争的本领，也要学会批判资产阶级、与不拿枪的敌人作斗争的本领，才能使我们的政权永不变色。
    解放十七年来，文化思想战线上的阶级斗争极为尖锐复杂。就拿黑龙江省来说，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了实现复辟资本主义的野心，他们首先就是从文化思想战线上向无产阶级发动猖狂进攻的。凭借他们占据的舞台，报纸，广播，大肆贩卖资产阶级、修正主义的货色。他们演的是帝王将相、才子佳人，写的是修正主义的货色，唱的是资产阶级的靡靡之音。一旦时机成熟，他们就会变无产阶级政权为资产阶级政权，使我们重新掉进旧社会的苦难深渊。这些惊心动魄的事实，引起我们极大的警惕，绝不能忘记和轻视意识形态领域里的无产阶级与资产阶级尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，否则就要犯极大的错误。
    我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。
    毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们深深认识到，关心国家大事就是关心无产阶级政权。我们省军区指战员遵照毛主席的教导，在这场激烈的斗争中，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，满腔热情地全心全意地支持无产阶级革命派，狠狠地打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，履行了保卫和巩固无产阶级政权的神圣职责。
    无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东思想大学校的最丰富最实际最深刻的课程。在阶级斗争的大风浪里，我们指战员经受了最严峻的考验和锻炼，毛泽东思想水平提高了一大步。指战员们增强了阶级和阶级斗争的观念。我们亲眼看到了旧黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及支持他们的总后台，是怎样疯狂地镇压革命小将起来造反的；是怎样挑动和欺骗不明真相的群众围攻革命左派的；是怎样大刮经济主义黑风，破坏工农业生产的；是怎样制造反革命的逆流，破坏革命的“三结合”的。这些事实，深刻地教育了我们，使我们进一步认识到毛主席在《讲话》中所说的这个伟大真理：“政治，不论革命的和反革命的，都是阶级对阶级的斗争，不是少数个人的行为。”
    无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，但是严重的阶级斗争仍然摆在我们面前，我们绝不能松懈自己的斗志。
    我们一定要和广大革命群众、革命干部一起，进一步认真学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等著作，以及毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，抓住主要矛盾，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把党内大大小小走资本主义道路当权派，坚决斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，保卫和巩固无产阶级政权，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗永远高高飘扬！
