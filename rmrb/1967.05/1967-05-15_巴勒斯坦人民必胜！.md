Today is "Palestine Day." For nineteen years, the Palestinian people have been waging a tenacious struggle against American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, to reclaim their homeland. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the Palestinian people.

The heavy calamities that the Palestinian people have suffered over the past nineteen years are the direct result of the imperialism led by the United States. In 1948, American and British imperialism colluded to create the "State of Israel," expelling hundreds of thousands of Arab people from their homes, turning them into refugees. This was a sinister step taken by American imperialism to tighten its colonial expansion in the Middle East. For nineteen years, Israel has been an aggressive base for American imperialism in the Middle East, a dagger inserted into the heart of the Arab countries. In addition to directly using military threats and subversive plots to suppress the national liberation struggles of the peoples of various Arab countries, American imperialism has continuously armed Israel to the teeth, using it to provoke and invade Arab countries. This shows that American imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Arab people, and the struggle of the Palestinian people is a common struggle of the peoples of all Arab countries.

The Soviet revisionist leadership claims to be a "friend" of the Arab people, but in reality, it colludes with American imperialism and its lackey Israel, playing a shameful role in betraying the interests of the Arab people. The Soviet revisionist clique has repeatedly advocated using the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to solve the Palestinian problem, vigorously promoting Arab-Israeli "reconciliation." In essence, this is to deprive the Palestinian people of their sacred right to liberate their homeland, forcing the peoples of various Arab countries to recognize the status quo of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. At the recently illegally convened "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference," the Soviet revisionist representative even blatantly obstructed the conference from passing a resolution supporting the just struggle of the Palestinian people. This has made the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries more clearly see the shameful face of the Soviet revisionists as accomplices of American imperialism, betraying the interests of the Arab people.

However, the Arab people are increasingly awakening. They are not intimidated by American imperialism, nor are they deceived by the Soviet revisionist clique. In recent times, the anti-American tide among the peoples of various Arab countries has surged, dealing heavy blows to American imperialism's aggressive activities in the Middle East. The struggle of the Palestinian people to reclaim their homeland and liberate their territory has also seen new developments.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." Through long-term struggle, the Palestinian people have increasingly deeply understood this great truth. The Palestinian people have raised a resounding battle cry: "We want revolution, we want armed struggle!" "Armed struggle is the path to our liberation of Palestine!" The Palestine Liberation Army has also been established. This marks the Palestinian people's struggle entering a new stage.

The struggle of the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries against American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, to defend and maintain national independence, is an integral part of the revolutionary struggle of the people of the world. Currently, we are in a new great era of world revolution. The storm of revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries is raging, and the days of American imperialism and its lackeys are getting worse. As long as the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, they will surely be able to defeat the aggressive activities of American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, against the Arab people, and surely realize the sacred wish of the Palestinian people to return to their homeland.

American imperialism will surely be defeated, and the Palestinian people will surely win!

    巴勒斯坦人民必胜！
    本报评论员
    今天是“巴勒斯坦日”。巴勒斯坦人民，为了反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列，为了争取重返家园，已经坚持了十九年的顽强斗争。中国人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争。
    巴勒斯坦人民，十九年来的沉重灾难，是以美国为首的帝国主义一手造成的。美帝国主义伙同英帝国主义在一九四八年炮制了一个“以色列国”，把巴勒斯坦成百万阿拉伯人赶出自己的家园，成为流离失所的难民。这是美帝国主义为了对中东地区加紧殖民扩张而采取的一个罪恶步骤。十九年来，以色列一直是美帝国主义在中东地区的一个侵略基地，是美帝国主义插在阿拉伯国家中间的一把尖刀。美帝国主义除了直接用军事威胁和颠覆阴谋来镇压阿拉伯各国人民的民族解放斗争以外，还不断大力武装以色列，利用以色列对阿拉伯国家进行挑衅和侵略。这表明，美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人，巴勒斯坦人民的斗争是阿拉伯各国人民的共同斗争。
    苏修领导集团口头上自称是阿拉伯人民的“朋友”，实际上却同美帝国主义及其走狗以色列勾勾搭搭，串通一气，扮演着出卖阿拉伯人民利益的可耻角色。苏修集团一再宣扬用所谓“塔什干精神”解决巴勒斯坦问题，大肆鼓吹阿拉伯—以色列“和解”。这实质上就是要剥夺巴勒斯坦人民解放自己家园的神圣权利，迫使阿拉伯各国人民承认以色列霸占巴勒斯坦国土的现状。在不久前非法召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”上，苏修代表甚至公然阻挠会议通过支持巴勒斯坦人民正义斗争的决议，这就使巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民更加认清了苏修充当美帝帮凶、出卖阿拉伯人民利益的可耻嘴脸。
    但是，阿拉伯人民已经日益觉醒。他们绝不是美帝国主义所吓得倒的，也绝不是苏修集团所骗得了的。最近以来，阿拉伯各国人民的反美怒潮汹涌澎湃，使美帝国主义在中东的侵略活动接连遭到沉重的打击。巴勒斯坦人民争取重返家园、解放国土的斗争，也有了新的发展。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”巴勒斯坦人民从长期的斗争中，越来越深刻地认识了这个伟大的真理。巴勒斯坦人民喊出了响亮的战斗口号：“我们要革命，我们要武装斗争！”“武装斗争是我们解放巴勒斯坦的道路！”巴勒斯坦解放军也已经建立起来。这标志着巴勒斯坦人民的斗争正在进入新的阶段。
    巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，是全世界人民革命斗争的一个组成部分。目前正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。各国人民革命斗争的风暴四起，美帝国主义及其走狗的日子越来越不好过。巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民只要加强团结，坚持斗争，最后一定能够打败美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列对阿拉伯人民的侵略活动，一定能够实现巴勒斯坦人民重返家园的神圣愿望。
    美帝必败，巴勒斯坦人民必胜！
