The Duli Commune in Beijing's Fangshan County has organized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to closely combine local class struggles with the criticism, repudiation, and reform (dou-bi-gai) to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism. Through the revolutionary criticism, the commune's frontline command post for revolution and production, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, has grasped the key issue of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. They have organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to compare the old and new societies, combining the criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party with the local criticism, repudiation, and reform. They have thoroughly eliminated the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line in politics, economics, ideology, and culture, and have eliminated the remnants of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee.

To better carry out the criticism, they have held training classes for the members of the leading cadres of brigades and production teams, political workers, and the responsible persons of revolutionary mass organizations, cultivating a core force for the revolutionary criticism.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have bravely joined the battle. They have written big-character posters, held denunciation meetings and accusation meetings, and severely exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Many poor and lower-middle peasants, with deep hatred and grievances, have denounced the various reactionary fallacies of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party based on their personal experiences. Sixty-six-year-old poor peasant Wang Guocui, at the accusation meeting of the commune, brigade, and production team, with tears in his eyes, repeatedly recounted the bitter life of oppression and exploitation before liberation. He denounced the top power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party for saying that "exploitation is reasonable," "exploitation is meritorious," and "exploitation should be welcomed," praising capitalism with a bunch of nonsense. He said: Chairman Mao saved us from the sea of bitterness, but the top power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party wants to drag us back into the sea of bitterness. We will never allow it. He encouraged the young people to always listen to Chairman Mao and always follow Chairman Mao in making revolution. Many cadres and masses, with indignation, denounced the top power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee for promoting the "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package" in the countryside, pushing material incentives, undermining the collective economy, and engaging in evil activities of capitalist restoration. The original party branch secretary of Shangwan Brigade said: With the support of the top power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Municipal Committee carried out "experiments" in our brigade, wanting us to pursue material incentives for any work, using high work points and high rewards to stimulate the members, pushing revisionism, and not emphasizing proletarian politics at all. The result was that the more they pursued material incentives, the more serious the capitalist thinking became, and the less stable the collective economy was. At the denunciation and accusation meetings, many poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres also denounced the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in pushing the reactionary bourgeois line during the Cultural Revolution.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have had a deeper understanding that the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is a great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. If this struggle is not won, China will go back on its course and change its color. They have expressed that in the future, no matter what they hear, they will compare it with Chairman Mao's words to see if it conforms to Mao Zedong Thought. If it conforms, they will firmly carry it out; if it does not, they will firmly oppose it. Thus, the process of carrying out the revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party has also become the process of studying Chairman Mao's works and establishing Mao Zedong Thought.

With the widespread and in-depth development of the revolutionary criticism, a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is rising. The progress of spring plowing and production has also accelerated. Many brigades and production teams have shown moving examples of starting work early and finishing late, and eagerly taking on difficult and bitter tasks. Both revolution and production have shown a great situation.

    坨里公社结合本地的斗批改肃清修正主义流毒   
    革命大批判有力地促进了革命和生产
    据新华社七日讯　北京市房山县坨里公社，组织广大贫下中农和革命干部，紧紧结合本地阶级斗争实际，大揭大批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，大扫反革命修正主义流毒，大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，促进了革命和生产的迅速发展。
    在革命的大批判中，坨里公社抓革命促生产第一线指挥部在解放军部队的协助下，抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，组织贫下中农和革命干部进行新旧社会的对比，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的批判和本地的斗批改结合起来，从政治、经济、思想、文化各方面彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的流毒，肃清旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的遗毒。为了使大批判更好地进行，他们举办了由大队、生产队领导班子成员、政治工作员和革命群众组织负责人参加的训练班，培养了大批判的骨干力量。
    广大贫下中农和革命干部勇敢地投入了战斗。他们纷纷写大字报，开声讨会、控诉会，狠狠地揭发和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的滔天罪行。许多苦大仇深的贫下中农，以亲身经历痛斥党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的各种反动谬论。六十六岁的老贫农王国粹在公社、大队、生产队的控诉大会上含着眼泪一遍又一遍讲述解放前受压迫受剥削的痛苦生活，痛斥党内头号走资本主义道路当权派说什么“剥削有理”，“剥削有功”，“应当欢迎剥削”等替资本主义擦脂抹粉的一派胡言乱语。他说：毛主席把我们救出了苦海，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派要把我们再向苦海里拉，我们决不允许。他鼓励青年人要永远听毛主席的话，永远跟着毛主席闹革命。许多干部和群众，以愤怒的心情控诉党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，在农村推行“四大自由”、“三自一包”，大搞物质刺激，瓦解集体经济，搞资本主义复辟的罪恶活动。上万大队原党支部书记说：在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，旧市委反革命修正主义集团在我们大队搞“实验”，要我们不论干什么活都大搞物质刺激，用高工分高奖励刺激社员，大搞修正主义，根本不突出无产阶级政治。结果越是追求物质刺激，资本主义思想越严重，集体经济越不巩固。在控诉和声讨会上，许多贫下中农和干部还控诉了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在文化大革命中推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行。
    通过革命的大批判，广大贫下中农和革命干部更加深刻地认识到，同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的一场大搏斗。如果不取得这场斗争的胜利，中国就要走回头路，就要改变颜色。他们表示，今后不管听到什么话，都要和毛主席的话对一对，看看是否合乎毛泽东思想，合乎毛泽东思想的坚决做，不合乎的坚决反对。这样，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行革命大批判的过程，也就成为大学毛主席著作的过程，大立毛泽东思想的过程。
    随着革命的大批判的广泛深入开展，一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮正在兴起。春耕生产进度也加快了。许多大队、生产队出现了早上工、迟下工，难活苦活争着干的动人事例。革命、生产都出现了大好形势。
