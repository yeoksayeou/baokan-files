Editor's Note: Overcoming tendencies of anarchism and further establishing a new order for revolution and production is an important issue that many industrial and mining enterprises need to address. The experience of the Datong Coal Mine proves that to solve this problem, political and ideological work must be strengthened to enhance the self-awareness of the revolutionary discipline among the masses. Simultaneously, the authority of the leadership team must be established.

How can the leadership team establish revolutionary authority? This requires arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought, which holds the highest authority among the masses, to become revolutionary. Only such a leadership can be close to the masses rather than bureaucratic; only such a leadership can be correct and not engage in blind command.

With revolutionary authority established in the leadership team, educating the masses on revolutionary discipline becomes more effective. Most workers understand the importance of voluntarily adhering to discipline. The anarchist thoughts among a minority of the masses can be corrected through appropriate education and criticism, and voluntary discipline can be established.

Lenin pointed out that the proletarian party maintains its discipline through three conditions: first, the consciousness of the vanguard of the proletariat; second, close ties with the broad masses; and third, correct political leadership.

This is the combination of the revolutionary authority of the leadership and the voluntary revolutionary discipline of the masses.

The new order of revolution and production is established on the basis of the combination of the revolutionary authority of the leadership and the voluntary discipline of the masses.

According to a report from our newspaper, the troops of the People's Liberation Army supporting the Datong Coal Mine have been conducting political and ideological work for the cadres while educating the workers on revolutionary discipline. This has further strengthened production leadership, establishing a good order for revolution and production, and promoting both revolution and production.

Not long ago, due to the sabotage by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the production order at the Datong Coal Mine was disrupted for a short period. Anarchist tendencies among a few workers grew, labor discipline relaxed, and production was affected. In late February, troops from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army arrived at the mine and immediately joined forces with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to launch a cultural revolution. They launched a power seizure struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. After the proletarian revolutionary masses took power, to establish proletarian revolutionary authority and maintain revolutionary discipline, the soldiers helped them focus on political and ideological work and revolutionary discipline education.

They first focused their work on the cadres. By correctly implementing the party's cadre policy, a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary leadership team was quickly established to shoulder the responsibilities of revolution and production. The cadres participating in the "three-in-one combination" generally worked actively and were willing to make new achievements in their new positions. However, some cadres were hesitant and reluctant to take responsibility for their work. Some cadres still adhered to the old bureaucratic leadership methods of sitting in the office, listening to reports, and making phone calls, lacking revolutionary spirit. When they encountered difficulties, they blamed the masses for being "uncooperative" and themselves for having "no authority," and so on.

How can the new leadership team establish revolutionary authority? The soldiers conducted detailed political and ideological work with the cadres, reminding them that while the masses should respect the leadership, the leadership's authority must be earned through their actions. Mao Zedong Thought is the most authoritative. Only by arming oneself with Mao Zedong Thought and serving the people wholeheartedly can one establish true authority. The soldiers helped the cadres establish a system for studying Chairman Mao's works and studied together with them, sharing their thoughts. On the first day of the establishment of the leadership team at the New Four Mine, the soldiers studied "In Memory of Norman Bethune" with them, eliminating selfishness and establishing the idea of being a servant of the people. This "first lesson" was very effective. The four representatives of revolutionary organizations and worker representatives participating in the leadership team all expressed their willingness to continue participating in labor and always stay with the masses, not to be officials or lords. A representative of a revolutionary organization who had previously been detached from production immediately returned to the coal mining team to participate in production and lead production.

For those cadres who had not yet shed their bureaucratic leadership style, the soldiers used their actions to teach them the experience of implementing the "Four Firsts" and carrying forward the "Three-Eight Style." A political commissar from the unit personally led some members of the leadership team to work underground, study Chairman Mao's works with the workers, and address the workers' active thoughts. These actions greatly inspired the cadres. They followed the soldiers' example, placing the revolutionization of their thoughts first, frequently going among the masses, and humbly listening to the masses' opinions. A team leader from the Coal Gully Mine said, "Previously, when production was not going well, I blamed the workers for being uncooperative. Now I understand that it is not the workers who are uncooperative, but I who have not acted according to Mao Zedong Thought." When the cadres cast aside selfishness, revitalized their revolutionary spirit, and appeared before the masses with a new attitude, they also gained the trust and support of the masses.

The soldiers also assisted the proletarian revolutionary masses in educating the masses on revolutionary discipline. They explained that the unreasonable disciplines and systems that suppressed workers and restricted production development in the past enterprises must be abolished; however, the revolutionary disciplines and systems that are in the fundamental interests of the working class and beneficial to production development must be strictly observed. They also educated the workers to analyze cadres by class, not to generally reject them. For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, they must be fought down, fought to ruin, and fought to disgrace; for revolutionary leading cadres, they should be supported, and their correct commands should be accepted.

After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country," the soldiers launched extensive propaganda activities throughout the mine and organized all workers to study and discuss it. Everyone unanimously proposed to respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to be a model in the five aspects mentioned in the letter. The workers also analyzed some incorrect statements. In the past, some people said things like "cadres are not allowed to manage workers, whoever manages will be opposed." Some individuals misinterpreted the spirit of "liberating oneself" and did not observe labor discipline, acting freely. Everyone pointed out in the discussion that these are manifestations of anarchism and must be firmly opposed. Revolutionary workers must firmly observe and obey the revolutionary discipline and authority of the proletariat. Everyone also recalled the scene a few months ago when the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party incited some people to leave their production posts and disrupt labor discipline, and they more clearly realized that disrupting revolutionary discipline is the plot of the class enemy. We must voluntarily observe labor discipline and establish a good production order.

Based on thorough political and ideological education, the cadres and workers of the Datong Coal Mine, in accordance with the requirements proposed in the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and combined with the specific situation of the coal mine, formulated some systems and regulations to maintain labor discipline through democratic discussion. Various mining areas also restored or established systems such as pre-shift mobilization meetings and post-shift evaluation meetings to activate democratic life. These meetings are both study sessions of Chairman Mao's works and democratic life meetings, giving workers the opportunity to fully discuss production issues democratically. After these systems were promulgated, the workers enthusiastically supported and voluntarily implemented them. The attendance rate of workers in various mines generally increased, the phenomenon of debating the cultural revolution on the production posts disappeared, and a good situation of seizing the revolution and promoting production emerged.

The troops of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in the Datong Coal Mine have achieved remarkable results in conducting political and ideological education for the workers. This is a soldier from the Eighth Company of the unit discussing the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" with the workers.

    帮助革命干部用革命行动树立威信
    教育广大职工自觉地遵守劳动纪律
    支援大同煤矿的解放军做好政治思想工作，建立起革命和生产的良好秩序
    编者按：克服无政府主义倾向，进一步建立革命和生产的新秩序，是当前很多工矿企业需要解决的一个重要问题。大同煤矿的经验证明，解决这个问题，不仅要通过政治思想工作，加强群众自觉的革命纪律，同时还要树立领导班子的革命权威。
    领导班子怎样才能树立革命权威呢？这就要用在群众中享有最高权威的毛泽东思想武装自己，使自己革命化。这样的领导才会是密切联系群众的，而不是官僚主义的；这样的领导才可能是正确的，而不会瞎指挥。
    领导班子有了革命权威，再对群众进行革命纪律的教育，是比较容易收效的。因为多数工人是懂得自觉地遵守纪律的重要性的，少数群众中的无政府主义思想，只要经过适当的教育和批评是能够得到改正的，自觉的纪律也是能够建立起来的。
    列宁指出，无产阶级政党维持自己的纪律依靠三个条件：一是靠无产阶级先锋队的觉悟，二是靠同广大群众的密切联系，三是靠政治领导的正确。
    这就是领导的革命权威和群众自觉的革命纪律相结合。
    革命和生产的新秩序正是建立在领导的革命权威和群众自觉的纪律相结合的基础上的。
    本报讯　支援大同煤矿的人民解放军某部，一面做好对干部的政治思想工作，一面做好对职工的革命纪律教育，进一步加强了生产领导，建立起革命和生产的良好秩序，革命和生产都获得了发展。
    不久以前，大同煤矿由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的破坏，在一个短时间内，生产秩序一度遭到扰乱，少数职工中的无政府主义倾向有所滋长，劳动纪律松弛，生产受到了影响。二月下旬，人民解放军某部来到了矿山，立即协同无产阶级革命派，大抓无产阶级文化大革命，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开夺权斗争。在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，为了树立无产阶级革命权威和维护革命纪律，解放军同志又帮助他们大抓政治思想工作和革命的纪律教育。
    他们首先把工作重点放在干部方面。由于正确贯彻党的干部政策，迅速建立了革命的“三结合”临时领导班子，挑起了革命和生产的担子。参加“三结合”的干部，一般都积极工作，愿意在新岗位上立新功。但是，有一些干部“怕”字当头，缩手缩脚，对工作不敢大胆负责。也有些干部仍然习惯于过去那套坐办公室听汇报、打电话的官僚主义领导方法，缺乏革命精神；碰了钉子，就埋怨群众“不听话”，自己“没有威信”等等。
    新的领导班子怎样才能有革命的权威呢？解放军同志对干部进行了细致的政治思想工作，提醒大家：群众固然应当尊重领导，但是领导的威信是要靠自己的言行取得的。毛泽东思想是最有权威的。只有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，全心全意为人民服务，才能树立起真正的威信。解放军同志帮助干部建立了学习毛主席著作的制度，并且和他们一起学习，一起亮思想。四新矿的领导班子在成立的第一天，解放军同志就和他们一起学习《为人民服务》，破除“私”字，树立当人民勤务员的思想。这个“第一课”上得很好，参加领导班子的四个革命组织代表和工人代表，都表示今后要继续参加劳动，永远和群众在一起，不做官当老爷。原先脱产的一位革命组织代表，立即返回采煤队去参加生产，领导生产。
    对那些还没有摆脱官僚主义领导作风的干部，解放军同志就用言传身教的办法，给他们传授贯彻“四个第一”和发扬“三八作风”的经验。部队的一位政治委员，亲自带了领导班子的一些成员，深入井下参加劳动，和工人一起学习毛主席著作，抓群众的活思想。这些做法使干部受到很大的启示。他们仿效解放军的做法，把自己的思想革命化放在第一位，经常深入群众，虚心听取群众的意见。煤峪口矿的一位采煤队长说：“过去生产上不去，我就埋怨工人不听话。现在我明白了，不是工人不听话，而是我没有按照毛泽东思想办事。”当干部们丢掉了“私”字，振作革命精神，以新的姿态在群众面前出现的时候，他们也就取得了群众的信赖和拥护。
    解放军同志还协助无产阶级革命派对群众进行革命纪律教育。他们说明，对于过去企业里压制工人、束缚生产发展的不合理的纪律和制度，一定要加以废除；但是符合工人阶级根本利益，有利于生产发展的革命纪律和制度，一定要严格遵守。同时教育工人，对干部要作阶级分析，不能一概排斥。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一定要把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭；对革命的领导干部，则应当支持他们，接受他们的正确指挥。
    《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发表以后，解放军同志在全矿展开了大张旗鼓的宣传活动，组织全体职工进行学习讨论。大家一致提出，要响应毛主席和党中央的号召，做信里所提出的五个方面的模范。职工们还对一些不正确的说法，进行了分析。过去，有的人说什么“干部不许管工人，谁管就造谁的反”。有个别人曲解“自己解放自己”的精神，不守劳动纪律，自由行动。大家在讨论中指出，这些都是无政府主义的表现，必须坚决反对。革命的工人对于无产阶级的革命纪律和革命权威，一定要坚决遵守和服从。大家还回忆了几个月前党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派唆使一些人离开生产岗位、破坏劳动纪律的情景，更加清楚地认识到，破坏革命的纪律是阶级敌人的阴谋。我们一定要自觉地遵守劳动纪律，建立良好的生产秩序。
    在进行了充分的政治思想教育的基础上，大同煤矿的干部和职工，根据中共中央的信里所提出的要求，结合煤矿的具体情况，经过民主讨论，订出了一些维护劳动纪律的制度和规定。各矿区还恢复或建立了班前动员会、班后讲评会等制度，活跃民主生活。这些会，既是毛主席著作学习会，又是民主生活会，使工人们有机会对生产问题进行充分的民主讨论。这些制度颁布以后，工人们都热烈拥护，自觉执行，各矿职工出勤率普遍上升，在生产岗位上辩论文化大革命问题的现象消除，出现了抓革命促生产的良好局面。（附图片）
