Title: Anarchism as a Punishment for Opportunism

Anarchism is a punishment for the crimes of opportunism. In the process of the proletarian revolutionary forces achieving revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and in the great struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the anarchist trend of thought is the enemy of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

The emergence of the anarchist trend of thought in our ranks is not accidental. Semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China was a country with a vast small bourgeoisie. Although our country has achieved socialist nationalization and collectivization, small-bourgeois ideology still has a considerable influence among the broad masses and will not disappear quickly. This influence provides the soil for the growth of the anarchist trend of thought.

In his book "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," Lenin said: "The small proprietors, ... constantly oppressed under capitalism, often experiencing a rapid and sharp deterioration in their conditions of life, leading to ruin, are easily driven into extreme revolutionaryism, but cannot display steadfastness, organization, discipline, and firmness." (Lenin Selected Works, Volume 4, People's Publishing House, 1965 edition, page 200)

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, proposed and implemented a reactionary bourgeois line. They labeled revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and revolutionary cadres as "black gangs" in many places and units, attempting to suppress the surging revolutionary mass movement. At the same time, they vigorously spread the anarchist trend of thought of "completely rejecting and completely overthrowing," disrupting proletarian revolutionary discipline and proletarian dictatorship.

The broad proletarian revolutionary forces have resolutely resisted the brutal persecution of this reactionary bourgeois line. However, the reactionary bourgeois line will continue to manifest itself in various forms.

The conscious discipline of the proletariat is based on the correct line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The reactionary bourgeois line and all opportunist lines can only rely on slavishness and spontaneous blindness to maintain their rule. When opportunism is openly bankrupt, it will not disappear. It may move from one extreme to another and use anarchism to serve its purposes. Opportunism and anarchism are, in essence, twins.

As Lenin pointed out in his book, "Anarchism is often a punishment for the crimes of opportunism in the workers' movement. These two monstrosities complement each other." (Ibid, page 200)

Using anarchism to resist the reactionary bourgeois line cannot destroy the reactionary bourgeois line. In some cases, anarchism easily manifests a tendency of being "left" in form but right in essence. As Lenin said, this kind of anarchism "in any major issue, deviates from the conditions and requirements of the proletariat's persistent class struggle"; "this revolutionary vacillation, flashy but empty, easily turns into submission, despondency, indulgence in illusions, and even into a 'mad' infatuation with this or that bourgeois 'fashionable' trend—all this is well known." (Ibid, page 200)

Overthrowing anarchism is a revolution to criticize the bourgeois worldview, establish the proletarian worldview, and break down private interests to build public ones. Because, ultimately, anarchism is bourgeois individualism. Anarchists "although they 'ferociously' attack the bourgeoisie, they still stand on the bourgeois worldview." (On the Attitude of the Workers' Party Towards Religion, 1909, Lenin Selected Works, Volume 2, People's Publishing House, 1965 edition, page 278.) In "Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder," Lenin pointed out: "Bolshevism, when it was born in 1903, inherited the tradition of waging an uncompromising struggle against the small-bourgeois and semi-anarchist (or anarchist-tending) revolutionaryism," (Lenin Selected Works, Volume 4, People's Publishing House, 1965 edition, page 201) and he emphasized: "Bolshevism has grown, taken shape, and been tempered in a long struggle against small-bourgeois revolutionaryism." (Ibid, page 200)

Today, the proletarian revolutionary forces need to review Lenin's teachings.

Completely eliminating the poison of anarchism is not an easy task. Those with serious anarchist thoughts who are unwilling to examine their souls may acknowledge their mistakes in certain situations but often relapse in others. If they do not resolutely correct their mistakes, it is very dangerous.

Proletarian revolutionary comrades! Let us take action, using Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon. While conducting a thorough criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must thoroughly criticize and eliminate anarchism within the revolutionary ranks and establish the organizational discipline of the proletarian revolution. Build the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary forces into a highly proletarianized and highly revolutionary fighting collective. In the great storms of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, temper ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    无政府主义是对机会主义罪过的一种惩罚
    任立新
    在无产阶级革命派实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的伟大斗争中，无政府主义思潮是无产阶级革命派的敌人。
    无政府主义思潮反映到我们的队伍中来，并不是偶然的。
    半殖民地半封建的旧中国，是一个小资产阶级极其广大的国家。我国已经实现了社会主义的国有化和集体化，但是，小资产阶级思想在广大群众中，还不可能很快地消失，还有相当深厚的影响。这种影响，就是无政府主义思潮生长的土壤。
    列宁在《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》一书中说过：“小私有者，……由于在资本主义制度下经常受到压迫，生活往往急剧地、迅速地恶化，以至于破产，所以容易转向极端的革命性，而不能表现出坚韧性、组织性、纪律性和坚定性。”（《列宁选集》第四卷，人民出版社一九六五年版，第二○○页）
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，提出并推行了一条资产阶级反动路线。他们在不少地方和单位，把革命群众打成“反革命”，把革命干部打成“黑帮”，妄图以此来镇压轰轰烈烈的革命群众运动。同时，他们还极力散布“一概排斥，一概打倒”的无政府主义思潮，破坏无产阶级的革命纪律，破坏无产阶级专政。
    广大无产阶级革命派，对这条资产阶级反动路线的残酷迫害进行了坚决的反抗。但是，资产阶级反动路线还会利用其他不同形式表现出来。
    无产阶级自觉的纪律性，是建立在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确路线的基础上的。而资产阶级反动路线和一切机会主义路线一样，只能依靠奴隶主义和自发的盲目性来维持自己的统治。当机会主义公开破产的时候，它不会就销声匿迹的。它可能由一个极端走向另一个极端，而利用无政府主义去为它服务。机会主义和无政府主义在实质上是一对双生子。
    正如列宁在书中所指出的那样，“无政府主义往往是对工人运动中机会主义罪过的一种惩罚。这两种畸形东西是互相补充的。”（同上，第二○○页）
    用无政府主义来反抗资产阶级反动路线，绝不能摧毁资产阶级反动路线。无政府主义在一些情况下容易表现出形“左”实右的倾向。正象列宁所说，这种无政府主义“在任何重大问题上，都离开无产阶级进行坚韧的阶级斗争的条件和要求”；“这种革命性动摇不定，华而不实，它的特性是很快会转为俯首听命、消沉颓丧、耽于幻想，甚至转为‘疯狂地’醉心于这种或那种资产阶级的‘时髦’思潮，——这一切都是人所共知的。”（同上，第二○○页）
    打倒无政府主义，这是一场批判资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观，破“私”立“公”的革命。因为，无政府主义，归根结底是资产阶级个人主义。无政府主义者“虽然非常‘猛烈地’攻击资产阶级，但是他们还是站在资产阶级世界观的立场上。”（《论工人政党对宗教的态度》，一九○九年，《列宁选集》第二卷，人民出版社一九六五年版，第二七八页。）列宁在《共产主义运动中的“左派”幼稚病》一书中指出：“布尔什维主义在一九○三年诞生时，便继承了同小资产阶级的、半无政府主义的（或者是倾向无政府主义的）革命性作无情斗争的传统”，（《列宁选集》第四卷，人民出版社一九六五年版，第二○一页）他还强调指出：“布尔什维主义是在同小资产阶级的革命性作长期斗争中成长、形成和得到锻炼的”。（同上，第二○○页）
    今天，无产阶级革命派有必要重温列宁的这些教导。
    彻底肃清无政府主义的流毒，并不是一件容易的事情。少数无政府主义思想严重，而又不愿触及自己灵魂的人，虽然可能在某种场合下承认自己的错误，但在另一种情况下往往又会重犯，如果不坚决改正自己的错误，那是很危险的。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们！让我们行动起来，用毛泽东思想作为我们战斗的武器，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判的同时，要大破革命队伍中的无政府主义，大立无产阶级革命的组织纪律性。把无产阶级革命派的队伍建设成一个非常无产阶级化，非常革命化的战斗集体。在两个阶级，两条道路，两条路线斗争的大风大浪中，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业坚强可靠的接班人。
