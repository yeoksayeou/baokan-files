The Kathmandu-Kodari Highway, stretching over 104 kilometers, is a section of the Kathmandu-Lhasa Highway within Nepal's borders. It starts from the famous city of Bhaktapur near Nepal's capital Kathmandu, winding through the southern slopes of the Himalayas, crossing steep cliffs and deep valleys, and leading to the border town of Kodari.

This highway was built according to the agreement signed by the governments of China and Nepal in October 1961 to construct a road from China's Tibet region to Nepal's capital Kathmandu. The Chinese government provided unconditional economic and technical aid without any political strings attached, respecting the sovereignty and rights of the recipient country. The Nepalese government oversaw the construction project. In May 1962, Chinese road experts arrived in Nepal to conduct surveys and design work. Construction began in June 1963 and was completed by April of this year. This 104-kilometer-long highway passes through 86 kilometers of mountainous and river-crossed terrain. The geological structure along the route is complex, with many sections requiring the blasting of cliffs and steep walls, making the construction extremely challenging.

The imperialist United States, the revisionist Soviet Union, and the reactionary Indian government, which have always been hostile to Sino-Nepalese friendship and the economic development of both countries, were extremely anxious about the construction of this highway. They viewed it as a thorn in their side and did everything possible to sabotage and denigrate it. From the outset of the highway's construction, U.S. imperialism spread the rumor that "the Chinese will take ten years to complete this road." The Indian reactionary government also used its propaganda machine to spread lies, inciting anti-Sino-Nepalese sentiment, claiming that building this road was "dangerous" for Nepal and that Nepal "should not build a road with China," even going so far as to interfere in Nepal's internal affairs. The U.S. and Indian reactionaries also threatened to cut off "aid" to Nepal, with India even seizing Chinese construction machinery en route to Nepal via India. The Soviet revisionists also spread slanderous rumors against the Chinese road experts, attempting to sabotage the construction of this highway.

The hardworking and brave Nepalese people, along with the Chinese road experts, technicians, and workers, closely cooperated and, with redoubled efforts, built this highway, defeating the various sabotage plots of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries.

To complete this road of friendship, they demonstrated a spirit of bravery, fearlessness, and relentless struggle, overcoming various difficulties posed by natural conditions. On the Himalayas, they worked day and night, blasting rocks, building bridges, enduring scorching heat and bitter cold, heavy rains, and floods, steadily laying the ties of friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal.

Chinese technical and construction personnel emphasized political work, diligently studying the works of Chairman Mao, and strictly following his teachings to wholeheartedly "serve the Chinese people and the people of the world." They took Dr. Bethune, Zhang Zide, and the old man of the mountains as their examples, embodying the revolutionary spirit of fearing neither hardship nor death. They shared hardships with Nepalese workers in the deep mountains. Following Chairman Mao's instructions on hard work and thrift, they made every effort to save the recipient country's economic expenditures. They lived in tents, slept on camp beds, used kerosene lamps, ate dry rations, drank spring water, exposed themselves to wind and rain, and battled with nature side by side with Nepalese workers. To complete the task, they worked day and night. Some comrades, despite falling ill, insisted on working. In the intense struggle, six Chinese construction workers sacrificed their lives, watering the flowers of Sino-Nepalese friendship with their blood.

The Nepalese people made tremendous contributions to the construction of this Sino-Nepalese friendship road. Every year after the rainy season, more than ten thousand workers would work day and night to build this road. This was an unprecedented feat in Nepal. To participate in the road construction, many people moved their families to the roadside. In their labor, they fully demonstrated the spirit of hard work, diligence, and bravery, and showed boundless creativity.

The Nepalese government, to strengthen Sino-Nepalese friendship and enhance friendly exchanges between the two countries, attached great importance to the construction of this highway, dispatching a large number of engineering technicians and workers to participate in the road construction.

The completion of this friendship road fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of the peoples of China and Nepal in conquering the Himalayas and their firm resolve to develop friendly relations between the two countries. It also powerfully proved that the peoples of Asian countries can take the road of self-reliance with their own hands. Ultimately, it proved the truth pointed out by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao: "The people have boundless creative power."

The Kathmandu-Kodari Highway, built through the joint efforts of the peoples of China and Nepal, not only achieved a relatively fast construction speed but also ensured high-quality engineering. The route is economically rational, and the road surface is smooth, making it one of the best roads in Nepal at present.

Chinese technicians not only helped the Nepalese people build the best modern highway but also, without reservation, imparted technical knowledge to Nepalese technicians and workers, vigorously training Nepalese technical cadres, and sincerely helping Nepal achieve self-reliance. A large number of Nepalese personnel have already become quite proficient in road surveying, construction, mechanical operation, and repair, and a Nepalese road construction team is taking shape.

The official opening of this highway will undoubtedly bind the peoples of China and Nepal even more closely together. The deep friendship between the peoples of China and Nepal will stand tall and evergreen like the Himalayas! (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 中尼友谊之路

    中尼友谊之路
    全长百余公里  穿过峭崖深谷
    加德满都—科达里公路全长一○四公里，是加德满都—拉萨公路在尼泊尔境内的一段，它从尼泊尔首都加德满都附近的著名城市巴德冈起，由西南向东北，逶迤起伏于喜马拉雅山南麓的倾斜面上，经过峭崖深谷，通往中尼边界的城镇科达里。
    这条公路是根据中尼两国政府一九六一年十月签订的关于修建从中国西藏地区到尼泊尔首都加德满都的公路的协定，由中国帮助修建的。中国政府对修建这条公路提供了无偿的、不附带任何政治条件和特权的经济技术援助，并尊重受援国的主权和权利，由尼泊尔政府主持修建工程。一九六二年五月，中国公路专家来到尼泊尔进行勘测设计工作，一九六三年六月开工，到今年四月建成。这条全长一百零四公里的公路，有八十六公里通过山峦重叠、河流纵横的地带。沿线地质构造复杂，许多路面要在悬崖峭壁上开凿出来，工程异常艰巨。
    粉碎美苏阴谋  突破印度阻挠
    一贯敌视中尼友谊和两国经济发展的美帝、苏修和印度反动派对于这条公路的建设十分恐慌，它们把它看作眼中钉、肉中刺，千方百计进行破坏和诋毁。美帝国主义从这条公路一开始修建就散布：“中国人修建这条公路，十年也通不了。”印度反动派也开动宣传机器大肆造谣，挑拨中尼关系，说什么修这条公路对尼泊尔“有危险”，“尼泊尔不应当同中国之间修路”，甚至粗暴地干涉尼泊尔内政。美、印反动派还以停止
  “援助”来对尼泊尔施加压力，印度并扣压中国取道印度运往尼泊尔的筑路机器。苏联修正主义者也对中国筑路专家进行种种造谣诬蔑，妄想破坏这条公路的建设。
    勤劳勇敢的尼泊尔人民和中国公路专家、技术人员、职工密切合作，用加倍努力建设这条公路的实际行动击败了美帝、苏修和印度反动派的种种破坏阴谋。
    大力突出政治  战胜种种困难
    为了建成这条友谊之路，他们发挥了勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，战胜了天然条件所造成的各种困难。在喜马拉雅山上，他们披星戴月，开凿岩石，架设桥梁，战胜酷暑和严寒，战胜大雨和洪水，节节胜利地铺设着中尼两国人民友谊的纽带。
    中国的技术和施工人员大力突出政治，努力学习毛主席著作，严格地按照毛主席教导的全心全意地“为中国人民和全世界人民服务”的无产阶级国际主义精神办事，处处以白求恩、张思德、老愚公为榜样，发扬一不怕苦二不怕死的革命英雄主义精神。他们同尼泊尔民工在一起同甘共苦，在深山里施工。他们按照毛主席关于艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的指示，尽可能为受援国节省经济开支。他们住的是帐篷，睡的是行军床，点的是煤油灯，吃干粮，饮泉水，餐风宿露，浴日经霜，同尼泊尔民工同心协力，同大自然搏斗。为了完成任务，他们不分昼夜地工作，有的同志患病也坚持工作。在紧张的战斗中，有六名中国施工人员光荣地献出了自己的生命，用鲜血浇灌了中尼两国人民友谊的花朵。
    尼泊尔人民为建设这条中尼友谊之路，作出了巨大的贡献。每年雨季过后，都有万人以上的浩浩荡荡的施工队伍日日夜夜地为建设这条公路进行辛勤的劳动。这在尼泊尔是空前的壮举。为了参加筑路工程，许多人把家搬到公路附近。在劳动中，他们充分发扬了艰苦奋斗、勤劳、勇敢的精神和表现了无限的创造力。
    群众力量无限  友谊万古长青
    尼泊尔政府为了加强中尼友好，加强两国的友好往来，很重视这条公路的建设，派出了大批工程技术人员和工人参加筑路工程。
    这条友谊之路的建成充分显示了中尼两国人民征服喜马拉雅山的英雄气概和发展中尼两国人民友好关系的坚强决心。也有力地证明了亚洲国家人民是能够用自己的双手走上自力更生的道路的。归根到底它证明了世界人民的伟大导师毛主席指出的真理：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”
    在中尼两国人民共同努力下建成的加德满都—科达里公路，不仅在建设速度方面是较快的，而且在工程质量方面也很好。公路的路线去向，经济合理，路面平坦，是尼泊尔当前最好的公路之一。
    中国技术人员不仅帮助尼泊尔人民修建了最好的现代化公路，并且毫无保留地向尼泊尔技术人员和工人传授技术，大力培养尼泊尔的技术骨干，真心诚意地帮助尼泊尔自力更生。大批尼泊尔人员已经能够比较熟练地掌握公路测量、施工、机械操作、修理等技术，一支尼泊尔的筑路工程队伍正在形成。
    这条公路的正式通车，必将把中尼两国人民更加紧密地联结在一起，中尼两国人民的深厚情谊必将象喜马拉雅山一样，巍然屹立，万古长青！（据新华社讯）
