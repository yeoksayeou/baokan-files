In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the high tide of criticizing the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, at the moment when the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of laboring people across the nation, together with the revolutionary people of the whole world, are enthusiastically celebrating the May Day International Labor Day, the much-anticipated large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts - Celebrating the 17th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China" is being shown in various places across the nation. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres regard this as a great joyous event. With hearts filled with longing for Chairman Mao day and night, they eagerly watched this film and drew immense inspiration and strength from it. They resolutely declared that they would definitely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, defend to the death Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

When a red sun rose from the East China Sea and the radiant image of Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts, appeared on the screen, the audience joyfully applauded. They saw Chairman Mao, in his old age, with a radiant face, full of vigor, and in good health. Everyone felt extremely happy and could not help but shout together with the millions of revolutionary masses on the screen: "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand times long live!"

The comrades of the Liu Huilan Group in the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory said excitedly after watching the film: "Chairman Mao, it is you who led the Chinese people to overthrow the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people, liberating the workers and poor peasants; it is you who led the Chinese people to carry out the great socialist revolution and socialist construction, achieving one great victory after another; it is your thoughts that illuminate China and the future of revolutionary people all over the world. Chairman Mao, you are the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, you are the greatest genius of contemporary times, you are the reddest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world. Chairman Mao, we shout a thousand times, sing ten thousand times, and we can never sing enough of our boundless love, boundless admiration, boundless loyalty, and boundless worship for you." A deputy director of the Taiyuan Revolutionary Committee said: "Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and relies on the masses the most, leading the revolutionary people to achieve one victory after another in the midst of stormy waves. We must forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life."

The Red Guards, who have made immortal contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many of whom have received inspections from the great leader Chairman Mao in front of Tiananmen, could not suppress their excitement when they saw Chairman Mao's radiant image on the screen again. The revolutionary youngsters of Wuhan Medical College said: Chairman Mao supports us revolutionary youngsters the most and has great expectations for us. They declared that at this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, they must "resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." At the same time, they must overcome non-proletarian thoughts in their minds, continuously improve the level of struggle, and unswervingly carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary youngsters of Guiyang City expressed after watching this film that in the current great criticism of the revolution, they must further achieve revolutionary great unity, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly overthrow the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, cut off their black hands extending into various fields, and thoroughly smash the imperialists' and all reactionaries' illusions of restoring capitalism in our third and fourth generations, ensuring that our country will never change color for ten thousand years.

Many old workers in Lanzhou City watched this film with tears of excitement. When they saw Chairman Mao walking over the Golden Water Bridge, walking among the masses, shaking hands with revolutionary masses, sitting on the ground, and watching fireworks with everyone, they could not help but applaud and shout with the revolutionary masses in the film. They said: Chairman Mao is forever in our hearts. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, thoroughly criticize and expose the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and ensure that the socialist mountains will never change color. The revolutionary peasants in the suburbs of Wuhan were all inspired and joyful after watching the film. They said, we poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," strive for greater harvests in agricultural production this year, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, who have made great achievements in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, watched this film and gained boundless strength. They said, we are the people's children created and led by Chairman Mao. We will definitely better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely overthrow the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, excellently complete the glorious tasks of supporting the left, aiding industry, aiding agriculture, military control, and military training, and defend Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao to the death!
