A group of Bulgarian Communists wrote a letter to the Chinese Communist Party led by the great helmsman Comrade Mao Zedong on the eve of May Day, warmly congratulating the International Labor Day.

The letter said, the great helmsman Comrade Mao Zedong not only leads the Chinese workers and peasants forward, but also leads all the oppressed peoples and proletarians of the world forward.

The letter said: The greatest holiday of all workers of the world—May Day—has arrived. In the past, tens of thousands of patriotic fighters sacrificed their lives bravely in the struggle for the proletariat. For this, we, the living, must inherit their cause, and even if we have to sacrifice our lives, we should dedicate them. The letter went on to say: Our eyes are all focused on the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is the strongest party in the world, leading the struggle to eliminate imperialism, and it is supported by the advanced proletariat in all aspects.

The letter said: The Chinese people should feel the greatest joy, because they have a wise, brave, and talented leader, the oldest revolutionary who has gone through countless struggles, Comrade Mao Zedong. For this, we repeat: We must protect our leader Mao Zedong as we protect our own eyes. Without him, without the comrades around him who are loyal to the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people will lose their happiness.

The letter said, we, a group of Communists who support Mao Zedong Thought, extend our May Day greetings to the pure, brave, and hardworking Chinese people ten thousand times, wishing them to remain steadfastly united around the Chinese Communist Party, and around the Party Central Committee led by the wise commander and pure internationalist, Comrade Mao Zedong.

The letter warmly wrote: Comrades, we still keep the portrait of our leader Mao Zedong, so that every person who loves Mao Zedong can see it. Long live Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live Mao Zedong Thought! Glory forever belongs to Mao Zedong Thought!

The letter finally expressed the determination to bury imperialism and revisionism, and to eliminate them as thoroughly as weeds.

    新华社索非亚电　保加利亚一批共产党员在“五一”前夕，写信给以伟大的舵手毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，热情祝贺“五一”国际劳动节。
    贺信说，伟大的舵手毛泽东同志不仅领导着中国工人和农民群众前进，也领导着全世界一切被压迫人民和无产阶级前进。
    贺信说：全世界劳动者最伟大的节日——“五一”已经来临。过去，为了这个节日，成千上万的爱国战士在为无产阶级的搏斗中英勇地牺牲了，为此，我们活着的人一定要继承他们的事业，即使需要牺牲，我们也应当把生命献出来。贺信接着说：我们的眼光都注视着中国共产党。中国共产党是全世界最强大的党，她领导着消灭帝国主义的斗争，她在各方面受到先进的无产阶级的拥护。
    贺信说：中国人民应当感到最大的喜悦，因为他们有着一位智慧的、勇敢的、天才的统帅，经历了无数斗争烈火的最老的革命者毛泽东同志。为此，我们再重复一遍：一定要象保护自己的眼珠一样保卫我们的领袖毛泽东。如果没有他，没有他周围的忠于文化大革命的同志，中国人民就会失掉自己的幸福。
    贺信说，我们一批拥护毛泽东思想的共产党人千万次地向纯洁的、英勇的、勤劳的中国人民致以“五一”的敬礼，祝愿他们坚定不移地团结在中国共产党周围，团结在以英明的统帅、纯洁的国际主义者毛泽东同志为首的党中央的周围。
    贺信热情地写道：同志们，我们仍保存着我们的领袖毛泽东的像片，使每个热爱毛泽东的人都能看到。祝我们的毛泽东同志万寿无疆！毛泽东同志万岁！光荣永远属于毛泽东思想！
    贺信最后表示一定要埋葬帝国主义和修正主义，要象铲除杂草一样把它们清除干净。
