Young people in our country are filled with revolutionary enthusiasm. In the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the triumphant march of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they are celebrating their own fighting holiday—the May Fourth Youth Day.

In the history of the youth movement in our country, there has always been a sharp struggle between two lines. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has always insisted on the direction of uniting with workers and peasants. In 1939, Chairman Mao, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, published two brilliant works of historical significance, "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Direction of the Youth Movement," which are the highest summary of this proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao pointed out: "In the democratic revolution in China, the intellectuals are the first to awaken. However, if the intellectuals do not unite with the worker and peasant masses, they will achieve nothing. The final dividing line between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals is whether they are willing and able to unite with the worker and peasant masses." Chairman Mao sharply criticized the reactionary trend in the youth movement represented by Chen Duxiu and Zhang Guotao, pointing out the clear direction for the revolutionary youth movement in our country. However, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, who persist in the opportunist line, openly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Just two months after Chairman Mao's two brilliant works were published, they threw out their poisonous weed "Cultivation," urging youth to withdraw from the sharp national and class struggles of the time and engage in bourgeois individualist self-cultivation.

After the liberation of the whole country, Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the issue of intellectuals uniting with the worker and peasant masses. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Intellectuals, if they are to serve the worker and peasant masses, must first understand the workers and peasants, be familiar with their lives, work, and thoughts." He pointed out, "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and approaching the worker and peasant masses, can one truly learn." However, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party went even further in promoting their bourgeois reactionary line. They, together with a small clique of revisionists, long occupied our cultural and educational fronts, using every means to promote the educational "theories" and systems of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, attempting to cultivate the younger generation into bourgeois successors who are detached from reality, labor, the laboring people, and proletarian politics.

For seventeen years, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the younger generation has been particularly fierce and sharp.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of young revolutionary pioneers have emerged. They are a new generation nurtured and educated by the Party and Chairman Mao over a long period. They have inherited and carried forward the glorious tradition of revolutionary youth in our country since the May Fourth Movement and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have broken through the net of the revisionist educational line and bourgeois reactionary line promoted by a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, advancing in the direction of uniting with the worker and peasant masses. A large number of revolutionary students and revolutionary intellectuals have gone to the factories and countryside, working, studying, and making revolution together with the workers and peasants. In the great struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, they have not only made contributions to the seizure of power by the revolutionary factions of the proletariat but have also made significant progress in their own ideological transformation.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up the broadest path for the broad masses of intellectual youth to unite with the worker and peasant masses.

We must see that the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat over the younger generation, the struggle between the two lines in the youth movement, is a long-term and serious class struggle. For a revolutionary youth, uniting with the worker and peasant masses is a lifelong revolutionary direction to be persisted in, not a matter of a day or two. Intellectual youth can only temper and transform themselves in long-term mass struggles to cultivate themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Intellectuals, before they have merged with the revolutionary struggles of the masses and decided to serve the interests of the masses and unite with them, often have subjective and individualistic tendencies. Their thoughts are often empty, and their actions are often vacillating." The root cause of the individualism, sectarianism, small-groupism, and anarchism that currently exist in some revolutionary mass organizations lies in the fact that the worldview of these comrades has not been transformed. They need to undergo rigorous tempering in long-term mass struggles to truly unite with the worker and peasant masses.

All revolutionary intellectual youth must always remember that the laboring people are our mothers. They must respectfully and sincerely learn from the laboring people and serve them. They must learn the firm proletarian stand and deep proletarian feelings of the laboring people, learn their great ambition of "liberating all mankind to finally liberate themselves," enthusiastically help mistaken cadres and deceived masses to rise up in revolution; learn their hardworking, diligent, and simple style; learn their revolutionary qualities of being ruthless to the enemy and lenient to themselves; learn their high proletarian revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline; learn their revolutionary style of adhering to the truth, correcting errors, and daring to engage in self-criticism.

The great People's Liberation Army is the people's army from the worker and peasant masses, a peerless people's army personally led by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao. The excellent qualities of the worker and peasant masses are embodied in the People's Liberation Army. Revolutionary young people who insist on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line uniting with the worker and peasant masses and learning from them must firmly support the People's Liberation Army, strive to learn from the People's Liberation Army, and always stand shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart with the People's Liberation Army.

At present, for all revolutionary teachers and students, it is necessary to insist on the revolutionary direction of the youth movement pointed out by Chairman Mao, carry out a thorough criticism of the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the party, gradually complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in each school, and combine these well. Only in this way can we permanently end the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the educational field, fundamentally transform our schools; only in this way can we, according to Chairman Mao's educational policy, cultivate millions of intellectuals who unite with the worker and peasant masses, making our schools into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought like the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

All revolutionary young comrades, let us advance courageously along the path of intellectuals uniting with the worker and peasant masses as pointed out by Chairman Mao!

### 知识青年必须同工农相结合

    知识青年必须同工农相结合
    我国青年满怀着革命的豪情，在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线节节胜利的凯歌声中，欢庆自己战斗的节日——五四青年节。
    在我国青年运动史上，一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，始终坚持同工农相结合的大方向。一九三九年，毛主席为纪念五四运动二十周年发表的《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》两篇具有光辉历史意义的著作，就是对这条无产阶级革命路线最高度的概括。毛主席指出：“在中国的民主革命运动中，知识分子是首先觉悟的成份。”“然而知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”毛主席尖锐地批判了以陈独秀、张国焘为代表的青年运动中的逆流，为我国革命的青年运动指出了明确的方向。然而，坚持机会主义路线的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，公然与毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗，在毛主席的两篇光辉著作刚刚发表后两个月，就抛出他的大毒草《修养》，要青年离开当时尖锐的民族斗争和阶级斗争，而去作资产阶级个人主义的修身养性。
    全国解放以后，毛主席又一再强调了知识分子必须同工农群众相结合的问题。毛主席指出：“知识分子既然要为工农群众服务，那就首先必须懂得工人农民，熟悉他们的生活、工作和思想。”他指出，“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”然而，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，却变本加厉地推行他的资产阶级反动路线。他伙同一小撮修正主义分子，长期盘踞我们的文化和教育阵地，千方百计地推行美帝和苏修的一套教育“理论”和制度，妄图把青年一代培养成为脱离实际、脱离劳动、脱离劳动人民、脱离无产阶级政治的资产阶级接班人。
    十七年来，在无产阶级和资产阶级争夺青年一代的问题上，两条路线的斗争显得特别激烈、特别尖锐。
    在这次无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的大批年青的革命闯将，是在党和毛主席长期培养哺育下成长起来的崭新的一代。他们继承和发扬了五四以来我国革命青年的光荣传统，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们冲决了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的修正主义教育路线和资产阶级反动路线的罗网，朝着与工农群众相结合的方向前进。大批的革命学生和革命知识分子下厂下乡，和工人农民一起劳动、一起学习、一起干革命。他们在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，不仅为实现无产阶级革命派的联合夺权作出了贡献，而且也在自己思想的改造上取得了很大的收获。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，为广大的知识青年与工农群众相结合开辟了最广阔的道路。
    我们必须看到，资产阶级和无产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争，在青年运动中两条路线的斗争，是一场长期的严重的阶级斗争。对于一个革命的青年来说，和工农群众相结合，这是要一辈子坚持奋斗的革命方向，而决不是一朝一夕的事情。知识青年只有在长期的群众斗争中锻炼改造自己，才能把自己培养成为坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    毛主席指出：“知识分子在其未和群众的革命斗争打成一片，在其未下决心为群众利益服务并与群众相结合的时候，往往带有主观主义和个人主义的倾向，他们的思想往往是空虚的，他们的行动往往是动摇的。”目前某些革命群众组织中存在的个人主义，风头主义，小团体主义和无政府主义等非无产阶级思想，根本原因正在于这些同志的世界观还没有改造好。他们还需要在长期的群众斗争中经受艰苦的磨炼，使自己真正同工农群众紧密地结合起来。
    一切革命的知识青年，都必须时刻记住劳动人民是我们的母亲。恭恭敬敬，诚诚恳恳地向劳动人民学习，为劳动人民服务。要学习他们坚定的无产阶级立场和深厚的无产阶级感情，学习他们“只有解放全人类才能最后解放自己”的伟大气魄，热情地帮助犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众起来革命；学习他们艰苦奋斗，勤劳朴实的作风；学习他们对敌狠、对己和的革命品质；学习他们高度的无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性；学习他们坚持真理，修正错误，勇于自我批评的革命风格。
    伟大的人民解放军，是来自工农群众的人民子弟兵，是毛主席亲手缔造和林彪同志亲自领导的举世无双的人民军队。在人民解放军身上，体现了工农群众的优秀品质。坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命青少年同工农群众结合，向工农群众学习，就要坚决拥护人民解放军，努力学习人民解放军，永远和人民解放军肩并肩，心连心。
    在当前，对于广大革命师生来说，必须坚持毛主席所指出的青年运动的革命方向，开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，逐步完成各个学校的斗、批、改的任务，并且把这些很好地结合起来。只有这样，才能永远结束资产阶级知识分子对教育领域的统治，使我们的学校从根本上得到改造；才能按照毛主席的教育方针，培养千百万与工农群众相结合的无产阶级知识分子，使我们的学校成为“抗大”那样的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    一切革命的青年同志们，让我们沿着毛主席指出的知识分子同工农群众相结合的道路奋勇前进！
