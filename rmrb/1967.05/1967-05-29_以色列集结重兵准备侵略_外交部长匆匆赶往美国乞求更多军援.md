Israel, the tool of American imperialism, is ignoring the opposition of Arab countries and, with the support of its master, is hurriedly gathering troops and massing them on the borders of Arab countries, preparing to launch an invasion.

According to the Egyptian newspaper *Al-Ahram*, out of Israel's current 112,000 troops, 18 brigades totaling 72,000 soldiers are massed on the Egyptian border, 4 brigades are on the Syrian border, and 6 brigades are held in reserve. It is reported that Israel has completed its "general mobilization."

The newspaper also said that Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban recently rushed to Washington to request more military aid from the United States. For many years, the United States has been providing Israel with large amounts of military aid to incite it against Arab countries. Just in recent years, the United States has given Israel three batches of weapons, including "Hawk" missiles, new fighter jets, and 200 Patton tanks.

    新华社二十八日讯　美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列不顾阿拉伯国家的反对，正在它的主子支持下加紧集结军队，陈兵阿拉伯国家边境，准备发动侵略战争。
    据阿联《金字塔报》揭露，以色列现有的十一万二千名军队中，共有十八个旅的七万二千人集结在阿联边境，四个旅集结在叙利亚边境，六个旅作为后备队。据报道，以色列最近已经完成了“总动员”。
    这家报纸还说，以色列外交部长埃班最近匆匆去华盛顿，是为了要求美国提供更多军事援助。多年来，美国为了怂恿以色列反对阿拉伯国家，一直在给以色列大量军事援助。单是最近几年，美国就给以色列三批武器，包括“隼式”导弹，新式战斗机和二百辆巴顿式坦克。
