	New China News Agency, May 15th: Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo summoned British Charge d'Affaires Hopkins early this morning to hand over a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lodging the most urgent and strongest protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities against Hong Kong Chinese workers and residents. The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
	May 15, 1967

	On the afternoon of May 6, 1967, Chinese workers at the artificial plastic flower factory in Hong Kong's San Po Kong staged a struggle against the exploitation of the management. The Hong Kong British authorities protected the management and suppressed the workers, mobilizing more than 200 armed police and "riot control" forces to brutally suppress the workers and other Chinese residents of the factory that day, injuring many and arresting 21 people. Later, they also arrested the chairman of the Rubber and Plastic Workers' Union and worker representatives who went to the Hong Kong police station to protest. On the afternoon of the 11th, the Hong Kong British authorities again mobilized thousands of armed police and "riot control" forces, repeatedly using batons, riot guns, tear gas, and even military vehicles and helicopters to brutally suppress the unarmed workers, representatives from various sectors, and young students on a larger scale, arresting many people (including film cameramen and reporters). After the 12th, the Hong Kong British authorities continued to arrest demonstrators in large numbers, reaching more than 400 by the morning of the 14th. The situation is still developing and expanding.

	It must be pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' creation of this large-scale bloody atrocity is the result of long-term preparation and is part of the British government's conspiracy with US imperialism against China. On the one hand, the British government, in collusion with the US in escalating the war in Vietnam, ignores the Chinese government's repeated serious warnings and continues to use Hong Kong as a base for US aggression in Vietnam. On the other hand, it continuously implements various anti-China measures in Hong Kong. Especially since the launch of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Hong Kong British authorities have repeatedly held military and police exercises aimed at China, intending to brutally suppress Hong Kong Chinese residents and, with high-pressure tactics, resist the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This time, the Hong Kong British authorities used the labor dispute at the artificial plastic flower factory to persecute Chinese residents and workers, exposing their evil plan of bloody suppression. The fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities have aroused the extreme anger of Hong Kong Chinese residents and all Chinese people. The Chinese government strongly protests against the British government for this.

	The bloody atrocities created by the Hong Kong British authorities show that they are extremely fearful and hateful of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This unprecedented great revolutionary movement has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, completely shattering their dream of achieving a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration in China, and greatly inspiring and promoting the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. This great revolutionary movement, in particular, has made Hong Kong Chinese compatriots love Mao Zedong Thought even more, and they are striving to carry out the movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The broad patriotic compatriots, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have an unprecedentedly high spirit of anti-imperialism. The Hong Kong British authorities are in a state of panic and attempt to use violence to suppress the influence of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to maintain their control, thus creating this savage fascist atrocity.

	The Chinese government solemnly warns the British government: you have completely miscalculated and chosen the wrong target. The Hong Kong Chinese workers and residents, who have inherited the glorious tradition of anti-imperialist struggle for more than a hundred years and are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be frightened or crushed. In their struggle against the atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities, they have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, determined not to be afraid of sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory. They are heroic and unyielding, fully carrying forward the glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism, and are worthy sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. The Hong Kong British authorities are snarling and menacing, but as China's great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "All the oppression that the reactionaries impose on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only serve to promote the more extensive and more intense revolutionary struggle of the people." The Hong Kong British authorities' bloody suppression of Chinese residents will only result in "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet."

	The Chinese government solemnly declares: The Chinese government and 700 million Chinese people firmly support the heroic and just struggle of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots and will resolutely be their powerful backing. The Chinese government solemnly demands that the British government order the Hong Kong British authorities to:

	Immediately accept all legitimate demands of Hong Kong Chinese workers and residents;
	Immediately stop all fascist measures;
	Immediately release all detained individuals (including workers, reporters, cameramen, etc.);
	Punish the perpetrators of this bloody atrocity, apologize to the victims, and compensate for all losses;
	Ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

	The British government and the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately and unconditionally accept the above solemn demands of the Chinese government. The Chinese government and people are determined to see this struggle through to the end. If the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities insist on their course, then all serious consequences must be borne by the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities.

    香港英国当局勾结美帝猖狂反华，血腥镇压香港中国同胞
    我国政府向英国政府提出最紧急最强烈抗议
    我外交部发表声明指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国工人和居民，是吓不倒、压不垮的。
    中国政府和七亿人民坚决支持香港中国同胞英勇、正义的斗争，誓做他们的强大后盾。决心把这场斗争进行到底。
    新华社十五日讯　我国外交部副部长罗贵波今天清晨召见英国驻华代办霍普森，面交我国外交部声明，最紧急、最强烈抗议香港英国当局对香港中国工人和居民的法西斯暴行。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部声明
    一九六七年五月十五日
    一九六七年五月六日下午，香港新蒲岗人造塑胶花工厂中国工人，为反对资方加强剥削，进行了斗争。香港英国当局包庇资方，压制工人，竟然出动了二百余名武装警察和“防暴队”，对该厂工人和其他中国居
  民，进行了血腥镇压，当天殴伤多人，拘捕二十一人。事后，又对前往香港警署抗议的树胶塑胶工会主席和工人代表，进行了拘捕。十一日下午，香港英国当局再度出动大批武装军警和“防暴队”千余人，连续多次使用警棍、防暴枪、催泪弹，并且开来军车和直升飞机，对赤手空拳的工人、各界代表和青年学生进行更大规模的血腥镇压，逮捕了很多人（包括电影摄影师、记者等）。十二日以后，香港英国当局还继续大量逮捕示威群众，截至十四日晨已达四百余人。目前，事态还在继续发展和扩大。
    必须指出，香港英国当局制造这次大规模的血腥暴行，是经过长期准备的，是英国政府勾结美帝国主义反对中国的阴谋的一部分。英国政府一方面配合美帝在越南的战争升级，漠视中国政府的多次严正警告，继续把香港作为美国侵越的基地；另一方面又不断在香港加强敌视中国的种种措施。特别是在我国无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，香港英国当局曾多次举行敌视中国的军警演习，旨在对香港中国居民进行血腥镇压，妄图以高压手段抵制我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大影响。这次香港英国当局利用人造塑胶花工厂劳资纠纷，对中国居民和工人进行迫害，就是这种血腥镇压的罪恶计划的一次大暴露。香港英国当局的法西斯暴行，已经激起了香港中国居民和全中国人民的无比愤怒。中国政府就此对英国政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。
    香港英国当局一手制造的血腥暴行，说明他们对于中国的无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要命，恨得要死。这个史无前例的伟大的革命运动沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，彻底地粉碎了它们企图在中国实现资本主义反革命复辟的梦想，大大地鼓舞和推动了全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争。这个伟大的革命运动，特别使香港中国同胞更加热爱毛泽东思想，他们努力地开展活学活用毛主席著作的运动。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大爱国同胞，反帝斗志空前昂扬。香港英国当局对此惊慌失措，妄想使用暴力镇压来遏制毛泽东思想的影响，继续维护他们的控制，因而制造了这次野蛮的法西斯暴行。
    中国政府要严正警告英国政府，你们这样做，完全打错了算盘，找错了对象。继承了一百多年反帝斗争光荣传统，并且用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国工人和居民，是吓不倒、压不垮的。他们这次在反对香港英国当局暴行的斗争中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们英勇顽强，坚贞不屈，大大地发扬了反帝爱国的光荣传统，不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女。香港英国当局张牙舞爪，气势汹汹，但是，正如中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”香港英国当局对于中国居民的血腥镇压，只会得到“搬起石头打自己的脚”的结果。
    中国政府庄严宣告：中国政府和七亿中国人民坚决支持香港中国同胞的英勇、正义的斗争，并且坚决做他们的强大后盾。中国政府严正要求英国政府责成香港英国当局：
    立即接受香港中国工人和居民的全部正当要求；
    立即停止一切法西斯措施；
    立即释放全体被捕人员（包括工人、记者、摄影师等）；
    惩办这一血腥暴行的凶手，向受害者道歉，并赔偿一切损失；
    保证不再发生类此事件。
    英国政府和香港英国当局必须立即无条件地接受中国政府的上述严正要求。中国政府和中国人民决心把这场斗争进行到底。如果英国政府和香港英国当局一意孤行，那么一切严重后果必须由英国政府和香港英国当局承担。
