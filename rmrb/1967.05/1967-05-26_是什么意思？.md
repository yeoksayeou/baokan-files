Title: What Does It Mean?

In 1950, the second year of the founding of the People's Republic of China under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the reactionary films "The Last Emperor" and "The Life of Wu Xun" were screened in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. These two reactionary films are like two poisonous gourds on the same black vine. "The Last Emperor" advocates treachery; "The Life of Wu Xun" advocates slavery.

Wu Xun was a loyal servant of the feudal ruling class of the Qing Dynasty. This person was utterly shameless and disgusting, bowing and scraping, wagging his tail for favors!

This Wu Xun is indeed not worth emulating. As early as 1936, the great Lu Xun, whom Chairman Mao praised for having "not an iota of servility or obsequiousness," sharply criticized this slave-like clown in a short piece titled "A Difficult Question."

The text is not long, and it is quoted in full below:

    For some reason, perhaps because of having passed through "childhood," in recent years there have been many publications aimed at children, filled with admonitions, guidance, encouragement, and exhortations. If someone with less vigor than a child were to read them, they would likely become dizzy.

    Recently, on February 9, the "Children's Supplement" of the *Shenbao* published an article about "Mr. Wu Xun" for children. It says he was a beggar who ate rotten food, drank dirty water, and did hard labor for others. "When he earned money, he would save it. If someone gave him money, he would even kneel down."

    This is not particularly unusual. What is unusual is that after he got money, he did not spend a single cent, eventually managing to open a school.

    Thus, the author of "Mr. Wu Xun" poses a question:
    "Little friends! After reading the above story, what do you think?"

    I am truly curious to know what thoughts the little friends will have. If the person who read the above story is a beggar, or someone in an even worse situation, then he might feel ashamed or indignant that China has so few beggars like this. But what will the little friends think? They might just stare with wide eyes and ask the author:
    "Big friend! What do you mean by telling us the above story?"

    "What do you mean?"—this question is well asked!

    After the screening of the slavish "The Life of Wu Xun," some self-proclaimed Marxists among the Communist Party members enthusiastically praised it. "What do you mean?"

    More than ten years have passed, especially through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the answer has become even clearer! Those self-proclaimed Marxists in the Communist Party are actually counter-revolutionary revisionists. They wanted to release "The Life of Wu Xun" and praise it. In a word, as Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'," they tried "to make every effort to preserve the old things and prevent them from dying," attempting to achieve a capitalist restoration in New China.

    “是什么意思？”
    辛午
    一九五○年，也就是无产阶级专政的新中国成立的第二年，反动影片《清宫秘史》和《武训传》，先后在北京、上海等地上映。这两部反动影片，是一根黑藤上的两个毒瓜。《清宫秘史》，宣扬卖国主义；《武训传》，宣扬奴隶主义。
    武训，是清朝封建统治阶级的一个忠实奴才。此人奴颜婢膝，摇尾乞怜，无耻之极，丑恶透顶！
    这个武训，实在不足为训。被毛主席称赞为“没有丝毫的奴颜和媚骨”的伟大的鲁迅，早在一九三六年，就在一篇题为《难答的问题》的短文中，尖锐地批判了这个奴气十足的小丑。全文不长，照录如下：
    大约是因为经过了“儿童年”的缘故罢，这几年来，向儿童们说话的刊物多得很，教训呀，指导呀，鼓励呀，劝谕呀，七嘴八舌，如果精力的旺盛不及儿童的人，是看了要头昏的。
    最近，二月九日《申报》的《儿童专刊》上，有一篇文章在对儿童讲《武训先生》。它说他是一个乞丐，自己吃臭饭，喝脏水，给人家做苦工，“做得了钱，却把它储起来。只要有人给他钱，甚至他可以跪下来的”。
    这并不算什么特别。特别的是他得了钱，却一文也不化，终至于开办了一个学校。
    于是这篇《武训先生》的作者提出一个问题来道：
    “小朋友！你念了上面的故事，有什么感想？”
    我真也极愿意知道小朋友将有怎样的感想。假如念了上面的故事的人，是一个乞丐，或者比乞丐景况还要好，那么，他大约要自愧弗如，或者愤慨于中国少有这样的乞丐。然而小朋友会怎样感想呢，他们恐怕只好圆睁了眼睛，回问作者道：
    “大朋友！你讲了上面的故事，是什么意思？”
    “是什么意思？”——这个问题提得好！
    奴隶主义的《武训传》放映以后，一些号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员，竭力加以吹捧，“是什么意思？”
    时间过去了十多年，特别是通过这次无产阶级文化大革命，答案就更加清楚了！那些号称学得马克思主义的共产党员，其实就是一些反革命修正主义分子。他们所以要让《武训传》出笼，所以要吹捧《武训传》，一句话，就是毛主席在《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》中所指出的：他们想“以种种努力去保持旧事物使它得免于死亡”，妄图在新中国实现资本主义复辟。
