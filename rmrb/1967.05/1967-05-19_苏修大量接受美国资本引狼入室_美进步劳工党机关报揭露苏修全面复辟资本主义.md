The organ of the Progressive Labor Party of the United States, the "Challenge" newspaper, recently exposed that the Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to fully restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, is actively inviting capital from the United States and Western European countries into the Soviet Union.

In an article, the "Challenge" newspaper pointed out that the Soviet revisionists are busy negotiating with Western capitalists, signing contracts for them to build factories in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionists' recent negotiations with the Italian Fiat Company on a deal for this company to build a small car factory in the Soviet Union is, in fact, a deal with the United States. The article pointed out that a bill currently being discussed in the U.S. Congress, which is supported by the U.S. government, authorizes the U.S. government to provide $50 million in loans to this Italian company to purchase the necessary machinery from the United States for building the factory in the Soviet Union. This confirms that the United States is involved in this Fiat Company deal.

The article states that a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, when passing this bill, submitted a report saying that the U.S. Department of Defense, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, believes that this deal "is in our (the United States') national interest." The Central Intelligence Agency also supports taking this action because it "is mainly for the production of small cars for the use of (Soviet) bureaucrats and high-level enterprise managers, rather than for the general public."

The article continues, "The American Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce is also cheering for this matter and is demanding further promotion of trade relations between the United States and the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, and is demanding that government guarantees and loans be used to encourage American companies to build factories in these countries."

The article believes that the Soviet revisionists' eagerness to allow Western countries to build factories in the Soviet Union, especially factories producing consumer goods, is ultimately aimed at fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The article also states: "Yugoslavia is drafting new laws to encourage direct private investment from abroad, allowing foreign investors to send their own experts to the factories and to have 'a say' in management. This probably indicates what will happen next in the Soviet Union."

### 苏修大量接受美国资本引狼入室  美进步劳工党机关报揭露苏修全面复辟资本主义

    苏修大量接受美国资本引狼入室
    美进步劳工党机关报揭露苏修全面复辟资本主义
    新华社伦敦十五日电　美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》报最近一期揭露，苏联修正主义领导集团为了在苏联全面复辟资本主义，正在把美国和西欧国家的资本主义大量引进苏联。
    《挑战》报在一篇文章中指出，苏修正忙于同西方资本家谈判，订立由他们在苏联建厂的合同；苏修最近同意大利菲亚特公司谈判的一项由这家公司在苏联建造一座生产小轿车的汽车厂的生意，实际上是一笔同美国做的生意。文章指出，现在在美国国会讨论的一项为美国政府所赞同的法案，授权美国政府为这家意大利公司提供五千万美元的贷款，以便从美国购买在苏联建厂所需的工作母机。这就证实，美国参与了菲亚特公司的这笔生意。
    文章说，美国众议院一个小组委员会在通过这项法案时提出报告说，美国国防部，包括参谋长联席会议，认为这笔生意“符合我们（美国）的国家利益”。美国中央情报局也赞成采取这个行动，因为这“主要是为了生产小汽车，供（苏联）官僚和企业管理阶层的高级人士、而不是供一般公民享用的”。
    文章接着说，国际商会美国委员会也为这件事欢呼，并且要求进一步促进美国同苏联和一些东欧国家的贸易关系，要求用政府担保和贷款的办法来鼓励美国公司在这些国家建厂。
    文章认为，苏修如此急于让西方国家在苏联建厂，特别是生产消费品的工厂，总的目的当然是为了在苏联全面复辟资本主义。
    文章还说：“南斯拉夫正在起草新的法律，鼓励来自外国的私人直接投资，允许外国投资者派遣他们自己的专家到工厂里来，并且在管理上有‘发言权’，这大概说明了在苏联下一步会发生什么情况。”
