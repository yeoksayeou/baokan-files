Vietnamese military and civilians in the north and south launched a coordinated attack, bombarding U.S. bases with tens of thousands of shells. They destroyed two U.S. bases south of the demilitarized zone and shot down nearly a hundred U.S. aircraft. Over the past few days, the Vietnamese military and air force have shot down nine invading U.S. planes.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, local newspapers reported: The artillery unit of the Vietnamese People's Army in the Vinh Linh area, to severely punish the American aggressors who have committed heinous crimes in both North and South Vietnam, on the afternoon of the 27th, again shelled the U.S. base in the Yu Temple area south of the demilitarized zone. Under the fierce bombardment, the entire base turned into a sea of fire, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

At 4 p.m. on the 27th, when the U.S. aggressors were concentrated in the base, the artillery unit of the Vinh Linh garrison, in close coordination with the local people, launched a barrage of shells, striking the U.S. aggressors with fierce and accurate artillery fire. The base's cannons were immediately rendered useless, the ammunition depot and fuel storage were destroyed, and the flames soared. Many tanks, armored vehicles, and cannons were blown into piles of scrap metal. The base's communication system was also destroyed.

In this battle, a total of more than 300 enemy personnel were eliminated, including 250 U.S. aggressors. Eleven cannons were destroyed, including three 175mm long-range cannons. Twenty helicopters and fifteen vehicles of various types were destroyed, including two tanks. Two ammunition depots and two fuel storage facilities were hit and burned.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 2nd: According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, on the night of April 27th, the liberation forces of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce artillery attack on the Dong Ha enemy base. According to preliminary reports, nearly 400 enemy personnel were eliminated, including 280 U.S. aggressors. Seventy-one aircraft of various types were destroyed; almost all the cannons in the base were destroyed, and two radar stations were completely demolished.

The Dong Ha base is an important operational base for the U.S. aggressors to conduct large-scale "sweeping" operations south of the demilitarized zone. This base is garrisoned by the U.S. Marine Corps' combat units and some main forces of the puppet army, and it is equipped with many U.S. helicopters and C-130 large transport planes. On the night of the 27th, the liberation forces of Quang Tri Province, to punish the madly escalating war of the U.S. aggressors, to avenge the compatriots killed by the enemy in Hanoi, Haiphong, and North and South Vietnam, cleverly approached this base and launched a sudden attack with fierce artillery fire. After the battle began, hundreds of revenge shells accurately hit the U.S. and puppet army's division and regiment command posts, U.S. Air Force officers' quarters, and the central area of Dong Ha and two U.S. artillery positions in the southwest, as well as the communication system and two radar stations. At the same time, another unit of the liberation forces fiercely shelled the enemy's ammunition depot and fuel storage, and eliminated the enemy in the puppet army's first division headquarters and the second regiment command post in this area.

The liberation forces' lightning-fast and fierce offensive caught the U.S. aggressors and puppet army off guard, rendering their cannons useless, and the base was filled with cries of despair. The entire Dong Ha base turned into a sea of fire, and the flames from the fuel storage and ammunition depot burned until the 28th.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 1st: It was announced here on the evening of the 1st that U.S. aggressor planes attacked some residential areas in the provinces of Bac Ninh and Bac Ninh and invaded the airspace of Thanh Hoa Province on May 1st. The Vietnamese People's Air Force and the military and civilians of the above-mentioned areas, with a resolute spirit of decisive battle and victory, fought bravely and shot down four U.S. jet planes.

According to additional reports, the Vietnamese People's Air Force shot down five U.S. planes in the skies over the provinces of Quang Ninh, Nghia Lo, and Phu Tho on April 30th.

    据新华社河内电　据此间报纸报道：越南北方永灵区人民军某部炮兵，为了严厉惩罚在越南南北两方犯下滔天罪行的美国侵略强盗，二十七日下午又炮轰非军事区以南育庙地区的美军基地。在猛烈炮火轰击下，整个基地变成一片火海，使敌人遭到了严重损失。
    二十七日下午四时正，正当美国侵略军集中在基地里的时候，永灵区驻军某部炮兵在当地人民的紧密配合下，万炮齐鸣，以猛烈而准确的炮火轰向美国侵略军头上，基地里的大炮一开始便被打得完全瘫痪，军火库和汽油库被摧毁，烈火冲天。许多坦克、装甲车和大炮被炸成一堆堆废铁。基地里的通讯系统也被炸毁。

    解放武装力量迅雷不及掩耳的猛烈攻势，打得美国侵略军和伪军蒙头转向、措手不及，大炮变成了哑吧，基地里叫哭连天。整个东河基地变成一片火海，汽油库和弹药库的熊熊烈火一直燃烧到二十八日。
    据新华社河内一日电　据这里一日晚上公布，美国强盗飞机五月一日袭击河北、河南两省的一些居民区并入侵河静省上空，越南人民军空军部队和上述地区军民大力发扬决战决胜精神，进行了英勇的战斗，共击落美国喷气式飞机四架。
