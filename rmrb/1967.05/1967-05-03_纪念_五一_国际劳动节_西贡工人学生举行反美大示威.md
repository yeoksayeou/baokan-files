Workers and students in Saigon, defying the suppression by the U.S.-puppet regime, held large-scale demonstrations and rallies on May 1st, International Labor Day.

According to reports from Western news agencies, on May 1st, workers and students in Saigon broke through the blockade of puppet military and police in several places to hold demonstrations and rallies. The demonstrators carried banners opposing U.S. imperialism and the Nguyen Cao Ky regime. Giant red anti-American slogans appeared on the streets of Saigon, denouncing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam. About three thousand workers marched to the "office" of the puppet leader Nguyen Cao Ky to protest, encountering clashes with puppet police along the way. Several hundred students also clashed with puppet police who tried to block their demonstration.

The U.S.-puppet regime is terrified of the anti-American actions by Saigon workers and students. Days before May 1st, the puppet authorities had ordered a ban on demonstrations and parades. On May 1st, the U.S.-puppet regime was on high alert, deploying ten thousand police in layers of defense, and ordering three battalions of armed police to "maintain vigilance." They were particularly afraid of attacks on the U.S. "Embassy," dispatching a large number of puppet police to "protect" this den of American bandits.

    纪念“五一”国际劳动节
    西贡工人学生举行反美大示威
    新华社二日讯　西贡消息：西贡的工人和学生，不顾美伪集团的镇压，在“五一”国际劳动节举行了大规模的示威游行。
    据西方通讯社报道，“五一”这一天，西贡的工人和学生在好几个地方冲破傀儡军警的封锁，举行了示威和集会。示威群众举着反对美帝国主义和阮高其集团的旗帜，西贡大街上也出现了巨幅的红字反美标语，谴责美帝国主义侵略越南。有三千名工人前往傀儡头子阮高其的“办公处”示威，在途中和伪警察发生冲突。几百名学生也同阻拦他们示威的伪警察发生了冲突。
    美伪集团对西贡工人和学生的反美行动怕得要命。早在几天以前，傀儡当局就下令禁止在“五一”举行示威游行。“五一”当天，美伪集团如临大敌，出动了一万名警察层层设防，并且下令三营武装警察“保持戒备”。他们特别害怕美国“大使馆”挨揍，增派了大批伪警察去“保护”这个美国强盗的巢穴。
