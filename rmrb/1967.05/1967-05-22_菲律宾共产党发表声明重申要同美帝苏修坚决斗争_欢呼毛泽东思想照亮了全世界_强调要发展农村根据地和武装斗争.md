The Communist Party of the Philippines issued a statement on May 1st, International Labor Day, asserting that the highest development of Marxism-Leninism in the era of world socialist revolution, Mao Zedong Thought, illuminates the entire world.

The statement reaffirmed the Party's opposition to U.S. imperialism and its reactionary allies within the Philippines; opposition to modern revisionism and all forms of opportunism; unity with all Marxist-Leninist parties; and the implementation of a united front policy internationally.

The statement said, the Communist Party of the Philippines is determined to engage in a life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism and its local reactionary allies—the comprador bourgeoisie and landlords. Since 1898, when U.S. imperialism seized sovereignty over the Philippines, the Philippines has long been a major base for U.S. imperialism in Asia, serving as a springboard for U.S. aggression against China and the entire Southeast Asia and Asia. Driving out U.S. imperialist forces from the Philippines is an inescapable responsibility of the Filipino people under the leadership of the working class and its party. While waging anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles, the Communist Party of the Philippines is also conducting nationwide party-building efforts, developing rural base areas, and armed struggle, and promoting a national united front under the leadership of the working class.

The statement said, the Communist Party of the Philippines is determined to engage in an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist leadership. There is no middle ground between modern revisionism and the proletarian revolutionary line. The illegal status of the Communist Party of the Philippines clearly shows that there is no other path to national and social liberation except armed struggle. The statement said, the Communist Party of the Philippines is determined to maintain the strongest fraternal unity with all Marxist-Leninist parties. In this regard, the highest development of Marxism-Leninism in the era of world socialist revolution, the thought of Comrade Mao Zedong, illuminates the entire world.

The statement concluded by saying, the Communist Party of the Philippines will implement the policy of an international united front under the leadership of the international proletariat, firmly directing its main target at U.S. imperialism. It rejects the so-called "joint action" slogan proposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership. This slogan is a cunning trick aimed at luring the world's working class into a trap of collusion with U.S. imperialism.

    菲律宾共产党发表声明重申要同美帝苏修坚决斗争
    欢呼毛泽东思想照亮了全世界
    强调要发展农村根据地和武装斗争
    新华社二十一日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾共产党政治局在今年“五一”国际劳动节的时候发表声明指出，世界社会主义革命时代的马克思列宁主义最高发展的毛泽东思想，照亮了全世界。
    声明重申菲共反对美帝国主义以及它在菲律宾国内的反动同盟者；反对现代修正主义和一切形式的机会主义；团结所有的马克思列宁主义政党；执行国际统一战线政策。
    声明说，菲共誓同美帝国主义以及它在本地的反动同盟者——买办资本家和地主进行你死我活的斗争。自一八九八年美帝国主义侵占菲律宾主权以来，菲律宾长期是美帝国主义在亚洲的一个强大基地，是美国侵略中国、侵略整个东南亚和亚洲的跳板。把美帝国主义的势力赶出菲律宾，是在工人阶级及其政党领导下的菲律宾人民的不可推卸的职责。菲律宾共产党在进行反帝反封建斗争的同时，正在重新进行全国范围的建党，发展农村根据地和武装斗争，开展在工人阶级领导下的民族统一战线。
    声明说，菲共誓同以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义进行不调和的斗争。在现代修正主义和无产阶级革命路线之间没有中间道路。菲律宾共产党的非法状态清楚地表明，除了武装斗争，没有其他走向民族和社会解放的道路。声明说，菲共誓同所有的马克思列宁主义政党保持最坚强的兄弟团结。在这方面，世界社会主义革命时代的马克思列宁主义最高发展的毛泽东同志的思想照亮了全世界。
    声明最后说，菲共保证执行国际无产阶级领导下的国际统一战线政策，坚决地把它的主要矛头指向美帝国主义。它拒绝苏修领导集团提出的所谓“联合行动”口号。这个口号是企图诱使全世界工人阶级落入同美帝国主义勾结的圈套的一个狡猾的阴谋诡计。
