With Great Leader Chairman Mao's support and seven hundred million people as a strong backing, Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots resolve to carry on the struggle against oppression to the end. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots' Committee Against British Oppression is established.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 17th - In response to the call from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, over one hundred representatives from various sectors in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a meeting at the Workers' Club of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions in the morning of the 16th. They solemnly announced the establishment of the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots' Committee Against British Oppression" and unanimously passed a protest letter against the fascist oppression by the British authorities in Hong Kong. The representatives firmly declared that no matter how severe the British authorities' bloody suppression is, and no matter how long it takes, we will see it through to the end.

The meeting was presided over by Yang Guang, the Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions. The representatives present were full of fighting spirit. They wore shining Chairman Mao badges and held copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." At the beginning of the meeting, everyone read aloud the quotations from Chairman Mao: "All reactionaries are paper tigers" and "Resolutely take a stand, do not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory."

In their speeches, the representatives strongly supported the statement issued by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 15th and vehemently protested against the heinous crimes committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong against Chinese compatriots. They pointed out that the struggle against oppression by the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon is a struggle to defend Mao Zedong Thought, a struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries united in opposing China, and a struggle to defend the dignity of the Chinese people. The British authorities' frenzied oppression can only make the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon more united and their struggle more resolute, making the invincible Mao Zedong Thought shine even brighter in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The protest letter unanimously passed by the meeting stated that the statement by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the most affectionate concern of our most beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao for the people of Hong Kong and expresses the determination of the Chinese government and seven hundred million Chinese people to support the struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against oppression. The protest letter strongly protests and makes four serious demands to the British authorities: first, immediately stop all illegal arrests, interrogations, convictions, beatings, and other fascist bloody suppression actions; second, immediately announce the acquittal and release of all arrested patriots; third, severely punish the perpetrators of this bloody violence, apologize to the victims, and compensate for all their losses; fourth, ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

The protest letter sternly warned the British authorities: "You must immediately and unconditionally accept our four demands and the five demands of the Chinese government, otherwise, all serious consequences will be borne by the British authorities."

The protest letter finally emphasized: Our struggle against British oppression is just. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible. We have Great Leader Chairman Mao's support and seven hundred million great Chinese people as a strong backing. We are determined to carry on this struggle against oppression to the end, and we will surely achieve the final victory.
