New China News Agency, Tokyo, May 1 — On the eve of May Day, the International Labor Day, many Japanese workers spoke to Chinese journalists, enthusiastically praising the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They celebrated the brilliant victory of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

They pointed out that this year's May Day comes under the radiant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought shining all over the world. These Japanese workers have deep feelings for Chairman Mao and an infinite love for Mao Zedong Thought. They pointed out that Mao Zedong Thought has shown the Japanese working people the direction of struggle and given them boundless courage. A worker who persistently studies Chairman Mao's works excitedly said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism shining all over the world; Mao Zedong Thought is our weapon of struggle. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can unite the people and strike down the enemy." He emotionally said, "I deeply love Chairman Mao, I shout long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

A worker in an instrument manufacturing factory said passionately, to welcome May Day, he and his friends made a giant portrait of Chairman Mao, planning to carry it at the front of the parade to express the Japanese working people's boundless love for Chairman Mao.

Japanese workers also pointed out that this year's May Day comes amidst the triumphant voice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has shaken the world. They enthusiastically praised the unprecedented great cause personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They pointed out that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has solved the problem of how the proletariat, after seizing power, can ensure that the dictatorship of the proletariat does not change color. It has prevented the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China. It has set a brilliant example for the revolutionary people of all countries.

They praised China, through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the most reliable revolutionary base for the people of the world and a more solid fortress for world revolution. An instrument manufacturing worker expressed his warm congratulations on the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality. He said that the Japanese people who are in the midst of struggle should learn well from the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people and strive even harder, resolutely fighting against modern revisionists.

Japanese workers also angrily denounced the recent frenzied expansion of the Vietnam War by U.S. imperialism. They severely condemned Soviet modern revisionism for acting as a shameful accomplice to U.S. aggression against Vietnam and serving the "peace talks" conspiracy plotted by U.S. imperialism.

A railway worker said, "We ordinary workers know that the Soviet revisionists are colluding with U.S. imperialism." An employee pointed out that waging an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism is a powerful aid to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national liberation. They unanimously condemned the despicable acts of Japanese Communist Party revisionists who engage in false anti-American and true anti-Chinese schemes.

When talking about the current struggle of the Japanese working class and their prospects for the future, they expressed that they must clearly identify who their enemies and friends are, and strengthen the study of Mao Zedong Thought to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. A railway worker quoted a passage from Chairman Mao: "...only the working class has the farthest vision, is most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail, and with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." He said, "We Japanese working class must fully recognize the responsibility bestowed by history and strive for the bright future of Japan."

    日本工人在“五一”节前夕热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席
    毛泽东思想给日本人民指出斗争方向
    中国文化大革命为各国人民革命树立了光辉榜样
    新华社东京一日电  日本许多工人在“五一”国际劳动节前夕，对中国记者发表谈话，热烈赞扬全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利。
    他们指出，今年的“五一”国际劳动节是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉普照全世界的情况下到来的。这些日本工人对毛主席怀有深厚的感情，对毛泽东思想无限热爱。他们指出，毛泽东思想给日本劳动人民指出了斗争方向，给了他们无限勇气。一位坚持学习毛主席著作的职工兴奋地说：“毛泽东思想是在全世界放射出万丈光芒的当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰；毛泽东思想是我们斗争的武器，有了毛泽东思想，就能团结人民，狠狠地打击敌人。”他激动地说：“我衷心热爱毛主席，我高呼毛主席万岁！万万岁！”一位在仪表制造厂做工的工人满腔热情地说，为了迎接“五一”，他同其他朋友们一起赶制了一幅毛主席的巨幅像，准备在“五一”游行时抬着走在队伍最前面，以表达日本劳动人民对毛主席的无比热爱。
    日本工人们还指出，今年的“五一”国际劳动节是在震撼全世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利声中到来的。他们热情地赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的伟大事业。他们指出，中国无产阶级文化大革命解决了无产阶级取得政权后怎样保证无产阶级专政不变色的问题，它防止了在中国产生修正主义和资本主义复辟，它为世界各国人民的革命树立了光辉榜样。
    他们赞扬中国通过无产阶级文化大革命，成为世界人民最可靠的革命根据地，成为世界革命的更加坚强的堡垒。一位仪器制造工人表示，热烈祝贺北京市革命委员会的成立。他说，正在斗争中的日本人民应当很好地学习中国人民的革命精神，更加努力地奋斗，坚决同现代修正主义者展开斗争。
    日本工人们在谈话中还愤怒地谴责美帝国主义最近疯狂地扩大侵越战争，并且严厉谴责苏联现代修正主义充当美国侵略越南的可耻帮凶，为美帝国主义策划的“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    一位铁路工人说，我们普通工人都知道，苏修是同美帝勾结在一起的。一位职员指出，同现代修正主义进行不调和的斗争，是对越南人民抗美救国斗争的有力援助。他们还一致谴责日共修正主义分子大搞假反美真反华的卑鄙勾当。
    他们在谈到日本工人阶级当前的斗争和对未来的展望时表示，我们必须明确谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，并且加强学习毛泽东思想，同帝修反进行斗争。一位铁路工人引用了毛主席的一段话：“……只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”他说，我们日本工人阶级应当充分认识到历史赋予自己的职责，为实现日本的光明的未来而奋斗。
