In the backyard of U.S. imperialism, Latin America, the working class and laboring people, in their struggle against the brutal oppression and exploitation by U.S. monopoly capital and the reactionary forces in their own countries, have bravely taken to the streets. Despite the reactionary governments declaring strikes "illegal" and the capitalists threatening to fire workers, they have broken through the control and deception of the upper echelons of the government or revisionist-controlled unions, and are courageously fighting back.

The struggle of the Argentine working people against U.S. imperialism and its agents is developing. Nearly 220,000 railway workers held a 24-hour strike on January 12 to protest the so-called "work regulations" drafted by the pro-American dictatorship of Onganía, which aimed to strengthen the oppression and exploitation of workers. In February, a series of strikes erupted in various major cities of Argentina. On March 1, 1.5 million workers from various industries in Argentina held a general strike. This marked a new high point in the workers' struggle in Argentina over the past half year.

Recently, workers and other laboring people in Ecuador have been continuously holding strikes and other forms of struggle to resist the exploitation and oppression by U.S. and local business owners. Agricultural workers and farmers, who are cruelly exploited by U.S. capitalists and local landlords, have also risen up to fight for their rights. Some agricultural workers and farmers have issued statements strongly denouncing the brutal exploitation and plunder by U.S. capitalists, announcing the formation of their own unions, and launching strike struggles.

In El Salvador, due to the plunder and extortion by U.S. imperialism in areas such as export trade and commodity prices, the economic crisis in El Salvador has become increasingly severe, and people's lives have become extremely impoverished. The struggle of the Salvadoran laboring people against exploitation and oppression has seen new developments.

On January 18, public bus workers in El Salvador launched the country's first-ever large-scale transportation workers' strike to protest inflation.

Workers in Colombia, Guyana, Chile, Uruguay, and Peru have also launched waves of strikes this year to resist U.S. monopoly capital and the exploiting classes in their own countries.

The working class in Latin America is increasingly directing their struggle against U.S. imperialism. Recently, during the period of the Summit of American States, which was orchestrated by the United States in Punta del Este, Uruguay, workers, students, and other laboring people in the capital of Uruguay held strikes, boycotts, and demonstrations to protest the arrival of U.S. President Johnson and the summit he orchestrated. Demonstrators publicly burned a U.S. flag.

The strike struggles of the Latin American working class, in coordination with the armed struggles of the people against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in many countries, are gradually pushing forward the revolutionary situation in Latin America.

    拉丁美洲工人在反美斗争中奋勇前进
    在美帝国主义的后院拉丁美洲，工人阶级和劳动人民为了反对美国垄断资本和本国反动派的残酷压迫和剥削，不顾反动政府宣布罢工为“非法”和资本家的“解雇”威胁，冲破政府或修正主义分子控制的工会上层的诱骗和控制，英勇地进行着斗争。
    阿根廷劳动人民反对美帝国主义及其代理人的斗争正在发展。近二十二万名铁路工人在一月十二日举行了二十四小时的罢工，抗议翁加尼亚亲美独裁政权制订的加强压迫和剥削工人的所谓“工作规章”。二月间，阿根廷各大城市发生一系列罢工运动。三月一日，阿根廷各行业一百五十万工人举行了一次总罢工。这是半年多以来阿根廷工人斗争的一个新高潮。
    厄瓜多尔工人和其他劳动人民，最近不断举行罢工和其他方式的斗争，反对美国和本国企业主的剥削与压迫。在美国佬和本国庄园主残酷压榨下的农业工人和农民，也起来为维护自己的切身权利展开了种种斗争。有的农业工人和农民发表声明，强烈控诉美国资本家对他们的残酷剥削和掠夺，宣布将组成自己的工会，并举行罢工斗争。
    在萨尔瓦多，由于美帝国主义在出口贸易和商品价格等方面对萨尔瓦多进行掠夺和讹诈，使萨尔瓦多经济危机日益严重，人民生活贫困不堪，萨尔瓦多劳动人民反剥削反压迫的斗争有了新的发展。
    萨尔瓦多公共汽车工人在一月十八日发动了本国历史上第一次交通工人大罢工，反对通货膨胀。
    哥伦比亚、圭亚那、智利、乌拉圭、秘鲁的工人，今年也都掀起了反对美国垄断资本和本国剥削阶级的罢工浪潮。
    拉丁美洲的工人阶级现在愈来愈把斗争的矛头直接指向美帝国主义。最近，美国策划的美洲国家首脑会议在乌拉圭的埃斯特角举行期间，乌拉圭首都的工人、学生和其他劳动人民，举行了罢工、罢课、示威，抗议美国总统约翰逊的到达以及他所策划的这个会议。示威者当众焚烧了一面美国星条旗。
    拉丁美洲工人阶级的罢工斗争，同许多国家里的反对美帝国主义及其走狗的人民武装斗争互相呼应，正在逐渐推动拉丁美洲革命形势的发展。
