The fire of the wilds cannot be extinguished, and the spring breeze blows it back to life.

The armed struggle led by the Communist Party of the Philippines has undergone a long and arduous journey and has recently seen new developments. The news is exhilarating!

The armed struggle of the Filipino people has a glorious tradition. During the Second World War, they fought bravely against Japanese imperialism and achieved great victories. After the war, American imperialism restored its colonial rule in the Philippines and brutally suppressed the armed forces of the Filipino people. The armed forces of the Filipino people suffered a temporary setback.

However, the Filipino people did not surrender. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Philippines, they overcame numerous difficulties and continued the struggle. The People's Liberation Army of the Philippines summed up past experiences and lessons, accumulated strength, and with the support of the masses, launched new battles against American imperialism and the reactionary forces in the Philippines.

Imperialists and reactionaries always believe that they can suppress the people's revolutionary struggle through their counter-revolutionary violence. American imperialism once boasted about its so-called anti-insurgency "achievements" in the Philippines and even wanted to apply its experience in suppressing revolutions to other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. However, as long as there is national oppression and class oppression, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Chairman Mao said, "The various forms of oppression and suppression inflicted on the revolutionary people by imperialism and reactionaries will, in the end, only promote more extensive and more violent revolutions among the people." The new developments in the armed struggle of the Filipino people are a powerful proof of this.

The revolutionary cause of the Filipino people is bound to win. Of course, under the aggression of American imperialism and the rule of the reactionary forces in the Philippines, the armed struggle of the Filipino people will still face various twists and turns. However, as long as the revolutionary people of the Philippines arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, follow the path of people's war, establish revolutionary base areas, and surround the cities from the countryside, they will, after a long and arduous struggle, certainly achieve final victory.

    野火烧不尽
    野火烧不尽，春风吹又生。
    菲律宾共产党领导下的革命武装斗争，经过了长期的艰难的历程，最近又有了新的开展。消息传来，令人振奋！
    菲律宾人民的武装斗争，是有光荣传统的。在第二次世界大战期间，他们就同日本帝国主义进行过英勇的战斗，取得了很大的胜利。战后，美帝国主义重新恢复它在菲律宾的殖民统治，对菲律宾人民武装进行了残酷的镇压。菲律宾人民武装力量一度受到了暂时的挫折。
    但是，菲律宾人民并没有屈服。他们在菲律宾共产党的领导下，克服种种的困难，把斗争坚持了下来。菲律宾的人民解放军总结了过去的经验教训，积聚了力量，在人民群众支持下，同美帝国主义和菲律宾反动派展开了新的战斗。
    帝国主义和反动派总是认为，依靠他们的反革命暴力可以把人民的革命斗争镇压下去。美帝国主义曾经得意洋洋地吹嘘它在菲律宾的所谓反叛乱的“成就”，而且还想把它镇压革命的“经验”用之于亚非拉的其他国家。但是，只要有民族压迫和阶级压迫，革命和革命战争就是不可避免的。毛主席说过，帝国主义和反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”菲律宾人民武装斗争的新发展，就是一个有力的证明。
    菲律宾人民的革命事业是一定要胜利的。当然，在美帝国主义的侵略和菲律宾反动派的统治之下，菲律宾人民的武装斗争还会经历各种曲折。但是，菲律宾革命人民只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，走人民战争的道路，建立革命的根据地，以农村包围城市，经过长期的艰苦的斗争，就一定能够取得最后的胜利。
