The publication of the Central Committee's notice is a major event in our country's political life and a major event in the international communist movement. One year ago, it sounded the bugle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world. It pointed out the correct direction for the Chinese people and all revolutionary people around the world on how to consolidate power after the proletariat seizes power and prevent capitalist restoration. This is the great contribution of our beloved leader Chairman Mao to the international communist movement.

The task of consolidating power is more arduous and greater than seizing power

The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat tells us: the issue of power is the fundamental issue of the revolution in capitalist countries where the proletariat has not yet seized power, and it remains the fundamental issue of the revolution in socialist countries where the proletariat has already seized power. The task of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat is more arduous and greater than seizing power.

The class enemies never willingly accept their demise. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will always try to restore capitalism in China." The facts completely prove the correctness of Chairman Mao's teachings. In socialist countries, class enemies use more concealed forms and more cunning methods to launch a fierce attack on the proletariat. Among them, some are representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and they are a small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These people, disguised as Marxists-Leninists, use the party and government powers they have usurped to recruit and assimilate, form cliques, and engage in conspiratorial activities to restore capitalism and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. They are the most dangerous enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev is such a dangerous enemy.

We see: in some countries, the proletariat has seized power, repelled armed intervention by foreign imperialists, and suppressed armed rebellions by domestic counter-revolutionaries. However, they have not been able to solve the problem of carrying the revolution through to the end under the dictatorship of the proletariat. As a result, a small handful of bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party have usurped power, using the method of peaceful evolution to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The notice of the Central Committee, personally drafted by our beloved great leader Chairman Mao, creatively develops Marxism-Leninism and solves the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. It not only smashes the plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, providing a reliable guarantee for our Party and country to never change color, but also points the way for the proletariat of the whole world to consolidate power after seizing power and ensure the transition from socialism to communism.

Any class, in regard to the issue of power, is actively offensive and not passively retreating

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also for maintaining their power." Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses have become the masters of power. However, the class enemies who have been overthrown, though they have lost their armed forces, do not cease to plot to seize back power, nor do they cease to yearn for the "paradise" they have lost just because they have retreated from the historical stage. On the contrary, what they think, say, and do is always to seize power from the proletariat. They have only changed their tactics and varied their tricks, putting on a layer of disguise. The revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen, supported by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, throws out the "Work Report Outline," which arbitrarily turns the political struggle in the ideological and cultural fields into "pure academic" discussions, advocating "equality before truth" and so-called "freedom to speak," etc. These are all fierce attacks on the proletariat. "Academic discussion" is a cover; the real aim is to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat; "equality for all" is a cover; the real aim is to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism and to attempt to reestablish the unequal, exploitative dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Their so-called "freedom to speak" is to allow bourgeois ideology to spread freely and let ghosts and monsters wreak havoc, using a heart-piercing tactic against the dictatorship of the proletariat. In short, no matter how they change, the essence remains the same. The bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat, no matter when or how, always targets the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, we must, as Vice Chairman Lin Biao teaches, "never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to stress politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." "The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not stop." Before the classes are eliminated, the reactionaries will always make trouble and cause disruption, attempting to usurp the Party and the government. In fact, the proletariat is not only the tree but also the wind. The class enemies blow our wind, and we must blow their wind, and blow an even stronger wind, a typhoon of eleven or twelve levels, to thoroughly smash and eliminate them.

The proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the brightest hearts and the clearest eyes. The small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road advocate the theory of "class struggle extinction," advocating "caution" and "prudence" in class struggle, and "truly surpassing and overwhelming the opponent in academic and professional standards," etc. All these are poisoned arrows and sugar-coated bullets. Let them go to hell!

All reactionaries always lift the stone to hit their own feet

"'Lifting the stone to hit one's own foot,' this is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools." The biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with their self-destructive facts, once again prove that the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction is an unshakable truth. All reactionaries in history have always unwittingly served as reverse teachers for the revolutionary people. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The reactionary classes use the power they control to suppress the people with armed force, teaching the people to take up arms and seize their power. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary dictatorship and counter-revolutionary dictatorship are opposite in nature, and the former learns from the latter." Seizing power is like this, and consolidating power is also like this. The small handful of bourgeois agents who have infiltrated the Party, especially the Chinese Khrushchev, have launched a series of attacks on the dictatorship of the proletariat over the years, making us understand: consolidating power requires not only taking up the gun but also focusing on the class struggle in the ideological and cultural fields, and digging out the "time bombs" buried in the Party and government organs. Chairman Mao warned us a year ago: "The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated into the Party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have been exposed by us, some have not been exposed, and some are being trusted by us and being cultivated as our successors, such as the Khrushchev type. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of Party committees must pay full attention to this." Now the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been exposed, making us have a deeper understanding of the profound significance of Chairman Mao's instruction. Making us more aware: Mao Zedong Thought is the magic mirror for identifying all ghosts and monsters, and the guiding light for the proletariat and working people of the whole world to carry the revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause." The enemies with guns will not violate this logic, and the enemies without guns will not violate this logic; the external class enemies will not violate this logic, and the class enemies who have infiltrated the Party and the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, such as the Chinese Khrushchev, will not violate this logic. "The ant climbing the locust tree boasts of its greatness, and the wasp shaking the tree talks about how difficult it is." They arrogantly oppose Mao Zedong Thought, but the result will inevitably be that they will be knocked down by the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought; they try to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, but the result will inevitably be the opposite of their wishes, and they will be beaten to a pulp.

The dictatorship of the proletariat "is a good thing, a protective amulet, a family heirloom. Until the day when imperialism abroad and the classes at home are thoroughly and completely eliminated, this amulet must never be discarded." I am a revolutionary soldier. To defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, I dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire. I will not only hold the gun tightly but also take up the pen, together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly criticize the bourgeoisie, and completely criticize, overthrow, and defeat the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, achieving a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    巩固无产阶级专政　保证我们的国家永不变色
    沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子　王道明
    中共中央《通知》的发表，是我们国家政治生活中的一件大事，是国际共产主义运动中的一件大事。一年以前，它吹响了震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命的号角，它给中国人民和全世界革命人民在无产阶级夺取政权以后如何巩固政权、防止资本主义复辟，指出了最正确的方向。这是我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席，对国际共产主义运动的伟大贡献。
    巩固政权的任务比夺取政权更艰巨更伟大
    无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们：政权问题，在无产阶级没有夺取政权的资本主义国家，是革命的根本问题，在无产阶级已经夺取了政权的社会主义国家，仍然是革命的根本问题。巩固无产阶级政权的任务，要比夺取政权更艰巨，更伟大。
    阶级敌人总是不甘心他们的灭亡的。毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”事实完全证明了毛主席的英明论断。在社会主义国家中，阶级敌人以更加隐蔽的形式和更加狡猾的手段，向无产阶级发动猖狂进攻。他们之中有一部分是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这些人是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象，他们披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，利用他们篡夺的党政财文大权，招降纳叛，结党营私，进行复辟资本主义、变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的阴谋活动。他们是无产阶级专政最危险的敌人。中国的赫鲁晓夫就是这样的最危险的敌人。
    我们看到：世界上有一些国家，无产阶级曾经夺取了政权，打退了外国帝国主义的武装干涉，镇压了国内反革命分子的武装叛乱，但是，他们没有能解决无产阶级专政条件下把革命进行到底的问题，结果被一小撮混入党内的资产阶级代表人物篡夺了政权，用和平演变的办法，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。
    我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央的《通知》，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下的革命问题。不仅粉碎了中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋，为我们的党和国家永不变色提供了可靠的保证，而且为全世界无产阶级夺取政权后如何巩固政权、保证社会主义向共产主义过渡指明了道路。
    任何阶级对政权问题，都是积极进攻而不是消极退让
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级和广大革命人民成了政权的主人。但是，被推翻的阶级敌人，他们人还在，心不死。他们既不因为已经丧失了武装力量而不再蓄意夺回政权，也不因为已经退出了历史舞台而不再向往失去的“天堂”。相反，他们心里想的，嘴里说的，行动上干的，无时无刻不是为了从无产阶级手中夺回政权。只不过他们已经改变了战术，变换了花样，披上了一层画皮而已。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持的彭真修正主义集团抛出的《汇报提纲》，硬是把思想文化领域里的政治斗争，说成是“纯学术”讨论，鼓吹什么“在真理面前人人平等”，鼓吹所谓“放”的自由等等，都是向无产阶级的猖狂进攻。“学术讨论”是假，向无产阶级专政进攻是真；“人人平等”是假，为资本主义复辟制造舆论，妄想重新建立人吃人的、不平等的资产阶级专政是真。他们的所谓“放”，就是让资产阶级思想自由泛滥，让牛鬼蛇神兴风作浪，对无产阶级专政实行钻心战术。总之，万变不离其宗，资产阶级向无产阶级发动的进攻，无论他们在什么时间，采取什么方式，矛头总是对准无产阶级专政。因此，我们就要象林彪副主席教导的那样：“要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”“树欲静而风不止”，在阶级消灭以前，反动派总是要捣乱、破坏，企图篡党、篡政。其实，无产阶级不仅是树，也是风。阶级敌人刮我们的风，我们更要刮他们的风，而且要刮更大的风，刮十一、十二级的台风，来彻底摧垮它们，消灭它们。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，心最亮，眼最明，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派宣扬的什么“阶级斗争熄灭”论，在阶级斗争中要“谨慎”“慎重”，“在学术和业务的水准上真正大大地超过和压倒对方”等等，统统是毒箭，是糖衣炮弹，让它见鬼去吧！
    一切反动派总是搬起石头打自己的脚
    “‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以他们自取灭亡的事实，再次证明了伟大领袖毛主席这一指示是颠扑不破的真理。历史上的一切反动派，总是不自觉地充当革命人民的反面教员。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。反革命阶级利用他们掌握的政权对人民进行武装镇压，教会了人民拿起武器夺取他们的政权。毛主席教导我们：“革命的专政和反革命的专政，性质是相反的，而前者是从后者学来的。”夺取政权是这样，巩固政权也是这样。混进党内的一小撮资产阶级代理人，特别是中国的赫鲁晓夫，多少年来向无产阶级专政发动的一系列进攻，使我们懂得了：巩固政权不仅要拿起枪杆子，而且要大抓特抓思想文化领域里的阶级斗争，要挖掉埋藏在党和政府机构里的“定时炸弹”。毛主席早在一年前就告诫我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”现在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被我们揪出来了，使我们对毛主席这一指示的深刻意义，有了更加深刻的理解。使我们更加认识到：毛泽东思想是识别一切牛鬼蛇神的照妖镜，是指引全世界无产阶级和劳动人民将革命进行到底的指路明灯。
    毛主席教导说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑”。拿枪的敌人不会违背这个逻辑，不拿枪的敌人也不会违背这个逻辑；外部的阶级敌人不会违背这个逻辑，混进党内和无产阶级专政机构内部的阶级敌人，象中国的赫鲁晓夫，也不会违背这个逻辑。“蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”他们猖狂地反对毛泽东思想，结果，必然要被用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民打翻在地；他们妄想破坏无产阶级专政，结果，也必然和他们的愿望相反，碰得头破血流。
    无产阶级专政“这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”我是一个革命战士，为了捍卫无产阶级专政，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。我不仅要握紧枪杆子，而且要拿起笔杆子，和广大革命群众一起，彻底批判资产阶级，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批臭、批垮、批倒，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
