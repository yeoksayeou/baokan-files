	Shining with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary model operas—Beijing opera *Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy*, *The Harbor*, *The Red Lantern*, *Shajiabang*, *Ambush on the White Tiger Regiment*, ballet *The White-Haired Girl*, *The Red Detachment of Women*, and the symphony *Shajiabang*—were performed simultaneously in the capital amidst the enthusiastic celebration by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people marking the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*. This is a grand review of the brilliant achievements of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line, and a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party and his backers!

	These revolutionary modern Beijing operas, revolutionary modern ballets, and revolutionary modern symphonies, born in the midst of intense class struggle, are shining gems in the treasury of proletarian literature. Their creation has set a brilliant example for the development of new proletarian literature. These unprecedented revolutionary model operas in the history of human literature, with their clear political content serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, serving proletarian politics, and serving socialism, and their strong artistic appeal, have made all the so-called art of the bourgeoisie, revisionists, and feudalists pale in comparison.

	In the struggle between the bourgeoisie's conspiracy to restore capitalism and the proletariat's struggle against restoration, the literary world has always been an important battlefield for the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. For a long time, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists such as Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Shao Yuncai, have been colluding with traitors, forming factions, and seizing leadership in the literary world, issuing orders, and usurping our power. With the support of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, they have refused to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line, stubbornly pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, and performing bad plays that sing the praises of emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, foreigners, and the dead, creating public opinion for the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party to seize the Party, the army, and the government, and restore capitalism. The revolutionary modern Beijing operas, revolutionary modern ballets, and revolutionary modern symphonies that have attracted worldwide attention, were created under the guidance of Chairman Mao's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*, this epoch-making brilliant document, and under the leadership of Jiang Qing, who personally participated and directly commanded while holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, through the efforts of revolutionary literary and art workers, and after intense class struggle. The success of the model operas is a great victory for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*! Since the day these model operas were created, they have become powerful ideological weapons for defending and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories, and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary world and their backers, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, have been exposed by the revolutionary masses. In this great revolutionary situation, the concentrated performance of the model operas is a great encouragement to the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres who are celebrating the 25th anniversary of the publication of *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*.

    毛主席无产阶级文艺路线辉煌成果的盛大检阅
    八个革命样板戏在京同时上演
    新华社二十四日讯　闪烁着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的革命样板戏——京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》、《红色娘子军》，交响音乐《沙家浜》，在亿万革命人民最热烈地庆祝毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的欢呼声中，在首都同时上演。这是毛主席无产阶级文艺路线辉煌成果的盛大检阅，这是对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和以他为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺路线的沉重打击！
    这些在严重的阶级斗争中诞生的革命现代京剧、革命现代芭蕾舞剧和革命现代交响音乐，是无产阶级文艺宝库里光芒四射的明珠。它们的诞生，为无产阶级新文艺的发展树立了光辉的典范。人类文艺史上前所未有的这些革命样板戏，以它们为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务、为社会主义服务的鲜明的政治内容和强烈的艺术感染力，使一切资产阶级、修正主义和封建主义的所谓艺术黯然失色。
    在我国资产阶级阴谋复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争中，文艺界一直是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线争夺的一个重要阵地。长期以来，周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍、田汉、邵荃麟等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，招降纳叛，结党营私，窃取文艺界的领导权，发号施令，专了我们的政。他们在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，拒不执行毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，顽固地推行反革命修正主义文艺路线，大演歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人、洋人、死人等的坏戏，为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义制造舆论。举世瞩目的革命现代京剧、革命现代芭蕾舞剧和革命现代交响音乐，就是在毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一划时代的光辉文献的照耀下，在毛主席无产阶级文艺路线的指引下，在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的江青同志的亲自参加和直接指挥下，在革命文艺工作者的努力下，经过激烈的阶级斗争，创作出来的。革命样板戏的创作成功，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大胜利！这些革命样板戏，从它们问世的第一天起，就成了捍卫和巩固无产阶级专政的强大的思想武器。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，盘踞在文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子和他们的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派已经被革命群众揪了出来。在这样大好的革命形势下，革命样板戏的集中上演，对正在欢庆《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的广大工农兵、革命师生和革命干部，是一个巨大的鼓舞。
