Title: Ideals Are Turning into Reality

Today marks the first anniversary of our great leader Chairman Mao issuing the May 7th Directive. Last year on this day, seeing our great teacher personally charting out a magnificent and grand blueprint for us to advance towards communism, we were overjoyed and felt that we had a guiding light to march towards communism. However, we also felt that this was merely our goal of struggle, not something we could achieve immediately. The state pointed out by Chairman Mao seemed quite distant from our reality. Today, rereading the great teacher's May 7th Directive, the feeling is completely different. Implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive is no longer a distant matter. We have taken bold steps and begun to transform our academies, which were previously used to cultivate bourgeois experts, into Mao Zedong Thought's great schools for nurturing successors to the proletarian revolution. One year of the Cultural Revolution has made our ideals turn into reality.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long stipulated the correct policy of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." However, in reality, many of our institutions have gone against Chairman Mao's directives. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party has led our younger generation down the path of detaching from politics, labor, and the masses of workers and peasants. Our schools, which claim to be the "cradle of red engineers," are actually the cradle of "white experts," the cradle for cultivating a privileged class for the restoration of capitalism. At that time, the more advanced the specialty, the better. Each master boasted about their own set of skills. Everyone was oblivious to worldly affairs, focusing solely on becoming experts. Their minds were filled with thoughts of "exam scores," "specialized knowledge," and future careers as experts, with a narrow, frightening, and pitiful ideological outlook. If we continued down that path, we would unknowingly be "rocked" into becoming successors to revisionism in this so-called "red cradle."

We follow the great teacher's directives and severely criticize the bourgeoisie. The more we criticize, the clearer it becomes: we must first be revolutionaries, and only then specialists in a certain field. Regardless of the specialty, what we must first learn is class struggle! It is revolution! However, to learn class struggle, merely sitting in a study or confined to the campus, without contact with society, workers, and peasants, is definitely not enough. This year of the Cultural Revolution, our greatest gain has been stepping out of the study and campus, under the personal command of our great leader Chairman Mao, participating in the nationwide class struggle. Only in the great storms of class struggle can we cultivate a new generation of true proletarians. Only then do we understand the profound meaning of our great leader's criticism of the bourgeoisie in the May 7th Directive. Over the past year, people's spiritual outlook has undergone a great leap. No one is concerned with "exam scores," "specialized knowledge," and the dream of becoming an expert. Instead, they are concerned with class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, just as our great leader has taught us, focusing on national affairs. We dare to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party. We dare to declare war on everything that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. We have completely broken free from the spiritual shackles imposed by "Cultivation."

Ideals are turning into reality. Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive calls for educational reform. Now, the era of bourgeois experts ruling our institutions of higher learning has come to an end. We are truly serving proletarian politics and truly combining education with productive labor. Thus, the school system can be greatly shortened, and we can spend more time in class struggle and production struggle, learning from the workers and peasants, tempering and transforming ourselves.

We have seized power, and our status has changed. I have been elected to the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee.

I pledge to Chairman Mao that even though my status has changed, my thoughts will not. I will always maintain the spirit of revolutionary rebellion, forever remain young in revolution, forever be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, and forever be a good servant of the working people! I will never detach from the masses and strive to become a genuine successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    理想正在变成现实
    北京市革命委员会常委北航红旗负责人  韩爱晶
    今天，是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出“五·七”指示一周年。去年今日，看到伟大的导师亲自为我们规划了走向共产主义的宏伟壮丽的蓝图，我们欢欣鼓舞，感到有了向共产主义前进的指路明灯。可是，却又觉得这只是我们的奋斗目标，而不是马上就能做到的事情，毛主席所指出的那种境界离我们的现实生活似乎还比较遥远。今天重读伟大导师的“五·七”指示，感觉和去年大不相同。实现毛主席的“五·七”指示，已经不是什么遥远的事情，我们已经迈开了雄壮的步伐，开始按照这个蓝图，把我们这些过去培养资产阶级专家权威的学院，改造成造就无产阶级革命接班人的毛泽东思想的大学校。一年的文化大革命，使我们的理想正在变成现实。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席早就规定了“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的正确方针。可是，实际上，我们许多院校却违背了毛主席的指示，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派把我们青年一代引向脱离政治、脱离劳动、脱离工农群众的邪路上。我们的学校自称为“红色工程师的摇篮”，实际上是培养“白色专家”的摇篮，是为资本主义复辟培养特权阶层的摇篮。那时候，选专业越尖端越好，各家师傅给各家徒弟吹嘘自己的一套。大家是两耳不闻天下事，一心只读专家书。心里想的只是“考试分数”、“专业知识”，以及将来当什么专家等等，思想境界是多么狭隘、可怕又可怜啊！那样下去，我们就会在这个所谓“红色摇篮”中不知不觉地“摇”成修正主义接班人了。
    我们遵循伟大导师的指示，狠狠批判资产阶级。越批判就越清楚：我们首先应当是革命者，其次才是从事某一专业的建设者。不管学什么专业，首先必须学会的是阶级斗争！是闹革命！但是，要学习阶级斗争，仅仅坐在书斋里，关在校园里，不接触社会，不接触工农，是肯定学不到的。这一年文化大革命，我们最大的收获就是走出书斋，闯出校园，在伟大统帅毛主席的亲自指挥下参加了全国全面的阶级斗争，这才懂得了只有在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，才能培养出真正的无产阶级一代新人，这才懂得我们伟大统帅在“五·七”指示中所说的批判资产阶级的深刻的含义。一年来，人们的精神面貌有了一个大飞跃，大家关心的不再是什么“考试分数”“专业知识”和专家梦想，而是阶级斗争，是无产阶级专政……，也就是象我们伟大领袖所教导的那样，关心的是国家大事。我们敢于向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派进行你死我活的斗争，我们敢于向一切不符合毛泽东思想的事物宣战，我们完全打破了《修养》加在我们头上的精神枷锁。
    理想正在变成现实。毛主席的“五·七”指示，要求我们改革教育。现在，资产阶级专家统治我们高等学校的时代已经彻底结束了，我们正在真正为无产阶级政治服务，真正和生产劳动相结合。这样，学制就可以大大缩短，我们要用更多的时间到阶级斗争、生产斗争中去，向工农群众学习，锻炼改造自己。
    我们夺了权，我们的地位发生了变化。我被选进了北京市革命委员会的常委会。
    我向毛主席保证，地位变了，思想决不变，贫农儿子的本色决不变。我一定要永远保持革命造反精神，永葆革命的青春，永远做毛主席的好战士，永远做劳动人民的好勤务员！永远不脱离群众，使自己成为名副其实的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
