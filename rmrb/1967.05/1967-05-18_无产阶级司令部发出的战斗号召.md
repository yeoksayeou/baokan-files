The "Notification" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on May 16, 1966, has been publicly released! This is a great event in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We warmly welcome the publication of the "Notification." We must seriously study it, master it, and apply it.

The "Notification" is a great document of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. It provides a concise, vivid summary and profoundly insightful analysis of the intense class struggle in our country before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a battle call issued by the proletarian headquarters. It calls on us, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat, to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a comprehensive counterattack against the rampant aggression of the bourgeoisie! It is under the guidance and inspiration of the "Notification" that the millions-strong cultural revolutionary army, surging forward, has stormed the positions occupied by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and all the ghosts and monsters. The curtain of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the personal initiation and leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, has been fully raised!

In November 1965, the Shanghai "Wenhui Daily" published an article by Comrade Yao Wenyuan titled "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office,'" which marked the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. This revolutionary article directly struck at the lair of the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee headed by Peng Zhen, causing Peng Zhen and a handful of anti-revolutionary revisionists to be in a state of panic and unable to sleep. In order to save the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers they were about to lose, under Peng Zhen's plotting and the protection of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, they dared to, behind Chairman Mao's back, concoct a so-called "Report Outline on the Current Academic Discussions by the Five-Person Group for the Cultural Revolution" in February 1966. In this extremely reactionary "Report Outline," they forbade us from exposing the key issues of the poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"; they used the pretext of "pure academic discussion" to prevent us from launching a political counterattack; they allowed the bourgeoisie to speak but did not allow the proletariat to utter a word; they advocated reactionary slogans such as "equality before truth" for the bourgeoisie, boosting the morale of the bourgeoisie and demoralizing the proletariat. If anyone did not follow their "baton," they would "lead" in criticizing you, calling you "arbitrary and domineering," and labeling you as an "academic despot." It was truly menacing and arrogant!

Peng Zhen and his gang of scoundrels, along with the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road behind them, exhausted every means to strangle the budding Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. However, under the brilliant light of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, all their conspiracies and tricks have been foiled!

The "Notification" is the "thousand-jin hammer" that thoroughly smashes the "Report Outline" concocted by Peng Zhen and his gang of scoundrels. Every word in it is like a cannonball, exposing and thoroughly criticizing the great conspiracy of Peng Zhen and his gang of scoundrels, who, behind Chairman Mao's back, used the name of the Party Central Committee to deceive the entire Party. They are left with nothing but defeat.

The "Notification" points out to us: The class struggle in the cultural and ideological sphere is extremely sharp and complex. The bourgeoisie always tries to use the cultural and ideological front to create public opinion for their counter-revolutionary restoration. These struggles are reflections of the struggle between the two classes and the two roads in the socialist period, and are reflections of the struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration in the cultural and ideological sphere. Class enemies, "such as figures like Khrushchev, who are now sleeping by our side," are always on the lookout for opportunities to turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. Therefore, we must be highly vigilant and never be complacent or negligent.

Cultural and ideological workers are the vanguard of the cultural and ideological front. Over the past seventeen years, due to the usurpation of leadership in the cultural and ideological sphere by the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by Zhou Yang, they have used sugar-coated bullets to confuse us and used "three highs" and "three excellences" as bait to poison us, causing many of us to lose class vigilance and even be captured by the class enemy. This phenomenon is intolerable. However, before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this phenomenon was quite common. When the anti-revolutionary revisionist who had long boasted of being a "historian," Wu Han, suddenly wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" for the rightist opportunist who had been dismissed from office at the Lushan Conference, what was the reaction of our cultural and ideological workers? When Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article criticizing Wu Han was published, what was the reaction of our cultural and ideological workers? Everyone can think about it. Did we pay enough attention to these matters? No! This fully shows that the reactionary political sense of the class enemy is very acute, while many of our comrades were in the dark, completely ignoring this sharp and complex class struggle, completely unaware of how the class enemy infiltrated the cultural and ideological front, stirred up trouble, cheered for the anti-Party elements, and launched a rampant attack on the Party. Therefore, the "Notification" is not only an urgent order for all Party comrades but also for us cultural and ideological workers. It awakened us and pointed out: Never forget class struggle, never ignore the class enemy using culture and ideology as a weapon to attack the Party and socialism!

Now, the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are burning even more fiercely! The ranks of the revolutionary leftists of the proletariat have grown unprecedentedly under the inspiration of the "Notification." When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the stage of launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we study this "Notification" again, feeling immensely proud and intimately connected. Let us draw strength from the "Notification" to fight more bravely, more resolutely, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号召
    金敬迈
    一九六六年五月十六日中国共产党中央委员会的《通知》公开发表了！这是无产阶级文化大革命中的一件大喜事。我们热烈欢呼《通知》的发表。我们一定要认真地学习它，掌握它，运用它。
    《通知》是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的文件，它对无产阶级文化大革命前我国十分激烈的阶级斗争，作了简明、生动的概括和异常深刻的分析。它是无产阶级司令部发出的战斗号召。它号召我们无产阶级的革命战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向资产阶级的猖狂进攻进行全面反击！正是在《通知》的引导和鼓舞下，亿万文化革命大军，浩浩荡荡地冲向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神盘踞的阵地。无产阶级文化大革命的战幕，在伟大领袖毛主席的亲自发动和领导之下，全面地拉开了！
    一九六五年十一月，上海《文汇报》发表了姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》一文，揭开了我国无产阶级文化大革命的序幕。这篇革命文章，直捣以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的老巢，使彭真等一小撮反革命修正主义分子惊惶失措，不可终日。他们为了挽救将要失去的党、政、财、文大权，在彭真的阴谋策划和党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的庇护之下，竟敢背着毛主席，在一九六六年二月炮制出了一个所谓《文化革命五人小组关于当前学术讨论的汇报提纲》。在这个反动透顶的《汇报提纲》里，他们不准我们揭露大毒草《海瑞罢官》的要害问题；他们打起“纯学术讨论”的幌子，不准我们进行政治上的反击；他们只许资产阶级放，不准无产阶级吭声；他们宣扬资产阶级的“在真理面前人人平等”等反动口号，长资产阶级威风，灭无产阶级志气。谁不跟他的“指挥棒”转，他就要“有领导”地整你的风，说你是
  “武断和以势压人”，给你扣上“学阀”的帽子。真是杀气腾腾，不可一世！
    彭真一伙坏蛋和背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了扼杀在我国方兴未艾的无产阶级文化大革命，费尽了心机。但是，在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他们的阴谋诡计统统破产了！
    《通知》就是彻底粉碎彭真一伙坏蛋炮制的《汇报提纲》的“千钧棒”。它每一个字都象一颗炮弹，对彭真一伙坏蛋背着毛主席，利用党中央名义欺骗全党的大阴谋给了无情地揭露，彻底地批判，打得他们片甲不留。
    《通知》向我们指出：文化思想界的阶级斗争是异常尖锐、异常复杂的。资产阶级总是企图利用文化思想这个阵地来为他们的反革命复辟制造舆论。这些斗争，都是社会主义时期两个阶级、两条道路斗争的反映，是资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟斗争在文化思想界的反映。阶级敌人，“例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁”，他们随时都在伺机而动，要把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。因此，我们必须高度警惕，丝毫不能麻痹大意，掉以轻心。
    文艺工作者是文化思想界的尖兵。十七年来，由于周扬一伙反革命修正主义分子篡夺了文艺界的领导权，他们用糖衣炮弹迷惑我们，用“三高”、“三名”为诱饵来毒害我们，以致使我们当中的许多人失去了阶级警惕，甚至于被阶级敌人俘虏了过去。这种现象是不能令人容忍的。但是在无产阶级文化大革命以前，这种现象却是相当普遍。当一向以“历史家”自诩的反革命修正主义分子吴晗忽然钻到京剧界来写了《海瑞罢官》，为在庐山会议上被罢了官的大右倾机会主义头目鸣冤叫屈的时候，我们的文艺工作者是一种什么样的反应？当姚文元同志批判吴晗的文章发表的时候，我们的文艺工作者又是一种什么样的反应？大家可以想一想，我们对这些事情足够重视了没有？没有！这就充分说明了，阶级敌人的反动政治嗅觉是十分灵敏的，而我们的许多同志却蒙在鼓里，完全无视这场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，完全看不到阶级敌人怎样钻进文艺这个阵地来，兴风作浪，为反党分子摇旗呐喊，向党猖狂进攻。因此，《通知》不仅是给全党同志的，也是给我们文艺工作者的一个紧急号令。它惊醒了我们，向我们指出：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忽视阶级敌人正利用文艺这个武器向党向社会主义进攻！
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命的烈火烧得更旺了！无产阶级革命左派的队伍在《通知》的鼓舞下，空前地壮大起来。当无产阶级文化大革命进入到向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻的时刻，我们重新学习这个《通知》，感到无比自豪，感到无比亲切。让我们从《通知》中吸取战斗的力量，更勇敢地战斗，更坚决地战斗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
