	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The essence of Marxism-Leninism is summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.' ... Based on this truth, we rebel, we struggle, we build socialism." The revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" consistently emphasizes the spirit of daring to rebel and struggle, fully embodying the revolutionary rebel spirit of the working people of our country.

	Yang Balao and Xier, under the heavy oppression and brutal persecution of the landlord class, did not bow their heads in submission but stood tall and fought resolutely. On New Year's Eve, in the cold and snowy night, the landlord and his henchmen came to collect debts and even tried to take Xier away. Yang Balao, unable to bear it any longer, rose up in rebellion and struck the henchman with a pole, knocking him to the ground. This strike was well-deserved! It struck down the arrogance of the landlords and their henchmen and boosted the morale of the poor and lower-middle peasants; it demonstrated the heroic spirit of our working people who would rather die standing than live kneeling; it embodied the truth that where there is oppression, there is resistance. I felt truly exhilarated when I saw this.

	The brutal class struggle educated the broad masses of working people, and the atrocities of the landlord class aroused the anger of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Yang Balao and Xier rebelled, Da Chun rebelled, countless poor and lower-middle peasants rebelled, and the broad revolutionary masses rebelled.

	It is precisely the millions and millions of revolutionary masses, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, who have fought relentlessly, overthrowing the three big mountains and establishing New China. It is also the millions and millions of proletarian revolutionaries, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, who have fully carried forward the revolutionary rebel spirit and achieved one victory after another in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The former Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee, a handful of those in power taking the capitalist road, used every means to support capitalist forces, attempting to restore capitalism, and committed heinous crimes against the Party and the people. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, I, along with a few Party comrades, wrote the first big-character poster, exposing a handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the factory Party Committee, and thus suffered retaliation. The former Municipal Party Committee sent a work team, which stubbornly carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, forbidding the exposure of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party, deliberately shifting the direction of the struggle, and intending to use the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee as a tool to carry out the reactionary line. We saw that the work team's actions did not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and the Sixteen Points, so we rose up in revolution, rebelled, rebelled against the work team, and rebelled against the bourgeois reactionary line. In the fierce class struggle, revolutionary workers united and organized the Shanghai Revolutionary Workers' Rebel General Headquarters, achieving initial victories under Chairman Mao's support.

	However, a handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party were not willing to accept their defeat. After one scheme failed, they came up with another. They spread the evil wind of economism in Shanghai, fiercely counterattacking. We proletarian revolutionaries saw through their plots. With Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, we fear neither heaven nor earth, dare to make revolution, and dare to rebel. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we raised high the banner of proletarian seizure of power, bravely shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production, stopping the counterrevolutionary economism black wind, and repelling the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line.

	Currently, the call to launch a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader within the Party has been sounded. This is a decisive battle concerning the fate and future of our country. It concerns whether our country will follow the socialist road or allow the restoration of capitalism, whether the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants will be in power or allow the capitalists and the likes of Huang Shiren to return to power, and whether Yang Balao and Xier will suffer again. We proletarian revolutionaries must raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, promote great unity among the revolutionary masses, unite the majority of revolutionary masses, launch a fierce attack on the top capitalist-roader within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    革命造反精神万岁！
    上海市工人革命造反总司令部
    上海市革命委员会革命组织代表  王秀珍
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’……根据这个道理，于是就反抗，就斗争，就干社会主义。”革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》自始至终贯穿着一条敢于反抗、敢于斗争的红线，充分表现了我国劳动人民的革命造反精神。
    杨白劳、喜儿在地主阶级的重重盘剥、残酷迫害下，并没有低头屈服，而是挺起胸膛，坚决斗争。大年除夕，风雪之夜，地主、狗腿子上门逼债，还要抢走喜儿。杨白劳忍无可忍，愤起反抗，一扁担把狗腿子打倒在地。这一扁担打得好！打掉了地主和狗腿子的威风，大长了贫下中农的志气；这一扁担表现了我国劳动人民宁肯站着死、不愿跪着活的英雄气概；这一扁担体现了哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗的真理。我看到这里，心里真痛快。
    残酷的阶级斗争教育了广大劳动人民，地主阶级的暴行激起了贫下中农的愤怒。杨白劳和喜儿起来造反了，大春起来造反了，无数的贫下中农起来造反了，广大的革命群众起来造反了。
    正是千千万万的革命群众在毛主席领导下，前赴后继，进行革命斗争，推翻了三座大山，建立了新中国。也正是千千万万的无产阶级革命派在毛主席领导下，充分发扬革命造反精神，夺取了无产阶级文化大革命一个又一个的胜利。
    旧上海市委、市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，千方百计扶植资本主义势力，妄图复辟资本主义，他们对党对人民犯下了滔天大罪。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，我同几个党员同志写了第一张大字报，揭发了厂党委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，因此遭到了打击。旧市委派来了工作队，他们顽固执行资产阶级反动路线，他们不许揪党内走资本主义道路当权派，故意转移斗争大方向，而且要把文革筹委会当作执行反动路线的御用工具。我们看到工作队这样做不符合毛泽东思想，不符合十六条，就起来革命，起来造反，造工作队的反，造资产阶级反动路线的反。在激烈的阶级搏斗中，革命工人团结在一起，组织了上海革命工人造反总司令部，在毛主席的支持下，取得了初步的胜利。
    但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派并不甘心自己的失败，一计不成，又生一计，在上海大刮经济主义妖风，疯狂地进行反扑。我们无产阶级革命派识破了他们的阴谋。我们有毛泽东思想作指导，天不怕，地不怕，敢革命，敢造反。我们根据毛主席的教导，高举无产阶级夺权斗争的旗帜，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担，煞住了反革命经济主义黑风，击退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。
    目前向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的号角吹响了。这是一场关系国家命运和前途的大决战。它关系到我们国家是走社会主义道路，还是让资本主义复辟的问题，关系到是工人阶级、贫下中农当家作主，还是让资本家、黄世仁之流重新上台，让杨白劳、喜儿重新受苦的问题。我们无产阶级革命派一定要高举起革命的批判大旗，促进革命的大联合，团结大多数革命群众，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
