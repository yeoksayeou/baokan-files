The Soviet revisionist group recently brazenly announced plans to publish the infamous reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago" by the traitorous writer Pasternak in the Soviet Union.

Pasternak is a reactionary bourgeois writer. After the October Revolution, he consistently held a bourgeois reactionary stance and harbored deep hatred for the socialist Soviet Union led by Lenin and Stalin. After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, this reactionary writer released the reactionary work "Doctor Zhivago." In this novel, Pasternak used malicious distortions of reality to viciously attack the great October Socialist Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In 1956, Pasternak sent the manuscript of this novel to the West for publication. The Western bourgeoisie, obtaining this anti-communist work, treated it as a treasure, immediately translating it into multiple languages and publishing it in large quantities in many countries. They also made it into a film of the same name by an American film company, distributing it widely. Through this, they stirred up a wave of attacks on communism and slander against the dictatorship of the proletariat. Imperialists and reactionaries in various countries, in order to praise this anti-communist novel and reward the "merits" of this traitor, decided to award the Nobel Prize for Literature, which had never been given to a Soviet writer before, to this traitor. They also awarded six Oscars to the film "Doctor Zhivago."

The broad masses of the Soviet people expressed extreme indignation over this. Under the strong pressure of the Soviet people, the Soviet revisionist group, in order to deceive the people, had to feign disapproval when Pasternak received the Nobel Prize, declaring that "Doctor Zhivago" was a bad work, and expelling Pasternak from the Soviet Writers' Union.

However, a large number of facts indicate that the Soviet revisionist group's actions were entirely false. At the same time as expelling Pasternak, the then Minister of Culture of the Soviet revisionist group publicly stated that "Pasternak is a true poet and an outstanding translator." In 1961, the Soviet revisionist group openly published a collection of poems by this traitor. After the traitor's death, the Soviet revisionist group even established a special committee to organize his "literary legacy."

For many years, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to accelerate the restoration of capitalism, has published a large number of anti-communist, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-proletarian dictatorship works. The Brezhnev-Kosygin group's decision to publish "Doctor Zhivago" in the Soviet Union clearly shows that they are in cahoots with the traitor Pasternak and the imperialists and reactionaries in various countries. They are all enemies of the Soviet people and enemies of the people of the world.

### 苏修集团大刮复辟资本主义的黑风  公然要出版叛徒作家反共小说

    苏修集团大刮复辟资本主义的黑风
    公然要出版叛徒作家反共小说
    新华社九日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联修正主义集团最近公然要在苏联出版叛徒作家帕斯捷尔纳克臭名远扬的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》。
    帕斯捷尔纳克是一个反动的资产阶级作家。他在十月革命以后，一直坚持资产阶级反动立场，对列宁、斯大林领导下的社会主义苏联，怀着刻骨仇恨。苏共二十大以后，这个反动作家抛出了反动作品《日瓦戈医生》。在这本小说中，帕斯捷尔纳克用恶意歪曲现实的手法，猖狂地攻击了伟大的十月社会主义革命和无产阶级专政。
    一九五六年，帕斯捷尔纳克把这本小说的手稿寄往西方出版。西方资产阶级得到这部反共作品，如获至宝，立即把它翻译成多种文字，在许多国家大量出版，并由美国的电影公司拍成同名电影，大量发行。他们借此掀起了一阵攻击共产主义、诽谤无产阶级专政的黑风。帝国主义和各国反动派为了吹捧这部反共小说和酬谢这个叛徒的“功绩”，决定把过去从不发给苏联作家的诺贝尔文学奖金，赏给这个叛徒，并给影片《日瓦戈医生》发了六枚金像奖。
    苏联广大人民对此表示了极强烈的愤慨。在苏联人民的强大压力下，苏修集团为了欺骗人民，在帕斯捷尔纳克获得诺贝尔奖金时，不得不装模作样地宣称《日瓦戈医生》是坏作品，并把帕斯捷尔纳克开除出苏联作家协会。
    然而，大量事实表明，苏修集团这一套完全是假的。就在开除帕斯捷尔纳克同时，苏修当时的文化部长还公开说什么“帕斯捷尔纳克是一个真正的诗人和一个杰出的翻译家。”一九六一年，苏修集团公开出版了这个叛徒的诗集。在这个叛徒死后，苏修集团还专门成立了一个委员会，来整理他的“文学遗产”。
    苏修领导集团多年来为了加速复辟资本主义，出版了大量反共、反人民、反革命、反无产阶级专政的作品。勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团现在决定在苏联出版《日瓦戈医生》清楚地表明，他们同叛徒帕斯捷尔纳克以及帝国主义、各国反动派是一丘之貉，他们通通都是苏联人民的死敌，世界人民的死敌。
