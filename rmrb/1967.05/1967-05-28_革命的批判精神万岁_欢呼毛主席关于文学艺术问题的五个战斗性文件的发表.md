Our great leader Chairman Mao's five combat-ready documents on literary and artistic issues: "After Watching 'Forced Up the Mountain,' a Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe," "The Discussion on the Film 'Wu Xun' Should Be Given Serious Attention," "A Letter on the Question of Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" and "Two Instructions on Literature and Art," have now been publicly issued. The thorough revolutionary critical spirit and the dialectical materialist thought of breaking down and establishing anew, like a radiant red thread, run through these important documents.

The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is critical, combative, and revolutionary. It is in the broadest scope and the greatest depth that it criticizes and struggles against the old world, old system, old ideas, and old culture, and in the process of breaking down and establishing anew that it is built and developed. It advances every step through struggle.

When Lenin talked about Marx's thorough scientific critical attitude, he said: "He examined everything created by human society with a critical attitude, not missing a single point. He re-examined and criticized everything built by human thought, and checked it one by one based on the practice of the workers' movement, thus drawing conclusions that those limited by bourgeois narrowness or bound by bourgeois prejudices could not draw." ("The Tasks of the Youth League" "Lenin Collected Works" Volume 31, pages 253-254)

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are built and continuously developed in the struggle to break down the bourgeois ideological system. Chairman Mao said: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without removal, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." "Destruction is criticism, is revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. With destruction as the main focus, construction is also within it." The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, which is the greatest destruction and the greatest construction.

In 1944, in "After Watching 'Forced Up the Mountain,' a Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe," Chairman Mao raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing the reactionary phenomena on the old stage and in all old literature and art that deny the workers, peasants, and soldiers and distort history. He sharply pointed out: This historical distortion must now be reversed. Our great teacher Chairman Mao, before seizing national power, while focusing on armed struggle, highly valued the class struggle in the ideological realm and the struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies. This was to prepare public opinion for the Chinese proletariat to overthrow the rule of the landlord and bourgeoisie and achieve national victory.

After national liberation, Chairman Mao's "The Discussion on the Film 'Wu Xun' Should Be Given Serious Attention," "A Letter on the Question of Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" and "Two Instructions on Literature and Art" took as their guiding principle the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. They thoroughly criticized the traitorous "Secrets of the Forbidden City," the slavish "Wu Xun," the idealistic "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" the emperors, generals, and scholars on the stage, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the realm of thought and culture. All of this, ultimately, was to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Why have Chairman Mao's series of important instructions on ideological and literary issues since national liberation not been implemented? Now it is clear that this is because the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, together with a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who usurped the leadership of the cultural sphere—Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo-han, Qi Yanming, and Xia Yan—openly resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's instructions and usurped our power. If we do not launch a great proletarian cultural revolution with the participation of hundreds of millions of people, we will not be able to cleanse the muddy water left by the old world, overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist rule on the ideological and cultural front, and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship.

Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the most fundamental issue of breaking down and establishing anew is to thoroughly criticize those who, under the banner of "red," oppose the red flag and infiltrate the leadership organs of the party and the government—a handful of capitalist-roaders. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, revolutionary masses have exposed the "Khrushchev-like figures" who "sleep by our side," that is, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and are conducting thorough criticism and struggle against them. This is the most fundamental criticism, the most central criticism. The proletarian revolutionary forces across the country must grasp this fundamental and central issue, break down and establish anew, and seize back the positions usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

In his series of great works and instructions, and in the "May 16 Notification" personally drafted by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1966, the correct solution to the problem of relying on whom and using what methods to carry out this breaking down and establishing anew has been provided. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the broadest masses to carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution—this is the best form of breaking down and establishing anew in all political, economic, and cultural realms of the whole society under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship.

Using the method of mass movement to carry out the struggle of breaking down and establishing anew, it is necessary to mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals from the bottom up, believing that the masses can liberate themselves and educate themselves, believing that the masses can thoroughly criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line represented by them, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, and thoroughly criticize revisionist ideology. If we do not believe in the masses, do not rely on the masses, do not mobilize the masses, and do not advocate great democracy under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, we will not be able to achieve thorough criticism and thus genuine construction; we will not be able to break down and establish anew.

The unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution has been going on for a year. Now, the proletarian revolutionary forces are uniting to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and are conducting thorough criticism and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader within the party. This is a more comprehensive and profound struggle of breaking down and establishing anew. All revolutionary comrades should seriously study Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and principles of the great proletarian cultural revolution, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, direct the targets of thorough criticism and struggle at the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and combine it well with the struggle, criticism, and reform in your own region, department, and unit, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

### 革命的批判精神万岁——欢呼毛主席关于文学艺术问题的五个战斗性文件的发表

    革命的批判精神万岁
    ——欢呼毛主席关于文学艺术问题的五个战斗性文件的发表
    我们伟大领袖毛主席关于文学艺术问题的五个战斗性文件：《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》、《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》、《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》和《关于文学艺术的两个批示》，现在公开发表了。这些重要文件的彻底革命的批判精神，大破大立的辩证唯物主义的思想，象一根光彩夺目的红线，贯彻始终。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质是批判的，战斗的，革命的。它是在最广阔的规模上和最大的深度上对旧世界、旧制度、旧思想、旧文化进行批判和斗争中，在大破大立中建立和发展起来的。它每前进一步，都要经过战斗。
    列宁在谈到马克思彻底的科学的批判态度时说：“凡是人类社会所创造的一切，他都用批判的态度加以审查，任何一点也没有忽略过去。凡是人类思想所建树的一切，他都重新探讨过，批判过，根据工人运动的实践一一检验过，于是就得出了那些被资产阶级狭隘性所限制或被资产阶级偏见束缚住的人所不能得出的结论。”（《共青团的任务》《列宁全集》三十一卷二百五十三至二百五十四页）
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就是在破资产阶级思想体系的斗争中建立和不断发展起来的。毛主席说：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。“破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的精髓，就是无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，这就是最大的破，最大的立。
    毛主席在一九四四年《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》中，高举革命的批判大旗，大破旧戏舞台上和一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上那种否定工农兵、颠倒历史的反动现象，尖锐地指出：这种历史的颠倒，现在要再颠倒过来。我们伟大的导师毛主席，在夺取全国政权之前，在狠抓武装斗争的同时，高度重视意识形态领域的阶级斗争，高度重视无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的斗争。这是为我国无产阶级推翻地主资产阶级政权，夺取全国胜利作舆论的准备。
    毛主席在全国解放以后写的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》、《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》和《关于文学艺术的两个批示》，以无产阶级专政条件下两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，大破卖国主义的《清宫秘史》，大破奴隶主义的《武训传》，大破唯心主义的《红楼梦研究》，大破戏剧舞台上的帝王将相、才子佳人，大破思想、文化领域里的反革命修正主义黑线。这一切，归根到底，都是为了巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。
    全国解放以来，毛主席关于思想、文艺问题的一系列重要指示为什么贯彻不了呢？现在看得很清楚，这是因为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，伙同窃取了文化界领导权的一小撮反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍等人，公然抵制和对抗毛主席的指示，专了我们的政。如果我们不发动一场有亿万群众参加的无产阶级文化大革命，就不可能荡涤旧世界遗留下来的污泥浊水，就不可能摧毁思想文化阵地上的反革命修正主义统治，就不可能巩固无产阶级专政。
    在无产阶级专政条件下的大破大立，最根本的问题，就是要大破那些打着“红旗”反红旗，混到党和政权领导机关内部的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，革命群众揭露出了“睡在我们的身旁”的“赫鲁晓夫那样的人物”，即党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对他们进行大批判，大斗争。这是最根本的破，最中心的破。全国无产阶级革命派必须抓住这个根本，这个中心，大破大立，把被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派盘踞的阵地夺回来。
    毛泽东同志在他一系列伟大著作和指示中，在他亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》中，正确地解决了依靠谁和用什么方法来进行这个大破大立的问题。相信群众、依靠群众，放手发动最广大的群众来进行无产阶级文化大革命，这就是在无产阶级专政条件下，在整个社会的政治、经济和文化的各个领域里，进行大破大立的最好的形式。
    用群众运动的方法，进行大破大立的斗争，这就要自下而上地把广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子充分地发动起来，相信群众能够自己解放自己，自己教育自己，相信群众能够大破党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，大破以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线，大破资产阶级思想，大破修正主义思想。如果不相信群众，不依靠群众，不放手发动群众，不发扬无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，就不可能彻底的破，也就不可能真正的立；就不可能大破大立。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命已经进行一年了。现在，无产阶级革命派正在联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派开展大批判、大斗争。这是一场更全面、更深刻的大破大立。一切革命同志，都应当认真学习毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把大批判、大斗争的目标，对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并且，同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗、批、改很好地结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
