People of Asian and African countries hold demonstrations and parades

	According to a comprehensive report from Xinhua News Agency, in recent days, people from various Asian and African countries have held parades, demonstrations, and rallies to oppose U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel's aggression and war threats against Arab countries, and to support the struggle of the Arab people.

	Thousands of Iraqi youth held a parade and demonstration in Baghdad on the afternoon of the 29th. The demonstrators carried large banners with slogans such as: "People's liberation war is the road to liberation!" "The united struggle of the Arab masses will smash aggression and recover the occupied homeland!" "Arab youth are determined to smash imperialism and Zionism!" The demonstrators chanted slogans along the way: "Down with the U.S.!" "Down with Zionism!" After the parade, the demonstrators held a rally at Liberation Square, angrily denouncing U.S. imperialism's instigation and support for Israel's aggression.

	About three thousand workers, employees, and students in Yemen held a grand demonstration and rally in Sana'a on the 28th. The demonstrators chanted slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Down with British imperialism," "Down with Israel." They carried banners with slogans: "Support the Syrian people's just struggle against the aggression of Israel and U.S. imperialism." They marched to the Syrian Embassy in Yemen, where they held a rally in support of the Syrian people's struggle against Israel. Many people spoke at the rally, condemning imperialist aggression, and emphasized that the Arab people should unite to defeat all forms of colonialism and imperialist aggression.

	About ten thousand people held a demonstration in the capital of Sudan on the 25th. Demonstrators carrying large banners chanted slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Zionism!" "Voluntarily take up arms to strike the enemy!" When the demonstration passed by the U.S. Embassy, the chant "Down with U.S. imperialism!" echoed through the sky. The demonstrators sent representatives to meet with the Syrian and Egyptian ambassadors to Sudan, expressing full support for the people of their countries in their struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression.

	The people of Pakistan held a large-scale demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Karachi on the 29th. The demonstration, composed of workers, students, and other sectors of the people, carried portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao. The demonstrators chanted: "Down with U.S. imperialism," "Yankees, get out of Asia!" The Yankees hid in the U.S. Embassy building, afraid to show their faces. Before the demonstration reached the U.S. Embassy, the Yankees cowardly took down the ugly American flag in front of the building. The angry demonstrators threw stones at the U.S. Embassy building to express their strong indignation against U.S. imperialism, the root of all aggression and evil in the world. Angry students continuously chanted "Down with U.S. imperialism" and tore down an American flag along the way, throwing it to the ground.

    伊拉克青年数千人二十九日下午在巴格达举行游行示威。示威者高举巨大横幅标语，上面写着：“人民解放战争是通向解放的道路！”“阿拉伯群众的联合斗争必将粉碎侵略和收复被强占的家园！”“阿拉伯青年决心粉碎帝国主义和犹太复国主义！”示威者一路高呼口号：“打倒美国！”“打倒犹太复国主义！”游行之后，示威者在解放广场举行集会，愤怒谴责美帝国主义唆使和支持以色列进行侵略。
    约三千名也门工人、职员和学生二十八日在萨那举行声势浩大的示威游行和群众集会。示威群众高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义”，“打倒英帝国主义”，“打倒以色列”。他们拿着横幅标语，上面写着：“支持叙利亚人民反对以色列和美帝国主义侵略的正义斗争”。他们列队前往叙利亚驻也门大使馆，在大使馆院内，举行了支持叙利亚人民反对以色列斗争的群众集会。会上许多人发表讲话，谴责帝国主义的侵略，并强调指出，阿拉伯人民应当团结起来，击败殖民主义和帝国主义的各种侵略活动。
