Over the past few days, American aggressor aircraft, after being struck three times by our air force, still refused to give up. On May 2, they once again intruded into the airspace of Ningming County, Guangxi, and brazenly dropped bombs, destroying our civilian homes and farmland, and threatening the safety of our residents. This is another heinous crime committed by American imperialism against the Chinese people!

Our people firmly support the Ministry of National Defense spokesperson's protest and warning to American imperialism, and are determined to join our brave People's Liberation Army soldiers in retaliating against American imperialism's military provocations with even greater punishment!

Recently, our air force has achieved three victories in three battles, shooting down five American planes in just eight days, giving the American aggressors a severe beating and making them lose face. They neither dare to admit it nor are willing to stop, instead resorting to desperate measures, sneaking in to drop bombs, attempting to intimidate the great Chinese people. This is nothing but a pipe dream! To be honest, your bombs can only scare those who talk about how "a single spark can start a prairie fire." For the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, even your atomic bombs are not a concern, let alone a few bombs. If you come to mourn your fallen comrades, you will meet the same fate and will not end well.

The American aggressors are escalating the war in Vietnam and, with the cooperation of the Soviet revisionists, are trying to force surrender through bombing. With the great socialist China as the backbone of the Vietnamese people, the conspiracies of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism will never succeed! We warn American imperialism: No matter what tactics you use or what tricks you play, you will never shake the resolute will of the Chinese people to support Vietnam and resist America!

The Chinese people are not to be provoked. The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, with their revolutionary fighting spirit heightened a hundredfold during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have the strength, determination, and confidence to defeat all domestic and foreign enemies. If American imperialism and its accomplices dare to provoke the great seven hundred million Chinese people, they had better be careful of their own heads!

    中国人民不是好惹的
    本报评论员
    连日以来，美国入侵强盗飞机，在遭到我空军部队三次狠狠打击之后，又贼心不死，于五月二日再次侵入我广西宁明县上空，悍然投弹轰炸，毁损我民房耕地，威胁我居民安全。这是美帝国主义对中国人民犯下的又一次滔天罪行！
    我国人民坚决支持我国防部发言人对美帝国主义发出的抗议和警告，并且决心同英勇的人民解放军指战员一起，用加倍的惩罚来回答美帝国主义的军事挑衅！
    最近，我空军部队三战三捷，在短短八天内，把美国飞机揍掉了五架，打痛了美国强盗，使它大丢其脸。它既不敢承认，又不肯罢休，狗急跳墙，偷偷摸摸地窜进来丢炸弹，妄想吓唬伟大的中国人民。这岂不是白日做梦？老实讲，你们的炸弹只能吓唬那些胡说什么“一颗火星就会引起世界大战”的软骨头。对于用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民和人民解放军，连你们的原子弹都从来不放在眼里，难道你们几颗炸弹还在话下吗？你们来为被揍下来的伙计吊孝，也只能遭到同样的命运，决不会有好下场。
    美国侵略者正在越南加紧战争“升级”，同时在苏修配合下，大搞“以炸迫降”。有伟大的社会主义的中国作越南人民的后盾，美帝苏修的阴谋永远不会得逞！我们警告美帝国主义：不管你们施出什么样的手段，玩弄什么样的花招，都休想动摇中国人民援越抗美的坚强决心！
    中国人民不是好惹的。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中百倍增强了革命战斗精神的中国人民和人民解放军，有力量，有决心，有信心战胜一切国内外敌人。如果美帝国主义及其帮凶，胆敢在伟大的七亿中国人民头上动土，那就要切切实实小心你们的脑袋！
