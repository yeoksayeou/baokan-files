South Vietnamese Liberation Army Strikes U.S. Missile Launch Site

Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: Saigon News: On the morning of the 14th, the armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation forces attacked a U.S. missile launch site near the city of Da Nang.

According to reports, this launch site, equipped with Hawk surface-to-air missiles, is located on a hill less than five kilometers west of Da Nang and is heavily guarded by U.S. Marine Corps. However, the brave and clever soldiers of the liberation armed forces penetrated the barbed wire obstacles and launched a fierce attack on this launch site using explosive packages and hand grenades.

On the day before, the liberation armed forces used mortars to attack the U.S. military base at Chu Lai near Da Nang. It is reported that two landing craft were damaged and many U.S. soldiers were injured.

In recent days, the liberation armed forces have continuously attacked U.S. bases from the area south of the demilitarized zone to the Saigon area. On the early morning of the 13th, the liberation armed forces continued to shell the U.S. Marine Corps base at Kun Thien, south of the demilitarized zone, with mortars. This base has been under continuous shelling since the night of May 7th and the early morning of the 8th.

In the Saigon area, the liberation armed forces shelled the U.S. military base at Phu Lam, north of Saigon, for the third consecutive morning on the 13th. On the 12th, while fiercely attacking the U.S. military base at Bien Hoa, northeast of Saigon, the liberation armed forces also shelled the Phu Lam airfield.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi: The "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" of Vietnam published editorials on the 11th, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victories recently achieved by the heroic military and people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces in South Vietnam in the area south of the demilitarized zone.

The editorial of the "People's Daily" pointed out that these new victories more prominently expose the miserable defeat and dire straits of the U.S. aggressors in South Vietnam, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. bandits' plot to establish the "ninth route defense line" and create a "no-man's-land" south of the demilitarized zone.

The editorial pointed out that the liberation armed forces have made rapid progress in command level and combat technology. The soldiers of the liberation army have shown extraordinary bravery in battle, courageously charging into enemy positions, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat, and annihilating large numbers of enemies.

The editorial of the "People's Army Daily" pointed out that these are a series of great victories in annihilating a large number of U.S. puppet troops, seizing a large number of weapons, and capturing many enemies. The battle for Hill 881 in the Xa Xuyen area, the battle to capture the Wei village stronghold, and the coordinated attacks on Kun Thien, Yu Temple, Dong Ha, and Hill 241 are vivid expressions of the liberation armed forces' active annihilation warfare. This proves that the liberation armed forces have grown rapidly, their ability to annihilate the enemy is increasing day by day, the situation in South Vietnam is excellent, and the liberation armed forces firmly grasp the initiative on the battlefield.

The editorial calls on the military and people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien to advance and achieve even more glorious victories, making greater contributions to the thorough smashing of the U.S. aggressors' second "dry season counteroffensive plan."

    南越解放军猛袭美军导弹发射场
    新华社十四日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十四日清晨袭击了岘港附近美国侵略军的导弹发射场。
    据报道，这个装备着隼式地对空导弹的发射场位于岘港以西不到五公里的高地上，由美国海军陆战队重兵防守。但是，英勇机智的解放武装力量的战士们穿过了铁丝网障碍，用炸药包和手榴弹对这个发射场进行了猛烈的袭击。
    在这一天以前，解放武装力量用迫击炮袭击了岘港附近美军朱莱基地。据透露，击伤登陆艇两艘，打伤美军多名。
    这几天来，解放武装力量从非军事区以南地区到西贡地区，不断袭击美国侵略军的基地。解放武装力量十三日凌晨继续用迫击炮轰击非军事区以南美国海军陆战队昆天基地。这个基地自五月七日深夜和八日凌晨以来，一直不断地受到炮击。
    西贡地区的解放武装力量十三日清晨连续第三次炮击了西贡以北的美军福永机场。十二日，解放武装力量在猛烈袭击西贡东北美军边和空军基地的同时，对福永机场进行了炮击。
    新华社河内电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》十一日分别发表社论，热烈欢呼英雄的越南南方广治、承天两省军民最近在非军事区以南地区接连取得的辉煌胜利。
    《人民报》的社论指出，这些新胜利更加突出地使美国侵略者在南越遭到的惨败和深陷泥潭的窘境暴露出来，给了美国强盗企图建立第九号公路防线和在非军事区以南建立
  “无人区”的阴谋以沉重的打击。
    社论指出，解放武装力量在指挥水平和作战技术等方面都有了飞快的进步。解放军战士们在战斗中表现得无比英勇，他们勇猛地冲入敌军阵地，大打白刃战，大量歼灭敌人。
    《人民军队报》的社论指出，这是消灭美伪军的大量有生力量，缴获大批武器，俘虏许多敌人的一系列的战斗的巨大胜利。溪星地区881高地的战斗，攻克卫村据点的战斗，攻进昆天、育庙、东河和241高地的密切配合的袭击战，是解放武装力量积极打歼灭战思想的生动表现。这证明，解放武装力量有了迅速的成长，他们打歼灭战的能力日益增强，南越战场形势无限好，解放武装力量牢牢地掌握着战场上的主动权。
    社论号召广治、承天军民乘胜前进，夺取更加辉煌的胜利，为彻底粉碎美国侵略强盗的第二个“旱季战略反攻计划”作出更大贡献。
