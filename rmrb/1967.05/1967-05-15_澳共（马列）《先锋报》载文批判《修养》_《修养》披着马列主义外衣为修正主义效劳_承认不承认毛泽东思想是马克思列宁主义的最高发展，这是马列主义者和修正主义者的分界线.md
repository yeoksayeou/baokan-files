	Moscow, May 14 (New China News Agency) -- Melbourne: The official newspaper of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), "Vanguard," published an article criticizing the book "Self-Cultivation" written by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Chinese Communist Party. The article points out that although "Self-Cultivation" is cloaked in Marxism-Leninism, it is actually serving revisionism and serving Khrushchev.

	The article, published in the May 4 issue of "Vanguard," states: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is increasingly resonating with the hearts of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. It is also increasingly resonating with the hearts of the oppressed peoples of the world.

	The article says: In China, "Self-Cultivation" is currently being thoroughly criticized. For many years, we Australians have been influenced by this book and even quoted passages from it. This book is very harmful. "Because it is cloaked in Marxism-Leninism, and its author is considered a Marxist-Leninist, it is even more harmful."

	The article continues: "If we accept the statements of this or that 'authority' without thinking or testing them in practice and struggle, we are sure to be deceived. On the other hand, if we accept Mao Zedong's thought of daring to think, daring to act, daring to struggle, and daring to win, then we can truly transform ourselves in the revolutionary cause for the people."

	The article points out: "Individualism, that is, pursuing personal success, is a characteristic of capitalism. It subordinates public interests to personal interests. Everyone seeks personal success. This is the reflection of capitalist exploitation in people's minds. This book on self-cultivation clearly reflects this. It actually approaches the problem from a personal perspective: how to maintain individualism while being a 'good Communist.' Of course, this is an attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable. For Communists, the correct starting point can only be the revolutionary interests of the workers and the laboring people. In the revolutionary struggle, serving the people is the sole criterion for a good Communist."

	The article points out: "Self-Cultivation" was reprinted in 1962 at a critical moment in the struggle against Khrushchev revisionism. "At that time, reprinting this book was to strike at the Communists who were engaged in the anti-revisionist struggle."

	The article emphasizes: "Whether or not one acknowledges that Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of Marxism-Leninism is the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists. However, this book does not acknowledge that Mao Zedong Thought is the development of Marxism-Leninism. Indeed, (the book) verbally praises Mao Zedong and even quotes his words. But revisionists also quote the words of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. The real issue is whether the revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism has been carried forward. In 1962, when this book was reprinted, the banner of Marxism-Leninism and its anti-revisionist revolutionary spirit was held high by Mao Zedong. 'This book was reprinted in such a situation in 1962.' 'It is serving revisionism and serving Khrushchev.'"

	The article says: "Revisionism does not appear with a warning sign. It appears in many disguises. It appears in the disguise of Marxism-Leninism. It uses the language of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, it is of paramount importance that we be highly vigilant and purge revisionism from the depths of our minds."

	The article then discusses how to identify and purge revisionism. The article says: "There is only one way. This way is to strictly follow Mao Zedong Thought, and Mao Zedong Thought, in all its meanings, is the highest development of Marxism-Leninism in our era. 'Marxism-Leninism must have a specific content that is in line with the present era. This is Mao Zedong Thought. This requires learning, that is, the kind of learning that Mao Zedong talks about in all his works, especially in 'On Practice,' 'On Contradiction,' 'Rectify the Party's Style of Work,' 'Reform Our Study,' and 'Study and the Current Situation.'"

	The article concludes: "The following words of Mao Zedong have profound and combative wisdom: 'Communist Party members must ask why about everything, must think it over carefully in their own minds, consider whether it is in line with reality, whether it is reasonable, and absolutely must not be blindly obedient, and absolutely must not advocate slavishness.'"

    澳共（马列）《先锋报》载文批判《修养》
    《修养》披着马列主义外衣为修正主义效劳
    承认不承认毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的最高发展，这是马列主义者和修正主义者的分界线
    新华社十四日讯　墨尔本消息：澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》在一篇批判中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所著的《修养》一书的文章中指出，《修养》虽然披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，而实际上“是为修正主义效劳的，为赫鲁晓夫效劳的”。
    这篇发表在五月四日一期《先锋报》上的文章指出：中国的无产阶级文化大革命越来越深入中国人民和中国共产党人的心。它也越来越深入全世界被压迫人民的心。
    文章说：在中国，《修养》一书目前正在被彻底的批判。多年来，我们澳大利亚人受了这本书的影响，甚至引述这本书上的话。这本书非常有害。“由于披着马克思列宁主义外衣，并且它的作者被认为是一个马克思列宁主义者，它就更加有害了。”
    文章接着说：“如果我们不加思考、不在实践和斗争中加以考验就接受这个或那个‘权威’的言论，我们肯定要上当。另一方面，如果我们接受毛泽东的敢想、敢干、敢于斗争、敢于胜利的思想，那么，我们就能够在为人民而进行的革命事业中真正改造我们自己。”
    文章指出：“个人主义，即坚持个人的飞黄腾达，是资本主义的特点。它把公共利益从属于个人。……人人都要谋求个人的成功。这就是资本主义的剥削在人们思想上的反映。这本论修养的书十分清楚地反映了这一点。它实际上是从个人的观点对待这个问题的：怎样保持个人主义，同时又做一个‘好共产党员’。当然，这是要去调和本来无法调和的东西。对共产党人来说，正确的出发点只能是工人和劳动人民的革命利益。在革命斗争中为人民服务，是一个好的共产党员的唯一标准。”
    文章指出：《修养》是选择在一九六二年反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义斗争的紧要时刻再版的。“在那个时候再版这本书是要打击正在进行反修斗争的共产党人。”
    文章强调指出：“一个人是否承认毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的最高发展，这是马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者的分界线。但是在这本书里，根本没有认为毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义的发展。诚然，（这本书）在口头上奉承了毛泽东，甚至引用了他的话。但是，修正主义者也引述马克思、恩格斯和列宁的话。真正的问题在于，是否发扬了马克思列宁主义的革命灵魂。在一九六二年这本书再版的时候，马克思列宁主义的旗手和它的反修革命灵魂是毛泽东。”“这本书就是在一九六二年的这种情况下再版的。”“它是为修正主义效劳的，为赫鲁晓夫效劳的。”
    文章说：“修正主义并不带着一个引人警惕的招牌出现。它是披着许多伪装出现的。它是在马克思列宁主义的伪装下出现的。它使用马克思列宁主义的词句。因此，具有头等重要意义的是，我们要非常警惕，并且从我们的思想的最深处肃清修正主义。”
    文章接着谈到如何识别和肃清修正主义的问题。文章说：“只有一个途径可循。这个途径就是严格遵循毛泽东思想，而毛泽东思想从它的一切含义来看，是我们的时代的马克思列宁主义的最高发展。”“马克思列宁主义必须有一个合乎当前时代的具体内容。这就是毛泽东思想。这需要学习，也就是毛泽东在他的全部著作中，特别是在《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《整顿党的作风》、《改造我们的学习》、《学习和时局》中所说的那种学习。”
    文章最后说：“毛泽东的下述一段话具有深刻的、富有战斗性的智慧：‘共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。’”
