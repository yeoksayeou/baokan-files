	Mao Zedong Thought is a great milestone in the history of Marxism's development

	The "Notice" is a rallying call for the Japanese people to fight against imperialism and revisionism

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: On May 24, Japanese renowned revolutionary Anzai Koji, Chairman of the Japan Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee Sakamoto Tokumatsu, and Secretary-General of the Japan Federation of Publishers and Booksellers Iioka Kunihiko spoke to a reporter from the East Is Red News Agency. They unanimously emphasized that the "Notice" issued by the CPC Central Committee on May 16, 1966, is a great historical document for the revolutionary people of the whole world. It once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism.

	Anzai Koji pointed out that when the great Lenin built socialism in the Soviet Union, revisionists usurped power and restored capitalism, the contemporary Lenin—great Mao Zedong—brilliantly and excellently solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism.

	Anzai said that in the past, when the Chinese revolution was in extreme difficulty, Chairman Mao brilliantly foresaw the prospect of the Chinese revolution and led it to victory. He said that now, when imperialism and modern revisionism are rampantly opposing the revolution and opposing China, Chairman Mao, in the world revolution's base—Beijing—sees the overall situation of the world revolution and points out its prospect.

	Anzai particularly pointed out the importance of the section in the "Notice" that says, "Those who have infiltrated into the party, government, army, and various cultural circles as representatives of the bourgeoisie are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." He stressed that the "Notice" directly points out lessons for us Japanese Marxists-Leninists.

	Sakamoto Tokumatsu said, "This great historical document is a guiding light for the Japanese people and the people of Asia and Africa in their struggle. We must seriously study it and apply it in practice."

	Sakamoto said, Mao Zedong Thought inherits and develops the scientific socialist theory and proletarian revolutionary theory of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. It is the greatest milestone in the history of Marxism's development.

	Sakamoto stressed, "Now, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionists, who take an anti-China, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary stance, impose the wrong line on the Japanese people. We must seriously study the 'Notice' issued by the CPC Central Committee. In the fields of politics, ideology, academia, and international solidarity movements, we must use great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to bravely fight against the bourgeois and revisionist lines and thoroughly defeat them."

	Iioka Kunihiko said, "When I heard the broadcast of the CPC Central Committee's 'Notice' on the Beijing radio, I could not suppress my inner excitement, and I felt an endless surge of courage from within. This document is a rallying call for us, a powerful weapon to smash imperialism and modern revisionism."

	Iioka said, "This 'Notice' is a great milestone pointing the direction of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, and at the same time, it is a great beacon pointing the direction of the contemporary world proletarian revolution."

	Iioka said, "This document proves that Mao Zedong Thought has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Only by acknowledging Mao Zedong Thought can one be a true Marxist-Leninist."

	He said, "The 'Notice' gives the Japanese people endless courage. Chairman Mao is not only the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people but also the red sun in our hearts, the Japanese people. Mao Zedong Thought is the invincible Marxism-Leninism. As long as the Japanese people firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought and fight on, they can smash imperialism, (modern) revisionism, and reactionaries, and achieve the final victory."

    日本著名革命家安斋库治等欢呼中共中央《通知》是伟大的历史性文献
    毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展史上伟大里程碑
    《通知》是鼓舞日本人民反帝反修的进军号
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本著名的革命家安斋库治、日本亚非人民团结委员会理事长坂本德松和日本出版工会协议会书记长饭冈邦辅，二十四日向东方通讯社记者发表谈话时一致强调指出，中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》是全世界革命人民的一个伟大的历史性文献。它再一次证明毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。
    安斋库治指出，在伟大的列宁缔造的社会主义的苏联，发生了修正主义分子篡夺政权，复辟资本主义的时候，当代的列宁——伟大的毛泽东同志天才地出色地解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。
    安斋说，过去，毛主席在中国革命处于极端困难的时候，就天才地预见到中国革命的前景，并把它引向胜利。他说，现在，正当帝国主义和现代修正主义猖狂地反对革命、反对中国的时候，毛主席在世界革命的根据地——北京，洞察世界革命的全局，并指出了它的前景。
    安斋特别指出，《通知》中说的“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”这一段话的重要性。他强调说，《通知》对我们日本的马列主义者说来，是直接向我们指出了教训。
    坂本德松说，《通知》“这个伟大的历史性文件是日本人民和亚非人民进行斗争的指路明灯。我们必须认真地进行学习，并且要活学活用”。
    坂本说，毛泽东思想继承和发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的科学的社会主义理论和无产阶级革命的理论，是马克思主义的发展史上最伟大的里程碑。
    坂本强调说：“现在，采取反华、反人民、反革命的立场的日共修正主义分子，把错误的路线强加给日本人民。我们必须认真学习中共中央发表的这个《通知》，无论在政治、思想、学术的领域里或在国际团结运动的领域里，都以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，勇敢地同资产阶级的、修正主义的路线进行斗争，彻底地打垮它们”。
    饭冈邦辅说：“我听到北京电台广播中共中央《通知》的时候，难于抑制内心的激情，并且感到从内心涌出无限的勇气。这个文件对我们来说，是一个进军的号角，是打倒美帝国主义、粉碎现代修正主义的强大的武器”。
    饭冈说：“这个《通知》是指出中国无产阶级文化大革命方向的伟大的里程碑，同时也是指出当代世界无产阶级革命方向的伟大灯塔”。
    饭冈说：“这个文件证明，毛泽东思想把马克思列宁主义发展到了新的阶段，只有承认毛泽东思想才是真正的马克思列宁主义者”。
    他说：“《通知》给日本人民以无限的勇气。毛主席不仅是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是我们日本人民心中的红太阳。毛泽东思想是战无不胜的马克思列宁主义。日本人民只要紧紧掌握毛泽东思想战斗下去，就能够粉碎帝国主义、（现代）修正主义和反动派，取得最后的胜利。”
