The editorial department of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* published an extremely important political document titled "The Crux of *Cultivation* is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." This document provides new and powerful ideological weapons for the nationwide revolutionary masses who are currently criticizing the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Leaders of several revolutionary mass organizations in the capital have expressed their determination to grasp the crux of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his *Cultivation*, to thoroughly criticize and expose them, and to push the revolutionary criticism movement to a new high tide.

Liu Xichang, chairman of the core group of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Congress, and Wang Jingrui, vice-chairman of the core group, said: Chairman Mao teaches us that the dictatorship of the proletariat "is as indispensable to the victorious people as clothing, food, and daily necessities. It is a good thing, a protective talisman, and a family heirloom that must never be discarded until imperialism abroad and classes at home are completely and thoroughly eliminated." The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, however, openly opposes Chairman Mao, refusing to discuss real class struggles and the dictatorship of the proletariat in his masterpiece *Cultivation*. This is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and it is a thorough revisionism.

Our proletarian dictatorship and our socialist mountains and rivers were won by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party leading us workers and the people of the entire country through long, arduous armed struggles and bloodshed. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party dares to attempt to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship, restore capitalism, and push us workers and laboring people back into the position of being oppressed and exploited. We will never allow this! We will never allow this!

"All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death against the revolutionary forces precisely to maintain their power." We workers must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, pass down the talisman of the dictatorship of the proletariat from generation to generation, ensure that our socialist iron mountains and rivers remain unshakable for eternity, and ensure that the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought shines forever!

Deng Wantian, chairman of the core group of the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress and director of the Zhai Li Brigade of Songzhuang Commune in Tong County, exposed and criticized the crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, which was supported by him, in crazily sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said: The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party attempts to use *Cultivation* to lull the revolutionary people into forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that he can implement bourgeois dictatorship and restore capitalism. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never let his conspiracy succeed.

After liberation, the class struggle history of Zhai Li Village deeply educated us, making us understand that revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. He said, over the past seventeen years, Zhai Li Village has experienced a series of sharp and complex class struggles, each of which revolved around the issue of power. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class enemies took advantage of the counter-revolutionary reversal of the bourgeois reactionary line nationwide to regroup their counter-revolutionary forces, spreading white terror in the village and attempting to seize power from the poor and lower-middle peasants again. However, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and with the strong support of the proletarian revolutionary masses, we finally smashed the enemy's crazy counterattack and defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. In the face of the dictatorship of the proletariat, there can be no wavering or ambiguity. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party attempts to use *Cultivation* to peddle his black goods of betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat, but we will not allow it. We poor and lower-middle peasants must fight him to the end, firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp power, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, ensuring that our socialist mountains and rivers remain unshakable forever.

Nie Yuanzi, chairman of the core group of the Red Guards Congress of the capital's colleges and universities and director of the Cultural Revolution Committee of Peking University, said: At this critical moment when the criticism movement against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his *Cultivation* is reaching a new high tide, the publication of the important article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" has brought powerful weapons of Mao Zedong Thought to the broad revolutionary masses and pointed out the direction for the criticism movement.

*The Cultivation* book does not mention the proletariat seizing power or the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the more than thirty years of democratic revolution and socialist revolution, this biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has been the total representative of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. He fiercely opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Mao Zedong Thought, opposes the proletariat seizing power, and opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat. He attempts to lead China down the road of party destruction and national ruin, to implement the restoration of capitalism in China. In a word, he wants to establish bourgeois dictatorship in China. This is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

From 1939 to 1962, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party published his *Cultivation* time and time again, with the purpose of politically and ideologically disintegrating our revolutionary ranks, disintegrating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and implementing capitalism and the restoration of capitalism. The article by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* thoroughly exposes the reactionary essence of *Cultivation*, which has great significance for cleansing its poison in China and around the world.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has ultimately been for the purpose of consolidating and developing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, we have nothing. We proletarian revolutionaries must seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hoist the banner of revolutionary criticism, concentrate our targets, grasp the crux, and thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his *Cultivation*!

Qiao Dafu, vice-chairman of the core group of the Red Guards Congress of the capital's colleges and universities and leader of the Jingan Mountain Corps of Tsinghua University, said: The article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" is a heavy artillery shell aimed at the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. It profoundly expounds that the fundamental difference between true Marxists-Leninists and all opportunists and revisionists who wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism lies in whether they acknowledge and implement the dictatorship of the proletariat. It completely exposes the opportunist and revisionist face of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat, to the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of the world. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's masterpiece *Cultivation* does not mention real class struggles or the dictatorship of the proletariat, instead advocating that "cultivation is everything." It wants us to "cultivate in seclusion," "cultivate ourselves," attempting to make us forget about power, to "cultivate" into docile tools that do not engage in socialist revolution and walk the path of "peaceful evolution," to "cultivate" into figures like Khrushchev who do not want the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. His purpose is to let this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists implement the restoration of capitalism in China. How sinister his intentions are!

"Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party betrays the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to lead us down the wrong path of "cultivating in seclusion" to achieve his goal of restoring capitalism. We proletarian revolutionaries must do the opposite. We must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionaries must unite, further combine with the struggle-criticism-transformation of their own units, thoroughly criticize the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his *Cultivation*, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Tan Hulan, vice-chairman of the core group of the Red Guards Congress of the capital's colleges and universities and leader of the Jingan Mountain Commune of the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Normal University, said: The article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" is a signal gun for the revolutionary criticism and struggle mass movement to develop in depth. The article hits the crux of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, hitting it accurately and forcefully!

The author of *Cultivation* advocates that people detach themselves from real class struggles, and we must actively engage in real class struggles. Currently, a serious task before us is to even higher hoist the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the criticism and struggle mass movement through to the end, to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We must combine the criticism movement with the struggle-criticism-transformation of our own units.

"When the enemy is routed, we should pursue them relentlessly." Let us raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, pursue and attack fiercely, and resolutely overthrow the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and defend the great dictatorship of the proletariat to the death!

Han Aijing, vice-chairman of the core group of the Red Guards Congress of the capital's colleges and universities and leader of the Red Flag Combat Team of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, said: The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought, whether to support or oppose, love or hate, is the dividing line and touchstone between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. The author of *Cultivation* fiercely opposes Mao Zedong Thought, opposes the proletariat seizing power, opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and attempts to implement capitalism and restore capitalism. We must grasp this crux issue of *Cultivation*, thoroughly criticize it, and cleanse its poison throughout the country and the world.

We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power." Without power, the laboring people have nothing. We are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to defend the power we have already seized and to further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and all oppressed peoples in the world who want to overthrow the rule of imperialism, colonialism, and domestic reactionaries must arm themselves and seize power. In countries ruled by revisionist leadership cliques, the people must ultimately seize power to gain liberation. The proletariat can only transition to communism after seizing power worldwide and implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Li Dongmin, leader of the Red Guards Congress of Beijing's middle schools, said: We read the article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and felt truly relieved! It hit the crux of *Cultivation* in one go. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat in the book *Cultivation*. Does this mean he does not want dictatorship? Absolutely not! This bad guy understands the function of dictatorship very well. He wants to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with bourgeois dictatorship. In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the author of *Cultivation* used his concocted bourgeois reactionary line to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, still dreaming of restoring capitalism and achieving his bourgeois dictatorship. We must thoroughly criticize him. We deeply understand that without the dictatorship of the proletariat, the revolutionary people have nothing. We middle school proletarian revolutionaries must hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrate our firepower, fiercely criticize *Cultivation*, resolutely overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗掀起大批判运动的新高潮
    狠狠抓住要害　彻底批臭《修养》
    首都革命群众组织的负责人揭露和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政的罪行
    新华社十三日讯　《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部发表的《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这一极为重要的政治文献，为正在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展革命大批判的全国广大革命群众，提供了新的强大的思想武器。首都一些革命群众组织的负责人纷纷向本社记者发表谈话，决心要狠狠抓住党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其《修养》的要害，充分地、全面地、深入地痛加批判，把革命的大批判运动推向新的高潮。
    北京市革命职工代表会议核心组组长刘锡昌、核心组副组长王景瑞说：毛主席教导我们，无产阶级专政“对于胜利了的人民，这是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。这是一个很好的东西，是一个护身的法宝，是一个传家的法宝，直到国外的帝国主义和国内的阶级被彻底地干净地消灭之日，这个法宝是万万不可以弃置不用的。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却公然和毛主席大唱反调，在他的代表作《修养》中闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，闭口不提无产阶级专政，这是对于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻头彻尾的背叛，这是彻头彻尾的修正主义。
    我们的无产阶级专政的政权，我们的社会主义江山，是毛主席和中国共产党领导我们工人阶级和全国人民，经过长期的艰巨的武装斗争和流血牺牲取得的。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图推翻我们的无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义，把我们工人阶级和劳动人民重新推上做牛做马的受压迫、受剥削的地位，我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！
    “世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”我们工人阶级一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，把无产阶级专政这个法宝一代一代地传下去，保证我们社会主义的铁打江山千秋万代永不变色，保证光焰无际的毛泽东思想世世代代永放光芒！
    北京市贫下中农代表会议核心组组长、通县宋庄公社翟里大队大队长邓万田，以他亲身经历揭露和批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其支持下的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团疯狂破坏无产阶级专政的罪行。他说：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄想通过《修养》来麻痹革命人民，要我们忘记无产阶级专政，以便他实行资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。我们贫下中农绝不让他这一阴谋得逞。
    解放后翟里村的阶级斗争史深深地教育了我们，使我们懂得了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民一定要念念不忘无产阶级专政。他说，十七年来，翟里村经历了一系列尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，每一次斗争都是围绕着一个“权”字进行的。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，阶级敌人又趁着资产阶级反动路线在全国大反扑的时候，重新纠集反革命队伍，在村里大搞白色恐怖，妄图再从贫下中农手中把大权夺走。但是，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，在无产阶级革命派的大力支持下，我们终于粉碎了敌人的疯狂反扑，保卫了无产阶级专政，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。在无产阶级专政这个问题面前，绝不能有丝毫的动摇和含糊。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图通过《修养》推销他背叛无产阶级专政的黑货，我们绝不答应。我们贫下中农一定要同他斗争到底，坚决遵照毛主席的教导，牢牢掌握大权，念念不忘无产阶级专政，保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
    首都大专院校红代会核心组组长、北京大学文化革命委员会主任聂元梓说：在当前对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其《修养》的大批判运动进入新高潮的关键时刻，《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇重要文章的发表，给广大革命群众送来了毛泽东思想的强大的武器，为大批判运动指明了方向。
    《修养》一书绝口不谈无产阶级夺取政权，不谈无产阶级专政。在民主革命和社会主义革命的三十多年中，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是资产阶级和修正主义的总代表，他猖狂反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对无产阶级夺取政权，反对无产阶级专政，妄图把中国引向亡党亡国的道路，在中国实行资本主义的复辟。一句话，他就是要在中国建立资产阶级专政。这是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻底的背叛。
    从一九三九年到一九六二年，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派一次又一次出版他的《修养》，其目的就是要从政治上、思想上瓦解我们的革命队伍，瓦解无产阶级专政，实行资本主义和复辟资本主义。《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部的文章，彻底戳穿了《修养》的反动本质，这对于在我国和世界范围内肃清《修养》的流毒，都有着巨大的意义。
    一年来的无产阶级文化大革命，归根到底就是为了巩固和发展无产阶级专政。没有无产阶级专政，就没有我们的一切。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要认真地活学活用毛主席著作，高举革命的批判大旗，集中目标，抓住要害，把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其《修养》批倒，批臭，批深，批透！
    首都大专院校红代会核心组副组长、清华大学井冈山兵团负责人蒯大富说：《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇文章，是射向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一颗重型炮弹。它深刻地阐述了真正的马列主义者同一切披着马列主义外衣的机会主义者、修正主义者的根本区别，就在于承认不承认、实行不实行无产阶级专政。它把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政的机会主义、修正主义面目，彻底地暴露在全中国人民和全世界革命人民的面前。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的代表作《修养》，闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政，宣扬什么“修养就是一切”。它要我们去“闭门修养”，“自身修养”，妄图使我们忘记政权，一个个“修”成不搞社会主义革命，走上“和平演变”道路的“驯服工具”，“修”成不要无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的赫鲁晓夫式的人物。他这样做的目的，就是要让他们这一小撮反革命修正主义分子在中国实行资本主义复辟，真是用心何其毒也！
    “凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，企图把我们引向“闭门修养”的邪路，以达到其复辟资本主义的目的，我们无产阶级革命派就一定要反其道而行之。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。无产阶级革命派联合起来，进一步结合本单位的斗批改，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其《修养》展开彻底的大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    首都大专院校红代会核心组副组长、北京师范大学革命委员会、井冈山公社负责人谭厚兰说：《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇文章，是使革命的大批判、大斗争的群众运动向纵深发展的号炮。文章击中了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的要害，打得准，打得狠！
    《修养》的作者鼓吹人们脱离现实阶级斗争，我们就是要最积极地投身到现实阶级斗争中去。目前，摆在我们面前的一个严重任务，就是要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，把这个大批判、大斗争的群众运动进行到底，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上批深，批透，批倒，批臭。把大批判运动和本单位的斗批改结合起来。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇”，让我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，穷追猛打，坚决打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓死保卫伟大的无产阶级专政！
    首都大专院校红代会核心组副组长、北京航空学院红旗战斗队负责人韩爱晶说：对毛泽东思想采取什么态度，是拥护还是反对，是热爱还是仇恨，这是真革命和假革命，革命和反革命，马列主义和修正主义的分水岭和试金石。《修养》一书的作者疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，反对无产阶级夺取政权，反对无产阶级专政，妄图实行资本主义、复辟资本主义。我们必须抓住《修养》这个要害问题，彻底加以批判，在全国、全世界，彻底肃清它的流毒。
    我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”没有政权，就没有劳动人民的一切。我们进行无产阶级文化大革命，就是为了保卫已经取得的政权，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。亚非拉人民和世界上一切被压迫人民要推翻帝国主义、殖民主义和国内反动派的统治，一定要武装起来，夺取政权。修正主义领导集团统治的国家，人民要获得解放，最终也是要夺取政权。无产阶级只有在全世界夺取政权，实行无产阶级专政，才能最终过渡到共产主义。
    北京市中学红代会负责人李冬民说：我们读了《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇文章，心里觉得真痛快！它一下子就打中了《修养》的要害。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》这本书中闭口不谈无产阶级专政，是他不要专政了吗？绝对不是！这个坏家伙很懂得专政的作用，他是要用资产阶级专政来代替无产阶级专政。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，《修养》的作者又用他所炮制的资产阶级反动路线，来对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，还做着复辟资本主义、实现他的资产阶级专政的幻梦。我们必须对他进行彻底的批判。我们深深地懂得，离开了无产阶级专政，就没有革命人民的一切。我们中学无产阶级革命派一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，集中火力，狠批《修养》，坚决打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
