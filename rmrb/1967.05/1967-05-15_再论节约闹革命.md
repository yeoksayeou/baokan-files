	On Frugality and Revolution Again

	“To promote revolution through frugality.” This is the great call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao.

	Every revolutionary comrade must unconditionally and consciously carry out Chairman Mao’s great call, grasp the revolution, vigorously promote production, resolutely protect the property of the state and the collective, and eliminate all unnecessary expenditures.

	Chairman Mao said: “Embezzlement and waste are grave crimes.” “Savings of every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause, for our economic construction, is the principle of our accounting system.” We must always remember Chairman Mao’s teachings.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction, after seizing power, has carried forward the fine tradition of promoting revolution through frugality, with a sense of responsibility as the master of the country, saving every grain of rice, every inch of cloth, every sheet of paper, every unit of electricity, and every cent of money for the state. Many newly established revolutionary committees have thoroughly reformed the old institutions, vigorously implemented streamlining, and presented a revolutionary new situation. They resolutely carry out the policy of “grasp the revolution, promote production.” Industrial and agricultural production is showing a very good situation. However, there are also some people who do not pay much attention to frugality, using their power to issue vouchers at will, spending lavishly, buying this and that. Some do not pay attention to saving paper, saving flour, saving broadcasting equipment. Some use transportation vehicles indiscriminately, wasting gasoline, wasting production and transportation vehicles. Some even show off, compete for luxury, and decorate their own small hills. These phenomena must be corrected immediately.

	It must be seen that our country is still not rich. As Chairman Mao teaches us, “Our country is a socialist great power, but it is also an economically backward poor country. This is a great contradiction. To make our country prosperous and strong, it will take several decades of hard struggle, including the implementation of the policy of thrift and opposition to waste in building the country.”

	Frugality is the characteristic of the proletariat, while extravagance and waste are the characteristics of the bourgeoisie. True proletarian revolutionaries have always been frugal in promoting revolution.

	“To promote revolution through frugality,” the key lies in the revolutionization of people’s thoughts, especially the thoughts of the leading members. In addition, some necessary systems and measures need to be established, such as establishing a normal revolutionary order, adhering to the eight-hour workday, implementing streamlining, reducing non-production personnel, cadres participating in collective production labor, and financial expenditure supervision by the masses, etc.

	Promoting revolution through frugality is not just about saving a few cents, but about whether to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end or to stop halfway; whether to be a thorough revolutionary or a corrupt and degenerate element; whether our proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated and whether the country will change color.

	Forgetting hard struggle is the beginning of “peaceful evolution.” Among the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, some have come through the long years of revolutionary war, but after entering the city, they gradually discarded the fine tradition of hard struggle of our party, became officials and lords, detached from the masses, lived in luxury, and were hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. This is a serious lesson. The proletarian revolutionary faction has grown up under the nurture of Mao Zedong Thought and has come through the great waves of class struggle. However, among our young comrades, many have not suffered the hardships of the old society and have not experienced the hard years of revolutionary war. Some also lack labor tempering and have not yet deepened their feelings with the working people. Therefore, after the proletarian revolutionary faction seizes power, it is especially necessary to carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of the party, resolutely resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and always maintain the firmness of the proletarian revolution, so that our power will always remain red.

### 再论节约闹革命

    再论节约闹革命
    “要节约闹革命”。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的伟大号召。
    每一个革命同志，都应当不折不扣地、自觉地执行毛主席的这个伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，坚决保护国家和集体的财产，杜绝一切不必要的开支。
    毛主席说：“贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪。”“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设，是我们的会计制度的原则。”我们要时刻记住毛主席的这一教导。
    无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，发扬节约闹革命的优良作风，以主人翁的政治责任感，为国家节约一粒米、一寸布、一张纸、一度电、一分钱。许多新成立的革命委员会，他们彻底改革旧的机构，大力实行精简，出现了革命化的新气象。他们坚决执行“抓革命，促生产”的方针，工业农业生产正呈现一派大好形势。但是，也有一些人，不大注意节约，利用手里的权随便开条子，大手大脚，买这买那。有的不注意节约纸张，不注意节约面粉，不注意节约广播器材。有的随便使用交通工具，浪费汽油，浪费生产运输车辆。有的甚至讲排场，比阔气，装饰自己的小山头。这些现象，都是必须迅速改正的。
    必须看到，我们的国家还不富裕。正如毛主席教导我们的那样，“我国是一个社会主义的大国，但又是一个经济落后的穷国，这是一个很大的矛盾。要使我国富强起来，需要几十年艰苦奋斗的时间，其中包括执行厉行节约、反对浪费这样一个勤俭建国的方针。”
    勤俭节约是无产阶级的本色，铺张浪费是资产阶级的特性。真正的无产阶级革命派，从来都是节约闹革命的。
    “要节约闹革命”，关键在于人的思想革命化，尤其是领导成员的思想革命化。另外，还需要建立一些必要的制度和措施，例如，建立正常的革命秩序，坚持八小时工作制，实行精简，减少脱产人员，干部参加集体生产劳动，以及财政开支上的群众性的监督等等。
    节约闹革命，决不仅仅是节省几个钱的小事，而是关系到把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，还是半途而废的大问题；是做一个彻底的革命者，还是做一个腐化堕落分子的大问题；是关系到我们的无产阶级专政能不能巩固，国家变不变颜色的大问题。
    忘了艰苦奋斗，就是“和平演变”的开始。在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派中间，有一些人是从长期革命战争的艰苦岁月里走过来的；但是，他们进入城市以后，逐渐抛掉了我们党的艰苦奋斗的优良作风，做官当老爷，脱离群众，养尊处优，被资产阶级糖衣炮弹打中了。这是一个严重的教训。无产阶级革命派是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的，是从阶级斗争的大风浪中闯出来的。但是，在我们的青年同志中，不少人没有吃过旧社会的苦头，没有经历过革命战争那种艰苦岁月的磨炼。还有些人缺乏劳动锻炼，同劳动人民的感情还不深。因此，无产阶级革命派掌权以后，特别需要发扬党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统，坚决抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，永远保持无产阶级革命的坚定性，使我们的政权永远保持鲜红的颜色。
