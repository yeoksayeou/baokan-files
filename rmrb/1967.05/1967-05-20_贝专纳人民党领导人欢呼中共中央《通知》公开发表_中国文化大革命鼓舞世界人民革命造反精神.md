The leader of the Botswana People's Party, Bobbi Mark, expressed enthusiastic congratulations on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and on the tremendous victories achieved in this revolution of world historical significance over the past year.

Bobbi Mark told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent about the publication of the CCP Central Committee's May 16, 1966 Notice: "The victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China over the past year shows that, by adhering to the revolutionary line of the great leader Chairman Mao as expounded in this historic document, the Notice, the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries and the Chinese people have defeated the capitalist-roaders in authority within the Party, headed by Liu Shaoqi, and the Peng Zhen revisionist clique's revisionist line. They have achieved great victories in exposing this small handful of revisionists and seizing power from them. The great victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year are also manifested in the nationwide mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, the invincible banner of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, in the emergence of the great Red Guards movement, and in the astonishing achievements in industry, agriculture, literature and art, and science. In the latter respect, this is shown in the three successful nuclear explosions. We wholeheartedly share the happiness of the Chinese people and regard their great victories as our own great victories."

Bobbi Mark pointed out: This small handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists attempted to suppress the proletarian leftists with their bourgeois reactionary line and to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, we are glad to see that Chairman Mao and the CCP Central Committee have maintained great vigilance, and the Chinese people educated by Chairman Mao are very vigilant. This reactionary line has been exposed and defeated.

Bobbi Mark said: "Based on my personal observations during my two visits to China at the height of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and my close attention to this movement, I feel that this revolution has great international significance. It guarantees that there will be no revisionism in the world revolutionary bastion—great socialist China—and prevents the restoration of capitalism. This has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of the world and their spirit of rebellion against U.S.-led imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism and for liberation. This is why it has provoked the vicious slander of the people's enemies, but has won the warm support and praise of the revolutionary people of the world."

In denouncing the top capitalist-roader within the CCP and his book "How to Be a Good Communist," Bobbi Mark said, "The editorials of the Red Flag magazine and the People's Daily on May 8 (The Essence of 'How to Be a Good Communist' Is to Betray Proletarian Dictatorship) have hit the nail on the head of this Khrushchev of China. He has betrayed proletarian dictatorship, which means he has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He is a very dangerous person; one can imagine that if his revisionist line had prevailed, not only would China change color like the Soviet Union, but the world anti-imperialist struggle would also suffer a setback. ... It is precisely Chairman Mao and his revolutionary line, Chairman Mao's full trust in and firm reliance on the broad masses, that have spared China from such a disaster and retrogression. This has also made a great contribution to the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world against U.S.-led imperialism."

    贝专纳人民党领导人欢呼中共中央《通知》公开发表
    中国文化大革命鼓舞世界人民革命造反精神
    新华社开罗十八日电  贝专纳人民党全国执行委员波比·马克十八日在这里表示热烈祝贺伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，和这一具有世界历史意义的文化大革命在过去一年中所取得的巨大胜利。
    波比·马克就中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的公开发表对新华社记者说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命在过去的一年里胜利的发展表明，由于遵循在这个历史性文件《通知》中所阐述的伟大领袖毛主席的革命路线，中国无产阶级革命派和中国人民已经击败了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和彭真修正主义集团的修正主义路线。他们在揭露这一小撮修正主义分子和从他们手里夺权方面已经取得了伟大的胜利。中国人民过去一年在无产阶级文化大革命中所取得的伟大胜利，还表现在全国范围的活学活用战无不胜的毛泽东思想（当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义）的群众运动，表现在伟大的红卫兵运动的出现，和工业、农业、文艺、科学领域的惊人的成就。关于后者，表现在三次成功的核爆炸。我们衷心地分享中国人民的幸福，认为他们的伟大胜利就是我们自己的伟大胜利。”
    波比·马克指出：这一小撮反革命修正主义分子以他们的资产阶级反动路线来镇压无产阶级左派，企图扼杀无产阶级文化大革命。然而，我们感到高兴的是：毛主席和中国共产党中央保持着极大的警惕性，毛主席教导出来的中国人民是十分警惕的。这条反动路线被揭露了，而且被击败了。
    波比·马克说：“根据我在中国无产阶级文化大革命高潮时两次访问中国的亲身观察以及我对这个运动的密切注视，我感到这次革命具有伟大的国际意义，它保证了在世界革命的堡垒——伟大的社会主义中国不出修正主义，防止资本主义复辟。这大大鼓舞了世界革命人民，鼓舞了他们反对以美国为首的帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义和争取解放的造反精神。这就是为什么它引起了人民的敌人的恶毒污蔑，却得到世界革命人民的衷心支持和赞扬。”
    波比·马克在谴责中国共产党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及其《修养》一书时说，“《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部八日的文章（《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》）打中了这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的要害。他背叛了无产阶级专政，就是背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。他是一个非常危险的人物；可以设想，假如他的修正主义路线得逞，不仅中国会象苏联那样改变颜色，而且世界反帝斗争也会受到挫折，……。正是毛主席及其革命路线、毛主席对广大群众的充分信任和坚决依靠，才使得中国免受这样的灾难和倒退。这也对世界革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争作出了巨大的贡献。”
