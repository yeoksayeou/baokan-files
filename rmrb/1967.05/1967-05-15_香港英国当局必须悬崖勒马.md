In recent days, the British authorities in Hong Kong have mobilized a large number of military and police forces to carry out bloody suppression and mad persecution against Chinese workers, representatives from various circles, and young students in Hong Kong. Over 400 of our patriotic compatriots have been arrested and beaten, with one person severely injured and dying.

The Chinese government and people are extremely indignant at and strongly protest against the fascist atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong!

The bloody incident created by the British authorities in Hong Kong is a premeditated, organized, and planned act of violence, a mad provocation by the British government against the Chinese people.

In recent times, the British government has ignored repeated warnings from the Chinese government and used British military facilities in Hong Kong to intensify support for the U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam. It has also taken various hostile measures against China in Hong Kong, following the U.S. imperialists in their frenzied anti-China activities. The British government dares to make an enemy of the 700 million Chinese people and act as a henchman for U.S. imperialism in its anti-China activities. This will only result in their lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet.

The British authorities in Hong Kong have been trying every means to block and weaken the powerful influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to suppress the rapidly growing patriotic sentiments of the Hong Kong compatriots, and to suppress the recent wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Now, the British authorities in Hong Kong have actually resorted to bloody suppression, committing heinous crimes against our Hong Kong compatriots. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

Chairman Mao said, "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The bloody suppression by the British authorities in Hong Kong only exposes their weakness and cannot frighten the Hong Kong patriots who are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the face of the military and police suppression by the British, they fear no violence, holding high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and loudly reciting, "We are determined to fight, not to be afraid of sacrifice, to overcome all difficulties, and to strive for victory." They have shown the great fearlessness of the Chinese people. They are the good sons and daughters of the motherland educated by Mao Zedong Thought.

Now, after committing this series of atrocities, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only show no sign of repentance but are trying to further escalate the situation.

We solemnly warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be bullied. Blood debts must be repaid with blood. The Chinese government and people firmly support the heroic and just struggle of the Hong Kong compatriots and will be their strong backing. We will not allow you to wantonly persecute the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong who are right next to us. You must immediately accept all the legitimate demands of the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong, immediately stop all fascist measures, immediately release all detained persons, punish the perpetrators of this bloody atrocity, apologize to the victims, compensate for all losses, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

The statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already solemnly pointed out: "The Chinese government and people are determined to fight this battle to the end." If the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong do not stop their reckless course and continue their wrongdoings, they will not have a good end.

    香港英国当局必须悬崖勒马
    本报评论员
    连日来，香港英国当局出动大批军警暴徒，对香港的中国工人、各界代表和青年学生进行了血腥的镇压和疯狂的迫害。我爱国同胞四百多人遭到逮捕毒打，一人重伤身死。
    我国政府和我国人民对于香港英国当局的这种法西斯暴行，表示无比的愤慨，提出最强烈的抗议！
    香港英国当局制造的这一血腥事件，完全是它蓄谋已久的、有组织、有计划的暴行，是英国政府对中国人民的疯狂挑衅。
    最近一个时期以来，英国政府无视我国政府的一再警告，利用香港的英国军事设施，加紧为美帝侵越战争效劳。它还在香港采取敌视我国的种种措施，追随美帝国主义猖狂地进行反华活动。英国政府胆敢与七亿中国人民为敌，充当美帝国主义反华打手，这只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    香港英国当局千方百计地企图封锁和削弱我国无产阶级文化大革命的强大影响，压制香港同胞迅速增长起来的爱国情绪，压制最近掀起的活学活用毛主席著作的热潮。现在，香港英国当局竟然使用血腥镇压的暴力手段，对我香港同胞犯下了滔天的罪行。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    毛主席说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎”。香港英国当局的血腥镇压，只能表明它的虚弱，绝对吓不倒用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港爱国同胞。他们在英国军警的武力镇压面前，不畏强暴，高举《毛主席语录》，高呼“毛主席万岁！”高声朗诵
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们表现了中国人民的大无畏气概。他们是毛泽东思想教导出来的祖国好儿女。
    现在，香港英国当局在制造了这一连串暴行之后，不但没有认错悔改之意，而且还企图进一步扩大事态。
    我们严正警告香港英国当局：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决不是好欺侮的。血债要用血来还。我国政府和我国人民坚决支持香港同胞的英勇正义的斗争，坚决做他们的强大后盾。我们决不能允许你们恣意迫害近在咫尺的香港爱国同胞。你们必须立即接受香港中国工人和居民的全部正当要求，立即停止一切法西斯措施，立即释放全体被捕人员，惩办这一血腥暴行的凶手，向受害者道歉，赔偿一切损失，并保证不再发生类此事件。
    我外交部发表的声明中已经严正指出：“中国政府和中国人民决心把这场斗争进行到底。”如果英国政府和香港英国当局不悬崖勒马，继续倒行逆施，是决不会有好下场的。
