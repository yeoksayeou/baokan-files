The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist invasion of the demilitarized zone.

The military and people of South Vietnam are determined to punish all U.S. imperialist steps to escalate the war.

The Vietnam Fatherland Front calls on the people to press forward and strike hard at the U.S. aggressors.

	Hanoi, May 23 (New China News Agency) According to a report from the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on May 22 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists for dispatching large numbers of U.S.-puppet troops to invade the southern part of the demilitarized zone. The statement solemnly declares: The people and armed forces of South Vietnam have the full right to take appropriate measures to punish all the U.S. aggressors' steps to escalate the war, and to drive out the U.S.-puppet troops and the mercenary troops from the demilitarized zone and the entire territory of South Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences caused by their military adventurism.

	The statement points out that after large numbers of U.S.-puppet troops invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone, they are carrying out extremely savage massacres and persecutions, and are speeding up the plan to drive out 10,000 residents of this area from their villages, in an attempt to create a "no-man's-land" along the temporary military demarcation line, and to prepare for a new ground invasion of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	The statement points out that this action of the U.S. imperialists is concurrent with the continuous air raids by U.S. aggressor planes on Hanoi and Haiphong. This is another extremely serious new step to escalate the war taken by the U.S. imperialists to salvage their thorough defeat in South Vietnam.

	The statement points out that the U.S. imperialists have expanded their ground war to the entire territory of South Vietnam, and even to the threshold of the north—the southern part of the demilitarized zone. This action completely violates the regulations of the demilitarized zone and the Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue, and is a wanton provocation to the people of South and North Vietnam and to all peace-loving people in the world.

	The statement says that the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam fully endorses the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 21, 1967, strongly condemns the above-mentioned blatant warlike actions of the U.S. imperialists, and firmly demands that the U.S. imperialists must immediately and unconditionally stop bombing and strafing Hanoi, Haiphong, and all the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, immediately withdraw all their military forces from the southern part of the demilitarized zone and the entire territory of South Vietnam, and immediately stop the plan to persecute and concentrate residents in the demilitarized zone.

	The statement appeals to all governments and peoples of the world who love peace and progress, including the American people, to take more effective measures to stop the new U.S. imperialist steps to escalate the war and force it to stop its aggression against Vietnam.

	Hanoi, May 24 (New China News Agency) The Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front issued a statement on May 23 strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists for dispatching large numbers of U.S.-puppet troops to invade the demilitarized zone and expand the war.

	The statement points out that this is an extremely serious new step to escalate the war taken by the U.S. imperialists, a blatant violation of the regulations of the demilitarized zone, a serious violation of the 1954 Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue, a direct threat to the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and a wanton provocation to world public opinion.

	The statement says that the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front fully supports the statement issued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on May 21, 1967, and the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 19, 1967, and severely condemns the extremely dangerous war-expanding actions of the U.S. imperialists.

	The statement sternly warns the U.S. imperialists: The more they escalate the war, the more they will arouse the hatred of the Vietnamese people. Every step the U.S. imperialists take to escalate the war will inevitably meet with deserved punishment. The statement says that no matter how brutal and cunning the actions of the U.S. imperialists are, they cannot shake the iron will of the Vietnamese people to defeat the U.S. aggressors.

	The statement calls on all the Vietnamese people to further carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism, to be always on the alert, to press forward to victory, and to strike hard at the U.S. aggressors, and to resolutely fight to the end for complete victory.

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the Vietnam "People's Daily" published an editorial on May 22 condemning the U.S. imperialists for dispatching large numbers of U.S.-puppet troops to invade the demilitarized zone, and sternly warned the U.S. aggressors: Every step they take to escalate the war will inevitably meet with deserved retaliation. It was so in the past, and it will be so in the future. Facing the mad actions of the U.S. aggressors, the Vietnamese people have the right to take all necessary measures to stop their evil actions.

	The editorial points out that the new war-expanding action of the U.S. aggressors to dispatch large numbers of troops to the demilitarized zone harbors incalculable consequences.

	The editorial points out: The new step to escalate the war taken by the U.S. aggressors is precisely the desperate and stupid action they take when they are at their wit's end. This action will make them fail more quickly. The Vietnamese people have made full preparations. Expanding the war is the road to death for the U.S. aggressors.

    南越民族解放阵线强烈谴责美帝侵入非军事区
    南越军民决心惩罚美帝一切战争“升级”步骤
    越南祖国战线号召人民乘胜前进狠狠打击美国侵略者
    新华社河内二十三日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团二十二日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣美伪军大规模侵犯非军事区南部。声明庄严宣布：越南南方人民和解放武装力量完全有权采取适当的措施来惩罚美国强盗的一切战争“升级”步骤，把美伪军和帮凶军彻底赶出非军事区和整个越南南方领土。美帝国主义必须对由于它的军事冒险行动所引起的严重后果承担全部责任。
    声明指出，大批美伪军侵入非军事区南部以后，正在进行极端野蛮的屠杀和迫害活动，加紧推行把这个地区的一万名居民赶出他们的村庄的计划，妄图沿临时军事分界线建立一个“无人地带”，并且为从地面上对越南民主共和国发动新的侵略进攻作准备。
    声明指出，美帝国主义的这一行动是和美国强盗飞机接连袭击河内和海防的同时发生的。这是美帝国主义为挽救它在越南南方的彻底失败而进行的又一次极其严重的新的战争“升级”。
    声明指出，美帝国主义把它在地面上的战争扩大到整个越南南方领土，甚至扩大到紧靠北方的门槛——非军事区南部。它的这一行动彻底地破坏了非军事区的规定和关于越南问题的日内瓦协议，是对越南南北两方人民和全世界爱好和平人民的蛮横挑衅。
    声明说，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团完全赞同越南民主共和国政府一九六七年五月二十一日的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义的上述明目张胆的好战行动，坚决要求美帝国主义必须立即无条件地停止轰炸、扫射河内、海防和越南民主共和国的所有领土，立即把它的军事力量全部撤出非军事区南部和整个越南南方，立即停止在非军事区迫害和集中居民的计划。
    声明呼吁全世界爱好和平和进步的各国政府和人民，包括美国人民，采取更有力的措施，以制止美帝国主义的新的战争“升级”行动，迫使它停止侵略越南。
    新华社河内二十四日电　越南祖国战线中央委员会二十三日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣美伪军大规模进犯非军事区的扩大战争的罪行。
    声明指出，这是美帝国主义采取的极其严重的新的战争“升级”行动，是对非军事区规定的明目张胆的破坏，是对一九五四年关于越南问题的日内瓦协议的严重破坏，是对越南民主共和国领土的直接威胁，是对世界舆论的蛮横挑衅。
    声明说，越南祖国战线中央委员会完全支持越南民主共和国政府一九六七年五月二十一日的声明和外交部一九六七年五月十九日的声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义的扩大战争的极其危险的行动。
    声明严厉警告美帝国主义：它越是进行战争“升级”，就越激起越南人民的仇恨。美帝国主义的每一次战争“升级”，都必将遭到应得的惩罚。声明说，美帝国主义的任何残暴和狡诈行动，都不能动摇越南人民决心战胜美国侵略强盗的钢铁意志。
    声明号召全体越南人民进一步发扬革命英雄主义精神，时刻提高警惕，乘胜前进，狠狠地打击美国强盗，坚决把战斗进行到彻底胜利。
    据新华社河内电　越南《人民报》二十二日就美帝国主义悍然派遣美伪军大规模进犯非军事区发表社论，严正警告美国侵略者：它的每一个战争“升级”行动，都必将遭到应得的还击。过去如此，今后仍然如此。面对美国侵略者的疯狂行动，越南人民有权采取一切必要的措施来制止它的罪恶行动。
    社论指出，美国侵略者向非军事区大规模派遣军队这一新的扩大战争的行动，孕育着不可估量的后果。
    社论指出：美国侵略者的新的“升级”行动，正是它陷于穷途末路而采取的冒险和愚蠢的行动。这一行动将使它更快地走向彻底失败。越南人民已经作好了充分的准备。扩大战争就是美国强盗的死路。
