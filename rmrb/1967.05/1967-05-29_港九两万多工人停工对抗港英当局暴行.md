The Workers' Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee issued a statement, strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for sending agents to persecute workers. The statement pointed out that the British authorities' attempt to suppress the magnificent patriotic anti-imperialist movement is sheer fantasy!

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on May 28, the British authorities in Hong Kong are actively plotting new persecutions and arrests of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. The British authorities' determination to oppose the four million Chinese people in Hong Kong has sparked great anger among the people of Hong Kong. From May 23 to 26, over 20,000 workers from 13 enterprises and units in Hong Kong and Kowloon have taken strike actions to resist the fascist atrocities of the British authorities.

After the British authorities created a series of bloody incidents, they issued several so-called "emergency decrees," attempting to carry out large-scale arrests and persecutions. On May 26, the British "Governor" David Trench brazenly announced that he could not accept the five demands from the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the four demands from the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is reported that the British authorities are preparing to launch new fascist persecutions against the "Leftist Trade Union Council." On May 26, the British authorities intensified their persecution of the 1,800 seamen and workers at the Oil Street Ferry Company, which controls eight ferry routes and all car ferry routes. They openly sent plainclothes agents on board to monitor the workers, attempting to sabotage their anti-persecution struggle.

Facing the fascist atrocities and new suppression measures of the British authorities, starting from May 23, the Hong Kong bus workers took the lead in striking. Subsequently, workers from the Kowloon buses, Hong Kong trams, Taikoo Dockyard, Kowloon Dockyard, Post Office, Marine Department, China Light & Power Co., Ltd., China Gas Company, Hong Kong Electric Company, Star Ferry, Dairy Farm, and Taikoo Sugar Refinery also joined the strike protests, forming a force of over 20,000 workers against persecution. During the strike, workers loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations, sang revolutionary songs, and posted big-character posters and protest letters on buses, trams, ferries, and factory walls.

When the postal workers went on strike for the first time in history, all mail deliveries were halted. The British "Governor's Office" hurriedly sent out 200 letters, which were left untouched by the angry postal workers for 30 hours. After the Chinese workers at the Marine Department went on strike, all the British authorities' "anti-smuggling boats," port engineering repair ships, and transport ships were paralyzed. On May 25, the workers at the Dairy Farm stopped supplying milk and food to the British residents in the luxurious Peak District, causing panic among the British, who asked, "Should we return to London?"

The British authorities, frightened by the just struggle of the Hong Kong workers, used violence, threats, instigated American and Kuomintang agents to sabotage, and colluded with the management to exert pressure, using both soft and hard tactics to try to suppress and sabotage the workers' just struggle. However, these conspiracies all failed miserably in the face of the heroic workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. On May 23, three "riot control" vehicles full of thugs drove to the gate of the Hong Kong bus depot. Fully armed thugs menacingly approached the bus workers who were on strike, preparing to launch tear gas and wooden bullets. At that moment, the enraged workers jumped onto the vehicles, started the engines, and prepared to charge at the fascist thugs, scaring the thugs away in their "riot control" vehicles. The next day, the British authorities instigated American and Kuomintang agents to deceive some workers and, under police escort, forcibly drove out a few buses. However, this plot was quickly exposed by the workers, and the drivers firmly drove the buses back to the depot.

When the postal workers went on strike, the British authorities colluded with the "authorities" of the Post Office to issue two so-called "orders," threatening the workers with "suspension of wages" and "disciplinary actions." However, the workers firmly resisted, immediately held a meeting, and angrily denounced the British authorities' fascist bloody atrocities. In the end, the "authorities" had to withdraw the two so-called "orders." On the evening of May 27, the seamen and workers of the Oil Street Ferry Company held a rally, angrily exposing the persecution by British agents and resolutely declaring to carry the anti-persecution struggle to the end together with workers from all trades.

The just actions of the Hong Kong workers have received enthusiastic praise and support from the people of Hong Kong. In recent days, people from all walks of life have come to express their support to the workers. The people praised the workers, saying, "Your actions have greatly diminished the arrogance of imperialism and greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people. Your actions are excellent!"

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on May 28, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers' Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee issued a statement on May 27, strongly condemning the British authorities for sending plainclothes agents to monitor and persecute our patriotic workers. The statement demanded that the British authorities immediately withdraw all plainclothes agents from the Oil Street Ferry and all other places where they are present, and unconditionally accept the five demands from the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the four demands from the people of Hong Kong.

The statement said that on May 26, the British authorities sent plainclothes agents on board to monitor our Oil Street Ferry workers. Any worker with a sense of dignity cannot tolerate this. The statement said that they thought they could suppress the magnificent patriotic anti-imperialist movement by sending a few plainclothes agents and "riot control" teams. This is sheer fantasy!

The statement concluded that the anti-persecution struggle is a result of your oppression, and the strike protests are a result of your oppression. We once again sternly warn the British authorities: if you use violence to persecute, we will violently resist; if you continue to persecute, we will persistently resist; if you expand your persecution, we will resist comprehensively. One day, you will become rats crossing the street, despised by everyone, and drowned in the vast ocean of the people's anger.

    港九两万多工人停工对抗港英当局暴行
    工人反迫害斗争委员会发表声明，严厉谴责港英当局派出特务迫害工人，指出港英当局要把波澜壮阔的爱国反帝运动压下来，完全是妄想！
    据新华社香港二十八日电　香港英国当局正在积极策划对我港九同胞进行新的迫害和搜捕的阴谋活动。港英当局这种决心与四百万香港中国同胞为敌的态度，激起了香港同胞极大的愤怒。从二十三日到二十六日四天内，香港和九龙已有十三个企业和单位的两万多名工人，先后采取了停工行动，对抗港英当局的法西斯暴行。
    港英当局制造了一系列流血事件以后，又连续颁布了几项所谓“紧急法令”，企图进行更大规模的搜捕和迫害。二十六日，港英“总督”戴麟趾竟悍然宣布对我外交部的五项要求和港九同胞的四项要求“不能接受”。有消息透露，港英当局正准备向“左派工联会”进行新的法西斯迫害。二十六日，港英当局加紧对掌握八条港九渡轮航线和全部汽车渡轮航线的油麻地小轮公司一千八百名海员和工人进行迫害，公然派遣便衣特务上船监视工人，妄图破坏他们的反迫害斗争。
    面对港英当局的法西斯暴行和新的镇压措施，从二十三日开始，香港公共汽车工人首先采取停工行动，接着，九龙公共汽车、香港电车、太古船坞、九龙船坞工人，以及邮政局、海事处、中华电力有限公司、中华煤气公司、香港电灯公司、天星渡海小轮、牛奶公司和太古糖厂等单位的工人，也纷纷参加停工抗议行动，组成了二万多名工人的反迫害大军。工人们在停工的时间内，高声朗读毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲，把一张张的大字报、抗议书贴到公共汽车、电车、渡海小轮上，以及厂房等处。
    在邮务工人实行有史以来第一次停工的时候，所有邮件停止递送。港英“总督府”匆匆忙忙投寄二百封信件，也被愤怒的邮务工人弃置一旁达三十小时。港英当局另一个机构海事处的中国工人采取停工行动以后，使港英当局的“缉私船”、港口工程修理船、运输船等全部陷于瘫痪。牛奶公司工人二十五日停止向住在山顶区豪华住宅的英国人供应牛奶和伙食，使那里的英国人惊恐万状，纷纷询问：“要不要返伦敦？”
    被香港工人的正义斗争吓破了胆的港英当局，使用了暴力威胁、指使美蒋特务破坏和勾结资方施加压力等等卑劣手段，软硬兼施，妄图镇压和破坏工人的正义斗争。但是，这些阴谋诡计在用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄的工人面前都遭到可耻的失败。二十三日，三辆满载暴徒的“防暴车”开到香港公共汽车厂的门口，全副武装的暴徒气势汹汹地向着正在进行停工斗争的公共汽车工人进逼，作出施放催泪弹和木弹的架势。当时，气炸了肺的工人一个个跳上车，开动马达，准备向法西斯暴徒冲去，吓得这班暴徒慌忙爬上“防暴车”，夹着尾巴溜掉。第二天，港英当局又指使美蒋特务欺骗一些工人，并由警车监押，强行开出了几部公共汽车。但是，这个阴谋很快就被工人识破，出车的工人坚决把车驶回厂。
    当邮务工人进行停工斗争的时候，港英当局勾结邮政局的“当权人”先后发出两道所谓“通令”，以“停发工资”和采取“纪律处分”来威胁工人。但是，工人们坚决斗争，立即召开大会，愤怒声讨港英当局的法西斯血腥暴行。最后，这个“当权人”不得不自动收回这两道所谓“通令”。油麻地小轮公司的海员和工人二十七日晚举行了誓师大会，愤怒地控诉港英特务的迫害，坚决表示要同各业工人一道，把反迫害斗争进行到底。
    香港工人的正义行动受到香港各界广大同胞的热烈赞扬和支持。连日来，各界同胞纷纷前来向工人进行慰问。同胞们翘起大拇指赞扬工人说：“你们的行动大灭了帝国主义的威风，大长了中国人民的志气。你们的行动好得很！”
    据新华社香港二十八日电　港九各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会二十七日发表声明，严厉谴责港英当局派出便衣特务监视、迫害我爱国工人，要求港英当局立即从油麻地小轮以及一切有便衣特务的地方，撤回所有的便衣特务，并且要无条件接受我外交部五项要求和香港各界同胞的四项要求。
    声明说，五月二十六日，港英当局竟然宣布派出便衣特务上船监视我油麻地小轮工人。凡是有血性的港九工人，都是绝不能容忍的。声明说，他们以为派出几个便衣走狗和“防暴队”就可以把波澜壮阔的爱国反帝运动压下来。这完全是妄想！
    声明最后说，反迫害斗争是你们压迫出来的，停工抗议行动也是你们压迫出来的。我们再次严厉警告港英当局：你们暴力迫害，我们就暴力反抗；你们不断迫害，我们就持久反抗；你们扩大迫害，我们就全面反抗。你们终有一天将成为过街老鼠，人人喊打，淹没在群众愤怒的汪洋大海之中。
