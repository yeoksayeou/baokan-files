The Mongolian revisionist authorities, acting as hired thugs of the Soviet revisionists, brazenly beat our personnel stationed in Mongolia and overseas Chinese students and teachers. Our diplomatic personnel and overseas Chinese fearlessly fought back against the violence. Our embassy has lodged the strongest protest against the Mongolian revisionists' anti-China atrocities and demanded an immediate apology.

New China News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, May 22 — The Mongolian revisionist authorities recently expelled three overseas Chinese teachers in Ulaanbaatar without reason. On the 21st, when overseas Chinese students and teachers and Chinese embassy diplomats went to the train station to see off the three teachers, the authorities mobilized a large number of military and police to carry out a bloody suppression, creating a horrifying fascist incident of beating, arresting, and detaining our diplomatic personnel, Xinhua News Agency staff, and a large number of overseas Chinese. This is one of the most serious anti-China incidents deliberately planned and organized by the Mongolian revisionist leadership under the command of the Soviet revisionists.

The three overseas Chinese teachers expelled by the Mongolian revisionist authorities were Wang Zhiyun, Chen Lu, and Zuo Guiyi from the Overseas Chinese Primary School in Ulaanbaatar. A few days ago, the Mongolian revisionist authorities groundlessly accused them of "leading students to kick the door of the Mongolian News Agency" and "violating Mongolian law," etc. This is completely a fabrication by the Mongolian revisionist authorities to incite anti-China incidents. The fact is: the courtyard where the Overseas Chinese Primary School is located is jointly used by the Overseas Chinese Association and the Mongolian News Agency, and the door is also jointly used by both parties. However, the Mongolian side unilaterally closed the door, preventing the students from entering and exiting. In this situation, the students knocked on the door, and the Mongolian revisionist authorities used the above excuse to announce the expulsion of the three overseas Chinese teachers without reason. The Mongolian revisionist authorities' shameless behavior fully exposed their hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and their fear of overseas Chinese teachers spreading the great and boundless thoughts of Chairman Mao to the children of overseas Chinese.

After announcing the expulsion of the overseas Chinese teachers, the Mongolian revisionist authorities further plotted anti-China incidents. On the morning of the 20th, the First Deputy Minister of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, Toyev, summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, Liu Jide, and demanded that no farewell gathering be held at the station for Wang Zhiyun and others, which was immediately rejected by the Chargé d'Affaires.

In the afternoon of the 21st, overseas Chinese students and teachers went to the Ulaanbaatar train station in an orderly manner to see off Wang Zhiyun and the other two. Those present to see them off included diplomats and staff from the Chinese Embassy in Mongolia, representatives from the Chinese Construction Engineering Company in Mongolia, the Friendship Hospital, and the Overseas Chinese Association, totaling more than 200 people. After presenting flowers to Wang Zhiyun and the others, they read aloud quotations from Chairman Mao. At this time, a large number of Mongolian police who had been pre-positioned at the station rushed into the crowd and started arresting people. The revolutionary overseas Chinese students and teachers sang the "Internationale" and shouted slogans such as "Long live the unity of the peoples of China and Mongolia!" and "Long live, ten thousand times long live, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao!" They fearlessly engaged in reasoned struggle with the Mongolian revisionist police.

More and more Mongolian police arrived, and they, together with a large number of plainclothes agents wearing dark glasses and tilted hats, started beating and arresting overseas Chinese students and teachers indiscriminately. Many female students, some only in their teens, were also beaten to the ground. More than 20 overseas Chinese students, residents, and Overseas Chinese Association staff were illegally arrested by the Mongolian revisionist police, including seven minors, the youngest of whom was only 14 years old.

At the scene, Chinese embassy diplomats repeatedly protested to Mongolian officials, demanding that they immediately stop such savage acts. However, the Mongolian revisionist police and agents not only ignored the protests but also attacked the embassy personnel, severely violating diplomatic customs and illegally detaining embassy staff who had come to see them off. They were: Third Secretary Gu Shirong, Jiang Zhenzhong, Attaché Wang Zhonghua, Zhang Delin, embassy staff member Bai Jinfu, and Xinhua News Agency staff member Sun Chengping. Gu Shirong, Jiang Zhenzhong, and Zhang Delin were each grabbed by four or five Mongolian police, who twisted their arms and pulled their clothes, pushing them forward for about 30 to 40 meters in an attempt to lock them up in a temporary detention center. Wang Zhonghua, Bai Jinfu, and Sun Chengping were illegally detained for one and a half hours before being released after repeated serious demands. Wang Zhonghua was beaten by more than ten police, his buttons were torn off, and his pen was broken. When he showed his diplomatic identity card, the Mongolian police still ignored him and threatened him with fists. Bai Jinfu was pushed to the ground by seven or eight police, who stepped on him and choked him, tying his hands behind his back with a belt. Preliminary diagnosis showed that Wang Zhonghua had bruises on his upper chest and rib area, and subcutaneous hematoma formation. Bai Jinfu had a mild concussion, shoulder and wrist joint injuries, subcutaneous hematoma formation, and skin bruises on both shoulders and wrists. Sun Chengping's arm was injured, and his camera was also seized.

During the police's rampage, the Deputy Director of the Mongolian National Police Department and Director of the Ulaanbaatar Police Department, Colonel Ailinqinghuoluo, personally led the operation, deploying hundreds of police and plainclothes agents. Four or five senior police officers were on the scene directing the operation. The entire Ulaanbaatar train station was filled with the white terror of Mongolian revisionist police and agents arresting and beating Chinese personnel.

Facing the fascist atrocities of the Mongolian revisionist police and agents, our overseas Chinese students and diplomatic personnel showed great courage. They always held high the revolutionary book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" They engaged in reasoned struggle with the Mongolian revisionists. The detained students in the temporary detention center in the corridor and staircase of the office on the second floor of the station were beaten so badly that some were spitting blood, and their "Quotations from Chairman Mao" were illegally seized by the police. However, they remained spirited and repeatedly recited: "Make up your mind, don't be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They showed the heroic spirit of fearlessness in the face of violence.

There were many Mongolian friends at the scene who sympathized with the Chinese friends who were brutally suppressed by the Mongolian police. Some even stepped forward to protect the persecuted Chinese friends. One Mongolian friend was arrested by the Mongolian police for protecting a Chinese friend.

At the time of the incident, the First Deputy Minister of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, Toyev, was also at the station directing the operation from behind the scenes. After the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Liu Jide rushed to the scene, he intended to negotiate with him, but this cunning man avoided meeting with the Chargé d'Affaires. Liu Jide then strongly protested to the Deputy Director of the Mongolian National Police Department and Director of the Ulaanbaatar Police Department, Ailinqinghuoluo.

Ailinqinghuoluo, under the stern questioning of our Chargé d'Affaires, admitted that the Mongolian police had illegally beaten and detained our diplomatic personnel and acknowledged that the overseas Chinese students and teachers waving "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans, and holding a farewell ceremony were reasonable. But he tried to justify himself, saying that the incident happened because someone in the crowd pushed a policeman with a red book first.

After returning to the embassy, Liu Jide immediately called to urgently request a meeting with the First Deputy Minister of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, Toyev, or any representative of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, and then went to the Mongolian Foreign Ministry in person to wait. Due to their guilt and fear, the Mongolian side used the excuse that it was a Sunday and did not conduct business, refusing to receive him. It was not until 11:45 PM that Liu Jide saw the Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Mongolian Foreign Ministry, Tumen. Liu Jide pointed out to Tumen that this was a serious anti-China political incident deliberately planned by the Mongolian side, a great insult and serious violation of the personal safety of the Chinese embassy's diplomatic personnel, a brutal persecution of Chinese overseas citizens, and a serious step to worsen relations between the two countries. The Chinese embassy expressed great indignation and lodged the strongest and most serious protest against the Mongolian government, demanding the following three points:

1. Immediately release all Chinese citizens illegally detained by the Mongolian side;
2. Apologize to all Chinese personnel who were beaten and detained;
3. Immediately take effective measures to ensure the safety of embassy personnel and Chinese citizens and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again.

The Mongolian side must bear all the serious consequences arising from this incident.

    蒙修当局充当苏修打手悍然毒打我驻蒙人员和华侨师生
    我外交人员和华侨不畏强暴英勇斗争
    我大使馆最强烈抗议蒙修反华暴行，要求立即赔礼道歉
    新华社乌兰巴托二十二日电　蒙古修正主义当局最近无理驱逐在乌兰巴托的三名华侨教师，并在二十一日，当华侨师生和中国使馆外交人员在火车站为三名华侨教师送行时，出动大批军警，进行血腥镇压，制造了殴打、拘捕、扣留我外交人员、新华分社工作人员和大批华侨的骇人听闻的法西斯事件。这是蒙修领导集团长期以来在苏修指挥下，有计划、有组织地蓄意制造的极其严重的反华事件之一。
    被蒙修当局无理驱逐的是乌兰巴托华侨小学的教师王治云、陈禄、左贵义。蒙修当局几天前毫无根据地诬蔑他们“带领学生踢打《蒙古消息报》报社大门”，“破坏了蒙古法律”等。这完全是蒙修当局恣意造谣，为煽动反华事件制造借口。事实是：设有华侨小学的大院是华侨协会和《蒙古消息报》报社共同使用的，大门也是两家共同使用的，但是蒙方无理单方面把大门关死，不让学生出入。在这种情况下，学生敲了门，蒙修当局便以上述借口无理宣布驱逐三位华侨教师。蒙修当局的这种无耻行为充分暴露了它们敌视中国人民的嘴脸，暴露了它们害怕华侨教师向侨胞子弟宣传伟大的光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    蒙修当局在无理宣布驱逐华侨教师后，又进一步策划反华事件。二十日上午，蒙古外交部第一副部长托依夫约见我驻蒙古大使馆临时代办刘吉德，提出不得在车站为王治云等举行欢送集会的无理要求，当场遭到我临时代办的断然拒绝。
    二十一日下午三时许，华侨师生秩序井然地前往乌兰巴托车站为王治云等三人送行。到车站送行的还有我驻蒙古大使馆的外交官员和工作人员、中国建筑工程公司驻蒙公司和友谊医院、华侨协会代表等共二百余人。送行者向王治云等献花以后，齐声朗读毛主席语录。这时，预先布置在车站上的大批蒙古警察就横冲直撞地进入人群动手捕人。革命的华侨师生高唱《国际歌》，高呼“中蒙两国人民团结万岁！”“我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”等口号，毫无惧色地同蒙修警察展开了说理斗争。
    蒙古警察越来越多，他们会同大批戴黑眼镜和歪帽子的特务，大打出手，对华侨师生拳打脚踢，乱加逮捕。许多只有十几岁的女学生也被打倒在地。被蒙修警察无理逮捕的华侨师生、侨民和华侨协会干部达二十余名，其中有七名是未成年的小学生，而最小的一名只有十四岁。
    当时在场的中国大使馆外交人员一再向蒙古警官提出强烈抗议，坚决要求他们立即停止这种野蛮暴行。但是蒙修警察和特务对此不仅置之不理，反而动手扭打我外交人员，并严重违反外交惯例，非法拘捕前往送行的使馆人员，他们是：三等秘书顾世荣、姜振忠，随员汪忠华、张德麟，大使馆工作人员白进福，以及新华社工作人员孙承平。顾世荣、姜振忠、张德麟三人都各被蒙修警察四、五人反扭双手，扯住衣服，向前推押了三四十米，企图把他们关进临时拘留处。汪忠华、白进福、孙承平三同志被蒙修警察非法扣押达一个半小时之久，经一再严正要求后始释放。汪忠华被十多个警察拳打脚踢押进临时拘留处，衣服钮扣都被撕掉，钢笔被打断。当他出示外交官身份证时，蒙修警察仍然不予理睬，并举拳威胁。白进福被七、八个警察按倒在地。警察用脚踩在他身上，并卡住他的脖子，用皮带反绑他的双手。据初步诊断，汪忠华上侧胸部有打扑伤，上侧肋软骨区挫伤，皮下血肿形成。白进福轻度脑震荡，双肩关节及腕关节勒伤，皮下血肿形成，两肩及两腕皮肤挫伤。孙承平的胳膊被扭伤，照相机也被抢走。
    蒙警行凶时，蒙古国家警察总局副局长兼乌兰巴托警察局局长上校艾林青浩尔洛亲自上阵，出动了成百名警察和便衣特务，有四、五名校级警官在现场具体指挥。整个乌兰巴托火车站充满了蒙修警察和特务抓捕扭打中国人员的一片白色恐怖。
    面对蒙修警察和特务的法西斯暴行，我华侨师生和驻外人员表现得非常英勇，他们始终高高举着革命宝书《毛主席语录》，高呼“毛主席万岁”等口号，同蒙修展开说理斗争。被捕的师生在蒙修设在车站二楼办公室走廊楼梯口的临时拘留处中，有的虽被打得口吐鲜血，他们的《毛主席语录》都被警察无理抢走，但仍斗志昂扬，不断背诵：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们表现了不畏强暴的英雄气概。
    在场有不少蒙古朋友对被蒙修警察血腥镇压的中国朋友表示同情，有的人挺身出来保护被迫害的中国朋友，有一个蒙古朋友因为保护中国朋友而被蒙古警察捕走。
    暴行发生的当时，蒙古外交部第一副部长托依夫，也在车站进行幕后指挥。中国驻蒙古使馆临时代办刘吉德赶赴现场后，曾打算找他交涉，这个狡猾的家伙一直避而不敢同刘代办见面。刘吉德临时代办于是向蒙古国家警察总局副局长兼乌兰巴托警察局局长艾林青浩尔洛，提出了最强烈的抗议。
    艾林青浩尔洛在我临时代办严词责问下理屈词穷，被迫承认蒙古警察非法殴打和拘捕了我外交人员，承认我华侨师生挥动《毛主席语录》、呼口号，举行欢送仪式是合情合理的。但他又进行狡辩，胡说什么这次事件是因为人群中有人先用红书推了警察才发生的。
    刘吉德临时代办返回使馆后立即打电话紧急约见蒙古外交部第一副部长托依夫，或蒙古外交部任何一个代表，然后又亲自去蒙古外交部门厅等候，当面要求外交部门卫协助联系。但蒙方由于理亏心虚，借口星期日不办公，拒绝接见。一直到深夜十一时四十五分，刘吉德临时代办才见到蒙古外交部礼宾司副司长图门。刘吉德临时代办向图门指出，这是蒙古方面预谋的有计划制造的极其严重的反华政治事件，是对中国大使馆外交人员的莫大侮辱和人身安全的严重侵犯，是对中国侨民的残酷迫害，是蓄意恶化两国关系的严重步骤。对此，中国大使馆表示极大的愤慨，对蒙古政府提出最强烈最严重的抗议，并提出以下三项要求：
    一、立即全部释放被蒙方无理逮捕的我国公民；
    二、向遭受毒打和被扣押的全部中国人员赔礼道歉；
    三、立即采取有效措施保障使馆人员和中国公民的安全，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    对这一事件产生的一切严重后果必须由蒙古方面全部承担。
