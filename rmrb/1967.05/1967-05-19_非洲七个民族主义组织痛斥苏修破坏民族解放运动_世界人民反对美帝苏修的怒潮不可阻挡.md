In Cairo, representatives of seven African nationalist organizations recently issued a joint statement strongly condemning the Soviet modern revisionist leadership for colluding with American imperialism and sabotaging the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

The statement pointed out: "The Soviet modern revisionists, frightened by the people's wars of national liberation against American imperialism in Vietnam and elsewhere, are shamelessly cooperating with the American aggressors, acting as their faithful lackeys, and sabotaging the struggles of the peoples of various countries for national liberation and against American imperialism." The statement quoted Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no formidable power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

The statement pointed out: "The tide of the world's people opposing the American aggressors and their chief accomplice, the Soviet revisionists, is irresistible. The struggle against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and their lackeys and running dogs will certainly achieve greater victories."

    非洲七个民族主义组织痛斥苏修破坏民族解放运动
    世界人民反对美帝苏修的怒潮不可阻挡
    据新华社开罗电　在开罗的七个非洲民族主义组织的代表不久前联合发表声明，强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，破坏越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
    声明指出：“被越南和其他地方的反对美帝国主义的人民解放战争吓破了胆的苏联现代修正主义者，正在无耻地同美国侵略者合作，充当他们的忠实走狗，破坏各国人民争取民族解放和反对美帝国主义的斗争。”声明引用毛主席的教导说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    声明指出：“世界人民反对美国侵略者及其头号帮凶苏联修正主义者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义及其仆从和走狗的斗争一定会取得更大的胜利。”
