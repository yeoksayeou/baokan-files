The heroic People's Liberation Army soldiers and officers are today vigilantly guarding the country's airspace, seas, and coastal and border defenses, protecting our billion laboring people as they celebrate the great victories of the proletarian revolutionary line led by Chairman Mao in the triumphant song of May Day, the International Labor Day.

Along the vast coastal and border defenses, soldiers and officers patrol day and night, closely watching the seas and skies, guarding the sentry posts, and standing ready to give the invading enemy a crushing blow. They read aloud Mao Zedong's quotations over and over again: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must never relax their fighting spirit. Any thought of relaxing the fighting spirit or underestimating the enemy is wrong."

In the early morning, news of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's May Day message reached the coastal and border defenses. The soldiers and officers, who have boundless love, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, were overjoyed and enthusiastically cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" Vice Chairman Lin Biao's message has greatly boosted the morale of the soldiers and officers. They are full of fighting spirit and high morale, determined to make new contributions to safeguarding the country's security and the glorious cause of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On the front lines in Fujian, the "Sea Tigers" that dominate the seas set sail on the night of the holiday. The warships cut through the waves, patrolling the rolling sea surface. The radar operators, sentries, and coastal artillery soldiers are all at their battle stations, watching the sea and sky; the brave airmen are standing by their fighter jets, ready to take off and intercept the enemy. The commanders of the units stationed on the front-line islands have gone to the front lines to stand guard with the soldiers. They spend day and night in the front-line observation posts, observing the enemy-occupied islands with the soldiers, ready to smash any invasion by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandits at any time.

In the South China Sea in May, the sun is scorching, and the heat is oppressive. The anti-aircraft artillery soldiers, who have weathered many storms, have just finished a drill. Suddenly, an alarm sounds, and two batches of enemy aircraft and an aircraft carrier are approaching our territorial waters. The alarm is a command, and the soldiers immediately take up their battle positions, ready for combat. Despite being sweating profusely under the sun-baked gun seats, the soldiers remain spirited and vigilant, keeping a close eye on the enemy's movements. The news of another victory, with two more American aggressor planes shot down, has greatly encouraged them. The naval unit known as the "Eyes of the Motherland" is celebrating its sixteenth May Day on their mountain today. The operators are intently observing and analyzing every tiny echo on the radar screen. They say: Although we are not sent to support the broad masses of the left, we stand guard at the radar screens every day, protecting the southern gate of the motherland, and are carrying out the glorious task of supporting the left.

    林彪副统帅的“五一”题词给指战员增添巨大力量 
    英雄的解放军百倍警惕保卫祖国
    据新华社一日讯　英雄的人民解放军广大指战员，今天百倍警惕地守卫着祖国的领空、领海和海防、边防线，保卫我国亿万劳动人民在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，欢度“五一”国际劳动节。
    在祖国漫长的海防、边防线上，指战员们昼夜警惕地巡逻着，严密注视着海空，守卫着哨卡，时刻准备给来犯的敌人以迎头痛击。他们一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席语录：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”
    凌晨，林彪副统帅为“五一”节题词的消息传到了海防和边防线上。对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜的指战员们欢欣鼓舞，热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”林彪副统帅的题词，给指战员们增添了巨大的力量。他们斗志昂扬，精神振奋，决心为保卫祖国安全、保卫祖国无产阶级文化大革命的光荣事业作出新的贡献。
    在福建前线，威镇海疆的“海上猛虎艇”在节日的夜晚出航了。战艇劈开巨浪，在波涛滚滚的海面上巡逻。担任节日值勤的雷达兵、哨兵和海岸炮手各就战位，注视着海空动静；英勇的空军健儿，守候在战鹰旁待命起飞迎击敌人。驻守在前沿岛屿的部队指挥员，纷纷深入第一线同战士一起执勤，他们日夜在前沿观察所里，同战士们并肩观察敌占岛屿上的动静，随时准备粉碎美蒋匪帮的侵犯。
    南海的五月，烈日当空，暑气逼人。饱经风雨的高射炮兵战士们刚刚演练完毕，忽然一阵警报，两批敌机、一艘航空母舰在向我领海方向驶近。警报就是命令，战士们立即进入战位，作好战斗准备。坐立在被太阳烤得灼热的炮座上的战士们，尽管汗流浃背，仍然斗志昂扬，精神振奋，警惕地注视着敌人的动静。兄弟部队传来的又击落美国强盗飞机两架的胜利消息，给了他们以巨大的鼓舞。被人们誉为“祖国警惕的眼睛”的海军某部四好观通站，今天已经是第十六次在他们的高山上度过“五一”国际劳动节了，操纵手们在荧光屏前聚精会神地观察和分析着每一个微小的回波。他们说：我们虽然没有被派去支持左派广大群众，但我们天天值勤在荧光屏前，守卫着祖国的南大门，就是执行着支左的光荣任务。
