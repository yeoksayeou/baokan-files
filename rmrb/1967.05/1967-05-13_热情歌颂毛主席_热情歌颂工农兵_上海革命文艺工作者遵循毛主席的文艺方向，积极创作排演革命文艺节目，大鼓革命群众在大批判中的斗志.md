Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses in Shanghai's literary and artistic circles are taking the great criticism as the key link, combining it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own units. They have actively created and performed a series of revolutionary literary and artistic programs that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. This is to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and to hail the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

Recently, our beloved great leader Chairman Mao watched the large-scale modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," created and performed by the Shanghai Dance School, in Beijing. This has greatly encouraged the revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Shanghai. They are determined to better follow Chairman Mao's direction for literature and art, which is "to create for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and to be used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." They aim "to make literature and art become an integral part of the entire revolutionary machine, serving as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy." Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and with the personal care and support of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Shanghai are using literary and artistic creation as a weapon in the current great criticism. They enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, boost the revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary masses, and launch a barrage of attacks against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The proletarian revolutionary forces and revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater have performed the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Harbor," which will now be presented to the audience in a new guise. This play reflects the struggles of Chinese dock workers in the 1960s, depicting the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the younger generation, and reflecting the struggle between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews. Through this struggle, it portrays the heroic image of Chinese workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically praising their great aspirations and revolutionary spirit to serve the Chinese people completely and thoroughly, and to serve the revolutionary people of the world.

At the same time as the Peking opera "The Harbor," the Shanghai Youth Peking Opera Troupe, Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, and New China Peking Opera Troupe will also perform the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Lantern." The Shanghai Huai Opera Troupe will also perform the same-named Huai opera based on the Peking opera script.

Following Chairman Mao's instructions on "learning from the past to serve the present, learning from foreign countries to serve China," and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," another brilliant model work created in the literary and artistic revolution, the symphonic music "Sha Jianhu," will also be performed by the Shanghai Youth Peking Opera Troupe, Chorus, Drama Academy, and Symphony Orchestra. The revolutionary young warriors of the drama school and the attached middle school of the music academy will also perform the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Sha Jianhu" with symphonic accompaniment. The dance school, film orchestra, chorus, and children's art theater will collaborate to perform "The Long March Suite." In addition, the revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Shanghai Experimental Opera House, together with the workers, have created the song and dance drama "January Storm" reflecting the January Revolution. The children's art theater, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Fudan University, drama school, and dance school have jointly created the new song and dance drama "Long Live the Red Guards." The Red Sun Dance Troupe is rehearsing the newly created "Red Lantern," and the Shanghai Acrobatic Troupe is actively arranging acrobatic and dance programs reflecting the "January Revolution."

    上海革命文艺工作者遵循毛主席的文艺方向，积极创作排演革命文艺节目，大鼓革命群众在大批判中的斗志
    据新华社上海十二日电　高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的上海文艺界的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，以大批判为纲，结合本单位的斗批改，积极创作排演了一批闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命文艺节目，庆祝伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，欢呼以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    最近，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席在北京观看了上海市舞蹈学校创作、演出的大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，给了上海革命的文艺工作者以极大的鼓舞。他们决心更好地遵循毛主席的“为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的”革命的文艺方向，“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，在江青同志亲自关怀和支持下，上海革命文艺工作者在当前的革命大批判中，以文艺创作为武器，热情宣传毛泽东思想，大鼓革命群众的革命斗志，万炮齐轰党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。上海京剧院的无产阶级革命派和革命群众排演的革命现代京剧《海港》，这次将以崭新的面目与观众见面。这出戏反映了六十年代中国码头工人的斗争生活，表现了无产阶级与资产阶级两个阶级争夺青年一代的斗争，反映了无产阶级与资产阶级两种世界观的斗争，并通过这场斗争塑造了用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人的英雄形象，热情地歌颂了他们完全、彻底地为中国人民服务，为世界革命人民服务的豪情壮志和革命胸怀。与京剧《海港》同时上演的，还有上海市青年京剧团、上海京剧院、新华京剧团分别排演的革命现代京剧样板戏《红灯记》，和上海市淮剧团据京剧剧本搬演的同名淮剧。
    遵循毛主席关于“古为今用，洋为中用”，“百花齐放，推陈出新”的指示，在文艺革命中创作出来的另一个光辉样板作品交响音乐《沙家浜》，也将由上海市青年京剧团、合唱团、戏剧学院和交响乐团联合演出。戏曲学校、音乐学院附中的革命小将发扬了敢想、敢说、敢干、敢革命、敢造反的精神，也将演出交响乐伴奏的革命现代京剧《沙家浜》。舞蹈学校、电影乐团、合唱团和儿童艺术剧院合作演出的《长征组舞》也将同时公演。此外，上海实验歌剧院的革命文艺工作者与工人结合，创作了反映一月革命的歌舞剧《一月风暴》，儿童艺术剧院、上海音乐学院、复旦大学、戏曲学校和舞蹈学校等单位合作新创了歌舞剧《英雄的红卫兵万岁》，红霞歌舞团正在排演新创作的《红灯照》，上海杂技团也正积极编排反映“一月革命”的杂技歌舞节目。
