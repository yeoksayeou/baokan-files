The Soviet revisionist leadership is extremely afraid of the spread of truth. Recently, they have unreasonably stopped the distribution of the "Beijing Weekly" and have intensified their efforts to block news from China to the Soviet people.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 6th, a spokesman for the Soviet magazine distribution agency "Soviet Press" admitted on the 4th that they have removed the "Beijing Weekly" from their distribution list. A report states that a direct subscriber to the "Beijing Weekly" living in Moscow has not received the issue sent from Beijing since last November.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has always been cowardly, extremely afraid of the spread of contemporary Marxism-Leninism at its highest level—the thoughts of Mao Zedong—in the Soviet Union, and dare not let the Soviet people hear the voices of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people. Since China launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have been even more terrified and enraged by the great changes taking place in China. Therefore, they have intensified their efforts to block news from China to the Soviet people.

    苏修对真理的传播怕得要命
    竟无理停销《北京周报》变本加厉向苏联人民封锁中国的消息
    据新华社六日讯　莫斯科消息：苏联修正主义领导集团十分害怕真理的传播，最近竟然无理停止经销《北京周报》，并且指使邮局扣发莫斯科订户订阅的《北京周报》。
    据报道，苏联的杂志经销机构“苏维埃报刊”社的一个发言人四日供认，它已经从自己的经销目录中取消了《北京周报》。据一则报道说，住在莫斯科的一个《北京周报》的直接订户，从去年十一月就没有收到从北京定期寄出的《北京周报》了。
    苏修领导集团从来都是胆小如鼠，十分害怕当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想在苏联的传播，不敢让苏联人民听到中国共产党和中国人民的声音。自从中国开展无产阶级文化大革命以来，它们对于在中国发生的伟大的变化更是怕得要死，恨得要命，因此变本加厉地向苏联人民封锁中国的消息。
