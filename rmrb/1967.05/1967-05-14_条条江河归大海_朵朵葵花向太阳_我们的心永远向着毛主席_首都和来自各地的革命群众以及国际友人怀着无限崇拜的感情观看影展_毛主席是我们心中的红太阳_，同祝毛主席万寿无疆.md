All rivers flow to the sea, all sunflowers face the sun. Our hearts forever belong to Chairman Mao. Revolutionary masses from the capital and various parts of the country, as well as international friends, watched the photo exhibition "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" with boundless admiration. They wish Chairman Mao eternal life.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 13th, the large-scale photo exhibition "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" has been enthusiastically welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and international friends from the capital and across the country since its grand opening on May 4. "All rivers flow to the sea, all sunflowers face the sun." Millions of revolutionary fighters, with their hearts filled with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao, have paid tribute to the radiant image of our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao.

In front of the exhibition hall filled with giant photos of Chairman Mao, the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians and revolutionary masses felt as if they were bathed in bright sunlight, immersed in an endless stream of happiness, and filled with boundless excitement and emotion. They could not contain their excitement and took up their pens to pour out their heartfelt praises and sincere wishes for the great leader Chairman Mao, writing down their solemn oaths to Chairman Mao. In the thick volumes of the guest book, thousands of words and songs condensed into a single sentence that best represents the common voice of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people: "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live, long live, and long live forever the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao!"

A soldier of the People's Liberation Army wrote in the guest book: "Seeing the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, my body is filled with boundless strength. I fear no difficulties or dangers and will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end! Seeing the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait, my heart is boundless, and the winds of five continents and the waves of four oceans roar in my chest. I want to be a revolutionary warrior of the world and dedicate my life to planting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the globe!" A poor peasant from Yan Shi, Henan, wrote: "Seeing Chairman Mao's giant portrait is like seeing the reddest sun in my heart. I am full of energy, and my revolutionary will is stronger. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow you to make revolution for life. Our heads may be cut off, and our blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought will never be abandoned!" Two young Red Guards from a middle school wrote: "After seeing your old portrait, we are greatly inspired and filled with boundless strength. We have so many heartfelt words to tell you and so many beautiful songs to sing for you. We will definitely take over the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. The sea may dry up, and the rocks may crumble, but our red hearts defending Mao Zedong Thought will never change." A revolutionary cadre wrote: "Dear Chairman Mao, you have received more than a thousand and one hundred thousand cultural revolution armies eight times. This is a great feat in the history of world communism. You are always heart to heart with us revolutionary masses, always with the revolutionary masses! I will always remember your old teachings: 'You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!' 'You should prioritize politics, go to the masses, and be with the masses to make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution better.'" The broad audience unanimously expressed that this is not a visit to an ordinary exhibition but a visit to receive the inspection of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. A revolutionary youth from Jiangsu wrote: "I was persecuted by the reactionary bourgeois line last year during the nationwide revolutionary tour and was unable to come to Beijing to receive Chairman Mao's inspection. In the fierce struggle between the two lines, I deeply felt that 'the revolution is closer to Beijing, and the rebellion is closer to Chairman Mao.' Today, I finally saw our reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, at this exhibition."

A revolutionary fighter from the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Stamp Factory, who was once persecuted by the reactionary bourgeois line and labeled as a "current counter-revolutionary," wrote: The persecution of the reactionary bourgeois line made me unable to receive Chairman Mao's inspection. This time, after seeing the photo exhibition, it was as if I had seen Chairman Mao. We followed Chairman Mao's teachings, achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" on the basis of criticizing the reactionary bourgeois line, and also achieved great victories in seizing the revolution and promoting production. Today, seeing Chairman Mao, we are more confident and powerful in our struggle against the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Many viewers also wrote poems to express their determination to follow Chairman Mao in making the revolution forever: "Sunflowers face the red sun, revolutionary fighters' hearts are with the Party, forever following Chairman Mao, the revolutionary path will not be lost." "The great works of four volumes are in hand, revolutionary truths are in the heart, forever following the chairman to make the revolution, swearing to spread the precious book to the five continents."

Foreign friends who visited the exhibition shared the same boundless admiration and excitement for our great leader Chairman Mao as our people. A reporter from the Albanian newspaper "Voice of the People," Hasan Beteri, wrote passionately: "Chairman Mao and the people are always heart to heart, and the hearts of hundreds of millions of people will forever be with the greatest and most glorious leader, Chairman Mao. The great Marxist-Leninist theory of Chairman Mao, the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, are worth learning from by all revolutionaries in the world. Chairman Mao's humility and his boundless love and trust for the people are great examples for all revolutionaries in the world to learn from." A Chilean foreign guest who had just participated in the China Export Commodities Fair in Guangzhou shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" while visiting the exhibition. He wrote: "We came to China at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China was fully developing. We saw China's rapid development at the Guangzhou Fair. Now, through this photo exhibition, we have personally seen the great image of Chairman Mao, feeling very fortunate. Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts that will never set!"

    我们的心永远向着毛主席
    首都和来自各地的革命群众以及国际友人怀着无限崇拜的感情观看影展“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”，同祝毛主席万寿无疆
    据新华社十三日讯　“毛主席是我们心中的红太阳”大型摄影展览，自五月四日在首都隆重开幕以来，受到首都和来自全国各地的广大工农兵、革命师生、革命干部和国际友人极其热烈的欢迎。“条条江河归大海，朵朵葵花向太阳。”千千万万的革命战士怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的强烈感情，瞻仰了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席伟大的光辉形象。
    在布满巨幅毛主席照片的展览大厅前，广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众如同沐浴着明亮的阳光，沉浸在无比幸福的暖流中，感到万分兴奋和激动。他们按捺不住万分激动的心情，挥笔疾书，倾吐自己对伟大领袖毛主席的热情歌颂和衷心祝愿，写下自己对伟大领袖毛主席的庄严的誓言。在厚达几百页的留言簿里，千言万语，千歌万曲，凝成一句最能代表亿万革命人民共同心声的话：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”“中国人民和世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    一位解放军战士，在留言簿上写道：“看见伟大领袖毛主席像，浑身增添了无穷的力量，千难万险何所惧，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！看见伟大领袖毛主席像，心胸无限宽广，胸怀响起五大洲的风雷，掀起四大洋的巨浪，我要做世界革命的战士，为全球插遍毛泽东思想伟大红旗贡献毕生的力量！”来自河南偃师的一位贫农社员写道：“看到毛主席的巨幅照片，如同见到心中最红最红的红太阳，浑身是劲，革命意志更坚强。毛主席啊，毛主席！我们贫下中农要一辈子跟您闹革命。头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！”两个中学红卫兵小将的誓言是：“看了您老人家的照片，我们得到了巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量，有多少贴心的话要向您老人家倾吐，有多少动听的歌要给您老人家歌唱。我们一定将无产阶级革命的班接过来，海可枯，石可烂，捍卫毛泽东思想的红心永不变。”一位革命干部写道：“敬爱的毛主席，您连续八次接见一千一百多万文化革命大军，这是世界共产主义运动历史上的伟大创举。您永远和我们革命群众心连心，永远和革命群众在一起！我要牢牢记住您老人家的谆谆教导：‘你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！’‘你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。’”广大观众一致表示，这不是参观普通的展览，而是来接受我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的检阅。一位来自江苏的革命小将写道：“我因受资产阶级反动路线的迫害，在去年全国革命大串连的时候，没有能够到北京接受毛主席的检阅。在激烈的两条路线斗争中我深切地体会到，‘革命尤知北京近，造反更觉主席亲’。今天我终于在这个展览会上见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。”曾经受资产阶级反动路线迫害、被打成“现行反革命”的北京邮票厂革命造反总部的一个革命战士写道：资产阶级反动路线的迫害使我没有机会受到毛主席检阅。这次看了影展，如同见到了毛主席。我们遵照毛主席的教导，在批判资产阶级反动路线的基础上，实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，在抓革命、促生产中也取得了很大胜利。今天看到毛主席，更增添了我们向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的必胜信心和力量。许多观众还提笔赋诗，表达自己永远跟着毛主席闹革命的决心：“葵花向着红太阳，革命战士心向党，永远跟着毛主席，革命大道不迷航。”“雄文四卷擎在手，革命真理记心头，永跟主席闹革命，誓把宝书传五洲。”
    参观影展的外国朋友同我国人民一样，对我们伟大领袖毛主席充满了无限敬仰的激动心情。来自欧洲伟大的社会主义堡垒——阿尔巴尼亚的《人民之声报》驻北京记者哈桑·贝特莱热情洋溢地写道：“毛主席和群众一直是心连心，亿万人民群众的心也永远向着最伟大、最光荣的领袖毛主席。毛主席的伟大的马克思列宁主义学说，毛主席的伟大思想，很值得全世界革命者学习。毛主席的谦逊，以及他对人民群众的无限热爱和信任，是全世界革命者学习的伟大榜样。”刚刚在广州参加过中国出口商品交易会的一位智利外宾，在参观影展时连声高呼“毛主席万岁！”他写道：“我们这次来中国，正是中国无产阶级文化大革命进入全面发展的时期。我们在广州交易会上，看到了中国飞跃的发展。现在通过这个影展，我们亲眼看到了毛主席的伟大形象，感到非常幸运。毛主席是我们心中永远永远不落的最红最红的红太阳！”
