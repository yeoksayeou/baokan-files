The beautiful dream of imperialism, revisionism, and counter-revolutionaries has shattered. The vast masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in China, as well as revolutionary youth, are enthusiastically carrying out the unprecedented, great proletarian cultural revolution. This great revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism centered around the leadership of the CPSU, and reactionaries in various countries.

We, the revolutionary youth of Brazil, are closely following this unprecedented great mass revolutionary movement with great concern. We firmly believe that this great struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm will end in victory for the proletariat.

At this moment when the Chinese Cultural Revolution is achieving victory after victory, the proletarian revolutionary factions who are carrying out Chairman Mao's revolutionary line have entered the stage of seizing power from the capitalist roaders within the Party and have exposed the chief backers of these counter-revolutionary revisionists. This has completely shattered the imperialists', modern revisionists', and world reactionaries' illusions of China returning to capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." This is a great truth of Marxism-Leninism.

Currently, the waves of world revolution are surging. The Vietnamese people are bravely fighting for national liberation against American aggression, and the anti-imperialist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are also rising. These struggles have awakened the people of these regions.

We are firmly convinced that the vast revolutionary masses of China, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, will "resolutely carry out the task, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to win victory." The victory of the Chinese people will be a great contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

At the time when the red sun rises in the east and happiness envelops the majestic Tiananmen Square, we pay our highest respects to the great leader Chairman Mao and the people of China.

    帝修反的美梦破灭了
    中国广大的工农兵群众以及革命的青少年正在热火朝天地进行着伟大的、史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场伟大的革命给予帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派沉重的打击。
    我们，巴西的革命青少年，以极大的关心注视着这场史无前例的伟大的群众革命运动。我们深信这场无产阶级与资产阶级在思想领域里的伟大斗争将以无产阶级的胜利而告终。
    在中国文化大革命节节胜利的时刻，执行毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命派进入了向党内走资本主义道路当权派夺权的阶段，并且挖出了这些反革命修正主义分子的总后台。这使帝国主义、现代修正主义和全世界反动派妄想中国回到资本主义的美梦彻底破灭了。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”这是马列主义的一条伟大的真理。
    目前，世界革命浪潮汹涌澎湃。越南人民正在英勇地进行抗美救国的正义斗争，亚非拉革命人民反帝斗争也在蒸蒸日上，唤起了这些地区人民的觉醒。
    我们坚信，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国广大的革命群众，一定会“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的。中国人民的胜利就是为世界的革命事业作出伟大的贡献。
    在东方升起红太阳的时候，在幸福笼罩着雄伟的天安门广场的时候，我们向伟大的领袖毛主席和中国人民致以崇高敬意。
