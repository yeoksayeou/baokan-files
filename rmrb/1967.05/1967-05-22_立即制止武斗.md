    Stop the Fighting Immediately

    In recent days, in some places, some units, and some mass organizations, a trend of armed fighting has emerged. It disrupts the overall direction of the struggle, hinders the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, affects and disrupts production, disrupts the revolutionary order, damages state property, and endangers the safety of the people. We must resolutely stop this wrong trend.

    The armed fighting between mass organizations is by no means a "revolutionary action" or a "heroic deed," but rather a manifestation of cowardice. Engaging in armed fighting among the masses is not the policy of the proletariat. As Comrade Lin Biao has said, armed fighting can only affect the skin and flesh, not the soul.

    At a time when the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country are launching a great criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the emergence of this trend of armed fighting is not accidental.

    The proletarian revolutionary factions must strictly demand of themselves and resolutely defend and implement the Sixteen Points, setting an example in carrying out Chairman Mao's directive to "use ideological struggle, not armed struggle."

    The contradictions between the revolutionary factions and some of the masses who have been misled into joining conservative organizations are contradictions among the people, not antagonistic contradictions. Some of the misled masses have problems with their ideological understanding. The proletarian revolutionary factions must correctly handle their issues, wholeheartedly help them put down their burdens, and with a strong class feeling and a comradely attitude, adopt the policy of unity-criticism-unity to solve their ideological problems. Chairman Mao said: "In resolving contradictions among the people, we should not use curses, nor should we use fists, knives, or guns. We should use the method of persuasion, the method of reasoning, the method of criticism and self-criticism. In short, we should use democratic methods, let the people speak." The proletarian revolutionary factions should learn to do painstaking ideological work, be good at talking heart-to-heart with them, be good at discussing with them, and believe that they will educate themselves and liberate themselves, welcoming them to join the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Toward those who have been misled, we should not discriminate, insult, or retaliate against them. We should not label them as "countercurrents," "counterattacks," or "old conservatives turning over."

    For those who have joined conservative organizations due to a lack of understanding, they should strictly demand of themselves. They should raise their proletarian consciousness, distinguish between friends and enemies, recognize the overall direction of the struggle, and humbly learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions. They should resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the proletarian revolutionary factions, completely break with the capitalist reactionary line, and direct their struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. If they have made mistakes, as long as they recognize and correct them, they are good comrades. They should not be emotional, should not be resentful, and in the face of proletarian truth, there is no question of losing face. Chairman Mao said: "Countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making us, the living, feel sad when we think of them. Can we not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" In the current complex class struggle, if one continues to lose one's way, one may be used by bad elements to engage in armed fighting, which is very dangerous.

    Within the proletarian revolutionary factions and among revolutionary mass organizations, there are differences and disagreements on some issues, and even on certain principled issues. This is a normal phenomenon. As long as both sides truly prioritize the overall situation, focus on the main contradictions, grasp the overall direction of the struggle, fully practice the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, engage in criticism and self-criticism, especially more self-criticism, then these differences and disagreements can be resolved. The parties with differing opinions should seek common ground while reserving differences, and not argue endlessly over minor issues. Even on principled issues, they should present facts and reason, and seek resolution through normal discussion and debate. If some issues cannot be resolved immediately, it should also be allowed for others to retain their opinions. One should not seize on the other's shortcomings, constantly "raise the level," be eager to "fight internal wars," artificially create opposition, and even lead to armed fighting.

    "Use ideological struggle, not armed struggle." This is the proletarian revolutionary policy of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and it is the policy demanded by the hundreds of millions of people across the country. The proletarian revolutionary factions and all revolutionary masses must resolutely defend this policy, resolutely oppose armed fighting, and immediately stop the fighting.

    Recently, our great leader Chairman Mao personally approved the issuance of the "Important Notice" by the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. This "Important Notice" states:

    "1. All revolutionary masses must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's directive to 'grasp revolution, promote production, and promote work,' striving for a double harvest of revolution and production.
    2. Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's directive to use ideological struggle, not armed struggle. Strictly prohibit beating, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting. A few bad elements who incite armed fighting and serious offenders who beat people should be subject to the legal sanctions of the proletarian state.
    The Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army and military representatives have the right to handle armed fighting issues, and relevant parties must listen and not refuse to execute.
    3. Do not damage state property, do not use transportation to participate in armed fighting, and do not mobilize personnel to participate in armed fighting in other units.
    4. Resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's directive to 'resolutely overcome the state of indiscipline or anarchism that exists in many places.' Do not disrupt labor discipline. Do not be absent from work without reason. Resolutely fight against all phenomena that disrupt revolutionary and production order.
    5. The proletarian dictatorship organs should, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary factions and take on the sacred responsibility of maintaining and consolidating the revolutionary order of the proletarian dictatorship, protecting state property, and protecting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
    6. Resolutely carry out the April 20 notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on stopping external connections. Beijing students and masses who have gone out for connections should, except for those specially approved by the Central authorities, immediately return to Beijing in their entirety. Students and masses from other places who have come to Beijing for connections should also immediately return to their respective places in their entirety."

    The "Important Notice" approved by Chairman Mao should be seriously studied and resolutely implemented by workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, and cadres across the country.

    Comrades in the proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary comrades, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been going on for a year, and we have achieved great victories. At this crucial moment of launching a general offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, we must seriously study the notice formulated by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as important articles such as "The Essence of 'Tempering' Is to Betray the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" and "A Great Historical Document." We must carry out rectification, summarize experiences, firmly implement Chairman Mao's policies, improve our struggle tactics, strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, firmly grasp the overall direction of the struggle, and achieve new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 立即制止武斗

    立即制止武斗
    近来，在一些地方、一些单位、一些群众组织之间，出现一股武斗的歪风。它干扰了斗争的大方向，妨碍了无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，影响和破坏生产，破坏革命的秩序，破坏国家财产，危及人民的生命安全。我们必须坚决煞住这股歪风。
    群众组织之间的武斗，决不是什么“革命行动”，决不是什么“英雄行为”，而是懦弱的表现。在群众间进行武斗，决不是无产阶级的政策。正如林彪同志所说，武斗只能触及皮肉，不能触及灵魂。
    当前，正当全国亿万革命群众向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判、大斗争的时候，出现这股武斗歪风，决不是偶然的。
    无产阶级革命派必须严格要求自己，坚决捍卫和贯彻执行十六条，做执行毛主席的指示“要用文斗，不用武斗”的模范。
    革命派和一些受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众之间的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾，而不是敌我矛盾。一些受蒙蔽的群众是属于思想认识问题。无产阶级革命派必须正确地对待他们，满腔热忱地帮助他们放下包袱，带着强烈的阶级感情，抱着同志式的态度，采取团结——批评——团结的方针，去解决他们的思想认识问题。毛主席说：“解决人民内部矛盾，不能用咒骂，也不能用拳头，更不能用刀枪，只能用讨论的方法，说理的方法，批评和自我批评的方法。一句话，只能用民主的方法，让群众讲话的方法。”无产阶级革命派要学会做深入细致的思想工作，要善于同他们谈心，善于同他们商量，相信他们会自己教育自己，自己解放自己，欢迎他们回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。对一些受蒙蔽的同志，不应该歧视，不能侮辱，不能打击报复，不要动不动就把人家说成是“逆流”，“反扑”，“老保翻天”。
    对于一些认识不清而参加保守组织的群众来说，应该严格要求自己。要提高无产阶级觉悟，分清敌我，认清斗争大方向，并且虚心地向无产阶级革命派学习。要坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，站到无产阶级革命派一边，彻底同资产阶级反动路线决裂，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。犯了错误，只要认识到了，改了，就是好同志。不要感情用事，不要不服气，在无产阶级真理面前，没有什么丢面子的问题。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”在当前阶级斗争尖锐复杂的情况下，如果继续迷失方向，那就有可能被坏人利用，跟着别人搞武斗，那是很危险的。
    在无产阶级革命派内部，革命群众组织之间，在一些问题上，甚至在某些原则问题上，有不同意见和分歧，是正常的现象。只要争论的双方都能真正以大局为重，抓住主要矛盾，掌握斗争的大方向，充分发扬无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，展开批评和自我批评，特别是多作自我批评，那么这些意见和分歧就不难解决。持有不同意见的双方，应该求大同存小异，不要在枝节问题上争论不休。就是原则性的问题，也要摆事实，讲道理，通过正常的讨论和辩论求得解决。有些问题一时解决不了，也应当允许别人保留自己的意见。决不要抓住对方这样或那样的缺点不放，拚命地“上纲”，热中于“打内战”，人为地制造对立，甚至导致武斗。
    “要用文斗，不用武斗。”这是毛主席、党中央的无产阶级革命政策，是全国亿万人民所要求的政策。无产阶级革命派和一切革命群众要坚决捍卫这一政策，坚决反对武斗，立即制止武斗。
    最近，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自批准发布了北京市革命委员会《重要通告》。这个《重要通告》指出：
    “一、革命群众都必须坚决执行毛主席、党中央关于‘抓革命、促生产、促工作’的指示，争取革命和生产双丰收。
    二、坚决执行毛主席关于要文斗，不要武斗的指示。严禁打、砸、抢、抄、抓。煽动武斗的少数坏人和情节严重的打人凶手，应该受到无产阶级国家法律的制裁。
    人民解放军北京卫戍部队和军代表有权处理武斗问题，有关方面必须听从，不得拒绝执行。
    三、不准破坏国家财产，不准动用交通工具参加武斗，不准调动人员参加外单位的武斗。
    四、坚决执行毛主席关于‘必须坚决地克服许多地方存在着的某些无纪律状态或无政府状态’的指示。不许破坏劳动纪律。不许无故旷工。坚决同一切扰乱革命和生产秩序的现象作斗争。
    五、无产阶级专政机构应该按照毛主席的教导，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，担负起维护和巩固无产阶级专政的革命秩序、保卫国家财产、保卫无产阶级文化大革命的神圣职责。
    六、坚决执行中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组四月二十日关于停止外出串连的通知。已经外出串连的北京学生和群众，除经中央特许的以外，应当立即全部返回北京，外地来北京串连的学生和群众，同样也应立即全部返回本地。”
    毛主席批准发布的这个《重要通告》，全国各地工、农、兵、学、商和广大干部，都应当认真学习，坚决执行。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，革命的同志们，无产阶级文化大革命已经进行一年了，我们已经取得了很大的胜利。在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的关键时刻，我们一定要认真地学习毛主席主持制定的中共中央的《通知》，以及《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》《伟大的历史文件》等重要文章，开展整风，总结经验，坚定地执行毛主席的政策，提高斗争艺术，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，夺取无产阶级文化大革命新的更大的胜利。
