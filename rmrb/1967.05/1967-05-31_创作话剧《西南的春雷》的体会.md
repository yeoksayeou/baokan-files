In the call to arms of the January Revolution in Shanghai and under the great inspiration of the "Spring Thunder in the Southwest," the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Guizhou Provincial Drama Troupe united and seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. Immediately, we took action, criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and the anti-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and arts on the one hand, and on the other, deeply integrating with workers, peasants, and soldiers to create and perform the ten-act play "Spring Thunder in the Southwest," which praises the glorious struggle of the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province. This play has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Literature and art should become a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, for attacking and annihilating the enemy, and for helping the people fight the enemy heart and soul." The proletarian revolutionary artists of our troupe, after achieving victory in the struggle for power, with deep feelings for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, followed Chairman Mao's teachings and immediately took up this sharp weapon of literature and art to join the battle of the Cultural Revolution. At that time, the struggle for power in Guizhou Province had just been won, but the class enemies were still struggling desperately. Some people with ulterior motives spread malicious rumors everywhere, such as "the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou started late, and the real leftist forces have not yet formed," in an attempt to deny the achievements of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Guizhou during the Cultural Revolution and to attack the proletarian revolutionary faction that had just taken power. We were very indignant about these malicious attacks. Many comrades suggested that we should bring the great struggle of the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou over the past eight months, the heroic image of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and the great achievement of the Cultural Revolution—the birth of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ—onto the stage. We should use the weapon of literature and art to defend the red political power and smash the class enemies' slanderous attacks!

Creating a play that reflects such a major topic as the Cultural Revolution in such a short period of time is quite difficult. Faced with difficulties, should we be bold and forge ahead, or should we be afraid and retreat? We brought this question to the study of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a guiding document for the Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The literature and art of the proletariat are a part of the whole revolutionary cause of the proletariat, just as Lenin said, they are 'gears and screws' in the whole revolutionary machine." Chairman Mao's teachings pointed out the direction for us and strengthened our confidence. We all felt that in the past, a handful of anti-revolutionary revisionists controlled the leadership of the literary and artistic circles, depriving the broad masses of literary and artistic workers of the right to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the proletarian politics, leading us astray to serve the bourgeois politics. Today, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has triumphed, and we proletarian revolutionaries are in charge. We must take up the weapon of literature and art to loudly proclaim the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and to sing the praises of the heroic figures of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the proletarian revolutionary faction, making literature and art truly a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, attacking and annihilating the enemy in the hands of the proletariat!

Under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, we dispelled the fear and replaced it with courage. With the enthusiastic help of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, we overcame various difficulties and firmly created the play "Spring Thunder in the Southwest," which reflects the great struggle of the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou.

Because this play reflects the current real struggle, propagates Mao Zedong Thought, and establishes the heroic images of workers, peasants, soldiers, and revolutionary youngsters who are making waves in the Cultural Revolution, it has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. A railway worker, after watching the performance, excitedly said: "Your performance reflects the glorious struggle of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Guizhou, and it has given me a vivid lesson in class struggle."

Who should complete the creation of major themes that reflect the current real struggle? Should it be a few professional workers who create in isolation from the masses and the real struggle, or should it rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to wage a "people's war"? This is a major issue in the struggle between the two lines in literary creation.

We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable. Not understanding this, one cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge." We realized that to create revolutionary literature and art that praises the current great struggle, we must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and wage a "people's war." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards are the main force and vanguard of this great proletarian Cultural Revolution. They hold the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought highest, have the most revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and have the richest experience in struggle. Only by fully relying on them and fighting together with them can we create truly new revolutionary literature and art of the proletariat!

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, from the beginning of the creation to the final performance of the play "Spring Thunder in the Southwest," we have always adhered to the mass line of "open-door creation" and combining with workers, peasants, and soldiers. In our creation process, the Guizhou Provincial Proletarian Revolutionary Command Headquarters gave us timely guidance, making our direction clear, and specially organized a symposium for us. Representatives of various revolutionary mass organizations analyzed the characteristics of the Cultural Revolution in the Guiyang area with Mao Zedong Thought at the symposium. They not only provided us with very precious creative materials with their own struggle experiences and rich insights but also put forward specific and vivid suggestions on how to praise the heroic images of proletarian revolutionary fighters. After the initial draft of the script was written, we organized the creative and performing personnel to go to the Guizhou Diesel Engine Factory, participate in labor, read the initial draft, and solicit the opinions of revolutionary workers. The first act, which reflects the revolutionary struggle of "June 8," was just rehearsed, and we went to the Guiyang Normal College to "open the door" for rehearsal, letting the revolutionary youngsters review and comment. The revolutionary youngsters put forward very sincere suggestions on characters, language, and plots, and actively sent a few youngsters who had personally participated in the struggles of "June 8" and "September 5" to help us revise the script. In the process of creating the script, dozens of factories, mines, institutions, and schools of revolutionary mass organizations introduced the situation of the Cultural Revolution struggle to us and provided us with materials and clues. Because the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary youngsters participated in the creation and revision, this play was revised more than ten times in just over a month and was quickly staged for the broad audience.

In the rehearsal and performance, we also followed the path of combining literary and artistic workers with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The play "Spring Thunder in the Southwest" included some revolutionary pioneers from outside the troupe. Workers and revolutionary youngsters have rich experiences in struggle. They can vividly portray their own participation in the struggle and the heroic figures they are familiar with, making up for our lack of familiarity with the struggle life.

Through the creation and performance of "Spring Thunder in the Southwest," we have a deeper understanding that the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are not only the protagonists on the political stage but also the protagonists on the artistic stage. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers can only create truly proletarian new literature and art by deeply integrating with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and fully relying on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary youngsters!

Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out in 1964 at the symposium on the modern opera performance of Peking Opera: "The key to creation is to combine the leadership, professionals, and the masses." This "three-in-one combination" in creation is the specific application of Chairman Mao's mass line in literary creation. Comrades deeply feel that in the past, the capitalist-roaders within the Party in the literary and artistic circles deliberately distorted the "three-in-one combination" policy. The "leadership" they talked about was the bourgeois lord who implemented the anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line; the "experts" and "authorities" they relied on were those who served them; and the masses in their eyes were just "fools"! We must thoroughly smash this anti-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line and follow the truly revolutionary "three-in-one combination" path in creation. This revolutionary "three-in-one combination" path is the path of combining the revolutionary leadership under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary literary and artistic workers who love Mao Zedong's literary and artistic line, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary youngsters who have created immortal achievements in the Cultural Revolution. Only the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" can create proletarian revolutionary literature and art that are worthy of our great era under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, quickly, efficiently, and economically!

    创作话剧《西南的春雷》的体会
    贵州省话剧团“九·五”革命造反团
    在上海“一月革命”的进军号声中，在“西南的春雷”的巨大鼓舞下，我们贵州省话剧团的无产阶级革命派在联合起来，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权以后，立即行动起来，一面批判资产阶级反动路线和反革命修正主义文艺路线；一面深入工农兵，和工农兵结合，创作和演出了歌颂贵州省无产阶级文化大革命的光荣斗争历程的十场话剧《西南的春雷》。这个话剧受到了广大无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的欢迎。
    毛主席教导我们：“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”我团无产阶级革命派文艺战士，在取得夺权斗争的胜利以后，怀着对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的深厚的感情，遵循毛主席的教导，立即拿起文艺这个锐利武器，投入无产阶级文化大革命的战斗。当时，贵州省的夺权斗争刚刚取得胜利，阶级敌人还在垂死挣扎，一些别有用心的人到处散布什么“贵州文化大革命开展得迟，真正的左派队伍还没有形成”等等无耻谰言，妄图否定贵州省无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中的业绩，攻击刚刚掌权的无产阶级革命派。我们对这些别有用心的攻击十分气愤，许多同志提出建议，把八个月来的贵州无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争历程，把无产阶级革命派的英雄形象，把文化大革命的伟大成果——革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构的诞生，搬上舞台，用文艺这个战斗武器保卫红色政权，粉碎阶级敌人的造谣攻击！
    在短时期内，要创作出反映文化革命这样重大题材的话剧，困难是相当大的。在困难面前，是“敢”字当头，勇往直前，还是“怕”字当头，见难而退？我们带着这个问题，反复学习了毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这部文化大革命的纲领性文件。毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分，如同列宁所说，是整个革命机器中的‘齿轮和螺丝钉’。”毛主席的教导给我们指明了方向，增强了信心，大家认为：过去，一小撮反革命修正主义分子把持文艺界的领导权，剥夺了广大文艺工作者为工农兵、为无产阶级政治服务的权利，把我们引向为资产阶级政治服务的邪路。今天，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利了，我们无产阶级革命派当家了，我们就是要拿起文艺武器，为毛泽东思想的伟大胜利大喊大叫，为广大工农兵和无产阶级革命派的英雄人物大唱特唱，使文艺真正成为无产阶级手中团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器！
    在毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，我们打消了“怕”字，换上了“敢”字，在广大工农兵的热情帮助下，我们克服了种种困难，坚定不移地创作出反映贵州文化革命伟大斗争的话剧《西南的春雷》。
    由于这个剧反映了当前的现实斗争，宣传了毛泽东思想，树立了文化大革命中叱咤风云的工农兵和革命小将的英雄形象，受到广大工农兵群众的欢迎。一个铁路工人看了戏后，激动地说：“你们的演出反映了贵州无产阶级革命派的光荣斗争，给我上了一堂生动的阶级斗争课。”
    创作反映当前现实斗争的重大题材，靠谁去完成呢？是靠几个专业工作者脱离群众、脱离现实斗争“闭门造车”，还是依靠广大工农兵群众，打一场“人民战争”？这是文艺创作上两条路线斗争的重大问题。
    我们反复地学习了毛主席关于群众路线的教导：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”我们认识到，要创作歌颂当前伟大斗争的革命文艺，必须相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，打一场“人民战争”。广大工农兵群众、红卫兵小将是这场伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的主力军和急先锋。毛泽东思想伟大红旗他们举得最高，革命造反精神他们最足，斗争经验他们最丰富，只有充分依靠他们，和他们共同战斗，才能创作出真正的无产阶级的崭新的革命文艺！
    遵循毛主席的教导，《西南的春雷》这个话剧，从开始创作到最后演出，我们始终贯彻了一条“开门创作”，和工农兵相结合的群众路线。在我们的创作过程中，贵州省无产阶级革命派总指挥部给了我们及时的指导，使我们明确了方向，并为我们专门组织了座谈会。各革命群众组织的代表，在会上用毛泽东思想分析了贵阳地区无产阶级文化大革命的斗争特点，他们不仅以自身的斗争经历和丰富的体会提供了十分宝贵的创作素材，而且对如何歌颂无产阶级革命派战士的英雄形象，提出了具体而生动的建议。剧本的初稿写出来以后，我们及时组织创作、演出人员到贵州柴油机厂，一边参加劳动，一边朗读初稿，征求革命派工人的意见。反映“六·八”革命斗争的第一幕戏刚排出来，我们就到贵阳师范学院“开门”排演，让革命小将审查、提意见。革命小将在人物、语言、情节各方面都提出了极其中肯的建议，还主动派了几个亲身参加“六·八”“九·五”斗争的小将，和我们一起修改剧本。在剧本的创作过程中，先后有几十个厂矿、机关、学校的革命群众组织，向我们介绍了文化大革命的斗争情况，为我们提供素材、线索。由于广大工农兵、革命小将参与了创作、修改，从而使这个剧在短短的一个多月中，进行了十余次的反复修改，终于很快地搬上了舞台和广大观众见面。
    在排练和演出中，我们也同样走文艺工作者和工农兵结合的道路。《西南的春雷》一剧，就有剧团外的一些革命闯将参加演出。工人同志和革命小将在斗争中有着丰富的体会，他们表现自己亲身参加的斗争生活，表现自己所熟悉的英雄人物，得心应手，弥补了我们革命文艺战士对斗争生活不熟悉的缺陷。
    通过《西南的春雷》的创作、演出，使我们更深刻地领会到工农兵群众不但是政治舞台上的主人公，也是艺术舞台上的主人公，革命的文艺战士只有深入到工农兵群众中去，充分依靠广大工农兵和革命小将，才能创作出真正的无产阶级的新文艺！江青同志一九六四年七月在京剧现代戏观摩演出人员座谈会上对创作问题曾指示说：“抓创作的关键是把领导、专业人员、群众三者结合起来”。这个创作上三结合的道路，正是毛主席的革命群众路线在文艺创作上的具体运用。同志们深有体会地说：过去文艺界党内走资本主义道路当权派，别有用心地歪曲“三结合”方针，他们说的“领导”，是贯彻反革命修正主义文艺黑线的资产阶级老爷；他们所依靠的，是为他们效劳的资产阶级“专家”、“权威”；而群众在他们眼里只是“阿斗”！我们一定要彻底摧毁这条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，在创作上走真正革命的“三结合”的道路。这条革命的“三结合”道路，就是：毛泽东思想统帅一切的革命的领导和广大的无限热爱毛主席文艺路线的革命文艺战士以及在无产阶级文化大革命中创建了不朽功勋的广大工农兵和革命小将三者结合的道路，只有革命的“三结合”，才能在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，多快好省地创作出无愧于我们伟大时代的无产阶级的革命文艺！
