The U.S. imperialists, after instigating their tool of aggression, Israel, to issue threats of aggression against Syria, are now colluding closely with the Soviet revisionist leadership, preparing to openly interfere in the Middle East situation, attempting to extinguish the flames of anti-American anger among the Arab people.

On May 23, U.S. imperialist leader Johnson issued a statement on the Middle East situation. In his statement, he employed his usual two-faced counter-revolutionary tactics, on the one hand, reiterating the old tune of "peace" and "stability" in the Middle East, attempting to deceive the world's people and cover up the truth of U.S. subversive and destructive activities in the region; on the other hand, he loudly proclaimed that the Middle East is of great importance to the United States, and revealed a ferocious demeanor, threatening and intimidating the Arab countries. Johnson, in his statement, openly disregarded the sovereignty of the United Arab Republic (UAR), unreasonably opposing the UAR government's decision to demand the withdrawal of "UN Emergency Forces" from UAR territory and the Gaza region, claiming that "the UN staying in this region is a fundamentally important issue, and we will fully support its continued stay there." Johnson viciously attacked the UAR's announcement of a blockade on Israeli ships in the Gulf of Aqaba in response to Israel's threats of aggression, and openly supported Israel, shouting that the blockade was "illegal" and "could lead to disaster." Johnson made no attempt to hide his intention to use the UN, which is manipulated by the U.S., to interfere in the Middle East situation, urging UN Secretary-General U Thant to "give the highest priority to the Middle East situation."

Meanwhile, under the instructions of U.S. imperialism, UN Secretary-General U Thant is actively engaged in activities. He rushed to Cairo on May 23, attempting to exert pressure on the UAR. To support U Thant's activities, U.S. Ambassador to the UN Goldberg declared: "The Security Council should express resolute support for U Thant and call on all member states to fully cooperate," attempting to collude with the Soviet revisionist leadership to involve other countries in the dirty business of extinguishing the anti-American flames in the Middle East.

It is worth noting that U.S. imperialism is also engaged in intense backstage dealings with the Soviet revisionist leadership, plotting to jointly extinguish the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people. According to a report published by the British "Sunday Times" on May 21, Johnson had sent an "urgent and secret appeal" to Soviet leader Kosygin, suggesting that the Soviet Union and the United States take "joint diplomatic action" on the Middle East issue. Agence France-Presse also revealed on May 22 that "the U.S. government has requested the Soviet Union to use its influence through its ambassador in Moscow" to "prevent the outbreak of hostile actions."

According to a report from Reuters on May 21 from Washington, U.S. State Department officials confirmed that "the Soviet Union has assured the United States that it has a definite interest in maintaining peace in the Middle East and preventing an Arab-Israeli war." The aforementioned assurance was repeatedly mentioned during the U.S.'s contacts with Moscow, London, and Paris regarding the tense situation in the Middle East.

After intense backstage activities, the Soviet government, on the same day Johnson issued his statement, also issued a statement on the Near East situation, making no condemnation of the U.S. imperialists, the culprits behind the Middle East tensions, but singing the same tune as Johnson, talking about "peace," "security," and the "worrying" situation in the Near East, etc. The Soviet revisionist leadership, which has always sabotaged the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, even expressed that the Soviet Union "will do everything possible" to interfere in the Middle East situation, aiming to sabotage the anti-American struggle of the Arab people.

Britain, in order to protect its colonial interests in the Middle East, is also actively participating in the conspiracies of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. British Foreign Secretary Brown rushed to Moscow on May 23. According to Western news agencies, Brown will discuss the Middle East situation with Soviet leaders in Moscow and will request the Soviet revisionist leadership to "use their influence" to interfere in the Middle East situation.

While intensifying diplomatic activities in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, the U.S. is also strengthening its military deployments in the eastern Mediterranean, attempting to exert military pressure on the Arab countries. According to reports, ships from the U.S. Sixth Fleet have already reached the coasts of the UAR and the Gaza Strip, with more ships on their way to the eastern Mediterranean. The British military spokesman in Malta also announced on the evening of May 23 that British warships and troops in the Mediterranean are on alert.

    美苏加紧勾结干预中东局势
    约翰逊公然支持以色列　苏修保证同美帝联合行动
    据新华社二十四日讯  美帝国主义在唆使它的侵略工具以色列向叙利亚发出侵略威胁后，目前正同苏修领导集团加紧勾结，准备公开干预中东局势，企图扑灭阿拉伯人民的反美怒火。
    美帝国主义头子约翰逊二十三日就中东局势发表一项声明。他在声明中施展了他惯用的反革命两手的伎俩，一方面重弹所谓中东的“和平”和“稳定”的滥调，企图欺骗世界人民，掩盖美帝在中东地区进行颠覆破坏活动的真相；同时，大肆叫嚷中东地区对美国“具有重大的利害关系”，并且露出一副凶相，对阿拉伯国家进行恐吓威胁。约翰逊在声明中公开无视阿联的主权，无理反对阿联政府提出要求“联合国紧急部队”撤出阿联领土和加沙地区的决定，说什么“联合国呆在这个地区是一个有根本重要性的问题，并将全力支持它继续呆在那里”。约翰逊对阿联为了对付以色列侵略威胁而宣布不准以色列船只出入亚喀巴湾一事进行恶毒攻击，并公开支持以色列，叫嚷封锁亚喀巴湾是“非法的”、“可能带来灾难”。约翰逊毫不掩饰地表示要利用由美帝一手操纵的联合国来插手干预中东局势，要联合国秘书长吴丹对中东局势“给予最优先的考虑”。
    与此同时，联合国秘书长吴丹在美帝国主义的授意下正在加紧活动。他已经在二十三日赶到开罗，企图对阿联施加压力。为了配合吴丹的活动，美国驻联合国大使戈德堡叫嚷说：“安理会应当表示坚决支持吴丹，号召全体会员国充分给予合作”，企图以此伙同苏联修正主义领导集团，挟持其他国家参与扑灭中东的反美烈火的肮脏勾当。
    值得注意的是：美帝国主义还正在同苏联修正主义领导集团进行一场紧张的幕后交易活动，阴谋合伙扑灭阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争。据英国《星期日泰晤士报》二十一日刊登这家报纸记者从华盛顿发回的一则消息透露，约翰逊已经向苏修头目柯西金发出一个“紧急的、秘密的呼吁”，建议苏联同美国在中东问题上“采取联合外交行动”。法新社二十二日也透露，“美国政府已经通过它驻莫斯科大使要求苏联运用它的影响”，以
  “防止敌对行动爆发”。
    据路透社二十一日从华盛顿发出一则消息透露，美国国务院官员证实，“苏联已向美国保证，它在维持中东和平和防止阿拉伯—以色列战争方面有肯定的利害关系。上述保证在美国同莫斯科、伦敦和巴黎就中东紧张局势进行接触的过程中，曾多次提出过。”
    在进行了紧张的幕后活动以后，苏联政府在约翰逊发表声明的同一天，也就近东局势发表了一项声明，对制造中东紧张局势的罪魁祸首美帝国主义只字不加谴责，却同约翰逊唱一个调子，大谈什么“和平”、“安全”和近东局势“令人不安”等等。一贯破坏世界人民革命斗争的苏修领导集团甚至也表示，苏联“将尽一切可能”，插手中东局势，以破坏阿拉伯人民的反美斗争。
    英国为了维护它在中东的殖民利益，也积极参与美苏的阴谋活动。英国外交大臣布朗在二十三日赶到莫斯科。据西方通讯社透露，布朗将在莫斯科同苏修领导人会谈中东局势，并将要求苏修领导集团“利用他们的影响”，对中东局势进行干预。
    美帝在与苏修加紧勾结进行频繁的外交活动的同时，还大力加强它在东地中海的军事部署，企图对阿拉伯国家施加军事压力。据报道，美国第六舰队的舰只已经开到阿联和加沙地带的海岸附近，另有大批舰只正在开往东地中海途中。在马耳他的英国军事发言人也在二十三日晚间宣布，在地中海的英国军舰和军队已经处于警戒状态。
