Title: Intensifying Economic Infiltration to Promote the Complete Transformation of the Soviet Union

The American ruling class has recently issued a large number of statements. While praising the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries, they are vigorously encouraging the Soviet revisionist traitors and their followers to completely throw themselves into the embrace of American imperialism.

Recently, various leaders of the American ruling class, following the tune set by President Johnson, have frequently advocated for a "bridging" policy towards the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. They want to make the relationship between the United States and these countries "go beyond peaceful coexistence" and enter a "new era" of "peaceful interaction." They particularly emphasize expanding economic relations and cultural exchanges to strengthen "cooperation" and build a "bridge of trust."

The American ruling class does not hide the fact that implementing this "bridging" policy fully serves American interests. Johnson has publicly stated that expanding trade with the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries is beneficial to America's "broad political purposes" and "economic interests." Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State George Ball recently admitted that doing so, "we have nothing to lose and can gain some tangible benefits."

What does American imperialism want to gain and achieve? Ball bluntly said that expanding trade "helps to create conditions for the Russian people and the people of Eastern Europe to return to the single family of all nations, to join the general trend of the West, and to break away from the dangerous and misguided Eastern despotism." He strongly supports the plan by the U.S. Export-Import Bank to provide loans to an Italian car company to build a car factory in the Soviet Union, arguing that: "A car is an ideology with four wheels," and with such things, "the Russians will no longer be the same." Former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Foy D. Kohler also advocates that trade can have "positive results" in encouraging "constructive changes" in these countries, because "trade is not only commercial, but also political."

American imperialism, in order to realize its ambition to dominate all of Europe, openly advocates using East-West "cooperation" to incorporate the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries into capitalist Western Europe. Johnson recently claimed that through "technical cooperation, improving economic relations, and cultural exchanges," progress can be made in "accelerating the reconciliation of political and economic divisions in Europe."

The series of frenzied outcries by American imperialists serve as an excellent negative example for the people of the world. These statements not only expose the American imperialists' greedy ambition to swallow the whole world but also further expose the shameful face of the Soviet revisionists who are willing to be the number one henchman of American imperialism, fully betraying the interests of the Soviet, Eastern European, and global peoples.

### 大搞经济渗透　促使苏联彻底演变  美帝鼓励苏修完全投入它的怀抱

    大搞经济渗透　促使苏联彻底演变
    美帝鼓励苏修完全投入它的怀抱
    据新华社讯　美国统治集团最近发表大量言论，在赞赏苏联和东欧一些国家的“和平演变”的同时，大肆鼓励苏修叛徒及其追随者进一步完全投入美帝怀抱。
    最近期间，美国统治集团大大小小的头目们，按照总统约翰逊定下的调子，频繁地鼓吹要对苏联和东欧一些国家实行“搭桥”政策，要使美国同它们的关系“超过和平共处”而进入“和平交往”的“新时代”。他们特别强调通过扩大经济关系和文化交流来加强“合作”，建立“信任之桥”。
    美国统治集团毫不掩饰地承认，实行这种“搭桥”政策完全符合美国的利益。约翰逊曾经公开声称，美国同苏联和东欧一些国家扩大贸易有利于美国的“广泛的政治目的”和“经济利益”。美国前副国务卿鲍尔最近表白说，这样做，“我们没有什么可损失的，却可以得到一些实实在在的东西”。
    美帝国主义要得到什么东西，达到什么目的呢？鲍尔露骨地说，扩大贸易“有助于创造条件，使俄国人和东欧人民回到单一的各国人民的家庭里，归向西方的总潮流，脱离危险的和不对头的东方专制统治”。他极力支持美国进出口银行为意大利一家汽车公司在苏联修建一个汽车厂提供贷款的计划，理由是：“汽车是四个轮子的意识形态”，靠着这种东西，“俄国人就再也不会是老样子了”。美国前驻苏大使、副国务卿帮办科勒也鼓吹说，贸易可以在鼓励这些国家的“建设性变化”方面产生“积极的结果”，因为“贸易不光是商业的，也是政治的”。
    美帝国主义为了实现其囊括全欧的野心，还露骨地宣扬通过东西欧“合作”来把苏联和东欧一些国家并入资本主义西欧。约翰逊最近声称，要“通过技术合作，改善经济关系和文化交流”，来“加速弥合欧洲政治和经济分裂方面的进展”。
    美帝国主义者的这一系列疯狂的叫嚣对全世界人民说来，是极好的反面教材。这些言论既暴露了美帝妄图鲸吞全球的狼子野心，也进一步揭穿了苏修甘当美帝头号帮凶，全面出卖苏联、东欧人民和全世界人民利益的可耻的叛徒嘴脸。
