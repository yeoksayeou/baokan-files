The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned the British authorities in Hong Kong for their brutal suppression of Chinese workers and fully supports the Chinese government's stern position. The Asian-African Journalists' Association and a Cambodian newspaper have also condemned the British authorities' fascist atrocities.

Hanoi, May 17 (Xinhua) - The Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Foreign Ministry issued a statement on May 17 strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for their brutal suppression of Chinese workers. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Recently, the owner of a Hong Kong artificial flower factory unreasonably closed one of its branches and laid off a large number of workers.

To defend their legitimate rights, Chinese workers in Hong Kong held marches and demonstrations to protest against the factory owner's brutal actions.

The British authorities in Hong Kong deployed more than a thousand armed police, brutally suppressing the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong. They arrested over four hundred people, injured about one hundred, and a young man was brutally killed. The aforementioned fascist actions trampled on the interests of Chinese residents in Hong Kong and were a blatant provocation against the entire Chinese people. This action reflects the British government's collusion with the United States against the Chinese people and is related to its allowing the United States to use Hong Kong as a base for its aggression in the Vietnam War.

The Vietnamese Democratic Republic government fully supports the stern position of the Chinese government as stated in the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on May 15, 1967.

The Vietnamese Democratic Republic government firmly demands that the British government immediately stop suppressing Chinese workers and people in Hong Kong; immediately release the arrested individuals, apologize to them, and compensate for all their losses; severely punish the instigators; and take effective measures to guarantee the legitimate rights of workers and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

May 18 (Xinhua) - The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association issued a statement today, strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for their bloody suppression and savage persecution of Chinese workers, residents, and journalists. The statement also firmly supports the just struggle of Chinese workers, residents, and journalists in Hong Kong.

The statement said that the British authorities in Hong Kong carried out this large-scale bloody atrocity after long-term preparation. It is part of the British government's conspiracy with U.S. imperialism against China. The British government, in defiance of the will of the Asian-African peoples and the people of the world, actively collaborated with the U.S. in escalating the war in Vietnam, using Hong Kong's military facilities to serve U.S. aggression policies, and turning Hong Kong into a U.S. war base in the Far East. At the same time, the British authorities in Hong Kong are terrified of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that is shaking the world, and they vainly attempt to suppress its influence with violence. The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and the fighting, revolutionary journalists of Asia and Africa fully support the just demands of the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong. The British authorities in Hong Kong must stop their fascist atrocities; release the arrested individuals; punish the criminals; and ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.

The statement expressed that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association pays tribute to the Chinese journalists in Hong Kong who are on the front lines of this struggle. It is deeply believed that the Chinese workers, residents, and journalists in Hong Kong, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and with the strong support of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the world, will definitely overcome all difficulties and achieve final victory.

Phnom Penh, May 19 (Xinhua) - The Cambodian newspaper "New Telecommunications" published a commentary on May 19, condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for their bloody atrocities against Chinese workers and residents in Hong Kong.

The commentary said, "The Hong Kong incident clearly shows that U.S. imperialism and its accomplices and allies have turned their guns on the people of China. Why is this? Because China prevents them from doing as they please."

The commentary concluded by pointing out that people around the world support the Chinese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism, British colonialism, and their various lackeys. "The 'Hong Kong incident' has aroused the indignation of the world. If the British colonialists, those hiding behind them, and those who want to follow their example, attempt to use suppression to consolidate their position in Hong Kong, they will be greatly mistaken."

    新华社河内十七日电  越南民主共和国外交部十七日发表声明，强烈谴责香港英国当局野蛮镇压中国工人。声明全文如下：
    最近，香港人造花工厂厂主无理关闭该厂的一个分厂，解雇大批工人。
    为了保卫自己的正当权利，香港的中国工人举行游行示威，反对厂主的这一残暴行动。
    香港英国当局出动一千多名武装军警，野蛮镇压香港的中国工人和居民，逮捕四百多人，使大约一百人受伤，一名青年惨遭杀害。上述法西斯行动践踏了香港中国居民的利益，是对全中国人民的蛮横挑衅。这一行动反映了英国政府勾结美国反对中国人民的政策，并且同它允许美国把香港作为侵略越南战争服务的基地有关。
    越南民主共和国政府完全支持中华人民共和国外交部一九六七年五月十五日声明中阐明的中国政府的严正立场。
    越南民主共和国政府坚决要求英国政府必须立即停止镇压香港的中国工人和人民；立即释放被捕人员，向他们道歉并赔偿他们的一切损失；严惩肇事祸首；采取有效措施，保障工人的正当权利，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    新华社十八日讯　亚非记协书记处今天发表声明，最强烈地谴责香港英国当局对香港的中国工人、居民和新闻工作者进行血腥镇压和疯狂迫害的法西斯暴行，并坚决支持香港中国工人、居民和新闻工作者的正义斗争。
    声明说，香港英国当局制造这次大规模的血腥暴行，是经过长期准备的，是英国政府勾结美帝国主义反对中国阴谋的一部分。英国政府违反亚非人民和世界人民的意志，积极配合美帝在越南的战争升级，利用香港的军事设施为美帝的侵略政策服务，把香港变成了美国在远东的战争基地。同时，香港英国当局对战无不胜的毛泽东思想和震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，妄想用暴力来遏制它的影响。亚非记协书记处和亚非战斗的、革命的新闻工作者，完全支持香港中国工人和居民的严正要求。香港英国当局必须停止法西斯暴行；释放被捕人员；惩办凶手；并保证不再发生类似事件。
    声明表示，亚非记协书记处向站在这一斗争前线的香港中国新闻工作者致敬。并深信用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港中国工人、居民、新闻工作者，有亚非拉和全世界革命人民作为强大后盾，一定能排除万难，取得最后胜利。
    据新华社金边十九日电　柬埔寨《新电讯报》十九日发表评论，谴责香港英国当局对香港中国工人和居民犯下的血腥暴行。
    评论说，“香港事件”“清楚地表明了美帝国主义及其帮凶和盟友把矛头转向了人民中国。为什么这样呢？因为中国使它们不能为所欲为。”
    评论最后指出，全世界人民“都支持中国人民反对美帝国主义、反对英国殖民主义及其形形色色走狗的正义斗争。”“‘香港事件’激起了全世界的愤怒。如果英国殖民主义者、那些躲在他们身后的人以及那些想照他们的样子干的人，企图以镇压来巩固他们在香港的地位，他们就大错特错了。”
