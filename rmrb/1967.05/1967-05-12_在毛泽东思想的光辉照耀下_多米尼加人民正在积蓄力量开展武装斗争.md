Two years ago on May 12, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, issued a statement "In Support of the Dominican People's Resistance Against U.S. Armed Aggression." Chairman Mao's statement is the greatest concern and support for the revolutionary struggle of the Dominican and all Latin American peoples, and is the guiding light leading the revolutionary struggle of the Dominican and Latin American peoples to victory. Over the past two years, under the great inspiration of the statement and the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Dominican people have seriously summed up their struggle experience, continuously accumulated revolutionary strength, and deepened the struggle to overthrow U.S. imperialism and the dictatorial rule.

In the practice of revolutionary struggle, the Dominican people have come to recognize that Mao Zedong Thought is the great truth guiding their revolution to victory. More and more revolutionaries are striving to study Chairman Mao's works and gradually beginning to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the Dominican revolution.

	Beginning to Establish Rural Base Areas

After the anti-American patriotic armed struggle launched by the Dominican people two years ago temporarily suffered a setback, U.S. imperialism has been trying every means to force the Dominican people to surrender their weapons and give up the struggle. However, the Dominican revolutionaries have not laid down their arms. They have seriously summed up the experience of the struggle. From their own experience, they have begun to recognize the great guiding significance of Chairman Mao's theory of "establishing rural base areas and encircling the cities from the countryside." The Dominican "People's Movement" pointed out in an important document: The countryside is the "weakest link" of imperialism and the oligarchy, and it is necessary to establish guerrilla units in the mountainous areas and gradually develop them into powerful armed forces of workers and peasants to create conditions to "encircle the cities from the countryside and rely on the countryside to attack the big cities." A regional committee of the Dominican "June 14 Revolutionary Movement" recently pointed out in a letter to the people: The reason the April uprising did not succeed was because "the majority of the population, the peasants, did not participate" and "the revolution was carried out in the cities, where the enemy can effectively mobilize its forces."

	On the basis of the above understanding, the Dominican revolutionary organizations "People's Movement" and "June 14 Revolutionary Movement" have sent their outstanding cadres to the countryside. They carried weapons into the mountainous areas where "tanks cannot enter and planes cannot operate," conducted political mobilization and organizational work among the peasants, and began to establish bases for armed revolution. They also used Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war to educate the masses. In the Dominican revolutionary organizations, more and more people have come to realize that the focus of work should be shifted from the cities to the countryside. The "People's Movement" resolutely criticized the erroneous idea of some people in the organization who did not want to go to the countryside for long-term arduous struggle.

	Call to Form a United Front

The Dominican "People's Movement" and "June 14 Revolutionary Movement" call on people of all strata to form a broad national democratic united front in the anti-American struggle and point out that the united front should be led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. The "People's Movement" organ, the "Liberty Newspaper," pointed out in an article "On the Worker-Peasant Alliance": The weakness exposed by the "Constitutionalist Front" in the April Revolution was precisely because it did not have a strong base of workers and peasants, and without the peasant base, the democratic revolution cannot be carried through to the end.

The Dominican national bourgeoisie participated in the April Revolution two years ago, but later, under the military pressure and political deception of U.S. imperialism, they betrayed the revolution and joined the Balaguer government, fully exposing the inherent weakness of this class. However, the policies of the Balaguer regime, which are pro-American and sell out national interests, have harmed the interests of the national bourgeoisie, and the most radical part of the national bourgeoisie is increasingly dissatisfied with the government. Under these circumstances, the left wing of the national bourgeoisie has re-joined the ranks of the anti-American struggle, and the Dominican revolutionary parties have established some contact with them. The "People's Movement" organ, the "Liberty Newspaper," pointed out: "When the bourgeoisie is preparing to oppose U.S. imperialism and its local lackeys, we unite with it," but in such a union "we must have a very firm principle."

	A Revolutionary Party Must Be Established

Chairman Mao said: "If you want a revolution, you must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a revolutionary party established according to Marxism-Leninism revolutionary theory and style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." With the development of the revolutionary struggle, at present, establishing a Marxist-Leninist party has become the central task of the Dominican revolutionaries. Many revolutionaries especially value the study of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed that their "greatest wish is to apply Chairman Mao's teachings to the practical struggle of the Dominican revolution." They praised Mao Zedong Thought as "the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism" and "the most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, the modern revisionists." They also further saw through the traitorous face of Soviet revisionism, which acted as an accomplice to U.S. imperialism in suppressing the Dominican people, and realized that they must wage a resolute struggle against the Soviet revisionists and the Dominican revisionists.

The facts of the past two years show that the Dominican people are advancing under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Although the revolutionary struggle of the Dominican people will still encounter twists and turns, as Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: "As long as they rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in a protracted struggle, the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Dominican people, with the support of the people of the whole world, will certainly achieve final victory."

### 在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下  多米尼加人民正在积蓄力量开展武装斗争

    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下
    多米尼加人民正在积蓄力量开展武装斗争
    据新华社十一日讯  本社记者述评：两年前的五月十二日，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的声明》。毛主席的声明是对多米尼加和整个拉丁美洲人民革命斗争的最大关怀和支持，是引导多米尼加人民和拉丁美洲各国人民革命斗争走向胜利的指路明灯。两年来，多米尼加人民在声明的巨大鼓舞下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，认真总结斗争经验，不断积蓄革命力量，使推翻美帝国主义和独裁统治的斗争有了更加深入的发展。
    多米尼加人民在革命斗争的实践中，认识到毛泽东思想是指导他们革命走向胜利的伟大真理，越来越多的革命者正在努力学习毛主席著作，逐步开始用毛泽东思想来指导多米尼加的革命斗争。
    开始建立农村根据地
    多米尼加人民两年前掀起的反美爱国武装斗争暂时遭到挫败之后，美帝国主义千方百计地迫使多米尼加人民交出武器，放弃斗争，但是多米尼加革命者并没有放下武器。他们认真地总结斗争的经验。他们从切身的经验中开始认识到毛主席关于“建立农村根据地、以农村包围城市”的理论的伟大指导意义。多米尼加“人民运动”在一项重要文件中指出：农村是“帝国主义和寡头势力统治最薄弱的环节”，必须在山区建立游击小组，并逐渐发展为强大的工农武装，以便创造条件，“从农村包围城市，并依靠农村的力量袭击大城市”。多米尼加“六月十四日革命运动”一个地区委员会最近在告人民书中也指出：四月起义之所以没有成功，就是因为“占人口大多数的农民没有参加”以及“革命在城市进行，而这里正是敌人能有效地调动力量的地方。”
    在上述认识的基础上，多米尼加革命组织“人民运动”和“六月十四日革命运动”把自己的优秀干部派往农村。他们携带武器转入“坦克进不去、飞机起不了作用”的山区，对农民进行政治动员和组织工作，着手建立武装革命的据点，并且用毛主席关于人民战争的思想教育群众。在多米尼加的革命组织中，越来越多的人开始认识到应把工作重心由城市转到农村，“人民运动”坚决批判了自己的组织中某些人不愿去农村进行长期艰苦斗争的错误思想。
    号召结成统一战线
    多米尼加“人民运动”和“六月十四日革命运动”号召各阶层人民在反美斗争中结成一条广泛的民族民主统一战线，并且指出统一战线应以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础。“人民运动”机关报《自由报》在一篇《论工农联盟》的文章中指出：四月革命中“护宪阵线所暴露出来的弱点正是由于它没有一个工人—农民的强大的基础，而没有农民这个基础，民主革命就无法进行到底”。
    多米尼加的民族资产阶级曾经参加了两年前的四月革命，随后在美帝国主义的军事压力和政治诱骗下又背叛了革命，参加了巴拉格政府，充分暴露了这个阶级固有的软弱性。但是巴拉格政权所执行的投靠美国、出卖民族利益的政策损害了民族资产阶级的利益，民族资产阶级中最激进的部分对政府日益不满。在这种情况下，民族资产阶级的左翼重新参加了反美斗争的行列，多米尼加革命政党同他们建立了一定的联系。“人民运动”机关报《自由报》曾经指出：“在资产阶级准备反对美帝国主义及其本地走狗的时候，我们同它联合”，但是在这种联合中“必须具有十分坚定的原则性”。
    必须建立革命的党
    毛主席说：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”随着革命斗争的发展，目前，建立一个马列主义的政党已经成为多米尼加革命者努力的中心。许多革命者特别重视学习毛泽东思想，他们表示“最大的愿望就是把毛主席的教导运用于多米尼加革命的斗争实践”。他们赞扬毛泽东思想是“当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰”，是“反对美帝国主义及其帮凶现代修正主义者的最有效的武器”。他们从切身的经验中也进一步看清了苏联修正主义充当美帝国主义镇压多米尼加人民的帮凶的叛徒嘴脸，认识到必须同苏修和多米尼加的修正主义者进行针锋相对的斗争。
    两年来的事实表明，多米尼加人民正在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下迈步前进。尽管多米尼加人民的革命斗争还会出现反复和曲折，但是，正如毛主席在声明中所指出的：“只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，多米尼加的反美爱国斗争，在全世界人民的支持下，是一定能够取得最后胜利的。”
