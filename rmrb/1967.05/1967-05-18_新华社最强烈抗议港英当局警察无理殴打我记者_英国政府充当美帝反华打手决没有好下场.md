	Xinhua News Agency strongly protests against the Hong Kong British authorities' police brutality against our reporter. The British government's role as the U.S. imperialists' anti-China henchman will not end well.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, May 17th report: Xinhua News Agency sent a telegram to the Hong Kong British authorities today, strongly protesting the Hong Kong British police's unreasonable assault on Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch reporter.

	The telegram from Xinhua News Agency said: "On May 11th, Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch reporter, Si Tuqiang, was conducting legitimate interviews near the artificial flower factory in the New Kowloon area of Kowloon when he was brutally and unreasonably assaulted by the Hong Kong British police. Xinhua News Agency strongly protests this incident to the Hong Kong British authorities.

	"Xinhua News Agency firmly supports the solemn statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and firmly supports the protest made by Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch to the Hong Kong British authorities."

	The telegram pointed out that many facts show that this incident was organized, planned, and premeditated by the Hong Kong British authorities to collaborate with U.S. imperialism's anti-China actions, a crazy fascist bloody atrocity. The telegram said: "This is a new heinous crime committed by the Hong Kong British authorities against the Chinese people."

	The telegram said: "The bloody atrocities created by the Hong Kong British authorities show their extreme fear and hatred of the unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution in China. Because this great proletarian cultural revolution has dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, thoroughly smashed their dream of achieving a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration in China, and greatly inspired and promoted the liberation struggles of oppressed nations around the world.

	"We solemnly warn the Hong Kong British authorities: The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be bullied. The British government dares to be an enemy of the 700 million Chinese people and acts as the U.S. imperialists' anti-China henchman, which will only be like lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet.

	"The entire staff of Xinhua News Agency firmly supports the brave and just struggle of the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and the staff of Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, and will resolutely stand behind them. We solemnly demand that the Hong Kong British authorities: immediately punish the culprits; immediately apologize to the Xinhua News Agency reporter and compensate for all losses; guarantee the freedom of journalists to interview; and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again."

    新华社最强烈抗议港英当局警察无理殴打我记者
    英国政府充当美帝反华打手决没有好下场
    据新华社十七日讯　新华通讯社今天打电报给香港英国当局，就港英警察无理殴打新华社香港分社记者向港英当局提出最强烈的抗议。
    新华通讯社的电报说：“新华社香港分社记者司徒强五月十一日在香港人造花厂九龙新蒲岗分厂附近进行正当的采访活动时，竟被港英警察横蛮无理地殴打，新华通讯社就此对港英当局提出最强烈抗议。
    “新华通讯社坚决拥护中华人民共和国外交部的严正声明，坚决支持新华社香港分社向港英当局提出的抗议。”
    电报指出，许多事实表明，这次事件是香港英国当局为配合美帝国主义反华，有组织、有计划、有预谋地制造的，是一次疯狂的法西斯血腥暴行。电报说：“这是港英当局对中国人民犯下的新的滔天罪行。”
    电报说：“香港英国当局一手制造的血腥暴行，说明他们对于中国无产阶级文化大革命的无限惧怕和仇恨。因为这个史无前例的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，彻底地粉碎了它们企图在中国实现资本主义反革命复辟的梦想，大大地鼓舞和推动了全世界被压迫民族的解放斗争。
    “我们严正警告香港英国当局：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决不是好欺侮的。英国政府胆敢与七亿中国人民为敌，充当美帝国主义的反华打手，这只会是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    “新华通讯社的全体工作人员坚决支持香港中国同胞和新华社香港分社工作人员的英勇、正义的斗争，并且坚决做他们的后盾。我们严正要求香港英国当局：立即严惩凶手；立即向新华社记者道歉，并赔偿一切损失；保证新闻记者的采访自由；保证不再发生类似事件。”
