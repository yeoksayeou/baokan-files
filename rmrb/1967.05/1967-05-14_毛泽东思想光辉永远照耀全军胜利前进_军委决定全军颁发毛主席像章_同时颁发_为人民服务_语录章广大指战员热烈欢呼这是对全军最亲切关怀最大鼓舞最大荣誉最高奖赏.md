The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminates the army's march to victory. The Military Commission decides to issue Mao Chairman badges to the entire army. Simultaneously, "Serve the People" quotation badges are issued. Broad masses of soldiers and officers enthusiastically cheer, calling this the most affectionate care, greatest encouragement, highest honor, and supreme reward for the entire army.

New China News Agency, May 13th: As decided by the Central Military Commission, Mao Chairman badges and "Serve the People" quotation badges specially made by the General Political Department will be distributed to all soldiers and officers of the entire army and to the broad masses of workers starting from mid-May. The General Political Department pointed out that issuing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges is the Central Military Commission's affectionate care and great encouragement for all comrades in the army, and is a major political event of great significance for our army.

The General Political Department pointed out that all comrades in our army have unlimited love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for our great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao. They have long been eager to wear Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges. Wearing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges symbolizes that we are always by the side of Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts, and symbolizes that the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminates our path forward.

The General Political Department requires that at all levels of leadership and among leading cadres, when issuing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges, they must conduct serious education for the troops, explaining the significance. In platoons (basic units), military assemblies should be held, with battalion-level and above leaders giving speeches and conducting education, directly distributing the badges and quotation badges to each comrade. When issuing in offices, appropriate ceremonies should also be held, and serious education conducted.

The General Political Department requires that all comrades in the army, upon wearing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges, must be even more loyal to Chairman Mao, more loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and more loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they must establish new merits. They must better follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and turn our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. They must forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defend socialist revolution and construction, and defend the iron fortress of the proletariat.

New China News Agency, May 13th: The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces are eagerly receiving the specially made Mao Chairman badges and "Serve the People" quotation badges decided by the Central Military Commission and made by the General Political Department.

The Central Military Commission's decision to issue specially made Mao Chairman badges and "Serve the People" quotation badges to the entire army is a major political event of great significance. This heart-stirring piece of good news has made the entire army joyous and ecstatic. At airports, docks, frontline trenches, high-altitude outposts, and vast camps, everywhere is a scene of rejoicing. Inside and outside barracks, new slogans and wall newspapers are posted everywhere. At many platoons and basic units, ceremonies for issuing Mao Chairman badges and quotation badges are held, where broad masses of soldiers and officers, holding red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically shout in thousands of voices: Long live the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years! They wish our reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! They say that issuing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges is the most affectionate care from the great leader Chairman Mao and the Central Military Commission, is the greatest encouragement, highest honor, and supreme reward for us, and is the long-awaited piece of good news.

In the capital, from offices to platoons, from camps to the frontlines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, everywhere is filled with joy. The leadership organs and direct units of the Navy, Air Force, Artillery, Armored Forces, Engineer Forces, and Railway Engineer Forces are holding ceremonies to issue Mao Chairman badges and quotation badges. Many soldiers and officers, upon receiving the Mao Chairman badges and quotation badges, are moved to tears. Some soldiers immediately write down passionate verses: "Mao Chairman badges hang on the chest, soldiers' hearts rise with the red sun. 'Serve the People' shines with golden light, soldiers' hearts are clear, eyes are bright, and will is like steel!" The soldiers of the Beijing Garrison guarding Chairman Mao are wearing Mao Chairman badges and quotation badges, as if they have seen Chairman Mao again and heard the affectionate teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao again. The soldiers of a certain company of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee on duty said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We wear the golden Mao Chairman badges and stand guard in front of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee. Our feet stand firmer, our eyes are brighter, and we are more loyal to Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line."

The soldiers of a certain Red First Company recalled the glorious history of following Chairman Mao in battles. This company was born on Jinggangshan in 1928 and, under Chairman Mao's command, repeatedly defeated the enemy's encirclement and extermination campaigns. During the Long March, they captured Zunyi City and defended the Zunyi Conference. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they participated in the famous Pingxingguan Battle. During the War of Liberation, they participated in the Pingjin Campaign and entered Beijing. These soldiers guarding Chairman Mao said with great emotion that all their achievements are the result of Chairman Mao's affectionate teachings and the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought. The radiance of Mao Zedong Thought will forever illuminate our path forward. They expressed that, upon wearing Mao Chairman badges and "Serve the People" quotation badges, they will definitely better read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. They will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Throughout the country, broad masses of soldiers, wearing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges, unanimously say: The party's favor is greater than the sky and earth; parents are dear, but Chairman Mao is dearer; thousands of songs, ten thousand songs, cannot sing enough of our unlimited love for Chairman Mao; thousands of pens, ten thousand sheets of paper, cannot write enough of our unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. Soldiers in Shanghai, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and other places who have made great contributions to supporting the leftist masses unanimously expressed that they must more resolutely execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, more enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, more firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary faction, more humbly learn from revolutionary masses and young revolutionaries, be modest and prudent, and better complete the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training given by Chairman Mao.

The good news reached the coastal and border defense frontlines. Young sailors, heroic pilots, and vigilant sentinels unanimously shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" Combat hero Shu Jicheng excitedly said, "We soldiers guarding the coastal frontline think of Chairman Mao day and night. Every time the sun rises, we always look towards Beijing, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Today, wearing the golden Mao Chairman badges, we are filled with boundless strength." The young soldiers of a certain island's Air Force "Red Vanguard Radar Station," wearing Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman quotation badges, firmly expressed that they must be a hundred times more vigilant, be ready at any time to smash the enemy's war provocations, defend national defense, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build new merits and new labor for the people.
