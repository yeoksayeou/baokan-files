The sea voyage relies on the helmsman, and all things grow under the sun. With hearts full of joy, we report to our comrades a piece of good news: as decided by the Central Military Commission, the General Political Department has specially made Mao Chairman badges and "Serve the People" slogan badges, which will soon be distributed to every comrade in the army.

The issuance of Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman slogan badges is a warm concern and great encouragement from the Central Military Commission to all comrades in the army. This is a long-awaited joyous event for everyone. We extend our warm congratulations to all comrades in the army! Let us shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live!

Our army is the people's army created by the great leader Chairman Mao, and it has grown and become strong under the nurturing of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Wearing the shining Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman slogan badges, the heroic soldiers guarding the borders of our motherland, the young sailors patrolling the treacherous waves, the brave pilots fighting in the skies of our motherland, and all comrades on the front lines supporting the struggles of the broad masses of leftists, can always see the radiant image of our most beloved leader Chairman Mao, and always think of the affectionate teachings of our most beloved teacher Chairman Mao. With Chairman Mao by our side, we have boundless wisdom and strength. We are not afraid of treacherous shoals and reefs, we dare to brave the knife-edge mountains and seas of fire, and following the revolutionary course set by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, we will march from one victory to another.

Wearing the shining Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman slogan badges, our hearts are like the brightest red sun. Words cannot express our boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. We love Chairman Mao, we are loyal to Chairman Mao, and we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works even better. If we do not study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well, even if we have a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao and the people, we still cannot truly do a good job, and we still cannot complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by Chairman Mao. The better we study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the firmer our proletarian stance will be, the higher our ideological and political level will be, and the greater our revolutionary skills will be.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the best classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. This revolutionary storm sweeps through every corner of social life and deeply touches the soul of every individual. The extremely sharp, extremely complex, and extremely profound class struggle is a class for everyone in our army without attending classes, an exam without taking exams, a class that is a million times more profound, and an exam that is a million times more rigorous. We must combine the study of Chairman Mao's works with the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, adapt to the new situation, new changes, and new needs of the class struggle, and make every effort to truly master Mao Zedong Thought, and use this powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat to push the wheel of history forward.

Wearing the shining Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman slogan badges, we must raise the revolutionary banner of criticism even higher with Mao Zedong Thought, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to deeply expose the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, smash their evil plots to restore capitalism, thoroughly criticize the reactionary line they have formulated and implemented, and thoroughly criticize the big poisonous weed "Cultivation."

Wearing the shining Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman slogan badges, we must more resolutely carry out the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, firmly stand with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, humbly learn from revolutionary masses and revolutionary young people, carry forward the fine tradition of humility and prudence of the people's army, and better complete the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training.

Wearing the shining Mao Chairman badges and Mao Chairman slogan badges, we must better promote revolution, prepare for war, promote work, and promote production. We must raise the Four Good Units movement to a new level. We must heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, be ready at any time to smash the war provocations of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and all reactionaries, defend national defense, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and create new merits for the people.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao's May Day inscription, "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!" best expresses the feelings of the people of the entire country and all comrades in the army. We must follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions to be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is always with us, inspiring us to forge ahead and create a red, red China, and create a red, red world!

    毛主席永远和我们在一起
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳。我们怀着万分喜悦的心情，向同志们报告一个喜讯：经中央军委决定，由总政治部特制的毛主席像章和“为人民服务”语录章，即将陆续发给全军每个同志。
    颁发毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，这是中央军委对全军同志的亲切关怀和巨大鼓舞，是大家久已盼望的大喜事。我们向全军同志表示热烈祝贺！让我们千遍万遍地欢呼：伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    我军是伟大的领袖毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大起来的。戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，守卫在祖国边疆的英雄战士，巡逻在惊涛骇浪里的青年水兵，战斗在祖国天空的飞行勇士，以及在支持左派广大群众斗争前线的全体同志，就可以随时看到我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的光辉形象，随时想到最最敬爱的导师毛主席的亲切教导。毛主席和我们在一起，我们就有无穷的智慧和力量，险滩暗礁我们不怕，刀山火海我们敢闯，沿着我们伟大舵手毛主席指引的革命航向，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。
    戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，我们心中象是升起了最红最红的红太阳。千言万语说不尽我们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限忠诚。我们热爱毛主席，我们忠于毛主席，就要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，就要对毛泽东思想领会得更深，运用得更好。如果对毛泽东思想学得不好，用得不好，即使有着对毛主席、对人民的一片忠心，也还不能真正做好工作，也还不能完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。毛泽东思想学得越好，用得越好，无产阶级立场就越坚定，思想政策水平就越高，干革命的本领就越大。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是活学活用毛泽东思想最好的课堂，这场革命的大风暴，冲击着社会生活的每一个角落，深深地触动着每一个人的灵魂。极其尖锐，极其复杂，极其深刻的阶级斗争，对我军每一个干部战士都是不上课的上课，不考试的考试，比上课深刻一万倍，比考试过硬一万倍。我们要把学习毛主席著作和无产阶级文化大革命的实践结合起来，适应阶级斗争新的形势，新的变化，新的需要，尽最大的努力把毛泽东思想真正学到手，真正掌握起来，运用这一无产阶级强大的思想武器，把历史的巨轮推向前进。
    戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，以毛泽东思想为武器，深入揭发党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，粉碎他们复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，彻底批判他们所制定和推行的资产阶级反动路线，彻底批判大毒草《修养》。
    戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，我们要更坚决地执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，热烈响应毛主席关于拥军爱民的伟大号召，坚定地和无产阶级革命派站在一起，虚心地向革命群众和革命小将学习，发扬人民军队谦虚谨慎的优良作风，更好地完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等光荣任务。
    戴上金光闪闪的毛主席像章和毛主席语录章，我们要更好地抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产。我们要把四好连队运动提高到一个新的水平。我们要百倍地提高警惕，随时准备粉碎美帝、苏修和一切反动派的战争挑衅，保卫国防，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，为人民立新功。
    林彪副统帅“五一”题词：“伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”最好地表达了全国人民和全军同志的心情。我们一定要按照林彪副统帅的指示，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。毛主席永远和我们在一起，鼓舞着我们奋勇前进，去创造一个红彤彤的新中国，去创造一个红彤彤的新世界！
