Heroic South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces recently launched their largest offensive in nearly two years against U.S. aggressors in the area south of the demilitarized zone, achieving a significant victory. In just fourteen days, from April 24 to May 7, they annihilated more than 2,800 enemy troops, including 2,100 U.S. aggressors.

The powerful offensive and glorious victory of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have forcefully struck back at the U.S. imperialists' crimes of escalating the war of aggression in Vietnam, disrupting the entire deployment of the U.S. aggressors on the South Vietnamese battlefield. After suffering this heavy blow, the U.S. imperialist aggressors, from the battlefield to Saigon and Washington, are in a state of panic, shouting "the situation is urgent," once again exposing their paper tiger nature to the people of the world.

Military and Civilian Cooperation to Seize the Initiative

This battle was fought jointly by the military and civilian forces of the two provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien, located near the southern side of the demilitarized zone. Quang Tri and Thua Thien are adjacent to North Vietnam, and the people of these two provinces have a long tradition of anti-imperialist struggle. The U.S. aggressors have always stationed heavy troops in these two provinces. During the "dry season offensive" of 1966-1967, the U.S. military, in an area of only over 9,000 square kilometers in these two provinces, deployed nearly two divisions of U.S. Marines and one division of puppet troops, repeatedly conducting brutal "sweeps" along the two sides of Highway 9 and Highway 1. The aggressors' strategic ambition was to use heavy troops to block the temporary military demarcation line, encircle and annihilate the main force of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army in this region, and prepare conditions for expanding the war of aggression from the ground to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Laos, in order to salvage their extremely difficult situation on the entire South Vietnamese battlefield.

The military and civilian forces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien have carried forward the spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, resolutely striking back at the U.S. aggressors. In the first quarter of this year, they had already annihilated tens of thousands of U.S. and puppet troops, liberating a wide area of over twenty kilometers between Highway 9 to the north and the demilitarized zone to the south. The heroic military and civilian forces of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien Liberation Zone, in coordination with the military and civilian forces of various liberation zones in South Vietnam, have achieved glorious victories. This brilliant victory marks a new progress in the command level and combat technology of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces, and they have firmly seized the initiative on the battlefield.

Concentrate Forces for Quick Decisive Battles

Chairman Mao said, "In tactics and operations, swift decision is a necessary condition for strategic protraction." "Concentrate superior forces, annihilate the enemy in detail."

In the large-scale offensive launched in early April, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region fought a series of brilliant annihilation battles. The brave South Vietnamese Liberation Army struck like lightning and disappeared like the wind, leaving the U.S. and puppet troops disoriented, causing entire battalions and companies to be annihilated. In the battle to attack Long Sinh on April 4, the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces took only a few minutes to annihilate 200 puppet troops. In the night attack on La Vang Town on April 5, the Liberation Armed Forces took only thirty minutes to annihilate and disintegrate more than 750 enemy troops, completely annihilating an enemy infantry battalion, an armored battalion, an artillery company, a security company, and a tank detachment. In the early morning attack on the city of Quang Tri on April 6, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army skillfully employed the tactic of "concentrating superior forces to attack enemy weak points," swiftly entering the city and annihilating more than 300 enemy troops. The U.S. Marine Corps headquarters was only twelve miles away and could not dispatch troops in time to reinforce. The Associated Press, in reporting this battle, had to admit that this was "the best and most devastating tactic."

The Liberation Armed Forces' tactic of using artillery to suddenly attack U.S. aggressor strongholds, bases, and command headquarters also achieved brilliant results. In the artillery strikes on Yu Linh, Dong Ha, Phu Bai, and Kun Tian, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated a large number of enemy troops.

The Power of Guerrilla Warfare is Immense

Chairman Mao said, "In a long and cruel war, guerrilla warfare will display its great power, indeed a matter of no small consequence."

The guerrilla forces of Quang Tri-Thua Thien, with their glorious tradition of struggle, played a great role in this large-scale offensive and established new merits. The guerrillas not only tied down and confused the enemy troops, creating necessary conditions for the activities of the main forces, but also, in the widespread combat activities, killed a large number of enemy troops. Countless elite guerrilla detachments appeared and disappeared without a trace, striking when they wanted to strike and withdrawing when they wanted to withdraw, fighting until the tens of thousands of U.S. aggressors, equipped with airplanes and cannons, were at their wits' end.

In early April, the guerrillas launched a series of attacks on nineteen outposts of the puppet security forces, self-defense forces, and "pacification officials" in Quang Tri and Thua Thien, striking fear into the hearts of the enemy troops. The guerrillas also attacked the Hai Lang and Chau Phong military special zones, destroying five bridges on Highway 1.

The guerrillas' mine warfare also played a significant role. On April 25, the guerrillas in the Khe Sanh area of Quang Tri Province cleverly laid a minefield, causing a U.S. company to suffer more than twenty casualties as soon as they set out. Western newspapers admitted that in some U.S. military units south of the demilitarized zone, 90% of the casualties were caused by mines, and in 1966 alone, the guerrillas' mines killed more than 2,300 U.S. Marines!

Wear Down and Exhaust the Aggressors

During the Guam conference, U.S. military and political leaders boasted that the war in Vietnam had reached a "favorable turning point" and felt "greatly encouraged." However, the failure of the "dry season offensive" and the continuous defeats in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region have deflated their spirits. A Western newspaper reported that at a banquet in Washington in late April, U.S. President Johnson "almost cried" when talking about the Vietnam War to seven hundred guests.

In order to evade the punishment of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces and cover up their criminal activities of expanding the war, the U.S. imperialists proposed on April 19 to expand the demilitarized zone by ten miles on both the southern and northern sides and to stop all military activities in the demilitarized zone. This proposal was sternly rejected by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

For many years, the U.S. has repeatedly violated the regulations regarding the demilitarized zone, using it to commit countless atrocities against the Vietnamese people. In February of this year, the U.S. aggressors again set up long-range artillery in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, continuously shelling North Vietnam. Thus, they have fundamentally nullified the demilitarized zone and placed themselves in a position to be jointly attacked by the Vietnamese People's Army and the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces. In the powerful offensive launched by the Liberation Armed Forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region since April, the artillery units of the Vietnamese People's Army, in order to punish the U.S. aggressors, have repeatedly shelled the long-range artillery positions of the U.S. aggressors south of the demilitarized zone, directly supporting the offensive of the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces.

The U.S. aggressors are not willing to accept their defeat. They are desperately recruiting cannon fodder, trying to continue to cling on. However, the heroic Vietnamese people will persist in the war, wear down and exhaust the U.S. aggressors, and achieve the final victory in the war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    发动近两年来的最大攻势　严惩美帝的战争“升级”行动
    南越解放军在非军事区南侧打了大胜仗
    本报记者述评　英雄的越南南方解放武装力量，最近在非军事区南侧对美国侵略军发动了近两年来规模最大的一次攻势，取得了十分重大的胜利。仅仅在四月二十四日到五月七日的十四天中，就歼敌二千八百多名，其中包括美国侵略军二千一百名。
    南越解放武装力量的这一强大攻势和辉煌胜利，有力地回击了美帝国主义扩大侵越战争的“升级”罪行，打乱了美国侵略者在南越战场的整个部署。美帝国主义侵略者在遭到这一顿痛击之后，从战地直到西贡和华盛顿，都吵吵嚷嚷，大叫“形势紧急”，又一次在全世界人民面前暴露了纸老虎的原形。
    军民协力掌握主动
    这一仗，是由靠近非军事区南侧的广治—承天两省军民协同作战的。广治、承天紧邻越南北方，这两个省的广大人民有着长期反帝斗争的传统。美国侵略者一向在这两个省驻有重兵。在一九六六——一九六七年的“旱季攻势”中，美军在面积只有九千多平方公里的这两个省内，投入了近两个师的美国海军陆战队和一师伪军，沿九号公路和一号公路两侧进行反复残酷的“扫荡”。侵略者的战略野心，是企图以重兵封锁临时军事分界线，围歼这一地区的南越解放军主力，为把侵略战争从地面上扩大到越南民主共和国和老挝准备条件，以挽救它在整个南越战场上极端困难的处境。
    广治—承天军民发扬敢于斗争、敢于胜利的精神，坚决打击美国侵略者。在今年第一季度中，他们就曾歼灭美伪军一万几千人，解放了九号公路以北和非军事区以南之间二十多公里宽的大片地区。广治—承天解放区的英勇军民，和南越各个解放区根据地军民协同作战，取得了辉煌的胜利。这一光辉胜利标志着南越解放武装力量在指挥水平与作战技术等方面有了新的进步，并牢牢地掌握着战场上的主动权。
    集中兵力速战速决
    毛主席说：“在战术和战役上的速决，是战略上持久的必要条件”。“集中优势兵力，各个歼灭敌人”。
    在四月初展开的大攻势中，广治—承天地区的南越解放武装力量打了一连串漂亮的歼灭战。英勇的南越解放军来如迅雷，去如疾风，打得美伪军蒙头转向，使敌人整营整连地被消灭掉。在四月四日进攻隆寿的战斗中，南越解放武装力量只用几分钟的时间就消灭了二百名伪军。五日夜袭击拉汪镇的战斗中，解放武装力量只用三十分钟，就消灭和瓦解敌人七百五十多人，全歼敌军一个步兵营、一个装甲营、一个炮兵连、一个保安连和一个坦克支队。在六日凌晨袭击广治市内的战斗中，南越解放军杰出地运用了“集中大力，打敌小部”的战术，一举攻入市内，歼敌三百多名。美国海军陆战队总部离这里只有十二英里，也来不及派军驰援。美联社在报道这次战斗时不得不承认，这是“最好的有着毁灭性效果的战术”。
    解放武装力量以炮兵突袭美国侵略军据点、基地、司令机关的打法，也多次取得了光辉战果。在对犹灵、东河、芙拜、昆天等地的炮击中，解放武装力量都消灭了敌人大量有生力量。
    游击战争威力无穷
    毛主席说：“在长期和残酷的战争中，游击战争将表现其很大的威力，实在是非同小可的事业。”
    具有光荣斗争传统的广治—承天游击队，在这次大规模的攻势中发挥了巨大作用，建立了新的功勋。游击队不仅牵制敌军、迷惑敌军，为主力部队的活动创造了必要的条件，而且在广泛展开的战斗活动中，杀伤了大量敌人。无数精干的游击分队神出鬼没，来去自如，要打就打，要撤就撤，打得用飞机大炮武装起来的几万美国侵略军毫无办法。
    四月初，游击队对广治承天的伪军保安队、民卫队和“绥靖干部”的十九个据点，发动了一系列的进攻，打得敌军胆战心惊。游击队还袭击了海陵和兆丰军事专区，炸毁了一号公路上的五座桥梁。
    游击队的地雷战也发挥了很大的威力。四月二十五日，广治省溪星地区的游击队巧摆地雷阵，使一连美军刚一出发就被炸死二十多人。西方报刊承认，非军事区以南某些美军部队的伤亡中，有百分之九十是由地雷造成的，去年一年中，游击队地雷杀伤的美海军陆战队达二千三百多人！
    把侵略者拖垮拖死
    在关岛会议期间美帝军政头目曾经大吹大擂，说侵越战争已经达到“有利的转折点”，“感到很大的鼓舞”。但是，“旱季攻势”的惨败，在广治—承天地区不断挨打，使他们一下子泄了气。一家西方报纸报道说，在四月下旬在华盛顿举行的一次宴会上，美国总统约翰逊“在向七百名客人谈到越南战争时几乎要哭了”。
    美帝国主义为了逃避南越解放武装力量的惩罚和掩饰它扩大战争的罪恶活动，今年四月十九日提出什么非军事区南部和北部各扩大十英里，并且停止非军事区的一切军事活动的建议。这个建议遭到了越南民主共和国义正辞严的拒绝。
    多年来美国不断破坏关于非军事区的规定，利用非军事区对越南人民干尽了坏事。今年二月，美国侵略军又在非军事区南侧架设远程重炮，不断轰击越南北方。这样，它们就从根本上勾销了非军事区，并把自己放在越南人民军和南越解放武装力量联合夹击的地位上。在四月以来的广治—承天地区解放武装力量强大攻势中，越南人民军炮兵部队，为了惩罚美国侵略者，曾多次炮击美侵略军在非军事区南侧的远程炮兵阵地，直接支援南越解放武装力量的进攻。
    美国侵略者是不甘心它的失败的。它正在拚命搜罗炮灰，想继续赖下去。但是，英雄的越南人民一定要持久而战，把美国侵略者拖垮拖死，取得抗美救国战争的最后胜利。（附图片）
