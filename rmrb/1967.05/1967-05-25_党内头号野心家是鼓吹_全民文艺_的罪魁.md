In 1962, at a time when our national economy was facing temporary difficulties and class struggle was intensifying both domestically and internationally, the top capitalist-roader in the Party incited a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles to orchestrate a grand conspiracy under the guise of commemorating "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They used the commemoration as a cover to distort and attack the "Talks." They convened counterrevolutionary black meetings, published poisonous articles, and mobilized all counterrevolutionary forces to launch a frenzied counterattack against the dictatorship of the proletariat and proletarian literature and art.

Debts must be repaid. The heinous crimes of the small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, along with their mastermind, the top capitalist-roader in the Party, in viciously attacking and distorting the "Talks" must be thoroughly settled. The poison they spread must be thoroughly purged.

I.

The question of whose side literature and art are on is a fundamental and principled issue, one that concerns the overall direction of proletarian literature and art. The direction set by the "Talks" of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers has established the position of the workers, peasants, and soldiers as masters in the realm of literature and art, and has overturned the historical inversion. This is a comprehensive revolution in the realm of literature and art in accordance with Marxism-Leninism.

With the support of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the clique of Zhou Yang and Lin Mo-han brazenly opposed the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In their two poisonous articles, "Serving the Broadest Masses of the People" and "The Unity, Tempering, and Improvement of the Literary and Artistic Cadres," they used the commemoration of the "Talks" as a pretext to openly propose the slogan of "mass art." The articles stated: "Today, the objects and scope of literary and artistic service are broader than ever before. Our literature and art should serve the broadest masses of the people," claiming that "the situation today is different" and that the objects of literary and artistic service should include "all democratic parties and personages, patriotic national bourgeoisie elements, patriotic overseas Chinese, and all other patriotic people" within the "entire people." They more brazenly claimed in private that our literature is "the literature of the entire people and all humanity," that the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is "outdated," and that today's literature and art should be accepted by all kinds of people, that literary works should "reflect the interests of all classes" and "resonate with all people." This is sheer nonsense.

"Mass art" is not some new idea; it is a rehash of the "transcendent class art" peddled by Chiang Kai-shek's lackey, Liang Shi-qiu, and is a thoroughly bourgeois fallacy that Chairman Mao criticized in the "Talks." In the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie dare not openly demand that literature and art serve the interests of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, through bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, they use a seemingly impartial two-faced approach to hypocritically declare that literature and art should "reflect the interests of all the people" and be "accepted by all kinds of people." This is a common trick of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao said: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Art for art's sake, transcendent class art, and art that is parallel to or independent of politics, do not exist in reality." Literature and art, as a form of ideology, always serve the politics of a certain class. In class society, past, present, and future, there will never be and absolutely cannot have so-called "mass art" that is shared by different classes. Ask: Can revolutionary model operas like "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," "The Red Lantern," and "The White-Haired Girl" reflect the "interests" of the landlord and bourgeois classes? Can they resonate with them and be "accepted" by them? On the contrary, can "The City That Never Sleeps" and "The Lin Family Shop" reflect the interests of the proletariat? Can they be accepted by the proletariat and resonate with them? No, absolutely not! The so-called "mass art" is an extremely hypocritical slogan proposed by a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists to cater to the needs of the bourgeoisie. Under the pretext of "reflecting the interests of all the people," they oppose literature and art serving the politics of the proletariat, essentially reflecting the interests of the bourgeoisie; under the pretext of literature and art being "accepted by all kinds of people," they essentially want to change the revolutionary nature of proletarian literature and art into something that the bourgeoisie can "accept."

The intense class struggle on the literary and artistic front has completely exposed the lies of "mass art." In 1962, at a time when class struggle was particularly sharp both domestically and internationally, the leaders of the literary and artistic black line, under the pretext of serving "all people," issued passes for the release of demons and monsters, causing the literary and artistic circles to be overrun with poisonous weeds and evil winds, creating a filthy atmosphere. The top capitalist-roader in the Party acted as the commander-in-chief, mobilizing the reactionary forces in the literary and artistic circles to launch a frenzied counterattack against the dictatorship of the proletariat. It was he who advocated importing so-called "harmless" films, opening the door wide to the West, and providing convenient conditions for the infiltration of capitalist and revisionist thoughts into socialist China; it was he who advocated performing "traditional operas," approving the "opening of plays," and allowing emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties to dominate the stage; it was he who raised the black flag of "exposure literature," calling on writers to "write about darkness," "write about disasters," "write about shortcomings," and inciting writers to attack the Three Red Banners, attack the Party's leadership, and oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat. What kind of "mass art" is this? It is completely a counterrevolutionary literature and art serving the bourgeoisie and a small clique of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists!

The reactionary slogan of "mass art" was carefully crafted by a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles in accordance with the instructions of their mastermind, the top capitalist-roader in the Party. The top capitalist-roader in the Party went to great lengths to blur class boundaries, eagerly beautifying the bourgeoisie, claiming that capitalists have become "new-style capitalists" and are "gradually transforming into genuine laborers," that they "no longer want to resist socialism." He used such bewitching language to try to make the proletariat lose vigilance against the bourgeoisie. He fervently advocated the theory of the extinction of class struggle, claiming that "the question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism in our country has been resolved," that "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended." He painted a blueprint of a "nation of the entire people": workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and capitalists respecting each other, each getting their due, living in peace and not invading each other. This is a genuine plan for a bourgeois utopia. It is clear that the theoretical basis of "mass art" comes from the top capitalist-roader in the Party. He, like Khrushchev of the Soviet revisionists, is a fervent advocate of the theory of the "nation of the entire people" and the extinction of class struggle. "Mass art" is merely the reflection and concretization of the theory of the "nation of the entire people" in the realm of literature and art.

The theory of "mass art" is completely for the service of the bourgeoisie and for the service of the bourgeoisie's restoration of capitalism. It is, like the theory of the extinction of class struggle and the "nation of the entire people" advocated by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, a poison that the bourgeoisie uses to numb the revolutionary consciousness of the proletariat, to dismantle the revolutionary will of the proletariat, and a means for the bourgeoisie to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and achieve a counterrevolutionary restoration of capitalism.

II.

Without a revolutionary literary and artistic cadre, there can be no revolutionary literature and art. Only by establishing a highly revolutionary and combat-ready literary and artistic cadre can we truly establish a new proletarian literature and art and ensure the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Since liberation, there has been a struggle between reform and counter-reform, between "peaceful evolution" and anti-"peaceful evolution," and between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line in the literary and artistic cadre.

Chairman Mao said: "Various forms of art—drama, storytelling, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, and there are many people. The socialist transformation in many departments has so far been ineffective..." Chairman Mao pointed out with precision: "These associations and the magazines they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have, for the most part, over the past fifteen years, basically (not everyone) not executed the Party's policies, acted as officials and lords, not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably one day become like the Petőfi Club in Hungary." However, a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles released smoke screens, maliciously beautifying the current state of the literary and artistic cadre, covering up the sharp class struggle within the literary and artistic cadre, numbing the class vigilance of the revolutionary proletarian faction, and providing guarantees and umbrellas for the demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles. They claimed that "over the past twenty years, a strong literary and artistic cadre of the working people has been formed," that this cadre "is increasingly united with the masses," and that their "ideas and feelings have undergone fundamental changes." The root of this viewpoint comes from the top capitalist-roader in the Party. This "big shot" as early as 1956 set the tone, saying that "the intellectuals have changed their original appearance and formed a cadre serving socialism." In 1960, he said, "The literary and artistic cadre of the working class should be said to have been formed," that the problems in the literary and artistic circles are now "internal contradictions among the people" and that "class struggle methods" should not be used. Therefore, "the method of anti-rightist struggle" should not be adopted, but rather "a method of compromise."

In the two poisonous articles commemorating the 20th anniversary of the "Talks," they did not mention the class struggle within the literary and artistic cadre, claiming that writers only have the distinction of being old or young, Party members or non-Party members, and no longer have the distinction of being proletarian or bourgeois. These two articles shouted at the top of their lungs that Party and non-Party, young and old writers should "cooperate for a long time," that they should "mutually respect, help, and learn from each other." This high-sounding talk of "unity" and this advocacy of the "extinction of class struggle" are clearly intended to protect and expand the bourgeois literary and artistic cadre, to corrupt and destroy the proletarian literary and artistic cadre, so that under the cover of "unity," they can devour the proletarian literary and artistic cadre; and to protect the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat, to add fuel to the fire of the counterrevolutionary counterattack by the demons and monsters, and to add fuel to the fire of their attack on the Party and socialism. This clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists is so servile to the bourgeoisie, but to the revolutionary proletarian faction, they put on a fierce face, arrogantly scolding, claiming that "some people do not regard artistic workers as laborers, saying they are bourgeoisie, from the old society.... Do not regard yourself as a reformer, it is a profession; others are the reformed, as if there is a division of labor. Can we sometimes switch? Mutual reform, mutual help. First, change this relationship of ruling and being ruled, reforming and being reformed, and replace it with an equal, mutually respectful, mutually learning, and intimate comradely relationship." Look, how arrogant their counterrevolutionary spirit is! Is it that the proletariat does not reform the bourgeoisie, but should be reformed by the bourgeoisie? Is it that the proletariat does not rule the bourgeoisie, but should let the bourgeoisie rule the proletariat?

For artistic workers, we have always advocated using Marxism's views on class and class struggle to adopt an analytical attitude. Relying on the revolutionary proletarian faction within the literary and artistic cadre, uniting the intermediate faction, and striking and isolating the rightist faction to the greatest extent possible is our consistent and firm class policy. Due to the long-term implementation of a capitulationist line by the Zhou Yang clique, a proletarian literary and artistic cadre with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the main body has not truly been formed. Among the "old" writers from the "old society" and the old intellectuals, there are quite a few who are genuine bourgeois elements, some are reactionary academic "authorities," some are historical counterrevolutionaries, traitors, rightists who escaped punishment. These people regard themselves as "old men," "seniors," and "experts," like time bombs hidden within the revolutionary literary and artistic cadre. The practice of class struggle shows that these demons and monsters are the backbone of counterrevolutionary restoration. Can we talk about "unity" and "respect" with these people? No, our struggle with them is a struggle to the death, and there is no question of equality. As for the majority of intellectuals from the old society, although they support the Party and socialism, their worldview has not been thoroughly reformed. They always try to reform literature, the Party, and the world according to the bourgeois worldview. Therefore, we must insist on carrying out the class struggle of eliminating bourgeois elements and promoting proletarian elements on the ideological front. To give up ideological struggle is to tolerate the bourgeoisie infiltrating and disintegrating our cadre.

What "unity," what "extinction of class struggle," all are lies of the bourgeoisie. They let the proletariat talk about "unity" with the bourgeoisie, let the proletariat "extinguish" class struggle against the bourgeoisie, but they have never extinguished their class struggle against the proletariat, and they have never talked about "unity" with the revolutionary proletarian faction. They raised the Nationalist Party's tutelage, surrounded and suppressed the revolutionary proletarian faction, and implemented a counterrevolutionary revisionist organizational line in the literary and artistic cadre, striking down one batch, protecting one batch, and corrupting one batch, trying to change the color of our literary and artistic cadre and turn it into a counterrevolutionary restoration organization like the Petőfi Club in Hungary.

(1) They suppressed the revolutionary proletarian faction and new forces in the literary and artistic circles. With the top capitalist-roader in the Party as their backer, they used their authority to suppress and strike down the revolutionary forces within the literary and artistic cadre. They suppressed the criticism of the reactionary film "The Secret History of the Palace"; they suppressed the criticism of "The Criticism of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' Research" by the "little people"; they obstructed theatrical reform and struck down the revolutionary faction in the theatrical circles; they excluded, struck down, and surrounded the vanguard fighters of the proletarian cultural revolution. How vile their intentions are!

(2) They protected the demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles. Under the support of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the leaders of the literary and artistic black line have long been engaged in factionalism, recruiting and surrendering, and gathering counterrevolutionary forces. The top capitalist-roader in the Party even protected the Hu Feng counterrevolutionary clique, claiming to "adopt a helping attitude... and not to overthrow." The leaders of the literary and artistic black line also imitated their master, sheltering all counterrevolutionary forces. They defended traitors, saying, "A person who has betrayed the revolutionary ranks... may have some understandable reasons"; they claimed that rightists were "misled and followed the crowd"; they called those bourgeois elements who were criticized and struggled against "good comrades"; they maliciously attacked the dictatorship of the proletariat for "suppressing" talents, and with ulterior motives, said, "It is not a problem of having no thousand-mile horses, but of having no Berlek," implying that under the socialist system, there is no good leadership, so countless talents are buried. They regarded themselves as Berlek, overturned the cases of all demons and monsters, gathered social dregs, and gave them important positions to serve their counterrevolutionary restoration.

(3) They corrupted the revolutionary literary and artistic cadre, conspiring to carry out a peaceful evolution of the revolutionary literary and artistic cadre, and change the color of the revolutionary literary and artistic cadre.

They wielded the stick of "simplification" and "vulgarization," opposing artistic workers from studying Chairman Mao's works, and maliciously cursing the boundless Mao Zedong Thought as "mysticism," slandering and defaming those who took Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle as "nuns and monks." They feared the great power of Mao Zedong Thought to reform people and did everything they could to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, using every means to obstruct the arming of artistic workers' minds with Mao Zedong Thought.

They did everything they could to prevent artistic workers from entering the fiery struggle of life, uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, claiming that "it is also possible to unite without going to the workers, peasants, and soldiers." They exaggerated the role of artistic practice, claiming that without deepening into the masses of workers and peasants, artistic practice alone could "achieve the effect of ideological reform." They let artistic workers detach from the struggle, enter the study, learn "algebra, geometry, calculus...," and "cultivate themselves." They vigorously promoted bourgeois experts, claiming that "those who are truly cultured are the old bourgeois experts," that they should learn from them for half a century, that "no matter what wind comes, do not be shaken," and that artistic workers should kneel before the bourgeois experts and become captives of the bourgeoisie.

They also vigorously promoted material incentives, buying out talents at high prices, using fame and wealth to corrupt the revolutionary literary and artistic cadre. The top capitalist-roader in the Party, in order to meet his needs for counterrevolutionary restoration, personally issued a black directive to "establish a fund committee" to "solve the travel expenses and creation subsidies of writers." The leaders of the literary and artistic black line, in accordance with the instructions of their master, vigorously promoted the revisionist policy of "three highs"—high salary, high manuscript fee, and high bonus—to lure artistic workers to strive for fame and fortune. They tried to create a batch of Chinese Sholokhovs and Yevtushenkos, cultivate batch after batch of spiritual aristocrats who are detached from the masses and the struggle, to serve their counterrevolutionary restoration.

III.

Advocating "mass art" inevitably leads to advocating bourgeois "liberalization," distorting the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" into a policy of bourgeois "liberalization."

The policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is proposed by Chairman Mao based on the fact that class struggle still exists in socialist society. It is our Party's firm class policy. It is an important method to strengthen and consolidate the leading position of Mao Zedong Thought in the ideological realm, to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in all realms, and is also an important measure to promote the prosperity and development of socialist culture in our country.

Under the support of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, in order to achieve their unspoken political purposes, stood on the side of the bourgeoisie, deliberately erasing the clear class nature of the "hundred flowers and hundred schools" policy, and distorting it into a policy of bourgeois "liberalization." The proletariat, through the "hundred flowers and hundred schools" policy, consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat and carries out the struggle to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements in the ideological realm; the bourgeoisie and their agents within the Party, however, do the opposite. They use the "legitimacy" of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" to attack the socialist system and carry out the struggle to eliminate proletarian elements and promote bourgeois elements in the ideological realm, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. To achieve this goal, they oppose the Party's leadership, oppose Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, and oppose Marxist literary criticism.

"The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China." The Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for ensuring the proletarian direction of literature and art. Without the Party's leadership, "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom" can only be the "monopoly of one school" and the "monopoly of one flower" of the bourgeoisie, which can only lead to the free spread of bourgeois thoughts. Under the support of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, the leaders of the literary and artistic black line viciously attacked the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work, clearing obstacles for bourgeois "liberalization," and opening convenient doors for the release of demons and monsters. They attacked the Party's leadership of literary and artistic work as "simple administrative methods," "rude interference," "causing harm to the development of literature and art," and "becoming the main obstacle to the realization of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend'"; they attacked the Party's leadership as "pretending to be experts," issuing orders, and binding the hands and feet of writers like a rope, causing their creativity to be "frustrated" and "suppressed." In short, the Party's leadership is simply the "source of all evil." They fiercely incited bourgeois writers to "vent their anger" against the Party, viciously incited bourgeois rightists to "struggle" against the Party, claiming that "the current conditions are good, we should stand up and struggle," calling on and mobilizing demons and monsters to overthrow the Party's leadership, let the bourgeoisie "take the stage," seize the power of the proletariat, and make literature and art a stronghold for counterrevolutionary restoration.

Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all our work and the soul of all our work. The bourgeoisie, in order to implement the policy of "liberalization," must regard Mao Zedong Thought as an obstacle and hindrance to the implementation of "liberalization." Therefore, they fear and hate Mao Zedong Thought to death. They vigorously denigrate and slander its great role, claiming that "the situation today is different from twenty years ago," that the regulations of the "Talks" are "outdated." They raised the banner of "innovation," slandering Mao Zedong Thought as "old sayings," claiming that the literary and artistic circles are "full of old sayings," that there are "too many frameworks," and shouting to "break the old sayings," to "innovate," slandering the highest directives as the "god" and "spell" that stifles creativity. Their "innovation" is nothing but their black words against Mao Zedong Thought, nothing but their request to stubbornly express their worldview and propagate bourgeois thoughts. Mao Zedong Thought is our guiding light. The more they oppose Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in all realms.

To implement bourgeois "liberalization," they must oppose Marxist literary criticism. The top capitalist-roader in the Party openly shouted: "Now there is too much literary criticism, especially oral criticism and nitpicking." He slandered the great leader's personal leadership of the criticism of "The Biography of Wu Xun" and "The Criticism of 'Dream of the Red Chamber' Research" as "rude," as "the Party and government taking political interference," and "interfering wrongly." The leaders of the literary and artistic black line also hated Marxist literary criticism to the bone. They attacked Marxist literary criticism as "excessive," "leftist," "labeling," "sticking labels," "simplification," "formulaic," and "conceptual," shouting to "break free from dogmatism in thought and from administrative methods in organization." What they attacked is the revolutionary soul of Marxism, and what they opposed is the combativeness of Marxist literary criticism.

To let bourgeois thoughts occupy the cultural front and compete with the proletariat for leadership, they step by step, layer by layer, set up obstacles, blocking the spread of proletarian thoughts and resisting the proletariat's struggle to seize power from the bourgeoisie. Sometimes they raised the banner of "establishing before destroying," not allowing the proletariat to revolutionize, actually not allowing the destruction of bourgeois thoughts and not allowing the establishment of proletarian thoughts, letting bourgeois thoughts spread freely; sometimes they raised the black flag of "equality before truth," gathering the bourgeoisie's forces, launching a rampant attack on the proletariat, and implementing a dictatorship over the proletariat; sometimes they put on the air of Zhao Taijie, wielding the stick of "opposing academic cliqueism," brutally suppressing and not allowing the revolution of the proletarian faction in the academic circles; sometimes they hard-pressed political issues into academic issues, using the cloak of academia to cover up their counterrevolutionary evil deeds.

Opposing the Party's leadership, opposing Mao Zedong Thought taking the lead, opposing Marxist literary criticism, what is all this for? What do they want to "let bloom" and "let contend"? What kind of "freedom" do they want? What they "let bloom" is the "flower" of the bourgeoisie, and what they "let contend" is the "sound" of the bourgeoisie. The "freedom" they want is the freedom for bourgeois thoughts to spread, the freedom for demons and monsters to come out, the freedom for bourgeois rightists to attack the proletarian revolutionary faction, and ultimately, the freedom to engage in counterrevolutionary activities. Their "freedom" smells of copper and blood. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. If we follow them, it will be ruthless to the people, and our red and prosperous land will change color.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party is the root of advocating "mass art"; he is the mastermind behind the peaceful evolution of the literary and artistic cadre; he is the ringleader in advocating bourgeois "liberalization" and inciting the demons and monsters in the literary and artistic circles to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat. He is the chief culprit in advocating "mass art."

Around 1962, the class struggle was particularly sharp both domestically and internationally. In such a political climate, the top capitalist-roader in the Party thought the time was ripe and began to spread evil winds, inciting his followers in various fields to launch a comprehensive attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat, while extending his black hand into the literary and artistic circles, inciting a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat. Before and after the two poisonous articles commemorating the 20th anniversary of the "Talks" were published, a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, under his instructions and support, carried out a series of counterrevolutionary conspiracy activities. Before these two poisonous articles were published, they formulated a counterrevolutionary revisionist literary and artistic policy in 1961; after these two poisonous articles were published, they held a black meeting in Dalian in 1962, fiercely attacking the Three Red Banners and the dictatorship of the proletariat. All these meetings were genuine counterrevolutionary meetings. We must expose the black curtain of these meetings and reveal the ugly faces of a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists in broad daylight.

Literature and art have always been tools of class struggle. The top Party intriguer's control over literature and art is completely for the service of his counterrevolutionary restoration, for his usurpation of the Party, the army, and the government, and for creating public opinion to seize power from the proletariat. We must overthrow this Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly uproot this root of capitalist restoration, and seize back the leadership he and his followers have usurped in various fields, so that our country will never change color!

    党内头号野心家是鼓吹“全民文艺”的罪魁
    首都批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”联络委员会
    一九六二年，正当我国国民经济暂时困难，国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐的时候，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派唆使文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，有组织、有计划地搞了一个“纪念”《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的大阴谋。他们借纪念《讲话》为名，行篡改、攻击《讲话》之实。他们大开反革命黑会，大发毒草文章，调动一切反革命力量，向无产阶级专政和无产阶级文艺进行疯狂的大反扑。
    欠债总是要还的。文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，以及他们的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派恶毒攻击、篡改《讲话》的滔天罪行，必须彻底清算，他们散布的流毒，必须彻底肃清。
    一
    文艺为什么人的问题，是一个根本的原则性的问题，是无产阶级文艺的大方向的问题。《讲话》制定的为工农兵服务的文艺方向，确立了工农兵在文艺方面主人翁的地位，把被颠倒了的历史再颠倒过来。这是马克思列宁主义在文艺方面进行的一个全面的大革命。
    周扬、林默涵一伙在他们的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，肆无忌惮地反对为工农兵服务的文艺方向。他们在《为最广大的人民群众服务》和《文艺队伍的团结、锻炼和提高》两株大毒草中，打着“纪念”《讲话》的幌子，公然提出了“全民文艺”的口号。文章说：“今天文艺服务的对象和范围，比过去任何时期都更加广泛了。我们的文艺应当为全国最广大的群众服务”，说什么“今天的情况不同”了，我们文艺的服务对象要包括“各民主党派和民主人士，爱国的民族资产阶级分子”、“爱国侨胞和其他一切爱国人士”在内的“全体人民”。他们私下更露骨地胡说我们的文学“是全民的全人类的文学”，为工农兵服务的方向“已经过时了”，今天的“文艺要为各种人所接受”，文艺作品“既反映阶级的利益，又反映全体人民的利益”，“它是给所有阶级看的，引起所有人的共鸣”。这完全是一派胡言。
    “全民文艺”并不是什么新鲜的货色，它是蒋介石的御用文人梁实秋之流早就贩卖过的“超阶级文艺”的翻版，是毛主席在《讲话》中痛加斥责过的彻头彻尾的资产阶级谬论。资产阶级在无产阶级专政的条件下，不敢公开要求文艺为资产阶级的利益服务，因而通过混入无产阶级专政机构的资产阶级代表人物，采取貌似公正的两面派手法，虚伪地表白文艺要“反映全体人民的利益”，要“为各种人所接受”。这是资产阶级惯用的伎俩。
    毛主席说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。为艺术的艺术，超阶级的艺术，和政治并行或互相独立的艺术，实际上是不存在的。”文艺作为一种意识形态，总是为一定阶级的政治服务的。在阶级社会里，过去、现在、将来都不会也绝不可能有为不同阶级所共有的所谓“全民文艺”。试问：革命样板戏《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》等等，能反映地主资产阶级的“利益”吗？能引起他们的“共鸣”，为他们“所接受”吗？相反，《不夜城》、《林家铺子》能反映无产阶级的利益吗？能为无产阶级所接受吗？能引起无产阶级的共鸣吗？不能，绝对不能！所谓“全民文艺”，是一小撮反革命修正主义分子适应资产阶级的需要而提出来的极端虚伪的口号。他们打着“反映全体人民的利益”的幌子，反对文艺为无产阶级的政治服务，实质上反映资产阶级的利益；他们打着文艺要为“各种人所接受”的幌子，实质上是要改变无产阶级文艺的革命性质，变成资产阶级所能“接受”的东西。
    文艺战线上惊心动魄的阶级斗争，完全戳穿了“全民文艺”的谎言。一九六二年，正当国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐的时候，文艺黑线的头目们打着文艺为“所有人”服务的幌子，为牛鬼蛇神大批出笼发放通行证，使文艺界顿时毒草丛生，妖风四起，一片污浊气氛。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派充当了调动文艺界的反动势力，向无产阶级专政进行疯狂反扑的总指挥。是他，主张进口所谓“无害”的电影，向西方大开门，为资本主义、修正主义思想对社会主义中国的侵袭大开方便之门；是他，提倡大演“传统戏”，点头“开放剧目”，让帝王将相、才子佳人霸占了戏剧舞台；是他，树起“暴露文学”的黑旗，号召作家“写黑暗”、“写灾难”、“写缺点”，煽动作家攻击三面红旗，攻击党的领导，反对无产阶级专政。这是什么“全民文艺”？完全是为资产阶级服务，为一小撮地、富、反、坏、右服务的反革命文艺！
    “全民文艺”这个反动口号，是文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子遵照他们的总后台、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意精心制作出来的。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派千方百计混淆阶级界限，竭力美化资产阶级，胡说什么资本家已经成为“新式资本家”了，正在“逐步转变为名副其实的劳动者”，“他们已经不愿意反抗社会主义了”。他用这种蛊惑人心的语言，企图使无产阶级丧失对资产阶级的警惕性。他狂热地鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，胡说什么“我国社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了”，“国内主要阶级的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”。他给人们描绘了一幅“全民国家”的蓝图：“工人、农民、小资产阶级、资本家互相尊重，各得其所”，和平共处、互不侵犯。这是一个道道地地的资产阶级理想王国的方案。十分清楚，“全民文艺”的理论根据来自党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。他同苏修的赫鲁晓夫一样，是“全民国家”论和“阶级斗争熄灭”论的狂热鼓吹者。“全民文艺”只不过是“全民国家”论在文艺上的反映和具体化。
    “全民文艺”论完全是为资产阶级服务的，完全是为资产阶级复辟资本主义服务的。它同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的阶级斗争熄灭论、“全民国家”论一样，是资产阶级用来麻痹无产阶级的革命意识、瓦解无产阶级的革命斗志的一剂毒药，是资产阶级用来推翻无产阶级专政、实现资本主义反革命复辟的一种手段。
    二
    没有革命化的文艺队伍，便没有革命的文艺。只有建立起一支非常革命化、战斗化的文艺队伍，才能真正建立起无产阶级的新文艺，才能确保文艺为工农兵服务的方向。
    解放以来，在文艺队伍问题上，一直存在着改造与反改造，“和平演变”与反“和平演变”，无产阶级革命路线与资产阶级反动路线的斗争。
    毛主席说：“各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微……”，毛主席一针见血地指出：“这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。”然而，文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子却大放烟幕，居心叵测地美化文艺队伍的现状，以掩盖文艺队伍中尖锐的阶级斗争，麻痹无产阶级革命派的阶级警惕性，给文艺界的牛鬼蛇神打保票，提供保护伞。他们胡说什么“二十年来形成了一支坚强的劳动人民的文艺队伍”，这个队伍“同群众的结合日益加深”，“思想感情发生了根本变化。”这种观点的总根源是来自党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。这个“大人物”早在一九五六年便定下了调子，说什么“知识界已经改了原来的面貌，组成了一支为社会主义服务的队伍”。一九六○年又说：“工人阶级的文艺队伍应该说已经形成了”，文艺界“现在的问题都是人民内部矛盾的问题，不能采取阶级斗争的办法了。”因此，“不要采取反右的作法”了，而要“用妥协的办法”。
    在纪念《讲话》发表二十周年的两株毒草中，绝口不谈文艺队伍中的阶级斗争，作家只有年老的和年轻的之分，党的和非党的之分，没有无产阶级和资产阶级之分了。这两篇文章声嘶力竭地叫嚷党和非党，年轻和年老的作家要“长期地合作共事”，“要互相尊重，互相帮助，互相学习”。这种高唱“团结”的论调，这种宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”的言论，分明是为保全、扩充资产阶级的文艺队伍，腐蚀、破坏无产阶级的文艺队伍打掩护，以便在“团结”的烟幕下，把无产阶级的文艺队伍吃掉；并且掩护资产阶级向无产阶级进攻，为资产阶级进行反革命反扑柴上浇油，为牛鬼蛇神向党向社会主义进攻火上加薪。这伙反革命修正主义分子对资产阶级是那样的奴颜婢膝，对无产阶级革命派却摆出一副“活阎王”的凶相，蛮横地训斥，胡说什么“有人不把艺术工作者看成劳动者，说他们是资产阶级、旧社会来的。……不要把自己当成改造者，是职业；人家是被改造者，好象各有分工。是否有时也可以换一下？互相改造，互相帮助。首先要改变这种统治和被统治，改造和被改造的关系，代之以平等的、互相尊重、互相学习、亲密无间的同志关系。”请看，他们的反革命气焰何等嚣张！难道无产阶级不去改造资产阶级，反而应该被资产阶级所改造吗？难道无产阶级不去统治资产阶级，反而应该让资产阶级来统治无产阶级吗？
    对于文艺工作者，我们向来主张用马克思主义关于阶级、阶级斗争的观点，采取分析的态度。依靠文艺队伍中的无产阶级革命派，团结中间派，打击并最大限度地孤立右派，是我们一贯坚定的阶级政策。由于周扬一伙长期以来推行一条投降主义路线，文艺界的一支以工农兵为主体的无产阶级的文艺队伍并没有真正形成。从“旧社会来的”老作家，旧的知识分子，他们中间有为数不少的人是道道地地的资产阶级分子，有的是反动的学术“权威”，有的是历史反革命、汉奸、叛徒、漏网右派。这些人以“老头子”、“老前辈”、“老专家”自居，象定时炸弹一样埋藏在革命的文艺队伍的内部。阶级斗争的实践表明，这些牛鬼蛇神是反革命复辟的中坚力量。对于这些人，我们能讲“团结”、“尊重”吗？不能，我们同他们的斗争是你死我活的斗争，丝毫谈不到什么平等。至于从旧社会来的知识分子中间的多数人，尽管是拥护党拥护社会主义的，但他们的世界观并没有得到彻底的改造，他们总是企图按照资产阶级的世界观来改造文艺、改造党、改造世界。因此，我们必须在思想战线上坚持开展灭资兴无的阶级斗争，以斗争求团结。放弃思想斗争，便是容忍资产阶级来侵蚀、瓦解我们的队伍。
    什么“团结”呀，什么阶级斗争“熄灭”呀，统统是资产阶级骗人的鬼话。他们让无产阶级向资产阶级讲
  “团结”，让无产阶级“熄灭”对资产阶级的阶级斗争，但是他们对无产阶级的阶级斗争从来没有熄灭过，他们对无产阶级革命派是从来不讲“团结”的。他们抬出国民党的训政，对无产阶级革命派进行围剿和镇压，在文艺队伍中推行一条反革命修正主义的组织路线，打击一批，保护一批，腐蚀一批，企图改变我们文艺队伍的颜色，把它变成为反革命复辟服务的象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
    （一）他们打击文艺界的无产阶级革命派和新生力量。他们有党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派作靠山，利用职权，压制、打击文艺队伍中的革命力量。他们压制对反动影片《清宫秘史》的批判；他们压制“小人物”对《红楼梦研究》的批判；他们阻拦戏剧改革，打击戏剧界的革命派；他们排斥、打击、围攻无产阶级文化大革命中的先锋战士。用心何其毒也！
    （二）他们保护文艺界的牛鬼蛇神。文艺黑线的头目们在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，长期以来结党营私，招降纳叛，收罗反革命力量。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竟然保护胡风反革命集团，声称要“采取帮助的态度……，不要打倒”。文艺黑线的头目们也学着他们的总后台的样子，庇护一切反革命力量。他们为叛徒辩护说：“一个从革命队伍中叛变的人……其中也许有情有可原的地方”；他们胡说右派“是糊里糊涂跟着起哄”搞成的；他们称“受批评，挨斗争”的资产阶级分子是“好同志”；他们诽谤历次政治批判运动是“过火”，“有些批判是错误的”；他们恶毒地攻击无产阶级专政“抹杀”人才，还别有用心地说“不患无千里马，而患无伯乐”，言外之意就是说，社会主义制度下没有好领导，所以千万个人才都埋没了。他们以伯乐自居，为一切牛鬼蛇神翻案，网罗社会渣滓，予以重用，为他们进行反革命复辟服务。
    （三）他们腐蚀革命的文艺队伍，阴谋对革命的文艺队伍进行和平演变，使革命的文艺队伍改变颜色。
    他们挥舞起“简单化”、“庸俗化”的大棒，反对文艺工作者学习毛主席著作，恶毒咒骂光焰无际的毛泽东思想是“玄学”，诽谤、诬蔑以毛泽东思想为座右铭的人是“修女、修士”。他们害怕毛泽东思想改造人的巨大威力，百般阻挠毛泽东思想的传播，千方百计地阻拦用毛泽东思想武装文艺工作者的头脑。
    他们千方百计地阻拦文艺工作者投入到火热的斗争生活中去，与工农兵相结合，胡说什么不到工农兵中去“也还是可以结合的。”他们夸张艺术实践的作用，胡说什么不要深入工农兵群众，单凭艺术实践便可“收到思想改造的效果”。他们让文艺工作者脱离斗争，走进书斋，学习“代数，几何，微积分……”，进行“修养”。他们拚命吹捧资产阶级专家，说什么“真正有文化的还是资产阶级老专家”，要向他们学“半个世纪”，“什么风来也不要动摇”，要文艺工作者拜倒在资产阶级专家的脚下，成为资产阶级的俘虏。
    他们还大搞物质刺激，高价收买，用名缰利锁腐蚀革命的文艺队伍。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为了适应他进行反革命复辟的需要，培养资产阶级接班人，亲自下达黑指示，“设立基金委员会”“解决作家的旅费和创作津贴”。文艺黑线的头目们遵照他们总后台的意旨，卖劲地推行修正主义的高薪金、高稿酬、高奖金的“三高政策”，引诱文艺工作者为成名成家“努力奋斗”。他们企图通过这些制造一批中国的萧洛霍夫、叶甫图申科，培养一批批脱离群众，脱离斗争的精神贵族，为他们的反革命复辟服务。
    三
    鼓吹“全民文艺”，必然要鼓吹资产阶级“自由化”，把党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策曲解为资产阶级“自由化”的政策。
    “百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针是毛主席根据社会主义社会仍然存在着阶级斗争提出来的。它是我们党的坚定的阶级政策。它是增强、巩固毛泽东思想在意识形态领域中的领导地位、在一切领域里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威的重要方法，也是促进我国社会主义文化繁荣发展的重要措施。
    文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的支持下，为了达到他们不可告人的政治目的，站在资产阶级的立场上，故意抹杀“双百”方针的鲜明的阶级性，把它歪曲为资产阶级“自由化”的政策。无产阶级通过“双百”方针巩固无产阶级专政，在意识形态领域中开展灭资兴无的斗争；资产阶级及其在党内的代理人却反其道而行之，他们借“鸣放”的“合法性”，攻击社会主义制度，在意识形态领域中搞灭无兴资，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。为了达到这个目的，他们反对党的领导，反对毛泽东思想挂帅，反对马克思主义的文艺批评。
    “领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”党的领导是确保文艺的工农兵方向的根本保证。没有党领导的“百家争鸣”“百花齐放”，只能是资产阶级的“一家独鸣”“一花独放”，只能导致资产阶级思想的自由泛滥。文艺黑线的头目们在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，恶毒地攻击党对文艺工作的领导，以为资产阶级“自由化”排除障碍，为牛鬼蛇神出笼打开方便之门。他们攻击党对文艺工作的领导是“简单的行政方式”，是“粗暴的干涉”，“给文艺的发展造成了损害”，“成为了实现‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’的主要障碍”；攻击党的领导是“冒充内行”，发号施令，象
  “绳子”一样“束缚作家的手足”，使他们的创造性受到“挫折”和“压抑”。一句话，党的领导简直是“万恶之源”。他们气势汹汹地鼓动资产阶级作家向党“出气”，恶狠狠地煽动资产阶级右派向党“斗争”，说什么“目前条件很好，我们要起来斗争”，号召、动员牛鬼蛇神起来推翻党的领导，让资产阶级“上台”，专无产阶级的政，使文艺成为反革命复辟的一个据点。
    毛泽东思想是我们一切工作的指导方针，是我们一切工作的灵魂。资产阶级为了推行“自由化”的政策，必然把毛泽东思想视为推行“自由化”的阻力和障碍。因此，他们对毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命。他们极力贬低和诋毁它的伟大作用，胡说什么今天与二十年前的情况“不同了”，《讲话》的规定“过时了”。他们打起“创新”的幌子，污蔑毛泽东思想是“陈言”，说文艺界“陈言充斥”，“条条框框太多”，叫嚷要“破陈言”，要“创新”，把最高指示污蔑为扼杀创造力的“神灵”、“咒语”。他们的“创新”，不过是他们反对毛泽东思想的黑话，不过是他们要求顽强表现自己的世界观、宣传资产阶级思想的借口。毛泽东思想是我们的指路明灯。敌人越是反对毛泽东思想，我们越是要热情宣传毛泽东思想，在一切领域里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    为了推行资产阶级“自由化”，他们必然要反对马克思主义的文艺批评。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派公然叫嚷：“现在对文艺批评太多了，特别是口头批评和评头品足太多了”。他污蔑我们伟大领袖亲自领导的对《武训传》、《红楼梦研究》的批判是“粗暴的”，是“党与政府采取政治上的干涉”，“干涉错了”。文艺黑线的头目们对马克思主义的文艺批评也恨之入骨。他们攻击马克思主义的文艺批评是“过火”，“过左”，“扣帽子”，“贴标签”，“简单化”，“公式化”，“概念化”，叫嚣“要在思想上摆脱教条主义，在组织上摆脱行政方法”。他们所攻击的是马克思主义的革命灵魂，所反对的是马克思主义文艺批评的战斗性。
    为了让资产阶级思想盘据文化阵地，同无产阶级争夺领导权，他们步步为营、层层设防，设置重重障碍，阻挡无产阶级思想的传播，抗拒无产阶级向资产阶级夺权的斗争。他们有时打起“先立后破”的幌子，不准无产阶级革命，实际上是对资产阶级思想不准破，对无产阶级思想不准立，让资产阶级思想自由泛滥；他们有时举起“在真理面前人人平等”的黑旗，纠合资产阶级的队伍，向无产阶级发动猖狂进攻，对无产阶级实行专政；他们有时摆出赵太爷的架势，挥舞着“反对学阀作风”的大棒，对学术界的无产阶级革命派横加打击、残酷镇压、不准革命；他们有时硬把政治问题说成是学术问题，用学术的外衣，来掩盖他们的反革命的罪恶勾当。
    反对党的领导，反对毛泽东思想挂帅，反对马克思主义文艺批评，这一切究竟是为了什么呢？他们究竟要“鸣”什么，“放”什么？他们究竟要什么样的“自由”？他们“放”的是资产阶级之“花”，“鸣”的是资产阶级之“声”。他们要的“自由”，是资产阶级思想泛滥的自由，牛鬼蛇神出笼的自由，资产阶级右派向无产阶级革命派进攻的自由，归根结底一句话，从事反革命活动的自由。他们的“自由”散发着铜臭味和血腥味。这是我们万万不能允许的。依了他们，便是对人民残酷无情，我们红彤彤的大好河山便会改变颜色。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派是鼓吹“全民文艺”的总根子；是对文艺队伍进行“和平演变”的总后台；是鼓吹资产阶级“自由化”、煽动文艺界牛鬼蛇神向无产阶级专政进攻的总头目。他是鼓吹“全民文艺”的罪魁祸首。
    一九六二年前后，国内外阶级斗争非常尖锐。在这样的政治气候下，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以为时机已到，便四处煽阴风，鼓动他手下的党羽，在各个领域向无产阶级专政发动了全面的进攻，同时把他的黑手伸向文艺界，策动文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子向无产阶级专政进攻。在“纪念”《讲话》发表二十周年的两株大毒草出世的前前后后，文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子在他的指使和支持下，搞了一系列反革命的阴谋活动。在这两株毒草出世之前，他们于一九六一年制定了一个反革命修正主义文艺政策；在这两株毒草出笼之后，他们于一九六二年，在大连召开了一个猖狂攻击三面红旗、攻击无产阶级专政的黑会。所有这些会议都是道道地地的反革命会议。必须揭开这些会议的黑幕，把一小撮反革命修正主义分子的丑恶嘴脸暴露在光天化日之下。
    文艺历来是阶级斗争的工具。党内头号野心家抓文艺，完全是为实现他的反革命复辟服务的，是为他篡党篡军篡政，向无产阶级争夺政权制造舆论的。我们必须打倒这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，彻底挖掉这个资本主义复辟的总祸根，把他和他的党羽在各方面所窃取的领导权夺回来，使我们的国家永不变色！
