The working class of Asia and Africa is the core force in the struggle of the Asian and African peoples for national independence and the defense of national independence. Some have bravely joined the armed struggle for national liberation, while others have actively launched mass revolutionary movements against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

The working class of Thailand is rising up to bravely resist the brutal exploitation and oppression of American imperialism and its lackeys. The anti-American struggle of Thai workers inside U.S. military bases is surging. In January of this year, workers constructing the Chiang Mai-Narathiwat strategic highway went on a large-scale strike. Thai workers, peasants, and other patriots are waging a powerful struggle for national liberation, including armed struggle, to drive out the American invaders and overthrow the Thanon-Prapas traitorous clique.

Following more than forty large-scale strikes last year, Filipino workers, in collaboration with students and other masses, have been holding large-scale demonstrations despite government suppression. They strongly protest the escalation of the American war in Vietnam, condemn the use of military bases in the Philippines by the U.S. to invade Vietnam, and oppose the Philippine ruling class acting as a lackey for American imperialism.

Japanese workers and youth have held several large-scale rallies and demonstrations this year, protesting the entry of American nuclear submarines into Japanese ports, demanding the removal of all U.S. military bases in Japan, and condemning American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The struggle of the Japanese working class against modern revisionism is also rapidly developing.

In the tool of neocolonialism, "Malaysia," rubber plantation workers are going on strike en masse. Workers shout slogans such as "Resolutely overthrow the foreign monopoly capitalist groups!" and "American and British imperialism, go back to your own countries!" The working class in this region is bravely rising up to revolt against imperialism and its lackeys.

The working class of India is actively participating in the nationwide struggle against tyranny and for survival, continuously holding large-scale strikes and demonstrations. Slogans such as "Down with the Congress Party," "Long live the revolution," and "Down with American imperialism" have appeared in mass demonstrations. The working class and laboring people of India are becoming increasingly aware.

In occupied South Yemen, Arab workers and citizens of Aden held a general strike and large-scale demonstrations in January. Despite the bloody suppression by British colonialists, the working class of South Yemen continues to hold mass strikes and demonstrations, bravely fighting for the independence of South Yemen.

The working class of Africa strongly opposes American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. The All-Africa Trade Union Federation recently issued a statement severely condemning the crimes of American imperialism in Vietnam, warmly congratulating the great victories of the Vietnamese people, and calling on the peoples of all countries to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.

    亚非工人坚决反对新老殖民主义
    亚非工人阶级是亚非人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争的核心力量。他们有的英勇地投入争取民族解放的武装斗争，有的积极地展开反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的群众革命运动。
    泰国的工人阶级正在奋起英勇反抗美帝国主义及其走狗对他们的残酷剥削和压迫。在美军基地内的泰国工人的反美斗争更是高涨。今年一月，修筑清迈—南邦战略公路的工人举行了大罢工。泰国工人、农民和其他爱国者正在为赶走美国侵略者和推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，展开了包括武装斗争在内的争取民族解放的强大斗争。
    菲律宾工人继去年四十多次规模较大的罢工斗争后，今年又联合学生和其他群众，不顾政府当局的镇压，接连举行大规模的示威，强烈抗议美帝在越南不断进行战争“升级”，谴责美帝利用在菲律宾的军事基地侵略越南，反对菲律宾统治集团给美帝国主义充当帮凶。
    日本工人和青年学生今年多次举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，抗议美帝核潜艇开进日本港口，要求撤除一切在日本的美国军事基地，并谴责美帝国主义侵略越南。日本工人阶级反对现代修正主义的斗争也正在迅速发展。
    在新殖民主义的工具“马来西亚”，橡胶园的工人纷纷举行罢工，工人高呼“坚决打倒外国垄断资本集团”、“美英帝国主义滚回老家去！”等口号。这个地区的工人阶级正在勇敢地起来造帝国主义及其走狗的反。
    印度工人阶级正在积极投入席卷全国的反暴政、争生存的斗争，不断举行大规模的罢工和示威游行。在群众示威中已经出现了“打倒国大党”、“革命万岁”和“打倒美帝国主义”等口号。印度工人阶级和劳动人民也在日益觉醒。
    在被占领的南也门，亚丁的阿拉伯工人和市民在一月份举行了总罢工和大规模示威。此后，不顾英国殖民主义者的血腥镇压，南也门的工人阶级继续不断举行群众性的罢工和示威游行，为争取南也门的独立而英勇斗争。
    非洲工人阶级强烈反对美帝国主义侵略越南。全非工会联合会不久前发表声明，严厉谴责美帝国主义侵略越南的罪行，热烈祝贺越南人民所取得的伟大胜利，并且呼吁各国人民支持越南人民的正义斗争。
