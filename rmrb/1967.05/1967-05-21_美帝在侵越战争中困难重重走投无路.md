The U.S. imperialists are frantically expanding the Vietnam War and plotting to spread the flames of war to the entire Indochina Peninsula to salvage their failing situation. This does not indicate the strength of U.S. imperialism; on the contrary, it is a clear sign of their desperation and the exposure of their paper tiger's weakness.

Recently, American bourgeois newspapers, while advocating the expansion of the war on behalf of the Johnson administration, have had to admit that U.S. imperialism is facing numerous difficulties in the Vietnam War. The *Saturday Evening Post* reported: Johnson is eager to "resolve" the Vietnam issue before the 1968 U.S. elections, but now he is increasingly "unable to see the end of the war."

Increasing Casualties, Insufficient Troops

Since 1965, U.S. imperialism has been escalating its military aggression in South Vietnam, launching large-scale invasions. As the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam increased, so did their casualty figures: 19,200 in 1965; 100,800 in 1966. The first quarter of this year saw a 40% increase in casualties compared to the same period last year. Agence France-Presse, based on the casualty figures released by the U.S. Department of Defense, predicts that U.S. casualties in the Vietnam War may "far exceed" those in the Korean War.

Over the past two years, the Johnson administration, in order to meet the needs of the South Vietnamese battlefield, has not only intensified conscription and expanded the military but has also deployed part of the U.S. strategic reserve to the South Vietnamese battlefield. The Johnson administration has also reached an understanding with the Soviet revisionist leadership to repeatedly withdraw troops from Western Europe and deploy them to the South Vietnamese battlefield, robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Currently, the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam has increased to nearly 450,000. Recently, the U.S. invasion commander, Westmoreland, rushed back to the U.S. to request more troops, demanding an additional 160,000 troops this year. However, American newspapers reported that some experts in the U.S. Department of Defense believe that "there is no easy way to obtain new troops" unless partial mobilization is implemented or troops are withdrawn from Europe. The insatiable imperialist ambitions of U.S. imperialism and the limited number of troops have been completely exposed, to the point where the military preparedness subcommittee of the U.S. Senate questioned the chiefs of staff of the three services, asking, "What if another war like Vietnam breaks out?"

Massive Consumption, Supply Difficulties

The Vietnam War has become a massive war of attrition for U.S. imperialism. Last year, the U.S. spent $60-70 million per day on the Vietnam War. With the increase in U.S. troops in Vietnam, this year's war expenses have already exceeded $100 million per day. Johnson, the head of U.S. imperialism, also admitted that this year's military budget may increase by another $5 billion, which would result in an unprecedented fiscal deficit for the U.S.

U.S. warplanes have dumped tens of thousands of tons of bombs on South and North Vietnam, but such indiscriminate bombing has not only failed to save the U.S. from its losing situation in Vietnam but has also consumed a large number of U.S. aircraft and pilots. By May 17, the U.S. had already lost 1,900 aircraft due to bombing North Vietnam alone. A report by the U.S. Senate military preparedness subcommittee revealed that "the loss of certain types of aircraft in Vietnam has exceeded the production supply." Due to the massive consumption, according to testimony by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers at this committee, "about half of all Marine Corps aircraft squadrons have been transferred to Southeast Asia," and there is a "severe shortage of aircraft pilots in Vietnam." To make up for the losses in the Vietnam War, the number of aircraft squadrons on the seven aircraft carriers of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet has been reduced.

This subcommittee also acknowledged in another investigative report that due to the long distance from the rear, as the Vietnam War continues to escalate, the U.S. will face "extreme difficulties" in supply and transportation. The U.S. authorities have now had to reactivate more than 160 ships that had been idle for many years.

"Pacification" Plans, Repeated Failures

Currently, the South Vietnamese armed forces have liberated four-fifths of the land and three-quarters of the population in South Vietnam, and the U.S.-puppet army is deeply mired in the fires of the people's war, suffering setbacks everywhere. In this situation, while the U.S. invasion forces are busy dealing with the South Vietnamese armed forces, they are driving the South Vietnamese puppet army to "pacify" the countryside, attempting to "stabilize" the rear. However, even American reactionary columnist Stewart Alsop, a proponent of the Vietnam policy, had to admit in despair: The U.S. "has tried many plans to pacify the Vietnamese countryside, but all have failed," and in the vast countryside of South Vietnam, the grassroots organizations of the National Liberation Front are the "real government," and "such grassroots organizations are actually stronger than they were a year ago." The U.S. Senate military preparedness subcommittee also admitted in frustration that the so-called "safe" areas account for only 10.4% of South Vietnam's territory.

The *Christian Science Monitor* reported in early May: Even in the suburbs of Saigon, where six U.S. combat battalions and one puppet army combat battalion are stationed, people do not consider the security situation sufficient to allow "pacification" teams to carry out normal activities without fearing for their lives.

People's Opposition, Internal Strife Intensifies

As the Vietnam War continues to "escalate," anti-war sentiment among the American people is growing, and the failure of the "escalation" has intensified internal disputes within the ruling class.

Since the beginning of this year, anti-war demonstrations and protests by various strata of American society have been on the rise, and the movement of young people refusing to serve in the military has also seen new developments. The large-scale anti-war demonstrations by tens of thousands of people in New York and San Francisco on April 15 pushed the anti-war movement to a new high. This has made the American ruling class very uneasy. The U.S. Information Agency admitted: The American people "do not like this Vietnam War, and the longer it goes on, the less they like it."

Johnson's opponents recently used the Vietnam debacle to attack him again. Some "opposition" within his own Democratic Party have had a falling out with him. According to the *Daily Express*, Johnson is "very angry" because the number of people opposing him is increasing. At a banquet, he "almost cried" while talking about the Vietnam War to 700 guests.

Internationally, U.S. imperialism is also isolated and without support, becoming increasingly isolated.

Dark Future, Wailing Everywhere

Facing enormous difficulties and failures, some American bourgeois newspapers have a gloomy tone when they look ahead to the future of the Vietnam War. The May 8 issue of *U.S. News & World Report* magazine reported the words of a retired general: The Vietnam War "is a very annoying thing," and the U.S. has lost the "significant advantages in combat" possessed by its military organization and equipment and the "strategic initiative." American bourgeois commentator Walter Lippmann wrote in the *New York Herald Tribune*: "Johnson is now in a difficult position," and "it seems that the scale of this war in terms of personnel, money, and casualties will be limitless."

So, what is the way out? The May 1 issue of *U.S. News & World Report* magazine wrote: "'Gradual response' (referring to 'gradual escalation') as a strategy has proven to be a complete failure. 'Reaching a deal'—the goal of President Johnson—is simply not in sight, not even a hint of it."

### 美帝在侵越战争中困难重重走投无路

    美帝在侵越战争中困难重重走投无路
    美帝国主义正在疯狂扩大侵越战争，并且阴谋把战火扩大到整个印度支那，来挽救它的败局。这绝不表明美帝国主义的强大，恰恰相反，这正是它走投无路的表现，是它纸老虎的虚弱本质的大暴露。
    美国资产阶级报刊最近在替约翰逊政府鼓吹扩大战争的同时，不得不承认美帝国主义在侵越战争中面临着重重困难。《星期六晚邮报》说：约翰逊急于在一九六八年美国大选前“解决”越南问题，但是，他现在却越来越“看不到战争的尽头”。
    伤亡激增，兵力不足
    美帝国主义从一九六五年开始对南越大举增兵，发起了大规模军事侵略。随着侵越美军的增加，他们的伤亡数字也直线上升：一九六五年的伤亡人数是一万九千二百人；一九六六年即猛烈上升到十万零八千人。今年第一季度的伤亡比去年同期又增加了百分之四十以上。法新社根据美国国防部公布的伤亡数字，预计美军在侵越战争中的伤亡，可能“大大超过”侵朝战争。
    两年多来，约翰逊政府为了满足南越战场上的需要，除了加紧征兵，大肆扩军而外，把美国的一部分战略后备队也投入了南越战场。约翰逊政府还同苏修领导集团取得默契，一再从西欧抽调兵力投入南越战场，拆西墙补东墙。
    现在，侵越美军已增加到近四十五万人。最近，美国侵略军司令威斯特摩兰又赶回美国去讨救兵，要求在今年内再增兵十六万人。但是，美国报纸报道说，美国国防部的一些专家认为，除非实行部分动员或者从欧洲抽调部队，否则“没有获得新军队的轻而易举的办法”。美帝国主义无限的侵略野心，同它有限的兵力之间的矛盾，彻底暴露，以致美国参议院的军备小组委员会质问三军参谋长说，如果再发生一场象越南一样的战争，美国怎么办？
    损耗巨大，供应困难
    侵越战争对美帝国主义来说，已经成为一场巨大的消耗战。去年美国为侵越战争每天花费六千万到七千万美元。随着侵越美军的增加，今年的战费每天已经超过一亿美元。美帝国主义头子约翰逊也承认，今年军费可能还要增加五十亿美元。这样就会使美国出现空前巨大的财政赤字。
    美国强盗飞机对越南南方和北方倾泻了数以十万吨计的炸弹，但是，这种狂轰滥炸根本挽救不了美国在越南战场的败局，反而消耗了大量美国飞机和驾驶员。到五月十七日止，美国单是由于轰炸越南北方而损失的飞机，就已经达到一千九百架。美国参议院军备小组委员会的一个报告透露，“在越南的某些种类的飞机的损失超过了生产所能供应的数量”。
    由于损耗巨大，据美国海军和海军陆战队军官在这个委员会作证时透露，“所有海军陆战队飞机中队中，约有一半已转移到东南亚地区”，在“越南严重缺乏飞机驾驶员”。为了补充越南战争的损耗，美国驻大西洋舰队的“七艘航空母舰上的飞机中队的数目减少了”。
    这个小组委员会在另一项调查报告中还承认，由于同后方的距离太远，随着侵越战争的进一步扩大，美国在供应、运输方面的困难将“紧张到极点”。美国当局现在不得不重新启用一百六十多艘已经闲置多年的船只。
    “绥靖”计划，连遭破产
    目前，南越人民武装已经解放了越南南方五分之四的土地、四分之三的人口，美伪军深陷在人民战争的火海中，到处挨烧。在这种情况下，美国侵略军在疲于奔命地应付南越人民武装的同时，驱使南越伪军“绥靖”农村，企图“稳定”后方。但是，连美国反动专栏作家斯·艾尔索普这样的侵越政策吹鼓手也不得不沮丧地承认：美国“曾试行过许多绥靖越南农村的计划，但是都失败了”，在南越广大农村，南越民族解放阵线的基层机构是“真正的政府”，而且，“这种基层机构实际上比一年前来得强大”。美国参议院军备小组委员会也懊丧地承认，所谓“安全”的地区只占南越面积的百分之十点四。
    美国《基督教科学箴言报》在五月初报道说：甚至在驻着六个美国战斗营和一个伪军战斗营的西贡郊区，人们认为安全情况也不足以使“绥靖”小组从事正常活动而不必担心自己的生命危险。
    人民反对，内讧加剧
    随着侵越战争的不断“升级”，美国人民的反战情绪日益高涨，同时，战争“升级”的失败又使统治集团内部的争吵趋于激化。
    今年以来，美国各阶层人民反对侵越战争的示威抗议行动此伏彼起，青年拒服兵役的运动也有新的发展。四月十五日纽约和旧金山数十万人的大规模反战示威，使反战运动进入了新的高潮。这使美国统治集团十分不安。美新处承认：美国人民“不喜欢这场越南战争，而且随着这场战争的打下去越来越不喜欢它”。
    约翰逊的政敌最近再次利用侵越败局对约翰逊发起了攻击。约翰逊自己的民主党内的一些“反对派”同他吵得不可开交。据英国《每日快报》报道，约翰逊因为反对他的人越来越多，非常“恼火”。在一次宴会上，他“在向七百名客人谈到越南战争时几乎要哭了”。
    在国际上，美帝国主义也是失道寡助，越来越孤立。
    前途暗淡，一片悲鸣
    面对着巨大的困难和失败，一些美国资产阶级报刊展望侵越前途时，语调低沉，忧心忡忡。五月八日一期的《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志报道一个退休将军的话说，越南战争“是一件非常恼人的事情”，美国丧失了“军事组织和装备所拥有的在战斗上的重大有利条件”和“战略主动权”。美国资产阶级评论家李普曼在《纽约先驱论坛报》上写道：“约翰逊现在是骑虎难下”，“看来这场战争在人员、金钱和伤亡方面的规模都将无限地扩大”。
    那末，出路何在呢？五月一日的一期《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志写道：“‘逐步反应’（按：指“逐步升级”）作为一种战略证明是彻底失败了。‘达成交易’——约翰逊总统的目标——简直看不到，甚至连暗示也没有。”
