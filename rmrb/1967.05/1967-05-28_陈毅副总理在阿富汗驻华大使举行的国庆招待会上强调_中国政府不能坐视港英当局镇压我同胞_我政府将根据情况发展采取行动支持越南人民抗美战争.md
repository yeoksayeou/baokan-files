Vice Premier Chen Yi today strongly condemned the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong for their savage suppression of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. He emphasized, "The British government not only ignores the Chinese government's protests and serious demands, but also intensifies its savage suppression. The Chinese government and people cannot stand idly by and do nothing about this." He reiterated that the British government must immediately accept the Chinese government's five demands and stop the suppression of Chinese residents in Hong Kong. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this must be borne by the British government.

Vice Premier Chen Yi made these strong condemnations at a reception held by the Afghan Ambassador to China, Suhail, to celebrate Afghanistan's 49th anniversary of independence.

Attending the reception were also Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and other responsible officials from relevant departments.

Ambassador Suhail spoke first at the reception. He talked about Afghanistan's national construction and its policy of neutrality and non-alignment. He said, "The Afghan people and the Chinese people have had friendship for centuries. We have discussed all issues in a friendly manner and respect each other's views. We wish the friendship between the Afghan people and the Chinese people to last forever."

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi praised the friendship between China and Afghanistan and their peoples. He said, "The continuous development of friendly relations between our two countries is in the interests of the peoples of both countries. We are confident that, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, through the joint efforts of both sides, the friendship between China and Afghanistan will achieve new developments."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "Recently, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have savagely suppressed our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and strongly protest against the British government's suppression of Chinese residents in Hong Kong. The British government must immediately accept the Chinese government's five demands and stop the suppression of Chinese residents in Hong Kong. Otherwise, the British government must bear all serious consequences arising from this."

Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The Chinese government and people are closely watching the developments in Vietnam. The U.S. imperialists are in their death throes, not only continuously bombing Hanoi but also brazenly attacking the demilitarized zone. The Chinese government and people will take all necessary actions based on the developments and fully support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression. We are not afraid to take risks, nor are we afraid to pay any price, and we will definitely make our contribution together with the heroic Vietnamese people to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors."

Vice Premier Chen Yi strongly condemned the collusion of U.S. imperialism and British imperialism with modern revisionism, using Israel to inflict heavy disasters on the Palestinian people, and conducting armed aggression and subversive activities against Syria and other Arab countries. He said, "The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the Palestinian people and firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of the Arab countries against the aggression of U.S. and British imperialism and their tool, Israel."

In discussing China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The victory of this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution guarantees that our socialist revolution will be carried through to the end and that our country will be able to better support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world."

He pointed out, "Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are extremely afraid of and hate our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They constantly shout anti-China slogans and everywhere stir up hysterical anti-China activities. They try to sow discord between friendly countries and China and attempt to isolate China and resist great Mao Zedong Thought by uniting to oppose China. This is a futile attempt. Any attempt to stop the Chinese people from advancing to victory is doomed to fail."

Diplomats from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    中国政府不能坐视港英当局镇压我同胞
    我政府将根据情况发展采取行动支持越南人民抗美战争
    新华社二十七日讯  陈毅副总理今天强烈谴责英国政府和香港英国当局对我香港爱国同胞进行的疯狂镇压。他强调指出：“英国政府不但不顾中国政府的抗议和严正要求，反而变本加厉地继续进行疯狂镇压。中国政府和中国人民，对此绝对不能坐视不管。”他重申英国政府必须立即接受中国政府的五项要求，停止对香港中国居民的镇压。否则，由此产生的一切严重后果，必须由英国政府承担。
    陈毅副总理是在阿富汗驻中国大使苏海尔为庆祝阿富汗独立四十九周年而举行的招待会上，向英国政府和香港英国当局提出上述强烈谴责的。
    出席招待会的还有人大常委会副委员长郭沫若以及各有关方面负责人。
    苏海尔大使在招待会上首先讲话。他谈到了阿富汗建设国家的情况和奉行的中立和不结盟政策。他说，阿富汗人民和中国人民多少世纪以来就存在着友谊。我们友好地讨论了所有的问题，并互相尊重两国的看法。我们祝愿阿富汗人民和中国人民之间的友谊万古常青。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中，赞扬了中国和阿富汗两国和两国人民的友谊。他说，我们两国友好关系的不断发展，是符合两国人民的利益的。我们深信，在和平共处五项原则的基础上，通过双方的共同努力，中阿友好关系必将获得新的发展。
    陈毅副总理说，最近，英国政府和香港英国当局，对我香港爱国同胞进行了疯狂镇压。中国政府和中国人民坚决支持香港爱国同胞的正义斗争，坚决抗议英国政府对香港中国居民的镇压暴行。英国政府必须立即接受中国政府的五项要求，停止对香港中国居民的镇压。否则，英国政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
    陈毅副总理说，中国政府和中国人民正在密切注视越南局势的发展。美帝国主义正在垂死挣扎，不仅连续轰炸河内，而且还悍然进犯非军事区。中国政府和中国人民将根据情况的发展，采取一切必要的行动，全力支持越南人民的抗美救国战争。我们决不怕承担风险，也决不怕付出任何代价，一定要同英雄的越南人民一道，为彻底打败美国侵略者作出自己的贡献。
    陈毅副总理强烈谴责美帝国主义和英帝国主义勾结现代修正主义，利用以色列给巴勒斯坦制造沉重的灾难，并且对叙利亚等阿拉伯国家进行武装侵略和颠覆活动。他说，中国人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民反对美英帝国主义及其工具以色列侵略的正义斗争。
    陈毅副总理在谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时说，这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，保证我国的社会主义革命进行到底，保证我国能够更好地支援全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的革命斗争。
    他指出，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对我国的无产阶级文化大革命，非常害怕，万分痛恨。它们不断地叫嚣反华，到处掀起歇斯底里的反华活动。它们竭力挑拨友好国家同我国的关系，并且企图用联合反华的办法来孤立中国、抵制伟大的毛泽东思想。这是痴心妄想，任何阻止中国人民胜利前进的企图，都是一定要失败的。
    各国驻中国使节也出席了招待会。
