	Capital's People from Various Circles Support Telegram

	Xinhua News Agency, May 25th - Telegram of Support from the Capital's People from Various Circles for the Struggle of the Palestinian and Arab Peoples Against U.S. Imperialism and Its Aggressive Tool, Israel

	We, the people of various circles in the capital of the People's Republic of China, today solemnly gather to commemorate "Palestine Day" and resolutely support the just struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples against U.S. imperialism and its aggressive tool, Israel.

	The Palestinian issue was manufactured by the U.S. and British imperialists through the United Nations. Israel is a dagger they have plunged into the heart of the Arab world. For nineteen years, U.S. imperialism has obstructed the return of over a million Palestinian Arabs to their homeland. It instigates Israel to repeatedly launch armed invasions against Arab countries, while on the other hand, under the guise of "aid" and "friendship," it directly infiltrates various Arab countries, attempting to establish its neo-colonial rule in the Middle East. The Palestinian people have long suffered disasters, and the independence and sovereignty of various Arab countries are frequently threatened. The root cause of this is U.S. imperialism. Facts have proven that U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Palestinian people and the peoples of various Arab countries.

	The chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, has always colluded with Israel, playing along with U.S. imperialism in the Palestinian issue, peddling the so-called "Tashkent spirit" to resolve the disputes between Israel and Arab countries, attempting to deprive the Palestinian people of their sacred right to liberate their homeland, and forcing the Palestinian and Arab peoples to abandon their struggle and acknowledge the status quo of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. Therefore, to effectively oppose U.S. imperialism and its tool Israel, we must also oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	Recently, U.S. imperialism has instigated Israel to mobilize troops along the border, and the U.S. Sixth Fleet is stirring, seriously threatening the security of the peoples of Syria, the United Arab Republic, and various Arab countries. The Soviet revisionist leadership has once again attempted to act as a firefighter to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist revolution, advising Arab countries to adopt "cautious" and "restrained" attitudes. However, the peoples of Syria, the United Arab Republic, and various Arab countries, with their glorious anti-imperialist traditions, have already mobilized urgently and are ready to give a crushing blow to any invading aggressors.

	U.S. imperialism, Israeli Zionism, and Soviet revisionism are all paper tigers. No matter what tricks they play, they cannot extinguish the flames of struggle of the Palestinian and Arab peoples. Currently, the Palestinian people are full of fighting spirit, increasingly recognizing the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," and are determined to take the path of armed struggle. Throughout the Arab region, from the shores of the Red Sea to the Mediterranean coast, anti-U.S. struggles are surging, powerfully striking at the imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States, and making important contributions to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism of the Asian and African peoples.

	The Chinese people firmly support the armed struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate their homeland and return to their homes; firmly stand on the side of the peoples of various Arab countries, fully supporting their just struggle against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and Israel. Currently, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is being successfully carried out in China, inspiring the Chinese people to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and more powerfully support all oppressed nations and peoples. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." We believe that the Palestinian and Arab peoples, by strengthening their unity and persevering in their struggle, will definitely be able to frustrate the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

	U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated, the Palestinian people will surely be victorious, and the peoples of various Arab countries will surely be victorious.

    首都各界大会支持电
    新华社二十五日讯　首都各界人民支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列斗争大会支持电
    我们——中华人民共和国首都各界人民今天隆重集会，纪念“巴勒斯坦日”，并坚决支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的正义斗争。
    巴勒斯坦问题是美英帝国主义者操纵联合国一手制造的，以色列就是它们插在阿拉伯心脏的一把尖刀。十九年来，美帝国主义一直阻挠一百多万巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人重返家园。它唆使以色列一再向阿拉伯国家进行武装侵略；另一方面又打着“援助”和“友谊”的幌子，直接渗入阿拉伯各国，妄图在中东地区建立其新殖民主义统治。巴勒斯坦人民长期遭受灾难，阿拉伯各国的独立与主权经常受到威胁，其祸根就是美帝国主义。事实证明，美帝国主义是巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯各国人民的死敌。
    美帝的头号帮凶苏联修正主义领导集团一直同以色列勾勾搭搭，在巴勒斯坦问题上配合美帝玩弄所谓“和解”的阴谋，大肆鼓吹用“塔什干精神”来解决以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的争端，企图剥夺巴勒斯坦人民解放自己家园的神圣权利，强迫巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民放弃斗争，承认以色列霸占巴勒斯坦国土的现状。因此，要有效地反对美帝及其工具以色列，同时，必须反对苏修领导集团。
    最近，美帝国主义竟又唆使以色列陈兵边境，美国第六舰队蠢蠢欲动，严重地威胁着叙利亚、阿联和阿拉伯各国人民的安全。苏联修正主义领导集团再一次企图充当扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝革命烈火的消防队员，劝说阿拉伯国家采取“慎重”和“克制”的态度。但是具有反帝光荣传统的叙利亚、阿联和阿拉伯各国人民已经紧急动员起来，严阵以待，随时准备给敢于来犯的侵略者以迎头痛击。
    美帝国主义、以色列犹太复国主义和苏联修正主义都是纸老虎。不管他们施展什么阴谋，都无法扑灭巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民的斗争烈火。现在，巴勒斯坦人民斗志昂扬，日益认识到“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理，决心走武装斗争的道路。在整个阿拉伯地区，从红海之滨到地中海畔，反美斗争不断高涨，有力地打击着以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，对亚非人民的团结反帝事业作出了重要贡献。
    中国人民坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民解放国土和重返家园的武装斗争；坚决站在阿拉伯各国人民的一边，全力支持他们反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略的正义斗争。当前，正在中国胜利开展的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，鼓舞着中国人民更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更有力地支援一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”我们相信，巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯各国人民加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够挫败美帝及其走狗的侵略。
    美帝国主义必败，巴勒斯坦人民必胜，阿拉伯各国人民必胜。
    中华人民共和国首都各界人民支持巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列斗争大会
