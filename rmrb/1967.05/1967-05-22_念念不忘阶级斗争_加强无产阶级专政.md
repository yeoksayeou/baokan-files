The proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad masses of the people in Guizhou Province and Guiyang City are jubilant after the publication of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Notice" and the article "A Great Historical Document" by the editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*. They are studying these two important documents earnestly and, in light of the current situation and the experience of the past year, are further arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. They are deeply engaged in the struggle against the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Below are excerpts from the speeches of some comrades from the proletarian revolutionary masses in Guizhou Province and Guiyang City during their study of the "Notice."

Li Zaichan, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Guizhou Province, said: During the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, whether or not to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat is a major principle that Marxists-Leninists and revisionists have debated.

Marxists-Leninists have always believed that the dictatorship of the proletariat must be strengthened; while revisionists oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, turning it into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, into fascist dictatorship. Our great leader Chairman Mao has greatly enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat on this fundamental issue. In 1949, when the Chinese revolution had just achieved nationwide victory, Chairman Mao made the most brilliant judgment on this issue in his brilliant work "On People's Democratic Dictatorship." Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism still exists, domestic reactionaries still exist, domestic classes still exist. Our current task is to strengthen the state machine of the people, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to consolidate national defense and protect the interests of the people. With this as a condition, China can, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, steadily transition from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society, eliminate classes, and achieve great harmony." Chairman Mao here tells us several basic points: that in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, classes and class struggle still exist, and therefore the state machine must be strengthened and the dictatorship of the proletariat must be strengthened. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, it would be impossible to steadily carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and it would be impossible to transition to a communist society. The practice of the past 17 years since national liberation, especially the practice since the launch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has fully proven that Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment is an unshakable truth. The practice of the past 17 years has proven that all class enemies at home and abroad, as well as the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have launched a frenzied attack on the Party, on socialism, and on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, ultimately aiming to seize power from the proletariat. They use every means to try to abolish and weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat, to achieve a capitalist restoration. While the Marxists-Leninists led by Chairman Mao use every means to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao aims to solve the core issue of seizing back from the hands of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists the power over the Party, government, economy, culture, and other areas, and to ensure the continuation of socialist revolution and socialist construction under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, gradually transitioning to communism. Therefore, the "Notice" personally drafted and issued by Chairman Mao is the beacon for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the beacon for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the beacon for ensuring the transition from socialism to communism.

Xin Keping, a responsible comrade of the Revolutionary Committee of the Political Department of the Industrial and Transportation Sector of Guizhou Province, said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has established immeasurable merits for the Chinese and world revolution. Now, this cultural revolution has achieved great victories. This victory will have an extremely profound impact on consolidating our country's dictatorship of the proletariat, ensuring our country's advancement along the path of socialism and communism, and promoting the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of the world.

However, as Chairman Mao has often instructed us in recent years, the victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. Therefore, we must not think that after this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the issue of the bourgeoisie's struggle for power with us is completely resolved, and that the world will be peaceful from now on. We must see that the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is at a crucial moment of decisive battle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and we must see the long-term and complex nature of class struggle, thereby always maintaining a sober mind and always heightening our class vigilance.

Right after we seized national power, Chairman Mao timely and clearly told us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat, and they will make their last struggle. After national pacification, they will also engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, attempting to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, beyond doubt, and we must never relax our vigilance."

Through the practice of various revolutionary struggles since national liberation, especially the practice of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel how brilliant and correct Chairman Mao's judgment is! In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have exposed a batch of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated our hearts, especially the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, which is a great victory. However, it would be impossible to imagine that in the future, there will no longer be representatives of the bourgeoisie infiltrating our Party, government, military, and various cultural fields, seizing leadership from within to carry out a capitalist restoration. If we view the problem in this way, we are politically confused and will inevitably make big mistakes.

We must clearly see that throughout the entire socialist period, there is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a struggle between socialism and capitalism. The overthrown bourgeoisie will inevitably continue to use the methods of being pulled out and breaking in, corrupting us, and disintegrating us. If we do not have sufficient awareness of this and do not constantly pay attention to purging the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated from within, it is possible that a capitalist restoration could happen at any time. Therefore, we must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, always maintain revolutionary vigilance. At present, we should firmly grasp the main contradiction, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and fight down, fight over, and fight against the influence of the small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The more thorough this struggle is, the more beneficial it will be for us to continue to eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology and cultivate new people with communist ideals in the future. We believe that under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely achieve complete victory in the cultural revolution!

Wang Deqin and Li Mingfu of the editorial department of the *June 6 Battle Report* of Guiyang Normal College said: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao further developed Marxism-Leninism, solving the theoretical and practical issues of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration.

In the course of the movement, Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed us that the main target of this movement is the small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Unite with the majority and mercilessly strike down the minority; this is the direction of the movement. We have deep feelings about this in the practice of the struggle.

Who are the ones trying to lead us onto the capitalist road? They are the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as the small group of power-holders in various departments who are taking the capitalist road.

Look at how the small group of power-holders within our college who are taking the capitalist road, under the guidance of the reactionary ideology of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have led the broad masses of teachers and students astray. They abolished Chairman Mao's six political criteria for distinguishing between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds and encouraged different schools of thought and academic views to "freely express and freely discuss." Because of this, some teachers in the classroom, in so-called "academic" lectures, and in academic journals have spread a large amount of feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist goods; some even openly engaged in reactionary propaganda. In a calligraphy exhibition held by the Chinese Department, the handwriting of the executioner of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement, Zeng Guofan, and the national thief Yuan Shikai were even displayed. Such serious political issues were said by those power-holders in our college who are taking the capitalist road to be "academic" issues, issues of "a hundred schools of thought contending"!

They also opposed Chairman Mao's policy of combining education with productive labor and combining intellectuals with the workers and peasants. They advocated closed-door education, not allowing revolutionary teachers and students to go to the workers and peasants, but keeping the students in the school to dig fish ponds and build gardens, with the aim of "making the school a quiet reading environment," turning the school into a secluded paradise detached from the three great revolutionary movements and society. In this way, they led the broad masses of teachers and students onto the capitalist road of not asking about politics, being red but not expert, and pursuing fame and wealth; some students and teachers of worker-peasant origin also became victims of feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist ideology under the influence of this revisionist educational line. Their actions are not destroying the socialist system and carrying out a capitalist restoration?

Chairman Mao teaches us that the main target of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. To thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, we must, in the current cultural revolution, follow Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and concentrate our firepower to mercilessly strike down the small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly grasp this direction of the struggle. At present, it means strictly distinguishing and correctly handling two types of contradictions of different natures; daring to liberate the majority and mercilessly strike down the minority; to hold high the banner of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and through the criticism of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination," thereby doing a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit.

Li Beixi, a worker from Guiyang Cotton Mill and a standing committee member of the Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang City, said: The "Notice" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is the beacon for our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It shines brightly, illuminating our way forward and adding strength to our struggle.

Our beloved leader Chairman Mao said: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." We proletarian revolutionaries listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we will definitely, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, distinguish between our enemies and our friends, pay attention to uniting with the majority, and mercilessly strike down the minority, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle.

The small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are most afraid of us grasping the direction of the struggle. They always spread cold winds and light ghost fires, trying to muddy the waters and fish in the mud, making us proletarian revolutionaries grasp minor issues in the struggle and miss the main target. In the early stages of the movement, they hastily dispatched "work teams" to implement white terror, directing the spearhead of the struggle at the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, plotting to protect their "minority." After the trick of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road was smashed, they blew a black wind of economism, using sugar-coated bullets to attack us, trying to lead our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this serious political struggle, astray, changing the direction of the struggle. Why do they always try to muddy our direction of struggle? Because we concentrate our forces to strike down the small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they can no longer mix in, and on the verge of annihilation, they will inevitably make desperate struggles.

We proletarian revolutionaries grasp the direction of the struggle with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Practice has proven that if we deviate from Mao Zedong Thought by even a little, we will deviate from the direction by a great distance, and may even go against the direction and onto the wrong path. Only by actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the practice of class struggle, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, can we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

Currently, some erroneous thoughts such as small-groupism, factionalism, and anarchism have emerged in some revolutionary factions. Those with such erroneous thoughts are eager to fight "internal wars," confusing the boundaries between proletarian great democracy and bourgeois liberalization, disregarding proletarian revolutionary discipline, disregarding the interests of the Party and the state, denying all authorities, and doing things that make friends sad and enemies happy. This erroneous thought seriously hinders our struggle against the biggest small group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, diverting our direction of struggle. We proletarian revolutionaries must fully realize that firmly grasping the direction of the struggle is a major issue related to whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can achieve a thorough victory, and a major issue related to the future of our Party and state. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    念念不忘阶级斗争　加强无产阶级专政
    贵州无产阶级革命派认真学习《通知》和《伟大的历史文件》，决心掌握斗争大方向，集中力量斗倒斗垮党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    本报贵阳讯　中共中央《通知》和《红旗》杂志编辑部、《人民日报》编辑部的文章《伟大的历史文件》发表之后，贵州省和贵阳市无产阶级革命派和广大人民群众欢欣鼓舞。他们认真学习这两个重要文件，并且结合目前斗争的新形势，结合一年来的斗争的经验，进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来，深入开展对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。下面是贵州省、贵阳市无产阶级革命派部分同志学习《通知》时发表的谈话摘要。
    贵州省革命委员会主任委员李再含说：在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，要不要加强无产阶级专政，这是马克思列宁主义者同修正主义者争论的一个重大的原则问题。
    马克思列宁主义者从来认为，必须加强无产阶级专政；而修正主义者反对无产阶级专政，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，变为法西斯专政。我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在这个根本问题上，大大丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说。在中国革命刚刚取得全国胜利的一九四九年，毛主席就在《论人民民主专政》这篇光辉著作里，对这个问题作了最英明的论断。毛主席说：“帝国主义还存在，国内反动派还存在，国内阶级还存在。我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队、人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以巩固国防和保护人民利益。以此作为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级和共产党的领导之下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会和共产主义社会，消灭阶级和实现大同。”毛主席在这里告诉了我们这样几个基本观点，就是在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期，还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，因此还要强化国家机器，加强无产阶级专政。没有无产阶级专政，就不可能稳步地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，就不可能过渡到共产主义社会。全国解放十七年来的实践，特别是开展无产阶级文化大革命以来的实践，充分证明了毛主席这个英明论断是颠扑不破的真理。十七年来的实践证明，国内外一切阶级敌人，以及隐藏在党内的最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，他们向党，向社会主义，向战无不胜的毛泽东思想猖狂进攻，最终目的，也就是要从无产阶级手里夺权。他们千方百计地想取消和削弱无产阶级专政，实现资本主义复辟。而以毛主席为代表的马克思列宁主义者，则千方百计地要巩固和加强无产阶级专政。毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，要解决的一个核心问题，也就是要将那些被一小撮反革命修正主义分子所篡夺的党、政、财、文等大权，重新夺回到无产阶级手里，从而保证在毛泽东思想指引下，继续进行社会主义革命，进行社会主义建设，逐步过渡到共产主义。所以说，毛主席亲自主持制定的这个《通知》，是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，是巩固无产阶级专政的指路明灯，是保证社会主义向共产主义过渡的指路明灯。
    贵州省工交政治部革命委员会负责人辛克平说：我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，为中国和世界革命建立了不可估量的丰功伟绩。现在，这一场文化大革命已经取得伟大的胜利。这个胜利对于巩固我国无产阶级专政，对于保证我国沿着社会主义和共产主义道路前进，对于促进世界人民的革命斗争，都将发生极为深远的影响。
    但是，正如毛主席近几年经常教导我们的，革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。因此我们决不能认为，经过这场无产阶级文化大革命，资产阶级同我们争夺政权的问题就完全解决了，天下从此就太平无事了。我们必须看到，当前无产阶级文化大革命正处在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，必须看到阶级斗争的长期性和复杂性，从而经常保持清醒的头脑，经常提高我们的阶级警惕性。
    在我们刚刚夺取全国政权以后，毛主席就及时地明确地告诉我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    经过全国解放以来的历次革命斗争的实践，特别是目前这场无产阶级文化大革命的实践，我们深深地体会到，毛主席的这一论断是何等英明，何等正确啊！在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们把一批钻到我们心脏内的反革命修正主义分子揪出来了，特别是把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派揪出来了，这是极其伟大的胜利。但是决不可能设想，今后再也不会有资产阶级的代表人物钻到我们的党内、政府内、军队内和各个文化领域内，从内部篡夺领导权，搞资本主义复辟了，如果这样看问题，那就是政治上的糊涂人，就必然要犯绝大的错误。
    我们一定要清醒地看到，在整个社会主义阶段，都贯串着无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，都贯串着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。已经被推翻的资产阶级，他们必然要继续采取拉出去和打进来的方法，腐蚀我们，瓦解我们。如果我们对这一点没有足够的认识，不经常注意从我们的内部清除混进来的资产阶级代表人物，弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。因此，我们一定要遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，经常保持革命警惕性。在当前，则应紧紧抓住主要矛盾，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，彻底肃清他们的影响。这场斗争进行得越彻底，对于我们在今后继续清除资产阶级思想影响，培养共产主义新人就越有利。我们相信，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指引下，我们一定能够夺取文化大革命的完全胜利！
    贵阳师范学院《六六战报》编辑部王德钦、李明富说：在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席进一步发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。
    在运动的过程中，毛主席一再教导我们，这场运动的主要对象是那些混进党内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。团结一大片，狠狠打击一小撮，这是运动的大方向。对这一点，我们在斗争的实践中有很深的体会。
    是哪些人要把我们引上资本主义道路呢？是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，以及各个部门内那一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    且看我们学院党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是怎样在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反动思想指导下把广大师生引入歧途的。他们取消了毛主席关于识别香花和毒草的六项政治标准，而鼓励不同学派和不同学术见解“自由发表，自由探讨”。就因为这样，有些教师在课堂上、在所谓的“学术”讲座上和学报上，大量散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的货色；有的人甚至公开进行反动的宣传。在中文系举办的一次书法展览会上，竟然展出了镇压太平天国革命运动的刽子手曾国藩和窃国大盗袁世凯的“墨迹”。这样严重的政治问题竟被我院那些走资本主义道路的当权派说成是“学术”问题，是“百家争鸣”问题！
    他们还反对毛主席制定的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，知识分子同工农群众相结合的方针。他们提倡关门办学，不允许革命师生到工农中去，而把学生关在学校里挖渔塘，修花园，目的是“使学校成为一个幽静的读书环境”，就是把学校办成脱离三大革命运动、脱离社会的世外桃源。就是这样，他们把广大师生引上了不问政治、只专不红、追名逐利的资本主义道路；有些劳动人民出身的同学和教师也在这种修正主义教育路线的影响下，成了封建主义、资本主义和修正主义思想的受害者。他们的所作所为，不是在破坏社会主义制度、搞资本主义复辟又是什么呢？
    毛主席教导我们，无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是混入无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。为了彻底铲除修正主义的根子，我们在当前文化大革命中，一定按照毛主席教导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，集中火力狠狠打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    我们无产阶级革命派要紧紧掌握这个斗争的大方向。在目前来说就是要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾；敢于解放一大片，狠狠打击一小撮；要高举以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的大旗，通过对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判，实现革命的大联合，革命的“三结合”，从而搞好本单位的斗批改。
    贵阳棉纺厂工人、贵阳市革命委员会常委李北嬉说：中共中央《通知》是我们无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，它光焰无际，照亮了我们前进的方向，增添了我们斗争的力量。
    我们敬爱的领袖毛主席说：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话。在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们一定按照毛主席的教导，分清谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，注意团结大多数，狠狠地打击一小撮，牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是最害怕我们掌握斗争大方向的。他们总是放阴风，点鬼火，企图混水摸鱼，叫我们无产阶级革命派在斗争中抓住枝节问题，放过主要目标。运动初期，他们急急忙忙派出“工作组”，实行白色恐怖，把斗争的矛头指向广大革命群众和革命干部，阴谋把他们那“一小撮”保护起来。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派施展的这个诡计被我们粉碎以后，他们又刮起一股经济主义的黑风，用糖衣裹着的炮弹向我们进攻，企图把我们无产阶级文化大革命这场严肃的政治斗争引入歧途，改变斗争的大方向。他们为什么总是千方百计搅乱我们的斗争大方向呢？因为我们集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就使他们再也混不下去了，在将要灭亡的前夕，他们必然要作垂死的挣扎。
    我们无产阶级革命派是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想来掌握斗争大方向的。事实证明，离开毛泽东思想一分，就会远离大方向一丈，甚至还会违背大方向，走到邪路上去。只有在阶级斗争的实践中活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，才能紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。
    目前有些革命派队伍里出现了小团体主义、山头主义、无政府主义等错误思想。有这种错误思想的人，热中于打“内战”，混淆无产阶级大民主和资产阶级自由化的界线，不顾无产阶级的革命纪律，不顾党和国家的利益，否定一切权威，做出使亲者痛仇者快的事情来。这种错误思想严重地妨碍了我们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，转移了我们斗争的大方向。我们无产阶级革命派必须充分认识到，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命能不能取得彻底胜利的大事，是关系到我们党和国家的前途的大事。我们一定要高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
