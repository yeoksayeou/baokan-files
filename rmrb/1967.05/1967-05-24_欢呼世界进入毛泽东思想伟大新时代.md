A grand rally was held in the capital to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"

The capital's cultural and artistic circles, along with representatives from workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres, numbering 16,000, gathered today in the magnificent Great Hall of the People to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This event took place under the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, which was personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and at a time when the world is entering a new historical era under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central and relevant leaders such as Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Dong Biwu, Li Xiannian, Nie Rongzhen, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Jiang Qing, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, Guo Moruo, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Ye Qing, Wu De, and Wang Dongxing, attended the meeting.

The meeting, in a letter of tribute to Chairman Mao, fervently declared: "Dearest Chairman Mao! We pledge to you: We will earnestly study and apply the 'Talks' and all your instructions, thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly criticize the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary 'authorities,' and thoroughly purge all the poisonous influences of the bourgeois reactionary line. At the same time, we will further improve the struggle-criticism-transformation in our units, unite the majority of cadres and masses, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution to the end!"

This meeting, held after the public release of the May 16th Circular by the Central Committee in 1966, is another major event in our country's political life. This meeting is a grand review of the brilliant victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art, and a solemn oath-taking ceremony for achieving greater victories in the Cultural Revolution! At present, as the Cultural Revolution enters its decisive stage and revolutionary masses across the country are uniting to launch a general offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, this meeting of profound political significance and great practical importance will bring immense inspiration and boundless strength to our country's revolutionary literary and artistic workers and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people.

Today, the Great Hall of the People was filled with fervent revolutionary passion, expressing boundless love, admiration, loyalty, and worship for the great leader Chairman Mao. The atmosphere was charged with a strong fighting spirit to thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. In the center of the stage, a giant color portrait of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of all Chinese and revolutionary people around the world, hung high. Ten red flags flanked both sides.

Opposite the stage, two large red banners stretched across the hall: "Revolutionary literary and artistic workers must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, to learn from them and unite with them!" and "Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, and thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art!"

The capital's literary and artistic warriors, along with workers, peasants, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres, as well as revolutionary literary and artistic workers from Shanghai and Shandong who came to Beijing to perform revolutionary model operas, were completely immersed in the joyous celebration of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the epoch-making great document, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They repeatedly read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations and sang "The East Is Red" over and over again.

At 4:10 PM, when our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, along with Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and others ascended the stage, the entire audience stood up, and the hall echoed with thunderous applause and prolonged shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Comrade Jiang Qing, the first vice-chairman of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, presided over the meeting. After the meeting began, the entire audience sang "The Internationale" in unison.

Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the chairman of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, delivered an important speech in the midst of a storm of applause (the full text is on pages one and two).

Chen Boda said, "Now the world is entering a completely new historical era. This is a new era with workers, peasants, and soldiers as masters, and a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner." "Twenty-five years ago, our great teacher Mao Zedong's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' foretold that the new era with workers, peasants, and soldiers as masters would soon arrive in all of China, and similarly, it would arrive in various countries around the world through different processes." "Mao Zedong's great work is a summary of a major debate on the political issue of literature and art twenty-five years ago, and it is a summary of a major debate on the fundamental political issue of whether to affirm or deny workers, peasants, and soldiers in contemporary times."

"This great work is our party's declaration for transforming the party and the world according to the image of the vanguard of the proletariat, solving the worldview problem of all those who want to be proletarian revolutionaries, solving the problem of whether many party members have joined the party in thought after joining it organizationally, and pointing out the bright path for all communists and revolutionaries to unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers." "This great work, while not limited to literary and artistic issues, is a summary of proletarian worldview experiences in literary struggles, the first comprehensive book on solving literary problems in history, a thorough revolution in literature by Marxism-Leninism, and has become the guide and program for the current Cultural Revolution in our country." "In essence, this great work has also become a weapon of thought for the oppressed classes and peoples around the world to engage in political struggles against imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, and a battle cry for revolutionaries in various countries to advance in thought and politics against imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries."

Chen Boda emphasized, "After national liberation, Chairman Mao has always been concerned with the problem of the cultural revolution of the proletariat. Chairman Mao has always linked the struggles of the proletariat on the political, economic, and cultural fronts. Over the past seventeen years, all major issues on the cultural front, starting from the criticism of the treasonous 'The Palace Secret History,' the slave-like 'Wu Xun,' and the idealist 'Research on the Dream of the Red Chamber,' have been raised by Chairman Mao. Now it is very necessary for us to re-study 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' and Chairman Mao's series of combative documents on ideological and literary issues. Chairman Mao's series of documents after national liberation are to remind everyone to eliminate the habits and influences of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, and ultimately, to prevent capitalist restoration and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat."

Chen Boda said, "Marx and Engels established the theory of scientific socialism, Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, solved a series of problems of proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of achieving proletarian dictatorship within a country. Mao Zedong developed Marxism-Leninism, solved a series of problems of contemporary proletarian revolution, and solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under proletarian dictatorship and preventing capitalist restoration. These are three great milestones in the development of Marxism."

In his speech, Chen Boda specially mentioned, "Comrade Jiang Qing has always insisted on and defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art. She is the vanguard. In recent years, she has made great efforts in drama, music, dance, and other aspects, creating a series of revolutionary models, driving the ghosts and monsters off the stage of literature and art, and establishing the heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Many literary and artistic workers, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have become pioneers of the literary revolution with Comrade Jiang Qing."

Following this, Comrade Chen Boda delivered a lengthy speech titled "Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' is the Military Charter of the Proletarian Cultural Army" (the full text is on pages three and four).

Chen Boda, in his speech, recounted the great significance and historical background of the production of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." He said, "In the brilliant treasury of Mao Zedong Thought, 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art' is a brilliant Marxist-Leninist work, the first complete, systematic, and correct charter of the proletarian cultural revolution in revolutionary history, a universal truth applicable to all, and a brilliant document in the history of human culture."

Chen Boda reviewed the sharp class struggles on the cultural front since national liberation. He said, "From the sharp struggles on the cultural front since national liberation, it can be seen that the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art is, in essence, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for restoration and anti-restoration." He also said, "Under the historical conditions of proletarian dictatorship, in the class struggle with the main content of restoration and anti-restoration, the revolutionary cultural army is an important force against capitalist restoration and the spread of revisionism. Defending proletarian dictatorship mainly relies on the people's army with guns in their hands, but the cultural army is also indispensable. The cultural army, like the People's Liberation Army of China, shares the heavy responsibility of defending the great proletarian dictatorship and the great cause of socialism."

Chen Boda pointed out, "Today, anyone who only acknowledges proletarian dictatorship in words but does not acknowledge that, under the historical conditions of proletarian dictatorship, there still exists the struggle of restoration and anti-restoration, the struggle between the proletariat to defend proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, is not a true Marxist."

Chen Boda then, based on the spirit of the "Talks," proposed four opinions on the current fighting tasks, policies, and directions of the literary and artistic circles: First, insist on Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively participate in the revolutionary criticism movement, and fight to defend proletarian dictatorship; second, organize the leftist forces and improve the struggle-criticism-transformation in the units; third, focus on creation, establish models, and firmly establish the new proletarian culture; fourth, carry out mass literary and artistic criticism.

Chen Boda said, "We must, in the movement to criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, thoroughly criticize their literary and artistic direction serving counter-revolutionary revisionism, and firmly establish our literary and artistic direction serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must use Chairman Mao's 'Talks' as a weapon, actively participate in the criticism movement, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers." When discussing the current controversy in the cultural circles about whether to criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art for seventeen years or the bourgeois reactionary line for fifty days in June and July last year, he said, "Criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art for seventeen years can and should be combined with criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line in the Cultural Revolution." "We must criticize both the seventeen-year counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the bourgeois reactionary line that protects this black line in literature and art. The general representative of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the proposer of the bourgeois reactionary line are both the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. The most important task of the current criticism movement is to criticize deeply and thoroughly the general representative of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the proposer of the bourgeois reactionary line—the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. Only in this way can we truly establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art."

Chen Boda concluded, "The enemy will continue to struggle with us for restoration and anti-restoration in the future. The cultural front is at the forefront of class struggle, and the struggle is more complex and arduous. We will encounter new difficulties and obstacles on our forward path, but the wheels of history are irresistible, and the invincible sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon us. No difficulties and obstacles can stop our advance."

The speeches by Comrade Chen Boda and Comrade Chen Boda received enthusiastic applause from the entire audience, who repeatedly raised their arms and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art! Ten thousand years! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

The author of "The Song of Ouyang Hai," the composer of the revolutionary Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Harbor," the performer of the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," and the conductor of the revolutionary symphony "The Battle of Shajiabang," Jin Jingmai, Yu Huiyong, Zhong Runliang, and Chen Rutan, respectively, spoke at the meeting (the full text is on pages five and six).

    首都隆重集会纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年
    欢呼世界进入毛泽东思想伟大新时代
    毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春等同志出席大会江青同志主持大会。陈伯达同志作重要讲话。戚本禹同志发表长篇讲话一万六千多文艺战士和工农兵、革命师生、革命干部代表，决心以《讲话》为指南，把文化大革命进行到底
    新华社二十三日讯　在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大胜利的大好形势下，在全世界正在进入一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的崭新的历史时代，首都文化艺术界和工农兵、革命师生、革命干部代表一万六千余人，今天在雄伟壮丽的人民大会堂举行盛大集会，隆重纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，以及中央和有关方面的其他负责同志周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、董必武、李先念、聂荣臻、谢富治、刘宁一、江青、萧华、杨成武、粟裕、蔡畅、邓颖超、郭沫若、王力、关锋、戚本禹、叶群、吴德、汪东兴等，出席了大会。
    大会在给毛主席的致敬信中热烈表示：“最最敬爱的毛主席！我们向您保证：我们一定认真地学习、运用《讲话》和您的一切指示，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，彻底批判资产阶级反动‘权威’，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的一切流毒；在大批判的同时，进一步搞好本单位的斗批改，团结干部和群众的大多数，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    在中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》公开发表后举行的这次大会，是我国政治生活中的又一重大事件。这次大会，是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线获得辉煌胜利的盛大检阅，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命更大胜利的庄严誓师！当前，在无产阶级文化大革命进入决战阶段，在全国各地的无产阶级革命派正在联合起来，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的关键时刻，这个具有深远政治意义和伟大现实意义的大会，必将给我国革命的文艺工作者和亿万革命人民带来巨大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。
    今天的人民大会堂，洋溢着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限敬仰、无限忠诚、无限崇拜的真挚的革命激情，充满了彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的强烈的战斗气氛。主席台正中，高悬着全中国和全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的巨幅彩色画像，十面红旗簇拥两旁。
    在主席台对面，两幅红色大字标语横贯大厅：“革命文艺工作者，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，向工农兵学习，与工农兵结合！”“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，彻底粉碎反革命修正主义文艺黑线！”参加大会的首都文艺战士和工农兵、革命师生、革命干部代表以及来京演出革命样板戏的上海、山东的革命文艺工作者，完全浸沉在庆祝《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这一划时代的伟大文献发表二十五周年的无限欢腾中，一次又一次地高声朗读毛主席语录，一遍又一遍地歌唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    下午四时十分，当我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青等同志登上主席台时，全场起立，掌声雷动，“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声经久不息，震撼着整个大厅。
    中央文革小组第一副组长江青同志主持大会。大会开始后，全场同声高唱《国际歌》。
    中共中央政治局常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志在热烈的暴风雨般的掌声中，发表了重要讲话（全文见第一、二版）。
    陈伯达说：“现在世界正在进入一个完全崭新的历史时代。这是以工农兵为主人翁的新时代，是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。”“二十五年前，我们伟大导师毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》预示着工农兵为主人翁的新时代，即将在全中国到来，同样，也即将经过不同的历程，在世界各国到来。”“毛泽东同志这篇伟大的著作，是二十五年前以文艺问题为题，实质上是属于政治问题的一次大论战的总结，是围绕着关于肯定工农兵或者否定工农兵这一个当代政治根本问题的一次大论战的总结。”
  “这篇伟大著作，是我们党关于依照无产阶级先锋队的面貌改造党、改造世界的一篇划时代的政治宣言书，解决了一切要作无产阶级革命家的世界观问题，解决了许多共产党员在组织上入了党而思想上是否入党的问题，指出了一切共产党员、一切革命家同工农兵群众相结合的光辉道路。”“这篇伟大著作所涉及的，不限于文艺问题，但它又是用无产阶级的世界观对于文艺斗争经验的总结，是历史上第一次出现的解决文艺问题的百科全书，是马克思列宁主义在文艺方面进行的一个全面的大革命，并且成为当前我国无产阶级文化大革命的指南和纲领。”“这篇伟大著作，在实质上，还成为世界上被压迫阶级、被压迫人民同帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派进行政治大搏斗的思想武器，成为各国革命者在思想上、政治上向帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和反动派进军的号角。”
    陈伯达强调指出：“全国解放以后，毛泽东同志一直关注着无产阶级的文化革命的问题。毛泽东同志一直把无产阶级在政治战线上、经济战线上、文化思想战线上这些方面的斗争联结在一起。十七年来，所有文化思想战线上的重大问题，从批判卖国主义《清宫秘史》、奴隶主义《武训传》、唯心论《红楼梦研究》开始，都是毛泽东同志提出来的。现在我们重新学习《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和毛泽东同志的关于思想、文艺问题的一系列战斗性文件，非常必要。毛泽东同志在全国解放后的这一系列文件，是要大家注意清除资产阶级及其他剥削阶级的习惯势力和影响，而归根到底，就是在于防备资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政。”
    陈伯达说：“马克思和恩格斯创立了科学社会主义的理论，列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，解决了帝国主义时代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题，毛泽东同志发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这是
  马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑。”
    陈伯达在讲话中，特别提到：“江青同志一贯坚持和保卫毛主席的文艺革命路线。她是打头阵的。这几年来，她用最大的努力，在戏剧、音乐、舞蹈各个方面，做了一系列革命的样板，把牛鬼蛇神赶下文艺的舞台，树立了工农兵群众的英雄形象。许多文艺工作者，在毛泽东思想的指引下，同江青同志一起，成为文艺革命披荆斩棘的人。”
    接着，戚本禹同志作了题为《毛主席〈在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话〉是无产阶级文化大军的建军纲领》的长篇讲话（全文见第三、四版）。
    戚本禹在讲话中，叙述了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇光辉著作产生的伟大意义和时代背景。他说：“在光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想的宝库里，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是一部光彩夺目的马克思列宁主义的伟大著作，它是无产阶级革命历史上第一次出现的最完整、最系统、最正确的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，它是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，它是人类文化史上划时代的光辉文献。”
    戚本禹回顾了全国解放后十七年来文化战线上存在的尖锐的阶级斗争。他说：“从全国解放以来文化战线上的尖锐斗争中可以看出，毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线同反革命修正主义文艺黑线所作的斗争，归根到底是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级之间的复辟和反复辟的斗争。”他又说：“在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，以复辟和反复辟斗争为主要内容的阶级斗争中，革命的文化大军是反对资本主义复辟、防止修正主义泛滥的重要力量。保卫无产阶级专政，主要的是依靠手里拿枪的人民军队，但是文化大军也是不可缺少的。文化大军同中国人民解放军同样肩负着保卫伟大的无产阶级专政，保卫伟大的社会主义事业的重任。”
    戚本禹指出：“在今天，谁要是仅仅在口头上承认无产阶级专政，而不承认在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，还存在着复辟和反复辟的斗争，存在着无产阶级为保卫无产阶级专政、资产阶级为推翻无产阶级专政而进行的斗争，那他就不是一个真正的马克思主义者。”
    戚本禹接着根据《讲话》精神，对文艺界当前的战斗任务和方针、政策，提出了四个方面的意见：第一，坚持毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，积极参加革命的大批判运动，为保卫无产阶级专政而战斗；第二，组织左派队伍，搞好本单位的斗批改；第三，抓创作，树样板，大立无产阶级之新；第四，开展群众性的文艺批评。
    戚本禹说：“我们要在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开展大批判的运动中，大破他们的为反革命修正主义服务的文艺方向，大立我们的为工农兵服务的文艺方向，我们要以毛主席的《讲话》为武器，积极参加大批判运动，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义的江山。”在谈到现在文化界有所谓究竟是批判十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，还是批判去年六七月间五十多天的资产阶级反动路线的争论时，他说：“批判十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，同批判无产阶级文化大革命中的资产阶级反动路线是应该而且完全可以结合起来的。”“我们既要批判十七年来的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，也要批判保护这条文艺黑线的资产阶级反动路线。反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总代表和资产阶级反动路线的提出者，都是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。当前大批判运动最重要的任务就是要把这个反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总代表和资产阶级反动路线的提出者——党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派批深、批透。只有这样，才能真正树立毛主席的革命文艺路线。”
    戚本禹最后说：“敌人在今后仍然要同我们进行复辟和反复辟的斗争。文化阵地处于阶级斗争的前线，斗争更为复杂和艰巨，我们在前进的道路上，还会遇到新的困难和阻力，但是，历史前进的车轮是不可抗拒的，威力无穷的毛泽东思想的阳光照耀着我们，任何困难和阻力都挡不住我们前进的步伐。”
    陈伯达同志和戚本禹同志的讲话，获得全场热烈的掌声，大家一次又一次地振臂高呼：“毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    《欧阳海之歌》的作者金敬迈，革命京剧《智取威虎山》《海港》的作曲者于会咏、革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》演员钟润良和革命交响音乐《沙家浜》的指挥陈汝棠，先后在大会上发了言（全文见第五、六版）。
