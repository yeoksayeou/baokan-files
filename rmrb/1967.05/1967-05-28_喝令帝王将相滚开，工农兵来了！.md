Revolutionary modern Peking opera has made workers, peasants, and soldiers the masters of the Peking opera stage. We, the Red Guards who have never been interested in Peking opera, have suddenly become its enthusiasts. The great victory of Peking opera reform proves: Revolutionary modern Peking opera is excellent, it is the best!

Revolutionary modern Peking opera is excellent in every way, but the best thing is: The heroic images of the proletarian revolution, armed with the great thought of Chairman Mao, have taken the stage of Peking opera art. Yang Zhenrong in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is such a stirring and towering revolutionary hero.

On the old Peking opera stage, there have always been figures like Zhao Zilong and Huang Tianbao, who were hailed as invincible heroes. But these were merely heroes of the feudal dynasties and the landlord class. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "History is created by the people," and "The masses are the real heroes." The Chinese proletariat and its vanguard have long since taken the political stage and driven imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism out of the political arena. "All the past heroes are gone, and the heroes of today are here." The heroic images of the proletarian revolution in the great Mao Zedong era are the natural masters of today's socialist Peking opera stage!

Look, the heroic image of our era, of our proletariat—Yang Zhenrong, stands tall and proud on the Peking opera stage. This revolutionary soldier from a family of hired laborers, whose parents were killed by the landlord, harbors deep hatred for the class enemy. Comrade Lin Biao said, "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." This exploitation is the exploitation of class by class. Our Yang Zhenrong did not just see the exploitation and oppression of himself and his family. In the deep mountains, the hunter's daughter, Changbao, recounted the bitter history of how the Tiger Mountain bandits killed her grandmother and mother, forcing her to disguise herself as a mute. Yang Zhenrong listened with great indignation, "Every word is blood, every sound is tears, stirring my heart with hatred." In the great furnace of class struggle, he understood that "all oppressed people around the world have a book of blood and tears," and he vowed to "uproot the source of exploitation" and "smash the thousand-year chains to open the fountain of happiness for all generations." What a noble and heroic ambition!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and works thoroughly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The proletariat not only liberates itself but also liberates all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself." Yang Zhenrong has integrated the highest directives into his blood and put them into action. He takes it upon himself to liberate all oppressed people around the world, leaving behind his already liberated beautiful hometown, and engages in fierce battles with bandits in the vast forests and snowy plains. Although he is in the Northeast revolutionary base area, his eyes are on the entire China shrouded in dark clouds and even the whole world. "I wish the red flag would fly over the five continents and four seas, even if it means facing a sea of fire and a mountain of knives. I cannot wait for the flying snow to melt into spring water, welcoming spring to change the world." In the great storms and trials of class struggle, this "battle-hardened, life-and-death tested, many-times-decorated" Communist Party member has established a thorough and complete dedication to the people, and a communist worldview of selflessness and dedication to the revolution. In the face of such a revolutionary hero armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, those so-called "heroes and chivalrous figures" on the old Peking opera stage, who only served a handful of parasitic exploiters, are they not all reduced to a handful of yellow earth at the foot of Mount Tai!

The proletarian revolutionary heroes fighting for the great ideal of communism are truly fearless, resourceful, and invincible warriors. Look, Yang Zhenrong enters the tiger's den alone, fighting in the heart of the enemy. He encounters a group of ferocious bandits, treating them like a few buzzing flies, not bothering to look at them. He strides confidently into the Tiger Hall, facing the menacing bandit chief, Seatiger, and his Eight Golden Guards. He cleverly exploits the enemy's psychology, skillfully fabricating the story of obtaining the contact map, turning Seatiger's sternness into flattery, and himself from passive to active. He sees through Seatiger's cunning trick of fabricating the sound of our army's attack, turning it into a trap, leading the bandits to practice pursuit, dispelling the enemy's suspicions and timely sending out intelligence. In the unexpected fierce battle of wits with Lan Ping, Yang Zhenrong not only defeats this cunning bandit but also makes the old and cunning, deceitful Seatiger fall completely into Yang Zhenrong's trap.

Where does Yang Zhenrong get such great courage and wisdom, such great skills? From the Party, from the people, from the invincible thought of Mao Zedong! He knows well that "the Party gives me wisdom and courage." He seeks neither fame nor wealth, dedicating himself entirely to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat, so he fears nothing, completely disregarding his personal safety, "knowing the journey is fraught with danger, the more dangerous it is, the more I press on."

In the face of such a great and brave proletarian hero like Yang Zhenrong, those so-called "heroes and chivalrous figures" on the old Peking opera stage, who are completely detached from the people and outwardly strong but inwardly weak, are they not all like sparrows under the eagle, toads behind the galloping horse!

Yang Zhenrong is just one of the countless revolutionary heroes of our era. The proletarian revolutionary cause aims to eliminate all exploiting classes and all exploiting systems, to completely transform the old society. In this unprecedented great cause, under the nurturing of the great thought of Mao Zedong, countless revolutionary heroes who "dare to change the heavens and earth" have emerged from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Chairman Mao said in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Today, we workers, peasants, and soldiers must "use" this Peking opera stage to portray our magnificent heroic deeds and our heroic figures who are worthy of praise and tears. Heroes like Yang Zhenrong, shining brightly, embody the lofty ideals and excellent qualities of the proletariat, and they are the rightful masters of the socialist Peking opera stage! The phenomenon of emperors, generals, officials, talented scholars, and beautiful women, Zhao Zilong, Huang Tianbao, and the like ruling our Peking opera stage must not continue. The Peking opera stage must be returned to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, returned to the proletariat! Order the emperors, generals, and officials to step aside, Yang Zhenrong has arrived! The workers, peasants, and soldiers have arrived!

The proletarian revolutionary heroes taking the Peking opera stage is a great victory of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought! Whether the Peking opera stage should portray proletarian revolutionary heroes is fundamentally a question of whether the great thought of Mao Zedong should occupy the Peking opera stage. We must let the proletarian revolutionary heroes armed with Mao Zedong's thought occupy our Peking opera stage, and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong's thought illuminate the entire Peking opera stage red.

The biggest obstacle to the proletarian revolutionary heroes taking the Peking opera stage is the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. He absurdly says that emperors, generals, officials, talented scholars, and beautiful women "can be sung, and have been sung for so many years, isn't that how we sang out a new China?" Nonsense! His true intentions are clear to all. His real goal is to "sing out" a feudal and capitalist restored old China, to use the Peking opera stage as a battleground for the bourgeoisie to seize our younger generation! He dreams of making our generation kneel before emperors, generals, officials, talented scholars, and beautiful women, disarming us ideologically, and turning us into successors of the bourgeoisie and sacrificial offerings for the restoration of capitalism. This is a pipe dream! We Red Guards listen most to Chairman Mao's words, and we are most eager to learn from proletarian revolutionary heroes like Yang Zhenrong, armed with Mao Zedong's thought. We must be like Yang Zhenrong, loyal and dedicated to the revolution, completely and thoroughly for the people, and vow to be successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause that serves the absolute majority of people in China and the world. We must be like Yang Zhenrong, rolling in the mud of mass movements, smelling the gunpowder of class struggle, tempering our bones, learning real skills, and fighting to the death against all reactionary forces, to open up a bright red new world!

To make more and more proletarian revolutionary heroes take the Peking opera stage and become its permanent masters, we must summon the courage and daring of Yang Zhenrong fighting the tiger, to overthrow the biggest obstacle to the Peking opera revolution and the entire proletarian cultural revolution—the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party—and kick him out of our socialist political stage!

    喝令帝王将相滚开，工农兵来了！
    新北大公社文艺批判战斗团红哨兵
    京剧一演革命现代戏，工农兵英雄形象一成为京剧舞台的主人，我们这些对京剧从来不感兴趣的红卫兵战士，也一下子成了京剧的爱好者。京剧革命的伟大胜利证明：京剧现代戏就是好，好极了！
    革命现代京剧千好万好，最好的就是：用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命英雄形象，登上了京剧艺术舞台。《智取威虎山》中的杨子荣，就是这样一个激动人心的高大的革命英雄形象。
    在旧京剧舞台上，历来不是有什么赵子龙、黄天霸之类，被宣扬成威风凛凛不可一世的“英雄豪杰”吗？其实，这些都不过是封建王朝的“英雄”，地主阶级的“豪杰”罢了。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所指出的，“历史是人民创造的”，“群众是真正的英雄”。中国无产阶级及其先锋队，早已登上了政治舞台，早已把帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义赶出了政治舞台。“俱往矣，数风流人物，还看今朝。”伟大的毛泽东时代的无产阶级革命英雄形象，就是今天社会主义京剧舞台上的当然主人！
    你看，我们时代的、我们无产阶级的高大的英雄形象——杨子荣，雄姿英发，登上了京剧舞台。这个雇农出身的革命战士，父母被地主害死，对阶级敌人怀着不共戴天的深仇大恨。林彪同志说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”这个剥削，就是阶级对阶级的剥削。我们的杨子荣，他并没有只局限于看到自己个人和家庭的受剥削受压迫。在深山问苦中，猎户女儿常宝控诉了座山雕匪帮害死她祖母和母亲，逼得她女扮男装充哑巴的血泪史，杨子荣听了是多么的激愤，“字字血，声声泪，激起我仇恨满腔。”在阶级斗争的大熔炉中，他懂得了“普天下被压迫的人民都有一本血泪账”，他“立誓把剥削根子全拔掉”，“一心要砸碎千年铁锁链，为人民开出那万代幸福泉”。这是多么可歌可泣的雄心壮志！
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席又教导我们：“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”杨子荣把最高指示溶化在自己的血液中，落实在自己的行动上。他以解放普天下被压迫的人民为己任，远离已经解放了的美好的故乡，在茫茫的林海雪原跟土匪周旋血战。他虽然身在东北革命根据地，却放眼在乌云笼罩的全中国以至整个世界，“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展，哪怕是火海刀山也扑上前。恨不得急令飞雪化春水，迎来春天换人间。”在阶级斗争大风大浪的锻炼和考验中，这个“身经百战，出生入死，屡建勋劳”的共产党员，确立了完全彻底为人民的思想，树立了一心为公、一心为革命的共产主义世界观。在这样一个用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命英雄形象面前，旧京剧舞台上那些只为一小撮剥削阶级寄生虫谋利的所谓“英雄豪杰”，岂不全都成了泰山脚下的一抔黄土！
    为共产主义的伟大理想而奋斗的无产阶级革命英雄，是真正大无畏的足智多谋的无敌战士。你看，杨子荣只身入虎穴，战斗在敌人的心脏。他碰见一群气势汹汹的土匪，象对付几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，全不放在眼里。他冲着虎视眈眈的匪首座山雕和八大金刚，昂首阔步走进威虎厅。他抓住敌人的卑劣心理，巧妙地编出获取联络图的经过，使座山雕转威严为媚色，而自己则变被动为主动。他一眼识破了座山雕虚造我军进攻声势的试探性诡计，来一个将计就计，领匪徒演习追击，既打消了敌人的猜疑，又及时送出了情报。在舌战栾平这场出乎意料的激烈斗争中，杨子荣不但斗败了这个狡猾的匪徒，也把老奸巨猾、诡计多端的座山雕弄得神昏志迷，完全坠入杨子荣的罗网。
    杨子荣这么大的气魄和胆量，这么大的智慧和本领，从何而来？来自党，来自人民群众，来自战无不胜的毛泽东思想！他深知“党给我智慧给我胆。”他既不为名，又不图利，一心为着无产阶级的革命事业而奋斗，所以他无所畏惧，完全把个人安危置之度外，“明知征途有艰险，越是艰险越向前”。
    在杨子荣这样的大智大勇的无产阶级英雄形象面前，旧京剧舞台上那些完全脱离人民的外强中干的所谓“英雄豪杰”，岂不全都成了雄鹰底下的家雀，骏马身后的蛤蟆！
    杨子荣，他只是我们时代千千万万革命英雄中的一个。无产阶级革命事业，要消灭一切剥削阶级，一切剥削制度，要对整个旧社会进行天翻地覆的最彻底的改造。在这样前无古人的伟大事业中，在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育下，从工农兵中涌现出了许许多多“敢教日月换新天”的革命英雄人物。毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”今天，我们工农兵就是要“利用”这个京剧艺术舞台，来表现自己气壮山河的英雄业绩，表现自己可歌可泣的英雄人物。象杨子荣这样闪闪发光的高大的革命英雄形象，集中体现了无产阶级的远大理想和优秀品质，他是社会主义京剧舞台上当之无愧的主人！什么帝王将相、才子佳人，赵子龙、黄天霸之类统治我们京剧舞台的倒行逆施的现象，再也不能继续下去了。京剧舞台必须还给工农兵，还给无产阶级！喝令帝王将相滚开，杨子荣来了！工农兵来了！
    无产阶级革命英雄形象登上京剧舞台，这是毛泽东文艺思想的伟大胜利！京剧舞台要不要表现无产阶级革命英雄形象，从根本上说，就是要不要使伟大的毛泽东思想占领京剧舞台的问题。我们就是要让用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命英雄形象占领我们的京剧舞台，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想把整个京剧舞台照得通红通红。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，是无产阶级革命英雄形象登上京剧舞台的一只最大的拦路虎。他胡说什么帝王将相、才子佳人“唱唱也不要紧，唱了这么多年，不是唱出个新中国吗？”呸！司马昭之心，路人皆知！你的真实用心是要“唱出”一个封建主义、资本主义复辟的旧中国，你的险恶目的是要把京剧舞台作为资产阶级争夺我们青年一代的地盘！妄想叫我们这一代青年拜倒在帝王将相、才子佳人的脚下，解除我们思想上的武装，去充当资产阶级的接班人和复辟资本主义的殉葬品。这是作梦！我们红卫兵战士最最听毛主席的话，最最渴望学习象杨子荣那样的用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命英雄人物。我们就是要象杨子荣那样，赤胆忠心为革命，完全彻底为人民，誓做“全心全意为中国和世界的绝大多数人服务的”无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们要象杨子荣那样，到群众运动的大风大浪中去滚一身泥巴，到阶级斗争的枪林弹雨中去熏一身火药味，炼一副硬骨头，学一套真本领，去和一切反动势力作拚死的斗争，去开辟一个红通通的新世界！
    为了使无产阶级革命英雄形象更多更多地登上京剧舞台，永远永远地成为京剧舞台的主人，我们就必须拿出杨子荣打虎那样的勇气和胆略，把京剧革命和整个无产阶级文化大革命的最大的拦路虎——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派打翻在地，把他踢出我们社会主义的政治舞台！
