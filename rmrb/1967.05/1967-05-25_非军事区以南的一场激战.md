Liberation forces in the Quang Tri Province of South Vietnam, after meticulous preparation, launched a fierce attack on the U.S. Marine Corps' Xa Xinh (formerly known as Xa Son) base on April 24. Xa Xinh is located in a basin south of the Demilitarized Zone, near the Vietnam-Laos border, surrounded by wooded hills. Hill 881 and Hill 861 are adjacent to Highway 9. Inside this base, there are two battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Division and several battalions of the puppet special forces.

In this battle, the liberation forces fully utilized their flexible and mobile tactics, striking fear into the enemy and causing heavy casualties. On the afternoon of April 24, the liberation forces first surrounded a puppet special forces unit that had come out to "sweep" the area. When the American aggressors rushed out, the liberation forces ambushed them, killing 40 U.S. invaders. The next morning, the U.S. aggressors, unwilling to accept defeat, came out again to "sweep," and the liberation forces launched another ambush, killing nearly 80 American devils.

On April 26, the American aggressors hastily used helicopters to transport three battalions from Dong Ha and Son Thuy bases to Xa Xinh. After 12 hours of fierce fighting, the liberation forces repelled numerous counterattacks by the American aggressors, who were backed by many aircraft and artillery, killing over 150 enemy soldiers, including a U.S. Army major.

Afterward, the liberation forces continued to launch fierce attacks on the American devils around the basin, defeating them thoroughly, especially on Hill 881, Hill 861, and the land of Wei Village, which was stained with the blood of the American aggressors.

Under the attacks of the liberation forces, the American aggressors continuously sent reinforcements to the area. On May 1, two battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attacked a hillside northeast of Hill 881. Soldiers of the liberation forces immediately launched a fierce counterattack as the enemy approached their positions, killing 106 U.S. invaders on the spot. The U.S. aggressors, suffering a heavy blow, retreated with their dead and wounded to the foot of the hill. That day, the enemy dispatched 80 sorties of various types of aircraft, including B-52 strategic bombers, to bomb the hill all day. However, when the enemy camped at the foot of the hill, the liberation forces suddenly launched a barrage of artillery fire, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers. On May 2, the U.S. aggressors launched multiple attacks, but all were repelled by the soldiers of the liberation forces.

After suffering heavy losses for two consecutive days, the American aggressors again airdropped reinforcements around Hill 881. At 3 a.m. on May 3, a U.S. battalion, taking advantage of the fog, advanced up the mountain. The liberation forces launched a charge, engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, and annihilated batch after batch of enemy soldiers. After 30 minutes of fighting, the liberation forces almost completely wiped out this battalion of enemies. Then, two more battalions of enemies charged up, but the soldiers of the liberation forces defended their positions, repelling the enemy's attacks. The soldiers immediately used the lull in the battle to reinforce their positions and clean their weapons, preparing for the enemy's next attack. Sure enough, after the enemy's jet fighters conducted a day of heavy bombing, the exhausted U.S. Marine Corps was driven to launch another attack. The liberation forces, riding on the momentum of victory, opened fire as the enemy approached, killing and wounding many. From 3 a.m. to the evening of May 3, the heroic soldiers on Hill 881 repelled multiple enemy attacks, killing 111 U.S. soldiers on the spot. Three battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Regiment were severely decimated. On May 5, the liberation forces again repelled 12 charges by two battalions of enemy soldiers.

From April 24 to May 5, over 12 days, the liberation forces in the Xa Xinh area killed 1,500 U.S. Marine Corps soldiers and wounded hundreds more, rendering six battalions of U.S. troops combat ineffective.

    非军事区以南的一场激战
    越南南方广治省解放武装力量经过周密的准备后，在四月二十四日首先对美国海军陆战队溪星（前译为溪山）基地内的敌人发动了猛烈的攻击。溪星位于非军事区以南靠近越南老挝边界的一个盆地内，周围都是树木丛生的山岗，其中八八一高地和八六一高地靠在九号公路旁边。在这个基地内驻有美国海军陆战队第三师的两个连和伪军别动队几个连。
    在这次战斗中，解放武装力量高度发挥了机动灵活的战术，打得敌人心惊胆战，伤亡惨重。四月二十四日下午，解放武装力量首先在这个基地附近包围了一支出来“扫荡”的伪军别动队。等基地内美国强盗赶出来时，解放武装力量就伏击了这支敌军，打死美国侵略军四十名。第二天上午，美国侵略军死不甘心，又出来“扫荡”，解放武装力量又打了一场伏击战，消灭美国鬼子近八十名。
    四月二十六日，美国强盗急忙用直升飞机把美军三个连从东河、新林等基地运到溪星来。解放武装力量经过连续十二个小时的英勇战斗，粉碎了美国强盗在许多飞机和大炮掩护下的多次反扑，消灭敌人一百五十多名，其中包括美军中校指挥官一名。
    此后，解放武装力量在这个盆地的周围接连对美国鬼子发动了猛烈的攻击，打得敌人落花流水，尤其是在八八一高地、八六一高地和卫村的土地上，染满了美国侵略强盗的污血。
    在解放武装力量的打击下，美国强盗不断增派援军到这个地区来。五月一日，美国海军陆战队两个营在飞机、大炮的掩护下，向八八一高地东北部的一个山坡发动进攻。解放武装力量某部战士们在敌人迫近阵地时立即给予他们猛烈打击，当场打死美国侵略军一百零六名。美国侵略军遭到迎头痛击，被迫拖着死的和伤的逃到了山脚下。这一天，敌人出动包括B—52型战略轰炸机在内的各种类型飞机八十架次对高地进行了一整天的狂轰滥炸。但是，当敌人在山脚下驻扎时，解放武装力量又突然对敌驻地进行了雨点般的炮击，打死打伤很多敌人。五月二日，美国侵略军又发动了多次进攻，但都被解放武装力量的战士们打退。
    美国强盗接连两天遭到沉重打击以后，又向八八一高地周围空投援军。五月三日凌晨三时，美军一个连利用迷雾向山上前进，解放武装力量发起冲锋，同敌人拚刺刀，消灭了一批又一批敌人。经过三十分钟的战斗，解放武装力量几乎全歼这个连的敌人。接着，两个连的敌人又不顾死活地冲上来，解放武装力量的战士们坚守阵地，同敌人争夺每一个工事，打退了敌人的进攻。战士们立即利用战斗空隙加固工事，擦拭武器，准备敌人的再次攻击。果然在敌人的喷气式飞机进行狂轰滥炸以后，疲惫不堪的美国海军陆战队又被指挥官驱赶着发动了进攻。解放武装力量发扬胜利气势，等敌人逼近时猛烈开火，打得敌人死伤累累。从三日凌晨三时到晚上，八八一高地上的英雄战士们打退了敌人的多次进攻，当场打死美军一百十一名。美国海军陆战队第三团的三个连被严重杀伤。五月五日，解放武装力量又粉碎了两连敌人发动的十二次冲锋。
    解放武装力量从四月二十四日到五月五日的十二天里，在溪星地区共打死美国海军陆战队一千五百名，打伤数百名，有六个连的美军丧失了战斗力。
