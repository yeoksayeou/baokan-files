What Have They Done with Their Privileged Positions?

	Workshop Director Persecutes Worker

	A young female spinning worker was fired by the workshop director for refusing to agree to the factory's illegal demand that she work the night shift. The workshop director also instructed the dormitory manager not to process her departure paperwork, "took away her bedding, seized her citizen's ID," and she did not receive her final pay from the accountant. She "trodden the factory's doors down" to get her severance pay, but those "heartless" leaders paid her no mind. Because she had no citizen's ID, she "drifted for two months in another city," unable to find work, and could not bear it, so she committed suicide. The criminal workshop director not only went unpunished but was promoted.

	(According to the Soviet Union's *Komsomolskaya Pravda*)

	Enterprise Director Uses Public Funds to Build Private Residence

	It is already winter, but the production buildings of the Kamenets-Podolsky Parquet Flooring Enterprise of the Lviv Economic Council in Ukraine have not been repaired, and the workshops are freezing cold. The product quality is poor. Where is the director's attention focused? The answer is that Director Ostyakov is focusing on how to use the enterprise's money to expand his own house.

	In 1951, Ostyakov built a two-room house including a kitchen, with a total area of 64 square meters. The enterprise spent 4,512 rubles on the construction of this house.

	In 1962, Ostyakov built another two-room house with a total area of 25.6 square meters. All the enterprise funds allocated for major repairs of workers' housing were used to expand the director's house.

	In 1964, under the pretext of major repairs to the enterprise's housing, Ostyakov expanded two more rooms, a summer kitchen, and a bathroom.

	(According to the Soviet Union's *Pravda Ukrainy*)

	Factory Director Installs Cronies

	The factory director "brutally treats workers and cultivates family influence." His nephew is the production supervisor for weaving, "his wife has long been the chief norm setter. Many major issues, including summarizing the workshop competition, are often decided in family meetings." "The workers have long been talking about the factory's 'family key,'" "the director and his wife use their own key to open the unguarded factory entrance. In short, there is a private backdoor in the state-owned enterprise."

	(According to the Soviet Union's *Pravda*)

    他们利用特权地位干了些什么？  
    车间主任迫害工人
    一少年女细纱工因不同意工厂违法要她上夜班，被车间主任无理开除。车间主任还指使宿舍管理主任不给她办理离厂手续，“拿走了她的被褥，夺走了她的公民证”，她也没有从会计那儿领到结算工资。她为了领离职工资“踏破了工厂的门”，但是那些“铁石心肠的”领导人谁也不管她。因为没有公民证，她“在另一个城市里漂泊了两个月”，找不到工作，不堪忍受而自杀。犯罪的车间主任不但没有受惩罚，反被提升了。

    企业经理用公款盖私宅
    已经是冬天了，可是乌克兰利沃夫国民经济委员会卡缅斯克—布格镶木地板联合企业的生产用房还未进行修理，各个车间是一片寒冷。产品质量低劣。人们要问，经理的注意力放在什么地方？回答是奥斯佳科夫经理正把自己的注意力放在如何利用企业的钱来扩建自己的房屋上。
    一九五一年，奥斯佳科夫建了一所双开间的包括一间厨房、总面积达六十四平方米的住房。企业为这所住房的建筑花了四千五百一十二个卢布。
    一九六二年，奥斯佳科夫又筑了双开间的总面积达二十五点六平方米的住房。拨给工人住房进行大修用的全部企业资金，完全用来扩建了经理的住房。
    一九六四年，在企业大修住房的名义下，奥斯佳科夫又扩建两间房，一间夏季厨房和一间澡堂。

    工厂经理安插亲信
    工厂经理“粗暴地对待工人，培植家族势力”。他侄子担任织布生产主任，“他的妻子长期当主任定额员。许多大问题，对车间竞赛作总结也包括在内，常常开家庭会议来决定”。“职工中早就流传着工厂的‘家庭钥匙’的谈论”，“经理和他的妻子用自己的钥匙打开没有任何人守卫的工厂入口。……总而言之，国营企业中有私人的便门”。
                                       （据苏联《真理报》）
