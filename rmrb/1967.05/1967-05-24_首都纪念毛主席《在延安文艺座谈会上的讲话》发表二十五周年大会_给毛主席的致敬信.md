	Capital Celebrates the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"
	Letter of Salute to Chairman Mao

	Dearest Chairman Mao:

	In the midst of the great struggle to criticize the biggest group of capitalist roaders in the Party, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital solemnly gather to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the publication of your brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." With hearts filled with boundless respect and excitement, we pay our highest proletarian cultural revolutionary combat salute to you, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman! We shout: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

	Your great work, "Talks," has conducted a profoundly incisive critique of the reactionary trends that emerged in the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front. It has established the most complete, thorough, correct, and revolutionary proletarian literary and artistic line for all revolutionary literary and artistic workers in China and the world; it has formulated the great military principles for building a proletarian cultural revolutionary army. It has elevated Marxism-Leninism's worldview and literary theory to a new stage, serving as a powerful ideological weapon to eradicate all reactionary cultures and a guide to action for revolutionary literary and artistic workers and revolutionary intellectuals to transform their worldviews.

	However, the biggest group of capitalist roaders in the Party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists under their support, such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan, have fiercely opposed and slandered your "Talks." Through their control of the old Propaganda Department, the old Cultural Department, and the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and using the propaganda platforms they have seized, they have spread poison, opposing literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics, actively paving the way for the restoration of capitalism. Over the past decade or so since the founding of the nation, in the literary and artistic circles, these reactionary elements, represented by these reactionaries, have seized power from us.

	We will never forget that over the past 17 years, you have issued a series of brilliant directives to guide the struggle between the two lines on the literary and artistic front, personally initiating and leading major criticism and struggle campaigns, seizing one after another positions from the hands of the bourgeoisie and their agents, and achieving one glorious victory after another!

	It is you, with your extraordinary Marxism-Leninism wisdom and genius, and with your great courage, who initiated this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, exposing the hidden Chinese Khrushchev within the Party and the small clique of capitalist roaders in power, exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist leaders who have seized the leadership of the literary and artistic circles, overthrowing the tyrants, liberating the little ghosts, and pronouncing the death sentence on the revisionist literary and artistic line.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the literary and artistic circles, under the warm care and guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, correctly apply your brilliant thoughts, creating outstanding models of proletarian literature and art such as the modern revolutionary Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and "The Attack on the White Tiger Regiment," the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," "The White-Haired Girl," and the revolutionary symphonic music "Shajiabang." We have achieved great victories that shook the entire stage of art, shook the entire China and the world, and sounded the advance signal for the proletarian cultural revolution. This is the great victory of the revolutionary literary and artistic line you established to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the great victory of your "Talks."

	Dearest Chairman Mao! We pledge to you: We will seriously study and apply "Talks" and all your directives, thoroughly criticize the biggest group of capitalist roaders in the Party, thoroughly criticize the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary "authorities," and thoroughly eliminate all the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line; while conducting thorough criticism, we will further improve the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, unite the majority of cadres and masses, and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

	Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in our hearts! We revolutionary literary and artistic workers will always remember your earnest teachings in "Talks": "China's revolutionary writers and artists, writers and artists with a future, must go among the people, must go among the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally and wholeheartedly..." We will launch a high tide of going deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, settling down in factories, rural areas, and military units for a long time, sincerely learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We will study and apply your works actively, thoroughly transforming our worldviews in the fiery class struggle. We will discard fame and profit; we will undergo a thorough transformation of our thoughts, feelings, and styles that are incompatible with the proletariat. We will serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for life, serve proletarian politics for life, and serve the proletarian dictatorship for life!

	Dearest Chairman Mao! We will follow your teachings in "Talks," take up the pen as a sword, and bravely join the battle, burying "feudalism," "capitalism," and "revisionism" thoroughly! We will establish new things for socialism and establish the peculiarities of the proletariat. We will sing the praises of the proletarian heroes, loudly shout for the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and let the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with your brilliant thoughts stand forever on the stage of literature and art. We will make our literature and art truly become "a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy."

	Dearest Chairman Mao: It is a great happiness and pride to be one of your literary and artistic soldiers. We will always remember your teachings: "All Party members, the entire nation, do not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be very vigilant and never lose alertness." We will eliminate the current literary and artistic line, and there will still be future literary and artistic lines to struggle against. We will forever be the Red Guards of your revolutionary literary and artistic line. Whenever there is a black line, we will rebel against it, take the initiative to attack, and stir up a 12-level typhoon to uproot the revisionist literary and artistic line!

	Dearest Chairman Mao: We will forever be loyal to you, loyal to your thoughts, and loyal to your revolutionary line. We will, under your leadership—the great supreme commander—carry out the long march of the proletarian cultural revolution!

	We sincerely wish you eternal life! Eternal life!! Eternal life!!!

    首都纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会
    给毛主席的致敬信最最敬爱的毛主席：
    在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行大批判的伟大战役中，我们首都无产阶级革命派，隆重集会，热烈庆祝您的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。我们怀着万分崇敬、万分激动的心情，向您，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，致以最崇高的无产阶级文化大革命的战斗敬礼！我们高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    您的伟大著作《讲话》，针对文化战线上两条道路斗争中出现的反动思潮，进行了极其深刻的批判。为全中国、全世界的革命文艺工作者，制定了一条最完整、最彻底、最正确、最革命的无产阶级文艺路线；制定了建设无产阶级文化革命大军的伟大建军纲领。它把马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论提高到一个崭新的阶段，它是铲除一切反动文化的强大思想武器，是革命文艺工作者、革命知识分子改造世界观的行动指南。
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他支持下的彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，却疯狂地反对和诋毁您的《讲话》。他们通过自己所控制的旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委，利用他们窃踞的宣传阵地，大肆放毒，反对文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务，积极为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。建国十几年来，在文艺界，以这些反动家伙为代表的文艺黑线专了我们的政。
    我们永远不会忘记，十七年来，您发出了一系列指导文艺战线上两条路线斗争的光辉指示，亲自发动和领导了历次重大的批判斗争，从资产阶级及其代理人的手里夺回一个又一个的阵地，取得一个又一个的辉煌胜利！
    是您，以极其卓越的马克思列宁主义的智慧与天才，以极其伟大的魄力，发动了这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，揪出了隐藏在党内的中国的赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揪出了窃踞文艺界领导权的反革命修正主义头头们，打倒了阎王，解放了小鬼，宣判了修正主义文艺黑线的死刑。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们文艺界无产阶级革命派，在江青同志的亲切关怀和指导下，正确运用您的光辉思想，创造出革命京剧现代戏《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，革命交响音乐《沙家浜》等无产阶级文艺的优秀样板，取得了震动整个艺术舞台、震动整个中国和世界的伟大胜利，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。这是您所制定的为工农兵服务的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，是您的《讲话》的伟大胜利。
    最最敬爱的毛主席！我们向您保证：我们一定认真地学习、运用《讲话》和您的一切指示，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批判文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，彻底批判资产阶级反动“权威”，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的一切流毒；在大批判的同时，进一步搞好本单位的斗批改，团结干部和群众的大多数，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席啊，我们心中最红最红的红太阳！我们革命文艺工作者，一定牢记您在《讲话》中的谆谆教导：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去……。”我们将掀起一个深入到工农兵中去的高潮，到工厂、农村、连队去长期安家落户，老老实实地向工农兵学习。活学活用您的著作，在火热的阶级斗争中彻底改造世界观。什么名呀利呀，统统扔掉；把和无产阶级格格不入的思想、感情、作风来一番脱胎换骨的大改造。为工农兵服务一辈子，为无产阶级政治服务一辈子，为无产阶级专政服务一辈子！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！我们一定遵照您在《讲话》中的教导，拿起笔来当刀枪，英勇地投入战斗，把“资”、“封”、“修”彻底埋葬！标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异。歌颂无产阶级的英雄人物，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设大喊大叫，让您的光辉思想所武装起来的工农兵英雄形象，永远屹立在文艺舞台上。使我们的文艺真正成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    最最敬爱的毛主席：我们能做您的一名文艺战士，是多么幸福，多么自豪。我们一定永远牢记您的教导：“全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”搞掉了现在的文艺黑线，还会有将来的文艺黑线，还得再斗争。我们永远做您的革命文艺路线的红卫兵。什么时候有了黑线，我们就造它的反，就主动进攻，就刮起十二级台风，把修正主义文艺黑线连根拔掉！
    最最敬爱的毛主席：我们永远忠于您，忠于您的思想，忠于您的革命路线。我们要在您——伟大统帅的率领下，举行无产阶级文化革命的万里长征！
    我们衷心地祝愿您万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！万寿无疆！！！
    首都纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会
                                      一九六七年五月二十三日
