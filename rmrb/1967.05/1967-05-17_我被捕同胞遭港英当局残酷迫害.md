Hong Kong British authorities have, in recent days, subjected workers, students, and compatriots who have been unjustly arrested to horrifying persecution in police stations and prisons.

According to the victims, those detained in police stations are crammed into cells with more than ten people each. They are given only a small amount of food that is sour and smelly, making it undrinkable, and plain water. They are beaten in turns, with many being beaten to the point of vomiting blood and fainting. When injured compatriots are sent to the hospital, plainclothes police from the Hong Kong British authorities beat them all the way to the hospital.

One worker revealed that the British authorities' fascist thugs lured ten detained compatriots into a room, forcing them to sit in a row on low stools. As soon as they sat down, more than ten thugs standing in front of and behind them began punching and kicking them, continuing for over an hour.

The Hong Kong British authorities harbor extreme hatred for the invincible great Mao Zedong Thought and the Red Guards. During interrogation, a worker angrily denounced the British authorities' fascist thugs for defaming our great leader Chairman Mao. The thug viciously stabbed the worker's chest with a pen. These fascist thugs shouted, "Beat this Red Guard!" as they savagely beat a teenager.

A bank employee and other persecuted compatriots were taken to the police station. A British thug asked who was reading Chairman Mao's quotations. The employee bravely stood up and said, "I am!" The thug ordered him to recite, and he immediately loudly recited, "Resolutely determine to fight to the end, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The thug immediately punched him, beating him for over ten minutes. The next day, the British authorities' thugs punched his lips and abdomen and viciously kicked him off the stool. Another thug brutally kicked his chest.

A photographer was unjustly arrested and taken to the police station. The British authorities' fascist thugs searched his body and, upon finding a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouted, "Those with quotations need to be well-treated." The thugs then beat him and several other unjustly arrested compatriots, shouting, "Those with Chairman Mao's quotations need to be kicked more."

The bloody suppression and persecution of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots by the Hong Kong British authorities have aroused the utmost indignation of our compatriots. They hate imperialism to the core and love our great leader Chairman Mao even more, vowing to fight to the end against the British authorities' anti-China plots.

    我被捕同胞遭港英当局残酷迫害
  据新华社香港十六日电　香港英国当局连日来在警署和监狱里对我无辜被捕的工人、学生和同胞，进行了骇人听闻的迫害。
    据被迫害的同胞揭发，被拘捕在警署内的同胞，都是十多人挤在一个囚室里，每天只给一点又酸又臭根本不能下咽的饭和生水。他们都轮番遭到毒打，许多人被打得吐血以至昏迷。受伤的同胞在被送往医院的时候，又被香港英国当局随车的便衣警察边行边打，一直打到医院。
    一位受害的工人揭露说，香港英国当局的法西斯暴徒把十名被囚的同胞骗到一个房间内，强迫他们并排坐在一列矮凳上。当他们坐下的时候，站在他们前后的十多名暴徒就一齐对他们拳打脚踢，连续打了一个多小时。
    香港英国当局极端仇视战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想和红卫兵小将。一位工人在被逼供的时候，怒斥香港英国当局的法西斯暴徒对我伟大领袖毛主席的污辱，那个暴徒竟恶毒地用笔杆向他的胸部插去。这些法西斯暴徒在毒打一名十多岁的学生时疯狂地叫嚣：“打你这个红卫兵！”
    一位银行的职工和其他受迫害的同胞被押到警署后，一个港英暴徒就问是谁读毛主席语录的。这位职工毫无惧色地站出来说：“是我！”那个暴徒就叫他朗读，他立即高声朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”暴徒立即挥拳向他打来，一连把他毒打了十多分钟。第二天，香港英国当局的暴徒又用拳头打他的唇和小腹，并凶狠地把他从凳上踢倒在地，另一个暴徒又残暴地猛踢他的胸部。
    一位摄影师被无理拘捕到警署以后，香港英国当局的法西斯暴徒就搜了他的身体，当搜出他身上带的《毛主席语录》本时，那个暴徒就叫嚷：“有《语录》的要好好地炮制一下。”接着，暴徒们就毒打他和另外几个无辜被捕的同胞，边打还边叫：“有《毛主席语录》的要多踢”。
    香港英国当局血腥镇压和迫害香港中国同胞的罪行，激起我同胞的无比愤慨，他们切齿痛恨帝国主义，更加热爱我们的伟大领袖毛主席，表示坚决要同香港英国当局的反华阴谋斗争到底。
