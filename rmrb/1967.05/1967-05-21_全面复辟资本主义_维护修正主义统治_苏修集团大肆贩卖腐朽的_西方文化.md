The Soviet revisionist leading group, in order to restore capitalism, has been engaged in extensive "cultural exchanges" with the United States over the years, peddling "Western culture," poisoning the Soviet people, and corrupting the younger generation.

As early as 1958, the Khrushchev traitor clique signed the first "cultural exchange" agreement with the United States, opening the door wide for American cultural aggression. Since 1958, the Soviet Union and the United States have signed a two-year agreement every two years, without interruption. The fifth agreement is currently in effect.

The magazine "America," which boasts of the "prosperity" of the decadent and declining capitalist system, the aggressive policies of American imperialism, and promotes jazz music, modern dance, abstract art, American fashion, etc., has been published in the Soviet Union since October 1956 without interruption, with its circulation increasing from over 20,000 to over 60,000.

In recent years, American films have flooded Soviet screens. According to Romanovskii, Chairman of the Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, "hundreds of copies of American films are touring our country." It is reported that sometimes "three-fifths of the cinemas in Moscow are showing American films." The film "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World," which promotes the "American way of life," is being shown simultaneously in over 40 cinemas in Moscow.

Since 1958, several American performing groups or individuals have visited the Soviet Union each year to promote jazz and other decadent cultural products. In the modern and abstract dances performed by the American ballet troupe during their visit to the Soviet Union, the performers wore tight pants and loose short jackets, jumping to the accompaniment of jazz and strange, atonal music. Such performances were highly praised by the Soviet revisionists.

Literary works promoting bourgeois individualism from the United States have also been widely translated and published. The editor of the Soviet "Literary Gazette" admitted in a conversation: "The best-selling books in the Soviet foreign book market are American novels."

Since 1958, the United States has held nine exhibitions in many major cities in the Soviet Union. The content of these exhibitions, from the "material civilization" and "way of life" of American monopolistic capitalists to "abstract art," is all-encompassing. With the strong support of the Soviet revisionist group, these exhibitions have spread widely in the Soviet Union. It is reported that the first American exhibition, which extensively promoted American material civilization and way of life, attracted 2.7 million viewers.

As part of the "cultural cooperation" between the Soviet Union and the United States, the Soviet revisionists have opened the door to the American imperialist anti-communist and anti-people propaganda tool, "The Voice of America" radio station. The Soviet revisionist traitor clique reached an agreement with the American imperialists several years ago to stop interfering with "The Voice of America" broadcasts to the Soviet Union. Moreover, they reached an agreement for Soviet radio stations to directly rebroadcast "The Voice of America" and some programs supplied by the United States Information Agency. The rebroadcasted content includes press conferences by American imperialist leaders and "new achievements" of the United States.

In addition, the Soviet Union has been engaged in so-called tourist exchanges with the United States. Since 1959, tens of thousands of Americans have visited the Soviet Union each year. The Soviet Union also sends a considerable number of "tourists" to the United States to "tour." The "American way of life" is directly spread to the Soviet people through these "tourists."

The Soviet revisionist and American imperialist leaders have been singing the praises of this "cultural exchange" for the peaceful evolution in the Soviet Union in recent years. In early 1967, American imperialist leader Johnson, in an inscription for an American exhibition, said that such activities help the United States and the Soviet Union "exchange experiences and better understand each other." TASS also praised, "Soviet-American cultural cooperation is beneficial." Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Ball once revealed the "benefits" of this. He pointed out that such activities "often produce effects that cannot be achieved by any other means."

    全面复辟资本主义　维护修正主义统治
    苏修集团大肆贩卖腐朽的“西方文化”
    据新华社二十日讯　本社记者报道：苏修领导集团为了复辟资本主义，多年来大搞苏美“文化交流”，贩卖“西方文化”，毒害苏联人民，腐蚀年青一代。
    早在一九五八年，赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团就同美国签订了第一个“文化交流”协定，为美国的文化侵略敞开大门。自一九五八年以来，苏美每两年签订一个为期两年的协定，从未中断。目前已经在执行第五个“协定”了。
    以吹嘘腐朽没落的资本主义制度的“繁荣景象”、美帝国主义的侵略政策以及宣扬爵士音乐、现代派舞蹈、抽象派艺术、美式时装等等为主要内容的《美国》画报，自一九五六年十月在苏联发行以来，出版从未间断，发行量由两万多份增到六万多份。
    近年来，美国电影充斥苏联银幕。据苏联对外文化联络委员会主任罗曼诺夫斯基承认，经常有“几百部美国影片拷贝在我们国内巡回放映”。据报道，有时甚至“莫斯科三分之二的影院都在放映美国影片”。宣扬“美国生活方式”的影片《这是疯狂、疯狂、疯狂、疯狂的世界》，在莫斯科四十多家电影院同时放映。
    一九五八年来，每年都有几批美国演出团体或个人到苏联表演，推销阿飞舞、爵士乐等黑货。在美国芭蕾舞剧团访苏演出的现代派抽象派舞蹈中，演员身穿瘦腿裤、宽大的短上衣，在爵士乐和无调的古怪音响伴奏下，跳着离奇古怪的动作。这种节目得到了苏修的捧场。
    宣扬资产阶级个人主义的美国文学作品，也被大量翻译出版。苏联《文学报》主编在一次谈话中承认：“苏联外国书籍市场上的畅销书是美国小说。”
    一九五八年以来，美国在苏联许多大城市举办了九个展览会。这些展览会的内容，从美国垄断资产阶级的“物质文明”、“生活方式”到“抽象派艺术”等等，无所不有。在苏修集团的大力支持下，这些展览会在苏联流毒甚广。据报道，大肆宣扬美国物质文明和生活方式的第一个美国展览会，观众达到二百七十万人。
    作为苏美“文化合作”的一个方面，苏修为美帝反共反人民的御用工具——“美国之音”广播电台敞开了大门。苏修叛徒集团早在几年前就同美帝达成了停止干扰“美国之音”对苏广播的协议。不仅如此，他们还达成协议，由苏联电台直接转播“美国之音”和美国新闻署供应的一些节目。转播的内容包括美帝首脑的记者招待会、美国的“新成就”等。
    此外，苏联还同美国大搞所谓旅客交流。一九五九年来，每年有一、两万美国人到苏联。苏联每年也有不少“旅客”去美国“游览”。“美国生活方式”通过这些“旅客”，直接地传播到苏联群众中去。
    苏修、美帝头目们，近年来一直一唱一和地为这种在苏联推行“和平演变”的苏美“文化交流”大声叫好。美帝头目约翰逊今年年初在为一个美国展览会题词时说，这类活动有助于美国和苏联“交流经验和更好地增加相互了解”。塔斯社也赞扬说，“苏美文化合作是有益处的。”美国前助理国务卿巴特尔曾经一语道破了“益处”之所在。他指出，这种活动“常常产生了用其他任何方式所达不到的效果。”
