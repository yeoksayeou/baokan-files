The People's Liberation Army Beijing Garrison Unit 4672 actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to support the leftist masses. During their military training at Beijing Normal University, they firmly stood with the revolutionary leftists, conducted in-depth political and ideological work on the conservative forces and the middle-of-the-road elements, dissolved the conservative organizations, raised the class consciousness of the middle-of-the-road elements, and strengthened and consolidated the leftist forces. Revolutionary teachers and students unanimously praised the PLA for their firm stance and clear banner, truly supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students and the PLA are as close as brothers. With the help of the PLA, Beijing Normal University has now achieved a revolutionary great alliance throughout the school, and the revolutionary committee with the "three-in-one combination" has been officially established.

I. Solving the Stand Issue through Investigation, Clearly Supporting the Leftists

When the higher authorities assigned the military training task to Unit 4672, they clearly stated that they should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly support the leftist masses, and together with the revolutionary leftists, criticize the capitalist roaders within the party who hold power and their reactionary bourgeois line. They emphasized fighting a political battle and not engaging in compromise and conciliation. However, out of the 150 comrades sent to Beijing Normal University, the vast majority had not participated in the actual struggle of the Cultural Revolution and lacked understanding of the two-line struggle and the revolutionary leftists. They all felt at a loss as to how to support the leftists and criticize the reactionary bourgeois line.

Chairman Mao said: "Can't you solve that problem? Then go and investigate the current state and history of that problem!" The comrades of the unit, following Chairman Mao's instructions, invited the responsible comrade of the Jian Gangshan Commune, Tan Houlan, to systematically introduce the situation of the Cultural Revolution at Beijing Normal University over the past eight months, especially how the work team of the capitalist roaders within the party protected the capitalist roaders within the party, shielded the bad elements, suppressed the revolution, and labeled revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and "fake leftists," etc. They also mobilized those who had been labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" by the work team to expose the crimes of the reactionary bourgeois line.

Through the investigation and learning Chairman Mao's relevant works, the soldiers understood what the reactionary bourgeois line was and recognized the revolutionary leftists who firmly carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Thus, all the officers and soldiers decided to stand with the revolutionary leftists—the Jian Gangshan Commune. Deputy Political Commissar Li Tonghe clearly stated in a meeting with all the teachers and students that they firmly support "Jian Gangshan." Company, platoon, and squad meetings were held, and the officers and soldiers expressed their firm support for "Jian Gangshan" in their talks with the teachers and students.

II. Conducting Detailed and In-Depth Political and Ideological Work, Striving to Unite the Majority of the Masses

"Jian Gangshan" is a force that emerged from the fierce struggle against the reactionary bourgeois line. When the unit entered the school, they had already taken power. However, the opposing forces of "Jian Gangshan"—the Jian Gangshan Rebel Corps, the Torch Combat Team, the Red Flag Combat Team, and the East Red Corps—gathered together, attempting to overthrow "Jian Gangshan" and were constantly plotting to seize power from "Jian Gangshan" for the second time.

After the PLA clearly stated their firm support for "Jian Gangshan," the "Rebel Corps" and other organizations strongly protested, asking the PLA, "Why do you only rely on 'Jian Gangshan'? Why do you think we are not revolutionary organizations?" They refused to participate in military training and vowed to firmly carry out the second seizure of power. What kind of organizations are these? The comrades of the unit discovered through in-depth investigation and analysis that the core forces of the "Rebel Corps," which had the sharpest contradictions with "Jian Gangshan," were originally split from "Jian Gangshan," and some were even responsible comrades of "Jian Gangshan" who had suffered persecution from the work team. However, they had serious individualism and anarchism. The rest of the masses were mostly middle-of-the-road elements, and some were masses who had been deceived and withdrew from the conservative organizations during the criticism of the reactionary line. Their contradictions with "Jian Gangshan" were internal contradictions among the people, and most of them were issues of ideological understanding.

The comrades of the unit, following Chairman Mao's instruction that "all ideological issues and all issues of debate within the people can only be resolved through democratic methods, through methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education," conducted detailed and in-depth political and ideological work on the "Rebel Corps" and other organizations. They held various meetings such as symposiums, criticism meetings, and analysis meetings, affirming their past revolutionary spirit of rebellion, pointing out that their opposition to "Jian Gangshan" and their attempt to seize power for the second time were wrong. Deputy Political Commissar Li Tonghe and Chief of Staff Liu Tongqi tirelessly talked to the responsible comrades of various organizations, helping them analyze their mistakes and the nature of their mistakes, clearly telling them the dangers of continuing down this path. A large amount of political and ideological work made them realize their mistakes and decide to correct them. The responsible comrade of the Jian Gangshan Rebel Corps, Li Qinglin, who originally insisted on overthrowing "Jian Gangshan," voluntarily led the entire corps to carry out internal rectification and analyze their mistakes. In the summary of the rectification, they realized that they had deviated from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and voluntarily disbanded the organization. Other organizations also followed suit and disbanded. Li Qinglin and others were very grateful to the PLA, saying that the PLA's help came at a critical time and saved them.

While helping Li Qinglin and others, the comrades of the unit also conducted persuasion and education work on the responsible comrades of "Jian Gangshan," Tan Houlan, and others, strictly requiring them to learn Chairman Mao's "Study and the Current Situation" and the five conditions for successors, especially Chairman Mao's statement that "we must not only unite with those who agree with us but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us, and even those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." They helped them analyze the actual situation. Tan Houlan and others agreed with the opinions of the comrades of the unit and strove to meet the standards set by Chairman Mao, actively seeking out Li Qinglin and other comrades of the "Rebel Corps" for discussions and heart-to-heart talks, seriously pointing out their mistakes while also sincerely conducting self-criticism. Tan Houlan personally posted a big-character poster welcoming the revolutionary actions of the "Rebel Corps." The Jian Gangshan Commune headquarters also issued a statement: those who have corrected their mistakes will not be held accountable for the past and can join "Jian Gangshan." Those who withdrew from the "Rebel Corps" and those who originally followed them all applied to join "Jian Gangshan," and the awareness of the middle-of-the-road masses was thus raised. "Jian Gangshan" quickly grew from 1,800 people to 3,800 people. Now, "Jian Gangshan" members account for more than 70% of the entire school population. Li Qinglin and others have been absorbed into the work of "Jian Gangshan."

III. Focusing on the Study of Chairman Mao's Works, Fundamentally Improving the Leftist Forces

After entering the school, the comrades of the unit were eager to do what the leftists were eager to do, think what the leftists thought, and help the leftists with what they needed. They closely coordinated with the combat tasks of "Jian Gangshan" in their military training work. For example, when "Jian Gangshan" carried out rectification, military training focused on rectification and did everything possible to make it a success; when the warriors of "Jian Gangshan" went out into society to counter a period of capitalist and counter-revolutionary restoration currents, the comrades of the unit firmly supported them; when "Jian Gangshan" carried out the revolutionary great alliance throughout the school, the comrades of the unit concentrated their efforts on this work.

In the entire military training work, the comrades of the unit paid special attention to highlighting proletarian politics and focusing on the study of Chairman Mao's works to fundamentally improve the leftist forces.

After "Jian Gangshan" took power, the study of Chairman Mao's works was not tight, and many comrades were keen on making a splash, always wanting to go out, and could not sit still to study Chairman Mao's works. Some, although they studied, did not combine learning with practice. Therefore, it was necessary to make all the warriors of "Jian Gangshan" realize that studying Chairman Mao's works was fundamental, and only then could the level of this force be truly improved. To achieve this goal, the comrades of the unit actively researched with the responsible comrades of the "Jian Gangshan" logistics station, based on the needs and characteristics of revolutionary teachers and students, and adopted three measures:

1. The various levels of cadres of the unit and the various levels of cadres of "Jian Gangshan" paired up to study together. During the study, the cadres of "Jian Gangshan" talked about the difficulties and problems in their leadership work, and the comrades of the PLA analyzed and discussed solutions with them based on Chairman Mao's works. The effect was very good.

2. They launched the "five bigs" activities of "big study, big recite, big use, big sing, and big propaganda," making the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works the top political task. In this way, those who were busy running out every day and did not want to study gradually calmed down.

3. The comrades of the unit transferred ten active study members of Chairman Mao's works from their unit to introduce their vivid experiences of active study and application in the large and small study meetings throughout the school, providing active study and application experiences for the broad masses of teachers and students.

Through the help of the PLA and the efforts of the revolutionary teachers and students, the broad masses of teachers and students have now formed the habit of studying Chairman Mao's works, and most teachers and students insist on "daily reading." Some leading cadres have mostly learned to combine learning with practice and have initially done a good job of studying Chairman Mao's works when encountering problems.

    在北师大搞军训的部队是如何支持左派的？
    人民解放军北京部队4672部队积极响应毛主席关于支持左派广大群众的伟大号召，在北京师范大学搞军训期间，坚决和无产阶级革命派站在一起，对保守势力和中间派做了深入细致的政治思想工作，瓦解了保守组织，提高了中间派的阶级觉悟，壮大和巩固了左派队伍。广大革命师生一致称赞解放军立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，真正支持了无产阶级文化大革命。革命师生和解放军亲如手足。在解放军的帮助下，现在北师大已经实现了全校革命大联合，“三结合”的革命委员会已经正式成立。
    一、在调查中解决立场问题，明确支持左派
    上级交给4672部队军训任务时，明确提出要按照毛主席的指示办事，坚定地支持左派广大群众，和革命左派一起批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们提出并推行的资产阶级反动路线，要打政治仗，不要搞调和折衷。但部队去北师大的一百五十名同志，绝大部分未参加过文化大革命的实际斗争，对两条路线斗争和革命左派缺乏认识，对如何支持左派和批判资产阶级反动路线，大家都感到棘手。
    毛主席说：“你对于那个问题不能解决么？那末，你就去调查那个问题的现状和它的历史吧！”部队的同志根据毛主席这一教导，进校以后，就邀请井冈山公社负责人谭厚兰系统地介绍八个月来，北师大文化大革命的情况，特别是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派派工作组，维护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，包庇坏人，镇压革命，把革命群众打成“反革命”、“假左派”等等情况。并发动曾被工作组打成“反革命”的革命闯将控诉了资产阶级反动路线的罪恶。
    通过调查，再加上学习了毛主席的有关著作，战士们懂得了什么叫资产阶级反动路线，也认识了坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命左派。于是全体指战员下定决心，和革命左派——井冈山公社全体战士站在一起。副政委李同贺在和全体师生见面的大会上，明确表态坚决支持“井冈山”。连、排、班开会，指战员们和师生们谈话，也都表示坚决支持“井冈山”。
    二、作细致深入的政治思想工作，争取团结群众大多数
    “井冈山”是一支在同资产阶级反动路线大搏斗中撕杀出来的队伍，部队进校时，他们已经掌了权。但是，“井冈山”的对立面——井冈山造反兵团、烽火战斗队、红旗战斗队和东方红兵团集在一起，企图搞垮“井冈山”，整天酝酿从“井冈山”手中二次夺权。
    当解放军亮明坚决支持“井冈山”的旗帜以后，“造反兵团”等组织提出强烈抗议，质问解放军：“你们为什么只依靠‘井冈山’？为什么认为我们不是革命组织？”他们拒绝参加军训，并扬言坚决要搞第二次夺权。这些组织是什么性质呢？部队的同志在深入的调查分析中发现，与“井冈山”矛盾最尖锐的“造反兵团”的骨干力量原是从“井冈山”分化出去的，有的还是“井冈山”的负责人，过去遭受过工作组的迫害。但在他们身上有严重的个人主义和无政府主义。其余的群众大部分是中间派，还有一部分是在批判反动路线时退出保守组织受蒙蔽的群众。他们和“井冈山”的矛盾是属于人民内部矛盾，大部分是思想认识问题。
    部队的同志根据毛主席说的“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决”这一指示，对“造反兵团”等组织展开了细致深入的政治思想工作，召开座谈会、批评会、分析会等各种会议，肯定他们过去的革命造反精神，指出他们同“井冈山”对抗和要二次夺权是错误的。副政委李同贺和参谋长刘通启不厌其烦地分别找各组织负责人谈话，帮他们分析错误和认识错误的性质，明确告诉他们发展下去的危险性。大量的政治思想工作，使他们对自己的错误都有所认识，并决心改正。原来非要搞垮“井冈山”的井冈山造反兵团负责人李庆林自动带领全团展开内部整风，分析错误。在整风总结中，他们认识到自己已离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，自动解散了组织。其他组织也相继解散。李庆林等同志十分感激解放军，说解放军对他们的帮助很及时，挽救了他们。
    部队同志在帮助李庆林等的同时，对“井冈山”负责人谭厚兰等也进行了说服教育工作，严格要求他们，动员他们学习了毛主席的《学习和时局》和接班人的五个条件，特别是毛主席说的“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人”这一条，帮助他们联系实际进行分析。谭厚兰等很赞同部队同志的意见，努力按照毛主席提的标准要求自己，主动去找李庆林等“造反兵团”的同学座谈、谈心，一方面严肃地指出他们的错误，同时也认真做自我批评。谭厚兰本人并贴大字报对“造反兵团”的革命行动表示欢迎。井冈山公社总部还发表声明：只要是改正了错误的同志，既往不咎，可以参加“井冈山”。退出“造反兵团”的同志和原来追随他们的人都纷纷申请加入“井冈山”，中间群众的认识也因此得到提高。“井冈山”很快由一千八百多人发展到三千八百人。现在，“井冈山”成员已占全校人数的百分之七十以上。李庆林等已被吸收到“井冈山”工作。
    三、狠抓毛主席著作学习，从根本上提高左派队伍
    部队同志进校后，急左派所急，想左派所想，帮左派所需。他们在军训工作中，紧紧配合“井冈山”的战斗任务。例如，“井冈山”搞整风，军训就以整风为中心，千方百计地把整风搞好；“井冈山”战士走上社会，反击一个时期出现的一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流，部队同志就坚决作他们的后盾；“井冈山”搞全校革命大联合，部队同志就集中力量抓这项工作。
    部队同志在整个军训工作中，特别注意突出无产阶级政治，狠抓毛主席著作学习，从根本上提高左派队伍。
    井冈山公社掌权以后，学习毛主席著作抓得不紧，不少同志热衷于轰轰烈烈，整天想往外跑，坐不下来学习毛主席著作。有些虽然学习了也没有把学用结合起来。因此，只有使井冈山公社的全体战士都认识到学习毛主席著作是根本，这支队伍的水平才能真正提高。为了达到这个目的，部队的同志主动和“井冈山”总勤务站的负责人研究，根据革命师生的需要和特点，采取了三种做法：
    一、部队各级干部和“井冈山”各级干部互相对口结合学习。学习时由“井冈山”的干部谈领导工作中的困难和问题，解放军同志就和他们一起，根据毛主席著作进行分析、商量解决办法。效果很好。
    二、开展大学、大背、大用、大唱、大宣传的“五大”活动，把活学活用毛主席著作当作压倒一切的政治任务。这样，那些每天忙着往外跑不愿学习的人也慢慢安下心来。
    三、部队同志从本单位调来十位学习毛主席著作的积极分子，在全校大、小学习会上介绍他们活学活用的生动事迹，为广大师生提供了活学活用的经验。
    通过解放军的帮助，和广大革命师生的努力，现在，广大师生已养成了学习毛主席著作的习惯，大部分师生坚持了“天天读”。一些领导干部大都学会了学用结合，初步做到了遇到问题学习毛主席著作。
