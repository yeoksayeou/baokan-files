We are filled with boundless excitement and enthusiastically hail the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant document "On the Question of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun.'" In this document, Chairman Mao has mercilessly exposed the film "The Life of Wu Xun," which advocates class capitulationism, and has strongly criticized those pseudo-communists. He has lifted the lid on the struggle between the two lines in the field of literature and art since the founding of the nation. Now, the black-line figures who produced "The Life of Wu Xun" and their chief backers—the handful of top power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road—have all been exposed. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! Today's publication of this great document has extremely important guiding significance for further carrying out the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the political and ideological front, and for the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In 1951, a year when the class struggle at home and abroad was extremely sharp, the vast poor and lower-middle peasants in the newly liberated areas across the country were full of vigor and enthusiasm, and were waging a fierce struggle to reform the land system. That same year was also a critical stage in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, when our volunteers were fighting bloody battles with American imperialism every day. In the midst of such intense class struggle, the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun" brazenly advocated surrendering to the class enemy and sang the praises of a slavish and servile attitude. Wasn't this a blatant collaboration with the class enemies at home and abroad in their attack on the proletarian dictatorship? Chairman Mao has long taught us: "There is no such thing as love without a reason, nor is there such a thing as hatred without a reason." Why did those who claimed to have learned Marxism praise Wu Xun? Today, we can find the answer in the notorious "peaceful democratic new stage" fallacy of the top power-holder in the Party who is taking the capitalist road and his book "On Practice": they attempted to create counter-revolutionary public opinion and ultimately achieve the goal of overthrowing the proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism. "On the Question of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun'" exposes their conspiracy. However, the top power-holder in the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionists entrenched in the propaganda and cultural departments have been paying lip service to Chairman Mao's warnings while in fact intensifying their efforts to use literature and art as a forward position for restoring capitalism. Such counter-revolutionary revisionists must be thoroughly overthrown!

Chairman Mao has recently taught us: "Do not think that one or two or three or four Cultural Revolutions will make everything peaceful. Be on guard at all times and never relax your vigilance." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's instructions, fully understand the long-term and complex nature of class struggle in socialist society, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget the proletarian dictatorship, and ensure that the proletarian cause will last for generations and never change color!

    彻底批判阶级投降主义
    解放军空军二级战斗英雄  邹炎
    我们以无限兴奋的心情，热烈欢呼毛主席的光辉文献《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》的发表。在这篇文献中，毛主席对宣扬阶级投降主义的《武训传》作了无情的揭露，对那些冒牌共产党员作了有力的批判，揭开了建国以来文艺战线上两条路线斗争的盖子。现在炮制《武训传》的黑线人物和他们的总后台——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，都被揪出来了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！今天这篇伟大文献的发表，对于进一步开展政治思想战线上的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争，对当前的无产阶级文化大革命，具有极其重要的指导意义。
    一九五一年，正是国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐的一年。那时全国大片新解放区的广大贫下中农，意气风发，斗志昂扬，开展了改革土地制度的严重斗争；这一年，也正是抗美援朝紧张阶段，我们志愿军每天和美帝国主义进行浴血战斗。在这样激烈的阶级斗争中，反动影片《武训传》却大力宣扬向阶级敌人屈膝投降的行为，歌颂那种奴颜婢膝的丑态。这不是明目张胆配合国内外阶级敌人向无产阶级专政进攻吗？毛主席早就教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”那些号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员，为什么要这样歌颂武训呢？今天我们可以从党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的那本《修养》中，从他那个臭名昭著的“和平民主新阶段”谬论中找到答案：他们企图通过制造反革命舆论，最后达到推翻无产阶级专政、实行资本主义复辟的目的。《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》，一针见血地揭穿了他们的阴谋。但是党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和盘踞在宣传文化部门的反革命修正主义分子，他们对毛主席的警告阳奉阴违，长期以来变本加厉地把文艺当作他们复辟资本主义的前哨阵地。象这样的反革命修正主义分子，我们只有把他们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚。
    毛主席最近还教导我们：“不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”我们一定牢记毛主席的指示，充分认识社会主义社会里阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘无产阶级专政，保证无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色！
