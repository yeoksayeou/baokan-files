Editor's Note: The letter from revolutionary youth at Xi'an Metallurgical and Building Materials Institute suggesting support for the summer harvest is worth paying attention to. Now, wheat is ripening in waves, and the summer harvest is beginning. Organizing this year's summer harvest well, ensuring that the fruits of high yield truly become the fruits of a bumper harvest, is a major task in defending the great achievements of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, students from colleges and universities, and cadre from various departments should all allocate a certain amount of manpower to support the summer harvest. All departments of industry, commerce, and finance in various places should also treat supporting the summer harvest as an urgent matter.

In supporting the summer harvest, it is also necessary to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to the peasants, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," concentrating all efforts to win the battle of the summer harvest.

The busy summer harvest season has arrived. This year, the wheat in Shaanxi Province has grown exceptionally well, and the vast fields of wheat waves present a scene of a bumper harvest. The poor and lower-middle peasant members are all laughing happily, saying: Such good wheat as this year's has not been seen in recent years. This is a great victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the countryside, and it is also a great victory of the broad masses of community members and revolutionary cadres in implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Now, the urgent task before us is to truly achieve high yield and bumper harvest, to ensure that all the wheat is harvested, and to achieve "precise harvesting and fine threshing, returning every grain to the home." This is a matter of great political and economic significance.

Now, the broad masses of peasant community members in the countryside have already started taking action. However, due to the heavy tasks and short time for this summer's harvest, the agricultural work is concentrated, and the labor force is quite tense. Therefore, we suggest that the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and Red Guards in schools, departments, and enterprises in cities and towns, without affecting the current Cultural Revolution, should organize some manpower to go to the countryside to support the summer harvest. We believe that the comrades of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat and the Red Guards going to the countryside to participate in the summer harvest, on the one hand, is a response to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," ensuring a good summer harvest this year, and materially supporting the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat; on the other hand, it is also an opportunity for us to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants and to temper and transform our thoughts through labor. At the same time, it is a powerful support for the broad masses of class brothers and revolutionary comrades in the countryside.

Time is pressing, let us take immediate action!

    建议革命小将下乡支援夏收
    编者按：西安冶金建筑学院的革命小将建议支援夏收的来信，是值得重视的。现在，小麦次第黄熟，夏收陆续开始。组织好今年的夏收，使丰产的果实真正变成丰收的果实，这是保卫无产阶级文化大革命重大成果的战斗任务。
    人民解放军指战员，大中学校的学生，机关干部，都应该抽出相当人力支援夏收。各地一切工交财贸部门也应该把支援夏收作为当务之急。
    在支援夏收中，还应当向农民宣传毛泽东思想，同贫下中农一起活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，集中全力，打好夏收这一仗。
    繁忙的夏收季节已经到来了。今年陕西省的小麦普遍生长得非常好，田野上一望无际的麦浪，呈现出一片丰收景象。贫下中农社员们都乐呵呵地说：象今年这样好的小麦，是近些年来没有过的。这是农村无产阶级文化大革命的一个伟大胜利，也是广大社员和革命干部执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利。
    现在，放在眼前的一项迫切任务，就是要真正做到丰产丰收，保证把麦子全部收回来，做到“精收细打，颗粒还家”。这是有重要政治意义和经济意义的一件大事。
    现在，农村广大社员已经开始行动起来。但是，由于今年夏收的任务重，时间短，农活集中，劳动力显得相当紧张。因此，我们建议城镇里的学校、机关、企业里的无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将，在不影响当前文化大革命运动的前提下，能组织一些人力下乡，去支援夏收。我们认为，无产阶级革命派的战友和红卫兵小将下乡参加夏收，一方面是响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的号召，保证搞好今年的夏收，从物质上支援无产阶级文化大革命；另一方面也是我们向贫下中农学习，在劳动中锻炼和改造我们思想的一个好机会。同时也是我们对农村广大阶级兄弟和革命战友们的一个有力支持。
    时间已经很紧迫，让我们立即行动起来！
