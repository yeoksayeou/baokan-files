Twenty-five years ago, during a major debate and struggle in the literary and artistic circles, Chairman Mao published the epoch-making masterpiece "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Today, in the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the course of criticizing the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and in the battle to thoroughly settle accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in literature and art, this great work has further demonstrated its immense power.

"The Talks" smashed various reactionary bourgeois literary and artistic theories, provided a comprehensive and scientific summary of the basic experiences of the proletarian literary and artistic movement in our country and the world, and creatively formulated the most complete, thorough, and correct proletarian literary and artistic line. It is a brilliant example of proletarian literary and artistic theory, a new development of the Marxist-Leninist worldview, and a programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In "The Talks," Chairman Mao profoundly and systematically addressed the fundamental issue of the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Chairman Mao said: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Whether it is for the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, or for a small group of exploiting classes? For the proletariat, or for the bourgeoisie? This is the dividing line between proletarian literature and art and bourgeois literature and art; it is the focal point of the struggle between the Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought literary and artistic line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line.

Literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers means serving the needs of their struggle and their fundamental interests. The struggle needs and fundamental interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers can only be fully expressed through politics. Politics is class struggle, it is seizing power and consolidating power. Therefore, serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is also serving the political struggle of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

To adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary literary and artistic workers must firmly stand on the proletarian position, enthusiastically sing the praises of the people, the proletariat, the dictatorship of the proletariat, revolutionary struggles, and heroic figures in revolutionary struggles; ruthlessly expose the enemy's ugly faces and filthy souls, and expose the counter-revolutionary restoration plots of the bourgeoisie; make every play, every song, and every work a drum to inspire the people's revolutionary struggle and a sword piercing the enemy's heart. In short, as Chairman Mao said: "All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be sung. This is the basic task of revolutionary artists." Only in this way can literature and art become "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy," and become a powerful tool for the political struggle of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

To adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is necessary to wage a struggle against all literary and artistic thoughts and works that deviate from serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics, and to give them a resolute and thorough criticism, so as not to allow erroneous ideas to spread and poison the people.

To adhere to the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, literary and artistic workers must take the revolutionary path, go deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the midst of the fiery struggles of the masses, undergo a thorough transformation, and shift their standpoint "to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat." Chairman Mao pointed out that the transformation of the standpoint and the change in feelings are the key to the transformation of the worldview.

Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line is a thoroughly revolutionary line. It points out the only correct path for the development of proletarian literature and art. The history of the past twenty-five years has proven that revolutionary literature and art, revolutionary literary criticism, and revolutionary mass literary and artistic movements have flourished and developed vigorously, and have been invincible wherever they have pointed their spears. For this reason, Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line has been fiercely attacked by class enemies both inside and outside the Party.

The biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, as well as a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles such as Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Shao Qianlin, maliciously attacked "The Talks." They used a two-faced tactic of one thing in public and another in private, and did everything they could to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, and stubbornly pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line.

The central slogan of this counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line is the "theory of all-people's literature and art." The "theory of all-people's literature and art" is not a new commodity; it is a rehash of the "super-class literature and art" peddled by Chiang Kai-shek's lackey, Liang Shiqiu. At that time, Chairman Mao pointed out with penetrating insight: "Although they advocate in words that literature and art are super-class, in reality they advocate bourgeois literature and art and oppose proletarian literature and art." The class essence of the "theory of all-people's literature and art" is exactly the same. They use the banner of "all-people" to actually serve the bourgeoisie and a small group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

This reactionary "theory of all-people's literature and art" is based on the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. It serves the counter-revolutionary revisionist political line of the "all-people's party" and the "all-people's state."

"All-people's literature and art" is to turn proletarian literature and art into bourgeois literature and art, and to create public opinion for the overthrow of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The "theory of all-people's literature and art" opposes singing the praises of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the workers, peasants, and soldiers occupying the stage of literature and art. China's Khrushchev, under the pretext of "technical strength" and "making people happy," openly advocated performing the decadent and licentious life of feudal emperors in "The Story of Mei Long Town" and singing the praises of traitors in "The Four Generals Visit Their Mother." Zhou Yang and his ilk also advocated writing about "intermediate characters," which in reality meant writing about those who engage in speculation, "three selfs and one package," and stubbornly take the capitalist road.

The "theory of all-people's literature and art" opposes the literary and artistic circles waging a struggle against the bourgeoisie and all rotten things. The creators of the "theory of all-people's literature and art" put forward the so-called "very broad" slogan of "unity" that eliminates struggle. This slogan is to not distinguish between classes, to not distinguish between flowers and weeds, to unite everything, and to mix fish and dragons. This slogan is to make the proletariat lay down the banner of revolutionary criticism in front of the bourgeoisie, bow down to bourgeois literature and art, and surrender to bourgeois reactionary "authorities." The biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party even proposed that "for counter-revolutionary literary and artistic works that carry out capitalist restoration, we should not use the method of struggle."

The "theory of all-people's literature and art" opposes literary and artistic workers combining with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and transforming their worldview. They use riding in cars to "go down and have a look" to replace going deep among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and engaging in long-term, arduous ideological transformation in the midst of fiery class struggles. China's Khrushchev slandered those writers who truly combined with the workers, peasants, and soldiers as "rustic writers," who "only understand things about the common people"; while he praised those who supposedly "understand" "Swan Lake," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and "The Little Mermaid" as "foreign writers." In fact, "understanding things about the common people" is not easy, and for revolutionary literary and artistic workers and all revolutionary comrades, this is the most important thing. Those who despise the "common people" and "things about the common people" and pretend to be experts, praising those who supposedly "understand" "Swan Lake," "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and "The Little Mermaid" are merely paving the way for capitalist and revisionist literature and art.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line supported by the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party serves the counter-revolutionary revisionist political line and serves the restoration of capitalism.

Restoration and counter-restoration are the main content of class struggle throughout the historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The overthrown exploiting classes, in order to seize back their lost power, use various tricks and adopt various forms of struggle. Literature and art are extremely important tools they use to carry out restoration activities.

Under the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line, the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles recruited and colluded, formed cliques, and elevated all kinds of spiritual aristocrats, reactionary "authorities," revolutionary pests, and counter-revolutionaries to the heavens, turning many literary and artistic institutions into "organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary." They usurped the leadership of the literary and artistic circles, occupied key positions, issued orders, acted tyrannically, and behaved arrogantly, seizing our power.

Under this line, they used newspapers, magazines, stages, and screens to produce and release a large number of poisonous weeds, attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, attacking the great Chinese Communist Party, attacking the socialist system, attacking the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes; erecting monuments for great schemers, defending party-splitters, right-opportunists, beautifying traitors, collaborators, and the Nationalist reactionaries, and inciting landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to take class revenge.

All of this, in a nutshell, is to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and to create public opinion for the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party to usurp the Party, the army, and political power, and to restore capitalism.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly issued stern political warnings to Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and their clique. In 1964, Chairman Mao solemnly pointed out: "These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones), for fifteen years, have basically (not all people) not implemented the Party's policies, acted as officials and lords, and have not approached the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and have not reflected the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they do not undergo a thorough transformation, they will inevitably become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day." What is intolerable is that they and their backers have blocked, distorted, and altered Chairman Mao's instructions on criticizing reactionary literary and artistic theories and works, to the point of openly opposing them. They have suppressed and persecuted revolutionary literary and artistic workers who insist on Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line and who resolutely struggle against them.

Facts have proven that only through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line be truly implemented in all departments of literature and art. Now, the counter-revolutionary revisionists Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and their clique have been exposed, and the backstage of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line, China's Khrushchev, has also been exposed. This is a great political victory. This victory has cleared the way for the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, through the serious struggle of Comrade Jiang Qing and revolutionary literary and artistic workers, breaking through numerous obstacles, a batch of revolutionary Peking operas, revolutionary ballets, and revolutionary symphonies that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought have been produced. These works are highly combative and full of proletarian revolutionary heroism. They are model works that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are the jewels of the proletarian literary and artistic treasury and the treasures of human artistic history. They have reversed the historical inversion where emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties have ruled the stage for thousands of years. We are confident that through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, the literary and artistic front in our country will present a very brilliant and magnificent spectacle.

In commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must learn from and apply "The Talks" in the struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must further carry out the class struggle between the two lines on the literary and artistic front, launch a revolutionary criticism against the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, and against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and seize all the power they hold, including leadership organs, art schools, literary and artistic publications, and literary and artistic organizations, and put them in the hands of the proletariat. We must thoroughly criticize, expose, and condemn the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line and those bad plays, bad films, and bad works.

Revolutionary literary and artistic workers, all revolutionary comrades, let us follow Chairman Mao's teachings, undergo a thorough transformation of our worldview in the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and become steadfast proletarian revolutionary fighters. Let us, under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, defeat all the ideological consciousness of the exploiting classes, develop socialist new culture, and struggle to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat!

    为捍卫无产阶级专政而斗争
    ——纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第八期社论
    二十五年前，在文艺界的一场大论战、大斗争中，毛主席发表了划时代的天才著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。今天，在无产阶级文化大革命中，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，在彻底清算反革命修正主义文艺路线的战斗中，这部伟大著作进一步显示了它的无比强大的威力。
    《讲话》粉碎了形形色色的资产阶级反动文艺理论，对我国和世界无产阶级文艺运动的基本经验，作了最全面的科学总结，创造性地制定了最完整、最彻底、最正确的无产阶级文艺路线。它是无产阶级文艺理论的光辉典范，是马克思列宁主义世界观的新发展，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文献。
    在《讲话》中，毛主席深刻地系统地解决了文艺为工农兵服务的大方向问题。
    毛主席说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”究竟为千百万工农兵，还是为一小撮剥削阶级？为无产阶级，还是为资产阶级？这是无产阶级文艺同资产阶级文艺的分水岭；是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想文艺路线同反革命修正主义文艺路线斗争的焦点。
    文艺为工农兵服务，就是为工农兵的斗争需要服务，为工农兵的根本利益服务。而工农兵的斗争需要和根本利益，只有经过政治，才能集中地表现出来。政治，就是阶级斗争，就是夺取政权，巩固政权。因此，为工农兵服务，也就是为无产阶级的政治斗争服务，为无产阶级专政服务。
    坚持为工农兵服务的方向，就要求革命的文艺工作者，坚定地站在无产阶级立场上，满腔热情地歌颂人民，歌颂无产阶级，歌颂无产阶级专政，歌颂革命斗争，歌颂革命斗争中的英雄人物；无情地揭露敌人的丑恶嘴脸和肮脏灵魂，揭露资产阶级的反革命复辟阴谋；使每一出戏，每一首歌，每一部作品，都成为激励人民革命斗争的战鼓，刺向敌人心脏的钢刀。总之，正如毛主席所说：“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。”只有这样，文艺才能成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，成为无产阶级政治斗争，无产阶级专政的强大工具。
    坚持为工农兵服务的方向，就必须进行斗争，对于一切背离为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的文艺思想和文艺作品，统统给以坚决的深入的批判，决不能让谬种流传，毒害人民。
    坚持为工农兵服务的方向，文艺工作者一定要走革命化的道路，深入工农兵群众，在火热的群众斗争中，学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，学习社会，进行脱胎换骨的改造，把立足点“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来”。毛主席指出，立足点的转变，思想感情的变化，也就是世界观的改造，这是正确解决为什么人服务的关键。
    毛主席的文艺路线，是彻底革命的路线。它为无产阶级文艺的发展指出了唯一正确的道路。二十五年来的历史证明，按照毛主席指引的方向，革命的文艺，革命的文艺批评，革命的群众文艺运动，就欣欣向荣，蓬勃发展，锋芒指处，所向无敌。正因为这样，毛主席的文艺路线，遭到了党内外阶级敌人的疯狂攻击。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，以及文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍、田汉、邵荃麟等人，恶毒地攻击《讲话》。他们采取阴一套、阳一套的两面手法，千方百计地反对毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义的文艺路线。
    这条反革命修正主义文艺路线的中心口号，就是“全民文艺”论。“全民文艺”并不是什么新货色，它是蒋介石的御用文人梁实秋之流早就贩卖过的“超阶级文艺”的翻版。当时，毛主席一针见血地指出：“他们虽然在口头上提出什么文艺是超阶级的，但是他们在实际上是主张资产阶级的文艺，反对无产阶级的文艺的。”“全民文艺”论的阶级实质也完全是这样。他们打着“全民”的幌子，实际是为资产阶级服务，为一小撮地、富、反、坏、右服务。
    这个反动的“全民文艺”论，是根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“阶级斗争熄灭论”炮制出来的。它是为“全民党”、“全民国家”这条反革命修正主义的政治路线服务的。
  “全民文艺”就是把无产阶级文艺变成资产阶级文艺，为推翻无产阶级专政制造舆论。
    “全民文艺”论，反对歌颂工农兵，反对工农兵占领文艺舞台。中国的赫鲁晓夫借口“技术性强”能“使人高兴”，公开主张演出宣扬封建帝王糜烂色情生活的《梅龙镇》和歌颂叛徒的《四郎探母》等坏戏。周扬之流还宣扬写“中间人物”，实际上就是写那种搞投机倒把，搞“三自一包”，顽固地走资本主义道路的人物。
    “全民文艺”论，反对文艺界展开无产阶级向资产阶级和一切腐朽东西的斗争。“全民文艺”论的制造者们，提出取消斗争的所谓“非常广泛”的“团结”的口号。这个口号，就是不分阶级，不分香花毒草，一切联合，鱼龙混杂。这个口号，就是要无产阶级在资产阶级面前放下革命的批判的旗帜，向资产阶级文艺顶礼膜拜，向资产阶级反动“权威”屈膝投降。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，甚至提出，对搞资本主义复辟的反革命文艺作品，也“不要采取斗争的方法”。
    “全民文艺”论，反对文艺工作者同工农兵相结合，改造世界观。他们用坐汽车“下去看看”来代替深入工农兵群众，深入火热的阶级斗争，进行长期的、艰苦的思想改造。中国的赫鲁晓夫污蔑那些真正同工农兵打成一片的作家，是“土作家”，“只懂得关于老百姓的东西”；而吹捧所谓“懂得”《天鹅湖》、《巴黎圣母院》、《鱼美人》的“洋作家”。其实，“懂得关于老百姓的东西”是很不容易的，对于革命的文艺工作者和一切革命同志说来，这是最重要的东西。而卑视“老百姓”和“老百姓的东西”的某某人，冒充内行，吹捧“懂得”《天鹅湖》、《巴黎圣母院》、《鱼美人》的“洋作家”，不过是为资本主义、修正主义的文艺鸣锣开路罢了。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持的这条反革命修正主义的文艺路线，是为反革命修正主义政治路线服务的，是为资本主义复辟服务的。
    复辟和反复辟，是无产阶级专政整个历史时期的阶级斗争的主要内容。被打倒的剥削阶级，为了夺回他们失去的政权，施展种种阴谋诡计，采取各种斗争形式。文艺就是他们用来搞复辟活动的极其重要的工具。
    在反革命修正主义文艺路线统治下，文艺界的反革命修正主义分子，招降纳叛，结党营私，把那些乌七八糟的精神贵族、反动“权威”、革命蠹虫和反革命分子捧到九天之上，把许多文艺机关变成“象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体”。他们窃取了文艺界的领导权，盘踞要位，发号施令，横行霸道，飞扬跋扈，专了我们的政。
    在这条路线下，他们利用书报杂志，舞台银幕，炮制和放出大批毒草，攻击我们伟大的领袖毛主席，攻击伟大的中国共产党，攻击社会主义制度，攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社；为大野心家、大阴谋家树碑立传，为反党分子、右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，美化叛徒、汉奸和国民党反动派，煽动地富反坏右进行阶级报复。
    所有这一切，集中到一点，就是反对无产阶级专政，为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡军、篡政，复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    对陆定一、周扬及其一伙，毛主席多次提出过严厉的政治警告。一九六四年，毛主席严正地指出：“这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上
  （不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。”令人不能容忍的是，他们和他们的后台，对毛主席关于批判反动文艺理论和反动文艺作品的历次指示，肆无忌惮地进行封锁、歪曲、篡改，以至公开对抗。他们对坚持毛主席无产阶级文艺路线、同他们坚决斗争的江青同志，进行排挤和打击，对革命的文艺工作者进行压制和迫害。
    事实证明，只有经过无产阶级文化大革命，毛主席的文艺路线才能在文学艺术的各个部门里得到真正的贯彻。现在，已经把反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬一伙揪出来了，把反革命修正主义文艺路线的后台、中国的赫鲁晓夫也揪出来了。这是一个伟大的政治上的胜利。这个胜利，为毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线的贯彻，扫清了道路。
    在毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线指引下，经过江青同志、革命文艺工作者的严重斗争，冲破重重阻碍，已经产生了一批闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命京剧、革命芭蕾舞剧和革命交响音乐。这些作品具有强烈的战斗性，充满着无产阶级的革命英雄气概。这是为工农兵服务，为无产阶级专政服务的样板作品。这是无产阶级文艺宝库里的明珠，是人类艺术史上的珍品。它把几千年来帝王将相、才子佳人统治舞台的这种历史的颠倒，再颠倒过来了。我们坚信，经过无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线的光辉照耀下，我国文艺战线必将出现一个极其灿烂辉煌的景象。
    纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，我们一定要在斗争中活学活用《讲话》，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们要进一步开展文艺战线上两条路线的阶级斗争，向文艺界的反革命修正主义分子，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，开展革命的大批判，把他们所把持的领导机关、艺术学校、文艺刊物、文艺团体等一切权力，统统夺到无产阶级手里来。我们要把反革命修正主义文艺路线和那些坏戏、坏电影、坏作品批深、批透、批臭。
    革命的文艺工作者，一切革命的同志，让我们遵照毛主席的教导，在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动中，彻底改造自己的世界观，作一个坚定的无产阶级革命战士。让我们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指导下，战胜一切剥削阶级的意识形态，发展社会主义的新文化，为捍卫无产阶级专政而斗争！
