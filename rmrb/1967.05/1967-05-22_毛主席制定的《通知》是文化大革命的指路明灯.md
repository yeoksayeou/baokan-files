    Basutoland Congress Party Representative Hails the Publication of the CPC Central Committee's Notice
    The Notice Formulated by Chairman Mao is the Beacon for the Cultural Revolution
    The Decisive Victory of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is Also a Victory for the Oppressed People of the World

    CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) — Maphafeni, representative of the Basutoland Congress Party in Cairo, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter on May 19, enthusiastically hailing the publication of the May 16, 1966 Notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, personally directed by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao.

    He said: "This Notice, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, is the most important directive for the proletarian cultural revolution. It keeps the people vigilant and smashes the revisionist program that attempts to restore capitalism in China."

    He said, acknowledging Chairman Mao's theory that class struggle exists in socialist society is a prerequisite for waging a struggle against capitalism and all reactionaries in socialist countries. The proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, ensures the continued advancement of the Chinese revolution and the prevention of the restoration of capitalism in China.

    This Basutoland freedom fighter went on to say that the experience of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution is not only important for the Chinese people but also for the revolutionary people of all countries.

    He said, in the Soviet Union, a group of revisionists usurped power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique betrayed the Soviet people and the oppressed people of other countries who are still fighting for liberation. The Soviet revisionist clique, after seizing power, suppresses the working people at home and engages in "peaceful coexistence" with imperialist exploiters abroad.

    He said: "Exposing and rooting out the Khrushchev in China is a decisive victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a decisive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. This is not only a decisive victory for the Chinese people but also for the oppressed people of the whole world."

    巴苏陀兰大会党代表欢呼中共中央《通知》的公开发表
    毛主席制定的《通知》是文化大革命的指路明灯
    中国文化大革命的决定性胜利也是全世界被压迫人民的胜利
    新华社开罗十九日电　巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代表马帕法尼十九日向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的公开发表。
    他说：“这个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的《通知》，是无产阶级文化大革命的最重要的指示，它使人民保持警惕性，粉碎了企图在中国复辟资本主义的修正主义纲领。”
    他说，承认毛主席的关于在社会主义社会中存在阶级和阶级斗争的这一学说，是在社会主义国家中开展反对资本主义和一切反动派的斗争的前提。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命保证了中国革命继续向前发展和资本主义不会在中国复辟。
    这位巴苏陀兰自由战士接着说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的经验不仅对中国人民是重要的，而且对各国革命人民来说，也是重要的。
    他说，在苏联，一批修正主义分子篡夺了政权，把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政。苏联修正主义统治集团背叛了苏联人民和其他仍在进行解放斗争的各国被压迫人民。苏修集团篡夺了政权，在国内镇压劳动人民，在国外同帝国主义剥削者搞“和平共处”。
    他说：“揭露和揪出中国的赫鲁晓夫，是毛泽东思想的决定性胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。这不仅是中国人民也是全世界被压迫人民的决定性胜利。”
