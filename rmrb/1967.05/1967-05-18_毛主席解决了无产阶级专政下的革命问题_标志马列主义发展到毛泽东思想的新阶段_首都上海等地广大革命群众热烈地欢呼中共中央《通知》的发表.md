Chairman Mao has solved the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, marking the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary masses in the capital, Shanghai, and other places enthusiastically hail the issuance of the Central Committee's notice.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, revolutionary masses in the capital enthusiastically welcome the issuance of the Central Committee's notice. They pointed out that the notice, personally directed by our great leader Chairman Mao, is a major event in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a major event in the international communist movement. We must seriously study and discuss this brilliant Marxist-Leninist document of great historical significance. They said: This notice exposes the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party once again and drags out the head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, to be publicly condemned. This is the greatest encouragement and strongest support from our great leader Chairman Mao to the revolutionary masses of the nation and the capital. They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of this great document, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses in the cultural, educational, news, literary, and publishing sectors in the capital held meetings and discussions after the notice was issued, and joyfully took to the streets in parades. They carried portraits of Chairman Mao, sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, beat drums and gongs, and surged to the location of the Central Committee to send joyous reports, congratulatory letters, and letters of respect to Chairman Mao, the Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" They hailed the glorious, great, and correct Communist Party of China! They hailed the first anniversary of the establishment of the Central Cultural Revolution Group!

The Beijing Daily published an editorial titled "Overthrow Peng Zhen" on the 17th, calling on revolutionary masses throughout the city to remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy to the end, do not seek fame like the King of Chu." Continue to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating a fallen enemy, and aim all guns at the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen and their supporters, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. Launch a more thorough, broader, and deeper exposure, criticism, and struggle, thoroughly overthrow, smash, and disgrace them! Make sure they never rise again!

Comrade Xu Kai, a standing committee member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the Beijing Revolutionary Workers' Congress, said: Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle for power. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party are terrified and hateful of the cultural revolution, and at the beginning of the movement, they practiced bourgeois dictatorship over the revolutionary masses, attempting to extinguish the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, labeling us as "counter-revolutionaries," because they still held "power." Under Chairman Mao's leadership, we proletarian revolutionaries have broken through countless obstacles, overcome a thousand hardships, and dragged out the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen for public condemnation, seizing all the party, government, financial, and cultural powers of Beijing. The power of the proletariat must forever be in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, and only then can the socialist mountains and rivers remain unchanged. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has solved a problem that no one before in the international communist movement has solved, illuminating the path of world revolution, and making the dream of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries to restore capitalism in China completely shattered. Members of the Revolutionary Committee and the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory, and the Cultural Revolution Preparatory Committee, in conjunction with the current situation, studied the notice. They decided to further unite the majority of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres, seize power well, use power well, and also hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, aiming at the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen, and open fire fiercely.

Some standing committee members of the Beijing Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Representative Assembly studied and discussed the Central Committee's notice. They said, the publication of this notice is excellent! It greatly boosts the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and greatly dampens the spirit of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party! We poor and lower-middle peasants fully support it and wholeheartedly approve it! Over a thousand revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasant representatives participating in the political work conference in Pinggu County also collectively studied the Central Committee's notice.

After the Central Committee's notice was posted at Peking University, where the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country was posted, the entire school was in jubilation. They held a celebration meeting and a discussion meeting that night, enthusiastically hailing the great victory of the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao. Song Yixiu and Zhao Zhengyi, who participated in writing the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism in the country, said with great emotion, our big-character poster was born under the inspiration and guidance of the notice. They said, without the notice, there would be no such big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism; without Mao Zedong Thought, without Chairman Mao's support, there would be nothing for the proletarian revolutionaries.

The soldiers of the "Jinggangshan" Brigade at Tsinghua University emphasized: In the past year, our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved brilliant victories, and the power usurped by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party has been seized back by the proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought! We proletarian revolutionaries must firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high, forever fly high!

The Red Guards of the "Jinggangshan" Commune at Beijing Normal University said: Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of state power. After the proletariat seizes power, no matter how complicated things are, we must not forget the direction and lose the center, and must not forget proletarian dictatorship. The Central Committee's notice exposes the counter-revolutionary revisionist face of Peng Zhen and also exposes the ugly counter-revolutionary revisionist face of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, the Khrushchev-like figures sleeping by our side. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has dragged out these people along with their tentacles reaching into various fields, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers of the "Thoroughly Smash the Old Beijing Municipal Committee Combat Corps" wrote a proclamation overnight after hearing the Central Committee's notice, exposing and denouncing the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen and their backstage boss—the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party—against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought, and held a mobilization meeting.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Shanghai, Taiyuan, Harbin, Jinan, Guiyang, and other places enthusiastically welcome the issuance of the Central Committee's notice and enthusiastically hail the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year. Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in various places said, this great historical document personally directed by Chairman Mao shatters the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen's attempt to realize the restoration of capitalism and systematically proposes the theory, line, policy, and direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is our guiding light for carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and consolidating and developing the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must seriously study the Central Committee's notice, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and combine the great criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own regions and units. In the great criticism and struggle, promote the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," grasp the revolution, promote production, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

In the birthplace of the "January Revolution" in Shanghai, today's main streets are adorned with bright red joyous reports; in many factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, filled with deep affection for the great teacher Chairman Mao, gather around portraits of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, and enthusiastically celebrate the issuance of this document of great historical significance. They excitedly shouted: "Long live the victorious revolutionary line of the proletariat of Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our red sun, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary Red Guards in Shanghai reviewed the past year's battle course and deeply felt that our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao's foresight is brilliant and correct. This great Marxist-Leninist document of epoch-making significance personally directed by Chairman Mao is the guiding light for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to advance from victory to victory. They repeatedly studied this great document and deeply understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power." The leading members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Shanghai Ink Factory said: The "Report Outline" concocted by Peng Zhen under the support of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party is a counter-revolutionary program of the bourgeoisie's counterattack against the proletariat. If this extremely reactionary outline were realized, it would change the color of the mountains and rivers of our socialist motherland, and the country would face the restoration of capitalism! Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of this great notice of great significance, shattering their conspiracy, and giving us proletarian revolutionaries a powerful ideological weapon. After a year of arduous struggle, we finally dragged out the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, which is a great victory. The Red Guards of East China Normal University enthusiastically hailed the issuance of the notice and solemnly vowed: Follow Chairman Mao closely and carry out thorough revolution.

The heads of various departments, commissions, and offices of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee today collectively studied and discussed the Central Committee's notice. Everyone unanimously agreed that the issuance of this notice is a major event in the political life of the nation, the greatest encouragement and support for the proletarian revolutionaries. They said, the so-called "Report Outline" concocted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen and supported by the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party is a thorough program for the restoration of capitalism against Mao Zedong Thought and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our most, most great leader Chairman Mao personally directed and formulated the Central Committee's notice, shattering the counter-revolutionary revisionist conspiracy of restoration, and sounding the bugle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to advance to victory. Over the past year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the people of the nation have dragged out the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the party, government, army, and cultural circles, and also dragged out their backstage boss—the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in Taiyuan held discussion meetings, and Comrade Xu Chunshi, a member of the Taiyuan Municipal Core Group of the Communist Party, said: The issuance of this notice by the Central Committee has extremely profound historical significance and will certainly mobilize the masses more broadly and deeply, overthrow, smash, and overthrow the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, and achieve greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Twenty thousand red rebels and revolutionary masses in Harbin held a grand rally this morning to celebrate the issuance of the Central Committee's notice. The broad masses of red rebels, facing the rising sun, carried the radiant portrait of Chairman Mao, gathered at the People's Grand Hall Square. The representative of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee said at the meeting that the Central Committee's notice shines with the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought. This great document thoroughly exposes the anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought evil conspiracy of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. Under the guidance and inspiration of this document, the proletarian revolutionaries of Heilongjiang Province have dragged out the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party and achieved a great victory in the struggle for power. However, it should be seen that the poison of the so-called "Five-Person Group's Report Outline" is widespread, and all red rebels in the province must continue to wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly overthrow, smash, and overthrow this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and eliminate their poison. Worker representatives, peasant representatives, and Red Guard representatives all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to thoroughly overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Some leaders of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a discussion after the issuance of the Central Committee's notice. They said, the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year fully prove the foresight and correctness of our great leader Chairman Mao's predictions a year ago in the notice. Now, the Khrushchev of China sleeping by Chairman Mao's side has been dragged out, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party has been dragged out, and big and small capitalist-roaders in the party have been dragged out. The dream of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries to carry out "peaceful evolution" and restore capitalism in China has been shattered, and our proletarian dictatorship has been further consolidated. This is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

These leaders said, after the proletarian revolutionaries achieved victory in the struggle for power, the struggle between the two classes and the two lines is still very sharp and complex, and the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party are still plotting counter-revolutionary seizures of power to achieve the restoration of capitalism. The task of struggle for the proletarian revolutionaries is still very heavy. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously study the notice, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, eliminate their poison in Shandong, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our own regions and departments, and carry the cultural revolution through to the end.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries in Qingdao expressed their determination to never forget class struggle and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, to combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Revolutionary masses in the Guiyang region enthusiastically welcome the issuance of the Central Committee's notice, which shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Li Li, a standing committee member of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee, former secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee, and governor of the province, said: The so-called "Report Outline" of the "Five-Person Group" is a poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought, concocted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen under the support of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. We must thoroughly criticize this reactionary outline politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and thoroughly criticize and overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party who support him from behind. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the province, respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," learn from the PLA, "grasp revolution and promote production," and combine the criticism of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our province, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party in Guizhou!

    毛主席解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题
    标志马列主义发展到毛泽东思想的新阶段
    首都上海等地广大革命群众热烈地欢呼中共中央《通知》的发表
    据新华社十七日讯　首都广大革命群众热烈欢呼中共中央《通知》的发表。他们指出，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的这个《通知》，是我国无产阶级文化大革命中的一个重大事件，是国际共产主义运动中的一个重大事件。我们一定要认真学习和讨论这一具有伟大历史意义的马克思列宁主义的光辉文件。他们说：这个《通知》把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派又一次揭露出来示众，把旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的头子彭真揪出来示众，这是伟大领袖毛主席对全国和首都革命群众最大的鼓舞和最有力的支持。他们表示，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在这个伟大文件的指导下，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    首都革命职工、贫下中农、革命师生、革命干部和文化、教育、新闻、文艺、出版等部门的革命群众在《通知》发表后，纷纷集会座谈，欢欣鼓舞地走上街头游行。他们抬着毛主席画像，高唱着毛主席语录歌，敲锣打鼓涌到党中央所在地，向毛主席、党中央，以及中央文化革命小组送喜报、贺信和致敬信。他们一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”欢呼光荣、伟大、正确的中国共产党！欢呼中央文化革命小组成立一周年！
    《北京日报》十七日发表了题为《打倒彭真》的社论，号召全市革命群众，牢记毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”继续高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，枪口一致对准以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和支持他们的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。开展更充分、更广泛、更深入的大揭露、大批判、大斗争，彻底把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！叫他们永世不得翻身！
    北京市革命委员会常委、北京市革命职工代表会议常委徐凯说：毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级文化大革命，就是一场你死我活的夺权斗争。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对文化大革命怕得要死，恨得要命，在去年运动刚开始时，他们对革命群众实行资产阶级专政，妄图扑灭无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，把我们打成“反革命”，就是因为他们还掌握着“权”。我们无产阶级革命派在毛主席的领导下，冲破重重阻力，战胜千重困难，把以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团揪出来示众了，把北京市的党、政、财、文大权统统夺过来了。无产阶级的权只有永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手中，社会主义江山才能永不变色。毛主席亲自发动并领导的无产阶级文化大革命，解决了国际共产主义运动中前人所没有解决的问题，照亮了世界革命的前进道路，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派妄想在中国复辟资本主义的美梦彻底破产了。北京第二机床厂革命委员会和革命造反总部、文革筹委会的成员，结合当前形势，学习了《通知》。他们决心更进一步地团结大多数的革命工人，革命干部，掌好权，用好权，并且高举革命的批判旗帜，对准党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，猛烈开火。
    北京市贫下中农代表会议部分常委学习和讨论了中共中央的《通知》。他们说，这个《通知》的公开发表，好得很！大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的威风！我们贫下中农，一千个拥护，一万个赞成！正在参加平谷县政治工作会议的革命干部和贫下中农代表一千多人，也集体学习了中共中央的《通知》。
    中共中央《通知》在贴出全国第一张马列主义大字报的北京大学广播以后，全校革命师生一片欢腾。他们在当天晚上就举行了庆祝大会和座谈会，热烈欢呼以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。参加写作全国第一张马列主义大字报的作者宋一秀、赵正义同志怀着无限激动的心情说，我们的大字报就是在《通知》的鼓舞和指导下诞生的。他们说，没有《通知》就没有这一张马列主义大字报；没有毛泽东思想，没有毛主席的支持，就没有无产阶级革命派的一切。
    清华大学“井冈山”兵团的战士们强调说：一年来，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得辉煌胜利，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺的权，被用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派夺回来了！我们无产阶级革命派，一定要大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，要让毛泽东思想伟大红旗高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    北京师范大学“井冈山”公社的红卫兵们说：毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级在夺取政权以后，无论怎样千头万绪，决不能忘记了方向，失掉了中心，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。党中央的《通知》，揭露了反革命修正主义分子彭真的面目，也揭露了睡在我们身旁的赫鲁晓夫式人物、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义丑恶嘴脸。无产阶级文化大革命把这些家伙连同他们伸向各个领域的爪牙揪了出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    “彻底摧毁旧北京市委战斗兵团”的战士们，听了中共中央的《通知》后，连夜写出了揭发和声讨彭真反革命修正主义集团和他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行的檄文，并举行了誓师大会。
    据新华社十七日讯　上海、太原、哈尔滨、济南、贵阳等地广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众热烈欢呼中共中央《通知》的发表，热烈欢呼无产阶级文化大革命一年来取得的伟大胜利。各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众说，毛主席亲自主持制定的这一伟大的历史文件，粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团妄图实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，系统地提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。它是我们进行无产阶级文化大革命，巩固和发展无产阶级专政的指路明灯。我们一定要认真学习中共中央的《通知》，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判同本地区、本单位的斗、批、改紧密结合起来，在大批判、大斗争中促进无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”，抓好革命，促好生产，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在“一月革命”风暴发源地的上海，今天主要街道两旁张贴了鲜红的欢呼喜报；许多工厂企业、机关、学校里，无产阶级革命派和革命群众，满怀对伟大导师毛主席无限热爱的深厚感情，簇拥着毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，热烈地庆祝这一具有重大历史意义的文件的发表。他们激动地高呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    上海无产阶级革命派和革命的红卫兵小将，回顾了近一年来的战斗历程，特别深刻地感受到，我们伟大统帅毛主席预见的英明和正确。毛主席亲自主持制定的这一伟大的具有划时代意义的马克思列宁主义的光辉文件，是指导无产阶级文化大革命从胜利走向胜利的指路明灯。他们一遍又一遍地学习这一伟大文件，更深刻地体会到毛主席教导的“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权”的伟大意义。上海油墨厂革命委员会领导成员说：彭真在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持下炮制出的《汇报提纲》，是资产阶级向无产阶级反扑的反革命纲领。如果这个极其反动的提纲得以实现，将使社会主义祖国的山河变色，全国就要出现资本主义复辟！伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定了具有伟大意义的《通知》，粉碎了他们的阴谋，给我们无产阶级革命派以极其强大的思想武器，通过一年的艰苦斗争，终于把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来，这是一个伟大的胜利。华东师范大学红卫兵小将们热烈欢呼《通知》的发表，他们庄严地宣誓：紧紧跟着毛主席，彻底闹革命。
    山西省革命委员会各部、委、办公室负责人，今天集体学习和讨论了中共中央的《通知》。大家一致认为，发表这个《通知》，是全国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事，是对无产阶级革命派最大的鼓舞、最大的支持。他们说，反革命修正主义分子彭真一手炮制的并受到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持的所谓《汇报提纲》，是反对毛泽东思想、反对无产阶级专政的彻头彻尾的复辟资本主义的纲领。我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自主持和制定的中共中央的《通知》，粉碎了反革命修正主义的复辟阴谋，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命胜利进军的号角。一年来，全国人民在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，揪出了混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化界的资产阶级代表人物，也揪出了他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    太原市广大无产阶级革命派纷纷举行座谈会，中共太原市核心小组成员续纯实说：中共中央发表这个《通知》，有着极其深远的历史意义，一定会更加广泛、更加深入地发动群众，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大胜利。
    哈尔滨市二十万红色造反者和革命群众，今天上午举行了庆祝中共中央《通知》发表的隆重集会。广大红色造反者斗志昂扬，迎着初升的朝阳，抬着光芒四射的毛主席画像，齐集人民大厦广场。黑龙江省革命委员会代表在会上讲话说，中共中央的《通知》，放射着伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。这个伟大文件彻底揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪恶阴谋。在这个文件指引和鼓舞下，黑龙江省的无产阶级革命派把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来了，取得了夺权斗争的伟大胜利。但是应该看到所谓“五人小组”的《汇报提纲》流毒甚广，我们全省红色造反者必须继续奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，并肃清他们散布的流毒。工人代表、农民代表、红卫兵代表都在会上讲了话。他们一致表示，决心把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗臭、斗倒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    山东省革命委员会一些负责人在中共中央的《通知》发表以后，立即进行了座谈讨论。他们说，一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，完全证明了伟大领袖毛主席一年以前在《通知》中的英明正确的预言。现在，睡在毛主席身旁的中国的赫鲁晓夫被揪出来了，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派被揪出来了，大大小小的党内走资本主义道路的当权派被揪出来了。帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派妄图在中国进行“和平演变”、实现资本主义复辟的幻梦破产了，我们的无产阶级专政更加巩固了，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    这些负责人说，无产阶级革命派取得了夺权斗争胜利以后，两个阶级、两条路线的斗争仍然十分尖锐复杂，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，还在阴谋策划反夺权，实现资本主义复辟。无产阶级革命派的斗争任务仍然十分繁重。我们必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，认真学习《通知》，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，肃清他们在山东的流毒，搞好本地区、本部门的斗、批、改，把文化大革命进行到底。
    青岛市广大无产阶级革命派表示，一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    贵阳地区无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的中共中央《通知》的发表。贵州省革命委员会常委、原贵州省委书记处书记、省长李立说：所谓“五人小组”的《汇报提纲》，是反革命修正主义分子彭真在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派支持下抛出的。这个《汇报提纲》竭力对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，是彻头彻尾的反毛泽东思想的大毒草。我们一定要把这个反动提纲从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，把反革命修正主义分子彭真和背后支持他的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派批臭批倒。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在全省掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，大学解放军，“抓革命，促生产”，要把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的批判与本省的斗、批、改结合起来，彻底肃清党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在贵州的一切流毒！
