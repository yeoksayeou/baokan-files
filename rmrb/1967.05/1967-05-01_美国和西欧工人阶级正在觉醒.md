The working class in the U.S. and Western Europe is gradually breaking free from the influence of monopolistic capital's controlled unions and modern revisionism, actively engaging in political struggles.

Since the beginning of this year, the working class in Spain has launched an unprecedented scale of political strikes to oppose the fascist rule of Franco. In late January, workers in Madrid, under the leadership of the secret underground organization "Workers' Committees," fought alongside students in the streets of Madrid for four consecutive days against the police. They protested the arrest of their class brothers by Franco and demanded the freedom to organize unions. Under their tenacious struggle, the strike wave spread across the country.

The failure of U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, with its heavy casualties and enormous war expenses, has led to intensified domestic class contradictions as the U.S. increases conscription and taxation, exploiting and oppressing the people. The U.S.'s savage invasion of Vietnam has further enraged the American and Western European peoples. The struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam has spread across North America and Western Europe. The working class in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe is a crucial force in this struggle.

Meanwhile, as the economic crisis approaches, the monopolistic capital in the U.S. and Western Europe is intensifying its attacks on the working class and other laboring people. The struggle against monopolistic capital shifting the economic crisis onto the working class has become an important part of the workers' fight in the U.S. and Western Europe.

The struggle of American workers for wage increases, reduced working hours, and against unjust layoffs has been ongoing for the past half-year. At the beginning of this year, 5,000 transportation workers in Philadelphia, the fourth-largest city in the U.S., went on a major strike. Simultaneously, 10,000 teachers in Chicago demanded wage increases. Following this, tugboat workers and elevator workers in New York went on a general strike.

In Western Europe, workers in countries like Britain, France, and Italy have launched unprecedented struggles against the exploitation and reactionary rule of monopolistic capital. Recently, a strike by 10,000 train drivers in France, 15,000 railway workers in Britain, and 40,000 railway workers in Italy brought the railway transportation in these countries to a standstill. The massive strike by 100,000 metallurgical and chemical workers in Lyon, France, and the several nationwide strikes by 200,000 food workers, 350,000 textile workers, and 150,000 hosiery workers in Italy, have been rare in the history of Western European strike movements in terms of scale and participation.

    美国和西欧工人阶级正在觉醒
    美国和西欧的工人阶级，正在逐渐摆脱垄断资本的御用工会和现代修正主义的影响，积极地投入政治斗争。
    西班牙工人阶级今年年初以来，为反对佛朗哥法西斯统治而展开了空前规模的政治性的罢工斗争。马德里的工人一月底在秘密的地下组织“工人委员会”领导下，同大学生一道，在马德里街头连续四天同警察进行搏斗，抗议佛朗哥逮捕他们的阶级兄弟，要求组织工会的自由。在他们的顽强斗争的影响下，罢工浪潮扩展到全国。
    美帝国主义侵越战争失败，伤亡惨重，战争开支浩大，在国内加紧征兵征税，剥削和压迫人民，使美国国内阶级矛盾日趋尖锐化。美帝对越南的野蛮侵略，更激起了美国人民和西欧人民的强烈愤慨。反对美国侵略越南的群众斗争，遍及北美和西欧。美国、加拿大和西欧的工人阶级，是这个斗争中的重要力量。
    同时，随着经济危机的迫近，美国和西欧的垄断资本正在加紧进攻工人阶级和其他劳动人民。反对垄断资本把经济危机转嫁到工人阶级身上，成为美国和西欧工人斗争的一个重要内容。
    美国工人要求增加工资、减少工作时间、反对资方无理解雇的斗争，半年来连绵不断。今年年初，美国第四大城市费城发生了五千名运输工人的大罢工。与此同时，芝加哥的一万名教师要求增加工资。接着纽约拖船工人和电梯工人举行总罢工。
    在西欧，英国、法国、意大利等国的工人进行了规模空前的反对垄断资本的剥削和反动统治的斗争。不久前法国一万名火车司机的罢工，英国一万五千名铁路工人的罢工，意大利四万铁路工人的罢工，使这些国家绝大部分的铁路交通陷于瘫痪。法国里昂市十万名冶金和化学工人的大罢工，意大利二十万食品工人、三十五万纺织工人和十五万袜厂工人的几次全国性罢工，其声势之大和参加人数之多，都是历年来西欧罢工运动中少见的。
