I am filled with immense excitement as I enthusiastically hail the publication of the May 16, 1966, Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the article "A Great Historical Document" by the editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*. I also enthusiastically congratulate the Central Cultural Revolution Group on its first anniversary and the glorious victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year.

The Circular is a brilliant document personally directed by our great leader Chairman Mao, and it is a great battle program. The revolutionary masses of the Taoyuan No. 1-26 Textile Factory are determined to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the guidance of this great document, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, focus on the principal contradiction, and carry the revolution through to the end!

The great historical document personally directed by Chairman Mao creatively develops Marxism-Leninism and solves the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the class struggle is concentrated on the question of power, that is, the proletariat must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In the past, people often thought that after the proletariat seized power, the problem of power was solved, and the main task of the revolution was to engage in construction, production, and cultural development; they did not realize that the power already seized by the proletariat could be taken back by the bourgeoisie, that the proletariat could lose power, and that the dictatorship of the proletariat could turn into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The bitter historical fact of the Khrushchev revisionist clique seizing the party and the country and leading the first socialist country in the world, the Soviet Union, down the path of capitalist restoration, tells us that in socialist countries, there is still a struggle between two classes and two roads. If things are not handled properly, capitalist restoration can happen at any time. We must never forget this.

In recent years, our great leader Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out: We must be vigilant against revisionism, especially against revisionism in the central leadership. In this great historical document personally directed by Chairman Mao, it is clearly pointed out: "The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have been exposed by us, some have not, and some are still being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as Khrushchev. They are now sleeping beside us. All levels of party committees must pay full attention to this."

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a struggle to prevent counter-revolutionary revisionists from seizing leadership, to prevent the dictatorship of the proletariat from turning into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and to prevent capitalist restoration.

In the great practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dared to struggle and dared to rebel, exposing the Khrushchev-like figures sleeping beside Chairman Mao, exposing a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and exposing all kinds of bourgeois representatives. They have thoroughly smashed the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, and have swept away the filth left over from old society; they have established the new ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the proletariat, and the spiritual face of the whole society is undergoing tremendous changes.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a life-and-death struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road, a struggle between the proletariat's consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie's attempt to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. In this extremely fierce, sharp, profound, and complex class struggle, we proletarian revolutionaries have further realized that since classes exist in a socialist society, class struggle is unavoidable; we have further understood the extreme importance of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat; and we have further deeply felt the great and far-reaching significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the inevitable development of class struggle within the country, the inevitable development of the socialist revolution, the broadest, deepest, and richest class struggle in history, and the greatest revolution to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and ensure that the party and the state do not change color.

In July 1964, when Chairman Mao discussed the issue of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, he taught us to guard against the repetition of Khrushchev revisionism in China and proposed that the first condition for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is that "they must be genuine Marxists-Leninists, not revisionists like Khrushchev who hang out the sign of Marxism-Leninism." We proletarian revolutionaries must remember Chairman Mao's great teaching, never forget that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat in the midst of countless affairs. Class struggle is long-term. After defeating a group of bourgeois representatives, new bourgeois representatives will emerge. We must not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will ensure lasting peace. We must always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat; always remember to emphasize politics. We must temper and improve ourselves in the storms of class struggle. In the class struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought to break down private interests and establish public interests, and reform our worldview. We must firmly grasp and use the power we have seized from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. Let the red empire of the proletariat remain red forever, red to the end, and never change color for generations to come. Long live the red empire of the proletariat!

    无产阶级的红色江山万岁
    山西省革命委员会委员  太原一·二六纺织厂工人  解悦
    我怀着无比激动的心情，最最热烈地欢呼中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和《红旗》杂志编辑部、《人民日报》编辑部文章《伟大的历史文件》的发表，最最热烈地祝贺中央文革小组成立一周年和无产阶级文化大革命一年来取得的辉煌胜利。
    《通知》是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的光辉文件，是伟大的战斗纲领。我们太原一·二六纺织厂的无产阶级革命派决心在这个伟大文件的指导下，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，抓住主要矛盾，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席亲自主持制定的这个伟大的历史文件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政下的革命问题。在无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。
    过去，人们往往认为，无产阶级在夺取了政权以后，政权问题就已经解决了，革命的主要任务就是搞建设，抓生产，提高文化了；没有认识到，无产阶级已经取得的政权，还可能被资产阶级夺过去，无产阶级还可能丧失政权，无产阶级专政还可能变为资产阶级专政。
    赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团篡党篡国，使世界上第一个社会主义国家苏联走上资本主义复辟的道路，这个严酷的历史事实告诉人们，在社会主义国家仍然存在着两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。我们千万不能忘记这一点。
    近几年，我们的伟大领袖毛主席多次提出：要警惕出修正主义，特别是要警惕在中央出修正主义。在毛主席亲自主持制定的这个伟大的历史文件中，明确指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，正是防止反革命修正主义分子篡夺领导权的斗争，防止无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政的斗争，防止资本主义复辟的斗争。
    在一年来的文化大革命的伟大实践中，亿万革命群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，敢斗争、敢造反，把睡在毛主席身边的赫鲁晓夫式的人物挖出来了，把一批反革命修正主义分子挖出来了，把形形色色的资产阶级代表人物挖出来了。大破剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，荡涤旧社会遗留下来的污泥浊水；大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，整个社会的精神面貌正在发生巨大变化。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是社会主义道路同资本主义道路你死我活的斗争，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政同资产阶级要变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的斗争。在这场极其激烈、极其尖锐、极其深刻又极其复杂的阶级斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派更进一步认识到，在社会主义社会里既然存在着阶级，因此阶级斗争是避免不了的；更加懂得了巩固无产阶级专政的极端重要性；更加深刻地体会到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大深远意义。无产阶级文化大革命是国内阶级斗争的必然发展，是社会主义革命的必然发展，是历史上最广泛的、最深刻的也是最丰富的阶级斗争，是巩固无产阶级专政，保证党和国家不变颜色的最伟大的革命。
    一九六四年七月，毛主席在讲无产阶级革命事业接班人问题的时候，教导我们要防止赫鲁晓夫修正主义在中国重演，提出无产阶级革命事业接班人的第一个条件就是“他们必须是真正的马克思列宁主义者，而不是象赫鲁晓夫那样的挂着马克思列宁主义招牌的修正主义者。”我们无产阶级革命派要牢记毛主席这个伟大教导，千万不要忘记革命的根本问题是政权问题，千万不要在千头万绪的事务中忘记了无产阶级专政。阶级斗争是长期的。打倒了一批资产阶级代表人物，还会有新的资产阶级代表人物登台表演。我们一定“不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。”我们要念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政；念念不忘突出政治。我们一定要在阶级斗争的风浪中，锻炼自己，提高自己。在阶级斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想破私立公，改造世界观。把我们从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回来的权，牢牢地掌好、用好。让无产阶级的红色江山永远红下去，红到底，千秋万代永不变色。无产阶级的红色江山万岁！
