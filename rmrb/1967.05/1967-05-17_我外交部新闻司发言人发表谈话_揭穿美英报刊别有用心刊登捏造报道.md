According to foreign news reports, the U.S. newspaper *Chicago Daily News* and the British newspaper *Daily Sketch* published on May 14 and 15, respectively, an article by Simon Malley, the correspondent of the Tunisian weekly *Jeune Afrique* at the United Nations, supposedly about his conversation with Premier Zhou Enlai.

The spokesperson of the Press Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued the following statement regarding this matter:

Simon Malley, as a transit passenger, arrived in Beijing from Cambodia on March 27 this year and left Beijing on March 29 to go to France via the Soviet Union. During the two days Simon Malley stayed in Beijing, Premier Zhou Enlai or any other Chinese leader such as Comrade Chen Boda, Chen Yi, or Yang Chengwu did not meet with him. The aforementioned reports in U.S. and British newspapers are completely fabricated with malicious intent.

    我外交部新闻司发言人发表谈话
    揭穿美英报刊别有用心刊登捏造报道
    新华社十六日讯　据外电报道，美国《芝加哥每日新闻》和英国《每日简报》分别于五月十四日和十五日发表了突尼斯《青年非洲》周刊驻联合国记者西蒙·马莱的一篇所谓关于周恩来总理接见他所作谈话的报道。
    中华人民共和国外交部新闻司发言人，就此发表谈话如下：西蒙·马莱作为过境旅行，曾于今年三月二十七日由柬埔寨抵京，二十九日离京经苏联去法国。在西蒙·马莱逗留北京的两天中，周恩来总理或中国任何其他领导人如陈伯达、陈毅、杨成武等同志都没有接见过他。美、英报刊的上述报道完全是别有用心的彻头彻尾的捏造。
