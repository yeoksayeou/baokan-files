Strike at the Vital Point and Hit Hard

The militia team of Jiangsu Province Hai'an County Jiaoqiao "Red Flag" and the Red Guards militia company commander Cao Lianmei

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." To overthrow reactionary things, you must hit the vital point. It's like striking a poisonous snake; you must smash its head to kill it. In criticizing the top capitalist-roader in the Party's poisonous weed *Self-Cultivation*, we must also hit the vital point.

After the mass criticism began, we, with deep hatred for the top capitalist-roader in the Party, bravely joined the battle. To hit the vital point, I studied Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind. Chairman Mao said: "To overthrow a government, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "The fundamental problem of revolution is the problem of state power." Chairman Mao's teachings illuminated my mind, making me understand that whether the top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates the "Four Freedoms" or promotes the "Three Selfs and One Package," or eagerly peddles his book *Self-Cultivation*, ultimately, he wants to restore capitalism and is scheming for power. Take *Self-Cultivation* for example. This number one conspirator, at crucial moments in several revolutionary struggles, always throws out this book. He avoids talking about the fundamental problem of revolution being the problem of state power, avoids talking about the dictatorship of the proletariat, with the purpose of making us forget class struggle, forget power, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and thus achieve his reactionary goal of restoring capitalism. He doesn't talk about power with his mouth, but he thinks about power in his heart and works to restore capitalism. His heart is so poisonous.

Having grasped this vital point, we bring his reactionary words and deeds to this issue for recognition, analysis, and criticism. In this way, our hatred for him deepens, and the firepower of our criticism becomes more intense, layer by layer peeling off his disguise, exposing his wolfish ambitions under the bright sunlight.

We say that we must fiercely criticize the top capitalist-roader in the Party. Fierce means hitting the vital point. Grasping the vital point, one shot, one hit. Only in this way can we criticize him deeply and thoroughly, and politically overthrow him completely.

    对准要害狠狠地打

    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”要打倒反动的东西，就得击中要害。好比打毒蛇，只有砸烂它的头，才能把它打死。我们批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》，也要击中要害。
    在群众性的大批判开始以后，我们怀着对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的刻骨仇恨，奋勇投入战斗。为了击中要害，我带着问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”毛主席还指出：“革命的根本问题是政权问题。”毛主席的教导，照亮了我的心，使我懂得，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“四大自由”也罢，提倡“三自一包”也罢，竭力推销他的那本《修养》也罢，归根结底，都是想复辟资本主义，都是在政权上打主意。就以《修养》来说，这个头号阴谋家，在几次革命斗争的关键时刻，他总要抛出这本《修养》来。他闭口不谈革命的根本问题是政权问题，闭口不谈无产阶级专政问题，目的就是想叫我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记政权，忘记无产阶级专政，从而实现他复辟资本主义的反动目的。他嘴上不谈政权，但他心里想的是政权，干的是复辟资本主义。他的心何其毒也。
    抓住了这个要害，我们就把他的反动言行，提到这个问题上来认识，来分析，来批判。这样，对他的仇恨就更深，批判的火力就更猛，一层一层地剥去他的画皮，使他的狼子野心暴露在光天化日之下。
    我们说，对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派要狠狠地批，狠，就是要打中要害。抓住了要害，打一枪，中一枪。这样，才能把他批深批臭，从政治上彻底打倒他。
