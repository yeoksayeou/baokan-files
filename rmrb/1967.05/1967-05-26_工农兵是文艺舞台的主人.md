Our great leader Chairman Mao's letter "After Seeing 'Admonishing the Ancestor' Written to the Yan'an Drama Troupe" pointed out the correct direction for us. Today, in the midst of the great criticism of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and the nationwide celebration of the 25th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the republication of Chairman Mao's historic letter gives us great encouragement and boundless strength.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Under your brilliant guidance and under the personal leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolution in Peking Opera has achieved brilliant victories! When we look back on this journey, a thousand words cannot express our boundless loyalty to you, and a thousand songs cannot express our ardent praise. Let us, on this joyous day, wish from the bottom of our hearts that our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, live forever, live forever!

For seventeen years, the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line has dominated the arts, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts has not been implemented, especially in the world of Peking Opera. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party is the biggest obstacle to the revolution in Peking Opera. He, along with the head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Peng Zhen, and the likes of Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, and Qi Yan Ming, turned the Peking Opera world into an independent kingdom where water could not seep in and needles could not penetrate. On stage, they performed countless plays about emperors, generals, and scholars, creating public opinion to support their usurpation of the Party and the restoration of capitalism.

The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe was the biggest stronghold of the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the world of Peking Opera. The anti-Party poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was produced here. Plays like "The Fourth Son Visits His Mother" and "The Linked Rings," which praise surrender and betrayal, and "The Last Concubine" (also known as "The Secret History of the Qing Palace"), which praises treachery, as well as other vulgar plays like "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix," were all "signature performances" of the old Beijing Peking Opera Troupe. These plays were all performed under the "personal endorsement" of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party.

Comrade Jiang Qing said: "Eating the grain grown by peasants, wearing clothes woven by workers, living in houses built by workers, and having the People's Liberation Army guarding our national defense frontiers, but not portraying them—where do artists stand in terms of class? Where is the 'conscience' you often talk about?" Indeed, who among the broad revolutionary cultural workers would want to serve a small clique of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and bourgeois elements on the liberated socialist stage? Who could tolerate the old masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies continuing to rule the stage? Yet, the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat and madly resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts, using every means to strangle the revolution in Peking Opera.

The wheel of history will not be turned back by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists. The new forces will ultimately triumph over the decaying elements. Comrade Jiang Qing came to our troupe to conduct experiments, bringing us Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. Under Comrade Jiang Qing's guidance and cultivation, the revolutionary Peking Opera model play "Sha Jia Bang" was born, and the stubborn stronghold of the old Beijing Peking Opera Troupe was broken. The era when old masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies ruled the Beijing Peking Opera stage has passed! The ancient Peking Opera, which was on the brink of death, has gained new life!

The victory of the Peking Opera revolution pronounced the bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the arts and the complete failure of bourgeois dictatorship in the world of Peking Opera! It opened a new era for proletarian arts! This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts! This is the great victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will always keep your great teachings in our hearts. Under your brilliant guidance, we will resolutely carry out the revolution in Peking Opera for life, so that the heroes of the Mao Zedong era of workers, peasants, and soldiers will stand firmly on the socialist Peking Opera stage, and so that Mao Zedong Thought will forever shine brightly on the Peking Opera stage!

    工农兵是文艺舞台的主人
    北京京剧一团《沙家浜》革命战斗兵团
    我们伟大领袖毛主席《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》，给我们指出了正确的航向。今天，在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，在全国人民热烈纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的欢庆声中，重新发表毛主席的这个具有历史意义的信件，给我们以极大的鼓舞和无穷的力量。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在您的光辉思想的指引下，在江青同志亲自领导下，京剧革命取得了辉煌的胜利！当我们回顾这段历程的时候，千言万语倾诉不尽我们对您的无限忠诚，千歌万曲表达不出我们对您的热情歌颂。让我们在这大喜的日子里，最最衷心地祝愿您——我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆，万寿无疆！
    十七年来，反革命修正主义文艺黑线统治着文艺界，毛主席的革命文艺路线在文艺界得不到贯彻，在京剧界更是如此。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是京剧革命的一只最大的拦路虎，他伙同旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团的头子彭真，以及周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭之流，把京剧界变成一个水泼不进、针插不入的独立王国，在舞台上大量上演帝王将相、才子佳人的坏戏，为他们篡党篡国、复辟资本主义制造舆论。
    北京京剧一团是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在京剧界的一个最大堡垒。反党大毒草《海瑞罢官》就是在这里加工出笼的。歌颂投降变节的《四郎探母》《连环套》，歌颂卖国主义的《珍妃》（即《清宫秘史》），其他如黄色下流的《游龙戏凤》等等坏戏，也都是旧北京京剧团的“拿手好戏”。这些戏都在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派“钦点”下，登场了。
    江青同志说：“吃着农民种的粮食，穿着工人织造的衣服，住着工人盖的房子，人民解放军为我们警卫着国防前线，但是却不去表现他们，试问，艺术家站在什么阶级立场，你们常说的艺术家的‘良心’何在？”是啊！广大的革命文艺工作者谁愿意在解放了的社会主义舞台上再为一小撮地、富、反、坏、右以及资产阶级分子服务呢？谁能容忍老爷太太少爷小姐们继续统治舞台呢？可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派叛卖无产阶级专政，丧心病狂地抵制毛主席的革命文艺路线，千方百计地扼杀京剧革命。
    历史的车轮决不会被一小撮反革命修正主义分子拉回去，新生的力量终究是要战胜腐朽的东西的。江青同志来我团搞试验田，给我们带来了毛主席的革命文艺路线，带来了光焰无际的毛泽东思想。在江青同志的指导和培植下，革命的京剧样板戏《沙家浜》诞生了，旧北京京剧团这个顽固的堡垒被攻破了，北京京剧舞台上长期以来由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治舞台的时代一去不复返了！濒于死亡的古老的京剧获得了新的生命！
    京剧革命的胜利，宣判了反革命修正主义文艺路线的破产，宣判了京剧界资产阶级专政的彻底失败！它开辟了无产阶级文艺的新纪元。这是毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！这是无产阶级专政的伟大胜利！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您对我们的伟大教导，我们永远记在心上，在您的光辉思想指引下，我们坚决闹一辈子京剧革命，让毛泽东时代的工农兵英雄人物牢牢地屹立在社会主义的京剧舞台上，让毛泽东思想永远永远在京剧舞台上光芒四射！
