The people of South Vietnam, in their winter-spring dry-season battles, have smashed the so-called "dry-season offensive" of U.S. imperialism, annihilating a large number of the enemy's forces. This is a great victory for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and it is a great victory for people's war.

The failure of the war of aggression against Vietnam has disrupted the global strategy of U.S. imperialism, making it lose face worldwide. In order to escape this passive situation, U.S. imperialism has been continuously sending more troops to South Vietnam, concentrating over a million American aggressor troops, mercenary troops, and puppet troops, and frenziedly expanding the war. It attempts, relying on its superiority in manpower and weapons, to launch one large-scale "sweeping operation" after another, aiming for a strategic quick victory. However, this plan of U.S. imperialism has been completely shattered by the people's war of the South Vietnamese people.

During the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao taught us, "The Japanese intend to adopt a strategic quick victory, and we should consciously adopt a strategic protracted war." Chairman Mao also said, "My strategic protracted war becomes a quick victory on the battlefield. The enemy's strategic quick victory, after suffering defeats in many battles and engagements, has to be changed into a protracted war."

The great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation are precisely because they have adopted a strategic protracted war and quick victories in battles and engagements. The South Vietnamese people have utilized their advantages, employing the strategies and tactics of people's war, to engage the American aggressor troops and puppet troops, fighting quickly, accurately, and fiercely, continuously annihilating the enemy's forces. This has shattered the American aggressors' dream of a quick victory, tying them down and gradually consuming them.

U.S. imperialism appears to be a formidable force, but it is most afraid of a protracted war. Once engaged in a protracted war, its fatal weaknesses such as insufficient manpower, low morale, distant rear, and financial difficulties become increasingly exposed. Chairman Mao said, "Battles of annihilation are the means to achieve the goal of strategic attrition," and "Battles of attrition are auxiliary but are also necessary for protracted warfare." While continuously annihilating and wearing down the enemy, the South Vietnamese people have minimized their own losses, strengthened and accumulated their own forces, and persisted in strategic protracted war and quick victories in battles.

People's war is the most effective weapon against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The people's war of the South Vietnamese people has already demonstrated its immense power to defeat the enemy. Although U.S. imperialism is unwilling to accept its defeat and continues to struggle desperately, the heroic South Vietnamese people, who are growing stronger in their struggle, will certainly be able to deliver even heavier blows to the American aggressors and achieve a complete victory in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, as long as they adhere to the correct strategic line and further unleash the mighty power of people's war.

### 用人民战争致美帝于死命

    用人民战争致美帝于死命
    越南南方军民在去冬今春的旱季战斗中，粉碎了美帝国主义的所谓“旱季攻势”，歼灭了敌人的大量有生力量。这是越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利，这是人民战争的伟大胜利。
    侵越战争的失败，打乱了美帝国主义的全球战略，使它在全世界威风扫地。美帝国主义为了摆脱这种被动局面，不断向南越增兵，集中了上百万的美国侵略军、帮凶军和伪军，疯狂扩大战争。它妄图凭借兵力和武器的优势，发动一次又一次大规模的“扫荡”，实行战略的速决战。但是，美帝国主义这个如意算盘，完全被越南南方军民的人民战争粉碎了。
    毛主席在中国抗日战争时期曾经教导我们说，“日本企图采取战略的速决战，我们应自觉地采取战略的持久战。”毛主席又说，“我之战略的持久战，到战场作战就变成速决战了。敌之战略的速决战，经过许多战役和战斗的败仗，就不得不改为持久战。”
    越南南方军民在抗美救国斗争中取得伟大的胜利，正是因为实行了战略的持久战、战役和战斗的速决战。越南南方军民发挥自己的优势，运用人民战争的战略战术，揪住美国侵略军和傀儡军，打得快，打得准，打得狠，不断消灭敌人的有生力量。这就粉碎了美国侵略者速战速决的迷梦，把它拖住，一口一口地把它吃掉。
    美帝国主义看来是个庞然大物，但是它最怕打持久战。一打持久战，它的兵力不足、士气低落、后方遥远、财政困难等等致命弱点就越加暴露出来。毛主席说，“战役的歼灭战是达到战略的消耗战之目的的手段”，“战役的消耗战，是辅助的，但也是持久作战所需要的”。越南南方军民在不断歼灭和消耗敌人的同时，尽可能减少自己的消耗，壮大和积蓄自己的力量，坚持了战略的持久战和战役的速决战。
    人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。越南南方军民的人民战争，已经发挥了克敌制胜的无比巨大的威力。虽然美帝国主义不甘心于自己的失败，还在继续进行疯狂的挣扎。但是，越战越强的英雄的越南南方军民，只要坚持正确的战略方针，进一步发挥人民战争的强大威力，就一定能够给美国侵略者以更沉重的打击，取得抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。
