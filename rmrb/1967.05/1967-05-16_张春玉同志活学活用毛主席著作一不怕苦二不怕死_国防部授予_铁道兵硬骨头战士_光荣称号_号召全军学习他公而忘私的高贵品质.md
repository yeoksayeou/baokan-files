The Ministry of National Defense has issued an order conferring the honorary title of "Iron-Railway Soldier" on Zhang Chunyu, deputy squad leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's Railway Corps.

The order states that since joining the army, Comrade Zhang Chunyu has consistently carried out Chairman Mao's teachings with deep class feelings. He has taken Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and other heroes as his examples, learning and doing good deeds, and is willing to be a railway soldier forever, building roads for the people forever. He strictly demands of himself in everything, works hard, and is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works at the regiment and division levels. He has been continuously rated as an outstanding soldier and has been awarded many times. On the night of June 30, 1965, during the construction of a tunnel in the Da Xing'anling forest area, when an unexpected cave-in occurred, he fearlessly rushed to rescue the injured comrades. Unfortunately, he was pinned by the edge of a falling boulder weighing tens of thousands of jin for more than two hours, resulting in a severe compound fracture of the left femur and a break of three ribs on the right side. In the face of such heavy injuries and life-threatening conditions, Zhang Chunyu, with unyielding perseverance and revolutionary optimism, fought tenaciously against his injuries. He studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, always cared for the safety of his injured comrades, and never forgot the work of his unit. He fully demonstrated his high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause and the noble qualities of a proletarian soldier who fears neither hardship nor death, seeks no fame or gain. For this, he is conferred the honorary title of "Iron-Railway Soldier."

The Ministry of National Defense hopes that Comrade Zhang Chunyu will maintain and carry forward this honor. It calls on all soldiers and officers of the army to learn from Zhang Chunyu's selfless and public-spirited noble qualities. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics, and strive to learn, implement, and propagate Mao Zedong Thought. They should defend Mao Zedong Thought and better accomplish all tasks assigned by the Party and the state.
