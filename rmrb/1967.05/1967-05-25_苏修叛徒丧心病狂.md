The Soviet revisionist leadership's open betrayal of the world revolution and their role as the number one accomplice of American imperialism is well known to all.

This year in March, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin's anti-China speech exposed his ugly soul once again. Kosygin said that America's war in Vietnam is "a hopeless venture" and complained that America "has not utilized" the "possibility of starting negotiations on the Vietnam issue." At the same time, to cover up his traitorous face, Kosygin made shameless slanders and attacks on our country, saying that our government's exposure and opposition to the "bombing to force surrender" plot, which was planned by the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, "is in line with the stance of the American imperialist group," and is "serving the imperialists and all enemies of communism."

Kosygin's slanders and attacks on our country, using such despicable tricks to distort right and wrong, absolutely cannot cover up the Soviet revisionist traitor clique's heinous crimes of betraying the Vietnamese people.

Since the end of last year, the American imperialists, who have been beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people on the battlefield in Vietnam, have intensified their counter-revolutionary two-pronged policy to cling to South Vietnam. On one hand, they are bombing North Vietnam indiscriminately, trying to "force surrender through bombing"; on the other hand, they are using the same old tricks, pushing hard for a "peace talk" scam, conducting "bombing to force surrender." When the surrender plot fails, they then push for forced surrender.

To support the American bandits' counter-revolutionary plots, all kinds of ghosts and demons on the international stage have taken the stage, drumming up a frenzied performance of the plot to stage "peace talks." The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has played a very shameful role in this. Since this year, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique has mobilized all its propaganda machines to cheer for this plot of the American imperialists, shouting in unison, saying that the Vietnam War "is the main source of threat to universal peace," hysterically screaming "let the guns fall silent in Vietnam," and blatantly demanding that the Vietnamese people accept the conditions of the American invaders, begging for "peace."

At the same time, Soviet leaders like Podgorny and Kosygin have personally taken action, running around, fanning the flames and stirring up trouble for the American imperialists' "peace talk" plot, working hard behind the scenes. In late January, Podgorny visited Italy and actually colluded with the extremely reactionary Vatican Pope, paving the way for the American imperialists' "peace talk" plot. Soon after, Kosygin also crossed the ocean, under the direction of the American imperialist chief Johnson, and together with the British Labour Party government leader Wilson, shouted for an "early end to the Vietnam War."

Ironclad facts prove that the Soviet revisionist leadership is the number one accomplice of American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam; they are a small group of great traitors and great scoundrels.

Surrounding the Vietnam issue, there has been a sharp struggle between two lines on the international stage. One is the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism, which is to resolutely support the Vietnamese people in carrying out their national revolutionary war to the end, completing the sacred cause of national liberation and national reunification; the other is the counter-revolutionary line of revisionism, which is to betray the Vietnamese people, forcing the Vietnamese people to kneel and seek peace with American imperialism, making the Vietnamese people's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause die halfway. This is a struggle between two irreconcilable lines. The great people of China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet revisionists, however, are thoroughly pushing the counter-revolutionary line of revisionism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their doom." Our government has always firmly believed that the only way to solve the Vietnam issue is for the American aggressors to completely and cleanly get out of Vietnam. This is a principle issue and cannot be ambiguous. We seven hundred million Chinese people, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always firmly fulfilled our sacred internationalist duty of the proletariat, unconditionally and unreservedly supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, until the heroic Vietnamese people completely drive the American imperialists out of Vietnamese territory and unify their great motherland.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, however, uses every means to help American imperialism cheat, deceive, pressure, and attack the Vietnamese people's great national revolutionary war. In a word, they want the Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons, become slaves, and bury the good situation of the Vietnamese national revolutionary war. This group of traitors from the Soviet revisionists is truly heartless and mad to the extreme!

The American imperialists and their number one accomplice, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, in their rampant activities on the Vietnam issue, do not show their strength, but rather expose their weak essence, showing that they are already at the end of the road. The dirty deals between the Soviet revisionists and the Americans on the Vietnam issue are bound to fail.

    苏修叛徒丧心病狂
    北京师范大学“井岡山”公社
    苏修领导集团公开背叛世界革命，充当美帝国主义头号帮凶的叛徒行径，早已人所共知。
    今年三月，苏修头目柯西金的一次反华讲话，是他的丑恶灵魂的又一次大暴露。柯西金在讲话中说什么美国在越南的战争是
  “没有前途的事情”，抱怨美国
  “没有利用”就“越南问题开始谈判的可能性”。同时，柯西金为了掩饰自己的叛徒嘴脸，对我国进行了无耻的诬蔑和攻击，胡说什么我国政府揭露和反对美帝勾结苏修叛徒集团一手策划的
  “停炸诱降”的阴谋，“是同美国帝国主义集团的立场相吻合的”，是“为帝国主义者和共产主义的一切敌人效劳。”
    柯西金诬蔑和攻击我国的这种颠倒黑白、混淆是非的卑劣伎俩，绝对掩盖不了苏修叛徒集团出卖越南人民的滔天罪行。
    从去年年底以来，在越南战场上被英雄的越南人民打得落花流水的美帝国主义，为了死赖在越南南方，变本加厉地玩弄反革命两手政策。它一方面对越南北方狂轰滥炸，企图“以炸迫降”；另一方面，又老调重弹，大搞“和谈”骗局，进行“停炸诱降”。诱降阴谋破了产，则又大搞压降的一手。
    为了配合美国强盗的反革命阴谋，国际舞台上形形色色的牛鬼蛇神一齐登台表演，密锣紧鼓地演出策划“和谈”阴谋的丑剧。苏修叛徒集团在其中扮演了极为可耻的角色。今年以来，苏修叛徒集团就开动所有宣传机器，为美帝这一阴谋摇旗呐喊，遥相呼应，说什么越南战争“是威胁普遍和平的主要策源地”，歇斯底里地狂叫“让炮声在越南停止下来”，并且明目张胆地要越南人民接受美国侵略者的条件，向它乞求“和平”。
    与此同时，苏修头目波德戈尔内与柯西金之流，亲自出马，上窜下跳，为美帝的“和谈”阴谋煽阴风、点鬼火，奔走效劳。一月下旬，波德戈尔内访问意大利，居然与反动透顶的梵蒂冈教皇相勾结，为美帝“和谈”阴谋开道。随后不久，柯西金也飘洋过海，在美帝国主义头子约翰逊的幕后指挥下，和英国工党政府头子威尔逊共同叫嚷要“及早结束越南战争”。
    铁的事实证明，苏修领导集团是美帝国主义侵略越南的头号帮凶，他们是一小撮大叛徒和大工贼。
    围绕着越南问题，在国际范围内，一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。一条是马克思列宁主义的革命路线，这就是坚决支持越南人民把民族革命战争进行到底，完成民族解放和国家统一的神圣事业；一条是修正主义的反革命路线，这就是出卖越南人民，诱迫越南人民向美帝国主义屈膝求和，使越南人民的反帝革命事业半途夭折。这是水火不相容的两条路线的斗争。用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民，坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线。而苏修推行的则是彻头彻尾的修正主义反革命路线。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”我国政府一向坚定不移地认为，解决越南问题，唯一的出路是美国侵略者全部、干净地从越南滚出去。这是个原则问题，是绝对不能含糊的。我们七亿中国人民，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，始终坚决履行自己神圣的无产阶级国际主义义务，无条件地、毫无保留地支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，直到英雄的越南人民把美帝国主义彻底驱逐出越南国土，统一自己伟大的祖国。
    苏修领导集团却千方百计地用帮助美帝国主义骗、诈、压、打的办法，来扑灭越南人民的这场伟大的民族革命战争。一句话，就是要越南人民放下武器，甘当奴隶，葬送越南民族革命战争的大好形势。苏修这一伙叛徒真是狼心狗肺，丧心病狂到了极点！
    美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏修叛徒集团在越南问题上的猖狂活动，并不说明他们的强大，相反，正是他们的虚弱本质的大暴露，说明他们已经是穷途末路了。苏修同美帝在越南问题上进行的肮脏交易肯定要破产的。
