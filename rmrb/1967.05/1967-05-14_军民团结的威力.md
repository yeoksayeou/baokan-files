We young people have never been interested in Peking opera in the past. We detested those pretentious emperors and generals, and we also disliked those sickly romantic poets and beauties. Revolutionary modern Peking opera is completely different. We watched the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Detachment of Women" and felt very exhilarated. Such plays are not only understandable but also educational, and we can draw strength from the heroic characters on stage.

The revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Detachment of Women" passionately praises our soldiers who, for the people's interests, dare to fight and dare to win, and are not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice. It praises the broad masses of people's love for their army, praises the glorious tradition of supporting the army and loving the people.

The eighteen wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army were wounded in battle for the people's interests. During their convalescence in the village, they never forgot the people and never left the people's side. They helped the people harvest rice despite their injuries and propagated among the people. In the reeds, under the harsh conditions of storms and lack of food and medicine, they cared not for themselves but for the safety of the people of Sand Family Bay. They preferred to eat reed roots and drink lake water, enduring the pain of their injuries, rather than burdening the people. They thought of class hatred and national enmity; they thought of when they would return to the battlefield, fight the traitors, kill the devils, and avenge the thousands and millions of their fellow countrymen. This is the noble quality of the wounded soldiers in "The Red Detachment of Women" and the heroic spirit shared by the broad masses of soldiers in the people's army.

The people's army loves the people, and the people love the soldiers. The people of Sand Family Bay regarded the eighteen wounded soldiers as their own flesh and blood, treating them like brothers. To help them recover quickly, Grandma Sand carefully tended to them, mended and washed their clothes, and diligently took care of their lives. To rescue the soldiers hiding in the reeds, Ah Qing fought bravely and intelligently against the cunning and vicious enemy. ... In the years of war, we had so many such moving stories!

Our army and people can be so close-knit, shoulder to shoulder, sharing life and death, and facing hardships together because in the hearts of our broad masses of soldiers and people, there is a red sun—the reddest red sun—our great leader Chairman Mao; because they have a common ideology—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Today, watching the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Red Detachment of Women," I feel particularly close. At this critical moment of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army has come among the broad masses. The PLA has brought us Mao Zedong Thought and the glorious tradition of the old Red Army. The PLA has helped us rectify our work, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, and achieve revolutionary great unity; helped us "grasp revolution and promote production," repel the fierce counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, overthrow counter-revolutionary economism, and launch a new high tide of industrial and agricultural production; helped us seize back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road within the party, and achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Where there are difficulties, there is the PLA; where there is the PLA, there is victory. We must carry forward the glorious tradition of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, love the PLA, support the PLA, rely on the PLA, and cherish military-civilian unity as we cherish our own eyes.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will greatly flourish socialist literature and art in our country. We firmly believe that flowers like "The Red Detachment of Women," which shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, will continue to bloom on the socialist stage!

    军民团结的威力
    清华大学井冈山红卫兵　李铮
    我们这些年青人，过去对京剧根本不感兴趣，我们厌恶那些装腔作势的帝王将相，也讨厌那些无病呻吟的才子佳人。革命的现代京剧，完全是两个样。我们看了革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，感到非常痛快。这样的戏，不但听得懂，看得懂，而且从舞台上的英雄人物身上，能吸取力量，能受到教育。
    革命现代京剧《沙家浜》满腔热情地歌颂了我们的子弟兵为了人民的利益，不怕流血牺牲，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的英雄气概；歌颂了广大人民热爱自己军队的阶级感情，歌颂了拥军爱民这个光荣传统。
    新四军十八个伤病员，为了人民的利益在战斗中光荣负伤。在村里养伤期间，他们一刻也没有忘记人民群众，一刻也没有离开人民群众。他们带伤为群众收稻子，向群众进行宣传。在芦苇荡里，在狂风暴雨侵袭的恶劣环境中，在既缺食粮又缺医药的困难条件下，他们关心的不是自己，而是沙家浜群众的安全。他们宁可饥餐芦根，渴饮湖水，忍受伤病折磨，也不愿增加群众的负担。他们想到的是阶级仇，民族恨；想到的是什么时候重上战场，打汉奸，杀鬼子，为千千万万的同胞报仇雪恨。这就是《沙家浜》伤病员的高尚品质，也是人民军队广大指战员共有的英雄气概。
    人民军队爱人民，人民热爱子弟兵。沙家浜人民把十八个伤病员视为亲骨肉，待如亲兄弟。为了使他们早日养好伤，沙奶奶精心调理，缝补浆洗，辛勤照顾战士们的生活。为了营救掩蔽在芦荡里的战士们脱险，阿庆嫂面对阴险狠毒的敌人，展开了英勇机智的斗争。……在战争的年代里，我们有多少这样可歌可泣的事迹呵！
    我们的军队和人民，所以能够这样心连心，肩并肩，同生死，共患难，是因为在我们广大战士、广大人民的心中，都有一个最红最红的红太阳——我们伟大的领袖毛主席；是因为他们头脑里有一个共同的思想——战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    今天，看了革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，感到特别亲切。在无产阶级文化大革命的关键时刻，人民解放军来到广大群众中间。解放军给我们带来毛泽东思想，带来了老红军的光荣传统。解放军帮助我们整风，克服自己头脑里的各种非无产阶级思想，实现革命的大联合；帮助我们“抓革命，促生产”，击退资产阶级反动路线的猖狂反扑，打倒反革命经济主义，掀起了工农业生产的新高潮；帮助我们从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手里夺回党、政、财、文大权，实现革命的“三结合”。哪里有困难，哪里就有解放军在；哪里有解放军在，哪里就有胜利。我们一定要发扬老根据地人民的光荣传统，热爱解放军，拥护解放军，依靠解放军，象爱护眼珠一样地爱护军民团结。
    无产阶级文化大革命，必将大大地繁荣我国社会主义文艺。我们坚信，象《沙家浜》这样的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的鲜花，一定会在社会主义的舞台上不断盛开！
