As a young worker in the field of literary theory, through several years of practical work in the literary world and a year of struggle during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have deeply felt that: Chairman Mao's great work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is our guiding light in revolutionary literary work. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the ideological realm, we cannot for a moment part with Chairman Mao's brilliant work.

Just as we stepped into the literary work post, two roads were sharply presented before us. Chairman Mao pointed out a revolutionary path for us in his "Talks," a path to become successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Chairman Mao wants us to stand on the side of the proletariat and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. He repeatedly instructs us: "We must shift our stand, we must shift it to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat, in the course of our participation in the practical struggle of the masses, in the course of our study of Marxism and of society." We are the young people raised by Chairman Mao, how willing we are to follow Chairman Mao's words and advance along this revolutionary broad road! We sincerely hope to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, to be spokesmen for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to be brave soldiers charging against revisionism.

However, over the past more than ten years since liberation, the old Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, and their backers, China's Khrushchev, have done everything possible to lead us astray and make us their successors. To achieve this goal, they use various means to suppress and poison us. They say that literature should serve the "whole people," that the task of literary criticism is not to "destroy the old and establish the new" but to "summarize artistic experience," and so on. In short, they want to obliterate class struggle in the literary world, disarm us ideologically, and let all erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, and all monsters and demons run wild, to undermine the foundations of the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialism. As soon as we criticize a bit of bourgeois and revisionist literary thought, they fly into a rage, impose bourgeois dictatorship on us. They label us with all sorts of hats: "simplistic and rough," "dogmatism," "not knowing strategy," and so on! This is not enough; they also want us to follow them to apologize to those bourgeois reactionary "authorities"! If you are not willing? That is "arrogance," that is "not listening to the Party's words"!

Besides this open suppression, they also use a soft knife to cut our heads off, that is, to isolate us from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to isolate us from the fiery struggle of life, and to corrupt our souls with bourgeois ideas of fame and wealth. The top capitalist-roader in the Party and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary world want us to study in seclusion, to learn "tradition," to "enrich knowledge," and to strive to be "first-class" theorists. What tradition? What knowledge? It is the feudal literature of several thousand years, the bourgeois literature of several hundred years, and the revisionist literature of the 1930s. They stipulate: political study and participation in labor should not exceed 20% of the working day. They say this is "cultivation," this is "cherishing talent"! What cultivation? What cherishing? It is poisoning! It is bloodless poisoning! According to their methods, we do not see the faces of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we do not hear the voices of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, we lack feelings for the workers, peasants, and soldiers in our hearts, and we have even fewer friends who are workers, peasants, and soldiers in our lives. How can we be spokesmen for the workers, peasants, and soldiers? How can we serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers?

It is our most beloved leader Chairman Mao who guides us and prevents us from losing our way. It is he who issued the great call to never forget class struggle, sounding the alarm for us; it is he who, with his instructions on the literary world, uncovered the lid of class struggle in the literary world and brightened our eyes; it is he who personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enabling us to see our enemies more clearly. We want to express a thousand times, ten thousand times to Chairman Mao: We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, go deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, firmly grasp the "pen" for the proletariat, and become steadfast successors to the revolutionary literary cause of the proletariat!

    誓做无产阶级革命文艺事业的接班人
    戴厚英
    作为一个青年文艺理论工作者，通过在文艺界短短的几年工作实践和无产阶级文化大革命中一年来的斗争实践，深深地体会到：毛主席的伟大著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是我们革命文艺工作的指路明灯。在意识形态领域内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，我们一时一刻也不能离开毛主席的这部光芒四射的宝书。
    刚刚踏上文艺工作岗位，两条道路就尖锐地摆在我们面前。毛主席在《讲话》中给我们指出了一条革命化的道路，一条做无产阶级革命事业接班人的道路。毛主席教导我们：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”毛主席要我们站在无产阶级的立场上，为工农兵群众服务。他一再嘱咐我们：“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”我们是毛主席一手抚养大的青年，我们是多么愿意听毛主席的话，沿着这条革命的康庄大道前进啊！我们非常希望能按照毛主席的指示，做一个工农兵群众的代言人，做一名向修正主义冲锋陷阵的勇猛小兵。
    但是，解放十几年来，旧中宣部、旧文化部以及他们的后台老板、中国的赫鲁晓夫，却千方百计要把我们引上邪路，变成他们的接班人。为了达到这一目的，他们采取各种各样的手段来压制我们，毒害我们。他们说，文艺要为“全民”服务，文艺批评的任务主要不是灭资兴无，而是“总结艺术经验”，等等。一句话，他们妄图抹煞文艺界的阶级斗争，解除我们的思想武装，让一切错误的思想、一切毒草、一切牛鬼蛇神自由泛滥，拆无产阶级专政和社会主义的墙脚。我们刚刚对资产阶级、修正主义文艺思想进行了一点批判，他们就暴跳如雷，对我们实行资产阶级专政。什么“简单粗暴”，什么“教条主义”，什么“不懂策略”，帽子一大堆！这样还不够，他们还要我们跟着他们一起到那些资产阶级反动“权威”的家里“赔礼道歉”！你不乐意吗？那就是“骄傲自大”，就是“不听党的话”！
    在这种公开压制以外，他们还运用一手软刀子割头的办法，那就是把我们与工农兵群众隔绝，与火热的斗争生活隔绝，用资产阶级的名利思想来腐蚀我们的灵魂。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，要我们闭门读书，学习“传统”，“丰富知识”，争取做“第一流”的理论家。什么传统？什么知识？就是几千年的封建文艺，几百年的资产阶级文艺和三十年代的修正主义文艺。他们规定：政治学习和参加劳动的时间不得超过工作日的百分之二十。他们说这是对我们的“培养”，这是“爱惜人材”！这是什么“培养”？什么“爱惜”？是毒害啊！是杀人不见血的毒害！依照他们的办法，我们眼不见工农兵的面貌，耳不闻工农兵的声音，心里缺乏工农兵的感情，生活里更少工农兵的朋友。我们还怎么能做工农兵的代言人？怎么能为工农兵服务呢？
    是我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席指引着我们，使我们没有迷失方向。是他老人家发出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召，给我们敲响了警钟；是他老人家对文艺界的几次批示，揭开了文艺领域阶级斗争的盖子，擦亮了我们的眼睛；是他老人家亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，使我们进一步认清了敌人。我们要一千次、一万次向毛主席表示：我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，深入到工农兵群众中去，为无产阶级紧紧握住“笔杆子”，做无产阶级革命文艺事业的坚强接班人！
