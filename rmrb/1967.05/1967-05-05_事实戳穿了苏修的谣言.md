Recently, some newspapers of the Soviet revisionists have published numerous articles viciously attacking our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, claiming that the "cultural revolution has caused the country to be on the verge of collapse," that "collective economy is disintegrating," that "agriculture has suffered huge losses," and that "production has plummeted sharply," and so on. This is all sheer nonsense and sheer fabrication. I am a Chinese peasant, and hearing these lies makes me extremely indignant.

A small clique of Soviet revisionist lords, open your eyes and see the great situation of our revolution and production! Open your ears and listen to the voices of Chinese peasants!

Our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great revolution that touches the souls of the people, a revolution to uproot the roots of revisionism in our country.

Before liberation, the three great mountains weighed heavily on the laboring people. We suffered greatly, had nothing to eat, nothing to wear, and lived a life worse than cattle. Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the oppressors and embark on the socialist path. However, a small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists still did not give up. They wanted to drag us back to the old semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we have exposed the chief power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and the backstage boss of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists. This revolution, if well conducted, will prevent our country from changing color, and we peasants will not suffer a second time.

Because this revolution is well conducted, we are particularly happy, our work enthusiasm is greater, and production is better than ever. Take our Hongjin Production Brigade's First Production Team as an example. All the team members study Chairman Mao's works, participate in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and their eyes have become brighter, distinguishing good from bad; their ears have become more sensitive, distinguishing good words from bad; their minds have become clearer, distinguishing socialism from capitalism; their hearts have become redder, discarding selfishness and replacing it with dedication; their spirits have become more vigorous, and their labor enthusiasm has soared. People change their minds, and the land changes its appearance, making production even more outstanding.

In 1966, our production achieved an all-around bumper harvest. Compared to 1965, the average yield of cotton increased by 7%, rice increased by more than 20%, and wheat increased by more than 10%. These yields also surpassed the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. This year, we resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production," studied the letter from the Party Central Committee to us poor and lower-middle peasants and cadres at all levels, and our spirits are even higher. During the Spring Festival, we did not rest and went to the fields to fertilize despite the heavy rain and snow. Whether it was fertilizing, selecting seeds, or tilling the land, our preparatory work was done earlier and better than ever before. Our people's commune is becoming more consolidated, our production is increasing year by year, and our lives are improving like sesame flowers blooming—higher and higher. In 1966, each person's income increased by 13% compared to 1965, also surpassing the level of the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. Our people's commune is so consolidated, and our agricultural production is so good. Is this called "suffering losses"? "Production decline"? "Disintegration of the collective economy"? You, this bunch of revisionist lords, are completely talking nonsense with your eyes closed. Your fabrication of rumors is completely malicious!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A person, a party, an army, or a school, if not opposed by the enemy, that would not be good, that would mean they have merged with the enemy. If opposed by the enemy, that would be good, that would mean we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slanders us as utterly worthless, that would be even better, that would mean not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but also that our work has achieved great success."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is welcomed and praised by revolutionary people all over the world, but imperialists, revisionists, and all reactionaries hate it intensely. The Soviet revisionist leadership viciously attacks us, which means our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is correct, good, and has achieved great success. At the same time, it means that the Soviet revisionist leadership has done many evil deeds that cannot be seen, is terrified to death, and is afraid that the Soviet people will learn from China's example, rise up to rebel against you, remove you from office, and seize your power. You will no longer be able to sit on the heads of the Soviet people as officials and lords, and you will be finished. Precisely because you are afraid of this, you vigorously attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, trying to use rumors to deceive the Soviet people.

A poisonous snake will never turn into an eel. You shout loudly about "socialism" and "communism," which is completely a deception of the Soviet people. In the countryside, you implement "land distribution to teams," promote the "team contract system," and expand "private plots." You also use various methods to expand the privileges of collective farm leaders, increase their income, and it is said that some farm chairmen's salaries are tens of times higher than ordinary farm members. In state farms, you implement profit-first, and the manager has the power to arbitrarily hire and fire workers. You let this batch of new rich peasants oppress the peasants. What do you call this "socialism"? This is pure capitalism, making the vast majority of Soviet peasants suffer exploitation and oppression again, become beasts of burden, and suffer a second time. The tricks you play are the same as those played by the biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our Party. What we want to overthrow in our country is exactly this kind of thing.

You think you can use the method of cursing others to cover up your own capitalist evil deeds, but it is useless. Paper cannot cover fire, and living by fabricating rumors will not last long. We firmly believe that your conspiracy will eventually be exposed by the Soviet people. You, this small clique of revisionists, will eventually be overthrown by the Soviet people. Your good days are numbered. Ultimately, victory will belong to the great Soviet people!

### 事实戳穿了苏修的谣言

    事实戳穿了苏修的谣言
    学习毛主席著作积极分子
    江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队社员  顾阿桃
    近来，苏修的一些报纸登了许多文章，恶毒地攻击我们无产阶级文化大革命，什么“文化革命使国家衰竭不堪”，“集体经济正在瓦解”呀，什么“农业遭到了巨大的损失”，“生产急剧下降”等等。这完全是胡说八道，完全是造谣。我是一个中国农民，听了这些谣言，实在气愤。
    苏联一小撮修正主义老爷们，你们睁开眼睛，看看我们革命和生产的大好形势！你们竖起耳朵，听听我们中国农民的声音！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命，是挖掉我们国家修正主义根子的大革命。
    解放前，三座大山压在劳动人民头上，我们受苦受难，吃不饱，穿不暖，过着牛马不如的生活。毛主席领导我们翻身得解放，走上了社会主义道路。但是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，还是不死心，要想把我们拉回到半殖民地半封建社会的老路上去。在毛主席英明领导下，我们把党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了，把一小撮反革命修正主义分子的后台老板揪出来了。这场革命搞好了，我们国家就不会变颜色，我们农民就不会再吃第二趟苦头。
    正因为这场革命搞得好，所以我们心里特别高兴，劳动的劲头格外足，生产搞得好上加好。就拿我们洪泾大队第一生产队来讲，全体社员学习毛主席著作，参加无产阶级文化大革命，大家眼睛变亮了，好人坏人看得清了；耳朵变灵了，好话坏话听得出了；头脑更清醒了，社会主义和资本主义辨得明了；心更红了，丢掉私心换红心；干劲更足了，劳动积极性更高涨了。人换思想地变样，生产搞得更出色了。
    一九六六年我们的生产获得了全面大丰收，平均单产与一九六五年相比，棉花增加了百分之七，水稻增加了两成以上，三麦增加了一成以上。这些产量，也超过了大跃进的一九五八年。今年，我们坚决执行了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，学习了党中央给我们贫下中农和各级干部的一封信，劲头更足了，春耕生产搞得更好。春节里我们也没有休息，冒着大雨、大雪下田追肥。不管是施肥、选种、整地，备耕工作比以往任何一年都搞得又早又好。我们的人民公社越来越巩固，我们的生产一年比一年增加，我们的生活也象芝麻开花——节节高。一九六六年每人的收入比一九六五年提高了百分之十三，也超过了大跃进的一九五八年水平。我们人民公社这样巩固，农业生产这样好，难道叫“遭到损失”吗？“生产下降”吗？“集体经济正在瓦解”吗？你们这伙修正主义老爷们完全是闭着眼睛说瞎话，你们乱造谣言完全是别有用心的！
    毛主席教导我们：“一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，全世界的革命人民都欢迎，都称赞，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派却十分痛恨。苏修领导集团恶毒地攻击我们，这就是说我们的无产阶级文化大革命搞得对，搞得好，搞得很有成绩。同时，也就是说明，苏修领导集团干尽了见不得人的坏事，害怕得要死，怕苏联人民学习中国的样子，起来造你们的反，罢你们的官，夺你们的权，你们就不能再骑在苏联人民头上做官当老爷了，就完蛋了。正因为你们害怕这点，所以就起劲地攻击我们的无产阶级文化大革命，想靠造谣言来欺骗苏联人民。
    毒蛇总不会变成黄鳝。你们大叫大喊搞“社会主义”、“共产主义”，这完全是欺骗苏联人民。你们在农村里搞“分田到组”，推行“小组包干制”，扩大“自留田”。你们还用各种办法扩大集体农庄领导人的特权，增加他们的收入，听说有的农庄主席的工资比普通庄员高二、三十倍。在国营农场，你们搞利润挂帅，场长有权任意雇用和开除工人。你们让这批新富农欺压农民，这叫什么“社会主义”？这是地地道道的资本主义，使苏联广大农民再受剥削，受压迫，做牛马，吃第二趟苦头。你们搞的这些花样，同我国党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派搞的花样是一路货。我国要打倒的也就是这些货色。
    你们想用骂别人、挡自己的办法，来遮瞒自家搞资本主义的罪恶勾当，其实是没有用的。纸总是包不住火的，靠造谣过日子总是不会长的。我们坚决相信，你们的阴谋，迟早要被苏联人民戳穿。你们这一小撮修正主义分子，迟早要被苏联人民打倒。你们的“好日子”不长了。最后胜利，一定属于伟大的苏联人民！（龚乃光记录）
