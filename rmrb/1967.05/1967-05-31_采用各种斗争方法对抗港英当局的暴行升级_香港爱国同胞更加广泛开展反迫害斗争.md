Hong Kong compatriots' struggle against the persecution by the British authorities is developing more broadly. On May 29, 4,500 workers from the Oil Street Ferry Company, Wai Lun Textile Mill, Nam Fung Textile Mill, and Central Textile Mill took strike actions, angrily protesting against the British authorities' fascist bloody suppression of our compatriots and determined to resist violence to the end.

To intensify the persecution of workers at the Oil Street Ferry Company, the British authorities on May 26 openly sent plainclothes agents aboard the ships to monitor the workers, attempting to sabotage their anti-persecution struggle. This infuriated the workers. On the morning of May 29, workers posted notices at the piers of the eight ferry and motorboat routes operated by the company between Hong Kong and Kowloon, announcing a three-hour suspension of services from 6 AM to 9 AM. They resolutely responded to the calls of the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of various circles and the Anti-Persecution Struggle Committee of workers in various industries, using various struggle methods to counter the escalating brutality of the British authorities. They proudly declared, "The sky is the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, the earth is the earth of Mao Zedong Thought, and the sea is the sea of Mao Zedong Thought!" The workers expressed their determination to fight to the end.

The suspended ferries were all moored in the Oil Street Typhoon Shelter and Kowloon Bay. Workers posted large banners on the ships reading, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Protest against the British fascist atrocities!" "Immediately release the unjustly detained patriots!" These large banners were posted from the bow to the stern of the ships.

At 9 AM sharp, the ship horns blew in unison, signaling the end of the three-hour strike. As the ferries slowly left the pier, Kowloon bus drivers and "Star Ferry" workers continuously honked their horns, and passengers on the ferries applauded enthusiastically, paying tribute to the workers of the Oil Street Ferry Company.

On May 29, 2,700 workers from the three textile mills of Wai Lun, Nam Fung, and Central took strike actions, each shift stopping work for two to four hours. Workers posted anti-violence slogans inside and outside the factories and held meetings to protest against the British persecution. Workers expressed their determination not to bow down to the British authorities' violence and to continue the anti-persecution struggle until David Trench admits his guilt.

On May 28, compatriots from the banking, trade, publishing, and tourism industries held an indignation meeting, filled with indignation. In the "May 22" large-scale suppression created by the British authorities, more than a hundred people were illegally arrested after being brutally beaten. Participants at the meeting pointed out that in the face of the enemy's bloody suppression, the enthusiasm of Hong Kong patriots for studying Chairman Mao's works has surged. They have fought against the enemy in factories, streets, prisons, "courts," and the "Governor's Mansion," making the enemy's prestige crumble. Participants at the meeting solemnly swore to Chairman Mao: They will definitely carry the anti-persecution struggle to the end. They warned the British "Governor" David Trench: He must unconditionally accept the five demands of China's Foreign Ministry and the four demands of compatriots from various circles. The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with and will definitely settle accounts for the heinous crimes committed by you in Hong Kong. They will not rest until they achieve complete victory.

    采用各种斗争方法对抗港英当局的暴行升级
    香港爱国同胞更加广泛开展反迫害斗争
    新华社香港三十日电　香港同胞反对港英当局迫害的斗争，正在更加广泛地发展起来。二十九日，香港油麻地小轮公司、土瓜湾伟伦纱厂、荃湾南丰纱厂、中央纱厂共四千五百人采取了停航、停工行动，愤怒抗议港英当局对我同胞进行法西斯血腥镇压，决心抗暴到底。
    港英当局为了加紧对香港油麻地小轮公司工人的迫害，二十六日公然派遣便衣特务上船监视工人，妄图破坏他们的反迫害斗争，激起了工人的无比愤怒。二十九日晨，工人们分别在该公司属下的来往于香港和九龙间的八条客轮和汽车渡轮航线的码头上贴出通告，宣布从上午六时至九时停航三小时。他们坚决响应各界反迫害斗争委员会和各业工人反迫害斗争委员会的号召，采用各种斗争方法对抗港英当局的暴行升级。他们豪迈地说：“这天是毛泽东思想的天，地是毛泽东思想的地，海也是毛泽东思想的海！”工人们表示决心斗争到底。
    停航的渡轮全部停泊在油麻地避风塘及九龙湾内。工人们在船上张贴大幅标语：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“抗议港英法西斯暴行！”“立即释放被无理拘捕的爱国同胞！”这些大标语从船头贴到船尾。
    九时整，海面汽笛齐鸣，宣告三小时停航抗议胜利结束。当渡轮徐徐开出码头的时候，九龙公共汽车工人和“天星”渡轮工人不断响起号音，轮上搭客热烈鼓掌，向油麻地小轮公司工人致敬。
    香港伟伦纱厂、南丰纱厂和中央纱厂三家纺织厂二千七百名工人，二十九日日夜三班每班分别停工两小时至四小时。工人们在工厂内外贴上了抗暴标语，并分别举行了反对港英迫害斗争大会。工人们纷纷表示，不在港英当局的暴力下低头，一定要把反迫害斗争进行到底，直至戴麟趾低头认罪。
    香港银行、贸易、出版和旅游等业同胞怀着无比愤怒的心情，在二十八日举行控诉大会。这几个行业的同胞在港英当局制造的“五·二二”大镇压中，有一百多人在遭到疯狂毒打后被非法逮捕。出席大会的同胞指出，面对敌人的血腥镇压，香港爱国同胞学习毛主席著作的热潮更加高涨，他们同敌人在厂里、街上、监狱、“法庭”和“总督府”等地进行了针锋相对的斗争，使敌人威风扫地。出席大会的同胞向毛主席庄严宣誓：一定要把反迫害斗争进行到底。他们警告港英“总督”戴麟趾：必须无条件接受我国外交部的五项要求和各界同胞的四项要求。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人是不好惹的，一定要彻底清算你们在香港犯下的滔天罪行，不获全胜，誓不罢休。
