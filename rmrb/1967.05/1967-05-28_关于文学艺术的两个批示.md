		On Two Directives Concerning Literature and Art
		Mao Zedong

		I. Directive of December 12, 1963

		Various forms of art—drama, folk arts, music, fine arts, dance, film, poetry, and literature, etc.—have many problems, and there are many people involved. The socialist transformation in many departments has so far yielded very little. Many departments are still dominated by "dead people." We cannot underestimate the achievements of films, new poetry, folk songs, fine arts, and novels, but there are also many problems within them. As for departments like drama, the problems are even greater. The economic base has already changed, but one of the superstructures serving this base, the art departments, still has big problems. This requires starting from investigations and research, and seriously taking it up.

		Many communists enthusiastically advocate feudalist and capitalist art, but do not enthusiastically advocate socialist art. Is this not strange?

		II. Directive of June 27, 1964

		These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have, for the most part, not implemented the party's policies over the past fifteen years. They have acted like officials and lords, not going to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not reflecting the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even slipped to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become, on some future day, like the Petőfi Club in Hungary.

    关于文学艺术的两个批示
    毛泽东 
    一，一九六三年十二月十二日的批示
    各种艺术形式——戏剧、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、电影、诗和文学等等，问题不少，人数很多，社会主义改造在许多部门中，至今收效甚微。许多部门至今还是“死人”统治着。不能低估电影、新诗、民歌、美术、小说的成绩，但其中的问题也不少。至于戏剧等部门，问题就更大了。社会经济基础已经改变了，为这个基础服务的上层建筑之一的艺术部门，至今还是大问题。这需要从调查研究着手，认真地抓起来。
    许多共产党人热心提倡封建主义和资本主义的艺术，却不热心提倡社会主义的艺术，岂非咄咄怪事。
    二，一九六四年六月二十七日的批示
    这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。
