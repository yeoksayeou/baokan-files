We resolutely repelled the black wind of capitalist restoration. The Party branch secretary and militia instructor of Jinxing Production Brigade, Xiyu People's Commune, Gaixian County, Liaoning Province, Xú Chóngràng, writes:

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will." However, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party sings a different tune from our great leader Chairman Mao. Over the past seventeen years, a small clique led by him has stirred up one evil wind after another in the countryside, attempting to restore capitalism and push us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the bitter sea of "eating husks and grass, being treated like cattle and horses."

We deeply understand that in the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants were poor because of private ownership, and we suffered because of class exploitation. Today, our lives are getting better and better, and this is because of the socialist public ownership system and because we laboring people are the masters of the socialist system. For this reason, over the past seventeen years, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our Jinxing Brigade have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, continuously resisting the revisionist evil winds, repelling the capitalist restorationist tide, and determined to follow Chairman Mao on the broad and smooth road of socialism. Our resolve to walk the socialist road has long been made. In 1947, during the land reform, we established two collective orchards based on Chairman Mao's teaching of "organizing together." In 1953, we established a primary cooperative. At that time, under the influence of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, some people said, "Now, establishing a primary cooperative has no experience and cannot be universally promoted," and did not approve our establishment of a primary cooperative. But we thought, cooperativization is proposed by Chairman Mao, and listening to Chairman Mao's words is safe and reliable; plus, we had six or seven years of experience in running collective orchards, so we voluntarily established a cooperative. That year, our cooperative achieved a bumper harvest of grain and fruit. In this way, through the primary cooperative, advanced cooperative, and up to the commune, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in our Jinxing Brigade have run swiftly on the broad and smooth road of socialism.

The process of consolidating and strengthening the socialist collective economy is a process of sharp and complex class struggle between two classes and two roads. After cooperativization, in response to the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the spokesmen for rural capitalism advocated unlimited "less deduction, more distribution," claiming that "only more distribution can demonstrate the superiority of the collective economy and mobilize everyone's enthusiasm." They attempted to eat up and divide everything, aiming to ruin the collective economy. Based on Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, we resisted this evil wind and correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, improving the lives of the commune members while gradually increasing the public accumulation. Since cooperativization, relying on self-reliance, we have successively set up seventeen miles of high and low voltage power lines and drilled twelve electric deep wells, achieving full mechanization of irrigation from orchards to dry fields. With the active support of the state, we have also purchased cars and tractors; we have also set up grain processing plants, kilns, brick kilns, and quarries, making the collective economy more prosperous.

During the three years of difficulty, the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party again peddled "three freedoms and one contract" and other black goods. Our brigade was also affected, and at that time, some people advocated selling market-priced vegetables in the free market to increase "income." As soon as these so-called "suggestions" were put forward, they were strongly refuted by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone said, "We want socialism and will not allow capitalism to spread!"

Over the past seventeen years, our Jinxing Brigade has withstood one severe class struggle test after another, striding forward on the broad and smooth road of socialism. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party attempts to let the three big mountains oppress us again, which is a futile wish. We poor and lower-middle peasants have decided to walk the bright road of socialism.

    我们坚决打退了资本主义复辟的黑风
    辽宁省盖县熊岳公社金星大队党支部书记、民兵指导员　徐崇让
    毛主席教导我们说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。”而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，却和我们伟大领袖毛主席唱反调。十七年来，以他为首的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在农村刮起一阵又一阵妖风，妄想复辟资本主义，把我们贫下中农重新推到“吃糠咽菜，当牛做马”的苦海里去。
    我们深深懂得，过去我们贫下中农穷就穷在私有制上，苦就苦在阶级剥削这条毒根上。今天，我们日子越过越好了，好就好在社会主义公有制上，好就好在咱们劳动人民当家作主的社会主义制度上。正因为这样，十七年来，我们金星大队广大贫下中农坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，不断地顶住修正主义的妖风，打退资本主义复辟的逆流，决心跟着毛主席走社会主义的康庄大道。我们走社会主义道路的决心早就下定了。一九四七年土改时，我们就根据毛主席“组织起来”的教导，成立了两个集体果园。一九五三年又成立了初级社。当时在党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的影响下，某些人说什么“现在办初级社没有经验，不能全面推广”，不批准我们成立初级社。可是我们想，合作化是毛主席他老人家提出来的，听毛主席的话保险没错；加上又有办了六、七年集体果园的经验，我们就自动办起了合作社。当年我们的合作社就获得粮、果大丰收。就这样，经过初级社、高级社，一直到公社化，我们金星大队广大贫下中农，在社会主义的康庄大道上跑得飞快。
    巩固和壮大社会主义集体经济的过程，就是尖锐复杂的两个阶级、两条道路斗争的过程。合作化以后，和党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派相呼应，农村资本主义的代言人主张无限度的“少扣多分”，胡说什么“只有多分才能体现集体经济的优越性，调动大伙的干劲。”妄图吃净分光，把集体经济搞垮。我们根据毛主席一贯的教导，顶住了这股妖风，正确地处理了国家、集体和个人三方面的关系，在改善社员生活的同时，逐年扩大了公共积累。从合作化以来，我们依靠自力更生，先后架设了十七华里长的高低压线路，打成十二眼电力深井，从果园到旱田全面实现了机井水利化。在国家的积极支援下，我们又购置了汽车、拖拉机；还办起了粮谷加工厂、烘炉、砖窑、采石场等，集体经济越来越兴旺。
    在三年困难时期，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派又抛出了“三自一包”等等黑货。我们队里也受到影响，当时有人主张到自由市场上卖议价菜，增加“收入”。这些所谓“建议”一提出，就遭到了广大贫下中农的有力回击。大家说：“我们要的是社会主义，决不许资本主义泛滥！”
    十七年来，我们金星大队经受住了一次又一次严峻的阶级斗争考验，沿着社会主义的康庄大道阔步前进。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，企图让三座大山重新压在我们头上，这是痴心妄想。社会主义这条光明大道，我们贫下中农走定了。
