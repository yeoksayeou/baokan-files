The publication of another brilliant historical document by our great leader Chairman Mao, guiding the cultural revolution—“On the Question of Research on *Dream of the Red Chamber*”—has provided a powerful ideological weapon to the hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the nation who are engaged in a revolutionary critique of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cultural workers, and Red Guards across the country have emphasized that Chairman Mao cares most deeply about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attaches the greatest importance to class struggle in the ideological sphere, and cherishes and supports the revolutionary young people and all new forces. Today, after studying Chairman Mao’s great instructions, we must raise the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural and artistic circles, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary academic “authorities,” and thoroughly eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. We will strive for a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital, as well as the Red Guards, are overjoyed and say that Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat. Workers from the Beijing Coke Chemical Factory Red Rebel Corps said, “The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists they protect use the power they have usurped to obstruct the criticism of bourgeois reactionary academic ‘authorities’ in every way and to suppress the ‘small figures.’ This is essentially the bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat, an attempt to restore capitalism. Today, with Chairman Mao backing us and Mao Zedong Thought as our most powerful ideological weapon, our capabilities are immense. We have exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists they protect, and their so-called ‘big figures.’ This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought!” Beijing Municipal Agricultural Representatives Conference Standing Committee member and deputy battalion commander of the People’s Militia, Wang Chunjiang from Dongshaogou Brigade, Miyun County, said, “The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and a handful of reactionary academic ‘authorities,’ are all paper tigers. The proletarian ‘small figures’ who grasp Mao Zedong Thought have defeated the bourgeois ‘big figures’ representing reactionary and decadent forces. This is the dialectic of historical development, an objective law that cannot be resisted forever. Red Guards from Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Beijing Institute of Technology, among other leading universities in the capital, enthusiastically hailed the public release of Chairman Mao’s letter. They said, this is another heavy artillery shell aimed at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary academic ‘authorities,’ and it is the most powerful driving force to push the revolutionary criticism movement to new heights.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary Red Guards in Shanghai said that Chairman Mao’s immortal historical document is another powerful programmatic document guiding our proletarian cultural revolution. A responsible person from the Red Guards of Fudan University said, “During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road threw out the bourgeois reactionary line, labeling revolutionary young people as ‘counter-revolutionaries’ and attempting to maintain their shaky counter-revolutionary revisionist rule by suppressing the ‘small figures.’ However, they have lifted the stone only to drop it on their own feet, and their plot has completely failed. Whoever dares to block the forward march of history, whoever dares to suppress the ‘small figures,’ will surely be crushed by the wheel of historical progress and will surely be defeated by the ‘small figures.’”

The revolutionary young people of the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards of Shandong University held a mass rally and parade last night to celebrate the release of Chairman Mao’s letter. They expressed their determination to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois academic authorities, and to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought across all domains of the political and ideological front.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary young people, and revolutionary cultural workers in Heilongjiang Province, Shanxi Province, and the Guiyang region enthusiastically hailed the public release of another great document by our great leader Chairman Mao. Workers from the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, moved, said, “More than ten years ago, our great leader Chairman Mao fully supported two ‘small figures’ in their attack on bourgeois reactionary academic ‘authorities’; more than ten years later, today, when tens of millions of ‘small figures’ are displaying the revolutionary rebel spirit of ‘daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse’ and launching a fierce general assault on the seemingly powerful ‘big figures’—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—Chairman Mao has once again given us, the proletarian revolutionaries, the greatest encouragement, the greatest support, and the greatest care. With Chairman Mao backing us, we will surely be able to drive those ‘big figures’ who are strong on the outside but weak on the inside—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—off the historical stage.”

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People’s Liberation Army are overjoyed by the public release of this great document by Chairman Mao. They repeatedly shout, “Long live the victory of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line! Long live Chairman Mao!” They say, Chairman Mao’s letter is another treasure in the treasury of Marxism-Leninism.

    全国亿万军民热烈欢呼毛主席《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》的发表
    高举革命批判大旗把文化大革命推向新高潮
    掌握毛泽东思想的无产阶级“小人物”，定能彻底战胜资产阶级“大人物”
    据新华社二十七日讯　我们伟大领袖毛主席指导文化革命的又一光辉历史文件——《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》的发表，给正在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命大批判的全国亿万军民，送来了威力无穷的强大思想武器。各地的工农兵群众、革命的文艺工作者和红卫兵小将强调指出：毛主席最最关怀无产阶级文化大革命，最最重视意识形态领域内里的阶级斗争，最最爱护并支持革命小将和一切新生力量。今天，我们学习了毛主席的伟大指示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判文化艺术界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，彻底批判资产阶级的反动学术“权威”，彻底肃清资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的影响，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利和巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。
    首都广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将欢欣鼓舞地说，毛主席是最伟大的无产阶级革命家。北京炼焦化学厂职工红色造反团的战士说，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他庇护下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用他们窃取的权力，百般阻挠对资产阶级反动学术“权威”的批判，专“小人物”的政，这实质上就是对无产阶级实行资产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义。今天，我们有毛主席撑腰，有毛泽东思想这个最强大的思想武器，我们的本领大得很，我们把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来了，把他们庇护下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子揪出来了，把他们所谓的“大人物”一个个揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！北京市农代会常委、密云县东邵渠公社高各庄大队民兵副营长王春江说，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和彭真、陆定一、周扬等反革命修正主义分子，以及一小撮反动学术“权威”，统统是纸老虎。掌握毛泽东思想的无产阶级“小人物”战胜了代表反动腐朽势力的资产阶级“大人物”，这是历史发展的辩证法，这是永远不可抗拒的客观规律。新北大、北京师范大学、北京矿业学院等首都高等院校的红卫兵小将们，热烈欢呼毛主席这封信的公开发表。他们说，这是射向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”的又一颗重型炮弹，是把革命的大批判运动推向新高潮的最最强大的动力。
    上海广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命的红卫兵小将说，毛主席的这篇不朽的历史文献，是指导我们进行无产阶级文化革命的又一个威力巨大的纲领性文件。复旦大学红卫兵师的负责人说，无产阶级文化大革命中，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派抛出资产阶级反动路线，把革命小将打成“反革命”，妄图通过镇压“小人物”来维持自己摇摇欲坠的反革命修正主义统治。但是，他们搬起石头砸了自己的脚，他们的阴谋彻底破产了。谁敢阻挡历史前进的洪流，谁敢打击“小人物”，谁就一定会被历史前进的巨轮所碾碎，一定会被“小人物”所打倒。
    山东大学毛泽东思想红卫兵的革命小将，昨晚连夜举行群众大会和游行，热烈庆祝毛主席的信的发表。他们表示，毛主席这封信的发表，使我们从中汲取了无穷无尽的精神力量。我们决心高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级学术权威的反，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍政治思想战线的各个领域。
    黑龙江省、山西省和贵阳地区的广大工农兵、革命小将和革命文艺工作者，热烈欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席的又一个伟大文件的公开发表。太原机车车辆厂的无产阶级革命派激动地说，十多年前，我们伟大领袖毛主席全力支持了两个“小人物”向资产阶级反动学术“权威”开火；十多年后的今天，当千千万万的“小人物”发扬“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的革命造反精神，向貌似强大的“大人物”——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动猛烈的总攻击的时候，毛主席又给了我们无产阶级革命派最大的鼓舞，最大的支持，最大的关怀。有毛主席他老人家给我们撑腰，我们一定能够把那些外强中干的“大人物”——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派统统赶下历史舞台。
    人民解放军广大指战员对毛主席的这一伟大文件的公开发表无不欢欣鼓舞，他们一遍又一遍地高呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！毛主席万岁！”他们说，毛主席的这封信是马克思列宁主义宝库中又一颗珍宝。
