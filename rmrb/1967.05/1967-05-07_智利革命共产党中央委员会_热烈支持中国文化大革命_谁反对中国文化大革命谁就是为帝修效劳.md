The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile recently wrote a letter expressing strong support and praise for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution underway in our country under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China. The letter enthusiastically extols the great thought of Mao Zedong.

The letter states: We, the Revolutionary Communist Party of Chile, firmly and enthusiastically support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China.

The letter says: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is the greatest revolution of our time, comparable only to the October Revolution and the Chinese Revolution itself. The rise and victorious development of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great victory for Marxism-Leninism and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

	“All the imperialists, reactionaries, and revisionists in the world are so frantically attacking and slandering the Cultural Revolution. This fully proves to the peoples of our various countries the depth and importance of this historic struggle of the Chinese Cultural Revolution; it shows what interests it is defending and what interests it is striking at; it helps people clearly distinguish the camp of imperialism and the bourgeoisie from the revolutionary camp of the proletariat; it points to a great international-scale class struggle; it points to the international nature of the proletarian revolution and the internationalist duty of the proletariat.”

The letter states: Whoever opposes or attempts to belittle the great significance of the Chinese Cultural Revolution is serving the imperialists and revisionists and will ultimately become historical garbage like them.

The letter enthusiastically praises Chairman Mao as the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world.

The letter says: Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the Chinese people stand at the forefront of the revolutionary peoples of all countries. Comrade Mao Zedong personally leads the Chinese people in this great struggle, setting a firm and decisive example for us, an example of responsibility and revolutionary daring. Our people will express our support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China through our own revolutionary struggle.

The letter says: No matter how the U.S. imperialists and modern revisionists scream anti-China slogans, their actions only reveal to the peoples of various countries who the enemies of the people are, who wants to defeat imperialism, and who is in cahoots with imperialism; who supports the anti-imperialist fighters, and who supports the imperialists. The letter concludes: The waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China are shaking the old palaces of the bourgeoisie. While the exploiters tremble in fear, praying to the gods for help, the peoples of various countries are breathing the fresh air of the Cultural Revolution and marching forward with vigor.

    智利革命共产党中央委员会
    热烈支持中国文化大革命
    谁反对中国文化大革命谁就是为帝修效劳
    本报讯　智利革命共产党中央委员会不久前写信热烈支持和赞扬我国无产阶级文化大革命，热情颂扬伟大的毛泽东思想。
    这封信写道：我们代表智利革命共产党对于中国人民在毛泽东同志和中国共产党的领导下正在进行的无产阶级文化大革命，表示坚决的热烈的支持。
    信中说：中国的无产阶级文化大革命，是当代最伟大的革命，只有十月革命和中国革命本身才可与之比拟。这次无产阶级文化大革命的兴起和胜利发展，是马克思列宁主义的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
      “全世界的帝国主义、反动派和修正主义者如此疯狂地攻击和诽谤文化大革命，这就向我们各国人民充分证明了中国文化革命这个历史性的斗争的深度及其重要的意义；说明了文化大革命是捍卫什么利益和打击什么利益的，帮助了人们毫不含糊地分清帝国主义—资产阶级的阵营和无产阶级的革命的阵营；指明了一个巨大的国际规模的阶级斗争；指明了无产阶级革命的国际性质及无产阶级的国际主义义务。”
    信中写道：谁反对或企图抹煞中国文化大革命的重大的意义，谁就是为帝国主义者和修正主义者效劳，而最终会象帝修那样成为历史的垃圾。
    信中热情赞扬毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。
    信中说：在毛泽东同志领导下，中国人民站在各国革命人民的前列。毛泽东同志亲自领导中国人民进行这场伟大的斗争，对我们是一个坚定果断的榜样，是责任心和革命胆略的榜样。我国人民要用自己的革命斗争来表示我们对中国无产阶级文化革命的声援。
    信中说：不管美帝国主义和现代修正主义怎样进行反华叫嚣，他们这种勾当只能向各国人民表明到底谁是人民的敌人，是谁要打败帝国主义，是谁和帝国主义结合在一起；是谁支持反帝的战士，是谁支持帝国主义者。来信最后说：中国无产阶级文化大革命的风浪震撼了资产阶级的旧殿宇。当剥削者胆战心惊地祷告鬼神保佑的时候，各国人民正在呼吸文化大革命的清新空气而奋勇前进。
