The cries of "Love of country is no crime, resistance to tyranny is justified" have echoed through the skies of Hong Kong in recent days. Under the strong support of the 700 million people of our motherland and guided by the great thought of Chairman Mao, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong are fighting bravely against persecution.

Due to the deliberate escalation of the situation by the Hong Kong British authorities, who are preparing to further suppress our Hong Kong compatriots with bloodshed, the British "Governor" David Trench has shown no sincerity and has refused to meet with representatives from various sectors over the past few days. This has sparked even greater indignation among all patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. On the 18th, representatives from more than sixty organizations, including unions, schools, the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, newspapers, film companies, banks, and trading companies, streamed to the British "Governor's Residence" to protest from morning till night. The Hong Kong British authorities deployed helicopters and a large number of police. The iron gates of the British "Governor's Residence" were locked with heavy chains, leaving only a narrow gap. Trench ordered an "aide" to have the representatives stuff the protest letter through the gap as if it were a "petition," which immediately met with strong protests from the crowd. Angry protesters pasted protest letters written on big-character posters on the iron gates and walls of the "Governor's Residence."

Nearly one hundred bus, taxi, and truck drivers parked their vehicles, adorned with slogans, in front of the streets of the "Governor's Residence" to express their strong protest against the Hong Kong British authorities. They joined other representatives on the scene to shout slogans and sing revolutionary songs.

When the seventeen representatives of the Committee for the Struggle Against British Persecution in Hong Kong and Kowloon arrived at the gates of the British "Governor's Residence," the crowd erupted in thunderous applause. The representatives strongly protested the bloody atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities. However, Trench, like the day before, continued to ignore the solemn demands of the four million Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, refusing to meet with them and accept the protest letter. Trench's attitude further enraged the crowd. Yang Guang, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Council, spoke to reporters on the spot, strongly protesting Trench's stubborn and unyielding attitude. He pointed out: Now, Trench, with his reactionary actions, has once again shown us that he has no intention of repenting for the heinous crimes of bloody suppression against our patriotic compatriots, nor does he have any sincerity in solving the problem. What they call "maintaining peace and order" is to further carry out fascist suppression. What they say "must be answered by the British government in London" is to wash their hands of the bloody crimes and to decide to be enemies of the four million Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million great people of China to the end. Yang Guang said, Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is impossible to hope that imperialists and Chinese reactionaries will show mercy and turn back. The only way is to organize forces and fight against them." We must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, strengthen our unity, persist in the struggle, and carry the struggle against persecution to the end.

Recently, Hong Kong British police have repeatedly beaten reporters from the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, the "Ta Kung Pao," and the "Wen Wei Po," and in the early hours of the 16th, they deliberately provoked the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency by stopping and insulting staff near the branch. For this reason, the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency sent representatives for the third time on the 18th to protest to the British "Governor" Trench. Trench has consistently adopted an indifferent attitude towards the representatives of our branch, refusing to meet with them for two consecutive days on the 17th and 18th. The representatives of our branch are extremely indignant at the stubborn attitude of the Hong Kong British authorities. They read the protest letter to the compatriots present at the gates of the British "Governor's Residence" and pasted a large-character protest letter on the iron gates of the "Governor's Residence."

Yesterday, the strongest voices from Beijing, the capital of our great socialist motherland, denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities, inspired the Hong Kong compatriots who are steadfastly fighting against persecution, giving them boundless encouragement and making their fighting spirit more soaring. The live broadcast of the rally of 100,000 revolutionary masses in Beijing by the Central People's Broadcasting Station yesterday afternoon spread to every corner of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Hong Kong patriotic compatriots, indoors and outdoors, gathered around radios and loudspeakers, listening with boundless excitement and emotion to the powerful voices of their compatriots in the motherland, singing revolutionary songs and shouting, "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live, long, long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao!" After listening to the broadcast, workers from many units immediately held rallies to swear to fight against persecution. The workers said with excitement, "Hearing the very affectionate voices of our compatriots in the motherland makes us full of energy. This is the greatest support and encouragement from Chairman Mao and the 700 million people of our great socialist motherland for our struggle against persecution. The people of our motherland are our strong backing, and they are heart to heart with us, making us full of confidence to strive for victory." A group of students wrote in a letter to the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po," "With Chairman Mao backing us up and Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will surely be able to defeat the American imperialists and their running dogs, the British imperialists! We must make the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought shine even more brilliantly in Hong Kong and Kowloon!"

The compatriots in Macao firmly support the struggle of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots against persecution. They angrily surrounded the British Consul, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities in persecuting Hong Kong compatriots. The picture shows the British Consul's embarrassed state. "Determined to overcome all difficulties, we will strive for victory." The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong, undaunted by the enemy's various murderous weapons, hold hands and bravely persist in the struggle.

    爱国无罪　抗暴有理
    香港爱国同胞在毛泽东思想指引下，在祖国七亿人民声援下，英勇进行反迫害斗争
    新华社香港十九日电　“爱国无罪，抗暴有理”的怒吼声，连日来响彻香港上空。香港爱国同胞在祖国七亿人民的强大声援下，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，斗志昂扬，决心把反迫害的正义斗争进行到底。
    由于港英当局蓄意继续扩大事态，准备对我香港同胞进一步进行血腥镇压，港英“总督”戴麟趾又毫无诚意，连日来拒不接见各界代表，激起了全香港爱国同胞更大的愤慨。十八日，工会、学校、新华社香港分社、报馆、电影公司、银行和贸易公司等六十多个单位的代表，从早到晚川流不息地前往港英“总督府”抗议。港英当局出动了直升飞机和大批警察。港英“总督府”的铁门用铁链重重锁住，只留下一条窄缝。戴麟趾指使一名“副官”要代表们把抗议书当做“请愿书”从门缝塞进去，立即遭到群众的强烈抗议。愤怒的群众纷纷把用大字报写成的抗议书贴在“总督府”的铁门和墙壁上。
    近一百名公共汽车、出租汽车和货车司机，把贴着标语的车子摆在“总督府”前面街道上，表示对港英当局的强烈抗议。他们同在场的其他代表一起高呼口号，高唱革命歌曲。
    当港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会的十七位代表来到港英“总督府”门前的时候，群众中爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。代表们就港英当局一手制造的血腥暴行提出最强烈的抗议。但戴麟趾同前一天一样，继续漠视四百万香港中国同胞的严正要求，拒不接见，避不接受抗议书。戴麟趾的态度引起群众更大的愤慨。港九工会联合会理事长杨光当场对各报记者发表谈话，对戴麟趾这种冥顽不灵、死硬到底的态度提出最最强烈的抗议。他指出：现在，戴麟趾以自己的反动行径，再一次向我们表明，他对自己所犯下的血腥镇压我爱国同胞的滔天罪行，毫无悔改之意，毫无诚意解决问题。他们所说的“维持和平与秩序”，就是要进一步实行法西斯镇压。他们所说的“必须由伦敦英国政府答复”，就是要把血腥罪行推得一干二净，而决心与全香港四百万中国同胞为敌到底，与七亿伟大的中国人民为敌到底。杨光说，毛主席教导我们：“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。我们一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，加强团结，坚持斗争，把反迫害斗争进行到底。
    港英警察最近接连殴打新华社香港分社、《大公报》和《文汇报》记者，并且在十六日凌晨二时蓄意向新华社香港分社挑衅，在分社附近截查和侮辱分社工作人员。为此，新华社香港分社在十八日第三次派出工作人员代表，向港英“总督”戴麟趾提出严正抗议。戴麟趾对我分社工作人员代表的严正抗议，一直采取漠视的态度，十七、十八日接连两天拒绝见我分社工作人员代表。我分社工作人员代表对港英当局的顽固态度极为愤慨，他们在港英“总督府”门前向在场的同胞宣读了抗议书，并把一张大字抗议书贴在“总督府”的铁门上。
    昨天，来自伟大社会主义祖国首都北京亲人声讨港英当局法西斯暴行的最强音，激励着正在坚持反迫害斗争的香港同胞，使他们受到无限鼓舞，斗志更加昂扬。中央人民广播电台昨天下午转播的北京十万革命群众集会的实况，传遍港九每一个角落。香港爱国同胞们在屋里、在街道上，围着收音机和扩声器，以无比兴奋和激动的心情，倾听祖国亲人强有力的声音，和亲人一起高唱革命歌曲，高呼“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”许多单位的职工在收听广播后，马上举行了反迫害斗争誓师大会。职工们怀着激动的心情说，听到祖国亲人无比亲切的声音，使我们浑身都是劲，这是毛主席和伟大社会主义祖国七亿人民对我们反迫害斗争的最大支持，最大鼓舞。祖国人民做我们的强大后盾，和我们心连心，使我们信心百倍地去争取胜利。一群学生在给香港《文汇报》的信中说，“有毛主席给我们撑腰，有毛泽东思想做武器，我们一定能够挫败美帝及其帮凶英帝国主义！我们一定要让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在港九放射出更加灿烂辉煌的金光！”
