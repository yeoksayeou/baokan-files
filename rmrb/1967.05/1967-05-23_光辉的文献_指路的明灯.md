The May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966 ignited the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and sounded the charge for a total offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This brilliant document, personally drafted by Chairman Mao, is the guiding beacon for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Last February, Peng Zhen's "Draft Outline" was the black program of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique and their backstage boss, the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to impose bourgeois dictatorship on the revolutionary masses. It was their manifesto for a counterattack and a restoration of capitalism. This Circular thoroughly smashed the evil plot of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and dealt a fatal blow to the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, announcing the approaching end of their days. This Circular will be recorded in the brilliant annals of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the Circular, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those in authority taking the capitalist road are still nestling within the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles, are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them have already been recognized and others not yet. Some are still being groomed as our successors, like Khrushchov, they are now lying in wait, biding their time. All levels of Party committees must pay full attention to this." Over the past year, the broad revolutionary masses, following the great teachings of Chairman Mao, have carried out a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, solving the problem of seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the organs of proletarian dictatorship, consolidating the proletarian dictatorship in our country, smashing the plots of imperialism and modern revisionism to subvert our country, and opening up a new epoch in the international communist movement.

Now it is exactly one year since the Circular was issued. Recall the struggles of the past year, and we feel even more deeply the closeness of this brilliant document.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses in our factory have launched a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Relying on their power, they spread dark winds, shouting that "monsters and demons have emerged, the rightists are rebelling." They set the tone and drew the lines, directing the spearhead at the revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses broke through their nets, putting them in a shaky and isolated position. Just as the revolutionary masses were achieving victory after victory, the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party hurriedly sent in work teams, pushing the bourgeois reactionary line, attacking the revolutionary masses, and suppressing the revolutionary mass movement.

Just as a white terror was spreading throughout the factory, we revolutionary masses heard, by radio, the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao. We were moved to tears and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of life to Chairman Mao!" It was Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that liberated us. Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. If it were not for Chairman Mao, we revolutionary masses would long ago have become prisoners of bourgeois dictatorship.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolutionary masses in our factory thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary masses went from being a minority to a majority, from having absolute political superiority to absolute organizational superiority, and from being scattered to forming a great alliance. Inspired by the January Revolution in Shanghai, the revolutionary masses in our factory carried out a great alliance and seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, establishing a temporary power organ of the "three-in-one combination."

After seizing power, the revolutionary masses responded to the great call of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," bravely shouldering the double burden of revolution and production. They washed away all the dirt and filth on the stamps, thoroughly criticizing those stamps that propagated emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, dead people, ancient people, flowers, and fish, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We are determined to make Mao Zedong Thought occupy the stamp front, to make our stamps serve socialism politically and ideologically, and to serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Under the efforts of the revolutionary masses and all the workers in the factory, the radiant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and the golden Mao Zedong Quotations stamps appeared before the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. From then on, our country's stamps took on a new look.

After seizing power, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "we are not only good at destroying an old world, we are also good at building a new world." We mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, and broke away from the old set of revisionist management systems, initially establishing a new proletarian management system for enterprises and a new revolutionary order. We reduced a large number of management cadres and sent them to the production front line, relatively solving the problem of new leading cadres not leaving labor. All of this mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, greatly liberated the productive forces, and promoted the vigorous development of production, continuously completing the state production tasks for four months.

All of this is the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Today, the public release of the May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966 enables us revolutionary masses to see more clearly that the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party is the backstage boss of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, the Khrushchov of China who is sleeping beside Chairman Mao. The bourgeois reactionary line he pushes is the continuation and development of the "Draft Outline." Therefore, it has aroused even greater indignation and hatred in us towards the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party.

Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, we must concentrate all our efforts to criticize the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, seize back all the positions occupied by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and expose all the big and small Khrushchov-like figures, so that the red land of socialism will never change color for thousands of years, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in every field!

    光辉的文献　指路的明灯
    北京邮票厂革命造反总部
    中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，吹响了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派实行总攻击的进军号。毛主席亲自主持制定的这个马克思列宁主义的光辉文献，是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯。
    去年二月，彭真抛出来的《汇报提纲》，是彭真反革命修正主义集团及其后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，对无产阶级革命派实行资产阶级专政的黑纲领，是他们反攻倒算，实行资本主义复辟的宣言书。这个《通知》，彻底粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪恶阴谋，给党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以致命的打击，宣告了他们末日的即将到来。这个《通知》，将列入无产阶级文化大革命的光辉史册。
    毛主席在《通知》中指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”一年来，广大的革命群众，遵循着伟大领袖毛主席的教导，进行了轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，解决了向无产阶级专政机构内部一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的问题，巩固了我国的无产阶级专政，粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国进行颠覆活动的阴谋，开辟了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。
    现在正好是《通知》发出的一周年。回忆这一年来的斗争经历，我们更感到这一光辉文献的无比亲切。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们厂的广大革命群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了猛烈的攻击。他们依仗手中的大权，大刮阴风，叫嚷什么“牛鬼蛇神出笼了，右派要翻天了”。他们定调调，划框框，把矛头指向革命群众。革命群众冲决了他们的罗网，使他们处于摇摇欲坠，孤立无援的境地。正当革命群众取得节节胜利之际，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，急急忙忙派出了工作组，推行资产阶级反动路线，围攻无产阶级革命派，镇压革命的群众运动。
    正当白色恐怖笼罩全厂的时候，我们无产阶级革命派在收音机旁，听见了毛主席他老人家亲自主持制定的《十六条》，我们热泪满眶，高呼毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线解放了我们。爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，要是没有毛主席，我们无产阶级革命派早就成为资产阶级专政的阶下囚了。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，我厂无产阶级革命派狠批了资产阶级反动路线，无产阶级革命派从少数变成多数，从政治上的绝对优势到组织上的绝对优势，从分散到大联合。在上海“一月革命”风暴的鼓舞下，我厂无产阶级革命派实行了革命的大联合，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，成立了“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    夺权后，无产阶级革命派，响应伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，勇敢地挑起了革命生产两副重担，荡涤了邮票上的一切污泥浊水，彻底批判了那些宣扬帝王将相、才子佳人、死人古人、花草鱼虫等为资本主义复辟作舆论准备的邮票。我们决心使毛泽东思想占领邮票阵地，使我们的邮票在政治上、思想上为社会主义服务，为广大的工农兵服务。在无产阶级革命派与全厂职工努力下，神采奕奕的伟大领袖毛主席像的邮票，金光闪闪的毛主席语录邮票，同广大的工农兵见面了。从此，我国的邮票出现了一个崭新的面貌。
    夺权后，我们遵照毛主席“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的教导，发动群众，依靠群众，破除了原有的一套修正主义的管理体制，初步建立了崭新的无产阶级管理企业的机构，初步建立了革命的新秩序。精简了大量的管理干部，充实到生产第一线，比较好地解决了新的领导成员不脱离劳动的问题。所有这一切，调动了工人群众的革命积极性，大大解放了生产力，促进了生产的蓬勃发展，连续四个月超额完成了国家生产任务。
    这些都是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利。
    今天，公开发表了中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，使我们无产阶级革命派进一步地看清了，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是彭真反革命修正主义集团的后台，就是睡在毛主席身旁的中国赫鲁晓夫，他所推行的资产阶级反动路线就是《汇报提纲》的继续与发展。因而更加激起了我们对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的无比愤怒，无比憎恨。
    回顾过去，展望未来，我们一定要集中全力批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底清除以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义的流毒，夺回被一小撮反革命修正主义分子盘踞的一切阵地，把大大小小的赫鲁晓夫式人物揪出来示众，使社会主义的红色江山千秋万代永不变色，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在各个领域里高高飘扬！
