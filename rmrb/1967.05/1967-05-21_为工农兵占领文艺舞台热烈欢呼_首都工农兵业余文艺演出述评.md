The storm of Zhongshan Mountain rises, and a million heroes cross the Yangtze River. In the midst of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has entered a decisive battle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a mighty army of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards from the capital has emerged from factories, villages, military units, and schools. They have organized hundreds of cultural cavalry units—Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams—and with high spirits, they have rushed to the streets, to the countryside, to the workshops, and to the fiery battlefields of life. They use art as a weapon and the stage as a battlefield, with the greatest political enthusiasm, to sing praises of our most, most great leader Chairman Mao, to sing praises of the invincible and boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and to sing praises of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. With hearts full of anger, they verbally and in writing, bombard the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, vowing to defend proletarian dictatorship to the death. They raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, fiercely attack the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, seize the stage, and on the revolutionary artistic stage, they shout and sing loudly. The revolutionary drums resonate through the heavens, and the victory songs shake the earth. A revolutionary army of arts has grown and strengthened in the blazing fires of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the struggle against capitalist and revisionist arts. Workers, peasants, and soldiers have proudly ascended the artistic stage. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

I

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion, and first do work in the ideological realm. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." For seventeen years since liberation, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, with the support of the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, have done everything possible to resist Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line and stubbornly pushed a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line. They used their usurped leadership positions to give the green light to anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous weeds, filling the stage with emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, and spirits. They tightly grasped this weapon of literature and art, striving to make the literary and artistic stage a bridgehead for anti-Party, anti-socialist activities, and a propaganda front for the restoration of capitalism.

The golden monkey wields the thousand-pound rod, and the jade sky clears the myriad dust. The workers, peasants, and Red Guards from the capital, who have come from the front lines of the Cultural Revolution, once they rushed onto the stage of literature and art, immediately launched a fierce attack with the most resolute revolutionary spirit and the strongest fighting power against the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power and have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship apparatus. The Red Guards from the capital's colleges and universities performed the "Multiple-Mouth Word" "Down with China's Khrushchev," expressing the indignation of the people across the country in denouncing the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power. The militia of Daxing County, in "Oral and Written Criticism of 'Cultivation'," thoroughly exposed "Cultivation" as a poison that does not want proletarian dictatorship, numbs people's minds, and corrodes people's fighting spirit. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in the poem "Peeling the Skin," peeled off the "old revolutionary" skin of the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, exposing his true face of fake revolution and counter-revolution. To refute and accuse the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is beneficial" advocated by the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, the peasants of Haidian District, in "Vigorously Denouncing the Theory of 'Exploitation is Beneficial'," through the tragic scene of an old poor peasant on the last day of the year, driven to despair and ruin by the landlord's rent and debt collection, brought a blood-curdling accusation against the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev serving the landlords and capitalists. After watching this performance, the audience could not help but clench their fists and shout: "Down with China's Khrushchev! Down with the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power!" The performances by workers, peasants, and Red Guards were short and sharp, sharp and biting, full of strong revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit. They were like daggers, like spears, like grenades, and like hand grenades, all thrown at the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, greatly inspiring the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers, peasants, and soldiers to join the current great criticism. Many commune members, after watching their performances, immediately held meetings to denounce China's Khrushchev. Many workers, after watching the performances, could not suppress their anger, jumped onto the stage, and with their personal experiences, told the story of the blood and tears of the laboring people suffering from the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary classes in the old society. They said: "Chairman Mao leads us on the socialist red path, but China's Khrushchev wants to lead us on the capitalist black path. He is truly a wolf in sheep's clothing! We workers cannot suffer twice! We must thoroughly criticize and expose this poisonous snake! We must defend the iron mountains and rivers of socialism to the death!" "In the past, we only knew how to 'break the branches,' but we did not know how to 'dig the roots.' Now we know that it is this poisonous root that is causing trouble! To uproot a tree, we must dig out the roots. We must wield our hoes and uproot this tree of capitalist restoration, so that it can never grow again on our socialist soil!"

In the epoch-making brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao clearly proposed: "The Party's literary and artistic work is 'a part of the revolutionary cause as a whole,' 'it serves the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party for a certain revolutionary period.'" However, a handful of revisionists in the literary and artistic circles went against this. They used "indirect cooperation" as a cover, refusing to let literature and art serve proletarian politics, actually wanting to serve their restoration of capitalism. They slandered performances that closely cooperated with political tasks as "megaphones," "chasing after trends," and wielded sticks, striving to strangle them. This time, the workers, peasants, and revolutionary young people stood up to this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, closely and timely cooperating with the current political tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, writing and performing on the front lines. They said: "Each of our performances is a big-character poster, only using artistic forms to post it on the stage." This made this amateur performance by workers and peasants truly a battlefield of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Every time Chairman Mao issued a great call, every time a new thing appeared in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it was immediately reflected in their performances. When the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcasted important articles and important news, how many members of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams performing in the countryside, sitting by the radio at night, recorded it word for word, immediately organized study and discussion, and worked all night to write performances. They were afraid of disturbing the commune members' sleep, so they went to the roads and hillsides to practice. The next morning, they performed for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. They said: "If we can let the workers and peasants audience hear Chairman Mao's latest instructions one hour or one minute earlier, that is our greatest happiness and joy!" Performances such as "Revolutionaries Unite, Seize Power," "Grasp Revolution, Promote Production," "The Liberation Army Comes to Our Village," "Correctly Treat Revolutionary Cadres," and "Celebrate the Establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee" all timely cooperated with the current political tasks of the Cultural Revolution, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and greatly dampening the spirit of the bourgeoisie, truly making literature and art "a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy." The handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles, you cursed this as "timeliness," "megaphone," right? Listen: workers, peasants, and soldiers' literature and art is to "respond" to the revolution, to spread the voice of Mao Zedong Thought!

II

The workers, peasants, and Red Guards who have seized the stage of literature and art, with their class feelings of boundless love and admiration for Chairman Mao, use the most resounding songs and the most enthusiastic dances to sing praises of our most, most red red sun in our hearts, to sing praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to sing praises of the brilliant victories of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Every evening party, every performance, all shines with the brilliance of great Mao Zedong Thought. During the performances, the thoughts and feelings of the actors and audience on and off the stage melded into one, and bursts of enthusiastic cheers erupted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!" The soldiers of the Beijing Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team intertwined sculptural art, singing, dancing, solo singing, and dialogue to perform the "Three Articles," making the broad audience re-study the "Three Articles" in the realm of art. The revolutionary young people of the Central Conservatory of Music used singing and dancing to successfully perform Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," winning the enthusiastic welcome of the audience. The small opera "Red Guards Meet Chairman Mao" expressed the joyful feelings of the Red Guards revolutionary young people meeting Chairman Mao at Tiananmen Square. The dance drama "People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America Love Chairman Mao" expressed their unshakable faith and boundless love for Chairman Mao through the bloody struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America on the front lines of the anti-American struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings. The workers, peasants, and Red Guards revolutionary young people said with great enthusiasm: "Every time we beat the drum, every time we strike the gong, every time we sing a song, every time we dance, we must closely connect it with the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought, making the sky Mao Zedong Thought's sky, the earth Mao Zedong Thought's earth, and the people Mao Zedong Thought's armed people!"

Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Whose class to sing praises of, whose class's heroes to create, whose class's figures to occupy the dominant position in literary works and on the artistic stage, this is the focal point of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie on the literary and artistic front. For seventeen years since liberation, the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, together with the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic circles such as Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, and Xia Yan, strived to exclude workers, peasants, and soldiers, attacked workers, peasants, and soldiers, did not allow works to depict the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did not allow the figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers to ascend the stage of literature and art. They loved foreigners, ancients, and the dead, the corpses and rotten flesh of the bourgeoisie and feudalism. To decorate the facade, even if some works described workers, peasants, and soldiers, they were mostly distorted images.

Chairman Mao said: "The people, only the people, are the motive force of world history." Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, in the great winds and waves of class struggle, the workers and peasants of the capital have stridden onto the artistic stage, reversing the history that had been overturned. They sing passionately for the revolution, dance passionately for the revolution, and perform passionately for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad masses of workers and peasants from the production and combat front lines have truly become the masters of culture and art. They said with great enthusiasm: "The revolutionary stage exchanged for by the revolutionary martyrs with their lives and blood, we have stood on it today, and we will stand on it forever!" In their performances, the stage was full of workers wielding hammers, peasants holding hoes, and soldiers gripping rifles, all standing tall, loving Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and socialism without limits. The workers of the factory, after watching their performances, excitedly said: "We saw ourselves on the stage." The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants also said: "You rebels have rebelled well, creating a new stage! In the past, the stage was full of emperors, empresses, Mu Guiying, and Yu Jiangu, but now the stage is full of us, the poor and lower-middle peasants! Chairman Mao has elevated us so high and valued us so much!"

III

Literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers is a fundamental direction issue. For a long time, the handful of capitalists within the Party who are in power, as well as the revisionists in the literary and artistic circles such as Zhou Yang, Lin Moquan, and Xia Yan, on the one hand, ruthlessly cut down the "cultural troupes" of the old Eighth Route Army, pushing literary and artistic workers into the "ivory tower," pushing them into specialized large theaters, making them isolated from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and isolated from the fiery struggle of life, gradually becoming "spiritual aristocrats"; on the other hand, they fiercely attacked the literary and artistic activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers, attacking the amateur groups organized by workers, peasants, and soldiers, leading literature and art into the swamp of serving only a few people and not serving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This time, the workers, peasants, and Red Guards revolutionary young people fiercely attacked the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line. They raised the red flag, carried Chairman Mao's portrait, carried their backpacks, braved the scorching sun, and endured the wind and rain, walking to the streets, factories, military units, fields, remote villages, and the front lines of the struggle. Their stage was set up among the broadest masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They did not let go of Chairman Mao's books, did not let go of Chairman Mao's words, did not let go of Chairman Mao's thoughts, and did not let go of Chairman Mao's teachings. They propagated Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, making the great Mao Zedong Thought take deep root among the broad masses and transform into a great material force. The Beijing Garrison Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to support the left, support industry, and support agriculture, traversing the entire Miyun mountain area. They performed when there were many people and also performed when there were few people. Once, they were walking through a valley when they suddenly saw four commune members working on the mountaintop, so they climbed the mountain without hesitation to perform a special show. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of Daxing County, composed of some militia cadres, heard that a few old peasant grandmothers had difficulty walking, so they specially went to their courtyard to set up the stage and perform. The dozens of Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams composed of Red Guards revolutionary young people from the capital's colleges and universities walked along the ridges every day, and wherever they saw commune members working, they rushed to perform. One day, a little girl watched their performance and said: "Uncle, you performed well. If my grandfather could see it, that would be great!" The young people immediately asked about the reason, and it turned out that her grandfather had carried loads for the landlord for over thirty years, had poor eyesight, and rarely watched performances. The next day, they came to the old man's house to perform, and the audience was only three people in the family. The old man, after watching their performance, was so moved that he cried and tightly held the hands of the revolutionary young people, saying: "You are truly performing for us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, bringing Mao Zedong Thought to the bed! I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words for a lifetime and resolutely overthrow that China's Khrushchev!" The Capital Workers Mao Zedong Thought Red Flag Performance Team, composed of fitters, turners, and truck drivers, went deep into many factory workshops, workshops, canteens, and many rural areas on the outskirts of the city to perform. Some old workers, after watching their performances full of life and revolutionary spirit, cried and said: "You have fought for Chairman Mao, fought for our working class! From you, we see the new face of socialist literature and art!"

The workers, peasants, and soldiers who participated in this propaganda performance, many of them were themselves members of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They came from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and from the front lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They understood the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers the most and understood the needs of the workers, peasants, and soldiers the most. The performances they wrote were also from the fiery class struggle life, full of strong revolutionary fighting spirit. In terms of artistic form, they were short and sharp, vivid and clear, sharp and biting, and popular among the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the performance activities, they read Chairman Mao's books, listened to Chairman Mao's words, and everywhere followed Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as their guide for action. They lived among the masses, labored and fought with the masses, and their thoughts and styles were revolutionary and swift, so they served the workers, peasants, and soldiers well, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers enthusiastically welcomed their performances.

These small teams went deep into the grassroots, performed tours, like a red sowing machine, spreading the seeds of revolutionary literature and art everywhere. Many factories, communes, military units, and schools established their own literary and artistic small teams, using their spare time to create and perform, making the literature and art of workers, peasants, and soldiers more widespread and popular, and developing more vigorously.

The thunder of a thousand pounds opens a new universe, and the east wind of ten thousand miles sweeps away the remaining clouds. The workers, peasants, and Red Guards of the capital, with extremely full political enthusiasm and high revolutionary posture, marched forward with their heads held high, wielding their pens, and ascended the stage of literature and art, becoming the main force of literature and art. They wrote new poems, performed new plays, sang new songs, drew new paintings, and specially created the counter-revolutionary line of emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ancients, dead people, and foreigners. The literature and art of workers, peasants, and soldiers have the broadest mass character, the most resolute revolutionary spirit, and the strongest fighting power. With strong revolutionary content and new artistic forms, they have opened up a new world for socialist literature and art in our country and marked a new era.

The flowers of the mountains are in full bloom, and the spring is in full bloom. Let those revisionist and bourgeois "authorities" wail and cry in front of this blooming "mountain flower"! The literature and art of workers, peasants, and soldiers will definitely bear abundant fruits and shine brightly under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

    为工农兵占领文艺舞台热烈欢呼
    ——首都工农兵业余文艺演出述评
    钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，在纪念毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的前夕，一支由首都的工农兵和红卫兵革命小将组成的浩浩荡荡的文艺大军，从工厂、农村、部队、学校中“杀”出来了。他们组织了数百支文艺轻骑队——毛泽东思想宣传队，意气风发地奔向街头，奔向农村，奔向车间，奔向火热的斗争生活中去。他们把文艺作为武器，把舞台作为战场，以最大的政治热情歌颂我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂战无不胜、光焰无际的毛泽东思想，歌颂以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。他们怀着满腔的愤怒，口诛笔伐，万炮齐轰党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政。他们高举革命批判的旗帜，大造反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反，大夺文艺舞台的权，在革命的艺术舞台上大喊大叫，大唱大跳。革命锣鼓震天响，胜利凯歌动天地。一支革命的文艺大军在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，在同资本主义、修正主义文艺的斗争中成长壮大起来了，工农兵豪迈地登上文艺舞台了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。
    一
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”解放十七年来，文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，千方百计对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义的文艺路线。他们利用窃踞的领导职权，为反党反社会主义的毒草开放绿灯，让帝王将相，才子佳人，鬼怪幽灵充塞着舞台。他们死死抓住文艺这个武器，极力把文艺舞台作为反党反社会主义的桥头堡，作为复辟资本主义的舆论阵地。
    金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。来自文化大革命前线的首都工农兵和红卫兵革命小将，当他们一冲上文艺舞台，就以最坚定的革命性，最强大的战斗力，对混入无产阶级专政机构的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，发起了猛烈的进攻。首都大专院校红卫兵革命小将演出的“多口词”《打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫》，表达了全国人民同仇敌忾，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的心情。大兴县民兵在《口诛笔伐批〈修养〉》中，全面深刻地揭露了《修养》是一剂不要无产阶级专政，麻醉人们心灵，腐蚀人们斗志的毒药。中国人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队在诗歌《剥画皮》中，剥下了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派“老革命”的画皮，揭露了他假革命、反革命的真面目。为了批驳和控诉党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派所鼓吹的“剥削有功”的反动谬论，海淀区农民在《痛斥“剥削有功”论》中，通过一个老贫农在一年腊月三十晚上，在地主的逼租逼债下走投无路、家破人亡的悲惨情景，对中国赫鲁晓夫为地主资本家效劳的滔天罪行，提出了血泪的控诉。观众看完了这个节目，禁不住捏紧拳头高呼：“打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派！”工农兵和红卫兵革命小将演出的这些节目，短小精悍，尖锐泼辣，充满着强烈的革命性、战斗性，它们象匕首，象投枪，象爆破筒，象手榴弹，纷纷向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派投掷过去，大大地鼓舞了工农兵革命群众投入到当前的革命大批判中去的热情。许多公社社员看完了他们的演出，当场就召开声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的大会。许多工人看完了节目，遏制不住心头的怒火，跳上台去，以亲身的经历诉说劳动人民在旧社会遭受反动阶级剥削压迫的血泪史。他们说：“毛主席领着咱们走社会主义红道，中国赫鲁晓夫却要领着咱们走资本主义黑道，他真是狼子野心！咱们工人阶级再不能吃二遍苦了！一定要彻底批倒斗臭这条毒蛇！誓死保卫社会主义铁打的江山！”“以前咱们只知道‘掰杈’，不知道刨根，现在咱们才知道原来是这条毒根在作祟！刨树要刨根，咱们要挥起锄头，把这棵复辟资本主义的毒树连根刨出来！使它永远不能在咱们的社会主义土壤上生长！”
    在划时代的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，毛主席明确提出：党的文艺工作是“整个革命事业的一部分”、“是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。”但是，文艺界的一小撮修正主义分子却反其道而行之。他们以“间接配合”作为幌子，拒绝文艺为无产阶级政治服务，实际上是要为他们复辟资本主义服务。他们污蔑紧密配合政治任务的节目是什么“传声筒”，“赶热闹”，挥舞棍棒，拚命扼杀。这次工农兵和革命小将针锋相对地大造这伙反革命修正主义分子的反。他们遵照毛主席的教导，紧密地及时地配合着当前的无产阶级文化大革命的政治任务，在火线上编写和演出节目。他们说：“我们的每一个节目，都是一张活的大字报，只不过是利用艺术形式把它贴在舞台上罢了。”这样就使这次工农兵的业余演出真正成了无产阶级文化大革命的一个战场。毛主席每发出一个伟大号召，无产阶级文化大革命中每出现一个新的事物，在他们的节目中马上就得到了反映。当中央人民广播电台播送重要文章、重要消息的时候，有多少个正在乡下演出的毛泽东思想宣传队的队员，深夜坐在半导体收音机旁，一字一句地记录下来，马上组织学习讨论，彻夜不眠地赶写节目。他们怕影响社员睡觉，就跑到公路上、山坡上去排练，第二天一早，就给广大的贫下中农演出。他们说：“能让工农兵观众早一个小时、早一分钟听到毛主席他老人家的最新指示，这就是我们最大的幸福和愉快！”《革命派联合起来，进行夺权》，《抓革命，促生产》，《解放军来到咱们村》，《正确对待革命干部亮相》，《欢呼北京市革命委员会成立》等等节目，都非常及时地配合了当前文化大革命的政治任务，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，真正使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子，你们不是咒骂这是“应时性”，“传声筒”吗？你们听着：工农兵文艺就是要“应”革命之时，传毛泽东思想之声！
    二
    夺取了文艺舞台的工农兵和红卫兵革命小将，怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜的阶级感情，以最嘹亮的歌声，最热烈的舞蹈，歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳，歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利。每个晚会，每次演出，都闪烁着伟大的毛泽东思想光辉。演出时，台上台下、演员观众的思想感情溶成一片，时时爆发出热烈的欢呼：“毛主席万岁，毛主席万万岁！”北京卫戍部队毛泽东思想宣传队的战士们，把造型艺术、歌舞、独唱、对白交错一起，演出了“老三篇”，使广大观众在艺术领域中，重新学习了一遍“老三篇”。中国音乐学院的革命小将，用歌舞把毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》成功地表演出来了，获得了观众的热烈欢迎。小歌剧《红卫兵见到了毛主席》，热情洋溢地表达了红卫兵革命小将在天安门见到了毛主席的欢乐心情。舞剧《亚非拉人民热爱毛主席》则通过处在反美斗争前哨的亚非拉人民按照毛主席的教导进行的浴血斗争，表达了他们对毛主席的无比信仰和无比热爱。工农兵和红卫兵革命小将们满怀豪情壮志说：“我们每敲一锤锣，每擂一下鼓，每唱一支歌，每跳一个舞，都要跟宣传毛泽东思想紧密联系起来，让天是毛泽东思想的天，地是毛泽东思想的地，人是毛泽东思想武装起来的人！”
    毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”歌颂哪一个阶级，塑造哪一个阶级的英雄人物，哪一个阶级的人物在文艺作品中、在艺术舞台上居于统治地位，这是文艺战线上无产阶级同资产阶级之间阶级斗争的焦点。解放十七年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派伙同文艺界的反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵、夏衍等人，极力排斥工农兵，打击工农兵，不让作品表现工农兵英雄形象，不让工农兵的人物形象登上文艺舞台。他们爱的是洋人、古人、死人，是资产阶级和封建主义的僵尸腐肉。为了点缀门面，即使有些作品也描写了工农兵，但大多是丑化了的形象。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”首都工农兵在毛泽东文艺思想的光辉照耀下，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，阔步登上了艺术舞台，把被颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来了。他们为革命尽情歌唱，为革命纵情舞蹈，为工农兵纵情表演。来自生产和战斗第一线的广大工农兵，真正成了文化艺术的主人。他们满怀豪情壮志说：“革命先烈用生命和鲜血换来的革命舞台，我们今天站定了，永远站定了！”在他们的演出中，满台都是抡起铁锤的工人，拿着锄头的农民，紧握钢枪的战士，都是顶天立地，无限热爱毛主席，热爱共产党，热爱社会主义的无产阶级革命派。工厂的工人看了他们的演出后，激动地说：“咱们从舞台上看到了自己。”广大的贫下中农也说：“你们造反造得好哇，造出了个新舞台！以前满台上是皇帝太后，穆桂英，佘太君，现在满台都是咱贫下中农！毛主席他老人家把咱们捧得多高，看得多重啦！”
    三
    文艺为工农兵服务，这是一个根本的方向问题。长期以来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以及文艺界的修正主义分子周扬、林默涵、夏衍等人，一方面大砍老八路的“文工团”，把文艺工作者推进“象牙之塔”，推进专门化的大剧场，使他们与工农兵隔绝，与火热的斗争生活隔离，逐渐成为“精神贵族”；另一方面极力打击工农兵群众文艺，打击工农兵组织起来的业余团体，把文艺引向只为少数人服务而不为广大工农兵服务的泥潭。这次工农兵和红卫兵革命小将，大造了修正主义文艺黑线的反。他们举起红旗，扛着毛主席画像，背起背包，顶着骄阳，冒着风雨，走向街头、工厂、部队，走向田间地头、偏僻山村，活跃在斗争的第一线。他们的舞台扎在最广大的工农兵之中。他们手不离毛主席的书，嘴不离毛主席的话，心不离毛主席的思想，行动不离毛主席的教导。他们时时处处宣传毛泽东思想，让伟大的毛泽东思想在广大群众中扎下了深深的根子，转化为巨大的物质力量。北京卫戍部队毛泽东思想宣传队，积极响应毛主席支左、支工、支农的伟大号召，踏遍了整个密云山区。人多的时候演，人少的时候也演。有一次他们正在山坳穿行，突然看到山顶上有四个社员在劳动，于是他们不辞劳苦，爬上山顶，进行专场演出。大兴县由一些基干民兵组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，他们听说有几个贫农老大娘腿脚不灵便，特地跑到她们家院门前拉开场子演出。由首都大专院校红卫兵革命小将组成的数十支毛泽东思想宣传队，整天沿着田埂走，看到哪里有劳动的社员，就奔到哪里去演出。一天，有一个小女孩看了他们的演出后说：“叔叔，你们演得好哇，要是我爷爷能看上那有多好呵！”小将们当即问明原因，原来她爷爷由于给地主扛了三十多年活，眼睛不好，很少看过演出。于是，一股强烈的阶级感情涌上小将们心头，第二天就来到了这位老大爷家演出，观众就只有一家三口人。这位老大爷看了他们的演出后，激动得热泪直流，紧紧攥住革命小将的手说：“你们是真正为咱贫下中农演出的，把毛泽东思想送到炕头上来了。我一定要听一辈子毛主席他老人家的话，坚决打倒那个中国的赫鲁晓夫！”由钳工、车工、汽车司机组成的首都职工毛泽东思想战旗演出队，他们深入到许多工厂的车间、工段、伙房以及市郊的许多农村进行演出。有的老工人看到他们那充满生活气息和革命豪情的节目后，流着眼泪说：“你们为毛主席争了气，为咱们工人阶级争了气！从你们身上，咱们看到了社会主义文艺的新面貌！”
    参加这次宣传演出的工农兵文艺大军，他们许多人本身就是工农兵中的一分子。他们来自工农兵，来自无产阶级文化大革命的前哨。他们最了解工农兵的斗争，最了解工农兵的需要。他们编写的节目，也是来自火辣辣的阶级斗争生活，充满了强烈的革命战斗气息。在艺术形式上，短小精悍，鲜明生动，尖锐泼辣，为工农兵大众所喜闻乐见。在演出活动中，他们读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，处处以毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》作为行动的指南，他们生活在群众之中，同群众一道劳动，一道战斗，思想革命化，作风雷厉风行，所以，他们为工农兵服务得很好，工农兵热烈欢迎他们的演出。
    这些小分队深入基层，巡回演出，象一部红色的播种机，到处撒下了革命文艺的种子。许多工厂、人民公社、部队、学校，都建立了自己的文艺小分队，利用业余时间进行创作演出，使工农兵文艺更带广泛性、群众性，更加蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来了。
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。首都的工农兵、红卫兵以极其饱满的政治热情和高昂的革命姿态，昂首阔步，挥笔上阵，登上了文艺舞台，成了文艺的主力军。他们大写新诗，大演新戏，大唱新歌，大画新画，大造特造帝王将相、才子佳人、古人死人洋人的反。工农兵文艺具有最广泛的群众性，最坚定的革命性，最强大的战斗力。它以强烈的革命内容和崭新的艺术形式，为我国的社会主义文艺开创了一个新的天地，划出了一个新的时代。
    山花烂漫满园春，让那些修正主义、资产阶级“权威”在这烂漫的“山花”面前哀叫哭泣吧！工农兵文艺一定会在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，大结硕果，大放异彩！
