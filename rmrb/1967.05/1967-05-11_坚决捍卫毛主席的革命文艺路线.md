Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism's worldview and literary and artistic theory. It is the first complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist literary and artistic line in the history of the international communist movement. Twenty-five years of revolutionary practice have increasingly proven its boundless vitality.

The appearance of this epoch-making, brilliant document, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," heralded the beginning of a new era in the proletarian revolutionary literary and artistic movement. It is like a lighthouse, illuminating our victorious path forward; it is like a morning star, heralding the emergence of proletarian literature and art with a new face to the world; it is like a verdict, declaring the imminent end of all reactionary, decadent capitalist and feudal literature and art. Whether to loyally execute and bravely defend Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line is the focal point of our struggle against all counter-revolutionary revisionists. Over the past decade, the struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic circles has been a struggle over whether to execute or oppose "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

From the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng clique to the counter-revolutionary revisionist gang led by Zhou Yang, and to the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party who are the backers of the literary and artistic black line, they have all directed their attacks at the boundless flame of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They have used every vile language to curse it, employed every despicable trick to distort it, and raised various banners to oppose it. The enemy's fervent opposition only proves the immense greatness of the "Talks."

Chairman Mao said, "The question of for whom is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Throughout history, the literature and art of the exploiting classes have always been controlled and utilized by a few ruling classes, becoming tools for reactionary rulers to oppress and deceive the people. Chairman Mao most vividly proposed that "our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and utilized by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." It was Chairman Mao who first correctly and systematically proposed and solved the problem of how literature and art can truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers means using the most advanced and living Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—to arm the workers, peasants, and soldiers through various artistic forms, pushing forward the socialist revolution of eliminating capitalism and establishing socialism to victory. The highest mission of literature and art is to propagate Mao Zedong Thought.

To better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian politics, Chairman Mao proposed a series of correct and fundamental measures in the "Talks." First is the thorough transformation of the worldview of literary and artistic workers, shifting their standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the side of the proletariat. They must long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to transform themselves, familiarize themselves with the objects they describe, and truly become one of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, becoming their faithful spokespeople. If one's worldview is not transformed, how can one understand the workers, peasants, and soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought? If one's standpoint does not change, how can one sing the praises of the workers, peasants, and soldiers? If one does not become a member of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, how can one be familiar with and use the language of the workers, peasants, and soldiers to create literary and artistic works that serve them? It is hard to imagine that those "artists" who are intoxicated with "fame, foreign influence, and antiquity" can understand the spirit of the people of Dazhai in changing heaven and earth, or derive any "inspiration" from the self-reliant, hardworking, and selfless labor of the people of Daqing in starting with the "Two Articles." Lei Feng wearing torn socks and sending years of savings to a commune affected by disasters is seen as doing "foolish things" by those standing on the bourgeois standpoint. Wang Jie sacrificing his life to protect his comrades in the face of an exploding landmine is seen as "incomprehensible" by the bourgeois masters. Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and shifting our standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the side of the proletariat, can we create truly proletarian literature and art that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Over the past decade, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionists led by Zhou Yang, with his support, have directed their attacks at the fundamental issue of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the "Talks." They openly distorted Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, proposing the reactionary program of "literature and art for all the people," making literature and art serve the landlords and bourgeoisie, and becoming a tool for the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao taught us, "Revolutionary writers and artists in China, those with a future, must go to the people, must long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers..." This is the prerequisite and key to producing literature and art that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The counter-revolutionary revisionists led by Zhou Yang fiercely resisted this directive from Chairman Mao. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party also absurdly claimed that "artists can go to the countryside in cars, eat and sleep in the car." This is a wanton attack on Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. How can one long-term, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly go among the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers while sitting in a car? How can one shift one's standpoint to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to the side of the proletariat, while eating and sleeping in the car? Obviously, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party advocates "going to the countryside in cars" with the purpose of opposing the integration of artists with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is completely consistent with their evil purpose of advocating "three names" and "three high policies." They promote material incentives and put fame and profit first, precisely to lure artists to increasingly distance themselves from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, fall into the mire of revisionism, and turn literature and art into a tool for the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao said, "Anything that truly benefits the people is a good thing." We believe that works that propagate Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to educate the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and make the people deeply understand the importance of consolidating the proletarian dictatorship, accelerate the class struggle of eliminating capitalism and establishing socialism, and promote the victory of the socialist revolution are the kind of works that truly benefit the people and are good things. It is hard to imagine that works like China's "The Peony Pavilion" and foreign works like "La Traviata" can arouse the people's enthusiasm for building socialism! However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party not only avoids mentioning the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought but also openly proposes that "if it cannot reflect modern life, then perform historical plays, let everyone watch the play, rest well, and this is to encourage socialist labor enthusiasm." He even says, "If it is harmful, changing some parts slightly can also be performed." It is under the support and protection of this Chinese Khrushchev that, for a long time, emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties have ruled our stage, and a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds have freely spread. They use the names of "appreciation" and "entertainment" to force-feed the workers, peasants, and soldiers with the private goods of feudalism and capitalism, poisoning the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party advocates the revisionist fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious," "three harmonies and one less," "three autonomies and one contract," and in literature and art, he must use the mouths of ghosts and snakes to create public opinion for his counter-revolutionary restoration. He says, "historical plays can be performed," "if it is harmful, changing some parts slightly can also be performed," so what cannot be performed? Even the blatantly treacherous film "The Last Emperor" is seen as "patriotic" in his eyes, and other things in his mind should be even more "fragrant flowers." Of course, there are also things they think should not be performed, which are literary and artistic works that truly propagate Mao Zedong Thought and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and proletarian politics. He once personally intervened to make countless difficulties for the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Port," and he instructed his henchmen to brutally persecute the revolutionary leftists who loyally executed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, represented by Comrade Jiang Qing, and fiercely denigrate the great significance of the revolutionary model works led by Comrade Jiang Qing. They know that Comrade Jiang Qing's leadership of the revolutionary leftists in the literary and artistic circles has broken through the most stubborn stronghold of Beijing opera and will drive the revolution of the entire literary and artistic circles, making their days miserable. They are enraged and fiercely counterattack, attempting to reverse the inevitable doom of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist literature and art.

Chairman Mao taught us, "Only by representing the people can one educate the people, only by being a student of the people can one be a teacher of the people." Chairman Mao called on literary and artistic workers to earnestly learn from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, transforming their thoughts and emotions. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his henchmen oppose learning Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, oppose learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and maliciously reduce the learning problem of literary and artistic workers to a problem of learning techniques. They elevate bourgeois "experts" and "authorities" to the heavens, wanting revolutionary literary and artistic workers to bow and obey before bourgeois "authorities," with the purpose of "training" a literary and artistic team that serves counter-revolutionary restoration. We must see through the evil intentions of this number one careerist within the Party and never let his conspiracy succeed, never allowing him to use bourgeois ideology to transform our revolutionary literary and artistic team.

In the "Talks," Chairman Mao taught us, "The life of the people... is the inexhaustible and boundless source of all literature and art. ...There cannot be a second source." This is an absolute truth. The "ancestors" of the 1930s, at that time, completely detached from the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, locked themselves in small rooms, clinging to "fame, foreign influence, and antiquity," and peddled some private goods about "female workers" and capitalist "young masters" falling in love. Today, they have become "old men," and they can only copy some trivial things from foreign books and pick up some wisdom from their feudal ancestors to deceive and poison people. What they can write is only poisonous weeds like "Northern Jiangnan" that slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Only by going to the only broadest and richest source can one enter the creative process. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party advocates that "films from all countries should be brought in a little," "revisionist things should not be afraid." He loves revisionist things so much that he naturally would not be afraid of them, and this is precisely the thing that resonates with his heart. He shouts at the top of his lungs that "we all want," "bring in a little of everything," with the evil purpose of attempting to distort Chairman Mao's teachings on "source" and "flow," making us follow the foreigners and the dead, step by step, fall into the mire of revisionism, and lead revolutionary literary and artistic workers to the dead end of revisionism, capitalism, and the so-called literature and art of the 1930s, achieving his counter-revolutionary purpose of distorting Chairman Mao's literary and artistic direction.

As early as twenty-five years ago, the great leader Chairman Mao clearly pointed out the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his henchmen have thoroughly and maliciously attacked and distorted the essence of the "Talks." Over the past decade, the literary and artistic black line of revisionism, with the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party as the backer, has seized power in our literary and artistic circles and fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line.

Over the past decade, the struggle between the two lines in the literary and artistic circles has been a struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and the revisionist literary and artistic black line, a struggle between executing the "Talks" and opposing the "Talks." Executing the "Talks" is for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship; opposing the "Talks" is for opening the door wide for the restoration of capitalism. Executing and opposing the "Talks" is one of the focal points of the struggle between the two classes and the two roads.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has been exposed, and his ugly face has been revealed to the world. The mastermind behind the attacks and distortions of the "Talks," the backer of the revisionist literary and artistic black line, is him! Exposing him is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and a great joy for the people of the entire country. On the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the publication of the "Talks," we cheer for exposing this mastermind behind the attacks and distortions of the "Talks."

Chairman Mao taught us, "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very fierce."

Overthrowing the revisionist literary and artistic black line, new black lines will inevitably emerge. Experience tells us that in the struggle between the two roads on the literary and artistic front, the enemy always directs their attacks at the "Talks." Whether to execute the "Talks" or oppose the "Talks" is the main sign that distinguishes the two roads and the two lines on the literary and artistic front. Whatever conforms to the spirit of the "Talks," we will resolutely execute and implement; whatever violates the spirit of the "Talks," we will resolutely resist, oppose, and struggle against. We must take the "Talks" as our motto, strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions in the "Talks," resolutely defend and loyally execute Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, marching forward to victory!

    坚决捍卫毛主席的革命文艺路线
    金敬迈
    一
    毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，是国际共产主义运动历史上第一次提出的最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线。二十五年的革命实践，越来越证明它有无限强大的生命力。
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这部划时代的光辉文献的出现，宣告无产阶级革命文艺运动新纪元的开始。它象一座灯塔，照亮了我们前进的胜利道路；它象一颗启明星，预告着无产阶级文艺将以崭新的面貌出现于世界；它象一份判决书，宣判一切反动的、腐朽的资本主义文艺和封建主义文艺末日已近。是否忠实执行、勇敢捍卫毛主席的文艺路线，是我们无产阶级文艺战士同一切反革命修正主义分子斗争的焦点。建国十几年来，文艺界两条路线的斗争，就是执行还是反对《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的斗争。
    从胡风反革命集团，到反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙，以及文艺黑线的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，都把进攻的矛头对准了光焰无际的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》。他们用尽了一切恶毒的语言来咒骂它，使尽了一切卑鄙的伎俩来篡改它，打着各式各样的旗号来反对它。敌人这样起劲地反对，只能说明《讲话》的无比伟大。
    二
    毛主席说：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”有史以来，剥削阶级的文学艺术，都是为少数统治者所掌握、所利用，成为反动统治者压迫人民、欺骗人民的工具。毛主席最鲜明地提出了：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”是毛主席第一次最正确、最系统地提出并解决文艺如何才能真正为工农兵服务这个问题的。
    文艺为工农兵服务，就是用当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，通过各种文艺形式去武装工农兵，把灭资兴无、破私立公的社会主义革命推向胜利。文艺的最高使命就是宣传毛泽东思想。
    为使文艺更好地为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，毛主席在《讲话》中，向我们提出了一系列最正确、最根本的措施。首先是文艺工作者世界观的彻底改造问题，把立足点移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来，长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，改造自己，熟悉自己描写的对象，使自己真正成为工农兵的一员，成为工农兵的忠实代言人。世界观不改造，怎么能理解用毛泽东思想武装起来的工农兵呢？立场不改变，怎么能歌颂工农兵呢？不使自己成为工农兵群众中的一员，又怎么能够熟悉并运用工农兵的语言写出为工农兵服务的文艺作品来呢？很难想象，那些沉醉于“名、洋、古”的“文艺家”们，能够理解大寨人改天换地的精神风貌，能够从大庆人“两论”起家，自力更生，奋发图强的忘我劳动中得到什么创作“灵感”。雷锋穿着破袜子，把几年积攒的钱寄给受灾的公社，站在资产阶级立场上的人，会认为这是办“傻事”。王杰在地雷爆炸时，用自己的生命保护了同志，在资产阶级老爷们看来更是“不可理解”的。只有遵照毛主席的教导，把立足点移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来，我们才能创作出真正为工农兵的文艺，真正的无产阶级的文艺。
    十几年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，及其支持下的反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙，正是把进攻的矛头指向《讲话》中文艺为工农兵服务这一根本问题。他们公然篡改毛主席文艺为工农兵服务的方向，提出“全民文艺”的反动纲领，使文艺为地主、资产阶级服务，成为复辟资本主义的工具。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去……”这是产生为工农兵服务的文艺的前提和关键。反革命修正主义分子周扬等人竭力对抗毛主席这一指示。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，也胡说什么“文艺工作者可以坐着汽车下乡，吃饭、睡觉都可以在汽车上。”这是对毛主席文艺路线的猖狂进攻。试问：坐在汽车上怎么能够长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去？试问：吃饭睡觉都在汽车上，怎么能把立足点移到工农兵方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来？显然，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派主张“坐汽车下乡”，目的在于反对文艺工作者和工农兵的结合，这和他们所提倡的“三名主义”、“三高政策”的罪恶目的是完全一致的。他们大搞物质刺激，名利挂帅，就是为了引诱文艺工作者越来越脱离工农兵群众，坠入修正主义的泥坑，使文艺变成为资本主义复辟服务的工具。
    毛主席说：“任何一种东西，必须使人民群众得到真实的利益，才是好的东西。”我们认为，宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想来教育工农兵，让人民群众深刻地懂得巩固无产阶级政权的重要性，加速进行灭资兴无的阶级斗争，以推动社会主义革命胜利前进，这样的作品才能使人民群众得到真实的利益，才是好的东西。很难想象，中国的《桃花扇》、外国的《茶花女》之类的玩意儿，能够唤起人民建设社会主义的热情！而党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，不仅绝口不谈宣传毛泽东思想，而且公然提出：“不能表现现代生活的，就演历史戏，让大家看了戏，好好休息，就是鼓励社会主义劳动热情。”甚至说：“有害的，有些地方稍改一些，也可以演。”正是在这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的支持和包庇下，长期以来，帝王将相、才子佳人统治着我们的舞台，大批反党反社会主义的毒草自由泛滥。他们假借“欣赏”、“娱乐”为名，把宣扬封建主义、资本主义的私货硬塞给工农兵，毒害工农兵。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，鼓吹“剥削有功”、“三和一少”、“三自一包”等修正主义谬论，在文艺上必然要借牛鬼蛇神之口来为他的反革命复辟制造舆论。他说，“历史的可以演”，“有害的有些地方稍改一些也可以演”，那么还有什么不可以演的呢？连赤裸裸的卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》，在他看来尚且是“爱国主义”的，其它的，在他心目中，就更应该是“香花”了。当然，也有他们认为不可以演的，这就是宣传毛泽东思想，真正为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务的文艺作品。他曾亲自出面，对革命现代京剧《海港》百般刁难；他指使他的爪牙对以江青同志为代表的、忠实执行毛主席文艺路线的革命左派，进行了疯狂的迫害，极力贬低江青同志亲自领导创作的革命样板作品的伟大意义。他们也知道，江青同志领导文艺界的革命左派，突破了京剧这个最顽固的堡垒，必将带动整个文艺界的革命，使他们的日子混不下去了。他们暴跳如雷，疯狂反扑，妄图挽回封建主义、资本主义、修正主义文艺的必然灭亡的命运。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。”毛主席号召文艺工作者踏踏实实地向工农兵群众学习，使自己的思想感情来一个变化，来一番改造。而党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他的爪牙们，反对学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，反对向工农兵学习，别有用心地把文艺工作者的学习问题，归结为一个学习技巧问题。他们把资产阶级“专家”、“权威”捧上了天，要革命的文艺工作者在资产阶级“权威”面前俯首听命，目的就是要“造就”出一支为反革命复辟服务的文艺队伍。我们一定要识破这个党内头号野心家的罪恶目的，绝不让他的阴谋得逞，绝不允许他用资产阶级思想来改造我们革命的文艺队伍。
    毛主席在《讲话》中教导我们：“人民生活……是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。……此外不能有第二个源泉。”这是千真万确的真理。三十年代的“祖师爷”们，当年，他们完全脱离工农兵群众的生活，关在亭子间里，死抱着“名、洋、古”不放，胡诌一些“女工”和资本家“少爷”谈情说爱的私货来贩卖。今天，他们成了“老头子”了，仍然只能从洋书上抄点鸡零狗碎，从他们封建主义的老祖宗那里拾点牙慧来唬人，来毒害人。他们能写出来的，只能是象《北国江南》那样污蔑工农兵的毒草。
    只有到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，然后才有可能进入创作过程。而党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派却鼓吹什么：“世界各国的电影都搞点进来”，“改良主义的东西，不要怕”。改良主义的东西，他爱都还爱不及呢，当然更不会怕了，这正是和他心心相印的东西。他之所以声嘶力竭地叫喊“我们都要”，“都搞点进来”，其罪恶目的就是妄图篡改毛主席的关于“源”与“流”的教导，使我们跟在洋人、死人的后边，亦步亦趋，走进修正主义的泥坑，把革命的文艺工作者引到修正主义、资本主义和所谓三十年代文艺相结合的绝路上去，以达到他篡改毛主席文艺方向的反革命目的。
    三
    早在二十五年前，伟大的领袖毛主席就给我们明确地指出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派及其爪牙，却全面地恶毒地攻击和篡改了《讲话》的精髓。十几年来，以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为后台老板的修正主义文艺黑线专了我们文艺界的政，疯狂地与毛主席的文艺路线相对抗。
    十多年来，文艺界两条路线的斗争，就是毛主席的革命文艺路线与修正主义文艺黑线的斗争，就是执行《讲话》和反对《讲话》的斗争。执行《讲话》，为的是巩固无产阶级专政；反对《讲话》，是为资本主义复辟大开方便之门。执行和反对《讲话》，是两个阶级、两条道路斗争的焦点之一。
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派被揪了出来，他的丑恶面目暴露于光天化日之下。攻击、篡改《讲话》的罪魁祸首，修正主义文艺黑线的总后台，就是他！把他揪了出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是全国人民的大喜事。在纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年的今天，我们为揪出了这个攻击和篡改《讲话》的罪魁祸首而欢呼。
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    反掉了修正主义文艺黑线，将来还会产生新的黑线。经验告诉我们，在文艺战线上两条道路的斗争中，敌人总是把矛头集中对准《讲话》。执行《讲话》还是反对《讲话》，这是区别文艺战线上两条道路、两条路线的主要标志。凡是符合《讲话》精神的，我们就坚决执行，坚决照办；凡是违背《讲话》精神的，我们就坚决抵制，坚决反对，坚决斗争。我们一定要把《讲话》当作座右铭，不折不扣地遵照毛主席在《讲话》中的指示去做，坚决捍卫、忠实执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，永远高举毛泽东文艺思想伟大红旗，胜利前进！
