The entire nation's military and civilians enthusiastically acclaim: Chairman Mao's sharing of "May Day" with the capital's people is the greatest encouragement and support for hundreds of millions of people.

Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in our hearts.

Revolutionary masses across the country have expressed: We will not let down Chairman Mao's care and expectations. We must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and ensure that the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units are carried out well. We will seize the revolution and promote production to achieve dual victories in revolution and production.

The entire army's broad ranks of soldiers and officers have expressed: We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go deep into the masses, and do an even better job in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. We will help the revolutionary masses seize power, hold power, and use power well, further strengthen military-civilian unity, and achieve new successes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on May 1st, twice came among the masses and celebrated "May Day" International Labor Day with the broad revolutionary masses and international friends from five continents. This greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the capital. Workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards joyfully spread the news, enthusiastically acclaiming that our great leader Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most cares for the masses, and most supports the masses' revolutionary movement, forever united with the revolutionary masses.

Revolutionary fighters of the capital's proletariat enthusiastically said, last year Chairman Mao repeatedly received the revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary masses, giving great encouragement and strength to the revolutionary people of the entire country, promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve great victories! Now, at the moment when the revolutionary people of the entire country are launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our great leader Chairman Mao has come among us again. This has given us a hundredfold courage and boundless strength. We are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Many revolutionary fighters, with tears of excitement, wrote in their diaries, big-character posters, at meetings, and in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, solemnly vowing: We will forever be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao, forever loyal to the great thought of Mao Zedong. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units well, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought fly over all of China and the world!

"We saw Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao shook hands with us! We are so happy, we feel full of revolutionary strength!" Comrades of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, after being received by Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, joyfully and excitedly spread the news. Some ran dozens of miles back to the factory to tell their comrades; some made dozens of phone calls to tell comrades who were on duty during the holiday. The good news spread like spring breeze throughout the city. Comrade Lu Jiacai, a young grinder from the First Machine Tool Factory and a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, said: When I shook hands with Chairman Mao, I wished him longevity and determined to forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

Comrade Deng Wantian, a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Agricultural Representatives Congress, excitedly said: Chairman Mao received us at Tiananmen, this is not only our honor but also the honor of all poor and lower-middle peasants in the city and the country. We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, seize the revolution, promote production, and build a new socialist countryside in the style of Dazhai.

The Red Guards and revolutionary students of the capital's colleges and universities have been surging with emotion and high spirits these days. They excitedly said: Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most cares for the masses, and most supports the masses' revolutionary movement and the Red Guard movement. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong thought. At present, we must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, form a vast revolutionary army, and resolutely overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We dare to "strike a handful" and also dare to "liberate a large area," thoroughly criticize the reactionary policy of "striking a large area and protecting a handful" in the personnel issue of the bourgeois reactionary line, advance the revolutionary "great alliance," realize the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The revolutionary young fighters of Peking Normal University's Jinggangshan Commune, at the Labor People's Cultural Palace, personally saw our great leader Chairman Mao. They were very excited and said: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You celebrated "May Day" with us, filling us with strength. We promise you: we will fight to defend your brilliant thought, and even die to defend your brilliant thought. The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our red hearts loyal to you will never change.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the Beijing Garrison and the troops stationed in Beijing, together with the broad revolutionary masses of the capital, are immersed in the boundless joy of the holiday. Many soldiers who saw Chairman Mao, with tears of excitement, repeatedly told their comrades about their happy scenes of seeing Chairman Mao. Comrade Kong Xiangxiu, a platoon leader from a certain unit who was selected as a member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, shook hands with Chairman Mao twice yesterday. The entire platoon of soldiers, upon hearing the good news, jumped and shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Comrade Liu Daluan, a deputy squad leader, said: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Recently, you issued the great call to support the army and love the people, and we will definitely carry it out. We must do a good job in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. Humbly learn from the local proletarian revolutionary cadres, unite with them, and fight together. Many soldiers returned to the barracks and wrote reflections, poems, and diaries overnight, expressing their boundless love for our great leader Chairman Mao, wishing our great leader Chairman Mao longevity!

Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: The news of our heart's reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day with three million revolutionary masses of the capital and international friends from five continents, greatly encouraged the revolutionary masses across the country. Billions of hearts flew to Beijing, flew to Chairman Mao. The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses across the country excitedly said: Comrade Lin Biao's "May Day" inscription, "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!" most concentratedly expressed the voice of the revolutionary people of the entire country and the world. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

After hearing the news of Chairman Mao celebrating "May Day" with three million revolutionary masses of the capital, the broad ranks of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary young fighters, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres across the country were filled with enthusiasm, spreading the news, holding meetings and parades, beating drums and gongs, posting joyous bulletins, singing and dancing, using different languages to enthusiastically acclaim: "Wish Chairman Mao longevity!" "Wish Comrade Lin Biao good health!" The songs "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" echoed through the sky. The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses excitedly said: Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most cares for the masses, and most supports the masses' revolutionary movement, forever united with the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao! You are always among the masses, and we are always by your side. You celebrating "May Day" with the revolutionary masses of the capital is the greatest encouragement and support for hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country.

The news spread to Shanghai, and the banks of the Huangpu River echoed with cheers. The broad ranks of proletarian revolutionary cadres and Red Guards in Shanghai, who had experienced the "January Revolution" storm, joyfully cheered and were immersed in boundless happiness. They said, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will not let you down. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism, and make our socialist iron fortress unshakable!

Revolutionary young fighters across the country, upon hearing the news, couldn't help but recall the happy scenes of being inspected by Chairman Mao in Beijing last year. Many revolutionary young fighters participating in the Red Guard Representatives Congress of colleges and universities in Shandong Province, as well as many revolutionary young fighters in Guiyang City, with tears of happiness, shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!" "Wish Chairman Mao longevity!" They excitedly said, at the decisive moment when the people of the entire country are launching a general offensive against the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, Chairman Mao again inspects the cultural revolutionary army of the capital on "May Day," this is a great encouragement and support for the broad revolutionary masses across the country who are criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The responsible comrade of the Taiyuan Municipal Revolutionary Committee said at the mass rally of various revolutionary cadres: Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day with the revolutionary masses of the capital, receiving the comrades of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee delegation on Tiananmen Gate, is the greatest honor and happiness for the people of the entire province. We must not let down Chairman Mao's expectations and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The heroic poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai excitedly said, Chairman Mao receiving Comrade Chen Yonggui is receiving all the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai. We will definitely respond to Chairman Mao's great call with practical actions, seize the revolution, promote production, and achieve a double harvest in revolution and production.

The revolutionary workers of the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory joyfully said: Chairman Mao most cares for us, most trusts us, and most supports us. It is he who supports us red rebels. It is he who leads us red rebels to seize power. Whether in the days of war or in the complex class struggle of the socialist revolutionary period, he is always fighting with us broad revolutionary masses, winning with us, and every moment is united with us revolutionary masses. He is the eternal red sun in our hearts. Comrade Chen Changfeng, a veteran of the Long March who followed Chairman Mao, a division commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, said: I deeply feel from revolutionary practice that Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most loves the masses, forever breathes with the masses and shares their fate. In the past, he led the Red Army soldiers to the homes of the poor people, talked with the masses, conducted investigations, and explained revolutionary principles to them, supporting the peasants' revolutionary movement; now, he again and again receives the revolutionary masses, fully supporting the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses. Chairman Mao is forever united with the masses, and we revolutionary people will forever follow Chairman Mao to make revolution.

The hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres across the country unanimously expressed: At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day with the proletarian revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the capital, is not only the happiness and honor of the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the capital but also the happiness and honor of the revolutionary people of the entire country and the world, bringing us great encouragement and boundless fighting strength. We will not let down Chairman Mao's care and expectations. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism, combine the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, thoroughly eliminate their poison and influence in various fields. In the great criticism, further promote and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. At the same time, with a thousandfold effort, implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," seize the revolution, promote production, use revolution to command production, use revolution to drive production, and further strive for dual victories in revolution and production.

Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: The news of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day with the revolutionary masses of the capital brought great encouragement and new fighting strength to the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces.

From the East China Sea front to the Ili Valley, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the shores of the South China Sea, every camp, airport, and port is filled with joy. Soldiers and officers, accompanied by the cheers broadcast on the radio, shouted a thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live!" Wishing Chairman Mao longevity! Longevity! Wishing Comrade Lin Biao good health! Forever healthy! Many soldiers, with tears of happiness, wrote poems and articles praising the reddest red sun in their hearts, Chairman Mao, forever united with the revolutionary masses. Old Red Army soldiers who followed Chairman Mao in his southern and northern campaigns were surging with emotion, telling the young soldiers about their battle experiences of victory after victory along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Tens of thousands of new soldiers thought of their growth process under the sun and rain of Mao Zedong thought, singing "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman, All Things Grow with the Sun" with emotion.

The broad ranks of soldiers and officers who are vigilantly guarding the coastal and border defense lines, upon hearing the news of Chairman Mao celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day with the revolutionary masses of the capital, are even more spirited. Soldiers who won three victories in eight days, shooting down five American aggressor planes, said in a discussion, Chairman Mao, it is you who gave us the greatest courage, wisdom, and strength. We will definitely use your brilliant thought to further arm our minds, be ready at any time to annihilate all daring enemies, and create new achievements in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Soldiers on the front lines facing Jinmen and Matsu, soldiers of the Guangzhou Army guarding the southern gate of the motherland, and soldiers of a certain unit of the Kunming Army stationed on the southwestern border, at the moment of celebrating Chairman Mao's celebration of "May Day" International Labor Day with the revolutionary masses of the capital, wrote letters of determination, expressing their willingness to contribute all their strength to defend the motherland, defend the proletarian dictatorship, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training are overjoyed these days, eagerly spreading the news of Chairman Mao celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day with the revolutionary masses of the capital. They firmly expressed that they would unite with the proletarian revolutionary cadres, fight together, and win together, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Soldiers and officers of the armies stationed in Shanghai, Shanxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and other places held meetings and discussions, saying, our great leader Chairman Mao most trusts the masses, most cares for the masses, and most supports the masses' revolutionary movement, forever united with the revolutionary masses, setting a brilliant example for us. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, go deep into the masses, fight shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses, complete the great historical task of struggle, criticism, and transformation, and achieve new successes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many units of the Beijing, Shenyang, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Navy and Air Force armies further summarized the experiences and lessons of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, do an even better job in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, help the proletarian revolutionary cadres seize power, hold power, and use power well, and deepen the deep friendship between the military and the people in the struggle.

Today, many units sent Mao Zedong thought propaganda teams to factories and villages, singing and dancing to spread the news, propagandizing to the broad revolutionary masses the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, propagandizing Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of "the proletariat can only liberate all humanity to finally liberate itself," realizing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Most beloved leader Chairman Mao, your great thought shines brightly, and your flames are endless. The hearts of billions of revolutionary people are with you, resolutely following your instructions: care about state affairs, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
