From April 24 to 26, the Soviet revisionist leadership, along with a small group of their European followers, held a counterrevolutionary black meeting in Karlovy Vary, Czechoslovakia.

Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk had been busy for an entire year preparing for this meeting. They had hoped to hold a lively four-day event to boost the morale of modern revisionists and make some noise. However, after just two and a half days, the meeting could not continue. Brezhnev grabbed his briefcase and left, and the meeting ended hastily.

This was a meeting that marked the great bankruptcy of the new European revisionists.

To convene this meeting, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk had to work tirelessly, using both soft and hard tactics. However, the attendees were still scattered and disorganized. Some parties refused to follow the Soviet revisionists' directives and declined to attend the meeting. As for the Tito clique, they did not attend to maintain their special position as the old henchmen of U.S. imperialism.

This meeting was planned by the Soviet revisionists to further their anti-China agenda. At the meeting, Brezhnev took the lead in attacking China. Behind the scenes, they engaged in intense anti-China activities. However, few dared to openly attack China at the meeting. They even emphasized that the anti-China issue "was not on the agenda for this meeting." Why did this strange phenomenon occur? This was merely an attempt to increase the deceptiveness of the meeting and to evade the exposure and criticism from Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people. This shows that the Soviet revisionists encountered difficulties in openly raising the banner of united anti-China actions at such meetings. It exposed the pathetic state of the anti-China heroes: they wanted to attack China but couldn't.

This meeting was originally intended to prepare for a global gathering of traitors and scabs. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk had been shouting about holding a "new world communist conference," with some saying the conditions were "ripening," others saying the conditions were "rapidly ripening," and yet others saying the conditions were "ripe." They were all talking at once, creating a lot of noise. However, at the Karlovy Vary meeting, this shouting suddenly stopped. Did they no longer want to hold such a meeting that was anti-communist, anti-China, anti-people, anti-revolution, and anti-Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought? Of course not. It was just that on this issue, the scabs had unspoken grievances; they each had their own plans, with numerous contradictions and difficulties in unifying their positions.

Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk had hoped to use this meeting to restore the "authority" of the revisionist baton of the Khrushchev era. However, things turned out contrary to their wishes. The Soviet revisionist baton became even less effective, and the European revisionist groups each went their own way, with a growing tendency to act freely. Despite their efforts to conceal this, they had to admit, albeit reluctantly, that there were "differences" among them and that formulating a common policy was "not simple" and "not easy."

The Karlovy Vary meeting reflected the disunity and internal strife within the European modern revisionist camp. This was a major exposure of the contradictions within the new European scabs.

The participants of the Karlovy Vary meeting issued a declaration full of abstract talk about "European peace." They claimed that this declaration was an "action program" for "struggling for European peace and security."

TASS reported, "Under Brezhnev's chairmanship, the meeting unanimously adopted the documents representing the conference—the declaration 'For European Peace and Security' and the final communiqué." In Brezhnev's view, this "unanimity" under his "chairmanship" was something to boast about.

In reality, their "unanimity" on the peace issue exposed the true faces of these scabs. This was similar to Kautsky's boasting about the "unanimity" of the traitors of the Second International.

Lenin said: "In Kautsky's view, the unity shown by the social-chauvinists who betrayed socialism in deceiving the workers was the 'unanimity' of the Second International on the peace issue."

In using the empty talk of "peace" to dull the revolutionary will of the working class, the new scabs of Brezhnev and his ilk were even more shameless than the old traitors of Kautsky.

On the issue of "European peace and security," the Karlovy Vary meeting spouted a lot of clichés, some borrowed from old revisionists, some from Khrushchev, some from Tito, and some from imperialists. They talked about reducing armaments, dissolving the two military blocs, establishing a European collective security system, European cooperation, convening a European states conference, and uniting with the socialists, among other things. The 7,000-character declaration was full of deceptive content aimed at the people.

The essence of this reactionary and hypocritical "European peace and security" declaration was to oppose the proletarian revolution, oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, and maintain the rule of imperialism, capitalism, and revisionism in Europe.

The "European peace" advocated by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk meant the "peaceful" transformation of socialist countries into capitalist countries, the "peaceful" endurance of oppression and exploitation by the working class in capitalist countries, and the "peaceful" degeneration of communist and workers' parties into new social democratic parties.

The "European security" advocated by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk meant the security of the bourgeois privileged class in countries where the revisionist clique is in power, the security of the reactionary ruling class in imperialist and capitalist countries, and the security of a small group of traitors and scabs within the modern revisionist-controlled communist and workers' parties.

The Karlovy Vary meeting was a meeting to serve U.S. imperialism. They desperately maintained "European peace and security" to help U.S. imperialism "stabilize" Europe, suppress the world people's revolutionary movements, suppress the burgeoning national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, Latin America, especially Southeast Asia, and expand the Vietnam War. The so-called "aid to Vietnam" appeal issued by the Karlovy Vary meeting was a smokescreen to cover their counterrevolutionary purposes of serving U.S. imperialism.

The Karlovy Vary meeting usurped the name of the "European Communist and Workers' Parties." Who are they? The Soviet Brezhnev, Kosygin clique, the East German Ulbricht clique, the Polish Gomulka clique, the Czechoslovak Novotny clique, the Bulgarian Zhivkov clique, the Hungarian Kadar clique, the French Roger clique, the Italian Longo clique, the British Gollan clique, the Spanish Ibarruri clique, and so on, are all traitors to Marxism-Leninism, scabs of the working class, and enemies of revolutionary communist parties.

The Karlovy Vary meeting was a meeting of representatives of the bourgeois privileged class in the Soviet and Eastern European countries and agents of the bourgeoisie in some European capitalist countries. It was a meeting where the new social democratic parties further collaborated with the old social democratic parties. The new social democratic parties in Europe, together with the old social democratic parties, became the "maintenance committees" for all reactionary regimes, reactionary systems, and reactionary forces.

The Karlovy Vary meeting reflected the panic and desperate struggles of the international bourgeoisie.

The Karlovy Vary meeting inherited Khrushchev's revisionism and reaffirmed the line of capitulation and peaceful coexistence from the 20th Congress of the CPSU, attempting to save the shaky rule of imperialism and capitalism. However, no matter how sincerely Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk tried to help imperialism, corrupt the working class, and oppose and sabotage the revolution, they could not save the inevitable doom of imperialism and capitalism.

Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of history, revolution will occur sooner or later and will inevitably triumph."

The widespread dissemination of great Mao Zedong Thought around the world and the powerful influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are further promoting the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America and further awakening the new consciousness of the working class and laboring people in Europe, North America, and Oceania.

In Europe, the great socialist beacon of Albania shines brightly.

The Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations in various European countries are growing and strengthening. We are confident that, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, these parties and organizations will unite and lead the European working class and laboring people to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, capitalism, and revisionism and achieve their own complete liberation.

    欧洲新工贼的破产
    观察家
    四月二十四日到二十六日，苏联修正主义领导集团，纠合他们的一小撮欧洲追随者，在捷克斯洛伐克的卡罗维发利，举行了一个反革命黑会。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，为了这个会议的召开，整整忙碌了一年。他们原想热热闹闹地开上四天，造点声势，给现代修正主义者们壮壮胆，打打气。但是，只开了两天半，就开不下去了。勃列日涅夫挟起皮包走路，会议提前草草收场。
    这是欧洲新工贼大破产的一次会议。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，为了拼凑这个会议，四出奔走，软硬兼施，费尽了气力。但是，到会的还是七零八落，参差不齐。一些党不服从苏修的指挥棒，拒绝出席会议。至于铁托叛徒集团没有到会，是要保持它充当美帝国主义老走狗的特殊地位。
    这次会议，是苏修策划进一步反华的会议。在会上，勃列日涅夫带头反华。在会下，他们一伙进行了紧张的反华活动。但是，敢于在这个会上公开跳出来反华的人，寥寥无几。他们还极力表白，反华问题“没有列入这次会议的议程”。为什么会出现这种怪现象呢？这不过是企图增加会议的欺骗性，企图逃避马克思列宁主义者和革命人民对他们的揭露和批判。这表明苏修要在这样的会议上，公开打出联合反华的旗号，遇到了困难。这暴露了反华英雄们的狼狈相：反华好，反不了。
    这次会议，本来是苏修为拼凑全世界叛徒工贼大集会作准备的。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，早就叫嚷，要召开什么“新的世界共产党会议”，他们有的说“条件正在成熟”，有的说“条件日益成熟”，有的说“条件已经成熟”，七嘴八舌，吵吵嚷嚷。在卡罗维发利工贼会议上，这种叫嚷却突然消声匿迹了。是他们不想召开这种反共，反华，反人民，反革命，反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的会议了吗？当然不是。只是因为在这个问题上，工贼们有难言的苦衷，他们各有各的打算，矛盾重重，难于统一。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，本来希望通过这次会议，恢复赫鲁晓夫修正主义指挥棒的“权威”。但是，事与愿违。苏修指挥棒更加不灵了，欧洲修正主义集团各搞一套，自由行动的倾向，越来越厉害。尽管他们竭力加以掩饰，也不得不吞吞吐吐地承认，他们之间存在着“差异”，制定共同政策“不简单”，“不容易”。
    卡罗维发利会议，反映了欧洲现代修正主义的队伍，同床异梦，各怀鬼胎，分崩离析，四分五裂。这是欧洲新工贼内部矛盾的一次大暴露。
    卡罗维发利会议的参加者，抛出了一个空谈抽象的“欧洲和平”的声明。他们把这个声明说成是“争取欧洲和平与安全”的“行动纲领”。
    塔斯社报道说，“在勃列日涅夫主持会议时，一致通过了代表会议的文件——‘争取欧洲和平与安全’的声明和最后公报。”在勃列日涅夫看来，他“主持”下所表现的这种“一致”，是很值得炫耀的。
    其实，他们在和平问题上的这种“一致”，恰恰暴露了这伙工贼的真面目。这同考茨基所炫耀的第二国际叛徒们的“一致”是一样的。
    列宁说过：“在考茨基看来，叛变了社会主义的沙文主义者在竭力欺骗工人的时候所表现的一致，就是第二国际在和平问题上的‘一致’”。
    在利用“和平”的空谈麻醉工人阶级的革命意志方面，勃列日涅夫之流的新工贼，比考茨基之流的老叛徒还要无耻得多。
    卡罗维发利会议，在欧洲“和平与安全”的问题上，说了一大堆陈词滥调，有的是从老修正主义那里拣来的，有的是从赫鲁晓夫那里拣来的，有的是从铁托那里拣来的，有的是从帝国主义那里拣来的。什么裁减军备呀，废除两个军事集团呀，建立欧洲集体安全体系呀，全欧合作呀，召开欧洲国家会议呀，同社会党联合行动呀，等等。洋洋七千字的声明，尽是欺骗人民的货色。
    这个反动的和虚伪的“欧洲和平与安全”的声明，最本质的东西，就是反对无产阶级革命，反对无产阶级专政，维护帝国主义、资本主义和修正主义在欧洲的统治。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流所谓的“欧洲和平”，就是社会主义国家“和平地”向资本主义演变，就是资本主义国家的工人阶级“和平地”忍受压迫和剥削，就是共产党和工人党“和平地”蜕化为新的社会民主党。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流所谓的“欧洲安全”，在修正主义集团当权的国家，是资产阶级特权阶层的安全，在帝国主义和资本主义国家，是反动统治阶级的安全，在现代修正主义集团控制的共产党和工人党内，是一小撮叛徒和工贼的安全。
    卡罗维发利会议，是为美帝国主义效劳的会议。他们拚命维护欧洲的“和平与安全”，目的是帮助美帝国主义
  “稳定”欧洲，镇压世界人民革命运动，镇压亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲特别是东南亚正在蓬勃发展的民族解放运动，扩大侵越战争。卡罗维发利会议发出的所谓“援助”越南的呼吁书，是一种烟幕，是为了掩盖他们为美帝国主义效劳的反革命目的。
    卡罗维发利会议，盗用了“欧洲共产党和工人党”的名义。他们是什么共产党？参加会议的苏联勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团，东德乌布利希集团，波兰哥穆尔卡集团，捷克斯洛伐克诺沃提尼集团，保加利亚日夫科夫集团，匈牙利卡达尔集团，法国罗歇集团，意大利隆哥集团，英国高兰集团，西班牙伊巴露丽集团，等等，通通都是马克思列宁主义的叛徒，工人阶级的工贼，革命的共产党的敌人。
    卡罗维发利会议，是苏联东欧国家资产阶级特权阶层代表人物，和欧洲一些资本主义国家资产阶级代理人的会议，是新的社会民主党同老的社会民主党进一步同流合污的会议。欧洲的新社会民主党和老社会民主党一道，成为维持一切反动统治、反动制度、反动势力的“维持会”。
    卡罗维发利会议，反映了国际资产阶级的恐慌不安和垂死挣扎。
    卡罗维发利会议，继承了赫鲁晓夫修正主义，重申了苏共二十大投降共处的路线，妄图挽救帝国主义、资本主义摇摇欲坠的统治。但是，不论勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流怎样竭诚为帝国主义帮忙，腐蚀工人阶级，反对和破坏革命，都绝对不能挽救帝国主义和资本主义必然灭亡的命运。
    毛泽东同志说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，中国无产阶级文化大革命在全世界的强大影响，正在进一步推动亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的革命斗争，正在进一步唤起欧洲、北美、大洋洲工人阶级和劳动人民的新觉醒。
    在欧洲，阿尔巴尼亚这盏伟大的社会主义明灯光芒四射。
    欧洲各国马克思列宁主义政党和组织，正在成长壮大。我们深信，这些政党和组织，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，团结和领导欧洲工人阶级和劳动人民，一定能够推翻帝国主义、资本主义和修正主义的反动统治，赢得自身的彻底解放。
