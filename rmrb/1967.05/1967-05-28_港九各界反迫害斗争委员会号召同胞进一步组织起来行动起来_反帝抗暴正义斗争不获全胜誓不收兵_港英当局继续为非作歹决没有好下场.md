Chairman Mao said: "Beginning with the intention to harm others, ending with harming oneself. This will be the development law of all reactionary policies."

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Struggle Against Oppression Committee calls on compatriots to further organize and take action

The struggle against imperialism and violence will not end until complete victory is achieved; the Hong Kong British authorities will meet a bad end if they continue to act wickedly

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, May 27th - The Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Struggle Against Oppression Committee issued a statement on the 26th, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British authorities on May 22nd. The statement also exposed that the Hong Kong British authorities are actively plotting to carry out new and larger-scale arrests and persecution of our compatriots, calling on Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots to take corresponding and necessary "escalation" measures to fight back against the Hong Kong British authorities' escalation of violence, and to resolutely continue this anti-imperialist and anti-violence struggle to the end.

The statement pointed out that the bloodshed in Kowloon City, San Po Kong, and Nathan Road has not yet dried, and the Hong Kong British authorities have created another horrifying bloodshed incident on May 22nd. This is an unadulterated fascist atrocity, unprecedented in scale, cruelty, and brutality. This is another "escalation" by the Hong Kong British authorities in their persecution of our patriotic compatriots. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Struggle Against Oppression Committee strongly protests this to the Hong Kong British authorities.

The statement pointed out that the May 22nd incident, meticulously planned by the Hong Kong British authorities, occurred after the Chinese government issued a protest statement on May 15th. This shows that the Hong Kong British authorities are deliberately provoking our government and the 700 million Chinese people.

The statement revealed that in recent days, the Hong Kong British authorities have hastily issued several so-called "emergency decrees": prohibiting public gatherings and demonstrations, prohibiting protests, prohibiting entry into "courts," prohibiting the use of loudspeakers for "illegal propaganda" or "incitement," and so on. They also authorized police officers to "enter any premises, conduct searches, and arrest any individuals." They use all propaganda machines to slander and threaten our patriotic compatriots, which not only shows that the Hong Kong British authorities intend to suppress our patriotic compatriots' struggle against oppression with violence but also intend to use these "laws" as an excuse to carry out a larger-scale arrest and persecution more openly and "legally." The statement emphasized that the Hong Kong British authorities arbitrarily persecute Hong Kong Chinese residents but do not allow us to speak out, protest, or resist, which is absolutely unacceptable.

The statement said that there is resistance where there is oppression. The Hong Kong British authorities, under the pretext of "maintaining order," use violence to suppress, which will inevitably lead to resistance. From San Po Kong to Garden Road and Iron Gate, from "prisons" to "courts," under the sound of guns and the shadow of clubs, in the face of severe torture and iron chains, our Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, bravely advance, fearing no sacrifice, and resolutely carry out the struggle against oppression. This fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation to fight to the end with its enemies. The Hong Kong British authorities overestimate their own strength and underestimate the patriotic power of the Chinese compatriots, continuing to act wickedly, which will definitely not end well.

The statement emphasized that since the Hong Kong British authorities use all kinds of treacherous and vicious means to "escalate" the atrocities against Chinese compatriots, we Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots also have the right to use various means to struggle, to escalate the struggle against oppression in a tit-for-tat manner, and to resolutely see it through to the end. We call on everyone to further organize and take action, adopting corresponding and necessary "escalation" measures. If the Hong Kong British authorities dare to interfere, then all serious consequences must be borne by the Hong Kong British authorities.

The statement sternly warned the Hong Kong British authorities: the five demands proposed by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the four demands we proposed must be accepted unconditionally and immediately. This is your only way out; there is no other alternative.

The statement concluded by saying that our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries' intentions are to use slaughter to eliminate the revolution. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will be. However, contrary to this reactionary subjective wish, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force will be, and the closer the reactionaries will be to annihilation. This is an irresistible law." We solemnly declare: the Chinese government and the 700 million people are our strong backing, and the great leader Chairman Mao is our solid support. We will definitely carry this struggle against oppression to the end. We will not lay down our arms until we achieve complete victory!

### 港九各界反迫害斗争委员会号召同胞进一步组织起来行动起来  反帝抗暴正义斗争不获全胜誓不收兵  港英当局继续为非作歹决没有好下场

    港九各界反迫害斗争委员会号召同胞进一步组织起来行动起来
    反帝抗暴正义斗争不获全胜誓不收兵  港英当局继续为非作歹决没有好下场
    新华社香港二十七日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会二十六日发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局制造“五·二二”法西斯暴行。声明还揭露港英当局正在积极策划阴谋，准备对我同胞进行新的更大规模的搜捕和迫害，号召港九同胞采取相应的和必要的“升级”措施，对港英当局把暴行“升级”的行动进行针锋相对的斗争，坚决把这场反帝抗暴斗争进行到底。
    声明指出，九龙城砦、新蒲岗、弥敦道的血迹未干，港英当局又制造了骇人听闻的“五·二二”流血事件，这是不折不扣的法西斯暴行，其规模之大，手段之毒辣，行动之凶残，是空前的。这是港英当局迫害我爱国同胞的又一次“升级”。港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会为此向港英当局提出最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出，港英当局精心策划的这次“五·二二”事件，是在我国政府五月十五日发表抗议声明以后发生的。这表明港英当局蓄意向我政府和七亿中国人民挑衅。
    声明揭露说，连日以来，港英当局又急急忙忙地颁布了几项所谓“紧急法令”：不准群众游行集会，不准示威抗议，不准进入“法院”，不准使用扩音器作“非法宣传”或“煽动性的宣传广播”，等等。并且规定可“授权”警方人员“进入任何屋宇，进行搜查和拘捕任何人物”。他们利用一切宣传机器对我爱国同胞进行造谣诬蔑和恐吓威胁，这不仅表明港英当局企图用暴力压制我爱国同胞的反迫害斗争，而且企图以这些“法律”为借口，更加公开“合法”地进行一场更大规模的搜捕和迫害。声明强调，港英当局对香港中国居民随意迫害，却不许我们开口控诉，出声抗议，更不许我们反抗，这是绝对办不到的。
    声明说，有压迫就有反抗。港英当局借口“维持治安”，用暴力进行镇压，就必然会引起反抗。从新蒲岗到花园道和铁岗，从“监牢”到“法庭”，在枪声棍影之下，在严刑铁索面前，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我们港九同胞，前赴后继，不怕牺牲，坚决进行反迫害斗争，充分表现了中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的英雄气概。港英当局过高估计自己的力量，过低估计中国同胞的爱国力量，张牙舞爪，继续作恶，是绝对不会有好下场的。
    声明强调指出，港英当局既然使用一切阴险毒辣的手段，把迫害中国同胞的暴行“升级”，我们港九同胞也就取得使用各种各样办法进行斗争的权利，针锋相对地把反迫害斗争“升级”，坚决奉陪到底。我们号召大家进一步组织起来，行动起来，采取相应的和必要的“升级”措施。如果港英当局胆敢横加干预，那么一切严重后果必须由港英当局承担。
    声明严正警告港英当局：我国外交部提出的五项要求和我们提出的四项要求，必须迅速无条件接受。这是你们的唯一出路，此外别无他途。
    声明最后说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”我们庄严宣告：我国政府和七亿人民是我们的强大后盾，伟大的领袖毛主席是我们的牢固靠山，我们一定要把这场反迫害斗争进行到底。不获全胜，誓不收兵！
