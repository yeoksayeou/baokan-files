Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao Celebrate May Day with Three Million People in the Capital

"On the night of May 1st, they again gathered with a million people and foreign friends from five continents to watch fireworks. Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and other central and departmental leaders also joined the masses in celebrating the day of unity and struggle. The hearts of ten million people surged with emotion, singing and dancing, wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Wishing Comrade Lin Biao good health forever! Determined to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: Our country's people and the people of the world love and respect the great leader Chairman Mao the most. Today, he and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao celebrated the international labor day with three million revolutionary masses in the capital and with hundreds of millions of people across the country.

"The great teacher, the great leader, the great supreme commander, and the great helmsman Chairman Mao lives forever! Forever! Ten thousand years!" Our deputy supreme commander Comrade Lin Biao's inscription for this year's May Day International Labor Day most concisely expresses the boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration of hundreds of millions of people for Chairman Mao, becoming the most resounding song of praise throughout today's festive activities.

"Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived!" At half past twelve, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao arrived at the Workers' Cultural Palace in an open-top car. At that moment, the Workers' Cultural Palace erupted in excitement, and a wave of happiness surged through everyone's hearts. The sky echoed with shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao forever!" Millions of happy faces welcomed our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, and millions of red hearts beat fiercely, wishing our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! Wishing Comrade Lin Biao good health! Forever healthy!

Chairman Mao's open-top car, amidst the surging cheers, drove out of the Workers' Cultural Palace and arrived at Zhongshan Park. Chairman Mao's face was radiant, and his spirits were high. Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao repeatedly waved to the crowd, congratulating them on the festival, and saluting the revolutionary masses who are advancing bravely in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and saluting the revolutionary fighters and international friends from the five continents.

Behind the open-top car carrying Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, there were three more open-top cars carrying Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Xie Fuzhi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Jiang Qing, Wang Li, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Ye Qun, and other responsible comrades.

Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, after meeting with the revolutionary masses of the capital in the afternoon, tonight again gathered with a million revolutionary masses and foreign friends from the five continents on Tiananmen Square and Tiananmen Gate to celebrate the night of May 1st. The people of the capital, immersed in boundless happiness and joy, used thousands of songs and dances to bless Chairman Mao with eternal life! Eternal life!

"Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the helmsman of the world revolution, you are the brightest red sun in our hearts. We think of you day and night. Tonight, we can see you in front of Tiananmen, this is our greatest, greatest happiness!" Everyone gathered on Tiananmen Square was filled with such excitement, eagerly awaiting the happy moment. The happy moment arrived! At 8:40 in the evening, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, arrived in the crowd in open-top cars. "Chairman Mao has arrived! Chairman Mao has arrived!" At this moment, Tiananmen Square was in a state of great excitement, with waves of cheers rising higher and higher. Chairman Mao was in high spirits, smiling and waving to the crowd from the open-top car.

This year's May Day International Labor Day coincides with the surging revolutionary tide of the people of the world against imperialism led by the United States, against modern revisionism led by the Soviet revisionist leadership, and against the reactionaries of various countries. It also coincides with the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and the high tide of mass criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. The revolutionary masses of the capital, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiastically hailed the great new victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the great new victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and were determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end with unshakable confidence.

Today, the capital is bathed in sunshine, basking in the glory of Mao Zedong Thought. The celebration activities are centered around eight major parks, including the Workers' Cultural Palace, Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Park, and Zhongshan Park. A giant portrait of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of our country and the people of the world, hangs in the center of the red wall of Tiananmen Gate. Giant portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin stand tall on both sides of the square. Many tall buildings are adorned with giant revolutionary slogans. The city is filled with red flags, singing voices, and a festive atmosphere.

Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao came among the people, greatly encouraging the revolutionary masses of the capital who are carrying out the revolutionary criticism movement. Millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres, filled with revolutionary passion, sang and danced, using spoken word, quick-talk, songs, dances, and dramas as weapons of struggle to expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party from all angles. The revolutionary masses of the capital, who just celebrated the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee eleven days ago, have gathered again today. They are determined to raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to combine the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party with the thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and to combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own units. At the same time, they will further advance and consolidate revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination in the revolutionary criticism movement.

The workers and peasants of the capital, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and inspired by the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Cadres in All Factories and Mines Across the Country" and the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural Areas Across the Country," are seizing the revolution and promoting production, using revolution to guide production and using revolution to drive production, achieving double victories in revolution and production.

The revolutionary workers of the glorious revolutionary struggle tradition of the No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory sang joyfully, celebrating their victories in implementing Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "grasp revolution, promote production." Since the revolutionary workers and rebels of this factory seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party in late January, they have completed their production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfilled them every month for the past three months. In April, they created a new historical high for the factory. The red rebels met the great leader Chairman Mao today, recalling the fierce struggles and achievements of the Cultural Revolution, feeling boundless happiness. They said: All this is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The poor and lower-middle peasants who are fighting on the front lines of agricultural production arrived in the city early in the morning, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao, to celebrate the festival with the workers. Three representatives from the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress from Fengtai District gathered together, excitedly saying: We poor and lower-middle peasants love to read Chairman Mao's books the most and love to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We respond to Chairman Mao's call, completing the spring sowing on time, and making the spring plowing production better than ever before.

The representatives of the Shanghai and Shanxi Revolutionary Committees, who came to Beijing to congratulate the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, were warmly welcomed at the Workers' Cultural Palace. The deputy leader of the Shanxi delegation, Chen Yonggui, and other representatives first went among the poor and lower-middle peasants to celebrate with everyone. The propaganda teams of Mao Zedong Thought composed of poor and lower-middle peasants from Haidian District's Siqing People's Commune, Yuanyuan People's Commune, and Dongsheng People's Commune sang "Learn from Dazhai, catch up with Dazhai, let the red flowers of Dazhai bloom everywhere!" expressing the enthusiasm of the capital's poor and lower-middle peasants in responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." A standing committee member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and a standing committee member of the Beijing Municipal Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants' Congress, Deng Wandi, said to Chen Yonggui: "We poor and lower-middle peasants of the capital regard you as our teacher!" Chen Yonggui said: "We will jointly raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, learn from each other, and do a good job in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction!"

The giant slogans "Firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people!" and "Learn from the great People's Liberation Army!" are prominently displayed in various recreational venues. Many soldiers who saw our brightest red sun, Chairman Mao, were filled with tears of excitement, repeatedly telling their comrades about their happy encounter with Chairman Mao. They are determined to better carry forward the glorious tradition of the army loving the people, to better complete the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training assigned by Chairman Mao, and to make greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Many "Red First Company" and "Heroic Eighth Platoon" that participated in the liberation of Beijing, and many four-good companies, five-good soldiers, and active learners of Chairman Mao's works, celebrated with the revolutionary masses, sang and danced together, and were very close. Some of them gathered together to exchange experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres performed art programs such as "The PLA and the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Have United Hearts" and "Red Guards Learn from the PLA," praising the great contributions of the People's Liberation Army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and were determined to learn from the PLA to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to build the capital into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

On the stages and open-air performance venues of various parks, theaters, and clubs throughout the city, revolutionary cultural workers and cultural warriors from factories, rural areas, the army, and schools performed rich and varied revolutionary dramas and dances that shone with the glory of Mao Zedong Thought, showcasing the abundant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the revolutionary masses celebrating the festival once again saw and heard the first batch of revolutionary model operas in our country—Beijing opera "The Red Detachment of Women," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "Shajiabang," ballet "The White-Haired Girl," and symphonic music "Shajiabang"; saw a large number of revolutionary songs and dances born in the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, praising our great leader, great party, great country, great people, and great army; saw sharp and powerful performances aimed at imperialism, modern revisionism, reactionaries of various countries, and the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the party. These performances fully demonstrated the great achievements and boundless power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in literature and art.

Today, in the central venues of the celebration of the revolutionary masses of the capital, such as the Workers' Cultural Palace, Zhongshan Park, and the Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Park, there are giant slogans hanging, saying: "Workers of the world, unite! Workers and oppressed peoples and nations of the world, unite!" "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership!" "Firmly support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national liberation!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries!" Many revolutionary masses performed musical and dance performances such as "Liberate the South," "The People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America Want Liberation," "Anti-Imperialism Must Be Anti-Revisionism," and "Down with the Indonesian Reactionaries."

International communist warriors and foreign friends from the five continents also celebrated this common festival of the proletariat and laboring people of the world with the revolutionary masses of the capital. Wherever they went, they were greeted with applause and warmly welcomed. They rhythmically shouted: "Mao Zedong—Mao Zedong!" and sang "The East Is Red" and "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helmsman" with the people of Beijing in different languages, and sang "The Internationale."

Vice chairmen of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee Wu De, Zheng Weishan, Fu Chongbi, Nie Yuanzi, and other standing committee members and committee members also celebrated the festival with the revolutionary masses of the capital.

At 9:40 in the evening, the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao ascended Tiananmen Gate in the majestic music of "The East Is Red." Immediately, Tiananmen Square erupted with cheers that shook the heavens. Ascending Tiananmen Gate were also central and departmental leaders Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Zhu De, Li Fuchun, Chen Yun, Dong Biwu, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Li Shengfeng, Xie Fuzhi, Liu Ningyi, Xiao Hua, Yang Chengwu, Su Yu, Jiang Qing, and others.

Our great supreme commander Chairman Mao and deputy supreme commander Comrade Lin Biao walked from the west side of Tiananmen Gate to the east side, and then from the east side to the west side, shaking hands and talking with leaders from various departments and representatives of the revolutionary masses, as well as international friends from the five continents, celebrating the day of unity and struggle of the proletariat of the world. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and international friends raised their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" high, jumping and shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao forever!"

Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao received representatives of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and representatives of the Shanghai and Shanxi Revolutionary Committees on Tiananmen Gate. The representatives who were received said excitedly: Chairman Mao cares for the revolutionary masses the most and supports the revolutionary masses the most. We revolutionary masses also love Chairman Mao the most and are loyal to Chairman Mao. We rely on Mao Zedong Thought to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and we will also rely on Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use power well. We will firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life.

The revolutionary masses of the capital were so excited today that they could not calm down for a long time. They repeatedly expressed their boundless excitement: "Too happy, too happy, we will never forget this happy day in our life!" A standing committee member of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee and a standing committee member of the Workers' Congress, Xu Jia, said: Chairman Mao shook my hand, and I felt that the burden on my shoulders is heavier, and the strength in my body is greater. We will firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call, criticize, overthrow, and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, thoroughly smash the former Beijing Municipal Committee, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on all fronts in the capital. We workers will also help the oppressed peoples and nations of the world to liberate themselves from the reactionary rule of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. Many Red Guards were filled with passion, saying: On the day of celebrating the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country, Chairman Mao met with the revolutionary masses, once again showing that our great leader Chairman Mao cares for the masses the most, is closest to the masses, and is united with the masses. "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao." We Red Guards will always listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Some soldiers of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Liberation Army, after seeing Chairman Mao, excitedly expressed that in the future, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, listen to Chairman Mao's words, better rely on the masses, trust the masses, and firmly complete the tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training assigned by Chairman Mao, and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Tonight, Tiananmen Square and the east and west Chang'an Streets are brightly lit, and revolutionary songs such as "The Boat Sails on the Sea Depends on the Helmsman" resonate through the sky. Colorful fireworks symbolizing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shine brightly, making the night sky of the capital even more beautiful.

    来京祝贺北京市革命委员会成立的上海、山西革命委员会代表团来到劳动人民文化宫，受到热烈欢迎。山西代表团副团长陈永贵等代表首先来到贫下中农中间同大家一起联欢，海淀区四季青人民公社、玉渊潭人民公社和东升人民公社贫下中农组成的毛泽东思想宣传队，高唱“学大寨，赶大寨，大寨的红花遍地开！”表示首都贫下中农热烈响应毛主席关于“农业学大寨”的伟大号召。北京市革命委员会常委、北京市贫下中农代表会议常委邓万田对陈永贵说：“我们首都的贫下中农拜你为师！”陈永贵说：“我们要一齐高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，互相学习，共同搞好无产阶级文化大革命，搞好社会主义建设！”
    “坚决响应毛主席拥军爱民的伟大号召！”“向伟大的中国人民解放军学习！”的巨幅标语，醒目地悬挂在各个游园场所。许多见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的解放军指战员，满含着激动的泪花，一遍又一遍地向战友们叙述他们见到毛主席的幸福情景。他们决心更好地发扬我军爱民的光荣传统，更好地完成毛主席交给的支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等光荣任务，在无产阶级文化大革命中做出更大的贡献。当年参加过解放北平的“红一连”和某部“英雄八班”等许多四好连队、五好战士和学习毛主席著作积极分子，与革命群众联欢，一起歌唱，一起跳舞，亲密无间。有的还聚在一起，交流活学活用毛主席著作和无产阶级文化大革命的经验。广大革命的工人、农民、学生和干部，表演了《解放军和贫下中农心连心》、《红卫兵学习解放军》等文艺节目，他们异口同声地赞扬人民解放军在无产阶级文化大革命中作出的伟大贡献，决心象解放军那样活学活用毛主席著作，把首都建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    在全市各个公园、剧场、俱乐部的舞台和露天演出广场上，革命的文艺工作者和来自工厂、农村、部队、学校的毛泽东思想宣传队、业余演出队的文艺战士们，演出了丰富多采的闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的革命戏剧、革命歌舞，展示出了无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。在毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的前夕，欢庆节日的革命群众，再度看到和听到我国第一批革命样板戏——京剧《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》和交响音乐《沙家浜》；看到了大批在无产阶级文化大革命斗争中诞生的歌颂我们伟大的领袖、伟大的党、伟大的国家、伟大的人民、伟大的军队的革命歌舞，看到了匕首般刺向帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派和党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的战斗节目。这些节目，充分显示了毛主席无产阶级革命文艺路线取得的伟大成就和无穷的威力。
    今天，在首都革命群众欢聚的中心劳动人民文化宫、中山公园和工农兵公园等场所，悬挂的巨幅标语上写着：“全世界无产者联合起来，全世界无产者同被压迫人民、被压迫民族联合起来！”“打倒以美国为首的帝国主义！”“打倒以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义！”“坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国战争！”“坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争！”许多革命群众表演了《解放南方》、《亚非拉人民要解放》、《反帝必反修》、《打倒印尼反动派》等音乐舞蹈节目。
    来自世界五大洲的国际共产主义战士和外国朋友也同首都无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一道，欢度这个全世界无产阶级和劳动人民共同的节日。他们走到那里，那里就激起一片掌声，受到极其热烈的欢迎。他们有节奏地欢呼：“毛泽东——毛泽东！”同首都人民齐唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》，还用不同语言高唱《国际歌》。
    北京市革命委员会副主任委员吴德、郑维山、傅崇碧、聂元梓，以及常委和委员也都同首都革命群众一道欢度节日。
    九时四十分，伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中，登上天安门城楼。顿时，天安门广场上爆发出响彻天际的欢呼声。登上天安门城楼的，还有中央和各方面的负责同志周恩来、陈伯达、康生、朱德、李富春、陈云、董必武、陈毅、李先念、谭震林、徐向前、聂荣臻、叶剑英、李雪峰、谢富治、刘宁一、萧华、杨成武、粟裕、江青等。
    我们的伟大统帅毛主席和副统帅林彪同志，从天安门城楼西侧走到城楼的东侧，又由城楼的东侧走到城楼的西侧，同各方面的负责同志和革命群众代表，以及来自五大洲的国际友人亲切握手、谈话，共庆全世界无产阶级团结战斗的节日。广大工人、农民、人民解放军指战员、革命干部、红卫兵小将、革命师生和国际友人，把手中红彤彤的《毛主席语录》高举起来，跳跃着高呼：“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”“毛主席万岁，万万岁！”
    毛主席和林彪同志在天安门城楼上，接见了北京市革命委员会的同志和上海市、山西省革命委员会代表团的同志，被接见的同志们激动地说：毛主席最关心无产阶级革命派，最支持无产阶级革命派，我们无产阶级革命派也最热爱毛主席，无限忠于毛主席。我们靠毛泽东思想胜利地夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，我们还要用毛泽东思想掌好权，用好权。我们坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
    首都革命群众今天两次见到毛主席，都兴奋得久久不能平静，他们一遍又一遍地倾吐无限激动的心情：“太幸福了，太幸福了，我们一辈子都忘不了今天这个幸福的日子！”北京市革命委员会常委、工代会常委徐铠说：毛主席握过我的手，我感到肩上的担子更重了，身上的力量更大了。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批垮、批臭，把旧北京市委彻底砸烂，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍首都的所有的阵地。我们工人阶级还要帮助世界被压迫的人民和民族，从帝、修、反的反动统治下解放出来，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全球。许多红卫兵小将满怀激情地说：在举国欢庆无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的日子里，毛主席会见革命群众，再一次表明，我们伟大的领袖毛主席最关心群众，最深入群众，和群众心连心。“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”我们红卫兵永远听毛主席的话，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。中国人民解放军北京部队某部的一些战士，见到毛主席后激动地表示，今后我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，更好地依靠群众，信任群众，坚决完成毛主席交给我们的支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等任务，为无产阶级文化大革命作出新贡献。
    今晚，雄伟的天安门广场和东西长安街灯火辉煌，《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌声响彻云霄。五彩缤纷的象征着无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火光芒四射的礼花，一阵阵腾空升起，把首都的夜空打扮得更加绚丽动人。首都百万革命群众幸福地在最最敬爱的领袖毛主席身边欢庆节日，并将以新的战斗姿态，争取无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设的新胜利。
