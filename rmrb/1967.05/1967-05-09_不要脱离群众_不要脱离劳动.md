Chairman Mao has said: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords who lord it over the people. Cadres maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people through participating in collective production labor. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism and prevent revisionism and dogmatism."

After taking power, the proletarian revolutionary factions must adhere to Chairman Mao's teachings, continue to maintain the character of the laboring people, uphold the glorious traditions of the Party, and not break away from the masses or from labor. If one becomes a committee member or a representative and is elevated above others, spending all day issuing orders from the office, then one will become estranged from the masses, will not be able to reflect the masses' opinions, and will not be able to represent the masses well. An old worker from the Beijing Jade Factory said well:

"One must never break away from the masses. Without the support of the masses, the seal of office loses its authority."

The dictatorship of the proletariat has such high authority precisely because it represents the interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring people, and is built on the strong foundation of hundreds of millions of people.

Since the proletarian revolutionary factions have been able to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they will certainly be able to thoroughly smash the old, bureaucratic institutions that are detached from the masses, and establish a revolutionary power organ that is highly proletarianized, highly combat-ready, and highly integrated with the masses.

To achieve this, the proletarian revolutionary factions must undergo a thorough revolution in their ideology, work, style, and life.

### 不要脱离群众　不要脱离劳动

    不要脱离群众　不要脱离劳动
    毛主席说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”
    无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，一定要遵照毛主席的教导，继续保持劳动人民的本色，保持党的光荣传统，不要脱离群众，不要脱离劳动。如果当了委员，当了代表，高高在上，整天坐在办公室里发号施令，那就会同群众疏远了，就不能把群众的意见反映上来，也就不能很好地代表群众了。北京玉器厂的一个老工人说得好：
  “可千万不能脱离群众，失去了群众的拥护，大印也就没有权威了。”
    无产阶级专政，为什么有高度的权威？就是因为它是代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民利益的，是建立在亿万群众的强大基础之上的。
    无产阶级革命派既然能够从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中把权夺过来，就一定能够彻底粉碎旧的、脱离群众的、官僚主义的机构，建立一个非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化、非常群众化的革命权力机构。
    而要做到这一点，无产阶级革命派就非得在思想上、工作上、作风上、生活上来一个彻底的革命化不可。
