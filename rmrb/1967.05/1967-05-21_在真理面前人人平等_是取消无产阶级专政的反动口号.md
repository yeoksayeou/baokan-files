The "Report Outline" concocted by the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Peng Zhen himself, under the support of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, is a thoroughly revisionist program, a program for the restoration of capitalism. The authors of the "Outline" put forward the slogan "In front of truth, all are equal," which is a reactionary slogan to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement bourgeois dictatorship.

Between antagonistic classes, between Marxist truth and the fallacies of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, there is no equality whatsoever.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is considered a fragrant flower or a poisonous weed varies with each class, stratum, and social group." The truth of the proletariat is slandered by the bourgeoisie as "heresy"; while the so-called "fragrant flowers" of the bourgeoisie are precisely the poisonous weeds we must uproot. The proletariat represents the direction of historical development; its class interests are in harmony with the objective laws of social development. Therefore, only the proletariat can grasp objective truth. The so-called "truth" of the reactionary, decaying bourgeoisie can only be fallacies that go against the tide of the times and defy objective laws. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between Marxist truth and bourgeois fallacies, is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind; there can be no equality.

Truth is class-based. Different classes have diametrically opposed attitudes towards Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Revolutionary people have boundless love, faith, respect, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought, while the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique detest Mao Zedong Thought to the core. Their vicious attacks on Mao Zedong Thought have reached a level of extreme indignation and intolerance. This is a life-and-death class struggle; how can there be any "equality"?

The Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, in the "Report Outline," threw out the slogan "In front of truth, all are equal" with its sinister plot.

We know that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power; all class struggles are political struggles, all centered on the struggle for state power. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is ultimately about the struggle for state power.

For seventeen years since liberation, counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the Party have used their usurped leadership in the ideological realm to relentlessly create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. "The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not cease." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, from the very beginning, was a struggle by the proletariat to seize power from the representatives of the bourgeoisie, a struggle to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat over the reactionary "academic authorities" of the bourgeoisie and the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party who support and shield them. The handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party represent the interests of the bourgeoisie. The contradiction between the proletariat and them is the main contradiction that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to resolve. The main purpose of this great revolution is to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, especially the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party.

The authors of the "Report Outline" are also well aware of this. Therefore, just as the revolutionary masses of the proletariat launched a counterattack against the bourgeoisie, they suddenly raised the tattered flag of "In front of truth, all are equal," completely denying the class nature of truth, denying that all class struggles are political struggles, and spreading the idea that "all different opinions (including anti-Marxist-Leninist views) should be fully expressed." They did not mention the need to criticize wrong ideas at all. Obviously, their goal is to abolish the class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie in all spheres of the superstructure, to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie.

At that time, the Peng Zhen revisionist clique went around persuading people, saying nonsense like "Every article should be divided into two parts, including Yao Wenyuan's article." Peng Zhen himself went to encourage Wu Han, saying: "Admit your mistakes and insist on what is right, uphold the truth, and correct the errors." It is clear that they were trying to deceive the masses, distort right and wrong, shield the bourgeois rightists, and attack the revolutionary masses of the proletariat under the reactionary slogan of "In front of truth, all are equal." They said a lot of nonsense, but in the end, it was all about making people throw the dictatorship of the proletariat to the winds. If everyone is pursuing and exploring the same "truth," they can "equally" and "freely" engage in academic discussions, then what is the need for the proletariat to implement dictatorship over the bourgeoisie? What is the need for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution?

The history of human civilization is a history of class struggle, a history of the victory of some classes and the annihilation of others. In class society, the struggle between antagonistic classes, the struggle between antagonistic classes in various spheres of the superstructure, has no equality. Although the bourgeoisie and revisionists sing sweetly, they have never allowed the proletariat to have any equality with the bourgeoisie. When they are in power, they always use the state machinery they control to suppress the spread of proletarian thought. For example, since the birth of Marxism, the bourgeoisie has never treated it "equally," but has always sought to destroy it. As the Communist Manifesto points out: "All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies."

Those bourgeois representatives who hide in the Communist Party and wave the red flag to oppose the red flag have never allowed the proletariat to talk about any "equality." For many years, these Khrushchev-like figures have allowed Wu Han, Deng Tuo, and other ghosts and snakes to come out, inciting them to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities. Yet, they have long suppressed and refused to publish articles by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat that expose and criticize these poisonous weeds. Is this "equality"?

Under their control, the old Propaganda Department and the old Cultural Department gave the green light to feudal dramas about emperors, generals, talents, and beauties, allowing "famous, foreign, and ancient" works to flood the cultural market. They stubbornly opposed the revolution of Peking Opera and obstructed the performance of revolutionary modern plays in every possible way, using old Peking Opera to carry out capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Is this "equality"?

During the Cultural Revolution, they formulated and implemented a bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing different opinions, implementing white terror, labeling revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries" and "fake leftists, true rightists," and overthrowing all cadres who wanted to revolt. Is this also "equality"?

Under the pretext of "everything for equality, there is no dictatorship," they are engaged in the evil deed of abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and implementing bourgeois dictatorship. This is the trick of all revisionists. The fact that the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party support and concoct the "Report Outline" is a complete exposure of their revisionist reactionary essence. Lenin once drew a portrait of those who preach "liberty, equality, fraternity." He said: "Let us have less talk of 'labor democracy,' of 'liberty, equality, fraternity,' of 'citizens' rights,' and so on. Modern class-conscious workers and peasants can easily see through the deceitful tricks of the bourgeois intellectuals from these inflated phrases. Just as every experienced person can correctly judge from the 'kindly' and 'smooth' appearance and exterior of a 'good fellow' that he is 'probably a swindler.' The authors of the 'Report Outline' shout about 'In front of truth, all are equal,' are they not also thorough swindlers? If we connect this to the other fallacies proposed in the 'Outline,' we can see more clearly that this slogan is essentially to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement bourgeois dictatorship. The authors of the 'Outline' are not aggressively trying to put the leftists in the hat of 'academic despots'? They are not trying to 'rectify' the 'firm leftists'? They are not specially collecting materials from the leftists, attempting to strike at the revolutionary leftists and disintegrate the revolutionary ranks? 'The false is false, and the disguise should be stripped off.' The 'equality' they sing so sweetly is a complete deception. 'Equality' is also fascist dictatorship; 'equality' is also counter-revolutionary siege; 'equality' is also thorough bourgeois dictatorship!

If the bourgeoisie wants to implement dictatorship over us, we can only use their own methods to counter them, to implement dictatorship over them. If we talk about equality with the bourgeoisie, then when the bourgeoisie is in power, it means willingly accepting the slavery, oppression, and exploitation of the bourgeoisie; and under the dictatorship of the proletariat, it means abandoning the dictatorship of the proletariat and surrendering to the bourgeoisie, which would inevitably lead to the collapse of the socialist system and the restoration of the capitalist system.

### “在真理面前人人平等”是取消无产阶级专政的反动口号

    “在真理面前人人平等”是取消无产阶级专政的反动口号
    清华大学《井冈山》报编辑部　红勇兵　红宇
    在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，由反革命修正主义分子彭真亲自出马炮制的《汇报提纲》，是一个彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领，是一个复辟资本主义的纲领。《提纲》的作者们所提出的“在真理面前人人平等”，是一个取消无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政的反动口号。
    在互相对立的阶级之间，在马克思主义的真理同资产阶级以及一切剥削阶级的谬论之间，根本没有什么平等可言。
    毛主席教导我们说：“所谓香花和毒草，各个阶级、阶层和社会集团也有各自的看法。”无产阶级的真理，被资产阶级诬蔑为“邪说”；而资产阶级的所谓“香花”，正是我们要铲除的毒草。无产阶级代表历史发展的方向，她的阶级利益与社会发展的客观规律是一致的，因此只有无产阶级才能掌握客观真理。反动的腐朽的资产阶级的所谓“真理”，只能是违背时代潮流、违反客观规律的谬论。无产阶级同资产阶级的斗争，马克思主义的真理同资产阶级的谬论的斗争，不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，绝不可能有什么平等。
    真理是有阶级性的。不同的阶级，对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的真理抱有截然不同的态度。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子。革命人民对毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限尊敬、无限崇拜，而党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团，对毛泽东思想却深恶痛绝。他们对毛泽东思想的恶毒攻击，达到了令人极端愤慨和不能容忍的地步。这是你死我活的阶级斗争，难道能够允许有什么“平等”吗？
    彭真反革命修正主义集团在《汇报提纲》中，抛出“在真理面前人人平等”这个口号，是有其毒辣的阴谋的。
    我们知道，革命的根本问题是政权问题，一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争，都集中在争夺政权的问题上。无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态领域内的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是争夺政权的问题。
    解放十七年来，混进党内的反革命修正主义分子，利用他们篡夺的意识形态领域内的领导权，拚命为资本主义复辟制造舆论。“树欲静而风不止”。无产阶级文化大革命，一开始就是一场无产阶级向资产阶级代表人物夺权的斗争，就是要对资产阶级反动“学术权威”及背后支持、包庇他们的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派实行无产阶级专政。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，代表了资产阶级的利益。无产阶级同他们之间的矛盾，就是无产阶级文化大革命所要解决的主要矛盾。这场大革命的主要目的，就是打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，特别是打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    《汇报提纲》的作者们也很清楚这一点。因此，正当无产阶级革命派向资产阶级大举反击的时候，他们就突然打起“在真理面前人人平等”这面破旗，根本否定真理的阶级性，否定一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争，大肆散布要“让各种不同意见（包括反马克思列宁主义的东西）都充分放出来”，闭口不提对错误思想必须进行批判。显然，他们的目的，就是要取消无产阶级在上层建筑各个领域里对资产阶级进行的阶级斗争，取消无产阶级对资产阶级的专政。
    当时，彭真修正主义集团到处游说，胡说什么“对任何文章都要一分为二，对姚文元的文章也是如此。”彭真亲自出马，给吴晗打气说：“你错的就检讨，对的就坚持，坚持真理，修正错误。”事情很清楚，他们就是企图在“真理面前人人平等”的反动口号下面，欺骗群众，颠倒黑白，包庇资产阶级右派，打击无产阶级革命派。他们说了一大堆鬼话，归根到底，无非是要人们把无产阶级专政抛到九霄云外。既然人人都是为着追求和探索共同的“真理”，完全可以“平等”“自由”地进行学术讨论，那末无产阶级对资产阶级实行专政，还有什么必要呢？无产阶级文化大革命还有什么必要呢？
    一部人类文明史，就是阶级斗争史，就是一些阶级胜利、一些阶级消灭的历史。在阶级社会中，对立的阶级之间的斗争，对立的阶级在上层建筑各领域内的斗争，根本没有平等可言。尽管资产阶级和修正主义者嘴里唱得动听，但是他们从来不允许无产阶级同资产阶级有什么平等。在他们当权的时候，总是利用手中操纵的国家机器制止无产阶级思想的传播。例如，自从马克思主义诞生以来，资产阶级从来就没有“平等”地对待过她，而是必欲置之死地而后快。正如《共产党宣言》所指出的：“旧欧洲的一切势力，教皇和沙皇、梅特涅和基佐、法国的激进党人和德国的警察，都为驱除这个幽灵而结成了神圣同盟。”这种对马克思主义开展的十字军讨伐，从来没有间断过。
    那些钻在共产党内打着红旗反红旗的资产阶级代表人物，也从来不允许同无产阶级讲什么“平等”。多少年来，这些赫鲁晓夫式的人物放手让吴晗、邓拓等牛鬼蛇神出笼，怂恿他们进行反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。可是对无产阶级革命派揭露和批判这些毒草的文章，却长期扣压，不予发表。这难道是“平等”吗？
    在他们控制下的旧中宣部、旧文化部，对帝王将相、才子佳人的封建主义戏剧大开绿灯，让“名、洋、古”的作品充斥文化市场，却千方百计地顽固地反对京剧革命，百般阻挠革命现代戏的演出，利用旧京戏，进行资本主义反革命复辟活动。这难道是“平等”吗？
    在文化大革命中，他们制定并推行了一条资产阶级反动路线，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，把革命群众打成“反革命”、“假左派真右派”，把要起来革命的干部统统打倒，这难道也是“平等”吗？
    打着“一切为了平等，专政是没有的”这一幌子，干着取消无产阶级专政、实行资产阶级专政的罪恶勾当，这是一切修正主义者的惯伎。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派支持和炮制《汇报提纲》这一事实，正是他们修正主义反动本质的彻底暴露。列宁曾经给那些高谈“自由、平等、博爱”的骗子画了像。他说：“少谈些什么‘劳动民主’，什么‘自由、平等、博爱’，什么‘民权’等等空话吧。现代有觉悟的工人和农民从这些夸大的词句里，是不难看出资产阶级知识分子的欺诈手腕的。正象每个有生活经验的人望见‘善良君子’极‘光滑的’面貌和外表，就能一下子正确地断定他‘大概是个骗子’。”《汇报提纲》的作者们高叫什么“在真理面前人人平等”，不也是地地道道的大骗子吗？只要联系到《提纲》中提出的其他谬论，就可以更清楚地看到，这个口号实质上就是要取消无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政。《提纲》的作者们不是气势汹汹地要给左派戴上“学阀”的帽子吗？他们不是要对“坚定的左派”进行“整风”吗？他们不是专门收集左派的材料，妄图打击革命左派，瓦解革命队伍吗？“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”他们唱得娓娓动听的“平等”，完全是骗人的鬼把戏。“平等”者，法西斯的专制也；“平等”者，反革命的围攻也；“平等”者，地地道道的资产阶级专政也！
    来而不往，非礼也。资产阶级既然要对我们实行专政，我们只能以其人之道，还治其人之身，对他们实行专政。如果我们和资产阶级讲平等，那么，在资产阶级当权时，就意味着心甘情愿地接受资产阶级的奴役、压迫和剥削；而在无产阶级专政的条件下，就意味着放弃无产阶级专政，向资产阶级投降，那就必然导致社会主义制度崩溃，资本主义制度复辟。
