Title: We Must Grasp the Fundamental Issue of Seizing Power

The great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the drafting of the CCP Central Committee's "Notice." This great Marxist-Leninist document puts forth the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it smashes the counterrevolutionary revisionist plot of the Peng Zhen clique to fabricate the "Draft Outline Report."

The biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party, who support the Peng Zhen counterrevolutionary revisionist clique, have been claiming in various settings that the criticism of Wu Han's "Dismissal of Hai Rui" should not touch on the core issues, should not involve the issue of the dismissal of right-opportunists at the 1959 Lushan Conference, and should not discuss the anti-Party, anti-socialist issues of Wu Han and others. This is because exposing and criticizing these issues directly hits the core of the Peng Zhen counterrevolutionary revisionist clique and the core of the biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party. The issues of Wu Han are one hundred percent political issues; they are precisely the issues of these bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party and state organs and are trying to seize power from the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a political power, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counterrevolutionary class is also like this." In history, the bourgeoisie and the feudal class did this when they were fighting for power, and the proletariat did this when it was seizing power from the bourgeoisie. After the proletariat has seized power, the bourgeoisie, when trying to seize it back, will do this even more. They always use the old influence of the bourgeoisie, through newspapers, plays, films, novels, and other means, to first occupy the ideological and cultural front, to corrupt people ideologically, to carry out peaceful evolution. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

The biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party, after the liberation of the whole country, have been vigorously promoting the reactionary film "The Secret History of the Forbidden City"; in 1962, they reprinted his "Cultivation" in large quantities, and supported the "Three-Family Village" black shop to throw out "Dismissal of Hai Rui," "Night Talks on Yan Mountain," and so on. In 1966, he manipulated Peng Zhen from behind the scenes to throw out the "Draft Outline Report." These are all important steps they have taken to prepare public opinion for seizing power from the proletariat. All class enemies are the most cunning, the most treacherous, and the most vicious. They clearly hold a butcher's knife to chop off our heads, but they still put on a smiling face; they clearly sell poison, but they call it sweet dew. If we do not smash their plots and tricks, there is a danger of losing the dictatorship of the proletariat and the heads of tens of millions of people falling.

The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party are so afraid to discuss the core issues of "Dismissal of Hai Rui" because this is not just a matter of the counterrevolutionary revisionist Wu Han, but a matter of a large number of counterrevolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the Party and state organs and are about to be annihilated, a matter of exposing the Chinese Khrushchev who is sleeping by our side. They clearly know that if one Wu Han is exposed, a large number of big and small Wu Hans will be exposed; if the henchmen are caught, their master—the Peng Zhen counterrevolutionary revisionist clique, the Chinese Khrushchev—will be exposed. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party sense that their doom is approaching and cannot but fight to the death to protect their henchmen. Therefore, they do not allow the discussion of the core issues of "Dismissal of Hai Rui," which means they do not allow the discussion of the core issues of their counterrevolutionary conspiracy; they strive to save Wu Han, actually wanting to save their handful of the most dangerous schemers and conspirators to the proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The class enemy is most afraid of hitting the core, so we must firmly hit the core. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, the broad revolutionary masses are full of vigor and enthusiasm, firmly remembering Chairman Mao's teachings, and are fighting hard in the ideological and cultural field, launching big debates, big posters, big criticisms, and big discussions, exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party; and, riding on the momentum of victory, finally exposing the backstage boss of all the revisionists in China, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. The great practice of the proletarian cultural revolution over the past year has fully proven that we have hit the core of the class enemy and dug out the biggest root of evil buried in the Party and the government. This further consolidates the dictatorship of the proletariat and provides a reliable guarantee for our country to never change color.

We are revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we clearly understand: Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the class struggle is concentrated on the issue of power, that is, the proletariat wants to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. Those who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, a handful of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party and government organs, are the most dangerous enemies of subverting the dictatorship of the proletariat. Their contradictions with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals are the principal contradictions and antagonistic contradictions. We must firmly grasp the core issues, direct our firepower at the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, drag them all out, and thoroughly expose, overthrow, and defeat them, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    我们就是要抓住政权这个根本问题
    沈阳部队某部副指导员　张国珍
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》发表了。这个伟大的马克思列宁主义的文件，提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，针锋相对地粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团阴谋炮制的《汇报提纲》。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所支持的彭真反革命修正主义集团，竟然在各种场合宣称，对吴晗《海瑞罢官》的批判，不准谈要害问题，不准涉及一九五九年庐山会议对右倾机会主义分子的罢官问题，不准谈吴晗等反党反社会主义的问题。这是因为揭露、批判这些问题，恰好打中了彭真反革命修正主义集团的要害，打中了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的要害。吴晗的这些问题，是百分之百的政治问题，也正是他们这些混进党和国家机构里的资产阶级代表人物要向无产阶级夺取政权的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”历史上，资产阶级和封建阶级争夺政权的时候是这样做的，无产阶级向资产阶级夺取政权的时候也是这样做的。在无产阶级已经夺取了政权以后，资产阶级要进行反夺权，更要这样做。他们总是要利用资产阶级的旧的影响，通过报刊、戏剧、电影、小说等等，首先占领思想文化领域阵地，从思想上腐蚀人们，进行和平演变，一旦时机成熟，他们就要夺取政权，把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在全国解放以后，竭力吹捧反动影片《清宫秘史》；一九六二年大量再版他的《修养》，以及支持“三家村”黑店抛出《海瑞罢官》、《燕山夜话》等等。一九六六年他又在幕后操纵由彭真出面抛出《汇报提纲》。这些都是他们为了从无产阶级手中夺取政权作舆论准备的重要步骤。一切阶级敌人都是最狡猾、最阴险、最毒辣的。他们明明拿着屠刀要砍我们的脑袋，还装成一副笑面菩萨的样子；他们明明卖的是毒药，却把它说成是甘露。如果我们不粉碎他们的阴谋诡计，就有丧失无产阶级政权，千百万人头落地的危险。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，所以最害怕谈《海瑞罢官》的要害问题，还因为这绝不只是一个反革命修正主义分子吴晗的问题，而是关系到一大批混进党和国家机构里的反革命修正主义分子要遭到灭亡的问题，是关系到睡在我们身边的中国的赫鲁晓夫要被揭露出来的问题。他们清楚地知道，一个吴晗被揭露出来，就会有一大批大大小小的吴晗被揭露出来；爪牙被抓住了，他的主子——彭真反革命修正主义集团，中国的赫鲁晓夫就隐藏不住了。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，预感到自己的末日来临，不能不拚死地保护他们的爪牙。因此，他们不准谈《海瑞罢官》的要害问题，也就是不准谈他们反革命阴谋的要害问题；他们竭力想保住吴晗，实际上是妄想保住他们一小撮对无产阶级专政危害最大的野心家、阴谋家。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”阶级敌人最怕抓要害，我们就硬是要狠抓要害。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，广大革命群众意气风发，斗志昂扬，牢牢记住毛主席的教导，大抓思想文化领域里的阶级斗争，展开大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大批判，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭露了出来；并且乘胜追击，终于把我国修正主义分子的总后台、党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派也揭露了出来。一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践充分证明：我们正击中了阶级敌人的要害，挖出了埋藏在党和政府里的最大的祸根。这就更加巩固了无产阶级专政，为我们国家永不变色提供了可靠的保证。
    我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，根据毛主席的教导，我们清楚地认识到：在无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。打着“红旗”反红旗，混到党和政府机构内部的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是颠覆无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人。他们和广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。我们就是要狠抓要害问题，把火力对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把他们统统揪出来，彻底斗臭、斗垮、斗倒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
