Newspaper reports from Bangkok: On the 13th, the "Voice of the Thai People" radio station published an article pointing out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has become an agent for U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies. While the revolutionary peoples of the world are resolutely opposing U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries, they must also decisively defeat Soviet modern revisionism.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has been pursuing a policy of "aid to Vietnam, aid to the U.S." in the Vietnam issue, sabotaging the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. It personally promotes the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" deception, devises strategies for the U.S. imperialists to expand the war in Vietnam, and attempts to force the Vietnamese people to surrender, handing over South Vietnam to U.S. imperialism. At a time when U.S. imperialism is suffering increasing defeats and lacks troops in the Vietnam War, the Soviet revisionist leadership openly facilitates the U.S. imperialists in transferring more invasion troops from Europe to South Vietnam, and sells large quantities of strategic materials—magnesium—to the U.S. imperialists to manufacture weapons of mass murder against the Vietnamese people.

The article emphasizes: The Soviet revisionist leadership has completely betrayed the Vietnamese people and completely sold out the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people.

The article also points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has colluded with the reactionaries of various Asian countries to suppress the national liberation struggles of the Asian peoples and attack the contemporary world revolutionary stronghold—the People's Republic of China. The article states that the Soviet revisionist leadership has strengthened its collusion with the right-wing military clique of Suharto in Indonesia, which has the blood of the Indonesian revolutionary people on its hands, and openly transports weapons to this reactionary clique to brutally massacre the Indonesian people. It also agrees to extend the repayment period for debts owed by the Suharto clique and announces its readiness to invest in Indonesia to stabilize the economy of the Suharto reactionary regime and plunder the wealth of the Indonesian people.

The article states that the Soviet revisionist leadership also provides large-scale military aid to the Indian reactionaries who follow the orders of the United States. It supplies heavy tanks, missiles, MiG-21 fighter jets, helicopters, various warships, and submarines to India, to be used for invading China, threatening Pakistan, and suppressing the patriotic people of India.

The article states that the Soviet revisionist leadership has also decided to establish diplomatic relations with the puppet clique of Rahman, the lackey of U.S. and British imperialism in "Malaysia," shamelessly claiming that it shares the same views as Rahman and openly supporting the reactionary domestic and foreign policies of the Rahman clique.

The article emphasizes that the Soviet revisionist leadership is a traitor to the revolutionary peoples of various countries and a common enemy of the revolutionary peoples of the world. Revolutionary peoples must draw a clear line of demarcation with it and resolutely defeat it.

    “泰国人民之声”说苏修集团是世界革命人民的共同敌人
    革命人民必须坚决打倒苏修
    指出苏修领导集团已成为美帝推行侵略政策的代理人
    新华社十五日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十三日发表文章指出，苏联修正主义领导集团已经成为美帝国主义推行侵略政策的代理人。全世界革命人民在反对美帝国主义和各国反动派的同时，必须坚决打败苏联现代修正主义。
    文章指出，苏修领导集团在越南问题上，一直执行着假援越真援美的政策，破坏越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。它亲自出马为美帝国主义推销“和谈”骗局，为美帝国主义扩大侵越战争出谋献策，妄图迫使越南人民投降，拱手把越南南方送给美帝国主义。正当美帝国主义在侵越战争中日益惨败、兵源缺乏的时候，苏修领导集团公然为美帝国主义从欧洲抽调更多的侵略军到南越提供方便，并把大批战略物资——镁卖给美帝国主义，制造杀人武器去屠杀越南人民。
    文章强调指出：苏修领导集团已经彻底地背叛了越南人民，彻底地出卖了越南人民的革命利益。
    文章还指出，苏修领导集团还纠集亚洲各国的反动派，镇压亚洲人民的民族解放斗争，攻击当代世界革命堡垒——中华人民共和国。文章说，苏修领导集团加强同双手沾满印尼革命人民鲜血的印尼苏哈托右派军人集团的勾结，公开运送武器给这个反动集团野蛮屠杀印尼人民。它还同意苏哈托集团延期偿还所欠债务，并宣布准备到印尼投资，以稳定苏哈托反动政权的经济，并掠夺印尼人民的财富。
    文章说，苏修领导集团对唯美国意旨是从的印度反动派也给予大量军事援助。它把重型坦克、导弹、米格二十一型战斗机、直升飞机、各种战舰和潜水艇等供给印度，用来侵略中国、威胁巴基斯坦和镇压印度爱国人民。
    文章说，苏修领导集团还决定同美、英帝国主义的走狗“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团建立外交关系，恬不知耻地宣称它同拉赫曼的“观点一致”，公开支持拉赫曼集团的对内对外反动政策。
    文章着重指出，苏修领导集团是各国革命人民的叛徒，是全世界革命人民的共同敌人。革命人民必须同它划清界限，坚决打败它。
