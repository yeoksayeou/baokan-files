Marching Forward Along the Bright Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

Together with the revolutionary masses across the country, concentrate firepower to criticize the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, further do a good job in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and in the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, promote ideological revolutionization, and turn the army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

New China News Agency, May 6th: On the eve of the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's directive that the People's Liberation Army should be a big school, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force, with boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, reviewed this directive of great historical and strategic significance, and recalled the tremendous achievements made in the past year in implementing this directive. The soldiers and officers unanimously declared that in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they will, together with the revolutionary masses across the country, actively participate in criticizing the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, do a good job in supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, and in the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, further promote ideological revolutionization, and turn the army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent days, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of various military branches and services have held discussions and meetings in camps, docks, airports, factories, farms, and fishing grounds, and on the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, to review the situation of studying and implementing this directive over the past year and to share their gains and experiences. Many unit leaders have also gone deep into the companies to summarize experiences and guide the companies to better implement this directive. Some units, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and beating drums, went to nearby areas to propagate and study with the revolutionary masses of factories and villages. The General Logistics Department, Navy, Air Force, and the troops stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, and Shandong also held grand meetings to celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's great directive.

Over the past year, the various units of the People's Liberation Army have implemented Chairman Mao's great directive that the army should be a big school, and have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of soldiers and officers have gone out of the barracks to class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and widely propagated Mao Zedong Thought among the people. Especially at the critical moment when the Cultural Revolution entered the stage of revolutionary factions uniting to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, many units responded to Chairman Mao's call, rushed to the front lines of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, effectively promoted the great alliance of revolutionary factions and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, struck at the class enemies, strengthened military-civilian relations, and greatly tempered and raised the political and ideological level of the broad masses of soldiers and officers, further promoting the extremely proletarian and extremely combat-ready nature of the army.

These soldiers and officers tempered in the storms of class struggle, with hearts filled with excitement, talked about their growth over the past year under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant directive. Soldiers of a reconnaissance company of a unit in the Shenyang Military Region, at a recent "Reporting to Chairman Mao on the Harvest of the Big School" meeting, introduced their gains and experiences in supporting the left. They said, "Our big school is set up in the great winds and waves of class struggle. Our teachers are the broad masses of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary youngsters, and revolutionary cadres. Our textbooks are the shining works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's call to establish a revolutionary big school is a fundamental measure to ensure that our Party and army will never change color and will always be revolutionary, and is a heavy and resolute blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and attempting to restore capitalism. We are determined to temper ourselves in this revolutionary big school into good soldiers who will always uphold Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!"

The "Model Eighth Company on Nanjing Road" has, over the past year, participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with great enthusiasm, from cities to villages, from barracks to the masses. They said, "What we learn in the classroom of class struggle is the most solid, and the soldiers who graduate from it can stand the test, only in this way can we truly ensure that we can withstand the great winds and waves and never change color." Some leading cadres of the Beijing Military Region, after reviewing the situation of the army's revolutionary construction over the past year, excitedly pointed out that due to the implementation of Chairman Mao's great directive, the army's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works have reached a new level, and ideological construction has made a leap forward. They said, "Factories, villages, and schools are the best classrooms for ideological tempering. Studying Chairman Mao's works there is lively, applicable, effective, and can best accelerate the ideological revolutionization of soldiers and officers."

After summarizing and reviewing the great achievements of implementing Chairman Mao's directive, the broad masses of soldiers and officers have a deeper understanding of the great significance of turning the People's Liberation Army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. The air force unit that shot down five U.S. aggressor planes in eight days unanimously believed that turning our army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought is a fundamental measure to strengthen war preparedness, fully unleash the great power of people's war, ensure that our country can defeat the enemy in any situation, and always stand unyielding; it is a fundamental measure to gradually eliminate the three differences in our country, prevent revisionism, achieve ideological revolutionization, build socialism, and transition to communism. The soldiers and officers of a unit of the Nanjing Military Region, who completed the task of enclosing lakes to create farmland 136,000 mu ahead of schedule, said, "We have tempered ourselves in hard labor by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and feel more connected with the laboring people at heart. We must ensure that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color and resolutely march forward along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao." (with photo)

The cadres and soldiers of the direct-affiliated organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force solemnly held a meeting to warmly celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's May 7th directive, and vowed to further strive to turn the army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.
