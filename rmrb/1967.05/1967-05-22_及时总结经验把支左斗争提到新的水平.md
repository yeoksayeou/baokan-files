Chairman Mao has directed our military to support the local proletarian cultural revolution and to strongly support the leftists. This is a great and strategically significant decision, a new historical task. Following Chairman Mao's wise decision, our military's broad ranks of soldiers and officers have taken up a fighting stance, rushed to the front lines of this great class struggle, and provided powerful support to the broad masses of leftists with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, achieving significant victories.

The new historical task of the proletarian cultural revolution has posed many new problems for us. As long as we actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, these new problems can be solved. Through the previous phase of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training struggles, we have already gained quite rich experiences. We must use the intervals between battles to summarize these experiences well, promote achievements, correct mistakes, and strive for new and greater victories.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We need to summarize the main experiences in our work, including successful experiences and erroneous experiences, so that beneficial experiences can be promoted and lessons can be learned from erroneous experiences." When we summarize the experiences of supporting the left struggle, we feel especially close to this teaching of Chairman Mao.

The supporting the left cadres of the Guangzhou garrison have done a relatively good job in summarizing the experiences of supporting the left struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings.

The experiences of the Guangzhou garrison tell us: Taking the struggle between the two lines as the key, and prominently solving the problem of correctly treating the masses, is a very correct policy. The myriad problems encountered in supporting the left struggle ultimately boil down to the struggle between the two lines and the problem of how to correctly treat the masses. As long as we firmly grasp the key issue of the struggle between the two lines and the problem of how to correctly treat the masses, we grasp the essence, making it easier to distinguish right from wrong and to differentiate between the main and secondary aspects; many specific problems and vague understandings can be resolved. Otherwise, if we lose sight of the main issue, not only will specific problems be difficult to solve, but our understanding will also become more confused. In the process of summarizing the experiences of supporting the left, the Guangzhou garrison has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, exposed and criticized the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, deepened their understanding of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and recognized that how to treat the masses is a dividing line between the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line, thereby greatly enhancing their consciousness in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The experiences of the Guangzhou garrison also tell us: Mobilizing the masses to summarize experiences and lessons is an effective method for the masses to educate themselves. The broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the supporting the left troops have been on the front lines of class struggle, feeling the problems encountered in the struggle most deeply and having the most sensory knowledge in various aspects. The problems they raise should be discussed by everyone, and collective wisdom should be used to solve them. In this way, the impact on everyone's thoughts is the greatest, and problems are solved the fastest. Otherwise, if we merely place our hopes on the leadership, asking the leadership for information, methods, and conclusions, without everyone's serious consideration and thorough discussion, it is impossible to truly solve problems. In the process of summarizing experiences, the Guangzhou garrison has fully utilized the method of mass self-education, not only smoothly solving a series of problems raised by the cadres themselves, but also providing a very practical and vivid education on the mass line for the cadres.

The experiences of the Guangzhou garrison also tell us: Organizing the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works in response to the living thoughts of cadres and soldiers is the fundamental way to strengthen the ideological revolutionization of the supporting the left troops. Sharp and complex class struggles inevitably cause various reflections in the minds of the soldiers and officers of the supporting the left troops. Using the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought to solve various real-life ideological problems has the greatest power and the fastest effect. We learn Mao Zedong Thought only through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the workers and peasants. We must use Mao Zedong Thought, this most sharp ideological weapon, to analyze the various problems we encounter in practical struggles, and use Mao Zedong Thought as the red thread to connect the insights we gain from actual struggles. In this way, we will definitely promote the ideological revolutionization of our troops to a new level, thereby greatly enhancing our level of supporting the left struggle.

At this crucial moment of the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, it is urgent for the supporting the left troops to seize the intervals between battles to summarize experiences in time. Let us, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, like conducting frontline training during wartime, through summarizing experiences, further arouse the great fearless spirit of the proletarian revolution, raise the level of supporting the left work to a new level, and better accomplish the glorious task entrusted to us by Chairman Mao.

### 及时总结经验把支左斗争提到新的水平

    及时总结经验把支左斗争提到新的水平
    毛主席指示我军支援地方无产阶级文化大革命，大力支持左派。这是一个伟大的、具有战略意义的决定，是一个崭新的历史任务。遵循毛主席的这个英明决策，我军广大指战员以战斗的姿态，奔赴这场阶级大搏斗的第一线，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想给予左派广大群众以有力的支援，取得了重大的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命这个崭新的历史任务向我们提出了许多新问题，这些新问题，只要我们在实践中活学活用毛主席著作，就能得到解决。经过前一段支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的斗争实践，我们已经取得了相当丰富的经验。我们要利用战斗的间隙，及时把经验好好总结一下，发扬成绩，纠正错误，以争取新的更大的胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“需要把我们工作中的主要经验，包括成功的经验和错误的经验，加以总结，使那些有益的经验得到推广，而从那些错误的经验中取得教训。”在我们总结支左斗争经验的时候，重温毛主席的这一教导，特别感到亲切。
    广州驻军支左干部按照毛主席的教导，及时总结支左斗争的经验，是做得比较好的。
    广州驻军的经验告诉我们：以两条路线斗争为纲，突出解决正确对待群众的问题，是一个非常正确的方针。支左斗争中碰到的千头万绪的问题，归根到底是两条路线斗争的问题，如何正确对待群众的问题。只要紧紧抓住两条路线斗争的纲，紧紧抓住如何正确对待群众这个关键问题，就抓住了根本，就容易辨明是非，分清主流和支流；许多具体问题和模糊认识就能迎刃而解。不然，舍本逐末，不仅具体问题难解决，认识也会越弄越糊涂。广州驻军在总结支左经验的过程中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，揭发、批判了资产阶级反动路线的罪行，加深了对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的理解，认识到如何对待群众，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的一个分水岭，从而大大提高了执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的自觉性。
    广州驻军的经验又告诉我们：发动群众，总结经验教训，是群众自己教育自己的一个有效的方法。支左部队的广大指战员投入阶级斗争的第一线，对斗争中碰到的问题感受最深，各方面的感性知识最多。把他们摆出来的问题，交给大家去讨论，运用集体的智慧去解决，这样，对大家的思想触动最大，问题解决得最快。不然，仅仅把希望寄托在领导身上，向领导伸手要情况，要办法，要结论，而不经过大家认真思考和充分讨论，是不可能真正解决问题的。广州驻军在总结经验的过程中，充分地运用了群众性自我教育的方法，不仅顺利地解决了干部自己提出的一系列问题，而且也是对干部的一次最实际、最生动的群众路线的教育。
    广州驻军的经验还告诉我们：针对干部战士的活思想，组织活学活用毛主席著作，是加强支左部队思想革命化建设的根本的根本。尖锐复杂的阶级斗争必然在支左部队指战员的头脑中引起各种各样的反映。用光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想去解决各种现实思想问题，威力最大，收效最快。我们学习毛泽东思想，只有通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。要运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的思想武器，将我们在斗争实践中遇到的各种问题加以剖解，运用毛泽东思想这根红线，将我们在实际斗争中取得的心得体会贯串起来，这样，就一定会促使我们部队的思想革命化建设达到一个新的高度，从而大大提高我们支左斗争的水平。
    在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，支左部队抓紧战斗间隙，及时总结经验，实为斗争形势所急需。让我们在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，象战争年代进行火线练兵那样，通过总结经验，更加奋发无产阶级革命的大无畏精神，把支左工作提高到新的水平，更好地完成毛主席交给我们的光荣任务。　　　　　　（五月二十一日）
