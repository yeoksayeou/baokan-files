	Many African students affectionately refer to "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as the Little Red Book, and they all hope to obtain a copy. One day, a student finally got a copy of the much-desired "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but before he could read it, a friend borrowed it the same day. That friend read it until late at night and then immediately returned it. Another two students shared a single copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," both wanting to carry it with them to read more. To resolve this conflict, they agreed to take turns carrying it.

	One student who frequently studies Chairman Mao's works said: "I will study Mao Zedong's works for a lifetime. I will encourage my family and friends to study Mao Zedong's works as well. Chairman Mao understands Africa the best. His essay 'Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society' is as if it were written for us Africans."

    一辈子学习毛主席著作
    许多非洲学生非常亲切地把《毛主席语录》称为红书，都渴望能得到一本。有一天，有一位学生得到了一本渴望已久的宝书《毛主席语录》，自己还来不及阅读，当天就被一位朋友借走了。那位朋友一直阅读到深夜，读完后就立即归还给他。另外有两位学生共有一本《毛主席语录》，都想带在身边多读一读。为了解决这个矛盾，他们二人达成一项协议：轮流带着读。
    有一位经常学习毛主席著作的学生说：“我要一辈子学习毛泽东著作。我要叫我家里的人、我的朋友们都来学习毛泽东著作。毛主席最了解我们非洲，他写的《中国社会各阶级的分析》一文，就象为我们非洲写的。”
