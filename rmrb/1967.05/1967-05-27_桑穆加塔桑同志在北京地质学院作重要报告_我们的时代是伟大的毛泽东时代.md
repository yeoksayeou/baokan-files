Comrade Samarasinghe Delivers Important Speech at Beijing Institute of Geology
Our Era is the Great Era of Mao Zedong

Comrade Samarasinghe, a member of the Central Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ceylon, today delivered an important speech to nearly 5,000 revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards at the Beijing Institute of Geology. In his speech, he enthusiastically praised Comrade Mao Zedong as the greatest teacher, the greatest leader, and the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He said that Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new and higher stage. He pointed out, "Today, anyone who attacks Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally attacking Marxism-Leninism. Today, the touchstone of a Marxist is his attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought."

Comrade Samarasinghe was invited by the "East is Red" Commune Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Institute of Geology to deliver this speech. He said in his speech, "We live in an era that is rightly called the Mao Zedong Era. In this era, Mao Zedong Thought illuminates and guides the path for all revolutionaries. This is also an era where world imperialism is approaching its doom, and world socialism is marching towards victory. It is a great joy and honor for all of us to live in such an era."

Comrade Samarasinghe said, "Beijing is the center of world revolution, the heart of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the place where our beloved Chairman Mao resides. The brilliant leader Mao Zedong, standing at the forefront of the international communist movement, has creatively developed Marxism-Leninism to new heights. This is not only a great fortune for the Chinese people but also a great fortune for the people of the world."

In his speech, Comrade Samarasinghe enthusiastically praised our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has already achieved decisive victories, will be recorded in history as the greatest and epoch-making event in the world. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, with his rare genius and foresight, solved many problems that had not been solved before, thereby greatly enriching the vast treasury of Marxism-Leninism."

Comrade Samarasinghe said, "Marx and Engels discovered the eternal truths of scientific socialism. Lenin applied their teachings to lead the world's first socialist revolution to victory. His closest comrade-in-arms, Stalin, consolidated this victory, established socialism for the first time in the world, and defended it against attacks by imperialism and fascism. Comrade Mao Zedong further told us how to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, how to achieve the transformation of people's ideology to adapt to the socialist economic base, thereby ensuring the prevention of capitalist restoration; while this disaster of capitalist restoration has already occurred in the first country to achieve socialist victory. In light of the unfortunate events that have taken place in the homeland of Lenin and Stalin, we can better appreciate the greatness of Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings." He pointed out that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is not only a matter concerning the Chinese people but also a major matter concerning the people of the whole world. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, by ensuring the prevention of capitalist restoration in China, has defended the base of world revolution. Therefore, it has ensured the ultimate defeat of world imperialism and the victory of socialism worldwide. It has dealt a heavy blow to modern revisionism and brought new life and new leadership to the international communist movement. For this reason, imperialists, various reactionaries, and modern revisionists have joined forces to form a criminal alliance against China and its Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Samarasinghe said, "Comrade Mao Zedong teaches us that 'being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing.' Therefore, if imperialists, various reactionaries, and modern revisionists attack and slander the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must be a good thing. He said, imperialists and modern revisionists attempt to isolate China, but through the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China has become even closer to the broad masses of the world."

Comrade Samarasinghe said, "Now, because the modern revisionists, with the Soviet revisionist leadership at their center, have shamefully betrayed the revolutionary cause of Marxism-Leninism, the correct and revolutionary leadership of the Communist Party of China and its great leader, Chairman Mao, is even more important to the international communist movement."

He said, if we are to successfully complete the task of world revolution victory, true revolutionaries have the duty to struggle against the classes and forces that attempt to achieve peaceful evolution into capitalism and to purge their poison from the international communist movement. As Lenin and Chairman Mao have taught us, revisionism is a bourgeois ideology within the workers' movement and is today the main danger in the international communist movement.

Comrade Samarasinghe pointed out that modern revisionism "has degenerated into a despicable tool of world imperialism. This is the last reserve army that imperialism has found in the workers' movement, the last force supporting its shaky rule." "It must be recognized that without simultaneously waging a struggle against modern revisionism, it is impossible to wage a struggle against imperialism."

Comrade Samarasinghe pointed out that the Soviet modern revisionist group is the greatest traitor in history. They have distorted and betrayed Marxism-Leninism and everything advocated by Lenin and Stalin; they have followed the example of the Yugoslav Tito clique, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and have already taken decisive steps to lead the Soviet Union down the road to capitalist restoration; they have damaged and split the revolutionary unity of the international communist movement and, together with imperialism and all reactionaries, have slandered revolutionary China and Albania; they have betrayed the national liberation movements of various regions of the world and aided the reactionaries of the world. "In short, the Soviet modern revisionist group has become the chief accomplice of the worst imperialist bandits in the world."

He said, the struggle against world imperialism and the struggle against modern revisionism are inseparable and are parts of the same process. Whoever does not struggle against modern revisionism will, at some stage, stop struggling against world imperialism. For this reason, the theory of neutrality or a middle road between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism is completely wrong and should be resolutely condemned. There is no such middle road. One is either a Marxist-Leninist or a modern revisionist. There can be no compromise between the two.

Comrade Samarasinghe, in his speech, introduced the struggles and victories of the Ceylonese people under the leadership of the Ceylonese working class and the Communist Party against American and British imperialism, feudalism, and the comprador bourgeoisie, as well as against modern revisionism. He said, "We are full of confidence in the future. In this regard, we are inspired by the fact that we have received the precious guidance of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

Comrade Samarasinghe said, "Our party fully and unreservedly agrees with the evaluation made by the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China at its Eleventh Plenary Session, that 'Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new and higher stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory.'"

Comrade Samarasinghe pointed out that today, the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone of true and false Marxists. He said, "In Lenin's time, whoever attacked Leninism was fundamentally attacking Marxism; today, whoever attacks Mao Zedong Thought is fundamentally attacking Marxism-Leninism. Just as in the days after the victory of the October Revolution, the touchstone of a Marxist was his attitude towards the Soviet Union; today, the touchstone of a Marxist is his attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. It is also the dividing line between revolutionaries and reformists, between Marxist-Leninists and modern revisionists."

Comrade Samarasinghe said, "Under the inspiration and guidance of Mao Zedong's revolutionary thought, we will resolutely build a revolutionary party in Ceylon, which will lead the Ceylonese revolutionary movement to victory and make our contribution to the realization of socialism in the world."

In concluding his speech, Comrade Samarasinghe shouted, "Long live the revolutionary friendship between the working classes and peoples of China and Ceylon! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live proletarian internationalism!"

Comrade Samarasinghe's speech was met with thunderous applause throughout the hall. During the meeting, the hall repeatedly shouted, "Workers of the world, unite! Down with American imperialism, down with Soviet revisionism, down with all reactionaries! Long live the fighting friendship between the two parties of China and Ceylon! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Comrade Samarasinghe and his wife and daughter, accompanied by the alternate member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Zhao Yimin, arrived at the Beijing Institute of Geology this morning and were warmly welcomed by thousands of revolutionary teachers and students.

At the beginning of the meeting, the entire hall stood and sang the "Internationale" and read quotations from Chairman Mao. Revolutionary youngsters from the "East is Red" Commune of the Beijing Institute of Geology presented "Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought" armbands and Mao badges with the inscription "Beijing Institute of Geology 'East is Red' Commune" to Comrade Samarasinghe and his wife and daughter.

Comrade Wang Dabin, the head of the "East is Red" Commune Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Institute of Geology, delivered a welcome speech. He said, we are extremely excited to welcome Comrade Samarasinghe, the messenger from the front lines of the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, from the Communist Party of Ceylon and the people of Ceylon.

He said, the Chinese proletarian revolutionaries are determined to be a strong backbone for the Ceylonese proletarian revolutionaries, to be a strong backbone for the proletarian revolutionaries of all countries in the world, and to forever stand together with the proletarian revolutionaries of the world, fight together, and win together, to overthrow American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, to liberate all mankind, and to struggle for the establishment of a new world shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. At the end of the meeting, the entire hall sang "The East is Red."

    桑穆加塔桑同志在北京地质学院作重要报告
    我们的时代是伟大的毛泽东时代
    毛主席把马列主义创造性地发展到新的高峰。对待毛泽东思想的态度，是区别马列主义者还是修正主义者的分界线。中国文化大革命为国际共运带来了新的生命，保证了社会主义在全世界的胜利。苏修集团是历史上最大的叛徒，反帝和反修斗争不可分割。在马列主义和现代修正主义之间没有中间道路。
    新华社二十六日讯  锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、书记处书记桑穆加塔桑同志，今天在访问北京地质学院时，向北京地质学院近五千名革命师生和红卫兵小将作了长篇重要报告。他在报告中热烈赞扬毛泽东同志是最伟大的导师，最伟大的领袖，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。他说，毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。他指出，“在今天，谁如果攻击毛泽东思想，谁就是在根本上攻击马克思列宁主义。”“在今天，一个马克思主义者的试金石就是看他对毛泽东思想所抱的态度。”
    桑穆加塔桑同志是应北京地质学院“东方红”公社革命委员会邀请前往作报告的。他在报告中说，“我们生活的时代被正确地称为毛泽东时代。在这个时代里，毛泽东思想照亮和指明了所有革命者的道路，这个时代也是世界帝国主义接近灭亡，世界社会主义走向胜利的时代。我们大家能生活在这样的时代，真是愉快和荣幸。”
    桑穆加塔桑同志说，北京是世界革命的中心，是无产阶级文化大革命的心脏，是我们敬爱的毛主席居住的地方。具有卓越天才的毛泽东同志，站在国际共产主义运动的前头，把马克思列宁主义创造性地发展到新的高峰，这不仅是中国人民的莫大幸运，也是世界人民的莫大幸运。
    桑穆加塔桑同志在讲话中热烈赞扬我国的无产阶级文化大革命。他说：“现在已经取得了决定性胜利的无产阶级文化大革命，将成为世界上最伟大的具有划时代意义的事件而载入史册。在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛泽东同志以少有的天才和预见性，解决了许多过去所没有解决的问题，从而大大地丰富了马克思列宁主义的巨大宝库。”
    桑穆加塔桑同志说：“马克思和恩格斯发现了科学社会主义的永恒真理。列宁运用他们的学说，领导世界上第一个社会主义革命取得了胜利。他的最亲密战友斯大林，巩固了这个胜利，在世界上第一次建立了社会主义，并在遭到帝国主义和法西斯进攻时捍卫了它。毛泽东同志进而告诉我们如何巩固无产阶级专政，如何实现人的思想改造来适应社会主义经济基础，从而确保防止资本主义复辟；而资本主义复辟这个灾难已经在第一个取得社会主义胜利的国家里发生了。联系到列宁和斯大林的故乡所发生的不幸事件来看，就使我们更加体会到毛泽东同志的学说的伟大。”他指出，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，不仅仅是关系到中国人民的事情，而且也是关系到全世界人民的重大事情。无产阶级文化大革命，由于保证了防止资本主义在中国复辟，因而保卫了世界革命的根据地。所以，它保证了最终打败世界帝国主义和社会主义在世界范围内取得胜利。它沉重地打击了现代修正主义，为国际共产主义运动带来了新的生命和新的领导。正因为这样，帝国主义者，形形色色的反动派以及现代修正主义者，勾结起来，结成罪恶的同盟来反对中国和中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    桑穆加塔桑同志说，毛泽东同志教导我们，“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事”。因此，如果帝国主义者、形形色色的反动派和现代修正主义者攻击和诬蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命，无产阶级文化大革命就必然是件好事。他说，帝国主义、现代修正主义企图孤立中国，然而通过伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，中国已经同全世界的广大群众更加接近了。
    桑穆加塔桑说：“现在，由于以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者可耻地背叛马克思列宁主义的革命事业，所以中国共产党及其伟大的领袖毛泽东主席对国际共产主义运动的正确的和革命的领导就更为重要了。”
    他说，如果我们要成功地完成世界革命胜利的任务，真正的革命者，就有义务同企图实现和平演变为资本主义的阶级和力量进行斗争，肃清它们在国际共产主义运动中的毒害。正如列宁和毛主席教导我们的，修正主义是工人运动内部的一种资产阶级思潮，是今天国际共产主义运动中的主要危险。
    桑穆加塔桑指出，现代修正主义“已经堕落成为世界帝国主义卑鄙的工具。这是世界帝国主义在工人运动中找到的最后的后备军，是支撑它摇摇欲坠的统治的最后力量。”“必须认识到，不同时开展对现代修正主义的斗争，就不能开展对帝国主义的斗争。”
    桑穆加塔桑指出，苏联现代修正主义集团是历史上最大的叛徒。他们歪曲和背叛了马克思列宁主义及列宁和斯大林主张的一切事情；他们追随南斯拉夫铁托集团的榜样，把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政，并且已经采取一些决定性的步骤，把苏联引向资本主义复辟的道路；他们损害和分裂了国际共产主义运动的革命团结，和帝国主义和一切反动派一起诽谤革命的中国和阿尔巴尼亚；他们背叛了世界各地区的民族解放运动，帮助了世界上的反动派。“总之，苏联现代修正主义集团已经成为世界上最坏的帝国主义强盗的头号帮凶。”
    他说，反对世界帝国主义和反对现代修正主义是不可分割的，是同一进程的组成部分。谁不反对现代修正主义，他就将在这个或那个阶段停止反对世界帝国主义的斗争。正因为这样，所以在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间提出中立或中间道路的理论是完全错误的，应当受到坚决的谴责。根本不存在这样的中间道路。要么是一个马克思列宁主义者，要么是一个现代修正主义者。在这两者之间是不可能妥协的。
    桑穆加塔桑在报告中介绍了锡兰人民在锡兰工人阶级和共产党领导下，反对美英帝国主义、封建主义和官僚买办资产阶级，以及反对现代修正主义的斗争和所取得的胜利。他说，“我们对未来充满信心。在这方面，我们得到的鼓舞是由于我们得到了当代的马克思列宁主义、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的宝贵指导。”
    桑穆加塔桑说，“我们党完全地、毫无保留地赞同中国共产党第八届中央委员会第十一次全体会议所作的评价，即：‘毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。’”
    桑穆加塔桑指出，在今天，对毛泽东思想的态度，就是真假马克思主义者的试金石。他说，“在列宁的时代，谁如果攻击列宁主义，谁就是在根本上攻击马克思主义；在今天，谁如果攻击毛泽东思想，谁也就是在根本上攻击马克思列宁主义。这正如在十月革命胜利后的日子里，一个马克思主义者的试金石是看他对苏联抱的态度；而今天，一个马克思主义者的试金石是看他对毛泽东思想所抱的态度。它也是区别革命者还是改良主义者，是马克思列宁主义者还是现代修正主义分子的分界线。”
    桑穆加塔桑说，“在毛泽东革命思想的鼓舞和指导下，我们坚决要在锡兰建设起一个革命党，这个党将领导锡兰的革命运动达到胜利，从而为在全世界实现社会主义作出我们的贡献。”
    桑穆加塔桑在结束讲话时高呼：“锡中两国工人阶级和两国人民的革命友谊万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛泽东同志万岁！”“无产阶级国际主义万岁！”
    桑穆加塔桑同志的报告，在全场激起了一阵阵雷鸣般的热烈掌声。大会进行过程中，全场一次又一次地高呼：“全世界无产者联合起来！”“打倒美帝、打倒苏修、打倒一切反动派！”“中锡两党的战斗友谊万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    桑穆加塔桑同志和夫人及女儿，今天上午在中共中央候补委员赵毅敏同志陪同下来到北京地质学院时，受到数千名革命师生热烈的夹道欢迎。
    报告大会开始时，全场起立高唱《国际歌》，并朗读毛主席语录。北京地质学院“东方红”公社的革命小将把“毛泽东思想红卫兵”袖章，和写有北京地质学院“东方红”公社字样的毛主席像章，赠献给桑穆加塔桑同志和他的夫人及女儿。
    北京地质学院“东方红”公社革命委员会主任王大宾致欢迎词。他说，我们今天怀着万分兴奋的心情欢迎来自反帝反修斗争前线的锡兰共产党和锡兰人民的使者桑穆加塔桑同志。
    他说，中国的无产阶级革命派誓做锡兰无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，誓做世界各国无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，永远同全世界无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，为打倒美帝国主义，打倒苏联现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为解放全人类，为建立一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新世界而奋斗。报告大会结束时，全场高唱《东方红》。
