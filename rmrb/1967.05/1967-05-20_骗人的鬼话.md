"The idea that 'in front of truth, all are equal' is a complete lie!

Peng Zhen and his ilk have allowed demons and monsters to run wild, filling newspapers and stages with poisonous weeds, while suppressing the proletarian left's active study and application of Chairman Mao's works with the big stick of 'vulgarization' and 'simplification.' This is what they call equality!

The 'Report Outline' labels the proletarian left as 'academic despots,' shouting that they need to be 'rectified,' while protecting real bourgeois academic despots like Wu Han. This is what they call equality!

The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party have implemented white terror during the Cultural Revolution, labeling revolutionary masses as 'counter-revolutionaries,' 'anti-Party elements,' and 'fake leftists, real rightists,' while protecting a handful of real counter-revolutionaries. This is what they call equality!

Let this bourgeois trick of 'in front of truth, all are equal' go to hell!

    骗人的鬼话
    “在真理面前人人平等”，完全是骗人的鬼话！
    彭真之流放手让牛鬼蛇神出笼，让毒草充满报刊和舞台，而对工农兵活学活用毛主席著作这枝香花，却用“庸俗化”、“简单化”的大棒，一棍子打死。这是什么平等！
    《汇报提纲》把“学阀”的帽子，强加在无产阶级左派头上，叫嚣要对
  “坚定的左派”进行“整风”，而对真正的资产阶级学阀吴晗之流，却百般包庇，爱护备至。这又是什么平等！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在文化大革命中实行白色恐怖，把革命群众打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“假左派真右派”，而保护他们一小撮真正的反革命。这又是什么平等！
    让“在真理面前人人平等”这个资产阶级的骗人花招见鬼去吧！
