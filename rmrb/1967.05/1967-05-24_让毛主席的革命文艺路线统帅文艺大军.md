Revolutionary comrades! Comrades of the revolutionary proletariat:

First of all, let us wish our most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Let us wish Vice Chairman Lin good health! Eternal health!

Chairman Mao's epoch-making brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," has been published for twenty-five years. Twenty-five years ago, Chairman Mao formulated a complete set of proletarian revolutionary literary lines in the "Talks." Why, after liberation, over the course of more than a decade, were these lines not implemented but instead distorted and altered? For no other reason than that our ranks have been infiltrated by "ghosts"! Because there is a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line that has seized our power. Where are the "ghosts"? Who is the head of this black line? This great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has completely exposed this cover, has dug out this "ghost" who is the head of the black line in the literary world, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road! This is a tremendous joy! We must press on with our victory, thoroughly eliminate this literary black line, uproot the source of this literary black line, and criticize the crimes committed by this Chinese Khrushchev in the literary world, allowing Chairman Mao's boundless revolutionary literary line to lead the entire literary army, and let every word and sentence of the "Talks" be imprinted in the minds of revolutionary literary workers and carried out in actual actions.

Literature and art, as an important part of the superstructure, have always been in the hands of the exploiting classes, used to consolidate their reactionary rule. It was our great leader Chairman Mao who first clearly stated in the "Talks": "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for them to use." The "Talks" have the most distinct class character. The "Talks" solve the series of problems regarding for whom literature and art are for, from the long-term interests of the proletariat and from the root. We believe that for literary workers themselves, to solve the problem of for whom, they must solve the problem of for whom they are. Chairman Mao calls on us to be the "ox" of the proletariat and the people, to devote ourselves wholeheartedly and to the end. Staying in big cities, holding on to "foreign, famous, and ancient" things all day, one cannot become the "ox" of the proletariat. One must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time, thoroughly change one's worldview, and shift one's standpoint to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we become revolutionary fighters who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's literary line.

To shift one's standpoint, one must go to the fiery struggle, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to create literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time. Otherwise, the soul of the literary worker will not be touched. I have hesitated and taken many detours on the issue of going deep into the troops. In the troops, everything can touch my soul. Once, two soldiers in the platoon had a cold. That night, it snowed, and it was very cold. I slept for a long time, and my two feet were still cold, so cold that I couldn't sleep. The political instructor came to check the beds and covered one of the sick soldiers with his coat. It seems that covering him with a coat would make the soldier warmer and more comfortable. But he kept turning and couldn't sleep. Until he quietly got up and covered the other sick comrade with the coat, he then slept peacefully. Why? Because he is a soldier armed with Mao Zedong Thought, selfless and dedicated to others, truly putting the concern for others above self-concern. Different standpoints make the concepts of cold and warm, comfortable and uncomfortable different. In his mind, only when his comrade is warm does he feel warm; only when his comrade is comfortable does he feel comfortable. Sleeping next to this soldier, I felt my soul was touched, I had a deeper understanding of our soldiers, and I saw myself more clearly.

Our era is one where Mao Zedong Thought is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the "Three Articles" shine brightly in the minds of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Everywhere there are the most noble, purest, most moral, most detached from vulgar interests, and most beneficial to the people heroes of the workers and peasants. The question is, you must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time, you must shift your standpoint, and you must undergo a thorough ideological transformation. Otherwise, you cannot understand the new people armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

However, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, and the counter-revolutionary revisionist gang led by Zhou Yang, distorted and attacked the "Talks," and did everything they could to tie literary workers to the words "fame" and "profit," locking them in big cities, not allowing them to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, making it impossible for us to shift our standpoint to the side of the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev openly said, "One can go to the countryside in a car," "eat and sleep in the car." In desperate situations, he also said a few words about going to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but it was not to learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, not to change one's ideology, but for what "in the broad masses' revolutionary struggle to temper and develop one's individuality and characteristics." Enough! If we follow his method, when will our standpoint shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers? If we follow this path, the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers will be usurped, literary workers will rot, and the audience and readers will be poisoned, and his dream of capitalist restoration will come true.

No! The white daydream of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road will never be allowed to come true.

It is time! It is time to thoroughly uproot this literary black line! If literary workers do not propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought but create public opinion for capitalist restoration, what does the Party need this literary army for? If literary workers do not consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, do not serve proletarian politics, what does the Party need this literary army for? Thoroughly smash this literary black line! Knock it down to the ground and make it never rise again! And replace it with Chairman Mao's boundless revolutionary literary line!

We are full of confidence in the victory of establishing a truly proletarian new literature and art, truly for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Through twenty-five years of struggle, the "Talks" have shown its unparalleled greatness. As long as we firmly follow the direction indicated by the "Talks" and firmly act according to the "Talks," we will be invincible.

We are full of pride in establishing a truly proletarian literature and art. Because at the forefront of our ranks is Comrade Jiang Qing, the most loyal executor of the "Talks" and the most resolute fighter against the literary black line. Comrade Jiang Qing has repeatedly instructed us not to mention her in our articles and speeches. But we cannot help but speak.

"Dark clouds press on the city, the city is about to collapse," at the time when the counter-revolutionary revisionist gang led by Zhou Yang was at its peak, who led the revolutionary leftists on the literary front to open a breakthrough for truly proletarian literature and art? Who opened up a piece of proletarian literary battlefield blooming with eight fresh flowers in the thorny wilderness? It was Comrade Jiang Qing! The appearance of revolutionary model operas is the victory of Chairman Mao's literary line, the victory of the "Talks"! It vividly tells us: as long as we act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we can create unprecedented, brilliant, truly proletarian literature and art. It makes the literature and art that the "feudal," "bourgeois," and "revisionist" have been doing for hundreds and thousands of years pale in comparison! Feudal culture has long been declining, bourgeois culture is already rotten, and revisionist goods are also despised by the revolutionary people of the world. The great Mao Zedong Thought, like a red sun rising from the east, its dazzling light illuminates the forward path of world revolutionary literature and art, and is pushing the revolutionary people of the world towards victory!

We must study the "Talks" as our motto, study it for life, and use it for life. On this day of commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of the "Talks," let us shout together:

Long live the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"!

Go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time!

Overthrow the biggest clique within the Party who are taking the capitalist road!

Thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line of the Zhou Yang gang!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao!

    让毛主席的革命文艺路线统帅文艺大军
    金敬迈同志在首都纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会上的讲话革命的同志们！无产阶级革命派的战友们：
    首先让我们敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！敬祝林副主席身体健康！永远健康！
    毛主席的划时代的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年了。二十五年前，毛主席在《讲话》中制定的一整套无产阶级革命文艺路线，为什么在解放后的十几年中，非但没有得到贯彻执行，反而被歪曲篡改了呢？不为别的，因为我们的队伍当中混进了“鬼”！因为有一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线专了我们的政。“鬼”在哪里？黑线的总头头是谁？这次由伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，才把这个盖子彻底揭开，把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派、文艺界黑线的总头头这个“鬼”揪了出来！这是一件天大的喜事！我们一定要乘胜追击，彻底铲除这条文艺黑线，挖掉这条文艺黑线的根子，批臭这个中国的赫鲁晓夫在文艺界犯下的罪行，让光焰无际的毛主席革命文艺路线来统帅整个文艺大军，让《讲话》一字一句地印在革命文艺工作者的头脑里，贯彻到实际行动中去。
    文艺，作为上层建筑中一个重要组成部分，历来都是掌握在剥削阶级手里，用来为巩固他们的反动统治服务。是我们伟大的领袖毛主席在《讲话》里第一个最鲜明地提出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”《讲话》具有最最鲜明的阶级性。《讲话》从无产阶级的长远利益出发，从根本上解决了文艺为什么人的一系列问题。我们以为，对于文艺工作者本身来说，要解决为什么人的问题，必须解决自己做什么人的问题。毛主席号召我们“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”呆在大城市里，整天抱着“洋、名、古”不放，是不能成为无产阶级的“牛”的。必须遵照毛主席的教导：长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，彻底地改造世界观，把立足点移过来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能成为无限忠于毛主席文艺路线的革命战士。
    要想把立足点移过来，必须到火热的斗争中去活学活用毛主席著作，要创作出为工农兵的文艺，仍然必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去。否则，文艺工作者原来的灵魂就不能被触动。我在深入连队的问题上，犹豫过，走过不少弯路。在连队里，事事都能触及我的灵魂。有一次，班里有两个战士同时感冒了。那天晚上下了雪，很冷，我睡了好半天，两只脚还是冰凉的，冷得睡不着。指导员来查铺时，把他的大衣盖在其中一个有病的战士身上。按说，盖上一件大衣，这个战士暖和一些，也舒服一些了。可他反而翻来复去地睡不着。直到他悄悄地起来，把大衣盖在另一个生病的战友身上，他才安安稳稳地睡着了。为什么呢？因为他是毛泽东思想武装起来的毫不利己专门利人的战士，他真正做到了关心他人比关心自己为重。立足点不同，冷和暖，舒服与不舒服的概念是不相同的。在他心目中，只有让战友暖和，他身上才感到暖和；只有让战友舒服，他心里才感到舒服。睡在这个战士旁边，我觉得我的灵魂被触动了，我更深刻地认识了我们的战士，也更清楚地看见了我自己。
    我们的时代，是毛泽东思想深入人心，“老三篇”在工农兵思想中大放光彩的时代。到处都有伟大毛泽东思想哺育出来的最高尚、最纯粹、最有道德、最脱离低级趣味、最有益于人民的工农兵英雄。问题是，你必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，你必须把立足点移过来，必须来一番彻底的思想改造。否则，就不能理解用毛泽东思想武装起来的共产主义新人。
    可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，和他指使下的周扬一伙反革命修正主义分子却篡改《讲话》，攻击《讲话》，千方百计地把文艺工作者捆在“名利”二字上，关在大城市里，不让你到工农兵群众中去，使我们的立足点永远也无法移到无产阶级这方面来。中国的赫鲁晓夫公开说“可以坐着汽车下乡”，“吃饭、睡觉都可以在汽车上。”在迫不得已的情况下，他也说两句到工农兵群众中去，但不是去向工农兵学习，不是去改造思想，为的是什么“在广大群众的革命斗争中来锻炼、发展自己的个性和特点”。够了！要是照他的办法办，我们立足点什么时候才能移到工农兵这方面来？要是照他的这条路走下去，为工农兵服务的方向被篡改了，文艺工作者烂了，观众、读者中毒了，他的资本主义复辟的美梦也就成了。
    不行！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的这个白日梦，永远也不能让他做成。
    是时候了！是彻底挖掉这条文艺黑线的时候了！文艺工作者不宣传伟大的毛泽东思想，而为资本主义复辟制造舆论，党还要这支文艺队伍干什么！？文艺工作者不为巩固无产阶级专政，不为无产阶级政治服务，党要这支文艺队伍干什么！？彻底打垮这条文艺黑线！把它打翻在地，永世不得翻身！而代之以光焰无际的毛主席的革命文艺路线！
    我们对创立真正无产阶级的新文艺，真正为工农兵的文艺，充满了胜利的信心。通过二十五年的斗争，《讲话》更显示了它的无比伟大。我们只要坚决按照《讲话》所指示的方向前进，坚决地按《讲话》去做，就一定无往不胜。
    我们对创立真正无产阶级的文艺，充满了自豪的感情。因为走在我们队伍前边的，有一位最忠实执行《讲话》、最坚决和文艺黑线作斗争的先锋战士江青同志。江青同志多次嘱咐我们，叫我们在文章中，发言里不要提到她。可是我们不能不讲。
    “乌云压城城欲摧”呵，在反革命修正主义分子周扬一伙气焰万丈的时刻，是谁领导文艺战线上的革命左派为真正的无产阶级文艺杀开了一个突破口？是谁在荆棘丛生的荒原上开拓出一块怒放着八朵鲜花的无产阶级文艺阵地？是江青同志！革命样板戏的出现，是毛主席文艺路线的胜利，是《讲话》的胜利！它生动地告诉我们：只要按照毛主席的指示去做，就能创造出前所未有的、光辉无比的真正的无产阶级文艺来。它使“资”、“封”、“修”搞了几百年、几千年的文艺，黯然失色！封建文化早已没落了，资本主义文化已经腐朽了，修正主义的货色也为世界革命人民所唾弃。伟大的毛泽东思想，正象一轮红太阳从东方升起，它的灿烂无比的光辉，照亮了世界革命文艺的前进道路，正推动世界革命人民走向胜利！
    我们一定要把《讲话》当作座右铭来学，学一辈子，用一辈子。在纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年的今天，让我们同声高呼：
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》万岁！
    长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去！
    打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派！
    彻底批判周扬一伙反革命修正主义文艺路线！
    毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！
    伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
