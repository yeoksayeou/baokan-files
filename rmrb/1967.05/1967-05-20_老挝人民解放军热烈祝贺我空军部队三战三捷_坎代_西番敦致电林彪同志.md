The Lao People's Liberation Army warmly congratulates the victory of our air force in three consecutive battles

Newswire, May 19th - Lin Biao received a congratulatory telegram from the Lao People's Liberation Army General Headquarters, Khamtai Siphandon, warmly congratulating our air force on its glorious victory of shooting down three U.S. aggressor planes in Guangxi in three consecutive battles. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Lin Biao, Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of China:

At the moment when the military and people of Guangxi have consecutively shot down three U.S. aggressor planes, please allow me, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Lao People's Liberation Army, to extend our warmest congratulations to you and, through you, to the military and people of Guangxi.

The head of imperialism, the United States, continues to madly invade, bomb, and strafe China's airspace and territory. This is a barbaric act of aggression and provocation against the 700 million Chinese people. Such heinous acts by U.S. imperialism are absolutely unforgivable. They have received the punishment they deserve from the military and people of Guangxi—five U.S. aggressor planes have been shot down. This is another lesson for U.S. imperialism, proving that great socialist China is not to be trifled with.

The brave fighting and glorious victory of the military and people of Guangxi are a powerful support and encouragement to the Lao military and people who are in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

We wish our brotherly Chinese people and their army greater victories in their struggle against U.S. imperialist provocations and in defending socialist China.

Lao People's Liberation Army General Headquarters
Khamtai Siphandon

    老挝人民解放军热烈祝贺我空军部队三战三捷
    坎代·西番敦致电林彪同志
    新华社十九日讯　林彪同志收到老挝人民解放军最高指挥部坎代·西番敦热烈祝贺我空军部队在广西地区连续三次击落美国强盗飞机的辉煌胜利的贺电。贺电全文如下：中华人民共和国国防部长林彪：
    在广西地区军民连续三次击落美国强盗飞机的时候，请允许我代表老挝人民解放军全体指战员，向您并通过您，向广西地区军民表示热烈的祝贺。
    帝国主义的头子——美国，继续对中国的领空和领土进行疯狂地侵犯、轰炸和扫射，这是对中国七亿人民野蛮侵略挑衅。对于美帝国主义这种罪恶行为，是决不能饶恕的。它受到了广西地区军民给予应得的惩罚——五架美国强盗飞机被击落。这是又一次教训了美帝国主义，伟大的社会主义中国是不可任意侵犯的。
    广西地区军民英勇作战和取得的辉煌胜利，对处于抗美救国斗争中的老挝军民，是最有力的支援和鼓舞。
    预祝兄弟的中国人民及其军队在反击美帝国主义的挑衅和保卫社会主义中国的斗争中取得更大胜利。
    老挝人民解放军最高指挥部
                        坎代·西番敦
                    一九六七年五月九日
