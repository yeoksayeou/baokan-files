Military and civilians in Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces in South Vietnam have launched continuous and fierce attacks over the past four months, achieving the remarkable feat of eliminating and disbanding over 21,300 enemy troops. This includes over 10,100 U.S. invaders killed or wounded, the annihilation of one U.S. infantry battalion, two artillery battalions, one puppet army battalion, and nine "pacification" units, as well as severely damaging six enemy battalions. The liberation forces also shot down or destroyed 195 enemy aircraft, 137 tanks and armored vehicles, 487 other military vehicles, and 66 artillery pieces. The number of enemy troops eliminated is approximately equal to the total number eliminated in 1966, with the number of U.S. troops eliminated being one and a half times that of the previous year.

The report states that after suffering a severe defeat in the Quang Tri and Thua Thien battlefields last summer, the U.S. aggressors, in a desperate struggle, hastily deployed the entire strength of the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Division from the Da Nang base in Quang Nam province to this region. They also brought in several battalions of U.S. artillery, armored units, engineers, and three to five battalions of puppet army paratroopers and marines from Saigon. In the first few months of this year, the U.S. aggressors launched multiple "sweeping" operations in the liberated areas of these two provinces and deployed large numbers of puppet troops for "pacification" activities, attempting to encroach upon the liberated areas and defend the cities and transportation lines.

However, the military and civilians of Quang Tri, Thua Thien, and Hue have bravely defended the liberated areas while continuously launching fierce attacks on the enemy's important strongholds. They have taken the initiative to attack, dispersing and tying down the enemy's forces, disrupting the enemy's military deployments, and putting the enemy in a completely passive and defensive position.

Under the heavy blows of the liberation forces, the U.S. aggressors' "pacification" plans have also failed. Among the enemy's 39 "pacification" units, nine have been completely annihilated, and 12 have been routed. The U.S. and puppet troops covering the "pacification" units have been defeated.

With the continuous victories of the liberation forces, the liberated areas have further expanded, and more combat villages have been established in various places.

Under the heavy blows of the liberation forces, the enemy's attempts to defend the transportation lines and cities have also failed. The first highway, despite being guarded by multiple U.S. and puppet battalions, has been cut off by the guerrillas. Many bridges from Hai Van Pass to Dong Ha have been blown up. Rail transportation has completely collapsed. The ninth highway, guarded by U.S. troops, has not had a single day without being attacked. The U.S. invaders' bases in the northern part of Quang Tri province, such as Yutap, Kontum, Yu Ling, Dong Ha, and Kystar, as well as various highlands on the ninth highway, have all suffered heavy losses from attacks by the liberation army.

According to another report, the liberation forces in Quang Nam province in South Vietnam, from April 21 to May 13, launched continuous attacks on the enemy over 23 days, eliminating nearly 3,000 enemy troops, most of whom were U.S. Marines; shooting down 33 aircraft of various types; and destroying 8 military vehicles.

    南越广治承天两省军民连续猛攻猛打  四个月消灭和瓦解敌人二万一千多名
    包括毙伤美国侵略军一万多并击落击毁敌机近二百架
    新华社河内二十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广治、承天两省军民，在今年头四个月以机动灵活的战术，积极进攻敌人，取得了消灭和瓦解敌人二万一千三百多名的辉煌战果，粉碎了美国强盗所策划的“钳形攻势”计划。
    在被消灭和瓦解的敌人中，包括打死打伤美国侵略军一万零一百多名，全歼美军一个步兵营、两个炮兵营和伪军一个营、九个“绥靖团”，重创美伪军六个营。解放武装力量在这期间还击落击毁敌机一百九十五架，击毁坦克、装甲车一百三十七辆、其他军车四百八十七辆和大炮六十六门。被消灭的敌人数字约等于一九六六年全年消灭敌人的数字，其中，美军被消灭的数字相当于去年的一倍半。
    报道说，美国侵略者自从去年夏季在广治、承天战场上遭到惨败后，为了作垂死的挣扎，慌忙把在广南省岘港基地的美国海军陆战队第三师的全部兵力调到这个地区，并从西贡调来好几个营的美国炮兵、装甲部队、工兵和三到五个营的伪军伞兵和海军陆战队。在今年的头几个月里，美国侵略者向这两个省的解放区发动了多次“扫荡”，同时出动大批伪军进行“绥靖”活动，企图蚕食解放区和守住城镇和交通线。
    但是，广治、承天、顺化军民在英勇保卫解放区的同时，还接连向各重要据点的敌人发动猛烈进攻，他们主动进攻，分散和牵制了敌人的兵力，打乱了敌人的军事部署，使敌人完全陷于被动挨打的境地。
    在解放武装力量的沉重打击下，美国侵略军的“绥靖”计划也遭到破产。在敌人的三十九个“绥靖团”当中，有九个被全歼、十二个被击溃。掩护“绥靖团”的美伪军被打得落花流水。
    随着解放武装力量的节节胜利，解放区进一步扩大，各地建立了更多的战斗村。
    在解放武装力量沉重打击下，敌人死守交通线和城镇的企图也完全破产。第一号公路，虽然驻有多营美伪军，但仍然被游击队切断，从海云岭到东河的许多桥梁被炸毁。铁路运输完全瘫痪。由美国军队守卫的第九号公路，也没有一天不遭到袭击。美国侵略军在广治省北部的育庙、昆天、犹灵、东河、溪星等基地和第九号公路上的各个高地，都接连遭到解放军的进攻，损失惨重。
    另据报道，越南南方广南省解放武装力量，在四月二十一日到五月十三日的二十三天中，连续进攻敌人，共歼敌近三千名，其中大部分是美国海军陆战队；击落各种类型飞机三十三架；击毁军车八辆。
