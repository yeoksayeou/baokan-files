While patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon are bravely fighting against oppression, the British imperialist aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" suddenly appeared off the coast of Hong Kong on May 26. In the past few days, six British warships have arrived in Hong Kong. This is a shameless threat and intimidation by British imperialism against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, attempting to repeat the old tricks of 19th-century imperialist "gunboat policy."

On the same day, the chief culprit in the bloody suppression of our patriotic compatriots, the British Governor of Hong Kong, David Trench, loudly proclaimed that the Hong Kong authorities "have the full support of the British government in maintaining peace and order." This means that the Hong Kong authorities, backed by the British government's "gunboat policy," can become even more arrogant and unrestrained in their suppression of our compatriots in Hong Kong. Look, this British imperialist, a decaying family, actually dares to act like a schoolmaster in front of the great Chinese people, which is simply stupid and laughable.

Let me tell you, British imperialists, your few broken warships are of no consequence to our brave compatriots in Hong Kong, and they are of no consequence to the great Chinese people. The American imperialists are paper tigers, and so are the British imperialists. Don't people know how powerful you are? The American imperialists have already been beaten to a pulp in Vietnam, in a miserable state, and you, this old-fashioned imperialist who relies on American imperialism to barely survive, dare to provoke the 700 million Chinese people? Isn't this like using an egg to hit a stone, too presumptuous?

The "gunboat policy" is a product of the old era when imperialism and colonialism were rampant. In the 20th century, especially after World War II, history has entered a great new era of world revolution, with the winds of people's revolution sweeping across the globe. Imperialism is already on the decline, gasping for breath. The "gunboat policy" has long been thrown into the dustbin of history. Now, British imperialism picks up this trash, and apart from boosting its own morale, it can only bring itself misery and a pathetic end.

Imperialists always misjudge the situation. From their reactionary standpoint, they can never understand the great power of the revolutionary people. As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "We have seen with our own eyes many reactionaries: the Qing government, the Beiyang warlords, Japanese militarism, Mussolini, Hitler, Chiang Kai-shek, one after another they have fallen. They have committed and cannot help but commit errors in thought and action. The same will be true of all the imperialists today."

British imperialism is just like this.

Eighteen years ago, when the Chinese people's revolution was about to achieve nationwide victory, British imperialism did not misjudge the situation and send warships into the Yangtze River to provoke the Chinese people? The result was that they were decisively struck down by the Chinese people and fled like thieves.

Eleven years ago, British imperialism again misjudged the situation, playing the "gunboat policy" in the Middle East and launching the Suez Canal invasion, resulting in a head-on blow from the Egyptian people, leaving them with bloody heads. At that time, British Prime Minister Eden was forced to step down.

Today, British imperialism has not learned a single lesson from history and is again misjudging the situation. British imperialism foolishly thinks that the Chinese people are fully focused on the Cultural Revolution, so perhaps it can take the opportunity to make some gains in the Hong Kong issue. It hopes that by wielding batons and knives in Hong Kong and anchoring a few warships off the coast of Hong Kong, it can resist the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the widespread spread of Mao Zedong Thought.

This is simply a pipe dream. In 1949, the Chinese people had already stood up like giants. Now, after seventeen years of socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially after this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese people are even stronger. And under these circumstances, there are still some people in the world who are itching to feel the might of the Chinese people. Of course, the Chinese people will not be stingy with their strength.

We must once again warn British imperialism that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon will definitely thoroughly settle the score for the heinous crimes you have committed in Hong Kong. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and victorious in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will definitely give you the punishment you deserve! Let the imperialist "gunboat policy" go to hell! If British imperialism insists on its course, it will surely reap what it sows!

    “炮舰政策”早被扔进了垃圾堆！
    本报评论员
    正当我港九爱国同胞英勇展开反迫害斗争的时候，英帝国主义航空母舰“堡垒号”突然于五月二十六日开到香港海面。这几天中间，开到香港的英国军舰已达六艘。这是英帝国主义对我港九爱国同胞的无耻威胁和恫吓，妄图重演十九世纪帝国主义“炮舰政策”的故伎。
    同一天，血腥镇压我爱国同胞的罪魁祸首香港英国总督戴麟趾大肆叫嚷，港英当局“在维持和平和秩序上得到英国政府的全力支持”。这就是说，港英当局有了英国政府“炮舰政策”作靠山，就可以越发逞凶作恶，更加肆无忌惮地镇压香港我国同胞了。你看，英帝国主义这个破落户，居然在伟大的中国人民面前摆出一副教师爷的架式，简直是太愚蠢可笑了。
    老实告诉英帝国主义，你们的那几艘破军舰，根本不在我英勇的香港同胞的眼里，根本不在伟大的中国人民的话下。美帝国主义是纸老虎，英帝国主义还不也是一只纸老虎。你们有多大能耐，人们难道还不清楚吗？美帝国主义已经在越南被打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪，你们这个专门依靠美帝国主义苟延残喘的衰朽透顶的老牌帝国主义，还要向七亿中国人民挑衅，这不是以卵击石，太不自量了吗？
    “炮舰政策”，是帝国主义和殖民主义横行霸道的旧时代的产物。到了二十世纪，特别是第二次世界大战以后，历史进入了世界革命的伟大的新时代，人民革命风雷激荡，帝国主义已经日薄西山，气息奄奄了。“炮舰政策”早已被扔进了历史的垃圾堆。现在，英帝国主义又拣起这个破烂，除了给它自己壮壮胆子以外，只能是自讨苦吃，落得个可悲的结局。
    帝国主义总是错误估计形势的。他们从反动的立场出发，永远不可能了解革命人民的伟大力量。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出：“我们亲眼看到了许多的反革命：清朝政府，北洋军阀，日本军国主义，莫索里尼，希特勒，蒋介石，一个一个地倒下去了，他们犯了并且不可能不犯思想和行动的错误。现在的一切帝国主义也是一定要犯这种错误的。”
    英帝国主义正是这样。
    十八年前，当中国人民革命即将取得全国胜利的时候，英帝国主义不是曾经错误估计形势，把军舰开进扬子江，向中国人民进行挑衅吗？其结果是，遭到了中国人民的坚决打击，象小偷一般逃窜而去。
    十一年以前，英帝国主义又错误估计形势，在中东玩弄“炮舰政策”，发动了苏伊士运河的侵略战争，结果遭到埃及人民的迎头痛击，碰得头破血流。当时的英国首相艾登因此滚下台来。
    今天，英帝国主义丝毫没有从历史的教训中学得一点乖，又在错误估计形势了。英帝国主义一厢情愿地以为，中国人民正在全神贯注于文化大革命，这样，它也许可以乘机在香港问题上捞一点油水了吧。它指望在香港挥舞警棍屠刀，在香港海面上停泊几艘军舰，就能够抵制住中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响和伟大的毛泽东思想的广泛传播。
    这简直是白日作梦。一九四九年，中国人民就已经巨人般地站起来了。现在，经过十七年的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，特别是经过这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，中国人民更加百倍地强大了。而在这种情况下，世界上居然有那么一些家伙，浑身发痒，硬要尝一尝中国人民的厉害。当然，中国人民是决不会吝啬自己的力量的。
    我们要再一次警告英帝国主义，在毛泽东思想指引下的港九爱国同胞，一定要彻底清算你们在香港犯下的滔天罪行，用毛泽东思想武装起来的、在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了伟大胜利的中国人民，一定要给你们应有的惩罚！让帝国主义的“炮舰政策”见鬼去吧！英帝国主义如果一意孤行，必将自食其果！
