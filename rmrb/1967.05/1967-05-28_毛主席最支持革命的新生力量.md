Chairman Mao's "Letter on the Question of Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" has been published! We revolutionary little red guards enthusiastically hail this document of great historical significance! In this letter, Chairman Mao enthusiastically supports the "little people" who dare to fiercely attack bourgeois "authorities," and severely reprimands those "big people" who suppress the revolutionary actions of the "little people." Our great leader Chairman Mao has always been the one who cares for and cherishes the new forces the most, and is the one who most supports the revolutionary actions of the "little people."

Why do those self-proclaimed Marxists within the Party so frantically suppress the revolutionary new forces, but instead expend so much effort in praising bourgeois academic "authorities"? Now the truth has been revealed: it turns out that they themselves are representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, revisionist counter-revolutionaries disguised as Communist Party members, who are unlearned, uninformed, out of touch with the masses, ignorant, relying solely on "arbitrariness and coercion," and usurping the name of the Party—these are big bureaucrats.

History has proven that the "little people" who represent the interests of the advanced class and the direction of social progress are the revolutionary new forces. They are invincible. This group of "little people" dares to revolt and dare to rebel, fearlessly declaring war on the old world. How to treat the "little people" who represent the new forces is an important sign of whether one is revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, a Marxist or a revisionist.

Those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the Party, in order to maintain their usurped leadership and the reactionary revisionist rule of the departments they occupy, constantly and ruthlessly suppress and attack the "little people" who dare to rebel against them and are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The top capitalist-roader in the Party is the ultimate backer of this reactionary force. From the extremely reactionary standpoint and viewpoint of the bourgeoisie, he regards the "little people" who represent the new forces as a thorn in his side. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he frantically pushed the bourgeois reactionary line, ruthlessly suppressing the revolutionary youngsters, which fully illustrates this point.

Chairman Mao is the greatest and most outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time. He is best at discovering new things and nurturing them with the greatest enthusiasm. When the Red Guards, this new thing, just emerged on the horizon and was ruthlessly suppressed by diehard forces, Chairman Mao, with the keen insight of a proletarian revolutionary leader towards new things, immediately saw its boundless vitality and great prospects for development, and expressed enthusiastic support for it. It was under Chairman Mao's warm care and vigorous cultivation that the Red Guards movement, which shook the world, developed rapidly. Tens of thousands of revolutionary "little people"—Red Guards, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, smashed the bourgeois reactionary line that attempted to strangle them, and kept advancing victoriously, making immortal contributions in the Cultural Revolution!

The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are a bunch of fools. They ruthlessly suppress the revolutionary "little people," thinking they are triumphant. In fact, by doing so, they are only lifting a stone to drop on their own feet. Isn't this the case? Not long ago, these "big people" who were once so prominent and invincible on the stage of history have now been swept into the dustbin of history one by one? While the "little people" who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line have become the masters of history. They "point to the rivers and mountains, stir up the words, and trample on the nobles of the past."

"Some classes have triumphed, and some classes have been eliminated. This is history, this is the history of several thousand years of civilization." This is also the history of struggle in the realm of ideology and culture!

New things defeat decaying things, revolutionary "little people" defeat reactionary "big people," this is a universal and irreversible law of the universe.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has placed great hopes in our younger generation. The publication of the "Letter on the Question of Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber'" is another great care and support for us. We must not disappoint the expectations of the old man. We will study the several extremely important historical documents that have recently been published, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    毛主席最支持革命的新生力量
    清华大学井冈山兵团　红勇兵　红宇
    毛主席的《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》发表了！我们革命的红小兵们热烈欢呼这个具有伟大历史意义的文件发表！毛主席在这封信里，热情地支持敢于向资产阶级“权威”猛烈开火的“小人物”，严厉斥责了那些压制“小人物”的革命行动的“大人物”。我们的伟大领袖毛主席，始终是最关心、最爱护新生力量的，是最支持“小人物”的革命行动的。
    为什么党内那些自命为马克思主义者的“大人物”，要如此疯狂地压制革命的新生力量，却用那么大的劲去吹捧资产阶级学术“权威”呢？现在真相已经大白了：原来他们自己就是混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，是披着共产党员外衣的反革命修正主义分子，是一些不读书、不看报、不接触群众、什么学问也没有、专靠“武断和以势压人”、窃取党的名义的大党阀。
    历史证明，代表先进阶级利益、代表社会前进方向的“小人物”，是革命的新生力量。他们是不可战胜的。这批“小人物”敢革命、敢造反，无所畏惧地向旧世界宣战。如何对待代表新生力量的“小人物”，是区分革命还是反革命，是马克思主义者还是修正主义者的一个重要标志。
    那些混进党内的资产阶级代表人物，为了保住他们窃取的领导权，维持他们盘踞的那些部门的反革命修正主义统治，他们总是不断地残酷压制和打击用毛泽东思想武装起来的敢于造他们反的“小人物”。而党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，则是这种反动势力的总后台。他从极端反动的资产阶级的立场、观点出发，把代表新生力量的“小人物”视为眼中钉。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他疯狂推行资产阶级反动路线，残酷镇压革命小将，就充分说明了这一点。
    毛主席是当代最伟大最杰出的马克思列宁主义者。他最善于发现新生事物，并且以最大的热情扶植它成长。当红卫兵这个新生事物刚刚从地平线上冒出来，并且遭到顽固势力残酷镇压的时候，毛主席以无产阶级革命导师对新生事物特有的敏锐目光，一眼就看到了它无限的生命力和伟大的发展前途，立即表示对它的热情支持。正是在毛主席的亲切关怀和大力的培育下，震撼世界的红卫兵运动迅猛异常地发展起来了，成千上万革命的“小人物”——红卫兵，以毛泽东思想为武器，冲垮了企图扼杀他们的资产阶级反动路线，不断胜利前进，在文化大革命中立下了不朽的功勋！
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是一批蠢人。他们残酷地镇压革命的“小人物”，自以为得意。其实，他们这样做，只是搬起了石头砸自己的脚。事实不正是这样吗？曾几何时，这些在历史舞台上显赫一时、不可一世的“大人物”，现在不是一个个被扫进历史的垃圾堆了吗？而那些无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于无产阶级革命路线的“小人物”，却成了历史的主人，他们“指点江山，激扬文字，粪土当年万户侯。”
    “一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”这也是思想文化领域里的斗争史！
    新生事物战胜衰朽事物，革命的“小人物”战胜反动的“大人物”，这是宇宙间普遍的永远不可抗拒的规律。
    伟大领袖毛主席对我们青年一代寄予无限希望。《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》的发表，是对我们的又一次巨大关怀和支持。我们一定不辜负他老人家的期望，好好学习最近发表的这几个极端重要的历史文件，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
