Tens of thousands of revolutionary workers from the capital's financial and commercial system protested and marched in front of the British Consulate, expressing their anger and protesting against the fascist atrocities of the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities. They sent a telegram to compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, firmly supporting their struggle against persecution.

New China News Agency, May 26th: The brutal beatings and arrests of Chinese workers in the trade and banking sectors by the Hong Kong British authorities have sparked immense anger among revolutionary workers in the capital's financial and commercial system. Today, tens of thousands of revolutionary workers from the capital's financial and commercial system formed a protest march to the British Consulate in China, expressing their anger and protesting against the fascist atrocities of the British government and the Hong Kong British authorities, and firmly supporting the struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against persecution.

The protesters held high portraits of Chairman Mao and red-bound copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting slogans in front of the British Consulate: "Strongest protest against the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Firmly support the heroic struggle of Hong Kong patriots!" "Down with the British imperialists, the running dogs of American imperialism!" They plastered the walls of the British Consulate with big-character posters and slogans, and loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various forms of oppression they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only serve to hasten the more extensive and more violent revolution of the people." The officials of the British Consulate hid inside and dared not come out. The revolutionary workers read out a protest letter there. The protest letter stated that the Hong Kong British authorities must take full responsibility for their crimes against all Chinese residents of Hong Kong, otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this must be fully borne by the British government.

On the 24th, the revolutionary workers of the financial and commercial system also sent a telegram to compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, expressing their firmest support for their just struggle. The telegram said, "Compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fearing no sacrifice, fighting bravely and unyieldingly, have engaged in a heroic and unyielding struggle against the enemy, greatly boosting the morale of our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and greatly undermining the arrogance of the Hong Kong British authorities. This fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the Chinese people in fighting to the end with their enemies, and carries forward the glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism of the Chinese nation. You are truly the heroic sons and daughters of the motherland, truly the good students of Chairman Mao. We express our highest respect and warmest greetings to you. We, the revolutionary fighters, together with the people of the whole country, are heart to heart with you, and pledge to be your strong backing. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have an indomitable spirit. We will overcome all enemies and will never be subdued by them. We firmly support you in carrying on the struggle against the unreasonable persecution by the Hong Kong British authorities until victory is achieved, and we will not rest until we achieve complete victory!"

The Chinese workers at the British Consulate also submitted a protest today.

    首都财贸系统数万革命职工到英代办处门前示威游行
    愤怒抗议英政府和港英当局法西斯暴行
    致电港九同胞坚决支持他们反迫害斗争
    新华社二十六日讯　港英当局残酷毒打和逮捕香港贸易和银行界的中国职工，激起了首都财贸系统革命职工的极大愤怒。今天，首都财贸系统革命职工组成数万人的示威游行队伍，前往英国驻华代办处门前，愤怒抗议英国政府和香港英国当局的法西斯暴行，最坚决地支持香港同胞的反迫害斗争。
    示威群众高举毛主席画像和红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，在英国代办处门前愤怒高呼：“最强烈抗议香港英国当局的法西斯暴行！”“坚决支持香港爱国同胞的英勇斗争！”“打倒美帝的帮凶英帝国主义！”他们在英国代办处门前和墙上贴满了抗议的大字报和标语，并且高声朗读毛主席语录：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”英国代办处的官员缩在屋里不敢露面。革命职工们在这里宣读了抗议书。抗议书说，港英当局必须老老实实地向全体香港中国居民承担罪责，否则，由此产生的一切严重后果必须由英国政府全部承担。
    财贸系统革命职工在二十四日还致电港九同胞，对他们的正义斗争表示最坚决的支持。电报说，港九同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不怕牺牲，前赴后继，同敌人进行了英勇卓越、坚贞不屈、针锋相对的斗争，大长了我港九同胞的志气，大灭了港英当局的威风，充分表现了中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的英雄气概，发扬了中华民族不畏强暴、反帝爱国的光荣传统。电报说，你们不愧为祖国的英雄儿女，不愧为毛主席的好学生，我们向你们致以最崇高的敬意，表示最亲切的慰问。电报说，我们革命派的战士们和全国人民一道，同你们心连心，誓作你们强大的后盾。以毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，具有一往无前的精神，我们要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。我们坚决支持你们把反对港英当局无理迫害的斗争进行到底，不获全胜，决不罢休！
    在英国代办处的中国职工，今天也向英国代办处提出了抗议。
