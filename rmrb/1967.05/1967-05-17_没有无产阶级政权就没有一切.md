The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are directed against oppression. The oppressed are allowed to rise up and fight back." The Chinese Khrushchev in his fabricated "Self-Cultivation" never mentions real class struggle, never talks about seizing power, never talks about the dictatorship of the proletariat. Such "Self-Cultivation" is sheer deception.

With power, there is everything; without power, there is nothing. In the old society, the laboring people were exploited by the ruling classes because we had no power. In that world, the sky belonged to the exploiters, the earth belonged to the exploiters. Take our Yemin Village for example. In the old society, there were only twenty-four households of landlords and rich peasants, but they owned more than a thousand mu of fertile land. Meanwhile, the 270-plus households of poor and lower-middle peasants had only about sixty mu of barren hillside land. Even so, those wolf-like exploiters were never satisfied and even tried to squeeze oil out of buckwheat husks. Take our militia instructor An Guoen, for instance. At that time, he had only a piece of land the size of a palm, but it was forcibly seized by a landlord surnamed Zuo. An Guoen was so angry that he couldn't swallow his anger and went to the yamen to sue. But in that dark, cannibalistic society, officials protected officials, clerks protected clerks, and the yamen protected the rich. One lawsuit was not won, but instead, a hornet's nest was stirred up. The landlord arrogantly shouted, "I don't just want your land, with money, I can even buy your life." He colluded with the yamen and had An Guoen imprisoned without cause for fourteen months.

In the old society, every hardship of the laboring people showed: without the power of the proletariat, there is nothing. In the liberated new China, every joyous event of the laboring people's liberation shows: with power, there is everything. The stark contrast between the two societies makes us deeply understand the importance of power. We warn the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road: your wild ambition to usurp the power of the proletariat will never succeed.

We are the militia of the hometown of hero An Yemin, the tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We have not forgotten the bitterness of the old society, and we know even more the sweetness of the new society. "The rights obtained by the people must not be easily lost and must be defended with struggle." We will, like hero An Yemin, firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching on "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and resolutely defend and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat with our blood and lives.

    没有无产阶级政权就没有一切
    辽宁开源城郊公社业民大队民兵连
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”中国的赫鲁晓夫在他炮制的《修养》里，闭口不讲现实的阶级斗争，不讲夺取政权，不讲无产阶级专政，这样的《修养》完全是欺人之谈。
    有了政权，就有了一切；没有政权，就丧失一切。旧社会劳动人民所以给剥削阶级当牛作马，就是因为我们没有政权。在那个世道里，天是剥削者的天，地是剥削者的地。就拿我们业民村来说，旧社会全村只有二十四户地主、富农，他们却占有一千多垧肥得出油的好地；而二百七十多户贫下中农，仅仅占有六十来垧兔子不拉屎的山坡地。就这样，那些恶得象狼似的家伙，仍然贪心不足，甚至连荞麦皮里也想挤出四两油。象我们的民兵指导员安国恩同志，当时只有巴掌大一块儿土地，不知怎么被一个姓左的地主看中了，生撕活拉地硬给霸占了去，气得安国恩咽不下这口气，到衙门去打官司。可谁知在那个人吃人的黑暗社会里，官向官，吏向吏，衙门向着有钱的；一个官司没打赢，反倒捅了马蜂窝，这个地主猖狂地叫嚷什么：“我不光是能要你的地，我有钱还可以买你的命。”勾结衙门把安国恩关进监狱，无缘无故地押了十四个月。
    在旧社会，劳动人民的每一桩苦难遭遇都说明：没有无产阶级的政权就没有一切。在解放了的新中国，劳动人民的每一件翻身的喜事，又都说明：有了政权就有了一切。两个社会，天地之差，使我们深深懂得政权的重要。我们正告党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，你们妄想篡夺无产阶级政权的狼子野心，是永远也不会得逞的。
    我们是英雄安业民家乡的民兵，是无产阶级专政的工具。我们没有忘记旧社会的苦，我们更知道新社会的甜。“人民得到的权利，绝不允许轻易丧失，必须用战斗来保卫。”我们要和英雄安业民一样，牢记毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，坚决用鲜血和生命巩固和保卫无产阶级专政。
