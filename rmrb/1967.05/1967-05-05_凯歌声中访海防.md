The military and civilians of Haiphong, who have recently achieved brilliant victories in their counterattacks against American air pirates, are now full of fighting spirit and vigorously preparing for battle. They are determined to turn the heroic port into a strong fortress and deliver even heavier blows to the American aggressors who dare to continue their attacks.

Victories Are Brilliant and Inspiring

Despite the fact that American imperialism has once again launched extremely savage air raids on this coastal city since April 20, the heroic military and civilians of Haiphong have not been intimidated by the American aggressors' bombs. They have not surrendered in the face of the new escalation of the American imperialist war. The entire military and civilian population are united, bravely rising up to repel the American air pirates. In just the battles from April 20 to April 26, they achieved brilliant victories, shooting down 24 American aggressor planes and capturing a batch of American pilots.

The reporter recently visited this heroic city on a night journey along the road from Hanoi to Haiphong. Along the way, one could see trucks loaded with supplies continuously streaming out of the city towards various directions; sometimes a long train would rush past. On the busy transportation lines, one could often hear the rousing songs and hearty laughter, displaying the revolutionary optimism of the heroic Vietnamese people who are unafraid of hardship and sacrifice.

Training Day and Night

When the reporter arrived in Haiphong, the city was brightly lit. A responsible official from the Haiphong Garrison Command told the reporter: "Although the enemy planes bombed heavily a few days ago, due to the fearless and timely repairs by the line workers, the power supply has never been interrupted. The shops in the city are operating as usual, and the loudspeakers are broadcasting the inspiring victory news and revolutionary songs from the north and south as usual."

The heroic military and civilians of Haiphong, filled with hatred towards the American aggressors, are intensively engaged in production and battle preparations. On the self-defense militia positions scattered throughout the city and suburbs, one can see the anti-aircraft gunners training day and night. They hang model planes on the positions and set up natural markers to determine the height of planes, seizing every opportunity to train and continuously improve their tactics and techniques. The combat service, firefighting, medical aid, and traffic communication organizations composed of local residents are summarizing their battlefield service experience during the lulls in combat. They are also actively building fortifications for the anti-aircraft units, transporting ammunition, cleaning weapons, and shells.

Chinese and Vietnamese Comrades Celebrate Victory Together

We visited a unit of the anti-aircraft artillery that was awarded the honorable title of "Victorious Unit." This heroic battalion participated in 25 battles last year and shot down two American planes.

The political instructor of this battalion, Comrade Minh, confidently told the reporter: "To liberate the south and unify the country, we are determined to fight to the end with the American aggressors. As long as there is one person left on our position, we will continue to fight and achieve a complete victory in the struggle against American aggression for national salvation." He also said: "When we are fighting victoriously, the radio broadcasted the news of the complete annihilation of two invading American planes by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in Guangxi on April 24, which made all the comrades in our battalion feel very excited and inspired. We are very grateful to the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people for their help to our Vietnamese people and army. With the support of our great Chinese brothers, our struggle against American aggression for national salvation will definitely achieve the final victory."

We also visited a high-caliber machine gun squad composed of six male and female self-defense militia members in a bunker set up in a tall building. Despite the shrapnel whizzing around them, they continued to fight during the intense air battles on April 20, 25, and 26. The squad leader, Nguyen Van Yen, pointed to the slogan on the wall, "Determined to defend the beloved sky of Haiphong," and said to us: "We resolutely respond to Chairman Hu's call, always staying alert. If the American aggressors dare to invade, we will definitely blow them to smithereens."

    凯歌声中访海防
    在最近反击美国空中强盗的战斗中接连取得辉煌胜利的海防市军民，正意气风发，斗志昂扬地进行各项战斗准备，决心把英雄的港口变成一座坚强的战斗堡垒，给胆敢继续来犯的美国强盗以更加沉重的打击。
    战果辉煌振奋人心
    尽管美帝国主义从四月二十日起，又多次对这个座落在东海之滨的海港城市进行了极其野蛮的轰炸，但英雄的海防市军民，没有被美国强盗的炸弹吓倒，没有在美帝国主义新的战争“升级”讹诈面前屈服。全体军民万众一心，英勇奋起迎击美国飞贼。仅在四月二十日到二十六日的战斗中，就取得了击落美国强盗飞机二十四架、活捉一批美国飞行员的辉煌胜利。
    记者在最近的一个夜晚，沿着从河内通往海防的公路，访问了这座英雄的城市。沿途只见从城里开出来的满载物资的汽车，川流不息地奔向各方；一长列火车有时从身边呼啸而过。在繁忙的交通运输线上，不时传来雄壮的歌声和阵阵爽朗的笑声，显示着英雄的越南人民不怕艰苦、不怕牺牲的革命乐观主义精神。
    夜以继日加紧训练
    记者来到海防市时，只见市区灯火通明。海防市卫戍司令部一位负责人告诉记者：尽管前几天敌机狂轰滥炸，由于线路工人不怕危险、及时抢修，电力供应一直没有中断过。市内商店照常营业，扩音器里象往常一样播送着南北两方鼓舞人心的胜利捷报和革命歌曲。
    英雄的海防市军民怀着对美国强盗的满腔仇恨，正在紧张地进行生产和战斗准备。在遍布市区和郊区的民兵自卫队阵地上，可以看到猎机手们夜以继日地坚持战斗值班。他们在阵地上高悬飞机模型，树起测定飞机高度的自然标志，抓紧一切时间，加紧练习，不断提高战术、技术。由街区居民组成的战斗服务、消防、救护、交通联络等组织，趁战斗的间隙，正在总结战地服务经验。他们还积极为防空部队修筑工事，运送弹药，擦拭武器和炮弹。
    中越战友共庆胜利
    我们访问了荣获“决胜单位”光荣称号的高炮某部。这个英雄连队，在去年先后参加过二十五次战斗，打下美国飞机两架。
    这个连队的指导员明同志满怀信心地对记者说：“为了解放南方，统一祖国，我们决心同美国侵略者战斗到底。只要我们阵地上还有一个人，我们就要继续战斗下去，夺取抗美救国斗争的彻底胜利。”他还说：“当我们正在胜利地进行战斗的时候，收音机里传来了中国人民解放军空军部队四月二十四日在广西上空全歼入侵的美国飞机两架的胜利消息，使我们全连同志感到非常兴奋，非常鼓舞。我们十分感谢中国共产党和中国人民对我们越南人民和军队的帮助，有着伟大的中国兄弟的支援，我们的抗美救国斗争一定能够取得最后胜利。”
    我们还在设在一座大楼上的工事里，访问了一个由六名男女自卫队员组成的高射机枪小组。他们在四月二十、二十五、二十六日三天的激烈对空战斗中，尽管弹片在他们周围飞啸，但仍一直坚持战斗。战斗组组长阮文寅指着墙上“决心保卫可爱的海防天空”的标语对我们说：“我们坚决响应胡主席的号召，时刻提高警惕，如果美国强盗胆敢来犯，我们就一定要把它打得粉身碎骨。”
