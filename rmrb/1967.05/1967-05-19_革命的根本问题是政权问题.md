The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the drafting of the May 16, 1966, Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This document is a great historical document. It smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen, which attempted to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and restore capitalism, and sounded the charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

The "Report Outline" of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen attempted to lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution astray and protect the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. However, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, their plot was foiled. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution was launched on a nationwide scale. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, unwilling to accept their defeat, hastily put forward the bourgeois reactionary line, implementing white terror, in an attempt to extinguish the blazing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The handful of power-holders within our factory who are taking the capitalist road have, for a long time, loyally carried out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, promoting capitalist methods of operation and material incentives, in an attempt to restore capitalism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we red rebels rose up in rebellion. This handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road then carried out frenzied suppression against us, labeling many revolutionary comrades as "counter-revolutionaries" and "anti-Party elements." They were so arrogant because they held power in their hands.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles are struggles for the seizure of power, for the seizure of this power and for the consolidation and defense of this power." Practice in struggle has enabled us to deeply feel that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of state power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in a word, is that the proletariat must seize back the power usurped by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Under the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, the red rebels in our factory seized the power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After the proletarian revolutionary masses took hold of the power in the factory, we grasped revolution and promoted production, and the entire factory presented a new and vigorous scene.

The struggle of the past year has enabled us to deeply realize that with proletarian state power, we have everything; without state power, we have nothing.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved great victories. However, the class enemy will not resign themselves to their doom. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is still continuing fiercely, and serious tasks of struggle are still before us. Chairman Mao has often instructed us in recent years that the question of who will win and who will lose in the revolution can only be settled over a very long historical period. If things are not handled properly, the restoration of capitalism may occur at any time. We proletarian revolutionaries must not, because of our great victories, relax our vigilance. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to put politics in command, always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and follow our great leader Chairman Mao to the end, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    革命的根本问题是政权问题
    北京市革命委员会常委  北京光华木材厂红色造反者  刘锡昌
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，是一个伟大的历史文献。这个文件，粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团破坏无产阶级文化大革命、妄图实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，吹响了我国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。
    彭真反革命修正主义集团的《汇报提纲》，妄图把无产阶级文化大革命引入歧途，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。但是，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，他们的阴谋破产了。在全国范围内无产阶级文化大革命轰轰烈烈开展了起来。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不甘心他们的失败，便又急急忙忙抛出了资产阶级反动路线，实行白色恐怖，妄想扑灭轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命。
    我们厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，长期以来忠实执行了旧北京市委的反革命修正主义路线，大搞资本主义经营方式，大搞物质刺激，妄图复辟资本主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们红色造反者起来造反了，这一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派就对我们进行了疯狂的镇压，把许多革命同志打成了“反革命”“反党分子”。他们之所以这样猖狂，就是因为他们手中有权。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”斗争的实践，使我们深深地体会到革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级文化大革命，集中到一点，就是无产阶级必须夺回党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺去的权。在伟大领袖毛主席的号召下，我厂红色造反者夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的权。我们无产阶级革命派掌握了厂里的大权以后，抓革命，促生产，全厂呈现了一片朝气勃勃的新气象。
    一年来的斗争，使我们深深认识到，有了无产阶级政权，就有了一切，没有政权就没有一切。
    现在，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得伟大的胜利，但是，阶级敌人决不会甘心他们的灭亡，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，仍在继续激烈地进行，严重的斗争任务还摆在我们面前。毛主席近几年来经常教导我们说，革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。我们无产阶级革命派决不可因已取得伟大的胜利，而丧失警惕，我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓死跟着伟大的领袖毛主席，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
