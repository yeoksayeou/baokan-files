The large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao Inspects the Cultural Revolution Army for the Fifth and Sixth Times" premiered in the capital on the eve of May Day. The revolutionary masses enthusiastically cheered, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

New China News Agency, April 30th: On the eve of May Day, the International Labor Day, the broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres in the capital watched the large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao Inspects the Cultural Revolution Army for the Fifth and Sixth Times" with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. They were greatly inspired and drew boundless fighting strength from it. They expressed their determination to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the capitalist reactionary line represented by the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, making their own contributions to the liberation of all mankind.

When the screen showed our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao inspecting the cultural revolution army, the cinema immediately erupted in waves of enthusiastic applause. So many hearts pounded with excitement; so many people's eyes welled up with tears of joy; so many smiling faces turned towards the reddest sun. Their countless words merged into one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

The revolutionary workers of the Beijing Transportation Company's garage and the Beijing branch of the China Textile Company said excitedly: This film fully demonstrates that our great leader Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and is always heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses; it fully expresses the boundless love of the revolutionary masses for Chairman Mao. They expressed their determination to resolutely criticize and denounce the handful of top capitalist-roaders in the Party and to closely combine this struggle with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, further advancing the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and seizing victory in both revolution and production.

The soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, who had received revolutionary teachers and students from all over the country, were particularly moved after watching this film. They said: We, the people's children, will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, and resolutely stand together with the broad masses of revolutionary cadres in the capital, fight together, and win together. Soldiers of a certain unit of the PLA, who had the honor of being inspected by Chairman Mao together with the revolutionary youngsters, once again saw Chairman Mao inspecting the cultural revolution army on the screen, and they spontaneously raised their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," enthusiastically cheering: "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

The Red Guards of the Capital Universities' Revolutionary Committee said: Our most beloved leader Chairman Mao! You care the most about our growth. When your glorious image appears on the screen, it is like the sun rising in the east, with countless rays of light shining on our hearts, and streams of warmth warming our hearts. We have so much to say to you! We promise you: We will definitely read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions to strive to be strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Some revolutionary youngsters of the Capital Middle Schools' Revolutionary Committee said: This film once again brought us to the side of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, making us recall the happy moment when Chairman Mao inspected us. We solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: Our heads may be cut off, our blood may flow, but Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will never be abandoned! We will forever hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, care about state affairs, resolutely overthrow the handful of top capitalist-roaders in the Party, and swear to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.
