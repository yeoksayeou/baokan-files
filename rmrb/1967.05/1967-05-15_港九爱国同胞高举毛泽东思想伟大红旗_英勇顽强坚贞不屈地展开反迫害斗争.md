The British authorities in Hong Kong, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, have launched a large-scale fascist bloodbath. The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have bravely and tenaciously launched a struggle against persecution. Workers, youth, students, shop assistants, cultural workers, and patriotic compatriots from all walks of life have held meetings to denounce the crimes of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

The New China News Agency, Hong Kong, May 14 - The British authorities in Hong Kong dared to make an enemy of all the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million people of China. Recently, they have repeatedly sent out large numbers of armed police to brutally suppress our compatriots in Hong Kong. According to incomplete statistics, they have already arrested over 400 people. The British authorities in Hong Kong have committed this serious act of bloodshed, which has provoked strong protests from the compatriots in Hong Kong.

This large-scale act of brutal suppression began with the British authorities in Hong Kong directly intervening in a labor dispute at the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory in the New Kowloon district of San Po Kong. This was a premeditated, organized, and planned fascist bloodbath carried out by the British authorities in Hong Kong in collusion with U.S. imperialism to counter China.

Before the British authorities in Hong Kong intervened in the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory incident, they had already, on the morning of May 4, carried out a forced demolition of houses in the Kowloon City Walled Village. At that time, the British authorities in Hong Kong suddenly sent over a hundred armed police to the Kowloon City Walled Village, blocking the roads and preventing residents from leaving. They forcibly demolished houses on Long City Road and Long Tsing Road. Residents protested, but the British police drew their guns and threatened the residents, arresting two people on the spot and later detaining representatives who came to negotiate. This incident provoked strong protests from the residents of the Kowloon City Walled Village.

On the afternoon of May 6, the British authorities in Hong Kong again sent over 200 fully armed police and "riot control" personnel to brutally suppress the workers of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory in the New Kowloon district of San Po Kong, who were fighting against increased exploitation by the management. The workers put up a brave resistance, and nearly a hundred workers and compatriots were beaten and injured, one of whom was seriously injured and hospitalized, and twenty-one were arrested without cause.

On the afternoon of May 11, the situation continued to develop, and the British authorities in Hong Kong once again brutally suppressed the workers of the Artificial Flower Factory and the workers, teachers, and students from various circles who came to express their support, arresting 127 people.

On May 12, the British authorities in Hong Kong arrested over a hundred residents in the northeastern part of Kowloon under a curfew. An 18-year-old youth was seriously injured in the head and died in the hospital on the morning of May 13.

By May 13, the British authorities in Hong Kong continued to expand their brutal suppression of our compatriots in Hong Kong. The British "riot control" forces used tactics of surprise attacks and encirclement to beat and arbitrarily arrest the masses. On this day, over a hundred more people were detained.

According to the British authorities in Hong Kong on the morning of May 14, since May 11, they have illegally arrested 391 compatriots in Hong Kong.

At the same time, the British authorities in Hong Kong have also conducted illegal interrogations and trials of a large number of compatriots in Hong Kong, falsely accusing them of various fabricated crimes.

These series of facts show that the British authorities in Hong Kong have carried out a large-scale suppression of our compatriots in Hong Kong in a planned and premeditated manner.

On April 13, the management of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory announced a series of harsh regulations to increase exploitation and strengthen oppression. On April 28, they arbitrarily dismissed hundreds of workers from the main factory and the Kowloon branch. The workers, in order to defend their jobs and basic living conditions, sent representatives to repeatedly request negotiations with the management, but were refused. The workers, in order to seek a reasonable solution, wore Chairman Mao's badges and held copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in front of the Kowloon New Kowloon district of San Po Kong branch, conducting orderly protests.

The British authorities in Hong Kong were terrified and hostile to see the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon studying the works of Chairman Mao. They colluded with the management of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory and, on the afternoon of May 6 at 4:30, used an excuse to provoke an incident, instructing the factory manager to beat the workers. Ten minutes later, Senior Police Inspector Gu Ba, leading a large number of police in five police cars, arrived at the factory and sealed off the scene. Immediately afterwards, the British "riot control" forces, riding in eight large trucks, also arrived. These "riot control" forces, wearing steel helmets and armed with shields, batons, handcuffs, rifles, carbines, submachine guns, and tear gas launchers, rushed towards the crowd, swinging batons and gun butts, beating anyone they saw. Some workers and compatriots were beaten to the ground and trampled; some were beaten until they were covered in blood; some were dragged by the hair and forced onto police cars. Some of the injured workers who were pushed onto the police cars held up "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in the car and shouted slogans such as "Protest against the British authorities' fascist atrocities" and "Long live Chairman Mao."

When the British police were brutally suppressing the workers of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory, many workers and masses from nearby factories immediately came to support them, but were also brutally beaten by the British police. The workers from various factories could no longer bear it, and they threw iron blocks, stones, and glass bottles from the upper floors to retaliate, scaring the "paper tigers" to hide and flee. By around 8:00 PM that evening, the British police and "riot control" forces hastily withdrew from the scene.

That evening, the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union sent three representatives to the Kowloon British police station in Wong Tai Sin to negotiate and protest, but they were also illegally detained by the British authorities in Hong Kong.

On May 9, the workers of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory, with the support of the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, continued their struggle in front of the factory gate. They loudly read quotations from Chairman Mao, sang songs from "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and re-pasted the quotations from Chairman Mao and protest slogans that the British authorities had secretly washed off the factory walls.

At noon on May 11, nearly a hundred workers of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory formed an orderly queue in front of the factory gate, strongly protesting the British authorities' intervention in the labor dispute of the factory and their deliberate creation of a bloody incident. The workers held "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wore Chairman Mao badges on their chests, repeatedly reading quotations from Chairman Mao, shouting slogans, and singing songs such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Unity is Strength." Patriotic compatriots from various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon came in an endless stream to express their support and encouragement, giving the workers great encouragement.

At 3:30 PM, the British authorities began a larger-scale brutal suppression. They sent out thousands of armed police and "riot control" forces, armed with shields, batons, and automatic rifles, in police cars to the scene. Under the command of the British "Kowloon East District Superintendent" Iordan, they formed a line and fired wooden bullets at the students present, injuring a female student on the spot. They then swung their shields and batons, charging towards the young people, beating anyone they saw, and dragging the injured onto police cars. Then, the "riot control" forces forcibly drove away the workers of the Hong Kong Artificial Flower Factory who were still struggling, and ran amok, brutally beating and chasing passersby and nearby residents, continuously firing wooden bullets and tear gas at the crowds, injuring many people. On this day alone, according to the British authorities' announcement, 127 people were arrested.

These executioners, fearing that their crimes would be exposed, openly interfered with the activities of news reporters, repeatedly threatening reporters, and savagely beating reporters from the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch and Hong Kong patriotic newspapers who were conducting normal interviews on the spot. It has been confirmed that five reporters were injured. Reporters from the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch, "Wen Wei Po," "Ta Kung Pao," and "Sing Tao Daily" immediately protested to the British "Kowloon East District Superintendent" Iordan, who was in charge of this bloody incident.

The British authorities in Hong Kong, in order to further suppress the Chinese compatriots, announced a curfew in multiple areas of Kowloon starting from 9:30 PM on May 11.

The workers, patriotic students, and compatriots from various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, showed unyielding bravery and righteous indignation in the face of the enemy's brutal suppression, fully demonstrating the great fearlessness of the Chinese people. When the executioners raised their wooden bullet guns to shoot at the patriotic students from a distance of more than ten feet, dozens of young people linked arms and loudly recited, "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sternly denounced the British authorities' fascist atrocities. A young man, despite the enemy's shooting, rushed up to a police officer, angrily pointing at him, and shouted, "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers!" The police officer hurriedly moved aside in fear. A worker, covered in blood from being beaten, was forcibly pushed onto a prison car but still stubbornly stuck his head out of the car to let the reporter photograph the evidence of the British authorities' atrocities. Some compatriots in the prison car angrily faced the fascist thugs, denouncing their bloody atrocities. When these thugs were beating and chasing a group of people, another group of people, in order to help their compatriots, threw bricks, stones, and glass bottles at the thugs from behind; when the thugs turned around to beat and chase this group of people, that group of people regrouped and retaliated against the thugs with the same methods. Workers and compatriots in factories and residences also threw stones and glass bottles at these thugs, surrounding the fascist thugs.

The British authorities in Hong Kong's brutal suppression of workers' fascist atrocities has provoked the extreme anger of compatriots from various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union issued a solemn statement on May 7, strongly protesting the British authorities' deliberate creation of a massacre. The statement demanded that the British authorities immediately release the arrested worker representatives, workers, and compatriots; severely punish the culprits and compensate for all the workers' losses; guarantee the safety of workers' persons and ensure that similar persecution incidents do not occur in the future; respect the basic rights of workers and ensure that they do not interfere with labor disputes in the future. The statement also expressed that they would not rest until they achieved complete victory. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions held an emergency meeting of all directors on May 12, unanimously deciding to establish the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Workers' Committee Against British Persecution" to present four solemn demands to the British authorities and call on workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, further unite, and continue the struggle against persecution to the end. Workers, youth, students, shop assistants, cultural and artistic workers, and patriotic compatriots from various strata in Hong Kong and Kowloon have held meetings or written letters to the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po," "Ta Kung Pao," denouncing the British authorities' fascist atrocities. They warned the British authorities: The blood debt you owe to the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong must be repaid. The Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with! "If you don't offend me, I won't offend you. If you offend me, I will offend you." We must act according to Chairman Mao's teaching. The British authorities' crazy creation of fascist atrocities will only result in "lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet."

    港英当局配合美帝反华制造大规模法西斯血腥暴行
    港九爱国同胞高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    英勇顽强坚贞不屈地展开反迫害斗争
    工人、青年、学生、店员、文艺工作者和各界爱国同胞纷纷集会愤怒声讨港英当局罪行
    新华社香港十四日电　香港英国当局胆敢与全香港中国同胞和七亿中国人民为敌，最近连续出动大批武装警察血腥镇压我香港同胞，据不完全统计，前后已逮捕四百多人。香港英国当局这一严重的血腥暴行，激起了香港同胞的强烈抗议。
    这次大规模的血腥镇压事件，起因于港英当局直接插手香港人造花厂九龙新蒲岗分厂的劳资纠纷。这是香港英国当局为配合美帝国主义反华，有组织、有计划、有预谋地制造的一次疯狂的法西斯血腥暴行。
    在港英当局插手香港人造花厂事件之前，港英当局就曾在五月四日上午制造了强拆九龙城寨民房事件。当时，港英当局突然出动百余名武装警察到九龙城寨，封锁路口，禁止居民外出，大拆龙城路和龙津路一些民房。居民据理抗议，港英警察竟拔枪威吓居民，并在现场拘捕两人，事后又拘留了前往交涉的坊众代表。此事激起了九龙城寨居民的强烈抗议。
    六日下午，香港英国当局又出动了二百多名全副武装的警察和“防暴队”队员，血腥镇压香港人造花厂九龙新蒲岗分厂工人反对资方加重剥削的正义斗争。工人进行了英勇反抗，有近百名工人和同胞被毒打受伤，其中一人重伤入院，二十一人被无理逮捕。
  十一日下午，事态继续发展，香港英国当局再一次疯狂镇压人造花厂的工人和前来慰问的工人、师生和各界同胞，并逮捕了一百二十七人。
    十二日香港英国当局又在九龙东北部宵禁区内逮捕一百多名居民。一名十八岁青年头部被击受重伤，十三日晨已在医院死去。
    到十三日，港英当局对香港同胞的血腥镇压仍在继续扩大，港英“防暴队”用突袭、迂回包围等手段，毒打和滥捕群众，这一天又有一百多人被拘捕。
    仅据港英当局十四日晨宣布，从十一日以来，港英当局非法逮捕的香港同胞共有三百九十一人。
    在这同时，香港英国当局还对大批香港同胞进行了非法审讯和判决，诬加各种莫须有的罪名。
    这一连串事实说明，香港英国当局大规模镇压我香港同胞，完全是有计划的，是蓄谋已久的。
    四月十三日，香港人造花厂的资方公布了一系列加重剥削和加强压迫的苛刻条例，四月二十八日又无故开除总厂和九龙分厂几百名工人。这个厂的工人为了维护职业和起码的生活条件，派出代表一再要求与资方谈判，但遭到拒绝。工人为了争取合理解决，他们连续几天戴着毛主席像章，举着《毛主席语录》，在九龙新蒲岗分厂前进行有秩序的抗议。
    港英当局看到港九爱国同胞学习毛主席著作，十分恐惧和仇视，便勾结香港人造花厂资方，于五月六日下午四时半借故挑衅，制造事端，指使工厂的总管动手殴打工人。十分钟后，香港英国当局高级警司谷巴率领大批警察乘坐五辆警车开到工厂附近，封锁现场。紧接着，港英“防暴队”乘坐八辆大卡车也开到。这批“防暴队”头戴钢盔，手持藤牌、警棍、手铐、步枪、卡宾枪、冲锋枪、催泪弹发射枪等，一下车就扑向人群，挥舞警棍、枪托，见人就打，有的工人和同胞被打倒在地，遭到践踏；有的被打得血流满面；有的被连拖带拉揪着头发押上警车。有些被推上警车的受伤工人，在车上高举着《毛主席语录》，高呼“抗议港英当局法西斯暴行”、“毛主席万岁”等口号。
    港英警察血腥镇压香港人造花厂工人的时候，邻近工厂的许多工人和群众立即前来声援，也遭到丧心病狂的港英警察的毒打。各厂工人忍无可忍，他们从楼上用铁块、石头、玻璃瓶进行回击，吓得“纸老虎”躲的躲，藏的藏。到当日下午八时许，港英警察和“防暴队”匆匆撤离现场。
    当天晚上，港九树胶塑胶业总工会派出三名代表前往九龙港英黄大仙警署交涉和抗议，也遭到港英当局的无理扣押。
    五月九日，香港人造花厂的工人在港九爱国同胞的支持下，继续在工厂门前进行斗争，他们高声朗读毛主席语录，高唱毛主席语录歌，并且把港英当局派人偷偷洗刷掉的毛主席语录纸和抗议标语又重新贴在工厂的墙壁上。
    十一日中午，香港人造花厂工人近百人在工厂门前排成整齐的队伍，强烈抗议港英当局插手该厂劳资纠纷，蓄意制造血腥暴行。工人们手持《毛主席语录》，胸前佩戴着毛主席像章，一遍又一遍地高声朗读毛主席语录，高呼口号，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》和《团结就是力量》等歌曲。港九各界爱国同胞川流不息地一批批前来慰问和声援，给工人们以巨大的鼓舞。
    下午三时半，港英当局开始了更大规模的血腥镇压。它们出动了大批武装军警和“防暴队”千余人，手持藤牌、警棍和自动步枪，乘警车开到现场，在港英“九龙东区总警司”伊令和指挥下，摆开阵势，向在场的师生发射木弹，当场打伤一名女学生，然后挥舞着藤牌、警棍冲向青少年，见人就打，打伤了的就连拖带拉押上警车。接着，“防暴队”又强行驱逐在那里坚持斗争的香港人造花厂工人，并且到处乱窜，疯狂地毒打和追捕途人和附近居民，不断地向群众发射木弹和催泪弹，使许多人受伤。在这一天，仅根据港英当局宣布，就逮捕了一百二十七人。
    这些刽子手由于害怕他们的罪行公诸于世，竟公然干涉新闻记者的活动，一再恫吓记者，并野蛮殴打在现场进行正常采访活动的新华社香港分社记者和香港爱国报纸记者，据查明，已有五名记者被打伤。新华社香港分社，《文汇报》、《大公报》和《新晚报》的记者当场向指挥这次血腥暴行的港英“九龙东区总警司”伊令和提出强烈抗议。
    港英当局为了进一步镇压中国同胞，宣布从十一日晚九时三十分开始在九龙多处地区实行宵禁。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的香港工人、爱国师生和各界同胞在敌人的残暴镇压面前，英勇不屈，正气凛然，充分表现了伟大的中国人民大无畏的英雄气概。当刽子手们在相隔十余英尺的地方举起木弹枪向爱国师生射击的时候，几十名青少年手挽手高声朗诵“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”高呼“毛主席万岁！”严词斥责港英当局的法西斯暴行。一名少年不顾敌人的射击，冲到一名警官面前，愤怒地指着他，高呼“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎！”吓得这名警官慌忙向旁边躲开。一位被打得满身鲜血的工人被强推上囚车后，仍然顽强地把头伸出车外，让记者拍摄下港英当局的暴行罪证。有些同胞在囚车上愤怒地面对着法西斯暴徒，谴责他们的血腥暴行。当这些暴徒毒打和追捕一部分群众时，另一部分群众为了帮助自己的同胞解围，就在后面向暴徒投掷砖块、石头和玻璃瓶；当暴徒转过身来毒打和追捕这部分群众时，那部分群众又重新集结起来用同样的办法向暴徒进行还击。在工厂和住宅里的工人和同胞也纷纷向这些暴徒投掷石块和玻璃瓶，法西斯暴徒陷于群众的重重包围中。
    香港英国当局血腥镇压工人的法西斯暴行，激起了港九各界同胞的无比愤怒。港九树胶塑胶业总工会七日发表严正声明，最强烈抗议港英当局蓄意制造血案。声明向港英当局提出立即释放被捕的工人代表、工人和同胞；严惩凶手及赔偿工人一切损失；切实保障工人人身安全，保证今后不发生同样迫害事件；尊重工人基本权益，保证今后不得干预劳资纠纷等四项要求，并表示不获全胜，决不罢休。港九工会联合会十二日举行全体理事紧急会议，会上一致通过成立“港九各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会”，向港英当局提出四项严正要求，并号召港九工人更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步团结起来，把反迫害斗争进行到底。港九各业工人、青年、学生、店员、文化艺术工作者和各阶层爱国同胞，连日来纷纷举行集会，或者写信给香港《文汇报》、《大公报》，愤怒声讨港英当局的法西斯暴行，他们警告港英当局：你们欠下香港中国同胞的血债一定要偿还。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的港九中国同胞不可侮！“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。”我们一定要按照毛主席的这一教导办事。港英当局疯狂制造法西斯暴行，到头来只会“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
