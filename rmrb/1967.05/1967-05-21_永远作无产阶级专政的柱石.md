The important Marxist-Leninist document, the "Notice" personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao, has smashed the counterrevolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Zhen and the behind-the-scenes supporters, the top capitalist-roaders in the Party, who attempted to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. It has sounded the charge for a general offensive against these counterrevolutionary revisionists. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

The "Notice" tells us: Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is focused on the issue of power, that is, the proletariat must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie seeks to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat.

With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. Why did the laboring people suffer before liberation? Why do they enjoy a happy life after liberation? It is because power is in the hands of different classes.

In the old society, the landlords and capitalists, who made up a tiny fraction of the population, held power. They lived in luxury without labor, cruelly exploiting and oppressing the laboring people, and leading debauched lives. The broad masses of laboring people toiled all year round but could not even clothe or feed themselves. At that time, my family, like the poor peasants throughout the country, had suffered for generations. Because of the hard life, my father took my 15-year-old brother to the city to make a living by cleaning latrines. One winter, my brother went to a house of a Kuomintang secret agent to clean the latrine. The agent said my brother disturbed his sweet dream and beat him unconscious. When my brother regained consciousness, the blood in his mouth had frozen with the snow. That was how the laboring people lived in those days.

Today, the broad masses of laboring people have stood up politically, economically, and culturally. We laboring people being able to be masters of our own fate is not something that fell from the sky; it is the power we seized from the enemy with our guns under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao.

The class enemies have been defeated, but they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They always dream of overthrowing our proletarian power and restoring capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not easily accept their defeat. They will struggle to the end. They will try to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour." There is a soldier in our company whose village has a landlord with three sons named "Ayao," "Abao," and "Achou," which together mean "revenge." Look, this is the reactionary nature of the class enemies.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counterrevolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of these people have been exposed by us, while others have not. Some are still being trusted by us and are being groomed as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchev. They are now sleeping beside us. All levels of the Party Committee must pay full attention to this." The top capitalist-roader in the Party is the most dangerous Khrushchev-like figure sleeping beside us. Class struggle is indeed sharp, complex, and heart-rending, and it must not be taken lightly! We must root out all the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated various fields, wage a struggle to seize power from them, and fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to the end. If we do not do this, the revolution will fail, power will be lost, the people will suffer, and the country will perish.

We are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We understand best that power is the lifeline of our proletariat. We will respond to the call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, seriously study the "Notice," this great historical document. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly grasp the gun, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat to the death.

    永远作无产阶级专政的柱石
    铁道兵“硬骨头战士”　张春玉
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央《通知》，是一个极其重要的马克思列宁主义的文件。它粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团及背后支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图推翻无产阶级专政、实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，吹响了向这一伙反革命修正主义分子发动总攻击的冲锋号。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    《通知》告诉我们：无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题，即无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。
    有了政权，就有了一切，而丧失政权，就丧失一切。解放前劳动人民为什么受苦受难呢？解放后劳动人民为什么能过幸福的生活呢？就是因为政权掌握在不同阶级的手里。
    在那万恶的旧社会里，占全国人口极少数的地主、资本家掌握了政权，他们不劳而获，残酷地剥削和压迫劳动人民，过着荒淫无耻的生活，而广大的劳动人民，终年劳动，却衣不蔽体，食不饱腹。那时，我的家和全国贫苦农民一样，祖祖辈辈受苦。由于生活困苦，我父亲带着十五岁的哥哥到城里掏粪过日子。有一年冬天，我哥哥到一个国民党特务家里敲门掏粪，这个特务说什么扰乱了他的美梦，把我哥哥打昏在地。哥哥苏醒过来的时候，口里流出来的血和雪冻在一起了。那时候，劳动人民就是这样过日子的。
    今天，广大的劳动人民在政治、经济、文化上翻了身。我们劳动人民能够当家作主决不是从天上掉下来的，而是我们劳动人民在伟大的领袖毛主席领导下，依靠枪杆子从敌人手里夺取来的权利。
    阶级敌人被我们打倒了，但是，他们人还在，心不死，时时妄想推翻我们无产阶级的政权，复辟资本主义。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。……他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”我们班有个战士，他村子里的一个地主有三个儿子，取名叫“阿要”、“阿报”、“阿仇”，合起来就是“要报仇”。看，这就是阶级敌人的反动本性。
    毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫式的最危险的人物。阶级斗争真是尖锐复杂、惊心动魄，万万不可等闲视之！我们一定要把混入各个领域里的资产阶级代表人物统统揪出来，对他们进行夺权的斗争，把他们斗倒、斗垮、斗臭。我们如果不这样做，革命就要失败，政权就要丧失，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。
    我们是毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，最懂得政权是我们无产阶级的命根子。我们一定响应毛主席和党中央的号召，认真地学习《通知》这个伟大的历史文件。我们要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，紧紧地握住枪杆子，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政。
