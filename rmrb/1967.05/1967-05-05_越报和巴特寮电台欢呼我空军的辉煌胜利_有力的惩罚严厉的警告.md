Vietnamese newspapers and Pathet Lao Radio hail the glorious victory of our air force
A powerful punishment and a stern warning

	Newspaper reports from Hanoi, May 4: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" both published commentaries on May 4, strongly condemning the U.S. aggressor planes that invaded China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on May 2, dropping bombs and launching air strikes in a brazen act of war provocation.

	The commentary in the "People's Daily" pointed out that U.S. imperialism has always harbored hostility towards the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China. It has repeatedly dispatched aircraft and warships to invade China's airspace and territorial waters, bombing and strafing Chinese ships and territory, causing damage to Chinese people's lives and property. The commentary said that the recent victory of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army in shooting down five U.S. invading aircraft in eight days is a stern warning to the U.S. aggressors. U.S. imperialism's acts of war provocation against China will not end well.

	The commentary said that the Vietnamese people angrily condemn U.S. imperialism's blatant war provocation against the People's Republic of China and firmly believe that, as warned by the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of National Defense, if U.S. imperialism dares to continue its provocations against China, it will surely face severe punishment.

	The commentary in the "People's Army Daily" said that China and Vietnam are close brothers, fighting side by side to resolutely smash all war conspiracies of the U.S. aggressors.

	According to a report from Khamkeut, May 4: Pathet Lao Radio published a commentary on May 4, enthusiastically hailing the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force in shooting down five U.S. aggressor planes in eight days. It pointed out that this is a most severe and powerful warning from the great 700 million Chinese people to the warmongering group in the U.S. that dares to invade their motherland.

	The commentary pointed out that the U.S. is suffering defeats in Laos and is being beaten senseless in both North and South Vietnam. Every time it invades China, it suffers heavy blows. This proves that the U.S. is being beaten black and blue everywhere, and its so-called "air superiority" cannot intimidate the revolutionary people.

    越报和巴特寮电台欢呼我空军的辉煌胜利
    有力的惩罚严厉的警告
    新华社河内四日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》四日分别发表评论，强烈谴责美国强盗飞机二日侵入中国广西壮族自治区上空，悍然投弹轰炸的猖狂的战争挑衅。
    《人民报》的评论指出，美帝国主义一贯仇视中国人民和中华人民共和国，一再派遣飞机、军舰侵犯中国的领空和领海，轰炸、扫射中国的船只和领土，使中国人民的生命、财产遭到损失。评论说，英雄的中国人民解放军最近在八天内击落美国入侵强盗飞机五架的胜利，是对美国侵略者的严正警告。美帝国主义对中国进行战争挑衅绝不会有好下场。
    评论说，越南人民愤怒谴责美帝国主义对中华人民共和国的极其明目张胆的战争挑衅，并且坚信，正如中国国防部发言人所警告的，如果美帝国主义胆敢继续对中国进行挑衅，它必将受到严厉的惩罚。
    《人民军队报》的评论说，中国和越南是唇齿相依的亲兄弟，两国人民并肩战斗，坚决粉碎美国侵略强盗的一切战争阴谋。
    据新华社康开四日电　巴特寮电台四日发表评论，热烈欢呼中国人民解放军空军部队在八天内击落美国强盗飞机五架的辉煌胜利，指出这是伟大的七亿中国人民对胆敢侵犯他们的祖国的美国好战集团的一个最严厉最有力的警告。
    评论指出，美帝正在老挝遭到失败，也正在越南南北两方被打得晕头转向，它每次侵犯中国都遭到沉重的打击。这证明美帝到处都被打得焦头烂额，美帝的所谓“空中优势”是吓不倒革命人民的。
