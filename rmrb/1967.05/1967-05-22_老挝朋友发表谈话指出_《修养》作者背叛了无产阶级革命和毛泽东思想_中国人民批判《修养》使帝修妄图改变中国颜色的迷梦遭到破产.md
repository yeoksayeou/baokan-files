A Lao news worker recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter and said: "The author of 'Self-Cultivation' betrayed proletarian dictatorship, betrayed the proletarian revolution, and betrayed Mao Zedong Thought."

He pointed out that the book "Self-Cultivation" obstructs the development of revolutionary forces and fosters the growth of revisionism. He said, "Self-Cultivation" avoids discussing how China was conducting the war of resistance against Japan at that time and does not mention at all how the proletariat should seize power and how to implement dictatorship. Instead, it talks about "self-cultivation" while being detached from real struggles.

This news worker emphasized that the current criticism of "Self-Cultivation" has made imperialism and revisionism disappointed and afraid, because the imperialists' and revisionists' delusion of changing China's color has been thoroughly shattered. This fully demonstrates the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought.

    中国人民批判《修养》使帝修妄图改变中国颜色的迷梦遭到破产
    新华社康开电　老挝一位新闻工作者最近对新华社记者发表谈话指出：“《修养》的作者背叛了无产阶级专政，背叛了无产阶级革命，背叛了毛泽东思想。”
    他指出，《修养》一书阻碍革命力量的发展，滋长了修正主义的产生。他说，《修养》一书避而不谈当时中国怎样进行抗日战争，根本不谈无产阶级应该怎样掌握政权、应该怎样实行专政，而是脱离现实斗争去谈什么“自我修养”。
    这位新闻工作者强调指出，现在批判《修养》，使帝国主义和修正主义失望和害怕，因为帝国主义和修正主义妄想中国改变颜色的迷梦彻底破产了。这充分显示出了毛泽东思想的强大威力。
