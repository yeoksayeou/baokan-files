Joint Statement by Chinese People's Organizations Condemning U.S. Imperialism and Israel's Provocations Against Arab Countries

Victory Will Surely Belong to the Heroic Arab People

Soviet Revisionists Acting as U.S. Imperialism's Henchmen Will Meet a Bad End for Betraying the Arab People

New China News Agency, May 28th — The Chinese People's Association for Afro-Asian Solidarity and eight other organizations issued a joint statement today, expressing resolute support for the Arab people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel. The full text of the joint statement is as follows:

The Chinese people, with extreme indignation, are watching the aggressive plot being hatched by U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, in the Middle East. The Chinese people fully endorse the statement issued by our government on May 27th, strongly condemning the war provocations by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the Arab countries, and resolutely supporting the just struggle of the Syrian, Egyptian, and Arab peoples to smash this aggressive plot.

Israel, the tool of U.S. imperialism, has massed large numbers of troops along the Syrian and Egyptian borders, preparing to launch a large-scale armed provocation, and is openly threatening to use force. The U.S. Sixth Fleet has also entered the eastern Mediterranean, conducting military intimidation. The U.S. is also colluding with the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and using its puppet, the United Nations, to serve its aggressive plot. The independence and security of the Arab countries are facing serious threats. U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit inciting Israel to invade the Arab countries.

The Arab people are a great and heroic people. Facing the war provocations by U.S. imperialism and Israel, the Syrian, Egyptian, and Arab peoples are united in their hatred of the enemy, ready for battle, and prepared at any moment to strike back at the aggressors. Egypt has decisively rejected the U.S.'s five arrogant demands, ordered the United Nations Emergency Force to withdraw from the Gaza Strip and Egyptian territory, and declared a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba. The struggle of the Syrian and Egyptian peoples has received strong support from the peoples of the Arab countries. The determination and actions of the Arab people are excellent! It greatly undermines the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and greatly boosts the fighting spirit of all oppressed peoples!

The Soviet revisionist leadership is actively peddling the so-called "Tashkent spirit," attempting to force the Arab people to abandon their just struggle of self-defense and surrender to U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel. The role played by the Soviet revisionist leadership has once again exposed it as the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism.

However, no matter how rampant U.S. imperialism and its henchmen may be, they will surely come to a bad end. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "If the U.S. monopoly capitalist clique insists on pursuing its policy of aggression and war, it will inevitably be hanged by the people of the whole world one day. The same will happen to other U.S. henchmen." The heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel, against the Arab people must be settled; the betrayal of the Arab people by Soviet revisionism must also be severely punished by the Arab people.

The 700 million Chinese people, advancing victoriously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on the side of the Syrian, Egyptian, and Arab peoples, and will, like in the 1956 Suez Canal War, support the Arab people's struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The oppressed peoples and nations cannot rely on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys for their liberation, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." We firmly believe that the Arab people, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will surely be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackey, Israel, as long as they strengthen unity and persist in struggle.

U.S. imperialism will surely be defeated, and victory will surely belong to the heroic Arab people.

### 胜利一定属于英雄的阿拉伯人民

    我国各人民团体联合声明谴责美帝和以色列对阿拉伯国家的挑衅
    胜利一定属于英雄的阿拉伯人民
    苏修充当美帝帮凶出卖阿拉伯人民决不会有好下场
    新华社二十八日讯　中国亚非团结委员会等九个团体今天发表联合声明，表示坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的正义斗争。联合声明全文如下：
    中国人民以极其愤慨的心情，注视着美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列在中东地区所施展的侵略大阴谋。中国人民完全拥护我国政府五月二十七日的声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗对阿拉伯国家的战争挑衅，坚决支持叙利亚、阿联和阿拉伯各国人民为粉碎这一大阴谋而进行的正义斗争。
    美帝国主义的工具以色列，在以叙、以阿（联）边境集结大量部队，准备发动大规模的武装挑衅，并且公然叫嚣要使用武力。美国第六舰队也开入东地中海，进行军事恫吓。美帝还勾结苏英法和利用它的御用工具联合国，为其侵略阴谋效劳。阿拉伯各国的独立和安全受到了严重的威胁。美帝国主义是怂恿以色列对阿拉伯各国进行侵略的罪魁祸首。
    阿拉伯人民是伟大的英雄的人民。面对美帝国主义和以色列的战争挑衅，叙利亚、阿联和阿拉伯各国人民，同仇敌忾，枕戈待旦，随时准备痛击侵略者。阿联已断然拒绝美国五项蛮横要求，勒令联合国紧急部队撤离加沙地区和阿联领土，并宣布封锁亚喀巴湾。叙利亚和阿联人民的斗争，得到阿拉伯各国人民的大力支持。阿拉伯人民的这种决心和行动，好得很！它大灭美帝国主义及其走狗的威风，大长一切被压迫人民的斗志！
    苏联修正主义领导集团积极推销所谓“塔什干精神”，妄图迫使阿拉伯人民放弃自卫反击的正义斗争，向美帝国主义及其走狗以色列屈膝投降。苏修领导集团所扮演的角色，又一次暴露了它是美帝的头号帮凶。
    但是，不管美帝国主义及其帮凶如何猖獗，他们是绝对不会有好下场的。正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席所说：“美国垄断资本集团如果坚持推行它的侵略政策和战争政策，势必有一天要被全世界人民处以绞刑。其他美国帮凶也将是这样。”美帝国主义及其走狗以色列对阿拉伯人民犯下的滔天罪行，一定要清算；苏联修正主义对阿拉伯人民的出卖，也一定要受到阿拉伯人民的严厉惩罚。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中胜利前进的七亿中国人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定地站在叙利亚、阿联和阿拉伯各国人民一边，并将象一九五六年苏伊士运河战争时期支持埃及那样，来支持阿拉伯人民反对美帝及其侵略工具以色列的斗争。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”我们坚信，具有反帝斗争传统的阿拉伯人民，只要加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够打败美帝国主义及其走狗以色列。
    美帝国主义必败，胜利一定属于英雄的阿拉伯人民。
