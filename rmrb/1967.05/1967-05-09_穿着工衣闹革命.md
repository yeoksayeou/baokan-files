Wearing Work Clothes to Make Revolution

“Wearing work clothes to make revolution.”

This is the battle cry of the proletarian revolutionary factions of the Beijing Jade Factory, and it is their new revolutionary action after taking power.

“Wearing work clothes to make revolution” is a response to the phenomenon of too many full-time members in revolutionary organizations at that time. Under the call of this slogan, more than sixty full-time members of various revolutionary organizations returned to the workshop to promote revolution and production, promoting the dual development of revolution and production.

Victory Afterward

After the revolutionary organizations of the Beijing Jade Factory achieved decisive victories in the power struggle, they heard a chorus of praise. The revolutionary comrades were delighted, thinking: We were the ones who first exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory. We smashed the bourgeois reactionary line. We removed the “counter-revolutionary” hats from the revolutionary masses. In short, we have done a lot for the masses.

In this state of self-satisfaction, various revolutionary organizations were busy setting up their own offices, finding furniture, installing telephones, and hanging signs. Some comrades took off their work clothes and settled into their offices.

Someone criticized the leaders of the revolutionary organizations, and they first asked, “Is our overall direction correct?”

The person replied, “Yes.”

They then said, “As long as the overall direction is correct, there’s no need to quibble over minor issues.”

In this way, their contact with the masses decreased, and signs of alienation from the masses began to appear.

At this time, some unusual phenomena in the factory sounded the alarm for them: Why were some people with ulterior motives shouting and criticizing one revolutionary organization while praising another, forming factions and attacking each other? Why did some old workers no longer smile? The leaders of the revolutionary organizations decided to leave their offices and go to the workshops to listen to the opinions of the masses.

Reflecting on the Past

During a conversation with the leaders of the revolutionary organizations, old worker Zhang Yugang bluntly told them, “Your overall direction in the past was correct, and your achievements are in the hearts of the masses. No one can erase them. But achievements can only prove that you have made revolution in the past. Now, if you only see your own merits, set up signs everywhere, and do not continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and become detached from the masses, you will lose your direction!” Some workers said, “In the past, you were beaten as ‘counter-revolutionaries’ for exposing the capitalist-roaders within the party in the factory. Now that we proletarian revolutionaries are in power, you have forgotten the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. This is forgetting the bigger picture. This way, there is a danger of being beaten as ‘counter-revolutionaries’ again. You should think about the past!”

Thinking of the past, a series of thrilling battle scenes came to mind. It was the early days of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party proposed and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. At that time, the factory was shrouded in white terror. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory, to cover up their crimes, confuse right and wrong, and reverse black and white, forcibly labeled the revolutionary mass organizations as “counter-revolutionary organizations.”

At the height of the struggle, the proletarian revolutionary factions did not eat or sleep, never slackened in studying Chairman Mao’s works. When they were beaten as “counter-revolutionaries” and attacked, they remembered Chairman Mao’s teachings: “When the sky is overcast, we point out: this is only a temporary phenomenon, darkness is about to pass, and dawn is just ahead.” The invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave them boundless fighting strength.

When they were still in the minority, the old workers of the factory stood up and formed the “Old Workers’ Combat Team,” standing firmly with them and fighting side by side. Led by the old workers, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory rose up, making the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party’s factory drown in the vast ocean of the masses’ struggle. They deeply felt: “What is the real iron wall? It is the masses, the tens of millions of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries.”

Reflecting on the past, they realized: After victory, the study of Chairman Mao’s works was not tight, they had detached themselves from production, sat in offices, and did not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, thus becoming alienated from the masses.

In response to these problems, they strove to study Chairman Mao’s teachings on the mass line. At the same time, they continued to go deep into the masses, sincerely making self-criticisms to the masses, and asking the masses to boldly offer opinions. Old worker Wang Zhongyuan spoke earnestly, “In the past, we old comrades saw that your overall direction was correct, and we firmly supported you. Now that we proletarian revolutionaries are in power, we must never detach ourselves from the masses. Without the support of the masses, the seal will have no authority.” He excitedly said, “I see that there are such revolutionary successors, and I feel that our country will not change color. My vision has brightened. But seeing some of you detach yourselves from the masses, I am worried that our factory’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be half-hearted, and my heart aches.”

The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought illuminated their path, and the heartfelt words of the old workers moved them. They began to realize: Victory is severely testing them. After the proletarian revolutionary factions took power, would they follow Chairman Mao’s teachings, closely connect with the masses, and actively participate in labor, or would they be high above, detached from production and the masses? They loudly answered: “We must never overthrow the landlord to become a young master, overthrow the emperor to become the emperor.” “We will wear work clothes to make revolution, forever beating in unison with the broad revolutionary masses.” They seriously studied the “Three Articles,” “Opposing Libertarianism,” and “On Rectifying the Party’s Erroneous Thoughts,” conducted rectification, broke down selfishness and established public-mindedness, and smashed anarchism, factionalism, cliquism, and individualism. The newly established offices were automatically dismantled, and more than sixty full-time members of various revolutionary organizations returned to the workshops.

Marching Forward Bravely

Wearing work clothes to make revolution promoted the great unity of various revolutionary organizations. In the past, the obstacle to unity was the private thoughts in the minds of some leaders of the revolutionary organizations. Now, as soon as they returned to the workshops, they quickly discovered that the same content meetings had to be held according to each organization’s system; the same tasks also had to be assigned according to each organization’s system; the problems existing in the workshops could only be solved through each organization’s system. Since the overall direction of various revolutionary organizations was the same, was it necessary to do things differently in specific work? Thus, the “Star Fire Brigade,” “Red Flag Brigade,” and “Head Start Combat Team” all disbanded their headquarters and established a factory-wide revolutionary organization—the “June 23 Brigade.”

The leaders of the revolutionary organizations returned to the workshops, and many full-time masses followed suit. The production order disrupted by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party was quickly restored, and the output value increased significantly. Revolutionary workers saw the excellent situation in the entire factory and praised them, saying, “You are not only pioneers in making revolution but also experts in production.”

In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Beijing Jade Factory began innovative activities. The proletarian revolutionary comrades followed Chairman Mao’s teachings that literature and art should serve the revolution and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, took the mass line, mobilized old workers, young workers, and technical personnel to combine forces, and boldly broke old traditions and established new ones. Products reflecting the “Four Olds” such as emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties stopped production, and a large number of new theme jade artworks were produced. Works like “Red Guards’ Long March,” “African Storm,” “Anti-Revisionist Fighter,” “Drilling Team 3211,” and “Cai Yongxiang” were all very successful, radiating the brilliance of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

### 穿着工衣闹革命

    穿着工衣闹革命
    “穿着工衣闹革命”。
    这是北京玉器厂的无产阶级革命派提出的战斗口号，是他们掌权后采取的新的革命行动。
      “穿着工衣闹革命”，是针对当时革命组织脱产人员过多的现象提出来的。在这个口号的号召下，各革命组织的脱产人员六十多人回到车间抓革命促生产，促进了革命和生产双发展。
                          胜利以后
    北京玉器厂的各革命组织，在夺权斗争取得决定性的胜利以后，听到的是一片赞扬声。革命派同志心里也乐滋滋的，他们想：厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是我们带头揪出来的，资产阶级反动路线是被我们粉碎的，革命群众的“反革命”帽子是我们给摘掉的。一句话，为群众做的事不少了。
    就在这种自满自足的情况下，各革命组织忙着设立自己的办公室，找家具，安电话，挂牌子。有的同志脱下工作服，蹲起办公室来。
    有人对革命组织负责人提出批评，他们就先问人家：“我们大方向对不对？”
    人家说：“对！”
    他们就说：“大方向对就行了，别纠缠枝节问题。”
    这样，他们和群众的联系少了，出现了和群众疏远的苗头。
    就在这时候，厂里的一些反常现象，给他们敲响了警钟：为什么一些别有用心的人在这时候大嚷大叫起来，赞扬这个革命组织，指责另一个革命组织，拉一派、打一派？为什么有些老工人脸上的笑容看不见了？各革命组织的负责人决定走出办公室，深入车间去听取群众的意见。
                         想想过去
    老工人张玉庚在一次和革命组织的负责人谈心时，不客气地对他们说：“你们过去的大方向是正确的，成绩摆在群众的心里，谁也抹煞不了。但是成绩只能说明你们过去革命，现在你们要是只看到自己的功劳，到处树自己的牌子，而不继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，脱离群众，可就要迷失大方向呵！”有的工人说：“过去你们为了把厂里党内走资本主义道路的当权派拉下马，被打成‘反革命’。现在我们无产阶级革命派掌权了，你们却忘了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这是忘了大局。这样就还有第二次被打成‘反革命’的危险，你们要好好想想过去！”
    提起过去，一幅幅惊心动魄的斗争场面又浮上了脑海。那是无产阶级文化大革命的初期，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，提出并推行了资产阶级反动路线。当时，白色恐怖笼罩全厂。厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了掩盖自己的罪行，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，硬把“反革命组织”的帽子扣在革命群众组织的头上。
    在斗争最尖锐的时候，无产阶级革命派饭不吃，觉不睡，一刻也不放松学习毛主席著作，当他们被打成“反革命”，遭到围攻的时候，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“当着天空出现乌云的时候，我们就指出：这不过是暂时的现象，黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了他们无穷的战斗力量。
    当他们还是处于少数的时候，厂里的老工人挺身而出，成立了“老工人战斗队”和他们紧紧地站在一起，并肩战斗。在老工人的带动下，全厂广大革命职工纷纷起来，使厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派陷在群众斗争的汪洋大海之中。他们深深体会到：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    想起过去，他们意识到：胜利以后，学习毛主席著作抓得不紧，又脱离了生产，坐进了办公室，听取群众意见不虚心，因此，和群众疏远了。
    针对这些问题，他们努力学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导。同时，继续深入到群众中去，诚恳地向群众作自我批评，请群众大胆提意见。老工人王仲元语重心长地说：“过去，我们老一辈看到你们的大方向是正确的，坚决起来支持了你们。现在我们无产阶级革命派掌权了，可千万不能脱离群众，失去了群众的拥护，大印也就没有权威了”。他激动地说：“我看到有了你们这样一代革命接班人，觉得我们的国家不会变颜色了，我的眼前豁亮了。但是，看到你们有些人脱离群众，我就担心我们厂的无产阶级文化大革命有半途而废的危险，我的心也疼。”
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想照亮了他们的路，老工人感人肺腑的谈话打动了他们的心。他们开始认识到：胜利在严峻地考验着自己。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，是按照毛主席教导，紧密联系群众，积极参加劳动，还是高高在上，脱离生产，脱离群众呢？他们响亮地回答：“我们绝不能打倒老爷出少爷，打倒皇帝坐皇帝”。“我们要穿着工衣闹革命，永远和广大革命群众的脉搏一起跳动。”他们认真学习“老三篇”、《反对自由主义》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，进行整风，破私立公，打倒无政府主义、山头主义、小团体主义、个人主义。刚刚建立起来的摊子自动拆掉了，各革命组织的脱产人员，有六十多人回到了车间。
                           奋勇前进
    穿着工衣闹革命，促进了各革命组织的大联合。过去之所以联合不起来，障碍在于革命组织一些负责人头脑中的私心杂念。现在，他们一回到车间，很快发现，同样内容的会，却要按各组织系统开；同样的任务，也要按各组织系统分配；车间里存在的一些问题，只有通过各组织系统才能解决。既然各革命组织的大方向是一致的，有什么必要在具体工作上这样各搞一套呢？于是，“星火兵团”、“红旗兵团”和“从头越战斗队”，都取消了自己的总部，建立了全厂性的革命组织——“六·二三兵团”。
    革命组织的负责人回车间了，许多脱产的群众也跟着回来了。被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏的生产秩序很快地恢复了，产值也大幅度增长。革命职工看到全厂出现的大好形势，称赞他们说：“你们不但是闹革命的闯将，也是抓生产的能手。”
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，北京玉器厂开始了创新的活动。无产阶级革命派的同志们遵照毛主席文学艺术要为革命服务、为工农兵服务的教导，走群众路线，发动老工人、青年工人和技术人员结合起来，大胆破旧立新。反映“四旧”的帝王将相、才子佳人等产品停止生产了，一大批新题材的玉器工艺品生产出来了。象“红卫兵大串连”、“非洲风暴”、“反修战士”、“三二一一一钻井队”、“蔡永祥”等等一些大型作品，都塑造得非常成功，放射出了伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。
