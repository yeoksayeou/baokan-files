In the midst of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, we celebrate the first anniversary of the issuance of the "May 7th Directive" by our great leader Chairman Mao. Combining the rich practice of the Cultural Revolution over the past year, we revisit Chairman Mao's great call, feeling deeply inspired and intimately connected.

Our People's Liberation Army is a proletarian revolutionary army personally created and nurtured by our great leader Chairman Mao. Since Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms and our Vice Chairman, took charge of the Military Commission, the entire army has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, emphasized proletarian politics, adhered to the Four Firsts, carried forward the Three-Eight Style, participated in and supported the socialist education movement and socialist construction. This has made our army advance rapidly on the road of revolutionization, cultivating tens of thousands of new-type communist warriors represented by Lei Feng, Ouyang Hai, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and Cai Yongxiang.

After the issuance of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," under the personal leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, we have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's wise decisions, actively participated in the struggle to criticize the bourgeoisie, and actively carried out support for the left, support for industry, support for agriculture, military management, and military training. In practice, we have combined military affairs with education, agriculture, industry, and the masses. Our units, in the "Five Supports," have worked together with the revolutionary masses in the localities, learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, exchanging advanced experiences, supporting the localities, and greatly promoting the proletarian revolutionization of the army. This has played a tremendous role in truly making our army a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Implementing the "May 7th Directive," combining military affairs with education, agriculture, industry, and the masses, and making the army a great school of Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental measure for cultivating new communist people with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the science of revolution and the science of struggle. Our practice over the past year fully proves that to master Mao Zedong Thought, one must execute Chairman Mao's directives, place oneself in the midst of the people's struggle, learn in the struggle, and apply in the struggle. This is the fastest and most effective way to learn Mao Zedong Thought.

Since the Cultural Revolution, our units have achieved great harvests in learning and applying Chairman Mao's works in criticizing the bourgeoisie and supporting the left, industry, agriculture, military management, and military training. In the midst of the people's struggle, we have been able to learn quickly and well because, first, there is the class struggle, the best classroom, which greatly increases our sensory knowledge; second, there are the people, the best teachers, from whom we have learned many good ideas, good styles, good experiences, and good methods; third, there is the method of combining learning with application, which combines learning Mao Zedong Thought, implementing Mao Zedong Thought, propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and combining the transformation of the objective world with the transformation of the subjective world. In the people's struggle, we encounter new problems every day, learn every day, practice every day, and improve every day. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the worker and peasant masses to truly learn it." The facts have repeatedly proven that this is an absolute truth.

New communist people should be people who serve the people wholeheartedly. Such people can only be cultivated and tempered in the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, among the people. If one follows the bourgeois "cultivation" methods advocated by the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, one can only cultivate individualists, bourgeois elements who ride on the backs of the people to be officials and lords, and Khrushchev-like figures.

New communist people should be people who are both literate and martial, who can engage in both physical and mental labor. Such people cannot be cultivated without participating in the three great revolutionary movements. Only by following the "May 7th Directive," combining military affairs with education, agriculture, industry, and the masses, can such people be cultivated. Since last year's Cultural Revolution, participating in the criticism of the bourgeoisie and the "Five Supports" work has greatly improved our political, ideological, and theoretical cultural levels, as well as our production knowledge. This shows that as long as we resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and persist in making our army a true great school of Mao Zedong Thought and a great school of communism, we will gradually eliminate the three great differences, making each of us a new communist person who can adapt to the needs of the revolution at any time, who can work with a hammer, farm with a hoe, fight with a gun, and criticize the bourgeoisie with a pen.

Whether in the countryside or in the factories, everywhere is a great classroom for the People's Liberation Army to study Mao Zedong Thought. A propaganda team from a certain unit assists coal miners in setting up large Mao Zedong Quotations boards and learns and applies Chairman Mao's works with the workers.

    锤炼无产阶级新型战士的大熔炉
    海空雄鹰团飞行员
    战斗英雄　舒积成  一等功臣　高翔
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，我们来庆祝伟大领袖毛主席发出“五·七”指示一周年。结合着一年来无产阶级文化大革命的丰富实践，重温毛主席的伟大号召，深受鼓舞，倍感亲切。
    我们人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和培养的无产阶级革命军队。自从毛主席的亲密战友、我们的副统帅林副主席主持军委工作以后，全军上下高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大力突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，发扬三八作风，参加和支援社会主义教育运动和社会主义建设，使我军在革命化的道路上飞跃前进，培养出了以雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、刘英俊、蔡永祥等为代表的成千上万的共产主义新型战士。
    毛主席“五·七”指示发表以后，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们又在林副主席的亲自领导下，坚决贯彻执行了毛主席的英明决策，积极参加了批判资产阶级的斗争，积极进行支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等工作，在实践中把军学、军农、军工、军民这几项兼起来了。我们部队在“五支”中同地方上的革命群众一道，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，相互交流先进经验，既支援了地方，又大大促进了军队的无产阶级革命化，对真正把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校，起了巨大的推动作用。
    贯彻“五·七”指示，把军学、军农、军工、军民都兼起来，把军队办成毛泽东思想的大学校，是用毛泽东思想培养共产主义新人的最根本的措施。毛泽东思想是革命的科学，斗争的科学。我们一年来的实践充分证明，要掌握毛泽东思想，必须执行毛主席的指示，置身于群众斗争的大风大浪中，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，才能最迅速最有效地把毛泽东思想学到手。
    无产阶级文化大革命以来，我们部队在批判资产阶级和支左、支工、支农、军管、军训等项工作中，活学活用毛主席著作获得了大丰收。在群众斗争的大风雨中，所以能够学得快，学得好，一是由于有阶级斗争这个最好的课堂，大大地增长了感性知识；二是由于有人民群众这个最好的教师，向他们学到了很多好思想、好作风、好经验、好方法；三是由于有学用结合这个最好的方法，把学习毛泽东思想、贯彻毛泽东思想、宣传毛泽东思想、捍卫毛泽东思想，很好地结合起来，把改造客观世界和改造主观世界很好地结合起来。在群众斗争中，天天遇到新问题，天天在学习，天天在实践，天天在提高。毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”事实一再证明，这是千真万确的真理。
    共产主义新人，应当是全心全意为人民服务的新人。这样的新人，只能在毛泽东思想的大学校里，用毛泽东思想为武器，到人民群众之中去培养，去磨炼。如果照党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派提倡的那一套搞资产阶级“修养”方法去“修养”，只能“修养”出个人主义者，“修养”出骑在人民头上做官当老爷的资产阶级分子，“修养”出赫鲁晓夫式的人物。
    共产主义新人，应当是能文能武，既会体力劳动又会脑力劳动的新人。这样的新人，也决不是脱离三大革命运动所能培养出来的。只有按照“五·七”指示，把我军办成毛泽东思想的大学校，把军学、军农、军工、军民这几项兼起来，才能培养出这样的新人。去年文化大革命以来，参加批判资产阶级，参加“五支”工作，使我们政治思想和理论文化水平、生产知识都得到很大的提高。这都说明，只要我们坚决按照毛主席的教导长期做下去，把我军真正办成毛泽东思想大学校，办成共产主义大学校，就会逐步消灭三大差别，使我们每一个人都成为能够随时适应革命的需要，拿起铁锤能作工，拿起锄头能种田，拿起枪杆能打仗，拿起笔杆能批判资产阶级的一代共产主义新人。（附图片）
    不论在农村，在工厂，到处都是人民解放军学习毛泽东思想的大课堂。某部毛泽东思想宣传队，协助煤矿工人大办毛主席语录板，和工人一起活学活用毛主席著作。
