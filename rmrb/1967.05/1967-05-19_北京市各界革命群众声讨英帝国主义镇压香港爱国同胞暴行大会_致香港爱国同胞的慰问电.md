The revolutionary masses of various sectors in the capital of our great motherland, after three consecutive days of massive rallies and demonstrations, solemnly gathered today to angrily denounce the fascist atrocities committed by the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong in their bloody suppression of Chinese compatriots! We salute the broad masses of patriots who, under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are bravely fighting against the persecution of the British authorities in Hong Kong, and extend to you our warmest greetings!

We firmly support the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 15. This statement expresses the resolve of 700 million Chinese people to be the steadfast backbone of the patriots in Hong Kong, is a resounding blow to the mad provocations of the British authorities in Hong Kong, and is a firm support for the just struggle of the patriots in Hong Kong.

The series of atrocities that have recently occurred in Hong Kong are entirely the making of the British authorities in Hong Kong. They are part of their conspiracy with the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang bandits to oppose the Chinese people, and are a counter-revolutionary measure they desperately hope to use violence to suppress the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

For a long time, the British authorities in Hong Kong have colluded with the Kuomintang bandits, using Hong Kong to carry out their "two Chinas" conspiracy, sending spies to the Chinese mainland to engage in sabotage, seriously endangering our national security. In this bloody suppression, they have again used Kuomintang spies and recruited the dregs of society as their henchmen to persecute the patriots in Hong Kong. The patriots in Hong Kong are our flesh and blood, our brothers and sisters. The persecution of the patriots in Hong Kong by British imperialism is also the persecution of us. We must resolutely counterattack against such arrogant provocations by British imperialism.

For a long time, British imperialism has colluded with U.S. imperialism, working together to carry out their despicable schemes against the Chinese people. In particular, in recent years, British imperialism, in order to cooperate with U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam, has joined forces with U.S. imperialism to strengthen their military deployment to encircle China, daring to ignore the repeated solemn warnings of the Chinese government and continuing to use Hong Kong as a transit station and base for the U.S. war of aggression in Vietnam. British imperialism dares to be the enemy of 700 million Chinese people and act as a henchman of U.S. imperialism, the result of which can only be "lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet."

For more than a hundred years, the patriots in Hong Kong have always stood at the forefront of the struggle against British imperialism. In this struggle against persecution, you have even more bravely raised the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "resolved to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." You have shown great courage and tenacity, fully carrying forward the glorious tradition of anti-imperialism and patriotism, and are truly outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. It is people, not things, that determine the course of events. The people are the makers of world history."

Dear patriots in Hong Kong! Your struggle is not isolated. Our great motherland is your steadfast backbone. The people of the motherland are carrying out an unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution that is shaking the world, and we are uprooting the main base of revisionism and overthrowing, smashing, and exposing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road! Under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we have already achieved great victories and will continue to achieve even greater victories. Our great victories have dealt a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Our great victories are the strongest and most powerful support for your struggle.

Dear patriots in Hong Kong! Our motherland has never been as strong and consolidated, as vigorous and flourishing as it is today! All this is because we have the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. The Chinese people, including the patriots in Hong Kong, love Chairman Mao and eagerly seek to study Chairman Mao's works. This is a natural and inevitable thing that no one can obstruct or suppress! As long as we hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we will surely be able to "sweep away all harmful pests and have no enemies."

Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong!

Salute to the heroic patriots in Hong Kong who are fighting bravely!

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Down with British imperialism!

Down with Soviet modern revisionism!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    北京市各界革命群众声讨英帝国主义镇压香港爱国同胞暴行大会
    致香港爱国同胞的慰问电
    亲爱的香港爱国同胞们：
    我们伟大祖国首都的各界革命群众在连续三天声势浩大的游行示威之后，今天庄严集会，愤怒声讨英国政府和香港英国当局血腥镇压中国同胞的法西斯暴行！我们向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同香港英国当局进行英勇的反迫害斗争的广大爱国同胞致敬，并向你们致以最亲切的慰问！
    我们坚决拥护我国外交部五月十五日的声明。这个声明表达了七亿中国人民誓作香港爱国同胞坚强后盾的决心，是对香港英国当局疯狂挑衅的迎头痛击，是对香港爱国同胞正义斗争的坚决支持。
    最近在香港发生的一连串暴行，完全是香港英国当局一手制造出来的，是它勾结美帝、蒋匪反对中国人民的阴谋的一部分，是它妄想使用暴力镇压来遏制伟大的毛泽东思想影响扩大的一个反革命措施。
    长期以来，香港英国当局纵容蒋介石匪帮，利用香港搞“两个中国”的阴谋活动，对中国大陆派遣特务进行破坏活动，严重危害我国安全。在这次血腥镇压中，它又利用蒋匪特务，搜罗黑社会渣滓，作为爪牙，迫害香港爱国同胞。香港爱国同胞是全体中国人民的亲骨肉、亲兄弟、亲姊妹，英帝国主义对你们的迫害，也就是对我们的迫害。对于英帝国主义的这种猖狂挑衅，我们必须坚决反击。
    长期以来，英帝国主义同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，勾结在一起，干着反对中国人民的卑鄙勾当。特别是最近几年，英帝国主义为了配合美帝国主义在越南的侵略战争，伙同美帝国主义加强包围中国的军事部署，竟敢漠视中国政府的多次严正警告，一直把香港作为美国侵越战争的中继站和基地。英帝国主义胆敢与七亿中国人民为敌，充当美帝国主义的帮凶，其结果只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    一百多年来，香港的爱国同胞始终站在反对英帝国主义的斗争的前哨。在这次反迫害的斗争中，你们更是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”你们英勇顽强，坚贞不屈，大大发扬了反帝爱国的光荣传统，不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”香港英国当局张牙舞爪，气势汹汹，但是，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民面前，英帝国主义这只纸老虎也是逃不脱最后失败的命运的。
    亲爱的香港爱国同胞们！你们的斗争决不是孤立的。伟大的祖国是你们坚强的后盾。祖国的人民正在进行震撼世界的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我们正在挖掉修正主义的总后台，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下，我们已经取得了伟大的胜利，还要继续取得更大的胜利。我们的伟大胜利沉重地打击了帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派。我们的伟大胜利对你们的斗争是最强大、最有力的支持。
    亲爱的香港爱国同胞们！我们的祖国从来没有象今天这样强大和巩固，这样朝气蓬勃和欣欣向荣！这一切都是因为我们有了光焰无际的毛泽东思想。中国人民，包括香港爱国同胞在内，热爱毛主席，如饥似渴地要求学习毛主席著作，这是天经地义的事，是任何人也阻挡不住，镇压不了的！只要我们更高地举起战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，我们就一定能够“扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”
    强烈抗议香港英国当局的法西斯暴行！
    向英勇斗争的香港爱国同胞致敬！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒英帝国主义！
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！

          一九六七年五月十八日
