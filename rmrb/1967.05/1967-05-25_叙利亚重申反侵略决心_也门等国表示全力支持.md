The Arab people resolutely oppose the aggression of the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel. Syria reaffirms its anti-aggression resolve, and Yemen and other countries pledge full support. The UAR announces the closure of the Gulf of Aqaba and decides to withdraw UN forces from UAR territory and the Gaza Strip.

	Our reporter combines reports: According to Xinhua News Agency, Arab governments and peoples are mobilizing to thwart the U.S. imperialist aggression plot against Syria by the tool of Israel.

	On May 22, Syrian Head of State Nur al-Din al-Atassi, at the emergency conference of the Arab Trade Union International, said that the aggression plot against Syria by imperialists led by the United States, Zionists, and reactionaries was anticipated. The Syrian people are prepared to retaliate.

	Atassi, representing the Syrian people, announced complete support for the UAR government's firm stance on demanding the withdrawal of the "United Nations Emergency Force" from UAR territory and the Gaza region. He said, "We condemn the imperialists, especially U.S. imperialists, for their attempt to keep this force there. We firmly reject the proposal to expand the 'United Nations Emergency Force' within Arab territories and to keep it stationed there, as this is an imperialist plot."

	Atassi also said, "The Palestinian people know how to return to their homes. Armed struggle is the only way. No force can prevent them from exercising their legitimate rights."

	On May 22, UAR President Nasser announced that the UAR would not allow Israeli ships to enter or exit the Gulf of Aqaba. (Note: Most of Israel's oil is transported through the Gulf of Aqaba.) Nasser, speaking at a UAR air force forward command post, said, "Under any circumstances, we will not allow ships flying the Israeli flag to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba. We will not relinquish our rights over our territorial waters; this is our territorial water."

	On May 18, UAR Foreign Minister Riad, in a letter to UN Secretary-General U Thant, announced that the UAR had "decided not to allow the United Nations Emergency Force to continue to be stationed in UAR territory and the Gaza region." The UAR requested that U Thant "take necessary measures to withdraw this force as soon as possible."

	Previously, on May 16, the UAR Armed Forces Chief of Staff Fawzi, on the orders of the UAR Armed Forces Deputy Commander-in-Chief Amer, demanded that the commander of the United Nations Emergency Force, Riikki, withdraw his forces from the UAR territory bordering Israel's ceasefire line, so that all UAR armed forces could "prepare to take immediate action against Israel in the event of any invasion of an Arab country."

	The Arab League held a council meeting on May 20, announcing support for the UAR's sovereignty and recognizing its right to demand the withdrawal of the "United Nations Emergency Force" from UAR territory, so that the UAR could prepare its armed forces to counter Israeli aggression.

	On May 22, Yemeni President Sallal announced a nationwide military mobilization and called on the Yemeni people to join the army to fight against Israel. The Yemeni government issued a statement on May 18 condemning Israel's aggression against Arab countries. The statement said that any aggression by Israel against Syria is a direct aggression against Yemen, and Yemen will use all its strength to counter Zionist aggression.

	On May 20, Iraqi Army Deputy Chief of Staff Sabri led a military delegation to Damascus to discuss countermeasures against Israeli aggression with Syria.

	On May 22, the Lebanese government mobilized military reserves and strengthened its forces along the southern border with Israel. The Lebanese government also decided to send military representatives to Syria and the UAR to coordinate military positions.

	On May 23, the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister in Cairo stated that the Kuwaiti army is prepared to fight Israel on any front.

    叙利亚国家元首努尔丁·阿塔西二十二日在阿拉伯工会国际联合会紧急代表大会上说，以美国为首的帝国主义者、犹太复国主义者和反动派对叙利亚的侵略阴谋是早已预料到的，叙利亚人民准备予以还击。
    阿塔西在会上代表叙利亚人民宣布完全支持阿联政府要求“联合国紧急部队”撤出阿联领土和加沙地区的坚决立场。他说：我们谴责帝国主义者，特别是美帝国主义者要把这支部队留在那里的企图。我们坚决拒绝扩大阿拉伯境内的“联合国紧急部队”和要把它留驻下去的主张，因为这是帝国主义制造的阴谋。
    阿塔西还说：巴勒斯坦人民知道怎样重返他们的家园。武装斗争是唯一的道路。任何力量都不能阻挡他们行使自己的合法权利。
    阿联总统纳赛尔在二十二日宣布，阿联不准以色列船只出入亚喀巴湾。（按：以色列所需的大部分石油都是由亚喀巴湾运进的。）纳赛尔在阿联的一个空军前沿总部讲话时说：在任何情况下，我们不准持有以色列旗帜的船只通过亚喀巴湾，我们决不割让我们对领水的权利，这是我们的领水。
    阿联外交部长里亚德十八日在给联合国秘书长吴丹的信件中宣布，阿联“已经决定不让联合国紧急部队继续驻在阿联领土和加沙地区”。阿联要求吴丹“采取必要措施，使这支部队尽早撤出”。
    在此之前，十六日，阿联武装部队参谋长法齐奉阿联武装部队最高副司令阿密尔的命令，要求联合国紧急部队司令里基把他的部队从阿联领土同以色列交界的停战线一带撤退，以便使所有阿联武装部队“做好准备，在以色列侵略任何一个阿拉伯国家时立即对以色列采取行动。”
    阿拉伯联盟于二十日举行理事会会议，会后宣布支持阿联的主权，认为它有权要求撤走在阿联境内的“联合国紧急部队”，以便阿联使其武装部队作好反击以色列侵略的准备。
    也门总统萨拉勒在二十二日宣布全国武装部队总动员，并号召也门人民参加军队，以便对以色列进行战斗。也门政府在十八日发表声明，谴责以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略。声明说，以色列对叙利亚的任何侵略都是对也门的直接侵略，也门将尽一切力量来对付犹太复国主义的侵略。
    伊拉克陆军助理参谋长萨布里二十日率领军事代表团到达大马士革，同叙利亚讨论对付以色列侵略的问题。
    黎巴嫩政府在二十二日动员了军事后备人员，并加强了同以色列接壤的南部边境的兵力。黎巴嫩政府还决定派军事代表去叙利亚和阿联协调有关方面的军事立场。
    科威特外交部长二十三日在开罗表示，科威特军队准备在任何一条战线上同以色列进行战斗。
