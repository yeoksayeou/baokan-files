The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has severely punished the American aggressors by intensifying fierce attacks and containment operations south of the demilitarized zone.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi on May 22, since the U.S. Marine Corps brazenly invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone in Vietnam on May 18, the South Vietnamese Liberation Forces have launched fierce attacks on the U.S. aggressors in the areas south of the demilitarized zone, striking heavily at key bases and moving units of the U.S. Marine Corps, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy.

It is reported that on the night of May 21, the Liberation Forces launched a 15-minute concentrated artillery barrage on the Dong Ha base, the headquarters of the forward units of the U.S. Marine Corps' 3rd Division. The rain of shells hit the helicopter landing area and nearby U.S. Air Force camp within the base, which is a crucial supply route for the forward units of the U.S. Marine Corps. The shells also hit the power plant and a fuel storage area within the base, causing a large fire. Under the cover of artillery fire, the Liberation Forces also attacked a U.S. military officer's quarters, killing and wounding many enemy personnel.

Earlier, on the morning of May 18, the Liberation Forces also launched a fierce artillery barrage on this base. According to reports, the first volley of shells hit the command post of the 9th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps and its radar and communication equipment. Following that, more concentrated artillery fire destroyed the enemy's artillery positions, leaving the enemy in disarray. The enemy's cannons were silenced in an instant, not even managing to fire a single shell. The shells fired by the Liberation Forces also hit the command post of the 3rd Division of the U.S. Marine Corps, its radar and communication center, fuel depot, ammunition depot, and other facilities, causing large fires within the base. At the same time, the Liberation Forces also launched concentrated artillery barrages on the U.S. Marine Corps' positions at Kun Tian, Yu Si, and Hill 241.

The Liberation Forces have been attacking the enemy everywhere in the areas south of the demilitarized zone, tying down the enemy's actions. On the morning of May 18, the Liberation Forces ambushed two battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps and one battalion of the puppet army in the northwest of Yu Ling County, killing 450 enemy personnel and wounding many more. Simultaneously, local forces and guerrillas in Yu Ling County also launched a fierce attack on another U.S. invading force in the eastern part of the county, killing and wounding nearly 200 enemy personnel.

On the morning of May 20, the Liberation Forces suddenly attacked several battalions of puppet troops and a tank unit east of Quang Tri City, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

Due to the U.S. aggressors transferring large numbers of U.S. troops from the central and southern battlefields of South Vietnam to the areas south of the demilitarized zone, the Liberation Forces in the central and southern regions have launched even more fierce attacks and ambushes on the enemy in recent days, leaving the enemy in a more difficult and desperate situation. According to reports, on May 21, the Liberation Forces in the Saigon region engaged in a 15-minute decisive battle about 40 kilometers east of Saigon, annihilating an armored convoy of the U.S. invading forces. When this armored unit was moving along the road and entered the ambush zone, the brave soldiers of the Liberation Forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy vehicles with mortars and recoilless rifles at a distance of about 20 meters. In a few minutes, they completely destroyed and damaged this convoy, which included one M-48 tank and three armored personnel carriers, totaling eight vehicles. The enemy personnel on the vehicles fled in disarray and were also heavily attacked by the soldiers of the Liberation Forces. Of the 47 enemy personnel in this armored unit, all except three were killed or wounded.

    南越解放军严惩美国侵略者
    在非军事区以南加紧猛烈袭击和牵制活动
    据新华社河内二十二日电　自美国海军陆战队十八日悍然侵入越南非军事区南部以后，越南南方解放武装力量在非军事区以南地区狠狠地痛击美国侵略军，猛烈袭击美国海军陆战队的重要基地和调动中的部队，给予敌人以沉重打击。
    据报道，解放武装力量二十一日夜间对美国海军陆战队第三师前沿部队司令部所在地的东河基地，进行了十五分钟的密集炮火的炮击。雨点般的炮弹击中了这个基地内的直升飞机着陆地区及其附近的美国空军营地，这个着陆地区是美国海军陆战队前沿部队运输供应物资的一条重要孔道。炮弹还击中了基地内的发电厂和一个汽油储存区，引起了大火。在炮火的掩护下，解放武装力量还袭击了一个美国军官宿舍，打死打伤很多敌人。
    在这以前，解放武装力量十八日凌晨也对这个基地进行了猛烈的炮击。据报道，第一阵炮弹击中了美国海军陆战队第九团的指挥所和雷达、通讯联络设备。接着，更密集的炮火摧毁了敌军的炮兵阵地，打得敌人懵头转向。敌人的大炮顷刻间变成哑吧，连一发炮弹都来不及发出去。解放武装力量发出的炮弹还命中了美国海军陆战队第三师的指挥部和雷达、通讯联络中心、汽油库、弹药库等，在基地内引起了大火。与此同时，解放武装力量还对美国海军陆战队的昆天、育庙和二四一高地的据点进行了密集的炮击。
    解放武装力量在非军事区以南地区到处袭击敌人，牵制敌人的行动。十八日上午，解放武装力量在犹灵县西北袭击了美军海军陆战队两个营和伪军一个营，打死美伪军四百五十名，打伤很多敌军。同时，犹灵县的地方部队和游击队也在这个县的东部给予另一支美国侵略军以猛烈的打击，打死打伤敌人近二百名。
    二十日上午，解放武装力量又在广治市以东突然袭击了几个营的伪军和一支坦克部队，给予敌人很大的杀伤。
    由于美国侵略者从南越中部和南部战场把大量美军调到非军事区以南地区，中部和南部解放武装力量这几天来对敌人进行更加猛烈的袭击和伏击，打得敌人捉襟见肘，陷于更加困难的境地。据报道，西贡地区的解放武装力量二十一日白天在西贡以东四十公里的地方，经过十五分钟的速决战，就消灭了美国侵略军的一支装甲车队。当这支在公路上行进的装甲部队进入伏击圈时，英勇的解放武装力量的战士们在大约二十米的近距离内用迫击炮和无后座力炮对敌人的车辆发起了猛烈的攻击，在几分钟内全部击毁击伤了这支包括一辆M—48型坦克、三辆装甲运输车在内的八辆军车。车上的敌人狼狈逃命，也遭到了解放武装力量战士们的大力杀伤。这支装甲部队四十七名敌人，除三人外，全部被打死打伤。
