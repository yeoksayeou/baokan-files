The editorial board of the *People's Liberation Army Daily* comments: The certain regiment of the Qinghai garrison has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, maintained a firm stance, clearly defined their position, and wholeheartedly supported leftist organizations. They have accumulated good experiences, which are worth serious study by everyone.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clearly defined." Support-left troops must be bold, correctly identify revolutionary leftist organizations, firmly stand on the side of the revolutionary leftists, and resolutely support them. They must not be hesitant or indecisive.

Support-left troops clearly expressing support for revolutionary leftist organizations may face attacks and criticism from conservative organizations. The more such situations arise, the more they must maintain a firm stance and not waver.

For the masses in conservative organizations who have been deceived, they should follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "not looking down on them, but approaching them, uniting with them, persuading them, and encouraging them to advance." They should do meticulous political and ideological work, clearly point out their major errors, actively help them correct their mistakes, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Not only should the comrades in the troops actively do ideological work for the deceived masses, but they should also mobilize comrades from the revolutionary factions to do the same. Only in this way can they effectively support the leftists, continuously expand the leftist ranks, and do a good job in supporting the left.

The officers and soldiers of the certain regiment of the Qinghai garrison have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and entered the Dawn Chemical Factory and other units to carry out support-left tasks. They actively helped the revolutionary masses study and apply Chairman Mao's works, started from class education, mobilized the masses, and seriously implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy. They maintained a firm stance, clearly defined their position, and wholeheartedly supported the leftist masses. They educated and won over the deceived masses, expanded the leftist ranks, established a good revolutionary order, and promoted production.

Their experiences from supporting the left are as follows:

The most fundamental thing is to arm the broad masses with Mao Zedong Thought

After the support-left troops entered the factory, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres had great trust in the troops, and they wanted the troops to solve all kinds of problems. The troops had many things to manage and once fell into a bureaucratic cycle, making their work passive. To change this situation, the troops repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and Lin Biao's instructions on insisting on the "Four Firsts." They realized that there are many things to do in supporting the left, but the most fundamental thing is to arm the broad workers and revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought and turn the factory into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought. The support-left troops raised their awareness and put studying Chairman Mao's works first. When investigating and understanding the situation, they first found out about the factory's study of Chairman Mao's works; when arranging work, they first arranged for the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works; when holding meetings, they first led everyone to study Chairman Mao's quotations. The masses' enthusiasm for actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works surged, which not only freed the support-left work from a chaotic situation but also greatly mobilized the workers' revolutionary enthusiasm, making the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" their conscious action.

Previously, these factories had workers from three different regions who did not get along well with each other, and the saying "three sets of horses each going their own way" was popular. Now everyone reflects: "The army has brought us Mao Zedong Thought, and the 'three sets of horses' have now come together on the path of Mao Zedong Thought."

Their specific methods of helping the revolutionary masses actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works are as follows: First, the support-left troops held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and first set an example of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works; second, they helped establish and improve the organization and system for studying Chairman Mao's works; third, they seriously helped the revolutionary factions cultivate activists and tutors for studying Chairman Mao's works and fully played their bridging role; fourth, they organized the troops' cadres into several study guidance groups, went deep into workshops, construction sites, offices, and dormitories, and studied and lectured with the workers, providing specific guidance and spreading study experiences; fifth, they helped the workers seriously study the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" and, in connection with reality, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raising the class consciousness and policy level of revolutionary workers.

Carrying out class education is an effective way to mobilize the masses

Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "class struggle, once grasped, it works," they and the broad revolutionary workers and cadres together extensively carried out class education activities such as recalling bitterness and comparing the past with the present. In class education, the troops and workers recalled bitterness together, closely linking the criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the denunciation and criticism of the heinous crimes of the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the region and unit. At the same time, they guided old workers to connect with the factory's development path in recent years, guided demobilized and transferred soldiers to connect with their growth process in the army, and guided the masses who had been deceived by bad elements to connect with their own lessons. They studied Chairman Mao's discussions on class struggle and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad workers' class consciousness and understanding of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution greatly improved, and some even voluntarily exposed their selfish thoughts and swore in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: They are determined to discard selfish thoughts and, together with the army, care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

To truly mobilize the masses' revolutionary enthusiasm, after recalling bitterness, the troops helped the broad workers carry out the "three brings, three finds, three talks" activity. That is, bringing the problems of the region and unit, finding answers in Chairman Mao's works, and talking about the heavy responsibility of the revolutionary organization; bringing the problem of further promoting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the region and factory, finding answers in Chairman Mao's works, and talking about the current great situation of the cultural revolution; bringing the problems of being persecuted or deceived, finding answers in Chairman Mao's works, and talking about the direction of the movement, thereby further raising the political awareness of the broad revolutionary masses. Many comrades from the revolutionary organization "August 18" said: "In the past, under the white terror created by the bourgeois reactionary line, we were beaten and imprisoned for the revolution; now, we strictly implement the policy, do not beat people, and do not take revenge, which is also for the revolution. If we do not actively make revolution, we will not live up to Chairman Mao's care for us."

Firmly supporting the left can quickly expand the leftist ranks

The troops took a firm stance, clearly defined their position, and unambiguously stood on the side of the "August 18" revolutionary faction. They enthusiastically helped the revolutionary faction study Chairman Mao's works, strengthened their fighting will, raised their confidence in victory, and expanded the revolutionary ranks. For the leaders of conservative organizations, they exposed and isolated them; for the deceived masses within them, they conducted patient education, removed their concerns, and organized them to study the "Resolution of the Gutian Conference," talked with them, and inspired them to draw a clear line between themselves and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, welcoming them to join the "August 18" organization and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Now these factories' conservative organizations are disintegrating one after another, and the "August 18" revolutionary organization is continuously expanding, with a great revolutionary situation.

Firmly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy and boldly liberating revolutionary cadres

The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party pushed the bourgeois reactionary line in cadre issues, which had not been thoroughly criticized and the poison had not been eliminated in these units. The troops, together with the revolutionary mass organizations, studied Chairman Mao's discussions on cadre policy and the relevant comments in the *Red Flag* magazine, deeply criticized the bourgeois reactionary line in cadre issues, and eliminated the reactionary trend of not distinguishing right from wrong and making all those with the word "chief" stand aside. They made everyone able to use class analysis to deal with cadres. At the same time, they helped the leading cadres study Chairman Mao's works, especially study the "Three Old Articles," overcome selfish thoughts such as fear and resentment, and make them dare to stand up for revolution. On the basis of raising the revolutionary masses' and revolutionary cadres' ideological understanding, the troops also conducted detailed investigations and research, sorted out the cadres, and then, through the masses' discussion and the cadres' "coming out," let the revolutionary cadres stand out. Currently, many revolutionary leading cadres have already stood out, and cadres with serious mistakes have also decided to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, make amends in the revolution and production, and make up for their mistakes.

    青海驻军某团总结支左工作经验
    旗帜鲜明　坚决站在革命左派一边  突出政治　做艰苦细致的思想工作
    《解放军报》编者按：青海驻军某团高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，全心全意地支持左派组织。他们积累了很好的经验，值得大家认真学习。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明。”支左部队要“敢”字当头，正确地识别革命左派组织，坚决地站在革命左派一边，坚定不移地支持他们，决不能畏首畏尾，游移不定。
    支左部队明确表示支持革命左派组织，可能会遭到保守组织的围攻、责难。越是在这种情况下，越要立场坚定，决不能因此而脚踩两只船。
    对保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众，应该遵循毛主席“不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进”的教导，对他们作艰苦细致的政治思想工作。明确指出他们大方向的错误，积极帮助他们改正错误，破私立公，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。不仅部队同志要积极做好受蒙蔽群众的思想工作，还要动员革命派的同志也这样做。只有这样，才能有力地支持左派，不断壮大左派队伍，搞好支左工作。
    青海驻军某团干部战士，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进入黎明化工厂等单位执行支左任务。他们积极帮助革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，从阶级教育入手，大力发动群众，认真贯彻毛主席的干部政策，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，全心全意地支持左派群众，教育争取受蒙蔽的群众，壮大了左派队伍，建立了良好的革命秩序，促进了生产。
    他们支左工作中的几点体会是：
    最根本的是用毛泽东思想武装广大群众的头脑
    支左部队进厂后，广大革命群众和革命干部对部队十分信任，什么问题都要找部队同志解决。部队同志要管的事情很多，曾一度陷入了事务圈子，工作被动。为了改变这种状况，部队同志反复学习了毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，学习了林彪副主席关于坚持“四个第一”的指示，认识到支左工作有许多事情要作，但是最根本的是要用毛泽东思想武装广大工人群众和革命干部的头脑，把工厂办成毛泽东思想大学校。支左部队提高了认识，都把搞好毛主席著作的学习放在首位。在调查了解情况时，首先摸清工厂学习毛主席著作的情况；在安排工作时，首先安排活学活用毛主席著作；开会时，首先带领大家学习毛主席语录。工人群众活学活用毛主席著作的热潮掀起来了，这就不仅使支左工作摆脱了忙乱的局面，而且大大调动了工人群众的革命积极性，使“抓革命，促生产”的方针变成了他们的自觉行动。
    过去，这些工厂来自三个不同地区的部分工人，彼此闹不团结，流行着“三套马车各走各的路”的说法。现在大家反映：“解放军给我们送来了毛泽东思想，‘三套马车’已经走到毛泽东思想这一条路上来了。”
    他们帮助革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的具体作法是：第一、支左部队高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，首先作出活学活用毛主席著作的活样子；第二、帮助建立和健全学习毛主席著作的组织和制度；第三、认真帮助革命派培养学习毛主席著作的积极分子和辅导员，充分发挥他们的桥梁作用；第四、把部队干部编成若干学习辅导小组，深入车间、工地、科室、宿舍，和职工一起学习，一起讲用，具体辅导，传播学习经验；第五、帮助职工认真学习“抓革命，促生产”的方针政策，并联系实际活学活用毛主席著作，提高革命职工的阶级觉悟和政策水平。
    大抓阶级教育，是发动群众的有效方法
    遵照毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，他们和广大革命职工和革命干部一起，广泛开展了忆苦思甜、回忆对比等阶级教育活动。在阶级教育中，部队指战员和职工一起忆苦，把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和控诉批判本地区、本单位党内走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行紧密结合起来。同时，引导老工人联系工厂这几年发展的道路，引导复员转业军人联系自己在部队成长的过程，引导曾受坏家伙蒙蔽的群众联系自己的教训，大学毛主席关于阶级斗争和无产阶级文化大革命的论述。广大职工的阶级觉悟和对无产阶级文化大革命的认识有了很大提高，有的人还主动亮出自己的个人主义思想，在毛主席像前宣誓：决心丢掉私心杂念，和解放军一道，关心国家大事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    为了真正把群众的革命积极性充分调动起来，在忆苦后，部队同志又帮助广大职工开展了“三带、三找、三谈”活动。即带着本地区、本单位的问题，从毛主席著作中找答案，谈革命组织的重大责任；带着进一步搞好本地区和本厂无产阶级文化大革命的问题，从毛主席著作中找答案，谈当前文化大革命的大好形势；带着受迫害或受蒙蔽的问题，从毛主席著作中找答案，谈运动的大方向，从而进一步提高了广大革命群众的政治觉悟。革命组织“八·一八”的许多同志说：“过去，在资产阶级反动路线制造的白色恐怖下，我们挨打坐牢，是为了革命；现在，我们严格执行政策，不打人，不报复，也是为了革命。我们如果不积极闹革命，就对不起毛主席他老人家对我们的关怀。”
    坚定地支持左派，就能迅速地壮大左派队伍
    部队同志立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊地站在“八·一八”革命派一边。他们热情地帮助革命派学习毛主席著作，坚定斗争意志，提高胜利信心，壮大革命队伍。对保守组织的头头，则予以揭露和孤立；对其中受蒙蔽的群众，进行耐心教育，消除顾虑，并组织他们学习《古田会议决议》，和他们谈心，启发他们和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，欢迎他们参加
  “八·一八”组织，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。现在这些厂子的保守组织纷纷解体，“八·一八”革命组织不断壮大，革命形势一片大好。
    坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，大胆解放革命干部
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在干部问题上推行的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，在这几个单位没有得到彻底批判，流毒也没有肃清。部队同志就和革命群众组织一起，学习毛主席关于干部政策的论述，学习《红旗》杂志有关评论，深入批判在干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，肃清不分青红皂白、凡带“长”字的都“靠边站”的反动思潮，使大家能够用阶级分析的方法对待干部。同时，又帮助领导干部学习毛主席著作，特别是学习“老三篇”，克服“怕”字和“怨”字等私心杂念，使他们敢于站出来革命。在提高了革命群众和革命干部思想认识的基础上，部队同志又作了细致的调查研究，对干部进行了摸底排队。然后，通过群众酝酿讨论和干部“亮相”，让革命干部站出来。目前，许多革命领导干部已经站了出来，有严重错误的干部也决心回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，在抓革命、促生产中立功赎罪，将功补过。
