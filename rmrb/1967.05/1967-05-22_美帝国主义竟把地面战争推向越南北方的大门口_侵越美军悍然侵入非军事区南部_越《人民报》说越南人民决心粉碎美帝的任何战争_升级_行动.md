The U.S. imperialists have pushed ground warfare to the doorstep of North Vietnam. The invading U.S. forces have brazenly invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone. The Vietnam People's Daily says the Vietnamese people are determined to smash any U.S. imperialist war "escalation" actions.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on May 21st, Saigon reports: On the 18th, the U.S. Marine Corps brazenly invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone in Vietnam. This is a very serious war "escalation" action taken by U.S. imperialism after suffering continuous defeats in South Vietnam.

According to Western news agencies, on the 18th, the U.S. invading forces first used warships and aircraft to launch airstrikes and naval bombardments on the demilitarized zone from the sea and air. Then, the U.S. Marine Corps and puppet paratroopers invaded the southern part of the demilitarized zone in multiple waves. By the 20th, the number of invading U.S. and puppet forces in the demilitarized zone had increased to more than ten thousand.

After the U.S. and puppet forces entered the demilitarized zone, they began to massacre the local people, using aircraft to bomb and burn down villages, and forcibly driving the residents to concentration camps south of the demilitarized zone, creating a "no-man's-land." At the same time, the U.S. invaders used cannons set up south of the demilitarized zone and cannons on warships to fire thousands of shells at the northern part of the demilitarized zone and the Vinh Linh area of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, engaging in mad war provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

On their way into the demilitarized zone, the U.S. and puppet forces were met with fierce ambushes by the military and people of the northern part of Quang Tri province. Reports indicate that in the first battle, more than 200 American aggressors were eliminated, many American helicopters were shot down or damaged, and several warships and landing craft were heavily bombarded. Near Quang Tri city, two battalions of puppet forces were pinned down and heavily attacked by guerrillas, suffering heavy casualties.

According to reports, to prepare for this invasion, U.S. Commander in Vietnam Westmoreland and the head of the U.S. Marine Corps, Walter, went to the battlefield south of the demilitarized zone in early May to make arrangements and boost the morale of the American aggressors who had been badly beaten by the liberation armed forces. At the same time, U.S. imperialism mobilized its propaganda machine to preemptively create various excuses for occupying the demilitarized zone, falsely claiming that the Vietnamese People's Army uses the southern part of the demilitarized zone as a "sanctuary."

In the northern part of South Vietnam, south of the demilitarized zone, U.S. imperialism has deployed 75,000 U.S. Marines and a large number of puppet forces, with nearly two U.S. divisions and one puppet division concentrated in the Quang Tri and Thua Thien areas adjacent to the southern part of the demilitarized zone. They have been conducting large-scale "sweeps" to attempt to annihilate the local liberation armed forces and prepare conditions for occupying the demilitarized zone and expanding the war of aggression on the ground to North Vietnam and Laos.

The liberation armed forces have resolutely struck back at these American aggressors. The main forces and guerrillas have closely cooperated, tying down and heavily attacking the U.S. and puppet forces, eliminating a large number of enemies. In the first quarter of this year, the military and people of Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces alone annihilated more than 10,000 U.S. and puppet forces. From April 24th to May 7th, over a period of more than ten days, they killed or wounded more than 2,800 U.S. and puppet forces, the vast majority of whom were U.S. Marines.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi on May 21st, the Vietnam People's Daily published an editorial on May 21st strongly condemning the U.S. aggressors for brazenly sending more than ten battalions of U.S. and puppet forces to invade the southern part of the demilitarized zone, escalating the war.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. aggressors' invasion of the southern part of the demilitarized zone is being carried out at the same time as their aerial bombardment of the urban and suburban areas of Hanoi. This indicates that the U.S. aggressors are further taking extremely serious war "escalation" actions.

The editorial pointed out that the U.S. invading forces' "sweeps" in the demilitarized zone completely violate the Geneva Agreement on the Vietnam issue regarding the demilitarized zone. As the Associated Press admitted on May 19th, U.S. imperialism has already "pushed ground warfare to the doorstep of North Vietnam."

The editorial warned the U.S. aggressors: The Vietnamese people are prepared and determined to smash any of their war "escalation" actions. Due to the U.S. aggressors' wanton invasion of the southern part of the demilitarized zone, the Vietnamese people have the right to take all necessary measures to retaliate and punish them.

The editorial condemned the British authorities for acting as U.S. imperialist accomplices, defending the criminal actions of the U.S. military's invasion of the demilitarized zone, and called on the people of the world to take effective action to stop the U.S. imperialist aggressors' clutches.

### 美帝国主义竟把地面战争推向越南北方的大门口  侵越美军悍然侵入非军事区南部  越《人民报》说越南人民决心粉碎美帝的任何战争“升级”行动

    美帝国主义竟把地面战争推向越南北方的大门口
    侵越美军悍然侵入非军事区南部
    越《人民报》说越南人民决心粉碎美帝的任何战争“升级”行动
    据新华社二十一日讯  西贡消息：美国海军陆战队十八日悍然侵入越南非军事区南部。这是美帝国主义在南越战场上连吃败仗之后采取的一个极其严重的战争“升级”行动。
    据西方通讯社报道，十八日，美国侵略军首先出动军舰和飞机从海上和空中对非军事区进行狂轰滥炸，然后美国海军陆战队和伪军伞兵分成多路侵入非军事区南部。到二十日止，侵入非军事区的美伪军已增加到一万多名。
    美伪军进入非军事区以后，就血腥屠杀当地人民，派飞机轰炸和放火烧毁那里的村庄，用武力把当地居民赶到非军事区以南的集中营去。在非军事区南部制造“无人区”。同时美国侵略者用架设在非军事区以南的大炮和军舰上的大炮向非军事区北部和越南民主共和国的永灵区发射了成千发炮弹，对越南民主共和国进行疯狂的战争挑衅。
    在美伪军侵入非军事区的途中，遭到了广治省北部军民猛烈的截击。据报道，在第一次战斗中，就有二百多名美国强盗被消灭，许多美国直升飞机被击落击伤，一些军舰和登陆舰遭到猛烈轰击。在广治市附近，两营伪军被游击队揪住猛打，伤亡重大。
    据报道，为了准备这次侵略行动，美国侵越军总司令威斯特摩兰和美国海军陆战队头子沃尔特曾在五月初先后到非军事区以南的战地进行部署，并给那些被解放武装力量打得焦头烂额的美国强盗打气。同时，美帝国主义还开动宣传机器，预先为侵占非军事区制造种种借口，胡说什么越南人民军把非军事区南部作为“庇护所”。
    美帝国主义在非军事区以南的南越北部几个省里，投入了海军陆战队七万五千名和大量伪军，其中在紧接非军事区南部的广治和承天地区就集结了美军近两个师和伪军一个师，不断进行大规模的“扫荡”，企图围歼当地的解放武装力量，为占领非军事区和把侵略战争从地面上扩大到越南北方和老挝准备条件。
    解放武装力量坚决打击这些美国侵略者，主力部队和游击队密切配合，拖住美伪军狠打，消灭了大量敌人。在今年第一季度中，广治和承天两省军民就歼灭美伪军一万多名，从四月二十四日到五月七日的十多天中，共打死打伤美伪军二千八百多名，其中绝大部分是美国海军陆战队。
    据新华社河内二十一日电　越南《人民报》二十一日发表评论员文章，强烈谴责美国侵略者悍然出动十多个营的美伪军侵入非军事区南部的战争“升级”行动。
    文章指出，美国强盗侵入非军事区南部的这一行动，是在它用空军对河内市区和郊区进行狂轰滥炸的同时进行的。这表明，美国侵略者正在进一步采取极其严重的战争“升级”行动。
    文章指出，美国侵略军侵入非军事区南部进行“扫荡”，完全破坏了关于越南问题的日内瓦协议中关于非军事区的规定。正如美联社五月十九日所招认的，美帝国主义已经把“地面战争推进到了北越的大门口”。
    文章警告美国侵略者：越南人民已经作好了准备，决心粉碎它的任何战争“升级”行动。由于美国侵略者对非军事区南部的猖狂侵犯，越南人民有权采取一切必要措施来还击和惩罚它。
    文章谴责英国当局充当美帝帮凶，为美军侵入非军事区的罪恶行动进行辩护，并且呼吁世界人民采取有力的行动，制止美帝国主义侵略者的魔爪。
