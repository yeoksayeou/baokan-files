The broad masses and art workers in Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, and other places are jubilantly celebrating the great victory of the Peking Opera Revolution. They vow to be revolutionaries, perform revolutionary plays, and dedicate their lives to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are determined to turn the cultural front into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have expressed that they will firmly grasp both the pen and the gun to defend the ironclad state of the proletariat.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary art workers in Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and Shandong, are filled with immense excitement. They are enthusiastically celebrating the publication of Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech "On the Peking Opera Revolution" and the editorial "Hail the Great Victory of the Peking Opera Revolution" by the Red Flag magazine. The workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and revolutionary art workers in these regions believe that the publication of these two important articles, which are brimming with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat and thoroughly crushed the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. Once again, it has declared the bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line and pointed out the bright prospects and direction of effort for the Peking Opera Revolution and the opening of a new era of proletarian literature. They have expressed that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly overthrow and expose the biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, combine the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their respective regions and units, complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various fields, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy all positions.

National agricultural labor model, Li Shunda, the head of Xigou Brigade in Pingding County, Shanxi Province, and his deputy, Shenyilan, excitedly said after hearing the two important articles on the radio: For thousands of years, the stage has been dominated by emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, who have been glorified by the feudal landlords and all exploiting classes. We have long hated it and have been eagerly waiting for the day when we can drive these parasites who eat human flesh and drink human blood off the stage and bring the magnificent image of the workers, peasants, and soldiers onto the stage. Today, under the guidance of the revolutionary line of our most beloved Chairman Mao and Comrade Jiang Qing, the Peking Opera Revolution has achieved a great victory, and our wish has begun to come true. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. We firmly stand with the revolutionary faction of the proletariat in the literary world, thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in the literary world, and turn the literary front into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary faction of the Shanxi People's Drama Troupe said, The great victory of the Peking Opera Revolution heralds a flourishing and prosperous scene on the literary front of our country. We must advance with the momentum, thoroughly bury the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line, sweep away all the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties from the stage, and let the heroes of the proletariat forever be the masters of the stage. The revolutionary art warriors of the Taiyuan Peking Opera Troupe said, We must see that the great victory of the Peking Opera Revolution is very great, but at the same time, we must also see that this victory is only the first step of the Long March of ten thousand li, and more arduous revolutionary struggles lie ahead. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words well, follow the direction of Chairman Mao's instructions for literature to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and forever advance, carrying the Peking Opera Revolution through to the end!

The warriors of the Red Rebel Corps of the Harbin Peking Opera Theater talked about how, during the national modern Peking Opera performance in 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing showed great concern for the revolutionary modern plays performed by their theater and provided many valuable opinions on the script. However, a small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the original provincial and municipal committees and a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in their theater colluded to pay lip service to Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions but did not carry them out. In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have exposed this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed that they would thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line and long-term, unconditionally go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from them, combine with them, be revolutionaries, perform revolutionary plays, and dedicate their lives to serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Recently, the cultural warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the New Wind Factory Revolutionary Committee, who have taken to the streets to perform many battle-ready cultural programs, excitedly said: In the cultural revolution, we, with our iron-hammered hands, have raised the battle flag of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" high and stepped onto the cultural stage, joining the ranks of those who have opened fire on the biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Comrade Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial of the Red Flag magazine have greatly boosted our morale. We, the amateur cultural workers of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, will definitely use the sharp weapon of literature to fiercely open fire on the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The literary circles of Guizhou Province and Guiyang City, as well as the workers, peasants, and soldiers who are active in amateur literature, held a grand celebration and parade on the 10th of May to commemorate the publication of Comrade Jiang Qing's speech and the editorial of the Red Flag magazine. They also performed excerpts from the model Peking operas "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang," as well as the large-scale song and dance drama "Thunder in the Southwest" that enthusiastically praises Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at various points in the city. At all performance points, the audience was vast, and the scene was unprecedented. The revolutionary faction of the Guizhou Peking Opera Troupe hurriedly rehearsed and performed the propaganda program "Hail the Great Victory of the Peking Opera Revolution" on the streets at night.

After Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech and the editorial of the Red Flag magazine reached Jinan, the responsible person of the Shandong Literary Revolution Rebel Command said happily, Comrade Jiang Qing has always been very concerned about the literary circles of Shandong. The model Peking opera "Ambush on the White Tiger Regiment" is personally directed by Comrade Jiang Qing. Its appearance is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the result of the victory of the proletarian revolutionary literary line over the counter-revolutionary literary line of the bourgeoisie. We must study and use Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Jiang Qing's speech as well as the editorial of the Red Flag magazine well to complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in the literary circles and let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high on the literary front of Shandong.

Xinhua News Agency reported on the 11th that the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, the staunch defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are most enthusiastically celebrating the publication of Comrade Jiang Qing's important speech "On the Peking Opera Revolution" and the editorial "Hail the Great Victory of the Peking Opera Revolution" by the Red Flag magazine on the day of the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." They believe that under the brilliant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Jiang Qing, and with the efforts of the broad revolutionary comrades in the Peking Opera world, the great victory of the Peking Opera Revolution has fully demonstrated the invincibility and irresistibility of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The soldiers and officers expressed with full confidence that the victory of the Peking Opera Revolution, as an important part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, indicates that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely achieve comprehensive and thorough victory. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, the strong pillar of the proletarian dictatorship, will definitely grasp the gun to be ready to deal with the armed enemies at any time and defend the proletarian dictatorship; they will pick up the pen to join the great criticism, overthrow the biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, sweep away the ghosts and snakes, and let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate all ideological and cultural positions.

In recent days, the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary art workers of the troops have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great instructions 23 years ago: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all old literature and art that are separated from the people), the people have become dregs, ruled by the masters, madams, young masters, and young ladies. This reversal of history is now reversed by you, restoring the true face of history. From now on, the old drama has a new face, so it is worth celebrating." They said, The victory of the Peking Opera Revolution and the birth of all excellent revolutionary model operas are precisely the realization of this task of "reversing the reversal of history" and restoring the true face of history. It proclaims the thorough bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line and opens up a new era of proletarian new literature, which has epoch-making significance. The pilots of the "Heroic Aviation Regiment" said in a discussion, The old Peking Opera stage was the most stubborn "fortress" of old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and an important position for the biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party to carry out capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration. However, as the great leader Chairman Mao predicted: "Socialism will inevitably replace capitalism. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the historical wheel, revolution will inevitably occur, and it will definitely be victorious." Under the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, this stubborn "fortress" has finally been broken, and the time for the proletariat's hundred flowers to bloom has arrived! "Model Soldier" Wang Yuchang said, The biggest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists under their protection have long resisted Chairman Mao's literary line and promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary line. Now, the Peking Opera stage has been seized by us, the proletariat, and the reversal of history has been reversed by us, the proletariat, again. This is a thousand times good! Ten thousand times good! The sky should be the sky of Mao Zedong Thought; the earth should be the earth of Mao Zedong Thought; the stage should be the stage to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The stage can only be occupied by us, the proletariat! The stage should only show the heroic image of the workers, peasants, and soldiers! We, the workers, peasants, and soldiers, should stride onto the stage and wield the iron broom to sweep all the emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties into the garbage heap of history.

All soldiers and cultural warriors in the army praised the epoch-making great achievements of the Peking Opera Revolution and unanimously praised Comrade Jiang Qing for her special contributions in adhering to Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line and fighting bravely against the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie. They said: The birth and development of the new revolutionary Peking Opera are inseparable from Comrade Jiang Qing's guidance. Comrade Jiang Qing personally participated in the struggle practice and artistic practice. Every revolutionary cultural warrior should take Comrade Jiang Qing as an example and learn from her. The cultural warriors of the Guangzhou Military Region's Warrior Drama Troupe, who are currently rehearsing and performing "The Great Wall of the South China Sea," said in a discussion that Comrade Jiang Qing has the best understanding and application of Chairman Mao's literary thought, the most active use, the most resolute implementation, and the most heroic defense. These cultural warriors who participated in the performance of "The Great Wall of the South China Sea" and directly received Comrade Jiang Qing's guidance said, Comrade Jiang Qing attaches great importance to and cares for the creation of "The Great Wall of the South China Sea." She watched our performance four times in her busy schedule and had many talks with us, providing many valuable opinions. Now, the publication of Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is a great encouragement to the revolutionary cultural warriors. It will definitely promote the overall development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieve greater and newer victories! We will definitely learn from Comrade Jiang Qing, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, set ambitious goals, establish a great cause, create new things for socialism, and establish a unique proletarian style, and strive to create more new proletarian dramas. The cultural warriors of the performing group of a certain unit of the Shenyang Military Region said in a discussion, Comrade Jiang Qing's speech is brilliant with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, and is a summary of the great practice of literary revolution, and an important document for the thorough revolution on the literary front. We must take Comrade Jiang Qing as an example, firmly and unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's literary line, be good soldiers of the proletariat, write good soldiers of the proletariat, and perform good soldiers of the proletariat, and fight for the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought and the defense of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line for life.

During the discussion, the broad soldiers and officers repeatedly recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people." They expressed time and again: Revolutionary soldiers must firmly grasp the pen and the gun to defend the ironclad state of the proletariat.

    据新华社十一日讯　山西、黑龙江、贵州、山东等地的广大工农兵和革命文艺工作者，怀着无比激动的心情，热烈欢呼江青同志的重要讲话《谈京剧革命》和《红旗》杂志社论《欢呼京剧革命的伟大胜利》的发表。这些地区的革命职工、贫下中农、革命干部、红卫兵小将和革命文艺工作者认为，这两篇闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的重要文章的发表，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级老爷们的威风，再一次宣告了反革命修正主义文艺路线的破产，指明了京剧革命以及开拓无产阶级文艺新纪元的光辉前景和努力方向。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底打倒、批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把革命的大批判同本地区、本单位的斗批改结合起来，完成各个领域内的斗批改任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远占领一切阵地。
    全国农业劳动模范、山西省平顺县西沟公社西沟大队大队长李顺达和副大队长申纪兰，从广播中听到这两篇重要文章以后兴奋地说：几千年来，戏剧舞台都是被帝王将相、才子佳人统治着，为封建地主和一切剥削阶级涂脂抹粉，叫好喝采，我们早就恨透了，我们早就盼望着总有一天把那些吃人肉、喝人血的寄生虫们统统从舞台上赶下去，把工农兵的伟大形象搬上舞台。今天，在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的革命路线引导下，在江青同志指导下，京剧革命获得了伟大的胜利，我们的愿望开始实现了。这是毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。我们坚决和文艺界的无产阶级革命派团结在一起，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在文艺界散布的流毒，把文艺战线办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    山西人民话剧团的革命派说，京剧革命的伟大胜利，预示着我国文艺战线即将出现一个百花盛开的欣欣向荣的局面。我们一定要乘胜前进，把反革命修正主义的文艺路线彻底埋葬，把帝王将相、才子佳人统统从舞台上扫掉，让无产阶级的英雄人物永远成为舞台的主人。太原市京剧团的革命文艺战士说，我们既要看到京剧革命已经取得的胜利十分伟大，同时也要看到这个胜利还只是万里长征走完了第一步，更艰巨的革命斗争还在前面。我们一定要好好听毛主席的话，遵循毛主席指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，永远前进，把京剧革命进行到底！
    哈尔滨市京剧院火种红色造反团的战士们谈到，在一九六四年全国京剧现代戏观摩演出中，江青同志对他们院演出的革命现代戏非常关心，并且对剧本提出了许多宝贵意见。可是，原省、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们院的一小撮反革命修正主义分子串通一气，对江青同志的指示阳奉阴违，拒不执行。在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。他们表示，一定要彻底批倒批臭反革命修正主义文艺路线，并且长期地、无条件地深入到工农兵中间去，向工农兵学习，与工农兵结合，做个革命人，演好革命戏，一辈子为工农兵服务。
    最近走上街头，演出许多具有战斗气魄的文艺节目的新风加工厂革命委员会毛泽东思想宣传队的文艺战士激动地说：在文化大革命中，我们用握铁锤的双手，高举起《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的战斗旗帜，走上了文艺舞台，加入了向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火的行列。江青同志的讲话和《红旗》杂志的社论极大地鼓舞了我们的斗志，我们工农兵业余文艺工作者一定要更好地运用文艺这个锐利的武器，狠狠地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。
    贵州省和贵阳市文艺界以及工农兵业余文艺积极分子，就江青同志讲话和《红旗》杂志社论的发表，五月十日举行了隆重的庆祝集会和游行，并且在城区分点演出了京剧样板戏《红灯记》、《沙家浜》，以及热情歌颂毛泽东思想和无产阶级文化大革命的大型歌舞剧《西南的春雷》等片断。在所有的演出点上，观众人山人海，盛况空前。贵州省京剧团的革命派连夜赶排了宣传节目《欢呼京剧革命的伟大胜利》到街头演出。
    江青同志的重要讲话和《红旗》杂志社论传到济南以后，山东文艺革命造反司令部的负责人高兴地说，江青同志对山东文艺界一直非常关心，京剧样板戏《奇袭白虎团》就是江青同志亲自抓的。它的出现，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级革命文艺路线战胜资产阶级反革命文艺路线的结果。我们一定要学好用好毛主席的著作和江青同志的讲话以及《红旗》杂志的社论，完成文艺界的斗批改任务，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗永远高高飘扬在山东的文艺阵地上。
    新华社十一日讯　无产阶级文化大革命的坚强保卫者人民解放军陆海空三军指战员，最热烈地欢呼在举国欢庆毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的日子里，江青同志的重要讲话《谈京剧革命》和《红旗》杂志社论《欢呼京剧革命的伟大胜利》的发表，大长了无产阶级的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。指战员们一致认为，在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的指导下，在京剧界广大革命同志的努力下，京剧革命所取得的伟大胜利，充分表明伟大的毛泽东思想无坚不摧、无攻不克。
    指战员们满怀信心地表示，作为无产阶级文化大革命一个重要组成部分的京剧革命的胜利，表明无产阶级文化大革命必将取得全面的彻底的胜利。无产阶级专政的强大柱石——人民解放军的指战员们，一定要紧握枪杆，时刻准备对付拿枪的敌人，保卫无产阶级专政；拿起笔杆，投入革命的大批判，批倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫牛鬼蛇神，让毛泽东思想的光辉照亮所有的思想文化阵地。
    连日来，人民解放军广大指战员和部队革命文艺工作者，认真学习了毛主席二十三年前的伟大指示：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。”他们说，京剧革命的胜利，一切优秀革命样板戏的诞生，正是实现了这种把“历史的颠倒”“再颠倒过来”的伟大任务，它宣告反革命修正主义文艺路线的彻底破产，开创了无产阶级新文艺的新纪元，具有划时代的伟大意义。空军“航空兵英雄中队”的飞行员们在座谈时说，过去的京剧舞台，是旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯统治的一个最顽固的“堡垒”，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派进行资本主义反革命复辟的一个重要阵地。但是正如伟大领袖毛主席所预言的：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，这个顽固“堡垒”终于被冲破了，无产阶级的百花盛开的时节来到了！“爱兵模范”王裕昌说，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他卵翼下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，长期以来，一直对抗毛主席的文艺路线，推行反革命修正主义的文艺路线。现在，京剧舞台被我们无产阶级夺过来了，历史的颠倒又被我们无产阶级再颠倒过来了，这是一千个大好！一万个大好！天，就应该是毛泽东思想的天；地，就应该是毛泽东思想的地；舞台，就应该是宣传毛泽东思想的舞台。舞台，只能由我们无产阶级占领！舞台上就是要表现工农兵的英雄形象！我们工农兵就是要大踏步地走上舞台，抡起铁扫帚，把帝王将相、才子佳人通通扫进历史的垃圾堆。
    全军指战员和文艺战士们在赞扬京剧革命划时代的伟大成就时，都一致赞扬江青同志坚持毛主席的革命文艺路线，同资产阶级反动势力进行英勇斗争所作出的特殊贡献。他们说：革命的新京剧的诞生和发展，是同江青同志的指导分不开的。江青同志亲自参加了斗争实践和艺术实践，每一个革命文艺战士都要以江青同志为榜样，向江青同志学习。正在加工排练《南海长城》的广州部队战士话剧团的文艺战士们，在座谈会上以自己切身体会说明江青同志对毛主席的文艺思想学习得最好，运用得最活，贯彻最坚决，捍卫最英勇。这些当年参加过《南海长城》演出并直接受过江青同志指导的文艺战士们说，江青同志非常重视和关怀《南海长城》的创作，她在百忙中曾先后四次看了我们的演出，多次找我们谈话，提出了许多宝贵的意见。现在，江青同志讲话的发表是对革命文艺战士的巨大鼓舞。它必将推动整个无产阶级文化大革命向前发展，夺取更大更新的胜利！我们一定向江青同志学习，努力活学活用毛主席著作，树雄心，立壮志，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，为创作更多的无产阶级新话剧而奋斗。沈阳部队某部战士演唱组战士们在座谈会上说，江青同志的讲话字字句句闪耀着毛泽东思想的光辉，是一篇文艺革命的伟大实践的经验总结，是文艺战线进行彻底革命的一个重要文件。我们一定要以江青同志为榜样，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的文艺路线，当好无产阶级的兵，写好无产阶级的兵，演好无产阶级的兵，为大立毛泽东思想、为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战斗一辈子。
    在座谈中，广大指战员们还一遍又一遍地朗诵毛主席的教导：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”一次又一次地表示：革命战士一定要紧握笔杆和枪杆，保卫好无产阶级的铁打江山。
