Chairman Mao has taught us: "Our literature and art are for the people. They must serve the people and, first of all, the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They must be for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and they must be created for them and used by them." The Shanghai Municipal Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' Art Festival, which began on April 20, has achieved great success. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Art Troupes, composed of workers, peasants, and soldiers, have gone to the fields, into the factories, to the docks, and aboard ships, performing everywhere and being enthusiastically welcomed by the masses. They enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, cheer for the revolution, sing for the revolution, and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have opened a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, making literature and art truly serve the purpose of "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

The red sun rises in the east, and golden sunlight bathes the earth. The great leader Chairman Mao, we are forever loyal to you.

The revolutionary little red guards, the words of Chairman Mao are what they love to hear, determined to learn from the People's Liberation Army, to defend the proletarian state for ten thousand years.

Three victories in three battles fought well, the people of the whole country clap and laugh. If the American planes dare to come and invade again, they will come and never return.

The golden sun rises in the east, shining brightly on the earth, the great leader Chairman Mao, the poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow you.

Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the help of the sun, revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. Following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao for literature and art, we go to the fields, to the barracks, to the factories.

The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Municipality has been established, and the workers, peasants, and soldiers of Shanghai sing in unison of the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat unite, and thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party!

    毛主席的革命文艺路线胜利万岁
    ——上海工农兵文艺会演记实
    毛主席教导说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”从四月二十日开始的上海市工农兵文艺会演，获得了极大的成功。由工农兵组成的毛泽东思想宣传文艺小分队，走向田间，走进工厂，深入码头，登上舰艇，到处进行演出活动，受到群众热烈欢迎。他们热情地宣传毛泽东思想，为革命摇旗呐喊，为革命纵情歌唱，坚决地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，使文艺真正起到了“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的重大作用。
    红彤彤的太阳从东方升起，金色的阳光普照大地，伟大的领袖毛主席，我们永远忠于您。
    革命小将红卫兵，毛主席的话儿最爱听，立志学习解放军，保卫无产阶级江山万年红。
    三战三捷打得好，全国人民拍手笑。美机胆敢继续来侵犯，叫它有来无回逃不掉。
    金色的太阳升起在东方，照得大地亮堂堂，伟大领袖毛主席，贫下中农永远跟着您。
    大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。沿着毛主席指引的文艺方向，走向田间，走向营房，走向工厂。
    北京市革命委员会成立了，上海的工农兵文艺战士齐声歌唱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线伟大胜利。无产阶级革命派联合起来，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒！
