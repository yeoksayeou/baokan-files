In the midst of the thorough criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number," and in the struggle to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, we watched the color film "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army." Our hearts were filled with intense emotion. We repeatedly shouted in our hearts: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

In this great revolutionary mass movement, it is our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, who has shown us the way, given us the courage to fight, and provided us with boundless strength!

For eleven months since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the campus of Tsinghua University has never been calm. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines has been fierce and ongoing.

Tsinghua University has over five hundred cadres. In early June last year, soon after the work team entered the school, they spread the following among the students: "From the Party Committee to each branch, all cadres are corrupt, none are good." "All cadres in Tsinghua are 'ghosts' (meaning monsters and demons)." "Tsinghua cadres cannot be reformed in eight years." Thus, many cadres were "dismissed" and "demoted," all "sidelined," and forced to "go upstairs" to make self-criticisms.

We two were originally working in the army and later transferred to Tsinghua University as cadres. Over the years, although we have been repeatedly persecuted by the old Party Committee, we have never surrendered and have always persisted in the struggle. In June last year, after the work team entered the school, they faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line formulated by the top capitalist-roader within the Party, "striking down a large number and protecting a small number." They locked us two and many other cadres up, not allowing us to read big-character posters, not allowing us to participate in the movement or any meetings, only forcing us to read "Cultivation" all day. They accused us, saying: "The reason you make mistakes is that you have read this book too little." They wanted us to examine our thoughts in accordance with this book and forced us to admit that we were consciously anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. On the contrary, they protected a small number of real capitalist-roaders in power, hiding Jiang X in the "safe" of the Ministry of Higher Education, not allowing him to be dragged back to the school. They also spread the word everywhere: "Jiang X's nature is undetermined." The other few capitalist-roaders within the Party also went unpunished. Later, because everyone was so angry, they had to put on a show and hastily criticized two or three people.

When Chairman Mao inspected the Cultural Revolution Army for the fifth and sixth times, we were still under "control" and could not participate. The work team wanted to separate us from Chairman Mao and from the masses. However, during those days, our hearts were even closer to Chairman Mao. We repeatedly recited: Chairman Mao understands us the most. He will surely stand up for us.

After the establishment of the Tsinghua Jian Gangshan Corps, all revolutionary teachers and students united around this revolutionary mass organization and engaged in a head-on struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line. Now we have all been liberated. Watching the film "Chairman Mao's Fifth and Sixth Inspections of the Cultural Revolution Army," we deeply feel: Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary mass movement the most. We solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: We will definitely, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, bravely join the mass movement to criticize the top capitalist-roader within the Party, build new achievements, and contribute our own strength to realizing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    忆往昔峥嵘岁月稠
    清华大学革命干部　韩银山　张修身
    在彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的高潮中，在群众性的批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，我们看了《毛主席第五、第六次检阅文化革命大军》的彩色纪录片，心情异常激动。我们无数次地在心里高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在这场伟大的革命群众运动的风暴中，是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，给我们指明了方向，给了我们战斗的勇气和无穷的力量！
    无产阶级文化大革命开展十一个月来，清华园一直没平静过。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争始终在激烈地进行着。
    清华大学有五百多干部。去年六月初，工作组进校后不久，就在同学中散布：“从党委到各支部的干部都烂了，没一个好的。”“清华的干部都是‘牛’字号的（意即牛鬼蛇神）。”“清华的干部八年也改造不过来。”这样，许多干部都被“撤职罢官”，统统“靠边站”，并赶“上楼”作检查。
    我们两人原来都在部队工作，后来转业到清华大学当干部。多年来，我们虽屡遭旧党委的迫害，但始终没有屈服，一直坚持斗争。去年六月工作组进校后，忠实地执行了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所制定的资产阶级反动路线，“打击一大片，保护一小撮”，把我们两人和许多干部都“关”起来，不让我们看大字报，不让我们参加运动和任何会议，只让我们成天读《修养》。他们指责我们说：“你们所以犯错误，就是因为读这本书读得太少了。”他们要我们对照着这本书检查思想，强迫我们承认自己是自觉反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的。相反，对于一小撮真正走资本主义道路的当权派，他们却尽力保护，把蒋××藏在高教部的“保险柜”里，不准揪回学校来。他们还四处散布：“蒋××的性质未定。”其他的几个党内走资本主义道路的当权派也逍遥法外。后来，因大家气愤得不得了，他们才不得不装装样子，草草斗了两、三个人。
    毛主席第五、第六次检阅文化革命大军的时候，我们还被“管制”着，没有能够参加。工作组想把我们和毛主席隔开，把我们和群众隔开，但是，在那些日子里，我们的心和毛主席贴得更紧了。我们天天默念着：毛主席最理解我们，他老人家一定会给我们作主的。
    清华井冈山兵团成立以后，广大革命师生都团结在这个革命群众组织周围，和资产阶级反动路线展开了针锋相对的斗争。现在我们都被解放出来了。看了《毛主席第五、第六次检阅文化革命大军》的影片，我们深深感到：毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持革命的群众运动。我们向毛主席庄严宣誓：一定要在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，更加勇敢地投到批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动中去，建新功，立新劳，为实现革命的“三结合”，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，贡献自己的一份力量。
