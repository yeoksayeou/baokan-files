Bourgeois literary and artistic figures depict the revolutionary masses as rioters and portray themselves as saints. They invert the concepts of light and darkness. Only truly revolutionary literary and artistic figures can correctly address the issues of praise and exposure. All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised. This is the fundamental task of revolutionary literary and artistic figures.

    毛主席语录
    资产阶级文艺家把革命群众写成暴徒，把他们自己写成神圣，所谓光明和黑暗是颠倒的。只有真正革命的文艺家才能正确地解决歌颂和暴露的问题。一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。
                                《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
