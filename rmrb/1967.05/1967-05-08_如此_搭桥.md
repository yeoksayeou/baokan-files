Such "Bridge-Building"

The Soviet revisionist leadership recently signed a contract with Italy's largest monopoly capitalist, Fiat Automobile Factory, to build a car plant in Ukraine with an annual production capacity of 600,000 small cars.

This matter greatly pleased American imperialism. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense immediately supported the Export-Import Bank in lending $50 million to Fiat Automobile Factory to purchase the necessary machinery from the United States. Assistant Secretary of Defense McNaughton praised this in Congress, saying, "This will be an important part of President Johnson's plan to build bridges with Eastern Europe," and "This method of bridge-building is in line with our national security interests."

Why would the Soviet revisionist leadership's request for Fiat Automobile Factory to build a car plant be in line with American "security interests"?

Former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Ball revealed the secret. He said meaningfully, "The automobile is an ideological vehicle with four wheels... The Russians will never be the same again." This means that helping the Soviet revisionist group build a car plant is helping them use Western bourgeois lifestyles to corrupt the Soviet people, helping them hasten the restoration of capitalism. This, of course, is in line with American imperialism's "security interests." No wonder the American bosses rushed to provide assistance.

Johnson is eagerly seeking to "build bridges" with the Soviet Union, which, in essence, is to further open up avenues for political and economic infiltration into the Soviet Union. In fact, since Dulles proposed the so-called "peaceful evolution" policy, American imperialism has been building a single-plank bridge to drag the Soviet Union back to capitalism. The Soviet revisionist leadership regards such a single-plank bridge as a treasure, humbly begging to cooperate with American imperialism, thinking that by building this bridge, they can sit on an equal footing with American imperialism and jointly dominate the world. This is nothing but a pipe dream. Those who are determined to restore capitalism, bury the fruits of the October Revolution, and betray the interests of the Soviet people will surely meet a bad end.

### 如此“搭桥”

    如此“搭桥”
    苏修领导集团不久以前同意大利最大的垄断资本菲亚特汽车工厂签订了一个合同，由菲亚特工厂在乌克兰建立一座年产六十万辆小型轿车的汽车厂。
    这件事情使美帝国主义大为满意。美国商务部和国防部马上支持进出口银行贷款五千万美元给菲亚特工厂，以便从美国购买所需要的机器。美国助理国防部长麦克诺顿在国会里称赞说，“这在约翰逊总统的同东欧搭桥的计划中将是一个重要组成部分”，“这种搭桥的做法是符合我们的国家安全利益的”。
    苏修领导集团要菲亚特工厂建一个汽车工厂，为什么会是符合美国的“安全利益”的呢？
    美国前副国务卿鲍尔说出了其中的奥妙。他寓意深长地说：“汽车是四个轮子的意识形态……俄国人决不会再老样子了。”这就是说，帮助苏修集团建一个汽车厂，就是帮助他们用西方资产阶级生活方式腐蚀苏联人民，就是帮助他们加紧复辟资本主义。这当然是符合美帝国主义的“安全利益”的。难怪美国大老板赶忙解囊相助了。
    约翰逊竭力谋求同苏联所谓“搭桥”，说穿了就是要进一步开辟向苏联进行政治和经济渗透的道路。其实，从杜勒斯提出所谓“和平演变”的政策以来，美帝国主义就一直在搭架一座把苏联拉回到资本主义去的独木桥。而苏修领导集团对于这样一座独木桥竟视为至宝，不惜低声下气地乞求与美帝国主义通力合作，他们以为搭成了这座桥梁，就可以同美帝国主义平起平坐，共同主宰世界了。这真是白日做梦。死心塌地复辟资本主义，葬送十月革命成果，叛卖苏联人民利益的家伙，是决没有好下场的。
