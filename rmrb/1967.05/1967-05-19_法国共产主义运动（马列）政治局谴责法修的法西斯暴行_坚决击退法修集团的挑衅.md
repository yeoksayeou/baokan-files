The Politburo of the French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) recently issued a statement condemning the French Communist Party's revisionist group for using fascist methods to disrupt a mass rally held on May 5 at the "Mutual Aid Hall" in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American imperialism.

The statement said: "The Politburo warmly congratulates the Marxist-Leninist fighters in the Paris region, whose courage, born of a correct grasp of Mao Zedong Thought, successfully repulsed the attack by the revisionists."

The statement pointed out that the French Communist Party's revisionist group, in this attack, shamefully colluded with the French police. The statement said, "This proves beyond doubt that the leaders of the French Communist Party have not a trace of communist or proletarian spirit left."

The statement said: "The French working class and people will increasingly be able to distinguish who are true friends of the Vietnamese people and who are false friends, who steadfastly oppose American imperialism and who, under the guise of hypocrisy, act as its accomplices."

The statement emphasized: "The French working class and people will realize that it is urgently necessary to expose the Munich policy of the leaders of the Soviet revisionist group, who have long been colluding with American imperialism, helping it to increasingly rampantly invade Vietnam, and helping it to attack glorious People's Republic of China—the new, impregnable bastion of world socialism."

The statement concluded that the social democrats and modern revisionists, who are the accomplices of American imperialism, are serving the imperialist policy of the United States.

The statement said that the French people will never allow, and will never permit, the imperialist schemes of American imperialism to succeed.

    法国共产主义运动（马列）政治局谴责法修的法西斯暴行
    坚决击退法修集团的挑衅
    新华社巴黎电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）政治局最近在一项公报中，谴责法共罗歇修正主义集团使用法西斯手段，破坏五日在“互助大厅”举行的支持越南人民抗美救国斗争的群众大会。
    公报说：“政治局热烈祝贺巴黎地区的马克思列宁主义战士，由于正确掌握毛泽东思想而产生的勇气，胜利地击退了修正主义分子的袭击。”
    公报指出，法国共产党修正主义集团在这次袭击中同法国警察可耻地勾结在一起，公报说，这“千真万确地证明了，法国共产党的头目们早已没有一丝一毫的共产党人和无产阶级的气味了。”
    公报说：“法国工人阶级和法国人民将日益善于识别谁是越南人民的真朋友，谁是越南人民的假朋友，谁坚定不移地反对美帝国主义，谁以伪善的面貌充当美帝国主义的帮凶。”
    公报强调说：“法国工人阶级和人民将认识到，迫切地需要揭露苏联修正主义集团头目的慕尼黑政策，这些人早已同美帝国主义勾结在一起，帮助它越来越猖狂地侵略越南，帮助它攻击光荣的中华人民共和国——世界社会主义的坚不可摧的新堡垒。”
    公报最后说，美帝国主义的帮凶社会民主党人和现代修正主义者正在为美帝的侵略政策效劳。
    公报说，法国人民决不容许，永远不会容许美帝国主义的侵略阴谋得逞。
