Capital revolutionary masses shout "Down with the Mongolian running dogs of Soviet revisionism!"
Warmly welcome overseas Chinese anti-revisionist fighters returning from Mongolia

	BEIJING, May 23 (Xinhua) — The three teachers from the Ulaanbaatar Overseas Chinese School, Wang Zhiyun, Chen Lu, and Zuo Guiyi, who were unjustly expelled from Mongolia by the Mongolian revisionist authorities, returned to the capital of their motherland, Beijing, by train today. They returned to the side of the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They were warmly welcomed by more than a thousand revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and returned overseas Chinese in the capital.

	Today, Beijing Railway Station was filled with a strong revolutionary atmosphere. The revolutionary masses of the capital held up portraits of Chairman Mao and large banners, which read: "Strongly condemn the Mongolian revisionists' crimes of persecuting overseas Chinese!" "Warmly welcome the return of the overseas Chinese teachers!" The welcoming crowd continuously sang revolutionary songs and recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the wheel of history, revolution will occur, sooner or later, and will inevitably triumph." At 10 a.m., the train slowly pulled into Beijing Station. Wang Zhiyun and the other two overseas Chinese anti-revisionist fighters stepped out of the carriage amid the deafening sound of gongs and drums. Deputy Director of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Nie Yuanzi, as well as representatives from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other relevant departments, and representatives of the proletarian revolutionary faction went forward to greet them and expressed their warm regards. Representatives of returned overseas Chinese presented the anti-revisionist fighters with "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and red armbands, and pinned Mao badges and big red flowers on their chests.

	When Wang Zhiyun, Chen Lu, and Zuo Guiyi met with the welcoming crowd, the revolutionary masses waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted with raised arms: "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Mongolian running dogs of Soviet revisionism!" "The Mongolian revisionists following Soviet revisionism in opposing China will meet a bad end!" "Those who oppose China will meet a bad end!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand years to our great leader Chairman Mao!"

    今天，北京火车站充满着一派强烈的革命气氛，首都革命群众高举着毛主席像和巨幅标语，标语上写着：“强烈抗议蒙修迫害华侨的罪行！”“热烈欢迎华侨教师胜利归来！”欢迎的群众不断高唱革命歌曲，齐声朗读毛主席的教导：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”上午十时，列车徐徐驶进北京站，王治云等三位华侨反修战士，在震天的锣鼓声中走出车厢。北京市革命委员会副主任委员聂元梓，以及华侨事务委员会、教育部、外交部等有关方面负责人和无产阶级革命派代表迎上前去，和他们热烈握手，表示亲切慰问。归国华侨代表向反修战士赠送了《毛主席语录》和红袖章，把毛主席像章和大红花别在他们的胸前。
    王治云、陈禄、左贵义同欢迎群众见面的时候，革命群众挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒苏修的走卒蒙修！”“蒙修追随苏修反华没有好下场！”“反华的人没有好下场！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
