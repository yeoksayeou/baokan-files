Comrades and fellow fighters!

Today, amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism and at the moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is launching a total assault and settlement of accounts against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and when the treacherous behavior and theories of Soviet modern revisionism are increasingly exposed worldwide, we, the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat in Shanghai, are holding a grand gathering to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's great work, "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This has great historical and contemporary significance.

"On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a brilliant crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought, an immortal document of Marxism-Leninism, a milestone in the development of Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a programmatic document against modern revisionism and all reactionary bourgeois ideologies, and a resounding call to arms for the oppressed peoples of the world to bravely charge against imperialism and all reactionaries.

In the history of the proletarian literary movement worldwide, "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was the first to clearly, comprehensively, and thoroughly propose the fundamental direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. It systematically solved the problem of literary workers uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and addressed a series of major, fundamental theoretical and practical issues in the development of proletarian literature. "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" comprehensively summarized the historical experience of the struggle between the two lines on the cultural front, thoroughly criticized the bourgeois literary line that had long dominated the Party, and comprehensively and deeply formulated the proletarian literary line and specific policies. "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" raised the banner of Marxism-Leninism's revolutionary criticism, delivering a devastating blow to various bourgeois and revisionist reactionary viewpoints in the fields of literature and ideology. It thoroughly exposed the reactionary face of the literary black line of the 1930s led by Zhou Yang, a criticism so profound, sharp, and powerful that it precisely struck at the core and essence of bourgeois reactionary worldviews and literary theories. As a result, various revisionist reactionary currents, including the treacherous points advocated in "Cultivation" that betray proletarian dictatorship and peddle class capitulationism, and the bourgeois humanism and humanitarianism cherished by Soviet modern revisionism, no matter how many disguises, variations, or flowery words they use, cannot escape the infinite power of the "mirror of demons" that is "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Once exposed, their ugly true forms are immediately revealed. The path indicated in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," where literary workers must unite with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, must unite with the new era of the masses, and must thoroughly transform their worldviews, is the only path for all revolutionary intellectuals to become revolutionary and proletarianized, the only path for the development of proletarian culture, and the fundamental guarantee against revisionism. All revolutionary cadres and cultural workers have found the fundamental way to carry out ideological transformation and unite with the masses from here. In solving various complex problems, "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" brilliantly and creatively applied and developed Marxist dialectics, serving as a shining example for us to learn how to apply dialectical materialism in revolutionary practice. "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is an eternal truth for the development of revolutionary culture, an invincible banner for proletarian literature, and a compass for the great revolution on the ideological and cultural front.

Chairman Mao's great work, along with his other great works such as "On New Democracy," "Letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe After Watching 'Adventure to Liangshan Mountain,'" and various important instructions and documents issued during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, opening up a new historical period for the development of proletarian literature and the proletarian cultural revolution.

Over the past 25 years, "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has had a tremendous impact both in China and around the world. It has pointed the way forward for all revolutionary literary workers and delivered a heavy blow to various reactionary bourgeois worldviews. The evaluation and praise of the great historical role of the workers, peasants, and soldiers in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the criticism of bourgeois reactionary worldviews such as "love for humanity" and "humanism," have helped the proletariat and revolutionary people worldwide to break free from the deception of the bourgeoisie and revisionism and to fight for their own liberation. Of course, these 25 years have not been smooth sailing. The history of these 25 years is filled with intense class struggles and struggles between the two lines. Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and other counterrevolutionary revisionists, along with the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party who strongly supported them, controlled the old Propaganda Department, the old Cultural Department, the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and many cultural departments nationwide. They fiercely opposed and resisted the proletarian literary line expounded in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and Chairman Mao's various important instructions on cultural issues. They crazily promoted a bourgeois reactionary literary line (i.e., counterrevolutionary revisionist literary line) to prepare public opinion for their evil business of restoring capitalism nationwide. In Shanghai, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the old Municipal Committee also fiercely resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line and obstructed Chairman Mao's instructions to criticize the bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the Party. They also vigorously opposed and sabotaged the struggle led by Comrade Ke Qingshi to uphold Chairman Mao's literary line. They colluded with the Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang clique, attempting to turn Shanghai into a "half of the country" for the development of capitalist reactionary literature. Over the past 17 years, this handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists who had infiltrated the Party, government, military, and various cultural circles, colluded with reactionary bourgeois academic and literary "authorities," usurped the leadership of the cultural circles, and used Beijing and Shanghai as their main strongholds for reactionary propaganda. They extended their black hands to various parts of the country, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat in the cultural realm and promoting "peaceful evolution." They enthusiastically praised imperialist, feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist reactionary literature; they enthusiastically supported a large number of anti-Party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds to serve the political needs of the counterrevolutionary revisionist clique within the Party and the anti-socialist needs of the bourgeoisie; they enthusiastically opposed Mao Zedong Thought, slandering it as "simplification" and "vulgarization," and advocating various bourgeois reactionary literary theories that had been condemned in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"; they enthusiastically glorified the ugly images of emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, zombies, demons, young masters, and young ladies, all representatives of the exploiting classes, on stage, and distorted or erased the great images of workers, peasants, and soldiers; they enthusiastically recruited and protected traitors, spies, collaborators, and corrupt elements, installing them in important positions and engaging in various unspeakable activities; they enthusiastically struck down all those who dared to rebel against them, striking down all those who dared to uphold Chairman Mao's literary line, hating them to the extreme, wishing to kill them with a single blow. Whatever Chairman Mao's instructions were, they either erased, distorted, altered, blocked, or resisted them; but they treated the words of the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and those bourgeois "big" intellectuals as sacred, obeying them without question. Over the past 17 years, this handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists have committed heinous crimes and done countless evil deeds! From praising "The Palace of Desire" to fabricating "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," they have a complete black history of opposing "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," opposing Mao Zedong's literary line, and attempting to restore capitalism!

Literature serving proletarian politics, in the period of socialist revolution, means serving to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and develop the socialist revolution, which is to use the proletarian face to transform the Party and the world. The core of the counterrevolutionary revisionist line is to use the bourgeois face to transform the Party and the world, dreaming of turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship and turning China into a colony of imperialism. As Chairman Mao pointed out, they wanted to stage a counterrevolutionary coup like the Petofi Club in Hungary.

Chairman Mao personally led the major literary struggles after liberation. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui." Chairman Mao's theory on launching a proletarian cultural revolution from below under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, starting from criticizing the bourgeois representatives in the ideological and cultural realm, exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and consolidating proletarian dictatorship, is a creative development of the spirit of "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" in the period of socialist revolution, a milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism, and a great innovation in the international communist movement. Now, the ugly faces of this handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists have finally been exposed in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Their conspiracies have been smashed.

In opposition to the bourgeois reactionary literary line represented by Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo-han, and Qi Yanming (i.e., the counterrevolutionary revisionist literary line), Comrade Jiang Qing has upheld the proletarian literary line expounded in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and has waged a tenacious struggle against the bourgeois reactionary literary line, making significant contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. She enthusiastically supported the new proletarian forces in the cultural circles that upheld the direction of "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." She dared to defy the various rules and regulations of the bourgeois reactionary authorities. The Peking opera revolution and other performing arts revolutions she led and initiated have stormed the most stubborn fortresses of bourgeois and feudal reactionary literature, creating a batch of brand-new revolutionary Peking operas, revolutionary ballets, and revolutionary symphonic music, setting shining examples for the literary revolution. These works are filled with proletarian revolutionary heroism, have high revolutionary and artistic qualities, possess unique national styles, are exemplary in innovation, and are powerful ideological weapons and precious cultural treasures of the proletariat. These works, on stages in China and around the world, have erected the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought high with typical images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, defeating the ghosts and demons of the exploiting classes on stage, leaving them in disarray and utterly defeated. The "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" is an extremely important document that has been revised by Chairman Mao multiple times. It uses Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major questions about the cultural revolution in the socialist period, fundamentally shattering the foundation of the counterrevolutionary revisionist literary line, and paving the way for the proletarian cultural revolution in the literary circles.

We, the proletarian revolutionary forces in Shanghai, feel very proud because many major battles were fought here. When the claws of the Peng Zhen counterrevolutionary revisionist clique controlled the old Beijing Municipal Committee, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, Comrade Jiang Qing initiated the criticism of the Peng Zhen counterrevolutionary revisionist clique in Shanghai, igniting the blazing torch of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must carry forward this proletarian revolutionary tradition and forever wage uncompromising struggles against all ghosts and demons.

In commemorating the 25th anniversary of "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must first seriously study Chairman Mao's great work and other great works on cultural revolution, using them as the most important weapons in our great criticism. We must thoroughly smash the positions occupied by the counterrevolutionary revisionist literary black line in politics, ideology, theory, and organization, eliminate their poison, uncover all their underground activities, and truly seize the leadership from the proletarian revolutionary forces. Furthermore, we must thoroughly criticize and expose the ultimate backer of the literary black line—the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party—and push the great criticism movement to a new high tide.

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are revolutionary and critical doctrines that have always opened up their paths of advancement in struggles against "left" and "right" opportunism and various bourgeois reactionary currents. Only by learning Mao Zedong Thought in struggles can we truly grasp the revolutionary soul of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by grasping Mao Zedong Thought can we deliver a fatal blow to the bourgeois reactionary line. All the victories of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are ultimately the victories of Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over bourgeois reactionary thoughts and bourgeois reactionary lines. Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces who are already in power must place the learning, grasping, and applying of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, never forgetting it, never stopping, and never allowing it to be crowded out by daily busy work.

The ideological front must be occupied with ideological weapons. Fists and smashing cannot eliminate bourgeois thoughts. Places occupied by bourgeois thoughts must be criticized and fought with Mao Zedong Thought to seize the positions for the proletariat. Masses poisoned, deceived, and hoodwinked by the bourgeois reactionary line must be educated with Mao Zedong Thought to awaken them, consciously eliminate erroneous thoughts from their minds, and return to Chairman Mao's line. Whether we can carry out the struggle on the ideological front well is a matter that relates to whether we can carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We must see that the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and their representatives in the ideological and cultural realms are very tenacious. The traditional influences of the exploiting classes and old habits will take a very long historical period to gradually eliminate. Even if the bourgeois representatives are dug out, their influences are not eliminated; even if the old bourgeois representatives are removed, new ones will emerge. Chairman Mao recently reminded us again: "The current cultural revolution is only the first one, and there will inevitably be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism may be imminent at any time. All Party members and the people of the nation must not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will bring eternal peace. Be extremely vigilant and never relax your revolutionary will! Never overlook the long-term nature of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism!" Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary forces, we must deeply contemplate this weighty instruction from Chairman Mao again and again, always keep it in our hearts, never forget it, never relax our revolutionary will with a sense of peace, and never overlook the long-term nature of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism! The history of class struggles tells us: literature is the most sensitive nerve of the class. Every round, every fluctuation, and every turning point of the political struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, is first reflected in literature. Wasn't it Chairman Mao who led us to expose the ugly faces of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party from the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," "The Palace of Desire," and other poisonous weeds? The work of great criticism in the literary realm must be carried out in depth. We must first criticize and detoxify the revisionist literary theories such as the "theory of all-people's literature," the "theory of writing about intermediate characters," and "humanism," those poisonous weeds directly praised, supported, cultivated, and utilized by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and the main works of the head of Soviet modern revisionism. The criticism and struggle on the literary front must be closely linked with the overall political struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and serve the needs of the proletarian political struggle.

Shanghai was the old nest of the literary black line in the 1930s and was long under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation; Shanghai is where the bourgeoisie and their intellectuals are most concentrated, where many bad plays, bad films, and bad books come from, and where many major struggles have broken out. Whether the great criticism on the literary front in Shanghai can be carried out well is related to whether we can uproot the literary black line in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and truly seize the various positions on the cultural front for the proletariat. We must not underestimate this. We must mobilize the masses on the ideological front, seize the key points, and fight battle after battle; at the same time, we must thoroughly investigate the political faces of the bad elements hidden in the cultural realm.

In commemorating the 25th anniversary of "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must better combine the two armies of literature and military.

Chairman Mao said in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, among which we can also say there are two fronts, namely the cultural front and the military front. We must defeat the enemy, first of all, by relying on the army with guns in their hands. But having only such an army is not enough; we must also have a cultural army, which is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." Chairman Mao pointed out that these two armies must "combine with each other." This is a very important strategic thought of Chairman Mao, which we must deeply understand. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must thoroughly defeat the enemy by relying on the good coordination, mutual support, and joint struggle of the two armies of literature and military. That is, we must support the army and love the people. We must firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, and under the command of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, the two armies of literature and military must closely unite. Then we can add wings like a tiger, smash all the resistance of the class enemies, and achieve new great victories.

In commemorating the 25th anniversary of "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must uphold Chairman Mao's direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of various units in the literary realm. The staff of literary troupes must seriously implement the "Regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Literary Troupes." According to the current situation of the struggle, the staff of literary troupes should return to their units, concentrate their efforts on thoroughly carrying out the revolution. On one hand, they should carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units, and on the other hand, they should create and rehearse modern revolutionary literary works and operas that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Currently, there is still a long and arduous journey before completing the struggle, criticism, and transformation in the literary realm. Class struggles are still sharp and complex, with ups and downs. The fundamental transformation of the literary realm lies in the unity with the workers, peasants, and soldiers as indicated in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of China, the literary and artistic workers with a future, must go to the masses, must go to the masses unconditionally, wholeheartedly, and forever, must go to the fiery struggle." "They must definitely shift their foothold, definitely in the process of deeply uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, deeply participating in the actual struggle, and learning Marxism and society, gradually shift over, shift to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, shift to the side of the proletariat." Our literary creation must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers; our literary troops must be transformed in the process of uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Currently, we advocate that literary workers return to their units to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation because if we do not carry out the cultural revolution well in each unit, do not deeply criticize and expose the counterrevolutionary revisionist literary black line, do not criticize and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road, and do not rectify and clean up the literary troops, the class lines will not be clear, and we will not be able to build a proletarian literary troop, and there will be no guarantee of unity with the workers, peasants, and soldiers. It should be pointed out that some literary workers and revolutionary intellectuals have united with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, served the workers, peasants, and soldiers, propagated Mao Zedong Thought, propagated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary forces there, achieving good results and receiving warm welcome from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the mainstream; but there are also a few who, taking advantage of the opportunity of "linking up," created chaos in factories and rural areas, incited armed struggles, and even advocated the rehabilitation of landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They did not, as Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," honestly learn from the proletarian revolutionary forces among the workers and peasants, honestly transform their non-proletarian thoughts, but regarded themselves as the masters of the masses, injecting a set of thoughts opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line into the masses, and striving to create divisions within the revolutionary forces. Shouldn't these few people seriously study "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and clean up their thoughts?

Literature is a weapon of class struggle. Proletarian literary works are powerful ideological weapons that use Mao Zedong Thought to unite the people, educate the people, strike down the enemies, and annihilate the enemies. Under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolutionary literary workers in Shanghai have bravely stormed the strongholds of the bourgeoisie and feudalism, creating outstanding revolutionary model operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Harbor," and "The White-Haired Girl" that embody Mao Zedong Thought. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and small performing troupes organized by the Red Guards and revolutionary literary workers in Shanghai have been active on various fronts, creating many short, concise, and combative programs, timely supporting the struggles of each stage, and receiving warm welcome from the broad masses. You are right, you have done well! In the future, we will continue to strive in both popularization and improvement. We should have such revolutionary ambitions: create model works reflecting this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Create outstanding works reflecting the January Revolution in Shanghai! Revolutionary musicians should create works reflecting the great revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary forces! We should have our own "Song of the Red Guards"! Revolutionary literary workers should create immortal images of proletarian heroes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! We should, in various aspects of literature, compose a resounding victory song after another for the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

In commemorating the 25th anniversary of "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must seriously implement the mass line in various aspects, strengthen self-transformation, and use the proletarian worldview to overcome various non-proletarian thoughts in our ranks.

Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" that the two fundamental issues of who to serve and how to serve are not only of universal significance to literary workers but also to all revolutionary comrades. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the focus of the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois reactionary line is the issue of attitude and stance towards the masses. Chairman Mao has repeatedly called on revolutionary cadres to "go to the masses." Obviously, only by solving these two issues can our work have the correct political direction. Only by solving these two issues can we prevent the "peaceful evolution" of capitalism and prevent the restoration of capitalism. We, the proletarian revolutionary forces, are not serving the interests of a small group but serving the interests of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. If the interests of a revolutionary mass organization do not coincide with the interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring people, we should make the partial interests subordinate to the overall interests, rather than the opposite. All revolutionary cadres should humbly learn from the masses, strongly support the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary masses, and resolutely fight against various bureaucratic habits of alienation from the masses. We should make every effort to constantly cleanse the dust of alienation from the masses in our ideological style. Chairman Mao taught us in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "All Communists, all revolutionaries, all revolutionary literary workers should learn from Lu Xun's example, be the 'ox' of the proletariat and the people, work tirelessly, and die only then." We should use this standard to examine ourselves, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, and constantly fight against the "self" in our minds with the thought of serving the people wholeheartedly.

Chairman Mao taught us in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" to distinguish between proletarian thoughts and petty-bourgeois thoughts. He said: "Many of our comrades are not very clear about the difference between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie." "We need to launch a struggle between proletarian and non-proletarian thoughts." "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a profound rectification report, a powerful ideological weapon for promoting the proletarianization of our thoughts.

Comrades of the revolutionary rebel factions in Shanghai, we must firmly grasp the grand direction of the struggle, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, consciously resist the infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois currents, overcome anarchism, factionalism, splitism, individualism, and other erroneous tendencies that hinder the great alliance of revolution. The fighters of the proletarian revolutionary forces should be good at distinguishing the boundaries between the proletarian worldview and various bourgeois, petty-bourgeois currents and other non-proletarian currents, do patient and detailed political and ideological work, guide some masses to use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome the influences of bourgeois, petty-bourgeois currents and other non-proletarian currents, and unite with them to advance together.

Chairman Mao pointed out: Only by achieving unity on fundamental principles, "and only by putting forward and implementing the slogan of serving the workers, peasants, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army, going to the masses," can we achieve the goal of overcoming sectarianism and uniting against the enemy. He quoted a passage from Lu Xun in "On the Speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "If our front cannot be unified, it proves that our goals cannot be consistent, or it is only for a small group, or it is actually only for the individual. If the goal is for the workers and peasants, then the front will definitely be unified." Chairman Mao's instructions not only have great guiding significance for the literary circles but also for us today to strengthen the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary forces. We, the proletarian revolutionary forces, must firmly direct our struggle against China's Khrushchev, against the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, against the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, unite in the common goal of struggle, unite with the broad revolutionary masses, advance bravely along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line!
Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!
Carry the great criticism through to the end!
Uphold the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers!
Long live the proletarian dictatorship!
Long live the Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是进行无产阶级文化大革命的革命纲领
    ——在上海纪念毛主席光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会上的讲话
    姚文元同志们！战友们！
    今天，在革命的大批判的高潮中，在无产阶级文化大革命进入向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击、总清算的时刻，在苏联现代修正主义无耻的叛徒行径和叛徒理论在全世界日益破产的时刻，我们上海的无产阶级革命派的战士，举行隆重的集会，来纪念毛主席的伟大著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，这是有重大历史意义和现实意义的。
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是毛泽东思想的光辉结晶，是马克思列宁主义的不朽文献，是对马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论的划时代的发展，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性的文件，是反对现代修正主义和一切资产阶级反动思想的纲领性文件，是鼓舞全世界被压迫人民向帝国主义和一切反动派进行勇敢冲击的响亮的战斗号角。
    《讲话》在全世界无产阶级文艺运动的历史上，第一次最明确、最完整、最彻底地提出了为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的根本方向，系统地解决了文艺工作者同工农兵结合的问题，解决了发展无产阶级文艺的一系列重大的、根本性的理论问题和实践问题。《讲话》全面地总结了文化战线上两条路线斗争的历史经验，彻底批判了长期在党内占统治地位的资产阶级文艺路线，全面地、深刻地制定了无产阶级文艺路线和各项具体政策。《讲话》高举马克思列宁主义的革命的批判的大旗，给予文艺、思想战线上形形色色资产阶级、修正主义的反动观点以摧毁性的打击，彻底揭露了周扬一伙三十年代文艺黑线的反动面目，这个批判是这样深刻、这样尖锐和有力量，是这样准确地击中了资产阶级反动世界观和文艺理论的核心和要害，使得以后的各种修正主义的反动思潮，包括《修养》所鼓吹的背叛无产阶级专政、贩卖阶级投降主义的反动论点，包括苏联现代修正主义奉为至宝的资产阶级人性论和人道主义，不管有多少伪装，多少变种，多少花言巧语，都逃不脱《讲话》这个照妖镜的无穷威力，只要一照，立刻现出丑恶的原形。《讲话》所指出的文艺工作者必须同工农兵结合、必须同新的群众的时代相结合、必须彻底改造自己世界观的道路，是一切愿意革命的知识分子走向革命化、无产阶级化的唯一道路，是发展无产阶级文化的唯一道路，也是反对和防止修正主义的根本保证。一切革命的干部、革命的文化工作者，都从这里找到了进行思想改造、同群众相结合的根本途径。《讲话》在解决各种复杂问题的时候，天才地创造性地运用和发展了马克思主义的辩证法，是我们学习在革命实践中运用辩证唯物论的一个光辉的典范。《讲话》是发展革命文化的万古常新的真理，是无产阶级文艺战无不胜的战斗旗帜，是进行思想、文化战线上的大革命的指南针。
    毛主席这篇伟大著作，同他的《新民主主义论》《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》，以及在社会主义革命时期发表的《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》等等伟大著作，直到进行这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的许多重要指示和文件，把马克思列宁主义世界观发展到一个崭新的阶段，开辟了一个发展无产阶级文艺、进行无产阶级文化革命的全新的历史时期。
    二十五年以来，在中国，在世界，《讲话》都发生了巨大的影响，它为一切革命的文艺工作者指明了前进的方向，给予形形色色反动资产阶级世界观以沉重的打击。《讲话》中对于工农兵群众伟大历史作用的评价和歌颂，对于什么“人类之爱”“人性论”等等资产阶级反动世界观的批判，帮助了全世界无产阶级和革命人民摆脱资产阶级和修正主义的欺骗，奋起为自己的解放而斗争。当然，这二十五年不是在风平浪静中渡过的。二十五年的历史，是充满着剧烈的阶级斗争的两条路线斗争的历史。彭真、陆定一、周扬等等反革命修正主义分子，以及大力支持他们的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，控制了旧中宣部、旧文化部、旧北京市委以及全国许多文化部门，疯狂地反对和抗拒《讲话》中所阐明的无产阶级文艺路线，抗拒毛主席历次关于文化问题的重要指示，疯狂地推行一条资产阶级反动文艺路线（即反革命修正主义文艺路线），为他们进行资本主义在全国复辟的罪恶事业作舆论准备。在上海，旧市委中一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，同样猖狂地抗拒毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，抵制毛主席关于批判混入党内的资产阶级代表人物的指示。他们还竭力反对和破坏柯庆施同志为坚持毛主席文艺路线而进行的斗争。他们同陆定一、周扬一伙相勾结，妄想把上海当作发展资本主义反动文艺的“半壁江山”。十七年来，这一小撮钻进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界里的反革命修正主义分子，同那些反动的资产阶级学术、文艺“权威”相勾结，篡夺了文化界的领导权，他们以北京、上海作为进行反动宣传的主要据点，把黑手伸向全国各地，在文化领域中，向无产阶级实行反革命的资产阶级专政，大搞“和平演变”。他们狂热地吹捧帝国主义、封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的反动文艺；他们狂热地支持一大批反党反社会主义的大毒草，为党内反革命修正主义集团政治需要服务，为资产阶级反社会主义的需要服务；他们狂热地反毛泽东思想，诬蔑宣传毛泽东思想是“简单化”“庸俗化”，鼓吹早已被《讲话》所痛斥过的各种资产阶级反动文艺理论；他们狂热地把帝王将相、才子佳人、僵尸魔鬼、少爷小姐总之一切剥削阶级的丑恶形象，搬上舞台加以美化，抹杀或者歪曲伟大的工农兵的形象；他们狂热地在文艺界中招降纳叛，包庇坏人，保护和发展资产阶级新贵族，把大批叛徒、汉奸、特务、里通外国分子、剥削阶级分子和蜕化变质分子，安插到重要岗位上，进行着种种不可告人的勾当；他们狂热地打击一切敢于起来造他们的反的“小人物”，打击一切敢于坚持毛主席文艺路线的人，仇恨已极，恨不得一棍子打死。凡是毛主席的指示，他们或抹杀，或歪曲，或篡改，或封锁，或抵制；但是对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和那些资产阶级“大”知识分子的话，却奉若神明，言听计从。十七年来，这一小撮反革命修正主义分子，罪恶滔天，干尽了坏事！从吹捧《清宫秘史》到炮制《海瑞罢官》，就是他们整整一部反对《讲话》、反对毛泽东文艺路线、进行资本主义复辟的黑历史！
    文艺为无产阶级政治服务，在社会主义革命时期，就是为巩固无产阶级专政、发展社会主义革命服务，就是要用无产阶级面貌改造党，改造世界。而反革命修正主义路线的核心，就是要用资产阶级的面貌改造党、改造世界，梦想变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，变中国为帝国主义的殖民地。正如毛主席一针见血地揭露过：他们想搞“象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样”的反革命政变。
    毛主席亲自领导了解放以后历次重大的文艺斗争。毛主席亲自发动和领导了对《海瑞罢官》的批判。毛主席关于在无产阶级专政条件下开展自下而上的无产阶级文化大革命，从批判思想文化领域中资产阶级代表人物入手，揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，防止资本主义复辟，巩固无产阶级专政的理论，是《讲话》的精神在社会主义革命时期创造性的发展，是马克思列宁主义划时代的发展，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举。现在，这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的丑恶面目，终于在这场无产阶级文化大革命中被揭露出来了。他们的阴谋被粉碎了。
    同以周扬、夏衍、林默涵、齐燕铭为代表的资产阶级反动文艺路线（即反革命修正主义文艺路线）相对立，江青同志坚持了《讲话》中阐明的毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，同资产阶级反动文艺路线进行了顽强不屈的斗争，对于无产阶级文化大革命作出了重大的贡献。她热情支持了文化界中那些坚持《讲话》方向的无产阶级的新生力量。她敢于反抗那些资产阶级反动权威的种种清规戒律。她所领导和发动的京剧革命、其他表演艺术的革命，攻克了资产阶级、封建阶级反动文艺的最顽固的堡垒，创造了一批崭新的革命京剧、革命芭蕾舞剧、革命交响音乐，为文艺革命树立了光辉的样板。这些作品充满了无产阶级的革命英雄气概，有高度的革命性和艺术性，具有独创的民族风格，是推陈出新的典范，是无产阶级有力的思想武器和珍贵的文化财富。这些作品在中国和全世界的舞台上，用典型的工农兵的英雄形象，高高地树立起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把舞台上那些剥削阶级的牛鬼蛇神打得个落花流水，一败涂地。《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，是一个经过毛主席多次修改的、极其重要的文件，它用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，从根本上粉碎了反革命修正主义文艺路线的基础，为文艺界的无产阶级文化大革命开辟了道路。
    我们上海无产阶级革命派感到很光荣，因为许多重大的战斗是在上海进行的。当彭真反革命修正主义集团的魔爪控制着旧北京市委时，根据毛主席的指示，江青同志在上海发动了对彭真反革命修正主义集团的批判，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊火炬。我们要发扬这种无产阶级革命传统，永远同一切牛鬼蛇神进行不调和的斗争。
    我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，首先要认真地学习毛主席这篇伟大著作和其他关于文化革命的伟大著作，当作我们进行大批判的最重要的战斗武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上、组织上彻底摧毁反革命修正主义文艺黑线所占据着的阵地，肃清它们的毒素，弄清它们的一切地下活动，把领导权真正夺到无产阶级革命派手中来，并且进一步彻底批臭文艺黑线的总后台——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把革命的大批判运动推向一个新的高潮。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想是革命的、批判的学说，它从来就是在同“左”右倾机会主义和形形色色资产阶级反动思潮的斗争中，开辟自己的前进的道路的。从斗争中来学习毛泽东思想，才能真正掌握毛泽东思想的革命的灵魂。只有掌握了毛泽东思想，才能给予资产阶级反动路线以致命的打击。我们无产阶级文化大革命的一切胜利，归根到底，都是毛泽东思想、以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线对于资产阶级反动思想和资产阶级反动路线的胜利。已经处在掌权地位的上海无产阶级革命派的同志们，一定要把学习、掌握、运用毛泽东思想，放到高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上，念念不忘，天天不停，切不可被日常的繁忙的事务挤掉了学习的时间。
    思想的阵地必须用思想的武器去占领。靠拳头，靠打砸，是不能够把资产阶级思想搞掉的。被资产阶级思想占领着的地方，必须用毛泽东思想去批判，去战斗，才能把阵地夺取到无产阶级手中。被资产阶级反动路线毒害、欺骗、蒙蔽的群众，只有用毛泽东思想去向他们进行思想教育，才能使他们觉醒过来，自觉地清除头脑里的错误思想，回到毛主席的路线上来。能不能把思想战线上的斗争搞好，这是关系到我们能不能把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的问题。
    应当看到，在思想、文化领域中的资产阶级的反动思想及其代表人物，是很顽强的。剥削阶级的传统影响，旧的习惯势力，要经过很长的历史时期，才能逐步消除。挖出了资产阶级代表人物，并不等于肃清了他们的影响；挖掉了旧的资产阶级代表人物，还会产生新的资产阶级代表人物。毛主席在最近又一次重复地提醒我们：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”对于毛主席这个语重心长的指示，我们无产阶级革命派的同志们，要再三地深思又深思，要永远铭刻在自己心里，千万不可忘记啊！千万不可以用太平观念、麻痹大意来松懈自己革命斗志啊！千万不能忽视无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义同资本主义两条道路斗争的长期性啊！阶级斗争的历史告诉我们：文艺是阶级的最敏锐的神经，无产阶级同资产阶级的政治斗争，社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，它的每一个回合，每一个起伏，每一个转折，总是首先从文艺上反映出来。毛主席不就是领导我们从批判《海瑞罢官》《清宫秘史》等大毒草中，揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶面目吗？文艺领域的大批判工作，还需要深入地进行下去。对于“全民文艺论”“写中间人物论”“人性论”之类的修正主义的文艺理论，对于那些直接为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所吹捧、所支持、所培植、所利用的大毒草，对于苏联现代修正主义的头子的主要作品，首先要进行批判和消毒。文艺战线上的批判和斗争，应当和文化大革命中整个政治斗争的形势密切联系起来，并为无产阶级的政治斗争的需要服务。
    上海是三十年代文艺黑线的老窝，解放前长期受帝国主义和国民党反动派的统治；上海是资产阶级及其知识分子最集中的地方，许多坏戏、坏电影、坏书出在上海，许多重大的斗争是在上海爆发的。上海文艺战线上的大批判能否搞好，关系到我们能不能在这一次文化大革命中挖掉文艺黑线的根子，能不能把文教战线的各个阵地真正夺到无产阶级手中。我们切不可轻视。我们要在思想战线上，发动广大群众，抓住重点，一仗一仗地打下去；同时应当把埋藏在文化领域中的坏人的政治面目清查清楚。
    我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，文武两支军队要更好地结合起来。
    毛主席在《讲话》中说：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”毛主席指出，这两支军队要“互相结合起来”。这是毛主席的一个极其重要的战略思想，我们要深刻地领会。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要彻底战胜敌人，也要依靠文、武两支军队很好地配合，相互支持，共同对敌。就是说，要拥军爱民。我们要坚决响应毛主席拥军爱民的伟大号召，在最高统帅毛主席的率领下，文、武两支军队紧密团结起来，我们就能如虎添翼，我们就能粉碎一切阶级敌人的反抗，夺取新的伟大的胜利。
    我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，要坚持毛主席的工农兵方向，搞好文艺领域各单位的斗批改的工作。文艺团体的工作人员，要认真贯彻《中共中央关于文艺团体无产阶级文化大革命的规定》。根据目前的斗争形势，文艺团体的工作人员，应当回到本单位，集中力量彻底闹革命。一面进行本单位的斗、批、改，一面创作和排演现代的革命化的为工农兵服务的文艺作品和戏曲等。
    目前，离开完成文艺界的斗批改，还有一段很长的很艰巨的路程。阶级斗争，还是很尖锐很复杂的，还是有反复的。文艺界的根本改造，在于《讲话》中指出的同工农兵相结合，正如毛主席指出的：“中国的革命的文学家艺术家，有出息的文学家艺术家，必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”，“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。”我们的文艺创作，必须为工农兵服务；我们文艺队伍，必须从同工农兵结合的过程中改造自己的立场和世界观。在目前，我们主张文艺工作者回到本单位进行斗批改，这是因为如果不把各个单位文化大革命搞好，不把反革命修正主义文艺黑线，不把资产阶级反动路线揭深批透，不把一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒批垮，不对文艺队伍进行一番整顿和清理，阶级阵线就不能分明，我们就不可能建设一支无产阶级的文艺队伍，同工农兵结合没有保证。应当指出：有一些文艺工作者、革命知识分子同工农兵结合，为工农兵服务，宣传毛泽东思想，宣传文化大革命，同工农兵打成一片，同那里的无产阶级革命派一同战斗，收到了很好的效果，受到了工农兵热烈的欢迎，这是主流；但也有极少数人，却利用“串连”的机会，到工厂、农村中制造混乱，挑动武斗，甚至为地富反坏右翻案，他们不是象毛主席在《讲话》中指出的那样，老老实实向工人、农民中的无产阶级革命派学习，老老实实地改造自己的非无产阶级思想，而是“把自己看作群众的主人”，向群众灌输了一套同毛主席无产阶级革命路线相敌对的思想，极力制造革命队伍的分裂。对于这极少数人，难道不应当好好地学习《讲话》、好好地清理一下自己的思想吗？
    文艺是阶级斗争的武器。无产阶级文艺作品是用毛泽东思想团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的思想武器。上海的革命文艺工作者，在江青同志率领下，向着资产阶级、封建阶级的顽固堡垒进行了勇敢的冲锋陷阵，创作了象《智取威虎山》《海港》《白毛女》这样体现毛泽东思想的优秀的革命样板戏。上海红卫兵战士、革命文艺工作者组织的毛泽东思想宣传队、文艺小分队，活跃在各条战线上，创造了许多短小精悍、富于战斗性的小节目，及时配合了各个阶段的斗争，受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。你们做得对，做得好！今后，我们在普及和提高两个方面，都要继续努力。我们应当有这样的革命的雄心壮志：创造出反映这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的样板作品！创造出反映上海一月革命风暴的优秀作品！革命的音乐工作者，应当创作出反映无产阶级革命派伟大革命精神的作品！我们应当有自己的《红卫兵之歌》！革命的文学工作者，应当塑造出在文化大革命中无产阶级英雄人物的不朽形象！我们应当在文艺的各个方面，为毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，谱出一曲又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    我们纪念《讲话》发表二十五周年，要认真地在各个方面贯彻群众路线，加强自我改造，用无产阶级世界观来克服我们队伍中的各种非无产阶级思想。
    毛主席在《讲话》中指出的为什么人服务和如何去服务这两个根本问题，不仅是对文艺工作者，而且是对一切革命工作的同志都是有普遍意义的。在这场无产阶级文化大革命中，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线斗争的焦点，就是一个对待群众的立场和态度问题。毛主席多次号召革命的干部要“到群众中去”。显然，只有解决了这两个问题，我们的工作才能有正确的政治方向。只有解决了这两个问题，才能防止资本主义的“和平演变”，防止资本主义复辟。我们无产阶级革命派，决不是为一个小团体的利益服务，而是为无产阶级和广大革命群众的利益服务，如果一个革命群众团体的利益同无产阶级和广大劳动人民利益不符合，应当使局部利益服从整体利益，而不应当是相反。一切革命干部要虚心向群众学习，大力支持革命群众的首创精神，同脱离群众的各种官僚主义习气作坚决斗争，要用极大的努力，不断清洗我们思想作风上脱离群众的灰尘。毛主席在《讲话》中教导我们说：“一切共产党员，一切革命家，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该学鲁迅的榜样，做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”我们要用这个标准检查自己，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，用全心全意为人民服务的思想，不断同头脑里的“私”字作斗争。
    毛主席在《讲话》中，谆谆教导我们，要划清无产阶级思想同小资产阶级思想的区别。他说：“我们有许多同志还不大清楚无产阶级和小资产阶级的区别。”
  “需要展开一个无产阶级对非无产阶级的思想斗争。”
  《讲话》是一篇深刻的整风报告。是促进我们思想无产阶级化的强大的思想武器。　
    上海革命造反派的同志，要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，巩固和发展革命的大联合，自觉地克服资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮的侵蚀，克服无政府主义、小团体主义、分裂主义、个人主义等等阻碍革命的大联合的错误倾向。无产阶级革命派的战士，要善于分清无产阶级世界观同形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮及其他非无产阶级思潮的界限，作耐心的、细致的政治思想工作，引导一些群众用毛泽东思想去克服资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮及其他非无产阶级思潮的影响，团结他们共同前进。
    毛主席指出：只有在根本原则问题上取得一致，“也只有把为工农，为八路军、新四军，到群众中去的口号提出来，并加以切实的实行”，才能达到克服宗派主义、联合对敌的目的。他在《讲话》中引了鲁迅的一段话：“我们战线不能统一，就证明我们的目的不能一致，或者只为了小团体，或者还其实只为了个人。如果目的都在工农大众，那当然战线也就统一了。”毛主席的指示，不仅对于文艺界，对于我们今天加强无产阶级革命派的大联合，也有极大的指导意义。我们无产阶级革命派，一定要把斗争矛头紧紧对准中国的赫鲁晓夫，对准党内走资本主义道路的当权派，对准以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，在共同的斗争目标中，联合起来，团结广大革命群众，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线勇敢前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线胜利万岁！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    把革命的大批判进行到底！
    坚持为工农兵服务的方向！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！
