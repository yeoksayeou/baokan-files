The proletarian revolutionary forces in Heilongjiang Province, through fierce and sharp struggles during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have formed a powerful and formidable fighting force on the basis of great unity. They have swept away the power of a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee and Provincial People's Committee, established a revolutionary "three-in-one" provisional power organ—the Revolutionary Committee—and grasped the destiny of proletarian dictatorship in Heilongjiang Province. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary forces across the province are launching a powerful attack on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, while at the same time criticizing and struggling against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and socialist construction in Heilongjiang Province are showing a very good situation.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented socialist revolution. In this great revolution, various political forces are recombining. How to identify the proletarian revolutionary forces and resolutely stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces is a crucial issue facing revolutionary cadres.

The Party Central Committee, in its decision on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, points out:

Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution.

The Party leadership must be good at discovering the leftists, developing and strengthening the leftist forces, and resolutely relying on the revolutionary leftists. Only in this way can we, in the movement, thoroughly isolate the most reactionary rightists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, and through the movement, ultimately unite more than 95% of the cadres and more than 95% of the masses.

In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I have been able to stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary forces, breathe the same air, share the same fate, fight together, and win together. This is under the personal guidance of Chairman Mao and the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, through practical struggles, constantly recognizing and constantly improving.

Identifying Proletarian Revolutionary Forces in Struggle

In this life-and-death class struggle that concerns the fate of our country, various political forces will inevitably use all kinds of means to tenaciously express themselves. If they do not express themselves, it is impossible. To identify who are the proletarian revolutionary forces and who are the conservatives, we must participate in the actual struggle, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and use the method of class analysis to distinguish them.

In the political center of Heilongjiang Province, Harbin City, the confrontation between various political forces first manifested in their attitudes towards the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee. When the revolutionary masses began to expose the class struggle cover of the Provincial Party Committee, the original Provincial Party Committee issued a "Notice" on August 16, 1966, asking the masses to discuss whether the Provincial Party Committee was revolutionary. This was a carefully planned conspiracy by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, attempting to suppress the revolutionary masses, incite the masses to fight the masses, and protect themselves. The Red Rebel Corps, on the one hand, saw through this conspiracy and firmly opposed this "Notice"; while the "August 8th Corps," on the other hand, supported this "Notice" and put forward the slogan "Defend the Provincial Party Committee" (in reality, defend the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee). One wanted to oppose, the other wanted to defend, the two sides faced off, the lines were clear. From then on, these two political forces engaged in fierce struggles on a series of major issues. I stood on the side of the Red Rebel Corps and firmly supported their revolutionary actions. The faction led by the "August 8th Corps," on the one hand, directed their arrows at me, struggling against me, and on the other hand, attacked the Red Rebel Corps.

In this situation, some people who appeared to be "impartial" and "neutral" also came out to express themselves, forming their own organizations. On the surface, they neither supported the Red Rebel Corps nor the "August 8th Corps." They said: The spirit of daring to rebel of the Rebel Corps is good, the general direction is correct, but the Rebel Corps fights recklessly, without policies and strategies; the "August 8th Corps" is steady, with strategies, but conservative. In the struggle, they swayed between the two sides. When the Red Rebel Corps developed smoothly, they leaned towards the Rebel Corps; when the Red Rebel Corps encountered difficulties, they leaned towards the "August 8th Corps."

At the same time, the ghosts and snakes in society, thinking the time had come, emerged one after another. They deceived the masses, recruited soldiers, established reactionary organizations such as the "Red Flag Army," "Restoration Army," and "Preparedness Army." They colluded with conservatives, attacked the proletarian revolutionary forces, squandered state property, disrupted production, engaged in beating, smashing, and looting, and created a white terror.

At the most intense and critical moment of the struggle, the voice of the great leader Chairman Mao came: Thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line. This gave the proletarian revolutionary forces great support and encouragement. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao increasingly penetrated the hearts of the people, and more and more deceived masses awakened and turned to the proletarian revolutionary forces. The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party felt their end was coming and struggled desperately. The conservative organizations also engaged in "left" in form but right in essence struggles. When they lost the masses and were extremely isolated, some members of the "August 8th Corps" even colluded with reactionary organizations such as the "Red Flag Army" to engage in sabotage activities, attempting to seize power. But they ultimately failed.

Chairman Mao teaches us: Revolutionary parties and forces are initially in the minority, but the most promising are they. Throughout the struggle, conservative organizations changed from large to small, intermediate organizations split into two extremes and disintegrated; while the proletarian revolutionary mass organizations changed from small to large, from weak to strong.

From the struggle, it can be seen that the proletarian revolutionary forces have the following common characteristics.

They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao, follow the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, and resolutely implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The Red Rebel Corps, in the struggle to criticize the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, in the struggle of "grasp revolution, promote production," opposing economism, and in the struggle of united seizure of power, always took the Sixteen Points as the guideline, and acted strictly according to the teachings of Chairman Mao and the instructions of the Party Central Committee.

Their struggle is always directed at the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, insisting on criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. Even when they were besieged and oppressed, they remained steadfast and unshakable.

They are the ones who have come out in the revolution, who truly dare to rebel and dare to revolt. They are the ones who, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, educate themselves, liberate themselves, and, in fierce class struggles, ignite and connect, developing from a few to many and growing stronger.

They insist on truth, correct mistakes, and pay attention to policies and strategies. After each major battle, they open the door for rectification, and have now conducted three rectifications. They say, the revolution cannot be overturned, those who do not revolutionize and do not follow Chairman Mao will be overturned and deserve it. Through rectification, the proletarian revolutionary forces have promoted their ideological revolutionization, further enhancing their fighting capacity.

Chairman Mao teaches us to look at the "essential and mainstream aspects" of a problem, and not to "emphasize non-essential and non-mainstream aspects." Identifying whether they are proletarian revolutionary forces or conservatives mainly depends on their general direction, their mainstream, and whether they stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao or on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line in this struggle.

For proletarian revolutionary organizations, we cannot just look at one time or one event; we must observe comprehensively and analyze concretely. They also make mistakes sometimes, and we cannot attack one point and ignore the rest; we must look at their general direction, distinguish between the mainstream and the sidestreams, and distinguish between the entire organization and individuals.

With the deepening of class struggle, every mass organization will change. Some revolutionary mass organizations always insist on the general direction of the struggle, but a few wavering and opportunistic elements will split off at critical moments of the struggle. Some mass organizations have the correct general direction of struggle for a period, but due to being usurped by some people with ulterior motives, the general direction of struggle is changed, and they turn to the opposite side. Some conservative organizations, after splitting, many deceived masses will turn to the proletarian revolutionary forces. In the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution on the economic front, class relationships are relatively clear. Landlords and peasants, capitalists and workers, are all clear. But in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front, various political forces are constantly undergoing drastic changes, and the situation is extremely complicated. As revolutionary cadres, we must keep a clear mind and "use the basic viewpoint of Marxism, that is, the method of class analysis," to constantly analyze these changes.

Supporting and Relying on Proletarian Revolutionary Forces in Struggle

The proletarian revolutionary forces are the revolutionary pioneers who have emerged in the Cultural Revolution. They have courage, wisdom, and have made great achievements for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, they are constantly tempered and grown. Among them, we can cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. We, the older generation of revolutionary cadres, should be delighted, humbly learn from them, wholeheartedly care for them, help them, and resolutely rely on them. Together, we will defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and advance in the great winds and waves of struggle.

Discovering the proletarian revolutionary forces, supporting and relying on the proletarian revolutionary forces, first of all, one must be a firm proletarian revolutionary force. If one is afraid of the masses and afraid of the revolution, one will try to cover up one's own mistakes and stand on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, protecting the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In this way, one can only be in harmony with conservative organizations and incompatible with the proletarian revolutionary forces. Only by daring to revolutionize, fearing nothing, and firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line can one establish a deep emotional bond with the proletarian revolutionary forces, be consistent with them in stance and feelings, and wholeheartedly support their every revolutionary action.

Supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces is, above all, supporting them in political and ideological terms with Mao Zedong Thought, helping them analyze the situation, grasp the general direction of the struggle, and policies and strategies. Those who have temporarily deviated can be helped to turn around. Last October, when I returned to Harbin from Beijing, I found that in the struggle to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, some in the Red Rebel Corps directed their arrows at the "August 8th Corps" and put forward the slogan "uproot and sweep away." I made a broadcast speech, proposing to direct the focus of the struggle at the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee and Municipal Party Committee. At that time, some in the Red Rebel Corps said my speech was a big poisonous weed and led a team to the streets. After patient explanation and persuasion, they accepted the advice and corrected their direction. When there are differences within the proletarian revolutionary forces, we use Mao Zedong Thought to help them, promoting their great unity on the premise of a consistent struggle target. In short, use Mao Zedong Thought to help the revolutionary youth grow and become strong, making them loyal defenders and resolute executors of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Firmly fight alongside the proletarian revolutionary forces. When the proletarian revolutionary forces are attacked by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee, reactionary organizations, and conservative organizations, we stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces, support them, protect them, and struggle with them. Last August 16, when I returned to Harbin, the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the original Provincial Party Committee incited workers who did not understand the truth to besiege the Red Rebel Corps, and I immediately did the work, persuading the workers and protecting the Red Rebel Corps. On September 7, some deceived workers, incited by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, again besieged the Red Rebel Corps, and I found the workers for a talk, persuading them. On December 5, reactionary organizations and conservative organizations hijacked more than a hundred trucks, arrested and beat people, creating a white terror. We, together with the proletarian revolutionary forces, launched a political offensive, won over the deceived masses, and arrested a few ringleaders. The Garrison Command conducted day and night armed patrols, supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces. The revolutionary masses excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!"

Supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces requires "daring" rather than "fearing." Supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces will inevitably be opposed by the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, reactionary organizations, and conservative organizations. In this situation, one must make up one's mind, overcome all difficulties, fear neither besieging nor impact. Some within the original Provincial Party Committee did not support the revolutionary forces but supported the conservative forces. I supported the revolutionary forces, and the struggle within the Provincial Party Committee was very intense. Some came to my home under the pretext of checking household registration, took away the names of students from the Red Rebel Corps who came to my place, conducted reconnaissance at my residence to see which members of the Red Rebel Corps came to my home. The "August 8th Corps" took turns besieging and struggling against me, once not allowing me to eat or rest for four days and four nights, damaging my eyes and body. I was in the military hospital, and the "August 8th Corps" first ransacked my home and then stormed the hospital to arrest me. All this did not make me yield. Firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces means not fearing struggle. Some people want to stand above all factions and engage in compromise, but the essence is fearing struggle. Fear of struggle is actually standing on the side of the conservatives. This is a matter of class stance and worldview. On this issue, if there is any wavering, one will inevitably commit a serious error.

While supporting and relying on the proletarian revolutionary forces, we must also do the work of conservative organizations, strive to educate the deceived masses, unite the majority, and strengthen the forces of the proletarian revolutionary forces. Chairman Mao teaches us to strive to unite all those who can be united, "The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all mankind. If it cannot liberate all mankind, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated." I used various opportunities to patiently do political and ideological work for the masses of the "August 8th Corps," holding talks with them and having individual heart-to-heart talks. I propagated Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to them, sincerely criticized their errors and shortcomings, and urged them to correctly view the revolutionary actions of the Red Rebel Corps, encouraging them to bravely correct their own mistakes, eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, unite against the enemy, and direct their arrows at the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At the same time, I also held talks in the ranks of the Red Rebel Corps, helping them strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions, recognizing that the contradictions between the masses of conservative organizations and them are contradictions within the people, and urging them, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades," to correctly treat the deceived masses within the "August 8th Corps." These masses are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. For the ideological problems of these masses, one can only persuade, not coerce. Many fighters of the Red Rebel Corps broadly contacted the masses of the "August 8th Corps," had heart-to-heart talks, and conducted painstaking and detailed political and ideological work on their active thoughts. The facts have proven that with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, they can be won over and educated. Most of the deceived masses who did so woke up and stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The People's Liberation Army is personally created by Chairman Mao and personally led by Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, a force that can be most trusted. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always firmly standing on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, giving great support to the proletarian revolutionary forces. At critical moments of the struggle, they stood up, with a clear stance and distinct banner, doing a great deal of work and making outstanding contributions in supporting the proletarian revolutionary forces in their struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In the struggle, when I was in difficulty, Commander Wang Jiadao of the Military Region gave me great support and help. The revolutionary masses have deep class feelings for the People's Liberation Army, they deeply trust the People's Liberation Army, regard the People's Liberation Army as their strongest backbone, and regard it as the pillar of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We revolutionary cadres and revolutionary mass organizations must closely cooperate with the army, cherish the army, and learn well from the People's Liberation Army.

After the victory of the seizure of power, the struggle between the two classes and the two lines still exists, and sometimes it is very sharp and complex. These struggles will continue to be reflected within the Revolutionary Committee and within the proletarian revolutionary forces. In the struggle, "firmly rely on the revolutionary leftists, win over the middle elements, unite the majority, concentrate forces, and strike at the small number of most reactionary rightists," this is a set line. It should be done this way when seizing power and also when in power. To establish a power organ that is extremely proletarianized, extremely combat-ready, most rich in revolutionary spirit, most efficient in work, and most able to serve the people, we must, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, implement the policy of revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and establish the Revolutionary Committee. In this Revolutionary Committee, there must be representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, representatives of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres. The participation of PLA cadres in the Revolutionary Committee can bring the experience of the PLA in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, the Four Firsts, and the Three-Eight Style to the Revolutionary Committee. The participation of representatives of revolutionary mass organizations in the Revolutionary Committee can represent the masses and connect with the masses, making the Revolutionary Committee have a broad mass base. We must prevent the phenomenon of reducing or even eliminating the representatives of revolutionary mass organizations. Only in this way can we consolidate the fruits of the seizure of power and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the issue of revolutionary cadres identifying, supporting, and relying on the proletarian revolutionary forces is, in the final analysis, a matter of stance and worldview. Only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, removing the official airs, humbly being a student, putting "daring" first, fearing no besieging, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminating the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, and completely shifting one's stance to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, can one firmly and unshakably support and rely on the proletarian revolutionary forces, fight and win together with them, make one's due contribution to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and pass the severe test of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    坚定地同无产阶级革命派站在一起
    潘复生
    黑龙江省无产阶级革命派，在无产阶级文化大革命中，通过激烈的尖锐的斗争，在大联合的基础上形成了一支浩浩荡荡的强大的战斗队伍，所向披靡，夺了原省委、省人委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，组成了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——革命委员会，掌握了黑龙江省无产阶级专政的命运。目前，全省的无产阶级革命派，正以排山倒海之势，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派展开猛烈的攻击，并结合批判斗争原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。黑龙江省无产阶级文化大革命和社会主义建设，呈现一派大好形势。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场史无前例的社会主义大革命。在这场大革命中，各派政治力量，重新组合。如何识别无产阶级革命派，坚决地站在无产阶级革命派一边，是摆在革命领导干部面前的一个头等重要的问题。
    党中央在关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定中指出：
    谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。
    党的领导要善于发现左派，发展和壮大左派队伍，坚决依靠革命的左派。这样，才能够在运动中，彻底孤立最反动的右派，争取中间派，团结大多数，经过运动，最后达到团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结百分之九十五以上的群众。
    我在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，能够坚定地同无产阶级革命派站在一起，同呼吸，共命运，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，是在毛主席的亲切教导下，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，通过斗争实践，不断认识，不断提高的。
    在斗争中识别无产阶级革命派
    在这场关系到我们国家命运的你死我活的阶级斗争中，各派政治力量，一定要用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己，要他们不表现，是不可能的。要识别哪些是无产阶级革命派，哪些是保守派，就要求我们参加到实际斗争中去，以毛泽东思想为指导，用阶级分析的方法加以辨别。
    在黑龙江省的政治中心哈尔滨市，各派政治力量的对立，首先是在对待原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的态度上表现出来的。在革命群众开始揭原省委阶级斗争盖子的时候，原省委在一九六六年八月十六日，发出了一个“通知”，要群众讨论省委是不是革命的。这是原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派精心策划的一个大阴谋，企图压制革命群众，挑动群众斗群众，保护自己。以红色造反团为一方，识破了这个阴谋，坚决反对这个“通知”；而以“八·八”团为另一方，则赞成这个“通知”，并提出“坚决保卫省委”（实际上是保省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派）的口号。一个要反，一个要保，两军对垒，阵线分明。从此，这两派政治力量在一系列的重大问题上针锋相对地展开了激烈斗争。我站在红色造反团一边，坚决支持他们的革命行动。以“八·八”团为首的一派，一方面把矛头指向了我，斗争我，另一方面围攻红色造反团。
    在这种形势下，一些貌似“公正”、“不偏不倚”的人，也站出来表现自己，成立了自己的组织。他们表面上既不赞成红色造反团，又不赞成“八·八”团。他们说：造反团敢于造反的精神是好的，大方向是对的，但是，造反团猛打猛冲，不讲政策和策略；“八·八”团稳，讲策略，但是保守。在斗争中，他们左右摇摆。红色造反团发展顺利时，他们靠近造反团；红色造反团遇到困难时，他们靠近“八·八”团。
    与此同时，社会上的牛鬼蛇神，以为时机已到，纷纷出笼。他们欺骗群众，招兵买马，建立反动组织“红旗军”、“荣复军”、“战备军”。他们拉拢保守派，打击无产阶级革命派，挥霍国家财产，破坏生产，实行打、砸、抢，大搞白色恐怖。
    在斗争最激烈最紧张的关头，传来了伟大领袖毛主席的声音：彻底批判资产阶级反动路线。这给予无产阶级革命派极大的支持和鼓舞。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线越来越深入人心，受蒙蔽的群众越来越多地觉悟起来，转向无产阶级革命派。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派感到自己的末日来临，进行垂死挣扎。保守组织也大搞形“左”实右的斗争。当他们失掉群众，十分孤立的时候，“八·八”团的极少数人甚至同“红旗军”等反动组织勾结起来，进行破坏活动，妄图夺取政权。但是，他们终于失败了。
    毛主席教导我们：革命政党和力量，在开始时都是处于少数地位的，但最有前途的就是他们。在整个斗争过程中，保守组织由大变小，中间组织向两极分化，最后解体；而无产阶级革命群众组织则由小变大，由弱变强。
    从斗争中可以看出，无产阶级革命派具有以下的共同特点。
    他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席，紧跟以毛主席为首的党中央，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。红色造反团在批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，在批判资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，在“抓革命，促生产”，反对经济主义的斗争中，在联合夺权的斗争中，始终以十六条为纲，不折不扣地按照毛主席的教导，按照党中央的指示办事。
    他们斗争的矛头始终指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，坚持批判资产阶级反动路线，即使在被围攻被压迫的时候，他们仍然坚定不移，毫不动摇。
    他们是在革命中闯出来的，是真正敢于革命，敢于造反的。他们是在毛泽东思想指导下，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，在激烈的阶级斗争中，点火、串连，由少数到多数发展壮大起来的。
    他们坚持真理，修正错误，注意政策和策略。在每次大的战斗之后，就开门整风，到现在已经进行了三次。他们说，革命的整不垮，不革命、不紧跟毛主席的整垮了活该。经过整风，促进了无产阶级革命派的思想革命化，更进一步增强了战斗力。
    毛主席教导我们，要看“问题的本质方面，主流方面”，而不要“强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西”。识别无产阶级革命派还是保守派，主要看他们的大方向，看他们的主流，看他们在这场斗争中，是站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边。
    对于无产阶级革命派组织，不能只看一时一事，要全面观察，具体分析。他们也有做错事的时候，不能攻其一点，不及其余，要看他们的大方向，要分清主流和支流，要分清整个组织和个别人。
    随着阶级斗争的深入发展，每个群众组织都会发生变化。有的革命群众组织，始终坚持斗争的大方向，而其中极少数动摇分子、投机分子，在斗争的紧要关头会分化出去。有的群众组织，在一段时间里斗争的大方向是正确的，但是，由于被一些别有用心的人篡夺了领导权，转移了斗争大方向，走向了自己的反面。一些保守组织，经过分化，许多受蒙蔽的群众会转到无产阶级革命派方面来。在民主革命和经济战线上的社会主义革命中，阶级关系是比较明显的。地主和农民，资本家和工人，都是一目了然的。而在政治思想战线上的社会主义革命中，各派政治力量不断地发生急剧的变动，情况极其错综复杂。作为革命领导干部，应当保持清醒的头脑，“用马克思主义的基本观点，即阶级分析的方法”，不断地分析这种变化。
    在斗争中支持和依靠无产阶级革命派
    无产阶级革命派，是在文化大革命中涌现出来的革命闯将。他们有魄力，有智慧，为无产阶级文化大革命建立了丰功伟绩。他们在毛泽东思想哺育下，不断地锻炼成长。在他们当中，可以培养造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我们老一代的革命干部，应当为此而欢欣鼓舞，虚心地向他们学习，满腔热情地关怀他们，帮助他们，坚决地依靠他们，同他们一起，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在斗争的大风大浪中前进。
    发现无产阶级革命派，支持和依靠无产阶级革命派，首先自己就必须是一个坚定的无产阶级革命派。如果害怕群众，害怕革命，就会极力掩饰自己的错误，就会站在资产阶级反动路线一边，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这样，就只能同保守组织情投意合，同无产阶级革命派格格不入。只有敢于革命，无所畏惧，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，才能同无产阶级革命派建立战斗的深情厚谊，从立场上、感情上和他们一致，热情地支持他们的每一个革命行动。
    支持无产阶级革命派，最根本的是在政治思想上用毛泽东思想去支持他们，帮助他们分析形势，掌握斗争大方向和政策、策略。一时转了向的，可以帮助他们扭转过来。去年十月，我从北京回到哈尔滨，发现红色造反团在批判资产阶级反动路线中，有的把矛头指向“八·八”团，提出“上揪下扫”的口号。我做了一次广播讲话，提出把斗争的重点，指向原省委、市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。当时，红色造反团有人说我的讲话是大毒草，并拉大队上街。经耐心解释说服，他们接受了意见，端正了方向。在无产阶级革命派内部发生分歧的时候，我们就用毛泽东思想帮助他们，促进他们在斗争目标一致的前提下的大联合。总之，用毛泽东思想帮助革命小将成长壮大，使他们成为毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的忠实的捍卫者和坚决的执行者。
    坚决同无产阶级革命派战斗在一起。当无产阶级革命派遭到原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、反动组织以及保守组织的打击时，我们站在无产阶级革命派一边，支持他们，保护他们，同他们一起斗争。去年八月十六日我回到哈尔滨，原省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派挑动不明真相的工人围攻红色造反团，我就马上做工作，劝阻工人，保护红色造反团。九月七日，一些受蒙蔽的工人，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的挑动下，又围攻红色造反团，我就找工人座谈，说服他们。十二月五日，反动组织以及保守组织劫持一百多辆汽车，捕人打人，搞白色恐怖。我们同无产阶级革命派一起开展政治攻势，争取受蒙蔽的群众，把个别的祸首抓起来。卫戍司令部昼夜武装巡逻，支持无产阶级革命派。革命群众激动地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“向人民解放军致敬！”
    支持无产阶级革命派，要“敢”字当头，不要“怕”字当头。支持无产阶级革命派，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派、反动组织以及保守组织就会反对，这是必然的。在这种情况下，就要下定决心，排除万难，不怕围攻，不怕冲击。原省委内有一些人不支持革命派，支持保守派。我支持革命派，省委内部斗争很激烈。有人到我家以查户口为名，把到我处的红色造反团的同学的名字抄走，在我住的地方搞侦察，看有哪些红色造反团的人到我家去。“八·八”团轮番围攻斗争我，有一次四天四夜不让我吃饭、休息，眼睛搞坏了，身体搞垮了。我住军区医院，“八·八”团先抄了我的家，然后冲医院捉我。这一切都没有使我屈服。坚决支持无产阶级革命派，就是要不怕挨斗争。有的人想站在几派之上，搞调和折中，其实质是害怕斗争。而害怕斗争，实际上是站到了保守派的一边。这个问题，是阶级立场问题，世界观问题。在这个问题上，如稍有动摇，非犯大错误不可。
    在支持和依靠无产阶级革命派的同时，必须做保守组织的工作，争取教育受蒙蔽的群众，团结大多数，壮大无产阶级革命派的队伍。毛主席教导我们，要争取团结一切可以团结的人们，“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。”我利用各种机会，耐心地向“八·八”团的群众做政治思想工作，找他们开座谈会，个别谈心。向他们宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，诚恳地批评他们的错误和缺点，要他们正确看待红色造反团的革命行动，鼓励他们勇敢地改正自己的错误，清除资产阶级反动路线的流毒，尽快地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，团结对敌，把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。同时，我在红色造反团战士中也召开座谈会，帮助他们严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，认识保守组织的群众同他们的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，要他们本着毛主席“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的教导，正确对待“八·八”团中受蒙蔽的群众，这些群众也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。对待这些群众中的思想问题，只能说服，不能压服。不少红色造反团的战士，广泛地同“八·八”团的群众接触，互相谈心，针对他们的活思想进行艰苦细致的政治思想工作。事实证明，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想一定能够把他们争取教育过来。凡是这样做了的，绝大多数受蒙蔽的群众醒悟过来了，纷纷退出了保守组织，站到了无产阶级革命派一边。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的，是毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志亲自领导的一支最可信赖的力量。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，黑龙江省军区高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，始终坚定地站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，给无产阶级革命派以巨大的支持。在斗争的关键时刻，他们挺身而出，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，在支持无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，做了大量的工作，做出了卓越的贡献。在斗争中，我处于困难的时候，军区司令员汪家道同志给了我极大的支持和帮助。革命群众对人民解放军有着深厚的阶级感情，他们无限信赖人民解放军，把人民解放军看作是自己最坚强的后盾，看作是保卫无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。我们革命领导干部和革命群众组织，要同军队密切配合，要爱护军队，要好好地向人民解放军学习。
    夺权斗争胜利后，两个阶级、两条路线的斗争仍然存在，有时还很尖锐复杂。这些斗争，还会不断地在革命委员会内部、无产阶级革命派内部反映出来。在斗争中，“坚定地依靠革命的左派，争取中间派，团结大多数，集中力量，打击一小撮最反动的右派”，这是一条既定的路线。在夺权的时候要这样做，在掌权的时候也要这样做。为了建立一个非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化，最富有革命精神，最富有办事效能，最能为人民服务的政权组织，必须按照毛主席的教导，实行革命的“三结合”方针，建立革命委员会。在这个革命委员会中，要有革命群众组织的代表，要有人民解放军的代表，要有革命的领导干部。解放军干部参加革命委员会，可以把解放军活学活用毛主席著作的经验、四个第一、三八作风带到革命委员会来。革命群众组织的代表参加革命委员会，可以代表群众，联系群众，使革命委员会有广泛的群众基础。我们要防止革命群众组织代表减少，甚至把革命群众组织的代表挤掉的现象发生。只有这样，才能巩固夺权的成果，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，革命领导干部识别、支持和依靠无产阶级革命派的问题，归根到底是一个立场问题，世界观问题。只有活学活用毛主席著作，打掉官架子，甘当小学生，“敢”字当头，不怕围攻，彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，清除资产阶级反动路线的流毒，把自己的立场完全转到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线这一边来，才能坚定不移地支持和依靠无产阶级革命派，才能同他们战斗在一起，胜利在一起，对无产阶级文化大革命做出自己应有的贡献，经受这一场无产阶级文化大革命的严峻考验。
