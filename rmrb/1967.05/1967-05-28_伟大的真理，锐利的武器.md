The first public release of Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art creatively develops Marxist-Leninist literary theory and the Marxist-Leninist theory of class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. It serves as a guide to defeating the ideology of the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes, developing socialist literature and art, preventing revisionist elements from usurping the party and the state, and consolidating proletarian dictatorship. It is a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao expounded on the theory of contradictions, classes, and class struggle in socialist society. He pointed out: Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention. Those who seek to overthrow a regime always first create public opinion and do ideological work. Revolutionary classes do this, and counterrevolutionary classes do the same.

This extremely profound point tells us: In socialist society, class struggle is concentrated on the struggle between the proletariat, which seeks to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, and the bourgeoisie, which seeks to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. The bourgeoisie's criminal activities to overthrow proletarian dictatorship always begin with creating public opinion and doing ideological work, and they always emphasize the use of literature and art as a weapon.

Over the past seventeen years since the founding of the nation, the literary and artistic front has seen one shocking class struggle after another, all revolving around the issue of state power. The batch of counterrevolutionary revisionists on the ideological and cultural front, such as Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, and the counterrevolutionary revisionist leader of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, who were supported by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, engaged in activities in drama, film, novels, and literary theory to create public opinion for overthrowing proletarian dictatorship. Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, proletarian revolutionary fighters on the literary and artistic front have been fighting to eliminate counterrevolutionary revisionist public opinion and consolidate proletarian dictatorship.

As early as 1944, in his letter to the Yan'an Drama Troupe after watching "Adventures of the Water Margin," Chairman Mao pointed out: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all old literature and art that is divorced from the people), the people are reduced to dregs, ruled by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted by you, restoring the true face of history. From now on, old drama has a new life, so it is worth celebrating. Your beginning will be the beginning of a new era for old drama. I am very happy to think of this and hope you will write and perform more, creating a trend and spreading it nationwide!" Here, Chairman Mao enthusiastically supported the beginning of the old drama revolution, pointing out the path of the old drama revolution and the path of the revolutionization of literature and art. Revolutionary dramatists and other revolutionary literary and artistic workers have been advancing on this bright path. However, the batch of counterrevolutionary revisionists supported by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party went in the opposite direction. Especially after the founding of the nation, they adopted more brazen counterrevolutionary two-faced tactics, resisting Chairman Mao's instructions, using the power and literary and artistic positions they controlled to create public opinion for the bourgeois counterrevolutionary restoration. They allowed the stage to be occupied by emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, and snakes, allowing many departments of literature and art to be ruled by the "dead," and turning some literary and artistic groups into organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary. The goal of these counterrevolutionary revisionists was to attempt, when the time was ripe, to overthrow proletarian dictatorship nationwide and achieve a great restoration of capitalism.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party declared the treacherous film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" to be a patriotic film in 1950 and, through the counterrevolutionary revisionists who controlled the cultural front, had it screened nationwide to poison the broad masses. They openly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions to criticize this film.

In 1954, Chairman Mao, in a letter to comrades of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and other relevant comrades, once again pointed out: "The film 'The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty,' which is called a patriotic film but is actually a traitorous film, has not been criticized since it was screened nationwide." The biggest capitalist-roader in the party, after being criticized by Chairman Mao, continued to obstruct the criticism of "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty." Why? Because he stubbornly wanted to implement capitalism in New China, and "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" perfectly suited his reactionary political needs.

In 1951, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great criticism of the film "The Life of Wu Xun." This was a major struggle against reactionary ideology, a major struggle against counterrevolutionary revisionists and their backer, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, on the literary and artistic front. In "We Must Pay Attention to the Discussion of the Film 'The Life of Wu Xun,'" Chairman Mao pointed out: "It is particularly worth noting that some who claim to have learned Marxism are communists. They have learned the history of social development—historical materialism, but when they encounter specific historical events, specific historical figures (such as Wu Xun), and specific anti-historical thoughts (such as the film 'The Life of Wu Xun' and other works about Wu Xun), they lose their ability to criticize. Some even surrender to this reactionary thought. Has the reactionary thought of the bourgeoisie not infiltrated the fighting Communist Party? Where has the Marxism that some communists claim to have learned gone?" This is an alarm for the entire party. This is a severe reprimand to those who have surrendered to bourgeois reactionary thought (including the biggest capitalist-roader in the party). However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and the small group of counterrevolutionary revisionists he supported on the literary and artistic front continued to adopt two-faced attitudes, superficially complying while actually resisting.

In 1954, it was again this group of "big shots" suppressing "little people," attempting to stifle the criticism of Yu Pingbo's "Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber.'" Chairman Mao personally supported the "little people" and led this great criticism. In "On the Question of Research on 'Dream of the Red Chamber,'" Chairman Mao again directly criticized the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The matter was initiated by two 'little people,' while the 'big shots' often do not pay attention and even obstruct. They form a united front with bourgeois writers on idealism and are willing to be captured by the bourgeoisie. This is almost the same as the situation when the films 'The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty' and 'The Life of Wu Xun' were screened.... 'The Life of Wu Xun' was criticized, but no lessons have been drawn from it. Now there is the strange phenomenon of tolerating Yu Pingbo's idealism and obstructing the vigorous critical articles of the 'little people.' This is worth our attention."

These gentlemen have still not drawn any lessons. Why? The facts revealed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement show that they are counterrevolutionary revisionists, and the big backer supporting these people is the biggest capitalist-roader in the party. Therefore, these people are so stubborn and unyielding, which is in accordance with the law.

After basic socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and the counterrevolutionary revisionists he supported in the former Propaganda Department, the former Ministry of Culture, and the former Beijing Municipal Committee launched more ferocious attacks on socialism and proletarian dictatorship. They eagerly prepared counterrevolutionary public opinion to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. From the anti-party, anti-socialist film "Drums of Film" in 1956 to the performance of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," to opposing the revolution of Peking opera, opposing the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," to opposing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement, they released a large amount of poisonous weeds and engaged in many nefarious activities. Some of these were directly supported or secretly directed by the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, and some were personally carried out by this biggest capitalist-roader. The film "Spark of Revolution," which defames the working class, is an example.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution mass movement initiated and led by Chairman Mao finally uncovered this historical secret, exposing a batch of counterrevolutionary revisionists on the cultural front and exposing the biggest capitalist-roader in the party, who was the mastermind behind these counterrevolutionary revisionists. This is a historical verdict. This is a historical summary of the struggle between the two lines within the party over the past seventeen years. This is the great victory of Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao leading hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to defeat the agents of the bourgeoisie within the party! This is the great victory of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie's restoration! This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Combining the history of class struggle on the literary and artistic front with the practice of this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we should further understand from studying Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents:

(1) As long as there are classes and class struggle within the country and internationally, the struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration will necessarily continue. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The current cultural revolution is only the first one, and there will necessarily be more in the future. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be resolved over a very long historical period. If things are not handled well, capitalist restoration may be possible at any time. All party members and the people of the entire country must not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will bring eternal peace. Be extremely vigilant and never relax." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, abandon unrealistic illusions, and prepare for long-term struggle.

(2) We must not only use guns to defend proletarian dictatorship but also use pens to defend proletarian dictatorship. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, pay high attention to class struggle on the literary and artistic front, firmly grasp the struggle between the two lines in the ideological realm, and elevate it to the level of the issue of state power. We must never treat it lightly. Neglecting this point is forgetting proletarian dictatorship.

(3) Where is the command center of the class enemies who attempt to overthrow proletarian dictatorship? It is hidden within a small group of people in the proletarian dictatorship apparatus and within a small group of people in the party's leadership organs. Fortresses are most easily breached from within, and the party's agents of the bourgeoisie are the most dangerous enemies. We must never be complacent. We should learn from the lessons of the Soviet Union's collapse. We must honestly follow Chairman Mao's instructions. To truly achieve this in practice, we must constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and constantly overcome various non-proletarian thoughts remaining in our minds. Only in this way can we become steadfast proletarian revolutionary fighters, always representing the proletariat and not the bourgeoisie.

(4) The biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the party, the counterrevolutionary revisionists, the revisionist goods they peddle, and their pretentious attitudes seem untouchable. The facts prove that they and their goods are all paper tigers. Mao Zedong Thought has been grasped by hundreds of millions of people, and they and their goods have collapsed. The victory of the Peking opera revolution proves this, and the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proves this even more. Hasn't the most stubborn fortress of Peking opera been breached? Haven't those arrogant capitalist-roaders who were untouchable been overthrown? In the future, it will be the same. Anyone who wants to be a capitalist-roader will meet the same fate of being overthrown by the revolutionary people.

We believe most in Mao Zedong Thought and in the broad masses. This is the full basis for our strategic contempt for all exploiting classes and their representatives and for all the ideological systems of the exploiting classes that have been passed down for thousands of years.

Only literature and art that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve the socialist economic base, along with other superstructures, have the strongest vitality and the broadest future. Those things that go against the tide of the times are doomed to be thoroughly buried by the revolutionary people, and the revolutionary people are burying them.

Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art have been proven by history to be great truths, and future practice will continue to prove this. The significance of these five documents is not limited to the literary and artistic realm. They are the sharpest weapons for our struggle against counterrevolutionary revisionism, for our struggle against the agents of the bourgeoisie within the party, and for our struggle against all the ideological systems of the exploiting classes. Let us study them seriously and apply them to the current class struggle to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and new victories in struggle, criticism, and transformation!

    伟大的真理，锐利的武器
    《红旗》杂志第九期社论
    第一次公开发表的毛主席关于文艺的五个文件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说。它是战胜资产阶级和其他剥削阶级意识形态，发展社会主义文学艺术，防止修正主义分子篡党篡政，巩固无产阶级专政的指南。它是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性的文献。
    毛主席在党的八届十中全会上，阐述社会主义社会的矛盾、阶级和阶级斗争的理论时指出：利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。
    这个极其深刻的论点，向我们指出：社会主义社会里的阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政同资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政的斗争，而资产阶级推翻无产阶级专政的罪恶活动，总要先造舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作，并且总要着重利用文艺这个武器。
    建国十七年来，文艺战线上的一场接着一场的惊心动魄的阶级斗争，就是围绕着政权这个轴心进行的。为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竭力支持的思想文化战线上的一批反革命修正主义分子，例如陆定一、周扬、齐燕铭、夏衍、林默涵，旧北京市委反革命修正主义的头头彭真，他们在戏剧、电影、小说和文艺理论方面进行的活动，都是为推翻无产阶级专政制造舆论。在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，无产阶级的革命战士在文艺战线上所进行的斗争，则是为着铲除反革命修正主义的舆论，巩固无产阶级专政。
    早在一九四四年，毛主席在《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》中就指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。你们这个开端将是旧剧革命的划时期的开端，我想到这一点就十分高兴，希望你们多编多演，蔚成风气，推向全国去！”在这里，毛主席热情地支持旧剧革命的开端，指出了旧剧革命的道路，指出了文艺革命化的道路。革命的戏剧工作者和其他的革命文艺工作者，就是在这条光明大路上前进的。可是，那批为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持的反革命修正主义分子，却反其道而行之。尤其是建国以后，他们更变本加厉地采取反革命的两面手法，对抗毛主席的指示，利用他们手里掌握的权力和把持的文学艺术阵地，制造资产阶级反革命复辟的舆论。他们使戏剧舞台，让帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神盘踞着，使文艺的许多部门被“死人”统治着，使若干文艺团体变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。那些反革命修正主义分子的目的，就是妄图时机一到，在全国范围内推翻无产阶级专政，实现资本主义的大复辟。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在一九五○年就把卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》说成爱国主义影片，通过把持文化阵地的反革命修正主义分子，使之在全国放映，毒害广大群众。他们公然抗拒毛主席关于批判这部影片的指示。
    一九五四年，毛主席在写给中共中央政治局的同志和其他有关同志的一封信中，再一次指出：“被人称为爱国主义影片而实际是卖国主义影片的《清宫秘史》，在全国放映之后，至今没有被批判。”党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，受到毛主席的批判之后，仍然阻挠对《清宫秘史》的批判。这是为什么呢？就是因为他顽固地要在新中国实行资本主义，而《清宫秘史》正好适合他这个反动政治的需要。
    一九五一年，毛主席亲自发动和领导了对电影《武训传》的大批判。这是对反动的意识形态的一场大斗争，是对文艺战线上反革命修正主义分子及其后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的一场大斗争。毛主席在《应当重视电影〈武训传〉的讨论》中指出：“特别值得注意的，是一些号称学得了马克思主义的共产党员。他们学得了社会发展史——历史唯物论，但是一遇到具体的历史事件，具体的历史人物（如象武训），具体的反历史的思想（如象电影《武训传》及其他关于武训的著作），就丧失了批判的能力，有些人则竟至向这种反动思想投降。资产阶级的反动思想侵入了战斗的共产党，这难道不是事实吗？一些共产党员自称已经学得的马克思主义，究竟跑到什么地方去了呢？”这是对全党敲起的警钟。这是对那些向资产阶级反动思想投降的人们（其中包括党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派）的严厉斥责。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，以及他支持的文艺战线上的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，仍然采取两面态度，表面应付，实则对抗。
    一九五四年，又是这一批“大人物”压制“小人物”，妄图扼杀对俞平伯《红楼梦研究》的批判。毛主席亲自支持“小人物”，领导了这场大批判，并且在《关于红楼梦研究问题的信》中，又直接批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。毛主席指出：“事情是两个‘小人物’做起来的，而‘大人物’往往不注意，并往往加以阻拦，他们同资产阶级作家在唯心论方面讲统一战线，甘心作资产阶级的俘虏，这同影片《清宫秘史》和《武训传》放映时候的情形几乎是相同的。……《武训传》虽然批判了，却至今没有引出教训，又出现了容忍俞平伯唯心论和阻拦‘小人物’的很有生气的批判文章的奇怪事情，这是值得我们注意的。”
    这班老爷们，至今仍然没有引出教训。为什么呢？在无产阶级文化大革命群众运动中，揭露出来的大量事实证明，原来他们是反革命修正主义分子，原来支持这些人的大后台，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。因此，这班人，这样的顽固不化，是合乎规律的。
    在我国基本上完成了生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造以后，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，以及他支持的旧中宣部、旧文化部和旧北京市委的反革命修正主义分子，向社会主义的进攻，向无产阶级专政的进攻更加疯狂了。他们竭力做推翻无产阶级专政的反革命的舆论准备。从一九五六年反党反社会主义的《电影的锣鼓》出笼，到《海瑞罢官》的上演，到反对京剧革命，反对批判《海瑞罢官》，到反对无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，他们抛出了大量的毒草，进行了许多不可告人的勾当。这一些，有的是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派直接支持或者暗中指使的，有的是这个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，亲自出马干的，丑化工人阶级的电影《燎原》，就是一个例子。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，终于揭开了这个历史的秘密，把文化战线上的一批反革命修正主义分子揭露出来了，把这批反革命修正主义分子的总后台、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来了。这是历史的鉴定。这是十七年来党内两条道路斗争的一个历史总结。这是毛主席及其亲密战友林彪同志率领亿万革命群众，战胜党内资产阶级代理人的伟大胜利！这是无产阶级反对资产阶级复辟的伟大胜利！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    结合文艺战线上的阶级斗争的历史，结合这场无产阶级文化大革命的实践，学习毛主席的五个光辉文件，我们应该进一步认识到：
    （一）只要国内和国际上还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争就必然继续存在。毛主席教导我们：“现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。”我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，丢掉不切实际的幻想，准备长期斗争。
    （二）我们不但要用枪杆子保卫无产阶级专政，而且还必须用笔杆子保卫无产阶级专政。我们必须遵照毛主席的历次指示，高度重视文学艺术战线上的阶级斗争，狠抓意识形态领域里两条道路的斗争，并且提高到政权问题上来认识，切切不可等闲视之。忽视这一点，就是忘记了无产阶级专政。
    （三）妄图推翻无产阶级专政的阶级敌人的司令部在那里呢？就是隐蔽在无产阶级专政机构内部的某一小撮人，隐蔽在党的领导机关内部的某一小撮人。堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的，党内的资产阶级代理人是最危险的敌人。我们决不能麻痹。苏联的覆车之辙，应当引为鉴戒。我们自己要老老实实地照毛主席的指示办事。要在实际中真正做到这一点，就必须不断地用毛泽东思想武装自己，不断地克服自己头脑中残存的各种非无产阶级思想。只有这样，才能做一个坚定的无产阶级革命战士，永远代表无产阶级说话，而不是代表资产阶级说话。
    （四）党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，反革命修正主义分子，他们贩卖的修正主义的东西，装腔作势，看来象是动不得的。事实证明，他们和他们那套货色统统是纸老虎。毛泽东思想掌握了亿万群众，他们和他们那套货色就垮台了。京剧革命的胜利证明了这一点，无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，更加证明了这一点。京剧这个最顽固的堡垒不是被攻破了吗！那些不可一世的走资本主义道路的什么“大人物”，不是被打倒了吗！今后也是一样，谁要做走资本主义道路的当权派，他的命运也只能是被革命人民打倒。
    我们最相信毛泽东思想，最相信广大群众，这就是我们在战略上藐视一切剥削阶级及其代表人物，藐视几千年传下来的一切剥削阶级意识形态的充分根据。
    只有为工农兵服务、为社会主义经济基础服务的文学艺术和其他上层建筑，才有最强大的生命力，才有最广阔的前途。那些逆乎时代潮流的腐朽的东西，只能被革命人民彻底埋葬，而革命人民也正在埋葬它。
    毛主席关于文艺的五个文件，历史证明了，都是伟大的真理，今后的实践，将继续证明。这五个文件的意义，绝不限于文艺领域，它是我们向反革命修正主义作斗争的最锐利的武器，向党内的资产阶级代理人作斗争的最锐利的武器，向一切剥削阶级的意识形态作斗争的最锐利的武器。让我们认真学习，把它运用到当前阶级斗争中去，争取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，争取斗、批、改的新胜利！
