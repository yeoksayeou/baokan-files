I would like to congratulate everyone on this performance. Everyone has worked very hard, and this is the first battle in the revolution of Peking Opera, achieving a gratifying outcome with a relatively far-reaching impact.

The modern revolutionary plays in Peking Opera have been performed, but does everyone have the same understanding? I don't think so.

We must have firm confidence in performing revolutionary modern plays in Peking Opera. It is unimaginable that on the stage of our socialist motherland, led by the Communist Party, the main figures are not the workers, peasants, and soldiers—the true creators of history and the real masters of the state. We must create and protect art that serves our socialist economic foundation. When the direction is unclear, we must clarify it. I would like to provide two figures for everyone's reference. These two figures are shocking to me.

The first figure is: According to an imprecise statistic, there are 3,000 troupes nationwide (excluding amateur troupes, not to mention black troupes). Among them, about 90 are professional drama troupes, and more than 80 are cultural work troupes. The remaining 2,800-plus are opera troupes. On the opera stage, there are emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, as well as ghosts and demons. Those 90-odd drama troupes are not necessarily all about workers, peasants, and soldiers; they are also about "one big, two foreign, three ancient." It can be said that the drama stage is also occupied by ancient Chinese and foreigners. The theater, which is supposed to be a place for educating the people, now has emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on stage, which is a set of feudalism and a set of bourgeoisie. This situation cannot protect our economic foundation but will have a destructive effect on it.

The second figure is: Our country has 600 million workers, peasants, and soldiers, and a small group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and bourgeois elements. Are we serving this small group or the 600 million? This question is not only for Communist Party members to consider but also for all patriotic artists. Eating the grain grown by farmers, wearing clothes woven by workers, living in houses built by workers, and having the People's Liberation Army guarding our national defense frontiers, but not portraying them, I ask, on which class stand do the artists stand? Where is the "conscience" you often talk about?

The performance of revolutionary modern plays in Peking Opera will have ups and downs, but if we think carefully about the two figures I mentioned earlier, it may not have ups and downs, or at least fewer ups and downs. Even if there are ups and downs, it doesn't matter. History always progresses in a winding manner, but the wheels of history cannot be turned back. We advocate revolutionary modern plays to reflect the reality of the past 15 years since the founding of the nation and to create images of revolutionary heroes of the contemporary era on our opera stage. This is the primary task. We are not against historical plays. In this observation and performance, revolutionary historical plays also occupy a significant proportion. Plays depicting the lives and struggles of the people before the founding of our party are also needed, and we must establish models and create truly historical materialist historical plays that can be used for the present. Of course, this must be done without hindering the primary task (reflecting modern life and creating images of workers, peasants, and soldiers). Traditional plays are not all to be discarded, except for ghost plays and plays that sing the praises of traitors and defectors. Good traditional plays can all be performed. However, if these traditional plays are not seriously revised and edited, no one will watch them. I have systematically attended the theater for more than two years, observing the actors and audience, and can conclude that if traditional plays are not seriously revised and edited, no one will watch them. In the future, the revision and editing of traditional plays are still necessary, but all these cannot replace the first task.

Next, let's talk about where to start.

I think the key is the script. Without a script, even with directors and actors, nothing can be directed or performed. Some people say, "Script, script, the foundation of a play." This is very true. Therefore, we must focus on creation.

In recent years, drama creation has fallen far behind reality, and Peking Opera creation is even worse. There are few playwrights, and they lack life experience, so of course, they cannot create good scripts. The key to focusing on creation is to combine leadership, professionals, and the masses. I have recently studied the creation experience of "South Sea Great Wall," and they did it this way: first, the leadership proposed a topic, the playwright went to live among the people three times, and even participated in a military operation to annihilate enemy spies. After the script was written, many responsible comrades from the Guangzhou troops personally participated in the script discussion. After rehearsals, they widely solicited opinions and revised it. In this way, by continuously soliciting opinions and revising, they were able to create such a timely play that reflects the real struggle in a relatively short time.

Shanghai Municipal Committee focuses on creation, and Comrade Ke Qingshi personally takes charge. Each region should dispatch strong cadres to focus on creation.

In a short period, it is still difficult for Peking Opera to directly create scripts, but now we must select people to receive specialized training and then send them to live among the people. We can start by writing small plays and gradually create big plays. Small plays are also good if done well.

In creation, we must cultivate new forces, send them to live among the people, and they will bear fruit in three to five years.

On the other hand, there is transplantation, which is also good.

Transplantation must be carefully selected. First, look at the political orientation, and second, see if it is suitable for the conditions of the troupe. When transplanting, we must carefully analyze the original work, affirm the strengths, and do not change them; for the weaknesses, we must make up for them. When editing Peking Opera, we must pay attention to two aspects: on the one hand, it must conform to the characteristics of Peking Opera, with singing and martial arts, the lyrics must conform to the rhythm of Peking Opera singing, and Peking Opera language must be used. Otherwise, the actors will not be able to sing. On the other hand, we must not overly indulge the actors; the script must have a clear theme, a rigorous structure, and prominent characters, and we must not create a play that is scattered just to give each of the main actors a scene.

Peking Opera art is exaggerated, and it has always been about portraying old times and old characters, so it is easier to portray negative characters, and some people appreciate this. However, it is very difficult to establish positive characters, but we must still establish advanced revolutionary heroes. Shanghai's "Strategic Campaign at Mount Hua," originally had very arrogant negative characters and dry positive characters. The leadership personally took charge, and this play was definitely improved. Now, the scene of Ding Hedao has been cut, and the scene of Zuo Ertai has been basically unchanged (the actor playing Zuo Ertai is very good at acting), but because Yang Zhenrong and Shao Jianbo have been highlighted, the negative characters have become less prominent. I heard that there are different opinions about this play, and this problem can be debated. We must consider which side we are on: are we on the side of the positive characters or the negative characters? I heard that some people oppose writing positive characters, which is wrong. Good people are always the majority, not only in our socialist country but also in imperialist countries, the majority are still working people. In revisionist countries, revisionists are also a minority. We must focus on creating the artistic image of advanced revolutionaries to educate and inspire everyone and lead everyone forward. We perform revolutionary modern plays mainly to sing the praises of positive characters. The Inner Mongolia Art Theater Peking Opera Troupe's "Little Heroine of the Grasslands" is very good. The playwright's revolutionary feelings were stirred by the advanced deeds of these two little heroes, creating such a play. The middle part is still very moving. It's just that the playwright lacks life experience, did it in a hurry, and didn't have time to carve it finely, so the beginning and end are not very good. Now it seems like a good painting in a crude old frame. This play is also worth noting because it wrote Peking Opera for our children and teenagers. In short, this play has a foundation and is good. I hope the playwright will delve deeper into life and revise it well. I think we should cherish our labor and not easily discard what we have created. Some comrades are not willing to revise what they have created, making it difficult to achieve greater success. In this regard, Shanghai is a good example. They are willing to revise again and again, so they created "Strategic Campaign at Mount Hua" as it is today. The plays in this observation and performance should all be further revised when they return. Once established, do not easily overthrow it.

Finally, I hope that everyone can spare some energy to learn from each other's performances. In this way, the harvest of this conference can be shown to the vast audience across the country.

    谈京剧革命
    一九六四年七月在京剧现代戏观摩演出人员的座谈会上的讲话
    江青
    我对这次演出表示祝贺。大家付出了很大的劳动，这是京剧革命的第一个战役，已经取得了可喜的收获，影响也将是比较深远的。
    京剧革命现代戏是演起来了，可是，大家的认识是否都一样了呢？我看还不能这样说。
    对京剧演革命的现代戏这件事的信心要坚定。在共产党领导的社会主义祖国舞台上占主要地位的不是工农兵，不是这些历史真正的创造者，不是这些国家真正的主人翁，那是不能设想的事。我们要创造保护自己社会主义经济基础的文艺。在方向不清楚的时候，要好好辨清方向。我在这里提两个数字供大家参考。这两个数字对我来说是惊心动魄的。
    第一个数字是：全国的剧团，根据不精确的统计，是三千个（不包括业余剧团，更不算黑剧团），其中有九十个左右是职业话剧团，八十多个是文工团，其余两千八百多个是戏曲剧团。在戏曲舞台上，都是帝王将相、才子佳人，还有牛鬼蛇神。那九十几个话剧团，也不一定都是表现工农兵的，也是“一大、二洋、三古”，可以说话剧舞台也被中外古人占据了。剧场本是教育人民的场所，如今舞台上都是帝王将相、才子佳人，是封建主义的一套，是资产阶级的一套。这种情况，不能保护我们的经济基础，而会对我们的经济基础起破坏作用。
    第二个数字是：我们全国工农兵有六亿几千万，另外一小撮人是地、富、反、坏、右和资产阶级分子。是为这一小撮人服务，还是为六亿几千万人服务呢？这问题不仅是共产党员要考虑，而且凡有爱国主义思想的文艺工作者都要考虑。吃着农民种的粮食，穿着工人织造的衣服，住着工人盖的房子，人民解放军为我们警卫着国防前线，但是却不去表现他们，试问，艺术家站在什么阶级立场，你们常说的艺术家的“良心”何在？
    京剧演革命的现代戏这件事还会有反复，但要好好想想我在上面说的两个数字，就有可能不反复，或者少反复。即使反复也不要紧，历史总是曲曲折折前进的，但是，历史的车轮绝不能拉回来。我们提倡革命的现代戏，要反映建国十五年来的现实生活，要在我们的戏曲舞台上塑造出当代的革命英雄形象来。这是首要的任务。我们也不是不要历史剧，在这次观摩演出中，革命历史剧占的比重就不小。描写我们党成立以前人民的生活和斗争的历史剧也还是要的，而且也要树立标兵，要搞出真正用历史唯物主义观点写的、能够古为今用的历史剧来。当然，要在不妨碍主要任务（表现现代生活、塑造工农兵形象）的前提下来搞历史剧。传统戏也不是都不要，除了鬼戏和歌颂投降变节的戏以外，好的传统戏都尽可上演。但是，这些传统戏如果不认真整理加工，是没有什么人看的。我曾系统地下剧场两年多，观察了演员、观众，可以得出结论，传统戏如果不认真进行加工，是不会有人看的。今后传统戏的整理、加工工作还是要的，但是，所有这些都不能代替第一个任务。
    其次，说说从何着手的问题。
    我认为，关键是剧本。没有剧本，光有导演、演员，是导不出什么，也演不出什么来的。有人说：“剧本，剧本，一剧之本。”这话是很对的。所以，一定要抓创作。
    这些年，戏剧创作远远落后于现实，京剧的创作更谈不到。编剧的人少，又缺乏生活，当然创作不出好剧本来。抓创作的关键是把领导、专业人员、群众三者结合起来。我最近研究了《南海长城》的创作经验，他们就是这样搞的，先由领导出个题目，剧作者三下生活，并且亲身参与了一次歼灭敌人特务的军事行动。剧本写好之后，广州部队的许多负责同志都亲自参加了剧本的讨论。排演以后，广泛征求意见，再改。这样，不断征求意见，不断修改，所以能在较短时间内搞出这样及时反映现实斗争的好戏来。
    上海市委抓创作，柯庆施同志亲自抓。各地都要派强的干部抓创作。
    短时间内，京剧要想直接创作出剧本来还很难，不过，现在就要抽出人来，先受些专门训练，然后放下去生活，可以先写小戏，再逐渐搞出大戏来。小戏搞得好也很好。
    在创作上，要培养新生力量，放下去，三年五年就会开花结果。
    另一方面是移植，这也好。
    移植要慎重选择，第一看政治倾向好不好，第二要看与本剧团条件是否合适。移植时，要好好分析原作，对人家的长处要肯定下来，不能改变；对人家的弱点，要加以弥补。改编的京剧，要注意两方面的问题：一方面要合乎京剧的特点，有歌唱，有武打，唱词要合乎京剧歌唱的韵律，要用京剧的语言。否则，演员就无法唱。另一方面，对演员也不要过分迁就，剧本还是要主题明确，结构严谨，人物突出，不要为了几个主要演员每人来一段戏而把整个戏搞得稀稀拉拉的。
    京剧艺术是夸张的，同时，一向又是表现旧时代旧人物的，因此，表现反面人物比较容易，也有人对此很欣赏。要树立正面人物却是很不容易，但是，我们还是一定要树立起先进的革命英雄人物来。上海的《智取威虎山》，原来剧中的反面人物很嚣张，正面人物则干瘪瘪。领导上亲自抓，这个戏肯定是改好了。现在把定河道人的戏砍掉了一场，座山雕的戏则基本没有动（演座山雕的演员是很会做戏的），但是，由于把杨子荣和少剑波突出起来了，反面人物相形失色了。听说对这个戏有不同看法，这个问题可以争论一番。要考虑是坐在哪一边？是坐在正面人物一边，还是坐在反面人物一边？听说还有人反对写正面人物，这是不对的。好人总是大多数，不仅在我们社会主义国家是如此，即使在帝国主义国家里，大多数的还是劳动人民。在修正主义国家里，修正主义者也还是少数。我们要着重塑造先进革命者的艺术形象，给大家以教育鼓舞，带动大家前进。我们搞革命现代戏，主要是歌颂正面人物。内蒙古艺术剧院京剧团的《草原英雄小姊妹》很好，剧作者的革命感情被这两个小英雄的先进事迹激动起来，写成这样一个戏，那中间的一段还是很动人的。只是由于作者还缺乏生活，搞得又很急，还没有来得及精雕细刻，一头一尾搞得不大好，现在看来，好象是一幅好画嵌在粗劣的旧镜框里。这个戏，还有一点值得重视，那就是为我们的少年儿童写了京戏。总之，这个戏是有基础的，是好的。希望剧作家再深入生活，好好加以修改。我觉得，我们应该重视自己的劳动，搞出来的东西不要轻易丢掉。有的同志对于搞出来的成品不愿意再改，这就很难取得较大的成就。在这方面，上海是好的典型，他们愿意一改再改，所以把《智取威虎山》搞成今天这个样子。这次观摩演出的剧目，回去都应该继续加工。立起来了的，不要轻易把它打倒。
    最后，我希望这次大家能抽出些精力来互相学学戏，这样，可以使这次大会的收获在全国的舞台上与各地广大的观众见面。
