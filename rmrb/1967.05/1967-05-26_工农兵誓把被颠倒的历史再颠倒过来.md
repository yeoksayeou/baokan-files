Order the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies to all get out of the way!
Workers, peasants, and soldiers swear to reverse the inverted history once again.

The nationwide billion military and civilian people enthusiastically acclaim the public release of Chairman Mao's letter "After Watching 'Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain' Written to the Yan'an Pingju Theater," and declare that they will definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, and produce and perform many revolutionary modern plays to make them prevalent.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 25th, the public release of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's great instructions on the revolution of Peking Opera—"After Watching 'Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain' Written to the Yan'an Pingju Theater"—has made the nationwide celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" even more joyous. The proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary literary and artistic workers, revolutionary masses, and the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country studied Chairman Mao's letter written 23 years ago today, and their feelings were particularly stirred. They unanimously pointed out: Chairman Mao's letter is a declaration calling on us to launch a general offensive against old culture, and a bugle call for a brave march against the old world. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary literary and artistic workers across the country expressed that they will definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, seize the stage that counter-revolutionary revisionists control to propagate capitalism, feudalism, and revisionism, and reverse the inverted history once again. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers will not only become the masters on the political and economic stages but will also definitely become the masters on the literary and artistic stage!

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary literary and artistic workers in the capital enthusiastically acclaim the public release of Chairman Mao's letter "After Watching 'Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain' Written to the Yan'an Pingju Theater." The revolutionary amateur literary and artistic warriors of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Red Guards of the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory said with great emotion: The public release of this letter by the great leader Chairman Mao is another great joy for the revolutionary people of the entire nation. We workers, peasants, and soldiers and all revolutionary literary and artistic workers will definitely hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought and drive the emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, masters, mistresses, young masters, young ladies, and all the ghosts and monsters off the stage, not leaving a single one behind! We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of a socialist country and are naturally the masters of the socialist literary and artistic stage. We will definitely occupy this position in the literary and artistic world. The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of professional literary and artistic troupes such as the China Peking Opera Troupe, the Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Ballet Troupe, and the Central Orchestra studied Chairman Mao's letter and were extremely moved. They expressed that they will definitely respond to the great leader's call, produce and perform many revolutionary modern plays, making them prevalent, and let the new socialist culture shine brilliantly, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought spread throughout China and the world.

The broad proletarian revolutionary factions, workers, peasants, and revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Shanghai unanimously said: Chairman Mao's letter really speaks to the hearts of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. An old worker of the Shanghai Port Bureau, Wu Fengjian, who has been a dock worker for over 30 years, said: After liberation, we workers stood up and became masters; but on the stage controlled by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic world, we laboring people still have not stood up and have been vilified beyond recognition. He said, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and with the care and guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, the revolutionary Peking Opera model play "The Harbor" has allowed revolutionary dock workers to take the stage of Peking Opera and created a heroic image of dock workers. I watched this play and was truly indescribably happy. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. Worker writer Hu Wanqing excitedly pointed out: Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao, we broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have risen up to rebel against those counter-revolutionary revisionists, and the great era of reversing the inverted history has begun.

Famous national labor model and brigade leader of Xigou Production Brigade in Pingxian County, Li Shunda, said excitedly: Chairman Mao's letter speaks the words in the hearts of the laboring people. We poor and lower-middle peasants support it a thousand times and cheer a million times! We workers, peasants, and soldiers will definitely take up the iron broom of Mao Zedong Thought and sweep away those masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies who have long been overthrown by us and drink human blood and eat human flesh, and sweep away those corpses of the exploiting classes, emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties from the stage, and let the heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers shine brilliantly on the stage.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Shandong Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, who created and performed the revolutionary model play "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment," said excitedly after rereading Chairman Mao's letter: The birth of the excellent model play "Raiding the White Tiger Regiment" is the result of earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions under the direct leadership and personal care of Comrade Jiang Qing. They said: The public release of Chairman Mao's letter has given us boundless strength. In the future, we will definitely study it earnestly, deeply understand it, and implement it conscientiously.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the mountain city of Guiyang, as well as revolutionary literary and artistic workers from the province and city, held celebration meetings, discussion meetings, and commemorative performances to enthusiastically acclaim the public release of Chairman Mao's letter "After Watching 'Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain' Written to the Yan'an Pingju Theater." The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Guiyang City Pingju Troupe said with great emotion: Chairman Mao's letter after watching "Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain" written to the Yan'an Pingju Theater is our compass and guiding light. We will definitely resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, and on the stage, we will firmly establish and specially establish Mao Zedong Thought, and specially perform the heroes of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and let workers, peasants, and soldiers occupy all literary and artistic positions.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Heilongjiang Province all studied Chairman Mao's letter today and pointed out that this letter is another battle program for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The public release of Chairman Mao's letter "After Watching 'Forced onto the Liangshan Mountain' Written to the Yan'an Pingju Theater" has given new great encouragement and strength to the broad ranks of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces and the literary and artistic workers of the troops. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain naval unit active on the first line of supporting the left, after listening to the broadcast of Chairman Mao's letter, was stirred with surging emotions and immediately compiled and performed programs such as "Order the masters and mistresses to get out of the way, I'm coming!" for the masses. The revolutionary literary and artistic workers of the Guangzhou Military Region's Revolutionary Army Theater Troupe, who successfully staged the play "South China Great Wall" under the personal guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, said: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a small number of counter-revolutionary revisionists do not allow workers, peasants, and soldiers to take the stage, aiming to use literature and art as a tool for their capitalist restoration. The proletariat must reverse the inverted history and restore the true face of history, allowing workers, peasants, and soldiers to occupy the stage, and must thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line and its ultimate backer.
