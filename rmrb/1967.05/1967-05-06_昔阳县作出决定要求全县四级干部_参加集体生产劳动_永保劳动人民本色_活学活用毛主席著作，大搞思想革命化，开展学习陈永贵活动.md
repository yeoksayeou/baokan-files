The Communist Party of China Xiyang County Core Group and Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee have issued the "Decision on Four-Level Cadres Participating in Collective Production Labor," which is of great significance for consolidating and developing the victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords who ride on the heads of the people. Through participating in collective production labor, cadres can maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism."

In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were overlords who rode on the heads of the people. They resisted and sabotaged the system of cadres participating in collective production labor, causing cadres to become detached from and opposed to the masses. Their goal was to achieve a capitalist restoration in China. Our revolutionary cadres are able to represent the masses precisely because they "serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses." When we seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and overthrow them, we must throw their bad habits of being officials and overlords into the garbage heap. We must never leave the masses or labor, and always maintain the character of the laboring people. Otherwise, our cadres will lose their qualification to represent the masses and gradually change color. The proletarian revolutionary faction, which has already seized and held power, must treat this issue as a top priority, give it great attention, and make every member of the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ a model for participating in collective production labor, always maintaining good contact with the masses.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 4th, the Communist Party of China Xiyang County Core Group and Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee recently issued the "Decision on Four-Level Cadres Participating in Collective Production Labor," which has been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary cadres and masses.

After the establishment of the communes, the four-level cadres of Xiyang County, including county, commune, brigade, and production team levels, have generally participated in collective production labor. In the spring of 1963, they were commended by the Party Central Committee. The broad revolutionary cadres of this county have deeply realized through practice that cadres participating in collective production labor is fundamental to maintaining the proletarian revolutionary character, preventing bureaucracy, and preventing revisionism; it is fundamental to maintaining contact with the masses and closely linking cadres with the masses; it is fundamental to better grasping the actual situation and guiding production. However, in recent years, due to the seizure of the county's leadership power by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they not only failed to seriously implement Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions on cadres participating in collective production labor, but also resisted and sabotaged cadres participating in labor while opposing the three red banners.

In mid-February of this year, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Xiyang County seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the county committee and achieved the "three-in-one combination" revolution. Recently, the Communist Party of China Xiyang County Core Group and Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee organized cadres to review Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's important instructions on cadres participating in collective production labor, summarized the experiences and lessons of organizing cadres to participate in collective production labor in the past few years, and issued the "Decision on Four-Level Cadres Participating in Collective Production Labor." The decision emphasizes that to make the participation of four-level cadres in collective production labor regular and institutionalized, cadres must be constantly armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The decision puts forward six aspects of requirements:

First, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, carry out a thorough revolution in ideology, and combine participating in collective production labor with transforming ideology.

Second, carry out the revolutionization of organs, improve the leadership style, and combine organizing cadres to participate in collective production labor with the revolutionization of organs. Leading organs should vigorously streamline organizations, allocate more strength to the grassroots, and resolutely overcome the "five excesses" (too many reports, meetings, documents, calls, and instructions) phenomenon, so that commune and brigade cadres can spend more time on the front line.

Third, carry out the movement to learn from Chen Yonggui among cadres, and combine participating in labor with learning from Chen Yonggui. Cadres should be like Chen Yonggui, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget labor, always maintain the character of the laboring people, work hard for the construction of socialism, closely contact the masses in labor, constantly discover and solve problems, and improve the ability to guide production.

Fourth, county and commune cadres should go to the teams for fieldwork, practice personally, and combine participating in labor with investigation and research. When county and commune cadres go to the teams for fieldwork, they should seriously implement the "six together" (study together, use together, discuss together, eat together, live together, and labor together) with the masses, strengthen investigation and research, conduct scientific experiments, help grassroots cadres discover and solve production problems in a timely manner, help the masses solve practical difficulties in life, and promote the development of various rural work.

Fifth, focus on leading by example, and combine organizing cadres to participate in labor with learning from Dazhai. Cadres at all levels should cultivate models and set examples in the units where they go for fieldwork. A mass movement of "following the Dazhai path, learning from Dazhai people, promoting the Dazhai spirit, nurturing the Dazhai will, building Dazhai fields, and catching up with Dazhai production" should be launched.

Sixth, leading cadres at all levels should put the participation of four-level cadres in collective production labor on the important agenda, study it regularly, arrange it regularly, inspect it regularly, evaluate it regularly, and solve existing problems at any time, so that the system of cadres participating in labor is more solidly implemented, consolidated, and developed, and new and greater achievements are made.

Currently, this decision is being conveyed and implemented throughout the county. The cadres and masses of the whole county warmly welcome and support this decision. They say: The participation of four-level cadres in collective production labor is our glorious tradition in Xiyang. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, driven by their evil intention of restoring capitalism, have done everything possible to sabotage this tradition. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they quickly restored and carried forward this tradition. This decision is great. They enthusiastically cheer: This is a new victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! This is a new victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought!

    昔阳县作出决定要求全县四级干部
    参加集体生产劳动　永保劳动人民本色
    活学活用毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化，开展学习陈永贵活动
    编者按：中共山西省昔阳县核心小组和昔阳县革命委员会发出《关于四级干部参加集体生产劳动的决定》，对于巩固和发展无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果，具有极其重大的意义。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”
    过去党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是骑在人民头上的官老爷，他们百般抵制和破坏干部参加集体生产劳动的制度，使干部和群众脱离开来，对立起来，其目的就是要在中国实现资本主义复辟。我们的革命干部之所以能够成为群众的代表，正因为他们“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。当我们夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，并把他们打翻在地的时候，一定要连他们那一套做官当老爷的恶劣作风统统丢进垃圾堆里去。一定要永远不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，保持劳动人民的本色。否则，我们的干部就丧失了代表群众的资格，就会渐渐改变颜色。已经夺权和掌权的无产阶级革命派，一定要把这个问题作为一件头等大事，予以极大的重视，使每一个参加“三结合”临时权力机构的成员，都成为参加集体生产劳动的模范，永远保持联系群众的良好作风。
    据新华社太原四日电中共山西省昔阳县核心小组和昔阳县革命委员会，最近发出《关于四级干部参加集体生产劳动的决定》，受到广大革命干部和社员群众的热烈拥护。
    昔阳县的县、社、大队、生产队四级干部在公社化以后普遍地参加集体生产劳动，曾经在一九六三年春受到党中央的通报表扬。这个县的广大革命干部从实践中深刻地认识到：干部参加集体生产劳动，是保持无产阶级革命本色，免除官僚主义和防止产生修正主义的根本；是联系群众，密切干部和群众关系的根本；是更好地掌握实际，指导生产的根本。但是，近几年来由于全县领导大权被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺，他们不但不认真贯彻执行毛主席和党中央关于干部参加集体生产劳动的指示，相反地却在大反三面红旗的同时百般抵制和破坏干部参加劳动。
    今年二月中旬，昔阳县无产阶级革命派夺了县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，实现了革命的“三结合”。最近，中共昔阳县核心小组和昔阳县革命委员会，组织干部重温毛主席和党中央关于干部参加集体生产劳动的重要指示，总结了前几年组织干部参加集体生产劳动的经验和教训，并且作出了《关于四级干部参加集体生产劳动的决定》。这个决定强调指出：为使四级干部参加集体生产劳动经常化、制度化，必须不断地用毛泽东思想武装干部。决定提出了六个方面的要求：
    第一，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，大搞思想革命化，把参加集体生产劳动和改造思想结合起来。
    第二，搞好机关革命化，改进领导作风，实行组织干部参加集体生产劳动和机关革命化相结合。领导机关要大力精简机构，抽出更多的力量，加强基层，并坚决克服“五多”（表报多、会议多、文件多、号召多、指示多）现象，使社、队干部能抽出更多时间深入第一线。
    第三，在干部中开展学习陈永贵运动，把参加劳动和学习陈永贵结合起来。要象陈永贵那样，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，时时不忘劳动，永远保持劳动人民的本色，一心一意为建设社会主义实干苦干，在劳动中密切联系群众，不断发现和解决问题，提高指导生产的能力。
    第四，县、社干部要下队蹲点，亲自实践，做到参加劳动和调查研究相结合。县、社干部蹲点时，要认真地同群众实行六同（同学、同用、同商量、同吃、同住、同劳动），加强调查研究，进行科学实验，帮助基层干部及时发现和解决生产中的问题，帮助群众解决生活上的实际困难，推动农村各项工作向前发展。
    第五，大抓以点带面，把组织干部参加劳动和学习大寨结合起来。各级干部要在自己蹲点劳动的单位，培养典型，树立榜样。要掀起一个“走大寨路，学大寨人，兴大寨风，长大寨志，建大寨田，赶大寨产”的群众运动。
    第六，各级领导干部要把四级干部参加集体生产劳动放到重要的议事日程上来，定期研究，定期布置，定期检查，定期评比，随时解决存在的问题，使干部参加劳动的制度更加落实，更加巩固和发展，做出新的更大的成绩。
    目前，这个决定正在全县传达和贯彻。全县干部和社员热烈欢迎和拥护这个决定。他们说：四级干部参加集体生产劳动，是我们昔阳的光荣传统。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的出发，千方百计地破坏这个传统。无产阶级革命派掌权之后，很快恢复和发扬这个传统，这个决定太好了。他们热烈欢呼：这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利！这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的新胜利！
