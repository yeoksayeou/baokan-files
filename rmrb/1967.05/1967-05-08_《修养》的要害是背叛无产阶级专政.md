Title: The Essence of "Cultivation" is Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

Edition: 1

All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating it. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power.

	Mao Zedong

The book "Cultivation" is the representative work of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. This book is a poisonous weed that is anti-Marxism-Leninism and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. It has spread its poison throughout the country and the world. It must be thoroughly criticized.

What is the essence of the book "Cultivation"?

The essence of this book is the betrayal of the Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. To betray the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is to completely and thoroughly betray Marxism-Leninism, and to completely and thoroughly betray the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.

More than a hundred years ago, Marx pointed out:

	"As for myself, I must say that I have neither discovered the existence of classes in modern society nor the struggle between them. Long before me, bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle, and bourgeois economists had analyzed the economic anatomy of the classes. My own contribution was (1) to show that the existence of classes is bound up with certain historical phases in the development of production, (2) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat, (3) that this dictatorship itself constitutes only the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society." (Marx: "To J. Weydemeyer" (March 5, 1852). "Selected Works of Marx and Engels" (Two-Volume Edition), Volume 2, People's Publishing House, 1958, p. 452)

Fifty years ago, Lenin emphasized:

	"The main thing in Marxism is the class struggle. People often say and write this, but it is incorrect. Based on this incorrect view, Marxism is often distorted by opportunism, secretly changing Marxism into something that the bourgeoisie can accept. Because the theory of class struggle was not created by Marx but by the bourgeoisie before Marx, and generally speaking, it is something that the bourgeoisie can accept. Whoever only acknowledges the class struggle is not a Marxist; he may still be within the circle of bourgeois thought and bourgeois policy. To limit Marxism with the theory of class struggle is to split and distort Marxism, turning Marxism into something that the bourgeoisie can accept. Only those who acknowledge both the class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat are Marxists. The biggest difference between Marxists and vulgar petty-bourgeois (and big-bourgeois) elements lies here. This must be used as a touchstone to test whether one truly understands and acknowledges Marxism." ("The State and Revolution" (August-September 1917). "Collected Works of Lenin" Volume 25, People's Publishing House, 1958, pp. 398-399)

The author of "Cultivation," like all opportunists in the history of the international communist movement, fundamentally distorts and distorts Marxism. In this nearly 50,000-word book, although he piles up some abstract phrases about class struggle, he does not mention real class struggle, nor does he mention the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, those phrases about class struggle are naturally deceptive and can be fully accepted by the bourgeoisie.

"Cultivation" was published in July 1939 and reprinted many times during the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation. In several editions, it does not mention the Anti-Japanese War, the class struggle during the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, the class struggle during the War of Liberation, or the issue of seizing power. Such a "Cultivation" does not touch a single hair of Japanese imperialism, nor does it touch a single hair of American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang of Chiang Kai-shek.

Chairman Mao pointed out during the Anti-Japanese War: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." ("Problems of War and Strategy") "The development, consolidation, and Bolshevization of our Party have been carried out in revolutionary wars. Without armed struggle, there would be no Communist Party today." ("Editorial of the Communist") It is clear that without revolutionary war and armed seizure of power, one cannot talk about the development, consolidation, and construction of the Party, nor can one talk about the transformation of Party members' thinking. Yet, in the midst of the war, in the years of seizing power, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocates forgetting the fundamental task of armed seizure of power and engaging in "self-cultivation." To "cultivate" in this way is to cultivate people into those who do not engage in revolutionary war and do not seize power! Such "cultivated" people are not Communists but members of the Second International's Social Democratic Party.

"Cultivation" was revised and reprinted in August 1949 and extensively revised and reprinted in August 1962. It is still the same old stuff. In this period of revision and reprinting, "Cultivation" not only does not mention socialist revolution and class struggle in socialist society but also does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat at all. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party openly opposes Chairman Mao's series of great works, such as "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," "On People's Democratic Dictatorship," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," openly opposes Mao Zedong Thought, and advocates forgetting socialist revolution, forgetting class struggle in socialist society, forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, and engaging in "self-cultivation." Such "cultivation" is to cultivate people into Bukharin-like figures who do not engage in socialism but in capitalism, and into Khrushchev-like figures who do not want the dictatorship of the proletariat and seek to restore capitalism!

"Cultivation" has been reprinted and reprinted, but it does not mention armed seizure of power or the dictatorship of the proletariat. Is this an accidental oversight? No.

The book "Cultivation" discusses the issue of the state. A Marxist, when discussing the issue of the state, will certainly not fail to discuss the class nature of the state and the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, "Cultivation" deliberately omits the dictatorship of the proletariat and, like a bourgeois scholar, abstractly discusses the issue of the state.

The author of "Cultivation" says: The proletariat "can establish a party and state organs with strict organizational discipline to fight against all corruption, bureaucratization, and degeneration, and continuously purge those who have become corrupt, bureaucratized, and degenerate in their work from the party and state organs, and maintain the purity of the party and state organs." I ask, how can the proletariat establish its state organs? Can it be done without a violent revolution? Can it be done without smashing the old state machine? The book "Cultivation" precisely abandons this fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism. According to the author of "Cultivation," as long as Communists strive for "self-cultivation," a kind of "ideal state" will fall from the sky. What he dreams of is nothing but a bourgeois state.

The 1962 revised edition of "Cultivation" deliberately adds "establishing state organs that are both centralized and democratic" to the above-quoted passage. This deliberate addition shows the author's view of our state's nature. However, here and throughout the book, he does not mention the dictatorship over the enemy. Chairman Mao says: Our proletarian state practices dictatorship over the enemy and democratic centralism within the people. The author of "Cultivation" describes our state as merely a state that is "both centralized and democratic" and does not practice dictatorship over the enemy. Is this not opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, advocating Khrushchev's theory of the "all-people's state," and advocating the practice of bourgeois dictatorship?

The book "Cultivation" devotes a long section to describing "the communist cause as the greatest and most arduous undertaking in human history." A Marxist must emphasize here that communism can only be realized through the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the author does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat at all.

"What is the communist cause? What should our Party members do to carry out our cause?" The author answers: "In that world, there are no exploiters or oppressors, no landlords, capitalists, imperialists, and fascists, and there are no oppressed and exploited people or darkness, ignorance, and backwardness. In that society, all people become communists with high cultural and technological levels, selfless, intelligent, and full of mutual help and love, with no 'backstabbing,' mutual harm, mutual killing, and war and other unreasonable things. That society is certainly the best, most beautiful, and most progressive society in human history." The author says: "We Communists should have the greatest spirit and revolutionary determination. Every Party member should resolutely decide to undertake this greatest and most arduous task in human history with joy and seriousness." After making a series of such priestly prayers and wishes, the author concludes: "This is what I understand the communist cause to be." In the author's answer, he talks about everything being beautiful, with no darkness, no contradictions, everything being good, and no opposites. Society thus stops developing, and not only does the quality of society remain unchanged forever, but even the quantity of society seems to remain unchanged forever. The development of society thus ends, remaining the same forever. Here, the author throws away a fundamental law of Marxism—that any thing, any human society, develops through the struggle of opposites, through contradictions.

Marx said: "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat." ("Critique of the Gotha Program." "Collected Works of Marx and Engels" Volume 19, People's Publishing House, 1963, p. 31)

Lenin said: "The development towards communism must pass through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot take any other path, because there is no other person and no other path that can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalist class." ("The State and Revolution" (August-September 1917). "Collected Works of Lenin" Volume 25, People's Publishing House, 1958, p. 448)

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party emphasizes in "Cultivation" that after the proletariat's political victory, "it must still go through a long period of socialist transformation before it can gradually transition to a communist society." A person with even a slight Marxist flavor would certainly mention the dictatorship of the proletariat here! No, not a word! It is clear that the "long period of transformation" he talks about is not the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the "gradual transition to a communist society" he talks about is not the path of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Obviously, the author of "Cultivation" has a complete ideological system: to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and "carry out the communist cause." This is a thorough betrayal of scientific communism, a thorough betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and thorough revisionism.

The author of "Cultivation" not only does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat himself but also, when quoting two passages from Lenin, cuts out the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Lenin's original words are as follows:

	"The resistance of the bourgeoisie, because it has been overthrown (even in one country), becomes ten times more ferocious. Its strength lies not only in the power of international capital, not only in its various international connections being strong and firm, but also in the power of habit, the power of small-scale production. Because, unfortunately, there is still a lot of small-scale production in the world today, and small-scale production constantly, every day, spontaneously, and in large numbers, produces capitalism and the bourgeoisie. For all these reasons, the dictatorship of the proletariat is necessary, and without a protracted, tenacious, and life-and-death struggle, that is, without a persistent, disciplined, tenacious, and united-willed struggle, it is impossible to defeat the bourgeoisie."

The various editions of "Cultivation," including the 1962 new edition, quote as follows:

	"The resistance of the bourgeoisie, because it has been overthrown (even in one country), becomes ten times more ferocious. Its strength lies not only in the power of international capital, not only in its various international connections being strong and firm, but also in the power of habit, the power of small-scale production. Because, unfortunately, there is still a lot of small-scale production in the world today, and small-scale production constantly, every day, spontaneously, and in large numbers, produces capitalism and the bourgeoisie. For all these reasons, ... without a protracted, tenacious, and life-and-death struggle, that is, without a persistent, disciplined, tenacious, and united-willed struggle, it is impossible to defeat the bourgeoisie."

The author of "Cultivation" thus blatantly cuts out "the dictatorship of the proletariat is necessary" from the middle. Is this an accidental oversight? It is clear that in the eyes of this biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the dictatorship of the proletariat is unnecessary.

Another passage, Lenin's original words are as follows:

	"The abolition of classes is not just the expulsion of landlords and capitalists—this we have already relatively easily done—but also the abolition of small commodity producers. However, these people cannot be expelled or suppressed; they must be dealt with amicably; they can (and must) be transformed and re-educated, but this can only be done through long-term, slow, and cautious organizational work. They surround the proletariat with the spontaneous force of petty-bourgeois elements from all sides, infiltrate the proletariat, corrupt the proletariat, and constantly cause the old diseases of petty-bourgeois cowardice, disintegration, individualism, and the transition from enthusiasm to despair to recur within the proletariat. The internal affairs of the proletarian party must implement extremely strict centralism and extremely strict discipline in order to resist this evil influence and enable the proletariat to correctly, effectively, and victoriously play its organizational role (which is its main role). The dictatorship of the proletariat is the tenacious struggle of the proletariat against the old social forces and traditions, that is, the bloody and non-bloody, forceful and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative struggle. The habit of millions of people is the most terrible force. Without a party that has been tempered in struggle, a party that is trusted by the entire class, a party that is good at examining and influencing the masses' emotions, it is impossible to smoothly carry out this struggle. To defeat a strong and centralized bourgeoisie is a thousand times easier than to 'defeat' millions of small proprietors. And these small proprietors, with their daily, trivial, and invisible corrupting activities, create the evil consequences that the bourgeoisie needs to restore itself."

The various editions of "Cultivation," including the 1962 new edition, quote as follows:

	"The abolition of classes is not just the expulsion of landlords and capitalists—this we have already relatively easily done—but also the abolition of small commodity producers. However, these people cannot be expelled or suppressed; they must be dealt with amicably; they can (and must) be transformed and re-educated, but this can only be done through long-term, slow, and cautious organizational work. They surround the proletariat with the spontaneous force of petty-bourgeois elements from all sides, infiltrate the proletariat, corrupt the proletariat, and constantly cause the old diseases of petty-bourgeois cowardice, disintegration, individualism, and the transition from enthusiasm to despair to recur within the proletariat. The internal affairs of the proletarian party must implement extremely strict centralism and extremely strict discipline in order to resist this evil influence and enable the proletariat to correctly, effectively, and victoriously play its organizational role (which is its main role). ... The habit of millions of people is the most terrible force. ... To defeat a strong and centralized bourgeoisie is a thousand times easier than to 'defeat' millions of small proprietors. And these small proprietors, with their daily, trivial, and invisible corrupting activities, create the evil consequences that the bourgeoisie needs to restore itself."

The author of "Cultivation" again blatantly cuts out "the dictatorship of the proletariat is the tenacious struggle of the proletariat against the old social forces and traditions, that is, the bloody and non-bloody, forceful and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative struggle." Even the leadership of the Communist Party is cut out. Is this again an accidental oversight?

Why did "Cultivation" still cut out the dictatorship of the proletariat in the 1962 revision and reprint? There can only be one explanation: to oppose our proletarian dictatorship state and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

This fully proves that this biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the sworn enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He absolutely cannot tolerate the dictatorship of the proletariat and must cut it out as soon as he sees "the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party thus shamelessly castrates the soul of Marxism-Leninism.

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party betrays the dictatorship of the proletariat and talks about "being the best student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin." This is a great insult to Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

The 1962 revised edition of "Cultivation" changes "being the best student of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin" to "being a good student of Marx and Lenin" and deletes all three passages originally quoted from Chapter 4 of the "Short Course on the History of the CPSU (Bolsheviks)." These three passages are:

	"People and nature struggle and utilize nature to produce material means of subsistence, not in isolation from each other, not in isolation from each other, but as a group, as a society. Therefore, production at any time and under any conditions is social production. People, in the process of realizing the production of material means of subsistence, also establish certain mutual relations within production, that is, certain production relations."

	"The first characteristic of production is that it never stays still for long but is always in a state of change and development. At the same time, changes in the mode of production necessarily bring about changes in the entire social system, social ideas, political views, and political institutions, that is, changes in the entire social and political structure."

	"Only what is being born and developing is invincible."

It is clear that the author of "Cultivation," in 1962, deleted Stalin and the entire quoted text from Chapter 4 of the "Short Course on the History of the CPSU (Bolsheviks)" to fully cater to the needs of the Soviet revisionist clique, to oppose Stalin, and thus to oppose Leninism.

He deleted Stalin, and Engels was also implicated and deleted.

In multiple reprints and re-editions, "Cultivation" does not mention being a good student of Chairman Mao and does not mention Mao Zedong Thought. This also shows that the author of "Cultivation" is a fake Marxist and a true revisionist. Because, in our era, without Mao Zedong Thought, one is fundamentally deviating from Marxism-Leninism. This is the same as the development of Marxism to Leninism. Without Leninism, one is fundamentally deviating from Marxism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it." ("This Year's Elections")

The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, however, does the opposite, opposing the proletariat and Communists seizing and consolidating power, and reducing everything in the world to "self-cultivation."

	"Cultivation is everything, the goal is nothing."—This is the formula of "Cultivation." This formula, like the old traitor Bernstein's formula of "movement is everything, the goal is nothing," is pure revisionist goods.

Is there really no goal? Of course not. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, like the old traitor Bernstein, has his sinister, unspoken goal. He attempts to disintegrate the proletarian ranks, making people the more they "cultivate," the more they become revisionists. Before the nationwide victory, he opposes the proletariat seizing power; after the nationwide victory, he opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat and attempts to implement capitalism and restore capitalism. This is the goal of his reactionary formula of "cultivation is everything, the goal is nothing."

	(Note) Before 1962, all editions of "Cultivation" did not mention the Anti-Japanese War. In the 1962 new edition, in the section "Theoretical Study and Ideological Cultivation Are Unified," as an example, a passage about the policy of the United Front against Japanese aggression was added.

### 《修养》的要害是背叛无产阶级专政

    《修养》的要害是背叛无产阶级专政
    红旗杂志编辑部　人民日报编辑部
    世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。
             毛泽东
    《修养》一书，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的代表作。这本书，是反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的大毒草。它流毒全国，流毒世界。对它必须进行彻底的批判。
    《修养》一书的要害是什么呢？
    它的要害，就是背叛了马克思列宁主义的无产阶级专政学说。而背叛了无产阶级专政学说，就是完全地、彻底地背叛了马克思列宁主义，就是完全地、彻底地背叛了无产阶级的革命事业。
    马克思在一百多年以前就指出：
    “至于讲到我呢，那末无论是发现近代社会中有阶级存在或发现各阶级彼此斗争，都不是我的功劳。在我以前很久，资产阶级的历史学家就已叙述了这阶级斗争的历史发展，而资产阶级的经济学家则早已作过对于各个阶级的经济解剖了。我所作出的新东西就在于证明下列几点：（一）阶级的存在仅仅是跟生产发展的一定历史阶段相联系的；（二）阶级斗争必然要引导到无产阶级专政；（三）这个专政本身不过是进到消灭任何阶级和进到无阶级社会的过渡”。（马克思：《致约·卫登麦尔》（一八五二年三月五日）。《马克思恩格斯文选（两卷集）》第二卷，人民出版社一九五八年版，第四五二页）列宁
    在五十年以前又强调指出：
      “马克思学说中的主要内容是阶级斗争。人们时常这样说，这样写。但这是不正确的。根据这个不正确的观点，往往会对马克思主义进行机会主义的歪曲，把马克思主义偷偷地改为资产阶级可以接受的东西。因为阶级斗争学说不是由马克思，而是由资产阶级在马克思以前创立的，而且一般说来，是资产阶级可以接受的。谁要是仅仅承认阶级斗争，那他还不是马克思主义者，他可能还没有走出资产阶级思想和资产阶级政策的圈子。用阶级斗争学说来限制马克思主义，就是割裂和歪曲马克思主义，把马克思主义变为资产阶级可以接受的东西。只有承认阶级斗争、同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。马克思主义者同庸俗小资产者（以及大资产者）之间的最大区别就在这里。必须用这块试金石来测验是否真正了解和承认马克思主义。”（《国家与革命》（一九一七年八——九月）。《列宁全集》第二十五卷，人民出版社一九五八年版，第三九八——三九九页）
    《修养》的作者，同国际共产主义运动历史上的一切机会主义者一样，从根本上对马克思主义进行了割裂和歪曲。他在这本长达近五万字的书里，虽然也堆积了一些抽象的阶级斗争的词句，但是闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，闭口不提无产阶级专政。不要无产阶级专政，那些阶级斗争的词句当然只是骗人的鬼话，当然是资产阶级完全可以接受的。
    《修养》于一九三九年七月出版，抗日战争时期和解放战争时期多次重印。在几种版本里，根本不谈抗日战争、不谈抗日战争时期的阶级斗争（注），根本不谈解放战争、不谈解放战争时期的阶级斗争，根本不谈夺取政权问题。这样的《修养》，触动不了日本帝国主义的一根毫毛，触动不了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石国民党的一根毫毛。
    毛主席在抗日战争时期指出：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”（《战争和战略问题》）“我们党的发展、巩固和布尔塞维克化，是在革命战争中进行的，没有武装斗争，就不会有今天的共产党。”（《〈共产党人〉发刊词》）很显然，抛开革命战争，抛开武装夺取政权，就根本谈不到党的发展、巩固和建设，谈不到党员的思想改造。可是，就在炮火连天的战争的年代里，夺取政权的年代里，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，却要人们忘记武装夺取政权的根本任务去进行“自我修养”。这样去“修养”，岂不是要人们“修”成不干革命战争，不要夺取政权的庸人！这样“修”出来的庸人，绝不是共产党人，而是第二国际的社会民主党人。
      《修养》在一九四九年八月修订再版，在一九六二年八月大加增删，重新出版，仍然是原来的那套货色。在这个时期修订再版、重新出版的《修养》，不但根本不谈社会主义革命，社会主义社会的阶级斗争，而且仍然只字不提无产阶级专政。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，公然同毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》、《论人民民主专政》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等一系列伟大著作唱对台戏，公然反对毛泽东思想，要人们忘记社会主义革命，忘记社会主义社会的阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，去进行“自我修养”。这样的“修养”，岂不是让人们“修”成不搞社会主义，而搞资本主义的布哈林式的人物，“修”成不要无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的赫鲁晓夫式的人物！
    《修养》多次重印和再版，都不提武装夺取政权，不提无产阶级专政，是不是偶然的疏忽呢？不是。
    《修养》一书讲了国家问题。一个马克思主义者在讲国家问题的时候，是绝对不会不讲国家的阶级性质，绝对不会不讲无产阶级专政的。可是，《修养》一书偏偏抛开无产阶级专政，而象资产阶级的御用学者那样，抽象地讲国家问题。
      《修养》一书的作者说：无产阶级“能够建立有严格组织纪律的党及国家机关，来和一切腐化、官僚化与堕落现象进行不调和的斗争，不断从党内与国家机关中清洗那些已经在自己的工作中腐化、官僚化与堕落的分子出去”，“而保持党与国家机关的纯洁”。试问，无产阶级怎样才能建立自己的国家机关呢？难道可以不经过暴力革命吗？可以不打碎旧的国家机器吗？《修养》一书恰恰是抛弃了马克思列宁主义的这个根本原理。照《修养》一书作者看来，只要共产党人努力进行“自我修养”，就会从天上掉下一个什么“理想国”来。他梦寐以求的，不是别的，就是资产阶级国家。
    一九六二年再版的《修养》，在上面引的这一段话中，特意增加了“建立又有集中又有民主的国家机关”。这种特意的增加，表明作者对我们国家性质的看法。可是，在这里，在全书，他根本不提对阶级敌人的专政。毛主席说：我们的无产阶级国家，对于阶级敌人实行专政，“在人民内部是实行民主集中制”。《修养》一书的作者，把我们的国家，说成仅仅是“又有集中又有民主”，不向敌人实行专政的国家，这不是反对无产阶级专政，宣扬赫鲁晓夫的“全民国家”论，主张实行资产阶级专政，又是什么呢？
    《修养》一书用了很长的篇幅描绘“共产主义事业是人类历史上空前伟大而艰难的事业”。一个马克思主义者，在这里一定要讲必须经过无产阶级专政才能实现共产主义。可是，作者却只字不提无产阶级专政。
    “共产主义事业到底是什么一回事？我们党员到底要怎样去进行我们的事业？”作者回答说：“在那种世界里，没有剥削者、压迫者，没有地主、资本家、帝国主义和法西斯蒂等，也没有受压迫、受剥削的人民及黑暗、愚蠢、落后等。在那种社会里，人类都成为有高等文化程度与技术水平的、大公无私的、聪明的共产主义者，人类中彼此充满了互相帮助、互相亲爱，没有‘尔虞我诈’、互相危害、互相残杀及战争等等不合理的事情。那种社会，当然是人类史上最好的、最美丽的、最进步的社会。”作者又说：“我们共产党员，应该有人类最伟大的气魄与革命的决心。每一个党员都应该愉快而严肃地下定自己的决心，来担负实现共产主义这种人类史上空前伟大而艰难的任务。”作者在作了类似种种一连串的牧师式的祈祷和祝愿之后，做出结论说：“我所了解的共产主义事业，就是这么一回事。”在作者的回答里，说得天花乱坠，就是不要无产阶级专政。他所了解的共产主义事业，他所主张的怎样去进行共产主义事业，原来就是这样！
    这种对于共产主义社会的描绘，不是什么新的东西，是古已有之的。在中国，有《礼运·大同篇》，有陶潜的《桃花源记》，有康有为的《大同书》，在外国，有法国和英国空想社会主义者的大批著作，都是这一路货色。
    照作者的意见，共产主义社会里，一切都是美好的，一点黑暗也没有，一点矛盾也没有，一切都好了，没有对立物了。社会从此停止发展，不但社会的质永远不变化，连社会的量似乎也永远不变化了，社会的发展就此终结，永远一个样子。在这里，作者把马克思主义一个基本规律抛掉了——任何事物，任何一个人类社会，都是由对立斗争，由矛盾而推动发展的。作者在这里宣扬了形而上学，抛弃了伟大的辩证唯物论和历史唯物论。
    马克思说：“在资本主义社会和共产主义社会之间，有一个从前者变为后者的革命转变时期。同这个时期相适应的也有一个政治上的过渡时期，这个时期的国家只能是无产阶级的革命专政。”（《哥达纲领批判》。《马克思恩格斯全集》第十九卷，人民出版社一九六三年版，第三十一页）
    列宁说：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”（《国家与革命》（一九一七年八——九月）。《列宁全集》第二十五卷，人民出版社一九五八年版，第四四八页）
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在《修养》一书里着重讲了无产阶级在政治上胜利以后，“还须经过社会主义的长期的改造时代，最后才能逐渐过渡到共产主义社会去”。一个稍有马克思主义气味的人，在这里总会提到无产阶级专政吧！没有，没有，还是一句也没有！可见，他所说的“长期的改造时代”，不是无产阶级专政的时代，他所说的“逐渐过渡到共产主义社会”的道路，不是无产阶级专政的道路。
    很显然，《修养》一书的作者，有一个完整的思想体系：就是不要无产阶级专政，去“进行共产主义事业”。这是对于科学共产主义的彻头彻尾的背叛，这是对于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻头彻尾的背叛，这是彻头彻尾的修正主义。
    《修养》一书的作者，不仅自己不提无产阶级专政，而且在引用列宁的两段话时，也把无产阶级专政剜掉了。
    列宁的原话是这样说的：
    “资产阶级的反抗，因为自己被推翻（哪怕是在一个国家内）而凶猛十倍。它的强大不仅在于国际资本的力量，不仅在于它的各种国际联系牢固有力，而且还在于习惯的力量，小生产的力量。因为，可惜现在世界上还有很多很多小生产，而小生产是经常地、每日每时地、自发地和大批地产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。由于这一切原因，无产阶级专政是必要的，而且不经过持久的、顽强的、殊死的战斗，即不经过坚持不懈、纪律严格、坚忍不拔和意志统一的战斗，便不能战胜资产阶级。”
    《修养》一书的各种版本，包括一九六二年的新版，却是这样引用的：
    “资产阶级的反抗，因为自己被推翻（哪怕是在一个国家内）而凶猛十倍。它的强大不仅在于国际资本的力量，不仅在于它的各种国际联系牢固有力，而且还在于习惯的力量，小生产的力量。因为，可惜现在世界上还有很多很多小生产，而小生产是经常地、每日每时地、自发地和大批地产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。由于这一切原因，……不经过持久的、顽强的、殊死的战斗，即不经过坚持不懈、纪律严格、坚忍不拔和意志统一的战斗，便不能战胜资产阶级。”
    《修养》一书的作者，就是这样明目张胆地拦腰把“无产阶级专政是必要的”砍掉了。难道这是偶然的疏忽吗！很明白，在这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派看来，无产阶级专政是不必要的。
    另外一段，列宁的原话是这样说的：“消灭阶级不仅仅是驱逐地主和资本家，——这个我们已经比较容易地做到了，——还要消灭小商品生产者，可是对于这种人既不能驱逐，又不能镇压，必须同他们和睦相处；可以（而且必须）改造他们，重新教育他们，这只有通过长期的、缓慢的、谨慎的组织工作才能做到。他们用小资产阶级的自发势力从各方面来包围无产阶级，浸染无产阶级，腐蚀无产阶级，经常使小资产阶级的懦弱性、涣散性、个人主义以及由狂热转为灰心等旧病在无产阶级内部复发起来。无产阶级政党的内部需要实行极严格的集中制和极严格的纪律，才能抵制这种恶劣影响，才能使无产阶级正确地、有效地、胜利地发挥自己的组织作用（这是它的主要作用）。无产阶级专政是无产阶级为反对旧社会的势力和传统而进行的顽强斗争，即流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争。千百万人的习惯势力是最可怕的势力。没有在斗争中百炼成钢的党，没有为本阶级全体忠实的人所信赖的党，没有善于考察群众情绪和影响群众情绪的党，要顺利地进行这种斗争是不可能的。战胜强大而集中的资产阶级，要比‘战胜’千百万小业主容易千百倍。而这些小业主用他们日常的、琐碎的、看不见摸不着的腐化活动制造着为资产阶级所需要的，使资产阶级得以复辟的恶果。”
    《修养》一书的各种版本，包括一九六二年的新版，却是这样引用的：
    “消灭阶级不仅仅是驱逐地主和资本家，——这个我们已经比较容易地做到了，——还要消灭小商品生产者，可是对于这种人既不能驱逐，又不能镇压，必须同他们和睦相处；可以（而且必须）改造他们，重新教育他们，这只有通过长期的、缓慢的、谨慎的组织工作才能做到。他们用小资产阶级的自发势力从各方面来包围无产阶级，浸染无产阶级，腐蚀无产阶级，经常使小资产阶级的懦弱性、涣散性、个人主义以及由狂热转为灰心等旧病在无产阶级内部复发起来。无产阶级政党的内部需要实行极严格的集中制和极严格的纪律，才能抵制这种恶劣影响，才能使无产阶级正确地、有效地、胜利地发挥自己的组织作用（这是它的主要作用）。……千百万人的习惯势力是最可怕的势力。……战胜强大而集中的资产阶级，要比‘战胜’千百万小业主容易千百倍。而这些小业主用他们日常的、琐碎的、看不见摸不着的腐化活动制造着为资产阶级所需要的，使资产阶级得以复辟的恶果。”
    《修养》的作者，又明目张胆地拦腰砍掉了“无产阶级专政是无产阶级为反对旧社会的势力和传统而进行的顽强斗争，即流血的与不流血的，强力的与和平的，军事的与经济的，教育的与行政的斗争。”连共产党的领导也给砍掉了。难道这又是偶然的疏忽吗！
    《修养》在一九六二年重新修改出版，为什么仍然把无产阶级专政删掉呢？这只能有一个解释，就是：反对我们的无产阶级专政的国家，要把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。
    这完全可以证明，这个最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是无产阶级专政的死对头，他是绝对不能容忍无产阶级专政的，一看到“无产阶级专政”，就一定要把它砍掉。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这样无耻地阉割马克思列宁主义灵魂的。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，而讲什么“作马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的最好的学生”，这简直是对马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的莫大侮辱。
    一九六二年再版的《修养》，把“作马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的最好的学生”，改为“作马克思和列宁的好学生”，还把原来引用的《联共（布）党史简明教程》第四章的三段话全部删去了。这三段话是：
    “人们和自然界斗争以及利用自然界来生产物质资料，并不是彼此孤立，彼此隔绝，各人单独进行，而是以团体为单位，以社会为单位来共同进行的。因此，生产在任何时候以及在任何条件下，都是社会的生产。人们在实现物质资料生产时，也就建立彼此间在生产内部的某种相互关系，即某种生产关系”。
    “生产底第一个特点就是它永远也不会长久停留在一点上，而是始终处在变更和发展状态中。同时，生产方式中的变更，又必然引起全部社会制度、社会观念、政治观点和政治制度底变更，即引起全部社会的和政治的结构底改造”。
    “只有正在产生，正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。”
    很明显，《修养》的作者，在一九六二年删掉斯大林，删掉原来引用的《联共（布）党史简明教程》第四章的全部引文，完全是为了迎合苏联修正主义集团的需要，反斯大林，也就是反列宁主义。
    他为了删掉斯大林，恩格斯也被陪绑，恩格斯也被删掉了。
    《修养》一书在多次重印和再版中，根本不讲做毛主席的好学生，根本不提毛泽东思想。这一点，也说明《修养》的作者是假马克思主义者、真修正主义者。因为，在我们的时代，离开了毛泽东思想，就是从根本上背离了马克思列宁主义。这同马克思主义发展到列宁主义阶段一样，离开了列宁主义，也就是从根本上背离了马克思主义。
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”（《今年的选举》）
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，却反其道而行之，不要无产阶级和共产党人夺取政权，巩固政权，而把世界上的一切归结为“自我修养”。
    “修养就是一切，目的是没有的。”——这就是《修养》一书的公式。这个公式，同老叛徒伯恩斯坦的“运动就是一切，目的是没有的”公式一样，都是十足的修正主义货色。
    真的没有目的吗？当然不是。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，同老叛徒伯恩斯坦一样，有其阴险的、不可告人的目的。他企图瓦解无产阶级队伍，使人们越“养”越“修”，越“修养”越成为修正主义，在全国胜利以前，他反对无产阶级夺取政权；在全国胜利以后，他反对无产阶级专政，妄图实行资本主义、复辟资本主义。这就是他的“修养就是一切，目的是没有的”这个反动公式的目的。
      （注）《修养》一书，在一九六二年以前的各种版本里，都没有谈抗日战争。一九六二年的新版中，在“理论学习和思想意识修养是统一的”一节里，作为举例，加了关于抗日民族统一战线政策的一段。
