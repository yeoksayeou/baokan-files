To the Standing Committee Comrades:

I am sending you the minutes of the symposium on the army's literary and artistic work convened by Comrade Jiang Qing. Please review. This set of minutes has been repeatedly studied and revised by the participants of the symposium, and has been personally reviewed and edited three times by Chairman Mao. It is an excellent document that uses Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major questions of the cultural revolution in the socialist period. It not only has great practical significance but also has profound historical significance.

Over the past sixteen years, there has been sharp class struggle on the literary and artistic front. The issue of who will defeat whom has not been resolved. If the proletariat does not occupy this position, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. Struggle is inevitable. This is an extremely broad and profound socialist revolution in the ideological realm. If we do not handle it well, revisionism will emerge. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry this revolution through to the end.

The problems and opinions raised in the minutes are completely in line with the actual situation of the army's literary and artistic work and must be resolutely implemented to make the army's literary and artistic work play an important role in emphasizing politics and promoting the revolutionization of people.

Please share any opinions on the minutes so that they can be reported to the Central Committee for approval.

	Yours respectfully,
	Lin Biao
	March 22, 1966

### 林彪同志给中央军委常委的信

专栏：

    林彪同志给中央军委常委的信常委诸同志：
    送去江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要，请阅。这个纪要，经过参加座谈会的同志们反复研究，又经过主席三次亲自审阅修改，是一个很好的文件，用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，不仅有极大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义。
    十六年来，文艺战线上存在着尖锐的阶级斗争，谁战胜谁的问题还没有解决。文艺这个阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领，斗争是不可避免的。这是在意识形态领域里极为广泛、深刻的社会主义革命，搞不好就会出修正主义。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地把这一场革命进行到底。
    纪要中提出的问题和意见，完全符合部队文艺工作的实际情况，必须坚决贯彻执行，使部队文艺工作在突出政治、促进人的革命化方面起重要作用。
    对纪要有何意见望告，以便报中央审批。
    		此致
    敬礼！							林彪					一九六六年三月二十二日
