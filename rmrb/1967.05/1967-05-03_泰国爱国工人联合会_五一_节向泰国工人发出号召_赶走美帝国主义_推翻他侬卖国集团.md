The Federation of Patriotic Workers of Thailand issued a call to Thai workers on May Day, urging them to drive out American imperialism and overthrow the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on May 2, Bangkok: The "Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted on May 1 that the Federation of Patriotic Workers of Thailand issued a letter to Thai workers on May Day, the International Labor Day. The letter called on all Thai workers to fully support the Thai people's patriotic armed forces, to drive out American imperialism from Thailand as soon as possible, and to overthrow the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique.

The letter to Thai workers pointed out that the Sarit-Thanom clique has been steadfastly following American imperialism, turning Thailand into a new colony of American imperialism. The Sarit-Thanom clique has always allowed American imperialism to use Thailand as a base for bombing Vietnam and invading neighboring countries, dispatching land, sea, and air forces to help American imperialism massacre the Vietnamese people. This year in March, they went even further by openly allowing U.S. B-52 bombers to be stationed in Thailand, permitting the United States to set up missile bases and radar networks at will.

The letter to Thai workers emphasized that to end the workers' impoverished and oppressed lives, they must fight. The Thai working class has indeed risen up to fight. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year alone, more than 20,000 Thai workers participated in relatively large-scale struggles.

The letter to Thai workers pointed out that currently, the patriotic armed forces organized by the broad masses of the Thai people are waging a heroic armed struggle. This armed force is growing stronger in the northeastern, northern, central, and southern regions, fighting tenaciously against the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" by the U.S.-Thai reactionary clique.

The letter said, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries are unwilling to accept their defeat. They are inhumanely persecuting and killing patriotic people every day. However, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries are paper tigers. Their use of inhuman methods against the people does not indicate their strength but rather their weakness. The more savage and brutal they are, the closer they are to death. As long as we remain united and persist in fighting to the end, ultimate victory will be ours.

Since its establishment on May 1, 1965, the Federation of Patriotic Workers of Thailand has consistently directed its struggle against American imperialism and the Sarit-Thanom traitorous clique. The Federation of Patriotic Workers of Thailand has made significant contributions in organizing the Thai working class to fight for Thailand's independence and democracy.

    泰国爱国工人联合会“五一”节向泰国工人发出号召
    赶走美帝国主义　推翻他侬卖国集团
    据新华社二日讯　曼谷消息：据“泰国人民之声”电台一日广播，泰国爱国工人联合会在“五一”国际劳动节发表致泰国工人书，呼吁泰国全体工人全力支持泰国人民爱国武装，为早日把美帝国主义赶出泰国，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团而斗争。
    致泰国工人书指出，他侬—巴博集团死心塌地追随美帝国主义，已经使泰国沦为美帝国主义的新殖民地。他侬—巴博集团一直让美帝国主义利用泰国作为轰炸越南和侵略邻国的基地，派陆、海、空部队帮助美帝国主义屠杀越南人民。今年三月又变本加厉公然让美国B—52型轰炸机进驻泰国，让美国任意在泰国设立导弹基地和雷达网。
    致泰国工人书强调指出，要结束工人的这种贫困和受压迫受剥削的生活，只有进行斗争。泰国工人阶级也确实起来斗争了。据不完全的统计，在去年一年中，参加比较大规模斗争的泰国工人就有二万多人。
    致泰国工人书指出，目前，由泰国广大爱国人民组织的爱国武装队伍正在进行英勇的武装斗争。这支武装队伍在东北部、北部、中部和南部广大地区日益发展壮大，同美、泰反动集团的反革命“围剿”进行顽强的斗争。
    致泰国工人书说，美、泰反动派不甘心于它们的失败，它们每日都在惨无人道地迫害和枪杀爱国人民。但是美、泰反动派都是纸老虎，它们使用灭绝人性的手段对付人民，并不表明它们的强大，而只是表明它们的虚弱，它们越是野蛮残暴，就越接近死亡，只要我们紧密团结，坚持不懈地斗争到底，最后胜利一定属于我们。
    泰国爱国工人联合会自一九六五年五月一日成立以来，斗争的矛头一直是指向美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团。泰国爱国工人联合会在组织泰国工人阶级进行争取泰国的独立民主的斗争中作出了重要的贡献。
