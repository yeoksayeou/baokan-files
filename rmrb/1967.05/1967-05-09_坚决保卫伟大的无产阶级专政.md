Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, and other places' military and civilian population enthusiastically acclaim the *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* article hitting the crux of *Cultivation*

The crux of *Cultivation* is the betrayal of the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must seize this crux and thoroughly criticize and expose the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party.

According to Xinhua News Agency on May 8, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Guizhou, Shandong, and other places warmly welcomed the publication of the important article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is the Betrayal of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily*. Revolutionary factions in various places believe that in the current high tide of revolutionary criticism against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, this article has brought new and powerful ideological weapons to the broad revolutionary masses.

Today, many proletarian revolutionary factions in Beijing held meetings to discuss the article by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily*. Revolutionary workers at the meeting pointed out that the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party repeatedly threw out the big poisonous weed *Cultivation* with evil intentions, attempting to subvert our great dictatorship of the proletariat. We proletarian revolutionary factions must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our red mountains and rivers will never change color. Revolutionary factions in Pinggu County, suburbs of Beijing, said that the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party uses every means to prevent us from implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing us from waging class struggle, preventing us from building socialism. If we all follow his *Cultivation* to "cultivate," our country will definitely change color, and countless heads will fall. We must sweep the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party and his *Cultivation* into the dustbin of history. Revolutionary youngsters of the New Peking University said: "The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party fiercely opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and we must strive to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat."

In Shanghai, many units held study sessions and discussions today. The responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Ink Factory said that the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party does not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat in *Cultivation*, which is actually to implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. We proletarian revolutionary factions must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, unite the majority of the masses, firmly grasp power, use power well, and never let the socialist mountains and rivers of our country change color. The responsible person of the Red Guards of the New Normal University pointed out that the set of "self-cultivation" advocated in *Cultivation* by the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party is completely deceiving. Following him will only cultivate revolutionaries and revisionists serving the bourgeoisie. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, temper ourselves into strong successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the fiery class struggle.

The article by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* reached Heilongjiang Province, and the broad revolutionary masses enthusiastically welcomed this article as a heavy artillery shell fired at the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party in the current great criticism. The responsible person of the Red Guards Headquarters of Harbin said that we must remember Chairman Mao's instructions, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose this disciple of Bernstein along with his *Cultivation*. The red rebels of Harbin Second Tool Factory said that they must take up the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought, aim at the crux of *Cultivation*, and open fire fiercely, criticize it to the point of no escape, thoroughly eliminate its poison, and let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought shine more brilliantly. Members of the Revolutionary Committee of Harbin Tractor Parts Factory said that we proletarian revolutionary factions think day and night about the dictatorship of the proletariat and do the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, we have nothing. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party does not want the dictatorship of the proletariat and attempts to restore capitalism, which is a daydream. We will not agree to it, not even a thousand times.

The broad proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanxi listened to the broadcast of this important article over and over again. The Red Guards of the 32111 Commune of Taiyuan No. 6 Middle School, who have always been at the forefront of the Cultural Revolution, said that the dictatorship of the proletariat is our lifeline and the fundamental guarantee for socialist revolution and socialist construction. With the dictatorship of the proletariat, we have everything. We must resolutely defend and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and thoroughly criticize and expose the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party along with his *Cultivation*. A responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of Taiyuan City said that the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party is a thorough revisionist. In this current great criticism, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, combine the criticism of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party with the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee of Guiyang City, Du Zulin, pointed out that the article by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* provided us with sharp weapons for criticism. The author of *Cultivation* betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is fundamentally a betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must seize this crux and thoroughly eliminate the poison of *Cultivation*. The proletarian revolutionary factions of Guiyang Red Rock Chemical Factory indignantly said: The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party has always opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. He and imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries are of the same ilk and are the sworn enemies of our dictatorship of the proletariat. We must concentrate our firepower and targets to fight him down, fight him to stink, criticize him deeply, and criticize him thoroughly!

The responsible person of the Revolutionary Workers Temporary Headquarters of Shandong Province pointed out that the core and essence of Marxism-Leninism is the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is a thorough betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a thorough betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and a thorough traitor to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose this great traitor, and thoroughly eliminate all his poisons.

The responsible person of the Revolutionary Committee of Qingdao City said that in this current great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we proletarian revolutionary factions deeply feel that without the dictatorship of the proletariat and without the People's Liberation Army as the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the revolution cannot be victorious. We must use our blood and lives to defend the great dictatorship of the proletariat.

According to Xinhua News Agency on May 8, the publication of the article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is the Betrayal of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* has attracted great attention and enthusiastic acclaim from the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Shandong, and other places.

The officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force who have been supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, and have been fighting together with the proletarian revolutionary factions, today, while studying the important article by the editorial departments of *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily*, read Chairman Mao's instructions over and over again: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power, consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, also completely for maintaining their power." They learn the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao over and over again: "Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to highlight politics, never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought." The officers and soldiers said, the crux of *Cultivation* is the betrayal of the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought on the dictatorship of the proletariat. Betraying the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat is completely and thoroughly betraying Marxism-Leninism, betraying the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guarding the source of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat and the great capital, enthusiastically praised the article by *Red Flag* magazine and *People's Daily* as a fatal blow to the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party. Zhang Xuechen, the political instructor of a certain regiment who has been awarded the second-class merit, said, Chairman Mao taught us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party, in his big poisonous weed *Cultivation*, deliberately distorted right and wrong, confused black and white, talking about "cultivation" all the time, making cultivation everything, attempting to make us forget power, abandon power, make countless heads fall, and let the old society return. How poisonous it is! Shen Benhua, a female pilot of a certain air force unit in Beijing, said: "The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party hates the dictatorship of the proletariat to the bone, throwing out the big poisonous weed *Cultivation* time and time again, attempting to make us forget the dictatorship of the proletariat to 'self-cultivate,' cultivate into people who do not practice socialism but practice capitalism like Bukharin, cultivate into people who do not want the dictatorship of the proletariat but restore capitalism like Khrushchev. This is absolutely not allowed! We must defend the dictatorship of the proletariat with our lives!"

In the birthplace of the "January Storm" in Shanghai, the officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force of the People's Liberation Army pointed out that the publication of the article "The Crux of *Cultivation* is the Betrayal of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" is the advance signal of the current revolutionary great criticism mass movement. This article exposed the anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought essence of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party in one go, making him the target of public criticism. Some old soldiers who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan, the War of Liberation, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison Area said that the big poisonous weed *Cultivation* of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party completely goes against Chairman Mao's instructions, throwing away the revolutionary war, throwing away the armed seizure of power, and talking about the cultivation of Communist Party members. His sinister purpose is to make people forget the armed seizure of power, to turn our party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought into a revisionist party.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanxi held a study session today, and many officers and soldiers said: This article speaks the words in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world. It is a mirror that shines brightly, exposing the counter-revolutionary ugly face of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party who betrays the dictatorship of the proletariat. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team actively engaged in the front line of supporting the left in Taiyuan City immediately held a discussion after hearing the broadcast. The five-good soldier Wang Deqin said that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power, and the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party, when quoting Lenin's words in *Cultivation*, also blatantly cut off "the dictatorship of the proletariat" in the middle, which fully exposed his fear of violent revolution and his fear of the dictatorship of the proletariat, revealing his bourgeois nature. Li Guichun, the squad leader of the Communication First Company of a certain unit, said: *Cultivation* castrated the soul of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is a thorough betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. He cut off the real class struggle, which is to carry out the class struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat; he cut off the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is to implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; he talked about communism in vain, which is to restore capitalism.

The officers and soldiers of the military region headquarters and the units stationed in Guizhou Province warmly praised the article as a new manifesto for launching a great criticism against the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party, shining with the light of Mao Zedong Thought. Dai Jimin, a five-good soldier who made new contributions in supporting agriculture in a certain unit, said excitedly in the discussion: The number one capitalist-roader in power within the party in *Cultivation* tried to erase the real class struggle and did not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat at all, which was an attempt to restore capitalism and implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. We must remember Chairman Mao's instruction about "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," forever hold the gun for the people's revolutionary cause, defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the iron mountains and rivers of the proletariat last for thousands of years and never change color.

In Heilongjiang Province, He Yuanxun, the deputy platoon leader of the platoon where Liu Yingjun was stationed, said: Our Communist Party must emphasize the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is the magic weapon for the victory of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The author of *Cultivation* is terrified and hates the dictatorship of the proletariat to death, which fully exposes that he is a thorough counter-revolutionary and old revisionist. The officers and soldiers of the "Second Daizui" unit stationed in Shandong Province said excitedly at the discussion meeting: This article thinks what revolutionary soldiers think, hates what revolutionary soldiers hate, and speaks the words in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world. Platoon leader Xin Zuming said: In the past, our platoon fought south and north for the sake of fighting for a world of the dictatorship of the proletariat; today, our platoon participates in the front-line struggle of supporting the left for the sake of defending our world of the dictatorship of the proletariat. But the big poisonous weed *Cultivation* betrays the dictatorship of the proletariat, attempting to lead us to the evil path of closing the door to cultivate ourselves, in order to achieve its goal of restoring capitalism. We must do the opposite, practice the dictatorship of the proletariat for life, and be good pillars of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    北京上海黑龙江等地军民欢呼《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》文章击中《修养》要害
    坚决保卫伟大的无产阶级专政
    《修养》的要害，是背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的无产阶级专政学说。要抓住这个要害，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批臭。
    据新华社八日讯　北京、上海、黑龙江、山西、贵州、山东等地的无产阶级革命派，热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇重要文章的发表。各地无产阶级革命派认为，在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行革命大批判的高潮中，这篇文章给广大革命群众送来了新的强大的思想武器。
    北京今天有不少工厂企业的无产阶级革命派代表集会，座谈了《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部的文章。革命派职工在会上指出，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一再抛出《修养》这株大毒草的恶毒用心，就是妄图颠覆我们伟大的无产阶级专政。我们无产阶级革命派一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，保证我们红色的江山永不变色。郊区平谷县的革命派说，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派千方百计地不要我们搞无产阶级专政，不要我们搞阶级斗争，不要我们搞社会主义，如果我们都照他的《修养》去“修养”，我们的国家就一定要改变颜色，就会使千百万人头落地。我们一定要把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其《修养》扫进历史的垃圾堆。新北大的革命小将们说：“党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派拚命地反对无产阶级专政，我们就要全力地巩固无产阶级专政”。
    在上海，今天有许多单位的革命派举行了学习座谈会和讨论会。上海油墨厂革命委员会负责人说，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在《修养》一书中闭口不谈无产阶级专政，实际上就是要实行资产阶级专政。我们无产阶级革命派一定要遵照毛主席的教导，团结大多数群众，牢牢地掌好权，用好权，决不让我国社会主义江山改变颜色。华东师范大学红卫兵新师大师的负责人指出，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》一书中所宣扬的那一套“修身养性”术完全是欺人之谈，照他那样做只能培养革命的叛徒和为资产阶级服务的修正主义者。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，在火热的阶级斗争中把自己锻炼成坚强的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部的文章传到黑龙江省，广大革命群众热烈欢呼这篇文章是在大批判中对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派射出的一发重炮弹，击中了这个老修正主义分子及其《修养》的要害。哈尔滨市毛泽东思想红卫兵总部的负责人说，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把这个伯恩斯坦的门徒连同他的《修养》彻底批倒批臭。哈尔滨第二工具厂的红色造反者们表示，一定要拿起毛泽东思想的锐利武器，对准《修养》的要害猛烈开火，批它个体无完肤，彻底肃清其流毒，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想放射出更加灿烂的光芒。哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂革命委员会的成员说，我们无产阶级革命派日夜想的是无产阶级专政，干的也是无产阶级专政。如果没有无产阶级专政，就没有我们的一切。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派不要无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义，这是白日作梦，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    山西广大无产阶级革命派一遍又一遍地收听了这篇重要文章的广播。在无产阶级文化大革命中一贯冲锋陷阵的太原六中32111公社红卫兵小将们说，无产阶级专政是我们的命根子，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的根本保证。有了无产阶级专政，就有了一切。我们一定要坚决维护和加强无产阶级专政，把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派连同他的《修养》彻底批倒批臭。太原市革命委员会的一位负责人说，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是个彻头彻尾的修正主义分子。在当前这场革命的大批判中，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把批判党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和本单位的斗批改结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    贵阳市革命委员会副主任委员杜竹林指出，《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部的文章，给我们提供了锐利的批判武器。《修养》的作者背叛无产阶级专政，就是从根本上背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。我们一定要抓住这个要害问题，彻底肃清《修养》的流毒。贵阳红岩化工厂的无产阶级革命派愤慨地说：党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派一贯反对无产阶级专政，他和帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派完全是一丘之貉，是我们无产阶级专政的死对头。我们一定要集中火力，集中目标，把他斗倒、斗臭、批深、批透！
    山东省革命工人临时总指挥部的负责人指出，马克思列宁主义的核心和精髓就是无产阶级专政学说。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，就是彻底地背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，彻底地背叛了无产阶级革命事业，就是一个地地道道的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的大叛徒。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，把这个大叛徒斗倒、斗臭、批深、批透，彻底肃清其一切流毒。
    青岛市革命委员会负责人说，在当前这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，我们无产阶级革命派深深体会到如果没有无产阶级专政，没有人民解放军做无产阶级专政的柱石，革命就不能胜利。我们一定要用鲜血和生命来保卫伟大的无产阶级专政。
    据新华社八日讯　《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部的《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》一文的发表，引起了人民解放军驻北京、上海、山西、黑龙江、贵州、山东等地部队广大指战员的极大重视和热烈欢呼。
    在支左、支工、支农中和无产阶级革命派团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起的陆海空三军指战员，今天在学习《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部的这篇重要文章的时候，一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”一次又一次地学习林彪副主席的指示：“念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。”指战员们说，《修养》的要害，就是背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的无产阶级专政的学说，而背叛了无产阶级专政学说，也就是完全地、彻底地背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了无产阶级的革命事业。
    守卫在无产阶级文化大革命的策源地、伟大祖国首都的人民解放军指战员，热烈赞扬《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》的这篇文章给了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以致命的一击。荣立过二等战功的某部营教导员张学臣说，毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，在他的大毒草《修养》中，故意颠倒是非，混淆黑白，张口“修养”闭口“修养”，修养就是一切，妄图要我们忘记政权，丢掉政权，要我们千百万人头落地，让旧社会重来，真是何其毒也！驻京空军某部女飞行员沈本华说：“党内头号走资本主义道路当权派刻骨仇视无产阶级专政，一次又一次地抛出大毒草《修养》，妄图要我们忘记无产阶级专政去‘自我修养’，‘修’成不搞社会主义，专搞资本主义的布哈林式的人物，‘修’成不要无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的赫鲁晓夫式的人物。这一千个不行！一万个不行！我们一定要誓死保卫无产阶级专政！”
    在“一月风暴”的发源地上海，人民解放军陆海空三军指战员们指出，《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》一文的发表，是当前革命的大批判的群众运动深入发展的进军号，这篇文章把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的要害一下子就暴露无遗，成了众矢之的。上海警备区某部曾参加过抗日战争、解放战争、抗美援朝战争的一些老战士说，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》，完全违背了毛主席的教导，抛开了革命战争、抛开武装夺取政权，去空谈什么共产党员的修养，他的阴险目的就是要人们忘记武装夺取政权，要把我们马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的党变成修正主义的党。
    人民解放军驻山西地区指战员今天举行学习座谈会，许多指战员说：这篇文章说出了全国革命人民的心头话，也说出了全世界革命人民的心头话。它是一面光芒四射的照妖镜，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政的反革命狰狞面目，照得清清楚楚。活跃在太原市支左第一线的解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的干部战士听到广播后立即进行了座谈。五好战士王德钦说，革命的根本问题是政权问题，而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在他的《修养》里引用列宁的话时，也明目张胆地把“无产阶级专政”拦腰砍掉，这充分暴露了他最害怕暴力革命，最害怕无产阶级专政的资产阶级的本性。某部通信一连班长李贵春说：《修养》阉割了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的灵魂——无产阶级专政，就是彻底地背叛了无产阶级的革命事业。他砍掉现实的阶级斗争，正是进行资产阶级向无产阶级的阶级斗争；他砍掉无产阶级专政，正是为了实行资产阶级专政；他空谈共产主义，就是要复辟资本主义。
    贵州省军区机关和驻贵阳部队的指战员，热烈赞扬这篇文章闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉，是向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判的新的宣言书。在支援农业中做出了新贡献的某部五好战士戴吉明在讨论中激动地说：党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在《修养》中竭力抹煞现实的阶级斗争，只字不提无产阶级专政，就是妄图复辟资本主义，实行资产阶级专政。我们一定牢记毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，为人民的革命事业永远紧握枪杆子，保卫无产阶级专政，让无产阶级的铁打江山千秋万代，永不变色。
    在黑龙江省，刘英俊生前所在连的副连长何远顺说：我们共产党就是要大讲特讲无产阶级专政，这是中国革命和世界革命胜利的法宝。《修养》的作者，对无产阶级专政怕得要死，恨得要命，这充分暴露了他是彻头彻尾的老反革命、老修正主义。驻山东地区某部“第二岱崮连”的干部战士，在座谈会上兴奋地说：这篇文章想革命的战士所想，恨革命战士所恨，说出了全国革命人民和世界革命人民的心里话。连长辛祖明说：过去我们连南征北战，为的是打出一个无产阶级专政的天下；今天，我们连参加支左第一线的斗争，为的是保卫我们无产阶级专政的天下。可是《修养》这棵大毒草背叛无产阶级专政，企图把我们引向闭门修身养性的邪路，以达到它复辟资本主义的目的。我们就要反其道而行之，干一辈子无产阶级专政，当好无产阶级专政的柱石。
