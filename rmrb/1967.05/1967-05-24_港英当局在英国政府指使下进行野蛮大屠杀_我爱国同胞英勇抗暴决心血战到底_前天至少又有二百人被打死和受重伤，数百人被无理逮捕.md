The British authorities in Hong Kong, under the instructions of the British government, conducted a savage massacre on May 22, dispatching a large number of police and thousands of "riot control" troops. The Hong Kong authorities, after meticulous planning, sent a large number of police and special agents to surround the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China over the past few days. Yesterday, they launched a frenzied armed attack on the staff of our institutions in Hong Kong and people from all walks of life, shooting at close range and bathing the streets of Hong Kong in blood. Preliminary information indicates that at least 200 of our compatriots were killed or seriously injured, and the number of lightly injured is incalculable.

The compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, fearlessly faced the massacre by the Hong Kong authorities. They bravely fought back, fully demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Chinese nation to fight to the death with their enemies. They are indeed good sons and daughters of the motherland and good students of Chairman Mao.

According to the figures released by the Hong Kong authorities on the morning of May 23, which were greatly reduced, 363 of our institution staff and compatriots were unlawfully arrested yesterday, nearly 200 of whom were secretly arrested by Hong Kong special agents in the dead of night.

The compatriots of Hong Kong pointed out that the "May 22" massacre occurred the day after the British government sent Arthur Galsworthy, the Chief Deputy of the Commonwealth Relations Department, Cater, the Hong Kong Director of the Commonwealth Relations Department, and Boren, the Director of the Far East Department of the Foreign Office, to Hong Kong to discuss the "current situation in Hong Kong" with the Hong Kong "Governor" David Trench. The British government and the Hong Kong authorities are responsible for the bloody massacres on "May 6," "May 11," and "May 22" and must bear full responsibility.

On May 22, compatriots from various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon continued to send representatives to protest at the "Governor's Residence." At 10:30 AM, when 150 representatives from the publishing, trade, and banking industries in Hong Kong marched in an orderly manner to the "Governor's Residence" through the Garden Road intersection, about 400 to 500 Hong Kong "riot control" troops, who had long been trained in fascist methods and whose hands were stained with the blood of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots, led by foreign police officers, rushed from all directions towards the representatives' formation. They wielded batons and viciously struck the heads and lower bodies of the unarmed representatives, causing all the representatives to be severely injured and bleeding profusely. Many had their skulls fractured, and dozens were severely injured and unconscious, with blood staining their clothes and the streets of Hong Kong.

During the fascist thugs' beating, the representatives continued to hold high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang songs from the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist slogans. A young representative was surrounded by fifteen beast-like thugs, who continuously struck his head with fifteen batons, but he remained fearless. Until he was beaten unconscious, he still raised his arm and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The female staff of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Bookstore, who have long been at the forefront of promoting Mao Zedong Thought, have been targeted by the enemy. At the command of the British imperialist elements directing the massacre, every three thugs surrounded a female representative and beat her severely. More than ten female representatives were seriously injured. However, when they were being taken away in the police van, each of them held their heads high and glared angrily at the fascist wolves.

Fearful of exposing their crimes, the fascist thugs also attacked patriotic journalists, shouting, "All leftist journalists must be beaten." Hong Kong's "Economic Guide" reporter Xu Yuncheng was conducting normal interviews at the scene and was viciously beaten by a group of beasts. After being injured, Xu Yuncheng used all his strength to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao a thousand times!" The deranged fascist bandits, in a state of panic, struck Xu Yuncheng's head twice, knocking him unconscious.

From morning to night, Hong Kong was shrouded in a white terror. A worker was beaten to death by the fascist thugs. Another group of fascist thugs rushed into the Bank of Communications and fired three shots at the staff member Sun Hongji, who was guarding the bank's entrance. Sun Hongji was seriously injured in the chest and is in critical condition.

Just as the Hong Kong authorities were carrying out the bloody massacre, the U.S. "Consulate" in the vicinity set up guns, threatening our compatriots and cheering for the fascist thugs.

On the same day, in the "Magistrates' Courts" of South and North Kowloon and Causeway Bay, under the strict guard of armed Hong Kong police, our arrested compatriots were subjected to illegal secret interrogations. From 9:30 AM, queues of workers, students, and compatriots heading to protest at the "Magistrates' Courts" began to form. They loudly read Chairman Mao's quotations, sang revolutionary songs, and posted big-character posters. The Hong Kong authorities were terrified of these unarmed protest groups and immediately dispatched a large number of "riot control" troops to suppress them. After firing more than twenty tear gas canisters at the crowd, these fascist thugs rushed in and viciously beat our compatriots, striking at their heads, chests, and lower bodies. Even many elderly people, women, and children were not spared, and several compatriots were severely injured and collapsed. The blood on the ground was a bloody accusation against the imperialist "court."

The patriotic compatriots, when being viciously beaten by the enemy, remained steadfast and unyielding, their fighting spirit soaring. They held hands and read Chairman Mao's quotations in a passionate voice: "Resolutely decide to make sacrifices, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." They shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and cursed the fascist thugs. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings, caring for and helping each other. When the front compatriots fell, the ones behind immediately stepped forward. When batons flew towards the elderly and weak compatriots, those next to them immediately used their bodies to block. They were not afraid of the enemy's shields and batons, insisting on rescuing the severely injured compatriots.

Chairman Mao taught us: "All reactionaries are trying to use slaughter to eliminate the revolution. They think that the more people they kill, the smaller the revolution will be. However, contrary to this reactionary subjective wish, the fact is that the more people the reactionaries kill, the greater the revolutionary force will be, and the closer the reactionaries will be to annihilation. This is an irresistible law."

After the fascist thugs massacred the Garden Road intersection, beat and arrested more than 100 representatives, more compatriots immediately held high the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," wore golden Chairman Mao badges on their chests, shouted slogans, sang revolutionary songs, and charged towards the Hong Kong "Governor's Residence" to protest, breaking through the enemy's blockade.

The compatriots united as one, with a common hatred for the enemy, and held a massive demonstration on the streets. "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Blood for blood!" "Fight the anti-persecution struggle to the end!" "The British will be defeated! We will be victorious!" The slogan-shouting shook the entire sky of Hong Kong. The demonstrators' heroic actions were warmly praised and supported by workers, students, and residents along the route, as well as Chinese employees of foreign-owned businesses. They shouted, "Victory! Victory!" Many compatriots immediately joined the demonstration, angrily protesting the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong authorities. Along the way, some people brought tea and water to comfort them. Traffic workers drove cars to the center of the road to block police cars from passing, protecting the demonstrators. The enemy is most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought and the big-character posters, this new weapon, so our compatriots deliberately plastered the "Governor's Residence" and many Hong Kong authorities' buildings, as well as the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon, with Chairman Mao's quotation papers and big-character posters.

Hong Kong tram workers stopped their cars at 12:30 PM to protest. Public bus workers in Kowloon and Hong Kong also stopped driving from 12:30 PM for one hour to express their strong protest. At the Kowloon Star Ferry Pier terminal, when the workers stood in formation in front of the buses, shouting slogans and singing revolutionary songs, the Hong Kong authorities sent police to try to suppress them. A brave public bus driver drove the bus towards the fascist thugs, scaring them away. The enraged public bus workers, using the buses as cover, picked up stones and glass bottles, ready to fight back. Faced with the workers' immense power, the frightened fascist thugs dared not move an inch.

To plan further persecution actions, the Hong Kong authorities announced a curfew (martial law) in the Hong Kong Island urban area starting at 6:30 PM on May 22. During the curfew period, Hong Kong police and special agents continued to arrest our compatriots, who bravely fought back. The compatriots threw stones and glass bottles from the rooftops and houses at the fascist thugs, scaring them away.

The Hong Kong authorities' fascist suppression of Chinese compatriots has greatly escalated, and the anti-persecution struggle of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Chinese compatriots is also escalating.

    港英当局在英国政府指使下进行野蛮大屠杀
    我爱国同胞英勇抗暴决心血战到底
    前天至少又有二百人被打死和受重伤，数百人被无理逮捕
    新华社香港二十三日电　决心与中国人民为敌的英国政府和香港英国当局，二十二日派出大批警察和数以千计的“防暴队”，制造了空前规模的大屠杀。
    港英当局经过精心策划，这几天连续派出大批警察和特务包围我中国银行香港分行。昨天更向我驻港机构工作人员和各界同胞发动疯狂的武装袭击，近距离开枪，血洗香港街头。据初步了解，至少有二百名同胞被打死和受重伤，轻伤的不计其数。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的港九同胞，面对港英当局的大屠杀，不怕牺牲，前赴后继，进行了英勇的回击，充分表现了中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的英雄气概，他们不愧是祖国的好儿女，不愧是毛主席的好学生。
    据港英当局二十三日上午发表的大大缩小了的数字说，昨天有三百六十三名我驻港机构人员和同胞被无理逮捕，其中近二百名是在深夜被港英特务秘密逮捕的。
    香港同胞强调指出，“五·二二”血案是在英国政府五月二十一日指派联邦关系部首席次官阿瑟·高尔斯沃西、联邦关系部香港司长卡特和外交部远东司司长博兰到香港活动，同港英“总督”戴麟趾“讨论”“目前香港情况”的第二天发生的。英国政府和港英当局罪责难逃，必须对“五·六”、“五·一一”和“五·二二”等这几次血腥大屠杀负完全的责任。
    二十二日，港九各界同胞继续派遣出代表，前往港英“总督府”抗议。上午十时三十分，当我出版界、贸易界和银行界的职工代表一百五十多人有秩序地列队前往“总督府”经过花园道口时，四、五百名长期接受法西斯训练、双手染满港九同胞鲜血的港英“防暴队”，由洋警官率领，从四面八方冲向代表们的队伍，挥舞警棍，狠毒地向手无寸铁的代表们的头部和下体猛击，全部代表当场都被打得重伤，血流不止，许多人头颅破裂，几十人重伤昏迷，鲜血染红了他们的衣服，染红了祖国的土地——香港的街头。
    代表们在遭受法西斯暴徒毒打的时候，始终高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱毛主席语录歌《争取胜利》、《为人民而死，就是死得其所》，高呼反帝反修口号。一位青年代表被十五名野兽一样的暴徒包围着，十五枝警棍不停地打在他的头上，但他毫无惧色，直到被打昏前的最后一刻，他仍然振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    一直站在宣传毛泽东思想第一线的我港九爱国书店的女职工，早就被敌人看成眼中钉。指挥大屠杀的英帝国主义分子一声令下，每三个暴徒围着一位女代表毒打，十多位女代表都负了重伤。但是，当她们被押上囚车的时候，个个都昂着头，横眉怒对这批法西斯豺狼。
    港英法西斯暴徒害怕泄露罪行，他们在行凶的时候，还向爱国记者下了毒手，叫嚣“凡是左派记者都要打”。香港《经济导报》记者许云程在现场进行正常的采访活动，竟被一群野兽围着毒打。许云程受伤后用尽全力高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”丧心病狂的法西斯匪徒恐慌万状，竟向许云程的后脑猛击两下，把他打昏在地。
    从早晨到深夜，香港笼罩着一片白色恐怖的气氛。有一位工人被港英法西斯暴徒活活打死。另一群法西斯暴徒竟冲向我交通银行，对准守卫在银行大门内的职工孙宏基连发三枪，孙宏基的胸部中弹重伤，生命垂危。
    正当港英当局进行血腥大屠杀的时候，在现场附近的美国驻港“领事馆”竟然架起枪支，威胁我同胞，替港英法西斯暴徒助威。
    同一天，在南、北九龙“裁判署”和铜锣湾“裁判署”，在港英当局武装警察严密戒备下，对我被捕同胞进行了非法的秘密审讯。一队队前往抗议的工人、学生和同胞从上午九时半开始涌到“裁判署”，他们高声朗读毛主席语录，大唱革命歌曲，并且张贴大字报。港英当局对这些手无寸铁的抗议队伍怕得要死，立即调动大批“防暴队”前往镇压。这些法西斯暴徒向群众发射了二十多发催泪弹以后，便扑上去疯狂地毒打我同胞，他们朝着同胞的头部、胸腹部和下体等要害地方猛插猛击，连许多老人和妇女、儿童都不放过，当场有几个同胞重伤昏倒。满地的鲜血，成了对帝国主义“法庭”的血的控诉。
    爱国同胞们在被敌人疯狂毒打的时候，坚贞不屈，斗志昂扬，始终手挽手，用激昂的声调朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”高呼“毛主席万岁！”并且怒斥法西斯暴徒。他们遵照毛主席的教导，互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助，前边的同胞倒下去，后面的立即跟上来。警棍飞向老弱同胞的时候，旁边的同胞立即用自己的身体去抵挡。他们不惧怕敌人的藤牌、警棍，坚持把重伤的同胞救出去。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”
    在法西斯暴徒血洗花园道口，毒打和逮捕一百多位代表以后，立刻就有更多的同胞高举着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，胸前挂着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，高呼口号，大唱革命歌曲，迎着敌人的枪口，冲破敌人的封锁，奔向港英“总督府”抗议。
    同胞们万众一心，同仇敌忾，在街头举行了声势浩大的示威游行。“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“血债血偿！”“坚决把反迫害斗争进行到底！”“港英必败！我们必胜！”口号声震撼着整个香港的上空。示威群众的英勇行动受到沿途工人、学生和居民以及外资商行的中国职员的热烈赞扬和支持。他们高呼：“胜利！胜利！”很多同胞当场加入游行队伍，愤怒抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行。沿途有的人送茶送水慰问。交通工人把汽车开到路中心阻挡警车通行，保护示威游行的同胞。
    敌人最害怕毛泽东思想，最害怕大字报这个新式武器，我们的同胞就偏要把毛主席语录纸和大字报贴满“总督府”和许多港英机构，贴满全港九。同胞们还用红色和白色的油漆在这些建筑物上和街道上涂写大字标语。
    香港电车工人十二时三十分举行了停车抗议。九龙和香港的公共汽车工人也从十二时半开始停驶一小时，表示强烈的抗议。在九龙尖沙咀总站，正当工人们雄赳赳地列队站在车前高呼口号、大唱革命歌曲的时候，港英当局竟出动警察妄图镇压。一名英勇的公共汽车司机驾着汽车对准法西斯暴徒冲过去，吓得这班暴徒慌忙后退，胡乱向工人射出十几枚催泪弹和木弹。无比愤怒的公共汽车工人利用公共汽车掩护，纷纷拾起石块、玻璃瓶，准备回击敌人。在工人的巨大声威面前，吓破了胆的法西斯暴徒不敢前进一步。
    为了策划进一步的迫害行动，港英当局宣布从二十二日下午六时半开始，在港岛市区实施全面的宵禁（戒严）。在宵禁期内，港英警察和特务继续逮捕我同胞，遭到我同胞的英勇还击。同胞们在屋顶和房子里纷纷把石块和玻璃瓶投向港英法西斯暴徒，吓得这些暴徒东躲西藏。
    港英当局对中国同胞的法西斯镇压已大大地升级，港九中国同胞的反迫害斗争也正在跟着升级。
