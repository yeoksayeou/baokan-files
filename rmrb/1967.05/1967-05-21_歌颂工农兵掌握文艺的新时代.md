Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," pointed out: "Our literature and art are for the masses of the people, and first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for them to use." Chairman Mao foresaw long ago that a new era in which the workers, peasants, and soldiers themselves master the arts was inevitably coming. Today, the workers, peasants, and soldiers have become the masters of the arts, and the arts have become a powerful weapon in their hands. Chairman Mao's wise foresight is being realized!

In a society under the dictatorship of the proletariat, literature and art, as a necessary and important front in the revolutionary struggle, are crucial in determining who they serve and who controls them. If the proletariat does not occupy this front, the bourgeoisie will. Therefore, the intense class struggle on the literary and artistic front has never ceased. For a period, under the direction of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the anti-party, anti-socialist black line of literature and art led by Zhou Yang monopolized our literary and artistic circles. They relentlessly used anti-party, anti-socialist poisonous weeds to corrupt the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and tried to turn literature and art into a tool for restoring capitalism. It is at this critical moment that Chairman Mao, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, issued the great call to "never forget class struggle." The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers immediately responded and launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This greatly promoted ideological revolutionization, enhanced the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and strengthened the fighting spirit. Since 1964, the extensive mass activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the literary and artistic front have brought about a new situation. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, full of revolutionary enthusiasm, bravely entered the literary and artistic arena amidst the jeers and curses of domestic and foreign class enemies. They wrote new poems, performed new plays, sang new songs, danced new dances, painted new paintings, and most enthusiastically sang the praises of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, of our great leader Chairman Mao, of the great victories of our country's socialist revolution, of the great leaps forward on all fronts of socialist construction, and of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They fully demonstrated the mighty power of this new literary and artistic army. Especially the large number of poems published by workers, peasants, and soldiers on wall newspapers and blackboards, both in content and form, marked a completely new era.

In the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the literary and artistic movement of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and the revolutionary young people has entered a new stage. They took up their pens as weapons, and wherever the red flag is raised, drums beat. They pointed out the mountains and rivers, and wrote passionately, directing their struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Their works, with "criticism" at the forefront, are full of revolutionary rebellious spirit and clear class hatred. Their performances, with workers, peasants, and soldiers on stage and a strong atmosphere of struggle, deeply entered the squares, streets, fields, trenches, and workshops to perform, quickly spreading Chairman Mao's voice to their class brothers, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie. "The revolutionary masses must shout loudly on the revolutionary political stage and also sing and dance loudly on the revolutionary artistic stage." Look, as the masters of politics and art, how proud the workers, peasants, and soldiers are!

The workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the arts have broken the long-term monopoly of the bourgeoisie over the arts, thoroughly changed the position of workers, peasants, and soldiers who have been without rights in the arts for thousands of years, and turned the arts into a powerful weapon in their own hands.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the arts can ensure the launch of a large-scale mass movement to criticize the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, further consolidate our country's proletarian dictatorship, and create favorable conditions for gradually narrowing and eliminating the three great differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the arts can best combine their rich revolutionary practice with their personal experiences, reflect the magnificent picture of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and reflect the revolutionary demeanor of the heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers on various fronts, fundamentally change the face of our country's arts, and create a brilliant socialist new art.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the arts will forge a vast army of artists armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They will never leave the masses, never leave labor, never leave the struggle, and possess boundless vitality, which no force can break.

The rise of the new army of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the arts has set an example for artists to learn from. Revolutionary artists must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, organize and plan to go to the countryside, factories, and units, and immerse themselves in the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. They must humbly learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, sincerely learn their firm revolutionary stance, their thoughts, feelings, and language, and learn how they use the arts as a powerful weapon to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. The struggle to criticize and reform the arts can only be combined with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers' artistic criticism to thoroughly uproot the anti-revolutionary revisionist black line of literature and art, and establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

The workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the arts have marked a completely new era. Let us raise our hands and warmly welcome the era of the workers, peasants, and soldiers mastering the arts!

    歌颂工农兵掌握文艺的新时代
    本报评论员
    我们伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”毛主席早就预见到一个工农兵自己掌握文艺的新时代不可避免地将要到来。今天，工农兵做了文艺的主人，文艺已经成为工农兵手中强大的武器，毛主席英明的预见正在实现！
    在无产阶级专政的社会里，作为革命总战线中一条必要和重要战线的文学艺术，为什么人服务和掌握在什么人手里，是关系到革命兴衰成败的一件大事。这条战线无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就要占领。因此，在文艺战线上严重的阶级斗争从来没有停止过。一个时期，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的主使下，以周扬为首的反革命修正主义文艺黑线专了我们文艺界的政。他们拚命地用反党反社会主义的毒草腐蚀工农兵群众，极力把文艺作为复辟资本主义的舆论工具。正是在这个关键时刻，毛主席在八届十中全会上发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。广大工农兵群众立即响应，并掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，极大地促进了思想革命化，提高了明辨是非的能力，增强了战斗的信心。一九六四年以来，工农兵在文艺战线上的广泛的群众活动，使文艺战线出现了新的气象。广大工农兵满怀革命豪情，在国内外阶级敌人的讥笑和咒骂声中，挥笔上阵，勇敢地闯进文艺大门，对准文艺黑线猛烈开火。他们写新诗，演新戏，唱新歌，跳新舞，画新画，最最热情地歌颂战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂伟大领袖毛主席，歌颂我国社会主义革命的伟大胜利，歌颂社会主义建设各个战线上的大跃进，歌颂工农兵英雄人物，充分显示出这支文艺新军的雄壮军威。特别是工农兵发表在墙报、黑板报上的大量诗歌，无论内容和形式都划出了一个完全崭新的时代。
    在轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，工农兵群众和革命小将的文艺运动又进入一个新的阶段。他们拿起笔来做刀枪，红旗举处锣鼓响，指点江山，激扬文字，把斗争矛头对准了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们的作品，破字当头，充满革命造反精神，阶级爱憎最分明。他们的演出，满台工农兵，满台火药味。有着强烈的战斗气氛。他们深入到广场、街头、田间、战壕、车间演出，把毛主席的声音很快传给自己的阶级弟兄，大长无产阶级志气，大灭资产阶级威风。“无产阶级革命派要在革命的政治舞台上大喊大叫，也要在革命的文艺舞台上大唱大跳。”请看，做了政治和文艺主人的工农兵，是何等的自豪！
    工农兵掌握文艺，打破了资产阶级对于文艺的长期垄断，彻底改变了工农兵几千年来在文艺上无权的地位，使文艺成为自己手中强有力的战斗武器。
    工农兵掌握文艺，就能保证在意识形态领域里开展大规模的批判资产阶级的群众运动，大立毛泽东思想，进一步巩固我国无产阶级专政，为逐步缩小和消灭城乡、工农、脑力劳动和体力劳动三大差别创造有利的条件。
    工农兵掌握文艺，最能够结合自己亲身经历的丰富革命实践，反映出阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三项伟大革命运动的壮丽图景，反映出活跃在各条战线上的工农兵英雄人物的革命风貌，从根本上改变我国文艺的面貌，创造出灿烂辉煌的社会主义新文艺。
    工农兵掌握文艺，就会锻炼出一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、浩浩荡荡的文艺队伍。他们一刻也不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，不脱离斗争，具有无限的生命力，是任何力量也打不破的。
    工农兵文艺新军的兴起，为文艺工作者树立了学习的榜样。革命的文艺工作者们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，有组织有计划地下乡、下厂、下连队，投身到广大的工农兵群众中去，恭恭敬敬地拜工农兵为师，老老实实地向工农兵学习。学习他们坚定的革命立场，学习他们的思想、感情和语言，学习他们怎样把文艺做为宣传毛泽东思想的有力武器。文艺界的斗批改也只有同广大工农兵的文艺批判相结合，才能彻底铲除反革命修正主义文艺黑线，树立起毛主席革命文艺路线的绝对权威。
    工农兵掌握文艺，划出了一个完全崭新的时代。让我们举起双手，热烈欢呼工农兵掌握文艺的时代的到来！
