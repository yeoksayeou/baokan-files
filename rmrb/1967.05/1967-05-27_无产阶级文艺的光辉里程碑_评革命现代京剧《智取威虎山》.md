In the midst of the thunderous battle cry against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and on the day when the revolutionary masses most fervently commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" was once again performed in the capital. This is a heavy blow to the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and a great victory for Chairman Mao's "Talks."

Twenty-five years ago, Chairman Mao, in his "Talks," proposed the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, clearly pointing out: "Our literature and art are for the people. They are first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers; they are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for their use." Two years later, he issued the great call to revolutionize the theater and turn the inverted history back over in his letter to the Yan'an People's Theater after watching "Forced to Rebel." Yet, for a long time, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, together with a small clique of counterrevolutionary revisionists like Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Zhou Yang, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on literature and art, stubbornly pushing a counterrevolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art. They turned the stage into a bastion for the restoration of capitalism, allowing emperors, generals, and ghosts and monsters to dominate the stage, while the workers, peasants, and soldiers were suppressed. Can we tolerate this situation to continue? No, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no! To tolerate this situation is to tolerate the restoration of capitalism, to tolerate the peaceful evolution of the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and to tolerate the change of color of our socialist state. Under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, Comrade Jiang Qing raised high the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, leading revolutionary literary and art workers to launch a fierce and tenacious attack on Peking opera, the most stubborn bastion of feudalism and capitalism. This marked the beginning of the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country and the vanguard battle of the cultural revolution. The Peking opera revolution, with its irresistible momentum, swept away emperors, generals, and ghosts and monsters, and for the first time planted the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the Peking opera stage, making the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers the masters of the stage, and truly implementing the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The power struggle on the stage of art is an important aspect of the power struggle on the political stage. The Peking opera revolution is the beginning and an important part of the great proletarian cultural revolution. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is one of the brilliant achievements of this great revolution. In this opera, everything is fresh and new, with the distinct characteristics of the great era of Mao Zedong: the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat shines brightly, piercing the heavens; the heroic figures of the proletarian revolution, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, stand tall and radiant; and the Peking opera art, reformed and reborn, is full of revolutionary fighting spirit. This is a great art born of a great era. Its appearance, along with other revolutionary model operas like "The Red Lantern," "The Red Detachment of Women," "Shajiabang," "On the Docks," "The Red Guard on Honghu Lake," and "The White-Haired Girl," as well as the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and the symphony "Shajiabang," sounded the death knell for capitalist, feudal, and revisionist literature and art, and opened a new era for proletarian revolutionary literature and art and revolutionary culture.

I

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad." The most outstanding achievement of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" lies in its enthusiastic praise for Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war and people's army, fully demonstrating the revolutionary road of our people, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, to victory through armed struggle, and deeply revealing the Marxist truth that only through armed struggle can political power be seized and consolidated.

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" depicts a side of the great Chinese People's Liberation War: a campaign by our army to suppress bandits on the Northeast battlefield in 1946. At that time, the U.S. and the Kuomintang were colluding, playing political tricks of fake talks and real battles. The overall situation on the Northeast battlefield was still one of enemy strength and our weakness. Under such circumstances, Chairman Mao timely issued the great directive to "establish a solid base in the Northeast." Comrade Lin Biao resolutely carried out and implemented Chairman Mao's directive, quickly achieving victory on the Northeast battlefield and laying the foundation for the liberation of the whole country. Under the personal guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, the fundamental spirit of Chairman Mao's directive and his military thoughts are vividly reflected throughout the entire opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," becoming its soul. The opera places the campaign by the pursuit team led by Xiao Jianbo to suppress bandits against the political background of "U.S.-KMT collusion, fake talks, real battles," portraying the bandit gang led by Zuo Daotai as political bandits colluding with the U.S. and the KMT and committing all sorts of evil deeds, while also depicting the people suffering in deep water and fire, eagerly yearning for liberation. In this way, the opera reveals that our army's campaign to suppress bandits represents the interests of the people and will inevitably receive the full support of the people. Therefore, the campaign to suppress bandits becomes an important link in mobilizing the masses and establishing a solid base in the Northeast, which has important strategic significance for the Northeast battlefield and the liberation of the whole country. The entire opera closely combines the arduous and heroic struggle of the pursuit team with their meticulous, solid, and down-to-earth political and mass work, correctly handling the relationship between the regular army and the militia, armed masses, and non-armed masses, thereby greatly enhancing the ideological content of the opera. The opera angrily denounces the brutality of the enemy but does not exaggerate the "terror" of war; instead, it highlights the justice of the people's revolutionary war and the spirit of resistance of the masses. The opera also writes about the hardships of the revolutionary struggle but does not exaggerate the "suffering" of war; instead, it enthusiastically praises the revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism of the people's army and the masses. Those who have seen "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" cannot help but be deeply moved by the scenes "Deep Mountain Inquiry" and "Mobilizing the Masses," directed and designed by Comrade Jiang Qing. The angry denunciation by the hunter Lao Chang and his daughter, the brave struggle of the railway worker Li Yongqi and the people of Jia Pikou, deeply express the fiery hatred of millions of laboring people towards their class enemies, their boundless love for the Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Liberation Army, and their strong desire to arm themselves and use armed struggle to eliminate the enemy and liberate themselves. These two scenes also vividly depict the process of the people's children bringing deep class feelings to mobilize and organize the masses. The entire opera is filled with abundant revolutionary passion, praising the greatness of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao, and praising the intimate relationship between the army and the people. The development of the plot convincingly shows that it is precisely based on Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war and the iron wall of revolutionary masses that the pursuit team was able to achieve victory with ingenuity and outnumber the enemy. Chairman Mao said, "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." "Around the revolutionary government, we must rally tens of millions of people to develop our revolutionary war. We can then annihilate all counterrevolutionaries and seize all of China." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" powerfully demonstrates this great truth with its immense artistic force.

People's revolutionary war is the fundamental path for the proletariat to struggle for liberation and seize political power. Comrade Lin Biao said: "Dare or not to wage people's war is the question of daring or not to make a revolution." Therefore, the attitude towards people's revolutionary war is a dividing line between Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and revisionism. The struggle on this issue is also reflected in the field of literature and art. Should literature and art praise and depict people's revolutionary war? How should people's revolutionary war be depicted? This is a focal point of the struggle between two classes and two lines in the field of literature and art. Revisionists are extremely hostile to people's revolutionary war. They are terrified of the great truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The head of the literary and art black line, Xia Yan, did not personally take to the stage, shouting to "deviate from the orthodox path"? They want to deviate from the "orthodox path" of Mao Zedong Thought and rebel against the "path" of people's revolutionary war. Whether in China or abroad, revisionists, in their so-called "war literature," are uniformly erasing the distinction between just and unjust wars, desperately propagating the "terror" and "suffering" of war. They dig up so-called "humanity" from the fascist army, praising their "bravery" and "tenacity"; while in the revolutionary people and revolutionary army, they look for "dark sides," fabricating their "weakness" and "vacillation." In a word, they want to slander and defame revolutionary people and revolutionary war, realizing their political conspiracy to negate revolutionary war and thus negate the revolution. Reactionary films like "The Fate of a Man," "The 41st," "Red Sun," and "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" are typical examples of revisionist literature and art. The Peking opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is good precisely because it goes against the path of revisionist literature and art, fully depicting the "orthodox path" of Mao Zedong Thought, and enthusiastically praising the "path" of people's revolutionary war. It not only sets a brilliant example for Peking opera art but also for the entire revolutionary literature and art to correctly depict people's revolutionary war.

II

The other outstanding achievement of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is its full portrayal of proletarian revolutionary warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and through them, it expresses Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people."

Should we create images of proletarian revolutionary heroes? What should be the main focus in creating heroic images? This has long been a focal point of the struggle between the two lines in the literary and art field. Not writing about heroic figures but only about mediocre ones; or superficially writing about heroic figures but actually smuggling in bourgeois or petty-bourgeois goods, blackening the faces of heroic figures, is a trick often used by revisionists. In the creation of the image of Yang Zirong, there was a fierce struggle. Among the scriptwriters and directors, there were different opinions. A prominent issue was: should Yang Zirong be written as a "lone hero" or a "collective hero"? The so-called "lone hero" is to not highlight politics and not highlight Mao Zedong Thought, using a purely military perspective to depict the heroic image, as if the hero becomes a hero because of extraordinary abilities, special talents, etc. Originally, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" had many strange plots and thrilling scenes, isolating Yang Zirong's "wisdom" and "bravery," resulting in not only unbelievable plots but also seriously damaging the ideological realm of the heroic figure. Practice has proven that this path is wrong. Comrade Jiang Qing timely corrected this deviation, emphasizing that Yang Zirong must be portrayed as a "collective hero." Yang Zirong's "courage" is revolutionary courage; his "wisdom" and "bravery" are revolutionary great wisdom and great bravery. This revolutionary courage and great wisdom and bravery come from the great Mao Zedong Thought, from his high class consciousness and unlimited loyalty to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and from the strong fighting collective of the pursuit team and the full support of millions of class brothers. The image of Yang Zirong, created according to Comrade Jiang Qing's opinion, is a towering figure radiating the dazzling light of Mao Zedong Thought. In the eyes of the bandits, he is a skilled "hero," and in the hearts of the audience, he is a proletarian revolutionary hero. The scene "Deep Mountain Inquiry" writes about Yang Zirong's fiery class feelings and his investigative abilities coming from the flesh-and-blood connection with the people's army and the people. The scene "Planning" further writes about the deep class roots and ideological foundation of his great wisdom and great bravery. Yang Zirong has four conditions for going up the mountain, the most important of which is "the loyal heart of a revolutionary soldier to the Party and the people," "a heart like a flame, turning into a sword to slay the stubborn." Yang Zirong, with the "collective courage" of millions of class brothers, with the magnificent ideal of "the red flag flying over the five continents and four seas," and with the noble qualities of a revolutionary soldier who fears neither hardship nor death and is dedicated to the revolution and the people, infiltrates the bandit den. Precisely because of this, he can, at the critical moment, first spiritually overwhelm Lan Ping, seize the enemy's contradictions and weaknesses, and defeat the enemy, achieving the final victory in the struggle. Yang Zirong's heroic line, "Resisting the cold and turning ice and snow into sunshine in my heart," reveals the source of his great wisdom and great bravery, the power of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in an ordinary revolutionary soldier.

The creation of this artistic image of Yang Zirong provides an excellent example for literary creation, convincingly showing that to establish a towering revolutionary heroic image on the stage of art, the most fundamental thing is to write about his sublime spiritual realm, that is, to write about how he uses Mao Zedong Thought to arm himself and guide his revolutionary actions. The more Mao Zedong Thought there is, the higher the revolutionary heroic image will be. Without Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary heroic image will be like a tree without roots and water without a source, not only impossible to have life and luster but bound to go astray.

The image of Xiao Jianbo is equally brilliant. As a commander armed with Mao Zedong Thought, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" focuses on how he correctly implements Chairman Mao's political and military lines, achieves the Party's absolute leadership over the army, and conducts patient and meticulous political and ideological work and mass work. As a commander, he has a comprehensive view, far-sighted plans, decisive actions, and calm command. All of this, however, is not because he is a born Zhuge Liang, skilled in divination, but because he can follow Chairman Mao's directives closely, deeply enter the grassroots, listen to the opinions of soldiers and the masses with humility, conduct thorough investigations and research, and thus make correct judgments about complex situations and propose complete and practical battle plans. In the opera, his relationship with Yang Zirong is arranged appropriately. His actions neither weaken Yang Zirong's image nor fully play the role that a correct and powerful leader should have. On key issues, he guides Yang Zirong, but also lets Yang Zirong think, act, and do. In this way, the two heroic images complement each other, enhancing each other's brilliance.

While vigorously creating the image of the people's army, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" also strengthens the creation of the image of the people, especially the creation of Li Yongqi, a representative of millions of people who sincerely support the revolution. This image in the opera is not used as a decoration or embellishment but as an important aspect of embodying Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war, placed in a very prominent position. Li Yongqi, suffering from national oppression and class oppression, is deeply resentful and has not the slightest trace of servility. He is clear in his hatred and love, with a stubborn spirit like a blazing fire, hating to burn the entire old world and all demons to ashes. This is the most precious character of the Chinese laboring people. Revisionists are trying every means to erase this revolutionary character, while revolutionary literary and art workers must sing its praises and generalize and typify it. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" does exactly this. It writes about Li Yongqi's stubbornness, which is his deep hatred and enmity towards class enemies, and his strong spirit of resistance. Of course, the script does not write Li Yongqi as a born class-conscious warrior but reasonably writes about his ideological growth and changes under the Party's education. The image of Li Yongqi powerfully reveals the boundless revolutionary potential hidden in the Chinese laboring people, making us deeply feel the great truth that "the most profound source of the mighty power of war lies among the people."

What class rules the stage of art is an important sign to distinguish different class literatures and arts. "You are a bourgeois literary and art worker, you praise the bourgeoisie but not the proletariat; you are a proletarian literary and art worker, you praise the proletariat and the laboring people but not the bourgeoisie: one of the two must be chosen." Peking opera, like all old arts, has always been dominated by figures of the exploiting class. The Peking opera revolution is to turn this historical inversion back over, to establish the image of proletarian revolutionary heroes and make them the permanent masters of the stage. This is the key to the proletariat seizing the leadership of the Peking opera stage and the key to seizing all literary and art positions. Under the direct guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, in the process of refining and improving "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," a clear creative idea was established: everything should serve to establish the heroic image of positive characters on the stage. Whether it is the handling of music, stage art, or the handling of negative characters, it must all serve the above central task. In the past, there was a prevailing view that the more arrogant the negative characters are, the more they can highlight the greatness of the positive characters. This is utterly absurd. The two opposing sides always have one side that is dominant and overwhelming. Emphasizing negative characters will inevitably weaken and even distort positive characters. Originally, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" depicted Zuo Daotai using the methods of standing on both sides, opening the mountain, appointing generals, and sitting in the hall to exaggerate his counterrevolutionary style and momentum, accompanied by strong musical effects. As a result, the negative characters were very arrogant, while Yang Zirong and other positive characters were dry and could not stand up. Comrade Jiang Qing pointed out sharply after discovering this that this is a matter of stance and class feelings. She personally led the redesign, focusing on exposing the "paper tiger" nature of the negative characters in their dying struggle and desperate situation. In the scene "Wuhu Hall," she let Zuo Daotai sit to the side from the beginning and weakened the musical effects; she deleted the four negative characters, Dinghe Daoshi and others, to make more room to concentrate on depicting the three main heroic images. To highlight the heroic images, the opera uses various artistic means, especially musical means, and conducts a series of innovations and reforms in artistic form: it arranges a set of arias for heroic figures, breaking the old conventions and old roles in terms of tunes and melodies, boldly drawing new fighting melodies from modern revolutionary music; the prelude, ending, and many important plots of the entire opera are all based on the tune of "The March of the People's Liberation Army of China," which powerfully sets off the spiritual appearance of proletarian revolutionary heroes; such as starting from life, designing new and wonderful dance scenes like marching in the snow, skiing, and fighting, more vividly showing the heroic spirit of the people's army, brave and unyielding, invincible, etc. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is thus fully utilizing literary, musical, and dance artistic means, successfully creating the new heroic images that have never appeared in the history of drama, truly implementing the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao's "Talks" on the Peking opera stage, and successfully making proletarian revolutionary heroes the masters of the Peking opera stage.

Seizing the leadership of the Peking opera stage is a life-and-death class struggle. Ultimately, it is a political struggle of restoration and anti-restoration, seizure of power and anti-seizure of power. "The proletariat wants to change the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its worldview." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" grew up in the struggle between the two lines. Its growth process experienced a sharp and tortuous class struggle, serving as a microcosm of the Peking opera revolution.

Should Peking opera perform revolutionary modern plays? This was the first battle that "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" encountered. In 1958, on the basis of the victory of the socialist transformation in the ownership system and the anti-rightist struggle in our country, a great leap forward that shook the world appeared on the vast land of the motherland. "All decayed ideologies and other unsuitable parts of the superstructure are crumbling day by day."

In such a good revolutionary situation, "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and other revolutionary modern plays, like young sprouts, broke through the heavy shackles of feudalism and capitalism, and began to bud on the Peking opera stage. Although they were not perfect at the time and had various defects, they were new things. They aimed to change the situation where Peking opera only performed emperors and generals, making Peking opera serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This general direction was completely correct. However, the heirs of emperors and generals—the small clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie—were in a state of panic, fearing the loss of the Peking opera stage and the extinction of the exploiting class. With the support of the behind-the-scenes boss, the Chinese Khrushchev, they fiercely suppressed the new thing of Peking opera modern plays, shouting things like "Peking opera cannot perform modern plays" and "it's sheer nonsense." They used cold ridicule, hot sarcasm, open attacks, and covert arrows. They even used their stolen authority to ban "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" to the cold palace, only occasionally performing it a few times during festivals to put on a show. This young sprout of the Peking opera revolution was almost strangled. During this period, they even ordered the troupe performing "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" to perform poisonous weeds like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "The Four Generals," and "The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants." On the Peking opera stage, a counterrevolutionary counterattack, settlement of scores, and restoration were carried out.

"Even when the cliff is a hundred feet high, there are still flowers blooming." Just when the ghosts and monsters ruled the stage, Comrade Jiang Qing raised high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, discovered this young sprout of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and believed that with careful cultivation, it would definitely grow into a towering tree. Starting in April 1964, Comrade Jiang Qing personally initiated and led the major revision of this play. Based on Chairman Mao's thoughts on literature and art and the direction indicated by the "Talks," Comrade Jiang Qing proposed a series of important opinions, not only giving "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" new life but also making significant contributions to the Peking opera revolution and the entire socialist literature and art.

However, the representatives of the bourgeoisie fiercely resisted, strongly opposing the Peking opera revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing. They used two tricks: one was to deny the achievements of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," trying to strangle it with the insults of "plain water" and "spoken drama with singing"; the other was to try to lead it onto the path of serving bourgeois politics. Their vicious attacks on "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" were particularly concentrated on the issue of establishing revolutionary heroic figures. In 1964, during the modern Peking opera observation and performance in Beijing, their crazy attacks reached a climax. The counterrevolutionary revisionist Lin Mohan directly instructed others to write articles attacking this play, saying that emphasizing Yang Zirong's revolutionary spirit would make his character "restrained and depressed"; advocating to emphasize Yang Zirong's "bold, rough, and wild" nature, that is, the so-called "gangster spirit" and "bandit spirit," and exaggerating the arrogance of Zuo Daotai, Lan Ping, and Yizhu Mao and other bandits. Yang Zirong in this play is portrayed as a representative figure of the people's army. Lin Mohan and his like want to blacken this heroic figure, forcibly imposing "gangster spirit" and "bandit spirit" on him. Isn't this defaming our entire people's army? They want to weaken and strangle Yang Zirong's revolutionary spirit. Isn't this opposing Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of our people's army?

It is precisely so. "There is no love without reason, nor hatred without reason." Lin Mohan and his like attacking "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is not just to slander a play but has a greater political background. We know that in 1946, there were two opposing military lines on the Northeast battlefield: one was the revolutionary line firmly implemented by Comrade Lin Biao, and the other was the capitulationist line pushed by the counterrevolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen, who was then working in the Northeast (this military line had brought great losses to the Northeast battlefield). The victory on the Northeast battlefield was the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" praises Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. How could it not provoke the fear and hatred of the proposers and implementers of the capitulationist line? Lin Mohan, as a watchdog of the Chinese Khrushchev, jumped out to bark at "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," fully embodying his master's limitless fear and deep hatred of Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. This shows that: the struggle between the two literary and art lines on the Peking opera stage centered around "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" is a reflection of the struggle between two classes, two political lines, and two military lines on the political stage.

Comrade Jiang Qing firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, raised high the banner of the proletarian revolution, and led this struggle. In her speech at the symposium of modern Peking opera observation and performance personnel in July 1964, she fully affirmed the achievements of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and in response to the attackers' fallacies, sharply pointed out: "You have to consider whose side you are on? Are you on the side of the positive characters or the negative characters?" This debate ended with the enemy's defeat. Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao personally watched "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," which is the greatest concern, encouragement, and support for the Peking opera revolution.

After "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" achieved great success, should it be refined and improved, and continue to advance? In which direction should it advance? This is a big question about whether the proletariat can consolidate the positions it has seized in the field of literature and art, and whether this revolution can be carried out to the end.

After the reporting performance, in April 1965, Comrade Jiang Qing went to Shanghai again, leading the refinement and improvement of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy." With the revolutionary spirit of a proletarian politician, Comrade Jiang Qing, starting from the political interests of the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world, made strategic considerations for the Peking opera revolution. She pointed out: all art, if not serving the bourgeoisie, serves the proletariat. Peking opera was originally performed by emperors and generals, serving feudalism and capitalism. It is not possible to serve the proletariat without change. To reform, one must have revolutionary people, people who can break through difficulties. We must walk our own path, and our art must have an impact in the world. We must have great ambitions and think for the people of the whole country, think for the people of the world who are still oppressed. She required the creators and performers to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, deeply enter the army to learn from the PLA, and realize ideological revolutionization. She required, with "revolutionary tenacity," to strive for perfection, refining and improving "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" into a revolutionary model opera; she scientifically analyzed this play, from the literary script, musical image, directing, performance to stage art, and studied with everyone, proposing a complete, profound, and effective revision plan. She required the unification of revolutionary political content and perfect artistic form, making the heroic figures armed with Mao Zedong Thought even more towering, and using Mao Zedong Thought to educate the broad masses of the audience.

Refining "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" into a revolutionary model opera is to seize the leadership of the proletariat in the ideological realm, permanently drive out all ghosts and monsters from the stage, and thoroughly smash the dream of counterrevolutionary restoration of the exploiting class. For this reason, a small clique of capitalist-roaders in the Party and reactionary "authority" lords sensed that their end was near and struggled desperately. They regarded this play as a thorn in the eye and a splinter in the flesh. They set up obstacles, created disputes, spread doubts, and even dared to ignore the opinions of our great leader Chairman Mao, trying to sabotage the refinement and improvement of this play. The "Southern Tyrant" of the Peking opera world, Zhou Xinfan, cursed "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" as "not like Peking opera," "Peking opera still needs its own rules!" and slandered the refinement of model operas as "exhausting the people and wasting resources." This is how they hated revolutionary modern plays!

"The ant shaking the tree is an easy task." "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" broke through numerous obstacles, repelled the sabotage of ghosts and monsters, and together with other excellent revolutionary model operas, became an artistic gem shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, opening up a brilliant path for the Peking opera revolution and writing an epoch-making page in the history of world revolutionary art.

The growth process of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" shows: after the proletariat seized political power and carried out changes in the ownership system, the bourgeoisie and their representatives in the Party will tenaciously express their political demands in the field of literature and art and other ideological realms, always stubbornly using the various ideological and cultural positions they occupy to create public opinion for their counterrevolutionary restoration and counterrevolutionary coup d'état. We carry out the Peking opera revolution, carry out the proletarian cultural revolution, ultimately to protect the socialist economic base, safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensure that our socialist state will never change color.

The appearance of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" also shows: as long as we raise high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, the stubborn bastion of Peking opera can be broken through, and all old bastions can be broken through. Imperialism and modern revisionism slander us for "destroying culture." For capitalist and feudal decayed culture, we must destroy it thoroughly. Not destroying means not building, not blocking means not flowing. Only by cleansing the muddy water of capitalism and feudalism can we create the newest and most beautiful proletarian new culture. One flower blooms, reporting the arrival of spring to the world. "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," as the brightest flower in the Peking opera revolution, announces to the world that the spring of the hundred flowers of proletarian revolutionary literature and art has arrived! If we compare the artistic models created by the proletariat to a luxuriant tree, then the so-called "high peaks" of art cultivated by the landlord class and the bourgeoisie for thousands of years can at most be a withered grass swaying in the west wind. In comparison, it is how small!

"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" has achieved great success, but for the proletariat, this is only the first step of a ten-thousand-mile journey. A longer journey awaits us; higher mountains await us to climb. Let us follow the direction indicated by our great leader Chairman Mao for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, learn from Comrade Jiang Qing's revolutionary spirit, break through difficulties, overcome all obstacles, and strive for new victories!

    无产阶级文艺的光辉里程碑
    评革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》
    丁学雷
    在向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击的战鼓声中，在无产阶级革命派以最最热烈的心情纪念我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的日子里，革命现代京剧《智取威虎山》在首都再度上演了。这是对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的沉重打击，是毛主席《讲话》的伟大胜利。
    二十五年前，毛主席在《讲话》中提出了文艺为工农兵服务的方向，明确指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”两年以后，他老人家在《看了〈逼上梁山〉以后写给延安平剧院的信》中，又发出了进行戏剧革命，把颠倒的历史再颠倒过来的伟大号召。可是，长期以来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派纠集彭真、陆定一、周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子，疯狂地对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线。他们把艺术舞台，变成复辟资本主义的阵地，让帝王将相、牛鬼蛇神专工农兵的政。我们能够容忍这种状况继续下去吗？不能，一千个不能，一万个不能！容忍这种情况，就是容忍资本主义复辟，容忍无产阶级专政“和平演变”为资产阶级专政，容忍我们的社会主义江山改变颜色。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，江青同志高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，率领革命文艺工作者，首先向京剧这个封建主义和资本主义的最顽固的堡垒展开英勇顽强的进攻，掀起了震动世界的京剧革命，打响了我国无产阶级文化大革命的前哨战。京剧革命以锐不可当之势，横扫帝王将相、牛鬼蛇神，在京剧舞台上第一次插上了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，使工农兵的英雄人物成为京剧舞台的主人，使文艺为工农兵服务的方向得到了真正的贯彻。艺术舞台上进行的这场惊心动魄的夺权斗争，是政治舞台上的夺权斗争的一个重要方面。京剧革命正是无产阶级文化大革命的开端和重要组成部分。《智取威虎山》就是这一伟大革命的辉煌战果之一。在这个戏里，一切都是崭新的，具有伟大的毛泽东时代的鲜明特色：无产阶级的彻底革命精神光焰四射，气贯长虹；用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命英雄形象昂然挺立，光彩照人；经过改造而得到新生的京剧艺术饱含着革命的战斗的艺术感染力量。这是伟大的时代必然要产生的伟大艺术。它和其他京剧革命现代戏《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》，以及革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》、交响音乐《沙家浜》等优秀样板戏的出现，敲响了资本主义、封建主义和修正主义文艺的丧钟，开创了无产阶级革命文艺和革命文化的新纪元。

    毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”《智取威虎山》最突出的成就首先在于：它热情地歌颂了毛主席的人民战争、人民军队的伟大思想，充分表现了我国人民在党和毛主席领导下，通过武装斗争夺取全国胜利的革命道路，深刻揭示了只有通过武装斗争才能夺取政权、巩固政权的马克思主义真理。
    《智取威虎山》描写的是伟大的中国人民解放战争的一个侧面：一九四六年东北战场上我军一支剿匪队伍的一次剿匪斗争。当时美蒋勾结，玩弄假谈真打的政治阴谋，东北战场总的形势，还是敌强我弱。在这种形势下，毛主席及时作出“建立巩固的东北根据地”的伟大指示。林彪同志坚决贯彻和实现了毛主席的指示，使东北战场很快地取得了胜利，为全国解放奠定了胜利的基础。在江青同志的亲自指导下，毛主席这一指示的根本精神，毛主席的军事思想，鲜明地贯串于《智取威虎山》全剧之中，成为它的灵魂。剧中把以少剑波为首的追剿队的剿匪斗争，突出地放在“美蒋勾结，假谈真打”的政治背景上，把座山雕匪帮刻划为与美蒋勾结、无恶不作的政治土匪，同时表现了人民处于水深火热之中，渴望解放的强烈愿望。这样，就揭示出我军消灭土匪的革命战争，代表了人民的利益，必然得到人民的全力支持。因此，剿匪斗争就成为发动群众、建立巩固的东北根据地的重要环节，这对东北战场和全国解放都有着重要的战略意义。全剧把追剿队的艰苦卓绝的英勇斗争同他们的深入细致、扎扎实实的政治工作和群众工作紧紧结合在一起，正确处理了正规军与民兵、武装群众和非武装群众的关系，这就大大地提高了这个戏的思想性。戏里对敌人的残暴进行了愤怒的控诉，但绝没有去渲染什么战争的“恐怖”，而是突出了人民革命战争的正义性和人民群众的反抗精神；戏里也写了革命斗争的艰苦性，但绝没有去渲染什么战争的“苦难”，而是满腔热情地歌颂了人民军队和人民群众的革命英雄主义和革命乐观主义。看过《智取威虎山》的人，无不为江青同志亲自指导设计的“深山问苦”和“发动群众”这两场戏深深激动。猎户老常父女的愤怒控诉，铁路工人李勇奇和夹皮沟群众的英勇斗争，极其深刻地表达了千百万劳动人民对阶级敌人烈火般的憎恨，对党对毛主席对人民解放军的无限爱戴，表现出他们要求武装起来，用武装斗争去消灭敌人，解放自己的强烈愿望。这两场戏又从正面表现了人民子弟兵带着深厚的阶级感情去发动和组织群众的生动过程。《智取威虎山》全剧始终带着饱满的革命激情，歌颂了毛主席亲手缔造的中国人民解放军的伟大，歌颂了军爱民、民拥军这种军民之间的水乳交融的关系。剧情的发展令人信服地表明，正是基于毛主席的人民战争思想，正是因为有了革命群众所组成的铜墙铁壁，追剿队才得以出奇制胜，以少胜多。毛主席说，“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“在革命政府的周围团结起千百万群众来，发展我们的革命战争，我们就能消灭一切反革命，我们就能夺取全中国。”《智取威虎山》以巨大的艺术力量表明了这一伟大真理。
    人民革命战争，是无产阶级争取解放、夺取政权的根本途径。林彪同志说：“敢不敢进行人民战争，这是敢不敢革命的问题。”因此对待人民革命战争的态度，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和修正主义的一个分水岭。在这一问题上的斗争，也反映到文艺上。文艺要不要歌颂和表现人民革命战争？应该怎样去表现人民革命战争？这一问题是文艺领域里两个阶级、两条道路斗争的一个焦点。修正主义者是极端仇视人民革命战争的，他们对“枪杆子里面出政权”这一伟大真理，害怕得要死。文艺黑线的头目夏衍不是还亲自赤膊上阵，叫嚷要“离经叛道”吗？他们就是要离毛泽东思想之“经”，叛人民革命战争之“道”。无论是中国还是外国的修正主义者，在他们所炮制的所谓“战争文艺”里，都是千篇一律地抹煞正义战争和非正义战争的区别，拚命宣扬战争的“恐怖”和“苦难”。他们在法西斯军队身上去挖掘所谓“人性”，歌颂他们的“勇敢”和“顽强”；而在革命人民和革命军队身上寻找“阴暗面”，捏造他们的“软弱”和“动摇”。一句话，他们就是要污蔑和丑化革命人民和革命战争，实现其否定革命战争从而否定革命的政治阴谋。反动影片《一个人的遭遇》、《第四十一》、《红日》、《逆风千里》等等，就是这类修正主义文艺的标本。京剧《智取威虎山》好就好在它是反修正主义文艺之道而行之，全力地表现毛泽东思想之“经”，热情地歌颂人民革命战争之“道”。它不仅为京剧艺术而且为整个革命文艺正确表现人民革命战争，树立了光辉的榜样。
    二
    全力塑造用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士的英雄形象，并通过他们表现毛主席“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的光辉思想，是《智取威虎山》的另一个突出成就。
    要不要塑造无产阶级革命英雄形象？塑造英雄形象主要应该突出什么？这一直是文艺界两条路线斗争的焦点之一。不写英雄人物，专写中间人物；或者表面上写的是英雄人物，实际上用偷梁换柱的把戏，塞进资产阶级或小资产阶级的私货，在英雄人物的脸上抹黑，这是修正主义者惯用的伎俩。在塑造杨子荣的形象问题上，就有过激烈的斗争。在编导人员内部，也有不同的看法。一个突出的问题是：究竟把杨子荣写成“孤胆”英雄呢，还是写成“群胆”英雄？所谓“孤胆”英雄，那就是不突出政治、不突出毛泽东思想，用单纯军事观点去刻划英雄形象，似乎英雄之所以成为英雄，就是因为有非凡的本领，特殊的才能等等。原先，《智取威虎山》曾以不少离奇的情节和惊险的场面，孤立地突出了杨子荣的“智”和“勇”，结果不但情节不可信，而且严重地损害了英雄人物的思想境界。实践证明这条路走错了。江青同志及时扭转了这一偏向，强调必须把杨子荣塑造成一个“群胆”英雄，杨子荣的“胆”是革命的胆略；他的“智”和“勇”，是革命的大智大勇；这种革命胆略和大智大勇，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想，来源于他的高度的阶级觉悟和对无产阶级革命事业的无限忠诚，来自追剿队的坚强的战斗集体和千万个阶级弟兄的全力支援。按照江青同志的意见塑造的杨子荣的形象，是一个全身焕发着毛泽东思想的夺目光辉的高大形象。他在土匪眼中是本领高强的“好汉”，在观众心目中是无产阶级革命英雄。“深山问苦”一场，写出了杨子荣火一般的阶级感情，写出了他的侦察才能来自人民军队和人民的血肉联系。“定计”一场，又进一步写出他的大智大勇的深厚的阶级根源和思想基础。杨子荣上山有四个条件，最重要的一条就是“革命军人对党、对人民的赤胆忠心”，“一颗红心似火焰，化作利剑斩凶顽”。杨子荣正是带着千百万阶级兄弟的“群胆”，带着“愿红旗五洲四海齐招展”的宏伟理想，带着革命战士一不怕苦，二不怕死，一心为革命，一切为人民的高贵品质，打入匪窟的。正是因为这样，他才能在千钧一发的危急关头，首先在精神上压倒栾平，同时抓住敌人的矛盾和弱点，致敌于死命，夺取斗争的最后胜利。“抗严寒化冰雪我胸有朝阳”，杨子荣这句豪迈的唱词，一语道破了他之所以能排除万难，临危不惧的大智大勇的力量的源泉，揭示出战无不胜的毛泽东思想在一个普通的革命战士身上所产生的无穷威力。
    杨子荣这一艺术形象的塑造，为文艺创作提供了一个卓越的范例，它令人信服地表明，要在艺术舞台上树立起高大的革命英雄形象，最根本的一条，就是要写出他那崇高的精神境界，也就是写出他如何用毛泽东思想来武装自己，指导自己的革命行动。毛泽东思想多一分，革命英雄形象就高一分。离开了毛泽东思想，革命英雄形象就会象无根之木，无源之水，不仅不可能有生命和光彩，而且必然要走到邪道上去。
    少剑波的形象同样是光彩夺目的。作为一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的指挥员，《智取威虎山》着重刻划他如何正确地贯彻毛主席的政治路线和军事路线，实现党对军队的绝对领导，进行耐心细致的政治思想工作和群众工作。作为一个指挥员，他胸有全局，深谋远虑，坚决果断，指挥若定。而这一切，又不是因为他是天生的诸葛亮，善于神机妙算，而是因为他能紧跟毛主席的指示，又能深入下层，深入群众，虚心倾听战士和群众的意见，进行周密的调查研究，因而能对复杂的情况作出正确的判断，提出完整的切合实际的作战方案。在剧中，他和杨子荣的关系安排得恰如其分，他的行动，既不削弱杨子荣的形象，又充分发挥出一个正确有力的领导所应有的作用。在关键的问题上，他给予杨子荣以指导，但又放手让杨子荣去想、去闯、去干。这样，这两个英雄形象就交相辉映，相得益彰。
    《智取威虎山》在大力塑造人民军队的形象的同时，又大力加强人民群众的形象的创造，特别是加强作为千百万真心实意拥护革命的群众的代表人物李勇奇的创造。这一形象在戏里不是作为陪衬和点缀，而是作为体现毛主席人民战争思想的一个重要方面，而被放到了非常突出的地位。李勇奇饱受民族压迫和阶级压迫，他苦大仇深，没有丝毫奴颜媚骨。他爱憎分明，有那么一股子倔劲，象一团烈火，恨不能立即把整个旧世界和一切魔鬼通通烧成灰烬。这是中国劳动人民最可宝贵的性格。修正主义者就是千方百计抹煞这种革命品格，革命的文艺工作者就是要歌颂这种品格，并加以集中概括和典型化。《智取威虎山》正是这样做的，它写出李勇奇的倔劲，也就是写出了他对阶级敌人不共戴天的深仇大恨，写出了他的强烈的反抗精神。当然，剧本也并没有把李勇奇写成一个天生的有阶级觉悟的战士，而是合情合理地写出了在党的教育下，他的思想成长和变化的历程。李勇奇的形象有力地揭示出在中国劳动人民身上蕴藏着无穷无尽的革命潜力，使我们深深体会到“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中”这一伟大真理。
    由什么阶级统治艺术舞台，是区分不同阶级文艺的重要标志。“你是资产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂无产阶级而歌颂资产阶级；你是无产阶级文艺家，你就不歌颂资产阶级而歌颂无产阶级和劳动人民：二者必居其一。”京剧和一切旧文艺一样，居统治地位的一向是剥削阶级的人物。京剧革命就是要把这种历史的颠倒，再颠倒过来，大树无产阶级革命英雄的形象，使他们永远成为舞台的主人，这是无产阶级夺取京剧舞台领导权的关键，也是夺取一切文艺阵地的关键。在江青同志的直接指导下，《智取威虎山》在加工提高过程中确立了一个明确的创作思想：一切服从于在舞台上树立正面人物的英雄形象，无论是音乐、舞台美术等的处理，或是反面人物的处理，都必须服从上述的中心任务。过去曾经流传过一种论调：反面人物写得愈嚣张，就愈能显出正面人物的高大，这是荒谬绝顶的。对立面的双方，总有一方是占主导的、压倒对方的地位的。突出反面人物，其结果势必削弱以至歪曲正面人物。《智取威虎山》原先表现座山雕，用站立两厢、开山、点将、坐帐等手法来渲染他的反革命气派和气焰，还配以强烈的音乐效果，结果反面人物很嚣张，而杨子荣等正面人物则干巴巴，站不起来。江青同志发现后尖锐地指出，这是一个立场问题，阶级感情问题。她亲自领导重新设计，对反面人物，着重揭露他们垂死挣扎然而是穷途末路的“纸老虎”本质，在威虎厅一场，让座山雕一开始就靠边坐，并削弱了音乐效果；删除了定河老道等四个反面人物，以便腾出更多的篇幅集中地刻划三个主要的英雄形象。为了突出英雄形象，剧中运用了各种艺术手段特别是音乐手段，并在艺术形式上进行了一系列的创造和改革：为英雄人物安排了成套唱腔，在板式和曲调方面，大破旧流派和旧行当的框框，大胆地从现代革命音乐中吸取了新的战斗的旋律；全剧的前奏、结尾和许多重要情节，都以《中国人民解放军进行曲》作基调，这就对揭示无产阶级革命英雄人物的精神面貌起了有力的烘托作用；又如从生活出发，设计了雪地行军、滑雪、开打等新颖精彩的舞蹈场面，更形象地显示出人民军队英勇顽强、无坚不摧的英雄气概等等。《智取威虎山》就是这样充分运用了文学、音乐、舞蹈等艺术手段，成功地塑造了杨子荣等戏剧史上从未出现过的崭新的英雄形象，在京剧舞台上真正贯彻了毛主席《讲话》指出的方向，成功地让无产阶级革命英雄做了京剧舞台的主人。
    三
    夺取京剧舞台的领导权，是一场你死我活的阶级斗争。归根到底也就是一场复辟和反复辟、夺权和反夺权的政治斗争。“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”《智取威虎山》就是在两条路线的斗争中成长起来的。它的成长过程，经历了一场尖锐、曲折的阶级斗争，是京剧革命的一个缩影。
    京剧要不要、能不能演革命现代戏？这是《智取威虎山》遇到的第一场斗争。一九五八年我国在所有制方面的社会主义改造和反右斗争的胜利的基础上，祖国辽阔的大地上出现了震动世界的大跃进。“一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。”　
    在这种大好的革命形势下，《智取威虎山》和其他一些革命现代戏，象幼芽般地顶破了封建主义、资产阶级的重重禁锢，在京剧舞台上萌动了初开的蓓蕾。它们在当时尽管还并不完美，存在着这样那样的缺陷，但毕竟是新生事物。它们要改变京剧只演帝王将相的局面，使京剧为工农兵服务，这个大方向是完全正确的。但是，那些帝王将相的孝子贤孙——党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”们，惊慌万状，唯恐失去京剧这个地盘，唯恐剥削阶级断了香火。在中国的赫鲁晓夫这个总后台的支持下，他们疯狂地摧残京剧现代戏这个新生事物，什么“京剧不能演现代戏”啦，“简直是瞎胡闹”啦，冷讽、热嘲、明枪、暗箭一齐来。他们还利用窃取的职权，把《智取威虎山》打入冷宫，只是偶尔在逢年过节时拿出来演几场，装装门面。这棵京剧革命现代戏的幼苗，几乎被扼杀。这期间，他们甚至还命令演《智取威虎山》的剧团大演《海瑞上疏》、《四郎探母》、《七侠五义》之类的大毒草。在京剧舞台上，实行了反革命的大反扑、大倒算、大复辟。
   “已是悬崖百丈冰，犹有花枝俏。”就在牛鬼蛇神统治舞台的时候，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发现了《智取威虎山》这棵幼苗，认为它只要经过精心培育，一定可以成为参天大树。从一九六四年四月开始，江青同志亲自发起并领导对这个戏进行重大修改。江青同志根据毛主席的文艺思想，根据《讲话》指引的方向，提出了一系列重要的意见，不仅使《智取威虎山》获得了新的生命，也为京剧革命以至整个社会主义文学艺术作出了重大的贡献。
    但是，资产阶级代表人物却拚命顽抗，极力反对江青同志领导的京剧革命。他们施出两件法宝：一是否定《智取威虎山》的成就，妄图用“白开水”，“话剧加唱”的谩骂把它扼死；一是妄想把它引入为资产阶级政治服务的歧途。他们对《智取威虎山》的恶毒攻击，特别集中在树立革命英雄人物的问题上。一九六四年在北京举行京剧现代戏观摩演出时，他们的疯狂攻击达到了高潮。反革命修正主义分子林默涵直接指使别人写文章攻击这出戏，胡说突出杨子荣的革命精神就会使他的性格变得“拘束和沉郁”；鼓吹要突出杨子荣的“泼辣骠悍粗犷”即所谓“江湖气”“匪气”，渲染座山雕、栾平、一撮毛等土匪的嚣张气焰。杨子荣在这个戏里是作为人民军队的代表人物来塑造的，林默涵之流要在杨子荣脸上抹黑，硬要把“江湖气”、“匪气”强加给这个英雄人物，这难道不是在丑化我们整个人民军队吗？他们硬要削弱、扼杀杨子荣的革命精神，这难道不正是反对毛泽东思想作为我们人民军队的灵魂吗？
    正是这样。“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”林默涵之流如此攻击《智取威虎山》，绝不仅仅为了诋毁一个戏，而是有其更大的政治背景。我们知道，一九四六年的东北战场上存在着两条对立的军事路线：一条是林彪同志所坚决贯彻的毛主席的革命路线，一条是当时混在东北工作的反革命修正主义分子彭真所推行的中国的赫鲁晓夫的投降主义路线（这条军事路线曾给东北战场带来很大损失）。东北战场的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利，毛主席革命路线的胜利。《智取威虎山》歌颂的是毛主席的革命路线，这怎么能不触怒投降主义路线的提出者和推行者呢？林默涵作为中国的赫鲁晓夫的一条警犬，跳出来狂吠《智取威虎山》，正体现了他的主子对毛主席和林彪同志，对毛主席的革命路线的无限恐惧和刻骨仇恨。这说明了：京剧舞台上围绕着《智取威虎山》而展开的两条文艺路线的斗争，是政治舞台上代表两个阶级、两条政治路线、两条军事路线斗争的反映。
    江青同志坚决站在毛主席的革命路线这一边，高举无产阶级革命大旗，领导了这场斗争。她在一九六四年七月京剧现代戏观摩演出人员的座谈会上的讲话中，充分肯定了《智取威虎山》的成就，针对攻击者的谬论，尖锐地指出：“要考虑是坐在哪一边？是坐在正面人物一边，还是坐在反面人物一边？”这场辩论以敌人的失败而告终。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自看了《智取威虎山》，这是对京剧革命的最大关怀、最大鼓舞和最大支持。
    《智取威虎山》取得了很大成就以后，要不要加工提高，继续前进？向什么方向前进？这是关系到无产阶级占领的文艺阵地能不能巩固的大问题，是要不要把这场革命进行到底的大问题。
    汇报演出结束后，一九六五年四月，江青同志再度来上海，领导了《智取威虎山》的加工、提高。江青同志以无产阶级政治家的革命气魄，从全国人民和全世界革命人民的政治利益出发，对京剧革命作了战略上的考虑，她指出：一切艺术，不为资产阶级服务，就为无产阶级服务。京剧原来是演帝王将相，为封建主义、资产阶级服务的。原封不动地拿来为无产阶级服务是不行的。要改造，就要有革命的人，有披荆斩棘的人。我们要走自己的路，我们的艺术要在世界上起作用。我们要有雄心壮志，要替全国人民着想，要为全世界还在受压迫的人民着想。她要求创作、演出人员努力学习毛主席著作，深入部队学习解放军，实现思想革命化。她要求以“革命的牛劲”，精益求精，把《智取威虎山》加工、提高成革命样板戏；她对这个戏进行了科学分析，从文学剧本、音乐形象、导演、表演直到舞台美术，都和大家一道研究，提出了完整、精辟、行之有效的修改方案。她要求把革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式高度统一起来，把用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物塑造得更高大，用毛泽东思想去教育广大观众。
    把《智取威虎山》加工成革命样板戏，就是要夺取意识形态领域的无产阶级领导权，把一切牛鬼蛇神永远赶出舞台，彻底粉碎剥削阶级的反革命复辟的幻梦。正因为如此，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和反动“权威”老爷们，预感到他们的末日已经到了，就进行垂死挣扎。他们把这个戏看做眼中钉、肉中刺。他们设置障碍，制造纠纷，散布怀疑情绪，甚至胆大包天地对我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的意见也置若罔闻，极力破坏这个戏的加工、提高。京剧界的“南霸天”周信芳则破口大骂《智取威虎山》“不象京剧”，“京剧还要有京剧的规律”！污蔑加工样板戏“劳民伤财”。他们对革命现代戏就是这样仇恨！
    “蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”《智取威虎山》冲破了重重阻挠，击退了牛鬼蛇神的捣乱，和其他优秀革命样板戏一起，成为闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的艺术明珠，开辟了京剧革命的光辉道路，在世界革命艺术史上写下了划时代的一页。
    《智取威虎山》的成长过程表明：在无产阶级夺取了政权并进行了所有制的变革之后，资产阶级及其在党内的代表人物必然要在文艺领域及其他意识形态领域里顽强地表现他们的政治主张，总是顽固地利用他们所霸占的各种思想文化阵地，为阴谋进行反革命复辟、发动反革命政变制造舆论。我们进行京剧革命，进行无产阶级文化革命，归根到底是为了保护社会主义经济基础，保卫无产阶级专政，保证我们的社会主义江山永不变色。
    《智取威虎山》的出现还表明：只要我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，京剧这个顽固堡垒是可以攻破的，一切旧的堡垒也都是可以攻破的。帝国主义、现代修正主义污蔑我们“破坏文化”。对于资本主义、封建主义的腐朽文化，我们就是要破坏，彻底地破坏。不破不立，不塞不流，只有荡涤了资本主义和封建主义的污泥浊水，才能创造出最新最美的无产阶级新文化。一花喜报天下春。《智取威虎山》作为京剧革命中最鲜红的花朵，向世界宣告无产阶级革命文艺的百花盛开的春天来临了！如果把我们无产阶级创造的艺术样板比作枝叶繁茂的参天大树，那么，地主阶级、资产阶级千百年来苦心经营的所谓艺术“高峰”，至多只能算是一棵在西风中摇曳的枯草，相比之下，它是何等渺小啊！
    《智取威虎山》取得了巨大的成就，但是对无产阶级来说，这还只是万里长征的第一步。更长的征途，要我们走；更高的山峰，要我们去攀。让我们沿着伟大领袖毛主席指引的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，学习江青同志的革命精神，披荆斩棘，排除万难，去夺取新的胜利吧！
