The New Zealand Communist Party delegation, after concluding their visit to our country, stopped in Hong Kong on their way back. On May 23, they visited and warmly greeted the Hong Kong Chinese compatriots who bravely resisted the fascist bloody atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong.

The delegation members had a cordial conversation with the honorably wounded Hong Kong Chinese compatriots. They said, "When we heard about the savage fascist bloody atrocities committed by the British colonial authorities against the Chinese workers and residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon, and saw with our own eyes the fully armed fascist thugs strutting in the streets of Hong Kong, we were filled with indignation. We bring the greetings of the working class and revolutionary people of New Zealand to you. In your struggle against British imperialism and national oppression, you have shown the heroic spirit of the Chinese working class that fears no tyranny. We learn from you."

The delegation members emphasized, "Your struggle is just. We firmly support you in carrying your anti-persecution struggle to the end. Your struggle is our struggle. Your brave struggle inspires the working class and revolutionary people of New Zealand. The revolutionary people of the world, unite! Persist in struggle! Victory will surely be ours."

The delegation members shouted in unison: "Down with the fascist atrocities of the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong! Long live proletarian internationalism! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years, ten thousand years!"

Finally, the New Zealand comrades pinned the Chairman Mao badges, which they had received from the Chinese revolutionary masses, onto the chests of the injured.

    回国途中经过香港
    新共代表团亲切慰问抗暴战士
    据新华社香港二十六日电新西兰共产党代表团结束了在我国的参观访问，回国途中二十三日在这里向英勇抗击港英当局法西斯血腥暴行的香港中国同胞进行了亲切的慰问。
    代表团的成员和光荣受伤的香港中国同胞进行了亲切的谈话。他们说，当我们听到港英当局对港九中国工人和中国居民野蛮的法西斯血腥暴行，并且亲眼看到全副武装的法西斯暴徒在香港街头张牙舞爪，感到无比的愤怒。我们带着新西兰工人阶级和革命人民的心意，向你们致以亲切的慰问。你们在反对英帝国主义，反对民族压迫的斗争中，表现了中国工人阶级不畏强暴的英雄气概，我们向你们学习。
    代表团的成员强调说，你们的斗争是正义的，我们坚决支持你们把反迫害斗争进行到底。你们的斗争也就是我们的斗争，你们的英勇斗争鼓舞着我们新西兰工人阶级和革命人民。全世界革命人民联合起来，坚持斗争，胜利一定是属于我们的。
    代表团的成员齐声高呼：“反对港英法西斯暴行！”“无产阶级国际主义万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”最后，新西兰的同志们把中国革命群众送给他们的毛主席像章，亲手别在伤员的胸前。
