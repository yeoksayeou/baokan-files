Once, a Bulgarian elder saw a Chinese comrade wearing a shiny Chairman Mao badge on his chest and asked enviously, "Where can I buy a Chairman Mao badge?" The Chinese comrade told him that he couldn't buy one in Bulgaria and took off the Chairman Mao badge from his own chest to give it to the elder. The elder was very moved and repeatedly expressed his gratitude. He called a young man standing nearby over to him and said, "This is my son. He also wants a Chairman Mao badge. Since there is only one, it's better for the young man to wear it first." Then he personally put the Chairman Mao badge on his son and walked with him to a large mirror, proudly looking at themselves in the mirror again and again.

    让亲人戴上毛主席像章
    有一次，一位保加利亚老人看到中国同志胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，非常羡慕地问这位中国同志：“在什么地方可以买到毛主席像章？”中国同志告诉他在保加利亚买不到，并把自己胸前佩戴的毛主席像章摘下来赠送给他。这位老人非常激动，一再表示感谢。他把在旁边的一位青年人叫到跟前说：“这是我的儿子，他也想要毛主席像章，现在只有一枚，还是先让青年人戴上它为好。”于是他亲手把毛主席像章给儿子戴上，然后两人一同走到一面大镜子前，自豪地对着镜子照了又照。
