Sunlight Shines Over Qinghua Garden
— The Giant Statue of Great Leader Chairman Mao is Completed at Tsinghua University

“Long live Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line!”
“Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!”
“The most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, long live! Long live! Ten thousand years live!”
…

On the 4th, in Tsinghua University, the crowd roared with enthusiasm and excitement.

A giant statue of Chairman Mao stands tall in Qinghua Garden!

This statue of Chairman Mao, made of steel and concrete, stands 8.1 meters high including the pedestal, like the majestic Mount Tai, firmly standing in the center of Tsinghua University. Chairman Mao is dressed in a military overcoat, radiant and vigorous, raising his powerful arm to point the way forward for the countless loyal revolutionary students and the people. On the front of the pedestal, the words of Comrade Lin Biao are inscribed: “Long live the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years live!”

This giant statue of Chairman Mao was carefully crafted by the soldiers of the Jinggangshan Detachment of Tsinghua University, with the help of revolutionary factions from many units, in just over a month.

The soldiers of the Jinggangshan Detachment said:
“We want to make the glorious image of our great leader Chairman Mao tall and grand, so that we can see Chairman Mao as soon as we look up, and let Chairman Mao always be with us!”

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, during the time when a handful of revisionists were in power, the revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University had strongly demanded and urgently called for many times to express their class feelings of unlimited love, loyalty, belief, and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao. They demanded that the garden be filled with Chairman Mao’s quotations, hung with Chairman Mao’s portraits, and that a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works be initiated in the garden. They demanded that the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought be established in the garden. However, a handful of revisionists hated our great leader Chairman Mao and feared the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They did everything they could to suppress the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao’s works, crazily resisted Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, and tried every means to erase the image of our great leader Chairman Mao, which was extremely tall and glorious in the hearts of the revolutionary teachers and students. They did not allow the writing of Chairman Mao’s quotations, the studying of Chairman Mao’s works, or the hanging of Chairman Mao’s portraits, claiming that it was “an eyesore”! On the contrary, they prepared to spend a large amount of money to build statues of scholars from the feudal era and reactionary “authorities” of the bourgeoisie in Qinghua Garden. In this way, the revolutionary wishes of the revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University were ruthlessly suppressed.

The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally ignited by our great leader Chairman Mao, burned into Qinghua Garden. The revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University, who had been suppressed by a handful of revisionists, rose up in rebellion! They wrote one quotation of Chairman Mao after another in the campus, hung one portrait of Chairman Mao after another on the walls, and especially strongly demanded the construction of a tall statue of Chairman Mao by their side. However, they did not expect that at this moment, the mastermind behind the handful of revisionists—the top capitalist-roader in the Party—appeared on the scene with murderous intent. He threw out the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and sent Wang Xixi to suppress the revolutionary mass movement in Qinghua Garden. These people, in the face of the revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University, spread the counter-revolutionary poison of “Cultivation” and crazily slandered the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. They wildly praised the top capitalist-roader in the Party and maliciously opposed Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Under these circumstances, the revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University wanted to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to realize their wish to build a statue of Chairman Mao in Qinghua Garden, which was once again seriously suppressed and unreasonably obstructed.

However, ants cannot shake a big tree, and clouds cannot block the sun! The soldiers of the Jinggangshan Detachment of Tsinghua University and the revolutionary teachers and students, under the guidance of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, went through a serious struggle, exposed a handful of revisionists in Qinghua Garden, exposed the butchers who suppressed the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of Tsinghua University, and together with the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, dug out the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao achieved a decisive victory in Qinghua Garden!

The revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University finally realized their revolutionary wish. A solemn, sublime, and majestic statue of Chairman Mao, personally crafted by them, stands tall in Qinghua Garden. This is the victory of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line! It is the victory of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

On the 4th, when this giant statue of Chairman Mao was completed in Qinghua Garden, many revolutionary masses from the capital and some foreign friends came to congratulate. Together with the revolutionary teachers and students of Tsinghua University, they, with hearts full of utmost respect, paid homage to the great image of Chairman Mao and wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

Long live! Ten thousand years live!”

### 阳光普照清华园——伟大领袖毛主席的巨型塑像在清华大学落成

    阳光普照清华园
    ——伟大领袖毛主席的巨型塑像在清华大学落成
    “毛主席的无产阶级革命路线万岁！”
    “战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”
    “最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”……
    四日，在清华大学，万众欢呼，群情沸腾。
    一座巨型的毛主席全身塑像，在清华园矗立起来了！
    这座用钢筋水泥制作的毛主席塑像，加上底座，高达八点一米，象雄伟的泰山，巍然屹立在清华大学校园中心。毛主席身穿军大衣，神采奕奕，高举他老人家那雄劲的手臂，为无限忠于他的革命师生和亿万人民指出前进的方向。在塑像底座的正面，刻着林彪同志的题词：“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    这座巨型的毛主席塑像，是清华大学井冈山兵团的战士们，在许多单位革命派大力协助下，用革命的红心和双手，在一个多月的时间里，精心塑造出来的。
    井冈山兵团的战士们说：
    “我们要把伟大领袖毛主席的光辉形象塑得高高的，大大的，我们好抬头就能看到毛主席，让毛主席他老人家永远和我们在一起！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命以前，在一小撮修正主义分子当权的岁月里，清华大学的革命师生为了表达对我们伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的阶级感情，提出过多少次强烈要求，发出过多少个紧急呼吁啊！他们要求在清华园内写满毛主席语录，挂满毛主席像，他们要求在清华园掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，他们要求在清华园确立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。但是一小撮修正主义分子仇视我们伟大领袖毛主席，惧怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，千方百计地扼杀学习毛主席著作的群众运动，疯狂抵制毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，想方设法妄图磨灭我们伟大领袖毛主席在广大革命师生心目中无比高大光辉的形象。他们不让写毛主席语录，不让学习毛主席著作，不让挂毛主席像，胡说什么这“有碍观瞻”！相反，他们却准备拿出大量资金在清华园内建起封建时代学者和资产阶级反动“权威”的塑像。就这样，清华大学革命师生们的革命愿望，遭到了无情的打击。
    由伟大领袖毛主席亲手点燃的无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，烧进了清华园，在一小撮修正主义分子压制下的清华大学革命师生们起来造反了！他们在校园里写起了一条又一条毛主席语录，他们在墙壁上挂起了一张又一张毛主席像，他们特别强烈地要求在自己身边建起一座高大的毛主席塑像。但是他们那里想到，就在这个时候，一小撮修正主义分子的总后台——党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，杀气腾腾地出场了。他抛出了资产阶级反动路线，派出了王××到清华园镇压革命群众运动。这些家伙，在清华大学革命师生面前，极力散布《修养》的反革命毒素，疯狂地诋毁光焰无际的毛泽东思想，大肆吹捧党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，处心积虑地反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在这种情况下，清华大学革命师生要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在清华园塑造起毛主席塑像的愿望又一次受到严重的压制和无理的阻挠。
    但是，蚍蜉撼不动大树，乌云遮不住太阳！清华大学井冈山兵团的战士们，革命师生们，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，经过了严重斗争，揪出了清华园内一小撮修正主义分子，揪出了扼杀清华大学无产阶级文化大革命运动的刽子手，并且和亿万革命群众一起，挖出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在清华园内取得了决定性的胜利！
    清华大学的革命师生终于实现了自己的革命愿望，一座由他们亲手塑造的庄严、崇高、雄伟的毛主席塑像，在清华园矗立起来了。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的胜利！是伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利！
    四日，当这座巨型毛主席塑像在清华园落成的时候，首都许多革命群众和一些外国朋友纷纷前往祝贺。他们和清华大学的革命师生们一起，怀着无比崇敬的心情，瞻仰毛主席的伟大形象，同声祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！　据新华社（附图片）
