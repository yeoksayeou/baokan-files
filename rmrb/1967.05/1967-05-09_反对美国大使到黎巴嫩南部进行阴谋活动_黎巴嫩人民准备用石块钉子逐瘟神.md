After suffering repeated failures in its aggression policy in the Middle East, U.S. imperialism is now attempting to hatch new plots in Lebanon, but it has immediately encountered strong opposition from the Lebanese people.

According to a report by the Syrian newspaper *Al-Thawra*, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon is planning to visit the southern Lebanese city of Tyre to attend a gathering of 300 people. The newspaper points out that this is a high-level intelligence meeting to discuss the issue of the U.S. Sixth Fleet's "visit" to the port of Beirut.

The newspaper reports that the people of Tyre and another city, Sidon, through which the U.S. ambassador will pass, are preparing to "welcome" the ambassador with stones and protests. In Tyre, shop windows and walls are plastered with protest leaflets. Locals have piled up stones, nails, and gasoline at street corners in anticipation of the arrival of American cars. When he arrives, shops will close in protest, and citizens will gather at the city's entrances to prevent the ambassador from entering. Youths in other cities and villages in southern Lebanon have been called upon to go to Tyre to join the struggle.

The newspaper points out: It is quite obvious that U.S. foreign policy is encountering protests everywhere, and the method of using dollars to carry out its foreign policy no longer works. What awaits the officials who peddle U.S. foreign policy in various places are stones and rotten eggs.

The U.S. Sixth Fleet recently requested permission from the Lebanese government to "visit" Beirut at the end of this month. This news has sparked strong reactions from Lebanese public opinion. Lebanese MP Rashid Solh demanded at the end of April to cancel the decision to allow the Sixth Fleet to visit Lebanon. He said that allowing the U.S. Sixth Fleet to come to Lebanon is a provocation to national sentiments and support for Israel's aggression against Syria. He also condemned Israel's recent aggression against Syria.

    反对美国大使到黎巴嫩南部进行阴谋活动
    黎巴嫩人民准备用石块钉子逐瘟神
    新华社大马士革七日电  美帝国主义在中东的侵略政策不断遭到失败后，最近又企图在黎巴嫩策划新阴谋，但立刻遭到黎巴嫩人民的强烈反对。
    据叙利亚《革命报》报道，美国驻黎巴嫩大使准备到黎巴嫩南部城市苏尔出席一个有三百人参加的集会。这家报纸指出，这是一次高级情报人员的集会，要讨论美国第六舰队“访问”贝鲁特港的问题。
    报纸说，苏尔市以及美国大使将路过的另一城市赛伊达的人民准备用石块和抗议来“迎接”这位美国大使。在苏尔市，商店的橱窗和墙上都贴满了抗议的传单。当地市民已在各街道的拐角处堆放了石块、钉子和汽油，等候美国汽车的到来。当他到达时，商店将关门表示抗议，市民将在城市的入口处集合，阻止美国大使进入市内。在黎巴嫩南方省的其他城市和乡村的青年已被号召到苏尔市去参加斗争。
    报纸指出：非常明显，美国的对外政策到处遭到抗议，美国靠美元来执行它的对外政策的办法已经行不通了。在各地等待着兜售美国对外政策的官员的，是石块和臭鸡蛋。
    美国第六舰队最近向黎巴嫩政府提出要求在本月底“访问”贝鲁特。这个消息引起了黎巴嫩公众舆论的强烈反应。黎巴嫩议员拉希德·索勒哈在四月底就要求取消让第六舰队“访问”黎巴嫩的决定。他说，让美国第六舰队到黎巴嫩，是对民族感情的挑衅，是支持以色列侵略叙利亚。他还谴责以色列最近对叙利亚的侵略。
