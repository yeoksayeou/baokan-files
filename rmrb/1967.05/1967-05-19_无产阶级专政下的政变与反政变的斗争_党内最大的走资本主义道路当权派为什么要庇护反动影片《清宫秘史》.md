The reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" praises the failed "palace coup" launched by the bourgeois reformers at the end of the 19th century.

In the late 1890s, the Boxer Movement was on the rise, and the Qing Dynasty was on the brink of collapse. At this critical moment, the landlord leader Guangxu, along with the monarchist Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, attempted to rely on the power of imperialism to carry out some superficial "reforms" without touching the feudal foundations. Their goal was to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the burgeoning mass movement.

The reform movement led by Guangxu encountered opposition from the conservative faction led by Empress Dowager Cixi. Thus, within the feudal ruling class, a fierce struggle for power and counter-power ensued. However, whether it was the conservative faction led by Cixi and Ronglu or the reformist faction led by Guangxu and Kang Youwei, regardless of the methods and strategies they employed, they all sought to rely on imperialist power to suppress the rising Boxer Movement, aiming to maintain their ruling positions. The shared mentality was "rather give it to a friendly country than to a domestic slave."

The path Guangxu intended to take was, in essence, the same as Cixi's—a path of betrayal. Even if Guangxu's coup had succeeded, the future could only be that of a traitorous puppet emperor. The film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" vigorously praises and beautifies such a path, clearly indicating that it is a thoroughly traitorous film.

In March 1950, when the film was first screened nationwide, Chairman Mao sternly pointed out that "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is a traitorous film and should be criticized.

However, the top capitalist-roader in the party openly defied Chairman Mao, claiming that this traitorous film was "patriotic."

In October 1954, Chairman Mao once again sternly pointed out that the film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty," which was called patriotic but was actually traitorous, had not been criticized nationwide after its screening.

However, the top capitalist-roader in the party was audacious and continued to maliciously promote the bourgeois "reforms." Under his encouragement and instruction, reactionary performances similar to "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" began to flourish in liberated China. In 1954, the Yue opera "Guangxu and Zhen Fei" premiered. Subsequently, various forms of drama such as spoken drama, Shanghai opera, Yang opera, and dialect drama performed this "coup" play in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and various parts of Northeast China. In 1957, Beijing staged the spoken drama "Palace Grievances" (the blueprint for the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty") and introduced it as a model performance to other regions. As late as 1962, Beijing still performed the Beijing opera "Zhen Fei."

In December 1965, just a month after Comrade Yao Wenyuan's "On the New Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'" was published, the surging waves of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could already be heard. At this time, Chairman Mao once again sternly pointed out: "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty," which some say is patriotic, I see as traitorous, thoroughly traitorous. The top capitalist-roader in the party still attempted a desperate struggle. He hastily gathered his subordinate bigwigs like Peng Zhen to concoct the reactionary "February Outline," trying to obstruct the irresistible wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which would bury all ghosts and monsters, under the cover of "pure academic discussion."

Why did the top capitalist-roader in the party so diligently shelter the reactionary traitorous film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty"? Why did he repeatedly resist and defy Chairman Mao's wise instructions to criticize this reactionary film? And why did he show such pity for Guangxu, who was even despised by Zhang Taiyan as the "jester Zai Tian"? These questions have long been a mystery.

Comrade Chen Boda's article finally exposed the truth. These questions ultimately boil down to the struggle between the bourgeoisie seizing power and the proletariat counter-seizing power.

In 1949, under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people achieved a great victory in the democratic revolution. The proletariat seized power, but the bourgeoisie was not willing to give up. They wanted to snatch the fruits of victory. The top capitalist-roader in the party was the biggest political thief representing the bourgeoisie in snatching the fruits of victory from the proletariat.

The bourgeoisie's struggle to seize power under the dictatorship of the proletariat sometimes involves colluding with imperialism to carry out armed intervention from the outside, but more often it is through the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Communist Party, especially those who have infiltrated the party's leadership, to carry out peaceful evolution. Peaceful evolution is a highly covert method of seizing power. It often makes people unknowingly and comfortably transition to revisionism. However, things always develop from gradual change to sudden change. Peaceful evolution, when it reaches a certain point, will develop into a "palace coup" or a non-peaceful armed coup. In 1955, the head of modern revisionism, Khrushchev, successfully carried out a "palace coup" after long-term conspiracies.

The top capitalist-roader in the party is well-versed in these intricacies. "A kindred spirit understands without words," he and the Guangxu in the film share the same ailment, ancient and modern alike. One Guangxu says, "The power is not in my hands." Another "Guangxu" says, "Huang Jinrong is old and has voluntarily given up his seat to Chiang Kai-shek." The living and the dead share the same thought: seize power, seize power; coup, coup. Therefore, for the top capitalist-roader in the party, sheltering the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is not just about sheltering a film; it is a major issue of maintaining a reactionary stance and attempting a counter-revolutionary coup. In fact, the criticism of the historical or artistic figures Guangxu and Zhen Fei will inevitably lead to the negation of the "Guangxu" and "Zhen Fei" in real life. Once the criticism of the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" begins, the counter-revolutionary faces of the top capitalist-roader in the party and a small group of revisionists, who dream of capitalist restoration, will be exposed in broad daylight.

Last May, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Those bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, government, army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The top capitalist-roader in the party is such a revisionist representative who sleeps by our side, constantly plotting to seize power.

The top capitalist-roader in the party wants to carry out a counter-revolutionary coup and must prepare the necessary conditions, which is to implement a bourgeois reactionary line that suppresses the revolutionary spirit of the people and represses the revolutionary mass movement.

The line question is ultimately a question of relying on whom, uniting with whom, and opposing whom. Whether in seizing power or consolidating power, there is always this question: relying on whom to seize power, hold power, and use power? Using power to support whom, protect whom, oppose whom, and suppress whom? The line question, fundamentally, is a question of attitude towards the masses and mass movements. Whether to support or oppose the masses and mass movements is a crucial marker distinguishing revolution from counter-revolution.

Different lines lead to different outcomes. Trusting the masses, relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, respecting the masses' initiative, and supporting revolutionary mass movements—this is the proletarian revolutionary line. Implementing this line will inevitably lead to the victory of the people's revolution, leading to socialism and communism. Conversely, relying on a few exploiting classes, suppressing and deceiving the broad revolutionary masses, and repressing revolutionary mass movements—this is the bourgeois reactionary line. Following this line will only result in the proletariat losing the power it has already seized, leading to the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, the bourgeois reactionary line is essentially a line to subvert the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out a counter-revolutionary coup.

For seventeen years, the top capitalist-roader in the party has consistently implemented the bourgeois reactionary line to serve his dream of a counter-revolutionary coup. He conspires to put a heavy spiritual shackle on the minds of the masses, making the broad masses become "Liu Bei," blindly following him to restore capitalism; and after carrying out the counter-revolutionary coup, they dare not rebel.

The political line embodied in the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" perfectly suits this big conspirator. The film proposes a complete and thorough line of betrayal: relying on imperialism and feudal landlords with bourgeois characteristics and their intellectuals, suppressing the people's revolutionary movements, and turning China into a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. The bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the top capitalist-roader in the party is essentially a new version of the betrayal line in the film under new historical conditions; they share the same political goals.

The true protagonist of the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is the unseen imperialism, which is the backer of Guangxu and others in carrying out reforms and coups. The film declares through the mouth of the imperialist agent Zhen Fei that imperialism "will help the emperor restore his throne and revive the court." At the same time, the film greatly praises the feudal intellectuals with some bourgeois characteristics, such as Weng Tonghe and Kang Youwei, who are known as "new faction" figures, intending to rely on them to carry out reforms from the top down, cleverly preserving feudal forces and consolidating the feudalist regime.

How does the film treat the masses? At that time, the Boxer Movement, representing the interests of the broad laboring masses, was essentially the target of the counter-power struggle by Guangxu and others. The film madly slanders this great revolutionary mass movement, praising the imperialist massacre policy, thereby illustrating that power should not fall into the hands of this group of "mob."

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Revolutionary mass movements are inherently reasonable. Although there are some 'left' and 'right' deviations among the masses, the mainstream of mass movements always conforms to the development of society and is reasonable." The Boxer Movement seventy years ago fully proves this truth. Millions of revolutionary peasant masses in this movement fear neither heaven nor earth, nor foreigners nor officials. They wore red hats, wrapped red belts around their waists, and wrapped their swords in red cloth, forming a vast revolutionary rebel army. In the battle of Langfang and the Tianjin railway station, they fought the invading army to a rout. Along the way, the Boxers also fiercely opposed the landlord officials and comprador running dogs, raided their homes, and knocked them down one by one. Towards the people, they were disciplined and did not harm a single hair. They clearly distinguished between enemies and friends, directly aiming at imperialism and feudalism. Their general direction was always correct.

However, in the film, in the eyes of the ancient Guangxu and the current "Guangxu," the masses have two characteristics: on the one hand, they are "mob," a group of arsonists, witchcraft, and "demons"; on the other hand, they are "ignorant masses." The film, through the mouth of Weng Tonghe, says: "The common people are the most obedient and also the easiest to satisfy." Completely denying the revolutionary nature of the masses is extremely malicious.

The attitude towards the Boxer Movement in the film is the same as the attitude towards the revolutionary mass movements in real political life. The top capitalist-roader in the party and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, in today's Cultural Revolution, do not also slander revolutionary rebels as "mobs" and "barbarians"? On the other hand, do they not also regard revolutionary masses as "obedient" "Liu Bei"? If it were not for the same class stance, how could such consistency appear?

The top capitalist-roader in the party, in preparation for counter-revolutionary restoration, stubbornly implements a bourgeois reactionary line, extremely hates the broad revolutionary masses, and fiercely represses revolutionary mass movements. In 1955, when China's socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private capitalist industry and commerce was in full swing, the broad peasant and worker masses resolutely took the socialist path. The top capitalist-roader in the party jumped out to obstruct, instructing an old right-opportunist to "definitely shrink" the agricultural cooperativization movement. In 1958, under the brilliant guidance of the party's line for socialist construction, a magnificent mass movement of the Great Leap Forward and the people's communes emerged. This grand movement made "the past exploiting classes completely sink into the vast ocean of the laboring masses." This again caused great dissatisfaction for the top capitalist-roader in the party. Later, when the country faced temporary difficulties in 1962, he personally took the stage, venting all the words he wanted to say but dared not in 1958. He slandered the mass movement at that time as "a sudden surge," slandered the Great Leap Forward as "like a person suffering from a serious illness," as "a pitch-black mess." In 1964, China launched the socialist education movement. This movement initially touched the social base of the top capitalist-roader in the party's counter-revolutionary coup. He felt the threat of winter, so he suddenly appeared in a "leftist" guise, implementing a line of opportunism that is "leftist" in form but rightist in essence, shifting the focus of struggle to the vast majority of cadres and the masses, to protect a small group of revisionists.

Our great leader Chairman Mao personally ignited the flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The top capitalist-roader in the party sensed that his end was near. He once again hastily raised the broken flag of the bourgeois reactionary line, confusing right and wrong, suppressing different opinions, carrying out white terror, thinking he was triumphant, boosting the bourgeois spirit, and suppressing the spirit of the proletariat. How poisonous!

He defended himself, saying that he made a line error because he "did not understand," because he "misjudged the situation," which is all nonsense! He understood very well and judged correctly! Relying on decades of counter-revolutionary experience, he knew that this was a revolution to overthrow him and shatter his counter-revolutionary coup fantasy. He made a desperate struggle, hoping to slip through and continue his coup plot. However, all his performances more thoroughly exposed his counter-revolutionary face, more accelerated the final collapse of the bourgeois reactionary line he represented, and more promoted the deep development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The bourgeois reactionary line implemented by the top capitalist-roader in the party is the longest and thickest line of right-opportunism, or revisionism, in our party's history. This black line, fundamentally, is for the restoration of capitalism. Thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line and eliminating its poison is to fundamentally prevent the restoration of capitalism and prevent counter-revolutionary coups!

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, an important condition for carrying out a counter-revolutionary coup is to implement peaceful evolution. Only by preemptively corrupting people's thoughts from all aspects, disintegrating the socialist system, and preparing for the counter-revolutionary coup in terms of ideology, system, and organization, can the coup ultimately be realized. The bitter lesson of the Soviet Party and state changing color fully proves this.

What does the reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" propagate? It vigorously advocates "reforms and innovations," advocating learning from the West, walking the old path of Western bourgeoisie, and promoting capitalism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, this was already an utterly impractical fantasy. Bringing this set of "new policies" to a socialist country in the mid-20th century can only be advocating the peaceful evolution from socialism to capitalism. The so-called "new policies" are actually the black jargon of peaceful evolution. The reactionary film "The Last Days of the Qing Dynasty" is the flag of summoning the spirits of the bourgeois republic, the tool to drum up for the restoration of capitalism.

What are the contents of Guangxu and Kang Youwei's "new policies"? Kang Youwei himself once summarized: swearing to the ministers to determine the national policy, setting up the "Petition Office" to broaden the channels for speech, establishing the "Institutional Bureau" to determine new systems, and setting up the "Strategy Office" to recruit talents. In other words, the main contents of the so-called "new policies" are nothing more than creating public opinion, changing systems, and building teams. The top capitalist-roader in the party's implementation of the so-called "new policies" or "new systems" on socialist land is also nothing more than these three aspects.

First is creating public opinion.

Chairman Mao teaches us: to overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this. Before Khrushchev came to power, he first allowed bourgeois ideology to spread freely and actively created various counter-revolutionary public opinions. The top capitalist-roader in the party also follows this path. For seventeen years, he has been controlling the pen, engaging in theory, academia, and literature, and poisoning in various fields of the ideological and cultural front, preparing public opinion for the counter-revolutionary coup.

He threw out the "unification of two into one" theory through the counter-revolutionary revisionist Yang Xianzhen, openly advocating the abolition of class struggle and class reconciliation. He has always advocated that "two opposing things combine into a new thing." He is the biggest proponent of the "unification of two into one" theory, the ancestor of the "unification of two into one" theory. He incited his henchmen, such as Sun Yefang and other counter-revolutionary revisionists, to advocate material incentives and the supremacy of money. He is the root of the black line in counter-revolutionary literature. Under his shelter and support, for seventeen years, a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by Zhou Yang in the literary circle have fiercely opposed Chairman Mao's literary thoughts and line, turning most of the literary leadership organizations into tools of bourgeois dictatorship, into the Petofi Club. He instructed a group of bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" to write "reversal" articles in the historical field, falsifying party history, and openly drumming up for the restoration of capitalism. He is also the biggest advocate of the bourgeois educational line. He strongly opposed Chairman Mao's educational policy, advocating the revisionist two-track educational system and two-track labor system, attempting to turn schools into social pillars for the restoration of capitalism.

All the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of the top capitalist-roader in the party boil down to one point: opposing Chairman Mao and opposing Mao Zedong Thought. He madly directs his spearhead at our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. He wields the big stick of "simplification" and "vulgarization," slandering the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers studying Chairman Mao's works. He denies that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. He shadows and viciously attacks Chairman Mao, saying things like "China has not yet had a Stalin, only we can work"; "the higher the official, the less truth"; "anyone who claims to be a leader... cannot become a leader." He opposes learning from Chairman Mao's works, saying that we should "learn from everyone with truth in the party, both inside and outside, not from those in high positions." He uses the pretext of "being a good student of Marx and Lenin" to oppose Comrade Lin Biao's proposal to "be a good student of Chairman Mao." He also openly shelters the reactionary slogan "support the Party Central Committee, oppose Chairman Mao." What kind of "Party Central Committee" does he want, and what does he want to do? Isn't it clear? Isn't he the Khrushchev sleeping by our side? Can we ignore such a ferocious enemy?

Next is changing the system.

The socialist period is the historical period of transition from capitalism to communism, a period in which communist factors gradually increase and capitalist factors gradually die out. Khrushchev's modern revisionism, instead of seriously transforming capitalist forces, actively develops them and strives to disintegrate the socialist system, making it gradually degenerate into capitalism. The top capitalist-roader in the party follows closely. He is always on the lookout for opportunities, waiting for the right moment, trying to preserve and expand the capitalist base. Especially during the three years of temporary difficulties, he thought the time was ripe. Thus, he, together with a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists under his command, in coordination with the anti-China waves stirred up by international imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, accelerated his steps and put forward a complete set of counter-revolutionary revisionist programs for the restoration of capitalism.

In the industrial sector, he advocates "managing the economy with economic methods," learning from capitalist management methods, advocating profit supremacy and technology first, opposing party leadership, and opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, attempting to turn socialist industrial and mining enterprises into capitalist enterprises.

In the agricultural sector, he fiercely attacks the people's communes for being "established too early" and "mismanaged," strongly promotes the "single farming" wind, and vigorously advocates the "three selfs and one contract," attempting to disintegrate the socialist collective economy and make socialist cooperative agriculture return to capitalist individual economy.

In the financial and commercial sector, he strongly advocates free markets, self-production, and self-sale, promotes high-end, high-priced goods, expands differences, blindly pursues commercial profits, and shrinks and weakens the socialist base.

In the field of science and technology, he advocates that technology determines everything, promotes the white expert road of individual struggle, vigorously cultivates a new group of scientific and technological aristocrats, attempting to turn the scientific and technological community into a kingdom of bourgeois intellectuals.

In the field of literature and art, he strongly opposes Chairman Mao's policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the integration of literary and artistic workers with workers, peasants, and soldiers, advocates the "three highs" (high salary, high manuscript fee, high bonus), promotes bourgeois liberalization, encourages a large number of anti-party and anti-socialist poisonous weeds to emerge, and creates public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

In education, he advocates knowledge first and scores first, actively peddles the capitalist "dual-track education system," emphasizes professor-led schools, and makes the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools continue for a long time, attempting to cultivate our next generation into the successors of the bourgeoisie.

In party work, he threw out the meticulously revised revisionist program for seizing the party, "Cultivation," opposing class struggle, opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposing Mao Zedong Thought, advocating slavery, individualism, and idealism, attempting to poison the broad masses of party members, making them into "tame tools" blindly following him to restore capitalism.

Finally, he builds teams.

The political line determines the organizational line. What kind of work is done depends on what kind of people are used. To restore capitalism, just like Khrushchev did, one can only recruit a group of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. For many years, the top capitalist-roader in the party, in order to carry out a counter-revolutionary coup, secretly recruited soldiers and surrendered traitors behind Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. He has "San Jia Village" type vanguards and "Si Jia Shop" type generals. He has gathered a group of Kang Youwei and Yuan Shikai-like figures, including bigwigs controlling certain central departments, big military leaders, big academic leaders, and big spies, as well as his followers placed in various localities, a group of big and small lackeys, serving as the core forces for carrying out the counter-revolutionary coup. He imitates Khrushchev, advocating that "engineers should become factory directors," instructing to "find some technically knowledgeable people to do this work," attempting to place his large number of confidants and ghosts and monsters in various leadership positions, stuffing them into the party's key departments.

Thus, "busy all year round, working hard, wholeheartedly" "painstakingly managing," the top capitalist-roader in the party thought everything was ready, waiting to realize his dream of restoring capitalism.

However, in the face of the heroic people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this can only be a daytime dream!

Under the personal initiation and leadership of our great commander Chairman Mao, hundreds of millions of people have organized a vast proletarian revolutionary rebel army, smashing the fierce attacks launched by the top capitalist-roader in the party and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the political, economic, and cultural fields, thoroughly smashing the great counter-revolutionary coup plot of the Chinese Khrushchev to seize the party, the army, and the country.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao provides extremely rich experience for the struggle between seizing power and counter-seizing power under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and for preventing counter-revolutionary coups in proletarian dictatorship states. The October Revolution first created the experience of the proletariat seizing power, while China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution created the experience of the proletariat consolidating power and preventing the bourgeoisie from counter-seizing power. This is a revolution with a more magnificent scale and deeper significance than the Paris Commune and the October Revolution. It tells us that to prevent counter-revolutionary coups, the proletariat must firmly grasp the gun, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new stage of launching a general offensive against the top capitalist-roader in the party. In this decisive battle, we proletarian revolutionary fighters must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the biggest group of capitalist-roaders in the party, and build China into a new China bathed in the boundless sun of Mao Zedong Thought!

    无产阶级专政下的政变与反政变的斗争
    ——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为什么要庇护反动影片《清宫秘史》
    罗思鼎
    一
    反动影片《清宫秘史》歌颂的是十九世纪末资产阶级维新党人所发动的一次流产了的“宫廷”政变。
    在十九世纪九十年代末，义和团运动正在蓬勃兴起，清王朝摇摇欲坠，眼看快要保不住了。就在这时，地主头子光绪纠集了康有为、梁启超这批保皇党，幻想依赖帝国主义的力量，在不触动封建根基的前提下，进行一些枝枝节节的所谓“改革”，其目的是为了扑灭已经燃烧起来的群众运动的革命烈火。
    以光绪为首的维新派的改良运动，遭到了以慈禧为首的守旧派的反对。这样，在封建统治阶级的内部，展开了一场夺权与反夺权的激烈的斗争。但是，西太后、荣禄一伙守旧派也罢，光绪、康有为一伙维新派也罢，不管他们采取怎样的手段和策略，他们都想借助帝国主义的力量，把起来向他们夺权的轰轰烈烈的义和团运动镇压下去，以维持他们的统治地位。“宁赠友邦，不与家奴”，就是他们共同的卖国心理。
    光绪所要走的道路，实质上同慈禧一样，是一条卖国的道路。即使光绪政变成功了，其前景也只能是一个卖国的儿皇帝的前景。《清宫秘史》大力歌颂和美化这样一条道路，正说明了它是一部彻底的卖国主义的影片。
    一九五○年三月，当这部影片刚在全国各地放映时，毛主席就严正指出：《清宫秘史》是一部卖国主义的影片，应该进行批判。
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派竟公然与毛主席对抗，胡说这部卖国主义影片“是爱国主义的”。
    一九五四年十月，毛主席再一次严厉指出：被人称为爱国主义影片而实际是卖国主义影片的《清宫秘史》，在全国放映之后，至今没有被批判。
    但是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派贼胆包天，继续别有用心地吹捧资产阶级的“维新变法”运动。就在他的纵容与指使下，类似《清宫秘史》这样的反动剧目竟在解放了的中国走起红运来了。一九五四年，越剧《光绪与珍妃》首先粉墨登场。接着，话剧、沪剧、扬剧、方言话剧等各剧种也纷纷在上海、南京、杭州、东北各地的舞台上演出了这出“政变”戏。一九五七年，北京又演出了话剧《清宫怨》（反动电影《清宫秘史》的蓝本），且被作为观摩剧目向各地介绍。直到一九六二年，北京还上演过京剧《珍妃》。
    一九六五年十二月，即姚文元同志《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》发表后的一个月，已经可以听见无产阶级文化大革命的汹涌澎湃的潮声了。就在这时，毛主席第三次严正指出：《清宫秘史》，有人说是爱国主义的，我看是卖国主义的，彻底的卖国主义。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派竟仍然企图作垂死前的挣扎。他匆匆忙忙地纠集了手下的大党阀彭真，炮制了反动的“二月提纲”，妄图在“纯学术讨论”的烟幕下，来阻挡这场不可阻挡的、将要葬送一切牛鬼蛇神的无产阶级文化大革命的浪潮。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为什么要这样尽心竭力地庇护《清宫秘史》这部反动的卖国主义影片？为什么要一而再、再而三地抗拒和抵制毛主席关于批判这部反动影片的英明指示？又为什么要这样地“可怜”光绪这个连章太炎都蔑称之为“载湉小丑”的地主阶级大头子？这些问题，长期以来都是个谜。
    戚本禹同志文章的发表，终于把谜底给揭穿了。这些问题，归根到底是个资产阶级夺权与无产阶级反夺权的问题。
    一九四九年，中国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，取得了民主革命的伟大胜利。中国的无产阶级夺取了政权，但是，资产阶级却并不甘心。他们要抢桃子，要篡夺胜利的果实。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是代表资产阶级向无产阶级抢桃子的最大的政治扒手。
    资产阶级在无产阶级专政条件下所进行的夺权斗争，有时是勾结帝国主义从外部实行武装干涉，但更多的却是通过资产阶级在共产党内的代表人物，特别是钻到党的领导机关内部的代表人物，进行和平演变。和平演变是一种极为隐蔽的夺权方式。它往往使人们在不知不觉之中，舒舒服服地过渡到了修正主义。但是，事物总是从渐变向突变发展的。和平演变到了一定时候，就会发展为“宫廷”政变或并不“和平”的武装政变。一九五五年，现代修正主义的头子赫鲁晓夫就是经过长期阴谋策划而最后实现“宫廷”政变的。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派是颇懂得其中奥妙的。“心有灵犀一点通”，他和影片中的光绪同病相怜，古今相通。一个光绪说：“大权不在我手中”。另一个“光绪”说：“黄金荣老了，主动地把坐位让给了蒋介石。”死人活人都是一个念头：夺权，夺权；政变，政变。因此，对于党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派来说，庇护反动影片《清宫秘史》，决不只是庇护一部电影的问题，而是一个坚持反动立场、妄图搞反革命政变阴谋的大问题。事实上，对历史或艺术上的光绪和珍妃的批判，必然会导致对现实生活中的“光绪”与“珍妃”的否定。对反动影片《清宫秘史》的批判一展开，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及一小撮修正主义分子梦想资本主义复辟的反革命嘴脸，也就暴露在光天化日之下了。
    去年五月，毛主席指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这样一个睡在我们的身边、时时都在谋划夺取政权的修正主义的总代表。
    二
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派要搞反革命政变，必须准备必要的条件，这就是要推行一条压制人民群众革命精神、镇压革命群众运动的资产阶级反动路线。
    路线问题，也就是依靠什么人、团结什么人、反对什么人的问题。无论在夺取政权的时候，或者巩固政权的时候，都存在着这个问题：依靠谁来夺权、掌权、用权？利用政权支持谁，保护谁，反对谁，镇压谁？路线问题，归根到底，是对待人民群众的态度问题，对待群众运动的态度问题。对人民群众和群众运动采取什么态度，是支持还是反对，这是区别革命和反革命的一个极为重要的标志。
    不同的路线，引导到不同的结果。信任群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众首创精神，支持革命群众运动，这是无产阶级革命路线。贯彻这条路线，必然引导到人民革命的胜利，引导到社会主义和共产主义。反其道而行之，依靠少数剥削阶级，压制和愚弄广大革命群众，镇压革命的群众运动，这是资产阶级反动路线。沿着这条路线走下去，其结果只能使无产阶级已经拿到手的政权重新丧失，使资本主义得以复辟。因此，资产阶级反动路线，实质上是一条颠覆无产阶级专政，实现反革命政变的路线。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，十七年来一贯推行的资产阶级反动路线，就是为他实现反革命政变的迷梦服务的。他阴谋通过这条反动路线，在群众头脑里套上一副沉重的精神枷锁，使广大群众成为“阿斗”，盲目地跟着他去复辟资本主义；并在他实现反革命政变以后，不敢起来造反。
    反动影片《清宫秘史》所体现的政治路线，正中这个大阴谋家的下怀。影片提出了一条完整的彻底的卖国路线，这就是：依靠帝国主义和带有资产阶级色彩的封建地主阶级及其知识分子，镇压人民革命运动，把中国变为半封建半殖民地社会。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所推行的资产阶级反动路线，正是影片中的卖国路线在新的历史条件下的翻版，它们有着共同的政治目标。
    反动影片《清宫秘史》的真正主角，是没有出场的帝国主义，它是光绪等人进行维新变法和实行政变的后台。影片通过帝国主义代理人珍妃之口声明，帝国主义“会帮助皇上恢复皇位，重振朝纲”。同时，影片大肆吹捧翁同龢、康有为等带有某种资产阶级色彩的封建知识分子，亦即所谓“新派”人物，想依靠他们，通过自上而下实行维新变法的办法，巧妙地保存封建势力，巩固封建主义的政权。
    影片对待人民群众的态度又是怎样呢？当时代表广大劳动人民利益的义和团，实质上正是光绪等人反夺权的对象。影片疯狂地污蔑这个伟大的革命群众运动，歌颂帝国主义的屠杀政策，借以说明政权决不能落到这群“暴民”手中。
    林彪同志说：“革命的群众运动，它天然是合理的，尽管群众中有个别的部分、个别的人，有‘左’有右的偏差，但是群众运动的主流总是适合社会的发展的，总是合理的。”七十多年前的义和团运动，完全证实了这个真理。千千万万的革命的农民群众在这个运动中，不怕天，不怕地，不怕洋人，不怕官。他们头戴红帽，腰缠红带，刀裹红布，结成了一支浩浩荡荡的革命造反大军。廊房一战，天津火车站一战，把侵略军打得落花流水。沿路上，义和团还大造地主官僚和洋奴买办的反，抄了他们的家，把他们一个个打翻在地。对于人民群众，他们却又纪律严明，秋毫无犯。他们敌友分明，矛头直接指向帝国主义和封建主义。他们的大方向始终是正确的。
    但是，在影片中，在古代的光绪和当今的“光绪”的眼中，人民群众具有两方面的特点：一方面，他们是“暴民”，是一群杀人放火、邪术妖法、“非人非鬼”的“疯魔”。另一方面，他们又是“无知愚民”。影片借翁同龢之口说：“老百姓是最听话的，也是最容易满足的”。完全抹杀了人民群众的革命性，真是恶毒之极。
    对待影片中义和团运动的态度，就是对待现实政治生活中革命群众运动的态度。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派以及一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在今天的文化大革命中，不也是一方面把革命小将污蔑为“暴徒”、“野蛮人”；另一方面又把革命群众看作“是听话的”“阿斗”吗？如果不是出于共同的阶级立场，怎么可能出现这样的一致呢？
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了准备反革命复辟，顽固地推行一条资产阶级反动路线，极端仇视广大革命群众，疯狂镇压革命群众运动。一九五五年，我国对农业、手工业、私人资本主义工商业的社会主义改造逐步进入高潮，广大工农群众起来坚决走社会主义道路。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派却跳出来横加阻挠，指使一个老右倾机会主义分子“坚决收缩”农业合作化运动。一九五八年，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，出现了轰轰烈烈的大跃进和人民公社运动。这个规模宏伟的群众运动，使“过去的剥削阶级完全陷落在劳动群众的汪洋大海中”。这又引起了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派极度不满。此后，当一九六二年国家遭受暂时困难的时候，他自己又赤膊上阵，把他在一九五八年想说而没有敢说的话全部发泄出来。他污蔑当时的群众运动是“一轰而起”，污蔑大跃进“好象一个人害了一场大病”，是“一团漆黑”。一九六四年我国开展了社会主义教育运动。这个运动，开始触及党内头号走资本主义道路当权派进行反革命政变的社会基础。他感觉到冬天的威胁，于是一反常态，突然以“左”的面貌出现，执行一条形“左”实右的机会主义路线，把斗争的矛头转移到绝大多数干部身上，转移到群众身上，以保护一小撮修正主义分子。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派预感到他的末日到了，他又一次急急忙忙地祭起了资产阶级反动路线的破旗，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖，自以为得意，长资产阶级的威风，灭无产阶级的志气，又何其毒也！
    他自我辩解说，他犯了路线错误，是因为“不理解”，因为“错误估计形势”，完全是一派胡言！他很理解，估计得很正确！凭借着几十年的反革命经验，他知道，这是一场革他的命、粉碎他的反革命政变幻梦的革命。他孤注一掷，进行绝望的挣扎，妄想滑过去，继续搞他的政变阴谋。但是，他这一切表演，更彻底地暴露了他的反革命面目，更加速了以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线的最后崩溃，更加促进了无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派所推行的资产阶级反动路线，是我党历史上一条最长、最粗的右倾机会主义即修正主义黑线。这条黑线，归根结底，是为了复辟资本主义。彻底批判资产阶级反动路线，肃清它的流毒，就是从根本上防止资本主义复辟，防止反革命政变！
    三
    在无产阶级专政条件下实行反革命政变，很重要的一条是要推行和平演变。只有预先从各个方面腐蚀人们的思想，瓦解社会主义制度，从思想上、制度上、组织上为反革命政变做好准备，最后才能实现政变。苏联党和国家改变颜色的惨痛教训，充分证实了这一点。
    反动影片《清宫秘史》宣扬了一些什么东西呢？它竭力鼓吹“变法维新”，鼓吹所谓“新政”。它鼓吹向西方学习，走西方资产阶级的老路，搞资本主义。在十九世纪末二十世纪初，这已经是一种根本不切实际的幻想。把这一套“新政”再搬到二十世纪中叶的社会主义国家里来加以宣扬，就只能是鼓吹从社会主义向资本主义和平演变。所谓“新政”云云，其实就是和平演变的黑话。反动影片《清宫秘史》，就是资产阶级共和国的招魂幡，就是为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的工具。
    光绪、康有为的“新政”，究竟有些什么内容呢？康有为自己曾作了概括的表述：大誓群臣以定国是，设“上书所”以广言路，开“制度局”以定新制，立“对策所”以征贤才。也就是说，所谓“新政”的主要内容，不外乎造舆论、改制度、搞队伍这样三个方面。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派在社会主义土地上执行所谓“新政”或“新法制”，也不外乎这三个方面。
    首先是造舆论。
    毛主席教导我们：凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。赫鲁晓夫在上台以前，首先就是让资产阶级意识形态自由泛滥，积极制造各种反革命舆论。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派走的也是这条路。十七年来，他大抓笔杆子，搞理论，搞学术，搞文艺，在思想文化战线的各个领域中，大肆放毒，为反革命政变进行舆论准备。
    他通过反革命修正主义分子杨献珍抛出“合二而一”论，公开宣扬取消阶级斗争，宣扬阶级调和论。他一贯宣扬“两个相反的东西，结合成一个新的东西”。他是最大的“合二而一”论者，是“合二而一”论的祖师爷。他通过他的走卒孙冶方等反革命修正主义分子，鼓吹物质刺激，钞票挂帅。他是反革命文艺黑线的总根子。在他的庇护和支持下，十七年来文艺界以周扬为首的一批反革命修正主义分子，疯狂地反对毛主席的文艺思想和文艺路线，把文艺界绝大多数领导机构变为资产阶级专政的工具，变为裴多菲俱乐部。他指使一批资产阶级反动学术“权威”在史学界大做“翻案”文章，篡改党史，明目张胆地为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。他还是资产阶级教育路线的最大倡导者。他极力反对毛主席提出的教育方针，鼓吹修正主义的两种教育制度，两种劳动制度，妄图把学校作为复辟资本主义的社会支柱。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派的这一切反革命言行，集中到一点，就是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。他丧心病狂地把矛头直接指向我们伟大的领袖毛主席，指向战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他挥舞起“简单化”、“庸俗化”的大棒，污蔑广大工农兵群众活学活用毛主席著作。他否认毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。他含沙射影地恶毒攻击毛主席，说什么：“中国还没有斯大林，只有靠我们来工作”；“官越大，真理越少”；“凡是自称领袖……决不能成为领袖”。他反对学习毛主席著作，说什么我们应该“向党内党外群众中一切有真理的人学习……不是向职位高的人学习”。他借口“作马克思列宁的好学生”，反对林彪同志提出的“做毛主席的好学生”。他还公开庇护反动标语“拥护党中央、反对毛主席”。他要的是一个什么样的“党中央”，他想干什么，不是很清楚了吗？他不就是睡在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫吗？敌人如此张牙舞爪，我们难道能视而不见吗？
    其次是改制度。
    社会主义时期，是从资本主义向共产主义过渡的历史时期，是共产主义因素逐步增长、资本主义因素逐步消亡的时期。赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义，对于那些资本主义势力不但不进行认真的社会主义改造，反而千方百计地加以发展，并且竭力瓦解社会主义制度，使它逐步蜕化为资本主义。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，亦步亦趋，跟得很紧。他随时都在窥测空隙，等待时机，力图保存和扩大资本主义阵地。特别是三年暂时困难期间，他以为时机已经成熟了，于是他伙同他手下那一小撮反革命修正主义分子，配合国际上帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派所掀起的反华浪潮，加紧步伐，抛出了一整套复辟资本主义的反革命修正主义纲领。
    在工业战线上，鼓吹“用经济方法管理经济”，向资本主义经营方法学习，宣扬利润挂帅、技术第一，反对党的领导，反对突出无产阶级政治，妄图使社会主义工矿企业蜕化为资本主义企业。
    在农业战线上，疯狂攻击人民公社“办早了”、“办糟了”，大刮“单干风”，大力鼓吹“三自一包”，妄图瓦解社会主义的集体经济，使社会主义的合作化农业退回到资本主义的个体经济去。
    在财贸战线上，大力提倡自由市场，自产自销，大搞高档、高价商品，扩大差别，盲目追求商业利润，缩小和削弱社会主义阵地。
    在科学技术领域里，宣扬技术决定一切，鼓吹个人奋斗的白专道路，大力培养新的科学技术贵族，妄图使科技界成为资产阶级知识分子的王国。
    在文艺领域里，大反毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务、文艺工作者与工农兵相结合的方针，鼓吹三高（高工资、高稿酬、高奖金），提倡资产阶级自由化，鼓励大批反党反社会主义的毒草出笼，为资本主义复辟大造舆论。
    在教育方面，鼓吹知识第一、分数第一，积极贩卖资本主义的“双轨教育制度”，强调教授治校，使资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象长期继续下去，妄图把我们的下一代培养成为资产阶级的接班人。
    在党的工作中，抛出了经过精心修改的修正主义篡党纲领《修养》，反对阶级斗争，反对无产阶级专政，反对毛泽东思想，宣扬奴隶主义、个人主义、唯心主义，妄图毒害广大党员群众，使他们成为盲目跟着他去复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。
    最后是搞队伍。
    政治路线决定组织路线。做什么样的事情，要靠什么样的人。搞资本主义复辟，正象当年赫鲁晓夫所作的一样，只能网罗一批地、富、反、坏、右。多年以来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，为了搞反革命政变，背着毛主席，背着党中央，到处招兵买马，招降纳叛。他有“三家村”那样的急先锋，也有“四家店”那样的干将。他拼凑了一批康有为、袁世凯之流的人物，有控制中央某些部门大权的大党阀、大军阀、大学阀、大特务，也有安置在各个地方的党羽，一群大小娄罗，充当搞反革命政变的基干队伍。他仿效赫鲁晓夫，鼓吹“工程师出身的人去当厂长”，“指示”“要找一些懂技术的人来做这个工作”，妄想把他的大批亲信、大量牛鬼蛇神安插到各个领导岗位上，塞进党的机要部门。
    就这样，“一年忙到头，辛辛苦苦，一心一意”地“惨澹经营”，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派自以为万事具备，等着做他复辟资本主义的黄粱美梦了。
    但是，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人民面前，这只能是白日做梦！
    在我们伟大统帅毛主席的亲自发动和率领下，亿万人民组织起一支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命造反大军，正在粉碎党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派及一小撮反革命修正主义分子在政治、经济、文化等各领域内所发动的猖狂进攻，彻底粉碎中国的赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡军、篡国的反革命政变大阴谋。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命，对于无产阶级专政条件下的夺权与反夺权的斗争，对于防止无产阶级专政国家的反革命政变，提供了极其丰富的经验。十月革命第一次创造了无产阶级夺取政权的经验，我国的无产阶级文化大革命，则创造了无产阶级巩固政权，防止资产阶级反夺权的经验。这是一场比巴黎公社、十月革命规模更宏伟、意义更深远的革命。它告诉了我们，要防止反革命政变，无产阶级就必须牢牢地紧握枪杆子，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗！
    目前，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，已经进入了一个对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派实行总攻击的新阶段。在这场决战中，我们无产阶级革命派战士要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，进一步在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，彻底批判和打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，将中国建设成为一个在光焰无际的毛泽东思想阳光下照耀着的新中国！
