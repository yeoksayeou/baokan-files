The proletarian revolutionary forces on the industrial front in Qingdao City have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They have closely linked the criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. This has further promoted revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, making the revolutionary and production situation increasingly better. After achieving a major victory in the first quarter by overfulfilling the state plan, the total industrial output value in April again overfulfilled the state plan by 7.6 percent, an increase of 22.9 percent over the same period last year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." The proletarian revolutionary forces in Qingdao City resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and in the great criticism, unite the majority to further promote the great unity of the revolutionary forces. Some units, through criticizing the "strike a large number, protect a small number" component of the bourgeois reactionary line, quickly awakened some deceived masses and erring cadres, making them recognize the evil plots of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Some units, through criticizing the fallacies such as "exploitation is beneficial" advocated by the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, further raised the class consciousness of the workers, making some originally conservative and neutral workers actively side with the revolutionary forces, strengthening the revolutionary forces, and further mobilizing all possible positive factors. After the revolutionary forces in the Qingdao Vehicle Factory seized power, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party manipulated conservative forces to counterattack the revolutionary masses, creating divisions among the people and seriously affecting production. In this great criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the deceived masses quickly awakened, and more than 90 percent of the revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in the entire factory united, caring for and supporting each other, and production soared. Some units also exposed and criticized the revisionist line of profit in command and material incentives pushed by the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, resolutely following the correct direction pointed out by Chairman Mao, breaking the old and establishing the new, gradually establishing a new revolutionary order, and effectively promoting the development of production.

In the great criticism, the broad proletarian revolutionary forces put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place, thoroughly criticized selfishness, and advocated selflessness. Many units saw a new trend of taking on heavy responsibilities and letting go of honors. When the Workers and Farmers Glass Factory encountered difficulties in basic construction, the proletarian revolutionary forces in the Qingdao Match Factory and Dongfeng Gelatin Factory immediately went to support them, solving their difficulties.

The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Qingdao actively responded to Chairman Mao's call, sending large numbers of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams into factories and enterprises, bringing the good thoughts, good styles, and good experiences of the PLA's emphasis on politics, adherence to the four firsts, and carrying forward the three-eighths style to the factories and enterprises, which had a great impact on the broad revolutionary workers. Revolutionary workers took the PLA as an example, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, voluntarily observed labor discipline, and greatly enhanced their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, significantly improving their combat effectiveness and promoting the development of the revolution and production.

    通过大批判进一步团结了革命力量和调动了积极因素
    青岛工业战线革命和生产形势越来越好
    第一季度生产取得重大胜利，四月份总产值又超额完成计划
    新华社济南九日电　青岛市工业战线的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，进一步促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，革命和生产的形势一片大好，而且越来越好。全市工业生产继第一季度取得超额完成国家计划的重大胜利后，四月份总产值又超额百分之七点六完成了国家计划，比去年同期提高百分之二十二点九。
    毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”青岛市无产阶级革命派坚决听毛主席的话，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，在革命的大批判中团结大多数，进一步促进了革命派的大联合。有的单位通过对“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线组成部分的批判，使一些受蒙蔽的群众和犯错误的干部迅速觉悟过来，更加认清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶阴谋，大杀回马枪。有的单位通过对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所鼓吹的“剥削有功”等谬论的批判，进一步提高了职工的阶级觉悟，使一些原来比较保守和持中间态度的职工积极向革命派靠拢，壮大了革命派的队伍，进一步调动了一切可以调动的积极因素。青岛车辆厂革命派夺权以后，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵保守势力，向革命群众进行反扑，在群众中制造对立，使生产受到严重影响。在这次对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，受蒙蔽的群众迅速觉悟过来，全厂百分之九十以上的革命职工和革命干部团结起来，互相关怀，互相支持，生产直线上升。有些单位还揭发批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派推行的利润挂帅、物质刺激等修正主义路线，坚决按照毛主席指出的正确方向，破旧立新，逐步建立起革命的新秩序，有力地促进了生产的发展。
    在大批判中，广大无产阶级革命派把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，大破“私”字，大立“公”字。许多单位出现了见困难就上，见荣誉就让，勇于拣重担子挑的新风气。工农玻璃厂在基本建设中遇到了困难，青岛火柴厂、东风明胶厂等单位的无产阶级革命派立即去支援，解决了对方的困难。
    人民解放军驻青岛部队积极响应毛主席的号召，派出大批毛泽东思想宣传队深入工厂企业，把解放军突出政治、坚持四个第一、发扬三八作风的好思想、好作风、好经验带到工厂企业，在广大革命职工中产生了很大的影响。革命职工以解放军为榜样，活学活用毛主席著作，自觉遵守劳动纪律，革命性、科学性和组织纪律性大大增强，战斗力大大提高，推动了革命和生产的发展。（附图片）
