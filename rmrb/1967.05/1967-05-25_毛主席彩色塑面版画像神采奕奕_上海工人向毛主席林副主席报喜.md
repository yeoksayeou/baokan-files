In the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shanghai Victory Timber Factory and four other units successfully produced a color relief portrait of Chairman Mao. On the 23rd, representatives of the revolutionary masses and workers from these five units, carrying the boundless love of Shanghai's revolutionary masses for Chairman Mao, came to the offices of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission. They reported their success to our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and presented the portraits they had produced to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group.

Responsible officials from the Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Office of the Central Military Commission received the representatives who came to report their success. Representatives from revolutionary mass organizations of the State Forestry Department, Beijing Forestry College, and Nanjing Forestry College also participated in the reporting ceremony. When the representatives from Shanghai's revolutionary workers handed over the vibrant and radiant color relief portrait of Chairman Mao to the staff of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. Everyone enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!" "Learn from the revolutionary masses of Shanghai! Salute the revolutionary masses of Shanghai!"

The color relief portraits of Chairman Mao produced by Shanghai Victory Timber Factory, Shanghai Tobacco Company Printing Factory, Shanghai Mirror Wood Factory, Shanghai Light Industry Bureau, and Shanghai Timber Industry Company have a total of twenty sizes, with the largest being 2 meters high and 1.6 meters wide, and the smallest being the size of a "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" book. This set of portraits is a crystallization of the Shanghai revolutionary workers' boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and a crystallization of the workers' wisdom. The portraits are made by using plywood and titanium white paper as the base, placing resin film and color prints on the base, and then heat-pressing them. The portraits are sturdy, do not fade, are not affected by sun and rain, can withstand severe vibrations, and have vivid colors, appearing as smooth and bright as if framed in glass.

The revolutionary masses and workers of Shanghai Victory Timber Factory and the other four units have invested deep class feelings and gone through arduous struggles to produce the large-scale color relief portraits of Chairman Mao.

In the midst of the high tide of revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the revolutionary masses of Shanghai Victory Timber Factory saw how the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party hated Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought so much, and they felt extremely indignant. They said, "The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party fear Mao Zedong Thought and fear the revolutionary people's boundless love for Chairman Mao. We will produce even more, even larger, and even better color relief portraits of Chairman Mao, so that the revolutionary people can all see the radiant image of the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao."

The revolutionary workers, while denouncing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, accelerated the trial production process and finally succeeded.

    毛主席彩色塑面版画像神采奕奕
    上海工人向毛主席林副主席报喜
    据新华社二十四日讯  在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，上海胜利木材厂等五个单位的无产阶级革命派和革命职工试制成功了塑面版毛主席彩色画像。二十三日，这五个单位的无产阶级革命派代表，带着上海市广大革命职工对毛主席无限热爱的心情，来到中共中央和中央军委机关，向我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席报喜，并把他们试制成功的画像敬献给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席以及党中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组。
    中共中央办公厅和中央军委办公厅的负责人分别接见了前来报喜的代表。参加报喜仪式的还有林业部和北京林学院、南京林学院的革命群众组织代表。当上海革命工人代表们把神采奕奕、光艳夺目的塑面版毛主席彩色画像交给中共中央和中央军委机关工作人员的时候，全场掌声雷动，人们一致纵情高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“向上海无产阶级革命派学习！向上海无产阶级革命派致敬！”
    上海胜利木材厂、上海烟草公司印刷厂、上海镜木厂、上海轻工业局、上海木材工业公司五个单位试制成功的塑面版毛主席彩色画像，共有二十个规格，最大的高二米、宽一米六，最小的有《毛主席语录》本那样大。这套画像，是上海革命工人无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的崇高感情的结晶，也是工人们的智慧的结晶。画像是用胶合板和钛白纸作为衬底，把树脂薄膜和彩印画像放在衬底上，经过热压制成的。画像质地坚固，不退颜色，不怕日晒雨淋，不怕剧烈震动，画面色彩鲜明，好象镶在玻璃镜框里一样平滑、明亮。
    上海胜利木材厂等五单位的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，为制造巨幅塑面版毛主席彩色画像，倾注了最深厚的阶级感情，经历了艰难曲折的斗争。
    在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命大批判的高潮中，胜利木材厂的无产阶级革命派看到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派如此仇视伟大领袖毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，感到无比愤慨。他们说，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派害怕毛泽东思想，害怕革命人民无限热爱毛主席，我们就偏偏要生产出更多、更大、更好的塑面版毛主席彩色画像，让革命人民都能看到我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉形象。革命职工一面口诛笔伐党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一面加快试制进程，终于成功了。
