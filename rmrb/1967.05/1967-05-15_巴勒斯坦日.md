	Palestinian Day

	“Palestinian Day” (May 15th) is a day for the Palestinian people and other Arab peoples to oppose American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, and to struggle for national independence. It is also an important day for people around the world to support the just struggle of the Palestinian people.

	American imperialism is a vicious enemy of the Palestinian Arab people. After World War II, American imperialism further infiltrated the Middle East, attempting to use Palestine as an important base for invading Asia and Africa. In November 1947, the new and old colonialists, led by the United States, manipulated the United Nations to forcibly pass a resolution to establish the "State of Israel." On May 14, 1948, Zionists established an artificial "State of Israel" on Palestinian land. The next day, with the support of American and British imperialism, Israel launched an aggressive war against neighboring Arab countries, seizing 6,700 square kilometers of land and driving more than a million Arab people out of their homes, forcing them to become refugees in nearby Arab countries.

	For nineteen years, American imperialism has consistently supported Israel's policy of expansion and aggression, continually providing weapons to Israel and strengthening its military forces, threatening the peace and security of Arab countries. As recently as last February, the United States openly handed over 200 Patton tanks to Israel. The United States uses Israel as a dagger thrust into the Arab region, posing a huge threat to Arab countries.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership clique colludes with American imperialism on the Palestinian issue, playing the so-called "reconciliation" trick, and vigorously advocating the use of the "Tashkent spirit" to resolve disputes, actually betraying the interests of the Palestinian Arab people. At the fake "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" convened under the manipulation of the Soviet revisionists, they also tried to obstruct the conference from passing a resolution supporting the just struggle of the Palestinian people.

	The Palestinian people, in order to liberate their homeland, have long resisted oppression and deception, and have persistently struggled. The establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1964 marked a new stage in the struggle of the Palestinian people. Through long-term struggle, the Palestinian people have come to understand the truth pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." In 1965, the Palestinian people established their own liberation army and engaged in armed struggle against their formidable enemies equipped with modern weapons.

	The Chinese people are loyal friends of the Palestinian people. The Chinese people have always supported the just struggle of the Palestinian people and have always stood firmly on the side of the Palestinian people. In the course of the common struggle, the Chinese people and the Palestinian people have forged a deep friendship. The chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Shuqairi, said well: "We are not afraid of anyone slandering our friendship with China and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong; on the contrary, we are proud of our friendship with China and Mao Zedong."

### 巴勒斯坦日

    巴勒斯坦日
    “巴勒斯坦日”（五月十五日）是巴勒斯坦人民和其它阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列，争取民族独立的纪念日，也是世界各国人民声援巴勒斯坦人民正义斗争的重要日子。
    美帝国主义是巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的凶恶敌人。第二次世界大战后，美帝国主义进一步侵入中东，企图把巴勒斯坦作为侵略亚洲和非洲的重要基地。一九四七年十一月，以美国为首的新老殖民主义者操纵联合国强行通过关于建立“以色列国”的决议。一九四八年五月十四日，犹太复国主义者在巴勒斯坦的土地上建立了一个人为的“以色列国”。第二天，以色列在美英帝国主义的支持下向邻近的阿拉伯国家发动了侵略战争，侵占了土地六千七百平方公里，把巴勒斯坦土地上的一百多万阿拉伯人赶出自己的家园，使他们流落在附近的阿拉伯国家，沦为难民。
    十九年来，美帝国主义一贯支持以色列的扩张侵略政策，不断向以色列提供武器，加强它的武装力量，威胁阿拉伯各国的和平与安全。光是去年二月，美国就公开把二百辆巴顿式坦克交给以色列。美国把以色列作为它插入阿拉伯地区的一把尖刀，对阿拉伯各国造成巨大威胁。
    苏联修正主义领导集团在巴勒斯坦问题上同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，玩弄所谓“和解”阴谋，大肆鼓吹用“塔什干精神”来解决争端，实际上是在出卖巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的利益。在苏修操纵下召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”上，还竭力阻挠会议通过支持巴勒斯坦人民正义斗争的决议。
    巴勒斯坦人民为了解放自己的家园，不畏强暴，不受欺骗，长期坚持斗争。一九六四年巴勒斯坦解放组织的成立标志着巴勒斯坦人民的斗争进入一个新阶段。从长期的斗争中，巴勒斯坦人民认识到伟大领袖毛主席指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的真理。一九六五年，巴勒斯坦人民又建立了自己的解放军，面对以现代化武器装备起来的凶恶敌人进行了针锋相对的武装斗争。
    中国人民是巴勒斯坦人民的忠实朋友。中国人民一向支持巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，一向坚定地站在巴勒斯坦人民一边，在共同的斗争中，中国人民和巴勒斯坦人民结成了深厚的战斗友谊。巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里说得好：“我们不怕有人诽谤我们同中国和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的友谊，相反，我们为自己同中国和毛泽东的友谊而感到自豪。”（新华社）（附图片）
