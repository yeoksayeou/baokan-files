Left-wing Trade Unions in Malaya Hold Joint Celebration of May Day

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 2nd, a message from Singapore stated that on April 30, twelve left-wing trade unions in Malaya jointly held a celebration for May Day, the International Labor Day, with 500 worker representatives in attendance. The meeting passed a resolution strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' aggression against Vietnam and their brutal massacre of the Vietnamese people, and expressed resolute support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

The meeting also passed resolutions supporting the struggles of the peoples of Asia and Africa against imperialism, colonialism, and Soviet modern revisionism; severely condemning the bloody persecution of progressive individuals and the frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese fascist atrocities committed by the reactionary government of Indonesia; resolutely supporting the struggle of the people of North Kalimantan for national independence; and condemning the brutal suppression of the rubber workers' strike by the reactionary authorities of "Malaysia."

In his speech, the chairman of the meeting pointed out that the workers' movement in various parts of Malaya is combining economic struggles with political struggles to push the workers' movement in Malaya to a new high.
