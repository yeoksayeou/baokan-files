	Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: The People's Liberation Army Air Force today, in the afternoon, shot down two U.S. imperialist A-4B attack aircraft that intruded into our airspace to provoke war in a certain location in Guangxi.

	In the past eight days, our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force has shot down a total of five U.S. imperialist military aircraft that intruded into our airspace. This is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: The Central Military Commission today issued a commendation order, praising the People's Liberation Army Air Force for shooting down two U.S. imperialist A-4B attack aircraft in a certain location in Guangxi. The commendation order states that this battle was fought well, fiercely, and decisively, achieving another major victory in the past eight days. This victory is a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and a great victory for the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	The commendation order points out that at a time when the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of laboring people in our country, with boundless excitement, are celebrating the "May Day" International Labor Day together with the revolutionary people of the world and rejoicing in the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, you have continuously won battles and reported victories. This greatly boosts the morale of the revolutionary people, greatly dampens the arrogance of U.S. imperialism, and is a great encouragement to the revolutionary factions across the country. It is also a powerful support for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. Therefore, a special commendation is issued, and the warmest congratulations are extended to all the combatants who participated in the battle.

	The commendation order states that recently, while the U.S. imperialists have been escalating their bombing of North Vietnam, they have also repeatedly sent military aircraft to intrude into our airspace. This is a deliberate act of war provocation, and we must be highly vigilant and take it seriously. It is hoped that you will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, carry out a thorough ideological revolution, summarize experiences, continue your efforts, remain humble, and maintain the spirit of bravery, selflessness, endurance, and continuous combat to achieve new and greater victories.
