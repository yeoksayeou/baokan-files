Over the past few days, the Hong Kong British authorities have continued to deploy large numbers of police and spies, brazenly carrying out bloody suppression and persecution against our compatriots in Hong Kong. A large number of Hong Kong compatriots have been illegally arrested, secretly interrogated, tortured, and unjustly sentenced. The number of casualties, arrests, and missing persons has already exceeded a thousand. On May 22, the Hong Kong British authorities again sent out a large number of police and "riot control teams," creating a new bloody incident. Hundreds of our compatriots and personnel from our institutions in Hong Kong were injured and unjustly arrested. Hong Kong has become a world of terror.

The "May 22" bloody incident, like the "May 6" and "May 11" massacres, were all meticulously planned and deliberately created by British imperialism. On May 17, the British Commonwealth Office, disregarding the stern protest of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement, openly supporting the Hong Kong British authorities' bloody suppression of Chinese compatriots and encouraging them to continue their reckless actions. On May 19, British Foreign Secretary Brown, when meeting with our acting charge d'affaires in the UK, openly ranted and maliciously slandered the Chinese people's just actions in supporting Hong Kong compatriots. On May 21, the British government sent high-ranking officials to Hong Kong to plot further suppression of Hong Kong Chinese workers and residents. The "May 22" serious bloody incident was created under this background. The British government and the Hong Kong British authorities will not be able to deny this.

The Hong Kong British authorities' bloody persecution of Chinese compatriots is nothing short of fascist atrocities. However, British imperialism still refuses to admit it. British Foreign Secretary Brown, upon hearing the words "fascist atrocities," becomes hysterical. Let me ask Brown, what are you shouting about? You deploy thousands of police and "riot control teams," use helicopters and tear gas to suppress unarmed Chinese residents. Isn't this fascist atrocity? You beat and arrest Chinese workers, students, and journalists on the streets, and even ten-year-old children are brutally harmed. Isn't this fascist atrocity? You send out a large number of spies and secret agents to illegally kidnap our patriotic compatriots, secretly interrogate, and torture them. Isn't all of this a thorough fascist atrocity?

Not only that. Brown even dares to protest against our people's just actions in condemning the Hong Kong British authorities' fascist atrocities. Shut up! You kill, arrest, illegally interrogate, and cruelly persecute our Hong Kong compatriots, not only do you not admit your crimes, but you also counterattack. You are too arrogant! Do you still want to dream of the opium war era in the 1960s?

It must be pointed out that the British government is currently playing with fire in Hong Kong. After our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a protest statement on May 15 regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' persecution of our patriotic compatriots, the British government not only did not accept our government's stern demands but also deliberately escalated the situation, instructing the Hong Kong British authorities to further suppress and persecute our patriotic compatriots. This shows that the British government is stubborn and insists on being an enemy of the four million Hong Kong Chinese compatriots and the seven hundred million Chinese people.

Blood debts must be repaid. Over a century, how much blood debt has British imperialism owed to the Chinese people? Old and new grievances, the Chinese people remember them one by one. The day of settling accounts with British imperialism will surely come.

The Chinese people have been fighting against British imperialism for over a century and have long seen through the decaying imperialist's bully-soft, cowardly, and paper tiger nature. When the Chinese people's revolution was on the verge of victory, a million heroes crossed the Yangtze River, and British imperialists jumped out, attempting to block the way. At that time, we gave this old imperialist a small but deserved lesson. Today, when the great proletarian cultural revolution is surging, seven hundred million Chinese people are further armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are rapidly advancing on the revolutionary road. This old imperialist is playing with fire again, repeatedly provoking the Chinese people, and will only end up with a bloody nose!

The Hong Kong compatriots have a glorious revolutionary fighting tradition. The 1925 Hong Kong workers' strike once shook the then-invincible British imperialism. Today, under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have stood up like giants. Facing the Hong Kong British authorities' savage fascist atrocities, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots have bravely launched a powerful struggle against persecution, adding a new glorious chapter to the epic of the Chinese nation's anti-imperialist struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is impossible to hope to persuade imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have good intentions and turn back. The only way is to organize forces to fight against them." The stubborn attitude of British imperialism once again proves this truth. Now, the political awareness of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots has reached an unprecedented height. They further organize themselves and establish the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Compatriots' Committee Against British Persecution." Brave Hong Kong patriotic compatriots solemnly declare that they will fight to the end with British imperialism and will not stop until victory is achieved. Under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots' just struggle will surely achieve victory.

Hong Kong patriotic compatriots are our flesh and blood. British imperialism's arbitrary suppression and persecution of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots are absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The seven hundred million Chinese people, who are successfully carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are the strong backing of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots. We must sternly warn British imperialism: you must unconditionally accept the five demands of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the four demands of the Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. If you dare to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end, you will not have a good outcome!

    英帝国主义在玩火
    本报评论员
    连日来，港英当局继续出动大量警察特务，肆无忌惮地对我香港爱国同胞进行血腥镇压和迫害，又有大批港九爱国同胞遭到非法逮捕、秘密审讯、严刑拷打和无理判刑。死伤、被捕、失踪者已上千人。二十二日，港英当局又派出大批警察和“防暴队”，制造了新的流血事件，我数百名同胞和我驻港机构人员被打伤，被无理逮捕。香港已成为一个恐怖世界。
    “五·二二”流血事件，同“五·六”、“五·一一”血案一样，都是英帝国主义精心策划、蓄意制造的。五月十七日，英国联邦事务部不顾我国外交部的严正抗议，发表声明，公然支持港英当局对中国同胞的血腥镇压，并且鼓励港英当局继续蛮干下去。五月十九日，英国外交大臣布朗在会见我驻英临时代办时，公然大放厥词，恶毒诬蔑中国人民声援港九爱国同胞的正义行动。五月二十一日，英国政府又派出高级官员去香港，策划进一步镇压香港中国工人和居民的罪恶活动。“五·二二”严重流血事件就是在这种背景下制造出来的。英国政府和港英当局想要抵赖是绝对办不到的。
    香港英国当局对中国同胞的血腥迫害，是不折不扣的法西斯暴行。但是英帝国主义还死不认账，英国外交大臣布朗一听见“法西斯暴行”这几个字，就象揭了他的烂疮疤，歇斯底里大发作。试问布朗，你叫嚷些什么？你们出动数千名的警察、“防暴队”，使用直升飞机、催泪弹，镇压赤手空拳的中国居民，难道这不是法西斯暴行吗？你们在大街小巷毒打和逮捕中国工人、学生、新闻工作者，甚至连十岁的儿童也惨遭毒手，难道这不是法西斯暴行吗？你们派出大批密探特务，非法绑架我爱国同胞，秘密审讯，严刑拷打，难道这一切不正是彻头彻尾的法西斯暴行吗？
    不仅如此。布朗居然还对我国人民声讨港英当局法西斯暴行的正义行动，提出什么“抗议”。住嘴！你们杀害、逮捕、非法审讯和残酷地迫害我香港同胞，不仅不低头认罪，反而进行反扑。你们太不自量了！难道在二十世纪六十年代的今天，你们还想做鸦片战争旧时代的黄粱美梦吗？
    必须严正指出，英国政府目前正在香港玩火。在我国外交部五月十五日就港英当局迫害我爱国同胞事件发表抗议声明以后，英国政府不仅没有接受我国政府的严正要求，反而蓄意扩大事态，变本加厉地指使港英当局加紧镇压和迫害我爱国同胞。这表明英国政府顽固不化，坚持同四百万香港中国同胞为敌，同七亿中国人民为敌。
    血债是必须要偿还的。一个多世纪以来，英帝国主义对中国人民欠下的血债难道还少吗？旧仇新恨，中国人民都一笔一笔地牢记着。向英帝国主义进行总清算的日子，是一定要到来的。
    中国人民同英帝国主义进行了一个多世纪的斗争，早就看透了这个衰朽的帝国主义欺软怕硬、色厉内荏的纸老虎本质。当着中国人民革命胜利前夕，百万雄师过大江的时候，英帝国主义者跳了出来，妄图螳臂挡车。那个时候，我们曾经给了这个老牌帝国主义一个小小的然而是应有的教训。今天，当着中国无产阶级文化大革命的怒潮汹涌澎湃，七亿中国人民进一步地用毛泽东思想武装起来，在革命的路上迅跑的时候，这个老牌帝国主义又要玩火，一再向中国人民挑衅，只会碰得头破血流！
    港九同胞是富有光荣的革命斗争传统的。一九二五年的香港工人大罢工，就曾震撼过当时不可一世的英帝国主义。今天，中国人民在我们伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，已经象巨人一样地站立了起来。港九爱国同胞面对着港英当局的野蛮的法西斯暴行，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，英勇地展开了声势浩大的反迫害斗争，为中华民族的反帝斗争的史诗又写下了新的光辉的一章。
    毛主席教导我们：“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。英帝国主义的顽劣态度，又一次证明了这个真理。现在，香港爱国同胞的政治觉悟空前提高，他们进一步组织起来，成立了“港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会”。英勇的香港爱国同胞庄严宣布，誓同英帝国主义斗争到底，不获胜利，决不收兵。在伟大的毛泽东思想的指引下，香港爱国同胞的正义斗争，是一定要取得胜利的。
    香港爱国同胞是我们的亲骨肉，英帝国主义这样肆意镇压和迫害香港中国同胞，这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。正在胜利地进行着无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，是香港爱国同胞的强大后盾。我们要严厉警告英帝国主义，你们必须无条件地接受我国外交部的五点要求和港九各界同胞的四项要求。你们要是胆敢和中国人民为敌到底，你们绝不会有好下场！
