The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is playing a treacherous game of fake support and real betrayal against the just struggle of the Palestinian people. At the same time, it is colluding with the common enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, to protect U.S. imperialism's tool of aggression in the Middle East, Israel. The Soviet revisionists' treacherous behavior on the Palestinian issue is facing increasing opposition from the awakening Palestinian people.

Nineteen years ago, on May 14, U.S. imperialism created Israel, a dagger plunged into the back of the Arab people. The next day, on May 15, Israel launched a large-scale war of aggression against the surrounding Arab countries, seizing over 6,000 square kilometers of land and driving more than a million Palestinian Arabs from their homes. From that day on, the U.S. aggressors openly positioned themselves as enemies of the entire Arab people, tightening a new noose around their necks.

For nineteen years, the Palestinian Arab people have been steadfast in their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, demanding the right to return to their homeland. Their struggle has grown stronger. Since 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization and its army have been established. However, as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has never supported the struggle of the Palestinian people but has instead protected Israel. As the Palestinian people's struggle has flourished, the Soviet revisionists have intensified their game of fake support and real betrayal.

To this day, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique still recognizes Israel, the U.S. tool of aggression, and is "improving" its relations with it. The Israeli flag, stained with the blood of Palestinian Arabs, can fly over Moscow. The Israeli "ambassador" openly becomes a guest of the Kremlin. Last April, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban on further developing relations. According to Abba Eban, Israel is very satisfied with the "approach" between the two countries. He proudly announced: "Last year, we strengthened our diplomatic, commercial, and cultural relations with some Eastern European countries."

Moreover, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique has been continually sending large numbers of Soviet Jews to settle in Israel. Statistics show that in the past ten years, out of the more than 400,000 Jews who migrated to Israel from other regions, the majority came from the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. A Palestinian friend pointed out bluntly: "In Israel, the U.S. provides the guns, the Soviet Union provides the people; the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Israel are all partners against the Palestinian people."

According to a recent revelation by the British weekly *The Economist*, trade between the Soviet Union and Israel has grown significantly in recent years. In the first eleven months of 1966, the total value of goods imported by the Soviet Union from Israel reached $1.9 million, four times the amount of the same period in 1965. In addition, the Soviet Union has conducted extensive economic exchanges with Israel through its followers.

Even more intolerable is that the Soviet revisionists not only protect the U.S. imperialist tool of aggression, Israel, but also vigorously advocate the so-called "Tashkent spirit," urging the Palestinian people to "coexist peacefully" with Israel, attempting to maintain Israel as a tool of U.S. imperialist aggression.

At international conferences manipulated by the Soviet revisionists, such as the "Eighth Conference of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council" held illegally in Nicosia at the beginning of this year and the pseudo "Third Afro-Asian Writers' Conference" held in Beirut, the Soviet revisionist delegation not only did not condemn the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and Israel but also vigorously obstructed the passage of resolutions supporting the struggle of the Palestinian people.

The ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism on the Palestinian issue has long been exposed by the Palestinian and Arab peoples. Recently in Cairo, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Shukairi said: Some countries claim to be socialist countries, but at the same time, they support, recognize, and collude with Israel. They are not true socialist countries. In March of this year, at the 47th session of the Arab League Council, Secretary-General Hassouna publicly condemned Kosygin's statement in December last year during his visit to Paris regarding the lifting of restrictions on the migration of Soviet Jews to Israel.

Through their struggles over the past decade, the Palestinian people have increasingly recognized the true face of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique in betraying the interests of revolutionary people and are firmly advancing in the correct direction. They clearly recognize that only armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine and are determined to take up arms to return to their homeland. Now, the Palestinian people already have a relatively strong liberation army, and they are also establishing their own militia organizations. In the Gaza Strip and within Syrian territory, Palestinian refugees are taking up arms and participating in military training. They are determined to achieve the goal of returning to their homeland through people's war. The just struggle of the Palestinian people has received the sympathy and support of the Arab people and revolutionary people around the world.

The Palestinian people have found the truth of Mao Zedong Thought through their long-term struggle and recognized that the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is their guiding light to liberation.

Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on armed struggle, people's war, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, self-reliance, etc., have become powerful ideological weapons guiding and inspiring the Palestinian people's struggle. The Palestinian revolutionary people regard Chairman Mao as their great teacher and savior and regard the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought as their most reliable comrades-in-arms and strongest backing.

As Shukairi, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said well: "We are not afraid of anyone slandering our friendship with China and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. On the contrary, we are proud of our friendship with China and Mao Zedong." The Palestinian people have awakened, and their struggle against U.S. imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, is deepening. Whether it is U.S. imperialism or its number one accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism, they cannot stop the fighting Palestinian people from advancing bravely on the revolutionary path.

### 苏修是出卖巴勒斯坦人民的罪魁祸首  同美帝侵略工具以色列勾勾搭搭大做交易，并向以色列大量移民  鼓吹“塔什干精神”，竟要巴勒斯坦人民同以色列“和平共处”

    苏修是出卖巴勒斯坦人民的罪魁祸首
    同美帝侵略工具以色列勾勾搭搭大做交易，并向以色列大量移民
    鼓吹“塔什干精神”，竟要巴勒斯坦人民同以色列“和平共处”
    新华社开罗十四日电　本社记者报道：苏联修正主义领导集团对于巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，加紧玩弄假支持、真出卖的阴险手法，同时，它配合世界人民公敌美帝国主义，千方百计地庇护美帝国主义在中东的侵略工具以色列。苏修在巴勒斯坦问题上的叛卖行为，正遭到日益觉醒的巴勒斯坦人民的强烈反对。
    十九年前的五月十四日，美帝国主义一手制造出了一个以色列，它是插在阿拉伯人民背上的一把尖刀。第二天，即五月十五日，以色列就向周围的阿拉伯国家发动了一场大规模的侵略战争，侵占土地六千多平方公里，把一百多万巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人赶出自己的家园。从那一天起，美国侵略者就进一步把它自己放在同全体阿拉伯人民公开为敌的地位，在它的脖子上套上了一条新的绞索。
    十九年来，巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民一直在坚持反对美帝及其侵略工具以色列、要求重返家园的正义斗争，而且越战越强。一九六四年以来，相继成立了巴勒斯坦解放组织和解放军。但是，作为美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏修领导集团，却一直不支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争，而庇护以色列。随着巴勒斯坦人民斗争的蓬勃发展，苏修就加紧玩弄假支持、真出卖的手法。
    到现在，苏修领导集团还继续承认以色列这个美国侵略工具，并且“改善”和它的关系。沾满巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民鲜血的以色列国旗可以在莫斯科的上空飘扬，以色列的“大使”公然成为克里姆林宫的上宾。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯曾在去年四月同以色列外长阿巴·伊班就进一步发展关系的问题举行了会谈。据阿巴·伊班透露，以色列对于苏以双方的“接近”表示很满意。他还得意洋洋地宣布：“去年我们同部分东欧国家的外交、商业和文化关系有所加强。”
    不仅如此，苏修领导集团还一直把大批苏联的犹太人移居到以色列去。据统计，在最近十年里，从其他地区迁居到以色列的四十多万犹太人中，主要是来自苏联和某些东欧国家。一位巴勒斯坦朋友一针见血地指出：“在以色列，美国出枪，苏联出人，美、苏、以色列合伙同巴勒斯坦人民为敌。”
    据英国《经济学家》周刊最近透露，苏联和以色列的贸易近年来有了很大增长。一九六六年头十一个月，苏联从以色列进口的商品总额达一百九十万美元，相当于一九六五年同期的四倍。此外，苏联还通过它的追随者，同以色列进行了大量经济往来。
    更加令人不可容忍的是，苏修不仅自己庇护美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列，而且还竭力鼓吹所谓“塔什干精神”，要巴勒斯坦人民和以色列“和平共处”，企图维持以色列作为美帝国主义的侵略工具的现状。
    在苏修操纵的国际会议上，例如今年初在尼科西亚非法召开的“第八届亚非团结理事会会议”和在贝鲁特召开的伪“第三届亚非作家大会”，苏修代表团不仅不谴责美帝国主义和以色列的侵略罪行，而且竭力阻挠通过支持巴勒斯坦人民的斗争的决议。
    苏修领导集团在巴勒斯坦问题上暴露出来的美帝头号帮凶的丑恶面目，早已被巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯人民所识破。巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里最近在开罗说：一些国家自称为社会主义国家，但同时却支持、承认和勾结以色列，它们不是真正的社会主义国家。阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳今年三月在阿拉伯联盟理事会第四十七次会议上的报告中，也公开谴责苏修头目柯西金去年十二月在访问巴黎时发表的关于取消对苏联的犹太人向以色列迁移的限制的声明。
    巴勒斯坦人民通过他们十几年来的斗争，越来越清楚地认识到苏修统治集团出卖革命人民利益的真面目，坚定地朝着正确的方向前进。他们明确地认识到，只有武装斗争才是解放巴勒斯坦的唯一道路，决心拿起枪杆子打回老家去。现在，巴勒斯坦人民已经有了一支比较强大的解放军，同时，他们还正在建立自己的民兵组织。在加沙地区和叙利亚境内的巴勒斯坦难民纷纷拿起武器，参加军事训练。他们决心用人民战争来达到返回家园的目的。巴勒斯坦人民的正义斗争，受到了阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民的同情和支持。
    巴勒斯坦人民从自己的长期斗争实践中找到了毛泽东思想的真理，认识到光辉的毛泽东思想才是他们求解放的指路明灯。
    毛主席关于武装斗争、人民战争、帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎、自力更生等光辉论述，已经成为指导和鼓舞巴勒斯坦人民进行斗争的强大思想武器。巴勒斯坦革命人民把毛主席看作是自己的伟大导师和救星，把用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，看作是他们最可信赖的战友和最坚强的后盾。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里说得好：“我们不怕有人诽谤我们同中国和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的友谊，相反，我们为自己同中国和毛泽东的友谊而感到自豪。”巴勒斯坦人民已经觉醒，他们反对美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争正在深入发展。不管是美帝国主义，还是它的头号帮凶苏联现代修正主义，都无法阻止战斗的巴勒斯坦人民在革命的大道上奋勇前进。
