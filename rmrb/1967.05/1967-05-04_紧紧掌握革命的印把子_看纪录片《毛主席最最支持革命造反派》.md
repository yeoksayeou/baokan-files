The film "Mao Chairman Most Strongly Supports the Revolutionary Rebels" vividly records the great storm of the "January Revolution." As soldiers of the proletarian revolutionary faction in Shanghai, we found the film particularly touching and inspiring.

Comrade Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The same is true for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, the handful of power-holders within the old Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and Municipal People's Committee who are taking the capitalist road, relying on the support of the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, have played all sorts of tricks, attempting to sabotage the Cultural Revolution. Initially, they used the pretext of "focusing on production" to suppress the revolution. When we proletarian revolutionaries exposed their tricks and resolutely rose up in revolution, they then spread the evil wind of economism, using their remaining power to stir up trouble, inciting a large number of workers deceived by them to leave their production posts, disrupt production, and sabotage the state's finances and economy. This handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road attempted to use these vicious methods to strangle us, cut off our lifelines, and undermine the foundations of socialism.

However, just like all reactionaries in the world, they are fools who lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet. They have sounded their own death knell and created the conditions for their own complete downfall. The glorious revolutionary tradition of the Shanghai proletariat and the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries, tempered by revolutionary storms, were indignant at the crimes of this handful of revisionists. Under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionaries—workers, students, cadres, and revolutionary teachers and students who came to Shanghai for revolutionary activities—achieved great unity. United, we bravely shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, checked the counterrevolutionary economism, repelled the new onslaught of the bourgeois reactionary line, and quickly turned the situation around. In this life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, we proletarian revolutionaries launched a "January Revolution" that shook the world, resolutely seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We firmly grasped in our own hands the destiny of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the destiny of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the destiny of the socialist economy.

At this crucial moment, our dearest and closest leader, Chairman Mao, gave us the strongest support for our revolutionary rebel actions. He personally approved the issuance of the "Declaration to the People of Shanghai" and the "Urgent Notice." The Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group also sent congratulatory telegrams to the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries.

Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee have repeatedly given us strong support, each time making us so excited that we shed tears. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, it is you who most strongly support our revolutionary actions, it is you who give us the greatest strength. We will never forget that in the days when the bourgeois reactionary line was savagely suppressing us, some worker comrades, even when sick with high fever, still held your quotations, drawing spiritual strength from your teachings. We will follow your teachings, never forget class struggle, and firmly grasp the helm of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, after watching "Mao Chairman Most Strongly Supports the Revolutionary Rebels," we once again pledge to you: We will forever listen to your words, dedicate our lives to the revolution, and never rest on the laurels of the achievements since the "January Revolution." We will forever be loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line, hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the top power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    电影《毛主席最最支持革命造反派》以动人的场景，纪录了伟大的“一月革命”风暴。作为上海市无产阶级革命派的战士，看了这部电影，我们感到格外的亲切，受到了极大的鼓舞。
    毛主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派说来，也是这样。无产阶级文化大革命开展以来，上海旧市委和市人委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，仗着有党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的背后支持，玩弄种种阴谋诡计，妄图破坏文化大革命。起初，他们以“抓生产”为名来压制革命，当我们无产阶级革命派戳穿了他们的阴谋，坚决起来革命时，他们又大刮经济主义的阴风，凭着他们手里还掌着权，兴风作浪，煽动大批被他们蒙蔽的工人擅自离开生产岗位，破坏生产，破坏国家财政金融。这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图用这种毒辣的手段，卡住我们的咽喉，切断我们的血管，挖社会主义的墙脚。
    但是，正象世界上一切反动派一样，他们都是搬起石头打自己的脚的蠢人，他们自己给自己敲响了丧钟，自己为自己创造了彻底垮台的条件。具有光荣革命传统的上海工人阶级和历经革命风暴考验的上海市无产阶级革命派，目睹这一小撮修正主义分子倒行逆施的罪恶，无不义愤填膺。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，无产阶级革命派的工人、学生、干部，以及来沪串连的革命师生，实行了大联合。大家团结在一起，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，煞住了反革命经济主义黑风，击退了资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，迅速扭转了局面。就在这两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线你死我活的斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派掀起了一场震撼全世界的“一月革命”风暴，坚决把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里的权夺过来，把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧掌握在自己的手里。
    就在这关键时刻，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，对我们的革命造反行动给予了最大的支持。他老人家亲自批准发表了《告上海全市人民书》和《紧急通告》。中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组还给上海市无产阶级革命派发来了贺电。
    毛主席和党中央一次又一次地大力支持我们，每次都使我们激动得流下了眼泪。毛主席啊，毛主席，是您老人家最最支持我们的革命行动，是您老人家给了我们最大的力量。我们永远不会忘记，在资产阶级反动路线对我们进行疯狂镇压的日子里，有的工人同志生病发着高烧，还手捧着您的语录，从您的教导中汲取精神力量。我们要遵照您的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，牢牢掌握无产阶级专政的印把子。
    毛主席啊，毛主席，我们看了《毛主席最最支持革命造反派》后，再一次向您宣誓：我们要永远听您的话，干一辈子革命，决不躺在“一月革命”以来取得的成绩上。我们要永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线，高举革命批判大旗，彻底批判以党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
