Revolutionary comrades, fellow fighters!

First of all, let us pay our highest respects to the red sun in our hearts, our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao! May Chairman Mao live ten thousand years! Ten thousand years! May Comrade Lin Biao enjoy good health forever! Forever!

Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has been published for twenty-five years. Over these twenty-five years, this brilliant work has been like a lighthouse, illuminating our path in revolutionary literary and artistic work. Since we participated in the Peking Opera revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, we have all had a common experience: the Peking Opera revolution is the focal point of the intense struggle between the two classes and the two lines on the cultural front. The more actively revolutionary literary and artistic workers engage in this struggle, the more acute the struggle becomes, the more we feel the closeness of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and the more deeply we understand the great significance of this brilliant work. Chairman Mao said:

"Our literature and art are for the people, first of all for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to create for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to be used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must make literature and art a powerful weapon for uniting and educating the people, for striking and annihilating the enemy, and for helping the people fight the enemy with one heart and one mind."

"Red Lantern," "Sha Jiahui," "The Red Detachment of Women," "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," and "The Port" and other revolutionary modern Peking operas are all created and grown in the great waves of class struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought, breaking through the stronghold of old Peking Opera. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, an important achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and a special contribution of Comrade Jiang Qing to the Peking Opera revolution.

The achievement of this great victory was indeed hard-won. In our journey forward, there were stormy waves and dangerous reefs, and the greatest obstacle was the capitalist-roader in power within the Party and his backer, the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line. These scoundrels used all kinds of despicable and shameless tricks, soft, hard, covert, and overt, to try to undermine and destroy our revolutionary ranks, and to strangle and destroy our revolutionary modern Peking operas. They regarded the feudal old plays that poisoned the working people and undermined the socialist economic base as treasures, saying they were "very educational," but they regarded the revolutionary modern plays that propagated Mao Zedong Thought and praised the working people as monsters, saying they were "a waste of people's labor and energy" and "a waste of actors' youth," and even threatened to "ruin" these revolutionary model operas that the workers, peasants, and soldiers liked and to "criticize each line of the singing." They hated the revolutionary modern Peking operas to the core and were sworn enemies. Their purpose was to try to make emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties rule the Peking Opera stage forever and to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

These scoundrels, in addition to using slander, rumors, and defamation to attack us from the outside, were even more sinister and vicious in adopting the tactic of Sun Wukong entering the belly of the Iron Fan Princess, infiltrating the drama troupe, attempting to replace the revolutionary modern plays with counter-revolutionary ones. In choosing and determining the major themes and related subjects that propagate Mao Zedong Thought, in shaping the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers, in pushing forward and establishing the new socialist standards and the distinctiveness of the proletariat, and in other key and major principle issues, the struggle was the most intense and fierce. For example, in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," there was such an intense struggle: should the main theme be the great strategic thought of people's war advocated by Chairman Mao, or should it be the reactionary military line of detachment from the people and blind adventurism? Should the protagonist be a proletarian revolutionary warrior armed with Mao Zedong Thought, brave and wise, standing tall and firm, or should it be a protagonist full of banditry and black slang? In "The Port," there was also such an intense struggle: should the main theme be the internationalism and patriotism of the Chinese working class, or should it be the cultivation of a successor in the style of Khrushchev? Should the protagonist be a heroic figure of the working class who stands on the dock, has a heart for the country, and eyes for the world, or should it be a protagonist with a complex mind and split personality? This is a concrete reflection of the struggle between the two classes and the two lines in the Peking Opera revolution. The former is the advocacy of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and the latter is the conspiracy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line backed by the capitalist-roader in power within the Party. This is a life-and-death struggle between the two lines. In this struggle, Comrade Jiang Qing, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and regarding "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as the highest directive, led us bravely into the battle, unyielding and unshakable, opposing the latter and insisting on the former. Finally, the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line's conspiracy of attacking from both inside and outside was declared bankrupt, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line achieved one victory after another.

Here, we must also mention that: to realize Chairman Mao's teaching of "unifying revolutionary political content with the most perfect artistic form," in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Port," Comrade Jiang Qing participated in both the struggle practice and the artistic practice, grasping both principles and specifics, both the main theme and artistic details. Every word and every tune were permeated with Comrade Jiang Qing's blood and sweat. Her resolute spirit of thoroughly carrying out Mao Zedong Thought and her high sense of revolutionary responsibility deeply moved us and inspired us to forge ahead; thus, we deepened our feelings for Mao Zedong Thought and for Chairman Mao.

Through this great struggle of destruction and construction, of life and death, we deeply understand: class struggle is long-term, tortuous, and complex. Chairman Mao said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not resign themselves to their defeat; they will make their last struggle." Therefore, we must always put politics in command, never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be revolutionary fighters for life, and do the Peking Opera revolution for life. We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching in "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art": "Go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers for a long time, unconditionally, and wholeheartedly, and go to the fiery struggle," combine with the workers and peasants, thoroughly reform ourselves, and achieve the revolutionization of thought. At present, we must especially follow Chairman Mao's highest directive, achieve revolutionary great unity, and thoroughly complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Overthrow the capitalist-roader in power within the Party and his supported counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, ghosts, and monsters, root them out completely, and make sure they never rise again! These scoundrels once attacked "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" and "The Port" as "Shan Hai Jing," and maliciously ridiculed us, saying: "When will your 'Shan Hai Jing' end?" Now we answer you: our revolutionary "Shan Hai Jing" will go on forever, will never end, will always strive for perfection, and will always let the heroic figures of Li Yuhe, Guo Jian'guang, Yang Weicai, Yang Zhenrong, Fang Haizhen, and others stand tall and shine brightly on the socialist stage, serving the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!

    京剧革命是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利
    于会咏同志在首都纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年大会上的讲话革命的同志们，战友们！
    首先让我们敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！敬祝我们林副主席身体永远健康！永远健康！
    毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年了。二十五年以来，这篇光辉著作，象光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了我们革命文艺工作前进的航程。自从我们参加了江青同志亲自领导的京剧革命，我们都有这样一个共同的体会：京剧革命是文艺战线上两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争的焦点；革命的文艺战士，越是积极地投入这一斗争，越是在斗争尖锐的时刻，就越是感到毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的无比亲切，就越能更深刻地懂得这篇光辉著作的伟大意义。毛主席说：
  “我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”。《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》、《智取威虎山》和《海港》等革命现代京剧，就是在毛泽东文艺思想的指引下，攻破旧京剧这个顽固的堡垒，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中诞生和成长的。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的重要成果，是江青同志对京剧革命的特殊贡献。
    这一伟大成就的取得，确实来之不易。在我们前进的航道上，有惊涛骇浪，有险滩暗礁，而最大的阻力就是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。这些家伙，施尽了各种卑劣无耻的伎俩，软一套，硬一套，阴一套，阳一套，挖空心思地瓦解和破坏我们的革命队伍，费尽心机地扼杀和摧残我们的革命现代京剧。他们把毒害劳动人民、破坏社会主义经济基础的封建旧戏，奉为至宝，说是“很有教育意义”，却把宣传毛泽东思想、歌颂劳动人民的革命现代戏，视为洪水猛兽，说是“劳民伤财”、“糟蹋演员青春”，并扬言要把这些为工农兵喜闻乐见的革命样板戏“搞臭”，“要把唱腔一句一句批倒”。他们对革命现代京剧恨之入骨、誓不两立。其目的就是妄图让帝王将相、才子佳人永远统治京剧舞台，为复辟资本主义鸣锣开道。
    这些家伙，除了用流言蜚语、造谣中伤、诋毁诽谤等卑鄙手段从外部进行攻击之外，更阴险恶毒的是采用孙悟空钻进铁扇公主肚子里的战术，打入剧组内部，企图偷梁换柱，把革命现代戏引入邪路。在选择和确定宣传毛泽东思想的重大主题及有关的题材上，在塑造工农兵英雄形象上，在推陈出新、标社会主义之新、立无产阶级之异等等关键性的重大原则问题上，斗争最为尖锐，最为激烈。例如，在《智取威虎山》中，就有这样尖锐的斗争：是以宣传毛主席人民战争的伟大战略思想为主题思想呢？还是以宣传脱离人民、盲动冒险的反动军事路线为主题思想呢？是塑造一个以毛泽东思想武装起来的有勇有谋、顶天立地的无产阶级革命战士为主人公呢，还是塑造一个浑身匪气、满嘴黑话的绿林好汉为主人公呢？在《海港》中，也有这样尖锐的斗争：是以歌颂中国工人阶级的国际主义和爱国主义的豪情壮志为主题思想呢，还是以培养中国赫鲁晓夫式的接班人为主题思想呢？是塑造立足码头、胸怀祖国、放眼世界的工人阶级的英雄人物为主人公呢，还是塑造心理复杂、精神分裂的“中间人物”为主人公呢？这就是两个阶级、两条路线在京剧革命斗争中的具体反映。前者，就是毛主席革命文艺路线的主张，后者，则是以党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线的阴谋。这是一场你死我活的两条路线的斗争。在这场斗争中，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》为最高指示，带领我们勇敢地投入战斗，坚韧不拔、百折不回，反对了后者，坚持了前者，终于使反革命修正主义文艺黑线里外夹攻的阴谋宣告破产，使毛主席的革命文艺路线取得了一个又一个的重大胜利。
    在这里，我们还必须提到的是：江青同志为了实现毛主席的“革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一”的教导，在《智取威虎山》、《海港》中，她既参加了斗争实践，又参加了艺术实践，既抓原则，又抓具体，既抓主题思想，又抓艺术细节。一字一句，一腔一板，都渗透着江青同志的心血。她的这种坚决贯彻毛泽东思想的彻底革命精神和高度的革命责任感，深深地感动着我们，激励我们奋勇前进；从而使我们对毛泽东思想，对毛主席他老人家，感情更加深厚了。
    通过这场大破大立，你死我活的阶级斗争，我们深深懂得：阶级斗争是长期的、曲折的、复杂的。毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”因此，我们今后一定做到永远突出政治，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做一辈子革命战士，干一辈子京剧革命。一定遵照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中的教导：“长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去”，和工农相结合，彻底改造自己，实现思想革命化。在当前，尤其要遵照毛主席的最高指示，实现革命大联合，彻底完成斗、批、改的任务，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他支持的反革命修正主义文艺黑线以及地、富、反、坏，牛鬼蛇神，统统打倒，彻底挖掉老根，叫它永无翻身之日！这些家伙，不是曾经攻击《智取威虎山》和《海港》是什么“山海经”，而又恶毒地讽刺我们说：“你们的山海经要谈到什么时候才了结”吗？现在回答你们：我们革命的“山海经”是要永远“谈”下去的，永远不会了结的，永远精益求精的，永远让李玉和、郭建光、杨伟才、杨子荣、方海珍……这样光辉而高大的英雄形象，屹立在社会主义舞台上，大放异彩，光芒四射，为全中国人民，为全世界人民服务！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    毛主席革命文艺路线万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！！
