The Indonesian Communist Party Central Committee delegation today issued a statement titled "Hail the Publication of the Indonesian Version of the Red Book 'Quotations from Chairman Mao'." The full text of the statement is as follows:

On May 1, 1967, the day of victory for the working class around the world, the Indonesian version of the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was published.

We, the delegation of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, together with all the people of Indonesia, not only feel immense joy but also express our heartfelt thanks to the Communist Party of China and the people of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The publication of the Indonesian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is an invaluable act of internationalism, and it will become a powerful weapon in the hands of the Indonesian people, whose current main task is to overthrow the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution.

This Indonesian version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," like other versions that have already spread around the world, is a direct blow to the imperialists led by American imperialism, the modern revisionists centered around the leadership of the CPSU, and the reactionaries of all countries. They fear Mao Zedong Thought, which is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. On the contrary, revolutionary people around the world love and seriously study Mao Zedong Thought. "Quotations from Chairman Mao" provides scientific and profound answers to many questions that arise daily in the current revolutionary movement. It ignites a new wave of struggle for seizing power among revolutionaries everywhere.

We Indonesian Communists and revolutionaries firmly believe that with Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, we will be able to overcome all difficulties and ultimately achieve victory in the arduous and protracted struggle. We believe that Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings are completely correct. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Both reactionary forces and we have difficulties. However, the difficulties of reactionary forces are insurmountable because they are forces that are approaching death and have no future. Our difficulties are surmountable because we are new and have a bright future."

The publication and widespread dissemination of the Indonesian version and other versions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is another major victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, with a single cannon shot, has sent the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought—the only theory that wins contemporary revolutionary victories—more broadly and deeply to the revolutionary people of the world.

We, the delegation of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party, firmly believe that the red book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in the hands of Indonesian Communists and revolutionaries will become a powerful weapon in the struggle to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime and establish people's democratic dictatorship in Indonesia.

    印尼共产党中央代表团欢呼《毛主席语录》印尼文版出版
    《毛主席语录》是印尼人民革命的强大武器
    新华社二十五日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团今天发表题为《欢呼红书〈毛主席语录〉印度尼西亚文版的出版》的声明。声明的全文如下：
    正值一九六七年五月一日，全世界工人阶级胜利的节日，《毛主席语录》这本红书的印度尼西亚文版出版了。
    我们，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团同全体印度尼西亚人民一道不仅感到无比喜悦，而且向毛泽东同志领导下的中国共产党和中国人民表示衷心的感谢。
    印度尼西亚文版《毛主席语录》的出版是不可估量的国际主义的援助，并将成为其当前主要任务是推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权的印度尼西亚人民手中的强大的武器。
    这本印度尼西亚文版《毛主席语录》，同早些时候已传播到全世界的其它文版《毛主席语录》一样，是对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义者，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者和各国反动派的直接打击。他们害怕毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想是当代即帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的最高水平的马克思列宁主义。相反的，全世界革命人民都热爱和认真地学习毛泽东思想。《毛主席语录》对目前革命运动中每天所发生的许多问题都作了科学的和精辟的解答。它到处激起了革命者为夺取政权而斗争的新热潮。
    我们印度尼西亚共产党人和革命者坚信，以毛泽东思想为武器，我们一定能够克服一切困难，并终将在艰巨和长期的斗争中取得胜利。我们认为毛泽东同志的教导是完全正确的，毛泽东同志说：“反动势力面前和我们面前都有困难。但是反动势力的困难是不可能克服的，因为他们是接近于死亡的没有前途的势力。我们的困难是能够克服的，因为我们是新兴的有光明前途的势力。”
    印度尼西亚文版和其他各种文版的《毛主席语录》的出版和广泛传播，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的又一个重大胜利。中国无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，把伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想——赢得当代革命胜利的唯一理论，更广泛和更深入地送给了全世界革命人民。
    我们，印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会代表团坚信，在印度尼西亚共产党人和革命者手中的《毛主席语录》这本红书，必将成为在印度尼西亚推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军事政权和建立人民民主专政而进行斗争的强大武器。
