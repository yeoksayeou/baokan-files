Only by liberating all of humanity can the proletariat finally liberate itself. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our greatest teacher, Chairman Mao, has repeatedly used Marx's brilliant idea to guide us. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao is the most brilliant embodiment of this idea.

Anarchism, on the other hand, believes that only by liberating oneself can one liberate all of humanity. Regarding this issue, Comrade Stalin has made an excellent exposition:

"The question is that Marxism and anarchism are based on completely different principles, although both sides, when they take to the stage of struggle, raise the banner of socialism. Anarchism is based on the individual, believing that the liberation of the individual is the main condition for the liberation of the masses and the collective. In the eyes of anarchism, the liberation of the masses is impossible before the individual is liberated, so its slogan is 'everything for the individual.' Marxism, on the other hand, is based on the masses, believing that the liberation of the masses is the main condition for the liberation of the individual. That is to say, in the eyes of Marxism, the liberation of the individual is impossible before the masses are liberated, so its slogan is 'everything for the masses.'"

Mao Zedong Thought and anarchism are fundamentally opposed.

From the perspective of Mao Zedong Thought, communists have no unique interests of their own, but regard the class interests of the proletariat as their own interests, and the collective interests of the laboring people of the whole world as their highest interests. For these interests, they will climb mountains of blades and tread on fires, shatter their bodies, and die without regret. Anarchism, however, completely ignores the common interests of the proletariat, emphasizes the interests of individuals and small groups, and for these interests, they will exhaust their hearts and minds, use tricks, and suffer head injuries and bloodshed without hesitation.

From the perspective of Mao Zedong Thought, it is believed that the authority of the proletariat must be established, respected, and maintained. Because this authority is completely based on safeguarding the highest interests of the proletariat and the laboring people, it is to ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Anarchism, however, completely despises this authority, arbitrarily destroys this authority, establishes and exercises "my" authority, which is the authority of the bourgeoisie.

From the perspective of Mao Zedong Thought, it is believed that the close unity and solid unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces are necessary conditions for the proletariat to seize power and consolidate power. Therefore, one must see the big picture, consider the overall situation, and on the basis of the fundamental unity of the interests of the proletariat, unify wills and actions. Anarchism, however, denies the significance of unity and alliance, denies the necessity of unifying wills and actions, and at any time, strives to find reasons for "independent action."

From the perspective of Mao Zedong Thought, it is believed that as long as there are still classes and class struggles, there will always be a distinction between "a minority" and "a vast majority," and their interests are fundamentally conflicting: one wants to restore capitalism and preserve private ownership; the other wants to carry out a socialist revolution and develop public ownership. The two are irreconcilable. All revolutionary struggles of the proletariat, including the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have always firmly directed their spearheads at "a minority." Anarchism, however, "doubts everything, rejects everything, and overturns everything," disrupting our ranks.

From the perspective of Mao Zedong Thought, it is believed that "the people, and only the people, are the motive force of world history." Revolution is the people's business, which must be done by the people. It is necessary to firmly believe in the people, rely on the people, mobilize the people extensively, respect the pioneering spirit of the people, believe that the majority of the people are revolutionary or want to be revolutionary, and let the people educate themselves and liberate themselves. At the same time, do everything possible to turn backward people into advanced ones, and advanced ones into more advanced ones. Anarchism, starting from its historical idealism and extreme individualism, necessarily does not believe in the people, fears the people, treats the people as "Ah Dou," treats itself as Zhuge Liang, regards the people as "the common people," and regards itself as the "savior" and the hero who can fight the world.

Currently, we are launching a mass criticism movement against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and closely linking this movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit. This is a highly honorable and arduous task that must be fought with all our might. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to liberate a vast majority; it is also not enough to unite the majority of the people. Only by thoroughly liberating a vast majority can we thoroughly isolate and strike down a minority. Only by uniting the majority of the people and cadres can we "organize tens of millions of people and mobilize a surging revolutionary army," forming the strongest fist and striking "a minority" with the most accurate and powerful blows. "Liberating a vast majority" and uniting the majority of the people themselves are a fatal blow to the top capitalist-roader in the Party, and a death sentence to the bourgeois reactionary line. Anarchism, however, completely ignores these issues, does not dare and is not willing to unite the majority of the people, does not adopt a serious, active, and enthusiastic attitude to educate and unite comrades who have been deceived, but excludes them, and even excludes proletarian revolutionary comrades who have different opinions on specific issues, implementing a policy of lone wolves. This greatly weakens the struggle against the top capitalist-roader in the Party, which is not beneficial to us but beneficial to the enemy.

Anarchism, although it vigorously advocates the struggle between the two lines, does not understand the line struggle very well and often shows various opportunistic tendencies. Anarchism is a complex mixture of various opportunisms. It is completely opposed to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on two fundamental issues: on class relations, it is ambiguous, but in fact, it always clearly stands on the side of the bourgeoisie, creating trouble for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and is very unfavorable to the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship; on the issue of the masses, it does not believe in the masses, always puts the individual and small groups above the masses, and excludes the majority of the masses. From this, we have found the profound source of anarchism and the bourgeois reactionary line.

The proletarian revolutionary forces must adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and must resolutely oppose anarchism. If, in criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, anarchism is not overturned at the same time, the bourgeois reactionary line will still have a place to stay; if anarchism is overturned at the same time, the bourgeois reactionary line can be finally defeated.

Thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line!

Resolutely strike down anarchism!

    反对无政府主义　团结大多数　打击一小撮
    北京地质学院东方红公社　孟繁华
    只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们最伟大的导师毛主席曾经多次用马克思的这一光辉思想来教导我们。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线正是这个思想的最光辉的体现。
    无政府主义与之相反，认为只有解放自己，才能解放全人类。关于这个问题，斯大林同志有一段极好的论述：
    “问题在于马克思主义和无政府主义建立在完全不同的原则上，虽然双方登上斗争舞台时都举着社会主义的旗帜。无政府主义以个人为基础，认为解放个人是解放群众、解放集体的主要条件。在无政府主义看来，个人没有解放以前，群众的解放是不可能的，因此他的口号是‘一切为了个人’。而马克思主义则以群众为基础，认为解放群众是解放个人的主要条件。这就是说，在马克思主义看来，群众没有解放以前，个人的解放是不可能的，因此它的口号是‘一切为了群众’。”
    毛泽东思想和无政府主义是根本对立的。
    从毛泽东思想出发，认为共产党人没有自己独特的利益，而是把无产阶级的阶级利益作为自己的利益，把全世界劳动人民的集体利益作为自己的最高利益；为了这个利益，上刀山，下火海，粉身碎骨，死而无怨。无政府主义却完全无视无产阶级的共同利益，突出个人和小集团的利益，为了这个利益，他们呕心血，弄权术，碰得头破血流也在所不辞。
    从毛泽东思想出发，认为必须树立无产阶级权威，尊重这个权威，维护这个权威。因为这个权威完全是从维护无产阶级和劳动人民的最高利益出发的，是为了保证无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行的。无政府主义却完全蔑视这个权威，随意破坏这个权威，树立和施行“我”的权威，也就是资产阶级的权威。
    从毛泽东思想出发，认为无产阶级革命派的紧密联合和坚固团结，是无产阶级取得政权和巩固政权的必要条件，因此要识大体，顾大局，在无产阶级根本利益一致的基础上，统一意志、统一行动。无政府主义却否定团结和联合的意义，否定统一意志、统一行动的必要性，在任何时候，都极力为自己寻找“独立行动”的理由。
    从毛泽东思想出发，认为只要还有阶级和阶级斗争存在，总有“一小撮”和“一大片”之分，他们之间的利益是根本冲突的：一个要搞资本主义复辟，保存私有制；一个要搞社会主义革命，发展公有制。两者不可调和。无产阶级所进行的一切革命斗争，包括无产阶级文化大革命，都始终坚定不移地把矛头对准“一小撮”；无政府主义却“怀疑一切，排斥一切，打倒一切”，扰乱了我们的阵线。
    从毛泽东思想出发，认为“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”革命是群众的事，必须由群众来作，坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，相信大多数群众是革命的或要革命的，放手让群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己；同时，尽其所能促使落后的群众转变为先进，先进的向更先进转化。无政府主义从它的历史唯心主义和极端个人主义出发，必然不相信群众，害怕群众，把群众当“阿斗”，把自己当诸葛亮，把群众看成“芸芸众生”，把自己当成“救世主”和包打天下的好汉。
    当前，我们正在掀起一个对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的群众性的大批判运动，并把这个运动和本单位的斗、批、改紧密地结合起来。这是一项极其光荣而艰巨的任务，必须全力以赴打好这一仗。为了实现这个目标，不解放一大片是不行的，不团结群众的大多数也是不行的。只有彻底解放一大片，才能彻底孤立打击一小撮。只有团结群众和干部的大多数，才能“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，形成最结实的拳头，最准确、最有力地打击“一小撮”。“解放一大片”和团结大多数群众本身，就是对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的一个致命打击，就是对资产阶级反动路线处以死刑。无政府主义全然不顾这些，不敢也不愿去团结群众的大多数，不是以严肃、积极、热情的态度去教育和团结曾经受过蒙蔽的同志，而是排斥他们，甚至排斥在某些具体问题上与自己意见不同的无产阶级革命派战友，实行孤家寡人政策。这样，就大大削弱了对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，不利于我，有利于敌。
    无政府主义虽然极力标榜两条路线的斗争，但它对路线斗争是很不理解的，时常表现出各种机会主义的倾向。无政府主义是各种机会主义的复杂混合物，它在两个根本问题上是与毛主席的革命路线完全对立的：在阶级关系上，它含混不清，实际上总是非常明确地站到了资产阶级一边去，为无产阶级文化大革命制造麻烦，对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政非常不利；在群众问题上，它不相信群众，总是把个人和小团体放在群众之上，排斥群众的大多数。于此，我们就找到了无政府主义和资产阶级反动路线的深刻的渊源。
    无产阶级革命派要坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，彻底地批判资产阶级反动路线，就必须同时坚定地反对无政府主义。如果在批判资产阶级反动路线时不连同无政府主义一起反掉，资产阶级反动路线就还有栖身之所；如果连同无政府主义一起反掉，就可以最后将资产阶级反动路线一军了。
    彻底批判资产阶级反动路线！
    坚决打倒无政府主义！
