A progressive individual from Iraq recently praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, stating that it is "a reliable guarantee for the victory of socialism and the defeat of imperialism and revisionism." He sincerely praised Chairman Mao for inheriting and developing Marxism-Leninism, calling him the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time.

This progressive individual pointed out: The great people of China, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have thoroughly criticized and repudiated the old ideology, old customs, old habits, and old culture of the exploiting classes, and have established the new ideology, new customs, new habits, and new culture of the proletariat. This revolution has promoted the ideological revolutionization of the Chinese people and has prevented the restoration of capitalism in China. He said: "The experience of the Soviet Union shows that because the roots of the bourgeoisie have not been eliminated, the bourgeoisie has returned. Therefore, without eliminating the fundamental cause of capitalist restoration—the basis of the bourgeoisie—socialism cannot be victorious, and the emergence of revisionism cannot be prevented."

He pointed out: "Although the Communist Party of the Soviet Union still exists, revisionism has already appeared in the Soviet Union. The revisionists have taken control of the entire Soviet Union, seized power, and disregarded the victories and sacrifices of the Soviet people, continuing to slide down the capitalist road."

This progressive individual strongly denounced the vicious attacks by imperialism and revisionism on China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought. He said: "The radio, newspapers, and all propaganda tools of imperialism and revisionism are shouting and attacking the Cultural Revolution and Mao Zedong Thought. The imperialists and Soviet revisionists, along with their accomplices, are using all kinds of distortions and slanders to defame the Cultural Revolution. They shed crocodile tears for democracy and socialism. They curse, threaten, and are extremely crazy. They have lost their reason and are filled with hatred. This is a very, very good thing."

He said: Mao Zedong Thought is a sharp sword piercing the hearts of imperialism and modern revisionism. The sharper the sword, the more imperialism and modern revisionism will howl. He said: "Those hired newspapers that get their information from the broadcasts and newspapers of the Moscow revisionists and imperialists try their best to distort the true revolutionary face of the Cultural Revolution; they distort Mao Zedong Thought. But how can a sieve cover the sun? Their attempts are all in vain."

This progressive individual emphasized: "The attacks by imperialists and revisionists on Mao Zedong Thought, on the Cultural Revolution, and on the brave people of China are all to be expected. This confirms the greatness and immense power of Mao Zedong Thought and completely proves the correctness and mighty power of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in People's China. The targets of the attacks by imperialists and revisionists are precisely People's China and the proletariat of the whole world, as well as all oppressed nations who want to take the best road." He expressed his firm belief: "The revolution initiated and led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the wise helmsman, will certainly achieve victory and will certainly shatter all the attacks by imperialism and revisionism."

    伊拉克朋友欢呼中国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    文化大革命是打垮帝修的可靠保证
    帝修的反华嚎叫证明毛泽东思想的伟大和无比威力
    新华社讯　伊拉克一位进步人士最近热烈赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命“是社会主义胜利和打垮帝国主义与修正主义的可靠保证”。他由衷地称颂毛主席继承和发展了马克思列宁主义，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    这位进步人士指出：伟大的中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中大破剥削阶级的旧思想、旧风俗、旧习惯、旧文化，大立无产阶级的新思想、新风俗、新习惯、新文化。这场革命促使了中国人民的思想革命化，并在中国防止了资本主义复辟的可能性。他说：“苏联的经验证明，由于资产阶级的根源没有铲除，资产阶级已经卷土重来。因此，不铲除资本主义复辟的总根子——资产阶级的基础，社会主义就不能胜利，就不能防止出现修正主义。”
    他指出：“尽管苏联共产党仍然存在，然而在苏联已经出现了修正主义。修正主义分子统治了整个苏联，窃踞了政权，他们把列宁和斯大林的国家，把苏联人民所取得的胜利和作出的牺牲置于脑后，而在资本主义道路上继续滑下去。”
    这位进步人士痛斥帝国主义和修正主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命和毛泽东思想的恶毒攻击。他说：“帝国主义和修正主义的广播、报刊以及一切宣传工具，都声嘶力竭地广泛地攻击文化大革命和毛泽东思想。帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者以及他们的帮凶，竭尽种种歪曲诬蔑之能事，丑化文化大革命。他们为民主和社会主义流下了鳄鱼的眼泪。他们谩骂、威胁，疯狂已极。他们失去理智，恨得要死。这是非常非常好的事情。”
    他说：毛泽东思想是刺入帝国主义和现代修正主义心脏的利剑，宝剑越是锋利，帝国主义和现代修正主义就越是大声嚎叫。他说：“那些从莫斯科修正主义者和帝国主义者的广播和报刊中取得消息来源的雇佣报纸，妄图竭力歪曲文化大革命的真正革命面貌；歪曲毛泽东思想。但是筛子怎能遮住太阳，他们的种种企图，都是枉费心机的。”
    这位进步人士强调指出：“帝国主义者和修正主义者对毛泽东思想的攻击，对文化大革命和英勇的中国人民的攻击，都是意料中的事情。这向我们证实了毛泽东思想的伟大和无比的威力，完全证明了人民中国的无产阶级文化大革命的正确和强大威力。帝国主义者和修正主义者所攻击的目标，正是人民中国和全世界的无产阶级，以及一切被压迫民族所要走的一条最美好的道路。”他表示坚信：“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、英明的舵手所发动和领导的革命，终将取得胜利，终将粉碎帝国主义和修正主义的一切攻击。”
