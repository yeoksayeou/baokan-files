Capital revolutionary masses held a rally of 10,000 people today in Beijing Workers' Stadium to warmly welcome Chairman Mao's red diplomats, Yao Denshan and Xu Ren, who were expelled by the Indonesian reactionary government and returned to the side of the great leader Chairman Mao. They strongly condemned the Indonesian reactionary government's blatant violation of international norms, brutal infringement of the personal freedom of Chinese diplomatic personnel, and the heinous crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, Qiao Dafu, spoke first at the meeting, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's red diplomats for setting an example in their struggle against the enemy. He said, "Your brave struggle demonstrates the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought." Qiao Dafu said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The U.S. imperialists and all other scoundrels have already prepared their own gravediggers, and their days of being buried will not be long.' The new and old debts owed by the Indonesian reactionaries to the Chinese people must be thoroughly settled, and blood debts must be repaid with blood!"

Yao Denshan and Xu Ren both spoke at the meeting, expressing their deep gratitude to the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao for their warm concern.

Yao Denshan and Xu Ren strongly condemned the anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries in their speeches. They pointed out that the right-wing military clique led by Suharto-Nasution is completely a lackey and accomplice of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities are part of the international imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary alliance's anti-China activities, and are inseparable from its domestic policy of anti-communism and anti-people. They said, "In the sharp and intense class struggle, the Indonesian people are increasingly recognizing that only by arming themselves with the great Mao Zedong Thought and following the path of the Chinese revolution can they save Indonesia from national disaster and achieve their own liberation."

Yao Denshan and Xu Ren emphasized that the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the reliable guarantee and source of strength for the victory of our diplomatic personnel and patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia. Our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia and the broad patriotic overseas Chinese, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, fighting bravely against the Indonesian reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. In the struggle against the enemy, they have shown great revolutionary spirit, and the noble qualities and heroic spirit of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to the powerful socialist motherland. This fully proves that the Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

The speeches by Yao Denshan and Xu Ren were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience. Revolutionary masses repeatedly raised their fists and shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "The blood debts owed by the Indonesian reactionaries must be thoroughly settled!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Indonesia!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the victorious revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

Zhao Xiaoshou, a staff member of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia who bravely defended the five-starred flag in Jakarta and was injured by the Indonesian reactionaries, also attended the meeting and spoke.

Today's meeting was held by the Beijing Revolutionary Committee. Vice Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Wu De, and committee members Ding Guoyi, Wang Dabin, Li Dongmin, as well as responsible personnel from the PLA units stationed in Beijing, also attended the meeting.

    姚登山、徐仁说：用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不可战胜的
    新华社十九日讯　北京市各界革命群众一万人，今天在北京工人体育馆举行大会，热烈欢迎毛主席的红色外交战士、被印尼反动政府无理驱逐回国的我驻印尼大使馆临时代办姚登山和驻雅加达总领事徐仁胜利地回到了伟大领袖毛主席的身边；并且强烈谴责印尼反动政府肆无忌惮地破坏国际关系准则，粗暴侵犯中国外交人员的人身自由，疯狂进行反华排华的滔天罪行。
    北京市革命委员会常委蒯大富在会上首先讲话，热烈赞扬毛主席的红色外交战士在对敌斗争中，为我们树立了榜样。他说，你们的英勇斗争，表现了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比威力。蒯大富说，毛主席教导我们：“美帝国主义和其他一切害人虫已经准备好了自己的掘墓人，他们被埋葬的日子不会太长了。”印尼反动派欠下中国人民的笔笔新账旧账，一定要彻底清算，血债一定要用血来还！
    姚登山和徐仁在大会上先后讲了话，表示无限感激伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志对他们的亲切关怀。
    姚登山和徐仁在讲话中，强烈谴责印尼反动派反华排华的滔天罪行。他们指出，以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印尼右派军人集团，完全是美帝、苏修的走狗和帮凶，印尼反动政府反华排华，是国际上帝、修、反联合反华的一个组成部分，也是同它在国内推行反共、反人民政策分不开的。他们说，印尼人民在尖锐的激烈的阶级斗争中，越来越认识到：只有用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来，走中国革命的道路，才是唯一正确的道路，才能挽救印尼的民族灾难，求得自己的解放。
    姚登山和徐仁强调说，光焰无际的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我国外交人员和印尼爱国华侨胜利斗争的可靠保证和力量的源泉。我驻印尼的外交人员和广大爱国华侨，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，同印尼反动政府的反华排华活动进行了英勇的斗争，他们在对敌斗争中表现了大无畏的革命精神，和忠于毛主席，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于强大的社会主义祖国的高贵品质和英雄气概，充分说明了用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不可战胜的。
    姚登山、徐仁的讲话在全场激起一阵阵热烈的掌声。革命群众不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒印尼反动派！”“印尼反动派欠下的血债必须彻底清算！”“中国印尼两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    在雅加达英勇保护五星国旗，被印尼反动派枪击光荣负伤的我国驻印尼大使馆工作人员赵小寿，也参加了大会，并且讲了话。
    今天的大会是由北京市革命委员会举行的，北京市革命委员会副主任委员吴德，常委丁国钰、王大宾、李冬民等，以及中国人民解放军驻京各部队的负责人，也参加了今天的大会。
