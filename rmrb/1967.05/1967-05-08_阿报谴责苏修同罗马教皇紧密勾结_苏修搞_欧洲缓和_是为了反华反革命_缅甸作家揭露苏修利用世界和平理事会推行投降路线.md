According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana dated May 4th, the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published an article on May 4th, severely condemning the Soviet revisionists' close collusion with U.S. imperialism and Pope Paul VI, advocating so-called "European security" and "European unity."

The article states that the Soviet revisionist leadership and their followers enthusiastically welcomed the Pope's support on April 29th for "European unity" based on the rapprochement of Eastern and Western countries. This was also tacitly approved by the U.S. imperialists.

The article emphasizes that the Vatican, U.S. imperialism, and modern revisionism have established close cooperation. It is clear that the "European unity" advocated by the Pope and the "European security" advocated by the Soviet revisionist leadership are part of a joint plan by imperialism and revisionism. Their goal is to promote détente in Europe to shift the focus of international reactionary forces to Asia, Africa, and Latin America, primarily to counter the strongest bastion of socialism and the most reliable pillar of all revolutionary forces in the struggle against imperialism and reactionaries—the People's Republic of China.

The article states that the "holy trinity" of U.S. imperialism, revisionism, and the Pope cannot deceive the people of the European countries. The people of the European countries now understand that the U.S. imperialists' violent suppression of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and the sabotage by Khrushchev and Tito revisionists from within the revolutionary just struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are also directed against the people of the European countries.

The article states that under the leadership of the increasingly strengthened and consolidated Marxist-Leninist parties and groups, the workers, peasants, and advanced intellectuals of the European countries are becoming increasingly active in the revolutionary struggle against imperialism and revisionism. Now, they do not separate their struggle for economic conditions and social rights from the struggle against the imperialists and their lackeys' aggression in Vietnam and suppression of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Rangoon dated May 4th, the Burmese writer Du Amah published an article in the "People's News" on May 4th, exposing the Soviet revisionist leadership's use of the Lenin International Peace Prize to promote their revisionist surrender policy.

The article states that under the direct control of Khrushchev revisionism, the World Peace Council has degenerated into an institution that heavily propagates the terror of nuclear war and surrenderism.

The article states: Khrushchev revisionists do not allow people to resist U.S. imperialism but urge them to surrender to U.S. imperialism. They accuse those who dare to resist U.S. imperialism of wanting to provoke a third world war. They also say that the Vietnamese patriots resisting U.S. aggression are foolish. The article then points out that the Khrushchev revisionists are shamelessly promoting a surrender line and a policy of complete betrayal. On the Vietnam issue, they have become the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

The article states that for the Soviet revisionist leadership, there is no longer any anti-imperialist struggle to defend world peace. For them, there is only a complete surrender line.

    缅甸作家揭露苏修利用世界和平理事会推行投降路线
    据新华社地拉那四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》四日发表观察家文章，严厉谴责苏联修正主义同美帝国主义和罗马教皇保罗六世紧密勾结，鼓吹所谓“欧洲安全”和“欧洲团结”。
    文章说，苏修领导集团及其追随者热烈欢迎罗马教皇四月二十九日所表示的支持建立在东西方国家靠拢的基础的“欧洲团结”的观点。这一点也得到了美帝国主义者的默许。
    文章强调指出，梵蒂冈、美帝国主义和现代修正主义之间已经建立了紧密的合作。十分清楚，罗马教皇鼓吹的“欧洲团结”和苏修领导集团鼓吹的“欧洲安全”，都是帝国主义和修正主义共同计划的一个部分。其目的是要在欧洲搞缓和，以便把国际反动力量的精力转向亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民，首先是反对社会主义最强大的堡垒和一切革命力量在反对帝国主义和反动派斗争中的最可靠的支柱——中华人民共和国。
    文章说，但是，美帝国主义、修正主义和罗马教皇的“神圣的三位一体”骗不了欧洲各国人民。欧洲各国人民现在已经懂得，美帝国主义者对亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民进行暴力镇压，以及赫鲁晓夫、铁托修正主义者从内部破坏亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的革命正义斗争，同样也是对付欧洲各国人民的。
    文章说，在不断加强和巩固的马克思列宁主义政党和小组的领导下，欧洲各国工人、农民和先进的知识分子，正在日益积极地投入反对帝国主义和修正主义的革命斗争。现在，他们并不把自己争取经济条件和社会权利的斗争同反对帝国主义者及其仆从侵略越南和镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民的斗争分割开来。
    据新华社仰光四日电　缅甸作家杜阿玛四日在《人民报》上就苏联宣布颁发“加强国际和平”列宁国际奖金一事发表文章，揭露苏修领导集团利用列宁国际和平奖金，来推行它们的修正主义投降政策。
    文章说，在赫鲁晓夫修正主义的直接控制下，世界和平理事会已经堕落成为一个大事渲染核战争恐怖的投降主义机构。
    文章说：赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不让人们去反对美帝国主义，而要人们去向美帝国主义投降。他们指责那些敢于反对美帝国主义的人，说什么这些人要挑起第三次世界大战。他们还说什么抵抗美国侵略的越南爱国者是愚蠢的。文章接着指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在无耻地推行投降路线和彻头彻尾的背叛政策。在越南问题上，他们还充当了美帝国主义的头号帮凶。
    文章说，对苏修领导集团来说，不再有什么保卫世界和平的反帝斗争了。对他们来说，有的只是彻头彻尾的投降路线。
