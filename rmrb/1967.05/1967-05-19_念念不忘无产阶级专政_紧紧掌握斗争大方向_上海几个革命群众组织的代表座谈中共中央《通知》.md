In the great storm of the "January Revolution," the proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai created immortal achievements. They enthusiastically hailed the issuance of the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966. Some representatives of the revolutionary factions held a symposium on May 17 to study and discuss the great Marxist-Leninist document personally drafted by our great leader Chairman Mao. With boundless love, faith, and admiration for our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, they resolved to further raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget proletarian dictatorship, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Power is everything

Wang Hongwen, a leader of the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, said excitedly: Our great leader Chairman Mao is the great helmsman of the proletarian revolution. The great document he personally drafted, the May 16 Notification, smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of Peng Dehuai and their biggest backstage boss within the Party, who were plotting to seize the Party and the country and restore capitalism, and defended the great proletarian dictatorship. The Notification correctly pointed out that under proletarian dictatorship, the class struggle is concentrated on the issue of power, that is, the proletariat must consolidate proletarian dictatorship, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. Those who pose the greatest threat to proletarian dictatorship are those who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag and have infiltrated into the Party and government leadership organs, the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This points out the direction of our struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries fight to the death with the revolutionary forces, precisely to maintain their power." Our struggle to seize power from the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road fully proves that the proletarian revolutionaries must firmly grasp power in their own hands. When we raised high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism and thoroughly exposed those bourgeois representatives in various fields within the Party, government, military, and cultural circles, why did we suffer their frenzied counterattacks and brutal suppression, being labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," "anti-Party elements," and "rightists"? It is because they have power in their hands.

Why, when their doomsday came, did they dare to brazenly whip up a counter-revolutionary wind of economism, plotting and manufacturing the "three stops" incident of stopping water, electricity, and transportation, sabotaging the national economy and people's livelihood? It is still because they have power in their hands. These facts make us understand even more that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. With power, we have everything; without power, we lose everything. Based on this logic, we, the proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai, united to seize power from the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, firmly grasping the political, economic, and cultural power of Shanghai in our own hands, and established the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ—the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's theory of proletarian dictatorship and a great victory for the correct direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as pointed out in the Notification.

Always grasp the direction of struggle

Chen Qihua, a leader of the Shanghai Municipal Committee Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Station, said: The issuance of the Notification once again reminds us that at any time and under any circumstances, we must not forget and deviate from the direction of struggle. The Notification points out, "The purpose of this great struggle is to criticize Wu Han and other large numbers of anti-Party, anti-socialist bourgeois representatives (there are such bourgeois representatives in the central government and various central organs, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions)." In the past, we proletarian revolutionaries firmly grasped this direction of struggle and seized the power of the Party, government, finance, and culture from the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. After the proletarian revolutionaries seized power, they must grasp the direction of struggle. This is a major issue concerning whether proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated and whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can achieve thorough victory. At present, we must combine the great criticism of the biggest clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our own units. This is the direction of struggle. Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress. If we do not thoroughly criticize and expose the entire set of revisionist goods of the biggest clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, our Cultural Revolution cannot achieve thorough victory. Only by firmly grasping the direction of struggle can we achieve thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. We proletarian revolutionaries must constantly overcome various non-proletarian thoughts within our ranks, overcome individualism, sectarianism, and anarchism, unite under the premise of a unified direction, achieve great unity in the great criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison of the biggest clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in various fields, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The proletariat must grasp its own propaganda tools

Shao Chuanlie, a leader of the Revolutionary Committee of the Wenhui Daily, said: The Notification sounded the charge for the proletariat to launch a general offensive against the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, and the news industry is an important battlefield in this life-and-death class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a government, public opinion must first be created, and ideological work must first be done. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." Whichever class holds the newspaper, it serves that class. The compilers of the "Outline for Wenhui" and their biggest backstage boss, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, used the newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and other propaganda tools they controlled to create counter-revolutionary public opinion and public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. The Wenhui Daily had several times degenerated into their evil tool. We proletarian revolutionaries of the Wenhui Daily, following Chairman Mao's teachings, seized power from the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the world-shaking "January Revolution" red storm, giving the Wenhui Daily new life.

We understand that newspapers are tools of class struggle. The newspaper of the proletarian revolutionaries is to dare to speak for the proletarian revolutionaries, firmly stand on one side, with clear banners, sharp and fierce, dare to stir up the "wasp's nest" of class struggle, and fear no opposition. We did this, greatly boosting the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries, greatly dampening the arrogance of the bourgeoisie, and playing a promoting role in the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai. Of course, after the proletarian revolutionaries took power, the struggle did not end but continued in new forms. All revolutionary comrades of the Wenhui Daily are determined to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, strive to use Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of running the newspaper, and follow the direction indicated by the Notification to fight, always stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, truly turn the newspaper into an important battlefield for propagating and defending Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and make the newspaper the mouthpiece of proletarian dictatorship.

Seriously study the Notification, do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation

Many red guards in Shanghai schools followed Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasped the direction indicated by the Notification, and achieved great unity through revolutionary criticism. Recently, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Municipal Higher Education Red Guards Association and the red guards of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School, who achieved great unity in the great criticism, pointed out at the symposium: The brilliant document personally drafted by Chairman Mao has great practical and historical significance. They said, at present, it is a critical moment for the decisive battle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." We must, together with the broad revolutionary masses, concentrate our firepower to thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and eliminate their poison in various fields. The young revolutionaries expressed: The victories we have achieved so far are only preliminary, our tasks are still heavy, and the struggle is still arduous. The road is long and the mission is heavy. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the Notification as our action guide, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly overthrow the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois academic "authorities," build the school into a red Mao Zedong Thought school, and cultivate ourselves into revolutionary successors who are forever loyal to the Party, the people, Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and proletarian dictatorship.

    念念不忘无产阶级专政　紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    上海几个革命群众组织的代表座谈中共中央《通知》
    本报讯　在伟大的“一月革命”风暴中创立了不朽功勋的上海市无产阶级革命派，热烈欢呼中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》的发表。一些革命派的代表，怀着无比激动的心情，在十七日举行座谈会，学习和讨论了由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的这个伟大的马克思列宁主义文件。大家怀着对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰和无限崇拜，决心进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘无产阶级专政，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    有了政权，就有了一切
    上海工人革命造反总司令部负责人王洪文激动地说：我们伟大领袖毛主席是无产阶级革命的伟大舵手。他老人家亲自主持制定的《通知》这个伟大文件，粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团及其总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的阴谋，捍卫了伟大的无产阶级专政。《通知》英明地指出了在无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。对无产阶级专政危害最大的是那些打着红旗反红旗，混进党和政府领导机关内部的走资本主义道路的当权派。这给我们指明了斗争的大方向。毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”我们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的斗争充分证明，无产阶级革命派一定要牢牢地把政权掌握在自己手里。当我们高举无产阶级革命的批判大旗，彻底揭露那批混进党里、政府里、军队里和文化领域的各界里的资产阶级代表人物的时候，为什么遭到他们的疯狂反扑，残酷镇压，被他们打成“反革命”、“反党分子”、“右派分子”，就是因为他们手中有权。
    为什么当他们末日来临的时候，竟敢丧心病狂地大刮反革命经济主义妖风，策划制造停水、停电、停交通的“三停”事件，破坏国计民生，还是因为他们手里有权。这些事实使我们更加懂得了革命的根本问题是政权问题。有了政权就有了一切，丧失政权就丧失了一切。根据这个道理，我们上海市无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权，把上海市的政治、经济、文化的大权，牢牢地掌握在自己的手里，建立了革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构——上海市革命委员会。这是毛主席的无产阶级专政学说的伟大胜利，是《通知》所指出的无产阶级文化大革命正确方向的伟大胜利。
    任何时候都要紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    上海市委机关造反派联络站负责人程绮华说：《通知》的发表，又一次提醒我们，在任何时候、任何情况下，都不能忘记和离开斗争的大方向。《通知》指出，“这场大斗争的目的是对吴晗及其他一大批反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物（中央和中央各机关，各省、市、自治区，都有这样一批资产阶级代表人物）的批判。”过去我们无产阶级革命派紧紧掌握住这个斗争的大方向，从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺回了党、政、财、文大权。无产阶级革命派夺权以后，更要掌握斗争的大方向。这是关系到无产阶级专政能不能巩固、无产阶级文化大革命能不能取得彻底胜利的重大问题。当前，我们一定要把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，同本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，这是斗争的大方向。不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行。如果不把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一整套修正主义货色，彻底批倒、批臭，我们的文化大革命就不能取得彻底胜利。只有紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，才能巩固无产阶级专政。我们无产阶级革命派要不断克服自己队伍中的各种非无产阶级思想，克服个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义，在大方向一致的前提下，团结起来，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，彻底肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在各个领域内的流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    无产阶级要掌握好自己的舆论工具
    《文汇报》革命委员会负责人邵传烈说：《通知》吹响了无产阶级在意识形态领域里向资产阶级发动总攻击的进军号，而新闻界是这场你死我活的阶级斗争的重要阵地。毛主席教导我们：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”报纸掌握在那个阶级手里，就为那个阶级服务。《汇报提纲》的炮制者以及他们的总后台党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，就是通过他们控制的报纸、杂志、电台等宣传工具，大造反革命舆论，大造资本主义复辟舆论。《文汇报》曾经几次堕落为他们的罪恶工具。我们《文汇报》的无产阶级革命派，根据毛主席的教导，在震撼世界的“一月革命”的红色风暴中，夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，使《文汇报》获得了新生。
    我们懂得，报纸是阶级斗争的工具。无产阶级革命派的报纸，就是要敢于为无产阶级革命派讲话，坚决一边倒，旗帜鲜明，尖锐泼辣，敢于?阶级斗争的“马蜂窝”，不怕有人反对。我们这样做了，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风，对上海无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争起了推动作用。当然，在无产阶级革命派掌权以后，斗争不是结束了，而是以新的形式进行着。我们《文汇报》全体革命同志决心活学活用毛主席著作，努力用毛泽东思想作为办报的灵魂，按照《通知》指引的方向去斗争，永远倒向无产阶级革命派一边，真正把报纸办成宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想、宣传和捍卫毛主席的革命路线的重要阵地，使报纸成为无产阶级专政的喉舌。
     认真学好《通知》，搞好斗批改
    上海不少学校的红卫兵小将，遵循毛主席的教导，紧紧掌握《通知》指引的大方向，通过革命的大批判，实现了革命的大联合。不久前成立的上海市大专院校红代会筹委会负责人邬松年和在大批判中实现革命的大联合的上海市第六女子中学红卫兵团负责人王雪芳，在座谈会上都指出：毛主席亲自主持制定的这一光辉文件，具有伟大的现实意义和历史意义。他们说，目前，正是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线进行决战的关键时刻，我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”我们要和广大革命群众一起，集中火力把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透、批倒、批臭，肃清他们在各个领域的流毒。革命小将们表示：现在已经取得的胜利还仅仅是初步的，我们的任务还很重，斗争还很艰巨。任重而道远。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，把《通知》作为行动指南，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底斗倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”，把学校建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，把自己培养成为永远忠于党，忠于人民，忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于无产阶级专政的革命接班人。
