Our great leader Chairman Mao personally directed the formulation of the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, which has now been publicly issued. This is a major event in the political life of our 700 million people, and a major event in the international communist movement. We enthusiastically hail the publication of this great historical document!

This Notification is the first program of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In this great historical document, in his series of great works and instructions, and in his personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has correctly solved the theoretical and practical problems of carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. This is a brilliant development of Marxism-Leninism in an epoch-making sense. It is a new milestone in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism, marking the development of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent years, Chairman Mao has often instructed us that the question of who wins and who loses in the revolution can only be settled over a very long historical period. If things are not handled properly, the restoration of capitalism may occur at any time. In this document of great historical significance, Chairman Mao once again clearly points out: "Those in authority taking the capitalist road at the highest level of the Party and the government are themselves a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao's instructions clearly tell us that throughout the entire socialist period, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road, is long-term, complex, and sharp. The focus of this struggle is the question of power. After the proletariat seizes power, it is still possible to lose it. The handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies hidden within our ranks. We must consolidate our power, while they attempt to usurp it. This is an antagonistic contradiction, a struggle to the death. Only by practicing great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat and mobilizing the masses from below can we continually drive out these counter-revolutionary revisionists and raise the awareness of the broad masses in preventing and opposing revisionism. Only in this way can the dictatorship of the proletariat be consolidated and not be lost.

Comrade Lin Biao instructs us that with power, the proletariat and the working people have everything. Without power, they lose everything. No matter how many things there are to do, never forget about power. Forgetting about power is forgetting the fundamental viewpoint of Marxism. That is being confused, losing one's head without knowing how it happened.

In the 17 years since our liberation, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat over the seizure and counter-seizure of power has been extremely sharp. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed a large number of shocking facts, indicating that the Chinese Khrushchev is right by our side. Under his protection, in some places and departments, our power has been quietly usurped by a handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. These bad elements, under the guise of red flags, actually practice bourgeois dictatorship. They use the partial power they have stolen to engage in activities aimed at restoring capitalism, attempting to seize national power and change the color of the entire country. Now, the broad revolutionary masses have exposed the biggest handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and have exposed one by one the Khrushchev-style characters, big and small. This is the greatest victory achieved in the past year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Our army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will certainly collude with the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the army to usurp the military power of the proletariat. Another leader of the Peng Dehuai counter-revolutionary revisionist clique was a counter-revolutionary revisionist who had usurped important military leadership positions. This counter-revolutionary revisionist is a conspirator and an ambitious plotter who opposes the Party, opposes socialism, and opposes Mao Zedong Thought. He opposes Chairman Mao's military line and the series of instructions by Comrade Lin Biao on emphasizing politics; he stubbornly pushes the bourgeois military line; he colludes with the biggest handful of those in authority within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, forms cliques, and engages in conspiracies to usurp the military and counter the Party, attempting to seize our power and restore capitalism once conditions are ripe. Under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought, this counter-revolutionary two-faced character was quickly exposed and his conspiracy to usurp the military and counter the Party was smashed. This is the first great victory of our army's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory in consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. The facts once again prove that any conspiracy by the class enemy to usurp the military and counter the Party will fail and will result in a bloody nose. The great people's army, personally created by the great commander Chairman Mao and directly led by Vice Commander Lin Biao, is a highly politically conscious army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao.

Our army is the most important tool of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without a people's army, there can be no dictatorship of the proletariat. The comrades in our army must heighten their class vigilance. The leadership of any department or unit in our army must not be usurped by counter-revolutionary revisionists, by bourgeois conspirators and ambitious plotters. The people's guns must forever be in the hands of proletarian revolutionaries who are loyal to Chairman Mao and to Mao Zedong Thought.

The comrades in our army must be concerned with national affairs and never forget the question of power. Not only must they be ready at any time to smash external enemies who openly use force to seize our power, but they must also seriously pay attention to the internal power struggle of those in authority who are taking the capitalist road. In places where the leadership has been usurped, we must, together with the broad revolutionary masses, firmly seize power from those in authority who are taking the capitalist road and help the proletarian revolutionary factions to hold and use power properly.

Chairman Mao points out: The current cultural revolution is only the first one; in the future, there will necessarily be more. All Party members and the people of the entire nation should not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will bring eternal peace. Be extremely vigilant and never relax. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's instruction, fully recognize the long-term nature of class struggle in the socialist period, and fully recognize the long-term nature of the struggle against restoration and for preventing restoration under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

All comrades in the army should enthusiastically respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, seriously study the May 16 Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, this document of great historical significance, further understand Chairman Mao's theory and practice on carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism, further understand and grasp the theory, line, principles, and policies of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, carry forward the spirit of the proletariat's continuous revolution, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, carry the socialist revolution through to the end, and ensure that our proletarian heaven remains unchanging for ten thousand generations.

### 永远不要忘记政权

    永远不要忘记政权
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，公开发表了。这是我国七亿人民政治生活中的一件大事，是国际共产主义运动中的一件大事。我们热烈欢呼这个伟大历史文献的发表！
    这个《通知》，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的第一个纲领。毛主席在这个伟大历史文件中，在他的一系列伟大著作和指示中，在他亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中，正确地解决了无产阶级专政下进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，是对马克思列宁主义划时代的光辉发展。这是马克思列宁主义发展史上的一个新的里程碑，标志着马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段。
    毛主席近几年经常教导我们，革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。在这个具有伟大历史意义的文件中，毛主席又明确指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    毛主席的这些指示，清楚地告诉我们，在整个社会主义时期，无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间的斗争，是长期的，复杂的，尖锐的。这个斗争的焦点，是政权问题。无产阶级取得了政权以后，还可能丧失政权。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是钻进我们肝脏里最危险的敌人。我们要巩固自己的政权，他们要篡夺我们的政权，这是对抗性的矛盾，是你死我活的斗争。只有实行无产阶级专政下的大民主，自下而上地广泛地发动群众，才能够把这些反革命修正主义分子不断地清除出去，才能够在斗争中提高广大群众防修反修的觉悟。这样，无产阶级政权才能巩固，才不会丢掉。
    林彪同志指示我们，有了政权，无产阶级、劳动人民就有了一切。没有政权，就丧失一切。无论怎样千头万绪的事，永远不要忘记政权。忘记了政权，就是忘记了马克思主义的根本观点。那就是糊涂人，脑袋掉了，还不知道怎么掉的。
    我国解放十七年来，资产阶级同无产阶级之间的夺权反夺权的斗争，是十分尖锐的。无产阶级文化大革命中所揭发的大量的触目惊心的事实表明，中国的赫鲁晓夫就睡在我们身边，在他的庇护下，一些地方，一些部门，我们的大权已经被党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派悄悄地篡夺了。这些坏家伙打着红旗反红旗，挂着无产阶级专政的招牌，实际上对我们实行了资产阶级专政。他们利用已经窃取的部分政权，大搞资本主义复辟活动，妄图夺取全国的政权，改变整个国家的颜色。现在，广大革命群众把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭露出来了，把大大小小的赫鲁晓夫式的人物一个一个揭露出来了。这是一年来无产阶级文化大革命所取得的最重大的胜利。
    我们军队是无产阶级专政的柱石。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，要篡夺无产阶级政权，就一定要同混进军队里的资产阶级代表人物勾结起来，篡夺无产阶级的军权。彭真反革命修正主义集团的另一个头目，就是曾经窃踞了重要军事领导职务的反革命修正主义分子。这个反革命修正主义分子，是一个反对党，反对社会主义，反对毛泽东思想的阴谋家、野心家。他反对毛主席的军事路线，反对林彪同志关于突出政治等一系列的指示，顽固地推行资产阶级军事路线；他和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派互相勾结，结党营私，进行篡军反党的阴谋活动，妄图一旦时机成熟，夺取我们的政权，实行资本主义复辟。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，这个反革命两面派很快就被识破了，被揭露出来了，他的篡军反党阴谋被粉碎了，这是我军无产阶级文化大革命第一个伟大的胜利，是巩固无产阶级专政的大胜利，是毛泽东思想的一个大胜利。事实又一次证明，任何阶级敌人的篡军反党阴谋都不能得逞，都要碰得头破血流。伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的、毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅直接领导的伟大的人民军队，是具有高度政治觉悟的、无限忠于毛主席的军队。
    我们军队是无产阶级专政最重要的工具。没有一个人民的军队，就谈不上无产阶级专政。我们军队的同志一定要把阶级警惕性提得高高的。我们军队任何部门、任何单位的领导权，都决不能让反革命修正主义分子，让资产阶级的阴谋家、野心家篡夺了去。人民的枪杆子，一定要永远掌握在忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命者手里。
    我们军队的同志要关心国家大事，念念不忘政权问题。不但要随时准备粉碎外部敌人明火执仗地用武力来夺取我们的政权，而且要严重注意内部的走资本主义道路的当权派悄悄地窃取我们的政权。在那些被篡夺了领导权的地方，我们一定要和广大革命群众一起，坚决从走资本主义道路当权派手里把权夺回来，并且帮助无产阶级革命派掌好权，用好权。
    毛主席指出：现在的文化大革命，仅仅是第一次，以后还必然要进行多次。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。我们要牢牢记住毛主席这个指示，充分认识社会主义时期阶级斗争的长期性，充分认识无产阶级专政条件下复辟反复辟斗争的长期性。
    全军同志要热烈响应党中央的号召，认真地学习中共中央《通知》这个具有伟大历史意义的文献，进一步领会毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，发扬无产阶级不断革命的精神，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把社会主义革命进行到底，使我们无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色。
                                              （五月二十日）
