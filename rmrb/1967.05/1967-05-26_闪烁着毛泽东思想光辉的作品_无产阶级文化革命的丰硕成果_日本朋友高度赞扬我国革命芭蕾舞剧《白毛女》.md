Two Japanese ballet dancers recently co-wrote an article praising China's revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" as a brilliant work by Chinese revolutionary cultural workers who have implemented the great thought of Mao Zedong.

The two dancers are Kaki Jianzi and Dalizi. They had the opportunity to watch the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" performed by the Shanghai Dance School while visiting China with the Matsuyama Ballet Troupe in September and October of last year. Their co-written article was published in an issue of the organ of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, "Japan-China Cultural Exchange."

The article points out that the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is an outstanding work created by Chinese revolutionary cultural workers in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The article believes that the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," as a new achievement of the Chinese people in the proletarian cultural revolution, as a precious first-class work in the world, should be highly evaluated.

In discussing the high ideological nature of the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl," the article says, "It vividly and profoundly depicts the sharp class struggle in rural China during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and successfully portrays the brave spirit of resistance and revolutionary fearlessness of the poor and lower-middle peasants in rural China."

The article states that the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has also achieved success in the nationalization of ballet. The article points out that ballet is originally a Western classical art, but the revolutionary modern ballet "The White-Haired Girl" "has absorbed the good elements of the inherent techniques and skills of ballet, discarded those that do not meet the demands of the times and are unnecessary, and at the same time has absorbed the actions, expressions, and techniques of traditional Chinese drama and dance."

The article states, "We deeply feel that to make ballet truly a popular art that the masses love to see and hear, it is important to further improve one's ideological awareness and learn from the Chinese revolutionary cultural workers who wholeheartedly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers."

    闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的作品  无产阶级文化革命的丰硕成果
    日本朋友高度赞扬我国革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》
    据新华社讯　日本两位芭蕾舞演员不久前合写一篇文章，赞扬中国革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是中国革命文艺工作者贯彻伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉作品。
    这两位演员是柿治田鹤子和大丽子。她们曾在去年九、十月间随松山芭蕾舞团代表团访问中国期间，观看了上海舞蹈学校表演的革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》。她们合写的文章刊登在一期日中文化交流协会的机关刊物《日中文化交流》上。
    文章指出，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》是中国革命文艺工作者根据毛泽东主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的精神编演的杰出的作品。文章认为，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，作为中国人民进行无产阶级文化大革命取得的新成就，作为宝贵的世界上第一流的作品，应当给予高度的评价。
    文章在谈到革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》的高度思想性时说，它“生动地和深刻地表现了抗日战争时期中国农村的尖锐的阶级斗争，而且成功地描写了中国农村中贫下中农勇敢的反抗精神和革命的大无畏精神。”
    文章说，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》在实行芭蕾舞的民族化方面也获得了成功。文章指出，芭蕾舞本来是西方的古典艺术，但是，革命现代芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》“吸收了芭蕾舞固有的手法和技巧中的好的东西，去掉了不合乎时代要求和不需要的东西，同时还吸收了中国传统的戏剧舞蹈的动作、表情和手法等。”
    文章说，我们深切地感到，要使芭蕾舞真正成为广大群众喜闻乐见的艺术，重要的是需要进一步提高自己的思想觉悟，向全心全意为工农兵服务的中国的革命文艺工作者学习。
