The liberation armed forces of Quang Tri – Thua Thien in South Vietnam have been continuously inflicting heavy blows on the U.S. aggressors who have invaded this region since the beginning of this year, achieving great victories. On March 7, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. artillery positions on Hill 241 in Quang Tri Province, annihilating 1,500 enemy troops and destroying 20 cannons in one go.

The U.S. Fortress Heavily Fortified

Hill 241 is a strategic base of the U.S. aggressors on Highway 9 and a fortress in their northeastern defense line in Quang Tri Province. The U.S. bandits have stationed two artillery battalions equipped with 30 105mm, 155mm, and 175mm cannons, and two armored car companies here. The command post of the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Marine Division is also located here.

Since last summer, especially after the liberation army annihilated the enemy's artillery positions at Cam Lo and Thanh last August, the U.S. aggressors have been continuously taking hits on Highway 9. Therefore, they attempted to fortify Hill 241 into a solid position. The enemy constructed a defensive line outside each artillery position using dozens of tanks and armored cars. Outside this line, there are layers of barbed wire and mined areas.

Surrounding Hill 241, the enemy also set up a series of outlying strongholds such as Cam Lo, New Forest, and others.

The enemy invested so much effort in fortifying this position to control a 1,300-square-kilometer area from Dong River in the east to Gia Lu in the west, from Ba Lon in the south to the southern bank of the Ben Hai River. They also intended to use Hill 241 to cover the "sweeping" enemy troops with cannons, tanks, and armored cars, destroying the liberated areas in western Quang Tri.

The Flames of Revenge Burn Furiously

The cowardly U.S. bandits thought that with such a tightly defended position on Hill 241, they could rest easy. However, they could not have foreseen that their fate was already in the hands of the liberation army of Quang Tri Province.

Around 10 PM on March 7, 1967, the liberation army's artillery units participating in the attack on Hill 241, with the assistance of the guerrilla forces, were making the final preparations for the battle.

Inside the position, the liberation army soldiers, seeing the enemy ahead, were all burning with rage. It was these very bandits who had brought countless disasters to the people of Quang Tri Province. Now, they were within the range of the people's soldiers' artillery fire, and the time for revenge had come.

Hill 241 was engulfed in darkness, with only occasional flashes of light from the enemy's flashlights and the tracers of blindly fired artillery shells.

At 11 PM, the order to attack was transmitted from the command post. The liberation army's artillery roared to life. Streaks of red light pierced the pitch-black night sky. The continuous boom of cannons echoed. The shells accurately landed on the enemy's positions.

The U.S. bandits, caught off guard by the sudden and fierce attack, were in disarray. The defensive system of Hill 241 fell into chaos. The liberation army's first volley of artillery fire destroyed the enemy's communication center. The frightened U.S. aggressors were pushing and shoving each other, scrambling into the air-raid shelters. But they could not escape the liberation army's punishment! Hill 241 turned into a sea of fire, burning the U.S. bandits and many of their heavy cannons, tanks, and armored cars to ashes.

The Artillery Pounded and Completely Destroyed

After the first volley of artillery fire, the surviving enemy thought they had escaped danger. But when they crawled out of their fortifications, the liberation army's second volley of artillery fire came again. Hill 241 was once again engulfed in flames. This time, the explosions on the enemy's positions were louder, and the fire burned more fiercely. The liberation army's reconnaissance personnel saw in the firelight that the enemy's positions were almost completely leveled.

As dawn broke, when the surviving enemy crawled out of their fortifications, the liberation army suddenly began the third round of artillery bombardment. This time, the bombardment hit Hill 241 with overwhelming force. The number of casualties among the U.S. troops on the hill doubled. All the barracks of the U.S. troops on the hill were destroyed, and the enemy's ammunition depot exploded continuously throughout the morning.

That night, the people of Cam Lo and the vicinity of Highway 9 saw Hill 241, which was bombarded by the liberation army's artillery, engulfed in flames. They saw the U.S. aggressors, who had been brutally killing and persecuting the people, receiving severe punishment, and they all rejoiced.

The victory of the liberation armed forces of Quang Tri Province in destroying the enemy's artillery positions on Hill 241 and the victories in attacking U.S. bases such as Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Yutap, have made the U.S. and puppet troops panic-stricken and restless.

Due to the continuous heavy blows, the morale of the puppet troops has further deteriorated, and more and more of them are deserting. The 6th Battalion of the puppet marine corps, which had just arrived in Dong Ha from Saigon, had about 100 deserters. There were also hundreds of puppet police who fled from Hue.

The liberation armed forces' artillery strike is a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors' plot to "defend" the western line of Highway 9.

The enemy's Hill 241 has been annihilated. The enemy's other positions will not escape the same fate.

    把美军基地变成美军坟场
    ——记南越解放军在非军事区以南猛攻美军二四一高地的战斗
    越南南方广治—承天解放武装力量从今年年初以来连续给予进驻这个地区的美国侵略军以沉重打击，取得很大胜利。三月七日，解放武装力量以猛烈的炮火，进攻广治省境内二四一高地美军炮兵阵地，一举歼敌一千五百名，击毁大炮二十门。
    美军要塞层层设防
    二四一高地是美国侵略者在九号公路上的战略基地，也是他们在广治省东北部防线上的一个要塞。美国强盗在这里驻扎了装备有三十门一○五、一五五、一七五毫米大炮的两个炮兵营和两个装甲车支团。美国海军陆战队第九师第三团的指挥所也设在这里。
    从去年夏天，特别是去年八月底解放军消灭甘露西面的和成敌军炮兵阵地以来，美国侵略军在九号公路不断挨打，因此，它们妄图把二四一高地修建成一个牢固的阵地。敌人在各个炮位的外面用成十辆坦克、装甲车构成了一道防线，在这道防线的外面，还有重重的铁丝网和布雷地带。
    环绕着二四一高地敌人还布置了一系列外围据点：如甘露、新林等等。
    敌人花了这样大的力量来苦心经营，就是企图利用这个阵地来控制从东面的东河到西面的贾鲁、从南面的巴隆到边海河南岸的方圆一千三百平方公里的地区，并利用二四一高地，以大炮、坦克、装甲车掩护“扫荡”的敌人，破坏广治西部的解放区。
    复仇怒火熊熊燃烧
    怕死的美国强盗以为二四一高地防御这样严密他们就可以高枕无忧。但是，美国强盗那能料到他们的命运已经掌握在广治省解放军的手里。
    一九六七年三月七日晚十时左右，参加攻击二四一高地的解放军炮兵部队在游击队的协助下，正紧张地进行战斗的最后准备。
    在阵地里，解放军战士望见前面的敌人，个个怒火中烧。正是这帮家伙给广治省人民带来了无数的灾难。现在，他们已经在人民战士的炮火的射程之内，报仇的时刻已经到来。
    二四一高地淹没在黑夜里，只是不时有敌人打的手电的亮光和盲目发射的炮弹的曳光。
    十一时，进攻的命令从指挥所传达下来。解放军的炮火打响了。一道道红光划破漆黑的夜空。??的炮声连续不断。炮弹准确地落到敌人的阵地上。
    美国强盗遭到突然和猛烈的袭击，不知所措。二四一高地的防御系统陷入一片混乱。解放军的第一轮炮火就把敌人的通讯中心摧毁。吓破胆的美国侵略军这时都你推我拥地争着往防空洞里钻。但是，也逃不脱解放军的惩罚！二四一高地变成了一片火海，把美国强盗和他们的许多重型大炮、坦克、装甲车烧成灰烬。
    排炮猛轰彻底摧毁
    第一轮炮火过后，残存的敌人以为脱险了，但当他们从工事里爬出来时，解放军的第二轮炮火又打来了，二四一高地又一次陷入火海之中。这次敌阵上的爆炸声比上一次更响，火势也比上一次烧得更猛烈。解放军侦察员在火光中看到敌人阵地差不多全部被夷平了。
    天刚亮，当残存的敌人爬出工事，解放军又突然开始进行第三次炮轰。这次炮轰以翻天覆地之势压向二四一高地。阵地上美军伤亡增加了一倍。高地上美军所有的营房全部被摧毁，敌人的弹药库也在整个上午爆炸不停。
    当天夜里，甘露和九号公路附近的人民看到被解放军炮轰得火光冲天的二四一高地，看到平日野蛮屠杀、迫害人民的二四一高地的美国侵略军遭到严厉的惩罚，无不拍手称快。
    广治省解放武装力量摧毁二四一高地敌军炮兵阵地的胜利和袭击岘港、朱莱、育庙等美军基地的胜利，使美伪军丧魂落魄，坐立不安。
    由于连续遭到沉重打击，伪军士气更加低落，开小差的越来越多。伪海军陆战队第六营刚从西贡开到东河就有约一百人开了小差。犹灵也有成百名伪警察逃走。
    解放武装力量的这次炮击，是对美国侵略者企图“保卫”第九号公路西面防线的阴谋的一次沉重打击。
    敌人二四一高地已经被消灭。敌人其他的一切阵地，将逃脱不了被消灭的命运。
