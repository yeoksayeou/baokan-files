Black Americans in New York and other cities are establishing militant organizations and actively engaging in protests against the Vietnam War.

	NEW YORK, May 9 (Xinhua) — As the U.S. imperialists continue to escalate the war in Vietnam, an increasing number of Black Americans are joining the ranks opposing the Vietnam War. This development has caused considerable concern among the U.S. ruling class, who are already reeling from defeats inflicted by the Vietnamese people.

	According to U.S. media reports, in recent months, anti-Vietnam War activities among Black American youth have been intensifying, particularly in prominent Black universities such as Fisk University in Nashville, Howard University in Washington, and Morehouse College in Atlanta. At Howard University, after driving away the recruitment officer Hershey in March, Black students organized another protest in late April with over 400 participants, condemning the school's attempt to illegally investigate the incident. Protesters burned an effigy of Hershey. Meanwhile, in predominantly white universities, Black student groups with a strong fighting spirit have been formed to initiate protest activities.

	Anti-Vietnam War activities among Black communities in various U.S. cities are also rapidly expanding. For example, in New York's Harlem district, the first anti-Vietnam War rally organized by the newly formed "Black United Front" in June last year attracted around 200 participants. This year, on April 15, the group organized a protest march in Harlem with over 1,000 participants. During this period, many Black organizations actively joined the anti-war efforts. A group called "Angry Black Women" frequently protested in front of the Harlem recruitment center and distributed anti-war leaflets. Other Black anti-war groups in New York, such as the "Black Against Genocide Organization" in Brooklyn and the "Afro-American Life Patrol" in the Bronx, are increasingly coordinating their efforts with activists in Harlem.

	According to a recent statement by the deputy chairman of the Progressive Labor Party, Epton, there are now very few Black soldiers in uniform in Harlem because the broad Black community opposes fighting for white rulers. Epton also revealed that similar developments are occurring in other U.S. cities. The "Black United Front" is being established in Baltimore and Dayton (Ohio); additionally, Black anti-Vietnam War organizations have been formed in Atlanta, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, and other cities.

	U.S. bourgeois media, in commenting on Black Americans' opposition to the Vietnam War, have expressed particular concern that the Black movement "may truly form some kind of alliance with the anti-war movement," thereby further shifting the Black movement to the left.

	These developments are, of course, a significant cause for concern for the U.S. ruling class, which is increasingly mired in the Vietnam War quagmire. Although Blacks make up only 10% of the U.S. population, they constitute nearly 25% of U.S. troops in Vietnam, and in the paratrooper units with the highest casualties, Blacks account for 40%. An increasing number of Black youth have declared their determination to stay at home and fight for their own rights, preferring jail over going to South Vietnam to kill their brothers. The growing awakening of the Black community will thwart the U.S. ruling class's plans to send more Blacks to fight in the Vietnam War.

### 美国黑人联合起来反对侵越战争  纽约等地黑人纷纷建立战斗组织积极展开活动

    美国黑人联合起来反对侵越战争
    纽约等地黑人纷纷建立战斗组织积极展开活动
    新华社九日讯　华盛顿消息：随着美帝国主义在越南不断进行战争“升级”，越来越多的美国黑人正在投入反对侵越战争的行列。这个事实使得被越南人民打得焦头烂额的美国统治集团大为不安。
    据美国报刊报道，最近一个时期来，在一些著名的黑人大学里，美国黑人青年反对侵越战争的活动，一直在发展，特别是在纳什维尔的菲斯克大学、华盛顿的霍华德大学和亚特兰大的莫尔豪斯学院等学校里，情况更是如此。霍华德大学的黑人学生继三月间轰走前往这个学校搜罗侵越战争炮灰的征兵局长赫尔希之后，接着又在四月下旬再次举行有四百多人参加的示威，抗议校方企图对这次事件进行非法调查；示威者烧掉了一个模拟赫尔希的草人。同时，在一些白人占多数的大学内，目前成立了由黑人学生组成的富于战斗性的反对侵越战争的团体，准备开始抗议活动。
    黑人群众的反对侵越战争的活动，在美国各城市的黑人聚居区内更是迅速发展。例如在纽约的哈莱姆区，去年六月间由当时新成立的“黑人统一行动组织”召集的第一次反对侵越战争集会，有大约二百人参加；而这个团体今年四月十五日，在哈莱姆区组织的反对侵越战争的示威游行，参加人数超过了一千人。在这期间，许多黑人组织积极参加了反侵越的活动，一个名叫“愤怒的黑人妇女”的团体经常在哈莱姆征兵站前示威，并散发抗议传单。纽约市其他黑人区内的反战团体，例如布鲁克林区的“黑人反对坐以待毙组织”和布朗克斯的“非洲裔美国人求生存组织”，都越来越同哈莱姆区的活动分子互相配合进行斗争。
    据美国进步劳工党副主席埃普顿不久前指出，目前，在哈莱姆区，很少看到黑人士兵穿军装，因为广大黑人群众反对他们为白人统治者打仗。埃普顿还透露说，美国其他城市的黑人区目前也正在向哈莱姆学习；“黑人统一行动阵线”正在巴尔的摩和戴顿（俄亥俄州）建立起来；另外在亚特兰大、旧金山、洛杉矶、底特律、芝加哥、波士顿、费城和其他城市都先后成立了黑人反对侵越战争组织。
    美国资产阶级报刊在评论黑人反对侵越战争的活动时，特别表示担心黑人运动“可能真正同反战运动形成某种形式的联合”，从而使黑人运动进一步“向左摆动”。
    这些事实，对于在侵越战争的泥沼中越陷越深的美国统治集团来说，当然不能不引起极大的忧虑。黑人虽然在美国总人口中只占百分之十，但是在侵越美军中，黑人却占了将近百分之二十五，而在伤亡最大的伞兵部队中，黑人所占比例更达到了百分之四十。越来越多的黑人青年明确宣告，他们决心留在国内为争取自身权利而战斗，宁愿坐牢也不去南越屠杀自己的兄弟。黑人群众的日益觉醒将使美国统治集团驱使更多黑人替侵越战争卖命的打算遭到破产。
