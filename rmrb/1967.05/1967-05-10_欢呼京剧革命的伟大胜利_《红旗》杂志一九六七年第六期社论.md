The Peking Opera revolution has sounded the advance call for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, marking a great beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory for Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"!

The stage of drama is a very important battleground in the struggle between the two classes and two lines on the cultural front. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always attached great importance to this battleground. In 1944, after watching the Yan'an People's Art Theatre's performance of "Forced into Rebellion," Chairman Mao pointed out: "History is created by the people, but on the old stage (in all literature and art that are divorced from the people) the people are reduced to dregs, ruled over by masters, mistresses, young masters, and young ladies. This inversion of history is now being inverted again by you, restoring history to its true face. From now on, the old drama has a new look, and it is worth celebrating." Since the liberation of the whole country, Chairman Mao has again put forward the important policies of "Let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "learn from the past but serve the present, learn from abroad but serve China," and so on. Chairman Mao's instructions have solved a series of fundamental problems in the drama revolution and are the highest criteria for guiding the drama revolution.

Comrade Jiang Qing's speech at the Peking Opera Modern Drama Observation and Performance Conference in July 1964 expounded the great significance of the Peking Opera revolution with Mao Zedong Thought and elaborated on Chairman Mao's guiding principles for the Peking Opera revolution. This speech is an important document that uses Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to solve the problems of the Peking Opera revolution.

For a long time, under the domination of the revisionist line in the literary and artistic circles represented by Zhou Yang, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Lin Moquan, and others, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line could not be carried out in the Peking Opera art. On the Peking Opera stage, there were a large number of bad plays that sang the praises of emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties, which played a reactionary role in undermining the socialist economic base and paving the way for the restoration of capitalism.

A small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, along with some reactionary "authorities," have, relying on the power and position they have usurped, monopolized the Peking Opera circle, recruited traitors, formed cliques, and turned the Peking Opera circle into a feudal landlord and bourgeois independent kingdom that is impervious to water and needles.

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is the biggest pillar and backer of the bourgeois reactionary forces and all the ghosts and monsters in the Peking Opera circle. He has long been stubbornly opposed to the Peking Opera revolution, advocating that "old plays have great educational significance." He has greatly praised and promoted the philosophy of betrayal and the philosophy of survival in "The Orphan of Zhao," saying that this play "can be sung without harm, and after singing it for so many years, a new China has been sung out." He has praised "The Tiger Village," which beautifies the running dogs of the feudal landlords, as a "well-revised play." He even recommended the obscene and licentious Peking Opera "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix." Together with the revisionist heads of the former Beijing Municipal Committee, as well as Zhou Yang, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Lin Moquan, Tian Han, Zhang Geng, and others, he used old Peking Opera to carry out activities for the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration.

The new forces will inevitably triumph over the decaying ones. Under the brilliant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, and with the efforts of the revolutionary comrades in the Peking Opera circle, the revolutionary new Peking Opera has finally broken through numerous obstacles and emerged from the old stronghold of emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties.

The Peking Opera revolution has already produced a rich harvest. The appearance of model operas such as "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Port," "The Red Lantern," "Shajiabang," and "The Red Detachment of Women" is the most precious achievement. They are not only excellent models of Peking Opera but also excellent models of proletarian literature and art, and are also excellent models of "struggle, criticism, and transformation" on all fronts of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The brilliant achievements of the Peking Opera revolution are shaking the entire art stage like spring thunder, meaning that the proletarian hundred flowers are about to bloom! This will have an immeasurable influence and role on the development of the entire proletarian literature and art.

Not long ago, a small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road sneered at our Peking Opera revolutionary vanguard, saying, "Do you want to attack the stronghold?" Yes, we do want to attack the stronghold, to attack the most stubborn "fortress" in the art of drama, to seize this bastion, which is most tightly controlled by bourgeois reactionary forces, into the hands of the proletariat. Today, Peking Opera has broken through the prison of counter-revolutionary revisionism and has raised high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought on the opera stage, turning the stage that was once occupied by emperors, generals, and scholars and beauties into a stage where workers, peasants, and soldiers can show their talents; turning the stage that propagates feudalism and capitalism into a stage that propagates Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, a great transformation of heaven and earth. It shows the broad masses: the great Mao Zedong Thought is invincible, and even such a fortress as Peking Opera, which is most tightly controlled by counter-revolutionary revisionism and where the old forces are most stubborn, can be broken through, so what other old fortresses cannot be broken through?

The victory of the Peking Opera revolution has pronounced the bankruptcy of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line and has opened up a new era for the development of proletarian new literature and art.

The Peking Opera revolution is an important part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. We must highly evaluate the great achievements of the Peking Opera revolution and highly value the great historical significance of the Peking Opera revolution. Seeing the achievements and significance of the Peking Opera revolution will greatly enhance our confidence in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We are firmly convinced that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a completely new situation will emerge in the field of culture and art in our country, a situation of a hundred flowers blooming and everything flourishing.

    欢呼京剧革命的伟大胜利
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第六期社论
    京剧革命，吹响了我国无产阶级文化大革命的进军号，这是我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大开端。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的伟大胜利！
    戏剧阵地，是文艺战线上两个阶级、两条路线斗争的一个十分重要的阵地。我们伟大的领袖毛主席向来十分重视这个阵地。一九四四年，毛主席看了延安平剧院演出的《逼上梁山》后就指出：“历史是人民创造的，但在旧戏舞台上（在一切离开人民的旧文学旧艺术上）人民却成了渣滓，由老爷太太少爷小姐们统治着舞台，这种历史的颠倒，现在由你们再颠倒过来，恢复了历史的面目，从此旧剧开了新生面，所以值得庆贺。”全国解放以来，毛主席又提出了“百花齐放，推陈出新”，“古为今用，洋为中用”等重要方针。毛主席的指示，解决了戏剧革命的一系列根本问题，是指导戏剧革命的最高准则。
    江青同志一九六四年七月在京剧现代戏观摩演出人员座谈会上的讲话，用毛泽东思想阐述了京剧革命的伟大意义，发挥了毛主席的京剧革命的指导方针。这篇讲话，是运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想解决京剧革命问题的一个重要文件。
    长期以来，在以周扬、齐燕铭、夏衍、林默涵为代表的文艺界反革命修正主义路线的统治之下，毛主席的革命路线在京剧艺术中得不到贯彻。在京剧舞台上，大量充斥着歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人的坏戏，这些坏戏起着瓦解社会主义经济基础，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道的反动作用。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和一些反动“权威”的老爷们，仗着他们所窃取的权力和地位，把持京剧界，招降纳叛、结党营私，把京剧界变成一个水泼不进、针插不入的封建地主、资产阶级独立王国。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是京剧界资产阶级反动势力和一切牛鬼蛇神最大的支柱和靠山，是京剧革命一只最大的拦路虎。长期以来，他顽固地反对京剧革命，宣扬什么“老戏很有教育意义”。他大肆吹捧宣扬叛徒哲学、活命哲学的《四郎探母》，说什么这出戏“唱唱也不要紧，唱了这么多年，不是唱出个新中国吗？”他把极力美化封建地主走狗黄天霸之流的《恶虎村》，吹捧为“改得好的剧目”。他甚至向人们推荐下流淫荡的京剧《游龙戏凤》。他伙同前北京市委的反革命修正主义头头，以及周扬、齐燕铭、夏衍、林默涵、田汉、张庚之流，利用旧京戏，进行资本主义反革命复辟活动。
    新生的力量终究是要战胜腐朽的东西的。在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在江青同志的指导下，在京剧界广大革命同志的努力下，革命的新京剧终于冲破了重重阻力，从帝王将相、才子佳人的旧营垒中杀出来了。
    京剧革命已经出现了一批丰盛的果实。《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》等京剧样板戏的出现，就是最可宝贵的收获。它们不仅是京剧的优秀样板，而且是无产阶级文艺的优秀样板，也是无产阶级文化大革命各个阵地上的“斗批改”的优秀样板。京剧革命的这些辉煌成就象春雷一样地震动着整个艺术舞台，它意味着无产阶级的百花已经到了盛开的时节了！这对整个无产阶级文艺的发展，将起着不可估量的影响和作用。
    曾几何时，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派讥笑我们京剧革命的先锋战士说：“你们想攻坚？”是的，我们就是要攻坚，就是要攻这个戏剧艺术中最顽固的“堡垒”，要把这个被资产阶级反动势力统治得最严密的阵地，夺到无产阶级的手中。今天，京剧冲破了反革命修正主义的牢笼，在戏曲舞台上高高地树起了毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，把被帝王将相、才子佳人所盘踞的舞台，变为工农兵大显身手的舞台；把宣传封建主义、资本主义的阵地，变为宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，这是天翻地覆的伟大变革。它向广大群众指明：伟大的毛泽东思想是无坚不摧的，京剧这么一个为反革命修正主义控制得最严密、旧势力最顽固的堡垒都可以攻破，那么还有什么旧堡垒不能攻破呢？
    京剧革命的胜利，宣判了反革命修正主义文艺路线的破产，给无产阶级新文艺的发展开拓了一个崭新的纪元。
    京剧革命是我国无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要组成部分，我们必须高度估价京剧革命的巨大成就，高度重视京剧革命的重大历史意义。看清京剧革命的成就和意义，将大大增强我们对无产阶级文化大革命的信心。我们深信，经过无产阶级文化大革命，在我国文化艺术领域中，将出现一个历史上从来没有过的崭新的局面，将出现一片百花盛开的欣欣向荣的动人景象。
