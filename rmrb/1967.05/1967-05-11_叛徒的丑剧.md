Title: The Traitor's Farce

Edition: 6

The news has come that the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique intends to publish the reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago" by the traitorous writer Pasternak in the Soviet Union. This is yet another naked exposure of the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionists.

People remember that when this malicious novel, which viciously defamed the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat, was first published, it immediately received the enthusiastic applause of imperialists and reactionaries worldwide. At that time, the Soviet revisionist clique was forced to admit that it was a work "full of hatred for socialism," a "counter-revolutionary and defamatory" piece, and to admit that the author was a "traitor," a "scoundrel" of the Soviet people, and an "enemy of the revolution." Now, you are going to promote such a poisonous weed of anti-socialism and counter-revolution, spreading it widely and even erecting monuments and writing biographies for this traitor, scoundrel, and enemy of the revolution. Isn't this the clearest indication of what kind of people you are and what kind of tricks you are playing?

In fact, this is not surprising. In terms of defaming the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat, Khrushchev and his successors are the most outstanding "heroes." In your farce of anti-Soviet, anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary activities, Pasternak is just a small supporting actor. Now, the big traitor loves the small traitor, and the big scoundrel praises the small scoundrel. This is only natural.

It is clear that the Soviet revisionist leadership's open attempt to restore the reputation of this traitor, who is despised by the Soviet people, is driven by the urgent needs of counter-revolution. You, in order to maintain the rule of revisionism, have to bring out such blatantly and maliciously attacking socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat as "Doctor Zhivago" to poison and corrupt the Soviet people. You have already restored capitalism so thoroughly that now you feel you don't even need a thin veil of decency.

The Soviet revisionist clique once hypocritically criticized Pasternak, saying that he could leave the Soviet Union to "experience all the 'wonders' of the 'capitalist paradise.'" This traitor is already dead, but if he were alive today, wouldn't he be able to experience these "wonders" without leaving the Soviet Union?

    叛徒的丑剧
    消息传来，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团要在苏联出版叛徒作家帕斯捷尔纳克的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》。这是苏修反革命面目的又一次赤裸裸的暴露。
    人们记得，当年这部恶毒地丑化社会主义制度、丑化无产阶级专政的小说出笼的时候，立即受到了帝国主义和各国反动派的尽情喝采。那时，苏修集团也不得不承认，它是一部“充满对社会主义憎恨的”、“反革命和毁谤的”作品，不得不承认作者是“叛徒”，是苏联人民的“败类”，是“革命的敌人”。而现在，你们却要把这样一株反社会主义、反革命的大毒草捧出来，广为传播，并且为这个叛徒、败类和革命的敌人立碑作传。这不是最清楚不过地表明你们这一小撮都是些什么样的家伙，你们是在干着什么样的勾当么？
    其实，这并不奇怪。在丑化社会主义制度、丑化无产阶级专政这方面，赫鲁晓夫和你们这一伙继承人是最出色的“英雄”。在你们的反苏、反共、反人民、反革命的丑剧中，帕斯捷尔纳克只不过是一个小小的配角。现在，大叛徒钟爱小叛徒，大败类表彰小败类，这是理所当然的。
    很显然，苏修领导集团公然要给这个为苏联人民唾弃的叛徒恢复名誉，是出于反革命的迫切需要。你们为了维持修正主义的统治，所以要拿出象《日瓦戈医生》这种最露骨、最恶毒地攻击社会主义和无产阶级专政的黑货来，妄图毒害和腐蚀苏联人民。你们复辟资本主义已经做得如此彻底，因此现在觉得连薄薄的一层遮羞布也可以不要了。
    苏修集团当年曾经假惺惺地指责帕斯捷尔纳克，说什么他可以离开苏联，去“亲身尝受一切‘资本主义天堂的妙处’。”这个叛徒已经死了，要是他今天还活着，那末，他岂不是用不着离开苏联，也就可以尝到了这种“妙处”了吗？
