The film "The Last Emperor" was produced in the fall of 1948 and premiered in Hong Kong in November of the same year. As soon as it was released, it received praise from certain individuals. At that time, some newspapers and magazines also showed great interest in it. Why did a historical film cause such a big reaction? It brought the history of half a century ago, which had been distorted, to the screen. Whose political needs did it cater to?

One

In 1948, under the brilliant leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation War achieved brilliant victories. Even the American imperialists had to admit: "Under the current circumstances, unless the Kuomintang government implements reforms, it will gradually disintegrate through a slow process." Therefore, the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries tried every means to incite certain "democratic individualists" who had connections with both the Chinese reactionaries and American aggressors and the revolutionary camp to form an opposition within the revolutionary camp. They sought to make the revolution more moderate and ensure that it did not infringe too much on the interests of imperialism and its lackeys.

This new policy of American imperialism towards China was admitted in a white paper titled "Sino-American Relations" published by the U.S. Department of State. In this long and stinking white paper and its appendices, there are many confessions about this aspect. Among them, Appendix 159 is an editorial from the mouthpiece of the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek government, the fake "Central Daily News," titled "Quickly Settle Public Opinion," published on November 4, 1948, just one week before the traitorous film "The Last Emperor" was released. The editorial, mimicking the new tone of American imperialism, talked about how to "suppress the Communist rebellion" and more importantly, how to "start political reforms from military force." It frantically shouted, "We must learn from Bismarck's method of dealing with the German Communists, taking the issue from the Communists' hands" and so on. The editorial ended with a desperate cry, "Quickly settle public opinion, this is the only chance left."

In March 1948, Stuart said, "It is impossible to defeat the Communists militarily, and to prevent the Communists from ruling all of China, we must find other solutions." The fake "Central Daily News" followed, shouting, "Quickly settle public opinion, take the issue from the Communists' hands." Thus, the film "The Last Emperor" responded, "He who gains the hearts of the people gains the world, he who loses the hearts of the people loses the world."

In June 1948, imperialist elements admitted that they were working on "some reforms necessary to maintain public opinion and inspire people to resist the expansion of Communism and find the necessary leadership." The reactionary playwright Yao Ke depicted in "The Last Emperor" the efforts of Guangxu and Cixi to "maintain public opinion" by learning Western civilization and implementing some "reforms."

Is this a coincidence? No, by studying the domestic political situation at the time and the various public opinions created by American imperialism for the purpose of invading China, one can see that the film "The Last Emperor" was a replica of American public opinion at the time. American imperialism felt that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries "lacked the ability to stop the spread of Communism" and urgently sought a "desperately needed" "leader" as their ideal agent in China. The film "The Last Emperor," adapting to this political need, fabricated and depicted Guangxu and Cixi as imperialist agents.

Two

To adapt to the needs of American imperialism's aggression, the film "The Last Emperor" on the one hand, through Guangxu and Cixi, extensively promoted traitorism; on the other hand, it tried to cover up its ugliness by portraying Guangxu and Cixi as "patriotic heroes." It was truly a laborious effort to "be a prostitute and want to set up a signboard."

The film arranged many scenes where Guangxu and Cixi together talked about "reforming politics" and "enriching the country and strengthening the people." To "make the country better," Cixi passionately confronted Cixi and even burned incense at midnight to pray to heaven, hoping that the people would be "well-fed and happy." The playwright Yao Ke even had Guangxu sigh, "I don't care about my body, as long as the country has a way out," supposedly expressing his "patriotism."

Chairman Mao said: "The specific content of patriotism is determined by the historical conditions under which it is implemented. There is the patriotism of Japanese invaders and Hitler, and there is our patriotism. Communists must firmly oppose the so-called 'patriotism' of Japanese invaders and Hitler." The patriotism of different classes of people is completely different. Guangxu and Cixi loved a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country. For the revolutionary people, this "patriotism" is precisely treason.

The Guangxu and Cixi in the film protected the feudal exploitation system supported by imperialism. To maintain this shaky "Great Qing Dynasty," they tried to use the method of reform and innovation to follow Japan's "Meiji Restoration" path to "prosperity." They enthusiastically yearned for Western bourgeois civilization, as the representative of the reform and innovation at the time, Kang Youwei said, to select "excellent" children to study abroad and research science, to "strengthen military power, train new soldiers, and investigate the reasons for the prosperity of various countries in the East and West, using the strengths of others to make up for our own weaknesses."

In a letter to British Foreign Secretary Lansdowne on November 14, 1900, Kang Youwei said more clearly: "I hope that the restoration of Emperor Guangxu will be possible, and in such a case, the entire empire will be overjoyed. The Imperial Party is composed of the most enlightened and progressive people in the country, who are friendly to foreigners and also hope to combine Western civilization with their ancient country's culture."

The reformers' reform was essentially a path of flattering and befriending imperialism. They wanted to rely on British "assistance" to overthrow Cixi, then establish a parliament in Shanghai, open a new government, "announce to the world, protect Westerners, churches, etc., and as soon as the righteous army rises, sign treaties with various countries for trade, and restore the rule of reform." In their view, only by relying on imperialism could they control China and make China reform. Guangxu and Cixi in the film were typical representatives of those who were eager to follow this path.

Guangxu said, "Everything in China is backward, nothing can catch up with foreign countries," showing a typical slave mentality. Cixi, when the imperialist invaders were about to enter Beijing, joyfully told Guangxu, "This is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," and encouraged him to quickly "clean up the mess" and maintain the "Great Qing Dynasty." Why, when the imperialist claws were about to reach Beijing, did Cixi treat it as a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" and want to use this opportunity to "clean up the mess"? Isn't this clearly saying that as long as Guangxu recognizes the enemy as a father and betrays the country, he can consolidate the "Great Qing Dynasty"? Cixi's long-cherished "saving China" was precisely betraying China. The so-called "opportunity" was the opportunity to be a slave and a lackey; the so-called "cleaning up the mess" was to hand over China's vast territory to the imperialist invaders. Therefore, an American writer also sighed for the failure of Guangxu's Hundred Days' Reform, saying, "A precious opportunity that comes once in a thousand years has been missed." Look, isn't this the same as Cixi's words in the film? One is the opportunity to betray the country, and the other is the opportunity to invade; they sing in harmony, how well they match!

The reform and innovation movement failed, but the imperialists' attempt to find agents in China did not give up. By the 1940s, when imperialist forces were completely collapsing in China, their lackey Yao Ke, following the master's will, indeed brought the ghosts of Guangxu and Cixi, the imperialist spokesmen, to the screen, summoning new agents.

The ghosts of Guangxu and Cixi were revived in the number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party, who was the new bourgeois agent that American imperialism was looking for in China. He was not "standing up" but, like Guangxu and Cixi, extensively promoted American civilization: saying things like "China's domestic peace and international peace in the Far East, you (American imperialism) and we are equally in need of it," "In America, even if he is an engineer, earning more money and having greater skills, he does not think he is superior to a worker," "American President Washington and Lincoln retired to become ordinary citizens, the American bourgeoisie can still talk about democracy like this!" and so on. The number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party longed for and yearned for the so-called "democracy" of the American bourgeoisie and the bourgeois republic! This number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party was not just like Guangxu and Cixi?

Three

Starting from the counter-revolutionary political needs, the film "The Last Emperor" depicted Guangxu as a "good emperor" who dared to fight against the tyrannical Empress Dowager Cixi for the sake of "enriching the country and strengthening the people"; it embellished the struggle between Guangxu and Cixi as a struggle between "patriotism" and "misguidedness." However, no matter how the film distorted right and wrong, the historical truth cannot be covered up. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The large landlord class and the large comprador class have always stood on the side of imperialism and are extremely counter-revolutionary." As the representative of the feudal landlord class, whether it was Guangxu or Cixi, they were all extremely counter-revolutionary, which is undeniable.

Before the Hundred Days' Reform, due to the increasing aggression of imperialism against China, the people's struggle against imperialism and its lackeys was surging, making the Qing rulers feel the fear of impending collapse. Various so-called "national salvation" prescriptions emerged. Which prescription could save the day, and the ruling class fought over this within itself.

Cixi installed the young Guangxu as the emperor, and she herself controlled the court power, always "looking down on the emperor as if he were nothing, not even as important as Li Lianying." After Guangxu grew up, the contradictions between the two became sharp, which was natural. But this was not the "patriotism" versus "misguidedness" struggle as depicted in the film, but a struggle within the ruling class, a dog-eat-dog fight. Even Kang Youwei had once thought: "Their struggle seems to be mainly for power, and the purpose of what they are fighting for is not significantly different. And the high-ranking officials, whether they side with the Empress Dowager or Guangxu, all depend on their guesses about who will be in power, not because they think political reforms are necessary or they are determined to be conservative. In other words, the conflict between the Empress Dowager and Guangxu did not involve differences in political views." Kang Youwei's words exposed the essence of the "struggle" between Cixi and Guangxu at that time.

Chairman Mao taught us: "American imperialists, Chinese reactionaries, and their friends, although they cannot be firmly united, although they will have endless quarrels, mutual cursing, mutual complaints, mutual abandonment, but in one aspect they will cooperate with each other, that is, using various methods to try to destroy revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces." The contradiction between Guangxu and Cixi was also like this. Although Guangxu once attempted to use Yuan Shikai to kill Rong Lu and eliminate the reactionary party, Cixi even imprisoned Guangxu and forced Cixi to death, they were united in trying to destroy revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces. The focus of the argument was on what methods to use to maintain and consolidate their power. The two counter-revolutionary factions competed, one side said their method was the best, and the other side said their method was the best, this was the essence of the two sides arguing fiercely until they finally had to show their cards. In the eyes of the faction led by Guangxu, relying solely on military force was not enough to eliminate the people's revolution, they attempted to implement reforms to "stop, weaken, or suppress revolutionary struggles, disperse the energy of the revolutionary class, and blur their awareness" (Lenin's words), under the protection of imperialism, to maintain their shaky power. The faction led by Cixi advocated using the contradictions between the people and imperialism, using imperialist military force to suppress the Boxers, and then consolidating their rule with the support of imperialism. After issuing the "declaration of war," Cixi soon sent a telegram to the ministers stationed in various countries, completely exposing her false war and collusion. She instructed the ministers stationed in various countries to explain to the governments of the countries they were stationed in: "At this time, the 'rebels' in the two provinces of Zhili and Shandong have merged into one, and it is impossible to separate them. The court does not want to issue an order to 'suppress' these 'rebels,' but the elbows are too tight, deeply fearing that the embassies will not be protected, causing a big disaster, and also fearing that the provinces of Zhili and the East will simultaneously rise up, ... China is not self-righteous, but how can it simultaneously provoke various countries, and how can it rely on 'rebels' to provoke various countries, this intention should be deeply understood by various countries. ... Now, the generals are still strictly ordered to protect the embassies as before, and to deal with these 'rebels' according to the situation." Isn't this clear? Declaring war is false, suppressing the Boxers is true. No matter how Cixi and Guangxu argued, colluding with imperialism, suppressing the Boxers, and preserving their reactionary rule were exactly the same.

The aggression of imperialism and the surrender of the Qing government aroused strong resistance from the Chinese people. The great anti-imperialist and anti-feudal Boxer Movement showed the Chinese people's unyielding spirit of resistance against imperialism and its lackeys, and showed the heroic spirit of the Chinese people fighting to the end with their enemies. The glorious achievements of the Boxer Movement are immortal and cannot be erased by any reactionary literati.

The film "The Last Emperor," standing on the side of imperialism and its lackeys, with deep hatred for the Chinese people, maliciously slandered and vilified the Boxer Movement. The film tried to cover up the aggressive nature of imperialism, distorting the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance into Beijing as a result of the Boxers "provoking public anger" and "various countries being outraged." It was a traitorous face, the logic of a lackey, and the tone of imperialism, shameless to the extreme! Towards the Boxers, the film did its utmost to slander and vilify them, depicting the revolutionary heroes as a group of demons who killed and set fires everywhere, using dark and terrifying scenes, accompanied by hysterical noises, making them chant nonsensical incantations, wearing inhuman and monstrous costumes, and rolling on the ground. This was truly a distortion of right and wrong, a confusion of black and white, with evil intentions and extremely reactionary!

However, such a reactionary film that beautified imperialism and its lackeys and vilified the Chinese people's revolution was highly praised by the number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party. Was this a coincidence? Absolutely not.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In any class society, any class always puts political standards first and artistic standards second." The number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party was precisely preparing for a capitalist restoration and resonated strongly with this reactionary film. Wasn't it he who strongly advocated learning from those who had "opened foreign companies" and "been compradors" "experts"? Wasn't it he who advocated that "before liberation, the foreign companies in Shanghai, if you wanted something from Singapore, you just had to make a phone call and it would be delivered"? Wasn't it he who boasted about "American democratic spirit" everywhere? The number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party not only enthusiastically praised imperialism and its lackeys but also maliciously slandered the working class and vilified the working class. He said, "Workers are not against exploitation, but they are afraid of no one to exploit." "Now, people are not afraid of you exploiting them, but they are afraid of you not exploiting them, they want you to exploit more, not less." Look, the number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party was so close to imperialism and its lackeys and so hateful towards the revolutionary people! What kind of "old revolutionary" was he? He was an outright counter-revolutionary! An imperialist lackey!

Lenin said: "The theoretical victory of Marxism forced its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists, such is the dialectic of history." The number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party was such a two-faced counter-revolutionary who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, a number one careerist who infiltrated the Party. We must raise the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to smash this number one capitalist-road power-holder within the Party to the ground, making him never stand up again. We must defend the iron fortress of the proletariat with our lives, making it never change color!

    影片《清宫秘史》的反动本质
    史红兵
    《清宫秘史》摄制于一九四八年秋，同年十一月在香港公演。这部影片一放映，立刻得到了一些人的吹捧。当时一些报刊，也对它发生了浓厚的兴趣。一部历史题材的影片，为什么会引起这么大的反应呢？它把半世纪前那段被歪曲了的历史搬上银幕，又是投合了谁的政治需要呢？
                              一
    一九四八年，中国人民解放战争在伟大的中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，取得了辉煌的胜利。美帝国主义也不得不供认：“在目前情况下，除非国民党政府厉行改革，它将经缓慢逐渐的过程而告瓦解”。因此，美蒋反动派千方百计地想策动某些既同中国反动派和美国侵略者有联系，又同革命阵营有联系的所谓“民主个人主义者”，构成革命阵营中的反对派，力求使革命带上温和色彩，务必不要太多地侵犯帝国主义及其走狗的利益。
    美帝国主义的这种对华新政策，是美国国务院发表的一本名为《中美关系》的白皮书中所供认的。在这本又臭又长的白皮书及其附件中，有不少关于这一方面的自供状。其中附件一五九，是蒋介石卖国政府的喉舌伪《中央日报》的一篇社论，题为《赶快收拾人心》，发表于一九四八年十一月四日，也就是卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》出笼前一个星期。这篇社论学着美帝国主义的新腔调，大谈什么“欲求戡平共党祸乱”，更重要的则是“由军事力量所从出的政治改革着手”，疯狂地叫嚷：“我们必须效法俾斯麦对付德国共党的办法，把题目从共党手中夺过来”等等。社论结尾在绝望中无可奈何地呼喊：“赶快收拾人心，只有这一个机会了。”
    一九四八年三月，司徒雷登说，“在军事上战胜共产党是不可能的，而且如果要避免共产党统治全中国的话，便须要找到其他解决的办法”。伪《中央日报》跟着叫嚷：“赶快收拾人心”，“把题目从共党手中夺过来”。于是，影片《清宫秘史》也就应声说：“得人心者得天下，失人心者失天下”。
    一九四八年六月，帝国主义分子供认他们努力于“从事为维系人心和鼓舞人们抵抗共产党扩张所必要的一些改革并找到所必要的领导”。反动剧作者姚克就在《清宫秘史》中描绘了为“维系人心”而学习西方文明进行一些“改革”的光绪和珍妃。
    这是巧合吗？不，只要研究一下当时国内的政治形势以及美帝国主义为侵略中国的需要而制造的种种舆论，就可以看出影片《清宫秘史》是当时美国舆论的翻版。美帝国主义感到蒋介石反动派“缺乏阻止共产主义蔓延的能力”，急于寻找“一个迫切需要的”“领导人物”，作为它在中国称心如意的代理人。影片《清宫秘史》适应这种政治需要，就编造和描写了光绪、珍妃这样的帝国主义代理人。
                            二
    影片《清宫秘史》为了适应美帝国主义的侵略需要，一方面通过光绪和珍妃，大肆宣扬卖国主义；一方面又想遮丑，把光绪和珍妃吹捧成“爱国英雄”的形象。“既要做婊子，又想树牌坊”，真是煞费苦心。
    影片安排了许多场面，让光绪和珍妃在一起，大谈什么“改良政治”、“富国强民”。为了“把国家弄好”，珍妃慷慨激昂地与慈禧进行面对面的斗争，而且还半夜焚香对天祷告，希望天下人能够“丰衣足食乐陶陶”。剧作者姚克甚至还让光绪发出了“身体我倒不在乎，只要国家有办法”的所谓“爱国”感叹。
    毛主席说：“爱国主义的具体内容，看在什么样的历史条件之下来决定。有日本侵略者和希特勒的‘爱国主义’，有我们的爱国主义。对于日本侵略者和希特勒的所谓‘爱国主义’，共产党员是必须坚决地反对的”。不同阶级的人，他们的爱国主义是完全不同的。光绪和珍妃爱的是半封建半殖民地之国。对于革命人民来说，这种“爱国”恰恰是卖国。
    影片中的光绪和珍妃保护的是帝国主义支持下的封建剥削制度。为了保住这摇摇欲坠的“大清天下”，他们想通过变法维新的方法，走日本“明治维新”的“强盛之路”。他们狂热地向往西方资产阶级文明，正如当时变法维新的代表人物康有为所说的，要选派“优秀”子弟出洋研究科学，要“修武备、练新兵，再考查东西各国所以富强之道，用他人之长，补自己之短”。
    一九○○年十一月十四日，康有为给英国外交大臣兰斯顿的一封信中，说得更清楚：“我希望，使光绪陛下复位，会成为可能的事，在那种场合，整个帝国将为之欢欣鼓舞。帝党是由国内最开明和最进步的人们组成的，这些人对外国人是友好的，并且也希望把西方文明同他们的古老国家的文化结合起来。”
    维新派的改良，实质上走的是一条把希望寄托在帝国主义的身上的媚帝、亲帝的道路。他们想依靠英国“相助”，推倒慈禧，然后在上海立国会，开新政府，“迎上南迁，先布告各国，保护西人洋行、教会等事，义军一起，即与各国订约通商，复我维新之治”。在他们看来，也只有依靠帝国主义才可能控制中国，使中国维新。影片中的光绪和珍妃，就是热中于走这条道路的典型代表。
    光绪说，中国“一切落后，什么事都赶不上外国”，表现出十足的奴才思想。珍妃在帝国主义侵略者将要侵入北京的时候，却喜出望外地对光绪说：“这是您千载一时的好机会”，并鼓励他赶快来“收拾残局”，保住“大清朝的天下”。为什么帝国主义的魔掌就要伸进北京了，珍妃却象来了救命恩人似的，把它看做“千载一时的好机会”，并要借此机会“收拾残局”？这不是明明地说，只要光绪认贼作父，卖国投靠，就可以巩固“大清朝的天下”。珍妃梦寐以求的所谓“救中国”，就是卖中国。所谓“好机会”，就是做奴才、当走狗的机会；所谓“收拾残局”，就是把中国的大好河山拱手送给帝国主义侵略者。所以有一个美国作家也为光绪戊戌变法的失败而叹息说：“一个千载难逢的珍贵机会被丢掉了。”看，这与影片中珍妃的话不是同出一辙吗？一个是卖国的“机会”，一个是侵略的“机会”，一唱一和，多么合拍。
    维新变法运动失败了，但是帝国主义者在中国寻找代理人的企图并没有死心。到了二十世纪的四十年代，正当帝国主义势力在中国彻底崩溃的时候，它的奴才姚克顺从主子的意旨，果然把这个帝国主义代言人的光绪、珍妃的亡灵搬上了银幕，以召唤着新的代理人。
    光绪、珍妃的亡灵，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派身上复活了，他就是美帝国主义在中国所要寻找的新的资产阶级代理人。他不是“挺身而出”，也象光绪、珍妃那样大肆宣扬美国文明：说什么“中国的国内和平与远东的国际和平，你们（美帝国主义）与我们是同样需要的”呀，什么“在美国，即使他是工程师，赚钱多，本领大一些，但并不以为比工人高一等”呀，什么“美国大总统华盛顿、林肯退职时，就退为平民，美国的资产阶级还能够这样讲民主……”呀！如此等等。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派对美国资产阶级的所谓“民主”、对资产阶级共和国是多么怀念，多么向往！这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，不是正和光绪、珍妃之流一样吗？
                           三
    影片《清宫秘史》从反革命的政治需要出发，把光绪描写成一个为了“富国强民”，敢于和专横的西太后作了斗争的“好皇帝”；把光绪与慈禧的斗争粉饰成“爱国”与“误国”之争。可是，不管这部影片怎样颠倒黑白，历史的真相是掩盖不了的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席早就指出：“大地主阶级和大买办阶级，他们始终站在帝国主义一边，是极端的反革命派。”作为封建地主阶级的总代表，无论是光绪还是慈禧，他们都是极端的反革命派，这是毫无疑问的。
    戊戌变法前，由于帝国主义对中国的侵略日益加剧，中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的斗争风起云涌，使清朝统治者预感到行将崩溃的恐惧。各种所谓“救国”丹方，应运而生。到底那一种丹方能够救命，统治阶级内部为此展开了派别斗争。
    慈禧立年幼的光绪为帝，她自己掌握朝廷大权，一直“视帝蔑如，尚不及视李莲英之重也。”光绪成年以后，双方的矛盾便呈现尖锐状态，这是自然的。但这绝不是影片所渲染的“爱国”与“误国”的矛盾，而是统治阶级内部的矛盾，是一种狗咬狗的斗争。这一点，连康有为都曾经认为：“他们之间的争斗，似乎主要的是为争政权，至于所争的是何种政权，彼此的目的并无显著的区别。而一般高级官吏，不论是倒向西太后这边，或是倒向光绪那边，全凭他们猜测谁可得势，并非由于他们认为政治需要改革，或者他们决心守旧。换言之，西太后与光绪之间的冲突，并未涉及政见的不同。”康有为的话，说穿了当时慈禧与光绪之间“斗争”的实质。
    毛主席教导我们：“美国帝国主义者、中国反动派和他们的朋友，虽然不能够巩固地团结一致，虽然会发生无穷的互相争吵，互相恶骂，互相埋怨，互相抛弃，但是在有一点上却会互相合作，这就是用各种方法力图破坏革命势力而保存反动势力。”光绪和慈禧之间的矛盾也正是这样。尽管光绪曾企图起用袁世凯杀荣禄、除逆党，慈禧甚至幽禁了光绪，逼死了珍妃，但是他们之间在力图破坏革命势力而保存反动势力这一点上是一致的。争论的焦点，是采用什么办法维持和巩固自己的政权。两派反革命竞赛，一派说我们的法子最好，另一派说我们的法子最好，这就是两派争论得不可开交以至最后不得不摊牌的实质。在光绪为首的一派看来，光靠军事力量是不足以消灭人民革命的，他们妄图实行改良，以“阻止、削弱或扑灭革命斗争，分散革命阶级的精力，模糊他们的认识”（列宁语），在帝国主义的卵翼下，保持其摇摇欲坠的政权。以慈禧为首的一派则主张利用人民大众与帝国主义之间的矛盾，假手帝国主义武力扑灭义和团，然后在帝国主义支持下以巩固自己的统治。慈禧在发出“宣战谕旨”之后不久，便给出使各国的大臣拍发了一封电报，完全暴露了她的假宣战真勾结的面目。她指示出使各国大臣向各驻在国政府解释：“此时直东西两省之‘乱党’，已熔成一片，不可开交矣。朝廷非不欲将此种‘乱民’下令痛‘剿’，而肘腋之间，操之太蹙，深恐各使馆保护不及，激成大祸，亦恐直东各省同时举事，……中国即不自量，亦何至与各国同时开衅，并何至恃‘乱民’与各国开衅，此意当为各国所深谅。……现仍严饬带兵官，照前保护使馆，惟力是视；此种‘乱民’，设法相机，自行惩办”。这不是很清楚吗？对外宣战是假，消灭义和团是真。不管慈禧和光绪如何争吵，勾结帝国主义，消灭义和团，保存自己的反动统治，则是完全相同的。
    帝国主义的侵略，清政府的屈膝投降，激起了中国人民的强烈反抗。伟大的反帝反封建的义和团运动，表现了中国人民不甘屈服于帝国主义及其走狗的顽强的反抗精神，表现了中国人民有同自己的敌人血战到底的英雄气概。义和团运动的光辉业绩，是永垂不朽的，也不是任何反动文人所能抹煞得了的。
    影片《清宫秘史》，站在帝国主义及其走狗的立场上，怀着对中国人民刻骨仇恨，对义和团运动进行了恶毒的诬蔑和丑化。影片极力掩盖帝国主义侵略本性，把八国联军的侵略歪曲成由于义和团“犯了众怒”，“各国动了公愤”，才打进天津，打进北京。一副卖国主义的嘴脸，走狗的逻辑，帝国主义的腔调，无耻到了极点！对义和团，影片则极尽其诬蔑丑化之能事，把革命的英雄们诬蔑成为一群到处杀人放火的魔鬼，用阴森恐怖的画面，配上歇斯底里的噪音，让他们念着不伦不类的咒语，穿着非人非妖的服装，躺在地上打滚。这真是颠倒是非，混淆黑白，用心恶毒，反动之极！
    但是，这样一部美化帝国主义及其走狗、丑化中国人民革命的反动影片，却受到党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的百般吹捧。这是偶然的吗？绝对不是。
    毛主席指出：“任何阶级社会中的任何阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，正是为了准备进行资本主义复辟而与这部反动影片发生了强烈的共鸣。不正是他，极力主张向那些“开过洋行的、当过买办”的“专家”去学习吗？不正是他，宣扬“解放前，上海的大洋行，要新加坡的东西，打个电话就送来”吗？不正是他，到处吹嘘“美国民主精神”吗？党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，不仅狂热地吹捧帝国主义及其走狗，而且极其恶毒地诬蔑工人阶级，丑化工人阶级。他胡说“工人不是不赞成剥削，而是怕无人剥削”。“现在人民不是怕你剥削而是怕你不剥削，他叫你剥削多一点而不是叫你剥削少一点。”请看，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对帝国主义及其走狗是那样的亲，对革命人民是这样的恨！他是什么“老革命”？不折不扣的反革命！帝国主义的奴才！
    列宁说：“马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人装扮成马克思主义者，历史的辩证法就是如此。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这样一个打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命两面派，是混进党内的头号野心家。我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派打倒在地，使他永世不得翻身。我们要誓死保卫无产阶级铁打的江山，使它永不变色！
