The head of the "security" organization, Shemichasny, suddenly steps down, and Lukoshin dies mysteriously. The Soviet military newspaper publishes an article by Koniev detailing the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion.

New China News Agency, May 29th: Moscow News: The Soviet revisionist leadership's important tool for implementing fascist dictatorship domestically, the Soviet Union's Committee for State Security, has recently undergone personnel changes.

According to a report by the Soviet Union's *Pravda* on the 19th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued an order appointing the Soviet revisionist Central Committee Secretary Yu. Andropov as the Chairman of the Committee for State Security, while simultaneously removing V. Shemichasny from his position as Chairman of the Committee for State Security.

According to various reports, Andropov is one of the figures who quickly rose to power after Khrushchev usurped the party and state power in the Soviet Union. Since 1957, he has served as the head of a department in the Central Committee of the CPSU. In 1962, he was promoted to the position of Secretary of the Central Committee. In recent years, he has frequently acted as an important entourage member of the Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev and others on overseas visits, or as a member of the CPSU delegation participating in a series of international conspiratorial activities.

Shemichasny, who was removed from his position, took over the position of Chairman of the Committee for State Security in 1961 after Shelepin. During Shelepin's tenure as the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol, he served as a Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Komsomol. Currently, Shelepin is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Soviet revisionists.

At the same time as the change in the Chairman of the Soviet Union's Committee for State Security, the *Red Star* newspaper published an obituary on the 19th, announcing the death of "Major General Lukoshin, a leading figure in the Committee for State Security" while "performing his duties." Lukoshin has been in charge of military security in the Soviet Union's Committee for State Security since 1954. The *Red Star* newspaper did not publish a photograph of this deceased general when it published the obituary, and the obituary was issued by "a group of comrades" without a specific signature, which is a very unusual phenomenon.

Coincidentally, May 19th is the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Pioneer Organization, and this year also marks the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. On such occasions, the Soviet revisionists usually hold grand celebrations. People have noticed that during the 44th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Pioneer Organization last year, important leaders of the Soviet revisionist leadership such as Kosygin, Podgorny, Suslov, and Shelepin attended the celebration. However, this year's grand celebration was unusually quiet. Although a review ceremony was held on Red Square, no Soviet revisionist leaders attended, and not even the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol appeared.

People have noticed that on the same day these thought-provoking events occurred, i.e., May 19th, Moscow also experienced some unusual situations. That morning, more than twenty trucks full of soldiers drove past Red Square, and the traffic control in the center of Moscow was chaotic all day. In the afternoon, a cavalry in firefighter uniforms appeared.

The next day (May 20th), the Soviet military newspaper *Red Star* published an article by Soviet Marshal Koniev titled "The Fighting Glory of the Soviet People" in the lead editorial position, detailing the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion during the 10th Congress of the CPSU in 1921.

The Soviet revisionist leadership's domestic and international misdeeds have met with strong opposition from the Soviet people and revolutionary people around the world, making their days increasingly difficult. The rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership is extremely unstable, with internal contradictions, mutual infighting, and intense power struggles. The occurrence of the above series of unusual events is thought-provoking.

    苏修人事变动暴露内讧加剧统治不稳
    “保安”机构的头目谢米恰斯内伊突然下台，鲁科申死得离奇
    苏军报纸发表科涅夫文章竟大讲当年镇压喀琅施塔得暴乱经过
    新华社二十九日讯  莫斯科消息：苏修领导集团在国内实行法西斯专政的重要工具——苏联国家安全委员会，最近突然发生了人事变动。
    据苏联《真理报》十九日报道：苏联最高苏维埃主席团发布命令，任命苏修中央书记尤·安德罗波夫为国家安全委员会主席，并同时解除弗·谢米恰斯内伊原任国家安全委员会主席的职务。
    据各方面消息报道，安德罗波夫是赫鲁晓夫篡夺苏联党政大权后往上爬得很快的人物之一。从一九五七年起，他当上了苏共中央一个部的部长，一九六二年被提为苏共中央书记。几年来，他经常作为苏修头目勃列日涅夫等的重要随行人员出访，或以苏共代表团成员的身份参加一系列的国际阴谋活动。
    被解除职务的谢米恰斯内伊是一九六一年继谢列平之后担任国家安全委员会主席职务的，在谢列平担任苏联共青团中央第一书记期间，他当过共青团中央书记处书记。现在，谢列平是苏修中央政治局委员。
    就在苏联国家安全委员会主席易人的同时，十九日的《红星报》刊登了一条讣告，宣布“国家安全委员会领导工作者鲁科申少将”在所谓“执行公务时惨遭不幸身死”。鲁科申自一九五四年起一直在苏联国家安全委员会担任负责军队安全的领导职务。《红星报》在刊登这一讣告的时候，没有同时刊登这位有将军衔的死者的照片，而且，发出讣告的只是“一群同志”，而没有具体署名，这是很反常的现象。
    无独有偶的是，十九日是苏联少先队成立四十五周年纪念日，又赶上今年是十月革命五十周年，象这样的节日，苏修通常是要大庆一番的。人们注意到，在去年苏联少先队成立四十四周年的时候，苏修领导集团的重要头目柯西金、波德戈尔内、苏斯洛夫、谢列平等曾出席了庆祝仪式。而今年的大庆却一反常态，冷冷清清。虽然在红场上也举行了检阅仪式，但没有一个苏修头目到场，连苏联共青团中央第一书记也没有露面。
    人们注意到，就在发生这一系列引人深思的事件的同一天，即五月十九日，莫斯科还出现了某些非常情况。这一天清晨，二十几辆满载军人的大卡车驶过红场，全天莫斯科市中心交通指挥混乱，下午有身着消防队制服的马队出现。
    第二天（五月二十日），苏军报纸《红星报》在头版社论地位刊登苏联元帅科涅夫写的题为《苏联人民的战斗光荣》的文章，大谈一九二一年苏共第十次代表大会期间镇压喀琅施塔得暴乱的经过。
    苏修领导集团在国内外倒行逆施，遭到苏联人民和全世界革命人民的强烈反对，他们的日子越来越不好混了。苏修领导集团的统治极不稳定，内部矛盾重重，互相倾轧，争权夺利的斗争日益尖锐化和表面化。上述一系列异乎寻常的事情的发生，是耐人寻味的。
