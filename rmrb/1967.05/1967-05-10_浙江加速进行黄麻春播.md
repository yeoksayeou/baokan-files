The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton and hemp producing areas of Zhejiang Province have displayed the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day" and, after completing the spring planting of cotton, are now speeding up the spring planting of hemp.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the cotton and hemp producing areas of Zhejiang Province have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, and established the idea of growing cotton and hemp well for the revolution. Under the great call of Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," the preparation for spring planting in the cotton and hemp producing areas this year has been done relatively well. At present, the spring planting of more than 1.2 million mu of cotton fields in the entire province has been completed ahead of schedule and in accordance with quality and quantity standards. The sowing of hemp has begun universally.
