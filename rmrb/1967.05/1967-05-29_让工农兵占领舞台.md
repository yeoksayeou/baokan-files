Title: Let Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Take the Stage

Mao Zedong's two directives on literature and art have been published. These are the guiding lights of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, illuminating the path for our cultural warriors and inspiring their revolutionary will. They greatly boost the morale of the revolutionary faction of the proletariat and crush the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party and his clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists have used their usurped power to promote a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the arts, allowing emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties to dominate our socialist stage. During the three years of temporary difficulties, our Shandong Provincial Peking Opera Troupe, under the control of a clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, staged plays like "Beneath the Red Flag," which incited the return of ghosts and snakes, and "The Concubine of Han," which praised treachery and surrender. The poisonous play "Sun An's Rebellion" was also performed in Jinan, echoing Beijing's "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," and stirred up wave after wave of anti-Party black tides.

After Mao Zedong's two directives were conveyed, the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists still stubbornly resisted, using the pretext of "walking on two legs" to alternate between traditional plays featuring emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties, and revolutionary modern plays. In reality, they allowed traditional plays to spread poison while preventing revolutionary modern plays from taking root. Once, when we performed in Qingdao to entertain the PLA, the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists staged "The Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" and "Meeting in the Mulberry Garden," but refused to perform "The Red Detachment of Women," which directly reflects the army's combat life. Only under immense public pressure did they reluctantly perform it for three shows.

Before the national performance of modern Peking Opera in 1964, all revolutionary comrades in our troupe proposed the slogan of "Fighting the White Tiger Team," but the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists maliciously diverted the main performers and staff of "The Red Detachment of Women" to meticulously create the feudal poisonous play "Wang Baozheng."

Incident after incident, these are the heinous crimes of the top capitalist-roader in the Party and the clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and they are ironclad evidence of their propaganda for restoring capitalism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has exposed the enemy's plots and opened our eyes. Our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing, following Chairman Mao's two directives, has vigorously fostered the eight model operas that shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, repelling the enemy's repeated savage attacks, and making emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties roll off the cultural stage, allowing the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers to stand proudly on the socialist cultural stage.

We are determined to further raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, to fiercely criticize and struggle against the top capitalist-roader in the Party and his clique, to eliminate their poison, to use the sharp weapon of the arts to unite the people, educate the people, strike the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, to defend our socialist iron-clad mountains and rivers for eternity, and to let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shine forever over all of China and the world!

    让工农兵占领舞台
    山东省京剧团革命委员会
    毛主席关于文学艺术的两个批示公开发表了。这是无产阶级文化大革命的指路明灯，它照亮了我们文艺战士的前进征途，它鼓舞了我们文艺战士的革命意志。它大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了资产阶级的威风。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他支持的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，利用他们窃取的职权，推行了一条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线，让帝王将相、才子佳人霸占着我们社会主义的文艺舞台。在三年暂时困难时期，我们山东省京剧团在一小撮反革命修正主义分子的把持下，也把鼓动牛鬼蛇神东山再起的《卧薪尝胆》和歌颂投降变节的《汉明妃》、《四郎探母》等搬上了舞台。柳子戏大毒草《孙安动本》也在济南演出，同北京的《海瑞罢官》遥相呼应，掀起了一阵又一阵的反党黑浪。
    毛主席的两个批示传达以后，一小撮反革命修正主义分子仍然顽固抗拒，打着“两条腿走路”的幌子，让帝王将相、才子佳人和革命的现代戏轮流上演。其实是只准传统戏放毒，不准革命现代戏扎根。有一次，我们在青岛慰问解放军，一小撮反革命修正主义分子大演《八仙过海》、《桑园会》等坏戏，却不愿上演直接反映部队战斗生活的《奇袭白虎团》。在群众强大压力下，才勉强演了三场。
    一九六四年京剧现代戏全国会演前夕，我团全体革命同志提出了大战“白虎团”的口号，可是一小撮反革命修正主义分子却别有用心地抽调了《奇袭白虎团》的主要演员、职员去精心炮制封建主义的大毒草《王宝钏》。
    一桩桩，一件件，都是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子的滔天罪恶，都是他们为复辟资本主义大造舆论的铁证。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席戳穿了阶级敌人的阴谋，给我们擦亮了眼睛。我们敬爱的江青同志，遵照毛主席的这两个批示，大力扶植了八个闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的样板戏，打退了阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂进攻，使帝王将相、才子佳人统统滚下了文艺舞台，让工农兵英雄形象昂然挺立在社会主义文艺舞台上。
    我们决心进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命的批判大旗，狠批猛斗党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，肃清他们的流毒，用文艺这一锐利武器团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人，保卫我们的社会主义铁打的江山千秋万代永不变色，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远普照全中国、全世界！
