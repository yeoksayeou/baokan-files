On the twenty-fifth anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," as we review the journey of our revolutionary propaganda team and recall Chairman Mao's teachings, we feel a deep sense of closeness.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Literature and art should become a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and destroying the enemy."

In mid-August last year, our revolutionary propaganda team was established. At that time, the Cultural Revolution was in full swing and gradually reaching its peak. Red revolutionaries took to the political stage, stormed out of the schools, and marched into society. Due to the needs of the class struggle in reality, we took up the weapon of literature and art, along with thousands of other revolutionary propaganda teams, charging into the Cultural Revolution's battle. We used literature and art to unite the people, educate the people, and launch a fierce attack on a small clique within the old Black Dragon River Provincial Committee who were taking the capitalist road.

Our revolutionary propaganda team had no special artistic talents, but we had the revolutionary spirit to fiercely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Therefore, as soon as we appeared, we were persecuted and suppressed by a small clique within the old Provincial Committee who were taking the capitalist road. The enemy was cunning, but we were even more so. We used our literary and artistic weapons to fight them head-on. They issued the "August 16 Notice," attempting to extinguish the flames of the Cultural Revolution, so we responded with a "Big-character Poster to the Provincial Committee," exposing their plots. They incited uninformed masses to attack us, so we performed a program called "Calling Out to Worker Comrades, I Have Something to Tell You," revealing the truth to the deceived masses and winning them over to stand with the revolutionary rebels.

During our struggle, "Rebellion is Justified" was sung, and the "Rebellion Dance" was performed. We created a strong public opinion that "Rebellion is Justified." In our difficult days, we looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and sang "Looking Up to See the Big Dipper," and performed "Endless Scenery on the Dangerous Peak." Our hearts soared to Beijing, and we resolved to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, using literature and art to unite and inspire the people, and to fight the enemy together.

We took to the streets, entered factories, and performed revolutionary programs that combined with actual struggles, singing self-composed songs like "Rebellion is Justified" and "Revolution is an Uprising." This greatly boosted the morale of the red revolutionaries and crushed the arrogance of those in power who were taking the capitalist road. After the performances, revolutionary masses rushed onto the stage, shaking our hands excitedly and saying, "Excellent! Excellent! You have fully expressed the spirit of our revolutionary rebels!"

In December last year, we went to the Chongqing area for joint activities. There, we not only fought side by side with the local revolutionary rebels but also took up our literary and artistic weapons to carry out propaganda activities. The comrades in Chongqing happily told us, "You are not just performing propaganda, you are fighting with us!"

In the practice of class struggle, we deeply felt how great Chairman Mao's teachings are! Our propaganda team still has a lot to do in this regard and is still far from meeting Chairman Mao's requirements. In the future, we will definitely study the "Talks" better, use the weapon of revolutionary literature and art, bravely defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and actively promote the great thought of Mao Zedong!

    革命文艺是文化大革命有力的战斗武器
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团造反宣传队
    在纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》二十五周年的时候，回顾我们造反宣传队走过的道路，重温毛主席的教导，我们觉得倍加亲切。
    毛主席教导我们：要使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。
    去年八月中旬，我们造反宣传队成立。那时，方兴未艾的文化大革命运动正逐步推向高潮。红色造反者登上了政治舞台，杀出了学校，杀向了社会。由于现实的阶级斗争需要，我们拿起了文艺这一武器，和千百支造反的宣传队一起，冲进文化大革命的战火中。我们用文艺团结人民，教育人民，向旧黑龙江省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开猛烈的进攻。
    我们造反宣传队没有什么艺术专长，可是我们有为捍卫毛主席的革命路线奋勇作战的革命精神。因此，我们一出现就遭到旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的迫害和压制。魔高一尺，道高一丈。我们用文艺武器同他们进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们来个“八·一六”通知，妄图扑灭文化大革命的烈火，我们就来一个《给省委一张大字报》，揭穿他们的阴谋；他们挑动不明真相的群众来围攻我们，我们就编一个《叫声工人老大哥，有件事情对你说》的节目，向受蒙蔽的群众说明真相，争取他们和革命造反派站在一起。
    在我们斗争的日子里，《造反有理》唱起来了，《造反舞》跳起来了，我们把“造反有理”的舆论造得足足的。在我们艰苦的日子里，我们望着毛主席他老人家的画像，唱起了《抬头望见北斗星》，跳起了《无限风光在险峰》，我们的心飞向了北京，我们决心遵照毛主席的教导，用文艺团结和激励人民，同心同德地和敌人去作斗争。
    我们走上街头，走进工厂，演出结合实际斗争的造反节目，高唱自己谱曲的语录歌《造反有理》、《革命是暴动》。大长了红色造反者的志气，大灭了走资本主义道路当权派的威风。演出结束后，革命群众冲上台去紧握住我们的双手，激动地说：“太好了！太好了！你们把我们造反派的劲头全表达出来了！”
    去年十二月份，我们到重庆地区去串连。在那里，我们一方面和当地的革命造反派战友们并肩作战，一方面拿起文艺武器展开宣传活动。重庆的战友们高兴地对我们说：“你们哪里是宣传演出，是在和我们一块战斗啊！”
    在阶级斗争的实践中，我们深切地体会到，毛主席的教导是多么伟大啊！我们这个宣传队，在这方面还作得很不够，离毛主席他老人家的要求还差得很远。今后我们一定要更好地学习《讲话》，用革命文艺的武器，勇敢地捍卫毛主席的革命路线，积极宣传伟大的毛泽东思想！
