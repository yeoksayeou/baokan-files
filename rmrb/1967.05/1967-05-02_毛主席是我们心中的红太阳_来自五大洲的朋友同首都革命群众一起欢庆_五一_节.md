Proletarian fighters and friends from five continents, together with the revolutionary masses of the capital, joyfully celebrated May Day in the center of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—Beijing. On this festive occasion, they saw our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. They enthusiastically applauded Chairman Mao and raised their arms to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They expressed their best wishes to Chairman Mao in the most beautiful language, wishing him eternal life.

At noon today, our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, along with other central leaders, arrived at the Labor People's Cultural Palace in an open-top car. At that moment, the Labor People's Cultural Palace was filled with thunderous cheers, and millions of red hearts flew towards Chairman Mao. Some foreign friends stood in the crowd, excitedly shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" They told their Chinese comrades, "You are very fortunate, and we are also fortunate! Since we came to China, we have been eagerly waiting day and night to see Chairman Mao, and today we finally saw him clearly." Some African friends said, "Chairman Mao is the red sun in our hearts." The Cameroonian youth friend Houmaru said, "I saw the great leader Chairman Mao, and I can't express the joy in my heart. I feel extremely happy today. I want to represent the youth of Africa to wish Chairman Mao eternal life." The leader of the Burundi Revolutionary Youth Organization delegation, Francois Kisamare, excitedly told his Chinese comrades, "I saw Chairman Mao!" He said, "Mao Zedong Thought not only guides the Chinese people but also guides the people of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and its lackeys."

Many foreign friends, on this day of celebrating the unity and struggle of the working class and the laboring people, expressed their love for our great leader Chairman Mao in various ways. They held up red copies of Chairman Mao's quotations, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" with the revolutionary masses who welcomed them. They sang "The East Is Red" together with the Red Guards. The Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) Japan-China Travel Agency delegation today wore the red armbands given to them by the revolutionary youth of our country and held up bright red banners at Zhongshan Park. The banners read: "Long live the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao! Long live the brilliant star of world revolution, Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China! Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan! Long live the unity of all proletarians of the world!" The leader of the delegation, Tsuchiya Atsushi, said, "The only way for the working class to achieve true liberation is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought, because Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology for the liberation of all mankind." The British friend Hong Ruoshi said, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world's people. Chairman Mao celebrating May Day with the people today is also a matter of great celebration for the people of the world."

Many foreign friends, in their cordial conversations with the revolutionary masses and Red Guards of the capital, highly praised our great leader Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

The leader of the New Zealand Communist Party delegation, member of the New Zealand Communist Party National Committee Political Committee, Ralph Hegeman, said: Seven hundred million Chinese people are carrying out an unprecedented, greatest revolution in human history. The people here deeply understand the lessons of the Soviet Union. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to ensure that socialist countries are not corrupted by bourgeois ideology. The method of carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to spread and study and apply the teachings of the great leader, statesman, and thinker of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. At the end of his speech, he shouted, "Long live proletarian internationalism! Long live the great Communist Party of China! Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of New Zealand and China! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), Osvaldo Becchi, and the member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, Livio Risaliti, were warmly welcomed by the Red Guards and revolutionary masses of the capital during their garden tour. The deputy chairman of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Nie Yuanzi, firmly shook Risaliti's hand and said, "In the high tide of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, you came to China to visit, which is a great encouragement to us. We warmly welcome you!" Risaliti said, "We firmly support China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will also draw rich experience from China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has already made great contributions to the struggle against imperialism and revisionism." The chairman of the Progressive Workers' Movement of Canada, Jack Scott, said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader Chairman Mao in China ensures that China will not take the revisionist road. The Sudanese friend Awad said that the people of Africa firmly believe that the assistance of the Chinese people to the world revolution is sincere. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution being carried out in China will promote the liberation struggle of the African people. The chairman of the "Know China Society" in Geneva, Switzerland, Leon Buffa, filmed the scene of the revolutionary youth performing "The Sunflower Turns to the Sun." He said that the spiritual outlook of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully proves that Mao Zedong Thought is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The Congolese friend Bindi said that China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an irresistible tide that sweeps away all demons. Imperialism is very afraid. Now, China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is no longer a matter of one country; victory will definitely belong to all the oppressed people of the world. The Malian friend Sisi said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao defends and develops Marxism-Leninism.

Today's celebration was filled with the atmosphere of proletarian internationalist unity and struggle. The American progressive writer Anna Louise Strong, the American friend Li Dunbai, the secretary-general of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Chard, the secretary-general of the Asian-African Writers' Permanent Bureau, Senanayake, and the revolutionary masses of the capital together held up red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" The American friend Robert Williams saw friends from five continents gathered together and felt that the strength of the struggle had increased. He excitedly said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, the Chinese people!" Some friends from Albania and Indonesia, when meeting with the deputy chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Committee, Chen Yonggui, praised Dazhai Brigade for its self-reliance spirit under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Chen Yonggui warmly shook hands with them and expressed his determination to strive for the cause of world revolution.
