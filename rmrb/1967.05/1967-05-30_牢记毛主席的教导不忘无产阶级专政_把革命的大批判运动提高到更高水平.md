After studying Comrade Lin Biao's letter to the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission and the "Summary of the Talks," the revolutionary masses of the proletariat throughout the country have come to understand even more deeply that class struggle is long-term and complex. They must uphold the spirit of thorough revolution, be prepared to fight for decades, for a hundred years, for several hundred years, until they create a new world of communism bathed in the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 29th, the publication of Comrade Lin Biao's letter to the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission and the "Summary of the Talks" convened by Comrade Jiang Qing has greatly inspired the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary cultural workers across the country. They have expressed their determination to, with the current revolutionary struggle tasks in mind, study the great historical document—the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Notice," study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," study Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art, and seriously study the "Summary of the Talks." They will carry out a deeper and higher-level criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pushing this great criticism and struggle to new heights and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as revolutionary cultural workers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guizhou, and other places, have all studied the "Summary of the Talks" in conjunction with their struggle practices over the past year. They have come to recognize even more deeply the great practical significance and profound historical significance of this important document. The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat have pointed out that the "Summary of the Talks," which Chairman Mao revised three times, and the "Outline Report" meticulously crafted by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique under the support of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, are two diametrically opposed documents. The former is a red flag for the proletariat to launch a great counterattack against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; the latter is a black flag for the bourgeoisie to launch a fierce attack against the proletariat. These two documents are also two orders issued from two command centers representing different classes, proposing two opposite directions of struggle. The great historical document, the "Summary of the Talks," has given the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique and their ultimate backer—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—a heavy blow. It has armed the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and sounded the charge for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary cultural workers in various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have said that Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in his letter to the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission: "Over the past sixteen years, there has been sharp class struggle on the cultural front. The question of who will defeat whom has not been resolved. If the proletariat does not occupy this position, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. Struggle is inevitable. This is an extremely broad and profound socialist revolution in the realm of ideology. If it is not done well, revisionism will emerge. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and unswervingly carry this revolution through to the end." This is Comrade Lin Biao's scientific summary, using Mao Zedong Thought, of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the realm of ideology since the founding of the nation.

Li Chun Kai, a member of the Revolutionary Command Committee of the Taiyuan Chemical Fertilizer Factory in Shanxi Province, said: Since the founding of the nation, the cultural front has seen one shocking class struggle after another, all centered around the issue of power, just as the "Summary of the Talks" pointed out. This is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership on the cultural front. A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support and protection of the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, have been in control of the leadership of the cultural world. They refuse to implement the revolutionary literary and artistic line of our great leader Chairman Mao and stubbornly promote a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, filling the cultural stage of socialist China with the garbage of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, preparing public opinion for counter-revolutionary restoration, and attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must seize all cultural power from the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory pointed out in a discussion that the "Summary of the Talks" is a revolutionary battle cry issued by the proletarian command. It is the battle program of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is a powerful ideological weapon for thoroughly criticizing and exposing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the past, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with the support of their ultimate backer, openly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and seized our power. We must resolutely seize back the leadership of the cultural front and let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all cultural positions.

A worker from the revolutionary faction of the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory and the head of the creation team for the large-scale opera "January Storm" said: The "Summary of the Talks" and the "Outline Report" crafted by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique under the support of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are two diametrically opposed documents, reflecting the sharp struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the cultural front in our country. We must never forget this history of class struggle, never forget class struggle, and never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We, the working class, must not only become the masters of the state in political life but also the masters on the cultural stage. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must firmly grasp the power of the cultural stage in our own hands and let the brilliance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line forever shine on the cultural stage!

Wang Dehe, the director of the Revolutionary Committee of Yangtan Brigade, Quwo County, Shanxi Province, a famous national cotton-growing labor model, said: The "Summary of the Talks" is a powerful weapon for launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and for fighting against revisionism and smashing the restoration of capitalism. With it, our hearts are redder, our eyes are brighter, we recognize the class enemy more clearly, aim more accurately, and strike harder. With it, we will be invincible in attack and victory is guaranteed. All class enemies will be defeated by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat armed with Mao Zedong Thought, falling like flowers and being crushed to pieces!

The young Red Guards of the Taigu No. 5 Middle School Jinguangshan Column of the Shanxi Revolutionary Rebel Corps said: The "Summary of the Talks" is a brilliant example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Jiang Qing is a loyal executor and brave defender of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We must study this document well and seriously study Comrade Jiang Qing's fearless revolutionary spirit. We must always follow Chairman Mao in making revolution and always be the vanguard and pioneers in defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the direct organs of Pinggu County, Beijing suburbs, said: The "Summary of the Talks" has added boundless fighting strength to our thorough implementation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With this powerful weapon that shines with the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, we fear neither heaven nor earth, nor ghosts, nor all reactionaries. We, these "little people," will definitely pull down these "big people"—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—and thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow them.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary cultural workers across the country have said that the "Summary of the Talks" points out: "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to continue the struggle." We must always remember Chairman Mao's instructions. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be resolved over a very long historical period. We must not think that one or two, three or four Cultural Revolutions will bring eternal peace. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, must uphold the spirit of continuous and thorough revolution, be prepared to fight for decades, for a hundred years, for several hundred years, until we create a new world of communism bathed in the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    牢记毛主席的教导不忘无产阶级专政  把革命的大批判运动提高到更高水平
    全国无产阶级革命派学习林彪同志给中央军委常委的信和《座谈会纪要》后，更加懂得阶级斗争是长期的、复杂的，一定要发扬彻底革命的精神，准备斗它几十年，斗它一百年，斗它几百年，直到斗出一个毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的共产主义新世界。
    据新华社二十九日讯　林彪同志给中央军委常委的信、林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要的公开发表，使各地广大工农兵群众和革命的文艺工作者受到了新的巨大鼓舞。他们表示，一定要带着当前的革命斗争任务，结合学习伟大的历史文件——中共中央《通知》，学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，学习毛主席关于文艺的五个文件，认真学习《座谈会纪要》，更深入、更高水平地进行对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，把这场大批判、大斗争推向新高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    北京、上海、山西、黑龙江、山东、贵州等地广大工农兵群众和革命文艺工作者纷纷结合一年来的斗争实践学习了《座谈会纪要》，更加深刻地认识到这个重要文件的极大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。广大无产阶级革命派指出，经过毛主席三次审阅修改的《座谈会纪要》，和彭真反革命修正主义集团在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持下精心炮制的《汇报提纲》，是两个根本对立的文件。前者是无产阶级向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动大反击的一面红旗；后者是资产阶级向无产阶级进行猖狂进攻的一面黑旗。这两个文件也是从两个代表不同阶级的司令部里发出的两种号令，提出了两种相反的斗争方向。《座谈会纪要》这个伟大的历史文件，给彭真反革命修正主义集团以及他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派当头一棒，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了广大无产阶级革命派，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的冲锋号。
    各省市、自治区的广大无产阶级革命派和革命文艺工作者说，林彪同志在给中央军委常委的信中指出：“十六年来，文艺战线上存在着尖锐的阶级斗争，谁战胜谁的问题还没有解决。文艺这个阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领，斗争是不可避免的。这是在意识形态领域里极为广泛、深刻的社会主义革命，搞不好就会出修正主义。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地把这一场革命进行到底。”这是林彪同志运用毛泽东思想，对建国以来意识形态领域内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，作出的科学总结。
    山西省太原化肥厂革命造反联合指挥部常委李春开说：建国以来，文艺战线上一场接着一场的惊心动魄的阶级斗争，始终都是围绕着政权这个问题进行的，正象《座谈会纪要》指出的，这是无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的斗争。一小撮反革命修正主义分子在其总后台党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持和包庇下，把持着文艺界的领导大权，他们拒不执行我们伟大领袖毛主席的革命文艺路线，顽固地推行一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，使社会主义中国的文艺舞台上，充塞着封建主义、资本主义和修正主义垃圾，为反革命复辟进行舆论准备，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。我们无产阶级革命派一定要把文艺大权从一小撮反革命修正主义分子手里统统夺回来。哈尔滨林业机械厂毛泽东思想宣传队在座谈中指出，《座谈会纪要》是无产阶级司令部发出来的革命的战斗号角。它是无产阶级文化大革命的战斗纲领，它是彻底批倒批臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，巩固无产阶级专政的有力的思想武器。过去，文艺界党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在他们的总后台的支持下，公然与毛主席的革命文艺路线相对抗，专了我们的政。我们要坚决把文化战线上的领导大权夺回来，让毛泽东思想占领一切文化阵地。
    上海玻璃机械厂革命派工人、大型歌舞剧《一月风暴》创作组的负责人说：《座谈会纪要》与彭真反革命修正主义集团在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持下炮制的《汇报提纲》，是两个根本对立的文件，反映了我国文化战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐的斗争。我们永远不能忘记这段阶级斗争的历史，永远不能忘记阶级斗争，永远不能忘记无产阶级专政。我们工人阶级不仅要在政治生活中成为国家的主人，在文艺舞台上也要成为主人。我们无产阶级革命派要把文艺舞台的大权牢牢掌握在自己手里，让毛主席的革命文艺路线的光辉永远照耀着文艺舞台！
    全国著名植棉劳动模范、山西省曲沃县杨谈大队革命委员会主任王德合说：《座谈会纪要》是向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的强大武器，是同修正主义作斗争、粉碎资本主义复辟的强大武器。有了它，我们心更红、眼更亮，对阶级敌人认得更清、瞄得更准、打得更狠。有了它，我们攻必克，战必胜，一切阶级敌人都将被用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派打得落花流水、粉身碎骨！
    山西革命造反兵团太原五中井冈山纵队的红卫兵小将们说：《座谈会纪要》是活学活用毛主席著作的光辉典范。江青同志是毛主席的革命路线的忠实执行者和勇敢的捍卫者。我们一定要好好地学习这个文件，认真学习江青同志的大无畏革命精神，永远跟着毛主席闹革命，永远做保卫毛主席革命路线的尖兵和闯将。
    北京郊区平谷县直属机关的无产阶级革命派说：《座谈会纪要》给我们彻底搞好无产阶级文化大革命增添了无穷的战斗力量。我们掌握起这一闪耀着光焰无际的毛泽东思想光辉的强大武器，就天不怕，地不怕，鬼不怕，一切反动派都不怕。我们这些“小人物”就一定能把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派这些“大人物”拉下马，把他们彻底斗臭、斗倒、斗垮。
    各地广大无产阶级革命派和革命文艺工作者说，《座谈会纪要》指出：“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。”我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。我们无产阶级革命派，一定发扬不断革命、彻底革命的精神，准备斗它几十年，斗它一百年，斗它几百年，直到斗出一个在毛泽东思想光辉普照下的红彤彤的新世界。
