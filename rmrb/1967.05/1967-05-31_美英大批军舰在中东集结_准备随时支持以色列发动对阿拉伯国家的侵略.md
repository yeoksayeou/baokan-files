In recent days, U.S. and British imperialists have been mobilizing a large number of warships, rushing to the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea to gather, preparing to support Israel in launching an invasion of Arab countries.

According to Western news agencies, most of the ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet have already gathered in the eastern Mediterranean, "prepared to deal with possible hostile actions." The flagship of the Sixth Fleet, the missile cruiser "Little Rock," has already sailed to the vicinity of Crete Island, joining three U.S. aircraft carriers, one cruiser, and four destroyers. Among them, the aircraft carrier "Intrepid" was en route to Vietnam but was detained. In addition, six other U.S. ships, including tank landing ships and transport ships, have been ordered to sail to the Ionian Sea between Greece and Italy. A few days ago, 2,000 U.S. Marines, aboard six landing craft, departed from Naples, Italy, heading towards Israel.

Currently, a U.S. destroyer active off the eastern coast of Africa is heading towards the Red Sea to join two other U.S. ships there, threatening the Gulf of Aqaba, which has been blockaded by the United Arab Republic, from the south.

The British Navy is coordinating with the U.S. military deployment, rapidly gathering forces in the Middle East. In Malta, the British aircraft carrier "Victorious" and four fast frigates have already gathered. On the 27th, two more British anti-submarine frigates were dispatched to Malta for reinforcement. In the Aden region at the southern end of the Red Sea, Britain has sent two fast ships and five minesweepers from the Persian Gulf. Additionally, the aircraft carrier "Hermes" was recalled at full speed from the Maldives in the Indian Ocean to Aden.

    美英大批军舰在中东集结
    准备随时支持以色列发动对阿拉伯国家的侵略
    据新华社三十日讯　连日来，美、英帝国主义在调动大批军舰，赶到东地中海和红海集结，准备随时支持以色列发动对阿拉伯国家的侵略。
    据西方通讯社报道，美国第六舰队的大部分舰只已在东地中海集结，“准备应付可能爆发的敌对行动”。第六舰队旗舰、导弹巡洋舰“小石城号”已经开到克里特岛附近，同美国的三艘航空母舰、一艘巡洋舰和四艘驱逐舰汇合。其中“勇猛号”航空母舰是在驶往越南途中，被留了下来的。此外，还有六艘美国舰只，包括坦克登陆舰和运输舰，也已奉命开往希腊和意大利之间的爱奥尼亚海。几天前，两千名美国海军陆战队分乘六艘登陆人员运输舰离开了意大利的那不勒斯港，向以色列方向调动。
    目前在非洲东部海岸活动的一艘美国驱逐舰，正开向红海，与在那里的两艘美国军舰汇合，从南面威胁已经被阿联封锁的亚喀巴湾。
    英国海军也配合美国的军事部署，加紧在中东地区集结。在马耳他，已经集结有英国航空母舰“胜利号”和四艘快速护卫舰。二十七日，又有两艘英国反潜艇护卫舰被派往马耳他增援。在红海南端的亚丁地区，英国已从波斯湾调来了两艘快速舰和五艘扫雷艇。另外，又从印度洋的马尔代夫群岛把航空母舰“赫姆斯号”全速召回亚丁。
