We have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions that the People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left, and in late February, we arrived at the Datong Coal Mine. Together with the revolutionary masses of the Datong Coal Mine, we have raised high the invincible red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly exposed the class struggle in the mining area, and supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In just over a month, the mining area has undergone earth-shaking changes. The spiritual face of the workers has been completely renewed, attendance rates have continuously increased, and production has presented a thriving and prosperous scene. The output of raw coal has steadily increased, nearly doubling compared to before the seizure of power.

Experience has proven that the People's Liberation Army has much work to do in supporting industry. However, the most fundamental task is to support politically and ideologically, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the revolutionary masses. Especially by grasping the class struggle, helping the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, resolutely executing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, relying on their own strength, carrying out the Cultural Revolution within their units, and promoting the development of production in the mining area. The soldiers and officers of the army regard the propagation of Mao Zedong Thought as the most important and most glorious task.

Exposing the class struggle, correctly identifying cadres, and realizing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"

Datong Coal Mine is one of the important coal production bases in our country, known as the "coal sea." However, for many years, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have been colluding with traitors, forming cliques, and controlling the power here. They have vigorously resisted Mao Zedong Thought, peddled revisionist black goods, and promoted peaceful evolution, attempting to lead the enterprise onto the capitalist path. Since the Cultural Revolution, they have stubbornly executed the reactionary bourgeois line, suppressing revolutionary masses, striking revolutionary cadres, and implementing the policy of "striking a large area and protecting a small group." They have also promoted counter-revolutionary economism, inciting workers to leave their production posts, suppressing the revolution, and sabotaging production. They have also colluded with the ghosts and snakes of society, manipulating conservative forces, and staged a fake seizure of power on January 20. In a short period, the office work was paralyzed, labor discipline was relaxed, and coal production declined. The class struggle in the mining area was extremely sharp and complex.

Following Chairman Mao's instruction that "without investigation, there can be no right to speak," we conducted investigations among the masses. A large amount of facts showed that the cover of class struggle in the mining area had not been completely lifted. The power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road were still at large, and the heads of their puppet organizations were still continuing their sabotage activities; the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who persisted in their reactionary stance had not been struck down, and their reactionary arrogance was still rampant, seriously disrupting the revolutionary order and production order; the masses had not been fully mobilized, and a powerful proletarian revolutionary faction had not yet formed, and revolutionary leading cadres had not yet come forward to "appear."

In response to this situation, we organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle, mobilized the masses to thoroughly expose the cover of class struggle, and through big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions, launched a total attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we did political and ideological work on the conservative organizations, and many deceived masses awakened, causing these organizations to quickly disintegrate. The landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who were engaged in sabotage activities also received serious blows.

When the revolutionary masses of the proletariat were weak, they were suppressed and persecuted by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They fought back resolutely, engaging in a sharp struggle with the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. After the army arrived in the mining area, it resolutely supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and they became even more enthusiastic, raising high the great banner of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, charging into battle, growing stronger with each fight, and rapidly developing and expanding. In the battle, the army and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat established a deep friendship.

The fierce class struggle severely tested the cadre team. Most of the cadres in Datong Coal Mine are good or relatively good. However, due to the deception and cover-up by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, many cadres executed the reactionary bourgeois line during the Cultural Revolution and were criticized by the masses. Some had "grievances," waiting to be "dismissed," waiting to be "struck down," and dared not come forward to revolutionize. A few masses, influenced by the reactionary bourgeois line, also had some wrong ideas regarding the cadre issue. In response to these problems, we used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, on the one hand, solving the problem of how cadres should correctly handle the opinions of the masses and correctly handle themselves; on the other hand, solving the problem of how the masses should correctly view cadres.

We organized revolutionary masses to study Chairman Mao's instructions on identifying cadres: "One must be good at identifying cadres. Not only should one look at the deeds of a cadre at a particular time, but also at the entire history and work of the cadre. This is the main method of identifying cadres." We also combined the actual situation with the relevant editorials from central newspapers and magazines to gradually unify everyone's understanding.

The army and the revolutionary masses of the mining area worked together to use the method of class analysis to conduct specific analyses of mid-level and above leading cadres. We comprehensively looked at their past, while also looking at their performance during the Cultural Revolution; we looked at the nature of their mistakes, as well as their attitude towards their mistakes; most importantly, we looked at their attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Through in-depth and detailed analysis and research, we had a clearer understanding of the cadre team. For example, there was a former deputy secretary of the Mining Bureau Party Committee who persisted in his reactionary stance and did many bad things. However, he disguised himself, retreated to the background, and deceived the masses. This time, he was exposed by the revolutionary masses. There was also a deputy director of the Political Department who had performed well in the past and paid attention to highlighting proletarian politics in his work. However, during the Cultural Revolution, he was used by the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road and, for a period, executed the reactionary bourgeois line. The revolutionary masses believed that he should be criticized and educated, and encouraged to stand up.

For some cadres who made mistakes, we and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, following Chairman Mao's instructions, adopted the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones, curing the sickness to save the patient," and "unity-criticism-unity." We conducted ideological education for them, helped them study Chairman Mao's works, and encouraged them to break with personal interests and establish public interests, to stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and to break with the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. We asked them to execute Chairman Mao's instructions: "You must put politics in command, go to the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution better." Through a series of political and ideological work, after criticism and struggle, many revolutionary cadres stood up.

In the fierce storm of class struggle, the conditions for realizing the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" were formed. On March 25, the mining area established a revolutionary committee, seizing back the power usurped by the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road. A new page in the history of the coal sea was opened.

Intensifying class education, criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and raising the class consciousness of the workers

The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the mining area vigorously opposed Mao Zedong Thought and opposed highlighting proletarian politics. They promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, advocating money as the commander and material incentives, using these to corrupt the worker masses. Some workers were poisoned by this, not caring about state affairs, and only caring about personal interests. Some had blurred class views, and the evil winds were quite serious. This was a serious consequence of the evil activities of the class enemy.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to wage a great political struggle. If this task is not solved, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." We firmly grasped the class struggle, using Chairman Mao's class and class struggle views to educate and arm the masses, making the broad masses raise their class consciousness, ignite revolutionary spirit, rely on their own strength, and uproot the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, this big mountain pressing on their heads, and eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Many old workers suffered class exploitation and oppression in the old society, and the whips of feudal bosses left scars on their bodies. Most young workers also come from the families of workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and other laboring people. They have deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao and have a deep hatred for the class enemy. This is a very favorable condition for us to carry out class education.

We and the workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "Class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment are three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state. They are the reliable guarantees for preventing bureaucratism, avoiding revisionism and dogmatism, and ensuring that communists stand unshakable; they are the reliable guarantees for the proletariat to unite with the broad laboring masses and implement democratic dictatorship. Otherwise, if the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and snakes all come out, and our cadres do nothing, and many even cannot distinguish between the enemy and us, collude with each other, and are corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, divided and dissolved, pulled out and pushed in, many workers, peasants, and intellectuals are also corrupted by the enemy in various ways, then it will not take much time, in a few years or a dozen years, or even a few dozen years, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

With Chairman Mao's instructions, comparing them with the situation in the mine, the workers were shocked, seeing clearly that the class enemy's promotion of material incentives and money as the commander was an attempt to destroy socialism and restore capitalism. Some said, the class enemy used revisionism to poison workers, making them indifferent to politics, numb to the class enemy's sabotage activities, and blind to them, thus opening a "free market" for their counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Others said, in the past, they thought that whoever gave more money was a good cadre, not realizing that they had fallen for the enemy's sugar-coated bullets, which was the enemy using a soft knife to cut our heads, and the methods of the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road were indeed vicious! This criticism was a great cleansing of the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "If one does not understand what class is, does not understand what exploitation is, one does not understand revolution." Based on Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, we widely carried out "remembering bitterness and thinking sweetness" among workers, cadres, and family members. We recalled the bitterness of the old society, denounced the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and denounced the crimes of the reactionary bourgeois line. We held meetings in work teams and family compounds, where workers and soldiers recalled and denounced together, pouring out their class bitterness and shouting for revenge. Through remembering bitterness and thinking sweetness, everyone realized that the root of suffering and oppression was that the power in the mine was not in the hands of the working class. With power, there is everything; without power, there is nothing. This further ignited their hatred for the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, making them feel even more the great significance of Chairman Mao initiating the Cultural Revolution, and more recognizing the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. An old worker said, comparing the new and old societies, it is truly one in heaven and one on earth. Today, the class enemy opposes the Party and Chairman Mao, attempting to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship state and restore capitalism, which we will never allow, and we must seize back the power and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life. Some workers, with tears in their eyes, looked at Chairman Mao's portrait and said: "Chairman Mao, without you, there would be no today for us!" They expressed that the sea could dry up, and the stones could rot, but their red hearts following Chairman Mao in revolution would never change. They told the soldiers: "Please convey to Chairman Mao, please let him rest assured, we workers will definitely most resolutely respond to his call, grasp the revolution, promote production, smash all the tricks of the class enemy, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end."

"Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The spiritual face of the workers has undergone a profound change, and they have shown great proletarian aspirations. Workers said: "People change, the environment changes, politics takes the lead, thoughts are revolutionized, and enthusiasm breaks through the sky." Some workers said: "In the past, the power-holders who are taking the capitalist road used money to corrupt workers, often failing to complete production quotas. Now the army has brought Mao Zedong Thought, we understand laboring for the revolution and serving the people, enthusiasm is endless and inexhaustible, and we overfulfill production every day." After the masses grasped Mao Zedong Thought, the great material force it generated also educated the cadres of the mining area. Some cadres said: "In the past, production did not go well, blaming workers for not listening, now I understand, it is not that workers do not listen, but that I did not listen to Chairman Mao. In the future, I must use revolution to lead production and drive production."

Promoting the "four firsts," carrying the "three-eighths style," and setting an example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works

Following Chairman Mao's instructions that "the vanguard and model role of Communist Party members is very important" and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions that "'personal example' is more important than 'verbal instruction,'" we, together with the workers, promoted the "four firsts," carried the "three-eighths style," and set an example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our common battles, labor, and study.

We organized large, medium, and small Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams and propaganda groups in the army, entering every corner of the mining area, using various propaganda tools, and widely promoting, studying, and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

Where there were masses, we went there to propagate. The mine is the frontline of seizing the revolution and promoting production, with many people, the most intense production, the most arduous work, the most active thoughts, and the most need for Mao Zedong Thought. The officers and soldiers of the army rushed into the mine, worked in shifts, and became propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, making the political atmosphere in the mine thick, and creating a good environment for promoting the revolutionization of workers' thoughts.

A new leading cadre team was established, and how to make this team a revolutionary team is a very important issue. We believe that this team must be one that raises high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, is revolutionary in thought, and serves the people wholeheartedly; it must highlight proletarian politics, let politics command production, and not let money command production; it must have a style of being swift and decisive and deep in the masses, and not a style of dragging feet and bureaucratism. In short, this team should be a command center of politics and thought, and not just a command center of production. For this, we studied with them "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's instructions on "politics is the commander, is the soul," "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." We also helped them train political work cadres.

When the Party Central Committee issued the letter to the revolutionary workers and cadres of all factories and mines across the country, the army immediately formed large propaganda teams to propagate. Some leading comrades of the army, together with the leading cadre team, rushed into the mine, with the greatest enthusiasm and the fastest speed, conveyed Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's great call to the worker masses, making it the action guideline for the broad masses of workers, and a powerful force for "seizing the revolution and promoting production." The workers excitedly said: "This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest support, and greatest encouragement for us miners," expressing "a thousand supports and a million executions." We did this, and the education of the leading cadre team members was very deep. The leading cadre team members, in addition to immediately studying this letter themselves, also organized all cadres and teachers in the offices and schools to enter various teams, helping workers study this letter.

The leading comrades of the army personally went to the frontline of production, both as laborers and propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought, working and doing political and ideological work at the same time. The leading cadre team also left the office and went to the frontline of production. When they discussed measures to improve production, they listed studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the first item. When they reported on production, they first reported on the situation of studying Chairman Mao's works and the thoughts of the workers.

The soldiers went down the mine, worked hard first, and took heavy burdens everywhere. When working, they picked up the hammer to hit the pillars and picked up the shovel to load the coal. Where there was danger, they went there. When resting, they talked with the workers and studied Chairman Mao's works together with everyone. An old worker said: "You working hard or not in the mine is not a big deal, we can do it with a little more effort. The most important thing is that you gave us workers Mao Zedong Thought, which is our lifeline!" Following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on humbly learning from the local area, the army party committee proposed to all soldiers and officers that they should humbly and sincerely learn from the worker masses in thought and action. The soldiers and officers, in their common battles, labor, and study with the workers, deepened their understanding of the working class. They saw with their own eyes that the broad worker masses had unlimited love for Chairman Mao, doing as Chairman Mao said; they saw their selfless labor and fearlessness of danger, the true colors of the proletariat. They personally felt the class love of the workers for the soldiers, giving light work to the soldiers and keeping heavy work for themselves; where there was danger, they did not let the soldiers go, but went themselves. The soldiers and officers of the army received profound education. The soldiers said, we have a deeper understanding of the great public-spiritedness and fearlessness of the working class, and we must humbly learn from the workers.

All our soldiers and officers are determined to, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction of the mining area, raise higher the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, grasp the revolution, promote production, and strive to make Datong Coal Mine a new-type socialist enterprise and the mining area a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    用毛泽东思想支援工业
    解放军某部支援大同煤矿毛泽东思想宣传队
    我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众的伟大指示，在二月下旬，来到了大同煤矿，和大同煤矿的革命群众一道，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大揭矿区的阶级斗争的盖子，支持矿区的无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。在短短一个多月的时间里，矿区发生了翻天覆地的变化。职工的精神面貌焕然一新，出勤率不断提高，生产呈现出一片欣欣向荣的大好局面，原煤产量稳步上升，比夺权前猛增将近一倍。
    经验证明，人民解放军支援工业有很多工作要做。但是，最根本的是从政治思想上支援，用毛泽东思想武装革命群众。特别是抓住阶级斗争这条纲，帮助无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，依靠自己的力量，搞好本单位的无产阶级文化大革命，促进矿区的生产发展。部队指战员把宣传毛泽东思想看做是最重要、最光荣的任务。
    大揭阶级斗争的盖子，正确识别干部，实现革命的“三结合”
    大同煤矿是我国重要的煤炭生产基地之一，号称煤海。但是，多年来，矿区内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，招降纳叛，结党营私，控制了这里的大权。他们百般抵制毛泽东思想，大肆贩卖修正主义的黑货，大搞和平演变，企图把企业引上资本主义的邪路。无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们顽固地执行资产阶级反动路线，镇压革命群众，打击革命干部，实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”。他们还大搞反革命经济主义，煽动工人离开生产岗位，压制革命，破坏生产。他们还勾结社会上的牛鬼蛇神，操纵保守势力，于一月二十日炮制了假夺权的丑剧。在短暂的时间内，机关工作瘫痪，劳动纪律松弛，煤炭生产下降。矿区的阶级斗争形势十分尖锐复杂。
    我们遵照毛主席关于“没有调查就没有发言权”的教导，深入群众中进行调查。大量的事实说明，矿区的阶级斗争盖子并没有完全揭开。走资本主义道路的当权派逍遥法外，他们操纵的御用组织的一小撮头目还继续进行破坏活动；坚持反动立场的地、富、反、坏、右分子没有受到打击，反动气焰仍很嚣张，严重地破坏着革命秩序和生产秩序；群众发动不够，还没有形成强大的无产阶级革命派的队伍，革命的领导干部也没有站出来“亮相”。
    针对这种情况，我们组织群众学习毛主席有关阶级、阶级斗争的理论，放手发动群众，大揭阶级斗争的盖子，通过大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发动总攻击。我们和无产阶级革命派一道，对保守组织做政治思想工作，一些受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉醒，使这些组织迅速瓦解。进行破坏活动的地、富、反、坏、右分子，也受到了严重打击。
    无产阶级革命派，在力量薄弱的时候，受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的压制、迫害，他们坚强不屈，同走资本主义道路的当权派进行了针锋相对的斗争。部队来到矿区以后，对无产阶级革命派坚决支持，他们更是斗志昂扬，高举毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大旗，冲锋陷阵，越战越强，迅速发展壮大。在战斗中，部队和无产阶级革命派建立起了深厚的友谊。
    尖锐激烈的阶级斗争，严峻地考验了干部队伍。大同煤矿的干部，好的和比较好的占大多数。但是，由于党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的欺骗蒙蔽，不少干部在无产阶级文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线，群众批判了他们。有些人有“怨气”，等待“罢官”，等待“挨整”，不敢站出来革命。有少数群众在对待干部问题上，由于受到资产阶级反动路线的影响，也存在着一些错误思想。针对这些问题，我们以毛泽东思想为武器，一方面解决干部如何正确对待群众意见和正确对待自己的问题；一方面解决群众如何正确看待干部的问题。
    我们组织革命群众学习毛主席关于识别干部的教导：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”并结合实际情况，学习了中央报刊的有关社论，逐步统一了大家的认识。
    部队和矿区的革命群众组织一道，用阶级分析的方法，对中层以上的领导干部进行了具体分析。全面地看他们的过去，同时，又看他们在无产阶级文化大革命中的表现；看他们所犯错误的性质，也看他们对待错误的态度；最根本的是看他们对待毛泽东思想的态度，对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的态度。经过深入细致的分析研究，对干部队伍就有了比较清楚的了解。例如：有一个原矿务局党委副书记，坚持反动立场，干了许多坏事。但是，他乔装打扮，退居幕后，欺骗蒙蔽群众。这次被革命群众揭发出来了。还有一个政治部副主任，过去表现较好，工作中注意了突出无产阶级政治。但是，在无产阶级文化大革命中被走资本主义道路的当权派所利用，在一段时间内执行了资产阶级反动路线。革命群众认为，对于他应当经过批评教育，鼓励他站起来。
    对一些犯了错误的干部，我们和无产阶级革命派按照毛主席的教导，采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”，“团结——批评——团结”的方针，对他们进行思想教育，帮助他们学习毛主席著作，破私立公，要他们站在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边，和走资本主义道路的当权派一刀两断。要他们执行毛主席的指示：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”通过一系列的政治思想工作，经过批评和斗争，许多革命干部站了出来。
    在尖锐的阶级斗争的风浪中，实现革命的“三结合”的条件形成了。三月二十五日，矿区成立了革命委员会，夺回了一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所篡夺的大权。煤海在自己的历史上揭开了新的一页。
    大抓阶级教育，批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，提高职工的阶级觉悟
    矿区内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极力反对毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治。他们推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞金钱挂帅、物质刺激，以此来腐蚀工人群众。一些工人受了这种毒害，不关心国家大事，斤斤计较个人利益，有的人阶级观点模糊，歪风邪气也相当严重。这是阶级敌人进行罪恶活动所造成的严重后果。
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”我们紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲，用毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争观点，去教育群众、武装群众，使广大群众提高阶级觉悟，激发革命精神，依靠自己的力量，挖掉压在他们头上的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派这座大山，清除反革命修正主义的流毒。
    许多老工人在旧社会受过阶级剥削和阶级压迫，封建把头的皮鞭在他们身上留下了斑斑的伤痕。青年工人，绝大多数也是出身于工人、贫下中农和其他劳动人民的家庭。他们对党和毛主席都有深厚的阶级感情，对阶级敌人有着刻骨的仇恨。这是我们进行阶级教育的极其有利的条件。
    我们和工人一起反复学习毛主席的指示：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。不然的话，让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”以毛主席的教导，对照矿上的事情，职工们大吃一惊，看清了阶级敌人推行物质刺激、金钱挂帅，就是妄图搞垮社会主义，复辟资本主义。有的人说，阶级敌人用修正主义毒害工人，使工人不关心政治，对阶级敌人的破坏活动麻木不仁，熟视无睹，这就为他们进行反革命复辟活动开辟了“自由市场”。还有的人说，过去认为谁给钱多，谁就是好干部，没想到正中了敌人的糖衣炮弹，这是敌人用软刀子割我们的头，走资本主义道路的当权派的手段真毒辣啊！这次批判，是对反革命修正主义流毒的一次大清洗。
    林彪同志说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”根据林彪同志的这个指示，我们广泛地在工人、干部、家属中进行忆苦思甜。忆旧社会的阶级苦，控诉党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶，控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行。以作业队、家属院为单位召开会议，会上工人、战士同忆同诉，阶级苦水一起流，复仇呼声一齐喊。通过忆苦思甜，大家认识到，受苦、受压迫的根子是矿上的大权不在工人阶级手中。有了政权，就有了一切，失去政权，就失去了一切。这样，就进一步激发起他们对走资本主义道路当权派的憎恨，更感觉到毛主席发动无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，更认识到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的英明、伟大。一位老工人说，新旧社会两下一比，真是一个天上，一个地下。今天，阶级敌人反对党和毛主席，妄想推翻我们无产阶级专政的国家，复辟资本主义，我们决不允许，一定要把权夺回来，一辈子跟着毛主席闹革命。有的工人用激动的目光望着毛主席像说：“毛主席呀，没有你老人家，就没有我们的今天啊！”他们表示，海可枯，石可烂，跟着毛主席干革命的红心永不变。他们对着解放军同志说：请你们转告毛主席，请他老人家放心，我们工人阶级一定最坚决地响应他老人家的号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    “阶级斗争，一抓就灵”。职工们的精神面貌发生了深刻的变化，焕发出无产阶级的壮志豪情。工人们说：“人变环境变，政治领了先，思想革命化，干劲冲破天。”有的工人说：“过去，走资本主义道路的当权派，用钱来腐蚀工人，经常完不成生产定额。现在解放军送来了毛泽东思想，懂得了为革命劳动，为人民服务，干劲使不完、用不尽，天天超产。”毛泽东思想被群众掌握后，所产生的巨大物质力量，也教育了矿区的干部。有的干部说：“过去生产上不去，埋怨工人不听话，现在我明白了，不是工人不听话，而是我没听毛主席的话。往后，我一定要用革命统帅生产，带动生产。”
    传“四个第一”，带“三八作风”，树立活学活用毛主席著作的好样板
    我们遵照毛主席“共产党员的先锋作用和模范作用是十分重要的”教导，和林彪同志“‘身教’重于‘言教’”的指示，在与职工共同的战斗、劳动、学习中，传“四个第一”，带“三八作风”，树立活学活用毛主席著作的好样板。
    我们部队组织了大、中、小型的毛泽东思想宣传队、宣传组，深入矿区各个角落，利用各种宣传工具，大讲、大学、大用、大立毛泽东思想。
    那里有群众，我们就到那里宣传。井下是抓革命、促生产的第一线，人多，生产最紧张，工作最艰巨，活思想最多，最需要毛泽东思想。部队的干部和战士纷纷深入矿井，跟班劳动，做毛泽东思想的宣传员，把井下的政治空气搞得浓浓的，为促进工人思想革命化创造良好的环境。
    新的领导班子成立了，如何使这个班子成为革命的班子，这是一个很重要的问题。我们认为，这个班子必须是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的，在思想上是革命化的，全心全意为人民服务的；必须突出无产阶级政治，以政治统帅生产，而不是金钱统帅生产；必须具有雷厉风行、深入群众的作风，而不是拖拖拉拉、官僚主义的。一句话，这个班子应当成为政治思想的指挥部，而不是单纯的生产指挥部。为此，我们和他们一起学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于“政治是统帅，是灵魂”、“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导。还帮助他们训练政治工作干部。
    当党中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信发布后，部队立即组成大批宣传队进行宣传。部队一些领导同志同领导班子的同志一起，深入井下，以最大的热情，最快的速度，把毛主席和党中央的伟大号召传达给工人群众，使之成为广大职工行动的纲领，成为“抓革命，促生产”的强大动力。工人们激动地说：“这是毛主席对我们矿工的最大关怀，最大支持，最大鞭策”，表示“一千个拥护，一万个执行”。我们这样做，对领导班子的成员教育很深。领导班子的同志除了自己马上学习这封信外，并组织了机关、学校的全体干部和教员深入各队，帮助工人学习这封信。
    部队领导同志亲临生产第一线，既是劳动者，又是毛泽东思想宣传员，边劳动，边做政治思想工作。领导班子也离开办公室，深入生产第一线。他们抓生产时，不只是抓业务，还抓思想。讨论提高生产的措施时，把活学活用毛主席著作列为第一项。汇报生产时，首先汇报学习毛主席著作的情况和工人的思想情况。
    战士们下井后，劳动吃苦在前，处处挑重担子。劳动时，拿起大锤就打柱子，抄起铁锹就装煤。那里有危险，就往那里去。休息时，就和工人谈心，同大家一起学习毛主席著作。一位老工人说：“你们下井干多干少算不了什么，我们加点劲就干出来了。最重要的是你们送给我们工人的是毛泽东思想，这是我们的命根子！”
    遵照林彪同志关于虚心向地方学习的指示，部队党委向全体指战员提出，要从思想上、行动上，谦虚、诚恳地向职工群众学习。指战员在和工人同战斗、同劳动、同学习中，增进了对工人阶级的认识。亲眼看到广大工人群众无限热爱毛主席，毛主席咋说就咋办；看到他们忘我劳动、不畏艰险的无产阶级本色。亲身体会到工人对子弟兵的阶级友爱，轻活让给战士，重活留给自己；那里有危险，就不让战士去，而自己去。部队指战员受到了深刻的教育。战士们说，我们对工人阶级的大公无私、大无畏的革命精神，有了更深刻的了解，我们一定要虚心向工人学习。
    我们全体指战员决心同矿区的无产阶级革命派一起，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓革命，猛促生产。为把大同煤矿办成社会主义的新型企业、把矿区办成毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
