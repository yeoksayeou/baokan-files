One year ago, a delegation from heroic Albania, led by Comrade Shehu, visited China on a friendly tour and issued the China-Albania Joint Statement. This visit added a brilliant and unforgettable chapter to the history of the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania.

The China-Albania Joint Statement is a document filled with the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution and proletarian internationalism of Marxism-Leninism. This document hoists the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, firmly supports the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and points out the fighting tasks of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world. The document holds that it is necessary to adhere to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism, to adhere to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and to carry the socialist revolution to the end. The issuance of this document is of great significance in further strengthening and developing the unity, friendship, and cooperation between the two countries, and in defending Marxism-Leninism and the international proletarian revolutionary cause.

The past year has proven that the views expressed in the Joint Statement on a series of major issues in the international situation and the international communist movement are correct.

At present, we are in a new great era of world revolution. Before us is a very good situation. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world are developing deeply. The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionist leadership, and the reactionaries of various countries are finding it increasingly difficult to survive and are in a state of disintegration.

Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has shaken the world with its unparalleled mighty force. In this great revolution, hundreds of millions of people have exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and have launched a revolutionary criticism of the reactionary bourgeois line they have been implementing. The proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has achieved great victories. This great revolution has solved the problem of initiating a great revolution of hundreds of millions of people under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat; it has solved the problem of seizing power from the handful of power-holders within the organs of proletarian dictatorship who are taking the capitalist road; it has solved the problem of preventing capitalist restoration and ensuring that our socialist state will never change color. It has not only shattered the dreams of imperialism and modern revisionism of restoring capitalism in China, consolidated our proletarian dictatorship, but also opened up a new era in the international communist movement.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people have given high praise to China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is a great encouragement and support to our revolutionary proletarian forces and our people.

Over the past year, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people have achieved great successes in their socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism.

In his message of congratulations to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, Chairman Mao said: "Heroic Albania, the people's Albania, has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe." Today, this beacon shines with even brighter light.

The Albanian Labor Party has creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to the socialist revolution and socialist construction in their own country, and has taken a series of revolutionary measures in the political, economic, military, and cultural fields. Last year's Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party proposed to further deepen the ideological and cultural revolution, to firmly establish proletarian ideology, and to thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology. This not only provides a powerful guarantee for preventing capitalist restoration and consolidating and developing the socialist system, but also provides valuable experience for the history of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Albanian people, holding high the banner of struggle against imperialism and revisionism, resolutely oppose imperialism led by the United States, resolutely oppose the Soviet revisionist leadership and its followers, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation, and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. Heroic Albania is truly a strong shock troop of the world revolution.

The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people's daring spirit to fight against imperialism and its running dogs, and to fight against all enemies, has won the admiration of all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in the world. The facts have proven that in the international communist movement, a genuine proletarian party, as long as it is loyal to Marxism-Leninism and adheres to revolutionary principles, can make significant contributions to defending and developing Marxism-Leninism and promoting the revolutionary cause of the world proletariat.

As Chairman Mao has said, the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people are towering mountains that reach the sky, while the Soviet revisionist leadership and all kinds of traitors and renegade cliques are nothing but a handful of yellow earth.

Over the past year, the traitorous nature of the Soviet revisionist leadership has been further exposed. They have fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union and in the capitalist world, they strive to maintain the rule of imperialism and colonialism. They have become even more brazen in betraying the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world and actively serving American imperialism. They have degenerated into outright lackeys and accomplices of imperialism. In the sharp struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, the big and small followers of the Soviet revisionist leadership have also revealed their true colors, proving that they are a bunch of traitors to Marxism-Leninism and scabs of the working class. All Marxist-Leninists in the world, in order to advance the revolutionary cause of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world, must carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership to the end.

The friendship and unity between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania have been further consolidated and developed over the past year. The Chinese people and the Albanian people are true friends and comrades, not the kind of false friends and two-faced people who are sweet-talking but treacherous. Our friendship is a revolutionary friendship, a fighting friendship, based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, tempered and tested by storms and trials. We fight shoulder to shoulder against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, and support, help, learn from, and encourage each other in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. The continuous strengthening of the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania is of great significance in promoting the development of Marxist-Leninist forces and revolutionary forces in all countries of the world, and in achieving greater victories in the international proletarian revolutionary cause and the world people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.

No matter what happens in the world, the Chinese people will always stand together with the fraternal Albanian people, fight together, and win together.

Let us raise high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite with all Marxist-Leninists in the world, unite with all revolutionary peoples in the world, and fight resolutely and bravely to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, overthrow the reactionaries of all countries, and build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation!

### 中国阿尔巴尼亚永远战斗在一起

    中国阿尔巴尼亚永远战斗在一起
    一年前，来自英雄阿尔巴尼亚的使者，以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团在中国进行了友好访问，并且发表了中国阿尔巴尼亚联合声明。这次访问，在中阿两国人民的战斗友谊史上增添了令人难忘的光辉的一页。
    中国阿尔巴尼亚联合声明，是一个充满无产阶级彻底革命精神和无产阶级国际主义的马克思列宁主义的文件。这个文件，高举反帝反修的大旗，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，并且指出了全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的战斗任务。这个文件认为，必须坚持马克思列宁主义的革命路线，坚持无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底。这个文件的发表，对于进一步加强和发展中阿两国团结、友好和合作关系，对于捍卫马克思列宁主义和国际无产阶级革命事业，具有重要意义。
    一年来的事实证明，联合声明中对国际局势和国际共产主义运动的一系列重大问题的看法，都是正确的。
    目前，我们正处在世界革命的新的伟大的时代。呈现在我们面前的是一派大好形势。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和全世界人民的革命运动正在深入发展。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，日子越来越不好混，正陷于四分五裂的困境。
    一年来，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，以其无可比拟的巨大威力，震动了全世界。在这场大革命中，亿万人民把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪了出来，对他们执行的资产阶级反动路线展开了革命的大批判。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得了伟大的胜利。这场大革命，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下发动亿万人民进行大革命的问题；解决了向无产阶级专政机构内部一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行夺权斗争的问题；解决了防止资本主义复辟，保证我国社会主义江山永不变色的问题。它不仅粉碎了帝国主义和现代修正主义在中国复辟资本主义的梦想，巩固了我国的无产阶级专政，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，对中国的无产阶级文化大革命给予了高度的评价。这是对我国无产阶级革命派和我国人民的巨大支持和鼓舞。
    一年来，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反帝反修斗争中，取得了伟大的成就。
    毛主席在给阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”今天，这盏明灯放射出更加灿烂的光辉。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，创造性地把马克思列宁主义运用于本国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，在政治、经济、军事、文化等各方面，采取了一系列的革命化措施。去年召开的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会，提出了进一步深入开展思想文化革命，大立无产阶级思想，彻底破除资产阶级思想。这不仅为防止资本主义复辟、巩固和发展社会主义制度提供了有力的保证，而且为无产阶级专政的历史，提供了宝贵的经验。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举反帝反修的战斗旗帜，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义，坚决反对苏修领导集团及其追随者，坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，坚决支持各国人民的革命斗争。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚，不愧为世界革命的一支坚强的突击队。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，敢于同帝国主义及其走狗进行战斗，敢于同一切暴敌进行战斗的大无畏精神，受到世界上一切马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的敬佩。事实证明，在国际共产主义运动中，一个真正的无产阶级政党，只要是忠于马克思列宁主义，坚持革命原则，就能够为捍卫和发展马克思列宁主义，为促进世界无产阶级的革命事业作出重大的贡献。
    正象毛主席所说的，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民是耸入云霄的高山，而苏修领导集团和一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起他们来，都不过是一抔黄土。
    一年以来，苏修领导集团的叛徒面目进一步大暴露。他们在苏联全面实行资本主义复辟，在资本主义世界则竭力维护帝国主义、殖民主义统治。他们变本加厉地出卖世界革命人民的利益，积极为美帝国主义效劳。他们已堕落成为不折不扣的帝国主义的奴仆和帮凶。在马克思列宁主义和修正主义的尖锐斗争中，苏修领导集团的大大小小追随者，也都进一步现出了原形，证明他们是一伙马克思列宁主义的叛徒和工人阶级的工贼。全世界马克思列宁主义者，为了把国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命事业推向前进，必须把反对以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底。
    中阿两党和两国人民的友谊和团结，一年来有了进一步的巩固和发展。中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民是真正的朋友和同志，而不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友和两面派。我们的友谊是革命的友谊，战斗的友谊，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础之上的，是经过急风暴雨考验和锻炼的。我们在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中并肩战斗，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中互相支持，互相帮助，互相学习，互相鼓舞。中阿两党和两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结的不断加强，对于促进世界各国马克思列宁主义力量和革命派的发展，对于争取国际无产阶级革命事业和世界人民反帝革命斗争的更大胜利，具有十分重大的意义。
    不管世界上发生什么事情，中国人民都将同兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    让我们更高地举起马克思列宁主义的伟大红旗，同全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，同全世界革命人民团结起来，为打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派，为建立一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而坚持战斗，奋勇前进！
