Our great leader Chairman Mao, last year in March, personally revised and approved the "Summary of the Symposium on Army Literature and Art Work Held at the Request of Comrade Lin Biao by Comrade Jiang Qing." This symposium was a very important meeting in the history of our country's cultural struggle. This "Summary of the Symposium" is an extremely important document for our proletarian cultural revolution.

At that time, it was a critical moment of struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads within the country. In the realm of ideology and culture, this struggle was particularly concentrated, sharp, and intense. With the support and assistance of Comrade Lin Biao, Comrade Jiang Qing led revolutionary cultural workers of the army to break through numerous obstacles and, in opposition to the counter-revolutionary "February Outline," issued the "Summary of the Symposium on Army Literature and Art Work," launching a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

The "Summary of the Symposium" used the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major questions of the cultural revolution in the socialist period. The "Summary of the Symposium" upheld and defended Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. It specifically explained the great role of literature and art in the struggle against restoration and counter-restoration throughout the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship, and it delivered a powerful blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line supported by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. The "Summary of the Symposium" is a shining example of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. It is a scientific summary of the experience of creating new proletarian literary struggles. The "Summary of the Symposium" is a proclamation to attack the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line and to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. It not only has great practical significance but also has profound historical significance.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line." In the period of socialist revolution, literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics means serving to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and develop the socialist revolution. It means using a proletarian face to reform the Party and reform the world. The revolutionary or counter-revolutionary class that wants to seize political power always first seizes the literature and art front. The political struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, always first reflects in literature and art. In the entire historical period of proletarian dictatorship, the main content of class struggle is the struggle against restoration and counter-restoration, and the struggle against usurpation and counter-usurpation. The defeated class enemies always use literature and art, this important tool, to create public opinion for their restoration of capitalism; they attempt to reform the Party and the world with a bourgeois face and dream of turning proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings and never forget class struggle, especially not neglect the class struggle in the ideological and cultural realms including literature and art.

The "Summary of the Symposium" follows Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle in the socialist period, providing a comprehensive, profound, and correct analysis of the situation of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the literary front since liberation. It exposed a literary black line that is opposed to Mao Zedong Thought. This black line is the combination of bourgeois literary thought, modern revisionist literary thought, and so-called literary thought of the 1930s. This literary black line serves the counter-revolutionary revisionist political line advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. For more than a decade, a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists represented by Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and Xia Yan, with the support of their chief backer, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, have been waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, surrendering and collaborating, forming cliques, practicing deceit, acting arbitrarily, and seizing power in the literary circles. They have been preparing public opinion for the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party to realize his plot to usurp the Party, the army, and the state. The "Summary of the Symposium" raised the banner of revolutionary criticism and launched a fierce counterattack against the literary black line that serves the restoration of capitalism and its chief backer, winning the first battle.

The "Summary of the Symposium" emphasizes: "Our literature and art are proletarian literature and art, and they are the Party's literature and art. The proletarian party principle is our most distinctive mark distinguishing us from other classes. One must know that the representatives of other classes also have their party principles, and they are very tenacious. In terms of creative thought, organizational line, and work style, we must uphold the proletarian party principle and resist the infiltration of bourgeois thought. We must draw a clear line with bourgeois thought and cannot coexist peacefully." The proletariat must reform the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to reform the world according to its worldview. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, their struggle in the ideological realm, is like two armies in battle, always resulting in one winning and one losing. It is either we devour them, or they devour us. It is either we annihilate them, or they annihilate us. The war in the ideological and cultural realm cannot stop, and we cannot pursue peaceful coexistence. If anyone seeks peaceful coexistence with bourgeois thought and culture, it can only be a surrender to bourgeois thought and culture.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "The literary and art front, if the proletariat does not occupy it, the bourgeoisie will necessarily occupy it. The struggle is inevitable. This is an extremely broad and profound socialist revolution in the ideological realm, and if it is not handled well, revisionism will emerge." The first socialist country, the Soviet Union, was because it abandoned the class struggle in the ideological realm that the revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the Party and the state, implementing the restoration of capitalism. In other socialist countries, similar things have also happened. We must firmly learn from this serious lesson in the history of the international proletarian dictatorship.

Revolutionary literature and art must become a powerful tool to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, "making literature and art become a good part of the entire revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy."

While thoroughly criticizing the literary black line that serves the counter-revolutionary revisionist political line, the "Summary of the Symposium" also summarized valuable experience in establishing new proletarian literature and art. The "Summary of the Symposium" emphasizes that we must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics; follow the mass line and focus on creation; adopt the creative method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism, enthusiastically and in every possible way to create the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers heroes; strive to reflect the struggle life of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in socialist revolution and socialist construction; strongly advocate revolutionary, combative, and mass literary criticism, and put the weapon of literary criticism in the hands of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. To flourish socialist new literature and art, and promote the vigorous development of the proletarian revolutionary literary and art movement, we must place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. We must engage in long-term, in-depth struggle life, combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly reform our worldview, and accelerate the ideological revolution of the literary and art team. Only in this way can revolutionary literature and art become a powerful weapon against the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of the spread of revisionism, and only in this way can they undertake the heavy responsibility of defending the great proletarian dictatorship and defending the great cause of socialism.

To occupy the ideological and cultural front, the proletariat must mobilize hundreds of millions of people to launch a revolutionary great criticism and great struggle. The current revolutionary great criticism and great struggle must direct their spearhead at the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. The "Summary of the Symposium" points out: "We must, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, resolutely carry out a socialist cultural revolution on the cultural front," and take the ideological and cultural front "comprehensively and systematically." We must dare to criticize all old thoughts and old cultures, and dare to criticize corrupt "great figures" and reactionary bourgeois "authorities." Without criticism and elimination, new proletarian thoughts and cultures cannot survive and develop. The current battle task before us is to carry out this great criticism and great struggle more deeply and at a higher level, push this great criticism and great struggle to a new high tide, and combine it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our own units.

We must also recognize that to solve the problem of who wins and who loses in the ideological and cultural realm, it is not something that can be achieved with one or two, three or four cultural revolutions. The "Summary of the Symposium" points out to us with a thorough spirit of dialectical materialism and revolution: "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to struggle again. Therefore, this is a protracted, complex, and arduous struggle that will require decades or even centuries of effort. This is a major issue concerning the future of our country's revolution, and it is also a major issue concerning the future of the world revolution."

This is a great call. We must resolutely respond to this call and unswervingly carry the proletarian revolution in the ideological and cultural realm through to the end!

    无产阶级文化革命的重要文件
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在去年三月，亲自修改和批示了《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》。这个座谈会，是我国文化斗争史上非常重要的一次会议。这个《座谈会纪要》，是我国无产阶级文化革命的一个极其重要的文件。
    当时，正处在国内两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的严重时刻。在思想文化领域，这个斗争表现得特别集中、特别尖锐、特别激烈。在林彪同志的支持和帮助下，江青同志带领解放军的革命文化工作者，冲破重重阻力，同反革命的《二月提纲》针锋相对，发出了部队文艺工作《座谈会纪要》，向反革命修正主义路线发动了猛攻。
    《座谈会纪要》用光焰无际的毛泽东思想，回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题。《座谈会纪要》坚持和保卫了毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方向，具体地阐明了无产阶级专政的整个历史时期文艺在复辟和反复辟斗争中的重大作用，有力地打击了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所支持的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。《座谈会纪要》是活学活用毛泽东思想的光辉典范，是创造无产阶级新文艺斗争经验的科学总结。《座谈会纪要》是讨伐反革命修正主义文艺黑线的檄文，是捍卫毛主席革命文艺路线的宣言书。它不仅具有极大的现实意义，而且具有深远的历史意义。
    毛主席教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”在社会主义革命时期，文艺为工农兵服务，为无产阶级政治服务，就是要为巩固无产阶级专政、发展社会主义革命服务，就是要用无产阶级面貌改造党，改造世界。革命或反革命的阶级要夺取政权，总是首先争夺文艺这个先头阵地。无产阶级同资产阶级的政治斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，也总是首先从文艺上反映出来。在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期中，阶级斗争的主要内容，就是复辟和反复辟、夺权和反夺权的斗争。被打倒了的阶级敌人，总是利用文艺这个重要的工具，为他们复辟资本主义制造舆论；企图用资产阶级面貌改造党，改造世界，梦想变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，千万不要忘记阶级斗争，尤其不能忽视包括文艺在内的思想文化领域里的阶级斗争。
    《座谈会纪要》遵循毛主席关于社会主义时期阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，对解放以来文艺战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争形势，作了全面的、深刻的、正确的分析，挖出了一条与毛泽东思想相对立的反党反社会主义的文艺黑线。这条黑线，就是资产阶级的文艺思想、现代修正主义的文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺的结合。这条文艺黑线，是为党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派所坚持的反革命修正主义的政治路线服务的。十多年来，以彭真、陆定一、周扬、夏衍为代表的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，在他们的总后台、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，打着“红旗”反红旗，招降纳叛，结党营私，阳奉阴违，横行霸道，在文艺界专了我们的政，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派实现篡党、篡军、篡政的阴谋作舆论准备。《座谈会纪要》高举革命的批判的旗帜，向为复辟资本主义服务的文艺黑线及其总后台，发动了猛烈的反击，打胜了头一仗。
    《座谈会纪要》强调指出：“我们的文艺是无产阶级的文艺，是党的文艺。无产阶级的党性原则是我们区别于其他阶级的最显著标志。须知其他阶级的代表人物也是有他们的党性原则的，并且很顽强。不论是创作思想方面，组织路线方面，工作作风方面，都要坚持无产阶级的党性原则，反对资产阶级思想的侵蚀。同资产阶级思想必须划清界线，决不能和平共处。”无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。无产阶级和资产阶级的斗争，它们在意识形态领域里的斗争，正如两军对战，总是一胜一败。不是你吃掉我，就是我吃掉你。不是我们消灭他们，就是他们消灭我们。思想文化领域内的战争是不能停火的，决不能搞和平共处。如果谁同资产阶级思想、文化去和平共处，就只能是向资产阶级思想、文化投降。
    林彪同志说：“文艺这个阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领，斗争是不可避免的。这是在意识形态领域里极为广泛、深刻的社会主义革命，搞不好就会出修正主义。”第一个社会主义国家苏联，就是因为放弃了意识形态领域里的阶级斗争，被修正主义集团篡夺了党和国家的领导，实行了资本主义复辟。在其他的一些社会主义国家里，也发生了同样的事情。我们必须牢牢地记取这个国际无产阶级专政历史的严重教训。
    革命的文艺一定要成为巩固无产阶级专政的强大工具，“使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
    《座谈会纪要》在大破为反革命修正主义政治路线服务的文艺黑线的同时，也总结了大立无产阶级新文艺的宝贵经验。《座谈会纪要》强调指出，我们必须坚决执行毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方向；贯彻群众路线，抓好创作；采取革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，满腔热情地、千方百计地去塑造工农兵的英雄形象；努力反映广大工农兵在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的斗争生活；大力提倡革命的战斗的群众性的文艺批评，把文艺批评的武器交给广大工农兵群众去掌握。为了繁荣社会主义的新文艺，推动无产阶级革命文艺运动的蓬勃发展，我们必须把活学活用毛主席著作放到高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的位置上，必须长期深入斗争生活，和工农兵相结合，彻底改造世界观，加速文艺队伍的思想革命化。只有这样，革命的文艺才能成为反对资本主义复辟、防止修正主义泛滥的有力武器，才能担负起保卫伟大的无产阶级专政，保卫伟大的社会主义事业的重任。
    无产阶级要占领思想文化阵地，就必须发动亿万群众，开展一场革命的大批判，大斗争。当前开展的革命的大批判，大斗争，必须把矛头指向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子。《座谈会纪要》指出：“我们一定要根据党中央的指示，坚决进行一场文化战线上的社会主义大革命”，把思想文化阵地“全盘的系统的抓起来”。我们要敢于批判一切旧思想、旧文化，敢于批判腐朽的“大人物”和反动的资产阶级“权威”。不批判、不破除它们，无产阶级的新思想、新文化就无从生存、无从发展。当前，摆在我们面前的战斗任务，就是要更加深入地、更高水平地进行这场大批判、大斗争，把这场大批判、大斗争推向一个新的高潮，并且和本单位的斗批改结合起来。
    我们还应当认识到，要解决在思想文化领域里谁胜谁负的问题，决不是一二次、三四次文化大革命就能办到的。《座谈会纪要》以彻底的辩证唯物主义的革命精神向我们指出：“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。所以，这是一场艰巨、复杂、长期的斗争，要经过几十年甚至几百年的努力。这是关系到我国革命前途的大事，也是关系到世界革命前途的大事。”
    这是一个伟大的号召。我们一定要坚决响应这个号召，坚定不移地把思想文化领域的无产阶级革命进行到底！
