Guizhou's summer grain crops have begun to be harvested with sickles. The Cultural Revolution has promoted the ideological revolution of the people and driven production. The total yield of summer grain crops in the province is expected to see a significant increase compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 12 — Guizhou Province's summer grain crops have successively ripened, and the earlier season in the southern regions has already begun harvesting with sickles. The summer grain crops in the entire province have grown well, and it is estimated that the total yield will see a significant increase compared to last year.

Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants, militia, and revolutionary cadres in various parts of Guizhou Province are following Chairman Mao's great directive to "grasp revolution and promote production." They are carrying out a mass movement to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Under the premise of focusing on the revolution, they are rallying all their strength to fight the summer harvest battle, striving for a bumper harvest, and ensuring that every grain is stored. Wherever the harvest begins, reports of significant increases in production are heard. The reporter, in the wheat fields of the First Production Team of Lianjiang Brigade, Chitu Commune, Huishui County, saw wheat as tall as the waist, with long ears full of grains, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest.

Guizhou's significant increase in summer grain production is a brilliant victory of Mao Zedong Thought guiding production and the result of the ideological revolution of the people in the rural cultural revolution. Last autumn, under the impetus of the new situation of the national cultural revolution, revolutionary cadres and community members enthusiastically responded to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to push the study and application of Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. A new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works swept through the rural areas of the entire province, promoting ideological revolution. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," grasped the revolution, and vigorously promoted production. The community members broke away from the long-standing one-sided view of prioritizing autumn grain over summer grain and firmly took the path of double-cropping rice and wheat in grain production. Various places also started from the actual situation at that time and place, expanded the planting area of summer grain crops, making the wheat planting area in the entire province nearly double that of the previous year. The planting areas of barley, peas, and broad beans also increased by more than one-third. During the planting, due to the revolutionary cadres and masses establishing the idea of farming for the revolution and scientific farming, the planting quality this autumn was significantly better than in previous years.

In late January of this year, in the dead of winter, the thunder of the southwest rang out. The revolutionary masses of Guizhou Province united and seized the party, government, financial, and cultural powers from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the provincial party committee. After the publication of the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes Across the Country," the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres was further aroused. Under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, they enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and strengthened the field management of summer crops. In the face of severe spring drought, some production teams had yellowing wheat seedlings. Facing this difficulty, the community members repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and insisted on carrying water to irrigate the wheat. Some production teams had wheat seedlings damaged by hail, but the community members remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "firmly making up one's mind, not fearing sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory." After the hail, they immediately straightened the wheat seedlings and added soil and fertilizer.

In the days of welcoming the summer grain harvest, the various ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants in Guizhou never forget the deep friendship of the Albanian people across thousands of mountains and rivers. Ten years ago, the heroic class brothers of Albania sent carefully cultivated wheat seeds to the Guizhou mountains. After ten years, these two types of wheat have become the main varieties in Guizhou and are highly welcomed by the various ethnic community members.

The various ethnic community members in Guizhou, while harvesting, do not forget to be thrifty, and while increasing production, do not forget the state. They carefully plan and save grain, store grain for emergencies, and are prepared to hand over more grain to the state to support the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    贵州夏粮作物开镰收割
    文化大革命促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产。全省夏粮作物生长很好，总产量将比去年有大幅度增长
    新华社贵阳十二日电　贵州省夏粮作物相继黄熟，季节较早的南部地区已开镰收割。全省夏粮作物生长很好，预计总产量将比去年有大幅度增长。
    目前，贵州省各地贫下中农、民兵和广大革命干部，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，正开展群众性的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判运动，在狠抓革命的前提下，鼓足革命干劲，集中一切力量，打好夏收这一仗，力争丰产丰收，颗粒归仓。全省各地哪里开始收割，哪里就传出大幅度增产的捷报。记者在惠水县赤土公社涟江大队第一生产队的麦地里，只见齐腰高的小麦一片金黄，长长的麦穗籽粒饱满，呈现出一片大丰收的景象。
    贵州夏粮大幅度增产，是毛泽东思想统帅生产的光辉胜利，是农村无产阶级文化大革命促进了人的思想革命化的结果。去年秋季，在全国无产阶级文化大革命新形势的推动下，广大革命干部和社员热烈响应林彪副主席把活学活用毛主席著作推向新阶段的号召，在全省农村掀起了大学毛主席著作的新高潮，促进了思想的革命化。他们坚决贯彻执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，狠抓革命，猛促生产。社员们打破了长时期以来重秋粮、轻夏粮的片面观点，在发展粮食生产上坚决走稻麦两熟的道路。各地还从当时当地的实际情况出发，扩种夏粮作物，使全省小麦播种面积比上年扩大近一倍，大麦、豌豆、蚕豆的播种面积也扩大了三分之一以上。在播种中，由于广大革命干部和革命群众树立了为革命种田和科学种田的思想，秋种质量比往年有很大提高。
    今年一月下旬，在隆冬季节里响起了西南的春雷，贵州省无产阶级革命派联合起来，从省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回了被他们窃取的党、政、财、文大权。《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》发表以后，更加调动了广大贫下中农和基层干部的革命积极性。他们在省革命委员会的领导下，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，活学活用毛主席著作，加强了对夏收作物的田间管理。在严重的春旱中，有的生产队麦苗枯黄。面临这个困难，社员们反复学习《愚公移山》，坚持挑水浇麦。有的生产队麦苗遭到冰雹，但是社员们牢记毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，冰雹过后，马上就把麦苗扶起，壅土追肥。
    在迎接夏粮丰收的日子里，贵州各族贫下中农念念不忘相隔万水千山的阿尔巴尼亚人民的深厚友谊。十年前，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚的阶级兄弟，把精心培育出的小麦良种送来贵州山区。经过十年的时间，这两种小麦已经成为贵州的主要品种，备受各族社员的欢迎。
    贵州各族社员丰收不忘节约，增产不忘国家，他们精打细算，节约用粮，储粮备荒，准备把更多的粮食交售给国家，支援社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。
