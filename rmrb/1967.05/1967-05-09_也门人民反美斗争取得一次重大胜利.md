Chairman Mao said: "American imperialism is rampant everywhere, placing itself in a position of enmity with all the peoples of the world, making itself increasingly isolated."

The Yemeni people have achieved a major victory in their anti-American struggle. The American threat has failed, and more than a hundred American spies have been forced to withdraw from Yemen.

Report from our correspondent: Under the strong counterattack of the Yemeni people and the orders of the government of the Arab Republic of Yemen, the U.S. government has been forced to withdraw 124 American personnel from its spy agency, the "International Development Agency," from Yemen. This is a major victory for the Arab people's anti-American struggle and another major exposure and failure of American imperialism's subversive and aggressive plots in Arab countries.

On April 25 of this year, two American personnel from the so-called "Fourth Point Plan" office of the U.S. "International Development Agency," which has long been engaged in subversive and destructive activities in Yemen, actually fired a rocket launcher at the Yemeni military arsenal in Taiz, injuring many Yemenis.

This crime aroused the extreme indignation of the Yemeni people, who immediately launched an unprecedented anti-American wave. On the 26th, 5,000 Yemenis took to the streets in protest marches, destroying this American spy agency. Subsequently, strikes, class boycotts, and market closures were held. On May 1st, International Labor Day, 1,000 Yemeni workers held another anti-American protest march.

At the same time, the Yemeni government arrested these two American criminals and immediately searched and found hidden rocket launcher shells and other weapons, as well as secret wireless communication equipment. The Yemeni government also made three serious decisions regarding this matter: American "International Development Agency" personnel must immediately leave Yemen; the agreement between Yemen and this American agency is abolished, and the permission for this American agency's aircraft to fly in Yemen is canceled; the American personnel engaged in espionage activities are handed over to the Yemeni judicial authorities for handling. These three decisions have now been implemented.

The American imperialists have made various unreasonable threats and counterattacks against the Yemeni people and government's just actions. On the morning of April 27, the American chargé d'affaires in Yemen arrogantly presented a "final oral ultimatum" to the Yemeni government, demanding that the Yemeni government release the arrested American criminals within 24 hours and "compensate" for the losses of the American spy agency, otherwise the U.S. government would "withdraw" its "recognition" of the Arab Republic of Yemen. However, under the strong anti-American wave of the broad masses of the Yemeni people and the stern rebuke of the Yemeni government, six 24-hour periods later, it was the same American chargé d'affaires who had to personally go to the Yemeni Foreign Ministry to withdraw his "final ultimatum."

The other two American threats: withdrawing aid to Yemen and restricting the freedom of movement of the Yemeni ambassador to the United States, have also failed.

American imperialism has thus exposed its weak and hollow nature in front of the Yemeni people and the people of the world. The struggle of the Yemeni people has proven that American imperialism is a bully, and as long as the broad masses unite and dare to struggle, they can completely frustrate all its plots and tricks.

### 也门人民反美斗争取得一次重大胜利

    毛主席说：“美帝国主义到处横行霸道，把它自己放在同全世界人民为敌的地位，使它自己越来越陷于孤立。”
    也门人民反美斗争取得一次重大胜利
    美帝威胁遭到失败，被迫从也门撤出一百多间谍人员
    本报综合报道　在也门人民的迎头痛击和阿拉伯也门共和国政府的限令之下，美国政府已被迫把它在也门的间谍机构“国际开发署”的一百二十四个美国人灰溜溜地从也门撤走。这是阿拉伯人民反美斗争的一次重大胜利，也是美帝国主义在阿拉伯国家进行颠覆侵略阴谋的又一次大暴露，大失败。
    今年四月二十五日，一贯进行颠覆破坏活动的美国“国际开发署”在也门的机构——所谓“第四点计划”办事处的两名美国人员，竟然用火箭筒轰击也门塔伊兹军火库，打伤多名也门人。
    这个罪行激起了也门人民的无比愤怒，他们立即掀起了空前规模的反美怒潮。二十六日，五千也门人上街示威游行，捣毁了这个美国的间谍机构。随后举行了罢工、罢课和罢市。“五一”国际劳动节，一千名也门工人又举行了反美示威游行。
    与此同时，也门政府也逮捕了这两个美国罪犯，并当场搜出私藏的火箭筒弹和其他武器以及秘密无线电收发报机。也门政府并为这件事作出三项严正决定，即美国“国际开发署”的工作人员必须立即离开也门；废除也门和这个美国机构签订的协定，取消给予这个美国机构的飞机在也门境内飞行的许可；把进行间谍活动的美国人员交给也门司法当局处理。这三项决定，现在已经实现。
    对于也门人民和政府的这种正义行动，美帝国主义曾经进行种种无理的恫吓和反扑。四月二十七日上午，美国驻也门代办气势汹汹地向也门政府提出了“最后口头通牒”，要也门政府答应在二十四小时内释放被捕的美国罪犯，“赔偿”美国间谍机构的损失，否则美国政府将“撤销”它对阿拉伯也门共和国的“承认”。可是，在也门广大人民掀起强大反美浪潮的反击下和也门政府的严词斥责下，在六个二十四小时之后，同样是这个美国代办不得不亲自前往也门外交部收回他的“最后通牒”。
    美国政府的另外两点恫吓：撤销对也门的“援助”；限制也门驻美大使的行动自由，也先后破产了。
    美帝国主义就这样在也门人民面前，在全世界人民面前暴露了它外强中干的虚弱本质。也门人民的斗争证明，美帝国主义是欺软怕硬的，只要广大人民团结起来，敢于斗争，完全可以挫败它的一切阴谋诡计。（据新华社）
