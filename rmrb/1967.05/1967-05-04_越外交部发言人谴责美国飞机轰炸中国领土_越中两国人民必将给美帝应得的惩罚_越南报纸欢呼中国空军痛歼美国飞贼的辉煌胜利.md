Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Condemns U.S. Aircraft Bombing of Chinese Territory

The peoples of Vietnam and China will surely give the U.S. imperialists the punishment they deserve

Vietnamese Newspapers Celebrate the Glorious Victory of the Chinese Air Force in Annihilating U.S. Bandits

New China News Agency, Hanoi, May 3rd

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialists' war provocation of dispatching aircraft to bomb Chinese territory. The full text of the statement is as follows:

After repeatedly violating the airspace of the People's Republic of China, U.S. imperialism once again dispatched four fighter jets to bomb the southern region of Ningming County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on May 2, 1967, causing damage to the property of the local people.

This is an extremely blatant act of war provocation by U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China.

At a time when U.S. imperialism is striving to intensify and expand its war of aggression against Vietnam, this action further escalates the tension in Asia and will surely be severely condemned by world opinion.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully supports the solemn position and powerful warning of the Government of the People's Republic of China as stated in the statement issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense of China on May 2, 1967.

The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely condemns all acts of war provocation by U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China.

U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of Vietnam and China. If U.S. imperialism deliberately expands the war, then the peoples of Vietnam and China, who are already closely united, will be even more closely united and will give it the punishment it deserves.

According to the New China News Agency, Hanoi, May 3rd, the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army" published an article titled "The Chinese People's Air Force Fights Well" on May 3rd, enthusiastically celebrating the glorious victories achieved by the air force units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in recent days, shooting down five invading U.S. bandit aircraft in three consecutive battles.

The article says that recently, while U.S. imperialism has been escalating its war against North Vietnam, it has also continuously dispatched military aircraft to illegally violate Chinese airspace. In both Vietnam and China, the U.S. bandits have received the punishment they deserve.

The article points out that the glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are an excellent coordination with the anti-U.S. struggle of the military and people of both North and South Vietnam. The armed forces of the Vietnamese people extend warm fraternal combat greetings to the Chinese People's Liberation Army, especially to the air force fighters.

    越外交部发言人谴责美国飞机轰炸中国领土
    越中两国人民必将给美帝应得的惩罚
    越南报纸欢呼中国空军痛歼美国飞贼的辉煌胜利
    新华社河内三日电  越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义派遣飞机轰炸中国领土的战争挑衅行动。声明全文如下：
    美帝国主义在多次侵犯中华人民共和国领空以后，一九六七年五月二日又派遣战斗机四架轰炸了广西壮族自治区宁明县南部地区，造成当地人民财产的损失。
    这是美帝国主义对中华人民共和国进行的一次极其明目张胆的战争挑衅行动。
    在美帝国主义竭力强化和扩大侵略越南战争的时候，它的这一行动进一步加剧了亚洲的紧张局势，必将受到世界舆论的严厉谴责。
    越南民主共和国政府完全支持中国国防部发言人一九六七年五月二日声明中所阐明和提出的中华人民共和国政府的严正立场和强有力的警告。
    越南民主共和国政府坚决谴责美帝国主义对中华人民共和国进行的一切战争挑衅行动。
    美帝国主义是越南人民和中国人民的共同的敌人。如果美帝国主义蓄意扩大战争，那末，已经紧密团结的越南人民和中国人民将更加紧密团结起来，并将给它以应得的惩罚。
    据新华社河内三日电越南《人民军队报》三日发表一篇题为《中国人民空军打得真好》的评论，热烈欢呼中国人民解放军空军部队连日来三战三捷，击落入侵美国强盗飞机五架的辉煌胜利。
    评论说，最近，美帝国主义在变本加厉地对越南北方进行战争“升级”的同时，还连续派遣军用飞机非法侵犯中国领空。在越南和中国，美国强盗都遭到了应得的惩罚。
    评论指出，中国人民解放军接连取得的辉煌战功，是对越南南北两方军民的抗美斗争的绝妙配合。越南人民武装力量向中国人民解放军，特别是向空军战士们，致以热烈的兄弟的战斗祝贺。
