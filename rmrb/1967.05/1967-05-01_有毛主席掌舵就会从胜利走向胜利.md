The broad masses of revolutionary people in Harbin, Zhengzhou, and Lhasa watched the large-scale color documentary film "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" with great excitement and were greatly inspired. They expressed their determination to always be loyal to Chairman Mao and to the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, to firmly hold high the revolutionary banner of criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and to resolutely criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Workers from the Harbin Forestry Machinery Factory said excitedly after watching the film, "Chairman Mao is our trusted leader. With Chairman Mao at the helm, we will overcome all obstacles on the road ahead and advance from one victory to another." The poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Harbin City said excitedly after watching the film, "The screening of this documentary film of great historical significance has greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and crushed the reactionary arrogance of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and all the ghosts and snakes in society. It is truly wonderful!" They said, "Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud. We must grasp the revolution and promote production vigorously and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

The young Red Guards who went to Beijing to be inspected by Chairman Mao on National Day last year were particularly excited after watching the film. They said, "We will forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution. We fear neither the knife mountain nor the fire sea. Our hearts will not change even if the sea dries up and the stones rot. We will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, advance victoriously, defend the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' policy, and resolutely criticize and expose the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, completing the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation assigned to us by Chairman Mao."

Today, 700,000 people in Zhengzhou watched the film. Revolutionary workers said excitedly, "Chairman Mao is in such good health, which is the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world. Chairman Mao cares most about the masses, believes in the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary initiative of the masses the most. Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours." They said, "We will definitely hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the revolution, and promote production vigorously. Revolutionary peasants in the suburbs said after watching the film, 'Chairman Mao cares most about us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most. We will never allow the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road to succeed in his plot to restore capitalism. We will definitely advance victoriously along the course charted by Chairman Mao, achieve a double harvest in revolution and production, and respond to Chairman Mao's concern for us with practical actions."

When the film was shown in Lhasa on the Tibetan Plateau, as soon as the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, appeared on the screen full of vigor, the audience immediately erupted in thunderous cheers and applause. Many people were so excited that they shed tears and repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" Revolutionary masses expressed their determination to thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in various fields and to advance victoriously along the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao forever.
