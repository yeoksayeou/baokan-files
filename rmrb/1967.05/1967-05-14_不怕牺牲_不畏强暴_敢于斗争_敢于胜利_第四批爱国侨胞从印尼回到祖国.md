The fourth batch of 1,099 Indonesian victims of persecution who returned to the motherland aboard the Guanghua ship arrived at Huangpu Port in Guangzhou this morning. Several thousand revolutionary rebels and people from all walks of life in Guangzhou gathered at the port to warmly welcome these patriotic overseas Chinese who, under the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, fearlessly sacrificed themselves, dared to struggle, and dared to win, returning to the embrace of their motherland.

Today, Huangpu Port was adorned with red flags and filled with revolutionary songs, creating a festive atmosphere. The welcoming team, composed of revolutionary masses, workers, peasants, students, Red Guards, government officials, and returned overseas Chinese from Guangzhou, arrived at dawn, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations, waving red flags, and beating drums and gongs from all directions.

Around 6 AM, as the Guanghua ship slowly docked, the revolutionary masses on the pier sang "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," and shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" At this moment, the returned refugees on the deck and along the ship's railings waved their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and held up portraits of Chairman Mao, repeatedly shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and waving to their compatriots on the pier, expressing their boundless respect for the great leader Chairman Mao and their boundless love for the great socialist motherland.

Amidst the enthusiastic cheers of "Welcome, refugees!" the refugees disembarked. On November 9 last year, Tang Xiu Lian, a female teacher who participated in the struggle against the right-wing thugs at the Indonesian Chinese School in Medan, and Qu Dongmei, a female student, led the way, holding high a red flag embroidered with "Long live Chairman Mao." This flag was specially embroidered by the female youths at the Medan refugee camp when they heard that the Guanghua ship would send people to visit the refugees. When entrusting the Guanghua ship's refugee reception team to bring the flag back to the country, they carefully embroidered two lines on it: "Dedicated to the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao" and "All the persecuted overseas Chinese in Aceh at the Medan refugee camp." When Tang Xiu Lian and Qu Dongmei held up this flag and walked through the welcoming crowd, people expressed their high respect for the overseas Chinese who love socialism and Chairman Mao with thunderous applause and slogans.

Next, a propaganda team composed of refugee youths descended the ship. Each of them held up portraits of Chairman Mao, copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and slogans such as "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life," shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!" and singing songs from Chairman Mao's quotations, spirits soaring, heads held high, and chests puffed out, walking through the crowd that lined the path. These refugee youths, having studied Chairman Mao's works, held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely fought back against the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, achieving victory after victory. After disembarking, refugee youths Liu Yuzhen, Luo Yueming, and Li Manjin immediately shared their experiences of fighting against persecution at the Danan Xili refugee camp in Indonesia with revolutionary rebel students from Jinan University. They excitedly said to the revolutionary rebel students: During our struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries, the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought gave us infinite wisdom and strength. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland and the immortal deeds of the revolutionary rebels in the Cultural Revolution greatly encouraged our courage to fight to the end against the Indonesian reactionaries. They expressed that after returning to the motherland, they would definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, learn the fearless revolutionary and rebellious spirit of the revolutionary rebels and Red Guards, and fight to the end against domestic and foreign reactionaries.

This batch of returning refugees had been severely persecuted by the Indonesian reactionaries for a long time, with their health seriously damaged. Many were seriously ill, many elderly people were very weak, and many had been tortured to the point of difficulty in walking. When medical staff and crew members carried them off the ship on stretchers, it aroused the intense hatred of the revolutionary rebels and Red Guards in Guangzhou against the Indonesian reactionaries, and the slogan "Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" echoed continuously.

On the pier square, a welcoming rally was held. At the beginning of the rally, the returning refugees and the revolutionary masses who came to welcome them first paid tribute to our great leader Chairman Mao, wishing the reddest sun in our hearts and the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao eternal life! Wishing our great leader's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, good health!

The responsible person from the Guangdong Provincial Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the representative of the Guangzhou revolutionary rebels spoke at the meeting, extending the warmest welcome to the returning refugees. They pointed out that the returning refugees, in the face of unprecedented barbaric and cruel persecution by the Indonesian reactionaries, fearlessly sacrificed themselves, were not tempted by personal gain, and resolutely defended the dignity of our great motherland. This greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people and crushed the arrogance of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and the Indonesian reactionaries. These refugees are truly good overseas Chinese of the great socialist motherland led by Chairman Mao and good sons and daughters of the great Chinese nation. They strongly protested against the Indonesian reactionaries' crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese policies and warned the Suharto-Nasution reactionary clique: Your crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese policies will not end well, and the blood debt you owe will definitely be repaid. They also introduced the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland to the returning refugees. They said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is now at a critical moment of decisive battle. We warmly welcome you to quickly join the great tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and fight shoulder to shoulder with us to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After a short rest at Huangpu Port, the returning refugees boarded a train to their temporary residence in Foshan. At Foshan Station, the returning refugees were warmly welcomed by more than a thousand revolutionary masses from all walks of life in Foshan.

    不怕牺牲　不畏强暴　敢于斗争　敢于胜利
    第四批爱国侨胞从印尼回到祖国
    新华社广州十三日电  第四批乘光华轮归国的一千零九十九名印度尼西亚受害华侨，今天早晨抵达广州市黄埔港。广州市的革命造反派和各界革命群众数千人齐集港口码头，热烈欢迎这批高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，面对着印尼反动派残酷的迫害，不怕牺牲，不畏强暴，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的爱国华侨回到祖国的怀抱。
    今天的黄埔港，红旗招展，革命歌声嘹亮，一片欢腾。由广州市各界革命群众、工人、农民、学生、红卫兵小将、机关干部和归国华侨组成的欢迎队伍，今天拂晓就高举着毛主席画像和语录牌，打着红旗，敲锣打鼓，从四面八方涌到港口码头。
    上午六时许，当光华轮缓缓靠岸时，码头上的革命群众高唱着《东方红》和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌曲；“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”、“打倒印尼反动派！”、“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”的口号声响彻云霄。这时，聚集在甲板上、船舷旁的归国难侨们，挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》本和高举着毛主席画像，不停地高呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”频频向码头上的祖国亲人招手，表达他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限崇敬和对伟大社会主义祖国的无限热爱。
    在“难侨们，欢迎您！”的热烈欢呼声中，难侨们登岸了。去年十一月九日在棉兰华侨中学难侨收容所参加过抗击印尼右派暴徒斗争的难侨女教师谭秀莲和难侨女学生邱东梅，高举着一面绣有“毛主席万岁”字样的红旗，走在前面。这面红旗是棉兰难侨收容所的女青年在听到光华轮接侨人员要去探望难侨时特别赶绣的。在委托光华轮接侨工作组带这面红旗回国时，她们又在上面细心地绣上两行字：“献给我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席”“全体亚齐受迫害华侨于印尼棉兰收容所”。当谭秀莲和邱东梅高举着这面红旗穿过欢迎队伍时，人们用春雷般的掌声和口号声，向对社会主义祖国、对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的海外华侨表示崇高的敬意。
    接着，一支由难侨青少年组成的毛泽东思想宣传队走下船梯。他们人人高举着毛主席像、《毛主席语录》本和“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”等标语牌、语录牌，高呼“毛主席万岁！”高唱毛主席语录歌，精神抖擞，昂首挺胸，在夹道欢迎的人群中穿过。这些难侨青少年由于学习了毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在印尼反动派的迫害面前，坚决地进行了针锋相对的斗争，并且取得了一次又一次的胜利。难侨女青年刘玉珍、罗月明和李满金登岸后，便向前来欢迎的暨南大学革命造反派学生畅谈他们在印尼丹南希利难侨“收容所”里进行反迫害斗争的经历。她们在和革命造反派学生交谈时兴奋地说：在我们同印尼反动派斗争时，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了我们无穷的智慧和力量。祖国开展的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，革命小将在文化大革命中立下的不朽功勋，都大大地鼓舞了我们同印尼反动派斗争到底的勇气。他们表示回到祖国以后，一定要更好地学习毛主席著作，学习革命造反派和红卫兵小将们敢于革命、敢于造反的大无畏精神，和国内外反动派斗争到底。
    这批回国的难侨由于受到印尼反动派长期残酷迫害，健康受到严重摧残。不少人身患重病，许多老人体质非常衰弱，还有不少人已经被折磨得步履艰难。当医务人员和船员用担架把他们抬下船时，激起广州市革命造反派和红卫兵小将们对印尼反动派的切齿痛恨，“打倒印尼反动派！”的口号声接连不断。
    在码头广场上，举行了欢迎集会，集会开始时，归国难侨和前来欢迎的广大革命群众首先向我们伟大的领袖毛主席致敬，齐声祝愿我们心中最红最红的红太阳、最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！祝愿我们伟大领袖的亲密战友林彪副主席身体健康！
    中国人民解放军广东省军区负责人、广州市革命造反派的代表先后在会上讲话，对归国难侨表示最热烈的欢迎。他们指出，归国难侨面对着印尼反动派空前野蛮残酷的迫害，不怕牺牲，不为利诱，坚决维护我们伟大祖国的尊严，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了美帝、苏修和印尼反动派的威风，这些难侨不愧是毛主席领导的伟大社会主义祖国的好侨胞，不愧为伟大中华民族的好儿女。他们强烈抗议印尼反动派疯狂反华排华，并且警告苏哈托—纳苏蒂安反动派说：你们疯狂反华排华是没有好下场的，你们欠下的血债一定要偿还。他们还向归国难侨介绍了祖国的无产阶级文化大革命情况。他们说：目前无产阶级文化大革命正处在大决战的关键时刻，我们热烈地欢迎你们迅速投入伟大的无产阶级文化大革命的洪流中，和我们并肩战斗，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    归国难侨们在黄埔港稍事休息后，即乘火车前往佛山市的临时住地。在佛山车站，归国难侨受到佛山市各界革命群众一千多人的热烈欢迎。
