Albanian and Asian Newspapers Hail Chinese Air Force's Three Victories in Three Battles

The U.S. Imperialists Dare to Invade China, They Will Dig Their Own Graves

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 7th: The Albanian newspaper "Warrior" published a commentary on May 7th, enthusiastically hailing the Chinese People's Liberation Army Air Force's downing of five U.S. aggressor planes in eight days, achieving three victories in three battles.

The commentary pointed out that the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is a contribution to the anti-U.S. struggle of revolutionary people of all countries, and is a direct support to the sacred anti-U.S. war of the Vietnamese people in the North and South.

The commentary pointed out that while the U.S. imperialists are escalating their unprecedentedly savage war against the heroic Vietnamese people, they are constantly provoking the People's Republic of China. This is part of their global strategy, which is strongly supported by the Khrushchev revisionists. People's China is a thorn in the eye of U.S. imperialism and its allies, and an insurmountable obstacle to the realization of their global strategy.

The commentary pointed out that the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and their brave army, are always ready to smash any provocation from the enemy and bury all invaders.

According to Xinhua News Agency, May 7th: Recent statements by newspapers in Burma, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Syria have strongly condemned the U.S. aggressors for repeatedly sending planes to violate Chinese airspace, and pointed out that the Chinese people will continue to give a heavy blow to the aggressors.

The Burmese newspaper "People's Daily" published an article by Duama on May 6th, stating that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is fully prepared to smash any enemy that dares to invade China. The article pointed out that this is why the U.S. aggressor planes that violated Chinese airspace were shot down.

The article pointed out that the U.S. imperialists, having launched an invasion of Vietnam, have fallen into endless trouble. They will face a disaster many times more serious. China has not provoked the United States. If the United States deliberately imposes a war on China, it will dig its own grave.

The Cambodian newspaper "Motherland" published a commentary on May 5th, stating that the U.S. imperialists' aggression against China can only be seen as a moth flying into the flame to self-destruct. The commentary emphasized that it can be predicted that if the U.S. imperialists dare to attack People's China, they will surely accelerate their own demise.

The Pakistani newspaper "Today" published an editorial on May 5th, stating that the Chinese people know how to defend their country's independence and integrity. The editorial warned that U.S. imperialism will be badly hurt in the face of the Chinese people's iron will.

The Syrian newspaper "Revolution" published a commentary on May 6th, stating that if the United States imposes a war on China, China will accept this challenge. The Chinese people have always regarded U.S. imperialism as a paper tiger.

    评论指出，美帝国主义在对英雄的越南人民进行空前野蛮的战争“升级”的同时，不断对中华人民共和国进行公开挑衅，这是它的全球战略的组成部分，是得到赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的大力支持的。人民中国是美帝国主义及其同盟者的眼中钉，是实现它的全球战略的不可逾越的障碍。
    评论指出，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民及其英勇的军队，正时刻准备着粉碎任何敌人的挑衅，埋葬一切来犯者。

    文章指出，美帝国主义由于发动对越南的侵略已经陷入无尽头的麻烦，它将面临严重许多倍的灾祸。中国没有对美国挑衅。如果美国蓄意把战争强加于中国，它将自掘坟墓。
    柬埔寨《祖国报》五日发表的评论指出，人们只能把美帝国主义对中国的侵略，看作是飞蛾扑火自焚。评论强调说，人们可以预料到，如果美帝国主义胆敢进攻人民中国，那么，它肯定将加速自己的灭亡。
    巴基斯坦《今天报》五日发表社论说，中国人民知道怎样保卫他们国家的独立和完整。社论警告说，美帝国主义在中国人民的钢铁意志面前要碰得头破血流。
    叙利亚《革命报》六日发表评论说，如果美国把战争强加给中国，中国将接受这种挑战，中国人民一直把美帝国主义看成是纸老虎。
