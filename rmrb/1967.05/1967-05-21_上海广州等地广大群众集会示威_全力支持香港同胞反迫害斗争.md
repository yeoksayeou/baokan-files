Masses in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Other Cities Hold Rallies and Protests to Fully Support Hong Kong Compatriots in Their Struggle Against Oppression

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 19th, the masses in cities such as Shanghai, Harbin, Guiyang, and Lhasa have held large-scale rallies and protests in recent days to strongly condemn the fascist atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong and to resolutely support the just struggle of our Hong Kong compatriots against oppression.

In Shanghai, the anti-imperialist wave has been surging in recent days, with hundreds of thousands of revolutionary masses taking to the streets to hold grand protests. This afternoon, 80,000 revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers and officers, Red Guards, revolutionary students and teachers, and revolutionary cadres braved the rain to gather at People's Square. They angrily denounced the fascist atrocities committed by the British authorities in Hong Kong in suppressing Hong Kong patriots and resolutely supported the solemn statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They fully expressed the determination of the 10 million Shanghai people to unite against the enemy. The rally was attended by Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, as well as foreign friends and students visiting Shanghai.

The 14th delegation of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), which is visiting Shanghai, read out a statement at the rally supporting the Chinese people's struggle against British imperialism's fascist atrocities in Hong Kong, expressing resolute support for the heroic struggle of the Chinese people.

The rally read out a message of condolence to Hong Kong patriots. After the rally, the revolutionary masses braved the rain to hold a protest march.

The revolutionary masses in Harbin, the mountainous city of Guiyang, and the high-altitude city of Lhasa also held rallies and protest marches, expressing the strongest support for the statement issued by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the most resolute support for the heroic struggle of Hong Kong patriots.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Guangzhou on the 19th, activities denouncing the British authorities in Hong Kong for their bloody suppression of Hong Kong patriots have been ongoing in Guangzhou for five days and reached a climax today. Over the past five days, 800,000 revolutionary masses in Guangzhou have held grand rallies and protest marches.

From morning to evening today, protest marches filled the streets, with slogans echoing everywhere. In the afternoon, people from all walks of life held another grand protest rally. Revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students and teachers, revolutionary cadres, militias, and PLA soldiers and officers, as well as foreign friends from Sri Lanka, Denmark, Colombia, and other countries in Guangzhou, participated in today's rally.

A representative of the People's Liberation Army spoke at the rally. He sternly warned the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. The 40 million people of Guangdong Province will resolutely stand with the people of the entire country to be a strong backing for Hong Kong patriots and resolutely support them in carrying out their just struggle against oppression to the end.

The rally passed a message of condolence to Hong Kong patriots. After the rally, the revolutionary masses held a grand protest march.
