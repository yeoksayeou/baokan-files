Comrades, friends, fellow revolutionary comrades of the proletariat, dear little Red Guards!

First of all, let us together wish our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao a long life! Long live Chairman Mao! May Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, enjoy good health and live forever!

Today marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." These 25 years have been an unprecedented period of rapid development in the history of our motherland. Over the past 25 years, our great motherland has undergone tremendous changes: the Chinese people not only defeated the brutal Japanese fascist invaders, overthrew the reactionary Kuomintang, drove out the imperialists of the United States and Britain, removed the three mountains of oppression from the heads of the Chinese people, and achieved national liberation, but also, after liberation, achieved brilliant victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Who led us to transform a semi-feudal, semi-colonial old China that was oppressed, exploited, dark, and impoverished into an independent, unified, bright, and powerful socialist new China? It was our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao! It was the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. Now, many comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions around the world say it well: Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time.

Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times.

Since its birth, Marxism has gone through three great stages of development. The first stage is the stage of Marx and Engels, who established Marxism and proposed the theory of scientific socialism. The second stage is the stage of Leninism. Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism in the era of capitalism entering imperialism, solving a series of problems of the proletarian revolution, especially the theoretical and practical problems of achieving proletarian dictatorship in one country. The third stage is the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the further development of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively solved a series of important problems of the contemporary proletarian revolution, especially the theoretical and practical problems of preventing capitalist restoration under the historical conditions of proletarian dictatorship, thus raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage.

On the eve of the October Revolution, Lenin emphasized: "Whoever merely acknowledges class struggle is not a Marxist; he may still be in the circle of bourgeois thought and bourgeois policy." "Only those who acknowledge class struggle and also acknowledge proletarian dictatorship are Marxists." Today, whoever merely acknowledges proletarian dictatorship in words but does not acknowledge that under the historical conditions of proletarian dictatorship, there still exists the struggle of restoration and counter-restoration, the struggle between the proletariat to defend proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship, is not a true Marxist. Our great leader Chairman Mao, based on the lessons of the emergence of modern revisionism and capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union, the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, and the situation of a small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party engaging in activities to restore capitalism, developed the Marxism-Leninism on proletarian dictatorship, proposed a complete revolutionary theory to oppose counter-revolutionary revisionism and defend proletarian dictatorship, and personally initiated and led the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution movement of hundreds of millions of people, making great contributions to the international proletarian revolutionary movement in theory and practice.

In the brilliant treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is a dazzling Marxist-Leninist masterpiece. It is the first and most complete, systematic, and correct charter for the proletarian cultural revolution in the history of proletarian revolution. It is a universal truth that applies everywhere. It is a landmark document in the history of human culture.

When this brilliant document was published in 1942, the international anti-fascist war and the domestic war of resistance against Japan were at their most difficult stages. At this time, Zhou Yang, Wang Shiwei, Ding Ling, and a small clique of anti-party elements, Trotskyites, and traitors, spread a large number of poisonous weeds and launched a fierce attack on the party. They maliciously attacked the party's leadership, vigorously advocated "creative freedom," opposed the Marxist class struggle viewpoint, and propagated the bourgeois "human nature" and "love for humanity." They opposed singing the praises of the proletariat, saying things like "there are also black spots in the sun" and "the task of literature and art is to expose," attempting to incite others to attack the party and the people. The anti-party countercurrent stirred up by Zhou Yang, Wang Shiwei, Ding Ling, and others in the Yan'an literary and art circles was a cultural front complement to the fierce attack launched by the reactionary Kuomintang on the liberated areas. Their goal was to disintegrate the revolutionary ranks, undermine the people's government in the base areas, and undermine the war of resistance against Japan.

At that time, the great Rectification Movement in the history of our party was being carried out on a large scale, and the struggle between the two lines on the political, ideological, and cultural fronts was very sharp. The Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art was an important part of this great Rectification Movement. Chairman Mao's speech at this meeting, which has extremely important historical significance, is the guiding principle of the great Rectification Movement in Yan'an, and the guiding principle for building a Marxist-Leninist, Mao Zedong Thought party. Chairman Mao's speech conducted an extremely profound criticism of the anti-party countercurrent and various bourgeois reactionary trends that appeared on the cultural front at that time. Chairman Mao pointed out: proletarian literature and art is a part of the entire revolutionary cause of the proletariat. The revolutionary literary and art troops are an army serving political struggle and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao said: "In our struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people, there are various fronts, among which we can also say there are military and cultural fronts. We must first rely on the army with guns in their hands to defeat the enemy. But having only this kind of army is not enough; we also need a cultural army. This is an indispensable army for uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy." He also pointed out that proletarian literature and art is "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy, helping the people to fight the enemy with one heart and one mind," and is a tool for seeking liberation and seizing power. Chairman Mao's view of literary and art workers as an army serving the liberation struggle of the Chinese people fundamentally solved the relationship between literature and art and politics. In his speech, Chairman Mao also solved the problem of the general direction of the struggle for the proletarian cultural army. He pointed out: literature and art serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which is the fundamental direction of proletarian literature and art.

The proletarian revolutionary literary and art line proposed by Chairman Mao pointed out a clear battle target and direction of struggle for revolutionary literary and art workers, striking at the enemy's vital points and repelling the fierce attack of the small clique of anti-party elements, Trotskyites, and traitors led by Zhou Yang, Wang Shiwei, and Ding Ling. After Chairman Mao's speech, outstanding literary and art workers in the liberated areas responded to Chairman Mao's call, went to the workers, peasants, and soldiers with the belief of fighting for the liberation cause of the Chinese people, learned from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and portrayed the workers, peasants, and soldiers. With the weapon of literature and art, they inspired the masses, struck at the enemy, and annihilated the enemy. In the great cause of national liberation and people's liberation, and in the struggle to seize and consolidate people's power, they established meritorious deeds.

Today, in the high tide of the proletarian cultural revolution, when the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country are uniting to launch a general offensive against the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, it is of extremely important practical significance to solemnly commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's epoch-making great work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

The victory of the socialist revolution and the victory of the proletarian struggle for power do not mean the end of class struggle. On the eve of national liberation, Chairman Mao said, "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies." After the proletariat seizes power, the defeated class enemies are always trying to carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. The question of who defeats whom has not been settled. The exploiting classes want to seize back the power they have lost and must first create public opinion to prepare ideologically for their counter-revolutionary restoration activities. Literature and art are the frontline for them to create counter-revolutionary restoration public opinion and carry out the conspiracy to usurp the party, the army, and the government. The small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists who usurped the leadership of the cultural circle, such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Moqian, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Deng Tuo, and others, controlled and dominated the old Central Propaganda Department, the old Ministry of Culture, the old Beijing Municipal Committee, and various associations under the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, seizing the leadership of many (not all) cultural and publishing organs, turning these organs and organizations into clubs of revisionism and tools of the bourgeoisie to oppose the party and socialism.

The conspiratorial activities of the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists who usurped the leadership of the cultural circle were long ago seen through by our wise and great leader. In 1963 and 1964, Chairman Mao pointed out many times: since liberation, the various departments of literature and art, literature, drama, film, folk art, music, fine arts, dance, art academies, "basically (not all people) do not implement the party's policies, act as officials and lords, do not approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and do not reflect the socialist revolution and construction." Many departments are "ruled by the dead." On our stage, the main position is not occupied by workers, peasants, and soldiers, the true creators of history, but by emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, ghosts, and snakes, feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism have monopolized our stage. Especially during the period of economic difficulties from 1959 to 1962, a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the support of the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, took the opportunity to throw out a large number of poisonous weeds such as "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," "Xie Yaohuan," and "Li Huiming," etc., hinting at and attacking our great party, rehabilitating the right-opportunists who were dismissed at the Lushan Conference, such as Peng Dehuai, etc., attempting to incite others to join them in carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. At the same time, a large number of plays that sang the praises of traitors, advocated capitulationism, and advocated the philosophy of survival, such as "The Orphan of Zhao," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Li Xiangjun," "Li Xiancheng," "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," "The Road," etc., also emerged. The situation in the film industry was even more prominent. From the early films such as "The Last Days of the Manchu Dynasty" and "The Life of Wu Xun" to "The City That Never Sleeps," "The Lin Family Shop," "Two Families," "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles," "The Enemy at the Gates," "Early Spring in February," etc., how much poison they spread! They, in order to advocate the capitalist road and realize their counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy, maliciously defamed the workers, peasants, and soldiers, beautified the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism, and did all kinds of evil deeds. They also, according to the will of the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, distorted the history of the party and, on the screen, wrote the biography of China's Khrushchev and cheered for the right-opportunists.

Chairman Mao pointed out, "Using novels to carry out anti-party activities is a great invention." Zhou Yang and other small cliques of counter-revolutionary revisionists did just that. Under their plot, a counter-revolutionary novel to rehabilitate the notorious anti-party element Gao Gang also emerged. This novel blatantly distorted history and aimed at our great leader Chairman Mao and the party central committee.

However, the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists could not escape the mirror of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Their true faces of opposing the party and socialism were exposed in the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, with nowhere to hide. Therefore, this group of ghosts and snakes is extremely afraid of this speech and extremely hates this speech. They used all kinds of despicable means to spread all kinds of fallacies, such as the "write reality" theory, the "broad road of realism" theory, the "deepening of realism" theory, the anti-"theme determines" theory, the "middle character" theory, the anti-"gunpowder smell" theory, the "convergence of the spirit of the times" theory, etc., to attack Chairman Mao's brilliant work. They also, under the banner of red, opposed the red, using the propaganda of the speech to distort and castrate the fundamental spirit of the speech.

"An ant trying to shake a big tree, laughable and self-deluding." Their attacks on Chairman Mao's brilliant work and all their fallacies have long been criticized to the point of having no integrity left. The broad revolutionary masses, armed with this powerful weapon of the speech, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, have carried out one struggle after another against the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the reactionary "authorities." As early as 1951, Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the criticism of the reactionary film "The Life of Wu Xun." In 1954, Chairman Mao again personally initiated and led the criticism of "The Research on Dream of the Red Chamber" and Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts. From 1954 to 1955, the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique was carried out, and since 1957, the struggle against the rightists, the struggle against right-opportunism, the criticism of Yang Xianzhen's "unification of two into one" theory, and the criticism of Zhou Guocheng's "convergence of the spirit of the times" theory were carried out. Especially in 1962, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao issued a great battle call to the whole party and the whole nation, "Never forget class struggle," and proposed to grasp the class struggle in the ideological field. In 1963 and 1964, Chairman Mao made two extremely important instructions on literary and art work, giving a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art represented by the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. After Chairman Mao issued two extremely important instructions, the bravest warriors on the cultural front, Comrade Jiang Qing, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, leading the vanguard of the cultural revolution, and launched an attack on the stage of art dominated by the old lords. They broke through the layer upon layer of suppression and obstruction by the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and for the first time made the heroic images of the true creators of history—the workers, peasants, and soldiers—shine brightly on the stages of Peking opera, ballet, and symphony music. The old lords, ladies, young masters, and young mistresses who had long dominated the stage of art began to be driven off. The history that had been overturned was overturned again. This is a glorious milestone in the history of the proletarian cultural revolution. All these victories of struggle are the victories of the proletarian revolutionary literary and art line represented by Chairman Mao, and they are also the victories of this great work.

The time for the proletariat to launch a counterattack against the bourgeoisie has come.

In November 1965, the proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, initiated the criticism of "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," fired the first shot at the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and sounded the advance call for the proletarian cultural revolution.

In February 1966, Comrade Jiang Qing, on behalf of Comrade Lin Biao, convened the army literary and art work symposium. This meeting is a very important meeting in the history of China's cultural struggle. As Comrade Jiang Qing said, this meeting invited the "gods" who protect proletarian dictatorship—the People's Liberation Army—to launch a fierce attack on the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and those bourgeois reactionary "authorities" who had long monopolized the leadership of the cultural circle.

The symposium, under the chairmanship of Comrade Jiang Qing, formulated the "Minutes of the Army Literary and Art Work Symposium." This "Minutes" was personally revised three times by Chairman Mao, providing an extremely profound and correct analysis of many fundamental issues in the struggle between the two lines on the literary and art front since liberation. The "Minutes" swept away the evil winds and mists spread by the bourgeoisie in the cultural circle for many years, crushed their arrogance, disarmed them, and won the first battle for the proletarian cultural revolution. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: this "Minutes" is "a very good document, using Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major issues of the cultural revolution in the socialist period, which not only has great practical significance but also has far-reaching historical significance."

Immediately afterwards, Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the great historical document—the May 16th Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This Notification systematically proposed the theory, line, policy, and principles of the proletarian cultural revolution, smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist program of capitalist restoration concocted by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, repelled their counterattack, disrupted their lines, and launched a nationwide, resounding, and magnificent proletarian cultural revolution movement.

The revolutionary masses and revolutionary Red Guards armed with Mao Zedong Thought surged forward like an irresistible torrent, charging straight into the hell of the ghosts and snakes.

The old Central Propaganda Department collapsed!
The old Ministry of Culture collapsed!
The old Beijing Municipal Committee collapsed!

Those who were once arrogant and self-important, pretending to be "big figures," were actually paper tigers that could not withstand a single blow!

Comrades! From the sharp struggles on the cultural front since national liberation, it can be seen that the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and art line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art is, in the final analysis, a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for restoration and counter-restoration.

Under the historical conditions of proletarian dictatorship, in the class struggle whose main content is the struggle for restoration and counter-restoration, the revolutionary cultural army is an important force to oppose capitalist restoration and prevent the spread of revisionism. Defending proletarian dictatorship mainly relies on the people's army with guns in their hands, but the cultural army is also indispensable. The cultural army, like the People's Liberation Army of China, also bears the heavy responsibility of defending the great proletarian dictatorship and the great socialist cause.

This unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution that shook the world has proven that the revolutionary cultural army is a powerful assault force in the attack on counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Today, on the occasion of commemorating the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," we must fully recognize the important role of the revolutionary cultural army in the struggle to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration. Chairman Mao's speech is the charter for the construction of the proletarian cultural army. To make this cultural army more powerful, we must use Chairman Mao's great charter for construction to correct our direction, build our troops, and arm our warriors.

The proletarian cultural army is advancing in the great storms of the proletarian cultural revolution. Various problems are presented to every warrior, where is the cultural circle going? What is the current battle task? What are the policies and principles of the cultural front? All these problems can be solved in Chairman Mao's speech.

First, adhere to Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively participate in the revolutionary great criticism movement, and fight to defend proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao pointed out in his speech: "The question of whom to serve is a fundamental question, a question of principle." This is the question of the direction of literary and art work. Is literature and art to serve the thousands and millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers, or to serve a small clique of the exploiting classes? Is it to serve the defense of proletarian dictatorship, or to serve the restoration activities of a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists? This is the focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and art line and the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art. The practice of the struggle between the two lines in the cultural circle over the past 17 years tells us: the cultural circle, which has been long controlled and influenced by the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, has the most fundamental problem of direction. Once this fundamental problem of direction is solved, all other controversial issues can be resolved. If this problem is not solved, then all other problems cannot be solved. Only by solving the fundamental problem of the direction of literary and art work in both theory and practice can we stand firmly on the revolutionary standpoint of the proletariat, fight to defend proletarian dictatorship, fight against capitalist restoration, and fight to defend socialism!

The workers, peasants, and soldiers are the true creators of history and the masters of socialist society. Literary and art workers must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers and must go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery struggle, move the standpoint "to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat," and undergo a thorough transformation of one's thoughts, feelings, and worldview in the three great revolutionary movements. Only by uniting with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, familiarizing oneself with their lives and thoughts, learning their language, creating the image of the heroes of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and depicting the magnificent socialist revolution and socialist construction, can literature and art truly become a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking at the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

The small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists used the tactics of two-facedness to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They put forward the slogan of "literature and art for the whole people" to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line.

In 1962, on the 20th anniversary of the publication of the speech, Zhou Yang, Lin Moqian, and others held a false commemoration and concocted a big poisonous weed titled "Serving the Broadest Masses of the People," proposing that literature and art should serve "all the people," including the bourgeoisie, and raising the reactionary black flag of "literature and art for the whole people." They even openly said, "Socialist culture is the culture of the whole people."

Can proletarian literature and art serve the bourgeoisie? Can socialist culture be the culture of the whole people?

Absolutely not. Chairman Mao had long ago refuted this absurd proposition in his speech.

"The literature and art for the whole people" is not a new argument; it is just a copy of Khrushchev's "state of the whole people" and "party of the whole people" in the field of literature and art. There will never be such a thing as "literature and art for the whole people" in the world. Literature and art are either for the proletariat or for the bourgeoisie. Zhou Yang and Lin Moqian's theory of "literature and art for the whole people" is to use the pretext of being above classes to oppose literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, oppose literature and art serving proletarian politics, and turn literature and art into a counter-revolutionary tool for capitalist restoration.

The most important task in the proletarian cultural revolution in the cultural circle is to solve this problem of direction.

Without destruction, there can be no construction. We must, in the movement to launch a great criticism against the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, thoroughly criticize their direction of literature and art serving counter-revolutionary revisionism, and firmly establish our direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We must use Chairman Mao's speech as a weapon, actively participate in the great criticism movement, defend proletarian dictatorship, and defend the socialist mountains and rivers.

Now, in the cultural circle, there is a so-called "debate between 17 years and 50 days," with the focus of the debate being: is the current cultural circle criticizing the 17-year counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art, or is it criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of the past 50 days in June and July last year? This debate has aroused the wide interest of comrades in the cultural circle. In fact, these two issues are not isolated. Moreover, the bourgeois reactionary line is not just a matter of 50 days. The criticism of the 17-year counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line in the proletarian cultural revolution should be and can be combined. In the proletarian cultural revolution, the bourgeois reactionary line proposed by the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party is precisely to protect their counter-revolutionary revisionist line and, of course, to protect their 17-year counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art. We must criticize both the 17-year counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the bourgeois reactionary line that protects this black line in literature and art. The representative of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the proposer of the bourgeois reactionary line are both the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. The most important task of the current great criticism movement is to thoroughly criticize this representative of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and the proposer of the bourgeois reactionary line—the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Only in this way can we truly establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions! Take up your pens as weapons, and in this moment of the proletariat launching a general offensive against the bourgeoisie, bravely join the great criticism movement and fiercely strike at the enemy!

Second, organize the leftist forces and do well in the struggle, criticism, and reform of your unit.

The phenomenon of the bourgeoisie ruling our cultural circle can no longer continue. The leadership organs, cultural organizations, and art academies that have been monopolized and controlled by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists for 17 years must be seized by the proletarian revolutionary factions.

To organize a vast proletarian cultural revolution army, each unit must gradually form a strong leftist force in the struggle. The proletarian revolutionary factions must, in the revolutionary great criticism movement, achieve revolutionary great unity, work together to do well in the struggle, criticism, and reform of their units, direct the spearhead of the struggle at the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, expose their crimes, eliminate their poison, and fight them down, fight them black, and fight them down!

Thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary authorities and reactionary "authorities."

In every place where power needs to be seized, new, truly revolutionary leadership cores must be established to lead this cultural force.

According to Chairman Mao's instructions in his speech, unite all forces that can be united, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and differentiate between the two types of contradictions. Some people support the party, support socialism, and support Chairman Mao, but have said some wrong words, done some wrong deeds, or written some bad works, or performed some bad plays. For them, we should not overthrow them but patiently help them, educate them, and not discriminate against them. As long as they dare to examine their mistakes and recognize their mistakes, we proletarian revolutionary factions should welcome them, unite with them, and together with them carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform.

Third, focus on creation, set models, and firmly establish the new proletarian culture.

To overthrow bourgeois literature and art and establish revolutionary proletarian literature and art, one of the keys is to focus on creation. Only with new creation can there be new literature, film, drama, music, dance, and fine arts. In general, according to the new situation of the proletarian cultural revolution, each cultural unit should, on the one hand, carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform of its unit, and on the other hand, create and perform modern, revolutionary, and proletarian literature and art works that serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Pay attention to and develop the creation of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The excellent literary and art works that emerge from the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers reflect the new appearance of the era of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country. All revolutionary literary and art workers should humbly learn from them.

The key to focusing on creation is to set up excellent models. The power of models is great. Only with models can one persuade people, thoroughly destroy the old things, and open up the way forward for new things. The modern Peking operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Port," "The Red Lantern," "The White-Haired Girl," "The Red Detachment of Women," "The Red Guards," "The Red Army Fights Against Japan," and the revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl," and the symphony music "The Red Detachment of Women" are a batch of excellent models, a batch of new artistic models shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. They have united revolutionary political content with perfect artistic form. The appearance of this batch of excellent artistic models is the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary and art line.

The proletariat needs excellent works that combine realistic revolutionary struggle and magnificent revolutionary ideals. Such excellent works can only be achieved by adopting the method of combining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism proposed by Chairman Mao.

Blindly worshipping the past, foreigners, and revisionism, and the "speak of Greece" spirit of Jia Gui must be overthrown. Do not believe in heaven, do not believe in earth, and absolutely do not believe in foreigners, fame, or the past. Only believe in the workers, peasants, and soldiers, only believe in the proletariat, only believe in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. What ancient Peking operas, films from the 1930s, French literature, British Shakespeare, Russian three "skis," and Soviet revisionist Sholokhov, all do not need to be worshipped. Ancient good things, we should inherit critically; foreign good things, we should absorb critically. But we should do it according to Chairman Mao's instructions of "using the past to serve the present" and "using foreigners to serve China," and absolutely should not let the toys of the exploiting classes lead us by the nose.

Looking down on the laboring people, looking down on the proletariat, worshipping others, and humbly catering to others' needs will never amount to anything. Our world-shaking artistic treasures are not the "Buddha-like" foreign experts worshipped by the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, who copied "Swan Lake" from the bourgeoisie, but our own revolutionary ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl." Our "The Red Detachment of Women" and "The White-Haired Girl" were not originally intended to be performed for the whole world, but they have been welcomed by the progressive people of the whole world. The progressive people of the whole world did not expect that an ancient art that was gradually declining in the Western world would gain new life in the Eastern world. The small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their supporters call our own artistic treasures "country bumpkins" and regard foreign backward things as heavenly gods. After eating a few slices of foreign bread, they "forget their ancestors" and say, "the moon is also round in foreign countries." They really do not know if they still know that there are shameful things in the world!

We should learn from the pioneers of the revolution of Peking opera, ballet, and symphony music, and the vanguard warriors of these drama, dance, and music revolutions. The revolution of Peking opera, ballet, and symphony music is the most arduous battle on the literary and art front. They are the prelude to this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. The difficulties are great, and the struggle is arduous. The various attacks, slanders, rumors, strikes, and traps of the bourgeoisie and those ghosts and snakes are constantly falling on the heads of the vanguard warriors of the literary and art front. However, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" inspires them, and they are undaunted and fearless. To seize the literary and art front from the bourgeoisie and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line, the vanguard of the cultural revolution, led by Comrade Jiang Qing, has been fighting tenaciously and continuously. After overcoming countless difficulties and obstacles, they finally opened up a bright path with the invincible weapon of Mao Zedong Thought on the thorny wilderness. Their brave, tenacious, and indomitable revolutionary fighting spirit is a model for all cultural warriors. If the fortresses of Peking opera, ballet, and symphony music, which are so stubborn, have been captured by our vanguard warriors, then what literary and art fortresses in the world cannot be captured? Cultural warriors, raise high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought and advance with unwavering confidence!

Fourth, carry out mass literary and art criticism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the main methods of struggle in the literary and art circles is literary and art criticism." Literary and art criticism must adhere to the principle of political standards first and artistic standards second. All reactionary literary and art thoughts and works that endanger proletarian dictatorship and the socialist revolutionary cause must be criticized, and these poisonous weeds must not be allowed to spread freely and poison the people.

The small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their supporters vigorously advocate a theory of "harmlessness," saying things like "as long as a play makes people feel rested and happy, it is good." The "harmlessness" they talk about is completely deceitful. The foreign "harmless" films they openly advocate to be shown everywhere are all works that advocate capitalism and revisionism. The "harmless" plays they openly advocate to be performed everywhere are all works that advocate the exploiting classes, defame the laboring people, and even hint at opposing the party and socialism. Is there really such a thing as a "harmless" work in the world? No. Chairman Mao teaches us in his speech: "In the present world, all culture or literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line." For you, it is harmless, but for me, it is harmful. Where is there such a literary and art work that is harmless to all classes? Haven't the poisonous effects of bourgeois and revisionist decadent literary and art works on the laboring people, especially the younger generation, been enough? The theory of "harmlessness" promoted by the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists is to use this shield to block the criticism of the masses, to let various anti-party and anti-socialist big poisonous weeds be labeled as "harmless" and sold to hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, and their purpose is to use these literary and art works to numb and poison the laboring people to realize their conspiracy of peaceful evolution and capitalist restoration.

The small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists also use the banner of "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to resist literary and art criticism. They shout loudly, saying "to let," "to have the freedom to let," "to include and tolerate," "free competition," "examination should be broad," "do not interfere too much," "do not be rude," and use these slogans to open up the road for their poisonous weeds to emerge and create public opinion for their counter-revolutionary activities of bourgeois restoration.

They completely distort Chairman Mao's policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," stripping this great policy of its class content. The policy of "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is the class policy of the proletariat, aimed at consolidating proletarian dictatorship and serving the prosperity of proletarian culture. When Chairman Mao expounded this policy, he said: "We will still have to wage a long struggle against the bourgeoisie and petty-bourgeoisie thought. Not understanding this situation and abandoning ideological struggle is wrong. All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, all ghosts and snakes must be criticized and cannot be allowed to spread freely." Chairman Mao also said, "To let means to let everyone speak freely, so that people dare to speak, dare to criticize, and dare to argue." But their so-called "to let" is bourgeois liberalization, allowing only poisonous weeds to bloom and not allowing fragrant flowers to bloom, allowing only the rightists to sing and not allowing the leftists to contend. This is to let the bourgeoisie seize our proletarian power, and we absolutely do not agree! We must, as Chairman Mao teaches, uproot all the poisonous weeds they let out.

What "do not be rude"? The truly rude ones are not others; the truly rude ones are the bourgeois lords. What "articles of small figures" and "party newspapers are not places for debate," are not all these people saying? The words are still ringing in our ears, and they cannot deny it.

Comrades! In the places ruled by the bourgeois lords, the proletariat is not even allowed to grow a single new sprout, is this not rude? As soon as a new thing appears, they want to suppress it fiercely, ridicule, scold, suppress, strike, encircle, and strangle, using all means, is there anything more rude than this?

As soon as the revolution of Peking opera produced a few models, the bourgeois lords wanted to suppress it and destroy it. Unable to suppress it and destroy it, they opened their mouths to curse, saying things like "modern Peking opera is like plain water" and "spoken drama plus singing." The accusations are endless. As the vanguard warriors of the Peking opera revolution said, "These people are simply ignorant! What's wrong with plain water? With plain water, you can brew tea and make wine. Without plain water, you can't even live. What's wrong with 'spoken drama plus singing'? From the beginning, Peking opera has been spoken drama plus singing. Without speaking and singing, where is the play?" The bourgeois lords, you, in order to oppose a model of the Peking opera revolution, even lose your face, talking nonsense and blabbering. This is not rude? What "modern Peking opera is like plain water"! What "spoken drama plus singing"! Are you not satisfied? Let's compare the best old Peking opera with our models! Which is better, our modern opera with workers, peasants, and soldiers performing beautifully, or the old Peking opera with lords, ladies, young masters, and young mistresses performing beautifully? The emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on the stage of old Peking opera are ugly from soul to image, can they compare with the workers, peasants, and soldiers on our stage? Let's not talk about political and ideological aspects; even in terms of artistry, they are far inferior to us. Our modern opera does not have the sloppy appearance of old Peking opera, dragging and sloppy.

Old Peking opera has been around for more than 130 years, and we have only been around for 3 or 4 years. The new 3 or 4 years have defeated the old 130 years. The revolution has touched the nerves of the bourgeois lords, and your rude rule can no longer be maintained. So you bite back at us, saying we are rude, really confusing black and white and reversing right and wrong! We are not rude at all; we are too polite. You take back all this nonsense!

The small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists are most afraid of mass criticism; they call our criticism "sticks." Chairman Mao says: whatever the enemy opposes, we support. What they are afraid of is precisely what we advocate. We must develop mass literary and art criticism. If mass criticism is called "sticks," then this is the "steel sticks" and "gold sticks" of the proletariat beating the bourgeoisie and revisionism, which are very precious. Moreover, we can tell the bourgeois lords that after the proletarian cultural revolution, this "stick" will develop greatly in the future.

We must break the "expert" line in literary and art criticism. Treating literary and art criticism as the "ivory tower" of intellectuals and monopolizing it by a few people is completely wrong.

The masses have sharp eyes. The weapon of literary and art criticism should be handed over to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to wield. Because the most concerned about the proletarian revolutionary cause and the most protective of proletarian dictatorship are the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Only by mobilizing the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country to examine literary and art works can we uproot the true poisonous weeds and protect the true fragrant flowers. Only by mobilizing the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country to examine literary and art works can we improve the quality of creation and prosper the cause of revolutionary literary and art creation.

Mass literary and art criticism is very good; we should cheer for it.

Comrades! The unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution movement has opened up a new era that is extremely favorable for the great development of proletarian literature and art. The decadent old culture of the exploiting classes has collapsed under the impact of the proletarian cultural revolution storm. A brilliant new era of revolutionary culture has arrived!

Chairman Mao teaches us: the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the two classes and the two lines, is long-term, tortuous, and complex, and "the victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided only after a very long historical period." The enemy will continue to wage the struggle of restoration and counter-restoration with us in the future. The cultural front is at the forefront of class struggle, and the struggle is more complex and arduous. On our forward march, we will still encounter new difficulties and obstacles, but the wheel of history is irresistible, and the boundless sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought shines upon us. No difficulties and obstacles can stop our march forward.

Comrades, new victories await us. Let us arm ourselves with the brilliant works of our great leader, constantly reform ourselves, closely follow Chairman Mao, closely follow the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and carry on the revolution forever. For the defense of the great proletarian dictatorship and the construction of the most magnificent and brilliant proletarian revolutionary culture in human history, let us strive!

Let all the reactionaries who go against the historical trend tremble before the great victory of the proletariat!

Long live the proletarian cultural revolution!
Long live proletarian dictatorship!
Long live the great Communist Party of China!
Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!

    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是无产阶级文化大军的建军纲领
    戚本禹同志们，朋友们，无产阶级革命派的战友们，亲爱的红卫兵小将们！
    首先，让我们共同祝福我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！祝福毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志身体健康，永远健康！
    （一）
    今天是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的日子。这二十五年，是我们祖国几千年历史上从所未有的飞跃发展时期。二十五年来，我们伟大的祖国经历了天翻地覆的变化：中国人民不仅战胜了残暴的日本法西斯侵略者，打垮了国民党反动派，赶走了美、英帝国主义，搬掉了压在中国人民头上的三座大山，获得了全国的解放，而且在解放以后，又取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的辉煌胜利。是谁领导我们将一个被压迫、被剥削、黑暗、贫困的半封建、半殖民地的旧中国，变成了一个独立、统一、光明、强大的社会主义新中国？是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席！是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席！
    毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。现在世界上许多无产阶级革命派的同志们说得好，毛主席就是当代的列宁。
    毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。
    马克思主义从它诞生以来，经历了三个伟大的发展阶段。第一阶段是马克思、恩格斯的阶段，他们创立了马克思主义，提出了科学社会主义的理论。第二
  阶段是列宁主义的阶段。列宁和斯大林在资本主义进入到帝国主义的时代，发展了马克思主义，解决了无产阶级革命的一系列问题，特别是解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题。第三个阶段就是毛泽东思想的阶段。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，进一步发展了的马克思列宁主义。我们伟大的领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列重要问题，特别是解决了在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，进行革命，防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，从而把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。
    十月革命的前夕，列宁强调指出：“谁要是仅仅承认阶级斗争，那他还不是马克思主义者，他可能还没有走出资产阶级思想和资产阶级政策的圈子。”“只有承认阶级斗争、同时也承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”在今天，谁要是仅仅在口头上承认无产阶级专政，而不承认在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，还存在着复辟和反复辟的斗争，存在着无产阶级为保卫无产阶级专政、资产阶级为推翻无产阶级专政而进行的斗争，那他就不是一个真正的马克思主义者。我们伟大领袖毛主席根据苏联出现现代修正主义，出现资本主义复辟的教训，根据国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，并且针对我国党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行资本主义复辟活动的情况，发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的学说，提出了极为完整的反对反革命修正主义、保卫无产阶级专政的革命理论，并且亲自发动和领导了亿万群众进行这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，在理论上和实践上对国际无产阶级革命运动做出了伟大的贡献。
    在光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想的宝库里，《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是一部光彩夺目的马克思列宁主义的伟大著作，它是无产阶级革命历史上第一次出现的最完整、最系统、最正确的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领，它是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，它是人类文化史上划时代的光辉文献。
    这部光辉文献在一九四二年发表的时候，国际反法西斯战争和国内抗日战争正处在最艰苦的阶段。就在这个时候，周扬、王实味、丁玲等一小撮反党分子、托派和叛徒，放出了大批毒草，向党发起猖狂进攻。他们恶毒地攻击党的领导，大肆鼓吹“创作自由”，反对马克思主义的阶级斗争观点，宣扬资产阶级的“人性论”和“人类之爱”；他们反对歌颂无产阶级的光明，胡说什么“太阳中也有黑点”，“文艺的任务就是暴露”，企图煽动别人出来攻击党和人民。周扬、王实味、丁玲等人在延安文艺界掀起的这股反党的逆流，是在文化战线上配合蒋介石反动派向解放区发动的猖狂进攻，他们的目的就是为了瓦解革命队伍，破坏根据地的人民政权，破坏抗日战争。
    当时，我们党的历史上著名的延安整风运动正在大规模地开展着，政治、思想、文化战线上的两条路线斗争是很尖锐的。延安文艺座谈会是这次伟大整风运动的重要组成部分。毛主席在这次会议上所作的具有极其重大历史意义的《讲话》，是伟大的延安整风运动的指南，是建设马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的政党的指南。毛主席的《讲话》对当时文化战线上出现的反党逆流和各种资产阶级的反动思潮，进行了极其深刻的批判。毛主席指出：无产阶级的文艺是无产阶级整个革命事业的一部分。革命文艺队伍是一支为政治斗争为无产阶级专政服务的军队。毛主席说：“在我们为中国人民解放的斗争中，有各种的战线，就中也可以说有文武两个战线，这就是文化战线和军事战线。我们要战胜敌人，首先要依靠手里拿枪的军队。但是仅仅有这种军队是不够的，我们还要有文化的军队，这是团结自己、战胜敌人必不可少的一支军队。”并且指出，无产阶级的文艺是“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”，是争取解放，夺取政权的工具。毛主席把文艺工作者看做是一支为中国人民解放斗争服务的军队的思想，从根本上解决了文艺同政治的关系。毛主席在《讲话》里还为无产阶级文化大军解决了斗争的大方向问题。他指出：文艺为工农兵服务，是无产阶级文艺的根本方向。
    毛主席提出的这一条无产阶级的革命文艺路线，为革命文艺工作者指出了明确的战斗目标和斗争方向，击中了敌人的要害，打退了周扬、王实味、丁玲等一小撮反党分子、托派和叛徒的猖狂进攻。毛主席讲话以后，解放区优秀的文艺工作者，响应毛主席的号召，带着为中国人民解放事业而斗争的信念，到工农兵中去，学习工农兵，表现工农兵，以文艺的武器去鼓舞群众、打击敌人、消灭敌人，在伟大的民族解放和人民解放事业中，在夺取和巩固人民政权的斗争中建立了战功。
    （二）
    今天，我们在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，在全国各地的无产阶级革命派联合起来，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击的时刻，来隆重纪念毛主席划时代的伟大著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，这是具有极其重大的现实意义的。
    社会主义革命的胜利，无产阶级夺权斗争的胜利，并不意味着阶级斗争的结束。在全国解放的前夕，毛主席就说过，“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。”在无产阶级夺取政权以后，被打倒的阶级敌人时刻都在企图进行反革命复辟，谁战胜谁的问题还没有解决。剥削阶级要夺回他们失去的政权，一定要首先制造舆论，为他们的反革命复辟活动做思想准备。文艺就是他们制造反革命复辟舆论，进行篡党、篡军、篡政阴谋的一个先头阵地。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和窃取了文化界领导权的一小撮反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一、周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍、田汉、邓拓等人，把持和控制了旧中央宣传部、旧文化部、旧北京市委、全国文联所属各协会，掌握了许多（不是全部）文化出版机关的领导权，把这些机关和团体变成了修正主义的俱乐部，变成了资产阶级反党反社会主义的工具。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和窃取了文化界领导权的一小撮反革命修正主义分子的阴谋活动，早就被我们英明、伟大的领袖识破了。一九六三年和一九六四年，毛主席曾多次指出：解放以来，文化艺术的各个部门，文学、戏剧、电影、曲艺、音乐、美术、舞蹈、艺术院校，“基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。”许多部门是被“‘死人’统治着”。在我们舞台上占主要地位的不是工农兵，不是历史的真正创造者，而是帝王将相，才子佳人，地富反坏，牛鬼蛇神，封建主义、资本主义、修正主义在舞台上专了我们的政。特别是一九五九年至一九六二年经济困难时期，一小撮反革命修正主义分子在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，乘机抛出《海瑞罢官》、《谢瑶环》、《李慧娘》等等一大批毒草，含沙射影地辱骂和攻击我们伟大的党，为庐山会议罢了官的右倾机会主义分子彭德怀等人翻案，企图煽动别人起来同他们一道进行反革命复辟活动。与此同时，一大批歌颂叛徒、宣扬投降主义、鼓吹活命哲学的戏剧，如《四郎探母》、《桃花扇》、《李香君》、《李秀成》、《上海屋檐下》、《丽人行》等等，也纷纷出笼。电影界里的情况，更为突出。从解放初期的《清宫秘史》、《武训传》到《不夜城》、《林家铺子》、《两家人》、《逆风千里》、《兵临城下》、《早春二月》等影片，放了多少毒！他们为了宣扬资本主义道路，实现其反革命复辟的阴谋，极力丑化工、农、兵，美化资、封、修，干尽了坏事。他们还秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，歪曲党的历史，在银幕上为中国的赫鲁晓夫立传，为右倾机会主义叫好。
    毛主席指出，“利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明”。周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子就是这样干的，在他们的策划下，为臭名昭著的反党分子高岗翻案的反党小说也出笼了。这部小说，公然篡改历史，矛头指向我们伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央。
    但是，这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的阴谋复辟活动，逃不脱毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这面光芒四射的照妖镜。他们反党反社会主义的真面目在毛泽东思想的照妖镜面前，原形毕露，无法躲藏。因此这一群牛鬼蛇神极端害怕这个《讲话》，极端仇恨这个《讲话》。他们用尽一切卑鄙的手段，散布种种谬论，如什么“写真实”论、“现实主义广阔的道路”论、“现实主义的深化”论、反“题材决定”论、“中间人物”论、反“火药味”论、“时代精神汇合”论等等，来攻击毛主席这篇光辉的著作。他们还打着红旗反红旗，以宣传《讲话》为名，歪曲和阉割《讲话》的根本精神。
    “蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。他们对毛主席光辉著作的种种攻击，他们所有的谬论，早就被毛主席的《讲话》批判得体无完肤。掌握了《讲话》这一威力强大武器的广大革命群众，在毛主席的亲自领导下，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及反动学术“权威”进行了一次又一次的针锋相对的斗争。早在一九五一年，毛主席就亲自发动和领导了对反动电影《武训传》的批判。一九五四年，毛主席又亲自发动和领导了对《〈红楼梦〉研究》和胡适反动思想的批判。一九五四年至一九五五年，进行了反对胡风反革命集团的斗争，一九五七年以来又进行了反右派斗争、反右倾机会主义斗争、批判杨献珍的“合二而一”论、批判周谷城的“时代精神汇合”论的斗争。特别是一九六二年，在党的八届十中全会上，毛主席向全党全国人民发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大战斗号召，并提出了要抓意识形态领域的阶级斗争。一九六三、六四年，毛主席先后对文艺工作作了两次极其重要的批示，给了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，以沉重的打击。在毛主席发出了两次极其重要的批示以后，文化战线上最勇敢的战士江青同志，热烈响应毛主席的号召，率领文化革命的先锋战士，向剥削阶级的老爷们盘踞的艺术舞台发起了进攻。他们冲破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的层层压制和阻挠，在京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐的舞台上，第一次使历史的真正创造者——工农兵的英雄形象大放光彩。长期统治艺术舞台的老爷、太太、少爷、小姐们，开始被赶下台了。被颠倒了的历史再颠倒了过来，这是无产阶级文化革命史上一个光辉的里程碑。所有这些斗争的胜利，都是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命文艺路线的胜利，也是毛主席这一伟大著作的胜利。
    无产阶级向资产阶级实行大反攻的时刻到来了。
    一九六五年十一月，上海的无产阶级革命派坚决贯彻毛主席在八届十中全会上的指示，在江青同志的领导下，发动了对《海瑞罢官》的批判，向彭真反革命修正主义集团投出了第一枪，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命的进军号。
    一九六六年二月，江青同志受林彪同志的委托，又召开了部队文艺工作座谈会。这次会议是中国文化斗争史上非常重要的一次会议。正象江青同志所说的，这次会议请来了保卫无产阶级专政的“尊神”——中国人民解放军，向长期把持文化界领导权的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和那些资产阶级反动“权威”发动了一场猛烈的攻击。
    座谈会在江青同志的主持下，制定了《部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》。这个《纪要》经过毛主席三次亲自修改，对解放以来文艺战线上两条路线斗争的许多根本问题作了极其深刻的、正确的分析。《纪要》横扫了多少年来资产阶级在文化界散布的妖风迷雾，灭了他们的威风，缴了他们的械，为无产阶级文化大革命打胜了第一仗。林彪同志指出：这个《纪要》“是一个很好的文件，用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，不仅有极大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义。”
    紧接着，毛主席亲自主持制定了伟大的历史文件——中共中央五月十六日《通知》。这个《通知》系统地提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，粉碎了以彭真为代表的反革命修正主义集团炮制的资本主义复辟的反动纲领《二月提纲》，击退了他们的反扑，打乱了他们的阵线，掀起了一个席卷全国的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众和革命的红卫兵小将象一股势不可挡的洪流，直冲牛鬼蛇神统治的阎王殿。
    旧中宣部垮台了！
    旧文化部垮台了！
    旧北京市委垮台了！
    那些平日不可一世，以“大人物”自居的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，貌似庞然大物，其实只不过是不堪一击的纸老虎！
    （三）
    同志们！从全国解放以来文化战线上的尖锐斗争中可以看出，毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线同反革命修正主义文艺黑线所作的斗争，归根到底是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级之间的复辟和反复辟的斗争。
    在无产阶级专政的历史条件下，以复辟和反复辟斗争为主要内容的阶级斗争中，革命的文化大军是反对资本主义复辟、防止修正主义泛滥的重要力量。保卫无产阶级专政，主要的是依靠手里拿枪的人民军队，但是文化大军也是不可缺少的。文化大军同中国人民解放军同样肩负着保卫伟大的无产阶级专政，保卫伟大的社会主义事业的重任。
    这次震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，证明了革命的文化大军是向反革命修正主义进攻的一支有力的突击队。
    今天，在纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，我们要充分认识革命文化大军在巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的斗争中所起的重要作用。毛主席的《讲话》就是无产阶级文化大军的建军纲领。为了使这支文化大军发挥更大的威力，我们必须用毛主席《讲话》这个伟大的建军纲领来端正我们的方向，建设我们的队伍，武装我们的战士。
    无产阶级的文化大军在无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中前进着，各种各样的问题摆在我们每个战士的面前，文艺界向何处去？当前的战斗任务是什么？文艺战线的方针、政策是什么？所有这些问题，都可以在毛主席《讲话》中得到解决。
    第一，坚持毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务的方向，积极参加革命的大批判运动，为保卫无产阶级专政而战斗。
    毛主席在《讲话》中指出：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”这就是文艺工作的方向问题。文艺是为千百万工农兵服务，还是为一小撮剥削阶级服务？是为保卫无产阶级专政服务，还是为一小撮反革命修正主义分子的复辟活动服务？这是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线和反革命修正主义文艺黑线斗争的焦点。文化界十七年来两条路线斗争的实践告诉我们：被反革命修正主义文艺黑线长期控制和影响的文化界，要解决的最根本的问题还是个方向问题。这个根本的方向问题解决了，其它的一切争论问题就可以迎刃而解了。如果这个问题不解决，那么，其他一切问题都不能解决。只有不仅在理论上，而且在实践中解决了文艺工作的大方向问题，我们才会站稳无产阶级的革命立场，为保卫无产阶级专政而战斗，为反对资本主义复辟而战斗，为保卫社会主义而战斗！
    工农兵群众是历史的真正创造者，是社会主义社会的主人。文艺工作者要为工农兵服务，就必须到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，把立足点“移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来”，使自己的思想感情和世界观在三大革命运动中来一番脱胎换骨的改造。同工农兵群众相结合，熟悉工农兵的生活和思想，学习群众的语言，塑造工农兵的英雄形象，表现轰轰烈烈的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，创造无产阶级的新文艺。只有这样做，才能使文艺真正成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，以及一小撮反革命修正主义分子用两面派的手法猖狂地反对毛主席提出的文艺为工农兵服务的方向。他们提出“全民文艺”的口号来同毛主席的革命文艺路线相对抗。
    一九六二年，在《讲话》发表二十周年的时候，周扬、林默涵等人搞了一个假纪念，炮制了一篇《为最广大的人民群众服务》的大毒草，提出文艺要为包括资产阶级分子在内的“全体人民”服务，打出了“全民文艺”的反动黑旗。他们还公开地说“社会主义的文化就是全民的文化”。
    无产阶级的文艺能为资产阶级服务吗？社会主义的文化能是全民的文化吗？
    决不能。毛主席在《讲话》中早就斥责了这种荒谬的主张。
    “全民文艺”不是什么新鲜的论调，它不过是赫鲁晓夫“全民国家”、“全民党”在文艺上的翻版。世界上决不会有什么“全民”的文艺。文艺不是为无产阶级服务，就是为资产阶级服务。周扬、林默涵的“全民文艺”论，就是打着超阶级的幌子，反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对文艺为无产阶级政治服务，把文艺变成资本主义复辟的反革命工具。
    文化界无产阶级文化大革命中最重要的任务，就是要解决这个方向问题。
    不破不立。我们要在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开展大批判的运动中，大破他们的为反革命修正主义服务的文艺方向，大立我们的为工农兵服务的文艺方向，我们要以毛主席的《讲话》为武器，积极参加大批判运动，保卫无产阶级专政，保卫社会主义的江山。
    现在文化界有所谓“十七年和五十天之争”，争论的焦点是：现在文化界究竟是批判十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线呢？还是批判去年六七月间五十多天的资产阶级反动路线呢？这个争论引起了文化界同志们的广泛兴趣。其实，这两个问题都不是孤立的。而且，资产阶级反动路线也绝不只是五十天的事情。批判十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，同批判无产阶级文化大革命中的资产阶级反动路线是应该而且完全可以结合起来的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派提出的资产阶级反动路线，正是为了保护他们的反革命修正主义路线，当然也是为了保护他们十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线。我们既要批判十七年来的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，也要批判保护这条文艺黑线的资产阶级反动路线。反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总代表和资产阶级反动路线的提出者，都是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。当前大批判运动最重要的任务就是要把这个反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总代表和资产阶级反动路线的提出者——党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派批深、批透。只有这样，才能真正树立毛主席的革命文艺路线。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们！拿起笔来做刀枪，在这个无产阶级向资产阶级发起总攻击的时刻，勇敢地投入大批判运动，狠狠地打击敌人！
    第二，组织左派队伍，搞好本单位的斗批改。
    资产阶级统治我们文化界的现象再也不能继续下去了。十七年来被一小撮反革命修正主义分子所盘踞和控制的领导机关、文化团体、艺术院校，无产阶级革命派都要夺权。
    要组织浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，每个单位都要在斗争中逐步形成坚强的左派队伍。无产阶级革命派要在革命的大批判运动中，实现革命的大联合，同心协力搞好本单位的斗批改，把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，揭露他们的罪恶，肃清他们的流毒，把他们斗倒、斗臭、斗垮！
    要彻底批判资产阶级反动学阀和反动“权威”。
    一切需要夺权的地方都要建立新的真正革命的领导核心，来领导这支文化队伍。
    要按照毛主席在《讲话》里的指示，团结一切可以团结的力量，分清敌友我，区分两类矛盾。有些人拥护党、拥护社会主义、拥护毛主席，但说过一些错话、做过一些错事或写过一些不好作品，演过一些坏戏，对于他们不能打倒，要耐心帮助他们，教育他们，不能歧视他们。只要他们敢于检查错误，认识错误，我们无产阶级革命派就应该欢迎他们，团结他们，同他们一起进行斗批改。
    第三，抓创作，树样板，大立无产阶级之新。
    推翻资产阶级文艺，创立革命的无产阶级文艺，关键之一是抓创作。有了创作之新，才有文学、电影、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈、美术之新。根据目前无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，一般来说，每个文化单位一方面要进行本单位的斗批改，一方面要创作和排演现代的、革命化的为工农兵服务的文艺作品。
    要重视和发展工农兵创作，从工农兵群众中涌现出来的优秀文艺作品，反映了我国无产阶级文化革命时代的新风貌，一切革命的文艺工作者，都应该虚心地向他们学习。
    抓创作的关键又在于树立优秀的样板。样板的力量是巨大的，有了样板，才能说服人，才能彻底摧毁旧的东西，才能为新生事物开辟前进的道路。现代京剧《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》，革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》等是一批优秀的样板，是一批闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新的艺术典范，它们把革命的政治内容和完美的艺术形式统一起来了。这一批优秀艺术样板的出现，是毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的胜利。
    无产阶级需要的是现实的革命斗争和壮丽的革命理想相结合的优秀作品。这种优秀作品只有采取毛主席提出的革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义相结合的创作方法，才能获得成功。
    盲目地崇古、崇洋、崇修，“言必称希腊”的贾桂精神必须打倒。不信天，不信地，也绝不要信什么洋、名、古，只信工农兵，只信无产阶级，只信马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。什么古老的京剧、三十年代的电影，什么法国的文学、英国的莎士比亚，什么俄国的三个斯基、苏修的肖洛霍夫，统统不要迷信。古代的好东西，我们要批判地继承；外国的好东西，我们也要批判地吸收。但是要按照毛主席“古为今用”、“洋为中用”的指示去做，绝不可以让那些剥削阶级的玩艺儿牵着我们的鼻子走。
    看不起劳动人民，看不起无产阶级，迷信他人，低三下四地去迎合他人的需要，永远不会有什么出息。我们的震动世界的艺术珍品，不是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派膜拜的所谓“象佛一样”的洋专家从资产阶级那里转抄来的《天鹅湖》，而是我们自己的革命的芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》和《白毛女》。我们的《红色娘子军》和《白毛女》，起初并不是想演给全世界看的，但是它们却受到了全世界进步人类的欢呼。全世界的进步人类意想不到一个在西方世界里逐渐趋于没落的古老艺术，在东方世界却获得了新的青春生命。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他们的支持者把我们自己的艺术珍品说成是“土包子”，把外国落后的东西看成是九天的神明，吃了几片洋面包，便“数典忘祖”，“月亮也是外国的圆”，真不懂得他们还知不知道人间有羞耻事！
    我们要向京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐革命的奠基者和这些戏剧、舞蹈、音乐革命的先锋战士学习。京剧、芭蕾舞剧和交响音乐的革命是文艺战线上最艰巨的攻坚战。它们是这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的序幕。困难是很大的，斗争是很艰巨的。资产阶级和那些牛鬼蛇神的各种攻击、诽谤、流言蜚语、打击陷害，明枪、暗箭，接连不断地加到文艺战线先锋战士的头上。但是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》鼓舞着他们，他们毫不气馁，毫不畏难。为了从资产阶级手里夺取文艺的阵地，为了保卫毛主席的革命文艺路线，文化革命的尖兵在江青同志的率领下，持久地、连续地艰苦战斗。在克服了无数的困难和阻力以后，他们终于用战无不胜的毛泽东思想的武器在荆棘丛生的荒原上开拓出了一条光明的道路。他们勇敢顽强、坚韧不拔的革命战斗精神，是我们所有的文化战士的学习榜样。象京剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响音乐这样顽固的文艺堡垒都被我们的先锋战士攻破了，那么天下还有什么不可以攻克的文艺堡垒呢？文化大军的战士们，高举毛泽东思想的旗帜，信心百倍地勇敢前进吧！
    第四，开展群众性的文艺批评。
    毛主席教导我们：“文艺界的主要的斗争方法之一，是文艺批评”。文艺批评必须坚持政治标准第一，艺术标准第二的原则。一切危害无产阶级专政、危害社会主义革命事业的反动文艺思想和文艺作品，统统都要加以批判，决不能让这些毒草任意泛滥，毒害人民。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们的支持者，极力宣扬一种“无害”的谬论，胡说什么不管什么戏只要看了“能得到休息，使人高兴，就很好。”他们所说的“无害”完全是欺骗。他们公开主张可以随便放映的外国“无害”的电影，全都是宣扬资本主义、宣扬修正主义的作品。他们公开主张可以到处上演的“无害”的“剧目”，都是些宣扬剥削阶级、丑化劳动人民，以至含沙射影地反党反社会主义的作品。难道世界上真有那种所谓“无害”的作品吗？没有。毛主席在《讲话》里教导我们说：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”对你无害，对我就有害，哪有那么一种对于各个阶级都“无害”的文艺作品呢？难道那些资产阶级的、修正主义的腐朽文艺作品对劳动人民，特别是对年青一代所造成的毒害还嫌少了吗？党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子所推行的“无害”论，其用心是要用这块盾牌来阻挡群众的批评，以让各种反党反社会主义的大毒草贴上“无害”的标签推销给亿万革命人民，其目的就是用这些文艺作品麻痹和毒害劳动人民，以实现其和平演变、复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子还打着“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的幌子来抵制文艺批评，他们大肆叫嚷说“要放”，“要有放的自由”，要“兼容并包”，“自由竞赛”，“审查要宽”，“不要干涉过多”，“不要粗暴”，他们利用这些口号来为他们的毒草出笼开辟道路，为他们的资产阶级复辟的阴谋活动制造舆论。
    他们根本歪曲了毛主席“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，抽掉了这个伟大方针的阶级内容。百花齐放、百家争鸣是无产阶级的阶级政策，是为了巩固无产阶级专政，繁荣无产阶级文化服务的。毛主席在阐述这个政策的时候说过：“我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。不了解这种情况，放弃思想斗争，那就是错误的。凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。”毛主席又说，“放，就是放手让大家讲意见，使人们敢于说话，敢于批评，敢于争论”。而他们的所谓放，就是资产阶级的自由化，就是只准毒草放，不准香花放，只准右派鸣，不准左派争。这是要资产阶级专我们无产阶级的政，我们绝对不答应！我们就是要按照毛主席所教导的，把你们放出来的毒草统统锄掉。
    什么“不要粗暴”？真正粗暴的不是别人，真正粗暴的是资产阶级老爷们。什么“小人物的文章”呀，“党报不是辩论场所”呀，不都是这些人说的吗？言犹在耳，赖是赖不掉的。
    同志们！在资产阶级老爷们统治的地方，无产阶级连一棵新生的苗苗都不准生长，这还不粗暴？新生事物刚露一点头，他们就要疯狂地镇压，讽刺、谩骂、压制、打击、围剿、扼杀，无所不用其极，还有什么比这个更粗暴！
    京剧革命刚搞了一点样板，资产阶级老爷们就要压，就要破坏。压不住，破坏不了，就破口大骂，什么“京剧现代戏象白开水”呀，什么“话剧加唱”呀，罪名一大堆。正象我们京剧革命的先锋战士所说的，“这些人简直是无知！白开水有什么不好？有了白开水，才能泡茶，才能酿酒。没有白开水，活都活不了。‘话剧加唱’又有什么不好？从来的京剧都是话剧加唱。不说不唱，哪儿来的戏？”资产阶级的老爷们，你们为了反对京剧革命的一个样板，连体面都不要了，胡言乱语，瞎说一顿。这还不粗暴？什么“京剧现代戏象白开水”！什么“话剧加唱”！不服气吗？请拿最好的旧京戏同我们的样板戏比一比吧！旧京戏哪一点比得过我们？究竟是我们现代戏的工农兵演得美？还是旧京戏的老爷太太、少爷小姐演得美？旧京戏舞台上的帝王将相、才子佳人，从灵魂到形象都丑死了，比得上我们舞台上的工农兵吗？且不要说政治性、思想性了，就是艺术性也远远比不上我们。我们的现代戏哪有旧京戏的那种拖拖拉拉、松松垮垮的邋遢样子？
    旧京剧搞了一百三四十年，我们才搞了三四年。新的三四年打败了老的一百三四十年。革命触痛了资产阶级老爷们，你们的粗暴统治维持不下去了。于是反咬我们一口，说我们粗暴，真是混淆黑白，颠倒是非！我们哪里是什么粗暴？我们倒是太文雅了。你们的这一套还是统统收回去吧！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子，最害怕群众批评，他们骂我们的批评是“棍子”。毛主席说：凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护。他们害怕的，正是我们要提倡的。我们就是要发展群众性的文艺批评。如果把群众的批评说成是“棍子”，那末这是“无产阶级专打资产阶级、修正主义的‘钢棍子’、‘金棍子’”，宝贵得很。而且，还可以奉告资产阶级的老爷们，经过无产阶级文化大革命，这种“棍子”，以后还要大大发展。
    一定要打破文艺批评中的“专家”路线。把文艺批评当作知识分子的“象牙之塔”，由少数人垄断，这是完全错误的。
    群众的眼睛是雪亮的。文艺批评的武器应该交给广大工农兵群众去掌握。因为最关心无产阶级革命事业、最爱护无产阶级专政的是工农兵群众。只有发动全国亿万工农兵群众来检验文艺作品，才能铲除真正的毒草，保护真正的香花。只有发动全国亿万工农兵群众审查文艺作品，才能提高创作的质量，繁荣革命文艺的创作事业。
    群众性的文艺批评好得很，我们应当为它欢呼。
    同志们！史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，开辟了一个空前有利于无产阶级文艺大发展的新时代。剥削阶级腐朽的旧文化，在无产阶级文化大革命风暴的冲击下，土崩瓦解了。一个光辉灿烂的革命文化的新时代，到来了！
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级、两条路线的斗争是长期的、曲折的、复杂的，“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。”敌人在今后仍然要同我们进行复辟和反复辟的斗争。文化阵地处于阶级斗争的前线，斗争更为复杂和艰巨，我们在前进的道路上，还会遇到新的困难和阻力，但是，历史前进的车轮是不可抗拒的，威力无穷的毛泽东思想的阳光照耀着我们，任何困难和阻力都挡不住我们前进的步伐。
    同志们，新的胜利在等待着我们，让我们用伟大领袖的光辉著作武装自己的头脑，不断地改造自己，紧紧地跟着毛主席，紧紧地跟着革命的工农兵群众，不断革命，永远革命，为保卫伟大的无产阶级专政，为建设人类历史上最壮丽、最灿烂的无产阶级革命文化而奋斗！
    让一切逆历史潮流而动的反动派，在无产阶级的伟大胜利面前发抖吧！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
