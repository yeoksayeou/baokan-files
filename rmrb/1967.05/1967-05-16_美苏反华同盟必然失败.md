The anti-China alliance between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique is expanding from the political, economic, and cultural spheres into the military realm.

Following the Karlovy Vary meeting of European traitors, U.S. imperialism immediately announced the withdrawal of a large number of troops from Western Europe and vigorously advocated that the Soviet revisionist clique "reduce its military burden in the West" to deal with the "hostile neighbors" in the East. At the same time, U.S. officials openly promoted the establishment of a joint "international anti-missile system" to provide "some security guarantees" for the United States and the Soviet Union.

Which "hostile neighbors" does the U.S. want the Soviet revisionists to deal with? Who is the target of the U.S.-Soviet "anti-missile system"? It is clear that it is China.

Due to the counter-revolutionary collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, they have today transformed from enemies into allies. The "security guarantees" they seek is to "guarantee" the "security" of their counter-revolutionary conspiracy to cooperate between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and dominate the world. The biggest obstacle to this is China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely advances the world revolution. It is this common goal of anti-China, anti-people, and anti-revolution that drives them not only to transfer troops from Europe but also to attempt to use their missiles and nuclear weapons to threaten China.

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger, and Soviet modern revisionism is also a paper tiger. Even if they collude to form an anti-China military alliance, they will absolutely not intimidate the 700 million Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and they will absolutely not stop the great influence of the Chinese revolution. The powerful development of the Chinese people's strength and the continuous rise of the world revolutionary tide will inevitably cause the anti-China alliance of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to collapse completely, just like all the counter-revolutionary alliances in history.

### 美苏反华同盟必然失败

    美苏反华同盟必然失败
    美帝国主义和苏联修正主义集团的反华同盟，正在从政治、经济、文化领域扩展到军事方面。
    卡罗维发利欧洲工贼会议之后，美帝国主义立即宣布将从西欧撤退大量驻军，并且竭力鼓吹苏修集团“减轻它在西线的军事负担”，去对付东方“敌对的邻国”。与此同时，美国官方又公开宣扬要同苏联建立一个共同的“国际反导弹系统”，为美苏两国“提供某种安全保障”。
    美帝要苏修对付什么样的“敌对的邻国”？美苏两国“反导弹系统”究竟针对谁？不言自明，当然是中国。
    由于美苏的反革命勾结，它们今天已经从敌人变成了盟友。它们所要谋求的“安全保障”，就是要“保障”它们推行美苏合作、主宰世界的反革命阴谋的“安全”。而它们的最大障碍，就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、坚决推进世界革命的中国。正是这种反华、反人民、反革命的共同目标，促使它们不但从欧洲转移兵力，而且妄图进一步用它们的导弹核武器来威胁中国。
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”美帝国主义是纸老虎，苏联现代修正主义也是纸老虎。它们即使勾结起来建立反华军事同盟，也绝对吓不倒用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，绝对阻止不了中国革命的伟大影响。中国人民力量的强大发展和世界革命浪潮的不断高涨，必然会使美帝国主义和苏修领导集团的反华同盟，象历史上所有的反革命同盟一样，彻底垮台。
