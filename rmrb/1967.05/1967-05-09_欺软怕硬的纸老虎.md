From the shores of the Red Sea to the banks of the Mediterranean, the Arab people have recently launched wave after wave of anti-American sentiment.

The people of Yemen, after a fierce struggle, drove out more than a hundred CIA agents that the American imperialists had stationed in Yemen. The people of Syria have roared in condemnation of the American aggressors. The people of Lebanon are standing in readiness, preparing to resist the activities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet. Many Arab countries' public opinion and officials have recently condemned, one after another, the American imperialists' evil schemes of using Israel to invade the Arab people. The American imperialists' situation in the Middle East is like a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat it—it is getting worse and worse.

American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the Arab people. From Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy to today's Johnson, they have always regarded the Middle East as an important region for American imperialist expansion and aggression. Under the guise of "aid" and "friendship," they have been trying every means to infiltrate the political, economic, and military aggression of American imperialism into Arab countries, aiming to establish their new colonial rule in the Middle East.

However, the more evil deeds American imperialism commits, the more thoroughly its wolfish nature is exposed, and the more intense the Arab people's struggle against American imperialism becomes. This time, the people of Yemen caught the American imperialists' black hand stretching into Yemen, and with righteous indignation, they firmly pushed back all the pressures imposed by American imperialism, refusing to be intimidated. The American imperialists' spies had no choice but to lose their arrogance and slink away from Yemen with their tails between their legs. The true colors of American imperialism as an empty, bullying paper tiger have been exposed once again.

Of course, despite suffering heavy blows from the Arab people, American imperialism will not admit defeat and give up. For American imperialism, the Middle East, with its rich oil resources and strategic importance, is a region it must contest. It will surely continue to play tricks and hatch conspiracies, launching even more frenzied counterattacks against the Arab people. However, our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "Is American imperialism not very big? We have stood up to it, and it is nothing." No matter how vicious American imperialism is, as long as the Arab people unite closely and stand up to it, fight it, and fight to the end, they will surely defeat all the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism and achieve greater victories in the struggle to maintain national independence.

    欺软怕硬的纸老虎
    从红海之滨到地中海畔，阿拉伯人民最近掀起了一阵又一阵的反美浪潮。
    也门人民经过一场轰轰烈烈的斗争之后，赶走了美帝国主义设置在也门的一百多名间谍人员。叙利亚人民发出了声讨美国侵略者的怒吼。黎巴嫩人民正在严阵以待，准备反对美国第六舰队前去活动。许多阿拉伯国家的公众舆论和官方人士，最近也接二连三地谴责美帝国主义利用以色列侵略阿拉伯人民的罪恶勾当。美帝国主义在中东的处境，正象老鼠过街，人人喊打一样，越来越不好过了。
    美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人。从杜鲁门、艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪到今天的约翰逊，一向把中东当作美帝国主义扩张侵略的一个重要地区。他们打着“援助”的幌子，披着“友谊”的外衣，实际上是千方百计地想把美帝国主义的政治、经济和军事侵略势力打入阿拉伯国家，在中东地区建立自己的新殖民主义统治。
    但是，美帝国主义坏事干得越多，它的豺狼本性就暴露得越彻底，阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义的斗争也就越高涨。这次也门人民逮住了美帝国主义伸进也门的黑手，理直气壮地把美帝国主义施加的种种压力坚决顶了回去，硬是不买它的账，美帝国主义的特务们就只好威风扫地，夹着尾巴灰溜溜地滚出了也门。它那外强中干、欺软怕硬的纸老虎原形，又来了个活生生的大暴露。
    当然，美帝国主义尽管遭到阿拉伯人民沉重的打击，它是决不会老老实实地认输罢休的。对于美帝国主义来说，具有丰富的石油资源和重要战略地位的中东地区，是它的必争之地。它一定还会玩弄手段，施展阴谋，对阿拉伯人民进行更加疯狂的反扑。但是，我们伟大领袖毛主席说过：“美帝国主义不是很大吗？我们顶了他一下，也没有啥。”不管美帝国主义多么凶恶，阿拉伯人民只要紧密团结起来，同它顶，跟它斗，斗到底，就一定能够击败美帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，在维护民族独立的斗争中取得更大的胜利。
