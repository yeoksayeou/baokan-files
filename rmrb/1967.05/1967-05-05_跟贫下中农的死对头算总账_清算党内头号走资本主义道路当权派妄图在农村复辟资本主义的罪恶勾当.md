Over the past seventeen years, a small clique of revisionists and social scum, with the support of the top party official walking the capitalist road, have launched a full-scale, rampant attack on the proletariat. In rural work, they have spread a lot of poison. We must thoroughly purge their influence to ensure that Mao Zedong Thought occupies every ideological position in the countryside, and to build a new socialist countryside faster and better.

For thousands of years, Chinese peasants have suffered brutal exploitation and oppression from the landlord class, living a life worse than cattle. To rise up and liberate themselves, they waged a long and courageous struggle against the reactionary ruling class. Finally, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, they overthrew the three great mountains and freed themselves from exploitation and oppression. However, just as the peasants across the country were celebrating their liberation, the top party official walking the capitalist road shouted, "Long-term protection of the rich peasant economy" and advocated "four freedoms." By doing so, he was speaking for the landlords and rich peasants, deliberately intending for the poor and lower-middle peasants to remain as slaves to the landlords and rich peasants for a long time, and scheming to develop capitalist economics in the countryside. His intentions were so malicious!

The top party official walking the capitalist road stood on the side of the landlords and rich peasants, naturally opposing the poor and lower-middle peasants' path to socialism. Just as peasants across the country were organizing cooperatives under Chairman Mao's great call, this top party official walking the capitalist road directed his subordinates to shout, "The steps are too fast," "too reckless!" and began to slash cooperatives. Our most beloved and great leader, Chairman Mao, understands the poor and lower-middle peasants the best, cares for them the most, and trusts them the most. He gave a piercing criticism to those who opposed collectivization and gave a high evaluation of the poor and lower-middle peasants' socialist enthusiasm. Chairman Mao said: "The masses harbor a great socialist enthusiasm. Those who only know how to follow the rules in revolutionary times do not see this enthusiasm at all. They are blind, and in front of them is only darkness. Sometimes they even go to the extent of confusing right and wrong, black and white." Chairman Mao criticized these people as opportunists, as sufferers of "rightist stubbornness." With the advent of the high tide of agricultural collectivization, Chairman Mao, with his great concern, pointed out: "The poor are about to rise. The old system will perish, and the new system will be born." Indeed, in a very short time, peasants across the country, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, completed the socialist transformation of the countryside. The economy of landlords, rich peasants, and small peasant economy perished, and the collective economy of socialism was born.

What kind of vine produces what kind of fruit, what class speaks what words. The top party official walking the capitalist road always opposed Chairman Mao and opposed the poor and lower-middle peasants. During the period of people's communes, Chairman Mao's great call of "People's Communes are good" was like a spring thunder, shaking the whole country, and quickly a high tide of people's communes emerged. The top party official walking the capitalist road was terrified and hated it to death. Under his direction, his group ran out again shouting "People's Communes were established too early, and they are a mess," singing in tune with Khrushchev. But we poor and lower-middle peasants understand: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." No matter how the top party official walking the capitalist road and a small clique of revisionists shout, we still follow the path of "People's Communes are good" as indicated by Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." After the people's communes, during the three years of difficulty, the top party official walking the capitalist road, in response to domestic and foreign class enemies, vigorously advocated "three autonomies and one contract," promoting the restoration of capitalism. In some places, because of the black wind of "three autonomies and one contract," capitalism spread rampantly. It was not until the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962 that Chairman Mao put forward the great call to never forget class struggle, and in the countryside, launched a great socialist education movement, which severely struck the capitalist forces in the countryside.

It was also during this period that the top party official walking the capitalist road opposed Chairman Mao's teachings of "The serious problem is educating the peasants" and "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work," advocating a revisionist management policy in the operation and management of people's communes, promoting material incentives, attempting to dismantle the socialist collective economy, and obstructing peasants from mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

The top party official walking the capitalist road stubbornly insisted on a bourgeois reactionary stance. In the "Four Cleanups" movement of 1964, he again proposed a line that was "left" in form but right in essence, striking good cadres among the poor and lower-middle peasants, sabotaging the socialist education movement, and striking the poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiasm for the socialist path.

Countless facts show that the top party official walking the capitalist road has, for many years, consistently stood on the side of landlords and rich peasants. The evil deeds he has done are all for the purpose of pulling peasants onto the capitalist road, realizing his evil goal of restoring the capitalist system of "exploitation is meritorious."

However, this is a futile attempt. Chairman Mao said: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system, which is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the advance of the historical wheel, the revolution will inevitably occur, whether early or late, and will certainly be victorious." The truth is on Chairman Mao's side. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most. The plots and tricks of the top party official walking the capitalist road and a small clique of revisionists, such as "four freedoms," slashing cooperatives, "three autonomies and one contract," and so on, have all failed one by one. Their spread of fallacies such as "hiring workers to farm is legal and beneficial to the masses" have also been proven wrong one by one. Under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, peasants across the country have waged a struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, repelled the class enemies' repeated attacks, and achieved repeated victories. The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are invincible.

Our Dazhai Brigade is the one that has grown and prospered under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, in the struggle against a small clique of revisionists in the original provincial, municipal, and county committees supported by the top party official walking the capitalist road, against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and against all erroneous thoughts. We have never relaxed our struggle against them. We not only repelled the rampant attacks of class enemies and capitalist forces, struck various bourgeois thoughts, but also overcame the various difficulties brought by "Old Heaven" and conquered the severe droughts and floods, achieving bumper harvests year after year. Now, a new Dazhai has been initially built; especially the class consciousness of the commune members has been greatly improved. From Dazhai, we have seen the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, seen the brilliance of the general line, seen the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, and seen the superiority of the people's communes. This is something that no one can erase. After our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," 480,000 people from across the country and more than 50 countries around the world came to Dazhai to visit. What did they come to see? They came to see Mao Zedong Thought, to see the great material power generated by the spiritual power of Mao Zedong Thought, to see the power of the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. This is a heavy blow to the top party official walking the capitalist road and a small clique of revisionists. The facts of Dazhai and the facts of people's communes across the country prove: the poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to take the socialist road, and the poor and lower-middle peasants are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. For many years, the top party official walking the capitalist road has spread a lot of poison and engaged in evil activities in rural work, and now it is time for a thorough reckoning. We must hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, thoroughly criticize, expose, overthrow, and condemn him, and thoroughly purge all his influences!

    跟贫下中农的死对头算总账
    ——清算党内头号走资本主义道路当权派妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当
    陈永贵
    十七年来，一小撮修正主义分子和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，向无产阶级发动了全面的猖狂进攻。在农村工作中，他们也放了大量的毒。必须把他们的流毒彻底肃清，才能让毛泽东思想占领农村一切思想阵地，才能把社会主义新农村建设得更快更好。
    中国农民，几千年来遭受地主阶级的残酷剥削和压迫，过着牛马不如的生活。为了翻身解放，他们和反动统治阶级进行了长期英勇的斗争。终于在毛主席、共产党的领导下，推翻了三座大山，摆脱了剥削和压迫。可是，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，就在全国农民欢庆解放的时候，却大叫大嚷“长期保护富农经济”，提倡“四大自由”。他这样做，就是为地主、富农说话，就是存心要贫下中农长期给地主、富农当牛做马，蓄意在农村发展资本主义经济，其用心是多么恶毒！
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，站的是地主、富农的立场，当然就要反对贫下中农走社会主义道路。正当全国农民在毛主席的伟大号召下，积极组织合作社的时候，这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，指使他手下的一伙，跳出来叫嚷：“步子走的太快了”，“太冒进了！”动手大砍合作社。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，最了解贫下中农，最关心贫下中农，最相信贫下中农，他对那些反对合作化的人提出了一针见血的批评，对贫下中农的社会主义积极性给了极高的评价。毛主席说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。那些在革命时期还只会按照常规走路的人们，对于这种积极性一概看不见。他们是瞎子，在他们面前出现的只是一片黑暗。他们有时简直要闹到颠倒是非、混淆黑白的程度。”毛主席批评这些人是机会主义者，是“右倾顽症”患者。随着农业合作化高潮的出现，毛主席他老人家又以巨大的关怀，指出：“穷人要翻身了。旧制度要灭亡，新制度要出世了。”果然，全国农民，特别是贫下中农，在很短的时间内，就完成了农村的社会主义改造。地主、富农经济和小农经济制度灭亡了，社会主义的集体经济制度出世了。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，老是和毛主席相对抗，与贫下中农作对。在人民公社化时期，毛主席发出的“人民公社好”的伟大号召，象一声春雷，震动了全国，很快地出现了人民公社化高潮。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，怕得要命，恨得要死。在他的指使下，他的那一伙又跑出来叫嚷什么“人民公社办早了，办糟了”，和赫鲁晓夫唱一个调子。但是，我们贫下中农懂得：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”不管党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮修正主义分子怎样叫喊，我们还是照着毛主席所指引的“人民公社好”的道路前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”人民公社化以后，在三年困难时期，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，与国内外阶级敌人相呼应，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”，推行资本主义复辟。在一些地方，因为刮起了“三自一包”这股黑风，资本主义泛滥。直到一九六二年党的八届十中全会上，毛主席提出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大号召，在农村中开展了伟大的社会主义教育运动，才狠狠地打击了农村的资本主义势力。
    也是在这个时期，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，和毛主席“严重的问题是教育农民”“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导相对抗，在人民公社的经营管理工作中，鼓吹修正主义经营方针，大搞物质刺激，妄图瓦解社会主义集体经济，阻碍农民掌握毛泽东思想。
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地坚持资产阶级反动立场，在一九六四年的“四清”运动中，又提出了一条形“左”实右的反动路线，打击贫下中农的好干部，破坏社会主义教育运动，打击贫下中农坚持社会主义道路的积极性。
    无数事实说明，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，多年来一贯地站在地主、富农的立场上，他干的一件件、一桩桩坏事，都是为着把农民拉到资本主义道路上去，实现他复辟“剥削有功”的资本主义制度的罪恶目的。
    但是，螳螂挡车，这是痴心妄想。毛主席说：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”真理在毛主席一边。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派和一小撮修正主义分子所策划的什么“四大自由”、大砍合作社、“三自一包”等阴谋诡计一个一个都失败了，他们所散布的什么“雇工种地是合法的，对群众也有好处”等等谬论，也一个一个地破产了。全国农民在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，开展了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，打退了阶级敌人一次又一次的进攻，取得了一次又一次的胜利。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民，是任何力量也阻挡不住的。
    我们大寨大队，就是在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在同党内头号走资本主义道路当权派所支持的原省、地、县委内一小撮修正主义分子，同地、富、反、坏、右分子，同一切错误思想的斗争中不断成长壮大的。我们从来没有放松过对他们的斗争。我们不仅击退了阶级敌人和资本主义势力的猖狂进攻，打击了形形色色的资产阶级思想，也克服了“老天爷”给我们带来的种种困难，战胜了特大的旱涝灾害，获得了连年丰收。现在，一个崭新的大寨已初步建成；特别是社员的阶级觉悟，有了很大的提高。从我们大寨看到了光焰无际的毛泽东思想的无比的威力，看到了总路线的光辉，看到了大跃进的成果，看到了人民公社的优越性。这是任何人都抹煞不了的。我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出“农业学大寨”的号召之后，全国有四十八万人，全世界有五十多个国家的朋友，来大寨参观访问。他们来看什么呢？是看毛泽东思想，是看毛泽东思想精神力量所产生的巨大的物质力量，是看总路线、大跃进、人民公社三面红旗的威力。这对党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，对一小撮修正主义分子，是当头一棒。大寨的事实证明，全国农村人民公社的事实证明：贫下中农是要坚决走社会主义道路的，贫下中农无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想。多少年来，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在农村工作中所放的大量的毒，所干的罪恶活动，现在已经到了彻底清算的时候了。我们要高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他的一切流毒！
