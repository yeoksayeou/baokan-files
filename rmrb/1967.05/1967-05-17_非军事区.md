The Demilitarized Zone

According to the agreement reached at the 1954 Geneva Conference on the cessation of hostilities in Vietnam, the area within five kilometers on either side of the temporary military demarcation line is designated as the demilitarized zone. The temporary military demarcation line starts from slightly south of the 17th parallel north, at the mouth of the Ben Hai River just north of Highway 9, follows this river to the village of Bo Ho Su, and then continues west along the 17th parallel to the Vietnam-Laos border. According to the final declaration of the Geneva Conference, this military demarcation line is temporary and not a political or territorial boundary.

For over a decade, the United States has consistently violated the Geneva Agreement regarding the temporary military demarcation line and the demilitarized zone. The United States has cut off communication between the people on the north and south sides of the temporary military demarcation line, illegally sent armed forces into the demilitarized zone, suppressed and persecuted the people south of the demilitarized zone, and provoked the people north of the demilitarized zone. Since July 1966, the United States has repeatedly dispatched B-52 bombers to bomb the demilitarized zone, conducted large-scale "sweeps" in the southern part of the demilitarized zone, and dropped chemical poisons and carried out savage bombings in the northern part. Since February 22 of this year, the U.S. aggressor forces have also used long-range artillery to shell Vietnam's northern region from the south. U.S. destroyers have repeatedly ventured north of the 17th parallel, using artillery to attack densely populated coastal areas in Vietnam's northern region. The U.S. imperialists have even boasted about occupying the demilitarized zone and sending troops to invade Vietnam's northern region. The U.S. imperialists have also continuously sent armed spies to infiltrate the demilitarized zone to carry out sabotage activities in Vietnam's northern region. Recently, U.S. publications have openly admitted that U.S.-South Vietnamese joint special forces, which include U.S. military personnel and maintain close ties with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, frequently infiltrate Vietnam's northern region to gather intelligence and notify U.S. aircraft for bombing. The recent powerful offensive launched by the military and people of Quang Tri-Thua Thien has severely punished the U.S. imperialists' war escalation activities. (Accompanying picture)

    非军事区
    根据一九五四年日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定规定，临时军事分界线两侧不超过五公里地区的距离内为非军事区。临时军事分界线东起北纬十七度线稍南，九号公路稍北的边哈河河口，沿着这条河流到波胡素村，再从这里沿十七度线往西直到越南、老挝边境。按照日内瓦会议最后宣言规定，这条军事分界线是临时性的，而不是政治的或领土的边界。
    十多年来美国一贯破坏日内瓦协议中关于临时军事分界线和非军事区的规定。美国切断了临时军事分界线南北两地人民的来往，非法向非军事区派遣武装力量，镇压和迫害非军事区南面人民，对非军事区北面人民进行挑衅。一九六六年七月以来，美国曾经多次出动B—52型轰炸机轰炸非军事区，对非军事区南部不断发动大规模的“扫荡”，对非军事区北部撒放化学毒药和进行野蛮的轰炸。从今年二月二十二日以来，美国侵略军更从越南南方用远程大炮轰击越南北方。美国驱逐舰还不断深入到十七度线以北，用大炮袭击越南北方沿海居民稠密区。美帝国主义还叫嚣说：要占领非军事区，并派兵侵入越南北方。美帝国主义还不断派遣特务武装偷越非军事区，对越南北方从事破坏活动。最近美国报刊也直言不讳地供认，有美国军事人员参加的，同美国中央情报局保持密切联系的美国—南越联合特种部队，经常潜入越南北方收集情报，通过U—2间谍飞机通知美机进行轰炸。最近广治—承天军民发动的强大攻势，有力地惩罚了美帝扩大战争的活动。（附图片）
