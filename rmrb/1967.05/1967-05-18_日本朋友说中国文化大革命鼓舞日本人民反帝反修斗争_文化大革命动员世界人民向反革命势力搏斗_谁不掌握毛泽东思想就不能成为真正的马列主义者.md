The brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong guide the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China from one victory to another, greatly inspiring the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people of Japan.

Japanese revolutionary friend Fukuda Seigyo told a Chinese journalist: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, plays a pivotal role in the world revolutionary movement. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage of Marxism-Leninism. Those who do not grasp Mao Zedong Thought cannot become true Marxist-Leninists, and cannot correctly understand the world revolution. Whether one can uphold the banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone for distinguishing true revolutionaries and true Marxist-Leninists from false ones."

Fukuda said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has promoted the great development of the revolutionary struggle of the Japanese people and has also promoted the great leap forward in the world revolutionary cause."

Japanese revolutionary friends told the Chinese journalist: "The Japanese people have the courage to wage uncompromising struggles against American imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries because they have the great Mao Zedong Thought. It is Mao Zedong Thought that gives the Japanese revolutionary people unlimited courage and confidence. It is Mao Zedong Thought that inspires the Japanese revolutionary people to unite and wage anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles, and firmly believe that they can achieve complete victory."

Not long ago, after returning from a visit to China, the famous figure of the Japan-China friendship movement, Koya Shoyo, said: "In dealing with all problems, one must take Mao Zedong Thought as the highest criterion and act according to Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle against revisionism, only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding ideology can one have a truly Marxist-Leninist stance."

He said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is a declaration of war by the revolutionary people of the world against reactionary forces on a global scale." He said: "The current situation is very clear, who our enemies are and who our friends are are plain to see. Those who frantically oppose Mao Zedong Thought, attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and slander the heroic Red Guards are who? They are American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, the Japanese reactionary government, and the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party. But they will all end up lifting a rock only to drop it on their own feet."

Japanese famous cultural figure Nakajima Takeshiro highly praised the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution taking place in China, saying: "With the direct leadership of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, this is the greatest happiness for the seven hundred million Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world."

Not long ago, after visiting China, Japanese revolutionary friend Sumikuma Takaharu told the Chinese journalist: "We must closely follow the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and firmly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, taking the great Mao Zedong Thought as the highest directive. In the struggle against the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party, we must continuously draw strength from the Chinese Cultural Revolution."

A Japanese friend named Imizu from Osaka Prefecture, while praising the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a revolution personally led by the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao Zedong. This is a struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pushing the reactionary bourgeois line, and attempting to turn socialist China into a capitalist country. I firmly believe that this handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road will be smashed." He said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will certainly achieve great victory, and the People's Republic of China will certainly become an even more solid and unbreakable socialist fortress."

    日本朋友说中国文化大革命鼓舞日本人民反帝反修斗争
    文化大革命动员世界人民向反革命势力搏斗
    谁不掌握毛泽东思想就不能成为真正的马列主义者
    据新华社东京电　光辉的毛泽东思想指引着中国无产阶级文化大革命从一个胜利走向又一个新胜利的大好形势，大大地鼓舞着日本革命人民的斗争意志。
    日本革命朋友福田正义对中国记者说：“毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在世界革命运动中，起着划时代的作用。毛泽东思想是划时代的马克思列宁主义。谁不掌握毛泽东思想，就不能成为一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，就不能正确理解世界革命。能不能坚持毛泽东思想的旗帜，是真假革命和真假马克思列宁主义的试金石。”
    福田说：“中国无产阶级文化大革命，促进了日本人民革命斗争的大发展，也促进了世界革命事业的大跃进。”
    日本革命朋友告诉中国记者说：“日本人民有勇气敢于同美帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派作不调和的斗争，就是因为有伟大的毛泽东思想。正是毛泽东思想，给日本革命人民以无限勇气和信心，是毛泽东思想鼓舞着日本革命人民联合起来，进行反帝反修斗争，并坚信自己可以获得完全胜利。”
    不久以前访华归国的日中友好运动著名人士古谷庄一郎说：“处理一切问题都必须以毛泽东思想为最高准则，按照毛泽东思想办事。在反修斗争中，只有以毛泽东思想为指导思想，才会有真正的马克思列宁主义的立场。”
    他说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，就是在全世界范围内，发动世界革命人民，向反革命势力宣战。”他说：“现在的形势很清楚，谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友，一目了然。疯狂反对毛泽东思想，攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命、诽谤英雄的红卫兵的是什么人呢？是美帝国主义，是苏联现代修正主义，是日本反动政府和日共修正主义分子。但是，他们都将搬起石头打自己的脚。”
    日本著名文化界人士中岛健藏高度赞扬（中国）正在进行的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，他说：“有伟大舵手毛主席的直接领导，这是七亿中国人民和世界革命人民的最大幸福。”
    不久以前访问过中国的日本革命朋友隅冈隆春对中国记者说：我们一定要紧紧跟上中国无产阶级文化大革命的发展，紧紧掌握毛泽东思想，以伟大的毛泽东思想作为最高指示。在反对日共修正主义分子的斗争中，不断地从中国文化大革命中汲取力量。
    大阪府的一位叫今泉的日本朋友在赞扬中国文化大革命时说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命是伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛泽东主席亲自领导的革命。这是一场反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派推行资产阶级反动路线、企图把社会主义中国蜕变为资本主义的斗争。我坚决相信，党内这一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一定会被粉碎。”他说：“中国的无产阶级文化大革命，必将获得伟大胜利，人民中国必将成为更加巩固的牢不可破的社会主义堡垒。”
