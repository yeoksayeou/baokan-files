The revolutionary modern Peking opera "Shajiabang" is a brilliant play that radiates the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. From the play, we can see that the people of Shajiabang were able to gain liberation, and the traitors and pseudo-military forces that oppressed and bullied the people of Shajiabang were annihilated. Ultimately, this is because the people had a powerful people's army personally created and led by Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there can be no people's everything." This is an unshakable truth. Only with "armed revolution" can we "oppose armed counter-revolution," and only then can we thoroughly eliminate the class enemies, and the revolutionary people can truly rise up. The revolutionary masses of Shajiabang understand that the people's army is their lifeline, their own flesh and blood, the spark of revolution, and the reliable guarantee of victory. Therefore, even at the cost of their own lives, they must transfer the 18 wounded and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army to the reed marshes. In times of great difficulty, the old peasant Sandelai still remembers the wounded and sick soldiers of the New Fourth Army, and lets her son Qilong risk his life to deliver grain and medicine to the soldiers. With the support of the revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought, our army can be invincible.

Our great commander-in-chief Mao Zedong personally created the People's Liberation Army of China, which is a great army that serves the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly and never leaves the masses. In "Shajiabang," Commander Guo Jian'guang and the wounded soldiers he leads are like 18 tall pines standing on the mountain peak. They are in the reeds but their hearts are with the people. In times of severe shortage of food and medicine, they think of quickly understanding the enemy situation, preparing to go out and eliminate the enemy, so that the people of Shajiabang can be liberated as soon as possible. My brother, the model soldier Xie Qin, followed Chairman Mao's teachings in his life. He said: "The people are the water, the army is the fish. Fish cannot survive without water. As long as the people need it, we must rush to do it and serve the people." In a flood rescue operation, Xie Qin risked his life to save the people and ultimately sacrificed his own life.

On March 14, our class responded to the call of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao and organized a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team to go to Dazhai Brigade in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, to support agriculture, continuing the spirit of serving the people exemplified by Xie Qin. Thousands of supports, sending Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest support; thousands of cares, caring politically is the greatest care. We, together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dazhai, grasp revolution and promote production, hold study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works, sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and hold meetings to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Wherever we go, the military and the people unite as one family.

In the past, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we relied on the unity of the military and the people to overthrow the three big mountains oppressing us and seize power; today, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, we still rely on the unity of the military and the people to consolidate the socialist system and hold the great power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. At this decisive moment of struggle between the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, we must also rely on the unity of the military and the people, support the military and love the people, to thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and ensure that our country will forever be a red land illuminated by the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought!

    看革命现代京剧《沙家浜》有感
    山西省革命委员会委员  解放军某部谢臣班班长  谢起
    革命现代京剧《沙家浜》是一出闪耀着光焰无际的毛泽东思想的好戏。从戏里可以看到，沙家浜人民所以能够获得解放，压迫和欺凌沙家浜人民的汉奸伪军所以灭亡，归根结底，就是因为人民有了一支毛主席亲自缔造和领导的强大的人民军队。毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”这是颠扑不破的真理。有了“武装的革命”，才能“反对武装的反革命”，才能彻底消灭阶级敌人，革命人民才能够真正翻身。沙家浜的革命群众懂得，人民的军队是自己的命根子，是亲骨肉，是革命的火种，是胜利的可靠保证。所以，哪怕牺牲自己的生命，他们也一定要把新四军十八名伤病员转移到芦苇荡。在十分困难的时刻，老贫农沙奶奶还是念念不忘新四军伤病员，让儿子七龙冒着生命危险给子弟兵送粮送药。有了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民的拥护，我们的军队便能无敌于天下。
    我们的伟大统帅毛主席亲自缔造的中国人民解放军，是全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的、一刻也不脱离群众的伟大军队。在《沙家浜》中，郭建光指导员和他所带领的伤病员真是挺立在高山之巅的十八棵青松，他们身在芦荡，心向人民。在十分缺乏粮食、药品的时候，他们想到的是迅速了解敌情，准备出荡，消灭敌人，使沙家浜人民早日获得解放。我的哥哥爱民模范谢臣同志生前就是完全遵照毛主席的教导去做的，他说过：“人民是水，军队是鱼，鱼离开水就不能生存。只要人民需要，就要抢着去做，为人民服务。”在一次抗洪抢险中，谢臣同志为了抢救人民的生命，临危不惧，最后牺牲了自己的生命。
    三月十四日，我们班响应伟大统帅毛主席的号召，组织了毛泽东思想宣传队，到山西省昔阳县大寨大队支农，继续发扬谢臣同志的爱民精神。千支援万支援，送去毛泽东思想是最大的支援；千爱护万爱护，从政治上关心是最大的爱护。我们同大寨广大贫下中农一起抓革命，促生产，一起开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，一起唱毛主席语录歌，一起开会批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。我们每到一个地方，军民团结得就象一家人。
    过去，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，依靠军民团结推翻了压在头上的三座大山，打下了江山；今天，在无产阶级专政的条件下，我们仍然要靠军民团结，巩固社会主义制度，掌好无产阶级专政的大权。在无产阶级革命派向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的决战时刻，同样要依靠军民团结，拥军爱民，才能彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，才能保证我们的天下，永远成为光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀的无产阶级的红色天下！
