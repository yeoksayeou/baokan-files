Chairman Mao says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, it is revolution. To destroy, one must argue, and arguing is constructing. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, who supports Peng Zhen's drafting of the "Report Outline," dares to sing a different tune from Chairman Mao, claiming that "without construction, it is impossible to achieve true and thorough destruction." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a total counterattack against the rampant attacks by bourgeois representatives over the past seventeen years; it is a great revolution of destroying the old and establishing the new. The "Outline" emphasizes construction before destruction, which is to prevent the bourgeoisie from destroying, to prevent the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought, and to prevent us from carrying out the Cultural Revolution. Their intentions are so malicious! This exposes the long-term conspiracy of this group of counter-revolutionary revisionists against Mao Zedong Thought. Vice Chairman Lin Biao advocates for workers, peasants, and soldiers to carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, but they slander the workers, peasants, and soldiers for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism," attempting to suppress the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with these three black sticks. In essence, they are afraid that workers, peasants, and soldiers will grasp Mao Zedong Thought, expose their true selves, rebel against them, seize their power, overthrow them, and usurp their politics.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized the masses, with everyone wielding the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, each person becoming a critic, verbally and in writing, sweeping away old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, and promoting new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits. We are breaking down selfishness and establishing selflessness, upholding the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all positions, and changing the entire social spiritual outlook. We are excited to see that from cities to villages, everyone reads Chairman Mao's books and uses Mao Zedong Thought to fight. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, truly known to every household and understood by every child. Their study of Chairman Mao's works has never been as diligent and serious as it is today: "Food can be skipped, sleep can be skipped, but Chairman Mao's works must be studied." They use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, transform everything, and promote everything. "What conforms to Mao Zedong Thought will last forever, and what does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought will not be tolerated for a moment." This has become the social norm. This is a remarkable change, a guarantee to prevent deviation, and a long-term plan for a hundred, a thousand, and ten thousand years of revolution.

The fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of power. Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental principle of seizing power, the soul of holding power, and the guide to using power. The sky is the sky of Mao Zedong Thought, the earth is the earth of Mao Zedong Thought, and people are those armed with Mao Zedong Thought. If we turn the entire army and the whole country into a school of Mao Zedong Thought, we will be able to overcome any difficulty, climb any peak, defeat any enemy, create any miracle, and make greater contributions to humanity.

    欢呼毛泽东思想的大普及
    干事　刘进亭
    毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持彭真炮制的《汇报提纲》，却竟敢和毛主席唱对台戏，胡说什么“没有立，就不可能达到真正、彻底的破”。无产阶级文化大革命就是对资产阶级代表人物十七年来猖狂进攻的总反击，是破旧立新的大革命。《提纲》强调先立后破，就是对资产阶级不准破，对毛泽东思想不准立，不准我们搞文化大革命。其用心何其毒也！这是这伙反革命修正主义分子长期以来反毛泽东思想的阴谋的大暴露。林彪副主席倡导工农兵开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，他们就污蔑工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”，妄图用这三根黑棍把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动压下去，说穿了，就是害怕工农兵掌握毛泽东思想，识破他们的原形，造他们的反，夺他们的权，革他们的命，专他们的政。
    无产阶级文化大革命把群众发动起来，人人奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，个个都是批判家，口诛笔伐，对旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯来了一个大扫除，对新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯来了一个大普及。大破私字，大立公字，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，改变整个社会精神面貌。我们兴奋的看到，从城市到乡村，人人读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想去进行战斗，毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，真是家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。他们对毛主席著作的学习从来没有象今天这样刻苦，这样认真，“饭可以不吃，觉可以不睡，毛主席著作不学不行”。他们用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切。“符合毛泽东思想的就叫它万古长存，不符合毛泽东思想的就叫它片刻不留。”这已成为社会风气。这是一个了不起的变化，这是保证不走岔路，永远革命的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。毛泽东思想是夺权的根本，掌权的灵魂，用权的指南。天是毛泽东思想的天，地是毛泽东思想的地，人是用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，把全军、全国都办成毛泽东思想大学校，我们就任何困难都能克服，任何险峰都能攀登，任何敌人都能战胜，任何奇迹都能创造，我们就会对人类做出更大的贡献。
