Beijing and Guangzhou revolutionary masses held demonstrations today to resolutely support the just struggle of Hong Kong compatriots. They vowed to demand blood debt from the British imperialists. More than twenty countries and regions of foreign friends demonstrated in front of the British representative office.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the capital held a larger-scale demonstration and protest march today, angrily denouncing the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong against our Hong Kong compatriots. In the past three days, more than a million people have demonstrated in front of the British representative office in China. The demonstrators solemnly declared: With a powerful socialist motherland as a backing, with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and with the support of 700 million people across the country, the struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against persecution will definitely achieve final victory!

In recent days, the British representative office in China has been surrounded by a surging crowd. Revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary masses from the streets have poured in like a tide. By tonight, the powerful demonstration and protest march had reached its peak. The walls in front of the British representative office were covered with big-character posters, big-character slogans, protest letters, and cartoons denouncing the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities.

Revolutionary workers from various industrial systems in the capital expressed their greatest concern and strongest support for the Chinese workers in Hong Kong who are currently engaged in the struggle against persecution. They angrily declared that the heinous crimes of the Hong Kong British authorities in brutally suppressing the Chinese workers and compatriots in Hong Kong must be settled, and we revolutionary workers must demand blood debt from the British imperialists!

More than 200 members of the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune traveled from the suburbs, 40 li away, to the British representative office today to angrily denounce the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities in persecuting Hong Kong compatriots. The Red Guards and revolutionary students participating in the demonstration and protest march emphasized that "learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought is the sacred and inviolable right of Hong Kong patriots!" "Whoever opposes Hong Kong patriots learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought must be overthrown!" The Red Guards pointed out in their protest letter: The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The British imperialists are afraid of Hong Kong compatriots learning and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, but the wings of a crow cannot cover the sun, and the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought is absolutely unblockable.

Tonight, more than twenty countries and regions of international friends in Beijing came to the British representative office. They held up placards written in Chinese and various languages, saying "Down with British imperialism," "Strongly condemn British crimes," and "Support the just struggle of Chinese workers in Hong Kong." They handed a strongly worded protest statement to the British diplomatic officials. In the protest statement, they said: We condemn the Hong Kong British authorities for attempting to resist the growing influence of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution and Mao Zedong Thought; we condemn the British government for colluding with American imperialism to turn Hong Kong into a land, sea, and air military base for invading Vietnam. The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately and unconditionally accept the solemn demands of the Chinese government!

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Guangzhou on the 17th, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in Guangzhou today to angrily denounce the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities. In the evening, nearly 100,000 revolutionary workers, peasants, cadres, and Red Guards held a grand protest rally and demonstration march on Yuexiu Mountain. On Yuexiu Mountain, the revolutionary masses shouted, "We will be the strong backing of Hong Kong compatriots!" "Down with American and British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The slogans echoed through the night sky. A representative of the revolutionary workers warned the Hong Kong British authorities at the meeting, pointing out that the Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has become even stronger through the cultural revolution. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries in the world dare to oppose the great Chinese people and will not have a good end, awaiting them is complete failure and annihilation!

The representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Guangzhou said at the meeting, "We must strongly oppose imperialism, strongly oppose revisionism, and strongly oppose all reactionaries. If the Hong Kong British authorities continue to cause trouble, they will not escape annihilation." The representative of the Red Guards of Guangzhou's universities and colleges said at the meeting, "We, the Guangzhou Red Guards, firmly support the struggle of Hong Kong students and patriots against persecution."

Many returned overseas Chinese, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, and their families participated in the meeting with great emotion. They expressed their firm support for the statement of our country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and firmly supported the just struggle of Chinese workers and residents in Hong Kong. The meeting passed the strongest protest telegram against the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities.
