Mao Zedong taught us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are unavoidable. Without them, it is impossible to complete the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to gain power." The reactionary film *The Story of Wu Xun* is a vicious attack on Chairman Mao's great teachings and serves the political interests of the exploiting classes and their reactionary regime.

In the late Qing Dynasty, the Chinese people waged a tenacious struggle against foreign invaders and the feudal ruling class. At that time, peasant revolutionary wars were sweeping the country. In this period of great revolutionary upheaval, Wu Xun not only did not touch a single hair of the feudal economic base and its superstructure but enthusiastically propagated feudal culture and vigorously maintained the crumbling Qing Dynasty's rule, running errands for the feudal landlord class. This feudal corpse in the film preaches the negation of class struggle, the rejection of revolution, and the rejection of seizing power. It tells people that as long as they live like Wu Xun, there will be a way out, and the working people can rise up, without the need for resistance or struggle. At the same time, the film attributes the fundamental reason for the oppression and exploitation of peasants in feudal society to "illiteracy" and vigorously promotes the fallacy that "only by reading books can one have a good life," "can rise up," and "can go to heaven," thereby deceiving the masses, inciting people's hearts, and advocating the path of reformism to "save the country through education."

In feudal society, the working people suffered heavy oppression and cruel exploitation. At the same time, they were completely deprived of the right to enjoy various cultural educations. For the working people to rise up, they must first overthrow the exploitative system of "man eating man." Only by gaining political liberation and economic liberation can they achieve complete cultural liberation. If one merely attempts to seek liberation through "reading" and "literacy" without mobilizing the masses to wage a revolutionary struggle to overthrow the feudal ruling class, and instead uses reformism to "save the country through education" to replace the revolutionary struggle of the masses, it will only cause the working people to be permanently enslaved, actually helping the exploiting class to oppress and exploit the working people.

The film shamelessly beautifies the feudal landlord class and reverses the enemy relationship. It praises the butcher Yang Shufang, who brutally suppressed the peasant uprising led by Song Jingshi, as a "respected" and "enlightened gentleman." It even carefully arranged a scene where the landlord Guo Fen eloquently declares, "What you eat, drink, wear, and live in—all come from the peasants," turning a class enemy with heinous crimes into a revolutionary who represents the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Even more reactionary is that his words were met with nods of approval and unanimous agreement from all the landlords and gentry present, except for Zhang Juren. This completely erases the sharp class antagonism between peasants and landlords, blurs class boundaries, and turns the landlord class into a representative of peasant interests, thereby attempting to make the oppressed class place their hopes for self-liberation on the "enlightenment" and "wisdom" of the ruling class, rather than fundamentally overthrowing the exploitative system of "man eating man."

At the same time, the film viciously distorts and slanders the peasant revolutionary wars. It uses the distorted image of Zhou Da to allude to the peasant uprising led by Song Jingshi and uses the so-called "one literary, one martial" to compare Zhou Da's path with Wu Xun's path. The film depicts Zhou Da's insurgent army as a group of "rioters" who kill and burn, viciously attacking the great peasant revolutionary movement and distorting the revolutionary heroes of the peasant uprising. The film maliciously portrays the outcome of peasant wars in history as "utter failure" and uses the failure of peasant wars as a foil to sing the praises of Wu Xun's extremely reactionary "begging to promote education." This reactionary propaganda that slanders the peasant revolutionary struggle and Chinese history is absolutely intolerable!

Chairman Mao highly evaluates the great peasant uprisings and peasant wars in China, pointing out: "In Chinese feudal society, only this class struggle of the peasants, peasant uprisings, and peasant wars are the true driving force of historical development." To negate the peasant revolutionary wars and negate the oppressed classes using violent means to overthrow the rule of the oppressing class is the most shameless class surrenderism!

Just as Wu Xun surrendered to the feudal landlord class and vigorously maintained the exploitative system of "man eating man," the number one capitalist-roader in power within the party, soon after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, actively promoted the line of national and class surrenderism of the so-called "peaceful democratic new stage," opposing revolutionary armed struggle. He vigorously advocated "solving domestic issues through political means," attempting to hand over the people's armed forces, which countless martyrs had exchanged their lives and blood for, to the U.S. imperialists and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek, who were sharpening their knives.

Just as *The Story of Wu Xun* fiercely opposed the peasant revolutionary wars and vigorously maintained the old system, he was also frightened by the cannon fire of the War of Liberation, shouting "the revolutionary situation is developing too fast," "it would be better to slow down," attempting to stop the wheels of history and halt the revolution. After liberation, he never forgot about capitalism; he vigorously praised the so-called "progress" and "glory" of the capitalist system, frantically advocating the "long-term" preservation and development of the rich peasant economy, and vigorously opposing the three great transformations to socialism, attempting to restore capitalism in China.

It is very clear that the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, just like Wu Xun, is a faithful servant and running dog of the landlord and bourgeoisie, a faithful defender of the exploitative system, and a sworn enemy of the revolutionary people.

    打倒“武训精神”，埋葬投降主义
    靳青
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”反动影片《武训传》正是恶毒攻击毛主席的这一伟大教导，而替剥削阶级的政治利益和他们的反动政权服务的。
    清朝末年，中国人民同外国侵略者和封建统治阶级，进行了坚强不屈的伟大斗争。当时的农民革命战争风起云涌。在这风云突变的伟大革命时期，武训不但不去触动封建经济基础及其上层建筑的一根毫毛，反而狂热地宣扬封建文化，极力维护行将崩溃的清王朝的统治，为封建地主阶级奔走卖命。这具封建僵尸在影片里进行着否定阶级斗争、不要革命、不要夺取政权的政治说教。它告诉人们，只要象武训那样去生活，就会有出路，劳动人民就能翻身，根本不必去反抗，去斗争。与此同时，影片把农民在封建社会中受压迫受剥削的根本原因归结为由于“不识字”，并大肆宣扬只有“念了书才有好日子过”，就可以翻身，就可以“升天堂”等谬论，借以蛊惑人心，欺骗群众，鼓吹“教育救国”的改良主义道路。
    在封建社会里，劳动人民受到沉重的压迫和残酷的剥削。同时，他们也完全被剥夺了享受各种文化教育的权利。劳动人民要翻身，就必须首先推翻人吃人的剥削制度。只有获得政治上的解放、经济上的翻身，才有可能获得文化上的彻底翻身。而如果仅仅企图通过“念书”、“识字”来求翻身解放，却不动员人民群众进行推翻封建统治阶级的革命斗争，甚至用“教育救国”的改良主义来取代人民群众的革命斗争，那就只能使劳动人民永远陷于被奴役的地位，实际上也就是帮助剥削阶级对劳动人民进行压迫、剥削。
    影片肆意美化封建地主阶级，颠倒敌我关系。它把血腥镇压宋景诗农民起义的刽子手杨树坊吹捧为“德高望重”的“开明士绅”，甚至还精心安排了一个场面，让地主郭芬慷慨陈词，说什么“你吃的、喝的、穿的、住的——都是从庄稼人身上刮得来的”，把一个罪恶累累的阶级敌人打扮成了一个代表贫下中农利益的革命者。更加反动的是，他的这句话竟然博得了当时在座的除张举人之外的所有地主豪绅们的点头称是，齐声赞同。这里完全抹杀了农民和地主尖锐的阶级对立，模糊了阶级界限，把地主阶级美化成农民利益的代表，从而企图让被压迫阶级把自身解放的希望寄托在统治阶级的“开明”、“明智”上面，而不从根本上去推翻人吃人的剥削制度。
    与此同时，影片对农民革命战争进行了恶毒的丑化和污蔑。它用被歪曲了的周大的形象来影射宋景诗农民起义，还用所谓“一文一武”来将周大的道路和武训的道路进行了对比。影片把周大的起义军描写成一群杀人放火的“暴徒”，肆意攻击伟大的农民革命运动，丑化农民起义的革命英雄。影片狠毒地把历史上的农民战争的结局全部说成“一败涂地”，并以农民战争的失败作反衬来歌颂武训极其反动的“行乞兴学”的成功。这种污蔑农民革命斗争，污蔑中国历史的反动宣传，是绝对不能容忍的！
    毛主席对中国伟大的农民起义和农民战争作了高度的评价，他指出：“在中国封建社会里，只有这种农民的阶级斗争、农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”否定农民革命战争，否定被压迫阶级通过暴力的手段推翻压迫阶级的统治，这就是最无耻的阶级投降主义！
    同武训投降封建地主阶级、极力维护人吃人的剥削制度一样，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派早在抗日战争胜利后，就积极推行所谓“和平民主新阶段”的民族投降主义和阶级投降主义路线，反对革命的武装斗争。他极力鼓吹“国内问题由政治方面来解决”，企图把无数先烈用生命和鲜血换来的人民武装，双手拱让给磨刀霍霍的美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石。
    同《武训传》疯狂反对农民革命战争、竭力维护旧制度一样，他也被解放战争的??炮声吓破了胆，叫嚷“现在革命形势发展太快”，“不如慢一点”，妄图阻止历史车轮前进，使革命就此止步。他在解放后念念不忘资本主义，他极力称颂资本主义制度的所谓“进步”和“光荣”，拚命鼓吹“长期”保存和发展富农经济，极力反对社会主义三大改造，妄图在中国复辟资本主义。
    非常清楚，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和武训一样，都是地主和资产阶级的忠实奴才和走狗，都是剥削制度的忠实卫道士，都是革命人民的死敌。
