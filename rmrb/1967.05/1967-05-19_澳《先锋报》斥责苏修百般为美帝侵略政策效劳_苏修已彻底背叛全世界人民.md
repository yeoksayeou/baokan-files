The Australian "Vanguard" published an editorial on May 11 pointing out that U.S. imperialism is suffering increasingly heavy defeats in the Vietnam War and is becoming more isolated in the world.

The editorial said: "Today, two slogans are often heard in the world: 'Long live Chairman Mao!' and 'Yankees, go home!' These two slogans express the deepest wishes and hopes of the people of the whole world."

The editorial pointed out that it is precisely in Vietnam that the main enemy of the people of the whole world, U.S. imperialism, is suffering a crushing defeat; it is precisely the people's war thought pointed out by Chairman Mao that is causing the main enemy of the people of the whole world, U.S. imperialism, to suffer.

The editorial went on to say that as the failure of U.S. imperialism becomes more and more obvious, the contradictions within the U.S. ruling class are becoming sharper, the opposition of the American people is becoming stronger, and the "allies" of the United States are further distancing themselves from it. The editorial said that all these situations will continue to develop.

The editorial emphasized: "It is precisely in this situation that the Soviet revisionist renegades are eagerly serving U.S. imperialism."

The editorial said: "They are now providing conveniences for the United States to withdraw troops from Europe. They support all the puppet governments propped up by the United States, even Chiang Kai-shek. They also support the 'Malaysia' propped up by U.S.-British imperialists and the Indonesian fascists." The editorial said: "When U.S. imperialism reveals all the aggressive nature of imperialism, they advocate peaceful coexistence with U.S. imperialism... All this is a thorough betrayal of the people of the whole world by the Soviet revisionists."

    澳《先锋报》斥责苏修百般为美帝侵略政策效劳
    苏修已彻底背叛全世界人民
    新华社墨尔本电　澳大利亚《先锋报》十一日发表社论指出，美帝国主义在侵越战争中遭到日益惨重的失败，它在世界上变得更加孤立了。
    社论说：“今天世界上有两个常听到的口号：‘毛主席万岁！’和‘美国佬滚回去！’这两个口号表达了全世界人民最深切的愿望和希望。”
    社论指出，恰恰是在越南，全世界人民的主要敌人美帝国主义正在遭到惨败；恰恰是毛主席指出的人民战争思想正在使全世界人民的主要敌人美帝国主义遭殃。
    社论接着说，由于美帝国主义的失败愈来愈明显，美国统治集团内部矛盾也愈来愈尖锐，美国人民的反对也愈来愈强烈了，美国的“盟国”对它也进一步疏远了。社论说，这一切情况将继续发展。
    社论强调指出：“正是在这种情况下，苏修叛徒们正在起劲地为美帝国主义效劳。”
    社论说：“他们现在为美国从欧洲撤军提供方便。他们支持美国扶植的一切傀儡政府，甚至蒋介石，他们也支持。他们还承认美英帝国主义者所扶植的‘马来西亚’，支持印尼法西斯。”社论说：“在美帝国主义露出帝国主义所有的侵略本性的时候，他们就鼓吹与美帝国主义和平共处……所有这一切都是苏修对全世界人民地地道道的背叛。”
