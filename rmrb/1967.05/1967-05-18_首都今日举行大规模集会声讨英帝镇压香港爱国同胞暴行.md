The British authorities in Hong Kong, in collusion with American imperialism, have brazenly launched a series of anti-China actions, repeatedly deploying large numbers of armed military police and thugs to brutally suppress Hong Kong patriots. This fascist atrocity has sparked immense outrage among the 700 million Chinese people. Revolutionary masses from various sectors in Beijing will hold a large-scale rally this afternoon to denounce the British imperialists' suppression of Hong Kong patriots. The Central People's Broadcasting Station will begin broadcasting the live proceedings of the rally at 15:50 today using the first program frequency. Beijing Television and Beijing People's Broadcasting Station will also broadcast the rally simultaneously.
