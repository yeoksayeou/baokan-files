	Various countries' public opinion has angrily condemned the anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes committed by Indonesian reactionaries. The frenzied anti-China actions of Indonesian reactionaries will not end well.

	Hanoi, May 8 (Xinhua) — The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on April 29, condemning the Indonesian authorities for repeatedly dispatching military and police forces, along with mobs, to surround and attack the Chinese Embassy, illegally abducting and detaining the Chinese Consul-General in Jakarta, and unjustly expelling the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires and Consul-General. The statement pointed out that the aforementioned actions by the Indonesian authorities blatantly violate the basic principles of international relations and go against the fundamental interests of the Indonesian people. The statement emphasized that the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly support the principled stance of the Government of the People's Republic of China, demanding that the Indonesian authorities immediately cease all anti-China and persecution of overseas Chinese actions, and take effective measures to ensure the safety of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and its staff in accordance with international law and international conventions.

	According to Xinhua's Tirana dispatch, the Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on April 30, angrily condemning the heinous anti-China crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionaries.

	The commentary said that the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique, on the one hand, uses terrorist methods to massacre the Indonesian people, and on the other hand, increasingly participates in the imperialist and revisionist schemes of the U.S. and the Soviet Union against the Chinese people and the peoples of various Asian countries. The facts clearly show that the more financial and military aid the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists provide to Indonesia, the more savage and shameless the provocations of the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique against China become.

	The commentary pointed out that the Indonesian reactionaries and their masters, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, will never achieve their despicable goals, just as in the past. The Indonesian people will not be deceived by their wicked plots, and the Chinese people will, as always, give their shameless provocations the appropriate response.

	Hanoi, May 8 (Xinhua) — The Liberation Radio of South Vietnam recently published a commentary, strongly condemning the barbaric actions of the Indonesian reactionaries against Chinese diplomatic personnel and the savage persecution of overseas Chinese. The commentary pointed out that the recent serious anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents instigated by the Indonesian reactionary authorities are "part of their long-standing conspiracy, in accordance with American intentions, to oppose the People's Republic of China and persecute overseas Chinese."

	The commentary said: "Persecuting overseas Chinese who have long lived in Indonesia, who have fought alongside the Indonesian people against colonialism and imperialism, and who have made contributions to Indonesia's national independence and national construction, is extremely unpopular." The commentary said that the Indonesian authorities' persecution of overseas Chinese only benefits colonialism and imperialism. The commentary demands that the Indonesian authorities must stop their hostile actions against the People's Republic of China and the persecution of Indonesian overseas Chinese.

	According to Xinhua's Vientiane dispatch, the Pathet Lao Radio recently published a commentary, strongly protesting the frenzied anti-China and savage massacre of overseas Chinese by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia.

	The commentary said that the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique, since the counter-revolutionary coup in 1965, has on the one hand savagely massacred the Indonesian people, and on the other hand, sold out to U.S. imperialism. At the same time, it has frenziedly implemented policies against the People's Republic of China and persecuted overseas Chinese in Indonesia. This is to please U.S. imperialism in order to gain more dollars. The commentary said that all the Lao people firmly support the principled stance of the Chinese government in safeguarding the interests of overseas Chinese and international law.

	The commentary expressed confidence that the Indonesian people, with their long history of struggle and experience, will never tolerate the fascist rule of the Suharto-Nasution right-wing military clique.

	According to Xinhua's Phnom Penh dispatch, the Cambodian newspaper "New Telegraph" published a commentary on April 29, condemning the heinous anti-China and anti-people crimes committed by the Indonesian reactionary regime.

	The commentary pointed out: The Indonesian reactionaries have gone mad in their anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, indiscriminately shooting Indonesian people, fully exposing their anti-China and anti-people true colors.

    评论指出，印尼反动派及其主子美帝、苏修象过去一样，永远也达不到它们卑鄙的目的。印尼人民不会被他们的险恶阴谋所欺骗，中国人民也将一如既往地给他们的无耻挑衅以应有的回击。
