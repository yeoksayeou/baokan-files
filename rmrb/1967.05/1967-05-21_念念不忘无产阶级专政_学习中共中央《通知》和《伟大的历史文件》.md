There is no doubt that the most fundamental question for any revolution is the question of state power. Who holds the power, this point decides everything.

Never Forget the Dictatorship of the Proletariat
— Studying the CPC Central Committee's Notice and the Great Historical Document
Ren Lixin

The great Marxist-Leninist historical document, the Notice issued by the CPC Central Committee on May 16, 1966, was personally directed by our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao comprehensively summarized the historical experiences of the international proletarian revolution and the proletarian dictatorship, and the historical experiences of proletarian dictatorship in China over the past seventeen years since liberation. He brilliantly and creatively solved a series of problems in contemporary proletarian revolution, solving the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. This has advanced Marxism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great milestone in the history of the development of Marxism-Leninism.

The core and essence of Marxism-Leninism is the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whether or not one acknowledges the dictatorship of the proletariat is the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and old and new revisionists.

Marx and Engels critically absorbed the essence of human knowledge, summarized the basic experiences of the international workers' movement at that time, transformed socialism from utopianism to scientific socialism, and established the theory of scientific socialism. The main point and soul of Marxism is the violent seizure of power, the proletarian revolution, and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Marx once pointed out: "Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat."

However, apart from the Paris Commune, Marx and Engels did not witness the realization of the socialist revolution. They could not systematically solve the problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat at that time.

After the deaths of Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin developed Marxism, solving a series of problems of the proletarian revolution in the era of imperialism, and the theoretical and practical problems of achieving the dictatorship of the proletariat in one country. Thus, Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism.

Lenin personally led the great October Socialist Revolution, using revolutionary violence to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Russian bourgeoisie and establishing the first socialist state in the world, the Soviet Union, where the proletariat held power.

Lenin saw that after the proletariat seized power, the defeated bourgeoisie was even stronger than the proletariat and constantly attempted to restore the old order. At the same time, small producers continuously gave rise to new capitalists and bourgeoisie, threatening the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, to deal with these counter-revolutionary threats and defeat them, it was necessary to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat over a long period. There was no other way.

However, due to Lenin's untimely death, he did not have the chance to solve the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration in practice.

Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist. He solved a large number of counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the party, such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Radek, Bukharin, Rykov, and others. His flaw was that he did not acknowledge in theory that classes and class struggle existed throughout the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The outcome of the revolution had not been finally decided, and if things went wrong, there was the possibility of a bourgeois restoration. In the year before his death, he had already noticed this, saying that socialist society had contradictions, and if things went wrong, these contradictions could become antagonistic.

Soon after Stalin's death, the first socialist state, the Soviet Union, was usurped by the Khrushchev revisionist clique, which implemented a capitalist restoration. In some other socialist countries, similar things happened. This placed a very important question before the proletariat of the whole world: after the proletariat seized power, if things went wrong, there was always the danger of losing power and a capitalist restoration.

Our great leader Chairman Mao fully paid attention to and deeply studied the experiences and lessons of the entire history of the Soviet Union, discovered the laws and characteristics of class struggle under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, systematically and comprehensively proposed the theory that contradictions, classes, and class struggle still existed in socialist society, and creatively developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

In 1957, in his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao pointed out: "In our country, although the socialist transformation, in terms of ownership, has been basically completed ..., the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie is just beginning to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. 'The struggle between socialism and capitalism in the ideological realm in our country will take a fairly long time to resolve.'"

In September 1962, at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee, Chairman Mao once again issued a great battle call to the whole party and the people of the whole country: "Never forget class struggle."

In May 1963, in the draft "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Several Questions in Current Rural Work" personally directed by Chairman Mao, he warned the whole party: "Class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation are three great revolutionary movements for building a powerful socialist state. They are the reliable guarantee for Communist Party members to avoid bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism, and stand unshakable. They are the reliable guarantee for the proletariat to unite with the broad masses of laborers and implement democratic dictatorship. Otherwise, if we allow the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and ghosts and monsters to all come out, and our cadres do not pay attention, and many of them even cannot distinguish between enemies and friends, collude with each other, are corrupted and infiltrated by the enemy, are split and disintegrated, are pulled out and brought in, and many workers, peasants, and intellectuals are also dealt with by the enemy in both hard and soft ways, if we handle things like this, then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years, or even a few dozen years, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

In January 1965, in the "Twenty-three Articles" personally directed by Chairman Mao, it was clearly pointed out: "The focus of the movement is to rectify those in power who are taking the capitalist road within the party."

In the Notice of the CPC Central Committee issued on May 16, 1966, personally directed by Chairman Mao, he taught us: "Representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and change the proletarian dictatorship into a bourgeois dictatorship. Some of these people have been exposed by us, some have not, and some are still being trusted by us and are being cultivated as our successors, such as the character of Khrushchev. They are now sleeping by our side. All levels of party committees must pay full attention to this."

In this series of teachings, Chairman Mao clearly told us: After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class struggle is still long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense. In socialist society, all class struggles are still focused on the issue of power. The proletariat must consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and develop the socialist system; the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement a capitalist restoration. This struggle between restoration and anti-restoration is mainly manifested in the struggle between the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals and the representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road are the main and most dangerous enemies who want to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and are the main targets of the revolution.

Why, in socialist society, is the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, and the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line, mainly manifested in the struggle between the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals and the handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road?

This is because, in our country, the dictatorship of the proletariat is the dictatorship of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers over the extremely small number of class enemies. The proletariat has a powerful state machine, especially a powerful People's Liberation Army, and is not afraid of the bourgeoisie's rebellion. It is very difficult for the bourgeoisie to launch an armed uprising from below to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, they have to mainly use the tactic of "Monkey King entering the belly" and the method of "pulling out and bringing in" to infiltrate into the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat and seize various levels of leadership, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat from within.

This is because, in our country, the proletariat has grasped the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Class enemies are afraid of the sunlight of truth and generally do not dare to openly raise the black flag to oppose the party and socialism. They often disguise themselves as Marxists-Leninists, waving the red flag to oppose the red flag, and using the signboard of the Communist Party to engage in anti-party and anti-socialist evil deeds. The handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road are precisely trying to use these counter-revolutionary methods, in collaboration with the international imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary subversive conspiracy activities, to achieve the evil goal of usurping the party, usurping power, and usurping the military, and restoring capitalism.

Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the danger of capitalist restoration is multi-faceted, and various reactionary forces are coordinated. Domestically and internationally, domestically is the main issue. Within the party and outside the party, within the party is the main issue. Among the upper and lower levels, the upper level is the main issue. That is to say, the danger of capitalist restoration mainly comes from the handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, especially the handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road.

Fortresses are most easily breached from within. "It is easy to dodge a visible arrow, but a hidden arrow is hard to guard against." The Khrushchev who is sleeping by our side is a hundred or a thousand times more dangerous than an enemy who is openly armed. Representatives of the bourgeoisie have infiltrated into our leadership organs and become those in power who are taking the capitalist road. They are everywhere, seizing party power, state power, and military power. They also occupy and control the ideological and cultural front, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. They want to unite to carry out subversion and create chaos. Although they are few in number, their political energy is great. Their resistance is much greater than their population ratio. This handful of revisionists form factions, recruit followers, and use their authority and the gold signboard of Communist Party members to deceive and mislead many people. We must never let down our guard. If their conspiracies succeed, the mountains and rivers we have won with our blood and lives will change color.

The serious lessons of capitalist restoration in the Soviet Union and some other socialist countries also fully prove this.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao is the most reliable guarantee to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure that our party and state will never change color. It is the most reliable guarantee for us to gradually transition from socialism to communism. This cultural revolution is the greatest innovation in the history of the international communist movement and is Chairman Mao's greatest contribution to the international proletariat in theory and practice.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The outcome of the revolution, who wins and who loses, will be decided over a very long historical period. If things go wrong, capitalist restoration will be possible at any time. All party members and the people of the whole country should not think that one or two, three or four cultural revolutions will bring eternal peace. We must pay attention and never let down our guard.

We must fully estimate that the class enemies will never be willing to admit defeat and will not easily retire from the historical stage. Our struggle with them will never be a one-time solution. Even after this cultural revolution, they will continue to use the method of pulling out and bringing in to find their agents within the revolutionary ranks. Therefore, no matter how complicated things are, we must never forget about power. We must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must continue to mobilize and unite hundreds of millions of people to carry out the great criticism and struggle against the handful of those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road to the end, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    毫无疑问，任何一个革命的最主要的问题都是国家政权问题。政权在哪一个阶级手里，这一点决定一切。
                            列宁
    念念不忘无产阶级专政
    ——学习中共中央《通知》和《伟大的历史文件》
    任立新
    我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是一个伟大的马克思主义的历史文件。毛主席全面地总结了国际无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史经验，总结了中国解放十七年来无产阶级专政的历史经验，天才地创造性地解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。这就把马克思主义推进到一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段。这是马克思列宁主义发展史上一个伟大的里程碑。
    马克思列宁主义的核心，它的精髓，就是无产阶级专政。承认不承认无产阶级专政，是马克思列宁主义者和新老修正主义者的分水岭。
    马克思和恩格斯批判地吸取了人类知识宝库中的精华，总结了当时国际工人运动的基本经验，把社会主义从空想变为科学，创立了科学社会主义理论。马克思主义的主要之点，它的灵魂，是暴力夺取政权，是无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。
    马克思曾经指出：“在资本主义社会和共产主义社会之间，有一个从前者变为后者的革命转变时期。同这个时期相适应的也有一个政治上的过渡时期，这个时期的国家只能是无产阶级的革命专政。”
    但是，除了巴黎公社而外，马克思和恩格斯没有亲眼看到社会主义革命的实现。他们当时不可能系统地解决无产阶级专政的问题。
    马克思和恩格斯逝世以后，列宁和斯大林发展了马克思主义，解决了帝国主义时代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在一个国家内实现无产阶级专政的理论和实践问题。这样，马克思主义就发展到了列宁主义阶段。
    列宁亲自领导了伟大的十月社会主义革命，用革命暴力推翻了俄国资产阶级的反动统治，建立了世界上第一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家苏联。
    列宁看到了无产阶级夺取政权以后，被打败的资产阶级甚至比无产阶级还要强大，时时企图复辟，同时小生产者不断生长新的资本主义和资产阶级，威胁无产阶级专政，因此要对付这些反革命威胁，并且战胜它，必须在长时期里强化无产阶级专政，舍此没有第二条路。
    但是，由于列宁逝世过早，所以没有来得及在实际上解决在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的问题。
    斯大林是个伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他在实际上解决了很大一批钻进党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物，例如托洛茨基，季诺维也夫，加米涅夫，拉狄克，布哈林，李可夫之流。他的缺点是在理论上不承认在无产阶级专政整个历史时代社会上存在阶级和阶级斗争，革命的谁胜谁负没有最后解决，弄得不好，资产阶级就有复辟之可能。在他临死的前一年，他已觉察到了这一点，说是社会主义社会存在矛盾，弄得不好，可能使矛盾变成对抗性的。
    斯大林逝世后不久，第一个社会主义国家苏联，被赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了党和国家的领导权，实行资本主义复辟。在其他一些社会主义国家里，也发生了这种事情。这就在全世界无产阶级面前，尖锐地提出了一个十分重大的问题：无产阶级夺取政权以后，弄得不好，随时都有丧失政权、复辟资本主义的危险。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，充分注意和深刻研究了整个苏联历史的经验教训，发现了无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争的规律和特点，系统地、全面地提出了社会主义社会中仍然存在矛盾、阶级、阶级斗争的理论，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说。
    一九五七年，毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部光辉著作中指出：“在我国，虽然社会主义改造，在所有制方面说来，已经基本完成……，但是，被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。”
    一九六二年九月，毛主席在党的八届十中全会上再一次向全党和全国人民发出了千万不要忘记阶级斗争的伟大战斗号召。
    一九六三年五月，毛主席在他亲自主持制定的《中共中央关于目前农村工作中若干问题的决定（草案）》中告诫全党：“阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，是建设社会主义强大国家的三项伟大革命运动，是使共产党人免除官僚主义、避免修正主义和教条主义，永远立于不败之地的确实保证，是使无产阶级能够和广大劳动群众联合起来，实行民主专政的可靠保证。不然的话，让地、富、反、坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐跑了出来，而我们的干部则不闻不问，有许多人甚至敌我不分，互相勾结，被敌人腐蚀侵袭，分化瓦解，拉出去，打进来，许多工人、农民和知识分子也被敌人软硬兼施，照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    一九六五年一月，在毛主席亲自主持制定的《二十三条》中明确地指出：“运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。
    毛主席在他亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》中教导我们说：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    毛主席在这一系列教导中清楚地告诉我们：在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，阶级斗争仍然是长期的、曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。在社会主义社会中，一切阶级斗争仍然集中在政权的问题上，无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，发展社会主义制度；资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。这种复辟与反复辟的斗争，集中表现为广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子同混进无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物的斗争。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，则是颠覆无产阶级专政的最主要最危险的敌人，是革命的主要对象。
    为什么在社会主义社会里，无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的两条路线斗争，集中表现为广大工农兵、革命干部和革命知识分子同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争呢？
    这是因为，在我国，无产阶级专政是无产阶级和广大劳动人民对占人口极少数的阶级敌人的专政。无产阶级拥有强大的国家机器，特别是有强大的人民解放军，不怕资产阶级造反。资产阶级要由下而上发动武装暴乱来推翻无产阶级专政，那是很困难的。因此，他们不得不主要用“孙悟空钻进肚皮去的战术”，用“拉出去，打进来”的办法，千方百计地钻到无产阶级专政机构内部来窃取各级领导权，妄图从内部颠覆无产阶级专政。
    这是因为，在我国，无产阶级掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，阶级敌人害怕真理的阳光，一般地不敢公开打出黑旗来反党反社会主义。他们往往乔装打扮成马列主义者的样子，打着“红旗”反红旗，挂着共产党的招牌来干反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派正是妄想用这种反革命手法，配合国际上帝修反的颠覆阴谋活动，达到篡党、篡政、篡军，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，资本主义复辟的危险是多方面的，各种反动力量是互相配合的。国内国外，国内是主要的。党内党外，党内是主要的。上层下层，上层是主要的。这就是说，资本主义复辟的危险性，主要来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，尤其是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    堡垒是最容易从内部攻破的，“明枪易躲，暗箭难防。”睡在我们身旁的赫鲁晓夫，要比明火执仗的敌人危险百倍千倍。资产阶级代表人物混进我们的领导机关，成了走资本主义道路的当权派。他们到处伸手，抓党权，抓政权，抓军权。他们还盘踞和控制思想文化阵地，为复辟资本主义制造舆论。他们要联合起来搞颠覆，闹大乱子。他们人数不多，但政治上的能量很大。他们的反抗力量要比他们的人口比例大得多。这一小撮修正主义分子结党营私，招降纳叛，利用他们的职权和共产党员的金字招牌，欺骗和蒙蔽了不少人。我们千万不要失去警惕。如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们用鲜血和生命换来的江山，就会改变颜色。
    苏联和其他一些社会主义国家资本主义复辟的严重教训，也充分证明了这一点。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，就是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，使我们党和国家永不变色的最可靠的保证，使我们从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的最可靠的保证。这场文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动史上的最伟大的创举，是毛主席在理论和实践上对国际无产阶级的最伟大的贡献。
    毛主席教导我们：革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。全体党员，全国人民，不要以为有一二次、三四次文化大革命，就可以太平无事了。千万注意，决不可丧失警惕。
    我们必须充分地估计到，阶级敌人是绝不会甘心失败的，是不会轻易地退出历史舞台的。我们同他们的斗争绝不可能是一劳永逸的，即使是经过这场文化大革命，他们还会继续用拉出去打进来的办法，在革命的队伍内寻找自己的代理人。所以，无论怎样千头万绪，也不要忘记政权。我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。我们一定要继续发动和团结亿万群众，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的大批判、大斗争进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
