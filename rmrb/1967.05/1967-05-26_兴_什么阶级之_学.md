Chairman Mao said: "In China, there is imperialist culture, ... and there is semi-feudal culture, which reflects semi-feudal politics and semi-feudal economy. Anyone who advocates the worship of Confucius, the study of classics, the promotion of old ethics and old ideas, and the opposition to new culture and new ideas are representatives of this kind of culture. Imperialist culture and semi-feudal culture are very close brothers; they form a reactionary alliance in the cultural field to oppose China's new culture."

Wu Xun did not touch the feudal economic base and its superstructure at all, but instead enthusiastically promoted feudal culture. The school he founded with money extorted from peasants was entirely for the service of the feudal ruling class. The teachers were scholars, holders of the imperial examination degrees, and those who had passed the special imperial examinations. They taught the Four Books, Five Classics, and Eight-Legged Essays. The students were the children of landlords, rich peasants, and merchants. Later, to satisfy the merchants' demands, he reluctantly ran a few years of "primary classes," and the students were mostly from wealthy families.

The film "The Life of Wu Xun," however, praises such a school, which maintains the political power of the landlord class and protects the feudal means of exploitation, to the skies. Isn't this astonishing!

Actually, it is not surprising. The Khrushchev of China is precisely an active advocate of this kind of "education." He only promotes bourgeois culture along with Confucianism.

The Khrushchev of China repeatedly praises the "work-study" system in capitalist countries, saying how good it is. He personally distributed articles from the reactionary propaganda of the American magazine published in the "Central Daily News" of the Kuomintang bandits to relevant units in China to "trial-run." He also vigorously advocates the capitalist "dual-track system" of the so-called "two educational systems, two labor systems." In his view, the experiences of "Western Europe, England, France, America, etc." have "great achievements in raising the cultural level of the Chinese people" and should be followed, letting students "hear nothing outside the window, concentrate on studying the classics," and "learn the beautiful teachings of our country's sages that are useful to us." Where does the Khrushchev of China want to "raise" the Chinese people to?

The Khrushchev of China attempts to cultivate a "new type of person," who is "different from workers and different from peasants." They are the future "factory directors, party secretaries, mayors, county magistrates, etc." Chairman Mao teaches us: We should cultivate "laborers who are socially conscious and cultured." These laborers are the workers and peasants who create history. The Khrushchev of China attempts to use the bourgeois method of "education" to cultivate revisionist seeds, laying the social foundation for his restoration of capitalism.

    “兴”什么阶级之“学”
    闻宜炳
    毛主席说：“在中国，有帝国主义文化，……又有半封建文化，这是反映半封建政治和半封建经济的东西，凡属主张尊孔读经、提倡旧礼教旧思想、反对新文化新思想的人们，都是这类文化的代表。帝国主义文化和半封建文化是非常亲热的两兄弟，它们结成文化上的反动同盟，反对中国的新文化。”
    武训根本不去触动封建经济基础及其上层建筑的一根毫毛，反而狂热地宣传封建文化。他用从农民身上榨取来的钱所办的学校，完全是为封建统治阶级服务的。教员是进士、举人和拔贡，教的是四书、五经、八股文。学生是地主、富农、商人的子弟。后来为了满足商人们的要求，勉强办了几年“蒙班”，上学的也多是富户。
    电影《武训传》却把这样的为了维护地主阶级的政权、保护封建剥削的生产关系的“义学”捧上了天，这岂非咄咄怪事！
    其实并不奇怪，中国的赫鲁晓夫正是这种“兴学”的积极倡议者，只不过他鼓吹的是资产阶级文化还加上孔孟之道而已。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，一再吹嘘资本主义国家的“勤工俭学”制度如何如何好，他还把蒋匪帮的《中央日报》刊载的美国杂志上鼓吹美国大学“半工半读”的反动宣传文章，亲自批发有关单位在中国“试办”。他又极力宣扬资本主义“双轨制”的所谓“两种教育制度，两种劳动制度”。在他看来，“西欧英、法、美……等的经验”，“对提高中国人民的文化水平上是有很大成绩的”，应当照办下去，让学生“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专攻圣贤书”，“学习我国历代圣贤优美的对我们有用的遗教”。他要把中国人民“提高”到哪里去呢？
    中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图培养一种“新的人”，这种人“和工人不一样，和农民不一样”，他们是未来的“厂长、党委书记、市长、县长等等”。毛主席教导我们说：我们要培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”。这个劳动者就是创造历史的工人、农民。中国的赫鲁晓夫企图通过资产阶级的“兴学”办法，培养出修正主义的苗子，为其复辟资本主义奠定社会基础。
