February 1966 was an extraordinary month, a month of intense struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie within our party. During this time, two fundamentally opposing documents emerged. One was Peng Zhen's "Report Outline," and the other was the "Summary of the Conference on Army Literary and Art Work Held at the Instruction of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing."

The "Report Outline" was meticulously crafted by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, from February 3 to 7 in Beijing. This outline is a counter-revolutionary program that opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, a program that opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat and aims to restore capitalism, a thoroughly revisionist program.

The "Summary of the Conference" was drafted under the guidance of Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing, who convened the conference on army literary and art work in Shanghai from February 2 to 20. After extensive discussions by the participants and three revisions by Chairman Mao, it was finalized. This summary is a direct counter to the "Report Outline," an important document for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and crushing the restoration of capitalism, a Marxist-Leninist document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The two documents represent the banners of two opposing classes. The "Report Outline" is the black flag of the bourgeoisie's ferocious attack on the proletariat. The "Summary of the Conference" is the red flag of the proletariat's counterattack against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party.

The two documents are orders from two command centers representing different classes. The "Report Outline" is a counter-revolutionary order issued by the bourgeoisie command center, led by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party. It calls on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and all ghosts and monsters to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, protect their usurped political, ideological, and cultural leadership, and fight to the death to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. The "Summary of the Conference" is a revolutionary order issued by the proletariat command center, led by Chairman Mao. It calls on the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad masses of revolutionary people to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly expose and overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and advance to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The two documents propose two opposing directions of struggle. The "Report Outline" adheres to the bourgeois worldview, directing the spearhead of struggle against the revolutionary leftists and revolutionary masses, attempting to strike and disintegrate the leftist revolutionary forces, protect the bourgeois representatives within the party, revisionist elements, and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," and is full of hatred for the proletarian revolutionaries and love for the bourgeois rightists. The "Summary of the Conference" adheres to the proletarian worldview, firmly believes in the masses, relies on the masses, and enthusiastically supports and praises the revolutionary actions of the masses, directing the spearhead of struggle angrily at the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat and crushing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie.

The emergence of the two documents is not accidental. They are the inevitable products of class struggle, the products of the struggle between the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie agents within the party is the concentrated expression of the contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the concentrated expression of the contradiction between socialism and capitalism. This is the principal contradiction throughout the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, an antagonistic contradiction. The "Summary of the Conference" and the "Report Outline" are the products of this antagonistic contradiction reaching a crucial juncture.

In September and October 1965, Chairman Mao proposed to criticize the anti-party and anti-socialist Wu Han. However, the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party refused to carry out this directive and resisted in every way. The proletarian revolutionaries in Shanghai resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's instructions. Under the direct guidance of Comrade Jiang Qing, Comrade Yao Wenyuan wrote "On the New Historical Drama 'Hairui Dismissed from Office.'" The publication of this article initiated the ideological preparation stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

The Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, with the indulgence and protection of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, used their authority to prevent Beijing newspapers from reprinting Comrade Yao Wenyuan's article and suppressed the critical articles of the proletarian revolutionary leftists. They spread fallacies such as "Wu Han's problem should be discussed as an academic issue" and "before truth, all are equal," attempting to cover up the serious political nature of this struggle. They tried to strangle the revolutionary criticism that had just begun.

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out on December 21, 1965: "The key issue in 'Hairui Dismissed from Office' is 'dismissal.' The Jiajing Emperor dismissed Hairui from office, and in 1959, we dismissed Peng Dehuai from office. Peng Dehuai is also a 'Hairui.'" This pointed out that "Hairui Dismissed from Office" is a plot by the bourgeois reactionary academics to use the story of the feudal official Hairui to attack the Communist Party and socialism, to rehabilitate right-opportunists like Peng Dehuai, and indicated the political nature of the criticism, which is to struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party.

However, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique strictly blocked Chairman Mao's instructions on the key issue of "Hairui Dismissed from Office." They openly resisted this instruction, declaring in various occasions that the criticism of Wu Han should not discuss the key issue, should not touch upon the issue of dismissing right-opportunists at the 1959 Lushan Conference, and should not discuss the anti-party and anti-socialist issues of Wu Han and others. They suppressed the leftists and protected the rightists, attempting to drag the revolutionary criticism to the right and into the bourgeois so-called "pure academic" discussion track. With the support of the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique issued the so-called "Report Outline" in the name of the Party Central Committee. At this time, they were overjoyed and crazy to the extreme.

At this moment, Comrade Lin Biao instructed Comrade Jiang Qing to convene the conference on army literary and art work in Shanghai. Under the personal care and guidance of Chairman Mao, the important historical document "Summary of the Conference" was drafted and issued. This historical document gave the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique a heavy blow and further armed the proletarian revolutionaries with Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao attached great importance to the document "Summary of the Conference." In a letter to the Standing Committee of the Central Military Commission on March 22, 1966, Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "This is a very good document. It uses Mao Zedong Thought to answer many major questions about the cultural revolution in the socialist period. It has not only great contemporary significance but also profound historical significance."

Comrade Lin Biao also emphasized in the letter: "For the past sixteen years, there has been a sharp class struggle on the literary and art front. The question of who will be victorious has not been resolved. If the proletariat does not occupy this front, the bourgeoisie will necessarily occupy it. The struggle is inevitable. This is an extremely broad and profound socialist revolution in the ideological realm. If we do not handle it well, revisionism will emerge. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely carry out this revolution to the end." This is Comrade Lin Biao's scientific conclusion, using Mao Zedong Thought, on the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in the ideological realm since the founding of the nation. The "Summary of the Conference" is also guided by this red line.

The "Summary of the Conference" pointed out sharply: In the socialist period, there is a struggle between two classes and two lines on the cultural front, that is, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for leadership on the cultural front. After the founding of the nation, the literary and art circle "has been usurped by a black line that is opposed to Chairman Mao's thoughts and is anti-party and anti-socialist." "If we do not seize it, many fronts will have to be left to the black line to occupy. This is a serious lesson." We must "resolutely carry out a socialist cultural revolution on the cultural front and thoroughly eliminate this black line."

This means that throughout the historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is a struggle between the restoration of capitalism by the bourgeoisie and the counter-restoration by the proletariat. It is either the proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie or the bourgeoisie seizing power from the proletariat. We must absolutely not tolerate the situation where some places and departments have been usurped by the anti-party and anti-socialist black line. Therefore, we must carry out the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thoroughly overthrow the handful of big and small capitalist-roaders in power within the party and the handful of big and small counter-revolutionary revisionists within the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The "Summary of the Conference" pointed out: To carry out the socialist cultural revolution to the end, we still need to make long-term and arduous efforts. "After eliminating this black line, there will still be future black lines, and we will have to struggle again. Therefore, this is a long-term, arduous, and complex struggle that will take decades or even hundreds of years. This is a major issue related to the future of our revolution and also a major issue related to the future of the world revolution."

This is thorough materialism, thorough dialectics, and thorough Marxist class struggle theory. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to prevent the restoration of capitalism, we must carry out many Great Proletarian Cultural Revolutions. As long as there are classes and class contradictions, there will inevitably be class struggle and struggle for power. The victory or defeat of the revolution will be resolved over a very long historical period. Therefore, we must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, be prepared for long-term and arduous struggles, be prepared to fight for decades, a hundred years, or even hundreds of years, until we carry out the socialist revolution to the end and transition from the socialist society to the communist society. If we do not recognize the problem in this way, thinking that after one or several cultural revolutions, the world will be peaceful and we can relax our vigilance, we may repeat the mistake of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. On this issue, we must not be complacent.

The emergence and struggle of the "Summary of the Conference" and the "Report Outline" are a heart-pounding struggle between the Marxist-Leninist line represented by Chairman Mao and the revisionist line represented by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party during the ideological preparation stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. This struggle foreshadowed the imminent stormy arrival of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the bankruptcy of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party.

In May 1966, under the personal direction of our great leader Chairman Mao, the great Marxist-Leninist document "Notification of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, May 16, 1966" was formulated. This document deeply exposed and criticized the "Report Outline," smashed the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique's attempt to strangle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieve the restoration of capitalism, and disrupted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line led by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party. This document proposed the theory, line, policy, and direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sounding the charge for the advance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This document pushed the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat to a new stage.

On June 1, 1966, Chairman Mao personally approved the nationwide broadcast of the first big-character poster of Marxism-Leninism at Peking University, issuing the order for a comprehensive attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party. Since then, the mass movement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been vigorously carried out nationwide.

In one year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved great victories. Our country has undergone earth-shaking changes. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party have been one by one exposed and overthrown by the masses. The "Report Outline," along with its author, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and their backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, have completely bankrupted and failed. The power over party, government, finance, and culture usurped by the capitalist-roaders in power within the party is being gradually seized back by the proletariat. Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletarian revolutionaries have grown and become a mighty army of proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat has been verified and developed in the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This marks a new stage in the development of Marxism. This is Chairman Mao's invaluable contribution to the Chinese people and to the international proletariat.

The "Summary of the Conference" is now being published. Let us, with the current revolutionary struggle tasks, study the great historical document "Notification" together with Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and other documents and instructions of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seriously study the "Summary of the Conference," hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the party, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    两个根本对立的文件
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第九期社论
    一九六六年二月，是一个不平常的二月，是我国无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级激烈斗争的二月。这时，在我们党内出现了两个根本对立的文件。一个是彭真的《汇报提纲》，一个是《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》。
    《汇报提纲》，是彭真反革命修正主义集团，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，从二月三日到七日，在北京精心炮制出来的。这个提纲，是反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的反革命纲领，是反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的纲领，是彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领。
    《座谈会纪要》，是林彪同志委托江青同志，从二月二日到二十日，在上海主持召开部队文艺工作座谈会，经过参加座谈会的同志反复研究，又经过毛主席三次审阅修改而写成的。这个纪要，是同《汇报提纲》针锋相对的，是巩固无产阶级专政、粉碎资本主义复辟的重要文件，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的马克思列宁主义的文件。
    两个文件，是代表两个阶级的两面旗帜。《汇报提纲》，是资产阶级向无产阶级进行猖狂进攻的一面黑旗。《座谈会纪要》，则是无产阶级向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动大反击的一面红旗。
    两个文件，是从两个代表不同阶级的司令部里发出来的两种号令。《汇报提纲》，是以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级司令部发出来的反革命号令，它号召党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，保护他们窃取的政治、思想、文化的领导权和阵地，为颠覆无产阶级专政而拚死斗争。《座谈会纪要》，则是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部发出来的革命号令，它号召无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，开展无产阶级文化大革命，彻底揭露和打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，为巩固无产阶级专政而冲锋前进。
    两个文件，提出两种相反的斗争方向。《汇报提纲》，坚持资产阶级世界观，把斗争的矛头指向革命左派和革命群众，妄图打击左派，瓦解左派革命队伍，保护党内的资产阶级代表人物、修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”，对无产阶级革命派充满了恨，对资产阶级右派充满了爱。《座谈会纪要》，则坚持无产阶级的世界观，坚决相信群众，依靠群众，热情地支持和歌颂群众的革命行动，把斗争矛头愤怒地指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和反革命修正主义路线，大长无产阶级的志气，大灭资产阶级的威风。
    两个文件的产生，绝不是偶然的。它们是阶级斗争的必然产物，是无产阶级革命派同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的产物。在无产阶级专政条件下，无产阶级同党内资产阶级代理人的矛盾，是无产阶级同资产阶级两个阶级矛盾的集中表现，是社会主义同资本主义两条道路矛盾的集中表现。这是无产阶级专政整个时期的主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。《座谈会纪要》同《汇报提纲》，就是这个对抗性的矛盾发展到重要关头的产物。
    一九六五年九、十月间，毛主席提出要对反党反社会主义的吴晗进行批判。但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派拒绝执行，并千方百计地进行对抗。上海的无产阶级革命派，坚决执行毛主席的指示。在江青同志的直接指导下，姚文元同志写了《评新编历史剧〈海瑞罢官〉》。这篇文章的发表，在意识形态领域内开展了对吴晗及其他反党反社会主义的资产阶级代表人物的批判。我国无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的舆论准备阶段，从此开始了。
    彭真反革命修正主义集团，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的纵容和包庇下，利用职权，不准北京报纸转载姚文元同志的文章，扣压无产阶级革命左派的批判文章，他们大肆散布“吴晗的问题要作为学术问题讨论”、“在真理面前人人平等”之类的谬论，极力掩盖这场斗争的严重政治性质。他们妄图扼杀刚刚兴起的这场革命的批判。
    毛主席在一九六五年十二月二十一日又明确指出：《海瑞罢官》的“要害问题是‘罢官’。嘉靖皇帝罢了海瑞的官，一九五九年我们罢了彭德怀的官。彭德怀也是‘海瑞’。”这就指明了《海瑞罢官》是资产阶级反动学阀利用封建官吏海瑞的故事，来影射攻击共产党和社会主义，为彭德怀等右倾机会主义分子翻案，同时指明了批判的政治性质，就是同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争。
    但是，彭真反革命修正主义集团，严密封锁毛主席关于《海瑞罢官》的要害问题的指示。他们公然对抗这个指示，在各种场合宣称，对吴晗的批判，不准谈要害问题，不准涉及一九五九年庐山会议对右倾机会主义分子的罢官问题，不准谈吴晗等反党反社会主义的问题。他们打击左派，包庇右派，妄图把这场革命的批判拉向右转，纳入资产阶级的所谓“纯学术”讨论的轨道。彭真反革命修正主义集团，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，盗用党中央的名义向全党发出了所谓《汇报提纲》。这时，他们得意忘形，疯狂到了极点。
    就在这个时候，林彪同志委托江青同志在上海主持召开了部队文艺工作座谈会。在毛主席亲自关怀和指导下，起草和批发了《座谈会纪要》这个重要的历史文献。这个历史文献，给了彭真反革命修正主义集团当头一棒，并且用毛泽东思想把无产阶级革命派进一步武装起来。
    林彪同志非常重视《座谈会纪要》这个文件。在一九六六年三月二十二日，林彪同志给中央军委常委的一封信中指出：这“是一个很好的文件，用毛泽东思想回答了社会主义时期文化革命的许多重大问题，不仅有极大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义。”
    林彪同志在这封信中还强调指出：“十六年来，文艺战线上存在着尖锐的阶级斗争，谁战胜谁的问题还没有解决。文艺这个阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领，斗争是不可避免的。这是在意识形态领域里极为广泛、深刻的社会主义革命，搞不好就会出修正主义。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地把这一场革命进行到底。”这是林彪同志运用毛泽东思想，对建国以来意识形态领域内两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线的斗争，所作的科学结论。《座谈会纪要》贯串的也正是这样一条红线。
    《座谈会纪要》，一针见血地指出：在社会主义阶段，文化战线上存在着“两个阶级、两条路线的斗争，即无产阶级和资产阶级在文化战线上争夺领导权的斗争”。文艺界在建国以后，“被一条与毛主席思想相对立的反党反社会主义的黑线专了我们的政”。“只要我们不抓，很多阵地就只好听任黑线去占领，这是一条严重的教训。”我们必须“坚决进行一场文化战线上的社会主义大革命，彻底搞掉这条黑线”。
    这就是说，在无产阶级专政的整个历史阶段中，存在着资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争。不是无产阶级专资产阶级的政，就是资产阶级专无产阶级的政。对于某些地方、某些部门被反党反社会主义黑线专了我们的政的状况，我们绝对不能容忍。因此，必须开展无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动，把钻进党内和无产阶级专政机构内的一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派，一小撮大大小小的反革命修正主义分子彻底打倒。
    《座谈会纪要》指出：要把社会主义文化革命进行到底，还需要我们作长期的、艰苦的努力。“搞掉这条黑线之后，还会有将来的黑线，还得再斗争。所以，这是一场艰巨、复杂、长期的斗争，要经过几十年甚至几百年的努力。这是关系到我国革命前途的大事，也是关系到世界革命前途的大事。”
    这是彻底的唯物论，彻底的辩证法，彻底的马克思主义的阶级斗争学说。在无产阶级专政条件下，要防止资本主义复辟，必须进行许多次无产阶级文化大革命。只要存在着阶级和阶级矛盾，就必然有阶级斗争，必然有争夺政权的斗争。革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。因此，我们必须发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，必须准备作长期的、艰苦的斗争，准备斗它几十年，斗它一百年，斗它几百年，直到把社会主义革命进行到底，直到由社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会。如果不是这样来认识问题，以为经过这一次或几次文化大革命，天下从此就太平无事了，因而松懈斗志，丧失警惕，那就有可能重蹈苏联资本主义复辟的覆辙。在这个问题上，我们千万不要麻痹大意。
    《座谈会纪要》和《汇报提纲》的产生与斗争，是在我国无产阶级文化大革命的舆论准备阶段中，以毛主席为代表的马克思列宁主义路线，同以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的修正主义路线的一场惊心动魄的斗争。这场斗争，预示了无产阶级文化大革命急风暴雨的来临，预示了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的破产。
    一九六六年五月，在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲自主持下，制定了伟大的马克思列宁主义的文件——中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》。这个文件，深刻地揭露和批判了《汇报提纲》，粉碎了彭真反革命修正主义集团妄图扼杀无产阶级文化大革命，实现资本主义复辟的阴谋，打乱了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为首的反革命修正主义阵线。这个文件，提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，吹响了无产阶级文化大革命进军的号角。这个文件，把无产阶级专政的学说推进到了一个崭新的阶段。
    一九六六年六月一日，毛主席亲自批示在全国广播北京大学第一张马克思列宁主义的大字报，发出了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派全面进攻的号令。从此，无产阶级文化大革命群众运动在全国范围内轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。
    一年来，无产阶级文化大革命取得了伟大的胜利。在我们国家里，发生了天翻地覆的变化。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，一个一个地被揭露出来，被群众斗臭斗倒。《汇报提纲》，连同它的作者彭真反革命修正主义集团及其后台中国的赫鲁晓夫，完全地破产了，完全地失败了。党内走资本主义道路当权派篡夺的一些党、政、财、文大权，正在重新掌握在无产阶级手里。在毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，无产阶级革命派成长壮大起来，结成千军万马的无产阶级革命大军。毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的光辉理论，在无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中得到证实和发展。这标志着马克思主义发展的新阶段。这是毛主席对于中国人民，对于国际无产阶级的不可估量的贡献。
    《座谈会纪要》，现在公开发表了。让我们带着当前的革命斗争任务，结合学习伟大的历史文件《通知》，学习毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，以及无产阶级文化大革命的其他文件和指示，认真地学习《座谈会纪要》，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底地批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
