The large-scale song and dance drama "Thunder in the Southwest," which reflects the glorious victory of the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, recently premiered in Guiyang. This drama, with its rich and varied artistic forms, showcases the brilliant and heroic journey of the Cultural Revolution in Guizhou Province. It passionately praises the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, deeply exposes and lashes out at the heinous crimes of the capitalist roaders in power within the party, and closely aligns with the current struggle. It greatly inspires and educates the broad audience.

"Thunder in the Southwest" was born under the radiant guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. Its premiere is a new victory for Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line. On April 1, Comrade Chen Boda's important article "Patriotism or Treason?" was published, sounding the charge for a general offensive against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Revolutionary literary and artistic workers in Guizhou Province and Guiyang City, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "literature and art should become an integral part of the revolutionary machine, serving as a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy," decided to swiftly take up this sharp weapon of literature and art at this crucial moment of the great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads. They immediately formed the "Thunder in the Southwest" performance team, consisting of 14 units including provincial and municipal literary and artistic troupes, schools, military units, and Red Guard organizations, with over 200 professional and amateur artists. After days and nights of intensive creation and rehearsal, "Thunder in the Southwest" began its performances in the mountain city of Guiyang on April 28.

The drama is divided into five parts: "The Great Victory of Mao Zedong's Revolutionary Line (Prologue)," "Severe Test," "Storm in the Mountain City," "Thunder in the Southwest," and "New Guizhou on the March." In the prologue, through a review of the struggles at Jinggangshan, the Zunyi Conference, the Long March, and the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, it vividly depicts how, at every critical turning point in China's revolution, it is our most beloved great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Mao Zedong who firmly steers the course, guiding the Chinese revolution to sail through stormy seas and treacherous rapids, achieving one glorious victory after another. The following two acts, set against the backdrop of the early Cultural Revolution, depict the heroic Red Guards and the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians defending Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line and engaging in unyielding and courageous struggles against the bourgeois reactionary line. The fourth and fifth parts of the drama focus on the struggle for power by the proletarian revolutionaries in Guizhou against the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, passionately reflecting the joy of the revolutionary masses in seizing power, and praising the proletarian revolutionaries who, after seizing power, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward on the sunny path.

In recent days, many proletarian revolutionary fighters who have watched this drama have expressed that "Thunder in the Southwest" is a highly political and combative drama, a living textbook of the struggle between the two lines. Watching such a drama makes us love the boundless Mao Zedong Thought even more, and we clearly see the ugly face of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, arousing our strong hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line!

Most of the creators and performers of "Thunder in the Southwest" are proletarian revolutionary fighters who stand at the forefront of the struggle.

    《西南的春雷》大型歌舞剧在贵阳公演
    许多无产阶级革命派战士说：看了这样的戏，我们更加热爱光焰无际的毛泽东思想，我们更加仇恨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    据新华社贵阳十一日电　以反映贵州省无产阶级文化大革命在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下取得光辉胜利为主题的大型歌舞剧《西南的春雷》，最近在贵阳正式公演。这出歌舞剧，以丰富多采的艺术形式，展现了贵州省无产阶级文化大革命的光辉战斗历程，满腔热情地歌颂了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，深刻地揭露和鞭挞了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行，密切地配合了当前的实际斗争，使广大观众受到很大的鼓舞和教育。
    《西南的春雷》是在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下诞生的。它的公演，是毛主席的文艺路线的新胜利。四月一日，戚本禹同志的重要文章《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》的发表，吹响了向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派总攻击的号角。贵州省、贵阳市的革命文艺工作者根据毛主席的“要使文艺很好地成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”的伟大教导，决心在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，迅速拿起文艺这个锐利的武器，挺身而出，投入战斗。他们马上组成了《西南的春雷》演出团，参加的有省、市文艺团体、学校、部队、红卫兵组织等十四个单位的专业和业余文艺工作者，共两百多人。经过夜以继日地突击创作和排练，《西南的春雷》在四月二十八日开始和山城贵阳的观众见面。
    这出歌舞剧分为：“毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利（即序幕）”、“严峻的考验”、“山城风暴”、“西南的春雷”、“新贵州在前进”五个部分。在序幕里，通过对井冈山的斗争、遵义会议、长征途中、革命圣地延安等一系列光辉历程的回顾，生动地表现出每当我国革命处于历史转折的关键时刻，都是我们最最敬爱的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席紧紧掌握着航向，使中国革命顺利地渡过惊涛骇浪和急流险滩，取得一个又一个辉煌的胜利。序幕以后的两场，以无产阶级文化大革命初期，原贵州省委、贵阳市委内一小撮修正主义分子一手制造的“六·六”、“八·三一”、“九·五”等镇压革命群众运动的事件为背景，在舞台上再现了英雄的红卫兵小将和广大无产阶级革命派战士誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同资产阶级反动路线展开不屈不挠的英勇搏斗的战斗历程。歌舞剧的第四、第五部分，集中地表现了贵州无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，热情洋溢地反映了取得夺权胜利的革命群众的喜悦，歌颂了无产阶级革命派掌权后高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阳光灿烂的大道上高歌猛进。
    连日来，许多无产阶级革命派战士看了这个戏后表示：《西南的春雷》是一出具有极其强烈的政治性、战斗性的戏，是一部两条路线斗争的活教材。看了这样的戏，我们更加热爱光焰无际的毛泽东思想，更加认清了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的狰狞面目，激起我们对资产阶级反动路线的强烈仇恨！
    参加《西南的春雷》创作和演出的人员，大多数是挺身站在斗争的最前列的无产阶级革命派战士。
