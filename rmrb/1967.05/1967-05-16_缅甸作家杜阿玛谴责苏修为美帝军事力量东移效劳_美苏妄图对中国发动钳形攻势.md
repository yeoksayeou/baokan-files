Burmese writer Du A Ma denounces Soviet revisionist leaders for actively aiding U.S. imperialism in shifting military forces eastward and expanding the aggression in Vietnam. The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership is exposed.

Du A Ma said, after the meeting in Karlovy Vary between Soviet leaders and European "Communist" parties, the Johnson administration quickly announced the withdrawal of 35,000 U.S. troops from West Germany. Johnson took this action with the assurance of the Karlovy Vary meeting's statement on "seeking peace and security in Europe." She said such a withdrawal could only be made after reaching an understanding with the other side.

She said that after reaching an understanding with the Soviet revisionists, the Johnson administration began withdrawing U.S. troops from West Germany starting in 1965. These troops later reappeared in Vietnam.

Du A Ma recalled that during the U.S. aggression against Korea, the explosive situation in Berlin made it impossible to withdraw U.S. troops from Europe. Now, due to an understanding reached with the Soviet side, U.S. troops have been withdrawn from West Germany. The Soviet Union has shelved the German peace treaty and seeks to establish a so-called "European collective security system." All this is a great encouragement to the West German militarists and revanchists who are waiting for an opportunity.

Du A Ma continued, according to reports, Soviet troops withdrawn from Europe have been transferred to the Sino-Soviet border. She said, U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are attempting to launch a pincer attack on China and the peoples of Asia.

She said, however, the U.S. aggressors and the Soviet revisionist leadership are doomed to failure. Now, people's liberation struggles are sweeping across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Imperialism and capitalism are destined to perish.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, May 13: Burmese writer Du A Ma denounces the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership to play with the so-called "prevention of nuclear proliferation." The article says that those who are armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons, in the absence of a comprehensive ban and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, plot to ban nuclear tests and prevent nuclear proliferation. This is merely an attempt to monopolize nuclear weapons.

The article denounces the Soviet revisionist leadership's representative at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, who said that the increase in the number of nuclear states would increase the danger of nuclear war. This is merely laughable nonsense. The article points out that the danger of nuclear war does not come from so-called nuclear proliferation, but from the U.S. imperialists who brandish nuclear weapons and bully everywhere. The Soviet revisionists try to cover up the truth of U.S. imperialism spreading nuclear weapons with the tactic of "preventing nuclear proliferation."

The article says that China's production of nuclear weapons is to counter the nuclear blackmail of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists. Nuclear weapons in the hands of the Chinese people are a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and a great encouragement to the revolutionary struggles of other countries. At the same time, it is a great contribution to the defense of world peace.

    缅甸作家杜阿玛谴责苏修为美帝军事力量东移效劳
    美苏妄图对中国发动钳形攻势
    新华社仰光电　缅甸著名作家杜阿玛十二日在《人民报》上发表文章，揭露苏联修正主义领导集团积极为美帝国主义推行军事力量东移、扩大侵略越南战争的阴谋效劳的叛徒嘴脸。
    杜阿玛说，在苏修领导人和欧洲的“共产党”举行的卡罗维发利会议之后，约翰逊政府很快就宣布从西德撤出三万五千名美军。约翰逊采取这一行动，是得到卡罗维发利会议关于“争取欧洲和平与安全”的声明的保证的。她说，这种撤军只能在同另一方取得谅解之后才能作出。
    她说，约翰逊政府在同苏修取得谅解之后，从一九六五年开始从西德撤出美军。这些军队以后又在越南出现了。
    杜阿玛追述说，美国对朝鲜进行侵略战争期间，由于柏林的爆炸性的局势，不可能从欧洲撤出美国军队。现在，由于同苏联方面达成了谅解，美国军队从西德撤出来了。苏联把对德和约搁置起来，力求建立所谓“欧洲集体安全体系”，这一切都是对现在正在等待时机的西德军国主义复仇主义者莫大的鼓舞。
    杜阿玛接着说，据报道，从欧洲撤出的苏联军队已转移到中苏边境地区。她说，美帝国主义者和苏联修正主义者企图对中国和亚洲人民发动钳形攻势。
    她说，但是，美国侵略者和苏联修正主义领导集团必然失败。现在人民解放斗争席卷了亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲。帝国主义和资本主义注定要灭亡。
    新华社仰光十三日电　缅甸著名作家杜阿玛十三日在《人民报》发表文章谴责美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团玩弄的所谓“防止核扩散”阴谋。文章说，那些自己用核武器武装到牙齿的人，在不全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器的情况下，策划禁止核试验和防止核扩散的阴谋，只不过是企图由他们来垄断核武器而已。
    文章谴责苏联修正主义领导集团出席日内瓦裁军会议的代表所谓核国家的数量增加，将增加核战争的危险的说法，只不过是可笑无稽之谈。文章指出，核战争的危险不是来自所谓核扩散，而是来自挥舞核武器、到处横行霸道的美帝国主义。苏修试图用“防止核扩散”的手法来掩盖美帝国主义扩散核武器的真相。
    文章说，中国制造核武器是为了反对美帝和苏修的核讹诈。核武器掌握在中国人民手中是对越南人民抗美救国斗争的巨大鼓舞，也是对其他国家的革命斗争的巨大鼓舞，同时也是对保卫世界和平的巨大贡献。
