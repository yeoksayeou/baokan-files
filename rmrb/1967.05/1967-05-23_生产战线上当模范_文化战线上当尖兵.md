Our great leader Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism literary theory and the compass for the proletarian revolutionary literary cause. This epoch-making important document radiates boundless brilliance, illuminating the path forward for revolutionary literary workers.

We, a few workers fighting on the production frontline, have taken up literary weapons and joined the battle under the radiant guidance of Chairman Mao's great work. We have also grown under the nurturing of the "Talks."

The brilliance of the "Talks" has enlightened us, making us realize that steel is what we forge, cloth is what we weave, grain is what we grow, houses are what we build, and the world is what we create. We have created the material world and, at the same time, the spiritual world. We are not only the masters of production but also the masters of culture! With this courage and confidence, we have taken up our pens, written, sung, and performed, and stepped onto the literary stage.

The brilliance of the "Talks" has enlightened us, making us realize the importance of literature and art. They are our proletarian "weapons to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy"! We, the working class, must firmly grasp this weapon, use this weapon, and with the revolutionary gun and pen, defend our people's mountains and rivers and consolidate our proletarian dictatorship!

The brilliance of the "Talks" has enlightened us, making us realize that literature and art must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and must serve the socialist economic base. We must write about the heroic figures of the working class and sing praises for the heroic deeds of the working class!

The brilliance of the "Talks" has enlightened us, making us realize that there are sharp and complex class struggles in the literary field. The proletariat must resolutely counter all challenges from the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, using proletarian new thoughts, new culture, new customs, and new habits to change people's spiritual outlook, and seize back the leadership of the literary world that has been usurped by a handful of revisionists!

The literary world is by no means calm. Over the past seventeen years, under the support and direction of the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists have stubbornly implemented the revisionist literary line, using it to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but they say that literature and art should serve the "whole people";

Chairman Mao teaches us that literary workers must first undergo a transformation in their worldview, but they insidiously say: "Your key is in artistic technique";

Chairman Mao teaches us that a revolutionary literary worker must study Marxism-Leninism and society, but they advocate: "As long as you are familiar with famous works from ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign";

Chairman Mao teaches us to use the past for the present and use foreign things for Chinese purposes, but they promote reverence for the past and contempt for the present, worship of foreign things and rejection of Chinese things, reverence for the dead and contempt for the living;

Chairman Mao teaches us to vigorously sing the praises of new heroes, but they put forward the "realism" theory, the "deepening of realism" theory, the "convergence of the spirit of the times" theory, the "intermediate character" theory, and so on.

The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, on the one hand, vigorously support a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary "authorities" in the literary world, placing them in important positions, spreading all kinds of fallacies, and creating poisonous weeds to prepare public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. On the other hand, they use every means to suppress and attack us, the workers, peasants, and soldiers literary warriors, and exhaust all means to slander our literary creations. They say that the works written by workers are "full of machine noises" and "not as good as the chirping of cicadas." Even more vicious is that they use the "three names" and "three highs" policies to corrupt us, the workers, peasants, and soldiers amateur authors, attempting to turn some of us into people who wear work clothes but have small-bourgeois and bourgeois independent kingdoms in their minds; attempting to turn some of us into decorations in front of their big black shop, becoming tools for their capitalist restoration. What is particularly infuriating is that the backstage boss of this revisionist literary black line, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, used the vicious method of "striking a large number and protecting a few" to direct the associations, newspapers, and work teams under his black hand control that implement his bourgeois reactionary line, to distort right and wrong, confuse right and wrong, and on the amateur literary front, strike a large number of workers, peasants, and soldiers literary warriors to protect a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary "authorities." They thought that in this way, the vast number of workers, peasants, and soldiers amateur literary creators would no longer be able to take up the pen to create literature and art, and would no longer be able to vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought. How poisonous their intentions are!

We, the working class, are tough bones and are not afraid of attacks or suppression. We must take up the pen and resolutely defend Chairman Mao's brilliant "Talks" and the proletarian literary line. We must firmly hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash this counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line! Directly strike at the backstage boss of this black line! Seize the leadership of the literary front and firmly grasp it in the hands of the proletariat! Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is our magic weapon to seize power from the revisionists in the literary world and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the revisionist literary black line.

We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, become models of seizing revolution and promoting production; we must also firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, strive to create revolutionary, combative literary and artistic works that are popular among the workers, peasants, and soldiers, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and be vanguards on the cultural front.

    生产战线上当模范　文化战线上当尖兵
    上海工人业余作者  陈继光　刘广义　居有松  金六宝　徐林　徐怀金
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是当代马克思列宁主义文艺理论的最高峰，是无产阶级革命文艺事业的指南针。这部划时代的重要文献，焕发着无比的光辉，照亮了革命文艺工作者前进的道路。
    我们这几个战斗在生产第一线的工人，就是在毛主席的这部伟大著作的光辉照耀下，拿起文艺武器投入战斗的，也是在《讲话》的哺育下成长起来的。
    《讲话》的光辉照耀着我们，使我们认识到钢铁是我们炼的，棉布是我们织的，粮食是我们种的，房子是我们盖的，世界是我们创造的。我们创造了物质世界，同时也创造了精神世界。我们不仅是生产的主人，也是文化的主人！于是我们勇气十足、信心百倍地拿起笔杆子，大写大唱大演，登上了文艺舞台。
    《讲话》的光辉照耀着我们，使我们认识到文艺的重要性，它是我们无产阶级“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”！我们工人阶级一定要牢牢地掌握这个武器，运用这个武器，用革命的枪杆子和革命的笔杆子，保卫我们人民的江山，巩固我们无产阶级专政！
    《讲话》的光辉照耀着我们，使我们认识到文艺必须为工农兵服务，必须为社会主义经济基础服务。我们必须大写工人阶级的英雄人物，为我们工人阶级的英雄业绩大唱赞歌！
    《讲话》的光辉照耀着我们，使我们认识到文艺领域里存在着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，无产阶级必须迎头痛击资产阶级在意识形态领域里的一切挑战，用无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯来改变人的精神面貌，把被一小撮修正主义分子所窃取的文艺界的领导权夺回来！
    文艺界绝不是风平浪静的。十七年来，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的支持和指使下，一小撮反革命修正主义分子顽固地执行修正主义文艺路线，以此来对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线。
    毛主席教导我们，文艺要为工农兵服务，他们却胡说什么文艺要为“全民”服务；
    毛主席教导我们，文艺工作者首先要在世界观这个根本问题上来一番改造，他们却别有用心地说：“你们的关键在于艺术技巧”；
    毛主席教导我们，一个革命的文艺工作者一定要学习马克思列宁主义和学习社会，他们却提倡什么“只要通晓古今中外名著”；
    毛主席教导我们，要古为今用，洋为中用，他们却大搞厚古薄今，崇洋非中，厚死薄生；
    毛主席教导我们，要大力歌颂新英雄人物，而他们却抛出什么“写真实”论，“现实主义深化”论，“时代精神汇合”论，“中间人物”论，等等。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一方面在文艺界大力扶植一小撮反革命修正主义分子和反动“权威”，把他们安插在重要职位上，放出种种谬论，制造丛丛毒草，为他们复辟资本主义作舆论准备；一方面又对我们工农兵文艺战士，千方百计进行打击、压制，对我们工农兵的文艺创作竭尽攻击污蔑之能事。他们胡说什么工人写的作品是“一片机器声”，“不如知了叫”。更毒辣的是，他们还用什么“三名”主义、“三高”政策来腐蚀我们工农兵业余作者，妄图使我们当中的一部分人，变成身上穿着工作服，头脑里却埋藏着小资产阶级、资产阶级独立王国的人；妄图使我们当中的一部分人，变成他们这家大黑店门前的装饰品，成为他们搞资本主义复辟的工具。特别令人愤慨的是，这个修正主义文艺黑线的总后台，在无产阶级文化大革命中，又使用“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的恶毒手法，指使在他黑手控制下的协会、报刊，以及执行他的资产阶级反动路线的工作组，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，在业余文艺战线上，打击一大片工农兵文艺战士，来保护文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动“权威”。他们以为这样一来，广大的工农兵业余文艺创作者，从此就不能拿起笔杆进行文艺创作，就不能大力宣传毛泽东思想了。用心何其毒也！
    我们工人阶级是硬骨头，绝不怕围攻，绝不怕打击。我们就是要拿起笔杆子，誓死捍卫毛主席的光辉的《讲话》，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线。我们一定要高举革命的批判旗帜，彻底砸烂这条反革命修正主义的文艺黑线！直捣这条黑线的总后台！把文艺战线上的领导权夺过来，牢牢地掌握在我们无产阶级手里！毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这篇光辉著作，就是我们从文艺界修正主义分子手中夺权的法宝，就是我们彻底肃清修正主义文艺黑线流毒的法宝。
    我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，成为抓革命、促生产的模范；我们也一定要牢记毛主席的教导，努力创作革命化、战斗化的为工农兵所喜闻乐见的文艺作品，大力宣传毛泽东思想，在文化战线上当尖兵。
