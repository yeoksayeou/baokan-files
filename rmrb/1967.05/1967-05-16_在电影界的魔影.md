The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the trumpet blower for imperialist, feudalist, and capitalist art. From the treasonous film *The Last Emperor* to various feudal dregs and bourgeois trash, he treasures them all.

In 1949, shortly after the nation's liberation, some reactionary American films and semi-feudal, semi-colonial Chinese reactionary films continued to poison the Chinese people. Chairman Mao taught us, "Imperialist culture and semi-feudal culture are very close brothers. They form a reactionary alliance in the cultural realm to oppose China's new culture. This reactionary culture serves imperialism and the feudal class and is something that must be overthrown." At that time, the serious task facing revolutionary film workers was to thoroughly clean out these reactionary films. However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party actually said, "Regarding the problems in the literary and artistic circles, there is no need to take them too seriously. The Chinese people have been watching American films for decades, and yet the Chinese revolution still succeeded." He completely absolved American films of the crime of poisoning the Chinese people and openly protected reactionary American films. Later, during the three years of difficulty, he again praised American films, saying, "Films like *Out of the Water Lily* are quite good. They can be shown to cadres. They are entertainment films, and everyone can watch them." *Out of the Water Lily* is an American film that showcases legs and promotes decadent and corrupt bourgeois ideology. The top capitalist-roader within the Party actually held it up as a model for "mass art" and "entertainment films." From this, one can see what kind of stuff is called "mass art" and "entertainment films." At that time, a Frenchman made a documentary about American life called *An American Viewed by a Frenchman*. The film was full of eroticism, decadence, and hysteria. After watching it, the top capitalist-roader within the Party actually said, "This film is not bad!" From this, one can not only see how ugly the soul of the top capitalist-roader within the Party is, but also see how urgently he wanted to use these imperialist films to pave the way for the restoration of capitalism.

Chairman Mao taught us, "We must definitely shift our position. We must, in the process of deeply engaging with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and deeply participating in actual struggles, and in the process of learning Marxism and learning about society, gradually shift our position to the side of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have true art for workers, peasants, and soldiers, and true proletarian art." The top capitalist-roader within the Party dared to openly contradict Chairman Mao. He said, "A writer must know several foreign languages and be able to read the original works of Tolstoy, Balzac, Goethe, and Shakespeare to write world-renowned masterpieces." This means that we should not engage with workers, peasants, and soldiers, but should kneel before foreign bourgeois writers and follow in the footsteps of the bourgeoisie. He also said, "Do not demand too much of the lifestyle of artists. 'Artists' are those with eccentric temperaments. If they do not have eccentric temperaments, they are not artists." To legalize the bourgeois worldview and lifestyle of artists and resist ideological remolding, the top capitalist-roader within the Party actually used "eccentric temperaments" as a shield, which is extremely shameless!

In the autumn of 1962, he said, "Everything can be written, even about capitalists." This top capitalist-roader within the Party is so loyal to capitalists. He never forgets to promote bourgeois liberalization in the literary and artistic circles and never forgets to use art to sing the praises of and beautify capitalists, paving the way for the restoration of capitalism!

    在电影界的魔影
    中国影协革命造反委员会
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派是帝国主义、封建主义、资本主义文艺的吹鼓手，从卖国主义影片《清宫秘史》到各种封建糟粕、资产阶级臭货，他无不当作宝贝。
    一九四九年，全国刚解放，一些美国反动影片和半封建半殖民地的中国反动影片，继续在毒害着中国人民。毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义文化和半封建文化是非常亲热的两兄弟，它们结成文化上的反动同盟，反对中国的新文化。这类反动文化是替帝国主义和封建阶级服务的，是应该被打倒的东西。”当时革命的电影工作者面临的一个严重任务，就是对于这些反动影片，来一次彻底的大扫除。可是党内头号走资本主义道路当权派竟说：“对文艺界的问题，不必看得太严重，中国人看美国电影看了几十年，中国革命还不是胜利了。”把美帝影片毒害中国人民的罪责开脱得一干二净，公然保护美国反动影片。后来，在三年困难时期，他又曾再次吹捧美国影片，说什么“《出水芙蓉》这种片子，很好嘛，可以让干部看看。这是娱乐片，大家都可以看看嘛！”《出水芙蓉》是美国一部表演大腿宣扬糜烂腐朽的资产阶级思想的影片，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派居然拿来作为“全民文艺”和“娱乐片”的标兵。由此可见所谓“全民文艺”和“娱乐片”是什么货色了。当时，有个法国人拍了一部纪录美国生活方式的纪录片，叫做《一个法国人眼中的美国》，影片中充满了色情、颓废、歇斯底里的东西，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派看了以后，竟说：“这部片子不错！”从这里不但可以看出党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的灵魂多么丑恶，而且更可以看出他是多么急迫地要利用这些帝国主义影片来为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。
    毛主席教导我们，“一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派胆大包天，公开和毛主席唱反调。他说：“一个作家必须懂得几国外国文字，必须能直接阅读托尔斯泰、巴尔扎克、歌德和莎士比亚等人的经典著作的原文，才能写出世界驰名的杰作来。”这就是要我们的作家不要深入工农兵，而要拜倒在外国资产阶级作家脚下，跟着资产阶级的脚印去爬行。他又说：“对艺术家的生活方式不要要求太严，‘艺术家’就是有怪脾气的，要没有怪脾气就不成其为艺术家了。”为了使艺术家的资产阶级世界观和资产阶级生活方式合法化，抗拒思想改造，党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派竟抬出一个“怪脾气”作为挡箭牌，实在无耻之极！
    一九六二年秋，他又说：“什么都可以写，资本家也可以写。”这个党内头号走资本主义道路当权派对资本家何等忠心耿耿，他念念不忘在文艺界大搞资产阶级自由化，念念不忘利用文艺去歌颂和美化资本家，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道！
