Title: On the Problem of Researching "Dream of the Red Chamber"
Author: Mao Zedong
Date: 1967-05-27
Edition: 1

The two articles refuting Yu Pingbo are attached for your perusal. This marks the first serious challenge in over thirty years to the erroneous views of the so-called authority on "Dream of the Red Chamber" research. The authors are two members of the Communist Youth League. Initially, they wrote to the *Literary Gazette* inquiring if they could critique Yu Pingbo, but their request was ignored. Unable to proceed, they wrote to their alma mater, Shandong University, seeking support from their teachers, and their articles refuting *A Brief Discussion on "Dream of the Red Chamber"* were published in the university's journal *Literature, History, and Philosophy*. The issue then returned to Beijing, where some individuals, citing various reasons (primarily that the articles were written by "insignificant individuals" and that the party newspaper was not a forum for free debate), opposed publishing the articles in the *People's Daily* to stimulate discussion and criticism. Eventually, a compromise was reached, allowing the articles to be published in the *Literary Gazette*. Subsequently, the *Literature Heritage* column of the *Enlightenment Daily* also published the two youths' refutation of Yu Pingbo's book *Research on "Dream of the Red Chamber"*. It seems that the struggle against the bourgeois idealism of the Hu Shi clique, which has been poisoning the youth for over thirty years in the realm of classical literature, may finally be able to commence. This initiative was taken by two "insignificant individuals," while "important figures" often overlook it and even obstruct it. They form a united front with bourgeois writers on idealism and willingly become captives of the bourgeoisie, similar to the situation during the screenings of the films *The Secret History of the Forbidden City* and *The Story of Wu Xun*. The film *The Secret History of the Forbidden City*, which was hailed as a patriotic film but was actually a traitorous film, has not been criticized since its nationwide release. Although *The Story of Wu Xun* was criticized, no lessons have been drawn, and now there is the strange occurrence of tolerating Yu Pingbo's idealism and obstructing the lively critical articles of "insignificant individuals," which is worth our attention.

Yu Pingbo and his ilk, these bourgeois intellectuals, should indeed be treated with a policy of unity, but their erroneous thoughts that poison the youth must be criticized. We should not surrender to them.

    关于红楼梦研究问题的信
    （一九五四年十月十六日）
    毛泽东
    驳俞平伯的两篇文章附上，请一阅。这是三十多年以来向所谓红楼梦研究权威作家的错误观点的第一次认真的开火。作者是两个青年团员。他们起初写信给《文艺报》，请问可不可以批评俞平伯，被置之不理。他们不得已写信给他们的母校——山东大学的老师，获得了支持，并在该校刊物《文史哲》上登出了他们的文章驳《红楼梦简论》。问题又回到北京，有人要求将此文在《人民日报》上转载，以期引起争论，展开批评，又被某些人以种种理由（主要是“小人物的文章”，“党报不是自由辩论的场所”）给以反对，不能实现；结果成立妥协，被允许在《文艺报》转载此文。嗣后，《光明日报》的《文学遗产》栏又发表了这两个青年的驳俞平伯《红楼梦研究》一书的文章。看样子，这个反对在古典文学领域毒害青年三十余年的胡适派资产阶级唯心论的斗争，也许可以开展起来了。事情是两个“小人物”做起来的，而“大人物”往往不注意，并往往加以阻拦，他们同资产阶级作家在唯心论方面讲统一战线，甘心作资产阶级的俘虏，这同影片《清宫秘史》和《武训传》放映时候的情形几乎是相同的。被人称为爱国主义影片而实际是卖国主义影片的《清宫秘史》，在全国放映之后，至今没有被批判。《武训传》虽然批判了，却至今没有引出教训，又出现了容忍俞平伯唯心论和阻拦“小人物”的很有生气的批判文章的奇怪事情，这是值得我们注意的。
    俞平伯这一类资产阶级知识分子，当然是应当对他们采取团结态度的，但应当批判他们的毒害青年的错误思想，不应当对他们投降。	这是毛泽东同志写给中共中央政治局的同志和其他有关同志的一封信。
