Tokyo, May 3 (Xinhua) - The second issue of "Youth Warrior," the organ of the left-wing committee of the Democratic Youth League of Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan, recently published an article by Honda Shin. The article states: Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is an "invincible and unparalleled theory of victory in a hundred battles." This theory emerged from the longest, most profound, and most experienced victorious struggle led by the proletariat in contemporary world history. Japanese youth should internalize Chairman Mao's theory of people's war and actively apply Comrade Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War" to thoroughly defeat the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan and the revisionists.

The article says: "The series of theories and policies on people's war are primarily the creative developments and enrichments of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao Zedong. They are powerful weapons for the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world." The great victory of the Chinese revolution has greatly changed the balance of power in the world. "The theory of people's war is not only a revolutionary weapon for the Chinese people but has also become a common treasure for revolutionary peoples around the world."

Currently, U.S. imperialism is madly expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam. "However, the heroic Vietnamese people and youth, armed with the weapon of people's war, are bravely fighting a life-and-death struggle against U.S. imperialism and are steadily winning victory."

Not only in Vietnam, but also in Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines, armed struggles have made new advances. In various parts of Africa and Latin America, armed struggles are also flourishing. These are all victories achieved by actively applying the theory of people's war.

The article says: "For Japanese youth fighting for the liberation of their homeland, it is extremely important to deeply study the invincible theory of people's war, which was established through a long history of struggle and bitter sacrifices, and to firmly grasp it as an ideological weapon."

When discussing the importance of the mass line in people's war, the article says: "War is fought by the people, relying on the wisdom and fearless fighting spirit of the people." During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Communist Party of China relied on the broadest masses of the people, united all possible anti-Japanese forces, and insisted on strengthening and expanding the anti-Japanese national united front. This basic line is to mobilize the masses, strengthen the people's forces, and defeat the invaders under the leadership of the Party.

The article emphasizes that in fighting people's war, it is crucial to highlight politics. "In the War of Resistance Against Japan, why could the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, with inferior weapons, defeat the enemy? It is because they were armed with the idea of putting political work first. This is the basic spirit of Chairman Mao Zedong's military thought." Vietnam is another example. The heavily armed U.S. aggressors were defeated by the brave people and soldiers of South Vietnam. "No matter how advanced modern weapons and technology are, the ultimate victory or defeat of a war is determined by people's awareness, courage, and spirit of sacrifice."

The article says: "Based on the experience of China's people's war, Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in a very profound way: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' He also said: 'The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war.'" Therefore, to oppose anti-people's war with people's war, to seize power with revolutionary violence.

The article exposes the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party who abandon struggle and believe in the parliamentary road. The theory that revolution is close to success when the majority is held in parliament is a "counter-revolutionary theory that abandons the dictatorship of the proletariat." It is necessary to thoroughly expose this vicious deception and conspiracy and systematically instill the idea of violent revolution in the broad masses of young people.

The article calls on Japanese revolutionary youth to "deeply study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards victory, turn the idea of serving the people into flesh and blood, and become a brave and fighting young rebel." "The glorious future definitely belongs to us youth." "Long live the victory of people's war!"

    日本《青年战士》号召青年学习毛主席的人民战争理论
    光辉的人民战争思想天下无敌
    据新华社讯　东京消息：最近出版的日本民主青年同盟山口县委员会（左派）机关刊物《青年战士》第二期发表了波多进写的一篇文章。文章指出：毛主席关于人民战争的理论，“是百战百胜的天下无敌的理论”。这个理论是在当代世界上无产阶级领导下的、时间最长的、最深入的、经验最丰富的胜利斗争中产生的。日本青年应把毛主席的人民战争的理论化为自己的血和肉，并活学活用林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》的文章，来彻底打倒美日反动派和修正主义者。
    文章说：“关于人民战争的一系列理论和政策，首先是毛泽东主席创造性地发展和丰富了马克思列宁主义的产物，是世界被压迫民族和人民进行革命斗争的强大武器。”中国革命的伟大胜利，极大地改变了世界的力量对比，“人民战争的理论不仅是中国人民的革命武器，而且成了全世界革命人民的共同财富。”
    现在美帝国主义在越南正在疯狂地扩大侵略战争，“但是，英雄的越南人民和青年拿起人民战争这个武器，英勇地同美帝国主义进行殊死的斗争，并且牢靠地赢得胜利。”
    不仅在越南，就是在老挝、泰国、马来亚和菲律宾的武装斗争，也都取得新的进展。在非洲和拉丁美洲各地，武装斗争也在蓬勃发展。这些“全是活学活用人民战争理论以后取得的胜利”。
    文章说：“我们深入地学习在长期斗争历史和残酷的流血牺牲中建立起来的无往不胜的理论——人民战争的理论，作为思想武器牢牢地加以掌握，这对于为争取祖国的解放而斗争的日本青年来说，是极为重要的。”
    文章在谈到群众路线在人民战争中的重要意义时说：“战争是人民打的，是依靠人民的智慧和无所畏惧的战斗精神进行的。”“中国共产党在抗日战争中依靠最广大的人民群众，团结一切可以团结的抗日力量，坚持加强和扩大抗日民族统一战线。这条基本路线就是放手发动群众，壮大人民力量，在党的领导下打败侵略者。”
    文章强调打人民战争必须注意突出政治。“在抗日战争中，为什么八路军和新四军能以低劣的武器装备打败敌人？就是因为它们是用政治工作第一的思想武装起来的。这是毛泽东主席建军思想的基本精神。”越南也是一个例子。武装到牙齿的美国侵略军被英勇的越南南方军民打得落花流水。“不论现代武器和技术装备多么发达，战争的最后胜败，归根结底，是由人的觉悟、勇敢和牺牲精神来决定的。”
    文章说：“毛泽东主席根据中国的人民战争经验，极其精辟地指出：‘枪杆子里面出政权。’他还说：‘革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。’”因此，要以人民的战争反对反人民的战争，要用革命的暴力来夺取政权。
    文章在揭露日共修正主义分子放弃斗争、迷信议会道路时指出，那种所谓在国会里占有多数而革命就接近成功的理论，“是放弃无产阶级专政的反革命理论”，“必须彻底揭露这种恶毒的大骗局、大阴谋，有系统地向广大青年灌输暴力革命的思想。”
    文章号召日本革命青年“必须深入地学习在帝国主义走向全面崩溃、社会主义走向胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，把为人民服务的观点变成自己的血和肉，而成为一个勇敢战斗的青年造反者。”“光辉的未来一定属于我们青年。”“人民战争胜利万岁！”
