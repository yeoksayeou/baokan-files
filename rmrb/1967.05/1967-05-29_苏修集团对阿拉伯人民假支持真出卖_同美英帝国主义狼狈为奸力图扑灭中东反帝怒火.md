The Soviet revisionist clique's hypocritical support and betrayal of the Arab people
Colluding with American and British imperialism to extinguish the anti-imperialist flames in the Middle East

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, Moscow: Just as the Arab people are united in their resolute struggle against the aggression and war threats of American imperialism and its tool, Israel, the British Foreign Secretary George Brown, at the invitation of the Soviet revisionist leadership, visited Moscow from the 23rd to the 26th. He conspired with the Soviet authorities to plot a dirty deal, attempting to sabotage the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle.

Starting from the day after Brown arrived in Moscow, the Soviet leaders Kosygin, Podgorny, and the Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held a series of lengthy discussions and talks with Brown in a "friendly atmosphere" regarding the current situation in the Middle East. According to a Reuters report, before Brown left Moscow to return to Britain on the 26th, he said at a press conference in Moscow that their discussions on this issue were "very thorough, very detailed, and extremely friendly," and that they were "constructive." He said that the basis of this meeting was "more about how we can prevent a big fire from breaking out rather than the right and wrong of the matter." "We are all concerned with ensuring that a big fire does not break out."

The day after Brown returned to Britain, the British newspaper *Daily Mirror* published a report revealing that the so-called "prevention of a big fire from breaking out" by the Soviets and the British was a plot by the imperialists and revisionists to extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-imperialist struggle. The newspaper reported that the British Foreign Secretary had returned from Moscow with a "secret assurance" from Russia to help calm the Middle East crisis. "Undoubtedly, the Soviet leaders are making urgent behind-the-scenes attempts to restrain Egypt (the UAR)." The British *Daily Telegraph* also reported on the 26th, quoting a "Soviet official" on the 25th, saying: "Russia will 'cautiously' use its influence to prevent a war between Egypt and Israel."

According to Western news agencies, before Brown's visit to the Soviet Union, the Johnson administration had secretly communicated with the Soviet revisionist leadership, asking it to "cooperate" with the United States on the Middle East issue and to "use its influence." The information leaked from behind the scenes about this Soviet-British meeting shows that the Washington masters made such a request, and the Soviet revisionist henchmen did as they were told. From this, one can clearly see that the Soviet authorities' statement a few days ago, claiming to "assist" the Arab people's struggle and to take "resolute anti-aggression actions" against those who "launch aggression" in the Middle East, is nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing, hypocritical support and actual betrayal.

According to reports, during this Soviet-British meeting, Kosygin and others also discussed the Vietnam issue, the prevention of nuclear proliferation, and the so-called "European security issue" with Brown.

Regarding the Vietnam issue, according to Western news agencies, Brown mentioned this issue at his press conference on the 26th, saying that the Soviet Union's current thoughts on the Vietnam issue were "more or less the same" as those of Premier Kosygin during his visit to London in February. The Soviet "hopes to find a solution, just like us." This means that the Soviet revisionist leadership, as in the past, is eager to serve the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam, sabotaging the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

    苏修集团对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖
    同美英帝国主义狼狈为奸力图扑灭中东反帝怒火
    据新华社二十八日讯  莫斯科消息：正当阿拉伯各国人民一致奋起坚决同美帝国主义及其工具以色列的侵略和战争威胁作斗争的时候，英国外交大臣布朗应苏修领导集团的邀请，于二十三日到二十六日访问莫斯科，同苏修当局共同策划肮脏的交易，妄图破坏阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争。
    从布朗到达莫斯科的第二天起，苏修头目柯西金、波德戈尔内和苏联外长葛罗米柯，先后同布朗在“友好的气氛中”，就中东目前的局势进行了一系列长时间的会谈、讨论。据路透社报道，布朗二十六日离苏回国以前在莫斯科记者招待会上说，他们之间关于这一问题的讨论是“十分充分、十分详尽、极为友好”，而且“是建设性的”。他说，这次会谈所根据的“与其说是这件事的是非曲直，不如说是我们如何才能制止大火的爆发”。“我们大家都关心的是确保不爆发大火。”
    在布朗回到英国以后的第二天，英国《每日镜报》刊登的一篇报道，透露了苏英的所谓“制止大火的爆发”，就是帝修狼狈为奸，共同策划扑灭阿拉伯人民反帝斗争烈火。这家报纸说，英国外交大臣从莫斯科“带回了俄国协助平息中东危机的秘密保证。”“毫无疑问，苏联领导人在进行紧急的幕后尝试来约制埃及（即阿联）”。英国的《每日电讯报》在二十六日也发表消息，援引“苏联官员”二十五日的话报道说：“俄国将‘慎重地’利用它的影响避免埃及同以色列的战争”。
    据西方通讯社报道，在布朗访苏之前，约翰逊政府曾暗地里向苏修领导集团私通信息，要它同美国在中东问题上“合作”，“运用它的影响”。上面从幕后透露出来的关于这次苏英会谈的情况说明，华盛顿主子这么要求，苏修帮凶们也就这么干了。从这里人们可以清楚地看出，苏修当局几天前发表“声明”，声称要“帮助”阿拉伯人民的斗争，要对在中东地区“发动侵略的人”采取什么“坚决的反侵略行动”等等，不过是挂羊头卖狗肉，假支持真出卖而已。
    据报道，在这次苏英会谈中，柯西金等人还同布朗讨论了越南问题、防止核扩散问题以及所谓“欧洲安全问题”。
    关于越南问题，据西方通讯社报道，布朗在二十六日的记者招待会上谈到这个问题时说，苏联现在对越南问题的想法“跟柯西金总理二月间访问伦敦时的想法‘差不多’”，苏联“跟我们一样很希望找到解决的办法”。这就是说，苏修领导集团同过去一样，要加紧为美国的侵越政策效劳，破坏越南人民的抗美救国斗争。
