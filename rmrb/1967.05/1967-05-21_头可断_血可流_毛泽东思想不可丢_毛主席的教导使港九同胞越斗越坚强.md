The teaching of Chairman Mao has made the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon stronger in their struggle.

About 700 representatives from various circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a meeting on the afternoon of May 19 to angrily denounce the bloody suppression of patriotic compatriots by the British authorities in Hong Kong. They extended their warmest condolences to workers and compatriots who were illegally arrested and brutally beaten by the British authorities. The representatives unanimously swore: "Head may be cut off, blood may flow, but Mao Zedong Thought must not be abandoned. We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle and are determined to win the final victory in the struggle against persecution."

The meeting began with the stirring music of "The East Is Red." A large portrait of Chairman Mao hung prominently in the center of the stage. The attendees held red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and wore shining Mao badges, each with a spirit of fighting. The meeting was conducted in an atmosphere of indignation and excitement from beginning to end, with slogans and revolutionary songs echoing throughout the venue.

Chairman Yang Guang spoke first. He said that the British authorities in Hong Kong had orchestrated the bloody violence and deliberately expanded it, fully exposing the conspiracy of British imperialism in collusion with U.S. imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits to oppose China and suppress the influence of Mao Zedong Thought. The British authorities in Hong Kong foolishly attempted to use savage repression to suppress the high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, which is sheer fantasy. The people of Hong Kong and Kowloon have organized themselves to fight against persecution, with the support of 700 million people nationwide. Chairman Mao is our strongest backing. The just struggle of the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon will certainly be victorious.

Many workers, teachers, medical workers, and film workers recounted their personal experiences, angrily denouncing the British authorities' heinous crimes of illegal arrest, brutal beating, illegal interrogation, and illegal sentencing. Some of them were still bandaged, and some were seriously injured and had to be carried into the venue on stretchers. These bloodstained evidence of the British authorities' crimes aroused the representatives' extreme indignation.

The attendees pointed out that in the face of the thugs, the patriotic compatriots showed no sign of cowardice. They relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the enemy head-on. They learned and applied it in the struggle, becoming stronger and wiser with each fight.

An injured worker said that in prison, we missed Chairman Mao the most and needed Mao Zedong Thought the most. Whenever we had the chance to gather, we studied the quotations from Chairman Mao and the "Three Constantly Read Articles." Even when our "treasured books" were confiscated, we taught and learned from each other by memory. Everyone in prison remembered Chairman Mao's words: "We die for the people, and it is a worthy death." Chairman Mao's teachings gave us strength, making us even more courageous to fight against the British authorities in Hong Kong. In prison, we also sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and told stories of revolutionary martyrs to encourage each other's fighting spirit. To express our boundless love for Chairman Mao, we made five-pointed stars out of "Red Double Happiness" cigarette packs and stuck them on the prison walls with toothpaste. In prison, we propagated Mao Zedong Thought and taught other prisoners to sing songs of quotations, turning the prison into a classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

The workers said that when we were being taken to the "court," we sang "Strive for Victory" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" on the boat and in the car, shouting slogans. We walked with our heads held high and chests out into the "court," angrily confronting the "paper tiger" in the British authorities' "court."

A worker from the artificial flower factory, Xiao Jianhui, who was severely beaten in prison, was so seriously injured that he insisted on being carried on a stretcher to the stage to denounce the British authorities' atrocities. He said, "The enemy did not allow me to read Chairman Mao's quotations, but I insisted on reading. I read, 'Resolutely, fearlessly, overcoming all difficulties, strive for victory.' Every sentence I read, the enemy's sticks would beat me wildly. When I read 'strive for victory,' I was already beaten to the point of vomiting blood. I sprayed my blood on the enemy. I told the enemy, even if you beat me to death, I will still read. I will turn my blood into strength and fight down the 'paper tiger'!" After speaking these words with extreme indignation, he fainted. After a while, when he woke up, he used all his strength to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party of China!"

The attendees were all filled with anger and hatred, swallowing their tears. When Xiao Jianhui was carried out of the venue, the people's anger turned into surging waves of slogans: "Protest the illegal beating of our compatriots! Blood for blood! Unite and fight to the end!" The representatives also read aloud Chairman Mao's quotations: "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests ahead of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward on their bloodstained path!"

At the end of the meeting, more than 80 anti-violence warriors from the Hong Kong artificial flower factory came on stage to receive everyone's condolences. The entire venue sang "Strive for Victory" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," repeatedly raising their arms to shout: "Down with British imperialism! Long live the great unity of the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon in their patriotic struggle! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, long live, and ten thousand years live our great leader Chairman Mao!"

    头可断　血可流　毛泽东思想不可丢
    毛主席的教导使港九同胞越斗越坚强
    各界代表集会愤怒控诉港英当局的血腥暴行，向被害爱国同胞致最亲切的慰问
    据新华社香港二十日电　港九各界同胞代表约七百人十九日下午集会，愤怒控诉香港英国当局血腥镇压我爱国同胞的法西斯暴行。向被港英当局无理逮捕并遭残酷殴打的工人和同胞致最亲切慰问。到会代表一致宣誓：头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢，一定要在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，誓夺反迫害斗争的最后胜利。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。讲台正中高悬毛主席的巨幅画像。出席代表手持红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，个个斗志昂扬。大会自始至终在愤怒激昂的气氛中进行，口号声和革命歌声响彻全场。
    大会主席杨光首先讲话。他说，港英当局一手制造了血腥暴行，并且蓄意把它扩大，完全是英帝国主义勾结美帝、蒋匪帮反对中国，遏制毛泽东思想影响的阴谋的一次大暴露。港英当局妄想用野蛮镇压的手段，把港九同胞掀起的活学活用毛主席著作高潮压下去，这完全是痴心妄想。港九同胞已经组织起来，进行反迫害斗争，全国七亿人民在支持我们，毛主席做我们最强大的靠山，港九同胞的正义斗争必定会取得胜利。
    许多工人、教师、医务工作者和电影工作者通过他们的亲身经历，愤怒地控诉港英当局无理拘捕、残酷殴打、非法审讯和非法判罪的滔天罪行。他们有些人身上还缠着绷带，有的身负重伤，由别人用担架抬进会场。港英当局这些血的罪证引起代表们的无比愤慨。
    到会的代表们指出，在暴徒面前，爱国同胞们没有表现出丝毫的怯懦，他们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，同敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，越斗越坚强，越斗越聪明。
    受伤的工人说，在狱中，我们最想念毛主席，最需要的是毛泽东思想。我们一有机会聚集在一起，就学习毛主席语录，学习“老三篇”。我们身上带的“宝书”被搜去，大家就凭记忆，互相教，互相学。大家在狱中都牢记着毛主席这样一段话：“我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”毛主席的教导使我们浑身是劲，更加勇气百倍地跟港英当局进行斗争。我们在狱中还唱毛主席语录歌，讲革命先烈故事，互相鼓舞斗志。为了表示我们对毛主席的无限热爱，我们把“红双喜”香烟包做成五角金星，用牙膏贴在牢房的墙上。我们在狱中宣传毛泽东思想，教狱中其他难友唱语录歌，把监狱变成了活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂。
    工人们说，当我们在被带往“法庭”的途中，我们在船上、车上高唱《争取胜利》、《大海航行靠舵手》，高呼口号。我们昂首阔步，挺起胸膛步入“法庭”，在港英当局的“法庭”中怒审“纸老虎”。
    在狱中被毒打的人造花厂工人萧剑辉，伤势极其严重，但他坚持要用担架把他送上讲台，躺在床上向大家控诉港英当局的暴行。他说：“敌人不准我读毛主席语录，我偏要读。我读‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’我每读一句，敌人的棍子就往我身上乱打一顿，当我读到‘去争取胜利’时，已被打至吐血，我把血喷到敌人身上。我对敌人说，你就是打死我，我也要读，我要把鲜血化为力量，斗垮‘纸老虎’！”他在台上怀着极其激愤的心情讲完这些话以后就昏迷过去了，过了一会，当他醒来时，用尽全身力气高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    在场同胞个个怒火满腔，同仇敌忾，他们把眼泪吞了下去。当萧剑辉被抬出会场时，人们的愤怒化成汹涌澎湃的口号声：“抗议非法毒打我同胞！”“血债血偿！”“团结起来，斗争到底！”代表们并且齐声朗读毛主席语录：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
    会议最后，香港人造花厂的八十多名抗暴战士上台接受大家的慰问，全场高歌《争取胜利》、《大海航行靠舵手》，一再振臂高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“港九同胞爱国大团结万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
