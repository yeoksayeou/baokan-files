The various ethnic groups in Guangxi Province, both in urban and rural areas, as well as coastal defense forces, strongly condemn the heinous crime of American imperialist bandit planes invading our Ningming County in the south and bombing our territory, destroying houses and farmland.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 4th: The revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, students, cadres, and broad masses of militia in the capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Nanning, were extremely indignant upon hearing the news of American bandit planes invading Ningming County in the south and bombing our territory. They immediately held meetings to denounce the crimes of the American bandits. The militia members angrily said: The American imperialists owe the Chinese people a mountain of blood debts, and we must settle accounts with them. We are militia members armed with Mao Zedong Thought, the reserve force of the People's Liberation Army. If the American imperialists dare to impose war on the Chinese people, we will annihilate them in the vast ocean of people's war. Revolutionary workers expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's works diligently, grasp the revolution, and promote production, supporting the People's Liberation Army with practical actions to give the American bandits a resounding defeat. In the storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards, who are fiercely attacking the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, said: In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we strike at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and it hurts the hearts of the American imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leading clique. They are desperate and trying to threaten us with military provocations, but they will have no good outcome; they will only end up hurting themselves. We are Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards, the reserve force of the heroic People's Liberation Army. We dare to climb mountains of knives and walk through seas of fire. If the American imperialists dare to invade, as long as our supreme commander Chairman Mao gives the order, we will join the heroic Liberation Army to smash the American imperialists to pieces.

The militia members along the Beilun River in Dongxing County of the various ethnic autonomous counties cheered for our air force's three victories in three battles and, at a meeting denouncing the crime of American bandit planes bombing, read aloud Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must never relax our vigilance against the cunning plots of revenge by the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of our victories." They expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the revolution, promote preparedness for war, production, and work, tightly grip their rifles, and be ready to strike back at any invading enemy together with the heroic People's Liberation Army.

Nongqunying, a militia instructor from the Jiafeng Brigade of the Youyi Commune in Pingxiang City, who has studied Chairman Mao's works diligently, angrily said, "We militia members must tightly grip our rifles, actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to support the army and love the people, and guard the border with the heroic People's Liberation Army."

The revolutionary masses of the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups in Ningming County, Guangxi, which have been bombed by American bandit planes, held meetings and demonstrations on the 2nd and 3rd to strongly denounce the heinous crime of American imperialist bandit planes invading our airspace and bombing our territory. They firmly support the strong protest and warning issued by our Ministry of National Defense against the American imperialists. They expressed their determination to firmly respond to the great call of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, grasp the revolution, promote preparedness for war, work, and production, maintain high vigilance at all times, tightly grip their rifles, stand in strict readiness, and if the American imperialists dare to impose war on us, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them.

    美帝欠下的累累血债一定要清算   
    广西各族人民愤怒谴责美帝轰炸我领土的滔天罪行
    据新华社南宁四日电 广西壮族自治区城乡各地和海边防的各族人民、民兵和红卫兵小将，愤怒谴责美帝国主义强盗飞机悍然侵入我广西宁明县南部地区投弹轰炸，破坏民房和耕地的滔天罪行。
    自治区首府南宁市的革命工人、革命农民、红卫兵小将、革命师生、机关干部和广大民兵，听到美国强盗飞机侵入我宁明县南部地区投弹轰炸的消息后，无比愤慨，立即举行集会，声讨美国强盗的罪行。民兵们愤怒地说：美帝国主义对中国人民欠下了累累血债，我们一定要同它清算。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的民兵，是解放军的后备军，美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加到中国人民头上，我们就把它消灭在人民战争的汪洋大海中。革命派的工人们表示，要努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，以实际行动支援人民解放军，狠狠打击美国强盗。在无产阶级文化大革命的风暴里，正在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行猛攻的红卫兵小将们说：在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们打在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上，痛在美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义领导集团的心上。他们狗急跳墙，妄想用军事挑衅来威胁我们，是绝对没有好下场的，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。我们是毛主席的红小兵，是英雄的人民解放军的后备军，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯，美帝国主义胆敢来犯，只要我们的最高统帅毛主席一声令下，我们将同英雄的解放军一起，把美帝国主义打个稀巴烂。
    在北仑河畔东兴各族自治县的民兵们，在阵地上欢呼我空军部队三战三捷，并在声讨美国强盗飞机投弹轰炸罪行的集会上，高声朗读毛主席的教导：我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性。他们表示要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓革命，促战备、促生产、促工作，紧握手中枪，同英雄的人民解放军一起，准备随时打击来犯的敌人。
    凭祥市学习毛主席著作积极分子、友谊公社卡凤大队民兵副教导员农群英愤怒地说，我们民兵要握紧枪杆，积极响应毛主席拥军爱民的伟大号召，和英雄的人民解放军共守边防。
    遭到过美国强盗轰炸的广西宁明县的壮族、汉族革命群众，二、三日连续举行集会和游行示威，愤怒声讨美帝国主义强盗飞机侵入我国领空，悍然投弹轰炸的滔天罪行，坚决拥护我国国防部发言人对美帝国主义提出的强烈抗议和警告。他们表示，最坚决响应我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产，时刻提高警惕，紧握手中枪，严阵以待，如果美帝国主义胆敢把战争强加在我们头上，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把它消灭掉。
