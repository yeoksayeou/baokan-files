The leadership of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Railway Corps held a grand ceremony on May 15 to confer the honorable title of "Iron-Boned Soldier of the Railway Corps" on Zhang Chunyu, a deputy squad leader of a certain unit in the Railway Corps, according to an order from the Ministry of National Defense.

The meeting began with the solemn singing of "The East is Red." The attendees collectively recited Chairman Mao's words: "Our Communist Party and the Communist-led Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the people's liberation, and it works thoroughly for the people's interests."

Attendees included leaders of the Railway Corps, representatives of advanced collectives, and a large number of soldiers and officers from the Railway Corps stationed in Beijing. Zhang Chunyu, who was injured while saving a comrade in June 1965, has gradually recovered after two years of treatment. Today, as he walked onto the stage, the entire audience applauded enthusiastically.

Chui Tianmin, a leader of the Railway Corps, first read the order from the Ministry of National Defense conferring the title of "Iron-Boned Soldier of the Railway Corps" on Zhang Chunyu on behalf of the Ministry. He then presented the certificate to Zhang Chunyu.

Chui Tianmin, representing the Party Committee and the leadership of the Railway Corps, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Zhang Chunyu's ability to become a red flag in the Railway Corps is entirely the result of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. We learn from Zhang Chunyu to resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's great directive that the People's Liberation Army should be a revolutionary school, to experience the wind and rain in the fiery class struggle, to raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, to run the Mao Zedong Thought school better, to create more and higher-level four-good platoons, to cultivate more Zhang Chunyu-like five-good soldiers, and to foster tens of thousands of new people of communism."

Chui Tianmin said, "At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is at a crucial moment of launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We must stand at the forefront of the struggle and, together with the broad revolutionary masses, hoist high the banner of criticizing and repudiating reactionary bourgeois ideology, deeply expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the Party's top power-holder taking the capitalist road, especially to seriously criticize his poisonous weed 'Self-Cultivation,' eliminate its influence, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions."

Chui Tianmin called on all soldiers and officers of the Railway Corps to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call, bravely, responsibly, actively, and resolutely complete the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training. Firmly implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote preparedness, promote work, and promote production," and successfully complete all glorious tasks of revolution, preparedness, and railway construction.

After the representatives of the advanced collectives and the representatives of Zhang Chunyu's platoon spoke, Zhang Chunyu spoke with great emotion. He sincerely wished our heart's red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! He also wished the great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao, good health!

Zhang Chunyu said: "I am the son of a poor peasant. Today, I have become a glorious revolutionary soldier and a Communist Party member, knowing how to do something for the people, entirely thanks to the nurturing of great Mao Zedong Thought. Ten thousand words cannot express my boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao. The heavens and the earth cannot contain my boundless respect and love for Chairman Mao."

In his speech, Zhang Chunyu, combining his own experiences, angrily denounced the Party's top power-holder taking the capitalist road and his poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation." He said, "The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is the source of strength for our revolutionary soldiers and the family treasure that ensures the proletarian state will never change color. The head can be cut off, the life can be given up, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned! Whoever opposes Chairman Mao will be overthrown!"

Zhang Chunyu finally expressed that he would definitely take Chairman Mao's teaching of "being humble makes one progress, being arrogant makes one fall behind" as his motto, always remain humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, and always maintain the red flag.

The meeting ended with the resounding slogan of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and the singing of "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman."

    铁道兵部队负责人号召全体指战员最热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，勇敢地、坚决地完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣任务。
    新华社十五日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵领导机关，十五日在北京隆重举行命名大会，根据国防部命令，授予铁道兵某部副班长张春玉以“铁道兵硬骨头战士”的光荣称号。
    大会在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始。参加大会的指战员，集体高声朗读毛主席语录：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”
    参加大会的有铁道兵部队负责人，先进集体的代表和铁道兵驻京部队广大指战员。张春玉同志在一九六五年六月为抢救战友光荣负伤后，经过两年来的治疗，伤情逐渐好转，今天当他走上主席台时，全场热烈鼓掌。
    铁道兵部队负责人崔田民，首先代表国防部宣读了授予张春玉以“铁道兵硬骨头战士”称号的命令，并代表国防部把奖状授给张春玉。
    崔田民代表铁道兵党委和领导机关，在会上讲话。他说，张春玉同志能够成为铁道兵部队一面红旗，完全是毛泽东思想哺育的结果。我们向张春玉学习，就是要坚决执行毛主席关于人民解放军应该是一个革命化大学校的伟大指示，在火热的阶级斗争中，经风雨，见世面，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，把毛泽东思想大学校办得更好，创造水平更高、数量更多的四好连队，培养更多的张春玉式的五好战士，造就成千上万的共产主义新人。
    崔田民说，目前无产阶级文化大革命，正处在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的关键时刻，我们一定要站在斗争的最前列，和广大革命群众一道，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，深入地揭露和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，特别要认真批判他的大毒草《修养》，肃清其流毒，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地。
    崔田民号召铁道兵全体指战员，最热烈地响应毛主席的伟大号召，勇敢地、负责地、积极地、坚决地完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣任务。坚决贯彻“抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产”的方针，圆满完成革命、战备和铁路建设等各项光荣任务。
    在先进集体的代表和张春玉所在连队的代表讲话以后，张春玉怀着激动的心情讲了话。他衷心敬祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！敬祝伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副主席身体健康！
    张春玉说：我是一个贫苦农民的儿子，今天能够成为一个光荣的革命战士、共产党员，懂得为人民做一些事情，完全是伟大的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。千言万语说不尽我对毛主席的无限忠诚，天大地大容纳不下我对毛主席的无限崇敬和无限热爱的深情。
    张春玉在讲话中，结合自己成长的体会，愤怒声讨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的大毒草《修养》。他说，光辉的毛泽东思想是我们革命战士成长的力量源泉，是保证无产阶级的江山永不变色的传家宝。头可断，命可舍，毛泽东思想不可丢！谁反对毛主席，就打倒谁！
    张春玉最后表示，一定要把毛主席“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的教导当作座右铭，永远谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，永远保持鲜红的旗帜。
    大会在响亮的“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中胜利结束。
