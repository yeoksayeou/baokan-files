Advancing Along the Golden Path Indicated by Chairman Mao

Yin Guanglan
Member of the Dianpu Commune, Feidong County, Anhui

On the 25th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," I studied this brilliant work again and felt particularly close to it. Comparing it with the path I have walked, I deeply feel that any small achievements I have made in folk song creation are not due to my own abilities, but because Chairman Mao has shown us a golden path.

I am a peasant woman who was raised as a child bride. From a young age, I loved singing folk songs. However, the evil old society was like a big lock, locking my throat, preventing me from singing loudly! I will never forget the year 1949 when we were liberated! Chairman Mao came! The clouds parted, and we saw the red sun. This poor person also stood up and could sing freely. To express my love for the Party and Chairman Mao, I sang all these feelings in folk songs.

After the commune was established in 1952, our amateur creation activities became more active. We often had song contests in the rice fields, work songs in the fields, singing competitions on the ridges, and evening performances in the fields. The songs were everywhere. The songs we sang were full of the scent of the earth and were in the local dialect, which the farmers could completely understand. Our songs played a certain role in raising the class consciousness of the commune members and promoting production. Starting in 1956, newspapers began to publish some of our songs. At that time, we couldn't believe that the yangko, which was looked down upon before liberation, could now be in the newspapers! It was at this time that someone read "Talks" to us. Chairman Mao's words were deeply moving. With Chairman Mao's support, we, these people with muddy legs, dared to step onto the stage of literature and art.

The Party knew that I had no education, and holding a pen was much heavier than holding a hoe, so they sent me to school. In 1960, I could just read newspapers, and I read "Talks" with tears of excitement, word by word. This was the first time I read this brilliant work myself, and I felt that I had stood higher, seen farther, had a direction for holding a pen, and the path was clear. Chairman Mao said: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and used by the workers, peasants, and soldiers." This is the only correct path indicated by Chairman Mao, and we must advance firmly in this direction.

In the process of creating folk songs, I also took a detour. For a period, the number of my works that were rejected increased, and some "authorities" with good intentions suggested that I should make my works more "beautiful." Listening to their words, I also felt that my works were indeed "rustic." I began to work on the "beauty." However, when I sang these songs to the commune members, the old poor peasants commented: "Your songs are not understandable to us now." I was very frustrated by this criticism, feeling like a rat in a windbox—receiving criticism from both sides. What should I do? I consulted "Talks" again. Chairman Mao said: "Anything must truly benefit the people before it is a good thing." He also said: "Popularization is for the people, and improvement is also for the people." These words deeply educated me, making me realize that it is wrong and impractical to improve oneself by closing the door and separating from reality and the struggle. I should not follow those "authorities" and pursue "beauty." With a clear understanding, I returned to the right path. Chairman Mao's words are indeed the beacon on my path!

The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are burning fiercely! In this fierce class struggle, I received another good tempering and realized that over the past 17 years, there has been a struggle between two lines in the field of literature and art in our country. The number one capitalist-roader in the Party, along with the revisionist heads of the literary and art circles such as Lu Dingyi and Zhou Yang, implemented a revisionist black line in the literary and art circles, using it to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and art line. They opposed literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, opposed us workers and peasants stepping onto the stage of literature and art, and opposed singing praises to the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. They dared to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, so we must rebel against them, overthrow them, and stomp on them so they can never rise again. The more they oppose us singing praises to Chairman Mao, the more we must sing. With boundless love for Chairman Mao and intense hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, I stood in the fields and walked on the streets, singing folk songs such as "Sing Loudly of the Red Sun," "Chairman Mao Paved the Long March Road," "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao," "The Flag Bearer is Chairman Mao," and "Long Live Chairman Mao."

Chairman Mao, we will sing of you forever. Your words, we will follow and carry out resolutely. The sea may dry up, and the stones may crumble, but our poor and lower-middle peasants' red hearts, loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, will never change from generation to generation. I will forever be a red propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought, advancing along the golden path indicated by Chairman Mao!

### 沿着毛主席指出的金色大道前进

    沿着毛主席指出的金色大道前进
    安徽肥东县店埠公社社员　殷光兰
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的时候，我再一次学习了这篇光辉著作，感到格外亲切。对照《讲话》，回头望望自己所走过的道路，我深深感到，我能够在民歌创作上取得一星半点的成绩，绝不是我自己有什么本事，而是因为毛主席他老人家给我们指出了一条金色大道。
    我是一个童养媳出身的农村妇女，从小就爱唱民歌。但是，万恶的旧社会象一把大锁，锁住了我的喉咙，使我不能放声歌唱！难忘的一九四九年啊，解放了！毛主席来了！拨开云雾见到了红太阳，我这个苦人儿也翻身了，能够自由地歌唱了。为了抒发我内心对党、对毛主席的热爱，我把这些统统用民歌唱了出来。
    一九五二年办社以后，我们的业余创作活动更加活跃了，经常有秧田对歌、田头号子、埂边赛唱和场地晚会，真是歌声遍野。我们唱的歌，句句都带着泥土香，句句都是家乡音，庄稼人完全听得懂。我们唱的歌，在提高社员阶级觉悟和推动生产方面，起了一定的作用。从一九五六年起，报刊上开始登我们创作的一些歌子。当时我们真不敢相信，解放前被人看不起的秧歌，如今也能上报！就在这时候，有人把《讲话》念给我们听了。毛主席说的话，我们句句入耳，越听越有劲，越听越激动。有毛主席撑腰，我们这些泥糊腿子就敢登上文艺舞台。
    党知道我没有文化，拿笔杆比拿锄头重得多，就送我上学堂。一九六○年，我刚刚能看书报，就含着泪水激动地一字一字地读完了《讲话》。第一次亲自读完这篇光辉著作，我感到站得高了，望得远了，拿起笔有方向了，路子明朗了。毛主席说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”这是毛主席他老人家为我们指出的唯一正确的道路，我们一定要坚定不移地朝着这个方向前进。
    在民歌创作过程中，我也走过弯路。有段时间，我写的东西被打退票的逐渐多了，于是某些“好心”的“权威”便建议我写东西要“美”一些。听了他们的话，我也觉得自己写的东西确是“土头土脑”的，就开始在“美”字上下功夫。但是我把这些下过“功夫”的歌子唱给社员们听，老贫农的评语是：“你现在的歌子我们听不懂了。”我吃了这个批评，心里很苦恼，觉得真是“老鼠钻风箱——两头受气”。怎么办呢？我再一次请教《讲话》。毛主席说：“任何一种东西，必须能使人民群众得到真实的利益，才是好的东西。”又说：“普及是人民的普及，提高也是人民的提高。”这些话，使我受到了深刻的教育，使我认识到，脱离实际、脱离斗争生活去闭门提高是错误的，行不通的，不能照那些“权威”说的那样，专门去追求什么“美”。认识明确了，我又走上了正道。毛主席啊，您的话真是我前进路上的明灯啊！
    无产阶级文化大革命的烈火熊熊地燃烧起来了！在这场激烈的阶级大搏斗中，我又受到一次很好的锻炼，认识到十七年来，我国文艺界一直存在着两条路线的斗争。党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派指使文艺界的修正主义头目陆定一、周扬等人，在文艺界贯彻了一条修正主义文艺黑线，用这来对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线。他们反对文艺为工农兵服务，反对我们工农兵登上文艺舞台，反对歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。他们胆敢反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，我们就要造他们的反，就要把他们打倒在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身。他们越是反对我们歌唱毛主席，我们越是要唱。我怀着对毛主席的无限热爱，怀着对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的强烈仇恨，站在田间，走上街头，先后唱出《放声高唱红太阳》、《毛主席铺出长征路》、《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》、《旗手就是毛主席》、《毛主席万万岁》等民歌。
    毛主席啊毛主席，我们要永远歌唱您。您的话，我们句句听从，坚决照办。海可枯，石可烂，我们贫下中农忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的红心，世世代代永不变。我要永远做一个毛泽东思想的红色宣传员，沿着毛主席指出的金色大道阔步前进！
