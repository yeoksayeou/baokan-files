The vast blue sky and surging waves. A fleet of majestic warships adorn the Huangpu River, making it exceptionally grand. This is the base of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's East Sea Fleet.

This is a heroic fleet nurtured and grown under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

Fourteen years ago, our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, personally boarded the 227th ship of this unit and spent four days and three nights with the naval soldiers. The naval soldiers, like sunflowers turning towards the sun, listened to the teachings of the great commander. Chairman Mao issued a great call to all the officers and soldiers of the fleet, to the entire navy, and to the people of the nation: "To oppose the aggression of imperialism, we must definitely build a powerful navy." Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, over the past fourteen years, the combat effectiveness of our people's navy has greatly increased. The officers and soldiers of the East Sea Fleet have repeatedly established meritorious deeds in defending the nation's maritime frontiers. On November 14, 1965, in the famous Chongwu Sea Battle, they achieved a glorious victory in just thirty minutes, sinking the American-Chiang Kai-shek warship "Yongchang" and damaging the "Yongtai."

The revolutionary masses of the Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Art Festival Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's recent call for supporting the military and loving the people. With hearts full of respect for the People's Liberation Army, they came here to perform and offer comfort. Every worker and Red Guard participating in the comfort performance felt that being able to come to the fleet base where our great leader Chairman Mao had personally boarded and to learn from and report to the heroic People's Liberation Army was a great honor and a great happiness.

That day, the wharf was filled with a warm atmosphere of military love for the people and people's love for the military, with the military and the people closely united under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, learning from and supporting each other. The bright sunlight dyed the wharf and the river surface a golden yellow. Slogans such as "Learn from the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army!" "Learn from the revolutionary masses!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" echoed across the river.

The Red Guards from Tongji University, who had fought side by side with the help of the PLA and achieved revolutionary unity, joyfully jumped onto the stage. They deeply loved the PLA. To express their gratitude to the PLA, they hurriedly rehearsed a batch of programs singing the praises of the PLA. They beat the war drums, clapped the wooden clappers, and sang passionately:

	Military loves the people, people love the military, military and people united in heart.
	Whoever dares to oppose the PLA,
	We will resolutely fight to the end!
	Military and people united as one,
	See who can defeat us!

The performance on the wharf was also a battle to fiercely attack the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party. The "August 1st Combat Propaganda Team" composed of revolutionary workers from the Shanghai Electric Welding Machine Factory performed programs they created themselves, such as "Portrait of the Number One Capitalist-Roader in Power Within the Party," powerfully exposing the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party. They expressed their determination to resolutely overthrow the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. They sang with strong and powerful voices:

	Pfft! You are not an old revolutionary,
	You are a fake revolutionary, a counter-revolutionary.
	We fear neither heaven nor earth,
	We dare to pull the wild ambition down from the horse!

The ugly face of the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party aroused the indignation of all the soldiers on the scene. The stage and the audience shouted in unison:

	"Thoroughly overthrow the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party!" This roar of anger showed the unshakable determination of the military and the people to pull the number one capitalist-roader in power within the Party down from the horse and make him step aside; this roar was the solemn vow of the military and the people to defend Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought to the death; this roar, like thunder, echoed across the vast sky over the Huangpu River.

The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought tightly connected the naval soldiers and the revolutionary soldiers. The naval soldiers warmly led the workers and the Red Guards to tour their warships. On the warships, on the wharf, and on the grass, they chatted in small groups. Sun Kaishan, the current deputy political instructor of the unit that participated in the Chongwu Sea Battle, excitedly introduced to the performing workers and revolutionary youths how they used the great Mao Zedong Thought to defeat the enemy on the battlefield. He said, "We deeply feel from actual combat: The sky is big, the earth is big, but nothing is as powerful as Mao Zedong Thought. The most important thing is to master Mao Zedong Thought." Guo Caicheng, who was injured in the Chongwu Sea Battle and still has enemy shrapnel in his chest, said: "To defend the ironclad socialist state of the proletariat, we fought to the death under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, annihilating them in the vast ocean. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party want our socialist state to change color, but we revolutionary soldiers will also fight to the death with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and we will not retreat until we achieve victory!"

The vivid narratives of the naval soldiers aroused the workers' and Red Guards' deep admiration and respect for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and also intensified their deep hatred for the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. They said: At this moment when the two classes, two roads, and two lines are in the final showdown, we must direct the spearhead of our struggle at the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, overthrow and expose them thoroughly, and smash their conspiracy to restore capitalism in China, so that Mao Zedong Thought can be passed down for generations to come!

    军民一心要把鲲鹏缚
    ——记上海市工农兵文艺会演小分队慰问东海舰队
    碧空万里，浪涛澎湃。一艘艘威武的舰艇，把黄浦江点缀得分外雄壮。这是中国人民解放军海军东海舰队某部驻地。
    这是一支在毛泽东思想哺育下成长壮大的英雄舰队！
    十四年前，我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，亲自登临这个部队的二二七舰，同海军战士一起，度过了四天三夜。海军战士们在毛主席身边，象葵花向阳，聆听了伟大统帅的教诲。毛主席向全舰指战员，向全国海军和全国人民发出伟大号召：“为了反对帝国主义的侵略，我们一定要建立强大的海军。”在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，十四年来，我人民海军的战斗力已经大大增强了。东海舰队的广大指战员为保卫祖国海防，多次建立功勋。一九六五年十一月十四日，他们在著名的崇武海战中，仅仅三十分钟内，就获得了击沉美蒋军舰“永昌号”和击伤“永泰号”的辉煌胜利。
    上海市工农兵文艺会演毛泽东思想宣传小分队的革命群众，热烈响应毛主席最近发出的拥军爱民的伟大号召，怀着对人民解放军无限崇敬的心情来到这里，作慰问演出。参加慰问演出的每一个工人、红卫兵小将都感到，能来到我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自登临过的舰队驻地，向英雄的人民解放军学习和作汇报演出，这是莫大的光荣，莫大的幸福。
    这天，码头上到处呈现出一片军爱民、民爱军，军民在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下紧密团结一致，互相学习、互相支援的热烈气氛。灿烂的阳光把码头和江面染得一片金黄。“向英雄的中国人民解放军学习！”“向无产阶级革命派学习！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的口号声，此起彼伏，震荡在江面的上空。
    曾经在解放军帮助下，相互并肩战斗，实现了革命大联合的同济大学，红卫兵小将们，欢快地跳上了舞台。他们无限爱戴解放军。为了感谢解放军，他们连夜赶排了一批歌唱解放军的节目。他们擂动战鼓，打响快板，满怀激情地唱道：
    军爱民，民爱军，军民团结心连心。
    谁敢反对解放军，
    我们坚决同他拚到底！
    军民团结如一人，
    试看天下谁能敌！
    码头上的演出，也是向党内头号走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的战斗。由上海电焊机厂革命派工人组成的“八一战斗宣传队”，演出了他们自己创作的《为党内头号走资本主义道路当权派画像》等节目，有力地揭露了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪恶活动，表达了坚决打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的决心。他们用坚强而雄劲有力的歌声唱道：
    呸！你不是一个老革命，
    你是一个假革命、反革命。
    我们天不怕地不怕，
    敢把野心家拉下马！
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的丑恶嘴脸，激起全场战士无比的愤怒，台上台下齐声高呼：
  “彻底打倒党内头号走资本主义道路当权派！”这愤怒的吼声，显示出军民团结一致，誓把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派拉下马、让他靠边站的不可动摇的决心；这吼声，是军民团结一致，誓死保卫毛主席、誓死保卫毛泽东思想的庄严誓言；这吼声，象漫天惊雷，轰响在黄浦江的万里晴空。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，把海军战士和革命派战士紧紧地连结在一起。海军战士们亲切地带领工人和红卫兵小将，参观了他们的舰艇。他们在舰艇上，在码头上，在草地上，三三两两地交谈。亲身参加崇武海战的这支部队的现任副指导员孙开山，激动地向演出的工人、革命小将们，介绍了他们怎样在战场上用伟大的毛泽东思想去战胜敌人的。他说，我们从实战中深深体会到：天大地大，不如毛泽东思想威力大，千重要万重要，掌握毛泽东思想最重要。在崇武海战中负了伤、至今胸中还留有敌人的弹片的顾才清说：为了保卫无产阶级的铁打江山，我们在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，同拿枪的敌人作过拚死斗争，把他们歼灭在汪洋大海中。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，妄想要我们的社会主义江山变色，我们革命战士，同样要以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同他们作拚死斗争，不胜利，决不收兵！
    海军战士的生动叙述，激起了工人和红卫兵小将对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限崇拜、无限敬仰的深厚感情，也更加增强了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的深仇大恨。他们说：在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线已经进入总决战的时刻，我们要把斗争的矛头集中地指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们批倒、批臭，彻底粉碎他们在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，让毛泽东思想千代、万代传下去！
