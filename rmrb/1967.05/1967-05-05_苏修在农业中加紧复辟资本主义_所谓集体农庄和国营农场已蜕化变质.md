Editor's Note: The Soviet revisionist clique is hurriedly restoring capitalism in agriculture. They are conducting experiments with "land allocation to groups" in state farms and collective farms, and vigorously developing private economies. They are pushing the "new system," which takes capitalist profit as its core, to restore capitalism thoroughly, into agriculture. The state-owned farms, which were originally under the ownership of the whole people, and the collective farms, which were under collective ownership, have now changed beyond recognition. There, capitalist forces are rampant, and a new rich peasant economy is developing. The so-called collective farms and state farms have gradually degenerated into capitalist farms and enterprises.

In today's Soviet countryside, all kinds of new bourgeois elements have emerged. Many leaders of farms and collective farms, along with their cronies, exploit workers and members of the collective farms at will, embezzle and steal, speculate, seek profit, and squander recklessly. The state farms and collective farms they control have actually become their private property. Their relationship with the workers of the state farms and the members of the collective farms has become one of oppression and being oppressed, exploitation and being exploited.

The broad masses of the Soviet people are resisting and opposing this big retreat to capitalism. They want to take the socialist road. One day, the Soviet people will settle accounts with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique.

The Soviet revisionists are hurriedly restoring capitalism in agriculture. The so-called collective farms and state farms have degenerated and changed.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is restoring capitalism throughout the Soviet Union. From the scattered materials revealed in Soviet publications, it is possible to get a rough idea of how Soviet agriculture is degenerating into capitalism.

	Vigorously Promoting Land Allocation to Groups

According to a report in the Soviet newspaper *Pravda*, the workers of the "Golden Fields" state farm in Okoneshnikov District, Omsk Oblast, conducted an experiment with land allocation to groups. The group participating in the experiment consisted of six people, and they were allocated 700 hectares of arable land, two tractors, three combine harvesters, and the necessary accessories. The newspaper hailed this big retreat in agriculture as "creative exploration in the countryside."

This kind of experiment with land allocation to groups is being conducted in some state farms and collective farms in the Soviet Union. The *Komsomolskaya Pravda* even published an article advocating the permanent allocation of land to individuals. This newspaper published an article by Bobrakov, the chairman of the "Red Ukraine" collective farm in Sumy Oblast, which said: "Allocate land permanently to an individual, give him the technical equipment and economic accounting rights, and make his happiness depend on the final products obtained from this piece of land. In this way, the public becomes one's own, and one's own becomes public, and labor will become meaningful and pleasant." The article shouted: "The direction has been determined, advance more firmly and vigorously in this direction."

An article published in the Soviet newspaper *Selskaya Zhizn* on January 25 of this year openly advocated changing the collective ownership of collective farms to group ownership and absurdly claimed that "the collective farm group ownership is socialist ownership, that is, in terms of its socio-economic essence, it is unified with state ownership."

	Implementing the Principle of Profit as the Core

The Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev announced at the March Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee in 1965: "The level of profit should be the objective basis for evaluating the operational activities of collective farms and state farms."

According to a recent report by TASS, the Soviet revisionist leadership has decided to expand the "new system," which takes profit as the core, to agriculture, and will first implement it in 390 state farms.

	Vigorously Developing Private Economy

The Soviet revisionist leadership vigorously encourages the development of the private economy. At the end of 1964 and the beginning of 1965, it abolished the restrictions on the number of livestock that members of collective farms, workers, and employees could keep, and provided loans and feed for the development of private sideline production.

According to a report in the Soviet magazine *Agrarnaya Ekonomika* in its 10th issue of 1965, based on materials from the Soviet Central Statistical Bureau, among the members of collective farms of working age, about two-thirds of their labor is spent on private plots. In the Caucasus, Central Asia, some republics, and Moldova, the vast majority of the labor force in the countryside is engaged in household work and cultivating private plots. In the Baltic republics, the highest proportion is in Lithuania, and in the Russian Federation, it is in the Central Black Earth Region.

	Ruthlessly Exploiting Workers and Members of Collective Farms

In state farms and collective farms, workers and members of collective farms are ruthlessly exploited. According to reports, the director of the "Aurora" state farm in the Moldavian SSR "recruits minors to engage in heavy physical labor" and "does not pay them wages according to the law." Most collective farms have a large number of administrative and service personnel. On average, nationwide, 4 to 25 administrative personnel are supported by every 100 members of collective farms. In the "Bolshevik" collective farm in Minsk Oblast, there is one administrative personnel for every four members of the collective farm. In the Gulyayev collective farm in this oblast, administrative personnel account for 12.6% of the able-bodied members of the collective farm and consume 42.8% of the total labor remuneration fund. In the "Baku Worker" collective farm in the Azerbaijan SSR, in 1965, the chairman of the collective farm received an average monthly salary of 1,076 rubles, while the members of the collective farm received an average of only 38 rubles per month.

### 苏修在农业中加紧复辟资本主义  所谓集体农庄和国营农场已蜕化变质

专栏：

    编者按：苏修领导集团正加紧在农业方面复辟资本主义。
    他们在国营农场和集体农庄中，推广“分地到组”的试验，大力发展私有经济。
    他们正在把以资本主义利润原则为核心的、彻底复辟资本主义的“新体制”，推行到农业中去。
    原来是全民所有制的国营农场和集体所有制的集体农庄，现在已经面目全非了。在那里，资本主义势力大肆泛滥，新的富农经济日益发展。所谓集体农庄和国营农场，已经逐步蜕变为资本主义的农庄和企业。
    在今天的苏联农村，出现了形形色色的新的资产阶级分子。许多农场和农庄的领导人和他们的一伙，为所欲为地剥削工人和庄员，贪污盗窃，投机倒把，唯利是图，肆意挥霍。这伙人所把持的国营农场和集体农庄，实际上变成了他们的私产。他们同农场工人和农庄庄员的关系，已变成压迫与被压迫、剥削与被剥削的关系。
    苏联广大劳动人民是抵制和反对这种向资本主义大倒退的，他们要走社会主义的道路。总有一天，苏联人民会起来向苏修统治集团算总帐的。
    苏修在农业中加紧复辟资本主义
    所谓集体农庄和国营农场已蜕化变质
    苏联修正主义统治集团正在苏联全面复辟资本主义。从苏联报刊透露出来的点滴材料中，大体可以看出，苏联农业是怎样在向资本主义蜕化的。
                 大力鼓吹分地到组
    据苏联《真理报》报道，鄂木斯克州奥科涅什尼科夫区“金色田地”国营农场的工作人员进行了分地到组的试验。参加小组的有六个人，拨给这个小组七百公顷耕地、两台拖拉机、三台联合收割机以及必要的附属机件。报纸把这种农业上的大倒退吹嘘为“农村中的创造性的探索”。
    这种分地到组的试验在苏联一些国营农场和集体农庄进行。苏联《共青团真理报》甚至载文鼓吹把土地固定给个人。这家报纸刊登苏密州“红色乌克兰”集体农庄主席鲍勃拉科夫写的文章说：“把土地固定给一个人，把技术设备和经济核算权交到他的手中，使他的幸福取决于最终从这块土地上获得的产品，这样，公共的就成为自己的，而自己的也成为公共的，劳动就将成为有意义的、愉快的事情。”文章叫嚷：“方向已经确定了，朝着这个方向更加坚定地、更加奋发地一直前进吧。”
    苏联《农村生活报》今年一月二十五日发表的一篇文章中公然把农庄集体所有制改为小组所有制，并胡说什么“集体农庄小组所有制是社会主义的所有制，即就其社会经济实质来说同国家所有制是统一的。”
                推行利润挂帅原则
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫在一九六五年的苏共中央三月全会上宣布：“赢利水平应当成为客观上评价集体农庄和国营农场经营活动的基础。”
    据塔斯社最近报道，苏修领导集团已决定把以利润挂帅为核心的“新体制”扩大到农业，首先将在三百九十个国营农场推行。
                大力发展私有经济
    苏修领导集团大力鼓励发展私有经济，一九六四年末、一九六五年初，取消了对庄员、工人和职员留用宅旁园地和私养牲畜头数的限制，并为发展私人副业发放贷款、提供饲料。
    据苏联《农业经济》杂志一九六五年第十期报道，根据苏联中央统计局的材料，集体农庄中适合劳动年龄的庄员中有总数三分之二左右的劳动耗费在宅旁园地上。在外高加索、中亚细亚的一些共和国和摩尔达维亚，农村里的极大部分劳动力在从事家务劳动和耕作宅旁园地。在波罗的海沿岸的共和国里，这个比例最大的是立陶宛，在俄罗斯联邦里则是中央黑土地带。
                残酷剥削工人庄员
    在国营农场和集体农庄，工人和庄员们遭受残酷剥削。据报道，摩尔达维亚共和国“曙光”国营农场场长“吸收少年参加繁重的体力劳动”，“不按法律付给他们劳动报酬”。大多数的集体农庄还有庞大的行政管理服务人员，全国平均每一百名庄员要养活四到二十五个管理人员。在明斯克州的“布尔什维克”集体农庄里，每四名庄员就有一名管理人员。在这个州的古利亚耶夫集体农庄里，管理人员占有劳动能力庄员人数的百分之十二点六，耗费全部劳动报酬基金的百分之四十二点八。在阿塞拜疆共和国“巴库工人”集体农庄，一九六五年，集体农庄主席平均每月工资高达一千零七十六卢布，而庄员平均每月只有三十八卢布。
