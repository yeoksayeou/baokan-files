Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"

The General Political Department Calls for the Entire Army to Study and Promote the "Speech"

Chairman Mao's brilliant work has provided the most comprehensive, profound, and systematic scientific summary of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two worldviews on the cultural front. It is a programmatic document for the proletarian cultural revolution. All military cadres and soldiers should hold high the revolutionary critical banner of Mao Zedong Thought, severely criticize "Cultivation of the Self," smash the black line in literature and art, thoroughly criticize and expose the chief culprit behind the revisionist black line in literature and art, and push the great criticism movement to a new high.

The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army on the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"

This May marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." This work, which creatively develops the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, is a landmark document. It provides the most comprehensive, profound, and systematic scientific summary of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two worldviews on the cultural front. It is a programmatic document for the proletarian cultural revolution, the first complete, thorough, and correct Marxist-Leninist literary line in the history of proletarian revolution, and a powerful weapon for defeating modern revisionism and various bourgeois ideas. Currently, China's proletarian cultural revolution has achieved great victories that have shaken the world. The revolutionary masses are launching a great criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. At this historic moment, we, with hearts full of excitement, join the revolutionary masses across the country to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and enthusiastically celebrate the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line! We must hold high the revolutionary critical banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the boundless and invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, severely criticize "Cultivation of the Self," smash the black line in literature and art, thoroughly criticize and expose the chief culprit behind the revisionist black line in literature and art, and push the great criticism movement against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road to a new high. We must thoroughly eliminate the influence of "Cultivation of the Self" and the black line in literature and art within the military, promote the thought revolution in the troops, and better complete tasks such as supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military management, military training, as well as preparedness and production. We will fight to defend and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and resolutely carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end!

To this end, we must closely link the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" with the education on the struggle between the two lines, and with the study of the Central Committee's "Notice," making it the center of the current propaganda and cultural work in the troops.

(1) Each unit should, in conjunction with the current proletarian cultural revolution, organize cadres and soldiers to seriously study the "Notice," Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and other important works and instructions on culture and art. They should also study Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on military art work, the minutes of the military art work symposium convened by Comrade Jiang Qing on behalf of Comrade Lin Biao, as well as relevant editorials and important articles in newspapers and magazines. Each level of the Party committee and political organs must seriously organize and lead this study. Each level of leadership cadres must take the lead in studying well and must pay more attention to class struggle in the ideological realm, further strengthening the leadership of cultural and artistic work.

(2) Each unit may hold a commemoration meeting or symposium for the 25th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"; organize revolutionary literary and art workers, cadres, and soldiers to write articles sharing their experiences and insights from studying the "Speech," vigorously promoting the great significance of the "Speech," promoting the brilliant achievements of proletarian revolutionary literature and art, and promoting Comrade Jiang Qing's great contributions to defending and implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line and the proletarian cultural revolution. Thoroughly criticize the poisonous weeds and various revisionist literary thoughts named in newspapers and magazines. Military newspapers and magazines should promptly publish relevant commemorative editorials and articles.

(3) Each unit should, under the guidance of the principle of seizing revolution and promoting preparedness, work, and production, organize professional art troupes and amateur performance teams to perform excellent revolutionary and combat-oriented literary and art programs in the troops, factories, rural areas, and schools.

    新华社二十日讯　人民解放军总政治部关于纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的指示
    今年五月，是我们伟大领袖毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。毛主席这一光辉著作，天才地创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，是一部划时代的重要文献。这部著作，对文化战线上两个阶级、两条路线、两种世界观的斗争，作了最全面、最深刻、最系统的科学的总结，是无产阶级文化革命的纲领性文件，是无产阶级革命历史上第一次提出的最完整、最彻底、最正确的马克思列宁主义文艺路线，是战胜现代修正主义和形形色色的资产阶级思想最有力的武器。当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得震撼世界的伟大胜利，无产阶级革命派正在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开大批判，实行总攻击。在这具有伟大历史意义的时刻，我们以万分激动的心情，和全国革命群众一起，纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，热烈欢呼毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利！我们要高高举起毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，以光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批《修养》，大破文艺黑线，彻底批倒批臭修正主义文艺黑线的总后台，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动，推向一个新高潮。彻底肃清《修养》和文艺黑线在军内的影响，促进部队思想革命化，更好地完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训以及战备、生产等任务，为捍卫和执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！

    （二）各单位可召开毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年的纪念会，座谈会；组织革命文艺工作者和干部、战士撰写学习《讲话》的心得体会等文章，大力宣传《讲话》的伟大意义，宣传无产阶级革命文艺的光辉成就，宣传江青同志坚决捍卫和执行毛主席的革命文艺路线和对无产阶级文化大革命的重大贡献。彻底批判在报刊上点名的毒草作品和种种修正主义的文艺思想。军内报刊，应及时刊登有关纪念《讲话》的社论和文章。
    （三）各单位在开展纪念活动中，应在抓革命，促战备、促工作、促生产的方针指导下，组织专业文艺团体和业余演出队，到部队、工厂、农村、学校演出革命化、战斗化的优秀文艺节目。
