At a crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering the stage of launching a great criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the great notice issued by our great leader Chairman Mao on May 16, 1966, and personally drafted by him, has been published! This is a major event in our country's political life and a major event in the international communist movement.

Lenin once said on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the October Revolution: "The farther this great day is from us, the more clearly we see the significance of the Russian proletarian revolution, and the deeper we understand all the actual experience of our work." The same is true for our understanding of great revolutionary practice, and the same is true for our understanding of great revolutionary theory. Through a year of heart-rending class struggle, we have seen more clearly the profound significance of this great historical document, the "May 16 Notification," and have further understood the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We have come to recognize more deeply the greatness and foresight of Chairman Mao, his genius and wisdom.

In this great historical document, Chairman Mao points out:

"Those in the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles who are in fact representatives of the bourgeoisie and are in fact a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists, will, when conditions are ripe, seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them have already been exposed, some have not yet been exposed, and some are being trusted by us and are being cultivated as our successors, such as the Khrushchov type, who are now sleeping by our side. All levels of Party committees must pay full attention to this point."

Here, Chairman Mao teaches us that the handful of power-holders within the Party and the state who are taking the capitalist road, those Khrushchov-type figures sleeping by our side, are our most dangerous enemies.

Why are they said to be our most dangerous enemies? Because, under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, they are the main representatives of the reactionary classes in their attempt to restore capitalism.

These power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have usurped the leading positions in the Party and the state and have power in their hands. "Once power is in hand, orders can be issued." Because they have power, they can block, distort, and even openly oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, principles, and policies, and promote their reactionary line and policies that oppose socialism and restore capitalism. Because they have power, they can win over traitors, form cliques, place their own people in key positions, strike at the left, and protect the right. Because they have power, they can use the organizations and propaganda tools they control to spread their poison and create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. They are enemies who have infiltrated our fortress and time bombs buried in our proletarian headquarters.

The power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are deceitful, having a great deal of deceitfulness. They try to promote themselves, praise each other, cheat, and disguise themselves as "Marxist-Leninists." They are hypocritical, appearing as friends in front but as ghosts behind. Before their two-faced tactics are exposed, some of the masses are easily deceived.

The handful of big and small power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by the Chinese Khrushchov, are such a dangerous bunch of people.

The Chinese Khrushchov is the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, an old opportunist. For a long time, he has promoted an opportunist line, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. During the democratic revolutionary period, he abandoned the leadership of the proletariat, advocated the "parliamentary road," opposed the "gun," and opposed armed seizure of power. During the socialist revolutionary period, he advocated the theory of "exploitation is meritorious," promoting the development of capitalism in cities and countryside; he advocated the theory of "class struggle extinction," opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat; he attacked the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, advocating "three freedoms and one contract." He used the Party and state leadership power he usurped to propose and promote a whole set of theories and policies for the restoration of capitalism. Such a Kautsky, Bukharin, Khrushchov-type figure, however, disguised himself as "China's Marx" and "the authority on party-building theory." If such a person is allowed to continue sleeping by our side, it would be too dangerous!

The head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Committee, Peng Zhen, is the vanguard of the Chinese Khrushchov in restoring capitalism. For a long time, he has carefully cultivated himself, disguising himself as an "outstanding activist" of our Party, even trying to appear as a "theorist." In fact, he is an uneducated, uninformed, non-communicating, ignorant, and dictatorial bigwig who relies on his authority. This person is good at political profiteering, playing tricks, and manipulating power, with long arms and sharp heads, bullying superiors and oppressing inferiors. He infiltrated the Central Committee, controlled Beijing, and turned the old Beijing Municipal Committee into their independent kingdom, attempting to use Beijing as a base for restoring capitalism.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Lu Dingyi, who has long held the reins of power in the ideological field, madly attacks Mao Zedong Thought and, using the cultural and propaganda power he has usurped, blocks the publication of Chairman Mao's works, opposes the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and slanders the great mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "pragmatism." For many years, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchov, he has used newspapers, radio, books, speeches, and various literary and artistic works to spread a large number of anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weeds, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism.

For more than a decade since the founding of the country, the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by the Chinese Khrushchov, have, at every historical juncture, stirred up evil winds and waves, set up numerous hidden reefs, attempting to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and make the socialist ship capsize in the backwash of the restoration of capitalism. It can be said that with every step we advance, we have to engage in fierce struggles with them. If we lose vigilance and do not engage in struggle with them, then our dictatorship of the proletariat will certainly become the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, our Party will certainly become a fascist party, and there will certainly be a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration, the whole of China will change color, and human history will take a big step backward.

The bourgeoisie seizes power through the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the fundamental characteristic of the bourgeoisie's restoration activities under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Everyone knows that after the victory of the October Revolution, the armed attacks launched by the fourteen imperialist countries led by the United States and Britain, the armed rebellions of the White Guards led by Denikin and Kolchak, and the large-scale military invasions by Hitler, did not overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union, and they were all defeated by the heroic Soviet people. However, the domestic and foreign bourgeoisie, through the handful of power-holders within the Soviet Party who are taking the capitalist road, such as Khrushchov, turned the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviet Union into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and carried out the restoration of capitalism. This extraordinary historical lesson, we must never forget, never forget.

Chairman Mao summarized the experience of class struggle in the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat in our country and the historical lessons of the dictatorship of the proletariat internationally, and proposed the great theory that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the main target of the revolutionary struggle is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is a epoch-making development of Marxism-Leninism, the theoretical basis for thoroughly carrying out the socialist revolution, and the compass for advancing towards the victory of communism.

In January 1965, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out in the "Twenty-three Articles" that the focus of the socialist education movement is "to rectify those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

In August 1966, the "Sixteen Articles" drafted under the personal direction of Chairman Mao again emphasized that the focus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is "to rectify those power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road."

The contradiction between the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the principal contradiction, an antagonistic contradiction. The struggle to resolve this contradiction is the concentrated expression of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the struggle between socialism and capitalism.

Concentrating our forces to strike at the handful of most principal and dangerous enemies is a basic strategic thought of Marxism-Leninism. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the reactionary bourgeoisie, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements within the Party, the protectors of all ghosts and monsters. They are the political representatives of the forces of capitalist restoration. Only by overthrowing them can we effectively prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Concentrating our forces to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the grand direction of the revolutionary struggle under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the grand direction of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must firmly grasp this grand direction. Otherwise, we will make a big mistake.

Now, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, although they have already suffered heavy blows, are not reconciled to their failure. They will definitely do everything they can to sabotage and create trouble, and will seize any opportunity to launch a counterattack. We must not be deceived by their "pitiable appearance" and must not show any mercy to them. "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength than to seek fame by imitating King Xiang Yu." We must pursue them relentlessly! We must carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    把斗争矛头指向最危险的敌人
    战犹酣
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展大批判的关键时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，公开发表了！这是我国政治生活中的重大事件，也是国际共产主义运动中的重大事件。
    列宁在纪念十月革命四周年时说过：“这个伟大的日子离开我们愈远，俄国无产阶级革命的意义就愈明显，我们对整个实际的工作经验也就了解得愈深刻。”对伟大革命实践的理解是这样，对伟大革命理论的理解也是这样。通过一年来惊心动魄的阶级斗争，我们更加看清了《通知》这个伟大历史文件的深远意义，进一步理解了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践，越来越深刻地认识到毛主席的英明伟大，高瞻远瞩，他的天才和智慧。
    毛主席在这个伟大的历史文件中指出：
    “混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。这些人物，有些已被我们识破了，有些则还没有被识破，有些正在受到我们信用，被培养为我们的接班人，例如赫鲁晓夫那样的人物，他们现正睡在我们的身旁，各级党委必须充分注意这一点。”
    在这里，毛主席教导我们，一小撮混进党和国家领导机关中的走资本主义道路当权派，那些睡在我们身旁的赫鲁晓夫式的人物，是我们最危险的敌人。
    为什么说，他们是我们的最危险的敌人呢？这是因为，在无产阶级专政的条件下，他们是反动阶级搞资本主义复辟的主要代表。
    这些党内走资本主义道路的当权派，窃踞了党和国家的领导岗位，手里有权。“一朝权在手，便把令来行。”因为有权，他们可以封锁、篡改以至公开对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、方针和政策，推行他们那一套反对社会主义、复辟资本主义的反动路线和政策。因为有权，他们可以招降纳叛，结党营私，安插党羽，窃踞要津，打击左派，包庇右派。因为有权，他们可以通过他们所掌握的一些组织机构，利用他们所把持的一些宣传工具，大放其毒，为资本主义复辟制造舆论。他们是潜入我们堡垒内部的敌人，埋在我们无产阶级司令部里的定时炸弹。
    党内走资本主义道路的当权派，因为是打着红旗反红旗，有很大的欺骗性。他们竭力自我标榜，互相吹嘘，招摇撞骗，把自己打扮成“马克思列宁主义者”的样子。他们阴一套，阳一套，当面是人，背后是鬼，在他们的两面派手法没有被揭穿以前，有些群众是很容易上当的。
    以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派，就是这样一批最危险的人物。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，是个老机会主义分子。长期以来，他推行一条机会主义路线，同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗。在民主革命时期，他放弃无产阶级领导权，鼓吹
  “议会道路”，不要“枪杆子”，反对武装夺取政权。在社会主义革命时期，他宣扬“剥削有功”论，鼓吹在城乡发展资本主义；宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，反对无产阶级专政；攻击总路线、大跃进、人民公社，鼓吹“三自一包”。他利用窃取的党和国家的领导权，提出并且推行了一整套复辟资本主义的理论和政策。就是这样一个考茨基、布哈林、赫鲁晓夫式的人物，却把自己打扮成“中国的马克思”，“建党的理论权威”。如果让此人继续睡在我们身边，那简直太危险了！
    旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的头子彭真，是中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的急先锋。长期以来，他苦心经营，把自己装扮成为我们党的“优秀的活动家”，甚至竭力装出“理论家”的样子。实际上，他是一个不读书、不看报、不接触群众、什么学问也没有、专靠武断和以势压人的大党阀。此人最善于捞政治资本，耍阴谋，弄权术，手长头尖，欺上压下。他钻进中央，控制北京市，把旧北京市委搞成他们称王称霸的独立王国，妄图把北京作为复辟资本主义的基地。
    长期把持意识形态领域大权的反革命修正主义分子陆定一，疯狂地攻击毛泽东思想，并且利用他所窃取的文化、宣传大权，抵制出版毛主席著作，反对传播毛泽东思想，把活学活用毛主席著作的伟大群众运动，污蔑为“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“实用主义”。多年来，他在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，利用报刊、广播、书籍、演讲和各种文学艺术，抛出大批的反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的毒草，为资本主义复辟大造舆论。
    建国十多年来，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内走资本主义道路当权派，在每一个历史关头，都兴妖风，掀恶浪，设置重重暗礁，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，妄图使社会主义的航船，覆没在资本主义复辟的逆流中。可以说，我们每前进一步，都要同他们进行激烈的斗争。如果我们丧失警惕，不同他们进行针锋相对的斗争，那末，我们的无产阶级专政就一定会变成资产阶级专政，我们的党就一定会变成法西斯的党，就一定会出现全国性的反革命复辟，整个中国就要改变颜色，人类历史就要大倒退。
    资产阶级通过党内走资本主义道路当权派来夺取政权，这是在无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级搞复辟活动的根本特点。
    大家知道，十月革命胜利之后，美、英等十四个帝国主义国家联合发动的武装进攻，邓尼金、高尔察克等白匪的武装叛乱，以及希特勒的大规模军事侵略，都没有搞垮苏联的无产阶级专政，他们都被英勇的苏联人民打败了。但是，国内外的资产阶级，通过赫鲁晓夫等一小撮苏联党内走资本主义道路当权派，却把苏联无产阶级专政变成了资产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。这个非同寻常的历史教训，我们永远不能忘记，永远不能忘记。
    毛主席总结了我国无产阶级专政时期阶级斗争的经验，总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史教训，提出了在无产阶级专政下，革命斗争的主要对象是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的伟大理论。这是对马克思列宁主义的划时代发展，是彻底进行社会主义革命的理论基础，是向着共产主义胜利前进的指南针。
    一九六五年一月，毛主席在《二十三条》中明确提出：社会主义教育运动的重点，“是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。
    一九六六年八月，毛主席亲自主持制定的《十六条》又一次强调指出：无产阶级文化大革命运动的重点，“是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”。
    广大工农兵、革命干部、革命知识分子同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是主要矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾。解决这个矛盾的斗争，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争，社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争的集中表现。
    把自己的力量集中起来，打击一小撮最主要最危险的敌人，这是马克思列宁主义的一个基本策略思想。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是反动的资产阶级，地、富、反、坏在党内的代理人，是一切牛鬼蛇神的保护伞。他们是资本主义复辟势力的政治代表。只有打倒他们，才能有效地防止资本主义复辟。
    集中力量打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，这是无产阶级专政条件下革命斗争的大方向，是无产阶级文化大革命的大方向。我们必须牢牢掌握这个大方向。否则，就要犯绝大的错误。
    现在，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，虽然已经遭到了沉重的打击，但是他们不甘心自己的失败。他们一定要千方百计地进行破坏捣乱，一有时机就会搞反攻倒算。我们决不能被他们的“可怜相”所迷惑，决不能对他们发什么慈悲。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”我们一定要穷追猛打！我们一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
