In the midst of the great upsurge of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, at this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two lines, watching the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Sha Jiahui," I felt even more excited and my understanding deepened.

The excellence of this opera lies in its vivid and vivid portrayal of the great military thought of Mao Zedong.

In the Beijing opera "Sha Jiahui," all struggles are subordinate to armed struggle. The enemy fears nothing more than the brave New Fourth Army. They use every means to interrogate Ah Qing, torture Grandma Sha, and force the common people to divulge information, all in an attempt to find out the whereabouts of the New Fourth Army. The people of Sha Jiahui, on the other hand, regard their own soldiers as their lifeline. They deeply understand that as long as they have their own armed forces and preserve the New Fourth Army in the reeds, no matter how arrogant the enemy is, the final victory will surely be ours. This is indeed the case. The New Fourth Army, after holding out for a period in the reed marshes, with the strong support of the people of Sha Jiahui, bravely launched an attack and annihilated the Kuomintang and Japanese bandits in one fell swoop. Sha Jiahui once again returned to the hands of the people.

After the New Fourth Army arrived in Sha Jiahui, they treated the people of Sha Jiahui as their class brothers. They inquired about their well-being, helped with chores, and conducted political education among the common people. The people of Sha Jiahui, in turn, risked their lives to protect the wounded and sick, deliver intelligence, and provide food. The army loved the people, and the people supported the army. The army and the people united as one. Therefore, when the enemy entered Sha Jiahui, they were like blind and deaf men, becoming sitting ducks, unable to move a step, and getting beaten everywhere. Our New Fourth Army, on the other hand, had clear eyes and a keen mind, knowing every move of the enemy. This fully proves that the blood bond and close unity between the army and the people is "a true iron wall that no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries."

In nearly a year of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we have deeply felt that the revolutionary masses must have the People's Liberation Army as their strong backing to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road and to achieve revolutionary great unity and the "three-in-one combination." The power struggle in our Heilongjiang Province best illustrates this point. Last winter, a handful of power-holders within the old provincial committee who were taking the capitalist road were very rampant. They carried out white terror and attempted to suppress the revolutionary masses. At this critical moment, the People's Liberation Army of China took action. They actively supported the Red Rebels, suppressed counter-revolutionary organizations, and the situation immediately turned around. The revolutionary masses grew rapidly in the struggle and finally seized power from the handful of power-holders within the old provincial committee who were taking the capitalist road, establishing a revolutionary "three-in-one combination" provisional power organ.

At present, the struggle between the two lines is in the decisive stage. All class enemies fear the unity of the army and the people the most. They spread rumors and slander in an attempt to sow discord between the army and the people, and direct their attacks at our great People's Liberation Army. We revolutionary masses of the proletariat must see through this plot and unite closely with the Liberation Army!

    阶级爱鱼水情
    黑龙江省革命委员会委员　杨锡山
    在无产阶级文化大革命高潮中，在两条路线进行决战的关键时刻，看了革命现代京剧《沙家浜》，心情更为激动，体会更加深刻。
    这出戏好就好在它生动地、形象地反映了伟大的毛泽东军事思想。
    在京剧《沙家浜》中，一切斗争都是服从武装斗争的。敌人最害怕的就是英勇的新四军，他们千方百计询问阿庆嫂，拷打沙奶奶，逼供老百姓，都是想知道新四军的去向；而沙家浜的人民呢，更是把自己的子弟兵当作命根子。他们深深懂得：只要有了自己的武装，保存了芦苇丛中的新四军，那么，不管敌人怎样嚣张，最后胜利一定属于我们。事实正是这样，我新四军在芦苇荡里坚持一段时间之后，在沙家浜人民群众的大力支持下，勇敢出击，一举消灭了国民党和日本匪军，沙家浜又重新回到了人民的手里。
    新四军来到沙家浜之后，他们把沙家浜的人民当作自己的阶级兄弟，问暖问寒，帮助挑水扫地，向老百姓作政治教育工作。而沙家浜的人民则冒着生命危险，掩护伤病员，送情报，送粮食……。军爱民，民拥军，军民团结一条心。因此，敌人走进沙家浜就象瞎子、聋子，一下成了瓮中之鳖，寸步难行，处处挨打。而我们的新四军则眼明心亮，对敌人一举一动，了如指掌。这充分证明了军队与人民群众的血肉联系、紧密团结是“真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”
    在将近一年的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我们深深感到：无产阶级革命派要夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，实现革命的大联合，革命的“三结合”，必须要有人民解放军作为自己的坚强后盾。我们黑龙江省的夺权斗争最能说明这个问题。去年冬天，旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派非常猖獗，他们大搞白色恐怖，企图把无产阶级革命派压下去。正在这个关键时刻，中国人民解放军出动了，他们积极支持红色造反者，镇压反革命组织，于是局势马上扭转，革命派在斗争中迅速成长壮大，最后，夺了旧省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，建立了革命的“三结合”临时权力机构。
    当前，两条路线斗争正处在大决战阶段。一切阶级敌人最害怕军民团结，他们造谣诬蔑，企图挑拨军民关系，并把矛头指向我们伟大的人民解放军。我们无产阶级革命派一定要识破这个阴谋，紧密地与解放军团结在一起！
