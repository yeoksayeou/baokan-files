The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution aims to revolutionize people's thinking, thereby enabling all work to be done better, faster, more efficiently, and more economically. As long as the masses are fully mobilized and arrangements are properly made, it is possible to ensure that the cultural revolution and production do not interfere with each other and that all work is of high quality. Excerpted from the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution"

Strive to Ensure a Good Summer Harvest

The summer harvest season is approaching in the vast rural areas of our country, and some places have already begun to harvest. This year, summer crops have generally grown well. It can be predicted that this year's summer grain crops will be a bumper harvest. This is a great victory for the broad masses of commune members and revolutionary cadres in the countryside in implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." It is another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Ensuring a good summer harvest this year has extremely important political significance. It not only affects the bumper harvest of agriculture this year and the lives of the people across the country, but also affects the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The bumper harvest of summer grain nationwide will once again demonstrate to the world how the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and how great a material force great Mao Zedong Thought can become. This will certainly boost the morale of the revolutionary people of the world and strike a blow to the arrogance of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

The current task of the revolutionary masses in the countryside is to further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," using the great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road as a driving force, to devote all efforts to ensure a good summer harvest and achieve both high yield and high harvest.

Poor and lower-middle peasants are the main force in the countryside for grasping revolution and promoting production. You must play a leading role in the great struggle and criticism. You must, with a high sense of political responsibility and the most resolute actions, throw yourselves into the summer harvest work.

Revolutionary cadres at all levels in the countryside must firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and on the side of the poor and lower-middle peasants, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, mobilize the masses, and immediately launch a summer harvest production high tide.

The People's Liberation Army, in response to Chairman Mao's great call, has gone to the front line of agricultural production, grasped revolution, promoted production, and made tremendous contributions. We hope that you will continue to make greater achievements by actively participating in and safeguarding the summer harvest.

Revolutionary workers, you are the most outstanding models of the working people across the country in grasping revolution and promoting production. We hope that you will continue to work with great enthusiasm, strive for the best, and with a fighting attitude, do a good job of supporting the summer harvest quickly and well.

Revolutionary teachers and students should follow Chairman Mao's great instructions that intellectuals should combine with the workers and peasants, go to the countryside, learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and work together with them to ensure a good summer harvest. Schools that are conducting military and political training should go to the countryside during the summer harvest period to help farmers with the harvest while conducting military and political training.

Revolutionary comrades in party and government organs, industrial, commercial, and financial departments, and other fronts should take a keen interest in the summer harvest work with the greatest political enthusiasm and do your best to support the summer harvest.

Ensuring a good summer harvest is a sharp class struggle. At present, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are making trouble again at the peak of the summer harvest, attempting to sabotage production and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They use the spread of rumors and the allocation of high work points to deceive and incite some farmers who do not understand the truth to go to the city, participate in armed struggles, and attack revolutionary leftists. Poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres must heighten their revolutionary vigilance and resolutely smash the sabotage plots of the class enemies. Those who incite and instigate farmers to leave their production posts and go to the city to participate in armed struggles must be punished according to law.

Revolutionary masses, teachers and students, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres who go to the countryside to participate in the summer harvest should humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, exchange revolutionary experiences; at the same time, they should propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to them, and together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and through production and study, further promote their own ideological revolutionization.

Poor and lower-middle peasants, all working people, and revolutionary cadres, take immediate action, further implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," concentrate your efforts to win this battle of the summer harvest, and lay a good foundation for the bumper harvest of agriculture throughout the year.

    无产阶级文化大革命，就是为的要使人的思想革命化，因而使各项工作做得更多、更快、更好、更省。只要充分发动群众，妥善安排，就能够保证文化革命和生产两不误，保证各项工作的高质量。摘自《中国共产党中央委员会关于无产阶级文化大革命的决定》
    大力抓紧夏收
    我国广大农村夏收大忙季节就要到来，有些地方已开镰收割。今年，各地的夏收作物普遍生长良好。可以预计，今年的夏粮作物将是一个大丰收。这是广大社员和农村革命干部执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    搞好今年的夏收，有着极其重大的政治意义。它不仅关系到今年农业的丰收，关系到全国人民的生活，而且关系到无产阶级文化大革命。
    全国夏粮的大丰收，将再一次向全世界显示：无产阶级文化大革命是怎样激发了我国广大人民群众的革命干劲，伟大的毛泽东思想能够转化成为多么伟大的物质力量。这必将大长全世界革命人民的志气，大灭帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风。
    当前农村无产阶级革命派的任务是，进一步贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，以对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争为动力，全力以赴，搞好夏收工作，坚决做到丰产丰收。
    贫下中农是农村中抓革命、促生产的主力军。你们一定要在大批判、大斗争中发挥骨干带头作用。你们一定要以高度的政治责任心，以最坚决的行动，投入夏收工作。
    农村各级革命干部要坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，站在贫下中农一边，深入群众，深入实际，放手发动群众，立即掀起一个夏收生产高潮。
    人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，开赴农业生产第一线，抓革命，促生产，做出了巨大的贡献。希望你们再接再厉，积极参加夏收，保卫夏收，做出更大的成绩。
    革命的职工同志们，你们是全国劳动群众抓革命、促生产的最出色的模范。希望你们继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，以战斗的姿态，又快又好地做好支援夏收的工作。
    学校的革命师生，要遵照毛主席关于知识分子要和工农群众相结合的伟大指示，到农村去，向贫下中农学习，和他们一起搞好夏收。正在开展军政训练的学校，在夏收期间，应该到农村去一边帮助农民夏收，一边进行军政训练。
    各地党政机关、工交财贸部门和其他各个战线的无产阶级革命派的同志们，你们要以最大的政治热情关心夏收工作，为支援夏收尽自己最大的力量。
    搞好夏收是一场尖锐的阶级斗争。目前，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在夏收大忙时刻，又在兴风作浪，妄图破坏生产，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们用制造谣言和记高额工分的办法，欺骗、挑动一些不明真相的农民进城，参加武斗，围攻革命左派。贫下中农和革命干部一定要提高革命警惕，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋。对于一小撮挑唆和煽动农民离开生产岗位，进城参加武斗的首恶分子，必须依法惩处。
    到农村参加夏收的革命群众，革命师生，解放军指战员，革命干部，应当虚心向贫下中农学习，交流革命经验；同时要向他们宣传毛泽东思想和党的方针政策，同贫下中农一起活学活用毛主席著作，通过生产和学习，进一步促进自己的思想革命化。
    贫下中农、一切劳动群众和革命干部，紧急行动起来，进一步贯彻毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，集中力量打好夏收这一仗，为全年的农业丰收打下良好基础。
