The publication of the important article by the editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*, "The Essence of 'In Cultivation' is Betraying the Proletarian Dictatorship," has provided revolutionary cadres and Red Guards across the country with new ideological weapons and added boundless fighting strength to the ongoing revolutionary criticism. In recent days, revolutionary cadres from numerous factories, rural areas, offices, and schools across the country have held discussion meetings and study sessions to learn from this important article. Revolutionary cadres from various regions have expressed their determination to hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to seize the crucial issue of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and his poisonous weed "In Cultivation" opposing the proletarian dictatorship, to pursue and attack relentlessly, to thoroughly criticize and expose this old revisionist and his "In Cultivation," to completely eliminate his poison in various fields, and to resolutely defend our great proletarian dictatorship.

Revolutionary cadres from various regions pointed out that the article by the editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily* has accurately pointed out that the essence of "In Cultivation" is betraying the proletarian dictatorship. This issue is well-raised and correct, indeed hitting the nail on the head of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, and expressing the thoughts of revolutionary people. Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating power." Without the proletarian dictatorship, there would be nothing for the laboring people. However, the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and his poisonous weed "In Cultivation" try every means to make people forget about the proletarian dictatorship, aiming to establish bourgeois dictatorship and restore capitalism. Revolutionary cadres from various regions have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to never forget class struggle and the proletarian dictatorship, to closely combine the current revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their own regions and units, to achieve a complete victory in the struggle for power by the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and to defend the ironclad mountains and rivers of the proletariat forever.

Revolutionary cadres and Red Guards from various regions pointed out: The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party wants people to detach themselves from the fiery class struggle to engage in "self-cultivation," attempting to make us detach from politics, detach from revolution, not care about state affairs, and forget about the proletarian power. The result of such "cultivation" can only "cultivate" big and small Khrushchevs and can only "cultivate" away our socialist mountains and rivers. We revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must oppose him head-on and do the opposite. We must actively throw ourselves into the current fiery class struggle, temper ourselves and reform ourselves in the storms and waves of class struggle. Only in this way can we cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Many Red Guards have deeply pointed out based on their experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution: The practice of class struggle is our best classroom. The current great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is also a great struggle between the two worldviews in people's minds. In the fiery class struggle, contradictions are the sharpest, struggles are the most intense, and it is the most effective in touching people's souls and testing everyone. We must throw ourselves into this fiery struggle to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, to clarify right and wrong, to better eliminate bourgeois thoughts and establish proletarian thoughts, to more effectively reform our worldviews, and to accelerate the revolutionization of our thoughts.

The heinous crimes of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party and his "In Cultivation" in fiercely opposing Mao Zedong Thought have aroused the extreme indignation of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary youth across the country. They said, the more the enemy opposes our study of Chairman Mao's works, the more we must study. We resolutely respond to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Revolutionary cadres from various regions also expressed that in the current revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, they must better learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, thoroughly eliminate the poison of "In Cultivation," and turn the entire country into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the moment when the revolutionary criticism of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party is becoming more and more intense, and when the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are being achieved one after another, the publication of the important article by the editorial departments of the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*, "The Essence of 'In Cultivation' is Betraying the Proletarian Dictatorship," has aroused a wave of cheers among the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces, pushing the army's powerful revolutionary criticism movement to develop rapidly to a deeper stage. The soldiers and officers proudly said: We are the proletarian armed forces personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly led by Vice Chairman Lin, the strongest pillars of the proletarian dictatorship. All our revolutionary struggles are for the sake of fighting for a red proletarian dictatorship and defending the great proletarian dictatorship. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party betrays the proletarian dictatorship and attempts to restore capitalism, which is simply a pipe dream. We must hold high the revolutionary banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the essence of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party's representative work—"In Cultivation," criticize and expose fiercely, and thoroughly overthrow and criticize him and his poisonous weed "In Cultivation"!

"Proletarian dictatorship is our lifeline. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party betrays the proletarian dictatorship and opposes the proletarian dictatorship, which is an attack on our lifeline. He is our mortal enemy, and we must overthrow him." In recent days, soldiers and officers from various units have firmly expressed this determination time and time again in discussion meetings and denunciation meetings. Zhang Jincang, a hero from the unit that shot down five invading American planes in eight days, said: Proletarian dictatorship is the lifeline of the laboring people. To seize power from imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we have struggled under the leadership of Chairman Mao for decades, and countless revolutionary martyrs have sacrificed their precious lives. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, like a bat fearing the sun, fears the proletarian dictatorship and tries every means to undermine our lifeline, attempting to restore capitalism in China and make us suffer again. We must, like fighting against enemy planes, decisively overthrow the Khrushchev of China and make him never rise again. Liu Hengyao, the political instructor of the third company of a certain unit stationed at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, said, Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental question of revolution is the question of power. He wants us to never forget the proletarian dictatorship. Our predecessors in the company have fought bravely, advancing from the banks of the Heilong River to the southernmost tip, to fight for a new China of proletarian dictatorship. For more than a decade, we have day and night guarded the frontline of the South China Sea, defending the ironclad mountains and rivers of the proletarian dictatorship won by the revolutionary martyrs with their blood. In the evil old society, we laboring people, because we did not seize power, suffered cruel oppression and exploitation from landlords and capitalists, generation after generation like cows and horses. My family alone had four people whose lives were taken by the cannibalistic old society. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party betrays the proletarian dictatorship and wants us to go back on our path, which we firmly refuse. The soldiers of the company where Qiu Shaoyun, the martyr, served said, Qiu Shaoyun, the martyr, sacrificed his life to defend the safety of the motherland of proletarian dictatorship. The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party's poisonous weed "In Cultivation" does not mention proletarian dictatorship and blatantly betrays the proletarian dictatorship, aiming to restore capitalism and establish bourgeois dictatorship. Above all, never forget the proletarian dictatorship is the most important, we must fight to the end with this enemy of the proletarian dictatorship!

With full hearts of class hatred, soldiers and officers have been denouncing and attacking the essence of "In Cultivation" and exposing the evil purposes of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party betraying the proletarian dictatorship. From naval docks, air force airfields to various military camps, soldiers and officers have angrily pointed out in denunciation meetings: The author of "In Cultivation" has betrayed the proletarian dictatorship and thus completely and thoroughly betrayed the proletarian revolutionary cause. Dai Xueming, the deputy political instructor of the "Sea Tiger Boat" on the front line of Fujian, who is always vigilant day and night, said: "In Cultivation" does not mention proletarian dictatorship at all, aiming to make us forget the proletarian dictatorship, so that he can comfortably achieve the restoration of capitalism. We frontline soldiers see it most clearly that the evil intentions of this Khrushchev of China exactly meet the needs of the Kuomintang bandits in Jinmen, Matsu, and Penghu in front of us, and exactly meet the needs of the U.S. imperialists and the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union. If we "cultivate" according to "In Cultivation" and lose our revolutionary vigilance, then last year on November 14, when the U.S.-Kuomintang warships harassed our fishing grounds east of Chongwu, we would not have been able to immediately take action and achieve the great victory of sinking and damaging one enemy ship each! After listening to this article on the radio, Wang Xuetian, the political instructor of the ninth company of a certain unit, which is an advanced unit in studying Chairman Mao's works, immediately organized the cadres and soldiers to review Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletarian dictatorship. He pointed out sharply: The greatest capitalist-roader in the Party deliberately covers up class struggle and does not mention proletarian dictatorship, not because he does not understand the importance of power. He talks about bourgeois "cultivation" and wants us to forget the proletarian dictatorship, which is exactly to serve his purpose of restoring capitalism and establishing the bourgeois dictatorship he needs. This is a great exposure of his old counter-revolutionary face! Yang Daogen, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and a combat hero from the Nanjing unit, said: "In Cultivation" does not mention proletarian dictatorship at all, covering up the proletarian dictatorship, aiming to disarm us ideologically and numb our fighting spirit; aiming to make us "cultivate" into political blind people who have no enemy in their hearts and no enemy in their eyes, so as to conveniently achieve his evil purpose of turning the proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. We have the boundless Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, and any tricks of the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party will never succeed.

Many soldiers and officers firmly expressed: We must never forget the proletarian dictatorship, we must defend the red mountains and rivers of the proletariat with our blood and lives, and we must thoroughly criticize and expose the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, throwing him into the trash can of history. Han Chunmao, the deputy company commander of the reconnaissance company of a certain unit in the Shenyang unit, who is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: Our army, since it was personally founded by Chairman Mao, has been a revolutionary force fighting to establish the proletarian dictatorship and defend the proletarian dictatorship. We must arm ourselves with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, hold the gun tightly, take up the pen, push the revolutionary criticism movement to a new stage, and fight for the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship all our lives, forever being the vanguard of defending the proletarian dictatorship.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗念念不忘无产阶级专政
    各地无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部文章发表
    解放军指战员决心把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派彻底打倒，把《修养》彻底批臭
    新华社九日讯　《红旗》杂志编辑部和《人民日报》编辑部重要文章《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》的发表，给正在进行革命大批判的各地无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将送来了新的思想武器，增添了无穷的战斗力量。连日来，全国各地许多工厂、农村、机关、学校的革命派纷纷召开座谈会、讨论会，学习这篇重要文章。各地无产阶级革命派表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，抓住党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的大毒草《修养》反对无产阶级专政的要害问题，穷追猛打，把这个老修正主义分子及其《修养》批倒批臭，彻底肃清他在各个领域内所散布的流毒，坚决保卫我们伟大的无产阶级专政。
    各地无产阶级革命派指出，《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部的文章一针见血地指出了《修养》的要害是背叛无产阶级专政，这个问题提得好，说得对，的确打中了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的要害，也说出了我们革命人民的心里话。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”没有无产阶级专政就没有我们劳动人民的一切。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的大毒草《修养》却千方百计地要人们忘记无产阶级专政，他的目的就是为了建立资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。各地无产阶级革命派表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，把当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判同本地区、本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，夺取无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的彻底胜利，保卫无产阶级的铁打的江山永不变色。
    各地的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将指出：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派要人们脱离火热的阶级斗争去进行“自我修养”，妄图叫我们脱离政治，脱离革命，不关心国家大事，忘记无产阶级的政权，这样“修养”的结果，只能“修”出大大小小的赫鲁晓夫，只能把我们社会主义的江山“修”掉。我们无产阶级革命派一定要和他针锋相对，反其道而行之。我们一定要积极地投身到当前火热的阶级斗争中去，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，经风雨，见世面，锻炼自己，改造自己，只有这样，才能把自己培养成为坚强可靠的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。许多红卫兵小将都结合自己在无产阶级文化大革命中的体会深刻地指出：阶级斗争的实践就是我们最好的课堂。当前这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，同时也是人们头脑中两种世界观的大搏斗。在火热的阶级斗争中，矛盾最尖锐，斗争最激烈，最能触及人们的灵魂，对每一个人都是严峻的考验。我们只有投身到这个火热的斗争中去，才能分清敌我，明辨是非，更好地灭资兴无，破私立公，更有成效地改造世界观，加速思想革命化。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其《修养》猖狂反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，激起了各地无产阶级革命派和革命小将的无比愤慨。他们说，敌人越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们就越是要学习。我们坚决响应林彪副主席的号召，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。各地无产阶级革命派还表示，在当前对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判中，一定要更好地在斗争中带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段，在毛泽东思想伟大红旗的指引下把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，彻底肃清《修养》的流毒，把全国都办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    新华社九日讯　在横扫党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判越来越猛烈的时刻，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得一个又一个伟大胜利的凯歌声中，《红旗》杂志和《人民日报》编辑部《〈修养〉的要害是背叛无产阶级专政》这篇重要文章的发表，激起了人民解放军陆海空三军广大指战员一片欢呼，推动全军气势磅礴的革命大批判运动迅速向着更深入的阶段发展。指战员们豪迈地说：我们是毛主席亲手缔造、林副统帅直接领导的无产阶级子弟兵，是无产阶级专政的最强大的柱石，我们的一切革命斗争就是为的打出一个红彤彤的无产阶级专政的天下，就是要保卫伟大的无产阶级专政。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，妄图复辟资本主义，这简直是白日做梦。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，抓住党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的代表作——《修养》的要害，猛批、狠批，把他和他的大毒草《修养》彻底打倒、批臭！
    “无产阶级专政是我们的命根子。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，反对无产阶级专政，就是向我们的命根子开刀。他是我们的死对头，我们一定要把他打倒。”连日来，各部队指战员们在座谈会和声讨会上，斩钉截铁地一遍又一遍地诉说着这个决心。八天内击落入侵美机五架的作战有功部队的战斗功臣张金堂说：无产阶级专政是劳动人民的命根子。为了从帝国主义、蒋介石反动派手中夺取政权，我们在毛主席的领导下，艰苦奋斗几十年，无数革命先烈献出了他们的宝贵生命。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派象蝙蝠害怕太阳一样，害怕无产阶级专政，千方百计要挖我们的命根子，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，让我们再受二遍苦。我们要象痛打敌机那样，利落地把中国的赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，叫它永世不得翻身。驻守海南岛天涯海角的某部三连指导员刘恒耀说，毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。要我们念念不忘无产阶级专政。我们连的前辈们前赴后继，英勇奋斗，从黑龙江畔，打到天涯海角，就是为了打出一个无产阶级专政的新中国。十多年来，我们连日日夜夜守卫在祖国南海最前哨，就是为了保卫革命先烈用鲜血换来的无产阶级专政的铁打江山。在万恶的旧社会，我们劳动人民，因为没有掌握政权，受尽地主、资本家的残酷压迫和剥削，世世代代当牛做马。我一家就有四人被吃人的旧社会夺去了生命。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，要我们走回头路，我们坚决不答应。邱少云生前所在连队的战士们说，邱少云烈士是为了保卫无产阶级专政的祖国的安全英勇牺牲的。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大毒草《修养》闭口不谈无产阶级专政，明目张胆地背叛无产阶级专政，其目的就是要复辟资本主义，实行资产阶级专政。千重要，万重要，念念不忘无产阶级专政最重要，我们一定要和这个无产阶级专政的死敌斗到底！
    怀着满腔的阶级仇恨，连日来，指战员们口诛笔伐猛攻《修养》的要害，狠揭党内头号走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政的罪恶目的。从海军码头、空军机场到各部队营区，指战员们在声讨会上愤怒指出：《修养》的作者背叛了无产阶级专政，也就完全地、彻底地背叛了无产阶级革命事业。日夜警惕地守卫在福建前线的“海上猛虎艇”副指导员戴学明说：《修养》根本不谈无产阶级专政，目的是要我们忘记无产阶级专政，让他舒舒服服地实现资本主义复辟。我们前线战士看得最清楚，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的恶毒用心，正适应我们眼前金马台澎的蒋介石匪帮的需要，正适应美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团的需要。我们若照《修养》去“修”，丧失革命警惕性，那么，前年十一月十四日，美蒋军舰骚扰我崇武以东渔场时，我们就不可能立即出动，取得一举击沉击伤敌舰各一艘的重大胜利！学习毛主席著作先进单位、某部九连指导员王学田从广播里听到这篇文章后，立即组织干部战士重温毛主席关于无产阶级专政的论述。他一针见血地说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派极力抹杀阶级斗争，不谈无产阶级专政，并不是他不懂得政权的重要性。他向我们大谈资产阶级“修养”，妄图要我们忘记无产阶级专政，这正是为他复辟资本主义，建立他所需要的资产阶级专政服务的。这是他的老反革命嘴脸的大暴露！南京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、战斗英雄杨道根说：《修养》只字不谈无产阶级专政，抹杀无产阶级专政，目的就是要从思想上解除我们的武装，麻痹我们的斗志；就是要我们闭门“修”成心里没有敌情、眼里没有敌人的政治瞎子，以便于他实现他的变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政的罪恶目的。我们有光焰无际的毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的任何阴谋诡计都永远无法得逞。
    许多部队指战员坚定地表示：一定要念念不忘无产阶级专政，一定要用鲜血和生命捍卫无产阶级的红色江山，坚决把党内头号走资本主义道路当权派批倒批臭，扔进历史的垃圾箱。沈阳部队学习毛主席著作积极分子、某部侦察连副连长韩春茂说：我军从毛主席亲手缔造那一天起，就是一支为建立无产阶级专政、捍卫无产阶级专政而战斗的革命队伍，我们就是要用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装头脑，紧握枪杆，拿起笔杆，把革命的大批判运动推向新的阶段，为巩固无产阶级专政战斗一辈子，永远做保卫无产阶级专政的尖兵。
