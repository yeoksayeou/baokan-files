Seven Hundred Million Chinese People Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Resolutely Support the Just Struggles of the Arab People

The Arab People Will Defeat the U.S. Imperialists and Their Lackey Israel as Long as They Unite and Persist in Struggle

New China News Agency, May 27th — The Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on May 27th. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China

May 27, 1967

At present, U.S. imperialism is using Israel to hatch a grand conspiracy to invade Syria, invade the United Arab Republic, and invade Arab countries. The Israeli Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have repeatedly threatened to take military action against Syria and overthrow the Syrian government. Israel has massed large numbers of troops on the Syrian and Israeli-UAR borders, ready to launch a large-scale military adventure at any moment. The U.S. Sixth Fleet has entered the eastern Mediterranean, flaunting its military might and making military threats. The independence and security of Arab countries are facing serious threats. The facts once again prove that U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit supporting Israel's aggression against Arab countries and is the most vicious enemy of the Arab peoples.

Facing the aggression and war threats of U.S. imperialism and Israel, the Arab peoples are united in their hatred of the enemy, rising up in unison, and resolutely fighting back. Syria, the UAR, and other countries have declared a state of war preparedness, ready to give the aggressors a crushing blow at any moment. The UAR has demanded that the United Nations Emergency Force withdraw from the Gaza Strip and UAR territory and has declared a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, prohibiting Israeli ships from passing through. The Arab League Council has passed a resolution stating that any attack on Arab territory will be considered an aggression against all Arab countries. Iraq, Yemen, Algeria, and other Arab countries have taken emergency measures to support the struggles of the Syrian and UAR peoples. The actions taken by Arab countries are just actions, self-defense actions against aggression and oppression, and fully in line with the interests of the Arab peoples.

The struggle of the Arab peoples against U.S. imperialism and Zionism is an important part of the world anti-imperialist struggle. This struggle has dealt a powerful blow to imperialism and old and new colonialism and has powerfully supported the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of all countries. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought stand firmly on the side of the Arab peoples and resolutely support all their just struggles. The Chinese people will forever be the Arab peoples' loyal and reliable anti-imperialist comrades-in-arms.

At present, U.S. imperialism is showing its fangs, openly threatening to use force to compel the UAR to open the Gulf of Aqaba on the one hand, and on the other, U.S. imperialist leader Johnson and the likes of UN Secretary-General U Thant are conspiring and plotting, attempting to use the United Nations as their tool to strangle the anti-imperialist struggles of Arab countries. The frequent contacts between the U.S., Soviet Union, Britain, and France, and Brown's visit to Moscow, are all aimed at using their so-called "big power status" to dominate the fate of the Arab peoples and force the Arab peoples to submit. However, no matter what tricks they play or what threats they use, they cannot intimidate or deceive the increasingly awakened Arab peoples. On the contrary, U.S. imperialism's aggressive behavior, bullying, and rampant behavior do not indicate its strength but rather its desperation and cowardice. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "U.S. imperialism's hand has reached too far. Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the encirclement of the peoples of the whole world." U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam has already suffered a shameful defeat, and its aggression against Arab countries will also meet a bad end. The day when the peoples of the whole world will thoroughly bury U.S. imperialism is not far off.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism. It serves U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war everywhere. At a time when the Arab peoples are launching a new high tide of struggle against U.S. and Israeli aggression, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is once again colluding with U.S. and British imperialism, making political deals, and peddling the black goods of the "Tashkent spirit," attempting to sabotage the Arab peoples' anti-imperialist just cause. It does not mention the most essential issue of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Arab countries and does not support the UAR's just actions of demanding the withdrawal of UN troops and blocking the Gulf of Aqaba. This is a barefaced act of betrayal. We believe that the Arab peoples, who have a tradition of anti-imperialist struggle, will be able to see through the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's betrayal of the interests of the Arab peoples through their own experiences and will not be fooled by it.

The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "The peoples of the whole world must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties, and go forward unyieldingly. In that case, the whole world will surely belong to the peoples. All devils will be thoroughly annihilated." The Arab nation is a great nation. The Arab people are heroic people. As long as they unite and persist in struggle, the Arab people will surely be able to defeat U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel and achieve victory in their struggle.

The Arab people will win! U.S. imperialism will be defeated!

### 用毛泽东思想武装的七亿中国人民  坚决支持阿拉伯人民一切正义斗争

    我国政府发表声明
    用毛泽东思想武装的七亿中国人民  坚决支持阿拉伯人民一切正义斗争
    阿拉伯人民只要团结一致坚持斗争就一定能打败美帝及其走狗以色列
    新华社二十七日讯　中华人民共和国政府二十七日发表声明，声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
              一九六七年五月二十七日
    目前，美帝国主义正在利用以色列，策划一个侵略叙利亚、侵略阿联、侵略阿拉伯国家的大阴谋。以色列总理和外长一再叫嚣要对叙利亚采取战争行动，打垮叙利亚政府。以色列在以叙、以阿（联）边境集结大量部队，准备随时进行大规模的军事冒险。美国第六舰队开入东地中海，大肆炫耀武力，进行军事恫吓。阿拉伯国家的独立和安全面临着严重的威胁。事实再一次说明，美帝国主义是支持以色列对阿拉伯国家进行侵略的罪魁祸首，是阿拉伯各国人民最凶恶的敌人。
    面对美帝国主义和以色列的侵略和战争威胁，阿拉伯各国人民同仇敌忾，一致奋起，坚决进行斗争。叙利亚、阿联等国已经宣布进入战备状态，随时准备给予侵略者以迎头痛击。阿联已要求联合国紧急部队撤离加沙地区和阿联领土，并宣布封锁亚喀巴湾，不许以色列船只通行。阿拉伯联盟理事会通过决议，声明对任何阿拉伯领土的进攻，将被认为是对全体阿拉伯国家的侵略。伊拉克、也门、阿尔及利亚等阿拉伯国家都采取了紧急措施，支持叙利亚和阿联人民的斗争。阿拉伯国家采取的这些行动，是正义的行动，是反抗侵略、反抗压迫的自卫行动，完全符合阿拉伯人民的利益。
    阿拉伯人民反对美帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争，是世界反帝斗争的一个重要组成部分。这个斗争有力地打击了帝国主义和新老殖民主义，有力地支援了世界各国人民的反帝斗争。用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，坚决站在阿拉伯人民一边，坚决支持他们的一切正义斗争。中国人民永远是阿拉伯人民忠实可靠的反帝战友。
    目前，美帝凶相毕露，一方面公开威胁要使用武力，迫使阿联开放亚喀巴湾；另一方面，美帝头子约翰逊和联合国秘书长吴丹之流，正在密谋策划，妄图利用联合国这个御用工具，扼杀阿拉伯国家的反帝斗争。美苏英法接触频繁，布朗访问莫斯科，目的都是为了利用它们的所谓“大国地位”，主宰阿拉伯人民的命运，迫使阿拉伯人民屈服。但是，不管它们玩弄什么花招，使用什么威胁手段，都吓不倒和欺骗不了日益觉醒的阿拉伯人民。相反，美帝国主义这样张牙舞爪，到处侵略，横行霸道，绝不表明它的强大，而是它走投无路、色厉内荏的表现。毛主席早就指出过：“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”美帝国主义对越南的侵略已经遭到可耻的失败，它对阿拉伯国家的侵略也决不会有好下场。全世界人民彻底埋葬美帝国主义的日子已经不远了。
    苏联修正主义领导集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。它到处为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳。目前，正当阿拉伯人民掀起一次反对美帝和以色列侵略的新高潮的时候，苏修领导集团又同美英帝国主义狼狈为奸，大作政治交易，大力贩卖“塔什干精神”的黑货，妄想破坏阿拉伯人民的反帝正义事业。它绝口不谈美帝国主义侵略阿拉伯国家这一最本质的问题，也不支持阿联要求联合国撤军和封锁亚喀巴湾的正义行动。这是一种赤裸裸的背叛行为。我们相信，具有反帝斗争传统的阿拉伯人民，通过亲身的体验，一定能够识破苏修领导集团出卖阿拉伯人民利益的丑恶嘴脸。而绝不会上它的当。
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”阿拉伯民族是伟大的民族。阿拉伯人民是英雄的人民。只要团结一致，坚持斗争，阿拉伯人民就一定能够打败美帝国主义和它的走狗以色列，取得斗争的胜利。
    阿拉伯人民必胜！美帝国主义必败！
