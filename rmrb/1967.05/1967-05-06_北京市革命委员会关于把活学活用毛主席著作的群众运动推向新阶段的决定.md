Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought represents a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in our era, and the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation. It is the action guideline for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary forces seize power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and they hold and consolidate power relying on Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline and the source of all our strength.

For over a decade, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, under the protection and support of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, has viciously attacked our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, and fiercely opposed the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They have relentlessly sabotaged the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The proletarian revolutionary forces have an infinite love, faith, loyalty, and admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. We must study Chairman Mao's works extensively, establish Mao Zedong Thought firmly, thoroughly purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought in every corner of Beijing. We must ensure that the capital, where Chairman Mao resides, is forever in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary forces, never to change color.

Currently, our combat mission is to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to expose and criticize more thoroughly and deeply the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. We must, according to different situations, gradually transition to and carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our own units. To accomplish this glorious and arduous task, we must further grasp Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon, and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must actively respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call to advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage.

To this end, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee decides:

1. We must firmly grasp the issue of attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought. Whether one acknowledges or resists, supports or opposes, loves or hates Mao Zedong Thought, is the dividing line and touchstone between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries, between revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, and between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. All revolutionary masses in the city must genuinely place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works above everything else, greater than everything else, before everything else, and heavier than everything else. They must use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, drive everything, and transform everything. All revolutionary units in the city must fully utilize the *Beijing Daily* and other propaganda tools to frequently and extensively propagate the utmost importance of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This will make the revolutionary masses in the city voluntarily study and apply, study for the revolution, and apply for the revolution. They must truly regard Chairman Mao's books as the highest directives for all work, imprint Chairman Mao's teachings in their minds, dissolve them in their blood, and implement them in their actions.

2. In the course of deep criticism, we must thoroughly understand and grasp Mao Zedong Thought. The biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party are the chief representatives of the restoration of capitalism in our country and the main backers of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Over the past seventeen years, they have proposed and stubbornly adhered to a bourgeois reactionary line in all fronts and fields. The proletarian revolutionary line, with Chairman Mao as the representative, has engaged in a long and resolute struggle against this bourgeois reactionary line. All revolutionary masses in the city must, in the course of revolutionary criticism, seriously study Chairman Mao's expositions on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. They must take the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party as negative examples, and in conjunction with the criticism of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee's counter-revolutionary revisionist clique and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their own units, thoroughly criticize and expose this bourgeois reactionary line politically, ideologically, and theoretically. This will enable us to more thoroughly understand and grasp Mao Zedong Thought and better implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

3. While transforming the objective world, the proletarian revolutionary forces must strive to transform their subjective world. Comrade Lin Biao said: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be successful." Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for us to transform the objective world and the subjective world. Currently, at the decisive moment of the two-line struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, anarchism, factionalism, and individualism have become active again, diverting our struggle targets and shifting the direction of our struggle. All proletarian revolutionary forces in the city must fight while rectifying their style. They must seriously study the "Three Articles" and the brilliant work *On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party*, carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially self-criticism, and launch a great revolution in the depths of the soul to eliminate "private" interests and establish "public" interests. They must vigorously sweep away anarchism, factionalism, and individualism, and strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat. They must seriously study *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People* and, in accordance with the principle of "unity-criticism-unity," correctly handle contradictions among the people using the method of presenting facts and reasoning. Comrades who have been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line must, in the course of deep criticism, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply touch their souls, thoroughly eliminate "private" interests, and free themselves from the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line. They must return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary forces. Based on Mao Zedong Thought, we must further expand and consolidate the great alliance of the revolution, forming a mighty army of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with the proletarian leftists as the core.

4. While criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a few," we must seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, and "unite with the majority and strike down a few." For cadres who have made mistakes, we must adhere to the principle of "punishing the past to educate the future and curing the sickness to save the patient" and wholeheartedly support and help them join the revolution. As long as they are not anti-Party and anti-socialist elements who insist on their mistakes and are incorrigible, we must allow them to correct their mistakes and encourage them to make amends. Cadres who have made mistakes must, in the course of this mass criticism movement, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, smash the spiritual shackles of *Self-Cultivation*, and use actual actions to show that they have drawn a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line and resolutely stood on the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

5. We must strengthen the consciousness of class struggle, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion, and resolutely defeat the frenzied counterattacks of the class enemies in various forms, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary forces have not ended the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We must recognize that seizing power is not easy, holding power is not easy, and consolidating this proletarian dictatorship is even more difficult. The proletarian revolutionary forces must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy bravely than to seek fame by learning from King Xiang Yu." We must seriously study the brilliant works *Carry the Revolution Through to the End* and *Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China*.

6. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call for supporting the army and loving the people. We must seriously study Chairman Mao's expositions on supporting the army and loving the people and resolutely, comprehensively, and correctly implement the eight-point and ten-point orders issued by the Central Military Commission. The People's Liberation Army is the great army personally created and led by our great leader, Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. It is a highly proletarianized and combat-ready army. The People's Liberation Army has established immortal merits in the great cause of the people's revolution in our country and in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, it has set a brilliant example for the people of the entire nation. The revolutionary masses must learn from the People's Liberation Army and support the army. The army must correctly treat the masses and love the people.

7. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call for "grasping the revolution and promoting production." We must always remember the teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." At any time, we must prioritize the revolution, use the revolution to lead production, mobilize all positive factors, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production, achieving double victories in the revolution and production.

8. The main focus of studying Chairman Mao's works is to study Chairman Mao's most thorough proletarian worldview, and to study Chairman Mao's most complete and highest unification of proletarian revolutionary spirit and scientific spirit. At the same time, we must seriously study the working methods and styles created by Chairman Mao in developing Marxism-Leninism. All these are compulsory courses for the proletarian revolutionary forces.

This May marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's *Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art*. This work brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and literary theory, and is a landmark document and a programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must seriously study this brilliant work and the *Minutes of the Conference on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Delegated to Comrade Jiang Qing*. All responsible persons of revolutionary organizations, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary literary and art workers must go deep among the masses, stay with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and never leave the masses or the fiery struggle. Together with the broad revolutionary masses, we must thoroughly overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party in the literary and art circles!

9. In studying Chairman Mao's works, we must grasp the Marxist-Leninist method of study: "Study with questions in mind, apply actively, combine study with application, learn what is urgently needed first, see immediate results, and strive hard in application." We must study in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and apply in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, study a little, apply a little, study repeatedly, apply repeatedly, arm our minds with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the revolutionization of our thinking.

10. All departments, units, and revolutionary organizations must establish specialized institutions to guide the study of Chairman Mao's works or designate specific persons to be in charge. They must establish unbreakable study systems. All levels of leading cadres and responsible persons of revolutionary organizations must take the lead in studying, applying, and transforming their thinking; and they must study and apply together with the masses, grasp typical examples, promote from points to surfaces, and regularly convene political work meetings to timely summarize and exchange experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works.

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee calls upon: All revolutionary masses and cadres in the city, in this revolutionary mass criticism movement, must charge forward, fight bravely, and in the struggle, advance the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieve new levels in study and application, create new situations, and launch new high tides. Let us build the capital into a great school for studying Mao Zedong Thought, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high forever in the sky of the capital! Let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought forever illuminate the path of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

    北京市革命委员会关于把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段的决定 
    （一九六七年五月五日）
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的一个崭新阶段，是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针，是无产阶级文化大革命的行动指南。无产阶级革命派夺取政权靠毛泽东思想，掌握政权和巩固政权也靠毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是我们一切力量的源泉。
    十几年来，旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的庇护和支持下，恶毒地攻击我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，疯狂地反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，拚命地破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。无产阶级革命派对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚，无限崇拜。我们要大学毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想，彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍北京的每一寸土地，让毛主席居住的首都永远掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，千秋万代永不变色。
    当前，摆在我们面前的战斗任务，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更全面地、更深入地揭露和批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和旧北京市委一小撮反革命修正主义分子，并且按照不同的情况，逐步地转入并搞好本单位的斗、批、改。我们要完成这个光荣而艰巨的任务，就一定要进一步掌握毛泽东思想这个威力无穷的思想武器，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们要积极响应林彪同志的号召，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段。
    为此，北京市革命委员会决定：
    一、要狠抓对待毛泽东思想的态度问题。对毛泽东思想抱什么态度，是承认还是抵制，是拥护还是反对，是热爱还是仇视，这是真革命和假革命，革命和反革命，马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义的分水岭和试金石。全市的革命群众，应该切切实实地把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，指导一切，带动一切，改造一切。全市各单位的无产阶级革命派，要充分运用《北京日报》和其他各种宣传工具，经常地从各方面大力宣传活学活用毛主席著作的头等重要意义，使全市的革命群众自觉地学，自觉地用，为革命而学，为革命而用，真正把毛主席的书当作各项工作的最高指示，把毛主席的教导印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。
    二、要在大批判中深刻领会和掌握毛泽东思想。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是在我国复辟资本主义的总代表，是旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的总后台。十七年来，他们在各条战线上、各个领域里，提出并顽固地坚持了一条资产阶级反动路线。以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同这条资产阶级反动路线进行了长期的坚决的斗争。全市的革命群众要在革命的大批判中，认真学习毛主席关于两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的论述，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作为反面教员，结合对旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的批判和本单位的斗、批、改，从政治上、思想上、理论上把这条资产阶级反动路线批倒、批臭。这样就可以使我们更深刻地领会和掌握毛泽东思想，更好地贯彻执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    三、无产阶级革命派在改造客观世界的同时，必须努力改造自己的主观世界。林彪同志说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”毛泽东思想就是我们改造客观世界和改造主观世界的最锐利的武器。目前，在无产阶级文化大革命两条路线的决战关头，无政府主义、山头主义、个人主义又活跃起来，分散我们的斗争目标，转移斗争的大方向。全市的无产阶级革命派，必须边战斗，边整风。要认真学习“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，开展批评和自我批评，特别是要多进行自我批评，在灵魂深处开展破“私”立“公”的大革命，大力扫除无政府主义、山头主义和个人主义，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。要认真学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，按照“团结——批评——团结”的方针，用摆事实讲道理的方法，正确处理人民内部矛盾。受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的同志，要在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，狠触灵魂，大破“私”字，从资产阶级反动路线的毒害下解放出来，回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。毛泽东思想是无产阶级革命派大联合的灵魂。要在毛泽东思想的基础上，进一步扩大和巩固革命的大联合，组成一支以无产阶级左派为核心的浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军。
    四、在批判对干部“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分的同时，要认真学习和坚决执行毛主席制定的干部政策，要“团结大多数，打击一小撮”。对于犯错误的干部，要坚持“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针，满腔热情地支持和帮助他们起来革命。只要不是反党反社会主义分子而又坚持不改和累教不改的，就要允许他们改过，鼓励他们将功赎罪。犯有错误的干部，在当前这场群众性的大批判运动中，要以毛泽东思想为武器，打碎《修养》这一精神枷锁，要用实际行动表明自己同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，坚决站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    五、加强阶级斗争观念，继续发扬革命造反精神，坚决打垮阶级敌人以各种形式出现的疯狂反扑，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。无产阶级革命派在夺权以后，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。必须认识到，夺权不容易，掌权也不容易，要巩固这一无产阶级专政更不容易。无产阶级革命派要牢记毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”要认真学习《将革命进行到底》和《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》等光辉著作。
    六、要坚决响应毛主席提出的拥军爱民的伟大号召。要认真学习毛主席关于拥军爱民的论述，要坚决地、全面地、正确地执行中央军委先后颁发的八条命令和十条命令。中国人民解放军是我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林彪副统帅直接指挥的一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的军队。中国人民解放军在我国人民革命的伟大事业中，在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中建立了不朽的功勋。在活学活用毛主席著作方面，为全国人民树立了光辉榜样。革命群众一定要向解放军学习，要拥军。军队要正确地对待群众，要爱民。
    七、要坚决响应毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召。要牢牢地记住“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”这个教导，在任何时候，都要把革命放在首位，用革命统帅生产，调动一切积极因素，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命和生产的双胜利。
    八、学习毛主席著作主要的是要学习毛主席的最彻底的无产阶级世界观，学习毛主席最完整地、最高度地统一起来的无产阶级革命精神和科学精神。同时也要认真地学习毛主席所创造性地发展了的马克思列宁主义的工作方法和工作作风。所有这些都是无产阶级革命派的必修课。
    今年五月，是毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年。这部著作天才地、创造性地、全面地发展了马克思列宁主义世界观和文艺理论，是一部划时代的重要文献，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件。我们必须好好学习这部光辉著作以及《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》。一切革命组织的负责人、革命干部、革命文艺工作者，都要深入群众，和工农兵在一起，一刻也不脱离群众，一刻也不脱离火热的斗争。要和广大革命群众一起，彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在文艺界的反革命修正主义路线！
    九、学习毛主席著作，要掌握“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫”这一马克思列宁主义的学习方法。要在无产阶级文化大革命中学，在无产阶级文化大革命中用，学一点，用一点，反复学，反复用，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，搞好思想革命化。
    十、各部门、各单位、各革命组织，都要设置专门指导学习毛主席著作的机构或指定专人负责，都要规定雷打不动的学习制度。各级领导干部和革命组织的负责人，要带头学，带头用，带头改造思想；并且要和群众一起学，一起用，抓住典型，以点带面，定期召开政治工作会议，及时总结和交流学习毛主席著作的经验。
    北京市革命委员会号召：全市广大革命群众和革命干部，在这场革命的群众性的大批判中，要冲锋陷阵，英勇战斗，在斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新的阶段，学出新的水平，用出新的水平，出现新的局面，掀起新的高潮，把人民的首都建设成一个学习毛泽东思想的大学校，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在首都的上空高高飘扬，永远飘扬！让光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远照耀中国革命和世界革命的大道！
