At a critical moment in the great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in our country, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China published the May 16 Notification of 1966! This is a major event in the political life of our country and also a major event in the international communist movement. The proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanghai enthusiastically welcome the publication of this great historical document! We enthusiastically hail the victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line!

The May 16 Notification of 1966 by the Party Central Committee is the first programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. It was formulated under the personal direction of our most beloved and respected great leader, Chairman Mao. This great Marxist-Leninist document systematically proposes the theory, line, principles, and policies of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Over the past year, the achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have fully proven that this great document creatively develops Marxism-Leninism, solves the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the prevention of capitalist restoration, and is a new and great milestone in the history of Marxism.

This great historical document tells us that after the proletariat seizes power, there is still the problem of consolidating that power. In a socialist society, especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, class struggle and the possibility of capitalist restoration still exist. This class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat is concentrated on the question of power, that is, whether the proletariat will consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or whether the bourgeoisie will overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. To consolidate their power, the proletariat must not only achieve dominance in politics and economics but also in culture; they must not only counter individual bourgeois attacks but also launch a comprehensive offensive against the bourgeoisie. In this comprehensive offensive, the most important task is to fully mobilize the masses to continuously expose and criticize the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated and hidden within the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles, dragging them out into the light of day to be overthrown, defeated, and exposed!

Over the past year, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, following the direction indicated in the Notification, have exposed such a group of bourgeois representatives from the central government, various central agencies, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, especially the "Khrushchev-like figures" mentioned in the Notification, that is, the top capitalist-roaders within the Party. This has exposed the cover of the struggle between the two lines over the past seventeen years. Exposing the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and thoroughly settling accounts with their poison in all aspects is a matter of the utmost importance concerning the fate of our socialist country and the future of the world revolution. It is the greatest victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven: In the struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries must, as indicated in the Notification, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Only in this way can they continuously advance from victory to victory. If they deviate from this direction, the struggle will encounter serious twists and turns. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen, in his "Report Outline," advocated that "everyone makes mistakes," that "everyone is equal before the truth," that there should be a "free-for-all," and even that firm leftists are "academic authorities," etc. The purpose was precisely to divert the direction of the struggle in order to protect the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and direct the spearhead at the proletarian revolutionaries. The main purpose of the bourgeois reactionary line executed by the Chinese Khrushchev during the Cultural Revolution was also to achieve this evil goal of reversing the direction of the struggle.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Shanghai are the henchmen of the Chinese Khrushchev. At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they colluded with the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen and his backers, actively passing on information. To save themselves and the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they either suppressed the revolutionary masses and implemented white terror or, in personnel matters, implemented the reactionary policy of "striking a large area and protecting a small handful," deliberately muddying the waters, or they spread the evil wind of economism, attempting to corrupt the revolutionary masses and sabotage the socialist economy. In short, whatever methods they used, they were all aimed at diverting the direction of the struggle. The proletarian revolutionaries of Shanghai, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, tightly seized the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and carried out a struggle to seize power from below, especially through the recent series of city-wide televised struggle meetings, completely exposing their counter-revolutionary faces before the people of the entire city.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai is excellent, but the tasks before us are still arduous. We must resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, seriously study the Notification, this great historical document, and, combining it with the experience of the struggle, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought. In the struggle to achieve a complete victory in this Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries must never forget the direction of the struggle, and we must not waste our energy on non-principled "internal wars," doing things that cause pain to friends and joy to enemies. We should seriously study the works of Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, thoroughly expose, defeat, and overthrow the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, achieve and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the great criticism, promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units, thoroughly eliminate the poison left by the Chinese Khrushchev on all fronts, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    千万不能忘记斗争大方向
    上海市革命委员会　徐景贤
    正当我国两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，中国共产党中央委员会一九六六年五月十六日《通知》公开发表了！这是我们国家政治生活中的一个重大事件，也是国际共产主义运动中的一个重大事件。我们上海的无产阶级革命派热烈欢呼这个伟大的历史文件的发表！热烈欢呼毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
    党中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，是我国无产阶级文化大革命的第一个纲领性文件。它是在我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自主持下制定的。这个伟大的马克思列宁主义的文件，系统地提出了无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。一年来，无产阶级文化大革命的成就已经充分证明，这个伟大的文件创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，是马克思主义发展史上一座崭新的伟大的里程碑。
    这个伟大的历史文件告诉我们，无产阶级在夺取政权以后，还有个巩固政权的问题。在社会主义社会里，特别是在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本上完成以后，仍然存在着阶级和阶级斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的可能。这种无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，就是政权问题，就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。无产阶级要巩固自己的政权，就不仅要在政治上经济上取得统治地位，而且要在文化上取得统治地位；不仅要对资产阶级的进攻进行个别的反击，而且要向资产阶级发起全面的进攻。在全面的进攻中，最主要的任务是充分发动群众，自下而上地不断清除混进和隐藏在党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，把他们揪出来暴露在光天化日之下，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭！
    一年来，广大无产阶级革命派沿着《通知》所指出的方向，从中央，中央各机关，各省、市、自治区，都揪出了这样一批资产阶级代表人物，特别重要的是揪出了《通知》中所说的“赫鲁晓夫那样的人物”，即党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，从而揭开了十七年来两条路线斗争的盖子。把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揭露出来，并彻底清算他们在各方面的流毒，这是一个关系到我们社会主义国家命运和世界革命前途的头等重要的大事，是无产阶级文化大革命的最伟大的胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明：无产阶级革命派在斗争中，必须按照《通知》中所指出的，牢牢把握斗争的大方向，把矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能不断地从胜利走向胜利。如果背离了这个大方向，斗争就会出现严重的曲折和反复。反革命修正主义分子彭真在《汇报提纲》中，鼓吹“错误人人有份”，“在真理面前人人平等”，说什么要“混战一场”，甚至把坚定的左派骂为“学阀”等等，目的正是为了要转移斗争的大方向，以保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，而把矛头对准无产阶级革命派。中国的赫鲁晓夫在文化大革命中所执行的资产阶级反动路线，主要也是为了达到这个扭转斗争大方向的罪恶目的。
    上海市党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是中国的赫鲁晓夫的党羽。在无产阶级文化大革命开始的时候，他们便与反革命修正主义分子彭真及其后台勾搭起来，积极地通风报信。他们为了保存自己，保存党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，或则压制革命群众，实行白色恐怖；或则在干部问题上实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动政策，有意把水搅混；或则大刮经济主义妖风，妄图腐蚀革命群众，破坏社会主义经济。总之，无论他们采取那一种手段，都是为了转移斗争的大方向。上海市的无产阶级革命派，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，牢牢把握住斗争的大方向，紧紧揪住一小撮反革命修正主义分子不放，对他们进行自下而上的夺权斗争，特别是通过最近连续多次的全市电视斗争大会，把他们及其后台中国的赫鲁晓夫的反革命嘴脸完全暴露在全市人民面前。
    当前，上海无产阶级文化大革命的形势大好，但摆在我们面前的任务还很艰巨。我们要坚决响应党中央的号召，认真地学习《通知》这个伟大的历史文件，结合斗争实践中的经验，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己。在夺取这次文化大革命彻底胜利的斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派千万不要忘记斗争的大方向，不要把精力消耗在无原则的“内战”中，干那些亲者痛、仇者快的事情。我们应该认真地学习毛主席著作，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，彻底斗臭、斗垮、斗倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在大批判中实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，推动本单位的斗批改，彻底肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫在各条战线上所遗留下来的毒害，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
