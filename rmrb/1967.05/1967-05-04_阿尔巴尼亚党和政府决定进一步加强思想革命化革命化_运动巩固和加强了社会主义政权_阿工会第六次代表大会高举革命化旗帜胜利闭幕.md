Albania's Party and Government Decide to Further Strengthen Thought Revolutionization

The Revolutionization Movement Consolidates and Strengthens the Socialist Regime

The Sixth Congress of the Albanian Trade Unions Successfully Concludes Under the Banner of Revolutionization

	NEW DELHI, May 1 (Xinhua) — The Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Council of Ministers of Albania issued a joint statement on the eve of International Labour Day, discussing the great achievements of Albania's revolutionization movement and proposing further development of the revolutionization movement.

	The statement issued on April 30 pointed out that the historic resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha's speech on "Further Revolutionization of the Party and the State" on February 6 this year have received active responses from the broad masses of the people in cities and countryside of Albania. Under the correct line of the Party of Labour, the working people of Albania have pushed the socialist revolution forward in all fields, launched a series of revolutionization movements, and put forward a series of revolutionary initiatives with profound political, ideological, economic, and social content. These movements and initiatives are conducive to consolidating and strengthening the socialist economy and the people's regime, raising the revolutionary spirit and class consciousness of the working people, and preventing the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism.

	The statement said that this year's series of revolutionization movements and initiatives have played a tremendous role in promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. The total industrial output for the first quarter of this year was 103.4% of the plan, an increase of 7% over the same period last year. In less than three months, the mountainous areas have successfully completed agricultural collectivization. In all agricultural cooperatives, a revolutionary movement to open up wastelands and strengthen the collective economy has been launched. The amount of wasteland opened up in the first quarter of this year was 39.2% more than in the same period last year.

	The statement said that the initiatives regarding cadres and intellectuals participating more broadly and directly in productive labor, revolutionizing education, activating rural cultural life, and serving the people with art have powerfully promoted the revolutionary education of mental workers and strengthened their ties with the masses. On the ideological front, a great class struggle is being waged to smash all bourgeois and revisionist ideas, feudal and patriarchal backward customs, religious superstitions, and everything that is incompatible with our country's new socialist life.

	The statement then proposed the issue of further developing the revolutionization movement: First, the issue of reducing the private economy of agricultural cooperative members and abolishing the private plots of state farm workers; second, cadres participating more in productive labor and, without affecting the middle and lower levels of wages, further reducing high wages; third, the issue of abolishing and restricting many material incentives and placing spiritual encouragement above material incentives; fourth, some economic measures to reduce the burden on agricultural cooperatives and further lower the prices of daily necessities for the whole people.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, the Sixth Congress of the Albanian Trade Unions, which was held under the banner of revolutionization, successfully concluded on April 27 in Tirana.

	The beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, as well as party and government leaders such as Shehu and List, attended the closing ceremony.

	This congress listened to and discussed the report by Todi Jakova, General Secretary of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions, entitled "On the Work of the Central Council of Albanian Trade Unions and the Tasks for Implementing the Resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania." The representatives expressed their complete agreement and unanimously adopted Jakova's report. The representatives expressed their determination to implement the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and the revolutionary measures proposed in Comrade Enver Hoxha's report on February 6, together with the people of the whole country, to achieve the thought revolutionization of the working class.

	During the congress, 28 foreign trade union delegations, invited to attend the congress, delivered congratulatory speeches. Many representatives, in their speeches, highly praised the glorious achievements of the Albanian working class and people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction under the leadership of the Party of Labour of Albania headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, enthusiastically sang the praises of Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and expressed their determination to follow the path of Mao Zedong, to wage armed struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism.

	The congress adopted a resolution supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation.

	The congress elected a new leadership of the central trade union in the morning of April 27. Nushi was elected chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions, and Todi Jakova was elected general secretary.

    新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和阿尔巴尼亚部长会议在“五一”国际劳动节前夕发表一项公告，谈到了阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动的巨大成就，提出进一步开展革命化运动的问题。
    四月三十日发表的这个公告指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的历史性决议和霍查同志今年二月六日“关于党和政权的进一步革命化”的讲话得到了阿尔巴尼亚城乡广大人民群众积极的响应。在劳动党的正确路线的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民把各个领域里的社会主义革命推向前进，开展了一系列革命化运动，提出了一系列具有深刻的政治、思想、经济和社会内容的革命倡议。这些运动和倡议有利于巩固和加强社会主义经济和人民政权，有利于提高劳动人民的革命精神和阶级觉悟，有利于防止修正主义的产生和资本主义复辟。
    公告在谈到今年以来开展一系列的革命化运动和提出一系列的倡议，对促进工农业生产的发展所起的巨大作用时说，今年第一季度工业总产量计划完成了百分之一百零三点四，比去年同期增长百分之七。在不到三个月的时间里，山区胜利地完成了农业合作化。在所有的农业社开展了开荒和加强集体经济的革命运动。今年第一季度开垦的荒地比去年同期多百分之三十九点二。
    公告说，关于干部和知识分子更广泛地直接参加生产劳动、教育革命化、活跃农村文化生活、艺术为人民服务等倡议，有力地促进对脑力劳动者的革命教育，加强他们同群众的联系。在思想战线上，为了粉碎一切资产阶级和修正主义思想、封建和宗法的落后习俗、宗教迷信以及一切同我国社会主义新生活毫不调和的东西，正在展开一场巨大的阶级斗争。
    公告接着提出进一步开展革命化运动的问题：第一、关于减少农业社员自留经济和取消国营农场职工的自留地的问题；第二、干部更多地直接参加生产劳动和在不触动中、下水平的工资的情况下，进一步降低高工资的问题；第三、关于取消和限制许多物质刺激以及把精神鼓励放在物质刺激之上的问题；第四、关于减轻农业合作社负担的一些经济措施和为全民进一步降低日用消费品价格的问题。
    据新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚工会第六次代表大会高举革命化的旗帜于四月二十七日在地拉那胜利闭幕。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志以及谢胡、列希等党政领导人出席了闭幕式。
    这次代表大会听取并讨论了阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会总书记托·雅科瓦所作的“关于阿尔巴尼亚工会中央理事会的工作和为贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议的任务”的报告。代表们在发言中表示完全赞同并一致通过了托·雅科瓦的报告。代表们表示将和全国人民一起坚决贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的决议和霍查同志二月六日的报告中提出的革命化措施，实现工人阶级的思想革命化。
    在大会期间，应邀出席大会的二十八个外国工会代表团在会上致了贺词。许多代表在贺词中盛赞在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级和人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的辉煌成就，热情歌颂毛主席和战无不胜的毛泽东思想，表示坚决走毛泽东的道路，进行反对帝国主义、反对新老殖民主义的武装斗争。
