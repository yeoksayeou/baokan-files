U.S. Imperialism Out of Okinawa!

150,000 Workers, Peasants, and Students in Okinawa Hold Rally and Demonstration

The Asian-African Solidarity Council of China Resolutely Supports the Japanese People's Anti-Imperialist, Patriotic Struggle

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: On the evening of April 28, 150,000 workers, peasants, and students in Okinawa held a rally in Naha to commemorate "Okinawa Day," demanding that the U.S. government return Okinawa to Japan.

	The crowd at the rally expressed strong indignation at the U.S. imperialists' transformation of Okinawa into a base for invading Vietnam and their brutal oppression of the Okinawan people.

	After the rally, the participants braved the heavy rain to march through the main streets of Naha in a demonstration that lasted until late at night. The demonstrators shouted slogans such as: "Immediately and unconditionally return Okinawa to Japan!" "U.S. military bases out of Okinawa!" "Oppose the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam!"

	On the same day, about 500 representatives from Okinawa and the Japanese mainland held a rally on the sea surface at the 27th parallel north, demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Tokyo: On the evening of April 27, activists from the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council of Japan, the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers, and the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) held a rally in Tokyo to demand the return of Okinawa. They passed a resolution calling on the Japanese people to unite and drive the U.S. imperialists out of Okinawa, and to fight for Japan's complete independence.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report, on April 25, the Asian-African Solidarity Council of China sent a telegram to the Asian-African People's Solidarity Council of Japan on the occasion of April 28, "Okinawa Day." The telegram expressed high respect to Japanese comrades who are fighting under the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism and Asian-African solidarity, and to the indomitable Japanese people who are bravely fighting against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. It resolutely supports the Japanese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism.

	The telegram warmly praised the Japanese people for achieving one great victory after another in their long struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, especially their heroic struggle to recover Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands and their struggle against U.S. military bases. These struggles have repeatedly dealt heavy blows to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and made important contributions to the defense of peace in Asia and the world. The telegram strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for actively serving as the No. 1 running dog of U.S. imperialism, vigorously peddling the "peace talks" scam to sell out the interests of the Vietnamese people, and sabotaging the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. In Japan, the Soviet revisionists colluded with the Japanese Communist Party revisionists and conspired with the Japanese reactionaries to frenziedly carry out anti-China activities, sabotaging the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan.

	The telegram pointed out that all this fully shows that they are in their death throes, exposing their paper tiger nature. Their plots will never succeed. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! All the peoples of the world, be courageous and dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and press on wave upon wave. Then the whole world will definitely be the world of the people. All devils will be thoroughly wiped out."

	The telegram said, we will always resolutely support the Japanese people's just struggle against U.S. imperialism. We are firmly convinced that the final victory will belong to the heroic Japanese people, and a completely independent new Japan will definitely be realized.

    美帝国主义从冲绳滚出去
    冲绳十五万工人农民学生集会示威
    我亚非团结会坚决支持日本人民反美爱国斗争
    据新华社讯　东京消息：十五万冲绳工人、农民和学生在“冲绳日”——四月二十八日傍晚在那坝市举行动员大会，要求美国政府把冲绳归还给日本。
    到会的群众对美帝国主义把冲绳变为侵越基地和残酷压迫冲绳人民的罪行表示强烈愤怒。
    会后，与会者冒着大雨在那坝的主要街道举行示威游行，直至深夜。示威群众高呼口号：“立即无条件地把冲绳归还日本！”“美国军事基地撤出冲绳！”“反对美帝国主义侵略越南的战争！”
    同一天，来自冲绳和日本本土的代表约五百人，在北纬二十七度线的海面上举行集会，要求把冲绳归还日本。
    据新华社讯　东京消息：亚非人民团结日本委员会、日本记者同盟、日中友好协会（正统）总部的积极分子四月二十七日晚，在东京举行了要求归还冲绳的集会，并通过决议号召日本人民团结起来，把美帝国主义从冲绳赶出去，为争取日本的完全独立而斗争。
    据新华社讯　中国亚非团结委员会四月二十五日为四月二十八“冲绳日”致电亚非人民团结日本委员会，向高举反帝反修和亚非团结旗帜坚持奋斗的日本战友们，向不屈不挠地同美日反动派进行英勇斗争的兄弟的日本人民，致以崇高的敬意，坚决支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。
    电报热烈赞扬日本人民在同美日反动派进行长期的斗争中，取得了一个又一个伟大的胜利，特别是为了收复冲绳和小笠原，为了反对美国军事基地展开的英勇斗争，都不断给予美日反动派以沉重打击，为保卫亚洲和世界和平做出重要贡献。电报强烈谴责苏修集团积极充当美帝头号帮凶，大力推销出卖越南人民利益的“和谈”骗局，破坏各国人民的反帝革命斗争。在日本，苏修又勾结日共修正主义分子，和日本反动派串通一气，疯狂进行反华活动，破坏中日两国人民的战斗友谊。
    电报指出，所有这些，都充分表明它们在进行垂死的挣扎，暴露出它们虚弱的纸老虎本质，他们的阴谋活动是绝不会得逞的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    电报说，我们始终不渝地坚决支持日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争。我们坚信，最后的胜利一定属于英雄的日本人民，一个完全独立的新日本必将实现。
