	The Living Example of "Red Capitalists"

	Due to the policy of opening the door to foreign capital by the Soviet revisionist leading clique, the imperialist monopoly capital headed by the United States is rushing in to invest in the Soviet Union.

	The reason why imperialist monopoly capital is so eager to enter the Soviet Union is for two purposes. One is to export capital, exploit the Soviet people, and gain huge profits; the other is to use this economic infiltration to further promote the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union, thereby completely restoring capitalism. These two purposes are not even hidden by the likes of Johnson. The so-called "bridges" built by Johnson and his ilk are exactly this kind of bridge that serves both the economic interests of U.S. imperialism and its broad political purposes.

	The actions of the Soviet revisionist leading clique in opening the door to thieves show that this group of people are not only actively serving imperialism as slaves internationally but also are compradors who sell out national interests to imperialism.

	The biggest capitalist-roaders in power within the Chinese Communist Party, don't they say that communists can also act as "red capitalists"? What is a "red capitalist"? Brezhnev, Kosygin, and those who use the Communist Party as a cover to act as agents of imperialism are living examples. "Red" is a deception; "capitalist," however, is genuine.

	The Soviet revisionist leading clique relies on the "cooperation" of imperialist monopoly capital to build "communism," which is nothing more than following in the footsteps of the Tito clique. Didn't the Tito clique long ago advocate the so-called "road" of building "socialism" with the help of American aid? Now people can clearly see that this road is one that changes the socialist system into a capitalist system according to the needs of imperialism, making Yugoslavia a vassal of imperialism. The "road" of the Soviet revisionist leading clique to build "communism" with the help of foreign capital cannot be anything else; it is only a road that, according to the needs of U.S. imperialism, completely restores capitalism in the Soviet Union and incorporates the Soviet Union into the "free world family" of U.S. imperialism.

	The Soviet revisionist traitor clique opens the door wide to foreign monopoly capital, which is absolutely intolerable to the great Soviet people. The actions of this group of national traitors will only accelerate their own downfall.

    “红色买办”的活标本
    由于苏修领导集团向外国资本实行门户开放政策，以美国为首的帝国主义垄断资本正在竞相打进苏联，大搞投资活动。
    帝国主义垄断资本之所以对苏联趋之若鹜，不外乎出于两个目的。一个是输出资本，剥削苏联人民，谋取巨额利润；另外一个是通过这种经济渗透，进一步促使苏联“和平演变”，彻底实现资本主义复辟。这两个目的，是连美帝国主义的头目也并不隐讳的。约翰逊之流的所谓“搭桥”，搭的就是这样一种既符合美帝“经济利益”，也符合它的“广泛的政治目的”的桥。
    苏修领导集团这种开门揖盗的行径，表明他们这一伙，不仅在国际上是积极为帝国主义效劳的奴仆，而且是向帝国主义出卖民族利益的买办。
    中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，不是说什么共产党人也可以充当“红色买办”吗？什么叫“红色买办”？勃列日?夫、柯西金这样一些打着共产党招牌的帝国主义代理人，就是活标本。“红色”，那是骗人的；买办，却是货真价实。
    苏修领导集团依靠帝国主义垄断资本的“合作”来建设“共产主义”，这不过是步铁托集团的后尘。铁托集团不早就宣扬所谓依靠美援建设“社会主义”的“道路”吗？现在人们都可以看得清楚，这条道路，就是按照帝国主义的需要，把社会主义制度改变为资本主义制度的道路，就是使南斯拉夫变为帝国主义附庸的道路。苏修领导集团依靠外国资本建设“共产主义”的“道路”也不可能是别的，只不过是按照美帝国主义的需要，在苏联彻底复辟资本主义，把苏联纳入美帝国主义的“自由世界大家庭”的道路罢了。
    苏修叛徒集团，向外国垄断资本大开门户，这是伟大的苏联人民所绝对不能容忍的。苏修集团这一伙民族败类这样倒行逆施，只会加速他们自己的灭亡。
