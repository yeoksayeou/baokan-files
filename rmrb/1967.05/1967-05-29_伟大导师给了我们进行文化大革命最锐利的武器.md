Billions of revolutionary masses enthusiastically acclaim the publication of Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art
The great teacher has given us the sharpest weapon for the Cultural Revolution
Study them earnestly, carry them out resolutely, and direct the spearhead of struggle at the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, pushing the revolutionary criticism to new heights
New China News Agency, May 28th: The billions of revolutionary masses across the country are enthusiastically acclaiming the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents on literature and art. They unanimously point out that these five documents creatively develop Marxism-Leninism's literary theory, creatively develop Marxism-Leninism's theory on class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, serving as a compass for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie and other exploiting classes' ideology, develop socialist literature and art, prevent revisionist elements from usurping the party and the state, and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. These documents are the programmatic and great documents of the proletarian cultural revolution.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Shanxi, Guizhou, and Heilongjiang provinces and municipalities immediately launched a heated study and discussion after seeing Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art in the newspapers. They unanimously pointed out that the publication of Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art is a great joy for all of China and the world. These five documents are our strongest and sharpest weapons in our struggle against the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, and in our struggle against all bourgeois ideology. We must study them earnestly and carry them out resolutely, applying them to the current class struggle to achieve new victories in the proletarian cultural revolution and new victories in struggle-criticism-transformation.

A member of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and a female worker from the No. 126 Textile Mill, Xie Yue, said: Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, there still exists a sharp struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's counter-restoration. For a long time, a counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line has permeated the literary and art circles, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, opposing the great Mao Zedong Thought, and peddling feudalist and capitalist goods. This is because the power over the literary and art front has been usurped by the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique and a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists under their protection, turning literature and art into a frontline battlefield for overthrowing proletarian dictatorship and restoring capitalism. We must seize back the power over literature and art into the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries to implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, making literature and art truly serve to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We workers and peasants must take up the sharp weapon given to us by Chairman Mao, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism high, thoroughly criticize the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, thoroughly criticize all bourgeois ideology, pull down all counter-revolutionary "big shots," make them stand aside, and seize back the power they have usurped to ensure that the proletarian iron mountain and river last forever and never change color!

The deputy head of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai No. 17 Cotton Mill, Tang Wenlan, said: In the 17 years since the founding of the nation, the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique has supported a group of counter-revolutionary revisionists, using drama, film, novels, and other means to create public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art, the proletarian revolutionary fighters on the literary and art front have engaged in fierce struggles with a small clique of revisionists. This is a struggle to smash the plot of capitalist restoration, a struggle to uproot revisionism from the ideological realm and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. This struggle has already achieved decisive victories. She said: Chairman Mao's five documents are great truths, applicable not only to the cultural realm but also to all realms. The publication of these five brilliant documents provides a powerful ideological weapon for the current movement of criticizing the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, pushing this movement of criticism to a deeper stage. We must strive to study these five documents and, following the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, closely combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle-criticism-transformation of our units, carrying the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

The broad masses of workers, peasants, revolutionary youth, and revolutionary cadres in various places emphasized in their discussions on study experiences that we must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, elevating the class struggle on the literary and art front and the struggle between the two lines in the ideological realm to the level of the power issue. Ignoring this point is equivalent to forgetting proletarian dictatorship. We must not only use the gun to defend proletarian dictatorship but also use the pen to defend proletarian dictatorship. We must combine the struggle to seize power from the party's small anti-revolutionary revisionist clique with the struggle to seize power from our own minds, constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, forever remaining steadfast proletarian revolutionary fighters. A responsible person from the preparatory committee of the Harbin Workers' Congress said: The counter-revolutionary revisionists supported by the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique attempted to turn the literary and art front into their battlefield for capitalist restoration. In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we workers, peasants, and revolutionary youth have exposed this group of counter-revolutionary "big shots," which is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The large number of facts exposed in the cultural revolution fully illustrate how sharp the class struggle is! We, the working class, must not only strive to produce and build socialism but also take up the pen to defend proletarian dictatorship. The revolutionary youth of Shandong Lu Xun University said: The party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique attempted to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism, first using the pen to attack us. We must never overlook the role of the pen. Using the pen to struggle is not just a matter of pen and ink but is also a life-and-death class struggle of seizing and counter-seizing power. The struggles in the literary and art circles in the 17 years since the founding of the nation have all revolved around the issue of power, and at every critical moment in the struggle, Chairman Mao has issued great directives, which are the fundamental guarantee for the proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie. The revolutionary literary and art workers of the Guizhou Provincial Drama Troupe said: After studying Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents, we deeply feel that literature and art should become weapons to defend proletarian dictatorship, and literary and art workers are the singers and defenders of the proletarian iron mountain and river. We revolutionary literary and art workers must firmly remember that the revolutionary literary and art troops are an army serving political struggle and proletarian dictatorship. We must actively engage in the struggles of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, actively participate in social class struggles, and through literary and art performances, play a combat role in "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

The Red Guards and revolutionary students of Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and the Beijing Drama School expressed that they will better study and apply Chairman Mao's five great directives, carrying the struggle between the two lines on the literary and art front through to the end, launching a fierce attack on the party's small anti-revolutionary revisionist clique and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities," pushing the movement of revolutionary criticism to new heights, and fighting to the end to defend proletarian dictatorship!

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries across the country said: Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the proletarian cultural revolution, finally exposing a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists, exposing the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique as the mastermind behind them. This is a historical verdict, a great victory for the proletarian revolutionaries over the party's bourgeois agents! They expressed that they must, through mass movements, use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to carry out the struggle of destruction and construction. Only by implementing great democracy under proletarian dictatorship can we truly destroy and construct, truly carry out destruction and construction. They said: Those counter-revolutionary "big shots" seem to be "giants" on the surface, acting arrogantly and invincibly, as if no one can touch them. But they are paper tigers, strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and cannot withstand a blow. The proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought fear neither heaven nor earth, nor gods nor ghosts, pulling down all those invincible counter-revolutionary "big shots"! Burying all decayed things that go against the tide of the times! The revolutionary "little people" will definitely be able to overthrow "big shots" like Khrushchev in China, and the history of the literary and art circles that has been overturned will be overturned again by us proletarian revolutionaries.

The broad masses of soldiers and cultural workers in the People's Liberation Army, who are responsible for the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting the workers, supporting the peasants, military control, military training, and war preparedness and production, enthusiastically acclaim the publication of our great leader Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents on literature and art. In recent days, the broad masses of soldiers and cultural workers in the army, navy, and air force have held celebration meetings and symposiums, expressing their determination to earnestly study and apply Chairman Mao's five great documents on literature and art to defend proletarian dictatorship. The broad masses of soldiers said: Chairman Mao's five documents on literature and art are like an alarm bell reminding us: Never forget class struggle, especially be vigilant against those enemies who do not carry guns, using various despicable tricks to corrupt us ideologically, aiming to usurp our proletarian power. We soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must closely watch the struggles between the two classes, two roads, and two lines on the literary and art front, swearing to defend proletarian dictatorship with new achievements. A member of the Shanxi Revolutionary Committee and the leader of the "Xie Qin Class," Xie Qi, said: "In the midst of the proletarian cultural revolution that shakes the world, the publication of Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents is like sending the sharpest ideological weapon to us fighters on the frontlines of supporting the left, supporting the workers, and supporting the peasants. With the great Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, with the revolutionary army united under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and with these five brilliant works as our weapons, any stubborn reactionary fortresses and any seemingly powerful enemies will be smashed by us." The "Iron Soldier" of the Railway Corps, Zhang Chunyu, said: We, the People's Liberation Army, are the people's army created by Chairman Mao, the pillar of proletarian dictatorship. We have seized the power in the past with both the gun and the pen, and in the future, we will also seize the power with both. We will not only use the gun but also take up the pen to struggle to defend and consolidate proletarian dictatorship. The commander of a certain regiment in the Heilongjiang garrison, Ding Xueming, said: Chairman Mao's five great documents on literature and art have given us new combat tasks. We enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call, while firmly holding the gun to defend proletarian dictatorship, we also firmly hold the pen, with the same combat posture as we did on the battlefield to charge against the enemy, launching a great criticism and struggle against the party's top anti-revolutionary revisionist clique, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary black line he promoted, and letting the great red flag of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line fly high on the proletarian literary and art front.

    亿万革命群众欢呼毛主席关于文艺的五个文件公开发表
    伟大导师给了我们进行文化大革命最锐利的武器
    认真学习，坚决照办，把斗争矛头对准党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，把革命大批判推向新高潮
    新华社二十八日讯　全国亿万革命群众最热烈地欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席关于文艺的五个光辉文件的公开发表。他们纷纷指出，这五个文件，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的文艺理论，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说，是无产阶级战胜资产阶级和其他剥削阶级意识形态，发展社会主义文学艺术，防止修正主义分子篡党篡政，巩固无产阶级专政的指南针，是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性的伟大的文献。
    北京、上海、山东、山西、贵州和黑龙江等省市的广大工农兵群众，在报纸上看到了毛主席关于文艺的五个文件之后，立即热烈地展开了学习讨论。他们一致指出，毛主席关于文艺的五个文件的公开发表，是全中国和全世界的大喜事。这五个文件，是我们向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争的最强大最锐利的武器，是我们向一切剥削阶级意识形态作斗争的最强大最锐利的武器。我们一定认真学习，坚决照办，把它运用到当前阶级斗争中去，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利，夺取斗批改的新胜利。
    山西省革命委员会常委、一·二六纺织厂细纱女工解悦说：在无产阶级专政条件下，仍然存在着资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的尖锐斗争。长期以来，在文艺界贯穿了一条反革命修正主义文艺黑线，疯狂地对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，对抗伟大的毛泽东思想，大肆贩卖封建主义、资本主义黑货，就是因为文艺阵地的权被党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他庇护下的一小撮反革命修正主义分子所篡夺，把文艺作为颠覆无产阶级专政、实现资本主义复辟的前沿阵地。我们只有把文艺大权夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，才能贯彻毛主席的革命文艺路线，才能使文艺真正为巩固无产阶级专政服务，为工农兵服务。我们工农兵群众一定要拿起毛主席交给我们的锐利武器，高举革命的批判大旗，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底批臭一切剥削阶级意识形态，把反革命的“大人物”统统拉下马，叫他们靠边站，把他们篡夺的权统统夺回来，保障无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代，永不变色！上海国棉十七厂革命委员会副主任唐文兰说：建国十七年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持一批反革命修正主义分子，利用戏剧、电影、小说等，为他们复辟资本主义制造舆论。在毛主席的关于文艺的五个文件的光辉思想照耀下，文艺战线上的无产阶级革命派战士，同一小撮修正主义分子进行了激烈的斗争。这是粉碎资本主义复辟阴谋的斗争，是从思想上挖掉修正主义根子，巩固无产阶级专政的斗争。这场斗争目前已经取得了决定性的胜利。她说：毛主席的这五个文件，是伟大的真理，不仅适用于文化领域，也适用于各个领域。这五个光辉文件的发表，为当前开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动提供了强大的思想武器，把这场大批判运动推向了一个更加深入的阶段。我们一定要努力学习这五个文件，沿着毛主席指引的方向，把革命的大批判与本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    各地广大工农兵、革命小将、革命干部在谈到学习体会时强调指出，我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，把文艺战线上的阶级斗争，把意识形态领域里两条路线的斗争，提高到政权问题上来认识。忽视这一点，就等于忘记了无产阶级专政。我们不但要用枪杆子保卫无产阶级专政，还要用笔杆子保卫无产阶级专政。我们要把向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的夺权斗争，同自己头脑中的夺权斗争结合起来，不断地用毛泽东思想克服各种非无产阶级思想，永远做坚定的无产阶级革命战士。哈尔滨工代会筹委会负责人说，为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派支持的反革命修正主义分子，妄图把文艺战线变成他们复辟资本主义的阵地。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们工农兵和革命小将，把这批反革命的“大人物”揪了出来，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。文化大革命中揭露出来的大量事实，充分说明阶级斗争是多么尖锐！我们工人阶级不仅要努力生产，建设社会主义，而且要拿起笔杆子，保卫无产阶级专政。山东鲁迅大学的革命小将们说：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派妄图推翻无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义，首先就是用笔杆子向我们进攻的。我们万万不可忽视笔杆子的作用。用笔杆子进行斗争绝不是打笔墨官司，而同样是夺权和反夺权的你死我活的阶级斗争。建国十七年来文艺界的斗争，都是围绕政权这个问题进行的，在斗争的每个关键时刻，毛主席都作出了伟大的指示，这是无产阶级战胜资产阶级的根本保证。贵州省话剧团的革命文艺工作者说：学习了毛主席的五个光辉文献后，我们体会最深的是：文艺应该成为保卫无产阶级专政的武器，文艺工作者就是无产阶级铁打江山的歌颂者和保卫者。我们革命文艺工作者一定要牢牢记住，革命文艺队伍是一支为政治斗争为无产阶级专政服务的军队。积极投身到工农兵群众中去，积极参加社会上的阶级斗争，同时通过文艺演出，起到“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的战斗作用。
    北京大学、北京师范大学和北京戏剧专科学校的红卫兵和革命师生们表示，一定更好地活学活用毛主席这五个伟大指示，把文艺战线上的两条路线的斗争进行到底，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”发起猛烈的进攻，把革命的大批判运动推向新高潮，为保卫无产阶级专政而战斗到底！
    各地广大的无产阶级革命派说：毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，终于把一小撮反革命修正主义分子揭露出来了，把这批反革命修正主义的总后台、党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来了。这是历史的鉴定，这是无产阶级革命派战胜党内资产阶级代理人的伟大胜利！他们表示：一定要通过群众运动，用毛泽东思想这个锐利武器，进行大破大立的斗争。只有实行无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，才能彻底的破，真正的立，才能大破大立。他们说：那些反革命的“大人物”，表面看来似乎是“庞然大物”，装腔作势，不可一世，好象谁也动不得。但他们是外强中干、不堪一击的纸老虎。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派天不怕，地不怕，神不怕，鬼不怕，把这些不可一世的反革命“大人物”统统拉下马！把一切逆乎时代潮流的腐朽事物彻底埋葬！革命的“小人物”一定能够打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫那样的“大人物”，文艺界被颠倒了的历史必将由我们无产阶级革命派再颠倒过来。
    担负着支左、支工、支农、军管、军训和战备、生产等光荣任务的人民解放军广大指战员和部队革命文艺工作者，热烈欢呼我们伟大领袖毛主席关于文艺的五个光辉文件的公开发表。连日来，陆海空三军广大指战员和部队文艺工作者纷纷举行庆祝会、座谈会，表示一定要认真活学活用毛主席关于文艺的五个伟大文件，保卫无产阶级专政。广大指战员们说，毛主席关于文艺的五个文件，象警钟一样提醒我们：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，特别要警惕那些不拿枪的敌人，使用种种卑鄙伎俩，妄图从思想上腐蚀我们，以达到篡夺我们无产阶级政权的目的。我们解放军战士，要密切注视文艺战线上的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，誓为保卫无产阶级专政立新功。山西省革命委员会委员、“谢臣班”班长谢起说：“在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命凯歌声中，公开发表毛主席的这五个光辉文件，这是给我们战斗在支左、支工、支农前线的战士们，送来了最锐利的思想武器。我们有伟大的毛泽东思想作指南，有在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下团结起来的革命大军，又有了这五篇光辉著作作武器，任何顽固的反动堡垒，任何貌似强大的敌人，都将被我们摧垮。“铁道兵硬骨头战士”张春玉说：我们人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造的人民军队，是无产阶级专政的柱石。我们过去靠枪杆子、笔杆子夺取了印把子，今后，我们也要靠这两杆子掌好印把子。我们不仅要用枪杆子，而且要拿起笔杆子，为保卫和巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。黑龙江驻军某部团长丁学明说：毛主席关于文艺的五个伟大文件，向我们提出了新的战斗任务，我们热烈地响应毛主席的号召，在紧握枪杆子保卫无产阶级专政的同时，紧握笔杆子，以当年在战场上向拿枪的敌人冲杀的战斗姿态，展开对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，彻底摧毁他推行的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，让伟大领袖毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大红旗，高高飘扬在无产阶级文艺阵地上。
