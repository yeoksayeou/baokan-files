The Palestinian people are increasingly recognizing the great significance of the revolutionary experience of the Chinese people; they are increasingly deeply aware of the great significance of the power of Mao Zedong Thought. Once the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they can create miracles, move mountains, and change the face of the world.

Mao Zedong Thought is the great genius summary of the revolutionary practice of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the whole world. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism that the Chinese people have creatively developed in their great struggle against imperialism, colonialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries; it is the sole highest directive for the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the Chinese people; it is the powerful weapon of the Chinese people in their struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. In a word, Mao Zedong Thought is the highest stage of the development of Marxism-Leninism in our era, the highest peak of living, developed Marxism-Leninism.

"All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrible, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." This is the judgment of the great leader of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the whole world, Chairman Mao. Under the inspiration of this profound judgment, the people of the whole world dare to engage in a heroic struggle against the most ferocious enemy in human history—the U.S. imperialism that has done so much evil in Vietnam, Palestine, the Congo (Kinshasa), and the Dominican Republic.

For over fifty years, the Palestinian people have been waging various kinds of glorious and heroic struggles to liberate their homeland from British imperialist occupation. In our history, we have written the most glorious chapter. Our small country experienced a nationwide strike that lasted six months during the British occupation in 1936. After that, there were continuous uprisings and revolutions. When imperialism established the base of Zionism, the tame tool of U.S. imperialism, the so-called Israel, in the heart of our homeland, our people rose up in resistance. In the struggle for freedom, we have shed blood. Now we are still fighting, and our situation is rarely seen anywhere in the world. Imperialism and its lackeys, and the reactionaries of various countries, have carried out all kinds of shameful conspiracies against our people. In the long struggle, our people have suffered many defeats. Similarly, any ideology that guided our people to victory has not achieved the expected results.

In the vast sea of struggle, our people looked around the surrounding continents to find a glimmer of hope to guide them to victory. Suddenly, we saw the dawn in the distant east. We found the great truth of the revolutionary people, found the brilliant ideology that guided China out of the sea of slavery to the shore of freedom, found the precious ideal—this is Mao Zedong Thought.

Of course, when our people found the road to freedom and liberation—the road of Mao Zedong Thought, the western imperialist lords and the Moscow revisionist lords will not approve, because they think that there is a danger in the great Mao Zedong Thought that threatens their interests and their existence. Therefore, they do not hesitate to spend dollars, pounds, rubles, and francs, attempting to make the wheels of history roll backward. However, the wheels of history roll forward, and the light of Mao Zedong Thought shines all over the world.

Our homeland, Palestine, is occupied and divided, just as the imperialist powers once divided China into spheres of influence. Mao Zedong Thought unified China and liberated China from imperialist slavery and darkness. How much we need Mao Zedong Thought! We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought to liberate our country and get rid of colonialism, darkness, and slavery. We firmly believe that only Mao Zedong Thought can save our homeland; without Mao Zedong Thought, we will never achieve victory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever is reactionary, you must overthrow it." He also says: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, and surmount every difficulty to win victory."

Chairman Mao's teachings are a great inspiration for the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and all reactionaries! Chairman Mao's teachings are the powerful ideological weapons for smashing the old world and building a new world. Chairman Mao also inspires us, saying, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." Chairman Mao's teaching is the sharpest weapon for every revolutionary to oppose U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao also points out: "Revisionism, or right opportunism, is a bourgeois ideology. It is more dangerous than dogmatism. Revisionists and right opportunists also hang Marxism on their lips. They also attack 'dogmatism.' But what they attack is the most fundamental thing in Marxism." The Soviet revisionist clique is the sworn enemy of our people, the Chinese people, and the revolutionary people of the world. It is they who, together with U.S. imperialism, inserted the poisonous dagger of so-called Israel into the heart of Arab Palestine; it is they who support Israel and encourage Zionists to immigrate to Palestine.

The Palestinian people have learned from numerous defeats that only Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can save them from the abyss. Therefore, the Palestinian Arab people scattered throughout the Arab countries have begun to strive to study the works of Chairman Mao. In Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, and Palestinian refugee camps, our Palestinian Arab people have begun to study Chairman Mao's works individually or collectively. Despite various obstacles, they have obtained wisdom from this clear spring of Mao Zedong's works. At the same time, the Palestinian Liberation Army in the Gaza Strip has begun to earnestly and enthusiastically study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Their purpose of study is to liberate the homeland and to learn how to fight against Zionism and old and new colonialism. Moreover, among the Palestinian people in Jordan, there are many who, fearing neither repression nor white terror, neither imprisonment nor torture, nor even beheading, risk their lives to carry Mao Zedong's works with them.

We, the Palestinian Arab people, have been driven out of our homes for eighteen years. Some say these eighteen years are years of poverty. But we say these eighteen years are years of plenty, because in these eighteen years, we Palestinian people have learned so much! We have waged so many struggles! These eighteen years have given us so many precious experiences! We have learned to distinguish who is the enemy and who is the friend. We have understood Chairman Mao's teaching: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle."

Now, imperialism and modern revisionism are extremely hostile to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently underway in China, launching vicious attacks and describing this great revolution as "very disturbing." But we fully support this revolution. We say this revolution is very good. Because it thoroughly uproots the social basis for the growth of revisionism and prevents the restoration of capitalism in China. The complete victory of this revolution will pave the way for the transition to a communist society. It is not surprising that imperialists and revisionists are so frantically attacking Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. It is Chairman Mao who has defended Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary cause of the proletariat; it is Chairman Mao who has raised high the banner of revolution against imperialism and modern revisionism that has betrayed Marxism-Leninism.

We, the Palestinian people, who are suffering from the oppression, slavery, and exploitation of imperialism and Zionism, now have a deeper understanding of the great guiding role of Mao Zedong Thought; especially the great thought of Chairman Mao on people's war. At a time when Marxism-Leninism is being trampled upon, when the revolutionary cause of the proletariat is facing destruction, when the national liberation struggles of various countries are being brutally suppressed by imperialism, when our country is facing the shameful betrayal caused by the treachery of the Soviet modern revisionist clique, Chairman Mao firmly leads the world revolution to victory. This is our fortune, and it is the fortune of all the people of the world. It is Chairman Mao who has defended Marxism-Leninism and saved the international communist movement. Without Chairman Mao's wise leadership, red China would have become black or white China, and the people of the world would have lost the most reliable base in their liberation cause. Now that China has nuclear weapons and an unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the oppressed people of the world have these two powerful weapons, both material and spiritual, and can defeat all enemies.

Chairman Mao is the red sun that never sets in our hearts, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for all humanity!

    毛泽东思想是巴勒斯坦人民的指南
    巴勒斯坦　塞米尔·哈克姆
    巴勒斯坦人民越来越清楚地认识到中国人民革命经验的伟大意义；越来越深刻地意识到毛泽东思想的威力的伟大意义。人民群众一旦掌握了毛泽东思想，就能够创造出奇迹，就能够移山倒海，改变世界的面貌。
    毛泽东思想是中国人民和全世界革命人民革命实践经验的伟大的天才总结。毛泽东思想是中国人民进行的反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义、反对现代修正主义和各国反动派的伟大斗争中创造性地发展了的马克思主义；是中国人民社会主义革命和社会主义建设的唯一的最高指示；是中国人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大武器。一句话，毛泽东思想是马列主义在我们当代发展的最高阶段，是活的发展了的马列主义的最高峰。
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”这是中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的论断。在这一英明论断的鼓舞下，全世界人民敢于同人类历史上最凶恶的敌人——在越南、巴勒斯坦、刚果（金）和多米尼加干尽了坏事的美帝国主义作英勇的斗争。
    我们巴勒斯坦人民为了从英帝国主义霸占下解放自己的祖国，已经进行了五十多年的各种各样的光荣的英勇斗争，在我们的历史上写下了最光辉的一页。我们小小的国家，在一九三六年英国占领时期就发生过长达六个月的全国罢工。在这之后，就连续不断地发生了起义和革命。当帝国主义把犹太复国主义的基地、美帝国主义的驯服工具、所谓的以色列插在我们祖国的心脏时，我们人民就奋起反抗。在为自由而战中，我们付出了鲜血。现在我们仍然在战斗，我们的处境在世界上任何地方都是少有的。帝国主义及其走狗和各国形形色色的反动派对我国人民进行了种种最可耻的阴谋。在漫长的斗争中，我国人民多次失败。同样，任何指导我国人民走向胜利的思想也未能达到预期效果。
    我国人民在斗争的大海中遥望四周的大陆，来寻找指导他们走向胜利的一线希望。忽然，我们在遥远的东方，看到了黎明的曙光，我们找到了革命人民的伟大真理，找到了指导中国摆脱奴役苦海走向自由彼岸的光辉思想，找到了珍贵的理想，这就是毛泽东思想。
    当然，我国人民找到了自由和解放的道路——毛泽东思想的道路，西方帝国主义老爷们和莫斯科修正主义老爷们，是不会赞赏的，因为他们认为在伟大的毛泽东思想中存在着一种危险，威胁着他们的利益和他们的生存。于是，他们不惜美元、英镑、卢布和法郎，妄图使历史的车轮倒退。但是，历史的车轮滚滚向前，毛泽东思想的光芒四射，普照全球。
    我们的祖国巴勒斯坦被占领，被分割，就象过去帝国主义列强在旧中国瓜分势力范围那样。毛泽东思想统一了中国，从帝国主义奴役下和黑暗中解放了中国。我们多么需要毛泽东思想啊！我们一定要用毛泽东思想来武装自己，解放我们的国家，摆脱殖民主义、黑暗和奴役。我们坚信，只有毛泽东思想能够拯救我们的祖国；没有毛泽东思想，我们就永远也不能获得胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”还说：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    毛主席的这些教导，对反对帝国主义、殖民主义和一切反动派的斗争是多大的鼓舞啊！毛主席的教导，是我们砸烂旧世界，建设新世界的强大的思想武器。毛主席还鼓舞我们说，“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”毛主席的这一教导是每一个革命者反对美帝国主义的最锐利的武器。毛主席还指出：“修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”苏联修正主义集团是我国人民、中国人民和世界革命人民的不共戴天的仇敌。是它伙同美帝国主义，把所谓的以色列这把有毒的匕首插进了阿拉伯巴勒斯坦的心脏；是它支持以色列，并鼓励犹太复国主义者迁居到巴勒斯坦。
    巴勒斯坦人民从多次的失败中认识到：只有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想才能够从深渊解救他们自己。所以，我们遍布于阿拉伯各国的巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民已经开始努力学习毛泽东主席的著作。在叙利亚、黎巴嫩、伊拉克、科威特、阿尔及利亚、巴勒斯坦难民营里，我们巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民已经开始单独或集体学习毛主席的著作。尽管有种种障碍，他们还是从毛泽东著作这个清澈的泉源里得到了智慧。同时，在加沙地区的巴勒斯坦解放军已开始努力而热情地活学活用毛主席著作。他们学习的目的就是为了解放祖国、为了学会怎样同犹太复国主义和新老殖民主义打仗。另外，在约旦的巴勒斯坦人民中有很多人他们不怕镇压、不怕白色恐怖，不怕坐牢、受刑，甚至杀头，冒着生命的危险，随身携带着毛泽东主席的著作。
    我们巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民被赶出家园已经十八年了。有的人说，这十八年是贫穷的十八年。但是我们说，这十八年是丰满的十八年，因为在这十八年里，我们巴勒斯坦人民学到了多少东西啊！我们进行了多少次斗争啊！这十八年给了我们多少宝贵的经验啊！我们学会了辨别谁是敌人，谁是朋友。我们懂得了毛主席的这一教导：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    现在，帝国主义、现代修正主义对当前正在中国开展的这场无产阶级文化大革命无比仇恨，进行恶毒的攻击，把这个伟大的革命说成什么“非常令人不安”。而我们则完全支持这个大革命，我们说，这个革命好得很。因为它彻底挖掉了滋长修正主义的社会基础，防止资本主义在中国的复辟。这个革命的全面胜利将为过渡到共产主义社会铺平道路。帝国主义者和修正主义者这样疯狂地攻击毛主席和毛泽东思想，这是毫不奇怪的。是毛主席捍卫了马克思列宁主义，捍卫了无产阶级的革命事业；是毛主席把反对帝国主义和反对背叛了马列主义的现代修正主义的革命旗帜高高举起。
    正遭受着帝国主义和犹太复国主义的压迫、奴役以及剥削的我们巴勒斯坦人民，现在更深刻地认识到毛泽东思想的伟大指导作用；特别是认识到了毛泽东主席关于人民战争的伟大思想。在马列主义遭到糟踏的时候，在无产阶级革命事业面临被破坏的时候，在各国民族解放斗争遭到帝国主义血腥镇压的时候，在我国面临着由于苏联现代修正主义集团的背叛而造成的可耻的被出卖的时候，毛泽东主席坚定地领导着世界革命胜利前进，这是我们的幸运，也是全世界人民的幸运。是毛主席捍卫了马列主义，拯救了国际共产主义运动，没有毛主席的英明领导，红色的中国就会变成黑色的或白色的中国，世界人民在解放事业中也就将失去最可靠的基地。现在中国有了核武器，有了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，全世界被压迫人民就有了物质与精神的这两种强大武器，就能战胜一切敌人。
    毛泽东主席是我们心中不落的红太阳，毛泽东思想是全人类的指路明灯！
