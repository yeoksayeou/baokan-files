The Palestinian military and civilians in the Gaza region, after several days of activities commemorating the 19th anniversary of the occupation of Palestine, have shifted to intense war preparations. They are ready to severely punish the Zionists backed by U.S. imperialism if Israel attacks Syria, and to begin a sacred war to liberate Palestine. According to reports from local newspapers today, the Palestinian National Liberation Army has moved to frontline positions near Israel.

Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Shukeiri strongly condemned the recent preparations by U.S. imperialism and Israel to launch new military provocations against Palestine and Arab countries in a speech at a mass rally of 25,000 people in Rafah on the 17th. He said, "If the United States and Israel dare to launch a new aggression, we will defeat them." Shukeiri said that tens of thousands of Palestinian workers, farmers, and youth have recently joined the civil defense forces or the people's resistance army. Armed and fearless of sacrifice, they are determined to eliminate the aggressors and liberate their homes that have been forcibly taken.

In his speech, Shukeiri enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Palestinian peoples. At this moment, the audience enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong! Long live China! Welcome Beijing! Welcome revolutionaries!"

Chinese Ambassador to the United Arab Republic Huang Hua, who was invited to participate in the commemorative activities in the Gaza region, was warmly received when he spoke at the rally. In his speech, he expressed heartfelt thanks to the Palestinian people for their love and high praise for the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. He also said, "The Palestinian people and the Arab people can be assured that in your struggle against imperialism and Zionism, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will always stand firmly on your side."

    巴勒斯坦民族解放军进入前沿阵地
    准备在以色列进攻叙利亚时严惩侵略者
    据新华社开罗二十日电　加沙地区的巴勒斯坦军民在连续几天的纪念巴勒斯坦被侵占十九周年的活动后，已经转入紧张的战备活动，准备在以色列进犯叙利亚时，给予美帝国主义支持的犹太复国主义者以严厉的惩罚，并将开始一场解放巴勒斯坦的神圣战争。据今天此间报纸报道，巴勒斯坦民族解放军已经进入了靠近以色列的前沿阵地。
    巴勒斯坦解放组织主席舒凯里十七日晚在拉法举行的两万五千人的群众集会上，强烈谴责美帝国主义和以色列最近准备对巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯国家进行新的军事挑衅。他说：“要是美国和以色列胆敢发动新的侵略，我们将击败他们。”舒凯里说，成千上万的巴勒斯坦工人、农民和青年最近参加了民防军或人民抵抗军。他们手拿武器，不怕牺牲，决心消灭侵略者，解放他们被强夺的家园。
    舒凯里在讲话中热情赞扬中国和巴勒斯坦人民之间的战斗友谊，这时，与会群众激动地高呼：“毛泽东同志万岁！中国万岁！”“欢迎北京！欢迎革命者！”
    应邀到加沙地区参加纪念活动的中国驻阿联大使黄华在大会上讲话，受到热烈的欢迎。他在讲话中表示衷心感谢巴勒斯坦人民热爱和高度赞扬中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。他并说：“巴勒斯坦人民和阿拉伯人民可以确信，在你们反对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民将永远坚决地站在你们这一边。”
