Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art 25 years ago, is our bible for proletarian revolutionary artists.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our literature and art are for the people, primarily for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are created for the workers, peasants, and soldiers and are for their use." In practice, I deeply feel that Chairman Mao's directive is extremely wise and great.

For 17 years, the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line, with the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party as its backer, has been opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line, trying every means to obstruct our service to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and making our opera stage chaotic and filthy.

At a critical moment in the struggle between the two lines, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing came to the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1. She brought us the great thought of Mao Zedong and opened up a new path for the revolution of Peking opera.

Comrade Jiang Qing, in order to make socialist literature and art better serve proletarian politics, conducted thorough, detailed, and comprehensive investigations and research in the dramatic circles. When she first came to the troupe, she met with several of us young actors. She asked us, why are there fewer and fewer people watching old Peking opera? Why don't young students like to watch Peking opera? She patiently guided us: It is inappropriate to perform emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties on the stage of a socialist country, which is not in line with the socialist economic base and does not conform to the proletarian dictatorship. Isn't it shameful that we have been performing emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, landlords, and landladies for so many years? She called on us to do what previous generations have not done, to consciously revolutionize, and to stand at the forefront of the revolution.

Comrade Jiang Qing's words shocked us greatly, and we felt very ashamed. For the past decade or so, we only knew how to perform emperors and generals, thinking that this was serving the people. Who would have thought that we were committing crimes, doing things that undermine the socialist economic base, and it was truly heartbreaking. We eat the food of the people, but we do not serve the people, and we are truly ungrateful to the Party, to Chairman Mao, and to the people!

It was during this conversation that Comrade Jiang Qing also gave us courage and strength. She warmly encouraged us to do what previous generations have not done, to be pioneers! Under Comrade Jiang Qing's leadership, we began the great historical task of revolutionizing Peking opera.

In 1964, at the meeting of the performers of modern Peking opera, Comrade Jiang Qing once again warned us: "Our confidence in performing revolutionary modern operas in Peking opera must be firm. It is unimaginable that on the stage of our socialist motherland led by the Communist Party, the main position is not occupied by workers, peasants, and soldiers, the true creators of history, the true masters of the state. We must create art that protects our socialist economic base." Comrade Jiang Qing's words, I will always remember them in my heart.

Just as we were rehearsing "Fire in the Reed Marsh" according to Comrade Jiang Qing's instructions, the old Beijing Municipal Committee's revisionist head, with the support of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, stuck his black hand into our Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1. He talked to us actors. We said we would perform revolutionary modern operas 100%, but he maliciously said: "Why not perform traditional operas? Don't universities still teach history?" In the Peking opera revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, counter-revolutionary revisionists set up numerous obstacles, using various vile means to sabotage, and obstructing us in every possible way in terms of manpower, resources, and theater conditions. However, Comrade Jiang Qing, like a green pine, was unyielding and tenaciously led us in the struggle. In this struggle, Comrade Jiang Qing held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, united the revolutionary comrades of our troupe, and together we completed the adaptation and performance of the revolutionary model opera "Sha Jianhu." The birth of the revolutionary modern Peking opera "Sha Jianhu" is a great achievement of the struggle between the two lines, a heavy cannon shot at the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line pushed by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party! This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! This is the great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao! In this struggle, our beloved Comrade Jiang Qing made special contributions, and she has established immortal merits for the proletarian revolutionary cause.

In our interactions with Comrade Jiang Qing, we deeply felt her boundless love and loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, her extreme responsibility for the Party's cause, and her personal example of upholding principles and fighting. These have greatly inspired and educated us, making us more determined to dedicate our lives to wholeheartedly serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers.

    全心全意为工农兵服务  做京剧革命中披荆斩棘的人
    北京京剧一团　谭元寿
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在二十五年前所发表的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，是我们无产阶级革命文艺战士的宝书。
    毛主席指出：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”我在实践中，深深体会到毛主席这个指示无比英明伟大。
    十七年来，以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为总后台的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，一直是与毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线相对抗的，千方百计阻挠我们为工农兵服务，把我们的戏曲舞台搞得乌烟瘴气。
    在两条路线斗争的关键时刻，敬爱的江青同志来到了北京京剧一团。她给我们带来了伟大的毛泽东思想，为京剧的革命化开辟了崭新的道路。
    江青同志为了让社会主义的文学艺术能够更好地为无产阶级政治服务，曾经深入地、细致地、全面地在戏剧界进行过调查研究工作。她第一次来团时，就接见了我们几个青年演员。她问我们，为什么看旧京戏的人越来越少？为什么青年学生不爱看京戏？她又耐心地开导我们：社会主义国家的戏剧舞台上还演帝王将相、才子佳人，是同社会主义的经济基础不相适应的，是不符合无产阶级专政制度的。过去尽演帝王将相、才子佳人、地主爷、地主婆，不觉得可耻吗？她号召我们要做前人没有做过的事，要自觉革命，站到革命最前线上来。
    江青同志的话，使我们受到极大的震动，我们感到很惭愧。过去十几年来，就知道演帝王将相，还以为这就是为人民服务。哪想到我们是在犯罪，我们干的是破坏社会主义经济基础的事，真是痛心得很。我们吃着人民的饭，却不为人民服务，真是对不起党，对不起毛主席，对不起人民！
    就在这次谈话中，江青同志又给了我们勇气和力量。她亲切地鼓励我们要做前人所没有做过的事，要做个披荆斩棘的人！江青同志领导我们开始了具有伟大历史意义的京剧革命。
    一九六四年，在京剧现代戏观摩演出人员的座谈会上，江青同志又一次告诫我们：“对京剧演革命的现代戏这件事的信心要坚定。在共产党领导的社会主义祖国舞台上占主要地位的不是工农兵，不是这些历史真正的创造者，不是这些国家真正的主人翁，那是不能设想的事。我们要创造保护自己社会主义经济基础的文艺。”江青同志这些话，我永远铭记在心里。
    正当我们按照江青同志的指示排演《芦荡火种》的时候，旧北京市委修正主义头子，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，把黑手插进了我们北京京剧一团。他找我们演员谈话。我们说要百分之百地演革命现代戏，他却恶毒地说：“为什么不演传统戏呢？大专学校不是还上历史课吗？”在江青同志领导我们进行的京剧革命中，反革命修正主义分子设下重重障碍，利用各种卑劣手段进行破坏，在人力、物力、剧场条件等方面百般阻挠，但是，江青同志象青松一样，坚韧不拔，顽强地领导着我们战斗。在这场斗争中，江青同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结了我团广大革命同志，共同努力，完成了革命样板戏《沙家浜》的改编和排演。革命现代京剧《沙家浜》的诞生，是两条道路斗争的伟大成果，是射向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所推行的反革命修正主义文艺路线的一颗重炮弹！这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！在这场斗争中，我们敬爱的江青同志有着特殊的贡献，她为无产阶级革命事业立下了不朽的功勋。
    在我们同江青同志接触的过程中，深刻地感受到她对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限忠诚，她对党的事业极端负责任，并且以身作则，坚持原则，坚持斗争。这些，对我们是极大的鼓舞，极大的教育，使我们更加坚定了信心，决心终身全心全意地为工农兵服务。
