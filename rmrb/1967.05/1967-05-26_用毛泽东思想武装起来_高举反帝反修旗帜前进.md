The Asian-African Journalists' Association and the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation issued a joint statement calling on Asian-African revolutionary journalists to arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and march forward under the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism.

The secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association held a reception to warmly welcome the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 25th, the secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation, which is currently visiting China, signed a joint statement in Beijing today. The joint statement emphasizes that Asian-African revolutionary journalists must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and raise the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism to fulfill their tasks.

The joint statement said that both sides are determined to resolutely fight against all plots to sabotage and split the Asian-African Journalists' Association, and to high hold the banner of the revolutionary movement of Asian-African journalists.

The joint statement said that the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising up to fight against their common enemy, American imperialism. More and more people are taking up arms to fight decisively against imperialism and its puppets, and they have realized that armed struggle is the only correct means to achieve true liberation.

The joint statement warmly praised the people's war of the Vietnamese people against American aggressors and the struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.

The joint statement said that the Soviet modern revisionist leadership is colluding with American imperialism in evil deeds, trying to sell the "peace talks" scam to force the Vietnamese people to surrender to American imperialism; advocating the "Tashkent spirit" to make Arab people and "Israel" coexist peacefully; supporting fascist military regimes to sabotage the liberation movements of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; has already split the Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization and the Permanent Bureau of Writers; and is trying to split the Asian-African Journalists' Association. However, the more they deceive and betray the fighting people, the more their role as the number one accomplice of American imperialism is exposed.

The joint statement said that in China, the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, and the victory of Chairman Mao Zedong's revolutionary line have dealt a fatal blow to imperialism, its accomplice modern revisionism, and the reactionaries, further strengthening China's position as a bastion of the world revolution, and inspiring and strengthening the revolutionary liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

The joint statement said that the anti-imperialist revolutionary movements around the world, inspired by Mao Zedong Thought, are entering a new stage. More and more people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are taking Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principle and the sharpest weapon in their struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and for national liberation.

The joint statement pointed out that the anti-imperialist struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America cannot be separated from the anti-revisionist struggle. Both sides believe that modern revisionism led by the Soviet ruling group cannot occupy any position in the united front against imperialism led by American imperialism.

The joint statement said that the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation stated that in Japan, there is a sharp struggle between two lines. The Japanese Journalists' Association and the Japanese branch of the Asian-African Journalists' Association have degenerated into organizations opposing the revolutionary Chinese people and refusing to unite with the Asian-African people against imperialism, thus losing their qualifications to represent revolutionary Japanese journalists in the Asian-African revolutionary journalists' movement. A group of revolutionary journalists, led by Mr. Koyu Kobayashi, the secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association in Japan, have split from the Japanese Journalists' Association and formed the Japanese Journalists' Union. The establishment of the Japanese Journalists' Union reflects the will and determination of Japanese journalists who are resolutely implementing the revolutionary line.

The joint statement said that the secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association highly praises the revolutionary rebellious actions of Koyu Kobayashi and his colleagues in resolutely opposing the betrayal of the Asian-African people by the revisionist line, and fully supports the Japanese Journalists' Union. The secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association will maintain all contacts with Japanese revolutionary and progressive journalists through the Japanese Journalists' Union.

The joint statement said that the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation highly praises the role of the Asian-African Journalists' Association in supporting and inspiring the struggle of the Asian-African people against imperialism led by the United States and neo-colonialism, and in exposing the collusion between revisionism and imperialism.

The joint statement said that both sides believe that the Second Asian-African Journalists' Conference will contribute to the further development of the struggle of the Asian-African people. Both sides expressed full support for the holding of the Fifth Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization Conference and the Third Asian-African Writers' Conference in Beijing.

The joint statement was signed by Chahardo, General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, and Koyu Kobayashi, leader of the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation.

Those present at the signing ceremony included Manuvila, Ahmed Gora Ibrahim, Sugiyama Ichiro, and Yang Yi, members of the secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, and all members of the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 25th, the secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association held a reception today to warmly welcome the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation led by Koyu Kobayashi, and to celebrate the signing of the joint statement between the secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists' Association and the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation.

Chahardo, General Secretary of the Asian-African Journalists' Association, and Koyu Kobayashi, leader of the Japanese Journalists' Union delegation, spoke at the reception.

Mu Xin, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists' Association, Sannanayaka, Secretary-General of the Permanent Bureau of Asian-African Writers, and Tharmar, leader of the Malaysian National Liberation Alliance delegation to China, spoke at the reception.

Also present at the reception were Paron Chulawan, representative of the Thai Patriotic Front stationed abroad, Sudanese friends Kair, Wafi, and Osman, Tanzanian friend Said Salim Abdulla, Indonesian friend Afif, American friend Li Dunbai, and Japanese friends and friends from other Asian-African countries in Beijing.

    亚非记协和日本记者同盟代表团联合声明号召亚非革命新闻工作者
    用毛泽东思想武装起来  高举反帝反修旗帜前进
    亚非记协书记处举行招待会热烈欢迎日本记者同盟代表团
    据新华社二十五日讯  亚非新闻工作者协会书记处和正在中国访问的日本记者同盟代表团今天在北京签署一项联合声明。联合声明强调指出，亚非革命的新闻工作者要完成他们的任务，必须以毛泽东思想武装自己，举起反帝反修的旗帜前进。
    联合声明说，双方表示决心同破坏和分裂亚非记协的一切阴谋活动进行坚决的斗争，高高举起革命的亚非新闻工作者运动的旗帜。
    联合声明说，亚非拉人民正奋起跟共同敌人美帝国主义进行斗争，越来越多的人民拿起武器，向帝国主义及其傀儡进行了坚决的斗争，并意识到武装斗争是他们取得真正解放的唯一正确的手段。
    联合声明热情赞扬了越南人民的反对美国侵略者的人民战争和日本人民反对美帝国主义和日本反动派的斗争。
    联合声明说，苏联现代修正主义领导集团正同美帝国主义狼狈为奸，竭力进行出卖亚非人民和全世界人民斗争的罪恶活动。他们推销“和谈”骗局，企图迫使越南人民向美帝投降；宣扬“塔什干精神”，使阿拉伯人民和“以色列”和平共处；支持法西斯军事政权，破坏亚非拉解放运动；已经分裂了亚非人民团结组织和作家常设局；还想分裂亚非新闻工作者协会。但是，他们愈是欺骗和出卖战斗的人民，他们作为美帝头号帮凶的面目就愈益暴露。
    联合声明说，在中国，由毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，毛泽东主席的革命路线的胜利，给了帝国主义、它的帮凶现代修正主义及反动派以致命的打击，进一步加强了中国作为世界革命堡垒的地位，鼓舞和加强了亚、非、拉美革命解放运动。
    联合声明说，全世界反帝的革命运动，受到毛泽东思想的鼓舞，正进入新阶段。为数越来越多的亚非拉的人民在进行反对帝国主义，反对现代修正主义和争取民族解放的斗争中，把毛泽东思想作为指导方针和最锐利的武器。
    联合声明指出，亚非拉人民的反帝斗争决不能与反修斗争分割。双方认为，以苏联统治集团为领导的现代修正主义在反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的统一战线里，决不能占有任何位置。
    联合声明说，日本记者同盟代表团说明，在日本，正在进行两条路线之间的尖锐斗争。日本记者会议和亚非记协日本协议会已经堕落成反对革命的中国人民和拒绝与亚非人民进行反帝团结的组织，因而失去了代表在亚非革命新闻工作者运动中的革命的日本新闻工作者的资格。以日本驻亚非记协书记处书记小林雄一先生为首的一批革命新闻工作者从日本记者会议中分离出来了，组成了日本记者同盟，日本记者同盟的成立反映了坚决贯彻革命路线的日本新闻工作者的意志和决心。
    联合声明说，亚非记协书记处高度赞扬小林雄一和他的同行坚决反对背叛亚非人民的修正主义路线的革命造反行动，并且表示完全支持日本记者同盟。亚非记协书记处将通过日本记者同盟与日本革命的进步的新闻工作者保持一切联系。
    联合声明说，日本记者同盟代表团高度赞扬亚非记协在支持和鼓舞亚非人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争和在揭露修正主义与帝国主义勾结方面所起的作用。
    联合声明说，双方认为，第二次亚非新闻工作者会议将对亚非人民斗争的进一步发展作出贡献。双方表示完全支持在北京召开第五届亚非人民团结组织会议和第三届亚非作家会议。
    在联合声明上签字的是亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多和日本记者同盟代表团团长小林雄一。
    参加签字仪式的有亚非新闻工作者协会书记处成员曼努维拉、艾哈迈德·高拉·易卜拉欣、杉山市平和杨翊，以及日本记者同盟代表团全体成员。
    据新华社二十五日讯  亚非新闻工作者协会书记处今天举行招待会，热烈欢迎以小林雄一为首的日本记者同盟代表团，并庆祝亚非新闻工作者协会书记处和日本记者同盟代表团的联合声明签字。
