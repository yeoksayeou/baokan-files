Albanian newspapers on May 11 published editorials celebrating the first anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Albanian Joint Statement in Beijing last year. They enthusiastically praised the revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of Albania and China, and hailed the brilliant victories achieved by the two peoples on all fronts over the past year.

The editorial in the newspaper "People's Voice" was titled: "Revolutionary Friendship and Unity in the Struggle Against Imperialism and Revisionism, for the Victory of Marxism-Leninism." The editorial stated: In the year following the publication of the Sino-Albanian Joint Statement, which was filled with significant events, the fundamental correctness of the historical Marxist-Leninist document was fully confirmed. The unity in thought and action between Albania and China, as fully embodied in the Joint Statement, has further grown and strengthened. This friendship and unity, based on Marxism-Leninism, was forged by the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial said: Over the past year, our two peoples have achieved new successes and victories in the construction of socialism and the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. For the Albanian people, the past year was a year of historic significance marked by the convening of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour, the publication of the open letter from the Central Committee of the Party to the nation, the programmatic speech delivered by Comrade Hoxha in February this year, and the initiative by the Central Committee and the Council of Ministers to further advance the revolutionary movement among the masses of working people. It was a year of great patriotic mobilization under the revolutionary banner of the Party, a year of further revolutionizing all aspects of national life, and a year of new victories in socialist construction.

The editorial quoted the words of Chairman Mao in his congratulatory message to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania: "The glorious Party of Labour of Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has steadfastly held high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism in the midst of the encirclement by imperialism and modern revisionism." "Heroic Albania of the people has become a great beacon of socialism in Europe." "Believe, comrades, that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight together, and win together." The editorial said, the Albanian people deeply appreciate Comrade Mao Zedong's lofty evaluation and the genuine internationalist aid provided by the fraternal Chinese people to Albania's socialist construction and the consolidation of the revolutionary victories of the Albanian people.

The editorial pointed out: For the heroic Chinese people, this was a year of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a year of further revolutionization, and a year of new achievements in the struggle against the capitalist roaders in power within the Party. The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ignited personally by Chairman Mao, are burning away reactionary forces and fundamentally eliminating the danger of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China. This is why the Soviet revisionist leaders continue to conduct a comprehensive anti-China campaign. The Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin revisionist clique, in collusion with imperialism and reactionaries, openly shelter Chinese reactionary bourgeois and revisionist elements. They have carried out unprecedented provocations and malicious anti-China conspiracies against China, shouting about how the Chinese people have "trampled on democracy and human rights." No, there will never be democracy in China for imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism's friends and accomplices—landlords, capitalists, fascists, revisionists, and various social scum. In China, the true democracy of the billions of people who are carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is flourishing. Only with the iron broom of class and class struggle can the enemies of socialism be swept away from society, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, which practices democracy for the broad masses of working people and strikes with an iron fist against the enemies of the people and socialism, can be strengthened.

The editorial said: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has greatly promoted the political enthusiasm of the masses, achieved decisive victories over capitalism and revisionism, and thus strengthened the socialist and revolutionary camp worldwide. It is a more powerful support for the fraternal peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism. The Chinese people, without reservation, adhere to the principle of proletarian internationalist aid, turning their country into a strong rear base that is always ready to help the Vietnamese people and all peoples fighting against imperialism, colonialism, and their lackeys. The international prestige of socialist China has never been as high as it is today.

The fraternal Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, have successfully advanced the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, achieved new victories in socialist construction, consolidated the national economy, and enhanced national defense capabilities.

The editorial said, the continuous success of the socialist revolutions in the two countries and the comprehensive consolidation of the fruits of socialist victory have great international significance and further enrich the treasury of Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial said: Over the past year, the experiences of the peoples of various countries have proven that the strategy of people's war is defeating the global strategy of imperialism. The brave Vietnamese people are making the U.S. imperialists suffer one defeat after another, and the flames of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are spreading. The revolutionary forces, led by Marxist-Leninist parties and groups, are growing and expanding their ranks, establishing a true international united front against imperialism. Life fully proves the correctness of the principled stance expressed by the two parties in the Joint Statement: opposing U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys and opposing modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership are two inseparable tasks. Only by resolutely opposing modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership can one successfully oppose U.S. imperialism.

The editorial pointed out that the Albanian people and the Party of Labour of Albania regard the Sino-Albanian Joint Statement as an invincible historical Marxist-Leninist document and a testament to the ironclad revolutionary unity and vital friendship between the two peoples and parties.

The Albanian people and the Party of Labour of Albania will continue to steadfastly struggle to implement the immortal principles of this statement. Under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people will advance shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Chinese people in the common struggle for the victory of socialism and communism, against the common enemies—imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

The editorial in the newspaper "Unity" published on the same day said: The Sino-Albanian Joint Statement is not only of great importance to the two peoples and parties but also to the entire international communist movement. The statement's assertions about the existence of class struggle in socialist society, the existence of antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions, the need to steadfastly and continuously defend and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the importance of self-reliance, adhering to the mass line, relying on the masses, and launching mass revolutionary movements are great contributions to the revolution and socialism and are very valuable experiences.

The editorial said: The statement's very important assertion that the time has come to draw clear lines with revisionism in political, ideological, and organizational issues has consolidated the global position of genuine Marxism-Leninism.

The editorial said: The great Chinese people of over 700 million have achieved magnificent achievements this year. The Chinese people have steadfastly adhered to the great teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, further advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the conspiracies of revisionist elements who have infiltrated the Party and state organs, and thus eliminating all possibilities of the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in China. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, is not only a great victory for the Chinese people but also for the international communist movement and all revolutionary peoples of the world. It is a valuable contribution to the further development of Marxism-Leninism in the contemporary era.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸欢呼阿中联合声明签署一周年
    阿中社会主义革命不断取得新的胜利
    两国人民的战斗团结和友谊日益加强
    新华社地拉那十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚报纸十一日发表社论，热烈欢呼去年五月十一日在北京签署的阿尔巴尼亚中国联合声明发表一周年，热烈赞扬阿中两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结，欢呼阿中两国人民一年来在各个战线上取得的光辉胜利。
    《人民之声报》社论的题目是：《在反对帝国主义和修正主义、争取马克思列宁主义胜利的斗争中的革命友谊和团结》。社论说：在阿尔巴尼亚中国联合声明发表后的充满重要事件的这一年，证实了这个具有历史意义的马克思列宁主义的文献的根本论点的完全正确性。充分体现在联合声明中的阿中之间在思想和行动上的团结与革命友谊，现在有了进一步的增长和加强。这种建立在马克思列宁主义基础之上的友谊和团结，是由以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和由以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党锤炼起来的。
    社论说：一年来，我们两国人民在社会主义建设和巩固无产阶级专政的道路上取得了新的成就和胜利。过去的一年对于阿尔巴尼亚人民来说，是具有历史意义的劳动党第五次代表大会召开的一年，是劳动党中央致全国人民的公开信发表的一年，是霍查同志今年二月六日发表纲领性讲话的一年，是党中央和部长会议发表关于在劳动人民群众中进一步开展革命运动的倡议的一年。这是劳动群众在党的革命旗帜下进行伟大爱国动员的一年，是国家一切生活进一步革命化的一年，是社会主义建设取得新的胜利的一年。
    社论援引了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中的话：“以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的重重包围之中，坚定地高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗。”“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”社论说，阿尔巴尼亚人民深切感谢毛泽东同志的这一崇高评价以及兄弟的中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设和巩固阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命胜利所给予的真正的国际主义的援助。
    社论指出：对于英雄的中国人民来说，这是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利的一年，是进一步革命化的一年，是在反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中取得新的成就的一年。毛泽东主席亲自点燃的中国无产阶级文化大革命的火焰正在烧毁反动势力，正在从根本上消除在中国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的危险。这就是为什么苏联修正主义领导人继续疯狂地进行全面的反华运动的原因所在。赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫和柯西金修正主义集团与帝国主义和反动派同流合污，公开庇护中国反动的资产阶级、修正主义分子。他们对中国进行前所未有的挑衅行动和罪恶的反华阴谋，叫喊什么中国人民“践踏了民主和人的权利”。不，在中国永远也不会有帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的朋友和伙伴——地主、资本家、法西斯分子、修正主义分子和各种社会垃圾的民主了。在中国，真正的民主、起来进行无产阶级文化大革命的亿万群众的民主正在广泛发展。只有用阶级和阶级斗争的铁扫帚才能把社会主义的敌人从社会上扫除掉，才能加强对广大劳动人民群众实行民主和对人民与社会主义的敌人实行铁拳打击的无产阶级专政。
    社论说：中国无产阶级文化大革命大大促进了亿万群众的政治积极性，取得了对资本主义和修正主义的决定性胜利，从而加强了全世界的社会主义和革命阵地。它是对正在进行反对帝国主义和殖民主义斗争的兄弟的亚非拉人民更加强有力的声援。中国人民毫无保留地履行无产阶级国际主义援助的原则，把自己的国家变成了时刻准备帮助越南和一切正在进行反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义及其仆从的人民的强大后方。社会主义中国的国际威望从来没有象今天这样高。
    兄弟的中国人民高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，成功地把无产阶级文化大革命推向前进，在社会主义建设中取得了新的胜利，巩固了国民经济，增强了国防能力。
    社论说，阿中两国社会主义革命不断成功的发展，以及社会主义胜利果实的全面巩固，具有重大的国际意义，进一步丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。
    社论说：一年来，世界各国人民的经验证实，人民战争的战略正在战胜帝国主义的全球战略。英勇的越南人民正在使美帝国主义遭受一个又一个的失败，亚非拉反对帝国主义的革命斗争的火焰熊熊蔓延。同帝国主义和修正主义的神圣同盟相对抗的、以马克思列宁主义政党和小组为首的革命力量正在壮大，正在扩大自己的队伍，建立起真正的反对帝国主义的国际统一战线。生活完全证明，我们两党在联合声明中表示的下述原则性立场的正确性：反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗和反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，这是不可分割的两项任务。只有坚决反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，才能胜利地反对美帝国主义。
    社论指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党把阿尔巴尼亚中国联合声明看作是一个战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的历史性文献，是两国人民、两党钢铁般的革命团结和具有生命力的友谊的明证。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党今后仍将始终不渝地为贯彻这一声明的不朽原则而斗争。在以霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民将同兄弟的中国人民一起，在争取社会主义和共产主义胜利、反对共同的敌人——帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的共同斗争中，并肩前进。
    《团结报》同一天发表的社论说：阿尔巴尼亚中国联合声明不仅对两国人民和两党，而且对整个国际共产主义运动都有着十分重要的意义。声明指出的关于在社会主义社会还存在着阶级斗争，存在着对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾的论断；关于必须坚持不渝地、不断地捍卫和加强无产阶级专政；以及关于自力更生，坚持不渝地贯彻群众路线，坚决依靠群众，开展群众革命运动等重要论断，是对于革命和社会主义的巨大贡献，是非常宝贵的经验。
    社论说，声明中关于同修正主义在政治、思想和组织问题等方面划清界限的时候已经来到的这一十分重要的论断，巩固了全世界真正的马克思列宁主义的阵地。
    社论说：伟大的七亿中国人民在这一年中取得了宏伟的成就。中国人民坚持不渝地遵循毛泽东同志的伟大学说，进一步推进了无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了钻进党和国家机关中的修正主义分子的阴谋，从而根除了在中国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义的一切可能性。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，毛泽东思想的胜利，不仅是中国人民，而且是国际共产主义运动以及世界所有革命人民的伟大胜利，是对当代进一步发展马克思列宁主义的又一宝贵贡献。
