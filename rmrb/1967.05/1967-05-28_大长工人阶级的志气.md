We watched the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor" with boundless excitement. This play passionately praises the working class of New China, armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only the working class has the foresight, is selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution. The entire history of the revolution proves that without the leadership of the working class, the revolution will fail; with the leadership of the working class, the revolution will succeed." "The Harbor" follows Chairman Mao's great teachings and successfully creates the heroic image of revolutionary workers like Fang Haijian, Gao Zhiyang, and Old Master Ma, truly portraying the great spirit of the working class in the Mao Zedong era.

They never forget class struggle, standing firm in the storms of class struggle, with keen senses, as Fang Haijian sings in the play: "In victory, one must keep a clear mind, on the journey, there is class struggle everywhere!... The storm increases the fighting spirit;..."

They never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, with strong hands holding the seal of revolution, allowing people like Qian Shouwei to behave properly, not allowing them to cause trouble.

They never forget to prioritize proletarian politics, "how can one grasp the revolution without politics first," actively learning and applying the "Three Articles," eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, daring to take on heavy responsibilities for the revolution.

They never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, standing in Shanghai Harbor, looking out at the world, and promoting a high degree of proletarian internationalism. "For the revolution, even if mountains and seas block the way, we will definitely send our deep affection to all directions!"

Fang Haijian, Gao Zhiyang, and Old Master Ma are typical representatives of the Chinese working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly in them!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must rely wholeheartedly on the working class." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party goes against Chairman Mao, saying, "The working class may not be reliable at certain times.... Don't think that relying on the working class is problem-free." This is a malicious slander against our working class. He also advocates "exploitation is meritorious," "exploitation is reasonable," "capitalists also serve the people." In his eyes, there is no working class, only people like Qian Shouwei, the warehouse manager! What he pursues is the capitalist restoration that Qian Shouwei dreams of! Birds of a feather flock together. Isn't Qian Shouwei the one who deliberately shouts at the workers, "Can we manage the dock with people like us?" When American imperialism was driven out of the Chinese mainland, didn't it arrogantly predict that "they will manage the great Shanghai," determining that we "will turn red when we come in, but in three months, we will turn moldy and black"? The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and the bourgeoisie, imperialists are so alike! In his view, the great Chinese working class is just "ignorant" and "uneducated" "mob"! We must shout at him: Shut up! Do not attack the great, advanced working class!

The revolutionary modern Beijing opera "The Harbor" uses living examples to tell people: Workers like Fang Haijian, Gao Zhiyang, and Old Master Ma are real heroes! Such heroes can withstand the collapse of the sky and fill the earth! Such heroes are the true masters of history, the true masters of our era!

"The people, only the people, are the motive force in creating world history." This play greatly boosts the spirit of the working class and greatly diminishes the arrogance of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. This play is great, and we must shout it out loud!

    大长工人阶级的志气
    解放军某部战士　房国忠　畅玉玺
    我们怀着无限激动的心情观看了革命现代京剧《海港》。这出戏满腔热情地歌颂了用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国的工人阶级。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。整个革命历史证明，没有工人阶级的领导，革命就要失败，有了工人阶级的领导，革命就胜利了。”《海港》遵循毛主席的这一伟大教导，成功地塑造了方海珍、高志扬、老马师傅等高大的革命工人的英雄群像，真实地表现了毛泽东时代工人阶级的伟大气魄。
    他们念念不忘阶级斗争，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里立场坚定，嗅觉灵敏，正如戏里方海珍唱的那样：“胜利中须保持头脑清醒，征途上处处有阶级斗争！……暴风雨更增添战斗豪情；……”
    他们念念不忘无产阶级专政，“粗大的手，把革命大印来掌”，只许钱守维之流老老实实，不许他们乱说乱动。
    他们念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，“抓革命怎能忘政治先行”，活学活用“老三篇”，破私立公，为革命就敢挑重担。
    他们念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，站在上海港，放眼全世界，发扬了高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。“为革命，哪怕山高海阔来阻挡，定要把深情厚谊，送往那四面八方！”
    方海珍、高志扬以及老马师傅，他们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级的典型，在他们身上，闪烁着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级。”而党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，却和毛主席唱反调，胡说什么“工人阶级在一定的时候也可能是不能依靠。……不要以为依靠工人阶级是没有问题的。”这是对我们工人阶级的恶毒污蔑。他还大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”，“剥削有理”，“资本家也是为人民服务”。他眼里根本就没有工人阶级，有的是象戏里钱守维那样的栈房先生！他所追求的，也就是钱守维所梦想的资本主义复辟！物以类聚，人以群分。钱守维不就是别有用心地对工人叫嚣：“靠咱们这号人还能管好码头”吗？美帝国主义在滚出中国大陆时，不是也猖狂地预言什么“大上海他们管不了”，断定我们“红着进来，不出三个月就会发霉、变黑”吗？党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和资产阶级、帝国主义者是那样的臭味相投！在他看来，伟大的中国工人阶级不过是“愚昧”、“无知”的“群氓”！我们要向他大喝一声：住嘴！不准你攻击伟大的、先进的工人阶级！
    革命现代京剧《海港》用活生生的事迹告诉人们：象方海珍、高志扬、老马师傅这样的工人阶级，是真正的英雄好汉！这样的英雄，天塌下来能顶住，地陷下去能填平！这样的英雄是真正的历史的主人，是我们时代的真正的主人！
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”《海港》这出戏大长了工人阶级的志气，大灭了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的威风。这出戏就是好，我们要为它大喊大叫！
