To celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," revolutionary artists, revolutionary workers, PLA cultural soldiers, and Red Guards from Jinan formed dozens of artistic propaganda teams on May 23rd and took to the streets to perform revolutionary songs and dances, transforming many streets and public spaces in Jinan into bastions for propagating Mao Zedong Thought.

The participating proletarian revolutionaries, with the greatest political enthusiasm, sang praises of our great leader Chairman Mao, sang praises of the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and sang praises of the great victories of the Cultural Revolution over the past year. At the same time, with intense class hatred, they used art as a weapon to launch a fierce attack on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Wherever they performed, crowds gathered, and the atmosphere was electric.

In front of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, revolutionary cultural soldiers from the Jinan Garrison's Vanguard Song and Dance Troupe and Drama Troupe performed for the revolutionary masses, including the chorus "Heartily Celebrating the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of Chairman Mao's 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art,'" the small chorus "The Army and the People Are One Family," "Just Like the Old Red Army," and the Tianjin clapper talk "Down with China's Khrushchev." These performances enthusiastically praised the great victories of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line and expressed the determination of revolutionary cultural soldiers to march forward forever along Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

    济南数十支文艺宣传队上街表演革命歌舞
    为欢庆毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十五周年，济南革命文艺工作者、革命工人、解放军文艺战士和红卫兵小将，二十三日组成几十支文艺宣传队，走上街头演出革命歌舞，把济南的许多街道、公共场所变成了宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
    参加演出的无产阶级革命派，以最大的政治热情歌颂我们伟大的领袖毛主席，歌颂毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，歌颂一年来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。同时，他们怀着强烈的阶级仇恨，以文艺为武器，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。他们在哪里演出，哪里就人山人海，一片沸腾。
    在省革命委员会门前，济南驻军前卫歌舞团、话剧团的革命文艺战士，为广大革命群众演出了联唱《热烈欢呼毛主席〈在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话〉发表二十五周年》、小合唱《军队和老百姓本是一家人》、《多象当年老红军》以及天津快板《打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫》等节目。这些节目热情歌颂了毛主席的革命文艺路线的伟大胜利，表达了革命文艺战士永远沿着毛主席的革命文艺路线奋勇前进的决心。
