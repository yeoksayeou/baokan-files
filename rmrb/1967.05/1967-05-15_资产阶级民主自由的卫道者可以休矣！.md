The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is the broadest, deepest, and greatest revolutionary mass movement in history. It is a great democratic movement under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Lin Biao has said: "Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's correct line, the broad revolutionary masses in our country have created new experience in the development of great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This great democracy is the Party's fearless encouragement of the broad masses to use the forms of great debate, great criticism, big-character posters, great linking up, and great struggle to criticize and supervise the leading organs and leading personnel at all levels of the Party and the state."

During the Cultural Revolution, the 700 million Chinese people, who make up one-fourth of the world's population, have taken up the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and used the weapon of great democracy on an unprecedented scale to launch a criticism of the old world, old things, and old ideas. They have exposed a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, big and small, swept away all monsters and demons, thoroughly smashed the four olds of the exploiting classes, and established the four news of the proletariat, achieving one great victory after another.

This is the highest level of true proletarian democracy in human history, a great innovation in the international communist movement, and a great event of epoch-making significance that shakes the world!

The Soviet revisionist leading clique is terrified and panic-stricken at our great proletarian democracy. They sing in unison with U.S. imperialism, viciously attacking our great proletarian democracy as "suppressing democracy" and "destroying freedom," and so on, ad nauseam. These bourgeois gentlemen have actually dressed themselves up as the defenders of "democracy" and "freedom."

What is "democracy"? What is "freedom"? Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have long taught us that in class society, democracy and freedom have always been class-based—there is only class democracy and freedom, not abstract, classless democracy and freedom. There is bourgeois democracy and freedom, and there is proletarian democracy and freedom. The two are fundamentally opposed and irreconcilable.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has proven this truth with a wealth of facts.

To be frank, the Soviet revisionist leading clique's vicious attacks on our Cultural Revolution are too blatant, so everyone can see clearly: the Soviet gentlemen are so furious and abusive precisely because we have rebelled against a handful of revisionists within the Party, seized their power, and taken over their government. The Soviets are merely crying out for their comrades, hoping that we revolutionary masses will show mercy, so they can rise again!

Of course, this is absolutely impossible.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We do not practice benevolence towards the reactionaries and the reactionary classes. We practice benevolence only within the people, not towards the reactionaries and the reactionary classes outside the people." A handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are our people's sworn enemies. We must not practice benevolence towards them. We must fight them down, fight them to the ground, fight them to the end, and uproot the revisionist roots in our country, ensuring that our socialist state will never change color.

In the midst of their attacks on our proletarian great democracy, the Soviet revisionist leading clique has even sung praises for themselves, boasting about the so-called "democracy" and "freedom" in today's Soviet Union. This is indeed, as Lenin said, "taking their own shame and boasting about it," shameless to the extreme.

Well then, if that is the case, we would like to ask: in today's Soviet Union under your rule, what "democracy" do you have? What "freedom" do you have?

Do you allow the Soviet people to uphold the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism, maintain the glorious traditions of the October Revolution, and defend the achievements of socialist construction?

Do you allow the Soviet people to oppose your revisionist rule, oppose the restoration of capitalism, and oppose your surrender to U.S. imperialism and betrayal of the world revolution?

Do you allow the Soviet people to oppose the privileges of your ruling class, the workers' aristocracy, and their bullying and oppression?

Do you allow the Soviet people to put revolutionary big-character posters on the walls of the Kremlin, allow them to engage in revolutionary debates and revolutionary linking up in streets, alleys, factories, schools, cities, and villages, and allow them to expose your revisionist crimes and rebel against you?

Of course, you dare not do any of these things. In your country, there are only truncheons, whips, prisons, and insane asylums. Anyone who dares to express the slightest dissatisfaction with your revisionist rule or resist will immediately be arrested, suppressed, and even killed. The so-called "democracy" and "freedom" you advocate are nothing but thoroughgoing bourgeois "democracy" and "freedom," the kind that Johnson boasts about!

At this point, it is not difficult to understand why the Soviet revisionist leading clique launches such vicious slander and attacks on our proletarian great democracy. They are afraid that the flames of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will burn away their cover of bourgeois "democracy" and "freedom," exposing their treacherous faces to the broad Soviet people. They know that if the Soviet people rise up to rebel against this handful of revisionists, their revisionist rule will be finished.

But paper cannot cover fire. The Soviet revisionist leading clique wants to use the methods of distorting right and wrong and slandering to block the influence of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, cover up the truth of their revisionist rule, and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the Soviet people. How can this be possible? More and more Soviet people have seen through the traitorous faces of the Soviet revisionist leading clique from a wealth of facts. Under the powerful impact of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the Soviet people will one day raise the revolutionary banner of "Rebellion is Justified," launch a stormy revolutionary struggle on Soviet soil, smash the shackles of revisionist rule, and throw this handful of Soviet revisionist leaders into the dustbin of history. At that time, the red flag of Marxism-Leninism will once again fly over the Kremlin, the dictatorship of the proletariat will once again replace today's bourgeois dictatorship, and proletarian great democracy will shine brilliantly in the homeland of the October Revolution!

### 资产阶级民主自由的卫道者可以休矣！

    资产阶级民主自由的卫道者可以休矣！
    哈尔滨军事工程学院红色造反团　红尖兵
    我国的无产阶级文化大革命，是历史上最广泛、最深刻、最伟大的革命的群众运动，是无产阶级专政下的大民主运动。
    林彪同志说：“在毛主席正确路线的指引下，我国广大革命群众，创造了无产阶级专政下发展大民主的新经验。这种大民主，就是党无所畏惧地让广大群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论、大串连的形式，批评和监督党和国家的各级领导机关和各级领导人。”
    在文化大革命中，占世界人口四分之一的七亿中国人民，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，运用大民主的武器，在空前未有的广阔规模上发动了对旧世界、旧事物、旧思想的批判，揪出了党内一小撮大大小小走资本主义道路的当权派，横扫一切牛鬼蛇神，大破剥削阶级的四旧，大立无产阶级的四新，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。
    这是人类有史以来从未有过的高度的真正的无产阶级民主，这是国际共产主义运动中的伟大创举，这是震撼世界的划时代的伟大事件！
    苏修领导集团对于我们的无产阶级大民主胆战心惊，恐慌之至。他们同美帝国主义一唱一和，恶毒攻击我们的无产阶级大民主是什么“压制民主”啦，“破坏自由”啦，等等，不一而足。这些资产阶级老爷们居然把自己打扮成为“民主”、“自由”的卫道者了。
    什么是“民主”？什么是“自由”？马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想早就教导我们，在阶级社会里，民主和自由从来就是有阶级性的——只有阶级的民主自由，没有抽象的超阶级的民主自由。有资产阶级的民主自由，就没有无产阶级的民主自由；有无产阶级的民主自由，就没有资产阶级的民主自由。两者是根本对立，不可调和的。
    中国的无产阶级文化大革命，以大量的事实证明了这个真理。
    老实说，苏修领导集团恶毒地攻击我国文化大革命的这一套把戏耍得太露骨了，所以谁都看得明白：苏修老爷们这样暴跳如雷，破口大骂，就是因为我们造了党内一小撮修正主义分子的反，夺了他们的权，专了他们的政。苏修不过是在为自己的同伙喊冤叫屈，妄想我们革命群众手下留情，好让他们东山再起罢了！
    当然，这是绝对办不到的。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们对于反动派和反动阶级的反动行为，决不施仁政。我们仅仅施仁政于人民内部，而不施于人民外部的反动派和反动阶级的反动行为。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是我们革命人民的死敌。我们决不能对他们施仁政。我们一定要把他们斗倒，斗臭，斗垮，把他们斩草除根，彻底挖掉在我国的修正主义根子，保证我国的社会主义江山永不变色。
    苏修领导集团在攻击我们无产阶级大民主的一片叫嚣声中，居然还为自己唱起赞美诗来，吹嘘今天苏联的所谓“民主”“自由”。这真是象列宁说的那样“却把自己的耻辱拿来吹嘘”，无耻到极点了。
    好吧！既然如此，我们倒要请问一声，在你们统治下的今天的苏联，究竟有什么“民主”？有什么“自由”？
    你们能允许苏联人民坚持马列主义的革命原则，维护十月革命的光荣传统，保卫社会主义建设的成果吗？
    你们能允许苏联人民反对你们的修正主义统治，反对资本主义复辟，反对你们投降美帝、出卖世界革命吗？
    你们能允许苏联人民反对你们这些特权阶层、工人贵族多吃多占，作威作福吗？
    你们能允许苏联人民把革命的大字报贴到克里姆林宫的墙上，允许他们在街头巷尾、工厂学校、城市乡村进行革命的大辩论，革命的大串连，允许他们起来揭你们修正主义的老底，造你们的反吗？
    当然，你们是万万不敢这样做的。在你们那里，有的是警棍、皮鞭、监狱、疯人院，谁要是对你们的修正主义统治稍有不满，敢于反抗，就会立即被逮捕，镇压，以至遭到杀身之祸。你们宣扬的所谓“民主”“自由”，原来就是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的“民主”“自由”，就是约翰逊所吹嘘的那种“民主”“自由”！
    说到这里，也就不难明白，为什么苏修领导集团对我们的无产阶级大民主要进行这样恶毒的诽谤和攻击了。因为他们害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，烧掉他们这块资产阶级“民主”“自由”的遮羞布，而在苏联广大人民面前露出他们这一伙无产阶级革命叛徒的丑恶嘴脸来。他们知道，要是苏联人民也象中国人民那样起来造他们这一小撮修正主义分子的反，他们的修正主义统治就要完蛋了。
    但是，纸是包不住火的。苏修领导集团想用颠倒黑白，诽谤污蔑的手段来封锁中国文化大革命的影响，掩盖他们修正主义统治的真相，压制苏联人民的革命斗争，又怎么可能呢？越来越多的苏联人民已经从大量事实中看清楚苏修领导集团的叛徒面目了。在中国文化大革命的有力冲击之下，苏联人民总有一天也会举起“造反有理”的革命旗帜，在苏联国土上展开一场急风暴雨的革命斗争，粉碎修正主义统治的枷锁，把这一小撮苏修头目扔进历史的垃圾堆。到那时候，马克思列宁主义的红旗将重新飘扬在克里姆林宫的上空，无产阶级专政将重新取代今天的资产阶级专政，而无产阶级大民主，也必将在十月革命的故乡放射出它的灿烂的光辉！
