Our great leader Chairman Mao last year on May 7th sent a letter to his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, calling on us: the People's Liberation Army should be a great school, in addition to fighting, it can do all kinds of work. We must learn politics, learn military affairs, learn culture. We must participate in the criticism of the bourgeois cultural revolution at all times. We must combine military training, agriculture, industry, and civilian affairs. Simultaneously, factories, villages, schools, commerce, service industries, and party and government agencies should all become revolutionary great schools. Chairman Mao's directive has great historical and strategic significance. This directive is a permanent guideline for our military construction, and it is also a fundamental measure to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, prevent capitalist restoration, and build socialism, gradually transitioning to communism. This directive summarizes the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship in our country and internationally. Its entire thought is a new era in Marxism-Leninism, a new peak in scientific communist theory.

The People's Liberation Army is created by our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. As early as the initial period of our army's establishment, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out that our army is not just for fighting, but is a armed group executing revolutionary political tasks. Later, Chairman Mao also set three major tasks for our army: fighting, doing mass work, and production. He pointed out that our army will forever be a fighting team, but also a work team and a production team. The great call for the People's Liberation Army to be a great school is a new development of Chairman Mao's consistent military-building thought in the period of socialist revolution and socialist construction, raising the theory of proletarian military building to a new stage. Following Chairman Mao's brilliant military-building thought, we can build our army into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has decided that our army will support the local proletarian cultural revolution, execute support for the broad leftist masses, support industry, support agriculture, implement military control and military training, and participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. This is a very glorious task, and it is also a wise decision to ensure the thorough victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. At the same time, it is a major measure to fully implement the "May 7th Directive" and turn the entire country and army into revolutionary great schools.

Supporting the local proletarian cultural revolution has made our army's establishment of a great school of Mao Zedong Thought even richer in content, more vivid, and more practical in the classroom. Class struggle in practice is our best political class, the broad revolutionary masses are our best teachers. We must, in the current fiery struggle of supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, firmly execute Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," combine the study of the greatest Mao Zedong Thought with the richest practical struggle, and make the great school of Mao Zedong Thought even better.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a strong army." In the past, the Chinese people, under Chairman Mao's command, mainly relied on the army to seize power. Today, we still need to rely on the army to maintain and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship. Our army is the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. We not only need to deal with imperialism, modern revisionism, and their running dogs trying to overthrow our regime from the outside, but we must also be especially vigilant and prevent revisionism from seizing the leadership of the party and the state from within, implementing capitalist restoration. Therefore, our army must not only be able to fight but also learn to engage in sharp and complex class struggle with the bourgeoisie, with those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and with revisionist elements. We must learn to use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, mobilize the broad masses, and together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, seize power from those in power within the party who are taking the capitalist road from below, and hold and use power well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn it." Comrade Lin Biao points out: "The surging mass movement always inspires and educates the army in return, becoming a revolutionary furnace for tempering and raising the political awareness of the army." Our army's broad cadres and soldiers, in the fiery class struggle of supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture, will establish a great school of Mao Zedong Thought, experience wind and rain, see the world, and truly master Mao Zedong Thought. Tens of thousands of new people of communism will quickly grow up in this great school.

Mao Zedong Thought is about class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. We must throw ourselves into the fiery class struggle of supporting the left, supporting industry, and supporting agriculture to further understand the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, enhance the consciousness of class struggle, and be good at distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, right and wrong in sharp and complex class struggles, firmly grasping the general direction of the struggle. We must learn to swim while swimming, learn the skills of seizing power, holding power, and using power for the proletariat in the current class struggle.

Believing in the masses and relying on the masses is a fundamental principle of Mao Zedong Thought. Establishing a firm mass perspective and correctly treating the masses is a fundamental content of our army's ideological construction. We must throw ourselves into the magnificent revolutionary mass movement to recognize that "the masses are the real heroes," establish a firm belief in the masses and rely on the masses, and deeply understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Currently, the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is also a great struggle between the two worldviews in people's minds. In the fiery class struggle, contradictions are the sharpest, struggles are the most intense, and it can touch people's souls the most, posing a stern test for everyone. We must throw ourselves into this struggle to better break private interests and establish public interests, more effectively transform our worldview, and accelerate ideological revolutionization.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the party openly advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle, advocating what they call "closing the door for cultivation," attempting to make us detach from the real class struggle, detach from politics, detach from revolution, not care about state affairs, and forget the proletarian dictatorship. This is completely contrary to the spirit of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." We must thoroughly criticize "Cultivation" and do the opposite.

At present, we are at a crucial moment in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Nationwide, a great mass movement of revolutionary criticism against the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in the party is unfolding. This is the central topic of the current class struggle. Our army's leadership at all levels and the broad cadres and soldiers must further study Chairman Mao's great directive on turning the entire country and army into revolutionary great schools, more consciously implement this directive, closely combine the struggle of supporting the left with army building, and turn the process of the struggle of supporting the left into the process of army revolutionary construction. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, in the revolutionary great criticism, in executing the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training, in the fiery class struggle, establish the great school of Mao Zedong Thought even better.

### 在火热的阶级斗争中办好毛泽东思想大学校

    在火热的阶级斗争中办好毛泽东思想大学校
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，去年五月七日给他的亲密战友林彪同志的一封信，号召我们，人民解放军应该是一个大学校，除打仗以外，还可做各种工作。要学政治，学军事，学文化。要随时参加批判资产阶级的文化革命斗争。要把军学、军农、军工、军民这几项都兼起来，同时号召工厂、农村、学校、商业、服务行业和党政机关都应该成为革命化的大学校。毛主席这个指示，具有伟大的历史意义和战略意义。这个指示，是我军建设的永恒指针，也是巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的根本措施，是建设社会主义、逐步过渡到共产主义的宏伟纲领。这个指示，总结了我国和国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，它的整个思想，是马克思列宁主义划时代的新发展，是科学共产主义理论的新高峰。
    人民解放军是我们伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造的。早在我军创建初期，毛主席就明确指出，我军决不是单纯地打仗的，而是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。后来，毛主席又为我军规定了打仗、做群众工作、生产三大任务。他指出，我军永远是一个战斗队，同时又是一个工作队，一个生产队。人民解放军应该是一个大学校的伟大号召，是毛主席一贯的建军思想在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时期的新发展，把无产阶级建军的理论提高到一个崭新的阶段。遵照毛主席的光辉的建军思想去做，就能把我军办成毛泽东思想大学校。
    伟大领袖毛主席决定我军支援地方无产阶级文化大革命，执行支持左派广大群众，支援工业，支援农业，搞军管、军训，参加革命的“三结合”。这是极其光荣的任务，也是保证无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的一项英明决策，同时又是全面贯彻“五·七”指示，把全国全军办成革命化大学校的一项重大措施。
    支援地方无产阶级文化大革命，使我军办好毛泽东思想大学校有了更丰富的内容，更生动、更实际的课堂。阶级斗争的实践就是我们最好的政治课，广大的革命群众就是我们最好的老师，我们就是要在当前支左、支工、支农的火热斗争中，坚决执行毛主席的“五·七”指示，把学习最伟大的毛泽东思想同最丰富的实际斗争结合起来，把毛泽东思想的大学校办得更好。
    毛主席教导我们：“军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”过去，中国人民在毛主席的统帅下，主要是依靠军队夺取了政权。今天，还是要依靠军队保持和巩固无产阶级政权。我们军队是无产阶级专政的柱石，不仅要对付帝国主义、现代修正主义和它的走狗从外部来推翻我们的政权，而且要特别警惕和防止修正主义从内部篡夺党和国家的领导权，实行资本主义复辟。因此，我们军队不但要能打仗，而且还要学会同资产阶级，同党内走资本主义道路的当权派，同修正主义分子作尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，学会运用无产阶级专政下的大民主，放手发动广大群众，同无产阶级革命派一起，自下而上向党内走资本主义道路当权派夺权，并且掌好权，用好权。
    毛主席教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”林彪同志指出：“汹涌澎湃的群众运动，又总是反过来大大鼓舞和教育了军队，成为锻炼和提高军队政治觉悟的革命熔炉。”我军广大指战员在支左、支工、支农的火热的阶级斗争中去办毛泽东思想的大学校，就能经风雨，见世面，真正把毛泽东思想学到手。成千成万的共产主义新人，就能在这个大学校里，迅速地成长起来。
    毛泽东思想就是要搞阶级斗争，搞无产阶级专政。我们投身到支左、支工、支农的火热的阶级斗争中去，才能进一步领会毛泽东思想的本质，提高阶级斗争观念，善于在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中分清敌我，明辨是非，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向。我们要在游泳中学会游泳，在当前的阶级斗争中学会为无产阶级夺权、掌权、用权的本领。
    相信群众，依靠群众，是毛泽东思想的一个根本原理。树立坚强的群众观点，正确对待群众，是我军思想建设的一个根本内容。我们投身到规模宏伟的革命群众运动中去，才能认识到“群众是真正的英雄”，才能树立坚强的相信群众、依靠群众的观点，才能深刻理解毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，同时也是人们头脑中两种世界观的大搏斗。火热的阶级斗争中，矛盾最尖锐，斗争最激烈，最能触及人们的灵魂，对每一个人都是严峻的考验。我们投身到这个斗争中去，就能够更好地破私立公，更有成效地改造世界观，加速思想革命化。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，明目张胆地鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，提倡什么关门“修养”，妄图叫我们脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离政治，脱离革命，不关心国家大事，忘记无产阶级的政权。这是和毛主席“五·七”指示的精神完全背道而驰的。我们必须彻底批判《修养》，必须反其道而行之。
    目前，正处在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻。在全国范围内，正在掀起一个向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命的大批判群众运动。这是当前阶级斗争的中心课题。我军各级领导和广大干部战士，要进一步学习毛主席关于把全国全军办成革命化大学校的伟大指示，更加自觉地贯彻执行这个指示，把支左斗争同部队建设紧密地结合起来，把支左斗争的过程作为部队革命化建设的过程。我们要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中，在执行支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣任务中，在火热的阶级斗争中，把毛泽东思想的大学校办得更好。
                                        （五月七日）
