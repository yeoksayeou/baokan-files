The people of the Soviet Union, under the dark rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, although they cannot fully express their admiration for the great leader of the Chinese and world peoples, Chairman Mao, we can still hear many moving examples of Soviet people's love for Chairman Mao.

A young Soviet worker affectionately touched the Mao badge worn by a Chinese comrade on his chest and firmly said, "Mao Zedong is our Lenin!" These words are filled with boundless love for Chairman Mao, boundless respect for Mao Zedong Thought, boundless longing for socialist China, and boundless confidence in the future of the world revolution. These words express the sentiments of countless Soviet people and contain immense power!

The Soviet revisionist leadership has betrayed Lenin and Leninism. It is our great leader Chairman Mao who has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and also the red sun in the hearts of the world's people. The world revolution today, with the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding light, is the greatest happiness for all the people of the world.

The Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat has sounded the alarm, and Mao Zedong Thought has spread more widely throughout the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership is terrified and is doing everything in its power to attack the Chinese Cultural Revolution and slander the great Mao Zedong Thought. However, truth cannot be attacked and cannot be suppressed. Through the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the Soviet people have come to recognize even more the brilliance of Chairman Mao and the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, and they love and admire Chairman Mao even more, eagerly seeking to learn and master Mao Zedong Thought.

In the Soviet Union, the Soviet revisionist leadership is only a small clique, while the vast majority of the Soviet people are the victims of revisionist rule. Good people are always in the majority. The deception and suppression of the Soviet people by the Soviet revisionist leadership will ultimately be thoroughly bankrupt. The bourgeois dictatorship established by them in the Soviet Union will surely be overthrown by the Soviet people. The sunlight of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought will surely dispel the clouds of revisionism, bringing light back to the Soviet land!

    阳光必将驱散乌云
    在苏修领导集团黑暗统治下的苏联人民，虽然不能尽情表达他们对中国人民和世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的爱戴之情，但是，我们还是可以听到许多苏联人民热爱毛主席的感人事例。
    一位年轻的苏联工人亲切地抚摸着中国同志胸前佩戴的毛主席像章，坚定地说：“毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”这句话，充满了对毛主席的无限热爱，对毛泽东思想的无限敬仰，对社会主义中国的无限向往，对世界革命前途的无限信心。这句话，表达了多少苏联人民的心声，蕴藏着多么强大的力量！
    苏修领导集团背叛了列宁，背叛了列宁主义。是我们伟大领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛主席是中国人民心中的红太阳，也是世界人民心中的红太阳。当代的世界革命，有天才的毛主席作导师，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指路明灯，这是全世界人民的最大幸福。
    中国无产阶级文化大革命一声炮响，毛泽东思想在全世界得到更广泛的传播。苏修领导集团怕得要死，竭尽全力攻击中国文化大革命，污蔑伟大的毛泽东思想。但是，真理是攻不倒的，也是封锁不住的。苏联人民通过中国文化大革命，更加认识到毛主席的英明伟大，认识到毛泽东思想的无比威力，更加热爱和崇拜毛主席，迫切要求学习和掌握毛泽东思想。
    在苏联，苏修领导集团只是一小撮，而广大的苏联人民则是修正主义统治的受害者，好人总是占大多数。苏修领导集团对苏联人民的欺骗和镇压，终究要彻底破产的。他们在苏联建立的资产阶级特权阶层专政，必将被苏联人民所推翻。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阳光，一定会把修正主义的乌云驱散，使苏联的大地重新获得光明！
