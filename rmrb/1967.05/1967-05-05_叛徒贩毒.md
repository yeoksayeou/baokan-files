    Traitorous Drug Pushing

    Marx said, “Religion is the opium of the people.” However, the Soviet revisionist leadership group, which cloaks itself in “Marxism-Leninism,” has openly started peddling this drug. They recently compiled a book of “Bible Stories” specifically for Soviet children, aiming to poison the next generation of the Soviet Union.

    It is no surprise that the Soviet revisionist group values the Bible. Like all reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist group's rule is based on the enslavement and exploitation of the people. Their revisionist line is one of opposing revolution and abolishing revolution, a line that seeks the restoration of capitalism. Therefore, they must use the ideology of the exploiting classes, including religious thought, as their tools. They need to use religion to numb and deceive the people, so as to maintain their “thrones” and facilitate their counter-revolutionary activities.

    The great traitor Khrushchev was accustomed to using the teachings of the Bible to defend his acts of betrayal and surrender to American imperialism, attempting to undermine the fighting spirit of the revolutionary people of the world. The Soviet revisionist leadership group, which has inherited the entire legacy of Khrushchev, is now eager to use the Bible to cultivate successors to their revisionist cause. Is this not a perfectly normal phenomenon?

    The Soviet revisionist group claims that their “Bible Stories” have “no religious tendencies.” This is merely sugarcoating the poison. They compile this book obviously to use the teachings of the Bible to propagate their revisionist “theories” and traitorous philosophy. When they tell the story of “Babylon,” it is merely to propagate the theory of class harmony, to make people forget about class and class struggle, and to find some basis for their “peaceful coexistence” general line. When they tell the story of the “Noah’s Ark,” which Khrushchev loves so much, it is merely to propagate the nonsense that humanity is doomed, to advise people not to oppose imperialism but to “share the same boat” with imperialism. And so on. Their intentions are not entirely clear?

    We advise the gentlemen in Moscow, if you are going to compile “Bible Stories,” you should include the story of Judas. If you tell the story of the traitor who betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver to the readers of the Soviet Union, it will certainly help the Soviet people recognize the shameful faces of you, this small group of traitors.

    叛徒贩毒
    马克思说过：“宗教是人民的鸦片。”然而披着“马克思列宁主义”外衣的苏修领导集团，竟公然贩卖起这种毒品来了。他们最近专门为苏联儿童编纂了一本《圣经故事》，来毒害苏联的下一代。
    苏修集团特别看中了《圣经》，是毫不奇怪的。同一切反动派一样，苏修集团的统治，是建立在奴役和剥削人民的基础上。他们推行的修正主义路线，是反对革命、取消革命的路线，是实行资本主义复辟的路线。因此，他们就必然要把剥削阶级的意识形态，包括宗教思想，作为自己的工具。他们需要利用宗教来麻痹和欺骗人民，以便于维持他们的“宝座”，并且便于进行他们的反革命活动。
    大叛徒赫鲁晓夫就是惯于搬用《圣经》的教义，为他向美帝国主义叛卖投降行为辩护，妄图瓦解世界革命人民的斗志。继承了赫鲁晓夫全套衣钵的苏修领导集团，现在热中于利用《圣经》来培养修正主义的接班人，这不是十分正常的现象吗？
    苏修集团表白说，他们编的《圣经故事》“没有任何宗教的倾向”。这不过是用糖衣来裹毒药。他们所以要编这本书，显然是为了借用《圣经》的教义，来宣扬他们的修正主义“理论”和叛徒哲学。他们讲《巴比塔》的故事，无非就是要宣传四海一家的阶级调和论，使人们忘记阶级和阶级斗争，为他们的“和平共处”总路线寻得一点根据。他们讲赫鲁晓夫最心爱的《诺亚方舟》的故事，无非就是要宣传什么人类要毁灭的鬼话，劝人们不要反对帝国主义，而要同帝国主义“同舟共济”。如此等等。他们的用心不是十分清楚的吗？
    我们奉劝莫斯科的老爷们，你们既然要编《圣经故事》，就应当把关于犹大的故事也编进去。如果把这个拿了三十块银币就出卖了耶稣的叛徒的故事告诉苏联的读者，这对于苏联人民认识你们这一小撮叛徒的可耻面目倒是会有帮助的。
