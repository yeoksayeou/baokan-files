The Red Sea region has seen a surge of anti-American fury. The people of Yemen have taken to the streets in angry protests, smashing the American spy agency.

The Yemeni government has announced the cancellation of all agreements signed with the U.S. "Agency for International Development."

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Taiz, the Yemeni newspaper *Republic* reported on April 30 that the government of the Arab Republic of Yemen issued a statement on April 27 announcing its decision to nullify all agreements signed with the U.S. "Agency for International Development." The statement condemns U.S. imperialism for engaging in subversive activities in Yemen through this agency.

The statement said that investigations have clearly shown that most of the sabotage activities in Yemen were orchestrated by the U.S. "Agency for International Development" in Yemen (i.e., the "Fourth Point Plan" office). The recent incident where the American personnel at this office fired rockets at the Taiz ammunition depot is a clear example.

The statement pointed out that rocket launchers, secret radio transmitters, and weapons were found in the "Fourth Point Plan" office camp in Taiz.

The statement said that on April 26, when the Yemeni people took to the streets to protest against the U.S. government, some American personnel at the "Fourth Point Plan" office fired at the protesters in front of the office.

The statement said that these facts show that the activities of the "Fourth Point Plan" office have undermined and threatened Yemen's national security. Therefore, the Yemeni government has decided:

(1) To nullify the agreement signed between Yemen and the U.S. on November 8, 1959, and to revoke the permission granted to the aircraft of the U.S. "Agency for International Development" to fly over Yemeni territory.

(2) All personnel of the "Agency for International Development" must immediately leave Yemen.

(3) According to Yemeni law, American personnel involved in espionage activities will be handed over to Yemeni judicial authorities for prosecution.

According to reports, on the night of April 25, two Americans fired four rocket launcher shells from the "Fourth Point Plan" office camp in Taiz at the Yemeni ammunition depot, injuring four Yemenis. These two Americans have been arrested by the Yemeni government.

The next day after this serious incident orchestrated by the U.S., about 5,000 Yemenis held a large-scale protest march in Taiz. The angry protesters shouted in front of the U.S. Embassy and the "Fourth Point Plan" office: "Down with U.S. imperialism! U.S. imperialism out of Yemen!" Later, the protesters stormed the U.S. Embassy, tore down the American flag, and shredded it. They then stormed the "Fourth Point Plan" office, smashed all the windows, and dragged out the furniture to burn. They also destroyed four American cars. The protest lasted three and a half hours.

On April 27, the people of Taiz continued to hold a massive protest against U.S. imperialism. Students went on strike, and merchants closed their shops. On April 29, workers in Sana'a went on strike, and all shops were closed. These actions by the Yemeni people are a strong protest against the atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism in Yemen.

According to reports, on the morning of April 27, the U.S. chargé d'affaires in Yemen had the audacity to protest to the Yemeni government, demanding the release of the arrested Americans and compensation for the American agency. This U.S. imperialist diplomat even issued a so-called ultimatum, threatening that if the Yemeni government did not meet his demands within 24 hours, the U.S. government would withdraw its recognition of the Arab Republic of Yemen.

The arrogant and unreasonable ultimatum from U.S. imperialism was firmly rejected by President Sallal of Yemen. President Sallal convened a meeting of the National Defense Council on this matter. The meeting decided to continue the investigation and trial of those proven guilty, to stop the activities of the U.S. "Fourth Point Plan" office in Yemen, and to revoke the privileges enjoyed by American aircraft.

President Sallal told reporters: "We reject any ultimatum from anyone, and we decide that the investigation should proceed as usual." Sallal emphasized: "Whether the U.S. recognizes the Arab Republic of Yemen is the U.S. government's business, but maintaining Yemen's dignity and independence is the business of the Yemeni government."

    也门人民愤怒示威　砸烂美国间谍机构
    也门政府宣布废除同美国“国际开发署”签订的一切协定
    据新华社塔伊兹电  据也门《共和国报》四月三十日报道，阿拉伯也门共和国政府四月二十七日发表声明宣布，也门政府决定废除它同美国“国际开发署”签订的一切协定，谴责美帝国主义通过这个机构在也门进行颠覆活动。
    声明说，根据调查，事情已经十分清楚，在也门发生的大部分破坏活动，是美国“国际开发署”在也门的机构（即“第四点计划”办事处）在幕后策划的。最近，塔伊兹的军火库遭到这个机构的美国人用火箭筒轰击事件便是一个证明。
    声明指出，已经在塔伊兹的美国“第四点计划”办事处营地里搜出火箭筒弹、秘密无线电收发报机和武器。
    声明说，四月二十六日，也门人民为此举行游行示威向美国政府表示抗议时，美国“第四点计划”办事处的一些美国人竟在这个办事处前面向示威者开枪。
    声明说，种种事实表明，美国“第四点计划”办事处所进行的种种活动破坏了并且威胁着也门的国家安全，因此也门政府决定：（一）废除也门和美国在一九五九年十一月八日签订的协定，取消给予美国“国际开发署”的飞机在也门境内飞行的许可。（二）“国际开发署”的工作人员必须立即离开也门。（三）根据也门法律，进行间谍活动的美国有关人员将交给也门司法当局处理。
    据报道，在四月二十五日夜间，两个美国人从塔伊兹的美国“第四点计划”办事处营地里向也门军火库发射了四枚火箭筒弹，当即有四名也门人被打伤。这两个美国人已被也门政府逮捕。
    美国制造的这个严重破坏事件发生后的第二天，大约五千也门人在塔伊兹举行了大规模的抗议示威游行。愤怒的示威群众在美国大使馆和“第四点计划”办事处前面高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“美帝国主义从也门滚出去！”后来示威者冲进美国大使馆，扯下美国星条旗，并把它撕得粉碎。他们又冲进“第四点计划”办事处，砸碎所有窗玻璃，把家具搬出来，投到火里去。他们还毁坏了四辆美国汽车。示威历时三个半小时。
    四月二十七日，塔伊兹人民继续举行反对美帝国主义的声势浩大的示威游行。学生举行总罢课，商人罢市。四月二十九日，萨那工人举行罢工，所有商店都关门。也门人民的这些行动，是对美帝国主义在也门犯下的暴行的强烈抗议。
    据报道，二十七日上午，美国驻也门的代办竟然厚颜无耻地向也门政府提出“抗议”，要求释放被捕的美国人，还要求给那个美国机构以“赔偿”。美帝国主义的这个外交官甚至气势汹汹地提出所谓最后口头通牒，说什么如果也门政府在二十四小时内不答应他的要求，美国政府将撤销它对阿拉伯也门共和国的承认。
    美帝国主义者的横蛮无理的最后通牒遭到也门总统萨拉勒的严正拒绝。萨拉勒总统就这件事召开了国防委员会会议。会议决定：继续进行调查和审讯已证明有罪的人，制止美国在也门的“第四点计划”办事处的活动和取消美国飞机所享有的特权。
    萨拉勒总统对新闻记者说：“我们拒绝任何人的最后通牒，并且决定，调查应当照常进行。”萨拉勒强调说：“美国承认不承认阿拉伯也门共和国只是美国政府的事，但是维护也门的尊严和独立是也门政府的大事。”
