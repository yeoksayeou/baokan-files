    Why is the production reform work at Fengfeng Coal Mine progressing slowly?

    To the Editor: The engineering and technical personnel of Fengfeng Coal Mine have serious conservative ideas in promoting mechanized new coal mining methods, so that the mine's production reform has been slow for two years and has not completed its production tasks.

    In the first half of this year, the first mine only completed 67.58 percent of the new coal mining task; the second mine completed 94.2 percent, but the coal mining efficiency per worker was only less than 47 percent of the original task, and the timber consumption per ton was more than 40 percent higher than the quota. A particularly serious problem is that some technical personnel do not seriously study the reasons for not completing the task, but mistakenly believe that "new coal mining methods have low efficiency and high costs, and are not as fast and economical as old methods." In fact, how do they treat new coal mining methods?

    Last year, a new coal cutting machine was transferred to the first section of the second mine. At the beginning of this year, it was only used a few times before being stored in the warehouse, on the grounds that it encountered faults and the roof was not good, so they dared not continue to use it. In August this year, Luo Yongjin, a model worker of the mine, heard during his vacation in Beidaihe that other coal mines could use coal cutting machines under natural conditions worse than those of Fengfeng Mine. After returning to the mine, he asked to try the coal cutting machine in his work group. Although the mine leaders and engineers expressed "active support," none of the engineering and technical personnel really helped them overcome the difficulties. Therefore, although the coal cutting machine was sent down the well, it had to be left idle in the main roadway, starting the motor once a day to prevent the machine from getting damp and rusty. The workers said: "This lazy thing is so delicate that it has to be fed with electricity every day even when it doesn't work."

    The mine began to use pneumatic picks in 1950, and Luo Yongjin was the model worker who created a new record for pneumatic pick coal mining. But even now, in another team next to Luo Yongjin's team's mining area, the pneumatic pick is stuck in the coal pile and no one uses it, and the workers are all using hand picks to dig coal. The mine's technical personnel do not mind this and say: "This is because they are afraid that the noise of the pneumatic pick is too loud, and they will not be able to hear if there is a problem with the roof."

    In March 1950, the mine began to try the "dense support" method recommended by Soviet experts to replace the old "wooden piles" and "duckbill sheds" roof management method. However, the mine did not strictly implement the operating procedures in the trial implementation. According to the operating regulations, coal should be extracted once, the support should be withdrawn, and the roof should be released once; but the workers often do not withdraw all the supports or do not do a good job of releasing the roof, and then continue to extract coal, so that the roof pressure is too high, the support recovery rate is reduced, and the coal output is affected. Some leaders and technical personnel of the mine turned a blind eye to this and did not promptly educate the workers to strictly implement the operating procedures, but instead said that "the new coal mining method has low efficiency and high costs."

    Although the mine has changed most of the working faces of the four mines to the new coal mining method of "downward, collapse, longwall, and layered" under the supervision of the superior, some leaders and technical personnel still cannot understand the idea, and they attribute the reason for the failure to complete the production task to the new coal mining method. They said: "Last year's production task was also very tight, but the output increased quickly as soon as we worked harder; why can't it be increased this year? Because we are using the new method this year." What kind of method is the "old method" they miss with such deep feelings? That is the "residual pillar high fall coal mining method" that only cares about the present and not the future, and mines coal whenever it is seen and uses holes indiscriminately. This method can only extract 50 to 60 percent of the coal seam at most (the new method can extract more than 90 percent). Last year, one working face of the first mine originally had the conditions for mining with the new method, but because the old method was used, only 36,400 tons were extracted from the 85,800 tons of coal seam; if the new method was used, with a recovery rate of 80 percent, more than 68,000 tons could be extracted.

    Although the leaders and engineering and technical personnel of Fengfeng Coal Mine have not openly resisted the promotion of new coal mining methods, this passive attitude is intolerable. This shows that they have not yet freed themselves from the quagmire of conservative thinking. Xiang Minzhi

    Editor's note: Fengfeng Coal Mine has had some success in restoring production in the past. However, in the past two years, the production reform work of promoting mechanized new coal mining methods has lagged far behind the requirements. Reader Xiang Minzhi's opinion is very correct, and the main obstacle to the production reform of Fengfeng Coal Mine is conservative thinking.

    But what is particularly noteworthy is that some leaders of the mine have even been captured by the technical personnel's cries of "objective difficulties." This shows that they do not understand that the process of promoting advanced production methods is the process of fighting against backward conservative thinking, and thus abandoned the important responsibility of political leadership. They did not seriously study where the difficulties lie and the essence of the problem, to educate and help technical personnel overcome conservative thinking; they did not widely and deeply publicize the benefits of production reform among the workers, mobilize workers to actively participate, and train workers to be familiar with new operating techniques and tools, but adopted the bureaucratic attitude of "as long as coal is mined and the production task is completed, it can be done in any way." This is an intolerable mistake.

    We suggest that the Coal Mine Administration Bureau attach importance to this issue and take effective measures to help Fengfeng Coal Mine quickly promote the production reform work of mechanized new coal mining methods.

### 为什么峰峰煤矿的生产改革工作进行迟缓

    为什么峰峰煤矿的生产改革工作进行迟缓
    编辑同志：峰峰煤矿的工程技术人员，在推行机械化新法采煤中，有严重的保守思想，以致两年来该矿生产改革进行迟缓，没有完成生产任务。
    今年上半年，该矿第一矿仅完成新法采煤任务的百分之六十七点五八；第二矿虽完成百分之九十四点二，但每工采煤效率仅及原定任务的百分之四十七弱，坑木吨耗较定额高百分之四十强。尤其严重的问题，是有些技术人员并不认真研究没有完成任务的原因，反而错误地认为“新法采煤效率低、成本高，不如老法快捷、经济。”实际上，他们是怎样对待新法采煤呢？
    去年调到该矿第二矿一部新式割煤机，今年年初只试用了几次，便把它存到仓库里了，理由是遇到断层，顶板不好，不敢继续使用。今年八月间，该矿劳动模范罗永金在北戴河休养，听到别的煤矿在较峰峰矿更坏的自然条件下，都可以使用割煤机。他回矿后就要求在自己工作组里试用割煤机。该矿领导人和工程师虽表示“积极支持”，但却没有一个工程技术人员真正具体帮助他们克服困难。因此，割煤机虽然送下井去，只好闲放在大巷里，每天开动一次马达，以免机器受潮生锈。工人说：“这个懒物儿真娇嫩，不工作还要天天用电喂。”
    该矿从一九五○年就开始使用风镐，罗永金就是创造风镐采煤新纪录的劳动模范。但直到现在，在罗永金小组回采区旁的另一小组，风镐却插在煤堆中没人使用，工人都用手镐刨煤。该矿的技术人员对此并不介意地说：“这是因为怕风镐响声太大，顶板出了问题听不见。”
    一九五○年三月，该矿开始试行苏联专家建议的“密集支柱”法代替旧的“木垛”、“鸭嘴棚子”的顶板管理法。但该矿在试行中没有严格执行操作程序。按照操作规定，应当出煤一次，撤回支柱，放顶一次；但工人往往不将支柱撤完或放顶工作没作好，就继续出煤，以致使顶板压力太大，支柱回收率降低，影响出煤。该矿有些领导人及技术人员对此熟视无睹，没有及时教育工人严格执行操作程序，却反而说“新采煤法效率低，成本高。”
    该矿在上级督促下虽把四个矿场大部分工作面改为“下行、陷落、长壁、分层”的新采煤法。但还有些领导人和技术人员思想搞不通，他们把生产任务不能完成的原因归罪于新采煤法。他们说：“去年生产任务也是很紧，可是，一加劲产量就很快提上去了；今年为什么提不上去呢？因为今年采用新方法。”他们带着如此深厚的感情所怀恋的“旧法”是一种什么样的方法呢？那是只顾眼前，不管将来，见煤就采，乱用洞子的“残柱高落采煤法”。这种方法最高只能采出煤藏的百分之五十到六十
    （新法可以采出百分之九十以上）。去年该矿一矿一个工作面，本来有用新法开采的条件，但因使用了旧法，八万五千八百吨的煤藏只采出三万六千四百吨；如用新法，以回采率百分之八十计算，也可采出六万八千多吨。
    峰峰煤矿领导人员及工程技术人员，虽然没有公开抗拒推行新法采煤，但这种消极应付的态度是不能令人容忍的。这说明他们还没有从保守思想的泥潭中解放出来。　项敏之
    编者按：峰峰煤矿过去在恢复生产上曾经有过一定的成绩。但两年来在推行机械化新采煤法的生产改革工作中，却远远落后于应有的要求。读者项敏之的意见很对，峰峰煤矿生产改革的主要障碍是保守思想。
    但特别值得我们注意的，是该矿某些领导人员竟然也为技术人员“客观困难”的叫喊所俘掳。这就说明他们还不了解：先进生产方法推广的过程，就是和落后的保守思想作斗争的过程，因而放弃了政治领导的重大责任。他们不去认真研究困难所在和本质问题，来教育和帮助技术人员克服保守思想；他们没有广泛而深入地在工人中宣传生产改革的好处，发动工人积极参加，并训练工人熟悉新的操作技术和工具，却采取了“只要采出煤来，完成生产任务，怎样做都可以”的官僚主义态度。这是不能容忍的错误。
    我们建议煤矿管理总局重视这个问题，采取有效的方法帮助峰峰煤矿迅速推进机械化新采煤法的生产改革工作。
