    Abide by Party and State Discipline
    ——September 2nd Pravda Editorial
    The Soviet people are marching towards the 19th Congress of the Lenin-Stalin Party with great and growing political and labor enthusiasm. Workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals are more broadly launching a socialist competition to complete and overfulfill the 1952 national economic plan.

    Our local party organizations, Communist Party members, and probationary members are at the forefront of this new patriotic upsurge among the masses. In these days leading up to the congress, the level of the party organizations' organizational and political work has significantly improved, and their leading role in all economic and cultural construction sectors has been strengthened.

    Party meetings and delegate conferences are discussing the draft directives of the Five-Year Plan and the draft amendments to the Party Constitution with a high degree of activity.

    Communist Party members unanimously support the articles of the draft Party Constitution that further consolidate the Party and its local organizations and elevate the great title of Communist Party member. All actions and thoughts of a Communist Party member are aimed at fulfilling the lofty obligations entrusted to them: to do their utmost to safeguard the unity of the Party, actively fight for the implementation of the Party's resolutions, play a model role in labor, constantly strengthen ties with the masses, master the principles of Marxism-Leninism, carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, be loyal and honest to the Party, abide by Party and state discipline, heighten vigilance, and resolutely implement the Party's instructions on the correct selection of cadres.

    The draft's requirement that Party members abide by Party and state discipline (which all members must equally obey) has been met with the warmest response from Party members. Communist Party members unanimously agree with the article in the draft that there cannot be two kinds of discipline within the Party—one for leaders and another for ordinary members. For all Communist Party members, regardless of their merits and positions, the Party has only one discipline and one law. Violating Party and state discipline is a serious crime that harms the Party and is therefore incompatible with the status of a Party member.

    Since the earliest days of its existence, our Party has been closely linked with unity of will, unity of action, and unity of discipline. When laying the organizational foundation of the Party, Lenin and Stalin emphasized that if the Party is to maintain the unity of its ranks, it must implement in its practice a unified proletarian discipline, a discipline that all members—leaders and ordinary members alike—must equally obey. Therefore, there should be no distinction within the Party between "superiors" who do not have to abide by discipline and "inferiors" who must obey discipline. Without this condition, it is impossible to maintain the integrity of the Party and the unity of its ranks.

    The Party tirelessly educates our cadres and all Communist Party members in the spirit of loyalty to the great cause of communism and in the spirit of resolutely implementing the Party's resolutions. Thanks to the Party's great educational work, the ideological level of Communist Party members is constantly improving, and their awareness is constantly growing. For the millions of Party members united by our Party, there is no interest higher than the interests of the Party and the interests of the socialist state.

    However, there are still some Communist Party members who mistakenly believe that there are two kinds of discipline in our Party—one for ordinary members and another for leaders. This non-Party, bureaucratic understanding of discipline leads individual Party members to fail to fulfill the important obligations entrusted to them, to become detached from the Party masses, to suppress criticism, and to violate Party and Soviet state laws.

    In discussing the tasks facing party organizations due to the convocation of the 19th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Party members severely criticized individual leaders who disregarded Party and state discipline, demanding that Party committees wage a resolute struggle against those who do not value the honor and status of a Communist Party member, who are not loyal and honest to the Party and the state, and who tolerate concealment and distortion of the truth.

    Communist Party members of the North Caucasus Railway Administration justly criticized the Party committee of the administration at the Party meeting because it did not promptly condemn the intolerable behavior of Comrade Kotlyarenko, director of the Rostov Railway Branch, who is also a Communist Party member. Kotlyarenko actually deceived the state by adopting incorrect and fraudulent classifications for vehicle repairs. After receiving reports about Kotlyarenko's violation of state laws, the Party committee did not give it due attention but continued to tolerate the non-Party behavior of the state discipline violator.

    Unfortunately, such incidents are not isolated cases. At the Party Congress of Nizhny Tagil City, delegates criticized the city Party committee because it did not give necessary attention to educating cadres in the spirit of strictly abiding by discipline in its practical work. Some time ago, deceivers who falsely filled out registration forms without meeting the product plan were exposed at the New Tagil Metallurgical Plant. With the tacit consent of the city Party committee, some of the deceivers have not yet been subjected to Party punishment. At the same time, the situation of material registration in the factory is still not good, and the factory has suffered huge losses due to the production of defective products, and there is waste in raw materials, fuel, and other materials. The factory has not achieved rhythmic work, the monetary accumulation plan has not been completed, and advanced labor methods have been adopted poorly.

    In order to educate cadres in the spirit of strictly abiding by discipline, local Party organizations should set an example of tireless struggle to complete the tasks of the Party and the state. The lack of a constant struggle to realize the resolutions of the superior organs and the resolutions of their own organs cannot be regarded as anything other than a serious violation of discipline. At the district and city Party congresses currently being held, Communist Party members resolutely criticized those Party leaders who have not ensured the implementation of the Party's important resolutions. At the Party Congress of the Kazankovsky District of Nikolaev Oblast, delegates criticized the district Party committee because it has not yet well implemented the Party's instructions on transforming the Party's organizational and political work, and on correctly combining political and economic work.

    The struggle to unswervingly abide by Party and state discipline requires the utmost effort to carry out self-criticism and criticism from below. Party members must expose shortcomings in their work and eliminate them, and oppose complacency and being blinded by achievements in their work. Suppressing criticism is a serious evil. Anyone who stifles criticism and replaces it with boasting and flattery cannot remain in the ranks of the Party.

    No matter what position a Party member holds, he should strictly demand of himself and others, and take an irreconcilable attitude towards shortcomings. His task, as stated in the draft amendment to the Party Constitution, is to report shortcomings in his work to the Party's leading organs up to the Party's Central Committee, regardless of who the report involves. A Party member has no right to conceal unsatisfactory situations and to ignore incorrect actions that harm the interests of the Party and the state. Anyone who hinders a Party member from fulfilling this obligation should be severely punished as a person who violates the will of the Party.

    One of the most important requirements of the draft amendment to the Party Constitution, which has been widely approved by Party members, is that Party members must keep Party and state secrets, maintain political vigilance, and always remember that Communist Party members must be vigilant at all times and under all circumstances. Leaking Party and state secrets is a crime against the Party and is therefore incompatible with the status of a Party member. Strict fulfillment of this obligation by every Communist Party member is a necessary condition for further consolidating Party and state discipline.

    Under the high political and labor enthusiasm of the masses, the Communist Party is marching towards its 19th Congress. Millions of Party members, with a just sense of pride in their great Party and the Party's world-historic achievements, are fighting with self-sacrificing spirit for new achievements in all sectors of economic and cultural construction. The title of the Party member of the Lenin-Stalin Party, which has led our country from victory to victory, is being raised higher and higher in the minds of the Soviet people and the working people of the world.

    遵守党和国家的纪律
    ——九月二日苏联真理报社论
    苏联人民正怀着巨大的、增长着的政治和劳动热情走向列宁—斯大林党的第十九次代表大会。工人、集体农民、知识分子更为广泛地展开了为完成和超额完成一九五二年国民经济计划的社会主义竞赛。
    我们的地方党组织、共产党员和候补党员走在群众的新的爱国主义高涨的前列。在代表大会前的这些日子里，党组织的党的组织工作和党的政治工作水平显著提高了，它们在一切经济和文化建设部门的领导作用增强了。
    党的会议和代表会议在高度积极性的情况下进行着对五年计划指示草案和党章修正草案的讨论。
    共产党员们一致赞成进一步巩固党和党的地方组织、提高共产党员的伟大称号的党章草案的条款。共产党员的一切行动和思想都是为着履行所付托于党员的崇高的义务：尽力护卫党的统一，积极为实现党的决议而斗争，在劳动中起模范作用，经常巩固与群众的联系，精通马克思列宁主义的原则，开展自我批评和自下而上的批评，对党忠诚老实，遵守党和国家的纪律，提高警惕性，坚决执行党关于正确选拔干部的指示。
    草案中对党员遵守党和国家纪律的要求（一切党员都必须同样遵守），受到了党员群众最热烈的响应。共产党员一致赞同草案中的这一条，即党内不能有两种纪律——一种对领导人的纪律，另一种对普通党员的纪律。对于所有的共产党员，不管他的功绩和职位如何，党只有一个纪律、一个法律。破坏党和国家的纪律，是损害党的严重罪恶，因而是与党员的身份不相容的。
    我党自其存在的最初的日子起，就和意志的统一、行动的统一、纪律的统一紧紧地结合着。列宁和斯大林在奠定党的组织基础时，强调指出说，党如果要保持自己队伍的统一，就应当在其实践中执行统一的无产阶级的纪律，一切党员——领导者和普通党员都须同样遵守的纪律。所以党内不应区分为不必遵守纪律的“上等人”和必须服从纪律的“下等人”。没有这种条件，就不可能保持党的完整性和党的队伍的统一。
    党不倦地以忠诚于共产主义伟大事业的精神、以坚决执行党的决议的精神教育我们的干部和全体共产党员。由于党的巨大的教育工作，共产党员的思想水平不断提高，他们的觉悟不断增长。对于为我党所团结起来的数百万党员来说，再没有比党的利益、比社会主义国家的利益更高的利益了。
    然而，现在仍有些共产党员错误地认为：好像在我们党内有两种纪律——一种是对普通党员的纪律，另一种是对领导人的纪律。这种对纪律的非党的、老爷式的理解，使得个别党员不履行付托于党员的重要的义务，脱离党员群众，压制批评，破坏党和苏维埃国家的法律。
    在讨论由于联共（布）党第十九次代表大会的召开党组织所面临的任务时，党员群众对于轻视党和国家纪律的个别领导人进行了严厉的批评，要求党委会与不重视共产党员的荣誉和身份、对党和国家不忠诚老实、容忍掩盖和歪曲真理的人们作坚决的斗争。
    北高加索铁路管理局的共产党员们，在党的会议上公正地批评了管理局的党委会，因为它没有及时地指责罗斯托夫铁路分局局长、共产党员柯特拉连科的不能容忍的行为。柯特拉连科竟欺骗国家，采用错误的、欺骗的车辆修理的分类。党委会在接到关于柯特拉连科的违反国家的行为的报告后，并没有给予应有的注意，而继续容忍国家纪律破坏者的非党行为。
    可惜，这种事件并不是例外。在下塔吉斯克市党的代表会议上，代表们批评了党的市委会，因为市委会在其实际工作中对于以严格遵守纪律的精神教育干部，没有给予必要的注意。一些时候以前，在新塔吉斯克冶金工厂揭发了没有达到产品计划而虚填登记表的欺骗者。在市委会的默然同意下，欺骗者中有些人至今还没有受到党的处罚。同时，直到现在该工厂的物资登记的情况是不好的，该厂由于出产废品而有巨大的损失，原料、燃料及其他材料上有着浪费。工厂没有达到有节奏的工作，货币积累计划没有完成，先进劳动方法采用得很差。
    为要以严格遵守纪律的精神教育干部，地方党组织应当树立为完成党的和国家的任务而进行不倦的斗争的范例。缺乏为实现上级机关决议和本机关决议的经常的斗争，不能看作其他，而是严重的破坏纪律。在目前举行的区和城市党代表会议上，共产党员们坚决地指责了那些没有保证实现党的重要决议的党的领导者。在尼古拉也夫州卡桑可夫斯克区党代表会议上，代表们批评了区党委会，因为它至今没有很好地执行党关于转变党的组织工作和党的政治工作的指示，关于正确结合政治和经济工作的指示。
    为坚持不渝地遵守党和国家纪律的斗争，需要尽力开展自我批评和自下而上的批评。党员必须揭露工作中的缺点和消灭缺点，反对骄傲自满的情绪，反对由于工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。压制批评是严重的恶行。凡是窒息批评而以夸夸其谈、阿谀奉承代替批评的人，都不能留在党的队伍里。
    党员不论在什么工作岗位上，都应当严格要求自己和别人，对缺点采取不调和态度。他的任务，党章修正案中说，——是向党的领导机关直至党的中央委员会报告工作中的缺点，不管报告牵涉到什么人。党员无权隐瞒不能令人满意的情况和不过问损害党及国家的利益的不正确行动。凡是妨碍党员履行这项义务的人应作为违背党的意志的人而予以严惩。
    受到党员群众的普遍赞同的党章修正案的最重要要求之一是：党员必须保守党和国家的机密，保持政治警惕性，时时记得共产党员在任何时候、在任何情况下都必须保持警惕。泄露党和国家的机密，就是对党犯罪，因而是与党员的身份不相容的。每个共产党员严格履行这一义务，是进一步巩固党和国家纪律的必要条件。
    在群众的高度政治和劳动积极性下，共产党正走向它的第十九次代表大会。数百万党员带着对自己的伟大的党及党的全世界历史性的成就的正当的自豪感，正在以自我牺牲的精神为争取一切经济和文化建设部门的新成就而斗争着。引导我国从胜利走向胜利的列宁、斯大林党的党员的称号，在苏联人民及全世界劳动人民心目中被提得高而更高。
