Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang. A bumper harvest of crops has been achieved in various parts of northern Korea. According to estimates by ordinary farmers, this year's autumn harvest is expected to be 80% or more of a normal year. With the joy of a good harvest, the vast number of farmers are working intensively on harvesting and threshing. In many areas of northern Korea, early crops such as sorghum, millet, and corn have been harvested, and rice harvesting has begun in some areas.

During the process from sowing to harvesting, the vast number of farmers in the rear of Korea displayed unparalleled heroic and tenacious spirit. Under the slogans "Everything for the front, everything for victory!" and "The struggle for food is the struggle for the country!", they actively responded to the call of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government. Disregarding the bombing and strafing of American aerial bandits, they enthusiastically launched production increase campaigns and organized mutual assistance, thus overcoming the difficulties of insufficient labor, seeds, farm tools, and fertilizers. They victoriously completed the struggle against drought and flood, resulting in this year's bumper harvest. The Korean government's measures to provide loans of grain and seeds, and to reduce and exempt taxes in kind, as well as the vigorous assistance of the Chinese and Korean People's Army, were also important factors in the bumper harvest achieved by farmers in various parts of Korea.

In the agricultural production increase campaign, many new advanced farmers emerged in various places, and many new agricultural production experiences were created. Model female farmer Liu Wanyu of Luyue Township, Xinchuan County, Hwanghae Province, achieved outstanding results due to the adoption of advanced management methods. According to agricultural experts, the actual output of Liu Wanyu's paddy fields far exceeded the planned output. It is estimated that each hectare (equivalent to 15 Chinese mu) can harvest 19,250 kilograms of rice, setting a new record for rice field production. Liu Wanyu is 35 years old this year. During the period when the American-Li bandits temporarily occupied Xinchuan County, her husband and children, a family of fifteen, were all killed. She alone took on the labor of cultivating the 5,000 ping (approximately 24.5 Chinese mu) of paddy fields that her husband cultivated during his lifetime. Last year, she achieved a bumper harvest due to creative labor and made contributions to supporting the front lines, and was awarded the Republic's Third-Class National Flag Medal. This year, she has further accepted the experience of last year's bumper harvest, selected excellent seeds, thoroughly disinfected them before sowing, and diligently weeded and adjusted the water volume in the paddy fields. She also adopted advanced fertilization methods and used self-supplied fertilizer, all of which enabled her to achieve even better results than last year.

Despite the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in northern Korea by American aerial bandits, which destroyed large areas of farmland full of crops and killed many innocent farmers, the heroic and tenacious Korean farmers overcame various difficulties and achieved a victory in the bumper harvest, thereby alleviating the wartime food difficulties of the Korean people. Farmers in various places bitterly hate the atrocities of the American aggressors, and they are vying to select good grain, pay taxes in kind in advance, support the front lines, and more powerfully strike the American aggressors.

    朝鲜北部农作物丰收
    【新华社平壤电】朝鲜北部各地农作物普遍丰收。据一般农民估计，今年秋收年景可望在八成以上。广大农民正怀着丰收的喜悦心情，紧张地进行收割和打场。在朝鲜北部很多地区，高粱、谷子、玉米等早期作物已收割完毕，部分地区已开始收割稻禾。
    在从播种到收获的过程中，朝鲜后方的广大农民发挥了无比英勇顽强的精神。他们在“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利！”“为食粮的斗争就是为祖国的斗争！”的口号下，积极响应朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府的号召，不顾美国空中强盗的轰炸扫射，热烈展开增产竞赛运动，组织互助，这样终于克服了劳动力、种子、农具、肥料不足的困难，胜利地完成了抗旱抗涝的斗争，使今年得到了丰收。朝鲜政府贷粮、贷种与减免现物税的措施以及中朝人民军队的大力协助，也是朝鲜各地农民得到丰收的重要因素。
    在农业增产竞赛运动中，各地涌现出很多新的先进农民，创造了很多新的农业生产经验。黄海道信川郡芦月面的模范女农民柳万玉因为采用先进的经营方法，获得了突出的成绩。据农业专家评定，柳万玉的稻田的实际生产量远远地超过了计划生产量，预计每公顷（合十五市亩）可收获稻子一万九千二百五十公斤，创造了稻田生产的新纪录。柳万玉今年三十五岁，在美李匪军暂时侵占信川郡期间，她的丈夫和子女等一家十五人全被杀害。她一个人担当起了耕种她丈夫生前所耕种的五千坪（约合二十四市亩半）稻田的劳动。在去年，她由于创造性的劳动而获得丰收，在支援前线的工作上也立了功，因而荣获共和国的三级国旗勋章。今年，她更接受去年的丰收的经验，选择优良种子，彻底消毒后播种，并经常在稻田里辛勤地锄草、调剂水量，又采用了先进的施肥方法，使用自给肥料，这一切使她获得了比去年更优良的成绩。
    尽管美国空中强盗对朝鲜北部和平城乡狂轰滥炸，破坏了大片长满庄稼的田地，杀害了许多无辜农民，英勇顽强的朝鲜农民还是战胜了各种困难，取得了丰收的胜利，从而减轻了朝鲜人民的战时粮食困难。各地农民切齿痛恨美国侵略者的暴行，他们正争先地挑选好粮食，提前缴纳现物税，支援前线，更有力地打击美国侵略者。
