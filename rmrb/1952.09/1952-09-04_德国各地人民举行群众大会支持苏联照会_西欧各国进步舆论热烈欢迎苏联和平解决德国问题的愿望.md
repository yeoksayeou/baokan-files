Xinhua News Agency, Second Dispatch: The German people, responding to the call of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the German Communist Party, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany, have begun to take active steps to support the Soviet government's proposal in its August 23 note to Western countries to convene a four-power conference.

According to TASS: In the German Democratic Republic, more than 200,000 residents of Leipzig held a grand rally in "Karl Marx Square," demanding that the four powers immediately negotiate a peace treaty with Germany and withdraw all occupying forces, based on the Soviet government's proposal. In Chemnitz, a mass rally of 90,000 people was held under the slogan: "Down with the Bonn War Treaty! The four powers must immediately hold negotiations to discuss a peaceful resolution of the German question." A rally of 20,000 people was also held in Rostock. Residents throughout the German Democratic Republic are protesting the Bonn War Treaty and demanding a peace treaty with a unified Germany.

In West Germany, 1,500 metalworkers in Nuremberg passed a resolution stating: The Soviet note "meets the needs of our people. Therefore, we, the employees of the Nuremberg Metal Factory, advise the government of the Federal Republic to carefully study the recent note from the Soviet government. Let the Bonn government remember: The German people will soon settle accounts with it for the anti-national measures it has taken, and that day will not be long in coming." The resolution specifically pointed out the need to use all means to fight against the Bonn split "treaty," against anti-labor laws, and against the rearmament of West Germany. The "Association for the Defense of European Peace" also held a mass rally in Frankfurt am Main, demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany as soon as possible.

The total number of West German people who have voted demanding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and opposing the "General Treaty" has now reached 8,245,720.

Xinhua News Agency, First Dispatch: According to TASS: Progressive newspapers in Western European capitalist countries have warmly welcomed the Soviet government's August 23 note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany.

The French "l'Humanité" published an article by Godard, stating: "The Soviet government's response to the recent note from Western countries on the German question once again proves that the Soviet Union is willing to seek a peaceful resolution of the German question. This note, whether in the part refuting the other party or in the part proposing a four-power conference, is full of a desire to negotiate. This note considers the German question from the specific circumstances of the current situation. This note does not demand anything that the Western allies cannot agree to." "Libération" said: The Soviet note is an important document, "It shows how the Soviet government hopes to consult with Paris, London, and Washington in order to resolve the German question as soon as possible."

The diplomatic correspondent of the London "Daily Worker" wrote: "The Soviet government's note provides a basis on which the German question can be resolved peacefully and the world can be saved from the terror that will be created by new German troops led by Hitler's generals."

Italian democratic newspapers, while publishing the new Soviet note, also emphasized that this note is another contribution to the peaceful resolution of the German question. "l'Unità" said: The Soviet proposal points out "the only possible way to truly ease the situation." The newspaper also pointed out: "If we consider that all Soviet documents on the German question consistently respect the German nation and its interests and independence, we will understand why the German people warmly welcome the Soviet note."

    德国各地人民举行群众大会支持苏联照会
    西欧各国进步舆论热烈欢迎苏联和平解决德国问题的愿望
    【新华社二日讯】德国人民响应德国统一社会党、德国共产党及民主德国全国阵线全国委员会的号召，已开始采取积极的行动，支持苏联政府八月二十三日致西方国家照会中所提出的召开四国会议的建议。
    据塔斯社讯：在德意志民主共和国，来比锡市有二十多万居民在“卡尔·马克思广场”举行了盛大的群众集会，要求四国立即根据苏联政府的建议，谈判对德和约和撤退所有占领军的问题。在开姆尼斯，举行了九万人的群众大会，大会的口号是：“打倒波恩战争条约！四国立即举行谈判，讨论和平解决德国问题。”在罗斯多克也举行了两万人参加的大会。德意志民主共和国全国各地的居民都在抗议波恩战争条约，要求与统一的德国缔结和约。
    在西德，纽伦堡一千五百名五金工人通过了一项决议。决议说：苏联照会“是合乎我国人民的需要的，因此，我们纽伦堡五金工厂的员工劝告联邦共和国政府，仔细地来研究苏联政府最近的照会。请波恩政府记住：德国人民很快就要和它算一算它所采取的反民族措施的账了，这个日子不要很久就会到来的”。决议特别指出有必要运用一切方法来进行反对波恩分裂“条约”、反对反劳工的法律和反对重新武装西德的斗争。“保卫欧洲和平协会”在美因河畔法兰克福也召开了一次群众大会，要求尽早与德国缔结和约。
    西德人民投票要求缔结对德和约，反对“一般性条约”的总人数现在已达到八百二十四万五千七百二十人。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社讯：西欧资本主义各国的进步报纸热烈欢迎苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会。
    法国“人道报”刊载了古达德的论文说：“苏联政府对西方国家最近关于德国问题的照会所提出的答复，再一次证明了苏联是愿意求得德国问题的和平解决的。这一个照会，无论在驳斥对方的部分或在关于举行四国会议的建议部分中，都充满了要谈判的愿望。这个照会是从目前局势的具体情况出发来考虑德国问题的。这个照会并没有要求西方盟国所不能答允的任何东西”。“解放报”说：苏联的照会是一个重要的文件，“它表明了苏联政府是如何地希望与巴黎、伦敦和华盛顿等方面进行商谈，俾得早日解决德国问题。”
    伦敦“工人日报”的外交记者写道：“苏联政府的照会提供了一种基础，在这种基础上可以和平解决德国问题并拯救世界脱离希特勒将军们所率领的新德国军队将制造的恐怖。”
    意大利民主报纸在刊出苏联新照会的同时，也强调这个照会对和平解决德国问题是又一贡献。“团结报”说：苏联的建议指出了“真正缓和局势的唯一可能的道路”。该报并指出：“如果我们考虑到苏联关于德国问题的所有文件一贯尊重德国民族及其利益与独立，我们就会明白，为什么德国人民热烈欢迎苏联的照会。”
