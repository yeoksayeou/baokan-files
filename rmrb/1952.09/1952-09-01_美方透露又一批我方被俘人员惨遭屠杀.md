Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, August 31st: While the American aggressors endlessly delay the Korean armistice talks at Panmunjom, they are continuously massacring our captured personnel in prisoner-of-war camps who resolutely demand repatriation. According to reports from American and British news agencies: From August 24th to 27th, another one of our captured personnel was beaten to death, and twenty-six were injured. Adding this to the previously disclosed information from the US side that five prisoners were killed and sixty-four were injured from August 11th to 23rd, in just seventeen days of August, six of our captured personnel have been killed and ninety injured.

According to the US side, from August 24th to 27th, our captured personnel were brutally murdered as follows: On the 24th, at the Masan prisoner-of-war camp, the US side forced our prisoners to perform dangerous labor, killing one and injuring another; on the 25th, at the 5th prisoner-of-war camp, the US military "accidentally" shot and wounded one prisoner; on the 26th, at the 11th compound of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, due to a "singing incident," the US military injured nine more prisoners; on the 27th, at the Koje Island F compound, the US military prohibited our captured personnel from singing, injuring fifteen prisoners. People know that the US side has consistently used news blockades to cover up its atrocities of massacring prisoners of war, and only after our continuous exposure of their crimes, they were forced to reveal some information about the prisoner-of-war camps. Therefore, behind the barrier of the US news blockade, how many of our captured personnel have been massacred is still a big question. However, even based on the scraps of material revealed by the US side, it can be seen what kind of abuse, persecution, and massacre our captured personnel, who resolutely demand repatriation, are subjected to in the US prisoner-of-war camps.

Before the US prisoner-of-war camp commander Boatner returned to the United States to serve as the deputy commander of the US Fourth Army for his meritorious service in massacring prisoners of war, he once again publicly lied, attempting to cover up the crime of massacring prisoners of war. He shamelessly attributed these massacres to "riots" caused by prisoners "opposing former prisoner leaders." However, the materials revealed by the US side itself exposed his lies. According to the situation released by the US military, many incidents since the 11th were merely due to prisoners singing "Communist songs," which were then "suppressed" by the US military guards, and all the victims were killed or injured by US military guns and bayonets. The captured personnel killed in Masan on the 24th were killed or injured by falling rocks while the US side violated the Geneva Convention and forced prisoners to perform dangerous hard labor. It is easy to see that the US massacre and abuse of our captured personnel is only because our captured personnel are brave and unyielding and resolutely demand to be repatriated home, which completely exposes the US's lie that our captured personnel do not want to be repatriated. Enraged, the American aggressors are therefore attempting to use massacres and abuse to eliminate and torture our captured personnel.

It is worth noting that while lying, the American executioner Boatner also said menacingly: "There will be new incidents in the future." This means that the US is determined to continue to massacre large numbers of our captured personnel who resolutely demand repatriation. This cowardly and brutal behavior of the US side will only aggravate the crimes they must be responsible for; and will never help them achieve their shameful goal of detaining prisoners of war.

### 美方透露又一批我方被俘人员惨遭屠杀

    美方透露又一批我方被俘人员惨遭屠杀
    【新华社开城三十一日电】美国侵略者一方面在板门店无休止地拖延朝鲜停战谈判，同时，连续在战俘营内屠杀坚决要求遣返的我方被俘人员。据美、英通讯社透露：从八月二十四日到二十七日，又有我方被俘人员一名被打死，二十六名被打伤。加上美方前所透露的自八月十一日到二十三日打死战俘五名、打伤六十四名，仅八月份的十七天内，我方被俘人员已被打死六名，打伤九十名。
    据美方透露，从二十四日到二十七日，我方被俘人员是这样惨遭毒手的：二十四日，在马山战俘营，美方强迫我方战俘担任危险劳动，并打死我方战俘一人，一人被打伤；二十五日，在第五战俘营美军又“无意”枪伤战俘一名；二十六日，在巨济岛战俘营第十一号营房，因“唱歌事件”，美军又打伤战俘九名；二十七日，在巨济岛F营场美军又禁止我方被俘人员唱歌打伤战俘十五名。人们知道：美方一贯利用新闻封锁来掩盖其屠杀战俘的暴行，只是在我方连续揭露其罪行之后，才不得不透露出一些战俘营的情形。因此，在美方新闻封锁的障壁后面，惨遭屠杀的我方被俘人员究竟有多少，还是一个很大的疑问。然而，即使根据美方透露的一鳞半爪的材料，也可以看出坚决要求遣返的我方战俘在美方战俘营中是在受着怎样的虐待、迫害和屠杀。
    美方战俘营长官波纳在他因屠杀战俘有功回国就任美国第四军副军长之前，又一次公开撒谎，妄想掩饰屠杀战俘的罪行。他无耻地把这些屠杀事件说成是俘虏“反对以前的俘虏领袖”所引起的“暴动”。但是，就是美方自己透露的材料揭穿了他的谎话。根据美国军方发表的情况，十一日以来的许多次事件都仅仅是由于战俘唱“共产党歌曲”，而遭到了美军警卫的“镇压”，所有被害的战俘都是在美军的枪弹刺刀下死伤的。二十四日在马山遇害的我方被俘人员，是在美方违背日内瓦公约强迫战俘进行的危险苦役中被坠岩打死打伤的。人们很容易看出：美方对我方被俘人员的屠杀和虐待，只是因为我方被俘人员英勇不屈、坚决要求遣返回家，这就完全拆穿了美方散布的所谓我方被俘人员不愿遣返的弥天大谎。恼羞成怒的美国侵略者因此企图用屠杀和虐待的手段来消灭和折磨我方被俘人员。
    值得注意的是：美国刽子手波纳在撒谎的同时，还杀气腾腾地说：“以后还会有新的事件。”这就是说美方决意继续大批屠杀坚决要求遣返的我方被俘人员。美方这种卑怯残暴的行为，只会加重他们必须负责的罪行；而绝不能帮助他们实现其扣留战俘的可耻目的。
