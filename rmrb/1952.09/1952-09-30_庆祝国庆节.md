    Celebrating National Day
    Nuclear Physicist Zhao Zhongyao
    It has only been three years since the birth of the People's Republic of China. Due to political progress, economic stability, and the rapid advancement of various construction undertakings, China has leaped to become an independent and democratic power. On this great National Day, we are all overjoyed to celebrate the glorious achievements of our motherland over the past three years, and to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for leading the revolution.
    With the completion of land reform, the peasants who had been oppressed by feudal landlords for thousands of years have completely turned over. This is a most celebrated event. It has raised the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the vast number of peasants, and prepared the necessary conditions for the country's industrialization. In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the Chinese People's Volunteers, with unparalleled heroism, drove the American invading army from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel, severely打击ing the aggressive plot of American imperialism, consolidating the national defense of the motherland, and strengthening the forces for world peace. The victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements this year eliminated the remnants of the old society and further consolidated the achievements of the people's revolution. The completion of the Huai River harnessing project, the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, and the emergence of countless labor models all prove the great strength and outstanding wisdom of the Chinese people.
    As a scientific worker, I particularly deeply appreciate the great significance of ideological remolding. The ideological remolding of intellectuals is one of the important conditions for the new China to realize democratic reform and gradually implement industrialization. Most of China's scientific workers come from the petty bourgeoisie and have been directly or indirectly influenced by capitalist education. Individualism, liberalism, and departmentalism are common among intellectuals, and they lack the spirit of serving the people and a high sense of responsibility. Although such scientists can solve some problems for the country and train a small number of technical cadres, the waste is serious, the work efficiency is low, and they cannot meet the needs of the new China's industrialization. In the past three years, scientific workers have gradually understood the significance of the Chinese revolution, appreciated the spirit of self-sacrifice of revolutionary cadres and the spirit of unselfishness of the working class, and witnessed the great achievements of the working people. All of them have criticized their past mistakes and gradually established the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly.
    Due to the transformation of their thinking, scientific workers have gradually overcome the bad habits of establishing their own factions and expanding their influence, first enabling the adjustment of research institutions and the unification of academic organizations to be realized, eliminating the waste and unnecessary friction of overlapping institutions in the past. This year, the adjustment of institutions of higher learning has been further implemented, greatly improving the efficiency of training specialized talents nationwide. This is the result of the initial improvement of intellectuals' thinking.
    If scientists are to serve the people, they must combine theory with practice. However, in the past, many scientific workers did not connect with reality because they were influenced by foreign academic education. At the same time, the industry in China in the past was a semi-colonial industry. Most of the machines were imported from foreign countries, and the management and technology were also controlled by foreigners. Under such circumstances, Chinese scientific workers were almost completely isolated from industrial production. Scientific workers could not easily find opportunities to contact reality, and could only shut themselves up and do some impractical work. Since science was not connected with reality, society naturally did not feel the need for science, so scientific work was not valued and supported by society. The new China is going all out for industrialization and needs science to provide the necessary knowledge and solve important problems. And because of the establishment of the concept of serving the people, scientific workers have understood the importance of combining theory with practice, and have made great achievements in agriculture, industry, and medicine. In the future, they will be able to play a greater role and increase the happiness of the people.
    What is especially important is that Chinese scientific workers have deeply understood the importance of absorbing the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and combining with the working people. The industrialization of the Soviet Union relies on the increased production and thrift of the working people, and we have the same situation. Absorbing the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can accelerate the progress of our industrialization. Since the past three years, the achievements in water conservancy projects and many industries have been powerful examples. Because scientists are combined with the working people, the working people can tell scientists their practical experience, and scientists use theory to conduct further research to improve production technology and develop production. The discovery of many ore deposits and the improvement of production in the new China are the result of such cooperation between scientific workers and the working people. Only on such a basis of cooperation can scientists and the working people play the greatest role, and only under the leadership of the working class is such cooperation possible.
    Because of the superior political conditions and the improvement of ideological level, scientific workers in the new China have also gradually established a correct outlook on life. In the past, the phenomena that Chinese scientific workers paid attention to were only limited to matter and biology, while neglecting the laws of history and social development. This was mostly due to the oppression of the reactionary rule, which made scientists afraid to face reality. At that time, if a scientist did not want to be used by the ruling class, he could only do some academic research. Therefore, his perspective was narrow and he could not have a correct outlook on life. But in the new China, scientific workers do not have to escape reality, they can understand the truth through practice and then transform the objective world.
    In the past three years, the people of the new China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are showing great strength, creating brilliant miracles, jointly building a happy new China, and becoming an important force in defending the Far East and world peace.

    庆祝国庆节
    原子核物理学家  赵忠尧
    中华人民共和国的诞生，于今不过三周年。因为政治进步，经济稳定，各项建设事业突飞猛进，中国已经一跃而为独立民主的强国。在这伟大的国庆节，我们莫不欢欣鼓舞，庆祝祖国三年来的辉煌成就，感谢领导革命的共产党和毛主席。
    由于土地改革的完成，几千年来受着封建地主压迫的农民，彻底翻身了。这是一件最可庆祝的大事。它提高了广大农民的政治觉悟和生产热情，为国家工业化准备了必要的条件。在抗美援朝运动中，人民志愿军以无比的英勇，把美国侵略军从鸭绿江边赶回三八线，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，巩固了祖国的国防，加强了世界和平的力量。今年“三反”“五反”运动的胜利，扫除了旧社会的遗毒，更进一步巩固了人民革命的成果。他如治淮工程、荆江分洪工程的完成，成渝铁路的通车，以及无数劳动模范的出现，无不证明中国人民伟大的力量和杰出的智慧。
    作为一个科学工作者，我特别深切地体会到思想改造的重大意义。知识分子的思想改造，为新中国实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化的重要条件之一。中国科学工作者，大部分出身小资产阶级，直接或间接地受过资本主义教育的影响。个人主义、自由主义、本位主义的思想作风，在知识分子中普遍地存在着，他们缺乏为人民服务的精神和高度的责任感。这样的科学家，虽然也可以替国家解决若干问题，训练少数技术干部，但是浪费严重，工作效率低，不能满足新中国工业化的需要。三年以来，科学工作者逐渐懂得了中国革命的意义，体会到革命干部自我牺牲的精神和工人阶级大公无私的精神，看到劳动人民的伟大成就，无不批判自己过去的错误，逐渐建立起全心全意为人民服务的观念。
    科学工作者由于思想的转变，逐步克服了各自建立门户和扩张势力的不良作风，首先使研究机关的调整和学术团体的统一得以实现，免去了过去机构重叠的浪费和无谓的摩擦。今年又进一步实行了高等学校的调整，使全国训练专门人材的效率大大提高。这是知识分子思想初步提高的结果。
    科学家要为人民服务，必需把理论联系实际。但过去许多科学工作者因为受了国外学院式教育的影响，不联系实际。同时，从前中国的工业，系半殖民地的工业，机器大部从外国输入，管理和技术，也都由外人掌握，在这种情形下，中国科学工作者几乎完全与工业生产相隔离。科学工作者不容易找到接触实际的机会，只能关起门来，做些不切实际的工作。科学既不联系实际，社会自然不觉得有科学的需要，所以科学工作不受社会的重视和支持。新中国以全力走向工业化，需要科学供给必需的知识，解决重要的问题。而科学工作者由于为人民服务的观念的建立，懂得了理论联系实际的重要，已在农业、工业及医学方面，有很大的成就，此后定能发挥更大的作用，增进人民的幸福。
    尤其重要的是：中国科学工作者，已经深切地了解吸取苏联先进经验和结合劳动人民的重要。苏联的工业化，依靠劳动人民的增产节约，我们正有同样的情形。吸取苏联的先进经验，可以加速我们工业化的进展。三年以来，水利工程和不少工业上的成就，都是有力的例证。由于科学家与劳动人民相结合，劳动人民能把实际的经验告诉科学家，科学家运用理论来作进一步的研究，以提高生产技术，发展生产。新中国不少矿苗的发现和生产的改进，都是科学工作者与劳动人民这样合作的结果。只有在这样的合作基础上，科学家与劳动人民才能发挥最大的作用，也只有在工人阶级的领导下，才有这样合作的可能。
    因为政治条件的优越和思想水平的提高，新中国的科学工作者也已逐渐建立起正确的人生观。在过去，中国科学工作者所注意的现象，只局限于物质及生物，而忽略历史、社会发展的规律。这大半由于反动统治的压迫，使科学家不敢正视现实。在那时，一个科学家要不为统治阶级所利用，就只能做点学院式的研究。因此见地狭小，不能有正确的人生观。但在新中国，科学工作者不必逃避现实，可以通过实践而认识真理，进而改造客观的世界。
    三年以来，新中国的人民，正在共产党和毛主席领导之下，显出伟大的力量，创造光辉的奇迹，共同建设着美满的新中国，成为保卫远东和世界和平的重要力量。
