    Our Motherland is Truly Great and Lovable

    Comrade Editor: This spring, I was wounded on the Korean front and sent back to the motherland for treatment. At that time, my injuries were very serious. The doctors and nurses in the hospital demonstrated a high degree of class love, doing their best to provide me with medical care and constantly encouraging and comforting me in spirit, which reduced my pain and worries, and gradually restored my health. I deeply felt that only in the people's own country can there be such truly "healing the wounded and rescuing the dying" medical staff.

    During my recuperation, every ten days or so, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves would come to visit us. They said cheerfully and sincerely, "Volunteer Army Uncle, we wish you a speedy recovery and return to the front, and capture more American devils!" The children's demands represent the expectations of the people of the whole country for us, and are also our own wishes and determination.

    My home is along the Chengyu Railway. Because Chairman Mao led the people to build the railway that the reactionary rule had failed to build for more than forty years, fulfilling the long-cherished desire of the people along the line, my mother specially sent me a letter a few days ago to tell me about the joyful mood of the local people. At the beginning of this letter, she first said, "This letter is written by me personally." I was so happy that I jumped up when I saw these words. My mother is already fifty years old. She was an illiterate blind person for fifty years, but under the leadership of Chairman Mao, she learned the quick literacy method in three months and can now write letters herself.

    The new motherland, under the glorious illumination of Chairman Mao, is truly great and lovable. The people of the motherland have not only politically turned over and improved their lives, but also the high tide of cultural liberation is coming soon. For the sake of our great and lovable motherland, for the sake of my mother and children, I am determined to recuperate with peace of mind, strive to return to the front as soon as possible, and fight for the complete victory of the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

    我们的祖国实在伟大可爱
    编辑同志：今年春天我在朝鲜前线负了伤，被送回祖国治疗。当时我伤势很严重。医院里的大夫、护士们，发挥了高度的阶级友爱，尽心竭力地为我医疗护理，不断地在精神上鼓励我、安慰我，使我减少痛苦和顾虑，逐渐恢复了健康。我深深感觉到：只有在人民自己的国家里，才会有这样真正“救死扶伤”的医务工作人员。
    在休养时，每隔十天、八天，就有围着红领巾的少年儿童队员来慰问我们。他们愉快而真诚地说：“志愿军叔叔，祝你早日恢复健康，重返前线，多抓几个美国鬼子！”孩子们的要求代表了全国人民对我们的期望，也是我们自己的意愿和决心。
    我的家在成渝铁路的沿线。由于毛主席领导人民群众修通了反动统治四十多年来没有修通的铁路，满足了沿线人民群众多年的渴望，我母亲前些日子特地给我来了一封信，告诉我当地人民群众喜悦的心情。在这封信的开头，她首先说：“这封信是我亲自写的。”我看了这几个字喜得跳起来了。我母亲已经五十岁了。她当了五十年不识字的瞎子，在毛主席领导下，学了三个月的速成识字法，已经可以自己写信了。
    新生的祖国，在毛主席的光辉照耀下，实在伟大可爱。祖国人民不仅在政治上翻了身，改善了生活，文化翻身的高潮也快来到了。为了伟大可爱的祖国，为了母亲和孩子，我坚决安心休养，争取早日重返前线，为争取抗美援朝斗争的彻底胜利而奋斗。
