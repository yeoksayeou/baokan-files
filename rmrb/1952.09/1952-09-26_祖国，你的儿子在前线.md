On the front lines of the Han River, the autumn wind whips through the gunpowder smoke of artillery fire. Our soldiers are welcoming yet another autumn in Korea with new victories.

　　In a clump of bushes that has been broken and shattered by artillery fire, a figure can be vaguely seen, it is the young soldier Li Chunsheng. He is watching the enemy like he is watching a pack of wolves; his eyes are fixed on the front, unwilling to spare any energy to think about other things.

　　However, there are two things he can't put down in his heart, flashing in his mind from time to time. An hour later, after he finished explaining everything to the comrade who relieved him, he ran through the jungle as if flying, and sat down in the communication trench. It turned out that the first thing he couldn't put down was a letter in his pocket. When the messenger handed him the letter, it was just when he was about to go on sentry duty, and he went on sentry duty without even looking at it.

　　The letter came from the motherland. The moment Li Chunsheng received the letter, he thought: it must be from home, maybe from Chen Xin… But the address on the envelope was so blurred that nothing could be seen, and the signature only read:

　　"Sent from the Motherland." Attached to the back of the letter was a small note:

　　"Because the postal vehicle was damaged by enemy aircraft, this letter was rescued from water and fire. The address is no longer visible. Please ask the departments to find this person."

　　He opened the letter and first saw Chen Xin's name. In excitement, he said to himself: "How great it would have been if this letter had come yesterday!"

　　At this moment, he thought of the scene at yesterday's celebration meeting. At the meeting, he reported that during the blocking battle last autumn, only he and Chen Xin were left on their squad's position, but Chen Xin's leg was broken, and his own eyes were so irritated by gunpowder and gas that he couldn't see even ten meters away. So, the two of them worked together to operate a machine gun, and persisted for three days and three nights, repelling more than forty enemy assaults.

　　When he talked about this, his eyes were a little sore. Since that battle, he had been most afraid of mentioning the name of this little friend. When the division commander announced that he and Chen Xin had both received first-class merit awards and personally pinned the "Military Merit Medal" on his chest, although joy appeared on his face, he felt heavy in his heart. He was thinking of Chen Xin, he thought that their honor was inseparable, and he would always cherish this close comrade-in-arms. Although their homes were one in Hunan and one in the Northeast, when they first came to the squad, their speech was a little incomprehensible; but both of them were nineteen-year-old young men, and both were members of the Communist Youth League, and they were especially close when they gathered together. Especially in last year's battle, Chen Xin was seriously injured, and he personally carried Chen Xin down. At that time, the first-aid kit had been used up, so he used his hand to pinch the blood vessels in Chen Xin's leg to prevent it from bleeding. He thought that if he could reduce one drop of blood loss at this moment, it would be good for his future health. He also thought that when he sent Chen Xin back to the motherland for recuperation, he had instructed Chen Xin: "If you go to the Northeast, you can go to my house to have a look!" …Li Chunsheng had never worried in front of the enemy, but because he missed his comrade-in-arms, he had lost his appetite for several days.

　　Before receiving this letter, Li Chunsheng thought too much. He thought: it's autumn again, why hasn't Chen Xin come back yet? Even if he doesn't come back, he should send a letter, right? Could it be that he is disabled? Could it be… He was unwilling to think of his little friend's misfortune, but he was often worried about the closest people. He didn't sleep well last night.

　　Today, he read the letter in the communication trench in one breath, but he was not very happy. He repeatedly looked at these two sentences in the letter:

　　"Today is the fifth operation, and the doctor said: if it suppurates again, he will be disabled!" Li Chunsheng walked along the communication trench towards the cave they lived in, thinking: that is the hospital of the motherland, and Chen Xin must not be allowed to be disabled. But then he thought: this letter has been traveling in Korea for more than three months, who knows how Chen Xin's injury has fared after these three months!

　　At least Chen Xin has some news! This made Li Chunsheng feel more than half relieved. But there was still the second thing he couldn't put down, that is, the unit's combat readiness work was on its last day today. The troops will depart at dusk. They requested to take on the task of the assault team, and the superiors approved it. He thought the time had come to make great contributions to the motherland. His determination and that of all the comrades in the group were as fierce as if they were on fire. He still clearly remembered that the first time he participated in a battle last year, he felt the same feverish. But today, in addition to being happy, he was also considering how to lead a group to complete the assault mission. Last year, he was a new soldier, but now he is a combat squad leader. The age of eighteen to nineteen only increased by one year, but in this year he grew up in the army and fought on the Korean battlefield. Whether in thought or experience, he was like a mature adult.

　　As he walked, he thought about the terrain he had surveyed three times, the route of movement, and how to eliminate the enemy's pillbox. When he walked into the cave, everyone was discussing around a sand table. Some said: "Our howitzers and field guns can take down this pillbox!" Some said: "It has more than two meters of accumulated soil on top, and it is underground, so it is not easy to hit with artillery!" Some said: "Use explosive packs!" Some said: "Use grenades!" After listening to everyone's discussion, Li Chunsheng said: "Let's prepare several sets of plans, if this one doesn't work, there's another one!" This solved the problem.

　　Everyone knew that someone had sent a letter from the motherland to Li Chunsheng, and some people who knew Chen Xin also thought that it might be from him. When Li Chunsheng took out the letter for everyone to see, people excitedly gathered around to look. A soldier was reading aloud: "Dear comrade-in-arms…", who would have thought that before he finished reading the first sentence, the company commander shouted from outside: "Li Chunsheng, look who's here?" Everyone hurriedly ran out to see, and Li Chunsheng jumped over and hugged the newcomer, shouting: "Chen Xin!"

　　Chen Xin put down his luggage, and didn't know which sentence to say first. Someone asked: "Where did you recuperate in the motherland?" Someone asked: "Are the hospitals well-built?" He said: "The motherland, is there anything that isn't good!" Others asked: "Did you go home?" He said: "Arriving in the motherland is arriving home!" Then he talked about the female nurse who took care of him in the hospital, named Xiaolian, who was only fifteen years old. When he first arrived at the hospital, because his wound hurt, he couldn't eat, which made the little girl anxious and say: "If you don't eat, I won't eat either!" Later, the little girl also brought her mother, and the old lady watched over him every day. Chen Xin said: "Just like my mother, when I was discharged from the hospital, I learned that she had a son in Korea too!"

　　Li Chunsheng looked at Chen Xin's leg and asked him: "Is it completely healed?" Chen Xin stood up and straightened his leg for Li Chunsheng to see and said: "If it weren't in the motherland, with such a serious injury, don't even think about not being disabled. How many doctors treated me! They didn't know how many discussion meetings they held for my leg, they tried all the methods they could think of, and used all the good medicine, and finally no disability was left. I was discharged from the hospital more than a month ago and went to the health company. Just when we were about to cross the river, a call came from above saying: 'The motherland has sent a delegation to comfort our volunteer wounded and sick!' We waited for the delegation while we also turned around on the border."

　　The soldiers asked in unison: "How is the motherland being built?"

　　"How is it? The word 'good' can't describe it all. In many places, old houses have become new houses, small paths have become highways, small chimneys have become big chimneys! Li Chunsheng, don't think you are from the Northeast, when you go home in the future, you won't even recognize your village!"

　　Everyone asked: "How is Chairman Mao?"

　　Chen Xin said very happily: "I knew that once you got to the front, you would ask about the motherland and Chairman Mao. Let me tell you, the comrades in the delegation said: Chairman Mao is very healthy!" The cave was filled with joy, and everyone was happy for Chairman Mao's health.

　　Chen Xin had a lot to say to Li Chunsheng, and Li Chunsheng also wanted to ask about his family's situation, but everyone saw the company commander looking at his watch, and the time for the troops to depart had arrived. The company commander said: "Comrade Chen Xin, you stay behind to rest first, we are going to carry out a mission."

　　Chen Xin said: "I didn't come to the front to rest!"

　　The company commander said: "Your body is just recovered, you can't participate in the battle right away."

　　Chen Xin said: "My body has long been well, I'm not a new soldier, I came back to fight."

　　The company commander asked him to be in the second echelon, and he didn't quite agree. In the end, he was allowed to be in the second assault team.

　　After the battle started, Chen Xin was no more than a hundred meters away from Li Chunsheng. It was night, and under the illumination of the enemy's flares, Chen Xin clearly saw that Li Chunsheng was crawling on the hillside in front of him. Last year they fought together, and he was still a soldier, but now he was a small commander. Chen Xin heard Li Chunsheng giving the order to the soldiers in his group: "Advance!"

　　Our artillery fire leveled the enemy's barbed wire, minefields, and deer traps, but the pillbox was still spewing out several tongues of fire, blocking our path forward. Two comrades in the assault team were shot down when they went to blow it up. At this time, Li Chunsheng reported to the rear: "I am going to blow it up, please provide fire support from the rear!" In the hazy night, the comrades saw him crawling forward with several grenades.

　　Our machine guns were roaring like a whirlwind, hitting the stones on the pillbox and sending sparks flying. It looked like in another minute or two Li Chunsheng would crawl to the front of the pillbox, but who would have thought that just at this critical moment, our machine gunner was wounded, and when the enemy heard our machine gun go silent, they fired at Li Chunsheng like madmen.

　　Chen Xin's heart jumped up all of a sudden. In a flash, he thought: Was Li Chunsheng hit? He dragged the machine gun over and fired, and after three bursts of fire, "Bang! Bang! Bang!" a burst of fire went into a firing port of the enemy pillbox.

　　The enemy's machine gun immediately stopped firing, and Chen Xin looked forward and saw a figure crawling forward. Li Chunsheng was not hit by the enemy. When he heard his own machine gun stop, he immediately concealed himself. He thought to himself: As long as the enemy can't hit me, I can climb up once my machine gun fires.

　　At this time, Chen Xin suddenly discovered that another enemy machine gun was firing outwards from a place in the pillbox. So, before the enemy's burst of bullets was finished, he aimed the machine gun at the source of the fire and shot all the bullets into the hole; immediately afterwards, a burst of smoke and fire rose in the pillbox, and Li Chunsheng's grenade exploded inside.

　　The troops began to charge, the soldiers were cheering, and the company commander was also asking: "Who fired the machine gun?"

　　There was no reply for a long time. Chen Xin himself was very reluctant to speak. A new soldier standing next to him wanted to tell the company commander, but couldn't call out Chen Xin's name. When the company commander walked to Chen Xin and saw him using the machine gun to cover the troops as they advanced into the enemy's depths, he realized that the shooter was Chen Xin. The company commander said to him: "You shot really well!" Chen Xin said: "Have you forgotten? During the blocking battle last year, Li Chunsheng and I were on the same position, and we fired more than 20,000 bullets in three days and three nights. This skill was all practiced on the heads of the American devils."

　　In an instant, the company commander thought that when Chen Xin had just joined the Volunteer Army last year, he couldn't even carry a machine gun, and Li Chunsheng and he took turns carrying a small box of bullets.

　　Chen Xin picked up the machine gun and advanced forward with the troops. They climbed over pieces of enemy corpses, and developed into the enemy's depths along with their own artillery fire. By the time it was almost dawn, the sound of guns and artillery gradually thinned out, and our troops had occupied the predetermined position. Chen Xin and Li Chunsheng crawled on a small hilltop. Li Chunsheng then remembered to ask Chen Xin: "Have you been to my house?"

　　Chen Xin said: "I went, your mother also asked me to bring you something, I said there is nothing lacking here, but she still sent something."

　　"What did you bring?" Li Chunsheng asked eagerly.

　　Chen Xin fumbled in his pocket for a long time, took out a small cloth bag, wrapped three layers inside and out, and finally took out a golden Chairman Mao commemorative badge. Chen Xin said: "Your mother is a model worker, and this was awarded to her by the province. Your mother said: 'I am so old, let my son wear it!'"

　　Li Chunsheng took the commemorative badge and was moved to tears.

　　The sky was already bright, and the sun rose from the east coast. On the hilltop, the gunpowder smoke of artillery fire had not completely dissipated. Two red flags appeared from the verdant pine forest, they were reporting to the command post: we have completely occupied the enemy's position!

　　The red light of the morning sun bathed the victorious hilltop. Li Chunsheng and Chen Xin stood on the hilltop, their bodies were covered with mud, and their young faces were blackened by the smoke, but their spirits were not tired at all. They looked towards the distant northwest with the joy of victory - there was the beloved motherland, there was the beloved mother…

　　As they walked down from the position, they compared their height and said: "We have both grown taller!"

    祖国，你的儿子在前线
    张志民
    汉江前线的阵地上，秋风吹卷着炮火的硝烟。我们的战士，正在以新的胜利迎接着朝鲜的又一个秋天。
    在一个被炮火削得残断的灌木丛中，隐约地显出一个人影，那是年轻的战士李春生。他正在像监视狼群一样地监视着敌人；两眼直盯着前方，不愿意分散一点精力去想别的事。
    可是，他心里却有两件放不下的事，不时地在他的脑子里闪动。等到一个钟头以后，他向换班的同志作完了交代，就飞也似地通过丛林，跑进交通壕里坐了下来。原来第一件使他放不下的事，就是口袋里装的一封信。当通讯员交给他这封信的时候，正是他要上哨的时候，他没顾上看就上哨去了。
    信是打祖国来的。李春生接到信的一刹间就想到了：是家中来的，也许是陈新来的……但是信皮上的投处已经模糊得什么都看不出了，下款只是写着
    “寄自祖国”。在信的背面附着这样的一个小条：
    “因邮车被敌机打坏，此信由水火中抢出，投处已看不清，望各部转查此人。”
    他把信打开，首先就看到了陈新的名字，他在兴奋中自言自语地说：“这封信要是昨天来该多好啊！”
    这时，他想到了昨天庆功会上的情形。他在会上报告了在去年秋天阻击战的时候，在他们一个班的阵地上，打到只剩下他和陈新两个人了，可是陈新的腿被打坏了，他自己的眼睛也被火药和瓦斯薰得连十公尺也看不出去，于是，他们两个人就共同来操纵一挺机关枪，一直坚持了三天三夜，打退了敌人四十多次的冲锋。
    当他讲到这里的时候，他的眼睛有些发酸了。从那次战斗下来，他最怕提到这个小伙伴的名字。在师长宣布他和陈新都是一等功，并且亲自给他胸前戴上“军功章”的时候，他脸上虽然呈现出喜悦，可是心里却感到沉重。他是在想陈新，他想到他们的荣誉是分不开的，他永远怀念着这个亲密的战友。他两个人的家虽说是一个在湖南，一个在东北，刚到一个班的时候，说话还有点不大懂；可是两个人都是十九岁的小伙子，而且都是青年团员，聚在一起就特别亲近。特别是在去年的战斗中，陈新受了重伤，他亲自把陈新背下来，当时急救包已用光了，他就用手捏着陈新腿上的血管，不让它出血，他想这会儿少流一滴血，对他将来的健康就会有好处的。他又想到送陈新回祖国休养的时候，他曾嘱咐陈新：“你要是到了东北，可到我家里去瞧瞧啊！”……李春生在敌人面前从来没有发过愁，可是因为想念自己的战友，曾经几天吃不下饭去。
    在没接到这封信以前，李春生想的太多了。他想：又是一个秋天啦，陈新怎么还不回来呢？人不回来也该来个信呀？莫非他残废啦？莫非……他不愿意想到他的这个小伙伴的不幸，可是对于最亲近的人往往又是多虑的。昨天晚上他一直没有睡好。
    今天，他在交通沟里一气读完了这封信，但是他并不十分喜悦，他再三地看着信上的这两句话：
    “今天是第五次开刀了，医生说：要再化脓就得残废！”李春生顺着交通沟向他们住的洞子走着，心里想：那是祖国的医院，决不能让陈新残废了。可是他又想：这封信已在朝鲜游历了三个多月了，谁知道经过这三个多月，陈新的伤是好啦还是怎么样啦！
    陈新总算是有消息啦！这使李春生的心里就踏实了一多半。可是还有第二件他放不下的事，就是部队的战斗准备工作今天是最后的一天啦。黄昏的时候部队就要出发。他们请求担任突击组的任务，上级也批下来啦。他想为祖国立大功的时候到啦。他和全组同志的决心，都是像火烧着了那么炽烈。他还清楚地记得去年自己头一次参加战斗，心里也是这么发烧。可是今天他除去高兴之外，还在考虑着如何带一个组去完成突击的任务。去年他是个新战士，这会儿他是战斗小组长了。十八岁到十九岁只增加了一岁，可是这一年他生长在部队里，战斗在朝鲜战场上，不论在思想上和经验上，他都像个已经成熟的大人了。
    他一边走一边想着自己已经摸过了三次的地形，想着运动的道路，想着如何消灭敌人的那一个暗堡。当他走进洞子的时候，大家正围着一个沙盘在议论哩。有的说：“这个暗堡咱们的榴弹炮和野炮就把它搞掉啦！”有的说：“它上边有两公尺多厚的积土，又是在地下边，炮可不容易打！”有的说：“用炸药包！”有的说：“用手雷！”李春生听完大家的议论后说：“咱们准备好几套办法，这套不行还有那套！”这才把问题解决了。
    大家都知道有人打祖国给李春生来信了，有认识陈新的人也想到或许是他来的。当李春生掏出信来给大家看的时候，人们都兴奋地围上来瞧了。有一个战士给大家念着：“亲爱的战友……”，谁想到还没念完第一句，连长就在外边喊着：“李春生，你看谁来啦？”人们都急忙地跑出去看，李春生一下子跳过来，抱住这个刚来的人叫着：“陈新！”
    陈新放下行李，一肚子话真不知先说那一句。有人问：“你回祖国在哪儿休养的？”有人问：“医院里建设得好吗？”他说：“祖国嘛，还有不好的地方呀！”还有人问：“你回家了没有？”他说：“到了祖国就是到了家啦！”接着他就讲起，在医院里看护他的那个女护士叫小莲，才十五岁，他刚到医院的时候，因为伤口疼，吃不下饭去，把那小姑娘急得说：“你不吃饭，我也不吃啦！”以后，小姑娘把她娘也找来啦，那老太太天天看着他，陈新说：“真跟我母亲一样，我出院的时候，才知道她有个儿子也在朝鲜哩！”
    李春生望着陈新的腿问他：“是不是好利索啦？”陈新站起来，把腿伸直让李春生看着说：“要不是在祖国，那么重的伤，就别想不残废。多少医生给治呀！为我这一条腿，他们不知开了多少讨论会，能想到的办法都想尽了，好药都使到啦，总算一点残废也没留下。一个多月以前我就出院到了健康连啦，正说是过江哩，上边来电话说：‘祖国派的慰问团来慰问咱们志愿军的伤病员啦！’我们一边等着慰问团，一边到国境线上还转了转。”
    战士们异口同声地问：“祖国建设得怎么样啦？”
    “怎么样？光用个‘好’字是说不完的呀。好些地方旧房都变成新房啦，小道儿变成公路啦，小烟囱变成大烟囱啦！李春生，别看你是东北人，以后你回家，连你们的村子都不认识啦！”
    大家问：“毛主席怎么样呀？”
    陈新非常高兴地说：“我知道一到了前方，你们就得问祖国，问毛主席，告诉你们吧，慰问团的同志们说：毛主席很健康！”洞子里一片欢欣，大家都为毛主席的健康而高兴。
    陈新要和李春生说的话可长着啦，李春生也想打听自己家中的情形，可是大家都瞧见连长在看表，部队出发的时间已经到啦，连长说：“陈新同志，你先留在后边休息，我们要去执行任务。”
    陈新说：“我到前方不是来休息的呀！”
    连长说：“你的身体刚好，不能马上参加战斗。”
    陈新说：“我身体早好了，又不是新战士，我回来就是打仗的。”
    连长让他在第二梯队，他还不大同意，最后还是允许他在第二突击组。
    战斗打响以后，陈新离李春生也不过一百公尺。这是夜间，在敌人打起的几颗照明弹下边，陈新清清楚楚地看到他前边山坡上爬着的就是李春生。去年他们在一块打仗，他还是个战士，这会儿，他已经是个小指挥员了。陈新听到李春生对他组的战士发出的口令：“前进！”
    我们的炮火把敌人的铁丝网、雷区、鹿砦都打平了，只是那个暗堡里还向外喷着几条火舌，挡着我们前进的道路。突击组里两个同志去爆破都被打倒了。这时李春生向后边报告：“我要去爆炸它，请后边的火力支援我！”在朦胧的夜色里，同志们看到他提着几颗手雷就向前爬去了。
    我们的机枪就像刮风似的叫着，打得那暗堡上的石块火花飞迸。眼看再有一两分钟李春生就要爬到暗堡跟前了，谁想就偏偏在这个结骨眼上，我们的机枪射手负伤了，敌人一听我们的机枪哑了，就像疯了似的向李春生那里射击。
    陈新的心一下子吊上来了，他在一闪间想到：李春生是不是被打着了？他一把拖过机枪来就打，只听“叭！叭叭！”三发点射以后，“哗——”的一梭子，就打进了敌人暗堡的一个射口。
    敌人的这挺机枪立时就不叫唤了，陈新向前边看了看，有一个人影正向前爬哩。李春生并没被敌人打中，他听到自己的机枪一停，马上就隐蔽起来了，他心里想：只要敌人打不着我，等自己的机枪一响，我就能爬上去了。
    这时，陈新忽然发现敌人的另一挺机枪又从暗堡中的一个地方向外发射，于是，没等敌人那梭子子弹打完，他就把机枪顺着那道火光瞄准了，把一梭子子弹都射进了那个窟窿；紧接着暗堡里就冒起一阵烟火，李春生的手雷在里边爆炸了。
    部队开始了冲锋，战士们在喝彩，连长也在问：“机关枪是谁打的？”
    半天也没有回答的声音，陈新自己很不愿意讲，站在他旁边的一位新战士想告诉连长，可又叫不出陈新的名字。当连长走到陈新跟前，看到他又在用机枪掩护部队向敌人的纵深射击的时候，才知道这个射手就是陈新。连长对他说：“你打得真漂亮啊！”陈新说：“你忘啦，去年阻击战的时候，我跟李春生在一个阵地上，三天三夜打了两万多发子弹，这一手儿全是拿美国鬼子的脑袋练出来的。”
    一刹间，连长想到了陈新去年刚参加志愿军的时候，连机关枪还扛不动，李春生他两个还是替换着背一小箱子弹哩。
    陈新提起机枪，随着部队向前挺进。他们爬过一片片的敌人的尸体，随着自己的炮火，向敌人的纵深发展着。到天快亮的时候，枪炮声渐渐地稀疏了，我们的部队已经占领了预定的位置。陈新和李春生爬在一个小山顶上，李春生这才又想起来问陈新：“你到我家去过没有？”
    陈新说：“去啦，你娘还让我给你捎东西哩，我说这儿什么也不缺，结果还是捎来点东西。”
    “捎来什么啦？”李春生急着问。
    陈新在口袋里摸了半天，摸出个小小的布包，里里外外裹了三层，最后取出来一颗金色的毛主席纪念章。陈新说：“你娘是劳动模范，这是省里奖给她的，你娘说：‘我这么大年纪啦，还是给我儿子戴吧！’”
    李春生接过了这颗纪念章，感动得流下了热泪。
    天色已经大亮，太阳从东海岸上升起。山顶上，炮火的硝烟还没完全消散。从青翠的松林中显出了两面红旗，它们正在向指挥所报告：我们全部占领了敌人的阵地！
    朝阳的红光沐浴着胜利的山顶。李春生和陈新站立在山顶上，他们身上都沾满了泥土，他们那年轻的脸已被硝烟薰得黧黑，但是他们的精神一点也不显得疲倦。他们带着胜利的喜悦，向着遥远的西北方望去——那里是亲爱的祖国，那里有亲爱的母亲……
    两个人一边从阵地上往下走，一边在比着个儿说：“咱们两个都长高啦！”
