Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 4th: Angla Tribe Chieftain Xiang Qian of Jianzha District, Qinghai Province, was incited by counter-revolutionary spies and bandits for a long time to resist the People's Government. After repeated efforts to win him over, he finally returned to the People's Government on July 11th this year. The successful resolution of this event completely shattered the vicious conspiracy of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary remnants to instigate counter-revolutionary rebellion among the minority nationalities in Jianzha District. It has won the enthusiastic support of people from all ethnic groups and the broad masses, and has profoundly educated the vast number of cadres working in minority areas. This is an example of implementing the correct policy of the CPC Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau to resolutely strive to unite minority nationalities.

The Angla Tribe in Jianzha District, Qinghai Province, is located 300 li southeast of Xining City, a settlement of more than 8,000 Tibetan people in the high mountains and forests on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Yellow River. After the liberation of Qinghai, many remnants of the Kuomintang Ma Bufang bandits fled to Jianzha District and incited Angla Chieftain Xiang Qian to resist the People's Government. As a result, for more than two years, Xiang Qian has refused the leadership of the People's Government, blocked traffic in the surrounding areas, and even repeatedly armed intrusions into the border areas of Guide, Hualong, Xunhua, Tongren and other counties, attacking the People's Liberation Army several times.

In order to peacefully resolve the Angla Tribe issue, as early as October 1950, the Qinghai Provincial People's Government hired Xiang Qian as a member of the Qinghai Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee. From September 1951 to April this year, the Provincial People's Government successively sent special personnel 17 times to persuade Xiang Qian. Xi Raojia Cuo, Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, Zha Xi, Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee, Gu Jia Sai, Deputy Secretary-General, Yue Sai Duojie, Member of the Committee and Living Buddha of Ta'er Monastery Xia Rong Ga Bu, Huan Jue Cai Lang, Member of the Financial and Economic Committee, Sang Re Jia Cuo, Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education, Geng Deng, Deputy County Head of Guide County, Que Ji, Deputy County Head of Hualong County, Tong Qu Hu, County Head of Haiyan County, and Cai Gai, Deputy Manager of the Provincial Trading Company, and other well-known Tibetan figures, all personally went to sincerely persuade him. The Panchen Erdeni and Ta'er Monastery also specially sent representatives, including Ang Jia Ge Lai (Director of the Qinghai Office of the Panchen Lama in Tibet), with letters to negotiate in person. However, because Xiang Qian was surrounded by counter-revolutionary bandits, he was never aware of his errors, and repeated efforts failed to produce results. In February and March of this year, he openly instigated more than 1,000 people to intrude into the border areas of Guide and other counties three times, and attacked the local People's Liberation Army. At the same time, he also sent people to sneak into Tongde, Xinghai, Dulan and other counties to instigate and incite, attempting to expand the rebellion.

At the enlarged joint meeting of the Qinghai Provincial Consultative Committee and the Provincial People's Government Committee held on May 2nd this year, Tibetan representatives from the affected areas near Jianzha District denounced the crimes of the counter-revolutionary bandits and demanded that the People's Government immediately send troops to suppress them. Forty-five representatives including Living Buddhas, Xiang Zuo, Chieftains, Hundred Heads, Heads of Households and stewards also jointly wrote to the Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, exposing the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary bandits and demanding the suppression of the counter-revolutionary armed forces in Jianzha District. They pointed out that this kind of counter-revolutionary crime "completely violates our religion. They are 'robbers in the mountains during the day and thieves in the streets at night' (Tibetan proverb), making the area uneasy. They are simply 'without a past life and without a future life, like the embers in a haystack.' They are weeds in the fields and wolves in the flock. They are the public enemies of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai." After discussion, the meeting unanimously resolved that the People's Government had made "the utmost effort" in striving for Xiang Qian seventeen times. "In order to rescue the people of all ethnic groups who are being ravaged by bandits and accept the application of the people of all ethnic groups, send troops to suppress them." The Qinghai Provincial People's Government also proposed that Xiang Qian be given a chance to start anew. As long as he can rein in at the edge of the cliff and break away from the counter-revolutionary bandits, the People's Government can still not hold him accountable for the past and protect his life, property and position as chieftain.

In early May, the People's Liberation Army of the Qinghai Military Region, with the cooperation of the Tibetan and other ethnic groups, entered Jianzha District. Most of the local reactionary armed forces surrendered. Xiang Qian himself fled with a small number of men and hid in the deep mountains. The PLA suppression troops entered Jianzha District with strict discipline, committing no offenses, fully respecting the customs and habits of the local Tibetan people, strictly protecting the monasteries, and actively resettling the affected masses, resolutely implementing the policies stipulated in the "Letter to the People of All Ethnic Groups." Except for foreign counter-revolutionary ringleaders, all other Tibetan people captured on the battlefield, including leaders and officials, were released immediately upon capture. Among them, Qiu Ji and Ma Guanjia, the leaders who directly participated in organizing the rebellion, were also released. Xiang Qian's family was always protected by the People's Liberation Army. Xiang Qian's mother was bedridden, and the People's Government medical team carefully treated her, which made Xiang Qian's wife deeply feel that Xiang Qian had been deceived by the counter-revolutionary bandits and hoped that Xiang Qian would return. Soon, Xiang Qian's second younger brother E Tong, secretary Wan Ma Xing Ji and others came back and surrendered. The steward of Ji Dang Monastery, the steward of Bai Fo Monastery in Gu Lei Temple, and the person in charge of the Mani Pit of the "Red Sect" in Ru Qi Village summoned more than 100 people to surrender. The masses in the area also returned home to resume production. The Provincial People's Government allocated 200 million yuan in relief funds and 80,000 jin of relief grain for relief, and transferred a large number of medical, cultural, educational, trade, and ethnic cadres to organize work teams, carrying a large number of cloths, salt, tea, various precious medicines, films and Tibetan propaganda materials needed by the masses in the area to offer condolences. Zhou Renshan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Sang Re Jia Cuo, Deputy Director of the Department of Culture and Education of the Provincial People's Government, Yue Sai Duojie, Member of the Ethnic Affairs Commission, Gu Jia Sai, Deputy Secretary-General of the Provincial Consultative Committee, and Que Ji, Deputy County Head of Hualong County also went to offer condolences. Thanks to these measures, social order in Jianzha District quickly stabilized. The local people were helped by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government to live in peace and resume production, and the monasteries recited scriptures as usual. Trade, medical and relief work teams traveled throughout the eight villages of Angla and cured 2,155 patients. The People's Government and the People's Liberation Army continued to actively carry out political work to win over Xiang Qian during the suppression. Sai Chi Living Buddha of Angla Deqian Monastery, Chen Lei Living Buddha of Gulang Monastery, and Wan De Tai, an old man from Jianzha, were willing to win Xiang Qian back after witnessing the great policy spirit of the People's Government.

At this point, the living facts completely exposed the rumors and deceptions of the counter-revolutionary bandits. Under the influence of the correct ethnic policy of the People's Government, Xiang Qian finally returned to Jianzha District on the afternoon of July 11th and returned to the people, and arrived in Xining City on July 31st. Zhao Shoushan, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, and Zhang Zhongliang, Vice Chairman, met with him. On August 5th, the Ethnic Affairs Committee of the Provincial People's Government convened a symposium of representatives from all ethnic groups to discuss the future work in Jianzha District. Xiang Qian expressed his feelings after returning to the people at the meeting. He said: "I am now completely relieved and have no worries!" Xiang Qian also wrote an article published in the Qinghai Daily. He wrote: "In the past, the People's Government tried to win me over as many as seventeen times, but I did not turn back. Why can I come back now? First of all, after the People's Government arrived in Angla, it resettled and relieved the people of Angla, protected the monasteries, released the captured personnel, allowing them to return home and live and produce in peace, and took care and protected my family and property. Even my old mother who was sick in bed was given treatment, and not a single thread or needle was lost in my home. Although I fled in fear of punishment during the battle, I was moved by the great policy of the Communist Party and the People's Government, so I realized the true face of the bandits and made up my mind to turn back and plead guilty, and no longer do things with the bandits that harm the people. In the future, I must take practical actions to make meritorious service and redeem my sins to repay the kindness of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and the People's Government." The Qinghai Provincial People's Government has appointed Xiang Qian to continue to serve as the Angla Chieftain.

In early August, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, Liu Geping, Deputy Director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, and Wang Feng, Director of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, arrived in Lanzhou on official business. Xiang Qian requested to see them. Zhang Zhongliang, Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, and Zhou Renshan, Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, accompanied Xiang Qian from Xining to Lanzhou on August 10th. When Xiang Qian met Xi Zhongxun, he expressed his repentance and expressed his deep gratitude for the long-term and multiple efforts of the People's Government to win him over with a generous spirit. He said: "In the past, I was deceived by counter-revolutionary bandits and did many bad things. In the future, I must do some good things for the people to make meritorious service and redeem my sins." Xi Zhongxun reiterated the spirit of equality and unity of the People's Government towards minority nationalities based on the Common Program and the ethnic policy, and encouraged him to do a good job in various construction projects in Jianzha District under the leadership of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government in the future. That evening, Xi Zhongxun hosted a banquet.

    人民政府执行争取团结少数民族的政策的一个范例
    青海省昂拉部落千户项谦归向人民政府
    【新华社西安四日电】青海省尖札区昂拉部落千户项谦，长期被反革命特务土匪煽惑，与人民政府对抗，先后经反复争取，终于在今年七月十一日归向人民政府。这一事件的圆满解决，彻底粉碎了帝国主义和国民党反动派残匪妄图在尖札区少数民族中策动反革命叛乱的恶毒阴谋；取得了各少数民族各方面人士和广大群众的热烈拥护；也深刻地教育了在少数民族地区工作的广大干部。这是执行中共中央和西北局坚决争取团结少数民族的正确方针的范例。
    青海省尖札地区昂拉部落，位于西宁市东南三百华里，是黄河上游西岸高山丛林中八千余藏族人民的聚居区。青海解放后，国民党马步芳残余匪徒，不少逃聚尖札地区，煽惑昂拉千户项谦，与人民政府对抗。因而两年多来，项谦一直拒绝人民政府领导，并阻塞周围地区交通，甚至向附近贵德、化隆、循化、同仁等县边界藏族和其他各族人民不断地武装进扰，几度袭击人民解放军。
    为使昂拉部落问题得以和平解决，早在一九五○年十月，青海省人民政府即曾聘请项谦为省各界人民代表会议协商委员会委员；自一九五一年九月起至今年四月，省人民政府又先后十七次派遣专人前往说服项谦，省人民政府副主席喜饶嘉措，协商委员会副主席札喜，副秘书长古嘉赛，委员、塔尔寺法台夏茸尕布，民族事务委员会委员岳赛多杰，财经委员会委员宦觉才郎，文教厅副厅长桑热嘉错，贵德县副县长更登，化隆县副县长却吉，海晏县县长同曲呼，省贸易公司副经理彩盖等藏族知名人士，均曾亲自前往诚恳规劝；班禅额尔德尼和塔尔寺亦曾特派代表昂嘉格赖（西藏班禅驻青海办事处处长）等持函亲往商谈。但因项谦受反革命匪徒包围，总不觉悟，屡次争取未有结果。今年二、三月间，复公然三次策动千余人之众进扰贵德等县边境地区，并袭击当地人民解放军。同时又派人潜至同德、兴海、都兰等县策动煽惑，妄图扩大叛乱。
    今年五月二日青海省协商委员会、省人民政府委员会举行的扩大联席会议上，尖札地区附近受害藏族代表，纷纷控诉反革命匪徒的罪行，要求人民政府立即进兵清剿；活佛、襄佐、千户、百户、头人、管家等代表四十五人也联名上书省人民政府主席，揭发反革命匪徒的万恶罪行，要求肃清尖札区反革命武装。并指出这种反革命罪行“完全违背了我们的宗教，他们‘白天在做山里的强盗，晚上在做街上的窃贼’（藏族谚语），把地方弄得不安，简直是‘无前世、无后世，好像草堆里的余烬一样’，他们是田地里的莠草，羊群中的恶狼，他们是青海各族人民的公敌”。会议经过讨论，并一致作出决议，认为人民政府十七次争取项谦，“实属仁至义尽”，“为解救被匪徒蹂躏的各族人民，接受各族人民的申请，派兵清剿”，青海省人民政府并提出对项谦千户，仍然给以自新之路，只要能悬崖勒马与反革命匪徒脱离关系，人民政府仍可不究既往，保护其生命财产及千户职位。
    青海军区人民解放军，五月初在藏族及各族人民协力配合下，进入尖札区，当地反动武装大部投降，项谦本人携少数人马逃跑，潜匿深山中。解放军进剿部队进入尖札区，纪律严明，秋毫无犯，十分尊重该地藏族人民风俗习惯，严格保护寺院，并积极安置被难群众，坚决执行“告各族人民书”中规定之政策。除外来的反革命匪首外，其他在战场上所俘的藏族的人，包括头目、官人等，一律随捉随放。其中如直接参加组织叛乱的头目秋吉、麻管家等也被释放，项谦家庭始终受到人民解放军的保护，项谦母亲卧病在床，人民政府医疗队曾细心给以治疗，使项谦之妻深感项谦受了反革命匪徒的欺骗，希望项谦归回。不久，项谦二弟俄同、秘书万马行吉等三人相率归来投诚。吉礑寺管家、古雷寺白佛管家，茹其村“红教”麻尼坑主事人等三人并召回一百余人归降，该地群众亦纷纷回家生产。省人民政府拨发了救济款两亿元、救济粮八万斤进行救济，并抽调大批医疗、文教、贸易、民族等干部组织工作队，带着该区群众急需的大量布匹、食盐、茶叶、各种贵重药品、电影及藏文宣传品等，前往抚慰。中共青海省委员会统一战线工作部部长周仁山、省人民政府文教厅副厅长桑热嘉错、民族事务委员会委员岳赛多杰、省协商委员会副秘书长古嘉赛、化隆县副县长却吉等亦前往慰问。由于这些措施，尖札区社会秩序很快安定。当地人民得到人民解放军和人民政府帮助安居生产，寺院里照常念经。贸易、医疗、救济工作队走遍了昂拉八庄，并治好了二千一百五十五个病人。人民政府和人民解放军在进剿中，对项谦仍继续积极进行政治争取工作。昂拉德欠寺赛池活佛、古浪寺陈雷活佛，和尖札老民完德泰等，目睹人民政府伟大的政策精神后，均愿争取项谦归来。
    至此，活生生的事实便完全揭穿了反革命匪徒的造谣欺骗，项谦在人民政府正确的民族政策感召下，终于在七月十一日下午重回尖札区归向人民，并于七月三十一日到西宁市。省人民政府主席赵寿山、副主席张仲良等即予接见。八月五日，省人民政府民族事务委员会召集各族各界代表开座谈会商讨今后尖札区工作，项谦在会上发表了归向人民后的感想，他说：“我现在已经完全宽心，毫无顾虑了！”项谦并撰文刊登青海日报，他写道：“过去人民政府对我争取了十七次之多，我没有回头，而现在为什么能回来呢？首先是人民政府到昂拉后，对昂拉百姓进行了安置和救济，保护了寺院；释放了被俘人员，使他们回家安心生产，对我的家眷、财产也予以照顾和保护；连病在床上的我的老母也给予治疗，家中一针一线都没有损失。我虽然在战斗中畏罪跑了出去，但在共产党和人民政府伟大政策感召下，我受到感动，从而认识了匪徒们的真正面貌，便下决心回头请罪，不再跟匪徒作危害人民的事情。今后我一定要以实际行动，立功赎罪，报答毛主席、共产党和人民政府的恩典。”青海省人民政府已委任项谦继任昂拉千户。
    八月上旬，西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋、中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员刘格平、西北军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员汪锋等因公抵达兰州时，项谦要求谒见。当由青海省人民政府副主席张仲良和中共青海省委员会统一战线工作部部长周仁山偕同项谦于八月十日由西宁赴兰州。项谦在进见习仲勋时表示忏悔，并对人民政府长期内多次争取的宽大精神深表感激。他说：“我过去受了反革命匪徒的欺骗，作了许多坏事，今后一定要为人民作些好事来立功赎罪。”习仲勋根据共同纲领民族政策，重申人民政府对待少数民族平等团结的精神，并勉励他今后在青海省人民政府领导下，好好作好建设尖札区各项建设工作。当晚，习仲勋并设宴款待。
