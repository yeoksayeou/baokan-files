    Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 23rd: In recent days, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces have annihilated over 1,300 American invading troops in the Chorwon and Yonchon areas on the east bank of the Imjin River on the Western Front.
    At dusk on the 18th, a unit of our army launched a counterattack against an enemy position on the east side of Sangpo-ri, between Chorwon and Yonchon, on the east bank of the Imjin River. This heroic counterattacking force, supported by powerful artillery fire and tanks, captured the hill in just twelve minutes of battle, annihilating all the enemy defenders. It then took advantage of the victory to attack another nearby high ground, and after half an hour of battle, also captured that enemy position. In the fighting on these two high grounds, our army annihilated an reinforced company of the US 2nd Division, totaling over 200 men. While the fighting on these two high grounds was underway, the enemy dispatched a battalion of infantry and four tanks to reinforce them, but they were met with a heavy blow from our ambushing troops, and the enemy's five counterattacks were all repulsed. Our army annihilated over 200 enemy troops and destroyed one enemy tank. At about 1:00 AM on the 19th, the enemy, in coordination with three tanks and aircraft artillery, frantically counterattacked the high ground east of Sangpo-ri, which had been captured by our army. The strength of the enemy increased from four platoons to a battalion, and they launched eleven consecutive assaults, all of which were heroically repulsed by our army. In the battle, our army launched four fierce counterattacks on the position with a small number of troops. After sixteen hours of fierce fighting, our army repelled the enemy, annihilating a total of over 560 enemy troops.
    On the 18th, another unit of our army also captured two high grounds in the southwest of Chorwon and the northwest of Yonchon, annihilating a part of the American troops.
    In the several days of fighting in the Chorwon and Yonchon areas, according to incomplete statistics, our army annihilated over 1,340 American troops, captured four 60mm mortars, two rocket launchers, eleven light and heavy machine guns, thirty-six carbines, thirty-nine automatic rifles, and five pistols.
    In these few days, our army's highly skilled anti-aircraft gunners also shot down four enemy planes and damaged six enemy planes in the battle area.
