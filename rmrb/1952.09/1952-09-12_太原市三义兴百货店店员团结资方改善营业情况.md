    Taiyuan City Sanyi Xing Department Store Employees Unite with Capitalists to Improve Business

    Editor: After the "Five-Anti" movement, the employees of Taiyuan City's Sanyi Xing Department Store proactively united with the capitalists to improve business, resulting in a rapid improvement in business conditions and a monthly increase in turnover.

    Yang Hufang, the manager of Sanyi Xing Department Store, lacked confidence in business operations after the "Five-Anti" movement. Du Zhenguo, the chairman of the store's trade union, discussed the matter with the employees and proactively proposed many rationalization suggestions to the capitalists. They also established a labor-capital business research meeting system, changing the old business policy. First, they researched and decided to fix the prices of goods and adopt a "small profits, quick turnover" approach. In the past, the store's business policy was "less turnover, more profit," hoping to reduce business tax, but in reality, it was "speculation and profiteering." Since the employees proposed "small profits, quick turnover" and rationally set prices, the number of customers gradually increased. Soon, they established commercial relations with large stores in more than a dozen counties in Shanxi Province, such as Yangquan and Lingshi, enabling rapid movement of goods. Second, selling goods for cash enables rapid capital turnover. In the past, in order to seek high profits, more than 80 percent of the goods wholesaled by the store were on credit, so often the goods were sold out, but there was no money to buy new goods. Now, with the implementation of low-interest cash payments, the monthly business turnover has increased. The average for April and May was 370 million yuan, and in July it increased to 515.8 million yuan, exceeding the income of any previous peak month. Now the store does not need to borrow from banks at all, and does not feel any difficulty in the turnover of working capital.

### 太原市三义兴百货店店员团结资方改善营业情况

    太原市三义兴百货店店员团结资方改善营业情况
    编辑同志：太原市三义兴百货店店员，在“五反”运动后主动团结资方搞好业务，使营业情况迅速好转，营业额逐月增加。
    三义兴百货店经理杨荟芳，“五反”后对经营业务信心不足。该店工会主席杜振国便和店员们商量，主动地向资方提出许多合理化建议，并建立了劳资双方业务研究会议制度，改变了旧的营业方针。首先他们研究出应固定货物价格，采取“薄利多销”的方针。过去这个店营业方针是“少做流水，多赚钱”，想借此少出营业税，实际上是要“投机倒把，贪得暴利”。自从店员们提出“薄利多销”，合理规定价格后，顾主逐渐增加，很快就与山西省阳泉、灵石等十几县的大商店建立了商业来往，使货物速进速出。其次，卖货收现款，使资金迅速周转。过去这个店为了谋得高利，批发出去的货物百分之八十以上是赊账，所以经常货物卖完了，就没钱买新货。现在规定了低利收现款，使营业流水额逐月增加，四、五两月份平均为三亿七千多万元，七月份提高到五亿一千五百八十多万元，超过以往任何旺月时期的收入。现在这个店完全不向银行贷款，也不感觉流动资金周转困难了。
