    A Model Sanitation Street in Jinzhou City
    Bì Lù

    In the mass patriotic sanitation movement, Jinzhou, like many other cities in our country, has also seen "miracles": mosquitoes, flies, and fleas have been greatly reduced compared to previous years, and have even disappeared in some places. The slogan "No rats in every home, no insects in every household" is being gradually realized.

    Before liberation, Jinzhou City was full of piles of garbage everywhere, both on the main streets and in the alleys, and even the manure yards were set up in the city. Especially in the densely populated First and Second Districts, those two stinky ditches alone were enough to threaten the health of a quarter of the city's population. Therefore, in the past, the people living along the ditches called these two ditches "Gates of Doom." Since liberation, especially since the launch of the patriotic sanitation movement, under the leadership of the People's Government and the joint efforts of the residents, the face of the city has completely changed. Garbage is now cleared daily, manure yards have been moved outside the city, and the stinky ditches have been filled in. According to the Jinzhou Municipal Public Health Authority, from January to July this year, the number of people suffering from infectious diseases in the city has decreased by more than four times compared to last year; the number of people suffering from dysentery has decreased by more than ten times compared to last year. The public health habits and moral outlook of the citizens have undergone tremendous changes.

    I am a person living in this city, and I have visited a street—Anfu Street in the Third District of Jinzhou City. From the changes in the sanitation situation on this street, we can see the great achievements of the patriotic sanitation movement in Jinzhou City.

    In the past, everyone called this street "Poor Man's Street" because most of the residents here were pedicab drivers, cart pullers, and laborers. On this bumpy street, there was horse manure and dog feces everywhere. When the wind blew, dust mixed with manure would blow onto the kangs, stoves, and pot lids of each household. After heavy rain, the street was full of black, muddy sludge. The furniture in every house was covered in dust and cobwebs, and even the air felt foul. But today, this street has been rated as one of the model sanitation streets in Jinzhou City. The entire street is swept clean, and the air in the houses is much fresher. Every household has not only cleaned their clothes, bedding, pots, bowls, ladles, basins, boxes, and cabinets, but even the "lintels" that have not been touched for decades have been wiped spotless. I asked Ding Tianhui, the street committee member of this street: "Can you always maintain such cleanliness? Do you often have inspections?" He replied with a smile: "Of course, it's like this every day. As for inspections, everyone is an inspector." He said that the residents here now have a considerable understanding of the significance of the patriotic sanitation movement. As long as there is a windy day, each household, regardless of adults or children, men or women, will invariably sprinkle water on the street to ensure that no dust is raised. Every morning, the residents of each household come out to sweep the street, and after sweeping the street, they sweep the yard, and finally wipe the doors and windows and wash the utensils. This has become a way of life. The actions of the residents here are very consistent, like an army fighting under an order, and all are conscious and voluntary.

    "In this movement, haven't you encountered any difficulties?" I then asked Ding Tianhui. He replied without hesitation: "Of course, there are difficulties. For example, in the beginning, some residents didn't pay much attention to this movement. Take Li Qinghe, a cart driver, for example. The glass on his windows had never been wiped since the day it was installed, and it was so dirty that it was opaque. Others advised him to wipe it clean, but he deliberately called it 'black glass.' There was no other way, so everyone helped him wipe it. This made him feel touched, and the next day, he wiped it sparkling clean and never said anything backward again. But there are not many people like this."

    According to Ding Tianhui, there are two people on this street who are worth mentioning: one is the old man, Ma Xiu, who is almost eighty years old, and the other is Li Jia's wife.

    Li Jia's wife is a housewife who used to be notoriously dirty. For example, she would always wash the pot and bowl only at dinner time after eating breakfast, and the dust on the stove was never cleaned all year round. But in this patriotic sanitation movement, she won an award. After receiving the award, she said very modestly: "I am still far behind others! I must do better in the future!" She shared a toilet with four or five neighbors, and she volunteered to clean it alone. Someone asked her why she was so diligent, she said: "Patriotic sanitation is everyone's business. I can't ruin everyone's business!"

    Old man Ma Xiu is almost eighty years old and is blind. He has a large family, and he no longer needs to work. But in this patriotic sanitation movement, he appeared as active as any young man. He spends all day wiping this and that with a rag, or helping people in the same courtyard squeeze water to wash things. If the street holds a meeting on patriotic sanitation, even if it is in the middle of the night, he must attend. His daughter-in-law often dissuades him, worrying that he will bump into things, but he says dissatisfiedly: "The patriotic sanitation movement is a good thing, strengthening the body and protecting the country. Can I not listen to the meeting!"

### 锦州市的一条卫生模范街

    锦州市的一条卫生模范街
    荜路
    在群众性爱国卫生运动中，锦州市和我国其它许多城市一样，也出现了“奇迹”：蚊子、苍蝇、跳蚤比往年大大减少了，在好些地方并已绝迹。“家家无鼠，户户无虫”的口号，正在逐步实现着。
    解放前的锦州市，不论大街小巷，到处都是一堆一片的垃圾，连粪场都设在城里。特别是人口稠密的第一、二区，仅那两条臭气冲天的水沟，就足以威胁全市四分之一的人口的健康。所以，过去沿沟居住的人们，都把这两条沟叫做“丧门沟”。解放以后，特别是从展开爱国卫生运动以来，在人民政府的领导和居民的共同努力之下，全市的面貌完全改变了。垃圾已做到了当日清除，粪场挪到城外去了，臭水沟也被填了起来。据锦州市公共卫生机关的了解，从今年一月到七月，全市患传染病的人，比去年少四倍多；害痢疾病的人，要比去年少十多倍。市民的公共卫生习惯和道德面貌都起了巨大变化。
    我是生活在这座城市里的人，我曾访问过一条街——锦州市三区的安福街。从这条街的卫生情况的改变，可以看出锦州全市爱国卫生运动的巨大成绩。
    过去，人人都把这条街叫做“穷棒子街”，因为这里的住户多半是踏三轮的、赶大车的、做小工的。在这条坑坑洼洼的街上，那儿都有马粪、狗屎，一刮起风来，夹杂着粪末的尘土，便会刮到各家的炕上、锅台上和锅盖上。下了大雨，满街是黑糊糊的臭泥浆。家家屋子里的家具都被罩在灰络尘网里，连空气也使人感到恶浊。可是今天，这条街已被评为锦州市的卫生模范街之一了。整条街都清扫得干干净净，屋里的空气也新鲜得多了。家家户户，不仅衣服、被褥、锅碗、瓢盆、箱子、柜子是弄得一干二净，就连那几十年来没有动过的“过梁”，也都擦得一尘不染。我问本街的街道委员丁天惠：“你们是不是经常都能保持这样清洁呢？你们常有人进行检查么？”他笑着回答我：“当然是天天这样。说到检查，谁都是检查员。”他说目下这里的居民，对爱国卫生运动的意义都有相当的认识了。只要遇到刮风天，各住户，不论大人小孩，男的女的，都不约而同地往街上泼水，准保扬不起尘土来。每天清早，各户居民都出来扫街，扫完街便扫院子，最后擦门窗，洗刷用具。这已经成为一种生活习惯了。这里的居民的行动很一致，好像军队在一个命令下作战一样，而且都是自觉自愿的。
    “你们在这个运动中间，难道就没有碰到一点困难么？”我接着又问丁天惠。他毫不迟疑地回答我：“当然，困难是有的。比如一开头，有个别居民不大理会这个运动。就拿赶车的李庆和来说吧，他家窗户上的玻璃从安上的一天起就没有擦过，脏得都不透明了，别人劝他擦洗一下，他故意说是‘乌玻璃’。没有办法，大伙便动手替他擦，这一下使他感动了，第二天，他把它擦得溜光闪亮，再也不说落后话了。不过像这样的人是并不多的。”
    据丁天惠说，在这条街上，还有两个人是值得提一提的：一个是将近八十岁的老大爷——马秀，另一个是李贾氏。
    李贾氏是个家庭妇女，过去是脏得出名的。例如她早晨吃了饭，总要到晚饭时才洗盆刷碗，锅台上的尘土终年不打扫。但在这次爱国卫生运动中，她得了奖。她在受奖以后很谦虚地说：“我比人差的还远哩！往后我一定要往好些搞！”她和四五户邻居合用一个厕所，她自愿独自打扫。有人问她为啥这样勤快，她说：“爱国卫生是大家的事。咱不能破坏大家的事！”
    马秀老大爷，是快到八十岁的人了，而且是个瞎子。他家人口很多，本来已经用不着他再劳动了。可是在这次爱国卫生运动中，他显得和一般年青小伙子同样积极。他整天拿抹布擦这擦那，或者帮同院里的人轧水刷洗东西。如果街道上召开有关爱国卫生的会，就是半夜深更，他也非去参加不可。他的儿媳经常劝阻他，耽心他磕着碰着，但他不满意地说：“爱国卫生运动是件好事，强身保国。我不听会那还行吗！”
