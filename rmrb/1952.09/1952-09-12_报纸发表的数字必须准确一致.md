    Published Figures in Newspapers Must Be Accurate and Consistent

    Comrade Editor: All kinds of figures published in newspapers must be accurate and consistent; otherwise, it will affect the authenticity of news reports. In some newspapers, there are often inconsistencies in figures published at different times, which is very inappropriate. For example, in the news "New-Style Farm Tools Steadily Promoted in Northwest China" published on the first page of the Xi'an Mass Daily on June 29, it said: "In the past two years... more than 40 kinds of demonstration new-style farm tools, more than 1,200 pieces, have been promoted. Nearly 100,000 pieces of various new-style farm tools have been promoted... This year, 63,000 pieces have been promoted, and it is expected that 140,000 pieces can be promoted..." However, in the article "Vigorously Replenishing Old-Style Farm Tools and Steadily Promoting New-Style Farm Tools" on the second page of the same newspaper on the same day, it said: "In the past two years... more than 40 kinds of farm tools have been demonstrated and promoted, with more than 1,600 pieces. More than 35,000 pieces of various farm tools, including various walking plows, cotton strip seeders, five-tooth small weeders, wheat harvesters, rice threshers, corn shellers, and grass shovels, have been promoted. It is expected that the number of promotions may reach more than 180,000 pieces by the end of this year..." Which of these figures is accurate and reliable? Furthermore, the original length of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was planned to be "530 kilometers." After the Sh板滩 line was changed, the entire line was shortened to "505 kilometers." However, in the news "Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Paved to Chengdu Station Yesterday" published on the first page of the Western Sichuan Daily on June 13, it was "530 kilometers." It is suggested that the editorial departments of newspapers in various regions strengthen the verification and research of various figures; strive for accuracy and consistency, so that the above-mentioned errors no longer appear in our newspapers.　Wang Lang

    报纸发表的数字必须准确一致
    编辑同志：报纸上发表的各种数字必须准确一致，否则就要影响新闻报道的真实性。在有些报纸上，常常出现先后不一致的数字，这是很不应该的。例如西安群众日报六月二十九日一版发表的“西北稳步推广新式农具”消息中说：“两年来……各种示范新式农具四十余种、一千二百余件，已推广各种新式农具近十万件，……今年已推广六万三千件，预计可以推广十四万件……。”但在该报同日二版“大力增补旧式农具，稳步推广新式农具”一文中，却说：“二年来……示范推广农具四十余种、一千六百余件，推广各种农具、各式步犁、棉花条播机、五齿小耘锄、割麦机、打稻机、玉米脱粒机、铲草机等三万五千余件，预计到今年年底推广数量可能达到十八万件以上……。”这些数字，究竟那个是准确可靠的呢？又如成渝铁路线原定“五百三十公里”长，经过石板滩改线后，已将全线缩短至“五百零五公里”；但川西日报在六月十三日一版刊登的“成渝铁路昨日铺轨至成都车站”的消息中，却为“五百三十公里”。建议各地报纸的编辑部，要加强对各种数字的核对和研究；力求准确一致，使我们的报纸不再出现上述错误。　王　朗
