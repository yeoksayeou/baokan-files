    Sichuan Province has a vast area and a large population, and its liberation came relatively late. In the past, in order to accelerate the implementation of the various policies of the People's Government, it was divided into four administrative regions. Now, after two years of work in the four administrative regions, a foundation has been laid for re-division into one province. Sichuan Province is a major province in China, with a total of seventeen special districts and one hundred and thirty-eight counties, as well as two municipalities directly under the province. The province covers an area of more than 300,000 square kilometers and has a population of more than 56 million. The province has a network of rivers and is rich in resources, earning it the title of "Land of Abundance."
