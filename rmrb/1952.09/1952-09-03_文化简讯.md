Cultural Briefs

Contents of "Wenyi Bao" No. 16 Introduced

Many excellent songs and dances from the literary and artistic competitions of the "August 1st" Army Day sports meet demonstrated the heroic spirit and revolutionary optimism of the soldiers, and showed the strong combat effectiveness and extensive mass character of the army's literary and artistic activities. The article "Combative and Mass-Oriented Excellent Works of the Armed Forces" (Reporter), published in "Wenyi Bao," provides a comprehensive review of these songs and dances. The creation of New Year pictures in the past two years has achieved significant results, but there are still some shortcomings that need to be overcome urgently. Wang Chaowen's article, "Creating Realistic Images," discusses the shaping problem of New Year picture art by criticizing the ugly and "generalized" phenomena in many specific New Year picture works. Mei Lanfang's article, "New Direction of Chinese Opera Art," makes specific comments on issues such as the review and revision of old scripts, the creation of new scripts, the ideological transformation of artists, the reform of the old unreasonable system of opera troupes, and the relationship between artists and the masses in the reform of opera. Regarding the improvement of popular literature and art works and the content of local literary and art publications, this issue of "Wenyi Bao" publishes three articles: "To Create a Large Number of Excellent Popular Literature and Art Works," "On the Language of Local Popular Literature and Art Publications," and "On the Guidance of Literary and Art Publications for Beginners." In this issue, "Wenyi Bao" published three letters from readers under the title "Hope to Launch Criticism of Conceptualization and Formalization Tendencies," criticizing the conceptualization and formalization tendencies in current literary and artistic creation and publicity activities. This issue also publishes a translated paper, "Gorky on Describing the Struggle Between the Old and the New."
