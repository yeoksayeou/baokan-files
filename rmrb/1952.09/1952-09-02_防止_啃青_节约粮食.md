    Preventing “Gnawing on the Green” to Conserve Grain

    Editor: After the Autumn Equinox, corn gradually matures, and farmers begin "gnawing on the green" (eating corn that is not fully ripe). Some farmers have made "gnawing on the green" a habit, while others do it to supplement their food rations. However, "gnawing on the green" has a significant impact on crop yields.

    On August 13th, Dongliuhao Village, Eleventh District, Changling County, Jilin Province, held a mass meeting specifically to discuss the issue of preventing "gnawing on the green" in order to ensure the realization of this year's bumper harvest plan. Village cadres used the method of careful accounting to explain the harms of "gnawing on the green": from the beginning of "gnawing on the green" to the maturity of the corn, there are about twenty-five days. If each person eats one meal of green corn a day, they will eat ten ears; ten ears of green corn can yield one *sheng* of autumn grain after maturity. With a total of nine hundred people in the village, this is equivalent to eating ninety *shi* of grain. This calculation shocked the masses, and they resolved not to eat green corn anymore. Regarding the sixteen households in the village with difficulties, the meeting resolved to solve their food ration problems through mutual assistance.

    防止“啃青”节约粮食
    编辑同志：玉米在立秋以后渐渐成熟，农民开始“啃青”（吃没有完全成熟的玉米）。有的农民“啃青”已成习惯，有的是为了接济口粮。但是“啃青”对庄稼的收成是有很大影响的。
    八月十三日，吉林长岭县十一区东六号村为了保证实现今年的丰产计划，专门召开群众大会，讨论了防止“啃青”的问题。村干部用算细账的办法，说明“啃青”的害处：从开始“啃青”，到玉米成熟，大约有二十五天。如果每人每天吃一顿青玉米，就要吃去十穗；十穗青玉米成熟后，能收一升秋粮。全村九百人，就等于吃掉九十石粮食。这末一算，群众都大吃一惊，决心以后不再吃青玉米。对于村里的十六家困难户，会上决议用互助互济的办法来解决他们的口粮问题。
