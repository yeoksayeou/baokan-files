Xinhua News Agency, September 5th: New Delhi Dispatch: Preparations for participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing are being extensively carried out throughout India, and an increasing number of people from all sectors of Indian society are joining this effort.

Under the call of the Indian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, "Asia Week" was held across India from August 3rd to 10th to widely publicize the great significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. From Assam, Orissa, and Calcutta in the east to Bombay on the west coast, and from East Punjab and the Patiala and East Punjab States Union in the north to the Central Provinces in the Deccan Plateau, people from all sectors of Indian society enthusiastically supported "Asia Week," with thousands participating in mass rallies in Calcutta. The mass rally held in Madras on the final day of "Asia Week" was particularly well attended.

In response to the call from the All-India Peace Council to prepare for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, various provinces (states) in India have held regional peace conferences. Among those already held in August are the Kashmir Cultural Circle Peace Conference, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union Peace Conference, the United Provinces Peace Supporters Conference, and the Bihar Province Peace Supporters Conference. These peace conferences all adopted resolutions concerning the defense of world peace, reflecting the urgent desire for peace among the people of these provinces (states).

Under the leadership of local trade union organizations, the Indian working class has enthusiastically participated in the preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The East Punjab Trade Union Congress convened the East Punjab, Patiala and East Punjab States Union, and Himachal Pradesh Trade Union Peace Conference on August 17th. Many trade unions participating in this conference decided to offer gifts to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The working class of Hyderabad, at the sixth anniversary celebration of the All-Hyderabad Trade Union Congress held on August 18th, pledged to fight for world peace alongside the working classes of all countries, and also passed a congratulatory telegram to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The West Bengal Trade Union Congress and various trade unions in Bombay have decided to nominate representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

Indian women's groups are also actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The West Bengal Women's Self-Defense League has called on its members to actively participate in the preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Women's Peace Defense Committee of the Bhowanipore area of Calcutta held a meeting and formulated a plan for preparing for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

The participation of the Indian people in the preparations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is currently being closely combined with the preparations for convening the Third All-India Peace Conference, and is continuing actively. Prominent Indian figures dedicated to the cause of peace are conducting extensive visits throughout the country to promote the preparations. The Indian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has established a working committee composed of preparatory committee members to carry out current tasks related to the preparations. The All-India Sponsors Conference for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be held in New Delhi on September 9th to discuss and formulate the issues to be raised at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and to determine the list of the Indian delegation attending the Peace Conference. The All-India Peace Conference, scheduled to be held in Jullundur, East Punjab Province, from September 12th to 14th, will become an unprecedented large-scale review of Indian peace forces and a new climax in the preparations for participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: The movement to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress is unfolding in Norway, Sweden, and Austria. According to TASS, several trade union leaders in Norway have published a statement in a democratic newspaper, calling on representatives from Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland to hold a peace conference in Oslo in mid-November, before the World People's Peace Congress, to discuss issues related to the peace movement in the Nordic countries.

In Sweden, the Swedish National Peace Committee recently issued a declaration calling on all progressive groups and individuals in Sweden to widely launch a movement to prepare for the World People's Peace Congress. The declaration stated: "The Swedish National Peace Committee warmly supports the decision to hold the World People's Peace Congress and believes that all Swedish peace fighters will contribute to the success of the Congress." The declaration continued: "We call on Swedish peace fighters to jointly and freely discuss the proposals of the World Peace Council in various forums, express their opinions, and deliberate on decisions. We ask peace fighters to elect representatives to participate in local peace conferences – these peace conferences will be held throughout the country in the months of October and November." The declaration concluded by pointing out that the preparatory movement for the World People's Peace Congress will further develop the peace movement in Sweden.

The Upper Austria Peace Council in Austria recently held a meeting in Linz. The meeting passed a resolution saying: "The selection of Vienna as the venue for the World People's Peace Congress is a great honor for our country and also gives Austrian peace fighters a great responsibility. We do not want Austria to become a bastion of the North Atlantic Group in the Alps. We strive to make our country a bastion of peace. Therefore, we welcome the holding of the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna and vow to strive for the victory of the Congress with our greatest efforts."
