　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 22nd. Disregarding our repeated warnings, the U.S. side continues to unilaterally handle prisoners of war. According to the U.S. announcement on the 20th, another 11,000 prisoners of war will be transferred to the Li承晚 [Li Chengwan] gang as "civilians" under the guise of "release" starting from October 1st. If we add the 27,000 prisoners of war who have already been unilaterally handled by the U.S. side, the number of prisoners of war unilaterally detained by the U.S. side will reach 38,000.
　　According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, these 11,000 prisoners of war are currently detained in the Masan prisoner of war camp. As everyone knows, in mid-May, our captured personnel in the Masan prisoner of war camp fiercely resisted the U.S. side's brutal act of forcibly detaining them. A United Press dispatch from Geoje Island on May 16th revealed that a U.S. military officer at the Masan prisoner of war camp admitted that a "riot" might have occurred in this prisoner of war camp. Fearing that the truth about the Masan prisoner of war camp would be revealed, Van Fleet, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, specially ordered reporters to be prohibited from visiting prisoner of war camps on the Korean mainland, including the Masan prisoner of war camp. General Clark, commander of the U.S. forces in Korea, even threatened that if "disturbances occurred" in the Masan prisoner of war camp, he would transfer the U.S. 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment, which was then on Geoje Island, to suppress them. Since then, news about the Masan prisoner of war camp has been completely blocked. Now, after more than four months of secret persecution and massacre, the U.S. side has shamelessly declared that the prisoners of war in the Masan prisoner of war camp "have been re-identified as detained civilians" and will unilaterally "release" them to the Li承晚 [Li Chengwan] gang. This clearly exposes the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war and use them as cannon fodder in the war of aggression.
　　Observers here point out that the U.S. side has suffered a large number of casualties in the small Korean War and deeply feels that it cannot afford to lose people. Therefore, it is trying its best to support the Li承晚 [Li Chengwan] puppet army, attempting to use it as a front line to reduce the losses of the U.S. army and make up for the fatal weakness of insufficient troops. Eisenhower declared on the 19th of this month that he would train more Li承晚 [Li Chengwan] puppet troops "to enable them to participate more effectively in the front-line war" so that the U.S. army "would no longer need to bear all the losses" in the unwinnable Korean War. In order to achieve this despicable goal, a large number of prisoners of war were forcibly detained and added to the Li承晚 [Li Chengwan] puppet army in batches. This is the truth about the U.S. side's so-called "release." But the facts will tell the American aggressors: if they do not honestly and quickly achieve an armistice in accordance with the principles of the agreement, they will not only not get any benefits, but will suffer even greater losses. In the first eight months of this year alone, the number of U.S. military casualties has reached 52,307, which is the price the U.S. aggressors are paying for delaying the armistice negotiations.

### 美方无耻宣布将再移交一万一千名我被俘人员给李匪帮  我观察家斥美方扣留战俘充当炮灰的阴谋

    美方无耻宣布将再移交一万一千名我被俘人员给李匪帮
    我观察家斥美方扣留战俘充当炮灰的阴谋
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美方不顾我方的一再警告，继续片面地擅自处理战俘。据美方在二十日宣布，又有一万一千名战俘将从十月一日起作为“平民”以“释放”名义移交给李承晚匪帮。如果加上已被美方片面处理的战俘二万七千人，那末美方擅自扣留的战俘将达三万八千人之多。
    据美联社东京消息说，这一万一千名战俘现在都被拘留在马山战俘营里。大家知道，在五月中旬，马山战俘营中的我方被俘人员，曾经激烈反抗美方的强迫扣留他们的暴行。合众社五月十六日从巨济岛发出的消息曾透露说，马山战俘营的一个美国军官承认在这个战俘营中可能发生“暴动”。由于害怕马山战俘营的真相泄露出来，美军第八军军长范佛里特特地下令禁止记者访问包括马山战俘营在内的朝鲜大陆上的战俘营。侵朝美军总司令克拉克并且扬言：如果马山战俘营中“发生骚动”，就要调当时在巨济岛上的美国第一八七空运步兵团前去镇压。从那时以后，关于马山战俘营的消息就被完全封锁了。现在，经过四个多月的秘密迫害与屠杀之后，美方竟然无耻地宣称马山战俘营中的战俘“已被重新甄别列为被拘平民一类”，并且要将他们片面“释放”给李承晚匪帮。这就明显地暴露出美方强迫扣留战俘充当侵略战争炮灰的阴谋。
    此间观察家指出，美方在小小的朝鲜战争中遭受了大量的伤亡，深深感到死人死不起，因此竭力扶植李承晚伪军，企图用它来挡头阵，以减少美国军队的损失，弥补兵力不足的致命弱点。艾森豪威尔在本月十九日就宣称要多训练些李承晚伪军，“使他们更有效地参加前线战争”，以便美国军队在无法打赢的朝鲜战争中“不再需要负担所有的损失”。为了达到这个卑鄙目的，大批战俘被强迫扣留下来，并被分批补充到李承晚伪军中去。这就是美方的所谓“释放”的真相。但是事实将要告诉美国侵略者：如果它不老老实实地按照已获协议的原
    则迅速实现停战，那末它不但不可能得到丝毫好处，而且将遭受更大的损失。仅仅在今年头八个月中，美国军队的伤亡数字就已经达到五万二千三百零七人，这就是美国侵略者拖延停战谈判的代价。
