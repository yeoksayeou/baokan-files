    A Passionate Warrior for Communism
    —In Memory of the 75th Anniversary of the Birth of Dzerzhinsky by Soviet A. Zhubarev
    September 11, 1952, marks the 75th anniversary of the birth of Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky, an outstanding activist of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, and a passionate fighter for communism.
    Dzerzhinsky was born on September 11, 1877, in the province of Vilna, district of Oshmyany, into a family of ten headed by Edmund-Rufin Josephovich Dzerzhinsky, a mathematics and physics teacher. Dzerzhinsky studied at the First Gymnasium in Vilna (Vilnius) from 1887.
    In 1894, while still a secondary school student, Dzerzhinsky participated in Social Democratic groups and began to study political knowledge eagerly, delving into Marxist literature. In the autumn of 1895, he joined the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party and began to associate with the revolutionary left.
    Dzerzhinsky joined the Social Democratic Party during a historically significant period. At that time, Lenin in St. Petersburg united all the Marxist groups into the "League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class," preparing to establish a revolutionary Marxist workers' party and began to link the economic struggles of workers with the political struggle against the Tsarist regime, combining socialism with the workers' movement. During this period, Comrade Stalin had already begun his revolutionary activities.
    In April 1896, Dzerzhinsky left the Vilna Gymnasium and became a professional revolutionary, dedicating his entire life to the cause of the liberation of the working class and the victory of the proletarian revolution. Endowed with the outstanding talents of an agitator, propagandist, and organizer, and exhibiting the unique self-sacrificing spirit and heroism of a proletarian revolutionary, Dzerzhinsky quickly gained prestige among the workers.
    Under the extremely difficult conditions of Tsarist autocracy, Dzerzhinsky stubbornly, tirelessly, courageously, and selflessly organized the workers of Poland and Lithuania, nurtured them with revolutionary spirit, guided their struggles, and prepared for the future victory of the revolution. He constantly explained to the workers of Poland and Lithuania that in order to conduct a common struggle against the common enemy—Russian autocracy and capitalism—it was necessary to establish a close alliance with the Russian working class. Dzerzhinsky said: "There is no difference between the interests of the Polish and Russian proletariat."
    In 1911, Dzerzhinsky wrote the following in the Bolshevik newspaper "Zvezda" (The Star): "Now 'Zvezda' is so bright and clear, we should read it regularly." The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, Lenin's "Iskra" (The Spark), the Bolshevik "Zvezda," and Lenin and Stalin's "Pravda" (Truth), determined Dzerzhinsky's revolutionary Marxist-Leninist worldview.
    The life and career of Dzerzhinsky as a professional revolutionary and underground worker demanded that he endure incredible hardships and heroic efforts. The Tsarist autocratic government felt that Dzerzhinsky was one of the greatest revolutionary activists, and therefore constantly persecuted him. Arrests, prisons, exiles, and penal servitude followed one after another. From 1897 to 1912, Dzerzhinsky was arrested six times and exiled three times, but he escaped each time. Before the Tsarist police could settle Dzerzhinsky in a new place of exile, he escaped again and rebuilt the revolutionary forces of the masses. Finally, for the sixth time, Dzerzhinsky was arrested on September 1, 1912, and imprisoned in cell number ten of the Warsaw Fortress. In May 1914, the Warsaw court sentenced Dzerzhinsky to three years of penal servitude, but after three years, the Moscow court added another six years of penal servitude. The February Revolution of 1917 liberated Dzerzhinsky from penal servitude. In the twenty-two years of his revolutionary activities, up to the February Revolution, Dzerzhinsky spent eleven years in prisons, exile, and penal servitude. But nothing could destroy his will and revolutionary spirit. In his diary written in cell number ten of the Warsaw Fortress between 1908 and 1909, Dzerzhinsky wrote: "In prison, in the boredom of solitary life, in the sadness of the world and the sadness of life, I matured. But, in any case, no doubt about the cause has ever occurred in my heart. ... Here, in prison, it is often difficult, sometimes even terrible ... However, if I need to start life anew, I will live it from the beginning as in the past."
    Dzerzhinsky firmly believed in the righteousness of Lenin and Stalin's great cause, and firmly believed in the victory of the proletarian revolution and the triumph of socialism. In a letter he sent from the Orel Central Prison in March 1915, he wrote: "When I think of what is happening now, it seems that all hope is failing everywhere, I come to the conclusion that life will thrive more powerfully and rapidly than this current failure." In 1916, Dzerzhinsky firmly stated in the Butyrka Prison: "I believe that the revolution will be victorious in no more than a year." In February 1917, workers and peasants dressed in soldiers' uniforms overthrew the Tsarist autocracy in Russia with a devastating blow. The Russian working class, led by the Bolshevik Party, formed an alliance with the poor peasants, and with the support of soldiers and sailors, overthrew the bourgeois regime, established Soviet power, created a brand-new Soviet socialist state, seized the means of production held by the bourgeoisie, and nationalized factories, manufacturing plants, land, railways, and banks. All these facts confirmed Dzerzhinsky's prophecy.
    On March 1, 1917, Dzerzhinsky was rescued from the Butyrka Prison by Moscow workers, and he immediately joined the ardent activities of the Moscow Bolshevik Party organization, becoming a loyal assistant to Lenin and Stalin in preparing for the October Socialist Revolution. He actively participated in the work of the Bolshevik Party's April Conference and the Sixth Party Congress, and he actively participated in the work of the Central Committee and the Petrograd Party Committee. He was elected as a representative to the Petrograd Soviet and a member of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. In August 1917, Dzerzhinsky, together with Comrades Stalin and Sverdlov, led the struggle of workers and revolutionary soldiers against the Kornilov rebellion. In October, he was elected to the Party Headquarters leading the armed uprising and participated in the Petrograd Soviet Revolutionary Military Committee. During the armed uprising, Comrade Stalin, in charge of the Party Headquarters, entrusted Dzerzhinsky with the most important tasks. He was entrusted with ensuring the proper defense and liaison work of Smolny, where the Petrograd Soviet and the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party were located, from where instructions, orders, and combat orders for the armed uprising were issued and implemented. In these days of world historical significance, Dzerzhinsky contributed all his wisdom and strength of will to the cause of the victory of the proletarian revolution. It was not without reason that Comrade Stalin called Dzerzhinsky a "hero of October."
    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Dzerzhinsky became a loyal comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin in the work of building a new Soviet socialist state, and a vigilant defender of the fruits of the October Revolution. On December 20, 1917, the Council of People's Commissars, at Lenin's proposal, passed a decree on the establishment of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission (Cheka) under the Council of People's Commissars to be responsible for suppressing counter-revolution and sabotage. The Party assigned Dzerzhinsky to the important task of leading the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission. Under Dzerzhinsky's leadership, the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission defended the victorious fruits of the October Revolution, became a powerful weapon of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and gloriously completed the arduous tasks it was assigned. During the difficult days of the young Soviet republic, when the United States, Britain, France, Japan, and many other countries, like a gang of robbers, launched an undeclared armed intervention against the Soviet Republic, the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, headed by Dzerzhinsky, under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin and with the active assistance of workers and peasants, guaranteed the Red Army a solid rear, ruthlessly suppressed all attacks by the enemies of the Soviet people, and straightened out the revolutionary order at the front and in the rear. Dzerzhinsky wrote in a letter to his wife: "We are soldiers on the battle post. I am living in such a situation that extreme attention and vigilance are required to win. My will is to win, although it is rarely possible to see a smile on my face, but I am convinced that the ideas and activities by which I live and work will inevitably be victorious."
    Dzerzhinsky was one of the organizers and leaders of the armed forces of the Soviet Republic. He was the Chairman of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission and People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, he led the state defense forces of the Soviet Republic, and he served as Commander of the Rear of the Southwestern Front and Chairman of the Moscow Defense Committee. Dzerzhinsky paid constant attention to strengthening the Red Army and defending the Soviet state. The work of clearing out White Guard rebels and spies from the Red Army and the Red Navy was a great contribution of Dzerzhinsky.
    After the end of the war, successively defeating the puppets of the Entente, and driving out the troops of foreign interventionists, the Soviet Republic turned to peaceful construction. The Bolshevik Party mobilized workers and peasants to eliminate economic disruption and restore the national economy. The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, under Dzerzhinsky's leadership, constantly and vigilantly watched all the conspiracies of the imperialist spies; it eradicated all attempts to organize new conspiracies, sabotage, and espionage activities. In these years, it paid great attention to the struggle to eliminate speculation and sabotage of labor discipline, and provided economic and social organs with multifaceted assistance in the cause of restoring the national economy and in the cause of protecting and improving the lives of children.
    Dzerzhinsky was a great friend of children. Even during his underground work, he said in a letter to his sister: "I love children more than anyone else. ... I often feel that even mothers do not love children as much as I do." At Dzerzhinsky's initiative, during the difficult years of destruction, the young Soviet state created a special commission of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee to fight against wandering children. Dzerzhinsky, who was burdened with heavy and huge state tasks, also served as the chairman of this commission.
    During the Soviet Republic's transition to peaceful work to restore the national economy, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government appointed Dzerzhinsky to the most important positions. On April 14, 1921, at Lenin's proposal, he was appointed People's Commissar of Railways, and concurrently Chairman of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission and People's Commissar of Internal Affairs. Dzerzhinsky, with his inherent revolutionary energy and creative enthusiasm, fought to rectify the disrupted transportation industry, and he loved this work. Dzerzhinsky's strong will, organizational talent, and ability to mobilize the masses played a huge role in restoring and developing the Soviet transportation industry.
    On February 2, 1924, at Comrade Stalin's proposal, the Soviet Central Executive Committee appointed Dzerzhinsky as Chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy of the Soviet Union, and retained the position of Chairman of the State Political Administration. Comrade Stalin wrote that Dzerzhinsky led the Supreme Council of National Economy, "He was passionate about the work of building our industry. Not knowing rest, not avoiding any troublesome work, bravely fighting against difficulties, overcoming them, contributing all his strength and all his energy to the cause entrusted to him by the Party." Dzerzhinsky implemented the policy of national industrialization of Lenin and Stalin. He strictly organized the expenditure of state funds, implemented a strict system of thrift, and strived to make industrial workers strictly protect the interests of the state, cherish every kopeck of the people, and accumulate funds for the development of heavy industry. He played an immeasurable role in the work of restoring industry to pre-war levels and in the work of building the first large factories of modern Soviet industry. In all his activities, Dzerzhinsky demonstrated a high example of Party spirit, demonstrating irreconcilability with shortcomings, he called on industrial workers to boldly launch Bolshevik criticism, and taught production leaders "to be good at seeing the truth, and to understand the truth from the masses and all those who participate in production work."
    Until the end of his life, Dzerzhinsky was always a loyal son of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, a builder of the Party's unity and power, and an indomitable fighter against the Party's enemies.
    Dzerzhinsky remained at his fighting post until the last minute of his amazing and great life. Three hours before his death, he made a passionate and moving speech at a joint meeting of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission. In this speech, he attacked the Trotsky-Zinoviev traitors with Bolshevik irreconcilability and thoroughly exposed their sabotage activities. Dzerzhinsky defended the Party's general line and the Party's ideological and organizational unity, and he angrily and irrefutably condemned the enemies of the people to their faces. At the same time, he warmly called on the participants of the conference to consolidate the Party's unity and solidarity, and to do everything possible to expand the strength and power of the Soviet state. Describing Dzerzhinsky as an excellent leader and an old Leninist guard, Comrade Stalin wrote: "... He exhausted his mind and energy for the benefit of the proletariat and for the victory of communism."
    It has been twenty-six years since the death of Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky (July 20, 1926). During this period, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin, have achieved socialist victories of world historical significance and are confidently marching towards communism.
    The indelible memory of Dzerzhinsky, a loyal student and comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin, a passionate fighter for communism, will forever live in the hearts of the Soviet people and progressive mankind throughout the world. (Attached picture)

    为共产主义而奋斗的热情战士
    ——纪念捷尔任斯基诞生七十五周年苏联阿·朱巴烈夫
    一九五二年九月十一日是布尔什维克党和苏维埃国家的卓越活动家、为共产主义而奋斗的热情战士费利克斯·爱德蒙多维奇·捷尔任斯基诞生七十五周年纪念日。
    捷尔任斯基在一八七七年九月十一日诞生于维林斯克省奥式木扬斯基郡的一个数理教员爱德蒙多—卢芬·约瑟夫维奇·捷尔任斯基的十口人的大家庭里。捷尔任斯基从一八八七年在维林斯克（维尔诺）第一中学读书。
    在一八九四年，捷尔任斯基还是一个中学生的时候，他就参加了社会民主主义小组，并开始热心学习政治知识，深入地研究马克思主义文献。一八九五年秋，他加入了立陶宛社会民主党，他和革命的左派开始接近。
    捷尔任斯基是在具有历史意义的时期中加入社会民主党的。当时列宁在彼得格勒把所有的马克思主义小组统一成为“工人阶级解放斗争协会”，准备建立革命的马克思主义工人政党，并开始把工人的经济斗争与反对沙皇制度的政治斗争联系起来，把社会主义与工人运动结合起来。在这时期，斯大林同志已开始了革命活动。
    一八九六年四月，捷尔任斯基离开了维林斯克中学，成为职业革命家，把自己的生命整个地献给工人阶级的解放事业和无产阶级革命胜利的事业，赋有鼓动家、宣传家和组织家的卓越天才，表现了无产阶级革命家独特的自我牺牲精神和英雄气概的捷尔任斯基，很快地就在工人中间获得威信。
    捷尔任斯基在沙皇专制制度的极端困难的条件下，顽强地、不知疲倦地、英勇地、奋不顾身地把波兰和立陶宛的工人群众组织起来，用革命精神来培养他们，指导他们的斗争，准备革命的未来胜利。他不断地向波兰和立陶宛工人解释，为了向共同的敌人——俄罗斯的专制制度和资本主义进行共同的斗争，必须和俄国工人阶级建立紧密的联盟。捷尔任斯基说：“波兰和俄国的无产阶级利益之间，是没有任何区别的”。
    捷尔任斯基在一九一一年间，在布尔什维克的“星”报上写过这样的话：“现在‘星’报是这样光辉鲜明，我们应该经常地读它。”马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的著作，列宁的“火星”报，布尔什维克的“星”报，和列宁、斯大林的“真理报”，决定了捷尔任斯基的革命的马克思列宁主义的世界观。
    作为职业革命家和地下工作者的捷尔任斯基的生涯和事业，要求他身受不可思议的困苦和英勇的努力。沙皇专制政府感到捷尔任斯基是最大的革命活动家之一，因此不断地迫害他。逮捕、牢狱、流放和苦役，接踵而来。自一八九七年到一九一二年间，捷尔任斯基被捕六次，流放三次，但每次都逃脱了。沙皇警察还来不及把捷尔任斯基安置到新的流放地，他就又逃脱了，并重新培养群众的革命力量。最后一次，第六次，捷尔任斯基是在一九一二年九月一日被捕的，他被关进华沙要塞的第十号监房。一九一四年五月，华沙法庭判处捷尔任斯基三年苦役，但满了三年时，莫斯科法庭又给他加判了六年苦役。一九一七年二月革命把捷尔任斯基从苦役中解放出来了。在他的革命活动的二十二年中，到二月革命时止，捷尔任斯基在牢狱、流放和苦役中度过了十一年。可是无论什么也不能摧毁他的意志和革命精神。在一九○八年——一九○九年间，捷尔任斯基在华沙要塞第十号监房所写的日记中写道：“在监狱里，在孤独生活的苦闷中，在愁着世界又愁着人生的苦闷中，我成熟了。但是，不管怎样，在我的心中，从未发生过对事业的怀疑。……在这里，在监狱中，经常是艰苦的，有时候，甚至是可怕的……然而，如果需要我重新开始生活，我将一如过去，从头生活起。”
    捷尔任斯基深信列宁、斯大林伟大事业的正义性，坚信无产阶级革命的胜利和社会主义的凯旋。在一九一五年三月他从奥勒尔中央监狱寄出的信中写道：“当我想到现时所发生的，似乎到处一切希望都在破灭的时候，我达到一个结论，即生活将比现时这一破灭更有力和更迅速地趋于繁盛。”一九一六年，捷尔任斯基在布特尔监狱中坚定地说：“我相信，不超过一年，革命就要胜利。”一九一七年二月，工人和穿着士兵外套的农民以摧毁性的打击，推翻了俄国的沙皇专制制度。以布尔什维克党为领导的俄国工人阶级和贫农结成了联盟，在士兵和水兵的拥护下推翻了资产阶级政权，建立了苏维埃政权，创立了崭新的苏维埃社会主义国家，夺取了掌握在资产阶级手中的生产工具，并把工厂、制造厂、土地、铁路和银行一律归全民所有。所有这些事实都证实了捷尔任斯基的预言。
    一九一七年三月一日，捷尔任斯基被莫斯科工人从布特尔监狱中搭救出来，他立刻参加了莫斯科布尔什维克党组织的炽烈活动，成为列宁和斯大林在准备十月社会主义革命工作中的忠实助手。他积极地参加了布尔什维克党的四月代表会议和第六次党代表大会的工作，他积极地参加了中央委员会和彼得格勒党委员会的工作，他被选为彼得格勒苏维埃代表和全俄中央执行委员会委员。一九一七年八月，捷尔任斯基和斯大林、斯维尔德洛夫同志一起，领导了反对科尔尼洛夫叛乱的工人和革命士兵的斗争。在十月，他被选入领导武装起义的党总部，并参加了彼得格勒苏维埃革命军事委员会。在武装起义的时候，负责党总部的斯大林同志，委托捷尔任斯基以最重大的任务。他被委托保证对彼得格勒苏维埃和布尔什维克党中央委员会所在地的斯莫尔尼的妥善保卫和联络工作，从那里发出指令，命令和实行武装起义的战斗命令。在这些具有世界历史意义的日子里，捷尔任斯基把自己的全部智慧和意志的力量贡献给无产阶级革命胜利的事业。斯大林同志称捷尔任斯基是“十月的英雄”不是无因的。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利后，捷尔任斯基在建设崭新的苏维埃社会主义国家的工作中，成为列宁、斯大林的忠实战友，成为十月革命果实的机警的捍卫者。一九一七年十二月二十日，人民委员会按照列宁的提议，通过了关于在人民委员会下建立全俄非常委员会以负责肃清反革命及怠工行为的法令。党委派了捷尔任斯基去担任全俄非常委员会的领导者的重任。全俄非常委员会在捷尔任斯基的领导下，保卫着十月革命的胜利果实，成为无产阶级专政的强有力的武器，光荣地完成了它所负的艰巨任务。在年轻的苏维埃共和国的艰苦日子里，即当美、英、法、日以及许多其他国家，像一群强盗似地、不宣而战地开始对苏维埃共和国实行武装干涉的时候，由捷尔任斯基负责主持的全俄非常委员会，在列宁、斯大林的领导下和在工人、农民的积极帮助下，给红军保证了坚固的后方，无情地镇压了苏维埃人民的敌人所有一切袭击，整饬了前线和后方的革命秩序。捷尔任斯基在给他的妻子的一封信中写道：“我们是在战斗岗位上的战士。我是生活在这样情况之中，为了获得胜利，需要极端的注意和警惕性。我的意志就是获得胜利，虽然极少在我的面容上能看到微笑，但是我确信，我赖以生活和工作的那种思想和活动必然获得胜利。”
    捷尔任斯基是苏维埃共和国武装力量的组织者和领导者之一。他是全俄非常委员会主席兼内务人民委员，他领导了苏维埃共和国的国家保卫部队，他曾担任西南战线后方司令，莫斯科保卫委员会主席。捷尔任斯基对加强红军和保卫苏维埃国家寄予了不断的关心。清除红军和红海军中白党叛乱者和间谍的工作，就是捷尔任斯基的巨大功绩。
    结束了战争，接连地击溃了协约国的傀儡，并把外国干涉者的军队驱逐以后，苏维埃共和国转到和平建设上去。布尔什维克党动员工人和农民努力来消除经济的破坏现象，来恢复国内的国民经济。在捷尔任斯基领导下的全俄非常委员会，不停地、机警地注视着帝国主义间谍的一切阴谋；根绝他们组织新的阴谋、破坏和特务活动的一切企图。在这些年份，它对于为消灭投机、蓄意破坏劳动纪律的斗争，寄予非常的重视，在恢复国内国民经济的事业上，在保卫和改善儿童生活的事业上，它给予经济和社会机关以多方面的帮助。
    捷尔任斯基是儿童的伟大朋友。还在地下工作时期，他在给他姐姐的一封信中说：“我比任何人都爱小孩子。……我常常觉得，甚至母亲也不像我这样热爱小孩的。”按照捷尔任斯基的创议，在破坏的困难年月里，年轻的苏维埃国家创立了全俄中央执行委员会的专门委员会，为处理流浪儿童而斗争。担负着繁重的巨大的国家工作的捷尔任斯基，又担任了这个委员会的主席。
    在苏维埃共和国过渡到恢复国民经济的和平工作时期，布尔什维克党和苏维埃政府委派捷尔任斯基担任最重要的职务。一九二一年四月十四日，按照列宁的提议，他被任为交通人民委员，并兼任全俄非常委员会主席和内务人民委员。捷尔任斯基以其素有的革命精力和创造热情，为整顿被破坏的运输业而奋斗，他热爱着这个工作。捷尔任斯基的坚强毅力和组织天才及其动员群众的本领，在恢复与发展苏联运输业上，起了巨大的作用。
    一九二四年二月二日，按照斯大林同志的提议，苏联中央执行委员会任命捷尔任斯基为苏联最高国民经济会议主席，并保留国家政治保卫局主席的职位。斯大林同志写道，捷尔任斯基领导了最高国民经济会议，“他炽热于建设我们的工业的工作。不知道休息，不避开任何烦难的工作，勇敢地和困难作斗争，克服它们，将自己的全部力量、全部精力贡献于党所委托给他的事业。”捷尔任斯基执行了列宁、斯大林的国家工业化的政策。他严格地整理了国家资金的开支，实行了严格的节约制度，努力使工业工作人员严格地保护国家的利益，爱惜人民的每一个戈比，为发展重工业积累资金。他在恢复工业到战前水平的工作中，在建立苏联现代工业的第一批大工厂的工作中，起了不可计量的作用。捷尔任斯基在自己的全部活动中表现了党性的高度范例，表现了对缺点的不可调和性，他号召工业工作人员大胆地展开布尔什维克的批评，教导生产领导者们“要善于看出真理，并且要从群众和所有参加生产工作者那里来领会真理。”
    捷尔任斯基直到生命的终结，始终是列宁、斯大林党的忠实儿子，是党的统一和威力的建设者，是反对党的敌人的不屈不挠的战士。
    捷尔任斯基直到他那令人惊叹的伟大生命的最后一分钟，始终站在战斗的岗位上。在自己死前的三小时，他在中央委员会和中央监察委员会的联席会议上作了一次热烈激动的演说。在这次演说中，他以布尔什维克的不可调和性攻击了托洛茨基——季诺维也夫叛徒们，彻底地揭穿了他们的破坏活动。捷尔任斯基保卫着党的总路线和党的思想与组织的统一，他以愤怒的、不可反驳的非难当面叱责了人民的敌人。同时，他热烈地号召大会的参加者要巩固党的统一和团结，尽力扩展苏维埃国家的力量和威力。在描写捷尔任斯基是一位优秀的领导者和老的列宁的近卫战士时，斯大林同志写道：“……他为无产阶级的利益，为共产主义的胜利而心力交瘁。”
    自费利克斯·爱德蒙多维奇·捷尔任斯基逝世
    （一九二六年七月二十日）以来，迄今已经二十六年了。在这时期，苏联人民在布尔什维克党和斯大林同志的领导下，获得了具有世界历史意义的社会主义胜利，并满怀信心地向着共产主义迈进。
    对于列宁、斯大林的忠实学生和战友、为共产主义而奋斗的热情战士捷尔任斯基的不可磨灭的记忆，将永远活在苏联人民和全世界进步人类的心里。（附图片）
