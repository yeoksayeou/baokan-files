    Question: What is the people's government's policy for dealing with unemployed workers?
    Answer: The people's government's policy for labor employment is to achieve full labor employment in stages and in a planned way. The measures for dealing with unemployed workers are: all unemployed workers will be registered universally, and they will be introduced to employment or given vocational training separately, and they will be organized to participate in production in a planned way. For unemployed workers who cannot be employed or participate in vocational training in a timely manner, those who have real difficulties in life will be settled through methods such as "work relief," "immigrant reclamation," and "production for self-help." For some old and weak unemployed workers who have completely lost their ability to work, the government will provide temporary or long-term relief according to the specific circumstances.
    Question: How will the people's government protect the jobs of employees?
    Answer: In the upcoming large-scale economic construction of the country, all public and private enterprises that meet the needs of the country and the people have a future. Therefore, the government calls on all public and private enterprises to abide by the Common Program and the policies and decrees of the People's Government, and actively develop production and business. Even if some enterprises encounter temporary difficulties, they should overcome their own difficulties through active development of production and business, and should not think of ways to lay off employees in order to protect the interests of employees and avoid increasing the number of newly unemployed workers. If it is necessary to lay off employees, it should be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law and other relevant laws and regulations. For a small number of newly unemployed workers, they can be registered, trained, and organized to transfer to other production departments at any time.
    Question: Our factory has improved labor efficiency due to the implementation of production reforms. Now the factory wants to lay off our surplus employees. Is this correct?
    Answer: All public and private enterprises should take responsibility for the surplus employees who are the result of the implementation of production reforms and the reasonable improvement of labor efficiency, and continue to pay their original wages (included in the enterprise cost), and must not lay them off. These employees can be trained in batches on a rotational basis to improve their business skills and cultural and political level, in preparation for the expansion of the enterprise or to await the unified allocation by the state. This is also beneficial to encouraging employees' enthusiasm for creative inventions and rationalization proposals.
    Question: Can the capitalist lay off employees due to a change of business?
    Answer: If some private enterprises must change their business due to economic restructuring and the original business has no future, in principle, labor should be transferred at the same time as capital. If the application for business change and the plan to open a new business have been approved by the industrial and commercial management department, and after consultation between labor and capital, a plan for employees to transfer with capital is formulated based on the plan of the new business and the conditions of the existing employees, but there are still some employees who cannot be placed in the new business, the capitalist can apply to the labor department for dismissal in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Union Law and other relevant laws and regulations, and can dismiss them according to law after being approved by the labor department.
    Question: If a private enterprise is indeed unable to continue operating, can it lay off employees?
    Answer: If a private enterprise is indeed losing too much money and is unable to continue operating, and even after consultation between labor and capital, it is still unable to develop its business and must shrink its business or close down (the shutdown should be approved by the industrial and commercial management department), it can apply to the labor department for approval and then lay off some or all of its employees; however, when the enterprise expands its business or resumes its business in the future, it should give priority to the reinstatement of the original employees.

    关于劳动就业中的一些问题
    问：人民政府对于失业工人的处理方针是什么？
    答：人民政府对于劳动就业的方针是有步骤有计划地分期实现全面的劳动就业，对于失业工人的处理办法是：凡失业工人均普遍予以登记，并分别介绍就业或予以转业训练，有计划地组织他们参加到生产中去。对于不能及时就业或参加转业训练的失业工人，生活确实困难者，则采取“以工代赈”、“移民开荒”、“生产自救”等方式予以安置。对于某些完全丧失劳动力的老弱失业工人，政府则根据具体情况予以临时救济或长期救济。
    问：人民政府将怎样保障在职职工的职业问题？
    答：在国家即将开始大规模经济建设中，一切适合国家和人民需要的公私营企业都是有前途的。因此，政府号召一切公私营企业均应遵守共同纲领和人民政府的政策法令，积极发展生产和营业。某些企业即令一时发生困难，也应从积极发展生产和发展营业中来克服本身的困难，不得从解雇职工上想办法，以保障职工利益，避免增加新的失业工人。如必须解雇职工时，则应按工会法及其他有关法令的规定办理。对于少数新的失业工人，随时可进行登记、训练，组织他们转入其他生产部门。
    问：我厂因为实行生产改革而提高了劳动效率，现在厂方要解雇我们多余的职工。这样做对吗？
    答：一切公私营企业，对于因实行生产改革、合理地提高了劳动效率而多余出来的职工，均应由原企业单位包下来，照旧发给原工资（计入企业成本），不得解雇。对于这些职工可进行分批轮训，提高他们的业务技术与文化政治水平，以备本企业扩大时使用或听候国家统一调配。这样做，对于鼓励职工的创造发明和提出合理化建议的积极性也是有好处的。
    问：资方可否因转业而解雇职工？
    答：某些私营企业因经济改组关系，本业确无前途必须转业者，原则上应该是劳动随资本同时转业。如果转业申请和计划开设的新业已得工商管理部门核准，又经过劳资双方协商，根据新业的计划和现有职工的条件拟出职工随资本转移方案后，仍有一部分确实无法在新业中安置的职工，资方可按照工会法及其他有关法令的规定向劳动部门申请解雇，经劳动部门批准后，得依法解雇。
    问：私营企业如确实无力继续经营时，可否解雇职工？
    答：私营企业如确属亏本过甚，无力继续经营，虽经劳资协商，仍无法开展业务，必须紧缩营业或歇业时（歇业应经工商管理部门批准），可申请劳动部门批准后，得解雇一部或全部职工；但将来该企业单位扩大营业或复业时，应尽先使原职工复工。
