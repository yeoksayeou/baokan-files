Vigorously eliminate obstacles hindering Sino-Japanese trade. Strengthen ties with Chinese trade organizations.

(2) Concerning promoting and strengthening the national movement to promote Japan-China trade: Dispatch trade representatives to directly discuss the details of conducting trade with China. Through various activity methods, absorb more people to participate in the movement to promote Japan-China trade, such as holding lectures, conducting written propaganda, launching signature campaigns, soliciting opinions on Japan-China trade from all walks of life, requesting local councils to pass resolutions on promoting Japan-China trade, and calling on all Japanese people not to vote for candidates who oppose Japan-China trade in the general election, and strengthen cooperation with other organizations.

(3) Concerning the establishment of a trade advisory department: Establish a trade advisory department within the Japan-China Trade Promotion Conference in various places - a central advisory department in Tokyo and local advisory departments in various places. The advisory department is a consulting agency for those in various places and industries who want to trade with China, responsible for sorting out and guiding the requirements of various places and merchants for goods to be imported and exported according to the Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

The Sino-Japanese trade agreement is a completely economic exchange agreement that implements the principles of peace and equality. As long as one sincerely hopes for peace and hopes to improve peaceful industry and national life, no one will oppose the purpose of this agreement.

The declaration went on to point out: The Yoshida government is negotiating with the United States, ignoring public opinion, and obstructing Japan-China trade in every possible way. Therefore, in order to fully realize the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, it must be supported by a strong national movement to achieve its goal.

The declaration concluded: The Japanese people unanimously demand that the Japanese government clearly adopt policies that guarantee the interests of the Japanese people and abolish illegal export restrictions. We call on the people of the whole country to unite all forces and vow to continue and expand the national movement to remove trade restrictions until the goal is achieved.

    日中贸易促进会议举行全国大会
    决争取实现中日贸易协议
    【新华社六日讯】东京迟到消息：日中贸易促进会议自从在五月二十二日和六月十一日先后召开了第一、二次全国大会以后，会务有了迅速的发展。大阪、神户、京都、名古屋等大都市和福井、石川、宫城、福冈等县，纷纷筹备或成立了日中贸易促进会议的地方组织。在这种形势下，日中贸易促进会议于七月十八日在东京举行了第三次全国大会，讨论整顿和扩充组织的问题与实施中日贸易协议的方针。出席这次会议的有包括来自北起北海道和南至九州岛的全国各地代表三百数十人。参加这次大会的来宾中有日中友好协会会长风见章和日本共产党代表、参议员兼岩传一等多人。
    大会在推选山本熊一、平野义太郎两人为主席之后，首先听取了在北京签订中日贸易协议的日本代表高良富、帆足计、宫腰喜助的报告，并放映签订这个协议的纪录影片。接着，大会讨论和通过了下列议案：
    （一）关于争取实现中日贸易协议的具体方策：展开实现中日贸易协议的各项初步工作，统计输出和输入货物的数量，整理各企业所提出的要求。大力消除阻碍进行中日贸易的障碍。加强与中国贸易机构的联系。
    （二）关于推进并加强促进日中贸易的国民运动：派遣贸易代表直接和中国讨论进行贸易的细节。通过各种活动方式，吸收更多的人参加促进日中贸易运动，例如，举行讲演会，进行文字宣传，发动签名运动，征求各界人士对日中贸易的意见，要求各地方议会通过关于促进中日贸易的决议，并号召所有的日本人民在大选时不投反对日中贸易的候选人的票，并加强与其他团体的合作。
    （三）关于设立贸易顾问部问题：在各地日中贸易促进会议内设立贸易顾问部——东京设中央顾问部，各地方设地方顾问部。顾问部是各地和各行业中要求与中国进行贸易者的咨询机构，负责把各地和各商家对于准备输入和输出的商品的要求，根据中日贸易协议加以整理和指导。
    （四）关于设立日本促进国际贸易委员会：根据莫斯科国际经济会议的决定，设立日本促进国际贸易委员会。由日中贸易促进会议和日苏贸易促进会议合作，设立特别委员会，负责筹备组织工作。
    大会并发表宣言说：大会在听取了帆足计、宫腰喜助和高良富三人的报告之后，对新中国对日本人民的友爱和中国一贯的和平政策加深了信心和感激。中日贸易协议完全是贯彻着和平与平等的原则的经济交流的协定。只要是真心希望和平，希望提高和平工业和国民生活的人，谁也不会反对这个协议的宗旨。
    宣言接着指出：吉田政府和美国进行谈判，忽视民意，百般阻挠日中贸易。因此，要使中日贸易协议完全实现，必须有强力的国民运动的支援才能达到目的。
    宣言最后说：日本国民一致要求日本政府明确地采取保障日本国民利益的政策，撤除非法的出口限制措施。我们向全国人民号召，团结一切力量，宣誓要继续并扩大撤除贸易限制的国民运动，直至达到目的为止。
