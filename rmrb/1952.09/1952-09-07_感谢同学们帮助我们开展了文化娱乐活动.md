    Thank You, Classmates, for Helping Us Carry Out Cultural and Recreational Activities

    Editor's Note: The following is a letter from three soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, Feng An, Li Qing, and Cai Peng, reflecting the urgent need of the broad masses of soldiers for cultural and recreational activities, and the help classmates are providing to carry out these activities.

    Comrade Editor: Our unit's recreational activities are very poor.

    Since the beginning of July, classmates from Changxindian Railway Middle School have come to our unit every Tuesday and Thursday to teach soldiers how to sing and do group dances, sometimes teaching until they have to feel their way back in the dark at night. This has deeply moved our comrades. Some people who were unwilling to participate in activities in the past have now learned several dances. They say, "The classmates are so enthusiastic about teaching us, if we don't study hard, how can we be worthy of them!" With the enthusiastic help of the classmates, the soldiers in our unit have generally learned several kinds of dances and are happily dancing during their daily recreation time. This is a big step forward for our recreational activities. We are very grateful to the classmates for their help. Everyone says, "We must use our work and study achievements to thank the classmates."

    Comrade Editor: After our unit came to the outskirts of Beijing, due to environmental conditions, recreational work was not carried out very well. Later, we established contact with the Agricultural University. During our recreation time, we went to the university to play on the horizontal bars, do high jumps and long jumps, and play basketball, and recreational activities began.

    It is particularly worth mentioning that during the "August 1st" Army Day, students and villagers from the Agricultural University held a joint celebration meeting with us. The students gave us eggplants and tomatoes that they had grown themselves, and taught us group dances, expressing their love for our troops. In this way, they helped with the recreational work of the troops. Even the cooking班, which was always considered a dead zone, was activated. In just over a month, we held three joint parties with the Agricultural University and watched two movies. Every Saturday night, we either watch a movie or do group dances. The students are very patient and will not stop until they have taught us every dance. Encouraged by the high spirit of serving the soldiers, the students helped us learn six dances, including the Unity Dance, and our recreational activities have become lively. Therefore, we are very grateful for the help of the students from the Agricultural University and want to learn from their spirit. We hope that their spirit of serving the soldiers can continue to be carried forward in their future work serving the motherland.

    Comrade Editor: Since the students from a branch of the Communist Youth League of the Affiliated Women's Middle School of Beijing Normal University taught us to dance in the rain on August 13th, the recreational work of our company has been greatly advanced. In the past, the recreational work of our company was not carried out well. With the help of the students, now our company's deputy company commander Liu Huiqi and every cadre take the lead in dancing. Every soldier happily dances the dances taught by the students. Recreational life has become lively.

    The students are very patient in helping us. Soldier Zhu Baoniu from a certain class in our company could not learn the sheet music when learning the Carnival Dance on September 3rd, even though everyone else could dance. At that time, classmate Liu Yuanchun unhesitatingly called Comrade Zhu Baoniu to the side and taught him sentence by sentence. After learning the sheet music, he still couldn't dance the steps, and his legs wouldn't listen to him. Classmate Liu Yuanchun immediately squatted down, fiddled with his feet, and taught him how to move. She guided him carefully and patiently, time after time. It was very hot, but she didn't feel tired at all. She wiped the sweat from her forehead with a handkerchief and then continued to teach.

    Thanks to the enthusiastic help of classmate Liu Yuanchun, Comrade Zhu Baoniu can now sing and dance. He said with emotion, "I will always be grateful to the classmates for teaching me so enthusiastically. In the future, I must study culture hard, quickly improve my military skills, and use my study achievements to thank the classmates."

### 感谢同学们帮助我们开展了文化娱乐活动

专栏：读者来信

    感谢同学们帮助我们开展了文化娱乐活动
    编者按：这里发表的是人民解放军战士酆安、李清、蔡蓬三位战士的来信，反映了广大的战士对文化娱乐的迫切要求，和同学们帮助他们开展这一活动的情况。
    编辑同志：我部文娱活动开展得很差。
    长辛店铁路中学同学，自七月初到现在，每星期二、四来我部教战士唱歌和跳集体舞，有时教到晚上摸着黑路回去。这些都深深地感动了同志们，过去有些不愿意活动的人，现在也学会了几个舞蹈，他们说：“同学们这样热心教我们，如果不好好学，怎么对得起他们！”在同学们的热心帮助下，我部战士已普遍学会了好几种舞蹈，每天游戏时间都愉快地跳着。文娱活动向前推进了一大步。我们很感谢同学们对我们的帮助。大家都说：“一定要以我们的工作、学习成绩来感谢同学们。”
    装甲部队某部战士　蔡蓬
    编辑同志：我们部队来到京郊后，由于环境条件的关系，文娱工作没有很好的开展。以后，我们与农业大学取得了联系，游戏时间，我们便到该校去玩单双杠，跳高跳远，打篮球，文娱活动也就开展起来了。
    这里特别值得提出的是“八一”建军节时，农业大学的同学、老乡和我们开了联欢庆祝大会，同学们将他们自己种出来的茄子、西红柿赠送给我们，并教我们跳集体舞，表示对我们部队的热爱。这样，帮助了部队的文娱工作，一向认为的死角——炊事班，也开展起来了。仅一个多月的时间，我们和农业大学开了三次联欢会，看过两次电影。每个星期六晚上，不是看电影，便是跳集体舞。同学们非常耐心，每一个舞都要教会我们才停止。同学们在高度的为兵服务的精神鼓舞下，帮助我们学会了团结舞等六个舞蹈，我们的文娱活动就这样活跃起来了。因此，我们很感谢农业大学同学们的帮助，并要向他们这种精神学习。希望他们这种为兵服务的精神，能在今后为祖国服务的工作中继续发扬。
    解放军某部战士　李清
    编辑同志：自从八月十三日北京师范大学附属女子中学青年团一分支的同学们冒雨教我们跳舞以后，把我连的文娱工作大大推进了一步。从前，我连的文娱工作开展得不好。经同学们的帮助后，现在我连副连长刘会起及每个干部带头来跳舞。每个战士都愉快地跳着同学们所教的舞。文娱生活就活跃起来了。
    同学们是很耐心地帮助我们的。我连某班战士朱保妞，在九月三日学狂欢舞时，别人都会跳了，他还不会谱。当时，刘元春同学毫不犹豫地把朱保妞同志叫到旁边，一句一句的来教他。学完歌谱后，在学步子时他又跳不来了，两条腿不听使唤。刘元春同学马上蹲下来拨弄他的脚，教他怎样动作。就这样的细心、耐心，一次一次地指导。天气挺热，她一点也不觉得累，用手帕擦掉头上的汗珠，接着又来教。
    由于刘元春同学的热心帮助，朱保妞同志也会唱也会跳了。他感动地说：“同学们这样热心地教我，我永远是感谢的。今后一定要努力学习文化，迅速提高军事技术，拿我的学习成绩来答谢同学们。”
    某部战士　酆安
