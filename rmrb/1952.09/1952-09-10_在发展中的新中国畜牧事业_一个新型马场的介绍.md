In the developing economic construction of our country, the livestock industry is developing day by day. Here is an introduction to State-Run Horse Farm No. 3. This horse farm's management policy, equipment, and methods of raising and managing breeding stock all adopt the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. It has world-renowned Soviet breeding horses for both riding and draft; Shorthorn breeding cattle for both milk and meat; and Merino breeding sheep for both wool and meat, used for purebred breeding and to cultivate new breeds through crossbreeding. In the past two years, this horse farm has achieved remarkable results in the above work.

Under the guidance of the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, New China's livestock industry has already made remarkable achievements. This provides favorable conditions for our country's future large-scale development of agriculture and other construction. (Attached pictures)

Soviet horses are world-renowned. These horses are tall, strong, and fast, making them excellent riding and draft horses.

Veterinary staff regularly check the health of the breeding horses.

This is a Mongolian breeding horse. The advantage of Mongolian horses is that they are hardy, resistant to disease, and adaptable to various climates. They are also world-famous good horses.

This is a herd of Shorthorn breeding cattle. These cattle are strong and stocky, making them excellent for both milk and meat.

Daily "grooming" is one of the most important tasks to ensure healthy development of horses. This can protect the skin of the horses and prevent disease.

This is a group of "Merino" breeding lambs at the horse farm. These sheep can grow to weigh one hundred fifty to one hundred sixty pounds. Each sheep produces an average of twenty-eight pounds of wool per year, making them excellent for both wool and meat.

This is a first-generation hybrid lamb bred through crossbreeding. This sheep possesses many unique advantages.

The breeding station uses artificial insemination for crossbreeding. According to statistics from May of this year, it has exceeded the number of inseminations planned for the entire year by more than four times. This is a technician at the breeding station checking the sperm before insemination.

The horse farm has a farm dedicated to producing horse feed, all with mechanized equipment. This is a triple-gang mower tractor mowing grass. With this machine, thirty to thirty-five mu of grass can be mowed per hour.

Soviet-style stables are well-ventilated and insulated. The interior is equipped with a workshop, making it a new type of stable. After eating their fill of green grass, this group of horses is returning to their comfortable homes to rest.

Yang Run, a liberated farmer from Zhangbei County, borrowed a Mongolian horse from the People's Government. Last year, after his mare was bred at the breeding station, she gave birth to a hybrid foal this spring. Now the mare is pregnant again.

    在发展中的新中国畜牧事业
    ——一个新型马场的介绍
    作为我国经济建设组成部分之一的畜牧事业，一天天地在发展着。这里介绍的是国营第三号马场。这个马场的经营方针、设备以及对种畜的饲养管理的方法，都采取了苏联的先进经验。这里有乘挽兼用的世界驰名的苏联种马；有乳肉兼用的短角牛种牛和毛肉兼用的美利奴种羊，用来进行纯种繁殖，并以杂交方法培育新的品种。两年来，这个马场在上述工作中已获得显著成绩。
    新中国的畜牧事业在苏联先进经验的指导下，已经有了显著的成就，这给我国今后大规模发展农业及其它建设，都提供了有利条件。（附图片）
    苏联马是世界驰名的。这种马体形高大，力气大，跑的速度快，是一种乘挽兼用的良马。
    兽医工作人员定期检查种马的健康状况。
    这是蒙古种马。蒙古马的优点是能吃苦耐劳，对疾病的抵抗力大，并能适应各种气候，也是世界著名的良马。
    这是短角牛种牛群。这种牛力气大，体形肥壮，是一种乳肉兼用的牛。
    每天“刷拭”是保证马匹健康发育的重要工作之一，这样可以保护马匹的皮肤，避免疾病。
    这是马场的“美利奴”种羊羔群。这种羊体重可生长到一百五、六十斤，一只羊平均年产羊毛二十八斤，是一种毛肉兼用的羊。
    这是用杂交法生育的一代杂种羊羔，这种羊具备有很多独特的优点。
    配种站以人工授精的方法进行杂交。据今年五月份统计，已超过全年计划配种数目的四倍多。这是配种站的技术人员在配种前进行检查精虫的情形。
    马场有一个专门生产马粮的农场，全部是机械化设备，这是三联割草拖拉机正在割草时的情形，用这种机器每小时可以割草三十亩到三十五亩。
    苏联式马厩，空气流通，能保温，室内并设有工作室，是一种最新型的马厩。这群马匹在吃饱青草后正回到它们舒适的家舍里来休息。
    张北县翻身农民杨润从人民政府贷了一匹蒙古马，去年他的马在配种站配交后，今年春天生了一匹杂种驹，现在母马又已怀孕了。
