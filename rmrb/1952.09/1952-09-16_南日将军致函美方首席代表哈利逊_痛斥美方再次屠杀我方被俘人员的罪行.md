Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 15th: General Nam Il, Chief Representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Delegation to the Armistice Negotiations, sent a letter to U.S. Chief Representative Harrison on September 15th, condemning the barbarous crime of the U.S. side in slaughtering our captured personnel once again on September 12th. The full text of General Nam Il's protest is as follows:

Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

Your side has yet to provide any explanation for the barbarous acts of repeatedly abusing and killing our captured personnel. On September 12th, your side once again openly slaughtered our captured personnel, killing one and wounding seven. I hereby lodge a serious protest with you. Your side must bear full and absolute responsibility for this and all previous war crimes of slaughtering prisoners of war, which completely tear up the Geneva Convention.

Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army
Delegation Chief Representative General Nam Il
September 15, 1952

On September 15th, our Chief Liaison Officer lodged a serious protest with the other side regarding the incident of the U.S. side dropping insulting leaflets into the Panmunjom conference area on the 14th. The U.S. side not only violated the conference area agreement by distributing leaflets in the conference area, but U.S. military police in the conference area even picked up these leaflets and openly provoked our military police. Our Chief Liaison Officer sternly pointed out that the other side's use of the conference area for hostile actions in violation of the agreement has reached an increasingly serious degree. For the benefit of the armistice negotiations, the other side must immediately cease this behavior that violates the agreement. The other side, in the face of solid and undeniable evidence, expressed its willingness to prevent the occurrence of leaflet dropping incidents in the conference area in the future, but still attempted to deny the rude and provocative behavior of its military police. At the insistence of our Chief Liaison Officer, the liaison officers of both sides conducted a joint investigation, questioning the military police of both sides present at the time and the witnesses to the incident. Although the other side's military police still tried to deny it, our military police and the witnesses at the time irrefutably established the provocative behavior of the other side. Our Chief Liaison Officer pointed out that the other side, both individually and collectively, must bear full responsibility for this rude and provocative action.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 15th: While endlessly delaying the armistice negotiations, the U.S. side continues to slaughter prisoners of war in prisoner-of-war camps who firmly demand to be repatriated home. From behind the U.S. news blockade, another bloody incident has been revealed: On September 12th, in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, another of our captured personnel was killed and seven were wounded. According to the U.S. side's own admitted figures, in the 33 days since August 11th, as many as 135 of our captured personnel have been killed or wounded. Although the U.S. side has tried every means to confuse the truth about the slaughter, their official announcements still have to admit in vague terms that two platoons of South Korean troops entered the camp to stop shouting prisoners of war. Obviously, this means that the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit army used guns and bayonets to suppress the prisoners of war's calls to go home, killing and wounding eight of them. U.S. chief negotiator Harrison recently shamelessly used the new pretext of prisoners of war needing "sanctuaries" in the conference to defend his unreasonable claim to forcibly detain prisoners of war. But based solely on the materials that the U.S. side has been forced to reveal since August 11th, in the "sanctuaries" claimed by Harrison, many prisoners of war have been slaughtered for "singing songs" and "gathering together"; some prisoners of war have been killed and injured by falling rocks while being forced to perform dangerous hard labor; some prisoners of war have been "carelessly" shot by U.S. troops; and some prisoners of war have committed suicide because they could not bear the persecution of the U.S. side. The "sanctuary" so-called by Harrison is such a living hell!

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 15th: On September 14th, the U.S. side again seriously violated the conference area agreement by dropping insulting leaflets in various places within the Panmunjom conference area. This matter has been confirmed by a joint investigation by the security officers of both sides. Even more absurdly, U.S. military police Staff Sergeant Swinner picked up this leaflet and instructed Police Private Samens to hand it over to our military police Kim Pil-soo, openly provoking him. Our military police immediately and solemnly rejected it. This matter has also been confirmed by the translator of our security officer who witnessed the incident at the time. At the liaison officer meeting between the two sides on the 15th, our Chief Liaison Officer, Colonel Zhang Chunshan, lodged a serious protest with the other side's Chief Liaison Officer, McCassey, regarding this matter, and pointed out that the other side's use of the conference area for hostile actions in violation of the agreement has reached an increasingly serious degree. For the benefit of the armistice negotiations, the other side must immediately cease this behavior that violates the agreement. Under our solemn accusation, McCassey had to admit the act of violating the agreement by dropping insulting leaflets in the conference area, and guaranteed that he would "make every effort to avoid such incidents" in the future. However, regarding the provocative behavior of his military police, although it had been unanimously confirmed by the relevant witnesses during the investigation, McCassey still strongly claimed that he would "study the records" in an attempt to deny responsibility. Colonel Zhang Chunshan immediately pointed out that the evidence in this matter is conclusive and undeniable. The other side, both collectively and individually, must be held responsible.

Recently, the U.S. side's deliberate provocative actions in violation of the conference area agreement have reached an undisguised and unscrupulous degree. Since August of this year, the U.S. side has shelled the conference area and repeatedly sent aircraft to fly over the conference area. Recently, the U.S. side has even openly used the conference area as a channel for the coming and going of spies, some of whom have been captured by our army. All of this is clearly part of the U.S. side's overall plan to stifle the armistice negotiations.

    南日将军致函美方首席代表哈利逊
    痛斥美方再次屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军停战谈判代表团首席代表南日将军，在九月十五日致函美方首席代表哈利逊，痛斥美方在九月十二日又一次屠杀我方被俘人员的野蛮罪行。南日将军抗议全文如下：
    联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    你方对于历次虐杀我方被俘人员的野蛮行为，至今未作任何交代。九月十二日，你方又一次公然屠杀我方被俘人员，打死一人，打伤七人。对此，我向你提出严重抗议。对此次及以往历次屠杀战俘的彻底撕毁日内瓦公约的战争罪行，你方必须负完全和绝对的责任。
        朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军
                代表团首席代表南日将军
                一九五二年九月十五日
    九月十五日我方首席联络官就美方在十四日向板门店会场区投发侮辱性的传单的事件，向对方提出严重抗议。美方不但破坏会场区协议，向会场区散发传单，而且美方会场区军事警察更拾取此项传单，公然向我方军事警察进行挑衅。我方首席联络官严词指出：对方利用会场区进行违反协议的敌对行动已达到日益严重的程度。为了停战谈判的利益，对方必须立即停止这种违反协议的行为。对方在证据确实，不容抵赖的情况下，表示愿在今后防止向会场区投发传单的事件的发生，但仍企图否认对方军事警察的无礼挑衅行为。在我方首席联络官的坚持下，双方联络官进行了共同调查，询问了当时的双方军事警察和事件发生时的人证，虽然对方军事警察犹图抵赖，但我方军事警察和当时人证都无可争辩地确立了对方的挑衅行为。我方首席联络官指出对方个人与集体必须对这种无礼挑衅行动负完全的责任。
    【新华社开城十五日电】美方在无休止地拖延停战谈判的同时，继续在战俘营内屠杀坚决要求遣返回家的战俘。从美方新闻封锁的障壁后面，又透露出一次新的血腥事件：九月十二日在巨济岛战俘营内我方被俘人员又被打死一名，打伤七名。仅据美方自己供认的数字，自八月十一日以来的三十三天内，我方被俘人员被打死打伤已达一百三十五名之多。尽管美方想尽办法来混淆屠杀的真相，但他们的官方公告还是不得不含糊其词地供认：两个排的南朝鲜军进入营场制止了叫喊的战俘。显然，这就是说李承晚匪军用枪弹刺刀压平战俘要求回家的呼声，打死打伤了他们中的八名。美方谈判首席代表哈利逊最近在会内恬不知耻地以战俘需求“避难所”的新藉口，为其强迫扣留战俘的无理主张辩护。但是仅据美方自八月十一日以来被迫透露的材料来看，在哈利逊所声称的“避难所”里，许多战俘因为“唱歌曲”、“聚集在一起”而遭到屠杀；有些战俘之被迫从事危险苦役而被坠石打死、打伤；有些战俘被美军“失慎”枪伤；有些战俘因不堪美方迫害而自杀。哈利逊所谓的“避难所”，就是这样一个活地狱！
    【新华社开城十五日电】九月十四日美方又严重破坏会场区协议，在板门店会场区内各处投发侮辱性传单，此事经双方安全军官共同调查证实。更荒唐的是，美方军事警察上士斯文纳竟拾取此项传单，授意警察上等兵萨门斯交给我方军事警察金弼洙，公然进行挑衅。我方军事警察当即予以严正拒绝。此事也经当时在场目睹的我方安全军官的翻译予以证实。在十五日双方联络官会议上，我方首席联络官张春山上校就此事向对方首席联络官麦卡塞提出严重抗议，并且指出：对方利用会场区进行违反协议的敌对行动已到达日益严重的程度，为了停战谈判的利益，对方必须立即停止此种违反协议的行为。在我方严正指责下，麦卡塞不得不承认在会场区内投发侮辱性传单的违反协议行为，并且保证今后“尽一切努力避免此种事件”。但是麦卡塞对其军事警察公然进行挑衅的行为，虽经调查有关证人一致证实，仍强称要“研究记录”，企图抵赖责任。张春山上校当即指出：此事证据确凿，不容抵赖。对方集体和个人都得负责。
    近来，美方蓄意违反双方会场区协议的挑衅行为已到达明目张胆、肆无忌惮的地步。自今年八月以来，美方曾炮击会场区，连续多次派遣飞机飞越会场区。最近，美方更公然把会场区作为特务的来往通道，其中若干名特务并已被我军捕获。这一切显然是美方整个扼杀停战谈判计划中的一个部分。
