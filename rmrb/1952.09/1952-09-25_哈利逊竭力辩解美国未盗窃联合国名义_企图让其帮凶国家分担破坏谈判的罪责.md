Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 24th: At the plenary session of the Korean armistice negotiations between the two delegations on the 20th, US chief delegate Harrison desperately defended the United States against stealing the name of the United Nations. He asked, feigning innocence, "Do you still insist that our side is in fact at odds with the people of the world?" General Nam Il immediately gave him an affirmative answer, because world opinion and international law had already given the same answer to his question.

The whole world knows that at dawn on June 25, 1950, the Lee Seung-man bandit army crossed the 38th parallel and launched a full-scale war. On the morning of the 27th, Truman declared that he had ordered the US armed forces to enter the Korean War. It was not until the afternoon of the 27th that the United Nations Security Council convened under US duress. The US representative attempted to use the Security Council to hang a "United Nations" sign on the US armed forces that had already brazenly invaded Korea. However, the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security Council, did not participate in the meeting, and the other major power, the People's Republic of China, was still excluded from the United Nations. Any resolution passed by the Security Council at that time was absolutely illegal. However, the US aggressors have since fought under the banner of the United Nations in the Korean War. Illegal usurpation is called theft. This is an undeniable historical fact.

In order to decorate the facade of the "United Nations Forces" and scrape together cannon fodder, the United States used all its pressure to gradually drive soldiers from more than a dozen countries to Korea. Everyone knows that, having suffered heavy losses on the Korean battlefield, some of the United States' accomplice nations have more than once clamored to break up the partnership. Only because Washington constantly exerts high pressure do they reluctantly keep their troops in Korea to continue dying.

In his shameless defense, Harrison recited a whole string of countries that were driven by the United States to pay cannon fodder or supply materials to maintain the US war of aggression against Korea, attempting to make them share the blame for the US sabotage of the armistice and the massacre of prisoners of war. But Harrison overlooked a simple fact before him. The so-called "United Nations Command Delegation" beside him, except for a South Korean puppet purely for decoration, were all American generals; the large number of staff officers sitting behind him were all American soldiers. Some of the United States' "allies," under pressure from their people demanding an armistice, have repeatedly complained that they know nothing about the progress of the armistice negotiations. Three months ago, the dissatisfaction of Britain, the number one accomplice, developed to the point of open quarrel, demanding to be involved in the armistice negotiations. As a result, Washington allowed Britain to send a general named Susmith to the "United Nations Command" to serve as a nominal "Deputy Chief of Staff," requiring him to "report directly to Clark."

The dictatorial US generals, in addition to scraping up cannon fodder, rarely pay attention to the so-called "United Nations." When Harrison suddenly talked at length about the "United Nations" to cover up for the United States, he did not even know which countries were included in the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea." In his prepared remarks, he confused the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea" of 1950 with the so-called "United Nations Temporary Commission on Korea" of 1947, and referred to Turkey, one of the members of the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea," as Syria, and casually added Canada. The American aggressors who sell dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton cannot even distinguish the sheep's head, and as a result, they hang out a dog's leg. This is the true color of the Harrison clique.

As long as all prisoners of war are allowed to go home, the Korean armistice, which is eagerly hoped for by the world, can be realized immediately. But when Harrison comes to Panmunjom once a week, he is only keen on shameless propaganda that has nothing to do with the prisoner of war issue. For the American representatives, it is very easy to travel to Panmunjom four times a month by helicopter. But in the battlefield, the US military lost more than 10,000 people and the British military lost more than 1,400 people in August alone. At the same time, tens of millions of prisoners of war and their families do not know when they will be reunited, or whether they will be reunited at all. The world situation is becoming more tense because of the US's steps to sabotage negotiations and expand the war. No matter how Harrison pleads innocent, the people of the world will not forgive the heinous crimes of the small handful of American war-mongers and arms dealers he represents.

    哈利逊竭力辩解美国未盗窃联合国名义
    企图让其帮凶国家分担破坏谈判的罪责
    【新华社开城二十四日电】在二十日的朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，美方首席代表哈利逊竭力辩解美国没有盗窃联合国的名义。他装得颇为无辜地问道：“难道你们还坚称我方事实上是与世界人民为敌吗？”南日将军立刻给了他一个肯定的答复，因为世界公论，国际法律对他的问题早已作了同样的答复。
    全世界都知道：一九五零年六月二十五日的拂晓，李承晚匪军侵越三八线，发动了全面战争。二十七日上午，杜鲁门声明他已命令美国武装部队投入朝鲜战争。直到二十七日下午，联合国安全理事会才在美国劫持下开会。美国代表企图利用安全理事会给已经悍然侵入朝鲜的美国武装力量挂上一块“联合国”的招牌。但是安全理事会常任理事国苏联并未参加会议，另一大国中华人民共和国仍被摒除在联合国之外，安全理事会当时通过的任何决议是绝对非法的。而美国侵略者却从此在侵朝战争中打起了联合国的旗帜。非法僭取，是谓盗窃，这是不容置辩的历史事实。
    为了装点出“联合国军”的门面和拼凑炮灰，美国用尽压力陆续驱使了十多个国家的士兵来到朝鲜。谁都知道，由于在朝鲜战场碰得头破血流，美国的若干帮凶国家曾不止一次地嚷闹拆伙。仅仅是因为华盛顿不断施用高压，它们才三心二意地把部队留在朝鲜继续送死。
    哈利逊在他的无耻辩解中，念出了一整串被美国驱使着交纳炮灰或供给物资来维持美国侵朝战争的国家，企图要它们来分担美国破坏停战、屠杀战俘的罪责。但哈利逊却忽略了他眼前的一个简单事实。在他身旁的所谓“联合国军代表团”，除了一个纯供装饰之用的南朝鲜傀儡外，全是美国将军；坐在他后面的大批参谋也都是清一色的美国军人。美国的若干“同盟国”，曾因人民要求停战的压力而不止一次地抱怨它们对停战谈判的进行一无所闻。三个月前，头号帮凶英国的不满发展到了公开争吵的程度，要求过问停战谈判。结果华盛顿允许英国派遣一个名叫苏斯米斯的将军驻到“联合国军总司令部”，担任一个“副参谋长”的挂名差事，还要他“直接向克拉克负责。”
    专断独行的美国将军们，除搜罗炮灰外，就很少理会所谓“联合国”。当哈利逊突然侈谈“联合国”来替美国遮羞时，他甚至对所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”包含那些国家都弄不清楚。在他事先准备好的发言稿中，他把一九五零年的所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”和一九四七年的所谓“联合国朝鲜临时委员会”混为一谈，把所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”的委员之一土耳其说成是叙利亚，还随便地添上了一个加拿大。挂羊头卖狗肉的美国侵略者们连羊头都弄不清楚，结果挂出了一条狗腿来，这就是哈利逊之流的本色。
    只要让所有战俘回家，举世殷望的朝鲜停战立即可以实现。但当哈利逊每周一次来到板门店时，他却只热中于与战俘问题毫不相干的无耻宣传。对于美国代表们，一个月乘坐直升飞机到板门店旅行四次是很轻易的事。但是仅仅八月一个月内，在战场上美军已损失了一万多人，英军损失了一千四百多人。同时，千万战俘和他们的家属不知何日能够重聚，也不知是否还能重聚。世界局势正因为美国破坏谈判和扩大战争的步骤而更加紧张。不论哈利逊如何申辩无罪，世界人民将不会饶恕他所代表的一小撮美国战争贩子和军火商人的滔天罪行的。
