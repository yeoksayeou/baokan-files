    Publicize the Achievements of the Motherland's Construction in the Past Three Years
    Editor: The third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. In the past three years, our country has made tremendous achievements in military, political, economic, and cultural construction. Vigorously publicizing these achievements, I believe, is the current task of all propagandists. Therefore, I suggest that local Party committees earnestly educate propagandists to publicize the achievements of the past three years in a planned manner. To this end, local Party committees should provide propagandists with learning materials and organize them to study and discuss these materials.

    宣传三年来的祖国建设成就
    编辑同志：中华人民共和国建国三周年纪念日快要到来了。三年来，我们国家在军事、政治、经济、文化等方面的建设都有极大的成就，大力宣传这些成就，我认为是全体宣传员的当前任务。因此，我建议各地党委要认真教育宣传员有计划地宣传三年来的成就。为此，各地党委应供给宣传员以学习材料，并组织他们学习讨论这些材料。
