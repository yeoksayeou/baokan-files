Xinhua News Agency Reporter Comments on the Incident of U.S. Aircraft Dropping Small Field Mice Carrying Plague Bacilli in Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province

    At approximately 10:00 PM on April 4, 1952, a U.S. F-82 twin-fuselage night fighter crossed the Yalu River and intruded into the airspace of the Tenth District of Gannan County at around 11:30 PM, before returning along its original route. These facts have been confirmed by the air defense authorities of Gannan County. When the enemy aircraft intruded into the airspace over Gannan, Chen Wanfu of the Fourth Neighborhood, Minzhong Village, Tenth District of Gannan, who had gotten up in the middle of the night to feed his horse, and the aunt of Liu Yunfa of the same village, who had gotten up in the middle of the night to feed her child, both heard the sound of the aircraft. Others who heard the sound of the aircraft included Tang Wanyou's mother of the Fifth Neighborhood, Xinmin Village, Liu Fu, a villager, Wang You of the Third Neighborhood, Minzhong Village, and Ma Shuying, the wife of Guo Yufang of the Third Neighborhood, Gongnong Village.

    On the morning of April 5th, in 31 of the 45 villages of the four administrative villages of Minzhong, Gongnong, Xinmin, and Gongyi in the Tenth District of Gannan County, many dead or dying small field mice were found. A total of 717 were found, in locations including the wilderness, puddles, indoors, on rooftops, in front of and behind houses, in vegetable cellars, and in wells.

    Bacteriological tests on these small field mice revealed that they carried plague bacilli.

    Animal identification indicated that these small field mice were closest to M. (Stenocranius) Gregalis (Pallas), one of the six species of small field mice in Northeast China. M. Gregalis is produced in Mongolia, North China and West Manchuria, so it may be possible in Gannan, but the small field mice found in Gannan this time are different from this species. The identification of plague expert Ji Shuli and rodentologist Xia Wuping proves that the main differences are as follows: 1. The tail is obviously shorter: the tail of M. Gregalis is about one and a half times the length of the metatarsal and one-quarter of the length of the head and torso, but the tail of the newly discovered small mouse in Gannan is almost the same length as the metatarsal. 2. The distance between the eyes is wider. 3. The fur color is darker. 4. It has an extra callus.

    In August of this year, the Japanese "Koan News" reported: There is an "organization" in the county, headed by a county council member and Ogawa (transliteration), a subordinate of the war criminal Lieutenant General Ishii. This "organization" is very similar to the farm formerly run by the Japanese bacterial unit in Northeast China that specialized in cultivating marmots and mice, supplying 150,000 marmots every month, presumably for experiments related to bacteriological warfare. From here, it is not difficult for people to associate the notorious "Unit 731" led by bacteriological warfare criminal Shiro Ishii, and the fact that they forced local people to "donate" large numbers of live rats in Northeast China. As is well known, Japanese and American bacteriological warfare experts had already begun cooperating by the end of 1946. War criminal Shiro Ishii told the U.S. military authorities about his "discoveries." When people connect these issues, they will discover new problems.

    While the reporter was studying the origin of the small field mice in Gannan, I happened to meet Dr. Hu Zhengxiang, who told me with great pain about a very cunning and treacherous fact about an American "businessman." He said: On November 2, 1948, I suddenly received a letter from Schwentker, who called himself an "animal dealer" in Newark, New York State, USA (Before this, Van Deusen, an American pastor who claimed to have lived in Weixian and Qingdao, China for 30 years, also sent me a letter talking about this matter). He said that for scientific research, he asked me to find him ten pairs of field mice (Cricetulus Griseus). He introduced the scale of his laboratory, saying that during the Second World War, he could send out 35,000 white mice every week for research. The experimental mice for the Rockefeller Foundation Laboratory, the American oil king, were also supplied by him. Later, he asked relationships in Shanghai and Nanjing to write letters to me. Until December 2, 1948, through Fu Meiling (the daughter of American spy Fuchaisheng, a major American spy), an American spy in the Xiehe Hospital at the time, American spy Bao Ruide transported ten pairs of field mice to Nanjing by American military plane, and then transferred them to New York via Shanghai. For ten pairs of field mice, he and the people he entrusted wrote me eight long letters and sent a telegram. He wrote back in May 1950 that the mice had reproduced more than 100. ... Speaking of this, Dr. Hu was extremely excited. He said: It was not until I participated in the work of anti-bacteriological warfare this time that I realized why the American "animal merchant" was so enthusiastic about cultivating the "new species" of field mice! Because of my purely technical position at the time, I fell for such a big trick by the imperialist elements, which caused incalculable harm to the interests of the people. Thinking about it now makes me feel extremely painful!

    After reading the above reports and listening to this shocking and tortuous narrative, the problems I wanted to study were basically solved. The small field mice in Gannan are very likely a new variant cultivated by the American aggressors from the field mice they collected and defrauded from our country.

    Bai Xiqing, Deputy Minister of the Department of Health of the Northeast People's Government, when reporting to the members of the International Scientific Committee on the U.S. aircraft airdropping small field mice carrying plague bacilli in Gannan County, definitely pointed out, based on the following evidence: The small field mice found in the Tenth District of Gannan were dropped by U.S. aircraft.

    1.  From the perspective of the discovery situation, the masses in the Tenth District checked around the villages and inside and outside the houses for insects on April 4, and did not see any small field mice, but after the U.S. aircraft flew over at midnight on the 4th, 717 small field mice were suddenly discovered in the four administrative villages, and most of them were dead or injured. This sudden appearance is abnormal.

    2.  From the perspective of the location of discovery, animals of the subfamily Murinae are wild and do not live in villages and settlements. As Sowerby said: "They live in the wild, uncultivated land, with different species living in different places, such as forests, bushes, grasslands, hillsides, pastures, and reed beds." This sudden appearance in the village is abnormal.

    3.  From the perspective of the season of discovery, the small field mice in Gannan appeared on April 5. At this time, the ice and snow in Heilongjiang Province had just melted. According to records, the average temperature in the area in early April was 6.4 degrees Celsius. At this season, the activity and reproduction of rodents had just begun. The sudden appearance in large numbers is also abnormal.

    4.  From the perspective of the number of discoveries, although there are six species of small field mice in Northeast China, their numbers are not large. For example, in a survey conducted in Tongliao, Kailu, and Dongkezhong Banner in 1949, only 32 of the genus Microtus were found among the 12,717 various rodents captured. This also shows that it is impossible for a large number of small field mice to suddenly appear in Northeast China.

    Many experts definitively pointed out, based on the following arguments, that the U.S. aircraft dropped small field mice to spread the plague.

    1.  Plague bacilli were isolated from the body of a small field mouse. After various tests and detailed identification with other bacteria of the genus Pasteurella, it was determined that it was undoubtedly plague bacilli.

    2.  The bacilli carried by this small field mouse were not naturally infected. The main rodents that transmit plague in Northeast China are three types: large rats, yellow rats, and house mice. No small field mice have ever been found to be infected with plague. Historically, there has been no plague in the Gannan area. During the two outbreaks of pneumonic plague in Northeast China from 1910 to 1911 and from 1920 to 1921, Gannan was not affected. After 1928, no plague occurred or spread in the entire northern part of Northeast China. In such a long period, it would be impossible for humans not to be infected if rats had plague for a long time. It can be seen that the discovery of small field mice carrying plague bacilli in the Gannan area this time is by no means a natural infection.

    3.  Could these small field mice have migrated from nearby plague-contaminated areas? The answer is: impossible. First, the areas in Northeast China where plague has occurred in humans and rats in recent years are at least 300 kilometers away from the Tenth District of Gannan County, such as Anguang, Zhendong, Baicheng, and Ulanhot. Second, Tailai County, the only area where human and rat plague has occurred, is more than 150 kilometers away from the Tenth District of Gannan, but no bacteria-carrying rats have ever been found. Therefore, it is impossible for the plague to migrate from nearby areas on its own. Moreover, the land transportation between the two places requires crossing the Nenjiang River twice in the east and crossing six rivers in the west. It can be seen that it is impossible for the small field mice to migrate on their own.

    4.  In the western part of Northeast China, the plague season for rodents lasts from the end of April or early May to September and October, and the plague season for humans lasts from the end of May or early June to the end of October. This time, small field mice carrying plague bacilli were discovered in Gannan County on April 5, and the area is in the northern part, which is completely inconsistent with the plague season in Northeast China.

    Finally, I would like to use the opinion of the International Scientific Committee on the Gannan incident as the conclusion of this article. The opinion of the International Scientific Committee is: "There is no doubt that this large number of small field mice suffering from plague were dropped in the Gannan area by the aircraft that the villagers heard on the night of April 4-5, 1952. This aircraft was a U.S. F-82 twin-fuselage night fighter." (Xinhua News Agency)

    新华社记者评述美机在黑龙江省甘南县投掷带有鼠疫杆菌的小田鼠事件经过
    一九五二年四月四日下午十时许，美国F—82型双机身夜间战斗机一架，越境飞过鸭绿江，约于十一时三十分侵入甘南县第十区上空，随后又循原航线飞回。这些情况，均经甘南县防空机关证实。当敌机侵入甘南上空时，半夜起来喂马的甘南十区民众村四闾陈万福和同村半夜起来给小孩喂奶的刘云发的婶母都听到飞机声音。同时听到飞机声音的还有该区新民村五闾唐万有的母亲、村民刘富、民众村三闾的王有、工农村三闾郭玉芳的妻子马淑英等人。
    四月五日晨，甘南县第十区民众、工农、新民、公议四个行政村的四十五个屯的三十一个屯中，发现许多已死或将死的小田鼠，先后共找到七一七只，发现的场所在野外、水坑、室内、房顶、房前房后、菜窖和水井等地。
    这种小田鼠，经细菌学检验，发现带有鼠疫杆菌。
    动物鉴定表明，这种小田鼠仅与东北六种小田鼠中的M·（Stenocranius）Gregalis（Pallas）最为接近。M·Gregalis产于蒙古、华北、西满，所以在甘南是可能有的，但此次在甘南所发现的小田鼠与该种是有所不同的。鼠疫专家纪树立、啮齿动物学家夏武平的鉴定证明，主要有下述区别：一、尾显然较短：M·Gregalis之尾约为蹠长之一倍半，为头躯长的四分之一，但甘南新发现的小鼠尾几与蹠长相同。二、眼间距较宽。三、毛色较深。四、多一胼胝。
    今年八月份日本“兴亚新闻”报道：该县设有
    一个“机关”，由县议会议员及战犯石井中将以前的下属小川（译音）主持。这个“机关”很像日本细菌部队以前在中国东北所办的专门培养土拨鼠与老鼠的农场，每月供给十五万只土拨鼠，大概是用来进行与细菌战有关的实验的。从这里，人们就不难联想到臭名昭著的细菌战犯石井四郎所领导的
    “七三一部队”，为什么在我国东北要强迫当地人民大量“献纳”活鼠的事实。如所周知，日美两国的细菌战专家，早在一九四六年底就已经实行合作了，战犯石井四郎曾把他的“发现”告诉美军当局，人们把这些问题联系起来看，就会发现新的问题。
    在记者正研究甘南小田鼠的来源时，恰巧遇到胡正详博士，他非常痛心地告诉我一件美国“商人”十分狡诈奸险的事实。他说：一九四八年十一月二日，我突然收到美国纽约州纽渥克城自称为“动物商人”的许温脱柯（Schwentker）的一封信（在此以前，一个自称在我国潍县、青岛住过三十年的美国牧师范特生（Van Deusen）也给我一信谈到此事），他说为了科学的研究，要求我代他找十对田鼠（Cricetulus Griseus），他介绍他实验室的规模说，在第二次世界大战时，每周可送出三万五千只小白鼠供研究用，美国煤油大王洛克菲勒基金实验室的实验鼠也由他供给。以后他又找上海、南京的关系给我写信，直到一九四八年十二月二日，由当时协和医院的美籍特务福美龄（美国大特务福开森的女儿）介绍美国特务包瑞德由美国军用机把十对田鼠运到南京，再经上海辗转运到纽约。为了十对田鼠，他和他托的人给我写了八封长信，打了一个电报。他在一九五○年五月份回信说，该鼠已经繁殖了一百多只。……谈到这里，胡博士至为激动，他说：直到这次我参加反细菌战的工作，我才明白美国“动物商人”为什么那样热心要培养田鼠的“新种”了！我由于当时的纯技术立场，以致上了帝国主义分子这样的大当，对人民利益有了不可计算的危害，如今想起，真使我万分痛心！
    在看了上述报道和听了这个惊人而曲折的叙述后，我所要研究的问题也基本解决了。甘南小田鼠，很可能就是美国侵略者从我国搜罗和骗取去的田鼠所培养出的一个新的变种。
    东北人民政府卫生部白希清副部长在向国际科学委员会委员们报告美国飞机在甘南县空投带有鼠疫杆菌的小田鼠时，依据下列证据，肯定地指出：甘南十区所发现的小田鼠是美机投下的。
    一、从发现的情况来说，四月四日十区群众曾在各村周围及住宅内外检查昆虫，并没有看到小田鼠，但于四日午夜美机飞过后，次晨突然在四个行政村中发现小田鼠七一七只，而且多是死的、伤的，这种突然出现是反常的。
    二、从发现场所来说，小田鼠亚科的动物是野生的，不居住在村屯以内。如索维伯（Sowerby）氏说：“它们居住在野外非耕耘的地中，不同之种类居住在不同的地方，如森林、树丛、草地、山坡、牧场及芦苇丛中。”此次突然在村内出现是反常的。
    三、从发现的季节上来说，甘南的小田鼠出现在四月五日，这时黑龙江省冰雪刚融，据纪录四月上旬当地的平均温度是摄氏六点四度，在这个季节鼠类的活动及繁殖不过刚刚开始，突然大量出现，也是反常的。
    四、从发现的数量来说，东北的小田鼠种类虽有六种，但其数量并不多，如一九四九年在通辽、开鲁、东科中旗三地调查，在一万二千七百一十七只捕得的各种啮齿动物中，只有小田鼠属三十二只，这一点也可以说明在东北小田鼠不可能大量突然出现。
    许多专家依据下列论据，肯定地指出美机投下小田鼠，是用以传播鼠疫的。
    一、从一只小田鼠体内检查分离出鼠疫杆菌，经过各种试验，并曾与其他巴氏杆菌属的细菌作详细鉴别，确定是鼠疫杆菌无疑。
    二、这只小田鼠所带的杆菌，不是自然感染的。东北传播鼠疫的啮齿动物主要有三种：大家鼠、黄鼠、鼷鼠，从来还没有发现过小田鼠感染鼠疫。从历史上看，甘南地区也没有发生过鼠疫。东北在一九一○到一九一一年和一九二○到一九二一年两次肺鼠疫流行时，都没有波及甘南。一九二八年以后，整个东北的北部更没有鼠疫发生与流行。在这样长的时期内，假使鼠有鼠疫而人类长期不被感染，是不可能的。可见这次在甘南地区发现带鼠疫杆菌的小田鼠，绝不是自然感染的。
    三、这些小田鼠能否由附近鼠疫污染的地区迁来呢？答曰：不可能。第一、近年来东北发生过人和鼠的鼠疫地区，离甘南县第十区，最近的也有三百公里，如安广、镇东、白城、乌兰浩特等。第二、仅发生人鼠疫的地区泰来县，离甘南十区也在一百五十公里以上，但从没有发现带菌鼠。因此，鼠疫由附近地区自行迁来是不可能的。而且两地间陆路交通，在东面要渡过两次嫩江，在西面要渡过六条河流，可见小田鼠没有自行迁来的可能。
    四、东北地区西部鼠疫发生季节，鼠类鼠疫是由四月底或五月初到九、十月，人类鼠疫是由五月底或六月初到十月底。这次甘南县发现带有鼠疫杆菌的小田鼠是在四月五日，而地区又在北部，这与东北鼠疫发生季节完全不合。
    最后，我愿用国际科学委员会对甘南事件的意见做本文的结论，国际科学委员会的意见是：“毫无疑问的，这一大批患有鼠疫的小田鼠，是一九五二年四月四日至五日夜间村民所听到的飞机在甘南地区投下的。这架飞机系美国F—82型双机身夜航战斗机。”（新华社）
