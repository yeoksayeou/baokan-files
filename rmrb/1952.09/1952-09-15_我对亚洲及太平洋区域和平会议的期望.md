    My Expectations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    By Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress
    The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is the most significant event in Asia since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This conference will indeed be a major political milestone in the lives of the people of Asian countries. Through this conference, the people of Asian countries can declare to the world that their demand for complete independence is just. They can also question the conscience of the West on the issue of ending wars in Asia and replacing violence with the spirit of negotiation.
    Everyone knows that the world's current and former colonies have been exploited and have fallen into economic and cultural backwardness. These colonies have now become a major problem in human welfare. There is a need to overcome huge disasters such as disease, poverty, illiteracy and general economic backwardness. The primary conditions for curing these disasters are independence and peace. One of the great contributions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to world peace is that this conference will show fair-minded people all over the world that peace can be achieved in Asia. The problems involved in the transition from colonial status to independent status can be resolved justly and reasonably through negotiation. But both sides must have the willingness to deal with the problem fairly. The West must clearly realize that the days when they could maintain an unjust colonial system by military force are over. The East must continue to show, as it did recently at the Moscow Economic Conference, that the West has ample opportunities for mutually beneficial trade.
    Land Reform is Conducive to Peace. This peace conference will give observers around the world the opportunity to see that land reform is a fundamental measure to defend peace. The success of China's land reform can serve as an example and inspiration to farmers around the world, especially farmers in Asia, Africa and South America. In these regions, farmers make up the majority, and in many countries, they are becoming increasingly uneasy because the preparation for war impoverishes them and increases their suffering. However, only governments that demand and work for peace can achieve orderly and just land reform. Planning for war cannot carry out land reform, but only increases the difficulties of farmers. Planning for peace makes land reform possible. Therefore, in some respects, the willingness of a country's government to implement broad and thorough land reform at present is a test of their willingness to achieve peace.
    Japan - A Member of Asia
    I hope that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will send a letter of hope and encouragement to the Japanese people, calling on them to demand complete independence and reject rearmament and war, because this will not solve their problems in the slightest. Japan has a good industrial base and can play a glorious and welcome role in the ongoing revival and industrialization of Asia. Peace and construction can easily solve all of Japan's food problems. At present, the Japanese are suffering from semi-slavery under the "white-imposed clauses" of the San Francisco Treaty. No honest person can agree to allow the lawless American warlords, who are launching dangerous adventures in the Far East, to use the Japanese as cannon fodder. This peace conference will be able to welcome the Japanese people back into the friendship of equal Asian countries, into the friendship of "world peace", so that they have the determination and courage to resist the enslavement of the San Francisco Forced Treaty.
    The Moral Responsibility to Fight for Peace
    Today, there are many religious groups in the world, with hundreds of millions of believers and followers. Because the East was once the "birthplace of religion", I hope that this Eastern peace conference will issue an inspiring call to the conscience of all religious people, calling on them to work together for peace. All religions teach the basic morality of "all people are brothers and sisters", and now is the time to save mankind and avoid huge and catastrophic wars, and for this purpose, to unite all people, no matter how different their philosophies or economic systems may be, under such a simple plan, which is to replace force with negotiation, to replace planning for economic destruction with construction, and to implement various plans to improve the material, cultural and spiritual circumstances of all people around the world.
    A Call for Action is Necessary
    This conference will undoubtedly give full attention to the historical, economic and cultural realities that must be faced, but I hope that it will make it clear to everyone that action must be taken now. People who are in favor of peace must assume clear obligations on the issue of independence for all colonial and semi-colonial countries. There must be no foreign interference in the affairs of each country. The Korean War must be stopped, there must be a willingness to consult on all issues that are detrimental to peace, and there must be a clear commitment to negotiate without the use of force.
    I wish you every success in all your efforts! (Xinhua News Agency)

### 我对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的期望

    我对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的期望
    加拿大和平大会主席　文幼章
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开是自从中华人民共和国成立以来亚洲最重大的事件。这次会议的确将是亚洲各国人民生活中的一个重大的政治里程碑。通过这次会议，亚洲各国人民可以向世界声明他们要求完全独立是合乎正义的。他们也可以在结束亚洲的战争和以谈判精神代替暴力的问题上责问西方的良心。
    每个人都知道，世界上现在的殖民地和过去的殖民地都受到了剥削，在经济上与文化上陷于落后状态。这些殖民地现在成了人类福利中的一个重大问题。在那里需要克服疾病、贫穷、文盲和普遍的经济落后等等巨大的灾难。要医治这些灾难，首要条件就是独立与和平。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议对世界和平的伟大贡献之一是这次会议将向全世界心地公正的人们表明：在亚洲是可以实现和平的。从殖民地地位变为独立地位，其中所牵涉的问题没有不能公正合理地用谈判解决的。但是必须双方都有公正地处理问题的意愿。必须使西方认识清楚，他们用军事力量还能维持不义的殖民制度的日子，已经过去了。东方必须像不久前在莫斯科经济会议上所作的那样，继续表明西方有充分的机会进行互惠的贸易。土地改革是有利于和平的这次和平会议将使全世界的观察者有机会看到，土地改革是保卫和平的一个基本措施。中国土地改革的成功可以作为全世界农民的榜样和给他们以鼓舞，尤其是亚洲、非洲与南美洲的农民。在这些地区，农民占大多数，在许多国家里，因为要准备战争，使农民陷入贫困的境地，增加了他们的困苦，因此，他们是越来越不安了。但是，唯有要求和平并为和平而努力的政府才能够实现有秩序的、公正的土地改革。要策划战争就不能进行土地改革，而只是增加农民的困难。策划和平就使土地改革可以实现。因此，在某些方面来说，某一国家的政府愿不愿意在目前实现广泛而彻底的土地改革就是对它们愿不愿意实现和平的一个考验。
    日本——亚洲的一员
    我盼望亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议向日本人民发出一个给他们以希望与鼓舞的函电，号召他们要求完全独立并拒绝重新武装与战争，因为这丝毫不能解决他们的问题。日本有优良的工业基础，并且能够在亚洲正在进行的复兴与工业化的事业中起一种光荣的、受人欢迎的作用。和平与建设很容易就可以解决日本的一切粮食问题。目前，日本人正在旧金山条约“白种人所强加的条款”下遭受着半奴役的苦难。凡是正直的人，没有谁能够同意让正在远东发动危险的冒险的无法无天的美国军阀把日本人当作炮灰使用。这个和平会议将能够欢迎日本人人回到亚洲平等国家的友谊中来，回到“世界和平”的友谊中来，从而使他们有决心与勇气尽力抵抗旧金山强制条约的奴役。
    争取和平的道德上的责任
    今天世界上有许多宗教团体，有着亿万信徒和信从者。因为东方曾经是“宗教的发源地”，因此我希望这次东方的和平会议将对一切有宗教信仰的人们的良心发出一种振奋的号召，号召他们协力争取和平。一切宗教都教导“四海同亲”的基本道德，而现在正是挽救人类，避免巨大的、灾难惨重的战争的时候了，为此要把所有的人，不论他们的哲学或经济体制多么不同，都在这样一个简单的计划下团结起来，这个计划就是以谈判来代替武力，以筹划经济建设来代替破坏，推行种种计划去改进世界各地所有的人的物质、文化与精神的境遇。
    必须号召行动
    这次会议毫无疑问将对必须正视的历史、经济与文化的现实予以充分的重视，但我希望它应该使所有的人都十分清楚必须现在就采取行动。赞成和平的人们在一切殖民地和半殖民地国家独立的问题上必须承担明确的义务。对于各国本国的事情一定不要有外来的干涉。朝鲜战争必须制止，对于一切有害于和平的问题必须愿意会商，对于不用武力而进行谈判，必须要有明确的诺言。
    祝你们的一切努力都获得成功！    （新华社）
