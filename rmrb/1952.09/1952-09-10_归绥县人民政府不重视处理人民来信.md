    The GuiSui County People's Government Does Not Value Handling People's Letters

    To the Editor: From June 1951 up to now, the People's Inquiry Office of our GuiSui Municipal People's Government has forwarded 31 letters from the people to the GuiSui County People's Government for handling, of which only one has received a reply. Regarding these letters, our Inquiry Office has urged them to reply every half-month or ten days, some as many as four times, but without result. In January of this year, we also sent a letter from the GuiSui Municipal People's Government to the county, requesting a reply. On January 20th, the county replied, saying: "Most of the cadres in our county, except for a few who remained, have gone to the countryside to participate in land reform; the time limit for the letters forwarded by your city is too short (generally limited to five days, and extensions can be requested in advance), so we cannot reply in time." We felt that such a reply was not enough to solve the problem, and we submitted our opinions to the county for the second time, but we did not receive a reply for a long time. The third time, we sent cadres to make contact, and Wang Guanghua of the county's Inquiry Office replied: "Our cadres are all participating in the 'Three-Anti' Campaign, and no one is going to the countryside to understand the situation, so we cannot reply to your letters." We reported the above situation to the Inquiry Office of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government. Comrade Ma of the Provincial People's Government Inquiry Office contacted the county, but there was still no result. On May 24th, after reporting the detailed situation to the General Office of the Provincial People's Government, the Provincial People's Government sent Comrade Ma of the People's Inquiry Office to the county together with us to discuss ways to handle the people's letters, but it still did not attract the attention of the county's leading cadres. These 30 letters from the people have still not been answered.

    We demand that the county People's Government promptly clear the backlog of people's letters, guarantee that there will be no more backlogs in the future, and thoroughly correct the style of neglecting the handling of people's letters.

    归绥县人民政府不重视处理人民来信
    编辑同志：从一九五一年六月到现在为止，我们归绥市人民政府人民问事处先后转请归绥县人民政府处理的人民来信三十一件，其中仅一件有了答复。对这些信件，我们问事处曾经每隔半月或十天一次催促他们答复，有的催过四次之多，都没有结果。今年一月间，我们又曾经由归绥市人民政府去信请该县答复，一月二十日该县回信说：“我县干部除留少数外，大部分下乡参加土地改革去了；贵市转来信件，限期太短（一般的限五天，须延长的可以先声明），故不能及时答复。”我们觉得这样的答复不够解决问题，又第二次向该县提出我们的意见，很久也没有得到答复。第三次我们派干部前往接洽，该县问事处王光华答复说：“我们的干部全参加‘三反’了，没有人下乡了解情况，因此对你们的来信不能答复。”我们把以上情况反映给绥远省人民政府问事处。省人民政府问事处马同志和该县联系，仍然没有结果。五月二十四日，我们把有关详细情况汇报省人民政府办公厅后，省人民政府派人民问事处马同志会同我们前往该县协商处理人民来信办法，可是仍然没有引起该县领导干部的注意。这三十件人民来信，还是没有答复。
    我们要求该县人民政府从速清理所积压的人民来信，并保证今后不再积压，彻底纠正轻视处理人民来信的作风。　　　萨野
