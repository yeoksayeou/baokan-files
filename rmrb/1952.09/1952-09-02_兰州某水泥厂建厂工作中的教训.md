    Lessons from the Construction of a Cement Plant in Lanzhou
    Chen Yutian
    The construction of a cement plant in Lanzhou began in the summer of 1950 and has been going on for more than two years. During these two years, the department in charge of the construction has conducted resource surveys, factory design, site selection, equipment repair and dismantling (the plant uses old equipment), and preparation of some building materials. However, it has not yet officially started construction. Furthermore, the department is considering canceling the construction, or changing the construction scale and site, and re-doing the planning task book and preliminary design. Why? The fundamental reason is that the quantity and quality of resources have not been thoroughly clarified.
    The resource survey work began before 1950, but it was not conducted comprehensively and thoroughly. For example, regarding the investigation of limestone, they initially thought that a certain bay was good, then later thought that a certain gully was even better, and this year they discovered that a certain mountain and a certain town were better, and recently they discovered that a certain mountain was the best. Without thoroughly clarifying the quantity and quality of resources, the selection of the factory site and the design were based on partial materials, and the result was of course incorrect. The factory site selected by the plant is no longer suitable for the new resource situation; the original design scale is now considered too small to fully utilize the resources and meet the needs of future economic development in Northwest China. Especially after the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou railway, cement with a production capacity equivalent to that of the plant can be imported from other places, and the cost difference compared to that produced by the plant is not significant. Under such circumstances, how the plant should be constructed is worth reconsidering. If the plan and design are changed, a lot of work will have to be started from scratch. The funds and machines that are currently being tied up will not be put into production until who knows when. This kind of waste is difficult to calculate.

    兰州某水泥厂建厂工作中的教训
    陈雨田
    兰州某水泥厂的建设工作，从一九五○年夏天开始，到现在已经两年多了。两年多的时间内，负责建设的部门曾进行了资源调查、工厂的设计、厂址的选定、设备的修理和拆运（该厂系利用旧设备）、订购新的机器，以及部分建筑材料的准备等。但到现在还没有正式施工，并且该部门正在考虑取消这项建设，或者改变建设的规模和厂址，重新做计划任务书和初步设计。为什么呢？根本原因在于没有彻底搞清资源的数量和质量。
    资源调查工作，他们从一九五○年以前就开始了，但是，却没有全面地彻底地进行调查。如对于石灰石的调查，他们最初认为某某湾的好，后来认为某沟的还要好，今年又发现某山和某某镇的更好，最近又发现某某山的最好。没有彻底搞清资源的数量和质量，就根据局部的材料选择厂址和进行设计，其结果当然是不正确的。该厂所选择的厂址，目前已经不适合于资源的新情况；原来的设计规模，目前也觉得过小，不能充分地利用资源，也不能满足今后西北经济发展对水泥的需要。特别是天水到兰州的铁路通车以后，从外地可以输入和该厂产量相当的水泥，成本和该厂生产的相差也不大。在这样的情况下，该厂究竟应该如何建设，就值得重新考虑了。如果改变计划和设计，很多工作都得重头做起，目前还不能施工，被积压的资金和机器，不知何时才能投入生产。这种浪费是很难计算的。
