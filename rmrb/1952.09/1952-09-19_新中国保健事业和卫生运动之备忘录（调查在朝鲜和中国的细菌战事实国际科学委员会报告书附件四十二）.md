Memorandum on Health Care and Hygiene Movement in New China
(Appendix Forty-Two to the Report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacterial Warfare in Korea and China)

I

The committee made two immediate observations upon arriving in Beijing:

1.	The streets, parks, squares, and shops were extremely clean and tidy.
2.	There were almost no flies or mosquitoes.

Most of Beijing is still an old-style city with many small, old houses and courtyards. The courtyards that were seen were swept clean every day, and piles of garbage were never seen. Even the lumber or scrap iron in the stacks was piled neatly. Committee members who had lived in China six or seven years ago were amazed at these changes.

The committee found that the food sold is now always covered. Tea sold on the street is served in bowls with lids. In the parks, there are hot water tanks with lids. All spittoons are covered with appropriately sized wooden lids, with a wooden stick on the lid so that there is no need to bend over when opening it. Toilets are also covered in the same way. Furthermore, the previously very common habit of spitting has also been greatly reduced. Fly swatters can be found anywhere when flies are discovered, and children can be seen vigorously and effectively wielding fly swatters in every village. Everyone is, without exception, sensitive to flies.

II

The committee members met with Professor Yan Jingqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau and of the Department of Public Health at the Beijing University Medical College. He made the following remarks. Before 1949, the domestic hygiene standards were quite low. Liberation has brought about a complete change in the people's attitude towards hygiene, recognizing that hygiene is an important factor in improving work. Cadres everywhere are promoting this point. This is the background to the following achievements.

1.	Garbage - Beijing used to be a city full of garbage, with dirty streets. There was a street called "Erlong Road"; people called it "Erlong River" in the summer and "Erlong Mountain" in the winter because there was so much garbage. In 1949, all the old garbage (accumulated for forty years) was cleared away. Now the production and removal of garbage have reached a balance. 500,000 cubic meters were cleared in 1950, and 700,000 cubic meters in 1951; the increase in garbage is due to the improvement of living standards (and perhaps also due to population growth?). All garbage bins are now covered.

2.	Toilets - Before liberation, toilets were usually not covered, but now they all have lids (see above). Every day, people come with covered containers to empty them. Some houses still do not have toilets, and the people living there use public toilets, which are carefully kept clean. Many new public toilets have been built in every city. Both private and public toilets are sprinkled with lime. Even in Beijing today, only one percent of the residents can use flush toilets. The excrement is spread out quite far outside the city and is frequently turned over so that flies cannot breed on it. Mixed fertilizer is made from this excrement.

3.	Ditches - Beijing has had rainwater ditches since the Ming Dynasty (16th century), but they have not been repaired for a long time and cannot function as they should. After liberation, these ditches have been repaired, and new ditches have been built, for example, "Erlong Road" is now a road all year round. There was a ditch in Beijing where people could fall in, and indeed people had fallen in before. Now it has been converted into an underground drain. This is the famous "Dragon Beard Ditch," and someone has written a play about it. In some places outside the city, there are sewage pits, and the sludge inside has been treated.

4.	Tap water - Previously, only one-third of the residents had tap water, and the rest had to draw water from wells or pumping wells. Today, after liberation, all residents in the city have tap water.

5.	Flies and mosquitoes - As early as 1949, the need for a mosquito eradication campaign was felt, and this campaign has been going on since then. Closing all open ditches is an important measure of this campaign. Another equally important task is to block all tree holes: these holes are filled with mud and lime so that they do not become breeding grounds for mosquitoes after rain. These blocked tree holes can be seen everywhere.

Covering toilets and cleaning them daily seems to be the most important measure used to eradicate flies. Dr. Yan said, "If you take good care of the toilets, close the open ditches, and remove the garbage, there will be no flies."

6.	Dogs - Since the spring of 1952, Beijing has prohibited keeping dogs. The committee did not see a single dog in China during its first month. The reasons for banning dogs are:

(1)	Dogs may spread infectious diseases;
(2)	Dog excrement left outside attracts flies;
(3)	Dogs may be reservoir hosts for encephalitis viruses;
(4)	Dogs can cause traffic difficulties.

7.	Hygiene Movement - This movement is probably the most important measure in the war against mosquitoes and flies. The extraordinary results of China in this area and in general public health can only be explained by the wholehearted cooperation of the masses and every individual. In this way, incredible results can be obtained with very simple methods. The slogans of the hygiene movement are: "Everyone needs health" and "The people have a responsibility to protect their own health."

The fly and mosquito eradication hygiene movement starts every year in March and lasts until autumn. Sometimes large meetings are held where government officials give speeches, and then residents of each district in the city hold small group meetings. Competitions are also held. Hygiene officials conduct regular inspections. Various organizations (women, youth) ensure that all resolutions are implemented one hundred percent. Usually, one person is responsible for every ten households. There has been a great change in ideological understanding; in the past, it was against old customs for neighbors to criticize each other, but now constructive criticism and self-criticism are highly encouraged. Interest is growing every year. This year's results are better than any other year.

The hygiene movement is not only implemented by holding meetings but also by many different methods. There are many beautiful colored paintings posted, teaching people how to clean their houses or clothes, how to raise children, etc. Radio is also constantly giving instructions. Newspapers frequently publish articles on the importance of hygiene and hygiene measures. Interesting illustrated booklets are sold very cheaply. In dramas and concerts, there is often one or two famous actors, a man and a woman, singing together about the benefits of staying healthy and what a person should do; from the applause, it can be heard that this kind of performance is very popular.

8.	Hygiene statistics - The results of the above-mentioned measures have made infectious diseases far less rampant than before. If we take the number of people who died from typhoid fever in Beijing from April to June in 1950 as 100, the number for the same period in 1951 is 40. Dysentery inexplicably rose in 1951 (100-114), but the number for 1952 is 51. The numbers for other intestinal infectious diseases (summer diarrhea, intestinal parasites, etc.) were 74 in 1951 and 35 in 1952.

Here, it must also be mentioned that during the Kuomintang period, less than 7.3 million people were vaccinated against smallpox each year (the highest record in 1946). Since liberation, by the end of 1951, the number of people vaccinated has exceeded more than half of the population (307 million people). This number further increased to more than 369.36 million people (369,360,893) by the end of June 1952. The epidemic of smallpox has almost disappeared. China has not had any cholera cases since 1949. The training of midwives has reduced the mortality rate of newborns (neonatal tetanus); the mortality rate in Beijing is

	1949	0.72%
	1950	0.57%
	1951	0.25%

The maternal mortality rate has also almost halved:

	1950	0.24%
	1951	0.13%

In order to reduce the possibility of plague epidemics, a regular rat extermination campaign has been launched in Northeast China; 35 million rats were exterminated in 1951.

9.	Vaccine production - The committee visited the Central Biological Products Institute under the direction of Dr. Tang Feifan.

The Central Biological Products Institute is responsible to the Ministry of Health. It was established in 1946-47, but it has now been greatly expanded. It has seven branches distributed in various cities in China, and this is the head office. It has 700-800 staff members, with technicians accounting for about 500. The Biological Products Institute has its own animal farm outside Xicheng in Beijing and its own glass factory. The scientific standards are the highest. The main work of the Biological Products Institute is to manufacture and inspect vaccines. The output of smallpox vaccine is naturally very large; in addition to the ordinary smallpox vaccine, they also manufacture a dry smallpox vaccine sealed in ampoules.

Other vaccines manufactured in large quantities include typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, pertussis, and typhus (chicken embryo method).

BCG vaccine is manufactured separately in a building; tetanus and gas gangrene are also manufactured in the same way.

Encephalitis vaccine (against Chinese summer-autumn encephalitis) is made from the brains of white mice.

All vaccines must finally be inspected by the Central Biological Products Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Health, so the management is very strict.

The Central Biological Products Institute also manufactures a large number of serums and also manufactures penicillin and streptomycin, but so far, it is still on a small scale.

10.	Manufacturing of insecticides - Although the insect extermination movement does not mainly rely on chemical methods, the manufacturing of DDT and other insecticides has made great strides in new China. This has proven its usefulness and importance in the anti-bacterial warfare and in meeting the needs of the Chinese People's Volunteers.

III

The committee then had the opportunity to see how hygiene work was being carried out in Northeast China and how it was fighting the crisis of bacterial warfare.

These were already encountered at the Beijing Railway Station. Anyone who buys a ticket to any place north of Shanhaiguan must show his vaccination certificate (with photo attached) before entering the carriage. Shanhaiguan is where the train passes through the Great Wall.

The carriages themselves are also very clean, and posters promoting how to improve health and fight the threat of bacterial warfare can be seen everywhere on the train (they are colorful and very eye-catching).

On the train, tea is served in covered glass cups. At some stations, there are rows of women selling food, wearing white clothes and masks. The food sold is placed in covered containers and taken with tweezers when supplied (steamed buns, roast chicken, sausage, etc.). They are all private vendors under the management of the railway authorities.

When returning to Beijing from Shenyang, at the Shanhaiguan border station, the committee had to get off the train for a while when the carriages were being disinfected. Since the occurrence of bacterial warfare, a new method of vehicle disinfection has been invented and is now being implemented. This includes a short tunnel with many pipes on its four walls. Steam at 200 degrees Celsius is sprayed through these pipes to disinfect the carriages, but chemical agents are used for goods that may be damaged by steam. Passenger cars are disinfected by spraying chemical agents with ordinary manual containers.

IV

In Shenyang, the committee noted the same things as in Beijing: cleanliness, no garbage, no mosquitoes, and almost no flies.

Bai Xiqing, Deputy Minister of the Health Department of the Northeast Administrative Region, reported to the committee on the measures adopted against bacterial warfare. He said that they were convinced that bacterial warfare had been carried out in Northeast China since February 1952. Therefore, a widespread publicity and education campaign was immediately launched. All the people were organized and knew how to deal with it. They were given explanations on personal hygiene and how to keep their residences clean. They all knew that anything that fell from airplanes or the sky must be destroyed immediately and that they could not touch it with their hands. They knew that all rat holes had to be blocked. If an attack was confirmed or suspected, disinfection was carried out immediately (for detailed orders on this, please refer to Annex Thirteen). Since the beginning of suspicion of bacterial warfare, residents have been educated to eliminate all insects (flies, mosquitoes, fleas, etc.). The work of searching for insects is constantly being carried out, and the frequency can be determined according to the situation of the bacterial war. Students and young people are making special efforts.

In Shenyang, the committee visited a tofu mill. It has a modern and hygienic lid. This kind of lidless mill has been used in China for at least a thousand years. It consists of two porous millstones, the upper hole is used to load soybeans, and the soy milk flows out from the lower hole. Water is gradually added to make the mill easier to push. There is a device attached to the top of the mill that can be driven by a donkey. In the past, dust, donkey droppings, hair, and its accompanying bacteria contaminated the soy milk, making it often impossible to manufacture in hot weather. Now a very perfect wooden lid has been invented and is being applied everywhere. There is also a mirror on it so that people can see from it whether the container for filling soy milk is about to be full.

In Shenyang, some committee members visited several ordinary workers' residences. Every morning at five o'clock, a full cleaning is started, and only after the cleaning is completed are the vegetables and fruits of the day bought home. In a corner of a courtyard, there is a tall and narrow, seemingly old pottery jar with a wooden lid. We were told that this is the utensil used to disinfect vegetables and fruits. It is treated with calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder) solution for five minutes. Afterwards, the fruits are washed again in boiling water, and the vegetables are cooked. Vegetables are rarely eaten raw in China, but the cooking time is often very short.

Overall, the completion of all health care work has not changed their old-fashioned and often very simple living conditions. This is a characteristic of China, giving people the deepest impression. They do not have time to wait for the construction of houses with modern equipment. Therefore, they carry out health education work under the existing conditions. Experience has proven that this can completely solve the problem, at least in today's China.

V

When the committee was sitting on a truck traveling one hundred and fifty kilometers from Laha to Gannan Road in the northernmost part of Heilongjiang Province bordering Inner Mongolia, everywhere they could not help but admire its cleanliness and order. Lime-coated wooden garbage bins with lids are placed in front of every house in the village. There are very clean and simple earthen latrines, also well covered, and the ditches are well maintained; no rat holes can be seen either. At the crossroads of many villages, you can see the very popular blackboard newspapers, with chalk writing rules, warnings and news, and often clever drawings about harmful insects and bacteria. This kind of bulletin is very economical, has local color, and is also easy to change.

The committee understood some concrete examples proving that the people of Northeast China completely know how to deal with bacterial warfare when they encounter it. It is impossible to cause panic among them. The committee is firmly convinced of this, the reason being the experience in the remote Gannan County, and the behavior and words of the witnesses in front of them. The committee members had talked with the people of Liaodong Province near the Korean border, and also with many adults and children near Shenyang. When he listened to these people talk, he began to see some things he had never known before—a terrible, bizarre, and moving epic unfolded naturally before his eyes. He saw hundreds or even thousands of people wearing self-made masks and gloves, holding tweezers made of corn stalks like chopsticks, slowly moving day after day in their own villages, bending over to collect small insects and feathers one by one, knowing that death was near at hand as they worked patiently. Some people were afraid—they said so—but no one complained.

In their enthusiasm to fulfill their responsibilities, enthusiastically implementing the government's rational instructions, destroying everything that was thrown down, collecting insects, feathers, and rodents, and searching for containers, they were able to forget their fear. In other words, they were, are now, and still are willingly and resolutely serving the people.

VI

After examining the hygiene measures and hygiene education in Beijing and Northeast China, the International Scientific Committee unreservedly agreed with the following opinions:

1.	Today, a great movement is underway in China to promote personal and social hygiene. This movement is supported wholeheartedly by 500 million people. A hygiene movement of this scale has never been seen in human history.
2.	This movement has taken effect, greatly reducing the mortality rate and morbidity rate caused by infectious diseases.
3.	In our opinion, trying to eliminate such a nation with bacterial warfare is not only criminal, but also futile. (Xinhua News Agency)

    新中国保健事业和卫生运动之备忘录
    （调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书附件四十二）
    一
    委员会到北京立即做了两个观察：
    1、街道、公园、广场和商店极为清洁整齐。
    2、几乎完全没有蝇子和蚊子。
    北京大部分仍是一个旧式的城市，有很多狭小、古老的房子和院子。所见到的院子都是每天扫的干干净净，并且从来没有看见垃圾堆着。就是在堆栈里木料或碎铁也是堆的很整洁。六七年前曾在中国住过的委员会委员看见这些改变不禁惊讶。
    委员会发现售卖的食品，现在总是盖着的。街上卖的茶都盛在带盖的碗里。在公园里有盖着的热水缸。所有的痰盂都盖着大小合适的木头盖，盖上有一根木棍，掀盖时无需弯腰。厕所也是用相同的方法盖着。还有从前极普遍的吐痰习惯现在也大为减少。发现蝇子时随时随地都能找到蝇拍，并且在每个乡村里都可以看到儿童们很有力而有效挥舞着蝇拍。每个人没有例外的对于蝇子都很敏感。
   二
    委员会的委员曾与北京市公共卫生局局长，北京大学医学院公共卫生学系严镜清教授会晤。他发表了以下的谈话。一九四九年以前国内的卫生水准颇低。解放使人民对卫生的态度有了完全的转变，认识卫生是提高工作的一个重要因素。干部们到处宣扬这一点。这就是下面各项成就的背景。
    1、垃圾——过去北京是一个充满了垃圾的城市，街道脏。有一条街叫“二龙路”；人们在夏天叫它“二龙河”，在冬天叫他“二龙山”，因为有很多垃圾。在一九四九年旧存的垃圾（堆集了四十年之久）都被清除了。现在垃圾的产生和清除已达平衡。一九五○年内清除了五十万立方公尺，一九五一年内七十万立方公尺；垃圾的增多是由于生活水准的提高（也许还由于人口的增加？）所有的垃圾桶现在都是盖着的。
    2、厕所——解放前厕所照例是不盖的，现在都有盖（见上文）。每天都有人带着有盖的容器把它们掏干净。有些房子还是没有厕所，里面住的人用公共厕所，这些公共厕所都是很小心的弄的很清洁。每个城市里都盖了许多新的公共厕所。私用的和公共厕所都洒石灰。就是北京今天也只有百分之一的居民能用抽水马桶。粪便在城外相当远的地方摊开，并且时常翻弄使蝇子不能在上面孳生。混合肥料就是用这些粪便做成的。
    3、沟渠——北京自从明朝（十六世纪）就有雨水沟，但是它们已有很久没有修理不能发挥应有的作用。解放后这些沟已修好，并且增建了新沟，例如“二龙路”现在一年到头都是一条路了。北京有一个地方有一条明沟。人可以掉下去，而且的确曾有人掉下去过。现在已修成阴沟。这就是有名的
    “龙须沟”，有人曾为它写了一个剧本。在城外某地有些污水坑，里面的淤污已经加以处理。
    4、自来水——以前只有三分之一的居民有自来水用，其余的人只好从井或抽水井里打水。在解放后的今天所有城内的居民都有自来水用。
    5、蝇子和蚊子——远在一九四九年就已感到需要一个灭蚊运动，自从那时起这个运动一直在进行。封闭所有的明沟是这个运动的一个重要措施。另一项同样重要的工作是堵塞所有的树洞：这些洞是用泥和石灰填塞，这样在下雨后它们不致成为蚊子孳生的地方。到处都可以看见这些堵起来的树洞。
    厕所加盖和每天清除厕所，好像是灭蝇所用的最要紧的措施。严博士说：“如果你好好照管厕所，封闭明沟，清除垃圾，就不会有蝇子。”
    6、狗——从一九五二年春起北京不准养狗。委员会在中国的第一个月里一条狗也没见过。禁止养狗的理由是：
        （1）狗可能传布传染病；
        （2）狗的排泄物露在外面会吸引蝇子；
        （3）狗可能是脑炎病毒的储藏宿主；
        （4）狗会造成交通上的困难。
    7、卫生运动——这个运动大概是对蚊蝇作战最重要的措施。中国在这方面以及一般的公共卫生方面的不平凡的结果只能用群众和每一个人的全心合作来解释。像这样就能用很简单的方法得到不可置信的结果。卫生运动的标语是：“每个人都需要健康”和“人民有责任保护自己的健康”。
    灭蝇灭蚊的卫生运动每年从三月起始一直到秋天。有时开大会由政府官员讲演，然后城内各区居民再开小组会。还展开竞赛。卫生负责人经常检查。各种组织（妇女、青年）保证所有的决议都要百分之百的执行。普通每十家有一个人负责。思想认识已有了很大的改变；以前邻居彼此批评是不合乎老风俗的，但是现在带有建设性的批评和自我批评很受鼓励。兴趣年年在增长。今年的结果比任何一年都好。
    卫生运动不单是用开会的办法来执行，而是用许多不同的方法。有很多好看的彩色画贴着，教给人如何把房子或衣服弄干净，如何抚养儿童等等。无线电也不断的给予指示。报纸经常的刊载有关卫生和卫生措施的重要性的文章。有趣的附有插图的小册子卖的很便宜。在戏剧和音乐会上时常有一个或两个名角，一男一女、一起唱保持健康的好处和一个人应该做什么；从掌声中可以听出这种表演很受欢迎。
    8、卫生统计——上述的种种措施的结果使传染病已远不如从前猖獗。如果拿一九五零年四月到六月北京死于伤寒的人数做为一○○，一九五一年同一时期的数字是四○，痢疾在一九五一年不可解释的上升（一○○——一一四），但一九五二年的数字是五一。其他肠传染病（夏季腹泻，肠寄生虫等）的数字一九五一年为七四，一九五二年为三五。
    在这里还必须提到在国民党时期每年只有不到七百三十万人接种了牛痘（一九四六年最高纪录）。自解放以来到一九五一年底，接种人数已超过人口半数以上（三亿七百万人）。这个数目到一九五二年六月底又增加到三亿六千九百多万人（369，360，893）。牛痘的流行几乎已经绝迹。一九四九年以来中国未曾有过霍乱病例。收生婆的训练已使初生儿死亡率减少了（初生儿破伤风）；在北京的死亡率为
        1949年        0．72％
        1950年        0．57％
        1951年        0．25％
    产妇死亡率也几乎减少了一半：
        1950年        0．24％
        1951年        0．13％
    为了减少鼠疫流行的可能性，中国东北已经展开了经常的灭鼠运动；一九五一年内消灭了三千五百万只老鼠。
    9、疫苗生产——委员会参观了在汤飞凡博士主管下的中央生物制品研究所。
    中央生物制品研究所对卫生部负责。一九四六——四七年建立，但现在已大为扩展。它有七个分所分布在中国各城市，这个是总所。其中有工作人员七○○——八○○，技术人员约占五○○。生物制品所在北京西城外有自己的动物饲养场，并有自己的玻璃厂。科学标准是最高的。生物制品所的主要工作是制造和检定疫苗。牛痘苗的产量自然是很大；除了普通牛痘苗之外他们又制造一种干燥牛痘疫苗封在安瓶里。
    其他大量制造的疫苗有伤寒、副伤寒、霍乱、百日咳和斑疹伤寒（鸡胚制法）。
    卡介苗是单独在一个建筑里制造；破伤风和气性坏疽也是如此。
    脑炎疫苗（对抗中国夏秋型脑炎）是用白鼷鼠的脑子制造。
    所有的疫苗最后须经过卫生部中央生物制品检定所检定，所以管理是很严格的。
    中央生物制品研究所还大量制造血清，并且制造青霉素和链霉素，不过到现在为止还是小规模的。
    10、杀昆虫剂的制造——虽然灭昆虫的运动，主要的并不依赖化学方法，但是滴滴涕和其他杀昆虫剂的制造已在新中国突飞猛进。这在反细菌战和供应中国人民志愿军的需要方面证明了它的用处和重要性。
    三
    委员会随后有机会看到中国东北在怎样进行卫生工作和怎样面向细菌战的危机进行斗争。
    这些是在北京车站已经遇到过的。任何人如买票到山海关以北的任何地点，在进入车厢以前，他必须出示他的预防接种证明书（上附相片）。山海关就是火车穿过长城的地方。
    车厢本身也很洁净，宣传怎样增进健康及向细菌战威胁作斗争的宣传画在车上随时可见（着有颜色并很引人注意）。
    在车上，茶水是装在有盖的玻璃杯内。在有些车站上，有成排的妇女出售食物，她们穿着白衣，和戴着口罩。出售的食物，系放在有盖的器具内，供给时，用镊夹取（馒头，烧鸡，腊肠等）。他们都是在铁路当局管理下的私营小贩。
    从沈阳返回北京时，在山海关边境的站上，当车厢在进行消毒时，委员会必须由车上下来一些时候。自细菌战发生以来，发明了一种新的车辆消毒方法，现在已经实行。这是包括一个短的隧洞，在它的四壁上有许多管子，通过这些管子喷出摄氏二○○度的水蒸气，将车厢消毒，但如遇有可能被蒸气损害的货品时则用药剂消毒。客车则用普通的手动容器喷洒药剂消毒。
    四
    在沈阳，委员会注意到像在北京时一样的事情：洁净，没有垃圾，没有蚊子，几乎没有苍蝇。
    东北行政区卫生部副部长白希清医师把有关反细菌战所采用的措置，报导给委员会，他说他们确信自一九五二年二月以来细菌战就在中国东北进行着。因此即时展开了普遍的宣传教育工作。全体人民都组织起来了，并知道怎样去应付。给他们讲解了个人卫生及怎样保持他居处洁净。他们都知道任何从飞机上或天上落下来的东西，必须立即消灭，也知道不能用手去接触它。他们知道所有的鼠洞必须堵塞。如果确定或疑心曾有袭击则立即举行消毒
    （有关这点的详细命令，请参阅附件十三）。自从开始疑心有细菌战以来，即教育居民们消灭所有昆虫（苍蝇、蚊子及跳蚤等）。寻觅昆虫的工作经常在进行着，次数的多少可依着细菌战争的情况而决定，特别努力的是学生和青年。
    在沈阳，委员会参观了一个豆腐磨。它具有一个现代化合乎卫生的盖子。这种没有盖的磨在中国至少已应用了一千年。这是由两个有孔的磨石组成，上面的孔用以装注黄豆，而豆浆便由下面的孔流出来，逐渐的加水，使磨子的推动更容易。磨子上面附有一种装置，能用一只驴子来推动。在以往，灰尘、驴子的污物、毛发、及其附带的细菌污染了豆浆，以致在热天往往无法制造。而现在已经发明了一个很完美的木盖，并在各处都应用了。这上面还有一面镜子，可以使人从中看出装豆浆的容器，是否将要满了。
    在沈阳，有的委员会委员们拜访了几个普通工人住宅。每天清晨五时，即开始全部清扫，清扫后，才将当天的蔬菜果品买回家来。在一家院子的一个角落里，有一个高而窄，好像很旧的陶制的缸，上面有一个木盖。我们听说这就是用以消毒蔬菜和果品的器皿。用亚氯酸钙（漂白粉）溶液处理五分钟。以后果品再在开水中洗涤，而蔬菜则加以煮熟。在中国蔬菜很少是生吃的，但煮的时间常是极短的。
    总起来说，所有的保健工作的完成并没有改变他们那些旧式的，而且时常是很简单的生活情形。这是中国的特点，给与人们最深刻的印象。他们没有时间等待具有现代化设备的房屋的建造。因此他们就在现有的条件下进行卫生宣教工作。经验证明这样作是完全能解决问题的、至少在今日的中国是如此的。
    五
    当委员会坐在卡车上在黑龙江省的最北部与内蒙古邻界的拉哈到甘南道上旅行了一百五十公里的时候，在每一个地方都不由得不惊佩它的清洁和秩序。涂有石灰的带盖的木垃圾箱放在村子的每家门前。那里有很干净的简单的土茅厕，也盖的很好，水沟保持得很好；也看不见鼠洞。在许多村子的十字路口上可以看到极受欢迎的黑板报，上面用粉笔写条规，警告和新闻，并常有关于有害的昆虫和细菌的巧妙的图画。这种布告是很经济的，有地方的色彩，也很容易改换。
    委员会了解了一些具体的事例，证明中国东北的人民当遇到细菌战的时候完全知道怎样去应付。想引起他们的惊惶是不可能的。委员会对此深信无疑，其原因是由于有了在遥远的甘南县的经验，和摆在他们面前的见证人们的举止和言谈。委员们曾和接近朝鲜边境的辽东省人民谈过话，也和沈阳附近的许多成年男女和儿童们谈过话。当他倾听这些人谈话的时候，他开始看见了以前从来没有知道过的一些事情——一首可怕的，离奇的，而又动人的史诗在他的眼前自然的展开了。他看到了成百甚至成千的人们戴着自制的口罩和手套，手里拿着玉米秸做的像筷子似的镊子，一天一天的在他们自己的乡村里慢慢地移动着，弯着腰收集一个一个的小昆虫和羽毛，当他们耐心地工作的时候，他们知道死亡就近在手边。也有些人觉得害怕——他们这么说——但是没有人抱怨。
    在他们热情的尽到他们职责的时候，热情地执行政府的合理的指示，消灭投掷下来的一切物件，收集昆虫，羽毛和啮齿动物，以及寻找容器的时候，他们能够忘记了恐惧。换句话说，他们过去是，现在还是甘心地并且决心地为人民服务。
    六
    国际科学委员会在考查了北京市和中国东北的卫生措施和卫生教育之后，毫无保留地赞同了以下的意见：
    一、今天在中国正在进行着一个伟大的运动，在促进个人和社会的卫生。这个运动是受五万万人民全心全意的支持的，这样规模的卫生运动是人类有史以来从未有过的。
    二、这个运动已经发生了作用，使得由于传染疾病而引起的死亡率和发病率大为减低了。
    三、在我们看来，试想用细菌战消灭这样一个民族不仅是犯罪的，而且也是徒然的。（新华社）
