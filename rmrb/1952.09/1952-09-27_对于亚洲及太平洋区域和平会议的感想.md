    Thoughts on the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Professor Kazuto Matsuura, Hokkaido University
    I completely agree with the agenda of the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference." As a biologist, I firmly advocate against germ warfare. The fact that Japan and the United States have not yet ratified the Geneva Convention (prohibiting germ warfare) has been condemned worldwide, and it should be ratified quickly.

    From the standpoint of engaging in academic pursuits, I am very willing to promote academic exchanges with China and the Soviet Union. Although international exchanges can now be conducted with the United States, this is only one-sided, which makes the academic community in Japan very unhealthy. In order to advance Japanese academia, I sincerely hope to realize it.

    As for whether I personally support capitalism or socialism, I think there is no need to explain. From my standpoint, I firmly believe that capitalism and socialism, and various different systems of new democracy can coexist on the earth.

    My hope for all the Japanese representatives is: first of all, they should apologize to China for the brutal and inhumane things Japan has done to China in the past. This is a matter that should be brought up first from the standpoint of Japan.

    对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的感想
    北海道大学教授　松浦一
    对于“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”的议题，完全赞成。作为一个生物学家，我坚决主张反对细菌战。日本和美国还没有批准日内瓦公约（禁止细菌战）一事，受到全世界的谴责，这是应该很快地予以批准的。
    站在从事学问的立场，很愿意与中国、苏联促进学术上的交流。虽然现在与美国可以进行国际交流，但是，这只是片面的，因而使日本的学术界很不健全，为了推进日本的学术，衷心地希望实现它。
    至于我本人是拥护资本主义，还是拥护社会主义，我想毋须加以说明。从我的立场来说，我坚决相信资本主义和社会主义、新民主主义的各种不同的制度在地球上是可以共存的。
    我对日本全体代表所抱的希望是：首先应该就过去日本对中国所做的残暴而不人道的事，向中国道歉，这是站在日本的立场上应该首先提出来的问题。
