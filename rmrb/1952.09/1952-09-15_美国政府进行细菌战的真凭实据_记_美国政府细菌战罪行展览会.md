Conclusive Evidence of the US Government's Germ Warfare
——A Record of the "Exhibition of Crimes of Germ Warfare by the US Government"
By Our Correspondent Ke Hui

The towering crime of the American aggressors, who disregarded international conventions and conducted inhumane germ warfare against Korea and China, is supported by ironclad evidence, arousing unparalleled anger and unanimous condemnation from the people of Korea and China and the people of the world. Although the US government is still trying to deny its responsibility in every possible way, the lies written in ink cannot cover up the facts written in blood. The Exhibition of Crimes of Germ Warfare by the US Government, recently held in Beijing, provided much irrefutable and bloody evidence.

(I)
The statements of many responsible US military and government officials and the materials revealed by the bourgeois press, which were displayed at the exhibition, fully prove that the germ warfare conducted by the American aggressors was a long-term and planned preparation. On January 4, 1946, Milton, former chairman of the US Army Biological Warfare Committee, revealed in a "Report on Germ Warfare to Army Minister Patterson" that the US government began setting up special institutions for researching and manufacturing germ weapons in 1941, and that research on germ warfare accelerated after 1943. In April of the same year, the US Department of the Army established a large-scale center for manufacturing germ weapons—the Detrick Camp—in Frederick, Maryland. Theodore Rosebury, a professor at Columbia University who participated in the manufacture of germ weapons at Detrick Camp, published a lengthy report on germ warfare in the May 1947 issue of the "Journal of Immunology," proving that the airborne and insect-borne dissemination of germs had "the greatest military application." In January 1948, Finletter (now the US Air Force Secretary), chairman of the US "President's Air Force Policy Committee," also advocated in a report to Truman that biological weapons should be given priority in military affairs. In 1949, Rosebury wrote a book entitled "Peace or Pestilence." This book further confirmed that Detrick Camp was the center for biological warfare research and revealed that this germ weapon factory had been continuously working after World War II. On March 12, 1949, just as the Kuomintang bandit gang was collapsing, former US Secretary of Defense Forrestal clamored for the use of germ weapons when necessary, saying that "germs or their toxic products can be effectively used as weapons of war." In April 1950, two months before the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the journal "Military Review," published by the US Army "Command and Staff School" in Kansas, shamelessly advocated and discussed how to conduct germ warfare. These facts fully prove that the American aggressors began preparing for germ warfare as early as ten years ago.

Many materials in the exhibition also prove that the US government's germ warfare was carried out in collusion with Japanese germ warfare criminals, former Japanese Army Surgeon General Shiro Ishii, Veterinary Major General Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano. A Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Rangoon on December 5, 1951, revealed that two unnamed US officials disclosed that Ridgway had dispatched the Japanese germ warfare criminals Shiro Ishii, whom he had been keeping, from Tokyo to Korea to participate in drafting the US plan for germ warfare. These three people were precisely three of the five war criminals that the Soviet Union proposed to be tried by an international special military tribunal in its note of February 1, 1950. In 1951, the US Department of Defense also hired Nazi germ warfare criminal Schreiber as a consultant to the US Air Force's "Global Preventive Medicine Department" and listed his work as "classified and not to be discussed." (US "Time" magazine, March 10, 1952)

On January 27, 1952, the eve of the American aggressors launching germ warfare, the US military newspaper "Stars and Stripes" published a statement by Brigadier General Creasy, head of the Research and Development Department of the US Army Chemical Corps, in Washington on the 25th, saying: "Bacterial poison gas and radioactive materials may prove to be the cheapest weapons to conquer the enemy." Brigadier General Rox, deputy commander of the corps, said the same thing on the 22nd of the same month. After the start of germ warfare, in March of the same year, Major General Bullen, commander of the US Army Chemical Corps, requested the US Congress to allocate funds for germ warfare. At the same time, reactionary American newspapers, such as "U.S. News & World Report," openly propagandized and defended the use of germ weapons. It brazenly violated the facts and said: "There is currently no international agreement prohibiting germ warfare." The Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, clearly stipulates the prohibition of the use of germ weapons. By 1938, forty countries had ratified and acceded to this protocol, which upholds humanitarianism, but when the US President sent this document to the US Senate on January 12, 1926, the Senate refused to ratify it. On April 8, 1947, Truman simply withdrew it in order to carry out inhumane germ warfare. The US government's refusal to ratify and withdraw the Geneva Protocol is a blatant manifestation of the American aggressors' malicious conspiracy to launch and expand germ warfare.

(II)
On January 28, 1952, the Korean side discovered that the American aggressors were conducting large-scale germ warfare in Korea. Subsequently, we discovered that the American aggressors had expanded it to northeastern China. While conducting germ warfare, the US government used its news agencies to carry out various denials and spread rumors, falsely claiming that the crimes of germ warfare were "natural epidemics in Korea and China." But the facts refuted this lie. The investigation reports of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by American Imperialism, and the International Scientific Commission, which were displayed in the exhibition hall, confirmed the crimes of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare in Korea and northeastern China. The handwritten confessions of US Air Force prisoners of war Enoch and Quinn, which are more than forty pages long, not only confessed that they had dropped germ bombs in Korea, but also admitted that they had successively received specialized training in germ warfare and atomic warfare at the US Air Force ground schools in Iwakuni, Japan, and Gunsan, Korea. Although the confession of wounded American prisoner Brown is only three pages long, it also proves that the American aggressors used artillery shells to spread germs in addition to dropping germ bombs from airplanes. He confessed that a soldier of the 65th Infantry Regiment of the US 3rd Division told him that this infantry regiment had fired bacterial shells at the positions of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the second half of February 1952.

Let us listen again to the confessions of US Air Force prisoners Enoch and Quinn. When the narrator turns on the wire recorder, we can hear the voice of a man speaking English. They confessed that from August to December 1951, they had heard one to three lectures on germ warfare. The lecturer explained that the listeners must strictly keep the contents of the lecture secret. The lecturer also told them about various weapons for conducting germ warfare and how to use "many terrible, strange, and rarely heard germs." In terms of insects that can be used to carry germs, many insects such as flies, fleas, mosquitoes, and lice were mentioned. The lecturer also told them that when airplanes dropped germ bombs, they should fly lower and slower than usual in order to protect the lives of the germs-carrying insects inside the bomb. From January 4 to 11 this year, they dropped germ bombs four times in Hwangju, Junghwa, southeast of Pyongyang, and north of Gunuri in Korea. Each time, they flew as low as 200 to 500 feet...

In order to understand the effectiveness of germ weapons, the American murderers also parachuted a batch of special agents into the front and rear of Korea around March 15. This batch of special agents was soon captured by us. They confessed that their mission was to investigate the effects of bacteria, to investigate what infectious diseases had occurred in North Korea, to investigate whether there were many flies, fleas, and insects in places where infectious diseases occurred, the degree of infection, as well as the mortality rate and the epidemic prevention situation. Why study these problems? Rosebury, the former director of the Airborne Infection Department of the Detrick Camp germ weapon factory in the United States, answered in his book "Peace or Pestilence." He said: "There is a big difference between germ bombs in cold storage and bacteria released from germ bombs to kill people, livestock, and plants. Before germ bombs are used, their effects cannot be accurately known." (See pages 98-99 of the book) The American "Science Digest" of April 1951 also said this: A commander conducting germ warfare yearns to know the most timely intelligence about his target of attack. Obviously irrefutable, the special agents sent by the US military to spy on the intelligence of the effects of germ warfare and Enoch and Quinn are equally powerful witnesses to the American aggressors' germ warfare.

(III)
The exhibition displayed many real objects and pictures examined by experts: 150-pound four-compartment germ bombs, parachute-type germ containers, and chalky germ bombs, etc. Regarding the use of these parachute-type germ containers for insect bombs, the American aggressors once argued that this was just a propaganda bomb and a parachute flare. However, on April 5 of this year, the American news agency Associated Press reported: Sykes, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee of the US House of Representatives, publicly told the press after listening to the secret testimony of Bullen, commander of the US Army Chemical Corps: "He (referring to Bullen) said: The tools for spreading bacteria in enemy territory are simple, and the troops now have sufficient storage of this equipment... such as containers currently used to drop propaganda leaflets." And those so-called "flares" not only have particularly small umbrellas, but also the paper inside has no traces of burning.

These are not all or the main weapons of the American aggressors in conducting germ warfare. Other pictures and real objects of germs-carrying insects in the exhibition tell us that many of the thrown germs-carrying insects are mostly attached to some objects that people do not pay attention to, or are directly scattered from airplanes. According to the inspection of more than 50 experts in microbiology, entomology, pathology, epidemiology, clinical medicine, toxic chemistry, plant pathology, and veterinary medicine in our country, these germs-carrying insects include human fleas, house flies, black flies, specimen insects, wolf spiders, large house flies, midges, dung flies, black springtails, etc., as well as small field mice, feathers, frogs, catfish, small fish, clams, corn kernels, soybean pods, leaves, etc., two or thirty kinds. The large-scale appearance of these germs-carrying insects is undoubtedly ironclad evidence of the American aggressors' germ warfare. This is not only proved by the frequent intrusion of American aircraft into the airspace of North Korea and northeastern China and the various germ weapons and poisons that have been discovered, but also by the season, climate, and the places where certain poisonous insects are distributed. For example, after American planes intruded into Fushun in northeastern China in early March, a large number of black springtails, oil gourds, house flies, and locusts were found on the steel and cement stands of the Fushun racecourse six feet above the ground. Insects that only begin to be active in May in the Northeast, but we found them in large numbers in the cold climate of March, and they were all discovered after the intrusion of American planes.

Every picture shows that these insects are poisonous after expert inspection. For example, on the night of April 4, 1952, American planes attacked the sky over Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province. On the morning of the 5th, in 31 of the 45 villages in Xinmin, Minzhong, Gongyi, and Gongnong four villages in the tenth district of the county, small field mice were found. After inspection by bacterial experts Ji Shuli and Cui Qisheng, it was proved that these small field mice carried plague bacilli. On March 15, the large house flies dropped by American planes in Shenyang City were inspected by bacterial experts Jing Guanhua and Zhu Jiming, and typhoid bacilli were found. For another example, the feathers scattered by American planes in Beijingzi Village, Andong, were inspected by experts Xin Jun and Jing Guanhua, and it was proved that they all carried anthrax bacilli. Cholera vibrio, hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella, smut fungus, soybean purple spot disease fungus, and wheel spot disease fungus, which endanger human life and the lives of livestock, poultry, and plants, were also detected in other insects and ordinary objects dropped by many American aircraft.

The plague created by the American aggressors in Korea also confirmed their crimes. Korea has not had plague for many years. A report on Korean epidemics issued by the US Department of the Navy in 1946 also affirmed that "Korea has not had plague for many years." However, in areas where the American aggressors repeatedly dropped rats from the air, we found plague patients. Our dearest comrades Ge Quanshu and Chang Jinlong died of the plague infectious disease directly caused by the American aggressors in this cold season below zero degrees Celsius. In Korea, cholera usually occurs in August, September, and October, but this time Pyongyang City was discovered in early March when the weather was still quite cold. Moreover, the direct medium for cholera infection was the white paper bags and flies in the paper bags scattered by American planes during the air raid on Pyongyang on the night of March 4. Pyongyang resident Han Sang-guk and his two grandsons died on the fourth day after the paper bags were discovered. Experts also found a large number of active cholera vibrios in Han Sang-guk's stool. Based on the above facts, we can be completely sure that the plague and true cholera discovered in Korea are by no means "natural epidemics," but are caused by the germ warfare of the American aggressors.

The American aggressors have conducted large-scale germ warfare against the people of Korea and China, which has been conclusively proven and cannot be denied. We accuse the American aggressors of their heinous crimes to all peace-loving people in the world, and sincerely request all peace-loving people in the world to take concerted action to judge the war criminals who conduct germ warfare, in order to uphold human justice and defend world peace.

    美国政府进行细菌战的真凭实据
    ——记“美国政府细菌战罪行展览会”
    本报记者　克　惠
    美国侵略者不顾国际公约，对朝、中两国进行惨无人道的细菌战的滔天罪行，铁证如山，引起了朝、中人民和全世界人民的无比愤怒和同声斥责。尽管美国政府仍在百般狡赖，妄图推卸罪责，然而墨写的谎言掩盖不了血写的事实。最近在北京举行的美国政府细菌战罪行展览会，就提供了许多无可辩驳的血淋淋的罪证。
    （一）
    陈列在展览会上的许多美国军政方面负责官员的言论和由资产阶级报刊透露出来的材料，完全证明了美国侵略者进行的细菌战是经过长期有计划的准备的。一九四六年一月四日，美国前陆军生物作战委员会主席米尔克在“关于细菌战争给陆军部长柏德逊的报告”中透露：美国政府在一九四一年就开始设立研究和制造细菌武器的专门机构，而自一九四三年以后，细菌战的研究工作加速进行。同年四月间，美国陆军部在美国马里兰州佛烈德利克地方设立了一个大规模制造细菌武器的中心工厂——狄特里克兵营。曾在狄特里克兵营参加制造细菌武器的美国哥伦比亚大学教授提奥多尔·罗斯培里，在一九四七年五月号的“免疫学杂志”上发表了关于细菌战的长篇报告，证明用飞机撒布空气传染和昆虫传染的病菌，有“最大的军事用途”。一九四八年一月，美国“总统空军政策委员会”主席芬立脱
    （现任美国空军部长）在给杜鲁门的报告中也主张把生物武器放在军事上的首要地位。一九四九年，罗斯培里写了一本题为“和平或瘟疫”的书。这本书进一步证实了狄特里克兵营是研究生物战的中心，并且揭露这个细菌武器工厂在第二次世界大战后一直在继续工作。一九四九年三月十二日，正当国民党匪帮土崩瓦解的时候，前美国国防部长福莱斯特叫嚣着在必要时使用细菌武器，说“细菌或它们的有毒的生成物可以有效地用作战争武器”。一九五○年四月，即美国发动侵朝战争的前两个月，美国堪萨斯州陆军“指挥与参谋学校”的校刊“军事评论”杂志却恬不知耻地公然鼓吹和讨论如何进行细菌战了。这些事实充分证明了美国侵略者早在十年以前就开始准备进行细菌战了。
    展览会上许多材料又证明了，美国政府的细菌战是在和日本细菌战犯、前日本陆军军医中将石井四郎、兽医少将若松次郎和北野政藏等人的勾结下进行的。一九五一年十二月五日电通社仰光消息：有两名不愿吐露姓名的美国官员吐露，李奇微已经把他所豢养的日本细菌战犯石井四郎等从东京派遣到朝鲜，参加拟订美国进行细菌战的计划。而这三个人正是苏联在一九五○年二月一日的照会中提议设立国际特别军事法庭加以审判的五个战犯中的三个。一九五一年美国国防部还聘请纳粹细菌战犯施莱勃任美国空军“全球预防医疗部”的顾问，并且把他的工作列入“机密的和不能加以讨论的一类”。
    （一九五二年三月十日美国“时代”杂志）
    一九五二年一月二十七日，即美国侵略者发动细菌战的前夕，美军“星条报”发表了美国陆军化学兵团研究发展处处长克莱西准将二十五日在华盛顿的谈话，说：“细菌毒气与放射性物质可能证明是征服敌人的最廉价的武器。”该兵团副司令罗克斯准将在同月二十二日也说过同样的话。在开始细菌战以后，即同年三月间，美国陆军化学兵团司令布伦少将要求美国国会拨款从事细菌战。与此同时，美国的反动报刊，如“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志，便公然为使用细菌武器进行宣传和辩护了。它狂妄地违反事实地说：“现在并没有禁止细菌战的国际协定”。在一九二五年六月十七日日内瓦议定书中曾明文规定禁止使用细菌武器。这纸维护人道主义的议定书到一九三八年为止已有四十个国家先后批准和加入，但美国总统于一九二六年一月十二日将此书送交美国参议院时，该院却拒绝批准。一九四七年四月八日，杜鲁门为了进行惨无人道的细菌战，索性将它撤回。美国政府之拒绝批准和撤回日内瓦议定书，乃是美国侵略者发动和扩大细菌战的恶毒阴谋的露骨表现。
    （二）
    一九五二年一月二十八日朝鲜方面发现美国侵略者在朝鲜进行大规模的细菌战，随后我国又发现美国侵略者又把它扩大到我国东北境内。美国政府在进行细菌战的同时，又通过其新闻机关进行各种抵赖的宣传，散布谣言，将细菌战的罪行诬称为“朝鲜和中国境内的天然瘟疫”。可是事实驳斥了这种谎言。展览室里陈列着的国际民主法律工作者协会调查团、美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团和国际科学委员会的调查报告，证实了美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北进行细菌战的罪行。美国空军战俘伊纳克、奎恩的长达四十余页的亲笔供词，不仅供认了他们在朝鲜投掷过细菌弹，并且又承认他们曾先后在日本岩国和朝鲜群山美国空军地面学校接受关于细菌战和原子战争的专门训练。负伤美俘勃朗的供词虽然只有短短的三页，但同样证明了美国侵略者除了从飞机上投掷细菌弹以外，并且还利用炮弹撒布细菌。他供称：美军第三师第六十五步兵团的一个士兵告诉他，这个步兵团曾在一九五二年二月下半月对中国人民志愿军的阵地发射过细菌炮弹。
    让我们再听一听美国空军俘虏伊纳克和奎恩的供词吧。当讲解员一扭动钢丝录音机，我们就可以听到说着美国话的男子的声音。他们供认，在一九五一年八月至十二月曾听过一次到三次关于细菌战的讲课，讲课人在讲授时说明，听课人对于讲课内容必须严守秘密。讲课人还告以进行细菌战的各种武器和如何使用“很多可怕的奇怪的不常听到的细菌”。在可用以带菌的昆虫方面，曾提到蝇、蚤、蚊、虱等许多昆虫。讲课人并告诉过他们，飞机在投掷细菌弹时要飞得比寻常低而慢，以便保护弹内带菌昆虫的生命。在今年一月四日至十一日，他们分别在朝鲜黄州、中和、平壤东南、军隅里以北等地投过四次细菌弹。每次投弹时都低飞到二百英尺到五百英尺。……
    为了了解细菌武器的效能，美国杀人犯曾在三月十五日前后在朝鲜前后方空降一批特务，这批特务不久便为我们俘获了。他们供称：他们的任务是调查细菌的效果，调查北朝鲜地区已发生了哪些传染病，调查发生传染病地方的苍蝇、跳蚤、虫子多不多，被传染的程度如何，以及死亡率、防疫情形等。为什么要调查研究这些问题呢？美国狄特里克兵营细菌武器工厂的前空投传染部主任罗斯培里在他的“和平或瘟疫”一书中作了回答。他说：“放在冷藏库里的细菌弹和从细菌弹里撒放出来的、用以杀害人、畜和植物的细菌之间是有极大差别的。细菌弹在被使用之前，其效果是无法准确地知道的。”（见该书九十八—九十九页）一九五一年四月号的美国“科学文摘”也说过这样的话：一个进行细菌战的指挥官渴望知道关于他的攻击目标的最及时的谍报。显然无可置辩的，美军派来刺探细菌战效果情报的特务和伊纳克、奎恩同样是美国侵略者进行细菌战的有力的人证。
    （三）
    展览会上陈列着许多实物和专家检验的图片：一百五十磅的四格型细菌弹、带伞纸筒型细菌容器和白垩质细菌弹等。对于这些昆虫弹的带伞纸筒型细菌容器的使用，美国侵略者曾经狡辩着说，这不过是一种宣传品炸弹和带伞照明弹。但是本年四月五日美国通讯社美联社报道：美国众议院拨款小组委员会主席赛克斯，在听取了美国陆军化学兵团司令布伦的秘密作证以后，公开对报界说：“他（指布伦）说：在敌人领土上散播细菌的工具是简单的，这种装备现在部队已有充分储存……如目前用以投掷宣传传单的容器。”而那些所谓“照明弹”，不仅伞特别小，而且里面的纸也没有燃烧过的痕迹。
    这些还不是美国侵略者进行细菌战的全部或主要武器。展览会上的另一些图片和带菌昆虫的实物告诉我们，很多被投掷下来的带菌的昆虫，大多附在一些人们所不注意的物体上，或者直接由飞机上撒布下来。据我国微生物学专家、昆虫学专家、病理学专家、流行病学专家、临床医学专家、毒物化学专家、植物病理学专家、兽医学专家等五十余人的检验，这种带菌昆虫有人蚤、家蝇、黑蝇、标本虫、狼蛛、大家蝇、摇蚊、粪蝇、黑跳虫等昆虫，以及小田鼠、羽毛、青蛙、鲶鱼、小鱼、蛤、玉米粒、大豆茎荚、树叶等二、三十种。这些带菌昆虫的大量出现，无疑是美国侵略者进行细菌战的铁证。这不仅为美国飞机的频繁侵入北朝鲜和我国东北领空以及已发现的各种细菌武器、毒物等所证明，而且也为这些毒虫出现的季节、气候和某些毒虫分布的场所等情况所证实。例如三月初美国飞机侵入东北抚顺后，在抚顺跑马场的钢骨水泥看台上离地六尺高的地方发现了大批黑跳虫、油葫芦、家蝇、蝗虫。在东北都是在五月间才开始出生活动的昆虫，但我们却在三月寒冷的气候中大量发现，而且都是在美国飞机侵入后发现的。
    每一张图片都显示：这些昆虫经专家检验都带有毒菌。如一九五二年四月四日夜，美国飞机袭入黑龙江省甘南县上空，五日晨在该县第十区新民、民众、公议、工农四个村的四十五个屯中，有三十一个屯发现小田鼠，经细菌专家纪树立、崔其盛检验证明，这种小田鼠带有鼠疫杆菌。三月十五日美国飞机在沈阳市投下的大家蝇、经细菌专家景冠华、朱既明检验，查出了伤寒杆菌。再如美机在安东北井子村所撒布的羽毛，经专家辛钧、景冠华的检验证明，都带有炭疽杆菌。在其它许多美国飞机投下的昆虫和通常的物体上也分别检验出霍乱弧菌、出血性败血症巴氏杆菌、黑粉菌、大豆紫斑病菌、轮纹病菌等危害人类生命和家畜、家禽、植物生命的病原体。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜制造的瘟疫，也证实了它的罪行。好多年以来朝鲜没有发生过鼠疫。美国海军部一九四六年印发的关于朝鲜流行病的报告也肯定说“朝鲜多年来没有鼠疫”。可是在美国侵略者多次从空中投放老鼠的地区，我们发现了鼠疫病人。我们最可爱的人葛权书、常金龙同志就在这摄氏零度以下的寒冷季节里，死在美国侵略者直接造成的鼠疫传染病中。在朝鲜，霍乱多在八、九、十月发生，而这次平壤市却在天气还相当寒冷的三月初旬发现。而且直接传染霍乱的媒介又是美国飞机在三月四日夜间空袭平壤时所散布的白色纸包和纸包中的蝇类。平壤居民韩相国和他的两个孙子就是在发现纸包以后的第四天死去的。专家们在韩相国的大便里同样发现了大量的活动的霍乱弧菌。根据以上事实，我们可以完全肯定，朝鲜所发现的鼠疫和真性霍乱，决不是“天然瘟疫”，而是美国侵略者的细菌战所造成的。
    美国侵略者对朝中人民大规模地进行细菌战，已经证据确凿，不可抵赖的了。我们向全世界一切爱好和平的人们控诉美国侵略者的万恶罪行，并且诚恳地要求全世界一切爱好和平的人们，一致行动起来，裁判进行细菌战的战争罪犯，以维护人类正义，保卫世界和平。
