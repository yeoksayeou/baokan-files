To the Editor:

Seeing the news of the judicial reform movement being carried out in various places, I am very excited. In addition to fully supporting this wise measure of the Central Committee, I also want to tell you about a very infuriating thing.

Zhou Xiongshi, a poor working woman from Fengshan Township, Huang'an County, Hubei Province, has been running around for more than a year, enduring hardship, to accuse the capitalist and landlord Cheng Folan of owing her deceased husband, Zhou Dianhua, the wages he deserved during his lifetime. The case was successively heard by the Wuhan Third District People's Court and the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, but because the judges handling the case in these two courts had a strong old legal view and old judicial style, the case was delayed for a long time and has not yet been resolved reasonably.

Cheng Folan was a big landlord and big capitalist during the Japanese puppet and Kuomintang eras, with property known as "seventh in the Yangtze River, first in Wuhan." His feudal exploitation in the countryside was significant, and farmers have repeatedly sought to settle accounts with him. Because of his resistance, the Wuhan First District People's Court once detained him. In the past, he engaged in a lot of feudal exploitation in his industrial and commercial operations, and many workers are now seeking to settle accounts with him. In the past, he used deceptive means to deduct workers' wages, euphemistically calling it "investment" with "per capita money." Zhou Xiongshi is accusing him and seeking to settle accounts with him for the wages and so-called "dividends" of "per capita money" that her deceased husband, Zhou Dianhua, should have received but did not when he worked at Hankou Hongqingsheng Flower Shop (belonging to Cheng Folan). Zhou Dianhua died of overwork and vomiting blood while working.

Although these facts have been introduced by the district, county, and Hubei Provincial Farmers' Association where Zhou Xiongshi is located and there are other proofs, the Wuhan Third District People's Court and the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, which accepted the case, still believe that the evidence is insufficient and vaguely ruled that Zhou Xiongshi lost the case. Zhou Xiongshi repeatedly requested a retrial, but was rejected. Later, on the advice and urging of the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the court reopened the case. After the retrial, it has been proven that the debt is true, but the court still does not order the settlement of accounts according to the books, but adopts the so-called "mediation" method, intending to close the case carelessly. They admitted that the first judgment was wrong, but did not correct the wrong judgment. Some judges even complained for Cheng Folan, saying to Zhou Xiongshi: "We have investigated Cheng Folan's situation clearly. There are too many people seeking to settle accounts with him. He really can't get the money... You get 800,000, as a mediation." Zhou Xiongshi disagreed, and the judges added from 800,000 to 1.5 million, 1.8 million, 2 million, and 3 million, as if doing business; they also persuaded Zhou Xiongshi: "It is better to get less than to get more, and better to get it now than to get less. If the time is delayed, you will suffer." Finally, they even threatened Zhou Xiongshi: "If you don't accept these millions, we have no way to solve this case."

During each trial, the court did not allow Zhou Xiongshi to make a full statement, only listening to Cheng Folan's sophistry, making the case unresolved. Zhou Xiongshi stayed in Wuhan for more than ten months, delaying production and spending money, but the case has not been settled. What makes Zhou Xiongshi most dissatisfied is that when the Wuhan Third District People's Court questioned the case, Cheng Folan said to the judge: "I have something to do and can't stay long. I have to go first." The judge replied: "If you have something to do, go first."

Zhou Xiongshi is determined to fight to the end with the landlord and illegal capitalist, and firmly believes that the people's government will not wrong her and can support her. However, the two courts that accepted the case wrongly defended Cheng Folan in that way. I really doubt what position these judges are standing on.

The Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate attaches great importance to this case and has specially sent people to Huang'an County for investigation. The materials obtained can definitely confirm that Zhou Xiongshi's request is completely reasonable. I hope that the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court will quickly and fairly resolve this case; and starting from this case, in conjunction with the judicial reform movement, earnestly examine the work.

### 最高人民法院中南分院及武汉市第三区人民法院审判人员  竟帮助违法资本家向工人家属赖账  读者建议对此案作公平合理的解决

    最高人民法院中南分院及武汉市第三区人民法院审判人员
    竟帮助违法资本家向工人家属赖账
    读者建议对此案作公平合理的解决编辑同志：
    看到各地法院开展司法改革运动的消息，我非常兴奋。我除了完全拥护中央这种贤明措施之外，还要告诉你一件使人非常气愤的事情。
    湖北省黄安县峰山乡周熊氏是一个贫苦的劳动妇女。她为了控告资本家兼大地主程佛兰拖欠她的亡夫周殿华生前应得的工资，一年多来到处奔跑，饱尝艰苦。该案先后经武汉市第三区人民法院及最高人民法院中南分院审理，但由于这两个法院中承办该案的审判人员有着浓厚的旧法观点和旧司法作风，致使该案拖延很久，仍没有得到合理的解决。
    程佛兰是日伪及国民党时代的大地主、大资本家，财产号称“长江第七，武汉第一”，他在农村中的封建剥削部分很大，农民已先后多次找他清算。因为他顽抗，武汉市第一区人民法院曾关押过他。他过去经营工商业中有很多封建性的剥削，很多工人现在都找他清算。过去他用欺骗手段克扣工人的工资，美其名为“人份钱”的“投资”。周熊氏控告他并向他清算的，是她的亡夫周殿华在汉口宏庆升花号（属程佛兰）帮工时所应得而未得到的工资和所谓“人份钱”的“红利”。周殿华是在帮工时操劳过度而吐血致死的。
    这些事实虽经周熊氏所在的区、县及湖北省农民协会介绍并有其他证明，但受理该案的武汉市第三区人民法院及最高人民法院中南分院仍认为证据不全，糊里糊涂地判决周熊氏败诉。周熊氏屡次要求复判，都被驳回。后在最高人民检察署中南分署的建议和催促之下，法院才重新审理。经过重审，已证明债务属实，但法院仍不判决照账清算，而采取所谓“调解”的办法，意图马虎结案。他们承认第一次判错了，但不改正错误的判决。有个别审判人员甚至替程佛兰诉苦，对周熊氏说：“程佛兰的情况我们调查清楚了，向他清算的人太多，他实在拿不出钱来，……你得八十万算了，作为调解。”周熊氏不同意，审判人员就像做生意似的，由八十万加到一百五十万，一百八十万，二百万，三百万；还劝周熊氏说：“多得不如少得，少得不如现得。时间拖长了，该你吃亏。”最后更威胁周熊氏：“你倘若不接受这几百万，我们没办法解决这案子。”
    在每次审讯的时候，法院不让周熊氏尽情申诉，光听程佛兰的狡辩，使案件一直纠缠不决。周熊氏留在武汉十多个月，耽误了生产。耗费了钱，而案子迟迟未得了结。最使周熊氏不满的，是在武汉市第三区人民法院问案时，程佛兰对审判员说：“我有事不能久留，要先走了。”审判员答：“你有事你先走吧。”
    周熊氏要和大地主、违法资本家斗争到底，坚信人民政府不会冤枉她，能为她撑腰。但受理这一案件的两个法院，却是那样错误地为程佛兰辩护。我真怀疑这些审判人员究竟是站在什么立场。
    最高人民检察署中南分署十分重视此案，现已特地派人到黄安县作了调查，所得材料已可肯定周熊氏的要求是完全合理的。我希望最高人民法院中南分院迅速公平合理地审结本案；并从本案着手，结合司法改革运动，认真检查一下工作。
