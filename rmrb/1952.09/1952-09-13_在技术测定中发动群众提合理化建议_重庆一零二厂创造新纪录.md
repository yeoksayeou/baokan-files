Mobilizing the Masses to Propose Rationalization Suggestions During Technical Measurement
Chongqing No. 102 Factory Creates New Record

During the second round of technical measurement at Chongqing State-owned No. 102 Factory, the masses were mobilized to propose rationalization suggestions and improve production. As a result, each unit of the factory has been creating new records in recent days, creating favorable conditions for determining new quota standards.

Through the publicity work of technical measurement, the workers of the factory recognized the importance of tapping production potential and strengthened their confidence in increasing production and practicing economy. The trade union also established a "Tip Platform" and proposed fifteen rationalization suggestions topics, enabling workers to find ways to tap production potential. One topic was to shorten the time for electric furnace steel to enter the furnace. The Li Minzhe group focused on this topic, used their brains, and proposed improvement methods. Since the trial implementation, the results have been very significant. Now the smelting time per furnace has been shortened by about 20 minutes, thereby increasing production. In the past, the cupola furnace often could not supply the needs of electric furnace steelmaking. After technician Yang Qinggeng and the workers of the furnace studied and improved the melting zone of the cupola furnace body and used quartz sand instead of white stone bricks to strengthen the fire resistance of the cupola furnace and prolong the life of the furnace, the output was finally increased; the whole year can increase production and save wealth of more than 1 billion yuan for the country.

On August 13, a total of 21 rationalization suggestions were made in the factory. These suggestions have played a great role in promoting production. On August 14, the workers of each shift of the factory worked together to complete 116% of the daily plan within 24 hours, which is the highest production record of the factory since liberation. On this basis, on the 15th, everyone continued to find ways to shorten idle time and smelting time. The Xu Bingliu group, the Huang Shengrong group, and others exceeded the production plan of the day by 119%. The life of the electric furnace has also been extended. From July 29 to August 18, a total of 100 furnaces were smelted, creating a new record since the furnace was put into operation. Now the workers of the factory are continuing to find tips and advance towards higher goals.

    在技术测定中发动群众提合理化建议
    重庆一零二厂创造新纪录
    重庆国营一零二厂第二场在进行技术测定中，发动群众提合理化建议，改进生产，因而该场各单位连日创造新纪录，为确定新的定额标准创造了有利条件。
    该场通过技术测定的宣传工作，工人们认识了挖掘生产潜力的重要性，坚定了增产节约的信心；工会又设立了“窍门台”，提出合理化建议课题十五个，使工人们更找到了挖掘生产潜力的途径。有一个课题是缩短电炉钢水进炉时间的。李敏哲小组就针对这个课题，开动脑筋，提出了改进办法。试行以来，成效很大，现每炉熔炼时间已缩短约二十分钟左右，从而增加了产量。化铁炉过去经常供应不上电炉炼钢需要，经技术员杨庆赓和该炉工人研究改进化铁炉炉身的熔化带，并利用石英砂代替白石砖，加强化铁炉的耐火性和延长炉子寿命，终使产量增加了；全年可为国家增产节约财富十亿元以上。
    八月十三日，全场提合理化建议共二十一件。这些建议对生产都起了很大推动作用。八月十四日，该场三班各组工人齐心努力，在二十四小时之内，产量完成每日计划的百分之一百一十六，这是解放以来该场的最高生产纪录。在这个基础上，十五日大家继续想办法缩短空隙时间和冶炼时间。许炳六小组、黄生荣小组等超过当天生产计划百分之一百一十九。电炉的寿命也延长了，从七月二十九日到八月十八日共冶炼了一百炉，创造了该炉开炉以来的新纪录。现在该场工人正继续找窍门，向更高的指标前进。
