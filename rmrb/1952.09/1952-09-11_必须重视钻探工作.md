    Must Emphasize Drilling Work
    One of the greatest difficulties in our country's large-scale economic construction is the lack of clarity regarding underground resources. The data left to us by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers is not only pathetically scarce but also extremely inaccurate and unreliable, making it fundamentally impossible to use as a basis for capital construction. Therefore, surveying and drilling have become one of the most important preparatory works for capital construction. However, the current state of drilling work in various mines or other enterprises is unsatisfactory. According to the advanced experience exchange conference on drilling work in North and East China convened by the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, as well as the situation in other units, the following two issues must be resolved to ensure the smooth progress of drilling work:

    First, leading cadres at all levels must truly value drilling work and vigorously solve various problems in drilling work. Currently, many leading cadres are short-sighted, believing that drilling work is not directly related to the completion of current production tasks, and therefore do not pay attention to it. The error of this view is very obvious. Because geological drilling is the primary task of capital construction. Without thorough surveying and drilling, design and construction are impossible. Without correct design and construction, there is no way to complete production tasks. Therefore, in order to do a good job in capital construction and to welcome large-scale national economic construction, we must make the greatest efforts to carry out surveying and drilling and actively prepare data for design work. Otherwise, it will delay the progress of our capital construction and prevent our construction work from proceeding according to the national plan, and the losses will be immeasurable.

    Second, leading cadres at all levels and relevant engineering and technical personnel must clearly understand the purpose of drilling work. The purpose of drilling work is to clarify the situation of underground resources and prepare accurate and reliable data for capital construction. This is a very simple principle. However, in actual work, some units only focus on creating new drilling records without paying attention to taking rock cores, hydrological conditions, or studying and identifying rock cores. Some technical personnel drill for their own research purposes, drilling within a range of no more than twenty meters, resulting in only knowing what minerals exist but not how much, making it impossible to use as a basis for capital construction. We do not object to breaking new records or conducting research work. However, breaking new records and research work must be closely integrated with the country's actual needs and with the national construction plan. Otherwise, they will have no value.

### 必须重视钻探工作

    必须重视钻探工作
    我们国家进行大规模经济建设的最大困难之一，是地下资源情况不明。国民党反动统治者留给我们的资料不但少得可怜，并且极不准确极不可靠，根本不能做为基本建设的根据。因而，勘测钻探就成为基本建设的最重要的准备工作之一。但是，目前各矿山或其他企业的钻探工作的状况是不能令人满意的。根据煤矿管理总局召开的华北、华东钻探工作先进经验交流大会以及其他单位的情况看，要使钻探工作顺利开展，必须解决以下两个问题：
    首先，各级领导干部必须真正重视钻探工作，大力解决钻探工作中的各种问题。目前还有许多领导干部眼光短浅，认为钻探工作和完成当前生产任务没有直接关系，就不重视。这种看法的错误是十分明显的。因为，地质钻探是基本建设的首要工作，没有周密的勘查钻探就不可能设计和施工，而没有正确的设计和施工，也就谈不到完成生产任务了。因此，为了作好基本建设工作，迎接大规模的国家经济建设，必须以最大的努力去进行勘查钻探，积极地为设计工作准备资料。否则，就会延缓我们基本建设的进度，使我们的建设工作不能按照国家计划进行，其损失将是无可计量的。
    其次，各级领导干部和有关的工程技术人员，必须明确地认识钻探工作的目的何在。钻探工作是为了弄清地下资源情况，为基本建设准备准确可靠的资料，这本来是很简单的道理。但是，在实际工作中，有的单位却只为了创造钻进新纪录而不注意采取岩心，不注意水文情况，也不研究鉴定岩心；还有些技术人员是为了自己研究某些问题而钻探，钻来钻去不超过二十公尺范围以内，结果只知道有什么矿，但不知有多少，无法作基本建设的依据。我们并不反对创新纪录，也不反对研究工作。但是，创新纪录和研究工作必须和国家的现实需要密切结合，和国家建设计划结合。否则，它们就没有什么价值了。
