    The walls of the first exhibition room of the American germ warfare crime exhibition are covered with 23 giant photographs with explanations in Chinese, Soviet, English, and French. The words and pictures in these photos are the historical facts of the U.S. government’s preparation for and open conduct of germ warfare. Most of these photos were taken from American and British magazines and were originally displayed in a bright glass cabinet in the middle of the exhibition room.

    The first photo in the exhibition room shows the summary of a report given by Milke, former chairman of the Biological Warfare Committee of the Chemical Warfare Service of the U.S. Army, to then U.S. Secretary of War Patterson on January 4, 1946 (originally published in the British Keesing's Modern Archives from February 2-9, 1946). This report revealed that the United States had begun setting up specialized institutions to research and manufacture bacteriological weapons as early as the end of 1941. By the summer of 1942, the U.S. government approved the establishment of a bacteriological weapons research organization under the "Federal Security Agency" under the name of "War Research Division," with Milke as the director. At the end of 1943, in order to expand and accelerate the preparation for germ warfare, the U.S. government expanded the "War Research Division" into the "Biological Warfare Committee," which belonged to the Army Chemical Warfare Service. Milke served as the chairman of this committee. Under Milke's leadership, it expanded to four large-scale germ factories. These four germ factories were located in: Camp Detrick in Maryland, established in April 1943 – the central factory for researching and manufacturing bacteriological weapons; the field test station in Mississippi, established in the summer of 1943; a large-scale factory for manufacturing bacteriological weapons established in Indiana in early 1944; and the field test station in Utah, established in the summer of 1944. Milke shamelessly said in a report: "It must be stated that bacteriological weapons can be developed and do not require huge sums of money or large-scale production equipment." The barbarity of the U.S. government revealed in this report alarmed the American people. The U.S. government immediately ordered the revocation of the report it had originally approved and prohibited people from discussing issues related to the report.

    During the same period, the U.S. Department of the Navy was also preparing for germ warfare. According to a report released by the U.S. Department of the Navy on January 4, 1946, Vice Admiral McIntire, Surgeon General of the Navy, ordered the commencement of this heinous activity in April 1943. The organization in charge of this activity was the "Naval Medical Research Institute" led by Columbia University biology professor Kluger (this report was published in the British "Keesing's Modern Archives" from February 2-9, 1946). The report also stated that the research results "show that using an artificial epidemic as a tool of war is possible." In January 1948, Finletter, the current U.S. Secretary of the Air Force, who was then chairman of the "President's Air Policy Commission," submitted a report to U.S. President Truman on the ideas of American military and political strategy with an authoritative nature (quoted from "Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy" by Blackett, published in London in 1950). In his report, he emphasized that the U.S. monopoly on atomic weapons would not last long, and that bacteriological weapons could rival atomic weapons for large-scale destruction. Under the guidance of such ideas, the U.S. government more frantically expanded the preparations for germ warfare. On March 12, 1949, then U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal publicly clamored: "Our research shows that bacteria or their products can be effectively used as weapons of war. Our research results also make us realize that this work cannot be ignored in peacetime and must continue on a sufficient scale so that we can obtain appropriate defense and be able to use this weapon when necessary." (Originally published in the British "Keesing's Modern Archives" from July 9-16, 1949)

    In May 1947, former U.S. Camp Detrick bacteriological weapons factory airborne infection department director Rosebury, et al., published a lengthy report on germ warfare (originally published in the May 1947 issue of the American "Journal of Immunology"). This report listed that the U.S. germ factory had discovered 33 kinds of bacteria and toxins suitable for germ warfare five years ago, proving that the airborne and insect-borne dispersal of germs by aircraft had the greatest military use. On October 8, 1951, the American "Life" magazine listed 16 kinds of bacteriological weapons to deal with humans, livestock, and crops. Rosebury revealed in his book "Peace or Pestilence," published in 1949, that many laboratory staff at Camp Detrick had contracted diseases such as undulant fever, tularemia, psittacosis, and anthrax, among the 16 bacteriological weapons, when manufacturing bacteriological weapons. The April 1951 issue of the American "Science Digest" monthly reprinted a paper by British scientist Pinch, stating that the United States had manufactured a cluster bacteriological bomb. This bacteriological bomb consists of several grenade barrels, each weighing four pounds, and each grenade barrel contains a small amount of concentrated bacterial culture.

    In order to expand and develop its sinister activities, the U.S. government used the top germ warfare criminals of militarist Japan and Nazi Germany and some bacteriology experts. Disregarding the just demands of the people of the world, the U.S. government shamelessly shielded some germ warfare criminals from deserved punishment.

    In 1947, the U.S. occupying forces in West Germany extensively recruited Nazi German germ warfare experts. On February 10, 1950, a U.S. State Department representative announced that 600 "German scientists" were working in laboratories and research institutes led by the U.S. Army Department. In 1951, the U.S. Department of Defense hired Nazi germ warfare criminal Schreiber to participate in the "U.S. Air Force School" in Texas, USA (see the U.S. "Daily Worker" on March 13, 1952, and the U.S. "National Guardian" on March 12, 1952).

    In the winter of 1951, Ridgway sent Japanese germ warfare criminal Lieutenant General Shiro Ishii, commander of Unit 731 of the former Japanese Kwantung Army, Veterinary Major General Jiro Wakamatsu, commander of Unit 100, and Masazo Kitano, who succeeded Shiro Ishii as commander of Unit 731, to Korea to directly participate in the pre-war preparations for the U.S. military's impending open germ warfare. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch from Rangoon on December 5, 1951, citing two unnamed U.S. officials, in the winter of 1951, Shiro Ishii and others, under the orders of Ridgway, took all the necessary equipment for germ warfare, left Tokyo for Korea, and were ordered to draft a plan for conducting germ warfare in winter.

    On January 22 this year, Brigadier General Rucks, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, publicly talked about the U.S. military's expanded plan to use chemical and bacteriological weapons for mass killing of humans in the United States. Three days later, Brigadier General Clacy, Director of Research and Development of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, publicly promoted that bacteria, poison gas, and radioactive materials might prove to be the cheapest weapons to conquer the enemy. The cost of combat is much less than with any other means of warfare (originally published in the European edition of the U.S. military newspaper "Stars and Stripes" on January 27, 1952). What an appalling and infuriating bloody confession!

    According to existing materials, the U.S. military openly and extensively conducted germ warfare in Korea starting in January this year. On February 29, the U.S. military expanded the germ warfare to Northeast China. Under the severe condemnation of the world's righteous people, the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which speaks for the Wall Street bosses in the United States, published an article this year that shamelessly said: "There is no international law prohibiting germ warfare." However, the Geneva Protocol signed on June 17, 1925, clearly stipulates the prohibition of the use of bacteriological weapons:
        "Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Opened for signature at Geneva, June 17, 1925). The undersigned Plenipotentiaries, on behalf of their respective Governments: Whereas the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world; and Whereas the prohibition of such use has been declared in Treaties to which the majority of Powers of the world are Parties; To the end that this prohibition shall be universally accepted as a part of International Law, binding alike the conscience and the practice of nations; Declare:
    That the High Contracting Parties, so far as they are not already Parties to Treaties prohibiting such use, accept this prohibition, agree to extend this prohibition to the use of bacteriological methods of warfare and agree to be bound as between themselves according to the terms of this declaration….”
    By 1938, forty countries had successively ratified and acceded to this protocol. However, when U.S. President Coolidge sent this protocol to the U.S. Senate on January 12, 1926, the Senate refused to ratify it. U.S. President Truman even further withdrew this protocol from the Senate on April 8, 1947 (载一九四三年“美国政府出版局”出版的“国际法摘要”、一九四七年四月六日至十二日美国“时事汇编”第七卷第三三七期). From this, it is not difficult for people to understand that the U.S. aggressors' conduct of germ warfare was premeditated for a long time!

    历史的事实
    新华社记者  濯非
    美国细菌战罪行展览会第一陈列室的四周的布幕上，挂着用中、苏、英、法四国文字说明的二十三张巨幅照片。这些照片上的文字和图片，是美国政府从开始准备到公开进行细菌战的历史的事实。这些照片，大多是从美国和英国的杂志上摄取下来的，原本都陈列在陈列室中间的一个明亮的大玻璃橱里。
    陈列室的第一张照片上印着前美国陆军部化学作战处生物作战委员会主席米尔克在一九四六年一月四日所发表的给当时美国陆军部长柏德逊的报告摘要（原文载一九四六年二月二日至九日的英国基辛氏现代文库）。这个报告透露：美国早在一九四一年底就开始设立专门机构，从事细菌武器的研究和制造。到一九四二年夏，美国政府批准在“联邦安全局”之下设立以“战争研究处”为名的细菌武器的研究机关，由米尔克担任处长。一九四三年底，美国政府为扩大和加速进行细菌战的准备工作，将“战争研究处”扩大为“生物作战委员会”，属于陆军化学作战处。这个委员会由米尔克担任主席。在米尔克的领导之下，扩大到四个规模庞大的细菌工厂。这四个细菌工厂分设在：一九四三年四月成立的马利兰州狄特里克兵营——研究和制造细菌武器的中心工厂；一九四三年夏建立的密西西比州的野外试验站；一九四四年初在印第安纳州建立的规模很大的制造细菌武器的工厂；一九四四年夏建立的犹他州的野外试验站。米尔克在一份报告中恬不知耻地说：“必须说明，细菌武器是能够发展的，也不需要巨额金钱，不需要大规模的生产设备。”这份报告所透露的美国政府的野蛮行为惊动了美国人民。美国政府立即下令撤销了它原来就同意了的报告，并禁止人们讨论与这份报告有关的问题。
    同一时期，美国海军部也进行着细菌战的准备工作。根据美国海军部一九四六年一月四日发表的报告，海军军医总监麦克印台尔海军中将在一九四三年四月就下令进行这种罪恶的活动，主持这活动的机关是在哥伦比亚大学生物学教授克鲁格领导之下的“海军医药研究所”（这份报告刊在一九四六年二月二日到九日的英国“基辛氏现代文库”）。报告上还说，研究的结果“表明以一种人为的流行病来作为战争的工具是具有可能性的”。一九四八年一月，现任美国政府空军部长，当时担任“总统空军政策委员会”主席的芬立脱，曾向美国总统杜鲁门提出一个具有权威性质的关于美国军事和政治策略思想的报告（引文见布莱克特著、一九五○年在伦敦出版的“原子能的军事与政治后果”）。他在报告中强调指出美国对于原子武器的独占将不能维持多久，而细菌武器作为大规模的破坏之用可以与原子武器匹敌。美国政府就在这样的思想指导之下，更加疯狂地扩大了进行细菌战的准备工作。一九四九年三月十二日，当时的美国国防部长福莱斯特尔公开叫嚣道：“我们的研究表明：细菌或其产物可以有效地用来作为战争武器。我们研究的结果又让我们认识到：这方面的工作在平时亦不能忽视，必须在充分的规模上继续进行，以便我们获得适当的防御，使我们将来在必要时能够使用这个武器。”（原载一九四九年七月九日至十六日的英国“基辛氏现代文库”）
    一九四七年五月，前美国狄特里克兵营细菌武器工厂空投传染部主任罗斯培里等发表了关于细菌战的长篇报告（原载一九四七年五月号美国“防疫学杂志”）。这份报告列举出美国细菌工厂在五年以前已发现了三十三种适合于细菌战的细菌和毒素，证明用飞机撒布空气传染和昆虫传染的病菌有最大的军事用途。一九五一年十月八日美国“生活”杂志曾列举对付人、畜和农作物的十六种细菌武器。罗斯培里在一九四九年发表的“和平或瘟疫”一书中透露：狄特里克兵营的许多实验室工作人员在制造细菌武器时，曾染上十六种细菌武器中的波状热、野兔热、鹦鹉热、炭疽等病。一九五一年四月号美国“科学文摘”月刊转载英国科学家品奇的论文，说美国已经制造了一种簇状细菌弹。这种细菌弹由每个重四磅的几个榴弹筒组成，每个榴弹筒内装有小量浓缩的细菌培养液。
    美国政府为了扩大和发展自己的罪恶勾当，利用了军国主义日本和纳粹德国的头号细菌战犯和一些细菌学专家。美国政府不顾世界人民的正义要求，无耻地掩护一些细菌战犯免受应得的惩罚。
    美国驻西德占领军当局在一九四七年曾大事搜罗纳粹德国的细菌战专家。一九五○年二月十日，美国国务院代表曾宣布有六百名“德国科学家”在美国陆军部领导的实验室和研究所里工作。一九五一年美国国防部聘请纳粹细菌战犯施莱勃参加美国德克萨斯州的“美国空军学校”工作（见一九五二年三月十三日美国“工人日报”，又见一九五二年三月十二日美国“国民前卫报”）。
    一九五一年冬天，李奇微就派日本细菌战犯前日本关东军七三一部队长官军医中将石井四郎、一○○部队长官兽医少将若松次郎和继石井四郎任七三一部队长官北野政藏到朝鲜直接参加美国军队即将公开进行细菌战的战前准备工作。据电通社一九五一年十二月五日仰光电引述拒绝透露姓名的两名美国官员所透露的消息称，一九五一年冬天，石井四郎等奉李奇微之命，携带了进行细菌战的一切必要装备，离开东京到达朝鲜，并奉命起草一个关于在冬季进行细菌战的计划。
    今年一月二十二日，美国陆军化学兵团副司令罗克斯准将在美国公然谈到美国军方利用大规模屠杀人类的化学与细菌武器的扩大计划。三天以后，美国陆军化学兵团研究发展处处长克莱西准将公开宣传细菌、毒气与放射性物质可能证明是征服敌人的最廉价的武器。较用其他任何战争方式，作战耗费都要来得少些（原载一九五二年一月二十七日美国军方报纸欧洲版“星条报”）。这是多末令人发指、令人愤恨的血腥供状！
    据现有的材料，美国军队在今年一月起就在朝鲜公开地大规模地进行细菌战。二月二十九日，美国军队又把细菌战扩大到我国东北。在世界正义人类的严厉指斥下，替美国华尔街老板们说话的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志，在今年刊载了一篇专文，这篇文章竟恬不知耻地说：“并没有禁止细菌战的国际公法。”然而一九二五年六月十七日签订的日内瓦议定书上却是明明白白地规定着禁止使用细菌武器：
        “关于禁用窒息性、有毒的或其它瓦斯以及细菌武器的议定书（一九二五年六月十七日起开始签署）。下列各署名全权代表，代表其政府：鉴于在战争中使用窒息性、有毒的或其他瓦斯以及类似的液体、物质或器具，既经文明世界普遍舆论所谴责；鉴于世界上大部分国家所参加的条约中已宣布禁止使用；为使此种禁止被普遍接受为国际法之一部分，并对各国的良知和行动同样有拘束力起见；兹宣布：
    缔约国，就尚未参加其他禁用毒气条约的缔约国而言，兹接受此项禁止，同意将此项禁止扩展及于细菌武器之使用，并同意彼此间依照本宣言之规定互相约束……。”
    这个议定书至一九三八年为止，已有四十个国家先后批准和加入。但美国总统柯立芝于一九二六年一月十二日将此议定书送发美国参议院时，参议院拒绝予以批准。美国总统杜鲁门竟于一九四七年四月八日进一步将此议定书从参议院撤回（载一九四三年“美国政府出版局”出版的“国际法摘要”、一九四七年四月六日至十二日美国“时事汇编”第七卷第三三七期）。从这里人们就不难理解，美国侵略者进行细菌战是蓄谋已久的了！
