    Wife Killer Wen Xiangting Sentenced to Death
    Editor: Ren Changgeng, of Renyi Town, Lingshi County, Shanxi Province, disregarding his daughter's happiness, forced his seventeen-year-old daughter, Ren Lingxiu, to marry Wen Xiangting, a rogue from Xiyuan Village, Second District, in the same county, in December 1950, in order to obtain seven stone of wheat as "bride price." Because the woman was underage for marriage, the Second District People's Government did not allow them to marry. On January 2, 1951, Ren Changgeng had them secretly married. Ren Lingxiu did not marry willingly, so the couple often quarreled after marriage and had no affection for each other. Ren Lingxiu proposed a divorce, but her father, Ren Changgeng, blocked it, and Wen Xiangting also harbored resentment. On the night of November 17, 1951, Wen Xiangting inhumanely twisted several leather ropes together, soaked them in water, and beat Ren Lingxiu to death. After this tragedy occurred, the County People's Government immediately sent cadres to investigate and arrested the murderer Wen Xiangting and the feudal patriarch Ren Changgeng to bring them to justice. After all the facts of the case were clarified, the County People's Government, the County People's Court, and the County Democratic Women's Federation jointly convened a public trial on July 26 of this year, attended by women representatives from the county and about 3,000 people from 17 administrative villages near the county seat. After the deceased's sister, Ren Lingxiang, tearfully accused him, the masses unanimously demanded that the murderer who killed the woman be severely punished. Finally, the temporary court accepted the demands of the masses and decided to sentence the murderer Wen Xiangting to death and execute him immediately; Ren Changgeng, who arranged his daughter's marriage, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment.

    杀妻犯温相廷被判处死刑
    编辑同志：山西省灵石县仁义镇任长庚，为了索取七石麦子的“采礼”，不顾女儿的幸福，在一九五○年十二月强迫十七岁的女儿任玲秀和同县二区西原上村流氓温相廷结婚。因女方不到结婚年龄，二区人民政府不准他们结婚。一九五一年一月二日，任长庚让他们暗暗地结婚了。任玲秀不是自愿结婚的，所以结婚后夫妻间常常吵闹，根本谈不上感情。任玲秀提出离婚，她父亲任长庚横加阻拦，温相廷也怀恨在心。一九五一年十一月十七日夜，温相廷竟毫无人性地把数根皮绳拧在一起，沾上水，活活把任玲秀打死。这一惨案发生后，县人民政府即派干部前往检查，把凶犯温相廷和封建家长任长庚逮捕法办。该案全部案情弄清后，县人民政府、县人民法院、县民主妇女联合会联合在今年七月二十六日召开了全县妇女代表和县城附近十七个行政村群众共约三千多人的公审大会。死者妹妹任玲香悲痛控诉后，群众一致要求严惩杀害妇女的凶犯。最后，临时法庭接受群众的要求，决定判处凶犯温相廷死刑，并立即执行；对包办女儿婚姻的任长庚，判处徒刑一年。
