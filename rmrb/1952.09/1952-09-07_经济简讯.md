    From August 5th to 10th, Ulanqab League, Suiyuan Province, held a league-wide materials exchange conference in the form of the Bailingmiao Temple Fair. More than 5,000 people participated in the conference, including representatives of Mongolian, Han, and Hui people, lamas, agricultural and pastoral representatives, and trade representatives from cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Guisui, Baotou, and various banners and districts in Ulanqab League. The total purchase and sale volume reached 2,515 million yuan.
    It was the first time that Ulanqab League held a materials exchange conference on the grassland. During the exchange conference, herdsmen sold a large amount of livestock products, with a total value of 660 million yuan, accounting for 26.3 percent of the total transaction volume of the conference. In accordance with the spirit of "production promoting trade and trade guiding production," the conference conducted publicity and education on the native products produced by herdsmen on the grasslands, such as licorice root, desert cistanche, *Astragalus membranaceus*, and hair moss, which did not meet the specifications, so that herdsmen would pay attention to mastering the seasonality and paying attention to the specifications. The materials exchange conference also opened up sales channels for many slow-selling local specialties and increased the purchasing power of herdsmen.
