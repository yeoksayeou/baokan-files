Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. According to the London "Daily Worker", a grand peaceful gathering of people from all walks of life in London was held in Queen's Hall on the evening of the 14th. At the meeting, Archbishop of Canterbury Johnson delivered a speech, enthusiastically calling for maintaining friendship with "the creative New China." He said: New China "has become a sentinel for world peace, and it is engaged in tremendous efforts to bring the world closer to the days of universal harmony." Johnson went on to say: The lives of millions of people in China have become richer, which has increased the possibility of trade. He expressed regret over the increasing decline in trade between Britain and China.

Johnson talked about religious freedom in New China, pointing out that the Chinese church has received assistance from the People's Government and has severed ties with imperialism.

Johnson ended his speech with words of praise for the Chinese people: "I admire your great construction. I admire your water conservancy projects and protective forest belts. I admire your clean cities, your new industries, and new agriculture. But, above all, what I admire most is the great transformation of the moral standards of all your people: a transformation of putting others before oneself. This is the true source of all the great things that have happened in China." Johnson said: This great spirit of one for all and all for one is precisely the spirit that generations have longed for. It is this spirit that leads to peace.

General Secretary of the National Union of Railway Workers, Figgins, spoke at the meeting, saying that the resolution of the British Trades Union Congress calling for full trade with China reflects the understanding of trade union members that "all countries must live together."

The Duke of Bedford and Labor MP Davis also spoke at the meeting, calling for striving for peace in Asia.

    在伦敦各界人士盛大和平集会上
    坎特伯雷教长约翰逊呼吁与新中国友好
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】据伦敦“工人日报”报道：伦敦各界人士十四日晚在女皇大厦举行盛大的和平集会。会上坎特伯雷教长约翰逊发表演说，热情地呼吁与“富有创造性的新中国”保持友好。他说：新中国“已成为世界和平的前哨战士，它正在从事巨大的努力，使世界大步接近普世和睦的日子”。约翰逊接着说：中国千百万人民的生活已富裕起来，这就增加了贸易的可能性。他对于英国与中国之间贸易的日益衰退表示惋惜。
    约翰逊谈到新中国的宗教自由，指出中国教会得到人民政府的协助，并已割断与帝国主义的联系。
    约翰逊以赞扬中国人民的话结束他的发言：“我佩服你们的伟大建设。我佩服你们的水利工程和防护森林带。我佩服你们的清洁的城市，你们的新工业和新农业。但是，除了这以外，我最佩服的是你们全体人民的道德标准的伟大转变：一种先为人后为己的转变。这是中国所发生的一切伟大事物的真正根源。”约翰逊说：这种我为人人和人人为我的伟大精神正是世世代代所渴望的精神。导向和平的也正是这种精神。
    全国铁路工人工会总书记费金斯在会上发言说：英国职工大会要求与中国进行充分贸易的决议，反映出工会会员们对于“所有国家必须共同生活”这一点是有了解的。
    培德福德公爵和工党议员戴维斯也在会上发表演说，呼吁争取亚洲和平。
