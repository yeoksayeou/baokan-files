Achievements of People's Judicial Work in the Past Three Years
Minister of Justice of the Central People's Government, Shi Liang

People's judicial work is one of the important weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship. Over the past three years, under the unified leadership of people's governments at all levels and with the active support of the broad masses of people, people's judicial work throughout the country has carried out a series of tasks to defend the achievements of the people's democratic revolution, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, consolidate the order of the new society, promote various social reforms, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people. At the same time, in the process of work, it has continuously carried out and is carrying out its own reform and construction, and has achieved great successes and rich experience, thus increasingly demonstrating the superiority of the people's judicial system.

The new China's people's judicial work was established and improved under the guidance of Article 17 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which states, "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." The new China's people's judicial system is one of the fruits of victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China with countless blood from long-term revolutionary struggles. It is precisely the opposite of the judicial systems of all reactionary ruling classes, especially the Kuomintang reactionary government, which were based on hostility and oppression of the broad masses of people. It firmly stands on the position of safeguarding the interests of the broad masses of people—especially the working people—and arises from and serves the people's revolutionary struggle. Looking back at the construction of the new China's people's judicial work in the past three years, one cannot help but feel excited that the new China's people's judicial work is moving forward healthily on the road of people's democratic rule of law.

In the past three years, the first major achievement of the new China's people's judicial work has been to support the just struggles of the broad masses of people with judicial power and to guarantee that these just struggles are carried out to complete victory with leadership, planning, and order, based on our country's program, policies, and decrees. When people's governments at all levels were leading the peasants in carrying out the earth-shaking land reform movement, a group of unlawful landlords were doing everything possible to obstruct and sabotage its development. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this movement, our people's judicial organs, together with relevant government departments and mass organizations, organized people's courts to punish in a timely manner this group of unlawful landlords who resisted land reform and conspired to "counter-seize" power, as well as bullies who oppressed and harmed the people, thereby consolidating the fruits of victory won by the peasant masses in this just struggle. After the Chinese people achieved nationwide revolutionary victory, the U.S.-Chiang agents and bandits and other remaining counter-revolutionary forces were unwilling to die. They attempted to restore their rule and conspired to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, seriously endangering the interests of the state and the people. Our people's judicial organs, together with the people, launched a vigorous suppression of the counter-revolutionary movement, resolutely suppressing counter-revolutionary elements with legal weapons, greatly striking at the enemy's arrogance, and effectively guaranteeing the stability of social order. When our country's economy was recovering and moving towards development, unlawful bourgeois elements brazenly attacked our state organs, stealing state property, spreading bourgeois corrupt and decadent ideas, and adding to the poison left over from the old society, which caused many state workers to be infected with the bad habits of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Therefore, under the call of Chairman Mao and the unified leadership of people's governments at all levels, the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements were launched. Our people's judicial organs again organized people's courts with relevant parties and the broad masses of people, and in accordance with the spirit of the Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption, punished unlawful bourgeois elements and some degenerate and corrupt elements, thereby repelling the attack of unlawful bourgeois elements, enforcing state discipline, shifting social atmosphere, and paving the way for the new China's large-scale economic construction. The feudal marriage system of coercion, arranged marriage, and sale, left over by the reactionary rulers of old China, caused extremely deep suffering to the masses. After liberation, the broad masses of women, in various social reform movements, first of all in the land reform movement, obtained land rights, raised their awareness, and, coupled with the propaganda and education of the new Marriage Law, put forward their legitimate demands to get rid of feudal oppression and strive for freedom of marriage. Our people's judicial organs and relevant government departments and mass organizations actively supported these legitimate demands, thereby powerfully striking at the feudal marriage system, eliminating feudal ideas in marital relations, and making happy and harmonious new families increasingly widespread, improving the social status of women, and changing the past dependent thinking of "marrying a man to get clothes and food." Many women who could not hold their heads high in the old society happily became active members and glorious models in industrial and agricultural production and learning, greatly contributing to social economic and cultural construction. However, eliminating feudal marital views relating to the oppression of women is a long-term ideological transformation process. Therefore, there are still many shortcomings in the current implementation of the Marriage Law, and these shortcomings still need our continuous efforts to overcome.

In the past three years, the second major achievement of the new China's people's judicial work has been to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the judicial work of the people's democratic power during the revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan over the past 20 years, and to further create and continue to create organizational forms and working methods that "rely on the people, connect with the people, and facilitate the people" through various mass movements to transform the old social system and establish social order. In addition to the creation of people's assessor system, collective mediation, on-site trials, circuit trials, inquiry offices, people's reception rooms, and other mass line working methods and systems by people's courts at all levels, the people's courts established in various mass movements are particularly worthy of praise. In their work, the people's courts first use the trial of criminals to conduct legal and disciplinary propaganda and policy explanations to the masses, mobilize and educate the masses, and expose reactionary elements and lawbreakers, and then rely on the strength of the masses to conduct investigation, trial, and handling. The same is true of relying on the masses to solve problems themselves in the struggle against the enemy and in mediating disputes among the people. The ways in which the people's courts rely on the masses are diverse and extremely rich. They absorb relevant government departments and representatives of relevant masses to participate in the work at any time according to the needs of the mass movement (such as the establishment of people's courts during land reform to absorb peasant associations and peasants to participate, the establishment of people's courts during the "Five-Anti" campaign in cities to absorb workers and representatives of industry and commerce, etc.), and at the same time report to various mass representative conferences and obtain their support, thereby severely punishing criminals, educating the masses, and training a large number of workers, peasants, and women to become outstanding people's judicial workers. In the great land reform movement and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, many outstanding worker-peasant judges emerged. In Shanghai alone, the "Five-Anti" people's courts absorbed 600 workers, shop assistants, and housewives to participate in the work. The broad masses happily said: "Since the beginning of the world, there has never been a government like today's that hands over cases to the common people to handle!" At the same time, the people's court is also the most convenient system for the people. Wherever there are cases, it goes there to handle them. It goes deep into the countryside and mines at any time, which can not only avoid the waste of working people's work time, but also handle cases quickly and accurately. Some cases that could not be resolved for years were quickly resolved by it. It can be seen that the people's court is a great creation that combines leadership with the broad masses and is best at serving the mass movement. It plays a huge role in promoting and guaranteeing various mass movements: in the early stage of the movement, punishing a small number of reactionary elements or lawbreakers who are guilty of heinous crimes, arouse great public anger, and openly resist the movement and sabotage laws and decrees, clears the way for the movement and mobilizes the masses. In the process of the movement, the policy is fully reflected by distinguishingly handling a batch of criminals with varying degrees of guilt. In the later stage of the movement, the strength of the masses is relied on to properly deal with all the criminals exposed in the movement in accordance with government policies and decrees. It is obvious that all these excellent systems and styles of the people's courts are incomparable to the Kuomintang's anti-people bureaucratic systems and styles of being divorced from the masses, sitting in court to interrogate, making subjective assumptions, and "judge-ism."

In the past three years, the third major achievement of the new China's people's judicial work has been the nationwide judicial reform movement carried out and being carried out by people's judicial organs at all levels to maintain and improve their purity. Because we took over the mess of the Kuomintang reactionary court and retained many old judicial personnel who had not been reformed, they brought the Kuomintang's anti-people's old legal views and old yamen style into the people's court. We did not have time to reform them, so some courts were left untouched or changed very little; some old cadres with weak will were also captured by old legal views. These old legal views and old yamen style harmed the interests of the country and the people. The judicial reform movement is a movement against the old legal views and the reform of the entire people's judicial organs. Through this movement, not only was a group of bad elements who violated laws and regulations and had deep-rooted bad habits that could not be reformed eliminated, and a large number of outstanding workers, peasants, and women who emerged in various mass movements were selected and sent to enrich people's judicial organs at all levels; but also all people's judicial cadres were educated to further profoundly recognize the harm of the Kuomintang's reactionary old legal views and old judicial style to the country and the people, initially established the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought state view and legal view, and strengthened the concept of serving the people wholeheartedly, thereby drawing a clear ideological boundary between the old and new laws; at the same time, this great movement further greatly promoted the people's rule of law spirit of the people's court, and created a new system and new style that closely connects with the masses and absorbs the people to participate in the people's judicial construction. All this has laid a good foundation for further consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship of the new China and improving the people's judicial work.

The above achievements should first of all be attributed to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China. Under this correct leadership, the role that can be brought into play without limit should also be attributed to the collective wisdom and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and people. Although there are still many shortcomings, even serious shortcomings, in our work, we are full of confidence and are able to gradually correct and overcome them. Now is the time to celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. We are very happy to see that our great motherland is about to enter large-scale planned economic construction. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi earnestly taught us: "Without the democratization of our country, without the development of the new democratic regime, we cannot guarantee the new democratic economic development and the industrialization of the country."
(Speech at the Third People's Congress of Beijing Municipality)

In order to welcome and guarantee large-scale economic construction, all our new China judicial workers must firmly remember and follow Chairman Mao's wise instruction on "strengthening the people's state machine," and make our people's judicial organs, like the people's army and the people's police, a hundred times stronger, and do the people's judicial work better.

    三年来人民司法工作的成就
    中央人民政府司法部部长 史良
    人民司法工作是人民民主专政的重要武器之一。三年来，全国各地的人民司法工作，在各级人民政府统一领导和广大人民积极支持下，为了保卫人民民主革命的成果，镇压反革命的活动，巩固新社会的秩序，推动各种社会改革及保护人民合法权益，进行了一系列的工作；同时，在工作进程中不断地进行了并进行着本身的改革与建设，获得了巨大的成绩与丰富的经验，因而日益显示了人民司法制度的优越性。
    新中国的人民司法工作，是在中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第十七条“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度”的原则指导下建立和健全起来的。新中国的人民司法制度是中国人民在中国共产党领导下，用无数鲜血从长期革命斗争中换来的胜利果实之一，恰与历来反动统治阶级，特别是国民党反动政府以敌视和压迫广大人民群众为基础的司法制度相反，它是牢固地站在维护广大人民——首先是劳动人民——利益的立场之上，从人民革命斗争中产生，并为人民革命斗争服务的。回顾一下三年来新中国人民司法工作的建设，不能不令人兴奋地感觉到，新中国人民司法工作是在人民民主的法治道路上健康地前进。
    三年来，新中国人民司法工作的第一个重大成就，就是根据我们国家的纲领、政策与法令，以司法力量支持了广大人民群众的各种正义斗争，并保证了这些正义斗争有领导、有计划、有秩序地进行到彻底的胜利。当着各地人民政府正在领导着农民进行翻天覆地的土地改革运动时，一批不法地主却百般恶毒地进行阻碍和破坏它的开展，为了保证这一运动的顺利完成，我们的人民司法机关与各有关政府部门及人民群众团体组织了人民法庭，及时地惩办了这批抗拒土地改革和阴谋“反把”的不法地主和压迫与残害人民的恶霸，巩固了农民群众在这一正义斗争中获得的胜利果实。在中国人民取得了全国范围的革命胜利后，美蒋特务匪徒们及其他残余的反革命势力是不甘心死亡的，他们妄图复辟，阴谋进行反革命活动，严重地危害了国家与人民的利益。我们的人民司法机关就和人民在一道展开了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，坚决地用法律武器镇压了反革命分子，大大地打击了敌人的凶焰，有力地保障了社会秩序的安定。当我国家经济正在恢复并走向发展时，不法资产阶级分子竟向着我们国家机关猖狂地进攻，盗窃国家财产，散布资产阶级腐化堕落的思想，再加上旧社会遗留下来的污毒，就使不少国家工作人员沾染了贪污、浪费和官僚主义的恶习，因此，在毛主席的号召之下，在各级人民政府统一领导之下，开展了伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动，我们的人民司法机关又与各有关方面组织人民法庭并与广大群众在一起，依照惩治贪污条例的精神，惩治了不法资产阶级分子及一部分蜕化变质的贪污分子，从而打退了不法资产阶级分子的进攻，严肃了国家的法纪，转移了社会风气，给新中国的大规模经济建设铺平了道路。旧中国反动统治者所遗留下来的强迫、包办、买卖的封建婚姻制度给群众所造成的痛苦是极为深重的，解放后广大的妇女群众，在各种社会改革运动中，首先是在土地改革运动中，获得了土地权，提高了觉悟，再加上新婚姻法的宣传教育，纷纷提出摆脱封建压迫、争取婚姻自由的正当要求。我们的人民司法机关与各有关政府部门及群众团体对于这些正当要求积极予以支持，因而有力地打击了封建的婚姻制度，扫除了婚姻关系上的封建思想，而使美满和睦的新家庭日益普遍地建立起来，妇女的社会地位提高了，改变了过去“嫁汉嫁汉，穿衣吃饭”的依赖思想，许多在旧社会抬不起头来的妇女愉快无比地成为工农业生产与学习中的积极分子和光荣模范，大大地有助于社会经济与文化建设事业。但肃清有关压迫妇女的封建的婚姻观点是一个长期的思想改造过程，所以，目前贯彻婚姻法的工作还存在着不少的缺点，这些缺点还须我们不断努力克服。
    三年来新中国人民司法工作的第二个重大成就，就是通过各种改造旧社会制度与建立社会秩序的群众运动，继承和发扬了二十余年来国内历次革命战争和抗日战争时期人民民主政权司法工作的优良传统，进一步创造了并继续创造着“依靠人民、联系人民、便利人民”的组织形式和工作方法。除各级人民法院创造了人民陪审制、集体调解、就地审判、巡回审判、问事处、人民接待室等走群众路线的工作方法与制度外，特别值得赞扬的是在各种群众运动中建立起来的人民法庭。在工作中，人民法庭首先用审判罪犯，向群众进行法纪宣传和交代政策，发动和教育群众，检举反动分子和违法分子，然后又依靠群众力量进行调查、审判与处理。在对敌斗争上如此，在调处人民内部纠纷上也同样地依靠群众自己解决问题。人民法庭依靠群众的方式是多种多样，异常丰富的。它随时根据群众运动的需要，吸收有关政府部门和有关群众代表参加工作
    （如土地改革时成立人民法庭吸收农会与农民参加，城市进行“五反”时成立人民法庭吸收工人和工商联代表参加等），同时又向各种群众性的代表会议报告工作并取得其支援，从而严惩了罪犯，教育了群众，同时并培养了大批工农及妇女群众成为优秀的人民司法工作者。在伟大的土地改革运动与“三反”、“五反”等运动中曾涌现出许多优秀的工农审判员，仅上海一地的“五反”人民法庭就吸收了六百个工人、店员及家庭妇女参加工作，广大的群众高兴地说：“自开天辟地以来，从来没有像今天这样的政府，把案子交给老百姓办！”同时人民法庭又是最便利人民的制度，那里有案子，它就到那里去办事，它随时深入农村及工矿，既可免除劳动人民误工的浪费，办案又迅速、准确，有些经年不能解决的案子很快就被它解决了。可见人民法庭是领导与广大群众相结合的、最善于为群众运动服务的伟大创造，它对于各种群众运动起着巨大的推动和保证作用：在运动初期，惩办少数罪大恶极、民愤极大、公然拒抗运动破坏法令的反动分子或违法分子，为运动扫清道路，借以发动群众，在运动进程中，则以有区别地处理一批罪恶轻重不一的罪犯，以全面体现政策；在运动后期则依靠群众力量，按政府政策法令，对在运动中揭发出来的所有罪犯进行了妥善的处理。显然可见，人民法庭这一切优良的制度和作风和国民党反人民的脱离群众、坐堂问案、主观臆断、“推事主义”等官僚主义制度与作风是无可比拟的。
    三年来新中国人民司法工作的第三个重大成就，就是各级人民司法机关为了保持和提高其纯洁性，进行了并进行着全国范围的司法改革运动。由于我们接收了国民党反动法院的烂摊子，留用了许多未经改造的旧司法人员，他们把国民党反人民的旧法观点和旧衙门作风带进了人民法院，我们还来不及改造他们，致有些法院还原封未动或改变很少；也有些意志不坚定的老干部做了旧法观点的俘虏，这些旧法观点与旧衙门作风危害了国家和人民的利益。司法改革运动就是反对旧法观点和改革整个人民司法机关的运动，通过这一运动，不仅清除了一批违法乱纪和恶习甚深不堪改造的坏分子，选派了在各种群众运动中涌现出来的大批工农妇女优秀分子，去充实各级人民司法机关；而且教育了全体人民司法干部，进一步深刻地认识了国民党反动的旧法观点与旧司法作风对于国家与人民的危害性，初步树立了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的国家观和法律观，并加强了全心全意为人民服务的观点，从而划清了新旧法律的思想界限；同时，通过这一伟大的运动更大大地发扬了人民法庭的人民法治精神，创造了密切联系群众并吸收人民群众参加人民司法建设的新制度与新作风。这一切都为更进一步巩固新中国的人民民主专政和健全人民司法工作奠定了良好的基础。
    以上这些成就，首先应归功于毛主席和中国共产党的正确领导，在这一正确领导之下，得以无限制地发挥出来的作用，又应归功于广大干部和群众的集体智慧与创造力。虽然现在我们的工作还存在着许多缺点，甚至严重的缺点，但我们是满怀着信心，是能够逐步地改正和克服的。现在适值庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年之际，我们十分欣喜地看到，我们伟大的祖国却将进入大规模有计划的经济建设。刘少奇副主席剀切地教导我们：“没有我们国家的民主化，没有新民主主义的政权的发展，就不能保障新民主主义的经济发展和国家的工业化。”
    （在北京市第三届人民代表会议上的讲话）为了迎接和保障大规模的经济建设，我们全体新中国的司法工作者必须牢牢记住和遵行毛主席关于“强化人民的国家机器”的英明指示，使我们的人民司法机关和人民军队、人民警察一样，百倍地加强起来，把人民司法工作做得更好。（新华社）
