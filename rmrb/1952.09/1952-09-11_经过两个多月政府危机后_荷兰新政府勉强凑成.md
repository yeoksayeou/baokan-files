Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, September 9th: After more than two months of government crisis, the four bourgeois parties of the Netherlands, including the Labour Party, the Catholic People's Party, the Christian Historical Union, and the Anti-Revolutionary Party, barely managed to form a coalition government on September 2nd, headed by former Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Drees.

Prior to the formation of this new government, the Netherlands had been without a formal government for more than two months. The situation in the Netherlands accurately reflects the political crisis in the countries of the North Atlantic bloc.

The protracted government crisis in the Netherlands is a direct consequence of the Dutch general election on June 25th. Because the Dutch people firmly oppose war, the Dutch ruling clique has been unable to properly complete the arms expansion and war preparation tasks assigned by the United States in recent years. This situation has made the United States very dissatisfied. Former Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, Eisenhower, once blamed the Dutch government for its weak and incompetent arms expansion. When the Netherlands held general elections on June 25th this year, the Americans planned to use this election to drive the Dutch Communist Party out of Parliament and bring extreme reactionary parties to power to form a "strong" government, so as to rapidly fascistize and militarize the Netherlands. However, in the election struggle, the Dutch people shattered the Americans' conspiracy: the Dutch Communist Party maintained its representation in Parliament, and the Catholic People's Party and the Anti-Revolutionary Party, two extremely reactionary parties, were defeated, and no right-wing party could occupy a majority of seats in Parliament. Reuters acknowledged that the June 25th election had created a political "stalemate" in the Netherlands.

In this situation, the Dutch ruling clique experienced a long-term government crisis. Since the Drees government resigned to the Dutch Queen as usual after the general election on June 25th, the Dutch Queen has successively appointed former Prime Minister Drees, former Minister of the Interior, Catholic People's Party leader Beel, and Labour Party parliamentary leader Tanke to form a new government, but they all failed one after another. The Dutch Queen had to appoint Drees again to engage in cabinet formation activities. Finally, under pressure from the Americans, Drees barely pieced together a team to take the stage. However, according to Agence France-Presse, "the reaction from all sides to the establishment of the new Dutch government is extremely reserved. Observers in The Hague believe that the new government is not as powerful as the previous one."

    经过两个多月政府危机后
    荷兰新政府勉强凑成
    【新华社九日讯】海牙消息：荷兰劳工党、天主教人民党、基督教历史同盟、反革命党等四个资产阶级政党，在九月二日勉强凑成了一个以前任首相、劳工党领袖德里斯为首的联合政府。
    在这个新政府组成以前，荷兰已经有两个多月没有正式政府了。荷兰的情况恰好反映了北大西洋集团各国的政治危机。
    荷兰政府危机的旷日持久，是六月二十五日荷兰大选的直接后果。由于荷兰人民坚决反对战争，近年来荷兰统治集团一直不能很好地完成美国所分派的扩军备战任务。这种情况使得美国非常不满，前任北大西洋集团军队总司令艾森豪威尔就曾经责备荷兰政府扩军不力和软弱无能。今年六月二十五日荷兰举行大选时，美国人盘算着要通过这次大选把荷兰共产党逐出议会，把极端反动的政党捧上台去组成一个“强有力”的政府，以便使荷兰迅速法西斯化和军国主义化。但是，在选举斗争中，荷兰人民粉碎了美国人的阴谋：荷兰共产党保持了它在议会的代表权，天主教人民党和反革命党这两个极端反动的政党遭到了失败，任何一个右翼政党都不能在议会中占据多数席位。路透社承认，六月二十五日的大选已经造成了荷兰政治上的“僵局”。
    在这种情况下，荷兰统治集团就发生了长期的政府危机。自从六月二十五日德里斯政府在大选后循例向荷兰女皇辞职以来，荷兰女皇曾经先后任命前首相德里斯、前任内政大臣、天主教人民党领袖贝尔和劳工党议会党团领袖唐克等组织新政府，但是他们都一个接着一个地失败了。荷兰女皇只好再一次任命德里斯从事组阁活动。最后在美国人的压力下，德里斯才勉强拼凑好一个班子登场。但是，据法新社透露：“各方对于荷兰新政府成立的反应极为保留。在海牙的观察家认为：新政府还没有前任政府那么强大有力。”
