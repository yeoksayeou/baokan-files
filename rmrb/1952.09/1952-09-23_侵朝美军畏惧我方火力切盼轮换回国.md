[Report from this Newspaper] The New York "World Telegram and Sun" published a dispatch from the Korean front on August 27th, describing the disheartening state of morale among the U.S. aggressor troops in Korea with a despondent tone.

While the likes of Harrison are closing their eyes and loudly proclaiming the strong "military pressure" of the U.S. side, the ordinary American soldiers who bear the actual combat tasks on the Korean battlefield are praying day and night not to lose their lives under the powerful artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese side. The dispatch described the terrified feelings of the U.S. soldiers, saying: "The disappointed eyes of the GIs are fixed on Panmunjom. They are terrified by the increasing artillery fire from the Chinese and North Korean side." "The situation is different from before… They fire in frightening quantities, and they shoot accurately and skillfully." The "terrified" American soldiers’ "foxholes are no longer shallow. They are dug very deep… to avoid the howling death (referring to shells and bullets - editor) that attack them day and night." However, as the author of the dispatch described his own fear of our artillery fire, a soldier who had been in Korea for five months crawled out of his bunker for some reason, saying:

"I'm scared too." Seconds after he said this, the soldier was "blown to smithereens by a shell."

The dispatch reported how the U.S. troops in Korea are desperately waiting for the day of rotation, waiting for the day to leave Korea. The dispatch said: "Talk of rotation still constitutes the content of frontline conversation," the American soldiers' "main interest in life is: rotation; when he can go home; when his points accumulate enough to get him out of this country he does not understand..." "The average GI is an unhappy person, helplessly calculating his points, carefully crossing off the days on the calendar, hoping to go home soon." Thus, when the news came that they would have to spend a third winter in Korea, that is, "when the winter gear began to be distributed, a bleak omen appeared in a certain area. The GIs stared at the winter gear with a silent anger." The author of the dispatch said sadly: "An atmosphere of almost despair pervades the entire front," and even "vigorous advances and imminent victory cannot boost their morale."

### 侵朝美军畏惧我方火力切盼轮换回国

    侵朝美军畏惧我方火力切盼轮换回国
    【本报讯】纽约“世界电讯与太阳报”八月二十七日刊载了一篇朝鲜战地通讯，这篇通讯以沮丧的笔调说明了侵朝美军士气一蹶不振的情况。
    当哈利逊之流正在闭着眼睛高叫美方强大的“军事压力”的时候，在朝鲜战场上负担实际作战任务的普通美国士兵却在日夜祈祷不要在朝中方面的强大炮火下丧失自己的生命。通讯叙述美军士兵的惊恐心情说：“大兵们的失望的眼睛瞅着板门店。他们心惊肉跳地望着中国和北朝鲜方面发射的越来越多的炮火。”“现在的情形跟以前不同了。……他们发射的数量多得叫人害怕，他们射击得又正确又巧妙。”“心惊肉跳”的美国士兵的“单人壕，现在已不是浅浅的了。它们被挖得很深，……以避免那些日夜袭击他们的呼啸着的死亡（指炮弹、枪弹——编者）。”可是通讯的作者叙述了他正为我方炮火而感到害怕时，一个在朝鲜呆了五个月的士兵正因故从自己的地堡中爬出来，他说：
    “我也害怕呢。”在他说这句话几秒钟后，这个大兵就“被一颗炮弹炸得粉身碎骨”。
    通讯报道了朝鲜美军是如何急不可耐地等待着轮换的日子，等待着离开朝鲜的日子。通讯说：“关于轮换制的谈话仍然构成了前线谈话的内容”，美国士兵“生活中主要的兴趣是：轮换制；什么时候他可以回家；什么时候他的分数积累得足以使他离开这个他所不了解的国家。……”“普通的大兵都是不愉快的人，他束手无策地计算着他的分数，小心地在月份牌上划去日子，他们希望早日回家。”于是当要在朝鲜度过第三个冬天的消息传来，即“开始发下冬季装备的时候，在某地区呈现了一种肃杀的征兆。大兵们用一种无言的愤怒瞪着这些冬装。”通讯作者悲哀地说：“整个前线上弥漫着一种近乎绝望的气氛”，甚至“猛烈前进和就在眼前的胜利都不能鼓起他们的士气”。
