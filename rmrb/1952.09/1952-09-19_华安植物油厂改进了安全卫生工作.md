    Hua'an Vegetable Oil Factory Improves Safety and Hygiene Work

    Editor: The Hua'an Vegetable Oil Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Anyang City, Pingyuan Province, has ensured that its employees can work with peace of mind due to the attention paid to improving safety and hygiene work by its leading cadres.

    In the past, the factory's safety and hygiene work was not good, and workers had made many suggestions for improvement. Thanks to the leadership's attention to the workers' opinions, significant improvements in safety and hygiene were achieved after a month of effort. In early July, the Anyang City Labor Bureau and provincial and municipal trade unions organized a safety and hygiene inspection team to inspect various factories and mines. They also found the factory's safety and hygiene work to be relatively good. In terms of safety, the Hua'an Vegetable Oil Factory added wooden railings on both sides of the passageway from the first circular sieve to the second circular sieve, and railings were also installed on the footboards of the second circular sieve. In addition, railings were completely installed on all three passageways in the steaming machine workshop. Furthermore, all electrical wires in each workshop were equipped with trunking, and each light was individually fused with a switch. Regarding ventilation, each workshop was equipped with electric fans, small fans, and other ventilation equipment. In terms of hygiene, the dormitory added many washbasins, new wooden beds, and the air circulation was also improved. The canteen also added cabinets. The factory also has a supply of various medicines.

    I believe that as long as leading cadres pay attention to the safety and hygiene work of factories and mines and listen to the opinions of workers, safety and hygiene work can be improved. The Hua'an Vegetable Oil Factory is an example of this. Zhang Zemei

    华安植物油厂改进了安全卫生工作
    编辑同志：平原省安阳市地方国营华安植物油厂，由于领导干部重视改进安全卫生的工作，因而保证了职工安心生产。
    过去，这个厂的安全卫生工作也不好，工人们曾提出很多关于安全卫生工作的建议。由于这个厂的领导干部重视工人的意见，经一个月的努力，安全卫生工作有很大改进。七月初，安阳市劳动局和省、市工会组织了安全卫生检查组，到各厂、矿检查，也认为该厂安全卫生工作较好。华安植物油厂在安全方面，把头道圆筛到二道圆筛的过路板两边，加上木栏杆，在二道圆筛脚踏板上也装置了栏杆。并在蒸机车间的三道过路板上，完全安装了栏杆。另外，在各车间的电线上全部安装了槽板，每个电灯都是单保险带电门。在通风方面：各车间都安有电扇、小风扇等通风设备。在卫生方面：宿舍增设了好多脸盆，新木床，空气也很流畅。食堂也增加了柜橱。厂内并备有各种药品。
    我认为领导干部只要重视厂、矿安全卫生工作，听取工人意见，安全卫生工作是可以改进的。华安植物油厂就是一个例子。张泽梅
