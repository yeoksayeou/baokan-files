    China's Scientific Work in the Past Three Years
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

    I. The State of Science in China Before Liberation

    China is one of the earliest countries in the world to develop civilization. The Chinese nation once had glorious creations in science. However, due to long-term feudal oppression and the imperialist aggression of the past century, China's productive forces were hindered, making it impossible for China to establish its own large-scale industry, and agriculture stagnated in a primitive state, thus preventing science from developing. Imperialism ran hospitals and schools in China, and attracted foreign students, with the aim of creating intellectuals who would obey their interests and fool the broad masses of the Chinese people, let alone developing the Chinese people's own science. These characteristics of the old Chinese society determined the following characteristics of the old Chinese scientific work:

    First, the foundation was weak. Due to the backwardness of the mode of production, the natural sciences directly dependent on it lacked the foundation for development. The reactionaries relied on imperialism for survival, and imperialism only regarded China as a supply base for its raw materials and a market for its industrial products. Therefore, much scientific research in old China was merely an embellishment of the reactionary regime.

    Second, disorganized and unorganized. The reactionary rulers neither paid attention to the development of scientific undertakings, and the progress of scientific work was only based on the personal interests and efforts of the scientific workers. This made it impossible to rationally use the already insufficient manpower and material resources. For example, the former Academia Sinica and the former Peking Academy had many overlapping institutions, and their work did not coordinate with each other.

    Third, divorced from reality. Due to the backwardness of China's industry and agriculture and the reactionary rulers' lack of attention to scientific work, most scientists were forced to follow the path of research for the sake of research, according to their personal preferences, and were divorced from China's production reality. Such research was completely divorced from China's reality.

    Fourth, unbalanced development. This is particularly evident in the extremely unbalanced development of theoretical and applied sciences. For example, among the more than ten research institutes of the former Academia Sinica and the former Peking Academy, there was only one Institute of Engineering with insufficient manpower and material resources. Mathematical research, for instance, particularly developed combinatorial topology, with few people interested in mathematical analysis or applied mathematics.

    II. Changes in the Chinese Scientific Community After Liberation

    The victory of the great People's Liberation War smashed the domestic feudal and comprador forces and drove imperialism out of the Chinese mainland. The Chinese Communist Party and the newly established People's Democratic Government are leading the people in carrying out various reforms throughout the country. Chinese scientific workers are also transforming themselves, gradually forming an organized force.

    Most Chinese scientific workers studied in capitalist countries in the past, and under the reactionary rule, most had little contact with progressive ideas. After liberation, the Central People's Government correctly implemented Chairman Mao Zedong's policy of uniting and educating intellectuals. In the past three years, Chinese scientific workers have participated in various works and studies and received rich education. Many scholars, especially social science workers, participated in land reform work, while medical workers participated extensively in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Through participation in large-scale water conservancy projects such as the Huai River and Jingjiang flood diversion projects, scientific and technical workers have realized the importance of combining intellectuals with workers and peasants. Scientific workers who participated in the anti-bacterial warfare realized the extreme ferocity of US imperialism and how science was used by them to harm humanity. This year, under the call of Chairman Mao, many scientific workers participated in ideological remolding studies, criticized their past erroneous ideas, and initially consolidated the views of integrating theory with practice and serving the people.

    Chinese scientific workers deeply recognize the shortcomings of being disorganized and unorganized in the past. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, established in 1949, has developed into thirty-one research institutes covering various sciences in the past three years. In 1950, the National Congress of Natural Science Workers of China was convened, and the National Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies of China and the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization of China were established to unite and organize the vast number of scientific workers across the country. Social science workers have also organized the National Federation of Social Science Research Societies of China.

    Organized scientific workers have replaced the past scattered and isolated work with collective work. The establishment of the Joint Geological Survey Team in 1950 opened a new era in China's geological work. In 1951, the number of people participating in soil work in one district of Northeast China exceeded the total number of soil workers in the country before liberation. In the field of forestry, this year, professors and students from forestry schools in Northeast China, Hebei, and northern Jiangsu were mobilized to cooperate with soil scientists and botanists from various regions to investigate and measure the coastal windbreak forest belt from Andong through Shanhaiguan to the mouth of the Yangtze River. After the liberation of Tibet, scientific workers in natural and social sciences, under the leadership of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, organized a Tibet working team to go to the Tibetan Plateau, which scientific survey teams rarely reached in the past, and achieved remarkable results in various scientific works.

    Chinese scientific workers are working hard to learn from Soviet advanced science. In the great national construction work—such as railways, highways, water conservancy, and basic construction projects—Soviet experts are teaching Chinese workers, peasants, and scientific and technical workers with their outstanding and advanced knowledge. Advanced Soviet experiences are being promoted in industry, transportation, agriculture, and medicine: such as the Kovalev working method and high-speed cutting method in industry, "close planting" and "direct dry seeding of rice" in agriculture, and "tissue therapy" and "painless childbirth" in medicine. In terms of scientific theory, Chinese scientific workers are studying the doctrines of Michurin and Pavlov, introducing new developments in Soviet science, such as the theory of the origin of celestial bodies, the theory of the origin of life, and the criticism of idealism in quantum mechanics and the theory of resonance in chemistry.

    III. The Work and Achievements of Chinese Scientific Workers in Cooperating with National Construction in Various Aspects After Liberation

    If being divorced from reality and researching for the sake of research was the characteristic of scientific work in old China, then cooperating with various national construction projects is a characteristic of scientific work in new China.

    In terms of geology, through the deduction of geological structure theory and ore deposit theory and the confirmation of on-site drilling, the coal fields in Northeast China have been expanded tenfold, the reserves of a large iron mine in North China have increased tenfold compared with the initial estimate, and a large coal field in North China has been expanded sixfold.

    In terms of geography, in coordination with railway and water conservancy construction, new field survey data and reports were provided as references for railway alignment and engineering design. In terms of meteorology, in cooperation with the Central Meteorological Bureau, meteorological offices were set up in all major administrative regions of the country to do weather analysis and forecasting work, and a weather analysis center was established. New achievements have been made in long-term and short-term weather forecasts.

    In terms of biological sciences, a large number of bacteriologists, entomologists, and health and medical personnel participated in epidemic prevention work, limiting the harm of US bacterial warfare to a minimum. State-owned farms in various regions have applied advanced Soviet science and technology to increase the yields of crops such as cotton, wheat, and rice. Entomologists have found effective ways to control cotton aphids. Aquatic biologists have obtained effective methods for preventing and controlling fish plague and eliminating duckweed. Algologists have achieved preliminary success in artificially cultivating economic algae. Plant taxonomists and plant physiologists are engaged in the investigation and research of domestic rubber plants. Plant ecologists pointed out how to utilize the vast areas of acidic and saline-alkali soil in the motherland. Research on soybean rhizobia has isolated excellent strains that can increase soybean production by more than 10%. Research on fermentation bacteria has provided conditions for the development of the acetone-butanol industry and the flax industry. In terms of soil, investigations of wasteland in Northeast China, soil and water conservation investigations in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River, and soil improvement experiments have also been carried out.

    In terms of technical sciences, the successful trial production of ductile iron has opened up a new path for my country's engineering materials. The success of graphite beneficiation has improved the quality of natural graphite. The recovery of lean iron ore, silver sand beneficiation, and ferromolybdenum alloys have all been successful. In terms of building materials, soil cement and artificial panels have been created, saving a lot of wealth for national basic construction.

    In terms of physics, the research on permanent magnet steel has found methods to improve the smelting of domestic lead-nickel-cobalt magnetic alloys, which has been of great help to industrial production. The successful manufacturing of X-ray tubes and magnetic prospecting instruments will have a considerable impact on people's health and mineral exploration.

    In terms of chemistry, the research on potassium and aluminum salts of penicillin, penicillin and procaine composites, and arsenic dichloride has been successful. The manufacturing research of seed fungicides Ceresean and Guleisan has also been successful. The research on catalysts has played a certain role in the manufacture of sulfuric acid, the utilization of paraffin, and other chemical industries. Other researches such as petroleum research, pulp and papermaking research, artificial fiber research, carbon black research, Chinese medicine research, activated carbon research, refractory materials and chemical magnetic research have also yielded good results.

    Linguists have conducted research on modern grammatical structures, compiled a Concise Grammar of Chinese, and helped ethnic minorities to establish their own writing systems. Many working teams were also dispatched to conduct investigations and research on minority languages.

    Cooperating with various national construction projects is one of the most important tasks of scientific workers, but at the same time, research on scientific theory also receives due attention. In mathematics, the method of matrix geometry is used in linear group theory to solve the outstanding problems of linear group theory. In physics, various preparatory works required for the research of atomic nuclear physics have been completed. In chemistry, the success of the analysis of non-rotational rassecurfenol and its formic acid has solved a major problem left over in the structural chemistry and synthesis of aureomycin, laying the cornerstone for the stereochemistry of aureomycin. In geology, the study of the geology of the Taizihe area not only solved the local coalfield mining problem, but also revised the stratigraphic work of predecessors. The survey in western Hubei not only determined the stratigraphic position of iron ore, but also enriched the knowledge of the Paleozoic strata in China. Large-scale railway, highway, and water conservancy construction and excavation projects provide paleontologists and archaeologists with rich materials. A large number of dinosaur eggs were found in Laiyang, human fossils of the Paleolithic Age were discovered in the northwest, and Neolithic Age sites were discovered in many places across the country. The excavations in Anyang and Huixian provided new materials for the history of the Yin Dynasty slave society and the early Iron Age in China.

    Scientists enthusiastically participate in science popularization work. Under the leadership of the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization of China, more than 11,100 scientific lectures have been held, more than 4,500 scientific slideshows have been screened, and nearly 400 science exhibitions have been organized across the country in the past two years.

    In the past three years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, Chinese scientific workers have only just begun to exert their abilities. Our country is about to carry out larger-scale national construction, and our Chinese scientific workers should work with greater efforts to make scientific work serve national construction. To do this, first of all, we must arm ourselves with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, secondly, we must study the advanced science of the Soviet Union well, and with the development of the construction of the motherland, we must build up the Chinese people's own scientific undertaking.

    三年来中国的科学工作
    中国科学院副院长  李四光
    一、解放前中国科学的状况
    中国是世界上文明发达最早的国家之一。中华民族在科学上曾经有过光辉的创造。但后来，由于长期的封建压迫，近百年来帝国主义的侵略，阻碍了中国生产力的发展，使中国不可能建立起来自己的大规模的工业，农业也停滞在原始的情况下，因而使科学得不到发展的条件。帝国主义在中国办医院、办学校，吸引留学生，其目的在于造就服从于它们的利益的知识分子，愚弄广大的中国人民，更谈不到发展中国人民自己的科学。旧中国社会的这些特质，规定了旧中国科学工作的下列特点：
    第一，基础薄弱。由于生产方式的落后，直接依赖于它的自然科学就没有了发展的基础。反动派依靠帝国主义而生存，帝国主义只以中国为其原料供给地和工业品推销的市场，因而许多科学研究在旧中国只不过是反动政权的点缀品。
    第二，散漫无组织。反动统治者既不能注意科学事业的发展，科学工作的进行只是依据科学工作者们个人的兴趣与努力。使原已十分不足的人力物力不能合理的使用。例如前中央研究院与前北平研究院便有很多互相重复的机构，工作不相配合。
    第三，脱离实际。由于中国工业与农业的落后，反动统治者不重视科学工作，便迫使大多数科学家根据个人好恶，走上了为研究而研究的道路，脱离了中国的生产实际。这样的研究便完全脱离了中国的现实。
    第四，发展的不平衡。特别表现在理论科学与应用科学两方面的发展极不平衡。例如前中央研究院与前北平研究院的十余个研究所中，只有一个人力物力都不充足的工学研究所。他如数学研究便特别发展了组合拓扑学，对数学分析、应用数学也少人问津。
    二、解放后中国科学界的变化
    伟大的人民解放战争的胜利打垮了国内的封建、买办势力，从中国大陆国土上赶走了帝国主义。中国共产党与新建立的人民民主政权，领导着人民在全国范围进行种种改革。中国的科学工作者也在改造着自己，逐渐形成为有组织的力量。
    中国科学工作者多数过去是在资本主义国家学习，在反动统治之下，大多数很少接触过进步思想。解放后，中央人民政府正确地执行了毛泽东主席的团结教育知识分子的政策，三年来，中国科学工作者参加了各种工作和学习，获得了丰富的教育。很多学者特别是社会科学工作者参加了土地改革工作，医务工作者则大量地参加抗美援朝工作。通过参加治淮和荆江分洪工程这样大规模的水利工作，科学技术工作者们认识到知识分子与工农兵相结合的重要。参加反细菌战的科学工作者认识到了美帝国主义的穷凶极恶，及科学如何被它们利用来残害人类。今年，在毛主席号召之下，许多科学工作者参加了思想改造学习，批判了自己过去的种种错误思想，初步巩固了理论联系实际和为人民服务的观点。
    中国科学工作者深深认识到以往散漫无组织的缺点。一九四九年成立的中国科学院，三年来，已经发展了包括各门科学的三十一个研究所。一九五○年召开了中华全国自然科学工作者代表会议，成立了中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会和中华全国科学技术普及协会，把全国广大的科学工作者团结组织起来。社会科学工作者也组织了中华全国社会科学研究会联合会。
    组织起来的科学工作者以集体工作代替了过去的散漫孤立的工作。一九五○年地质联合调查队的成立开了中国地质工作的新纪元。一九五一年在东北一个区参加土壤工作的人就超过了解放前全国土壤工作人员的总数。在林业方面，今年动员了东北、河北和苏北各地森林学校的教授和学生们配合着各地的土壤学家和植物学家们调查和测量了从安东经山海关到长江口的沿海防风林带。西藏解放后，自然科学与社会科学各方面的科学工作者在政务院文化教育委员会的领导下组织了西藏工作队，去到过去科学调查队很少到达过的西藏高原，在各方面的科学工作上获得了显著的成绩。
    中国科学工作者正在努力学习苏联先进科学。在伟大的国家建设工作——如铁路、公路、水利、基本建设的工程中，苏联专家都以他们的卓越先进知识教导中国工人、农民、和科学技术工作者。工业、交通、农业、医学上，都在推行着苏联的先进经验：如工业的郭瓦廖夫工作法、高速切削法，农业的“密植”和“水稻旱直播”，医学的“组织疗法”与“无痛分娩法”等。在科学理论方面，中国科学工作者正在学习着米邱林、巴甫洛夫等学说，介绍了苏联科学的新发展，如天体起源学说，生命起源学说，对量子力学中唯心论及化学中共振论的批判等。
    三、中国科学工作者解放后配合国家各项建设方面的工作与成绩
    如果说脱离实际、为研究而研究是旧中国科学工作的特色，那末配合国家各项建设则是新中国科学工作的一个特征。
    地质方面，运用地质构造理论、矿床理论的推演及现场钻探的证实，将东北煤田扩大了十倍，华北一个大铁矿的矿储量较最初估计增加了十倍，把华北一个大煤田扩大了六倍。
    在地理方面，配合铁路和水利建设，提供了新的实地调查的资料和报告，作为铁道选线及工程设计的参考。气象方面，和中央气象局合作在全国各大行政区都设了气象处，做了天气分析和预报工作，建立了天气分析中心。在气象的长期预告和短期的预告方面都有了新的成就。
    生物科学方面，广大的细菌学家、昆虫学家、以及卫生医药人员，参加了防疫工作，把美国细菌战的毒害限制到极小的限度。各地国营农场应用了苏联先进科学技术，提高了棉花、小麦、水稻等作物的产量。昆虫学者对于防治棉蚜虫寻得了有效办法。水生生物学者得到了有效防治鱼瘟和消灭湖靛的方法。海藻学者用人工培养经济海藻获得初步成功。植物分类学和植物生理学者从事调查和研究国产橡胶植物。植物生态学者指出如何利用祖国广大面积的酸土和盐碱土。大豆根瘤菌的研究已分离出优良菌种，可使大豆增产百分之十以上。发酵菌的研究，给丙酮丁醇工业及亚麻工业提供了发展的条件。土壤方面，也进行了东北区荒地调查、淮河中上游水土保持调查、土壤的改良试验等工作。
    技术科学方面，球墨铸铁的试制成功，为我国工程材料开辟了一条新道路。石墨选矿的成功提高了天然石墨的质量。贫铁矿复选，银砂选矿及钼铁合金都已获得成功。在建筑材料方面，创造了土壤水泥及人造板给国家基本建设节省大量财富。
    物理学方面，永磁钢的研究找出改进国产铅镍钴磁性合金的制炼方法，对工业生产的帮助很大。X射线管及磁力探矿仪的制造成功，对人民卫生事业和矿产探测都将发生相当的作用。
    化学方面，研究配尼西林钾盐及铝盐、配尼西林与普罗卡因合成品及二氯化砷均已成功。种子杀菌剂西力生及谷乐生的制造研究也已成功。催化剂的研究，对于硫酸的制造石腊的利用及其他化学工业都已起了一定的作用。其他如石油的研究，纸浆及造纸的研究、人造纤维的研究、炭黑的研究、中药的研究、活性炭的研究、耐火材料及化学磁的研究，也都获得了良好的结果。
    语言学者进行了近代语法结构的研究，编辑了汉语语法简编，并帮助少数民族着手建立自己的文字。并派遣了许多工作队进行少数民族语言的调查研究。
    配合国家各项建设是科学工作者的最重要任务之一，但同时科学理论的研究也得到应有的重视。数学方面，在线性群论中运用矩阵几何学的方法，解决了线性群论的未决问题。物理方面，完成了研究原子核物理所需的各种准备工作。化学方面，无旋性雷斯屈酚和它的甲酸之分析的成功，解决了橘霉素构造化学和合成方面所遗留的一个大问题，给橘霉素的立体化学奠定了基石。地质方面，太子河区地质的研究不仅解决了当地煤田开采问题，且修正了前人的地层工作。湖北西部的调查除确定了铁矿层位外，也丰富了中国古生代地层的知识。大规模的铁路、公路、水利的建设及掘土工程，提供古生物学家和考古学家以丰富的材料。在莱阳寻获了大批恐龙蛋、西北发现了旧石器时代人类化石，在全国很多地方发现了新石器时代遗址。安阳和辉县的发掘对于殷代奴隶社会及中国铁器时代初期的历史提供了新材料。
    科学家热情的参加科学普及工作，在中华全国科学技术普及协会领导下，两年来全国各地举行了一万一千一百余次科学讲演，放映了四千五百余次科学内容的幻灯片，组织了近四百次的科学展览。
    三年来，中国科学工作者在中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，不过只是刚刚开始发挥出他们的能力。我们的国家即将进行更大规模的国家建设，我们中国科学工作者应该以更大的努力来从事工作，使科学工作为国家建设服务。而要做到这一点，首先就要用马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想来武装自己，其次要很好地学习苏联的先进科学，而随着祖国建设的发展，一定要把中国人民自己的科学事业建设起来。（新华社）
