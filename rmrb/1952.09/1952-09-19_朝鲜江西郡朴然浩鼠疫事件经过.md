The Korean farmers Park Ran-ho, Song Chang-won, and Choi Yong-seo from a village in Jiangxi County, South Pyongan Province, heard an American plane flying low and circling over their location around 4:00 AM on March 25, 1952. However, it did not strafe or drop bombs. Around 6:00 AM that morning, Park Ran-ho went to wash his face at a well about 80 meters northeast of his house and saw many fleas floating on the surface of the water in a one-meter-high water tank four meters east of the well. He had filled the water tank the previous night. Park Ran-ho's neighbor, Song Chang-won, also saw the fleas. They immediately reported this to the village epidemic prevention committee. The local epidemic prevention team then sent people to take out twenty fleas from the water tank and send them to the epidemic prevention station for testing.

At 9:00 AM on April 2, Park Ran-ho fell ill with a headache, chills, and a high fever. He died at 11:30 PM on April 4.

Looking at the history of the deceased, Park Ran-ho, he was healthy and had only suffered from malaria once in the summer of 1951. He received a quadruple vaccine injection for cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, and dysentery on March 12, 1952. He grew up in his native place and had not traveled outside. No guests had stayed in his house within a month before he fell ill.

According to statistics from the Jiangxi County Health Section: from January 1 to April 1, 1952, there were only a few cases of relapsing fever, diphtheria, and measles in the county; there were no other infectious diseases. Villagers living in the same village as Park Ran-ho also confirmed that there were no infectious diseases in the village. The report of Choi Heon-soo, the captain of the Korean Central Mobile Epidemic Prevention Team, pointed out that no plague bacillus was found in the rats captured in the village where Park Ran-ho lived after examination; no special changes were found after the autopsy of twenty-three rats.

After Park Ran-ho's death, Dr. Zhang Yuan-rong of the Korean Central Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Station performed an autopsy, and pathologist Dr. Nam Chang-chun's microscopic examination confirmed that his death was caused by bubonic plague. Bacteriologist Li Ru-gui conducted bacteriological tests on smears of Park Ran-ho's heart blood, lungs, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes and found that they contained Pasteurella pestis; bacteriological tests were also performed on the twenty fleas taken with sterile forceps from the water tank where Park Ran-ho was found to have fleas, and Pasteurella pestis was also found.

According to the information obtained by the International Scientific Committee, there has been no plague in Korea for the past five centuries. Furthermore, the fleas found in Jiangxi County were not rat fleas that could carry plague bacillus in their natural state, but human fleas. From many identifications and other materials, we know that this is the kind of human flea that Japan used in World War II.

The members of the International Scientific Committee examined the bacterial cultures isolated from Park Ran-ho's body by experts from Korea and China and were convinced that it was indeed plague bacillus.

The International Scientific Committee's conclusion on the Park Ran-ho incident is: "The US Air Force in Korea used methods very similar, if not exactly the same, to those used by Japan in World War II to spread the plague."

Due to timely sanitary measures in Jiangxi County, the spread of the plague sown by the American aggressors was successfully prevented.

    朝鲜江西郡朴然浩鼠疫事件经过
    平安南道江西郡某上村农民朴然浩、宋昌源、崔龙西等，于一九五二年三月二十五日清晨四时左右听见有美机一架在该地上空低飞盘旋，但并未扫射或投弹。当天早上六时左右朴然浩到离家东北约八十公尺处的水井上洗脸，看见井东四公尺处的一公尺高的水缸水面上浮着许多跳蚤。水缸里的水是他前夜灌满的。朴然浩的邻居宋昌源也看到了这些跳蚤。他们当即向村防疫委员会报告。当地防疫队随即派人从水缸中夹出跳蚤二十只送防疫站检验。
    四月二日上午九时朴然浩卧病，头痛、寒战、发高热。四日下午十一时三十分死亡。
    从死者朴然浩的历史来看，他身体健康，仅一九五一年夏曾一度患疟疾，一九五二年三月十二日接受霍乱、伤寒、副伤寒、痢疾四联疫苗注射。他在原籍生长，未曾出外旅行，发病前一月内也没有客人在他家里住过。
    根据江西郡卫生科的统计：从一九五二年一月一日至四月一日，在该郡只有过几例回归热，白喉和麻疹；没有其他传染病。与朴然浩同居一村的村民也证实该村没有传染病。朝鲜中央流动防疫队队长崔宪洙的报告指出：在朴然浩住的村子捕捉到的老鼠，经检查没有发现鼠疫杆菌；尸检了二十三只老鼠，也没有发现特殊变化。
    朴然浩死后，经朝鲜中央防疫检验站张元荣医师解剖和病理学家南昌春医师的镜检，证实他的死因是腺鼠疫。细菌学家李如圭以朴然浩的心血、肺、肝、脾及淋巴节的涂片进行细菌学检验，发现含有巴氏鼠疫杆菌；用无菌镊子从朴然浩所发现的那个水缸中夹出的跳蚤二十只，做细菌学检验，也发现巴氏鼠疫杆菌。
    根据国际科学委员会获得的资料证明：在过去五个世纪里，朝鲜不曾有过鼠疫。再则，在江西郡所发现的跳蚤不是在自然状态中能带鼠疫杆菌的鼠蚤，而是人蚤。从许多鉴定和其他材料中，我们知道日本在第二次世界大战中所用过的，也就是这种人蚤。
    国际科学委员会的委员们曾检查了由朝鲜及中国的专家自朴然浩体内分离出来的细菌培养，深信这确实是鼠疫杆菌。
    国际科学委员会对朴然浩事件的结论是：“美国空军在朝鲜应用了和日本在第二次世界大战中用以撒布鼠疫很相似的方法，如果不是完全一样的话。”
    美国侵略者在江西郡所撒布的鼠疫，由于该地及时的卫生措施，胜利地阻止了这一疫病的蔓延。 （新华社）
