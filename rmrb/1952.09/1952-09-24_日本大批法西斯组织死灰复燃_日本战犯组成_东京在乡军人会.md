Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd, Tokyo Dispatch: According to Kyodo News, "Right-wing elements that had once disappeared have resurfaced," and "reactionary groups advocating rearmament have begun to operate again."

According to investigations by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, there are approximately 400 such militarist and fascist groups and organizations throughout Japan, with 84 in Tokyo alone. Because these groups do not need to register after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, "it is difficult to know the actual number."

According to Kyodo News: Among these groups is the "Martyred Youth Corps," whose members recently assaulted Japanese peace representatives at the Japanese Foreign Ministry who were requesting passports to China. This organization is a branch of the notorious "Black Dragon Society," led by Toyama Hidezo, the son of Toyama Mitsuru, the head of the "Black Dragon Society." There is also the "Independent Youth Party" led by Wataru Shimizu and the "Greater Japan Youth Party" led by Bin Akao, etc. Kyodo News said: they all "advocate neo-Nazism, and promote extreme nationalism and imperial way ideology."

At the same time, many former Japanese fascist military groups that strongly advocate rearmament are also active. Former Army Colonel Tsuji Masanobu and others openly organized the "Greater East Asia League" under the banner of the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." In addition, the "Kaikosha," composed of graduates of the former Army Military Academy, and the "Koukai," composed of all graduates of the former Naval Academy, were established at the end of August.

Xinhua News Agency, September 21st, Tokyo Dispatch: On the eve of the Japanese general election, Japanese fascist military groups are openly resuming activities.

Fifty former Japanese military leaders residing in the Tokyo area announced the establishment of the "Tokyo Veterans Association" on the 18th. According to the United Press, the establishment of this organization is the first step in restoring the wartime national Japanese veterans organization, the "Japan Veterans Association," which was an important link in the aggressive military machine of Japanese militarism. A spokesman for the "Tokyo Veterans Association" also frankly admitted that the leaders of the association hope to establish a national veterans organization by the end of this year.

The leaders of the "Tokyo Veterans Association" are all notorious Japanese war criminals. The chairman of the association, former Lieutenant General Ando Kisaburo, served as the vice president of the Japanese fascist political organization "Imperial Rule Assistance Association" and the Minister of Home Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet during the war, actively planning the Japanese war of aggression at the time. The United Press also revealed that Kazushige Ugaki, who had long served as Minister of the Army and Governor-General of Korea, is also an important figure in the "Tokyo Veterans Association." As everyone knows, Ugaki Kazushige has been actively engaged in activities to revive the forces of Japanese militarism behind the scenes after the war.

The superficial work of the "Tokyo Veterans Association" is the so-called "striving for allowances for veterans," etc., but the United Press admits that the purpose of the former Japanese military leaders in establishing this organization is to "cover up their actual activities." It goes without saying that their activities are inseparable from the remilitarization of Japan.

### 日本大批法西斯组织死灰复燃  日本战犯组成“东京在乡军人会”

    日本大批法西斯组织死灰复燃
    日本战犯组成“东京在乡军人会”
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：据共同社透露，一度“销声匿迹的右翼分子又死灰复燃”，
    “倒行逆施倡导重整军备的右翼团体又开始活动起来了”。
    据东京警视厅的调查，这种军国主义法西斯团体和组织在日本全国约有四百个，仅东京一地，就有八十四个。因为在旧金山和约生效以后这类团体可以不必登记，“因此很难得知实际的数字”。
    据共同社透露：这些团体中，有“殉国青年队”，它的队员日前曾在日本外务省殴打要求发给来中国护照的日本和平代表。这个组织是劣迹昭彰的“黑龙会”的支脉，以“黑龙会”的头子头山满的儿子头山秀藏为首。此外有以清水亘为首的“独立青年党”以及以赤尾敏为首的“大日本青年党”等等。共同社说：他们都“主张新纳粹主义，标榜着极端国家主义和皇道主义”。
    同时，许多力主重整军备的旧日本法西斯军人集团，也在进行活动。前陆军大佐辻政信等人就公然以所谓“大东亚共荣”为口号组织了“大东亚联盟”。此外，在八月底还成立了网罗前陆军士官学校毕业生的“偕行会”和前海军学校全体毕业生的“交会”等。
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：在日本大选前夕，日本法西斯军人集团已在公开重新活动。
    居住在东京地区的前日本军事领袖五十人，在十八日宣布成立“东京在乡军人会”。合众社透露，成立这个组织是恢复战时全国性的日本退伍军人组织“日本在乡军人会”的第一步，“日本在乡军人会”曾经是日本军国主义的侵略军事机器的一个重要环节。“东京在乡军人会”的发言人也率直承认：该会首脑人物希望在今年年底能成立一个全国性的退伍军人组织。
        “东京在乡军人会”的首脑人物都是罪行昭彰的日本战犯。该会会长、前陆军中将安藤纪三郎战时曾任日本法西斯政治组织“大政翼赞会”副总裁和东条内阁的内务相，积极策划过当时的日本侵略战争。合众社并透露，曾经长期担任陆相和朝鲜总督的宇垣一成，也是“东京在乡军人会”的重要人物。大家知道，宇垣一成在战后始终在幕后积极从事复活日本军国主义势力的活动。
    “东京在乡军人会”在表面上的工作是所谓“争取退伍军人的津贴”等等，但是，合众社承认，前日军首脑成立这个组织的目的是为了“掩饰他们的实际活动”，不言而喻，他们的活动是与使日本重新军国主义化分不开的。
