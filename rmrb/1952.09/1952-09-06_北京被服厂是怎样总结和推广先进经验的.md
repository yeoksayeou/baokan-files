    How the Beijing Garment Factory Summarized and Promoted Advanced Experience
   　Wei Ruohui
    Recently, the Beijing Garment Factory used the Kovalev work method to summarize the work methods of two advanced workers in the factory, and promoted them, which rapidly increased the factory's production. After the workers learned the advanced work methods, the output generally increased by 50%, and the quality of products also generally improved.
    Before the "Three-Anti" movement, the Beijing Garment Factory had launched many production competitions and also learned the Kovalev work method last year. However, on the one hand, the leading cadres did not pay enough attention to this work and did not vigorously promote it among the workers. On the other hand, in the past, the factory always summarized advanced experience as: "Seize the time to work, run back and forth to the toilet; seize the time after work to prepare the work," etc. It never summarized the real skills and experience in technical operations. The workers spent a lot of effort but gained little when learning, so the promotion of advanced work methods often ended halfway. After the "Three-Anti" movement, the workers' class consciousness was unprecedentedly improved, and the bureaucracy of the leading cadres was also exposed and criticized, laying an ideological foundation for this learning and promotion of advanced experience.
    Cai Xiuzhi, chairman of the trade union of the first sewing department's workshop (班), thought of the work method of Xu Xun, a young worker who worked on the same section with her, after participating in the mobilization meeting of the factory trade union to learn advanced experience and find skills. She thought to herself: "Xu Xun is very relaxed when working, and his output is twice as high as mine, and the quality is also good, and there are fewer rejected products than mine. I seize the time to work, and I am very nervous when working, but I can't catch up with Xu Xun's output no matter how hard I try. There must be some skill here." So, she decided to see how Xu Xun was working. The main part of the work in Xu Xun's section is to sew the two sleeves and the body together. Because the interface (seam head) is curved, the average worker always has to stop the machine two or three times when sewing. When sewing to a place where they can't "turn", they realign the interface and then sew. But she found that Xu Xun did not stop the machine. Xu Xun's method is to wrinkle the sleeve bend on the body at the interface with his left hand before sewing, and release it at any time during sewing, releasing it where it is sewn. This allows him to sew to the end at once. This saves a lot of time, which is Xu Xun's skill.
    After Cai Xiuzhi discovered Xu Xun's skill, she immediately learned it herself. She completed each batch of work two hours earlier in less than three days of learning (from seventeen hours to fifteen hours). After that, she discussed with the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League in her class and decided to promote this method in her class first. During the learning and promotion of Xu Xun's advanced experience, the skill of another advanced worker, Liu Kuizhen, was discovered. Liu Kuizhen's work method is different from Xu Xun's, but the output is about the same as Xu Xun's, and sometimes even higher.
    When promoting Xu Xun's advanced experience in the class, most of the workers thought it was a skill and were willing to learn, but a few workers were not satisfied. Some workers thought: "This is nothing, just a different way of doing things." Others said: "His place is good, the machine is good, and he is young and strong." In response to this situation, the leading cadres used actual examples to educate everyone and promote everyone to learn. And it was decided to use the method of measuring the operation time to summarize the advanced experience of Xu and Liu. According to the measurement, the reason why Xu Xun's output was high and the quality was good was: the machine stopped less. Although Liu Kuizhen had to stop the machine several times in the middle of the machine's operation, his movements to pick up and place the work were fast, and the place to put the work was appropriate. Therefore, Liu Kuizhen could also do more work. Based on the measurement results, the trade union convened several symposiums to solicit the opinions of all workers and technicians. After such a summary and extensive solicitation of mass opinions, Xu and Liu's operation methods were recognized by the masses as advanced experience.
    After the above steps, the leading cadres decided to promote these experiences comprehensively in a step-by-step manner. First, they mobilized activists in the first sewing department to learn. After achieving certain results, they organized a small performance meeting with more than 30 participants. This performance meeting drove the workers in the fourth section to universally learn advanced experience. According to the learning situation, the leading cadres held several symposiums to listen to opinions from all parties. Under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, they organized the cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League and the technicians of the engineering department to actually understand and analyze the workers' movements on the spot, which further enriched the content of this new operation method. Finally, a factory-wide technical performance conference was held, promoting a climax of learning advanced experience and finding skills throughout the factory.
    In this promotion of advanced experience, we realized that: we must fully rely on the masses and promote advanced experience in a led and step-by-step manner. To promote advanced experience, we must break through a point, and promote the whole after achieving results and experience, so that people with conservative ideas can be educated in the face of facts. Using the form of performance meetings to promote advanced experience is one of the better ways.

    北京被服厂是怎样总结和推广先进经验的
   　魏如蕙
    北京被服厂最近用郭瓦廖夫工作方法，总结了本厂两个先进工人的工作法，又加以推广，使全厂生产迅速提高。工人学习先进工作法后，产量一般的增加了百分之五十，产品质量也普遍提高了。
    在“三反”运动以前，北京被服厂曾经展开过很多次的生产竞赛运动，去年也曾学过郭瓦廖夫工作方法。但一方面因为领导干部对这一工作重视不够，没有在职工中大力进行宣传，另一方面是过去厂里总结先进经验，老是总结为：“上班抓紧时间，上厕所来回跑；下班也抓紧时间把活定好”等等，从来没有总结出真正技术操作上的窍门和经验，工人们学习时费力不讨好，因而推广先进工作法时，往往半途而废。“三反”运动后，职工的阶级觉悟空前提高，领导干部的官僚主义也受到了揭发和批判，为这次学习和推广先进经验打下了思想基础。
    第一缝纫部车间（班）工会主席蔡秀芝，在参加了厂工会学习先进经验、找窍门的动员会议后，就想到和她在一个工段上工作的青年工人徐勋的工作法。她心里想：“徐勋做活时很轻松，产量比自己高一倍，质量也好，退修品也比自己的少得多。自己工作时间抓得紧，做活时也很紧张，可是，怎样也赶不上徐勋的产量，这里面一定有窍门。”于是，她就决定去看徐勋是怎样做活的。徐勋所在工段工作的主要部分，是把两个袖子和大身缝起来，因为接口（缝头）的地方是弯的，所以一般工人在缝制时总要停两、三次机器，缝到“拐”不过去了的地方，就把接口重新对齐了再缝。但是她发现徐勋却不停机器。徐勋的作法是在缝制前用左手把大身上的袖弯，在接口的地方一皱一皱地摺起来，缝制时随时放手，缝到那里，放到那里，这样就可以一下缝到底。这样便可节省很多时间，这也就是徐勋的窍门。
    蔡秀芝发现了徐勋的窍门后，自己就马上学习。她学习不到三天，每拨活便提前二小时完成（从十七小时缩短为十五小时）。其后，她就和本班的党、行政、工会、青年团研究，决定首先在本班推广这个方法。在学习和推广徐勋的先进经验时，又发现了另一先进工作者刘奎振的窍门。刘奎振的工作法和徐勋的不一样，但产量和徐勋差不多，有时候还要高一些。
    在本班推广徐勋先进经验时，大多数工人都认为是窍门，愿意学习，但也有少数工人不满意。有的工人认为：“这算不了什么，只是作法不同。”也有人说：“他的地方好，机器好，年青力壮。”针对这一情况，领导干部便用实际事例来教育大家，推动大家学习。并决定用测定操作时间的方法来总结徐、刘二人的先进经验。根据测定，徐勋产量高、质量好的原因是：机器停得少。刘奎振在机器开动中间虽然要停几次机器，但是他拿活的动作快，放活的地方合宜，因此，刘奎振同样可以多做活。根据测定的结果，工会又召集了几次座谈会，征求全体工人和技术人员的意见。经过这样的总结和广泛的征求群众的意见，徐、刘二人的操作方法便被群众公认为先进经验了。
    经过上述步骤以后，领导干部就决定有步骤地全面推广这些经验。首先在第一缝纫部发动了积极分子学习。在取得一定成绩后，又组织了三十余人参加的小型表演会，这个表演会带动了第四工段的工人普遍学习先进经验。根据学习的情况，领导干部又召开了几次座谈会，听取各方面的意见。在本厂党委的领导下，又组织了党、行政、工会、青年团的干部和工务科的技术人员到现场实际了解，分析工人的动作，这样就更丰富了这个新操作方法的内容。最后，举行了全厂性的技术表演大会，推动了全厂学习先进经验、找窍门的高潮。
    在这次推广先进经验工作中，我们体会到：必须充分依靠群众，有领导有步骤地推广先进经验。推广先进经验，必须突破一点，在取得成绩和经验后再推动全面，这样才能使有保守思想的人在事实面前受到教育。用表演会形式推广先进经验是较好的方式之一。
