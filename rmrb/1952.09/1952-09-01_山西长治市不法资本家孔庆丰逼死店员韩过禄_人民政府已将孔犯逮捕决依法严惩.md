    Shanxi Changzhi Ruthless Capitalist Kong Qingfeng Forces Shop Assistant Han Guolu to Death
    People's Government Arrests the Criminal Kong and Resolves to Punish Him According to Law
    Kong Qingfeng, the manager of Ruihua Photo Studio in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, who forced shop assistant Han Guolu, an activist in the "Five-Anti" struggle, to death, has been arrested by the judicial authorities and will be punished according to law.
    Before the "Five-Anti" movement, Kong Qingfeng had many illegal activities and exploited Han Guolu in various ways. According to half-year statistics, although Han Guolu spent money thirty-six times, the maximum amount each time did not exceed 10,000 yuan, and there were even two instances of 500 yuan. Whether to give money or not depended on whether Kong Qingfeng was happy or not. When Han Guolu was sick, Kong Qingfeng not only did not provide treatment, but even refused to let him eat. During the "Five-Anti" movement, Kong Qingfeng not only did not confess his illegal activities but also spread rumors to sabotage the movement. Han Guolu, out of public indignation, exposed Kong Qingfeng's illegal activities and actively participated in the "Five-Anti" movement. After the "Five-Anti" movement, Han Guolu's awareness improved. He studied hard at the workers and shop assistants' spare-time school and was able to diligently help others, and was elected as the study group leader. However, Kong Qingfeng even more intensified his exploitation and oppression of Han Guolu. In March of this year, Han Guolu's mother was seriously ill and needed to withdraw some wages to buy medicine. Kong Qingfeng scolded Han Guolu severely and deliberately tried to fire him from the shop. Soon, representatives attending the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce returned from Beijing and conveyed the direction and future of private economic development. Kong Qingfeng did not study the various documents of the conference well to reform himself. Instead, he deliberately distorted government policies and declared to Han Guolu: "As a manager, I have three major powers: personnel appointment and removal, capital allocation, and business management. You workers and shop assistants have none." Under Kong Qingfeng's coercion, Han Guolu was forced to hang himself. After the news of Han Guolu's death spread, the workers and shop assistants in Changzhi City were extremely angry. Within ten days, the Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions received joint accusations from nearly a thousand workers and shop assistants in twenty-seven private industries, unanimously demanding that the People's Government avenge Han Guolu and severely punish the illegal capitalist Kong Qingfeng. Fourteen public factories also protested the evil behavior of the illegal capitalist. Law-abiding industrialists and businessmen also submitted accusations, demanding that the People's Government severely punish Kong Qingfeng.
    The Changzhi Municipal People's Government accepted the opinions of the masses and decided to strictly deal with this kind of illegal capitalist who does not abide by the Common Program and continues to attack the working class after the "Five-Anti" movement. The Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Changzhi Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also used the Han Guolu incident to conduct universal education for the broad masses to further consolidate the achievements of the "Five-Anti" struggle.

    山西长治市不法资本家孔庆丰逼死店员韩过禄
    人民政府已将孔犯逮捕决依法严惩
    山西长治市瑞华照像馆经理孔庆丰，逼死“五反”斗争中积极分子店员韩过禄，已被司法机关逮捕，将依法惩办。
    “五反”运动以前，孔庆丰即有许多不法行为，并对韩过禄采用各种办法加以剥削。据半年的统计：韩过禄虽然用过三十六次钱，可是每次最多也没超过一万元，甚至还有五百元的两次。给不给钱，还要看孔庆丰高兴与否。韩过禄有病了，孔庆丰不仅不给治疗，连饭也不让吃。“五反”运动中，孔庆丰不但不坦白其不法行为，并造谣破坏运动。韩过禄激于公愤，揭发了孔庆丰的不法行为，并积极参加“五反”运动。“五反”运动以后韩过禄觉悟提高，在工人店员业余学校努力学习，并能勤恳地帮助别人，曾被选为学习班长。但是，孔庆丰也更变本加厉地剥削压迫韩过禄。今年三月，韩过禄母亲病重，要支些工资买药，孔庆丰把韩过禄大骂一顿，并处心积虑要把韩过禄开除出店。不久，出席中华全国工商业联合筹备代表会议的代表从北京回去，传达了私营经济发展的方向和前途。孔庆丰没有很好学习大会的各项文件以改造自己，反而故意歪曲政府政策，向韩过禄宣称：“我经理有人事任免、资金调拨、经营管理三大权，你工人店员一权也没有。”在孔庆丰的威逼下，韩过禄被迫上吊了。韩过禄被逼死的消息传出以后，长治市工人店员极为愤恨。十天内，市人民政府和市总工会即收到了二十七个私营行业，近千个工人和店员的联名控诉书，一致要求人民政府替韩过禄报仇，严惩不法资本家孔庆丰。十四个公营工厂也同声抗议不法资本家的罪恶行为。正当的守法的工商业者也纷纷递控诉书，要求人民政府严办孔庆丰。
    长治市人民政府接受群众意见，决定严格处置这种不遵守共同纲领、在“五反”运动后继续向工人阶级进攻的不法资本家。中共长治地委、中共长治市委也通过韩过禄事件向广大群众进行普遍的教育，以进一步巩固“五反”斗争的成果。
