Patriotic Health Work on the Inner Mongolian Grasslands
	Shi Haiyun

In the Patriotic Health Campaign, millions of model health workers have emerged. Sumiya, a Mongolian herdsman woman on the grasslands of Ulanqab League in Suiyuan, is one of them.

Sumiya is twenty-three years old this year. She started herding livestock for others at the age of seven. When she was fourteen, her parents sold her to a wealthy herdsman as a daughter-in-law because they couldn't afford to raise her. She only knew how to herd sheep and didn't know how to sew, so she suffered a lot of hardship and beatings. Because she had tasted the pain of the old society, the young Sumiya's face was a little haggard; but also because of her year-round labor, she was tempered to be as strong as steel. Her tall and sturdy figure, broad and dark cheeks, and heroic posture of wearing high-top riding boots and being good at riding horses, at first glance, make it difficult to guess that she is a woman, a woman from the grasslands who was once a shepherd.

After the liberation of the Ulanqab League grasslands, Sumiya, like other oppressed Mongolian herdsman women, saw the sun and turned over under the shining light of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's ethnic policies. She attended the Suiyuan Provincial Nationalities Cadre School. After a short three-month study, Sumiya made rapid progress in politics and culture. Last May, she returned to Darhan Banner, received a short period of health training, and was assigned to pastoral areas to carry out health work. At first, she encountered many difficulties in her work. Many elderly herdsmen said, "We have lived for so many years without paying attention to hygiene, and we can still live. We can still eat without washing pots and bowls." Individual Mongolian elderly women even said, "The more clothes are washed, the faster they will rot..." In response to this situation, Sumiya adopted the working method of "from the inside out" and "from old to young," and patiently carried out propaganda and education work. Sumiya first promoted the benefits of hygiene to her seventy-year-old uncle, Taimu Chaide, and then used him to promote it to others. At the beginning of the work, her uncle, like other herdsmen, said, "What's the point of paying attention to hygiene when you're old? You can still live without paying attention to hygiene!" Sumiya then used vivid examples to illustrate why hygiene was necessary. She said, "Aru Dema, who is forty-two years old, got sick because she didn't pay attention to hygiene and couldn't have children for thirteen years. Last year, the doctor came to cure her of venereal disease and stomach disease, and this year she gave birth to a boy. Since then, Aru Dema, who was pale and thin, has also become radiant." Sumiya's uncle and some elderly herdsmen who were listening felt that what she said made sense, and nodded frequently, expressing their acceptance of her opinion. An elderly Mongolian herdsman woman from the First Sumu (village) of the Second Nutuk (district) of Darhan Banner heard that Sumiya's uncle was also talking about hygiene, so she took the initiative to tell the herdsmen of the Second Group of the First Sumu about the harm she had suffered from not paying attention to hygiene. She said, "Last year, I was afraid of getting injections and hid in the mountains for two months, but I was sick for more than a month after I came back." When the health worker came to the village in April this year to promote vaccination, the old woman not only took the lead in getting vaccinated, but also called on others to get vaccinated. However, an elderly Mongolian herdsman woman, E'ergeer, from the Second Sumu (village) of the Second Nutuk (district) of the banner, questioned, "You can pay attention to hygiene when you are giving birth to children, but you can wear clothes without washing them! Why wash them? Won't they rot faster if you wash them?" Sumiya and another health worker, Erlin Qingsang, patiently explained the benefits of washing clothes, and personally washed the old woman's clothes. The old woman felt soft and light after wearing them, and was deeply moved, saying, "What the children said is right, I must pay attention to hygiene in the future." Now, the old woman E'ergeer not only washes her clothes once every ten days, but also cleans the yurt once a day.

In carrying out the Patriotic Health Campaign, Sumiya, in cooperation with the Provincial Health and Disease Prevention Team, traveled to every corner of the First and Second Nutuk (districts) of Darhan Banner, and cured a total of 409 male and female herdsmen and lamas suffering from venereal diseases. Through the joint efforts of Sumiya and the health team, a new look has emerged in the personal hygiene and environmental hygiene of herdsmen on the Ulanqab League grasslands: new well covers have been made on the wells, and newly placed wooden troughs have been set up to supply livestock with drinking water. The wells of herdsmen near Bailingmiao not only have well covers, but also have well houses built to protect the wells, and the doors of the well houses are locked every evening when the herdsmen do not use water. On the grasslands a hundred or so steps away behind each yurt, one can also see deep earthen pits—newly dug toilets for the herdsmen. After the feces are full, they shovel soil and bury them (people use cow and sheep manure as fuel on the grasslands, and human manure is useless). Stepping into the yurt gives people a refreshing feeling. Cow and sheep manure can no longer be seen on the felt beds where the herdsmen sleep (because people and livestock now live separately); on the wooden wide benches about a foot high on the front of the yurt, one can not only see clean painted small cabinets, but also colorful quilts and wool blankets (all newly purchased after liberation). The herdsmen are afraid that they will get damp and not last, so they take them out to dry in the sun every ten days to half a month. On the left side of the yurt, one can see not only the snow-white calico covering the tableware, but also the green gauze covering the enamel basins containing milk. Under the tableware, they also placed large and small floral enamel washbasins that they had never used before. Baode Xila, the reading group leader of Sishumuge Shao Village in Darhan Banner, told me, "After the Patriotic Health Campaign was launched this year, everything has changed on the grasslands. The milking buckets, which were often not washed in the past, are now not only washed with boiling water before milking, but also the milk is filtered with clean white cloth before making dairy food; it has become commonplace for herdsmen to use bowls and chopsticks when eating. Most of the young and middle-aged herdsmen have bought teacups and toothbrushes."

Through the Patriotic Health Campaign, maternal and child health work, which has not been valued on the grasslands for many years, has also been carried out. In the past, under the reactionary rule, exploitation, deception, propaganda, and feudal superstitious education of the Kuomintang, the broad masses of herdsmen never knew how to pay attention to hygiene. When they got sick, they always went to the temple to kowtow and pray to the gods; women did not even dare to tell others when their menstruation came. Many women still did heavy labor during their menstruation, and even traveled over mountains and rivers, which further increased the pain and diseases of Mongolian herdsman women. Many women did not dare to tell their parents-in-law and husbands when they were about to give birth, and even dared not give birth in the yurt, for fear of offending the "Buddha," which would be "inauspicious" for the rest of their lives. They often hid on the grasslands and in the mountains to raise their children. The herdsman Narbao said, "Before liberation, there were not many women who could give birth to children, and even if they gave birth to a few, they could not survive, and were all killed by 'four-six' wind." The old woman Damu Saileng gave birth to eleven children, and nine of them died. Many also died of arthritis, stomach disease, and typhoid fever. Among the more than 3,000 Mongolian men and women in the pastoral area of Darhan Banner, more than 2,000 had venereal diseases and stomach diseases. Among the 1,300 people treated last winter and this spring, as many as 1,198 had venereal diseases. Although 780 people have been completely cured, many herdsmen still believe that it is "God's will" for Mongolians on the grasslands to get sick. Sumiya and other health workers fought against these conservative and backward ideas. She used her own experience to illustrate the benefits of paying attention to hygiene. When distributing "menstrual belts," some women were shy and embarrassed to make them. Sumiya promoted to the women, "For the sake of our health, don't be afraid, what's there to be ashamed of!" At the same time, she used cloth to cut out the shape of "menstrual belts" for the women. After persuasion and mobilization, Qiqike and other poor herdsman women from Sishumuge Shao Village took the lead in using them.

As the Patriotic Health Campaign deepened, the women on the grasslands felt more and more that the old midwifery method was unhygienic, and they urgently demanded new midwifery methods. For example, Medegema, a herdsman woman who had dystocia and suffered from venereal disease and could not have children, initially said that she was sick, but then she was too shy to let the doctor see her. After Sumiya persuaded and mobilized her, she let the doctor cure her venereal disease last winter, and gave birth to a fat baby using the new midwifery method in May this year. Medegema was so happy that she couldn't close her mouth, and she told everyone about the benefits of women paying attention to hygiene and the new midwifery method. Under her influence and the call of the Banner People's Government, within two months, twelve Mongolian herdsman women out of the more than 120 pregnant herdsman women in the pastoral area of Darhan Banner gave birth to children in the Bailingmiao Health Center using the new midwifery method. Both adults and children were safe and sound. Therefore, the herdsmen on the Ulanqab League grasslands said in unison, "It's better to pay attention to hygiene!"

    内蒙草原上的爱国卫生工作
    师海云
    在爱国卫生运动中涌现出了千百万的卫生模范工作者。绥远乌兰察布盟草原上的蒙族牧民妇女苏米亚便是其中的一个。
    苏米亚今年二十三岁，他从七岁起便给人家放牲畜，十四岁那年她的爹娘因没法养活她，便把她卖给一家富裕的牧民做媳妇。她只会放羊，不会做针线活，因而受尽了磨难和毒打。由于饱尝了旧社会的痛苦，年青的苏米亚面容有些憔悴；但也由于终年劳动，她锻炼得如钢似铁一般的坚强，她那高大而又粗壮的个子，宽阔发黑的面颊，以及穿着长统马靴，善骑骏马的雄姿，乍看起来，使你很难猜想她是一位女子，是草原上一位牧童出身的妇女。
    乌兰察布盟草原解放后，苏米亚和其他被压迫的蒙族牧民妇女一样见到了太阳，在毛主席和共产党的民族政策光辉照耀下翻了身。她参加了绥远省民族干部学校，经过短短的三个月的学习，苏米亚在政治、文化各方面都有了飞跃的进步。去年五月她回到达尔罕旗，受了一个短时期的卫生训练，便被分配到牧区进行卫生工作。起初，她在工作中遇到不少困难，许多年老的牧民说：“我们多少年来没讲卫生也活出来了，不洗锅碗也能吃饭。”个别的蒙族牧民老太太还说：“衣服越洗越烂得快……”。针对这种情况，苏米亚便采取了“由里到外”“先老后少”的工作方法，苦口婆心地进行宣传教育工作。苏米亚首先向她七十多岁的舅父太木柴得宣传讲卫生的好处，通过他老人家再宣传别人。工作一开始，她舅父也和其他牧民一样，说：“年老了讲卫生干什么，不讲卫生也能活出来！”苏米亚便以生动事例说明了非讲卫生不可，她说：“四十二岁的阿儒得玛，因不讲卫生得了病，十三年不能生养，去年医生来给她治好了性病和胃病，今年便生下个男孩子，从此面黄肌瘦的阿儒得玛也红光满面了。”苏米亚的舅父和一些旁听的年老牧民感觉她的话有道理，才频频点了头，表示接受她的意见。达尔罕旗二努图克（区）一苏木（村）牧民老太太听说苏米亚舅父也讲起卫生，她便主动把她自己不讲卫生的害处向一苏木二组的牧民讲说了一遍，她说：“去年我害怕打针，到山沟躲了两个月，可是回来后却病了一个多月。”今年四月卫生员到村宣传种牛痘时，这位老太太不但带头先种，而且号召别人也种了牛痘。但该旗二努图克（区）二苏木（村）蒙族牧民老太太鄂里格尔又以质疑的口吻说：“生养孩子可以讲卫生，但衣服不洗也能穿啊！为甚洗它？越洗不是越烂得快吗？”苏米亚和另一个卫生员额林清桑耐心地一面解释洗衣的好处，一面就亲自动手给老太太洗了衣服，老太太穿上后感觉又软又轻快，因而深受感动地说：“孩子们说的对，以后我一定要讲卫生。”现在鄂里格尔老太太，不但每十天洗一次衣服，而且每天还打扫蒙古包一次。
    在开展爱国卫生运动中，苏米亚曾配合省卫生防治队，跑遍了达尔罕旗第一、二努图克（区）的每个角落，治好了患性病的男女牧民和喇嘛共四百零九名。经过苏米亚和卫生队的共同努力，乌盟草原上牧民个人卫生和环境卫生出现了新的面貌：水井上都做了崭新的井盖，还摆着新置的木槽，供应着牲畜的饮水。百灵庙附近牧民的水井上不但有了井盖子，而且还搭盖起保护水井的井房子，在每天傍晚牧民不用水时即将井房子的门锁起来。在每个蒙古包背后百十步远的草地上，还可以看到一个一个深深的土坑——牧民们新挖的厕所，在粪便满后，他们即铲土把它埋起来（草地上人们都用牛羊粪做燃料，人粪无用）。踏进蒙古包，使人有焕然一新的感觉。牧民睡的毡铺上，再也看不见牛羊粪便
    （因为人和牲畜已分开住了）；在蒙古包的正面尺许高的木制的宽板凳上，不但看到一个一个擦得洁净的油漆小柜，而且还会看到五颜六色的被褥和绒毯（都是解放后新购置的）。牧民们怕它们潮湿了不耐用，就每隔十天到半月拿到太阳下晒一次。在蒙古包的左侧，映进眼帘的不仅有遮盖饭具的雪白洋布，而且还有盖着盛奶子的洋磁盆的绿色纱布。在饭具下边他们还摆着从来没有用过的带花磁的大小洗脸盆。达尔罕旗四苏木格少村读报组长保德希拉对我说：“今年爱国卫生运动开展后，草地上到处变了样。过去常不冲洗的挤奶桶，如今不仅在挤奶前用开水冲洗一遍，而且在作奶食前还用洁白的细布把奶过滤一次；牧民们吃饭时用碗、筷，已成司空见惯的事了。青壮年男女牧民大多买了茶缸和牙刷。”
    通过爱国卫生运动，在草原上多年来不被人重视的妇婴卫生工作也开展起来了。过去广大牧民在国民党反动统治剥削、欺骗宣传和封建迷信的教育下，从来不知道讲卫生，有了病总是去庙里叩头求神；妇女们连自己的月经来了也不敢告人，不少妇女在月经期间还干着沉重的劳动，甚至跋山涉水，因而更增加了蒙族牧民妇女的痛苦和疾病。有不少妇女快要生孩子时，还不敢告诉自己的公婆和丈夫，更不敢在蒙古包里生养，怕冲了“佛爷”，一辈子不“吉利”。她们往往隐藏在草原上、山上养娃娃。牧民那尔保说：“解放前能生养孩子的妇女就不多，即使生下几个也活不成，全被‘四六’风抽死了”。搭木赛冷老太太生了十一个孩子，就抽死了九个。患关节炎、胃病、伤寒症致死的也很多。达尔罕旗牧业区三千多蒙族男女中，有二千多人有性病和胃病，去冬今春治疗的一千三百人中，患性病的即达一千一百九十八人，虽已彻底治好七百八十人，但尚有不少牧民认为草原上蒙民得病是“天意”，苏米亚便和其他卫生员向这些保守落后的思想作了斗争。她以亲身经验说明讲卫生的好处。在发动作“月经带”时，有些妇女害羞，不好意思做，苏米亚就一边向妇女们宣传说：“为了咱们身体健康，不要怕，羞什么！”一边便用布给妇女们剪“月经带”的样子，经过说服动员，四苏木格少村贫苦的牧民妇女奇齐克等首先采用了。
    爱国卫生运动越深入，草原上的妇女们越感到旧接生法的不卫生，她们迫切要求新法接生。如过去难产的牧民妇女梅得格玛，患着性病，不能生养，开始她说有病，后又害羞不敢让医生看，经过苏米亚说服动员，去冬让医生看好了性病，今年五月间即用新接生法生下一个胖娃娃。梅得格玛欢喜得连嘴也合不住，见人就宣传妇女讲卫生和新接生法的好处。在她的影响和旗人民政府的号召下，达尔罕旗牧业区怀孕的一百二十多个牧民妇女，不到两个月，已有十二个蒙族牧民妇女到百灵庙卫生院用新接生法生了孩子，大人小孩都安全无恙，因此，乌兰察布盟草原上的牧民们都异口同声地说：“还是讲卫生好！”
