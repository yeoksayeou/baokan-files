Czechoslovakia People Celebrate the Third Anniversary of the Founding of the People’s Republic of China
By Kě Bié Cí Jī, Minister of Propaganda and Culture of Czechoslovakia

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, it is a great honor for me to extend warm respects to you on behalf of all the people of Czechoslovakia from distant Czechoslovakia. I would like to associate this respect with the memories of our Czechoslovak government delegation's stay in the People's Republic of China from April to May 1952. Thanks to the hospitality of our Chinese friends, we were able to familiarize ourselves with China, a great country with thousands of years of culture, beautiful scenery, rich resources, and painstakingly built by hardworking and strong people; we saw with what loyalty and enthusiasm the Chinese people are building their new life, for which they had struggled for more than 30 years under the leadership of the victorious Chinese Communist Party and their great leader, Comrade Mao Zedong. On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we remember with deep admiration the leading figures of the new China of the people, with whom we had the opportunity to talk during our stay in China, and who made us Czech people sincerely admire them. We remember the male and female workers in the industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, where we witnessed the development of the construction activities of the Chinese working people and the achievements of the Chinese working class. We remember the Chinese farmers who personally told us of their gratitude to the Chinese People's Government, because this government gave them land and gave them the opportunity to live a new life. We remember the scientists, professors, lecturers, and male and female students who are raising their long-established Chinese civilization to a higher level in the universities and middle schools of the People's Republic of China, and are trying their best to make their great motherland more radiant and brilliant. We remember the Chinese cultural creators, writers, poets, composers, painters, drama and opera actors, and film workers, who are creating a new people's culture of China on the basis of the four-thousand-year-old Chinese culture. We remember the excellent Chinese youth and the lovely Chinese children. We remember the amiable Chinese people we met, who made us deeply believe that they love their motherland, love their newly won freedom, love their people's government, love the heroic Chinese Communist Party, sincerely love their leader—Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong, and believe that the Chinese people are grateful for all the help given to them by the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin.

    On this anniversary, I would like to say to you that the Czechoslovak people have learned more about Mao Zedong's victorious country from the reports of our Czechoslovak government delegation. The Czechoslovak people are closely watching the happy future of the People's Republic of China with sincere enthusiasm, and are closely watching the selfless assistance given by the Chinese People's Volunteers to the heroic struggle of the Korean people with a warm, shared spirit and extreme admiration. The crimes of the American aggressors who invaded the Korean and Chinese people have also ignited the fire of hatred for barbaric imperialism in the hearts of the Czechoslovak people. After the news of the achievements of the government delegation of the People's Republic of China in the negotiations in Moscow—the release of important documents aimed at maintaining and strengthening not only peace in the Far East and Asia, but also peace in the whole world—reached Czechoslovakia, the whole country was overjoyed. The Czechoslovak people also realize the great significance to world peace of the fact that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is being held in China. The Czechoslovak people, who are defending peace on the extreme western border of the world's progressive society, feel greatly encouraged to see the unbreakable peace front stretching from Prague to Guangzhou in the east.

    On the occasion of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Czechoslovak people express their wholehearted support for the friendship between Czechoslovakia and China.
    They will continue to strengthen the relations between our two countries with joy.
    Indeed, the Czech-Chinese Cultural Cooperation Agreement, Postal Agreement, Telecommunications Agreement, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement signed on May 6 in ancient Beijing have greatly increased this friendship. Thanks to the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the economic strength of our two countries has been increasingly strengthened, and the cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China in economic and trade relations has also gained more effective development opportunities. Chinese agricultural products, industrial products, semi-finished products, raw materials and other items are increasingly available in our Czechoslovak market. And the quantity of goods exported from our Czechoslovakia to China is also gradually increasing. The mutual benefit arising from the strengthening of the economic relations between Czechoslovakia and China can be clearly seen from the following fact: A large amount of Chinese iron ore is also being smelted in the new Czechoslovak blast furnace, so that we can produce more machines for export to China.
    Despite the great distance between the two countries, we also maintain contact in cultural aspects. We are extremely pleased that a Chinese Youth Art Troupe visited our Czechoslovak Republic this year, in addition to delegations of Chinese music, art, and film workers, and a delegation of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army visited our country this summer. We are pleased that our people's democratic Czechoslovak "Vite Nejedlý Army Art Troupe" was so warmly received in the People's Republic of China. In the future, we will further strive to develop the friendship between Czechoslovakia and China in all aspects, and will strengthen this friendship with the spirit of peace and our shared love for our common ally, the great Soviet Union and its genius leader, Comrade Stalin.

    While celebrating the glorious day of the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China—October 1—with the Chinese people, we express our sincere hope that the Chinese people will build their new life extremely smoothly, and that the People's Republic of China, this powerful force of the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp, will achieve the greatest development. On behalf of the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Gottwald, I hail: All glory to the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people's beloved leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.

    捷克斯洛伐克人民庆祝中华人民共和国建国三周年
    捷克斯洛伐克宣传与文化部部长  柯别茨基
    在中华人民共和国成立三周年之际，我能从遥远的捷克斯洛伐克，代表捷克斯洛伐克全体人民向你们致热烈的敬意，我认为这是莫大的荣幸。我愿把这种敬意与我们捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团在一九五二年四月至五月留在中华人民共和国那一段日子的记忆联系起来。感谢我们的中国友人的盛情款待，使我们得以熟悉中国这个伟大的国家，一个拥有数千年的文化、风景优美、资源富饶、由勤劳而坚强的人民艰辛缔造的国家；我们看到了中国人民正以怎样的忠诚热情来建设他们的新生活，他们曾在胜利的中国共产党和他们伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的领导下为这种新生活奋斗了三十多年之久。在中华人民共和国建国三周年之际，我们以深深的敬仰之情，怀念人民的新中国的领袖人物，我们在中国停留的时候曾有机会和他们交谈，他们使我们捷克斯洛伐克人民衷心钦佩。我们怀念我们所访问过的北京、上海、杭州、武汉和广州等地的那一些工商企业中的男女工人，我们在这些地方看到了中国劳动人民建设活动的发展以及中国工人阶级的成就。我们怀念中国农民，他们曾亲自告诉我们他们对中国人民政府的感激，因为这个政府使他们分得了土地并使他们有机会过新的生活。我们怀念那些科学家、教授、讲师和男女学生，他们正在中华人民共和国的大学和中学里面，把他们的久负盛誉的中国文明提到更高的水平，并且尽力使他们的伟大祖国更加光辉灿烂。我们怀念中国的文化创造者，作家、诗人、作曲家、画家、话剧和歌剧演员以及电影工作者等，他们正在四千年的中国文化的基础上创造中国的新的人民文化。我们怀念优秀的中国青年以及可爱的中国儿童。我们怀念我们所结识的和蔼可亲的中国人民，他们使我们深切地相信，他们热爱他们的祖国，热爱他们新近赢得的自由，热爱他们的人民政府，热爱英勇的中国共产党，衷心爱戴他们的领袖——中国共产党主席、中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席毛泽东同志，并且相信中国人民感激苏联和斯大林同志所给予他们的一切帮助。
    值此纪念日，我愿意对你们说，捷克斯洛伐克人民从我们捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的报告中，已经知道了更多的有关胜利的毛泽东的国家的事情，捷克斯洛伐克人民正以真挚的热忱密切注视中华人民共和国的幸福前途，并以热烈的、休戚与共的精神和极为钦敬的心情，密切注视中国人民志愿军对朝鲜人民的英勇斗争所给予的忘我援助。侵略朝中人民的美国侵略者的罪行，也使捷克斯洛伐克人民的心里燃起了仇恨野蛮帝国主义的怒火。关于中华人民共和国政府代表团在莫斯科谈判的成就——旨在不仅维护和加强远东和亚洲的和平而且要维护和加强全世界的和平的意义重大的文件发布的消息传到捷克斯洛伐克以后，全国各地莫不万分欣喜。捷克斯洛伐克人民也认识到：在中国境内举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议这个事实对于世界和平的重大意义。正在世界进步社会的极西的边陲上保卫和平的捷克斯洛伐克人民，看到坚不可破的和平阵线从布拉格起直至东方的广州这个事实，感到很大的鼓舞。
    当此中华人民共和国建国三周年之际，捷克斯洛伐克人民表示他们竭诚拥护捷中两国的友好。
    他们将满心欢喜地继续加强我们两国之间的关系。
    的确，五月六日在古老的北京签订的中捷文化合作协定、邮政协定、电信协定及科学与技术合作协定大大地增加了这种友好，由于苏联的忘我援助，使得我们两国的经济力量日益加强，而且也使得捷克斯洛伐克和中国在经济和贸易关系方面的合作获得了更加有效发展的机会。我们捷克斯洛伐克的市场上正在越来越多地得到了中国农业产品、工业产品、半制成品、原料和其他物品。而我们捷克斯洛伐克向中国出口的货物的数量也在逐渐地增加。由于加强了捷克斯洛伐克和中国的经济关系而产生的互惠情况可以从下面的事实中很清楚地看出：捷克斯洛伐克新鼓风炉中也在熔铸大量的中国铁矿，以便使我们得以生产更多的机器向中国出口了。
    尽管两国相距很远，但是我们两国在文化方面也保持接触。我们感到异常欣幸的是今年曾有一个中国青年文艺工作团来我们捷克斯洛伐克共和国访问，此外还有中国的音乐、艺术、电影工作者代表团来我国访问，而且今年夏天还有英勇的中国人民解放军的一个代表团来我国访问。我们感到高兴的是我们人民民主的捷克斯洛伐克“维特·尼耶德利军队文艺工作团”在中华人民共和国受到如此热烈的接待。我们今后将进一步竭力在各方面发展捷克斯洛伐克和中国之间的友谊，并将以和平的精神及我们对我们共同的盟国伟大的苏联和它的天才领袖斯大林同志所共具的热爱来加强这种友谊。
    在与中国人民一同庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年纪念日——十月一日——这个光荣的日子的同时，我们表示我们热烈希望中国人民异常顺利地建设他们的新生活，并且使中华人民共和国这支和平、民主和社会主义阵营的强大力量获得最大的发展。我代表捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统哥特瓦尔德领导下的捷克斯洛伐克人民欢呼：一切的光荣归于中华人民共和国和中国人民敬爱的领袖毛泽东同志。
