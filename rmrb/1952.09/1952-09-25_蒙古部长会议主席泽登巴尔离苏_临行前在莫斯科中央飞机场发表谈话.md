Stalin, for the warm hospitality and cordial care we have received during our stay in Moscow, and for the constant great assistance the Soviet people have given to the Mongolian people, and for the constant concern shown for the development of the Mongolian People's Republic.

We admire the great achievements of the great Soviet people in building communism, which are the fruits of their peaceful construction labor and prove to the whole world the peaceful aspirations of the Soviet people.

The Mongolian people are infinitely loyal to the great and unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet peoples. They believe that further consolidating this great friendship in every possible way will enable them to obtain a happy life and a brighter future.

The Mongolian people constantly feel the power of the ever-increasing economic and cultural cooperation between Mongolia and the Soviet Union and the benefits of this cooperation to our country. This cooperation, as well as the great and multifaceted assistance of the Soviet Union, is a strong guarantee for the Mongolian People's Republic to achieve new and greater achievements in its economic and cultural development.

The fraternal support and multifaceted economic and cultural assistance given to the Mongolian people by the Soviet people are the result of the Soviet Union's Stalinist policy of peace, the policy of equality for all countries, large and small, and the policy of fraternal assistance to the people of backward countries. This peaceful policy of the Soviet Union is supported by the peace-loving people of all countries, who believe that it is a policy that fully conforms to their vital interests.

The friendly relations between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples are unbreakable and permanent. The fraternal friendship between the peoples of the powerful Soviet Union, the great People's China, and the Mongolian People's Republic is also unbreakable and permanent.

No force can shake this great friendship between the peoples of our three countries, nor can it shake the fraternal and solid friendship between the peoples of all people's democratic countries and the people of the great Soviet Union, the reliable fortress of world peace.

Long live the eternal friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples!

Long live the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China, and the fraternal friendship between the peoples of all countries in the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism!

Long live the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy of defending and consolidating world peace!

Glory to the genius leader of the working people of the world, the best friend, father, and teacher of the Mongolian people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin!
