    Opening the "Union Medical College" Window to View the Motherland
    Lin Qiaozhi, Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology, China Union Medical College

    For the past thirty-odd years, I looked at the motherland from inside the "Union Medical College" window. The louder the sound of cannons, the tighter I closed the window. This time, what force made me consciously and willingly open the "Union Medical College" window and see our lovely motherland?

    In 1921, with youthful enthusiasm and the aspiration of "not striving to be a good prime minister, but striving to be a good doctor," as well as admiration for the "international standards" of "Union Medical College," I disregarded all difficulties, left my hometown of Fujian, and went north to Beijing, entering "Union Medical College" with great pride. Thirty years ago, a female student traveling from Xiamen to Beijing "Union Medical College" was no small feat. From the first day, I was afraid of not studying well and being dropped, so I studied to the point of exhaustion. I didn't study Chinese books at all, and I didn't write Chinese characters. My only goal was to pass the exams every year, graduate, and become a senior technician.

    After graduating in 1929, I stayed at the school to work. Under the "Union Medical College" system, coupled with my personal ambition for fame and fortune, I naturally embarked on the path arranged by American imperialism, worshiping American academia, admiring American "democracy," using American standards to measure everything, failing to see the greatness of the motherland, and gradually becoming detached from the masses. When the "July 7th Incident" broke out, many patriotic people abandoned everything and left Beijing to resist Japan. As for me, I insisted on continuing to work at "Union Medical College." "Union Medical College" was my only small world, my small country.

    On December 8, 1942, the Japanese invaders occupied "Union Medical College." I initially felt that personal life was inseparable from the country, tasted the bitterness of being a subjugated people during the period of occupation, and looked forward day and night to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War so that I could return to the embrace of the motherland. The news of victory came, and I was overjoyed and determined to serve the motherland with full enthusiasm. However, in a very short time, the corruption of the Kuomintang government extinguished all my patriotic enthusiasm, I completely lost confidence in this government, and I became disheartened and disappointed about the rejuvenation of the motherland.

    In 1948, I returned to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of "Union Medical College" to work, ignoring politics and focusing wholeheartedly on work and teaching.

    After liberation, I consistently adopted a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude toward the People's Government, believing that every government was the same, merely changing the facade. Anyway, politics was something for specialists to handle, and we who studied technology should simply stay far away. From a young age, I had listened to a lot of nonsense, such as the Communist Party killing, arson, and practicing communism of wives and property, etc. Coupled with my own pro-American and worship-American thinking, I accepted a lot of reactionary propaganda, such as saying that there was no freedom under the Communist Party, that every move was monitored, that there was only collective life and no individual life, no family, and no country, etc.

    However, from the "Union Medical College" window, I also saw that the People's Liberation Army was highly disciplined, had a high degree of patriotism, and could endure hardship and stand hard work; I saw that prices stabilized quickly, transportation rapidly recovered, construction was everywhere, and the people's cause continued to develop. From this series of facts, I began to realize that this government was different from the previous governments and was a government that worked for the people. My skeptical thinking about the People's Government began to change.

    During the Three-Anti Movement, serious corruption, waste, and bureaucracy were exposed in "Union Medical College," which made me begin to doubt the "Union Medical College standards." I originally didn't even have the most basic political understanding. I always used the excuse of being busy with work to avoid all major lectures and reports, and I was unwilling to participate in any political activities. The country's development was booming, and new things were emerging one after another, but I didn't care about it at all. It wasn't until the fact that nurses in the Obstetrics and Gynecology ward were giving empty injections was revealed that I became indignant. No matter how skilled the doctors were or how responsible they were to the patients, even if they made early and late rounds, wouldn't it all be in vain if the nurses were giving empty injections? I then realized that technology cannot be separated from politics.

    Therefore, I went from passively participating in learning to actively participating in the movement. At that time, I read a lot of documents and, combined with the facts, studied Chairman Mao's works. From "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" to "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Pay Attention to Methods of Work," not a single concept was divorced from the interests of the masses. I realized the greatness of the people's leader.

    On the basis of the victory of the Three-Anti Movement, the ideological remolding movement was launched. At the beginning, I still had concerns in my mind, thinking that making self-criticisms would be equivalent to purging the department director. With this kind of thinking, I adopted an antagonistic attitude toward the movement and refused to lower my head, so I was always uneasy and suspicious. After listening to Comrade Zhang Dazhong's report on policies, I learned that the ideological remolding movement was an "anti-imperialist patriotic" movement, a matter within our people, the purpose of which was to unite and transform, criticize old ideas, eliminate ideological poisoning, and the most important thing was to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. It seemed that it wasn't that serious. I didn't wear foreign clothes, and I even thought leather shoes were too heavy. My pro-American and worship-American thinking wasn't considered serious, so I felt relieved. At that time, I didn't have a sufficient understanding of my own problems, and I felt that self-criticism shouldn't be too difficult. At this time, my understanding of the cultural aggression of imperialism was still very vague. I always thought that the United States was a free country and admired its freedom. I thought that the United States was the most scientifically developed country in the world and the world's scientific center. I regarded the United States as a friend of China and thought that they were helping us, opening schools, running hospitals and medical schools, and promoting us. However, as the movement progressed and after careful ideological examination, I realized that it was difficult for me to separate myself from American imperialism and that my pro-American and worship-American thinking was serious. I realized that distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves was not an easy task.

    After learning, after the inspiration of accusation meetings and exhibitions, and the proof of facts, I deeply realized how American imperialism carried out cultural aggression conspiracies in "Union Medical College," and I understood that I had been deceived all these years. After visiting the exhibition of the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, I thoroughly realized the ambition of American imperialism to invade our country. The most inhumane bacteriological warfare completely exposed the true face of American imperialism and revealed the decay of capitalist countries. The struggle of the Chinese and Korean people against bacteriological warfare told me that science can truly serve the people only in countries where the people are in power.

    At the teacher-student forum, the students earnestly, caringly, and lovingly asked us teachers to stand on the people's position and be good teachers of the people. I felt the importance of the teacher's responsibility, and Chairman Mao loved us so much, trying every means to educate, transform, and win over our group of intellectuals, not sending us to revolutionary universities, but moving revolutionary universities to "Union Medical College." How could I not reform? I recalled that for the three years since liberation, I had been steadily not progressing. Now I want to move forward steadily.

    In the stage of launching criticism and self-criticism, I further realized the care of the People's Government for us. They very patiently helped our cadres, first understanding the situation of each of us, estimating the political level of each of us, enlightening our consciousness, and holding various forums to discuss, analyze, and study various opinions. I deeply realized that this method was realistic and scientific.

    Through the ideological remolding movement, I received a series of educations, fought against my own backward thinking, and further fought against reactionary thinking. I realized that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, any movement would surely be victorious in every battle. The main reason is that the Communist Party and the People's Government serve the people and use the interests of the people as the standard of measurement. The secret of victory is to enlighten the consciousness of the masses and rely on the strength of the masses. It was this truth that moved me, awakened me, and made me willingly abandon the "Union Medical College standards" that I had adhered to for many years, open the windows that had been closed tightly for more than thirty years, and stick my head out to "sing of our beloved motherland, marching towards prosperity and strength from now on..." I saw clearly that everything in the Soviet Union also starts from the interests of the people. Any undertaking is combined with the broad masses of the people, such as Pavlov's spiritual prophylaxis and painless childbirth, which are good examples. I am determined to learn from the Soviet Union and better serve the people, and seek happiness for the broad masses of the people.

    The "Union Medical College" window has been opened, the five-star red flag of the Mao Zedong era has been raised, and the staff of "Union Medical College" have all stood up. We are glorious and proud of the great progress of the motherland, and we welcome the National Day of the motherland and the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference with great enthusiasm. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I want to unite with all peace-loving people in the world and fight to defend world peace and the new generation.

### 打开“协和”窗户看祖国

    打开“协和”窗户看祖国
    中国协和医学院妇产科主任　林巧稚
    过去三十多年，我从“协和”窗内看祖国，炮声愈响，我把窗户关得愈紧。这一回，什么动力叫我自觉自愿地打开“协和”的窗户，看见了我们可爱的祖国呢？
    一九二一年我怀着青年的热情和“不为良相，当为良医”的愿望以及对“协和”的“国际标准”的羡慕，不顾一切的困难，离开家乡福建，到了北方，考进“协和”，很为得意。三十年前一个女学生从厦门到北京“协和”，不是一件小事。从第一天起，我就怕念不好书，被刷掉，所以死读书。我念的全不是中国书，写的不是中国字，唯一的目的就是要每年考试及格，毕了业，成为一个高级的技术家。
    一九二九年毕业后，留校工作。在“协和”的制度下，加上个人往上爬的求功名思想，我自然而然地走上美帝国主义安排好的道路，崇拜美国的学术，羡慕美国的“民主”，处处用美国的标准来衡量，看不见祖国的伟大，渐渐脱离了群众。“七七”事变爆发，多少爱国志士为了抗日抛弃一切，离开北京。我呢，坚持在“协和”继续工作，“协和”就是我的唯一的小世界，小国家。
    一九四二年十二月八日，日寇占领“协和”，我初步感觉到个人生活离不了国家，在沦陷时期尝到亡国奴的滋味，日夜盼望抗日胜利，可以回到祖国的怀抱里。胜利消息传来，欢欣鼓舞，满腔热情地决心为祖国服务。但在很短时间内，国民党政府的腐败，打消了我一切的爱国热情，对这个政府完全失掉信心，对祖国的复兴灰心失望。
    一九四八年回“协和”妇产科工作，对政治不闻不问，一心一意搞工作，教书。
    解放以后，我对人民政府一贯采取怀疑观望的态度，认为那一个政府都是一样的，换换门面而已。反正政治是有专门人干的，我们学技术的干脆离开远一点儿好。我从小听了一片胡说，什么共产党杀人放火，共妻共产等等，加上自己亲美崇美的思想，接受了好些反动宣传，例如说共产党没有自由，一举一动有人监视，只有集体生活没有个人生活，没有家庭没有国家等。
    但是，我从“协和”窗里也看到解放军纪律严明，有高度的爱国精神，能吃苦耐劳；看到短时间内物价平稳，交通迅速恢复，到处都在建设，人民事业不断发展。从这一连串的事实，我开始认识这个政府与从前的政府不同，是为人民作事的政府。我对人民政府怀疑的思想开始有了转变。
    在三反运动中，在“协和”揭露出严重的贪污、浪费和官僚主义，使我对“协和的标准”开始怀疑。我本来连起码的政治认识也没有，总是藉口工作忙，逃避所有的大课报告，任何政治活动，一律不愿参加。全国的发展蒸蒸日上，新的事物，日新月异，但我毫不关心，直到妇产科病房护士打空针的事实被揭发后，我才痛恨起来了。不管医生的技术如何高明，对病人如何负责，早看晚巡，然而护士打空针，那还不是白费劲吗？我才体会到技术脱离不了政治。
    因此我从被动的参加学习，到主动的参加运动，当时阅读了不少文件，结合事实，学习毛主席的著作。从“实践论”、“矛盾论”到“关心群众生活，注意工作方法”，没有一个观念脱离大众的利益，我体会到人民领袖的伟大。
    在三反运动胜利的基础上，展开了思想建设运动。在刚开始的时候，我思想上还存在着顾虑，认为要作检讨，不就等于整科主任吗？有了这样想法，我对运动就采取了对立的态度，不肯低头，因此处处心虚，怀疑。等到听了张大中同志报告政策后，我知道思想建设运动是“反帝爱国”运动，是我们人民内部的事，目的是团结改造，批判旧思想，肃清思想上的毒害，最要紧的是分清敌我。看来，并不厉害。我也不穿外国衣裳，穿皮鞋都嫌重，我的亲美崇美不算严重也就安心了。当时对自己的问题认识不够，觉得检讨不应该太难，这个时候对帝国主义的文化侵略认识还很模糊。我一向认为美国是自由的国家，羡慕它的自由，认为美国是世界上科学最发达的国家，是世界科学中心，把美国当作中国的朋友，以为他们帮助我们，替我们开学校，办医院、医学院，提拔我们。可是，在运动向前进行，经过细细思想检查，才理会我和美帝国主义很难分家及亲美崇美的严重程度，体会到划清敌我却不是一件容易事。
    经过学习，经过控诉会、展览会的启发和事实的证明，我才深刻地认识到美帝国主义在“协和”如何进行文化侵略的阴谋，明白了我这些年来一直受到蒙蔽。参观了美帝国主义在朝鲜及我国东北进行细菌战罪行展览会，我彻底认识了美帝国主义侵略我国的野心，最无人道的细菌战，完全暴露了美帝国主义的真象，显出了资本主义国家的腐朽。中朝人民反对细菌战的斗争告诉我：只有在人民当权的国家，科学才能真正为人民服务。
    在师生座谈会上，同学们以非常诚恳、关心、热爱的态度要求我们先生站在人民立场，作好人民教师。我感到教师责任的重大，而毛主席又那样爱护我们，想尽方法教育、改造、争取我们这一班知识分子，不是让我们去革命大学，而是把革命大学搬到“协和”来，我怎么能不改造呢？我回想解放三年来，我是稳步不进，现在我要稳步前进。
    在展开批评与自我批评的阶段，我更进一步地认识了人民政府对我们的关怀。非常耐心地帮助我们的干部，先了解我们每个人的情况，估计我们每个人的政治水平，启发我们的自觉，开各种座谈会，讨论、分析、研究各个意见。我深深体会到这种方式方法是实事求是的，是科学的。
    经过思想建设运动，我得到了一连串的教育，对自己落后思想做斗争，又进一步跟反动思想做斗争。我觉悟到在共产党与毛主席领导之下，任何运动必然百战百胜，其主要原因就是共产党与人民政府是为人民服务的，是以人民的利益做衡量的标准。胜利的秘方就是启发群众的觉悟，依靠群众的力量。就是这个真理感动了我，唤醒了我，使我甘心抛弃多年固守的“协和标准”，打开了三十多年关紧的窗户，伸出头去“歌唱我们亲爱的祖国，从今走向繁荣富强……”。我看清楚了苏联的一切，也都是以人民的利益做出发点的，任何一个事业，都是与广大人民相结合的，如巴甫洛夫的精神性预防、无痛分娩法，就是一个很好的例子。我决心向苏联学习，更好地为人民服务，为广大的人民谋幸福。
    “协和”的窗户打开了，竖起了毛泽东时代的五星红旗，“协和”的工作人员全都站起来了。我们为祖国伟大的进步感到光荣骄傲，以万分热烈的心情迎接祖国的国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的开幕。我要在共产党与毛主席领导下，同全世界爱好和平的人民团结在一起，为保卫世界和平与新的一代而奋斗。
