After the Publication of the Report by the International Scientific Commission, the US Government Can No Longer Deny its Guilt in Germ Warfare

(Xinhua News Agency, 20th) The conclusion by the "International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Germ Warfare in Korea and China" that American troops were conducting germ warfare has made the US government panic-stricken and restless. As a result, when only the "Preface" and "Conclusions" of the International Scientific Commission's report had been published, the US State Department hastily issued a statement on the evening of the 15th, falsely accusing the International Scientific Commission of presenting "false evidence."

One cannot help but wonder, since only the "Preface" and "Conclusions" of the International Scientific Commission's report have been published, in other words, many undeniable facts and evidence about the US military conducting germ warfare in Korea and China have yet to be made public. How could the US State Department openly claim that all the evidence presented by the International Scientific Commission was "false evidence"? The US State Department has not even glanced at many of the evidences provided by the International Scientific Commission, how can it openly say that they are "fabricated"? The panicked US State Department is attempting to overturn the irrefutable testimonies and material evidence that the International Scientific Commission is about to present with such arbitrary words. This only serves to expose the cowardly and guilty conscience of the US government.

In addition to empty slanders, the US State Department continues to shamelessly claim that the US government demands a "fair investigation" by "qualified individuals." According to the usual understanding, "qualified individuals" suitable for investigating the facts of germ warfare should be independent and impartial scientists, and a "fair investigation" should have a highly objective attitude and follow the strictest scientific principles in the investigation. The International Scientific Commission, composed of experts from six countries, is precisely a scientific organization composed of such qualified individuals, and their attitude during the investigation has been solemnly stated in the preface to the Commission's report. The US State Department obviously cannot produce any evidence to say that these experts are not qualified, nor does it have any evidence to say that their investigation, which lasted for more than two months, was unfair.

The US State Department was completely silent after the confessions of American Air Force prisoners of war, Kniss and O'Neill, were published, and after the full text of the International Scientific Commission's report was published. This shows that when abundant materials and conclusive evidence are completely presented before it, its glib tongue, which is good at sophistry, suddenly becomes twisted. The only option for the US government now is to instigate its kept newspapers to launch personal attacks on the members of the International Scientific Commission, saying that they are "fellow travelers of the Communists." But even if the US government is shameless to this extent, it does not dare to say that Kniss, O'Neill, Enok, and Quinn are "fellow travelers of the Communists," thereby overturning their confessions. The more the US government tries to avoid all this undeniable evidence that touches its sore spots, the more it exposes its bloody face as a germ warfare criminal before the world.

The US State Department admits that the US government is now "standing before the court of world opinion." The fair and objective investigation by the International Scientific Commission has indicted and convicted the US government, which barbarously conducts germ warfare, before the people of the world. This verdict cannot be overturned by any "denial," sophistry, or "Voice of America" style nonsense. Even the warmonger Dulles, who orchestrated the Korean War, publicly admitted on the 17th that a billion Asian people have fully realized that the United States is "not only militaristic, but also the most barbaric militarist, waging war against unarmed villages and women and children with bacteria, napalm bombs, and other terrible means." He said: "Most people in the world today think we have committed heinous atrocities." With ironclad evidence and heinous crimes, the germ warfare criminals now have nowhere to escape.

    国际科学委员会报告书发表后
    美国政府已无法抵赖进行细菌战的罪责
    【新华社二十日讯】“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”证实美国军队进行细菌战的结论，使得美国政府心惊肉跳，坐卧不安，以致美国国务院在国际科学委员会报告书还只发表了“序言”和“结论”两部分的时候，就仓忙在十五日晚上发表声明，空口诬蔑国际科学委员会所提出的都是“假证据”。
    人们不能不奇怪，既然国际科学委员会的报告书还只发表了“序言”和“结论”两部分，换句话说，关于美国军队在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的许多不容置辩的事实和证据都还有待公诸于世，美国国务院怎么就能公然说国际科学委员会提出的都是“假证据”呢？美国国务院对国际科学委员会所提供的许多证据连看都还没有看一眼，怎么就能公然说它们是“制造”出来的呢？着了慌的美国国务院企图用这种武断之词，来推翻国际科学委员会所将要提出的确凿无疑的人证和物证，这就欲盖弥彰地显出了美国政府贼胆心虚的丑态。
    美国国务院除了空洞的诬蔑外，继续赖着脸皮说：美国政府要求由“有资格人士”进行“公正调查”。按照通常的理解，适宜于调查细菌战事实的“有资格人士”应该就是独立的公正的科学家，而“公正调查”就是在调查中应该具有高度客观的态度，遵循最严格的科学原则。由六国专家组成的国际科学委员会，正是由这样的有资格人士所组成的科学团体，而他们在调查时所抱的态度也已经在委员会报告书的序言中郑重声明。美国国务院显然拿不出任何根据来说这些专家不是有资格人士，也没有任何根据说他们经过两个月之久的调查是不公正的。
    美国国务院在美国空军战俘克尼斯和奥尼尔的供词发表了以后，在国际科学委员会报告书全文发表了以后，却就完全哑口无言了。这说明当丰富的材料和确凿的证据完全摆在它的面前时，它的善于狡赖的如簧之舌也一下子转不过弯来了。美国政府现在唯一的办法是策动它的御用报纸对国际科学委员会的委员们进行人身攻击，说他们是“共产党的同路人”。但是美国政府即使无耻到这样，它也不敢说克尼斯、奥尼尔、伊纳克、奎恩是“共产党的同路人”，从而推翻他们的供词。美国政府愈是尽量避开所有这些触着它的痛处的不容置辩的证据，就愈是在全世界面前暴露了它的细菌战罪犯的血腥面目。
    美国国务院承认，美国政府现在已经“兀立在世界法庭舆论之前”了。国际科学委员会的公正而客观的调查，已经在世界人民面前检举了野蛮地进行细菌战的美国政府并作出了定案。这个定案不是任何“否认”、狡赖或者“美国之音”式的胡说八道所能推翻得了的，连一手导演侵略朝鲜的战争的战争贩子杜勒斯也在十七日公开承认，十亿亚洲人民已经充分认识到美国“不仅是军国主义者，而且是最野蛮的军国主义者，用细菌、汽油弹及其他可怕的手段对赤手空拳的村镇和妇孺进行战争”。他说：“世界上大部地区的人今天都以为我们干了十恶不赦的暴行。”铁证如山，罪恶滔天的细菌战争罪犯现在已经无路可逃了。
