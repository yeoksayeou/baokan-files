    The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government Conducts a Self-Criticism Regarding Errors in Treatment of Agricultural Technicians

    Editor: The criticism raised by ten comrades including Li Yulin in the People's Daily on July 9th concerning the "Suiyuan Provincial State-run Sa County Farm's practice of departmentalism in treating tractor drivers" is basically correct. We have conducted a detailed review.

    In 1951, when the State-run Sa County Farm decided to reduce the cultivated land area and downsize the staff due to poor soil quality, some tractor trainees and repair technicians were left over. Without consulting with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on how to handle this situation, we subjectively believed that transferring these personnel back to the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government would be "not easy," and thought: "Even if they are transferred back to the central government, it will be difficult to arrange appropriate positions for them." Therefore, we introduced some of these personnel to other departments in Suiyuan Province to work as car drivers, and introduced others to the Central Forestry Cadre School to study. This was an error caused by our weak organizational awareness and subjectivism. Furthermore, our starting point at the time was simply to "settle" these personnel, without considering the long-term interests of national economic construction, and lacking a sense of responsibility for training young cadres. The criticism from the ten comrades including Li Yulin has drawn our department's attention, making us deeply realize that the handling of these cadres was seriously flawed. In the future, we will learn from this lesson.

    绥远省人民政府农林厅检讨对待农业技术人员的错误
    编辑同志：人民日报七月九日登载李玉琳等十同志提出的“绥远省国营萨县农场以本位主义对待拖拉机手”的批评，基本上是正确的，我们已经详细检查。
    一九五一年，国营萨县农场因土质恶劣，决定缩小耕地面积、紧缩编制时，剩下了一部分拖拉机练习生和修理技士。我们没有和中央人民政府农业部商量如何处理，即主观认为，把这批人员调回中央人民政府农业部“不容易”，并认为：“即使调回中央，也不好作适当的安插。”于是，我们便把其中一部分人员介绍到绥远省其他部门作汽车司机工作，把另外一部分人员介绍到中央林业干部学校学习。这是我们组织观念不强和主观主义所造成的错误。并且，当时我们的出发点，只是单纯地为了“安置”这批人员，没有为国家经济建设的长远利益计算，也缺乏培养青年干部的责任感。李玉琳等十同志的批评，引起我厅的重视，使我们深刻认识到对这批干部的处理是有严重错误的。今后，我们当接受这个教训。
    绥远省人民政府农林厅
