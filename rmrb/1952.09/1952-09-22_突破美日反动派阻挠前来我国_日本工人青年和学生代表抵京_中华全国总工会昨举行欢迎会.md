    Xinhua News Agency, 21st: In April of this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited Japanese trade unions to send representatives to participate in our country's May 1st Labor Day celebrations. Japanese trade unions and other mass organizations sent many representatives intending to come to our country, but they were unable to do so due to the unreasonable obstruction of the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan. However, Koze Kiyoshi, representative of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions and Central Committee Member of the Tokyo Civil Engineering and Construction General Union; Kojima Hiroki, member of the Wage Joint Struggle Liaison Council, Central Committee Member of the Government Office Workers' Council and the National Procurement Agency Workers' Union; Ogura Kinkichi, representative of the Japan Youth Fatherland Front; and Fukui Shunpei, representative of the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations, with the support of the Japanese working class, finally overcame various difficulties and arrived in Beijing not long ago.
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has invited representatives Koze Kiyoshi, Kojima Hiroki, Ogura Kinkichi, and Fukui Shunpei to participate in our country's National Day celebrations.
    Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a welcome reception on the 21st to welcome Japanese worker representative Koze Kiyoshi, Kojima Hiroki, youth representative Ogura Kinkichi, and student representative Fukui Shunpei, who were invited to our country to participate in May 1st Labor Day. The welcome reception was held in an atmosphere full of working-class international solidarity and friendship. Participants in the welcome reception included: Zhu Xuefan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Yang Zhihua, Deputy Minister of the Women Workers' Department; Jin Ziming, Deputy Minister of the International Liaison Department; Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation; Liu Guan Yi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace; and many representatives from all walks of life.
    Zhu Xuefan delivered a welcome speech, saying: This year, on May 1st International Labor Day, our All-China Federation of Trade Unions invited worker brothers from all over the world to come to our country for a visit. We warmly looked forward to Japanese worker brothers being able to participate in our New China's May 1st International Labor Day, because the solidarity and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people plays an important role in consolidating peace in Asia. The American and Japanese reactionaries were panic-stricken and exhausted all kinds of despicable means to obstruct representatives of Japanese workers, youth, and students from coming to China. But they have failed, and we have won. Your heroic actions of breaking through difficulties to come to China are a powerful blow to the American and Japanese reactionaries, a great victory for the Japanese people, and a victory that the people of China and Japan should celebrate together. This proves that the solidarity between Chinese and Japanese worker brothers, youth, and students cannot be stopped by any force and is growing deeper. Let me extend a warm welcome to all the representatives, and let us jointly celebrate the solidarity and friendship between Chinese and Japanese worker brothers, youth, and students.
    Japanese worker representative Koze Kiyoshi read out a joint written statement by him, Kojima Hiroki, Ogura Kinkichi, and Fukui Shunpei at the meeting. The statement said: Representatives of Japanese workers, youth, and students, breaking through the arrogant obstruction of American imperialism and the reactionary Yoshida government, have finally arrived in New China, and the working classes of China and Japan have been able to shake hands tightly. This fact has proved that no force can stop the international solidarity of the working class. Koze Kiyoshi and others expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese working class for their support and assistance to the struggle of Japanese workers and the Japanese people, as well as their kind invitation to send representatives to China. The statement concluded: The glorious victories and construction experiences of the Chinese working class have brought hope and confidence to the Japanese working class and people. We firmly believe that these victories and experiences will become a force for further promoting friendly cooperation among the nations of Asia and striving for peace in Asia.
    After the welcome reception, Zhu Xuefan, Yang Zhihua, and Jin Ziming jointly hosted a banquet for Koze Kiyoshi, Kojima Hiroki, Ogura Kinkichi, and Fukui Shunpei.
