Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 23rd:

    The Soviet magazine "Bolshevik" recently published in its seventeenth issue a long article by Miding, discussing Volume One of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Miding wrote: The publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's works is of great significance not only for the Chinese Communist Party but also for all Communist and Workers' Parties fighting for peace, people's democracy, and socialism. Mao Zedong's works profoundly reflect the activities of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, which for more than thirty years has organized and guided the Chinese people's heroic struggle against imperialist oppression. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, the people's revolution triumphed in China, which is the most important historical event after the Great Russian October Socialist Revolution and the Soviet Union's victory in World War II. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution dealt a powerful blow to the imperialist camp and further intensified the general crisis of capitalism. Mao Zedong is a long-tested leader of the Chinese Communist Party, who has consistently fought for the consolidation of the Party and against all its hidden and overt enemies. He creatively applied the great principles of Marxism-Leninism in the conditions of the Chinese revolution. Miding then introduced the situation of the Chinese revolutionary movement at the time the works in Volume One of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" were written, and narrated the main points of the major works in Volume One of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Speaking of "Strategic Problems in China's Revolutionary War," Miding wrote: In this work, Mao Zedong shows that he is not only a great military activist but also a military theorist, who is good at creatively applying the ideas of Lenin and Stalin in the specific conditions of China's revolutionary war. As the commander of the revolutionary war, Mao Zedong widely applied Marxist dialectics to summarize the richest experience of the Chinese Red Army.
    Miding concluded by writing: The historical significance of the Chinese revolution is great. Its soul and organizer is the glorious Chinese Communist Party. The strength of the Party and its long-tested leader Mao Zedong lies in its faithfulness to the theory of Marxism-Leninism. The works in Volume One of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" once again prove the greatness and invincibility of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Communist and Workers' Parties and peace fighters will study the works of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, with the greatest interest, and will be more convinced of the forever brilliant power of Marxist-Leninist theory, more convinced that the victorious course of history is irresistible, and more convinced that the victory of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism is inevitable.

    米丁著文论述毛泽东选集第一卷
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】苏联新近出版的“布尔什维克”杂志第十七期发表了米丁的一篇长文，论述“毛泽东选集”第一卷。米丁写道：毛泽东同志著作的出版，不仅对于中国共产党，而且对于所有为和平、人民民主与社会主义而斗争的共产党和工人党，都有巨大意义。毛泽东的著作深刻地反映了光荣的中国共产党的活动，这个党三十多年来组织和指导着中国人民反对帝国主义压迫的英勇斗争。在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导下，人民革命在中国胜利了，这是伟大的俄国十月社会主义革命和苏联在第二次世界大战中取得胜利以后最重要的历史事件。中国人民革命的胜利给予帝国主义阵营以有力的打击，使资本主义总危机更加尖锐化了。毛泽东是久经考验的中国共产党的领袖，他一贯地为党的巩固、为反对党的各种隐藏的和公开的敌人而斗争。他在中国革命的条件下创造地运用了伟大的马克思主义——列宁主义的原则。米丁接着介绍了“毛泽东选集”第一卷内作品写作时的中国革命运动情况，叙述了“毛泽东选集”第一卷内主要作品的要点。谈到“中国革命战争的战略问题”时，米丁写道：毛泽东在这篇著作里表现他不仅是一位伟大的军事活动家而且是一位军事理论家，他善于在中国革命战争的具体条件下创造地运用列宁—斯大林的思想。毛泽东作为革命战争的统帅，广泛地应用马克思主义辩证法来总结中国红军的最丰富的经验。
    米丁最后写道：中国革命的历史意义是伟大的。它的灵魂和组织者是光荣的中国共产党。党和它的久经考验的领袖毛泽东的力量在于忠实于马克思主义—列宁主义的理论。“毛泽东选集”第一卷中的著作，再一次地证明了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林理论的伟大与不可战胜。共产党和工人党以及和平斗士们会以最大的兴趣研究中国共产党领袖毛泽东的著作，会更加信服马克思主义—列宁主义理论永远辉煌的力量，更加信服历史的胜利进程是不可违拗的，更加信服和平、民主与社会主义事业的胜利是必然的。
