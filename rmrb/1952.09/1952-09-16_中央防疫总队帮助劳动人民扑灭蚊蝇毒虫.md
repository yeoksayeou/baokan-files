To the Editors: We are staff members of the Chaoyang Guanxiang Street Neighborhood Hygiene Committee in the former 10th District of Beijing. Recently, comrades from the Central Anti-Epidemic Corps came here and sprayed 666 pesticide from house to house, helping us to eradicate mosquitoes, flies, and pests. Afterwards, residents from all alleys and hygiene team leaders came to the Hygiene Committee to thank the People's Government for its concern for us working people. An old woman named Zhao said: "After the pesticide was sprayed, the mosquitoes and bedbugs were all killed. I can sleep soundly now. The female comrade who came to my house to spray carried a very heavy pesticide canister and bent over to spray under the bed. She was sweating profusely but didn't rest and didn't even drink a cup of tea. I will never forget Chairman Mao's kindness!" Sanlun worker Su Jingyun said: "Looking back, who cared about us 'poor people' outside the city! During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they came to demand 'hygiene donations' and 'cleanliness taxes' every few days, but there were dead cats and rotten dogs everywhere, festering with maggots and stench, and no one cared. After the People's Government came, there were street lights and tap water outside the city, and the roads were as smooth as mirrors. This time, the People's Government sent people to spray pesticide for us, helping us to eradicate mosquitoes, flies, and pests. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we working people enjoy such happiness." The broad masses of people have generally improved their understanding of the sanitation movement and are determined to further improve sanitation work to repay Chairman Mao's concern and care.

    中央防疫总队帮助劳动人民扑灭蚊蝇毒虫
    编辑同志：我们是北京市前第十区朝阳关厢街街道卫生委员会的工作人员。最近中央防疫总队的同志到我们这里来，挨户打六六六药水，帮助我们扑灭蚊蝇毒虫。事后，各巷居民及各卫生组长纷纷到卫生委员会来感谢人民政府对我们劳动人民的关心。某户赵老太太说：“打完药水后，蚊子、臭虫都死绝了，睡觉也安稳了。到我家打药水的那位女同志背着挺沉的药筒，弯下腰去往铺底下打药水，累得满头大汗也不休息，连碗茶都不喝。我真忘不了毛主席的好处！”三轮工人苏敬韵说：“回想过去，谁看得起我们城外的‘穷人’呀！国民党反动统治时，三天两头来要‘卫生捐’、‘清洁税’，可是遍地死猫烂狗，生蛆发臭，街上像猪圈一样，也没人管。人民政府来了，城外也有了路灯、自来水，路修得像镜子那么平。这回人民政府又派人来给我们打药水，帮助我们扑灭蚊蝇毒虫。只有在共产党、毛主席领导下，我们劳动人民才能得到这些幸福。”广大群众对卫生运动的认识普遍提高，决心进一步搞好卫生工作，来回答毛主席的关心和照顾。
