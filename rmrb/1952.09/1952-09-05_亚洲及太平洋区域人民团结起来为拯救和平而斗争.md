The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will open in the shortest possible time. This is a major event in the lives of people in the entire Asian and Pacific region. It not only demonstrates the growth and development of the peace movement in this region, but also the increasing awareness of the oppressed people of colonial and dependent countries.

Like the World Peace Congress, the representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will come from various countries and nationalities. Therefore, their living habits, ideologies, political attitudes, and religious beliefs will inevitably be different. What brings these people of different colors and beliefs together, like their own brothers and sisters, to discuss what they want to talk about and denounce what they hate? Nothing else, only for peace, for the safety and happiness of mankind. As Mr. Kingsbury, the American representative who attended the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in our capital this June, said well: "I am an American and have nothing to do with the Communist Party. I only advocate peace and hope to see the people of China, the Soviet Union, and the United States develop according to their own wishes and ideals. I don't want to see human civilization destroyed in the flames of war. I have children and grandchildren, which is why I came to China this time."

This is the essence of the peace conference.

However, a small group of warmongers who rely solely on sucking the blood of others to fatten themselves, in order to save their already crumbling war system, and to continue their privileges of exploitation and enslavement, not only hate the achievements of the peace cause, but even clamor madly and maliciously slander it, distorting the peace movement as "aggression," attempting to cover up the truth with insults.

Let the facts refute these abuses. May I ask, who ignited the flames of aggression in Korea? Who is pouring tens of thousands of tons of bombs, napalm bombs, and even germ bombs on hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children? And who is carrying out population trafficking and bloody suppression of prisoners under the guise of "humanitarian principles"? May I also ask, who put the Japanese people into the fate of a colony under the illegally packaged "Peace Treaty with Japan"? Who is illegally arming Japan, attempting to revive militarism? May I further ask, who is organizing aggressive military alliances overtly and covertly, threatening and endangering the people of Vietnam and Malaya? May I even ask, who has erected heavy iron curtains between countries, using "blockades" and "embargoes" to hinder international friendship and the normal development of the economy?

It is very obvious that these are the actions of a small group of warmongers. If they had their way, they could launch a world war. However, with the rising tide of the peace movement, the aggressors' plans have been disrupted, and the aggressors' ambitions have been punished to a certain extent.

However, we must not be paralyzed. Although the peace movement has united most of the masses, the peace potential that is being tapped has not been able to exert its strength to the maximum. This is one aspect. On the other hand, a small group of bellicose imperialists, in order to consolidate their position, their "manic marching music" has been played more and more frantically. In order to save peace, we have to continue to work hard and strive for greater achievements.

The population of the Asian and Pacific countries accounts for more than two-thirds of the world's population, so the peace cause in this region has a great relationship to the world peace cause. Because of the large area, many countries, different systems, different nationalities, the people's way of life must be different. But this does not matter. The peace movement is only for the happiness of mankind. To strive for survival, there is no need to force uniformity in the way of life of mankind. As Ehrenburg said at the Special Session of the World Peace Council in Berlin: "Everyone has the right to like or dislike a certain way of life, to regard it as high or low. But if this way of life satisfies the Americans, no one has any right to interfere with it, and no one does interfere with it." Then he added: "I never believe that a person who respects his own mother will insult his neighbor's mother. I never believe that a person who considers his own family sacred and inviolable will commit crimes in his neighbor's house. Every nation cherishes its own way of life. Ordinary Americans who like the American way of life must respect the customs, laws, habits, and hobbies of other nations. You cannot spread an idea with bombs. You cannot instill a hobby with shells."

The problem is already very clear. Regardless of beliefs, systems, nationalities, or countries, as long as we love peace, we are fellow travelers. However, scattered forces are weak. Only by uniting can we achieve victory. This is as Mr. Sa-nguan Tularak, the Thai representative who attended the preparatory meeting, said: "The various ethnic groups in Thailand know that true peace must be obtained through true struggle. They understand that their own strength is very small. It seems impossible to realize this hope by fighting alone. They must cooperate with the people and peace fighters of Asian and Pacific countries, including the cooperation with the American people and the Japanese people."

Unite closely! People of the entire Asian and Pacific region, let us fight to save peace in this region and even the peace of the whole world. (Xinhua News Agency)

    亚洲及太平洋区域人民团结起来为拯救和平而斗争
    北京大学校长  马寅初
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议于最短期间即将开幕了。这是全亚洲及太平洋区域人民生活上的一件大事。它不仅说明了这个地区的和平运动的成长和发展，也说明了被压迫的殖民地和附属国人民觉悟程度的日益提高。
    和世界和平大会的情况一样，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的出席代表，将来自各个不同的国家、不同的民族，因而他们的生活习惯、思想意识、政治态度、宗教信仰也就必然各各不同。是什么东西把这些不同色彩、不同信仰的人串连在一起，一如自己的兄弟姊妹似地共聚一堂，畅谈自己所要谈的话，痛斥自己所痛恨的事呢？没有别的，只是为了和平，为了人类的安全和幸福。出席今年六月在我国首都召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的美国代表金斯伯利说得好：“我是美国人，和共产党没有关系。我只是主张和平，愿意看到中国、苏联和美国的人民都能够各按他们自己的愿望和理想发展，不愿看到人类文明在炮火中毁灭。我有孩子，也有孙子，这就是我这次为什么到中国来的理由。”
    和平会议的真谛正是这个。
    然而，一小撮专靠吮吸他人的鲜血来养肥自己的战争贩子们，为了挽救其业已摇摇欲坠的战争体系，为了继续其剥削与奴役的特权，他们不仅仇视和平事业既得的成就，甚且疯狂叫嚣，恶意诋毁，把和平运动歪曲为“侵略”，企图用侮蔑掩盖真理。
    让事实来驳斥这些滥言吧。请问，是谁在朝鲜燃烧起侵略的战火？是谁在向着成千累万的男女和儿童倾泻着成万吨的炸弹、凝固汽油弹、以至于细菌弹？又是谁在“人道原则”的伪装下进行着人口贩卖和对俘虏的血腥镇压？再请问，是谁在一手包办的非法的“对日和约”下把日本人民投入了殖民地的命运？是谁在非法地武装日本，企图把军国主义复活？还请问，是谁在明里暗里组织着侵略性的军事同盟，威胁和危害着越南、马来亚人民？更请问，是谁在国与国之间挂起了重重铁幕，用“封锁”、“禁运”阻碍了国际间的友谊和经济的正常发展？
    非常明显，这些都是一小撮战争贩子的作为。如果按照他们的愿望，他们可以发动一次世界大战，然而，在和平运动日益高涨的情况下，侵略者的计划被打乱了，侵略者的野心已受到了一定的惩罚。
    但是，我们决不能麻痹。和平运动虽已团结了大部分的群众，但正在掘发中的和平潜力却还没有能够把它的力量发挥到最大限度，这是一方面。另一方面，一小撮好战的帝国主义者，为了巩固其地位，他们的“狂躁进行曲”已吹奏得日甚一日地狂乱了，为了拯救和平，我们不得不继续努力，争取更大的成就。
    亚洲及太平洋区域国家的人口占全世界三分之二以上，因而这一地区的和平事业对于世界和平事业有极大的关系。由于地区大，国家多，制度不同，民族互异，人民的生活方式必然不同。但这是没有关系的。和平运动只是为了谋取人类的幸福。要争取生存，不必强求人类生活方式的一致。正如爱伦堡在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上所说过的：“每一个人都有权利喜欢或者不喜欢这样的一种生活方式，把它看得高或者看得低。但是，如果这种生活方式使美国人满意，没有人有任何权利去干涉它，而且也并没有人去干涉它。”接着他还说：“我从来不相信一个尊敬自己母亲的人会凌辱邻人的母亲。我从来不相信一个认为自己家庭是神圣不可侵犯的人会在邻人的家里为非作歹。每一个民族都珍爱自己的生活方式。喜欢美国生活方式的普通美国人，必须尊重别的民族的风俗、法律、习惯、嗜好。你不能用炸弹去传布一种观念。你不能用炮弹去灌输一种嗜好。”
    问题已经非常明显了，不分信仰，不分制度，不分民族，不分国别，只要是爱好和平的，我们就是同路人。但是，分散的力量是微弱的，只有团结起来，才能取得胜利，这正如出席筹备会议的泰国代表?沙愿·都拉叻所说的：“泰国各民族知道，真正的和平是必须经过真正的斗争才能得到的。他们明白自己的力量是很小的，独自进行斗争，似乎不可能实现这一希望，必须与亚洲和太平洋区域各国的人民与和平战士合作，包括和美国人民、日本人民的合作在内。”
    紧密地团结起来吧！全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，让我们为拯救本地区的和平、乃至全世界的和平而斗争。（新华社）
