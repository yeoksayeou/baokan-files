    Under the kind instruction of Chairman Mao, Further Advance Youth Work
    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League
    Thanks to the kind instruction of Chairman Mao and the close leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Third Plenary Session of the Youth League has achieved significant results.
    The first achievement of the Plenary Session is: according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we pointed out in the resolution that guiding youth to be good at learning is a "more particularly prominent task" for the Youth League in the future. Accordingly, it explicitly stipulated that "the questions of learning, the questions of combining learning and work, and the question of how the Youth League can assist the Party in educating the entire younger generation are the benchmarks for the Youth League to measure its own work."
    Everyone knows that the Youth League has always regarded organizing members to study hard and leading young people to study as its particularly prominent task. During the long and arduous years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Youth League guided the vast number of young people to learn how to overthrow the enemy, especially how to take up arms to overthrow the enemy. After the enemy was overthrown, it continued to work hard to learn how to carry out various social reforms, eliminate obstacles to national construction, and create conditions. History is the best notary, and it proves that Chinese youth, in this series of great struggles, have generally learned well. It is precisely because of this that Chairman Mao used "played a certain vanguard role" to evaluate Chinese youth.
    So, why is it now emphasized that learning has become a more particularly prominent task for Chinese youth? This is because our motherland has entered a new historical period. As the resolution writes: "Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the great motherland has completed a series of social reforms and achieved a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation; it has powerfully resisted the aggression of American imperialism and strengthened national defense; and it is now welcoming a high tide of large-scale economic construction and cultural construction." In this new and greater historical period, if Chinese youth are to be worthy of being taught by Mao Zedong, they "must actively participate in the construction of the motherland and stand at the forefront of the construction of the motherland." If Chinese youth are to be able to stand at the forefront of national construction in a true sense, they must first understand that construction cannot only rely on courage and enthusiasm, but also on more knowledge. Comrade Stalin said it well: "During the period of domestic war, the enemy's positions could be won by attacking, courage, force, and cavalry-like charges. Now, under the conditions of peaceful economic construction, cavalry-like charges can only mess things up." Chinese youth are heroic and active, but we should frankly admit that our knowledge is insufficient, and new modern scientific knowledge is even more insufficient. What is the way to acquire new knowledge? The only way out is the path pointed out by Comrade Lenin: "Study, study, and study again."
    Thus, the Third Plenary Session clearly stipulated: "All League organizations across the country should, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Party committees at all levels, conduct in-depth propaganda among the vast number of young people about the great victories of the motherland in the past three years and the great prospects of the motherland, and launch a high tide of working hard to learn and work hard for the construction of the great motherland." The Third Plenary Session also clearly stipulated: In industrial and mining enterprises, the Youth League should vigorously assist the Party in carrying out the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, encourage young workers to actively learn culture, learn advanced production experience, and constantly improve their technical level. In rural areas, the Youth League should vigorously assist the Party in promoting the patriotic bumper harvest competition and mutual aid and cooperation movement, and encourage young farmers to actively learn culture, learn new agricultural techniques, and advanced production experience. In the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the Youth League should encourage young people to actively learn culture and actively learn modern military technology. In schools, the Youth League should encourage students to study hard so that they can work well for the construction of the motherland after graduation. The Third Plenary Session also clearly stipulated: The Youth League should actively cultivate new morals of serving the people among the vast number of young people, and all Youth League members should not only have the revolutionary spirit to overcome all difficulties and strive to become models of learning and work, but also use the methods of persuasion and education to unite and guide the young people around them to work hard to learn and work hard. The Third Plenary Session also clearly stipulated: All cadres of the Youth League must take the lead in learning in their work, "not only should they work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and study the Party's policies, but they must also strive to have the necessary specialized knowledge according to the needs of their work posts." The Third Plenary Session issued a call to the youth of the country with two sentences from Comrade Lenin, namely: Young people should all be knowledgeable and at the same time be good at labor. The national organizations of the Youth League must strive to realize these two sentences of the great revolutionary teacher.
    The second achievement of the Third Plenary Session of the Youth League is: under the repeated education and enlightenment of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, it has fundamentally clarified in ideology and principle how the Youth League's various levels of League committees should work.
    If the Youth League's various levels of League committees want to do their work better and be able to reflect the Party's assistant role with solid work achievements, according to the experience over the years, they must first consolidate the League's obedience to the Party's leadership, and second, they must go deep into the masses and conscientiously study the experience in mass work.
    Regarding the issue of consolidating the League's obedience to the Party's leadership, the comrades of the Youth League must always keep in mind Comrade Stalin's instruction: "Obeying the Party's leadership is the most important thing in the entire work of the Youth League." Obeying the Party's leadership is by no means empty talk. First, it is necessary to conscientiously study the Party's guidelines and policies and implement these guidelines and policies into one's own work. Only in this way can the Party's leadership be politically guaranteed. Second, do not overemphasize the League's system leadership, but must practically respect the leadership of local Party committees. The higher-level League committees must take into account the overall situation of various regions, and must not abandon the characteristics of each region and put forward their own subjective and idealistic rigid and uniform work instructions to the lower-level League committees. On the contrary, the higher-level League committees should regularly supervise the lower-level League committees to conscientiously implement the instructions of the local Party committees. Only in this way can the Party's leadership be guaranteed organizationally. Third, each League committee must conscientiously obey the Party committee's entire work deployment, especially to obey the Party committee's central work. Under the Party committee's entire intention, with reference to the work direction of the higher-level League committee, put forward the League's practical and feasible work plan. Only in this way can the Party's leadership be guaranteed in work. Fourth, the League committee must ask the Party committee for instructions at any time for things it does not understand. For the shortcomings and mistakes that may occur in certain places and certain departments, use the method of active and correct criticism and self-criticism to assist the Party in overcoming them under the leadership of the Party.
    Regarding the issue of going deep into the masses and studying experience, it should be deeply understood that the work of the Youth League is a mass work. It should always be concerned about the Party's political direction and policies, but it cannot plan political directions and various policies like the Party. Therefore, it should avoid issuing policy decisions arbitrarily and should prevent lengthy and empty instructions. All policy issues, no matter how big or small, must be decided after asking the Party committee for instructions. The Youth League should implement the practice of responsible cadres personally taking action to study experience from below. On the one hand, study the various work experiences of leading cadres and led cadres, and on the other hand, study the various activity experiences of production, technology, and learning in the masses. After a usable experience is summarized, it must be disseminated by rapid and effective methods after being approved by the Party committee. If it cannot be disseminated, even the best experience will not have the due effect. The Third Plenary Session pointed out that this method is an important method used by the League committees at all levels to guide the work of lower levels and to educate young people.
    The third achievement of the Third Plenary Session of the Youth League is: from affirming the past work achievements of the whole League and seriously criticizing the mistakes of individual cadres, it is clear that the work style of the League cadres has great significance for the good or bad of the work.
    The Third Plenary Session believes that since the establishment of the League, the work of the whole League has achieved tremendous results. It has guided the vast number of League members and young people to participate in various great practical struggles. In various practical struggles, the League's organization has grown day by day. It now has more than six million members, and under the leadership of the Party, it has become an important shock force for consolidating our country's people's democratic dictatorship and building a great motherland. The Third Plenary Session believes that the acquisition of this great achievement, in addition to relying on the Party's correct and strong leadership, also relies on the loyal and active efforts of the vast majority of cadres and League members throughout the League. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session confirms that under the leadership of the Party, a good work style of down-to-earth hard work and vigor has been established among the cadres of the Youth League. However, the Third Plenary Session, with a serious and responsible attitude towards the people, the Party, and the vast number of young people, criticized the mistakes of individual cadres in the League. These individual comrades, either because they are burdened with the baggage of meritorious officials, are dizzy and arrogant; or because they have not undergone strict ideological reform, their class consciousness is blurred, and they lack the upright work style of the Youth League. Thus, these individual comrades generate individualism and pursuit of fame in their thinking, and even violate the interests of the Party and the people. In their work, formalism occurs, or they cannot do big things, and are unwilling to do small things; or they make a lot of noise on the surface, but are actually empty. The Third Plenary Session believes that the work of the League is a cause of the people, and the cadres of the League should become the role models of the youth. Therefore, maintaining and carrying forward the good work style of vigor and down-to-earth hard work in the League, and preventing and opposing the work style of individualism and formalism, is one of the important keys to carrying out the future work of the Youth League. The Third Plenary Session requires all League cadres to firmly remember the following two paragraphs of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao said in "The Position of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War": "Selfishness, passive laziness, corruption and degeneration, pursuit of fame, etc., are the most contemptible; while selflessness, active efforts, self-denial and public service, and the spirit of hard work are respectable." Chairman Mao also said in "In Memory of Bethune": "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his extreme sense of responsibility in his work and his extreme enthusiasm towards his comrades and the people. ... We must all learn from his spirit of utter selflessness. Starting from this point, one can become a person who is of great benefit to the people. A person's ability may be great or small, but as long as he has this spirit, he is a noble person, a pure person, a moral person, a person who has transcended vulgar interests, and a person who is beneficial to the people." According to these instructions of Chairman Mao, the Third Plenary Session calls on all League cadres to work together to loyally serve as the people's servants and loyally serve as the good friends of the youth.
    The Third Plenary Session successfully closed, and its gains are huge. However, these gains have not yet been transformed into the actual practice of the whole League, but we firmly believe that under the kind instruction of Chairman Mao and the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Party committees at all levels, relying on the efforts of the comrades of the whole League, we will definitely be able to further advance youth work.

    在毛主席的亲切教导下把青年工作更加推向前进
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记　胡耀邦
    由于得到了毛主席的亲切教导和党中央的密切领导，青年团的三中全会，获得了重大的成就。
    全会的第一个成就是：根据毛主席的指示，我们在决议中指出了引导青年善于学习，是青年团今后的一个“更加特别突出的任务”。并因此明确地规定了“关于学习的问题，关于学习和工作相结合的问题，关于青年团如何协助党教育好整个青年一代的问题，乃是青年团测验自己工作的标志”。
    谁都知道，青年团历来就是以组织团员努力学习和带领青年群众学习，作为它的一个特别突出的任务。在长久艰难的岁月中，青年团在中国共产党的领导下，引导着广大青年，学习如何打倒敌人，特别是学习如何拿起武器打倒敌人。在敌人被打倒之后，又接着努力学习如何进行各项社会改革，为建设祖国扫除障碍，创造条件。历史是最好的公证人，它证明中国青年，在这一系列的伟大斗争中，一般地是学习得不坏的。也正因为如此，毛主席才用“起了某种先锋队的作用”来估价中国青年。
    那末，现在为什么强调学习成为中国青年更加特别突出的任务呢？这就是因为我们祖国已转到一个新的历史时期。正如决议所写的：“由于党中央和毛主席的英明领导，伟大的祖国已经完成了一系列的社会改革，取得了财政经济情况的根本好转；有力地抗击了美帝国主义的侵略，加强了国防；现在正迎接着大规模的经济建设与文化建设的高潮”。在这个新的更伟大的历史时期中，中国青年要不愧是毛泽东所教导出来的，就“必须积极地参加祖国的建设，站在祖国建设的前列”。中国青年要能够名符其实地站在祖国建设的前列，首先必须明白：建设不能只指靠勇敢和热情，还要指靠更多的知识。斯大林同志说得好：“在国内战争时期，敌人阵地是可以用攻打、勇敢、猛力、骑兵似的冲锋取得的，现在，在和平经济建设条件下，用骑兵似的冲锋，只能是把事情搞坏。”中国青年是英勇积极的，但我们应该坦白承认，我们的知识是不足的，新的现代化的科学知识更加不足。用什么办法获得新知识呢，唯一的出路就是列宁同志所指给我们的道路：“学习、学习、再学习”。
    这样，三中全会就明确规定：“全国团的组织都应该在党中央和各级党委领导下，向广大青年深入宣传祖国三年来的伟大胜利和祖国的伟大远景，掀起为建设伟大祖国而努力学习和努力工作的热潮”。三中全会又明确规定：在工矿企业中，青年团要大力协助党开展爱国增产节约运动，鼓舞青年工人积极学习文化，学习先进生产经验，不断地提高自己的技术水平。在农村中，青年团要大力协助党推行爱国丰产竞赛和互助合作运动，鼓舞青年农民积极学习文化，学习新的农业技术和先进生产经验。在人民解放军和人民志愿军中，青年团要鼓舞青年积极学好文化，积极学习现代化的军事技术。在学校中，青年团要鼓舞同学努力学好功课，以便毕业后能为建设祖国很好地工作。三中全会又明确规定：青年团要积极地在广大青年中培养为人民服务的新道德，而所有的青年团员不但要具有克服一切困难的革命精神，争取成为学习和工作的模范，而且要用说服和教育的方法，团结和引导自己周围的青年群众努力学习和努力工作。三中全会还明确规定：青年团的一切干部，必须要在工作中带头学习，“不但要努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作，学习党的政策，并且要依据自己工作岗位的需要，努力具备必要的专门知识”。三中全会用列宁同志的两句话向全国青年发出号召，这两句话就是：青年人应该个个都是有知识的，同时又都是善于劳动的。全国青年团的组织，必须为实现伟大革命导师这两句话而努力奋斗。
    青年团三中全会的第二个成就是：在党中央和毛主席的反覆教育和启发下，从思想上原则上基本弄清楚了青年团的各级团委应该如何工作。
    青年团的各级团委，要把工作作得更好，要能够以切实的工作成绩来体现党的助手作用，根据历年来的经验，首先必须巩固团服从党的领导，其次必须深入群众，认真地研究群众工作中的经验。
    关于巩固团服从党的领导的问题。青年团的同志必须经常牢牢记住斯大林同志的指示：“服从党的领导，是青年团全部工作中之最主要的一件事。”服从党的领导绝不是一句空话，第一，要认真地研究党的方针政策，并把这些方针政策贯彻到自己的工作中去，只有这样，才能从政治上保证党的领导。第二，不要过分强调团的系统领导，而要切切实实地尊重各地党委的领导。上级团委必须顾及各地的全面情况，切不可抛开各个地区的特点，向下级团委提出自己的主观空想的硬性的千篇一律的工作指示，相反的，上级团委应该要经常监督下级团委切实贯彻当地党委的指示，只有这样，才能从组织上保证党的领导。第三，每个团委要切实服从党委的整个工作部署，特别要服从党委的中心工作，在党委的整个意图下，参照上级团委的工作方向，提出团的切实可行的工作计划。只有这样，才能从工作上保证党的领导。第四，团委不懂得的东西，要随时向党委请示。对于某些地方和某些部门可能发生的缺点和错误，要采用积极的正确的批评和自我批评的办法，在党的领导下协助党去克服它。
    关于深入群众，研究经验的问题。应当深刻了解：青年团的工作是一种群众性的工作，它应当经常关心党的政治方向和政策，但它不能像党一样去规划政治方向和各种政策，因而它应当避免乱发政策性的决定，应当防止长篇大论的空洞指示，所有关于政策性的问题，不论大小，均须请示党委后决定。青年团应当实行负责干部亲自动手，从下面研究经验。一方面研究领导干部和被领导干部的各种工作经验，另一方面研究群众中生产的、技术的、学习的各种活动经验。每当一个可用的经验综合起来之后，要经过党委同意，用迅速而有效的方法传播出去，如果不能传播出去，那怕是最好的经验，也起不到应有的作用。三中全会指出，这个方法是各级团委用来指导下级工作和教育青年群众的重要方法。
    青年团三中全会的第三个成就是：从肯定全团过去的工作成绩和严肃地批判个别干部的错误中，明确了团的干部的作风对于工作好坏有极大意义。
    三中全会认为：建团以来，全团的工作，成绩是巨大的。它引导着广大团员群众和青年群众参加了各种伟大的实际斗争，在各种实际斗争中，团的组织日益壮大，现在拥有六百万以上的团员，在党的领导下，已经成为巩固我国人民民主专政和建设伟大祖国的一支重要的突击力量。三中全会认为：这个伟大成绩的获得，除依靠了党的正确而坚强的领导之外，也依靠了全团绝大多数干部和广大团员忠实积极的努力。因而，三中全会确认：在党的领导下，青年团的干部中已经树立起一种踏实苦干朝气勃勃的优良的作风。但三中全会同时以对人民对党和对广大青年的严肃负责态度，批判了团内个别干部的错误，这些个别同志，或者由于背上功臣包袱，昏头昏脑，骄傲自大；或者由于没有经过严格的思想改造，阶级意识模糊，缺乏青年团的正派的作风。这样，这些个别同志，在思想上就产生个人主义和风头主义，甚至违反党和人民的利益。在工作上就发生形式主义，或者是大事干不来，小事不肯干；或者是表面上搞得轰轰烈烈，实际上空空洞洞。三中全会认为：团的工作是人民的一种事业，团的干部应该成为青年的表率，因而，保持和发扬团内那种朝气勃勃踏实苦干的优良作风，防止和反对那种个人主义、形式主义的作风，乃是开展青年团今后工作的重要关键之一。三中全会要求全团干部牢牢地记住毛主席下面的两段话。毛主席在“中国共产党在民族战争中的地位”一文中说：“自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的；而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干的精神，才是可尊敬的。”毛主席又在“纪念白求恩”一文中说：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端热忱。……我们大家要学习他毫无自私自利之心的精神。从这点出发，就可以变为大有利于人民的人。一个人能力有大小，但只要有这点精神，就是一个高尚的人，一个纯粹的人，一个有道德的人，一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人”。根据毛主席的这些指示，三中全会号召全团干部一致努力，忠诚地当人民的勤务员，忠诚地当青年的好朋友。
    三中全会胜利地闭幕了，它的收获是巨大的，不过这些收获还没有变为全团的实际，但我们深信，在毛主席的亲切教导下，在党中央和各级党委的坚强领导下，依靠全团同志的努力，我们一定能把青年工作更加推向前进。
