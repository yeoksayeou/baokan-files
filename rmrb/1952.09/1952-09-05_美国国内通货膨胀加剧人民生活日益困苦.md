    Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: As a result of the U.S. ruling group's policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, the pressure of domestic inflation in the United States is increasing. With the rising cost of living and continuously increasing taxes, the lives of the American people are becoming increasingly difficult.

    Since the beginning of this year, the cost of living for the American people has continued to rise. According to a report issued by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on August 21, recent surveys have proven that the cost of living for middle-income families in U.S. cities has risen for five consecutive months. According to figures released by the bureau, with the average of 1935-39 as 100, the cost of living index was 172.5 in July 1950 when the Korean War just broke out, rose to 189.1 in January of this year, and further increased to 190.8 in July. In fact, these greatly reduced official figures do not reflect the actual situation in the United States today. Officials of the U.S. Economic Stabilization Agency also admit that the cost of living in the United States today has reached an "unprecedented peak." Statistics from the U.S. "National Industrial Conference Board" also show that the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar in June had fallen to a "record-breaking" low. Currently, one U.S. dollar can only purchase goods worth 55.3 cents in January 1939. The trend of inflation is still continuing to develop. A United Press dispatch from Washington on August 23 revealed: "National inflation in the United States continues, and it is unlikely to stop after the new government takes office in January."

    On the one hand, the cost of living is rising steadily, and on the other hand, the U.S. government is constantly increasing the tax burden on the American people. The rate of increase in U.S. taxes has far exceeded the rate of increase in U.S. national income. According to materials from the U.S. Department of Commerce, if the total personal income of the U.S. population in 1951 is calculated on a per capita basis, then each person's income increased by only 10 percent compared to 1950. However, U.S. taxes increased dramatically during the same period. According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, federal taxes paid by the American people in the 1951-52 fiscal year reached a "record-breaking" figure of $65 billion. This amount is nearly 29 percent higher than the $50.5 billion in the first year of the Korean War in the 1950-51 fiscal year, and it does not include the billions of dollars in taxes that state and local governments collect from American taxpayers each year. U.S. taxes will continue to increase in the 1952-53 fiscal year. According to "U.S. News & World Report" on April 25, the taxes to be collected this year will reach more than $80 billion, and the average American will bear $523.

    The heavy tax burden falls first on the shoulders of the American working people. According to the London "Economist" magazine on March 29, an American worker with three dependents earning $3,500 a year has to pay $798 in indirect taxes and $299 in income tax, totaling about $1,100. This means that the U.S. government takes away one-third of the annual income of an American worker with family burdens through taxation.

    At the same time, although the labor intensity of American workers is constantly increasing, the actual income of workers is becoming less and less. Taking the steelworkers who held a major strike in June as an example, before the wage increase, 60 percent of steelworkers' wages were lower than the officially published "minimum living expenses." And some low-wage workers earn only half of this "minimum living expenses." Workers work up to ten to twelve hours a day, and sometimes work for ten consecutive days without getting overtime pay.

    美国国内通货膨胀加剧人民生活日益困苦
    【新华社二日讯】美国统治集团推行扩军备战政策的结果，美国国内通货膨胀的压力正在加大。在生活费用上涨、捐税不断增加的情况下，美国人民的生活日益困苦。
    今年以来，美国人民的生活费用不断高涨。据美国劳工统计局八月二十一日的报告指出，最近的调查证明美国城市里中等收入的家庭的生活费用已连续上涨了五个月。根据该局发表的数字，以一九三五—三九年平均数为一百，一九五○年七月份朝鲜战争刚爆发时，生活费用指数为一七二·五，到今年一月份上升到一八九·一，七月份又上涨到一九○·八。事实上，这些大大缩小了的官方数字并不能反映美国当前的实际情况，美国经济稳定署的官员们也承认，今日美国的生活费用已经达到了“空前高峰”。美国“全国工业会议委员会”的统计也说明，六月间美元的购买力已下降到“打破纪录的”最低点，目前美金一元只能购买一九三九年一月价值五角五分三厘的东西。目前通货膨胀的趋势仍在继续发展，合众社华盛顿二十三日电透露：“美国全国通货继续膨胀，明年一月新政府上任后也不见得会停止。”
    一方面生活费用节节上升，另一方面美国政府又不断加重美国人民的捐税负担。美国捐税增加的速度已大大超过了美国国民收入增加的速度。根据美国商务部的材料，一九五一年美国国民个人收入总额如果用总人口来平均计算，那么每人收入比起一九五○年只增加了百分之十。但是，同时期内美国捐税却有了惊人的增加。据美国国内税务局宣布，一九五一—五二会计年度美国人民缴纳的联邦税款已达“创纪录”的数字，计六百五十亿美元。这个数目比朝鲜战争第一年一九五○—五一会计年度增加了将近百分之二十九，而且它还不包括各州及各地方政府每年要向美国纳税人征收的数以十亿计的税款在内。一九五二—五三会计年度美国的捐税仍将继续增加，据四月二十五日“美国新闻与世界报道”计算，本年度应征税款将达八百亿美元以上，美国人民每人平均将负担五二三美元。
    沉重的捐税负担首先落在美国劳动人民的肩上。据三月二十九日伦敦“经济学家”杂志报道，一个有三个眷属年入三千五百美元的美国工人，要付出七九八美元的间接税，二九九美元的所得税，共计约一千一百美元。这就是说，美国政府通过税收拿走了有家庭负担的美国工人全年收入的三分之一。
    与此同时，美国工人劳动强度虽然不断加强，但是工人们的实际收入却越来越少。以今年六月曾举行大罢工的钢铁工人为例，在增加工资以前，百分之六十的钢铁工人的工资低于官方所发表的“最低限度生活费用”。而一部分低薪的工人，其所得只有这个“最低限度生活费用”的一半。工人们每天工作多至十至十二小时，有时一连工作十天却得不到逾时工作津贴。
