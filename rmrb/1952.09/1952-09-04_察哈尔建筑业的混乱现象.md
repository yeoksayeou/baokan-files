    Chaotic Phenomena in the Construction Industry of Chahar
    To the Editor: There are some chaotic phenomena in the construction industry of Chahar Province that urgently need to be corrected. First, some units, in order to complete their production increase and savings plans, are actually cutting corners and reducing the quality of construction projects. For example, at the construction site of the nursery of the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, two truckloads of lime were delivered. The delivery note stated that each truck was 4,000 catties, but after weighing, it was found that each truck was short 500 catties. Furthermore, according to regulations, 450 bricks should be used to build one cubic meter of volume. However, Zhangjiakou City Construction Company required on-site workers to use only 440 bricks. The original regulation stipulated that construction management fees should not exceed 14.4%, but when Zhangjiakou City Construction Company calculated management fees for the Chahar Daily, it was calculated at 18.5%, exceeding the original regulation.
    Secondly, to date, the phenomenon of blind construction still exists. For example, in the engineering project of the Institute of Technology, after walls more than one person high had already been built, it was discovered that there were errors in the design, and the drawings were withdrawn for redesign. However, the bricklaying project did not stop, and when the new drawings were designed, the project was also completed.
    These problems have initially attracted the attention of the relevant leading departments of Chahar Province, but we believe that a thorough inspection should be carried out, otherwise, we will not be able to successfully complete this year's basic construction and production increase and savings tasks.

### 察哈尔建筑业的混乱现象

    察哈尔建筑业的混乱现象
    编辑同志：察哈尔省建筑业中目前存在着一些混乱现象，急应纠正。首先是有的单位为了完成增产节约计划，竟然偷工减料，降低建筑工程的质量。例如中共察哈尔省委员会托儿所工地，有一次运来两车石灰，提货单上写着每车是四千斤，但经过秤后，发现每车少五百斤。又如按照规定，砌一立方公尺的体积应用砖四百五十块。但张家口市建筑公司却要现场工人只用四百四十块砖。原来规定建筑管理费不得超过百分之十四点四，可是张家口市建筑公司给察哈尔日报计算管理费时却按百分之十八点五计算，超过原来的规定。
    其次，到目前为止，盲目施工的现象依然存在着。例如：工学院的工程，已经筑起一人多高的墙了，才发觉设计有错误，把图撤回去重新设计。但砌墙工程仍未停止，当新图设计好，工程也结束了。
    这些问题，虽已初步引起了察哈尔省有关领导部门的注意，但是，我们认为还应进行深入的检查，不然就不能胜利完成今年的基本建设和增产节约任务。觉民　张兰秀
