    Winter Wheat High-Yield Cultivation Techniques (Provisional Outline)
    Ministry of Agriculture, Central People's Government

    In recent years, significant achievements have been made in wheat production across various regions. The national total output has recovered to pre-war levels, and many high-yield models have emerged during the patriotic high-yield competition, creating many scientific high-yield cultivation techniques. However, many unreasonable phenomena still exist, failing to fully unleash the potential for wheat yield increase. To further implement the Central People's Government's directive on concentrating efforts to increase the unit area yield of agricultural production, the following provisional outline of winter wheat high-yield cultivation techniques is formulated based on the experience of high-yield models in various regions and with reference to advanced Soviet scientific theories:

    I. Deep Plowing and Early Plowing for Drought Prevention and Moisture Conservation: Deep plowing is an effective measure to improve soil structure, enhance soil fertility, and conserve soil moisture, and it greatly benefits wheat root development and weed control. In most wheat-producing areas of China, two-fifths to three-fifths of the annual rainfall is concentrated in July, August, and September. Therefore, deep plowing is a prerequisite for drought prevention and moisture conservation. Deep plowing should be done early rather than late. Early plowing can extend the soil weathering period and enhance the soil's water storage capacity. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to vigorously promote new-style walking plows and organize combined fine plowing (note) to achieve deep plowing. It is required that all regions universally deepen the plowing depth by half an inch to one inch based on the current situation. The general principle for deep plowing standards is to reach five to seven inches.

    1. In dry farming areas with one crop per year, different tillage methods should be fully utilized to receive summer rain. Immediately after wheat harvest, shallow plow (use a plow without a moldboard to clear the stubble), and after the rain, carry out deep plowing according to the deep plowing standard, turning crop roots, stems, and weeds into the soil. Do not harrow or level after plowing, allowing the turned-out soil to be exposed to the sun and weathered. After this, conduct shallow plowing based on rainfall and weed growth, and conduct the final shallow plowing two to three inches deep before sowing. Harrow and level after plowing to make the soil uniform and flat.

    2. In areas with three crops in two years or two crops in one year, intertillage should be carried out in autumn crop fields in summer to receive summer rain. Immediately after harvesting autumn crops, clear the stubble along the ridges and loosen the soil, then carry out deep plowing according to the standard. Harrow and level after plowing. If there is a long time before sowing (two to three weeks before sowing), strive to do another shallow plowing before sowing.

    3. In some areas, farmers deep plow with iron shovels every three to four years, reaching about one foot deep, which has an excellent effect on soil improvement and high yield.

    4. In arid areas, in addition to paying attention to water storage and drought prevention, mobilize the masses to accumulate snow and transport ice in winter to increase soil moisture. In the Jiangnan area, drainage work should be done well to prepare favorable conditions for wheat growth.

    5. In the north, harrowing in early spring can reduce soil moisture evaporation, promote air circulation, which is conducive to the activity of bacteria in the soil. At the same time, the spores of pathogens and insect eggs on the leaves can also be harrowed away and weeds can be eliminated, which is extremely beneficial to the growth of wheat seedlings. Harrowing should be carried out immediately after the soil thaws in early spring, and topdressing should be applied before harrowing. After this, except for appropriate cultivation and loosening of the soil due to fertilization, irrigation, or rainfall, there is generally no need for excessive weeding.

    II. Close Planting: Implementing close planting is the most effective measure to make full use of soil fertility, reduce soil moisture evaporation and weeds, to achieve high yields. The main shortcomings in current wheat cultivation are wide row spacing, narrow sowing width, and small sowing amount. Therefore, it is necessary to shorten row spacing, widen sowing width, and increase sowing amount to increase the number of plants per unit area.

    1. In areas with row sowing, for those with row spacing of six to eight inches, the method of widening the sowing width by leaning the seed drill against the ridges should be adopted. For those with row spacing of one foot to one and a half feet, one to two rows should be added between the rows.

    2. In areas with convenient irrigation conditions or abundant rainfall, the Shandong "nest sowing" method can be adopted. After land preparation, open ditches with a width equal to the row spacing, level the bottom of the ditches, and sow evenly. The row spacing and sowing width are both about six inches.

    3. In the Jiangnan rice area, high ridges should be made before sowing to facilitate drainage. The ridge width should be three feet. If cotton is to be planted after wheat in dryland areas of Jiangnan, three rows of wheat should be sown with a width of five to six inches within a four-foot ridge, with a row spacing of about one foot, and cotton will be planted between the rows at that time.

    4. Changing the sowing method according to the above methods, the sowing amount needs to be increased to 210,000 to 360,000 seeds (approximately 14 to 24 catties). Less should be sown earlier, and more should be sown later; less in dry land and poor soil, and more where soil moisture and fertilizer are sufficient; and more in winter wheat areas that sow varieties with spring sowing characteristics such as Sanba Wheat (i.e., Biyu Wheat, Zhuganqing).

    III. Increase Base Fertilizer Application, Topdressing at the Right Time, and Ensure the Nutrients Required for High Wheat Yield: Currently, wheat fertilization is basically insufficient. All regions are required to formulate specific plans to increase the application of wheat base fertilizer and topdressing based on the current situation, and resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of not fertilizing wheat and blindly over-fertilizing. To obtain high wheat yields, it is necessary to determine reasonable fertilization standards and fertilization times based on soil properties, fertilizer types, and crop growth needs through experiments. Based on general experience, the following principles are proposed:

    1. Applying more organic base fertilizer is a fundamental link in determining wheat yield increase. All regions should vigorously mobilize the masses to raise pigs for manure accumulation, plant green manure, and use human and animal manure and crop straw to make compost, improve manure accumulation methods, and improve fertilizer efficiency. Base fertilizer should be mainly farmyard manure, supplemented with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers to enhance wheat's resistance to cold, rust, and lodging. The amount of base fertilizer applied should be 2,000 to 5,000 catties per mu; the amount can be appropriately increased for fertilizers of poor quality or barren land. The fertilization method is to turn it into the soil when deep plowing before sowing; if bean cake or oil cake is used as base fertilizer, it should be applied in a ditch during sowing, but it must be isolated from the seeds to avoid affecting germination.

    2. Topdressing at the right time according to crop growth needs. Wheat topdressing should generally be applied in two applications. The first time should be before green-up, preferably with decomposed farmyard manure or bean cake, with a dosage of 50 to 100 catties of bean cake per mu as a principle. The second time should be during the booting stage, preferably with fast-acting fertilizers, such as human manure and urine, ammonium sulfate, with a dosage of 15 to 25 catties of ammonium sulfate per mu as a principle. This topdressing must be applied according to the growth of wheat seedlings. More should be applied where wheat seedlings grow poorly, and less should be applied where they grow well.

    3. Universally mobilize the masses to accumulate urine to water wheat to supplement the lack of fertilizer in the later stage of wheat. Urine fertilizer has a relatively high nitrogen content (1,000 catties of urine is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of more than 80 catties of bean cake). When applying, it should be diluted with two or three times the amount of water and poured along the ridges.

    4. Principles for adjusting the amount of fertilizer applied in stages: First, it should be applied according to soil moisture and crop absorption capacity. Generally, more should be applied in irrigated land and less in dry land. Second, it should be based on the fertilizer needs of different varieties. More should be applied for those with high fertilizer requirements, and less should be applied for those with low fertilizer requirements. Third, pay attention to the proper combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. When applying base fertilizer, 20 to 30 catties of bone meal (bone meal should be fermented together with human manure and urine and farmyard manure) and 50 catties of plant ash should generally be added. Fourth, adjust the later stage fertilization according to the amount of fertilizer applied in the early stage and crop growth. If the soil is fertile, the base fertilizer is sufficient, and the wheat grows well, less topdressing can be applied; otherwise, more should be applied. In the acidic soil of Jiangnan, an appropriate amount of lime must be added.

    IV. Select Good Varieties and Sow at the Right Time to Fully Unleash the Potential for Wheat Yield Increase:

    1. To obtain high wheat yields, it is necessary to select high-yielding varieties. In selecting excellent varieties, in the past, attention was only paid to yield, quality, and disease resistance. In the past one or two years, due to the results of high-yield cultivation, the need for varieties with great high-yield potential and non-lodging is even more urgent. The excellent varieties selected by high-yield models in various regions all have the above conditions, so the yield exceeds that of ordinary farmers by one to several times. In addition to implementing the five-year plan for popularizing good varieties, implementing year-by-year ear selection, evaluating excellent varieties, and strengthening good seed breeding, it is also necessary to study the characteristics of good varieties in detail (such as more wheat grains per ear, appropriate tillering ability, uniform growth, strong plants, no diseases and insect pests, etc.) and their cultivation history in order to use various agricultural techniques to fully unleash the potential for high yield of good varieties. The wheat seeds sown in various places are still very mixed, and not enough attention is paid to the storage methods. In the future, seed identification work must be strengthened, stipulating that the mixing rate of good varieties must not exceed 3%, and the germination rate must not be lower than 95%. Sun-drying seeds for five to eight days before sowing to improve their germination rate and viability. In addition, use salt water or mud water to select seeds, remove insect galls and insect eggs, and remove shriveled grains to ensure that the seeds are full and the emergence is uniform. If the grains are uneven and the quality is not uniform, a certain amount of grain selection should be carried out, and large, full, high-quality grains with no surface injuries should be selected for annual breeding and improvement.

    2. Sowing at the right time is to complete wheat tillering and root development before winter and to control its tillering to no more than three to five. Sowing too early is prone to pre-winter jointing, and sowing too late cannot complete tillering and root development before winter. Therefore, ensuring timely sowing and controlling pre-winter wheat tillering is a very important technique in wheat cultivation. The specific time should be determined based on the different climatic conditions and wheat varieties in various regions, and it should generally be appropriately controlled according to local customs. North of Beijing should be sown earlier at the right time. In winter wheat areas, varieties with spring wheat characteristics, such as Biyu Wheat and Bima Wheat, should be sown later at the right time. In the case of fertile soil, sufficient moisture, and increased sowing amount, it should also be sown later at the right time. Dry land and barren areas should be sown earlier at the right time. In order to ensure timely sowing, all regions must pay attention to planting suitable previous crops and making all preparations for sowing in advance. Summer fallow land should be properly cultivated in summer, deep plowed, and moisture conserved. Autumn crops in two-year three-crop areas should be harvested and plowed as early as possible. In the Jiangnan rice area, attention should be paid to drainage after the rice turns yellow to make the soil moderately dry and wet for timely cultivation and sowing.

    V. Master the Amount and Timing of Irrigation: Mastering the amount of irrigation can promote good wheat development, and it is advocated to open ditches between the ridges for immersion irrigation, so that the soil around the plants does not become hardened, which is conducive to the growth of wheat roots and plants, and has the effect of preventing lodging. General experience is to carry out the first irrigation before sowing, and the amount of water should be large, which can ensure good wheat development and smoothly complete pre-winter tillering and root development; when wheat begins to green up in the coming spring, the second irrigation should be carried out, the amount of water should be large, and the time should be early, which can prevent cold and drought and help wheat grow and tiller rapidly; after ten days to half a month, the third irrigation should be carried out according to the weather and soil conditions, and the amount of water can be less than the previous one; after the wheat enters the booting stage, when it is in a vigorous development stage and requires more water, the fourth thorough watering must be carried out in a timely manner to promote wheat heading and flowering; the fifth watering should be carried out when the wheat is filling, and the main function of this watering can make the wheat grains full. After this, the wheat has already formed grains and the ears are heavy. If the soil is too wet, it is easy to lodge, which affects the yield and quality. If it is not too dry, it will no longer be watered. The mastery of the number of irrigations and the amount of water must be determined according to the soil structure and climate and rainfall. Under normal circumstances, water five times according to the above method. If the soil moisture is good, the weather is not too dry, or the water source is insufficient, water can only be done three times (the first, second, and fourth times); if it is sandy soil, the weather is dry, and it is easy to evaporate, the number of irrigations can be appropriately increased.

    VI. Prevention and Control of Diseases and Insect Pests: It is necessary to implement the policy of prevention over treatment and combine the selection of good varieties, improvement of cultivation, and chemical control to comprehensively prevent and control diseases and insect pests. For wheat rust, rust-resistant varieties should be selected, cultivation should be improved to make the plants grow strong, and the damage should be reduced. For wheat scab, variety selection should be combined, sowing time should be appropriately changed, and wheat field drainage work should be done well. In areas where wheat smut is serious, vigorously select seeds, soak seeds, mix seeds, or use manure-seed isolation methods to eliminate wheat smut. In areas where wheat blossom midge is serious, in addition to selecting varieties resistant to wheat blossom midge and promoting rotation, mobilize the masses to pull nets to catch and kill them. In areas where underground pests are serious, vigorously promote chemicals for thorough prevention and control.

    VII. Planting Pasture and Green Manure Crops, Promoting Rational Crop Rotation, and Promoting Grass-Field Rotation System are the best ways to improve soil structure, conserve soil moisture, and increase soil fertility. In many areas, due to continuous wheat cropping, the yield is getting lower and lower. Therefore, in the future, in addition to leading the masses to implement rational crop rotation, we should also vigorously use wasteland to plant purple alfalfa, sophora, alfalfa, sweet clover and other green manure crops, and promote the grass-field rotation system to increase wheat yield per unit area. Farms and agricultural production cooperatives with large land areas in various regions should first try to promote it.

    Note: "Combined plowing" is to use a plow without a moldboard for deep plowing in the front, followed by a plow with a moldboard for deep plowing and turning the soil. Because two plows are used on one ridge at the same time, it is called combined plowing.

    冬小麦丰产技术试行纲要
    中央人民政府农业部
    几年来，各地在小麦生产方面已获得显著的成绩，全国总产量已恢复到战前水平，并在开展爱国丰产评比竞赛运动中涌现出许多高额丰产的模范，创造了很多合乎科学原则的丰产栽培技术；但其中也还存在着许多不合理的现象，因此未能充分发挥小麦增产的潜在能力。为了进一步贯彻中央人民政府政务院所指示的关于农业生产应集中力量提高单位面积产量的方针，特根据各地丰产模范的增产经验，并参照苏联先进科学理论，制定冬小麦丰产技术试行纲要如下：
    一、深耕早耕防旱保墒：深耕是改善土壤结构、提高土壤肥力、保蓄土壤水分的有效措施，并对小麦根系发育及消灭杂草有极大的作用。我国大部产麦地区每年降雨量有二分之一至五分之三，集中在七、八、九三个月，因此，深耕就成为防旱保墒的先决条件。深耕宜早不宜迟，早耕可以延长土壤风化时期，增强土壤蓄水能力；为达到这一目的，必须大力推广新式步犁，组织起来实行细犁套犁
    （注），达到深耕。要求各地在现有基础上普遍加深五分至一寸，深耕标准一般以达到五寸至七寸为原则。
    1．在一年一熟制旱作地区，应充分运用不同的耕地方法接纳伏天雨水。在小麦收获后马上浅耕（用不带犁镜的犁灭茬），雨后再根据深耕标准实行深耕，将作物根、茎和杂草翻入土中，耕后不耙不捞（耱），使翻出来的土壤得到曝晒和风化。此后视降雨与杂草生长情况进行浅耕，至播种前进行最后一次浅耕，深达二、三寸，耕后必须耙耱，使土壤均匀平整。
    2．在两年三作或一年两作地区，夏季应在秋作物田中施行中耕，以接纳伏天雨水；秋作物收后马上顺垅灭茬和耙松土壤，然后根据标准进行深耕，耕后必须耙耱，如距播种时间较长（在播种二、三星期前），争取播种前再浅耕一次。
    3．有些地区农民播种小麦，每隔三、四年用铁锨深翻一次，深达一尺左右，对土壤改良与丰产有极良好的作用。
    4．在干旱地区除注意蓄水防旱外，在冬季要发动群众积雪运冰，增加土壤水分；在江南则应做好排水工作，为小麦生长准备有利条件。
    5．北方早春耙地可减少土壤水分蒸发，使空气流通，有利于土壤中细菌的活动，同时叶上的病菌胞子及虫卵也可以耙去，并能消灭杂草，对麦苗生长极为有利。耙地时间应在春初土壤消冻后马上进行，在耙地前并先施追肥。此后除因施肥、灌水或降雨后需适当中耕松土外，一般无需多锄。
    二、密植：实行密植是充分利用地力，减少土壤水分蒸发及杂草，以达到丰产最有效的措施。目前小麦栽培上主要缺点是行距宽，播幅窄，播种量少；因此，必须缩短行距，加宽播幅，增加播种量，以增加单位面积上的株数。
    1．在条播的地区，一般行距在六寸至八寸者，应采用靠耧并垅办法加宽播幅；行距在一尺至一尺五者，应在行间增加一行至二行。
    2．在灌溉条件方便或雨水较多的地区，可采用山东种窝麦的办法，在整地后开沟，沟宽与行距相等，搂平沟底均匀栽种，行距播幅同为六寸左右。
    3．在江南水稻区，播种前应作高畦以便排水，畦宽以三尺为宜。如江南旱作地区准备麦后植棉者，应在四尺畦内以五、六寸宽幅播种三行小麦，行距约为一尺，届时行间植棉。
    4．根据以上办法改变播种方法，播种量需增加到二十一万粒至三十六万粒（约合十四斤至二十四斤），播种早的应少一些，晚的应多一些；旱地和土壤瘠薄的少一些，土壤水分以及肥料充足的应多
    一些；冬麦区播种带有春播性品种如三八麦（即碧玉麦，竹杆青），应当多一些。
    三、增施基肥，适时追肥，保证小麦丰产所需的养料：目前小麦施肥基本上是不够的，要求各地在现有基础上，定出增施小麦基肥及追肥的具体计划，并坚决消灭种麦不施肥及盲目过多施肥的现象。要获得小麦的丰产必须根据土壤性质、肥料种类及作物生长所需，经过试验，确定合理的施肥标准及施肥时期。现根据一般经验提出如下的原则：
    1．多施有机质基肥，是决定小麦增产的基本环节。各地应大力发动群众养猪积肥，种植绿肥，并用人畜粪便与作物秸秆制造堆肥，改善积肥方法，提高肥料效力。基肥以厩肥为主，并配施磷、钾质肥料，以增强小麦的抗寒、抗锈及抗倒伏等能力。施用基肥数量，要求每亩施到二千斤至五千斤；肥料质量较差或土地瘠薄的，可以适当增加。施肥方法是在播种前深耕时翻入土中；如用豆饼、油饼作基肥，应在播种时开沟施用，但必须与种子隔离，以免影响发芽。
    2．根据作物生长需要适时追肥。小麦追肥一般应分二次施用。第一次在复青前，最好用腐熟的厩肥或豆饼，每亩用量以豆饼五十斤至一百斤为原则。第二次在孕穗期，最好用速效性肥料，如人粪尿、硫酸铵，每亩施用量以硫酸铵十五斤至二十五斤为原则；这次追肥须根据麦苗生长情况施用，麦苗生长不良的地方要多施一些，生长好的地方就少施一些。
    3．普遍发动群众积尿浇麦，以补小麦后期肥料的不足。尿肥含氮量相当高（一千斤尿相当于八十多斤豆饼的肥效），施用时应加水二、三倍稀释后顺垅浇灌。
    4．调节分期施肥数量的原则：第一要根据土壤湿度及作物吸收能力来施。一般水地应多施，旱地应少施。第二要根据品种对肥料需要的特性。需肥多的应多施，需肥少的应少施。第三注意氮、磷、钾三种成分的适当配合。在施基肥时，一般应加施骨粉二、三十斤（骨粉应和人粪尿及厩肥共同发酵），和草木灰五十斤。第四根据前期施肥数量及作物生长情况，调节后期施肥。土壤肥沃，基肥充足，小麦生长良好，追肥就可少施一些，反之就应多施一些，江南酸性土壤须加施适量石灰。
    四、选用良种适期播种，充分发挥小麦增产的潜在能力：
    1、要获得小麦丰产，必须选用丰产品种。在选用优良品种方面，过去只注意产量，品质及抗病能力；近一、二年来由于丰产栽培的结果，对于丰产潜在力大而不倒伏的品种需要更为迫切。各地丰产模范选用的优良品种均具有以上条件，所以产量比一般农民超过一倍至数倍。选用优良品种，除贯彻五年良种普及计划，实行连年穗选，评选优良品种，加强良种繁育以外，并须详细研究良种特性（如每穗麦粒要多，有适当的分蘖能力，生长整齐，植株健壮，无病虫害等），及其栽培的历史条件，以便运用各种农业技术的方法，充分发挥良种丰产的潜在能力。现在各地播种的麦种还很杂，保存的方法注意不够，今后必须加强种子鉴定工作，规定良种夹杂率不得超过百分之三，发芽率不能低于百分之九十五，并在播种前实行晒种五日至八日，以提高其发芽率及生活能力。此外，并用盐水或泥水选种，清除虫瘿、虫卵，捞去秕粒，以保证种子饱满，出苗整齐。如籽粒不匀，品质不齐，应进行一定数量的粒选，要选粒大而饱满的质量好的，表面没有创伤的，以便逐年繁殖提高。
    2．适时播种是为了在冬前完成小麦分蘖及根系的发育，并控制其分蘖不超过三个到五个。播种过早容易发生冬前拔节现象，播种过晚在冬前不能完成分蘖及根系的发育，因此，保证适期播种，控制冬前小麦分蘖，是小麦栽培上一个很重要的技术。具体时间应根据各地气候条件及小麦品种的不同研究确定，一般应以当地习惯适当掌握。北京以北应当适期早播。在冬麦区选用具有春麦性的品种如碧玉麦、碧蚂麦等，应当适期晚播。在土壤肥沃、水分充足、播种量增加的情况下，也应当适期晚播。旱地及瘠薄地区应适期早播。为了保证适期播种，各地须注意种植适宜的前作物，并事前做好播种的一切准备工作。夏季休闲地要作好伏耕、深耕及保墒工作；二年三作区秋作物要尽可能早收早耕；江南水稻区在水稻黄熟后应注意排水，使土壤干湿适度，以便适时耕地播种。
    五、掌握灌水数量及时间：掌握灌水数量可以促进小麦发育优良，并提倡垅间开沟浸浇的办法，不使植株周围土壤板结，利于小麦根系及植株生长，有防止倒伏的功效。一般经验是在播种前进行第一次灌水，水量要大，可以保证小麦发育良好，并顺利完成冬前分蘖及根系发育；来春小麦开始复青时，应浇第二次水，水量宜大，时间宜早，可以防寒防旱，帮助小麦迅速滋长分蘖；过十天至半月应根据天气及土壤情况再浇第三次水，水量可比上一次少些；到小麦孕穗以后，正值发育旺盛，需水较多的时期，须适时浇第四次透水，以促进小麦抽穗开花；到小麦灌浆时浇第五次水，这次水的主要作用可使小麦籽粒饱满。此后小麦已结粒，麦穗沉重，土壤过湿容易倒伏，影响产量及品质，若不太旱便不再浇水。对灌水次数及数量的掌握，须根据土壤结构及气候、雨量情况来决定。一般情况按以上办法浇五次水，如墒土较好，天气不太干旱或水源不足，可以只浇三次水（第一、第二及第四次）；如为沙质土壤，天气干旱，容易蒸发，可以适当增加灌水次数。
    六、防治病虫害：要贯彻防重于治的方针，把选育良种、改善栽培及药剂防治结合起来，全面进行预防及除治。对于小麦锈病，应选用抗锈品种，改善栽培，使植株生长健壮，减轻为害。对小麦赤霉病应结合选种，适当改变播种时期，作好麦田排水工作。小麦黑穗病严重的地区应大力进行选种、浸种、拌种，或用粪种隔离办法，以消灭黑穗病。在小麦吸浆虫严重的地区，除选择抗吸浆虫的品种，提倡轮栽外，应发动群众拉网捕打。在地下害虫严重的地区，应大力推广药剂，彻底防治。
    七、种植牧草及绿肥作物，提倡合理换茬，推广草田轮作制度，是改良土壤结构，保蓄土壤水分，提高土壤肥力的最好办法。不少地区由于小麦连作，产量愈来愈低，因此，今后除领导群众实行合理换茬外，并应大力利用荒地，种植紫穗槐、苦豆子、紫苜蓿、草木樨等绿肥作物，推广草田轮作制度，以提高小麦单位面积产量。各地农场与土地面积较多的农业生产合作社，应首先试办推广。
    注：“套犁”是用不带犁镜的犁在前深耕，接着后面用带犁镜的犁深耕翻土。因同时用两犋犁在一条垅上耕，所以叫套犁。
