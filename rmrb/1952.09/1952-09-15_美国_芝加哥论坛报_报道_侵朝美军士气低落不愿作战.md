Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 14th. TASS dispatch from New York on the 10th: The U.S. "Chicago Tribune" observer, Simmons, reported on the morale of U.S. troops in Korea, stating that the dissatisfaction within the United States regarding the Korean War is reflected in the morale at the front lines. It is common that soldiers refuse to fight. For weeks, when orders are given to fight, some soldiers refuse. They believe it is meaningless to die in this way. Simmons said: On one occasion, soldiers of the U.S. 7th Division were "so frightened that they were dazed" and even abandoned their wounded comrades.

    侵朝美军士气低落不愿作战
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约十日讯：美国“芝加哥论坛报”观察员西蒙斯报道朝鲜美军士气说，美国国内对朝鲜战争的不满反映在前线的士气上。常常有这种情形：士兵们拒绝作战。数星期来，当有命令要打仗时，就有一些士兵拒绝作战。他们认为这样送死是无意义的。西蒙斯说：有一次美军第七师的士兵“因吓得发昏”，竟连受伤的同伴都抛弃了。
