    Further Develop the Full Load, Over-Axle, 500-Kilometer Movement

    The full load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement launched by the national railways is developing vigorously at an unprecedented speed.

    In the past three months, the existing technical norms have been broken through, and the rate of increase in several indicators has been very rapid. For example, comparing the indicators for the first quarter of this year with those for the fourth quarter of last year, the daily locomotive mileage only increased by 10.8 kilometers, the average total weight of trains only increased by 6.4 tons, and the average monthly production ton-kilometers of freight locomotives only increased by 6,906 ton-kilometers. However, comparing the figures for May, June, and July of this year with those for the first quarter, the daily locomotive mileage increased by 35.5 kilometers, the average total weight of trains increased by 196.8 tons, and the average monthly production ton-kilometers of freight locomotives increased by over 119,000 ton-kilometers. Because various indicators have risen rapidly, and with the improvement of various aspects of work before May, railway transportation capacity has significantly improved compared to the past. Within three months, not only did the number of loaded cars increase by 12.3 percent and the tons of goods dispatched increase by 15.2 percent compared to the same period last year, but there was also a large amount of remaining transportation capacity. If there is sufficient cargo and shippers submit their consignment plans in a timely manner, it is estimated that the fourth quarter of this year may be able to transport a quarter more goods than July of this year.

    In addition, because of the promotion of various advanced methods, a high tide of technical learning has begun to form among the vast number of employees. As of July, 47 percent of dispatchers and a quarter of locomotive crew members had been trained; most railway employees are enthusiastically learning various advanced methods. Due to the increased proficiency of workers' skills, some technical and organizational problems that had not been resolved for a long time in the past have now been successfully resolved. For example, the traction tonnage of 34 large slopes across the country has been increased, and 74 types of traction norms have been reduced to 29. The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge will soon be able to run large locomotives at a faster speed. Workers' creativity has also increased unprecedentedly. Yang Maolin has created a method of picking up and delivering cars according to number; Li Xikui's shunting method has a new development—the implementation of high-tech shunting; Guo Chunlin's new road maintenance method has been recognized as the national road maintenance banner.

    Reasons for obtaining these achievements: First, on the basis of the "Three Antis" movement, conservatism and departmentalism have been systematically criticized. Soviet experts played a significant role in technical and theoretical guidance on this ideological front, and the advanced standards created by advanced individuals played a decisive role. Technical personnel's thinking has also undergone great changes, and there have been new achievements in the combination of labor and technology. Second, the widespread establishment of small group competition conditions and production increase and thrift plans has played a significant role in deepening and improving the movement. All groups with better performance first improved their understanding of production increase and thrift from a political and economic perspective, then launched criticisms, exposed problems in business management and technical operations, and tapped potential to find solutions, formulating practical and feasible specific plans. By June, 6,831 production teams across the railway had responded to the challenge from Zheng Xikun's chartered train team. According to statistics from the Changchun, Jilin, and Andong Railway Administrations alone, 10,497 teams had established production increase and thrift plans, reaching 87 percent of all teams. The number of rationalization proposals put forward was 2.92 times that of the same period last year. Third, the Sino-Soviet Railway played a leading and exemplary role in all aspects, which had a great impact on various bureaus. Soviet experts within the ministry also provided great assistance on several key issues. Fourth, the guiding ideology of focusing on promoting advanced working methods has been clarified among the main leading cadres, and large-scale technical training work will soon begin in various bureaus. Fifth, all cadres worked together and basically implemented the guiding principles for leading the movement.

    The main contradiction of the current movement, that is, the fundamental shortcomings of the leadership, is that the backwardness of enterprise management is incompatible with the enthusiasm and creativity of the working masses. Although some reforms in production management have been carried out in the past three months, such as formulating tight operating schedules, balancing locomotive traction norms, and promulgating new station technical operating procedures, they are still far from meeting the needs of the movement and the demands of the masses. For example, the organization and command of train operations have not been thoroughly reformed; the piece-rate wage system and reward methods have not been fully implemented; the phenomenon of overtime has not been overcome; safety, sanitation, and labor protection have not been well improved; various production quotas have not been scientifically verified; and the creativity of the masses has not been fully collected and transformed into technical guidance documents. Of course, these many reforms in production management are piled up together, and neither time nor energy can solve them all at once. Only by grasping one center within a certain period and placing other work in a subordinate position around one center can they be solved. Before the end of this year, we should concentrate our efforts on thoroughly promoting various advanced methods. Everyone must master more than one advanced method, and must ensure that everyone understands, everyone can do, and everyone is qualified. According to the development of the situation, at an appropriate time, combined with the promotion of advanced methods, we will use simple and easy-to-implement scientific methods to universally conduct verification work on technical norms and raw material consumption standards in order to lay the foundation for the implementation and implementation of economic accounting systems.

    Another major shortcoming in the three-month full load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement is the serious formalism that has emerged. In the work of promoting advanced experience, many places talk more and do less, and engage in grandstanding rather than being down-to-earth. Accidents have increased, reaching 737 in June. Although they have decreased in July, they are still serious; this is because of poor discipline education, poor technical inspection, violations of rules and regulations, and excessive fatigue of employees in individual cases. The number of single locomotives has increased, with the national average increasing by 1.4 percent in July compared to June. The Hengyang Railway Administration was 8.2 percent in June, and increased to 10 percent in July. The phenomenon of falsely reporting achievements is still serious. Comparing the precise statistics and business statistics for June, the Jilin Railway Administration over-reported the daily locomotive mileage by 31.6 kilometers, and the Jinzhou Railway Administration over-reported by 26.1 kilometers. The Tianjin Railway Administration over-reported the average total weight of trains by 35.5 tons. The production increase and thrift plans of the groups also have formalism. For example, the results of inspections by the Qiqihar Railway Administration found that 32 percent were formalistic, and this phenomenon is common in other bureaus. The root cause of formalism is first and foremost the bureaucracy of leading cadres. The emergence of bureaucracy is due, on the one hand, to too many tasks, and on the other hand, to the failure to grasp the central link and distinguish between the importance and urgency, organize forces, and thus form a passive leadership work without in-depth inspection work. Secondly, some cadres have a mentality of loving greatness and seeking success, one-sidedly pursuing the rise of technical indicators without studying their economic effects. Thirdly, changes in car flow and cargo flow, poor technical and organizational work, etc.

    These are the two main shortcomings that hinder the in-depth development of the full load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement.

    To overcome the above shortcomings, the first is to improve leadership methods and improve the organizational capacity of cadres. The current task should be to focus on the implementation of tight operating schedules, and deploy the work of various departments and organizations in a rhythmic and coordinated manner. Secondly, we must conduct strict inspection work level by level from bottom to top, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against all phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline that violate transportation discipline, violate rules and regulations, and fail to execute orders and instructions. Thirdly, the entire railway should well implement Sudnikov's comprehensive dispatching method and comprehensively reform the organization of train operations in order to reduce single locomotive travel and improve the utilization efficiency of locomotives and vehicles. In addition to this, it is also necessary to vigorously improve workers' working conditions and living conditions, implement piece-rate wage systems and reward systems as soon as possible, adjust labor organization to overcome overtime, and conduct a general inspection of safety, sanitation, and labor protection. As long as the above work is done well, the full load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement will receive even greater achievements.

    进一步开展满载、超轴、五百公里运动
    全国铁路所开展的满载、超轴、五百公里运动，正以空前的速度，朝气勃勃地发展着。
    三个月来，现行的技术定额已被突破，其中若干指标的上升速度是很快的。例如：今年第一季度的指标与去年第四季度的相比较，机车日车公里仅提高十点八公里，列车平均总的重量仅提高六点四吨，货物机车每月平均生产吨公里提高六千九百零六吨公里；而今年五、六、七月份的与第一季度相比较，则机车日车公里提高三十五点五公里，列车平均总的重量提高一百九十六点八吨，货物机车每月平均生产吨公里提高十一万九千余吨公里。因为各种指标迅速上升，和五月以前各方面工作的改进，铁路运输能力较过去显著提高了。三个月内不仅较去年同一时期装车数提高了百分之十二点三，货物发送吨数提高了百分之十五点二，而且还有大量剩余的运输能力。如果货源充足、货主及时提出托运计划，估计今年第四季度有可能比今年七月份多运四分之一的货物。
    此外，因为各种先进方法的推广，在广大员工中开始形成学习技术的高潮。截止七月份已有百分之四十七的调度人员和四分之一的机车乘务员经过训练；大多数铁路员工都热情地学习着各种先进方法。由于工人技术熟练程度的提高，有些过去长期未能解决的技术上和组织上的问题，现在都顺利地解决了。例如全国有三十四处大坡道的牵引吨数提高了，七十四种牵引定数已减少到二十九种，郑州黄河大桥不久即可以很快的速度走行冖ㄎ1大型机车。工人的创造也比过去空前的增多了，杨茂林又创造了对号取送车法；李锡奎的调车法又有新发展——实行了高技术溜放法；郭春林的新养路法已公认为全国的养路旗帜。
    获得成绩的原因：第一、在“三反”运动的基础上系统地批判了保守主义和本位主义思想，在这条思想战线上苏联专家在技术理论上的指导起了很大作用，先进的人物所创造的先进标准起了决定性的作用。技术人员的思想也有很大改变，劳动与技术相结合有了新的成就。第二、普遍订立小组竞赛条件和增产节约计划，对运动的深入和提高起了重大作用。凡成绩较好的小组，都是由于首先从政治、经济意义上提高了对增产节约的认识，进而开展批评，揭发经营管理和技术作业等方面的问题，并挖潜力找窍门，订出切实可行的具体计划。全路到六月止已有六千八百三十一个生产小组向郑锡坤包车组应了战。仅中长、吉林两管理局和安东分局的统计，有一万零四百九十七个小组订立了增产节约计划，达全部小组的百分之八十七。提出的合理化建议相当于去年同时期的二点九二倍。第三、中长路在各方面起了带头作用和示范作用，对各局影响很大。部内的苏联专家也在若干关键性的问题上给了很大帮助。第四、以推广先进工作方法为中心的领导思想，在主要领导干部中间是明确起来了，大规模的技术训练工作各局即将开始。第五、全体干部一致努力，基本上贯彻了对运动的领导方针。
    目前运动的主要矛盾，即领导方面的根本缺点是：企业经营管理的落后性和工人群众的积极性创造性不相适应。虽然三个月来也进行了一些生产管理的改革工作，如制定紧密运行图，平衡机车的牵引定数，颁布了新的车站技术作业过程，但与运动的需要和群众的要求还相距甚远。例如，行车的组织工作、指挥工作还没彻底改革；计件工资制和奖励办法还没全面实行；加班加点现象还没克服；安全卫生、劳动保护也没很好的改善；各种生产定额还没有经过科学的查定；群众的创造还没全面的集中起来变成技术指导的文件。当然这许多生产管理的改革工作积压在一起，不论时间和精力都不是一下子可以解决的，只有在一定时期内抓住一个中心，把其他工作放在协从的地位围绕着一个中心去解决。今年年底以前，应集中精力彻底推广各种先进方法，每一个人都必须掌握一种以上的先进方法，务必作到人人懂得、人人会作、人人合格。根据情况的发展，在适当时机内结合着先进方法的推广工作，采用简便易行而又合乎科学的方法，普遍进行技术定额和原材料消耗标准的查定工作，以便为实行和贯彻经济核算制打下基础。
    三个月满载、超轴、五百公里运动中的另一个重大缺点，就是产生了严重的形式主义。推广先进经验的工作，不少地方是喊的多做的少，不是踏踏实实而是虚张声势。事故增多，六月份曾达七百三十七件，七月份虽已减少，但仍然严重；这是因为纪律教育太差，技术检查不良，违犯规章制度和个别情况下员工疲劳过度所致。单机增加，全国平均七月份比六月份增加百分之一点四。衡阳铁路管理局六月份是百分之八点二，七月份增加到百分之十。伪报成绩的现象依然严重。以六月份的精密统计和业务统计相比较，吉林铁路管理局多报货物机车日车公里三十一点六公里，锦州铁路管理局多报二十六点一公里。天津铁路管理局多报列车平均总重三十五点五吨。小组的增产节约计划也有形式主义的，如齐齐哈尔铁路管理局检查的结果，发现有百分之三十二是形式的，这种现象在其他局也普遍存在。产生形式主义的根本原因，首先是领导干部的官僚主义。官僚主义的产生，一方面是因为任务太多，另一方面是没有抓住中心环节和分别轻重缓急，组织力量，因而形成领导工作的被动，没有深入检查工作。其次是某些干部有好大喜功的思想，片面地追逐技术指标的上升，不研究他的经济效果如何。再次是车流货流变化，技术和组织工作不良等。
    这就是阻碍满载、超轴、五百公里运动深入发展的两个主要缺点。
    要克服上述缺点，首先是改进领导方法，提高干部的组织能力。当前的任务应当是围绕着贯彻执行紧密运行图为中心，有节奏地协调地部署各个部门各个组织的工作。其次，要自下而上地逐级进行严格的检查工作，向一切破坏运输纪律、违犯规章制度不执行命令、指示等无组织无纪律现象进行不调和的斗争。再次，全路应很好推行苏德尼果夫的综合调度法，全面的改革行车的组织工作，以减少单机走行和提高机车车辆的运用效率。除此而外，还要大力改进工人的劳动条件和生活状况，尽快地实行计件工资制和奖励制度，调整劳动组织克服加班加点现象，并普遍地进行安全卫生和劳动保护的大检查等。只要把上述工作作好，满载、超轴、五百公里运动将会收到更大的成绩。
