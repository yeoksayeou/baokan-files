    National agricultural activities are about to enter the most intense season of the year. Recently, the Central Ministry of Agriculture issued the "Notice on Launching the Autumn Crop Bumper Harvest Appraisal Movement," published the "Opinions on Launching the 1953 Wheat Patriotic Bumper Harvest Competition," and today promulgated the "Interim Measures for Rewarding Agricultural Bumper Harvests in 1952" and will announce guiding documents on winter wheat bumper harvest technology. The central purpose of these documents is to encourage the peasant masses to summarize and promote advanced bumper harvest experiences and agricultural science and technology in order to further increase unit area yield.
    This year is the year when China's agricultural production has basically completed its recovery and is moving towards a stage of development. Under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels and the people's governments at all levels, farmers in various parts of China have organized themselves in various forms and launched a large-scale and rich patriotic production increase competition movement. From the summer harvest to now, news of bumper harvests has been frequently reported: Although winter wheat and spring wheat suffered from natural disasters, the total national output still increased by 16.7 percent compared to last year; early rice and mid-season rice have also increased compared to last year; the growth of late rice, millet, soybeans, sorghum, corn, etc. is generally good. Cotton is also generally growing very vigorously, and it is expected that the production increase task can also be completed. Last year, China's total cotton output had already exceeded the pre-War of Resistance level; judging from all aspects, this year China's total grain output can also break through the pre-War of Resistance level.
    We are delighted and encouraged by this year's bumper harvest; but we must recognize that the level we are about to reach and break through is the level of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal era – a very pitiful and backward level. Merely recovering to or partially exceeding this level is far from enabling farmers to completely escape poverty, and it is far from meeting the needs of large-scale national construction. China's large-scale economic construction is about to begin. Large-scale economic construction requires the agricultural front to supply more industrial raw materials and grain. This is the basic task on the agricultural production front.
    Is it possible to raise the existing agricultural production level a step further under the circumstances that industry cannot supply agriculture with a large number of machines and agricultural production materials cannot be greatly changed? Our answer is that it is entirely possible. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that land reform is a revolution, and organizing is another revolution. Both of these revolutions can increase productivity and increase production. Our organization is still based on existing production tools or slightly improved tools, not on machines. Therefore, it can be affirmed that as long as the degree of organization continues to improve, agricultural productivity will inevitably continue to improve. This view must first be clearly affirmed. In our agricultural production, there is still great potential hidden, and there are still many production increase factors that can be used under the current conditions that have not been fully utilized. This potential is most obviously manifested in the fact that, under similar natural conditions and with the same agricultural tools, there is a large gap between the lowest yield and the average yield of farmland, as well as between the average yield and the highest yield. Now, the basic conditions for further developing these potential capabilities are already available. As long as we master and improve agricultural technology on the basis of organization, output can be greatly increased. According to the estimate of Soviet agricultural expert Lysenko, the state and farmers do not need to make any additional investment. As long as reasonable close planting is implemented, China's wheat output can increase by 15 billion jin per year; cotton can increase by 10 to 15 percent as long as seedlings are appropriately thinned. Therefore, in addition to leading farmers to continue to advance on the road of organization, improving technology is currently crucial for further improving China's agricultural level.
    In the case of a great shortage of technical personnel, the most important way to improve farming technology is to lead the peasant masses to universally summarize bumper harvest experiences; summarize on one hand, promote on the other, and improve on the other.
    Is this possible? It can be said that in most places, as long as farmers are organized and do it seriously, it is possible. We already have the conditions to summarize and promote advanced experience more universally. First of all, in the process of restoring production, the peasant masses have already created many valuable bumper harvest experiences, but very few have been summarized. Secondly, we have tried to summarize and promote some bumper harvest experiences since last autumn; some of these preliminary summarized experiences have been tested in this year's production practice, and we have also gained some basic experiences and lessons in summarizing and promoting bumper harvest experiences. Moreover, these preliminary summarized experiences have had obvious effects in the areas where they have been implemented, and many peasant masses have begun to be interested in bumper harvest experiences, and conservative ideas have begun to be broken. On this basis, it is entirely possible to launch a mass movement to summarize bumper harvest experiences.
    How to mobilize and lead the peasant masses to summarize and promote bumper harvest experiences? The most effective method is to launch an appraisal movement. This appraisal movement should first focus on summarizing the production experience of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, which is also the direction of our agricultural production. The process of the bumper harvest appraisal movement is also the process of summarizing and promoting advanced experience and overcoming conservative ideas. The appraisal must not be carried out only by a few cadres, but must be a mass movement. Only in this way can the leadership absorb more of the practical experience and lessons of the masses, and summarize the general laws from the rich and diverse special laws. More importantly, only in this way can the masses learn to consciously summarize production experience, and spread advanced experience to the masses in the process of appraisal and summarization. These experiences are seen by the local masses with their own eyes, so they are most easily accepted by the masses. These experiences may not be very systematic, not very comprehensive, and not entirely in line with science; even so, they are still very useful. If the farmers in each village can learn the best experience within the scope of a village and look up to the highest yield in a village, the effect produced nationwide will be very considerable.
    In order to make the preliminary bumper harvest experience summarized by the peasant masses more systematic and scientific, the agricultural science and technology leading organs have the responsibility to combine the mass appraisal from bottom to top with the scientific guidance from top to bottom. On the one hand, strive to popularize scientific theory among the masses and constantly enrich it; on the other hand, constantly use scientific theory to summarize the bumper harvest experience of the masses and constantly improve it. In the process of carrying out this work, we must adhere to a strict scientific attitude, conduct in-depth investigations and specific analyses, and must not pretend to understand or make far-fetched associations. For example, some cadres, as soon as they hear about advocating close planting, say that some phenomena unrelated to reasonable close planting are also caused by reasonable close planting, and regard more tillering of wheat as a result of close planting; this violates the scientific principle of seeking truth from facts.
    Whether it is leading mass appraisal and summarization or conducting more systematic scientific summarization, we should not only pay attention to the experience of creating new records of high yields, but also pay more attention to the experience of large-scale universal production increase. In the past, we have focused on summarizing the experience of creating new records of high yields, which is necessary; this has played a great role in breaking conservative ideas and eliminating production increase concerns. This kind of experience will still need to be summarized in the future; but this alone is not enough. The basic principles for achieving high yields on small plots of land are naturally also applicable on large areas of land; but large-scale universal production increase has more problems to be solved. We must oppose only paying attention to high yields on small plots of land and not paying attention to how to universally increase yields, because this will only fuel the tendency of championshipism; it may even develop some fake labor heroes, which is harmful to production and contrary to the direction of collectivism.
    The autumn harvest is about to begin universally. We should seize the opportunity to launch an appraisal movement and make a mass summary of the bumper harvest experience of various major autumn crops. Regarding the bumper harvest experience of wheat this year, various places have already made some summaries under leadership. Those that have not yet been summarized should be supplemented; those that have not been summarized well should also pay attention to improvement, and strive to improve the record-style summary into a more scientific summary through analysis and research. This winter, various places will hold labor model conferences, which should also focus on summarizing and promoting bumper harvest experiences.
    Winter wheat will soon be sown. Various places should, based on the experiences that can be affirmed, transform the unquestionable principles of deep plowing, rational fertilization, seed selection and soaking, close planting, etc. into concrete measures suitable for local conditions, and earnestly promote them to the masses.
    The broad masses of peasants now urgently demand technical guidance. However, some cadres doing rural work still do not pay enough attention to technology. They abstract political leadership, thinking that with politics there is everything, and do not see the important role of technology in ensuring political leadership under certain conditions. They do not understand technology and do not learn, so they cannot lead farmers to improve technology, and the result will inevitably be separation from the masses. The conservative ideas of rural cadres and farmers are also to some extent a reflection of the lack of technology and long-term backwardness of production; to break the conservative idea of "reaching the peak of production increase," we must promote advanced experience and science and technology. The process of launching the patriotic production increase movement is the process of patriotism, collectivism, and individualism fighting each other, and it is the process of advanced scientific production methods and backward conservative production methods fighting each other. We should take summarizing and promoting advanced bumper harvest experiences and science and technology, and universally increasing unit area yield, as the central content of the patriotic production increase competition. Only by grasping this main link can we do a good job in the autumn harvest and autumn planting, and strive for a greater harvest next year.

### 总结和推广今年的丰产经验争取明年更大的丰收

    总结和推广今年的丰产经验争取明年更大的丰收
    全国各地农事活动就要进入一年之中最紧张的季节了。最近，中央农业部发出了“关于开展秋季作物丰产评比运动的通知”，发表了“关于开展一九五三年小麦爱国丰产竞赛的意见”，今天又颁布了“一九五二年农业丰产奖励暂行办法”，并将公布关于冬小麦丰产技术的指导性文件。这些文件的中心目的是鼓励农民群众总结、推广先进丰产经验和农业科学技术，以便进一步提高单位面积产量。
    今年是我国的农业生产基本上完成恢复工作并已走向发展阶段的一年。我国各地农民在中国共产党的各级组织和各级人民政府的领导和帮助下，用各种形式组织起来，开展了规模巨大、内容丰富的爱国增产竞赛运动。从夏收到现在，丰收的喜讯频传：冬小麦和春小麦虽然遭受了自然灾害的袭击，但全国总产量仍比去年增加了百分之十六点七；早稻、中稻也都比去年增加了；晚稻、谷子（粟）、大豆、高粱、玉米等的生长情况普遍良好。棉花一般也都生长得很茁壮，预计也可完成增产任务。去年，我国的棉花总产量就已经超过了抗战以前的水平；就各方面的情况来看，今年我国的粮食总产量也可以突破抗战以前的水平。
    我们为今年的丰收而欢欣鼓舞；但是必须认识，我们刚要达到和突破的水平是半殖民地半封建时代的水平——很可怜很落后的水平。仅仅恢复到或者部分地超过了这种水平，还远远不能使农民完全摆脱穷困的状态，还远远不能满足国家大规模建设的需要。我国大规模的经济建设就要开始了。大规模的经济建设，要求农业战线供给更多的工业原料和粮食。这是农业生产战线上的基本任务。
    在工业还不可能供给农业以大量的机器、农业生产资料还不可能有很大的改变的情况下，把现有的农业生产水平提高一步是否可能呢？我们的回答是完全可以作到的。毛主席早已指出，土地改革是一个革命，组织起来又是一个革命。这两个革命都能提高生产力，增加生产。我们的组织起来，还是建筑在现有的生产工具或稍加改良的工具的基础上的，还不是建筑在机器的基础上的。因此，可以肯定只要组织起来的程度继续提高，农业的生产力必然继续提高。这一观点必须首先明确地肯定下来。在我们的农业生产中，还潜藏着很大的力量，还有许多在现在的条件下可以利用的增产因素没有被充分利用。这种潜力最明显地表现在自然条件相近、所用农具相同的情况下，农田最低产量和平均产量之间以及平均产量和最高产量之间有很大的距离。现在，进一步发挥这些潜在能力的基本条件是已经具备了，只要在组织起来的基础上，掌握和提高农业技术，产量就能大大地提高。据苏联农学专家卢森科估计，国家及农民不必再加任何投资，只要实行合理密植，我国小麦产量每年就可增加一百五十亿斤；棉花只要适当地间苗定苗，就可以增加百分之十至十五的产量。因此，除了领导农民在组织起来的道路上继续前进之外，改进技术在当前对于进一步提高我国的农业水平具有决定性的作用。
    在技术人员非常缺乏的情况下，改进耕作技术最主要的办法就是领导农民群众普遍进行丰产经验的总结；一面总结、一面推广、一面提高。
    这是不是能够做得到？可以说，在绝大部分地方，只要组织农民，认真地去做，都是可以做得到的。我们已经有了比较普遍地总结和推广先进经验的条件。首先，在恢复生产的过程中，农民群众已经创造了不少宝贵的丰产经验，只是很少经过总结。其次，我们从去年秋天开始，已经试行总结和推广过一些丰产经验；这些初步总结的经验已有一些在今年的生产实践中经过了考验，我们也从中取得了总结和推广丰产经验的若干基本经验和教训。而且，这些初步总结的经验，在已经推行了的地区都发生了明显的效果，许多农民群众对于丰产经验已经开始感到兴趣，保守思想开始打破。在这样的基础上，开展一个群众性的总结丰产经验的运动是完全可能的。
    怎样发动和领导农民群众总结和推广丰产经验呢？最有效的方法就是开展评比运动。这一评比运动，应首先着重总结互助组和农业生产合作社的生产经验，也是我们农业生产的方向。丰产评比运动的过程，也就是总结和推广先进经验的过程和克服保守思想的过程。评比决不能只是由少数几个干部来进行，而必须是一个群众性的运动。只有这样，领导方面才能更多地吸收群众的实际的经验和教训，从丰富的多样的特殊的规律中，总结出一般的规律。更重要的是，只有这样，才能使群众学会自觉地总结生产经验，并且在评比总结的过程中就把先进的经验传播到群众中去。这些经验是当地群众亲眼看到的，因之最容易为群众所接受。这些经验可能不太系统、不太全面、不完全合乎科学；即使如此，也还是很有用的。如果每个村子的农民都能学到一村范围之内最好的经验，向一村的最高产量看齐，在全国来说产生的效果就会是非常可观的。
    为了使农民群众初步总结的丰产经验更加系统化、科学化，农业科学技术领导机关有责任把自下而上的群众性的评比和自上而下的科学的指导结合起来。一方面力求把科学理论普及到群众中去，使它不断充实；一方面要经常运用科学理论总结群众的丰产经验，使它不断提高。在进行这个工作的过程时，一定要抱着严格的科学态度，进行深入调查和具体分析，决不可不懂装懂或牵强附会。如有的干部一听说提倡密植，就把一些和合理密植无关的现象也说是由于合理密植而发生的，把小麦分蘖多也当作是密植的结果；这是违背实事求是的科学原则的。
    不论是领导群众性的评比总结还是进行更加系统化的科学的总结，都不应当只注意创造高额产量新纪录的经验，而更要注意大面积普遍增产的经验。过去我们曾着重总结了创造高额产量新纪录的经验，这是必要的；这对于打破保守思想、扫除增产顾虑起了很大的作用。今后也还需要总结这种经验；但仅仅这样就不够了。在小片土地上取得高额产量的基本原则，在大面积土地上自然也是适用的；但大面积的普遍增产还有更多的问题需要解决。必须反对只是注意小片土地的高额产量，而不注意如何普遍提高产量，因为这只会助长锦标主义的倾向；甚至发展一些假劳动英雄，对生产是有害的，这和集体主义的方向是相违背的。
    秋收快要普遍开始了。我们应当抓紧时机，开展评比运动，把各种主要秋季作物的丰产经验作一次群众性的总结。对于今年小麦的丰产经验，各地已经有领导地作了一些总结，还没有总结的，应当补作；总结得不好的，还应注意改进，力求把记录式的总结经过分析研究提高为比较科学的总结。今冬各地举行劳动模范大会，也应以总结和推广丰产经验为主要内容。
    冬小麦很快就要播种了。各地应当根据已经可以肯定的经验，把关于深耕、合理施肥、选种浸种、密植等不容置疑的原则，化为适合当地情况的具体措施，认真推广到群众中去。
    广大农民现在迫切要求技术指导。可是，有些做农村工作的干部对于技术仍然没有给以足够的重视。他们把政治领导抽象化了，认为有了政治就有了一切，而看不到在一定条件下技术对于保证政治领导的重大作用。他们不懂技术也不学习，因此就不可能领导农民改进技术，结果就必然是脱离群众。农村干部和农民的保守思想在一定程度上也是技术缺乏和生产长期落后的反映；要打破“增产到顶”的保守思想，就必须推广先进经验和科学技术。开展爱国增产运动的过程，就是爱国主义、集体主义和个人主义进行斗争的过程，就是先进的科学的生产方法和落后的保守的生产方法进行斗争的过程。我们应当把总结和推广先进丰产经验和科学技术、普遍提高单位面积产量，作为爱国增产竞赛的中心内容。只有抓紧这个主要环节，才能把秋收、秋种工作做好，才能争取明年的更大丰收。
