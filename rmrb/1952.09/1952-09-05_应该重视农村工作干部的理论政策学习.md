    The Theoretical and Policy Study of Rural Work Cadres Should Be Emphasized

    Editor: Currently, there is an undesirable tendency among some comrades doing rural work in some areas, namely, a lack of study. The atmosphere for studying theories and policies is very weak, resulting in a very low level of theoretical and policy understanding for some comrades. For example, when the Sixth District of You County, Hunan, held an enlarged cadre meeting in mid-June, it conducted a test. Among the fifty-two participants, forty-eight submitted their papers. Only nine passed, thirty-nine failed, the average score was thirty-nine points, the highest was eighty-four points, and the lowest was only two points. The test questions consisted of nine questions on production policies and three current affairs questions. Among them, only sixteen people correctly answered the question about the future direction of rural development, and the rest were incorrect. Many comrades did not thoroughly understand the basic spirit and content of the "Ten Major Agricultural Production Policies for 1952" promulgated by the Central South Military and Political Committee.

    I believe the above situation is very serious. As a working cadre, how can one do a good job and lead the peasants forward if one knows so little about basic theories and policies and is unclear about the direction of rural development?

    The basic reason for the low level of theoretical and policy understanding is the neglect of studying theories and policies. This spring, when I went to western Hunan to participate in land reform work, I saw with my own eyes that some district governments subscribed to many newspapers, but few comrades read them; some were still brand new and untouched, placed in the corner. Some comrades said to me: "We are too busy to read." I don't think this is the main reason. The main reason is that some comrades have a sense of pride and complacency, and they have a perfunctory attitude towards work, believing that they have been working in rural areas for a long time and have a set of experiences that can cope with the current work, so they do not work hard to study.

    Of course, in order for rural work comrades to carry out theoretical and policy study well, in addition to relying on their own initiative and efforts, the attention and help of leaders at all levels is very important. I suggest that the leading departments formulate a set of feasible systems for the study of rural work cadres, so that cadres can study regularly, or adopt the method of rotational study. At the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to timely pointing out ideological or learning biases, introducing experiences, and carrying out commendations and criticisms, so as to continuously improve the theoretical and policy level of cadres and ensure the smooth completion of tasks.

### 应该重视农村工作干部的理论政策学习

    应该重视农村工作干部的理论政策学习
    编辑同志：目前，在有些地区做农村工作的同志中间，存在着一种不良的倾向，就是不学习。理论政策的学习空气很薄弱，以致有些同志的理论政策水平就非常低。如湖南攸县六区在六月中旬开扩大干部会时，曾举行一次测验，参加测验的有五十二人，交卷的四十八人，及格的九人，不及格的三十九人，平均分数为三十九分，最多的八十四分，最少的就只有二分。所测验的题目是生产政策占九题，时事问答三题。其中对今后农村发展的方向问题，只有十六人答对了，其余的都不对，许多同志对中南军政委员会所颁布的一九五二年农业生产十大政策的基本精神和内容，懂得极不透彻。
    上述情况我认为是很严重的。作为一个工作干部，连基本的理论政策都很少懂得，农村发展方向也不明确，又怎样能够搞好工作、领导农民前进呢？
    理论政策水平低的基本原因就是由于忽视了对理论政策的学习。我今春到湘西参加土地改革工作，亲眼看到有些区政府报纸订得很多，但很少有同志去看；有的还是崭新的、原封未动的摆在墙角上。有的同志对我说：“工作忙，没时间看。”我觉得这不是主要原因，主要的还是有些同志存在着骄傲自满情绪，对工作抱着应付的态度，认为自己在农村工作很久了，有了一套经验，可以应付当前的工作，因此就不努力学习。
    当然，农村工作同志要能很好的进行理论政策的学习，除了靠自己主动努力外，各级领导部门的重视和帮助是十分重要的。我建议领导部门对农村工作干部的学习能订出一套可行的制度，使干部能定期学习，或采取轮番学习的办法。同时必须注意及时指出思想上或学习上的偏向，介绍经验，进行表扬和批评，这样才能使干部的理论政策水平不断的提高，保证任务顺利完成。
