    Taiyuan City Factories and Mines' Party Building Experience
    Xu Zhenhai
    I.
    After leading the various factories in completing the democratic reforms and concluding the "Three-Anti" movement, the Party organizations in factories and mines in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, admitted a large number of advanced workers into the Party around July 1st. Among them were labor models, as well as learning and work models. The admission of these outstanding members of the industrial workers into the Party has not only directly promoted the current increase production and practice economy campaign, but also prepared the conditions for the new production tasks of the factories and mines. II. As soon as the Party building work in the factories and mines was arranged, the workers began to "read the Party Constitution, study the Eight Articles," and competed to sign up for Party classes. This shows that the conditions for our Party building are very good.
    However, there is still a distance between the ideological level of the activists and the level of a Communist Party member. According to the analysis of the ideological situation of the activists who can be developed as objects, except for a part of the activists who have a relatively clear understanding of the conditions of Party members, the general ones only express their determination to be a Party member, but their basic knowledge of the Party is still quite lacking, and even have wrong understandings of the Party. For example: They admit that the Communist Party is the party of the working class, but their understanding of the class nature of the Party is unclear, and they doubt why the Party organization "does not have a share for farmers"; they understand that "the New Democratic society is good, and the socialist society is even better," but their understanding of the superiority of public ownership is insufficient; their concept of supporting the Party and following the Party is very clear, but their concept of fighting for the cause of the Party for life is quite vague; they are active and responsible in their work and can play a personal role, but their understanding of the principle that the vanguard must lead the masses forward is insufficient; when personal interests and the interests of the Party are consistent, they can obey the interests of the Party, but once the two conflict, it is difficult to unconditionally obey the interests of the Party. This is the distance or boundary between activists and Party members. Therefore, raising the level of activists to the level of Communist Party members is a very important part of Party building.
    In order to improve the level of activists, we spent a certain amount of effort and time (40 to 50 hours) to specifically educate them on the eight conditions of the standard of a Communist Party member. The method of education is to grasp the main ideological problems of the activists and solve them one by one in connection with actual life. According to our understanding, many activists have the most doubts about the nature of the Party and the need to fight for the realization of the communist system for life, and should talk and discuss more. In terms of education methods, we adopted a combination of large-scale lectures and small-scale seminars, and individual education, striving to achieve the goals of wide influence, deep understanding, and great effectiveness. In the large-scale lectures, all activists participated, and the masses were welcome to participate voluntarily. Small-scale seminars and individual education were mainly to solve the ideological problems of the development objects. III. Seriously conducting the review of activists and strictly fulfilling the procedures for joining the Party are important links in adhering to the conditions of Party members and ensuring the purity of the Party. The review of the class consciousness and historical situation of the development objects must be carried out with extremely meticulous methods. The Party's organizational departments should carefully study the process of their ideological changes, find their ideological contradictions from them, study whether their process of resolving these contradictions is in line with the actual laws, and then they can determine how high their level of consciousness is. As for the historical situation, in addition to mobilizing them to consciously confess, they should also conduct investigations through the masses. Then, the branch will conduct a rigorous review based on the materials from these two aspects, and must clarify their historical situation. According to our experience: In order to do a good job in education and review, the branch must regard every procedure for receiving new Party members as a specific and serious education work and review work. For example, the branch committee's review of the application for Party membership is an examination of whether the applicant has the determination to fight for communism. The branch general meeting's discussion and approval of the applicant as a Party member is a review and appraisal of them by the leadership and the masses together, and it is also a vivid and concrete education on the eight conditions of the standard of a Party member. Holding an admission ceremony is not only a serious and comprehensive education on the eight conditions for new Party members, but also an encouragement and encouragement to all mass activists. Therefore, the spirit of review and education should be conscientiously implemented in fulfilling every procedure for joining the Party. Only in this way can the quality of the Party be improved and the purity of the Party be guaranteed. Therefore, neglecting the review work, or thinking that "this procedure is important, that procedure is not important" is wrong and must be strictly criticized and corrected in time.
    In the process of Party building, in addition to adopting key experiments, drawing new Party building experiences and promptly reporting them to strengthen the leadership of this work, the Party's leading organs must also correctly implement the idea of ​​Party building by the whole Party and the close combination of Party building and production. Party building is a work of great political significance to welcome the arrival of large-scale national economic construction. In this regard, the Party's leading organs should make full preparations ideologically and organizationally, correctly grasp the Party Central Committee's spirit of Party building, do a good job in the registration and management of activists, appoint Party members to be responsible for cultivating new objects, and establish and train organizers. These are powerful guarantees for completing the Party building tasks. When we started Party building, some leading comrades did not have the idea of ​​Party building by the whole Party. They pushed the Party building task to the organizational department, so that other departments of the Party and some Party members did not regard Party building as their own task until a mobilization meeting was specially convened to correct this. In addition, at the beginning of Party building in many factories, the enthusiasm of workers and activists to join the Party was very high, and the enthusiasm for active production was also very high. Some workers automatically proposed the slogan "Do a good job in production competition and strive to join the Party." Therefore, some factories saw outstanding examples of increasing production efficiency by 62% and four people replacing all the work of eight people in the past, which proved that Party building has directly promoted the development of production. However, some Party leading cadres did not see this positive factor, and were busy leading production without paying attention to leading Party building, separating Party building from production. This is wrong, and we have used vivid examples to correct this problem in time.
    Finally, we also experienced that in leading work, we must pay attention to fighting against various wrong ideas. Generally speaking, in the early stage of Party building, we should mainly pay attention to criticizing and correcting the bias of some cadres who underestimate the consciousness of workers and activists and mystify the eight conditions of the standard of a Communist Party member. In the later stage of Party building, we should mainly prevent the following problems, that is, being satisfied with the simple class consciousness of activists without further improving their level to reach the level of a Communist Party member; treating Party building as a movement, creating a "Party building climax," and even proposing a "crash course" method when conducting education on the eight conditions of the standard of a Communist Party member. Therefore, only by resolutely fighting against these wrong practices can we overcome the phenomenon of sectarianism and recruitment of unqualified people and ensure the healthy development of Party building.

    太原市各厂、矿的建党经验
    徐镇海
    一
    山西省太原市各厂、矿党组织在领导各工厂完成民主改革和结束“三反”运动后，于“七一”前后接收了大批先进职工入党。其中有劳动模范，也有学习、工作模范。接收这批产业工人中的优秀分子入党的结果，不仅直接推动了当前的增产节约竞赛运动的开展，而且为各厂矿新的生产任务准备了条件。二各厂矿的建党工作一着手布置，工人们就纷纷“读党章，学八条”，争着报名上党课。这说明我们进行建党的条件是很好的。
    但是，积极分子的思想水平和共产党员的水平，还存在着距离。根据对积极分子中可以作为发展对象的思想情况的分析来看，除一部分积极分子对党员条件有比较清楚的瞭解以外，一般的只表示要决心当一个党员，但对党的基本知识还相当缺乏，甚至对党有错误的认识。例如：他们承认共产党是工人阶级的政党，但对党的阶级性认识不清，怀疑党的组织“为什么没有农民的一份”；懂得“新民主主义社会好，社会主义社会更好”，但对公有制的优越性认识不足；拥护党，跟着党走的观念很明确，但对终身为党的事业而斗争的观念则相当模糊；在工作中积极负责，能够发挥个人的作用，但对于先锋队必须带领群众前进的道理认识不足；在个人利益和党的利益一致时，能够服从党的利益，一旦两者发生矛盾，就很难无条件地服从党的利益了。这就是积极分子和党员的距离或界限。因此，把积极分子的水平提高到共产党员的水平，是建党工作中十分重要的一环。
    为了提高积极分子的水平，我们拿出了一定的力量和时间（四十至五十小时），专门对他们进行了共产党员标准的八项条件的教育。进行教育的方法是：抓住积极分子的主要思想问题，联系实际生活，逐一予以解决。据我们了解，许多积极分子对于党的性质和必须为实现共产主义制度而终身奋斗等等方面的疑问最多，应该多讲多讨论。在教育方式上，我们采取了上大课和举行小型座谈会、进行个别教育相结合的方式，力求达到影响宽、体会深、收效大的目的。在上大课时，都是吸收全体积极分子参加，并欢迎群众自愿参加，小型座谈和个别教育则主要是为了解决发展对象的思想问题。三认真进行对积极分子的审查，严格履行入党手续，是坚持党员条件、保证党的纯洁的重要环节。审查发展对象的阶级觉悟和历史情况，必须用极端细致的方法进行。党的组织部门应认真研究他们的思想变化过程，从中找到他们的思想矛盾，研究他们解决这些矛盾的过程是否合乎实际规律，然后才能判定他们的觉悟程度究竟有多么高。至于历史情况，除动员他们自觉交代外，还应通过群众进行调查。然后，支部再根据这两方面的材料进行严密审查，务必把他们的历史情况弄清楚。根据我们的体验：为了认真做好教育和审查工作，支部必须把接收新党员的每一项手续都看做是具体而严肃的教育工作和审查工作。如支委会审查申请入党者的入党志愿书，就是对于申请入党者是否具有为共产主义斗争的决心的一次考察。支部大会对申请入党者的讨论以及通过他们作为党员，则是领导方面和群众共同对他们的审查和鉴定，也是一次活的具体的党员标准的八项条件的教育。举行入党仪式，不仅对新党员是一次严肃的综合性的八项条件的教育，而且对所有群众积极分子也是一个鼓舞和勉励。所以履行每一项入党手续，均应认真贯彻审查、教育的精神。只有这样，才能提高党的质量，保证党的纯洁。因此，忽视审查工作，或者认为“这道手续重要，那道手续不重要”的说法，都是错误的，必须严格批判，及时纠正。
    在建党工作过程中，党的领导机关除应采用重点实验、吸取新的建党经验并及时通报，以加强对这一工作的领导外，还必须正确贯彻全党建党以及建党和生产紧密结合的思想。建党工作是迎接国家大规模经济建设到来的具有伟大政治意义的工作。对此，党的领导机关应该从思想上和组织上作充分准备，正确地掌握党中央的建党精神，做好对积极分子的登记管理工作，指定党员专责培养新的对象，建立和训练组织员，这些都是完成建党任务的有力保证。当我们开始建党时，有的领导同志没有全党建党的思想，他们把建党任务推给组织部门去干，以致党的其他部门和某些党员不把建党工作看成自己的任务，直到专门召开了一次动员大会才得到纠正。另外，许多工厂在建党开始时，工人积极分子要求入党的情绪非常高涨，而积极生产的情绪也很高涨。有的工人自动提出“搞好生产竞赛，争取入党”的口号。因而有的工厂出现了提高生产效率百分之六十二，出现了四个人代替过去八个人的全部工作等突出的事例，这都证明建党工作已经直接推动了生产的开展。但某些党的领导干部却看不见这种积极因素，忙于领导生产而不注意领导建党，把建党和生产分离开来。这是不对的，我们已用活的例子及时地纠正了这种毛病。
    最后，我们还体验到，在领导工作中必须注意和各种错误思想进行斗争。一般地讲，在建党初期，主要应注意批判和纠正某些干部对工人积极分子的觉悟估计不足，把共产党员标准的八项条件神秘化的偏向。建党后期主要应防止下述的毛病，即满足于积极分子的朴素的阶级觉悟，而不进一步提高他们的水平，使之达到共产党员的水平；把建党工作当成运动，制造“建党高潮”，甚至在进行共产党员标准的八项条件的教育时，也提出“速成式”的方法。因此，只有同这些错误作法作坚决的斗争，才能克服关门主义和拉夫现象，保证建党工作的健康发展。
