Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 24th: The Dalai Lama wrote an article on the 22nd entitled "The Tibetan People Firmly Support the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," as follows:

　　On March 21st of this year, eleven outstanding sons and daughters of our great Chinese nation, prominent figures dedicated to the cause of peace, including Soong Ching Ling and Guo Moruo, jointly sent a telegram inviting peace-loving and just individuals from countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts to jointly initiate the convening of the "Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference." After the preparatory meeting held in June, this conference will soon be held in our capital, Beijing. This conference fully aligns with the interests of all ethnic groups in our country and fully represents the will of peace-loving people from countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts. I, on behalf of the Tibetan people, firmly support the solemn opening of this conference and warmly congratulate it on achieving complete success.

　　For more than a hundred years, due to external imperialist aggression and instigation, and internal national oppression by successive reactionary governments, the Tibetan people and the Tibetan nationality have long been trapped in a painful state of being enslaved and oppressed. This is something that the Tibetan people can never forget. The lessons of the past have made the Tibetan people deeply realize that only by opposing imperialist aggression, opposing racial discrimination and national oppression, and only by uniting and striving for peace, can we guarantee freedom and happiness.

　　Since World War II, the aggressive camp headed by U.S. imperialism has replaced the former positions of fascist Germany and Japan, constantly engaging in provocative war activities, plotting to expand aggressive wars, bringing the threat of terrible death and disaster to the people of the world once again, and attempting to enslave all ethnic groups in the world once again.

　　However, the Chinese people and the people of the world, including the American people, are peace-loving and demand peace. The world's peace forces, led by the Soviet Union, are growing stronger. In particular, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between China and the Soviet Union, the strong unity of nearly 700 million people in the two countries, the existence of the powerful Soviet army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as the heroic battles of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean battlefield, are powerful guarantees for peace in Asia and the world. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, held in the motherland's capital of Beijing, even more powerfully demonstrates the strong force of the people of Asia and the world demanding peace and defending peace.

　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the Tibetan people have obtained full rights of national equality for more than a year since their peaceful liberation. The Tibetan nationality and people have returned to the big family of the motherland. In the affectionate and cooperative big family of the motherland, we, the Tibetan people, unite with the people of all fraternal nationalities to build the motherland, build our own homeland, and live a peaceful and happy life. Tibet is located on the border of the motherland and is an important strategic location for the national defense of our motherland. In order to defend the security of the motherland, defend the national equality and freedom rights that our Tibetan people have already obtained, defend lasting peace in the Asian and Pacific regions and the world, and oppose the imperialists' conspiracies of national oppression and expanding wars in Asia and the world, we, the Tibetan people, are determined to unite under the banner of Chairman Mao and vow to work together with the people of the whole country to unite the people of Asia, the Pacific, and the world who love peace. We firmly demand that the five major powers, China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, conclude a peace pact, abolish the unilateral peace treaty with Japan that violates the Potsdam Proclamation, oppose the remilitarization of Japan, immediately stop the Korean War, and prohibit the use of atomic and bacteriological weapons. We are willing to strive for the realization of the above-mentioned peace demands. We, the Tibetan people, will support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with practical actions of earnestly implementing the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet!"

　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, September 21st: Panchen Erdeni published an article on September 18th entitled "Celebrating the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference," the full text of which is as follows:

　　The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will soon be held in our country's capital. I, on behalf of all the political and religious officials, monks, and lay people of the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Rear Tibet, extend warm congratulations and wish the conference a complete success!

　　The preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has now achieved exciting results in countries along the Asian and Pacific coasts. This is a good foundation for holding this conference successfully. To this end, I, on behalf of the monks and lay people of the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Rear Tibet, extend our highest respect to those in Asian and Pacific regions countries who are dedicated to the cause of peace!

　　Our Tibetan people clearly see that the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialists is shamelessly plotting to drag the various nationalities of our motherland and the people of the world from a peaceful life into the abyss of war and suffering. While launching the war of aggression against Korea, it occupies our country's territory of Taiwan, and in our country's Northeast, it continues to wantonly bomb and strafe the peaceful residents of our cities and villages, and uses inhuman bacteriological weapons against the Chinese and Korean people, which are opposed by all mankind. In particular, disregarding our country and other countries that fought against Japan's resolute opposition, it illegally and unilaterally signed the so-called "Peace Treaty with Japan," plotting to remilitarize Japan.

　　We understand very clearly that all the conspiracies and tricks of the warmongers are delusions to realize their ambition to dominate the world and to enslave the peace-loving people of the world and the various fraternal nationalities of our motherland. In order to defend world peace, defend our motherland, defend our free and happy life after peaceful liberation from being destroyed again, and to defend our culture and religion from being destroyed by the invaders' artillery fire, we, the Tibetan people, are determined to unite with the various fraternal nationalities of the motherland, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the great leader Chairman Mao, to wage a resolute and unyielding struggle against the U.S. imperialist aggressive bloc; and to work together for the thorough realization of all resolutions of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼分别撰文
    坚决拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社拉萨二十四日电】达赖喇嘛在二十二日以“西藏人民坚决拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”为题，撰文如下：
    今年三月二十一日，我们伟大中华民族的优秀儿女、努力于和平事业的著名人士宋庆龄、郭沫若等十一人，曾联名发电邀请亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平与公正的人士，共同发起召开“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”，经过于六月间召开筹备会议以后，这一会议即将在我国首都北京举行了。这个会议完全符合于我国各族人民的利益，也完全代表着亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国爱好和平人民的意志。我谨代表西藏人民坚决拥护这一会议的庄严开幕，并热烈祝贺这次会议获得完满胜利。
    一百多年来，由于外受帝国主义的侵略和挑拨离间，内受历代反动政府的民族压迫，西藏民族和西藏人民曾长期陷于被奴役被压迫的痛苦境地。这是西藏人民所永远不能忘掉的。过去的历史的教训使藏族人民深刻地认识到：只有反对帝国主义的侵略，反对种族歧视和民族压迫；只有团结一致、争取和平，才是自由幸福的保障。
    第二次世界大战以来，以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营代替了过去法西斯德国和日本的地位，不断地进行挑拨战争的活动，阴谋扩大侵略战争，给全世界人民再一次带来可怕的死亡和灾难的威胁，再一次企图奴役全世界各族人民。
    但是，中国人民和世界人民包括美国人民在内，都是爱好和平、要求和平的。全世界以苏联为首的和平力量正在日益壮大，特别是中苏两大国家签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约，两国将近七亿人口的坚强团结，强大的苏联军队和中国人民解放军的存在，以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜战场上的英勇战斗，更是亚洲及世界和平的有力保障。这次在祖国首都北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，更有力地显示了亚洲及全世界人民要求和平和保卫和平的强大力量。
    西藏人民在毛主席及中央人民政府的领导下获得和平解放的一年多来，已得到充分的民族平等的权利。西藏民族和人民已经回到祖国的大家庭，在友爱合作的祖国大家庭中，我们藏族人民与各兄弟民族人民团结一致，正在建设祖国，建设自己的家园，过着和平快乐的生活。西藏地处祖国的边疆，是我祖国的国防要地，为了保卫祖国的安全，保卫我们藏族人民已获得的民族平等与自由权利，保卫亚洲、太平洋区域和世界的持久和平，反对帝国主义在亚洲和全世界进行其民族压迫、扩大战争的阴谋，我们西藏人民坚决团结在毛主席的旗帜下，誓与全国人民一起，团结亚洲、太平洋及全世界爱好和平的人民共同奋斗。我们坚决要求：中、苏、美英、法五大国缔结和平公约，废止违反波茨坦公告的片面对日和约，反对日本重新军国主义化，立即停止朝鲜战争，禁止使用原子武器和细菌武器。我们愿为实现上述和平要求而努力奋斗。我们西藏人民将以认真执行“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的实际行动来拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开！
    【新华社拉萨二十一日电】班禅额尔德尼在九月十八日发表题为“庆祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议”的文章，全文如下：
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在我国首都召开，我谨代表后藏札什伦布寺全体政教官员、僧俗民众致热烈祝贺，并预祝会议的圆满成功！
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的准备工作，现已在亚洲和太平洋沿岸各国获致令人兴奋的成就，这是开好这一会议的良好基础。为此，我代表后藏札什伦布寺的僧俗人民向亚洲及太平洋区域各国致力于和平事业的人士致以崇高的敬意！
    我藏族人民清楚地看到以美帝国主义者为首的侵略集团正在无耻地阴谋把我祖国各民族和世界人民从和平的生活拖入战争苦难的深渊。它在发动侵略朝鲜的战争的同时，霸占我国的领土台湾，在我国东北又不断地滥肆轰炸和扫射我城乡和平居民，并对中朝人民使用为全人类所反对的绝灭人性的细菌武器。尤其是不顾我国和其他对日作战国家的坚决反对，非法片面地签订了所谓“对日和约”，阴谋使日本重新军国主义化。
    我们很明白地看到战争贩子们所有的一切阴谋诡计是妄想实现其独霸全世界的野心，是要奴役全世界爱好和平的人民和我们祖国的各兄弟民族。我们藏族人民为了保卫世界和平、保卫祖国，为了保卫我们和平解放后的自由幸福生活不再遭受破坏，为了保卫我们的文化、宗教不受侵略者的炮火毁灭，决心和祖国各兄弟民族团结在一起，在中央人民政府和伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，英勇不屈地向美帝国主义侵略集团进行坚决的斗争；并为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议一切决议的彻底实现而共同奋斗。
