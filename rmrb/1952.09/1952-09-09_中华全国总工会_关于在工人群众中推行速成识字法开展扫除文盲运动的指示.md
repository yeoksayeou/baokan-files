    I. In the past four months, the experimental promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method" among workers has achieved great success in various industrial and mining enterprises across the country. The vast majority of illiterate workers are eagerly demanding to improve their education through the "Rapid Literacy Method." According to incomplete statistics from Northeast China, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, Shandong, Shanxi, Chahar, Shijiazhuang, and other places, 4,368 experimental classes for workers have been organized, with 258,003 workers participating in the learning. Furthermore, according to incomplete statistics from Northeast China, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanxi, Chahar, and other places, 15,439 people have already graduated after 150 to 200 hours of classroom learning, having learned 1,500 to 2,000 characters, and being able to read popular publications and write simple articles. Facts have proven that in industrial and mining enterprises, as long as each person is guaranteed 8 to 10 hours of classes per week, with sufficient time for review, it is entirely possible to widely promote the "Rapid Literacy Method" to eliminate illiteracy among workers. In addition, major administrative regions have trained a large number of teachers and made comprehensive plans for eliminating illiteracy. If these plans are realized, more than 1.5 million illiterate workers will be eliminated this year alone.
    II. In the process of promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method" among workers, various regions have also gained some relatively mature experience: First, it is necessary to proceed from reality, promoting from point to area, and through the experimental experience of the points, mobilize the masses, train teachers, and expand publicity. Those who have done so have achieved success; conversely, blind promotion has led to failure. Second, the constant leadership of the Party and the strong support of responsible administrative comrades are the keys to carrying out this movement. Because of the leadership's attention, not only can the problems of time, teachers, and equipment be solved in a timely manner, but also the learning enthusiasm of the students is greatly encouraged. Experience has proven that cultural and educational cadres must be "diligent in speech, diligent in movement, proactive, and flexible," and seize every opportunity to publicize, never being afraid of trouble. Third, under the unified leadership of the Party, the Party, government, trade union, and youth league must be organized, scientifically dividing labor and carrying out work, in order to ensure that the movement progresses in a planned, step-by-step, organized, and orderly manner. Fourth, to launch a large-scale illiteracy elimination movement, it is necessary to widely mobilize social potential to serve as full-time teachers, part-time teachers, counselors, and "little teachers," in order to solve the difficulty of a shortage of teachers; otherwise, entrusting the task solely to a small number of full-time teachers will not solve the problem.
    III. Based on the achievements and experiences already gained in various regions, it can be affirmed that the high tide of a large-scale illiteracy elimination movement among workers using the "Rapid Literacy Method" is inevitable. However, in the experiment, some problems have also occurred in many places. The first of these problems is eagerness for quick results and rash action. For example, some places did not pay attention to experimental work and adopted the policy of "spreading out in all directions and focusing on key points," giving teachers only three to five days of rough training before widely launching illiteracy elimination work, resulting in many teachers being unable to cope, causing some unnecessary losses to the work. In some places, plans were not based on reality, blindly pursuing numbers and setting deadlines for eliminating illiteracy, resulting in inadequate preparation, insufficient strength, neglecting one thing for another, and falling into a passive position. Second, there is conservatism. Many of our existing full-time teachers are old intellectuals who have not been reformed. Promoting the "Rapid Literacy Method" through these people is essentially old people doing new things, so some ideological obstacles have been created in the work, such as a purely technical viewpoint, rejecting mass work, and worrying about unemployment, which have also affected the promotion of the Rapid Literacy Method. Third, there is the issue of consolidation and improvement. Currently, hundreds of thousands of workers across the country are learning literacy using the "Rapid Literacy Method," and tens of thousands have already graduated, but no place has gained experience in consolidating and improving the skills of graduates. On the contrary, the newly literate are not being taken care of, and this issue has not been included in the plans of various regions, resulting in the phenomenon of relapse into illiteracy. This is a very serious problem that must be solved; otherwise, all the work will be in vain.
    IV. Based on the above problems and according to existing experience, trade unions at all levels must resolutely implement the policy of proceeding from point to area, consolidating development, and advancing steadily, re-examining their plans, and overcoming the phenomenon of eagerness for quick results, in order to welcome the arrival of a large-scale illiteracy elimination movement. To this end, the following preparations must be further improved:
    First, in order to make our existing experience more comprehensive and systematic, major administrative regions, provincial and municipal trade unions, and industrial trade unions should, in conjunction with the government's cultural and educational departments at the same level and all relevant parties, under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, obtain the experience of comprehensively eliminating illiteracy in at least one workshop, one factory, one mine, and one enterprise by the end of this year, and the elimination of illiteracy in a workshop, factory, mine, or enterprise must also adopt the policy of promoting from point to area. At the same time, attention should be paid to summarizing the experience of solving problems such as time, teacher training, organization and leadership, and consolidation and improvement, and promptly promoting them to guide the overall situation.
    Second, leaders at all levels must regard the work of reforming teachers as a regular task; otherwise, the work cannot advance rapidly. In addition to strengthening political education and pointing out their future when training teachers, the following steps must be taken to reform them:
    (1) Illiteracy elimination leading bodies at all levels must have someone specifically responsible for teacher work, strengthening ideological leadership over them in daily work and helping them do a good job in mass work.
    (2) Discover and cultivate model teachers, and use model teachers to promptly disseminate advanced teaching experience to improve old teachers.
    (3) Formulate regulations for rewarding model teachers, and in addition to giving spiritual rewards, a certain amount of funds should be allocated to give outstanding teachers certificates, medals, or bonuses.
    Third, it is necessary to do a good job in preparation, and in the preparation work, the teachers, teaching materials, reading materials, and funding required for the consolidation and improvement should be included in the plan; otherwise, it is tantamount to no preparation, and it is also tantamount to being rash. Therefore, it is necessary to re-define the standards for eliminating illiteracy:
    (1) Recognize more than 2,000 characters and be able to use them;
    (2) All those who have been eliminated from illiteracy using the "Rapid Literacy Method" must also have a full-time teacher leading them to read a certain number of popular publications, write a certain number of short articles, and regularly read newspapers within a certain period of time, and after passing examinations and tests, proving that they do indeed recognize more than 2,000 characters and can use them freely before a graduation certificate can be issued.
    Fourth, trade unions at all levels must strengthen the research and inspection work on the promotion of the "Rapid Literacy Method," and promote the advanced experience of promoting the Rapid Literacy Method in an organized, planned, and led manner, and correctly publicize the Rapid Literacy Method. It is necessary to oppose both conservative thinking and prevent phenomena of "rapid but not successful" and creating something new just to be different.
    Fifth, various regions should regularly summarize experience and report it level by level.

### 中华全国总工会  关于在工人群众中推行速成识字法开展扫除文盲运动的指示

    中华全国总工会
    关于在工人群众中推行速成识字法开展扫除文盲运动的指示
    一、四个月来，在工人中实验推行“速成识字法”，已在全国各工矿企业内取得了很大成绩。广大工人文盲都迫不及待地要求以“速成识字法”提高文化。据东北、上海、北京、天津、重庆、山东、山西、察哈尔、石家庄等地不完全统计，目前已组织了工人实验班四三六八班，参加学习的工人为二五八、○○三人。又据东北、北京、天津、山西、察哈尔等地不完全统计，已经有一五、四三九人，经过一百五十到二百小时的课堂学习，学会了一千五百到二千个单字，并能阅读通俗读物会写简单文章而毕业了。事实证明，在工矿企业中，只要保证每人每周上课八小时到十小时，并有充足的复习时间，在工人中广泛推行“速成识字法”扫除工人中的文盲，是完全可能的。此外各大行政区并训练了大批教员和做了全面扫除文盲的计划。如果实现了这些计划，只今年就要扫除工人文盲一百五十多万。
    二、在工人中推行“速成识字法”的实验过程中，各地并取得了一些比较成熟的经验：第一，必须从实际出发，由点到面地推广，并通过点的实验经验，发动群众，训练教员，扩大宣传。凡是这样做的，都得到了成功，反之，盲目推行，就遭到失败。第二，党的经常领导与行政负责同志的大力支持，是开展这个运动的关键。因为领导上的重视，不但时间、教员、设备等问题都能及时解决，而且对学员的学习情绪也有很大的鼓舞。经验证明，文教干部必须“口勤、腿勤、主动、机动”，一有机会就进行宣传，绝不能怕麻烦。第三，在党的统一领导下，党、政、工、团必须组织起来，科学分工，进行工作，才能保证运动有计划、有步骤、有组织、有秩序地前进。第四，要开展一个大规模的扫除文盲运动，必须广泛动员社会潜力出任专任教员、兼任教员、辅导员和小先生，方能解决师资缺乏的困难，否则，把任务仅仅寄托在少数的专任教员身上，是不能解决问题的。
    三、根据各地已有成绩和经验，可以肯定，以“速成识字法”在工人中展开大规模的扫除文盲运动的高潮，不可避免地就要到来了。但是在实验当中，不少地方也发生了一些问题。这些问题首先是急于求成，草率从事。例如有的地方不重视实验工作，采取了“全面铺开，重点掌握”的方针，对教员只进行三、五天的粗糙训练，便广泛地展开了扫除文盲工作，致许多教员不能胜任，使工作遭受了一些不应遭受的损失。也有些地方，订计划不从实际出发，盲目追求数字，限期扫除文盲，结果准备不周，力量不足，顾此失彼，陷于被动。第二，是保守现象。我们现有的专任教员，很多是未经改造的旧知识分子，通过这些人推行“速成识字法”，实即是旧人办新事，因此在工作中造成了一些思想障碍，如单纯技术观点，拒绝群众工作，担心失业等，也影响了速成识字法的推广。第三，是巩固与提高的问题。现在全国各地，已有数十万工人以“速成识字法”学习识字，并已有几万人毕了业，但还没有一个地方取得了对于已经毕业的学员进行巩固与提高的经验。相反的，已被扫除的文盲竟无人照管，各地计划也没有列入这一问题，致使文盲再犯的现象已经发生。这是一个十分严重的问题，必须解决，否则全部工作将等于白费。
    四、基于以上问题，根据现有经验，各级工会必须坚决贯彻由点到面，巩固发展，稳步前进的方针，重新审查自己的计划，克服急于求成现象，以迎接大规模扫除文盲运动的到来。为此必须进一步做好以下几项准备工作：
    第一、为了使我们已经取得的经验更加全面，更有系统、要求各大行政区、各省、市工会及各产业工会，会同同级政府文教部门和各有关方面，在各级党委统一领导下，在今年年底，各该工会均应至少取得一个车间、一个厂、一个矿、一个企业全面扫除文盲的经验，而在一个车间、厂、矿、企业中扫除文盲，也必须采取由点到面推广的方针。同时在工作中要注意总结解决时间问题、训练教员、组织领导、巩固与提高等工作的经验，及时推广，指导全面。
    第二，各级领导必须把改造教员的工作当成一个经常任务，否则就不能使工作迅速前进。改造的方法，除在训练教员时加强政治教育，指明其前途外，必须采取如下的步骤：
    （一）各级扫除文盲领导机构，要有专人负责教员工作，在日常工作中加强对他们的思想领导，帮助他们做好群众工作。
    （二）发现与培养模范教师，通过模范教师及时传播先进的教学经验，用以改进旧教员。
    （三）制订模范教师奖励条例，除给以精神奖励外，并应拨出一定经费，优者给以奖状、奖章或奖金。
    第三，一定要做好准备工作，而在准备工作中必须把巩固与提高问题所需要的教员、教材、读物与经费计划进去，否则等于没有准备，也等于冒进。因此必须从新规定扫除文盲标准：
    （一）认识二千字以上，并且能用；
    （二）凡以“速成识字法”扫除了的文盲，还必须有专任教员领导，在一定时间，再读完若干本通俗读物，写若干篇短文，并经常看报，经过考试测验，证明确实认识二千字以上，并能运用自如，方能发给毕业证书。
    第四，各级工会必须加强推行“速成识字法”的研究与检查工作，有组织、有计划、有领导地推广推行速成识字法的先进经验，正确宣传速成识字法，既要反对保守思想，又要防止速而不成和标新立异的现象。
    第五，各地应经常总结经验，逐级上报。
