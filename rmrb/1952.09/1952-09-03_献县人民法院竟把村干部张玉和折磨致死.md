    Xian County People's Court Actually Tortured Village Cadre Zhang Yuhe to Death
    Editor: I am a revolutionary soldier, currently working in a unit of the North China Military Region. I am lodging a complaint against the bureaucratic practices of the Hebei Province Xian County People's Court and the crimes of certain bad elements who caused the death of my father, Zhang Yuhe. Zhang Yuhe was from Xu Nengtun Village, Xian County, Hebei Province, a middle peasant, and illiterate. During the later stages of the Anti-Japanese War, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and served as a public security officer and production committee member in the village. He was also elected as a people's representative. He was a backbone element in the land reform work. During his tenure as a public security officer, he arrested several bad elements. Between February and June 1950, farmers from Xu Nengtun and other villages had disputes over digging a river, and he represented the people of Xu Nengtun and more than ten other villages in sending three letters of opinion to the Cang County Commissioner's Office and the Hebei Provincial People's Government. In July 1950, while he was returning from the Provincial People's Government to the Commissioner's Office, villagers from both sides of the river-digging dispute fought over the measurement of the river section, and a water conservancy cadre was also beaten. He returned home several days after the fight occurred. However, the Xian County People's Court, using the excuse of "lack of organization, lack of discipline, anarchism, failure to execute government orders, and leading the masses to resist the government," detained Zhang Yuhe and subjected him to shackles and other physical punishments.

    After I learned about this matter, I asked the political department of my unit to urge the Xian County People's Court to expedite the handling of the case three times. However, the court ignored it. Later, the political department of my unit sent someone with an official letter to the Xian County People's Court to understand the situation, but the court still ignored it. In November 1950, I personally went to the Xian County People's Court with an official letter, but the court still ignored it. In March 1951, I volunteered to participate in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. When I returned from the front line this January, I learned that my father had died last August.

    How did my father die? He had argued with several key county cadres about the river-digging issue. Therefore, after he was detained, he was put in shackles and handcuffs and treated as a "principal criminal." On the other hand, some bad elements used this opportunity to take revenge under the guise of official duty. For example, a bad element nicknamed "Ma Qinglin" was sent to the county people's court for sentencing during my father's tenure as a village public security officer, and his sentence has not yet been completed. This "Ma Qinglin" used means such as offering meals and drinks to win over prison staff, inciting prison staff to make things difficult for my father, not giving him food, not giving him water, and finally torturing him into illness. The court did not give my father treatment, nor did they allow him to be released for treatment. At this time, my father was already paralyzed, blind, and unable to move, but the court still ignored it. Only when there was no way to save him did they ask my family to carry my father out, and he died on the way.

    What crime did my father commit? In October 1951, two months after my father was killed, and also one year and two months after he was arrested, the court made a judgment, announcing: "Zhang Yuhe and four others are released." How absurd and intolerable this is! The court is the people's court, but I don't understand why they would so brutally harm the life of a Communist Party member, a village cadre, and a revolutionary soldier's family member, and be so irresponsible?

    This January, I asked the political department of a unit of the North China Military Region to write an official letter and send it along with the court's "judgment" to the Hebei Provincial People's Court, requesting them to investigate and handle the matter. Now, eight months have passed, and there is still no result.

    I request the higher-level judicial authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of the case as soon as possible and make a serious decision.

### 献县人民法院竟把村干部张玉和折磨致死

    献县人民法院竟把村干部张玉和折磨致死
    编辑同志：我是革命军人，现在华北军区某部工作。我控诉河北省献县人民法院的官僚主义及某些坏分子害死我父亲张玉和的罪行。张玉和是河北省献县许能屯村人，中农，文盲。抗日战争后期，他参加了中国共产党，在村内任过公安员、生产委员等，还当选过人民代表。在土地改革工作中，他是村里的骨干。在任公安员期间，曾经逮捕过坏分子数人。一九五○年二月至六月间，许能屯等村农民因挖河问题闹纠纷，他代表许能屯等十多村人民向沧县专署和河北省人民政府送过三次意见书。一九五○年七月间，他正由省人民政府返回专署的途中，挖河纠纷的双方村民因丈量河段而斗殴起来，一位水利干部也被殴打。斗殴发生后数日，他才回到家中。但献县人民法院却用“无组织、无纪律、无政府主义、不执行政府命令、带动群众反抗政府”为名，把张玉和扣押起来，并施以镣铐等肉刑。
    我知道此事后，便请我部政治部门先后三次向献县人民法院催请尽快处理。但该法院一直置之不理。后来，我部政治部门派人拿着公函去献县人民法院了解情况，该法院仍然置之不理。一九五○年十一月间，我拿了公函亲去献县人民法院，该法院还是置之不理。一九五一年三月间，我志愿参加抗美援朝工作。今年一月间我从前线回来后，才知道父亲已在去年八月间死去。
    我父亲怎样死的呢？他曾为挖河问题和几个主要的县干部顶过嘴，所以他被押后，就被带上脚镣手铐，当作“刑事主犯”。另一方面，一些坏分子又从中假公报私，进行陷害。比如一个绰号叫“麻青林”的坏分子，在我父亲任村公安员时被送县人民法院判处徒刑，现在刑期还没有满。这“麻青林”用请吃请喝等手段，拉拢监狱工作人员，唆使管狱人员刁难我父亲，不给饭吃，不给水喝，最后把他折磨成病。而该法院也不给我父亲治疗，也不让保出治疗。这时，我父亲已经瘫软、眼瞎，根本不能行动了，该法院还是不理。直到无法救治的时候，才叫我家把我父亲抬出来，途中便死了。
    我父亲究竟有什么罪呢？一九五一年十月，即我父亲被害死后两个月，也是他被捕一年又两个月后，该法院判决了，宣布：“张玉和等五人释放。”这是何等荒唐、令人不能容忍的事！该法院是人民的法院，但我不懂为什么他们对一个共产党员、村干部、革命军人家属的生命竟如此横加残害、如此不负责任？
    今年一月间，我请华北军区某部政治部写了公函和该院“判决书”一并送给河北省人民法院，要求他们调查处理。现在八个月过去了，也还没有结果。
    我要求上级司法部门对该案迅速进行周密的调查，并作严肃处理。
