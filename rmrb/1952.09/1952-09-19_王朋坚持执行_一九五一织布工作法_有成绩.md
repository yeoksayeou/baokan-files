    Wang Peng Achieves Results by Insisting on Implementing the "1951 Weaving Method"
    Editor: Wang Peng, a loom operator at the Da Xing Textile Factory in Shijiazhuang, has achieved results in production by diligently implementing the 1951 Weaving Method.

    Wang Peng is a new worker. Since learning the "1951 Weaving Method," she has been able to watch four looms. During the production increase and conservation campaign this year, she did not produce a single piece of second-class cloth in April and May, and her cloth output ranked first in the entire workshop. The reason for her success is mainly because she fully understood the basic spirit of the 1951 Weaving Method, applied it flexibly to her own work, and transformed it into her own operating method. For example, when the warp yarn on a certain loom is tangled and prone to breakage, she spends most of her time dealing with warp yarn breakages. When the warp yarns on the looms are all in good condition and not prone to breakage, she does more cleaning work. Her experience has educated many employees, enabling them to overturn the conservative idea that "the quality of the yarn is low, and production tasks cannot be completed." Sun Wenkang

### 王朋坚持执行“一九五一织布工作法”有成绩

    王朋坚持执行“一九五一织布工作法”有成绩
    编辑同志：石家庄市大兴纺织厂织布间档车工王朋，认真执行一九五一织布工作法，生产上获得成绩。
    王朋是个新工人，自学会“一九五一织布工作法”后，便能看四台车了。今年增产节约运动中，她在四、五两个月内没出过一匹次布，布的产量占全车间第一。她获得成绩的原因，主要是因为她完全领会了一九五一织布工作法的基本精神，灵活运用到自己的实际工作中去，变为自己的操作方法。如当某台车上的经纱乱，容易断头时，她便把大部分时间放在处理经纱断头上。当车上的经纱都很好，不易断头时，她便多作清洁工作。她的经验教育了许多职工，使许多职工扭转了“纱的质量低，不能完成生产任务”的保守思想。    孙文康
