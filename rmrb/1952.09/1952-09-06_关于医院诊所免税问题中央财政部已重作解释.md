In response to criticisms and suggestions from readers of the People's Daily:

    Regarding the Tax Exemption for Hospitals and Clinics, the Central Ministry of Finance Has Reinterpreted It
    To the Editors: The "Regulations on Exemption of Industrial and Commercial Tax for Hospitals and Clinics," promulgated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council on November 27, 1950, stipulates in Article 2 that private hospitals and clinics must meet the following three conditions to be exempt from industrial and commercial tax: 1. Accepting certain wartime, epidemic prevention, and healthcare tasks, and bearing a portion of free beds and free outpatient services; 2. Charging fees strictly according to the standards stipulated by the health administrative authorities; 3. Not selling medicines to non-patients. However, most doctors who practice in rural areas do not have beds and also sell some over-the-counter drugs to facilitate farmers, so they are all ineligible for exemption from industrial and commercial tax. Yet, they are often required to participate in social health work carried out by the government, such as epidemic prevention injections, vaccinations, health education, disease eradication and prevention, and epidemic reporting.
    In order to enable them to actively participate in social health work and to facilitate the development of rural health work, we suggest that relevant departments provide an interpretation of the "Regulations on Exemption of Industrial and Commercial Tax for Hospitals and Clinics" so that these practicing doctors can also receive tax-exempt treatment.

    关于医院诊所免税问题中央财政部已重作解释
    编辑同志：政务院财政经济委员会在一九五○年十一月二十七日公布的“医院诊所免征工商业税的规定”，文中第二条规定，私营医院诊所必须具备下列三个条件，才可免征工商业税：一，接受一定之战勤、防疫、保健等任务，及负担一部免费病床、免费门诊者；二，确实按卫生行政机关规定之标准收费者；三，不对非就诊之病人售药者。但是，在乡村的挂牌开业的医生，绝大部分都没有病床，并且还附带售卖一部成药以便利农民，因此就一律不得免征工商业税。而目前政府进行的防疫注射、种痘、卫生宣传、疾病的扑灭和预防、疫情报告等社会卫生工作，却又经常要他们参加。
    为了能够使他们积极地参加社会卫生工作，以利于农村卫生工作的开展，我们建议有关部门对“医院诊所免征工商业税的规定”给以解释，使这些挂牌开业的医生也能得到免税的待遇。
