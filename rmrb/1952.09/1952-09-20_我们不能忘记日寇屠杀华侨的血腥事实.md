    We Must Not Forget the Bloody Facts of the Japanese Invaders' Massacre of Overseas Chinese
    Editor: I am an overseas Chinese student from a peace-loving New China. I warmly support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and warmly welcome the peace fighters who have arrived and will arrive in our capital for the meeting, because they bring the wishes and confidence of hundreds of millions of good people to strive for peace.
    War is only desired by imperialists and their lackeys; while the people are peace-loving and resolutely oppose war. The bloody facts of World War II are still fresh in my mind. When the Japanese devils occupied Southeast Asia, I was living in Thailand. In order to build the military "railway" from Thailand to Burma, the enemy not only forcibly conscripted local people, but also seized our compatriots living overseas. These people were thus separated from their wives and children, and a total of nearly 300,000 people died miserably due to the enemy's abuse and oppression. I once saw a family of seventeen or eighteen people forced to commit collective suicide. Today, American imperialism is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, so we must resolutely oppose it, and we urgently demand peace. I place deep hope in the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. I believe that the representatives actively elected by the people of the entire Asia and Pacific region will be able to complete this great task.

    我们不能忘记日寇屠杀华侨的血腥事实
    编辑同志：我是爱好和平的新中国的华侨学生。我热忱地拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，并热烈欢迎已经和将要到达我国首都开会的各位和平战士，因为他们带来了亿万善良的人们争取和平的愿望和信心。
    战争，只是帝国主义及其走狗们所向往的；而人民则是爱好和平坚决反对战争的。第二次世界大战血腥的事实，在我的脑子里记忆犹新。日本鬼子占领南洋时，我正侨居在泰国。敌人为了建筑泰国到缅甸的军用“铁路”，除了强征当地人民之外，还抓去了我国侨居海外的同胞，这些人都因此而妻离子散，总计因不堪敌人虐待和压迫而惨遭死亡的近三十万人。我曾亲眼见过一家大小十七、八口，因此而被迫全家集体自杀。今天，美帝国主义又在加紧复活日本的军国主义，因此，我们必须坚决反对，我们迫切要求和平。我对即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，寄以深切的希望。我相信，为全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民所积极选出来的代表们，一定能完成这一伟大的任务。
