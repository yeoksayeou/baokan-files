The entire membership of the Wang Jinyun Agricultural Production Cooperative
Reports to Chairman Mao on the start of the struggle against nature

    Respected Chairman Mao: Now we report to you a great joyous event in our agricultural production cooperative: Before the "August 1st" Army Day this year, we built a large dry well with a capacity of more than 45,000 dan of water, which can irrigate more than 300 mu of land.
    Our place is a mountainous area, not only without rivers, but even digging wells on flat ground often requires digging very deep before water can be found. Therefore, our farming could only depend on the heavens. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, we defeated the landlord class, got rid of feudal exploitation, and organized ourselves for collective production. We politically turned ourselves around, production improved, and our lives also improved; however, drought still threatened us. The Party cares about us everywhere, and leads us to begin the struggle against nature. Wang Jinyun, the director of our agricultural production cooperative and secretary of the Party branch, according to the instructions of the higher authorities and the demands of the masses, put forward a plan to build four dry wells within three years and turn 500 mu of dry land into paddy fields. At the beginning, many people were skeptical of this plan. They said, "Can our mountain gullies be turned into paddy fields?" "If it doesn't rain, no amount of effort will work!" Comrade Wang Jinyun then put forward slogans such as "Demanding water from the sky," "Turning dry land into paddy fields depends on people, not on the heavens; build more dry wells, human effort will surely overcome nature," and worked in many ways to get through to these people ideologically. Thus, on July 22nd, the work of building the dry well began.
    Building the dry well had difficulties. At that time, it was the busy season of the third weeding and topdressing of fertilizer. Building a dry well that could hold 45,000 dan of water was estimated to require at least 500 workdays. Delaying the weeding and topdressing of fertilizer would affect production increase, and delaying the well building would miss the rainy season, making it impossible to accumulate water. The benefit of your call for us to "organize ourselves" became apparent at this time. Our agricultural production cooperative was formed this year by merging three cooperatives, with more than 200 laborers from the three natural villages of Gedao, Qiangou, and Hougou. We extracted 30 to 40 laborers every day to be responsible for building the dry well, and the rest of the laborers launched a shock campaign to weed and topdress fertilizer. As a result, production and well building did not interfere with each other: not only was topdressing and weeding completed, but some even exceeded the plan; the dry well building work was also completed on July 30th with only 343 workdays because of everyone's efforts. We planned to conduct compacting and applying lime and red soil in early August to prevent the dry well from leaking water.
    Things really coincided, and it rained heavily just after the dry well was built. At this time, a moving event occurred: cooperative members Han Jinmu, Shi Yunsheng, Liu Erhai, Zhang Suhe, and non-cooperative member Gong Jintang braved the heavy rain to pour water into the well to modify the channels, not only filling the dry well half full but also preventing more than 100 mu of autumn fields from being flooded and buried by soil. After the rain, all of our cooperative members went to the edge of the well to see, and everyone happily said, "It rained after the well was built, the flood was also prevented, and it saved us from carrying water when plastering the well."
    On August 1st, we celebrated "August 1st" Army Day and held a celebration meeting for the dry well at the same time. At the meeting, we all unanimously agreed to name this well the "August 1st Dry Well" and set up a commemorative book, giving Han Jinmu and the other five people each a major commendation. That day, many peasant brothers from nearby villages came to our village to visit the dry well, and some even came from places thirty or forty li away. They all said, "Organizing is really strong! Only by organizing can we 'man conquer nature,' and mountain gullies can also be turned into paddy fields." Ren Fulin, the leader of the Panlong mutual aid group, said that after returning, he would definitely do a good job in the mutual aid group and create conditions to strive to develop the mutual aid group into an agricultural production cooperative as soon as possible.
    Chairman Mao: Our struggle with nature has just begun. But this makes us deeply believe: under your leadership, we are organized, and we can completely overcome nature and create good conditions for improving production. We are determined to redouble our efforts, overcome conservative ideas, create a better future, and make our poor mountain gullies prosperous, beautiful, and happy.

    王锦云农业生产合作社全体社员
    向毛主席报告开始和自然作斗争的情况
    敬爱的毛主席：现在向您报告一件我们农业生产合作社里的大喜事：我们在今年“八一”节前夕，打成了一个容量四万五千多担水、可浇三百多亩地的大旱池。
    我们这里是山沟地方，不但没有河流，就是在平地打井，也常常打得很深还出不了水。因此，我们种庄稼的就只能靠天吃饭。解放后，我们在共产党和人民政府的领导下，打垮了地主阶级、摆脱了封建剥削，并且组织起来，集体生产。我们在政治上翻了身，生产提高了，生活也改善了；但是，旱灾仍旧威胁着我们。党处处关心着我们，又领导我们开始和自然作斗争。我们农业生产合作社主任、党支部书记王锦云根据上级的指示和群众的要求，提出了在三年内打四个旱池、把五百亩旱地变为水田的计划。开始时，有不少人对这个计划是怀疑的，他们说：“咱们山沟地还能变水田？”“天不下雨，想什么办法也不行！”王锦云同志就提出了“向天要水”，“旱地变水田，靠人不靠天；多多打旱池，人力定胜天”等口号，并多方面来打通这些人的思想。于是，七月二十二日，打旱池的工作开始了。
    打旱池是有困难的。当时正是紧张繁忙的三锄和上追肥的季节，打一个能放四万五千担水的旱池预计至少要五百个工。误了锄苗和上追肥会影响增产，误了打池又会错过雨季，积不起水。您号召我们“组织起来”的好处在这时候就显出来了。我们这个农业生产合作社是今年由三个社合并组成的，全社有圪道、前沟、后沟三个自然村的二百多个劳动力。我们每天抽出三十到四十个劳动力负责打旱池，其余的劳动力就突击锄苗上追肥。结果，生产打池两不误：追肥、锄苗不但完成，有的还超过计划；打旱池工作也因为大家的努力，只用了三百四十三个工就在七月三十日完成了。我们计划在八月上旬再进行打实和涂抹石灰、红土的工作，以免旱池漏水。
    事情真是凑巧，旱池刚刚打好，天就下了一场大雨。这时出现了一件动人的事：社员韩金木、史云生、刘二孩、张苏河和非社员弓晋堂五人冒着大雨往池里泼水改修渠道，不但使旱池灌得半满，还防止了一百多亩秋田水冲土埋的涝灾。雨后，我们全体社员都到池边去看，大家高兴地说：“池打好了才下雨，涝也防了，抹池时也省得担水了。”
    八月一日，我们庆祝“八一”建军节，同时举行了庆贺旱池大会。会上，我们大家一致同意把这个池子命名为“八一旱池”，并立了一个纪念册，给韩金木等五人各记一大功。那天，附近很多农民弟兄都到我们村来参观旱池，有的还从三、四十里以外的地方赶来。他们都说：“组织起来真是强！只有组织起来，才能‘人定胜天’，把山沟地也可以变水田。蟠龙互助组组长任福林表示，回去后一定做好互助组的工作，创造条件，争取早日把互助组发展为农业生产合作社。
    毛主席：我们和自然作斗争还刚是开步走。但这使我们深信：在您的领导下，我们组织起来，完全可以战胜自然，创造提高生产的好条件。我们决心加倍努力，克服保守思想，创造更美好的将来，使我们的穷山沟变得繁荣、美丽而幸福。
