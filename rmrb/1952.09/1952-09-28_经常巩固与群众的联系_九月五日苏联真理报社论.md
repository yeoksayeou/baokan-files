    Constantly Consolidate Ties with the Masses
    -- September 5th Editorial of the Soviet Pravda

    In these days of our preparation for the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks), the inseparable link between the Communist Party and the broad masses of working people is particularly evident. In greeting the Congress, the Soviet people are more closely united around their beloved Party, the Party's Central Committee, and the great leader and teacher Comrade Stalin. In the new upsurge of socialist competition, the whole people's love for the Party and their boundless loyalty to the Party's great cause are vividly demonstrated.

    The great Lenin, in discussing the source of strength of the proletarian party, wrote that if the party is good at "linking with the broadest masses of working people – first with the proletarian working people, but also with the non-proletarian working people – approaching them, and in some ways even merging with them," then it will be invincible. Lenin taught that the Party must win the trust of the masses every day, must win the support of the masses with its policies and work, and must help the masses to be convinced of the correctness of the Party's policies based on their own experience.

    In the course of the great work of the socialist transformation of the country, the Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, has continuously consolidated and strengthened its ties with the masses, calling on and guiding them to participate in the struggle to realize the Party's slogans and resolutions. The Party's cause in our country has long become the cause of the whole people. The broad masses of non-Party people regard the Party as their own, their close and dear Party, they are closely concerned with the growth and consolidation of the Party, and they voluntarily entrust their destiny to the leadership of the Party.

    Based on years of experience, the Soviet people are convinced of the correctness of the Party's policies and are convinced that all the activities of the Lenin-Stalin Party are selflessly serving the people. The inseparable link between the Party and the masses is a reliable guarantee for new victories of communism. "Usually, it can be considered that – Comrade Stalin said – when the Bolsheviks maintain contact with the broad masses of the people, they will be invincible."

    The Party always requires every member: to establish close ties with the masses, to constantly consolidate this connection, to be good at listening to the opinions of the masses and understanding their urgent needs, and to be ready not only to educate the masses but also to learn from the masses at all times. Under the present conditions, when our country is realizing the gradual transition from socialism to communism, and when the realization of the great task of communist construction requires mobilizing all the creative forces of the people, the significance of this requirement is particularly enhanced.

    Recently, the local Party organizations have completed the transformation in the problems of the Party's organizational and political work, thus further strengthening the ties with the masses of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. The central attention of the Party organizations is more focused on the correct combination of political work and economic work, on the communist education of the masses, and on giving play to their creative initiative in the struggle to fulfill state plans and tasks. Consolidating the achievements, improving the level of organizational and political work among the masses – this is the task of the local Party organizations.

    The draft amendment to the Party Constitution submitted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) for discussion at the 19th Party Congress is permeated with great concern for further strengthening the Party's ties with the masses. The draft stipulates that members must

    "Constantly consolidate ties with the masses, promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, explain the Party's policies and resolutions to the non-Party masses, and always remember that the strength and invincibility of our Party lies in its inseparable flesh-and-blood ties with the people."

    This requirement of the draft amendment to the Party Constitution has been unanimously approved by the masses of Party members. When discussing the draft Party Constitution at meetings of the Party's grassroots organizations and at Party representative conferences, the Communist Party members put forward ways to further strengthen the ties between the Party organs and the masses. Those leaders who forgot their primary task of constantly consolidating ties with the masses, alienated themselves from the masses, and did not listen to the opinions of the masses were severely criticized. However, unfortunately, we can still encounter such individual cases.

    The representatives of the Smolensk City Party Representative Conference severely criticized the staff of the City Party Committee, especially the First and Second Secretaries of the City Committee, Comrades Shamylin and Kazarinov, for being alienated from the Party's grassroots organizations and the broad masses of working people. These Party leaders, due to being caught up in various meetings and trivial economic affairs, hardly ever went to the grassroots Party organizations in enterprises and construction projects in the city, and rarely cared about the needs and demands of the working people. Considering the serious errors and shortcomings of Comrades Shamylin and Kazarinov in their work, the plenary meeting of the City Committee did not re-elect them as secretaries.

    The Party requires that every one of its staff members must carry out political work among the masses, explain events in domestic and international life to the working people, and systematically give political reports to the residents. Actively participating in workers' meetings and production discussions, conducting political education for the masses, and attracting them to participate in the struggle to realize the Party's policies are the primary tasks of every Communist Party member, regardless of his position. However, individual Party workers have forgotten this obligation of theirs.

    In July of this year, the office of the Alma-Ata City Party Committee entrusted Comrades Neklyudov, Iskakov, Belonosk, and Mukanovoy, Secretaries of the City Committee, to give political reports to the workers of the Kirov Factory. More than two months have passed, but none of the designated comrades has implemented the resolution of the City Committee. This year, not a single leading staff member of the City Committee has given a report to the factory workers. The staff of the City Committee rarely go to the factory collectives and do not truly study their lives and demands. They only have a superficial understanding of the situation in this large enterprise, so they cannot give the enterprise's work the influence it deserves.

    The lofty title of Communist Party member requires members to constantly go deep among the masses, give play to the creative initiative of the masses, expose and support all new and advanced things, and struggle against everything that is outdated and obsolete. Those Party workers who are alienated from the masses and attempt to lead only with resolutions and directives are not worthy of the people's high trust. Alienation from the masses, self-importance, arbitrariness, arrogance, and complacency will be universally condemned by us.

    Communist Party members bear glorious and important obligations. Communist Party members must be active fighters in implementing the Party's resolutions, must abide by the Party and the state's discipline, unfold self-criticism and criticism from below, tirelessly fight to eliminate shortcomings in their work, and resolutely implement the Party's instructions on correctly selecting cadres. In order to faithfully fulfill these obligations, Communist Party members must constantly consolidate their ties with the masses.

    Our Party has been able to achieve great victories in the struggle for communist construction because it is at all times guided in all aspects by the invincible doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, and because it relies on the broadest masses of the people in all its activities. Comrade Stalin said: "If the Communist Party members close themselves in their own shells, separate themselves from the non-Party members with a wall, then they will ruin the whole cause. One of the reasons why the Communist Party members have won victory in the struggle for socialism, their glory spread all over their bodies, and the enemies of communism have been defeated and scattered is that the Communist Party members are good at absorbing outstanding members from the non-Party masses to participate in the work, because they are good at drawing strength from the broad non-Party masses, because they are good at uniting the broad non-Party activists around their Party."

    The discussion of the draft amendment to the Party Constitution shows that the requirement to constantly consolidate the ties between Party members and the masses has received a warm response among the broad masses of Party members. The Party organizations have more widely unfolded political and organizational work among the masses, mobilizing them to give play to their creative enthusiasm in order to fulfill the great tasks facing the state in the new five-year plan.

    Millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, inspired by the Lenin-Stalin Party, spare no effort and labor to realize the great plan of communist construction.

    经常巩固与群众的联系
    ——九月五日苏联真理报社论
    在我国准备联共（布）党第十九次代表大会的这些日子里，特别表现出共产党和广大劳动群众的不可分割的联系。苏联人民在迎接代表大会时，更为紧密地团结在自己的亲爱的党、党的中央委员会和伟大的领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围。在社会主义竞赛的新高涨中，鲜明地表现出全体人民对党的热爱和对党的伟大事业的无限忠诚。
    伟大的列宁在论及无产阶级政党的力量的泉源时写道：如果党善于“与最广大劳动群众——首先是与无产者劳动群众，但同样也与非无产者劳动群众——联系，接近，在某种程度上甚至可以说是与他们溶成一片”，那末，它就会是不可战胜的。列宁教导说，党必须逐日赢得群众对自己的信任，必须用自己的政策和自己的工作取得群众对自己的拥护，并帮助群众根据本身的经验确信党的政策的正确性。
    在国家的社会主义改造的巨大工作过程中，党在斯大林同志领导下不断巩固和增强着与群众的联系，号召和引导他们参加实现党的口号和决议的斗争。党的事业在我国早已成为全民的事业了。广大非党群众把党看作自己的党，自己的亲近的和亲爱的党，他们密切关心党的壮大与巩固，他们自愿地把自己的命运委诸于党的领导。
    苏联人民根据多年的经验确信党的政策的正确性，确信列宁、斯大林党的全部活动都是忘我地为人民服务的。党和群众的不可分割的联系是共产主义的新胜利的可靠保证。“通常，可以认为，——斯大林同志说，——当布尔什维克和广大人民群众保持着联系时，他们就会是不可战胜的。”
    党时刻要求每一个党员：必须与群众建立密切的联系，经常巩固这种联系，善于倾听群众的意见和了解他们的迫切需要，随时准备着不仅仅教育群众而且向群众学习。在现在的条件下，当我国在实现着逐步由社会主义到共产主义的过渡的时候，当共产主义建设的伟大任务的实现需要动员人民的一切创造力量的时候，这一要求的意义就特别地增强了。
    近来，地方党的组织完成了在党的组织和党的政治工作问题方面的转变，从而就更为加强了与工人、集体农民、知识分子群众的联系。党组织的中心注意力更大地转向政治工作和经济工作的正确结合，转向对群众的共产主义教育，和发挥他们在完成国家计划和任务的斗争中的创造的积极性。巩固既得的成绩，提高在群众中的组织工作和政治工作水平，——这就是地方党组织的任务。
    联共（布）党中央委员会提交第十九次党代表大会讨论的党章修正草案，贯穿着对于进一步加强党与群众的联系的伟大的关怀。草案规定党员必须
    “经常巩固与群众的联系，及时反映劳动人民的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于它和人民有着不可分割的血肉联系。”
    党章修正草案的这一项要求，得到党员群众的一致赞同。共产党员们在党的基层组织会议上和党代表会议上讨论党章草案时，提出了进一步加强党的机关和群众的联系的办法。那些忘记自己的首要任务——经常巩固与群众的联系——脱离群众、不倾听群众意见的领导人受到了严厉的批评。然而，可惜我们还能遇到个别的这类事情。
    斯莫连斯克市党代表会议的代表们严厉地指责了市党委会的工作人员，首先是市委会的第一书记和第二书记沙米林同志和卡扎林诺夫同志，因为他们脱离党的基层组织和广大劳动群众。这些党的领导人因陷于各种会议和细小的经济事务，几乎完全不到企业的和该市建设工程中的基层党组织里去，并且很少关心劳动人民的需要和要求。市委会的全体会议考虑到沙米林同志和卡扎林诺夫同志在工作中的严重错误和缺点，所以没有再选举他们作书记。
    党要求它的每一个工作人员必须在群众中进行政治工作，向劳动人民解释国内和国际生活中的事件，系统地对居民作政治报告。积极参加工人的会议和生产讨论会，对群众进行政治教育，吸引他们参加为实现党的政策的斗争，是每一个共产党员的首要任务，不管他在什么工作岗位上。然而，个别党的工作人员忘记了自己的这一项义务。
    今年七月，阿尔马——阿金斯克市党委会办公处委托市委书记聂克留多夫同志、依斯卡可夫同志、别洛诺斯克同志和木卡诺沃依同志对基洛夫工厂的工人作政治报告。两个多月已经过去了，然而，被指定的同志中谁也没有执行市委会的决议。在今年里，市委会没有一个领导工作人员曾向工厂工人作过报告。市委会的工作人员很少到工厂集体中去，也不真正研究他们的生活和要求，他们对于这个大企业里的事情的情况只有表面的了解，所以不能给予该企业的工作以应有的影响。
    共产党员的崇高的称号要求党员经常深入群众，发挥群众的创造积极性，揭发和支持一切新的和先进的事物，与一切陈旧的、过时的东西进行斗争。那些脱离群众、企图只用决议和指令来进行领导的党的工作人员是不配得到人们的高度信任的。脱离群众，自高自大，刚愎自用，骄傲自满，将受到我们的普遍的指责。
    共产党员承担着光荣的、重要的义务。共产党员必须是实现党的决议的积极战士，必须遵守党和国家的纪律，展开自我批评和自下而上的批评，不倦地为消灭工作中的缺点而斗争，坚决执行党关于正确选拔干部的指示。为了忠诚地执行这些义务，共产党员必须经常巩固与群众的联系。
    我们党在共产主义建设的斗争中所以能够得到伟大的胜利，因为它在各方面时刻都受着马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的无往而不胜的学说指导，因为它在其全部活动中都依靠着最广大的人民群众。斯大林同志说：“如果共产党员把自己封闭在自己的甲壳里，用一道墙壁和非党员隔离开来，那末他们就会葬送全部事业。共产党人在为社会主义斗争中获得了胜利，荣光遍体，而共产主义的敌人却已被打得落花流水，其原因之一，也就是因为共产党人善于吸收非党员群众中的优秀分子来参加工作，因为他们善于在广大非党员群众中间汲取力量，因为他们善于把广大非党员积极分子团结在自己党的周围”。
    对党章修正草案的讨论表明，关于经常巩固党员与群众的联系的一项要求，在广大党员群众中得到热烈的响应。党的组织更广泛地展开了群众中的政治和组织工作，动员他们为完成国家在新五年计划中所面临的巨大任务而发挥创造的热情。
    千百万工人、集体农民、知识分子在列宁—斯大林党的鼓舞下，毫不吝惜地付出自己的力量和劳动以便实现共产主义建设的伟大计划。
