    Women Unite and Fight to Defend Peace in the Asian and Pacific Region

    The Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference is about to open in Beijing, the capital of New China! This conference will demonstrate the firm will and urgent desire for peace of 1.6 billion men and women. For us women, this conference is of even greater significance. Because the mothers who are responsible for nurturing human life need a peaceful and happy life even more urgently.
    The deep suffering of Korean women and children is well known. According to the report of the International Democratic Women's Investigation Team on the atrocities of the American army invading Korea, a year ago, 300,000 Korean children had already been sacrificed in the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea. Since January of this year, the American aggressors have even been conducting large-scale germ warfare in Korea and China. Now, the American aggressors are continuing to use brutal means such as indiscriminate bombing and throwing gasoline bombs to deal with the already destroyed Korean cities, massacring the peaceful people, women and children of Korea. From July 11th to 12th of this year, in the residential area of ​​Pyongyang alone, more than 400 American aircraft dropped more than 6,000 napalm bombs, landmine bombs, fragmentation bombs and time bombs, killing and wounding more than 6,000 women, old people and children.
    In Japan, which has become a military base for American imperialism, large numbers of women and children are struggling on the verge of starvation. The huge military expenses forced upon them by the American occupiers, the increase in unemployment, and the bankruptcy of the rural economy have forced many Japanese women into prostitution, and many children have become child laborers or even vagrants on the streets. In the rural areas of Japan, about 20,000 parents a year are forced by hunger to sell their own children as commodities. In 1951, the number of registered births in Japan decreased by 100,000 compared with 1950, and the birth rate fell to the lowest level in 50 years. Now, American imperialists are accelerating the militarization of Japan, attempting to drive the Japanese people to become cannon fodder for their expansion of aggression, plunging the lives of Japanese women and children into even more miserable situations.
    In the United States, due to the policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, the US government is spending more than 80 percent of this year's budget on military expenditures. Truman cut this year's housing construction plans and prepared barracks for young people; Truman canceled the peaceful and happy education of children and replaced it with war clamor and brutal and terrifying education such as racial discrimination, which made the innocent and simple minds of children suffer greatly from poisoning and destruction. This has brought great pain and misfortune to tens of millions of American mothers.
    Women and children in all countries in Asia and the Pacific region are directly or indirectly suffering from the threat of war. In order to prevent the smiles on our children's faces from being taken away by the whistling of shells, in order to prevent our happy and peaceful families from being destroyed by the flames of war, in order for us to live freely under the sunshine of peace, free from any oppression and threats of war, we, the 800 million mothers and women in the Asian and Pacific region, must direct all our hatred towards the war merchants who deliberately sabotage peace! We must unite all our forces to oppose war and defend peace! Although we have different races, different languages, and different religious beliefs, we have a bridge that connects us – we all love peace, and we all love children and families. Let us unite more closely and act more effectively under such a great common wish to fight for the defense of peace in the Asian and Pacific region.

    妇女们团结起来，为保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平而斗争
    李德全
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在新中国的首都北京召开了！这个会议将表明十六亿男女人民要求和平的坚强意志和迫切愿望。对于我们妇女来说，这个会议更具有特别重要的意义。因为负责孕育人类生命的母亲，更迫切地需要和平幸福的生活。
    朝鲜妇女和儿童所遭受的深重的灾难，是人所共知的。根据国际民主妇女对侵朝美军暴行调查团的报告，在一年之前，已经有三十万朝鲜儿童牺牲在美帝国主义的侵朝战争中。今年一月开始，美国侵略者更在朝鲜和我国进行了大规模的细菌战。现在，美国侵略者正在对朝鲜继续用狂轰滥炸、投汽油弹等残暴手段来对付业已被毁坏了的朝鲜城市，屠杀朝鲜的和平的人民、妇女和儿童。今年七月十一日至十二日两天中，仅在平壤市居民区，就有四百多架美国飞机投下了六千多颗凝固汽油弹、地雷弹、杀伤弹和定时炸弹，杀伤了六千多名妇女、老人和儿童。
    成为美帝国主义者军事基地的日本，大批妇女和儿童正在饥饿死亡线上挣扎。美国占领者强迫负担的巨额军事费用，失业人数的增加和农村经济的破产，逼使许多日本妇女沦为娼妓，许多儿童充当童工甚至流浪街头。在日本的农村中，一年约有两万多个父母为饥饿所迫，不得不把亲生子女当做商品出卖。一九五一年日本登记出生的婴儿较一九五○年减少了十万，婴儿的出生率降落到五十年来的最低水平。现在，美帝国主义者正在加速日本的军国主义化，企图驱使日本人民充当它扩张侵略的炮灰，使日本妇女和儿童的生活陷于更悲惨的境地。
    在美国，由于扩军备战的政策，美国政府把今年预算中的百分之八十以上用于军事预算。杜鲁门削减了今年建筑房屋的计划而给青年们准备营房；杜鲁门取消了对儿童的和平幸福的教育而代之以战争叫嚣、种族歧视等残暴、恐怖的教育，使儿童们天真纯朴的心灵饱受毒害与摧残，这就给成千万的美国母亲们带来了巨大的痛苦和祸害。
    全亚洲和太平洋区域的国家的妇女和儿童，正直接或间接地遭受着战争的威胁。为了使我们的儿童脸上的笑容，不会被炮弹的呼啸声所夺去，为了使我们幸福安宁的家庭不被战火所破坏，为了使我们能在和平阳光的普照下过自由的、不受任何压迫、不受战争威胁的生活，我们全亚洲和太平洋区域的八亿母亲们和妇女们，必须把我们的一切仇恨向着那蓄意破坏和平的战争贩子！必须把我们的一切力量团结起来，反对战争，保卫和平！尽管我们种族不同，语言不同，宗教信仰不同，但我们有着一个相互沟通的桥梁——我们都热爱和平，我们都热爱孩子和家庭。让我们就在这样一个伟大的共同意愿之下，更亲密地团结起来，更有效地行动起来，为保卫亚洲及太平洋区域的和平而斗争。
