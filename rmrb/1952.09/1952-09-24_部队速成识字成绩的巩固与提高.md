    祁建华's accelerated literacy method embodies the "accelerated, practical, yet standardized" approach to cultural education in the army. It encapsulates the rich experience of the People's Liberation Army in mass-line teaching over the years, leverages the learning strengths of adults, and begins to explore the rules of learning Chinese characters. It has produced significant and positive results in literacy education.

    The accelerated literacy method and other excellent creations in cultural education have spurred a new record movement in the army's cultural education and initiated a series of reforms.

    It has made us realize that Chinese characters, with their long history, are not insurmountable and can be mastered in a relatively short period under certain conditions.

    Consequently, we have clarified a step-by-step approach to eliminating illiteracy: In the PLA's elementary Chinese education, the first step is to promote the accelerated literacy method to achieve initial "four skills" (reading, speaking, writing, and using) of more than 1,500 common characters. On this basis, further instruction in selected texts will lay a solid foundation in characters, words, and sentences, and cultivate reading, writing, and critical thinking skills.

    The ability to leverage favorable conditions in teaching and gradually implement correct reforms is the foundation for accelerating our cultural education. For example:

    First, our students are adults of worker and farmer origin. Adults have clearer goals and stronger self-awareness than children. They are rich in knowledge from their daily lives and revolutionary struggles, resulting in stronger comprehension and association skills. In other words, although they lack book knowledge, they possess considerable practical knowledge. For example, in language, they already have relatively rich thoughts and language; in arithmetic, they also have rudimentary numerical concepts and basic mental calculation skills. Therefore, as long as we can provide them with appropriate self-study "crutches" (such as phonetic symbols in accelerated literacy and formulas in arithmetic), and skillfully use their existing knowledge for education, leveraging their comprehension and association skills, they can "infer three things from one example and understand things of the same category."

    Second, in our teaching methods, we strive to integrate theory with practice, seek patterns, focus on key points, and gradually improve, which can "achieve twice the result with half the effort." For instance, in accelerated literacy, "using phonetic symbols to assist literacy," "massive blitz followed by gradual digestion," and "breaking down the difficulties of the four skills and gradually mastering them"; in arithmetic education, "using formulas," "combining written calculation with mental calculation," and "arranging and solving difficulties," are all consistent with the requirements of the subjects and the actual situation and characteristics of the students, making them tools for achieving "acceleration."

    Third, under the leadership and guarantee of the Party and the administration, we promote the teachers' high level of guidance and the students' high level of learning enthusiasm. This is an excellent tradition of the People's Liberation Army's education work. It requires excellent teachers and a broad mass line. Teaching plans are formulated in advance for each course, teachers are trained in phases, and educational preparation meetings are held on time. It emphasizes that teachers should give good lectures and also provide in-depth tutoring and diligently correct homework, combining teacher guidance with mass self-study assistance, and launching revolutionary heroism in both teaching and learning to continuously improve teaching efficiency.

    That is to say, "acceleration" cannot come out of thin air. We must address the requirements of cultural education, the situation and characteristics of the students, improve teaching methods, and carry out intensive work in a down-to-earth and pragmatic manner to achieve our goals.

    That is to say, we must anticipate some characteristics of "accelerated" education: "Acceleration" is prone to being superficial, so we must emphasize results; "acceleration" is a blitz, so we must pay attention to digestion and consolidation; accelerated education is a mass movement, currently without a complete set of "specifications," so we must be careful to prevent deviations. It is wrong to regard the "acceleration" of cultural education as an easy task or to make unrealistically high and urgent demands, and formalism and championship-ism in teaching are also wrong.

    That is to say, 祁建华's accelerated literacy method is a good method for eliminating illiteracy, and there should be no more doubts about this. However, whether it can achieve truly consolidated results depends on practical work.

    Then, what requirements and goals should and can accelerated literacy achieve? The General Political Department of the Military Commission stipulates that: 1. Students should be able to recognize, basically speak, and mostly write more than 1,500 common characters; 2. Students should be able to roughly read the PLA's elementary Chinese textbooks (Volumes 1 to 4); 3. Students should be able to write a simple paragraph. That is, accelerated literacy should achieve the initial "four skills" of commonly used characters (not just the "two skills" of reading and speaking), enabling students to have rudimentary reading and writing skills and basically escape the state of "illiteracy" in language.

    To achieve the above standards, consolidation work should be firmly grasped in the process of promoting the accelerated literacy method. To this end:

    First, attention should be paid to review and consolidation during the blitz of new characters. This requires appropriately dividing students into two or three classes based on their literacy level before the blitz of new characters. Teach faster for those who already know some characters; teach slower for those who are illiterate or know very few characters. Throughout the blitz, it is necessary to take care of the majority and control the pace, not to show off one's ability. Do not engage in speed competitions without regard for effectiveness, and do not blindly accelerate the pace based on a few advanced individuals, preventing "massive blitz, massive dropout."

    Many units have also adopted the method of segmented blitz and segmented review and consolidation. That is, after blitzing a batch of new characters, a period of time is set aside for review and consolidation, slightly sorted out, and then continued progress. Instead of blitzing one thousand five, six hundred or two thousand characters in one breath, causing students to be "overwhelmed."

    In addition, in the process of blitzing new characters to first achieve reading and preliminary speaking, a small amount of textbook reading and writing activities should also be supplemented. Inspire students to analyze some character formation rules and radicals to "classify new characters" to facilitate the recognition of character shapes, help memory, and do a good job of "moving" (being able to read and speak new characters without phonetic symbols, which is called "moving") and consolidating literacy. That is to say, the accelerated literacy method advocates "breaking down the difficulties of the four skills and overcoming them one by one," but it is not "isolating difficulties" without contact. The phonetic single-character list compiled by the General Political Department of the Military Commission is arranged according to the new characters in the textbook, and its advantage is that it is convenient to combine with the textbook for reading and segmented review in the blitz of new characters.

    More importantly, the activities of reading, writing, and paragraph writing should be regarded as important steps in the accelerated literacy method. After two steps of teaching, learning phonetic symbols and blitzing new characters, the initial reading and speaking of one thousand five, six hundred single characters (without phonetic symbols) can be achieved. However, the characters recognized at this time are still not consolidated, the understanding of word meanings is not rich, the vocabulary is small, most of the characters cannot be written, and reading and writing are even more difficult; and there are always some "dropouts." If the work of consolidation and improvement such as reading, writing, and paragraph writing is ignored, the standard cannot be reached. It is dangerous for illiterate people to eat too much at the beginning of their studies without digesting it. Being satisfied with the partial results of the blitz of new characters and no longer continuing to consolidate and expand literacy achievements, and develop the "four skills," saying
    "blitzing two thousand characters is better than a college student," is halfway abandoning the accelerated literacy. Finally, even the
    "preliminary two skills" obtained in the previous step will forget a large part.

    Reading should be based on textbooks, supplemented by other popular reading materials. Conduct guided reading, silent reading, and guide the essentials of reading. Organize extracurricular reading and conduct free silent reading. In reading activities, not only should the characters be read accurately, but also pay attention to words and link words into sentences. In the case of reading more fluently and smoothly, further understand the general meaning of the text, words, and sentences.

    Writing is a "difficulty" that must be solved seriously. According to the teaching experience of 曾端仪 and others, generally teach how to hold a pen, teach basic strokes, teach stroke order, pay special attention to analyzing character formation rules, grasp radicals, and help students memorize. First, do a lot of copying, then switch to dictation and free writing. In writing, you should also pay attention to copying words (two-character words) to further distinguish homophones, expand the understanding of word meanings, and enrich vocabulary. The materials for copying and dictation are generally mainly taken from textbooks.

    Paragraph writing in this period is only the beginning of the application of words, and the requirements should not be too high. In order to solve the difficulty of "having something to say in the heart, but not knowing where to start" when starting to write, generally first conduct "question-and-answer writing" (the teacher asks questions, and the students answer in writing), "starting writing" (the teacher starts, and the students continue to write), and then expand "free writing" (write whatever you see, write whatever you think, etc.), launch writing letters, writing wall newspaper drafts, etc. The teacher must check and correct them gradually to correct typos.

    Teaching phonetic symbols, blitzing new characters, and reading, writing, and paragraph writing activities for further consolidating literacy constitute a complete teaching process of the accelerated literacy method. It must be implemented effectively to meet the requirements before the accelerated literacy can be concluded.

    Regarding the issue of teaching time, the General Political Department of the Military Commission stipulated in the article "Introduction to Accelerated Literacy Method" that accelerated literacy requires 300 hours. Today, it still seems appropriate in general. This is already quite tight and cannot be "accelerated" any further.

    In order to enable the soldiers of the army to receive complete primary language education, after accelerated literacy, they must continue to study considerable Chinese textbooks in order to further master and use language tools, cultivate and improve reading, writing, and thinking skills, until they reach a Chinese proficiency equivalent to that of a senior elementary school graduate.

    In the teaching of Chinese textbooks, we strive to enrich students' knowledge of characters, words, and sentences in a planned and step-by-step manner so that they can appropriately use vocabulary to write relatively complete and smooth sentences. Emphasize doing a good job of
    "basic training" in characters, words, and sentences, and oppose asking to write beautiful articles too early and too high and distinguishing the "genre" of articles, etc.

    Also, due to the characteristics of adult learning, especially because of the "capital" after accelerated literacy, our Chinese textbook teaching is also possible to be accelerated.

    The army's Chinese textbook teaching is currently being trialed along the following directions: First, grasp the key points and gradually improve. Focus on explaining the text thoroughly and guiding homework. Divide the existing texts into key lessons and supplementary lessons, group them into units, and set out the key requirements for each unit to achieve gradual improvement. Second, combine lectures, reading, and writing. Third, advocate familiar reading, extensive reading, and extensive writing, make full use of students' experience, inspire students to think, and strengthen the guidance of self-study assistance. We plan to complete this stage of Chinese textbook teaching in 400 hours.

    Finally, let's talk about the leadership of teaching work.

    Formalism and champion-ism are obstacles to the smooth implementation of the accelerated literacy method. This deviation has been manifested in some troops as: 1. Unilaterally emphasizing shortening the time, regardless of the effect; 2. Unrealistically increasing the pace and increasing the task (soldiers call it "exorbitant taxes"); 3. Exaggerating achievements, concealing shortcomings, using advanced examples to replace the general, only focusing on the progress of a few, regardless of a large number of dropouts; 4. Satisfying with the temporary blitz results, not seeking digestion and consolidation and firmly laying the foundation; 5. Cutting corners, only seeking quantity and not paying attention to content (such as having two thousand characters in quantity, but the "moving" and consolidation degree are extremely poor), and graduating prematurely and too quickly.

    It can be seen that the healthy development of the literacy campaign, the consolidation and improvement of accelerated literacy, the key lies in strengthening the leadership of teaching.

    In the past six months, we have had the following points of experience in the leadership of teaching in the literacy campaign:

    First, try to get a relatively standardized set of regulations and methods. Even if it is not very mature, there must be a "draft" first, so that everyone can follow it and continuously seek development. Clarify the graduation standards and requirements of each level
    "specifications," and must not arbitrarily increase or decrease them. Emphasize that "acceleration" is for the sake of "success." Formulate teaching plans, including principles, purposes, steps, key points, methods, time, etc., and must not be unique and violate the principles of unrealistic "creation." Hold on to each teaching stage
    "checkpoint," strictly implement the examination, promotion, upgrade, and graduation system, and do not allow passing without meeting the requirements, preventing "half-baked."

    Second, unfold with preparation and steps. The primary task of leaders at all levels is to gain experience through typical experiments. Gradually promote from point to surface. There must be concrete guidance and not just motivational work. Seriously prepare the teachers.
    In order to do a good job in the work of teachers, the troops have transferred a large number of cadres and staff from various departments to serve as cultural teachers in companies and schools, launched the movement to respect teachers and love students, strengthened the combination of commanders and fighters of workers and peasants origin and intellectuals, and generally opened accelerated literacy teacher training classes using the method of demonstration teaching. In addition, leaders at all levels, the Party branches of the companies, and the Communist Youth League have carried out a series of work. Such as establishing meritorious models, education preparation meetings, roving lecture groups, establishing company teacher groups, democratic evaluation of teaching and learning, and grasping political and ideological education. Promoting the accelerated literacy movement is also an ideological transformation movement for cultural teachers. Those who cannot put down their airs, cannot combine with workers, peasants and soldiers, are not good at linking theory with practice in teaching, are not good at infusing political work in teaching, are only teachers in the classroom, and do not act as guides for self-study assistance, are not good teachers, and therefore will not have good teaching results.

    Third, strengthen inspection and correct deviations in a timely manner. Leaders at all levels in the troops have cultural education inspection teams, which regularly understand and grasp the teaching situation of the troops, discover problems, and summarize experience. Leading cadres at all levels can also personally check. In addition, holding teaching representative meetings is also a good way to understand the situation in a timely manner and implement the leadership policy.

    The People's Liberation Army has many experiences in promoting the accelerated literacy method throughout the army. We have not yet had time to study and summarize them. The above is only some immature experience and opinions on the consolidation and improvement of accelerated literacy for your reference.

    部队速成识字成绩的巩固与提高
    姜思毅
    祁建华速成识字法，在识字教育上，具体体现了“速成的、联系实际的、但又是正规的”部队文化教育方针，集中了人民解放军多年来教学工作走群众路线的丰富经验，发挥了成年人学习上的长处，并开始摸索着学习汉字的一些规律，在识字教育上产生了巨大而良好的效果。
    速成识字法及其他文化教育方面的优良创造，带动部队展开了文化教育的新纪录运动，并开始引起部队文化教育一系列的革新。
    它使我们认识到：有悠久历史的汉字，在一定的条件之下，并不是万分难学、不可以用较短的时间攻破的。
    由此，我们又明确了一个扫除文盲的步骤：部队小学语文教育，第一步要推行速成识字法，达到一千五、六百个以上常用单字的初步“四会”（会读、会讲、会写、会用）；在此基础上，进一步再教一定的课文，打下字、词、语句的相当基础，培养阅读、写作与思考能力。
    善于利用教学方面的有利条件，逐步地进行正确的改革，是我们文化教育得以速成的基础。例如：
    第一、我们的教学对象是工农出身的成年人。成年人学习，较之儿童目的明确、自觉性强，在日常生活与革命斗争中，知识丰富，因而理解力与联想力也强。也就是说，他们虽然缺乏书本知识，但却有相当的实践知识。例如在语文方面，已经有比较丰富的思想和语言；在算术方面，也有粗浅的数字概念和初步的心算能力。因此只要能给他们以适当的辅助自学的“拐棍”（如速成识字中的注音符号，算术中的口诀），善于运用他们已有的丰富知识进行教育，发挥其理解力、联想力，就可“举一反三，触类旁通”。
    第二、我们在教学方法上，力求结合实际、找寻规律，重点突击，逐步提高，就可以“事半功倍”。举如在速成识字中，“以注音符号辅助识字”，
    “大量突击、逐渐消化”，“分散四会难点，逐步占有”；算术教育中“运用口诀”，“笔算结合心算”，“排列与解决难点”等等，既合乎这种学科的要求，又合乎学员的实际情况与特点，成为争取“速成”的手段。
    第三、在党与行政的领导和保证下，发扬教员高度的指导作用与学员高度的学习积极性。这是人民解放军教育工作的优良传统。要求有优良的教员，又要求有广泛的群众路线。教每一门课程，都事先订有教学方案，分期训练教员，按时召开教育准备会。既强调教员要讲好课，又要求教员深入辅导，勤改作业，使教员指导与群众的自学互助结合起来，发起教学两方面的革命英雄主义，不断地提高教学效率。
    这就是说，“速成”绝不能凭空而来，要针对文化教育的要求，学员的情况、特点，改善教学方法，踏踏实实、实事求是地进行紧张的工作，才能达到目的。
    这就是说，我们要预见到“速成”教育的一些特点：“速成”容易粗糙，一定要强调效果：“速成”即是突击，一定要注意消化与巩固；速成教育是群众运动，目前尚无整套“规格”，一定要注意防止偏向。任何把文化教育的“速成”，当成轻而易举的事，或不切实际地去做过高过急的要求，在教学中表现形式主义、锦标主义都是错误的。
    这就是说，祁建华速成识字法是一个扫除文盲的好方法，这一点不能再有怀疑了，但是否能达到确实巩固的效果，还要看实际工作。
    那么，速成识字应当和可能达到什么要求与目的呢？军委总政治部宣传部规定为：一、会认、初步会讲并大部分会默写一千五百个以上的常用单字；二、能粗读部队初级小学语文课本（一至四册）；三、能写简单的一段话。这就是说，速成识字要达到常用单字的初步“四会”（不只是读与讲的“两会”），使学员具有粗浅的读写能力，在语文方面基本上脱离“文盲”的状态。
    为达到上述标准，在推行速成识字法的过程中，应切实抓紧巩固工作。为此：
    首先，就要在突击生字中注意复习与巩固。这就要：在突击生字之前，依据学员识字多少，适当地分编为两、三个班次。对已识一些字的，教快一些；对不识字或识字很少的，教慢一些。在整个突击中，都要照顾多数，掌握进度，既要发挥战斗的突击的作用，又要实事求是，不逞能耐。不做不问效果的速度竞赛，不可以少数先进分子为准，盲目地过高地加快速度，防止“大量突击、大量掉队”。
    许多单位还采取了分段突击分段复习巩固的办法。即突击一批生字以后，留出一段时间复习巩固，略作整理，再行继续前进。不是一口气的突击一千五、六百字到两千字，使学员“吃不消”。
    此外，在突击生字先求会读与初步会讲的过程中，还应辅以少量的课本阅读与写字活动。启发学员分析一些字形规律、部首偏旁进行“生字编班”，以便于认识字形，帮助记忆，做好“搬家”（脱离注音符号能够读讲生字，谓之“搬家”）与巩固识字。这就是说，速成识字法主张“分散四会难点、各个突破”，并不是“孤立难点”互不联系。军委总政治部宣传部所编注音单字表，按课本生字排列，它的好处就在于在突击生字中便于结合课本，进行阅读与分段复习。
    更重要的，就是把阅读、写字、写话的活动，当做速成识字法的重要步骤。经过学习注音符号拼音与突击生字两个步骤的教学之后，可以达到一千五、六百个单字的初步会读与会讲（离开注音符号）。但这时所识的字还是不巩固的，占有字义也不丰富，词汇很少，大部分的字还不会写，阅读、写话更有困难；且总有若干“掉队”的。如果忽略了阅读、写字、写话等巩固提高的工作，就不能达到标准。文盲刚开始学习，就吃得过饱，不去消化一下是危险的。满足于突击生字的部分收效，不再继续巩固与扩大识字成果，发展“四会”，说什么
    “突击两千字，赛过大学生”，这对于速成识字来讲，乃是半途而废；最后，连前一步骤所获得的
    “初步两会”也会忘掉一大部分。
    阅读应以课本为主，辅以其他通俗读物。进行领读、默读和指导阅读要领。并组织课外阅读，进行自由默读。在阅读活动中，不只要读准字，并且要注意词，把词联成句。在读得较为流利顺口的情况下，进一步体会课文、词句大意。
    写字是一个“难点”，要认真地去解决它。根据曾端仪等人的教学经验，一般是教拿笔，教基本笔划，教笔顺，特别注意分析字形规律，掌握偏旁部首，帮助学员记忆。先行大量抄写，再行转入听写，自由写。在写字中还应注意抄词（双字词），以便进一步区别同音异义的字，扩大了解字义，丰富词汇。抄写与听写的材料，一般的主要取之于课本。
    写话在此一时期中，只是字词的开始应用，要求不应过高。为了解决开始写话时“心中有话，不知从何说起”的困难，一般地先进行一下“问答写话”（教员提问，学员笔答），“起头写话”（教员起个头，学员接着写下去），以后再展开“自由写话”（见啥写啥、想啥写啥等），发动写信、写墙报稿等等。教员必须进行检查修改，逐渐地去纠正错别字。
    教学注音符号，突击生字，和为进一步巩固识字所进行的阅读、写字与写话活动，组成速成识字法完整的教学过程。一定要切实实施，达到要求，才能将速成识字告一段落。
    关于教学时间问题，军委总政治部宣传部曾在“介绍速成识字法”一文中，规定速成识字需三百个小时，今天看来，大体上还是适当的。这已经是相当紧缩，不能再“速”了。
    为了使部队战士受到完全的初等语文教育，在速成识字之后，还要继续进行相当的语文课本的学习，以求进一步掌握与运用文字工具，培养与提高阅读、写作与思考能力，直到达到相当于高级小学毕业的语文水平。
    在语文课本教学中，力求有计划有步骤地丰富学员字、词、语句的知识，使能适当地运用词汇，写成比较完整和通顺的句子。强调做好字、词、句的
    “基本教练”，而反对过早过高地要求写漂亮文章以及分别文章的“体裁”等等。
    同样由于成年人学习的特点，特别是由于有了速成识字后的“本钱”，我们的语文课本教学也是可能速成的。
    部队的语文课本教学，目前正沿着以下的方向试行着：第一，掌握重点，逐步提高。有重点地讲透课文，指导作业。把现有课文，区分为重点课与辅助课，分组单元，订出各单元重点要求，求得逐步提高。第二，讲课、阅读、写作三者结合。第三，提倡熟读、多读、多写，充分利用学员经验，启发学员思考，加强自学互助的指导。我们准备用四百小时的时间，完成这一段语文课本教学。
    最后，谈一下教学工作的领导。
    形式主义与锦标主义是顺利推行速成识字法的障碍。这种偏向，在某些部队里曾表现为：一、片面强调缩短时间，不问效果；二、不切实际地加大进度，加重任务（战士称之为“苛捐杂税”）；三、夸大成绩，隐蔽缺点，以先进代一般，只管少数猛进，不管大量掉队；四、满足一时突击成果，不求消化巩固和切实打好基础；五、偷工减料，只求数量不重内容（如数量上有两千字，内容上“搬家”，巩固程度极差），过早过快地升班、结业等方面。
    由此可见，扫除文盲运动的健康发展，速成识字的巩固与提高，关键在于教学领导的加强。
    半年来，在扫除文盲运动的教学领导上，我们有如下几点体会：
    第一、尽可能搞一套比较正规的规定与办法。那怕是不太成熟，也要先有一个“草案”，便于大家遵循，不断地求发展，要明确各级结业标准、要求
    “规格”，不得任意提高与降低，强调“速”是为了“成”。制定教学方案，包括方针、目的、步骤、重点、方法、时间等，不得独出心裁，乱作违反方针不切实际的“创造”。把住各教学阶段的
    “关口”，严格考试、升班、升级、毕业制度，不达要求，不准过去，防止“夹生”。
    第二、有准备地有步骤地展开。各级领导首要通过典型实验取得经验。由点及面逐步推广。不可只有鼓动工作，没有具体指导。要切实准备好教员。
    为了做好教员工作，部队曾抽调了各部门的大批干部和工作人员，到连队中、学校中担任文化教员，开展了尊师爱生运动，密切了工农出身的指战员与知识分子的结合，并普遍用示范教学的办法开办了速成识字法教员训练班。此外，各级领导、连队的党支部、青年团都进行了一系列的工作。如立功创模，教育准备会，巡回讲授团，成立连队教员小组，民主评教评学，抓紧政治思想教育等等。推行速成识字运动，同时即是文化教员的思想改造运动。放不下架子，不能与工农兵结合，不善于在教学中联系实际，不善于在教学中贯注政治工作，只是课堂里的教员，不做自学互助的指导者，就不是一个好教员，因而也不会有很好的教学成绩。
    第三、加强检查，及时纠正偏向。部队里各级领导都设有文化教育检查队，经常地了解与掌握部队的教学情况，发现问题、总结经验。各级领导干部也能够亲自下手检查。此外，召开教学代表会，也是及时了解情况贯彻领导方针的好办法。
    人民解放军全军推行速成识字法，经验是不少的，我们还来不及加以研究和总结，以上仅是关于速成识字巩固提高问题上的一点不成熟的经验与意见，供大家参考。
