    Should Seriously and Conscientiously Create Comic Strips

    Editor: I recently saw a four-panel comic strip titled "Miner" in the August 1951 issue of the "Soviet Union" pictorial magazine, which truly depicted the life of Soviet miners. This made me think of the comic book "Coal" published by the Education Publishing House. I think this comic book is very unsatisfactory. The miner image in "Coal" is ugly and grotesque, and none of the coal mine's situation and surroundings are realistic. The author is relying on subjective speculation and "building a cart behind closed doors," which is completely irresponsible and shoddy. Such works are not limited to "Coal." The "Longxu Ditch" comic book published by Shanghai Zhengqi Bookstore is the same. In the second volume of this comic book, in picture eighteen, the residents are carrying the sewer pipes off, one on their shoulder and two on a pole, as if these pipes were made of cardboard. Also, in the sixth picture of the "Special-Class Hero Cui Jianguo" comic strip in "Cartoon" issue 15, the American soldier who was stabbed in the chest with a bayonet is standing upright. One can imagine that if the person being stabbed does not fall down, their head must be leaning forward or backward, and their body must lose its balance. The author's way of drawing only gives people a sense of unreality.

    Comic strip authors should strengthen their ideological transformation, deeply experience life, and must treat creation very seriously and conscientiously. Otherwise, as the demands of the masses increase, our works will be quickly abandoned. Chen Yanfan

    应严肃认真地创作连环画
    编辑同志：我最近在“苏联”画报一九五一年八月号上，看到了以“矿工”为题的，真正表现了苏联矿工生活的四幅连环画，使我联想到教育出版社出版的“煤”这本连环画来。我认为这本连环画是十分不能令人满意的。“煤”里的矿工形象表现得丑陋古怪，煤矿内的情况和周围的事物没有一样是真实的。作者是凭主观的猜测而在“闭门造车”，完全是不负责任的粗制滥造。这样的作品，也还不只是“煤”。上海正气书局出版的“龙须沟”连环画，同样如此。这套连环画的第二册十八图中，居民们搬下水道的泥管，竟肩上扛一个，担子挑二个，好像这些管子是马粪纸做的。还有，“漫画”第十五期“特等功臣崔建国”连环画第六图中，被刺刀刺进胸膛的美国兵，却身体直立。可以想像，被刺的人如果没有倒下去，头部必前俯或后仰，身体要失却重心。像作者那样的画法，只是给予人一种不真实的感觉。
    连环画作者，应当加强思想改造，深入体验生活，必须十分认真严肃地对待创作。否则，在群众的要求提高以后，我们的作品就将会很快地被遗弃的。　陈烟帆
