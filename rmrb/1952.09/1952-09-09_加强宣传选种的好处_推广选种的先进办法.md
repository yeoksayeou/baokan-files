To the Editor: The old saying goes, "A strong mother produces a fat son," meaning good seeds guarantee a good harvest. My father, who is over sixty years old, always asks everyone in the family who can work to go to the fields to select seeds during the autumn harvest. He says that seed selection has many benefits, it can reduce pests and diseases, and it can also make the seedlings grow neatly and mature uniformly. Initially, our family's seed selection method was "threshing ground selection." Seeds selected in this way still suffered from pests and diseases because when the crops were cut and brought to the threshing ground, the good ears and the diseased ears were mixed together, and the good ears were also infected with germs. Later, our family adopted two methods: "plot selection" and "ear selection." Plot selection is done when the crops are about to mature, by removing a few bad ears from a relatively good piece of farmland, and then cutting everything down to be used as seeds for next year. Ear selection is done by cutting good ears in the field and storing them separately, sometimes stringing them together with rope and hanging them on the wall, and then threshing them when sowing next year. Both of these methods involve selecting seeds in the field, but "ear selection" is more reliable.

Currently, some crops have already been harvested, and some are about to be harvested, which is the appropriate time for seed selection. However, as far as I know, some farmers still do not have the habit of selecting seeds, and some farmers do not know the proper methods of seed selection. Therefore, I suggest that rural cadres in various places should publicize the benefits of seed selection more, explaining that seed selection is a very important factor in increasing yield per unit area; in areas where seed selection has already been implemented, experience in seed selection should be summarized in a timely manner, and advanced methods of seed selection should be promoted, otherwise, "if seeds are not selected well, the yield will definitely be low."

    加强宣传选种的好处  推广选种的先进办法
　　编辑同志：农谚说“母壮子肥”，意思是好种籽必有好收成。我父亲是个六十多岁的老农民，每年在秋收时候，总要叫全家能劳动的人都到地里去选种。他说，选种的好处很多，能减少病虫害，又能使禾苗长的整齐，成熟一致。最初，我家选种的办法是“场选”。这样选下的种籽，仍然发生了病虫害，原因是庄稼割到场内，好穗子和病穗子混在一起，好穗也染上了病菌。后来我家采用“片选”和“穗选”两种办法。片选是在庄稼快要成熟的时候，在一片较好的庄稼地里，去掉少数不好的穗子，然后全部割下来当作明年的种籽。穗选是在田里把好穗子割下来单独收藏，有时用绳串起来挂到墙上，到明年下种时再脱粒。这两种办法，都是在田间选种，但“穗选”更可靠些。
　　目前各种庄稼，有的已经收割，有的即将收割，这正是选种的适当时期。但据我所知，有些农民还没有选种习惯，有些农民选种还不得法。因此，我建议各地农村干部要多多宣传选种的好处，说明选种是提高单位面积产量的一个很重要的因素；在已经实行选种的地区，应及时总结选种经验，推广选种的先进办法，否则“种子选不好，产量一定少”。    山西农学院学生　李志超
