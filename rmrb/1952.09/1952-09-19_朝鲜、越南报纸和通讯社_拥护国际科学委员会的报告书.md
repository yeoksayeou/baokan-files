    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th: The "Democratic Korea," "Labor News," "Korean People's Army," and all other newspapers published here have, for three consecutive days on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, published the preface, conclusion, and full text of the "Report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" in prominent positions on their front pages. At the same time, the newspapers also published reports of the signing ceremony of the report by the commission in Beijing, the press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists, and the commission's investigation into the facts of the US imperialists' bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The Korean Central News Agency broadcast the full text of the investigation report to all parts of Korea on the 17th. The Korean Central Broadcasting Station broadcast news about the commission's investigation results twice a day for three days on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, and successively published the preface, conclusion, and full text of the report.

    The publication of the report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China has aroused great attention from all sectors of the Korean people. People here believe that this document exposes the crimes of bacteriological warfare committed by the US aggressor troops in Korea and China to the world with undeniable facts and conclusive evidence. The publication of this important document is a heavy blow to the US imperialist policy of aggression and a great encouragement to the just struggle of the Korean and Chinese people against US aggression and in defense of Asian and world peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 18th: The Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the 17th on the report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China, entitled "Exposing the Criminals of Bacteriological Warfare." The commentary said: In addition to many other undeniable evidence, the report of the International Scientific Commission once again exposes the US bacteriological warfare criminals. The six scientists on the committee are all well-known bacteriology and biology experts. Their conclusions, based on careful investigation and scientific materials, make it impossible for the US imperialists to deny their crimes any longer. People all over the world see the ferocious face of the US imperialists more clearly than before, and their determination to fight for peace will be even stronger.

    The commentary went on to say: In addition to exposing the US military's bacteriological warfare, the committee's report also emphasized the brilliant victories achieved by the Korean and Chinese people in their active struggle to prevent epidemics and eliminate germ-carrying insects. The US imperialists, having suffered defeats on the front lines, tried to resort to germ-carrying insects to achieve their evil purposes; but the united strength of the Korean and Chinese people has once again subjected the US imperialists to new failures.

    The commentary concluded by saying: The Vietnamese people, like people all over the world, are deeply encouraged by the victorious struggle of the Korean and Chinese people against the bacteriological warfare of the US war-mongers. The Vietnamese people are confident that under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, they will surely smash all the brutal conspiracies of the French colonialists and the US interventionists and win the final victory in the war of resistance.

    朝鲜、越南报纸和通讯社
    拥护国际科学委员会的报告书
    【新华社平壤十七日电】此间出版的“民主朝鲜”、“劳动新闻”、“朝鲜人民军”及其他一切报纸，都在十五、十六、十七三日，连续以首页显著地位，发表了“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”的序言、结论和全文。同时，各报并刊登了该委员会在北京举行报告书签字仪式和中外记者招待会，以及该委员会在朝鲜和中国调查美帝国主义进行细菌战事实经过的报道。朝鲜中央通讯社在十七日向朝鲜全国各地广播了该调查报告书全文。朝鲜中央广播电台在十五、十六、十七三天中，每天广播两次有关该委员会调查结果的消息，并陆续发表了报告书的序言、结论和全文。
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书的发表，引起了朝鲜各界人民的极大注意。此间人士认为：这一文件以无可抵赖的事实和确凿证据，向全世界揭露了美国侵略军在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战罪行。这个重大文件的发表，是对美帝国主义侵略政策的沉重打击，也是对朝中两国人民反抗美国侵略、保卫亚洲及世界和平的正义斗争的巨大鼓舞。
    【新华社十八日讯】越南通讯社十七日就调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会的报告书，发表题为“揭露细菌战的罪犯”的评论。评论说：除了其他许多无法否认的证据以外，国际科学委员会的报告书又一次揭露了美国细菌战罪犯。委员会里六位科学家都是闻名的细菌学专家与生物学专家。他们根据仔细的调查与科学材料所得出的结论，使得美国帝国主义者再也不可能抵赖他们的罪行。全世界人民对于美国帝国主义者的凶恶面目比以前看得更加分明了，他们为争取和平而奋斗的决心也将更为加强。
    评论接着说：委员会的报告书除了揭露美军进行了细菌战以外，又强调指出了朝中人民在积极防疫与消灭带菌毒虫的斗争中所获得的辉煌胜利。美国帝国主义者在前线上吃了败仗，就想乞援于带菌的毒虫来达到他们的罪恶目的；但是朝中人民的联合力量，又使美国帝国主义者受到新的失败。
    评论最后说：越南人民与全世界人民一样，深为朝中人民反对美国战争贩子的细菌战的胜利斗争所鼓舞。越南人民深信：他们在胡志明主席的领导下，一定可以粉碎法国殖民者与美国干涉者的一切凶残的阴谋，取得抗战的最后胜利。
