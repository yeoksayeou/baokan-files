Letter Excerpts

    It is Necessary to Allow the Use of Simplified Characters
    A large-scale cultural learning movement is underway in the army. Some units have completed crash literacy courses and have begun formal language teaching. In language teaching, we have found a problem: many students write many simplified characters in their homework, and some characters have several different simplified forms. Many cultural instructors have different opinions on whether simplified characters should be corrected and whether there should be a unified standard. We hope you will forward this to the relevant authorities for research.
    Yunnan Military Region, Political Department, Liu Yecheng
    Editor's Note: In the teaching process, students should be allowed to write simplified characters. The standard for using simplified characters should be the most widely used characters among the masses. When there are several different ways to write a simplified character, cultural instructors should choose a reasonable and common one to teach to the students.

    Guyuan County Combines Technology Transfer with Vigorously Promoting New Agricultural Tools
    In late August, Guyuan County, Chahar Province, held a new agricultural tools training class, attended by more than 200 village cadres, representatives, and labor models. The training class focused on publicizing the relationship between new agricultural tools and organization, and used field experiments to teach the use and simple repair of the seven-inch walking plow. After this education, the vast number of farmers competed to borrow walking plows, and a total of 954 units have now been lent out throughout the county. Farmers said, "If the People's Government had taught us the technology earlier, we would have used the new walking plow long ago." Everyone requested that this batch of new agricultural tools be delivered as soon as possible for use during the autumn plowing.

    Farmers Urgently Demand the Promotion of New Childbirth Methods
    Since liberation, under the advocacy and assistance of the People's Government, some old midwives in rural areas have learned new methods of childbirth after short-term training, and the results have been very good, greatly reducing infant mortality. However, in many rural areas of Changping County, Hebei Province, old methods of childbirth are still used. Taking Dongdaxingzhuang as an example, the midwives have not learned new methods of childbirth, and the infant mortality rate is still very high. This not only increases the suffering of women and the misfortune of families, but also prevents the complete elimination of certain feudal superstitious ideas among the masses. Therefore, the farmers in this village urgently hope that the People's Government can promote the new childbirth methods to the village.
    I believe that this is a common demand of the vast number of farmers. I hope that the People's Governments in various places can actively transform the old midwives and train them to learn new methods of childbirth to meet the needs of the farmers.

    The Masses Should Be Educated Not to Let Livestock Graze Along Railways
    When the villagers of Jilalin in Ergun Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, were transporting timber for the Wunuer Work Station, horses were repeatedly killed or injured by trains. The reason for this was that after their work was completed, they put the horses on the meadows and let them run on the railway. Therefore, I suggest that the People's Governments in various places pay attention to this issue and educate the masses not to let livestock graze along railways.

    来信摘要
    应该允许使用简体字
    部队里正在展开大规模的文化学习运动。有的单位已经完成了速成识字教学，开始了正规的语文教学。我们在语文教学中发现一个问题，就是很多学员的作业里写了不少简体字，有些字还有几个不同的简写法。很多文化教员对简体字应否改正和应否有统一标准的问题，有不同的意见。希望你们转请有关机关研究。

    编者按：在教学过程中，应该允许学员写简体字。使用简体字的标准，应该是群众中应用最广泛的字。当简体字有几种不同写法时，文化教员应选择一个合理而通用的教给学员。
    沽源县结合传授技术大力推广新式农具
    察哈尔省沽源县在八月下旬举办了新农具训练班，参加的有各村干部、代表和劳动模范共二百多人。讲授班中着重地宣传了新式农具和组织起来的关系，并用实地试验的方式传授了使用和简单地修理七寸步犁的方法。经过这次教育后，广大农民争先恐后地预贷步犁，现全县共贷出九百五十四部。农民们说：“要是人民政府早把技术教给我们，我们早就使用新式步犁了。”大家都要求这批新农具能早日运到，以便秋耕时使用。

    农民迫切要求推广新接生法
    解放后在人民政府的提倡和帮助下，有些农村的旧接生婆经过短期的训练，学会了新法接生，效果很好，婴儿死亡率大大降低。但河北昌平县很多农村至今还是旧法接生，就拿东大兴庄来看，接生婆都没有学过新法接生，婴儿死亡率仍然很大。这不仅增加了妇女的痛苦和家庭的不幸，而且使群众中的某些封建迷信思想不能彻底消除。因此该村农民迫切希望人民政府能够把新接生法推广到该村去。
    我认为，这是广大农民的一个普遍要求。希望各地人民政府能够积极改造旧接生婆，训练她们学习新法接生，以满足农民的要求。

    应该教育群众不要在铁路沿线放牲口
    内蒙古自治区额尔古纳旗吉拉林的老乡为乌奴耳作业所运木材时，接连有马被火车撞死、撞伤。发生这种事情的原因，是他们在工作完毕后就把马放在草甸子上，随它们在铁路上跑。因此，我建议各地人民政府注意这个问题，教育群众不要在铁路沿线放牲口。
