Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 16th: The latest issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published an editorial entitled "On the Draft Amendment to the Party Constitution of the Lenin-Stalin Party," stating: Under the victorious banner of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, the Bolshevik Party has in the past and is still leading the Soviet people to struggle for the realization of the great communist construction plan, leading them from one victory to another. Because of the need to build a communist society in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union must undertake new and complex tasks, further consolidate the Party, and strengthen the Party organization's leading role in all economic and cultural construction sectors. Revising the Party Constitution is to achieve these lofty goals: to improve the combat effectiveness of Party organizations, to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of Party members, and to strengthen the vanguard role of Communist Party members. Every article of the draft amendment to the Party Constitution is imbued with this spirit. The editorial pointed out: The new Party Constitution embodies the organizational principles of Lenin-Stalin Bolshevism. On the one hand, the Bolshevik Party adheres to the inviolability of the principles themselves, and on the other hand, it has always adopted a creative Marxist viewpoint on organizational issues, just as it does on theoretical issues. This means that at different stages of the Party's development, organizational forms that are conducive to further improving the Party's work and ensuring the realization of the Party's political tasks are formulated based on the changed historical situation. The draft amendment to the Party Constitution summarizes the rich organizational experience accumulated by the Lenin-Stalin Party in the years since the 18th Congress, develops the basic organizational principles of Party building, and concretizes these principles according to new tasks. It makes the title of Communist Party member even more lofty, and the importance of Party members is further strengthened. The editorial elaborates on the lofty and important obligations that Party members should fulfill as stipulated in the draft amendment, as well as the broad rights of Party members. The editorial concludes: The draft amendment to the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is an event of great significance. It embodies the historic victories won by the Lenin-Stalin Party, the new tasks facing the Party in the period of gradual transition from socialism to communism, and the organizational methods for solving these tasks. The draft amendment to the Constitution of the CPSU has aroused great concern among Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries. This concern is completely understandable and not difficult to explain. Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries regard the Lenin-Stalin Party as a model party worthy of emulation and as the vanguard of the international communist movement. Communist Parties in various countries see in the Constitution of the Lenin-Stalin Party an example that they must constantly emulate in order to consolidate and further enhance their prestige as loyal and unwavering fighters for the interests of the people, and as the true leaders and organizers of the people's struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    论列宁—斯大林党关于党章的修正草案
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”社论摘要
    【新华社十六日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特讯：最近一期“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”以“论列宁—斯大林党关于党章的修正草案”为题发表社论说：在马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的胜利旗帜下，布尔什维克党过去曾经、现在还在领导苏联人民为实现伟大的共产主义建设计划而斗争，领导他们从一个胜利走到另一个胜利。由于要在苏联建设共产主义社会，苏联共产党必须承担新的复杂的任务、必须进一步巩固党和加强党组织在所有经济和文化建设部门中的领导作用。修改党章是为了达到下面这些崇高的目的：提高党组织的战斗效率、发挥广大党员的积极性和创造性、加强共产党员的先锋作用。党章修正草案的每一条都贯注着这种精神。社论指出：新党章中体现了列宁—斯大林布尔什维主义的组织原则。布尔什维克党一方面坚持原则本身之不可破坏，而另一方面，对于组织问题，正如对于理论问题一样，一直是采取创造性的马克思主义观点的，这就是在党的不同发展阶段，根据改变了的历史形势来规定那些有利于继续改进党的工作并保证党的政治任务之实现的组织形式。党章修正草案总结了列宁—斯大林党在第十八次代表大会以后这些年来所累积的丰富的组织经验，发展了党的建设的基本组织原则并根据新的任务把这些原则加以具体化。它使共产党员的称号更加崇高，党员的重要性进一步加强了。社论详细论述了修正草案中所规定的党员所应履行的崇高而重大的义务，以及党员的广泛权利。社论最后说：苏联共产党党章修正草案是一个具有重大意义的事件。它体现了列宁—斯大林党所获得的历史性胜利，体现了党在从社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的时期内所面临的新任务，体现了解决这些任务的组织方法。联共党章修正草案引起了各国共产党和工人党的极大的关心。这种关心是完全可以理解的，是不难解释的。各国共产党和工人党认为列宁—斯大林党是值得效法的模范党，是国际共产主义运动的先锋队。各国共产党在列宁—斯大林党的党章中看到了一个范例，它们必须不断取法这个崇高的范例，才能巩固并进一步提高它们作为为人民的利益而奋斗的忠贞不贰的战士、作为人民群众的争取和平、民主、社会主义的斗争的真正的领导者和组织者的威信。
