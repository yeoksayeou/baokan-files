	September 9th - The Great Festival of the Bulgarian People
	Lieutenant General Cherpiyeshev, Member of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party

	Eight years have passed since that day of great historical significance when freedom descended upon Bulgaria.

	On September 9, 1944, under the leadership of the working class and its fighting vanguard, the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Bulgarian people rose up in armed uprising, and with the decisive assistance of the fraternal Soviet Red Army, overthrew the regime of the fascist bourgeoisie. A people's democratic regime – one of the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat – was established in the country, paving the way for the construction of socialism.

	The Bulgarian people made great sacrifices in their heroic life-and-death struggle against Bulgarian fascism and European imperialism, and achieved the victory of September 9th. In this country, after the vicious coup d'état launched by Boris and the Tsankov fascist clique in collusion with Western imperialism on June 9, 1923, a fascist dictatorial regime was established. But the people did not lose courage. Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, headed by Georgi Dimitrov, the masses of the people rose up in resistance in September 1923. This was one of the earliest anti-fascist uprisings in the world, and they fought for the establishment of a government of workers and peasants.

	Due to a number of objective and subjective factors, the uprising failed. Savage fascist atrocities swept the country. But this did not help the bourgeois rulers. The Bulgarian people did not consider themselves defeated; they did not bow their heads. Despite suffering severe losses, the anti-fascist struggle gained new momentum, attracting more and more brave and selfless men and women to join the struggle. After the fascist government openly sided with the Nazi aggressors and allowed the Hitler bandits to occupy the country, the struggle became even more fierce. The Bulgarian Communist Party, headed by Georgi Dimitrov, the mentor and leader of the Bulgarian people, led this great struggle.

	Georgi Dimitrov, drawing on the experience of the international workers' movement and the anti-fascist struggle of communist parties in various countries, specifically pointed out that for Bulgaria, the Fatherland Front was the most appropriate form of organization for uniting domestic democratic forces to oppose the German occupiers and their Bulgarian lackeys. The workers, laboring peasants, progressive intellectuals, and patriotic officers and soldiers of Bulgaria responded without hesitation to Dimitrov's call and formed ranks under the fighting banner of the Fatherland Front.

	The mountains in the country were filled with guerrilla units. The song of the revolutionary poet Botev, "Those who fall in the battlefield for freedom do not die..." resounded through the valleys. The guerrilla forces developed into the People's Liberation Army, with its own headquarters and theater staffs. Armed assault teams were organized in cities and villages. Revolutionary committees were also established in the national fascist army. Revolutionary trade unions launched economic sabotage operations in military production and transportation sectors. Fatherland Front revolutionary committees were established throughout the country. The fascist government felt as if it were sitting on an erupting volcano. Therefore, despite pressure from Hitler, the Bulgarian bourgeoisie did not dare to send Bulgarian troops to fight against the Soviet Union; when reinforcements were urgently needed on the Eastern Front, Bulgarian troops remained in the Balkans to guard the rear.

	"This period of resistance will be written in gold in the history of our Party and our people, and our Party and our people will be proud to have tens of thousands of guerrillas and heroic men and women who are flesh and blood with them, who were organized by the Party to carry out armed struggle against the German occupiers and Bulgarian fascists" (Georgi Dimitrov).

	After the Iasi-Kishinev operation and the surrender of the Romanian fascist regime on August 23, the conditions for an armed people's uprising in Bulgaria matured.

	On August 26, 1944, the Central Committee of the Party issued the historic Fourth Proclamation, calling on all organizations, leading bodies, and members of the Party, pointing out that their current task and that of the Bulgarian people was to overthrow the fascist regency council and government through armed uprising and establish a Fatherland Front government.

	On the same day, the General Headquarters of the People's Revolutionary Army ordered an attack throughout the country to win the establishment of local Fatherland Front regimes.

	On September 2, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party decided to call on the country to hold a political general strike and armed demonstrations on September 6 as the starting point for an armed uprising to seize power.

	On September 5, the Soviet government formally declared war on the Bulgarian fascist government. This created favorable conditions for the strike on September 6. Revolutionary action spread throughout the country. In some cities and villages, armed organizations took over state organs, opened prisons, and freed prisoners. Economic life came to a standstill, and the fascist regime was paralyzed and completely disintegrated. The bourgeoisie was in complete chaos. On September 8, Soviet troops entered the country. They were warmly welcomed by the Bulgarian people as never before.

	"In this 'war' not a single shot was fired, not a single Soviet or Bulgarian soldier was sacrificed; and the arrival of the Soviet army in Bulgaria helped to overthrow the fascist dictatorship and guaranteed the future of the Bulgarian people and the freedom and independence of our country" (Georgi Dimitrov).

	As planned, the people seized power at three o'clock in the morning on September 9, and a Fatherland Front government led by the Communist Party was established.

	The primary task of the People's Government was to mobilize the strength of the Bulgarian people to participate in the war against Nazi Germany. "Everything for the front, everything for victory!" was the Party's most important slogan after September 9th. In the battles to liberate Yugoslavia and Hungary, the Bulgarian People's Army suffered 32,000 casualties.

	After the end of the war, under the leadership of Georgi Dimitrov, work began on building a new people's democratic state of workers and peasants. Autocracy was abolished. The entire state apparatus – both central and local – was reorganized. Industry, banks, and mines were nationalized, and land reform and nationalization of large agricultural machinery were implemented. This limited the economic foothold of the bourgeoisie in large cities and villages and created favorable conditions for building a socialist planned economy. All these achievements are the concrete realization of the Dimitrov Constitution.

	A two-year economic recovery plan began to be implemented, and this plan was completed in one year and nine months. This was followed by the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, which laid the foundation for the establishment of socialism. Socialist construction projects for heavy industry, dams, and railways began. At the same time, efforts were made to transform agriculture, establish machine tractor stations and cooperative farms, develop the country's natural resources, and electrify the countryside.

	The achievements of our people aroused the strong jealousy of US-British imperialism. They realized that they had lost their position in Bulgaria, and brazenly attempted to interfere in our country's internal affairs and plot subversive activities against the People's Government. But their tools hidden under the guise of political opposition, such as Petkov and Velchev, were completely crushed. The traitorous group of Kostov – a large conspiracy group – was also smashed.

	Our country has received enormous and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union and cooperation with the people's democratic countries, learned a great deal of experience, followed the instructions of Georgi Dimitrov, and under the wise leadership of Comrade Chervenkov, is steadily advancing in all aspects.

	Our industrial production is growing rapidly. The production volume in 1951 was four times that of 1939. This year, it will exceed the 16.4 percent of industrial production stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1953. In many important industrial sectors, the Five-Year Plan will be completed in four years.

	The total amount of construction investment increases every year. The investment in 1951 was twice that of 1948. Many enterprises are equipped with the latest machines, such as the "Stalin," "Republic," and "Chervenkov" thermal power plants, the "Vichima" hydroelectric power station, asbestos cement factories, two automatic repair shops, strong current and weak current electrical equipment factories, wire factories, electrical porcelain factories, the largest textile factory in the Balkans, the "Telman" textile factory, the "Stalin" large chemical factory and many other factories, all of which were put into operation in 1949.

	There have also been great achievements in agriculture. The Five-Year Plan's production targets for wheat, corn, cotton, sunflower, beet, tobacco, and other agricultural products will be completed in less than four years.

	Agricultural mechanization and collectivization are being implemented at a rapid pace. Two-thirds of the public grain is supplied by the socialist sector of agriculture. The rich peasants have been restricted from developing. They have lost their political and economic importance and will soon become a thing of the past. Cooperative farms have taken a dominant position.

	Due to the adoption of socialist methods of production, new people – socialist labor heroes – have emerged throughout the country.

	Production competitions and the Stakhanov movement are booming. Thousands of male and female workers have won Dimitrov bonuses, as well as certificates and medals. Labor productivity is rising, and production costs are falling. National income is constantly growing. The quality of products is improving, and many new types of goods are being provided. Prices are falling, and welfare to meet the cultural needs of the working people is being improved daily. In cities and villages, housing, schools and theaters, health centers, nurseries and sanatoriums, as well as children's parks and playgrounds are being built in large numbers. New cities are rising, nature is being transformed, and the people are changing as well.

	All these achievements have been made possible because of the victory of September 9, 1944. September 9th is the great National Day of the Bulgarian people. On this day, we will look back at the achievements made in the past year and mobilize the strength of the country to advance along the road pointed out by Georgi Dimitrov. These achievements are possible first and foremost thanks to the enormous and selfless assistance given to us by the fraternal Soviet Union and Stalin himself. Therefore, friendship with the Soviet Union is as important to our people as "sunshine and air are to life" (Georgi Dimitrov).

	The Bulgarian people, celebrating the eighth anniversary of September 9, 1944, will unite with firm confidence around the Bulgarian Communist Party, firmly believing that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party headed by Comrade Chervenkov, despite the frantic clamoring of US-British imperialism and their Balkan lackeys, we will follow Dimitrov's correct path towards peace and socialism.

    九月九日——保加利亚人民的伟大节日
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会委员  保加利亚陆军中将  切尔皮也舍夫
    自从自由降临保加利亚的那个具有伟大历史意义的日子到现在，已经过去八年了。
    一九四四年九月九日，保加利亚人民在工人阶级和它的战斗先锋队保加利亚共产党的领导下，奋起举行武装起义，得到亲如兄弟的苏联红军决定性的帮助，推翻了法西斯大资产阶级的政权。人民民主政权——无产阶级专政形式之一——在国内建立起来，铺平了建设社会主义的道路。
    保加利亚人民在反对保加利亚法西斯主义和欧洲帝国主义的英勇的生死斗争中作了伟大的牺牲，取得了九月九日的胜利。在这个国家中，自从一九二三年六月九日鲍利斯和昌可夫法西斯党羽与西方帝国主义同谋发动的恶毒政变之后，法西斯的独裁政权便建立起来。但是人民并没有丧失勇气。人民群众在以乔治·季米特洛夫为首的保加利亚共产党领导下，于一九二三年九月便起来反抗。这是世界上最早的一次反法西斯起义，他们为争取建立工农政权而战斗。
    由于一些客观的和主观的因素，起义失败了。野蛮的法西斯暴行遍及全国。但是这并无助于资产阶级统治者。保加利亚人民没有认为自己已经失败；他们并不低头。虽然遭受了严重的损失，反法西斯斗争却获得新的动力，吸引了愈来愈多的勇敢无私的男女战士参加到斗争里来。在法西斯政府公开投向纳粹侵略者一边并允许希特勒匪帮占领国土以后，斗争便更加猛烈起来了。以保加利亚人民导师和领袖乔治·季米特洛夫为首的保加利亚共产党，领导着这一伟大的斗争。
    乔治·季米特洛夫吸取了国际工人运动和各国共产党反法西斯斗争的经验，具体地指出：对于保加利亚，祖国阵线是团结国内民主力量进行反对德国占领者及其保加利亚走狗最适当的组织形式。保加利亚的工人、劳动农民和进步知识分子、爱国官兵，毫无犹豫地响应季米特洛夫的号召，在祖国阵线的战斗旗帜下组成了队伍。
    国内山地中布满了游击队。革命诗人保捷夫的名歌“在为自由而战的战场上倒下的人并没有死……”的歌声响彻山谷。游击队的部队发展成为有它自己的司令部和战区参谋部的人民解放军。武装突击队在城市和乡村中组织起来。在全国法西斯军队中也成立了革命委员会。革命工会在军事生产和运输部门发动破坏经济的行动。祖国阵线革命委员会在全国各地成立。法西斯政府感到有如坐在一个爆发的火山之上。因此，虽然希特勒曾施以压力，保加利亚的资产阶级也不敢派保加利亚军队去和苏联作战；当东线亟需援军的时候，保加利亚军队仍然留在巴尔干守卫后方。
    “抵抗运动这一段时期，将以金字写在我们党和我们人民的历史上，我们的党和我们的人民将以拥有好几万的游击队员和与他们血肉相连的英雄男女而自豪，党把他们组织起来进行反对德国占领者和保加利亚法西斯分子的武装斗争”（乔治·季米特洛夫）。
    雅西—基西尼夫战役以及罗马尼亚法西斯政权于八月二十三日投降以后，在保加利亚进行武装人民起义的条件便告成熟了。
    一九四四年八月二十六日，党中央委员会发出历史性的第四号通告，向党的一切组织、领导团体和党员发出号召，指出他们和保加利亚人民当前的任务，就是以武装起义推翻法西斯的摄政会议和政府，建立祖国阵线政府。
    同日，人民革命军总司令部下令在全国发动攻击，以争取建立地方的祖国阵线政权。
    九月二日，保加利亚共产党中央委员会决定号召全国在九月六日举行政治性总罢工和武装示威，作为夺取政权的武装起义的起点。
    九月五日，苏联政府正式向保加利亚法西斯政府宣战。这给九月六日的罢工创造了有利的情势。革命行动扩展到全国各处。在一些城市和乡村中，武装组织接管了国家机关，打开了监狱，使犯人得到了自由。经济生活陷于停顿，法西斯政权陷于瘫痪并全部瓦解。资产阶级内部一团混乱。九月八日苏军开进国境。他们受到保加利亚人民空前未有的热烈欢迎。
    “在这个‘战争’中没有放过一枪，没有一个苏联或者保加利亚的士兵牺牲；而苏军的到达保加利亚却帮助了推翻法西斯独裁，以及保证了保加利亚人民的将来和我国的自由和独立”（乔治·季米特洛夫）。
    按照预订的计划，人民在九月九日上午三点钟掌握了政权，成立了由共产党担任领导地位的祖国阵线政府。
    人民政府的首要任务是动员保加利亚人民的力量参加反对纳粹德国的战争。“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利！”是党在九月九日以后最重要的口号。在解放南斯拉夫和匈牙利的战斗中，保加利亚人民军伤亡了三万二千人。
    战争结束之后，在乔治·季米特洛夫领导下，开始了建设工人和农民的新的人民民主国家的工作。专制被废除了。整个国家机构——中央的和地方的——都进行了整顿。工业、银行和矿山收归国有，实行土地改革和大型的农业机器的国有化。这就限制了大城市和乡村资产阶级的经济立脚点，给建设社会主义的计划经济创造了有利条件。所有这些成就都是季米特洛夫宪法的具体实现。
    两年经济恢复计划开始实行，这个计划在一年零九个月内便完成了。跟着就实行奠定建立社会主义基础的第一个五年计划。重工业、水闸和铁路的社会主义建设工程开始了。同时着手改造农业，建立机器拖拉机站和合作农场，开发国家的自然资源和实行乡村电气化。
    我国人民的成就引起了美英帝国主义的强烈嫉恨。他们明白他们已丧失了在保加利亚的地位，便悍然企图干涉我国的内政，并且策划反对人民政府的颠覆活动。但是他们隐藏在政治反对派伪装下的工具如彼得科夫、维尔切夫之流被彻底击溃。科斯托夫的卖国集团——一个大阴谋集团也被粉碎了。
    我们的国家获得了苏联的巨大与无私的援助以及和人民民主国家的合作，学习了大量的经验，遵从乔治·季米特洛夫的训谕，在契尔文科夫同志的英明领导下，在各方面稳步前进。
    我们的工业生产迅速增长。一九五一年的生产量相当于一九三九年的四倍。今年将超过五年计划中规定一九五三年工业生产的百分之十六点四。在许多重要的工业部门，五年计划将在四年内完成。
    建设投资的总额每年增加。一九五一年的投资额便两倍于一九四八年。许多企业都装置了最新式的机器，像“斯大林”、“共和国”和“契尔文科夫”等热力发电站，“维其马”水电站，石绵水泥工厂，两个自动修理厂，强流和弱流电气设备工厂，电线工厂，电业用瓷工厂，在巴尔干最大的纺织厂“台尔曼”纺织厂，“斯大林”大化学工厂和许多其他的工厂，在一九四九年便都已开工了。
    在农业方面也有伟大的成就。五年计划关于小麦、玉蜀黍、棉花、向日葵、甜菜、烟草和其他农产品的生产量，不到四年便将完成。
    农业机械化和集体化以很快的速度在实行着。公粮有三分之二是由农业的社会主义部分所供应的。富农已被限制发展。他们已失去了在政治上和经济上的重要性，快将变成历史上的陈迹了。合作农场已经占着优势。
    由于采取社会主义的生产方式，新的人民—社会主义劳动英雄在全国涌现出来。
    生产竞赛和斯达哈诺夫运动蓬勃开展。好几千男女工人荣获季米特洛夫奖金以及奖状和奖章。劳动生产率上升，生产成本下降。国民收入不断增长。生产品的质量在改进，而且提供许多新种类的物品。物价在降低，为满足劳动人民文化需求的福利日益改进。在城市和乡村中，住宅、学校和戏院，保健中心、托儿所和休养站，以及儿童公园和娱乐场大批地建设起来。新的城市崛起，自然被改造，人民也改变了。
    所有这些成就都是因为有了一九四四年九月九日的胜利才能够得到的。九月九日这一天是保加利亚人民伟大的国庆日，在这一天我们将回顾过去一年所取得的成绩，并动员全国的力量循着乔治·季米特洛夫所指出的道路前进。这些成就之所以成为可能，首先应该感谢亲如兄弟的苏联和斯大林本人所给予我们的巨大与无私的帮助。因此，与苏联的友好对于我国人民，其重要性有如“阳光空气对生命一样”（乔治·季米特洛夫）。
    保加利亚人民庆祝一九四四年九月九日的八周年，将满怀着坚定的信心团结在保加利亚共产党的周围，坚信在以契尔文科夫同志为首的保加利亚共产党中央委员会的领导之下，尽管美英帝国主义和他们的巴尔干走狗疯狂叫嚣，我们将循着季米特洛夫的正确道路走向和平与社会主义。
