U.S. Economic Aggression Against Asia and the Pacific Region

The Asian and Pacific region has always occupied an important position in the US expansion plans. Long before the First World War, the tentacles of US monopoly capital had actively extended to various countries in the region. As a result of the Second World War, major changes took place within the imperialist camp. Japan, Germany, and Italy collapsed, and countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands were weakened. The United States became the most important power in the imperialist camp, and the US ruling group attempted to dominate the world, intensifying its economic, political, and military expansion in the Asia-Pacific region as part of its plan to establish world hegemony. In the post-war years, US monopoly capitalists have been engaged in insatiable plunder in this vast region of Asia and the Pacific, rich in resources and with a large population.

Investment and Monopoly

Exporting capital and monopolizing markets are the main means by which US monopoly capital seizes wealth and strategic materials for new wars. After the end of the Second World War, US monopoly capitalists actively engaged in economic expansion into Asia. They first turned defeated Japan into a tool for plundering the Far East. In 1946, US monopoly capitalists used a series of occupation decrees to crack down on Japanese Zaibatsu, acquiring shares of major Japanese companies at low prices and controlling 20 to 50 percent of the shares of more than a dozen large companies. Moreover, US investment in Japan has increased year by year, now reaching $1 billion, about five times the pre-war level. In this way, US monopoly capital has gradually gained control over Japanese industry. At the same time, the United States monopolized Japan's foreign trade through its occupation. From the end of the Second World War to 1950, the United States accounted for more than 2.2 billion US dollars of Japan's total import of more than 3.3 billion US dollars. In 1951-1952, the United States imported 60 percent of Japan's 2.2 million tons of coal and 1.5 million tons of salt. US monopoly capitalists transport their surplus raw materials to Japan at high prices, using Japan's industrial equipment and cheap labor to process them into industrial products, which are dumped in other regions to extract high profits.

In order to promote its economic plundering policy, US capital massively invaded Southeast Asia and other Asian countries after the Second World War, seizing part of the capital positions of Britain, France, and the Netherlands. In 1949, the US "Industrial Week" revealed that the United States planned to export $10 billion of capital to Southeast Asia in ten to fifteen years. Now US monopoly capital occupies an important position in Southeast Asian countries. In Indonesia, US capital accounts for $1 billion of the $2.5 billion in foreign investment. US monopoly capitalists control most of the shares of many large oil and rubber companies in Indonesia. The newly established "Pacific Petroleum Company," whose entire capital belongs to the US "Texaco Oil Company" and "Mobil Oil Company," has obtained the mining rights for more than 380,000 hectares of oil fields in the Riau Islands; the largest rubber plantation in Sumatra is also controlled by the three major US rubber companies. In May 1949, the United States also signed a secret agreement with the Indonesian government, stipulating that the United States would invest $1 billion in Indonesia's oil and rubber industries within five years. In the Philippines, important resources such as sugar, hemp, coconut, and tobacco are controlled by US capital, and oil, gold, copper, manganese, and other minerals are also monopolized by US capital. In Thailand, US monopoly capitalists have obtained the mining rights for tin mines and are constantly strengthening their control over the timber and leather industries. The "Thai-American Forest Company," jointly established by the United States and Thailand, with 49 percent of US capital, will monopolize Thailand's forestry industry. US investment in India is also increasing, now reaching $240 million, and will soon increase to $400 million. US monopoly capital is actively seizing the mining rights for India's important strategic raw material, manganese ore.

Across the Pacific, in Latin American countries, US investment has increased even more rapidly, reaching $6 billion by 1950, accounting for about 50 percent of the total US direct foreign investment. The massive influx of capital has enabled the United States to control Venezuela and other countries' oil resources, Chile's copper and nitrate, Bolivia and Brazil's tin and manganese, Colombia's rare metal mines, Cuba and Costa Rica's orchards, and other natural resources. Venezuela, the second largest oil producer in the capitalist world, has 70 percent of its oil production controlled by US capital; in Guatemala, US capital owns 75 percent of the arable land.

The US's full efforts to seize strategic raw material resources in Asia and the Pacific region are inseparable from the US's plan to prepare for new wars of aggression. The United States uses its control over the export trade of various countries to transport large quantities of strategic materials. In Asia, for example, in the French-occupied area of Vietnam, more than 20,000 tons of rubber were exported in the first four months of 1950, of which the United States accounted for more than 14,000 tons. In 1949, Malaya shipped 43,900 tons of tin to the United States, accounting for 80 percent of Malaya's total tin exports. Thailand exported 110,000 metric tons of rubber in 1951, of which 100,300 metric tons were shipped to the United States. 71 percent of Indonesia's total bauxite production is shipped to the United States. 95 percent of the Philippines' export trade is transacted with the United States. In 1950, Latin American countries' exports to the United States accounted for one-third of the total US imports, and raw materials accounted for 60 to 99 percent of the exports of various countries. This trade is not conducted on an equal and mutually beneficial basis. US monopoly capitalists often use various means to exert pressure on raw material supplying countries, forcing them to export raw materials at low prices.

US capital also monopolizes the import trade of Asian countries, dumping large quantities of surplus industrial products and grain in Asian countries. In 1951, the total US exports to the Far East exceeded 3.9 times the pre-war level in 1937. From 1946 to 1948, US export trade to the Philippines accounted for 82.6 percent of the total Philippine imports. In 1948, 60 percent of the cotton fabrics imported by Indonesia were supplied from the United States and Japan. In the same year, US fabrics shipped to Malaya accounted for 49.4 percent of the total Malayan imports. In 1951, US exports to India also increased by two times, ranking first in India's imports. Latin American countries are even more regarded by the United States as markets for dumping surplus goods. The United States accounts for three-fifths of the total imports of Latin America. Central and South American countries are famous for producing sugar and fruits, but the US's inferior beverages and canned foods flood the markets of various countries; a large number of consumer goods, from leather shoes to straw hats, pour into various countries like a tide; the machinery required for industrial production is minimal in the imports. This is clearly a vicious policy to increasingly colonize Latin America, and the United States is adopting the same means to carry out ruthless plunder in Asian countries.

"Aid" and "Embargo"

In order to step up its expansion activities in various colonies and backward countries, Truman announced the so-called "Point Four Program" in January 1949. Since then, the United States has used the guise of "aid to backward regions" to coerce Asian and Pacific countries to sign "agreements" that seriously damage the sovereignty of various countries, obtaining the privilege to develop resources and monopolize markets in these countries. For example, the "US-Thai Economic and Technical Agreement" signed with Thailand in 1950 stipulates that Thailand should "remove obstacles to international trade" so that Americans can freely purchase materials and dump goods in Thailand, and allow Americans to arbitrarily plunder Thai raw materials. The "US-Burma Economic Cooperation Bilateral Agreement," signed at almost the same time, allowed the United States to obtain the privilege to mine oil and other non-metallic minerals in Burma. The Quirino government of the Philippines had earlier signed the so-called "US-Philippine Trade Agreement" with the United States, granting Americans the right to develop resources in any region of the Philippines, and stipulating that the Philippines shall not tax exports to the United States, and US goods shall be imported into the Philippines duty-free for the first eight years after the war. Even the Philippine National Economic Council cannot but admit that this agreement, which infringes upon sovereignty, "is something that no truly independent country can agree to with a foreign country." Through various bilateral agreements, the United States not only obtains economic privileges in various countries but also obtains military control, such as unrestricted control over the armed forces of Thailand and the ability to build airports in Burma. It can be seen that the US's economic expansion activities are closely linked to its military aggression plans. US monopoly capitalists are not only engaged in frantic plunder at home and abroad but are also actively preparing for new wars of aggression that they believe can reap more wealth.

After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it forced various countries to implement an "embargo" against China and strengthened the "blockade" against the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, in an attempt to further monopolize the world's raw material and commodity markets and extract higher profits. At the same time, this is also a component of the US plan to prepare for a world war of aggression. Under the pretext of "preventing communist aggression," the United States prevents various countries from trading with China, the Soviet Union, and various people's democratic countries in order to create difficulties for certain countries in importing raw materials, grain, and light industrial products, and takes the opportunity to strengthen its control over them; on the other hand, it makes many other countries lose vast markets for selling industrial equipment, industrial raw materials, industrial products, and agricultural products, and takes advantage of their difficulties to arbitrarily lower prices and profit from them. For example, Japan could have bought large quantities of cheap raw materials such as coal, iron, and soybeans from China, but it was forced to import them from the United States or other dollar areas at high prices. Japan only needs to pay $17 per ton to buy coal from China, but now it has to pay $28 or $29 to import US coal. For example, rubber and tin from Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaya, and Thailand have plummeted in price because they are prohibited from being sold to China. The price of Indonesian rubber is now about three times lower than before the "embargo," and Ceylon's rubber is almost entirely controlled by the United States after the "embargo." The United States can arbitrarily decide the quantity of Ceylon's rubber to be purchased and control the price of rubber.

Creating Backwardness and Poverty

The expansionist policy of the United States seriously damages the economies of various countries in Asia and the Pacific region. Because US monopoly capitalists greedily plunder resources and dump goods in various countries, the industries and agriculture of various countries are severely devastated. Latin American countries have become appendages that supply raw materials and sell industrial products for the United States. They can only rely on exporting one or several products to the United States to maintain their national economies. Heavy industry has no way to develop, and even light industry and agriculture are severely devastated. For example, in order to promote the sale of automobiles in Colombia, the United States has tried its best to sabotage the country's plan to build railways. Because most of Cuba's arable land is used to produce raw materials for the United States and cannot grow rice, it produces less than a quarter of its required rice each year, so it has to import a large amount of grain from the United States. Asian countries are also suffering the same fate. For example, the Philippines, known for its cigars, is forced to import $24 million worth of US cigarettes every year. The United States dumps US and Japanese textiles in Indonesia, causing a large number of Indonesian textile factories to close down and reduce production. Because of the massive import of US grain, the area of rice fields in Japan has shrunk by 24 percent. In order to maintain high profits and at the same time crack down on its rival Britain, the United States vigorously encourages Japanese industrial products to be dumped in Southeast Asia, but as a result, Japan has a surplus in trade with the sterling area, creating a sterling surplus crisis (because Britain has to transport raw materials from the sterling area to the United States to exchange for US dollars, and Japan cannot exchange this huge amount of sterling foreign exchange for the raw materials it needs). The Japanese government can only take measures to restrict exports to save this crisis, which greatly hits Japan's export trade. Due to sluggish sales, Japan's accumulated steel products by the end of March this year, ordinary steel alone amounted to more than 600,000 tons; textile factories across the country were forced to reduce production by 40 percent, and many textile factories went bankrupt; other rayon, rubber industries, etc. were also forced to cut production.

The US "blockade" and "embargo" policies have further aggravated the damage to the economies of various countries. Because they are forced to sever normal trade relations with China, the Soviet Union, and other countries, countries in the Asia-Pacific region must rely more on the United States and fall into a serious economic crisis. For example, because Japan cannot buy cheap industrial raw materials from China and needs to import them from the United States at high prices, the cost of industrial products increases, and the prices are high, making it impossible to compete in the international market, which greatly affects industry and commerce. For example, the price of Indonesian rubber has plummeted because it has lost its Chinese customers, and the United States deliberately suppresses prices by suspending purchases, forcing Indonesia's rubber production to be greatly reduced. Last year, the output of private rubber was 94,000 tons less than the previous year, and rubber factories closed down one after another, endangering the entire Indonesian economic life. According to official British figures, Malaya's rubber exports in January this year decreased by more than 21,000 tons compared with December last year, and 6,000 workers in Singapore lost their jobs. These are all evil consequences caused by the US's forced implementation of "embargo" and "blockade."

The economic aggression of the United States has brought extremely deep disasters to the people of various countries in Asia and the Pacific region. Under the exploitation of the United States, the lives of people in Latin American countries are deteriorating. According to official statistics, two-thirds of the people are often undernourished; the annual income of each person in Southeast Asian countries is only 30 to 60 US dollars, and in some areas, the amount of food consumed per person has not even returned to pre-war levels; the number of unemployed and semi-employed people in Japan reaches more than 18 million.

The people of various countries are increasingly strongly opposed to the expansionist policy of the United States. Businessmen in various countries are trying to get rid of the shackles imposed on them by the United States, and the governments of various countries are also uneasy because the expansion of the United States has caused serious economic crises in their countries. The opposition of the people of Latin American countries to signing so-called "bilateral agreements" with the United States has thwarted the US's conspiracy to further carry out economic and military aggression. The people of Asian countries are also increasingly seeing the ferocious face of the US in plundering and preparing for war. At the international trade conference held in Singapore last October, representatives from India and Ceylon called for improved trade relations. Indonesian Prime Minister Wilopo recently publicly accused the US "embargo" measures as a policy that discriminates against and violates the national interests of Asian countries. Ceylon, regardless of US threats, hopes to trade with China. Japanese national industrialists unanimously demanded to develop trade with China and signed an agreement to exchange goods with China. These facts powerfully illustrate that the people of Asian and Pacific countries cannot tolerate US control and restrictions on them, and actively demand the establishment of equal, mutually beneficial, and cooperative international trade relations between countries, and oppose the US's economic aggression and conspiracy to prepare for war.

    美国对亚洲及太平洋区域的经济侵略
    亚洲及太平洋区域，一向在美国的扩张计划中占着重要的地位。远在第一次世界大战以前，美国垄断资本的触角就已向这个地区的各国积极伸展。第二次世界大战的结果，帝国主义阵营内部起了重大的变化，日、德、意三国崩溃了，英、法、荷兰等国削弱了，美国成为帝国主义阵营中最主要的强国，美国的统治集团便妄图独霸世界，而把加紧对亚洲及太平洋区域的经济、政治和军事扩张作为它建立世界霸权的计划的一部分。在战后的年代里，美国垄断资本家在亚洲及太平洋区域这一个资源富庶、人口众多的广大地区中，进行着贪得无厌的掠夺。
    投资和垄断
    输出资本和垄断市场，是美国垄断资本掠取财富和用以准备新战争的战略物资的主要手段。第二次世界大战结束后，美国垄断资本家便积极向亚洲进行经济扩张活动。他们首先把战败了的日本变为它掠夺远东的工具。一九四六年的时候，美国垄断资本家就利用一连串占领法令打击日本的财阀，廉价取得日本各大企业的股票，操纵了十多个大公司百分之二十到五十的股份。而且美国在日本的投资逐年增加，现在已达到十亿美元，约等于战前的五倍。这样，美国垄断资本便逐渐获得对日本工业的控制权。同时美国并通过对日本的占领，垄断了日本的对外贸易。第二次世界大战结束后到一九五○年日本全部输入总额三十三亿余美元中，美国就占了二十二亿余美元。一九五一—一九五二年日本进口的二百二十万吨煤和一百五十万吨盐中，就有百分之六十是由美国输入的。美国垄断资本家将自己剩余的原料高价运销日本，利用日本的工业设备和廉价劳动力加工制成工业品，向其他地区倾销，而从中榨取高额的利润。
    为了推行经济掠夺政策，美国资本在第二次世界大战后大规模侵入东南亚及亚洲其他国家，夺取英、法、荷等国的一部分资本阵地。在一九四九年，美国的“实业周报”就透露过：美国打算在十年到十五年内输往东南亚一百亿美元的资本。现在美国垄断资本在东南亚各国已占着重要的地位。在印度尼西亚，二十五亿美元外国投资中就有十亿美元是美国资本。美国垄断资本家掌握了印尼许多大石油公司和大橡胶公司的大部分股份。新成立不久的“太平洋石油公司”，全部资本都是属于美国“德士古煤油公司”和“美孚油公司”的，这个公司取得了廖内群岛三十八万多公顷油田的开采权；苏门答腊最大的橡胶园也是被控制在美国三大橡胶公司的手中。一九四九年五月，美国并和印尼政府签订了密约，规定美国在五年内投资十亿美元于印尼的石油和橡胶工业。在菲律宾，重要的资源如糖、麻、椰子、烟草等都被美国资本所控制，石油和金、铜、锰等矿砂亦被美国资本所垄断。在泰国，美国垄断资本家取得了锡矿的开采权，同时不断加强对木材和皮革业的控制。美泰合组的“泰美森林有限公司”，其中有百分之四十九的美国资本，这个公司将垄断泰国的森林业。美国在印度的投资也不断增加，现在已达到二亿四千万美元，最近将增至四亿美元。美国垄断资本正在积极攫取印度重要战略原料锰矿的开采权。
    在太平洋彼岸拉丁美洲国家，美国的投资额更是迅速增加，到一九五○年已达到六十亿美元，约占美国对外直接投资总额的百分之五十。大量资本的侵入，使美国控制了委内瑞拉和其他国家的石油资源、智利的铜矿和硝石、玻利维亚和巴西的锡矿和锰矿、哥伦比亚的稀有金属矿、古巴和哥斯达黎加的水果园以及其他天然资源。石油产量在资本主义世界中居第二位的委内瑞拉，百分之七十的石油生产被美国资本所控制；在危地马拉，美国资本拥有百分之七十五的耕地。
    美国全力夺取亚洲及太平洋区域的战略原料资源，是与美国准备新侵略战争计划分不开的。美国利用对各国出口贸易的控制，把各种战略物资大量运走。在亚洲，如越南法占区一九五○年头四个月输出橡胶二万多吨，美国就占了一万四千多吨。一九四九年马来亚输往美国的锡达四万三千九百吨，占马来亚锡的输出总额百分之八十。泰国一九五一年输出十一万公吨橡胶，输往美国的就占了十万零三百公吨。印尼铁矾土全部产量百分之七十一都输往美国。菲律宾的出口贸易中，有百分之九十五是与美国交易的。拉丁美洲各国一九五○年向美国的输出占了美国输入总额三分之一，各国的输出品中有百分之六十到九十九是原料。而这种贸易并不是在平等互利的基础上进行的，美国垄断资本家经常用各种手段向原料供应国施以压力，强迫它们以低价输出原料。
    美国资本同样也垄断着亚洲各国的进口贸易，把大量过剩的工业品和粮食倾销亚洲各国。一九五一年美国对远东的输出总额就超过了战前一九三七年的三点九倍。一九四六至四八年美国对菲律宾的出口贸易占了菲律宾输入总额百分之八十二点六。一九四八年印尼输入的棉织品有百分之六十是从美国和日本供应的。同年美国输往马来亚的布匹占了马来亚输入总额百分之四十九点四。一九五一年美国对印度的输出额也增大了二倍，在印度的输入中占第一位。拉丁美洲各国更是被美国看作倾销过剩商品的市场，在拉丁美洲的输入总额中，美国占了五分之三的比重。中南美各国是以产糖和水果出名的，但是美国的劣质饮料和罐头食品却充斥各国市场；大量消费品，从皮鞋到草帽，像潮水一般涌入各国；输入品中，工业生产需用的机器则微乎其微。这显然是使拉丁美洲日益殖民地化的恶毒政策，而美国正采用同样的手段向亚洲各国进行无情的掠夺。
    “援助”与“禁运”
    为了加紧对各殖民地及落后国家的扩张活动，杜鲁门于一九四九年一月宣布了所谓“第四点计划”。从那个时候起，美国便利用“援助落后地区”为幌子，胁迫亚洲及太平洋区域各国分别签订了严重损害各国主权的“协定”，取得在这些国家开发资源和垄断市场的特权。如一九五○年与泰国签订的“美泰经济技术协定”，里面就规定泰国应“清除有关国际贸易上的障碍”，使美国人可以在泰国自由采购物资和倾销商品，并允许美国人任意掠取泰国的原料。在差不多同时签订的“美缅经济合作双边协定”，使美国取得了在缅甸开采油矿和其他非金属矿藏的特权。菲律宾的季里诺政府则更早就已与美国签订了所谓“美菲贸易协定”，给予美国人在菲律宾任何地区开发资源的权利，并规定菲律宾不得对输往美国的出口物品征税，在战后头八年美货免税输入菲律宾，这种侵害主权的协定，连菲律宾的全国经济委员会也不能不承认，“是任何真正独立的国家都不能答应外国的事情。”通过各种双边协定，美国不仅在各国取得经济上的特权，同时获得军事上的控制权力，如对泰国的武装部队握有无限制的控制权，在缅甸可以修筑飞机场等。可以看出，美国的经济扩张活动，是与它的军事侵略计划密切联系着的。美国的垄断资本家不仅在国内外疯狂地进行掠夺，并且积极准备着他们认为可以从中猎取更多财富的新侵略战争。
    美国发动侵朝战争后，又强迫各国对中国实行“禁运”，并加强对苏联和各人民民主国家的“封锁”，企图达到进一步垄断世界原料与商品市场，榨取更高利润的目的。同时，这也是美国准备世界性侵略战争计划的一个组成部分。美国以“防止共产主义侵略”为藉口，阻止各国与中、苏和各人民民主国家进行贸易，以造成某些国家输入原料、粮食和轻工业品的困难，而乘机加强对他们的控制；另一方面又使另外许多国家失掉销售工业器材、工业原料、工业制品和农产品的广大市场，而利用他们的困难，肆意压价收购，从中牟利。例如日本本来可以从中国廉价买到大量煤、铁和大豆等原料，却被迫以高价从美国或其他美元地区输入。日本从中国买煤每吨只需付十七美元，现在则要付二十八、九美元输入美煤。又例如印尼、马来亚和泰国等东南亚国家的橡胶和锡，因为被禁止运销中国，价格暴跌。印尼的橡胶现在较“禁运”前落价约三倍，锡兰的橡胶在“禁运”后几乎全被美国控制，美国可以任意决定收购锡兰橡胶数量，左右橡胶的价格。
    制造落后和贫困
    美国的扩张政策严重地损害着亚洲及太平洋区域各国的经济。由于美国垄断资本家贪婪地向各国进行掠取资源和倾销商品，使各国工业和农业都受到剧烈的摧残。拉丁美洲各国已成了替美国供应原料和销售工业品的附属物，只能依靠向美国输出一种或数种产品维持其国民经济，重工业固然无从发展，就是轻工业和农业也都受到严重的摧残。例如美国为了要在哥伦比亚推销汽车，便极力破坏该国建筑铁路的计划。古巴因为大部分耕地都被用来替美国生产原料而不能种稻，每年产米不到所需量的四分之一，因此要从美国输入大量粮食。亚洲各国也遭受着相同的命运。像以雪茄烟闻名世界的菲律宾，每年都被迫输入值二千四百万美元的美国香烟。美国在印尼倾销美国和日本的纺织品，使印尼大量纺织厂关门和减产。日本因为美国粮食大量输入，稻田的面积已缩小了百分之二十四。美国为了保持高度的利润，同时打击它的对手英国，极力鼓励日本工业品向东南亚倾销，结果却使日本由于对英镑区贸易出超而造成英镑过剩的危机（因为英国须将英镑区的原料输美换取美元，日本不能将这笔巨额的英镑外汇换取所需的原料），日本政府只能采取限制出口的措施挽救这种危机，这就使得日本的出口贸易大受打击。由于滞销，日本积存的钢铁制品到今年三月底仅普通钢材一项即达六十万吨以上；全国纺织厂被迫把产量减少百分之四十，许多纺织厂倒闭；其他人造丝、橡皮工业等也被迫削减生产。
    美国的“封锁”与“禁运”政策更加重了对各国经济的损害。亚洲和太平洋区域各国，由于被迫割断与中苏等国的正常贸易关系，必需更加依赖美国，而陷入严重的经济危机之中。例如日本因为不能从中国购买廉价的工业原料而需以高价从美国输入，就使工业制成品成本增加，价格高昂而无法在国际市场上竞争，使工商业大受影响。又如印尼的橡胶，因为丧失了中国的主顾，美国又故意以停购来抑低价格，而使橡胶价格惨跌，存货堆积，迫使印尼橡胶生产大大削减，去年民间橡胶的产量就已比前一年减少了九万四千吨，橡胶工厂纷纷倒闭，整个印尼的经济生活都受到危害。马来亚今年一月橡胶的输出，据英国官方公布，比去年十二月减少了二万一千多吨，新加坡就有六千工人失业。这都是美国强迫实行“禁运”与“封锁”而造成的恶果。
    美国的经济侵略给亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民带来极其深重的灾难。拉丁美洲在美国的榨取下，人民生活日益恶化，根据官方统计，有三分之二的人经常吃不饱；东南亚各国每个人每年的收入只有三十到六十美元，在有些地区每人的粮食消费量甚至还未恢复到战前水准；日本失业和半失业人数达到一千八百万以上。
    各国人民愈来愈强烈地反对美国的扩张政策，各国工商界人士都力图摆脱美国加在他们身上的枷锁，各国政府也因为美国的扩张给他们国家造成严重经济危机而忐忑不安。拉丁美洲各国人民反对与美国签订所谓“双边协定”，使美国进一步进行经济和军事侵略的阴谋受到了挫折。亚洲各国人民也日益看清楚美国掠夺和准备战争的凶恶面目。去年十月在新加坡举行的国际贸易会议中，印度和锡兰的代表就提出要求改进贸易关系。印尼总理韦洛坡最近公开指责美国的“禁运”措施是歧视并违反亚洲各国民族利益的政策。锡兰不顾美国的恐吓，希望与中国进行贸易。日本的民族工商业家一致要求开展对中国的贸易，并与中国签订了交换货物的协议。这些事实都有力地说明，亚洲及太平洋各国人民都不能忍受美国对他们的控制和限制，积极要求各国之间建立平等互利与互助合作的国际贸易关系，反对美国的经济侵略活动与准备战争的阴谋。
