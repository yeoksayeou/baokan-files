Moscow Under Construction
    Moscow City Chief Architect, Academician of the Soviet Academy of Architecture, Stalin Prize Winner, A. Vlasov

    Editor's Note: September 7th this year marks the 805th anniversary of the founding of Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union. This article by Moscow City Chief Architect A. Vlasov provides a detailed introduction to Moscow's history, current situation, and future development prospects, and points out the characteristics and advantages of urban construction and development plans in socialist countries.

    More than eight hundred years ago, on the high bank near the confluence of the Neglinnaya River and the Moscow River, Moscow—the capital of the world's first socialist country—was founded.

    Pre-revolutionary Moscow was filled with the typical characteristics of all cities in capitalist countries. The central streets, boulevards, and wealthy residential areas were extremely luxurious, forming a stark contrast with the proletarian suburbs and slums.

    The Great October Socialist Revolution finally brought a dramatic change to Moscow's subsequent development.

    During the pre-war Stalin Five-Year Plans, Moscow's appearance underwent fundamental changes. The total residential area of the Soviet capital more than doubled. Thousands of tall buildings have now been built on the reconstructed main traffic arteries, on the streets bordering the riverbanks, and on the city's squares, and brand-new streets have emerged.

    From 1935, the general plan for the reconstruction of Moscow, proposed by Comrade Stalin and adopted by the Soviet People's Committee and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), began to be implemented. The Soviet people also called this great plan Stalin's genius plan.

    The areas of new high-rise buildings grew up in the former working-class suburbs. Slums ceased to exist.

    "Moscow's contribution lies in the complete eradication of these slums and in enabling the working people to move from cellars and huts into the capitalists' high-rise buildings, into completely new houses equipped by the Soviet regime."

    This characteristic of Moscow, pointed out by Comrade Stalin, stands in stark contrast to the situation in the capitals of capitalist countries. Concessions, Jewish quarters, slums—these are the inevitable parts of modern capitalist cities produced by the shameful capitalist system of exploitation.

    Thousands of buildings belonging to schools, cultural and educational institutions, and municipal institutions have been built on Moscow's land. New parks, gardens, and boulevards decorate the entire city. Moscow's streets and alleys have donned verdant finery.

    The construction of the Moscow Canal, extending 128 kilometers, fundamentally solved the capital's water supply problem. After the completion of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, Moscow has become a port connecting five seas.

    The scale of Moscow's construction is expanding year by year. In 1950, Moscow's builders constructed 535,000 square meters of residential housing—almost 50 percent more than in the pre-war year of 1940. In 1951, 735,000 square meters of residential housing came into use, and the plan for 1952 stipulates the use of 750,000 square meters of residential housing. The task of Moscow's builders is to increase the annual construction of residential housing to 1 million square meters.

    In 1947, during the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the founding of Moscow, Comrade Stalin wrote in a congratulatory telegram: "Now, Moscow is not only the source of the construction of a new life for the working people of the capital, a life that has freed millions of poor people and unemployed from the threat of hunger and cold. Moscow is also a new model in the above aspects for major cities all over the world."

    The development of Soviet culture and technology has created conditions for the further development of Moscow's construction. Moscow now has a new artistic face, in which Comrade Stalin's plan to build high-rise buildings has played a very significant role.

    The towering buildings are like a central point, around which Moscow's other new constructions are carried out. In capitalist countries, the construction of high-rise buildings not only does not increase the beauty of the city, but on the contrary, gives the city a gloomy and chaotic feeling. This is the face of New York, Chicago, and other large cities in capitalist countries. In order to make Moscow's architecture completely different from the chaotic architecture of other large cities in capitalist countries, the Soviet government takes the close connection between the architectural style of these high-rise buildings and Moscow's national characteristics as a fundamental task to complete.

    The first batch of high-rise buildings has been completed this year. Ten-story, twelve-story, and fourteen-story residences are also being built around them. In this way, a comprehensive complex in terms of architecture is formed, forming the coordination of the new architecture of socialist Moscow.

    Now, let us imagine crossing the time limit of 1952 and take a look at the prospects of several major traffic arteries in Moscow....

    We first arrived at the Moscow entrance of the wide Moscow-Minsk highway. Here, at the historically significant Poklonnaya Hill, where Napoleon once waited in vain in 1812 for the Russians to offer the key to entering the city of Moscow, a wide entrance square is being built.

    On one side of the square, the Soviet Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metals has begun to build ten-story and twelve-story buildings.

    Let us imagine passing through the surrounding railway lines. In the place of past cemeteries and old buildings, we can see a huge complex composed of various residential buildings growing there. A major traffic artery connecting the Mozhaisk highway with the center of Moscow is under construction. This road will extend directly to the towering hotel on the Dorogomilovskaya Embankment, to the New Arbat Bridge, and further to the heart of Moscow—the Kremlin.

    We also see the square of Kiev Station. The center of the square is a garden decorated with many sculptures. The twelve-story building of the Soviet Ministry of Petroleum Industry will stand on the edge of the square near the Borodino Bridge.

    Moving forward, we can see the spire of the building on Smolensk Square shining with metallic light. The snow-white building faces the Moscow River. Smolensk Street, this narrow slope leading to the bridge, will be widened, and multi-story buildings will be built on its edges. The Smolensk Embankment, the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, and the Dorogomilovskaya Embankment have now been connected into a complete chain of construction sites, and newly built houses are shining white everywhere.

    On the other side of the bend of the Moscow River, behind the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment building, on Uprising Square, a high-rise building has already been erected. The spire of the white stone building is decorated with the Soviet national emblem, and this towering building is 152 meters high. In 1952, this house will provide 450 residences for the working people of Moscow. The appearance of its surroundings will also change. The work of reconstructing the square will begin soon, and many new buildings will be built on the square. Some old houses existing on the square will be demolished or moved elsewhere.

    In Moscow, an architectural harmony is being produced, and as witnesses and active participants in this country's new prosperity, we are happy.

    In 1952, ten-story buildings will be built for metallurgical workers on the Yaroslavl Highway and on Smolensk Embankment; buildings will also be built for petroleum workers on Dorogomilovskaya Embankment, and a thirteen-story building will be built on Varvarka Street.

    Ten-story and twelve-story housing will be built extensively on Smolensk Embankment, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment, Krasnokholmskaya Embankment, and Frunzenskaya Embankment, on Mozhaisk Highway, on Tchaikovsky Street, and on Begovaya Street. Large-scale construction projects are underway on New Sands Street.

    On Lenin Hills, the building of Moscow State University will become the architectural foundation and center of the new southeastern district of the capital. Here, in addition to many scientific and cultural institutions, in recent years, a huge complex with millions of square meters of residential area and all kinds of residences will be built. 1952 is the beginning of residential construction in this area, and this construction is based on the highest principles of socialist urban construction. The first apartment to be built in this area will be a fourteen- to sixteen-story building. In the 610 residences in this building, the living area will exceed 25,000 square meters. In recent years, even larger apartments will be built in this area. The living area of each apartment will reach 50,000 square meters.

    The main traffic artery is also under construction—this will become the southern radius of the capital. Here, the construction of ten-story housing will begin this year.

    Construction workers have developed the idea of using prefabricated reinforced concrete assembly materials manufactured in factories to build high-rise buildings, and they will continue to develop this most advanced construction method and make it even more perfect. Dozens of building industrial factories that manufacture such reinforced concrete, gypsum, ceramics, insulators, and other materials are currently under construction. It is enough to point out that just two reinforced concrete assembly material manufacturing plants under construction can guarantee the annual production of materials sufficient to build residential housing with a living area of 700,000 to 800,000 square meters.

    Moscow, the capital of a socialist country that illuminates the path of tens of millions of people with its radiance, a strong bastion of world peace, is developing and becoming more beautiful day by day. (Attached picture)

    莫斯科在建设中
    莫斯科市总建筑师  苏联建筑学院院士  斯大林奖金获得者  阿·符拉索夫
    编者按：今年九月七日是苏联首都莫斯科建市八百零五周年纪念日。莫斯科市总建筑师阿·符拉索夫这篇文章，对莫斯科的历史、现状及其发展前途作了较详尽的介绍，并指出了社会主义国家都市建设和发展计划的特点和优越性。
    八百多年以前，在莫斯科河的涅格林卡河入口处附近的高岸边，莫斯科——这个世界上第一个社会主义国家的首都，就在那里奠下基础了。
    革命以前的莫斯科是充满着资本主义国家所有城市的典型特征的。中心街道、林荫道和富豪住宅区万分奢侈，与无产阶级居住的郊区和贫民窟形成了一个极为尖锐的对照。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命终于给莫斯科以后的发展带来了一个剧烈的转变。
    在战前斯大林五年计划的时期中，莫斯科的面貌是根本地改观了。这个苏联首都的居住面积总数增加到了一倍半以上。在经过改造的主要交通干线上，在濒临河岸的街道上，在城市的广场上，现在已建筑起了成千座的高楼大厦，出现了崭新的街道。
    从一九三五年起，开始实施由斯大林同志所提议并经苏联人民委员会和联共（布）中央委员会通过的改建莫斯科的总计划。苏联人民并将这个伟大计划称为斯大林的天才计划。
    新建的高楼大厦的区域就在以前工人居住的郊区中成长起来。贫民窟永不存在了。
    “莫斯科所作的贡献，是在于完全铲除了这些贫民窟，并且使劳动人民能够从地窖和茅屋中搬进资本家的高楼大厦，搬进苏维埃政权所建筑的设备完全的新屋。”
    斯大林同志所指出的莫斯科的这个特征，和资本主义国家首都的情况恰恰形成了一个极强烈的对比。租界、犹太区、贫民窟——这些就是由可耻的资本主义剥削制度所产生的现代资本主义城市中的不可避免的一部分。
    在莫斯科的土地上，建造起了成千座属于学校、文化教育机关和市政机关的大厦。新的公园、花圃和林荫道装饰着整个城市。莫斯科的街道里巷已穿上了葱翠的盛装。
    展延长达一百二十八公里的莫斯科运河的建筑，根本上解决了首都的供水问题。在列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河建成以后，莫斯科已成为一个连接五海的港口了。
    莫斯科建设的规模，一年比一年地扩大着。一九五○年，莫斯科的建设者们建筑了五十三万五千平方公尺居住面积的住宅——比战前一九四○年几乎增加了百分之五十。一九五一年，有七十三万五千平方公尺居住面积的住宅开始使用，而一九五二年的计划规定要使用七十五万平方公尺居住面积的住宅。莫斯科建设者们的任务，是要增加到每年建筑一百万平方公尺居住面积的住宅。
    一九四七年，在庆祝莫斯科建市八百周年纪念的时候，斯大林同志曾在贺电中写道：“现在，莫斯科不仅是建设首都劳动者新生活的发源地，这种生活已经解除千百万贫民和失业者的挨饿受冻的威胁。莫斯科同时是全世界各大都会在上述方面的新的模范。”
    苏维埃文化及技术的发展，为莫斯科建设的进一步发展创造了条件。莫斯科现在具有着新的艺术的面貌，在这方面，斯大林同志所提议的建设高楼大厦的计划，是起了非常巨大的作用的。
    高耸的大厦就像一个中心点，它的周围进行着莫斯科的其他新的建筑。在资本主义国家中，高楼大厦的建筑不仅没有增加城市的美观，相反地，还给城市以阴沉的、紊乱的感觉。这就是纽约、芝加哥及其他资本主义国家大城市的面貌。为了使莫斯科的建筑迥然不同于其他资本主义国家大城市的杂乱的建筑，苏联政府将这些高楼大厦的建筑风格与莫斯科的民族特色密切地联系起来这一点，作为一个基本任务来完成。
    第一批高楼大厦已经在本年内完工了。其四周还建造着十层、十二层、十四层不等的住宅。这样，就形成了一个建筑上的全面的综合体，形成了社会主义莫斯科的新建筑的协调。
    现在，让我们想像跨过一九五二年的时间界限，来看一看莫斯科几条主要交通干线的远景吧……。
    我们首先到了宽广的莫斯科—明斯克公路的莫斯科入口处。这里，一八一二年拿破仑曾经徒然地等待过俄罗斯人献出进入莫斯科城之钥的有历史意义的伯克隆那雅山麓，正在建筑着一个宽广的入口广场。
    在广场的一边，苏联有色金属部已动手建造着十层及十二层的大厦。
    再让我们设想通过周围的铁路线吧。在过去的墓地及旧建筑物的地方，我们可以看到一个由各色住宅所组成的庞大的综合体在那里成长起来了。一条将莫日依斯克公路与莫斯科中心地点连接起来的主要交通干线正在建筑中。这条道路将直接伸向多罗戈米罗夫河岸街的高耸的旅馆，伸向新阿尔巴特桥，并进一步伸向莫斯科的心脏——克里姆林宫。
    我们也看到基辅站的广场。广场的中心是一个有许多雕刻装饰着的花圃。苏联石油工业部的十二层大厦将矗立于鲍罗琴诺桥附近的广场边上。
    再向前进，我们就可以看到斯摩棱斯克广场上大厦的尖顶闪耀着金属的光辉。雪白的大厦正面对着莫斯科河。斯摩棱斯克街，这条狭窄的通桥的斜坡路，将被拓宽，在它的边上，将建筑起多层的高楼来。斯摩棱斯克河岸街、克拉斯诺普列斯涅河岸街和多罗戈米罗夫河岸街，现在已连结成为一连串完整的建筑场了，新造的房子到处在闪耀着白光。
    在莫斯科河弯曲处的彼岸，在克拉斯诺普列斯涅河岸街大厦的后面，在起义广场上，已经矗立起了一座高楼。白石砌成的大厦的尖顶上装置了苏联的国徽，这座耸入天际的大厦高达一百五十二公尺。一九五二年，这座房子将供给莫斯科劳动人民四百五十个住宅。它的四周围的面貌也将改观。最近就要展开改建该广场的工作，并在广场上建造起许多新的大厦来。广场上现有的一些旧房子将被拆掉或移至别处。
    在莫斯科，一种建筑的协调在产生着，作为这个国家新的繁荣的目击者和积极参加者，我们是幸福的。
    一九五二年，在雅罗斯拉夫公路边及在斯摩棱斯克河岸街上，将要给冶金工作人员建造起十层楼的大厦来；在多罗戈米罗夫河岸街也要给石油员工建造大厦，在伐罗伐雅街则要建造一座十三层楼的大厦。
    在斯摩棱斯克河岸街、戈介尔尼克河岸街、克拉斯诺霍姆河岸街和伏龙芝河岸街上，在莫日依斯克公路边，在柴柯夫斯基街和别戈瓦雅街将普遍地建造起十层、十二层的住房来。在新砂街上，大规模的建筑工程正在进行着。
    在列宁山上，国立莫斯科大学的大厦，将成为首都新的东南区的建筑基础及中心地。这里，除了许多科学与文化的机关外，在最近几年中，就要建造起一个最庞大的、有数百万平方公尺居住面积和各色各样住宅的综合体。一九五二年是在这个区域内进行住宅建设的开始，而这个建设是基于社会主义城市建设的最高原则之上的。在这个区域建造起来的第一所公寓将是十四层到十六层的大厦。在这座大厦的六百一十个住宅中，居住面积将超过二万五千平方公尺。在最近几年中，在这个区域里，还要建造起更大的公寓来。每一个公寓的居住面积将要达到五万平方公尺。
    主要的交通干线也在建造着——这将成为首都的南部半径。这里，今年就开始建造十层楼的住房。
    建筑工作者们发展了用工厂中制就的现成的钢筋水泥的装配材料来建造高楼大厦的想法，并且还要将这最先进的建筑方法继续发展，使其更臻完美。目前正在建造几十个这种制造钢筋水泥、石膏、陶器、绝缘器和其他材料的建筑工业工厂。只要指出这一点就够了：仅仅两个正在建造中的钢筋水泥装配材料制造厂，就能保证每年生产足够建造七十万到八十万平方公尺居住面积的住宅所需要的材料。
    莫斯科，这个以自己的光芒照亮了千万人民的道路的社会主义国家的首都，世界和平的坚强堡垒，正在日益发展着，并日益变得美丽起来。（附图片）
