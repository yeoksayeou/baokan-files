    Absolutely No Empty Promises
    Chen Xiuying, Sixth State Cotton Mill, Speaking, Recorded by Xiaoying and Wei Xiuyun

    I am an old female worker who has been working for half her life, and I am forty-five years old this year. Speaking of my joining the quick literacy class, I really encountered many difficulties. Feeding the child three times a day means studying one and a half hours less than others. My eyes are not good, and the characters look like black ants, which is really frustrating. When I first learned pinyin, my tongue couldn't bend properly, and the sounds were not easy to distinguish accurately. When I got home at night, there were six children, big and small, making noise. After taking care of them and giving them baths, I had to prepare dinner. By the time I finished cleaning up, I had just spelled a few sentences when the children who weren't asleep started arguing. A four-year-old kept pestering me to learn: "Dad, Dad! Mom, Mom!" The anger in my heart rushed to my head, my tongue got tied, and it felt like a lump of phlegm was stuck in my throat, and I couldn't read anymore. I wanted to beat them up, but I couldn't bear to. Thinking that my pinyin would be checked tomorrow, I couldn't help but throw the book on the bed and cry sadly.

    "Old woman, what's wrong?" It turned out to be my husband coming home. When I saw him, I answered straightforwardly: "I'm not going to embarrass myself tomorrow..."

    Seeing me like this, the old man sighed and said, "For generations, our family hasn't known a single character. If you could learn earlier, wouldn't you be able to help me when I learn? I heard that our Shenxin No. 2 Factory is about to start a school as well. Think about it, didn't you promise to write a letter to Chairman Mao a month after you started learning? If you don't learn now, isn't that making empty promises? I heard a few days ago that your eyes aren't good, so today I specially bought a pair of glasses for you. Put them on and try them. From tomorrow onwards, besides going to work and attending meetings, I will take care of bathing the children and everything else. I promise to let you study peacefully." After saying that, he put the book on the bed into my hand. I don't know how, but my anger disappeared! I thought: "How can I make empty promises? I must overcome the difficulties. Learn! As long as you put in the effort, an iron rod can be ground into a needle. No matter how great the difficulties, people can always overcome them."

    From then on, I wore my reading glasses every day, put the children to bed early at night, and read quietly under the electric light until twelve o'clock. When I got sleepy, I wiped myself with a wet towel. During the day, I didn't let go of a minute, and even looked at new words while breastfeeding. The books were always by my side, and I even thought about them while eating. My brain isn't good, so I can only put in more hard work. On the hottest day, the house was unbearable, and I was so hot that I was covered in itchy heat rash, and my buttocks hurt from sitting. I spread the mat from the bed on the floor and knelt on the soft pillow with my knees to review the new words.

    The sister-in-law from the back building came up to cool off, fanned me a few times, and said, "It's so hot, and you're so old, working so hard, don't study yourself into a nervous breakdown."

    I smiled and didn't answer a word, focusing on circling the new words I couldn't remember and reading them separately. Memorizing by rote wasn't enough. Thinking about the more than three thousand workers in our factory, and that I'm a worker in the cloth weaving workshop, why would I know Jin Mei from the yarn spinning workshop? After thinking for a long time, oh! It turned out that I remembered their faces, like the pictographic word memorization that the teacher talked about. Learning words can also be like this, so I found the key. For example, "country" and "group" are both square faces, and I will never forget these two words – "country," our motherland is so good, "group," the Youth League members are ideologically progressive and willing to help us old workers. In this way, on the second day, I recognized 226 out of 230 words, and Mr. Gu and the young teacher encouraged me to find more ways to overcome the difficulties.

    When I reached the reading stage, I cried and laughed every day when I read books and newspapers. One day, I saw the story of Liu Hulan in a book under a telegraph pole, and tears streamed down my face. When I saw something funny, I laughed loudly. Old Man A-Kun next door ran over and said to me, "Oh dear, old woman, you're acting crazy. You've only read a few books and you're putting on airs!"

    After hearing this, I thought: This old man's words are really deceptive! So I replied to him impolitely: "Old Man A-Kun, don't think that just because you know how to read, you can look down on people by relying on your age. If you don't believe me, I'll read the newspaper to you." At this time, the neighbors gathered around as if watching a show. I first read the story of Qi Jianhua creating the quick literacy method in the book, and then I read the story of Gao Yubao in the Labor Daily. Everyone shed tears after listening to Gao Yubao's story. After reading, Old Man A-Kun was still not convinced, saying that I had prepared it long ago. He pointed to the slogans on the wall and said, "Recognize these two slogans for me!"

    I calmly read: "Celebrate the August 1st Army Day! Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu De!"

    Everyone clapped and laughed. Old Man A-Kun nodded repeatedly and said, "I admire it, I admire it! Under the leadership of the Communist Party, it really has a way to keep its promises!" Now, after a month of study, I wrote the first letter to Chairman Mao, and the second letter to my own mother, reporting that I have been elected as a study model. When I return to the workshop, I will further learn from the workers' production experience with an open mind and strive to become a labor model again.

    决不空口说白话
    国棉六厂  陈秀英　讲  晓英、韦秀云记
    我是一个做了半辈子工的老女工，今年四十五岁。谈到我进速成识字班学习，真是不晓得碰到多少困难。一天喂小孩三次奶，就比别人少学一个半钟头，眼睛也不灵，看起字来像黑蚂蚁一样，真急人。刚学拼音时舌头弯不转，音也不容易别得准。晚上回家，大大小小六个小囡，吵吵闹闹的，照顾他们洗好澡还要忙夜饭，等收拾停当，刚拼了几句，旁边没有睡的小囡吵架了，一个四岁的又缠着跟我学：“爸啊爸！妈啊妈！”我心里的火直往头上冒，舌头就打起疙瘩来，喉咙里像塞住一口痰似的，再也念不下去。我恨起来就要打他们一顿，但心里又舍不得。想到我明天拼音要交账，就忍不住的把书往床上一甩，伤心的哭了起来。
    “老太婆啥事情呀？”原来是我丈夫回来了。我见了他，就爽爽气气的回答：“明天我不去现世了，……”
    老头子见我这样，叹了一口气说：“家里几代不识个扁担长的一字，要是你能早点学会了，等我再学，不是能帮助我了吗？听说我们申新二厂也快要办啦，你再想想，第一天参加学习时你不是保证一个月后要写信给毛主席吗？假使现在不学了，不是空口说白话吗？前几天听说你眼睛不灵，今天我特地买了副眼镜，快戴起来试试看，从明天起，我除了放工开会外，替小囡洗澡等等都由我来作，保证让你笃笃定定安心学习。”说完就把床上的书放到我手里，我也不知怎的气就没啦！我想：“我怎么能空口说白话？我一定要克服困难。学吧！只要工夫深，铁杵也能磨成绣花针，天大困难，总是人克服的。”
    从此我每天戴上了老光眼镜，晚上把孩子早点哄睡觉，自己就一人在电灯下轻轻的读到十二点钟，瞌睡虫来了，就用湿毛巾揩揩。在白天，也不放松一分钟时间，连喂奶时也要看生字。书本时时刻刻在我身边，连吃饭也会想到它，我脑子不灵，只有多下苦工夫。在最热的一天，屋子里登不住人，热得我混身痱子发痒，坐得屁股痛，我就把床上的席子铺在地板上，膝头跪在软软的枕头上面复习生字。
    后楼的嫂嫂乘风凉上来，就拿着把扇子，一面替我扇几下，一面说：“大热天，这么大年纪，这样巴结，不要学出神经病来。”
    我笑了笑一句话也没回答，一门心思把记不住的生字圈起来，专门另外读。靠死记还是不够，想到我们厂里三千多个工人，我是布机间的工人，为啥会认得摇纱间金妹呢？想了半天，喔！原来是记住了他们的面孔，像先生说过的象形记字，学字也可以这样，我就找到了门槛。比如国、团都是方面孔，这两个字永远也忘不掉——“国”，我们的祖国多好呀，“团”，青年团员思想进步，肯帮助我们老工人。这样到了第二天二百三十个字，就识了二百二十六个，顾先生和小先生还鼓励我再想办法克服困难。
    到了阅读阶段，看书看报我每天有哭有笑。有一天，我在电线木杆下看到书上刘胡兰的故事，我淌下了眼泪，看到开心的地方就大笑起来。隔壁阿坤爷跑过来对着我说：“喔唷老太婆，你在发痴了，读了几天书，就装腔作势起来！”
    我听了后心想：这老头子讲话真欺人！就不客气的回他：“阿坤爷别以为你识了字，就倚老卖老的看不起人，不相信读书读报给你听。”这时邻居们像看啥个热闹一样围了过来。我先读书上祁建华创造速成识字法的故事，又读了劳动报上高玉宝的故事，大家听了高玉宝的故事都淌下了眼泪。读完了，阿坤爷还是不服气，说是我老早准备好的，他顺手指着墙上的标语说：“这两张标语，你认认看！”
    我就不慌不忙的读着：“庆祝八一建军节，毛主席万岁！朱德总司令万岁！”
    大家拍手笑了起来，阿坤爷连连点头说：“我佩服、我佩服在共产党领导下，说到做到真有办法！”现在我经过一个月学习，第一封信写给毛主席，第二封信写给亲生的老娘，报告我已当选了学习模范，回到车间，还要进一步向工人群众虚心学习生产经验，争取再做劳动模范。（原载八月二十二日上海“劳动报”）
