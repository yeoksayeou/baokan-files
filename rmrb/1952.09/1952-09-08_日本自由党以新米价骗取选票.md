Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The Yoshida faction of the Liberal Party of Japan is trying every possible means to deceive voters. Just three days after Yoshida was forced to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold early general elections—August 30th—the Yoshida Liberal Party government hurriedly decided to raise the producer price of rice from 7,030 yen per koku to 7,500 yen. Kyodo News Agency said that this was meant to be a "gift" to farmers before the election.

The new rice price regulations stipulate various "bonuses" for those who deliver grain above the prescribed quantity or pay in advance, making the price per koku as high as 10,600 yen. However, only landlords and rich peasants have surplus rice to sell to the government in excess of the quota. Poor peasants who are short of food before the new harvest are simply unable to deliver more or pay in advance.

The new rice price has increased consumer prices by 10 percent, from 620 yen per kilogram to 686 yen. Rice merchants will therefore reap huge profits, and the Liberal Party will be able to extract a large amount of election funds, amounting to hundreds of millions, from rice merchants centered in Dojima, Osaka.

Kyodo News Agency said: The increase in rice prices not only affected the black market rice price, but also indirectly affected non-staple foods. Housewives and groups such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan have launched protest movements.

    日本自由党以新米价骗取选票
    【新华社讯】东京消息，日本自由党吉田集团正在千方百计地骗取选票。就在吉田被迫解散众院提前举行大选的第三天——八月三十日，吉田自由党政府急忙决定将米的生产者价格从每石七千零三十日元提高到七千五百日元。共同社说，这是在选举前向农民“送礼”的意思。
    新米价规定纳粮超过规定数量或提前缴纳者有种种“奖金”，使每石价格达到一万零六百日元之多。但是有余米超额卖给政府的只有地主和富农。青黄不接的贫农，是根本无法多纳也无法提前缴纳的。
    新米价使消费者价格提高百分之十，从每公斤六百二十日元提高到六百八十六日元。米商将因此大获暴利，并使自由党得以从以大阪堂岛为中心的米商那里捞得一笔数以亿计的大选资金。
    共同社说：提高米价不仅影响了黑市米价，而且也间接影响了副食品，家庭主妇们和日本工会总评议会等团体已发起抗议运动。
