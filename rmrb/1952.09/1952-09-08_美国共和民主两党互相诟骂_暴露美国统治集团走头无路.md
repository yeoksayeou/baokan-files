Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Due to the serious failures of the United States' aggressive plans around the world, the issue of U.S. foreign aggression policy has become the central issue of fierce debate between the two major parties of the U.S. ruling group, the Republican and Democratic parties, in the current election campaign. The two parties unscrupulously scold each other in order to deceive and win votes, which not only exposes the despicable faces of the politicians raised by Wall Street, but also further proves that neither the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party can find a way out for U.S. imperialism.

Eisenhower, who was bought by Wall Street to serve as the Republican presidential candidate, was once a loyal executor of Truman's policies. Now he has changed his tone and blamed the failures of the aggressive plans he personally participated in entirely on the Truman administration. Eisenhower and Dulles, the Republican foreign policy advisor, in their campaign speeches in late August and early September, listed the facts that the Democratic government's current policies have been hitting walls everywhere, and took the opportunity to attack them vigorously. Eisenhower called Truman's policies "full of flaws." He scolded the current government for "clumsily" launching the irretrievable Korean War. He said that the Truman administration's method of carrying out an arms race around the world and encircling the peaceful democratic camp was a futile "wrong action." He believes that this method cannot achieve the United States' aggressive goals, nor can it prevent the ever-consolidation and growth of the peaceful democratic camp. Dulles further accused Truman's policy of being a "suicidal policy." He said that the United States, by coercing Western European vassal states into an arms race, has fallen into an extremely unfavorable position "strategically and in propaganda." Dulles said, "Only a new policy and the downfall of the Democratic Party" can avoid the "fatal disaster" of the complete disintegration of the United States' aggressive plans.

According to Eisenhower's statement at the American Legion Convention in New York on August 25, the so-called "new policy" that the Republican Party is preparing to replace the Democratic government's current policy is: in order to defeat the Soviet Union, the United States must establish "strong" attack forces, and at the same time restore the imperialist enslavement system in Eastern Europe, China, and various Asian people's democratic countries. Eisenhower and Dulles shamelessly called this war policy the "liberation" policy. However, the method is to use so-called "peaceful methods." The "peaceful methods" they listed are no different from Truman's current aggressive policy.

Republican politicians have racked their brains to try to distinguish themselves from the Democratic government with this loud shouting and scolding, but this cannot hide the emptiness of their scolding. Therefore, this clumsy trick was immediately ridiculed and countered by the Democratic Party. On the 2nd of this month, Truman gave a speech at Buckhannon Station in West Virginia, attacking the Republican Party for using "dirty" tactics. He said, "They care about nothing but the votes in November." In his speech, Truman proved that Eisenhower's and Dulles's proposals are nothing new compared to the Democratic government's current policies. The aggressive goal that the Republican Party flaunts is precisely the goal that he has said more than once that "the United States must always strive for." At the same time, Truman hinted that Dulles's suggestion of inciting subversive activities in people's democratic countries has long been the work that the current government is doing "by all means." Truman accused the Republican Party's reckless war cries of not only being unhelpful, but also "talking about liberation is talking about war," which "causes great anxiety among our European friends," further exposing the United States' war policy, and thus making the United States' situation even more isolated. The day before Truman's speech, Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson also lashed out at the Republican Party's remarks as "reckless and useless intimidation," and he declared that what the Republican Party put forward was nothing more than "empty promises seeking miraculous solutions."

In this way, the Republican Party's boasting and the Democratic Party's self-proclaimed "wisdom" were mutually exposed in rude scolding. This quarrel about the United States' aggressive policy once again exposed the distress and annoyance of the U.S. two-party ruling group.

    美国共和民主两党互相诟骂
    暴露美国统治集团走头无路
    【新华社六日讯】由于美国在全世界的侵略计划遭受严重的失败，美国对外侵略政策的问题，已成为美国统治集团的两大政党共和党和民主党在目前竞选活动中激烈争吵的中心问题。两党为骗取竞选资本而不择手段地互相诟骂，不仅暴露了华尔街豢养的政客们的可耻面目，而且进一步证明了不论是民主党还是共和党，都不可能替美帝国主义找到出路。
    为华尔街收买来充当共和党总统候选人的艾森豪威尔，曾经是杜鲁门政策的忠实执行人。现在他竟然改变腔调，把他亲自参与的侵略计划失败的责任，一古脑推给杜鲁门政府。艾森豪威尔和共和党外交政策顾问杜勒斯在八月下旬和本月初发表的历次竞选演说中，列举民主党政府现行政策到处碰壁的事实，并乘机大肆攻击。艾森豪威尔把杜鲁门的政策叫做“破绽百出”的政策。他责骂现政府“笨手笨脚”地发动了不可收拾的朝鲜战争。他说：杜鲁门政府在全世界进行扩军备战和包围和平民主阵营的办法是徒劳无功的“错误行动”。他认为这种办法既不能实现美国的侵略目标，又不能阻止和平民主阵营的日益巩固和壮大。杜勒斯进一步指责说：杜鲁门政策是“自杀的政策”。他说：美国由于胁迫西欧附庸国家扩军备战，已在“战略上和宣传上”陷于极其不利的地位。杜勒斯说：“只有新的政策与民主党下台”，才能避免美国侵略计划全盘瓦解的“致命的灾难”。
    按照艾森豪威尔八月二十五日在纽约美国退伍军人团代表大会上的说法，共和党准备以之代替民主党政府现行政策的所谓“新政策”就是：为了击败苏联，美国必须建立“强大”的攻击部队，同时要在东欧、中国以及亚洲各人民民主国家恢复帝国主义的奴役制度。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯厚颜无耻地把这种战争政策叫作“解放”政策。但其方法则是用所谓“和平方法”。他们所列举的“和平方法”，和杜鲁门现行的侵略政策，又并无二致。
    共和党政客们费尽心机企图以这种高声叫嚣和怒骂来区别于民主党政府，但是这并不能掩饰他们这种叫骂的空泛。因此，这种笨拙的伎俩立即遭到了民主党对它的嘲笑和还击。本月二日，杜鲁门在西弗吉尼亚州巴克尔斯堡车站发表演说，攻击共和党手段“下流”，他说“他们除了十一月的选票以外，什么也不顾了”。杜鲁门在演说中证明艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯的主张比起民主党政府现行政策毫无新鲜之处。共和党所标榜的侵略目标，正是他曾不止一次地说过“美国要永远为之努力”的目标。杜鲁门同时暗示：杜勒斯建议的在人民民主国家煽动颠覆活动，早已是现政府“用尽一切办法”在进行的工作。杜鲁门指责共和党鲁莽的战争叫嚣不但于事无补，而且“谈论解放，就是谈论战争”，这“在我们的欧洲朋友之间引起极大的忧虑”，使美国的战争政策更加暴露，因而也使美国的处境更加孤立。在杜鲁门演说的前一天，民主党总统候选人史蒂文森也破口大骂共和党的论调是“信口开河、无用的恫吓”，他宣称共和党所提出的不过是“寻求奇迹式的解决办法的空头诺言”。
    这样，共和党的吹牛和民主党自命的“明智”，就在粗鄙的叫骂声中被相互拆穿。这一场关于美国侵略政策的吵闹，再一次暴露美国两党统治集团的苦闷和烦恼。
