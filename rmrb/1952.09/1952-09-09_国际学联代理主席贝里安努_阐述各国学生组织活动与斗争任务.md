Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 8th: The Council meeting of the International Union of Students (IUS) began on the 5th in Bucharest. The meeting has heard a report by IUS Acting President Berianu on the first item on the agenda: "On the activities of the International Union of Students and national student organizations in 1951-1952, and their tasks in the struggle for the needs and interests of students," and discussed this report on the 6th.

Berianu's report stated that the expansion of armaments by capitalist countries is the main reason for the deteriorating living and studying conditions of students in these countries. In many countries, the already small number of scholarships has been drastically reduced; in Latin America, some don't even know what a scholarship is. Berianu then compared the situation and living standards of students in capitalist countries with those of students in the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union today has more than 1.41 million university students, and 320,000 students entered institutions of higher education this year.

Berianu then spoke about the current tasks of the IUS and student organizations in capitalist countries. He called for redoubled efforts to fight for increased education funding, improved living conditions for students, and the most active support for the preparations for the International Conference for the Defense of Youth Rights, scheduled for February 1953. He emphasized that united action by all student organizations or groups striving for the interests of students, regardless of religious or political beliefs, is an indispensable condition for meeting the economic demands of students and defending their rights and democratic freedoms. He called on students all over the world to wage a relentless struggle against the use of science to slaughter humanity and against the racial superiority actively promoted by the United States.

Berianu elaborated on the tasks of student organizations in strengthening and consolidating the struggle for peace. He said that students all over the world are opposed to the revival of militarism in West Germany and Japan. The IUS must regard assisting the liberation struggles of West German and Japanese students as its own task. He finally pointed out that students in all countries are resolutely rising up against American aggression in Korea and against the use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors. We call on students all over the world to step up the struggle and demand that all countries participate in and ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological weapons. Student organizations must actively participate in the preparations for the World Peace Congress to be held in Vienna on December 5th.

Student representatives from many countries spoke during the discussion of Berianu's report. Italian representative D'Alessandro said that the number of higher education institutions in Italy is constantly decreasing, and among 230,000 university students, only 59,000 are female. Italian students and progressive youth across the country are united and are now fighting for peace and for the national independence of their motherland.

Tunisian student representative Kader, in his speech, described the extremely difficult lives of Tunisian students, saying that Tunisian education expenditure accounts for only two percent of the national budget. He also introduced the struggle of Tunisian students against the French aggressors. He said that the police persecute progressive youth, but our response to these repressions is strikes and heroic struggle for peace. Kader finally expressed his gratitude to the IUS for its assistance to Tunisian students in their struggle.

Jordanian student representative Ali, who attended the meeting as a guest, said that although the Jordanian government prohibits students from participating in socio-cultural and sports activities, Jordanian students are the vanguard force in the struggle for peace and national independence. We will never allow Jordan to become a springboard for aggression against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. We are intensifying the struggle for national independence and striving to successfully complete the preparations for the World Peace Congress.

Republican Spanish student representative Azcarate said that in Franco's Spain, university graduates have no jobs, some have to work as dockworkers, and many students are imprisoned or exiled. Spanish students particularly emphasize: We do not want war against the Soviet Union, we demand the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

Speaking at the meeting on the 6th were also student representatives from Czechoslovakia, Indonesia, Greece, Korea, Scotland, Hungary, Cuba, Syria, and Venezuela.

    国际学联代理主席贝里安努
    阐述各国学生组织活动与斗争任务
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：国际学生联合会理事会会议五日起在布加勒斯特举行。会议已听取了国际学联代理主席贝里安努就第一项议程“关于一九五一—五二年国际学生联合会及各国学生组织的活动与它们在为学生的需要和利益而进行的斗争中的任务”所作的报告，并在六日讨论了这个报告。
    贝里安努的报告说：资本主义国家的扩张军备运动是这些国家学生生活和学习条件恶化的主要原因。在许多国家，本来为数很少的奖学金已被急剧削减；在拉丁美洲甚至没有人知道奖学金这回事。贝里安努又把资本主义国家学生的境况及生活水准和苏联学生相比，他说：苏联今天有一百四十一万多大学生，今年有三十二万学生进入高等学校。
    贝里安努接着谈到国际学联与资本主义国家学生组织当前的任务，他号召加倍努力进行斗争，争取增加教育经费、改善学生生活状况，并且最积极地支持定于一九五三年二月举行的国际保卫青年权利大会的筹备工作。他强调说：一切为学生的利益而努力的学生组织或团体不分宗教和政治信仰一致行动，是满足学生的经济要求并保卫他们的权利与民主自由所不可少的条件。他号召全世界学生坚持不渝地进行斗争，反对利用科学屠杀人类，反对美国正在积极提倡的种族优越主义。
    贝里安努详细论述了学生组织在加强与巩固和平的斗争中的任务。他说：全世界学生都反对复活西德和日本的军国主义。国际学联必须把援助西德与日本学生的解放斗争当作自己的任务。他最后指出：一切国家的学生都在坚决地起来反对美国侵略朝鲜，反对美国侵略者使用细菌武器。我们号召全世界学生加紧斗争，要求一切国家参加和批准禁止细菌武器的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。学生组织必须积极参加定于十二月五日在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会的筹备工作。
    许多国家的学生代表在讨论贝里安努的报告时发言。意大利代表达列山德罗说：意大利高等学校的数目在不断减少，在二十三万大学生中，女生只有五万九千人。意大利学生和全国进步青年团结一致，现在正为争取和平、争取祖国的民族独立而斗争。
    突尼斯学生代表卡德尔在发言中叙述了突尼斯学生极端困苦的生活，他说：突尼斯教育开支只占国家预算百分之二。他并介绍了突尼斯学生对法国侵略者的斗争。他说：警察迫害进步青年，但我们对这些镇压的答复是罢课，为保卫和平而英勇斗争。卡德尔最后表示感谢国际学联给予斗争中的突尼斯学生的援助。
    以来宾身份出席本届会议的外约旦学生代表阿里说：尽管外约旦政府禁止学生参加社会文化和体育活动，但外约旦学生是争取和平与民族独立斗争的先锋力量，我们决不允许外约旦变为侵略苏联和人民民主国家的跳板，我们在加紧斗争争取民族独立，争取顺利完成世界人民和平大会筹备工作。
    共和西班牙学生代表阿兹卡拉特发言说：在佛朗哥西班牙，大学毕业生因没有工作，有的只得当码头工人、许多学生被关入牢中或被流放。西班牙学生特别着重宣告：我们不要对苏战争，我们要求缔结五大国和平公约。
    在六日会议上发言的还有捷克斯洛伐克、印尼、希腊、朝鲜、苏格兰、匈牙利、古巴、叙利亚和委内瑞拉的学生代表。
