Nine Mu Can Yield One Hundred Shi
By Our Correspondent Tian Liu

Of all the state-owned farms I've seen, the Wu Xiang State-Owned Farm must be the smallest. It has a total of 69.7 mu of cultivated land, which is less than the cultivated land of an average farmer in the Northeast grasslands. The entire farm employs only fourteen people, including the director and the workers. However, after investigation, I found that this state-owned farm has a very significant impact: all 150,000 farmers and 640,000 mu of land in the county are under its direct influence and guidance.

During my visit to this farm, Wu Xiang County was holding an enlarged conference of district and village party and government cadres. Whether it was day or night, as soon as the meeting was adjourned, people flocked to the farm one after another, group after group. Some talked to the farm cadres about their production situation, some asked about difficult cultivation questions, and some just came to have fun, take a walk, or sit for a while before leaving.

"It's really bad luck that this afternoon is the recess time for the conference, and I'm afraid your visit won't go smoothly," Deputy Director Wang said apologetically to me, watching a tall young man walk out the door. This was the fourth guest Deputy Director Wang had seen off in the first half hour of my visit to the farm.

"Who is he?" I pointed to the young man who had just disappeared outside the door. He didn't say a word after he came in, just drank a glass of water and left.

"He's the head of the Dongshang Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. This year, one of their wheat fields, under the guidance of the farm, achieved a high yield of more than 500 jin per mu." After a while, Deputy Director Wang added, "They are familiar with each other, and when they come to the county, they always come to the farm to take a look, whether they have anything to do or not."

We talked about the relationship between the farm and the farmers. Deputy Director Wang said, "It's easy for you to understand this situation, just sit here for half a day and you'll get the hang of it." Then he handed me a thick stack of letters, more than a hundred in total: "These are letters from farmers that we've received in the last three to five days, and you can see some of the relationship between the farm and the farmers from them."

These letters were all written with a brush on rough hemp paper, and many of the characters were crooked. The first letter I pulled out was written by Hao Laihu, the director of the Technical Committee of Nangou Village in the Seventh District. After reporting on the progress of their village's summer hoeing, he said: "The crops in the whole village are growing very well, and the cotton is being topped. Please send a letter explaining the good methods for cultivating cotton used by your farm." The second letter was written by Wang Guiying, a female labor model from Huitong Village. She led the women of the whole village and made new achievements in summer production. She wrote: "Thirty-five women participated in wheat field selection, fourteen women are learning to use the new-style plough to cultivate wheat fields, and four young women, Chen Yinxian and Wang Guilian, have already learned...".

"We receive an average of ten or twenty letters a day," Deputy Director Wang took advantage of the gap between the departure of the last group of guests and the arrival of the new ones to talk to me again. "We have received more than 2,400 such letters in the first half of this year."

"How do you handle so many letters?" I asked.

"Our principle is to reply promptly," Deputy Director Wang said, "We always reply, sometimes even if they don't write to us." He took out a letter from this stack and showed it to me. It was from Hu Sanlin, a labor model from Beishe Village. Deputy Director Wang told me: Eight days ago, Hu Sanlin wrote to say that the cotton had aphids, and the farm immediately replied and told him how to control the cotton aphids. Today, Hu Sanlin wrote to say that using the method introduced by the farm, he had completely eliminated the cotton aphids. He is now telling this method to the masses in the whole village for everyone to use. The letter is very simple, but it fully demonstrates the farmers' trust in the farm and the farm's concern for the farmers.

The close relationship between the Wu Xiang State-Owned Farm and the farmers was established through unremitting efforts and overcoming many difficulties. In the first two years after the farm was established in 1949, the farm cadres did not understand production and always learned some production experience from experienced old farmers before returning to cultivate the farm's land and promote it to the masses. However, the farmers laughed as soon as they heard the propaganda: "What's there to say? I've grown more millet than you've ever seen!" Because they didn't understand agricultural science, in 1949 they even promoted the backward "wide row, large ridge, sparse sowing and sparse planting" as advanced experience. Later, although the cadres understood some of the principles of seed selection and pest and disease control, many farmers still refused to accept it:

"You have such good methods, but the grain you harvest on your farm isn't much more than what I harvest." Through the education of facts, the farm cadres gradually deeply realized the farm construction policy of "relying on work within the farm to carry out work outside the farm" stipulated by the Party and the People's Government, and strengthened the research and experiment work within the farm. In 1950, the farm's land achieved a yield that was 48% higher than that of the local farmers. The farmers then began to believe in the new agricultural technologies and knowledge disseminated by the farm. In 1951, the farm achieved another unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average yield of 325 jin per mu, which was 74% higher than the local farmers' average yield of 187 jin per mu. Many agricultural production cooperatives and model mutual aid groups achieved unprecedented harvests because they accepted the technical guidance of the farm. The corn of the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative created a record of 720 jin per mu; the sorghum of Wu Renhui in Chengguan District received 644 jin per mu. The farm cadres used these living examples to promote new technologies to the masses, and the effect was even greater. When the farmers talked about the farm, they gave a thumbs up and said, "When it comes to growing crops, the farm is like a god, whatever they say will happen." In the winter of that year, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government inspected the work of more than 100 state-owned farms in the province and awarded the Wu Xiang Farm a bright red flag with the words "Model of High-Yield Demonstration, Core of Technical Reform." Today, this red flag is not only hung on the wall of the farm's office, but also flutters in the hearts of the vast number of farmers in Wu Xiang County. The technical innovation movement in the countryside is surging forward.

Starting this year, the Wu Xiang State-Owned Farm, on the basis of last year, has launched a more planned high-yield movement within the farm and a technical reform movement outside the farm. In each district, a total of 25 technical transmission stations have been established, each station is responsible for five or six villages, and each village has organized a technical committee. The farm cadres regularly pass on new technologies to the transmission stations, the transmission stations then pass them on to the village technical committees, and the village technical committees then promote them to the farmers in their villages, forming a vast and powerful technical promotion network. The transmission staff are all farmers who are enthusiastic about agricultural technical reform. After receiving new technologies from the farm, they first implement them on their own land or in the cooperative, and then use facts to explain the benefits of the new technologies to the farmers, which is very persuasive to the farmers. This year, the farm called for the cultivation of fine varieties and the comparison test of various cultivation methods, so as to universally adopt fine varieties three years later and further promote the agricultural innovation movement. The farmers of the whole county enthusiastically responded to this call and demarcated three fine variety breeding areas, reserving more than 58,000 mu of seed fields. All 43 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 1,000 mutual aid groups in the county have established their own "small farms" to conduct comparative tests of various new and old cultivation techniques, with a total area of more than 2,400 mu.

Numbers often make people feel bored when reading them, but they mark the effectiveness of the hard work of cadres and transmitters and the progress of production technology in the vast countryside. In the first half of this year, more than 80,000 male and female farmers in the county received new agricultural knowledge; nearly 40,000 farmers and cadres conducted field visits and evaluations of fine varieties during the summer harvest, and selected more than 2.1 million jin of wheat seeds belonging to three fine varieties; this year, 460,000 mu of autumn fields in the county have reached 62 dan of base fertilizer per mu, and half of the cultivated land has been top-dressed once, twice, or three times; 387 canals have been opened, and 200 wells have been dug, turning 30,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields; all cultivated land has reached an average of 3.6 ploughings and 4 hoeings... These numbers make people see the prospect of a greater harvest.

On the day the enlarged conference of district and village cadres closed, Li Pengfei, the secretary of the county party committee, and Sun Ligong, the county magistrate, led more than 1,400 district and village cadres to visit the farm. The summer sun baked everyone's face and back, but people stood in front of the farm's lush crops for a long time, reluctant to leave. One said: "Ah! Look at the sorghum, the stalks are as thick as arms, and the ears are as big as heads." Another said: "The corn has two ears, and each ear is half a foot long." The third said: "The millet ears are like dog tails"...

A young farm cadre reported to everyone: "This is the farm's nine mu of high-yield land, three mu each of sorghum, millet, and corn. According to the current growth of the crops, millet can yield 1,200 jin per mu, sorghum can yield 1,300 jin per mu, and corn can yield 2,016 jin per mu." The visitors whispered in surprise.

The farm technician explained in detail to the visitors the entire cultivation process, sequence, and cultivation methods of these high-yield lands, and many people wrote them down in their notebooks. The explainer finally said: "This year, the average yield of the farm's land will be more than doubled compared to last year, from an average of 325 jin per mu last year to 776 jin per mu."

After the visit, Wang Jinyun, the director of the Yaoshanggou Agricultural Production Cooperative and a labor model of Shanxi Province, said to me: "I calculated that these nine mu of land on the farm can produce one hundred shi of grain [Note]. In the early years, people said 'It's hard to produce one hundred shi without planting one hundred mu,' but now, in the new China led by our Chairman Mao, you can produce one hundred shi in less than ten mu."

"Isn't your cooperative's high-yield corn also yielding 1,500 jin per mu? That's also ten shi per mu!" I said.

Hearing about his crops, Wang Jinyun smiled: "Not only our cooperative, but also many other cooperatives and mutual aid groups have high-yield land that yields ten shi per mu."

In July, at the county-wide wheat harvest competition, Wei Mingbiao, the director of the Zaoying Agricultural Production Cooperative, which created a new national high-yield record for dryland wheat with a harvest of 732 jin per mu, launched a patriotic high-yield competition for wheat to yield 1,000 jin per mu next year throughout the county. More than 1,400 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups participated in this competition. I think that with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, with the establishment and increase of collective farms and agricultural production cooperatives, with the rapid growth of the motherland's industry and its increasingly strengthened support for agriculture, with the promotion and dissemination of new agricultural technologies, it will not be long before the current movement of thousands of groups and tens of thousands of households, yielding 1,000 jin per mu, will become a movement of thousands of villages and tens of thousands of cooperatives, yielding one hundred shi in ten mu.

[Note] Corn yields 2,016 jin per mu, 3 mu totaling 6,048 jin, 43.2 shi at 140 jin per shi; sorghum yields 1,300 jin per mu, 3 mu totaling 3,900 jin, 27.86 shi at 140 jin per shi; millet yields 1,200 jin per mu, 3 mu totaling 3,600 jin, 27.7 shi at 130 jin per shi. The three items total 98.76 shi.

    九亩能收百石
    本报记者  田流
    在我看到过的国营农场中，武乡国营农场要算是最小的了。耕地统共六十九亩七分，还不如东北草原上一个普通农户的耕地多。全场职工，连场长带工人只有十四个。可是，经过调查，我发现这个国营农场的影响是非常大的：全县十五万农民，六十四万亩土地，都在它的直接影响和指导下进行生产。
    我访问这个农场的期间，武乡县正举行扩大的区村党、政干部会议。不论白天和夜晚，一到休会的时候，人们就一个接一个、一群又一群地涌到农场来了。他们有的向农场干部谈自己的生产情况，有的问一些耕作上的疑难问题，有的是来玩玩，转一转或坐一坐就走了。
    “真不凑巧，今天下午是大会休会时间，你的访问怕不能顺利进行了。”王副场长目送着刚走出门去的一个硕长身材的青年，抱歉地向我解释。这是我来农场访问的开头半点钟内王副场长送走的第四个客人。
    “他是谁？”我指一指刚才消失在门外的那个青年人。他来后没有说一句话，喝了杯水就走啦。
    “洞上村农业生产合作社社长。今年他们社有一块小麦在农场指导下得到每亩五百多斤的高额产量。”停了一会，王副场长又补充一句：“彼此熟识了，他们到了县里，有事没事总要到农场来转转。”
    我们谈起农场同农民的关系来。王副场长说：“你要了解这方面的情况容易，只要在咱这里坐上半天，就摸个七八了。”随后他拿给我厚厚的一叠信，足有一百多封：“这是最近三五天收到的农民来信，从这里面也可以看出些农场和农民的关系。”
    这些信都是用毛笔在粗糙的麻纸上写的，许多字歪歪扭扭地。我抽看的第一封信，是七区南沟村技术委员会主任郝来虎写来的。他报告了他们村夏锄进行的情况后说：“全村庄稼长的很好，棉花正打枒去顶，请将咱农场培养棉花的好法子来信说明。”第二封信是会同村女劳动模范王桂英写来的。她领导着全村妇女，在夏季生产中又作出了新的成绩。她写道：“三十五个妇女参加了麦子田间选种，十四个妇女正学习使用新式步犁耕麦地，陈银香、王桂莲等四个青年妇女已经学会了……。”
    “我们每天平均收到一二十封信。”王副场长利用最后一簇客人已去，新客人还没来的空隙，又同我谈起来。“今年上半年，我们已经收到二千四百多封这样的信了。”
    “怎样处理这许多信件呢？”我问。
    “我们的原则是及时答复”，王副场长说，“有来必往，有时不来也往。”他从这一叠信中找出一封给我看。这是北社村劳动模范胡三林来的。王副场长告诉我：八天以前胡三林来信说，棉花上生了蚜虫，农场当天就回信告诉他治棉蚜虫的方法。今天胡三林来信说，使用农场介绍的方法，他已经把棉蚜完全扑灭了。现正把这方法告诉给全村群众，都来使用。信写得很简单，但农民对农场的信赖，农场对农民的关怀，统统表现出来了。
    武乡国营农场和农民的亲密关系，是经过不懈的努力，克服了许多困难才建立起来的。一九四九年农场成立后的一两年内，农场干部不懂生产，总是先向有经验的老农学点生产经验，再回头来种农场的土地，向群众宣传。可是，农民们一听宣传就发笑：“那还用说？我种过的谷子，比你看见过的还多！”因为不懂农业科学，一九四九年还曾把落后的“宽行大垅、疏播稀植”当作先进经验，宣传了一通。后来干部们虽然懂得了些选种啦、防除虫病害啦的道理，但许多农民还是推三推四不肯接受：
    “有这么好的办法，可是你们农场收的粮食也不比我多多少啊”。经过事实的教育，农场干部逐渐深刻地体会了党和人民政府规定的“依托场内工作，进行场外工作”的农场建设方针，加强了场内的研究、试验工作。一九五○年，农场土地得到了比当地农民高出百分之四十八的产量。农民才开始相信农场传播的新的农业技术和知识。一九五一年，农场又得到空前的大丰收，每亩平均收获三百二十五斤，比当地农民每亩一百八十七斤的平均产量高出百分之七十四。许多农业生产合作社和模范互助组因为接受了农场的技术指导而得到空前的丰收。窑上沟农业生产合作社的玉茭，创造了每亩收七百二十斤的纪录；城关区武任会的高粱，每亩收到六百四十四斤。农场干部拿上这些活人真事向群众宣传新技术，效果就更大了。农民们谈起农场来，就竖起大拇指说：“论种庄稼，农场赛神仙，说个甚就成个甚。”这年冬天，山西省人民政府检查了全省百多个国营农场的工作后，奖给武乡农场一面鲜艳的红旗，旗上写着：“丰产示范的模范，技术改革的核心”。如今这面红旗不仅挂在农场办公室的墙壁上，也飘扬在武乡县广大农民的心中了。农村中的技术革新运动，汹涌地开展起来。
    今年开始，武乡国营农场在去年的基础上，展开了更有计划的场内丰产运动和场外的技术改革运动。在各区，共建立起二十五个技术传授站，每个站负责五、六个村，村村组织了技术委员会。农场干部定期把新技术传授给传授站，传授站又去传授给村技术委员会，村技术委员会再向本村农民推广，形成了广大有力的技术推广网。传授员都是热心农业技术改革的农民，他们得到农场的新技术后，先在自己的土地上或合作社里实行，然后用事实向农民说明新技术的好处，这对农民的说服力很大。今年农场号召培育优良品种，进行各种耕作方法的对比试验，以便三年后普遍采用良种，和进一步推进农业革新运动。全县农民热烈响应了这个号召，共划出三个优良品种繁殖区，留种田五万八千余亩。全县四十三个农业生产合作社和一千多互助组，都建立了自己的“小农场”，进行各种新旧耕作技术的对比试验，总面积达二千四百余亩。
    数目字常常使人读起来枯燥，但它却标志着干部和传授员们辛勤工作的成效和广大农村生产技术的前进。今年前半年，全县有八万多男女农民受到新的农业知识的教育；夏收时有近四万农民和干部，进行了田间参观和评选良种工作，选出属于三种优良品种的二百一十余万斤小麦种子；今年全县四十六万亩秋田，已经达到每亩施底肥六十二担，有半数耕地上了一次、二次、三次的追肥；开渠三百八十七条，打井二百眼，使三万亩旱地变为水田；全部耕地平均达到耕三点六遍、锄四遍……这些数目字使人看到了更大丰收的前景。
    扩大的区村干部会议闭幕的那天，县委书记李鹏飞同志和县长孙立功同志领着一千四百多区村干部到农场参观。夏日的太阳烤得每个人的脸上、背上都淌着汗，可是人们都久久地站在农场繁茂的庄稼前，舍不得离去。这个说：“呀！看那高粱，杆子有胳臂粗，穗子有脑袋大。”那个说：“玉茭都长两穗，穗穗都是尺半长。”第三个说：“谷穗就像狗尾巴”……
    一个年青的农场干部向大家报告：“这是农场九亩丰产地，高粱、谷子、玉茭，每样三亩。按现在庄稼的生育状况，谷子一亩能收一千二百斤，高粱一亩能收一千三百斤，玉茭一亩能收二千零一十六斤。”参观的人们发出一阵惊喜的细语。
    农场的技术员详细给参观的人们解释这些丰产地的全部耕作过程、顺序和耕作方法，不少人把它记入自己的小本本上。讲解者最后说：“今年农场的土地，平均产量要比去年提高一倍多，要由去年的每亩平均三百二十五斤提高到七百七十六斤。”
    参观过后，窑上沟农业生产合作社社长、山西省劳动模范王锦云同志向我说：“我算了一下，农场这九亩地能打一百石粮〔注〕。早年人说‘不种百亩难打百石’，如今在咱毛主席领导的新中国，不到十亩就能打百石了。”
    “你们合作社的丰产玉茭，不也是一亩收一千五百斤么？也是一亩十石啦！”我说。
    听到说他的庄稼，王锦云笑起来了：“不光我们社，别的社和互助组也有不少一亩十石的丰产地呢。”
    七月间，在全县麦收的评比大会上，创造了全国旱地小麦丰产新纪录的、每亩收获七百三十二斤的枣堙农业生产合作社社长魏明标向全县发起明年小麦一亩千斤的爱国丰产竞赛，一千四百多个农业生产合作社和互助组参加了这个竞赛。我想，随着互助合作运动的开展，随着集体农庄和农业生产合作社的建立和增多，随着祖国工业的飞速增涨和日益加强着的对农业的支援，随着新的农业技术的推广和传播，用不了很久，现今开展的千组万户、一亩千斤运动，就会变成千庄万社、十亩百石的运动了。
    〔注〕每亩玉茭产二○一六斤，三亩计六○四八斤，每石一四○斤计四三·二石；每亩高粱产一三○○斤，三亩计三九○○斤，每石一四○斤，计二七·八六石；每亩谷子产一二○○斤，三亩计三六○○斤，每石一三○斤，计二七·七石。三项共计九八·七六石。
