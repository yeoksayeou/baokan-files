Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 29th (TASS): Pravda published a talk by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, with Pravda's Beijing correspondent, Jelyusin, on the great significance of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people have learned from their historical experience the importance and significance of the struggle for peace and against aggression. For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people have been engaged in a heroic struggle against foreign capitalists' aggression against their territory and plunder of their wealth. For nearly thirty years, this struggle has been carried out under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, culminating in the historic victory of the Chinese people. A path of great creative construction has been opened up before the Chinese people. This construction can only develop smoothly if peace is maintained.

    Guo Moruo said: The Chinese people love peace. That is why, when the American imperialists launched aggression in Korea and occupied our Taiwan, when the flames of war were already approaching the borders of our motherland, the people of the whole country took up arms to resist the aggressors. After the failure of the American aggressors in Korea, they did not hesitate to use bacteriological weapons to intimidate the Korean and Chinese people, but the Chinese and Korean people cannot be intimidated. Their resistance to American aggression is increasing day by day.

    Guo Moruo went on to say that the proposal to convene the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was heartily supported by people from all walks of life in China. The people of many countries in Asia and the Pacific have also expressed their welcome to the decision to convene the peace conference, which proves that the people of all countries want peace. Although the opinions of the various representatives are not entirely the same, they unanimously agree with the spirit of the declaration of the preparatory meeting of the peace conference. At this meeting, they will have the opportunity to gather together and freely exchange opinions, thereby breaking the curtain that the imperialists want to use to isolate the people of various countries. This will greatly promote world peace. Guo Moruo said: The people of Asia and the Pacific region have all suffered from Japanese aggression, and they have a common desire to prevent the revival of Japanese militarism. All countries unanimously hope to end the plundering war launched by the American imperialists in Korea as soon as possible. It is also necessary for all countries to establish and consolidate the economic and cultural relations that the imperialists are trying to undermine.

    Guo Moruo concluded by saying that the Chinese people pay tribute to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and wish the conference success. The Chinese people hope that the conference will work in the spirit of mutual understanding expressed in the declaration of the preparatory meeting. The Chinese people guarantee that they will faithfully fulfill all the decisions of the conference.

    郭沫若对真理报记者谈和平会议的意义
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：真理报刊载中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若对真理报驻北京记者杰柳辛发表的谈话，论述亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重大意义。
    郭沫若说：中国人民从他们的历史经验中了解到争取和平、反对侵略的斗争的重要性与意义。百余年来，中国人民一直在进行反对外国资本家侵略国土、掠夺财富的英勇斗争。近三十年来，这个斗争是在中国共产党的领导下进行的，并以中国人民的历史性胜利为其顶点。中国人民的面前已展现了伟大的创造性建设的道路。这个建设只有在和平得以保持的情况下才有可能顺利发展。
    郭沫若说：中国人民是热爱和平的。这就是当美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动侵略并占领我们的台湾的时候，当战火已经逼近我们祖国边境的时候，全国人民为什么拿起武器反抗侵略者的原因。美国侵略者在朝鲜失败后，为了恫吓朝鲜与中国人民，竟不惜使用细菌武器，但是，中国和朝鲜人民是吓不倒的。他们对美国侵略的抵抗正在日益加强。
    郭沫若接着说，召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的建议受到中国各阶层人民的衷心拥护。亚洲和太平洋许多国家的人民也都表示欢迎召开和平会议的决定，这证明各国人民都是希望和平的。尽管各个代表的意见不尽相同，但他们仍一致同意和平会议筹备会议的宣言的精神。在这次会议上，他们将有机会共聚一堂，自由地交换意见，从而打破帝国主义者要想用来隔绝各国人民的帷幕。这将大大促进全世界的和平。郭沫若说：亚洲和太平洋区域的人民都曾身受日本侵略之害，他们有一个共同的愿望——防止日本军国主义复活。各国人民都一致希望尽快结束美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动的掠夺战争。各国也有必要建立和巩固帝国主义者力图加以破坏的经济和文化关系。
    郭沫若最后说，中国人民向亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议致敬。并祝会议成功。中国人民希望会议本着筹备会议宣言中所表达的互谅的精神进行工作。中国人民保证他们将忠实地履行会议的一切决定。
