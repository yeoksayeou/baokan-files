    Cultural Great Advance
    By Peng Bin and Sun Hanchun
    13. During the intensive study of new characters, Zhou Dabao created a method: to put a dot on the characters he could pronounce and explain, like a wounded enemy; to put a circle on the characters he could read without looking at the phonetic symbols, like a captured enemy. He ignored the captured ones and concentrated on capturing the wounded ones. After reviewing five or six times, I completed the task of learning three hundred characters when clearing the battlefield in the evening.
    14. During this intensive study of new characters, we discovered an ideological problem with Li Yushan. Originally, when studying in the group, he always felt that everyone was learning too slowly and not enjoyably enough. During the review, he hid under a tree and worked on his own, resulting in remembering this and forgetting that. In the afternoon, he hurried back to the group, and with the help of others, he managed to review the several new characters.
    15. The intensive study of new characters lasted for eight full days, and all two thousand three hundred and sixty-six characters were taught. After the test, my scores, Li Yushan's, and Wang Xuewen's were the highest, with two thousand three hundred and sixty-six characters. Zhou Dabao was slightly behind during the intensive study, but with the help of the three of us, Zhou Dabao caught up, and his test score was two thousand three hundred and twenty-seven characters.

    文化大进军

    十三、在突击生字中，周大保创造了一个办法，就是在能拼能讲的字上，画上个点儿，好比是被打伤的敌人；把不看注音符号就会念的字，画上个圈儿，好比是被俘的敌人。被俘的不管，集中力量，捉负伤的，这样复习五六次，晚上清查战果时，三百字的任务我全部完成了。
    十四、这次突击生字时，发现了李玉山一个思想毛病。原先在小组上学习，他总嫌大家学得慢，不过瘾（一ㄣ），复习时他就躲到树下单人干起来了，结果记住这个，忘了那个。下午才赶紧回到了小组，经过人家的帮助，才把几个生字复习完。
    十五、突击生字整整搞了八天，两千三百六十六个字都教完了，经过测验，我和李玉山，王学文的成绩最高，是两千三百六十六字。周大保突击生字时稍差，经过我们三人的帮助，周大保也赶上来了，测验的成绩是二千三百二十七个字。
