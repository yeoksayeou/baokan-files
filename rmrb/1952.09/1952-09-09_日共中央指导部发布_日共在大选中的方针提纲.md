Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 7th: "Akahata" published the outline of the policies that the Japanese Communist Party Central Guidance Department issued regarding the principles that the Communist Party should follow in the upcoming Diet elections.

　　The outline points out that the sudden dissolution of the Diet was at the instigation of the US imperialists. The US imperialists want to catch the opposition parties off guard, leaving them no time to prepare for the election; they want to strangle the people's struggle for peace and independence; they also want to use bribery and various means of persecution to re-establish the corrupt royal bureaucracy and support the traitorous bureaucratic forces. All of this shows that, with the people's dissatisfaction and opposition growing, the US reactionaries' war preparations policy has been completely defeated, and therefore the traitorous Liberal Party has reached the brink of collapse.

　　The outline writes: The upcoming election will be a serious struggle. If we are defeated in this general election, the next Diet will become a Diet that approves of rearmament, constitutional revision, and making the Japanese people cannon fodder. If we are victorious, the next Diet will become a Diet that approves of the people of the whole country rising up against the occupying regime of the US reactionaries, becoming a vast battlefield of revolutionary struggle.

　　The outline puts forward a task to the Communist Party members, to make the national liberation democratic united front election platform put forward by the Communist Party become the election platform of the people of the whole country.

　　The success of this work will determine the development of the national liberation democratic united front during the election period. Communist Party members should adopt the tactics of the united front, rely on the alliance of workers and peasants, and pay attention to their revolutionary demands.

　　The outline points out: All Communist Party members face the following main tasks in this election:

　　(1) Fight for the election of candidates nominated by the national united front; unite all democratic parties, groups, and patriots who hope to defeat the Liberal Party, and in this regard, retain the freedom of action and mutual criticism of all parties participating in the election.

　　(2) Struggle against the policies that divide the people, and severely criticize the divisive policies of the Socialist Party.

　　(3) The united front election platform put forward by the Communist Party should serve as the foundation for the united front and the coalition government.

　　(4) We must defeat the Liberal Party with all our strength and make all honest Liberal Party members leave the party.

　　(5) Organize people's committees to expose election conspiracies, defend the party, and prevent provocations, attacks, and assassinations against its candidates from succeeding; at the same time, we must raise vigilance regarding the situation within the party.

　　(6) All party members must participate in the election with this firm belief: if the people of the whole country cannot unite, national liberation cannot be achieved; if the Communist Party cannot achieve victory, the unity of the people of the whole country cannot be achieved.

　　The outline then roughly outlines the main propaganda tasks during the election period, namely, listing specific facts to expose the actions of the Liberal Party, explaining the actual situation in Japan, widely publicizing the party's new program, and making the people of the whole country aware of the necessity of abolishing the separate peace treaty and all related agreements. The outline writes: "It is necessary to especially emphasize explaining the actual situation of peaceful countries—first of all the Soviet Union and China—and their policies of economic and social development."

    日共中央指导部发布
    日共在大选中的方针提纲
　　【新华社八日讯】塔斯社东京七日讯：“赤旗报”刊载了日本共产党中央指导部发布的关于共产党在即将到来的国会选举中应当遵循的方针的提纲。
　　提纲指出，突然解散国会是出于美帝国主义者的指使。美帝国主义者想借此把反对党派弄得措手不及，没有工夫进行竞选准备；他们想扼杀人民争取和平与独立的斗争；他们还想用行贿手段和各种迫害手段来重新建立腐朽的皇室官僚制度，扶植卖国的官僚势力。这种种情况都说明，在人民的不满与反对情绪日益增长的情况下，美国反动派的备战政策已遭到彻底的失败，因此卖国的自由党已走到土崩瓦解的边缘。
　　提纲写道：即将到来的选举将是一场严重的斗争。如果我们在这次大选中被击败，下届国会将会成为赞成重新武装、修改宪法和使日本人民当炮灰的国会。如果我们得到胜利，下届国会就会成为赞成全国人民起来反对美国反动派的占领政权的国会，变成革命斗争的广大战场。
　　提纲向共产党员提出一项任务，要使共产党提出的民族解放民主统一战线竞选纲领成为全国人民的竞选纲领。
　　这种工作的成功将决定竞选期间民族解放民主统一战线的发展。共产党员应当采取统一战线的策略，依靠工人与农民的联盟，重视他们的革命要求。
    提纲指出：全体共产党员在这次竞选中面临着以下几项主要任务：
    （一）为民族统一战线提名的候选人当选而斗争；团结希望击败自由党的一切民主党派、团体和爱国者，在这方面要保留参加竞选的一切党派的行动自由和相互批评的权利。
    （二）对使国民分裂的政策进行斗争，严厉指责社会党的分裂政策。
    （三）共产党提出的统一战线竞选纲领应当作为统一战线和联合政府的基础。
    （四）必须用一切力量击败自由党，使一切正直的自由党员脱党。
    （五）组织人民委员会来揭露选举阴谋，保卫党，使对它的候选人进行的挑衅、攻击和暗算不能得逞；同时必须对党内情况提高警觉。
    （六）全体党员在参加选举过程中必须怀着这样一个坚定的信念：如果全国人民不能团结一致，民族解放就不能实现；如果共产党不能得到胜利，全国人民的团结就不能实现。
    提纲接着概略地指出竞选期间的主要宣传任务，即列举具体事实来揭露自由党的行径，说明日本的实际情况，广泛宣传党的新纲领，使全国人民认识废除单独和约和一切有关的协定的必要性。提纲写道：“必须特别强调解释和平国家——首先是苏联和中国——的实际情况以及它们的经济与社会发展的政策。”
