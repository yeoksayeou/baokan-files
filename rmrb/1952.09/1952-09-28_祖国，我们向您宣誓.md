    Motherland, We Pledge to You
    Volunteer Army Returning Representatives Fang Lidong, Qu Yune, Li Boyun
    When the news that we were returning to Korea from the motherland spread in the army, comrades were eager to know about the motherland with incomparable cordiality. Everyone wanted to hear the representatives' report immediately, and every unit wanted to invite the representatives to give a report to them first.

    The report meetings of various units were mostly held in the verdant jungle. A portrait of Chairman Mao was hung on the tree trunk, and slogans of various colors were pasted around. The comrades put on brand-new military uniforms and wore gleaming Korean War memorial medals on their chests. A certain regiment of the guard regiment ran more than thirty miles in the pouring rain to listen to the report, and persisted for more than eight hours without even eating lunch. The soldiers said: "Listening to the news of the motherland, we are not hungry even without eating." Several comrades who were too sick to get out of bed heard that the representatives had returned and asked to be carried to the meeting place on stretchers to listen to the report. There were also many comrades who listened several times in a row. They said, "Listening to Chairman Mao's words, listening to the victorious news of the motherland's construction, we will never tire of listening a hundred times."

    In each meeting, we first told everyone the news of seeing Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's good health. This news has infinite power, and each time it aroused lasting applause and cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao." These voices shook the entire valley, often interrupting our speeches. Because everyone knows that Chairman Mao's good health is our greatest happiness and our guarantee of eternal victory.

    In the report, we conveyed in detail the entrustment of the people of the motherland to us and the great victory of the motherland's construction in the past two years. This news also encouraged our comrades. The comrades waved their fists and shouted: "Thank the people of the motherland for their full support to us, and resolutely defend our great motherland." During the report, we recited a poem describing the workers and peasants of the motherland increasing production to support the front line with a high degree of selfless spirit:

    A drop of oil, a thread of thread,
    All are our blood and sweat;
    Save a little is a little,
    Strike US imperialism and aid North Korea.

    A piece of steel, a piece of iron,
    It takes effort to manufacture;
    Save an inch is an inch,
    Increase wealth and aid the front.

    After listening to this poem, many comrades said: We deeply realize that every bullet we use on the front line, every grain of food we eat, is permeated with the blood and sweat of the working people of the motherland. We must further improve the concept of cherishing materials and saving materials. The comrades said one after another: Don't waste a bullet, don't lose a grain of food, and strike the American aggressors more heavily.

    The comrades all believe that it is glorious to be a volunteer soldier, but we feel even more glorious to be a people's meritorious volunteer soldier. When we talked about how the people of the motherland like to ask "Comrade, have you made meritorious service in Korea?" and how the children of the motherland also like to listen to the heroic and meritorious volunteer soldiers talk about their deeds of killing the enemy, the comrades were very excited. Some comrades even dreamed about how to make meritorious service for the people. In the communist party branches, the communist youth league branches, and the offices of the chiefs of each unit, on the night after listening to the report, they were filled with soldiers' letters of determination and plans for making meritorious service. The comrades who had made meritorious service said that they would make greater meritorious service in the future, and the comrades who had not made meritorious service were a hundred times confident that they would strive to make meritorious service.

    Now, the report work of our division has been initially completed. More than 85% of the volunteer soldiers have heard the report. Through this visit to the country and the report work back to the Korean front, we have further seen the greatness of the motherland and more deeply realized that our volunteer soldiers are becoming stronger and stronger. We deeply feel that every inch of land in our motherland is lovely and must not be invaded by anyone, and we also have the strength not to allow the enemy to invade. In order to defend our motherland to better carry out construction, for the people of our motherland to live more happily, for the independence and freedom of our neighboring country Korea, and for the lasting peace of the world, motherland, we pledge to you: We will always stand on the forefront of defending you.

    祖国，我们向您宣誓
    志愿军归国代表  方立栋、曲云娥、李伯芸
    当我们从祖国回到朝鲜的消息在部队里传开的时候，同志们都以无比亲切的心情渴望知道祖国的消息，每个人都想能够马上听到代表的报告，每一个单位都想请代表们先到他们那里去作传达报告。
    各单位的传达报告大会大部分都是在碧绿的丛林中举行的。树干上挂着毛主席像，周围贴着各种颜色的标语，同志们都穿上崭新的军服，胸前佩着金光夺目的抗美援朝纪念章。某部警卫团为了听报告，冒着大雨跑了三十多里路，连午饭也不吃，一直坚持了八个多小时。战士们说：“听祖国的消息，不吃饭也不饿。”有几位同志病得不能起床，听说代表回来了，要求用担架把他们抬到会场来听报告。还有不少的同志连续听了好几次，他们说：“听毛主席的话，听祖国建设的胜利消息，听一百次也不厌。”
    在每次会上传达的时候，我们都把见到毛主席和毛主席身体健康的消息首先告诉大家。这个消息有无穷的力量，每次都引起经久不息的掌声和“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声。这些声音震动着整个山谷，常常打断我们的讲话。因为大家知道：毛主席的身体健康，就是我们最大的幸福，就是我们永远胜利的保证。
    我们在报告中，详细地传达了祖国人民对我们的嘱托和祖国两年多建设的伟大胜利。这些消息也同样地鼓舞我们的同志们。同志们挥动着拳头高喊：“感谢祖国人民对我们的全力支援，坚决保卫我们伟大的祖国。”报告时，我们朗诵了描写祖国的工人兄弟和农民兄弟以高度忘我精神增加生产支援前线的一首诗：
    一滴油，一丝线，
    全是咱们的血和汗；
    节省一点是一点，
    打击美帝援朝鲜。
    一块钢，一块铁，
    制造出来费力量；
    节省一寸是一寸，
    增加财富援前方。
    听了这首诗以后，许多同志说：我们深深地体会到我们在前线所用的每一颗子弹，所吃的每一颗粮食，都渗透着祖国劳动人民的血汗，我们要更加提高爱护物资节约物资的观念。同志们纷纷表示：不浪费一颗弹，不损失一粒粮，更沉重地打击美国侵略者。
    同志们都认为做一个志愿军是光荣的，但我们更感到做一个志愿军的人民功臣更是无比的光荣。当我们说到祖国人民喜欢问“同志，你在朝鲜立过功吧？”以及祖国的小朋友们也最喜欢听志愿军的英雄、功臣讲自己的杀敌事迹时，同志们的心可激动得厉害啦。有的同志连做梦也在想应该怎样为人民立功。每个单位的共产党支部、青年团支部和首长的办公室里，在听了报告的当夜，都堆满了战士的决心书和立功计划。立过功的同志表示今后要立更大的功，没立过功的信心百倍地一定要争取立功。
    现在，我们分部的传达报告工作已经初步结束。百分之八十五以上的志愿军同志都听到了报告。通过这次归国访问以及回到朝鲜前线的报告工作，我们进一步看到了祖国的伟大，更深刻地体会到了我们志愿军的愈战愈强。我们深深地感觉到：我们祖国的每一寸土地都是可爱的，绝不能让任何人侵犯，也有力量不让敌人进犯。为了保卫我们祖国更好地进行建设，为了我们祖国人民更幸福地生活，为了我们邻邦朝鲜的独立自由，为了世界的持久和平，祖国，我们向您宣誓：我们永远站在保卫您的最前线。
