A Good Example of National Regional Autonomy
Peng Zemin, Head of the Central Visiting Group; Sa Kongliao, Deputy Head; Aiesha
The Central Visiting Group was dispatched to represent the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao to visit ethnic minorities in Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Northeast China, convey the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao's concern for ethnic minorities, and listen to the opinions, wishes, and demands of ethnic minorities in various regions. We departed on July 9th and have been working for more than two months, half of which was spent visiting Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan. Through this visit, we have gained a deeper understanding of the ethnic work in the Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan regions. In particular, understanding the actual situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has given us a prominent and profound impression, enhancing our understanding of Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy.
We believe that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has indeed become a good example of national regional autonomy in the country.
In the past five years, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has implemented Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy, widely united people of all ethnic groups and social strata, carried out united front work, and steadily carried out political power construction. Land reform was carried out in agricultural areas, and feudal privileges were abolished in pastoral areas, thus consolidating and developing new ethnic relations.
In terms of political power construction, village (gacha) elections and political construction were widely carried out in the eastern Inner Mongolia region from the winter of 1949 and the spring of 1950, enabling people of all ethnic groups to elect people they trust to participate in the government according to their own will. Since 1950, people's representative conferences have been held four to seven times in 31 banners, counties, and cities. Ethnic minorities within the autonomous region, such as the Oroqen people's residential areas, established the Oroqen Autonomous Banner People's Government in November 1951. Other ethnic minority residential areas that can establish a level of administrative unit are now preparing to gradually implement regional autonomy in accordance with the "Outline of the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China." These efforts to ensure that all ethnic minorities enjoy equal rights have received extremely good responses among the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. During our visit, we often heard the phrase: "We never dreamed in the past that we would be able to enjoy the rights we enjoy in politics today." Especially women, when telling us that they enjoy equal rights, often shed tears of joy.
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been able to combine the characteristics of Inner Mongolia and correctly formulate and implement plans in carrying out land reform in agricultural areas and abolishing feudal privileges in pastoral areas. For example, in land reform, the unity of Mongolian and Han poor people was achieved through the joint struggle against Han landlords; when distributing the fruits of victory, special consideration was given to the Mongolian people; this greatly improved the class consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups and promoted the unity of the Mongolian and Han peoples. For example, when abolishing feudal privileges in pastoral areas, the policy of no struggle, no division, free grazing, and increasing and protecting livestock was adhered to, eliminating the concerns of the herdowners and enabling animal husbandry to achieve normal development. The correctness of these policies has also been proven by facts during our visit. In many rural areas of Inner Mongolia, there are now permanent mutual aid teams with close cooperation between Mongolian and Han people that have achieved great success. In many sumu (districts) or gacha (villages) in pastoral areas, the herdowners we met all told us that they had been worried about being struggled against and divided in the past. After participating in people's representative conferences, they understood the government's policy of no struggle and no division, and they had the confidence to develop animal husbandry. Now they are striving for greater development.
In carrying out various production and construction undertakings, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have made great achievements under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. In terms of agricultural production, the policy of "organizing mutual assistance and cooperation" has been consistently implemented, and measures such as advocating intensive cultivation, fertilization, seed selection, flood control, drought resistance, issuing agricultural loans, and preventing pests and diseases have been taken, so that the total grain output has exceeded the pre-liberation level. In terms of animal husbandry production, the erroneous ideas of backward animal husbandry and attaching importance to agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry have been criticized. Three fights (fighting wolves, mowing grass, and digging wells) and two constructions (building sheds and building corrals) have been advocated, livestock epidemic prevention has been promoted, breeding livestock has been regulated, and livestock loans have been issued, so that the number of various livestock in Inner Mongolia has increased nearly doubled compared with the time of liberation. At the same time, in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the practice of unrestricted reclamation that damaged pastures was opposed, and the policy of "prohibiting reclamation and protecting pastures" was implemented. Mongolian and Han herdsmen and farmers were called upon to help each other in production and seek common development. Starting from the principle of developing production, the contradiction between farmland and pastures in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas was resolved through democratic consultation, which not only promoted the development of agricultural and pastoral economy but also strengthened the unity of Mongolian and Han people. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government's correct leadership in various production measures has been universally praised by the people of Inner Mongolia during our visit. Whether Mongolian or Han farmers and herdsmen, everyone likes to say: "In the past, our parents did not care for us as much as the People's Government does today." Therefore, they all assured us that they will be more actively responding to all the calls of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao in the future and strive to complete all the tasks assigned by the People's Government.
In addition, in terms of trade cooperation, Inner Mongolia vigorously built and developed state-owned trade and widely organized cooperatives. In terms of business, the policy of serving the development of agricultural and pastoral production was implemented, rapidly changing the historically serious unequal exchange, narrowing the scissors difference between the prices of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral products, and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. During our visit, we discovered that Mongolian farmers and herdsmen called cooperatives "Ulanhu's business" and developed the habit of going to "Ulanhu's business" to buy and sell things. In terms of cultural undertakings, Inner Mongolia criticized the tendency to ignore ethnic languages and scripts and ethnic forms, so that Mongolian culture has greatly developed. The number of students in schools is now two to eight times higher than in the past. During our visit, when visiting schools, teachers and students in various schools universally had the requirement of "further improving the culture of the people of Inner Mongolia on the basis of popularization." In terms of health undertakings, Inner Mongolia has widely carried out movements such as epidemic prevention and expulsion of syphilis, so that the population of ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia has not only stopped declining but has also gradually increased. During our visit, women constantly held up their own fat babies to show us, saying, "This is Chairman Mao's gift to my child!"
All the above-mentioned achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region not only make the people in ethnic minority areas in the country want to learn from Inner Mongolia but have also attracted the attention of international friends. Mrs. Felton of the United Kingdom, who won the Stalin Peace Prize, recently visited Ulanhot City. When leaving, she said that she had a very deep impression of the achievements in various aspects of Inner Mongolia.
After this visit, all the comrades of the Central Visiting Group unanimously believed that, based on the existing achievements and continued efforts, the great development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the future can be predicted.

    民族区域自治的良好榜样
    中央访问团团长　彭泽民　副团长　萨空了　阿艾沙
    中央访问团奉派代表中央人民政府毛主席访问内蒙古、绥远和东北各地少数民族，传达中央人民政府毛主席对少数民族的关怀，并听取各地少数民族的意见、愿望和要求。我们自七月九日出发，到现在已工作了两个多月，其中有二分之一的时间是在内蒙古和绥远地区访问。经过这一次访问，我们对蒙绥地区的民族工作有了较深刻的体会。特别是从内蒙古自治区的实际情况了解中，使我们得到突出而深刻的印象，提高了我们对毛主席伟大民族政策的认识。
    我们认为，内蒙古自治区确确实实已经成为全国少数民族区域自治的良好榜样了。
    五年来，内蒙古自治区人民政府贯彻执行了毛主席的伟大民族政策，广泛地团结了各民族各阶层人民，进行了统一战线工作，稳步地进行了政权建设。在农业区进行了土地改革，在牧业区废除了封建特权，因而巩固与发展了新的民族关系。
    在政权建设上，内蒙古东部地区自一九四九年冬及一九五零年春普遍进行了村（嘎查）的选举和建政工作，使各民族人民都根据自己的意志选出了自己信仰的人参加政权，并自一九五零年起，三十一个旗、县、市都普遍召开过四至七次的人民代表会议。自治区内的少数民族，如鄂伦春族聚居地区，已在一九五一年十一月成立了鄂伦春族自治区旗人民政府。其他少数民族的聚居地区，能建立起一级行政单位的，现也都在准备按照“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”逐步地实行区域自治。这种种保障各少数民族都享有平等权利的努力，已在内蒙古各族人民中获得极良好的反应。在我们访问过程中，常常听到一句话：“我们在过去梦也梦不到在政治上能享受到今日所享受的权利”。尤其是妇女，在向我们述说他们享有了平等权利的时候，常常喜欢得流下泪来。
    内蒙古自治区在进行农业区的土地改革，和牧业区的废除封建特权上，都能结合着内蒙古的特点，正确地制定执行方案。例如，在土地改革中，通过团结蒙汉族贫苦人民，共同斗争汉族地主；分果实时，特别照顾蒙族人民；这样，大大提高了各族人民的阶级觉悟，促进了蒙汉族人民的团结。又如在牧业区废除封建特权时，坚持不斗不分、自由放牧、增畜保畜的政策，扫除了牧主的顾虑，使畜牧业获得了正常的发展。这些政策的正确性，在我们访问中也得到了事实的证明。在内蒙古许多农村里，现在都有蒙汉族人民亲密合作的很有成绩的常年互助组。在牧区的许多苏木（区）或嘎查（村）中，我们遇到的牧主，都告诉我们，他们过去曾经有过怕斗怕分的顾虑，经过参加人民代表会议等，了解了政府的不斗不分的政策，才有了发展畜牧业的信心，现在他们正在努力追求更大的发展。
    在进行各项生产建设事业上，内蒙古自治区各族人民在共产党和人民政府领导下，已经取得了极大的成绩。在农业生产方面，一贯地贯彻了“组织起来互助合作”的方针，采取了提倡精耕细作、施肥、选种、防洪、抗旱、发放农业贷款、防止病虫害等措施，使粮食总产量已超过解放前的水平。在畜牧业生产方面，批判了畜牧落后论和重农轻牧等错误思想，提倡三打（打狼、打草、打井）两搭（搭棚、搭圈）、推行牲畜防疫，调剂种畜，发放畜牧贷款，使内蒙古各种牲畜较解放时增加了将近一倍。同时，在半农半牧区，反对了无限制开荒因而破坏牧场的作法，实行了“禁止开荒，保护牧场”的政策，号召蒙汉族牧民、农民在生产上互助，共谋发展。从发展生产的原则出发，以民主协商办法解决了半农半牧区农田与牧场的矛盾，这样，不仅推进了农牧经济的发展，还加强了蒙汉族人民的团结。内蒙古自治区人民政府正确领导各项生产的措施，在我们访问中听到了内蒙古人民普遍的歌颂。不论蒙汉族农民、牧民，大家都喜欢说：“过去我们的父母，也没有今天人民政府这样的关心我们。”因而，他们都向我们保证：今后一定要更加积极地响应中央人民政府毛主席的一切号召，努力完成人民政府交给的一切任务。
    此外，在贸易合作方面，内蒙古大力建设和发展了国营贸易，并普遍地组织了合作社。在业务上，贯彻了为农牧业生产发展而服务的方针，迅速地改变了历史上严重的不等价交换，缩小了工、农、牧产品价格的剪刀差，促进了城乡物资交流。我们在访问中，发见蒙族农牧民把合作社叫作“乌兰夫的买卖”，并养成了买卖东西都一定到“乌兰夫的买卖”那里去的习惯。在文化事业上，内蒙古批判忽视民族语言文字，忽视民族形式的偏向，因而使蒙族文化有了很大的发展。现在学校中学生的人数较诸过去，有的已增加两倍，乃至七、八倍。我们在访问中，参观学校时，各校师生普遍地有了“把内蒙古人民的文化在普及的基础上进一步提高”的要求。在卫生事业方面，内蒙古广泛地开展了防疫、驱逐梅毒等运动，使内蒙古民族的人口，不仅停止了下降，且已转为逐渐上升。我们访问途中，不断地有妇女举着她们自己的肥胖婴儿给我们看，说“这是毛主席给我的孩子！”
    上述内蒙古自治区的一切成就，不仅使国内各少数民族聚居区的人民要向内蒙古学习，且已引起了国际友人的注意。得过斯大林和平奖金的英国费尔顿夫人，最近就到过乌兰浩特市参观，在离开时，她说：对内蒙古各方面的成绩，获得了极深刻的印象。
    经过这次访问，中央访问团全体同志都一致相信，在这已有成就的基础上，继续努力，内蒙古自治区今后的伟大发展，是可以预断的。
