The carpentry workshop of the Beijing Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant was originally a backward link in the plant's production. However, after studying the advanced experience of Xie Wanfu's assembly line work method, it has become an advanced unit in production. Since the plant launched the Red Flag competition on July 1st, the carpentry workshop has completed 126.5% of its work tasks in half a month due to the comprehensive promotion of advanced working methods, and the entire team has won the "Full House Red" three times. From late June to early July, workers put forward forty-six tips in half a month. How did this team achieve these results?

    Breaking Through the Thinking of Middle and Lower-Level Leaders
    Laying the Foundation for Comprehensive Promotion of Work

    After the leading cadres promptly summarized the experience of the assembly line method used in the overhaul team's car panel installation, they helped the carpentry workshop to promote Xie Wanfu's assembly line method. In order to vigorously promote this advanced working method, the entire team established a core group, which included the team leader, the union group leader, the production group leader, and technicians forming a technical research group. They grasped this leading core and started by opening up the minds of leaders such as the team leader and group leaders, organizing them to study and research this working method. At the beginning, everyone had different understandings of this advanced working method. Some said, "Our current division into nine groups is already a specialized assembly line method." Some said, "There is no need to divide the work; as long as everyone is skilled, the efficiency will be about the same." Others said, "If one person only does one job, there will be so much work that we won't have enough people; we need to add more people." In order to make everyone realize the superiority of Xie Wanfu's assembly line method and the necessity for the carpentry workshop to learn this working method, under the active leadership of the team leader, they led everyone in a deep and specific analysis of the carpentry workshop's production situation. After more than a week of analysis and research, they found that there were many shortcomings in the carpentry workshop's work. For example, there was only division of labor between groups, but no division of labor within groups. Moreover, the division of labor between groups was not clear, and there was not enough connection between the groups, which often led to work stoppages waiting for materials. For example, the material collection group had fewer people and could not collect materials in time, which affected the work of other groups, so other groups collected materials themselves. Everyone, eager to complete their own tasks, rushed to cut materials and grab tools such as electric saws and electric planers, so there were not enough tools, and accidents of electric planers injuring hands often occurred. There was no one in the night shift material collection group, and the machines could only run for eight hours a day. After studying these shortcomings, everyone realized that only by learning Xie Wanfu's assembly line method well can the production efficiency of the carpentry workshop be improved. The middle-level leaders achieved a consensus in their thinking, which laid a good foundation for the promotion of advanced experience in the entire team.

    Focus on Experiments, Gain Experience

    Although the middle-level cadres' thinking was clear, when this advanced working method was promoted to the team, the workers' thinking was not yet clear. Some workers said, "The assembly line method promoted by the overhaul team, our team has already implemented it, there is nothing great about it." Some workers believed, "Xie Wanfu's work efficiency is so high, it's too mysterious and not necessarily reliable." Some workers believed, "Xie Wanfu's method is relatively simple and only suitable for making doors and windows, but we are working on trams, and the work is numerous and complicated, I am afraid it will not work." The most common thought among the masses was: "Xie Wanfu's method is good, but can it work here? Let's wait and see!" Everyone lacked confidence and adopted the attitude of "seeing is believing." The leaders of the team decided to focus on experiments, gain experience, and then present a model before carrying out comprehensive promotion. Therefore, they selected the roof group and the frame group, which had simpler work, a better ideological foundation, and were willing to try, to conduct key experiments, and provided specific guidance and assistance to their work. First, they organized them to study, so that every worker in the group could master the characteristics and advantages of this working method. Then, according to the actual situation of the two groups, they divided the processes and implemented specialized division of labor. For example, the roof group originally had four people, and in the past there was no division of labor; whoever grabbed what, did what. Now they divide the work as follows: one person cuts materials, one person saws curved beams, one person punches holes, and one person installs, each with their own responsibilities. In this way, their minds are focused when working, and everyone can use their brains to think of ways to improve their work. As a result of everyone's active research, a roof that used to take thirty work hours now only takes twelve work hours. Another example is the frame group, which has doubled its labor efficiency due to the division of labor and the improvement of some tools. Making a frame has been reduced from thirty-one work hours to twenty-one work hours. The success of these two groups in implementing the assembly line method further strengthened the team leader's and group leaders' confidence in promoting Xie Wanfu's assembly line method.

    The leading cadres then studied and summarized the work of the roof group and the frame group, and vigorously promoted it, holding successive meetings such as the entire team's worker congress and group meetings. The team leader introduced at the meeting the achievements and experiences gained by the two groups after implementing the assembly line method, explained the important role of the promotion of this advanced method in production reform and the completion of plans, and calculated a detailed account. Then, they organized the workers to repeatedly discuss it. After the discussion, the vast majority of workers had a clearer understanding, increased their confidence, and took action one after another.

    Establish a Set of Inspection Systems

    From July 11th, the entire team implemented the assembly line method. A new atmosphere appeared in production. They changed the original labor organization, determined the processes according to the entire production process of the carpentry workshop, and reallocated labor according to each worker's technical conditions, proficiency, and strengths. For example, electric saws require attention to safety, so they are operated by experienced and careful people. Young workers need to be trained, so they are assigned to the finished product group, where it is easy to learn techniques. The material collection group used to have few people and a lot of work, and they were too busy, so the material collection group was expanded to avoid work stoppages waiting for materials.

    In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the assembly line method, they also formulated a set of inspection systems, with the original technical research group responsible for the inspection work, summarizing and inspecting every five days. The focus of the inspection is on product quality, machine efficiency, and safety. In order to strengthen the leadership of the entire team, the team leader's tasks were also clarified, focusing on checking quality, grasping the overall situation, and promptly summarizing experience.

    After the comprehensive implementation of the assembly line method, the team has reduced the labor required to manufacture a locomotive from 196 work hours to 144 work hours, a reduction of 52 work hours, and an increase in work efficiency of 26.5%.

    北京市电车公司修造厂木工班推广流水作业法的经验
    张昆峰
    北京市电车公司修造厂木工班，原先在生产上是该厂的一个落后的环节，但经过学习谢万福流水作业法先进经验后，已变为一个生产上先进的单位。该厂从七月一日开展红旗竞赛以后，由于全面地推广了先进工作方法，木工班半月以来即完成工作任务百分之一百二十六点五，全班连得三次“满堂红”。从六月下旬到七月上旬半个月的时间，工人提出了四十六个窍门。这个班的成绩是怎样获得的呢？
    打通中层、基层领导干部思想
    为全面推广工作打下基础
    领导干部及时总结了大修班装车盘时流水作业法的经验后，便帮助木工班来推行谢万福流水作业法。为了有力地推广这个先进的工作方法，全班成立了核心小组，也就是包括班长、工会小组长、生产小组长及技术员参加的技术研究小组。他们抓住了这个领导核心，从打通班长、小组长等领导干部思想着手，组织他们学习和研究这个工作法。在开始时，大家对这个先进的工作方法有着不同的认识，有的说：“咱们现在分的九个组就是分工专业流水作业法了。”有的说：“不必分工，只要大家技术熟练，效率也就差不多了。”又有人说：“一个人专作一件活，活那么多，咱们人不够用了，要添人。”为了使大家认识谢万福流水作业法的优越性以及木工班学习这个工作法的必要，在班长积极带头下，领导大家深入而又具体地分析了木工班的生产情况。经过一个多星期的分析研究，发现木工班的工作存在着很多缺点。如班内只有组与组的分工，组里却没有分工。而且组的分工也不明确，各组之间又联系不够，经常发生停工待料的现象。像取料组人数较少，取料不够及时，影响了其他组工作，因此别的组就自己取料。大家为了急于完成自己的任务，争先下料，争抢电锯电刨等工具，工具就不够使用，还经常发生电刨刨手的事故。夜班取料组没有人，机器每天也只能运转八小时。研究这些缺点后，大家认识到，只有很好学习谢万福流水作业法，才能提高木工班的生产效率。中层领导干部在思想上取得了一致的认识后，给全班推广先进经验的工作打下一个很好的基础。
    重点试验，取得经验
    中层干部的思想虽然通了，但当把这个先进工作法向班内推行时，工人思想上还没有通，有的工人说：“大修班推行的流水作业法，我们班早就实行了，没有什么了不起。”有的工人认为：“谢万福工作效率提得那么高，这太玄虚，不一定可靠。”有的工人认为：“谢万福工作法比较简单，只适用于做门和窗户，而我们搞的是电车，活儿又多又杂，恐怕行不通吧。”群众中最普遍的思想是：“谢万福这个方法好倒是好，但在我们这儿能不能行呢，走着瞧吧！”大家信心不高，抱着“耳听为虚，眼见是实”的态度。班的领导干部就决定重点试验，取得经验后，摆出样子，再行全面推广。于是选择了工作比较简单，思想基础较好又愿意试一试的车顶组和车架组，进行重点试验，并具体指导和帮助他们的工作。首先组织他们学习，使组内每个工人掌握这个工作法的特点和优点，接着就按两组的实际情况，划分了工序，实行专业分工。如车顶组原来四个人，过去没有分工，谁抓住什么干什么。现在他们分工如下：一人裁料，一人锯弯梁，一人打眼，一人按装，各有专责；这样，干活时思想集中，每人都能对自己工作动脑筋想办法。由于大家积极钻研的结果，一个车顶过去要用三十个工，现已降到十二个工。再如车架组，由于进行了分工并改进了一些工具，已提高劳动效率两倍。做一个车架，已由三十一个工降到二十一个工。这两个组试行流水作业法成功，进一步坚定了班长小组长等推广谢万福流水作业法的信心。
    领导干部接着研究和总结了车顶组和车架组的工作，并大力展开宣传，连续召开全班工人大会、小组会等。由班长在会上介绍两组实行流水作业法后所取得的成绩和经验，说明这种先进方法的推广，对生产改革与完成计划有重要作用，并算了一下细账，然后组织工人反复进行讨论。绝大多数工人经过讨论以后，心里有了底，增强了信心，纷纷行动起来。
    建立一套检查制度
    从七月十一日起，全班实行了流水作业法。在生产上出现了一片新气象。他们改变了原来的劳动组织，按照木工班整个生产过程定出工序，又根据每个工人的技术条件、熟练程度、特长等来重新配备了劳动力。如电锯要注意安全，就由有经验而细心的人担任。青工需要培养，就分配到容易学技术的成品组。取料组过去人少活多，忙不过来，因此扩大了取料组，避免了停工待料现象。
    为了流水作业法顺利进行，他们还订出了一套检查制度，由原来技术研究小组担任检查工作，每五天检查总结一次。检查重点是产品质量、机器效能与安全等。为了加强全班的领导，也明确了班长的任务，重点在于检查质量、掌握全面和及时总结经验。
    全面实行流水作业法后，该班每制造一台机车，已由一百九十六个工降为一百四十四个工，缩减了五十二个工，提高工作效率百分之二十六点五。
