Foreword
Since early 1952, unusual phenomena have occurred in North Korea and Northeast China, leading the people and governments of these two countries to claim that they have been targeted by bacterial warfare. The seriousness of this situation is well-known worldwide, as people have long expressed opposition and even hatred towards such methods of warfare. Therefore, an International Scientific Commission was established to investigate the facts on the ground.

The commission members recognized the gravity of their responsibility and made every effort to rid themselves of preconceived notions, adopting the highest degree of objectivity and adhering to the most rigorous scientific principles in their investigations. This report presents the detailed work and conclusions derived from their investigations.

This report was written in collaboration with eight languages, aiming for clarity and comprehensibility for people worldwide, rather than adhering strictly to literary style.

Organization and Work of the Commission
On February 22, 1952, Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and on March 8, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, formally protested against the U.S. conducting bacterial warfare. On February 25, Dr. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, lodged a complaint with the World Peace Council.

On March 29, at the meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Peace Council in Oslo, Dr. Guo Moruo, with the assistance of the Chinese delegation and the presence of Korean representative Li Ju-yong, provided many materials related to this issue to the committee members and representatives of other countries. Dr. Guo stated that the governments of China and Korea believed that the International Committee of the Red Cross could not conduct an impartial investigation on the ground due to political bias. However, the two governments fully hoped to invite an international body composed of impartial and independent scientists to conduct an on-the-ground investigation of the facts on which the accusations were based. Regardless of their affiliation with peace-seeking organizations, these individuals were known for their dedication to humanitarian causes. The task of this body was to confirm or refute these accusations. After careful discussion, the Executive Committee unanimously decided to organize such an International Scientific Commission.

Following the Oslo meeting, efforts were immediately made to invite a sufficient number of prominent scientists from Europe, South America, and India. After their initial acceptance, Dr. Qian Sanqiang, Director of the Institute of Modern Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and responsible for organizing the commission's work in Europe after the Oslo meeting, issued invitations on behalf of Dr. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. By mid-June, the commission had reached the minimum necessary number of members, who then departed for China under the escort of Dr. Qian.

The members of the International Scientific Commission arrived in Beijing on June 21 and 28, respectively, and were warmly welcomed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace. The list of members is as follows:

Dr. Andrén (Sweden), Director of the Central Clinical Laboratory of the Stockholm Municipal Hospital.
Professor Madelain (France), Director of the Department of Animal Physiology at the National School of Agronomy in Grignon, former expert on livestock for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and corresponding member of the Italian and Spanish Veterinary Associations.
Professor Joseph Needham (UK), Fellow of the Royal Society, Lecturer at the William Dunn Chair of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge, former scientific advisor to the British Embassy in Chongqing, and Director of the Natural Sciences Department of UNESCO.
Professor Oliver (Italy), Professor of Human Anatomy at the University of Broni, former lecturer in general biology at the University of Toulon.
Professor Bessoia (Brazil), Professor of Parasitology at the University of São Paulo, former Director of Public Health for the State of São Paulo, and honorary professor at the medical schools of Rossif and Paraba.
Academician Zhukov-Verezhnikov (USSR), Deputy Director of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences and Professor of Bacteriology, former chief medical expert in the trial of Japanese bacterial warfare criminals in Khabarovsk.
Although we regret that some prominent figures in the scientific community could not attend, the commission set July 15 as the final deadline for registration. However, we warmly welcomed
Dr. Graziosi (Italy), Assistant at the Institute of Microbiology at the University of Rome. He arrived in Beijing before the commission returned from Shenyang on August 6. Since he could only attend the last three weeks of the commission's work, his position was that of an "advisory consultant," where he provided significant assistance to the proceedings (see Appendix 44). Finally,
Dr. Qian Sanqiang (China), Director of the Institute of Modern Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, participated. He represented Dr. Guo and accompanied the commission from Europe to Beijing. He was appointed as a liaison officer by the Chinese side based on the unanimous invitation of the commission and could speak during the commission's discussions but had no voting rights.

The group also included:
Mr. Koval'sky: Translator and secretary for Academician Zhukov-Verezhnikov.
Mrs. Bessoia: Translator and secretary for Dr. Bessoia.

The International Scientific Commission also received assistance from the Chinese side's reception committee. This committee was composed of the following individuals:

Chairman:
Mrs. Li Dequan, Chairman of the Chinese Red Cross Society and member of the World Peace Council.
Vice-Chairmen:
Mr. Liao Chengzhi, member of the World Peace Council.
Dr. He Cheng, Honorary President of the Chinese Medical Association.
Secretary-General:
Dr. Gong Naquan, President of Shanghai Medical College.
Deputy Secretary-General:
Dr. Ji Suhua, Secretary of the Chinese Medical Association.
Expert Liaison Officer:
Dr. Zhong Huilian, President of Beijing People's Hospital, Professor of Internal Medicine at Peking Union Medical College.
Dr. Wu Zaidong, Professor of Pathology at Nanjing University Medical College.
Professor Fang Gang, Associate Researcher at the Central Institute of Hygiene, Department of Microbiology.
Dr. Zhu Hongfu, Deputy Director of the Institute of Entomology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Dr. Yan Renying, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Peking University Medical College.
Dr. Yang Shida, Professor and Dean of Public Health at Shanghai Aurora University.

During the journey, the members of the reception committee accompanied the commission, completing various liaison tasks in dangerous and difficult situations. The experts from the reception committee and other Chinese scientists and doctors often attended the various meetings of the commission and provided testimony. The commission expresses its deep gratitude and respect for their scientific expertise and loyalty.

Regarding the commission's meetings, the chairmanship was rotated among the members. Mr. Madelain was elected as the scientific secretary. The commission's first meeting was held on June 23 in Beijing. All meeting schedules are listed in Appendix 1.

The commission's general work was closely coordinated with the Central Health Department of China, the Northeast Health Department of Shenyang, and the Ministry of Health of North Korea, as well as their secretariats. The commission received assistance from many scientists related to this issue. In addition to those already mentioned, the commission wishes to express its gratitude to Wang Bin, Director of the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government, and his deputy, Bai Xiqing. Despite facing difficulties and severe air raid dangers, they calmly handled various matters. These renowned medical personnel's spirit is admirable.

In this regard, the commission had the honor of meeting many Korean bacteriologists and other experts and deeply admired their loyal service to their country. The commission also pays tribute to three of the finest Korean bacteriologists who sacrificed their lives during the work. Notably, the famous Chinese experts from the volunteer epidemic prevention inspection teams, such as Dr. Chen Wengui, Dr. Wei Xi, and Dr. He Qi, left their quiet laboratories in China to share the hardships and dangers with the Korean people on the front lines against bacterial warfare. Their selfless spirit is commendable.

The commission held various types of meetings. Sometimes, all members discussed scientific issues for many hours, sometimes Chinese experts were also present, and sometimes a large room was needed to hear testimony from many different professions. Among the witnesses were a captured spy (Appendix 36) and four captured U.S. airmen (Appendices 37 to 40). The commission authorized two or three-person groups, along with Chinese colleagues (experts), to jointly study specific issues and report back to the commission. Often, the entire day was spent in laboratories in Beijing, Shenyang, and Pyongyang, where Chinese and Korean scientists presented their research results in detail. When necessary, the commission members utilized the excellent libraries in Beijing and Shenyang.

The materials prepared by Chinese and Korean experts on these cases form the entire appendix of this report. In the following text, there will be a brief description of these appendices. It must be noted that they are not individual cases but examples from a large amount of data. The examples presented here are more from China than from Korea because the Koreans were working under relatively difficult conditions, and the commission's working time in Korea was relatively short and in a particularly difficult period.

At the same time, the commission felt it necessary to familiarize itself with the original scientific records from the documents issued by Prague in early 1952. These documents should be verified or refuted as much as possible. It is necessary to clarify these documents because they contain misunderstandings, temporary identifications that were later withdrawn, and complete translation errors. From many appendices, it can be seen that the commission did a lot of work in this regard, and the overall conclusions obtained by the commission through this work, in fact, confirm the main arguments of the previous reports from several investigation teams sent from Prague.

The commission's main travels were as follows: From June 23 to July 9, the main clues were sorted out in Beijing, then to Shenyang, where work was conducted from July 12 to 25. Afterwards, accompanied by the reception committee, the commission crossed the Yalu River to North Korea and held multiple meetings in Pyongyang from July 28 to 31 (except for interruptions due to air raids). Before returning to Northeast China on August 6, the commission spent two days in a certain place meeting with captured airmen. It should be noted that the organization of this trip was technically flawless.

There was another earlier but shorter trip on July 15 and 16. The commission took a special plane, train, and jeep to Qiqihar and then turned to the villages near Gan Nan County via Laha, which were the sites where small field mice infected with plague bacilli were scattered (see Appendix 13). These places are in Heilongjiang Province, near the border with Inner Mongolia. Other formal trips were relatively minor.

It is important to note that such an organization as the commission inevitably encounters many language difficulties. The commission members speak seven different languages, but the most commonly used and understood is French, so French was adopted as the working language. Whenever Russian, English, and Italian were used, they were immediately translated into French. On the Chinese side, many Chinese scientists could speak fluent English or French, which facilitated the work. However, they spoke Chinese during meetings, which was immediately translated into French. The French translators were Dr. Yang Shida and Mr. Ding Qiqian. The Russian translator was Dr. Chen Shu. The English translator was Dr. Yan Renying. In the later stages of the work, Dr. Wu Hengxing provided very valuable assistance in text and language. The commission also had an advantage that one member could speak and understand Chinese, which was particularly useful when interviewing witnesses, and could read and write Chinese, making it more convenient to read reference materials and examine documents. Another member was also fluent in English and Russian. The situation in Korea was more complex because very few Chinese scientists could understand Korean. However, the commission was fortunate to have the help of Dr. Yu Renxie, an outstanding linguist, who could accurately translate Korean into French, English, and Chinese. There were also other Korean-Chinese translators. Simultaneously, there was a parallel translation from Korean to Chinese and then to a European language, and directly from Korean to Russian. Due to frequent cross-checking of notes, it can be seen that there was very little possibility of errors in content. Finally, some meetings were recorded on tape for future reference. For the above reasons, the commission believes that it would not be completely unable to understand the opinions of Chinese and Korean experts and witnesses due to language difficulties.

The names of the commission members signing below are accompanied by their qualifications and academic expertise. They gathered various experiences in long, complex, and extensive discussions. In all matters, when only scientific methods of knowledge and understanding were needed, everyone contributed equally; when the problem was outside their own expertise, they trusted the criticism and interpretation of more qualified commission members. Therefore, this report is a truly collective work.

The commission members personally saw and heard many things, so they are responsible for these testimonies. In addition, the commission had to rely on documents from Korea and China. Although there was no reason to doubt the abilities and honesty of Korean and Chinese medical personnel and other scientists, the commission still took all necessary precautions. The commission did not relax in analyzing cases and, when possible, directly entered the original facts despite the greatest difficulties. The members were always alert not to be influenced by any political, ethical, or emotional factors, so the commission's work was conducted in a calm, scientific, and objective atmosphere. The commission's final belief naturally depended to some extent on the testimonies of hundreds of witnesses, all of whom the commission had interviewed and questioned. Their testimonies were so clear, consistent, and independent that they were beyond doubt.

In the narrative of this report, it is obviously impossible to write the basis for every sentence of Korean or Chinese evidence. The experiments, inspections, and interrogations conducted by the commission members are generally mentioned in the main text. In all cases, the detailed data are placed in the relevant documents and records, which are all marked.

All detailed qualifications of Chinese and Korean scientists mentioned in the documents are recorded in the last appendix (Appendix 46).

Documents
When the commission members first gathered, the documents they could obtain were those announced by the Chinese government and distributed by the secretariat of the World Peace Council in Prague to various countries in the West, or distributed by the official Chinese news agencies in various countries.

The first report from the Korean Ministry of Health (SIA/1) covers events from January to February 1952. The materials contained in this report were re-organized in the report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team (SIA/4), which added materials on the discovery of plague in Korea and the results of personal interviews with witnesses by this group of international figures.

The two most detailed reports are those of the "Investigation Team on the Bacteriological Warfare Crimes of American Imperialism" conducted in March in Korea and Northeast China. The main report is that of the Korean branch of the investigation team, printed in Beijing in April, with the full text published by the New China News Agency (NCNA/85), and a summary in SIA/13. The report of the Northeast branch was also printed in Beijing, with a summary in SIA/3. This report contains sufficient entomological data. The report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team on the same content did not add anything new with strict scientific significance, printed in Beijing, SIA/8 published the full text.

A special report by some European scientists collaborating with the secretariat of the World Peace Council, verifying the identification of insects with photographs, including materials from Korea and Northeast China, is found in SIA/2. Another special report by four Chinese scientists based on the same materials is found in SIA/12.

Those who wish to study the early reports should do so in the order mentioned above. However, when the members of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' Investigation Team returned to Europe in mid-April, many new typewritten copies were ready for them to take back, especially ten important cases; but at that time, these case materials had not been fully analyzed. Because these case materials were numbered 00001 to 00010, we call them the "40 cases."

The remaining materials, although more legal and personal in nature, are not without scientific significance. The testimonies of witnesses include some related to cases already mentioned elsewhere (such as 00005), collected in SIA/6 and 10. The confessions of American prisoners of war and spies are collected in SIA/7. There are many documents of detailed confessions from U.S. airmen prisoners (SIA/14, 15, 17, 18), which were originally photographed and printed by the World Peace Council in May. Various newspaper clippings about bacterial warfare are collected in SIA/5.

[Note] The following codes replace the sources of various documents: SIA, Prague documents; NCNA, New China News Agency; ISCC, documents provided by China to the International Scientific Commission; ISCK, documents provided by Korea to the International Scientific Commission.

Materials Related to Japan's Bacterial Warfare During World War II
Japan undoubtedly conducted bacterial warfare against China during World War II, and it was impossible to investigate bacterial warfare in East Asia without acknowledging this fact. The commission is more familiar with this issue because one of its members was a chief expert in the Khabarovsk trial, and another was one of the few Western scientists who served during the period when these events occurred. In 1944, one of his tasks was to report to his own government that, although initially skeptical, the materials collected by the Chinese Military Medical Service seemed to clearly indicate that the Japanese had spread plague-infected fleas in several regions. Thus, they could cause a considerable number of bubonic plague cases in areas that were not originally epidemic but had conditions suitable for transmission. As is known, under normal circumstances, bubonic plague only occurs in certain limited regions (such as Fujian Province), and it generally does not spread outside these regions.

Before the commission, there is a draft of a report from the archives of the Chinese Ministry of Health, whose content is about the artificial plague caused by the Japanese in Changde, Hunan, in 1941 (Appendix 11, ISCC/1). This document still has considerable value today and has historical significance. The official Chinese records list eleven counties attacked by the Japanese in this way, four in Zhejiang, two each in Hebei and Henan, one each in Shanxi, Hunan, and Shandong. The Chinese believe that about 700 people suffered from artificially spread plague between 1940 and 1944.

Furthermore, the following document has historical value. According to the report, the Chinese Military Medical Service at that time distributed ten copies of this document to the embassies in Chongqing, and according to the famous Merck (MERCK) report of June 1946, the large-scale research on bacterial warfare methods by the United States also began in the same year, 1941. This is not a coincidence. The commission is pleased to have the opportunity to meet and listen to the statements of the outstanding plague expert who authored the Changde memorandum during the work in Korea, pointing out that the Nationalist Party did not pursue these evidences at the end of World War II (see Appendix 12). As is known, his conclusions were later completely confirmed by the testimonies of the defendants in the Khabarovsk trial.

The publication of the materials of the case "Former Japanese soldiers accused of preparing and using bacterial warfare" (Moscow, 1950) provided the world with rich materials on the actual work conducted under the guidance of Japanese bacterial expert Shiro Ishii (unfortunately, he himself did not appear). Undoubtedly, large-scale bacterial production technology was used, producing bacterial cultures of cholera, typhoid, and plague, sometimes in hundreds of kilograms. Simple technology was also used to breed large numbers of rodents and fleas, but it seems that only the latter was actually spread. Moreover, different witnesses could always cite examples to say that the Japanese had been to their bases in China on a certain day, inspecting the methods that had been implemented. Inside, there were many detailed materials about secret units (such as the infamous "731") and their laboratories, experimental factories, and prisons; in this prison, patriotic Chinese and Russians were cruelly used as experimental animals (page 106). (New China News Agency note: This is the original page number of the "Report," the same below.) During the work, the commission had the opportunity to examine several remaining ceramic "bombs," which were made for Ishii in a special factory in Harbin. This will be discussed later.

It seems that the Japanese military leaders never gave up the idea of generally using biological weapons, especially spreading insects as weapons, to achieve world conquest. Before they withdrew from Dalian, they systematically tore out all documents related to bacterial warfare from the libraries of universities and various departments. It should not be forgotten that before the beginning of the accusations against the U.S. military for conducting bacterial warfare in Korea and Northeast China in early 1952, the newspapers had already published news revealing that Shiro Ishii had gone to South Korea twice, and he went again in March. Whether the occupation authorities in Japan encouraged his activities, and whether the Far East Command of the U.S. military was using Japanese methods, these are questions that every member of the commission could not help but consider.

Methods of the Commission's Analysis of Events
Due to the special nature of bacterial warfare, it is difficult to prove that bacterial warfare has been conducted. For example, complete evidence would require: an aircraft being forced to land, the biological entities it carried being intact, the airmen immediately admitting their actions, etc. Obviously, for many reasons, such a situation is difficult to occur. Therefore, it is necessary to devise a method to connect many things, making them coherent, mutually verifiable, and forming a case with evidence. Thus, for the commission's thinking and work, a format is first needed, which can serve as a framework for the study of each specific case.

The simplest format, in an ideal situation, has each component:
(Appendix Table)

Naturally, such a complete set is very difficult to encounter, even permanently. However, some cases are very close to completeness, making it possible to make a decision. Thus, the activities of the people using these methods can be connected, and the effects produced by these activities can be explained. The commission therefore pays special attention to facts that are illustrative. By studying complex facts, the overall situation becomes clear (see page 232).

Entomological Data from the Prague Documents
When the commission began working in Beijing, one of the primary tasks before them was to systematically study the scientific data on which the Prague documents were based, and the first step was to list the entomological evidence identified by Chinese scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and other institutions together with them. The commission quickly recognized the undoubted high level of expertise of the Chinese scientists (Appendix 8) and their extensive library facilities, including a rapid inter-institutional lending system and many well-organized insect specimens. The only practical but insurmountable difficulty was that, despite half a century of work, the systematic classification of many insects was still not completely clear. Therefore, for newly introduced insects, it was not possible to determine with certainty whether they were indeed from there, and the commission had to be satisfied with the fact that in some cases, certain types of insects appeared in groups, at least in areas where they had not been recorded locally before.

Samples of typical anomalous insects identified by Chinese experts after the passage of U.S. aircraft were made into a table (Appendix 8). This includes nine species of Diptera (six species of flies and three species of mosquitoes and midges), one species of Plecoptera, one species of Thysanoptera, one species of Collembola, three species of Orthoptera, and two species of Arachnida. Including the beetle mentioned below, there are a total of eighteen species.

In the documents published in Europe, it was given the impression that some of the discovered insects had never been seen, not only in species but also in genera, in the relevant regions of the Asian continent; but this was not confirmed. Although this is the case, in three cases, there were obvious anomalies in this regard. Among the many groups of insects collected, the black fly of the genus Hylemyia, which had been identified multiple times, was proven to be different from the four common species in Northeast China and different from the fifteen species recorded in China. However, this genus, when all parts of the world are included, has 600 species, and their distribution is still not completely clear (Appendix 8). Similarly, the obtained dung fly (Helomyza modesta; Meigen) is definitely different from the only species of this genus recorded in China (Appendix 8). The situation is the same for the midge (Orthocladius). Such differences in zoology and geography must be given appropriate attention when considering various evidence.

In any case, the ecological anomalies are more peculiar than the zoological and geographical ones. Regardless of whether each species is unfamiliar or not unfamiliar to the local area, the appearance of large groups of insects in the first three months of the year, when there was still snow on the ground in Northeast China and Korea, is indeed very strange. The commission can undoubtedly prove that these insect groups can be seen by many ordinary men and women (and as quickly as possible to eliminate them). Among the eighteen species mentioned above, at least twelve species are obviously anomalous in their appearance season (Appendix 8). In other words, their early and massive appearance, according to the personal experience of qualified entomologists and published literature, appeared six to fourteen weeks earlier than the normal annual appearance time. On average, nine weeks earlier—more than two months (Appendix 8).

Here, several interesting questions arise. It is easy to imagine collecting tens of thousands of flies the size of houseflies. However, snow fleas or springtails (Isotoma legishina; Borner) are so small (only 2 millimeters long) that a large number of them must be present in a dense concentration to attract attention (Appendix 8). The estimated specific numbers of possible densities are listed in the table (Appendix 7). In SIA/12, one of the Chinese entomologists conducted an important observation that some of the black flies (Hylemyia) found at temperatures below -10°C (Celsius) were about to lay eggs, thus deepening the mystery of their origin. Similarly surprising is the case of the oil beetle (Gryllus testaceus), and in 1951, there was a very complete article in Beijing discussing its life history (Appendix 8). Thousands of these adult insects were found in March in the countryside near Kuandian in Liaodong Province. However, in this season, even in Beijing, which has a warmer climate than Northeast China, this insect is in the egg stage and will not have adult insects appear.

Assuming that there are individual and scattered examples of various insects appearing in winter in entomological literature, it is difficult to believe that the simultaneous appearance of so many species is purely due to natural causes. The commission affirms that the weather conditions in Northeast China and Korea last winter were completely normal (Appendix 8). Therefore, it is not surprising that the Chinese and Koreans associate these anomalies with the passage of U.S. aircraft, especially with the fact that unexploded objects were seen dropped by U.S. aircraft multiple times. The commission interviewed many witnesses who saw these phenomena (Appendices 22, 25, and 28) and confirmed their honesty and reliability. We will see that many ordinary and very special containers have been discovered (see page 215) and studied. Unfortunately, in some documents sent to Europe (such as the 40 documents), the important explanation that there was an aircraft flyover before the event was omitted, but the commission clarified this main point (Appendix 7).

Another argument acknowledges that the appearance season of a considerable number of insect species is indeed earlier; but insists that even if this cannot be attributed to abnormal weather conditions, there are certain natural factors at work, causing all phenomena to be equally advanced. Fortunately, testing this is very easy. Just arrange various insects in the order of their normal appearance and then draw curves of their anomalous appearance in the same way; if a natural factor is at work, then the two curves should be parallel. However, looking at the first figure (Appendix 8) is enough to see that the two curves are not like this, and the order of anomalous appearance is completely random, thus showing the influence of a human factor.

Before the commission began work, there was an assumption in various European countries that napalm bombing had been conducted recklessly, which might have strongly heated part of the land. This influence could have disrupted the normal life cycle of various insects, causing them to appear several weeks or even months earlier than the normal season. Therefore, the commission paid special attention to the fact that in many places in Northeast China, large groups of insects were found, including thirty-three main events (some of which are listed in the sub-table, Appendix 7), but undoubtedly, this region of Northeast China had never been bombed with napalm.

The above opinions are all applicable to the various insects mentioned in the SIA series and similar documents. Some are described using common names, such as "ants" and "horse flies," which Chinese entomologists could not confirm. This may be due to the non-scientific common names used by ordinary witnesses, causing confusion. Later, the commission studied new evidence related to a beetle of the order Coleoptera, the specimen beetle (Ptinus) (Appendix 27), which we will discuss elsewhere. In this and other cases related to disease-carrying insects, the materials collected in the appendices are sufficient for studying the relationship between the spread of infectious diseases and the occurrence of epidemics. The measures taken by China and Korea to control insects (see Appendix 42) and whether the normally collected insect specimens carry pathogens (Appendices 4 and 5) are also related to this.

Medical Notes on the Spread of Insects
In the following sections, readers will encounter some terms related to arthropods, which may not be familiar to non-experts. The purpose of the following text is to explain these terms in the order corresponding to the appendices.

One commonly spread insect is the black fly (Anthomyiid Fly, Hylemyia sp.), especially common in North America. This genus of flies has over 500 species, some of which live in human dwellings. Because they breed in human feces, they naturally become important vectors for intestinal diseases. Many species overwinter in the soil in the form of pupae and generally do not appear in large numbers before May. Under natural conditions, these flies can be infected by various plant pathogens (see page 204 and Appendix 10A).

Dung flies (Helomyza Sp. - Family Helomyzidae) are insects that often gather on dung heaps. This type of fly includes dozens of species, most of which survive on the excrement of humans, bats, small mammals, and birds. Not only in the larval stage but also as adults. Some live in human dwellings, contaminating food and acting as mechanical vectors for human diseases caused by pathogens.

The housefly (Musca domestica) and its southern relative Muscavicina live around humans and are known to be vectors for human diseases. It is known to carry over 60 types of pathogens.

The large housefly (Muscina stabulans) is also considered a vector for human diseases living around humans.

The above are all Diptera. While Plecoptera is represented in the report by a species of Nemoura, a type of stonefly. These insects breed in flowing streams and small rivers. The larvae feed on aquatic microorganisms. Adults do not like to leave the places where they grow, and they can come into contact with humans through water and plants.

Collembola, represented by the genus Isotoma, are wingless insects of lower order. They grow in decaying plants, moist soil rich in organic matter, and the roots of vegetables. Some species grow on the water surface.

The human flea (Pulex irritans) has been proven to possibly cause severe outbreaks of plague under natural conditions (Blanc et Balbhazar). In the following text, it can be seen that this vector has been used in bacterial warfare.

The genus Ptinus fur, to which the specimen beetle belongs, includes 35 to 40 species, most of which have similar lifestyles. Some live around humans. The genus used here is commonly found in human dwellings, warehouses, livestock pens, granaries, mills, libraries, and production sites. They eat peeled grains, cereals, cotton seeds, dry bread, flour, hay, fur, leather, carpets. They lay eggs on their food. Their metamorphosis process takes three to four months, so at least three generations can be produced in a year. The adult lifespan can reach five years. This beetle is found in Europe, Asia, and North America and is widely distributed. Highly toxic anthrax bacilli have been isolated from this beetle (Appendices 27 and 28).

Spiders are represented here by the two-toothed wolf spider and the three-toothed wolf spider. They are carnivorous, eating mosquitoes, flies, ants, and other insects. These insects may be vectors for human diseases. When the three-toothed wolf spider attacks humans, the diseases we generally see are not only caused by poisonous bites but also by infections that occur simultaneously with the bites. Pathogens can also spread through the excrement of the three-toothed wolf spider. These spiders can live for several years, and adult two-toothed wolf spiders can survive for two years without food and for several months without water. Three-toothed wolf spiders can tolerate mild freezing.

In scientific literature, descriptions of artificial cultivation of insects and spiders can be found. The most complete explanation of this aspect can be found in the collective work of American entomologists "Cultivation of Invertebrates" (published in New York in 1937).

Therefore, based on the above opinions, it can be seen that some of the spread insects are recognized vectors of diseases, but there are also those not listed in textbooks as vectors of diseases. Among these types, some, such as the black fly Hylemyia sp. and the dung fly Helomyza sp., often enter human dwellings, while others, such as the springtail Isotoma sp., have little contact with humans. Therefore, initially, these arthropods do not seem to play an important role in spreading human diseases. However, we cannot ignore the "specificity" of vectors, which has great elasticity, and the various relationships between vectors and parasites still have some unclear aspects. For example, the relationship between humans and chicken mites Dermanyssus gallinae can only occur under strictly specific conditions. Until 1944, no one knew the important role of these ectoparasites in transmitting and preserving encephalitis viruses. Before this period, deliberately using chicken mites to cause encephalitis epidemics would have been considered absurd.

As for insects that have close contact with humans, it is not necessarily true that they are more suitable for being effective vectors than wild species. In many examples, we can cite the species Aedes scapularis and Haemagogus spegazzinii of mosquitoes, which can transmit yellow fever under laboratory conditions. The first species of mosquito is very fond of living in human dwellings and usually lives in houses near forests. However, the second species never enters human dwellings. Species that live with humans do not have a significant role in transmitting yellow fever, but wild species are generally recognized as vectors for yellow fever.

We can use the springtail Isotoma as an example to make many assumptions, but we must not forget that this is just a conjecture, because we do not know whether there have been experiments related to them:

1. Springtail → infects lower mammals → ectoparasites (fleas, scabies mites, etc.) → infects humans.
2. Springtail → contaminates food or water → infects humans.
3. Springtail's internal pathogens multiply → congenital disease in springtails → infects lower mammals → infects ectoparasites → infects humans.
4. Springtail → infects plants.

There are several other assumptions that are also plausible.

Similar assumptions can be applied to stoneflies, Nemoura, but here there may be other possibilities that are currently difficult to imagine.

As for semi-domesticated flies, it is not difficult to recognize their vector role, especially under artificial laboratory conditions, the infection rate can be increased, and the virulence of pathogens can be enhanced.

Here, an important point must be noted: the same species can be semi-wild in one region and live in human dwellings in another region. For example, a species of Kerteszia mosquitoes in South America at 24 degrees south latitude does not have the habit of living in human dwellings and does not play a role in transmitting malaria. However, south of 24 degrees south latitude, they become domestic insects and play an important role in transmitting malaria.

Finally, it takes a considerable amount of research to determine the role of arthropods as vectors for parasitic diseases and bacterial diseases, such as mosquitoes for malaria, fleas for plague, and lice and bedbugs for rickettsial diseases.

Regarding the role of arthropods in spreading diseases, this is a problem that needs to be continuously studied. The use of rare vectors is intended to hope that people have not yet found control methods for less common species.

Regarding the methods of bacterial warfare, it can be seen that it is possible to establish new biological relationships artificially. Although solving this problem requires arduous research, there is still a chance of success.

Plant Pathology Data
Previous documents have mentioned several times the event of U.S. aircraft dropping plant materials. According to eyewitness reports, these plant materials were often wrapped and burst at about 1,000 feet above the ground, scattering leaves or other parts of plants over a wide area. Such events occurred on March 20 in Jeonju, Korea (page 9 of document NCNA/85; page 4 of document SIA/13), and in more than ten places in Northeast China and North Korea, including one instance where this type of object was personally seen falling by a British war correspondent (page 2 of document SIA/6). The commission members discussed with internationally renowned Chinese plant pathologists and botanists the identification of these plants and fungi (Appendix 10A).

It has been positively proven that soybean stems and pods were infected with Cercospora sojina Hara (Cercosporina Kikuchii, Matsumoto & Tomoyasu), a type of true fungus. This fungus is a plant parasite and has been reported in Korea and China, causing serious damage and loss to soybean crops. As with the other cases discussed here, this pathogen enters the plant's tissues, indicating that it is not only on the surface but also inside.

In the scattered leaf fragments, some were infected with plant anthracnose (Glomerella sp., its asexual stage is Colletotrichum). This pathogen has a wide host range and has been proven to infect apples, pears, and cotton in inoculation experiments. Common cotton anthracnose (Glomerella gossypii (South) Edg.) only infects cotton and its related plants. While the bitter rot pathogen of apples (Glomerella cingulata (Stone-man) S. & S.) can infect more than 30 types of plants but does not infect cotton. These two fungi have been reported in China. However, the fungi found now are morphologically different from these two pathogens and have a wider host range.

The third example of spreading plant diseases is the recent event in July in the southern part of Liaodong Province, near Shenyang County, when the commission had already begun its work. The discovered peach leaves (not the natural host of this fungus) were infected with a fungus called Macrophoma kuwatsukai Hara, which can cause apples and pears to rot (ring spot), and cause ulcers and wilting on branches. Experimental evidence has proven its strong infectivity.

In the above three examples, there were eyewitnesses who saw the packages of plant materials falling at that time.

Another fact noted by the commission regarding the use of plant diseases as weapons is that in the frequent U.S. aircraft incursions into the Antu area near Sunjiabaozi Village, during one of the many air raids, scattered corn grains were found. Some of these corn grains were proven to be infected with a type of smut fungus (Thecaphora). This fungus is similar to the smut fungi found in Europe and America on leguminous plants (Thecaphora deformans). This fungus has never been reported in China.

Although the scattered leaf fragments are sometimes broken, only one case (the plant anthracnose case) could not identify the scientific name of the leaves. As the first case, the material was identified as soybean (Glycine max), the third case as peach leaves (Prunus Persica), and the fourth case as corn (Zea mays). In other events, the scattered tree leaves were mostly oak (Quercus spp.) and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare). Two of these have special significance (Appendix 10). One is the leaves scattered in the Dadeok Mountain area of North Korea, which have been identified as the leaves of the deciduous oak (Quercus aliena Bl., var. rubripes, Nakai); this tree is only distributed in the region south of 38 degrees north latitude in Korea. Another event is the leaves scattered on May 3 in Haerbin County, Northeast China, which have been identified as the leaves of (Lindera glauca Bl.); this tree only grows in South Korea and is not distributed in Northeast China.

It should be noted that, like the spread of human diseases, insects can also be used as vectors for the spread of plant diseases. For example, the black fly (Hylemyia spp.) (see page 201 and Appendix 10) is a vector for the fire blight of pears and apples (Erwinia amylovora), the wilting disease of corn (Phytomonas stewartii), and the soft rot of vegetables (Erwinia carotovora), and another fungal disease, the black leg of cabbage (Phomalingam). In addition, the large housefly (Muscina stabulans) (see page 201 and Appendix 10) can also carry the fire blight of pears and apples. These are well-known. Chinese plant pathologists have isolated various bacteria from scattered insects (and leaves). These bacteria are currently under study.

In summary, we can confidently say that the spread of plant diseases has become part of the biological warfare conducted in Korea and Northeast China.

Events in Korea (Plague)
We already know that during World War II, Japan used the classical method of spreading plague bacilli through containers or spraying, spreading large quantities of plague-infected fleas. Since early 1952, in many non-contiguous locations in North Korea, plague has occurred, always associated with the sudden appearance of large groups of fleas and the prior passage of U.S. aircraft. In the seven events reported in document SIA/1, the earliest occurred on February 11. In six of these events, the fleas found were carrying plague bacilli. Document SIA/4 also states that on February 18, U.S. aircraft spread fleas near Anju, which were proven by bacteriological examination to carry plague bacilli, and on February 25, a plague epidemic occurred in the village of Fusan-ri; in this village of 600 people, 50 were infected and 36 died (Appendix 7).

According to the best information available to the commission, there has been no plague in Korea in the past five centuries. The nearest center of an epidemic that occurred was 450 kilometers away in Northeast China or 1,500 kilometers away in Fujian in the south. Furthermore, in this climate, February is at least three months earlier than the normal plague season. Most importantly, the fleas found were not the type that can naturally carry plague bacilli, but human fleas (Pulex irritans). From the identification by the Chinese side (Appendix 12) and other materials (Appendix 19), we know that this is the same type of human flea used by Japan during World War II.

When the commission was in Korea, it was invited to study two cases (Appendices 18 and 20). First, at the end of March, a farmer in Jiangxi County found many fleas floating on the surface of a water jar in the open air, one meter high, the day after a U.S. aircraft hovered over his village at night. He was probably bitten by other fleas released at the same time, because he died of bubonic plague a few days later, and the diagnosis was fully confirmed by Korean and Chinese scientists using pathological and bacteriological examinations. These fleas were also proven to carry plague bacilli. The commission members examined the bacterial cultures separated from the body of the above patient by the experts mentioned, and were convinced that this was indeed plague bacilli. They also examined pathological specimens and tissue sections. The timely health measures taken in that place prevented the occurrence of other cases.

The second case studied was when two Chinese People's Volunteers, Lieutenants in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, found a dense group of fleas on a barren hillside near Huaiyang. Their distribution indicated that they were released from a container slowly falling in a northeasterly direction, but no container was found. The fleas were so dense that the ground and their pants turned black, and they were quite surprised—the commission later personally questioned these two young men. They returned to the barracks, brought helpers, and used kerosene and pine branches to burn and eliminate these fleas. In this case, these soldiers used various methods to protect themselves (Appendix 21), and they quickly carried out the extermination work, eliminating the fleas before they could reach the walkways. The bacteriological examinations conducted by the Korean and Chinese inspection teams confirmed that these fleas carried plague bacilli, and these fleas were human fleas.

It must be emphasized that these fleas are parasites on humans. According to the ecology of this insect, they cannot appear in large numbers outside houses. Then, how to explain the appearance of tens of thousands of human fleas in a remote area far from human dwellings? This is definitely not a natural gathering. The nearby stationed Chinese People's Volunteers heard the sound of an aircraft hovering over the area at 4 a.m. that day, which is more related to the discovery of human fleas.

Analyzing the entire epidemiological process of plague transmitted by human fleas, it is found that several normal links are missing. Normally, plague first occurs in rodent populations and then spreads to humans; human fleas obtain the infection from patients and then transmit it to others.

Due to these facts and other similar facts, the commission had no choice but to conclude that: the U.S. Air Force used methods similar to those used by Japan during World War II to spread plague in Korea, if not exactly the same.

During the discussion of these cases in Pyongyang, the commission received assistance from an outstanding Chinese plague expert, who is the author of the 1941 report (Appendix 11). He provided evidence that he had urged the Nationalist Party government to publicize Japan's bacterial warfare crimes to the world, but without success, believing that this was partly due to obstruction by the United States (Appendix 12). He also drew attention to the fact that the plague bacilli strains currently used in Korea have strong virulence.

Spreading fleas infected with plague bacilli is, of course, not the only method to cause a plague epidemic; other methods can also be used, and now we will see that other methods have indeed been used.

The Gan Nan Incident
Another case that the commission carefully studied is the sudden discovery of a group of infected small field mice suffering from plague. This event has a more complete sequence of events. On the morning of April 5, 1952, the villagers of four villages in Gan Nan County woke up to find many mouse-like animals around them (Appendix 13). Gan Nan County is located in the western part of Heilongjiang Province in Northeast China, adjacent to Inner Mongolia.

The previous night, many villagers had heard an aircraft flying overhead, and the Chinese air defense observation team provided intelligence that the aircraft crossed the Yalu River around 10 p.m. and flew over the Gan Nan area around 11:30 p.m., then returned along the original route, apparently completing its mission (Appendix 13). The Chinese air defense observation team identified it as an F/82 twin-body night fighter. The next morning, the villagers found many dying or dead small field mice in their houses and courtyards, on the roofs, and even on their kangs. Many were scattered around the villages. In an area of approximately 5x15 kilometers and its vicinity, a total of 717 were captured and killed (Appendix 13).

This is abnormal for the season because in this region, this type of small rodent usually does not appear until a month later and will not have such a large number. The appearance location is also abnormal because small field mice are not animals that often come to human settlements.

The discovered rodents also seemed to be abnormal in terms of region because the local residents had never seen them before. It can be identified as a small field mouse (Microtus) of the genus, similar in shape to Microtus (Stenocranius) gregalis, gregalis. Previously, Dejima (1941) had reported this type of rodent from some regions in Northeast China west of Gan Nan, and other scholars had also reported it from more western regions. Further classification research is still being conducted by Chinese scientists (Appendices 15 and 16). Furthermore, this genus of rodents is not included in the three common rodent species that carry plague bacilli in the plague-endemic areas of Northeast China (Appendix 13).

According to available records, the Gan Nan area has never had any type of plague, and there are sufficient reasons to prove that these small field mice are very unlikely to have migrated from the nearest plague-endemic area, because the distance is far and there are many obstacles (Appendix 14). In addition, in terms of the season, it is at least one month earlier than the usual time when plague is found in rodents in plague-endemic areas (Appendix 13). The small field mice used for bacteriological experiments were only preserved one, but the evidence of highly virulent plague bacilli obtained from this specimen, combined with the above testimony, clearly indicates that this group of animals is infected with plague. The commission members who were qualified to conduct experiments, together with Chinese scientists, personally conducted experiments in the bacteriological laboratory of the Chinese Medical University in Shenyang and showed them to all the commission members, confirming the evidence obtained by Chinese experts (Appendices 13 and 14).

The main missing link in this series of evidence is the lack of discovery of any container or "bomb." However, in a January 1952 issue of the Japanese magazine "Shukan Mainichi," a container made of hard paper with a parachute was introduced, which self-destructs after dropping its load of infected rodents, leaving no trace (Appendix 17). Therefore, this missing link is not sufficient to refute the above evidence. Another Japanese publication (Koa Shinbun, August 1952) revealed that Japan had an institution for mass-producing rodents, which was managed by Kawakami, a former assistant of Ishii (Appendix 41).

The only thing to add is that the commission in Shenyang heard the testimony of ten farmers, and visited their families one by one. At the same time, the testimony of the epidemiologist responsible for local health measures after the incident, the bacteriologist who conducted the investigation and separated the plague bacilli, and the zoologist responsible for the study of rodents was also heard. The commission believes that the local residents were able to avoid the danger of plague this time, thanks to the immediate preventive measures taken after the discovery of abnormal rodents and the swift elimination of all cats and dogs by noon that day. Among the preventive measures taken, there was a very effective method of eliminating fleas in the house, which was to move the furniture out of the house, lay a layer of dry grass on the ground and kang, and then burn the grass. This method is widely used in Northeast China. For these reasons, fleas carrying plague bacilli could not transmit the pathogen to humans.

Therefore, the commission's opinion is that undoubtedly, this large group of small field mice infected with plague was dropped by the aircraft that the villagers heard flying over the Gan Nan area on the night of April 4-5, 1952. This aircraft was a U.S. F/82 type twin-body night fighter.

The Kuandian Incident
There is a case where black flies and spiders appeared abnormally at the same time; the commission has conducted a detailed study of this (Appendix 22). On March 12, 1952, residents of Kuandian County in the southeastern part of Liaodong Province, near the Yalu River, saw eight U.S. F/86 fighter jets flying over the county seat around half past noon. They had no difficulty identifying the U.S. aircraft because U.S. aircraft had frequently invaded the county's airspace and almost daily. The Chinese air defense observation team confirmed that these aircraft were F/86 fighter jets and plotted their flight path. One person clearly saw one of them dropping a bright, cylindrical object. The object seemed to fall outside the East Gate, and the local residents, including students, immediately organized to search the area and found many black flies (Hylemyia sp.) and spiders (Tarentula sp.).

Nine days after this incident, a student who happened to be in the shallow pit created by the object falling and its vicinity discovered many fragments of the container (Appendices 22 and 23). The location was a cornfield on a sandbar, and the riverbed surrounding the sandbar was dry at that time (winter). The largest "fragment" was metallic, but most of the fragments were thin, porous limestone, whose nature was not immediately clear. Later, it was identified, and this will be discussed separately (see page 219). The next day, two highly qualified entomologists who had searched the area four days earlier arrived to inspect, collected more flies, and carefully collected as many container fragments as possible by melting the accumulated snow with hot water.

There was snow in the ditches, which can explain why the insects (sluggish in low-temperature environments) had been on the ground for more than a week and were still lingering in the vicinity of the fall. It can also explain why a large number of bird feathers were simultaneously dropped and remained in the same place. The appearance of these insects and spiders in this season is abnormal (see page 199), and in terms of insect species, there are also regional anomalies (see page 198).

The Chinese conducted standard bacteriological examinations and proved that the insects, spiders, and feathers all carried pathogenic anthrax bacilli (Bacillus anthracis) (Appendix 22). The discovery of this bacterium on or in arthropods is considered a very unusual phenomenon. Although the discovery of this bacterium on bird feathers is not particularly special, Chinese scientists conducted bacteriological examinations on feather specimens randomly collected from northern and northeastern China and did not find this bacterium (Appendix 6). Although these feathers may have been used only to package insects to ensure their safe landing, it must be remembered that in other incidents, feathers carrying anthrax were dropped alone. The result of this U.S. aircraft drop did not cause anthrax to occur in the county and its vicinity.

From the above facts, the commission had no choice but to reach the following conclusion: on March 12, at least one U.S. aircraft used at least one specially made container to drop insects and spiders carrying anthrax bacilli in the vicinity of this small city in Liaodong Province, Northeast China.

The Liaodong-Liaoxi Incident (Respiratory Anthrax)
The commission conducted a detailed study of the event where black flies and spiders appeared abnormally at the same time (Appendix 22). On March 12, 1952, residents of Kuandian County in the southeastern part of Liaodong Province, near the Yalu River, saw eight U.S. F/86 fighter jets flying over the county seat around half past noon. They had no difficulty identifying the U.S. aircraft because U.S. aircraft had frequently invaded the county's airspace and almost daily. The Chinese air defense observation team confirmed that these aircraft were F/86 fighter jets and plotted their flight path. One person clearly saw one of them dropping a bright, cylindrical object. The object seemed to fall outside the East Gate, and the local residents, including students, immediately organized to search the area and found many black flies (Hylemyia sp.) and spiders (Tarentula sp.).

Nine days after this incident, a student who happened to be in the shallow pit created by the object falling and its vicinity discovered many fragments of the container (Appendices 22 and 23). The location was a cornfield on a sandbar, and the riverbed surrounding the sandbar was dry at that time (winter). The largest "fragment" was metallic, but most of the fragments were thin, porous limestone, whose nature was not immediately clear. Later, it was identified, and this will be discussed separately (see page 219). The next day, two highly qualified entomologists who had searched the area four days earlier arrived to inspect, collected more flies, and carefully collected as many container fragments as possible by melting the accumulated snow with hot water.

There was snow in the ditches, which can explain why the insects (sluggish in low-temperature environments) had been on the ground for more than a week and were still lingering in the vicinity of the fall. It can also explain why a large number of bird feathers were simultaneously dropped and remained in the same place. The appearance of these insects and spiders in this season is abnormal (see page 199), and in terms of insect species, there are also regional anomalies (see page 198).

The Chinese conducted standard bacteriological examinations and proved that the insects, spiders, and feathers all carried pathogenic anthrax bacilli (Bacillus anthracis) (Appendix 22).

The result of this U.S. aircraft drop did not cause anthrax to occur in the county and its vicinity.

From the above facts, the commission had no choice but to reach the following conclusion: on March 12, at least one U.S. aircraft used at least one specially made container to drop insects and spiders carrying anthrax bacilli in the vicinity of this small city in Liaodong Province, Northeast China.

Title: The Committee's Detailed Investigation into the U.S. Use of Bacteriological Weapons
Author:
Date: 1952-12-20
Page: 1

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 20th

The committee has thoroughly investigated numerous cases where American aircraft flew from across the Yalu River and returned, dropping various objects that were witnessed (Attachment 27). Local eyewitnesses immediately searched for the dropped items. Although no containers were found at the estimated drop sites, other items were discovered: mainly a large number of beetles—dried beetles (Ptinus fur) (common pests in granaries and other dry goods storage areas), or a large number of bird feathers. In some cases, a large number of houseflies (Musca vicina) unexpectedly appeared, which is abnormal for the season, as there was still snow on the ground. Seasonally, the appearance of beetles is not abnormal, but their large-scale appearance in the open and during the day is highly unusual from an ecological perspective. Chinese bacteriologists examined the dried beetles, feathers, and houseflies, finding that they all carried anthrax bacilli. Although the objects were different, the bacterial strains isolated from them all showed the same reactions in fermentation tests, which is an unusual and suspicious situation.

The committee has thoroughly questioned twenty-four witnesses, some of whom personally saw objects being dropped from aircraft. The Chinese air defense observation teams recorded all cases (Attachment 27), indicating that the intruding aircraft were mostly F/86 type fighters, with one exception being a B/26 type bomber. Once, several people saw an object resembling a large red hot water bottle drop and explode in the air about thirty feet from the ground with a "pop" sound, releasing a foul odor similar to burning animal hides and horns. Another valuable testimony mentioned that no containers were found at the estimated drop site, but a large amount of feathers were scattered by the wind, forming a triangular shape that gradually extended and expanded. In this case, the description of the container immediately suggested the self-destructing egg-shaped bomb used in Wanchien (Attachment 22 and page 219).

In many areas of Liaodong and Liaoxi provinces, evidence related to aircraft, containers, the appearance of biological organisms, and bacteriological examinations has been further enriched due to the specific and careful analysis of materials related to respiratory anthrax and hemorrhagic anthrax meningitis deaths (Attachment 27). Five cases were studied: a railway worker, a pedicab driver, a housewife, a teacher, and a farmer. The diseases suffered by these five individuals were all of short duration, and the results obtained by pathologists during autopsies and histological examinations were the same. The committee believes that none of these individuals had occupational exposure to anthrax. The factors causing two of the deaths were clearly dried beetles, while the factors causing the other two deaths were flies and feathers. The committee is highly satisfied with the diagnoses made by Chinese scientists and the evidence they provided. Additionally, questioning witnesses obtained

(Attachment 28) materials omitted in the documents (Attachment 27), namely: among these five victims, four did not use the generally accepted preventive methods during the mass capture of insects and collection of feathers, such as wearing masks to protect the respiratory tract, wearing gloves, and using tweezers to catch insects. Under a microscope, it can be seen that dried beetles are suitable for spreading anthrax through this pathway because their elytra have many brittle, chitinous spines that can be inhaled. This fact was overlooked in the documents.

Do not assume that deaths caused by objects contaminated with anthrax bacteria are limited to these few individuals. The five cases with precise pathological analysis are presented as examples. Previously, such diseases were extremely rare in this region, and only by clearly understanding this point can the significance of these five cases be fully appreciated. Statistical evidence (Attachments 27, 28) indicates that in Northeast China, not only typical skin or pustular anthrax has been extremely rare in recent years, but respiratory anthrax causing hemorrhagic meningitis has never occurred.

There have been proposals in the literature to use anthrax bacilli in bacteriological warfare, which is well-known. Although natural transmission between humans is rare, making natural outbreaks difficult to produce, this bacillus has a wide host range, high infectivity (if toxic), and high resistance to environmental conditions, among other "favorable" conditions, making it possible to inflict long-term harm on a region. Moreover, it should be noted that when infection occurs through the respiratory tract, it has a strong latent period. The victims mentioned here all appeared relatively normal until they suddenly collapsed, and within twenty-four hours or less, they died.

The infection of anthrax through the respiratory pathway, when linked to the U.S. research on bacteriological warfare, is of great significance. In the research results published by the Detrick bacteriological weapons factory in 1946 and 1947 (Attachments 27, 35), it was stated that new anthrax bacilli can be cultivated on artificial culture media, which not only have abnormally high toxicity but are also particularly suitable for transmission through the respiratory tract.

Based on the evidence presented and the in-depth, long-term questioning of many witnesses—including medical professionals and ordinary individuals—by the committee's representatives, the committee is compelled to reach the following conclusion: in many places in two provinces, various biological organisms carrying anthrax bacilli were dropped, causing many people to be infected with pulmonary anthrax, which had never occurred locally before, and hemorrhagic meningitis induced by it, resulting in death. There is no doubt that the eyewitnesses who saw the dropping of these contaminated objects were American aircraft.

The Dandong Incident (Cholera)

One of the incidents investigated in detail by the Korean Health Minister's committee was the case of deaths caused by cholera. These cases can be cited as examples of similar incidents that occurred in rural areas since February 1952 (Attachment 29). On May 16, someone heard an American aircraft circling for over an hour, as if its pilot was looking for something; the next morning, a rural woman found some straw bundles containing clams while picking grass on a hillside. She took some clams home and ate them raw with her husband; that night, both suddenly fell ill, and by the next night, both had died. Medical evidence indicated that the cause of death was cholera (Attachment 29). Militiamen found many bundles of clams on the hillside, which were examined by Korean and Chinese experts and found to be severely infected with cholera vibrios (Attachment 29).

The more closely the entire incident was examined, the more unusual it appeared. First, the appearance of such bacteria-contaminated marine mollusks on a hillside in a rural area could only be considered an extremely unnatural phenomenon. Moreover, from an epidemiological perspective, the deaths of the patients were also highly abnormal. The evidence presented led the committee to believe that cholera has never been an endemic disease in Korea; because in the past forty years, although there have been a few outbreaks, they could all be traced back to a port of entry. However, the site of this incident was a purely rural location. Moreover, in this century, there has only been one case of cholera occurring in Korea in May; it is rare for it to appear before August. Furthermore, the clams found also had several characteristics. In Korea, clams sold are usually not packaged in straw, their appearance season is about a month earlier (in fact, since the war, they have not been on the market); if someone were not bothered to place these small packages on various parts of the hillside, it would be difficult to explain why many of the clams' thick calcareous shells were broken.

When examining the nature of the site where the clams appeared, the sequence of events became clear. The place where the clams were found is about four hundred meters from the water pump station on the mountaintop and about one thousand meters from a series of reservoirs or spring pools. The water from here is distributed by the pump station to several villages and port cities along the coast, part of which is used for drinking. The day before the clams were found, the filtration plant next to the pump station was accurately bombed by an American aircraft, but the pump itself was not destroyed. The committee personally questioned local residents, whose testimonies (Attachment 30) indicated that during the second air raid, the night the clams appeared, it was dark and windy. All these facts clearly indicate that this was a meticulously planned attempt to contaminate the drinking water in the reservoirs. The main purpose of this plan was not achieved because the weather conditions on the night the clams were dropped prevented the pilot from finding these reservoirs. On that night, the water surfaces of these reservoirs could not be as bright as mirrors.

Although so, some may still wonder how a marine or at least a coastal bivalve mollusk could be considered suitable for contaminating freshwater to make the water source bacteria-infected. However, convincing evidence (Attachments 30, 31) not only reminded the committee that cholera vibrios are halophilic organisms but also informed the committee that there are Japanese research papers stating that marine bivalve mollusks are very suitable as culture media for these bacteria, thus clarifying the last link of how such bacteriological warfare plans are carried out. The clams slowly die in the non-osmotic freshwater, during which period this mollusk can serve as a natural culture vessel for cholera vibrios. After death, the released cholera vibrios can survive in freshwater for thirty days (Attachment 31).

Therefore, the committee could only reach the following conclusion: the U.S. Air Force, based on a meticulously planned scheme, first destroyed the Dandong filtration plant without damaging the pump, and then attempted to contaminate the drinking water reservoirs with cholera vibrios. This young couple, impoverished by the ravages of war, inadvertently ate these clams intended as dispersal media for bacteria, resulting in their deaths.

This case should be studied in connection with the evidence presented elsewhere in this report regarding the use of flies as artificial carriers of cholera bacteria (discussed elsewhere, see Attachments 4, 5, 6).

Types of Containers or "Bombs"

It is now time to pay attention to the containers or "bombs"—if this term is applicable to military equipment carrying a small amount of explosive or no explosive. At different times and places, especially near Shenyang and Pyongyang, the committee had the opportunity to carefully study various containers that carried biological objects from the air. The committee members were thus able to confirm many statements in the Prague documents and to conduct detailed studies of newer and more sophisticated methods. However, the committee's work was not made easier by this, because these new methods include "self-destructing containers," that is, these containers either self-explode into small pieces that are difficult to detect or these containers self-ignite and disappear after dropping their contents; this point will be clearer shortly. In addition, even in the Prague documents and even in the testimonies collected by the committee, there are still some unclear points, because even eyewitnesses who saw the containers being dropped did not necessarily find the containers, partly because they did not know exactly what they were looking for, and partly because even if they found them, their descriptions were not so detailed. The testimonies of captured U.S. Air Force officers, unfortunately, did not clarify this point. Their positions were pilots and navigators, and they could not obtain accurate and detailed knowledge about these bombs and containers. It must be remembered that in a lecture heard by the pilot (Quinn / Ashfork; see below page 226 and Attachment 38), it was clearly stated, "Our bombs are still in the experimental stage, and there are several types." Therefore, the content of this statement must be accepted with appropriate reservations.

Containers have different shapes and uses, probably to suit different purposes. In addition, biological agents for spreading diseases can be directly scattered in the target area. For convenience, we can start with the study of the completely containerless spray method and end with the study of self-destructing containers. Between these two, there are containers with and without parachutes that are not too special.

(1) Spray Method:

On page 4 of NCNA/85 (Report of the Investigation Team on U.S. Imperialist Bacteriological Warfare Crimes in Korea), it is mentioned that a Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier saw an American aircraft spraying insects at an altitude of three hundred meters in Cheorwon on February 11. Because American aircraft flew over and a large number of insects were found distributed in a rectangular area ten kilometers long and five kilometers wide on the snow, this fact can only be judged in this way. Four American airmen, in five separate lectures, all heard that the spray method could be used and would be used for bacteriological warfare. One of the prisoners drew a diagram of the sprayer installed in the aircraft in his statement (O’Neal, ISCK/4, Attachment 39); another prisoner's statement (Kniss ISCK/5, Attachment 40) mentioned that he heard the spray method would begin to be used in June. But O’Neal believed that the spray method had been applied at least since February 18. Therefore, the judgment of this Chinese volunteer soldier may be correct.

As for the types of insects sprayed, it can be said with certainty that fragile insects like mosquitoes are not suitable for this method of delivery, but in other discussions (Attachment 12), it is pointed out that fleas can be sprayed this way. Of course, this method can also be used to spray bacteria, viruses, and toxins.

(2) Non-explosive Objects and Paper Packets:

Several Prague documents mentioned the discovery of paper packets of various colors, from which insects crawled out. On February 11, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Cheorwon saw three American aircraft drop these non-explosive objects, and after searching, they found cylindrical yellow paper packets, twenty millimeters high and ten millimeters in diameter (SIA/1, P.6; SIA/4, P.5). Nearby, rectangular gray paper packets were found, 10×10×3 centimeters, containing insects as well. On March 4, an American aircraft dropped white paper packets in Pyongyang (NCNA/85 P.8). On March 10, brown paper packets were dropped in Changdo (NCNA/85 P.6). Two lectures heard by captured American airmen (Enoch/Wilson and Quinn/Ashfork, see below page 225) also mentioned the use of paper packets containing infected insects. Therefore, hard-bodied insects can be packaged in paper and dropped at low altitudes, and some empty paper packets may have fallen out from metal leaflet bombs or

"bombs" that exploded or opened in the air. We will now discuss these leaflet bombs.

(3) Various Timed Fuse Leaflet Bombs that Explode in the Air:

This type of container is the most mentioned in the published Korean and Chinese documents related to bacteriological warfare, and it is the most common type of container collected by the authorities of the two countries. The committee members saw many of these containers. The size and shape of these bombs are roughly the same as the ordinary 500-pound HE bombs of the United States, but their weight is probably only about 150 pounds, so they can be manually loaded onto aircraft (Attachment 41). They have a cylindrical top with a timed fuse. The top is a small cavity, below which is the cylindrical body of the bomb, divided into four compartments by three steel plates. The entire bomb can be split longitudinally into two halves, so that the half-shell mounted on hinges can be opened at any predetermined time, dropping the contents inside. In the lowest compartment, the bomb shape narrows again, forming a conical cavity, with four fins outside and a hole at the bottom of the bomb, through which a parachute can emerge if the bomb is equipped with one. In the several documents that have been published about this bomb

(NCNA/85, SIA/13, ISCC/4, etc.), the size of the bomb is described somewhat differently, but the bomb seen by the committee and described by the captured airmen is probably 1.4 meters long, 40 centimeters in diameter, the bomb shell is made of 3-millimeter steel plates, divided into four compartments, with a capacity of 72 liters. The timed fuse is approximately 7.6 centimeters long. The bomb shell is marked "Leaflet Bomb—500 Pounds—M105 LOT—U.S. Time (Fuse)—Empty," according to the description of the airmen (Attachments 37, 40). The bomb door opens at about thirty meters above the ground, spreading the contents inside over an area with a diameter of 100 meters.

A typical eyewitness report (NCNA/85, SIA/13) is that on March 26, a military doctor in Ningyuan saw an American aircraft circling overhead and then diving down to drop two bombs. These two bombs split open upon impact, creating an area densely populated with insects about 200 meters long and 100 meters wide, with the highest density of about 100 insects per square meter, with the bomb crater (about five inches deep) being the densest (NCNA/85 P.5). The committee had the opportunity to personally question many witnesses, most of whom were farmers. These witnesses found three such leaflet bombs in Longbai County, Liaodong Province, dropped by aircraft on March 27 and 31, surrounded by densely populated insects. In Pyongyang, the committee also examined the collected containers, listing them in detail as follows (Attachment 26):

(Attachment Table)

Only one point needs to be added: in the nine lectures heard by the four captured American airmen, each time they either detailed or briefly mentioned this type of container, and these four captured American airmen all believed that the bacteriological bombs carried on their aircraft and dropped by them were of this type (Attachments 37, 40).

As is well known, the international press has had public debates about the use of leaflet bombs as bacteriological containers, but the head of the U.S. Chemical Corps has stated that these bombs can be used to drop biological objects (SIA/9 P.1; NCNA/85, P.5; ISCC/4).

(4) Leaflet Bombs with Propellers that Explode in the Air:

This type of container is a modified version of the above-mentioned bomb. The fuse installed at the top of the bomb has a small rotating air vane or propeller, which, after rotating a certain number of times, will cause the fuse to explode. Before the committee began its work, all published documents did not mention this type of container, and no evidence of its use was found. However, in the lectures heard by the captured American airmen, it was mentioned that this type of container (O’Neal/McLaughlin, see below page 226).

(5) Leaflet Bombs with Propellers that Open the Bomb Door:

This type of container is similar in appearance to the two types mentioned above. The top of the bomb is equipped with a rotating propeller or air vane, which, after rotating a certain number of times, activates a mechanism to open a series of bomb doors. Thus, the bags inside are blown out by the wind. However, this type of container was not mentioned in the Prague documents. The committee did not find direct evidence of this type of bomb or its use. However, in the lectures heard by the captured American airmen, this type of container was mentioned

(Quinn/Ashfork, see below page 226).

(6) Leaflet Bombs that Open the Door or Split in Half Upon Landing:

The shock of the bomb landing causes the battery inside to generate electricity, activating a mechanism to open one half or a series of doors of this container. The plastic partition breaks, and the acid flows onto the metal plate, generating electricity. This was not mentioned in the Prague documents, and the committee did not find direct evidence of this type of container. However, in the lectures heard by the captured American airmen, this type of container was mentioned

(Quinn/Ashfork, see below page 226). This prisoner was later able to draw a diagram of it in his statement (Attachment 38). According to his description, this bomb must be equipped with a parachute, which is probably the container mentioned in the lecture for dropping infected insects with a parachute. (O’Neal/McLaughlin; Kniss/Holleman; Kniss/McLaughlin) One of these prisoners (Attachment 39) was also able to draw a diagram of the container with a parachute that he imagined.

(7) Paper Tubes or Hard Paper Tubes with Silk Parachutes:

The only container with a parachute seen by the committee is of this type, similar to a flare. It is a hard paper tube, one millimeter thick, thirty-six millimeters long, and thirteen millimeters in diameter. The box is marked (USCS/1-1-1952-LOT 100-F-6). The silk parachute attached to the paper tube has a diameter of only seventy millimeters. It has been pointed out that the size of this parachute is only one-thirtieth of the parachute of an ordinary flare (NCNA/85 P.5), so it can be inferred that it will not stay in the air for long. Moreover, it was pointed out that there were no signs of burning on the paper tube. Some of these paper tubes were examined by the committee and found to be so. Another important point is that once, when one of these containers was found, it appeared to have dispersed mosquitoes (Jangdong County, March 26, NCNA/85; SIA/13). This method is undoubtedly very convenient for dispersing fragile insects such as mosquitoes (ORTHOCLADIUS) or flies.

(8) Paper Containers with Paper Parachutes (Self-Destructing):

The committee did not see this type of container, and the captured American airmen did not mention it. However, in an article written by Lieutenant Colonel Akira Sakaki in the Japanese weekly "Shukan Mainichi" in January 1952 (Attachment 17), this type of container was described in detail. According to this article, this container is made of hard paper, divided into several compartments, with a weight to make it descend, and equipped with a fuse, which can make the container and the paper (or silk) parachute burn at the appropriate time. According to Sakaki, when the container lands and opens, it gently releases the biological agents (rats carrying plague bacilli), and after a sufficient time, the container and parachute catch fire and self-destruct, leaving no trace. This container is easy to modify, making it drop its contents at twenty to thirty meters above the ground, so the container itself is lighter, blown away by the wind from the area, and then burned to nothing. Sakaki specifically mentioned the use of this container to carry rats with plague bacilli, which makes one suspect that a large number of these containers were used in the Gannan incident (see page 208), but so far there is no definite evidence. In addition, if rats are loaded in paper containers, they must be kept in a semi-anesthetized state during the flight to prevent them from biting through the paper and escaping. The committee mentions this point only to draw attention to this possibility.

(9) Ceramic or Porcelain Bomb-Shaped Containers:

During World War II, the Japanese bacteriological warfare organization manufactured at least two sizes of ceramic (actually porcelain) bomb-shaped containers in a special factory near Harbin. The committee has studied these two containers in Shenyang (large ones about eighty millimeters long, small ones about fifty millimeters long). In Japan, it is still advocated to use this type of container to carry bacterial culture media, as mentioned in the above article by Sakaki (Attachment 17); however, the committee did not find evidence of the use of this container in Korea and China in 1952. The most sophisticated container developed based on this bomb is the "egg-shaped" container, which breaks into many small pieces upon landing, making it easy to be overlooked.

(10) Artificial "Egg-Shaped" Containers:

On March 21, more than two hundred pieces of limestone container fragments and a cap-shaped steel piece with a metal shaft in the center of its concave surface were found outside the city of Wanchien County, Liaodong Province. The situation on the ground (Report ISCC/3, Attachment 22) indicates that these things must be the remains of the container dropped by American aircraft on March 12, and there is reason to believe that houseflies, spiders, and feathers carrying anthrax bacilli were all carried in this container and dropped. These metal and limestone fragments have been thoroughly studied by the Institute of Modern Physics and the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the original shape of the container has been drawn.

Thus, it can be inferred that this container was probably cylindrical, with at least one end being dome-shaped. The total length of the container is approximately forty millimeters, the metal shaft is twenty-eight millimeters long (Attachment 22). The radius of the steel cap is twelve and a half millimeters; its diameter is seventeen and four-tenths millimeters; the radius of the limestone body is fourteen millimeters. The limestone shell is about two millimeters thick, and the outside of the body is coated with a layer of aluminum paint. X-ray examination shows that the main component of the shell is calcium carbonate. Spectroscopic examination shows that the main component of the shell is calcium carbonate, with a small amount of magnesium. The method of making this fragile calcium carbonate box and the organic matter used to bond the calcium carbonate particles is not fully understood. What is not clear is how such a fragile container can withstand the vibration when it leaves the aircraft.

The Wanchien incident (ISCC/3) has been partially mentioned in the SIA/3 document on page 2 and the SIA/8 document on page 6. The committee was able to examine the preserved carbon fragments, but the committee noted that this was not the only incident. As late as June 6, near Pyeongtaek in Korea, insects were found to have been airdropped, and at the same time, silver spheres about twice the size of a soccer ball were seen slowly descending from the air (Attachment 24). There will be no great doubt that this is the same type of container. In addition, the witness in the Bukchang incident (ISCC/5, SIA/6, page 1) testified that he personally saw an American aircraft drop a bright object. Flies carrying anthrax bacilli were also dropped in large quantities. Other testimonies also mentioned this type of container (SIA/10, page 1, Attachment 7), but it is not possible to confirm. In short, the committee believes that this type of container was used in March and June on both sides of the Yalu River, which is an undeniable fact.

(11) Various Types of Containers:

In addition to the various types of containers mentioned above, the evidence presented confirms that other types of containers were also used. There have been documents mentioning the use of iron wire cages (NCNA/85, page 5) and wooden boxes (ibid, page 6) to carry rodents. If these things were indeed dropped from the air, they were probably dropped together with parachute bombs and other things. In the Dandong area, clams carrying cholera bacteria were dropped using straw packages (Attachment 29). There are also documents (NCNA/85, page 6, SIA/13) mentioning hand grenade-shaped containers, but the committee did not see them. The committee members had the opportunity to examine fragments of green transparent insect containers in Pyongyang, which were fired as shells (NCNA/35, pages 5 and 6, SIA/13). The lectures heard by the captured airmen at least twice mentioned the participation of artillery in bacteriological warfare (Enoch/wilson and O’Neal/Williams, see below page 226); but the committee has never found evidence to prove the method of bacteriological warfare mentioned by Sakaki, that is, using mucus containing Weil's bacillus (gas gangrene) or tetanus bacilli to coat the surface of shells, which has actually been used (Attachment 17). Cotton used to make winter clothing was once found near the trenches of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and it was found to carry paratyphoid bacilli (with DGMS, CPVF correspondence).

(12) Distribution of Biological Agents Dropped on the Ground:

Anyone who reads the attachments to this report and the Prague documents can see that many witnesses often mention that the areas densely populated with insects are circular, with the fragments of leaflet bombs as the center. This can be said to be the place where the container exploded or opened in the air, with this as the center, the closer to the center, the denser the distribution, and the distribution is very regular.

In addition to the above cases, the committee also noted two interesting cases of the distribution of dropped objects on the ground. In one case (ISSC/5, Attachments 27, 28), feathers, after landing, were gradually blown open by the wind, forming a triangular area, about three-quarters of a kilometer long and less than one-third of a kilometer wide (widest point). This area gradually extended and expanded. Although no container or fragments were found, the bomb was probably egg-shaped. In another case (ISCK/3, Attachments 20, 21), a large number of human fleas were found on a hillside without trees, distributed in an elliptical area, approximately 30×10 meters, with the highest density at one of the two centers of the ellipse. From this situation, it can be inferred that the human fleas were dropped from a certain type of container, possibly a container with a parachute, which moved along the long axis of the ellipse.

Testimonies of Captured Spies

The Korean authorities informed the committee that since the outbreak of the war, spies have been sent to North Korea to investigate the situation of epidemics related to bacteriological warfare and report back. Many of these spies have been captured, and their confessions have greatly exposed the U.S. spy organization and the work this organization assigned to them. The details of a few spies have already been published, such as document SIA/7, which is a detailed account of a Chinese and a Korean spy.

The committee members had the opportunity to have a long conversation with one of these spies in Pyongyang (Attachment 36). This young man, who had not finished school, joined the "Youth Organization" of the South Korean government in 1945 and retreated with the U.S. military when they finally withdrew. His motive for opposing North Korea was personal gain, not political belief.

Unable to make a living, he joined the U.S. military auxiliary spy team. He recounted that from December 1951 to March 1952, he received political, military, and health training in a Seoul organization called "K.L.O." (Attachment 36). There, he was taught techniques for collecting intelligence. It was during this period that bacteriological warfare occurred. From around the beginning of February, he was given many immunization injections, although he was not told what was being injected. Until the night before he was sent out, he had not come into contact with foreign military officers, but the final instructions were given to him by an American lieutenant through an interpreter. He was instructed on where to operate and was given detailed information on what diseases (typhoid, plague, cholera, encephalitis, dysentery, and smallpox) the U.S. military wanted to know about. He was also told the method of compiling statistical data in North Korea and was instructed to, if possible, contact government health agencies and other agencies to obtain information, and if necessary, to steal. He was also told to be extremely careful about food, not to stay overnight in areas where insects had been scattered, and not to drink unboiled water. He was also told that North Korea was full of epidemics, but the injections he had received would give him great protection.

This witness, following the instructions, crossed the border into North Korea on March 29 and worked with a radio operator until he was captured on May 20. When answering the interrogation, he was quite silent, perhaps to protect his companions. He said that he tried to get close to the North Korean health personnel but was not very successful, so the information sent to the U.S. military headquarters was extremely limited, almost non-existent.

This witness said that before he illegally entered North Korea, he was not told that bacteriological warfare was being carried out. He only heard that there were many epidemics in the north and that the army in the south was "using the latest scientific weapons with good results." He saw the notices and only then knew about bacteriological warfare.

The entire committee unanimously believes that from the demeanor of this witness and his testimony about his mission and the instructions he received, it can be seen that his testimony is genuine, and he has not been subjected to any physical or mental coercion. In addition, from his performance, it can be seen that he is a self-seeking person. The committee believes that sending spies to investigate the situation of epidemics is not an implausible matter. The committee believes that the mission of this spy was to provide information on the effectiveness of bacteriological warfare. This conclusion is only an addition to the large amount of evidence that has already been accumulated to accuse the U.S. military of crimes.

Testimonies of Captured U.S. Airmen

On January 13, 1952, a U.S. Air Force B-26 bomber was shot down over Anju in Korea. On May 5, the navigator Inak and the pilot Quinn made long statements, admitting their participation in bacteriological warfare. Their testimonies have been published to the world by Beijing. These two documents are respectively found in the pamphlets printed in Prague (SIA/14 and 15), and there are photocopies of the originals. The relevant parts have been included in the appendix. Although subsequent interrogations did not add much technical and scientific evidence, documents SIA/17 and 18 should still be referred to (Attachments 37, 38).

What are the key points of the testimonies of these two airmen? First, both officers had heard secret lectures on bacteriological warfare methods in Japan and Korea. They were forced to listen to these two reports, which contained extremely secret content, discussing how to directly drop or spray bacteria, use insects to spread diseases (mechanically or biologically), use containers with parachutes to drop rodents, use poisoned food, and use infected shells. Various containers or "bombs" were mentioned, and diagrams of them were drawn. The correct height for dropping and the airspeed were mentioned. In Quinn's lieutenant's lecture, particularly important content included: (1) "Almost any insect can be used to spread disease" (i.e., mechanical transmission); (2) "Rodents can be dropped, although it is not necessary"; (3) Preparations were made for encephalitis, "because it has no reliable treatment."

Second, both officers received orders to carry out bacteriological warfare flights, although they were extremely unwilling internally but still executed the flight missions. The special bombs used had various characteristics and were often guarded by guards, not allowing the pilots to approach for inspection. In one report, it was explained which aircraft were most suitable for dropping which containers. According to the knowledge of these two airmen, many of their comrades also participated in bacteriological warfare flights, and they knew from subsequent conversations that many airmen had received bacteriological warfare training (SIA/17). Lieutenant Inak, when receiving the flight order, carried what was called a "bacteriological bomb," and Lieutenant Quinn, when receiving the flight order, carried what was called a "non-explosive bomb," but when they were ordered to report the flight results, they were only allowed to use the name "non-explosive bomb."

Undoubtedly, these two testimonies will have a great impact on Western countries. But those who do not want to believe will use the excuse that these testimonies were obtained through physical or mental torture, that only two people came out to testify, that perhaps there were no such two people, and that the testimonies were entirely fabricated;—they will use these excuses to dismiss these testimonies. However, attempts to find contradictions in Quinn's lieutenant's testimony have failed (SIA/16).

In this situation, it is extremely important that the committee was able to meet with the aforementioned two individuals and two other prisoners, Lieutenant O'Neil and Lieutenant Kniss, in a certain place in Korea (Attachments 39, 40). The testimonies of O'Neil and Kniss were longer and more detailed. When the committee saw these four American airmen, they seemed to have seen a cross-section of American life: one was a cool-headed electrical engineer, one was a middle-class businessman, one was a young chemist, and one was a strong steelworker from a farming family. The committee had the opportunity to have a long conversation with these four individuals in a free-talking environment. The committee members unanimously believed that these prisoners were not subjected to physical or mental pressure to make statements. They made statements voluntarily. The long-term friendly treatment of the Chinese and Koreans made them recognize their responsibility to all humanity, which should outweigh their concerns about exposing their government's military secrets. The committee's conversation with these airmen was mostly in the form of questions and answers, but each airman made a statement at the beginning of the conversation, the content of which was consistent with his written testimony, and finally solemnly expressed his belief that his conscience drove him.

Their statements (ISCK/4 and 5) and the evaluation containing the main content of this meeting, since they are all listed as attachments (Attachments 39, 40, 41), there is no need to elaborate here. But from their written statements and answers to questions, it can be understood what the U.S. Air Force was doing at the end of 1951 and the beginning of 1952. This can be seen from the following table:

June 1951—Kniss in the U.S. heard a lecture by Laurie, who talked about bacteriological warfare, saying that the enemy might use bacteriological warfare.

August 25—Inak in Japan heard a lecture by Wilson, who said that the U.S. had no plans to conduct bacteriological warfare, but the enemy might use it.

October—Inak in Korea heard a bacteriological warfare lecture by Browning, stating the same as above.

December 1—O'Neil in the U.S. heard a lecture by Williams, who did not confirm whether the U.S. would use bacteriological warfare.

December—Inak in Korea again heard a bacteriological warfare lecture by Browning, stating the same as before.

December 18—Quinn in Korea heard a lecture by Ashfork, who said that preparations must be made for bacteriological warfare, as the enemy might use it.

January 3, 1952—Quinn's first flight to drop bacteriological bombs, the order and report both said "non-explosive bombs," but he already knew from other circumstances what this "non-explosive bomb" was.

January 6—Inak's first flight to drop bacteriological bombs, the order said "bacteriological bombs," and the report said "non-explosive bombs."

January 22—O'Neil in Korea heard a lecture by McLoughlin, who definitely said that bacteriological warfare would be used.

February 15—O'Neil's first flight to drop bacteriological bombs, the order said "bacteriological bombs," and the report said "air-exploding timed bombs."

February 18—O'Neil saw evidence that a specially modified aircraft used the spray method to spread bacteria.

February 22—Kniss in the U.S. heard a lecture by Holleman, who clearly denied the use of bacteriological warfare but admitted that the U.S. possessed bacteriological weapons.

March 21—Kniss in Korea heard a lecture by McLoughlin, who definitely said that bacteriological warfare had been conducted since January 1 and that the U.S. government would continue to deny it as much as possible.

March 27—Kniss's first flight to drop bacteriological bombs, the order said they were "bombs to suppress anti-aircraft guns," and the report said "bombing results not observed."

From the above facts, it cannot be denied that the order to conduct bacteriological warfare against Korea and China must have been issued at the end of 1951, and in advance, airmen were made to listen to cautious, informative lectures to prepare them for bacteriological warfare without telling them what they were actually going to do, even after January 1952, until they actually arrived in Korea. In the U.S. and Japanese bases, bacteriological warfare was said to be theoretical and purely defensive; but when they arrived in the Korean base, the pilots were surprised to find that bacteriological warfare had already begun a few weeks or months before they arrived. These airmen did not overlook the fact that this overall order must have been issued during the armistice negotiations in Kaesong.

In addition, the testimonies of the airmen, who were questioned separately, are of great interest. It is noteworthy that none of them had ever received education on the laws of war and recognized customs, such as the prohibition of shooting prisoners, and they had not seen such regulations in their military manuals, nor had they heard that certain methods of warfare were illegal, at least considered illegal by some countries. Their testimonies all consistently indicated that the order to conduct bacteriological warfare had a very bad effect on the morale of their comrades. Among them, many who were already extremely resentful of being forced to slaughter Korean civilians in Korea could no longer bear it (Attachment 41). After being captured and disarmed, they were treated very kindly by the Koreans and Chinese, no longer seeing them as enemies, and their change of attitude is understandable.

These officers knew little about the types of bacteriological containers, which is not surprising, as they were all navigators and pilots, and the knowledge of the armament personnel would not be told to them, and they could only guess the source of the bacteriological weapons, with some believing it might come from Japan, which is very important.

In summary, after multiple meetings and personal contact, the committee has sufficient reason to believe that these non-commissioned officers are honest and fair. They appeared very normal and healthy, spoke naturally, and smoked and drank tea like the others present. The committee once again firmly believes that these airmen were not subjected to any physical or mental pressure, and the treatment they received fully reflected the highest noble tradition of Chinese humanitarianism. Therefore, the committee believes that the evidence of the airmen is true and reliable. This evidence, in many aspects, has further enriched the highly scientific and objective evidence obtained from on-site investigations.

Public Health in New China

The committee has a deep impression of the current health situation of the Chinese people and the various measures taken to improve health standards and resist the spread of epidemics. These measures are effective and thorough. There is a misconception in the West that the health situation of the Chinese people is poor; however, just by seeing the current situation and the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in carrying out the government's health instructions, it is enough to dispel this misconception

(Attachment 42).

The remarkable progress made in several years can be illustrated by a few figures. In Northeast China, 35 million rodents were exterminated in 1951, and 10 million were exterminated in the spring of 1952—such a campaign to exterminate rodents is unprecedented in the world. The campaign to exterminate flies and other disease-carrying insects has been carried out throughout the country. Beijing is now almost a city without flies and mosquitoes. Before liberation, there were few people who vaccinated against smallpox, and the efficiency was low, with the highest number of people vaccinated in one year (1946) not exceeding 7.3 million; but in the three years after liberation, 370 million people have been vaccinated against smallpox, so smallpox has almost completely disappeared. The reform of midwives has reduced the mortality rate of infants from tetanus by two-thirds from 1949 to 1951. During the same period, the general infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate were reduced by half. Many traditional Chinese doctors have been mobilized to assist in this great health movement, and it has been proven that they are willing and able to accept new medical education, enabling them to play a role. In Beijing and other large cities, stray dogs have almost disappeared because they are suspected of being reservoirs of encephalitis viruses and carriers of many infectious diseases.

In addition, the production of vaccines and serums by biological product factories has made significant progress in organization and production capacity. The committee visited such an institution in Beijing and was impressed by their work efficiency, high output, and high-level scientific research.

The health movement is not limited to Beijing or a few "model" cities. Reliable sources have told us that this movement has reached the most remote corners of this continent. This was personally seen by the committee during their travels in the Northeast. During this trip, the committee visited a remote place near the Inner Mongolia border in Heilongjiang Province. The committee was deeply impressed by the cleanliness of the villages.

Since liberation, China's health education movement has been extensive, perhaps unparalleled in the world. The entire population, regardless of gender, age, or status, has cooperated wholeheartedly, which is a necessary condition for achieving such results. All that needs to be done to continuously and rapidly improve public health standards has been thought of and done thoroughly and enthusiastically: such as clearing accumulated garbage, sweeping courtyards and wastelands, installing screens, catching various pests, producing and using insecticides and vaccines, etc. Various educational methods have been used to promote basic health education, such as: mass meetings, slogans, picture books, wall newspapers, newspapers, dramas, and films.

When faced with bacteriological warfare, even when it was initially suspected that it had occurred, the Chinese peasant masses already knew how to deal with it correctly, without any confusion or panic. After the committee members came into contact with Chinese witnesses from all sides, they could see that millions of people, under the guidance of the central and local health departments, acted in a disciplined manner, collecting and destroying any objects from containers dropped from the air in fields and streets.

Today, China's progress in health, the active implementation of various health measures, is exactly what successive international health organizations have advocated but failed to achieve. If the Chinese government could not obtain the unconditional support of all levels of people, it would not have made such great progress in such a short time. Chinese farmers and industrial workers, scholars, and religious groups all support the government's goals and contribute their greatest efforts.

Summary

It is now beneficial to compile some facts into tables. This includes not only the summarized facts published in the Prague documents but also the facts presented in June, July, and August for the committee to examine. Some more obvious events are listed in the attached table

(Attachment 7). Each case records the reference document number, date, location, and circumstances; whether aircraft were noticed; whether objects were seen falling; whether containers were found; and where abnormal concentrations of insects or other biological organisms were seen. If possible, the density of animal concentrations is also noted. Following this is the entomological or zoological identification, the results of bacteriological examinations, and epidemiological notes. It must be understood that this table only includes a small part of the known events.

From this summary table, it can be seen that after the appearance of biological objects carrying pathogenic bacteria is confirmed, there are not necessarily cases of infected individuals following. This is thanks to the people in the affected areas who quickly searched for and destroyed any abnormal animals or objects suspected of being airdropped. These operations were carried out so effectively that, as shown in the attached table, in many cases, it was even impossible to retain samples for bacteriological analysis. In other cases, bacteriological analyses were performed to check for certain pathogens, resulting in negative results.

It is worth noting that in this year, the number of times American aircraft invaded Northeast China is countless. Most of these invasions did not involve explosive bombing. Between February 29 and March 21, 175 groups of American aircraft conducted 955 attacks in Northeast China, including 70 counties in Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang provinces (SIA/3). Other similar figures have also been seen in documents (NCNA/85; SIA/13). The recent invasion of Chinese airspace has not only not decreased but has intensified. For example, in the eight days up to August 7, 79 groups of American aircraft conducted 398 sorties in Chinese airspace.

The geographical distribution of the incidents that occurred in Northeast China is interesting (see map in Attachment 7). In terms of incidents that have been analyzed in detail, by April, Liaodong Province had the most incidents (18), most of which are adjacent to the Korean border. The clear fact here is that almost all incidents occurred in areas near railways and roads. A similar characteristic can be seen in the eight incidents that occurred in the farthest province of Heilongjiang. Here, a railway forms a large S-shaped curve north of Qiqihar and Harbin, each side being more than 150 kilometers long—the incidents that occurred are all along this line.

Previously published documents, on the one hand, published detailed information on bacteriology and epidemiology, linking infected insects with cases of infected individuals; on the other hand, presented evidence linking the appearance of insects with the passage of aircraft. Sometimes the information provided by these documents is incomplete, which is one of the reasons the committee cooperated with Chinese and Korean scientists to conduct detailed questioning of various incidents; these incidents have been described in the previous sections, such as the Huaiyang, Gannan, Wanchien, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Dandong, and other incidents. In all investigations, it can be seen that the connection between aircraft, media, and cases of infected individuals is indisputable.

In the previous analysis of incidents, the method has been explained. Now is the time to compile the data from the most thoroughly analyzed cases into a table (page 232). Through this format comparison, an organized plan is clearly revealed. There is always someone who sees or hears aircraft, and their flight paths are often plotted; later, the statements of captured pilots add supplementary information. Then, there is the necessary information about the dropping of containers on the table, the media used, and their abnormal conditions, bacteriological tests, and clinical cases that follow.

Related to these facts, the committee heard and questioned many ordinary Chinese peasants. The committee members believe in the honesty and integrity of these witnesses, and their testimonies are frank and clear.

Turning to specific issues, the committee has considered whether Korean plague could have been introduced from the epidemic areas of Northeast China through traffic. There are several reasons to exclude this possibility. First, in the newly discovered plague areas in Korea and the aforementioned epidemic areas, there have never been reports of plague cases. Second, the occurrence of plague is highly abnormal in terms of seasonality (see Attachments 7, 18, and 19). Third, a characteristic of plague is that it always spreads among rodents before it spreads among humans, but no dead rodents were found in the Korean epidemic areas. Fourth, clinical results often have a clear connection with the media dropped by aircraft before the event. Finally, since the beginning, strict health and epidemic prevention work has been carried out at the border between China and North Korea.

Several diseases used not only affect humans but also livestock, such as anthrax (NONA/85 Attachment 27). After it was confirmed that some of the media dropped carried Pasteurella multocida, which causes hemorrhagic septicemia, it initially seemed unimportant because this is a common infection in laboratory animals. However, it is entirely reasonable to assume that it could be used as a weapon to kill livestock (Attachment 43).

Regarding cholera vibrios, although they were found in contaminated mollusks in the aforementioned cases that have been discussed in detail (Dandong incident), they have also been found in insects, especially in flies, more than a few times (Attachment 7). Salmonella and paratyphoid bacilli, as well as Shigella dysentery bacilli, are also found in some regions. In some regions, these bacteria were found in fly populations, but there were no cases of infected individuals. This raises the question of whether disease-causing bacteria could be present in or on ordinary flies collected at random. This question can be answered by referring to research published in Chinese medical literature many years before this war (Attachment 4). These documents indicate that during non-epidemic periods, ordinary flies do not carry typhoid bacilli, paratyphoid bacilli, or cholera vibrios. The attached documents include similar research records conducted in Shenyang this year.

(Attachment Table)

A related issue is the application of quantitative research methods to identify bacteria carried by insects; this material will be described in a separate document (Attachment 3).

Regarding the section on insect vectors of disease, it is necessary to supplement the information already mentioned in the Prague and other documents to make it more complete. One attachment (8) will specifically discuss the identification of insects that were dropped; another attachment (2) can help readers generally understand the issues related to medical entomology and bacteriological warfare.

In previous reports, there are some unresolved issues, especially regarding the incidents that occurred in Korea. Therefore, during the committee's stay in Pyongyang, a series of questions were raised to the Minister of Health, Lee Byung-nam, who promptly answered them (Attachment 9). It appears that the previous translations were somewhat incorrect. In the first Korean report (SIA/1), the character "蜱" actually refers to red mites (Trombicula akamushi). Regarding the same document's mention of flies parasitic on bats (Nycteribiidae sp.), qualified Korean authorities informed the committee that it is currently not possible to confirm that these insects are related to bacteriological warfare.

Regarding the multiple records of finding dead fish contaminated with Salmonella and Shigella on hillsides, confirmation has been obtained. The important fact is that these dead fish were all found near drinking water sources. Regarding this, one can recall the Dandong incident that the committee has studied in detail (Attachment 30), where the intention to spread cholera is clearly evident.

A question that has aroused the curiosity of Western scientists and is of serious concern to the committee is the issue of frozen dried protein substances found after aircraft flyovers (NCNA/85). This substance is in blocks, easily sticky and hygroscopic, and absorbs moisture when it falls on snow. Chemical analysis results indicate that it is a protein decomposition product—? , peptone, and vitamin—made. Bacteriologists isolated dysentery bacilli that can ferment mannitol from here. During the committee's work in Korea, such incidents did not occur, so it had to rely on Korean work reports; however, it believes that the judgment accepted by the Minister of Health is entirely possible, that is, this object is the frozen dried bacterial culture that was dropped.

Regarding the issue of spreading insects in very low-temperature environments, the committee points out that in the testimonies of captured airmen, they provided evidence of methods to produce insects with enhanced cold resistance (Attachment 39).

In the previous section (page 198), the description and dissemination of eighteen species of insects and spiders by aircraft were mentioned. Among them, nine species have been bacteriological examined and confirmed to be infected with pathogenic microorganisms. What about the other species? The committee cannot conclude that they are completely uninfected. When no one knows exactly what to examine, it will be very difficult to isolate pathogenic microorganisms from objects, especially when the objects are artificially selected bacteria and viruses. There are many possibilities that have not been considered.

The U.S. literature on bacteriological warfare is at odds with the events that occurred in Korea. Some views published in these works, before being eliminated, are difficult to reconcile with the committee's observations. It appears that in some important cases, technological progress has made these views outdated. The plague case can be considered typical. Ten years ago, Rossbury cautiously expressed the opinion that plague could be effectively spread for use in war; however, it could only be used in areas far from the front line because there was a great danger of infecting friendly areas as well. In Korea, the committee's investigation showed that plague had been spread more than once in areas not far from the front line, which is contrary to the opinion of the former commander of the Detrick camp, an experienced bacteriologist. However, this contradiction is only superficial. In the past ten years, disinfection technology has made great progress; on the one hand, new, more powerful insecticides, formulated into various mixtures; on the other hand, using high-efficiency hand-cranked machinery, large amounts of mist-like substances can be sprayed in a short time to carry out disinfection, and the simplicity of these machines can be used by an ordinary person. They are evolved from the smoke screen dispersers invented during World War II.

Actual experience has proven that these methods can be used to eradicate insect-borne diseases in an entire region. Recently published materials indicate that the U.S. military in Korea has such equipment and emphasizes its importance because

"In any future war, ordinary and normal methods may not be sufficient to cope with the situation."

These records are sufficient to explain the surface contradiction between literature and on-site facts. Even if only partially, they can be applied to all other diseases transmitted by infected insects and help explain the general trend of using insect vectors seen in Korea. The examples given are typical; we cannot limit the possibility of bacteriological warfare to the outdated views in natural conditions, the range that can be achieved by technological and scientific progress has been expanded; and, like the current example, it also explains the surface contradiction. In Korea, the U.S. side almost completely controlled the spread of disease-carrying insects, which shows that the reserved views in the literature are wrong. For the same reason, the committee disagrees with the opinion that using bacteria, viruses, and toxins in mist spraying is the only effective method of bacteriological warfare. Therefore, the experience of the Japanese (refer to above page 195) can now be used at a new level.

However, one of the cases investigated by the committee is the encephalitis that occurred in Shenyang and Anshan in Northeast China (SIA/3; 8; 00010), which shows that the virus may have been directly spread by the spray method. Regarding this incident, the committee was unable to reach a definitive conclusion because the actual relationship between the disease and the air raid could not be established. However, the evidence is confusing, so all relevant documents are placed in the attachment

(ISCC/6 32, 33, 34, 35).

The committee cannot provide specific numbers to the world: the total number of civilians killed in Korea and China, the total incidence rate, and the mortality rate, etc. It is inappropriate to do so because that would provide the party responsible for the incident with the final important information. For the committee to be invited to provide expert opinions to prove the case, these data are not necessary. What needs to be known is that the committee has confirmed: in individual locations and epidemic areas, many people have died under extremely abnormal conditions, ultimately due to the activities of the U.S. Air Force. It is important for the world to be alert to the facts that have occurred and are continuing to occur. The world's people must pay attention to the potential of such warfare and its almost incalculable danger.

Conclusion

Since early 1952, extremely abnormal phenomena have occurred in North Korea and Northeast China, leading the people and governments of the two countries to accuse the U.S. military of conducting bacteriological warfare. The International Scientific Committee organized to investigate the facts related to bacteriological warfare has completed its work after more than two months of on-site investigation.

A large amount of evidence is presented to the committee, some of which is coherent and highly explanatory, serving as examples. Therefore, the committee has focused on studying these facts.

The committee has reached the following conclusions: the people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed become targets of bacteriological weapons; the U.S. military has used these bacteriological weapons in various ways, some of which appear to be developments of the methods used by the Japanese military during World War II.

The committee reached these conclusions through logical steps. Such inhuman means, which have been unanimously condemned by the people of all countries, have been used, which is what the committee members previously found hard to believe; now, compelled by the facts, the committee must reach these conclusions.

Now, the people of the world must redouble their efforts to prevent the world from being ravaged by war and to stop scientific inventions from being used to destroy humanity.

    序言
    自从一九五二年年初以来，在朝鲜北部和中国东北发生了具有反常性质的现象，使这两国的人民和政府声称他们已成为细菌战的目标。
    全世界的人民，久已表示对这种战争方法的反对甚至憎恶，所以，局势之严重性，人所尽知。因此成立了一个国际科学委员会，前往现场调查事实。
    委员会的委员们，认识到他们的责任之重大，尽力摆脱先入之见，以最高度的客观态度，遵循他们所知道的最严格的科学原则，从事调查。
    这个报告，把工作的详细内容以及从而得到的结论，提供于读者之前。
    这个报告是经过八种语言的合作而写成的，因此，不拘泥于文字风格，而力求其清楚明确，使全世界各地人民都能懂得。
    委员会的组织与工作
    一九五二年二月二十二日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永先生，和三月八日，中华人民共和国外交部部长周恩来先生，正式抗议美国进行细菌战。二月二十五日，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若博士向世界和平理事会提出了控诉。
    一九五二年三月二十九日，在奥斯陆世界和平理事会执行局会议上，郭沫若博士在随行的中国代表们的协助之下，并有朝鲜代表李箕永先生在场，向执行局的委员和其他国家的代表们提供了许多有关本问题的资料。郭博士声明中国与朝鲜两国政府认为红十字国际委员会不能充分摆脱政治偏见，以进行现场的公正调查。但是，两国政府完全希望邀请一个由公正而独立的科学家所组成的国际团体到中国亲身调查控诉所依据的事实。不论他们与争取和平的机构有无关系，但他们当然是以献身于人道事业而知名的人士。这个团体的任务是证实或否定这些控诉。经过仔细讨论之后，执行局一致通过决议，组织这样一个国际科学委员会。
    奥斯陆会议之后，立刻努力邀请相当数目的自欧洲、南美洲与印度的，尽可能征求有关部门中有名的科学家们，在他们初步接受邀请之后，中国科学院近代物理研究所所长、兼中国人民保卫世界和平委员会委员、并在奥斯陆会议后留在欧洲负责组织委员会工作的钱三强博士，即以中国科学院院长兼中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若博士的名义发出请柬。六月中旬，委员会人数达到了不可少的最低限度，他们就由钱博士陪同起程到中国来。
    国际科学委员会的委员们在六月二十一日及二十八日先后抵达北京，他们在北京受到中国科学院与中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的热烈欢迎。委员名单如下：
    安德琳博士（瑞典），斯德哥尔摩市立医院管理处中央临诊试验室主任。
    马戴尔教授（法国），格利农国立农学院动物生理学研究室主任，曾任联合国善后救济总署牲畜专家，意大利及西班牙畜牧学会通信会员。
    李约瑟教授（英国），皇家学会会员，剑桥大学生物化学系威廉·邓爵士讲座的讲学者，曾任重庆英国大使馆（科学）顾问，联合国教育科学文化组织自然科学部主任。
    欧利佛教授（意大利），布罗尼大学医学院人体解剖学教授，前土伦大学普通生物学讲师。
    贝索亚教授（巴西），圣保罗大学寄生物学教授，前圣保罗省公共卫生局长，罗西佛及拍拉巴两大学医学院名誉教授。
    茹科夫·维勒斯尼科夫院士（苏联），苏联医学科学院副院长兼细菌学教授，曾任伯力日本细菌战犯审讯的首席医学专家。
    虽然我们对希望其参加的科学界知名之士不能前来很是遗憾，但委员会仍规定了七月十五日为最后报到的一天。可是我们对后来的
    葛拉求西博士（意大利）意大利罗马大学微生物研究所助教表示热诚欢迎。他于八月六日在委员会自沈阳回来之前到达北京。因为他只能在委员会最后三周的工作中出席，所以他的地位是“列席顾问”，在这个职位上他对于会议的进行有很大的帮助（见附件四十四）。最后还有
    钱三强博士（中国）中国科学院近代物理研究所所长参加。他代表郭博士陪伴委员会自欧洲到北京。他经中国方面根据委员会一致的邀请任命为联络员，在委员会讨论时可以发言，但没有投票权。
    这个团体又包括：
    可华司基先生：系茹科夫·维勒斯尼科夫院士的翻译秘书。
    贝索亚夫人：贝索亚博士的翻译秘书。
    国际科学委员会尚有中国方面成立的招待委员会的协助。这个委员会是由下列人士所组成：
    主席：
    李德全夫人中国红十字会主席暨世界和平理事会理事
    副主席：
    廖承志先生世界和平理事会理事
    贺诚医师中华医学会名誉理事长
    秘书长：
    宫乃泉医师上海医学院院长
    副秘书长：
    计苏华医师中华医学会秘书
    专家联络员：
    钟惠澜博士北京人民医院院长、中国协和医学院内科临诊教授
    吴在东博士南京大学医学院病理学教授
    方纲教授中央卫生研究院微生物学系副研究员
    朱弘复博士中国科学院昆虫研究室副主任
    严仁英博士北京大学医学院妇产科副教授
    杨士达博士上海震旦大学医学院公共卫生学教授兼院长
    在旅途中招待委员会的各位都是伴随着本委员会，无论是在危险或困难情况中，他们都是经常的尽力完成当时情况所需要的各项联络工作。招待委员会的专家与其他中国的科学家与医学家都常列席本委员会的各种集会并且作证。委员会对上述各位同道深致谢意并对他们的科学上的造诣与忠诚深致敬仰。
    关于委员会开会的情况，会议主席由各委员们依次轮流担任。马戴尔先生被选为科学秘书。委员会第一次会议于六月二十三日在北京进行。所有的会议日程简表列于附件一。
    委员会的一般工作都是紧密的与中国中央卫生部、沈阳东北区卫生部及朝鲜保健省各部长及其秘书处保持连系。它当然获得了与本问题各方面有关的许多科学家们的帮助。除上面已提到的人员外，委员会愿对中国东北人民政府卫生部王斌部长与白希清副部长表示谢意。他们总不怕麻烦地把他们能供献的材料尽力供给委员会。同样也应感谢朝鲜保健相李炳南和副保健相鲁振汉。虽然处在各方面都有困难及有严重空袭危险的环境中，他们冷静处理各项事务，这些著名医务人员的精神令人钦佩。
    在这方面，委员会很荣幸地会见了很多的朝鲜细菌学家与其他专家，并对他们忠心的为祖国服务，表示深切的敬佩。委员会并对三位在工作中牺牲了他们的生命的最优秀的朝鲜细菌学家表示敬意。尤应记载的是志愿防疫检验队的著名中国专家们如陈文贵博士、魏曦博士及何琦博士。他们乐意地离开了远在中国的安静的实验室而愿与朝鲜人民在反细菌战前线上一同遭受困难与危险，这种忘我的精神是值得称赞的。
    委员会有各种不同性质的会议，有时全体委员用很多钟点密谈科学上的问题，有时中国的专家亦在场参加，有时则必须用一个大房间以便听取很多不同职业的人证。在人证之中有一个被俘的特务（附件三十六）和四个被俘的美国空军人员（附件三十七至四十）。我们随时授权二人或三人的小组，连同中国同道（专家）共同研究特殊的问题。以后向委员会报告。我们常常把整天的时间消耗在北京、沈阳和平壤的实验室里，在这里中国和朝鲜的科学家将他们研究的结果详细地给我们看。在需要的时候委员会的委员们利用了北京和沈阳的很好的图书馆。
    中国和朝鲜专家们所准备的关于这些案件的材料成为本报告的全部附件。在下文对于这些附件，将有简单的叙述。必须知道，它们不是个别的案件，而是大量资料中的一些例子。此处提出的例子中国的比朝鲜的多，这是因为朝鲜人是在比较很困难的情况下工作，又因委员会在朝鲜工作时间较短而又实在处在一个特殊困难的时期。
    同时委员会觉得必须熟悉本年初期由布拉格发出的文件中所根据的原始科学记录。这些文件应尽可能的加以证实或否定。把这些文件弄清楚的确是必需的；因为在这些文件中发现了误解，后来被撤回的临时鉴定，以及完全翻译上的错误。从许多的附件中，可以看到委员会在这方面做了许多工作，而委员会通过这些工作而得的总的结论，在事实上，是证实了从布拉格发出的从前几个调查团的报告的主要论据。
    委员会的主要旅行如下：从六月二十三日至七月九日在北京把主要的线索加以清理后，到沈阳并在此处从七月十二日工作至二十五日，以后由招待委员会陪伴过鸭绿江到朝鲜北部，并从七月二十八日至三十一日在平壤开了多次会议（除了因空袭而间断之外）。在八月六日再回中国的东北之前，委员会用两天的时间在某地和被俘空军人员会晤过。应该指出，这一个旅行的组织在技术上是无可訾议的。
    还有比这个早而需时较短的旅行是在七月十五与十六两日举行的。委员会乘专机专车和吉普车到齐齐哈尔，并由拉哈转到甘南县的附近村庄，这些村庄，就是散布被鼠疫杆菌感染的小田鼠的现场
    （见附件十三）。这些地方是在黑龙江省内，靠近内蒙古的边境。其他正式的旅行是比较次要的。
    很重要的一点必须说明，像本委员会这样的组织，必然要遭遇到许多语言上的困难。委员会的委员讲七种不同的语言，但为多数所运用和了解的是法文，因此法文被采用为工作语言。凡用俄文，英文和意大利文时，立刻译成法文，在中国方面，许多中国科学家能说流利的英文或法文，使工作的进行有了许多的便利。但在会议上他们都讲中文，立刻分别译成法文。法文翻译者为杨士达博士及丁骥千先生，俄文翻译者为陈述医师，英文翻译者为严仁英博士。在工作的后期吴恒兴博士在文字和语言上给了很宝贵的帮助。本委员会还有一个有利条件，即委员会中有一人能说与听懂中文，这特别在与证人接谈时有用，他并能阅读与写作中文，因此在阅读参考文献与审查证件时，亦较方便。另一个委员兼通英俄两种语言。在朝鲜的情形更为复杂，因为很少中国的科学家能听懂朝鲜语，但本委员会幸而获得了玉仁燮医师，一位杰出的语言家的帮助，他能够把朝鲜语很正确的译成法文、英文和中文。还有其他朝中文的翻译员。同时并另由朝鲜语文先译为中文后转译为一种欧洲语文，并由朝鲜语文直接译为俄文，作为平行的对照。因时常校对笔记之故，可以见到在内容上很少有错误的可能。最后，有些会议的进行并有录音记录，可供以后的参考。由于以上的理由，本委员会认为它不致于因语言的困难而不能完全地理解中国及朝鲜专家和证人的意见。
    下面签署的委员会委员的名字附有签署者的资历及专长的学问。他们将各方面的经验在长时间的繁复广泛的讨论中汇集起来。在全部事项中仅仅需要科学方法的知识和了解时，每人都有同等的供献；当问题不在他们自己专长的范围之内时，他们信任资历更好的委员们底批判和解释。因此本报告是一件真正集体工作。
    委员会的委员们曾亲自看见和听到许多事情，因此对于这些事他们负有人证的责任。此外，委员会必须依靠朝鲜和中国的文件。虽然毫无理由可以怀疑中国和朝鲜医务人员及其他科学家们的能力与诚实，但是委员会还是采取了一切的谨慎态度。委员会在进行分析案件时未尝松懈过，而且在可能时还冒着最大的困难，直接深入与原来事实接触。委员们都使他们自己警惕着，不受任何政治的，伦理的或感情的影响，因此委员会的工作是在一种冷静的科学的客观的气氛中进行的。委员会最后的信念自然在某种程度上要依靠数百人证，这些都是它曾经接谈和询问过的。他们的证辞是那么简明、一致、而又独立的，因此是无可置疑的。
    在本报告的叙述里，显然不可能在每一句话里都写上它所依据的朝鲜的或中国的证据。委员会的委员们亲自进行的试验、检查、询问等等，一般地都在主文里提到了。在所有的案件中，其全部的详细资料都放在有关的文件和记录里面，这些参考附件都标示出来。
    凡在文件中曾经提起的中国和朝鲜科学家们的详细资历都记录在最后的一个附件里（附件四十六）。
    文件
    当委员会的委员们最初集合的时候，他们所能得到的文件，是中国政府宣布过、而由世界和平理事会设于布拉格的书记处在西方各国家中所散发的，或经由在各国的中国官方通讯社所散发的。
    朝鲜保健省的第一个报告（SIA/1），是讲到
    一九五二年一月份至二月份的事件。这个报告所包含的材料，再度被国际民主法律工作者协会调查团报告书中整理过。这一报告书（SIA/4），增加了朝鲜发现鼠疫的资料，当然还有这批国际人士亲自询问人证的结果。
    两个最详细的报告，是中国的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”三月间在朝鲜和中国东北进行调查的报告书。这两个报告中之主要者，是该调查团朝鲜分团的报告，四月间在北京印出，全文由新华社发表（NCNA/85），其摘要见于SIA/13。东北分团的报告，亦在北京印行，其摘要见于SIA/3。这个报告，包含充分的昆虫资料。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团关于同一内容的报告，并没有增添具有严格科学意义的新的东西，该报告在北京印出，SIA/8刊登全文。
    与世界和平理事会书记处合作的某些欧洲科学家组成的委员会的特别报告，以照片证实昆虫的鉴定，包括了朝鲜及东北方面的材料，见于SIA/2。由四位中国科学家根据同一材料而写成的另一特别报告，见于SIA/12。
    谁愿意研究早期报告的话，最好是按照上述的次序研究。但是国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的团员们在四月中旬返回欧洲的时候，有许多新的、用打字机打出来的副本，已准备好给他们带回去，特别是十件重要的案件；但是在当时尚未经充分分析。因为这些案件材料的编号是○○○○一至○○○一○，我们称之为“四零案件”。
    其余的材料，虽然法律的与个人的性质较为浓厚，但决不是没有科学的意义。证人的证辞，有一些是关涉到已在他处述及的案件（如○○○○五），都收集于SIA/6与10。美国战俘和间谍的供词，收集于SIA/7。有许多文件是美国空军俘虏的详细供词（SIA/14，15，17，18），这些供词原文已有了照相本，由世界和平理事会五月间印出。关于细菌战的各种报纸的剪摘已收集在SIA/5。
    〔注〕用下列代号代替各文件来源，SIA布拉格文件；NCNA新华通讯社；ISCC中国供给国际科学委员会的各种文件；ISCK朝鲜供给国际科学委员会的各种文件。
    第二次世界大战中日军进行细菌战的有关材料
    日本无疑的曾在第二次世界大战期间对中国实施过细菌战，在东亚对细菌战进行调查时，就没有办法不认定这个事实。委员会对这个问题比较熟悉，因为有一位团员曾经是伯力法庭审判的一个首席专家，另外一个是在事情发生的期间供职于当时中国政府的少数西方科学家之一。在一九四四年他的任务之一就是向他自己的政府报告：虽然在起初曾采取很怀疑的态度，但是当时中国军医署所搜集的材料似乎清楚地说明了日本人在几个地区内撒布了传染有鼠疫菌的跳蚤。这样他们就能在原非疫区，但其条件适于传播的地方，引起相当数目的腺鼠疫病例。如所周知，在通常的情况下，腺鼠疫只在某些局限性的地区内流行（例如福建省），在这些地区以外一般地是不蔓延的。
    委员会的面前有一份从中国卫生部的档案中检出来的报告的原稿，其内容就是关于日本人于一九四一年在湖南常德人工造成鼠疫的事件（附件十一ISCC/1）。这个文件在今天仍有相当的价值并且具有历史上的意义。中国官方的记录举出被日本人这样攻击的县城有十一个，浙江有四个，河北与河南各有两个，山西，湖南和山东各有一个。中国人认为在一九四○到一九四四期间遭受人工散布的鼠疫危害的人，约有七百人。
    再则，下面提出的文件具有历史的价值。据报，中国军医署当时曾将该文件十份分发给在重庆的大使馆，并且，根据一九四六年六月有名的默克（ME RCK）报告书，美国大规模的细菌战方法的研究也是在同一年，即是一九四一年开始的。此事绝非偶合。委员会很高兴在朝鲜的工作中，有机会和著述常德备忘录的杰出鼠疫专家会见，并听取他的陈述，指出国民党在第二次世界大战的终了时，纵然手边具有这些证据，却不加以追究（见附件十二）。如众所周知，他的结论后来为伯力审判的被告供词所完全证实了。
    “前日本军人被控制备并使用细菌战”案件之资料（莫斯科，一九五○）的发表，给全世界供给了关于日本细菌专家石井四郎（可惜他本人没有到案）指导下进行的实际工作的丰富材料。确切无疑地，曾使用大量生产细菌技术，生产霍乱、伤寒和鼠疫等细菌浆液，一次以百公斤计。也曾使用过相当简单的技术，来繁殖大量的鼠类和跳蚤，但实际上好像是只撒布了后者。还有，不同的证人随时都能引经据典地说出日本人那一天曾到过其在中国的基地，检查曾经实施过的散布方法。里面还揭露了许多关于秘密部队（如臭名昭著的“731”）和他们的实验室，实验性的制造厂，以及监狱的详细材料；在这个监狱里爱国的中国人和俄国人被冷酷地当做了实验动物（第一百零六页）。（新华社注：此为原“报告书”页码，下同。）在工作进行中委员会曾有机会检查过几个残余的陶质的“炸弹”，这种“炸弹”，是在哈尔滨一个特设的工厂里给石井制造的。这将在后面讲到。
    看起来，日本军阀们始终没有放弃过想一般地以生物武器，而尤其借撒播昆虫的武器来达到征服世界的目的。在他们撤出大连以前，他们有系统地从大学和各学系的图书馆的书刊里将一切有关细菌战的文献都撕掉了。不应忘记，在一九五二年初开始指责美军在朝鲜和中国东北进行细菌战以前，报刊上就发表过消息，揭露石井四郎曾到南朝鲜去了两次，三月里他又去了一次。是否在日本的占领当局曾鼓励了他的活动，是否美军远东司令部正在沿用日本式的方法，这都是委员会的每一个委员所不能不思考的。
    委员会分析事件的方法
    由于细菌战的特殊性质，要对进行细菌战加以证明是很困难的。例如完全的证据须有：一架飞机被迫降落，其所装载的生物物体须是完好无损，航空员们随即承认他们的行为，等等。很明显地，由于很多原因，这种情形是难以发生的。因此就有必要想出一种方法，将许多事情联系起来，使之首尾连贯，彼此能够印证，而构成一个有证有据的案件。所以，为了委员会的思考和工作，首先需要一种格式，能够成为在每一个专案事实的研究时的架子。
    最简单的格式，在理想的情况下，其每一个组成部分都有：
    （附图表）
    自然，这样的一全套是很难碰到，甚至永远不会碰到。但是，有一些案件很接近完整，因而足以做出决定。这样就能够将使用这些方法的人们的活动联系起来，并说明这些活动所产生的效果。委员会因此对那些具有说明性的事实，特别注意。错综复杂的事实加以研究，整个的情况就清楚了（参看第二百三十二页）。
    布拉格文件中有关昆虫学方面的资料
    委员会在北京开始工作时，摆在他们面前的许多首要工作之一，就是有次序的研究布拉格文件所根据的科学资料，而这工作的开始第一步就是与中国科学院及别的机构的中国科学家们一同把他们所鉴定的昆虫学上的证据，列制成表。委员会很快地就认识了中国科学家们的毫无疑问的高度才干（附件八）。并且，他们具有广大的图书馆便利，包括不同机关间的迅速转借制度，和许多保存得非常有条理的昆虫标本。唯一实际而仍不能克服的困难，就是虽已经过半世纪的工作，然而许多种昆虫的系统的分类，仍不完全明了。因此对于新输入的昆虫不能全部确实断定它们果否如是而来，而委员会必须事实上满足于某些案件中某种种类的昆虫曾成群的出现，至少在当地记载上以往并未有过的地区。
    美国飞机飞过后，送到中国专家经鉴定其科属分类而认为是典型代表性的反常的昆虫样品标本，已制成表（附件八）。这包括九种双翅目的（六种蝇及三种蚊和摇蚊）一种属襀翅目的，一种属粘管目的，一种属微翅目的，三种直翅目以及二种蜘蛛纲。连下面将提及的一种甲虫，共十八种。
    在欧洲发布的文件中曾给人印象，是以为某些被发现的昆虫简直在亚洲大陆有关地区上，不但是种，而且连其属都从未见过；但这点并未证实。虽然如此，在三个案例中有很明显的在这方面的反常现象。在所收集的许多虫群中，经过多次鉴定的Hylemyia属的黑蝇，已被确实证明与在中国东北常见的四个品种都不相同，并且和中国各地以往所记载的十五种都不相同。可是这一属把全世界各个部分都计算在内，共有六○○种，而它们的所属地区情形迄今尚不能完全明白（附件八）。与这相似的，是所获得的粪蝇（Helomyza modesta； Meigen）是确实与中国以往所记载的这个属中唯一的品种也不相同（附件八）。对摇蚊（Orthocladius），情况也是如此。这种动物学和地理学上的差异，在考虑各项证据时，必须给予适当的重视。
    无论如何，生态学方面的反常性比动物学和地理学方面的更属特异。姑勿论各个种别对当地是陌生或并不陌生，然而在一年的头三个月中，那时中国的东北和朝鲜地上尚有积雪，而竟发现大批的虫群，这确是十分奇特的。委员会毫无疑问地可以证明这些虫群会为许多不同阶层的普通男女们所看见
    （以及尽可能的很快的将其消灭）。在已经提及的十八种别中，至少有十二种在出现的季节上显然是反常的。换言之，其过早地大量出现，据有资格的昆虫学家们个人经验和所发表的文献，它们的出现比每年正常出现的时间早了六周到十四周。平均提早九个星期——超过两个月（附件八）。
    在这儿有几个有趣的问题发生了。收集几万个与家蝇大小相同的蝇子是很容易想像的。可是雪蚤或弹尾虫（Isotoma Iegishina； Borner）是那么小
    （只二毫米长），必须有巨大数目在密集的浓度下，才能引起人们的注意（附件八）。尽可能的密度估计的具体数字已列于表上（附件七）。在SIA/12内，中国昆虫学家们中有一位进行了一个重要的观察，某些出现在温度零下一○度（摄氏）的黑蝇（Hylemyia）中有大部分即将产卵，因此使它们的来源的神秘性更深了一层。同样可惊异的是油葫芦（Gry llus testaceus）的事件，而在一九五一年，在北京适有一篇很完备的论文讲到它的生活史
    （附件八）。成千的这种成虫发现在三月里的东北辽东省的宽甸附近。可是在这季节里，就是在气候比东北暖和的北京，这种昆虫也在卵生阶段，是绝不会有成虫出现的。
    姑且承认说有关各种昆虫在冬天出现的个别和散见的例子，在昆虫学文献中是可以找到。可是，这许多种别的昆虫同时出现，这现象，如果说是完全由于自然的原因，那就很难令人置信了。委员会肯定，去年冬天在中国东北及朝鲜的气象情况是完全正常的（附件八）。所以无怪乎中国人和朝鲜人把这些反常现象与美国飞机的飞过，尤其是与多次被人看见的美机掷下不爆炸的物体的事实相连系起来。委员会与许多目睹这些现象的证人作了会谈
    （附件二十二、二十五及二十八），并证实了他们的诚实和可靠。我们将可以看到，许多普通的和极特别的容器已被发现了（参看第二百一十五页），并且经过一番研究。可惜的是送到欧洲去的某些文件
    （例如四零文件）中，对事前有飞机飞过这个紧要的说明被省略，可是委员会把这主要的一点弄清楚了（附件七）。
    另一种论据，承认相当数目的昆虫种类的出现季节，确实是提早了；但坚持说，即使这并不能归因于气候上的反常情况，但有某些自然因素发生作用，因而有规则地将所有现象都同样地提早了。幸而试验这一点是很容易的。只要将各种昆虫按照它们正常出现的次序加以排列，然后再将它们反常出现的次序依样画出曲线来就行了；如果有一个自然的因素起作用的话，那么，这两条曲线应该是平行的。但看一看第一图（附件八）就足以明了这两条曲线并不是这样，反常出现的次序全是很偶然的，因而看出有一个人为因素的影响。
    委员会开始工作以前，在欧洲各国有一种假定，就是说，汽油弹的轰炸曾狂妄进行着，也许因而强烈地将部分土地灼热了。这种影响可能会打乱了各种昆虫的正常生活循环，因此引起它们在比正常季节早数周或甚至早数月出现。所以委员会很注意下面事实，即：在中国东北的许多地方发现了成批昆虫群，包括三十三次主要事件（其中几件列在附表里，附件七），但，无疑地东北这一个地区从来未被汽油弹轰炸过。
    以上的全部意见适用于在SIA组及其同类文件中所讲的各种昆虫。里面有几种用普通名称叙述的，例如“蚂蚁”和“马蝇”等等，中国的昆虫学家们都未能加以证实。这可能是由于不是科学家的普通证人们所用的名称，引起了混淆。后来，委员会研究了有关一种鞘翅目昆虫“甲虫”，即标本虫
    （Ptinus）（附件二十七）的新证据，我们将在别处叙述它。在这一个和其他关于带菌昆虫的案件里，附件中所搜罗的资料，足供研究传染病媒介与发生疫病的关系。中国和朝鲜采取什么措施来控制昆虫的问题（参看附件四十二），以及随地收集的正常昆虫标本是否带有病原体的问题，（附件四、五）也都与此有关。
    有关被散布昆虫的医学注释
    读者在后面各段中将遇到一些节足动物的名辞，不是专家可能不熟习。下文的目的就是要对这些名辞作一些解释，次序是与附件相符的。
    一种常被散播的昆虫是黑蝇（Anthomyiid Fly,,Hylemyia sp.），这一属的蝇子特别在北美洲是常见的。这一类蝇子总共有五百多种，其中有些生活在人的住所中。因为它们在人类粪便中繁殖，因而他们就自然地成为传播肠疾的重要媒介。有许多种在土里以蛹的形式过冬，一般说来他们是不会在五月以前大量出现的。在自然条件下，这种蝇子能被各种危害植物的病原菌所感染（参阅下面第二百零四页及附件十甲）。
    粪蝇（Helomyza Sp.-Family Helomyzidae）是经常麇集在粪堆上的昆虫，这类蝇包括数十种，其中大多数是依据人的、蝙蝠的、小哺乳动物及飞禽的排泄物生存。不仅在幼虫阶段，成虫也是如此。有些生活在人的住所内，它们污染食品并且成为由病原菌所引起的人类疾病的机械媒介物。
    家蝇（Musca domestica）和它的南方种Muscavicina生活在人的周围，公认为是人类疾病的媒介。它所能携带的病原体已知有六十多种。
    大家蝇（Muscina stabulans）也被认为是生活在人的周围的昆虫，人的疾病的媒介。
    以上俱属于Diptera。而襀翅目（Plecoptera）在报告中以一种Nemoura属为代表，即石蝇的一种。这些昆虫在流水的溪涧和小河中繁殖。幼虫以水生微小生物为食。成虫不喜欢远离开它们生长的地方，它们可以通过水和植物与人发生接触。
    尾跳虫目Collembola是无翅的下等昆虫，以Isotoma属来代表。它们生长在腐烂的植物、富于有机质土壤的湿地和蔬菜的根里。有些种类在水面上生长。
    人蚤Pulex irritans已证明在自然条件下可能引起鼠疫的严重的突发（Blanc et Baltlhazar）。在下文可见到这个媒介恰已被利用于细菌战中。
    标本虫Ptinus fur所属的类属，包括三十五到四十种，其大部分的生活方式是相似的。其中有些生活在人的周围。在这里所被利用的类属，在人的住所、仓库、牲畜圈、粮仓、磨房、图书馆及生产场所最常见到。它们吃去皮的谷粒、谷类、棉花子、干面包、面粉、干草、皮毛、皮革、地毡。它们在其食品上产卵。它们的蜕变过程需时三到四个月，因而一年之内至少可以生三代。成虫寿命可达五年。此虫在欧洲、亚洲及北美洲都可见到，分布很广。曾从这种虫分离出毒性强烈的炭疽杆菌（附件二十七、二十八）。
    蜘蛛在这里是以狼蛛科的二齿狼蛛属及三齿狼蛛属为代表。它们都是食肉类，无论是蚊蝇、蚁及其他种昆虫都吃。而这些昆虫又可能是人类疾病的媒介。当三齿狼蛛袭击人时，一般我们所见到的疾病现象不但是由于带毒刺伤而起，而也是由于与刺伤同时所发生的感染而来的。病原菌亦能随三齿狼蛛的排泄物而散播。这些蜘蛛的寿命可达数年之久，成年二齿狼蛛可在无食物的情况下生存二年，在无水的情况下生存数月。三齿狼蛛能忍受轻度的冰冻。
    在科学文献中可以看到关于昆虫及蜘蛛类人工培养的叙述。这方面的材料中最完整的说明，可在美国昆虫学家的集体著作“无脊髓动物的培养”里找到（纽约一九三七年出版）。
    因此，根据上面的意见，大家可以看出，某些散布下来的昆虫是公认的疾病媒介，但是亦有未经教科书列为疾病媒介的。在这些种类中，有的如像黑蝇Hylemyia sp.和粪蝇Helomyza sp.经常亦进入人类的居室，此外一些如黑跳虫Isotoma sp.等，则与人类接触很少。因此初步看来，这些节足动物似乎对于传播人类疾病，并不起什么重要作用。但是我们不能不顾到媒介物的“特定性”不仅有很大的伸缩性，而且媒介物与寄生者之间的种种关系，还存留某些没有弄清楚的地方。例如人与鸡虱Dermanyssus gallinae的关系，仅能在严格特定的条件下发生。直到一九四四年，大家还不知道这种体外寄生物传播和保存脑炎病毒的重要作用。在此时期以前，大家对于蓄意用鸡虱来引起流行脑炎势将认做是荒诞不经的。
    至于与人有密切接触的虫类，就一定比野生种类更适宜于做有效的媒介的看法，这可不能一概而论作为定律。在许多例子中间，我们可以举出Aedesscapularis类和Haemagogus spegazzinii类的蚊子为例，在实验室条件下，这两种蚊类能传播黄热病。第一种蚊子是极爱生活在人类居室中的，它们通常生活在森林附近的房屋内。可是第二种绝对不入人居室。与人共处的种类对于传播黄热病，并没有什么了不起的作用，倒是野生种类是大家公认的黄热病媒介物。
    我们举黑跳虫Isotoma为例，可以对这问题做出许多假定，但不可忘记这仅是一种推想，因为我们完全不知有无关于它们的试验：
    （一）黑跳虫→感染下等哺乳动物→外部寄生物（蚤类，疥癣虫等）→感染人类。
    （二）黑跳虫→污染食物或水→感染人类。
    （三）黑跳虫体内病原体繁殖→黑跳虫先天病→感染下等哺乳动物→感染体外寄生物→感染人类。
    （四）黑跳虫→感染植物。
    另有几种假设也是说得通的。
    类似的假设也可以应用于石蝇，Nemoura属，但这里也许有旁的可能性，目前还难于想像。
    至于半家生的苍蝇等，不难认识它们的媒介作用，尤其在实验室的人工条件下，感染的百分率可以增加，同时还能激发病原体的毒力。
    这里必须指出重要的一点：同一种类的可以在某一地区是半野生，而在另一地区则生活在人家里。举例来说，一种Kerteszia属的疟蚊在南美南纬二十四度北，没有生活在人家的习惯，亦没有传播疟疾的作用。可是在南纬二十四度以南，它们变为家生昆虫，并对疟疾的传播发生重要作用。
    最后，我们必须经过相当长久的研究，才能确定节足动物作为寄生虫病和细菌疾病媒介的作用。如疟蚊之于疟疾，跳蚤之于鼠疫，虱子和壁虱之于立克次体等。
    关于节足动物传播疾病的作用，乃是必须继续研究的问题。利用罕见的媒介物，其用意正是希望别人对于不常见种类，还不曾有控制方法。
    谈到细菌战争的方法，可以看出，用人工方法建立新的生物学的相互关系是可能的。虽然要解决这个问题还需要艰苦的研究，但还是有成功的机会。
    植物病理学的资料
    以前的文件中曾数度提起了美国飞机投下植物体的事件。根据目击者报告，这些植物体的包裹常在一○○○呎上空破裂，并散下叶子或植物的其他部分，撒布在很广泛的地面上。这样的事件于三月二十日发生在朝鲜的定州（文件NCNA/85的第九页；文件SIA/13的第四页），并发生在中国东北和朝鲜北部的十多个地方，其中有一例，这类物体落下时，曾为一个英国的战地新闻记者亲自见到了（文件SIA/6第二页）。委员会的委员们曾与国际知名的中国植物病理学家和植物学家，讨论过有关这些植物及真菌的鉴定题（附件十甲）。
    已经肯定地证明了的，是大豆秆和豆荚感染紫斑病菌（Cercospora Sojina Hara即CercosporinaKikuchii,Matsumoto ＆ Tomoyasu）的事。这种真菌是一种植物寄生物，在朝鲜和中国有过报告，它能使大豆作物受到严重的侵害和损失。正如这里所讨论过的其他案件一样，这种病原体侵入植物的组织里面，表明它不仅是表面而且内部也都受到侵染。
    在投掷的碎叶片中，有的是感染了植物炭疽病
    （Glomerella sp.其无性时代为Colletotrichum）。这种病菌的寄主范围很广，在接种实验中证明它侵害苹果、梨和棉花。普通棉炭疽病（Glomerella gossypii
    （South）Edg.）只侵害棉花及其同类的植物。而苹果的苦腐病菌（Glomerella cingulata（Stone-man）S.＆S. ）虽然可侵害三十种以上的植物，但并不侵害棉花。这二种真菌在中国都有报告。然而现在所找得的真菌在形态上是与这二种病菌不同，并且有较广的寄主范围。
    第三个散布植物病害的例证是发生在最近的七月中辽东省南边的岫岩县附近，那时委员会已开始了它的工作，所发现的桃树叶子（并非这种真菌的自然寄主）染有一种叫Macrophoma kuwatsukaiHara的病菌，这种病菌能使苹果及梨腐烂（轮纹病斑）以及在枝干上发生溃疡和凋萎。经实验证明其侵染力是极强的。
    在上述三个例证中，都有当时看到成包植物体落下的人证。
    还有一件委员会所注意的关于使用植物病害战的事实，是在美机经常侵入安东地区附近的孙家堡子村，在许多次空袭中的一次，发现有散布的玉米粒。这些玉米粒中间，有一部分经证明是侵染了一种黑粉病菌（Thecaphora）。这种真菌和欧洲、美洲所发现豆科植物黑粉病菌（Thecaphora deformans）相近似。这种真菌在中国从来没有报告过。
    虽然投掷的叶片有时是破碎的，但是其中只有一例（植物炭疽案件）叶片不能鉴定其学名。如第一例的材料经鉴定是大豆（Glycine max），第三例是桃叶（Prunus Persica），第四例是玉米（Ze-amays）。在其他事件里投掷的树叶大多是橡树
    （Quercus spp.）和高粱（Sorghum vulgare）。其中两件具有特殊意义（附件十）。一件是投掷在北朝鲜大德山地方的一些叶子，并已经鉴定为落叶橡树
    （Quereus aliena Bl, var. rubripes, Nakai）的叶子；这种树的分布仅限于朝鲜北纬三十八度以南的地区。另一事件是五月三日在中国东北海龙县投掷的另一些叶子，已经鉴定为（Lindera glauca Bl.）的叶子；这一种树只生长在南朝鲜，不分布在中国东北的。
    要附带提到的是和传播人类疾病一样，昆虫可能用来作为传播植物病害的媒介物的问题。例如，黑蝇（Hylemyia spp.）（参看前第二百零一页及附件十）是携带梨及苹果树的火疫病（Erwinia amy-rovora）、玉米的萎凋病（Phytomonas stewartii）、及蔬菜的软腐病（Erwinia carotovora）三种细菌性病害和另一种真菌病害即白菜黑脚病（Phomalingam）的媒介。此外大家蝇（Muscina stabulans）
    （参看前第二百零一页及附件十）也能携带梨及苹果树的火疫病。这些都是人所熟知的。中国植物病理学家曾自撒布的昆虫（及叶子）中分离出多种细菌。这些细菌正在研究中。
    总之，我们可以肯定地说，撒布植物病害已经成为在朝鲜和中国东北进行的生物战的一部分。
    朝鲜的事件（鼠疫）
    我们已经知道，日本在第二次世界大战中所采取用鼠疫杆菌进行细菌战的古典式的方法，系用容器或用喷撒的方法，投掷大量带有鼠疫杆菌的跳蚤。自从一九五二年初以来，在朝鲜北部的许多互不衔接的地点，发生了鼠疫，总是和成群的跳蚤的突然出现，以及美国飞机事先飞过相关联的。在文件SIA/1里报告过的七次事件中最早的一次是在二月十一日。其中有六次发现跳蚤都带有鼠疫杆菌。文件SIA/4又说，美机在二月十八日，于安州邻近投撒跳蚤，这些跳蚤已经细菌学检验证明有鼠疫杆菌，二十五日在发南里地区发生了鼠疫流行病；那个村子的六百人口当中，有五十个染病，三十六人死亡（附件七）。
    根据委员会所能得到的最好资料，在过去五个世纪里，朝鲜不曾有过鼠疫。距离最近的发生过流行病的中心，是在四百五十公里以外的中国的东北，或是在南方一千五百公里以外的福建。再则，在这个气候之中二月要比鼠疫正常的发生季节至少早三个月。最重要的是发现的跳蚤不是在自然状态中能带鼠疫杆菌的鼠蚤，而是人蚤（Pulex irritans）。我们从中国方面的鉴定（附件十二）和从其他材料
    （附件十九）里，知道日本在第二次世界大战中所用过的，也就是这种人蚤。
    委员会在朝鲜时，被邀请研究两个专案（附件十八及二十）。第一、在三月末，江西郡的一个农民，在一架美国飞机于夜间在他的村子上空盘旋后的次日早晨，发现露天的一公尺高的水缸里的水面上浮有许多跳蚤。他大概被同次投放的其他跳蚤咬过，因为他在几天之后死于腺鼠疫，其诊断已经由朝鲜及中国的科学家用病理学和细菌学的检验充分证实了。这些跳蚤也已经证明带有鼠疫杆菌。委员会的委员们曾检查了由上述专家自该病人体内分离出来的细菌培养，深信这确实是鼠疫杆菌。他们并检查了病理标本及组织切片。该地的及时的卫生措施，阻止了再发生其他病例。
    第二个研究的专案，是在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军两个中尉在淮阳附近一个荒山山坡上，发现了一群很密集的跳蚤。其分布的地带，指示出他们是从一个慢慢向北东北方向落下的容器投放出来的，但未找到任何容器的痕迹。跳蚤是这样地密集，地面和他们的裤子都变黑了，他们对此颇为惊异——委员会后来亲自询问过这两个青年。他们回到营房，带了援助的人，用石油和松枝点火消灭了这些跳蚤。在这案件中，这些军人用各种方法保护他们自己（附件二十一），并且他们迅速进行扑灭工作，在大批跳蚤能达到人行道以前，就已经被消灭了。朝鲜及中国检验队进行的细菌学的检验，证实这些跳蚤带有鼠疫杆菌，这些跳蚤是人蚤。
    必须着重指出：这些跳蚤，是寄生在人身上的。根据这个昆虫的生态学而言，在房屋外面它们不可能大量出现。那么在距离人类居所相当远的荒地上，一次就发现了成万数目的人蚤，将如何解释呢？这决不是自然条件集合来的。在邻近驻扎的中国人民志愿军，在当天清早四点钟曾听到飞机在当地上空盘旋过，这飞机与人蚤的发现是更有关联的。
    分析由人蚤传染的鼠疫的流行病学的整个过程，发见缺少了几个正常的环节。正常的情形，是鼠疫先在鼠群中流行，然后再发生于人类；人蚤由病人身上得到传染后，然后才能传给其他的人。
    由于这些事实以及其他类似的事实，委员会没有别的选择，只能下这一结论，即：美国空军在朝鲜应用了和日本在第二次世界大战中用以撒布鼠疫很相似的方法，如果不是完全一样的话。
    在平壤讨论这些专案时，委员会曾获得一位优秀的中国鼠疫专家的协助，他就是一九四一年报告的作者（附件十一）。他提出证据，说他曾经敦促国民党政府向全世界公布日本进行细菌战的罪行，但是没有成功，他认为这是部分地由于美国阻拦的结果（附件十二）。他又提起大家注意现在用在朝鲜的鼠疫杆菌菌株具有强烈毒性。
    投放带有鼠疫杆菌的跳蚤，当然不是希图引起鼠疫流行的唯一方法，其他的方法也可以应用，现在我们将看到其他方法是确实已经被使用了。
    甘南事件
    请委员会仔细研究的另一件案例，是关于突然发现一批感染而患有鼠疫病的小田鼠的事件。这一事件的前后情况衔接得比较完全些。一九五二年四月五日早晨，甘南县治四个村子的村民，醒来发现他们周围有大量似鼠的动物（附件十三）。甘南县位于中国东北黑龙江省的西部，与内蒙古相毗邻。
    前一夜，有许多村民曾听到一架飞机在上空飞过，中国防空瞭望队所供给的情报，说该机在晚上将近十点的时候越过鸭绿江，约于十一时三十分飞到甘南地区上空，随后又循原线飞回，似已完成其任务（附件十三）。中国防空瞭望队认明它是F/82双机身夜间战斗机。翌晨，村民在他们房屋和庭院里、在屋顶上、甚至在他们的炕上，发现许多将死或已死的小田鼠，有许多则撒布于村屯周围。在面积约5×15公里的居民地区内及其附近，共捕灭717只（附件十三）。
    这在季节上是反常的，因为在这个地区，这种小啮齿动物，通常要在一个月以后才开始出现，而且也不会有这么大的数目。出现的地点也是反常的，因为小田鼠不是常到人类居住区来的动物。
    所发现的鼠类，在地区性上也似乎是异常的，因为当地居民未曾看见过。它可以鉴定为小田鼠
    （Microtus）属，其形态与Microtus（Stenocranius）gregalis, gregalis种相似。以前德田氏（1941）曾由中国东北位于甘南西北的一些地区报告过有这一种鼠类，其他学者从更西的地点亦有过报告。进一步的分类研究仍由中国科学家继续进行中（附件十五、十六）。再则，这一属鼠类，是不包括在中国东北鼠疫地方病区的普通携带鼠疫杆菌的三种鼠类之中的（附件十三）。
    根据能够得到的记载，甘南地区从来没有过任何型的鼠疫，并且有很充分的理由，证明这些小田鼠很不可能是从最近的鼠疫地方病区迁移来的，因为距离很远，障碍也多（附件十四）。此外，在季节上，至少比鼠疫地方病区啮齿动物中发现鼠疫的通常时期早了一个月（附件十三）。可以用作细菌学试验的田鼠虽只保存了一只，但从这个标本得到的带有强烈毒性的鼠疫杆菌的证据，加上上述证人的证明，就毫无错误地指出这一群动物是感染鼠疫的。委员会中有资格进行实验的委员们，曾在沈阳中国医科大学的细菌学实验室里，与中国科学家们合作，亲自举行实验，做给委员会全体委员看，证实中国专家所得的证据（附件十三、十四）。
    在这一连串的证据中所缺少的主要环节，是没有发现任何种容器或“炸弹”。但是，在一九五二年一月的一份日本杂志“星期每日”中，曾介绍过一种带有降落伞的硬纸制成的容器，在投掷其装载的病鼠之后，即自动焚毁而不留痕迹（附件十七）；所以，这一缺少的环节并不足以推翻上述的许多证据。日本出版的另一个报刊（兴亚新闻一九五二年八月）曾披露日本有一个大量繁殖鼠类的机构，这个机构是由石井四郎过去的助手小川主管（附件四十一）。
    唯一要补充的，是委员会在沈阳曾听取十个农民的作证，而且一个一个地访问了他们的家庭。同时也听取了在事件发生后负责当地卫生措施的防疫专家的作证，听取了进行调查并分离出鼠疫杆菌来的细菌学专家的作证，听取了负责研究啮齿动物的动物学专家的作证。委员会认为当地居民这次之所以能避免鼠疫之危害，应归功于最初发现异常的啮齿动物后立即实施的预防措施，并归功于在当天中午就迅速将全部猫、狗消灭。在采取的预防措施中，有一非常有效的消灭居屋中跳蚤的方法，就是将屋中家具移出，在地上和炕上铺上一层干草，然后将草烧起来。这方法在中国东北普遍采用。因为这些理由，染有鼠疫杆菌的跳蚤，就不能将病原体传染于人。
    所以，委员会的意见是：毫无疑问的，这一大批患有鼠疫的小田鼠，是一九五二年四月四日至五日夜间村民所听到的飞机在甘南地区投下的。这架飞机系美国F/82型双机身夜航战斗机。
    宽甸事件
    有一个案例，是黑蝇和蜘蛛同时反常地出现；委员会对此已详细研究（附件二十二）。在一九五二年三月十二日，辽东省东南部靠近鸭绿江边的宽甸县的居民，于午后约半小时，看见八架美国F/86式战斗机飞过该县城上空。他们对美机的识别已无困难，因为美机侵入该县上空已是极普通而且几乎每天都发生的。中国防空瞭望队证实那些飞机是F/86式战斗机，并且测绘出该飞机的航程。有一人很清楚地看见其中有一架掷下一个光亮的圆筒状物体。该物体似落于东门外，该地居民，包括学生，立即组织起来，往该地区搜寻，找到许多黑蝇
    （Hylemyia sp.）和蜘蛛（Tarentula sp.）。
    这事发生九天之后，学生中有一人碰巧在该物体落下时所造成的浅坑里面及其附近，发现一个容器的许多碎片（附件二十二、二十三）。地点是一个沙洲上的苞米地，而包围该沙洲的河床在当时（冬天）是干涸的。最大的“弹”片是金属的，但最多的碎片是一种薄而带小孔的石灰质的，其性质并不是立刻弄得清楚的。后来已检定了，这将另行讨论
    （见第二百一十九页）。次日，即有两位在四天前曾往该地附近搜查过的很有资历的昆虫学专家至当地视察，他们收集了更多的蝇子，并用热水溶化积雪，很仔细地把容器的碎片尽可能收集了许多。
    在垄沟中有积雪，可以说明为什么昆虫（在低温环境中行动迟钝）落下已有周余而仍逗留在落下附近地区。也可以说明大量的禽类羽毛同时投下的也同样留在同一地方。这种昆虫和蜘蛛在这种季节出现是反常的（见上文第一百九十九页），而且，从昆虫的品种来说，也有地域上的异常（见上文第一百九十八页）。
    中国人进行了合乎标准的细菌学检验，证明了昆虫、蜘蛛和羽毛都带有致病的炭疽杆菌（Bacillusanthracis）（附件二十二）。这种细菌在节足动物的身上或体内发现，应认为是十分不平常的现象。虽然这种细菌在禽类羽毛上发现并非十分特别，但是中国科学家把从中国北部及东北随便收集的羽毛标本进行细菌检查，却没有查得该种细菌（附件六）。虽然这些羽毛也许只是用来包装昆虫以保证其安全降落，但必须记住，在别的事件中，带有炭疽的羽毛，曾被单独投掷过。美机这次投掷的结果，在该县及其附近，未引起炭疽病发生。
    从以上的事实看来，委员会没有旁的选择，只能得到这样的结论，即：在三月十二日，至少有一架美国飞机，用至少一个特制的容器，在中国东北地区的辽东省的这个小城附近，掷下带有炭疽杆菌的昆虫和蜘蛛。
    辽东辽西事件（呼吸道炭疽病）
    委员会曾详尽地研究了美国飞机从鸭绿江彼岸飞来并飞回彼处而被目睹投下各种物体（附件二十七）的许多案例。当地目击者立刻去搜索投下的物件，虽然在估计投下的地点没有找到容器，但却发现了其他的东西：主要地是找到了许多甲虫——标本虫（Ptinus fur）（平常是粮仓及其他干货仓的害虫），或找到了许多禽类的羽毛。在若干案例中，大量的家蝇（Musca vicina）出乎意料的出现，正如我们熟知的，这在季节上是反常的，因为当时地上尚有积雪。按季节说，甲虫的出现并非反常，但大量的在露天和白日出现，从生态学眼光看来，是非常特殊的。中国细菌学家检验标本虫、羽毛、家蝇，找出它们都是带有炭疽杆菌的。虽然物体不同，但从它们分离出来的菌株，在发酵试验中都具有相同的反应，这是一个异常的与可疑的情况。
    委员会曾详细询问了二十四个人证，其中有些人曾亲眼看见物体从飞机上落下。中国防空瞭望队对所有案例，都有记录（附件二十七），这些记录指出侵入的飞机大都是F/86型战斗机，只有一次例外，系一架B/26型轰炸机。有一次，有好几个人看见投一个像大号红色暖水瓶样的物体，在约距地面三十呎时“扑”的一声，在空中爆炸，放出一种像燃烧兽皮兽角那样的难闻气味。另一次，一有价值的证词，说在估计物体下落的地点找不到任何容器，但说在该地点落下了大量的羽毛，这些羽毛由该地点被风缓缓吹散，形成一个三角形，缓缓地向前伸展和扩张。在这场合，关于容器的描述，使人立即联想起在宽甸的自动毁灭的蛋壳形的弹（附件二十二及第二百一十九页）。
    辽东和辽西两省的许多地区有关飞机、容器、出现生物体和细菌学检验的证据，因对呼吸道炭疽和出血性炭疽脑膜炎病人死亡材料进行具体的并仔细分析的研究，而更为丰富了（附件二十七）。有五个病例经过了研究：一个铁路工人，一个三轮车夫，一个主妇，一个教员，一个农民。这五个人所害的病，病程都很短促，病理学家在尸体检验和组织学检验中所得的结果也都相同。委员会相信他们之中没有人在职业上与炭疽有联系。造成两例死亡的因素显然是标本虫，而另两例死亡的因素是蝇子和羽毛。委员会十分满意中国科学家们所下的诊断和他们所指示的证据。还有，询问证人又获得了
    （附件二十八）在文件中所遗漏的材料（附件二十七），即：在这五个受害人中，有四个在参加群众捕捉昆虫和收集羽毛时，没有采用大多数人所采用的公认的防疫方法，没有用口罩保护呼吸道，没带手套，捉拿昆虫时没有用镊子。在显微镜下可以看出标本虫很适于经过这路径散布炭疽，因为在它的鞘翅上有许多脆的角质的刺易被吸入体内。这件事实在文件里被忽视了。
    不要以为由染有炭疽病物体所引起的死亡，只有这几人。这五个具有精确的病理学分析的病例，是作为例证而举出的。以前在这个地区，这种病是十分稀少的，只有清楚知道此点，对这五个病例才能全盘了解。统计的证据（附件二十七、二十八），指明在中国东北不但典型的皮肤的或脓胞性的炭疽病在近年非常稀少，而且呼吸系统炭疽病诱致出血性脑膜炎是完全没有过的。
    文献中曾有主张用炭疽杆菌于细菌战的，这是人所熟知。虽然在自然条件下，人与人之间的传播是稀有的，因此，自然发生的流行不容易产生；但是，这种杆菌有广泛的宿主范围，高度的感染性（如果有毒），对环境条件的高度抗力等等“有利”条件，所以，能使一地区长期受其毒害。而且，还要指出，当通过呼吸道发生感染时，潜藏性很强。这里所提到的受害者直到他们突然昏倒以前，全都还是比较正常的，及至昏倒后，在二十四小时或更短的时间内，便告死亡。
    经由呼吸路径的炭疽感染，与美国进行细菌战的研究工作联系起来看，是有重要意义的。在一九四六年及一九四七年发表的狄特里克细菌武器工厂的研究结果（附件二十七、三十五），说能够在人造培养基上培养出新的炭疽杆菌，它不只具有异常高度的毒性，而且能特别适于经由呼吸路径传染。
    委员会根据提出的证据和委员会代表们自己向许多证人——包括医学界人士和普通人士——所作的深入的长久的问话，不得不下这样的一个结论，即在中国两个省份的许多地方，曾有带着炭疽杆菌的各种生物体投掷下来，引起了许多人感染了当地以往尚未有过的肺炭疽病及由其诱致的出血性脑膜炎，因而致死。不能怀疑的目睹者的证辞说，投掷这些带有病菌的物体的是美国飞机。
    大同事件（霍乱）
    朝鲜保健相请委员会详细研究的事件之一，是由于霍乱而引起死亡的案件。这些案件可以作为自一九五二年二月以来在乡村地区所发生的这类事件的例证（附件二十九）。五月十六日，有人听见美国飞机一架，盘旋一小时以上，好像它的驾驶员是在寻找什么东西；第二天清晨，一个农村妇女在山坡上拾草的时候，发现一些稻草包，里面包着一种蛤蜊。她拾了一些蛤蜊回到家里，和她的丈夫生吃了一顿；当天晚上两人突然发病，第二天晚上两人都死亡。医学的证据，指出死因是霍乱（附件二十九）。民兵在山坡上找到许多包蛤蜊，由朝鲜和中国专家们进行细菌学检验，证明所有的蛤蜊都严重地感染了霍乱弧菌（附件二十九）。
    越仔细检查，越看出全部事实发生经过是不平常。首先，这样带有细菌的海洋软体动物出现在乡村中间的山上，只能认为是极不自然的现象。而且，从流行病学来看，病人的死亡，也是极不正常。所提出来的证据，使委员会深信：在朝鲜，霍乱从来就不是地方流行病；因为在过去四十年中，虽然曾经发生过几次，但都能够追溯到一个入境的港口。可是这次出事现场，却是一个纯粹乡村的地点。而且，在这一世纪里，霍乱于五月间在朝鲜发生的事，只有过一例；很少有在八月以前出现的。再则，发现的蛤蜊也有几个特点。在朝鲜，出卖的蛤蜊，通常不是用稻草包的，它的出现的季节，也比平常早一个月（事实上，自从战争发生以来，它们就从未上过市）；假如有人不嫌麻烦，把这些小包放在山坡上各处，那么就难于解释为什么有许多蛤蜊的石灰质的厚壳竟会摔破了。
    当察看蛤蜊出现地点的性质时，事情的前前后后就明白了。找到蛤蜊的地方，距离山顶上的抽水站约四百公尺，距离一系列的蓄水池或泉水池约一千公尺。这里的水，由抽水站分送到沿海的几个屯和港口城市，一部分是供给饮用的。在发现蛤蜊的前一天，在抽水站旁边的滤水厂，被美国飞机用小型的炸弹准确地炸毁了，而抽水机本身却没有毁坏。委员会亲自询问当地的居民，他们的证辞（附件三十），说明在第二次空袭时，即蛤蜊出现的那一夜，是黑暗而且有风的。所有这些事实，明显地显示出这是经过缜密计划存心企图污染饮用的蓄水池中的水。这个计划的主要目的并没有达到，是因为投掷蛤蜊那天夜里的气候条件，使驾驶员不能找到这些蓄水池。在那天夜里，这些蓄水池的水面不能像镜子那样的光亮。
    虽然如此，可能还有人觉得奇怪，怎么一种海洋的或者至少是海口的双壳类软体动物，会被认为适宜于投入淡水来使水源染上细菌。可是，极堪注意的证明（附件三十、三十一）不但提醒了委员会，霍乱弧菌是一种嗜盐的有机体，并且告诉委员会，日本有一些研究文献说海洋的双壳类软体动物是很适于这种细菌生长的培养基，这就使得要知道这一类的细菌战争的计划如何进行的最后的一个环节也清楚了。蛤蜊在不等渗的淡水中缓慢地死亡，在此期间，这种软体动物可以成为霍乱弧菌的天然培养器。已死之后，所放出的霍乱弧菌，在淡水中可以生存三十天（附件三十一）。
    因此委员会只能得出这样的一个结论，即：美国空军根据事先定好的一个缜密的计划，首先破坏大同的滤水厂而不损毁抽水机，然后企图用霍乱弧菌污染饮用的蓄水池。这一对年青的夫妇，由于战争的蹂躏而致穷困，因而不慎吃了这些意图用为散菌媒介的蛤蜊，以致死亡。
    这一案件，应该在本报告书其他地方所讲到的以蝇类作为人为的霍乱细菌携带者的证据（在另处叙述，见附件四、五、六）联系起来研究。
    容器或“炸弹”的种类
    现在已到了该注意容器或“炸弹”——假使这个名称是适用于带有少量爆炸物或不带爆炸物的军器——的时候了。在不同的时间和地点，特别在沈阳与平壤附近，委员会有机会从容研究各种从空中带下生物物体的各种不同的容器。委员会的委员们因此能证实布拉格文件中的许多陈述，并且详实研究比布拉格所已讲到的更新的更精细的方法。但委员会的工作并未因而比较容易，因为这些新的方法，包括着“自己消毁的容器”，这就是说，这些容器或者是能够自己爆裂成小块，细小得不会被发现，或者是这些容器在把东西投下之后自己燃烧而消失；关于此点，不久就看得更清楚。此外，在布拉格文件中，甚至在委员会所收集的证辞中，也免不了有一些搞不清楚之处，因为甚至在场亲见容器投下的证人，也不一定就找到容器，部分的原因是他们很自然地并不十分知道他们找什么，部分的原因是即使找到，他们的叙述也不那么详细。被俘的美国空军军官的供词，可惜也没有将这种地方搞清楚。他们的职位是驾驶员和领航员，对于这些炸弹和容器，不能得到准确和详细的知识。必须记住，在驾驶员听讲的一次讲演中（Quinn / Ashfork；看底下第二百二十六页与附件三十八）很明白地说，“我们的炸弹还在实验时期，并且有好几种。”所以，这一段话的内容，必须在适当的保留之下加以接受。
    容器有不同的形式，不同的使用方法，这大概是为着适合于不同目的。此外，传布病疫的昆虫等物也可直接投散于目标地域。为了方便起见，可先从研究完全不用容器的喷雾法开始，而以研究自己消毁的容器结束。在这两者中间，则有带降落伞的或不带降落伞的不太特殊的容器。
    （一）喷雾法：
    在NCNA/85.第四页（美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团朝鲜分团调查报告书）说有中国人民志愿军一人，在二月十一日，于铁原看见美机在三百公尺的空中喷射昆虫。因为美机飞过之后在雪地上发现大量的昆虫分布于十公里长五公里宽的长方形地区，由这一事实只能作此判断。四个美空军俘虏，在五个分开的演讲中都听说能用而且会用喷雾法来进行细菌战。其中有一个俘虏在其声明中画有装在飞机内的喷雾器的图样（O’Neal,ISCK/4，附件三十九）；另一个俘虏的声明中（Kniss ISCK/5，附件四十）则说他听说喷雾法将在六月开始使用。但奥尼尔相信喷雾法至少在二月十八日就开始应用了。所以，这位中国志愿军的判断可能是对的。
    至于喷雾法所散布的昆虫的种类，似乎可以肯定地说，脆小的昆虫如蚊子等是不适宜于用这种方法投掷的，但是在其他的讨论中（附件十二）指出，跳蚤是可以用这种方法喷撒的。当然这个方法可以用来喷撒细菌、病毒和毒素。
    （二）不爆炸的物体及纸包：
    几件布拉格文件中曾提到各种颜色的纸包被发现，从这些纸包爬出昆虫。二月十一日，中国人民志愿军在铁原看见三架美机投下这种不爆炸的物体，寻找后发现是圆柱形黄色纸包，二十米厘高十米厘直径（SIA/1，P.6； SIA/4，P.5）。在附近别处找到了长方形灰色的纸包，10×10×3糎，其中也有昆虫。三月四日有美机在平壤投下白色纸包（NCNA/85P.8）。三月十日在昌道投下棕色纸包（NCNA/85P.6）。被俘的美国空军战俘听的两次演讲中（Enoch/Wilson及Quinn/Ashfork见下第二百二十五页），也曾讲到用纸包装着带菌的昆虫。由此可见，硬体的昆虫，是可以用纸包包后在低空投下，大概有些空纸包是从金属传单容器或
    “炸弹”爆炸后或者在空中开放后所掉出来的。我们现在就来谈这些传单炸弹。
    （三）空中爆炸的各种定时信管的传单炸弹：
    这种容器，是发表过的朝鲜和中国有关细菌战的文件中讲得最多的一种，朝中两国当局所收集的容器中最普遍的一种。委员会的委员们看到许多这种容器。这种炸弹的大小和形状大约与平常美国的五百磅HE炸弹相同，但其体重大概只有一百五十磅左右，因此能够用手托着装上飞机（附件四十一）。它带有一个圆柱形的顶端，顶端中有定时信管。顶端为一小空格，其下则为圆柱形的炸弹体，被三块钢板隔成四格。整个炸弹可以从纵的方向平分为二而裂开，这样，在装在铰链上的一半弹壳，能够在任何预定的时候摆开，把装在弹内的东西投下来。在最低的一格的下面，弹形又狭窄起来，成一圆锥形的空格，其外边装着四个弹翼，而在弹的底部有一孔，如炸弹装置降落伞，则降落伞可以从此孔跑出来。在已发表讲到这种炸弹的几个文件中
    （NCNA/85，SIA/13，ISCC/4 etc. ），炸弹的大小，讲得有些不同，但委员会所看见的，以及美国空军俘虏所叙述的，这炸弹大概有一．四公尺长，直径四○厘米，弹壳是三毫米之钢片制成，内分四格，容量为七二公升。定时信管约七．六厘米长。弹壳外面写着“传单炸弹——五百磅—M105LOT—U.S.Time（Fuse）—Empty”，依照空军俘虏的叙述（附件三十七、四十）。弹门大约在离地三十公尺高就张开，将装在弹内的东西散布在一○○公尺直径的地区内。
    一个最典型的目睹者的报告（NCNA/85,SIA/13），是在三月二十六日，有一个军医，在宁远看见一架美机在上空盘旋，然后俯冲下来，投弹二枚。这二枚炸弹着地时，都炸开成两半，造成昆虫密集地带约二○○公尺长一○○公尺宽，最高密度约每平方公尺一百多只昆虫，以弹坑（约五寸深）内为最密（NCNA/85P.5）。本委员会有机会亲自询问许多证人，其中大多数是农民。这些人证在辽东省长白县找到了三个这种传单炸弹，是在三月二十七日及三十一日由飞机空投下来的，周围有昆虫密集。在平壤时，委员会又检查了收集到的这种容器，现将其列成详细表格如下（附件二十六）：
    （附图表）
    只有一点要增加的，即：向委员会作证的四个美国空军俘虏所听的九次演讲中，每次都或详或略地讲到这种容器，并且这四个被俘美国空军人员都认为装在他们的飞机上并由他们投掷下的细菌弹就是这一种（附件三十七、四十）。
    如众所周知，国际新闻界对于使用传单弹为细菌容器曾发生公开争论，但是美军化学兵团的负责人曾经宣布这种炸弹足可用来进行投掷生物的物体（SIA/9P.I；NCNA/85，P.5； ISCC/4）。
    （四）装有螺旋桨的空中爆炸的传单弹。
    这种容器是上面所说的那种炸弹改成的。炸弹顶端所装有的信管，安置有一个小的可转动的气钮或螺旋桨，它们转动到一定次数就会使信管爆炸。在本委员会开始工作之前，所有已发表的各种文件中，都没有提到这种容器，也并未发现使用这种容器的任何证据。可是在美国空军俘虏叙述他在听一次演讲时，曾经讲到这种容器（O’Neal/McLaugh-lin 见下面第二百二十六页）。
    （五）由螺旋桨打开弹门的传单弹。
    这种容器的外形与上面所说的两种容器相似。炸弹顶端装有可转动的螺旋桨或气钮，转动了一定次数后，就开动了一个机关，把一连串的弹门打开。于是弹内的袋就被风吹出来。可是在布拉格文件中也没有提及这种容器。本委员会也没有找到有这种炸弹或使用这种炸弹的直接证据。不过在美国空军俘虏所听到的一次演讲中却讲到这种容器
    （Quinn/Ashfork见下面第二百二十六页）。
    （六）落地之后弹门开启或炸弹分开两半的传单弹。
    炸弹落地时的震动，使弹内的电池产生电流，开动一个机关，将这种容器的一半或一连串的弹门打开。塑胶制成的隔板碰破之后，酸液就流到金属片上，使生电流。这在布拉格文件中没有提及，本委员会也没找到有这种容器的直接证据。但美国空军俘虏所听的一次讲课中却讲到这种容器
    （Quinn/Ashfork见下面第二百二十六页）。该俘虏后来能够在他的供词上画出它的图样（附件三十八）。根据他的描写，知道这种炸弹一定装有降落伞，可能这就是在演讲课所讲到的用降落伞投掷带菌昆虫的那种容器。（O’Neal/McLaughlin; Kniss/Holleman; Kniss/McLaughlin）这些俘虏中，有一人（附件三十九）还能画出他所想到的这种带有降落伞的容器的图样。
    （七）带有丝制降落伞的纸筒或硬纸筒。
    本委员会见到的带有降落伞的容器，只有这一种，它与照明弹相似。它是一个硬纸筒，厚一米厘，长三六米厘，直径为一三米厘。盒外有（USCS/1—1—1952—LOT 100-F-6）。系于纸筒上的丝制降落伞的直径只有七○米厘。已经指出这降落伞的大小只有普通照明弹的降落伞的三十分之一（NCNA/850.5），因此，可推知它飘流于空中是不会长久的。而且指出在纸筒上并没有一点燃烧的痕迹。有一些这样纸筒经本委员会检查，果然如此。还有一点也很重要，即：有一次，当找到一个这样的容器时，看来它是散布摇蚊的（江东郡，三月二十六日，NCNA/85；SIA/13）。用这种方法来散布脆弱的昆虫如摇蚊（ORTHOCLADIUS）或蚊虫，无疑地是很方便的。
    （八）带纸制降落伞的纸容器（自己消毁）。
    关于这种容器，本委员会并没有见到，美国空军俘虏也没有讲到。但是，在一九五二年一月的日本“星期每日”周刊中（附件十七）榊亮平少校所写的一篇文章中，曾详细讲过这种容器。根据这篇文章所说，这种容器是用硬纸做的，分成几隔，有重使其下降，且带有信管，这信管能使容器和纸制（或丝制）降落伞在适宜时候燃烧起来。照榊亮平所讲，当容器着地启开后，轻轻地把生物（带鼠疫菌的老鼠）放出来，经过足够时间，容器和降落伞即着火自焚，不留一点痕迹。这种容器很易改装，使它在离地二十到三十公尺时就把容器内的东西撒出，这样，容器本身就轻一点，被风吹离该地，然后着火烧得无踪无迹。榊亮平特别讲到使用这种容器来装带有鼠疫杆菌的老鼠，这就使人推测在甘南事件中有大批这种容器被使用（看第二百零八页），但迄今仍无明确的证据。此外，若用纸容器装载老鼠时，在飞行时间，必须使老鼠处于半麻醉状况中，以防它们咬破纸包逃出。本委员会提及这点，只是要使人注意这种可能性。
    （九）陶质或瓷质炸弹形的容器。
    在第二次世界大战时，日本细菌战机构曾在哈尔滨附近的一个特种工厂中制造至少有二种大小尺寸的瓷质（实际上是陶质的）炸弹形的容器。委员会在沈阳已研究这二种容器（大的约八○米厘长，小的约五○米厘长）。在日本仍然主张用这种容器来携带细菌培养基，如上面榊亮平论文中所说的（附件十七）；但是本委员会没有找到在一九五二年在朝鲜和中国使用这种容器的证据。根据这个炸弹而改进的最精巧的容器，就是“蛋壳式”的容器，在落地后破碎成许多小块，很易被人忽视。
    （十）人造“蛋壳”式的容器。
    三月二十一日，在辽东省宽甸县的城外，发现了二百多片石灰质容器的碎片，一块帽形的钢片，在它的凹面的中央有一金属轴。现场情况（报告ISCC/3，附件二十二）指出，这些东西一定是美国飞机在十二日投下的容器的残骸，并有理由使人认为带有炭疽杆菌的家蝇、蜘蛛及羽毛都是装在这种容器里被投掷下来的。这些金属的及石灰质的碎片已由中国科学院近代物理研究所及应用物理研究所详尽研究，把其原来容器的形状测绘出来。
    这样，可能推断这个容器大约是圆柱状，至少有一端是圆顶形。容器全长约四○米厘，金属轴长二八米厘（附件二十二）。钢帽的半径为一二．五米厘；其直径一七．四米厘；石灰质弹身之半径为一四米厘。石灰质的弹壁厚约二米毫，弹身外面涂抹    一层铝漆，由X光检查，弹壁主要系炭酸钙制成。用分光镜检查，弹片主要是炭酸钙，尚有一点镁。用某种方法造成很脆的炭酸钙质的匣子，用化学测验找出其含有有机物，用这种有机物来粘结炭酸钙质颗粒。还有我们不够明了的，是怎样这么一个脆弱的容器能受得了离开飞机时那种振荡。
    宽甸事件（（ISCC/3，）在SIA/3文件第二页及SIA/8文件第六页已有部分讲到。本委员会能检验保存下来的碳质碎片，但本委员会所注意的，这不是唯一的事件。迟至六月六日，在朝鲜碧潼附近，发现了空投昆虫，同时有人看到由空中缓缓降下银色球体，大约有足球大小的二倍（附件二十四）。不会有多大疑问，这又是同一类型的容器。此外，北井子事件（（ISCC/5 SIA/6，第一页）的证人，有一人作证说他亲眼看到美机投下一发亮的物体。也投下带有炭疽杆菌的大量羽毛。别的证词，也提到这种容器（SIA/10，第一页附件七），但不可能确定。总之，本委员会认为在三月及六月中，此种容器曾在鸭绿江的两岸被使用过，是一无可怀疑的事实。
    （十一）各式各样的容器。
    除上述各种容器外，提出的证据证实了他种容器也被使用。曾有文件讲到用铁丝笼（NCNA/85第五页）及木箱（同上第六页）装载鼠类。如果这类东西确由空中投下，大约是由带有降落伞的炸弹和其他东西一同投下的。在大同地区，空投带霍乱菌的蛤蜊是用稻草包装的（附件二十九）。又有文件（NCNA/8，第六页SIA/13）讲到有手榴弹形的容器，但委员会未曾看到。本委员会的委员们在平壤曾有机会检验了绿色透明的昆虫容器的碎片，它是作为炮弹发射的（NCNA/35第五、六页SIA/13）。美国空军俘虏所听的演讲，至少有二次讲到炮兵参加细菌战（Enoch/wilson及O’Neal/Williams,见下第二百二十六页）；但本委员会始终未找到证据来证明榊亮平所述的细菌战的方法，即以含有魏尔趣杆菌（气坏疽）或破伤风杆菌的粘液涂在炮弹上面，已实际使用过（附件十七）。用作做冬衣用的棉花，曾有一次在中国人民志愿军的战壕附近发现，检验出带有乙型副伤寒杆菌（与DGMS，CPVF的通信）。
    （十二）空投下来的生物在地面上分布的情况。
    凡阅读本报告的附件及布拉格文件的，可以看到许多人证时时讲到昆虫密集地区是圆形的，而以传单弹的碎片为中心。这可说是在空中爆炸或容器开放的地点，以此为中心，越近中心就越密集，分布得很有规律。
    除上述这些案例之外，本委员会尚注意到颇有兴趣的二件投下的物体在地面分布情形的案例。在一案例中（ISSC/5，附件二十七、二十八），羽毛在落地以后，徐徐为风吹开，形成一个三角形的地带，长约3/4公里，宽不到1/3公里（最宽处）。这地带是逐渐延长，逐渐扩大。虽然没有找到容器或碎片，炸弹大概是蛋壳形的。在另一案例中（ISCK/3，附件二十、二十一），在一个无树木的小山的山坡发现大量的人蚤，分布的地区为椭圆形，大约30×10公尺，最高密度是在椭圆形二个中心之一。从这种情形，可推断人蚤是由某一种容器投下，可能是带有降落伞的容器，这容器是沿着椭圆形的长轴而行的。
    被俘获的特务们的供词
    朝鲜当局告诉委员会，自战事发生以来，即有特务被派入朝鲜北部，希图刺探有关细菌战的病疫流行的情况，报告回去。这些特务有许多已被俘获了，他们的招供，大大地揭露了美国的特务组织以及这个组织叫他们做的工作。有几个特务的资料已经公布过了，例如文件SIA/7是关于一个中国籍和一个朝鲜籍特务的详细资料。
    委员会的委员们在平壤有机会与这些特务中的一人作了长时间的谈话（附件三十六）。这个青年未曾读完书就在一九四五年参加了南朝鲜政府的“青年组织”，当美军最后撤退时，他随着美军撤退。他之所以反对北朝鲜，其动机是个人的小利益，而不是政治信仰。
    他因无法生活，乃参加美军辅助特务队。他讲述他于一九五一年十二月至一九五二年三月间在汉城一个名叫“K.L.O.”的组织受政治的、军事的和卫生的训练（附件三十六）。在那里，教他收集情报的技术。正在这个期间，细菌战发生了。约自二月初起，给他打了很多的免疫针，虽然没有告诉他注射的是什么。直到他被派出的前夕，他没有和外国军官接触过，但最后的指示是由一个美国少校通过翻译告诉他的。指示他在什么地区中活动，并且详细告诉他美军所要知道的是些什么病（伤寒、鼠疫、霍乱、脑炎、痢疾和天花）的情报。又告诉他北朝鲜统计资料的编制方法，叫他如有可能，就与政府的卫生机关及其他机关接触，以取得情报，如必要时也不惜进行偷窃。又告诉他要极端注意饮食，不要在撒布过昆虫的地方过夜，并且不要喝未煮沸的水。还说，朝鲜北部是到处都流行着疫病，不过他打过的注射针会给他很大的保护。
    这个证人，依照着指示，于三月二十九日越境进入北朝鲜，他跟一个无线电报收发员一同工作，直至五月二十日他被捕为止。在回答审问时，他相当缄默，也许是为了庇护其同伴。他说，他希图与北朝鲜的卫生人员接近，但没有多大成功，因之送往美军总部的情报极少，几乎是没有。
    这个证人说，在他非法进入北朝鲜以前，并没有告诉他细菌战正在进行。他只听说在北方有很多流行病，并且听说在朝鲜南方的军队“正在使用最新式的科学武器，结果良好”。他看了布告，才知道有细菌战。
    委员会全体一致认为从这个证人的举止和他关于他的任务与他所得的指示的证辞，可看出其具有真实性，他完全没有受到任何压迫，不论是肉体的或精神的压迫。此外，从他的表现，就看出他是一个唯利是图的人。委员会认为遣送调查疫情的特务越境是不难置信的事。委员会认为这个特务的任务是供给细菌战的效果的情报。这个结论只是在控诉美军罪行的已集积起来的大量证据上又增添了证据。
    美国空军俘虏的供词
    一九五二年一月十三日，美国空军的一架B—26轰炸机在朝鲜安州上空被击落。五月五日，领航员伊纳克及驾驶员奎恩作了很长的声明，供认他们参加细菌战。他们的供词，已由北京向全世界公布。这两篇文件，分别见于布拉格印行的小册子（SIA/14和15）中，并且有原稿的影印本。有关部分，已列入附录。虽然后来的几次询问并没有增加许多技术上与科学上的证据，但文件SIA/17及18仍应参考（附件三十七、三十八）。
    这两个空军人员的供词的要点是什么？第一、这两个军官都曾在日本及朝鲜听了细菌战方法的秘密讲演。他们被迫去听的这两个报告，包含着极秘密的内容，它讲到如何直接投掷或喷射细菌，使用昆虫来传播疾病（机械地传播或生物学地传播），使用带有降落伞的容器投掷下来的鼠类，使用有毒食物，和使用带菌炮弹。讲到了各种容器或“炸弹”，并画出其样子来。讲到了投掷的正确高度和航空速度。在奎恩中尉听的讲演里面，特别重要的内容有：（1）“几乎任何昆虫都可用来散布疾病”（即机械的传播）；（2）“可以投掷鼠类，虽然不一定需要”；（3）准备用大脑炎，“因为它没有可靠的治疗方法”。
    第二、这两个军官都接到进行细菌战飞行的命令，虽然他们内心极不愿意，但还是执行了飞行任务。所用的特别炸弹，有各种特征，而且往往由卫兵看守，不让驾驶员走近去检查。在一次报告中，讲解了何种飞机最适于投掷何种容器。据这两个空军人员所知，他们的同伴，有许多人也参与了进行细菌战的飞行，而且他们由后来的谈话，知道空军人员受过细菌战训练的人数很多（SIA/17）。伊纳克中尉，在接受飞行命令时携带的被称为“细菌弹”，奎恩中尉在接受飞行命令时携带的则被称为“不爆炸的炸弹”，但叫他们报告飞行结果时，都只准用“不爆炸的炸弹”的名称。
    无可怀疑地，这两篇供词对于西方国家会发生很大的影响。但那些不愿意相信的人们，想藉口说这些供词是用肉体或精神的磨难取得的，说只有两个人出来供认，说也许根本就没有那两个人，供词全部是伪造的；——想用这些藉口来抹杀这些供词。但是企图在奎恩中尉的供词中找出矛盾，却找不到（SIA/16）。
    在这种情况下，委员会能在朝鲜某地，与上述的二人及另外两个战俘奥尼尔中尉及克尼斯中尉会晤，是极重要的（附件三十九、四十）。奥尼尔与克尼斯的供词更长而且更详细。委员会看见这四个美国空军人员时，觉得他们是看到了美国生活的剖面：一个是头脑冷静的电机工程师，一个是中等阶级的商人，一个是青年的化学家，还有一个是农家出身的身体强壮的钢铁工人。委员会有机会在自由谈话的环境中与这四个人晤谈良久。委员会的委员们不约而同地认为对这几个战俘并没有施用肉体或精神上的压力，强迫他们发表声明。他们发表声明，都是出于自愿的。俘获他们的中国人和朝鲜人长期的友善的待遇，使他们认识他们对全人类的责任，应该胜过他们对于揭露自己政府的军事秘密的顾虑。委员会和这几个空军人员的谈话，大部分是采用问答方式，但是每个空军人员在开始谈话时都先发表一个声明，其内容与他的书面供词相符，最后则郑重表示他的信念是他的良心所驱使的。
    他们的声明（ISCK/4及5）和包含这次晤谈主要内容的述评，既然都列为附件（附件三十九、四十、四十一），在这里就不需要多讲了。但从他们的书面声明和对问题的回答，已可以了解美国空军在一九五一年末和一九五二年初是在做些什么。这可以从下表看出来：
    一九五一年六月——克尼斯在美国听劳瑞讲演，他讲细菌战，说因为敌人可能使用细菌战。
    八月二十五日——伊纳克在日本听威尔逊讲演，他说美国没有进行细菌战的计划，但是敌人可能用它。
    十月——伊纳克在朝鲜听伯郎宁的细菌战讲演，声明与上同。
    十二月一日——奥尼尔在美国听威廉讲演，未肯定说美国是否将用细菌战。
    十二月——伊纳克在朝鲜又听伯郎宁细菌战讲演，声明与以前相同。
    十二月十八日——奎恩在朝鲜听艾世福克讲演，他说必须准备细菌战，敌人可能用它。
     一九五二年一月三日——奎恩第一次飞行投掷细菌弹，下令时和报告时，都说“不爆炸的炸弹”，但他从其他的情况，已知道这种“不爆炸的炸弹”是什么东西。
    一月六日——伊纳克第一次飞行投掷细菌弹，下令时说“细菌弹”，报告时说“不爆炸的炸弹”。
    一月二十二日——奥尼尔在朝鲜听麦克拉格林讲演，他肯定地说将使用细菌战。
    二月十五日——奥尼尔第一次飞行投掷细菌弹，下令时说“细菌弹”，报告时说“空中爆炸的定时炸弹”。
    二月十八日——奥尼尔看到了特制的飞机使用喷雾法散布细菌的证据。
    二月二十二日——克尼斯在美国听何礼门讲演，他明白否认使用细菌战，但承认美国拥有细菌武器。
    三月二十一日——克尼斯在朝鲜听麦克拉格林讲演，他肯定说细菌战已自一月一日开始进行，明白说美国政府将尽可能继续否认。
    三月二十七日——克尼斯第一次飞行投掷细菌弹，下令时说是“压制高射炮的炸弹”，报告时说“轰炸结果未观察”。
    从上列的事实，不能不得到这结论，即：对朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的命令一定是在一九五一年末发出的，事先叫空军人员听了谨慎的报道性的讲演，使他们有进行细菌战的准备，而不告知他们究竟要做什么，甚至一九五二年一月之后，直到他们实际到达朝鲜之时都是如此。在美国和日本的基地时，说细菌战是理论性的和纯粹防卫性的事情；可是到了朝鲜基地，驾驶员们很惊异地发现在他们到达几个星期或几个月前，细菌战已经开始了。这些航空员没有忽视这个事实，即：这个总的命令一定是在开城停战谈判期间发出的。
    此外，分开听取的各个空军人员的证词，有几点很有兴趣。值得注意的是：他们中间从来没有一个人受过有关战争公约和公认惯例的教育，如禁止枪杀俘虏，他们在其军队手册中也没有看见过这一类的规章，更没有听说过有某种战争方法是非法的，至少是被一些国家认为是非法的。他们的证词都一致表示进行细菌战的命令对其同伴的斗志发生极坏的影响。他们之中，有许多人对于被驱使在朝鲜屠杀朝鲜平民已极憎恨，细菌战的命令更使他们忍受不住了（附件四十一）。他们被俘放下武器后，朝鲜人和中国人待他们极友善，不再把他们看做敌人，他们转变态度是可以理解的。
    这几个军官对于细菌容器的种类知道的不多，这并不足为奇，因为他们都是领航员和驾驶员，军械人员的知识不会告诉他们，他们也只能揣测细菌武器的来源，有些人认为可能来自日本，这一点很重要。
    总之，经过多次的会谈及个人接触，委员会有充足的理由相信这几个士官是诚实而公正的。他们显得很正常和很健康，他们说话很自然，与其他在场的人同样的抽烟和喝茶。委员会再一次肯定地认为这些空军人员并未受到任何肉体和精神上的压力，而他们受到的待遇完全表示了中国人的最高贵的传统的人道主义。所以委员会认为空军们的证据是真实的和确凿的。这些证据在许多方面都使从现场考察而得的具有高度科学性和客观的证据更加充实。
    新中国的卫生
    委员会对于中国人民现在的卫生情况以及为提高卫生水准和抵抗疫病流行而采取的各种措施，有深刻的印象。这些措施，既有效而又彻底。西方流行着一种想法，以为中国人民生活的卫生情况很差；但是，只要亲自见到现在的情形以及中国人民执行政府的卫生指示的热诚，就足以打破过去的想法了
    （附件四十二）。
    在数年中的非常的进步，可以用几个数字来说明。在中国东北，于一九五一年间扑灭了三千五百万头鼠类，于一九五二年春季扑灭了一千万头——这样的消灭鼠类的斗争是世界各国所未有的。扑灭蝇子和其他能传播疾病的昆虫的斗争，也普及各地。北京现在已成一个几乎没有苍蝇和蚊子的城市了。在解放前，种牛痘的人很少，效率也低，接种牛痘人数量最多的一年（一九四六）也没有超过七百三十万人；但在解放后的三年中，种牛痘的人已有三万万七百万人，所以，天花几乎已完全绝迹。改造产婆，使婴儿因破伤风的死亡率自一九四九年至一九五一年间减少了三分之二。在同时期中，一般的婴儿死亡率和产妇死亡率减少了一半。许多中医已被动员起来协助这个伟大的卫生运动，事实证明了他们能够而且愿意接受新的医学教育，使他们能发挥作用。在北京和其他的大城市，流浪的狗已经几乎绝迹了，因为它们被疑是大脑炎病毒的储主以及许多传染病的带菌者。
    除此以外，制造疫苗和血清的生物制品所，其组织及其生产能力已大有进步。委员会在北京参观了一所这样的机关，对他们的工作效率，高额产量，和高度科学性的研究，有很好的印象。
    卫生运动并不限于北京或少数的“模范”城市。可靠的人士告诉我们说，这运动深入到这个大陆的最遥远的角落里。这一点，委员会全体在东北的旅行时，已经亲自看见。委员会在这次旅行中，到过了黑龙江省靠近内蒙古边界的遥远的地方。委员会对于各村庄的净洁具有深刻印象。
    解放以来，中国所进行的卫生教育运动，其范围之广泛，也许是举世无双的。全体人民，不论男女老幼，都全心全意地合作，这是获得这样结果的必要条件。凡为不断和迅速提高公共卫生的一般标准所应作的事情，全都想到，而且都全做得很起劲和彻底：如清除了堆积下来的垃圾，清扫院子和荒地，装置纱窗，捕杀各种毒虫，生产与使用杀虫剂和疫苗等等。用各种教育方式来推行基本卫生教育，如：群众大会、标语、画报、墙报、报纸、戏剧和电影。
    当遭遇到细菌战时，就是在起初怀疑它已经发生时，中国的农民群众们都已很正确的知道怎样去对付，毫无些微混乱或惊惶。委员会委员们自从与各方来的中国证人接触后，能看出千万人在中央和地方卫生部的指导下有纪律的行动，在田间和街上搜集并消毁任何从空中落下容器内的东西。
    今天中国在卫生上的进步，积极实行了各种卫生的措施，这些卫生措施正是历届国际卫生机关推动而又做不到的。如果中国政府不能获得各个阶层的人民底无条件的支持，是不能在这么短的时间内有这么大的进步。中国农民和产业工人，学者和宗教团体，都赞同政府目标并贡献他们最大的力量。
    概论
    现在将某些事实集合而制成表格是可以有所助益的。这不仅包括那些总结式的在布拉格文件中所发表的事实，并且包括那些在六、七与八月提出请委员会检查的事实。某些比较明显的事件列于附表
    （附件七）。每一案例中都记有参考文件编号、日期、地点及情况；是否注意到有飞机经过；是否看见有物体下落；是否找到容器；及什么地方见有昆虫或其他生物体反常地群集着。如可能并附注动物群集的密度。此后是昆虫学或动物学的鉴定，细菌学检验的结果，以及流行病学方面的附注。必须了解该表只包括已知事件的一小部分。
    从这个总结性的表格中可以了解，在查明带有致病细菌的生物物体出现之后，并不一定有患病者的案例随之而来。这必须归功于受害地区的人民，他们迅速地搜索和消灭任何异常的动物或有理由可认为是空投下来的物体。这些工作进行得这样有效，因此如附表所示，在许多案例中甚至不可能将标本保留下来，作为细菌学的分析。在其他的案例中，为了检查某种致病菌而做的细菌分析，产生了阴性结果。
    值得注意的是在这一年中，飞机侵入中国东北的次数之多，不可胜计。并且大半都不从事爆炸性轰炸。在二月二十九日到三月二十一日之间，有美机一百七十五组在中国东北上空作了九百五十五次袭击，包括辽东、辽西、吉林、松江和黑龙江省的七十个县区（SIA/3）。其他相似的数字亦已见于文件（NCNA/85；SIA/13）。侵犯中国领空最近非惟不见减少，且更是加紧。例如，到八月七日为止的八天中，美国飞机七十九组在中国领空曾作了三百九十八架次的突袭。
    在中国东北所发生事件的地理上分布是耐人寻味的（见地图附件七）。就以曾有详细分析的事件而说，至四月份为止，辽东省发生事件最多（十八件），它与朝鲜边界大部邻接。这儿显明的事实是几乎所有的事件都是在铁路和公路的附近地区发生的。值得注意的同样的特点可在最远的黑龙江省所发生的八个事件中见到。这儿在齐齐哈尔及哈尔滨的北面有一条铁路形成一个大的S形的弯曲，每边有一百五十多公里长——所发生的事件都是沿着这条线点上。
    以往刊布的文件，在一方面发表了些细菌学和流行病学方面的详细情形，联系了带菌的昆虫和患病者的案例；而另一方面提出了证据，联系了昆虫的出现和飞机的飞过。有时那些文件所供给的资料是不完备的，这是委员会要和中朝科学家合作，不厌详细的询问各项事件的理由之一；这些事件已详述于前几节中，即淮阳、甘南、宽甸、辽东、辽西、大同等事件。在所有的调查研究中，可以看出飞机、媒介物和患病者案例间的联系是无法再能争辩的了。
    在前面，分析事件的方法业经说明过了。现在是把经过最充分分析的案例中的资料，集合起来，总结成一个表格（第二百三十二页）的时候了。经过这个格式上的对照，一个有组织的计划已很明显地透露出来了。总是有人看见或听到飞机，它们的航行路线常常被绘制出来；而后来俘获的驾驶员的陈述增加了补充资料。以后在表上有落下容器的必要资料，所使用的媒介物以及他的反常情况，细菌学的试验和随之而来的临床病例。
    与这些事实相关的，委员会听取了和询问了许多普通的中国乡民。委员会的委员们相信这些证人的正直和忠厚，他们的证辞是坦白而清楚的。
    转到专门的问题，委员会曾经考虑朝鲜鼠疫是否可能从中国东北流行病区随交通而输入。有几点理由可以摒除这种可能性。第一、在朝鲜新发现鼠疫地区和上述地方流行区之间的地区，从来未曾报告过鼠疫的病例。第二、鼠疫的发生在季节上有着很严重的反常现象（参看附件七、十八及十九）。第三、鼠疫的一个特征是在人鼠疫流行之前，总先在鼠类中流行，但在朝鲜疫区并没有发现死鼠。第四、临床结果往往与飞机在事前的飞过并撒布相适应的媒介物、有明显的联系。最后，自开始到现在，在中国和北朝鲜的国境始终在执行着严格的卫生防疫工作。
    几种被应用的疾病不但与人有关，而且是与家畜有关的，例如炭疽病（NONA/85附件二十七）。当发现所投撒的某种媒介物上带有出血性败血病巴氏杆菌（Pasteurella Multocida）的事实被证实了以后（参看附件七表格），最初看来其重要性似很小，因为这是实验室动物中的一种很普通的感染。可是，设想它可能被用来做杀害牲畜的武器，是具有充分理由的（附件四十三）。
    至于霍乱弧菌，虽然它在上述业经详细讨论过的案例中（大同事件）是在被污染的软体动物里发现的，但从昆虫中，尤其是从蝇子里找到这种病菌，已不仅是数例而已（附件七）。沙门氏伤寒和副伤寒杆菌，以及志贺氏痢疾杆菌也是如此。在有些地区发现的蝇群中找到这些病菌，而这些地区并没有患者案例。因此引起一个问题，即在随地采集的普通蝇子体内或体外，是否可能存有病菌的问题。在这次战事多年以前，在中国医学文献里曾经发表的研究（附件四）正可用以对照。这些文件指明在非疫病流行时期之内，普通的蝇子并不携带伤寒杆菌、副伤寒杆菌或霍乱弧菌。有关的附件中有本年在沈阳进行的类似的研究记录。
    （附图表）
    一个与此有关的问题，就是应用定量研究方法检定昆虫携带的细菌；这项材料将在一专件（附件三）中叙述之。
    关于昆虫传病媒介部分，必须做一点补充，使布拉格及其他文件里已经说过的资料更成为完整。有一个附件（八）会专论被撒布的昆虫的鉴定；另一附件（二）可以帮助读者一般地了解与细菌战有关的医学昆虫学的问题。
    在以前的报告里有一些还未解决的问题，尤其是关于在朝鲜所发生的事件。因此，当委员会在平壤的期间，曾向保健相李炳南提出一连串的问题，他对这些问题都及时地做了答复（附件九）。看来过去的译文是有些错误的。在朝鲜的第一个报告里（SIA/1）所用的“蜱”字实际是指红蜘蛛（Trombicula akamushi）。关于同一文件所讲的寄生于蝙蝠的蝇子（Nycteribiidae sp. ），有资格的朝鲜权威人士告诉委员会，现在不能够肯定这些昆虫是与细菌战有关的。
    关于不仅一次在山坡上找到污染有沙门氏菌与志贺氏菌的死鱼的记载，已经获得了确证。应重视的事实是这些死鱼都是在饮用水源的邻近发现的。关于这点可以回想到委员会所详细研究过的大同事件（附件三十），这散布霍乱的意图是很明显不过地显现出来了。
    特别引起西方科学家们好奇心的，也是委员会严重地关切的一个问题，就是关于在飞机飞过之后发现的冷冻干燥蛋白质物体的问题（NCNA/85）。这种物质是成块的，容易胶粘和反潮，落在雪面上即吸收水分。化学分析结果表明，这是蛋白质分解物——?、胨、胜——所制成。细菌学家们从这里分离出可以使甘露醇发酵的痢疾杆菌。委员会在朝鲜工作的期间，这种事件未曾发生过，因此它得依靠朝鲜的工作报告；不过它认为保健相自己所接受的判断，完全是有可能性的，就是说，这种物体即是投撒的冷冻干燥的细菌培养。
    关于在很低的温度的环境条件下撒布昆虫的问题，委员会指出，在被俘空军供词里，他们提出证据说明生产特赋抗冷力的昆虫的方法（附件三十九）。
    上节（第一百九十八页），曾描述及由飞机播散的十八种昆虫和蜘蛛。就中九种业经细菌学检定确实证明染有致病微生物。其他的种类如何呢？委员会不能下结论说它们完全未受感染。当没有人确实知道去检查什么的时候，从物体上分离致病微生物将是很困难的事，尤其是对象是经过人工选择的细菌和病毒。没有考虑到的可能性还有许多。
    美国关于细菌战的文献与在朝鲜发生的事情有所抵触。在这些著作中所发表的某些看法，在没有被淘汰以前，它是和委员会的观察难以符合的。看来在某些重要的案件中，技术上的进步已经使这些看法过时了。鼠疫的案件可称典型。十年前罗斯伯利曾谨慎地表示意见说，鼠疫可以有效的散播以为战争之用；但是只能用于距离前线很远的地区，因为有很大的危险使友区也受到感染。在朝鲜，委员会的调查显示了曾不止一次地将鼠疫散播在离前线不远的地区内，这是和狄特里克兵营的前主任，有经验的细菌学家的意见相违反的。但是这种抵触只是表面的。近十年来，消毒的技术有了极大的进步；一方面，新的、效力更大的杀虫剂，配成各种的混合物；另一方面，用有高效能的手摇机械，可以喷撒大量云雾状物质在很短时间内进行消毒，而这些机械的简单程度可以到一个普通人就能自如地运用它。它们是第二次世界大战中所发明的烟幕放散器演变而成的。
    实际的经验证明这些方法可以用来消灭整个地区里的昆虫传播的疾病。最近发表的资料指出朝鲜美军拥有这种器械，并着重指出它的重要性，因为
    “在任何未来的战争里，普通的和正常的方法也许不足以应付那个局面”。
    这些记录足够解释文献和现场事实的表面矛盾。即使是部分的也罢，它们可以应用于一切其他带菌昆虫所传染的疾病，并帮助解释在朝鲜所见的使用昆虫媒介物的一般倾向。所举的例是典型的；我们不能将细菌战的可能性，限于在自然情况下的陈旧的看法，技术的和科学的进步将可以做到的范围扩大了；并且，像现在的例子，也解说了表面矛盾。在朝鲜，美国方面几乎是全部地控制了传播疾病的昆虫，就说明文献中的保留看法是错了。根据同样理由，委员会不同意那些认为将细菌、病毒和毒素作雾状喷撒是细菌战唯一有效方法的意见。因此，日本人的经验（参考以上第一百九十五页），在新的水平上，现在是可以使用的。
    但是，委员会所检察的案件之一就是中国东北的沈阳市及鞍山所流行的脑炎（SIA/3；8；00010），显示病毒可能已被以喷雾法直接撒布了。对这事件，委员会未能得到一个确定的结论，因为疾病和空袭之间的确实关系未能建立。可是，证据确是使人困惑，所以将全部有关文件放入附件
    （ISCC/6三十二、三十三、三十四、三十五）中。
    委员会不能向世界提供下面各项的具体数字：朝鲜和中国被杀害的平民的总数，总发病率，及死亡率等等。那样做是不适宜的，因为那就是向应负事件责任的方面供给以最后的重要资料。对委员会被邀请发表专家意见来证明案件来说，这些资料并非必要。所需要知道的，是委员会所证实的：即在个别地点及流行区，有许多人是在极不正常情况下死亡的，而归根到底是归因于美国空军的活动。重要的是全世界必需警惕那些业经发生并在继续发生中的事实。全世界人民必需注意这种战争的潜力，和它的几乎是无法计算的危险。
    结论
    自从一九五二年初以来，在朝鲜北部和中国东北，发生极反常的现象，使朝中两国的人民和政府指责美国军队在进行细菌战。为调查有关细菌战的事实而组织的国际科学委员会，在现场进行了两个多月的工作之后，现已结束工作。
    有大批事实摆在委员会面前，其中，有一些事实，首尾连贯，富有高度说明性，足为例证。所以，委员会特别集中力量来研究这些事实。
    委员会已得出下面的结论：朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标；美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成的。
    委员会是经过逻辑的步骤而后达到这些结论的。这种遭各国人民一致谴责的灭绝人性的手段，竟见诸施用，此为本委员会的委员们过去所不易置信；现在本委员会迫于事实，必须下这些结论。
    现在，全世界的人民都应加倍努力，使世界免遭战祸，并制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类。                 （新华社）
