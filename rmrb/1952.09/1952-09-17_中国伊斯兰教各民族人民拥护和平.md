We, the people of all Islamic nationalities in China, warmly welcome the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and hope for its successful conclusion.

The people of the ten minority nationalities in China who believe in Islam have suffered immensely under the long-term adverse environment of national discrimination and class oppression. We have always been in an inferior position politically, economically, culturally, and educationally. In the era of reactionary rule, especially during the dark era of Chiang Kai-shek, we, like the working people of the whole country, suffered exploitation, oppression, and slaughter, and our freedom of religious belief was also restricted.

Imperialism has long invaded China and enslaved the Chinese people, and the people of our Islamic nationalities have suffered even more deeply, because in addition to oppression and plunder, imperialist missionaries have consistently attacked our Islamic faith and often slandered our beloved Prophet Muhammad. The Japanese invading army not only slaughtered us, but also used airplanes to bomb mosques in Changde, Hunan, and Wanxian, Sichuan. They implemented a brutal "Three Alls" policy everywhere: kill all, loot all, burn all. They did not ask which nationality we were or what religion we believed in. During the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the loss of life and property of the Chinese people was incalculable.

We, the people of all Islamic nationalities, unanimously oppose imperialist wars of aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war. Therefore, we participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Since the American war-mongers launched the Korean War and occupied our territory of Taiwan, the Chinese people have launched a vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea. The people of the whole country have increased production and practiced thrift to support the front lines. Countless Islamic young men and women have gone to the forefront of national defense to participate in the just war against aggression. We want to contribute all our strength to defend the security and peace of Asia.

How can we not do our utmost to defend the security and peace of Asia?

Since the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the people of our Islamic nationalities have stood up and become masters of their own destiny. Our representatives—national representatives and religious representatives—participated in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and formulated the Common Program. The Common Program clearly stipulates: all nationalities within the People's Republic of China are equal; regional autonomy should be implemented in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities; all minority nationalities have the freedom to maintain or reform their customs and religious beliefs; the People's Government should help the masses of minority nationalities to develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction. In the short span of three years, due to the correct implementation of these policies by the people's governments at all levels, our political status has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Our appropriate number of representatives are in power organs at all levels, and there are staff members who believe in Islam in administrative organs at all levels. People's governments at all levels respect our religious beliefs and customs. Every time the three major festivals of Islam—the Prophet's Birthday (maulidal-Nabiyy), Eid al-Fitr (id al-fitr), and Eid al-Adha (id al-adhal)—come around, all schools, institutions, and enterprises give Islamic students or staff members in their units a day off so they can enjoy the holidays. Cattle and sheep slaughtered during these three major festivals are all tax-exempt. The internal buildings of mosques are also tax-exempt. Minority nationality autonomous regions have been gradually established, and people of all nationalities manage their own affairs under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. In the past, most of our minority nationality children could not afford to go to school, but now they have the opportunity to receive education, and they enjoy public funding in both universities and middle schools. The number of primary schools in various places has also increased significantly, and they have received strong support from the People's Government. Islamic intellectuals who were unemployed in the cities, after a short period of study, have been introduced to work in various administrative and enterprise organs, one after another, and they have received special care in their living habits. Poor Islamic farmers in the countryside have been allocated better land, houses, livestock, farm tools, and food in the land reform movement, and their patriotic enthusiasm and production enthusiasm have been greatly enhanced. We love our great motherland, we cherish the fruits of our revolution, and our greatest interest lies in building our motherland and improving our lives in a peaceful and unthreatened environment, so we must do our utmost to defend the security and peace of Asia.

Japanese imperialist elements once drove the Japanese people to carry out aggression in the Far East, causing great disasters to the people of our Asian countries. Now, the Japanese people are suffering enslavement and living a tragic colonial life, and their peaceful and democratic movements are being persecuted and suppressed. American aggressors are openly rearming Japan and secretly planning to use the Japanese army as their vanguard, and have released a large number of Japanese war criminals to command a huge armed force, preparing to drive them to attack the Soviet Union and China, and once again slaughter the good people of Asia and the Pacific region. The participation of Japanese troops in the Korean War has become an open secret. "Japan is now slowly returning to the path of war." (Associated Press, Tokyo, August 25th) Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida openly declared: "Japan should lead Asia." How rampant are the Japanese militarists! We support the great movement of the Japanese people to fight for independence, freedom, and democracy. We oppose American imperialism rearming Japan and invading Asia again. Therefore, we must do our utmost to defend the security and peace of Asia.

The Koran says: "O you who believe! Enter into peace, all of you." (2:208) We must, in accordance with our teachings, contribute all our strength and jointly defend the peace of Asia and the peace of the world with all the peace-loving people in Asia and the Pacific region.

    中国伊斯兰教各民族人民拥护和平
    北京回民抗美援朝会副主席  马坚
    我们中国伊斯兰教各民族人民，热烈欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，并希望会议胜利成功。
    中国信仰伊斯兰教的十个少数民族的人民，在长期的民族歧视、阶级压迫的恶劣环境中，受尽了人间的苦难。无论在政治上、经济上、文化上、教育上，我们向来都是居于劣等地位的。在反动统治时代，特别是在蒋介石统治的黑暗时代，我们和全国的劳动人民同样遭受剥削、压迫和屠杀，我们的宗教信仰自由也是受限制的。
    帝国主义长期侵略中国，奴役中国人民，我们伊斯兰教各民族人民受害更深，因为除了压迫和掠夺外，帝国主义的传教士们一贯攻击我们所信仰的伊斯兰教，经常诽谤我们所敬爱的先知穆罕默德。日本侵略军不但屠杀我们，而且用飞机炸毁了湖南常德和四川万县的清真寺，他们到处实行惨无人道的三光政策：杀光、抢光、烧光，他们并不问我们是那一个民族，信仰那一种宗教。在八年抗日战争期间，我们中国人民生命财产的损失，是无法估计的。
    我们伊斯兰教各民族人民一致反对帝国主义的侵略战争，反对蒋介石反人民的国内战争，因此，我们曾先后参加了抗日战争和解放战争。自美国战争贩子发动朝鲜战争，侵占我国领土台湾后，中国人民兴起了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，全国人民增产节约，支援前线，无数的伊斯兰教青年男女走上了国防的最前线，参加了反抗侵略的正义战争。我们要贡献我们所有的力量，保卫亚洲的安全与和平。
    我们怎能不以全力保卫亚洲的安全与和平呢？
    自中国人民革命胜利以来，我们伊斯兰教各族人民已经翻身做主人了。我们的代表——民族代表和宗教代表——参加了中国人民政治协商会议，制定了共同纲领，共同纲领明文规定：中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等；各少数民族聚居的地区，应实行民族的区域自治；各少数民族均有保持或改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由；人民政府应帮助各少数民族的人民大众发展其政治、经济、文化、教育的建设事业。在短短的三年期间，由于各级人民政府正确地执行了这些政策，我们的政治地位空前地提高了，各级政权机关中都有我们的适当的代表名额，各级行政机关中都有信仰伊斯兰教的工作人员。各级人民政府都尊重我们的宗教信仰和风俗习惯。每逢伊斯兰教的三大节日：圣诞节（maulidal-Nabiyy）、开斋节（id al-fitr）、宰牲节（id aladhal），各学校、各机关、各企业，都特为本单位的伊斯兰教学生或工作人员放假一天，让他们去欢度佳节。在这三大节日屠宰的牛羊，一律免税。清真寺内部的房屋也一律免税。少数民族自治区，已逐渐成立，各民族人民在中央人民政府统一的领导之下，各人管理自己的事情。我们少数民族的子女在过去大半是上不起学的，现在已经有了受教育的机会，无论在大学和中学都享有公费待遇了，各地的小学也大量地增加，而且获得人民政府的大力帮助。在城市里失业的伊斯兰教知识分子，经过短期的学习之后，一批又一批地被介绍到各行政机关和企业机关去担任工作，生活习惯上都获得了特别的照顾。在乡村里穷苦的伊斯兰教农民，在土地改革运动中，都分得了比较好的土地、房屋、耕畜、农具和粮食，他们的爱国情绪和生产情绪，大大地提高了。我们热爱我们伟大的祖国，我们珍惜我们革命的果实，我们最大的利益就是在和平而不受威胁的环境中建设我们的祖国，提高我们的生活，所以我们要以全力保卫亚洲的安全与和平。
    日本帝国主义分子曾驱使日本人民在远东进行侵略，使我们亚洲各国人民遭受了重大的灾难。现在，日本人民正在遭受奴役，过着殖民地的悲惨生活，他们的和平民主运动遭受迫害和镇压。美国侵略者公开地重新武装日本，秘密地计划把日本军队当做它的先锋部队，而且把大批的日本战犯释放出来指挥庞大的武装部队，准备驱使他们进攻苏联和中国，再来屠杀亚洲和太平洋区域的善良人民。日本部队参加朝鲜战争，已经成为公开的秘密，“日本现在已经慢慢地回到战争的轨道上来了。”（美联社东京八月二十五日电）最近，日本首相吉田茂公开地宣布：“日本应该领导亚洲。”日本军国主义者多么猖狂啊！我们支持日本人民争取独立、自由、民主的伟大运动，我们反对美帝国主义重新武装日本，再来侵略亚洲，所以，我们要以全力保卫亚洲的安全与和平。
    可兰经说：“信道的人们呀！你们应全体加入和平。”（二：二○八）我们要本着我们的教义，贡献我们所有的力量，与亚洲和太平洋区域爱好和平的一切人民共同保卫亚洲的和平和世界的和平。
