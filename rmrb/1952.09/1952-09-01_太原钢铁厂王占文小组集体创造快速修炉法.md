    Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Wang Zhanwen Group Collectively Creates Rapid Furnace Repair Method

    Editor: The Wang Zhanwen group of Class B of the electric furnace steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has created a rapid furnace repair method, shortening the medium repair time of electric furnaces from twenty-four hours to eight hours and fourteen minutes, which can increase steel production by 638 tons per year.

    In the past, the steelmaking department used to repair electric furnaces four times a month, each time taking twenty-four hours. However, since Class B accepted the medium repair task of electric furnaces on July 16, Wang Zhanwen mobilized all comrades in the class to find tricks to create a new furnace repair record. Therefore, ingot making, raw materials, crane, and sling bag teams all volunteered to participate in the furnace repair work. After everyone's research and discussion, the work was specifically divided according to the level of technology and the needs of the furnace repair work. The furnace repair task was completed in only eight hours and fourteen minutes. The main characteristics of this rapid furnace repair method are: 1. Take advantage of the furnace being red-hot to dismantle and beat the steel slag and residual steel stuck on the furnace door, because the slag is soft at high temperature and easy to dismantle and beat. 2. In the past, the furnace wall was built first, then the furnace was baked. Now, the furnace wall and furnace baking are built at the same time, and those with good technology are allowed to build the furnace baking, and those with poor technology are allowed to build the furnace wall, which increases the furnace building speed by one time. 3. Made a specific plan for the time required for each process of furnace repair, and carried out a scientific division of labor. Tai Steel

    太原钢铁厂王占文小组集体创造快速修炉法
    编辑同志：太原钢铁厂电炉炼钢部乙班王占文小组创造了快速修炉法，把中修电炉时间从二十四小时缩短到八小时零十四分，每年可增产六百三十八    吨钢。
    从前炼钢部每月中修四次电炉，每次需二十四小时，但自七月十六日乙班接受电炉中修任务后，王占文就动员全班同志找窍门，创造修炉新纪录。于是制锭、原料、天车、吊包等小组都提出自愿参加修炉工作，经过大家研究讨论，按技术高低和修炉工作的需要具体分了工，仅在八小时十四分就完成了修炉任务。这种快速修炉法的主要特点：一、趁着炉子赤热时，就拆打黏在炉门上的钢渣和残钢，因温度高了渣子软，容易拆打。二、从前是先打炉墙后砌炉烘，现在是同时砌炉墙、炉烘，并让技术好的砌炉烘，技术差的砌炉墙，提高砌炉速度一倍。三、对修炉的每个过程所需时间，作了具体计划，并进行了科学的分工。  太钢
