    Xinyang City "Five-Anti's" Office's Self-Criticism Regarding Irresponsible Handling of Mass Letters

    Editor: The criticism made by the Xinyang Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate, published on August 23rd in the People's Daily "Reader's Letters" page, regarding the Xinyang City "Five-Anti's" Office's seriously irresponsible handling of mass letters, is correct. We sincerely accept this criticism.

    During the "Five-Anti's" Movement, our city's "Five-Anti's" Office received over 10,000 pieces of accusation materials from the masses. Although the office initially had a materials team, its actual work was limited to receiving and forwarding, transferring most of the materials to the "Five-Anti's" guidance stations for processing and resolution. Furthermore, a strict receiving and dispatching system was not established. In mid-May, the materials team was dissolved, and all personnel managing materials took all materials with them to work at various guidance stations. After that, the office had no dedicated personnel responsible for handling materials; whoever received them handled them, with no receiving or dispatching procedures or registration system whatsoever. The management of materials was extremely chaotic. In early June, the Xinyang Branch of the Henan Provincial People's Procuratorate came to inquire about the handling of accusation materials transferred by them. We did not pay attention and felt it would be difficult to sort out the materials, so we simply tidied up the existing materials, hoping to muddle through. After repeated urging from the Procuratorate, we finally organized a force in July to conduct a more comprehensive investigation of the accusation materials from the masses at various guidance stations.

    Our irresponsible attitude towards handling accusation materials from the people is a manifestation of a lack of a mass viewpoint. This mistake has affected the connection between the People's Government and the people. In addition to sincerely accepting the correct criticism from the Xinyang People's Procuratorate and making a deep self-criticism, we are determined to earnestly correct this mistake in future work.

### 信阳市“五反”办公室对群众来信不负责任的检讨

    信阳市“五反”办公室对群众来信不负责任的检讨
    编辑同志：八月二十三日人民日报“读者来信专页”登载的河南省人民检察署信阳分署对信阳市“五反”办公室处理群众来信严重不负责任的批评，是正确的。我们诚恳接受这个批评。
    我市“五反”办公室在“五反”运动中，先后收到群众检举材料一万余件。办公室初期虽然设有材料组，但实际工作只是收收转转，把大部材料转给“五反”指导站处理解决；并且也没有建立严格的收发制度。五月中旬，材料组撤销，所有管理材料人员随带全部材料，分至各指导站工作。此后，办公室就无专人负责处理材料，谁收着、谁就处理，根本没有收发手续和登记制度。在材料管理上极其紊乱。六月初，河南省人民检察署信阳分署来催查他们转来的群众检举材料的处理情况。我们并未引起注意，认为材料不好清理，只是把现有材料清理一下，想应付了事。经该署多次督促，我们才在七月间组织力量到各指导站把群众检举材料作了较全面的清查。
    我们这种对处理人民群众检举材料不负责任的态度，是缺乏群众观点的表现。这种错误，影响了人民政府和人民群众的联系。我们除了诚恳接受信阳人民检察分署对我们的正确批评、作深切检讨外，并决心在今后的工作中切实改正这种错误。
                    信阳市“五反”办公室
