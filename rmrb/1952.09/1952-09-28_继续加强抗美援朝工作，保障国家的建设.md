    Continue to Strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea Work and Guarantee National Construction

    In two more days, it will be our country's third National Day. Over the past three years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved great accomplishments in all aspects. We have completed a series of social reforms through many great movements such as Resist-America, Aid-Korea, land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, ideological remolding, and judicial reform. We have completed the restoration and transformation of the national economy and fundamentally improved the nation's financial and economic situation. In addition, we have initially improved the people's living standards and developed cultural and educational undertakings. In this way, we have completed ahead of schedule the task proposed by Chairman Mao in June 1950 of striving for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation within about three years, thereby enabling our country to possess the conditions for large-scale construction. In the future, the long-term central task of the Chinese people is to continue to consolidate national defense, safeguard peace in the Far East and the world; and comprehensively and systematically carry out large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, and strive for the industrialization of the country. Now the people of the whole country are welcoming this glorious and great task with great enthusiasm and confidence.

    However, as we prepare to welcome large-scale national construction, we must also pay attention to another situation our country is currently facing, which is that: American imperialism is still continuing to delay and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations and is carrying out various military provocations, plotting to expand the war of aggression against Korea. In addition, American imperialism is still occupying our territory of Taiwan and is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarist forces, attempting to use Japan to launch aggression. This makes our country's security and peace in the Far East still under serious threat. Therefore, we must continue to strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work, continue to consolidate national defense, support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, strive for a victorious end to the Korean War and a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and safeguard our country's security and peace in the Far East and the world.

    Since the Chinese People's Volunteers went to Korea to fight in 1950, we have achieved great victories in the struggle to Resist-America, Aid-Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army together have driven the American aggressors from the Yalu River to the vicinity of the 38th parallel and forced the enemy to sit down for armistice negotiations. From October 1950 to August this year, the enemy has been eliminated and wounded up to 600,000 people, including more than 260,000 American aggressors. The enemy is now experiencing great difficulties, and the Korean war situation has stabilized. The inhumane bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors has also been crushed by the Chinese and Korean people. This great victory of the Chinese and Korean people is an important condition for guaranteeing the smooth progress and rapid completion of our country's restoration and reform work. Obviously, without the great victory of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle, we would not be able to carry out and complete our country's restoration and reform work. It is precisely because we have achieved the great victory of Resist-America, Aid-Korea, defended North Korea, defended China's security and peace in the Far East, that we have been able to smoothly carry out the country's restoration and reform work, and the rapid completion of our country's restoration and reform work has become possible.

    The great victory of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle has not only guaranteed the smooth progress of our country's restoration and reform work, but has also directly promoted the advancement of the country's restoration and reform work. In order to strongly support the just battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army on the Korean battlefield, the people of the whole country launched a vigorous Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement. This movement greatly enhanced the Chinese people's level of awareness and organization, and increased their enthusiasm for work and labor. This awareness and enthusiasm of the Chinese people has become a great force for promoting the rapid progress of the country's various construction and reform work. The great achievements made by the Chinese people in the signature campaign to defend peace, the donation campaign for weapons, the campaign for increased production and thrift, and the patriotic health campaign are vivid proof of this great force.

    In the past, we have victoriously carried out the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle on the one hand, and smoothly completed the country's restoration and reform work on the other. In the future, we must begin to carry out large-scale national construction work while continuing to strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle. As long as the US government does not change its unreasonable policy of delaying and sabotaging the Korean armistice negotiations, and the Korean armistice is not achieved, we must never relax and must continue to strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work; even if the Korean armistice is achieved, but as long as the Korean issue and other important Far Eastern issues closely related to the Korean issue are not completely resolved peacefully, we still cannot relax in the slightest and must continue to strengthen our Resist-America, Aid-Korea work.

    How should we continue to strengthen the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work? First, we must regularly carry out Resist-America, Aid-Korea propaganda and education work among the people. We should regularly, according to the development of the Resist-America, Aid-Korea struggle and international current affairs, expose the war plots and shameless crimes of American imperialism to the people, point out the current tasks of defending peace and opposing American aggression, and encourage the people of the whole country to actively struggle to realize this task. Second, we should mobilize the people of the whole country to vigorously carry out the patriotic campaign for increased production and thrift under the patriotic slogan of strengthening the Resist-America, Aid-Korea work, and actively carry out national construction work and national defense construction work, so as to support the Chinese People's Volunteers with greater strength. Third, we must earnestly do a good job in providing preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of servicemen, and in comforting the wounded and sick. Great achievements have been made in this work in the past, and we must improve this work even better in the future. Fourth, we must continue to carry out the patriotic health campaign, make this movement regular and lasting, so as to completely smash the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism, and continue to promote the health and hygiene of our people. Fifth, we must continue to strengthen and improve the patriotic pact system and the "Patriotic Day" system. Past experience has proved that promoting the patriotic pact and Patriotic Day system is an important method for educating and uniting people from all walks of life to actively carry out various patriotic work. In the future, we should continue to attach importance to promoting these two systems. We should earnestly implement the system of checking and revising patriotic pacts, and combine the patriotic pact system with the "Patriotic Day" system, using the time of "Patriotic Day" to check the implementation of patriotic pacts; closely combine the patriotic pact system with the campaign for increased production and thrift, and use patriotic pacts to promote the campaign for increased production and thrift. We believe that if we work hard to do these things well, we will definitely be able to continuously strengthen our Resist-America, Aid-Korea movement, and make this movement continue to become a great force for promoting the advancement of our country.

### 继续加强抗美援朝工作，保障国家的建设

    继续加强抗美援朝工作，保障国家的建设
    再过两天，就是我国第三届国庆节了。三年来，我国人民在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，在各方面都取得了伟大的成就。我们已通过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命、“三反”、“五反”、思想改造和司法改革等许多伟大的运动，完成了一系列的社会改革工作。我们已完成了国家经济的恢复与改造工作，并使国家财政经济状况获得根本好转。此外，我们还初步地改善了人民生活，发展了文化教育事业。这样，我们就提前完成了毛主席在一九五○年六月所提出的在三年左右的时间内争取财政经济情况的根本好转的任务，从而使我国具备了进行大规模建设的条件。今后我国人民长期的中心任务，就是继续巩固国防，保卫远东及世界的和平；全面地有计划地进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设，为国家的工业化而奋斗。现在全国人民正以极大的热情和信心来迎接这一光荣而伟大的任务。
    但是，在我们准备迎接国家大规模建设的时候，我们同时必须注意到我国目前所处的另外一种情况，这就是：美帝国主义现在仍在继续拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，并进行各种军事挑衅，阴谋扩大侵朝战争。此外，美帝国主义现在仍侵占着我国领土台湾，并在加紧复活日本军国主义势力，企图利用日本发动侵略。这就使我国安全和远东的和平仍然受着严重的威胁。因此，我们必须继续加强抗美援朝工作，继续巩固国防，支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，争取朝鲜战争的胜利结束和朝鲜问题的和平解决，保卫我国的安全和远东及世界的和平。
    从一九五○年中国人民志愿军赴朝作战以来，我们已在抗美援朝的斗争中取得伟大的胜利。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在一起，已把美国侵略军从鸭绿江边打退到三八线附近，并迫使敌人坐下来进行停战谈判。从一九五○年十月到今年八月，敌人已被消灭和杀伤达六十万人，其中包括美国侵略军在二十六万人以上。敌人现在已感到极大困难，朝鲜战局已稳定下来。美国侵略者所进行的灭绝人性的细菌战也已被中朝人民粉碎。中朝人民的这一伟大胜利，是保障我国恢复及改革工作顺利进行和迅速完成的一个重要条件。很显然，如果没有抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，我们就无法进行和完成我们国家的恢复和改革工作。而正是因为我们取得了抗美援朝的伟大胜利，保卫了北朝鲜，保卫了中国的安全和远东的和平，我们才能够顺利地进行国家的恢复和改革工作，我国恢复和改革工作的迅速完成才成为可能。
    抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，不仅保障了我国恢复及改革工作的顺利进行，而且也直接地推动了国家恢复及改革工作的前进。为了有力地支持中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军在朝鲜战场上的正义战斗，全国人民展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动。这一运动，极大地提高了中国人民的觉悟程度和组织程度，提高了他们工作和劳动的积极性。中国人民的这种觉悟和积极性就成为推动国家各种建设和改革工作迅速前进的伟大力量。中国人民在保卫和平签名运动、捐献武器运动、增产节约运动及爱国卫生运动中所获得的巨大成绩，就是这一伟大力量的生动证明。
    过去我们已经一面胜利地进行抗美援朝的斗争，一面顺利地完成了国家的恢复及改革工作。今后我们要在继续加强抗美援朝斗争的情况下，开始进行大规模的国家建设工作。只要美国政府不改变其拖延和破坏朝鲜停战谈判的无理政策，朝鲜停战没有获得实现，我们就绝对不能放松，必须继续加强抗美援朝工作；即使朝鲜停战实现了，但只要朝鲜问题以及与朝鲜问题密切相关的其他远东的重要问题未彻底获得和平解决，我们就仍然不能丝毫放松，必须继续加强我们的抗美援朝工作。
    我们应当怎样继续加强抗美援朝工作呢？第一，要经常地在人民群众中进行抗美援朝的宣传教育工作。应该经常根据抗美援朝斗争及国际时事的发展，向人民揭露美帝国主义的战争阴谋和无耻罪行，指明当前保卫和平与反对美国侵略的任务，鼓励全国人民为实现这一任务而积极斗争。第二，应该动员全国人民在加强抗美援朝工作的爱国主义口号下，努力开展爱国增产节约运动，积极进行国家建设工作和国防建设工作，以更大的力量支持中国人民志愿军。第三，要认真做好优待革命烈士家属、军人家属的工作和慰问伤病员的工作，过去这一工作已取得很大成绩，今后要更好地改进这一工作。第四，要继续开展爱国卫生运动，使这一运动经常化和持久化，以便彻底粉碎美帝国主义的细菌战，并继续推进我国人民的保健卫生事业。第五，要继续加强和改进爱国公约制度和“爱国日”制度。过去的经验证明，推行爱国公约和爱国日制度是教育和团结各界人民积极进行各项爱国工作的重要方法，今后应该继续重视推广这两种制度。应该认真执行检查和修订爱国公约的制度，并使爱国公约制度和“爱国日”制度结合起来，利用“爱国日”的时间去检查爱国公约的执行状况；使爱国公约制度和增产节约运动密切结合起来，用爱国公约去推动增产节约运动。我们相信，努力做好这些工作，就一定可以使我们的抗美援朝运动不断地加强起来，并使这
    一运动继续成为推动我们国家前进的伟大力量。
