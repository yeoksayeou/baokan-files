Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 11th: The American aerial bandits' indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages in Korea, especially the bloody atrocities of continuously and frantically massacring residents of Pyongyang City, has aroused the boundless indignation of the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In addition to fighting more bravely to kill the enemy and avenge the dead Korean peaceful residents, they also sent representatives to Pyongyang to express their condolences to the people of Pyongyang City, and donated 300 tons (600,000 jin) of grain saved recently to the deeply affected refugees in Pyongyang City to help them overcome difficulties in their lives.

    The ceremony for donating this batch of grain was held at the Pyongyang City People's Committee on the afternoon of the 9th. Those who attended the ceremony included Kim Song-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee; Jang Jong-hyun, Vice-Chairman of the Pyongyang City Committee of the Korean Workers' Party; Hong Ki-hwang and Lim Seung-dam, Vice-Chairmen of the City People's Committee; and more than 100 representatives from democratic parties, social organizations, people from all walks of life in Pyongyang City, as well as staff members of state power organs.

    At the beginning of the ceremony, Zhang Tianmin, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said in his speech: The American invading bandits' large-scale bombing of the Pyongyang area and massacre of peaceful residents of Pyongyang City does not indicate the enemy's strength. On the contrary, it shows the heavy defeat suffered by American imperialism in the more than two years of its war of aggression against Korea. This crime of the enemy has not only aroused the boundless anger of the Korean military and civilians and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Chinese people, but has also aroused the unusual indignation of all peace-loving people in the world. For this reason, all commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army are further enhancing their heroic fighting spirit to kill the enemy. We are donating 600,000 jin of biscuits, fried rice, and fried noodles saved in recent times to the refugees in Pyongyang City to help our Korean friends overcome the difficulties in life caused by the invaders' indiscriminate bombing, and to thank the heroic people of Pyongyang City for their enthusiastic care and support for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. We firmly believe that the more brutal the enemy is, the more tenacious the fighting will of the heroic Korean people and the people of Pyongyang City will become. The strong unity between the Chinese and Korean people will surely defeat the American aggressors in the end.

    Subsequently, Kim Song-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, said in his reply: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is not only fighting side by side with the Korean People's Army on the front lines, heroically striking the American armed aggressors, but also warmly assisting us materially and spiritually. This year, when welcoming the second anniversary of "June 25th," the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sent 200 tons of grain to relieve the refugees in Pyongyang City. Recently, due to the barbaric bombing by the American invading bandits, the lives of the citizens have been greatly affected, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army has again sent 300 tons of saved grain. On behalf of the Pyongyang City People's Committee and all the people of Pyongyang City, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Chinese people, and their great leader Chairman Mao Zedong for their love for the Korean people. Kim Song-hak called on the people of the city to intensify their efforts in increasing production and supporting the front lines, strengthen the struggle against air raids, and successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government to repay the deep concern and great assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Kim Song-hak personally presented a silk banner from the people of Pyongyang City to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The banner was embroidered with the words: "We express our heartfelt gratitude for your righteous act of sending a large amount of grain; we vow to dedicate all our strength to the final victory of the war."

    志愿军节约粮食六十万斤赠送平壤市难民
    【新华社平壤十一日电】美国空中强盗滥炸朝鲜和平城乡，特别是连续疯狂屠杀平壤市居民的血腥暴行，激起了中国人民志愿军指挥员和战斗员们的无比愤慨。他们除了更加奋勇杀敌，为死难的朝鲜和平居民报仇外；同时还派遣代表到平壤，慰问平壤市人民，并把最近期间节约的粮食三百吨（六十万斤），赠送给受害深重的平壤市难民，帮助他们克服生活上的困难。
    赠送这批粮食的仪式于九日下午在平壤市人民委员会举行。参加仪式的有平壤市人民委员会委员长金成学，朝鲜劳动党平壤市委员会副委员长张宗铉，市人民委员会副委员长洪基璜、林承淡与平壤市的各民主政党、社会团体、各界人民代表以及政权机关工作人员等一百多人。
    仪式开始时，中国人民志愿军代表张天民致词说：美国侵略强盗大规模地轰炸平壤地区屠杀平壤市和平居民的暴行，并不说明敌人力量的强大，恰恰相反，它说明了美帝国主义在两年多侵朝战争中所遭受的惨重失败。敌人这种罪行不但激起了朝鲜
    军民和中国人民志愿军以及中国人民的无比愤怒，而且已使全世界所有爱好和平的人民异常愤慨。我们志愿军全体指挥员和战斗员们，为此正在更加提高着英勇杀敌的斗志。我们把最近期间节约下来的饼干、炒米、炒面六十万斤，赠送给平壤市的难民，帮助朝鲜朋友克服由于侵略者的狂轰滥炸而遭受的生活上的困难，并借以答谢英雄的平壤市人民对于中国人民志愿军的热情爱护和支援。我们坚决相信敌人越是残暴，英勇的朝鲜人民及平壤市人民的斗争意志也将越发顽强。中朝两国人民的坚强团结一定能最后战胜美国侵略者。
    接着，平壤市人民委员会委员长金成学致答辞说：中国人民志愿军不但在前线和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，英勇打击美国武装侵略者；而且在物质上和精神上热烈地援助了我们。今年在迎接“六·二五”二周年的时候，中国人民志愿军曾送来二百吨粮食救济平壤市的难民。最近期间，由于美国侵略强盗的野蛮轰炸，市民的生活感到很大困难，中国人民志愿军又送来了三百吨节约的粮食。我谨代表平壤市人民委员会和平壤市全体人民向热爱朝鲜人民的中国人民志愿军和中国人民及其伟大领袖毛泽东主席，致由衷的谢意。金成学号召全市人民加紧进行增产和支援前线的工作，加强反空袭的斗争，胜利完成朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府所赋予的任务，来报答中国人民志愿军的深切关怀和大力援助。
    金成学亲自把平壤市人民献给中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员的一面锦旗递交给志愿军代表。锦旗上面绣着：“我们对于你们送来大批粮食的义举表示万分感激；我们誓为战争的最后胜利而献出一切力量”。
