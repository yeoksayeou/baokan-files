    Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: The unified national college entrance examination for this year has now been completed, and the admission lists will be published in newspapers in major administrative regions starting from September 26th. A total of 65,893 new students have been admitted nationwide, including 33,632 in engineering, 5,420 in science, 6,500 in medicine, 8,406 in teacher training (referring only to those recruiting high school graduates), 4,250 in agriculture and forestry, 3,760 in liberal arts, 2,770 in finance and economics, 720 in political science and law (referring only to those recruiting high school graduates), and 435 in the arts. The number of new students admitted this year is greater than the enrollment figures for the previous two years after liberation and far exceeds the enrollment figures for colleges and universities in any period of old China. The sharp increase in the number of new students admitted to schools once again demonstrates the superiority of the new democratic system: this system is increasingly increasing the opportunities for young people in our country, especially workers and peasants, to enter colleges and universities, bringing young people a broad path to master science and technology for the construction of the motherland.
    The country is now on the eve of large-scale economic construction, and there is an urgent need to cultivate various types of senior construction talents in a planned manner. Therefore, this year's college enrollment has great significance. As early as July, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, together with relevant departments, formed the National College Enrollment Committee, which formulated a unified enrollment plan for each school and each department nationwide, completely changing the blind phenomenon in previous enrollment work. The National College Enrollment Committee also established 89 examination areas in major cities and individual ethnic minority areas across the country, using unified test questions, so that students could take the exams in an orderly manner without having to travel long distances. Before the exam, the admissions committees and youth league organizations in each district conducted general education for the candidates to make them understand the significance and attitude of entering higher education. The Southwest and Northwest Administrative Regions organized summer study groups for all high school graduates and some social youths in the region. At the "Nanjing High School Graduate Student Study Class" jointly hosted by the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Culture and Education and the Municipal Committee of the Youth League, the leaders of the Communist Party and the People's Government and model workers all gave reports to the candidates. Newspapers and radio stations in various places have also increased the number of articles and programs on college entrance guidance. Encouraged by the construction of the motherland, young students are also determined to master science and technology to prepare to serve the motherland, and have shown a high degree of patriotism in entering higher education. After studying, the students all said: "The needs of the motherland are my aspirations." Among the application options, engineering is the most popular, accounting for 57.85% of the total, followed by medicine, accounting for 17.13% of the total, which is in line with national needs. The number of students applying for teacher training has also increased compared with previous years. For example, in the Southwest Region, only about 4% of students were originally willing to apply for teacher training, but after studying, the number increased to 16.6%.
    The combination of the needs of the motherland and the patriotic enthusiasm of young students has made this year's enrollment work unprecedented in scale. Students have actively signed up for the exam, and the number of applicants has exceeded the original plan by more than 10,000. This year, basically all high school graduates have applied, accounting for 65.8% of the applicants, and graduates from various secondary schools in previous years and students with equivalent qualifications accounted for 31%. Due to the increase in the number of applicants, after reviewing the test papers, the National College Enrollment Committee convened an enrollment and placement conference with the enrollment committees of various regions and representatives of relevant central departments; according to the instructions of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the meeting added 14,500 places to the enrollment plan according to national needs, and determined the principles and methods for examination and admission: that is, according to national needs (specifically reflected in the enrollment plan), referring to the candidates' wishes, unified examination and admission; those with the same wishes are prioritized based on academic performance, first in the department and then in the school; those who meet the admission standards but have poor grades will be appropriately assigned with reference to their wishes, region, and grades. Special care should be given to worker-peasant youth, families of martyrs, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese students, and they should be admitted leniently. The wishes of the industrial workers who applied should be fully taken into account, and they should be admitted to the relevant departments as soon as possible. After careful and prudent review after the meeting, a total of 65,893 new students were admitted, including entering cadres.
    After ideological transformation and departmental adjustments, colleges and universities have taken on a new look. At present, the schools are actively preparing for welcoming new students. After the great National Day holiday, more than 60,000 new students will enter colleges and universities from all parts of the motherland to study and master scientific knowledge and technology, and become the talents needed for the construction of the motherland.

    高等学校统一招生工作顺利完成
    全国录取新生达六万五千多人
    【新华社二十五日讯】全国高等学校今年统一招生工作现在已经完成，录取名单将于二十六日起在各大行政区报纸上分别公布。全国共录取了新生六万五千八百九十三人，其中工科三万三千六百三十二人，理科五千四百二十人，医科六千五百人，师范八千四百零六人（仅指招收高中毕业生），农林四千二百五十人，文科三千七百六十人，财经二千七百七十人，政法七百二十人（仅指招收高中毕业生），艺术四百三十五人。今年新生录取的这个数目大于解放后以往两年的招生数字，更远远地超过了旧中国任何时期高等学校的招生数字。学校录取新生名额的骤增，又一次显示了新民主主义制度的优越性：这个制度日益增加了我国青年特别是工农青年升入高等学校的机会，给青年带来了为祖国的建设而掌握科学和技术的宽广道路。
    全国现正处在大规模经济建设的前夕，迫切需要有计划地培养各类高级建设人材，因此，今年高等学校的招生就有着重大的意义。远在七月间，中央人民政府教育部就会同有关部门组成了全国高等学校招生委员会，按全国每个学校每个科系制定了统一的招生计划，完全改变了以往招生工作中的盲目现象。全国高等学校招生委员会同时又在全国主要城市及个别少数民族地区设立了八十九个考区，使用统一的试题，使学生不必长途跋涉而能够有秩序地进行考试。在考试前，各区招生委员会和青年团组织，为使考生明了升学的意义和应有的态度，向考生普遍进行了教育。西南、西北两大行政区组织了全区高中毕业生及部分社会青年的暑期学习团。在南京市人民政府文教局和青年团市工委共同主持的“南京市高中毕业学生学习班”上，共产党和人民政府的首长以及劳动模范都对考生作了报告。各地的报纸、广播电台等也都增加了升学指导的文章和节目。青年学生也因为受到了祖国建设事业的鼓舞，决心掌握科学技术准备为祖国服务，在升学中也表现了高度的爱国精神。经过学习后，学生们都表示：“祖国的需要就是我的志愿”。在报考志愿中，以工科为最多，占总数的百分之五十七·八五，医科次之，占总数的百分之十七·一三，这些都是符合国家需要的。报考师范的学生也比往年增加。如西南区愿投考师范的学生原来只有百分之四左右，经过学习后增加到百分之十六·六。
    祖国的需要与青年学生的爱国热情相结合，使今年的招生工作有了空前的规模，学生都踊跃地报名投考，报考人数超过了原来计划一万多人。今年高中毕业学生基本上已全部报考，占报考人数的百分之六十五·八，往年各类中等学校毕业生以及同等学力学生报考者占百分之三十一。由于报考人数的增加，在评阅试卷以后，全国高等学校招生委员会与各区招生委员会及中央有关部门代表召开了招生录取调配会议；根据中央人民政府教育部的指示，会议按国家需要追加了招生计划一万四千五百人，并确定了审查录取的原则和办法：即根据国家需要（具体体现在招生计划上），参考考生志愿，统一审查录取；志愿相同者以成绩优劣为序，先尽系科，后尽学校；合于录取标准但成绩较差，则参考其志愿、地区与成绩适当进行分配。对于工农青年、烈士家属、少数民族、华侨学生则加以照顾，从宽录取，对于报考的产业工人则充分照顾其志愿，尽先录取在有关的系科。会议后，经过周密慎重的审查，连同入学的干部共录取新生六万五千八百九十三人。
    经过思想改造和院系调整，高等学校已焕然一新。目前，各校正积极准备着迎新工作。伟大的国庆节日过后，六万多名新生将自祖国的各个地区进入高等学校，学习和掌握科学知识与技术，成为祖国建设所需要的人材。
