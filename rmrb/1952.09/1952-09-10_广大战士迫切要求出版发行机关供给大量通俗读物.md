The broad masses of soldiers eagerly demand that publishing and distribution organs supply a large number of popular readings
(I)
Comrades Editors: I am a cadre from the Cultural Publishing Department of the North China Military Region. After the cultural learning movement was widely launched in the army, in order to meet the reading needs of the soldiers, we needed to purchase a large number of popular readings. However, the publishing department is currently unable to fully supply the readings needed by the soldiers. Now I am telling you the situation, hoping that you will publish it so that publishing agencies in various places pay attention to this issue, so as to find ways to solve it as soon as possible.
In the past, our companies had a small number of popular readings, but because there were not many soldiers with reading ability, books were not felt to be lacking. Since the rapid literacy movement was launched in the army, most soldiers have improved their cultural level and can understand popular readings, and the rest will soon be raised to this level. In this case, all units urgently feel that there are too few books and have requested the higher military region to issue a large number of popular readings.
In order to meet the needs of the soldiers, our cultural publishing department of the North China Military Region has made a lot of efforts. In addition to issuing more newspapers and periodicals suitable for soldiers to read and compiling and printing popular small series, we have also actively tried to purchase readings from public and private bookstores in various places.
In the process of buying books, we quickly encountered difficulties. First of all, there are too few books suitable for soldiers to read. For example, we have selected popular readings in various bookstores in Beijing. Although the standards have been relaxed, it was only with great difficulty that two hundred and forty kinds of readings were selected, many of which were children's books. The soldiers felt very unfamiliar when they read them, and some were thin books with deeper content, which the soldiers felt were "pedantic" and difficult to understand. Secondly, among the existing books, the number that can be bought now is too small. Of the two hundred and forty kinds of books we selected, only fifty kinds were bought at that time, and only thirty-two kinds were bought in sufficient numbers. In June and July of this year, we took more than four hundred kinds of books from bookstores in Beijing, selected one hundred and seventeen kinds, and the bookstore has not yet fully supplied the books. In particular, those better readings are even more difficult to buy.
Of course, this is a temporary phenomenon during our cultural great march, and it is a difficulty in our progress. However, in order to better help soldiers continue to improve their cultural level and rapidly build a modernized national defense force, I suggest that publishing departments in various places pay special attention to this issue and quickly find ways to solve it.

Comrades Editors: I suggest that publishing and distribution agencies across the country pay attention to solving the problem of the supply of popular readings falling short of demand.
After the nationwide army launched a universal cultural learning movement, most soldiers learned more than two thousand characters and could read popular readings. After the soldiers learn culture, their desire for knowledge is amazing. They read books with relish. Many people save their allowances to buy books. However, in this case, the phenomenon of being unable to buy books has occurred everywhere. We first felt that there were too few types of books suitable for soldiers to read, and we couldn't buy new books. Later, even general popular readings were not easy to buy. As a result, some soldiers, because they were eager to read, wanted to buy old novels such as "Little Five Righteous Men" without discrimination. Although they did not buy them after we persuaded them. But this also shows that the lack of popular readings is an issue that cannot be ignored.
Based on this situation, I suggest that publishing and distribution agencies in various places should quickly find ways to solve this problem, reprint a large number of popular readings suitable for soldiers to read that have already been published, and widely distribute them to the troops. The cultural departments of the troops should subscribe to more newspapers and periodicals for the soldiers, and also run the troops' newspapers and periodicals well and compile more reading materials for the soldiers. I hope that the vast number of writers across the country can create more works for the soldiers, or abbreviate and adapt world literature works suitable for soldiers to read, and provide more cultural food for our lovely soldiers.

Comrades Editors: Currently, we are vigorously carrying out a cultural learning movement in our troops. After a short period of study, most comrades can generally read novels and various books, newspapers and magazines. Therefore, many comrades are eager to demand that a large number of their favorite readings be supplied for them to read. The books and periodicals published by the troops are limited and cannot meet the needs of the soldiers. Many soldiers are willing to take out their allowances to go to bookstores to buy books to read.
However, many of our troops are stationed far away from cities, and there are no Xinhua bookstores locally. During the current period of cultural learning, time is especially precious, and soldiers cannot take time off to go to the streets to buy books. Therefore, in our spare time for learning culture, we always lack books for self-study.
We suggest that Xinhua Bookstore organize a mobile sales service team of books and periodicals to sell books, periodicals and magazines to the troops' garrisons every Sunday. This will solve the soldiers' demand for buying books and help us improve our culture more quickly.

### 广大战士迫切要求出版发行机关供给大量通俗读物

    广大战士迫切要求出版发行机关供给大量通俗读物
    （一）
    编辑同志：我是华北军区文化出版部门的一个干部。在部队里普遍展开文化学习运动后，我们为了满足战士们的阅读要求，需要购买大量通俗读物。但出版部门目前还不能充分供给战士们需要的读物。现在我把情况告诉你们，希望你们发表，让各地出版机关重视这个问题，以便及早设法解决。
    过去我们各连队都有少数的通俗读物，但因有阅读能力的战士不多，书籍还不感缺少。自从速成识字运动在部队开展以来，大部分战士已经提高了文化水平，能够看懂通俗读物，而其余的也将很快被提高到这个水平。在这个情况下，各部队都迫切感到书籍太少，纷纷要求上级军区发给大量通俗读物。
    为了满足战士们的要求，我们华北军区的文化出版部门曾经作过不少的努力，除了增发适合于战士们阅读的报纸和刊物，自己编印通俗小丛书等外，还积极设法向各地公私营书店购买读物。
    在购书的过程中，我们很快地便遇到了困难。首先，适合战士们阅读的书籍太少。譬如，我们曾在北京市各个书店选购通俗读物。虽然放宽标准，但好容易才选到二百四十种读物，其中还有许多是儿童读物，战士们看了觉得很不亲切，还有一些是内容较深的薄本书，战士们看时也觉得“文绉绉的”，很难懂。其次，在已有的书籍中，现在就可以买到的数量太少，我们选的那二百四十种书籍，当时只买到了五十种，而且只有三十二种买够了数。今年六七月间，我们又从北京市各书店拿来四百多种书籍，选出了一百零十七种，到现在书店还没有把书配全。特别是那些比较好的读物，就更难买到。
    当然，这是我们在文化大进军时的一个暂时的现象，是我们前进中的困难。但是为了更好地帮助战士们继续提高文化水平，迅速建设现代化的国防军，我建议各地出版部门特别重视这个问题，迅速设法解决。　　　　　　　一读者

    编辑同志：我建议全国各地的出版发行机关注意解决通俗读物供不应求的问题。
    全国部队普遍开展文化学习运动后，大部分战士都学会了两千多个字，能看通俗读物了。战士们学习了文化后，求知的欲望是非常惊人的。他们读起书来，都是手不释卷，兴致勃勃。有许多人把津贴费都节省下来买了书。但在这种情况下却到处发生了买不到书的现象。我们先是感到适合战士们阅读的书的种类太少，买不到新书。后来，一般的通俗读物都不易买到了。这样，有些战士因为读书心切，便饥不择食地要买“小五义”等旧小说来看。虽然经过我们说服后，他们都没有买。但由此也可以看出通俗读物的缺乏已经是个不容忽视的问题。
    根据这个情况，我建议：各地出版发行机关应赶快想法解决这个问题，把已经出版的适合战士阅读的通俗读物大量再版，广泛向部队发行。部队文化部门应该为战士们增订报刊，并且办好部队报刊和多编战士读物。希望全国广大的作家们能够多多为战士们创作，或缩写、改编适合战士阅读的世界文学作品，把更多的文化食粮供给我们可爱的战士。

    编辑同志：目前我们部队中正在大力开展着文化学习运动。一般同志经过了短时期的学习后，普遍都能看小说和各种书报杂志。因此，许多同志都渴望要求有大量他们所喜爱的读物来供给他们阅读。部队出版的书刊有限，不能满足战士们的要求，很多战士都愿意拿出自己的津贴费到书店去买书看。
    但是，我们很多部队驻地离开城市很远，当地没有新华书店。在目前学习文化期间，时间特别宝贵，战士们不能抽时间请假上街去买书。因此，我们在学习文化的空余时间，总是缺少书籍自学。
    我们建议新华书店组织书刊流动推销服务组，每逢星期日到部队驻地推销书刊杂志。这样就可以解决战士们买书籍的要求，帮助我们更快地提高文化。
