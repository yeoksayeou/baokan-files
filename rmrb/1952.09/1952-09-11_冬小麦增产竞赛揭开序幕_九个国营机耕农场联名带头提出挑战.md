Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition has begun, with nine state-owned mechanized farms, three local state-owned farms, one agricultural production cooperative, and twelve mutual aid teams jointly initiating challenges.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government's "Opinions on Launching the 1953 Winter Wheat Patriotic Production Increase Competition" pointed out that wheat is one of China's main commercial grains, and increasing wheat production is of great importance to strengthening national economic construction and national defense, and improving people's lives. Therefore, in the winter wheat producing areas across the country, it is an effective method to organize and plan the widespread launch of the 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition, to give play to the patriotic labor enthusiasm of workers and staff of state-owned farms and the broad masses of peasants, and to implement effective methods for increasing wheat production.

The initiators of the 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition include, first, nine state-owned mechanized farms: Lutai Farm, Wulidian Farm, Shuangqiao Practice Farm of the Mechanized Farming School directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Dongxin Farm, Jiheng Farm, Yellow River Flood Area Farm, Lingwu Farm, Fufeng Farm, and Yongnian Farm. Among them, Shuangqiao Practice Farm's 259 mu of winter wheat in 1952 yielded an average of 182.3 jin per mu, exceeding the original plan by 21.5 percent. The Yellow River Flood Area Farm's more than 45,000 mu of winter wheat in 1952 yielded an average of 158.48 jin per mu, with the highest yield reaching 361 jin per mu. Although these state-owned farms have not been established for long, they all have large areas of cultivated land and use machine production, and have broad development prospects in tapping production potential and increasing yield per unit area. These nine state-owned farms plan to increase the yield per unit area of winter wheat in 1953 by 50 percent compared to 1952, and create new records of high yield and bumper harvests. Secondly, the initiators include three local state-owned farms: Laiwu County Farm in Shandong Province, Fangqiuhu Farm in Anhui Province, and Agricultural Experiment Farm in Southern Jiangsu. These local state-owned farms are now using new farm tools, applying agricultural science and technology experience, and actively implementing the policy of increasing yield per unit area. Laiwu County Farm's 110 mu of winter wheat in 1952 yielded an average of 303.5 jin per mu, and created a high yield record of 915 jin per mu. The farm plans to achieve an average of 450 jin per mu for more than 90 mu of winter wheat in 1953, which is more than 50 percent higher than the average yield of local farmers, and create a high yield record of 1,000 jin per mu on another ten mu of high-yield land. Fangqiuhu Farm in Anhui Province plans to sow 9,000 mu of winter wheat, with an average yield of 240 jin per mu, an increase of 30 percent compared to 1952, and 50 percent higher than the average yield of local farmers, and will designate 40 mu out of the 9,000 mu to create high yield records. The Agricultural Experiment Farm in Southern Jiangsu plans to achieve an average yield of 500 jin per mu for winter wheat in 1953. Another group of initiators are: Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zaoyan Village, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province; Li Entong Mutual Aid Team in Dongshisi Village, Wuzhi County, Pingyuan Province; Guo Jianwen Mutual Aid Team in Xibaishui Village, Wuzhi County, Pingyuan Province; Zhang Wuyou Mutual Aid Team in Xiajiluo Village, Zhaocheng County, Shanxi Province; Zhu Xianzong Mutual Aid Team in Qinying Township, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province; Cui Yuxia Mutual Aid Team in Wuzhai Village, Suining County, Northern Jiangsu; Zhang Benzhou Mutual Aid Team in Qiaoshang Village, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province; Wang Chuhua Mutual Aid Team in Sujiapo Village, Wendeng County, Shandong Province; Zhao Jinli Mutual Aid Team in Douma Village, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province; Xu Jingzhang Mutual Aid Team, Zhang Junxian Mutual Aid Team, Guo Baihe Mutual Aid Team in Yingtao Guo Township, Linying County, Henan Province; and Jin Yangen Mutual Aid Team in Fanlu Village, Nanhui County, Southern Jiangsu. These agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have gradually increased the yield per unit area by giving play to the superiority of organized collective production. In 1952, the yield of winter wheat for Guo Jianwen Mutual Aid Team in Xibaishui Village, Wuzhi County, Pingyuan Province, averaged 455.85 jin per mu, with 799 jin per mu on high-yield land; Li Entong Mutual Aid Team in Dongshisi Village in the same county averaged 413.3 jin per mu; Zhu Xianzong Mutual Aid Team in Qinying Township, Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, averaged 429 jin per mu, with 693 jin per mu on high-yield land; and the average yield of other teams and cooperatives ranged from more than 280 jin to 400 jin, and they also created some high-yield records. Based on different situations, they plan to increase the average yield of winter wheat in 1953 by 10 to 70 percent, and create high-yield records of 480 jin to 1,150 jin per mu.

Now, the 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition has begun to be launched. This movement is a component of the entire 1953 agricultural patriotic production increase competition. Party and government leading organs at all levels in the winter wheat producing areas across the country must seize the opportunity to vigorously organize responses and launch chain competitions locally, so as to lead workers and staff of mechanized farms and the broad masses of peasants to complete winter wheat sowing work in a timely manner and strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest next year.

    冬小麦增产竞赛揭开序幕
    九个国营机耕农场联名带头提出挑战
    【新华社十日讯】一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动，已经在九个国营机耕农场、三个地方国营农场、一个农业生产合作社和十二个互助组分别联名发起挑战之下，揭开了序幕。
  中央人民政府农业部“关于开展一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛的意见”中，曾指出小麦是我国的主要商品粮食之一，增产小麦对加强国家经济建设和国防事业、改善人民生活有极大的重要性。因此，在全国冬小麦产区，有组织有计划地普遍开展一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动，是发挥各国营农场工人、职员和广大农民的爱国主义劳动热情，贯彻小麦增产的有效方法。
    一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动的发起者中，首先是九个国营机耕农场：芦台农场，五里店农场，中央人民政府农业部直属机耕学校双桥实习农场，东辛农场，冀衡农场，黄泛区农场，灵武农场，扶风农场，永年农场。其中双桥实习农场一九五二年二百五十九亩冬小麦，平均每亩产一百八十二点三斤，超过原计划百分之二十一点五。黄泛区农场一九五二年四万五千多亩冬小麦，平均每亩产一百五十八点四八斤，最高每亩产三百六十一斤。这些国营农场虽然建立还不久，但都拥有大面积耕地，并使用了机器生产，在发挥生产潜力，提高单位面积产量方面，有着广阔的发展前途。这九个国营农场计划一九五三年冬小麦单位面积产量普遍比一九五二年增产百分之五十，并创造高额丰产新纪录。其次，发起者中有三个地方国营农场：山东省莱芜县农场，安徽省方邱湖农场，苏南区农业试验场。这些地方国营农场现在使用新式农具，运用农业科学技术经验，积极地贯彻着提高单位面积产量的方针。莱芜县农场一九五二年一百一十亩冬小麦，平均每亩产三百零三点五斤，并且创造了最高每亩产九百一十五斤的丰产纪录。该场计划一九五三年九十多亩冬小麦平均每亩达到四百五十斤，比当地农民一般产量高出百分之五十以上，另十亩丰产地创造平均每亩一千斤的丰产纪录。安徽省方邱湖农场计划播种冬小麦九千亩，每亩平均产量二百四十斤，比一九五二年增产三成，比当地农民一般产量高出五成，并在九千亩中划出四十亩，创造高额丰产纪录。苏南区农业试验场一九五三年冬小麦计划平均每亩产五百斤。另一批发起者是：山西省武乡县枣烟村魏名标农业生产合作社，平原省武陟县东石寺村李恩同互助组，平原省武陟县西白水村郭建文互助组，山西省赵城县下纪落村张无忧互助组，河南省项城县秦营乡朱显中互助组，苏北区睢宁县吴宅村崔玉霞互助组，山东省荣城县桥上村张本周互助组，山东省文登县苏家泊村王初华互助组，陕西省兴平县窦马村赵近礼互助组，许敬章互助组、张俊先互助组，河南省临颍县樱桃郭乡郭百合互助组，苏南区南汇县范路村金炎根互助组。这些农业生产合作社和互助组由于发挥了组织起来集体生产的优越性，逐步地提高了单位面积产量。一九五二年冬小麦的产量，平原省武陟县西白水村郭建文互助组平均每亩达四百五十五点八五斤，丰产地每亩七百九十九斤；同县东石寺村李恩同互助组平均每亩四百一十三点三斤；河南省项城县秦营乡朱显中互助组平均每亩四百二十九斤，丰产地每亩六百九十三斤；其他各个组、社平均产量在二百八十多斤到四百斤之间，并且同样也创造了一些丰产纪录。他们根据不同情况，计划一九五三年冬小麦平均增产一成到七成，并创造每亩四百八十斤到一千一百五十斤的高额丰产纪录。
    现在，一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动已经开始发动起来，这个运动是一九五三年度整个农业爱国增产竞赛运动的一个组成部分，全国冬小麦产区的党、政各级领导机关必须抓紧大力组织应战，并在当地发动连环竞赛，以便领导机耕农场工人、职员和广大农民适时完成冬小麦播种工作，争取明年全面丰收。
