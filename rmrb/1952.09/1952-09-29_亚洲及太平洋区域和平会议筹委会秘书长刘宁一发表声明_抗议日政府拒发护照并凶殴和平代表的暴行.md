Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Liu Ningyi, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, has issued a statement, strongly protesting the Japanese government's despicable act of refusing to issue passports to Japanese representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and instructing fascist thugs to brutally beat Japanese peace representatives. The statement firmly supports the Japanese people's just struggle to obtain passports for their peace representatives. The statement reads as follows:

    Just as the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, enthusiastically supported by 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific, is about to open, the Japanese government has brazenly refused to issue passports to Japanese representatives attending this peace conference. Furthermore, it instructed fascist thugs to openly storm into the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, in broad daylight, brutally beat these peace representatives, resulting in one representative seriously injured and ten others slightly injured (including two women). This shocking atrocity has not only aroused the anger and protest of the Japanese people but has also aroused the anger and opposition of the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.

    The whole world knows that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is to discuss important issues related to the peace, security, national independence, economic exchange, and cultural exchange of the people in the Asian and Pacific regions. The noble purpose of the conference fully conforms to the wishes and demands of the peace-loving people in Asia, the Pacific, and the whole world, and even more so to the wishes and demands of the Japanese people. Therefore, this peace conference has received the enthusiastic support and endorsement of hundreds of millions of people. The Japanese government's refusal to issue passports to Japanese peace representatives and its violent assault on them is clearly aimed at undermining the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and obstructing the conference from discussing issues of peace and security concerning the common demands of 1.6 billion people in the region, including the opposition to Japan's re-militarization and the promotion of Japan's development towards independence, peace, and democracy. This further proves that the Japanese government is disregarding the peaceful aspirations of the Japanese people and the people of various countries in Asia and the Pacific. It is a government that hates peace and is militaristic.

    It must be pointed out that the above-mentioned atrocities of the Japanese government are inseparable from the policies of the American government, which is still ruling Japan. The Japanese government is willingly following the American government's war preparation policy, continuing to place Japan under American military occupation, and, with the assistance of the United States, is stepping up the revival of militaristic forces, attempting to repeat its aggression against Asian and Pacific countries. Under the rule of the Japanese government, Japan has become a base for the American government to wage the Korean War, conduct bacteriological warfare against the Korean people, and carry out indiscriminate bombing. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida recently openly declared that the Japanese government would "lead Asia" with the support of the United States. All of this shows that the American and Japanese governments are colluding with each other, pursuing a policy of provoking war and undermining peace, which is increasingly increasing the threat to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions.

    Any actions of the Japanese government that adhere to a war policy and are hostile to peace cannot be ignored by the peace-loving people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. On behalf of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, I lodge a serious protest with the Japanese government against its atrocities of refusing to issue passports to Japanese peace representatives and violently assaulting them. I express deep sympathy and support for the Japanese people's just struggle to obtain passports for their peace representatives and for the demands made by the injured Japanese peace representatives that the Japanese government should apologize to them, compensate them for their losses, and severely punish the perpetrators.

    Finally, I would also like to point out that the struggle of the Japanese people of all strata for peace, democracy, and independence is unanimously supported by hundreds of millions of good people in the Asian and Pacific regions. This solidarity and mutual assistance, generated under the common goal of striving for peace, can never be isolated or severed by any anti-peace forces. The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions will continue to cooperate closely with the Japanese people, hand in hand, to fight to the end for peace and to fight to the end against Japan's re-militarization. The Japanese government's perverse actions will inevitably lead to its own destruction.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹委会秘书长刘宁一发表声明
    抗议日政府拒发护照并凶殴和平代表的暴行
    【新华社二十八日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会秘书长刘宁一顷发表声明，严重抗议日本政府拒绝发出国护照给参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表，指使法西斯暴徒凶殴日本和平代表的卑鄙行为，并坚决支持日本人民为和平代表争取护照的正义斗争。声明如下：
    正当亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民热烈拥护的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议行将开幕的时候，日本政府竟蛮横地拒绝发出国护照给参加这个和平会议的日本代表，并且指使法西斯暴徒公然冲进日本政府的外务省，在光天化日之下凶殴这些和平代表，致使和平代表一人受重伤，十人受轻伤（其中妇女两人）。这种惊人的暴行，不但激起了日本人民的愤怒和抗议，也激起了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的愤怒和反对。
    全世界都知道：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议所要讨论的，是有关亚洲及太平洋区域人民的和平安全、民族独立、经济交流和文化交流等重要问题。会议的这种崇高目的完全符合亚洲、太平洋以及全世界爱好和平的人民的意愿和要求，更完全符合日本人民的意愿和要求。因此，这个和平会议得到了亿万人民的热烈支持和拥护。日本政府对于日本人民的和平代表拒发护照并横加殴打，其目的显然是要破坏亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，阻挠这次会议讨论保卫本区域十六亿人民共同要求的和平与安全问题，其中包括反对日本重新军国主义化并促使日本向独立、和平、民主发展的问题。这就更加证明了日本政府是蔑视日本人民和亚洲及太平洋各国人民的和平愿望的，是仇视和平的、军国主义的政府。
    必须指出：日本政府的上述暴行是和还在继续统治着日本的美国政府的政策分不开的。日本政府正在心甘情愿地追随美国政府的备战政策，把日本继续置于美国的军事占领之下，并在美国的扶助之下加紧复活军国主义势力，企图重演对亚洲和太平洋各国的侵略。在日本政府的统治之下，日本已成为美国政府进行朝鲜战争，对朝鲜人民进行细菌战并实行狂轰滥炸的基地。日本政府首相吉田最近更公然宣称日本政府要在美国扶植之下“领导亚洲”，这一切说明：美国政府和日本政府相互勾结，进行挑拨战争破坏和平的政策，正日益增加着对亚洲及太平洋区域和平的威胁。
    日本政府坚持战争政策、敌视和平的任何行径，都是亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平人民所不能熟视无睹的。我代表亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会对日本政府拒绝发给日本和平代表出国护照并对他们逞凶殴打的暴行，向日本政府提出严重的抗议，对于日本人民为和平代表争取护照的正义斗争，对于受害的日本和平代表所提出的日本政府应对他们道歉，赔偿损失并严惩凶手的要求，则表示深切的同情和支持。
    最后，我还要指出，日本各阶层人民争取和平、民主、独立的斗争是受到亚洲及太平洋区域亿万善良人民的一致支持的。这种在争取和平这个同一的目标下所产生的团结互助，绝对不是任何反和平的势力所能隔离和切断的。亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民将继续与日本人民手携手地亲密合作，为争取和平奋斗到底，为反对日本重新军国主义化奋斗到底。日本政府的倒行逆施，必将自食其果。
