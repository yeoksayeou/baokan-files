    It is Imperative to Earnestly Educate and Examine Activists in Party Building Work
    Xin Yi
    Educating and examining non-Party activists is an extremely important political task for the Party organization and a crucial link in Party building work. Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed us: "The work of admitting Party members should not be regarded as a simple organizational or technical task, but must be seen as the result of long-term and effective ideological education and examination of activists among the working people." This shows the importance of regular education and examination of activists in Party building work.
    In the past, we lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of this work and did not have a system for educating and examining activists, which greatly affected the development of the Party. Although various units have paid attention to the selection of activists, the degree of importance attached to this work and the specific methods adopted are still different, and there are still problems in some places, especially in specific methods. For example, some only put forward the number of activists to be cultivated, but not the specific objects of cultivation; some use the standards of Party members to measure activists, and the number of activists selected does not exceed the number of Party members developed, but equates the two; some have not yet regarded the selection and education of activists as an important part of Party building work, but are simply busy with the organizational work of admitting new Party members. These are shortcomings that should be corrected.
    How should Party organizations correctly select activists and specifically educate and examine them?
    To correctly select activists, it is necessary to strictly grasp the conditions for activists. These conditions are: 1. Good class background and basically clear history; 2. Responding to the Party's call, actively performing in production, work, and various movements, and able to play a leading role; 3. Approaching the Party, willing to learn, and aspiring to progress. When we select activists according to the above conditions, we must neither set the conditions too high, demanding non-Party activists according to the eight conditions of Party members, nor lower the level of activists to the level of the general public. When selecting activists, Party organizations at all levels should submit a list from bottom to top through the Party小组 (small groups), which shall be reviewed and approved by the branch committee and reported to the higher-level Party committee for the record. As for units that have not established Party organizations, they can be recommended by the organizations of the Communist Youth League and the trade unions. The number of activists selected should generally exceed one-half or one times the number of Party members developed. In this way, after educating the vast number of activists about communism and the Communist Party, people who meet the standards of Party members can be absorbed into the Party. Therefore, earnestly selecting and cultivating activists can create favorable conditions for Party building work. Although some people do not currently meet the conditions for joining the Party, they may meet the conditions for joining the Party after three months, half a year, or a year of education and cultivation. If they do not currently meet the conditions and do not actively educate and cultivate them, but adopt a passive waiting attitude, or even base the selection of activists on the standards of Party members, this is all wrong.
    Regarding how Party organizations should conduct specific education and examination of activists, this must be determined according to the specific circumstances of each unit. If the branch of this unit has a large number of Party members and the quality is relatively high, and the specific task of developing the Party is relatively small, then the activists can be incorporated into the Party 小组(small groups), let them attend Party classes with Party members, and Party members can be designated to conduct specific education and examination of certain activists. If this unit only has a few Party members, or even no Party members, then the activists should be organized, attend classes with Party members or hold separate training courses for activists, and the branch should send good Party members to specifically guide everyone in their studies. When leading them to study the eight conditions of Party members, they should emphasize linking with reality, boldly exposing thoughts, and enlightening them, criticizing each other, and examining each other's history. In this way, the Party branch can understand their thoughts and historical situation through the study group. However, when specifically conducting Party consolidation education and educating activists, it is necessary to clearly define the purpose and distinguish the primary and secondary aspects of the two. If the Party consolidation is the main focus, and non-Party activists are absorbed to participate, then the focus is on examining Party members, solving ideological and style problems within the Party, and the focus is on Party members rather than activists. If the purpose is to educate and examine activists, and the Party organization sends Party members to play a backbone and leading role among the activists, then the focus should be on activists. Some agencies confuse the two, and organize Party members and activists together for discussion in Party consolidation studies, resulting in Party members speaking more, which affects the exposure of thoughts by activists. Later, in order to allow more activists to speak, it affected the ideological review of Party members. In this way, taking care of one thing and losing sight of the other, of course, cannot achieve the desired results.
    In addition to using the method of grouping studies to educate and examine activists, the Party organization can also assign specific work to activists through the organizations of the Communist Youth League and the trade unions in central work or central movements, so as to examine their actual level of awareness based on their specific performance, examine whether they can respond to the Party's call, obey the Party's leadership, and complete the tasks assigned to them by the Party, especially paying attention to whether they can abandon personal interests and obey the Party's interests when their personal interests conflict with the Party's interests. In addition, in places where the Party's strength is weak, it can also help and examine general activists through the backbone of the activists, and drive the general public through the activists, promote various work, and gradually cultivate the work style of activists to closely connect with the masses.
    In order to solemnly and cautiously admit new Party members and educate activists, the Party organization must openly educate those who apply to join the Party, so that they can truthfully explain their historical situation and political experience to the Party. Before the Party admits them to the Party, it must examine their history and political situation clearly, otherwise, they cannot be admitted to the Party.
    In order to effectively educate and examine activists, a regular management system should be established, which is to register the activists who have been selected. At the end of each political movement or each central task, the Party branch is responsible for supervising the Party members who are in contact with the activists, and filling in the main performance of the activists and the results of their examination in detail and separately once. In this way, on the one hand, it is convenient for the higher-level Party committee to systematically understand the specific situation of the activists, so as to conduct education and assistance in a timely manner according to the opinions of the examination; on the other hand, when the activists are transferred, it is also convenient for the new work department to understand them. This registration management system is very necessary in practical work. Therefore, the Party committee and the Party branch must have a dedicated person responsible for mastering this work.

    在建党工作中必须认真教育和考察积极分子
    辛毅
    教育和考察非党积极分子，是党的组织极其重要的政治任务，是建党工作中的一个重要环节。刘少奇同志指示我们说：“不应该把接收党员的工作看作是一种单纯的组织工作或技术工作，而必须把它看成是对劳动人民中的积极分子进行长期而有效的思想教育工作和考察工作的结果。”由此可见，对积极分子进行经常的教育和考察在建党工作中居于何等重要的地位。
    过去我们对于这一工作的重要意义缺乏足够的认识，没有教育和考察积极分子的制度，大大影响了党的发展。目前各单位虽然注意了对积极分子的选拔，但是对这一工作的重视程度和具体做法还各不相同，特别在具体作法上，有些地方还存在着问题。例如，有的只提出了培养积极分子的数字，却没有培养积极分子的具体对象；有的用党员标准去衡量积极分子，选拔积极分子的数字没有超过发展党员的数字，而是把两者等同起来了；有的还没有把选拔教育积极分子当作建党工作的重要一环来作，而单纯地忙于办理接收新党员的组织工作。这都是应当注意纠正的缺点。
    党的组织应该怎样正确地选拔积极分子、怎样具体地教育和考察积极分子呢？
    要正确地选拔积极分子，必须严格掌握积极分子的条件。这些条件是：一、成分好、历史基本清楚；二、响应党的号召，在生产、工作及各种运动中表现积极，并能起带头作用；三、向党靠拢，愿意学习，要求进步。我们在根据以上条件选拔积极分子时，既不能把条件提得过高，拿党员标准的八项条件来要求非党积极分子，也不能把积极分子的水平降低到一般群众的水平。各个党的组织在选拔积极分子时，应通过党的小组自下而上地提出名单，经支部委员会审查批准，报上级党委备案。至于没有建立党组织的单位，可由青年团和工会的组织推荐。选拔积极分子的数字，一般应超过发展党员的数字的二分之一或一倍以上。这样，才能经过对广大积极分子关于共产主义和共产党的教育，从中吸收具备党员标准的人入党。因此，认真地选拔和培养积极分子，就能够为建党工作创造有利条件。有些人虽然目前不够入党条件，但经过三个月、半年或一年的教育和培养之后，他们就有可能具备入党条件。如果他们目前不够条件，又不积极去教育、培养他们，而采取消极等待态度，甚至在选拔积极分子时所根据的是党员标准，这都是不对的。
    关于党的组织应该如何对积极分子进行具体的教育和考察，这须按各单位的具体情况而定。如果这个单位支部的党员数量多而且质量也较高，发展党的具体任务也较小，那就可以把积极分子编入党的小组，让他们和党员一起上党课，并可指定党员对某些积极分子进行具体教育和考察。如果这个单位仅有几个党员，甚至没有党员，那就应该把积极分子组织起来，随党员一起上课或单独举办积极分子训练班，由支部派好的党员具体指导大家进行学习。在领导他们学习党员标准的八项条件时，应强调联系实际，大胆暴露思想；并启发他们，互相批判，互相考察历史。这样，党的支部可以通过学习小组了解他们的思想和历史情况。不过在具体进行整党教育和对积极分子进行教育时，必须明确地确定目的，分清两者的主次。如果以整党为主，吸收非党积极分子参加，那末中心是审查党员，解决党内的思想和作风问题，重点是党员而不是积极分子。如果为了教育和考察积极分子，党组织派党员到积极分子中起骨干和领导作用，那末，应以积极分子为主。有的机关把两者混淆起来，在整党学习中把党员和积极分子编在一起进行讨论，结果党员发言多，影响了积极分子暴露思想。后来为了多让积极分子发言，又影响了党员的思想检查。这样，顾此失彼，当然不能收到应有的效果。
    党组织除了运用编组学习的方式对积极分子进行教育和考察以外，还可在中心工作或中心运动中通过青年团和工会的组织分配积极分子以具体工作，借以根据他们的具体表现来考察他们的实际觉悟程度，考察他们能否响应党的号召，服从党的领导，完成党交给他们的任务，尤其注意当他们的个人利益和党的利益发生抵触时，能否放弃个人利益服从党的利益。此外，在党的力量较弱的地方，还可通过积极分子中的骨干去帮助和考察一般的积极分子，并通过积极分子带动一般群众，推动各种工作，逐渐使积极分子养成密切联系群众的工作作风。
    为了严肃慎重地接收新党员，并教育积极分子，党组织必须公开教育申请入党的人，让他们忠诚地向党交代他们的历史情况和政治经历。党在接收他们入党之前，必须对他们的历史和政治情况考察清楚，否则，不能接收其入党。
    为了对积极分子进行有效的教育和考察，应该建立经常性的管理制度，这就是登记已经选拔的积极分子。在每个政治运动或每一项中心工作告一段落时，由党的支部负责督促和积极分子联系的党员，将积极分子的主要表现和对他们考察的结果，具体分别填写一次。这样，一方面便于上级党委系统地了解积极分子的具体情况，从而根据考察的意见及时进行教育和帮助；另一方面，在积极分子调动工作时，也可便于新的工作部门对他们的了解。这种登记管理制度，在实际工作中是十分需要的。因此党委和党的支部必须有专人负责来掌握这一工作。
