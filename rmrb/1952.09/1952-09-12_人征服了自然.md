    Man Conquers Nature
    Yan Ling

    Can we complete the production increase plan if it doesn't rain? How can collectivization and mechanization be implemented in mountainous areas? The Chinese Farmers Delegation discovered a truth in the Soviet Union: no difficulty can defeat people, and there are ways to achieve a bumper harvest everywhere. The Party's strong leadership and enormous organizational power, advanced science and technology, and selfless labor enthusiasm have made the Soviet people giants who can turn the universe around. The Soviet people are transforming and conquering nature on the world's largest scale.

    Wind and Water Must Obey Man
    "In the past, I heard that Soviet science was very advanced, but I thought: no matter how scientific you are, you still can't eat if you don't work in the fields," said Zhao Huaiyi, a model agricultural worker from Henan Province. "After visiting the Soviet Union this time, I truly admire science. In Azerbaijan, it doesn't rain for four months every year – May, June, July, and August. In the Tsarist era, crops couldn't grow at all, but now there is a bumper harvest every year. Irrigation projects are being built everywhere, and some projects can irrigate tens of millions of hectares of land. Where there is no water, water is brought in from hundreds of miles away. Wind and water are still two major hazards in our area; in the Soviet Union, wind and water obey man and serve the people. It's truly man overcoming nature! The Soviet Union uses wind power to generate electricity, windmills to pump water; there are hydroelectric power stations everywhere. There are machines for digging ditches everywhere. It only takes the time to smoke two cigarettes for it to dig a ditch three feet deep, five feet wide, and three miles long. The excavated soil is distributed on both sides, and soil compactors follow closely to compress it into two small earthen embankments. Last year, we dug a drainage ditch at home, a foot deep, three feet wide, and a little over a mile long, which cost six or seven hundred workers. You can see how powerful science is! This has driven away my thinking of relying on heaven for food."

    Mo Ri Ge Ce, a model agricultural worker from Inner Mongolia, said: "Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union is also a dry place. We were there for two months, and not a drop of rain fell. Wild grass was withered by the drought, but the crops grew very well. Their irrigation is well-developed, and even the pastures are irrigated. In many places we visited, they are planning to expand the irrigated area. I have never dreamed of such a large-scale plan as theirs. We can also irrigate in my hometown, but there is not enough water, and the irrigation method is not good. The Soviet Union irrigates shallowly every few days when needed. We don't irrigate usually, and only irrigate when the crops have grown up, and we irrigate on hot days, which kills the crops. Without scientific guidance, it really won't work." He went on to say: "Soviet friends told us that their agriculture has four major guarantees: first, they are not afraid of drought (with water conservancy irrigation and various soil moisture conservation methods), second, they are not afraid of insects (aircraft can spray insecticides on twenty hectares in one hour), third, they are not afraid of infertile land (with sufficient fertilizer and rational crop rotation systems), and fourth, they are not afraid of too much land (with sufficient machines for cultivation, no matter how much land there is, it can be taken care of). We have seen many places, and it is true. Most of the soil in Kazakhstan has been improved, and sandy land has become fertile land. Kazakhstan has two large chemical fertilizer plants, and the fertilizers produced can supply the whole Soviet Union."

    Artificial Rainfall, Shelterbelts, and Grass-Arable Rotation
    Artificial rainfall is a new thing. Some people think: maybe airplanes are used to carry water from the river and sprinkle it in the sky? This time, when our farmers' delegation visited the Soviet Union, they also clarified this matter. Zhao Huaiyi, Zhao Zhongyi (model agricultural worker from Henan Province), Rao Xingli (farmers' representative from Hubei Province), Li Neng (model agricultural worker from Yunnan Province), etc. saw artificial rainfall in the Zhenli Collective Farm in the Lenkoran District of Azerbaijan and other places. The artificial rainmaking device is a water pipe rack more than a foot above the ground. There is a special device at the water outlet of the water pipe, which can turn the water into fine rain and spray it high up to sprinkle down. The pipes are in sections, which can be long or short. Usually four people can lift and move them. One rack can spray more than five mu of land at a time, and the "rain" can have a soil moisture content of five or six inches deep. The water comes from underground water pipes. A faucet is connected to the water pipe every few mu of land, and when the faucet is connected to the water pipe on the rainmaking device, it automatically starts to "rain". What are the advantages of doing this compared with watering from the ground? First, it uses less water; second, the water is cooler and suitable for the needs of crops; third, it can moisten the leaves, allowing the leaves to directly absorb some moisture; fourth, the soil watered in this way is relatively loose, and the ground is not easy to form a thick hard shell. The farmers' representatives exclaimed: "They have researched it so thoroughly."

    The farmers' representatives all talked about the Soviet Union's shelterbelts. They saw that rows of trees were planted around every hundred hectares of land. The area of the Michurin Collective Farm is 12,790 hectares, and the shelterbelts occupy 1,106 hectares. Li Shunda said: "Some of the shelterbelts are already one or two zhang high, and the wind can no longer knock down the crops." Mo Ri Ge Ce said: "Soviet friends told us that many sandy lands originally had no trees; now they are a green expanse. The trees not only block the wind and prevent the crops from falling, but also protect the sandy soil from being blown away, and can also change the climate and retain moisture. We must plant more trees and build shelterbelts when we go back."

    The farmers' representatives were particularly interested in the Soviet Union's grass-arable rotation. Some people originally thought: "My land is not enough to grow food, how dare I plant grass?" After the guidance of Soviet friends, they realized that grass-arable rotation not only does not reduce food production when all is said and done, but also grows more grass to feed livestock, which can develop animal husbandry; and it uses less fertilizer and less labor than growing food crops every year. Some farmers' representatives said: "At first, we always thought that the Soviet Union has a wide land area, few people and a lot of land, so it implements grass-arable rotation. After they carefully analyzed it, we realized that we were wrong. It turns out that this is a high-yield method that the Soviet Union has researched for many years. Of course, it is convenient to rotate with more land, but it is also possible to rotate with less land, at least agricultural production cooperatives can adopt the rotation method."

    Even with Bad Land, Cotton Can Still Have a Bumper Harvest
    Speaking of rotation to ensure high yields, Zhao Huaiyi said: "I am most impressed by the cotton in the Hongshiyue Collective Farm in the Saqonra District of the Azerbaijan Republic. The cotton land of this farm rotates every six years: three years of growing pasture, two years of growing cotton, and one year of intercropping spring wheat and pasture (when wheat is harvested, the pasture has not yet grown up, so it can still be harvested by machine). Their cultivation is deep first and then shallow, which can retain moisture and prevent seedling death; we do the opposite, shallow first and then deep, which causes the moisture to run off. Their farm plants 110,000 cotton plants per hectare (equivalent to 7,333 plants per mu); we only plant 800 or 900 plants per mu. Last year, they harvested 5,000 kilograms of seed cotton per hectare (equivalent to more than 660 jin per mu), and some individuals harvested more than 7,000 kilograms per hectare. We only harvest an average of 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. We must learn from the Soviet Union in the future."

    Rao Xingli said: "The yield of Soviet cotton is indeed high. Most areas of Azerbaijan could not grow cotton at all in the Tsarist era; one farm we visited was able to harvest 600 kilograms of cotton per hectare in 1929; 1,000 kilograms in 1935; 2,800 to 3,000 kilograms in 1940; and in 1945, although production was mainly carried out by women during the Patriotic War, the yield still increased, reaching 4,000 kilograms per hectare, and some individuals reached 4,500 kilograms." Mo Ri Ge Ce said: "In the Lenin Collective Farm in the Dzhambul Oblast of the Kazakh Republic, we met an old man named Sonidata, who was awarded the Order of Lenin. Last year, he harvested an average of 70 quintals (one quintal equals 100 kilograms, 200 jin) of seed cotton per hectare. He said: 'I have written a letter to Stalin to guarantee that I am 72 years old this year, and I will harvest at least 72 quintals of cotton per hectare.' We saw him happily singing and dancing. He said: 'I am an old youth, and I don't agree with anyone who says I am old. I still want to strive to be a socialist labor hero, and I also hope to go to China to help Chinese farmers increase cotton production.' I am only 45 years old this year, but I always feel that I am old and have no future. Seeing that old man, I feel that my thinking is too wrong. In the future, I must resolutely struggle, struggle for collectivization, and struggle to create high yields!"

    The Idea of "Increasing Production to the Top" is Driven Away
    Speaking of the high yield of Soviet crops, our farmers' representatives are most concerned. The natural conditions of Soviet agriculture are generally not as good as those of our country. However, the yields of Soviet crops are generally higher than those of our country. Yang Xianting, a model agricultural worker from Heilongjiang Province, said: "The soil quality in Ukraine is the same as that in our Northeast, but their wheat yield is much higher than ours. One collective farm we visited harvested only 7 to 8 quintals of wheat per hectare before mechanization, but now it can harvest 22 to 35 quintals, and the highest can harvest 45 quintals. Our Northeast has not yet harvested an average of 10 quintals per hectare this year. The highest in my hometown (Keshan County) area is only 15 to 17 quintals. It can be seen that our yield can still be greatly improved." Rao Xingli said: "We went to a seed experimental station in the Rebinski District of the Krasnodar Territory, and their wheat harvested an average of 48 quintals per hectare, and the most harvested more than 50 quintals per hectare. The farmers in my hometown have a heavy conservative mindset, and many people say: the land is not made of rubber, and it cannot be widened or lengthened, how can the yield be increased again? Looking at the Soviet Union, we know that our yield has not reached the top, and we don't know how far away from the 'top' it is!" Li Shunda said: "There is a corn high-yield labor hero in the Kirovohrad Oblast of Ukraine who planted five hectares of corn last year and harvested 208.6 quintals per hectare, creating the world's highest record. This year, he plans to harvest 226 quintals per hectare. The same piece of land could only harvest 5 or 6 quintals per hectare in the Tsarist era. The grain yield of the October Revolution Victory Collective Farm is also increasing year by year, and it has recovered quickly after the war. In 1946, the average winter wheat harvest was 8 quintals per hectare, and in 1950 it harvested 33 quintals per hectare; rye harvested 5 quintals per hectare in 1946, and increased to 23.2 quintals in 1950. It is still constantly improving." Mo Ri Ge Ce said: "Kazakhstan used to be a dry and barren place, and few crops grew. Now, with water conservancy irrigation, the wheat harvest in some places has reached 40 quintals per hectare; the Dimitrov Collective Farm in the Taldy-Kurgan Oblast harvested an average of 26 quintals of wheat per hectare last year, and the highest reached 38 quintals."

    Soviet agricultural scientists and farmers can not only control plants, turning low-yield wheat varieties into high-yield varieties, making cotton bloom in a concentrated period of time, and making apples from warm places grow in cold places; they can also control animals, turning coarse-wool sheep into fine-wool sheep, turning foxes into domestic animals, wanting dairy cows to produce more milk, and wanting sheep to give birth to more lambs. Zhang Xuexiu, a model agricultural worker from Pingyuan Province, said: "People used to say that Soviet pigs could grow to 600 or 700 jin, and I didn't believe it; I saw it in the movie, but I still didn't quite believe it. This time, I visited a farm in the Soviet Union, and they deliberately drove a pig out for us to see, and it was really scary; it weighed 398 kilograms, which is equivalent to 796 jin in China!" Yang Xianting said: "The Soviet Union still uses horse-drawn rocker reapers to harvest wheat on small plots of land. We use the same reapers, and we need four horses to pull them; they have improved the horse breed, and only two horses are needed." They also said that the Soviet Union is not only turning coarse-wool sheep into fine-wool sheep, but also making the wool and meat of these sheep twice as much as before the improvement. In the past, each dairy cow only produced 500 to 600 liters a year, but now it can produce 3,000 to 4,000 liters a year.

    Mountainous Areas Can Also Be Collectivized and Mechanized
    Can mountainous areas be collectivized and mechanized? Absolutely. Lü Hongbin, a model agricultural worker from Shandong Province, said: "We visited Georgia, where most of the land is mountainous. In the mountains, where there is no flat land at all, it is not only collectivized, but also electrified. Large roads where cars can run can reach the top of the mountain. There are also electric lights and radios on the mountain, and the work of mills, blacksmiths, and carpenters is also done with electricity. We visited the Arshania Collective Farm in the Makharadze District ‘Shurouma’ (meaning ‘labor’) Village. This farm mainly grows tea trees, orange trees, lemon trees, raises bees and cattle. This mountain village used to be very poor! They said: 'It used to be very difficult for men in our village to find good wives, because life here is too difficult. Now, very beautiful girls are also willing to come to our collective farm.' In the Tsarist era, many farmers in this village participated in uprisings and fought against landlords; many people were exiled to Siberia, and some even met Stalin, who was exiled at the time. After the victory of the revolution, they all returned. An old man said: 'We can still drive around in the mountains now, and we really have to thank Stalin!' They also built a club on the mountain that can accommodate 800 spectators. In 1951, they earned 32 rubles in cash, 5 kilograms of wheat, and some corn for each work day (some of their grain was exchanged with the state for tea). The Molotov Collective Farm is also in the mountains, and each work day can distribute 39 rubles in cash and 4.5 kilograms of grain; an average of 260 work days per year for each laborer. Generally, mountain areas have higher incomes than plains. On the plains of the Stavropol Territory in the Russian Republic, the average farm can distribute about 4 to 9 rubles in cash and 3 to 5 kilograms of grain per work day. It can be seen that mountainous areas are by no means without a future." Li Neng also said: "We visited the Shusha District of Azerbaijan, which is more than 1,000 meters high; the wheat at the foot of the mountain has been harvested for a long time, but the wheat on the mountain is still green. There are many stones on the mountain, but there is also a lot of grass. The collective farm there mainly develops animal husbandry. Horse-drawn mowers can go up the mountain. Land with a slope of less than 45 degrees can be cultivated by machines. The five-share plow used in mountainous areas can turn over, and the soil is turned to one side back and forth. There is also tap water on the mountain, which is pumped up from the foot of the mountain by machines. The stones and wood on the mountain are cheap, and the houses are built more beautifully than on the plain. The mountain roads are also asphalt roads. My hometown (Yuxi Prefecture, Yunnan Province) is also a mountainous area. Now we only grow some rice and broad beans, and the yield is very low; in the future, we must develop animal husbandry and forestry like the Soviet Union. We can raise more sheep and buffalo if we plant pasture there; chestnuts grow very large, and planting more can greatly increase income, and other fruit trees can also be planted. As long as we work hard, we will have a great future when we establish collective farms in the future."
              ×　　　　　×　　　　×
    Why can we control nature? In addition to collectivization and mechanization, the most important thing is to pay attention to science and technology. Shi Rulin, a farmer representative from Inner Mongolia, said: "Soviet agriculture is agriculture under the guidance of the most advanced science. Rotation, breeding, irrigation, fertilization, etc. are all carried out according to the most advanced scientific theories. They have completely overthrown the reactionary agricultural theories of the bourgeoisie. They pointed out according to scientific experiments: productivity can be infinitely developed; it is pure bourgeois nonsense that the more land is planted, the less grain is produced." Lü Hongbin said: "Soviet agriculture has scientific theories guiding what to do in each season, ensuring that there will be no mistakes. The production plan is so meticulously formulated that it is impossible to do it without science." Li Shunda said: "Each collective farm is not only inseparable from the tractor station, but also inseparable from the breeding station, the seed experimental station, and the state-owned farm. A large number of technical cadres and good seeds, good seedlings, good dairy cows, etc. are all trained and supplied by the state-owned farm. Almost every farm has its own technical cadres and experts. The state has transformed farmers into people with scientific knowledge."

    人征服了自然
    燕凌
    天不下雨能够完成增产计划吗？山地怎样实行集体化、机械化呢？中国农民代表参观团在苏联发现了一条真理：什么困难也难不倒人，什么地方也有办法取得丰收。党的坚强领导和巨大的组织力量，先进的科学技术和忘我的劳动热情，使苏联人民成为旋转乾坤的巨人。苏联人民正用全世界最大的规模在改造自然，征服自然。
    风和水都得听人的话
    “过去听说苏联科学很发达，我就想：随你怎样科学，不在地里做活，还是吃不了饭。”河南省农业劳动模范赵怀义说：“这次去苏联参观，我算真信服科学了。阿塞拜疆每年五、六、七、八四个月不下雨，沙皇时代根本不长庄稼，现在是年年丰收、样样丰收。到处都在修建水利工程，有的一个工程能浇成千万公顷的土地。没有水的地方，把水从几百里以外的地方引了过来。风和水在我们那里还是两大害；在苏联，风和水都听人的话，为人民服务了。真是人胜了天！苏联用风力发电，风车吸水；水力发电站更是那里都有。各处都有挖渠的机器。它挖三尺深五尺宽三里远的渠，只不过吸两支纸烟的工夫。挖出来的土分在两边，压土机紧跟着就压成两条小土堤。我们去年在家挖防水沟，尺把深、三尺宽、一里多长，就费了六七百个工。你看科学有多厉害！这一下把我的靠天吃饭思想赶跑了。”
    内蒙农业劳动模范莫日格策说：“苏联的卡查赫也是个干旱的地方。我们在那里两个月，一滴雨也没有下。野草都旱死了，庄稼可是长得很好。那里的灌溉事业很发达，牧草地也都浇了水。我们参观的很多地方，正在计划扩大灌溉面积。像人家那里的大计划，是我做梦也没梦见过的。我们家乡也能灌溉，可是水不够用，浇水的方法也不好。苏联是隔几天需要的时候就浅浅地浇上一次，我们那里是平时不浇，庄稼长大了才浇，而且是在大热天去浇，这样一浇庄稼就死了。没有科学指导真不行。”他接着又说：“苏联朋友告诉我们，他们的农业有四大保证：一不怕旱（有水利灌溉和各种保墒办法），二不怕虫（飞机撒杀虫药一点钟能撒二十公顷），三不怕地瘦（有足够的肥料和合理的轮作制度），四不怕地多（有足够的机器进行耕作，土地再多也能伺弄得过来）。我们看了很多地方，真是一点也不错。卡查赫大部分土壤都改良了，沙地变成了肥地。卡查赫有两个大化学肥料工厂，出产的肥料能供给全苏联各地使用。”
    人工降雨、防护林和草田轮作
    人工降雨，是件新鲜事情。有人想：大概是用飞机把河里的水载到天上洒下来吧？这次我国农民代表到苏联参观，也把这件事情弄清楚了。赵怀义、赵中义（河南省农业劳动模范），饶兴礼（湖北省农民代表），李能（云南省农业劳动模范）等在阿塞拜疆的林克兰区的真理集体农庄等地看到了人工降雨的情形。人工降雨器是离地一尺多高的水管架子，水管上出水的地方有一种特别的装置，能把水变成细雨一样喷到高处洒下来。管子是一节一节的，可长可短，一般的有四个人就可以抬起移动。一个架子大约十分钟移一次，一次能洒五亩多地，下的“雨”能有五六寸深的墒。水是从埋在地下的水管子里出来的。水管在每几亩地里接上一个水龙头，水龙头接上降雨器上的水管子，就自动下起“雨”来了。这样做比从地面上浇水的好处在那里呢？第一，费水少；第二，水比较凉，适合庄稼的需要；第三，可以湿润叶子，使叶子直接吸收一些水分；第四，这样浇的地是比较松的，地面不易结成很厚的硬壳。农民代表们赞叹着说：“人家研究得真是精到。”
    农民代表们都谈到了苏联的防护林带。他们看到，每一百公顷土地的四周都栽了一条一条的树林子。米丘林集体农庄的面积有一万二千七百九十公顷，防护林带就占了一千一百零六公顷。李顺达说：“防护林有的已经长了一两丈高，风已经刮不倒庄稼了。”莫日格策说：“苏联朋友告诉我们，很多沙地，原来没有一棵树；现在已经是一片绿色。树林不但能挡住风使庄稼不倒，还能保住沙土不让吹跑，又能改变气候，保持水分。我们回去一定也要多种树，造防护林。”
    农民代表们对于苏联的草田轮作特别感到兴趣。有些人原来想：“我那地里打粮食还不够吃哩，还敢种草？”经过苏联朋友的指点，才知道草田轮作不但总算起来不少打粮食，而且多长了喂牲畜的草，可以发展畜牧业；还比年年种粮食作物少用肥料，少费人工。有些农民代表说：“最初总认为苏联地面宽，人少地多，才实行草田轮作。经人家给仔细剖解，才知道自己想错了。原来这是苏联多年研究出来的丰产办法。地多，轮起来当然方便，地少也是可以轮种的，至少农业生产合作社是可以采用轮作办法的。”
    地不好，棉花也能丰收
    提起轮作能保证丰产，赵怀义说：“我对于阿塞拜疆共和国萨葱拉区红十月集体农庄的棉花印象最深。这个农庄的棉花地是六年一轮：三年长牧草，二年种棉花，一年春小麦和牧草间作（割麦时牧草还没有长起来，所以仍然可以用机器割）。他们耕地是先深后浅，能保墒，不死苗；我们恰好弄反了，先浅后深，把墒都翻跑了。他们这个农庄每公顷种十一万棵棉花（合每亩七千三百三十三棵）；我们那里一亩只种八、九百棵。去年他们每公顷收了五千公斤（合每亩六百六十多斤）籽棉，个别的每公顷收了七千多公斤。我们那里平均一亩才不过收一百五十斤籽棉。以后一定要好好向苏联学习。”
    饶兴礼说：“苏联棉花的产量确实高。阿塞拜疆大部地区在沙皇时代根本不能种棉花；我们参观的一个农场，一九二九年每公顷能收六百公斤棉花；一九三五年收到一千公斤；一九四○年收到二千八百到三千公斤；一九四五年，虽然在卫国战争中，主要是由妇女进行生产，产量仍然增加了，达到了每公顷四千公斤，个别的达到了四千五百公斤。”莫日格策说：“我们在卡查赫共和国詹布尔州列宁集体农庄见到一位得了列宁勋章的老汉，名叫索尼达那塔。他去年一公顷平均收了七十公担（一公担等于一百公斤，二百市斤）籽棉。他说：‘我已经写信向斯大林保证，我今年七十二岁了，至少每公顷要收七十二公担棉花。’我们看到他高兴地唱歌、跳舞。他说：‘我是老青年，谁要说我老，我可不同意。我还要争取做个社会主义劳动英雄，我还希望能到中国帮助中国农民提高棉花产量。’我今年才四十五岁，却老是觉得自己老了，没有什么前途了。看看人家老汉，我就觉得自己的想法太不对了。以后要坚决奋斗，为集体化奋斗，为创造高额产量奋斗！”
    把“增产到顶”思想赶跑了
    谈起苏联农作物的高额产量，我国农民代表最为关心。苏联农业的自然条件一般地说是不如我国的。但是，苏联的农作物一般的产量都比我国的高。黑龙江省农业劳动模范杨显亭说：“乌克兰的土质和我们东北一样，可是他们的小麦产量比我们的高得多。我们参观的一个集体农场，在机械化以前，一公顷小麦只收七公担到八公担，现在能收二十二公担到三十五公担，最高的能收四十五公担。我们东北今年小麦平均每公顷还没有收到十公担。我们家乡（克山县）一带最高的也才收十五到十七公担。可见我们的产量还是能大大提高的。”饶兴礼说：“我们去克拉斯那达尔边境区列宾斯克区一个种籽试验站参观，他们的小麦平均每公顷收了四十八公担，最多的一公顷收了五十多公担。我们家乡农民的保守思想很重，很多人说：地又不是橡皮的，没法拉宽拉长，产量怎么能再增加？看看苏联，就知道我们的产量不是增到顶了，离‘顶’还不知道有多远哩！”李顺达说：“乌克兰基洛夫格拉州有一个玉米丰产劳动英雄，去年种了五公顷玉米，每公顷收了二○八·六公担，创造了世界最高的纪录，今年他计划每公顷收二二六公担。同是这块地，在沙皇时代每公顷只能收五、六公担。十月革命胜利集体农庄的粮食产量也是逐年在提高，在战后恢复得很快。一九四六年冬小麦平均每公顷收了八公担，到一九五○年每公顷就收了三十三公担；黑麦一九四六年每公顷收五公担，到一九五○年增加到二十三点二公担。还在不断地提高。”莫日格策说：“卡查赫过去是苦旱的地方，很少长庄稼。现在有了水利灌溉，有的地方小麦每公顷收获量已经达到四十公担；塔尔达库尔干州季米特洛夫集体农庄去年平均每公顷收了二十六公担小麦，最高的达到三十八公担。”
    苏联农业科学家和农民不但能支配植物，使产量小的小麦品种变成产量多的品种，使棉花在一定时间集中开絮，使暖和地方的苹果在寒冷的地方生长；还能支配动物，把粗毛羊变成细毛羊，把狐狸变成家畜，要乳牛多多出奶，要绵羊多生小羊羔。平原省农业劳动模范张学修说：“以前人家说苏联的猪能长六七百斤重，我不相信；在电影上看到了，还是不大相信。这回在苏联一个农庄参观，人家特意把一头猪赶出来给我们看，真是大得怕人；称一下，三百九十八公斤，合中国七百九十六市斤！”杨显亭说：“苏联小块土地也还用马拉摇臂收割机割麦子。我们用同样的收割机，得四匹马拉；人家改良了马种，只用两匹就行了。”他们还说，苏联不但正把粗毛的绵羊变成细毛的绵羊，而且使这些羊的毛和肉都比改良以前增加了一倍。过去每头乳牛一年只产五百到六百公升，现在一年能产三千到四千公升。
    山地也能够集体化、机械化
    山地能不能实行集体化、机械化呢？完全能够。山东省农业劳动模范吕鸿宾说：“我们在格鲁吉亚参观，那里大部都是山地。在大山里，一点平地也没有的地方，不但集体化，而且电气化了。能跑汽车的大马路，可以通到山顶上。山上也有电灯、无线电，磨坊、铁匠、木匠的工作也都是用电力。我们在马哈拉兹区‘舒罗马’（意思是‘劳动’）村参观了阿尔山尼基则集体农庄。这个农庄主要是种茶树、橘子树、柠檬树，养蜜蜂和牛。这个山村，过去可穷啦！他们说：‘我们这个村的男人，过去很不容易找到好媳妇，因为这里生活太困难。现在，很俊的姑娘也愿意到我们这个农庄来了。’在沙皇时代，这个村的农民许多人参加起义，和地主作斗争；有好多人曾经被流放到西伯利亚，有人还和当时被流放的斯大林见过面。革命胜利后，他们都回来了。一个老汉说：‘我们现在在山里还能坐小汽车跑来跑去，真得感谢斯大林！’他们还在山上建筑了一个能容八百观众的俱乐部。一九五一年他们每个劳动日收入了三十二个卢布现金，五公斤小麦，还有一些玉米（他们的粮食有一部分是用茶叶向国家换来的）。莫洛托夫集体农庄也在山地，每个劳动日能分三十九个卢布现金，四公斤半粮食；平均每个劳动力全年做二百六十个劳动日。一般山地比平原的收入都要大。在俄罗斯共和国斯达维罗宝里边区的平原上，一般农庄每个劳动日平均约能分四个到九个卢布现金，三到五公斤粮食。可见山地决不是没有前途的。”李能也说：“我们在阿塞拜疆舒沙区参观，那里是一千多公尺高的山；山下麦子割了很久，山上的麦子还是青的。山上石头不少，可是草也很多。那里的集体农庄以发展畜牧为主。马拉割草机可以上山。坡度在四十五度以下的地都可以用机器耕作，山地用的五铧犁会翻身，来回都把土翻到一边。山上也有自来水，是用机器把水从山下抽上去的。山上的石头、木材便宜，房子比平地盖得还漂亮。山上的汽车路也是柏油路。我家乡（云南省玉溪专区）也是多山的地方，现在只种些稻子、蚕豆，产量很低；以后要照苏联那样发展牧畜和林业。我们那里种了牧草就可以多养羊和水牛；板栗长得很大，多栽一些很能增加收入，别的果木也可以种。只要我们好好干，将来成立起集体农庄来，发展前途是很大的。”
              ×　　　　　×　　　　×
    为什么能够支配大自然？除了集体化、机械化之外，最主要的是讲究科学技术。内蒙农民代表石汝麟说：“苏联的农业是在最先进的科学指导下的农业，轮作、育种、灌溉、施肥等等，都是根据最先进的科学理论进行的。他们把资产阶级反动的农业学说完全打倒了。他们根据科学实验指出：生产力可以无限发展；地越种越少打粮食，净是资产阶级胡说八道。”吕鸿宾说：“苏联的农业，每一个季节做什么，都有科学理论指导着，保险出不了错。生产计划订得那么周密，离开科学是做不到的。”李顺达说：“每个集体农庄，不但和拖拉机站分不开，和育种站、种籽试验站分不开，和国营农场也分不开。大批技术干部和好种籽、好树苗、好奶牛等等，都是国营农场训练、供给的。每个农庄差不多都有自己的技术干部、专家。国家把农民变成了有科学知识的人。”
