    Party Life Brief Commentary
    Strengthen the Party's Leadership over the Communist Youth League

    The experience of the CPC Kezuo Middle Banner Huahushuo District Committee in Inner Mongolia in leading the Communist Youth League organization is good. First, their leadership over the League organization is frequent and specific. They can promote the Party branch and other cadres in the district to pay attention to the work of the League. They can regularly study the situation of the League organization, assign tasks to the League District Committee, and help the League District Committee formulate plans and inspect and summarize work. In this way, some difficulties in the work of the League organization (such as the lack of cadres) and shortcomings in the work (such as the lack of in-depth work and insufficient education for League members) can be resolved and corrected in a timely manner. Second, they can lead the work of the League organization from the actual situation of the League organization. On the one hand, the Huahushuo District Committee often learns about the actual situation and existing problems of the League organization from below; on the other hand, it often reads League documents, studies the instructions of the higher-level League committees, and understands the work intentions and deployments of the higher-level League committees. In this way, the Huahushuo District Committee's leadership over the League organization is neither abstract and formulaic, nor blindly solving problems by addressing them, but combining the instructions and requirements of the higher authorities with the actual situation below to carry out leadership in a purposeful and directional manner. Third, and most importantly, they can enable League cadres and members to understand the Party's policies and the intentions of the District Committee at various times in a timely manner. In this way, League cadres can arrange League work according to these; League members can consciously complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

    The work of the Huahushuo League organization has progressed rapidly, and it has already played a shock role in disaster relief, production competitions, and mutual assistance and cooperation, becoming a powerful assistant to the Party organization's leadership work, which is inseparable from the leadership of the Huahushuo District Committee.

    However, to this day, some Party committees still lack the necessary leadership over the work of the League organization. They usually do not care about or study the work of the League, and even ignore the requests for instructions and reports from League cadres, or simply approve them formally without giving specific guidance. When central tasks or rush tasks arrive, they set aside the League organization and only use a few League cadres who are detached from production. In the League organizations in these places, they often feel that the central work and the League's work are contradictory, or that they cannot keep up with the movement and their work is passive, because they do not take the initiative to accept the leadership of the Party committee, do not understand the Party's policies and the intentions of the Party committee, and lack experience. In this way, although there is a League organization, the role of the broad masses of young people cannot be fully utilized.

    Our country is about to start large-scale economic construction, and we need to mobilize the broad masses of young people to participate in this construction. Because young people are the most active part of the masses, the most receptive to new things, and the most likely to respond to the Party's call and take action first. The League is a tool to assist the Party in mobilizing the broad masses of young people to participate in the revolutionary struggle. Therefore, Party organizations at all levels should not only rely on the League organization to mobilize and organize young people to participate in various struggles, but also educate young people with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, cultivate their communist qualities, and gradually make them useful talents for national construction. In order to achieve this, we believe that the experience of the CPC Huahushuo District Committee in leading the League organization is worth referring to by various places.

    党的生活简评
    加强党对青年团的领导
    中共内蒙古科左中旗花虎硕区委领导青年团组织的经验是好的。首先，他们对团组织的领导是经常的、具体的。他们能够推动党的支部以及区里的其他干部注意团的工作。他们能够定期研究团组织的情况，向团区委交代任务，帮助团区委制订计划和检查、总结工作。这样，团组织工作上的一些困难
    （如干部缺乏等）和工作上的缺点（如工作不深入，对团员的教育不够等），都能及时地得到解决和纠正。其次，他们能够从团组织的实际情况出发，领导团组织的工作。花虎硕区委一方面经常从下面了解团组织的实际情况和存在的问题；一方面经常阅读团的文件，研究上级团委的指示，了解上级团委的工作意图和部署。这样，花虎硕区委对团组织的领导，既不是抽象的公式化的领导，也不是盲目的就问题解决问题，而是把上级的指示、要求和下面的实际情况结合起来，有目的有方向地去进行领导。第三，最重要的是他们能够使团的干部和团员及时了解党的政策和区委各个时期的意图。这样，团的干部可以根据这些来布置团的工作；团员能够自觉地完成党所分配的任务。
    花虎硕团组织的工作所以进展得甚快，并且已经在救灾、生产竞赛、互助合作等工作中发挥了突击作用，成为党组织领导工作的有力助手，是和花虎硕区委的领导分不开的。
    但是，直到今天，还有一些党委对团组织的工作缺乏应有的领导，他们平时不关心也不研究团的工作，甚至对团干部的请示报告也置之不理，或者形式地批一下，从不做具体指导。中心工作或突击任务一到来，就撇开团的组织，只使用几个脱离生产的团的干部。在这些地方的团组织，则往往由于主动地接受党委的领导不够，对党的政策、党委的意图不甚了解，加以缺乏经验，以致不是感觉中心工作和团的工作矛盾，就是感觉跟不上运动，工作被动。这样，虽然有团的组织，但广大青年群众的作用并不能得到充分发挥。
    我们的国家即将开始大规模的经济建设，我们需要发动广大的青年群众参加这一建设。因为青年群众是群众中最活跃的一部分，是最容易接受新鲜事物、最容易响应党的号召首先行动起来的一部分。而团正是协助党动员广大青年群众参加革命斗争的工具。因此，各地党组织不仅应该依靠团组织去发动和组织青年参加各种斗争，并且应该在斗争中以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想教育青年，培养青年的共产主义品质，使他们逐渐成为国家建设的有用人才。为了作到这一点，我们认为中共花虎硕区委领导团组织的经验是值得各地参考的。
