Overcoming Conservative Thinking and Bureaucratic Work Style is Key to Promoting Advanced Experiences
Editorial Department of This Newspaper

Editor's Note: Starting from August 9th, this newspaper has opened a special column on the second page titled "How to Promote Advanced Industrial Experiences" to exchange and discuss the experiences of various enterprises in promoting advanced experiences. Over the past month, many enterprise leaders and workers promoting advanced experiences have reflected many problems and put forward many opinions. Recently, we also invited responsible comrades from several state-owned factories and mines in Beijing to conduct a symposium, and everyone unanimously conducted multi-faceted analysis and criticism of the work methods, bureaucratic work style, and conservative thinking of enterprise leaders. The following is a summary of the main opinions from all parties as a preliminary summary of the leadership work section in the discussion of "How to Promote Advanced Industrial Experiences." Currently, the enthusiasm of the working masses in the movement to promote advanced experiences is full. Once they receive correct and strong leadership, their creativity and enthusiasm will be greatly developed, and the production reform movement will be continuously продвигать forward. This is the basic situation in the work of promoting advanced experiences.

However, on the other hand, in various enterprises, some leading cadres and even the working masses still have serious conservative thinking. Among them, the conservative thinking of leading cadres and improper leadership methods are obstacles to promoting advanced experiences. Many enterprise leaders have not yet well inspired and led the masses to give full play to their creativity and enthusiasm, and many problems have not been resolved in the movement, and the promotion of advanced experiences has not yet formed a mass movement. Although the promotion work in many enterprises was once sensational, the results were not consolidated, and even new chaotic phenomena occurred, causing the promotion work to take a detour.

Shortcomings in leadership methods are very obvious in the work of promoting advanced experiences, and are mainly manifested in the following aspects:

In the promotion of advanced experiences, only general arrangements and appeals are made, and there is a lack of specific leadership and inspection. This is a common problem in leadership work. Some leading cadres often do not study advanced experiences, and do not have a detailed understanding of the equipment conditions, technical level, and ideological situation of their own units. They blindly arrange and call for the promotion of advanced experiences. Some even just read the articles of advanced experience to everyone and consider it done. For example, the Xizhimen Station did not complete the train stopping time stipulated by the higher authorities, and did not conduct in-depth inspections of the shortcomings in the work, but only vaguely asked the masses to find tricks. As a result, many tricks were found, but the key problems were still not resolved. Everyone said: "Finding tricks has become finding evil tricks." Another example is the Jingxi Mining Bureau. The leading cadres only knew that they should set up banners in the movement to promote advanced experiences, but did not consider what conditions the banners should have, how to help them continuously improve, and how to organize the masses to learn from them. As a result, the record of this group is high today and becomes a banner; tomorrow that group has a new record and becomes a model again. The masses call this "labor model handover system." They also don't know who is good and what should be learned from the model. This is enough to show that the promotion of advanced experience is a very complex and meticulous work, and must be carried out with very specific and in-depth leadership. Obviously, this kind of generalized leadership method cannot do a good job in promoting advanced experience.

Another common problem in leadership methods is that they cannot grasp the key issues and blindly promote advanced experiences regardless of priorities. For example, the Jingxi Mining Bureau is currently promoting one or two dozen kinds of advanced experiences. The leadership feels that there are many things to do, and the subordinates feel even more distressed and do not know which one to focus on. Naturally, in the process of promoting advanced experiences, a comprehensive reform of the enterprise must be gradually implemented. However, this does not mean that at the beginning, all the advanced experiences related to the enterprise should be taken together for promotion without focusing on key points. This is bound to fail, because the leadership strength is limited, and the promotion of advanced experiences is a new type of work. There are many problems to be solved in the promotion process. If the strength is dispersed, it will be impossible to cope with the constantly occurring new problems, making the leadership fall into busy and passive, and the key problems will still not be resolved.

The shortcomings in leadership are also manifested in the leadership work lagging behind the masses, especially in the management work not keeping up with the needs of production. Promoting advanced experience must implement scientific management. However, the leaders of many units have insufficient understanding of the profound changes that the promotion of advanced experience will bring about, and have not made good preparations in advance, so that the work in all aspects cannot cooperate in the promotion process. For example, the workers of the Hegang Mining Bureau once accused the leading cadres and said: "We have a cycle (referring to the production instruction chart), but you don't cycle." After the Central Construction Engineering Department's directly affiliated engineering company began to promote advanced experience, more than 30 kinds of new tools alone needed to be supplied in large quantities. Other things, such as changes in construction organization, reasonable allocation of technicians and apprentices, and coordinated cooperation between processes, also need to be resolved in a timely manner. However, the reform of management work is generally slow and passive, and the above problems cannot be solved in a timely manner. If this situation is not changed well, the results of promoting advanced experience cannot be consolidated.

How are these shortcomings in leadership methods produced? This is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of leading cadres, especially the tendency of conservatism in leadership thinking. The conservative thinking of leading cadres is mainly manifested in insufficient estimation of the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and therefore insufficient courage and confidence to overcome difficulties and move forward continuously. This is precisely the ideological foundation of bureaucratic work style.

Most of the main leading cadres in enterprises are veteran cadres who have undergone a long period of revolutionary training, and many of them have been transferred to enterprises from local work or military work. These cadres are loyal to their work. However, on the one hand, because they do not understand the knowledge of industrial production, and many people do not deeply study it; on the other hand, they are accustomed to the past handicraft methods, so they often underestimate the huge production capacity of industry and the potential strength of the working class. This is the main reason for their conservative thinking. For example, Zhang Buke, the general branch secretary of the Qinghe Woolen Mill of the Communist Party of China, once talked about his feelings when he began to promote advanced experience. He said: "At that time, although I also called for the promotion of advanced experience, I did not have confidence myself. I always felt that my cultural level was low, and I was unwilling to study business hard, and I was also afraid to personally lead this work. So I pushed the promotion work to the technicians." Gao Shijin, deputy director of the Northeast Textile Industry Administration Bureau, also pointed out that some leading cadres are "satisfied with their general leadership methods and existing achievements. Some leading cadres think that it is very good if the production plan has been completed or exceeded. They are busy all day with the 'urgent' daily work in front of them, and are blind to the constantly occurring new things," "do not value the creation of the masses, and do not care about the working conditions and life of the masses." Of course, such as attending meetings, reviewing official documents, answering requests... these daily routine tasks are all things that a leader cannot but do, but these are only the simpler part of the leadership work. If an enterprise leader regards these as his main work, and cannot often deeply study production issues, he cannot often pay attention to new things in production, and he cannot well lead production. This kind of disregard for the situation of production is more prominent in some political workers in some enterprises.

Because the main leading cadres in enterprises have a tendency of conservatism in their thinking, the conservative thinking of technicians and grassroots cadres who directly command production cannot be criticized in a timely manner. Engineering technicians in enterprises generally have a tendency to despise the masses and divorce theory from practice. They often regard their own set of outdated theories as inviolable regulations. They do not timely summarize and improve the creations of the masses, and use the creations of the masses to enrich and improve their own theories, but use their own dogmas to bind the creations of the masses. This is the main source of their conservative thinking. For example, a technician from the Qinghe Woolen Mill once reviewed and said: "When I was in school, I studied machines. After I went to the factory, I still thought that only by changing the machines could I improve production. I thought that machines were omnipotent, and people were just turning on the machines. Therefore, I never considered the problems of people." This is a very good explanation. As for the idea of ​​despising the existing creations of the masses, it is even more common among technicians. In the process of promoting advanced experience, many specific technical problems cannot be solved in a timely manner, and conservative technical views are also a big obstacle.

Most of the grassroots cadres in various enterprises are promoted from workers. They have rich production experience, but their cultural level is low and they lack theoretical knowledge, so they are generally bound by empiricism and have great resistance to the promotion of advanced experience. They always say: "I was like this when I was in the workshop in the past, there is nothing!" Some grassroots cadres even ordered workers to use the old methods when promoting advanced experience. The status of grassroots cadres in production is very important. The intentions of the leadership need to be implemented to the masses through them, and the problems in the production of the masses need to be directly solved by them or reflected to the leadership. If the empiricism of these cadres is not broken, the combination of the leadership and the masses will be difficult to achieve, and many problems in the promotion of advanced experience will be difficult to solve.

How to overcome the bureaucratic and conservative thinking of leading cadres? How to improve the leadership methods of enterprise leaders? First of all, it is necessary to constantly go deep into the masses, learn business, and study problems. Comrade Zhang Buke once said that leading cadres can go deep into the workshops, not only learn business, understand the situation, and enhance their confidence, but also help and supervise technicians and workers to combine, and constantly solve technical problems in the promotion for the masses; help grassroots cadres break empiricism from practice. Secondly, leading cadres must constantly summarize and inspect the promotion work. In the promotion of advanced experience, because the masses are learning and creating at the same time, the leadership timely summarizes the creations of the masses, which can not only constantly enrich and improve the advanced experience, and fix the mature things into procedures and systems, but also constantly improve the leadership, so that the management work can keep up with the needs of production. To make enterprise leading cadres do their work well, the higher-level leading organs of various factories and mines also need to constantly educate them, and pay attention to freeing them from the mire of事務主義, especially reducing everyone's meeting time and official document burden, is even more important. For example, Liu Zhiheng, the production minister of the Jingxi Mining Area Trade Union, left the mining area in July and attended meetings for 27 days. How can he learn more about the situation of the masses and production? If this situation is not changed, the improvement of leadership in enterprises is indeed difficult.

    克服保守思想和官僚主义作风是推广先进经验的关键
    本报编辑部
    编者按：本报从八月九日开始，在第二版特辟了“怎样推广工业的先进经验”一栏，交流和讨论各企业推广先进经验的经验。一个多月来，许多企业领导干部和推广先进经验的工作者，曾经反映了许多问题，提出了许多意见。最近，我们又邀请北京市几个国营厂、矿的负责同志进行了一次座谈，大家一致对企业领导干部的工作方法、官僚主义作风和保守思想，进行了多方面的分析与批评。现将各方面的主要意见综述如下，作为“怎样推广工业先进经验”的讨论中关于领导工作部分的一个初步总结。目前推广先进经验运动中，工人群众的情绪是饱满的，一经得到正确的有力的领导，他们的创造性和积极性就将大大发挥，把生产改革运动不断地推向前进。这是推广先进经验工作中的基本情况。
    但是另外一 方面，在各企业中，若干领导干部以至工人群众，也还存在着严重的保守思想，其中特别是领导干部的保守思想和领导方法的不得当，更是推广先进经验的障碍。有许多企业领导干部还没有很好地启发和领导群众充分发挥创造性和积极性，运动中还有很多问题没有得到解决，推广先进经验还没有形成群众运动。有许多企业的推广工作虽然曾经轰动了一下，但成绩却没有巩固，甚至发生了新的混乱现象，使推广工作走了弯路。
    领导方法上的缺点，在推广先进经验的工作中，暴露得十分明显，最主要的表现在以下几个方面：
    推广先进经验中，只做一般的布置号召，缺乏具体领导和检查，是领导工作中的通病。有些领导干部往往对先进经验不加研究，对本单位的设备条件、技术水平和思想情况也不详细了解，就盲目地布置和号召推广先进经验，有的甚至把先进经验的条文向大家念一遍就算完事。例如西直门车站，没有完成上级规定的列车停站时间，又不深入检查工作中的缺点，只笼统地让群众找窍门，结果窍门找了不少，关键问题仍然没有解决。大家都说：“找窍门成了找邪门”。又如京西矿务局，领导干部只知道推广先进经验运动中要树立旗帜，却没有考虑旗帜应该具备什么条件，以及如何帮助他们不断提高，如何组织群众向他们学习。于是，今天这个小组的纪录高了，成为旗帜；明天那个又有了新纪录，又成为模范。群众把这叫做“劳动模范交接班制”。也不知道究竟谁好，究竟该向模范学习什么。这就足以说明，推广先进经验是一件十分复杂细致的工作，必须进行十分具体十分深入的领导。像这种一般化的领导方法，很明显的，是不能把推广先进经验的工作作好的。
    领导方法的另一个通病，就是抓不住关键问题，不分轻重缓急地盲目推广先进经验。比如，京西矿务局目前正在推广的先进经验就有一二十种，领导方面感到头绪纷繁，下面更觉苦恼，不知抓那一个是好。自然，在推广先进经验的过程中，必定要逐步实行企业的全面改革。但是，这不是说，一开始就不分重点地把所有和本企业有关的先进经验都一齐拿来推广。这样作是必定会失败的，因为领导力量有限，推广先进经验又是一种新的工作，推广过程中要解决的问题很多，假如力量分散，就无法应付不断发生的新问题，使领导陷于忙乱被动，而关键问题还得不到解决。
    领导方面的缺点，也表现在领导工作落后于群众，特别表现在管理工作赶不上生产的需要。推广先进经验必须实行科学的管理，但是，许多单位的领导干部对于推广先进经验将要引起的深刻的变化认识不足，事先未做很好的准备，以致在推广过程中各方面的工作都配合不上。例如鹤岗矿务局的工人曾经指责领导干部说：“我们有循环（指生产指示图表），你们不循环。”中央建筑工程部直属工程公司开始推广先进经验后，单只新工具就有三十多种需要大量供应，其它如施工组织的变更、技工徒工的合理调配、工序之间的协调配合等等，也都需要及时解决。但是，管理工作的改革一般说是缓慢被动的，不能及时解决以上问题。这种情况如果不很好改变，推广先进经验的成果就不可能巩固。
    领导方法的这些缺点，是如何产生的呢？这是和领导干部的官僚主义作风，特别是领导思想中的保守主义倾向分不开的。领导干部的保守思想，主要表现在对群众的积极性和创造性估计不足，因而克服困难不断前进的勇气和信心不够。这也正是官僚主义作风的思想基础。
    企业中的主要领导干部，大都是经过长时期革命锻炼的老干部，其中许多是从地方工作或部队工作转入企业的。这些干部对工作是忠心耿耿的。但是一方面由于他们不懂工业生产的知识，很多人又没有深刻地去钻研；另一方面，他们又习惯于过去手工业式的方法，因而对工业的巨大生产能力，对于工人阶级的潜在力量，往往估计不足，这就是他们产生保守思想的主要原因。例如中共清河制呢厂总支书记张布克曾经谈起他在开始推广先进经验时的心情。他说：“那时候虽然也号召推广先进经验，自己可并没有信心。总觉得自己文化水平低，而不愿刻苦钻研业务，也害怕亲自去领导这一工作。于是便把推广工作推给技术人员。”东北纺织工业管理局副局长高士瑾也曾经提出：有些领导干部“满足于自己一般化的领导方法和已有的成绩。有些领导干部认为生产计划已经完成或超过了，就很不错。他们整天忙于眼前‘紧迫’的日常工作，对于不断发生的新鲜事物，熟视无睹”，“不重视群众的创造，不关心群众的劳动条件和生活。”当然，诸如参加会议、批阅公文、答复请示……这些日常的事务性的工作，都是一个领导者所不能不做的工作，但是，这些只是领导工作中比较简单的一部分。假若一个企业领导者把这些当成自己的主要工作，而不能经常深入研究生产问题，他就不能经常注意生产中的新鲜事物，也就不能很好领导生产。这种不问生产的情况，在某些企业中的某些政治工作人员中，表现得更为突出。
    由于企业中主要领导干部思想中有着保守主义倾向，技术人员和直接指挥生产的基层干部的保守思想，也就不能及时地受到批判。企业中的工程技术人员，普遍有着轻视群众和理论脱离实际的倾向。他们往往把自己的一套已经陈腐的理论奉行为不可逾越的法规。他们不是及时地总结和提高群众的创造，用群众的创造来丰富提高自己的理论，而是用自己的教条去束缚群众的创造。这是他们的保守思想的主要根源。例如清河制呢厂的一位技师曾经检讨说：“我在学校时学的是机器，到工厂后还是想着只有改变机器才能提高生产，认为机器是万能的，人不过是开开机器而已，因而从不考虑人的问题。”这就是一个很好的说明。至于轻视群众已有的创造的思想，在技术人员中更为普遍。在推广先进经验过程中，许多具体的技术问题不能及时解决，技术上的保守观点也是一个很大的障碍。
    各企业的基层干部，大多是从工人中提拔出来的。他们的生产经验丰富，但是文化水平较低，缺乏理论知识，因而普遍地受着经验主义的束缚，对于推广先进经验抵触很大。他们总是说：“我过去在车间里时也是这样，没有啥！”有些基层干部，在推广先进经验时，还命令工人用老一套的办法。基层干部在生产中的地位十分重要，领导意图须要由他们贯彻到群众中去，群众生产中的问题须要他们直接解决或者反映到领导方面。这些干部的经验主义不打破，领导和群众的结合就很难实现，推广先进经验中的许多问题也很难得到解决。
    怎样克服领导干部的官僚主义和保守思想呢？怎样改进企业领导人员的领导方法呢？首先必须经常深入群众，学习业务，研究问题。张布克同志曾经谈到，领导干部能够深入到车间去，不但学习了业务，了解了情况，增强了信心，同时还可以帮助和督促技术人员和工人结合，不断为群众解决推广中的技术问题；帮助基层干部从实践中打破经验主义。其次，领导干部还必须不断地对推广工作进行总结、检查。在推广先进经验中，由于群众是在一面学习一面创造，因而领导方面及时地进行总结群众的创造，不但可以使先进经验不断地充实提高，把已经成熟的东西定成规程制度，同时也可以不断地改进领导，使管理工作能够赶上生产的需要。要使企业领导干部把工作作好，还需要各工厂、矿山的上级领导机关不断地对他们进行教育，并注意把他们从事务主义的泥坑中解脱出来，特别是减少大家的开会时间和公文负担，更为重要。例如京西矿区工会生产部长刘志恒，在七月份中就离开矿区，开了二十七天会，他又如何能更多地去了解群众情况与生产情况呢？这种情况如果不改变，企业中领导的改进确是有困难的。
