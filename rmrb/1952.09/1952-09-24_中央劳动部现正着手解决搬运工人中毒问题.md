To the Editor: The "Reader's Letters" page on August 27th published the Chinese Transport Workers' Union Correspondence Group's report on the situation of stevedore poisoning incidents and suggestions for avoiding such incidents. This is a very important issue. Regarding this issue, our ministry had already begun studying solutions before this letter was published, and on August 28th, we invited representatives from the industrial, health, trade, and transport workers' union departments to a meeting to discuss and preliminarily agree on solutions. However, some specific issues still need to be discussed with relevant departments once more, after which regulations can be formulated and submitted to the Government Administration Council for promulgation and implementation.

    中央劳动部现正着手解决搬运工人中毒问题
    编辑同志：八月二十七日“读者来信专页”刊载了中国搬运工会通讯组提出的关于搬运工人中毒事件的情况和避免中毒事件发生的意见，这是很重要的问题。对于这一问题，我部在这封来信发表前已着手研究解决办法，并在八月二十八日邀同工业、卫生、贸易及搬运工会等部门开会讨论，初步商定了解决的办法。但还有一些具体问题尚须与有关部门再交换一次意见，然后即可制订规章，报请政务院通令实施。中央人民政府劳动部办公厅
