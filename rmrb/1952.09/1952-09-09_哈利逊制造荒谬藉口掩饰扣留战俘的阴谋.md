Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th — At the armistice negotiation meeting on September 4th, Harriman again pulled out a tattered old trick. In his speech, filled with foolish slanders and lies, he deceitfully claimed that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war he was plotting to detain were "people seeking refuge."

However, Harriman's excuse for detaining prisoners of war is utterly absurd. The bloody atrocities of the U.S. military in slaughtering and abusing prisoners of war have long been known throughout the world. The barbaric and terrifying POW camps are a microcosm of the "refuge" arranged by the U.S. side. There, the daily life of prisoners of war consists of being shot, beaten, strangled, forced to starve, and subjected to hard labor by the hundreds. The U.S. side absurdly demands that the Korean and Chinese side allow their captured personnel to "relocate to other countries," plotting to send Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war to the same so-called "refuge" – Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit army. Those of our captured personnel who are falsely accused of "seeking refuge" with the U.S. side have always bravely and unyieldingly opposed the so-called "refuge" arranged for them by the U.S. side. They have consistently disregarded the U.S. side's bloody suppression, resolutely demanded repatriation to their homeland, and unyieldingly resisted being forcibly handed over to Chiang Kai-shek, the mortal enemy of the Chinese people, under any pretext. In fact, the absurd excuse used by the U.S. side is itself a complete violation of international law. Everyone understands that personnel captured in war are prisoners of war. Prisoners of war have nothing in common with exiled political prisoners seeking refuge. The Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which the United States also signed, clearly stipulates the status of prisoners of war and their right to be repatriated immediately after the cessation of actual hostilities. Nowhere in the Geneva Convention is it mentioned that prisoners of war can be treated as political prisoners. Moreover, the U.S. side completely obliterates the scope of the military armistice negotiations, attempting to insert an absurd political issue that is fundamentally unrelated to the issue of prisoner repatriation into the military negotiations. This can only prove that the U.S. side is deliberately detaining prisoners of war and has no intention of reaching a ceasefire.

The U.S. side's absurd argument, which conflates the issue of prisoner of war repatriation with the right of political prisoners to asylum, has long been vigorously promoted in the U.S. and British kept newspapers and has been refuted by our side to the point of being worthless. Harriman is now actually bringing it to the meeting as an excuse, which shows how desperate he has become. Observers here point out that any excuse for the U.S. side's conspiracy to detain prisoners of war is untenable. Repatriating all prisoners of war to their homes is fully in line with international law and humanitarianism. Adhering to this reasonable principle is our unshakeable position.

    哈利逊制造荒谬藉口掩饰扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城八日电】在九月四日的停战谈判会议上，哈利逊又拿出了一件早就破烂不堪的法宝。他在他那篇充满愚蠢的诬蔑与撒谎的发言中，诡称他们阴谋扣留的中国人民志愿军战俘是向他们“求讨避难所的人”。
    但是，哈利逊这种扣留战俘的藉口是荒谬绝伦的。美军屠杀与虐待战俘的血淋淋的暴行早已传遍世界。野蛮恐怖的战俘营就是美方所安排的“避难所”的缩景。在那里，战俘的日常生活就是成百地被枪杀、被毒打、被勒死、被迫绝食、被罚苦工。美方荒谬地要求朝中方面允许他们的被俘人员“移居到别的国家”，阴谋把中国人民志愿军战俘送往同样的所谓“避难所”——蒋介石残匪军队。被诬为向美方“求讨避难所”的我方被俘人员，却始终英勇不屈地反对美方为他们所安排的所谓“避难所”。他们始终不顾美方的血腥镇压，坚决要求遣返祖国，毫不屈服地反抗在任何藉口下被强迫送交中国人民的死敌蒋介石。事实上，美方所使用的荒谬藉口本身就是彻底违反国际公法的。谁都明白：在战争中被俘的人员都是战俘。战俘与求讨避难所的流亡政治犯毫无相同之处。美国也参加签字的日内瓦战俘公约明确地规定了战俘的身份与战俘在实际战事停止后立即被遣返的权利。日内瓦公约没有一处提到过战俘可以当作政治犯来处理。而且，美方完全抹杀了军事停战谈判的范围，企图在军事谈判中插入一个与遣俘问题根本无关的荒谬的政治问题，这只能证明美方蓄意扣留战俘，无意达成停战。
    美方这种将战俘遣返问题与政治犯的托庇权混为一谈的荒谬论点，早就在美国和英国的御用报纸上大肆宣传过，并且已经被我方驳斥得一文不值。哈利逊现在竟然把它拿到会议上来作为一种藉口，这说明他已经黔驴技穷到了如何地步。此间观察家指出：美方的任何扣留战俘的阴谋藉口都是站不住脚的。遣返全部战俘回家是完全符合国际法与人道主义的。坚持这一合情合理的原则乃是我方不可动摇的立场。
