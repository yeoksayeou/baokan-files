	Studying the Literature on Literature, Art, and Philosophy by Zhdanov
	Zheng Yinan
	Zhdanov’s speeches on literature, art, and philosophy "are an important contribution to the development of Marxist-Leninist theory." (Molotov's words)

	In his “Speech at the First All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers” in August 1934 and his “Report on the Journals ‘Zvezda’ and ‘Leningrad’” in September 1946, Zhdanov elaborated and developed the basic Marxist view that literature and art are the superstructure of a certain economic base. He profoundly pointed out that the success of Soviet literature is due to the success of socialist construction. Its growth is a reflection of the success of the socialist system. Although Soviet literature is the youngest literature among all nations and countries, because it is the literature of the rising class (the proletariat), the only progressive and advancing class, and the literature that serves the new cause—the cause of socialist construction—it is the most ideological, the most progressive, and the most revolutionary literature in the world.

	The world's most progressive proletarian literature and bourgeois literature are in an irreconcilable and mutually opposing position. Bourgeois literature aims to harm the interests of the proletariat and conceal the decadent capitalist system. Zhdanov pointed out that due to the decline and decay of the capitalist system, bourgeois literature cannot but decline and corrupt. "The rampant mysticism and monasticism, the enthusiasm for erotic literature—these are characteristic phenomena of the decline and decay of bourgeois culture. The... 'famous figures' in bourgeois literature have now become thieves, spies, prostitutes, and hooligans."

	Zhdanov elaborated on the principle of Party spirit in literature stipulated by Lenin—“Literature cannot be non-Party; it should be an important component of the overall cause of the proletariat.” He said: "In the era of class struggle, there is not and cannot be a classless, tendenceless, and seemingly non-political literature. '...And we are proud of this tendency, because our tendency lies in liberating the workers—all mankind—from the yoke of capitalist enslavement.'"

	The Party spirit of Bolshevik literature is absolutely incompatible and completely opposed to any form of lack of ideology, lack of principle, non-political nature, and kowtowing to decadent bourgeois literature. Zhdanov said: "Leninism believes that our literature has great social and educational significance. If our Soviet literature allows a reduction in this huge educational role—this is tantamount to going backwards, 'returning to the Stone Age.'"

	Why could these stains, which are opposed to the Party spirit of our literature, appear in the Soviet Union at that time and gain active room for maneuver? Zhdanov pointed out when analyzing the root causes of the mistakes of the two journals "Zvezda" and "Leningrad" that this was because they had forgotten the basic principles of Leninism regarding literature, they "all thought that politics—this is the business of the government, the business of the Party Central Committee. As for writers, engaging in politics is not their business." At the same time, it was also because Soviet writers at that time "were far away from our Soviet themes today: on the one hand, they one-sidedly indulged in historical themes; on the other hand, they attempted to write some purely entertaining and empty themes." That is to say, they adopted methods that violated socialist realism to "create". What is the method of socialist realism? Zhdanov stipulated it this way: "The authenticity and historical concreteness of artistic descriptions must be combined with the task of ideologically transforming and educating the working people in the spirit of socialism."

	Zhdanov profoundly expounded Stalin’s famous definition of “writers are engineers of the human soul.” He said: Our writers are engineers of the human soul, "that is to say, first, to know life in order to be good at truthfully describing it in literary and artistic works, but this description is not trivial, rigid, nor is it merely described as an 'objective reality', but to describe reality as it is in revolutionary development."

	In his speech on literature, Zhdanov stipulated the tasks of Soviet authors and all ideological workers in this way: "Not only should we respond to this shameless slander and attack on our Soviet culture and socialism by hitting back at the attackers, but also boldly rebuke and attack the bourgeois culture in a state of weakness and decay."

	At the Soviet Musicians Conference held by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in January 1948, Zhdanov also sharply exposed the struggle between the realistic tendency and the formalistic tendency in Soviet music in his speech. He said:

	"In our Soviet music, there is indeed a very sharp struggle between two tendencies, although it is outwardly concealed. One tendency is the healthy and progressive element in Soviet music, which is based on recognizing the great significance of classical heritage, especially the traditions of the Russian music school, combining the lofty ideas and content of music, the authenticity and reality of music, with deep and organic connection with the people and their musical and song creation, and coordinating with advanced specialized skills. The other tendency is formalism, which is indifferent to Soviet art, and abandons classical heritage, abandons the people's nature of music, and abandons serving the people under the banner of false innovation, and satisfies the personal feelings and experiences that are particularly emphasized by a small group of excellent aesthetes."

	Zhdanov analyzed in detail and condemned the anti-people nature of the formalistic tendency in music and the decadence of Western bourgeois music. He pointed out that the result of formalism is the destruction of music and the cancellation of music. And some formalistic musicians, who are determined to break away from the people to such a serious extent, that there is such a "theory" prevalent among them—"we will be understood in fifty or one hundred years", "if modern people cannot understand us, then later generations will understand us." Zhdanov resolutely refuted this fundamental anti-people "theory" that openly calls on people to shrink into the ivory tower and isolate themselves from the outside world. He said: "If I—a writer, painter, literary artist, Party worker—do not consider that I will be understood by modern people, then for whom do I work and live? This will lead to spiritual emptiness and a dead end."

	What is particularly important is Zhdanov's elaboration on the relationship between internationalism and national art in art. He said:

	"Internationalism in art is not born on the basis of the narrowing and impoverishment of national art. On the contrary, internationalism is born where national art is flourishing. Forgetting this truth means losing the route of leadership, losing one's own face, and becoming a rootless and unpatriotic cosmopolitan. ...People who do not truly love their own motherland cannot become internationalists in the field of music. ...If the basis of internationalism is respect for other nations, then people who do not love their own nation cannot become internationalists."

	Zhdanov completely exposed the coat of the formalistic tendency—"innovation." He pointed out that this "innovation" only revises the foundation of music, creating detachment from the people, detachment from true art, and true science and literature.

	At the end of his speech, Zhdanov called on Soviet musicians to wage an irreconcilable struggle against the formalistic tendency, adhere to and develop the realistic tendency, and strive harder to complete the great development and improvement of Soviet music, defend Soviet music, and prevent it from being invaded by the collapsing elements of the bourgeoisie. For this reason, the musical ears of Soviet musicians are their political ears, and they should be very sensitive.

	Zhdanov has made significant contributions in philosophy. His speech "At the Discussion Meeting on the Book 'History of Western European Philosophy' by Alexandrov" in June 1947 is beneficial not only to philosophy workers, but also to all ideological workers. Starting from the definitions of scientific philosophy by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, Zhdanov gave a uniquely correct definition of the object of the history of philosophy: "The history of scientific philosophy is the history of the origin, occurrence, and development of the scientific materialist world view and its laws." "The history of philosophy is also the history of the struggle of materialism against idealism."

	Zhdanov believes that the emergence of Marxism is a real great discovery, a revolution in philosophy. The new philosophy created by Marx and Engels is qualitatively different from previous philosophical systems, no matter how progressive they are. On the contrary, it represents the end and "final demise" of all pre-Marxist old philosophy.

	When analyzing this philosophical revolution and fundamental qualitative change, Zhdanov narrated the relationship between philosophy and science. He said:

	"Marxist philosophy, unlike many previous philosophical systems, is not a science that reigns over other sciences, but a tool for scientific research, a method that runs through all sciences related to nature and society, and enriches itself with the achievements accumulated by these sciences in their development process." That is to say, from Marx onwards, philosophy began a new life—philosophy became a science for the first time.

	In fundamental contrast to the old philosophy, Marxism is its thorough negation. But negation is not simple abandonment; it itself "contains inheritance, and means absorbing, critically transforming, and uniting everything that has been achieved in the history of human thought in a new and higher synthesis."

	The difference between Marxist philosophy and old philosophy also lies in its open recognition and adherence to the Party spirit of philosophy, and its advocacy of dialectical materialism as the world view of the proletariat. The Party spirit principle of dialectical materialism is manifested in adhering to the attitude of irreconcilable struggle of materialism against idealism. Zhdanov cited Lenin's point of view to tell us: "Materialism itself contains so-called Party spirit, and it must directly and openly stand on the viewpoint of a certain social group when criticizing any event." Obviously, the Party spirit in philosophy is only a reflection of class struggle on the ideological front.

	Zhdanov severely condemned the abstract, objectivist, neutral tendencies and non-political nature that exist among philosophy workers and violate the Party spirit principle. He condemned certain philosophy workers for "always burning incense and paying 'tribute' to his merits before criticizing any bourgeois philosopher." Zhdanov said that this is a characteristic of being captured by bourgeois philosophers. "Because the starting point of bourgeois historians of philosophy is to first see professional allies in every philosopher, and then see enemies." Zhdanov also ruthlessly ridiculed those philosophy workers who ignore modern themes and are accustomed to making trivial and empty arguments about those problems that have long been solved (such as the Hegel problem). He said: This kind of argument is as meaningless as the argument about "whether the Virgin Mary is a virgin." Zhdanov taught that our philosophy workers should analyze and summarize socialist construction, the revolutionary movement of the international proletariat, the achievements of modern natural science, and resolutely oppose various forms of "trends of thought" of financial philosophy.

	Zhdanov explained the great and special role of criticism and self-criticism in Soviet society. He profoundly pointed out that criticism and self-criticism are new forms of movement and new laws of dialectics in the development of socialist society. Therefore, he called on philosophy workers to carry out criticism and self-criticism in order to break the sluggish situation in the philosophical circles and adhere to and strengthen the Bolshevik philosophical front!

	Zhdanov's speech has special and significant theoretical and practical significance for the development and progress of our country's literature, art, and philosophy, as well as all ideological work. On the occasion of commemorating the fourth anniversary of Zhdanov's death, let our literature, art, philosophy, and all ideological workers study Zhdanov's works and further consolidate and develop our ideological front!

    学习日丹诺夫论文学、艺术与哲学诸问题的文献
    郑毅男
    日丹诺夫关于文学、艺术与哲学诸问题的讲演辞，“是马克思主义与列宁主义理论发展中的重要贡献”。（莫洛托夫语）
    在一九三四年八月“在第一次全苏联作家代表大会上的演辞”和一九四六年九月“关于‘星’和‘列宁格勒’两杂志的报告”中，日丹诺夫发挥和发展了马克思主义关于文学艺术是一定经济基础的上层建筑的基本观点。他深刻地指出，苏联文学的成功，是由于社会主义建设的成功而成功的。它的成长，就是社会主义制度的成功的反映。苏联文学虽然是各民族和各国家当中最年青的一种文学，但因为它是属于上升的阶级（无产阶级）的唯一进步的和前进的阶级的文学，是为新的事业——社会主义建设的事业而服务的文学，所以它是世界上最有思想的、最进步的和最革命的文学。
    全世界最进步的无产阶级文学与资产阶级文学是处在不可调和的相互对立的地位的。资产阶级文学是以损害无产阶级利益和掩饰腐朽的资本主义制度为目的的。日丹诺夫指出：由于资本主义制度的堕落和腐朽，资产阶级文学也就不能不堕落和腐化。“神秘主义和僧道主义的猖獗，色情文学的热中——这对于资产阶级文化的衰颓与腐朽都是特征的现象。资产阶级文学当中的……‘有名的人物’，现在已成为盗贼、特务、娼妓和流氓了。”
    日丹诺夫发挥了为列宁所规定的文学的党性原则——“文学不可能是非党的，它应该是无产阶级的总的事业的一个重要组成部分”。他说：“在阶级斗争的时代，没有并且也不可能有一种无阶级、无倾向和仿佛是非政治的文学。‘……而且我们还因为这种倾向性引以为骄傲，因为我们的倾向，是在于将劳动者——将全人类从资本主义的奴役的枷锁之下解放出来。’”
    布尔什维克文学的党性与任何样式的无思想性、无原则性、非政治性和屈膝于腐朽的资产阶级文学，都是绝对不相容的和完全对立的。日丹诺夫说：“列宁主义认为我们的文学，具有重大的社会教育意义。假如我们苏联文学允许降低这一巨大的教育作用，——这就等于说，向后倒退，‘回返到石器时代去’。”
    为什么和我们的文学的党性原则对立着的这些污物，当时会在苏联出现并能得到活跃的余地呢？——日丹诺夫在分析“星”和“列宁格勒”两杂志错误的根源时指出，——这是因为他们忘记了列宁主义关于文学的基本原则，他们“都以为政治——这是政府的事情，是党中央的事情。至于讲到作家们，从事政治那并不是他们的事情。”同时，也因为当时苏联的作家“远离开我们今天苏联的题材：一方面，他们片面地热中于历史题材；另一方面，企图写一些纯粹供消遣的空洞无物的主题。”这就是说，他们采取了违背社会主义的现实主义的方法去“创作”。什么是社会主义现实主义的方法呢？日丹诺夫这样规定：“艺术描写的真实性和历史具体性，必须和以社会主义的精神在思想上改造及教育劳动人民的任务相结合。”
    日丹诺夫深邃地阐发了斯大林关于“作家是人类灵魂的工程师”的有名定义。他说：我们的作家是人类灵魂的工程师，“这就是说，第一，要知道生活，以便善于在文艺作品中把它真实地描写出来，但这种描写并不是烦琐的、死板的，也不只是作为‘客观的现实’来描写的，而要把现实按它在革命发展当中的情形描写出来。”
    日丹诺夫在关于文学问题的演说中这样规定苏联作者和一切思想工作者的任务：“不仅要给打击者以打击，来回答这种无耻的诽谤和对我们苏联文化和社会主义的攻击，还要大胆地斥责和攻击在衰弱与腐朽状态中的资产阶级的文化。”
    在一九四八年一月联共（布）中央召开的苏联音乐家会议上，日丹诺夫在他发表的演说中还尖锐地揭露了苏联音乐中的现实主义倾向和形式主义倾向的斗争。他说：
    “我们苏维埃音乐中的确有着很尖锐的、虽然外表上还掩饰着的两种倾向的斗争。一种倾向是苏维埃音乐中健全的、进步的因素，它建立基础于承认古典遗产、特别是俄罗斯音乐学派传统的巨大地位，把音乐的崇高的思想和内容、音乐的真实性和现实性结合起来，和人民及其音乐的、歌曲的创作深入地、有机地联系起来，和高级的专门技巧配合起来。另一种倾向所表现的是和苏维埃艺术漠不相关的形式主义，是在虚伪的革新的旗帜之下摈弃古典遗产、摈弃音乐的人民性、摈弃向人民服务而满足少数优秀的唯美主义者集团所特别着重的个人的感触体验”。
    日丹诺夫详细地剖析了，并且谴责了音乐中形式主义倾向的反人民性，和倒拜于西方资产阶级音乐的颓废主义。他指出：形式主义的结果就是破坏音乐和取消音乐。而某些形式主义的音乐家，他们决心脱离人民竟严重到如此地步，在他们中间流行着这样一种“理论”——“我们是会在五十年、一百年之后被了解的”，“假使现代人不能了解我们，那末后世是会了解我们的”。日丹诺夫坚决地反驳这种公开召唤人们缩进象牙之塔和外界绝缘的根本反人民的“理论”。他说：“假使我——作家、画家、文学家、党工作者——不估计到我会被现代人了解，那么我是为谁工作和生活的呢？这会造成精神上的空虚和绝路。”
    尤为重要的是，日丹诺夫对艺术中的国际主义和民族艺术的关系问题的发挥。他说：
    “艺术中的国际主义并不是诞生在民族艺术缩小和贫乏的基础上的。正相反，国际主义是诞生在民族艺术兴旺的地方。忘记这条真理，——就表示是丧失领导的路线，丧失自己的脸容，成为没祖没宗的宇宙主义者。……不真正热爱自己祖国的人，就不能成为音乐领域中的国际主义者，……假使国际主义的基础是尊敬其他民族，那么不敬爱自己的民族的人，就不能成为国际主义者。”
    日丹诺夫完全地揭穿了形式主义倾向的外衣——“革新”。他指出：这种“革新”只是修改音乐的基础，造成了脱离人民、脱离真正的艺术和真正的科学与文学。
    在演说结束时，日丹诺夫号召苏联音乐家向形式主义倾向做不调和的斗争，坚持和发展现实主义倾向，为完成伟大的发展和改善苏维埃音乐、保卫苏维埃音乐和使其避免受到资产阶级的崩溃因素的侵入而更加努力。为此，苏联音乐家的音乐耳朵就是他们的政治耳朵，它们都是应该非常敏感的。
    日丹诺夫在哲学方面有重大的贡献。一九四七年六月他“在关于亚历山大洛夫著‘西欧哲学史’一书讨论会上的演辞”中的发言，不仅对于哲学工作者，就是对于一切思想工作者也都是有益的。日丹诺夫从马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的关于科学的哲学的定义出发，给哲学史的对象下了一个唯一正确的定义：“科学的哲学史是科学的唯物论世界观及其法则的起源、发生和发展的历史。”“哲学史也就是唯物论向观念论斗争的历史。”
    日丹诺夫认为：马克思主义的发生是真正的一大发现，是哲学上的革命。马克思和恩格斯创造的新哲学，在质的方面，非但不同于以前的无论怎样进步的哲学体系，相反，它表示着所有马克思主义以前的旧哲学之结束和“寿终正寝”。
    日丹诺夫在分析这个哲学上的革命和根本质变时，叙述了哲学和科学的关系。他说：
    “马克思主义哲学，和以前许多哲学体系不同，它并不是君临在其他科学之上的科学，而是科学研究的工具，是贯通一切有关自然和社会的科学，并以这些科学在它们发展过程中所蓄积的成果来丰富自己的方法。”这就是说，从马克思起，哲学开始了新生命——哲学第一次变成为科学。
    与旧哲学根本相反，马克思主义是它的彻底的否定。但否定并不是简单的抛弃，它本身“包含着继承性，表示着在新的更高的综合中吸收、批判地改造和联合人类思想史上所已经达到的前进和进步的一切。”
    马克思主义哲学和旧哲学的区别：还在于它公开承认和坚持哲学的党性，主张辩证唯物论是无产阶级的世界观。辩证唯物论的党性原则，表现在坚持唯物论对唯心论的不可调和的斗争的态度上。日丹诺夫援引列宁的论点，告诉我们：“唯物论本身包含着所谓党性，它必须在批判任何事件时直接和公开地站在一定社会集团的观点上。”显然，哲学上的党性，只是阶级斗争在思想战线上的反映。
    日丹诺夫严厉地斥责了哲学工作者中存在的与党性原则相违背的抽象的、客观主义的、中立的倾向和非政治性。斥责了某些哲学工作者“在批判任何一个资产阶级哲学家之前，总是先向他的功绩焚香朝‘贡’一番”。日丹诺夫说，这是做了资产阶级哲学家的俘虏的特征。“因为资产阶级哲学史家的出发点就是要在每一个哲学家身上先看到职业上的盟友，然后才看到敌人的。”日丹诺夫对于那种忽视现代主题，而习惯于对那些早已解决了的问题（如黑格尔问题）作烦琐空虚的争论的哲学工作者也给以无情地嘲笑。他说：这种争论正像关于“圣母是不是处女”的争论一样是没有任何意义的。日丹诺夫教导说：我们的哲学工作者应该分析和总结社会主义建设，国际无产阶级的革命运动，现代自然科学的成果，和坚决反对金元哲学的各种样式的“思潮”。
    日丹诺夫说明了批评和自我批评在苏维埃社会中的重大的特殊作用。他深刻地指出：批评和自我批评是社会主义社会发展的新的运动形式、新的辩证法规律。因而，他号召哲学工作者必须开展批评和自我批评，以打破哲学界的不景气的局面，坚持和加强布尔什维克的哲学阵线！
    日丹诺夫的演说对我国的文学、艺术与哲学以及一切思想工作的发展和前进有特殊重大的理论和实践的意义。在纪念日丹诺夫逝世四周年的日子里，让我们的文学、艺术、哲学和一切思想工作者来学习日丹诺夫的著作，更进一步地巩固和发展我们的思想战线吧！
