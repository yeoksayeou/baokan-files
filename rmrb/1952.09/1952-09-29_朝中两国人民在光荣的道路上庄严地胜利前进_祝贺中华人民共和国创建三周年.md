    The People of Korea and China Advance Victoriously and Solemnly on the Glorious Road
    —Congratulations on the Third Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China
    Hong Chun-cheol, Head of the Former Korean People's Delegation to China

    The Korean people, together with friends all over the world, are welcoming the third anniversary of the founding of our great friend, the People's Republic of China.
    The victory of the Chinese people's liberation movement and the founding of the People's Republic of China have powerfully struck at the imperialist system and all the plans of the new war provocateurs. The revolutionary victory won by the great Chinese people, who account for a quarter of the world's population, means that the invincible strength of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union, has become even stronger.
    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the founding of the People's Republic of China have not only transformed the huge rear area of imperialism in the center of Asia into a powerful force for peace and democracy, but also clearly show the characteristics of the historical process: everything is developing in a direction unfavorable to the imperialist camp, and all roads lead to the victory of people's democracy and the victory of socialism and communism.
    The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the birth of People's China are another epoch-making great victory in the revolutionary movement of the people of the world after the success of the great socialist October Revolution and the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War. It makes us firmly believe that the aggressive adventures of the US imperialists in Asia will inevitably end in a disastrous defeat. The heroic struggle waged by the Korean People's Army with the assistance of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers will surely be victorious. The unification and independence of the Korean people will surely be realized.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have created People's China. Over the past three years, they have achieved great achievements on all fronts—political, military, economic, and cultural—in the struggle to defend and develop the victory of the revolution. These achievements have been further consolidated through movements such as resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns.
    The people of the world are unanimously convinced that the rapid development of New China will make even greater contributions to all mankind.
    Today, the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea launched by the Chinese people shows that the Chinese people are not only able to defend their motherland, but have also become a great force for defending peace in the East.
    The birth of New China has bankrupted the US imperialists' plan to invade the Far East. In order to realize its aggressive ambitions, US imperialism is frantically carrying out a criminal war of aggression in our Korea.
    The people of Korea and China have forged an inseparable friendship due to their historically interdependent common interests. Today, in order to resist our common enemy, the US imperialists, the Chinese people are holding high the banner of "Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea" and actively supporting the great anti-aggression war of the Korean people.
    The fighting friendship and solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples has further strengthened the forces of the peace and democracy camp against imperialist aggression, making a great contribution to the sacred cause of defending lasting peace and security for mankind. Today, the movement to defend peace powerfully launched by the people of the world is growing stronger day by day. The Asian and Pacific Peace Conference held in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, demonstrated the firm will of millions of people to defend peace. It will severely strike at the evil conspiracy of war provocateurs who vainly attempt to drag the world into the abyss of a new world war.
    The Korean people, amid the congratulations and gratitude of the entire nation, welcome the third anniversary of the founding of our comrade-in-arms country, the country that aids us, our great neighbor—the People's Republic of China. The Korean people extend their heartfelt comradely handshake and lofty honor to the great Chinese people who have forever escaped disaster, poverty, and darkness, and are bravely advancing along the path of freedom, happiness, and light.
    The internationalist friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples cannot be destroyed by any force. The victorious example of the internationalist friendship forged by the Korean and Chinese peoples in the common anti-aggression struggle will forever radiate brilliant light in human history!

    朝中两国人民在光荣的道路上庄严地胜利前进
    ——祝贺中华人民共和国创建三周年
    前朝鲜人民访华代表团团长  洪淳哲
    朝鲜人民和全世界的朋友们一起迎接着我们伟大的友邦中华人民共和国创建三周年。
    中国人民解放运动的胜利和中华人民共和国的创建，有力地打击了帝国主义的体系和新战争挑拨者的一切计划。占全世界人口四分之一的伟大的中国人民所获得的革命胜利，意味着以伟大的苏联为首的和平民主与社会主义阵营不可战胜的力量更加强大了。
    中国人民革命的胜利和中华人民共和国的创建，不但使处于亚洲中心位置的帝国主义的巨大后方，转变成了强大的和平民主力量，而且清楚地显示出历史行程的特征：一切情形正朝着对帝国主义阵营不利的方向发展，条条大路通往人民民主的胜利和社会主义、共产主义的胜利。
    中国人民革命的胜利和人民中国的诞生，是全世界人民的革命运动继伟大的社会主义十月革命成功和世界反法西斯战争胜利之后的又一个划时代的伟大胜利。它使我们坚定不移地确信：美帝国主义者在亚洲进行的侵略冒险，必将以惨败而告终。朝鲜人民军在兄弟般的中国人民志愿军协助之下所进行的英雄斗争，必将胜利。朝鲜人民的统一和独立，必将实现。
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，创建了人民中国，三年来，在保卫和发展革命胜利的斗争中，在政治、军事、经济、文化各个战线上，都获得了巨大的成就。通过抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命和“三反”“五反”等运动，这些成就已更加巩固。
    全世界人民一致确信新中国的飞跃发展，必将对全人类作出更巨大的贡献。
    今天中国人民展开着的抗美援朝运动，表明中国人民不但能够保卫自己的祖国，而且已成为保卫东方和平的伟大力量。
    新中国的诞生，使美帝国主义侵略远东的计划破产。美帝国主义为了实现其侵略野心，正在我们朝鲜疯狂地进行着罪恶的侵略战争。
    朝中两国人民由于在历史上有着唇齿相依的共同利害关系，结成了血肉不可分离的友谊。今天，为了反抗我们的共同敌人美帝国主义者，中国人民高举“抗美援朝”的旗帜，积极地援助着朝鲜人民伟大的反侵略战争。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民之间的战斗友谊和团结，进一步加强了反对帝国主义侵略的和平民主阵营的力量。对于保卫人类持久和平与安全的神圣事业，作着伟大的贡献。今天，全世界人民强有力地展开着的保卫和平运动，正在日益成长壮大。在中华人民共和国首都北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，表现了千百万人民保卫和平的坚强意志。它将沉重地打击战争挑拨者妄图把全世界拖入新的世界大战深渊的罪恶阴谋。
    朝鲜人民在全民族的祝贺和感激中，迎接我们战友的国家、援助我们的国家、我们伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国创建三周年。朝鲜人民谨向永远摆脱了灾难、贫困与黑暗，循着自由幸福光明的道路英勇前进的伟大的中国人民，致以深切的战友的握手和崇高的荣誉。
    朝中两国人民国际主义的友谊团结，是任何力量也破坏不了的。朝中两国人民在共同的反侵略战斗中结成的国际主义友谊的胜利榜样，将在人类历史上，永远放射着灿烂的光芒！
