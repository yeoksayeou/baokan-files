Editor's Note: Since the beginning of this year, various forms of material exchange conferences have been held across the country. These conferences have achieved great results, but also have some shortcomings and problems to varying degrees. The opinions put forward by Vice Chairman Zeng Shan of the East China Military and Political Committee in this report have solved many common problems in material exchange conferences and can be used as a reference for various regions.

Zeng Shan, Vice Chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, summarized the work of urban and rural material exchange in the East China region in the first half of this year at the joint meeting of employee representatives from the five departments of East China State-owned Trade, Finance, Transportation, Taxation, and Cooperation. Zeng Shan pointed out that the work of urban and rural material exchange in East China has achieved great results in the first half of this year. Many material exchange conferences in the first half of this year were held under the personal leadership or direct control of responsible comrades from provinces, special districts, and counties. Through the exchange conferences, the market was activated, and the difficulties of industrial and agricultural production were resolved; the sluggish market situation after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements was quickly changed; the people's government's policy of encouraging private enterprises to operate legitimately was implemented; industrial and agricultural production was maintained and developed, and production and sales were communicated, production guidance was strengthened, and the direction of operation was changed.

Zeng Shan pointed out that there are still some shortcomings in the work of urban and rural material exchange in the East China region.

I. Some cadres have unclear policy thinking and do not have a deep enough understanding of the important significance of urban and rural exchanges as instructed by higher authorities. First of all, they believe that urban and rural exchanges are mainly to solve the difficulties in the off-season and the problem of unsalable goods, and they fail to deeply understand that urban and rural exchanges are an important form of commercial activity in the New Democracy; the role of urban and rural exchanges is to link production and sales through material exchanges and resolve production and sales contradictions; and it can promote production and sales, making the decentralized free market a more organized and led market. Therefore, it should be held not only in the off-season but also in the peak season. Secondly, some cadres still have the two biases of "rather be left than right" and "rather be tight than loose" in their understanding of the policy on private industry and commerce, and they believe that exchange conferences are simply to take care of private industry and commerce. The former is the failure to recognize the certain role of private industry and commerce in the current economic construction of New Democracy; the latter is the thought of unprincipled care and simple accommodation, which will make private merchants have dependence and even speculation, which is not in line with the policy requirements of encouraging private merchants to operate legitimately.

II. The relevant economic departments do not have a clear enough understanding of the idea that "urban and rural exchange work" should become a common task, and they have not been able to closely coordinate and work in a unified manner. In the past, the trade department did not pay enough attention to the planned and reasonable adjustment of price differences and the improvement of market management, and there were still unreasonable regional price differences and retail and wholesale price differences. Some commodities make it unprofitable for private merchants to transport and sell, which hinders the reasonable profits of private commerce; in market management, there are too many licenses, which is also unfavorable to the legitimate operation of private merchants. Tax authorities, banks, and transportation departments also have phenomena of not paying attention or not attaching importance to the point of hindering material exchange, which must be improved.

III. Under the requirement of quickly revitalizing the market, individual regions have a task-oriented view in holding urban and rural exchange conferences, and formalism, coercion, and extravagance have begun to occur. Some regions do not determine the form and content of the exchange conference according to the production and sales situation and local requirements, but hold the conference in order to complete the task of holding the exchange conference, which leads to coercion and formalism. This approach is harmful and should be strictly corrected and prevented.

IV. There is a lack of investigation and research, the production and sales situation is not well understood, and there is even blind exchange, pursuing transaction figures, and assigning tasks to state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private merchants. In addition, some cadres do not pay enough attention to the further development from urban and rural exchanges to domestic and foreign exchanges, and have not given full play to the enthusiasm of import and export merchants with operating capabilities, resulting in the failure to export some domestic local products in a timely manner. This should be paid attention to in future exchange conferences.

Zeng Shan talked about several experiences in the work of urban and rural material exchange in the East China region and said:

I. Urban and rural material exchange conferences are the best way to give play to the enthusiasm of private merchants under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and they are also a good form of commercial activity in the New Democracy. It is an important link connecting production and consumption, which can not only solve the difficulties in the off-season and revitalize the market, but also has a profound role in guiding production and ensuring planned production. Through material exchange conferences, production and sales can be communicated, so that producers can improve and expand production according to sales and social needs. At the same time, private industrialists and merchants can be led in a planned way through exchange conferences to give play to the business enthusiasm of private merchants that is conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

II. Exchange meetings of different forms should be held according to different markets and different situations, and attention should be paid to mutual response and mutual promotion from top to bottom in order to exert a greater effect. According to past experience, exchange meetings cannot be held blindly. Exchange meetings of different forms must be held according to different market economic conditions and the gaps in the production season. Generally speaking, there are three market forms of exchange conferences: advanced, intermediate, and primary. A. Advanced market exchange form (such as the East China Urban and Rural Material Exchange Conference): Its characteristic is that it is mainly based on large-volume wholesale, with state-owned companies as the main body, combined with cooperatives, and uniting the majority of industrialists and merchants to conduct direct exchanges. Through such a conference, the exchange of large-volume materials can be expanded to solve the needs of production and consumption in different regions. Therefore, advanced market exchange conferences should be held in a planned and prepared manner before the arrival of the off-season of production and the peak season of consumption. The transaction volume of this type of meeting is large, which directly affects social production and consumption needs. Therefore, the planning of exchanges must be strengthened to prevent excessive exchanges in the off-season of production, which affects the overall supply in the peak season, or blind production. In the peak season of sales exchanges, the situation of blind transactions and speculative hoarding should be prevented. At the same time, we must pay attention to leading and inspecting the performance of contracts to ensure the implementation of transaction contracts. B. Intermediate market exchange form (such as regional exchange conferences held in medium-sized cities in various provinces): The nature of this type of exchange conference is the same as that of advanced market exchange conferences, but the regional scope is slightly smaller than that of advanced markets. However, the representatives participating in the exchange should be more in-depth and universally mobilized, and should adapt to the characteristics of decentralized counties and towns and small operating capabilities, try to organize short-distance exchanges and small-amount transactions, and can combine with retail business to prepare for the primary market. However, the meeting time should not be too long, and too many long-term contracts should not be signed. Therefore, the number of such meetings can be slightly more than that of advanced exchange conferences, and can be held before and after advanced market exchange conferences. C. Primary market exchange form: 1. It is a gathering form mainly based on retail business facing the masses, and is also a direct transaction between local specialty vendors, industrial products and handicraft retailers, and farmers. The time should not be too long. The business policy should meet the requirements of farmers and implement the principle of willing buying and selling. For example, the exchange conferences in Danyang, Fangxian District, and Jiaxing are successful examples. 2. Add organization and leadership to the old forms such as old temple fairs, mountain fairs, mule and horse fairs, medicinal material fairs, and market fairs to further give play to their role in facilitating farmers to exchange products. 3. The business work of the exchange meeting should be led by the cooperative, and the state-owned company can temporarily send purchasing or sales teams to revitalize the market and give play to the role of leading private merchants. 4. The content of the conference should focus on purchasing and sales, combined with cultural and entertainment propaganda and education work. Purchasing and sales is to facilitate farmers, and cultural and entertainment propaganda is to revitalize the market and educate farmers.

III. Strengthen investigation and research, understand and master the production and sales situation, prevent the blindness of material exchange, and strengthen planning in order to further exert the role of material exchange conferences. This year, material exchange conferences in various places have paid attention to overcoming blindness and strengthening planning. Everyone is very cautious when signing contracts, and they can seriously implement them after signing contracts. However, due to the vast area of our country, dispersed production, and easy changes in production and sales, careful consideration should be given before signing contracts, and contracts should only be signed if there is certainty. If exchanges cannot be carried out according to the actual situation, it is easy to cause the separation of production and sales, or blind exchanges, which deserves serious attention.

IV. To hold a good material exchange conference, ideological, organizational, and business preparations must be done in advance. Without these preparations, it will be chaotic and disorganized, and the task of the conference cannot be completed smoothly. The ideological preparation among cadres is mainly to unify the understanding of policies; the organizational preparation is mainly to unify the steps of various units under the leadership of the party committee and draw a certain number of cadres to personally grasp this work; the business preparation is to do a good job in investigation and research, and to make business plans and material strength preparations according to the production and sales situation and economic requirements, so that the exchange conference can complete its mission in an organized, planned, and led manner.

V. Carrying out cultural and entertainment activities at the primary market material exchange conference is an important method to expand exchanges, revitalize the market, and educate the masses. Primary market exchange conferences should widely carry out various cultural and entertainment propaganda activities, and further combine them with the current central work to educate the masses. However, attention must be paid to preventing extravagance and waste.

Zeng Shan put forward several opinions and hopes for the future urban and rural exchange work in the East China region. He said: This year, urban industrial production and handicraft production have developed greatly, preparing material strength for the autumn harvest season. Agricultural production such as wheat, rapeseed, silkworm cocoons, tea, hemp skin, and early rice have all had bumper harvests and are on the market. Autumn grain late rice, cotton, tobacco leaves, raw rice, etc. are also expected to have bumper harvests. This requires large-scale urban and rural material exchanges to be launched in the autumn harvest season to meet the needs of rural and urban production. Another situation is that private industry and commerce have begun to be active. Due to the vast market and the increase in the purchasing power of urban and rural people, the market activity in the second half of the year is expected to exceed that of last year. Therefore, it is necessary to widely hold various types of exchange conferences under leadership and to lead the market in a planned and organized manner to expand material exchanges. This will become the central task of people's governments at all levels, especially financial and economic departments at all levels, in the second half of this year.

I. Taking the autumn harvest as the center, widely hold urban and rural material exchange conferences. Advanced and intermediate market exchange conferences should be opened as early as possible to prepare for the introduction of industrial products into the countryside; primary market exchange conferences should be held with reference to the listing of agricultural products and the gaps in the production season in various places; under the principle of mutual response and mutual cooperation from top to bottom, the material exchange conferences should be widely implemented into the grassroots market. The party committees and people's governments above the special zone level should study and formulate plans on how to combine with each other in the region and respond to each other from top to bottom.

II. Exchange policy: Combine the work of purchasing autumn harvest agricultural products and selling local specialties, and at the same time carry out the supply and sales of industrial products and handicrafts, and closely combine the two. This is the general exchange policy. In the supply and sales of industrial products and handicrafts, in addition to a few hot-selling products and planned materials, the policy of wholesale as the main and large-volume sales should be implemented to meet the needs of the market after the bumper harvest, and the level of industrial and handicraft production should be improved through large-volume sales. When purchasing agricultural products and local specialties, under the principle of completing the state's purchasing plan to ensure the needs of industrial raw materials and export materials, private enterprises should be actively encouraged to operate legitimately to meet the selling requirements of farmers. Increasing the purchasing power of farmers creates conditions for the large-volume sales of industrial products, which opens up a path for the entire urban and rural economic activity.

III. Do a good job in various preparations: (A) Summarize the experience of exchange conferences and educate cadres in a planned way. The financial and economic committees and economic work leading departments in various places should select different types of exchange conferences for summary, and according to the problems existing in the thinking of cadres, use the facts in the exchange conferences, combined with the entire social and economic situation and development direction, to conduct policy education to improve understanding and lay the foundation for holding good exchange conferences in the future. This work should be done well in various places in August and September. (B) To clearly understand the production and sales situation, the market situation, and the goods needed by the masses, under the leadership of the party committees and people's governments in various places, organize relevant administrative and business units to conduct investigation and research on primary, intermediate, and even advanced markets, and formulate exchange plans and programs. (C) Relevant departments should conduct policy inspections, improve work, and correct the shortcomings in the implementation of policies. The trade department should pay attention to adjusting regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences, and study and improve market management work, revise or abolish the industrial and commercial management and market management methods that are not suitable for the current needs, and prohibit illegal and undisciplined behavior of self-defining articles and managing beyond authority without the approval of higher authorities. Cooperatives should do a good job in serving members under the principle of obeying the national plan, and the operation of the free market should implement the state's price policy and overcome the idea of monopolizing in purchasing and supply. The tax department should conscientiously implement the correct tax policy and overcome the ideological style of being too high or too low and disregarding the policy. The loan work of the People's Bank should revolve around urban and rural exchanges, and should establish close contact with industrial and commercial and trade departments to prevent private merchants from speculating due to blind loans, or failing to lend when they should, which hinders material exchanges. The transportation department should strengthen the spirit of service, rationally organize transportation, and promote the development of transportation tools and undertakings to facilitate the strengthening of material circulation and ensure the completion of transportation tasks on schedule.

IV. Strengthen the combination of production and sales and guide production through material exchanges. After the exchange conference, according to the principle of adapting production and sales, various places should instruct relevant departments to strengthen production guidance work in a planned manner to overcome production and sales contradictions; at the same time, guide industries with no development prospects to gradually change careers to achieve the purpose of guiding production and guiding operation.

V. Pay attention to the performance of the contract. Through various exchange conferences, the contracts signed in the first half of the year's exchange conference should be fully inspected, and attention should be paid to summarizing experience to guide new exchanges.

    华东区上半年城乡物资交流工作总结
    （在华东贸易等五部门职工代表联席会议上的报告摘要）
    曾山
    编者按：今年以来，全国各地召开了各种形式的物资交流会议，这些会议取得了很大的成绩，但也或多或少地存在着一些缺点和问题。华东军政委员会曾山副主席在这个报告中提出的意见，解决了物资交流会议中的许多带有普遍性的问题，可供各地参考。
    华东军政委员会副主席曾山在华东国营贸易、金融、交通、税务、合作五部门职工代表联席会议上，对华东区今年上半年的城乡物资交流工作做了总结。曾山指出：今年上半年华东区的城乡物资交流工作，已经取得了很大的成绩。今年上半年很多物资交流大会都是在省、专区和县的负责同志亲自领导或直接掌握下召开的。通过交流大会，活跃了市场，解决了工农业生产的困难；迅速改变了“三反”、“五反”运动后的市场呆滞情况；贯彻了人民政府鼓励私营企业正当经营的政策；维持与发展了工农业生产，并沟通了产销情况，加强了生产的指导，改变了经营的方向。
    曾山指出：华东区城乡物资交流工作，还存在着若干缺点。
    一、部分干部的政策思想不明确，对上级指示的城乡交流的重要意义体会不够深刻。首先，他们认为城乡交流主要是解决淡季困难和滞销商品问题，未能深刻体会城乡交流是新民主主义商业活动的重要形式；城乡交流的作用，是通过物资交流来联系产销，解决产销矛盾；并能推动产销，使分散的自流市场，成为比较有组织有领导的市场。因此不但淡季要开，旺季亦要召开。其次，某些干部对私营工商业政策的认识还存在着“宁左勿右”“宁紧勿宽”，和认为交流大会是单纯照顾私营工商业的两种偏向。前者是没有认识到私营工商业在目前新民主主义经济建设中的一定作用；后者是无原则照顾与单纯迁就思想，这样就会使私商发生依赖思想，甚至投机取巧，这是与鼓励私商正当经营的政策要求不相符合的。
    二、各有关经济部门对于“城乡交流工作”应当成为共同任务的思想不够明确，未能很好地密切配合，统一步调来进行工作。贸易部门对于有计划的合理调整差价，改进市场管理，过去还注意不够，地区差价与零售批发差价还有不合理之处。某些商品使私商运销无利，妨碍了私营商业的合理利润；在市场管理上是证照繁多，也是不利私商正当经营的。税务机关、银行与交通运输部门也还有不注意或不重视以至某些妨碍物资交流的现象，必须加以改善。
    三、在迅速搞活市场的要求下，个别地区在召开城乡交流大会中存在着任务观点，和开始发生了形式主义、强迫命令、铺张浪费的现象。有些地区不是根据产销情况与当地要求，确定召开交流大会的形式与内容，而是为了完成开交流会的任务而召开大会，因而发生了强迫命令与形式主义。这样做法是有害的，应该严格纠正与防止。
    四、缺乏调查研究，产销情况了解不够，甚至有盲目交流，追求成交数字，向国营公司合作社和私商派任务的情况。此外，有些干部对从城乡交流进一步发展到内外交流注意不够，没有很好发挥有经营能力的进出口商的积极性，致使国内部分土特产可以输出而未能及时输出。这是在今后交流大会中应该引起注意的。
    曾山谈到华东区城乡物资交流工作中的几点体会时说：
    一、城乡物资交流大会，是国营经济领导下发挥私商积极性的一种最好方式，也是新民主主义商业活动中的良好形式。它是联系生产与消费的重要环节，不仅可以解决淡季困难，活跃市场，而且有着深刻地指导生产和保证有计划生产的作用。通过物资交流大会可以沟通产销情况，使生产者能按照销路与社会需要，改进和扩大生产。同时，可以通过交流会来有计划的领导私营工商业者，发挥私商有利于国计民生的经营积极性。
    二、要按照不同市场不同情况召开不同形式的交流会议，并应注意上下呼应，互相推动，以发挥更大效果。根据过去经验，交流会不能盲目召开，必须按照不同市场经济情况，和生产季节的间隙，来召开不同形式的交流会议，一般说有高级、中级、初级三种市场形式的交流大会。甲、高级市场交流形式（如华东区城乡物资交流大会）：其特点是以大宗批发为主，以国营公司为主体，结合合作社，团结广大工商业者进行直接交流。经过这样的大会，能扩大大宗物资的交流，解决不同地区的生产与消费的需要。因此，高级市场交流会应在生产淡季与消费旺季到来以前，有计划有准备的召开。此种会议的成交数量较大，直接影响社会生产与消费需要，因此必须加强交流的计划性，防止在生产淡季中交流过大，影响旺季全面供应或盲目生产，在销售旺季交流中防止盲目成交和投机囤积的情况。同时必须注意领导和检查合同的履行，保证交易合同的贯彻。乙、中级市场交流形式（如各省中等城市所召开的带有地区性的交流会议）：此种交流会议性质与高级市场交流大会相同，只是地区范围稍小于高级市场而已。但参加交流的代表，更应深入和普遍动员，并应适应县、镇分散和经营能力不大的特点，尽量组织近途交流和小额成交，并可与零售业务相结合，为初级市场做好准备。但会议时间不应过长，不应订立过多的长期合同，因此，此种会议次数可稍多于高级的交流大会，在高级市场交流会议前后均可召开。丙、初级市场交流形式：1、以面向群众的零售业务为主，而又是土特产贩运商、工业品和手工业品零售商与农民直接交易的集会形式。时间不宜过长。业务方针应适合农民的要求，实行愿买愿卖的购销原则。如丹阳、访仙区及嘉兴的交流大会即是成功典型。2、在旧有庙会、山会、骡马大会、药材大会、赶墟赶集等旧有形式上，加以组织领导，使其进一步发挥便利农民交流产品的作用。3、交流会议的业务工作应以合作社为领导，并可由国营公司临时派出收购或推销小组，以活泼市场，并发挥领导私商的作用。4、大会内容应以收购推销为主，结合文娱宣传教育工作，收购推销是便利农民，文娱宣传是为了活跃市场教育农民。
    三、加强调查研究，了解与掌握产销情况，防止物资交流的盲目性，加强计划性，才能进一步发挥物资交流大会的作用。今年各地的物资交流大会已经注意到了克服盲目性，加强计划性，大家签订合同时都很慎重，签订合同之后都能认真执行。但由于我国地区广大，生产分散，产销情况容易变化，签订合同前要慎重考虑，确有把握者才签约，如果不能根据实际情况进行交流，则容易造成产销脱节，或盲目交流，这是值得严重注意的。
    四、要开好物资交流大会，必须事先做好思想上的、组织上的及业务上的准备工作。没有这些准备，就会杂乱无章，工作混乱，不能顺利完成大会任务。干部中的思想准备主要是统一政策的认识；组织准备主要是在党委领导下统一各单位的步调，并抽调一定的干部来亲自掌握这一工作；业务准备即是做好调查研究，根据产销情况及经济要求，做好业务计划，及物资力量的准备，使交流大会在有组织、有计划、有领导的情况下完成它的使命。
    五、在初级市场物资交流会议上开展文化娱乐活动，是扩大交流，活跃市场，教育群众的重要方法。初级市场交流会议，应该广泛地开展各种文娱宣传活动，并进一步结合目前中心工作，以教育群众。但必须注意防止铺张浪费。
    曾山对华东区今后城乡交流工作提出几点意见和希望，他说：今年城市工业生产与手工业生产均有很大发展，给秋收旺季准备了物资力量。农业生产中小麦、菜籽、蚕茧、茶叶、麻皮及早稻均已丰收上市，秋粮晚稻、棉花、烟叶、生米等亦丰收在望，这样就须要在秋收旺季里大规模的展开城乡物资交流，以满足农村及城市生产的需要。另一情况是私营工商业已开始活跃，由于市场的广阔，和城乡人民购买力的提高，下半年市场活跃预期是会超过去年的。因此必须有领导地广泛地召开各种类型的交流会，有计划、有组织地来领导市场，扩大物资交流，这将成为今年下半年各级人民政府尤其是各级财经部门的中心工作任务。
    一、以秋收为中心，广泛地召开城乡物资交流大会。高级与中级市场交流会应尽量先开，以做好工业品下乡的准备；初级市场交流会应参照各地农产品上市情况及生产季节的间隙召开；在上下呼应，相互配合的原则下，广泛地把物资交流会贯彻到基层市场中去。各地在地区上如何相互结合，上下呼应，各专区以上党委与人民政府，应加研究订出计划。
    二、交流方针：结合秋收农产品收购和土特产推销工作，同时开展工业品及手工业品的供应与推销，并使二者密切结合，这是总的交流方针。在工业品及手工业品的供应与推销中，除少数热销品和计划物资外，均应贯彻批发为主、大量推销的方针，以满足丰收后的市场需要，并经过大量推销来提高工业与手工业生产的水平。收购农产品及土特产时，在完成国家收购计划，以保证工业原料及出口物资需要的原则下，应积极鼓励私营企业的正当经营，以满足农民出售的要求。提高农民的购买力，为大量推销工业品创造条件，亦即为整个城乡经济活跃开辟道路。
    三、做好各项准备工作：（甲）总结交流大会的经验，有计划地教育干部。各地财政经济委员会及经济工作领导部门，应选择不同类型交流会进行总结，并根据干部思想上存在的问题，用交流会中的事实，结合整个社会经济情况及发展方向，进行政策教育，以提高认识，打下今后开好交流会的基础，这一工作各地应在八、九月份做好。（乙）要做到清楚地了解产销情况、市场情况和群众需要的商品情况，在各地党委和人民政府领导下，组织有关行政和企业单位，分别对初级、中级以至高级市场进行调查研究，并制订交流计划与方案。（丙）各有关部门应进行政策检查，改进工作，纠正执行政策中存在的缺点。贸易部门要注意调整地区差价与批发零售差价，并研究和改进市场管理工作，修改或取消不适合目前需要的工商管理与市场管理的办法，禁止不经上级批准自订条文、越权管理的违法乱纪行为。合作社应在服从国家计划原则下做好为社员服务工作，对自由市场的经营要执行国家价格政策，在收购供应中克服包办思想。税务部门要认真贯彻正确的税务政策，要克服偏高偏低以及不顾政策的思想作风。人民银行的贷款工作要围绕城乡交流进行，并要与工商、贸易部门取得密切联系，防止盲目贷款引起私商投机，或该贷不贷而妨碍物资交流的情况。交通运输部门要加强服务精神，合理组织运输，促进运输工具和事业发展，以利加强物资流转，保证运输任务如期完成。
    四、通过物资交流加强产销结合和指导生产的工作。各地应在交流大会之后，按产销适应的原则，责成有关部门，有计划地加强生产指导工作，克服产销矛盾；同时引导无发展前途的行业逐步进行转业，以实现指导生产和指导经营的目的。
    五、注意合同的履行。要通过各种交流会议，把上半年交流大会中所签订的合同进行全面检查，并注意总结经验指导新的交流。
