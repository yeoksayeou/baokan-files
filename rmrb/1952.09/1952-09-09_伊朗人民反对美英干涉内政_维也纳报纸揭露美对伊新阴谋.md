Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: TASS, Tehran, September 5th: The Iranian people firmly oppose Truman and Churchill's joint letter to Mossadegh attempting to jointly interfere with Iran's oil nationalization.

The "National Association for the Struggle Against Imperialism of Iran" issued a statement pointing out that Truman and Churchill's joint letter is "a document that clearly proves the intentions of British and American colonialism and reveals their true plans." The statement said: "They want to nullify the Iranian people's decades of struggle." The statement called on the Iranian people to "strengthen their resistance every day and immediately participate in the united front to fight against the colonialists."

The "Witness Daily" published an editorial on Truman and Churchill's joint letter, saying: "The master of the American White House has failed to understand what happened in China yesterday, what is happening in the Middle East today, and what will happen everywhere tomorrow... They instructed their ambassador to Iran, Henderson, to use ten million dollars to buy off Iranian farmers for them. They have used hundreds of millions of dollars to buy off Greece and Turkey, and they thought they could do the same in Iran." The "Witness Daily" continued: "We ask Henderson to inform his master Truman that Iran, this backward little village, cannot be bought with the 23 million dollars, 10 million dollars, hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in Truman's Point Four Program. We will decide our own lives and the fate of our resources."

Xinhua News Agency, September 7th: TASS, Vienna, September 4th: The "Evening News" published a dispatch from London saying that the report submitted by British Ambassador to Washington Franks regarding the informal talks between former Iranian Minister of the Army Bina and American representatives has greatly attracted the attention of political figures in the British capital. This report believes that the concentration of troops by the United States in the border areas of Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan indicates that the US government intends to use force to change the political situation in order to maintain its interests in Iran.

In this regard, Franks pointed out that the United States apparently wants to use the same means in Iran as Colonel Shishekli used in Syria and General Naguib used in Egypt.

Former Iranian Minister of the Army Bina formed a political group with several former Iranian army officers, including Zahedi, Hakimi, and Sayyed Zia'eddin. This group has the support of the King. In addition, Bina has supporters among officers of various arms of the military and among several tribal chiefs in southern Iran. He also receives considerable funds from American institutions.

    伊朗人民反对美英干涉内政
    维也纳报纸揭露美对伊新阴谋
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社德黑兰五日讯：伊朗人民坚决反对杜鲁门和邱吉尔在给摩萨台的联名信中企图共同干涉伊朗实行石油国有化。
    “伊朗全国反帝国主义斗争协会”发表声明，指出杜鲁门和邱吉尔的联名信是“清晰地证明了英美两国殖民主义的意图并显露它们的真正计划的一个文件”。声明说：“它们要使伊朗人民几十年来的斗争化为泡影。”声明号召伊朗人民“每天加强他们的反抗，立即参加为反对殖民主义者而斗争的统一战线”。
    “见证报”就杜鲁门和邱吉尔的联名信发表社论说：“美国白宫主人未能了解中国昨天所发生的情况，中东今天所发生的情况以及各地明天将要发生的情况……他们训令他们派驻伊朗的韩德逊大使以一千万美元来为他们收买伊朗的农民。他们曾以几亿美元收买过希腊和土耳其，并且以为他们在伊朗同样可以办得到。”“见证报”接着写道：“我们要求韩德逊去通知他的主子杜鲁门：伊朗这个落后的小乡村，不是用杜鲁门第四点计划中二千三百万美元，一千万美元，几亿或是几十亿美元所可以买得到的。我们自己会决定我们的生活以及我们的资源的命运。”
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社维也纳四日讯：“晚报”刊载伦敦的电讯说：英国驻华盛顿大使佛朗克斯所提出的关于前伊朗陆军大臣比纳和美国代表进行非正式会谈的报告，大大引起了英国首都政界人士的注意。这个报告认为，美国在伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦的边境地区内集中兵力，表明美国政府打算用武力改变政治局势，以便维持它在伊朗的利益。
    关于这方面，佛朗克斯指出：美国显然要在伊朗使用像施舍赫里上校在叙利亚和纳吉布将军在埃及使用过的手段。
    前伊朗陆军大臣比纳把若干前伊朗陆军军官组成一个政治集团，其中有萨希迪、哈基米还有赛齐雅·艾丁。这个集团得到国王的支持。此外，比纳在各兵种军官中间，在伊朗南部若干酋长中间都有支持他的人。他还从美国机构得到相当多的款项。
