Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th: Brussels dispatch: The Secretariat of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, in a statement dated August 30th sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, solemnly condemned the U.S. for refusing to repatriate prisoners of war, delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, and slaughtering prisoners of war and civilians. The statement said: The Secretariat of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers believes that the U.S. authorities, acting under the guise of the United Nations, have no legal basis whatsoever for claiming the right to refuse to repatriate Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to their homelands. The actions of the U.S. authorities in obstructing the armistice negotiations are inexcusable, and they should bear the responsibility for the continued war in Korea. The statement condemned the U.S. military's massacre of large numbers of prisoners of war on Koje Island and advocated punishing all those who committed such massacres.
The statement concluded: The actions of the U.S. military in the Korean War, including bacteriological warfare, the use of napalm bombs, the bombing of undefended cities and civilians, and many other atrocities, constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity and should be tried by an international tribunal.

    谴责美方拖延谈判和屠杀战俘等罪行
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】布鲁塞尔消息：国际民主法律工作者协会秘书处在八月三十日以声明一件送给联合国秘书长，严正谴责美方拒绝遣返战俘、拖延朝鲜停战谈判、屠杀战俘与平民等行为。声明说：国际民主法律工作者协会秘书处认为：假借联合国名义行事的美国当局所谓有权拒绝遣返朝中战俘回国的说法，是毫无法律根据的。美国当局阻挠了停战谈判的行为是不可宽恕的，他们应担负在朝鲜继续进行战争的责任。声明谴责美军在巨济岛屠杀大批战俘的行为，并主张惩处所有犯有此种屠杀罪行的人们。
    声明最后说：美国军队在朝鲜战争中的行为，其中包括细菌战、使用凝固汽油弹、轰击不设防城市和平民以及其他许多暴行，构成了战争罪行和违反人道罪行，应受到国际法庭的审判。
