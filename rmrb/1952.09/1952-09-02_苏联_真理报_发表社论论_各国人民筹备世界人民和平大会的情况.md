Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 30th: The "Pravda" published an editorial on the 30th, commenting on the preparations of people from all countries for the World People's Peace Congress.

"Pravda" said: In just over three months, the World People's Peace Congress will open. This is a significant event in the lives of peace-loving people of all countries. Large-scale preparations for the World People's Peace Congress are underway in all countries of the world.

The World People's Peace Congress is convened at a time when people of all strata in all countries are increasingly aware of the need to redouble their efforts to smash the conspiracies of the imperialist instigators who are instigating another war.

The US imperialist policy of continuing and expanding the predatory war in Korea, the arms expansion movement carried out by the aggressive Atlantic bloc countries, the revival of aggressive and revanchist forces in West Germany and Japan, the use of bacteriological weapons in Korea, the stubborn refusal of the American ruling clique to condemn and prohibit bacteriological and atomic weapons and other inhumane weapons of war—all this clearly points out to the peace-loving people of all countries the extreme importance of intensifying the struggle for peace.

More and more people in countries around the world have realized that the struggle for peace, the struggle against the threat of war, is the most urgent task for all progressive humanity today.

"Pravda" quoted a recent letter from Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council, to the peace committees of various countries, as well as the declaration issued by the World Peace Council for the convening of the World People's Peace Congress. Both the letter and the declaration pointed out that the people of all countries are increasingly determined to avoid the danger of another war.

"Pravda" continued: News of the launch of preparations for the World People's Peace Congress is pouring in from various countries. The World Peace Council's declaration calling for a peaceful resolution to the German question, intensifying the struggle against Japanese re-militarization and striving to establish a democratic Japan, stopping the Korean War, banning bacteriological weapons, and concluding a peace pact has won warm support from the masses of people all over the world.

Millions of men and women who care about the fate of peace are united around this democratic program of safeguarding peace. When explaining the decisions of the World Peace Council to the masses, the peace fighters against the threat of another war have found ways to establish close ties with people of all strata who have always stood on the side of actively striving for peace, as well as leaders in political, social, cultural, and religious fields. In doing so, peace advocates have expressed their willingness to discuss all proposals aimed at achieving peace, security, and national independence for the people of all countries.

Today, large and small gatherings are being held in many countries, and preparations are underway to convene local peace conferences and national peace congresses. With the assistance of trade unions, many countries have organized workers' peace conferences, as well as farmers' conferences, where participants are discussing the issue of maintaining peace and other specific issues related to them.

Peace advocates in France, Italy, China, Britain, Germany, Japan, India, Brazil, and other countries are holding mass discussions and opinion polls, during which they have put forward common views on maintaining peace. These gatherings have become forums for people from all walks of life, with different opinions and tendencies, and from various organizations and groups to exchange views widely. Instructions to the delegates attending the World People's Peace Congress were adopted at the meetings. An important part of the preparations for the World People's Peace Congress is the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in September; preparations for this conference have been widely launched in Asian, Far Eastern, and Pacific countries. The people of Asian countries resolutely demand that the United States stop armed intervention in Korea and indignantly condemn bacteriological warfare, the barbaric bombing of peaceful towns in Korea and China, and other atrocities by the US military.

A feature of the congress preparations is that millions of sincere people have become increasingly active. During the preparation work, the existing peace committee organizations have been strengthened, and many new peace committees have been established in various places.

However, peace advocates realize that all the work they have done for the congress is only a beginning, only some preliminary work. "Pravda" emphasized: The current task is to involve the broadest masses of people in the preparations for the congress, and to introduce everything about this congress to men and women around the world.

Peace advocates have accumulated a lot of experience in the mass work of preparing for previous world peace congresses, and in the world-scale mass movement to collect signatures for peace declarations. To make full use of this experience and to publicize the decisions of the special meeting of the World Peace Council on a broader scale, using all available means of written and oral propaganda and agitation for this purpose, holding mass rallies in various places, conducting door-to-door propaganda, convening national and regional peace conferences, and involving various trade unions, cultural and religious organizations and their leaders in the struggle for peace - all of the above are the practical tasks of peace advocates in various countries. Whether the congress can succeed depends primarily on whether the preparations have been launched on the broadest scale.

In the Soviet Union, the preparations for the World People's Peace Congress are taking place during a significant period. The news of the convening of the 19th Party Congress has spread all over the world. The published instructions of the 19th Party Congress have once again shown the people of all countries the outstanding expression of the Soviet Union's consistent peace-loving policy. The Soviet people, staunch fighters for peace, are working with greater enthusiasm to strengthen their socialist motherland—the bulwark of world peace—during the preparations for the 19th Party Congress.

"Pravda" concluded by saying: The great example of the Soviet people, standing at the forefront of the cause of defending peace and international security and marching forward, inspires hundreds of millions of honest people in all countries of the world, enabling them to wage a more resolute and organized struggle against imperialist aggressors and war-mongers in order to safeguard and consolidate world peace.

    苏联“真理报”发表社论论
    各国人民筹备世界人民和平大会的情况
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科八月三十日电：“真理报”于三十日发表社论，评论各国人民筹备世界人民和平大会的情况。
    “真理报”说：还有三个多月世界人民和平大会就要开幕了。这是爱好和平的各国人民生活中意义重大的事件。世界人民和平大会的大规模筹备工作，正在世界各国进行中。
    召开世界人民和平大会的时候，正是各国各阶层人民越来越认识到必须加倍努力来摧毁鼓动另一次战争的帝国主义挑拨者的阴谋的时候。
    美帝国主义所实行的继续进行并扩大在朝鲜的掠夺战争的政策，侵略性大西洋集团国家所进行的扩张军备运动，西德和日本的侵略和复仇的势力的复活，细菌武器在朝鲜的使用，美国统治集团的顽固拒绝谴责和禁止细菌武器和原子武器及其他不人道的战争武器——所有这一切都明白地向爱好和平的各国人民指出了加紧进行和平斗争的极端重要性。
    世界各国已有越来越多的人民认识到：争取和平的斗争，反对战争威胁的斗争，是全体进步人类当前最紧要的任务。
    “真理报”引述了世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里最近致各国和平委员会的一封信以及世界和平理事会为召开世界人民和平大会所发表的宣言，这封信和宣言都指出了各国人民越来越坚决要避免另一次战争的危险。
    “真理报”继续写道：各国展开世界人民和平大会筹备工作的消息纷纷传来。世界和平理事会要求和平解决德国问题、加紧反对日本重新军国主义化和争取建立民主日本的斗争、停止朝鲜战争、禁止细菌武器并缔结和平公约的宣言，获得了全世界各地的人民群众的热烈拥护。
    关心和平命运的千百万男女都团结在这个维护和平的民主纲领的周围。反对另一次战争的威胁的和平战士们，在向群众解释世界和平理事会的决定的时候，就找出了和那些一直站在积极争取和平这一边的各阶层人民以及政治、社会、文化和宗教各方面的领袖们建立密切联系的途径。和平拥护者在这么做的时候都表示：他们愿意讨论凡是目的在于获致各国人民的和平、安全及民族独立的一切建议。
    今天许多国家都在举行大小集会，并且正在进行筹备召开各地和平会议和各国和平大会的工作。许多国家在工会的协助下已经组织了工人争取和平的会议，同时也组织了农民会议，会议的参加者正在讨论维护和平的问题以及对他们有关的其他具体问题。
    法国、意大利、中国、英国、德国、日本、印度、巴西和其他国家的和平拥护者正在举行群众讨论会和民意测验，大家在讨论会和测验中间，纷纷提出了维护和平的共同意见。这种种集会已经成为各行各业、抱有各种不同见解和倾向以及各种组织和团体的人民广泛交换意见的讲坛。会议上通过了给参加世界人民和平大会的代表的指示。在世界人民和平大会的筹备工作中一个重要的环节是将于九月间在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议；这个会议的筹备工作已在亚洲、远东和太平洋各国广泛展开。亚洲各国人民坚决要求美国停止武装干涉朝鲜，并且愤慨地谴责细菌战、谴责向朝鲜和中国和平城镇进行野蛮轰炸和美军的其他暴行。
    大会筹备工作中的一个特征是：千百万怀有诚意的人民已经日益活跃起来。在筹备工作期间，现有的和平委员会的组织已经加强，各地并且新成立了许多和平委员会。
    但是和平拥护者都认识到：他们为大会所作的一切工作仅仅是一个开始，仅仅是一些初步工作。“真理报”着重指出：当前的任务是使最广泛的人民群众参加大会的筹备工作，向全世界各地男女介绍这次大会的一切情况。
    和平拥护者在筹备前几次世界和平大会的群众工作中，在为和平宣言征集签名的世界规模的群众运动中，已经积累了许多经验。充分利用这些经验，在更加广泛的规模上宣传世界和平理事会特别会议的决定，为了实现这个目的使用一切可以利用的文字和口头的宣传鼓动的工具，在各地举行群众大会，进行逐户宣传，召开各国和各个区域的和平会议，使各个工会、文化和宗教组织及其领袖参加争取和平的斗争——以上这一切都是各国的和平拥护者的实际任务。大会是否能够成功首先要看筹备工作是否已在最广泛的规模上展开。
    在苏联，世界人民和平大会的筹备工作正在重大的时日中进行。召开第十九次党代表大会的消息已经传遍全世界。已经公布的第十九次党代表大会的指示，使世界各国人民再一次看到了苏联一贯的爱好和平政策的卓越的表现。苏联人民，争取和平的坚强战士，在筹备召开第十九次党代表大会的期间，正以更大的热情努力工作以加强他们的社会主义祖国——世界和平的堡垒的力量。
    “真理报”结语说：站在保卫和平和国际安全事业的各国人民前列向前挺进的苏联人民的伟大范例，鼓舞了全世界各国亿万正直人民，使他们为了维护和巩固世界和平而向帝国主义侵略者和战争制造者进行更坚决更有组织的斗争。
