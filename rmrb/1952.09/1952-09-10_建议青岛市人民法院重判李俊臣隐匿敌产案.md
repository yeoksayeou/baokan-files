    Suggesting Qingdao Municipal People's Court to Heavily Sentence Li Junchen in the Case of Concealing Enemy Property
    Editor: The Qingdao Municipal People's Court has wrongly handled a case.
    The matter is as follows: In 1942, Chen Yufeng, a citizen of Qingdao, sold a property located at 73-81 Taishan Road in the city to a Japanese person named Qi Qi through the introduction of Sun Jing San and others, who then rented it to Chinese tenants. After the Japanese surrender, in January 1948, real estate agent Li Junchen attempted to drive away the residents in order to achieve his goal of concealing enemy property. Li forced the residents to pay housing deposits, and when they were unable to do so, Li instigated the second landlord, Liang Xiangshan, a Qingdao rogue, and scattered soldiers of the Kuomintang bandit army officer Zhang Tianzuo to drive the residents out onto the streets, where they slept for fourteen days. Several women and children were frightened and became ill, and six of them died one after another. After numerous mediations, the residents were able to move back. Afterwards, the residents sent representatives to the puppet court to appeal, but of course, the puppet court would not stand up for the people. As a result, Li Junchen was found "not guilty." During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1951, the masses exposed Li Junchen's crimes of concealing enemy property and oppressing the people, but after a long trial by the Qingdao Municipal People's Court, he was still found "not guilty." In this case, the Qingdao Municipal People's Court conducted the trial and made its judgment based on the verdict of the puppet court, without any changes. Zhang Zhongyi (retained personnel), the trial judge in the case, said: "In Qingdao, it is customary for housing to have a landlord and a second landlord; the residents have direct dealings with the second landlord and have nothing to do with the landlord. This case has little to do with Li Junchen, so he was found not guilty." I believe that this practice is seriously harmful to the interests of the people and cannot be tolerated. I suggest that the Qingdao Municipal People's Court conduct a detailed investigation of the case and make a correct decision.

### 建议青岛市人民法院重判李俊臣隐匿敌产案

    建议青岛市人民法院重判李俊臣隐匿敌产案
    编辑同志：青岛市人民法院错误地处理了一个案件。
    事情是这样的：一九四二年，青岛市市民陈玉丰，把该市泰山路七十三号至八十一号房产一所，经孙景三等介绍卖给日本人齐其，再出租给中国房客居住。日本投降后，一九四八年一月，房地产经纪人李俊臣企图赶走住户，以达到他隐匿敌产的目的。李逼迫住户缴纳住房押金，住户无力交付，李即唆使二房主青岛市流氓梁相山及国民党匪军军官张天佐的散兵把住户驱至街头露宿了十四天。若干妇孺受惊成病，先后死亡六人。经过多次调解，住户才得迁回。事后，住户们推代表到伪法院申诉，当然伪法院是不会给人民作主的，结果判李俊臣“无罪”。一九五一年镇压反革命运动中，群众揭发李俊臣隐匿敌产、欺压人民的罪行，但青岛市人民法院经长期审讯，结果仍然判李“无罪”。对于这一案件，青岛市人民法院是在伪法院的判决基础上，原封不动地进行审讯、判决的。该案审判员张仲义（留用人员）曾说：“在青岛市，住房之有房主和二房主是惯例；住户直接和二房主发生关系，和房主是没有关系的。该案和李俊臣的关系不大，所以判处李无罪。”我认为这种做法，是严重危害人民利益的，是不能容许的。建议青岛市人民法院对该案进行详细了解并作正确处理。
