    Impressions of New China and a Glimpse of Siberia
    By Kingsbury
    On the morning of June 26, 1952, the sky was clear and bright. At sunrise, I left Beijing for Moscow, a memorable flight. As the plane rapidly ascended from the airport, I looked down and saw the increasingly smaller Summer Palace outside Beijing. The lovely lake and lotus flowers were so enchanting—previously a resort exclusively enjoyed by Chinese emperors, it has now become an unparalleled museum and a magnificent playground for the Chinese people. This was a rare and unforgettable glimpse for me. We flew over the mountains surrounding Beijing towards the Gobi Desert. The historically significant Great Wall of China left an indelible impression on my memory. It stretched endlessly along the mountain ridges, standing atop the crescent-shaped barrier, protecting Beijing from "barbarian" invasions for centuries.
    I had to get up before dawn to catch the plane leaving Beijing. I really wanted to say I didn't want to get up so early, but there are advantages to getting up early. Less than half an hour after takeoff, we could see the Great Wall extending from east to west. Only in this wonderful moment, flying at 2,000 feet, with the rising sun behind us, could I see this impressive and glorious view, this unforgettable spectacle—the ramparts and watchtowers of the Great Wall of China illuminated by the yellow sunlight after such a dawn.
    Even for an old lawyer like myself, the journey to Moscow was consistently inspiring. Flying over 600 miles of the Gobi Desert, stopping in oases, being with friendly Mongolians, watching camels chewing on small bundles of grass, or picking up various strange stones and putting them in my pocket to bring back for geological research, then flying over thousands of miles of Siberia, with its towering mountains, beautiful Lake Baikal and other small lakes; huge and winding rivers—the Yenisei River, the Ob River and its tributaries; vast plains and grasslands dotted with state farms and collective farms; and many villages and important industrial centers—Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Sverdlovsk—everywhere truly free men and women were busy building a new civilization. These couldn't help but remind me of Oregon and Washington, the two states where I grew up in the early part of this century, and the lives of the pioneers there, but with a clear difference: the United States did not yet understand that in order to build a civilization on a solid foundation, hospitals and sanatoriums, sports fields, stadiums, cultural recreation parks, schools and institutions of higher education must be developed simultaneously with industry and agriculture; and this way of social life can be seen throughout the Soviet Union, including in the vast Siberian wilderness seen from the air or observed during overnight stops on the three-day flight from Beijing to Moscow, both in factories and in rural areas.
    Leaving Beijing after a month's visit to New China, it takes time to reflect. What I saw and heard in China was like a dream, otherwise one would think he had arrived in a new world. The scenery and life in China complement each other, which is really fascinating, especially when you fly from Beijing to Hankou, or take a boat up the Yangtze River to Shashi; fly from Wuhan to Shanghai, or take a comfortable train from Shanghai to Hangzhou. The enchanting West Lake is covered with lotus flowers, surrounded by mythical mountains, like a fairyland. No wonder wealthy officials used to build magnificent mansions by West Lake to receive the emperors of China. Flying over Siberia, China leaped into my mind like a dream, and the differences between the two places were so vivid. The scenery and life are different, but the friendly people of these two neighboring countries each have their intoxicating aspects.
    I quietly pondered the Great Wall, this huge project completed in the third century BC with slave labor over decades. Then I quietly pondered the many new Great Walls being built by free men and women in China today. Hundreds of thousands of them consciously and willingly rose up to build barriers to resist the natural disasters that have submerged China's fertile land and devastated the Chinese people for centuries. Under the leadership of Mao Zedong, these fearless people are building barriers to prevent floods, droughts, famines and diseases. In less than three years after liberation, some great flood control projects, dikes, dams, and sluice gates have been completed. These are the great Great Walls of peaceful construction, controlling and storing the waters of the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and the Yellow River, using their hydropower to generate electricity, using them for irrigation, and using them to improve and expand cheap transportation. Upstream of these great rivers, and along the banks of all major and minor rivers across the country, millions of seedlings cultivated in state-owned farms are being planted to form a new "forest Great Wall," a Great Wall of prevention, a barrier against humanity's great natural enemy—erosion. However, New China's great afforestation plan is not limited to the upper reaches of the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and the Yellow River, nor is it limited to water storage and flood control. The plan includes planting hundreds of miles of forests to change the climate and the entire face of China. The greatest project is the Northwest Shelterbelt, which is 3,000 li long and up to 600 li wide in its widest part. All these afforestation projects indeed constitute a veritable new Great Wall, used to protect the people of New China from the dangers of natural enemies. This is a Great Wall built not with bricks and stones, but with forests.
    With the vivid impression of the Great Wall—one of the "Seven Wonders of the World"—in my memory, a Great Wall built more than 2,000 years ago to protect the Chinese people and their country from foreign invasion, it was natural that when I flew over Siberia, I would think back to some of the new Great Walls of China, especially those that I had personally seen being built. I stayed in the Yangtze River basin for six days, and near Shashi, I saw 300,000 male and female volunteer workers gathered like ants on the dikes, dams, and sluice gates, determined to complete the project in 75 days (15 days less than the scheduled 90 days) before the rainy season arrives at the end of July. I said "gathered like ants" because these masses of laborers were as well-organized as ants. They sang as they worked, accomplishing a huge task in record-breaking time, like an anthill being piled up before my eyes.
    As I flew across Asia, some other Great Walls seemed to be still before my eyes: the Great Wall of Liberation, which took 25 years to complete to resist enemies at home and abroad; the Great Wall of land reform, built on the solid foundation of fair distribution of "land to the tillers," which is the key to freedom and democracy in New China. This city began construction as early as when the Great Wall of China began to be built. After continuous anti-feudal struggles, its walls are now rapidly approaching completion, and now these newborn people finally seem to suddenly break through the feudal system like butterflies breaking through their cocoons.
    Grasping this key to understanding the sudden leap of the Chinese people from feudal oppression to the dawn of freedom and democracy, people can understand other Great Walls that are being built to resist the enemies of humanity: prejudice and narrow-mindedness—even past landlords were given a share of land, and their treatment was lenient, provided that their past actions were not extremely evil. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns required people to correct those weaknesses of human nature that were not predestined, but were also deeply rooted, and that were cultivated by the life and habits of imperial China and the "foreign concessions" period for a hundred years, and that were inherited and intensified by Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang regime.
    The "Three-Anti" renovation plan aimed to eliminate New China's three major moral enemies—corruption, waste, and bureaucracy—nationwide. This was a profound and educational movement. The campaign began on January 1, 1952, and ended at the end of June. The method adopted was self-analysis and self-criticism, starting from the ministers at the highest level, and then following the political and social strata in turn, all the way down to the lowest level.
    Similarly, the "Five-Anti" movement, its main targets were industrialists and businessmen and the industrial and commercial circles. It was directed against five evil influences—bribery, theft or concealment of state assets, shoddy workmanship and cutting corners, leaking government secrets for speculation, and tax evasion. Although this movement is still in progress, it is said that significant progress has been made in opposing these bad habits.
    These are some of the new-style Great Walls that New China has built and is building to defend against human and natural enemies, both internal and external. These enemies could endanger the realization of the Common Program and the Organizational Law, which were adopted by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing on September 29, 1949, and approved by all parties and factions comprising the "united front."
    An indispensable condition for peace is that the whole world should know: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference unanimously agrees to take New Democracy, that is, People's Democracy, as the political foundation for the founding of the People's Republic of China."
    After the flight over the Great Wall of China at that exciting sunrise, what I saw in Siberia in three days, and the vivid recollection of those rare opportunities for observation during a month's trip to New China, and the enlightening explanations given to us by rural peasant leaders, teachers, university presidents and professors, farm and factory leaders, and government officials at all levels, from cities, provinces, and the central government; all the things seen and recalled were food for thought, and it takes time to think about these things properly, and three days is not nearly enough, but the almost uninterrupted thinking and careful reading of notes during those three days of flight was invaluable in helping one to correct one's attitude towards the new civilizations of the Soviet Union and China.
    It takes all this time and even more time to sort out my impressions and thoughts and present them to the people who belong to a relatively older civilization. We must tell them the truth about what is happening in this new world, because without knowledge and mutual understanding, both civilizations are in grave danger of being destroyed.
    As early as 1926, the great scholar, Professor Herbert Gowen of Oriental Languages at the University of Washington, wrote:
    "We need no great breadth of vision to see that, if the Pacific is to justify its name, if the contact of East and West is to result in the prosperity of both and the enrichment of culture, it must be upon a basis of mutual acquaintance leading to mutual understanding and sympathy. This is the only effective way to avoid conflict, to avoid the destruction of the material and spiritual achievements of mankind, to avoid the utter desolation of the earth.
    "Every Chinese educational institution is studying American institutions. Every Chinese schoolboy can recite the names of the great men of our history. How many of our American schoolboys, college students, or even teachers and professors can name the eminent men of this 'immortal nation,' or give the briefest sketch of the origin, characteristics, and tendencies of this nation?" ("A Short History of China," p. 8, New York, D. Appleton & Co., 1927)
    Unfortunately, the unfortunate situation described by Dr. Gowen in 1926 apparently still exists in 1952. It is terrible that the words written about the old China 25 years ago can still be applied to the new China today with increased emphasis. Dr. Gowen's warning is even more important today: "Mutual understanding and sympathy must be established (between the United States and China). This is the only effective way to avoid conflict"—a conflict with disastrous consequences.
    Therefore, I want to tell my Western compatriots the true stories of everything I saw and heard in the East. I intend to repeat and develop this story faithfully and in detail, hoping to contribute to a clearer understanding of the peaceful construction being carried out in China and the Soviet Union and the remarkable invincibility of the friendship between these two great nations.
    To use the words of Grenville Clark in his bold and thoughtful book, "A Plan for Peace" (Harper & Brothers, 1950), I want to do everything in my power to "encourage a deeper discussion of the meaning of World War III, so that when we understand the shocking moral and material consequences, we will think more wisely about how to establish world order."
    For this purpose, I have recently traveled extensively in the Soviet Union for several weeks. For this purpose, I was invited in May to attend the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference to be held at the end of September. For this purpose, I am helping to encourage representative Americans to travel to China to attend that peace conference to be held in Beijing in September. For this purpose, I am telling my American compatriots about the profound impressions the preparatory meeting gave me, because its organization is democratic; because it is broadly representative, including various nationalities, professions, religions, and political views; and because the forty-seven representatives from twenty countries all have lofty wisdom and sincerity. For this purpose, I also want to constantly tell the people of the West, especially the people of the United States, what I saw, heard, and felt during that month in China. I am honored to have had the opportunity to travel thousands of miles there, visiting cities, villages, farms, and factories; and to have come into contact and talk with thousands of men, women, and children in various living environments and situations.
    Dr. Gowen's statement that the American people lack knowledge and understanding of Chinese life and culture does not apply to the Soviet people. If I took my wishes to Moscow, I know that would be redundant. But the people of Berlin are eager to hear news about New China. Much of my news is fresh to the people of Paris, and the people of London are eager to listen as well.
    In the United States, it is not easy to climb over the "Great Wall of Ignorance" described by Dr. Gowen. It is even more difficult to break down the barriers of prejudice that malicious people have built in the minds of immature Americans; but I have found that most Americans, once they pay attention to this issue, are eager to hear about it from a qualified observer who has just visited New China and the Soviet Union.
    Shortly after returning to New York a month ago, Mrs. Kingsbury and I spoke at a grand welcome reception for our return after a year abroad. The audience was eager to know our impressions of the countries behind the so-called "Iron Curtain" that we had never encountered before. Recently we returned from the Midwest, where we spoke at many gatherings in Chicago and Milwaukee—labor unions, church groups, health organizations, and peace organizations. The audience was moved, and the questions they asked proved that they were eager to get first-hand information about the people and their way of life in the "new civilized world." In Chicago, I had a rare opportunity to appear on a popular television program and give a twenty-minute speech to the nation. It is said that there were millions of viewers and listeners. This was not only a rare opportunity for me, but indeed, it is just as rare for anyone in America today, if he has the opportunity to freely and truthfully report on the situation in China and the Soviet Union on radio and television and convince the American people that the people of those two great countries, like us, want peace not only for themselves but also for the whole world. In the Soviet Union, people say, "We need peace as much as we need fresh air." It is indeed encouraging to be able to get free time on a national television program to tell the American people that the people of China and the Soviet Union want peace. This is encouraging because less than a year ago, the venerable scholar Dr. Du Bois was summoned to court to defend himself against "the crime of openly advocating something that all people unanimously want—peace"—to use his own words.
    In the United States, every peace-loving person—and who isn't?—is extremely eager to know the attitude of the people and governments of China and the Soviet Union toward war and peace. All Americans can certainly rest assured after learning that there is no war mentality in the Soviet Union and China. The "Manchester Guardian" of July 7, 1952, stated:
    "British writers who returned to London yesterday after spending two weeks in the Soviet Union said at a press conference held by the Society of Friends: 'We have seen no signs of war preparations or war mentality. On the contrary, what we have seen is a fervent desire for peace.'"
    This confirms my observations in the Soviet Union and China. Let us compare this with a passage from a recent speech by Kingsley Martin, editor of the "New Statesman and Nation," upon his return to London from the United States. In his signed editorial entitled "Political Persecution in America" (July 5, 1952), he wrote:
     "Mr. Roosevelt said that America had nothing to fear but fear itself. This famous sentence is often quoted in America today. Nothing amazes European visitors more than the signs of fear. In New York, there are signs showing how to get to public underground air-raid shelters; regular air-raid drills; if someone says something 'subversive' at the dinner table, there will be an awkward silence; if a professor is suspected of being related to someone who signed the same document as a Communist, he will be in a very unpleasant situation."
    Today, this kind of war mentality cannot be seen in the Soviet Union or China. On the contrary, visitors to these countries feel that they are in an atmosphere of peace. There is indeed a fervent desire for peace there. As Alexander Watts wrote in "The Nation" magazine (August 18, 1951):
    "One of the most prominent Western observers, also an important diplomat, recently returned from Moscow and told me about the situation there: 'The people really don't want to think about war. It seems strange, they are convinced that no one dares to attack Russia... No one has seen Moscow building air-raid shelters.' He said: 'The people are very humorous, some of the humor is very similar to the old humor of classical writers. I have heard more laughter on the streets of Moscow than in any other capital in the West.'"
    People who have personally observed the Soviet Union, and who have no ulterior motives or grudges, have made this comment. Compare this assessment with President Truman's arbitrary remarks, in which Truman insisted that Soviet society "is a jungle, where the naked power of the Soviet government prowls like a beast, frightening everyone" ("New York Times," September 18, 1951); or compare this assessment with Eisenhower's speech at the American Legion convention, especially these sentences: "The many countries and hundreds of millions of people enslaved by the Kremlin have once again proved that every free country today may be subjected to sudden and terrible danger at any time."
    The wording of these speeches suggests that they may have been written by the same person, possibly someone who used to work in the State Department and wants to be Secretary of State. The tone is the tone of Harry (i.e., Truman—translator) and Ike (i.e., Eisenhower—translator), but the writer seems to be Dulles. Dulles said in Buffalo on August 26 that General Eisenhower's policy of liberating peoples "enslaved" by the Communists did not mean violent revolution, but peaceful revolution, using "mild" methods, such as passive resistance, non-cooperation, expressing dissatisfaction, sabotage, and industrial sabotage. "Soviet communism... can be stopped from within, and if it cannot be done, it must be stopped from without, which means war" ("New York Times," August 27, 1952). It is not difficult to imagine what the headlines in the major American newspapers would be if a future foreign minister of the Soviet Union made such a speech. Some have wondered where President Truman and Acheson got these views of the Soviet Union; this view is only intended to encourage people to hate, antagonize, and despise the people who can tolerate such a government as they describe.
    However, as the famous entrepreneur Bruce Barton wrote in the New York "American Journal," there is hope for reversing this trend toward war. His article has this passage:
    "I don't know if you are as uneasy as I am about the development of a certain situation in the country. One of the most beautiful words in the English language, also a kind, beautiful, and heart-warming word, is being distorted and misinterpreted, so that good people almost dare not say the word. That word is 'peace.' Officially, of course, everyone is in favor of peace. The president is in favor of peace; the secretary of state is in favor of peace; the Pentagon is also in favor of peace. They constantly talk about peace. But in reality, what dominates all their thoughts, plans, and expenditures is war... Our officials are not considering how to coexist smoothly with Russia, but are only making big threats."
    Returning home after a year abroad, I found such an atmosphere in the country, where the meaning of the most beautiful word in the English language, "peace," is "being distorted and misinterpreted, so that good people almost dare not say the word." In such an atmosphere, it is not easy to persuade Americans to attend the upcoming Beijing Peace Conference. However, there are other business people—yes, even some Wall Street bankers and lawyers—who hold the same view as Bruce Barton.
    There are many old-fashioned people who believe in our "Bill of Rights," believe that Americans have the right to criticize the policies of their government, believe that they have the right to obtain passports, and have the right to travel abroad. We have the support of these people, especially in the year of the general election, and we may be able to send a delegation of representative Americans to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing.
    As for myself, I will continue to work towards this goal. I will continue to "encourage everyone to discuss the meaning of World War III more deeply." I hope that the Beijing Peace Conference will consider the other "key points of the plan for peace" of Clark. The peace conference must agree with the second point of the Clark plan, which is: "Recognizing that universal disarmament by all countries is the key to solving world problems once and for all and obtaining real peace."
    It is not easy to tear down the "Great Wall of Prejudice and Narrow-mindedness" that has been successfully built up by a staggering propaganda campaign. This propaganda campaign was initiated shortly after the death of President Roosevelt by Churchill's speech in Fulton. The greatest Great Wall in the world has not yet been built. That is the "Great Wall of International Sincerity," the Great Wall against war, the Great Wall that defends world peace and opposes the large-scale offensive of warmongers everywhere. To tear down the "Great Wall of Prejudice" and build the "Great Wall of International Sincerity," we must establish mutual understanding and friendship on the basis of mutual knowledge. We must seriously and carefully study the various systems of China and the Soviet Union, just as they seriously and carefully study our various systems. Do not let people say again: "Every Chinese elementary school student can say the names of the great figures in our history," while "many American elementary school students, even teachers and university professors" cannot say the names of outstanding Chinese figures, nor can they "give a brief description of the characteristics and trends of China."
    Let people all over the country demand that our government promptly recognize the People's Republic of China, so that the United States can begin to establish mutual understanding with China. Every American should understand that the Chinese people respect the name of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great pioneer of the Chinese Revolution of 1911, just as the American people respect the name of George Washington; they respect Mao Zedong because he is the liberator who freed them from the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and his accomplices, and the founder of their New Democracy, just as we respect Thomas Jefferson because he is the founder of our democratic system.
    When Mao Zedong announced the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he issued a "Chinese Declaration of Independence," saying:
    "Comrade delegates: We have a common feeling, which is that our work will be written into the history of mankind. It will show that the Chinese, who account for a quarter of the world's total population, have stood up from now on. … Our nation will no longer be a nation that is insulted by others. We have stood up. Our revolution has won the sympathy and cheers of the vast number of people in the world. Our friends are all over the world." This truly recalls "the spirit of 1776." It represents the trend of the future. As Jefferson said: "We hold these truths to be self-evident."
    The American people should understand the spirit of New China, just as the Chinese people understand "the spirit of 1776." They should be familiar with "the Common Program and the Organizational Law of New China"—this is the political foundation for the national construction of the People's Republic of China, which is accepted not only by the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party, but also by the representatives of the people of the whole country; it has been accepted by "all democratic parties, people's organizations, all religions, the People's Liberation Army, all ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese and other democratic elements." It is the organizational form of the democratic united front of the Chinese people.
    If we want world peace and not world war, then these are some of the basic things that the American people must understand.
    My purpose is to do everything possible to help build understanding between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the United States and China, based on accurate familiarity. Without such understanding, I don't think there is any future. Einstein said:
    "The primary issue is to eliminate fear and doubt from each other... In the final analysis, peaceful cooperation between anyone and anyone is primarily based on mutual trust, and secondly, it depends on institutions like courts and police. The same is true for countries and for individuals. And the basis of trust is honest and sincere exchange."
    In the same article, Einstein said:
    "At the current stage of military technology, the idea of ​​seeking security through expanding national armaments is a disastrous illusion... If it works, then the air being poisoned by radioactive elements and thus eliminating all life on earth will inevitably belong to the realm of technical possibility. The terrible thing about this development is its obvious coercive tendency. Every step seems to be the inevitable result of the previous step. Later, it becomes increasingly clear to be a comprehensive destruction. Is there a way out of this stalemate created by people themselves? If people are still considering a possible future conflict when taking any action, it is impossible to achieve peace. Therefore, the guiding ideology of all political actions should be: 'What can we do to promote the peaceful coexistence and even sincere cooperation of all countries?'" ("New York Times," February 13, 1950)
    Emerson said: "God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose; take which you please; you can never have both."
    In such an era, how can a healthy person choose repose? Before Christmas 1776, when Washington's defeated and demoralized army fled across the Delaware River, Tom Paine wrote in
    "The American Crisis":
    "These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives every thing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated...
    "I am as confident as I am that God Almighty will not give up a people to military destruction, or leave them unsupportedly to perish, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent."
    Between the United States and the Soviet Union, between the United States and China, I see no future without an understanding built on mutual familiarity.

    新中国印象与西伯利亚一瞥
    美国  金斯伯利
    一九五二年六月二十六日清晨，天高气爽，在日出的时候，我离开北京飞往莫斯科，那是一次值得纪念的飞行。当飞机从飞机场迅速地上升的时候，我往下看见那北京郊外愈来愈小的颐和园，园里一片可爱的湖水与荷花是那么令人神往——以前它是中国帝王独享的胜地；现在则成了一个无匹的博物院，成了中国人民壮丽的游乐场。这是我毕生难忘的不可多得的一瞥。我们越过环绕北京的山岭向着大戈壁沙漠飞翔，那富有历史意义的中国长城真在我记忆中留下了不可磨灭的印象，它沿着山脊无穷无尽地蜿蜒伸展，耸立在半月形的屏障之巅，过去若干世纪中它曾保护北京，不让“野蛮人”入侵。
    天还未亮便得起来赶飞机离开北京，我真想说不愿这样早起，但是早起也有早起的好处。起飞后不到半小时，我们便可看见长城从东西两面伸展过来，只有在这奇妙的瞬间，飞行在二千呎的空中，背后是方升的旭日，我才能够看见这给人深刻印象的光辉的景色，这难忘的奇观——在这样一个黎明之后为黄色阳光所照耀着的中国长城上的壁垒与碉楼。
    即令是对于像我这样年老的律师说来，往莫斯科的航程始终是使人感奋的。当飞过六百哩长的戈壁沙漠，在绿洲中停留时，可以与友善的蒙古人在一起，看着骆驼细嚼小捆的草、或者随手拾起各色各样奇异的石子放在口袋里带回来作地质研究，然后，飞过数千哩的西伯利亚，那里有崇山峻岭、美丽的贝加尔湖及其他小的湖泊；巨大而曲折的河流——叶尼塞河、鄂毕河与其支流；广大的平原与草原上散布着国家农场和集体农场；还有许多村庄与重要工业中心——伊尔库次克、克拉斯诺雅尔斯克、诺伏西比尔斯克，鄂木斯克、斯维尔德洛夫斯克——到处是真正自由的男女在为了建设新的文明而忙碌着。这些不禁使我想起俄勒冈州与华盛顿州，我于本世纪初在那儿长大成年的两个州的开拓者的生活，但两者之间有着鲜明的差异：美国还不了解为了使文明建立在坚固的基础上，医院和休养所、运动场、体育场、文化休息公园、学校及高等教育机关必须与发展工农业同时并行；而这种社会生活方式，在整个苏联，包括在由北京到莫斯科的三天飞行中由空中见到的或夜间停留时所观察的西伯利亚无限辽阔的原野，无论在工厂与农村中，都可以看到。
    在新中国参观了一个月之后离开北京时，需要一个时间来回味。在中国所见所闻宛如幻梦，不然的话，一个人一定会以为他是到了一个新世界。中国的风景与生活交相对衬，真是令人神往，特别是当你由北京飞往汉口，或者乘轮船溯长江而上往沙市的时候；从武汉飞往上海，或者乘着舒适的火车由上海往杭州的时候。迷人的西湖上满盖着荷花，四周为神话般的山脉环抱着，宛如幻境。难怪从前富有的官吏在西湖畔建起富丽堂皇的大厦来接待中国的帝王了。飞过西伯利亚时，中国如幻梦般地跃入脑际，两地的差异是多么生动。风景与生活各不相同，但这两个互相毗连的国家的友好的人民，各有其令人心醉之处。
    我静想着长城，这个巨大的工程是在纪元前第三世纪用奴隶劳动经过几十年才完成的。然后我静想着今日自由的男女所建立起来的中国的许多新长城。他们成千成万自觉自愿地起来建筑屏障，抵挡好些世纪以来淹没中国肥沃的土地、摧残中国的人民的天然祸患。在毛泽东的领导下，这些无畏的人民正在建立屏障，防范洪水、干旱、饥荒与疾病。解放后不到三年，有些伟大的防洪工程堤、坝、水闸已经完成了。这些就是和平建设的伟大的长城，控制和蓄存着淮河、长江、黄河的水，利用它们的水力发电，利用它们灌溉，利用它们改进并扩展廉价的运输。在这些大河的上游，以及全国各巨流细川的沿岸，正种植着数百万棵在国营农场里培植的树苗，构成一道新的“树林长城”，一道防患的长城，一道对抗人类的自然大敌——侵蚀、磨剥——的屏障。可是，新中国的伟大的造林计划并不只限于淮河、长江与黄河的上游，也并不限于蓄水和消除水灾。计划中包括种植几百里的树林以改变气候和中国的整个面貌。最伟大的一项工程是西北防护林带，长达三千华里，最宽处达六百华里。所有这些造林工程的确构成了一道名副其实的新长城，用来保护新中国的人民不受危险的自然界敌人的危害，这是一道不用砖石，而是用树林筑成的长城。
    在我记忆中有了“世界七奇”之一——长城——的鲜明印象，这座长城是二千多年前为保护中国人民和他们的国家以免遭受外族蹂躏而建造的，很自然的，当我飞越西伯利亚时，我会回想到中国的一些新的长城，特别是我亲眼看到在建设的那些长城。我在长江流域逗留了六天，在沙市附近我看见三十万男女志愿工人像蚂蚁一般地聚集在堤、坝和水闸上，坚决要趁七月末的雨季到来之前，在七十五天内（比预订计划的九十天少十五天）把工程完成。我说“像蚂蚁一般地聚集”，是因为这些劳动群众像蚂蚁一般组织得很完善，他们边劳动边歌唱，在打破纪录的短时间内，完成着一桩巨大的任务，像一座蚁山在眼前堆成一样。
    在飞越亚洲时，还有一些长城宛然仍在我的眼前：用以抵御国内外敌人、需时二十五年才完成的解放的长城；建筑在“耕者有其田”的公平分配的坚固基础上的土地改革的长城，这是新中国自由与民主的锁钥，这座城早从万里长城开始建筑时已动工，经过不断的反封建的斗争，到现在它的壁垒已迅速地接近完成了，现在这些新生的人民终于仿佛像蝴蝶突破蛹壳似的突然把封建制度冲破了。
    掌握了这一个解释中国人民从封建压迫下突然飞跃到自由与民主的曙光时代的锁钥，人们才能理解为抵御人性中的敌人：成见与偏狭——甚至过去的地主也得到一份田，对他的处理也是从宽的，假如他的过去行为不是极端恶劣的话——而正在建筑中的其他长城。“三反”和“五反”要求人们改正那些不是命中注定的，但也是根深蒂固的人性的弱点，这些弱点都是帝制中国和百年来“外国租借”时期的生活与习惯所养成，且被蒋介石的国民党政权所承袭和加剧的。
    “三反”革新计划要求做到在全国范围内肃清新中国的三大道德上的敌人——贪污、浪费和官僚主义。这是一次深入的富有教育意义的运动。这次运动从一九五二年一月一日开始，到六月底结束。采取的方式是自我分析和自我批判，先从最上级的部长们开始，然后依次顺着政治上、社会上各个阶层一直做下来，直到最下一级。
    与此相似的是“五反”运动，它的主要对象是工商业人士和工商界，它针对着五种恶影响——行贿、盗窃或隐匿国家资产、偷工减料、泄漏政府机密情报以进行投机以及偷税漏税。这个运动虽然还在进行之中，可是听说已在反对这些恶习上有了显著的进展。
    这些就是新中国为了防御内外人性上的和自然界的敌人而建立的和正在建立的若干新式长城，这些敌人是可能使中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议于一九四九年九月二十九日在北京通过并经所有组成“统一战线”的各党各派批准的共同纲领和组织法有无法实现的危险。
    和平有一个必不可少的条件，那就是，全世界应该知道：“中国人民政治协商会议一致同意以新民主主义即人民民主主义为中华人民共和国建国的政治基础。”
    在那令人兴奋的日出时飞越中国长城的飞行以后，在西伯利亚三天内所看到的，以及栩栩如生地回忆起在新中国的一个月的旅行中那些难得的观察机会，以及农村农民领袖、教师、大学校长和教授，农场和工厂的负责人、以及各市、各省和中央的政府官员给我们作的启发性的解释；这一切所看到的和回忆起来的东西都是思想的粮食，这些东西要好好地思索一下，三天是怎么样也不够的，可是那三天的飞行中几乎没有间断地思考和细读笔记，对于帮助一个人端正对苏联和中国的新文明的态度是非常宝贵的。
    要把我的印象与思想整理出来，介绍给属于比较古旧的文明的人民需要全部这许多时间甚至更多的时间。我们必须将这新世界里正在发生的事情的真相告诉他们，因为没有知识与相互了解，这两种文明就都有被消灭的严重危险。
    早在一九二六年，伟大的学者、华盛顿大学东方语文学教授休勃脱·辜汶博士写道：
    “我们无需广博的学识就可看到，假如要使太平洋名副其实，假如要使东方与西方的接触产生双方的繁荣与文化的充实，那末必须在相互认识基础上建立相互了解与同情。这是唯一有效的方法可以避免冲突，避免人类物质与精神的成就的毁灭，避免大地的完全荒芜。
    “每一个中国的学校机关正在研究美国的制度。每一个中国小学生都能说出我们历史上的伟人的名字。有多少我们美国的小学生、大学生或甚至教师与教授能举出这个‘不朽民族’的杰出人物，或者能对这个民族的起源，它的特点与它的趋势作一个最简短的叙述呢？”（“中国简史”第八页，一九二七年纽约第·阿普尔顿公司版）
    不巧得很，一九二六年辜汶博士所描述的不幸情况显然在一九五二年依然存在。二十五年前所写的关于旧的中国的话今天仍能以加重的语气适用于新中国，实属可怕。辜汶博士写的这几句警语在今天更为重要：“必须建立（美国与中国之间的）相互了解与同情。这是唯一有效的方法可以避免冲突”——一个有灾难后果的冲突。
    所以，我想把我在东方所看到听到的一切真实故事告诉我西方的同胞们。我打算忠实详细地把这故事反复叙述和发挥，指望对更明确地了解中国与苏联所进行的和平建设与这两个伟大民族的友谊的显著的牢不可破性，有所贡献。
    我用格林维尔·克拉克在他大胆且有思想性的“和平的计划”那本书里（哈泼兄弟公司一九五○年版）所说的话来说，我想尽我的一切力量来“鼓励大家更深入地讨论第三次世界大战的含义，那么当我们体会到令人震骇的道德和物质方面的后果时，我们会更聪明地想办法来建立世界的秩序。”
    为了这个目的，我最近在苏联到处游历了几个星期。为了这个目的，我在五月里应邀参加将在九月底召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议。为了这个目的，我在帮助鼓励有代表性的美国人旅行到中国去参加九月间在北京召开的那个和平会议。为了这个目的，我正在告诉美国同胞们筹备会议所给我的深刻的印象，因为它的组织是民主的；因为它有广泛的代表性，包括各种国籍、职业、宗教信仰和政治见解；而且因为二十国的四十七个代表都有崇高的智慧和诚意。为了这个目的，我还想要不断地告诉西方的人民，特别是美国的人民，我在中国的那一个月里所看到的、听到的和感触到的。我很光荣能有机会在那儿旅行了几千里路，参观了城市、乡村、农场和工厂；在各种不同的生活环境和情况下，跟几千个男、女、儿童相接触交谈。
    辜汶博士所说的美国人民对中国的生活和文化缺乏认识和了解，这种说法对苏联人民来说决不适用。假如把我的愿望带到莫斯科去，我知道那是多此一举的。可是柏林的人民很热切地要听听关于新中国的消息。我的许多消息对巴黎的人民是新鲜的，伦敦的人民也热切地想倾听。
    在美国要爬过辜汶博士所描写的“愚昧的长城”是不容易的。要打破恶意的人在思想不成熟的美国人民心中所建立的偏见的壁垒那就更难了；但是我发现大多数美国人，一旦注意了这个问题，就很热切地想从一个刚去过新中国和苏联的有资格的观察者那里听到关于那边的消息。
    在一个月以前我回到了纽约后不久，金斯伯利夫人和我在迎接我们离国一年归来的盛大欢迎会上作了演讲，听众都渴望知道我们对我们从未遇到过的所谓“铁幕”背后各国的印象。最近我们从中西部回来，我们曾在芝加哥和密尔窝基的许多集会上——工会、教会团体、卫生组织与和平组织——作了演讲。听众都很感动，他们所提的问题证明他们急于想得到关于“新的文明世界”里的人民和他们生活方式的第一手消息。我在芝加哥得到了一次难得的荣幸的机会，得以在受人欢迎的电视节目上出现，向全国作二十分钟的发言，据说观众和听众有好几百万人。这不但对我是一次难得的荣幸的机会，的确，这对今天美国任何一个人说来，都是一样难得的，假如他有机会在无线电和电视里自由地真实地报道中国和苏联的情况，并使美国人民确信，那两个伟大国家的人民正如我们一样不但为自己，也为全世界要求和平。在苏联，人们说：“我们需要和平正如需要新鲜空气一样。”能在全国性电视节目中得到免费的时间，告诉美国人民说，中国和苏联人民要求和平，这的确是一件令人鼓舞的事。这件事之所以令人鼓舞是因为不到一年以前，那位可敬的学者杜波依斯博士，曾被传到法庭为自己“公开主张所有人民一致要求的一件事——和平这个罪名”而辩护——这里用的是他自己的话。
    在美国，每一个爱好和平的人——谁不是呢？——都极想知道中国和苏联的人民和政府对战争与和平的态度。所有美国人在知道在苏联和中国并没有战争心理后，当然就放心了。一九五二年七月七日“曼彻斯特卫报”称：
    “在苏联逗留二星期后，于昨天回到伦敦的英国作家们在公谊会举行记者招待会说：‘我们没有见到任何备战或战争心理的迹象，相反地，我们见到的是对和平的热望。’”
    这段话证实了我在苏联和中国的观察。让我们把这段话与“新政治家与民族”杂志编辑金斯莱·马丁最近自美国回到伦敦时的一段话对比一下。他在以“美国的政治迫害”为题的具名社论（一九五二年七月五日）中写道：
     “罗斯福先生说过，美国除了恐惧本身以外没有什么东西可以恐惧的。这句有名的话今天在美国常常被引用。没有什么东西比恐惧的征象更使欧洲来客感到惊奇了。在纽约，有着说明如何到公共地下防空洞去的指标；定期的防空演习；要是有人在餐桌上来一句‘颠覆性’的话，那么就会有难堪的沉寂；如果一个教授由于被怀疑与某一个跟共产党员在同一文件上签过名的人有关系，他就会处于很不愉快的境地。”
    今天在苏联或中国看不到这种战争心理，相反地，到这些国家访问的客人觉得他是处在和平的气氛里。那里的确充满了对和平的热望。正如亚力山大·渥茨在“民族”杂志（一九五一年八月十八日）中所写的：
    “有一个最卓越的西方观察家，也是一个重要的外交家，最近从莫斯科回来向我谈到那里的情形：‘人民确实不想到战争。看起来很奇怪，他们深信没有人敢攻击俄国……没有人看见莫斯科在建筑防空洞。’他说：‘人民很富于幽默，有些幽默很像古典文学作家的老幽默，我在莫斯科街上所听到的欢笑比我在西方任何一国首都听到的要多。’”
    亲身观察苏联的人，既别无居心又无宿怨的人，作出了这种评语。拿这种评语与杜鲁门总统武断的言论对比一下，杜鲁门硬说苏联社会“是一个丛林，苏联政府赤裸裸的权力像猛兽一样在那里逡巡，使所有的人都害怕”（一九五一年九月十八日“纽约时报”）；或者拿这种评语与艾森豪威尔在美国退伍军人团代表大会上的演说，尤其是下面这几句话对比一下：“被克里姆林宫奴役的许多国家和亿万人民，又一次证明了每一个自由国家今天随时都可能遭到突然而来的可怕危险。”
    这些讲演的文字使人猜想可能是出于同一个人的手笔，可能执笔人以前曾在国务院，并且想做国务卿。声调是哈利（即杜鲁门——译者）和艾克（即艾森豪威尔——译者）的声调，但是执笔人像是杜勒斯。杜勒斯八月二十六日在布法罗说，艾森豪威尔将军的解放被共产党所“奴役” 的各国人民的政策并不意味着暴力革命，而是和平革命，用一种“温和”的方法，例如消极抵抗、不合作、表示不满、怠工和在工业上的破坏行动。“苏维埃共产主义……可以从内部制止，假如做不到，就得从外面来制止它，那就意味着战争。”（一九五二年八月二十七日“纽约时报”）。假如苏联的一个未来的外交部长发表了这样的谈话，美国各大报会有怎样的标题，是不难想像的。有人曾经奇怪，杜鲁门总统和艾奇逊从那里得来这些对苏联的看法；这种看法用意只是要鼓励人们仇视、敌视和鄙视一个居然能容忍像他们所形容的这样一个政府的人民。
    然而，纽约“美国人日报”上像布鲁斯·巴尔顿那样著名的企业家发表了下面这样一段文章，从这一点看来，扭转这种走向战争的趋势是有希望的。他的文章有这样一段话：
    “我不知道你是不是像我一样对于国内某一种情势的发展感到不安。英语中一个最优美的字，也是一个和善、美丽、能温暖心灵的字，意义正在受到歪曲和曲解，竟使善良的人民差不多都不敢把这个字说出口了。这个字就是‘和平’。打起官腔来，当然，每个人都赞成和平的。总统赞成和平；国务卿赞成和平；五角大楼也赞成和平。他们不时地张口闭口大讲和平。但是实际上支配他们所有思想、计划和开支的是战争……我们的官员并不考虑怎样与俄国顺利共存，而只是在大事恫吓和威胁。”
    我离国一年后归来，发现国内有这样的气氛，英语中最优美的“和平”一辞的意义“正在受到歪曲和曲解，竟使善良的人民差不多都不敢把这个字说出口了”。在这样的气氛中，要说服美国人来参加即将到来的北京和平会议，不是容易的事。不过，也有其他的企业界人士——是的，甚至某些华尔街的银行家和律师们——也持有布鲁斯·巴尔顿所发表的同样的看法。
    有不少老派人士信仰我们的“权利法案”，相信美国人有权利来批评他们政府的政策，相信他们有获得护照的权利，有出国旅行的权利；我们有着这些人士的支持，特别是在举行大选的一年，我们就有可能派遣一个由具有代表性的美国人组成的代表团去参加北京的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    至于我自己，我将继续为达到这个目的而努力。我将继续“鼓励大家对于第三次世界大战的含义作更深入的讨论”。我希望北京的和平会议考虑克拉克的其它“和平计划要点”。和平会议一定会同意克拉克计划的第二点，那就是：“承认各国普遍裁减军备是一劳永逸地解决世界问题与获得真正和平的关键”。
    要想推倒由惊人的宣传运动所成功地建立起来的
    “成见与偏狭的长城”，并不是一件容易的事。这个宣传运动启始于罗斯福总统死后不久邱吉尔在富尔敦发表的演说。全世界最伟大的长城还没有建造起来，那就是“国际诚意的长城”，是反对战争的长城，是保卫世界和平、反对不论任何地方的战争贩子的大举进攻的长城。要推倒“偏见的长城”，另外建造起“国际诚意的长城”，便必须以相互认识为基础而建立相互间的了解和友谊。我们必须认真仔细地研究中国和苏联的各种制度，就如同他们那样认真仔细地研究我们的各种制度一样。不要让人家再说：“每一个中国小学生都能够说出我们历史上伟大人物的名字”，而“很多美国小学生，甚至教员与大学教授”却不能说出中国杰出人物的名字，也不能“将中国的特点与它的趋势作一个最简短的叙述”。
    让全国人民都来要求我国政府迅速承认中华人民共和国，使美国开始与中国建立相互了解吧。每一个美国人都应当明白：中国人民尊重一九一一年中国革命的伟大先觉者孙中山先生的名字正如美国人民尊重乔治·华盛顿的名字一样；他们尊重毛泽东，因为他是使他们摆脱蒋介石与他的帮凶的统治的解放者，是他们新民主主义的创始者，正如我们尊重汤玛斯·杰斐逊一样，因为他是我们民主制度的创始人。
    毛泽东在一九四九年宣布中华人民共和国成立的时候，发表了“中国独立宣言”，他说：
    “诸位代表先生们：我们有一个共同的感觉，这就是我们的工作将写在人类的历史上，它将表明：占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。……我们的民族将再也不是一个被人侮辱的民族了，我们已经站起来了。我们的革命已经获得全世界广大人民的同情和欢呼，我们的朋友遍于全世界。”这确使人回忆起“一七七六年的精神”来。它代表了未来的潮流。正如杰斐逊所说的：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的。”
    美国人民应当懂得新中国的精神，正如中国人懂得“一七七六年的精神”一样。他们应当熟悉“共同纲领与新中国的组织法”——这是中华人民共和国国家建设的政治基础，它不仅为中国共产党的代表们所接受，而且为全国人民的代表所接受；它已为“一切民主党派、人民团体、一切宗教、人民解放军，一切少数民族、华侨及其他民主分子”所接受。它是中国人民民主统一战线的组织形式。
    假如我们要世界和平，而不要世界战争，那末这些正是美国人民所必须了解的一些基本东西。
    我的目的是要尽一切可能的努力协助建立以精确的熟悉为基础的美苏间和中美间的了解。如果没有这样的了解，我认为就没有什么前途可言。爱因斯坦说过：
    “首要的问题就是要消除彼此的恐惧和怀疑。……归根到底，任何人与人间的和平合作首先是基于相互间的信任，其次才依赖像法庭和警察这类机关。无论对国家来说或是对个人来说，道理都是如此。而信任的基础就是忠诚老实的取予。”
    在同一篇文章里，爱因斯坦说：
    “在军事技术的现阶段下，要通过扩张国家军备来寻求安全的想法是一种祸国殃民的幻想。……如果行得通，那末空气被放射性元素毒化和因此而消灭地球上所有的生命势必已属于技术上可能的范围之内了。这种发展的可怖地方是它的明显的强制倾向。每一个步骤看来都是前一个步骤的必然结果。到后来，越来越清楚地变成全面的毁灭。有没有一条出路摆脱人们自己制造出来的这个僵局呢？如果人们在采取任何一个行动时，还在盘算着一个可能的未来冲突，那就不可能取得和平。因此，一切政治行动的主导思想应该是：‘为促成各国的和平共存以至于忠诚合作，我们能够做些什么？’”（一九五零年二月十三日“纽约时报”）
    爱默生说过：“上帝让每个人在真理和安息两者之中选择其一；你选择那一个都可以；你决不可能兼有两者。”
    在这样的时代一个体格健全的人怎能选择安息呢？一七七六年圣诞节之前，当溃败而又士气消沉的华盛顿的军队逃过了德拉瓦河时，汤姆·潘恩在
    “美国危机”中写道：
    “现在是考验人们灵魂的时候。在这个危机中，只能过顺利日子的士兵与爱国者会畏缩起来，不替祖国服务；但谁能在此时此刻坚持下去谁就应该得到人们的爱戴与感谢。像地狱一样，暴政是不容易推翻的；但我们可以引以为自慰的是：斗争愈艰巨，胜利将愈光荣。我们得来的东西愈便宜，我们对它也就愈看不起；能使一切东西有价值的是为它付出的高贵代价。上帝知道如何给与每样东西以适当的价值；假若像自由这样神圣的东西都得不到重视的话，那的确是太奇怪了……
    “我可算是当代最不迷信的一个人了，但是我内心一直认为，现在仍然认为万能的上帝不会让一个民族遭受军事上覆灭而熟视无睹，听任他们灭亡而不予以援助。而这些人又曾以人类智慧可能想出的一切善良方法，热切地不断地寻求避免战争的灾害。”
    在美国与苏联之间，美国与中国之间，如果没有一个建立在互相熟悉基础上的了解，我就看不见有什么前途。
