    Question: Is it permissible for small landlords to participate in mutual aid teams?
    Answer: Small landlords, whether they have labor power or not, should, in principle, not be allowed to participate in mutual aid teams if they only contribute land without engaging in agricultural labor. Mutual aid teams are mutual assistance organizations for farmers' agricultural labor, not social relief organizations. Contributing only land without participating in agricultural labor violates the nature of labor mutual assistance. At the same time, it is not in line with the principle of equal exchange and mutual benefit within the mutual aid team if small landlords pay wages or collect rent within the team. However, if a small landlord originally engaged in other occupations but has now switched to agricultural labor, or if they originally had no labor power but now have labor power and are engaged in agricultural labor, then their status has changed. Although they may not yet be familiar with agricultural labor, they should be allowed to participate in mutual aid teams.
    As for the production difficulties of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, workers' families, and the widowed, orphaned, childless, and disabled, these are matters of mass cultivation on their behalf and social mutual assistance. It is unreasonable to have the mutual aid teams bear the full responsibility for cultivation on their behalf and social mutual assistance. Cultivation on behalf of revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents should be carried out in accordance with the methods prescribed by the government. The production difficulties of the widowed, orphaned, childless, and disabled can be resolved by leasing land or hiring labor to cultivate it. However, if the members of the mutual aid organization and the revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, or the widowed, orphaned, childless, and disabled all agree to use the method of participating in the mutual aid team to solve their production difficulties, then it is not necessary to correct or prevent this.
    Question: Is it permissible for tenant farmers who are becoming rich peasants to participate in mutual aid teams?
    Answer: After land reform, tenant farmers who were becoming rich peasants have changed their mode of operation because the land has been extracted and distributed, becoming middle peasants. They should be treated as middle peasants (their status does not need to change only after a certain number of years). After their status has changed and after discussion and agreement by the masses, such people can participate in mutual aid teams, but they cannot be allowed to control the leadership of the mutual aid team or restore the exploitative behavior of hired labor.
    Question: Should people with the status of workers and poor people be absorbed into mutual aid teams?
    Answer: Workers and poor people, whether they originally resided in rural areas or originally resided in towns and cities but went to the countryside to receive land during the land reform, should be absorbed into mutual aid teams as long as they engage in agricultural labor after receiving land, even if they are not yet familiar with agricultural labor.
    Question: Is it permissible for vagrants to participate in mutual aid teams?
    Answer: The policy of the People's Government towards vagrants is to "win over their masses and oppose those among them who are attached to reactionary forces and actively participate in counter-revolutionary activities." Therefore, except for a portion of vagrants who in the past were attached to reactionary forces and actively participated in counter-revolutionary activities, as well as those who are unwilling to work to this day, the general masses of vagrants who are willing to work can be allowed to participate in mutual aid organizations with the consent of the masses. In this way, they can quickly learn production and be reformed as soon as possible.

### 关于小土地出租者等成分的人参加互助组的问题

    关于小土地出租者等成分的人参加互助组的问题
    问：是否允许小土地出租者参加互助组？
    答：小土地出租者无论有劳动力或无劳动力，只要不从事农业劳动，而仅以土地入组，原则上均不应允许其参加互助组。互助组是农民农业劳动的互助组织，不是社会互济性质的组织。仅以土地入组而不参加农业劳动，这就破坏了劳动互助的性质。同时，小土地出租者在组内出工资或收租子，都不符合互助组内等价交换的互利原则。但是，如小土地出租者原从事其他职业而现已转入农业劳动，或原来没有劳动力而现在有了劳动力并从事农业劳动者，那末，他的成分已经改变，虽然暂时对农业劳动还不熟悉，也应该允许他参加互助组。
    至于烈、军、工属与鳏、寡、孤、独等人生产上的困难，则是群众代耕和社会互济问题。把代耕与社会互济工作完全由互助组来担负，是不合理的。烈、军、工属的代耕，应按政府规定的办法执行。鳏、寡、孤、独等人的生产困难，则可以出租土地或雇工耕种。但如互助组织的成员和烈、军、工属或鳏、寡、孤、独者双方均同意用参加互助组的办法，来解决其生产困难，则可不必纠正制止。
    问：是否允许佃富农参加互助组？
    答：佃富农在土地改革后，由于土地已抽出分配，因而改变了经营方式，成为中农者，应即按中农待遇（其成分不必经过一定的年限才改变）。这种人在改变了成分，经群众讨论同意后，可以参加互助组；但不能让他掌握互助组的领导权和恢复雇佣劳动的剥削行为。
    问：是否应该吸收工人与贫民成分的人参加互助组？
    答：工人与贫民，不论是原居农村或原居城镇而在土地改革时下乡分田者，只要他们在分得土地以后从事农业劳动，虽然暂时对农业劳动不熟悉，也应该吸收他们参加互助组。
    问：是否允许游民参加互助组？
    答：人民政府对游民的政策，是“争取其群众，反对其中依附反动势力而积极参加反革命的分子”。因此，除了游民中一部分过去依附反动势力而积极参加反革命活动的分子以及至今不愿意劳动的分子以外，对于一般愿意劳动的游民群众，经过群众同意，可以允许他们参加互助组织。这样，可以使他们迅速学会生产，及早地得到改造。
