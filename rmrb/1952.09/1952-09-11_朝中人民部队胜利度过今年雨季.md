Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 10th: The Korean and Chinese People's forces have victoriously weathered this year's rainy season on the front lines and in the rear.

　　Long before the rainy season arrived, the logistics departments of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, based on their experience fighting floods last year, jointly formulated a flood prevention plan with the Korean Internal Affairs Facilities Bureau, meticulously arranged flood prevention work, and established flood prevention organizations. Permanent or temporary warehouses were set up in many places from the rear to the front lines, storing large quantities of ammunition and supplies, so that the front lines could be adequately supplied at any time. Before the rainy season arrived, the engineering units had repaired the main highway lines, cleared drainage ditches and culverts, and reinforced or rebuilt bridges. They also piled stones along many roads, ready to repair the road surface as soon as it was washed away. When the river water began to rise in July, the flood prevention units quickly opened up trails, constructed river crossing wharves and river crossing sites, and strengthened flood prevention equipment. They also prepared many river crossing tools in case the bridges were washed away.

　　Although the rivers in Korea did not have the huge floods this year as they did last year, the water level of rivers in individual areas exceeded that of last year. For example, the water level in some areas of the upper reaches of the Imjin River suddenly rose to ten meters on August 18, more than one and a half times higher than the highest water level of 3.7 meters in the same period last year. The Kumgang River, a tributary of the North Han River, suddenly rose to fifteen meters. When floods washed away bridges, the flood prevention units of the Korean and Chinese People's forces immediately used a large number of iron boats and rubber boats to persist in ferrying vehicles across the rapids, and promptly ferried transport vehicles to the opposite bank; at the same time, the engineering units quickly erected iron cable suspension bridges, effectively ensuring the smooth flow of transport lines.

　　The Korean and Chinese People's forces on the front lines also made thorough preparations for rain and flood prevention in advance. The troops guarding the front lines of Mount Osong in the central sector built many field warehouses very early, in accordance with the requirements of anti-artillery, anti-aircraft, anti-humidity, and anti-flood, storing sufficient ammunition, food, and dry firewood. The soldiers built thatched sheds on top of the shelters, or hung rain tarpaulins in the caves, and erected high bunks covered with dry grass and blankets to prevent rainwater from intrusion. On every mountain road and traffic trench leading to the positions, the soldiers universally paved steps with branches on the uphill and downhill sections, and built railings with wooden sticks in the steeper sections, so that no matter how muddy the road was, people would not slip. Wooden bridges were erected or thick ropes were pulled across the mountain streams crossed by the roads. When the soldiers waded through the mountain streams, they could avoid being knocked down by the torrents of the flash floods by grabbing the ropes.

　　The Korean and Chinese People's forces have won a great victory in the struggle against floods. All units received sufficient grain and ammunition throughout the rainy season, and actively attacked the invading enemy in the heavy rain.

### 朝中人民部队胜利度过今年雨季

    朝中人民部队胜利度过今年雨季
    【新华社朝鲜前线十日电】朝中人民军队已经在前线和后方胜利地度过了今年的雨季。
    早在雨季到来之前，朝中人民军队的后勤部门已根据去年与洪水斗争的经验，和朝鲜内务设施局共同制订了防洪计划，周密地布置了防洪工作和建立了防洪组织。在从后方到前线的许多地方都设立了永久性的或临时性的仓库，储存了大量的弹药和物资，随时都可使前线得到充分的供应品。各工兵部队在雨季到来以前，就已整修了各主要的公路干线，疏通了排水沟和涵洞，加固或重新架设了桥梁。他们并在许多公路旁边堆积了石子，准备路面一被冲毁，马上就可以修铺。七月间河水开始上涨，各防洪部队又迅速地开辟了便道，构筑了渡河码头、渡河场，加强了防洪设备。他们并且准备了许多渡河工具，以备万一桥梁被冲毁时进行摆渡。
    今年雨季朝鲜各条河流虽然不像去年那样都有巨大的洪水，但个别地区河流的水位却超过了去年。如临津江上游某些地区的水位在八月十八日突涨至十公尺，比去年同期最高水位三点七公尺高出一倍半以上。北汉江支流金刚川则突涨至十五公尺。当洪水冲毁桥梁时，朝中人民军队的防洪部队立即用大批铁船和橡皮船在激流中坚持操渡，及时地把运输车辆摆渡到对岸；同时，工兵部队迅速地架设了铁索吊桥，有效地保障了运输线的畅通。
    在前线的朝中人民军队事先同样周密地做好了防雨、防洪准备。守卫在中线五圣山前线的部队，根据防炮、防空、防潮、防洪的要求，很早就修筑了许多战地仓库，储存了充分的弹药、粮食和干柴。战士们在掩蔽部的顶上搭起草棚，或者在洞里张起雨布，架设了铺有干草和毛毯的高铺，防备雨水的侵袭。在通向阵地的每条山路和交通沟里，战士们普遍地在上坡和下坡的地方用树枝铺成阶梯，并在较陡的地方用木棒修造了栏杆，任凭道路怎样泥泞，走路的人也不会滑倒。在道路所通过的山溪上，都架设了木桥或拉起了粗大的绳子。战士们涉过山溪时，抓住绳子便可免被山洪的激流冲倒。
    朝中人民军队在与洪水斗争中获得了伟大的胜利。各部队在整个雨季中都得到了充足的粮弹，在大雨滂沱中积极地打击进犯的敌人。
