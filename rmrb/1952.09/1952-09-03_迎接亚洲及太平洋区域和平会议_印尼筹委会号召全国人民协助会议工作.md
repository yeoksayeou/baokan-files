Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference issued a statement clarifying the significance of Indonesia sending representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The statement pointed out: Indonesia is very concerned about the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing because the activities of establishing military bases in the Pacific are increasingly approaching Indonesian territory, and Indonesia has directly felt the threat of a new war. The consequences of this war preparation have begun to affect Indonesia's politics, economy, and people's lives. Therefore, Indonesia must work with other countries to prevent the threat of a new war. The statement emphasized: The sole goal of the peace movement is to safeguard world peace for the benefit of humanity. Due to the broadness of the peace movement, regardless of race, class, or religious belief, the Indonesian Preparatory Committee is striving to ensure that the Indonesian delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference includes representatives from all walks of life as much as possible. The Preparatory Committee firmly believes that the broadness of the peace movement will ease and reduce conflicts in all aspects, and ultimately accelerate the country's construction work. The statement finally reminded the Indonesian people not to forget the suffering during World War II, hoping that the Indonesian people would eliminate their doubts and prejudices about the peace movement, support the peace movement, assist in the work of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, so that the conference can be held victoriously, to prevent a new war, and to fight for the safety of people all over the world.

    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    印尼筹委会号召全国人民协助会议工作
    【新华社二日讯】据安打拉通讯社讯：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议印尼筹备委员会发表声明，阐明印尼派遣代表参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的意义。声明指出：印尼对将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议非常关怀，这是因为目前太平洋建立军事基地的活动正日益接近印尼国境，印尼已直接感到新战争的威胁。而这种战争准备的结果，已开始在印尼的政治、经济和人民生活各方面发生影响。因此，印尼必须和其他国家共同努力阻止新战争的威胁。声明着重指出：和平运动的唯一目标，乃是为着人类的利益而维护世界和平。由于和平运动的广泛性，不分种族、阶级和宗教信仰的区别，因此印尼筹备委员会正努力使印尼出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表团尽量包括各阶层的代表。筹备委员会深信和平运动的广泛性必能缓和并减少各方面的冲突，最后将会加速国家的建设工作。声明最后提醒印尼人民不要忘记第二次大战时所受的痛苦，希望印尼人民消除对和平运动的怀疑和成见，支持和平运动，协助亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作，使会议能胜利召开，以阻止新战争，为全世界人民的安全而奋斗。
