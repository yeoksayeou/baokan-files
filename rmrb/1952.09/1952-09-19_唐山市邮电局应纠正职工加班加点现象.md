    Tangshan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau Should Correct the Phenomenon of Overtime Work
    To the Editor: The Tangshan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau lacks planning in the delivery, distribution, and sending/receiving of postal newspapers, leading to widespread overtime work and excessively long working hours in various departments. For example, the original work standard for the newspaper delivery group was 250 to 400 households per person, but now it has increased to 900 households. As a result, there is little time to collect newspaper subscription fees, leading to an accumulation of over 100 million yuan in uncollected fees. The distribution section's work standard for distributing newspapers was 1,500 copies per person, but now the highest has increased to 4,350 copies. When the work cannot be completed, overtime work is required. The work hours for the sending/receiving group are from 12:00 noon (with a 4.5-hour break in between) to 12:00 noon the next day, totaling 19.5 hours of work, followed by one day and one night of rest. The union has raised these issues with the administrative leadership, but they have not been resolved to this day.
    I hope the Hebei Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration will help the Tangshan Postal and Telecommunications Bureau find a way to solve the above problems in order to protect the health of the employees and ensure the smooth progress of the production increase and economy campaign.

    唐山市邮电局应纠正职工加班加点现象
    编辑同志：唐山市邮电局邮报的投递、发行、收发等工作无计划，各单位普遍存在加班加点及工时过长现象。如投递组原订投递报纸的工作标准每人为二百五十户到四百户，现在增加到九百户，因此很少有时间去收报费，结果积压了一亿元以上的报费没收进来。发行股每人发行报纸的工作标准是一千五百份，现在最高的增加到四千三百五十份，工作做不完，就得加班加点。收发组工作时间每天由中午十二时起（中间休息四小时半）到次日中午十二时止，共工作十九小时半，然后休息一天一夜。这些问题工会曾向行政领导方面提出过，但至今仍未得到解决。
    我希望河北省邮电管理局帮助唐山市邮电局设法解决上述问题，以保障职工的健康，使增产节约运动顺利前进。  杨紫枫
