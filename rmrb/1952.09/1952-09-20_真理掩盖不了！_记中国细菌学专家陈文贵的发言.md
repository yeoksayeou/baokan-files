    "The Truth Cannot Be Covered Up!"
    --On the Speech of Chinese Bacteriology Expert Chen Wengui

    On the morning of July 30th, after Korean experts reported on the isolation of plague bacilli from fleas dropped by American aircraft, Dr. Chen Wengui, a Chinese bacteriology expert and director of the Southwest Branch of the Chinese Medical Association, who had investigated the Japanese dissemination of bacteria in the Changde area of Hunan Province during the Anti-Japanese War, made a supplementary statement. His statement was valued by all members of the International Scientific Commission.

    Dr. Chen Wengui said: I have re-examined the bacterial strains isolated by the Korean experts. The strains they isolated are exactly the same as the cases found by our Volunteer Army. The fact that the bacilli found by different people in different places on different patients and fleas are completely consistent is noteworthy. Based on my experience in investigating Japanese bacteriological warfare in Changde, Hunan Province during World War II and this examination, the bacterial weapons used by Japanese militarists and American bacteriological war criminals are no different.

    At this time, Zhukov-Veresnikov, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences and chief medical expert in the trial of Japanese bacteriological war criminals in Khabarovsk, a member of the International Scientific Commission, said: Japanese bacteriological war criminal Kiyoshi Kawashima once confessed that the Japanese scattered fleas in Changde with rice bran. Although I was not directly in charge of parasites at the time, my experience makes it very clear that the so-called fleas here refer to human fleas. Our parasitologist Kozlovskaya is very clear on this point.

    Dr. Chen Wengui was very excited that the Khabarovsk trial confirmed his report. He said: At that time, some scientists in China did not believe that fleas could spread plague! In fact, evidence was found in China at that time. It was found in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, in the autumn of 1940, the year before the Japanese conducted bacteriological warfare in Changde, Hunan. At that time, although the enemy scattered fleas before dawn, there were air raid alerts throughout the day, so the citizens could not return until the evening. That year, the plague epidemic in Ningbo, China, resulted in 99 patients and 98 deaths. According to the report at the time, it was confirmed that some people saw Japanese planes circling in the urban area during the day and dropping things at low altitude. After the air raid, a family found some fleas on the surface of the water in the goldfish tank in their courtyard. These fleas were sent to the Kuomintang Zhejiang Provincial Health Laboratory to make specimens (because there were no bacteriologists, no cultures were done). The Provincial Health Department prepared an official document and sent it up, noting that flea specimens were attached. At that time, the Kuomintang Central Health Administration in Chongqing announced that it had only received the official document but not the attachments, and it was said that the flea specimens were "lost" en route. At that time, the Health Administration sent the director of the Epidemic Prevention Department and a German advisor to investigate, but the true content was kept secret and not announced. Instead, the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department was condemned for its ineffective epidemic prevention, and it was believed that the plague in the urban area of Ningbo was spread from Fujian Province. At the National Epidemic Prevention Conference held in Chongqing at that time, I suggested that the Japanese invaders might be using bacteria-carrying fleas to spread the plague. I suggested that the health authorities issue instructions to raise vigilance and monitor enemy aircraft scattering fleas. As a result, not only was my suggestion not adopted, but I was warned and ordered not to leak confidential military secrets.

    Dr. Chen Wengui continued to point out: In the winter of 1941, Japanese aircraft scattered a large amount of grain and wheat in the urban area of Changde, which contained plague-infectious fleas. I personally led the epidemic prevention team to investigate. I arrived at the scene three weeks after Japanese aircraft scattered bacteria-carrying fleas over Changde. Therefore, in addition to discovering true bubonic plague that died of sepsis, I had no opportunity to collect fleas. I wrote a report, stating in the conclusion that from the perspective of plague epidemiology, it was confirmed that the objects dropped by enemy aircraft contained plague-infectious fleas. Because no physical evidence was obtained, I was criticized. Although no scientist could explain the source of the Changde plague, because it was too far from the Fujian epidemic area, it was impossible to make excuses and sophistry like the artificial plague in Ningbo. The Kuomintang government did not care about the suffering of the people of Changde. They said that there was not enough evidence and that the enemy could not be accused from a scientific point of view. Although I made a report, my direct superior at the time translated the report into English and distributed it to the embassies of various countries in China at that time. However, the director of the Epidemic Prevention Department of the Kuomintang Health Administration tricked the report into being suppressed and not published, and even revised the content, adding his own name and that of an Austrian advisor, and briefly mentioned it in the "Epidemic Prevention Bulletin." They knew that Japan had used bacteriological weapons in Ningbo and Changde, but under the purchase and oppression of American imperialists, they betrayed their conscience and the happiness of the people of their motherland for personal gain. They had never accused or dared to accuse the enemy of using inhuman bacteriological warfare. Therefore, in the autumn of 1942, the enemy used a large number of bacteriological weapons on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line in Central China, adding cholera in addition to plague, and the losses suffered by the Chinese people were inestimable. ...

    After Dr. Chen Wengui's speech, all members of the International Scientific Commission shook hands with him to thank him and congratulated him on his spirit of seeking and upholding the truth.

    Professor Madell (France), a member of the committee, said: "The materials provided by Professor Chen just now show that he is a philosophical scientist, and this attitude shows that a true scientist should take this path. Why should science be linked to politics? This is very obvious. A reactionary government will never allow the truth to appear before the world. They use various methods to deny the truth. However, the truth cannot be covered up, as Professor Chen just revealed. In the future, if any government attempts to do so, we can tell it: There were such reactionary governments in the past, and they attempted to cover up the truth forever, but the truth they wanted to cover up was exposed in the face of the war criminals' new crimes! I want to repeat: The truth will surely triumph, and the truth cannot be covered up!"

    “真理掩盖不了！”
    ——记中国细菌学专家陈文贵的发言
    新华社记者  林麟
    七月三十日上午，在朝鲜专家报告从美机投掷的跳蚤分离出鼠疫杆菌的情形以后，曾在抗日时期调查日本在湖南常德地区撒布细菌的我国细菌学专家、中华医学会西南分会理事长陈文贵博士做了补充发言。他的发言，受到国际科学委员会全体委员的重视。
    陈文贵博士说：朝鲜专家所分离出的菌种，我曾经复查过。他们所分离出的和我们志愿军发现的病例完全一样。不同的地方，不同的人员，在不同的病人身上及跳蚤体内找出的杆菌完全一致，这是值得注意的。根据我在第二次世界大战中在湖南常德调查日本进行细菌战的经验及这次检验看，日本军国主义和美国细菌战犯所用的细菌武器没有什么不同。
    这时，国际科学委员会委员、苏联医学科学院副院长、曾任伯力日本细菌战犯审讯的首席医学专家茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫说：日本细菌战犯川岛清曾供称：日本在常德撒布跳蚤是用米糠一道撒下的。当时我虽不是直接管理寄生虫，但是，我的经验完全清楚地知道这里指的所谓跳蚤，就是人蚤。这一点我们的寄生物学家科兹洛福斯卡娅是十分清楚的。
    陈文贵博士对伯力审判证实他的报告，非常兴奋。他说：当时我们中国一部分科学家还不相信跳蚤可以传布鼠疫呢！事实上，在我国当时，不是没有找到证据。在日本在湖南常德进行细菌战的前一年，一九四零年秋在浙江宁波就曾找到。那时敌人虽在拂晓前撒布跳蚤，但全日有空袭警报，以致市民到晚上才能回来。那年我国宁波鼠疫流行，共发生患者九十九名，死亡九十八名。根据当时的报告，确有人在白天看见日本飞机在市区盘旋，并且低空投下一些东西。空袭后，有一家居民在他家天井的金鱼缸中水面上发现了一些跳蚤。这些跳蚤曾送往国民党浙江省卫生试验所制成标本（因无细菌学家，未做培养）。由省卫生处备公文上送，并注明附上了跳蚤标本。当时国民党的中央卫生署在重庆宣布只收到公文而不见附件，据说跳蚤标本在途中“遗失”了。当时的卫生署曾派了防疫处长和德国顾问前往调查，却将真实内容密不公布，反而谴责了当时浙江省卫生处防疫不力，认为宁波城区的鼠疫是从福建省传播而来。那时在重庆召开的全国防疫会议上，我曾经提出日寇很可能使用带菌的跳蚤来传播鼠疫。我曾建议卫生当局发布指示提高警惕，监视敌机撒布跳蚤。结果不惟不蒙采纳，反而遭受警告，命令我不能泄露机要的军事秘密。
    陈文贵博士继续指出：一九四一年冬，日本飞机又在常德城区撒布大量的谷麦杂粮，其中带有鼠疫传染性跳蚤。我曾亲自率领防疫队前往调查，我到达现场时距日本飞机在常德上空撒布带菌跳蚤已经三个星期了，因此除发现真性腺鼠疫而死于败血症的病例外，没有机会收集到跳蚤。我写了一份报告，在结论中说明从鼠疫流行病学的观点看来，确认敌机投下物中带有鼠疫传染性之蚤。因未获得物证，曾遭受一些责难。虽然没有一个科学家能说明常德鼠疫的来源，因距福建疫区太远，不可能如宁波的人工鼠疫一样，可以推辞狡辩。国民党政府对常德人民所遭受的灾难是不关心的，他们说证据不够，从科学观点上不能指责敌人。虽然我作了报告，当时我的直接上级曾将报告书译为英文，分送给当时各国驻华大使馆。但国民党的卫生署防疫处长反而将报告书骗去积压不发表，竟纂改内容，加上他自己及奥顾问的名义，在“防疫旬报”上简略提及。他们明知日本是在宁波和常德使用了细菌武器，但在美帝国主义者的收买和压迫下，他们为个人的利益而出卖了自己的良心和祖国人民的幸福。他们一直没有指责过，更不敢控诉敌人使用惨无人道的细菌战。因而，敌人于一九四二年秋，又在华中浙赣线上使用大量细菌武器，除鼠疫之外又加上霍乱，我国人民所遭受的损失是不可估计的。……
    陈文贵博士发言后，国际科学委员会的全体委员都一致向他握手致谢，并对他寻找真理、坚持真理的精神表示祝贺。
    委员会的委员马戴尔（法国）教授说：“刚才陈教授给我们提供的材料，可以看出他是一个哲学性的科学家，这种态度表明：真正的科学家就应该走这种路线。为什么科学要与政治联系？这是很显然的，一个反动政府，它是永远不要真理在世界面前出现的。它们用各种方法否定真理。但是，真理掩盖不了，正如陈教授刚才揭穿的一样。今后，如果还有那一个政府企图如此做，我们就可以告诉它：过去也有这样的反动政府，它们企图永远掩盖真理，但是，它们所要掩盖的真理，在战犯们新的罪恶面前暴露无遗了！我要重复一遍：真理一定胜利，真理掩盖不了！”
