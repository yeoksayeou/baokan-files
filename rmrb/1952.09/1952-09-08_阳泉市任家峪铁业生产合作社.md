    Yangquan City Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative
    Zhao Shuyi
    The Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative (totaling 300 households) in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, was formed in September of last year with twenty-seven semi-back-slope and semi-inclined iron smelting furnaces and two hundred and twenty ironworkers. This production cooperative plays a decisive role in the economic life of the people of Renjiayu Village. It has driven the development of transportation, supply, and marketing industries in the village. The local people use the saying "If the iron industry (referred to as "black trade") doesn't move, nothing else works" to describe its importance. Thanks to the efforts of all members, the iron production cooperative is growing stronger day by day. The cooperative is currently preparing to purchase gas generators and install small iron smelting blast furnaces, preparing to transform scattered and backward production into collective, semi-mechanized production.
    
    From Partnership Furnaces to Production Cooperative
    The development process of the Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative is the process of educating rural handicraftsmen to "organize." It has developed along a tortuous path.
    After the land reform in 1947, the village had eighty-four handicraftsmen engaged in iron production, who organized themselves around fourteen iron furnaces for collective production. However, each furnace operated independently and was responsible for its own profits and losses. They called this organizational form a partnership furnace. Within two years, the partnership furnace continued to develop: the number of iron furnaces increased from fourteen to twenty-four, and the number of people increased from eighty-four to one hundred and ninety-two. During these two years, the partnership furnace produced a total of 2.42 million catties of iron products, with sales revenue equivalent to 1.54 million catties of millet, and the average daily income of each member was ten catties of millet.
    
    As people's income increased, the demand for means of livelihood also increased. At that time, they had to go to neighboring villages to purchase means of livelihood, which was both time-consuming and expensive, and sometimes they could not buy good things. Therefore, everyone organized an iron industry cooperative, mainly tasked with supplying means of livelihood. The iron industry cooperative also concurrently operated the business of selling iron products. In one year, the iron industry cooperative supplied goods worth 1.05 million catties of millet, with a surplus of more than 10,000 catties of millet; it also had a surplus of more than 10,000 catties of millet in the business of selling iron products. At this time, a question arose: should these surpluses "be distributed, or should they be retained in the cooperative?" After everyone discussed it, the surplus was distributed. Soon, the off-season arrived, and the accumulation of the peak season was used up, making it difficult to maintain reproduction in the off-season. Five partnership furnaces stopped production due to not being able to pay wages, and the remaining ones that did not stop production also encountered great difficulties. Under these circumstances, everyone felt the importance of strengthening leadership. They found the Yangquan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and all members of the partnership furnace joined the supply and marketing cooperative. The partnership furnaces were all changed to production groups, attached to the production department of the supply and marketing cooperative.
    
    With unified leadership, the raw material supply and product sales problems of each production group were solved. Production greatly improved, and each group began to have public accumulation. This year, there was a total surplus of more than 90,000 catties of millet. After deducting 40% for labor dividends, 5% each for welfare and education funds, and 10% for remittance, more than 36,000 catties of millet were accumulated as public accumulation funds. From then on, the members deeply realized the benefits of organizing.
    
    After the raw material supply and product sales problems were solved, everyone demanded further improvement of production, improvement of tools, and unified management. At this time, the preparatory committee of the Yangquan City Production Federation had been established, and the Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative was established under the leadership of this organization.
    
    The Superiority of the Production Cooperative
    After the establishment of the production cooperative, its superiority was quickly demonstrated. For example, before unified management, each production group had a cadre responsible for purchasing raw materials, selling finished products, and registering accounts; twenty-seven groups required twenty-seven people. Now, the same thing can be done with only twelve people, saving fifteen manpower, and saving 45 million yuan in management costs each year. The production cooperative used the members' shares and past public accumulation funds to customize twenty-seven sets of "wooden blowers" to replace the original "Niu Sibei" (a backward fanning tool). In the past, each furnace produced an average of 330 catties of iron products per day, now it can produce 427 catties, an increase of 29.4%. This technological improvement has given the members a great education, and they truly realize that to improve production technology, they must take the path of collectivization.
    
    The wage system of the production cooperative is more reasonable. In the past, each production group implemented an average wage system, regardless of the amount of output, all calculated at ten catties of millet per work unit. The production cooperative, with reference to the work point piece-rate system of the local Ganhe Sulfur Production Cooperative, implemented a labor work point wage system of "more work, more pay, less work, less pay, remuneration based on labor." That is, in the sales revenue of each furnace, deduct 4.5% of the management fee, deduct the raw materials, fuel, and subsidies for raw materials supplied by the production cooperative to each furnace, then deduct 13% of the public accumulation, and the remaining amount is the wage, distributed according to the proportion of the "points" democratically assessed.
    
    The advantages of this wage system are: wages are combined with output, the more output, the more wages; wages are combined with raw materials, the less raw material consumption, the more wages obtained; this method can give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the members.
    
    Changes in the Lives of the Members
    The consolidation and development of the iron production cooperative have greatly changed the living conditions of the members.
    
    The wages of the members have generally increased. When the production cooperative was first established, in the fourth quarter of 1951, the average wage of the members per working day increased to 18,236 yuan, and in the first quarter of 1952, it increased further to 22,600 yuan. Among them, the highest wage earners, such as Ren Zhonglian of the 16th furnace, had a wage of 53,600 yuan per working day. The members talked about their previous wages: "Before the Incident (referring to the War of Resistance Against Japan), it was 6 or 7 catties per day, during the Japanese occupation, it was only 3 or 4 catties, and the worst day was only 1 or 2 catties. In the early days of liberation, it was still 5 or 6 catties per day, compared with now, it's really like heaven and earth."
    
    Old member Ren Xigui recalled the poverty before liberation and said: "I used to work for the furnace owner for fourteen years, always borrowing, always worried, and life was still worse than poor. A family of eight didn't have a quilt to cover. In the winter, we slept on the hot kang, scorching half of our bodies and freezing the other half, turning over hundreds of times a night." Ren Xigui has made three new quilts and mattresses in the past two years, and also made new robes and jackets, and bought two Ningxia wool blankets, and can constantly eat white flour. He has deposited 1,000 catties of millet in the credit cooperative, and has a piece of foreign cloth and four or five loads of millet at home.
    
    Such families are not a minority in Renjiayu; more than 50% of the members of the production cooperative have accumulated more than 1,000 catties of millet. The members of the production cooperative have a total deposit of 95,750 catties of millet in the credit cooperative. There is no one in the village who is "starving." The sales volume of the village's supply and marketing cooperative in the past nine months was 626.43 million yuan, and the average purchasing power of each person in the supply and marketing cooperative per month was about 60,000 yuan, which is three times higher than the purchasing power of ordinary rural people in the vicinity. In 1951, the village donated a total of 18 million yuan for the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, of which the members of the production cooperative donated 12 million yuan.
    
    One Step Further
    The Renjiayu Iron Production Cooperative has grown up on the basis of the initial separation of handicrafts and agriculture. The members have been transformed from farmers into handicraft workers, but generally still have great conservatism. The Renjiayu Production Cooperative has undergone very complex struggles for each improvement of tools. There are those who agree and those who oppose, but under correct leadership, after education, mobilization, and practical proof, all conservative ideas have been overcome. During the recent period of preparing to purchase gas generators and build factories, half of the members initially disagreed. After deliberation and education, most members supported the installation of gas generators. Therefore, strengthening the political and ideological education of the members is the main direction that the cooperative needs to strive for.
    
    In addition, further meeting the living needs of the members from many aspects is also very important. "Grain and cloth" obviously cannot solve the problem, because they are already buying clocks, watches, blankets, and suitcases. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative should strengthen the supply work and better organize the production and life of the members. In addition, it should also encourage members to save.

    阳泉市任家峪铁业生产合作社
    赵叔翼
    山西阳泉市任家峪（共三百户）铁业生产合作社在去年九月由二十七盘半背半泻式的炼铁炉、二百二十个铁业工人组成。这个生产社对任家峪村人民的经济生活有决定的作用。它把本村的运输、供销等行业都带动起来了。当地群众用“黑行（指铁业）不动，百行无用”这句话来形容它的作用。由于全体社员的努力，铁业生产社日益发展壮大。现该社正在筹备购买煤气机，安装炼铁小高炉，准备变分散落后的生产为集体的半机械化的生产。
    从合伙炉到生产社
    任家峪铁业生产社的发展过程就是教育农村小手工业者“组织起来”的过程。它是在一条曲折的道路上发展起来的。
    该村在一九四七年实行土地改革后，就有八十四个从事铁业生产的手工业者，以十四盘铁炉为中心，组织起来，集体生产。但各炉独立经营，自负盈亏责任。他们把这种组织形式叫做合伙炉。两年之内，合伙炉不断发展：铁炉由十四盘增加到二十四盘，人数由八十四人增至一百九十二人。两年当中，合伙炉共生产了二百四十二万斤铁货，销货收入合一百五十四万斤小米，每个成员每日的平均收入是十斤小米。
    人们的收入增加了，对于生活资料的需求也增加了。当时他们购买生活资料，必须跑到邻村去，既误工又多花钱，有时还买不上好东西。于是大家组织了一个以供应生活资料为主要任务的铁业联社。铁业联社并兼营推销铁货的业务。一年当中，铁业联社供应额达一百零五万斤小米，盈余一万多斤小米；在推销铁货产品业务中也盈余了一万多斤小米。这时产生了一个问题，这些盈余，“是分掉呢，还是留在联社？”经过大家讨论，就把这笔盈余分了。不久淡季到来，把旺季的积累分光了，淡季就难以维持再生产了。有五盘合伙炉因发不出工资而停了工，其余没有停工的也发生很大的困难。在这种情况下，大家感到了加强领导的重要性。他们找到了阳泉市供销总社，所有合伙炉的成员都加入了供销社。合伙炉都改为生产小组，附属于供销社的生产部内。
    由于有了统一的领导，各生产小组的原料供给和产品推销问题都解决了。生产大有起色，各小组开始有了公共积累。这一年共盈余了九万多斤小米，除劳动分红百分之四十，福利及教育金各用百分之五，上缴百分之十外，还积累了三万六千多斤小米的公积金。社员们从此深刻体会到组织起来的好处。
    原料供应和产品推销问题解决以后，大家要求进一步提高生产，改进工具，统一经营。这时阳泉市生产联合社筹委会已经成立，任家峪铁业生产合作社就在这个组织领导下建立起来了。
    生产社的优越性
    生产社成立以后，很快地显示了它的优越性。例如，在统一管理以前，各生产小组都有一个干部负责购买原料、推销成品、登记账目；二十七个小组就需要二十七个人。现在同样的事，只用十二个人就行了，这样就节省了十五个人力，每年还可节省四千五百万元的管理费用。生产社用社员的股金和过去的公积金定制了二十七套“木风机”，代替原有的“牛斯拜”（一种落后的扇风工具）。过去每炉每日平均出三百三十斤铁货，现在能出四百二十七斤，增加了百分之二十九点四。这种技术改进给社员很大的教育，他们真正认识了要改进生产技术，是非走集体化的道路不可的。
    生产社的工资制度更加合理了。过去各生产小组都实行平均工资制度，不问产量多少，一律以每工十斤小米计算。技术好的闹情绪，说“这是吃大锅饭”。生产社参照当地甘河硫磺生产合作社的工分包件制，实行了“多劳多得，少劳少得，以劳计酬”的劳动工分工资制。即在各炉的销货额中，扣出百分之四点五的管理费，扣除生产社供给各炉的原料、燃料以及补助原料的费用，再扣除百分之十三的公共积累，剩下的数目就是工资，按民主评定的
    “分”数比例分配。
    这种工资制的优点是：工资与产量相结合，产量越多，工资越多；工资与原材料相结合，原材料消耗越少，所得工资越多；这种办法能发挥社员的创造性和积极性。
    社员生活的变化
    铁业生产社的巩固和发展，大大地改变了社员的生活状况。
    社员的工资普遍提高了。生产社刚成立的时候，在一九五一年第四季度社员每个工作日的平均工资就增加到一万八千二百三十六元，一九五二年第一季度更增加到二万二千六百元，其中工资最高者如十六号炉的任忠连，每个工作日的工资是五万三千六百元。社员们谈起以前的工资：“事变以前每天六、七斤，日本鬼子统治的时候，只挣三、四斤，最坏的一天只挣一、二斤，刚解放的初期，每天还挣五、六斤，和现在比起来，真是天比地了。”
    老社员任喜贵回忆解放前的穷困情形说：“咱过去给炉主扛了十四年的活，长年借支，天天发愁，生活还是糠上加糠，菜上加菜，一家八口人没一条被子盖，冬天夜里睡在热炕上，烫着半截身子，冷着半截身子，一夜要翻几百回身。”任喜贵这两年新做了三床被子和褥子，又做了新袍子和褂子，还买了两条宁夏毛毯，能够不断吃白面。他在信用社里存着一千斤小米，家里还有一匹洋布，四、五担小米。
    这样的人家，在任家峪并不是少数；生产社社员中积存一千斤小米以上者，有百分之五十以上。生产社社员在信用社的存款共有九万五千七百五十斤小米。全村已经没有“拉饥荒”的了。该村供销合作社九个月来销货额六亿二千六百四十三万元，每人每月在供销社的购买力平均约为六万元，比附近一般农村人民的购买力高出三倍。一九五一年，该村共捐献抗美援朝捐款一千八百万元，其中生产社社员捐献的就占了一千二百万元。
    再前进一步
    任家峪铁业生产社是在手工业与农业开始分离的基础上成长起来的。社员们已经从农民转化为手工业工人，但一般地还有很大的保守性。任家峪生产社历次改进工具，都经过很复杂的斗争。有赞成的，有反对的，但在正确领导之下，经过教育动员和实践证明之后，一切保守思想都克服了。在最近筹购煤气机，建造工厂的期间，开始时有半数社员不同意。经过酝酿教育，大多数社员才拥护安装煤气机。因此加强对社员的政治思想教育，这是该社需要努力的主要方向。
    此外，进一步从多方面满足社员的生活需要，也是很重要的。“粮食加布”显然已经解决不了问题，因为他们已经在买座钟、手表、毛毯和皮箱了。因此供销合作社应当加强供应工作，把社员的生产和生活更好地组织起来。此外，还应当鼓励社员进行储蓄。
