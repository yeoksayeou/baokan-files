    Hankou Jiang'an Railway Factory Achieves Success in Improving Safety and Hygiene
    Since launching a large-scale safety and hygiene inspection campaign among workers in January this year, the Jiang'an Railway Factory has greatly improved its safety and hygiene facilities, significantly reducing work-related injuries and illnesses among employees. From January to the end of July this year, work-related injuries in the factory decreased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year, and serious injuries and deaths have been completely eliminated. Among the thirteen branch factories of the Jiang'an Railway Factory, three have had no work-related injuries for seven consecutive months. The number of employee illnesses has also decreased by 57% compared to January to July last year. The absenteeism rate has gradually decreased from 10% to less than 1%.
    Before launching the mass safety and hygiene inspection campaign, the safety and hygiene conditions at the Jiang'an Railway Factory were very poor. Furthermore, some administrative leaders and trade union officials neglected to improve safety and hygiene facilities and provide workers with necessary safety and hygiene education, resulting in frequent injuries and illnesses that seriously affected the completion of production tasks. During the annual summary at the end of last year, the administrative and trade union leadership of the Jiang'an Railway Factory reviewed these serious situations and recognized that to improve production, labor protection work must be done well first. Thus, a mass safety and hygiene inspection was launched in January this year. During the inspection, the factory's administration and trade union earnestly mobilized and relied on the masses of workers, so the main shortcomings in safety and hygiene within the factory were identified and most were quickly resolved. For example, the workers' demands for "three haves" (machines have safety devices, workers have labor protection equipment, workplaces have hygiene facilities) and "two nos" (no work-related injuries hindering production, no illnesses) were achieved through the joint efforts of the administration and the masses. On the one hand, the administration allocated funds to expand the factory's medical and health facilities and purchase necessary labor protection equipment for workers. On the other hand, workers used scrap materials to solve some machine safety problems. Currently, more than 95% of the factory's machines have been fitted with protective covers; rotating motors and belt pulleys have been fitted with protective frames and barriers; and protective nets have been installed between the lathes in the repair shop. In April this year, the factory also established a technical safety study class, where workers are selected in rotation to study safe operating procedures in their spare time, so that every worker can consciously comply with safe operating procedures and prevent accidents.
    In order to completely eliminate work-related injuries and ensure safe production, the Jiang'an Railway Factory, after this large-scale inspection, has established a technical safety committee headed by the factory director and the trade union chairman, and has improved the work-related accident inspection and reporting system, making safety and hygiene inspections a regular practice. The technical safety committee includes administrative and trade union leaders from each branch factory, labor protection officers elected by workers, and activists who emerged during the inspection. Committee members regularly go deep into the workshops to study labor protection work and the causes of work-related accidents with workers, and solve problems whenever they are discovered. According to statistics from the most recent four months, more than one hundred rationalization proposals provided by the technical safety committee and workers through joint research have been adopted by the factory management committee. Most of them are suggestions on improving summer hygiene and reducing workshop temperatures. The administration adopted these suggestions and has greatly reduced workshop temperatures. The iron factory and forging factory, which in the past could not complete production tasks on time every summer due to poor safety and hygiene conditions, have both overfulfilled their production tasks in June and July this year.

    汉口江岸铁路工厂改进安全卫生有成绩
    江岸铁路工厂自今年一月起，发动工人开展安全卫生大检查以来，安全卫生设备已大为改善，职工工伤事故和生病人数显著减少。自今年一月到七月底止，全厂工伤事故较去年同期减少了百分之七十以上；并已全部消灭了重伤和死亡。江岸铁路工厂所属十三个分厂中，有三个分厂已连续七个月没有发生工伤事故。职工生病人数也比去年一月到七月减少了百分之五十七。缺勤率已由百分之十逐步降低到不满百分之一。
    在开展群众性的安全卫生检查工作以前，江岸铁路工厂的安全卫生条件很差，加之某些行政领导干部和工会负责人忽视改善安全卫生设备和对工人进行必要的安全卫生教育；因而，伤病事故经常发生，严重地影响了生产任务的完成。去年年终总结时，江岸铁路工厂行政和工会领导方面，检讨了这些严重情况，认识到要搞好生产，必须首先做好劳动保护工作。就在今年一月开展了群众性的安全卫生大检查。在检查工作中，厂的行政和工会认真发动和依靠了工人群众，所以厂内安全卫生方面的主要缺点都检查出来，并且大部分很快就得到了解决。如工人提出的“三有”（机器上有安全装置、工人身上有劳动保护用品、工作场所有卫生设备）“两无”（没有妨碍生产的工伤、疾病）要求，就是行政和群众共同努力之下作到的。一方面由行政上拨款扩充厂内的医疗卫生设备，购置工人必需的劳动保护用品，一方面工人利用旧料解决了某些机器的安全装置。目前，该厂百分之九十五以上的机器都安装了防护罩；转动马达和皮带轮全部安装了防护架和防护栏；修配厂车床之间还装置了防护网。今年四月该厂又成立了技术安全学习班，轮流抽调工人在业余时间学习安全操作规程；以便使每个工人都能自觉的遵守安全操作规程，防止意外。
    为了彻底消灭工伤事故，保证安全生产，江岸铁路工厂在这次大检查工作结束后，已成立了以厂长和工会主席为首的技术安全委员会，并且健全了工伤事故检查报告制度，使安全卫生检查工作经常化。技术安全委员会中，吸收各分厂行政和工会负责人、工人推选的劳动保护干事和检查工作中涌现的积极分子参加。委员会人员定期深入车间，和工人共同研究劳动保护工作情况和造成工伤事故的原因，发现问题随时解决。据最近四个月的统计，经技术安全委员会和工人共同研究，提供工厂管理委员会采纳的合理化建议，已达一百多件。其中，大部分是关于改进夏令卫生、降低车间温度的建议。行政上采纳了这些建议，已将车间温度大大降低。过去每到夏季因安全卫生条件不好而不能按时完成生产任务的铁工厂和锻工厂，今年六、七两月都超额完成了生产任务。　（新华社）
