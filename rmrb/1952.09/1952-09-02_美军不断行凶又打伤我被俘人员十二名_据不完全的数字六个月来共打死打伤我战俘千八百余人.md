    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st. U.S. forces injured twelve more of our captured personnel at the Koje-do prisoner-of-war camp on August 29th. Since August 11th, based only on the figures reluctantly revealed by the U.S. side, 111 of our captured personnel have been killed or wounded. An August 31st report by the Associated Press admitted: this new incident, similarly, was solely due to prisoners of war "singing and gathering together," and they were subjected to a massacre by a company of U.S. infantry.
    The U.S. side has completely torn up the Geneva Convention, and its large-scale slaughter of prisoners of war has reached a point of universal indignation and unforgivable crimes. According to materials revealed by American and British news agencies, the U.S. side killed or wounded over 900 prisoners of war in the six months from mid-February to the end of August this year. Of course, these figures revealed under the U.S. side's multiple attempts to cover up their crimes and conduct news blockades are extremely incomplete. For example, based solely on information revealed by many prisoners of war who were forced by the U.S. side to act as special agents and parachuted into our area, and according to letters from some of our captured personnel, in addition to the above-mentioned 900-plus people, the U.S. side also killed or wounded over 800 of our prisoners of war. Obviously, due to the U.S. side's adoption of methods of dispersing and isolating prisoners of war, these slaughter incidents seen and heard by these prisoners of war are only a small part of the U.S. side's total crimes. But from these two incomplete figures, the U.S. side has killed or wounded more than 1,800 prisoners of war in the last six months.
    The U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander Bonner has been promoted for his "meritorious service" in slaughtering prisoners of war. Before leaving his post, he still declared murderously:
    "We must expect more bloodshed." Although this blood-soaked American executioner has left, the many large-scale prisoner-of-war massacre events he personally directed are enough to judge him as a war criminal. Now, the U.S. side's new prisoner-of-war camp commander Cardwell has also openly stated: he will continue to implement the so-called "tough" policy of "using force when necessary" against prisoners of war formulated by Clark. This means that the U.S. side will continue to massacre prisoners of war on a large scale. These executioners must not escape the severe punishment they deserve, and the noose of justice is waiting for them!

    美军不断行凶又打伤我被俘人员十二名
    据不完全的数字六个月来共打死打伤我战俘千八百余人
    【新华社开城一日电】美方于八月二十九日在巨济岛战俘营，又打伤我方被俘人员十二名。自八月十一日以来，仅据美方被逼透露的数字，我方被俘人员已被打死打伤一百十一名。合众社八月三十一日电供认：这次新的事件，同样仅仅由于战俘“唱歌和聚集在一起”，而遭到一连美国步兵的屠杀。
    美方彻底撕毁日内瓦公约，大肆屠杀战俘的行为，已到达人人公愤、罪不容诛的地步。据美英通讯社所透露的材料，美方自今年二月中旬至八月底的六个月内，共打死打伤战俘九百余名。当然，这些在美方多端掩盖罪迹和进行新闻封锁下所透露出来的数字是极不完全的。例如，仅据许多名被美方强迫充当特务、空降到我方地区的战俘所透露，及据一些我方被俘人员来信所述，除上述九百余人外，美方还打死打伤我方战俘八百余名。显然，由于美方对战俘采取分散隔离的办法，这些战俘所见所闻的屠杀事件，还只是美方全部罪行的一小部分。但是从这两个不完全的数字来看，美方六个月以来已共打死打伤战俘一千八百余名之多。
    美方战俘营长官波纳，因为屠杀战俘有“功”，已经升官。他在离职之前，还杀气腾腾地宣称：
    “我们必须预期更多的流血事件。”这个满身血腥的美国刽子手虽然走了，但他亲手指挥的许多次大规模屠杀战俘事件，已足够判定他为战争罪犯。现在，美方新任战俘营长官卡德威也公然声称：他将继续执行克拉克所制定的对战俘“必要时使用武力”的所谓“强硬”政策。这就是说：美方将继续大批屠杀战俘。这些刽子手绝不能逃脱其应得的严惩，正义的绞索正等待着他们！
