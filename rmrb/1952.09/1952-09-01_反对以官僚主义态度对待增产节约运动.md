    Oppose Treating the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign with Bureaucratic Attitudes
    Editor: The leading cadres of the Beijing Construction Company have demonstrated a bureaucratic style in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Construction has been underway at various sites for more than two months, but no one knows how much of the increase production and practice economy tasks have been completed.
    The reasons for this phenomenon are: First, the increase production and practice economy plans for most construction sites have not been discussed by the masses, nor have they been summarized. For example, after receiving the task of 280 million yuan from the company leadership, the 5220 construction site did not try to mobilize the masses for discussion and formulate a practical increase production and practice economy plan. Instead, it talked with a few technical cadres and blindly concluded that "the task cannot be completed." Conversely, after discussion by the masses, the plan formulated by the South Line Pavilion construction site increased by 10 million yuan compared with the original assigned task (the original assigned task was 27 million yuan). Second, some leading cadres of the company still treat work with a bureaucratic attitude. The 5220 construction site has been under construction for half a month, but the Increase Production and Practice Economy Office does not know about it. Some leading cadres do not go deep into their work. For example, Zhang Zhaofang, director of the First Engineering Department, and Shen Yingjie, deputy director, have taken cars to the construction site several times, but each time they only stayed at the construction site for a dozen minutes, without solving specific problems. Although there is a very serious phenomenon of idling on the construction site, they turn a blind eye to it. A certain bricklayer holding a trowel while waiting for mortar said anxiously, "We are implementing the 'three-cut' bricklaying method now! (bricks cut off, water cut off, sand and ash mortar cut off!)" In promoting advanced working methods, the quality of the project is ignored. The seams of some brick walls are not up to standard, widening one centimeter to two centimeters. The grouting of most brick walls is not solid. The leadership knows about this, but delays in correcting it.
    Therefore, I suggest that the Beijing Construction Company quickly send a certain number of cadres to go deep into the field to mobilize the masses, and formulate practical increase production and practice economy plans, so that the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign can be rapidly carried out.

    反对以官僚主义态度对待增产节约运动
    编辑同志：北京市建筑公司的领导干部在增产节约运动中表现了官僚主义作风。各工地开工两月有余，究竟完成多少增产节约任务，没有人知道。
    形成这种现象的原因：第一，多数工地的增产节约计划没有经过群众讨论，也没有归总起来。如五二二○工地接到公司领导方面布置的二亿八千万元任务后，不想办法发动群众讨论，订出切合实际的增产节约计划，而是找几个技术干部谈了谈，就盲目的得出“完不成任务”的结论。相反地南线阁工地经群众讨论后，订出的计划比原分配任务增加一千万元
    （原分配任务二千七百万元）。第二，公司的某些领导干部仍以官僚主义态度对待工作，五二二○工地开工已有半月，但增产节约办公室却不知道。有些领导干部工作不深入，比如第一工程部主任张兆芳和副主任沈英杰等，曾先后坐汽车到工地几次，每次都是走马观花地在工地停留十几分钟，不解决具体问题。工地虽有很严重的窝工现象，但视若无睹。某瓦工在待浆窝工时拿着泥刀着急地说：“我们在实行三断砌砖法了（砖断、水断，沙灰浆断）！”在推广先进工作法中，忽视工程质量。有的砖墙缝子不合规格，把一公分加宽到二公分。多数砖墙灌浆不实，领导方面知道了，也迟迟不予纠正。
    因此，我建议北京市建筑公司，迅速派出一定的干部深入现场发动群众，订出切合实际的增产节约计划，使增产节约运动迅速开展起来。  程序
