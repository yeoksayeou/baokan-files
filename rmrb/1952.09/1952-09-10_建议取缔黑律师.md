    Suggest Banning Black Lawyers
    Editor: Currently, in some areas, the activities of "black lawyers" are very rampant and harmful to the people. I suggest the government ban them. For example, in Wuhan City, there are many "drafting services" of black lawyers located at the entrance of the court, calling themselves things like "Truth Drafting Service," "People's Drafting Service," and so on. These black lawyers make deceptive advertisements in order to solicit business, such as "My drafting seeks truth; distortion of facts is strictly not allowed," "My drafting only follows dictation, organizing the text, and does not add suggestions," etc. In fact, they are soliciting lawsuits and defrauding the people. The most common way they operate is by writing legal documents for the parties involved and taking the opportunity to extort money. For example, last year, someone appealed over a dispute of 100,000 yuan and was extorted 200,000 yuan by a black lawyer at the court entrance for writing two legal documents. Some other "famous" black lawyers demand at least 300,000 to 500,000 yuan for writing a single legal document. Some black lawyers, in addition to writing legal documents, also collude with certain parties involved and commit wrongdoings together. For example, the black lawyer Chen Zhuo once wrote a complaint for a traitor, gave false testimony, and jointly concealed the traitor's property, sharing the spoils. Even more seriously, they collude with old judicial personnel within the court, working together from the inside and outside to attack the court. For example, the aforementioned black lawyer Chen Zhuo once inquired about the news of a case from Wang Yongqing (an old judicial personnel, a bad element), the leader of the civil trial division of the Central-South Branch of the Supreme People's Court.
    I believe that in the nationwide judicial reform movement, in addition to the people's courts in various regions clearing out internal bad elements and eradicating old legal viewpoints, the People's Government should also investigate and ban these black lawyers.

    建议取缔黑律师
    编辑同志：目前有些地区黑律师活动得很猖獗，危害人民很大，建议政府加以取缔。如武汉市就有许多黑律师的“代笔处”设在法院门口，叫甚么“真理代笔处”，“人民代笔处”等等。这些黑律师为了兜揽生意，还作出骗人的广告，如“我这代笔，是求真理，歪曲事实，恕不允许”；“我这代笔，仅照口述，文字整理，不加建议”等，其实他们是包揽词讼，诈骗人民。他们的活动方式，最普遍的一种是给当事人写状子，趁机敲诈勒索。如去年有一个人为了十万元的纠纷上诉，托法院门口的黑律师写了两张状子，即被敲去二十万元。另一些“有名”的黑律师，写一个状子起码得索取三、五十万元。有的黑律师除代写状子外，并和某些当事人勾结起来，共同为非作歹。如黑律师陈琢就曾代汉奸写诉状，假作证人，共同隐瞒汉奸财产，从中分赃。更严重的是他们勾结法院内部的旧司法人员，里应外合地向法院进攻。如上述黑律师陈琢，曾经向最高人民法院中南分院民庭审判组组长汪永庆（旧司法人员，坏分子）探听某件案子的消息。
    我认为，在全国司法改革运动中，除各地人民法院应清除内部的坏分子和肃清旧法观点以外，人民政府也应对这些黑律师加以清查、取缔。
