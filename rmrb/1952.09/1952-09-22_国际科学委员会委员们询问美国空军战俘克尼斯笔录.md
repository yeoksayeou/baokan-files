    International Scientific Commission Members Interrogate U.S. Air Force POW Kniss
    The International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China has interrogated U.S. Air Force POW Kniss. The text is as follows:

    Interpreter: Kniss, please briefly tell us what you know.
    Kniss (hereinafter referred to as K): Of course, I am very willing. First, I would like to give a simple self-introduction. My name is Paul Kniss, and I am a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, with service number AO-1909070. I entered the Air Force as an airman first class in 1946, and graduated from pilot training school on July 1, 1949. On January 30, 1952, I was ordered to be transferred to Korea. On March 20, 1952, I arrived at K-46. This is the U.S. Air Force F-51 aircraft base located in Wonju. The 18th Fighter-Bomber Group was stationed there. I was assigned to the 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron of that group. I flew a total of twenty-six missions, and on my twenty-seventh mission on May 31, 1952, I was shot down and captured near Namchi, near Sinanju.

    Regarding my relationship with bacteriological warfare, it actually began in June 1951. At that time, this matter was carried out under a disguise. When I was at Craig Air Force Base, I attended a class given by Captain Laurie. He was the education officer of our base. This class was given to all pilots of the 3616th Pilot Training Squadron. I was assigned to this squadron at the time. The class lasted a full hour. He began by talking about defending against atomic bombs. Then he went on to say that the real danger was not in the planned atomic war, but in the bacteriological warfare that other countries were planning. He said that there were several ways to conduct bacteriological warfare—dropping bombs, sending special agents to smuggle bacteria into enemy territory, using submarines to launch shells filled with bacteria, etc. He said that it was expected that lectures on bacteriological warfare would be seen in a steady stream sometime in 1952. As for specific methods of defending against bacteriological warfare, there were defensive masks, vaccinations, and similar methods. I still remember that we asked him where he got this information, but he was unwilling to tell us the source of the information, only saying that he knew there was such a thing.

    My second contact with bacteriological warfare was at Camp Stoneman. On February 21, 1952, I arrived there with five other pilots. As for their names, I will tell you in a written statement later. At about eight o'clock in the morning on February 22, Captain Holleman gave us a lesson. He was serving in the equipment squadron stationed at Camp Stoneman. The content of this lesson was very similar to what Laurie had given us before. He said that we were not currently conducting bacteriological warfare. The main purpose of our lesson was to learn how to deny bacteriological warfare, to deny that the United States was conducting bacteriological warfare. In his speech, he spoke in great detail about this point. The class was short, but he repeatedly emphasized denying bacteriological warfare.

    He said that North Koreans were currently propagating that the United States was using bacteriological weapons. He said that although we indeed had many ways to conduct bacteriological warfare, such as time-delayed bacteriological bombs, bacteriological bombs containing various animals dropped by parachute, spraying bacteria, and using special agents to carry bacteria to the enemy, etc. However, our task was to deny these things. I want to explain that the American people think that if certain things are related to the military, everyone in the army will know the details. They have a habit of always asking soldiers about the truth. So Holleman said that we should deny these things in the United States, Japan, and anywhere we go. We arrived at K-46 base on the 20th, and the next day, the 21st, Captain Mclaughlin, the intelligence officer of our group, gave us another lecture in the closed briefing room.
    Interpreter: Are the 20th and 21st you mentioned referring to March 20th and 21st?
    K: That's right, it's March. The content of his lecture was completely the opposite of everything we had heard in the past. According to him, the 18th Fighter-Bomber Group had been conducting bacteriological warfare since January 1, 1952. He said that we currently use two kinds of bacteriological weapons, I mean two kinds of bacteriological warfare bombs, time-delayed bombs and parachute bacteriological bombs. The latter contains animals with bacteria, while the former contains bacteria. By June, we will start using the method of spraying bacteria. By April 30, 1952, we will send four aircraft to Tachikawa, Japan, and these four aircraft will be modified for spraying bacteria.
    Interpreter: April 30th?
    K: Yes, April 30th. These four aircraft will be ready around June 15th. They are scheduled to be ready on June 15th, and when they fly back, we will have a new order to convey, at which time all the pilots of the group will be told how to spray bacteria.

    He continued to tell us about bacteriological warfare. But I don't think he said it in detail. What he said, in my opinion, could only satisfy our minimum curiosity. He said that time-delayed bacteriological bombs use typhoid, malaria, and bubonic plague; while parachute-dropped bombs use rats, mice, lice, and fleas. He also explained how to install these types of bombs. He said that the installation should be done by specially trained personnel from the Wonju ordnance department. I personally saw these personnel, and they were as he described. These personnel wore white overalls, with white masks covering their noses and mouths, and gloves on their hands. What was special was that they used their hands to install the bombs without using any tools. I think this fully proves that this bomb is not an ordinary five-hundred-pound bomb. One person can absolutely not pick up a five-hundred-pound bomb, and even if two people cooperate, it cannot be installed.
    Interpreter: You said you saw the staff described by Captain McLaughlin?
    K: Yes, that's right. The captain also said that although these loaders wear special clothing, we don't need to wear special clothing to carry out bacteriological bombing missions. The only difference in carrying out bacteriological bombing missions is that we have to take a shower as soon as we return to base, and the next day our flight surgeon will take a blood test to make sure we are safe and sound. During the lecture, he kept emphasizing that we should keep it secret. I will talk about some details later. If things fail, that is, if we cannot complete the mission due to any accident, we cannot simply drop the bombs in an unarmed area as in ordinary bombing. We have to take them back to K-46 base. If we have already flown over the bombing line, that is, already over North Korea, we will drop them. Captain McLaughlin told us to keep it secret because the U.S. government intends to directly deny conducting bacteriological warfare for as long as possible. So we have various ways to carry out our bacteriological bombing missions. For example, if we use a time-delayed bacteriological bomb, if the mission is successful, we will report back "mission completed, results not inspected." This bacteriological bombing mission should be like a normal flight mission. I mean, in all aspects, it should appear that this is just a normal flight mission. No one will be able to detect the difference between this and a normal anti-aircraft fire suppression flight mission. When they release news related to this to the press, that's what they say—anti-aircraft fire suppression flight mission. We even use photos of the imaginary gun positions printed with the targets where we carried the bacteriological bombs. When we use time-delayed bacteriological bombs, four aircraft formations carry out this anti-aircraft fire suppression flight mission. Normally, when we carry out anti-aircraft fire suppression flight missions, we use formations of twenty, twenty-four, or more aircraft. This is also a way for you to clearly distinguish between a bacteriological bombing mission and an anti-aircraft fire suppression flight mission. When we get on the plane, these time-delayed bacteriological bombs are already installed on the plane. We have to check them. Usually, we shake these bombs that have already been installed on the aircraft bomb racks by hand to make sure they are securely installed. As for bacteriological bombs, we are warned never to touch them, just take a look to know that they have been installed on the bomb racks. After taking off, we maintain a cruising altitude of 10,000 feet all the way to the target. When we reach the airspace above the target, we dive to an altitude of 6,000 feet, and then drop the bombs. According to their explanation to us, this bomb explodes 100 feet above the ground. The explosive force scatters the bacteria around an area of about 100 yards. According to the captain, if this bomb explodes on the ground due to some malfunction, the bacteria may be killed. An aerial explosion only shoots the bacteria out and scatters them in all directions. If it explodes on the ground, the bomb will penetrate the ground to a certain depth before exploding, and the pressure it receives during the explosion will kill the bacteria. When I carried out my first bombing mission, the bomb that exploded in the air emitted a puff of gray smoke about 100 feet in diameter, which dissipated after about 45 seconds. We also had two bombs explode on the ground, and what I can point out as different from ordinary bombs is that the explosion caused debris and soil to fly to a height of about 100 feet. I believe that ordinary 500-pound bombs would cause debris to fly to about 500 feet. Now let's talk about parachute bombs. When I talked about time-delayed bacteriological bombs, I forgot to mention that when dropping this type of bomb, there is no need for special pilots or special aircraft. The same goes for parachute bombs, no special aircraft are used, and the pilots used are the original pilots from the group. The two parachute bombing missions I know about were carried out by squadron commanders. I can't remember if they explained the specific reasons at the time for why the squadron commander was sent to carry out this task. The only reason I can think of is that they hoped that the mission would be successful, and that the bomb would definitely hit the place to be bombed, I mean the correct target, hit the target area. This bomb was installed by the original staff from Wonju. I have not seen it with my own eyes, but it can be determined that it is this parachute bomb, which is easily identifiable, it is divided into two parts, and then connected by hinges. There is a small door at the tail of the bomb, and the parachute is released from this small door. This bomb is carried by one pilot in a flight. He is the only pilot in the entire flight who carries two of these bombs. He dives from an altitude of 10,000 feet to an altitude of 1,000 feet to drop the bomb. The parachute in the bomb will naturally open, causing the bomb to slowly descend to the ground. When the pilot returns after completing the mission, he calls this bomb an "unexploded bomb." The captain also told us another point to pay attention to, that is, when we are carrying bacteriological bombs, no matter what the environment, the flight altitude must not exceed 12,000 feet. Because in space higher than 12,000 feet, there is a lack of oxygen and it is extremely cold, and these bacteria and animals will almost all die. Throughout the lecture, the captain repeatedly emphasized that the content of this lecture should be kept secret. I mean, he told us not to talk about bacteriological warfare once we left that classroom. Even among this large group of pilots, we cannot talk about it, even if we all know it, we cannot talk about it. He said that the content of this lecture is classified as top secret. As far as I know, this top secret is the highest level of security classification used by the U.S. government for anything. At the end of the lecture, he took out some guarantees, which he had with him, but he only gave them to us at the end of the lecture. The wording, as far as I can remember, is roughly like this: "I know that I cannot discuss anything discussed at the meeting on March 21, 1952. If I violate this, I will be subject to the punishment stipulated by Article ×× of the War Regulations." I can't remember which article of the War Regulations was mentioned on that guarantee.
    This guarantee is kept by Captain McLaughlin in the intelligence room. If we pilots talk about bacteriological warfare and are heard, that is evidence. I forgot to say another point that can distinguish between bacteriological bombs and ordinary bombs; that is the time of loading the bombs. Bacteriological bombs are loaded onto the aircraft fifteen minutes before our departure, while normally our aircraft are loaded with bombs two hours or more before departure.

    After listening to this class, I remembered the two previous classes. What I remembered most was the class at Stoneman when Captain Holleman tried so hard to make us believe that we were not conducting bacteriological warfare, and taught us to deny it. I began to feel that some people could be so two-faced, that even those directly involved in this war were not told the truth.

    I participated in a bacteriological bombing mission on March 27, 1952, which was a mission to drop time-delayed bacteriological bombs. Interpreter: The 27th?
    K: Yes, at 5:30 in the morning on March 27, 1952, I and our leader Captain Thomas, Captain Bruton, and Lieutenant Flohr reported to Captain McLaughlin at the group briefing room. After we went in, Captain McLaughlin locked the door. He took out some photos of the small hills located about ten miles south of Sariwon. The photos showed that some of the mountains had railways.
    Interpreter: South of Sariwon?
    K: Yes, about ten miles away, and there were some blank spots on them. He said that these blank spots were gun positions. Now we are sending you to carry out a flight mission to suppress anti-aircraft fire. There is a magnifying glass that you can use to look at these photos. But when I looked at these photos, I couldn't see that it looked like a gun position or a cannon. Normally, if there is a cannon or a gun position on a photo like this, you can always see it. He ordered us to take off at 7:00 a.m., and after taking off, we had to climb to 10,000 feet to head towards the target. When we reached the airspace above the target, we dove from 10,000 feet to 6,000 feet, dropped the bombs, and then flew back to K-46 base. Around 6:45, I walked towards my plane. When I went to the plane to check it, I saw personnel wearing white overalls, masks, and gloves loading bombs there. These people took the bombs out of a covered truck by hand. Usually, they have to use a crane to lift them out. But these bombs were installed by hand. I took a look to see if they were hooked up properly, and then I got into the plane and took off. We reached the airspace above the target about ten miles south of Sariwon. There was a railway there, and our target was about 100 feet from the railway. We arrived at the airspace above the target at 8:00. We dove to 6,000 feet, and then dropped the bombs. I saw six bombs explode in the air, and two exploded when they reached the ground. We climbed to 10,000 feet, and flew back to K-46, landing at about 9:00. We went to the group intelligence room and reported to Captain McLaughlin: "Mission completed, results not inspected." After that, we went to the bathroom to take a shower. In the bathroom, I said to Captain Thomas, "Showering will clean my body, but my heart will never be cleansed after I have done this." I believe it is very clear to say that, and I can't think of any other words to express my unpleasant feelings at the time. I know that others felt the same way, and they were not as happy as they usually were after completing a mission. I said they were happy not because they had killed people, but because they often talked after completing a mission. They would talk about how they were almost shot down during this mission, etc. They didn't talk about anything that time, and you could see from their attitude that they didn't like this mission very much. The next morning at 8:00, we went to the doctor, and he checked our blood.

    April 29th was my birthday, and I celebrated it a little in the bar. After drinking some wine, I was a little excited and talked about general policies. At that time, I was talking to Lieutenant Daleo in our 12th Squadron. I complained about living conditions, etc. I talked about morale, talked about how we didn't like everything in Korea, and I was generally referring to the Korean War. I specifically mentioned bacteriological warfare, and generally said that I had to carry out a mission to drop bacteriological bombs once. He said, "Don't feel bad about it." He himself had also conducted bacteriological warfare. I knew that everyone in the group was doing it, but I didn't know when they were carrying out that mission. He told me that on April 5, 1952, he and Lieutenant Curry, Lieutenant Jansen, and Lieutenant Randall dropped eight time-delayed bacteriological bombs about five miles south of Sinanju. He also told me that on April 15, 1952, Lieutenant Colonel Kline, the commander of our 12th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, dropped two "unexploded bombs" five miles east of Sonchon. At around 9:00 in the morning on May 5th, when I was looking at the bulletin board in the intelligence room, I met Lieutenant Colonel Grove who came in to talk to Captain McLaughlin. He had just returned from completing a mission. He said that he had dropped two "unexploded bombs" near Pyongyang. On May 21, 1952, I was sitting in the barracks, and Captain Thomas came over and told me that Lieutenant Williams of the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron led four aircraft to Kunu-ri. They dropped eight time-delayed bacteriological bombs there.

    This is the whole situation of the bacteriological bombing missions carried out in Korea that I know about. Obviously, I know that our group carried out more than what I just said. But what I personally saw and heard is this. Judging from Captain McLaughlin's tone when he spoke to me, I knew that there were more than just these few missions. I would like to show you that I believe I can represent all my colleagues in the entire 18th Fighter-Bomber Group to say one sentence: these missions were not carried out willingly. They were actually forced to do it. I myself know that I was unwilling, and I don't think I was particularly unwilling to carry out bacteriological bombing missions. I am just an ordinary person, and I know that other people are as ordinary as I am. They all feel disgusted by the other inhumane acts that are actually being committed in this war. Such as napalm bombing, saturation bombing. This is not peace, I mean, it is not like the kind of war that the American people used to engage in.
    Interpreter: Is that all you have to say at the moment?
    K: Yes, that's all I know about bacteriological warfare.
    Needham (Britain, hereinafter referred to as N): So, now is the time to ask questions.
    Zhukov-Veresnikov (Soviet Union, hereinafter referred to as Zh): Did you mention that malaria parasites were used in the bacteriological bombs?
    K: Yes, sir. As I said before, that's what Captain McLaughlin told me. He never talked about any part of bacteriological warfare in detail, he only told us some to satisfy our minimum curiosity.
    Olivo (Italy, hereinafter referred to as O): Were the pilots participating in these missions vaccinated against the bacteria they were using?
    K: Yes, I have been vaccinated against typhoid and malaria. I have been vaccinated countless times. Before leaving the United States, I had three plague vaccinations. They told us at the time that this was enough before we went abroad. But at Camp Stoneman we got three more shots. One of them was typhoid, and I can't determine what the other two were. But I mean, we got additional vaccinations at Camp Stoneman.
    Madell (France, hereinafter referred to as M): There is also a point, you did not say that you did not attend college, I want to know about your experience before you became a pilot?
    K: This question is easy to answer. My father has been a farmer for most of his life, but he didn't own any land. He was a tenant farmer. He spent most of his life on the land. I have lived mostly in Monmouth, Illinois. I lived on a farm for eight years, and the rest of the time I lived in Monmouth, Illinois and another small town in Illinois. The former has a population of about 10,000, and the latter is really a small town, with a population of only about 1,000.
    Interpreter: What's the name of the small town you mentioned?
    K: Keithsburg. I went to school in both of these towns. I studied at Monmouth High School for a year and a half, because my father couldn't afford the tuition, so I had to drop out after a year and a half. I was not satisfied with the clothes I wore, and when I was with other students, I thought maybe it was because of self-esteem, or maybe for other reasons, whatever you say, I was not very willing to associate with them. In 1944, when I just reached the standard age, I joined the Navy. At that time, I was only three days past their required minimum age standard. I worked in the Navy for two years. After I left the Navy in May 1946, I still couldn't find any satisfactory work. I had no opportunity to improve myself, which was due to my lack of education and ability, so I joined the Air Force in December of the same year.
    Interpreter: December of '46?
    K: Yes.
    N: Does Madell want to continue asking questions?
    N: Dr. Madell said that he always felt that if Mr. Kniss had the opportunity to go to college, he would be a good student, so he thought that the committee could ask him various technical questions. I believe he will answer these questions well.
    N: Okay, if no one wants to ask questions at the moment, I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mr. Kniss whether he has ever heard any hints in his conversations that there is a parachute attached to a paper container, which has an equipment that can ignite and destroy traces after releasing everything it contains inside?
    K: No. I have never heard of anything like that. But judging from their current efforts to conceal the situation of bacteriological warfare, this is a logical conclusion. In my opinion, they would even want to destroy any evidence on the ground. I remember once they told us that they wanted to make the North Korean people think that the various diseases currently spread in Korea by bacteriological weapons are all the inevitable products of war. In other words, the water supply system has been damaged, etc., for example, the standard of living has declined. But I have never heard of the thing you just mentioned, of course Captain McLaughlin would never tell us; he only said that there is a parachute inside.
    O: You said that when you went to check the bombs, they told you not to shake them?
    K: Yes.
    O: Do you think that was because of the fragility of the bombs or because doing so might harm the insects inside the bombs?
    K: In my personal opinion, there may be many reasons, either because of the fragility of the bombs, or because of fear of harming the bacteria inside. I don't know where the bacteria are placed in the bombs, how they are put in, and what the situation inside is. Another reason is that we absolutely don't want the bombs to fall off the bomb racks. Speaking of this, I would like to mention something I forgot to tell you before. Our aircraft always have to be disinfected with steam every time they return from a mission. This fact may prove that there may also be bacteria on the outside of the bombs. I think this is just another safety precaution to keep ourselves from coming into contact with the bacteria.
    N: I don't know if I can ask the previous question again, that is, whether Mr. Kniss has heard of a bomb, or rather a container, made of something very, very brittle and fragile, like an eggshell, which breaks into countless pieces when it touches the ground, so that no one can find it?
    K: No, I have never heard of this kind of bomb. But I think they are capable of doing anything. I mean, they have already used so many different methods in Korea. When I was talking to Mr. Becart (editor's note: reporter from the French Paris Evening News), he told me a few of these methods. But they are capable of doing this in order to cover up their bacteriological warfare. As I said, pilots almost never talk about bacteriological warfare. This is also very special, because I think Americans are more talkative than any other nation, they like to talk to each other very much. But they really kept this topic a secret. Except for the two times I mentioned above, I have never heard pilots mention bacteriological warfare; unless there are only two of them together, with no third person around.
    However, talking about bacteriological warfare is an extremely serious violation of discipline, I mean if we are heard, we will definitely be severely reprimanded.
    Andreine (Sweden, hereinafter referred to as A): Does Mr. Kniss know where the bombs were made? Do you think they were made in the United States, filled with small animals, insects, and bacteria, and then transported here?
    K: I can't answer correctly where these bombs came from. But I definitely know one thing: there is only a small arsenal in Wonju, and they wouldn't have this kind of equipment. I know that this kind of bomb is not made there. Because I think that manufacturing this kind of bomb and loading bacteria, etc., requires quite a lot of instruments and components.
    A: How long do you think it takes for these animals, insects, and bacteria to be transported from the United States to use, and how long do they need to be kept in the container?
    K: It doesn't take long to transport them from the United States, 36 hours. This is the time it takes me to fly from the United States to Japan. I mean, the time it takes them to airlift bacteria, etc. from the United States to Korea is the same as it takes me to come from the United States to Japan. I came on a DC-6 aircraft, and they can use another aircraft to transport them, I believe they will use a C-97, which will be faster. I mean, these bacteria, etc. don't have to be kept in the bomb for too long.
    A: There is another related question. In my opinion, it still takes a little long to fill them in the United States, transport them, and add the waiting time for use. Have you considered the possibility of a manufacturing base in Japan?
    K: Yes, I mean, it is a well-known fact that the U.S. military has many large bases in Japan. Like Tachikawa base is one of the largest bases I have seen. I have been there twice: once when I came to Korea, and once when I went on vacation. But I have only seen part of the entire base. I am saying that this base is very large, and it is very possible that they are engaged in this work there, because our aircraft went there to install bacterial sprayers. I mean, they were probably made in Tachikawa. It is also the Air Material Command Base there, which means a large supply base. I think it is about fifteen miles long, which can estimate how big it really is.
    M: You said that your companions who participated in bacteriological warfare hated their actions. Are you sure that your observation is correct? You seem to understand social injustice, but do your companions have the same understanding as you in this regard?
    K: Yes, I can say that my observation of people is correct in more than 90 percent of the cases. It is true that a few people come from better environments than me, and their families are wealthier than mine. But this is not the case for most people. Most of the pilots at K-46 base were re-enlisted. I mean, they are not the kind of regular soldiers you are talking about. Most of them are workers for life. I think I am quite sure to say this. You can often see people from small things; from their reactions. I feel that people think this way, and I know a lot.
    M: What work have you actually done to test their reaction to make accurate and sharp observations?
    K: One time was the reaction after I returned from the mission I participated in, I mean everyone's attitude. Normally, when we return from a mission, we always say, "Did you see that I was almost shot down?" This kind of thing. Usually everyone makes good-natured jokes. As I said before, it's not that they are happy about the mission, even in the most unpleasant times, you always have to find something to say a joke. But now everyone is extremely dissatisfied, and they are unhappy in their hearts. I was also overseas during the last war, but the morale is different from the people now in South Korea, compared with World War II, our morale is worlds apart, I mean, in terms of morale, there is no comparison. Today's pilots are not as willing to sacrifice their lives as the pilots in the last war. Today, most pilots have the impression of completing one hundred missions as soon as possible and then going home. I think the fact that they are unwilling to sacrifice their lives is very obvious to me, and they don't believe in their cause. They object to the reason that they are currently being driven.
    M: Do the pilots who participate in bacteriological warfare missions drink a lot of alcohol after completing the mission?
    K: Yes, excessive drinking is one thing I noticed at K-46 and K-10—the two bases we used. I believe that a person is more likely to show his true colors when he is drinking than when he is not drinking. Generally speaking, when a pilot in the United States drinks alcohol and is a little excited, they are happy, they always want to have some fun or do some pranks. But the pilots here are not like that. They are unhappy and often fight. I have not seen more than two fights in the officers' club in the United States, but at K-46 and K-10, fights are common.
    M: Do those pilots feel that they are participating in an unjust war? Or are they fighting for a sacred cause like they were in World War II?
    K: No, I believe that most pilots believe that the difference between this war and the last war is like day and night. As I said before, another reason is that people are simply unwilling to sacrifice for the country. They are not enthusiastic. They are just doing their job perfunctorily. I have heard that pilots deliberately missed their targets—our main target is the railway. I myself have done this many times—I have aborted attacks when I encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire. This has never happened in the last war. As I said, these people just want to complete their hundred missions and go home. It is easy to see that their hearts are not in the war, but they are unwilling to come out and express opposition to the government. The discipline of the U.S. military stipulates that you cannot make statements against the government.
    M: Is the pilots' unwillingness to participate in the war a general feeling or a feeling generated by the fact that this war is an unjust war?
    K: I believe that it is a feeling generated by an unjust war, I mean the way we fight, dropping napalm bombs, and the targets are often Korean civilian houses or similar places. It is obvious that these are not military targets. Anyone with a brain can understand this truth.
    The Kaesong armistice negotiations are another thing that makes people feel dissatisfied. If our country needs peace so much, why don't we achieve an armistice in Kaesong? Why continue the war and continue to cause casualties to the people on both sides? Why prolong this unnecessary slaughter? There is also bacteriological warfare, our policy was originally to save Korea from communist contagion, that is to say we want to save the people and give them democracy. But you can't kill the people you want to save. You can't use mass killing methods. That is fascism.
    Another example is unnecessarily injuring people by strafing. When we dive towards the target, we often strafe with machine guns, which has a psychological effect on the gunners on the ground—if there are guns on the ground—making them afraid to look up and fire at us. When we bomb the railway, we often cut off an entire straight section of the track that is easy to bomb. If there is a small town on that section of the track, it doesn't matter if we strafe that town. We don't talk about any rules or principles at all. This is a total war. Destroying everything is the actual policy.
    Another example that I personally know about is the napalm bombing carried out by the group. Although I didn't participate in it personally, I have talked to people who came back after carrying out this bombing, and when I was standing and talking enthusiastically, one person came over and said, "Did you see me drop the bomb on that building? That place looked like a school." I still remember another person's words: "Isn't that something to be proud of!?" It was very ironic to say that to that person. But the conversation ended there.
    I have seen situations where pilots are reprimanded in films. We show our battle photos every two or three days. Whenever the machine gun is fired, a hand appears on the screen to point out whether you are firing the machine gun. I have seen them being reprimanded for not firing enough. I saw their plane coming down over a house or a place, and if the machine gun stopped firing, the hand would retract. I have personally seen people being reprimanded for not firing.
    N: Now I want to ask one last question. We are too far away from the topic of bacteriological warfare now, but this is very interesting, and from the general background of conducting bacteriological warfare, it is also worth studying. What interests me most about the last narrative is, in my words, that those pilots have already "become tired of this situation." What is said above is still a matter of method. Now what I want to ask is, what about propaganda? I mean, they are thoroughly disgusted with the methods they have to adopt, but at the beginning of this war there was a lot of propaganda about the nature of the United Nations, about collective security, and all sorts of things like that. Only a few people in the Western countries—if not a few, at least not everyone—saw through this propaganda, and recognized all the other aspects of things. So what I want to ask is—I don't know if I have made it clear—are there really only very few or even no active servicemen who have been deceived by that propaganda, and really feel that all the United Nations propaganda is really a cloak of aggression, a cloak of Asian countries being dominated by non-Asian countries. It is difficult for me to express my meaning completely clearly, but I hope I have made it clear.
    K: Yes, from the perspective of someone who has conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea and actually participated in the Korean War, they have seen this clearly from all aspects. People go out to bomb buildings—here what I call buildings are earthen houses built and inhabited by the Korean people. They go to carry out this mission and report back that many buildings have been destroyed. Our group has a kind of bulletin, which is often posted on the bulletin board in the group briefing room. The news on these bulletins says that many barracks have been bombed by the glorious 18th Fighter-Bomber Group. That's how it is. They never publish the facts that many civilian houses have been destroyed, but say that barracks have been destroyed. They only tell the truth when they cut off the railway, saying that the 18th Air Force Group completed ten railway cut-off bombings today. They never say where they bombed, whether it was a town or other place, for example, when bombing Pyongyang, or Sinanju, or other cities, they always have a target in that city. They don't want to destroy everything in the city, they have special targets. Special target is a word

    国际科学委员会委员们询问美国空军战俘克尼斯笔录
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会委员们询问美国空军战俘克尼斯笔录。文如下：
    译员：克尼斯，请你简单地告诉你所知道的一些情形。
    克尼斯（以下简称克）：当然，我是很乐意的。开始我想做一个简单的自我介绍。我的名字是保罗·克尼斯，是美国空军后备队的中尉，军号是AO—1909070。一九四六年我进入空军作一名上等兵，一九四九年七月一日在飞行员训练所毕业。一九五二年一月三十日奉命要调我赴朝鲜。一九五二年三月二十日到达K—46。这是位在原州的美国空军F—51型飞机的基地。第十八战斗轰炸机大队就驻在那儿。我被派在该大队第十二战斗轰炸机中队。我一共执行了二十六次任务，在一九五二年五月三十一日执行第二十七次任务时在靠近新安州的Namchi地方被击落后被俘。
    关于我同细菌战的关系，事实上可说是从一九五一年六月开始的。那时这种事情是在一种伪装下进行的。我在克莱格（Craig）基地的时候，听了劳瑞上尉给我们上的一堂课。他是我们基地的教育军官。这堂课是他给第三六一六驾驶员训练中队全体驾驶员上的。当时我也被编在这个中队里面。这堂课足有一个钟头。开始他讲了一些关于防御原子弹的话。然后他接下去说真正的危险，不在于正在计划中的原子战，而在于别的国家正在计划着的细菌战。他说进行细菌战的方法有好几种——投炸弹，派特务偷运细菌到敌区去，用潜水艇发射满装细菌的炮弹等。他说预料在一九五二年某一个时候能够看见将有川流不息的关于细菌战的讲演。至于防御细菌战争的特殊方法有防御面具，注射预防针及诸如此类的方法。我现在还记得当时我们曾问过他关于这些情报他是从那里得来的，但是他不愿告诉我们这情报的来源，只说他晓得有这么一回事。
    我第二次与细菌战发生关系是在史东曼（CampStoneman）营地。一九五二年二月二十一日我同其他五个驾驶员到达了那里。至于他们的名字我将在书面声明中再告诉诸位。二月二十二日早晨约八点钟的时候，何礼门上尉（Captain Holleman）给我们上了一堂课。他是派在史东曼营地的配备中队服务的。这堂课的内容很像以前劳瑞（Laurie）给我们上的。他说我们现在并没有在进行细菌战。我们这堂课的主要目的是学会怎样去否认细菌战，否认美国是在进行细菌战。在他的讲演中，关于这一点说得特别详细。这堂课时间很短，但是他一再强调要否认细菌战。
    他说目前北朝鲜人正在宣传美国使用细菌武器。他说虽然我们确已有好多种进行细菌战的方法，如定时细菌弹，用降落伞降落置有各种动物在内的细菌弹、喷射细菌和用特务把细菌带敌方去等等。但是，我们的任务是去否认这些事情。我要解释一下，美国老百姓以为如果某些事情是与军事方面有关的话，所有在军队里的人都会晓得其中的底细的，他们便有一种脾气，老是向军人询问究竟。所以何礼门说，我们要在美国国内，在日本和任何我们所到的地方否认这些事情。我们是二十日到达K—46基地的，就在第二天，二十一日，我们大队的情报官麦克拉夫林上尉（Captain Mclaughlin）在关着门的传令室又给我们上了一堂课。
    译员：你说的二十日、二十一日，是指的三月二十日、二十一日吗？
    克：对的，是三月。他讲课内容是我们过去所听到的一切完全相反的一回事。照他所说，第十八战斗轰炸机大队自从一九五二年一月一日起已经开始在进行细菌战了。他说目前我们用两种细菌武器，我是说用两种细菌战的炸弹，定时弹和用降落伞的细菌弹。后面这一种是装有带细菌的动物的，前面那一种则装有细菌。到了六月，我们就要开始使用喷射细菌的方法。到一九五二年四月三十日我们将要派四架飞机到日本立川（Tachikawa）去，这四架飞机将改装为喷射细菌之用。
    译员：四月三十日吗？
    克：对，四月三十日。这四架飞机在六月十五日左右就会准备妥当。它们预定在六月十五日准备好，飞回原地时，我们将有一次新的命令传达，那时会告诉大队所有的驾驶员如何喷射细菌的方法。
    他继续把有关细菌战的情报说给我们听。但是我不认为他说得很详尽。他所说的在我看来只能够满足我们最低的好奇心。他说定时细菌弹用伤寒、疟疾和腺鼠疫三种病；而用降落伞投掷的炸弹，用老鼠，鼷鼠，虱子和跳蚤。他又解释如何安装这类炸弹。他说安装是要由原州军械部门受过特殊训练的人员来做。我亲自看见过这些人员，他们是一如他所形容的那样。这些人员穿的是白色工作服，鼻子和嘴都用白色口罩掩起来，手上还戴着手套。特别的是他们用双手装炸弹而不用任何工具。我看这可充分证明这种炸弹不是普通五百磅的炸弹。一个五百磅的炸弹一个人绝对拿不起来，即使二个人合作，也是装不上去的。
    译员：你说你曾看见过麦克拉夫林上尉所形容的那些工作人员？
    克：是的，不错。上尉又说这些装弹人员虽然穿戴特制的服装，但是我们用不着穿特别的服装来执行投细菌弹任务。执行投细菌弹的任务唯一不同的地方是我们一回到基地，马上要洗个淋浴，第二天由我们的飞行外科医生验血，确定我们是否安然无恙。他在讲课的时候一直在强调我们要保守秘密。关于这一点，我以后还要谈一些详细情节。如果事情失败，就是说如果我们因为任何事故不能完成任务，我们不能照平常轰炸一样，把炸弹丢在非武装地区了事。我们要把它们带回K—46基地。如果我们已经飞过了轰炸线，那就是说已经在北朝鲜上空，我们就丢下去。麦克拉夫林上尉告诉我们要守秘密，这是因为美国政府打算尽可能长久直截了当地否认进行细菌战。所以我们有各种各样的执行我们投细菌弹任务的方法。比如说，如果我们用的是一颗定时细菌弹，如果任务是成功的，回来作报告时便说：“任务完成，结果未加视察”。这种投掷细菌弹的飞行任务要当通常飞行任务一样。我的意思是说在各方面都表示出这不过是通常飞行任务。什么人都无从发觉这和通常压制高射炮火飞行任务有不同的地方。如果他们对报界发表与这有关的消息时，他们就是这样说的——压制高射炮火飞行任务。我们甚至用印有我们所携带的细菌弹的投掷目标假想炮位的照片。在我们使用定时细菌弹时，是四架飞机编队执行这种压制高射炮火飞行任务的。通常执行压制高射炮火飞行任务，我们用二十架，二十四架或更多的飞机编队。这也是你明白区别投掷细菌弹飞行任务还是压制高射炮火飞行任务的一种方法。当我们上机时，这些定时细菌弹已经装在飞机上。我们要检查一下。通常我们是用手摇一摇这些已经装在飞机炸弹架上的炸弹，确知它们是否已经装稳了。至于细菌弹，我们却接到警告千万不可碰着，只是看一下，知道它们已装好在炸弹架上便算了。起飞后，我们一路保持一万呎的巡航高度飞向目标。到达目标上空时，我们俯冲至六千呎的高度，然后投弹。据他们对我们的解释，这种炸弹是在离地面一百呎时爆炸。爆炸力把细菌飞散在周围一百码左右的地方。据上尉说，如果这种炸弹因为某种故障，到了地面才爆炸，细菌可能被杀死。在空中爆炸仅把细菌射出来，向四处飞散。如果在地面爆炸，炸弹会深入地面若干深度才爆炸，爆炸时所受到的压力会杀死细菌。当我第一次执行投弹任务时，空中爆炸的炸弹发出一团约直径一百呎的灰烟，经过约四十五秒钟才散开。我们还有两枚炸弹在地面爆炸，我能举出的这些爆炸与普通炸弹不同处是爆炸使碎片和泥土飞扬到约一百呎的高度。我相信普通五百磅炸弹会使碎片飞到五百呎左右的。现在说用降落伞的炸弹。在我说定时细菌炸弹时，我忘记提到在投这种炸弹时，并不用特别的驾驶员，并不用特别的飞机。降落伞炸弹也一样，不用特别飞机，用的驾驶员也是大队中原有的驾驶员。我所知道的两次降落伞炸弹投掷任务，都是由中队长们执行的。为什么要中队长来执行呢，我想不起来他们当时有否说明过具体理由。我能够想到的唯一理由是他们希望任务能一定胜利完成，炸弹一定击中要轰炸的地方，我意思说是正确的目标，击中目标区域。这种炸弹是由从原州来的原来那批工作人员安装的。我并没有亲眼看见过，不过可以断定是这种降落伞炸弹，这种炸弹很容易识别，它分成两个部分，然后再用铰链连在一起。炸弹尾部有一个小门，降落伞就是由这小门中放出。这种炸弹由一个机群中的一个驾驶员携带。他是整个机群中唯一携带两颗这种炸弹的驾驶员。他从一万呎高空俯冲到一千呎高度投下炸弹。炸弹中的降落伞便自然张开，使炸弹徐徐降落地面。驾驶员执行任务完毕回来作报告的时候，把这种炸弹叫做“不爆炸的炸弹”。上尉又告诉我们另外一点应该注意的，就是我们在携带细菌弹的时候，无论环境如何，飞行高度不能超过一万二千呎。因为比一万二千呎再高的空间，氧气缺乏，异常寒冷，这些细菌和动物差不多都会死亡。在整个讲课过程中，上尉一再强调这堂讲课内容要保守秘密。我意思是说，他告诉我们一出那间课堂，就不要再谈细菌战。就是在这一大队飞行员中间，也不能交谈，即使我们大家都知道，可是不能交谈。他说这堂讲课内容列为最密件。就我所知，这种最密件是美国政府对任何事情所用的最高一级的机密分类用语。在讲课结束时，他拿出一些保证书来，这些保证书是他带着的，不过他到讲课结束时才发给我们。其中措辞，尽我可能记忆的大概是如此：“我知道我不能讨论在一九五二年三月二十一日会上所讨论的任何东西。如有违犯，我将受战争条例第××条所规定的惩罚”。我现在已记不清那保证书上提到的战争条例是那一条了。
    这个保证书由麦克拉夫林上尉保存在情报室内。如果我们驾驶员们谈到细菌战而被听到了，那就是证据。我忘记说另外可以区别细菌炸弹和普通炸弹的一点；就是装弹的时间。细菌弹是在我们出发前十五分钟才装上飞机，而通常我们在出发二个钟头或二个多钟头以前，飞机上就都装好炸弹了。
    在听完这堂课后，我想起了已往的二堂课。我想起的主要是在史东曼时何礼门上尉拚命要想使我们相信我们并没有在进行细菌战，并教我们否认这种事的那堂课。我开始觉得有些人竟会是这样的两面性，就连直接进行这种战争的人都未被告知事情的真相。
    我参加投掷细菌弹的飞行任务是在一九五二年三月二十七日，这是一次投掷定时细菌弹的飞行任务。译员：二十七日么？
    克：是的，在一九五二年三月二十七日早晨五时半，我和我们的领队汤姆斯上尉（Thomas），布鲁顿上尉（Bruton）和福鲁中尉（Flohr）到大队传令室向麦克拉夫林上尉报到。我们进去后，麦克拉夫林上尉就把门锁上。他取出几张离沙里院以南约十英里所在的几座小山的照片。照片上可以看出有些山上有铁道。
    译员：在沙里院的南部么？
    克：是的，大约离那里有十英里光景，上面还有几处空白点。他说这些空白点是炮位所在。现在我们要派你们去执行压制高射炮火的飞行任务。那里有个放大镜可以拿来看这几张照片。但我在看这几张照片时，我不能看出它像一个炮位或一尊炮。通常像这样的像片上如果有一尊炮或一个炮位的话，总可以看出来的。他命令我们在上午七时起飞，起飞后要上升到一万呎向目标进发。到目标上空时，从一万呎俯冲至六千呎，把炸弹投下，然后飞回到K—46基地。六点四十五分左右，我走向我的飞机去。在我到飞机处检验时，我看到在那里有穿着白色工作服，戴着面罩和手套的人员在装炸弹。这些人从一辆遮蔽着的卡车里把炸弹用手取出。通常他们必须用起重机把它们起出。可是这些炸弹是用手装的。我看了一看它们是否钩好，然后就走入飞机出发了。到了离沙里院以南约十英里的目标上空。那里有一条铁路，我们的目标就在铁道边上约一百呎光景。我们到达目标上空时是八点。我们俯冲至六千呎，然后把炸弹投下。我看见六个炸弹在空中爆炸，两个在到达地面时才爆炸。我们上升到一万呎后，飞回K—46，约九时着陆。我们到大队情报室向麦克拉夫林上尉报告道：“任务完成，结果未视察”，以后我们就去浴室淋浴。在浴室里，我向汤姆斯上尉说：“淋浴会把我身体洗干净，但我的心在我作了这事之后，将永远不会洗净。”我相信这样说是很明了的，我再也想不出用什么话来表示我当时那不痛快的心情。我知道其他的人也有同感，他们不像平常完成任务后那样高兴。我说他们高兴并不是说因为他们杀死了人，而是说他们在完成一次任务后常常谈天。他们会谈起这次任务如何险些被人射下等诸如此类的事。在那次他们都不谈什么，你可以从他们的这种态度看出他们非常不喜欢这次任务。次日晨八点，我们到大夫处，他检验了我们的血。
    四月二十九日是我的生日，我在酒吧间里小小地庆祝一下。喝了点酒，我有些兴奋，谈到了一般的政策。那时我正与我们十二中队里的大里欧中尉（Lieutenant Daleo）谈话，我抱怨生活条件等等，我谈到士气，谈到我们不喜欢朝鲜的一切，我是一般地指朝鲜战争。我特别提到细菌战，大致说有一次我不得不执行一次投掷细菌弹的任务，他说道，“不要觉得难过吧。”他自己也进行过细菌战，我知道大队中人人都在进行，可是我不知道他们执行那项任务是在什么时候。他告我说在一九五二年四月五日他和柯瑞中尉（Lieut．Curry）詹森中尉（Lieut．Jansen）和蓝达中尉（Lieut．Randall）在新安州南约五英里处扔下了八颗定时细菌弹。他并告诉我说，在一九五二年四月十五日，我们第十二战斗轰炸机中队的中队长克林中校在宣川以东五英里处扔下了两颗“不爆炸的炸弹”。五月五日晨九时左右，我在情报室看布告时，遇见格鲁中校走进来与麦克拉夫林上尉谈话。他刚完成一项任务归来。他说他在平壤附近投了两颗“不爆炸的炸弹”。一九五二年五月二十
    一日，我在营房里坐着，汤姆斯上尉过来告诉我说，第六十七战斗轰炸机中队的威廉斯中尉率领了四架飞机去军隅里。他们在那里扔了八颗定时细菌弹。
    这是我所晓得在朝鲜执行的投掷细菌弹任务的整个情形。显然，我知道我们大队所进行的比我刚才所说的还要多。不过我亲身看到和听到的就是这些。就麦克拉夫林上尉对我说话时的语气看来，我知道这种任务不止这几次。我很想向诸位表明，我相信我能够代表整个第十八战斗轰炸机大队全体同仁来说一句话，这些任务都不是心甘情愿地执行的。他们实际上确是被迫去干的，我自己知道我是不愿意的，我想我不愿意执行投细菌弹的任务并不特别。我只是一个普通的人，我知道其他的人们也同我一样是普通的人。他们对于这个战争中实际确在犯的其他不人道行为都感到憎厌了。比如凝固汽油弹轰炸啦，饱和轰炸啦。这不是和平，我的意思是说，这不像美国人民过去所从事的那种战争。
    译员：目前你所要说的就只这些了么？
    克：是的，关于细菌战，我所晓得的就只有这些。
    李约瑟（英国，下简称李）：那么，现在是提问题的时候了。
    茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫（苏联，下简称茹）：你是不是提到过细菌弹里面用疟疾原虫？
    克：对的，先生。像我在前面所说过的一样，那是麦克拉夫林上尉告诉我的。关于细菌战的任何部分，他从未详细地谈过，他只告诉我们一些以满足我们最低的好奇心罢了。
    欧利佛（意大利，下简称欧）：参加这些任务的驾驶员是否注射过他们所使用的那些细菌的预防针呢？
    克：是的，我就打过伤寒和疟疾预防针。我已打了无数次了。在未离开美国之先，我就打过三次鼠疫预防针。他们当时告诉我们说，在我们出国前，这已经够了。但是到了史东曼营地我们又打了三针。其中一针是伤寒，另外两针我不能断定是什么。不过我的意思是说在史东曼营地我们又另外打了预防针。
    马戴尔（法国，下简称马）：还有一点，你没有说你没有进过大学，我想知道你没有做驾驶员以前的经历？
    克：这问题是很容易回答的。我父亲整个一生大部分时间都是种田的，但他并没有地。他是个雇农。他一生的大部分时间都花费在地上。我的一生几乎多是住在伊里诺斯州的蒙茅斯地方（Monmouth，Ill.）。我在一个农庄上住了八年，其余的时间就住在伊里诺斯州的蒙茅斯和伊里诺斯州另一个小镇。前一个约有一万人口，后一个实在是一个小镇，只有一千左右的人口。
    译员：你说的后面这一个小镇叫什么名字？
    克：开司堡（Keithsburg）。我在这两个小镇里都上过学。在蒙茅斯读过一年半中学，因为我父亲筹不出学费，在一年半后便不得不辍学了。我穿的衣服是我感到不满意的，与别的学生在一起的时候，我想也许是由于自尊心，也许由于别的原故，随便你怎么说吧，我总不大愿意同他们来往。一九四四年当我的年龄刚达到标准时，我加入了海军。当时我比他们要求的最低年龄标准只过了三天。我在海军里干了两年。一九四六年五月我离开海军后，我仍找不到任何令我满意的工作。我没有任何上进的机会，这是因为我的缺乏教育与能力的原故，所以就在同年十二月进了空军。
    译员：四六年的十二月么？
    克：是的。
    李：马戴尔要继续询问么？
    李：马戴尔博士说，他一直觉得克尼斯先生如果有机会能够进大学的话，他一定会是一个好学生，因此他认为委员会可以问他各种技术方面的问题。我相信他会很好地回答这些问题的。
    李：好吧，假如目前没有人想提问题，我想乘这点空暇的时间问克尼斯先生，他在各次谈话中是否曾经听到暗示说，有一种降落伞附在纸制的容器上，这种容器有一种装备，能够在把它内部所藏的东西都放出去以后起火自焚，毁灭痕迹？
    克：没有。我从来没有听到像这样的事情。不过照他们目前这样费力想掩饰细菌战的情况看来，这是合乎逻辑的结论。在我看来，他们甚至会要把地上的任何证据都毁掉。我记得有一次他们告诉我们说，他们要使北朝鲜人民认为目前细菌武器在朝鲜所散布的各种疾病都说成是战争的必然产物。换句话说，供水系统遭受破坏等等诸如此类的事，比如说，生活水准下降了。但是我从没有听到像刚才所讲的事情，麦克拉夫林上尉当然决不会告诉我们；他只说里面有一个降落伞。
    欧：你说过当你们去检查炸弹时，他们告诉你们不要去摇动它们？
    克：是的。
    欧：你想那是不是因为炸弹的脆碎性或是这样做可能伤害了炸弹内部的虫类？
    克：照我个人的想法，那可能有很多理由，或者是因为炸弹的脆碎性，或者是恐怕伤害内部的细菌，我不知道那些细菌放在炸弹里面的什么地方，是怎样放进去的及在里面的情形怎样。另外一个理由是，我们绝对不希望炸弹落下弹架来。讲到这里我顺便提一提以前忘记向诸位说的一件事情。我们飞机每次执行任务回来总是要用蒸气消毒。这个事实可能证明炸弹外面也会有细菌，我想这不过是另外一个安全预防措施使得我们自己不与细菌接触。
    李：我不知道我可否接着以前的问题再问一下，就是说克尼斯先生是否听说过一种炸弹，或者应该说容器，是用一种非常非常脆而易碎的东西，像蛋壳一样的物质做成，它一接触地面，便裂成无数碎片，以致没有人能发现？
    克：没有，我从来没有听说过这种炸弹。但是我想他们是什么都做得出来的。我是说他们已经在朝鲜施用过这么许多不同的方法。在我和贝却敌（编者按：法国巴黎今晚报记者）先生谈话时，他告诉了我其中少数几种方法。但是他们为了掩盖他们的细菌战，这样事是干得出来的。就如我所说，驾驶员之间几乎绝对不谈论细菌战的。这也是很特别的，因为我认为美国人比任何一个民族要来得喜欢说话，他们很喜欢彼此谈谈的。但是这个话题，他们可真守起秘密来了。除了以上我提到的二次外，我就从没有听见驾驶员们提到过细菌战；除非只有
    他们二个人在一起，没有第三个人在跟前。
    但是，谈论细菌战是极严重的违纪行为，我意思说如果我们被人听见，一定要遭到非常严重的申
    斥。
    安德琳（瑞典，下简称安）：克尼斯先生是否知道炸弹是在那里制成的？你是否认为它们在美国就制造好，满装了小动物，昆虫和细菌，然后运来
    的？
    克：这些炸弹是从那里来的问题，我不能正确回答。不过我肯定地知道一件事：原州只有一个小型的军火库，他们不会有这种设备的。我知道这种炸弹不是在那里做的。因为我认为制造这种炸弹和装细菌等等工作，需要相当多的仪器机件才行。
    安：你看这些动物，昆虫和细菌从美国运来到使用需要多少时间，在容器内需要放多久？
    克：从美国运来用不着多少时间，三十六小时吧。这是我从美国飞到日本所需的时间。我意思说他们把细菌等从美国空运到朝鲜所需的时间和我从美国来日本一样。我是乘DC—6式机来的，他们可用另一种飞机运送，我相信他们会用C—97，那就更快了。我的意思是这些细菌等不必保存在弹内太久。
    安：还有一个有关的问题。在我看来，在美国填装，再运送过来，加上等待使用的时间，时间还是长了一点。你有没有想到在日本有一个制造基地的可能？
    克：是的，我的意思说，美军在日本有许多很大的基地是大家知道的事实。像立川基地是我看见过的最大基地之一。我到过那里二次：一次是到朝鲜来的时候，另一次是去度假休养。但是我只见到整个基地的一部分而已。我这是说，这基地非常大，很可能他们就在那里从事这项工作，因为我们的飞机就是到那里去装置细菌喷射器的。我是说它们很可能就是在立川制造的。那里也同时是空用物资司令部基地（Air Material Command Base），也就是说一个大供应基地。我想它大约有十五英里长，这便可估计它确实有多大了。
    马：你说你的同伴中凡是参加细菌战的都憎厌他们的行为。你有把握认为你的观察是正确吗？你似乎了解社会的不公平，可是你的同伴们在这一点上有和你一样的认识吗？
    克：是的，我可说我对人的观察在百分之九十以上的情况是正确的。不错，有少数人来自比我好的环境，他们的家庭比我的富裕。但是这不是大多数人都如此。K—46基地的大部分驾驶员是重征入伍的。我是说他们不是你们所说的那种正规军人。他们大多数终身都是工人。我认为我有相当把握来这样说。你往往可从小事情来看人；从他们的反应来看。我觉得人们这样想的，我知道得很不少。
    马：你能作正确的、锐利的观察。你实际上做过什么工作来试验他们的反应呢？
    克：一次便是我前面所说我所参加的那次任务执行归来后的反应，我是说大家的态度。平常我们执行一次任务回来，总归要说一句“你看见我险一些就被打下来吗？”这一类话。平常大家总开善意的玩笑，像我以前说过的，并不是他们对任务感到高兴，即使是在最不快的时候，你也总得找点事来说句笑话。但是现在大家极为不满，他们心中不快。上次大战时，我也在海外，但是士气与现在在南朝鲜的人们不同，与第二次世界大战时相比，我们的士气天差地远，我是说，就士气而论，是无法相比的。今天驾驶员不像上次大战的驾驶员那样愿意牺牲他们的生命。今天大多数驾驶员都有一个印象，就是早日完成一百次的任务，然后回家去。我认为他们不愿牺牲生命这一点，对我说来，很明显地可以看出，他们不相信他们的事业。他们反对那个使他们目前被驱使的理由。
    马：参加细菌战任务的驾驶员们在任务完成后是否都喝大量的酒呢？
    克：是的，过度喝酒便是我在K—46和K—10——我们使用的两个基地——所注意到的一件事。我相信一个人在喝酒的时候比在不喝酒的时候更容易现出一个人的真面目来。普通讲来，在美国当一个驾驶员喝了酒，有些兴奋，他们是快乐的，他们总是想有点乐趣或作些小恶作剧。可是这里的驾驶员们则不然。他们闷闷不乐，时常打架。在美国时我在军官俱乐部里看到的打架没有超过两次，可是在K—46和K—10，打架是常有的事。
    马：那些驾驶员有无觉得他们是在参加非正义的战争？或者他们是否像在二次大战中一样为了神圣的事业而在作战？
    克：不，我相信多数驾驶员的意见是这次战争与上次的战争之间的不同有如昼夜之别。就如我以前所说过的，另外一个理由便是人们简直不愿为国而牺牲。他们不热心。他们只是在敷衍塞责。我曾听说过有飞行员故意错过目标的事——我们的主要目标是铁道。我自己就好多次是这样的——我曾在碰到猛烈的高射炮火时中止攻击。这种事在上次大战中从未有过，就如我所说过的，这些人们只想完成他们的百次任务后回家。很容易看出，他们的心并不在战争里，但是他们不愿出来表示反对政府。美国军队的纪律规定不能发表声明反对政府。
    马：驾驶员们不愿参战是一般的感觉呢还是由于这次战争是非正义的战争而产生的一种感觉呢？
    克：我相信那是由于不正义战争所产生的一种感觉，我的意思是指我们作战的方法，投掷凝固汽油弹，目标往往总是朝鲜的民房或类似的所在。很明显的可以看出这不是军事目标。凡有头脑的人，便可自己懂得这个道理。
    开城停战谈判是使人们感到不满的另外一件事。假如我国如此需要和平的话，我们为何不在开城获致停战呢？为什么要继续战争，继续使双方人民受到死伤？为什么使这不必要的屠杀延长下去？还有细菌战，我们的政策原是说要拯救朝鲜免于共产主义传染，这是说我们要救人民，使他们得到民主。但是你决不能把要救的人杀死。你决不能使用大规模屠杀的方法。那就是法西斯主义了。
    另外一个例子便是用扫射办法不必要地杀伤人民。我们向目标俯冲时，我们往往用机枪扫射，这对地面上的炮手——如果地面上有炮之类的话——起一种心理作用，使他们不敢抬头向我们开火。我们轰炸铁路时，我们常常把容易轰炸的地方的一整段直线路轨切断。假如在那段路轨上有一个小镇的话，把那个小镇加以扫射也无所谓。对于什么规矩道理之类是完全不讲的。这是一个全面战争。毁坏一切就是实际政策。
    另外还有一个我亲身知道的例子就是大队所进行的凝固汽油弹轰炸。我虽未亲自参加，但我曾与进行这种轰炸后回来的人员谈过，当我站着谈得正热闹的时候有一人过来说道：“你们看见我向那建筑物投下炸弹么？那地方看去好像是一个学校”，我还记得另外一个人的一句话：“那不是很可骄傲的事么！？”这对那个人说，是非常讽刺的话。可是那谈话也就中止在那里了。
    我看见过影片中驾驶员受到申斥的情况。我们每隔两三天便就放映我们作战的照片。每当放机枪时，银幕上便出现了一只手来指出你是否在放机枪。我看到过他们因为放得不够而受到申斥。我看到他们的飞机下来越过了一所房子或一个地方，机枪如果停止放射，那只手就缩上去了。我亲身看到过有人因为没有放枪而受到申斥的。
    李：现在我还要问一个最后的问题。我们现在离细菌战的题太远了，但是这是很有兴趣的，而且从进行细菌战的总背景来看，这也是值得研究的。关于最后的叙述中使我最感兴趣的是，用我的话来说，那些驾驶员已经对这种情况“感到了厌倦”。上面所说的，还是方法问题。现在我想要问的，是宣传问题怎么样。我是说，他们对于他们不得不采用的方法彻头彻尾感到憎厌，但在这战事开始时就有许多关于联合国性质的宣传，关于集体安全以及诸如此类的种种宣传，西方国家只有少数的人——如果不是少数人至少绝不是每个人都识破这种宣传，认识到事情的所有其他方面。所以我所要问的是——我不知是否已经说清楚了——真的只有极少数甚至没有现役军人被那宣传所欺，真正感觉到所有联合国的宣传实在是一件侵略的外衣，非亚洲国家支配亚洲的外衣。我的意思很难完全表达清楚，可是我希望我已把它说清了。
    克：是的，从一个在朝鲜进行过细菌战并且在实际上参加了朝鲜战争的人的观点来看，他们由各方面看清楚了这一点。人们出去轰炸建筑——这里我所谓的建筑即是朝鲜人民所造和住的土房。他们去执行这种任务，回来报告说毁坏了许多建筑。我们大队出有一种公报，往往贴在大队传令室的布告板上。在这些公报上的消息说，许多兵营被光荣的第十八战斗轰炸机大队给炸毁了。事情便是那样。他们从不发布事实说炸毁了许多民房而说炸毁了兵营。只有切断铁路他们才说实话，说空军第十八大队今日完成了十次切断铁路的轰炸。他们从不说他们轰炸那里，轰炸的是一个市镇或是其他地方，例如轰炸平壤，或新安州，或其他城市时，他们总有一个目标在那城里的。他们不是要毁坏城里的一切，他们是有特殊目标的。特殊目标是他们爱用的一个词。驾驶员们从两方面看穿了这一点，那便是他们出去做一件事，而公报上消息却是完全另外一件事。美国人民要在这些谎话中确切辨出真相是困难的，促成他们真正听到真相的巨大因素是从朝鲜回来告诉他们事实真相的人们。
    欧：你曾否想到你为细菌战作证会使得你在美国的家庭受到报复？我知道你是结过婚的。但我不知你是否有孩子，或者当你回去时，军队方面或当局方面可能采取对你不利的行动。我们知道目下美国的情形如何。不知你曾否想到这一点？
    克：是的，我想到的。我想的相当多。可是对于这些问题我只好把信心寄托于人类。我没有孩子。不过假如他们对我妻子、父母或家庭其他成员有所报复的话，他们这样做只有承认他们犯了采取这种战事方法的罪恶了。不过我对美国人民有足够的信仰，在这我所指的是像我一样的一般美国老百姓，他们不会让我家庭和妻子发生什么不幸的。至于我本人，他们也许会采取某种报复手段。不过照道理上讲来，美国人民会百分之百地支持我的。假如他们不是这样的话，我觉得一个人总应该站稳立场而斗争，决不能被征服，放下武器，或很顺从地接受命运。我们必须斗争。有些人也许牺牲要大些，但我决不担心这个。我知道美国人民是会支持我的，除非我把这些事实证明清楚，我是决不罢休也不会觉得安心的。
    李：现在，假如没有其他问题的话，我觉得我们应结束这次的询问了。我想，像在其他场合下，一般克尼斯先生也许说句最后的话。你有什么别的话要说的么？
    克：有的，我愿意说几句最后的话来结束。我能与诸位先生谈话深感荣幸。我愿这些消息能使美国全体人民知道，能使全世界的人民都知道。这是美国少数人不顾及美国生活方式或其他生活方式而盗用美国人民所犯的罪行。我本人曾参加反法西斯战争。我的兄弟已在这个战争中牺牲。我实在不愿再看到另一次世界大战。可是我感到现在实在是在走向那条路上去。他们目前的行为正说明了他们为了要独霸世界会干出什么事来。我认为最好的阻止它的办法就是在它没有真正开始以前阻止它。我相信在座诸位先生也正为这供献很多，也许我所提供的
    一点点作证，有助于补偿我所犯的一些错误和其他驾驶员在犯的一些错误，这也是为了美国的人民。我知道，我希望我妻子儿女生活在一个和平的世界里，我不希望将来我儿子们再作战。
    我愿在此再向诸位道谢，并请求你们把你们在朝鲜所收集的种种罪行的材料和证据尽可能广泛地使全世界真正明白朝鲜战事究竟是怎么一回事，我的意思是朝鲜战争决不是拯救世界而是攫夺全世界。
    李：还有其他的问题么？我想我该代表委员会向克尼斯先生衷心道谢，因为他很合作，正确，镇静而清楚地揭露了我们非常重视的一切。同时我愿向他保证，本委员会将毫不犹疑的在最近将来把它公布出来，使全世界每一个人都知道有什么事已经在开始了，它在将来会有怎么样的不可估计的危险。         （新华社）
