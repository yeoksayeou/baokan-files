    People of Ongniud Banner, Rehe Province
    Thank Chairman Mao for Bringing Them a Happy Life
    Dear Chairman Mao: From August 7th to 11th, the people of our Ongniud Banner held a grand third horse racing and livestock competition on the vast grassland. The Central Delegation you sent crossed mountains and deserts, traveling thousands of miles to participate. The people of our entire banner are sincerely grateful for your concern. We extend to you our highest and most affectionate respects, and promise to redouble our efforts to complete this year's patriotic livestock breeding and protection movement plan.
    In the years since liberation, under your leadership, the people of all ethnic groups in our Ongniud Banner have transformed from slaves into masters, from poverty to prosperity. The banner has witnessed tremendous development in all aspects of construction, including politics, economy, and culture. Our cattle herds have increased by 50% compared to the highest level under the puppet Manchukuo regime; the people's purchasing power has increased by 60% this year compared to 1950; and the number of Mongolian schools is twelve times greater than under the puppet Manchukuo. Our bodies are getting stronger and stronger, and the population is increasing year by year, with many households achieving "prosperity in both people and livestock." The backward, ignorant, and animal-like life is gone forever. Your great brilliance will forever shine on the grassland, and the grassland will always be free and happy. For a better future—a socialist and communist society—we are determined to follow you forever and advance in the direction you have indicated!

    热河省翁牛特旗人民
    感谢毛主席带给他们幸福的生活
    亲爱的毛主席：从八月七日到十一日，我们翁牛特旗人民在辽阔的草原上举行了盛大的第三届赛马比畜大会。您派来的中央访问团越过了高山，穿过了沙漠，不远千里赶来参加。我们全旗人民对您的关怀衷心感激。我们向您致以最崇高、最亲切的敬礼，并保证百倍努力地完成今年爱国增畜保畜运动的计划。
    解放几年来，我们翁牛特旗各族各界人民在您的领导下，由奴隶变成了主人，由贫困走向了富裕。全旗无论在政治、经济、文化各方面的建设事业上，都有了巨大的发展。我们的牛群比伪满最高水平增加了百分之五十；人民的购买力今年就比一九五○年提高了百分之六十；蒙民学校比伪满时多了十二倍。我们身体越来越壮，人口逐年增加，许多户做到“人畜两旺”。落后愚昧、牛马般的生活一去不复返了。您伟大的光辉永远照耀着草原，草原永远是自由幸福的。为着更美好的将来——社会主义和共产主义社会，我们坚决永远跟着您走，朝着您所指示的方向前进！
