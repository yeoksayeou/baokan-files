Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 28th: At the plenary session of the delegation of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations on the 28th, the other side claimed that it was willing to achieve a solution to the issue of prisoner repatriation on the basis of meeting the demands of both sides to a reasonable extent. However, the other side still insisted on the absurd principle of detaining prisoners of war under the so-called "no forced repatriation," and proposed three so-called different plans that had no new content in substance at all for refusing to repatriate our captured personnel to our side. It suggested adjourning the meeting for ten days and resuming on October 8th. General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side, pointed out that our side has consistently strived to achieve a Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis. However, in the other side's so-called three different plans, our side could not find any element that could substantially meet the reasonable demands of both sides. The other side is merely using different forms and methods to decorate its consistent unreasonable demands. General Nam Il solemnly pointed out that the current dispute between the two sides on the issue of prisoner repatriation is a matter of principle, which cannot be obscured by any tricks of playing with forms and methods. No matter what name is borrowed, the proposition of detaining prisoners of war cannot be tolerated. The issue of prisoner repatriation must be resolved in accordance with the 1949 Geneva Convention and the provisions for prisoner repatriation in the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides. Our side's principle of repatriating prisoners of war to return home to live a peaceful life is fully in line with the Geneva Convention and the provisions for prisoner repatriation in the draft armistice agreement. Contrary to the other side's practice of never making any substantial concessions on the issue of prisoner repatriation, our side has made a series of major efforts on the issue of prisoner repatriation in order to seek a fair and reasonable armistice. On July 18th, our side put forward a plan for the concrete implementation of the principle of repatriating prisoners of war to return home to live a peaceful life. This concrete plan of our side is itself a plan that substantially meets the reasonable demands of both sides, and only this concrete plan of our side truly meets the demands of both sides to a reasonable extent. General Nam Il finally pointed out that according to Articles 51 and 52 of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, prisoners of war must be repatriated home to live a peaceful life. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers insist on this absolutely fair and reasonable principle. For the benefit of the Korean armistice, General Nam Il once again suggested that the other side reconsider its fundamental position, and in order to facilitate the other side's consideration of its position, agreed to the other side's suggestion to adjourn the meeting for ten days.

The full text of the speech by General Nam Il, the chief representative of our side, is as follows:

	In the spirit of our side's consistent efforts to achieve a Korean armistice on a fair and reasonable basis, we have carefully studied your side's speech this morning and the three different plans you put forward in this speech. I cannot but point out that we cannot find anything in any of the three different plans you have put forward that is substantially sufficient to meet the reasonable demands of both sides. You are merely using different forms and methods to decorate your side's consistently unreasonable demands. It must be pointed out that the current dispute between the two sides on the issue of prisoner repatriation is a matter of principle, which cannot be concealed by any tricks of playing with forms and methods. No matter what name is borrowed, the proposition of detaining prisoners of war cannot be tolerated. The issue of prisoner repatriation must be resolved in accordance with Articles 51 and 52 of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides. Our side's principle of repatriating prisoners of war to return home to live a peaceful life is fully in line with Articles 51 and 52 of the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement. Contrary to your side's failure to make any substantial concessions on the issue of prisoner repatriation, our side has made a series of major efforts on the issue of prisoner repatriation in order to seek a fair and reasonable armistice, and put forward the plan of July 18th for the concrete implementation of the principle of repatriating prisoners of war to return home to live a peaceful life. I have repeatedly reiterated that our side's plan of July 18th is itself a plan that substantially meets the reasonable demands of both sides. Now I want to repeat that only our side's plan of July 18th truly meets the demands of both sides to a reasonable extent. For the benefit of the Korean armistice, I once again propose that your side reconsider your fundamental position. According to Articles 51 and 52 of the 1949 Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement already agreed upon by both sides, prisoners of war must be repatriated home to live a peaceful life, which is absolutely fair and reasonable. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers insist on this absolutely fair and reasonable principle. In order to facilitate your side's reconsideration of your fundamental position, I agree to your side's suggestion to adjourn the meeting for ten days.

On the 28th, General Nam Il also lodged a strong protest with the other side regarding the incident on September 26th in which the U.S. side again wounded four of our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island. The full text of the protest is as follows: To Lieutenant General Harrison, Chief Representative of the United Nations Command Delegation:

	On September 26th, your side again wounded four of our captured personnel in the prisoner of war camp on Jeju Island. I strongly protest against this to you. For the shameful purpose of detaining prisoners of war, your side has continuously and wantonly abused and killed our captured personnel. In the past week alone, your side has massacred our captured personnel four times, killing and wounding sixty-three people. Your side has not yet given any explanation for the bloody incidents of massacring our captured personnel on previous occasions. It must be solemnly pointed out that cowardly silence can never absolve your side of the full responsibility it must bear for the war crimes of abusing and killing prisoners of war and completely undermining the Geneva Convention.

    美方玩弄新花样掩饰扣留战俘的荒谬主张
    我方要对方重新考虑其根本立场
    并严重抗议对方打伤济州岛我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，对方声称：愿在合理程度内满足双方要求的基础上，取得遣俘问题的解决。但对方却仍然坚持所谓“不得强迫遣返”的扣留战俘的荒谬原则，提出在实质上根本没有任何新的内容的所谓三种不同的拒绝遣返我方被俘人员至我方的方案，并建议休会十天，到十月八日再行复会。我方首席代表南日将军指出：我方一贯努力在公平合理的基础上达成朝鲜停战。但在对方的所谓三种不同的方案中，我方不能发现有任何在实质上能满足双方合理要求的成分。对方只是用不同的形式和方法来装饰对方一贯坚持的无理要求。南日将军严正指出：目前双方在遣俘问题上的争执是一个原则问题，决不是任何玩弄形式和方法的花样所能加以抹煞。不管假借什么名义，扣留战俘的主张是不能被容许的。遣俘问题必须按照一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方已经同意的停战协定草案的遣俘条款，加以解决。我方遣返战俘回家过和平生活的原则完全符合于日内瓦公约和停战协定草案的遣俘条款。和对方在遣俘问题上从未作过任何实质让步的作法相反，我方为了求得一个公平合理的停战，在遣俘问题上作了一系列的重大努力。在七月十八日我方提出了具体实施遣返战俘回家过和平生活的原则的方案。我方这一具体方案本身，就是一个在实质上满足双方合理要求的方案，也只有我方这一具体方案才是真正在合理程度上满足双方要求的方案。南日将军最后指出：按照一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方已经同意的停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款，战俘必须被遣返回家过和平生活。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚持这个绝对公平合理的原则。为了朝鲜停战的利益，南日将军再次建议对方重新考虑其根本立场，并为便于对方考虑其立场，同意对方休会十天的建议。
    我方首席代表南日将军发言全文如下：
    本着我方一贯努力在公平合理的基础上达成朝鲜停战的诚意，我们仔细地研究了你方今天上午的发言和你方在这一发言中所提出的三种不同的方案。我不能不指出：我们不能从你方提出的三种不同方案中的任何一个方案里，发现有任何在实质上足以满足双方合理要求的东西。你们只是用不同的形式和方法来装饰你方一贯坚持的无理要求。必须指出：目前双方在遣俘问题上的争执是一个原则问题，决不是任何玩弄形式和方法上的花样所能掩盖的。不管假借什么名义，扣留战俘的主张是不能被容许的。遣俘问题必须按照一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方已经同意的停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款加以解决。我方遣返战俘回家过和平生活的原则，是完全符合于日内瓦公约和停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款的。和你方在遣俘问题上从未作过任何实质让步相反，我方为了求得一个公平合理的停战，在遣俘问题上作了一系列的重大努力，提出了七月十八日具体实施遣返战俘回家过和平生活的原则的方案。我曾经不断重复过我方七月十八日方案本身就是一个在实质上满足双方合理要求的方案。现在我还要重复，只有我方七月十八日的方案才是真正在合理程度上满足双方要求的方案。为了朝鲜停战的利益，我再一次提议你方重新考虑你方的根本立场。按照一九四九年日内瓦公约和双方已经同意的停战协定草案第五十一款和第五十二款，战俘必须被遣返回家过和平生活，这是绝对公平合理的。朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚持这个绝对公平合理的原则。为了便于你方重新考虑你方的根本立场，我同意你方休会十天的建议。
    二十八日南日将军并就九月二十六日美方又在济州岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员四人的事件向对方提出严重抗议。抗议全文如下：联合国军代表团首席代表哈利逊中将：
    九月二十六日你方又在济州岛战俘营打伤我方被俘人员四人。对此我向你提出严重抗议。你方为了扣留战俘的可耻目的，连续不断地恣意虐杀我方被俘人员。只在上一星期内，你方就四次屠杀我方被俘人员，打死打伤六十三人。你方对于历次屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事件，至今未作任何交代。必须严正指出：卑怯的沉默，绝不能卸脱你方对于虐杀战俘、彻底破坏日内瓦公约的战争罪行所必须担负的完全责任。
    朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表团
    首席代表南日将军
