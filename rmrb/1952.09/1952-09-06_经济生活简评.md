Economic Life Commentary

Learn a Lesson from the Capital Construction of the Shanghai Motor Factory

The new construction project of the Shanghai Motor Factory is a prominent example of failure caused by treating capital construction work with an extremely unserious attitude. The "Provisional Measures for Capital Construction Work" once stipulated that a comprehensive study and calculation of the design object should be made during the preliminary design, and the technical possibilities and economic rationality should be fully estimated. Detailed investigations should be made on economic and technical data; otherwise, design should not be carried out rashly. The purpose of these regulations is to avoid blindness in capital construction and errors and waste in design, so that our capital construction projects can meet the needs of national long-term construction.

However, up to now, there are still some leading cadres in industrial and mining enterprises, and even responsible cadres in relatively high-level leading organs, who, like the leading cadres of the Shanghai Motor Factory, believe that capital construction is very simple, just "building a few houses," factory buildings plus machines; with money, capital construction work can be done well. They regard the plan task book only as a perfunctory formality to deal with superiors and request appropriations. In this way, of course, there is no question of carrying out thorough investigation and research. The result of construction based on these plans without thorough investigation and research is bound to be failure. Therefore, the fact that the new construction project of the Shanghai Motor Factory could not complete the progress indicators on schedule, that the factory design was completely divorced from reality, and that it caused a large backlog and loss of funds and materials is not an accidental fault, nor is it an isolated special event. It shows that some enterprise leading cadres, until today, have not recognized that capital construction is an important work related to China's industrialization, and they have not seriously studied this work with painstaking effort, but have treated it with a bureaucratic attitude.

The lesson of the Shanghai Motor Factory should attract the attention of industrial and mining enterprises in various regions, and they should immediately change their erroneous views and treat capital construction work with a serious attitude.

    记取上海电机厂基本建设的教训
    上海电机厂新建工程，是以极不严肃的态度对待基本建设工作而招致失败的突出的例子。“基本建设工作暂行办法”曾经规定，在初步设计时，要对设计对象作通盘的研究与计算，要充分估计到技术上的可能性与经济上的合理性，要对经济及技术的资料作详确的调查，否则不得草率设计。这些规定的目的，在于避免基本建设中的盲目性和设计上的错误及浪费现象，使我们的基本建设工程都能符合国家长期建设的需要。
    但是，到目前为止，还有一些工矿企业的领导干部，甚至比较高级领导机关的负责干部，他们还和上海电机厂领导干部一样，认为基本建设很简单，只不过是“盖几间房子”，是厂房加机器；有了钱就能把基本建设工作做好。他们把计划任务书只当作应付上级、要求拨款的官样文章。这样，当然也就谈不到要进行周密的调查研究工作了。根据这些没有周密调查研究而作出的计划方案进行建设的结果，其失败乃是必然的。因此，上海电机厂新建工程不能按期完成进度指标，工厂设计完全脱离实际情况，并造成大量资财的积压和损失，这就不是偶然的过错，也不是个别的特殊事件了。它说明了某些企业领导干部，直到今天还没有认清基本建设工作乃是关系着我国工业化的一项重要工作，他们也还没有认真的下苦心的去钻研这一项工作，而是以官僚主义的态度去对待它。
    上海电机厂的教训，应该引起各地工矿企业部门的注意，即速改变错误的观点，以严肃的态度对待基本建设工作。
