Achievements of Nationalities Work in the Past Three Years
By Liu Geping, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the implementation of Chairman Mao's nationalities policy has yielded brilliant achievements throughout the country. The patriotic political consciousness of all nationalities has been enhanced, and the fraternal relations of equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation among them have been further consolidated. All nationalities, united in the great family of the motherland, have achieved unprecedented and remarkable development in political, economic, and cultural fields, and the lives of all nationalities have been improved day by day.

First, the equal rights of all nationalities have been realized, and the policy of national regional autonomy has been promoted. On August 9th of this year, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy in the People's Republic of China," which is a summary of the implementation of the policy of national regional autonomy over the past three years. As of June 1952, 130 national autonomous regions had been established, some equivalent to special districts or counties, and some equivalent to districts or townships. National regional autonomy has also been implemented in the areas where some ethnic minorities with small populations, such as the Oroqen in Inner Mongolia and the Bonan in the Northwest, live in concentrated communities. The promotion of the policy of national regional autonomy has strengthened national unity, stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of all ethnic minorities, and promoted various tasks in the local areas, thereby rapidly changing the face of social life of ethnic minorities in all aspects.

In order to safeguard the equal rights of ethnic minorities in areas where various ethnic groups live together, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated a decision on the implementation of methods for local national democratic joint governments. As of June 1952, more than 200 national democratic joint governments had been established. The implementation of this system enables representatives of all ethnic groups in areas where ethnic minorities live together to participate in the local government work in appropriate numbers. This meets the requirements of ethnic minorities in areas where ethnic groups live together to participate in the government, thereby strengthening national unity.

For some ethnic minorities scattered among the Han people or other ethnic residents, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government promulgated a decision on safeguarding the equal rights of all scattered ethnic minority components, fully guaranteeing that they enjoy the same freedoms and rights as the Han people or other ethnic groups who constitute the majority of the local population, and prohibiting all acts of discrimination or insult against them.

The Central People's Government so effectively safeguards the political equality of all nationalities, which enables all ethnic minorities in the country to closely unite in the great family of the People's Republic of China, and to demonstrate unprecedented high enthusiasm and great strength for defending the motherland, building the motherland, and creating a happy and fulfilling life.

Secondly, a large number of minority nationality cadres have been trained widely. With the advancement of nationality work and the development of construction undertakings in minority nationality areas, the need for minority nationality cadres is becoming increasingly urgent. In order to cultivate minority nationality cadres extensively and in large quantities, as early as November 1950, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a pilot program for cultivating minority nationality cadres and a pilot program for preparing for the establishment of the Central Institute for Nationalities. In the past three years, in addition to boldly using and promoting minority nationality cadres in their work, all localities have also generally run various training classes for minority nationality cadres and schools for minority nationality cadres. The Central Institute for Nationalities was established in Beijing, and eight branch institutes of the Central Institute for Nationalities were established in the Northwest, Southwest, and Central South. The ethnic composition of these minority nationality cadres includes all nationalities in the country. The students who graduated from the Central Institute for Nationalities and its branch institutes alone included more than 60 nationalities.

In order to encourage and help minority nationality students receive higher education and general education, minority nationality students who apply for colleges and secondary schools are given priority for admission. Therefore, in the past three years, many minority nationality students have entered colleges and secondary schools.

While training minority nationality cadres, governments at all levels have also dispatched necessary Han nationality cadres to work in minority nationality areas. These Han nationality cadres generally establish close cooperative relations with local ethnic cadres and masses, enthusiastically serve the people of ethnic minorities, and play a significant role in the development of various tasks in ethnic minority areas.

Thirdly, trade work has been carried out in minority nationality areas, and agricultural and pastoral production has been restored and developed. In the past three years, the People's Government has established state-owned trade organizations in vast minority nationality areas, and has set up state-owned trade company stores, purchasing stations, consignment stores and other business organizations and a large number of mobile trade groups according to different situations. These trade organizations, according to fair and reasonable price policies, and sometimes especially increasing the prices of local products, purchase large quantities of local products from minority nationality areas, and supply daily necessities. Therefore, the exchange ratio of local products and industrial products has undergone unprecedented changes. For example, in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, before liberation, every hundred catties of gallnut could only be exchanged for 22 catties and 13 taels of edible salt, but now it can be exchanged for 76 catties and 13 taels of edible salt. In Xinjiang, before liberation, 1,794 catties of wheat or 119 catties of wool were required to exchange for a bolt of Yanta cloth, but in the first half of this year, only 237 catties of wheat or 32 catties of wool were required.

The scope of business of state-owned trade organizations in ethnic minority areas is also expanding day by day. According to incomplete statistics from the Northwest District Company of the China Livestock Products Company, in the first half of this year, it purchased more than 4.86 million catties of wool in Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces alone, an increase of 60.37% compared to the same period last year. In the process of expanding their operations, state-owned trade companies in various regions have also organized and led the production of local and special products in ethnic minority areas, helped ethnic minorities improve the quality and specifications of their products, and enabled many local and special products in ethnic minority areas to develop and gain broad sales channels. For example, the processed wool exported from Xinjiang last year averaged only 75% to 85% in compliance with international standards, but this year, the first batch of Mongolian wool and Kuche wool exported after processing exceeded international standards. In the Southwest, the number of local and special products sold outside ethnic minority areas has increased from the original 23 to more than 150.

In order to meet the needs of trade in ethnic minority areas, trade administrative agencies and state-owned trade enterprises in many regions have also promoted and guided private merchants to conduct trade in ethnic minority areas, and at the same time helped ethnic minorities to engage in commerce - restoring and establishing regular markets. Under the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also widely developed cooperative undertakings.

Now, the products of ethnic minority areas and all parts of the country have been widely circulated. Lhasa merchants carrying fritillaria, caterpillar fungus, musk, pulu and other Tibetan native products have arrived in Lijiang County in northwestern Yunnan and Xiahe County (i.e. Labrang) in Gansu. In the Labrang market, aluminum pots from Shanghai, porcelain from Jiangxi, and ivory carvings from Guangzhou can be bought at any time. And in Shanghai and Guangzhou, dried Hami melons and raisins from Xinjiang can also be bought at any time.

In order to help ethnic minorities restore and develop agricultural production, the People's Government has helped them reclaim wasteland to expand arable land area in ethnic minority agricultural areas, built water conservancy projects to prevent disasters, and changed soil quality, advocated intensive cultivation and fine farming, provided technical guidance to increase yield per unit area, and issued loans to help ethnic minorities tide over famines and solve the problem of lack of production funds. Now, agriculture in ethnic minority areas has made great progress. Yield per unit area has generally increased by 10% to 100%, and in some cases as much as 300% to 400%. The People's Government has also established state-owned farms in some ethnic minority areas, and through these farms, it guides ethnic minority farmers with advanced farming methods. Under the guidance of state-owned farms, the people of the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region have proposed a plan to increase grain production by 2,000 tons this year.

The People's Government has also done a lot of work to help ethnic minorities develop animal husbandry. Generally, attention is paid to guiding the rational use of grasslands among various ethnic groups and tribes in pastoral areas, and loans are provided to help herdsmen store grass for the winter, mobilize herdsmen to build livestock sheds, improve breeding methods, and vigorously prevent and control animal diseases. In areas lacking grass and water, herdsmen are mobilized to cultivate pasture and dig wells. In addition, livestock breeding is promoted in pastoral areas and livestock breeds are improved with emphasis. The number of livestock has now increased significantly in the Northwest Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where animal husbandry occupies an important position in the economy. The number of livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has nearly doubled compared to when it was liberated in 1945.

Other various production undertakings, such as handicrafts, forestry, and various sideline occupations, have also been greatly developed. Some regions, such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang, have also begun the construction of modern industry.

On the issue of social reform, the People's Government has adopted a prudent and steady approach, based on the wishes of the majority of the people in ethnic minority areas and leaders who are connected with the people, and mainly through their own efforts. Under this approach, many ethnic minority agricultural areas have implemented rent reduction and deposit refunds, and some areas have also implemented land reform. In pastoral areas, because the management of animal husbandry is capitalistic in nature, a policy of benefiting both herd owners and herders is implemented, while gradually abolishing the feudal privileges of herd owners and encouraging their production enthusiasm to develop the livestock economy.

Fourthly, the development of culture, education, and health undertakings.

In the past, due to diseases, the mortality rate of ethnic minority populations was very high, and the population of many ethnic minorities has been decreasing in recent decades. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of diseases is a very urgent requirement for all ethnic minorities.

In response to this urgent need of ethnic minorities, the Central People's Government has actively carried out national health work, and has allocated a total of more than 109.2 billion yuan in subsidies for health undertakings in ethnic minority areas. By the beginning of 1952, 187 county health centers and county health stations had been restored and established in the counties where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. In addition, many health centers and health stations have also been established in counties where ethnic groups live together.

In order to strengthen national health work, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and local health agencies have sent more than 50 health teams to ethnic minority areas in the Northwest Region, Southwest Region, Central South Region, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to provide free treatment for ethnic minorities. Medical personnel of the People's Liberation Army who entered ethnic minority areas also enthusiastically treated ethnic minority people. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government immediately dispatched medical work teams to Tibet and allocated dozens of billions of yuan for medical expenses for the Tibetan people. These mobile health teams and medical teams overcame various difficulties, went deep into the grasslands, reached the borders, and revived the dying in vast ethnic minority areas, and were warmly welcomed by all ethnic minority people. In addition to treating diseases in various regions, they also conducted health publicity and vigorously promoted maternal and child health work.

The People's Government, based on the epidemic situation in ethnic minority areas, particularly emphasized the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases. Under this approach, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has universally established institutions for the prevention and treatment of plague. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xikang Tibetan Autonomous Region have established venereal disease prevention and treatment centers. Yunnan Province and Guizhou Province have established malaria prevention and treatment stations. This focused prevention and treatment work has achieved great results. For example, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the plague, which was widely prevalent in the past, has now been almost completely eliminated, and about 70% of syphilis patients have been cured after treatment. According to a survey in Chen Barag Banner from January to May 1951, the infant birth rate in the banner increased by 79% compared to the same period in 1950.

The People's Government has also helped ethnic minorities develop education. Education in some areas has become quite popular, such as the Northeast Korean nationality, where the enrollment rate of children of school age has reached about 92%. The number of schools in some areas has developed rapidly, such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, where the number of primary schools has increased more than three times compared to the highest number during the Japanese imperialist rule. Some ethnic groups that had no schools at all in the past, such as the Oroqen, now have their own schools. Some areas, such as Xinjiang and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, not only have primary schools and secondary schools, but also have universities. Some regions, such as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Xinjiang, have also launched mass winter school movements.

The Central People's Government attaches importance to the development of the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities. Therefore, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council has specially established the "Guidance Committee for the Study of Ethnic Minority Languages and Scripts" to be responsible for guiding and organizing research on ethnic minority languages and scripts, helping to create scripts where there are none, and helping to improve scripts that are incomplete. The creation of the new Yi script in Xikang Yi Autonomous Region is the beginning of this work. The People's Government has also made full use of existing conditions to vigorously develop the publishing industry in ethnic minority languages. The Nationalities Affairs Commission of the Central Government alone has translated and published more than 700,000 copies of books and periodicals in Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Hazak. The local ethnic minority language publishing industry and the news industry have also developed considerably. Now, the broad masses of Mongolian, Tibetan, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Korean nationalities are reading Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought works, policy documents of the Central People's Government, as well as science and technology knowledge books and literary works in their own languages. The Uyghur and Kazakh versions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" have also been distributed in Xinjiang.

In addition, broadcasting and film in ethnic minority languages are also developing. The music and dance of ethnic minorities are famous. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic line, many literary and art workers are studying and organizing these arts with excellent traditions.

The customs and religious beliefs of ethnic minorities are fully respected. In July of this year, Islamic figures from ten ethnic groups held a preparatory meeting for the China Islamic Association in Beijing, which powerfully illustrates the full right of ethnic minorities to enjoy freedom of religious belief.

Fifthly, the Central Government's visits to all nationalities and the visits of representatives of all nationalities to the capital and other places.

In order to visit the people of all nationalities, understand the living conditions of all nationalities, and strengthen ties with the people of all nationalities, the Central People's Government has sent four visiting groups to the Southwest, Northwest, Central South, Northeast, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other regions to generally visit all ethnic minorities in the country. The relevant local people's governments have also conducted similar visits to ethnic minorities in their respective regions. At the same time, ethnic minorities have also organized many visiting groups to come to Beijing to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and to visit the capital and the great constructions in various parts of the motherland. Such visits have great significance in strengthening the unity of all nationalities and enhancing the patriotic awareness of the people of all nationalities.

The above is a general overview of the nationality work in the three years since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Having gained national equality and equal rights, all ethnic minorities, like the Han people, have participated in the construction of the motherland with unprecedented enthusiasm. Especially in the great movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, they enthusiastically participated in the Chinese People's Volunteers and the patriotic production increase and donation movement. They have shown extremely high enthusiasm in signing the Stockholm Appeal, supporting the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, and voting against the US armed Japan, and opposing the US aggressors launching germ warfare, and other previous movements to defend world peace. They deeply hate the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism, and they have a universal and deep friendship with the peace-loving people of the world. These facts powerfully illustrate that under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China, and the Central People's Government, the patriotic enthusiasm and political awareness of all nationalities in China have been greatly enhanced, and our great motherland has become unprecedentedly strong due to the solid unity of all nationalities.

    三年来民族工作的成就
    中央人民政府民族事务委员会副主任委员  刘格平
    中华人民共和国成立以来，全国在实施毛主席的民族政策方面，获得了辉煌的成就。各民族人民的爱国主义的政治觉悟提高了，各民族平等团结友爱合作的兄弟关系更加巩固了。团结在伟大祖国大家庭中的各民族的政治、经济、文化各方面都获得了空前的显著的发展，各民族人民的生活也日益得到了改善。
    首先是实现了各民族的平等权利，推行了民族的区域自治政策。今年八月九日，中央人民政府颁布了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，这个纲要是三年来实行民族的区域自治政策的总结。截至一九五二年六月止，已经建立的民族自治区有一百三十个，其中有相当于专区或相当于县的，也有相当于区或相当于乡的。若干人口很少的少数民族如内蒙古的鄂伦春族、西北的保安族，在其聚居区也实行了区域自治。民族区域自治政策的推行，加强了民族团结，激发了各少数民族人民的爱国积极性，推动了当地的各项工作，从而迅速地改变着少数民族社会生活各方面的面貌。
    为了保障各民族杂居区少数民族的平等权利，中央人民政府政务院公布了关于地方民族民主联合政府实施办法的决定。截至一九五二年六月止，已建立的民族民主联合政府有二百多个。这一制度的推行，使少数民族杂居区的各民族，都有适当名额的本民族代表参加当地的政权工作。这就满足了民族杂居区少数民族参加政权的要求，从而加强了民族团结。
    对于散居在汉民族或其他民族居民中的若干少数民族成分，中央人民政府政务院公布了关于保障一切散居的少数民族成分享有平等权利的决定，充分地保障了他们与汉族人民或在当地占多数的其他民族人民同样享有各种自由权利，禁止一切对他们的歧视或侮辱的行为。
    中央人民政府如此切实地保障各民族在政治上的平等权利，这就使得全国各少数民族都能亲密地团结在中华人民共和国大家庭里，为保卫祖国、建设祖国、创造美满幸福的生活，而表现了从未有过的高度热情和巨大力量。
    其次是大量而普遍地培养了少数民族干部。随着民族工作的推进，和少数民族中建设事业的发展，少数民族干部的需要日见迫切。为了普遍而大量地培养少数民族干部，早在一九五○年十一月间，中央人民政府政务院就颁发了培养少数民族干部试行方案和筹办中央民族学院试行方案。三年来，各地除了在工作中放手使用和大胆提拔少数民族干部外，还普遍开办了各种民族干部训练班和民族干部学校。在北京建立了中央民族学院，并在西北、西南、中南设立了八个中央民族学院分院。这些民族干部的民族成分包括全国一切民族，仅中央民族学院及其分院毕业的学生就包括了六十多个民族。
    为了鼓励与帮助少数民族学生受到高等教育和普通教育，少数民族学生投考高等学校和中等学校得到了优先入学的照顾。因此，三年来已有不少的少数民族学生进入了高等学校和中等学校。
    各级人民政府在培养少数民族干部的同时，还调派了必需的汉族干部到少数民族地区工作。这些汉族干部一般地都能同当地的民族干部和群众建立亲密合作的关系，热情地为少数民族人民服务，对少数民族地区各项工作的开展起了很大的作用。
    第三是在少数民族地区开展了贸易工作，恢复和发展了农业和牧业生产。三年来，人民政府在广大的少数民族地区建立了国营贸易机构，根据不同的情况，分别设置了国营贸易公司门市部、采购站、代销店等企业机构和大批流动的贸易小组。这些贸易机构，根据公平合理的价格政策，有时并特别提高土产品的价格，大量收购少数民族地区的土产品，供应日用必需品，因此，土产品与工业品的交换比值起了空前的变化。如在湘西苗族自治区，解放前，每百斤五棓子只能换二十二斤十三两食盐，现在已能换到七十六斤十三两食盐。又如在新疆，解放前要一千七百九十四斤小麦或一百一十九斤羊毛才能换到一匹雁塔布，而到今年上半年，只要二百三十七斤小麦或三十二斤羊毛就能换到了。
    各民族地区国营贸易机构的业务范围也在日益扩大。据中国畜产公司西北区公司不完全的统计，今年上半年仅在青海、宁夏、甘肃、陕西四省，即收购了四百八十六万余斤羊毛，较去年同时期增加了百分之六十点三七。各地国营贸易公司在扩大经营中，还对少数民族地区土产、特产品的生产进行了组织与领导的工作，帮助少数民族人民改进了产品的品质规格，使少数民族地区的许多土产、特产发展起来，并得到广阔的销路。例如：新疆去年出口的加工毛类，平均只有百分之七十五到八十五合乎国际规格，而今年经过加工的第一批出口的蒙古毛、库车毛都超过了国际规格。在西南，少数民族地区外销的土产、特产品原来只有二十三种，现在扩大到一百五十多种。
    为了满足少数民族地区贸易的需要，许多地区的贸易行政机构和国营贸易企业还推动和领导了私商对少数民族地区进行贸易，同时帮助了少数民族人民经营商业——恢复和建立定期的集市。内蒙古自治区在国营经济的领导和扶植下，还普遍发展了合作事业。
    现在，少数民族地区和全国各地的物产已经广泛地流通起来。拉萨的商人带着贝母、虫草、麝香、氆氇等西藏土产品已经到达了云南西北部的丽江县和甘肃的夏河县（即拉卜楞）。在拉卜楞的市场上，随时可以买到上海的铝锅，江西的瓷器，广州的象牙雕刻。而在上海和广州，也可以随时买到新疆的哈密瓜干和葡萄干。
    为了帮助少数民族恢复和发展农业生产，人民政府在少数民族农业地区帮助他们开垦荒地以扩大耕地面积，兴修水利以防止灾害，并改变土质、倡导精耕细作、给以技术指导以提高单位面积产量，并发放贷款以扶助少数民族人民度荒和解决缺乏生产资金的问题。现在，少数民族地区的农业已有了很大的进步。单位面积产量一般都提高了一成到一倍不等，有的高达三、四倍。人民政府在若干少数民族地区还建立了国营农场，通过这些农场，以进步的耕作方法指导着少数民族农民。西康藏族自治区人民在国营农场指导下，今年提出了增产粮食二千吨的计划。
    为了帮助少数民族发展牧畜业，人民政府也做了很多工作。一般是在牧畜区注意指导各民族、各部落间合理地使用草原，并以贷款帮助牧民储草过冬，发动牧民修盖牲畜圈棚，改进饲养方法，并大力防治兽疫。缺草缺水的地区还发动牧民培植牧草和打井。此外并在牧畜区推行牲畜配种和有重点地改进牲畜品种。牧畜业在经济中占有重要地位的西北区和内蒙古自治区，牲畜的数目现在都有大量增加。内蒙古自治区现有牲畜较一九四五年才解放时增加了将近一倍。
    其他各种生产事业，如手工业、林业和各种副业等，也有很大发展。有的地区如内蒙古自治区和新疆并已开始了现代工业的建设。
    在社会改革问题上，人民政府采取慎重稳进的方针，根据少数民族地区大多数人民及与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿，并主要地经过他们自己去进行。在这个方针下，已有不少的少数民族农业区实行了减租退押，有的地区并已实行土地改革。在牧业区，由于牧业的经营带有资本主义性质，则实行牧主牧工两利政策，同时逐步取消牧主的封建特权，鼓励牧主的生产积极性，以发展牧畜经济。
    第四是文化教育、卫生事业的发展。
    过去，因为疾病关系，少数民族人口的死亡率很大，许多少数民族近几十年来人口都在减少中。因此，防治疾病是各少数民族非常迫切的要求。
    中央人民政府针对少数民族这一迫切的需要，积极地开展了民族卫生工作，计先后拨给少数民族地区的卫生事业补助费共达一千零九十二亿余元。到
    一九五二年初，在各少数民族聚居的县份恢复和建立的县卫生院和县卫生所，已有一百八十七个。此外在民族杂居的县份还建立了很多卫生院和卫生所。
    为了加强民族卫生工作，中央人民政府卫生部和各地卫生机关前后派出五十多个卫生队到西北区、西南区、中南区、内蒙古自治区的少数民族地区替少数民族免费治疗。进入少数民族地区的人民解放军医务人员也热情地为少数民族人民治病。西藏和平解放后，中央人民政府卫生部随即派遣入藏医疗工作组，并拨款数十亿元作为替西藏人民医疗的费用。这些流动的卫生队和医疗组克服了种种困难，深入草原、远达边疆，在广大的少数民族地区扶生救死，受到各少数民族人民的热烈欢迎。他们在各地区除治疗疾病外，还进行了卫生宣传和大力推广妇幼卫生的工作。
    人民政府根据少数民族地区的疫病情况，特别着重地方病的预防和治疗。在这个方针下，内蒙古自治区普遍设立了鼠疫的预防和治疗机构。内蒙古自治区和西康藏族自治区建立了性病防治所。云南省和贵州省建立了疟疾防治站。这种重点的防治工作，收到了很大的成效。例如内蒙古自治区，过去流行甚广的鼠疫现已将近完全消灭，梅毒患者经治疗而痊愈的约占百分之七十以上。据陈巴尔虎旗一九五一年一月到五月的调查，该旗婴儿出生率比一九五○年同期提高百分之七十九。
    人民政府也帮助少数民族发展了教育事业。有的地区教育已经相当普及，如东北朝鲜族入学儿童已达学龄儿童百分之九十二左右。有的地区的学校数目发展很快，如内蒙古自治区的小学比日本帝国主义统治时期的最高数字增加了三倍多。有些过去根本没有学校的民族如鄂伦春族，现在已有了自己的学校。有些地区如新疆和延边朝鲜族自治区，不仅有小学和中学，而且还有了高等学校。若干地区，如内蒙古自治区和新疆等地区还开展了群众性的冬学运动。
    中央人民政府重视发展少数民族的语言文字，因此政务院文化教育委员会特别成立了“民族语言文字研究指导委员会”，负责指导和组织关于少数民族语言文字的研究工作，没有文字的帮助创立文字，文字不完备的帮助求其完备。西康彝族新彝文的创立，是这方面工作的开端。人民政府并充分运用了现有的条件，大力发展少数民族文字的出版事业。仅中央民族事务委员会用蒙文、藏文、维吾尔文翻译出版的书刊就有七十多万册。地方的民族文字出版事业和新闻事业也有相当的发展。现在蒙族、藏族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族、朝鲜族的广大人民都在用本民族的文字阅读马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的著作，阅读中央人民政府的政策文件以及科学技术知识读物和文艺作品。“毛泽东选集”的维吾尔文版和哈萨克文版单行本也已经在新疆发行。
    此外，少数民族语言的广播和电影也在发展中。少数民族的音乐、舞蹈是有名的。在毛主席的文艺方针指导下，许多文艺工作者正在研究和整理这些有优秀传统的艺术。
    少数民族的风俗习惯和宗教信仰是受到充分尊重的。今年七月间，包括了十个民族成分的伊斯兰教人士在北京举行了中国伊斯兰教协会筹备会议，有力地说明了少数民族享有宗教信仰自由的充分权利。
    第五是中央对各民族的访问和各民族代表到首都及各地参观。
    中央人民政府为了访问各民族人民，了解各民族的生活状况，加强与各民族人民的联系，先后派出了四个访问团到西南、西北、中南、东北、内蒙古自治区等地区普遍访问了国内各少数民族。各有关的地方人民政府对本地区的少数民族也进行了同样的访问工作。与此同时，各少数民族也组织了许多的参观团到北京来向毛主席和中央人民政府致敬，并参观了首都和祖国各地的各项伟大的建设。这样的访问和参观，对于加强各民族的团结，提高各民族人民爱国主义的觉悟有着极大的意义。
    以上就是中华人民共和国建国三年来民族工作的概况。
    获得了民族平等地位与平等权利的各少数民族和汉族人民一样，空前积极地参加了祖国的各项建设事业。特别是在伟大的抗美援朝运动中，他们曾踊跃地参加了中国人民志愿军和爱国增产捐献运动。他们在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名、拥护五大国缔结和平公约签名，投票反对美国武装日本、反对美国侵略者发动细菌战等历次的保卫世界和平的运动中，都有极高的热情。他们对以美国帝国主义为首的侵略势力深恶痛绝，而对于全世界爱好和平的人民则有着普遍的深厚的友谊。这些事实有力地说明了在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导下，中国各民族的爱国积极性和政治觉悟已经大大提高了，我们的伟大祖国已由于各民族的巩固团结而空前强大起来了。
