Xinhua News Agency, Washington, September 24th: The current election campaigns of the two major parties of the American ruling class have further exposed the dark secrets of American politics. Recently, while the Republican Party was launching a massive attack on the Democratic Party for the corruption of the Truman administration, the scandal of Republican Vice Presidential candidate Nixon accepting subsidies from wealthy businessmen was revealed. The Democratic Party seized on this incident to launch a fierce counterattack, catching the Republican Party off guard and in a state of utter disarray. The exposure of corruption scandals in both party groups once again revealed that the Donkey (symbol of the Democratic Party) and the Elephant (symbol of the Republican Party) are, in fact, birds of a feather.

The matter of Nixon accepting subsidies was recently exposed by the pro-Democratic "New York Post." The fact is: During Nixon's two years as a Senator in California, he accepted more than $18,000 in subsidies from more than 70 wealthy businessmen in the state. The reason why the big businessmen of California subsidized Nixon was because they wanted Nixon to follow their instructions when "voting" on bills in the Senate. Nixon not only accepted bribery subsidies, but also violated tax laws by failing to report this income.

As soon as the matter came to light, it spread throughout the country. The Democratic Party, through its National Committee Chairman Mitchell, launched an attack, demanding that Nixon relinquish his qualification as the Republican Vice Presidential candidate. Mitchell said that "Nixon's acceptance of grants from wealthy California businessmen to subsidize his Senator's salary" was "an immoral thing," and that "neither public nor private moral standards can tolerate or defend such behavior." Mitchell challenged Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower, saying: "The moment of decision has arrived for General Eisenhower: he must either abandon his pretense of demanding moral values from his supporters, or abandon his running mate."

Because there was really no way to deny it, Nixon himself had to admit on the 18th that he had indeed accepted a $16,000 grant from certain "private individuals" to make up for his so-called "administrative expenses," in an attempt to whitewash himself. Nixon counterattacked the Democratic Party by exposing their acts of using public office for private gain, saying: "If I didn't do this and took another approach, I might have taken advantage of various tax exemptions, free government transportation, or I could have had my wife receive a federal salary like the Democratic Vice Presidential candidate (Sparkman)." At the same time, Eisenhower also tried his best to cover up, insisting that the matter was a "misunderstanding." One of Eisenhower's advisors deliberately stated that there were "political assassination germs" present.

However, in any case, the Nixon incident has caused a major wound to the Republican Party in the election contest. According to the Associated Press, "Eisenhower's friends believe that Nixon, who has been talking about the (Truman) government's 'scandals,' may lose his political mobility due to this exposure." This incident has become a difficult problem for the Republican campaign headquarters. According to Agence France-Presse on the 21st, Eisenhower has received at least 400 telegrams from all sides, expressing their opinions on the "Nixon incident," half of which clearly demanded that Eisenhower take measures to make Nixon give up his qualification as a Vice Presidential candidate. Because the matter has become too scandalous and has given voters a very bad impression, Eisenhower is now having to consider whether to let Nixon, who he once praised as "an honest man," continue to be his running mate.

    美国总统竞选丑闻
    【新华社二十四日讯】华盛顿消息：美国统治集团两大政党目前的竞选活动，进一步暴露了美国政界的黑幕。最近当共和党利用杜鲁门政府的贪污腐化对民主党大肆攻击的时候，又传出了共和党副总统候选人尼克松接受富商津贴的丑闻。民主党利用这个事件痛加反击，使共和党措手不及，狼狈不堪。两党集团贪污丑闻之被揭穿，再一次暴露出毛驴
    （民主党象征）与大象（共和党象征），原来都是一丘之貉。
    尼克松接受津贴一事是最近被支持民主党的“纽约邮报”揭穿的。事实是：尼克松在任加利福尼亚州参议员的两年期间，曾接受了该州七十多名富商资助的一万八千多美元的津贴。加利福尼亚州的大商人们所以资助尼克松，是因为他们要尼克松在参议院通过法案“投票”时听从他们的指挥。尼克松不仅收受贿赂性的津贴，而且违反税法，不报缴这笔收入的所得税。
    事情闹出来以后，立刻就风传全国。民主党通过其全国委员会主席密歇尔发动攻击，要求尼克松就此放弃其共和党副总统候选人的资格。密歇尔说，
    “尼克松接受加利福尼亚州富商的赠款以补贴他的参议员薪金一事”是“不道德的事情”，“无论是按照公德或私德的标准都不能够容忍这种行为，或为这种行为辩护”。密歇尔向共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔挑战说：“艾森豪威尔将军抉择的时刻已经到来了：他或者放弃装模作样地要求他的拥护者要有道德观念的姿态，或者抛弃他的竞选伙伴。”
    由于实在无法抵赖，尼克松本人在十八日也不得不承认他确曾从某些“私人”接受了一万六千美元的赠款来弥补他的所谓“行政开支”，企图这样来替他自己洗刷。尼克松反咬民主党一口揭露民主党假公济私的行径说：“假如我不这样做而换一种办法的话，我可能要利用免付税款的种种便利、政府的免费交通工具，或者我可以像民主党副总统候选人（斯巴克曼）一样叫我的老婆领取联邦的薪金。”同时，艾森豪威尔也竭力掩饰，硬说这件事是“误解”。艾森豪威尔的一个顾问故意表示，这里面存在着“政治暗杀的细菌”。
    但是，不论怎样，尼克松事件已使共和党在竞选角逐中受到重大创伤。据美联社消息，“艾森豪威尔的朋友们相信，一直在谈论着（杜鲁门）政府“丑闻百出”的尼克松，可能由于这种暴露而丧失政治上的活动能力。”这一事件已成为共和党竞选总部的难题，据法新社二十一日消息透露，艾森豪威尔至少已收到来自各方的四百封电报，对“尼克松事件”表示意见，其中有一半明白要求艾森豪威尔采取措施使尼克松放弃副总统候选人资格。由于事情已经闹得太丑，给选民的印象十分恶劣，艾森豪威尔目前也不得不考虑是否还让这位当初曾被他夸奖为“一个诚实的人”的尼克松继续充当他的竞选伙伴。
