    Hubei Province, Wuchang County People's Government
    Has Punished Village Cadres Involved in Li Hu's Murder of Daughter-in-Law Case
    Comrade Editor: After your newspaper's "Reader's Letters" column on November 30, 1951, published the opinion "Hubei Wuchang County's Revised Marriage Case (Li Hu's Murder of Daughter-in-Law Case), Village Cadres Who Gave False Testimony Should Also Be Punished," we immediately notified the Wuchang County People's Government to handle it. Now, according to the Wuchang County People's Government's reply, the village cadres Chen Weicai and Hu Baipin, who were involved in the case and gave false testimony, had their positions revoked long ago and were ordered to make self-criticisms to the villagers.
