    An introduction to the Chinese edition, No. 158, of the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
    The editorial in this issue is entitled "Welcoming the World People's Peace Congress." Other important articles in this issue include Apostol, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, "On the Draft Constitution of the Romanian People's Republic," Vlandas, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Greek Communist Party, "The Collusion between Belgrade and the Athens Fascists is a Threat to Peace in the Balkans," and Groot, General Secretary of the Dutch Communist Party, "Oppose the Bonn Separate Treaty, Strive for Dutch National Independence," etc.
    The editorial in this issue says: The World Peace Council's resolution to convene the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna on December 5 this year is a historically significant resolution that mobilizes all people who oppose war, regardless of political views, race, religion, or social status, to unite and strengthen their forces. Peace fighters must convince the men and women of every country to realize that everyone must come together to discuss the issue of defending peace and find solutions to these problems.
    Apostol's article states: The new draft constitution of the Romanian People's Republic reflects the changes that have taken place in Romania's economy and socio-political aspects since April 1948. Apostol pointed out: Now that the new draft constitution has been promulgated, in 1952, the working people led by the working class, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, thanks to the generous and comprehensive assistance of the Soviet Union, have begun to develop the national economy in a planned way, and have been striving with all their strength to achieve the first Five-Year Plan and the ten-year electrification plan of the Romanian People's Republic. He analyzed in detail the tremendous changes that have taken place in Romania's industrial, agricultural, and other economic life, socio-political life, and cultural life over the years, and elaborated in detail the various provisions of the new draft constitution. He said: The new draft constitution embodies the victory of the Romanian people's long struggle for freedom and national independence, and at the same time embodies the lofty ideal of brotherly friendship among all ethnic groups and the idea of proletarian internationalism. Apostol pointed out: The new draft constitution not only establishes various important rights and freedoms, but also guarantees the realization of these rights. The new constitution also states that in the Romanian People's Republic, the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" is being implemented on an increasingly wider scale. The Romanian working class and working people, who are fighting with confidence for a better future, welcome the new draft constitution with utmost satisfaction and joy. Apostol finally expressed the Romanian people's warm love and heartfelt gratitude to Comrade Stalin, the drafter of the constitution of the free people - the Soviet Constitution.
    In his article, Vlandas exposed the conspiracy of the delegation composed of seventeen members of the Greek royalist fascist parliament who recently visited Yugoslavia. Vlandas pointed out that the US-British imperialists are piecing together a military "triangle" - Athens - Belgrade - Ankara. But the people of Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey hate war and its organizers. The people of these countries yearn for peace, and with the help of the powerful world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, they will spare no effort to safeguard peace in the Balkan Peninsula, defeat fascism, and expel the US-British occupiers.
    In his article, Groot pointed out: The purpose of the Bonn separate treaty is to prevent Germany's unification. Together with the "European Defense Community" agreement, it has created a new center of war in the heart of Europe, which further damages the national independence of the Dutch people. At the same time, the Bonn separate treaty will seriously worsen the economic conditions of the Dutch working people. Therefore, the current serious task of the Dutch Communist Party is to help the broad masses launch a struggle against the Bonn separate treaty and against the Dutch Parliament's ratification of the "European Defense Community" agreement.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五八期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一五八期已经出版。
    本期社论题为“迎接世界人民和平大会”。本期其他重要文章有罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记阿波斯托尔的“论罗马尼亚人民共和国宪法草案”，希腊共产党中央委员会政治局委员伏兰达斯的“贝尔格莱德与雅典法西斯分子的勾结是对巴尔干和平的威胁”，荷兰共产党总书记格鲁特的“反对波恩单独条约，争取荷兰民族独立”等。
    本期社论说：世界和平理事会决议在今年十二月五日在维也纳召开世界人民和平大会，这一个具有历史意义的决议动员所有反对战争的人们，不分政见、种族、宗教信仰和社会地位，一致团结起来并加强自己的力量。和平战士必须说服每个国家的男女，使他们认识到，大家要聚首一堂，来讨论保卫和平的问题并找寻解决这些问题的办法。
    阿波斯托尔的文章说：罗马尼亚人民共和国的新宪法草案反映了一九四八年四月以来罗马尼亚在经济和社会政治方面发生的变化。阿波斯托尔指出：在新宪法草案公布的现在、在一九五二年，以工人阶级为首的劳动人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导之下，由于苏联慷慨而全面的援助，已经着手有计划地发展国民经济，并已经用全力争取实现第一个五年计划，争取实现罗马尼亚人民共和国十年电气化计划。他详细分析了这些年中罗马尼亚在工业、农业等经济生活、社会政治生活及文化生活各方面所发生的巨大变化，并且详细论述了新宪法草案的各种规定。他说：新宪法草案具体表现了罗马尼亚人民很久以来争取自由和民族独立的斗争的胜利，同时还体现了各族人民兄弟般地友好的崇高思想，体现了无产阶级国际主义的思想。阿波斯托尔指出：新宪法草案不仅确定了各种重大的权利和自由，而且保证了这些权利的实现。新宪法并写明，在罗马尼亚人民共和国里，“各尽所能，按劳取酬”这条社会主义的原则正在越来越广泛的规模上付诸实现。为美好将来而满怀信心地斗争的罗马尼亚工人阶级和劳动人民都怀着至为满意和愉快的心情，欢迎新的宪法草案。阿波斯托尔最后并表示了罗马尼亚人民对于自由人民的宪法范本——苏联宪法的起草人斯大林同志的热烈爱戴和衷心感激。
    伏兰达斯在他的文章中揭露了希腊保皇法西斯议会十七个议员组成的代表团最近访问南斯拉夫的阴谋。伏兰达斯指出，美英帝国主义者正在拼凑一个军事“三角”——雅典——贝尔格莱德——安卡拉。但希腊、南斯拉夫和土耳其的人民痛恨战争及其组织者。这些国家的人民渴望和平，他们在以苏联为首的强大世界和平阵营的援助下，将不遗余力地维护巴尔干半岛的和平，击败法西斯主义，驱逐美英占领者。
    格鲁特在文章中指出：波恩单独条约的目的在于阻止德国的统一，它和“欧洲防御集团”协定在欧洲的腹地造成了一个新的战争中心，对荷兰人民来说，就是进一步损害了他们的民族独立。同时波恩单独条约将使荷兰劳动人民的经济条件严重恶化。因此荷兰共产党当前的严重任务，就是帮助广大群众展开反对波恩单独条约、反对荷兰国会批准关于“欧洲防御集团”协定的斗争。　　　（新华社）
