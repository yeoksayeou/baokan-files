    Congratulations to the Achievements of Impartial International Scientists
    Editor: The "International Scientific Commission for Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," after two months of effort, has fully confirmed the crimes of American imperialism in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, enabling the people of the world to further recognize the heinous and brutal nature of American imperialism. All students of Beijing Normal University extend warm congratulations to the achievements of the international scientists in this work.
    The people of the world now have a clearer understanding of the question "Who wants peace? Who wants war?"; at the same time, it has increased people's determination to defend peace a hundredfold. As student union chairman, Comrade Weng Shisheng, said: "The results of this investigation, in an extremely scientific manner, once again proved the crimes of American imperialism. The people of the world will have a deeper understanding of the ferocious nature of American imperialism. The scientists of the International Scientific Commission have worked tirelessly to complete this work, which is of great significance to the happiness and peace of all mankind, demonstrating their high sense of justice and humanitarianism, as well as a serious scientific work attitude."
    This investigative report by international scientists is ironclad evidence that exposes the war-mongers in their true colors. Every Chinese youth is determined to actively publicize this scientific investigation result and study hard to guarantee lasting world peace with our own hard work.

    祝贺公正的国际科学家的成就
    编辑同志：“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”经过了两个月的努力，完全证实了美帝国主义在朝鲜及我国东北进行细菌战的罪行，使世界人民进一步地认识了美帝国主义凶恶残暴的本质。我们北京师范大学全体学生对国际科学家们这一工作的成就，致以热烈的祝贺。
    全世界的人民对“谁要和平？谁要战争？”这个问题，现在是认识得更清楚了；同时也百倍地增强了人们保卫和平的决心。正如学生会主席翁世盛同学所说的：“这一次调查的结果，极其科学地又一次证明了美帝国主义的罪行，全世界人民将会更深刻地认识美帝国主义凶残的本质。国际科学委员会的科学家们这样不辞辛苦地完成了这件对全人类的幸福、和平有很大意义的工作，表现了他们高度的正义感和人道主义精神，以及科学严肃的工作态度。”
    这次国际科学家的调查报告，是铁一般的证据，使战争贩子们原形毕露。我们每一个中国青年决心积极宣传这一个科学的调查结果，并努力学习，以自己辛勤的劳动保证世界的持久和平。
