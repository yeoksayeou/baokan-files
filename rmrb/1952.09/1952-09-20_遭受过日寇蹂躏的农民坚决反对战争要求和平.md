    To the Editor: On the eve of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference being held in Beijing by peace fighters to save peace, we, in our remote mountain village, are also enthusiastically discussing this matter.

    We are farmers who have suffered the "Three Alls Policy" of the Japanese invaders. Many of us lost our parents, husbands, wives, and children in the war. We deeply know the cruelty of war.

    Since liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, we have been working diligently. Over the past few years, with the increase in production, our lives have also greatly improved. The great achievements of the motherland's various constructions make us rejoice; the construction of communism in the Soviet Union, especially the announcement of the second Five-Year Plan after the war, fills us with hope and confidence for the future. However, the United States is still continuing to prolong and expand the war of aggression against Korea, the U.S. Air Force is constantly harassing our Northeast, and is carrying out inhumane germ warfare against the Chinese and Korean people. In particular, the United States is accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism. All this makes our just-settled lives threatened by war again, and we cannot let the houses we have just repaired be destroyed again.

    We Chinese farmers, like the people of other countries in the world, oppose war and demand peace. We know that only a small handful of man-eating beasts desire war and are instigating war. To have peace, we must oppose this small handful of warmongers. Therefore, we hope that the representatives at the conference will discuss some good methods at this conference to expose the criminal faces of the warmongers to the people of the world, so that all peace-loving people around the world can unite to oppose war and strive for peace.

    遭受过日寇蹂躏的农民坚决反对战争要求和平
    编辑同志：正当和平的战士们为着拯救和平，在北京召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的前夕，处在偏僻山村的我们，也正为这件事在热烈地讨论着。
    我们是受过日寇“三光政策”蹂躏的农民，我们许多人都是在战争中失去了父母、丈夫、妻子和儿女，我们深知战争的残酷。
    自从解放以后，在人民政府领导下，我们勤奋地从事劳动，几年来随着生产的提高，我们的生活也有了很大的改善。祖国各项建设的伟大成就，使我们欢欣鼓舞；苏联的共产主义的建设、特别是战后第二个五年计划的公布，更使我们对前途充满着胜利的希望和信心。但是美国还在继续延长与扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，美国空军还在不断地袭扰我国的东北，并且向中朝人民进行惨无人道的细菌战，尤其是美国正在加紧复活日本的军国主义，这一切使我们让刚才平定了的生活又受到战争的威胁，我们不能让刚刚修盖起来的房屋又遭受破坏。
    我们中国的农民和世界其他国家的人民一样，都反对战争，要求和平。我们知道人类中只有一小撮吃人的野兽才愿意战争，并且在策动着战争。要和平必须反对这一小撮战争贩子。因此，我们希望开会的代表们，在这次大会上讨论出几项好办法，向全世界人民揭露战争贩子的罪恶面目，让全世界爱好和平的人民一致团结起来反对战争，争取和平。
