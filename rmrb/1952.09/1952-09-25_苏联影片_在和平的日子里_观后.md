    Thoughts on the Soviet Film "In Peaceful Days"
    Zhou Libo

    "In Peaceful Days" is a beautiful film. It uses color images to depict the life of the Soviet Navy very vividly. The film begins with waves, songs, sunshine, and love, and the world seems very harmonious and peaceful. The ending of the film is also the peaceful life of the Soviet military and civilians. The sea water laps against the pebbled beach, and people's conversations are full of joy. The world seems so beautiful and peaceful.

    However, there are waves in the sea, and peaceful life can be disrupted by war. Peace must be defended and saved, requiring people to exert strength to fight for it. For the sake of a happy peace, people must fight bravely and be constantly vigilant against the aggression of imperialist warmongers.

    "In Peaceful Days" tells people this truth, which is undoubtedly a paramount theme today.

    The plot of the film is clear, tortuous, and intricate. The Soviet submarine No. 8 hits an enemy mine during an exercise and sinks to the bottom of the sea. The sailors use all their strength to repair the blasted hull and damaged machinery. The film shows the sailors' high level of skill and excellent qualities. Before the repairs are completed, the air in the first engine room becomes increasingly scarce. People must leave the ship, must be fired out through the torpedo tubes, but such equipment is only enough for four people, and the other two must stay with the captain. Staying means certain death, and going out is also dangerous, but not necessarily fatal. So everyone is vying to stay. This is a touching scene, and the words of the young torpedo operator Banichuk are even more moving. He said, "Comrade Deputy Captain, I'll stay on the ship. I'm single, but the lieutenant, he has a wife and children."

    There are no empty slogans here, only a heart full of consideration for others. This is what makes it so moving. When a person can sacrifice himself for the happiness of his comrades, he will certainly be able to sacrifice for the motherland, because the motherland is not an abstract thing, but a series of beautiful and concrete things.

    The other end of the story writes about the fleet's search, and during the search, an enemy ship is discovered. The cunning enemy sneaks into the seabed and disguises itself as the No. 8 ship, which adds to the tortuousness and intricacy of the story.

    In these search scenes, the film not only shows the wisdom and calmness of the Soviet naval commanders, but also displays the skills and courage of the divers.

    The film uses very few shots to concisely portray the ugly enemy, exposing their piratical nature. They employ German and Japanese fascist remnants to attack the Soviet coast with submarines in peaceful days. However, just as the enemy's attacking submarine was crushed, their conspiracy to provoke war was also shattered.

    The entire film makes people feel tense and joyful from beginning to end. The characters are full of vitality. The courage and honesty, enthusiasm and joy of Soviet youth are particularly vividly portrayed.

    In peaceful days, peace fighters all over the world cannot relax their vigilance against war instigators in the slightest. This is the central meaning that this beautiful film "In Peaceful Days" tells us.

    苏联影片“在和平的日子里”观后
    周立波
    “在和平的日子里”是一部美丽的影片。它用彩色的画面把苏联的海军的生活表现得非常的生动。影片一开始，就是海浪，歌声，阳光和爱情，世界显得十分和谐与平静。影片的结尾也是苏联军民的和平生活，海水拍打着细石的浅滩，人们的闲谈里充满着欢快，世界显得如此美丽、平静。
    但是，海里是有波涛的，和平的生活会被战争破坏。和平要保卫，要拯救，要求人们拿出力量来争取，为了幸福的和平，人们必须勇敢地斗争，必须时时刻刻警惕帝国主义战争贩子的侵犯。
    “在和平的日子里”把这个真理告诉了人们，这在今天来说无疑是头等重要的主题。
    影片的情节是明晰、曲折而且错综的。苏联八号潜水舰在演习的时候触到了敌人的水雷，沉到了海底，水兵们用尽一切力量修补炸破了的舱壁和震坏了的机器，影片表现了水兵的高度的技术和优秀的品质。修理还没有完成，第一机械室的空气却越来越少，人们必须离开舰，必须由鱼雷管射出去，但这样的装备，只够四个人用，另外两个人必须跟着舰长留下。留着一定死亡，出去也危险，但不一定死，于是所有的人都争着留下，这是一个感人的场面，青年鱼雷手巴尼楚克的话更为动人，他说：“副舰长同志，我留在船上。我是单身汉，可是，少尉同志呢，他有老婆，孩子。”
    这里没有空洞的口号，这里充满着体贴别人的人情。这就是它的动人的地方。当一个人能够为了战友的幸福而牺牲自己的时候，他也一定能为祖国而牺牲，因为祖国并不是抽象的东西，祖国是一连串的优美的具体的事物构成的。
    故事的另外一头写的是舰队的搜寻，在搜寻之际发现了敌舰，狡猾的敌人潜入了海底，伪装八号舰，这就增加了故事的曲折性和错综性。
    在这些寻找的场面里，影片不但表现了苏联海军将领的明智和镇定，也显示了潜水夫们的技巧和勇敢。
    影片用很少的镜头概括地表现了丑恶的敌人，暴露了他们的海盗的本性。他们起用德国和日本的法西斯残匪，在和平的日子里，用潜水舰来偷袭苏联的海岸。但是，正和敌人偷袭的潜水舰被粉碎了一样，他们企图挑起战争的阴谋也被粉碎了。
    整个的影片从头到尾都使人感到紧张，又觉得欢快。人物都充满了活力。苏联青年的勇敢和诚实，热情和愉快，特别鲜明地被刻划出来了。
    在和平的日子里，全世界的和平战士丝毫也不能放松对战争挑拨者的警惕，这是“在和平的日子里”这个美丽的影片告诉我们的中心的意思。
