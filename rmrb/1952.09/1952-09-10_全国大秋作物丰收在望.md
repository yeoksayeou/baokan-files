Nationwide Bumper Harvest of Autumn Crops in Sight

[This newspaper's report] Following the bumper harvest of summer crops, a bumper harvest of autumn grain crops is also expected nationwide this year. Judging from the current crop growth, if there are no other unexpected disasters, it is estimated that the national rice production will increase by more than 10% compared to last year, and coarse grains will increase by more than 15% compared to last year. Autumn grain crops in the North China region are growing well, and the total output is expected to increase by 25% to 30% compared to last year. Shanxi Province suffered relatively severe wind, insect, and hail disasters this year, but thanks to the timely and effective prevention and control measures taken by the People's Government, it is estimated that grain crops can still achieve 85% of a normal harvest. The East China region was hit by typhoons in July, but the total output of autumn grain in the region may still exceed the plan, increasing by more than 10% compared to last year. The Southwest region experienced a severe spring drought, which somewhat affected spring plowing and sowing. After June, some areas, such as Yunnan, Xikang, and Guizhou, again experienced drought conditions, which were not completely relieved until early August. Thanks to the leadership of the People's Governments at all levels in the Southwest region, the broad masses of farmers launched a drought prevention and resistance campaign, and the sowing and transplanting of ordinary farmland were advanced by 10 to 15 days compared to previous years. Coarse grains were generally cultivated and weeded two or three times, and rice in some areas was hoed three times, so crops are growing well, and the plan to increase grain production by 5% compared to last year can still be achieved. The Central South region had sufficient spring rain this year, and sowing was smooth. However, before and after the wheat harvest, most areas experienced drought and waterlogging. People's Governments at all levels led farmers in flood control, drought prevention, and drainage to save the fields. Except for Hubei, where drought conditions were relatively severe and may result in reduced production, provinces such as Jiangxi and Hunan can achieve bumper harvests. It is estimated that the rice yield in the region will exceed this year's planned output by 2.97%. The Northeast region had sufficient rainfall this year. In May and June, provinces such as western Liaoning and eastern Liaoning suffered from wind and hail, but the losses were not significant. In early August, sorghum and soybeans in some areas were infested with aphids. After vigorous eradication efforts, coupled with rainfall and a drop in temperature in mid-August, the pest infestation has basically stopped developing. This year, autumn fields in the entire region were generally plowed and harrowed more than three times, and rice was also hoed three times, and topdressing was generally applied two or three times. Therefore, crop growth is generally vigorous, and it is expected that the output of autumn grain crops in the entire Northeast region will exceed the plan. Summer field sowing in the Northwest region began in early March, 10 days earlier than in previous years. Since entering the summer, there have been no major disasters, and a bumper harvest of autumn crops is expected. The sowing period for farmland in Inner Mongolia was 10 to 20 days earlier than last year. Spring and summer rainfall was sufficient, and crop growth was good. It is estimated that the output of autumn crops in the entire region will be more than double that of last year.

    At present, some provinces and regions in Central South, Southwest, and East China have begun to harvest early autumn crops. Many areas are focusing on the autumn bumper harvest appraisal campaign, rectifying mutual aid and cooperation organizations, summarizing bumper harvest experiences, and selecting superior varieties to prepare for striving for greater harvests next year.

    全国大秋作物丰收在望
    【本报讯】继夏收作物丰收之后，今年全国大秋粮食作物又将获得丰收。根据目前作物生长情况看来，如无其他意外的灾害，估计全国水稻可比去年增产一成以上，杂粮可比去年增产一成半以上。华北区秋季粮食作物生长良好，总产量可比去年增产二成半到三成。山西省今年遭受了较重的风、虫、雹等灾害，但由于人民政府及时地采取了有效的防治措施，估计粮食作物仍能获得八成半的年景。华东区七月间受到台风侵袭，但全区秋季粮食总产量仍可能超过计划，比去年增产一成以上。西南区春旱较重，春耕播种曾受到一些影响。六月以后，部分地区如云南、西康、贵州等地又呈旱象，至八月上旬旱象始全部解除。由于西南区各级人民政府领导广大农民群众展开了防旱抗旱斗争，一般农田的播种插秧比往年提早了十天到十五天。杂粮一般中耕除草两三次，有些地区的水稻都薅了三遍，因而作物生长良好，比去年增产粮食百分之五的计划仍可完成。中南区今年春雨充足，播种顺利。但麦收前后，大部地区发生了旱、涝的现象，各级人民政府领导农民进行了防汛、防旱、排渍救田的斗争，全区除湖北因旱情比较严重可能减产外，江西、湖南等省都可得到丰收。估计全区水稻产量可超过今年计划产量的百分之二点九七。东北区今年雨水充足。五、六月间，辽西、辽东等省曾有风、雹为灾，但损失不大。八月初部分地区的高粱、大豆发生蚜虫，经大力扑杀，加上八月中旬各地降雨，气温下降，虫害已基本停止发展。今年全区秋田一般都铲、趟三遍以上，水稻也薅过三次，并普遍用了两三次追肥。因此，作物生长普遍旺盛，预计东北全区秋季粮食作物产量可超过计划。西北区夏田播种在三月初即已开始，比往年提早了十天。入夏以后无大灾害，秋季作物丰收有望。内蒙古农田的播种期已比去年提早十天到二十天，春夏雨水不缺，作物生长良好，估计全区秋季作物产量将超过去年一倍。
    目前中南、西南、华东部分省区已开始收割早秋作物。许多地区正在以秋季丰产评比运动为中心，整顿互助合作组织，总结丰产经验，评选优良品种，为明年争取更大丰收作准备。
