Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A movement to protest against the screening of a film glorifying the fascist general Rommel has unfolded among the working people of Vienna. People have been constantly distributing leaflets near the cinema, despite persecution, demanding the immediate cessation of the screening and a ban on the film.

On September 19, the masses in Vienna held a demonstration. On the orders of Interior Minister Helmer, the Vienna police dispersed the demonstrating masses with rubber batons. Many clashes occurred between the police and the demonstrators. Several demonstrators who were injured by the police have been taken to hospital. More than thirty people have been arrested. When the members of the left-wing group of the Vienna City Council learned of the police's brutality against the demonstrators, they immediately wrote to Mayor Jonas, demanding an immediate halt to the screening of the aforementioned fascist film in Vienna.

The Austrian Former Concentration Camp Inmates' Alliance wrote a letter to all democratic groups, urging them to take joint action to demand a ban on the film. The letter emphasized that this film about Rommel tries to whitewash this fascist general, who was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of concentration camp inmates and resistance movement participants. This appeal has been met with enthusiastic response. Dozens of letters, resolutions, and telegrams have been sent from various places to the Austrian authorities, protesting against the screening of this film.

This mass protest movement of the people of Vienna has been victorious. According to evening newspapers, the film about Rommel has been banned from being shown.

    抗议放映歌颂法西斯将领隆美尔的影片
    维也纳劳动人民斗争获胜
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：维也纳劳动人民中间展开了一个抗议放映歌颂法西斯将领隆美尔的影片的运动。电影院附近始终有人不顾迫害地在那里散发传单，要求立即停止放映并禁映这部影片。
    九月十九日，维也纳的群众举行了示威游行。在内政部长赫尔麦的命令下，维也纳的警察用橡皮棍子驱散示威的群众。警察和示威群众之间发生了许多次冲突。有几个被警察打伤的示威者已被送入医院。有三十多个人被捕。当维也纳市议会左翼集团的议员们得知警察对示威群众犯有暴行后，立即写信给市长容那斯，要求立即制止在维也纳放映上述法西斯影片。
    奥地利前集中营犯联盟写了一封信给所有的民主团体，敦促他们采取联合行动，要求禁止放映这部影片。信中强调指出：这部关于隆美尔的影片竭力为这个法西斯将领洗刷，他对于成千成万集中营犯人及抵抗运动参加者的死亡是负有责任的。这个呼吁已经得到热烈的响应。各地已向奥地利当局发出数十件信件、决议和电报，抗议放映这部影片。
    这次维也纳人民的群众性抗议运动是胜利的。据晚报称，那张关于隆美尔的影片已被禁止上映了。
