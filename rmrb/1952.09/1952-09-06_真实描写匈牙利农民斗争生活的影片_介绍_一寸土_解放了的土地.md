    Directed by: Pál Fejős. Produced by the Hungarian Film Studio. Dubbed by Shanghai Film Studio. "A Foot of Land" won the Labor Award at the 4th International Film Festival.
    The Hungarian films "A Foot of Land" and "Liberated Land," which are being shown to Chinese audiences for the first time, are among the excellent films of Hungarian People's Cinema. These films are adapted from the novel "Wedding, Baptism, Cradle" by the famous Hungarian writer Pál Szabó, and are divided into two parts. They vividly depict the lives and struggles of Hungarian peasants before and after liberation.

    In the first part, "A Foot of Land," we see the miserable lives of Hungarian peasants before liberation, who, under extra-economic exploitation, worked all day long but could not get enough to eat or wear. The film truthfully reflects the rural situation in Hungary before liberation through the depiction of the experiences of the peasants Gós and Marika.

    As soon as the film begins, it attracts the audience's concern for the fate of Gós and Marika. The poor peasant Marika is used as an item to repay her parents' debt to a wealthy farmer and is forced to marry the wealthy farmer's son, Fok. Marika's lover, Gós, is also a poor peasant. Although he rescues Marika and marries her, a series of disasters follow.

    Through the depiction of some ordinary life scenes, the film portrays the contradictions between landlords and peasants very sharply. On one side, we see the peasant Gós selling his labor cheaply, performing back-breaking labor, digging fish ponds for the landlord, and digging wells and growing vegetables on his own land. Marika, seven months pregnant, still participates in the heavy labor of pushing water carts and watering vegetable gardens, all to pay off her parents' debts and a large sum of divorce compensation. On the other side, we see the landlord's manager deducting wages and insulting Marika, and the wealthy farmer destroying Gós's vegetable garden, wanting Gós and Marika to "be poor for the rest of their lives and never be able to turn themselves around"; they cheaply buy Marika's parents' house, leaving them with nowhere to live. In short, the landlords and wealthy farmers take pleasure in creating disasters and misfortunes for the people.

    Gós and Marika's disasters are not over. The misfortunes produced by the old system are shadow-like and linked to their fate. Following the man-made disasters comes a natural disaster. There is a drought, and it does not rain. The land is cracked, and the threat of hunger and death hangs over the peasants. The water in the fish pond is flowing, but it belongs to the landlord. In the landlord's eyes, the fish in their fish pond are more valuable than the lives of the peasants. The road facing the peasants is either to wait for death or to struggle. Reality forces Gós to take the lead in a dam-breaking riot. However, because this intense struggle is spontaneous and lacks strict organization and correct leadership, it ultimately fails. Although Gós knocks the landlord's manager into the water, the peasants pay a bloody price: Gós's good friend Joni is shot and killed, and he himself is arrested and imprisoned.

    The film "A Foot of Land" depicts the unfolding of the increasingly sharp struggle between the peasants and the landlords. The spark of revolution is lurking in every village and among countless oppressed people. As the film shows, the fundamental issue of the peasant revolution is how to lead the peasants to organize and completely defeat the landlord class by cutting off the roots. The thorough resolution of this issue is only possible under the leadership of the working-class party – the Hungarian Working People's Party. The second part, "Liberated Land," answers this question.

    "Liberated Land" depicts the significant changes that have taken place in the Hungarian countryside after the heroic and selfless Soviet Red Army liberated Hungary from fascist rule. The film uses specific events to describe how real life is developing at a rapid pace, and complex and fierce struggles are taking place without delay. At this time, Gós is already a staunch Communist Party member. After being released from prison, he returns to his hometown to lead the peasants in establishing people's power. Power belongs to the people, and village Party organizations have been established. However, the landlords and wealthy farmers will never willingly withdraw from the political stage. The dark forces formed by landlords, wealthy farmers, and reactionary priests launch attacks and resistance against the people's power. The reactionary priest uses the Bible's saying "be as fierce, vicious, and cunning as snakes" to deal with the peasants. They seize every opportunity to spread rumors, incite the masses, sabotage water conservancy, assassinate Gós, and even attempt to seize power. But the fate history has arranged for them is destruction. The film depicts their miserable end with irony: the landlord's wife is crying about a toothache, and the reactionary guys are running around like ants on a hot pot, plotting conspiracies, but repeatedly failing. They blame each other and quarrel endlessly. They cannot carry away the land, so they kill the livestock and feast. The scene of them gorging around the table cannot help but make people feel that they are eating their death feast. The majestic momentum of the revolution disperses this evil wind. The people's power is finally established and consolidated in the struggle. The land belongs to the peasants, and the peasants have obtained the land they have longed for.

    In the revolutionary struggle, not only are the enemies of the revolution defeated by the people, but also the backward ideas of the peasants are gradually overcome. The film also provides a summary description of this process. The Party always stands among the people, educating the peasants with advanced ideas, and the struggle of real life also continuously improves the peasants' thinking. The peasants overcome the idea that the revolution has already succeeded after being divided the land and some conservative and backward ideas. The film first depicts the ideological struggle unfolded within the Party. Only by first overcoming the backward ideas of some Party members and through the active actions of Party members among the masses can the Party's leading role among the masses be reflected. Some Party members from peasant backgrounds are unwilling to engage in collective labor, are nostalgic for individual production methods, and want to work temporary jobs; some individual Party members from peasant backgrounds cut down public trees to repair their own houses and even say things like, "My heart follows the Party, but my mind is really confused." The reason why his "heart" and "mind" are not consistent is that he is burdened by selfish thoughts and cannot keep pace with the collective cause. Party members with this kind of thinking were criticized at Party meetings. Marika's initial idea that the struggle was over was also corrected in the intense struggle of reality. She has been tempered from an ordinary rural woman to being able to help Gós with his work. When Gós announced the land decree and the peasants congratulated each other, the Party's district committee secretary, Kovacs, did not forget to remind everyone: "This work has finally been successfully completed, but this achievement is not our ultimate goal." The ultimate goal is communism. Carrying out communist education among the peasants is an important guarantee for the peasants to achieve complete liberation, get rid of capitalist ideas, and move towards communism. Although the depiction of this issue does not take up too many shots in the film, it is very important because it allows peasant audiences to be educated by the film and be wary of the development of similar ideas.

    After watching this film from a brotherly country, our audience will undoubtedly feel a sense of familiarity after understanding the lives and struggles of Hungarian peasants before liberation, because the experiences of our peasants are also similar. This film will not only have a good educational effect on our audience but will also enhance the understanding and friendship between the people of China and Hungary.

    真实描写匈牙利农民斗争生活的影片
    ——介绍“一寸土”“解放了的土地”
    叶遥
    编导者　潘·费立奇　匈牙利电影制片厂出品　上海电影制片厂译制“一寸土”获第四届国际电影节劳动奖
    首次与中国观众见面的匈牙利影片“一寸土”和“解放了的土地”是匈牙利人民电影的优秀影片之一。这部影片是根据匈牙利著名作家帕尔·萨宝的小说“婚礼、洗礼、摇篮”改编的，分为上下两集。它生动地描写了匈牙利农民在解放前后的生活和斗争。
    在上集“一寸土”内，我们看到解放前的匈牙利农民在超经济的剥削下，过着终日劳动而不得温饱的悲惨生活。影片通过对农民高涉和玛丽卡的遭遇的描写，真实地反映了匈牙利解放前的农村情景。
    影片的故事刚一展开，就吸引观众关怀着高涉和玛丽卡的命运。贫农玛丽卡像物品一样被抵偿给她父母的债主，被迫嫁给富农的儿子福克。玛丽卡的爱人高涉也是个贫苦的农民，他虽然救出了玛丽卡，并和她结了婚，但一连串的灾难跟踪而来。
    影片通过一些平常生活的描写，把地主和农民间的矛盾写得非常尖锐。一边是农民高涉廉价地出卖劳动力，作着苦役般的劳动，给地主挖鱼池子、在自己的田地上掘井种菜。玛丽卡在怀孕七个月的时候，还参加推水车、浇菜园的繁重劳动，这都是为了要还清玛丽卡父母的债务和一大笔退婚费。一边是地主的总管克扣工资、侮辱玛丽卡，富农破坏高涉的菜园，要高涉和玛丽卡“受一辈子穷，永远翻不转身来”；廉价收买了玛丽卡父母的房子，使他们无存身之处。总之，地主富农们以给人民制造灾难和不幸为乐。
    高涉和玛丽卡的灾难并没有完结，从旧制度所产生的灾祸，影子似地和他们的命运连在一起，继人祸而来的是天灾。天旱不下雨，土地干裂了，饥饿和死亡的威胁降在农民头上。鱼池子里的水哗哗流着，但那是地主的。在地主看来，他们鱼池子里的鱼比农民的命更值钱。摆在农民面前的路不是等死，就是斗争。现实生活逼迫高涉带头进行了决堤暴动。但由于这场激烈的斗争是自发性的，缺乏严密的组织和正确的领导，所以终于失败了。高涉虽将地主的总管打下水去，但农民也付出了血的代价：高涉的好友强尼被枪杀了，他自己也被捕入狱。
    影片“一寸土”描写了农民和地主之间的日益尖锐的斗争的展开。革命的火种埋伏在每个村庄和无数受压榨的人民中间。像影片所显示的，农民革命的根本问题是如何领导农民组织起来，用斩草除根的办法，彻底打垮地主阶级。这一问题的彻底解决只有在工人阶级的政党——匈牙利劳动人民党领导下才有可能实现。下集“解放了的土地”对这一问题作了回答。
    “解放了的土地”描写了苏联红军英勇无私地将匈牙利从法西斯统治下解放后，匈牙利的农村所起的重大变化。影片以具体的事件，描写了现实生活以急速的步子向前发展着，复杂的、激烈的斗争在刻不容缓地进行。这时，高涉已是个坚强的共产党员，他从狱中出来后即回到家乡领导农民作建立人民政权的工作。政权已归属于人民了，村中的党组织也建立起来了，但地主富农们决不会心甘情愿地退出政治舞台。地主、富农和反动的神父所结成的黑暗集团，向人民的政权发动了进攻和顽抗。他们以反动的神父引用圣经上所说的“要如同毒蛇一般的凶狠、毒辣、智机”的手段来对付农民。他们乘一切可乘的机会来造谣，煽惑群众，破坏水利，暗杀高涉，甚至企图夺取政权。但历史给他们安排好的命运是灭亡。影片以讽刺的手法描写了他们的末日的狼狈相：地主的老婆在叫喊着牙痛，反动的家伙们像热锅上的蚂蚁一样东奔西走策划阴谋，但屡遭失败。他们内部你怨我，我怨你，争吵不休。田地是背不走的，他们便杀掉牲畜大吃大喝，他们围着桌子大嚼的场面，不能不使人感到这是他们在吃临终的丧席。革命的雄伟气势冲散了这股阴风，人民的政权终于在斗争中建立和巩固了，土地归农民所有了，农民获得了渴望已久的土地。
    在革命的斗争中，不但革命的敌人被人民打垮了，而且农民的落后思想也逐渐被克服着。影片对这一过程，也作了扼要的描写。党随时站在人民中间以先进的思想教育农民，现实生活的斗争也使农民的思想不断提高。农民们克服着在分得土地后即认为革命已经成功的思想和一些保守、落后的思想。影片首先描写了党内展开的思想斗争。只有先克服了党内某些党员的落后思想，通过党员在群众中的积极行动，才能体现党在群众中的领导作用。有些农民出身的党员，不愿进行集体的劳动，留恋个体的生产方式，想去打短工；有个别农民出身的党员砍伐公共的树木去修自己的房子，而且还说出：“我的心跟着党，我的思想实在糊涂”一类的话。他的“心”和“思想”所以不一致，是因为他被自私的思想牵累着，才不能与集体的事业合拍。有这种思想的党员在党的会议上受到了批评。玛丽卡最初认为斗争已经结束的思想，也在现实的激烈斗争中得到改正，她从一个普通的农村妇女，锻炼得可以帮助高涉工作了。党的区委书记柯发斯在高涉宣布了土地法令，农民互相祝贺的时候，他还没有忘记提醒大家：“这工作终于胜利完成了，但这成就不是我们最终的目的。”最终的目的是共产主义。在农民中进行共产主义教育，是使农民获得彻底解放、摆脱资本主义思想、向共产主义迈进的重要保证。有关这一问题的描写，在影片中所占的镜头虽然并不算太多，但却是十分重要的，因为它使农民观众从影片里受到教育，警惕自己类似思想的发展。
    我国观众看了这部兄弟国家的片子，看了解放前匈牙利农民的生活和斗争，无疑将发生亲切之感，因为我们农民的遭遇也是相类似的。这部电影不但对我国观众会产生良好的教育作用，也将增强中匈两国人民之间的了解与友谊。
