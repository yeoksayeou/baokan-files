The Central South Military and Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee convened the Central South Region Agricultural Machinery Planning Conference in mid-August. The conference determined that, under the principle of local industry serving agricultural production increase, the agricultural machinery drainage and irrigation事业 should be developed in the Central South Region. The meeting discussed the manufacture and promotion of water pumps, insecticide equipment, and various new agricultural tools from 1953 to 1957, and formulated a specific plan for 1953.

The Central South region has a total of 168.28 million mu of paddy fields, as well as more than 16 million mu of dry land and irrigated land that can be converted into paddy fields. This year, the lakeside areas of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province and Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, as well as other relatively advanced production areas, have a set of experiences of high yield, which proves that if farmland water conservancy is developed, ensuring that farmland receives sufficient irrigation, the unit area yield can generally be increased by 30 to 50 percent on the original production level within one or two years, and in some cases, even more than doubled. Therefore, according to the current farmland water conservancy situation in the Central South region, the conference believes that the focus should still be on vigorously constructing farmland water conservancy projects (gravity irrigation projects and small-scale water storage projects), continuing to expand the irrigated area and enhance irrigation and drought resistance; however, based on the fundamental improvement of the national financial and economic situation and the considerable development of local industry in the Central South region, it is now preliminarily has favorable conditions to develop agricultural machinery drainage and irrigation in a planned and step-by-step manner, vigorously manufacture and promote water pumps, fully utilize water sources, and solve the problem of farmland irrigation and drainage. It is estimated that 30.56 million mu of farmland in the region can be irrigated by machinery, and 2.31 million mu of farmland can be drained by machinery, requiring more than 500,000 horsepower of water pumps. The meeting decided to first manufacture and install 15,000 horsepower of water pumps in two phases in March and October 1953, focusing on establishing water pump stations, creating typical demonstrations, and gaining experience; then gradually develop to 200,000 horsepower of water pumps by 1957, solving the irrigation and drainage problems of 12 million mu of farmland, eliminating the threat of drought and flood, to guarantee increased agricultural production. Regarding the promotion and use of water pumps, irrigation should be the main focus, and drainage should be auxiliary; fixed installation should be the main focus, and mobile use should be auxiliary. The operation of water pumps should be mainly public-owned, supplemented by leading and promoting mass cooperative operation. In addition, during the agricultural slack season, the power of the water pumps can be used to develop rural sideline production according to local conditions and farmers' needs.

The meeting also discussed the manufacture and promotion of new agricultural tools, insecticide equipment, and improved water lifting tools, and formulated manufacturing and promotion plans respectively. The 7-inch walking plow will be universally promoted in all suitable areas of the provinces from this year to 1955. Seeders, cultivators, paddy field weeding machines, and other agricultural tools will also be manufactured and promoted starting in 1953. From next year, each province will increase and establish 30 agricultural tool stations. In the dry land areas of Henan, crops are mainly irrigated by waterwheels and wells to extract groundwater. In 1953, it is planned to promote 15,000 Liberation-style waterwheels and 30 sets of well-drilling machinery, expanding the irrigated area by 450,000 mu. Regarding the promotion of insecticide equipment, sprayers and dusters needed to prevent and control diseases, insect pests, and locusts on 27 million mu of cotton, tobacco, and wheat should be completed by the end of April 1953.

The meeting believes that local industry must serve agricultural production in order to have broad development prospects and make the worker-peasant alliance more solid. According to the equipment and technical conditions of the existing manufacturing factories in the region, the meeting decided that several larger manufacturing factories under the large administrative regions and provinces should undertake the manufacture of water pumps, and the agricultural tool and insecticide equipment manufacturing factories in each province and city should be responsible for manufacturing various new agricultural tools and pesticide machinery. Mechanical repair factories will be established in key areas (special districts or key counties) for the promotion of agricultural machinery. As for the handicraft factories or workshops in towns and rural areas, they should mainly focus on fully supplying ordinary agricultural tools and helping farmers repair old agricultural tools in the future. In this way, each manufacturing factory and handicraft factory will be able to find its place and seek greater development within its respective division of labor. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中南召开农业机械计划会议
    中南军政委员会财政经济委员会在八月中旬召开了中南区农业机械计划会议。会议确定在地方工业为农业增产服务的方针下，发展中南区农业机械排水灌溉事业。会上讨论了从一九五三年到一九五七年五年内制造和推广抽水机、杀虫器械和各种新式农具等事项，并制订了一九五三年的具体计划。
    中南全区共有一亿六千八百二十八万亩水田，还有可以改造成为水田的一千六百多万亩旱田和水浇地。今年湖南省洞庭湖和江西省鄱阳湖的滨湖地区和其他生产比较先进的地区，都有丰产的一套经验证明：如果农田水利有了发展，保证农田得到充足水量灌溉，一、两年内，一般可在原有生产水平上提高单位面积产量百分之三十至五十，高者可达一倍以上。因此，会议根据中南区目前农田水利情况，认为现在仍应以大力兴修农田水利工程（自流灌溉工程和小型蓄水工程）为主，继续扩大灌溉面积并增强灌溉和抗旱效能；但在全国财政经济状况已根本好转，中南区地方工业已有相当发展的基础上，有计划有步骤地发展农业机械排水灌溉事业，大力制造和推广抽水机，充分利用水源，解决农田灌溉、排渍问题，已初步具备了有利条件。据估计：全区可以利用机械灌溉的农田有三千零五十六万亩，利用机械排渍的农田有二百三十一万亩，共需五十多万匹马力的抽水机。会议决定首先在一九五三年三月和十月分两期制造并安装好一万五千匹马力的抽水机，有重点地设立抽水机站，作出典型示范，创造经验；再逐步发展到一九五七年二十万匹马力的抽水机，解决一千二百万亩农田的灌溉和排渍，消除旱涝威胁，以保证农业增产。关于抽水机的推广使用，则以灌溉为主，排渍为辅；以固定设置为主，流动使用为辅。抽水机的经营方式，以公营为主，领导和推动群众合作经营为辅。此外，在农闲期间，可根据当地情况和农民需要，利用抽水机的动力来发展农村副业生产。
    会议还讨论了制造和推广新式农具、杀虫器械和改良提水工具等问题，并分别作出了制造和推广的计划。七吋步犁将从今年起到一九五五年在各省所有适宜地区普遍推广使用。播种机、中耕器、水田锄草器及其他农具也要从一九五三年开始制造和推广。明年起各省将要增设和建立三十个农具站。河南旱地主要依靠水车、水井汲取地下水浇灌作物。一九五三年准备推广解放式水车一万五千辆，凿井机械三十套，扩大浇灌面积四十五万亩。杀虫器械的推广，在一九五三年四月底要完成防治二千七百万亩棉、烟、小麦的病虫和蝗虫所需的喷雾器和喷粉器。
    会议认为地方工业必需为农业生产服务，才能有广阔的发展前途，使工农联盟更加巩固。会议根据全区现有制造工厂的设备和技术条件，决定以大行政区及各省所属几个较大的制造工厂承制抽水机，各省、市农具和杀虫器械制造厂负责制造各种新式农具和药械。凡属农业机械推广的重点地区（专区或重点县），都将要筹设机械修配工厂。至于各城镇和农村手工工厂或作坊，今后应以充分供应普通农具和帮助农民修理旧有农具为主。这样，就使各制造工厂、手工工厂各得其所，进而在各自分工范围内求得更大发展。　（新华社）
