    Jin Kedian Mutual Aid Team Completes Preparations for Wheat Sowing

    Comrade Editor: The season for sowing wheat is approaching. As the saying goes, "One year's crops rely on two years of preparation, and autumn sowing is the most important." This is very true. Our mutual aid team has completed the preparations for wheat sowing.

    Based on our experience, to achieve a bumper wheat harvest, the first requirement is deep plowing to conserve moisture. After harvesting the wheat, we rough-plowed all the land of our team once. Half a month later, we deep-plowed it again with a new-style walking plow. Before the Beginning of Autumn, we plowed it again when applying base fertilizer. Second, increase the application of fertilizer. Before sowing, we applied sufficient base fertilizer (my four mu of high-yield land received six large cartloads of base fertilizer per mu), and we also prepared thirty jin of bean cake and ten jin of bone fertilizer per mu as top dressing. We paid attention to fertilization techniques and plan to apply top dressing in three installments, applying and spreading the base fertilizer evenly before plowing. Third, implement close planting. Last year, I used three more jin of seeds per mu for my wheat, and the yield increased nearly two times compared to the average masses. This year, I plan to use twelve jin of seeds per mu (five jin more than the average farmer) and plan to reduce the row spacing to five inches. Fourth, select superior varieties, soak the seeds, and mix the seeds with pesticides. Last year, we used the No. 60 wheat variety from the farm, and the yield was a quarter higher than ordinary varieties. This year, we will plant this variety on a large scale. When sowing, we will strictly implement warm water soaking and seed mixing with copper sulfate and other agents to prevent various diseases and pests.

    We guarantee to do a good job in this year's wheat sowing and complete next year's wheat bumper harvest plan. My four mu of high-yield dryland wheat will strive to achieve a record of 550 jin per mu.

    晋克典互助组已做好小麦播种前的准备工作
　　编辑同志：种麦的节令快到了。俗语说，“一年庄稼两年闹，秋天下种最重要”，这是很对的。我们互助组已经作好了小麦下种前的准备工作。
    根据我们的经验，要想使小麦丰产，第一要深耕保墒。在割麦后，我们全组的麦地已经粗犁了一遍。隔半月后，我们又用新式步犁深翻了一遍；立秋前上底粪时又耕了一遍。第二，增施肥料。播种前我们上了充足的底粪（我的四亩丰产地每亩上了六大车底粪），每亩还准备了三十斤豆饼和十斤骨肥作追肥。我们注意了施肥技术，准备分三次上追肥，基肥在翻地前上好、撒匀。第三，实行密植。我的小麦去年每亩多用了三斤种籽，产量比一般群众增多将近两倍。今年每亩准备用十二斤种籽（比一般农民多五斤），并准备把行距缩短到五寸。第四，选用良种，浸种、拌种。去年我们用农场的六○号小麦品种，产量比普通品种高出四分之一。今年要大量播种这种品种。下种时还要严格实行温汤浸种和用王铜等药剂拌种，以防治各种病虫害。
    我们保证作好今年的小麦播种工作，完成明年小麦的丰产计划。我的四亩丰产旱地小麦要争取达到每亩生产五百五十斤的纪录。
