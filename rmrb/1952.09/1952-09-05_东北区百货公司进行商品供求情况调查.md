The Northeast China Company of China Department Store, in order to further strengthen the planning of business management and promote the normal development of production, began conducting a survey and research on the supply and demand of commodities in the entire region at the end of June. The company transferred a total of 430 cadres from its affiliated units and students from Jinzhou and Siping Commercial Technical Schools, divided them into 30 groups, and studied the production and sales of 48 major commodities such as flower, yarn, cloth, and clothing in a way that combined learning with doing, and learning with application.

In recent years, the company has not conducted systematic investigation and research on commodities, so it has failed to fully grasp the law of production and sales and market changes, which often makes the work in a passive state. For example, the company has accumulated a lot of socks that do not meet the required specifications and quality, but the socks needed by women are in short supply; in the past, it was thought that bicycles were oversupplied, but after organizing employees to buy them, the sales have been greatly opened up; vulcanized green has been stockpiled in large quantities for a long time, and the inventory continues to increase; the match production plan was once increased last year, but this year it feels too much. This all shows that state-owned trade must improve its operation in order to play the role of regulating supply and demand and promoting production.

The focus of the commodity supply and demand survey, in terms of demand, is to study the complex requirements of consumers based on the improvement of people's living standards and changes in living habits; in terms of production, it is to study the different products of different manufacturers, as well as the situation of goods coming from other places, to fully understand the past and present actual situation, and to grasp the future development trend. It is necessary to accurately grasp the above situation, analyze and study it, in order to formulate the development indicators of the department store business for next year and a longer period. At the same time, according to the problems that have occurred in the past and still exist, formulate the future operating tasks and guidelines, and propose solutions to several fundamental problems in the current work, so as to do a good job in supply in a planned and organized manner, and better serve the needs of production and people's lives.

    东北区百货公司进行商品供求情况调查
    中国百货公司东北区公司为了进一步加强经营管理的计划性，促进生产正常发展，于六月末开始进行全区商品供求情况的调查研究工作。该公司抽调所属单位干部及锦州、四平商业技术学校学生共四百三十名，划分成三十个组，以边做边学、学用一致的方式分别研究花、纱、布、服装等四十八种主要商品的产销情况。
    该公司几年来没有对商品进行系统的调查研究，因而未能全面掌握产销规律和市场变化情况，常常使工作陷于被动状态。例如，公司积压了许多规格质量不合要求的袜子，但妇女需要的袜子却供应不足；过去以为自行车是供过于求的，但经组织职工购买，已大大打开了销路；硫化青已大量积压很久，仍在继续增加库存；去年曾经追加过生产计划的火柴，今年又感到多了。这都说明国营贸易必须改善经营，才能发挥调剂供求、推进生产的作用。
    调查商品供求情况的重点，在需要方面，是根据人民生活水平的提高和生活习惯的变化，研究消费者的复杂要求；在生产方面，则研究不同厂商的不同产品，以及外地来货情况，充分了解过去和现在的实际情形，掌握将来的发展趋势。切实掌握了上述情况，进行分析研究，以制订明年和较长时期的百货业务发展的指标。同时，根据过去曾经发生和目前还存在的问题，制订今后经营的任务和方针，提出解决目前工作中几个根本问题的方案，从而有计划有组织地做好供应工作，更好地为生产和人民生活需要服务。
