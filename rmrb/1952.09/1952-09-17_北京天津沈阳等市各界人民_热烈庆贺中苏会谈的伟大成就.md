Xinhua News Agency: Beijing newspapers on the 16th prominently published the "Communique on the Negotiations between the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Government" with large characters on the front page. People from all walks of life in the city warmly hailed the success of the Sino-Soviet talks. Many factories, institutions, schools, and shops held gatherings. Workers from factories and enterprises such as the North China Agricultural Machinery Branch Factory No. 1, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau, Beijing Qianmen Railway Station, and the Beijing Branch of the China Department Store expressed their determination to further develop the patriotic production increase and economy campaign to support the Sino-Soviet talks communique. Teachers and students from universities such as Peking University and Normal University unanimously expressed their support for the Sino-Soviet communique.

    The staff on the "International Train" traveling between Beijing and Manchuria were particularly excited. Some who were scheduled to depart this morning didn't even bother to rest, and some who had already bought movie tickets didn't go. More than sixty people automatically gathered to listen to Pan Cheng, the section chief of the Beijing Train Section, read the Sino-Soviet communique and the newspaper's editorial. They joyfully expressed their feelings. Train attendant Li Zhihou said: "In the past, when Japan invaded our China, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China to help us defeat Japan. After liberation, the Soviet Union helped our country with construction, building the China Changchun Railway into a model railway for the whole country. Now this railway is to be transferred to China free of charge. At the same time, the Soviet Union has accepted our government's suggestion to extend the period of joint Sino-Soviet use of the Lushunkou naval base. This is entirely for the purpose of opposing American and Japanese aggression, defending the security of China and the Soviet Union, and safeguarding peace in the East and the world." Tao Debin, a model train conductor in the Northeast region, said: "Only the Soviet Union under the leadership of Marshal Stalin can help us so selflessly." Other employees cited many facts about the China Changchun Railway from their own experiences, explaining the great friendship of the Soviet government and the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. They expressed that they would use practical actions to support the Sino-Soviet talks communique.

    People from the literary and art circles, industrial and commercial circles, and ethnic minorities in Beijing also expressed their heartfelt support for the Sino-Soviet talks communique. Wang Yaping, Secretary-General of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Workers, Lian Kuoru from the Quyi circle, Qiu Shengrong and Li Fengyang from the Peking Opera circle, and Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, and others issued written statements, praising the great selfless friendship of the Soviet Union and the increasing strength of the Sino-Soviet alliance.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th: After the publication of the Sino-Soviet talks communique, the broad masses of the people in Tianjin felt infinitely excited, and people from all walks of life issued statements to express their congratulations.

    Huang Songling, Vice President of the Tianjin Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, said: "The measures taken as a result of the Sino-Soviet talks will further strengthen the great power of the Sino-Soviet alliance and are of great significance for consolidating peace in the East and world peace. The people of Tianjin will further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, learn the noble internationalist spirit of the Soviet people, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in various work posts, and celebrate this measure of great historical significance with practical actions." Pan Changyou, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, said: "All the workers in our Tianjin express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the great Comrade Stalin. The workers of Tianjin have had a particularly deep experience of the selfless spirit of the Soviet Union in the past three years. Soviet experts have made great contributions to our country's industrial construction. Our steel plant's hot repair of the Martin furnace was successfully repaired with the direct assistance of Soviet experts. We must step up production and complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and live up to the care and help of Comrade Stalin and the Soviet people." Wang Shilin, a national model worker and vice chairman of the trade union of the private Hengyuan Textile Factory, said: "The two measures announced in the Sino-Soviet communique are of great help to our country's economic construction and consolidating national defense. This further encourages the employees of our entire factory to do a good job in the production increase and economy campaign. We must strive to victoriously complete the factory's production increase and economy plan of 100 billion yuan for this year." Bian Jieqing, manager of the private Hengyuan Textile Factory, said: "This is good news. The transfer of the China Changchun Railway to our country fully demonstrates the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's concern for our country's economic construction." He expressed his support for the exchange of notes extending the period of joint Sino-Soviet use of the Lushunkou naval base. Zhang Huakan, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Engineers Association, said: "The extension of the joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou naval base is a powerful guarantee for stopping the aggressive behavior of the United States and Japan."

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th: After the Sino-Soviet talks communique was transmitted here at noon today, the people of the city were extremely happy and inspired. People frequently shouted: "Thank you, Soviet Union!" "Long live Marshal Stalin!" "Long live the great Sino-Soviet friendship!"

    People from all walks of life issued statements to our reporter to express their warm support. Gao Chongmin, Vice President of the Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, first expressed his warm congratulations on the great achievements of the Sino-Soviet talks in a written statement. He said: "The talks communique once again demonstrates to the world that the friendship between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly consolidated and strengthened. We are extremely grateful for the Soviet people's consistent brotherly and selfless assistance to the Chinese people. I wholeheartedly support the extension of the period of joint use of the Lushunkou naval base, which is an important measure to defend peace in the East and the world, to defend the security of China and the Soviet Union, and to prevent the resurgence of Japanese militarism." The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions stated in its statement:

    "In the past three years, the working class in the Northeast, with the direct assistance of Soviet experts, has learned various advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and accelerated the pace of our country's economic construction. In particular, the China Changchun Railway, which is jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, has developed even faster and has become one of the most advanced enterprises in the country. Today, the Soviet government is transferring it to our country, once again demonstrating the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country."
    Ning Wu, Director of the Northeast Temporary Working Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued a statement saying: "Just as the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference is about to open in Beijing, the success of the Sino-Soviet talks is a new and heavy blow to the US imperialists' conspiracy to expand their aggressive war, and is a major contribution to ensuring security in the Far East and the world." Chen Yingqian, Vice President of the China Medical University, especially mentioned in his speech that the ambition of the United States to collude with Japanese militarists to expand the scourge of aggressive war is increasing unabated. Under this new situation, the extension of the period of joint use of the Lushunkou naval base by China and the Soviet Union is a correct and wise measure to safeguard lasting peace in the Far East and the world. Jin Shuliang, Dean of the Northeast Institute of Technology, said: "In the past few years, the China Changchun Railway has achieved great results because of the participation of Soviet experts in management. The Soviet Union's transfer of the China Changchun Railway to our country free of charge fully demonstrates that the Soviet Union is our country's selfless friendly country."

    After the Sino-Soviet talks communique was transmitted to the Rubber Factory No. 4, which won the title of Advanced Factory in Shenyang, the entire factory was filled with drums, and the workers held gatherings to celebrate. Female worker Lü Huibin said at the meeting: "After hearing the news that the Soviet Union was going to transfer the China Changchun Railway to our country and extend the period of joint use of the Lushunkou naval base, I have a deeper understanding of the Soviet Union's sincere friendship towards our country, and the unity between China and the Soviet Union will be even more consolidated." The workers warmly supported her speech, shouting: "Long live the Sino-Soviet friendly unity!" "Long live Marshal Stalin, the standard-bearer of peace and victory!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The workers unanimously expressed at the meeting: In order to celebrate the achievements of the Sino-Soviet talks and welcome the National Day and the convening of the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference, they are determined to strive to complete the factory's annual production increase and economy plan worth 23,000 tons of sorghum by the end of September. National-renowned labor model Ma Hengchang and twenty-four others held a symposium at the Shenyang Workers' and Peasants' Quick School to celebrate the success of the Sino-Soviet talks. Ma Hengchang said: "The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played an important role in safeguarding world peace, and the success of the Sino-Soviet talks today will further consolidate world peace." Female train driver Tian Guiying said: "Soviet experts have taught us their accumulated experience over the years without reservation. The China Changchun Railway has become a school for training our country's railway cadres. I was trained in this school. I am very grateful to the Soviet Union for transferring the China Changchun Railway to our country free of charge." Northeast Railway labor model Zheng Xikun, Du Xianyang, and coal mining expert Zhang Zifu and others unanimously believed at the symposium: Only the Soviet Union can help our country so selflessly. They also expressed their determination to study culture hard so as to further learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
