    Fighting for Peace
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Cui Jianguo
    For us, the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the most precious words are "peace." Because we know what price we have paid for peace. In the most difficult times on the Korean front, we ate snow, fried flour, and wild vegetables—we did it for peace. We advanced through chest-deep rapids under heavy fire—we did it for peace. Carrying eighty-odd pounds of supplies and ammunition, we marched three hundred and sixty *li* in three nights of forced march—we did it for peace. Encountering a minefield, I embraced the determination to sacrifice myself, stepping on a mine with one foot and picking up other mines with my hands. At that time, what I thought was that millions of people would thus gain peace. One of our comrades, wounded but refusing to leave the front line, threw his last grenade and handed over his last Party membership dues. When he sacrificed himself, he shouted, "For world peace!" For peace, how many precious lives have we sacrificed! For peace, we are still fighting. Once, my platoon captured more than eighty trucks from the American invaders. We discovered that three of them were loaded with banknotes intended for use after the occupation of China. The American invaders were confident that they could fight all the way to China! We must not forget what the American imperialists are thinking and doing. We must fight until victory.
    On the Korean front, what we Volunteer Army comrades love to talk about most is our motherland and our hometowns, and peaceful construction. Indeed, our motherland is truly lovable, and the progress of peaceful construction in our motherland is truly rapid. I once returned to my hometown in Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi. My hometown had changed so much that I hardly recognized it. San’gai Village, five *li* away from my home, used to be a large open space next to the village; now, a main street has been built, with offices of the agricultural production cooperative, cooperatives, oil mills, and dyeing houses on both sides. Since I was old enough to understand things, the farmers with the best lives in our village had to eat bran at least once a day. This time when I went back, I walked all over the village and visited several other villages. Every family was eating rice and white flour. In the past, they couldn't even afford coarse cloth; now, everyone has one or two sets of fine cloth clothes. The girls even wore floral calico shirts and new blue cloth workers' hats. I personally participated in the "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day" celebrated by some villages on the first and fifteenth of each month. On that day, every household got up early and put up the national flag on the flagpole in front of the gate. Every house was cleaned spotlessly, and people put on new clothes and went to the village to attend meetings. At the meeting, the whole village checked how the patriotic production plan was being implemented and how the patriotic health campaign was going. Good deeds were praised, and bad ones were criticized. They also checked the work of supporting the families of soldiers and tilling land on their behalf. The meeting was both solemn and lively, almost like our meetings on the front line. I also visited some factories. Our worker comrades are working hard to create wealth for the motherland. Many things that could not be made in the past, such as cars and locomotives, can now be made by ourselves. Our industrial and agricultural production are progressing rapidly. For example, in the past, farmers used livestock to pull waterwheels to irrigate the land, and irrigating twenty *mu* a day was considered hard work; now, using water pumps, dozens of *mu* can be irrigated in an hour. From this, it can be seen that our country's future is unlimited. We not only love our present but also love our beautiful future even more. For the future, we must build. For construction, we need peace. For peace, we are willing to fight to the death.
    Now, it is the eve of our country's large-scale construction, and it is the time when we celebrate the third National Day. The Asian and Pacific Peace Conference will be held in the capital. The peace representatives of 1.6 billion people from both sides of Asia and the Pacific can come to the capital of New China to discuss peace issues. This is inseparable from the victory of the war to resist America and aid Korea over the past two years. We are very happy that we have directly and indirectly contributed a little to the peace conference. At this conference, representatives from various countries will further see who is launching wars and destroying peace, and who is stopping wars and defending peace. We should expose the true face of the warmongers in front of the people of the world and expose their deception and intimidation. As some American soldiers on the Korean battlefield said well: Let Truman and Acheson come to fight and stand guard! If the people of the world unite to defend peace, that small group of warmongers will not be able to launch a world war.
    We will support the convening of the conference with concrete actions on the Korean front. We wish the conference a complete success!

    为和平而战斗
    志愿军战斗英雄  崔建国
    对于我们志愿军来说，最珍贵的字眼是和平。因为我们知道为了和平我们付出了什么样的代价。在朝鲜前线最艰苦的时候，我们吃雪、吃炒面、吃野菜，我们为了和平；在齐胸深的急流中我们冒着炮火前进，我们为了和平；背着八十多斤重的给养弹药，我们三夜急行军三百六十多里，我们为了和平；遇到地雷阵，我抱着牺牲自己的决心，一脚踏住地雷，双手取起雷来，那时候我心里想的是千千万万人将因此而得到和平。我们的一个同志挂了花，负伤不下火线，投出最后的手榴弹，交出最后的党费，他牺牲时高喊着“为了全世界的和平！”为了和平，我们付出了多少宝贵的生命！为了和平，我们还在战斗着。有一次，我的一个排缴获了美国侵略者八十多辆卡车。我们发现其中三辆装的是准备侵占中国以后使用的钞票。美国侵略者满以为他们可以一直打到中国哩！我们不能忘记美帝国主义所想的是什么，所作的是什么，我们必须战斗到胜利。
    在朝鲜前线，我们志愿军同志最爱谈的，是祖国和家乡，是和平建设。的确，我们的祖国真是可爱，祖国的和平建设进步真快。我曾经回山西长治专区的家乡一趟。家乡变得使我连认都认不出来了。离我家五里地的伞盖村，村边原是一块大空场；如今修起了十字大街，两边是农业生产合作社办公室和合作社、油坊、染坊的房子。自从我懂事起，我们村生活最好的农民每天也要吃一顿糠。这一次我回去，走遍全村，还串了好几个村，家家吃的是米饭、白面。过去连粗布也穿不上，如今那个也有一两套细布衣服。闺女们还都穿了花洋布衫，戴上新蓝布的工人帽。我亲自参加了一些村庄每月初一、十五过的“抗美援朝爱国日”。那一天，家家户户一早起来，在大门前的旗杆上插上了国旗。各家都打扫得干干净净，人们换上新衣服，到村里开会。在会上全村检查爱国生产计划执行得怎么样，爱国卫生运动搞得如何。好的表扬，坏的批评。还检查优军、代耕的工作。会开得又严肃又热闹，和我们在前线开会差不多。我又参观过一些工厂。我们的工人同志正在紧张地为祖国创造财富。许多过去不能造的东西，如汽车、火车头，现在都能自己造了。我们的工农业生产都在飞速进步。比如，过去农村用牲口拉水车浇地，一天浇二十亩是顶紧的活；如今用水泵，一小时能浇几十亩地。由此可见，我们国家的前途是无限的。我们不独爱我们的现在，而且更爱我们美好的将来。为了将来，我们要建设。为了建设，我们要和平。为了和平，我们愿意舍身奋斗。
    现在，正是我们国家要开始大规模建设的前夕，正是我们庆祝第三届国庆节的时候，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将要在首都召开。亚洲及太平洋两岸十六亿人民的和平代表，能够来到新中国首都来开会讨论和平问题，这是和两年来的抗美援朝战争的胜利分不开的。我们很高兴我们为和平会议直接、间接地尽了一点力量。在这个会议上，各国的代表们将进一步看到究竟是谁发动战争、破坏和平；是谁在制止战争、保卫和平。我们应该在全世界人民面前揭穿战争贩子的真面目，揭破它的欺骗和恐吓。在朝鲜战场上有的美国大兵说得好：让杜鲁门、艾奇逊他们来打仗、放哨吧！如果全世界人民团结起来保卫和平，那一小撮战争贩子，是发动不起世界大战的。
    我们将在朝鲜前线以具体行动支持会议的召开。预祝会议的胜利成功！
