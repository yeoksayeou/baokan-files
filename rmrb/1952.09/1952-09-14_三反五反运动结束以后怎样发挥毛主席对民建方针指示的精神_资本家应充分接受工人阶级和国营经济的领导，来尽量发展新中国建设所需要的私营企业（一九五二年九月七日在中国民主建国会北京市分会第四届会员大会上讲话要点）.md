Title: How to Carry Forward the Spirit of Chairman Mao's Instructions on the Policy Towards the Democratic National Construction Association After the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns: Capitalists Should Fully Accept the Leadership of the Working Class and the State-Owned Economy to Develop Private Enterprises as Much as Possible to Meet the Needs of New China's Construction (Main Points of a Speech at the Fourth Membership Congress of the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association on September 7, 1952)

Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Huang Yanpei

During my conversation with Chairman Mao on March 15 this year, he gave some instructions on our work, including the following key points:

First, private capital has made contributions to the construction of New China; we just shouldn't let it develop in a bad direction.

Second, capitalists cannot only seek private gain, but must also take into account the interests of the country and the workers.

Third, we must unite, educate, and transform them well, and first study and implement the Common Program.

How clear Chairman Mao's instructions are! How much encouragement they give us! They make us feel like we have discovered a new life, and of course we will follow them wholeheartedly. Where should we start? I think we should start with education and transformation.

What should we educate and transform? Starting from the basics, it should be the transformation of thought. What kind of thought should we transform into? It should be the thought of patriotism and the Common Program.

The People's Democratic United Front is led by the working class. The Common Program was formulated by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference under the leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party of China).

There are bad and good elements among the bourgeoisie. As for the majority of the bourgeoisie, if a person's thinking has bad aspects, we should help him remove them; if there are good aspects, we should help him develop them. These good aspects possess a factor that can accept patriotism and the Common Program.

Encouraging people of the bourgeoisie to study and transform is not to ask them to change their class status, but only to help them transform those bad thoughts, those thoughts that do not conform to patriotism and the Common Program, the so-called five poisons.

Only by accepting the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy can the bourgeoisie make good use of private capital to develop production undertakings that are beneficial to the people and the country. For the sake of the bourgeoisie's own interests, only by accepting the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy can it be ensured that there will be no problems between labor and capital, and that the enterprise can develop steadily.

Of course, when thoughts change, life will follow suit. In the future, class status may also follow suit. But if their thinking is truly cleared up and they clearly see the requirements of New China's construction, these good bourgeois elements will certainly continue to be valued and will not rush to demand a change in their class status.

This is our requirement for the majority of the bourgeoisie at the present stage. However, under the conditions of China, those few far-sighted people among the bourgeoisie may exceed the above requirements and accept the basic ideas of the working class, that is, socialist ideas, and thus become interested in the socialist cause. While they run factories, they do not demand an immediate change in their status and business; at the same time, they see the great contribution of the socialist cause to mankind and want to become socialists in the future. Such people are possible, and we should welcome them.

Our requirement for the general national bourgeoisie is that when the grand plan for the economic construction of the People's Republic of China is about to begin, everyone should fully accept the leadership of the working class and the state-owned economy to develop the production undertakings necessary for the construction of New China as much as possible. This is a major contribution of the bourgeoisie to the country and the people, and it also conforms to Chairman Mao's earnest expectations for the good elements of the progressive bourgeoisie.

    三反五反运动结束以后怎样发挥毛主席对民建方针指示的精神
    资本家应充分接受工人阶级和国营经济的领导，来尽量发展新中国建设所需要的私营企业
    （一九五二年九月七日在中国民主建国会北京市分会第四届会员大会上讲话要点）
    中国民主建国会总会主任委员　黄炎培
    今年三月十五日毛主席和我谈话时，曾对我们的工作有所指示，中间包含若干要点：
    一、私人资本在新中国建设上是有贡献的；只不要让它向坏的方面发展。
    二、不能让资本家光是图私人的利，必须兼顾国家的利、工人的利。
    三、很好地团结他们，教育他们，改造他们，先学习并实行共同纲领。
    毛主席的指示多么明确！给我们多么大的鼓舞！使我们恍惚发见了新的生命，我们当然全心全意地照着做。从那里做起呢？我想应从教育改造做起。
    教育改造什么？从基本下手，应该是改造思想。改造成那种思想？应该是爱国主义的思想，共同纲领的思想。
    人民民主统一战线是以工人阶级为领导的。共同纲领就是在工人阶级（经过中国共产党）领导之下，由人民政协制定的。
    资产阶级分子有坏的，也有好的。就资产阶级大多数人来说，一个人的思想有坏的方面，我们应该帮助他去掉；有好的方面应该帮助他发展。这些好的方面，具备着一种因素，能够接受爱国主义和共同纲领。
    鼓励资产阶级的人们学习、改造，不是要求他们转变成分，而只是帮助他们改造那些坏思想，那些不合乎爱国主义和共同纲领的思想，即所谓五毒思想。
    资产阶级只有接受了工人阶级和国营经济的领导，才能好好地利用私人资本来发展有利于人民和国家的生产事业。为资产阶级自身利益计算，也只有接受了工人阶级和国营经济的领导，才能保证劳资不会有问题，而事业得以稳步进展。
    当然，思想改变了，接下来生活会跟着改变。在将来，阶级成分也可能跟着改变。但是他们的思想如果真的搞通，看清楚了新中国建设的要求，这些好的资产阶级分子就一定会继续受到重视、不会急急于要求他们改变自己的阶级成分的。
    我们在现阶段对资产阶级多数人的要求是这样。但在中国的条件下，资产阶级中间那些少数有远见的人们，可能超过上述要求，而接受工人阶级的基本思想，即社会主义思想，因而对社会主义事业发生兴趣。他们一面开工厂，并不要求马上变更自己的成分和事业；一面看到社会主义事业对于人类的伟大贡献，想在将来做一个社会主义者。这种人是可能有的，我们对他们应该表示欢迎。
    我们对于一般民族资产阶级分子，只要求他们在中华人民共和国经济建设大计划即将开始的时候，大家充分接受工人阶级和国营经济的领导，来尽量发展新中国建设所必需的生产事业。这就是资产阶级对国家和人民的重大贡献，同时也就符合了毛主席对前进的资产阶级好分子的殷厚的期望。
