Review of the Play "Accusation" and Opinions Arising Therefrom
By Song Zhi's, published in "Drama" monthly, issues 2 and 3, and "Liberation Army Literature and Art" April issue
By Yuan Shuipai

Editor's Note: After the play "Accusation" was published, it was performed in many places and achieved certain results, but it also had shortcomings. This newspaper held a discussion on the play on July 25th, attended by: Ding Ling, Lin Mohan, Chen Yi, Cao Yu, Zhang Geng, Yan Wenjing, Chen Qixia, Guang Weiran, Jiao Juyin, Zhong Dianfei, Chen Qitong, Feng Zi, and comrades from the editorial departments of Guangming Daily, Xinmin News, and "Drama Monthly," totaling more than ten people. This article was written by the author after attending the discussion.

It is one of the important tasks that the Party and the people require writers to complete: for literary and artistic workers to use their high political enthusiasm and appropriate artistic forms to quickly reflect important events and movements in the current lives of the people, and to effectively mobilize and educate the people. The efforts of Comrade Song Zhi's, the author of "Accusation," in this regard are worthy of encouragement.

During the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the masses urgently needed singing materials. After "Accusation" was published, it was staged in more than 200 places including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, which shows that although it has shortcomings, and serious shortcomings, it still met the needs of the time and somewhat satisfied the urgent demands of the masses.

The shocking facts revealed in the anti-embezzlement movement about some unscrupulous merchants harming the Volunteer Army proved that the "five poisons" behavior of illegal merchants over the past three years has been very serious. They only seek profit, harm others to benefit themselves, and have reached the point of betraying the country and helping the enemy. Their bloody crimes angered the people of the whole country. At this time, "Accusation" wrote these facts and expressed the anger of the broad masses, which could play a mobilizing role. It depicts the unscrupulous capitalist Jiang Shaoting's frantic attack on the working class, his conspiracy to "send in" and "pull out" spies, his means of intimidation and fraud, his alliance with embezzlers, his framing of workers, and his shameless face of desperate sophistry. The play also depicts how the working class victoriously smashed the attack of the unscrupulous merchants. Although the exposure of the unscrupulous merchants is not profound enough, it has already roughly portrayed the face of an unscrupulous capitalist on the stage and exposed the dark side of the bourgeoisie, which is of certain educational significance to the audience.

But at the same time, the audience also expressed dissatisfaction and made criticisms. Some of these are well-founded and correct.

The outstanding and serious shortcoming of the play is that the embezzler, who is the protagonist, gives people the impression that he can be forgiven and sympathized with, as if this embezzler does not bear serious responsibility for his crime. The character Shu Weiqing and his experiences created and described by the author lack typicality and educational significance.

The large number of embezzlement behaviors exposed in this movement have their social and old ideological roots. Premier Zhou pointed out that embezzlement "has had a history of thousands of years in Chinese class society and has a deep social foundation." The frantic attack of the bourgeoisie is an objective reason for the embezzlement of some cadres, but this does not mean that those embezzlers themselves have no responsibility. The bad thoughts and bad habits they were stained with in the old society are precisely the subjective factors that caused their embezzlement. The author emphasized the attack of the unscrupulous merchants and almost completely failed to show the embezzler's own responsibility. This kind of description reflects the author's one-sidedness in his view of this issue.

Everyone knows that after liberation, the old social foundation has been changed, but the old ideas generated from this foundation still remain in people's minds and have not been completely eliminated, nor can they be completely eliminated all at once. Writers should faithfully and profoundly reflect how people in the new society fight against old ideas, how they transform their old ideas, how they resist the invasion of old ideas, or how they are still bound and captured by old ideas. Writers should convincingly show the inevitability of the victory of new ideas to educate the masses. If not, but instead writing the embezzlement behavior of a petty-bourgeois intellectual who has newly joined the work of the agency as if it has no social foundation and ideological roots, and writing him as being "relatively pure" in his thoughts even though he "mingled in the old society for a few years," and only lacking "development" in politics, so that his bribery is completely passive, and he is dragged into the water by unscrupulous merchants after being poisoned and comatose. Such a character and event are not only not typical, but also cannot explain the poisoning effect of old ideas on a person, and therefore cannot explain why intellectuals, especially those who have been deeply influenced by the old society, must transform their ideas, and why the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements are essentially movements to draw a clear line between the proletarian and bourgeois ideologies.

Some people believe that this kind of writing shows that the cadres' embezzlement is mainly due to the bourgeoisie's attack, and therefore shows that the author's class viewpoint is clear. This is a one-sided view. Pointing out the objective reasons for the phenomenon of embezzlement and taking a strict attitude towards the crimes of embezzlers are two different things. Although some embezzlers may be completely dragged into the water, since he is embezzling, his behavior is still shameful and cannot be sympathized with. Moreover, even for petty embezzlers, before he has completely reformed himself, while he is still captured by bourgeois ideas, absolving such embezzlers of their guilt is precisely blurring the class viewpoint. Moreover, the type of embezzler selected by the author is an untransformed petty-bourgeois old technician, rather than another type, that is, an old cadre who has been tempered by the revolution in the past, but lacks vigilance against the bourgeoisie's "sugar-coated bullets" after entering the city, and therefore degenerates. Different descriptive methods should be adopted for these two different types of characters and cannot be confused.

Another opinion is that this kind of writing can play a role for the embezzlers who have not confessed at that time, that is, it carried out the policy propaganda of "leniency for those who confess." This statement is also incorrect. "Leniency for those who confess" refers to the guiding principle of handling cases. We can show that embezzlers are treated leniently for voluntarily confessing, but we cannot therefore deny the sinfulness and shamefulness of his behavior, let alone relax the serious criticism of embezzlers in the work. Without this, the work cannot produce a great educational effect.

In the play depicting the anti-corruption struggle, the idea of "all embezzlement is illegal" (Bo Yibo) was not publicized, and the sinfulness and shamefulness of embezzlement were not severely criticized. On the contrary, the passive situation of embezzlers' crimes was overemphasized, so that people felt as if embezzlers could be forgiven, or even worthy of sympathy. This has to be said to be a serious shortcoming of the play "Accusation". Moreover, Shu Weiqing's acceptance of bribes and abandonment of the inspection of 150,000 sets of emergency kits caused undue sacrifices to the Volunteer Army. What a serious crime this is! Even if it is not due to bribery, but only due to dereliction of duty, it must be severely punished. How can such a person be written as an almost sympathetic or forgivable character?

In terms of character creation, in addition to the errors in the description of Shu Weiqing, the other characters, such as the unscrupulous merchant Jiang Shaoting and several positive characters, have not been well written and lack relatively profound characterization.

The description of Jiang Shaoting is relatively superficial, with more external uglification than spiritual and character portrayal. His inner life, his extremely corrupt and depraved, profit-only, and unscrupulous bourgeois thoughts have not been unearthed, and how he uses bourgeois thoughts to corrupt cadres has not been shown. The audience only sees him playing some not-so-"clever" tricks. Although such descriptions are also needed and can indeed play some propaganda and educational roles, it is far from enough, and there is still a distance from the goal of creating a typical image of an unscrupulous capitalist.

Director Ma appeared in the play as the embodiment of the policies of the Party and the government. The author's description of him has both shortcomings and inappropriate exaggerations from the surface. The author wrote more about the side of his life as a leader who is busy in the office handling official affairs and constantly giving orders, and did not vividly show his side of connecting with the masses. The author tried his best to render Director Ma's brilliance, that is, to emphasize the leading role of the Party, but he made excessive exaggerations of him. The audience cannot see any sufficient reasons for his judgment. Although the development of the plot proves his correctness, it seems to be an artificial arrangement, and it is not clear that this development is in line with the logic of real life. Therefore, the author originally wanted to show his brilliance, but instead made people feel his arbitrariness; originally wanted to show his "decisiveness," but instead seemed to be hasty. Contrary to the author's original intention, many viewers regarded Director Ma as a person with bureaucratic flavor, which is not without reason. Of course, the actor's relatively rigid performance should also bear some responsibility [Note 1]. In addition, the image of the workers who are the main force of the "Five-Anti" struggle has not been well written. It can be seen that the author is not familiar enough with workers and workers' lives.

In terms of structure, the shortcoming of the play is: the problem of how to combine the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" in the description was not handled well. There is an opinion that the shortcoming of the play is due to the mixing of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" [Note 2]. The problem is not here. Precisely because the two movements are closely linked, and the movement from the internal organs to the society is an important development with great political significance, the play can and should reflect this reality. But structurally, the confession of the embezzler in "Accusation" seems to be written only for the author's attempt to show this plot, and it is not a key to the development of the plot, and it is not closely linked with the exposure of the unscrupulous merchant. The unscrupulous merchant's crimes and evidence have long been found from other clues, and the embezzler's confession or not has little effect from the perspective of the plot development. This artistic shortcoming of the play also causes it to reverse the weight of the description of the two movements. The theme of the play is anti-theft and accusing unscrupulous merchants, but it describes the transformation of embezzlers more.

There are also other creative oversights, for example: Director Ma, who leads the "Three-Anti" in the leading organs in the play, also leads the "Five-Anti" in private factories. This is inconsistent with the regulations that the inspection team of private factories is under the unified leadership of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee. This is an error concerning policy issues.

"Accusation" was performed in the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and it played a certain educational role in exposing the rampant attacks of unscrupulous capitalists to some extent, but it also has the above-mentioned relatively serious ideological and artistic shortcomings. It is necessary to analyze and criticize these shortcomings, which is beneficial to the audience and the author. But it must be pointed out that some of the criticisms at that time also made one-sided, generalized, and simplistic mistakes. For example, someone raised the question of "who is accusing" [Note 3], suspecting that it was not the working class who was accusing the unscrupulous merchants and leading the counterattack against the unscrupulous merchants. The critic saw that Shu Weiqing was the first to accuse the unscrupulous merchants at the struggle meeting, and thought that only the embezzlers were accusing. This criticism is wrong. Obviously, who accuses first and who accuses later at the meeting is not an important issue. All those in the play who oppose unscrupulous capitalists are accusers. The working class leads the "Five-Anti" movement and carries out a serious struggle against unscrupulous capitalists. This point is clear in the play.

Some criticisms believe that the play shows that "female cadres use tenderness to make their husbands confess", which becomes "the basic condition for the victory of the movement" and "does not conform to the facts"; they believe that "this kind of tender action is actually more effective than the education of the leadership and the help of the masses" [Note 4]. This criticism is also wrong. In this movement, there were a large number of similar facts, that is, the family's persuasion became a turning point for an embezzler to confess. Describing that family work finally played a role will not deny or reduce the power of the entire movement. Obviously, the reason why the family can play a role, and the reason why the family can stand on the side of the people instead of on the side of the embezzlers to help the movement, is also because the family has been educated by the Party and the masses. It is completely unnecessary to describe it this way in the work: to educate everyone, regardless of what class he belongs to, regardless of his degree of consciousness, and regardless of the specific situation, in the same way. This is obviously a mechanical view.

There is also an opinion that Shu Weiqing's pure technical point of view has not been criticized [Note 5]. Obviously, to express the criticism of a certain wrong idea of a character in the work, it is not necessary to adopt the method of long reasoning. The plot itself and the results of its development criticize that wrong point of view.

The play "Accusation" was written when the "Three-Anti" movement was not over and the "Five-Anti" movement had just begun. At that time, the law of the movement itself was not obvious enough, and there were indeed many difficulties in writing. When we evaluate this play, we should take this situation into account. But we cannot excuse the play's problems for this reason. The good effects produced by this play must be affirmed, and its shortcomings must also be pointed out. Only in this way can we truly help the development and improvement of literary and artistic creation.

    评话剧“控诉”和由此引起的一些意见
    宋之的作　载“剧本”月刊二、三月号及“解放军文艺”四月号
    袁水拍
    编者按：“控诉”剧本发表后曾在很多地方演出，收到了一定的效果，但它也存在着缺点。本报于七月二十五日召开了一次关于这个剧本的讨论会，出席者：丁玲、林默涵、陈沂、曹禺、张庚、严文井、陈企霞、光未然、焦菊隐、锺惦棐、陈其通、凤子以及光明日报、新民报、“剧本月刊”等编辑部同志共十余人。本文是作者参加讨论会后所写的。
    文学艺术家以其高度的政治热情，运用适当的文艺形式迅速反映当前人民生活中的重要事件和运动，有效地鼓动和教育人民，这是党和人民要求作家完成的重要任务之一。“控诉”作者宋之的同志在这方面的努力是值得鼓励的。
    在伟大的“三反”“五反”运动中，群众迫切要求演唱材料。“控诉”发表后，北京、天津、上海、广州等二百多处相继上演这个剧，说明了它虽然有缺点，并且有严重的缺点，也还是适应了当时的需要，多少满足了群众的迫切要求的。
    在反盗窃运动中揭露出来的一些奸商暗害志愿军的骇人听闻的事实，证明了三年来不法奸商的“五毒”行为是十分严重的，他们唯利是图，损人利己，已经达到叛国助敌的地步。他们的血腥罪行激怒了全国人民。在这个时候，“控诉”写出这些事实，将广大群众的愤怒表达出来，是能起鼓动作用的。它描写了不法资本家蒋绍庭向工人阶级进攻的猖狂性，他的“派进来”“拉出去”布置坐探的阴谋，他的恫吓诈骗的手段，他和贪污分子订“攻守同盟”，他向工人栽赃，以及他的抵死狡赖的无耻面目。剧本也描写了工人阶级怎样胜利地粉碎奸商的进攻。尽管在暴露奸商方面还不深刻，却多少已经在舞台上粗略地画出了一个不法资本家的面目，揭露了资产阶级的黑暗的一面，这对于观众是有一定的教育意义的。
    但同时，观众也表示了不满足，提出了批评。其中有些是有充分理由的、正确的。
    剧本的突出的严重的缺点是它所描写的作为主角的贪污分子，给人以可以宽恕和同情的印象，仿佛这个贪污分子对自己的犯罪并不负有严重的责任。作者所创造和描写的舒渭清这个人物及其遭遇是缺乏典型性的，缺乏教育意义的。
    此次运动中所暴露出来的大量贪污行为，是有其社会的根源和旧思想的根源的。周总理曾指出贪污“在中国的阶级社会中，已经有了几千年的历史，是有着深厚的社会基础的。”资产阶级的猖狂进攻是造成某些干部贪污的客观原因，但这并不是说那些贪污分子本身毫无责任，他们在旧社会中所玷染的坏思想、坏作风正是造成他们贪污的主观因素。作者强调了奸商的进攻，几乎完全不表现贪污分子本身的责任，这样的描写，反映了作者在这一问题的看法上犯了片面性的毛病。
    大家都知道，解放后，旧的社会基础是变革了，从这个基础所产生的旧思想却还残存在人们的头脑中，并没有彻底消灭，也不可能一下子彻底消灭。作家应该忠于现实地、深刻地反映新社会中的人物怎样和旧思想作斗争，怎样改造自己的旧思想，打退旧思想的侵袭，或者怎样依旧被旧思想所束缚和俘掳。作家应该将新思想的胜利的必然性，令人信服地表现出来，以教育群众。如果不是这样，而是把一个没有经过改造的新参加机关工作的小资产阶级知识分子的贪污行为写成仿佛没有社会的基础和思想的根源，并且把他写成虽则“在旧社会混过几年”，思想上却“比较纯洁”，只是政治上不够“开展”，因而他的受贿完全是被动的，是在中毒昏迷后被奸商硬拖下水的。这样一个人物和事件不但没有典型性，而且，也不能说明旧思想对于一个人的毒害作用，因而也就不能说明知识分子、特别是受旧社会影响较深的人们为什么必须改造思想，为什么伟大的“三反”“五反”运动，实质上是划清无产阶级与资产阶级思想界限的运动。
    有人认为这样写，说明了干部的贪污主要是由于资产阶级的进攻，因而表现了作者的阶级观点明确。这是片面的看法。指出造成贪污现象的客观原因和对待贪污分子的罪行采取严厉的态度是两回事情。尽管有些贪污分子可以完全是被拖下水，但他既然贪污，他的行为就仍然是可耻的，不能令人同情的。而且，即使是小贪污分子，在他未彻底改过自新以前，在他仍然为资产阶级思想所俘掳的时候，如果为这样的贪污分子卸罪，就恰恰是模糊了阶级观点。况且作者所选定的贪污分子的类型，是未经改造的小资产阶级的旧技术人员，而不是另一种类型，即过去受过革命的锻炼、入城后对资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”的进攻缺乏警惕，因而堕落蜕化的老干部。对这样两种不同类型的人物，是应采取各别的描写方法，不能混淆的。
    还有一种意见认为，这样写对当时没有坦白的贪污分子能够起些作用，即进行了“坦白从宽”的政策宣传。这说法也是不对的。“坦白从宽”是指处理的方针，我们可以表现贪污分子由于自动坦白而得到宽大处理，但不能因而就否定他的行为的罪恶与可耻，更不能在作品中放松了对贪污分子的严肃的批评。不这样，作品就不能产生大的教育作用。
    在描写反贪污斗争的戏中，没有宣传“一切贪污行为都是犯法的”（薄一波）这一思想，没有严正地批判贪污行为的罪恶与可耻，相反地，却过分强调了贪污分子犯罪的被动情形，以致使人觉得仿佛贪污分子也可以原谅，甚至值得同情。这不能不说是“控诉”这个剧本的严重缺点。而且，舒渭清因为受贿而放弃了十五万件救急包的检查，使志愿军遭受了不应有的牺牲，这是何等严重的罪行！即使并非由于受贿，而仅仅由于失职，也是必须予以严重的处分的。这样的人，怎么可以写成是一个几乎令人同情的或者可以原谅的人物呢？
    在人物创造上，除了对舒渭清的描写有错误外，其他像奸商蒋绍庭和几个正面人物也没有写好，缺乏比较深刻的刻划。
    对蒋绍庭的描写是比较表面化的，外形上的丑化多于精神和性格上的刻划。他的内心生活，他的极端腐化堕落、唯利是图、丧天害理的资产阶级思想并没有被发掘出来，他怎样以资产阶级的思想来腐蚀干部，并没有表现出来。观众仅仅看到他玩弄一些并不“高明”的手段。这样的描写虽也需要，也的确能起一些宣传教育作用，但仅仅这样是很不够的，与创造一个典型的不法资本家的形象的这一目标，还有一段距离。
    马局长是作为党和政府的政策的体现者在剧中出现的。作者对他的描写既有不足的地方，也有从表面上去作不适当的夸张的地方。作者更多地写了他在办公室里忙碌处理公务，不断发号施令的领导者的生活的一面，没有生动地表现他联系群众的一面。作者竭力想渲染马局长的英明，也就是想强调党的领导作用，却对他作了过分的夸张。观众看不出他的判断有什么充足的理由，虽然戏的情节的发展证明了他的正确，但显得是人为的安排，看不出这种发展符合现实生活的逻辑。因此，作者原想表现他的英明，却反而使人感到他的武断；原想表现他的“当机立断”，却反而像是草率从事。和作者的原意相反，好些观众把马局长看成一个具有官僚主义气味的人，是并非无因的。当然，演员的比较生硬的表演，也应负一部分责任〔注一〕。此外，作为“五反”斗争的主力的工人的形象，也没有写好。可以看出，作者对工人和工人生活是不够熟悉的。
    在结构方面，剧本的缺点是：没有处理好“三反”“五反”怎样结合起来描写的问题。有这样一种意见：剧本的缺点是由于把“三反”“五反”搅在一起写的缘故〔注二〕。问题不在这里。正因为两个运动是密切结合的，运动由机关内部推向社会是一个重要的具有很大的政治意义的发展，剧本可以而且也应该反映这一现实。但在结构上，“控诉”中的贪污分子的坦白好像仅仅是为了作者企图表现这一段剧情而写的，它并没有作为情节发展上的一个关键，和奸商的被揭发紧紧扣在一起。奸商的罪行、罪证早已从别的线索上找到，贪污分子的坦白与否，从剧情发展来看，已经不起多大作用。剧本的这一艺术上的缺点，同时也造成了它对两个运动的描写的分量上的轻重倒置。剧本的主题是反盗窃，是控诉奸商，却更多地描写了贪污分子的转变。
    创作上还有别的一些疏忽，例如：剧本中表现的领导机关“三反”的马局长，同时也领导私营工厂的“五反”。这和私营厂检查组由市节约检查委员会统一领导的规定不合。这是有关政策问题的错误。
    “控诉”在“三反”“五反”运动中演出，在多少揭露了不法资本家的猖狂进攻这点上，是起了一定的教育作用的，但它又存在着如上所说的思想上和艺术上的比较严重的缺点，对这些缺点加以分析和批评是必要的，是有益于观众和作者的。但必须指出，当时的有些批评，也犯了片面的、笼统的、简单化的毛病。例如有人提出了“是谁控诉”的问题〔注三〕，怀疑到控诉奸商和领导对奸商进行反击的不是工人阶级。批评者看到舒渭清在斗争会上第一个控诉了奸商，就认为只是贪污分子在控诉。这个批评是不对的。显然地，在会上谁先控诉，谁后控诉，并不是一个重要的问题。剧中的所有反对不法资本家的人，都是控诉者。工人阶级领导“五反”运动，对不法资本家进行严肃的斗争，这一点在剧本中是明确的。
    有的批评认为剧中表现“女干部运用温情使丈夫坦白”，成为“运动胜利的基本条件”，“不符事实”；认为“这种温情的行动，居然比领导上的教育和群众的帮助都有效力”〔注四〕。这批评也是不对的。在这次运动中，大量存在着类似这样的事实，即家属的规劝成为一个贪污分子坦白的契机。描写了家属工作最后发生了作用，不会因而便否定或降低了整个运动的力量。很明显，家属之所以能起作用，家属之所以能站在人民的立场上而不站在贪污分子立场上，以帮助运动的进行，也是由于家属受到党和群众的教育之故。作品中完全不必这样来描写：对任何一个人，不论他属于什么阶级，不论他觉悟的程度怎样，不顾具体的情况怎样，一律都要用同一种方式来进行教育。这显然是一种机械的看法。
    还有的意见认为对舒渭清的单纯技术观点没有批判〔注五〕。很明显，要在作品中表现对人物的某种错误思想的批判，不一定要采用大篇说理的方法。剧中情节本身及其发展的结果，就批判了那种错误观点。
    “控诉”剧本是在“三反”运动尚未结束，“五反”运动刚刚开始的时候写作的。那时，运动本身的规律还不够明显，写作上的确存在着许多困难，当我们评价这个剧本时，是应该把这一情况估计在内的。但也不能因为这个原因就原谅剧本的毛病。这个剧所产生的一部分的好的效果必须肯定，它的缺点也必须指出。只有这样，才能真正有助于文艺创作的发展和提高。
    〔注一〕这里指北京的演出，演出者为军委总政治部文工团。
    〔注二〕讨论会上有这样的意见，另外五月十二日光明日报“评‘控诉’”（符金）中亦有类似意见。
