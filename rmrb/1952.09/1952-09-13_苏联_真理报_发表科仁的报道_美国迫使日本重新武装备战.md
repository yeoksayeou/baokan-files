    Soviet "Pravda" Publishes Koren's Report
    United States Forces Japan to Re-arm for War
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 10th] TASS Moscow, September 9th: "Pravda" published an article by Koren, datelined Tokyo, pointing out that the United States is stubbornly forcing Japan to re-arm and prepare for war.
    Koren wrote that the recent pressure exerted by the United States on the Japanese ruling clique stems from Washington's overall policy of turning Japan into an American arsenal and a supplier of cannon fodder.
    Long before the San Francisco Conference, the American occupation authorities began to exploit Japan's war potential. Shortly after the United States launched its intervention in the Korean War two years ago, the Japanese government, on the orders of the occupation authorities stationed in Japan, decided to establish a "Police Reserve Force." This is the embryo of a regular army—not the "National Safety Force" that it now claims it will establish in the future, but an army commanded by American generals.
    At the end of last year, shortly after the San Francisco Conference, the United States demanded that the Japanese government formulate a detailed plan for further war preparations in accordance with the obligations imposed on Japan by the San Francisco Treaty.
    Koren continued, in a short period of time, Japan has established a unified military leadership structure. Japan has announced a large-scale recruitment plan for the "Police Reserve Force." The Japanese government plans to increase the strength of the "Police Reserve Force" to 110,000 men. However, it is already known that the occupation headquarters is demanding a significant increase in the number of recruits. Japanese newspapers are now mentioning another figure—180,000 men.
    Due to the expansion of the "Police Reserve Force," military schools, proving grounds, supply bases, and barracks are all being increased. Recently, Vice-Minister of the Security Agency, Masuhara Keiji, declared that the military materials of the Reserve Force have increased more than threefold.
    The Japanese Navy is also accelerating its revival. It is said that the naval personnel already number 18,000 men, and will increase to 30,000 by the end of this year. Fourteen major naval bases, sixteen auxiliary naval bases, and a naval aviation training center are being established. Japan already has 484 warships with a total displacement of over 50,000 tons. It is about to acquire eighteen escort frigates and fifty landing craft from the United States. The personnel of these warships are being trained at American naval bases in the United States under the guidance of American officers.
    Arming and equipping the Japanese army is a great business for American merchants.
    According to newspaper reports, there are now plans to build warships and airplanes on a large scale, especially jet planes. New ammunition factories and arsenals are being established, and older factories of this type are being expanded.
    The rearmament of Japan by the American imperialists has encouraged many Japanese revanchists in militarist organizations. These organizations are secretly drafting new plans for aggression.
    Koren pointed out that the re-militarization of Japan has greatly alarmed the people. According to newspaper reports, the Japanese people are generally refusing to join the "Police Reserve Force." The plan to recruit the Reserve Force to form a new army has failed. The scheduled deadline has passed long ago, and the necessary number of soldiers has not yet been recruited.
    Koren concluded by saying that all of this shows that the American imperialists, who are attempting to drag Japan into a new war gamble, are being resisted by the Japanese people.

### 苏联“真理报”发表科仁的报道  美国迫使日本重新武装备战

    苏联“真理报”发表科仁的报道
    美国迫使日本重新武装备战
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：“真理报”刊载了科仁发自东京的一篇文章，他指出美国正在固执地迫使日本重新武装和进行战争准备。
    科仁写道，美国最近对日本统治集团所施的压力，是根据华盛顿要把日本变为一个美国兵工厂和炮灰供应者的总政策出发的。
    远在旧金山会议以前，美国占领当局就开始利用日本的战争潜力。在两年前美国干涉朝鲜的战争发动之后不久，日本政府奉驻在日本的占领当局之命，决定成立“警察后备队”。这是一支正规军的胚胎——这支正规军并不是现在自称以后要成立的“国家军队”，而是一支受美国将领指挥的军队。
    在去年年底，旧金山会议刚开完不久的时候，美国要求日本政府根据旧金山条约所强加在日本身上的义务拟订出进一步准备战争的详细计划。
    科仁继续写道，在短短的时间内，日本已建立了单一的军事领导机构。日本已宣布大规模招募“警察后备队”的新计划。日本政府计划要把“警察后备队”的实力增加到十一万人。但是，大家都已知道，占领军总部要求大大地增加招募的人数。日本报纸现在提到了另一个数目——十八万人。
    由于要扩充“警察后备队”，军事学校、试验场、供应基地和营房等都在增加。最近保安厅次长增原惠吉宣称，后备队的军事物资已增加为三倍以上。
    日本海军也在加紧复活。据说，海军人员已有一万八千人，在今年年底以前将增加到三万人。十四个主要海军基地、十六个辅助海军基地和一个海军航空队训练中心，正在建立中。日本已有四百八十四艘军舰，总排水量达五万吨以上。它正要由美国获得十八艘护航快舰和五十艘登陆艇。这些军舰的人员正在美国军官的指导下在美国的日本海军基地上受训练。
    武装和装备日本军队，是美国商人的一宗大好生意。
    据报纸消息，现在已有计划，要大规模建造军舰和飞机，特别是喷气机。新的弹药制造厂和兵工厂正在建立中，旧的这类工厂则加以扩充。
    美帝国主义者的重新武装日本，鼓励了许多军国主义社团中的日本复仇主义者。这些社团正在秘密拟订新的侵略计划。
    科仁指出，日本的重新军国主义化，使人民大为惊恐。据报纸消息，日本人普遍地拒绝参加“警察后备队”。招募后备队以成立新军队的计划是失败了。预定的期限已过去了很久，而必要数目的士兵还没有募足。
    科仁在结论中说道，所有这一切显示，企图把日本拉入新的战争赌博中的美帝国主义者，正遭受到日本人民的反抗。
