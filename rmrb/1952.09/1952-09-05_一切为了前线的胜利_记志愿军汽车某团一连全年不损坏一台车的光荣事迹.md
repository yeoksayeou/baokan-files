    Everything for the Victory at the Front
    ——A Record of the Glorious Feat of a Company of a Volunteer Army Automobile Regiment in Not Damaging a Single Vehicle Throughout the Year
    You Zai
    (I)
    June 18th was the victory day for all comrades of the First Company of a certain automobile regiment of our Volunteer Army in fighting enemy aircraft, safely completing the task of supplying the front lines, and not damaging a single vehicle for a whole year.
    The leaders of the automobile regiment called early in the morning to congratulate the comrades on their victory.
    On this day, the drivers couldn't sleep. They recalled every night of the past year, how they fought against the crazy enemy planes, the rugged roads, and their own fatigue to ensure the victory of the front lines; they thought that the glorious day of victory had finally arrived, and they couldn't help but laugh with joy. They walked all over the mountains and fields to find flowers to decorate their glorious vehicles. How they loved their vehicles, they also wore the "Resist America, Aid Korea" commemorative medals issued by the people of the motherland on the wooden strip in the middle of the windshield.
    On this day, everyone felt that time passed particularly slowly. It was not easy to wait until dark to start the mission. In the gully of the company headquarters, the company commander, the instructor, and all the comrades of the company headquarters had already stood in a row, as if welcoming a happy day, wearing brand-new and tidy green military uniforms, applauding and cheering for each vehicle driving out: "Comrades! Today is the last day of our year without damaging a single vehicle, give the American aerial bandits another heavy slap in the face!" The drivers stretched their heads out of the cab, waved to the people, and firmly said: "Comrades, don't worry, we guarantee to bring back glory and victory!"
    That night, the company commander held the telephone, conveying the news of victory at any time. Vehicles returned one by one, and the gully of the company headquarters immediately became lively again. Everyone was congratulating on the victory, pairs of strong hands were clasped together; the heroes laughed heartily. The company commander shouted happily: "Miracle! This is really a miracle!"
    (II)
    Yes. This is truly a miracle.
    The North Korean roads carved along the mountains are winding, tortuous, and difficult to navigate. Under the frenzied activities of enemy planes, drivers could not always turn on their lights when driving at night. The vehicles traveled between cliffs and precipices, and a little carelessness could lead to the danger of rolling off the cliff or falling into the deep ravine. Every year, the turn of summer and autumn is the rainy season in Korea, and floods often wash away roads and bridges; in winter, ice and snow freeze the wilderness, the roads are slippery, which increases the difficulty of driving. At the same time, the enemy planes, rampant for a while, bombed and strafed our transportation lines day and night, dropping all kinds of timed bombs on the roads, setting up so-called "air blockades" in key transportation areas, and also dropping four-cornered nails and four-cornered iron specifically to damage car tires... Our heroic automobile troops, under such difficult conditions, broke through thousands of difficulties and dangers, and transported grain and ammunition to the front lines in a continuous stream.
    Under such difficult transportation conditions, completing a large number of military transport tasks, and being able to not damage a single vehicle for a year, who can say that this is not a miracle? In order to better ensure the victory of the front lines and cherish the property of the people of the motherland, the comrades of the First Company launched this miracle-creating campaign from June 19th of last year.
    At the beginning of the campaign, the company established a research group on fighting the enemy and a camouflage group. The research group on fighting the enemy was personally led by the company commander and the instructor, absorbing drivers with rich experience in fighting enemy aircraft to participate, studying the laws of enemy aircraft activities and formulating countermeasures. The company commander and instructor personally checked the camouflage of the vehicles every day, and the company strictly controlled the departure time and driving discipline.
    After the campaign started, the drivers took extra care of their own and others' vehicles. They knew that the vehicles were weapons given to them by the people of the motherland to resist America and aid Korea, and if they damaged the vehicles, how could they guarantee the victory of the front lines? They also knew that every vehicle was the property of the people of the motherland and must be cherished; every vehicle lost affected the victory of the front lines and damaged the glory of the whole company. They strictly abided by the driving discipline stipulated by the company, paid attention to the maintenance of the vehicles at all times, and also came up with many ways to fight enemy aircraft to prevent vehicle damage. They nailed a piece of wood flat on the top of the windshield, so that when rushing through the enemy's flare blockade, the target would not be exposed due to the reflection of the windshield glass. They were especially careful when camouflaging. According to the instructions of the company, they hid the vehicles before dawn; after dawn, they had to look around and sometimes climb to the high ground to see, until they felt that the camouflaged place was the same as without a car, they could rest at ease. Once the plane circled overhead, they were always afraid that their car was not well camouflaged, and they quickly ran to the car to guard it. If the enemy plane dropped a bomb, they would rescue the vehicle at any time. After the enemy plane buzzed around twice and left, a peaceful smile appeared on their faces again. Sometimes, the enemy planes circled overhead several times a day, which naturally affected the rest of the drivers and assistants; but they didn't mind and said: "As long as the capital for resisting America and aiding Korea (referring to the vehicles) is not written off, as long as the glory of the whole company is not lost in our hands, it doesn't matter if we are a little tired."
    During the so-called "Autumn Offensive" launched by the American aggressors in August and September of last year, the activities of enemy planes were even more frenzied than usual; and five "air blockade nets" were set up on the roads near the front lines. In the areas blockaded by enemy planes, the flares illuminated the sky like snow, and the planes shuttled back and forth on the roads bombing and strafing, the longest blockade sometimes lasting two or three hours. Our well-trained automobile troops, in order to ensure the victory of the front lines, bravely and resourcefully fought against enemy aircraft.
    In a grain-grabbing mission, the instructor was driving a convoy on the highway when suddenly two beams of light like electric poles shot out from the sky, sweeping sharply back and forth on the highway. It turned out that the enemy had turned on the searchlights on the wings. The enemy planes then dived down, and the houses in front and behind were set on fire. The instructor shouted loudly: "Comrades! Can we let the brothers at the front line go hungry to annihilate the enemy?" Everyone answered firmly: "No!" The instructor immediately issued an order: "Distance apart! Charge!" All the vehicles flew up like taking off... They safely transported all the grain to the front lines.
    Also on one night during the battle to smash the enemy's "Autumn Offensive," Communist Party member Liu Fengqi led six vehicles loaded with ammunition to the front line. After turning a bend, he saw a large string of cars parked in front of him, darkly. He drove closer and asked, only to learn that enemy planes had dropped several timed bombs on the road ahead. Some had already exploded, and a large one had blown a large gap in the road, and the flying sand and stones filled the drainage ditches on the side of the road. Liu Fengqi frowned, looking at the six ammunition trucks he was leading, and then at the vehicles beside him, he thought: "So much ammunition, so much supplies, transported to the front line, can eliminate how many American devils!" At this time, he suddenly remembered the experience of removing timed bombs introduced by the company's research group on fighting the enemy, and he walked forward with full confidence. He found that there were still three unexploded timed bombs on the road, and he wanted to remove the timed bombs immediately; however, he remembered the law of enemy aircraft activities: in the area where enemy planes had dropped timed bombs, enemy planes would come to bomb frantically before long. He thought: "It will take a lot of time to move the three timed bombs 200 meters away from the road. If the enemy planes suddenly arrive, what a big loss it will cause!" He also thought: "Our company's departure time is later than usual, and there won't be many cars coming behind." So, he decided to drive the car away from the danger zone first. Turning around, he stepped on the loose soil in the ditch, and it didn't sink his feet. He immediately ran back and said: "Charge past first!" He led his six cars in front, one after another, and they all drove past. A burst of jubilation immediately rose on the road, and all the vehicles started. When their cars drove not far away, they heard the roar of the enemy planes attacking. Liu Fengqi was full of contempt for the enemy and said: "Hum! See what you bomb!"…………
    Truckload after truckload of grain and ammunition were transported to the front, and truckload after truckload of American prisoners were escorted back. Victory inspired the heroic automobile soldiers, and they sang happily with their throats open:
    We are heroic automobile soldiers,
    Speeding on the steel transportation line;
    Resist America, aid Korea, defend our country,
    Our will is as strong as steel.
    Not afraid of enemy planes going wild,
    Not afraid of mountains and rivers blocking the road,
    We break through thousands of difficulties and dangers,
    And continuously transport grain and ammunition to the front.
    Forward! Forward! Forward!
    Towards victory! Towards peace! Towards the happy tomorrow of mankind!
    (III)
    At the logistics and transportation conference of the Volunteer Army, amidst the enthusiastic cheers and applause of the people, the commander of the logistics department personally awarded a bright banner to the commander of a certain automobile regiment who commanded this glorious company. The banner highlighted the four big characters: "Resourceful and Flexible." The sunlight shone in from the window, illuminating the banner with sparkling light.
    The regimental commander brought back the banner issued by the logistics commander. The regiment immediately held a celebration meeting. This banner was placed next to the huge statue of Chairman Mao on the rostrum, which was particularly glorious. People looked at the statue of Chairman Mao, looked at the banner, and then looked at the heroes of the First Company. Everyone smiled from the bottom of their hearts. The bright red flowers reflected the smiling faces of every hero. When the regimental commander presented this banner to the instructor of the First Company on behalf of the logistics commander, cheers, embraces, and enthusiastic applause shook the house. The regimental commander said: "This glorious banner marks the brilliant victory of our automobile troops and the complete bankruptcy of the 'air superiority' boasted by the American aerial bandits! (Applause lasted for a long time) Comrades! We must consolidate glory, carry forward glory, and strive to better ensure the victory of the front lines!"
    The heroes shouted their determination in a thunderous voice: "Resolutely guarantee the supply of the front lines and strive for greater victory!"

    一切为了前线的胜利
    ——记志愿军汽车某团一连全年不损坏一台车的光荣事迹
    尤在
    （一）
    六月十八日这一天，是我志愿军汽车某团一连全体同志们对敌机进行斗争、安全完成供应前线的任务、一整年没损坏一台车的胜利日。
    汽车团首长一早就来电话，预祝同志们的胜利。
    这一天，司机同志们怎么也睡不着。他们回想到这一年来的每一个夜里，为了保证前线的胜利，他们是怎样地与疯狂的敌机、崎岖的道路和自己的疲劳作斗争的；他们想着这光荣的胜利的一天终于来到，都情不自禁地欢笑了。他们走遍山野去寻找鲜花，来打扮自己的光荣车。他们是多么热爱自己的车辆呵，他们把祖国人民颁发的抗美援朝纪念章也戴在车前风挡玻璃中间的木条上。
    这一天，大家感觉时间过得特别慢，好容易等到天黑，开始出车了。在连部的山沟里，连长、指导员和连部的全体同志早已站成一列，像迎接大喜的日子一样，穿着崭新的整齐的绿色军装，向每台开出来的车鼓掌欢呼：“同志们！今天是咱们这一年不损坏一台车的最后一天啦，再狠狠地给美国空中强盗一个沉重的耳光吧！”司机们从驾驶台伸出头来，向人们挥动着手，坚决地说：“同志们放心吧，咱们保证把光荣和胜利带回来！”
    这天晚上，连长把着电话机，随时传达着胜利的消息。车辆一台一台地回来了，连部的山沟里立刻又活跃起来。大家在祝贺着胜利，一双双粗壮的手握在一起；英雄们尽情欢笑。连长高兴得连连喊道：“奇迹！这真是奇迹！”
    （二）
    是的。这真是奇迹。
    沿山开凿的北朝鲜公路是迂回曲折崎岖难行的。在敌机的疯狂活动下，司机们夜间行车还不能经常开灯。车行在悬崖峭壁间，稍一不慎，就会有滚下悬崖或者跌入深涧的危险。每年夏秋之交是朝鲜的雨季，洪水经常冲毁道路和桥梁；冬天，冰雪封冻着原野，道路溜滑，更增加行车的困难。同时逞狂一时的敌机，昼夜不停地狂轰滥炸我们的运输线，在公路上丢下了各式各样的定时性炸弹，在交通要道地区布置了所谓“空中封锁”，还投下了专门破坏汽车轮胎的四角钉、四角铁……我们英雄的汽车部队，就是在这样艰难的条件下，突破千重困难万重险，把粮食弹药源源不断地运到前线去的。
    在这样艰难的运输条件下，完成了大量的军运任务，而又能一年不损坏一台车，谁能说这不是奇迹呢？一连的同志们为了更好地保证前线的胜利，爱护祖国人民的财产，从去年六月十九日那天起，就展开了这个创造奇迹的运动。
    运动开始时，连里就成立了对敌斗争研究组和伪装组。对敌斗争研究组由连长、指导员亲自领导，吸收有丰富的对敌机斗争经验的司机们参加，研究敌机活动的规律并定出对策。连长、指导员每天亲自检查车辆伪装的情况，连部严格地掌握了出车时间与行车纪律。
    运动开始后，司机们对于自己的和别人的车辆都格外爱护了。他们知道：车辆就是祖国人民交给他们抗美援朝的武器，如果把车搞坏了，怎么能保证前线的胜利呢？他们也知道：每一台车，都是祖国人民的财产，都要爱护；每一台车的损失，都影响前方的胜利，而且损害全连的光荣。他们严格地遵守了连部规定的行车纪律，随时注意车辆的保养，并且还想出许多对敌机斗争的办法不使车辆损坏。他们在风挡的上面平钉上一块木板，这样在冲过敌人的照明弹封锁区时，就不会因为风挡玻璃的反光而暴露目标。特别是在伪装的时候更留神了。大家根据连部的指示，天没亮之前就把车隐蔽好；天亮了，还要东瞧瞧，西瞧瞧，有时还要爬到高地去看看，直等到自己都觉得伪装的地方和没有车子一样，才稍为安心地去休息。一旦飞机在头顶上盘旋起来，他们总怕是自己的车没伪装好，便赶紧跑到车旁去守护着。如果敌机投弹的话，就随时抢救车辆。敌机瞎嗡两圈后走了，于是他们的脸上才又露出安详的微笑。有时，敌机一天在头顶上盘旋好几次，自然就影响司机和助手的休息；但是他们毫不介意地说：“只要抗美援朝的本钱（指车子）不报销，只要全连的光荣不在我们手里断送，我们累点没啥。”
    美国侵略者在去年八、九月间发动所谓“秋季攻势”，敌机的活动比平时更为疯狂了；并且在临近前线的公路上，布置了五道“空中封锁网”。在敌机封锁的地区内，照明弹照得满天雪亮，飞机像穿梭一样地在公路上来回轰炸扫射，封锁最长的时间有时竟达两三小时。我们久经锻炼的汽车部队，为了保证前线的胜利，英勇机智地与敌机进行斗争。
    在一次抢运粮食的任务中，指导员带着一个车队正行驶在公路线上，突然，从天空射出两支像电柱一样的灯光，在公路上急剧地扫来扫去。原来是敌人把机翼上的探照灯打开了。敌机紧接着便俯冲下来，前后的房子都被打着了火。指导员高声喊道：“同志们！我们能不能让前线的兄弟部队饿着肚子去歼灭敌人？”大家斩钉截铁地回答：“不能！”指导员立刻发出口令：“距离拉开！冲！”所有的车子都像腾空一般地飞起来了……他们把全部粮食安全地运到了前线。
    也是在粉碎敌人的“秋季攻势”战役中的一天晚上，共产党员刘凤岐，带着满载炮弹的六辆车驰向前线。转过一个弯道，就看见前面黑黝黝地停着一大串车。他们驶近一打听，才知道是敌机在前面公路上丢下了几颗定时弹。有的已经爆炸了，一颗大的把公路炸断了一道大缺口，横飞的沙石把道旁的排水沟都填满了。刘凤岐皱着眉头，望望他所带的六辆炮弹车，又望望旁的车辆，他想：“这么多的弹药，这么多的物资，运上前线去，可以消灭多少美国鬼子呵！”这时，他突然记起连里对敌斗争研究组曾经介绍过的排除定时弹的经验，便满怀信心地向前走去。他发现路上还有三颗未爆炸的定时弹，他本想立刻动手排除定时弹；然而他想起敌机活动的规律：在敌机投过定时弹的地区，隔不多久，敌机就会来疯狂轰炸的。他想：“把三个定时弹搬离公路二百米以外，需要不少的时间。如果敌机突然来到，将会造成多大的损失呵！”他又想：“咱们连出车的时间比一般的都晚，后面不会有很多的车来了。”于是，他决定先把车开离危险区。转过身来，他用脚踩踩道沟里的乱土，并不陷脚，他便立刻跑回来说：“先冲过去！”他便带着他的六辆车开在前面，一辆接着一辆都开过去了。公路上立刻扬起了一片欢腾，所有的车辆都开动了。当他们的车开走不远，果然就听见来袭的敌机吼叫声。刘凤岐充满了对敌人的鄙视说：“哼！看你炸什么！”…………
    粮食弹药一车车地运上前方，美国俘虏一车车地押回来，胜利鼓舞着英雄的汽车兵，他们放开喉咙愉快地唱着：
    我们是英雄的汽车兵，
    飞驰在钢铁的运输线上；
    抗美援朝、保家卫国，
    我们意志坚如钢。
    不怕敌机逞狂，
    不怕山河把路挡，
    我们突破千重困难万重险，
    把粮食弹药源源不断运上前方。
    向前！向前！向前！
    向胜利！向和平！向人类幸福的明天！
    （三）
    志愿军后勤运输会议上，在人们热烈的欢呼与掌声中，后勤司令员亲自把一面鲜艳的锦旗授与指挥这个光荣连队的汽车某团团长。锦旗上突出四个大字：“机智灵活”。阳光从窗户射进来，照耀着锦旗闪闪发光。
    团长把后勤司令员发给的这面锦旗带了回来。团里立刻召开了庆功大会。这面锦旗被布置在主席台上毛主席巨像的旁边，显得特别光彩。人们看看毛主席像，看看锦旗，再看看一连的英雄们，大家都由衷地笑了。鲜艳的大红花映红了每个英雄的笑脸。当团长代表后勤司令员把这面锦旗颁发给一连指导员的时候，欢呼呵，拥抱呵，狂热的掌声震动着屋宇。团长说：“这面光荣的锦旗标志着我们汽车部队的辉煌胜利，标志着美国空中强盗所吹嘘的‘空中优势’的彻底破产！（掌声经久不停）同志们！我们要巩固光荣，发扬光荣，为更好地保证前线的胜利而奋斗！”
    英雄们用雷一般的声音，响亮地喊出自己的决心：“坚决保证前线的供应，为争取更大的胜利而奋斗！”
