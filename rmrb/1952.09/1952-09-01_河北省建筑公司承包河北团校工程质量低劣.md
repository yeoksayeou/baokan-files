    Hebei Construction Company's Inferior Quality in Contracting Hebei Communist Youth League School Project
    Editor: The leading cadres of Hebei Construction Company have serious bureaucratic work styles in contracting the Hebei Communist Youth League School building project, causing great losses to state property.
    Through our preliminary inspection, we discovered many serious problems in the construction project. For example, out of 233 rooms, 126 rooms have roof trusses that do not meet specifications. According to regulations, both purlins must be placed on the ridgepole, but they only placed one end of the purlin on the ridgepole, and the other end of the purlin was connected to another purlin with a 4 cm tongue-and-groove joint. At the same time, the purlin is only 1 cm thick, with low load-bearing capacity, and the situation is very serious, with the risk of collapse in the newly built project.
    For another example, out of 233 rooms, all except the 17 toilets have bulging walls ranging from 1 to 2 cm. Among them, 33 rooms have wall bulges of up to 3 to 4 cm, also with the risk of collapse. In addition, there are problems such as unstable foundations and substandard materials of low quality.
    The leading cadres of the construction company were aware of these problems early on, but did not seriously address them.
    We hope that the leading cadres of Hebei Construction Company will quickly correct the above deviations and make a profound self-criticism.

### 河北省建筑公司承包河北团校工程质量低劣

    河北省建筑公司承包河北团校工程质量低劣
    编辑同志：河北省建筑公司的领导干部，在承包河北团校校舍工程中存在着严重的官僚主义作风，给国家资财造成很大损失。
    经我们初步检查，发现了在工程建设中有很多严重问题。例如，在二百三十三间房舍中，有一百二十六间人字架不合规格。按规定两檩都必须放在柁上，但他们仅把一头的檩放在柁上，另一头的檩则用四公分的舌嘴咬在另一檩上，同时，檩只有一公分粗，负荷力小，情况非常严重，新建工程有坍塌的危险。
    又如，在二百三十三间房舍中，除十七间厕所没有墙臌外，其余全部墙臌有一至二公分。其中有三十三间墙臌达三、四公分之多，也有坍塌的危险。另外还有地基不坚固，材料质量过低、不合规格等问题。
    这些问题，建筑公司领导干部早有所知，但没有认真加以解决。
    我们希望河北省建筑公司的领导干部，迅速纠正上述偏差，并作深刻的检讨。
