    On the Party Membership of Party Members with a Rich Peasant Background in Rural Areas
    Question: How should the party membership of party members with a rich peasant background in rural areas be handled?
    Answer: The land reform work to eliminate the feudal exploitation system is about to be fully completed throughout the country. After the land reform, the enthusiasm of farmers for production has been greatly improved. The party's agricultural policy in rural areas is basically to "organize" and carry out the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement. The party organizations in rural areas and every Communist Party member must actively publicize and implement the party's policy with practical and effective actions, that is, with exemplary leadership. Therefore, party members who are of rich peasant origin and have become an obstacle to or sabotage the labor mutual aid production cooperation movement must be dealt with seriously in order to implement the party's policy and maintain the party's purity.
    When dealing with the party membership of party members with a rich peasant background in rural areas (whether old or new rich peasants), it should first be stated that the current policy of the party and the people's government is to allow the existence and development of the rich peasant economy in society; however, Communist Party members must never exploit others (whether it is feudal or capitalist exploitation). Party members cannot be rich peasants, capitalists, landlords or usurers. In the future, the direction of rural development is to gradually move towards agricultural collectivization, so to be a Communist Party member, one must eliminate any means of production that exploits others and actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. If he accepts the party's opinion, and he has not lost the qualifications of a party member in other aspects, then his party membership should be retained, and the party should not regard him as a rich peasant. If he is unwilling to give up his exploitative behavior and continues to engage in rich peasant or other forms of exploitation, his party membership should be unconditionally revoked.
    For party members from rich peasant families who do not directly participate in exploitative behavior, as long as they can adhere to the party's position and draw a clear line between themselves and their exploiting families, their party membership should not be affected by their family background.

    关于农村中富农成分的党员的党籍问题
    问：农村中富农成分的党员的党籍问题应如何处理？
    答：消灭封建剥削制度的土地改革工作，即将在全国范围内全部完成。土地改革后，农民的生产积极性大大提高。党在农村的农业政策，基本上是“组织起来”开展农业生产互助合作运动。农村中党的组织和每一个共产党员，必须积极地宣传并以实际有效的行动，即以模范带头作用来实现党的这种政策。因此，对于已成为阻碍或破坏劳动互助生产合作运动的富农成分的党员，必须加以严肃地处理，以贯彻党的政策，保持党的纯洁。
    在处理农村中富农成分（不论是旧富农或新式富农）的党员的党籍问题时，首先应说明：目前党和人民政府的政策，是允许社会上富农经济的存在和发展的；但共产党员决不能剥削他人（不论是封建剥削或资本主义剥削），党员不能去作富农，也不能作资本家、地主或高利贷者。今后农村发展生产的方向是逐步走向农业集体化，所以要作一个共产党员就必须取消任何剥削他人的生产方式，积极地参加互助合作运动。如果他接受党的这种意见，而且他在其他方面也没有丧失党员条件，那自应保留其党籍，党也不应当以富农来看待他。如果他不愿意放弃他的剥削行为，继续进行富农的或其他方式的剥削，则应无条件地开除其党籍。
    对于富农家庭出身、自己不直接参与剥削行为的党员，只要他能坚持党的立场，划清他和剥削者家庭的界限，则其本人的党籍不应受家庭成分的影响。
