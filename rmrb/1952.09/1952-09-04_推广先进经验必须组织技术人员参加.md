    Promoting Advanced Experiences Must Involve Technical Personnel
    Li Ganzhong, Director of the Harbin Engineering Office of the Construction Engineering Company, Northeast Industrial Department
    To promote advanced experiences, it is essential to mobilize technical personnel to participate. Initially, the leaders of our Harbin Engineering Office did not have a clear understanding of this issue. At the time, we only made general mobilizations and appeals, without deeply understanding the thoughts of the technical personnel or criticizing their various erroneous views. Therefore, although the workers were very enthusiastic about promoting advanced experiences after the start of work, the inconsistent ideological understanding of the technical personnel and the conservative thinking of some of the older technical personnel affected the workers' morale, causing our office to take a detour in promoting advanced experiences after the start of work.
    Technical personnel have three incorrect attitudes towards promoting advanced experiences: one is open resistance. For example, construction worker Liang Xikai said when he saw workers squeezing mortar with both hands, "One hand can't even do it well, yet you're using two hands, just do your job honestly!" One technical person in charge of a construction site said, "I get a headache as soon as I hear about advanced experiences." Even more serious, there were individual construction workers who were directing workers on the site with trowels, saying, "The trowel is still the best!" The second is passive resistance. During the Red Flag Competition, some construction workers secretly suppressed the groups promoting squeezing mortar with both hands when evaluating the Red Flags; some construction workers emphasized that squeezing mortar with both hands must have a mortar spreader, otherwise it would be impossible to squeeze (the mortar spreader had not yet been made at the time, but in fact it could be squeezed without a mortar spreader); some emphasized many other difficulties, such as the width of the wall, the unsightly appearance of clear water walls, etc. The third attitude is indifference to the work of promoting advanced experiences, neither caring nor asking. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent among technical personnel in charge of construction sites. Some construction site directors (technical personnel) believe that promoting advanced experiences is the business of the trade union and has nothing to do with themselves; some construction site directors (technical personnel) do not study advanced experiences at all, and few engineers solve the technical problems in the promotion. Sometimes when they are approached, they simply push it away, so that the difficulties encountered by the workers in operation are not resolved for a long time.
    Because we did not quickly reverse the erroneous understanding of the technical personnel and organize them to actively participate in the work of promoting advanced experiences, the work of promoting advanced experiences was greatly hindered. For example, when the Eighth Construction Site started work at the end of May, the workers were very enthusiastic about using advanced experiences to work, but the technical personnel in charge of the leadership work did not prepare tools and allocate work sections according to advanced operating methods. After the workers raised their opinions, the construction site director adopted an attitude of indifference. As a result, the workers had to use shovels to spread the mortar, and the construction worker also said that the quality was not good, so that the work of promoting advanced experiences at the construction site had not been carried out for a long time. In addition, in some construction sites, although the workers used the method of squeezing mortar with both hands, they were openly or secretly opposed by some construction personnel, and finally abandoned the advanced operating method and went back to the old ways.
    Among the technical personnel, most of them directly direct the workers to construct, if they adopt a passive resistance attitude towards advanced experiences, how can they lead the workers to promote advanced experiences? Therefore, timely solving the erroneous ideas of the technical personnel and vigorously organizing and mobilizing the technical personnel to participate in this movement is one of the key issues in promoting advanced experiences.
    How to solve the ideological problems of the technical personnel? According to our initial experience, the first is to correct the understanding of the technical personnel. We held small-scale symposiums for technical personnel, specialized meetings on promoting advanced experiences, and debates on how to treat the promotion of advanced experiences. At the meeting, many technical personnel examined their ideological errors, which were due to treating workers with old management methods, sticking to conventions, always thinking that the old ways were good, and fearing that workers would create new things and their own set would not work. An old technician said in his examination that in the past he thought that he had been teaching workers for more than 20 years, and now he had to turn around and learn from the workers, what was this! Therefore, in the past, his own thoughts could not be cleared. Some people also examined that they did not believe in any advanced experiences before, thinking that it was just talk. After discussion, the technical personnel unanimously believed that the reason for these errors was that they had deeply rooted conservative ideas, only saw their own set, and could not see new things. In addition, it was because the technical personnel usually did not combine enough with the workers, did not go deep into the workers, and did not adequately estimate the wisdom of the working class. Secondly, it is necessary to educate technical personnel with vivid facts. In some construction sites where advanced experiences have been promoted, work efficiency has been greatly improved, and the quality of the project has been improved. Some bricklayers used two-handed mortar squeezing, increasing from 700 to 800 bricks per person per day to more than 2,000 bricks, and the brick walls reached horizontal and vertical alignment and full mortar. The construction sites that did not promote advanced experiences had very low work efficiency, poor quality, and low morale among the workers. These two types of construction sites were a stark contrast. Using these facts to educate technical personnel is the most effective education, and it has changed the views of many technical personnel.
    Third, absorb technical personnel to participate in the work of promoting advanced experiences. Every time you discuss the promotion of advanced experiences, you must mobilize technical personnel to ask questions and let them solve the problems in the promotion of advanced experiences themselves. This can further criticize the various erroneous ideas of technical personnel, so that many technical personnel have cleared their minds and started to take action. For example, after the technical personnel of the Third Construction Site cleared their minds, they all went deep into the workers to help solve the technical problems in the promotion, so that 100% of the bricklayers in the entire construction site promoted the two-handed mortar squeezing method, and created a parallel flow operation method. In addition, in conjunction with the production instruction map, the construction was carried out in a planned and rhythmic manner, greatly shortening the construction period. Another example is Wu Haofu, the director of the Seventh Construction Site, who often worked with the workers to study and solve some problems in promoting advanced experiences, so that all the bricklayers adopted advanced experiences, and the concrete workers also became a model group in the entire office with his help. Xi Xinqi, another construction site director, actively mobilized the workers to promote advanced experiences, personally explained the technical operations to the workers, and closely cooperated with the party, trade union, and Communist Youth League cadres to clear the workers' minds, so that 95 new bricklayers promoted the two-handed mortar squeezing method in a very short time. Zhou Yongmao, a construction technician, saw that the workers were struggling to carry bricks upstairs, and they were not catching up, which affected the bricklaying. He started his brain and created a trolley for hoisting bricks with a winch. Chen Zhiren, the director of the Eighth Construction Site, also learned from the Soviet Union's stereotyped box panels, shortening the construction period of the box panels and increasing the utilization rate of the box panels. Originally, a piece of wood panel would be damaged after being nailed several times, but now the stereotyped box panel can be used more than 20 times, saving a lot of wood. On the other hand, due to the lack of technical personnel at the construction site, there are now only three people (one construction site director and two construction workers) to complete eight large buildings with a total area of 20,000 square meters, which is really too much work, but he created a zoning cycle operation method to solve this problem. First, use the cycle operation in one building, with close cooperation between various types of work. After the construction workers and workers are familiar with the operating methods and the connection between the types of work, they will transfer to another work area. In this way, with very few technical personnel, they can undertake the entire on-site construction task. Now eight large buildings have been built.

    推广先进经验必须组织技术人员参加
    东北工业部建设工程公司哈尔滨工程处处长  李干忠
    推广先进经验，必须发动技术人员参加。对于这个问题，我们哈尔滨工程处的领导同志起初的认识是不明确的。当时我们只做了一般的动员号召，没有深入地了解技术人员的思想，批判他们各种错误的看法。因此，开工后工人对推广先进经验情绪虽然很高，但由于技术人员思想认识的不一致，及部分较老的技术人员存在着保守思想，因而影响了工人的情绪，使我处开工后推广先进经验的工作走了弯路。
    技术人员对推广先进经验有三种不正确的态度：一种是公开抵抗。如施工员梁喜凯看到工人双手挤浆时说：“一只手都干不好，还用两只手，你老实点干吧！”有一个工地负责的技术员说：“我一听先进经验脑袋就痛”。更严重的还有个别施工员拿着瓦刀在现场指挥工人施工，并说：“还是瓦刀好呀！”第二种是消极抵抗。在红旗竞赛运动中评红旗时，个别施工员暗里打击推广双手挤浆的小组；有的施工员强调推广双手挤浆必须有铺灰器，否则无法挤浆（当时铺灰器尚未做成，实际没有铺灰器亦可挤浆）；有的强调其他许许多多的困难，如墙宽、清水墙不美观等。第三种态度，是对推广先进经验工作漠不关心，不管不问。特别是工地负责的技术人员，更是普遍地存在着这种现象。有些工地主任（技术人员）认为推广先进经验是工会的事，与自己无关；有些工地主任（技术人员）对先进经验根本不加研究，也很少有工程师去解决推广中的技术问题。有时找到他们，也是一推了之，使工人在操作上遇到的困难问题，很久不得解决。
    由于我们没有很快扭转技术人员的错误认识，并组织他们积极参加推广先进经验的工作，因而推广先进经验的工作受到很大阻碍。如第八工地于五月底开工时，工人抱着很高热情要运用先进经验来干活，但负领导工作的技术人员没有按先进操作法准备工具及分配工段，工人们提出意见后，工地主任采取置之不理的态度。结果工人只好用铁锹铺灰，而施工员还说质量不好，以致该工地推广先进经验工作很久没有开展起来。此外，还有些工地，工人虽然使用双手挤浆法，但遭到部分施工人员明的或暗的反对，终于放弃了先进操作法，干起老一套来了。
    在技术人员中，大部分人直接指挥工人施工，如果他们对待先进经验采取消极抵抗态度，又怎样能领导工人去推广先进经验呢？因此，及时解决技术人员的错误思想，大力地组织与发动技术人员参加这一运动，是推广先进经验工作中的关键问题之一。
    怎样解决技术人员的思想问题呢？根据我们初步的体会，首先要端正技术人员的认识。我们分别召开了小型的技术人员座谈会，推广先进经验专业会，及怎样对待先进经验推广工作的辩论会。在会上许多技术人员检讨自己思想认识的错误，是由于用旧的管理方法来对待工人，墨守成规，总认为老一套好，怕工人创造了新东西，自己的一套就吃不开了。一个老技术员在检讨中说，他过去认为自己干了二十多年都是教工人干，现在要回头向工人学，这是什么话！因此过去自己的思想打不通。也有些人检讨以前不相信有什么先进经验，认为还不是说说而已。经过讨论，技术人员一致认为所以产生这些错误，是因为有着根深柢固的保守思想，只看到自己的一套，看不见新鲜事物。此外，就是由于技术人员平时和工人结合不够，没有深入到工人中去，对工人阶级智慧估计不足。其次，要用活的事实来教育技术人员。在一部分已经推广了先进经验的工地，工作效率大大提高，并且改善了工程质量。有些瓦工使用了双手挤浆，由每人每天七、八百块砖提高到两千多块砖，砖墙达到横平竖直、灰浆饱满。那些没有推广先进经验的工地，工作效率很低，质量也不好，工人情绪不高。这两类工地成了鲜明的对比。用这些事实教育技术人员，是最有效的教育，它改变了许多技术人员的看法。
    其三，吸收技术人员参加推广先进经验的工作。每一次讨论推广先进经验时，必须发动技术人员提问题，让他们自己来解决推广先进经验中的问题。这可以进一步批判技术人员各种错误思想，使许多技术人员打通了思想，开始行动起来。如第三工地技术人员，思想搞通了以后，都深入到工人中去帮助解决推广中的技术问题，使全工地瓦工百分之百的推广了双手挤浆法，并且创造了平行流水作业法。另外，并结合生产指示图，实行有计划有节奏的施工，大大缩短了工期。又如第七工地主任吴浩甫，经常和工人研究解决推广先进经验中的一些问题，使瓦工全部采用先进经验，混凝土工也在他的帮助下，成为全处的模范小组。另一个工地主任奚新岐积极发动工人推广先进经验，亲自向工人讲解技术操作，并与党、工会、青年团干部密切配合打通工人思想，使新来九十五名瓦工在很短时间内，全部推广了双手挤浆法。施工技术人员周永茂看见工人向楼上挑砖十分吃力，而且不赶趟，影响砌砖，他就开动了脑筋，创造了卷扬机吊砖的小车。第八工地主任陈志仁也学习了苏联的定型盒子板，缩短了制盒子板的工期，增长了盒子板使用率，原一块木板钉几次就坏了，现在定型盒子板可用二十多次，节省了大量的木材。另一方面，该工地由于技术人员缺乏，现只有三人（工地主任一人、施工员二人）要完成总面积二万平方米的八栋大楼，实在跑不过来，但是他创造了分区循环作业法，解决了这个问题。先在一栋楼使用循环作业，各工种紧密配合，待施工员、工人都熟习了操作方法，与工种间联系后再转到另一工区，就这样以很少技术人员担负起整个现场施工任务，现在八栋大楼已修起来。
