The trial system of the people's judicial organs should be convenient for the people, facilitate the protection of the people's interests, and implement dictatorship over the reactionaries. It should be fundamentally different from all reactionary old trial systems. However, many people's courts have continued to use the reactionary old trial system, causing harm or great inconvenience to the people, and benefiting the enemies of the people. The continued use of the old trial system manifests in the following aspects:

	I. Case Acceptance: The first situation is "no prosecution, no hearing." Many staff members in the People's Courts, sometimes knowing that events harming the people's interests have occurred, and knowing the details of the case, are indifferent and continue to use the old system of "no prosecution, no hearing." A typical example is a staff member of the Qingjian County People's Court in Shaanxi Province who witnessed a mother-in-law instigating two younger daughters-in-law to poison her daughter-in-law, but stood by and watched without intervening. The second is non-acceptance due to "ineligible parties." In a certain city, a poor citizen's family was poisoned due to a gas pipe rupture of a foreign gas company, resulting in the death of a child. They sued the gas company in the People's Court. However, the court believed that suing only the company and not specific individuals meant the defendant was "ineligible" and "could not be accepted." Later, the citizen reported this to the local newspaper, which attracted the attention of the higher judicial organs, who then instructed the city's People's Court to handle it. The third is non-acceptance due to "inconsistent jurisdiction." Liu Qizhen of Chunhua County, Shaanxi Province, bought a widow, Yao Ye'er, for forty-six stones of wheat to be his wife. Yao Ye'er, feeling no affection for Liu Qizhen, returned to her mother's home (Gong County, Henan Province) and never returned to Liu's house. Liu Qizhen filed a lawsuit with the Chunhua County People's Court, and Yao Ye'er also filed for divorce from Liu Qizhen with the Gong County People's Court. The Chunhua County People's Court, citing "lawsuits must be filed in the defendant's location," pushed it to Gong County for handling. The Gong County People's Court then said it should be handled by Chunhua County, pushing it back to Chunhua County. The People's Courts of the two counties pushed it back and forth, exchanging official documents seven times, and after one year and forty-two days (as of June 10th this year), it still had not been resolved. The fourth is non-acceptance due to "inconsistent trial levels." In the case of Shanghai bully Bai Wenlong's seduction and abuse of the young girl Wang Kou'er, the Shanghai Municipal People's Court sentenced Bai Wenlong to three years imprisonment in the first instance. Bai Wenlong appealed to the East China Branch of the Supreme People's Court. At this time, the victim stated that an accomplice, Li Bufu, should also be brought to justice. However, the East China Branch believed that the accomplice mentioned by the victim had not been judged in the first instance, and "the second instance cannot directly accept it," so it was rejected. The fifth is non-acceptance due to "no complaint." A poor farmer from Hebei Province went to the Provincial People's Court to file a lawsuit over a land dispute. He begged along the way, traveled hundreds of miles to Baoding, and hopefully presented his problem to the Provincial People's Court. However, a staff member of the court rejected the farmer outside the court's gate on the grounds of not having a "complaint." A woman surnamed Rong in Bengbu City requested a divorce from the Municipal People's Court, but the court refused to accept it on the pretext of not having a "complaint." After the woman returned home, she was ridiculed and satirized by her husband, and committed suicide out of shame and indignation. These old systems remaining in the People's Courts have added great pain to the working people, preventing them from receiving the protection of the people's law.

	II. Case Handling: The first situation is complicated procedures and bureaucratic delays. The Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court had twenty procedures from case acceptance to case closing. After one improvement, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Court still had twenty-eight procedures. The case of the Northeastern farmer Chai You San losing his horse went through four court trials, four court official documents back and forth, lasted seven months, and went through forty procedures. Cumbersome procedures coupled with irresponsible staff have resulted in serious backlogs and delays in case handling. A case handled by the Shenyang Municipal People's Court was delayed for three years and three months. The Xinxiang Municipal People's Court in Pingyuan Province had twenty-two prisoners detained for more than two years who had not been tried. Five of them did not even have case files. In particular, many courts have long delayed processing cases of women requesting divorce, leading to some women committing suicide due to unbearable domestic abuse. The second is "civil cases are not concerned with criminal cases, and criminal cases are not concerned with civil cases," treating procedures as procedures. When handling the Song Rongxin bigamy and abandonment case, the Qingdao Municipal People's Court first sentenced Song to two months imprisonment with a criminal judgment from the criminal court, and then the civil court issued a civil judgment approving Song Rongxin's divorce from the woman Jing. Originally it was one case, but they had to have double trials and double judgments. The Nanjing Municipal People's Court sentenced a counter-revolutionary element to death and decided to confiscate his property. The main text of the judgment omitted the word "confiscation." Originally, a supplementary judgment would have been enough. However, the court's enforcement personnel wrote an official letter to the Land Bureau, asking the Land Bureau to accuse the People's Procuratorate; then the Procuratorate filed a lawsuit with the court; and the court made another judgment. They just went around in circles for "procedure" without getting tired. The third is "handling cases based on the case, and dealing with matters based on the matter." A trial judge of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Court publicly promoted the secret to handling cases as "handle what is complained about." When the Pingyao County People's Court in Shanxi Province accepted a bandit murder case, the case handler knew that the bandit had weapons hidden, but thought it was "irrelevant to himself" and did not pursue them. Many courts do not care about the issue of divorced women bringing property unless the woman makes a request, failing to protect women's legitimate rights. The fourth is "officials never regret judgments," and "a matter is not dealt with again." When a wrong case is judged, they refuse to publicly admit their mistake to the people and correct it, but insist on the error, putting "face" first. For example, the Wuhan Municipal People's Court arbitrarily ordered a primary school to vacate its premises, without considering the school's difficulties in vacating. The Municipal People's Government raised an opinion, believing that the judgment was inappropriate. However, a judicial officer of the Municipal People's Court was unwilling to change the judgment, believing it would undermine the "solemnity" of the court's judgment. Some courts, when detaining the wrong person or judging the wrong case, have to find some "reasons," add crimes to the person, or sentence them to as many days of imprisonment as they were wrongly detained, or deliberately announce "educational release" to show that the wrongly detained person is still guilty. These judicial officers want to use not admitting mistakes and insisting on errors to maintain the dignity of the court and the judgment, but the result is that the dignity of the court and the judgment is seriously damaged.

	III. Writing Judgments: Many judicial personnel in the People's Courts have inherited the reactionary ruling class's pretentious and deceptive "Six Laws Eight-legged Essay." Many judicial personnel deliberately write flowery and verbose judgments, full of hateful legal jargon, such as "litigation object," "ornate rhetoric," "seems to have the regret of incomplete trial," "indeed appropriate," etc., using stale and lengthy expressions that the people cannot understand. They don't care and even pride themselves on it. A judgment of the Northeast Branch of the Supreme People's Court was incomprehensible to the parties involved. They asked the second-instance court, and the staff of the second-instance court also couldn't understand it. Finally, they asked the Secretary-General of the Northeast Branch to read it, and he also couldn't understand it. Some judicial staff members, when writing judgments, always write "confessed without concealment" regardless of whether the criminal admits it or not; regardless of whether the facts have been investigated, they routinely write "described vividly," "attached to the file for verification." Even more, many judicial staff members deliberately write statements that insult the working people, such as "village woman's gossip," "rural ignorance," etc.; or write a consensual divorce as "ox and horse do not meet, lacking virtuous harmony." This set of reactionary "Six Laws Eight-legged Essay" cannot reflect the policies of the People's Government at all, and cannot be used to educate the masses.

The various situations listed above show that the reactionary old trial system is a rope that binds the people from beginning to end. It is a tool for the reactionary ruling class to oppress and rule the people. If the people's judicial organs continue to use this corrupt and reactionary trial system, they will inevitably become detached from the masses, turn into "bureaucratic yamen," and lose their proper function in the people's democratic dictatorship. While eliminating old legal viewpoints and old judicial styles, people's judicial organs at all levels must thoroughly break this anti-people trial system, eliminate its influence in the people's judicial organs, summarize the revolutionary creations of the people's courts in various periods, and re-establish a set of trial systems that are convenient for the people and serve the people.

    彻底肃清残存在人民法院中的反人民的旧审判制度
    陈希
    人民司法机关的审判制度，应该是便利人民，便于保护人民的利益和对反动派实行专政的。它应该和一切反动的旧审判制度有根本性质的区别。但是很多人民法院却一直沿用着反动的旧审判制度，使人民受到损害或感到很大不便，使人民的敌人占了便宜。沿用旧审判制度有以下几方面情形：
    一、受理案件方面。第一种情形，是“不告不理”。人民法院中有不少工作人员，有时明知发生了危害人民利益的事件，也知道这案件的经过详情，但却漠不关心，沿用“不告不理”的旧制度。陕西省清涧县人民法院的一个工作人员亲眼看见某家婆婆唆使两个小姑用毒药毒死媳妇，但却站在一边看热闹，不加过问，就是一个典型的例子。第二种是“当事人不适格”不受理。某城市一家贫苦市民因外商煤气公司煤气管破裂，全家中毒，小孩死亡，向人民法院控告那个煤气公司。但该法院却认为只告公司不告具体的人，被告“不适格”，“无法受理”。以后这个市民向当地报社反映，引起上级司法机关的注意，才转知该市人民法院作了处理。第三种是“管辖不合”不受理。陕西省淳化县的刘启珍用四十六石小麦买寡妇姚叶儿为妻。姚叶儿因和刘启珍没有感情，回娘家（河南巩县）后就没有再到刘家。刘启珍向淳化县人民法院起诉，姚叶儿也向巩县人民法院提出要和刘启珍离婚。淳化县人民法院以“控告须在被告所在地为之”为理由，推到巩县处理；巩县人民法院则说应由淳化县处理，又推到淳化县。两县的人民法院推来推去，公文往返七次，经过一年零四十二天（到今年六月十日止）还没有解决。第四种是“审级制度不合”不受理。上海恶霸柏文龙诱奸、虐待少女王扣儿案，经上海市人民法院第一审判处柏文龙徒刑三年。柏文龙上诉到最高人民法院华东分院。这时被害人提出还有一名帮凶犯李步福应一并法办。但华东分院认为被害人所提帮凶犯未经一审判决，“二审不能迳为受理”，竟予驳回。第五种是“无诉状”不受理。河北省一个贫苦农民为土地纠纷到省人民法院去起诉，沿途乞讨，走了几百里才到保定，满怀希望地到省人民法院提出自己的问题。而该法院某工作人员竟以没有“诉状”为理由，把这个农民拒于法院大门之外。蚌埠市一荣姓妇女到市人民法院请求离婚，该院藉口没有“诉状”，不予受理。这个妇女回家后受到丈夫的讥笑讽刺，便羞愤自杀了。这些残存在人民法院中的旧制度，给劳动人民增加了极大痛苦，使劳动人民得不到人民法律的保护。
    二、处理案件方面。第一种情形是手续繁琐，公文旅行。最高人民法院中南分院从收案到结案共有二十道手续。平原省人民法院经过一度改进之后，还有二十八道手续。东北农民柴友三失马一案，经过了四个法院审理，四个法院公文往来，前后历时七个月，经过四十道手续。手续繁琐加上工作人员不负责任，就形成对案件处理上严重的积压与拖延现象。沈阳市人民法院处理的一件案子，拖延了三年零三个月。平原省新乡市人民法院中有在押两年以上的犯人二十二名，一直未作审理。其中有五人连卷都没有。特别是对妇女要求离婚的案件，许多法院长期拖延不处理，致有的妇女因不堪家庭虐待而自杀。第二种是“民事不管刑事，刑事不管民事”为程序而程序。青岛市人民法院在处理宋镕新重婚遗弃案时，先由刑庭以刑事判决书判宋徒刑两个月，再由民庭以民事判决书判准宋镕新和妇女荆某解除婚姻关系。本来是一案，偏偏要双审双判。南京市人民法院判决某反革命分子死刑，并决定没收其房产。判决主文中漏掉“没收”字样，本来作个补充判决就行了。而法院执行人员却写公函通知地产局，要地产局向人民检察署控告；再由检察署向法院起诉；由法院再作判决。他们就是这样不厌其烦地为“程序”而兜圈子。第三种是“就案办案，就事办事”。浙江省人民法院某审判员公开宣传办案的秘诀是“告什么理什么”。山西省平遥县人民法院受理一土匪杀人案时，办案人明知这个土匪藏有武器，却认为“与己无关”，而不予追缴。不少法院对于离婚妇女带产问题，只要女方不提出要求，就不理睬，对妇女合法的权利不予保障。第四种是
    “官无悔判”，“一事不再理”。判错案件时不肯公开地向人民认错，加以纠正，而是坚持错误，“面子”第一。例如武汉市人民法院随意判令某小学校腾房，没有顾到学校腾房的困难。市人民政府提出意见，认为判得不恰当。但市人民法院某司法人员不愿改判，认为有失法院判决的“严肃性”。有的法院押错人或判错案时，也要硬找些“理由”，加人以罪，或者错押了多少日子就判多少日子的徒刑，或者故意宣布为“教育释放”，以表示被错押的人仍是有罪的。这些司法人员想用不认错和坚持错误来维护法院和判决的尊严，结果是严重地损害了法院和判决的尊严。
    三、写判决书方面，很多人民法院的司法人员承袭了反动统治阶级装腔作势、愚弄人民的“六法八股”。很多司法人员写判决书时故意舞文弄墨，满篇面目可憎的法言法语，什么“诉讼标的”、“饰辞狡展”、“似不无审理不尽之恨”、“洵属允当”等等，陈辞滥调，又臭又长，人民根本看不懂，他们也不管，甚至因此而自鸣得意。最高人民法院东北分院有一个判决书，当事人看不懂，去问二审法院，二审法院的工作人员也看不懂。最后找到东北分院秘书长看，也看不懂。有的司法工作人员写判决书时，不管犯人是否承认，每次都写上“供认不讳”；不管事实是否经过调查，照例写“指陈历历”、“附卷可稽”。更有不少司法工作人员故意写些侮辱劳动人民的语句，如“村妇饶舌”、“乡愚无知”等；或把两相情愿的离婚写成“牛马不逢，有失德合”。这一套反动的“六法八股”，丝毫不能体现人民政府的政策，不能用以教育群众。
    上面所列举的种种情况说明：反动的旧审判制度，从头到尾是一条束缚人民的绳索。它是反动统治阶级压迫人民、统治人民的工具。人民的司法机关沿用了这一套腐朽反动的审判制度，势必脱离群众，变成“官僚衙门”，而丧失它在人民民主专政中应尽的职能。各级人民司法机关在肃清旧法观点和旧司法作风的同时，必须彻底地打碎这一套反人民的审判制度，肃清它在人民司法机关中的影响，总结各时期人民法庭的革命的创造，重新建立一套便利人民、为人民服务的审判制度。
