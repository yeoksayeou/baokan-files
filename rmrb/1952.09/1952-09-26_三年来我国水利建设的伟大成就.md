    The Great Achievements of Water Conservancy Construction in Our Country in the Past Three Years
    Fu Zuoyi, Minister of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government
    (I) Introduction
    In the past three years, the Chinese people have achieved great successes in water conservancy construction.
    In these three years, through the efforts of the people of the whole country, we have changed the state of disrepair of the rivers during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, basically eliminated the serious threat of floods that the Chinese people have suffered for thousands of years, and ensured the safety of agricultural production and people's lives in most areas. In 1949, the area affected by floods nationwide was more than 100 million mu, about 60 million mu in 1950, about 21 million mu in 1951, and more than 16 million mu as of September 20, 1952. This statistic shows that the area affected by floods nationwide is rapidly decreasing year by year.
    In these three years, the Chinese people have also made great progress in the utilization of water. As of June 1952, the irrigated area in North China had doubled compared with 1949. In the Northwest region, where rainfall is scarce, the average irrigated land was only two mu for every three people in 1949, but now it has developed to one mu per person. In the past three years, the total irrigated area expanded nationwide was about 49.5 million mu. In addition, more than 184 million mu of farmland have been spared from drought due to increased and improved water supply.
    The development of water conservancy in our country in the past three years has primarily served the recovery and development of agriculture. However, since 1951, our country's water management direction has shifted from local treatment to the development of entire river basins, from passive harm elimination to active benefit promotion, and from flood defense to flood control and utilization. In particular, due to the construction of a large number of reservoirs, our utilization of water has trended towards multi-objective development. Therefore, in addition to farmland irrigation, we have also undertaken some hydropower generation and navigation improvement projects. In line with the needs of our country's industrialization, these undertakings will have greater development in the future.
    It is not an easy task to bring about such a change in a country with such a vast area, so many rivers, and such variable rainfall. In the past three years, about 20 million people have directly participated in water conservancy projects. According to incomplete statistics, the completed earthwork is more than 1.7 billion cubic meters, equivalent to excavating ten Panama Canals or twenty-three Suez Canals. In addition, there are a large number of modern construction projects.
    (II) Fundamental Treatment of Many Rivers Has Begun in the Past Three Years
    In the past three years, we have repaired most of the 42,000 kilometers of dikes across the country. We have begun to carry out fundamental treatment of entire river basins for some rivers with more serious floods, such as the Huai River, the Yi River and Shu River in East China, and the Yongding River, Daqing River, and Chaobai River in North China. For particularly large rivers such as the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, because fundamental treatment cannot be completed in a short period, temporary and effective defense measures have also been taken to eliminate the threat of abnormal floods.
    The project of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, initiated by Chairman Mao, is the first multi-objective water management plan for an entire river basin in New China. On the one hand, it aims to permanently eliminate floods for nearly 60 million people and 220,000 square kilometers of land in the Huai River basin. At the same time, it aims to use the Huai River's water flow to develop approximately 50 million mu of farmland irrigation, improve the 2,000-kilometer navigation system, and build a certain number of hydropower stations to meet the needs of agricultural and industrial power. To achieve this goal, three types of projects are being undertaken: one type is water storage projects, which involves building 13 reservoirs in the upper reaches of various tributaries of the Huai River and constructing control projects in 17 lakes and depressions along the Huai River, storing a total of 20 billion cubic meters of water, to control and regulate the Huai River's water volume, so that it will not flood during the flood season, and have sufficient water supply for irrigation, navigation, and power generation during the dry season. Another type is river channel regulation projects, including dredging old rivers, excavating new rivers, constructing dikes, and widening dike spacing. It requires that the channels of the main and tributary rivers can safely discharge the floodwater after storage and regulation, and restore the damaged drainage system in the vast area. The completion of these measures can eliminate floods and waterlogging on tens of millions of mu of farmland. Another type is water conservancy development projects, which utilize the water stored in reservoirs and lakes to carry out irrigation and hydropower generation projects, and build ship locks and regulate waterways to improve the Huai River's navigation. Among them, the Subei Irrigation Canal, which utilizes the water from Hongze Lake for irrigation, can guarantee and expand the irrigated area by 25 million mu. In the future, the Huai River, the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, and the canals of the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River will be connected, and steamship navigation can travel from Shanghai north to the Longhai Railway, east to the Yellow Sea, and west to the Beijing-Hankou Railway in Henan.
    The Huai River project started in the winter of 1950 and is now in its second year. In terms of flood control, three reservoirs and 15 lake and depression storage projects have been completed, which can control 10 billion cubic meters of floodwater. In terms of river channel regulation, a total of 2,190 kilometers of dikes on main and tributary rivers have been repaired; some of the 20-odd tributaries have been thoroughly dredged, and some have been initially dredged, completing a total of 2,880 kilometers of dredging projects. The 170-kilometer main canal and main sluices of the Subei Irrigation Main Canal have been completed. In coordination with flood storage, irrigation, dike construction, and dredging projects, a total of 138 culverts and sluices have been built. Among them, the Runheji diversion sluice on the main stream of the Huai River, the Gaoliangjian intake sluice on the Subei Irrigation Main Canal, the Yundong diversion sluice, and the control sluices on the East and West Fei Rivers are all large sluices. These projects have enabled the people in the Huai River basin to get rid of the constant threat of floods. Even in the event of the largest flood, they can ensure that the main areas will not be affected, and lay the foundation for the comprehensive development of water resources in the Huai River basin. As for the entire project, it will not be completed until 1955.
    The Yellow River is a world-renowned disaster-prone river. According to historical records of 2,500 years, it has breached its banks an average of four times every ten years. However, since most of the lower reaches of the Yellow River were liberated in 1947, it has been six years, and although there have been several major floods, they have all been safely passed under the protection of the people's strength. In the past few years, we have done more than 82 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 1.7 million cubic meters of stonework, making the 1,300-kilometer dikes in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces generally 1.5 to 2.5 meters higher than the highest water level. All the dangerous and precarious dams along the water, except for a section in Lijin, Shandong, have been replaced with solid stonework instead of temporary straw dams. In particular, in the past two years, the method of cone probing dikes created by Jin Zhao, a farmer in Pingyuan Province, has been widely promoted. A cone probing inspection has been carried out on the dikes on both sides, and 30,000 to 40,000 badger holes and rat nests have been found inside the ancient dikes and have been repaired and reinforced. The dike project has reached an unprecedented level of consolidation.
    In order to defend against abnormal floods and eliminate the disasters caused by ice jams during the thawing period in the lower reaches, the Beijindi flood detention project and the overflow weir project in Lijin County, Shandong, were also launched in 1951.
    Since there have been relatively detailed records, the largest floods in the Yellow River occurred once in 1933 and once in 1942. In terms of water volume, the floodwater in 1933 was even greater than in 1942. With the construction of the Beijindi flood detention project, it can be guaranteed that even if the Yellow River encounters the flood of 1933, it will not cause major disasters. In addition, in the section of the Yellow River from Jinan to the sea, during the spring ice melt, sometimes the upstream river has thawed but the downstream ice has not yet completely thawed, resulting in ice jams forming ice dams, blocking the water flow, and causing breaches. The overflow weir project built in Lijin County, Shandong Province, has initially solved this problem. As for the fundamental treatment project of the Yellow River, it is also being actively prepared.
    The Yangtze River is a river with fewer disasters than the Yellow River, but according to historical records, major floods occur on average once every ten years. Because the water volume is too large, the problem is not easy to solve. The Jingjiang section of Hubei Province is the most seriously threatened by floods from the Yangtze River.
    In the past three years, we have regulated the dikes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. A total of 217 million cubic meters of earthwork has been done in the entire basin. Now the dikes on the main stream can guarantee that the highest water level in previous years (the flood levels in 1931 and 1949 in different sections) will not be breached. In order to eliminate the serious floods in the Jingjiang section, the Jingjiang flood diversion project was launched in 1952. On the one hand, the 114-kilometer Jingjiang Dike on the left bank of the Yangtze River was strengthened. On the other hand, the low-lying area east of the Hudugou River, west of the Jingjiang Right Dike, and north of the Anxiang River, with a total area of 921 square kilometers, was designated as a flood diversion area. An intake sluice with a length of 1054.375 meters and a control sluice with a length of 336.6 meters were built as control mechanisms. In this way, if the Yangtze River encounters the largest flood of 1931, the flood diversion area can divert and store part of the Yangtze River's flow, reducing the Yangtze River's water level, to protect the safety of the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River.
    The Yi River and Shu River basin in East China is a historical disaster area. These rivers previously converged with the Ru River and Si River and flowed into the Huai River and into the sea. Due to the repeated incursions of the Yellow River into the Huai River channel in history, these rivers lost their smooth passage to the sea. They communicate and encroach on each other in the lower reaches. When one river floods, all rivers will experience floods. The area affected by disasters all year round is about 16 million mu. From 1949 to 1952, the people of northern Jiangsu and Shandong built a new Yi River channel with a length of more than 180 kilometers and a new Shu River channel with a length of 69 kilometers, so that the floodwaters of the two rivers have a proper passage for discharge. The drainage channels within the basin have been universally dredged and regulated to reduce waterlogging. In order to maintain the navigation of the Grand Canal, the Huaiyin Ship Lock was also renovated, and a new ship lock and control sluice were built in Zaohe Town. Now, not only has the Yi River and Shu River basin achieved two years of bumper harvests, but also the navigation of the Central Canal has been improved, and the Central Canal, which has been abandoned for a century, has resumed navigation.
    The Bai River system in North China has five major rivers that all enter the sea through the Hai River in Tianjin. The upper reaches of each river have short sources and rapid flows, and the amount of floodwater is very large, but the Hai River cannot accommodate these floods, so serious floods often occur in Hebei Province. The Chaobai River, Yongding River, and Daqing River have now begun to undergo fundamental treatment.
    The Chaobai River completed the new downstream channel in 1950, which can initially prevent major floods from causing disasters, and the reservoir in the upper reaches is being planned. The Yongding River has carried out regulation and reinforcement of dikes in the lower reaches, and soil and water conservation work has begun in the upper reaches. In addition, it is planned to build three reservoirs, the largest of which, the Guanting Reservoir, has already started construction and will be basically completed before the flood season in 1953. After the completion of this reservoir, it can basically eliminate the floods of the Yongding River, and there will be a certain amount of benefits from hydropower generation, urban industrial water use, and farmland irrigation. The Daqing River has opened a flood diversion channel in the lower reaches, and part of the sluice gate project was completed in 1951, and it can be fully completed in 1953. The reservoir in the upper reaches is also undergoing foundation drilling and other preparatory work.
    In addition, the Pearl River in Guangdong and the Han River in Hubei have undergone large-scale dike repairs in the past three years. In the coastal areas of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai in East China, there are sea dikes with a total length of 576.43 kilometers, protecting more than 14 million mu of farmland along the coast. These sea dikes were in disrepair for many years during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. After two years of consolidation and strengthening by the People's Government and the practical test of the huge typhoon in July this year, they can guarantee that the highest tide level in 1949 will not be breached under the conditions of typhoons of level 8 to level 10.
    (III) The Combination of Powerful Defense Projects and Powerful Flood Control Organizations Makes the Flood Area Gradually Shrink
    In addition to dike repairs and river channel regulation, another powerful factor that enables us to overcome floods is the active and organized defense force of the people of the whole country. This is also one of the important characteristics of the production front in New China.
    Many rivers in China cause floods mainly due to siltation. The sediment brought by floods gradually raises the riverbed in the lower reaches, the river channel cannot be fixed, and the flood defense capacity of the dikes is also gradually weakened. To solve this problem, it is necessary to afforest, plant grass, improve farming methods, and build terraced fields and check dams in the upper reaches of each river to prevent flood erosion. This is something that many water conservancy experts knew in the past, but because this work must be carried out under the leadership of the government, mobilizing the majority of the people, and carrying out long-term work, it can be effective, so it could never be realized in old China. Since the establishment of the People's Government, starting in 1950, in the upper reaches of the Yi River and Shu River in Shandong, in the upper reaches of the Daqing River in Hebei, in the upper reaches of the Liao River in Northeast China, in the upper reaches of the Yellow River in Northwest China, in the upper reaches of the Yongding River in Chahar, and in the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan, under the leadership of the local governments, organized farmers have built tens of thousands of slow-water dams and, in coordination with agricultural and forestry departments, have begun to transform the mountainous areas. The development of this work has already played a part in the current struggle against floods, and it will play a greater role in the future.
    Another massive mass work is flood control during the flood season. In these three years, every year before the arrival of the flood season, in most parts of the country, under the personal leadership of the local responsible leaders, flood control command organizations have been established, the people have been mobilized to conduct a general inspection of all flood control projects; in coordination with the postal and telecommunications departments, a national-scale flood reporting network has been established; when the flood arrives, the people along the river are organized to patrol the dikes to prevent accidents. The combination of powerful defense projects and powerful flood control organizations can gradually reduce the area affected by floods nationwide. This has played an important role in ensuring the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in our country.
    (IV) Rapid Development of Farmland Irrigation
    In the past three years, the Chinese people have also made great achievements in developing irrigation, increasing production, and preventing drought.
    In these three years, a total of 358 modern irrigation projects have been launched nationwide, and these projects have also provided greater guarantees against drought. Among them, the larger ones include the Yellow River's diversion irrigation project in Jiwei, which currently irrigates 480,000 mu and will be expanded to more than 1 million mu in the future. It can also supplement the dry water flow of the Wei River, making the 900-kilometer waterway from Xinxiang to Tianjin open year-round. The four major irrigation projects in Dongliao River, Panshan, Chahayang, and Guoqian Banner in Northeast China have already irrigated more than 600,000 mu of farmland and will be expanded to more than 4 million mu in the future. The Huangyangzha project in Suiyuan has improved the water supply and control of the Huangji Canal, Yangjiahe Canal, and Ula River Canal, which can not only eliminate the disaster of flooding, but also gradually increase the irrigated area by more than 1 million mu. The silt irrigation projects in Sanggan River, Hun River, and Yu River in Chahar, which utilize floodwater for irrigation, currently irrigate 300,000 mu of farmland and can be gradually expanded to 980,000 mu. The newly built irrigation projects in Hutuo River, Xiao River, and Zeyuan Canal in Shanxi Province can irrigate more than 600,000 mu of farmland. The renovation and expansion of Jing, Wei, Luo, Han, Bao, and Xu canals in Shaanxi Province will increase the irrigated area by more than 500,000 mu. In Xinjiang Province, the irrigation undertaking has had even greater development, due to the vigorous operation of farmland reclamation by the People's Liberation Army. As for the Subei Irrigation Main Canal on the Huai River, although the main project has been completed, it is not included in the calculation because the branch canals have not yet been built.
    At the same time as these projects, people's governments at all levels have also vigorously promoted the development of mass irrigation. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 3.36 million small canals and water storage ponds and dikes have been newly built and renovated nationwide. Some of these projects have expanded the irrigated area, while others have increased the water storage capacity, so that the originally irrigated farmland can obtain an appropriate amount of irrigation water for a longer period of time, thereby reducing and preventing drought disasters. A total of 668,000 new and repaired wells have been dug and repaired nationwide, and 293,000 waterwheels have been loaned, so that the utilization of groundwater in various places has been universally developed. In addition, 117,500 horsepower of mechanical irrigation and drainage equipment has been restored and increased, which has also greatly helped to increase irrigation and remove waterlogging and ponding.
    In addition, in the past, during the reactionary rule, irrigation projects such as canals and ponds were controlled and manipulated by the landlord class. There were many disputes among them, and powerful landlords monopolized the use of water sources, resulting in great waste in the use of water in the original irrigation equipment. After the establishment of the People's Government, the management of various irrigation equipment was strengthened, democratic reforms were universally implemented, and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was accepted and promoted, paying attention to economic water use, which has played a great role in the current expansion of irrigated areas. This work will continue to be strengthened in the future.
    (V) Conclusion
    In the past three years, the main reasons why we have been able to achieve such achievements are due to Chairman Mao's great encouragement and call, the strong and effective leadership of the Communist Party of China, the superiority of the New Democratic political system, and the combination of new ideas, new labor attitudes, and new levels of production technology produced under this new system. The help of the Soviet Union's advanced experience has also played an important role.
    The liberated people have become the masters of their own production undertakings, and production efficiency has rapidly improved. In the past, the efficiency of earthwork was one cubic meter or less per person per day, but now it has generally increased to four or five cubic meters in many areas, and there are individual teams and groups that have achieved eight or ten cubic meters per person per day for the entire team and group. With the help of the Soviet Union's advanced experience, the Chinese people have rapidly mastered advanced science and technology. The Runheji diversion sluice, which controls the main stream of the Huai River, built in 1951, has a total width of 557 meters. It only took three months from start to finish. This year, the Jingjiang flood diversion project on the Yangtze River, one sluice is more than 1,000 meters long, and the other sluice is more than 330 meters long, took only 75 days in total.
    In the past three years, the funds used by the People's Government for water conservancy construction were 18 times the most of any one year during the Kuomintang reactionary rule in 1950, 42 times in 1951, and 52 times in 1952. Water conservancy construction is entirely peaceful construction. The fact that our government has used such a huge amount of funds on water conservancy construction clearly shows to the whole world what the intention of the Chinese people is. Our intention is to peacefully build our own happy life. We never invade others, and we resolutely oppose others invading us. We support peace and are willing to stand with peace-loving friends all over the world to resolutely repel the war-mongers' attack on peace. (Xinhua News Agency)

    三年来我国水利建设的伟大成就
    中央人民政府水利部部长　傅作义
    （一）导语
    三年来我国人民在水利建设方面已经获得很大的成就。
    在这三年当中，经过全国人民的努力，我们已经改变了国民党反动统治时期河道失修的状态，基本上解除了我国人民几千年所受洪水灾害的严重威胁，保证了大部地区农业生产和人民生活的安全。一九四九年全国水灾面积在一亿亩以上，一九五○年为六千万亩左右，一九五一年为二千一百万亩左右，一九五二年截至九月二十日为一千六百余万亩。这个统计数字说明，全国水灾面积是在逐年迅速缩小之中。
    在这三年当中，我国人民在水的利用上也有巨大的发展。截至一九五二年六月，华北地区灌溉面积比一九四九年增加一倍。雨量缺少的西北地区，一九四九年平均尚只三人两亩水浇地，但现在已发展到平均每人一亩水浇地。三年来全国共扩大灌溉面积约四千九百五十余万亩。另外有一亿八千四百余万亩农田，因为增加和改善了水的供给而得免于旱灾。
    三年来我国水利事业的发展，首先是为农业的恢复和发展服务。但是，从一九五一年起，我国治水方向已经从局部治理转向于全流域的开发，从消极的除害转向于积极的兴利，从防御洪水转向于控制和利用洪水，特别是由于大量的水库的修建，我们对水的利用已趋向于多目标的开发，因此我们在农田灌溉以外，还做了一些水力发电和改进航运的事业。配合我国工业化的需要，今后这些事业还将有更大的发展。
    在我国面积这样广阔、河流这样众多、雨量变化这样悬殊的土地上，造成这样一个变化，不是一件容易的事情。三年来直接参加水利工程的人民有二千万人左右。完成土方据不完全的统计，在十七亿立方公尺以上，相当于挖掘十条巴拿马运河或二十三条苏彝士运河。另外还有数量众多的现代化建筑工程。
    （二）三年来许多河流开始进行根本的治理
    三年来，我们对于全国四万二千余公里堤防，绝大部分进行了培修。对一些水灾比较严重的河流，如淮河，华东的沂河、沭河，华北的永定河、大清河、潮白河等，已经开始进行全流域的根本治理。长江、黄河这些特别巨大的河流，因为治本工程不是短期所能完成，也举办了临时性的有效的防御措施，以解除异常洪水的威胁。
    毛主席倡导的根治淮河的工程，是新中国第一个全流域的多目标的治水的计划。它一方面要使淮河流域将近六千万人民和二十二万平方公里的土地永绝水患，同时要利用淮河的水流发展大约五千万亩的农田灌溉，改进二千公里的航道系统，并配合农工业动力的需要，建造一定数量的水力发电站。为达到这个目标，正在举办着三类工程：一类是蓄水工程，要在淮河各个支流的上游兴建十三处蓄水库，并在沿淮十七处湖泊洼地修建控制工程，共蓄水二○○亿立方公尺，借以控制和调节淮河的水量，使它在洪水时期不致泛滥成灾，在枯水季节有充足的水量供给灌溉、航运和发电的需要。一类是河道整理工程，包括疏浚旧河，开挖新河，修堤和展宽堤距等。要求干支流的河道能安全宣泄经过蓄洪调剂以后的洪水，并恢复广大地区内被破坏了的排水系统。完成这些措施，可以免除洪水的泛滥和数千万亩农田的涝灾。另一类是发展水利的工程，就是利用水库湖泊拦蓄的水，举办灌溉和水力发电工程，并修建船闸，整理航道，以改进淮河的航运事业。其中利用洪泽湖水灌溉的苏北灌溉渠，即可保证和扩展灌溉面积二千五百万亩。将来淮河、苏北灌溉总渠，和运河、长江的航道联接起来，汽轮航行可自上海北至陇海铁路，东至黄海，西至河南京汉铁路。
    治淮工程从一九五○年冬季开工，现在已进行到第二年度。在控制洪水方面，已完成水库三处，湖泊洼地蓄洪工程十五处，可以控制洪水一百亿立方公尺。在整理河道方面，共修复干支流堤防二千一百九十余公里；二十几条支流，有的进行了彻底的疏浚，有的进行了初步的疏浚，共完成疏浚工程二千八百八十公里。苏北的灌溉总渠一七○公里的干渠和主要水闸都已完成。配合蓄洪、灌溉、修堤和疏浚工程，共修建涵闸一百三十八座。其中淮河干流上的润河集分水闸，苏北灌溉总渠上的高良涧进水闸，运东分水闸，和东、西淝河的控制闸都是很大的水闸。这些工程已经使淮河流域的人民摆脱了水灾的经常威胁，即使遇到最大洪水，也可保证主要地区不致受灾，并为淮河流域水利资源的全面开发打下了基础。至于全部工程，则须到一九五五年才能完成。
    黄河是世界闻名的多灾的河流，根据历史上二千五百年的记载，平均十年就有四次决口。可是自从
    一九四七年黄河下游大部解放到现在已经六年的时间，虽曾发生几次巨大的洪水，但在人民力量的防卫下，都已平安度过。几年来我们做了八千二百余万立方公尺的土工，一百七十几万立方公尺的石工，使黄河下游河南、平原、山东三省的一千三百公里的大堤一般高出最高水位一·五至二·五公尺，所有临水的险工坝埽，除去山东利津一段以外，都把临时性的秸埽换成了巩固的石工。特别是最近二年广泛推行了平原省农民靳钊所创造的锥探堤防的方法，对两岸大堤普遍进行了锥探检查，在古老的堤防内部，发现三、四万处獾洞鼠穴都进行了整理修补，堤防工程乃达到了空前的巩固。
    为了防御异常洪水，并解除下游解冻时期冰凌壅塞所造成的灾害，一九五一年又举办了北金堤滞洪工程和山东利津县溢水堰工程。
    自有比较详细的纪录以来，黄河发生的最大洪水，一次是一九三三年，一次是一九四二年。就水量来说，一九三三年洪水量比一九四二年更大。修筑了北金堤滞洪工程以后，已可保证黄河即便遇到一九三三年的洪水，也可不致发生重大灾害。另外黄河从济南到海口一段，在春季融冰的时候，有时上游河水已经解冻而下游冰冻尚未全开，以致冰凌壅塞形成冰坝，阻碍水流，造成决口，在山东利津县修建的溢水堰工程，已经初步解决了这一问题。至于黄河的治本工程，目前也正在积极准备之中。
    长江是比黄河灾害较少的河流，可是根据历史上的纪录，较大的水灾平均亦达十年一次。因为水量过大，问题亦不易解决。湖北的荆江段又是长江水灾威胁最严重的一段。
    三年来我们整理了长江中下游的堤防，全流域共做土工二亿一千七百余万立方公尺，现在干流堤防已可保证历年最高水位（按不同地段分别为一九三一及一九四九年洪水位）不生溃决。为了解除荆江段的严重水灾，一九五二年举办了荆江分洪工程，一方面加强长江左岸一一四公里的荆江大堤，另一方面确定长江右岸虎渡河以东、荆江右堤以西、安乡河以北，共九二一平方公里的低洼地区为分洪区。修建了长达一○五四·三七五公尺的进水闸，和长达三三六·六公尺的节制闸，做为操纵控制的机关。这样，长江万一遇到一九三一年的最大洪水，分洪区可以分蓄长江一部分流量，降低长江水位，以保障荆江两岸人民的安全。
    华东的沂河、沭河流域，是一个历史性的灾区。这些河流，先前是和汝水、泗水汇入淮河入海。由于历史上黄河对淮河河道屡次的侵袭，使这些河流失去了通畅的入海的道路，它们在下游互相沟通，互相侵扰，一个河道涨水，各河都要发生水灾。常年受灾的地区，约有一千六百余万亩。从一九四九年到一九五二年，苏北和山东的人民，修建了长达一百八十余公里的沂河新道，和长达六十九公里的沭河新道，使两河洪水有了适当的宣泄的道路。对于流域以内的排水河道进行了普遍的疏通整理，以减少涝灾。为了维持运河的航道，并且整修了淮阴船闸，在皂河镇新修了船闸和节制闸。现在不但是沂河、沭河流域已经获得两年的丰收，并且改善了中运河的航道，废弃百年的中运河恢复通航。
    华北的白河水系，五条大河都在天津经海河入海，各河上游源短流急，洪水的来量很大，而海河则容纳不了这些洪水，所以在河北省经常发生严重的水灾。现在已经开始进行根本治理的有潮白河、永定河和大清河。
    潮白河在一九五○年完成了下游新道，已经可以初步防御较大洪水不致成灾，上游的水库正在筹建。永定河在下游进行了堤防的整理和加强，上游开始进行了水土保持工作，另外计划修建三个水库，其中最大的官厅水库已经开工，一九五三年洪水到来以前即可基本完成。这个水库完成以后即可基本消灭永定河的水患，并且可有一定数量的水力发电、城市工业用水和农田灌溉的利益。大清河在下游开辟一个分水的减河，一九五一年已经完成一部分闸坝工程，一九五三年可全部完成，上游的水库也在进行基础钻探和其他准备工作。
    此外，广东的珠江，湖北的汉水，三年来都进行了大规模的整修堤防。华东区的浙江、江苏和上海市沿海一带，有共长五七六·四三公里的海塘，保护着沿海一带一千四百余万亩农田。这些海塘，在国民党反动统治时期，多年失修，经过人民政府两年来巩固加强，及今年七月巨大台风的实际考验，已可分别在八级至十级台风情况下，保证一九四九年最高潮水位不生溃决。
    （三）强大的防御工程和强大的防汛组织相结合，使水灾面积逐年缩小
    在堤防整修和河道的治理以外，使我们能够战胜洪水的另一个有力的因素，是全国人民积极的有组织的防御力量。这也是新中国生产战线上的重要特点之一。
    中国有许多河流所以发生水灾，主要是因为泥沙淤塞所致。洪水带来的泥沙使下游河床逐渐抬高，河槽不能固定，堤防防御洪水能力也被逐渐减弱。要解决这个问题，必须在各河上游造林、植草、改良农作方法、修造谷坊梯田，以防止洪水冲刷。这是过去许多水利学者都知道的事情，可是因为这一工作必须在政府领导之下，发动多数人民，长期进行工作，才能收到效果，所以在旧日中国永远不能实现。自从人民政府成立以后，从一九五○年起，在山东的沂河、沭河上流，在河北的大清河上游，在东北的辽河上游，在西北的黄河上游，在察哈尔的永定河上游，在河南的淮河上游，都已在地方政府领导下，由组织起来的农民，修建起数以万计的缓水坝，并配合农林部门开始进行山区的改造。这一工作的发展，对现在与洪水的斗争，已经起了一部分作用，将来还要起更大的作用。
    另一个群众性的巨大工作，是在洪水时期的防汛工作。在这三年当中，每年在洪水到来以前，全国大部地区，都在地方负责首长的亲自领导下建立起防御洪水的指挥机关，发动人民，对所有防洪工程进行普遍的检查；配合邮电部门，建立全国规模的报汛网；到洪水到来的时候，沿河人民有组织地上堤巡守，以防止发生意外。强大的防御工程和强大的防汛组织相结合，全国水灾面积才能逐渐缩小。这对我国农业生产迅速的恢复与发展起了重要的保证作用。
    （四）农田灌溉事业的迅速发展
    三年来，在发展灌溉、增加生产和防止旱灾的工作上，我国人民也有很大的成就。
    在这三年当中，全国共举办现代化的灌溉工程三百五十八处，这些工程对于防止旱灾也有较大的保证。其中较大的如黄河的引黄灌溉济卫工程，现在灌溉面积四十八万亩，将来可发展至一百万亩以上，并可补给卫河的枯水流量，使新乡到天津九百公里的航道终年畅通。东北的东辽河、盘山、查哈阳、郭前旗四大灌溉工程，现在已经灌溉农田六十余万亩，将来可扩展到四百余万亩。绥远的黄杨闸工程，改善了黄济渠、杨家河、乌拉河三渠水量的供给和控制，不但可以免除泛滥的灾害，并可逐步增加灌溉面积一百余万亩。察哈尔的桑干河、浑河、御河等淤灌工程，利用洪水灌溉，目前已灌农田三十余万亩，可逐步扩展到九十八万亩。山西新建的滹沱河、潇河及泽垣渠等灌溉工程，共可灌溉农田六十余万亩。陕西省整理扩充泾、渭、洛、汉、褒、湑等渠即增加灌溉面积五十余万亩。新疆省由于人民解放军大力经营农田垦殖，灌溉事业有更大的发展。至于淮河上的苏北灌溉总渠，主要工程虽已完成，但因分支渠道尚未修筑，没有计算在内。
    和这些工程同时，各地人民政府也大力推进了群众性灌溉事业的发展。根据不完全的统计，全国新建和整修的小型渠道和蓄水塘堰共三百三十六万余处，这些工程有的是扩大了灌溉面积，有的是增加了蓄水容量，使原来灌溉的田亩在较长的时间内都可得到适量的灌溉用水，因而减免了旱灾。全国新凿和修复水井共六十六万八千眼，贷放水车二十九万三千辆，使各地对于地下水的利用，得到普遍的发展。此外还恢复和增加了机械灌溉排水工具十一万七千五百马力，对于增加灌溉和排除内涝渍水也有很大的帮助。
    另外，过去在反动统治时期，渠道塘堰等灌溉工程是在地主阶级操纵把持之下，他们中间存在着很多争执，有势力的地主垄断水源的利用，使原来的灌溉设备在水的使用上存在着很大的浪费。人民政府成立以后，加强对各种灌溉设备的管理，普遍实行民主改革，并且接受推广苏联先进经验，讲求经济用水，这对现在扩充灌溉面积，已经起了很大作用。这方面的工作将来还要继续加强。
    （五）结束语
    在三年的时间里，我们所以能够获得这样的成就，主要的原因是由于毛主席伟大的鼓舞号召，是由于中国共产党坚强有力的领导，是由新民主主义政治制度的优越，以及在这个新的制度下所产生的新的思想，新的劳动态度和新的生产技术水平相结合的结果。苏联先进经验的帮助，也起了重要的作用。
    解放了的人民，自己做了生产事业的主人，生产效率就迅速提高。土工效率过去是每人每日一公方或不到一公方，现在有很多地区已普遍提高到四公方五公方，并有个别的队、组，全队全组做到每人每日八公方十公方。在苏联先进经验的帮助之下，我国人民已经迅速地掌握了进步的科学技术。一九五一年建筑的控制淮河干流的润河集分水闸，口门总宽五五七公尺。从开始到完成只用了三个月的时间。今年长江上的荆江分洪工程，一个闸长千余公尺，另一个闸长三百三十余公尺，总共只用了七十五天的时间。
    三年以来，人民政府所用在水利建设方面的经费，一九五○年相当国民党反动统治时期水利经费最多一年的十八倍，一九五一年相当四十二倍，一九五二年相当五十二倍。水利建设完全是和平建设，我国政府用在水利建设上的经费有这样巨大的数量，这可以清楚地向全世界说明：我国人民的意向是什么。我们的意向是要和平地建设自己的幸福生活。我们从来不去侵略别人，也坚决反对别人侵略我们。我们拥护和平，并愿和全世界的和平友人站在一道，坚决打退战争贩子对和平的进攻。（新华社）
