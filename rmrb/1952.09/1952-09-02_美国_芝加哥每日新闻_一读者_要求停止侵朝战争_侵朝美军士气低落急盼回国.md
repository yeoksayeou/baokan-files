Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from New York (TASS): The American "Chicago Daily News" published a letter from a Chicago reader, Preston, on August 22nd, responding to the newspaper's August 18th editorial, "Do You Remember Korea?"

The letter said: "We remember Korea every time we hear new news of American soldier casualties. We remember Korea every time we see photos of soldiers and civilians, Americans and Koreans, being bombed, burned, and maimed. We cannot forget Korea, and no politician can make us forget Korea, not now, and not on election day. Neither Eisenhower nor Stevenson has provided a reason for us to believe that American foreign policy, that policy representing a hateful symbol, will change, regardless of who is elected between the two. The candidates are now worried that voters may not vote in the election. Only if they come up with a peace program will we vote for them, will we go to the election booths in large numbers. Let them formulate their program in a language we understand. Stop the Korean War! Stop it immediately! Conclude an agreement to exchange all prisoners of war! Conclude it immediately! Announce that war is not inevitable, immediately convene a conference of major powers, and open the way to lasting peace."

Xinhua News Agency, August 1st dispatch from New York (TASS): The New York "World Telegram and Sun" published a report by a United Press reporter, which stated: The morale of American troops in Korea is low. The report said that American troops in Korea are impatiently waiting for the day of rotation, waiting for the day to leave Korea. The report also said: "A near-desperate atmosphere pervades all parts of the front. The rotation system has new and significant meaning, because those who are rotated out mean getting rid of Korea." It can be seen from this report that the U.S. side's delay in the Korean armistice negotiations has made American soldiers extremely disappointed.

    美国“芝加哥每日新闻”一读者
    要求停止侵朝战争
    侵朝美军士气低落急盼回国
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国“芝加哥每日新闻”八月二十二日刊载了芝加哥读者普罗斯顿的来信，回答该报八月十八日的社论
    “你记得朝鲜吗？”
    这封信说：“每当我们听到美国士兵伤亡的新消息的时候，我们就记起朝鲜。每逢看到军人和平民，美国人和朝鲜人，被炸弹炸死、烧死和残废的照片的时候，我们就记起朝鲜。我们忘不了朝鲜，什么政治家都不能使我们忘记朝鲜，现在没有忘记，在选举的日子中也不会忘记。不论艾森豪威尔或是史蒂文森都没有提供理由使我们可以认为：美国的外交政策，那个代表可恶象征的政策，会有所改变，不管他们两人中间谁当选。候选人现在担心的是：选民在选举时也许会不投票。只有他们拿出和平纲领来，我们才会投他们的票，才会大批大批地走向选举柜。让他们用我们懂得的语言制订他们的纲领吧。停止朝鲜战争！立即停止！缔结交换全部战俘的协定！立即缔结！宣布战争不是不可避免的，立即召开大国会议，开辟走向持久和平的道路。”
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：纽约“世界电讯太阳报”发表合众社记者的报道，其中说：朝鲜美军士气低落。报道中说，朝鲜美军急不可耐地等待着轮换的日子，等待着离开朝鲜的日子。报道中又说：“近乎绝望的气氛笼罩着前线各地。轮换制具有新的重大意义，因为被换掉的人意味着从朝鲜摆脱出来。”从这个报道中可以看出，美方拖延朝鲜停战谈判使美国士兵极感失望。
