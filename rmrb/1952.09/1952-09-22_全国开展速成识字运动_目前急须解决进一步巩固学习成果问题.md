(Our report) The quick literacy campaign has rapidly unfolded across the country. In addition to the People's Liberation Army, which has basically completed quick literacy education and is now striving to improve its cultural and scientific knowledge, quick literacy methods have begun to be gradually implemented throughout the country. To date, in the North China Administrative Region alone, 1.08 million people have enrolled. After next spring, a large-scale national anti-illiteracy campaign will begin.

Most provinces and cities have now established leading bodies to promote the quick literacy campaign, conducting extensive publicity and mobilization, typical surveys of illiteracy, allocating cadres, training teachers, compiling teaching materials, and conducting key experiments. Some regions will soon formulate preliminary plans for comprehensively carrying out the quick literacy campaign; other regions, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Xinjiang, will postpone the literacy campaign until next year due to the implementation of land reform. Tianjin and Hebei and Shanxi provinces have fully launched the quick literacy campaign. According to preliminary plans in various regions, the campaign will generally first eliminate illiteracy among cadres, industrial workers, and young and middle-aged farmers, and then eliminate illiteracy among trade workers and older farmers. The North China and Northeast China administrative regions have both decided to eliminate illiteracy among all cadres, industrial workers, and young and middle-aged farmers in their respective regions within three to five years. The national railway system has also begun to fully implement the quick literacy method. Of the approximately 240,000 illiterate and semi-literate people throughout the railway system, more than 90 percent will enroll this winter, striving to eliminate all illiteracy by the first half of next year.

Key experimental work in various regions generally adopts two methods: concentrated study away from production and spare-time study. All places that have implemented the teaching policy of "linking with reality and following the mass line" have achieved excellent results. After about 300 hours of study (including review time), general illiterate or semi-literate workers and peasants can recognize and write from memory 1,900 to 2,100 characters. The best performers can recognize more than 2,500 characters, while the worst can recognize about 1,500 characters. During the extensive reading stage, each student generally reads more than 60,000 to 70,000 characters. Generally, students can read popular newspapers and various popular books and periodicals in their regions, and can write short articles and letters. Many outstanding students have become instructors or mass teachers after graduation. After initially mastering the tool of literacy, workers and peasants have further enhanced their political enthusiasm and production initiative. Workers are enthusiastically reading texts promoting advanced experiences. Zhou Fuying, a fine yarn worker at Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill, only knew how to do what others taught her when she first started learning the Hao Jianxiu work method, and her ability to tend machines increased to 37 spinning rollers (about 300 spindles). After becoming literate through quick literacy, she carefully studied the Hao Jianxiu work method herself, understood the spirit of this method, and her ability to tend machines increased to 400 spindles. In the production increase competition, her ability to tend machines has continued to improve, and recently it has increased to 800 spindles. Her political level has also greatly improved, and she is now striving to join the Youth League.

The quick literacy campaign has also greatly enhanced the enthusiasm and confidence of the broad masses of cadres, workers, and peasants in learning culture. In many regions, the number of people requesting to participate in learning and actually participating in learning has greatly exceeded the original plan. Li Fengshan, a farmer in Fangtou Village, Baoding City, approached the village branch secretary eight times in a row after hearing a report from students in the experimental class, requesting to participate in learning. Many who did not register would rush to listen outside the windows of the literacy class; some farmers, fearing that they would not be able to register, paid for books before the class started, and some automatically invited teachers or graduated students to teach. In the rural areas of the old liberated areas in the north, the opening ceremony of the literacy class was always a large meeting, with gongs and drums, and high-flying colorful arches to show celebration. Respecting teachers and loving students has become a new trend. In many places, teachers and students have established patriotic pacts, with teachers guaranteeing teaching and students guaranteeing learning. Many farmers brave the wind and rain, getting up early and working late to go to the central village to study. Xinhua bookstores in various counties have found it impossible to meet the demands of the masses, textbooks are snapped up as soon as they arrive, and popular reading materials are always in short supply. The number of readers in rural libraries has also increased unprecedentedly.

Experience in various regions has proven that massively training teachers is a key to carrying out the quick literacy campaign on a large scale. The Northeast Region has trained 44,000 teachers, Hebei Province has trained 26,600 teachers, and Shandong will train 100,000 teachers before the start of winter school this year. The main method of training teachers in various regions is to combine it with experimental work, that is, to listen to reports and study documents on the one hand, and to observe and apprentice on the spot, and conduct trial teaching on the other. Various regions have achieved successful experiences in this regard. Tianjin has also trained more than 7,400 mass teachers, who are workers, shop assistants, housewives, street activists, etc. They have personally experienced the pain of being illiterate and are familiar with the lives and language of the masses. In teaching, they can closely grasp the ideological situation of the masses, and conduct lively and vivid teaching starting from the things that the masses are most familiar with, so the effect is excellent. However, the general cultural and professional level of mass teachers is relatively low. Tianjin and Heilongjiang have decided to improve the cultural and professional level of mass teachers through intensive training and other methods.

The most important issue at present is the issue of consolidating the achievements of quick literacy. In some units, many students, shortly after graduating and returning to their production or work posts, experience a large number of "relapses." There are many reasons for this phenomenon, mainly the following: (1) Teachers do not pay enough attention to consolidation work; (2) Students lack a learning environment after quick literacy and do not review well; (3) There is no further reading of popular books and newspapers to consolidate existing achievements and expand the scope of language application. This issue must be taken seriously by all relevant parties and resolved in a timely manner, otherwise it will inevitably affect the effectiveness of the quick literacy campaign.

The second urgent problem to be solved is the problem of guaranteeing study time. At present, the study time of employees in many units cannot be guaranteed. According to the experience of various regions, the problem of study time can be solved if the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League are in sync, scientifically allocate spare time, streamline meetings, and reduce or suspend other spare-time activities. The key to this issue lies in whether leading cadres attach importance to the quick literacy campaign.

As for the phenomenon of being eager for quick results and acting rashly, although it has been criticized repeatedly, this phenomenon still exists. The above-mentioned phenomena are all obstacles to carrying out the quick literacy campaign and must be resolutely overcome.

    全国开展速成识字运动
    目前急须解决进一步巩固学习成果问题
    【本报讯】速成识字运动已在全国范围内迅速展开。除人民解放军全军已基本上完成了速成识字教育，现正进一步为提高文化科学知识而奋斗外，全国各地，都已开始逐步推行速成识字法。到目前为止，仅华北行政区，就有一百零八万人入学。明春以后，大规模的全国扫除文盲运动即将展开。
    现在绝大部分省、市已经建立了推行速成识字运动的领导机构，广泛进行宣传动员、文盲典型调查、配备干部、培养师资、编印教材、重点实验等工作。其中一部分地区即将制订全面开展速成识字运动的初步计划；另一部分地区如广东、广西、云南、新疆等地，因为实行土地改革，识字运动要延至明年进行。天津市及河北、山西等省已全面展开了速成识字运动。各地初步计划，一般都先扫除干部、产业工人和青壮年农民中的文盲，然后扫除行业工人和老年农民中的文盲。华北、东北两大行政区，都决定在三、五年内扫除全区干部、产业工人和青壮年农民中的文盲。全国铁路系统也开始全面推行速成识字法。全路约有二十四万文盲与半文盲，其中百分之九十以上将在今冬入学，争取明年上半年消灭全部文盲。
    各地重点实验工作，一般采取脱离生产集中学习和业余学习两种方式。凡是贯彻了“联系实际，走群众路线”的教学方针的地方，都获得优良成绩。经过大约三百小时左右（包括复习时间）的学习，一般文盲或识字不多的工农群众，都能认识和默写一千九百字到二千一百字。成绩好的有认识二千五百字以上者，最差的也可认识一千五百字左右。在大量阅读阶段，每个学员大抵都阅读了六、七万字以上，一般学员大体上能阅读本地区的通俗报纸和各种通俗书刊，能写简短的文稿和书信。许多成绩优异的学员结业后担任了辅导员或群众教师的工作。工农群众在初步掌握文字工具以后，更加提高了政治热情和生产积极性。工人们狂热地阅读推广先进经验的文字。武汉第一纱厂细纱工人周福英开始学习郝建秀工作法时，只知道照别人教给她的做，看车能力增加到三十七个毛辊（约三百锭子）。她在速成识字后，自己仔细研究了郝建秀工作法，领会了这个方法的精神，看车能力提高到四百个锭子。在增产竞赛中，她的看车能力又不断提高，最近已提高到八百个锭子了。她的政治水平也大大提高，现在她正在争取入团。
    速成识字运动也大大提高了广大干部和工农群众学习文化的热情和信心。在许多地区，要求参加学习和实际参加学习的人数，大大地突破了原订计划。保定市?舫头村农民李凤山，听了实验班学员的报告后，一连找了村支部书记八趟，要求参加学习。许多没有报上名的，便赶至识字班窗外旁听；有些农民怕报不上名，未开班先交了书钱，也有自动地请了教师或结业的学员上课的。在北方老解放区的农村，识字班开学典礼总是开大会、敲锣打鼓、高扎彩坊表示庆祝。尊师爱生成了新风气。许多地方教师和学员订立了爱国公约，教师包教、学员包学。许多农民不避风雨，每天起早摸黑赶到中心村学习。各县新华书店都感到无法满足群众的要求，教科书一来就抢购一空，通俗读物总是供不应求。农村图书馆的读者也空前激增。
    各地经验证明：大量培养师资是大规模地开展速成识字运动的重要关键。东北区已训练师资四万四千人，河北省训练了二万六千六百人，山东在今年冬学开始前将训练十万师资。各地培养师资主要采取和实验工作结合的方法，就是一面听报告、学习文件，一面实地观摩、随班见习、进行试教。各地在这方面都取得了成功经验。天津并已培养了七千四百多名群众教师，成分是工人、店员、家庭妇女、街道积极分子等。他们亲身经历过不识字的痛苦，又熟悉群众的生活和语言，在教学中能紧紧掌握群众的思想情况，从群众最熟悉的事物出发，进行生动活泼的教学，因此效果极好。但群众教师一般文化、业务水平较低，天津、黑龙江决定用集训等办法提高群众教师的文化和业务水平。
    当前最重要的问题是巩固速成识字的成果问题。有些单位许多学员毕业后，回到生产或工作岗位不久，又发生大量“回生”现象。发生这一现象的原因是多方面的，主要是下列几种：（一）教员不够注意巩固工作；（二）学员速成识字后缺乏学习环境，没有很好复习；（三）没有进一步阅读通俗书报，巩固已有的成果和扩大语文应用范围。这个问题必须引起各有关方面的严重注意，及时加以解决，否则必然要影响速成识字运动的成效。
    第二个急待解决的问题是保证学习时间的问题。目前许多单位的职工学习时间不能得到保证。根据各地经验，如党政工团步调一致，科学地支配业余时间，精简会议，减少或暂停其他业余活动等，学习时间问题是可以解决的。这一问题的关键就在于领导干部对速成识字运动是否重视。
    至于急于求成，草率从事的现象，虽然受到了一再的批判，但这种现象依然存在着。上述种种现象，都是开展速成识字运动的障碍，必须切实加以克服。
