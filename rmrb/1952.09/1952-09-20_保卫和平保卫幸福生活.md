    Defend Peace, Defend Happy Life
    Editor: We, the students of Peking University, unanimously and enthusiastically support the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. We feel immensely honored that this conference can be held in our country's capital - Beijing. We understand that this conference is of great significance for striving for peace in Asia and the world, and we believe that this conference will achieve great success.
    During this summer vacation, some of our classmates visited factories and saw workers creating many new production records in the patriotic production increase and economy practice movement, and many models of conscious labor emerged; some classmates just returned from traveling in the countryside and saw that farmers' production had increased and their lives had improved in the bumper harvest movement, and newly built houses often accounted for one-third of the entire village in many places; the motherland is vigorously constructing, and everywhere is a scene of prosperity. And all students in national universities, secondary technical schools, and normal schools have also enjoyed public funding since September this year. We know that a happy life is closely linked to peace. Without peace, a happy life is threatened. Therefore, we must strive for peace and defend our happy lives with the attitude of masters. We have decided to do a good job in adjusting departments and faculties, to create better conditions for future learning; to intensify physical exercise and continuously improve our political consciousness, and to greet the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference with practical actions. We believe that the awakened people of the world will surely have the power to stop war and defend peace.

    保卫和平保卫幸福生活
    编辑同志：我们北京大学的学生一致热烈拥护即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。我们为这个会议能在我国的首都——北京召开而感到无比的光荣。我们懂得，这个会议对于争取亚洲和世界和平有着重大的意义，相信这次会议将会获得重大的成就。
    在今年暑假期中，我们有的同学参观了工厂，见到工人在爱国增产节约竞赛运动中创造了许多生产新纪录，出现了许多自觉劳动的模范事迹和人物；有的同学刚从农村旅行回来，看到农民在丰产运动中，生产提高了，生活改善了，许多地方新盖的房子常常占全村的三分之一；祖国在蓬蓬勃勃地建设，到处一片欣欣向荣的气象。而我们全国高等学校和中等技术学校及师范学校的学生，从今年九月份起，也全部享受了公费待遇。我们知道：幸福的生活是与和平紧接在一起的，没有和平，幸福的生活就受到威胁。所以我们要用主人翁的态度来争取和平，保卫自己幸福的生活。我们决定搞好调整院系工作，为今后的学习创造更好的条件；加紧锻炼身体和不断地提高政治觉悟，以实际行动来迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开。我们相信，觉醒了的世界人民，一定有力量制止战争，保卫和平。
