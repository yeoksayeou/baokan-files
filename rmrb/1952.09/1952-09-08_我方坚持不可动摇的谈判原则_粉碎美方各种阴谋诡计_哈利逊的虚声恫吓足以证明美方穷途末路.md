Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 6th: Our correspondent comments on the current situation of the Korean armistice negotiations, stating: At the plenary session of the two delegations to the Korean armistice negotiations on September 4th, the U.S. chief negotiator, Harrison, openly expressed the U.S. intention to break off the negotiations and made threats. He said, "It is useless to negotiate with the Communists on any reasonable and armistice basis." He also said that if the Korean-Chinese side did not accept the U.S. claim to retain prisoners of war, "the people of North Korea would suffer from disease, displacement, and the gradual destruction of economic life."

Harrison's pretentious and blackmailing attitude is enough to prove that he is at the end of his rope. Indeed, since Harrison took over the so-called "unenviable" position of Joy, his situation in Panmunjom has become increasingly embarrassing. Washington let him implement three "brilliant plans" to force our side to yield, but they all failed.

First, the tactic of prolonged recess has not achieved the goal of blackmail at all. On June 7th, Harrison, with a red face and ears, fled the meeting in the middle of it, unilaterally adjourning the meeting for the first time for three days. General Nam Il clearly told him: This childish act cannot shake the firm position of the Korean-Chinese side. Three months have passed, and Harrison has gone from repeatedly adjourning the meeting for three days to repeatedly insisting on adjourning the meeting for a week. Facts have proved that this trick, in addition to further exposing the U.S. attempt to obstruct the armistice, has yielded no results. Even the reactionary American newspaper "Christian Science Monitor" worriedly stated: "The recess has produced an effect that was not originally expected, and as the Allied forces continue to exercise this fruitless policy, it sometimes seems to be in danger of failure."

Secondly, the means of sowing discord has failed. On July 13th, Harrison proposed the numbers of retaining 20 percent of the Korean People's Army prisoners of war and 68 percent of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, attempting to sow discord between the Korean and Chinese people by centrally detaining Volunteer Army prisoners of war. General Nam Il again clearly told him: The Korean and Chinese people have established an unbreakable friendship in the struggle against aggression, and this despicable conspiracy of the U.S. is doomed to failure. Two months have passed, and Washington's scheme has completely failed. However, Harrison was ordered to continue to recite those few spells of discord at the meeting and openly play the despicable role of a disrupter.

Washington's third "brilliant plan" was to devote all its efforts to waging war against the peaceful people of Korea and implement the "military pressure" of indiscriminate bombing. More than two months have passed, and the American air bandits have intensified their slaughter of women and children. But this can only strengthen the Korean and Chinese people's anger for revenge, and they are giving the American executioners increasingly heavy punishment with their rapidly growing air defense forces. Van Fleet also desperately called out in Seoul on the 5th: "Air pressure alone cannot defeat the Communists."

The facts of the past three months have proved that the Korean-Chinese side, under the U.S. provocations inside and outside the meeting, has shattered the U.S.'s various conspiracy "brilliant plans," adhered to the negotiations, and insisted on resolving the issue through negotiations. Under our side's serious blows and just demands, the U.S. revealed its true colors and openly threatened to break off the negotiations, saying that "it is useless to negotiate with the Communists on any reasonable and armistice basis." Obviously, Washington does not yet have a fourth "brilliant plan." Therefore, when Harrison returned to Panmunjom, he could only resort to boasting and empty threats. But the American imperialist paper tiger has long been unable to scare people. Let all prisoners of war go home, and the Korean armistice can be achieved immediately. This is the firm and unshakable principle of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting on the 4th, General Nam Il told Harrison decisively: "If your side does not abandon your absurd claims, your ending will undoubtedly be a complete failure."

### 我方坚持不可动摇的谈判原则  粉碎美方各种阴谋诡计  哈利逊的虚声恫吓足以证明美方穷途末路

    我方坚持不可动摇的谈判原则
    粉碎美方各种阴谋诡计
    哈利逊的虚声恫吓足以证明美方穷途末路
    【新华社开城六日电】本社特派记者评论朝鲜停战谈判的目前形势说：在九月四日的朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，美方首席谈判代表哈利逊公然表示美方破裂谈判的意图，进行威胁。他说：“和共产党在任何合理和停战的基础上进行谈判都是无用的。”他又说，如果朝中方面不接受美方扣留战俘的主张，“北朝鲜人民就要遭受疾病、流离失所和经济生活的逐渐毁灭。”
    哈利逊这种装腔作势的讹诈态度，恰足以证明他的穷途末路。的确，哈利逊自接替了乔埃的所谓“无可羡慕的”职位后，他在板门店的处境是愈来愈狼狈了。华盛顿让他执行了三条“妙计”，俾图迫使我方屈服，结果一一破产。
    首先，长期休会的策略丝毫没有达到讹诈的目的。六月七日，哈利逊面红耳赤地中途逃离会场，第一次片面休会三天。南日将军明白对他说过：这种幼稚的行径决不能动摇朝中方面坚决的立场。三个月过去了，哈利逊由一再逃会三天进而一再坚持休会一周。事实证明，这种伎俩除了进一步暴露美方阻挠停战的企图外，毫无结果。连美国反动报纸
    “基督教科学箴言报”也忧虑地说道：“休会产生了一种不是原来所期望的效果，由于联军继续行使这个无结果的政策，有时候看来很有失败的危险。”
    其次，挑拨离间的手段破产了。七月十三日，哈利逊提出了扣留百分之二十人民军战俘和百分之六十八中国人民志愿军战俘的遣俘数字，企图以集中扣留志愿军战俘的办法来挑拨朝中人民的关系。南日将军又清楚地告诉他：朝中人民已经在反侵略的斗争中建立了牢不可破的友谊，美方这种卑劣阴谋是注定要失败的。两个月过去了，华盛顿的计谋完全失灵。但哈利逊却奉令仍要到会场来继续背诵那几句挑拨符咒，公开扮演一个离间者的卑鄙角色。
    华盛顿的第三条“妙计”是倾全力对朝鲜的和平人民进行战争，实施狂轰滥炸的“军事压力”。两个多月过去了，美国空中强盗加紧进行着对妇女儿童的屠杀。但是这仅能加强朝中人民复仇的怒火，他们正用迅速增长的空防力量给美国刽子手以日愈沉重的惩罚。范佛里特五日也在汉城绝望地呼叫道：“单靠空中压力是不能打败共产党的。”
    三个月来的事实证明：朝中方面在美方会内外的挑衅之下，已经粉碎了美方的各种阴谋“妙计”，坚持了谈判，并坚持在谈判中解决问题。美方在我方严重的打击与正义的主张之下，显出了他们的本相，公然威胁要破裂谈判，说什么“想和共产党在任何合理及停战的基础上谈判都是无用的。”显然，华盛顿现在还没有第四条“妙计”。因而哈利逊回到板门店时，也只有自吹自擂、虚声恫吓这一途可循。但是美帝国主义这只纸老虎早已不能吓人了。让所有战俘回家，朝鲜停战立即可以达成，这就是朝中方面坚决不可动摇的原则。在四日的会上，南日将军曾经斩钉截铁地告诉哈利逊：“如果你方不放弃你们的荒谬主张，你们的结局无疑将是彻底的失败。”
