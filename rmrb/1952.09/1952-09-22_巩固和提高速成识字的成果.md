    Currently, the accelerated literacy campaign is gradually expanding and deepening, creating many new experiences and achieving great results. A surge of enthusiasm for cultural learning has emerged among workers and peasants in many places. However, some noteworthy issues have also emerged in the movement and must be addressed in a timely manner to ensure the smooth progress of the movement. For example, some regions and units cannot adequately guarantee study time, leaving the students' learning in an irregular state, which affects the effectiveness of teaching and the students' learning enthusiasm. Some units have a desire for quick success and act rashly, preventing the accelerated literacy method from playing its due role, which also affects the students' learning enthusiasm. The most serious problem related to the above situation is that many students in some units forget some or most of the characters they have learned shortly after graduation. Such "relapses" have occurred in Wuhan, Tianjin, and many other places. Therefore, how to consolidate and improve the students' literacy achievements has become the central issue in the current accelerated literacy movement.
    According to materials from various places, the reason why literacy achievements cannot be consolidated and "relapse" occurs is primarily because leading cadres and teachers in accelerated literacy teaching did not pay attention to gradually consolidating the students' learning achievements. Accelerated literacy education is a blitz-style education, and if one is not careful, it can easily lead to "half-baked" phenomena. It is necessary to frequently conduct in-depth investigations and research on the students' ideological and learning situation at each stage of teaching, pay attention to the acceptance ability and consolidation degree of learning achievements of the majority of them, and always pay attention to the actual teaching effect. The necessary study time must be guaranteed, the basic teaching steps of the Qi Jianhua accelerated literacy method must be followed, and the teaching methods must be continuously improved according to the specific situation of the students. Phased blitz and phased review should be well coordinated to prevent the phenomenon of "large-scale blitz, large-scale dropout." Whether in terms of the entire teaching process or each teaching step, a certain teaching effect must be achieved, and a necessary foundation must be laid for the students in reading, writing characters, and writing compositions before the accelerated literacy graduation. Any crude approach is prone to cause the "half-baked" phenomenon, and "half-baked" is the primary reason for "relapse."
    The second reason for the "relapse" phenomenon is that some students lack a continuing learning environment after graduating from accelerated literacy. According to reports from various places, some students have good academic performance and full learning enthusiasm, but after returning to their work posts, they feel that there is no time to study; others cannot solve the difficulties in learning because there is no one to help them, and their enthusiasm gradually declines, and eventually they simply stop learning. Some students have poor determination and insufficient initiative and enthusiasm. Once they leave the learning post, they want to "take a breather." Without a learning atmosphere and collective help, their learning achievements will be difficult to consolidate. According to the above situation, leading cadres of work units should attach great importance to the results of the students' intensive learning and create a regular learning environment for them in various ways according to the actual situation, such as planning to equip appropriate books and newspapers and organizing various forms of self-study and mutual assistance activities. Units that do this not only do not have the "relapse" phenomenon, but also continuously improve the students' literacy and writing skills.
    It must be emphasized here that the large-scale compilation and printing of appropriate popular reading materials has become an urgent task for China's cultural and educational circles. There are too few existing excellent popular reading materials to meet the current actual needs. If this problem is not solved, the consolidation and improvement of the literacy achievements of the vast number of students will lack a sufficient guarantee. Relevant leading authorities and organizations must quickly organize forces and regularly carry out this work in a planned way.
    Existing experience proves that eliminating illiteracy is a very arduous and complex task, which can only be gradually completed with the close cooperation of all forces. We must not only give full play to the great role of the Qi Jianhua accelerated literacy method, but also continuously improve the cultural level of the working masses on the basis of accelerated literacy. Only in the case of continuous improvement can the results of learning be effectively consolidated.

### 巩固和提高速成识字的成果

    巩固和提高速成识字的成果
    目前速成识字运动正在逐步扩大和深入，创造了不少新的经验，获得了巨大的成绩，在许多地方涌起了工农群众学习文化的热潮。但在运动中也出现了一些值得注意的问题，必须及时加以解决，以便运动顺利前进。例如有些地区有些单位不能很好保证学习时间，使学员们的学习陷于不经常的状态，影响了教学的效果和学员的学习情绪；有些单位则有急于求成，草率从事的现象，使速成识字法不能发挥应有的作用，同样影响学员的学习情绪。而与上述情况有关的最严重的问题，就是某些单位许多学员在结业以后，不久便把一部分或大部分已经学得的字忘记了。武汉、天津以及其他许多地方，都发生了这样的“回生”情况。因此，如何巩固、提高学员们的识字成绩，就成为当前速成识字运动中的中心问题。
    根据各地的材料，识字成绩之所以不能巩固而发生“回生”现象，首先因为教学领导干部和教师在速成识字教学过程中没有注意逐步巩固学员们的学习成果。速成识字教育是一种突击式的教育，一不当心，就容易产生“夹生”现象。必须在每个教学阶段经常深入调查研究学员们的思想情况和学习情况，注意他们中大多数人的接受能力和学习成果的巩固程度，要时刻注意教学的实际效果。必要的学习时间，必须加以保证，祁建华速成识字法的基本教学步骤，必须遵守，而且要根据学员们的具体情况，不断改进教学方法。分段突击与分段复习要很好配合，防止“大量突击，大量掉队”现象的产生。不论就整个教学过程说或就每一教学步骤说，都要获得一定的教学效果，一定要在速成识字结业以前，在阅读、写字、写话等方面为学员们打好必要的基础。任何粗糙的作法都容易引起“夹生”现象，而“夹生”正是“回生”的首要原因。
    产生“回生”现象的第二个原因，就是某些学员在速成识字结业以后缺乏继续学习的环境。根据各地反映的情况，有些学员的学习成绩不坏，学习情绪也很饱满，但回到工作岗位之后，就觉得没有时间学习了；有的因为没有人帮助，无法解决学习的困难，情绪渐渐下降，到后来索性不学了。有些学员则由于决心较差，主动性积极性不够，一离开学习岗位，就想“松一口气”，如无学习空气和集体帮助，他们的学习成绩就很难巩固。根据上述情况，工作单位的领导干部应该十分重视学员们紧张学习的成果，根据实际情况，用各种方法为他们创造经常学习的环境，例如有计划地置备适当书报，组织各种方式的自学互助活动。凡是这样做的单位，非但没有“回生”现象，而且学员们的识字和写作水平都不断提高。
    在这里必须着重指出：适当通俗读物的大量编印，已经成为我国文化教育界刻不容缓的迫切任务。现有的优良通俗读物太少了，不能满足当前的实际需要。这个问题如不解决，则广大学员速成识字成绩的巩固和提高，就缺乏充分的保证。有关领导机关团体必须迅速组织力量，有计划地经常进行这一项工作。
    已有经验证明：扫除文盲是非常艰巨复杂的工作，只有在各方面力量紧密配合之下，才能逐步完成。我们非但要充分发挥祁建华速成识字法的巨大作用，而且要在速成识字的基础上不断提高劳动群众的文化水平。也只有在不断提高的情况下，学习的成绩才能切实巩固起来。
