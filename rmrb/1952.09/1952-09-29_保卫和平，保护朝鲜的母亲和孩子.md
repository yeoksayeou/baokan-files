    Defend Peace, Protect the Mothers and Children of Korea
    Ba Jin
    A grave crime has been committed on this land for two years, and it continues to expand. Every inch of Korean soil is stained with the blood of its peace-loving people. As a member of humanity, and as a Chinese literary worker on the Korean front, I feel it is my responsibility to accuse the US imperialists of their atrocities to the representatives of all countries participating in the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference: I ask you and the sixteen hundred million people of the Asian and Pacific region you represent to rise up and stop this inhuman crime, extinguish the flames of war in Korea, and protect the mothers and children of Korea. I have a responsibility to speak for the mothers and children of Korea, because I am still on this suffering, heroic land, living with the mothers and children of Korea. I have seen the families destroyed by war and the cities ruined by bombs. I have seen the suffering and struggle of the Korean mothers and children.
    Korea, this country of green mountains and clear waters, this excellent and passionate nation. Everyone who has been to Korea praises the Korean people for their bravery, optimism, hard work, and endurance. They can sing, dance, love peace, and love life; they like to wear brightly colored clothes and hope to live peaceful and happy lives. Young mothers carry their children on their backs and work in the fields, and the elderly take hoes to dig soil and build roads. Factories are smoking, mines are producing, and children are studying in schools. They have never harmed a single hair on an American's head, nor do they ever want to change the lifestyle of Americans who live far across the ocean. They work tirelessly day and night, dedicating themselves to building their homeland, only hoping that peace will bring them happiness. The Korean people have always loved peace and needed peace.
    The Korean people are not only willing to live in peace with their neighbors, but they are also willing to live in peace with the people of the whole world, even the American people. However, the US imperialists have groundlessly occupied the land of Korea, dropping millions of tons of bombs on prosperous cities and peaceful villages, and the invading troops have slaughtered peaceful people with all kinds of barbaric and cruel methods. What kind of words can I use to describe the blood debt owed by the American aggressors in Korea? What kind of description can I use to describe the cruel scenes of those mass graves and ten-thousand-person pits?
    The suffering and struggle of the Korean people have stirred the conscience of the Chinese people and inspired the Chinese people's will to fight. When Korean women were violated, the old and weak were killed, and young heroes used their blood to defend their motherland, the Chinese people sent their excellent sons and daughters to organize the Chinese People's Volunteers, crossed the Yalu River, and fought side by side with the Korean people, using their blood to consolidate the friendship between the two nations, repelled the brutal enemy, protected the mothers and children of Korea, struck at the arrogance of the aggressors, and forced them to accept the peace proposals put forward by the Chinese and Korean people. The peace-loving people of the world hope that in the armistice negotiations in Kaesong and Panmunjom, the American aggressors will learn a lesson from their failures and accept the fair and reasonable peace terms of the Chinese and Korean people, and stop the war of aggression against Korea.
    But the US aggressors have ulterior motives. They do not want peace. Not only do they try every possible means to delay the negotiations, but they even use all kinds of conspiracies and tricks to sabotage the negotiations during the negotiations, and carry out inhuman germ warfare, massacring and detaining Chinese and Korean prisoners of war. Recently, in order to publicize their so-called "air superiority" and implement their so-called "military pressure," they have intensified their aerial slaughter of Korean mothers and children.
    I cannot find appropriate language to describe to you the feelings of a young mother holding her child and lying on the ground waiting for the bombs to fall; nor do I need to bring you pain with the tragic scene of broken legs and shattered limbs, flesh and blood flying everywhere. You may not understand the painful sleepless nights I experienced when I read the records of the continuous bombing of Pyongyang, because you have not seen the peaceful, kind, and enthusiastic people there who have an extremely strong desire to survive and who always have smiles on their faces. I will only tell you two small things from the countryside: One night, when the flares dropped by American planes hung on the mountain opposite my "earth house," illuminating the front of the "earth house" like daytime, a Korean mother with one child on her back and another holding her hand lifted the rain cloth of the "earth house" and ran inside, saying repeatedly: "Airplane, really deadly." What words should I use to comfort this Korean mother? Another dusk, I went to a village I had visited a few days ago. An old man was squatting in front of his burned-down house, staring blankly at the pile of rubble. I spoke to him, but he remained silent for a long time. He looked at me blankly, with hatred, pain, and something else in his eyes that I could not understand for a while. I knew that when the enemy planes bombed this house, an old woman and four children died on the spot, and three other children were injured. Thinking of those Korean children who loved to sing and dance, what words should I use to comfort this Korean father and husband? What should I say to the suffering, peaceful Korean people?
    You and the sixteen hundred million people you represent know what to say to them. You have the power to comfort the suffering, peaceful Korean people. Because you have the power to extinguish the flames of war and defend peace. Yes, you must stop the US imperialists' war of aggression, stop the US aggressors' crimes of slaughtering the Korean people, and protect the mothers and children of Korea.
    Korea is now the forefront of defending world civilization, and the Korean people are bravely working side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers to defend peace. They are resolutely fighting against all the evil acts of aggression by the US imperialists to defend peace and protect the harmed mothers and children. Protecting the mothers and children of Korea is also protecting the mothers and children of the entire Asian and Pacific region. Because if people do not repel the enemy on this suffering land, defeat the arrogance of the aggressors, and if people do not shatter the conspiracies and evil schemes of the US imperialists here, then today's Korea may be tomorrow for many countries in the Asian and Pacific region, and everyone knows that American planes have always disregarded national borders on the map.
    I have personally witnessed the suffering and struggle here, and I believe that I have a responsibility to speak for the Korean mothers and children who live in cellars, at the foot of mountains in grass sheds, in simple air-raid shelters, and in dilapidated thatched huts, to speak for the Korean women who risk enemy fire to plant rice and vegetables in the fields near the front lines, and to speak for the children who study and sing in schools under the threat of enemy planes. The Korean people are not only fighting for their own peace and happiness, but they are also fighting for the peace of the entire Asia and the Pacific region, and for the happiness of the people of the entire Asia and the Pacific region. The struggle of Korea is a warning to the entire Asia and Pacific region. Now is not the time to watch the fire from the other side of the river. Everyone must rise up and put out the fire in time, lest the fire in one place spread to the entire region. Kind-hearted people who love peace will not forget the mothers and children of Korea in suffering. The mothers and children of Korea are concerned about this conference being held in Beijing. They believe that you and the good people you represent will unite and work together to extinguish the flames of war and defend peace. So let us put aside differences in thought, religion, language, ethnicity, and system, and unite closely, and strive to defend the happy lives of the mothers and children of Korea and the entire Asia and Pacific region!

### 保卫和平，保护朝鲜的母亲和孩子

    保卫和平，保护朝鲜的母亲和孩子
    巴金
    一种严重的罪行在这个国土上进行了两年，而且一直在继续扩大。朝鲜的每一寸土地都染满了它的爱好和平的人民的鲜血。作为人类的一分子，作为在朝鲜前线的一个中国文学工作者，我认为我有责任向参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的各国代表控诉美帝国主义的暴行：我要求你们和你们所代表的亚洲和太平洋区域的十六亿人民起来制止这种违反人道的大罪，扑灭朝鲜的战火，保护朝鲜的母亲和孩子。我有责任替朝鲜的母亲和孩子讲话，因为我现在还在这个受难的英雄的土地上，跟朝鲜的母亲和孩子生活在一起。我看见了战争破坏的家庭和炸弹毁灭的城市，我看见了朝鲜的母亲和孩子的苦难和斗争。
    朝鲜，这个山青水秀的国家，这个优秀的热情的民族。到过朝鲜的人都赞美朝鲜人民勇敢、乐观、刻苦、耐劳。他们能歌，善舞，爱和平爱生活；喜欢穿颜色鲜明的衣裳，希望过安宁幸福的日子。年轻的母亲背着孩子在田野工作，老年人拿着锄头在挖土筑路。工厂在冒烟，矿山在生产，孩子们在学校里念书。他们从没有损害过美国人的一根头发，也绝不想改变远隔重洋的美国人的生活方式。他们终日终年不休息地埋头生产，用自己的劳力建设祖国，只希望和平给他们带来幸福。朝鲜人民在任何时候都是爱好和平而且需要和平的。
    朝鲜人民不仅愿意跟他们的邻人和平相处，他们也愿意跟全世界人民甚至美国人民和平相处。可是美帝国主义者毫无理由地侵占了朝鲜的国土，把千万吨的炸弹投在繁荣的城市和平静的乡村，侵略的军队用种种野蛮、残酷的方法屠杀和平的人民。我能够用什么样的话语来说明美国侵略者在朝鲜欠下的一笔血债呢？我能够用什么样的描写来说明那些千人冢万人坑的残酷景象呢？
    朝鲜人民的苦难和斗争激动了中国人民的良心，鼓舞了中国人民的斗争的意志。当朝鲜的妇女被凌辱、老弱被残杀，年轻的英雄们用自己的血保卫他们的祖国的时候，中国人民派遣了他们的优秀的儿女组织人民志愿军，跨过鸭绿江和朝鲜人民并肩向前，用他们的血巩固了两个民族的友谊，打退了残暴的敌人，保全了朝鲜的母亲和孩子，打击了侵略者的气焰，迫使他们不得不接受中朝人民提出的和平建议。全世界爱好和平的人民希望在开城板门店的停战谈判中间美国侵略者能从失败中得到教训接受中朝人民的公平合理的和平条件，停止对朝鲜的侵略战争。
    可是美国侵略者别有用心。他们不愿意和平。他们不仅千方百计地拖延谈判，他们甚至在谈判的期间使用各种阴谋毒计破坏谈判，并且进行灭绝人性的细菌战争，屠杀和扣留中朝的战俘。最近为了宣传他们的所谓“空中优势”实施他们的所谓“军事压力”，更加紧进行着对朝鲜母亲和孩子的空中屠杀。
    我找不出适当的语言向你们叙说年轻的母亲抱着孩子伏在地上等待炸弹落下时的心情；我也没有必要用断腿裂肢、血肉横飞的惨象给你们带来痛苦。我读到平壤连续被炸的记载时所经历过的那些痛苦的不眠的夜，你们也许不会了解，因为你们没有看见那里的求生欲望极其强烈、脸上常带笑容的和平、善良、热情的人民。我只向你们叙述两件乡村里的小事：一个夜晚，美国飞机投下的照明弹挂在我的“地屋子”对面的山上，把“地屋子”门前照得像白天一样的时候，一个朝鲜母亲背上背一个孩子，手上牵一个孩子揭开“地屋子”的雨布跑进里面来，连说着：“飞机，真要命。”我应该用什么话去安慰这个朝鲜的母亲呢？另一个黄昏，我到几天前我去过的一个村子里。一个老人正蹲在自己的被烧毁的房屋前面，望着瓦砾堆出神。我跟他讲话，他许久都不做声。他茫然地望着我，眼光里有仇恨，有痛苦，还有别的，我一时不能了解的东西。我知道敌机炸毁这房屋的时候，有一个老太太和四个小孩当场死去，还有三个小孩负伤。想到那些爱唱歌爱跳舞的朝鲜孩子，我应该用什么话去安慰这个朝鲜的父亲和丈夫呢？我应该对受苦的、和平的朝鲜人民讲些什么话呢？
    你们和你们代表的十六亿人民知道应该对他们讲些什么话。你们有力量安慰受苦的和平的朝鲜人民。因为你们有力量扑灭战火，保卫和平。是的，你们必须制止美帝国主义者侵略战争，制止美国侵略者屠杀朝鲜人民的罪行，保护朝鲜的母亲和孩子。
    朝鲜现在是保卫世界文明的最前线，朝鲜人民英勇地跟中国人民志愿军并肩努力保卫和平。他们坚决地跟美帝国主义者一切罪恶的侵略暴行作斗争，来保卫和平，来保护被伤害的母亲和孩子。保护朝鲜的母亲和孩子也就是保护全亚洲及太平洋区域的母亲和孩子。因为要是人们不在这个受难的土地上打退敌人，打垮侵略者的气焰，要是人们不在这里粉碎美帝国主义者的阴谋毒计，那么朝鲜的今天也可能是亚洲及太平洋区域许多国家的明天，谁都知道美国飞机一向就轻视地图上的国境线。
    我亲眼看见这里的苦难和斗争，我认为我有责任替那些住在地窖里，住在山脚下草棚中，住在简单的防空洞内，住在破旧的茅屋里的朝鲜的母亲和孩子说话，替那些冒着敌人炮火在邻近前线的田地上种稻种菜的朝鲜妇女说话，替那些在敌机威胁下在学校里念书唱歌的儿童说话。朝鲜人民不仅是为着自己的和平与幸福在斗争，他们也是为着全亚洲、全太平洋区域的和平，为着全亚洲、全太平洋区域的人民的幸福。朝鲜的斗争是对全亚洲及太平洋区域的一个警告。现在不是隔岸观火的时候。大家必须起来及时把火扑灭，免得一个地方的火延烧到全个区域。爱好和平的善良的人是不会忘记在苦难中的朝鲜的母亲和孩子的。朝鲜的母亲和孩子关心着在北京召开的这个会议。他们相信你们和你们所代表的善良的人民会团结起来，共同努力，扑灭战火，保卫和平。那么让大家撇开思想、宗教、语言、民族、制度的差异，紧密地团结起来，为着保卫朝鲜的和全亚洲、全太平洋区域的母亲和孩子的幸福生活而奋斗！
