    The Problem of Work Delay for Village Cadres Participating in Mutual Aid Teams' Meetings Should Be Resolved
    Editor: A common problem exists within the mutual aid teams of Tongbai County, Henan: If township and village cadres participating in mutual aid teams lose work time due to meetings, should the mutual aid team record work points for them? Township cadres generally have some allowances, so even if some work is missed due to meetings, the problem isn't too significant. Village cadres don't have any allowances, and while they spend less time in district meetings, they spend a lot of time in township meetings. If their production is delayed, and the team doesn't record work points for them, they must pay out of their own pockets when settling accounts. Because of this reason, some village cadres have developed the idea of not wanting to be cadres. Zhao Yunxi, a farmer from the Third Team of Xishilipu Township, First District, was elected as a village people's representative. Because he often lost work due to meetings, he requested the team to record work points for him, but the team disagreed. He said to everyone:
    "Being a representative only leads to losses, I don't want to be one anymore, let you all be representatives and see." Some mutual aid teams, fearing that township and village cadres' work delays due to meetings would cause losses to the entire team, are unwilling to let them participate in the mutual aid teams.
    I believe this problem must be resolved. The solutions are: Firstly, district and township leading organs should minimize meeting times as much as possible, so that village cadres lose less work time; Secondly, political education should be strengthened for township and village cadres, so that they truly recognize that being a cadre is to serve the people and is glorious; Thirdly, whether the mutual aid team records work points for production time lost due to meetings should be handled according to the actual situation. The village should also find ways to take care of them.  Xu Zhengmou

### 参加互助组的乡村干部开会误工的问题应予解决

    参加互助组的乡村干部开会误工的问题应予解决
    编辑同志：河南桐柏县的互助组内目前普遍存在着一个问题：参加互助组的乡、村干部，因开会耽误了生产时间，互助组是否给他们记分？乡干部一般都有一些供给，即使开会误了一些活，问题还不大。村干部没有一点供给，到区开会时间还少，在乡开会时间很多，耽误了生产，组里不给记分，结账时便须出工资。由于这个原因，有一部分村干部便产生了不愿当干部的思想。第一区西十里铺乡第三组农民赵运喜被选为村人民代表，他因常开会误工，要求组里给记分，组里不同意。他对大家说：
    “当代表光吃亏，我不当了，让你们也当当看。”也有一些互助组因害怕乡、村干部开会误工，使整个组吃亏，不愿让他们参加互助组。
    我认为这个问题必须解决，解决的办法是：第
    一、区乡领导机关应尽量减少开会时间，使乡村干部少误工；第二、应该对乡村干部加强政治教育，使他们真正认识当干部是为人民服务，是光荣的；第三、因开会耽误了生产时间，互助组是否记分，应按实际情况来处理。村里也应想法加以照顾。  许正谋
