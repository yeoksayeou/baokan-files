Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 4th - All South Korean POWs in our No. 8 Jiangdong POW Camp, which has repeatedly suffered from barbaric US air raids, held a rally on August 31st to protest the US Air Force's atrocities of bombing and strafing the POW camp. The POWs held up signs with slogans such as: "American Imperialism, take your bloody hands off Korea!" "We demand peace, oppose war!" "We resolutely oppose the US's vicious policy of expanding the war!" POW Li Quanchun pointed out at the meeting that the US Air Force's attack on the clearly marked POW camp was a planned and tyrannical trampling on international law and human morality. He recounted the tragic deaths and injuries of his fellow POWs. He exclaimed: Resolutely oppose death and war! Achieve a Korean armistice as soon as possible, and let American imperialism get out of Korea! POWs Jiang Ruchun, Jin Zhongjian, and others spoke successively, unanimously denouncing the shameless atrocities of the American aggressors.

The conference unanimously adopted a letter of protest at the end. The protest letter said: We were forced by American imperialism and the traitorous Syngman Rhee gang to participate in a criminal war and suffered all kinds of humiliation, abuse, and oppression. But since we became prisoners of war, we have received lenient treatment and protection in the POW camp of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and we have lived a happy life. Through our POW life, we have clearly realized the justice of the Korean people's heroic struggle for national reunification, independence, freedom, and honor, as well as world peace, and the brutality of the American imperialists' policy of aggression against Korea. In order to achieve its aggressive goals, the American robbers not only pushed us into the flames of war as cannon fodder, but also carried out beastly massacres against us after we were captured.

The protest letter said: American aerial bandits attacked the No. 8 POW camp three times, on January 14th, May 11th, and August 29th this year, brutally killing and wounding more than 100 prisoners and destroying a large number of buildings in the POW camp. The protest letter emphasized: This time, the American executioners strafed the clearly marked POW camp at low altitude in broad daylight. What is this if not a deliberately created beastly atrocity? What is this if not a tyrannical trampling on international regulations? This fact once again clearly exposes the US imperialists' attempt to undermine the armistice negotiations. We prisoners solemnly declare: We are no longer willing to be killed by the aggressors—the American robbers—nor are we willing to be deceived by them again. We consider it a great shame that we were deceived by the robbers in the past.

The protest letter concluded: We will widely tell the righteous and peace-loving people of the world about the crimes of the American cannibals in massacring prisoners. We resolutely demand that American imperialism immediately stop this atrocity, demand that they satisfy our legitimate hopes and demands, abide by international regulations, achieve an armistice as soon as possible, and let us go home and live a peaceful life. We also demand that they take their blood-stained hands of aggression back from the land of our motherland.

    我方江东战俘营战俘集会抗议美机暴行
    【新华社平壤四日电】一再遭受美机野蛮轰炸的我方第八号江东战俘营的全体南朝鲜籍战俘，在八月三十一日举行大会，抗议美国空军轰炸扫射战俘营的暴行。战俘们高举着标语牌，上面写着：“美帝国主义的血手从朝鲜缩回去！”“我们要求和平，反对战争！”“我们坚决反对美国扩大战争的凶恶政策！”战俘李权春在会上指出美国空军袭击标志鲜明的战俘营，是有计划地横暴地蹂躏国际公法与人类道德的行为。他沉痛地叙述了受难同伴们的伤亡惨状。他高呼说：坚决反对死亡和战争吧！早日达成朝鲜停战，让美帝国主义滚出朝鲜去！俘虏姜如春、金钟建等先后发言，一致痛斥美国侵略者的无耻暴行。
    大会最后一致通过了抗议书。抗议书说：我们被美帝国主义及李承晚卖国匪帮强迫参加犯罪的战争，受尽了各种屈辱、虐待和压迫。但是从我们做了俘虏以后，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的俘虏营里，我们却受到宽大的待遇和保护，过着愉快的生活。我们通过俘虏生活，清楚地认识到朝鲜人民为祖国统一独立和自由荣誉以及世界和平而进行的英勇抗争的正义性，和美帝国主义者对朝鲜的侵略政策的残暴性。美国强盗们为了达到它的侵略目的，不但把我们当作炮灰推入战争的火焰里，而且当我们被俘以后，还对我们进行着野兽般的屠杀。
    抗议书说：美国空中强盗在今年一月十四日、五月十一日与八月二十九日先后三次袭击第八号战俘营，残酷地杀伤一百多名俘虏，破坏了俘虏营的大批建筑物。抗议书着重指出：美国刽子手们这次又在光天化日之下低空扫射设有鲜明标志的俘虏营，这不是蓄意制造的野兽暴行是什么？这不是横暴地蹂躏国际法规的行为是什么？这个事实又一次清楚地暴露了美帝国主义破坏停战谈判的企图。我们俘虏们严正地声明：我们不愿再受侵略者——美国强盗的杀害，也不愿再受它的欺骗。我们认为自己过去被强盗们欺骗是极大的耻辱。
    抗议书最后说：我们要把美国吃人生番屠杀俘虏的罪行广泛地告诉爱好自由正义与和平的全世界善良人民。我们坚决要求美帝国主义立即停立这种暴行，要求它们满足我们正当的希望和要求，遵守国际法规，早日实现停战，让我们回家过和平生活。我们并要求它们把沾满鲜血的侵略魔手，从我们祖国的土地上缩回去。
