[By Our Newspaper] Workers across the country are deeply engaged in patriotic production increase and thrift competitions to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and have already achieved considerable results.

The labor competition launched by the capital's workers to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has created outstanding achievements. At the construction site of Tiananmen Square—the venue for the National Day commemorative meeting—construction workers demonstrated the wisdom and labor enthusiasm of the working class in the competition. The project they were responsible for was originally scheduled to be completed on September 20th, but during the project's progress, tasks three times greater than originally planned were added. Now, this arduous project was completed on the 25th. Workers at the People's Broadcasting Equipment Factory overcame all difficulties and completed the task of manufacturing 65 loudspeakers for the National Day commemorative meeting venue on September 14th. Coal miners at the Fangshan Mine of the Jingxi Mining Bureau continuously set four new coal production records on September 17th and 18th, increasing coal production from 4.4 cars per worker to 11.2 cars per worker. The Changxindian Railway Factory originally repaired freight cars. At the beginning of September, all employees decided to manufacture freight cars themselves to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Now they have built four freight cars. All employees of the Beijing Storage Battery Factory of the Tianjin Railway Administration have overfulfilled their annual production tasks in the competition.

Many factories in Shanghai have launched labor competitions, and output and quality have greatly improved compared to before. After the Xu Huifang and other six production teams of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill challenged the factory's workers, more than 190 teams in the factory immediately responded, and the movement immediately unfolded throughout the factory. Administrative management departments also participated in the competition on the condition of improving production efficiency. Employees of the Shanghai Private Xin Cheng Electric Appliance Factory recently successfully created a versatile "long-distance electric servo," as a National Day gift to Chairman Mao. The Huatong Electric Motor Factory completed the "Four-Product Power Switchboard" used on Tiananmen Square in the capital four days ahead of schedule. When the factory accepted this task, the workshop's work schedule had already been arranged until the end of the year, making it difficult to insert this task, but the workers squeezed out time with selfless spirit and completed it.

The patriotic production increase and thrift competition movement in Chongqing started in early September. In the past half month, employees of various factories and mines have worked hard to learn and promote advanced working methods, found many tips, and greatly improved output and quality. Cheng Helong's advanced team at the 101 Steel Plant created the "double steel feeding method" for rolling steel rails, which can increase production and save 109.6 billion yuan for the country in a year. The steelmaking workshop of the factory promoted the rapid steelmaking method, which shortened the smelting time of a furnace of steel by more than one and a half hours compared to before. The 501 Power Plant has begun to burn low-quality coal, reducing the cost of each kilowatt-hour of electricity by 4 percent. Employees of various factories and mines have put forward many rationalization proposals in the competition. The Cheng Helong team of the 101 Steel Plant put forward 40 proposals. The production of screws and nuts at the hook nail yard of the 101 Steel Plant was originally extremely unbalanced. After worker Wang Wengao put forward a rationalization proposal and improved the machine for making nuts, the production of the two was finally balanced and increased. In the short competition, many new records have emerged in various factories and mines. The straightening team of the rail yard of the 101 Steel Plant created three new records in one day on September 10th, and the efficiency of straightening and scraping steel rails exceeded the quota by 68.3 percent.

The patriotic production increase and thrift competition movement in Northeast China to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has been widely launched in various state-owned enterprises and local state-owned enterprises in various provinces and cities, and has achieved remarkable results. Employees of the State-owned Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 had already overfulfilled the annual plan to increase production and save 20,267 tons of grain equivalent on September 13th. The factory's employees are continuing to deepen the labor competition, proposing new plans to ensure that from the second half of September to the end of this year, they will increase production and save wealth equivalent to 12,732 tons of grain for the country. The goal of increasing production and saving at the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4 this year is to improve product quality and reduce production costs. By the first half of September, the product qualification rate had reached 99.61 percent, and production costs had been reduced by 9.11 percent compared to the plan, exceeding the annual production increase and savings figure by 4.85 percent. Therefore, the factory won the honorary title of advanced factory in Shenyang. A newly built large-scale thermal power plant in a certain area of Northeast China was completed one and a half months ahead of schedule and officially started generating electricity on September 21st. The mechanical equipment of this power plant is all the latest automated equipment. The completion of this large-scale power plant has timely met the increasing electricity needs of industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China in the production increase and thrift movement, and has added a source of power for the large-scale economic construction that is about to come.

The vast number of employees of local state-owned enterprises in various provinces and cities in Northeast China enthusiastically joined the patriotic production increase and thrift competition movement. In Shenyang, 36 local state-owned factories, accounting for 70 percent of the employees in the city's local state-owned enterprise system, participated in the competition. More than 150 local state-owned factory employees in Changchun have also successively proposed their own conditions and participated in the competition. In the competition, various new production records continue to emerge. For example, the pipe connection workers of the Shenyang Waterworks saved more than 100 million yuan in raw materials on one pipe connection project alone by changing the operation method, reducing costs by more than 90 percent. The Shenyang New China Glass Factory originally planned to repair a melting furnace in 45 days, but after the workers improved the labor organization, they completed all repairs in 10 days. Employees of the automobile section of the Dalian Transportation Company completed the annual production increase and thrift plan three months and twenty-two days ahead of schedule in the competition. Recently, they proposed a plan to increase production and save wealth equivalent to 1,000 tons of grain by the end of the year.

In addition, employees of the "May 1" engineering team of the State-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine continuously set new national well-sinking records in the patriotic production competition to greet National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. On September 14th, they sank 12 meters of well in one round shift (three shifts), which exceeded the national record of 10.8 meters created by the new well workers of the Pingxiang Coal Mine in June. On the 15th, on the basis of multi-head well-sinking assembly line operation, the three shifts of workers more rationally allocated labor, improved tools and operation methods, and further launched the competition. The daily progress of well-sinking reached 16.4 meters, exceeding the national well-sinking target by 134 percent, and set a new national well-sinking record. The Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government sent a telegram to congratulate them. In other places such as Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Qingdao, employees have also joined this competition and achieved many results in terms of output, quality, and other aspects.

    迎接国庆和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    各地工人深入展开竞赛
    不少单位提前完成增产节约计划创造大批新纪录
    【本报讯】全国各地工人为迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，深入展开爱国增产节约竞赛，并已有了不少成绩。
    首都工人为迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而展开的劳动竞赛，已创造了卓越的成绩。在国庆节纪念大会的会场——天安门的工地上，建筑工人们在竞赛中发挥了工人阶级的智慧和劳动热情。他们担任的工程原定在九月二十日完成，在工程进行中又追加了比原来计划多三倍的任务。现在这一艰巨的工程已在二十五日完成。人民广播器材厂的工人克服了一切困难，在九月十四日完成了为国庆节纪念大会会场制造六十五个高音喇叭的任务。京西矿务局房山矿的煤矿工人，在九月十七、十八两天当中，连续创造了四次产煤新纪录，产煤量由每工四点四车提高到每工十一点二车。长辛店铁路工厂原来是修配货车的，九月初，全厂职工决定自己制造货车来迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。现在他们已造好了四辆货车。天津铁路管理局北京蓄电池厂全体职工在竞赛中已超额完成了全年的生产任务。
    上海市不少工厂已展开劳动竞赛，产量质量较前大为提高。国营上海第一棉纺厂徐慧芳等六个生产小组向全厂工人提出挑战后，全厂一百九十多个小组马上应战，运动立即在全厂展开。行政管理部门也以提高生产效率为条件参加了竞赛。上海私营新成电器厂职工最近创造成功一种用途很广的“远距离电力随动器”，做为国庆节献礼献给毛主席。华通电机厂提前四天完成了首都天安门上用的“四品电力开关台”。当该厂接受这个任务时，车间作业计划已排到年底，很难把这个任务插进去，但工人都以忘我的精神挤出时间把它完成了。
    重庆市爱国增产节约竞赛运动，从九月初开始，半月来，各厂矿职工努力学习和推广先进工作方法，找到了很多窍门，使产量和质量大为提高。一零一钢铁厂程和龙先进小组创造了轧钢轨的“双钢喂钢法”，一年就可为国家增产节约一千零九十六亿元；该厂炼钢场推广了快速炼钢法，使一炉钢的冶炼时间比原来缩短了一小时半以上。五零一电力厂已开始燃烧劣质煤，使每度电成本降低了百分之四。各工厂矿山职工在竞赛中提出了很多合理化建议。一零一钢铁厂程和龙小组就提出了四十件。一零一厂钩钉场螺丝与螺丝帽的生产原来极不平衡，经工人汪文高提出合理化建议，改进了造螺丝帽的机器，终于使二者生产平衡上升。在为时很短的竞赛中，各工厂矿山已出现了许多新纪录。一零一厂钢轨场整理班在九月十日一天中，就连创三次新纪录，钢轨压直和刮头的效率都超过了定额的百分之六十八点三。
    东北区迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的爱国增产节约竞赛运动，已在各国营企业和各省、市地方国营企业中广泛展开，并有了显著的成绩。国营东北橡胶四厂职工已在九月十三日，提前超额完成全年增产节约二万零二百六十七吨粮食的计划。该厂职工正继续深入地开展劳动竞赛，提出新的计划，保证从九月下半月起到今年年底止，再为国家增产节约价值一万二千七百三十二吨粮食的财富。今年东北橡胶四厂增产节约的目标是提高产品质量和降低生产成本。到九月上半月产品合格率已达到百分之九十九点六一，生产成本则比计划减低了百分之九点一一；超额百分之四点八五完成全年的增产节约数字。因此，该厂获得了沈阳市先进工厂的光荣称号。东北某地新建的大型火力发电厂已提前一个半月竣工，九月二十一日正式开始发电。这个发电厂的机械设备，全部是最新式的自动化装置。这个大型发电厂的建成，及时地满足了东北工矿企业在增产节约运动中日益增加的用电需要，又给即将到来的大规模经济建设增加了动力泉源。
    东北各省、市地方国营企业广大职工热烈投入爱国增产节约竞赛运动。沈阳市有三十六个地方国营工厂占全市地方国营企业系统百分之七十的职工参加了竞赛。长春市一百五十余地方国营工厂的职工，也都先后提出自己的条件，参加了竞赛。竞赛中，各种新的生产纪录不断出现。如沈阳市自来水厂的接管工人，由于改变操作方法，仅在一处接管工程上就节约原材料一亿多元，使成本降低了百分之九十以上。沈阳市新中国玻璃厂原定在四十五天内修复一台熔化炉，但经工人改进劳动组织之后，十天内就全部修复。旅大市交通公司汽车科职工，在竞赛中提前三个月零二十二天完成了全年的增产节约计划，最近他们又提出到年底再增产节约价值等于一千吨粮食的计划。
    另外，国营焦作煤矿“五一”工程队职工，在迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的爱国生产竞赛中，连创全国砌井新纪录。九月十四日，他们在一圆班（三班）时间内砌井十二公尺，即已超过萍乡煤矿新井工人六月份创造的十点八公尺的全国纪录；十五日，三班工人在多头砌井流水作业的基础上，更合理地配备了劳动力，改进了工具和操作方法，进一步展开了竞赛，砌井的日进度达到十六点四公尺，超过国家规定的砌井指标百分之一百三十四，再创全国砌井最高纪录。中央人民政府燃料工业部特为此向他们致电祝贺。其他如天津、武汉、西安、太原、青岛等地职工也都投入了这一竞赛，并在产量、质量等方面取得了不少成绩。（附图片）
