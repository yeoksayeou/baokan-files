The theoretical study of cadres on the job in the Fifth District of Beijing Municipality began in mid-July, according to the unified plan of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. A total of 1,183 people participated in the study. Thanks to the increased awareness of cadres after the "Three-Anti" movement, their urgent demand for study, and particularly because the leadership promptly solved the ideological problems of cadres during the study and carried out criticism and self-criticism among the cadres to correct their study attitude, everyone's enthusiasm for learning was very high.

When the study began, many cadres had some incorrect understandings regarding the purpose, attitude, or method of study. For example, regarding the purpose of study: many cadres would verbally say: Study is to improve one's own political and theoretical level and awareness in order to better adapt to the needs of the revolution. However, upon examining their thoughts, many people still did not have a clear understanding of this point. Some young cadres even thought that studying was fashionable. Some people thought that studying was obeying orders, and therefore they considered studying to be a "routine formality." Regarding the attitude towards study: most cadres had a tendency to "emphasize professional work and belittle politics" (and even more so belittle theory). They felt that it was easy to see results in professional work, and superiors would easily see it. In addition, some people studied when the superiors urged them and did not study when the superiors did not urge them. There were also some student cadres who had recently joined the work force who had the problem of being hot and cold in their studies. Some started from their interests, and some were moved after watching a movie or listening to a report, and they were enthusiastic for a while, but after the event, it disappeared without a trace. Regarding the method of study: everyone felt that the most difficult thing was the problem of linking theory with practice. The phenomenon of dogmatism in study was very serious; they either deducted nouns, made empty talks, or split hairs. On this issue, there were several types: some were afraid of linking with reality, because linking with reality would require them to examine their thoughts and work and expose their shortcomings. This kind of person was a minority. Some people wanted to link with reality, but they could not find the "trick" and did not know how to start. This kind of person was the majority. In addition, some people regarded linking with reality as an easy task, and immediately took what they learned and tried to apply it to their work, but failed and became depressed. They believed that "theory does not solve problems." There were also a very few people who simply did not want to link with reality.

In light of the above situation, Li Zhesheng, the head of the Propaganda Department of the District Committee, made a report criticizing various erroneous ideas. Then, the Propaganda Department of the District Committee organized various groups to conduct discussions in connection with their thoughts. During the discussion, many comrades deeply criticized their own erroneous ideas. Since then, new atmospheres have continuously emerged in the study. The argument that there was no time to study because of busy work was no longer heard. For example, the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau used to let the study drift freely when they were busy with work; now they have established a collective study system, and everyone can persist in studying. The cadres of the Accounting Section of the Fifth District United Cooperative Society used to have a very strong purely professional viewpoint, and the study situation was not good. Recently, the General Cooperative organized a half-month of professional study, and they insisted on theoretical study. During the "classroom discussion," almost everyone prepared a speech outline.

### 中共北京市第五区区委会解决干部理论学习中的思想问题

    中共北京市第五区区委会解决干部理论学习中的思想问题
    北京市第五区在职干部的理论学习，根据中共北京市委的统一计划，自七月中旬就已开始。参加学习的共一千一百八十三人。由于“三反”运动以后干部觉悟提高，迫切要求学习，特别是由于领导方面在学习中，及时地解决了干部的思想问题；并在干部中间开展了批评和自我批评，端正了学习态度，所以大家的学习情绪很高。
    当学习开始时，无论对学习的目的、态度或方法，许多干部都有一些不正确的认识。如在学习目的方面：许多干部口头都会说：学习是为了提高自己的政治理论水平和觉悟程度，以更好地适应革命的需要。但从思想上检查起来，很多人对于这一点都还认识得不够明确。有些青年干部甚至认为学习是为了时髦。有些人则认为学习是服从命令，因而他们认为学习是“例行公事”。在学习态度方面：大多数的干部有“重业务、轻政治”（当然也更轻理论）的倾向，他们觉得业务好容易见成绩，上级也容易看到。另外有些人则是上级抓得紧就学，抓不紧就不学。还有一些新参加工作的学生干部，在学习上有忽冷忽热的毛病。有的凭兴趣出发，有的看了一次电影或听了一次报告，受到了感动，就热一阵，事过境迁又烟消云散了。在学习方法方面：大家最感到困难的是理论联系实际的问题。学习中的教条主义现象很严重，不是扣名词，发空论，就是钻牛角尖。在这个问题上，有几种类型：有的是害怕联系实际。因为联系实际就要检查思想、工作，就要暴露缺点。这种人是少数。有的人想联系实际，但找不到“窍门”，不知如何下手。这样的人是多数。另外还有些人把联系实际看成轻而易举的事，学了一点就马上拿去硬套工作，不成之后就情绪低落了。认为“理论不解决问题”。还有极少数的人，则根本不想联系实际。
    根据以上情况，区委宣传部长李哲生作了一次报告，批判了各种错误思想。然后区委宣传部又组织各小组联系思想进行了讨论。讨论中，许多同志曾深刻地批判了自己的错误思想。从此以后，学习就不断出现新气象。过去强调工作忙没有时间学习的论调，不再听到了。如公安五分局过去工作一忙，学习就陷于自流；现在订出了集体学习的制度，大家都能坚持学习。五区区联合合作社会计科的干部，过去单纯业务观点很重，学习情况不好。最近，合作总社组织了半个月的业务学习，他们坚持了理论学习。作“课堂讨论”时，几乎每个人都准备了发言提纲。
