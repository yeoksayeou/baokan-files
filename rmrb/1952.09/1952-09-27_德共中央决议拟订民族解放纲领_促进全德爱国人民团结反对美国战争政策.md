Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 25th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party held its sixth plenary session on September 21st in Düsseldorf. The meeting was presided over by the Chairman of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann.

    The plenary session adopted a resolution to draft a national liberation program. The resolution stated that this program "should promote the unity of all German patriotic elements, regardless of political views, party affiliation, and social status, to jointly oppose the war policy of the American and German imperialists, and strive for a peaceful resolution of the German question." "This program must express all the concerns, needs, and aspirations of the people, must introduce the combat experience of the national liberation movement to all the people, and must answer all the questions that are extremely important to the German nation." The Central Committee also called on all the people of West Germany to assist in drafting this program.
    Reimann spoke at the meeting, explaining the necessity of formulating a national liberation program. He said that because a choice must be made between the war-like "General Treaty" and the establishment of peaceful mutual understanding, it is necessary to formulate a national liberation program to point out the way for the people of West Germany. He said that the interests of the German nation's survival require overthrowing the Adenauer government and establishing a government in West Germany that relies on patriotic forces and immediately begins negotiations with the government of the German Democratic Republic. The meeting between Dr. Ehlers, President of the Federal Parliament, and the delegation of the People's Chamber is a victory for the German Democratic Republic's policy of establishing mutual understanding and a result of the growing strength of the patriotic movement in West Germany. This strength is reflected in the fact that approximately nine million people voted against the war-like "General Treaty" during the people's referendum. Negotiations between the German people regarding a peaceful resolution of the German question have begun, and these negotiations should continue in order to achieve the unchangeable goal of reunification. Reimann also pointed out that the German Social Democratic Party, by deepening the division of the working class ranks, is attempting to weaken the fighting strength and organization of the working class. This policy has been strongly opposed by the party's members and voters. Under these circumstances, the Communist Party must redouble its efforts to unify the actions of the working class. Reimann particularly pointed out that it is necessary to continue to strengthen the party's leadership organs, especially the party's leadership organs in the districts. To this end, it is necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below.
    The Central Committee has also decided to form a committee of nine people, including Reimann, Reschke, Niemann, and Redwin, to collect and summarize the opinions of the party's grassroots organizations and people from all walks of life in order to draft a draft of the national liberation program.

    德共中央决议拟订民族解放纲领
    促进全德爱国人民团结反对美国战争政策
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：德国共产党中央委员会于九月二十一日在杜塞尔多夫举行了第六次全体会议，会议由德国共产党主席雷曼主持。
    全体会议通过了拟订一项民族解放纲领的决议。决议说：这个纲领“要促进全体德国爱国分子的团结，以便不分政治见解、党派及社会地位，共同反对美国与德国帝国主义者的战争政策，并争取和平解决德国问题”。“这个纲领必须表达出人民全部的关心、需要和愿望，必须把民族解放运动的战斗经验介绍给全体人民，并且答复一切对德国民族极为重要的问题”。中央委员会并号召全体西德人民协助拟定这个纲领。
    雷曼在会上发言，说明制订民族解放纲领的必要。他说：因为必须在战争性的“一般性条约”和建立和平的互相谅解之间有所抉择，所以必须制订民族解放纲领，给西德人民指明出路。他说：德国民族生存的利益要求推翻阿登纳政府，要求在西德建立一个依靠爱国力量、立即与德意志民主共和国政府开始谈判的政府。联邦议会主席爱勒斯博士接见人民议会代表团就是德意志民主共和国建立互相谅解政策的胜利，是西德爱国运动力量壮大的结果，这种力量就表现在约有九百万人在人民投票期间投票反对战争性的“一般性条约”。德国人民之间关于和平解决德国问题的谈判开始了，这种谈判应该继续下去，以达到获得统一这个不变的目标。雷曼并指出，德国社会民主党用加深分裂工人阶级队伍的方法，力图削弱工人阶级的战斗力量及其组织。这个政策遭到该党党员和选民的强烈反对。在这种情况下，共产党要加倍努力使工人阶级的行动统一起来。雷曼特别指出，必须继续加强党的领导机构，首先是各区的党的领导机构。为此就要展开批评与自我批评，特别是自下而上的批评。
    中央委员会并已决定由雷曼、雷熙、努曼、莱德温等九人组成一个委员会，来搜集和总结党的基层组织与各阶层人民的意见，以便草拟出民族解放纲领草案。
