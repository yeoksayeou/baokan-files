    Congratulating the Convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Dabo Sey, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council
    When Guo Moruo conveyed the resolution of the Special Session of the World Peace Council in Berlin to the China Peace Committee, he said that in the current world situation, it is no longer a matter of defending peace, but of saving peace. This is very accurate. This sentence fully reflects the dramatic face of the era we live in, and the abhorrent war against the Korean people illustrates this era. But new forces from around the world have responded to Guo Moruo's call, and the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in a few weeks is undoubtedly one of these major forces.
    The World Peace Council, at its meeting in Berlin in February 1951, called for the organization of similar contacts between peoples of various countries in several regions of the world. The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, convened in response to this call, is indeed an important development in the world peace movement. Held two months before the World People's Peace Congress, this conference will reflect the will of the people of Asia and the Pacific region to use all their power to stop the current war and to establish peace in this region of the world. Establishing peace in this region of the world is preparing for a new era in which the friendly competition of all nations will coordinate their forces to create a happy future for mankind.
    Therefore, I wholeheartedly represent the people of Black Africa in wishing the representatives of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference a smooth and successful work. The people of Black Africa are constantly focusing their attention on the New China. China's liberation has strengthened the will and hope of all oppressed nations for independence.

    祝贺召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    世界和平理事会常务委员会副主席  达波赛
    郭沫若在把在柏林举行的世界和平理事会特别会议的决议传达给中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的时候说过，在世界目前的形势下，已经不是要保卫和平，而是要拯救和平了，这是非常确切的。这句话充分反映出我们生活的时代的戏剧性面貌，而对朝鲜人民进行的令人憎恶的战争也说明了这个时代。但是新的力量从世界各地响应了郭沫若的号召，而在几周以内将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议无疑地就是这些主要力量之一。
    一九五一年二月在柏林举行的世界和平理事会，曾号召大家在世界若干地区内组织各国人民的类似的接触。为响应这个号召而召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，的确是世界和平运动一个重要的发展。这个会议在世界人民和平大会召开前两个月举行，它将反映出亚洲和太平洋区域的人民要使用一切力量来停止现在进行的战争，要在世界这个地区内建立和平的意志。在世界这个地区内建立和平，就是为建立一个新时代作了准备，各国人民的友好竞赛将在这个时代里配合他们的力量来创造人类的幸福的将来。
    因此，我衷心地代表黑非洲的人民预祝亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表们工作顺利和成功。黑非洲人民不断地把他们的目光注视着新中国，中国的解放增强了一切被压迫民族要求独立的意志和希望。（新华社）
