Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 12th (TASS dispatch): The American air force continues to carry out barbarous large-scale air raids on Korean cities and villages. American aerial bandits once again fiercely bombed 克城 (Kecheng) in 慈江道 (Cijiang Province), which had been devastated by bombs and napalm in the autumn of 1950. This time, American bombers, fighter-bombers, and jet fighters dropped hundreds of demolition bombs and napalm bombs on the area. Entire sections of civilian houses were bombed into piles of ash-covered rubble.

The fierce air raids by American planes and jet bombers on Pyongyang and its surrounding areas are still ongoing. On September 9th, eighteen B-29 type aircraft attacked the northern district of Pyongyang, dropping approximately six hundred bombs. On September 10th, B-29 type aircraft again bombed peaceful villages along the 大同江 (Datong River) in 平安南道 (Ping'an South Province). Several villages were destroyed; many civilians were killed and wounded, the majority of whom were women and children. Several thousand "ping" (three hundred ping equals one "mu") of rice and sorghum crops were destroyed.

On the afternoon of September 10th, American jet bombers and fighters carried out another indiscriminate bombing raid on the southwestern district of Pyongyang, dropping over one hundred large bombs. Many peaceful residents were killed. The People's Hospital was directly hit and completely destroyed, and all the patients were killed.

The continuous and barbarous air raids by the American air force on peaceful cities and villages in Korea have aroused immense anger and hatred among all the Korean people.

    美机继续滥炸朝鲜和平居民
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社平壤十二日讯：美国空军继续对朝鲜城市和村庄进行野蛮的大规模空袭。美国空中强盗又猛烈轰炸曾于一九五○年秋季遭受炸弹和凝固汽油弹摧残过的慈江道的克城（译音）。这次美国轰炸机、战斗轰炸机和喷气式战斗机又向该地投下了几百枚破坏炸弹和凝固汽油弹。整片整片的民房都被炸成了一处处的盖满灰烬的土堆。
    美国飞机和喷气轰炸机对于平壤及其周围地带的猛烈空袭仍在进行。九月九日，B—二九型飞机十八架袭击平壤北区，扔下了约六百枚炸弹。九月十日，B—二九型飞机又轰炸平安南道大同江沿岸的和平村庄。好几个村庄被摧毁；有许多平民被炸死和炸伤，其中大多数是妇女和儿童。几千坪（三百坪等于一市亩）的稻米和高粱庄稼都被摧毁。
    九月十日下午，美国喷气轰炸机与战斗机又对平壤西南区进行另一次滥炸，扔下一百多颗大炸弹。许多和平居民被炸死。人民医院直接中弹，完全炸毁，所有的病人都被炸死。
    美国空军对朝鲜的和平城市与村庄的不断的野蛮空袭，已激起了朝鲜全体人民的极大愤怒和仇恨。
