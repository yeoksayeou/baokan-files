    Shanxi Province Cooperative Union's Poor Tobacco Leaf Supply Plan Causes Waste
    To the Editor: On June 13th this year, the Yuncheng Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative received instructions from the Shanxi Province Cooperative Union to supply our district with 1.05 million jin of tobacco leaves for aphid control. We immediately formulated a plan based on the actual conditions of each county and submitted it to the Provincial Cooperative, requesting them to allocate and transport the tobacco leaves according to the plan. In mid-July, the Provincial Cooperative's Production Materials Section Chief Meeting decided to change the original supply plan to 850,000 jin, with the remaining 200,000 jin to be purchased by our special district cooperative itself. We immediately made preparations according to this revised amount. However, the Provincial Cooperative did not act according to the plan. As of August 10th, it had already shipped 1,157,000 jin of tobacco leaves, exceeding the plan by more than 300,000 jin. This caused many difficulties for our cooperative in terms of warehousing and transportation. Of the tobacco leaves directly shipped to our cooperative by the Provincial Cooperative, 200,000 jin remained in stock after distribution to the county cooperatives. Due to warehousing difficulties, we had to store them in the open air. Although we tried various methods to cover and pad them, they inevitably suffered damage due to continuous autumn rains and simple facilities. According to current estimates, the losses amount to no less than 400 packages (more than 20,000 jin), equivalent to about 70 million yuan.
    The funds tied up due to delayed transportation are staggering. Aphids had become widespread in our district by early July, but the Provincial Cooperative did not start shipping aphid control tobacco leaves to the special district cooperative and county cooperatives until mid-July. By the time the tobacco leaves were transported to the counties, the aphids had basically been eradicated. As a result, more than 90 percent of the transported tobacco leaves were left in stock in the counties, tying up approximately 3 billion yuan. The masses have complained, "Sending the bowl after the meal, sending the umbrella after the rain," what is the use?
    The above situation shows that the bureaucratic style of the Shanxi Province Cooperative Union is serious, and we hope they will conduct an inspection. Peng Ruinian

    山西省合作社联合社供应菸叶计划不周造成浪费
    编辑同志：今年六月十三日，运城专区供销社接到山西省合作社联合社准备供应我区治蚜虫用菸叶一百零五万斤的指示。我们立刻根据各县实际情况，作出计划，送交省社，请他们依照计划调运。七月中旬，省社生产资料科科长会议又决定将原供应计划改为八十五万斤，其余二十万斤要我专社自行采购。我们即根据此数进行准备。但省社并不根据计划办事，截至八月十日已发来菸叶一百一十五万七千斤，超过计划三十万余斤。这样，使我社在仓库和调运方面发生很多困难。省社直接发来我社的菸叶，除发至各县社外，尚积压二十万斤。因仓库困难，只得露天存放。虽经我们多方设法加盖加垫，但因秋雨连绵，设备简陋，不免遭受损失。就目前估计，损失数字不下四百余包（两万余斤），约合七千万元。
    由于调运不及时而积压的资金是惊人的。七月上旬，我区已普遍发现棉蚜，但直到七月中旬，省社才开始给专区社和各县社调来治蚜菸叶，等到菸叶运到各县时，棉蚜基本上已经扑灭，因此，运来的菸叶有百分之九十以上积压在各县，共积压资金约三十亿元。群众纷纷反映：“饭后送碗，雨后送伞”，有什么用呢？
    以上情况，说明山西省合作社联合社的官僚主义作风是严重的，希望他们进行检查。　彭瑞年
