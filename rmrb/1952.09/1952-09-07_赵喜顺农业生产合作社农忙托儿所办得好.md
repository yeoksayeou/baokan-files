    To the Editor: The Zhao Xishun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chenzhuang Village, Datong, in order to enable women to go to the fields to participate in production and realize the slogan of "Everyone with a sickle, women in the fields, old women organized to hold the babies," established a busy season nursery based on the original five baby-holding groups (totaling thirteen children). Two elderly people and two girls (each earning four tenths of a work point in the cooperative) are responsible for taking care of twenty-three children. As a result, more than twenty female laborers in the cooperative have gone to the fields to work. The cooperative also allocated some public accumulation funds to buy toys for the children, such as balls, small drums, copper hairpins, and wooden guns. After more than two months, the children have developed the habit of collective life. In the past, when they arrived at the nursery, they either cried or ran away; now, they play with various toys, learn to sing and dance, and listen to stories, and they no longer run away. On August 21, the Yanbei Special District Patriotic Production Increase Observation Group came here to visit. The representatives were very envious to see the children singing and dancing to their hearts' content. Labor model Chi Wanku said with emotion, "The children educated by Chairman Mao are different from the past!" Some representatives said, "This is something unheard of since ancient times!"

    赵喜顺农业生产合作社农忙托儿所办得好
    编辑同志：大同陈庄村赵喜顺农业生产合作社，为了使妇女能够下地参加生产，实现“每人一把镰，妇女把地下，老婆婆组织起来抱娃娃”的口号，在原有五个抱娃娃组的基础上（共十三个孩子），成立了农忙托儿所。由两个老人和两个女孩子（每人在社内顶四厘工），负责看管二十三个孩子。因此，全社二十多个妇女劳动力都下地生产了。社内还抽出一部分公积金给孩子买了皮球、小鼓、铜钗子、木枪等玩具。经过两个多月，孩子们养成了集体生活的习惯。以前，他们到了托儿所，不是哭就是偷跑；现在，他们玩着各种玩具，学着唱歌、跳舞，听人讲故事，再也不跑了。八月二十一日雁北专区爱国丰产参观团到这里来参观，代表们看到孩子们尽情地唱着、舞蹈着，心里很羡慕。劳动模范池万库感动地说：“毛主席教养的孩子和过去不一样啦！”有的代表说：“这是从古以来没听说过的事！”　李廷选
