    1. Guarantee that the rate of first-class products reaches over 90%, and that there are no instances of using large materials for small purposes, ensuring that product quality meets the new design standards. 2. Guarantee to complete production tasks on time or ahead of schedule. 3. Learn and promote advanced experiences, find more tricks, and strive to complete the increase in production and savings worth 500 tons of grain by the end of September. 4.
