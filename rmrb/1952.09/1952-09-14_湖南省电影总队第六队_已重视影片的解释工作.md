    Hunan Provincial Film Team No. 6
    Has Emphasized the Explanation of Films
    Comrade Editor: After the People's Daily published several readers' letters regarding film publicity and explanation work, our projection team has paid attention to this work. Because we often go to the countryside to show movies to farmers, the situation of many people not understanding or misunderstanding is very serious. Recently, we first explained the film "Shangrao Concentration Camp." There were several scenes in this film that the farmers misunderstood. For example, the first scene showed Kuomintang bandit soldiers escorting New Fourth Army comrades. Initially, the audience thought they were escorting enemies. In order to prevent the audience from misunderstanding, we later explained to the audience before showing the film that those being escorted were our revolutionary comrades.
    When we explain, we point to the characters in the film and speak slowly and clearly. For example, when Comrade Qian Ziying from "Shangrao Concentration Camp" appeared on the screen, we pointed out to the audience that this was "revolutionary comrade Qian Ziying"; when the Kuomintang bandit instructor appeared, we also explained his identity to the audience. When Comrade Shi Zhen appeared, we told the audience about the atrocities suffered by Comrade Shi Zhen at the hands of the Kuomintang, which made the audience feel sad and indignant. When the secret agent beat Comrade Su Lin, many female comrades started crying. Those of us giving the explanation paid attention to changing our emotions and tones according to the development of the film's plot, which had a great impact on the audience. For example, when many comrades were collectively shot and the corpses of the comrades appeared before the audience, the explainer told the audience with angry emotions: "This is the Kuomintang slaughtering our comrades. Our revolutionary comrades suffered beatings from the Kuomintang bandits and sacrificed their lives so that the people could stand up and live a good life..." When the secret agent was beating the farmer Zhang Sifu, we said to the audience: "Folks, this is how the Kuomintang bandits beat our people!" Because we closely combined each scene with education and enlightenment for the audience, it greatly stirred up the emotions of the villagers. The masses could not restrain their indignation and spontaneously shouted slogans: "Thoroughly eliminate Chiang Kai-shek!" "Avenge the dead comrades!"
    In addition, we believe that the following points should be noted during the explanation: 1. First, understand the local audience's educational level and explain according to the different educational levels of the audience. Some audience members do not even understand the meaning of the word "rule," and only know the word "oppression," so we use "oppression" instead of "rule." In short, we should explain according to what everyone can understand. 2. Pay attention not to explain when the characters in the film are speaking, as this will hinder the audience from watching the film. The explainer should be familiar with each scene. It is best to explain first and then show the action in the film, so that the audience will know what it means at a glance.

### 湖南省电影总队第六队  已重视影片的解释工作

    湖南省电影总队第六队
    已重视影片的解释工作
    编辑同志：人民日报发表了几封有关影片宣传解释工作的读者来信后，我们放映队重视了这个工作。因为我们经常到乡村给农民放映电影，许多人看不懂或发生误解的情况是很严重的。我们最近首先对“上饶集中营”影片作了讲解，这部影片中有几个镜头农民都看错了，像第一个镜头是国民党匪军押解着新四军的同志，起初观众以为押解的是敌人。我们为了不使观众误会，以后便在放映影片前，向观众解释那些被押解的人是我们的革命同志。
    我们讲解时都是指着影片中的人物讲，讲得慢而清楚。如“上饶集中营”中的钱子英同志出现在银幕上时，我们便向观众指明这是“革命同志钱子英”；国民党的匪教官出现时，也向观众说明他的身份。当施珍同志出现时，便向观众讲施珍同志被国民党糟踏的事情，观众听了都很难过和愤恨。特务打苏琳同志时，有不少妇女同志都哭起来了。我们讲解的人注意随着影片的情节发展而改变自己的情感和声调，这样对观众的感染力量很大。如当许多同志被集体枪杀，同志们的尸首出现在观众面前时，讲解人便带着愤恨的情绪告诉观众：“这是国民党屠杀了我们的同志，我们的革命同志为了人民能翻身过好日子，而受国民党匪徒的毒打，牺牲了自己的生命。……”当特务在毒打农民张四富的时候，我们便向观众说：“老乡们，国民党匪徒就是这样毒打我们老百姓的！”因为紧紧地结合每个镜头对观众进行了教育和启发，所以大大地鼓动了老乡们的情绪，群众抑制不住愤恨的情绪，自动喊起口号：“彻底消灭蒋介石！”“为死难的同志们复仇！”
    此外，我们认为在讲解时应注意的地方是：一、首先要了解当地观众的文化程度，根据观众的文化程度不同进行讲解，有些观众连“统治”二字的含义还搞不清楚，只知道“压迫”二字，我们就用“压迫”而避免用“统治”。总之应根据大家能懂得的去讲。二、讲解时注意不要在影片中的人物讲话时去讲，这会妨碍观众看影片。讲解者应对每个镜头都要熟悉。最好讲解在先，影片动作在后，这样使观众一看就知道是什么意思了。
