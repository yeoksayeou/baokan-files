    Taiyuan Construction Engineering Company Reviews Its Mistake of Neglecting Safety Work

    Editor: Comrade Mou Jiang criticized our company for neglecting safety work in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on August 20th. We believe this criticism is completely correct.

    From July 25th to August 2nd, within nine days, the construction engineering company had five consecutive casualties. This was entirely due to the bureaucraticism and purely task-oriented viewpoint of the company's leaders. Upon careful inspection, we have fundamentally failed to value safety and health work. The fact that the company's six thousand workers do not have formal dormitories, and the temporary dormitories are not well-equipped, is a very serious problem. We solemnly accept Comrade Mou Jiang's criticism. To improve our work, we have established a safety and health committee, and each engineering team has a branch. They inspect each other once a week, and have initially stipulated a safety and health work system. In August, special personnel were organized to inspect the safety equipment of each team. The company has now allocated 150 million yuan for the needs of improving safety equipment.

    Currently, the company's casualties have been greatly reduced, but we still need to strengthen safety and health education for employees and further improve employee welfare.

    太原建筑工程公司检讨忽视安全工作的错误
    编辑同志：牟江同志在八月二十日人民日报“读者来信”栏里，批评我公司忽视安全工作。我们认为这个批评完全正确。
    七月二十五日到八月二日的九天中，建筑工程公司连续发生五次伤亡事故，这完全是由于我公司领导干部的官僚主义和单纯任务观点所致。仔细检查起来，我们对安全卫生工作根本没有重视。公司里六千名工人没有正式宿舍，临时宿舍设备也不完善，这是十分严重的问题。我们严肃地接受牟江同志的批评，为了改进工作，已成立了安全卫生委员会，各工程队设有分会，每星期互相检查一次，又初步规定了安全卫生工作制度。八月份并组织专门人员检查了各队的安全设备，公司现已拨出一亿五千万元人民币作为改善安全设备的需用。
    目前公司的伤亡事故已大大减少，但我们还须加强对职工进行安全卫生教育，进一步改善职工的福利事业。    太原建筑工程公司
