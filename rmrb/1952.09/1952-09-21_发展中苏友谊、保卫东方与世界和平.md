Propagandist's Speech

    Recently, the Chinese government delegation led by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai held talks with the Soviet government in Moscow. Marshal Stalin personally participated in the talks. On September 15, the Chinese and Soviet governments issued a communique on the talks, stating that both sides had discussed important political and economic issues related to Sino-Soviet relations; the communique also announced two documents. One is an announcement regarding the China Changchun Railway. The announcement stipulates that the Soviet government will transfer all rights to jointly manage the China Changchun Railway and all properties attached to this railway to the Chinese government free of charge, and it will be wholly owned by the Chinese government. The two governments have agreed to establish a Sino-Soviet Joint Committee to begin work to complete the transfer of the China Changchun Railway before the end of this year.
    The other document is an exchange of notes between the two foreign ministers regarding the Lushunkou Naval Base. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's note proposed to the Soviet government that, in order to safeguard peace and in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the deadline for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the jointly used Lushunkou Naval Base stipulated in the Sino-Soviet agreement on Lushunkou of February 14, 1950, be extended until China and Japan, and the Soviet Union and Japan, conclude peace treaties. Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's reply expressed agreement.
    The above-mentioned documents illustrate, on the one hand, that the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is completely sincere and selfless. The friendship between the two countries has been further consolidated and developed. On the other hand, it shows that both China and the Soviet Union are making every effort to maintain and consolidate peace. This provides a strong guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world.
        The Consolidation and Development of Sino-Soviet Friendship
    Everyone knows that the Soviet Union's friendly cooperation with the Chinese people has always been sincere and selfless. As early as more than 30 years ago, shortly after the victory of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the Soviet government automatically declared the abolition of all unequal treaties signed by Tsarist Russia with China and other weak and small nations, and renounced all the privileges of Tsarist Russia in China. During China's First Revolutionary Civil War, the Soviet Union provided tremendous assistance. As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan began, the Soviet Union immediately used a large amount of manpower and materials to help China resist Japan, and signed a treaty of non-aggression with China. In August 1945, the Soviet Union signed the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" with the then Chinese government. According to this treaty, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China, annihilated the main force of Japanese imperialism—the Kwantung Army, and forced Japan to surrender. At that time, in order to facilitate the war against Japan and prevent the resurgence of Japanese aggression, the Soviet Union also signed an agreement with China stipulating that the two countries would jointly manage the China Changchun Railway for 30 years; it was also stipulated that the Lushunkou Naval Base would be defended by the Soviet Union and jointly used by China and the Soviet Union for 30 years, while civil administration would still belong to China. The founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, fundamentally changed the situation in the Far East. The Chinese people themselves took control of the state power. The friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people was no longer subject to sabotage by reactionaries. Since then, Sino-Soviet friendship has entered a new era. On February 14, 1950, the two countries signed the great "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance"; at the same time, they signed agreements on the China Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian, stipulating that as soon as a peace treaty with Japan was signed, but no later than the end of 1952, the Soviet Union would transfer the jointly managed China Changchun Railway to China, and Soviet troops would withdraw from the jointly used Lushunkou Naval Base. At that time, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi told us: "The signing of this treaty and other agreements has given our China its own great ally that it has never had in history, thereby consolidating the victory already won by the Chinese people, enabling China's severely damaged national economy to recover and develop rapidly, and at the same time, greatly strengthening the forces of world peace, democracy and socialism led by the Soviet Union, thus increasing the guarantee of peace in the Far East and universal security in the world." (Speech at the celebration of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance on February 15, 1950) The facts of the past two years have fully confirmed Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's words. The unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union has been unprecedentedly consolidated and developed. According to incomplete statistics from September this year, the number of people across the country who have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has reached more than 38 million. More than 120,000 branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have been organized at all levels of local governments and in factories, rural areas, government agencies, and schools across the country. A soaring tide of strengthening Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from the Soviet Union has formed among the people of the whole country.
    On the Soviet side, we have seen that in successive international struggles, and in all aspects of our economic and cultural construction, the Soviet Union has given us sincere and selfless assistance. The fact that the young New China has been able to quickly heal the wounds of war, restore production, and fundamentally improve the country's financial and economic situation, consolidate national defense, and raise its international status to an unprecedented level, is inseparable from the Soviet Union's sincere assistance. Take the China Changchun Railway, for example. This railway includes two huge trunk lines (one from Manchuria via Harbin to Suifenhe; the other from Harbin to Dalian), with a total operating line of more than 3,000 kilometers. It suffered serious damage when the Japanese retreated. During the years of Sino-Soviet joint management, the Soviet Union used a large amount of manpower and materials to help us repair and build this railway, turning it into a model railway. In the past two years, Soviet experts have selflessly trained more than 16,000 management cadres and technicians for us. National famous railway labor models such as Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, Yang Maolin, and female driver Tian Guiying were all personally trained by Soviet experts. Soviet experts selflessly introduced the advanced experience of Soviet railways to us. This railway has promoted more than 130 kinds of advanced Soviet work methods in the past two years, and has also created many advanced work methods in combination with Chinese experience, playing a leading and exemplary role in the national railway system, greatly promoting the development of China's railway construction industry. Now that the railway has been well constructed, and talents have also been trained, the Soviet Union is transferring this jointly managed railway to us free of charge. This kind of sincere and selfless friendship is truly unprecedented in human history.
    The Great Force for Defending Peace
    Article 1 of the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance" signed on February 14, 1950, stipulates that China and the Soviet Union both "guarantee to jointly exert all necessary measures to prevent the re-aggression and destruction of peace by Japan or any other state directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in aggressive actions." Now it is very clear how important this provision is. Facts have proved that U.S. imperialism is constantly trying to invade our country, attack the Soviet Union, and attack all people's democratic countries. In Asia, it is actively reviving Japanese militarism, using Japan as an invasion base, launching the Korean War, and forcibly occupying our country's Taiwan. U.S. planes invading Korea constantly intrude into our country, and are carrying out heinous germ warfare against China and North Korea. The U.S. war-mongers also frequently clamor to bomb our country and expand the Korean War. U.S. imperialism openly violates the Potsdam Proclamation, the Cairo Declaration, and the Allied Far East policy toward Japan, and signed a unilateral "peace treaty with Japan." The reactionary Japanese Yoshida government also concluded some sort of "Japan-China peace treaty" with the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan. The Japanese government still has no intention of concluding a peace treaty with our country or with the Soviet Union. This situation poses a serious threat to world peace, especially to peace in the East. It is only because the forces of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union are incomparably strong that the U.S. imperialist plan to launch a large-scale war of aggression has been frustrated. And among the forces of the world peace camp, the strong alliance of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union is the most important force. Therefore, in order to maintain and consolidate world peace today, we must further strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. It is because of this new situation that our government proposed that the Soviet Union postpone the withdrawal of its troops from the Lushunkou Naval Base until after the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Soviet government fully agreed to this proposal. This shows that the determination of China and the Soviet Union to jointly prevent aggression is firm. The friendly cooperation between the two countries is unbreakable. This measure of China and the Soviet Union deals a heavy blow to the war policy of U.S. imperialism and has great significance for defending peace in the East and the world. We remember that during the Sino-Japanese "Jiawu" War in 1894, the Japanese army landed in our country from the Lushunkou area. After 1904, Japan occupied the Lushun-Dalian area for 41 years. This place became the bridgehead for Japan's invasion of Northeast China. Such an important strategic naval port being jointly defended by China and the Soviet Union is a great guarantee for the security of our country. At present, we are on the eve of launching large-scale economic construction work, and our ally the Soviet Union is selflessly with us to prevent aggression and defend peace. In addition to being grateful for this friendship of the Soviet Union, we should also step up our national defense construction and economic construction, strengthen our unity with the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries, and with all peace-loving people in the world, so that the forces defending world peace will be more consolidated and stronger.

### 发展中苏友谊、保卫东方与世界和平

专栏：宣传员讲话

    发展中苏友谊、保卫东方与世界和平
    最近，由周恩来总理兼外交部长率领的我国政府代表团到莫斯科和苏联政府举行了会谈。斯大林大元帅亲自参加了这个会谈。九月十五日，中苏两国政府发表了这次会谈的公报，公报指出：双方已经讨论了有关中苏两国关系的重要政治和经济问题；公报同时公布了两个文件。一个是关于中国长春铁路的公告。公告规定：苏联政府把两国共同管理中国长春铁路的一切权利以及附属于这条铁路的全部财产，无偿地移交我国政府，完全归我国政府所有。两国政府已经协议成立一个中苏联合委员会，着手进行工作，以便于今年年底以前把中长铁路移交完毕。
    另一个文件是两国外交部长关于旅顺口海军根据地的换文。周恩来外长的去文，向苏联政府提议，为保障和平起见，并根据中苏友好同盟互助条约，把一九五○年二月十四日中苏关于旅顺口的协定中所规定的苏联军队从共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退的期限予以延长，直到我国和日本，苏联和日本订立了和约时为止。维辛斯基外长复文表示同意。
    上述的文件一方面说明中苏两国的友好合作完全是真诚无私的。两国的友谊进一步巩固和发展了。另一方面说明，中苏两国都努力用一切办法来维护与巩固和平。这就使远东和世界和平有了有力的保障。
        中苏友谊的巩固和发展大家知道，苏联对中国人民的友好合作一贯是真诚无私的。远在三十多年前，苏联十月革命胜利后不久的时候，苏联政府就自动宣告废除帝俄和中国以及其他弱小民族所签订的一切不平等条约，放弃帝俄在中国的一切特权。我国第一次国内革命时期，苏联又给予了极大的援助。抗日战争一开始，苏联立刻用大量的人力、物力来帮助中国抗日，并且和中国订立了互不侵犯条约。一九四五年八月，苏联又和当时的中国政府订立了“中苏友好同盟条约”。苏联根据这个条约，出兵东北，歼灭了日本帝国主义的主力——关东军，迫使日本投降。当时，苏联为了对日作战的便利并防止日本侵略的再起，又和中国签订协定，规定在三十年内，中苏两国共同管理中长铁路；又规定旅顺口海军根据地在三十年内由苏联负责防卫、中苏两国共同使用，民事行政则仍属于中国。一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国成立，远东的形势起了根本的变化。中国人民自己掌握了国家政权。中苏两国人民的友好合作不再受反动派的破坏了。从此中苏友谊进入了一个崭新的时代。一九五○年二月十四日，两国签订了伟大的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”；同时签订了关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定，规定一俟对日和约签订后，但不迟于一九五二年末，苏联即将共同管理的中长铁路移交我国，苏联军队即自共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤退。当时，刘少奇副主席告诉我们：“这个条约及其他协定的签订，使我们中国有了自己的在历史上从来没有过的伟大的同盟国，从而就巩固了中国人民已经取得的胜利，使中国被破坏很严重的人民经济将很快地恢复与发展起来，同时，也极大地加强了以苏联为首的世界和平、民主与社会主义的力量，因而增加了远东和平与世界普遍安全的保障。”（一九五○年二月十五日庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订时的讲演）两年多的事实，完全证实了刘少奇副主席的话。中苏两国牢不可破的友谊，空前地巩固、发展了。据今年九月份的不完全统计，全国加入中苏友好协会的人数已达三千八百多万。各级地方和各地工厂、农村、机关、学校中，已组织了中苏友好协会的分支会十二万个以上。全国人民中间已经形成了一种加强中苏友谊和向苏联学习的空前高涨的热潮。
    在苏联方面，我们看到，在历次的国际斗争中，在我国的经济、文化建设的各个方面，苏联都给了我们以真诚无私的帮助。年青的新中国能够迅速地医好战争创伤，恢复生产，并使国家财政经济情况根本好转，国防巩固，国际地位空前提高，是和苏联的真诚援助分不开的。就拿中长铁路来说吧。这条铁道包括两条巨大的干线（一条从满洲里经哈尔滨到绥芬河；另一条由哈尔滨到大连），全路通车线路有三千多公里。日本撤退时曾遭受严重的破坏。在中苏共管的几年中，苏联以大量的人力、物力来帮助我们修补和建设这条铁路，把它建设成了模范铁路。在过去的两年中，苏联专家以忘我的精神为我们培养了一万六千多名管理干部和技术工人。像全国著名的铁路劳动模范郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林，女司机田桂英等，都是苏联专家亲手培养出来的。苏联专家们无私地把苏联铁路的先进经验介绍给我们。这条铁路两年中推广了苏联先进工作方法一百三十多种，又结合中国经验创造了许多先进工作方法，在全国铁路中起了带头示范的作用，大大地推动了我国的铁路建设事业。现在铁路建设好了，人材也培养出来了，苏联又把两国共管的这条铁路无偿地移交我国。这种真诚无私的友情，真是人类历史上所从来没有过的。
    保卫和平的伟大力量
    一九五○年二月十四日签订的“中苏友好同盟互助条约”中，第一条就规定了中苏两国都“保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平”。现在看得很明显，这种规定是如何的重要。事实证明，美帝国主义无时无刻不在想侵略我国、进攻苏联和各人民民主国家。在亚洲，它积极复活日本的军国主义，以日本为侵略基地，发动了朝鲜战争，强占了我国的台湾。侵朝的美国飞机不断地侵入我国，而且向中朝两国进行万恶的细菌战。美国的战争贩子们还时常嚷着要轰炸我国，扩大朝鲜战争。美帝国主义公然破坏波茨坦公告、开罗宣言和远东盟国的对日政策，签订了片面的“对日和约”。反动的日本吉田政府还和台湾的国民党匪帮残余集团订立了什么“日华和约”。日本政府至今还没有和我国、和苏联订立和约的意愿。这种形势，使世界和平，特别是东方的和平受到了严重的威胁。仅仅是因为以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量无比强大，才使美帝国主义发动大规模侵略战争的计划受到了挫折。而在世界和平阵营的力量中，中苏两国七万万人民的强固同盟是最主要的力量。所以，今天要维护和巩固世界和平，就必须进一步加强中苏两国的友好合作。就是因为出现了这种新的情况，所以我国政府提议苏联在旅顺口海军根据地的军队延期到对日和约签订以后再撤退。苏联政府完全同意这个提议。这说明中苏两国共同防止侵略的决心是坚定的。两国的友好合作是牢不可破的。中苏两国的这项措施，给美帝国主义的战争政策以严重的打击，对保卫东方与世界和平有着极大的意义。我们记得，一八九四年的中日“甲午”战争中，日本军队就曾经从旅顺口地区登陆进攻我国。一九○四年以后，日本占据旅大地区达四十一年之久。这里曾成为日本侵略我国东北的桥头堡垒。这样一个重要的战略军港由中苏两国来共同防守，这对我国的安全是一个很大的保障。目前，我们正处在开展大规模经济建设工作的前夕，我们的盟国苏联无私地和我们在一起防止侵略、保卫和平，我们除了感激苏联的这种友情之外，更应该加紧我们的国防建设和经济建设，加强我们和苏联与各人民民主国家以及全世界一切爱好和平的人们的团结，使保卫世界和平的力量更加巩固、更加强大。
