    The social labor organization of serfdom is maintained by the discipline of the stick... The social labor organization of capitalism is maintained by the discipline of hunger... The social labor organization of communism (with socialism as its initial form) is maintained by the free and conscious discipline of the laboring masses themselves, who have overthrown both the oppression of the landlords and the oppression of the capitalists, and the further we go, the more we must rely on this discipline." (Lenin: "A Great Beginning")

    The glorious facts of the three years since the founding of the country are proof of the free and conscious discipline of the Chinese working class and all working people. It is precisely because the working class and the laboring people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, have highly developed their enthusiasm and creativity, and have learned and are learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, that they have created many great achievements in just three short years: domestically, they have achieved a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, preparing the foundation and conditions for large-scale economic construction; on the Korean battlefield, they have achieved a great victory, shattering the conspiracy of US imperialism to expand its war of aggression. In this way, our Chinese working class and laboring people are building and defending our great motherland and a happy future.

    Let us take a brief look at the heroic posture of the working class on the production front over the past three years. In the second year after the national liberation—1950—more than 683,000 workers participated in labor emulation drives; in 1951, 2,380,000 people participated in the drives; in the first half of 1952, after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, more than 80 percent of all employees participated in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. Over the past three years, the masses of employees have created many advanced experiences in improving machinery, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization, and have put forward many rationalization proposals. In the past three years, the masses of employees have put forward nearly 400,000 rationalization proposals, of which more than 241,000 have been adopted. Due to the high degree of production enthusiasm and creativity of workers across the country, labor productivity has been greatly improved. In 1951, the labor productivity of workers in Northeast China exceeded the highest level before liberation by 42 percent, and in the first half of 1952, it exceeded the same period in 1951 by 20.9 percent. Taking coal mine production as an example, labor productivity has increased by 88 percent compared with the period before liberation. In this heroic cause, a large number of model figures have emerged. According to the statistics of 1951, we already have more than 86,500 labor models. From these few figures alone, we can already see the heroic posture of the Chinese working class on the production front. This heroic posture is a miracle in the eyes of those who have always looked down on the working masses. Why can the ability and wisdom of the working class be fully developed? Because in the new China after liberation, the working class has become the leading class of the country, and the interests of the country are completely consistent with the interests of the working class itself. In the process of production development, the material and cultural life of the working class has been greatly improved and is still being continuously improved. The working class fully understands their position in the new China from their own lives, understands the relationship between their own interests and the interests of the country, and therefore has a high sense of responsibility for the interests of the country and the development of production. This is the class consciousness and political awareness of the working class, and this is the deep source of strength.

    Let us take a look at the political status and living conditions of the working class in New China. Not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China, on February 28, 1950, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued instructions on the establishment of factory management committees in state-owned and public-owned factories, stipulating that workers could elect representatives in the same number as the enterprise administration to form factory management committees to participate in factory management. On June 29, 1950, the Central People's Government promulgated the Trade Union Law, clearly stipulating the legal status and responsibilities of the working class's mass organization—the trade union—under the new democratic state power, and guaranteeing the fundamental interests of the working class with state laws. In 1951, the Labor Insurance Regulations were promulgated, which initially resolved the problems of birth, old age, sickness, death, injury, and disability of the working masses. Of course, in addition to these state laws, there are many regulations, decisions, and instructions that protect the interests of the working class in all aspects. All measures of the People's Government reflect the nature of our state power—the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance.

    All the policies and laws of our country are by no means just staying on paper. From the day we took over the bureaucratic enterprises, we have been restoring production on the one hand and destroying the reactionary, feudal, and unreasonable systems that oppress the working masses on the other. Especially in the past two years, all state-owned industrial and mining enterprises have systematically carried out democratic reforms, purged counter-revolutionary elements, cleared away all dirty systems, and established new democratic systems. This enterprise reform work, which has great historical significance, has been basically completed nationwide after the "Three-Anti" movement, and the working class has truly become the master of the enterprise.

    The status of the working masses employed in private enterprises is also fundamentally different from that before liberation. The political rights and legitimate economic interests of the working class are fully guaranteed. Capitalists' oppression of workers and illegal exploitation of workers are criminal acts, which are not allowed by state laws. Capitalists' business operations are carried out under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and are limited to the scope permitted by the Common Program and beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is precisely because of this that the working masses of private enterprises have also adopted a responsible attitude towards production and management. On the one hand, they actively develop production and management, and on the other hand, they resolutely protect their own interests and the interests of the country, and oppose the illegal acts of capitalists. This is the attitude adopted and being adopted by the working masses of private enterprises and their own organizations—trade unions.

    Obviously, over the past three years, the reform of private enterprises has lagged behind that of state-owned enterprises. In many private enterprises, many illegal systems are still retained by capitalists. After the great "Five-Anti" movement, this situation has undergone a fundamental change. Through the "Five-Anti" movement, the attacks of illegal bourgeois elements were fully exposed and repelled, the working masses were widely and deeply mobilized and educated, the boundary between the working class and the bourgeoisie was clarified, and the organizational strength of the working class was further strengthened, thereby strengthening the working class's supervision of the bourgeoisie and ensuring that state laws and policies are not violated.

    In terms of the material life of the working class, over the past three years, with the recovery and development of production, there has also been a significant improvement. The average wage of workers across the country is now 60 to 120 percent higher than in 1949. In the Northeast region alone, more than 2.6 million square meters of workers' housing have been built; the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government plans to solve all the workers' housing problems within three to five years, and this plan has already begun to be implemented this year. The special difficulties of female workers have also been appropriately taken care of. In addition to the 56-day leave stipulated before and after childbirth, there are a total of more than 1,600 nurseries for workers across the country. Larger factories have breastfeeding rooms. A total of 3,020,000 employees enjoy the benefits of the Labor Insurance Regulations, including family members, totaling about 10,000,000 people. There are now 37 workers' sanatoriums, 14 homes for the disabled and elderly, and 3 orphanages across the country. Facilities such as after-work rest homes, sanatorium rooms, and nutritious canteens are even more common. Due to these measures, the health of employees has made great progress.

    The progress of the cultural life of the working class in the past three years is also considerable. There are about 8,900 spare-time schools for employees across the country, with a total of 3,020,000 workers participating in the study. There are 66 cultural palaces and clubs and more than 5,100 libraries on a larger scale nationwide. According to statistics at the end of June this year, more than 26,400 workers have been released from production to study technology.

    All of these clearly show that as production develops, the life of the working class also improves; as production continues to develop, the life of the working class will inevitably continue to improve, and the interests of the working class and the interests of the country are completely consistent. This consistency is a manifestation of the superiority of our national system. Under our new democratic national system, the ability and wisdom of the working class can be fully developed, and the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class are endless. This is the most valuable and important foundation for our construction cause. With such a foundation, we will surely victoriously move towards industrialization and socialism.

    Now, after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and before the country's large-scale economic construction, the working class across the country, under the call of Chairman Mao, is carrying out a patriotic production increase and economy campaign. This competition is different from previous competitions. It is launched on the basis of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and is a direct preparation for large-scale economic construction. The "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, from the perspective of the employee movement, are an epoch-making movement. It ended the period of political reform of enterprises and began the period of production and construction. After the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the employee movement must effectively turn to production, and therefore must go deep into work, solve various specific problems in production and employee life, and accumulate various experiences in production and construction, which is also to prepare the foundation and conditions for large-scale economic construction. Our production increase and economy campaign is moving towards this goal. The broad masses of employees are welcoming the arrival of the period of large-scale economic construction with such actions.

    Of course, there are still many, even serious, shortcomings in the production increase and economy campaign, but these shortcomings do not mainly come from the masses of employees. On the contrary, these shortcomings are due to the fact that the leadership of enterprises lags behind the masses. In the production increase and economy campaign, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of employees are generally high, and many achievements have been made, and therefore many new problems have been raised. However, many leading cadres of enterprises lack experience and show a certain degree of passivity in the face of many new problems, and cannot solve these problems in a timely and appropriate manner, so many shortcomings have arisen in the production increase and economy campaign. These shortcomings are shortcomings in the process of advancement, and after a period of in-depth and meticulous work, they will soon get on the right track.

    This year's National Day is a National Day before our great motherland is about to enter a period of large-scale economic construction. In the upcoming large-scale economic construction, the Chinese working class will show its strength even more. The working class will work with other working people across the country, and stand at the forefront of the working people, to build our own great motherland with their own hands and create their own happy life.

    Around this year's National Day, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be held in our capital. This is the glory of the Chinese people, the glory of the Chinese working class. The Chinese working class wholeheartedly supports this conference and is determined to faithfully implement all the resolutions of the conference and contribute its strength to defending peace in the Far East and world peace.

    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, great China is about to enter a great construction period. "Striving for the industrialization of the country" is the concentrated will of the Chinese working class. The socialist prospect has taken root in the hearts of every Chinese worker, and they are bravely and confidently moving forward.

    大规模经济建设前夜的中国工人阶级
    ——纪念第三届国庆节
    中华全国总工会秘书长  赖若愚
    “农奴制的社会劳动组织是靠棍棒纪律来维持的，……。资本主义的社会劳动组织是靠饥饿纪律来维持的，……。共产主义（其初步为社会主义）的社会劳动组织，则是靠那些既推翻了地主压迫，又推翻了资本家压迫的劳动群众本身底自由自觉纪律来维持的，而且愈往前去，便愈要靠这种纪律来维持。”（列宁：伟大的创举）
    开国三年以来的光辉事实，就是中国工人阶级和全体劳动人民自由自觉纪律的证明。正是由于工人阶级和劳动人民，在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导之下，高度地发挥了积极性和创造性，学习了和学习着苏联的先进经验，所以在短短的三年当中，便创造了许多伟大的业绩：在国内，取得了财政经济状况的根本好转，为大规模的经济建设准备了基础和条件；在朝鲜战场上，取得了伟大的胜利，打破了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋。就是这样，我们中国工人阶级和劳动人民缔造着并且保卫着我们伟大的祖国和幸福的未来。
    让我们略为看看工人阶级三年来在生产战线上的英雄姿态吧。全国解放的第二年——一九五零年，有六十八万三千多工人参加了劳动竞赛；一九五一年就有二百三十八万人参加了竞赛；一九五二年上半年，“三反”、“五反”运动后参加爱国增产节约竞赛运动的占全体职工百分之八十以上。三年以来，职工群众对于改进机器、改进操作方法、改进劳动组织等各方面，创造了很多先进经验，提出了很多合理化建议。三年来职工群众所提的合理化建议近四十万件，其中已被采纳的有二十四万一千多件。由于全国工人高度发挥了生产积极性和创造性，使劳动生产率大大提高。东北工人在一九五一年的劳动生产率已超过解放前最高水平百分之四十二，一九五二年上半年又比一九五一年同期超过百分之二十点九。以煤矿生产为例，劳动生产率比解放前提高了百分之八十八。在这样的英雄事业中间，涌现出大批的模范人物，据一九五一年的统计，我们已经有了八万六千五百多位劳动模范。仅仅从这几个数目字，我们已经可以看到中国工人阶级在生产战线上的英雄姿态。这种英雄姿态，在那些从来看不起工人群众的人们的眼睛里是一种奇迹。为什么工人阶级的能力和智慧能够得到充分的发挥呢？因为在解放以后的新中国，工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级，国家的利益和工人阶级自己的利益完全一致。在生产发展的过程中，工人阶级的物质生活和文化生活已经得了很大的改善，并且还在不断地继续改善着。工人阶级从自身的生活中完全懂得他们在新中国的地位，懂得自己的利益和国家利益的关系，因而对于国家的利益、对于生产事业的发展具有高度的责任感。这便是工人阶级的阶级觉悟和政治觉悟，这便是力量的深厚源泉。
    让我们看一看新中国工人阶级的政治地位和生活状况吧。中华人民共和国开国不久，一九五零年二月二十八日，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会就颁布了关于国营、公营工厂建立工厂管理委员会的指示，规定工人可以选举与企业行政同等数量的代表，组成工厂管理委员会，参加工厂管理。一九五零年六月二十九日，中央人民政府颁布了工会法，明确地规定了工人阶级的群众组织——工会在新民主主义国家政权下的法律地位与职责，以国家法令来保障了工人阶级的根本利益。一九五一年又颁布了劳动保险条例，使工人群众的生、老、病、死、伤、残等问题，得到了初步的解决。当然，除了这些国家法令之外，还有许多条例、决定和指示，从各个方面保护着工人阶级的利益。人民政府的一切措施，都反映了我们国家政权的性质——工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政。
    我们国家的一切政策法令决不是停留在纸上的。从我们接管了官僚企业的那一天起，就在一方面恢复生产，一方面摧毁那些压迫工人群众的反动的封建的不合理的制度。特别在两年以来，所有的国营工矿企业，都系统地进行了民主改革，清除了反革命分子，清除了一切肮脏的制度，建立了新的民主制度。这一具有伟大历史意义的企业改革工作，经过了“三反”运动，在全国范围内基本上完成了，工人阶级名符其实地成了企业的主人。
    就是在私营企业受雇的工人群众的地位，也和解放前有了根本的区别。工人阶级的政治权利和正当的经济利益，都有充分的保障。资本家压迫工人和非法剥削工人的行为都是犯罪行为，是国家法令所不容许的。资本家的营业是在国营经济领导之下进行的，是限制在共同纲领所许可的、对国计民生有利的范围之内的。也正因为如此，所以私营企业的工人群众，对于生产和经营，也是采取了负责态度的。一方面积极地发展生产和经营，一方面坚决保护自己的和国家的利益，反对资本家的非法行为，这便是私营企业的工人群众及其自己的组织——工会所采取了和采取着的态度。
    显然的，三年以来，私营企业的改革是落在国营企业后边的。在很多私营企业里，许多不合法的制度还被资本家保留着。经过了伟大的“五反”运动，这种情况才起了根本的变化。经过“五反”运动，充分揭发了并打退了不法资产阶级分子的进攻，普遍而深刻地发动与教育了工人群众，划清了工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，进一步加强了工人阶级的组织力量，从而也就加强了工人阶级对资产阶级的监督，保障了国家的法令政策不被违背。
    从工人阶级的物质生活来说，三年以来，随着生产的恢复与发展，也有了显著的改善。现在全国工人的平均工资，比一九四九年增加了百分之六十至一百二十。工人的住宅，仅东北一个地区，已经建筑了二百六十余万平方公尺；中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会计划在三、五年之内，解决工人的全部住宅问题，今年已经开始实行了这一计划。女工的特殊困难也得到了适当的照顾，除了产前产后规定了五十六天的假期之外，全国为工人所办的托儿所共有一千六百余个。较大的工厂都有哺乳室的设备。全国享受劳动保险条例待遇的职工有三百零二万人，连家属在内，共约一千余万人。现在全国已经有工人疗养院三十七个，残废养老院十四个，孤儿院三个，至于业余休养所、疗养室、营养食堂等设施，更是相当普遍的。由于这些措施，职工的健康状况已经有了长足的进步。
    工人阶级的文化生活，三年来的进步也是可观的。职工业余学校全国约有八千九百余个，参加学习的工人共有三百零二万人。全国规模较大的文化宫和俱乐部六十六个，图书馆五千一百多个。脱离生产学习技术的工人，据今年六月底的统计，已达二万六千四百多人。
    所有这些，都清楚地说明：生产发展了，工人阶级的生活也随着改善了；生产继续发展，工人阶级生活必将继续提高，工人阶级的利益和国家的利益是完全一致的。这种一致，正是我们国家制度的优越性的表现。在我们新民主主义的国家制度之下，工人阶级的能力与智慧能够得到充分的发挥，工人阶级的积极性、创造性是无穷无尽的，这就是我们建设事业最宝贵最重要的基础。有了这样的基础，我们必将胜利地走向工业化，走向社会主义。
    现在，在伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动之后，在国家大规模经济建设之前，全国工人阶级，在毛主席的号召之下，正在开展着爱国主义的增产节约竞赛。这次竞赛不同于已往的历次竞赛，它是在
    “三反”、“五反”运动的基础上开展起来的，是大规模经济建设的直接准备。“三反”、“五反”运动，从职工运动的角度来说，是一次划时期的运动。它结束了企业的政治改革时期，开始了生产建设时期。在“三反”、“五反”运动之后，职工运动必须切实转向生产，因而也必须深入工作，解决生产中和职工生活中的各种具体问题，蓄积生产建设的各种经验，这也正是为大规模的经济建设准备基础和条件。我们的增产节约竞赛运动，正在向着这个目标前进。广大的职工群众，就是以这样的行动迎接国家大规模经济建设时期的到来。
    当然，在增产节约竞赛运动中，还存在着许多的甚至是严重的缺点，可是这些缺点主要的并不是从职工群众来的，相反地，这些缺点的产生，乃是由于企业的领导落后于群众。在增产节约竞赛中，职工群众的积极性、创造性普遍昂扬，也取得了很多成绩，因而也就提出了许多新的问题。可是许多企业的领导干部经验不足，在许多新问题的面前表现某种程度的被动，不能及时地恰当地解决这些问题，所以在增产节约竞赛中就产生了许多缺点。这些缺点是前进中的缺点，经过一段深入细致的工作，就会很快地走上正轨。
    今年的国庆节，是我们伟大祖国即将进入大规模经济建设之前的一个国庆节。在即将到来的大规模经济建设当中，中国工人阶级将要更加显示自己的力量，工人阶级将与全国其他劳动人民一道，并站在劳动人民的最前列，以自己的双手建设我们自己的伟大祖国，缔造自己的幸福生活。
    今年的国庆节前后，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将在我们首都召开。这是我们中国人民的光荣，是中国工人阶级的光荣，中国工人阶级竭诚拥护这次会议，并决心忠实地执行会议的一切决议，为保卫远东和平与世界和平贡献自己的力量。
    在毛主席和共产党的英明领导下，伟大的中国即将进入伟大的建设时期。“为国家工业化而奋斗”，这便是中国工人阶级集中的意志。社会主义的远景已经在每一个中国工人的心中生了根，他们正在勇敢地、满怀信心地向前迈进。
