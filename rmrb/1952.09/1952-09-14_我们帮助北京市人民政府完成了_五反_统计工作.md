    We Helped the Beijing Municipal People's Government Complete the "Five-Anti" Statistics Work

    To the Editor: We are students from the finance and economics school's statistics training class. This April, the higher authorities transferred us to various districts in Beijing to do "Five-Anti" statistics work. Initially, we were unfamiliar with this work and found it difficult. However, we were determined to overcome the difficulties, actively strive, and find the tricks of the trade in our work. Some comrades created the "folding" and "point counting" calculation methods for statistical tables, which greatly improved work efficiency. In order to quickly complete the task, we demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and reduced rest time, finally successfully completing the statistical work for the Beijing "Five-Anti" campaign.

    From this work, we deeply experienced that: no matter what work we do, as long as we actively study and use our brains, difficulties can be completely overcome.

    我们帮助北京市人民政府完成了“五反”统计工作
    编辑同志：我们是财经学校统计训练班的学生。今年四月间，上级把我们调到北京市各区去作“五反”统计工作。最初，我们对这一工作都很生疏，感到很难作。但是我们有决心克服困难，积极努力，寻找工作中的窍门。有的同志创造了统计表的“折叠”、“计点”计算法，大大提高了工作效率。我们为了迅速完成任务，发扬了高度的积极性，减少休息时间，终于胜利地完成了北京市“五反”的统计工作。
    从这次工作中，我们深深体验到：不管作任何工作，只要积极钻研，开动脑筋，困难是完全可以克服的。
