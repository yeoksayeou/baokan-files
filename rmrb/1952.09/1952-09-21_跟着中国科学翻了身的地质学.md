Geology, Transformed by Chinese Science
Li Siguang

(I)
Nearly eight hundred years ago, several ancient Chinese scholars, such as Shen Kuo and Zhu Xi, had already initiated the indication that certain natural phenomena marked geological historical evolution. The significant contributions made by these two great scientists and philosophers in recognizing geological phenomena are related to laying the basic principles of geological science. The era in which they discussed geological phenomena was more than two hundred years before the birth of the Western geological pioneer, the famous Italian Leonardo da Vinci. Due to the unfavorable political and harmful social conditions at the time, this nascent science was strangled shortly after its birth.

Modern Chinese geological workers have participated in geological surveys, research, and general discussions of geological science issues in their motherland for only about forty years. During these forty years, they have made many contributions and achieved certain scientific accomplishments, but they also have many shortcomings. These shortcomings, in addition to the lingering bourgeois consciousness of many geological scientists, are also due to the influence of the conservatism and reaction of bourgeois ideology in their thinking methods. In their work, they mostly tend to stick to conventions, unwilling to discard outdated things, and not easily accepting new creations, which delays the progress of science. Secondly, the philosophy touted by the bourgeoisie is often various forms of idealism (including subjective idealism and objective idealism) or mechanical materialism. Going to do scientific work under the guidance of this metaphysical (in the sense that Engels spoke of) basic philosophical thought, ultimately, will inevitably lead to unscientific conclusions that are divorced from reality, or agnosticism and pessimism. In the past, the reason why our Chinese geological workers were so easily influenced by the thinking of their counterparts in capitalist countries was partly because geological science developed later in modern China, and many of us had studied in those countries; therefore, we unconsciously brought back whatever they were doing, whether good or bad, and continued to import them into our motherland through their publications or personal relationships.

But there is an even more important reason. That is due to the imperialist aggression and the colonial mentality in our country in the past that directly caused it. We say that the political nature of geological science is particularly strong compared to other sciences, and this is a concrete manifestation: One of the main purposes of imperialists opening up colonies is to plunder the underground resources of the other party. The first step in this regard is to secretly understand our country's geological conditions. In order to cover up this conspiracy, they very cleverly advocated the so-called "science has no borders" high-sounding tune in advance. Does science need international cooperation? It is needed. But we must remember: The basic conditions for international cooperation must be that both parties have independence, autonomy, equality, and freedom. Talking about cooperation without allowing the other party to be independent and autonomous, without talking about equality with them, and without giving them freedom, that is to enslave the other party and make them surrender. In the realm of scientific undertakings, this measure of implementing enslavement is manifested in both economic aggression and cultural aggression. The method of cultural aggression is exactly the outer garment that covers up economic aggression. This is especially evident in geological undertakings. In addition, academic discussions and teacher-student relationships happen to suit the tastes of the remaining feudal ideas in China. Imperialist aggressors thus combined with the large and small feudal groups in our country in the past, forming and exacerbating the rampant sectarianism. Our scientific community has generally been dominated and corrupted by it. It should be pointed out here: the geological community may be particularly severe.

Under the above circumstances, a general worship of foreign ideas arose. Our domestic geological workers worked even harder to seize opportunities to publish geological data collected domestically in foreign publications, or to seize opportunities to write more important papers in foreign languages and publish them domestically. Our geological workers, especially the older generation of geological workers, including the author, when we examine our own past today, how many people can not painfully confess that we have committed this serious mistake? In this way, not only is our scientific work divorced from the broad masses of the people in our country, but also scientific workers themselves lose the necessary self-confidence. The result is that we tend not to use the large amount of fresh data we have discovered domestically to establish a sounder foundation for Chinese geology and solve the various practical problems we encounter, but instead to force this large amount of facts to fit some outdated or narrowly-minded theories from abroad. This not only hinders our solution to the urgent problems we face, but also hinders the progress of the entire geological science. For example, we have half a continent's tectonic pattern vividly displayed before our eyes, giving us a unique opportunity to engage in detailed investigation and analysis, and independently draw our conclusions; why should we force some structural situations or certain theories that may not be correct related to the Alps or the Appalachian Mountains as a framework to apply to it? Is it necessary to explain the composition of the Great Wall of China by the method of building the Eiffel Tower? This is unreasonable.

(II)
The geological work of the old era had certain achievements. But this does not mean that creating more bizarre names like "jaggapitte" (mainly ultrabasic rocks composed of pyroxene and ilmenite), or using more exotic Latin and Greek words that people do not understand, counts as an achievement. If this is considered an achievement, then it is worse than comparing science to the eight-legged essay. Our achievements are mainly that we have collected many facts about Chinese geology and left many records describing the facts. Although geological workers in capitalist countries, especially British and American geological workers, either ignore our achievements or accept them with reservations, and although we have not done enough in our efforts to determine the facts, this large pile of factual records, as long as they are correct, are all extremely scientifically valuable data.

But we should also point out without any taboo that in our past records, we can often find some more common shortcomings. such as:
(1) The attitude towards the correctness of the records, including the identification of minerals, rocks, paleobiological and other species, is not serious enough.
(2) Regarding certain basic facts, such as: the various characteristics of local strata and the comparison of their classifications and stratigraphic positions, the steps of surveying and mapping the shape of igneous rock bodies and their final identification, the steps and basis for identifying various structural components (such as the various evidences necessary to determine a fault), etc., they are either not listed in detail or glossed over. These inevitably cause a serious geological worker to doubt the value of those records.
(3) When making conclusions, the attitude is often ambiguous. No affirmative or negative decision is made on the solution of the problem, even a preliminary solution. The facts obtained from observation are not analyzed, or the analysis is not detailed enough; there is a lack of effort to point out the core of the problem.
(4) The past relevant work is only briefly described in one sentence—if it is mentioned at all—and rarely is it appropriately criticized from the newly discovered facts or any correct reasons for the new discovery. Conversely, if there is criticism of the work of others in the past, it often inevitably exposes a rough, contemptuous, or indifferent attitude. It is really not too much to want to find humble, friendly, meticulous, kind and rigorous criticism in our past literature. Due to the lack of such correct criticism, we can find that the staff who have investigated and researched in the same area several times before and after often disagree on the reserves of the same mineral deposit, the structural conditions of the same area, and many other major issues in the same area, turning back and forth and being unable to reach a consensus. It is generally believed that the opinions of the people who participated in the work for the last time are more correct, but this is not necessarily reliable.

We have initially reviewed the past and have already discovered such situations. Of course, there are more shortcomings that deserve more rigorous examination and criticism. Everyone knows that this work of examination and criticism is the first step on our road to self-education and self-transformation. The broad road is in front of us, but taking the first step depends on our own efforts. What makes us happy and encouraged is that since liberation, our geological workers, under the leadership of our ideological mentor Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, have carried out a series of revolutionary struggles aimed at the above-mentioned shortcomings, and have won many gains. Our gains are not simply expressed in a pile of business reports and beautiful papers as in the past, but have achieved great victories in solving some basic problems. In short, first of all, we have recognized the correct working direction and method: science must serve the people, and science must be the cause of the masses. This is the urgent requirement of our people who have turned over for science; this is also the necessary condition to ensure that the direction of scientific development is correct and its content is rich. Under the guidance of such clear ideas, combined with practical work, and through continuous learning, especially after the victorious completion of the great "Three-Anti" movement and ideological reform studies, we have defeated the sectarianism and the combination of individual small groups left over from the past reactionary ruling era; criticized bad styles such as personal heroism and purely technical viewpoints; and learned to keep state secrets and abandoned the erroneous concept of keeping technical secrets for individuals. We have begun to understand how to face the people and the masses, we have begun to recognize the significance and superiority of collective work, and we have also recognized the greatness of the power of the masses and the endless source of the wisdom of the masses.

Under the current world situation and our own existing material conditions, in order to build our new country, we deeply realize that we must first use all our strength to develop our underground resources and engage in economic construction and national defense construction. In the past, during the reactionary rule, some of our geological workers lacked enthusiasm for the investigation and research of underground resources, partly because they not only saw that the motherland did not have that need at that time, but also realized that they were serving at least indirectly those who opened up colonies. Today the situation is completely different. Discovering one and a half pounds of useful things from the underground means increasing wealth for the people and creating conditions for national industrialization. Not only that, Chairman Mao once instructed: "With the advent of the upsurge of economic construction, an upsurge of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Therefore, our scientists do not have to worry that using all their strength in economic development will not only have a bad impact on the development of science itself, but will also greatly improve the level of science.

In the past, because our geological workers did not have a correct understanding of the direction and methods of work, many field workers had such experience: When we hit a stone with a hammer in the field, the farmer standing next to him would hurriedly ask: "What are you doing?" "What is the use of this stone?" We sometimes ridiculed the farmers for asking such questions, and dealt with them in a very improper manner with nonsense. We simply did not realize the seriousness and guiding significance of this question at the time. We should seriously examine: Is there enough reason to hit that stone at that location without asking for the support of the people?

When we explain to the farmers that this stone is a Triassic rock (the Triassic is the name of an era in the world 180 to 90 million years ago), and explain that from the rocks formed in that era, we will have the possibility of discovering several kinds of valuable salts, then, we will not only be able to get the support of the people, but also be able to mobilize the broad masses to collect a large number of similar or seemingly similar specimens to discover more useful things. In fact, the information on the location of mineral deposits and even rare minerals and rare fossils is often provided by the masses. This shows how easy it is for us to seize the opportunity to practice Chairman Mao's instructions when we work in the field.

From such an example, we can understand how to find the direction from the daily work of our geological workers—facing the people, and find the method—combining with the masses, and pushing our scientific undertaking to the broad foundation of the people. If it is said that the combination of theory and practice can be done in this way, it does not seem too much. No one denies that all scientific activities must be carried out under the guidance of theory or hypothesis; no one denies that, regardless of theory and hypothesis, they are more or less the sum and crystallization of known facts. The basis of the hypothesis is certainly not as broad and solid as the basis of the theory, but no matter what theory is inevitably subject to revision as we deepen our understanding of objective things from practice.

(III)
At today's stage of development of geological science, we can say that it is by no means possible to solve problems simply by relying on a few geological workers with hammers and backpacks running around in the field, or by looking at thin sections of rocks and minerals with a spectroscope or a rotating stage. We need a large number of outstanding sister scientists, especially physicists, chemists, and even surveyors and engineers, to work with us or give us guidance before we dare to say that we have some certainty of solving various practical problems. We all know that few practical problems are not complex and do not require the cooperation of experts in many fields to solve. Geological problems are certainly no exception.

In addition, in order to carry out geological surveys and all other related businesses on a large scale, we can also say that this cannot be dealt with by a few administrative staff members. We must establish appropriate institutions and appropriate systems in the form of various "corps" on a broad basis, and carry out tasks in different ways under unified guidance in order to achieve a unified goal.

In order to promote geological work on a large scale under the aforementioned appropriate cooperation and strict organizational form, it is clear that we must have a work plan. On the one hand, it should cooperate with the needs of national economic construction; on the other hand, it should spread out all known data, conduct meticulous inspections and analyses, and determine specific operating plans to meet the requirements of the economic construction plan as much as possible. We must firmly remember that the collectiveness of work is the only way for us to enter socialism, and its planning is a necessary condition for collective work. But it must be pointed out that there is an internal contradiction here: the more accurate the plan, the stronger its performance, but it is inevitably more rigid. The rougher the plan, the weaker its performance will inevitably be, but it is also somewhat convenient to adapt to the environment of development and to adapt to situations that cannot be predetermined in advance. Rigidity and flexibility are contradictory. The only way to solve this contradiction is to carefully consider the degree of reliability of known conditions and the flexibility of the organizational structure in advance, to be able to reflect the objective situation at any time, and to be ready to adjust secondary plans within the scope of the established main plan at any time. In the past two or three years, our geological workers have created certain achievements in their continuous efforts to realize this new working direction and method. The members of various field work teams are no longer facing each other silently or losing their temper as they did in the past, each privately looking for the materials they need to prepare to go home to write reports and papers, but instead report, exchange experience, make suggestions, and draw conclusions through groups on time, and criticize each other in a friendly manner. In addition, we have also made some work plans, selected key points, concentrated our efforts, and promoted practical work according to predetermined steps.

Due to the gradual strengthening of such working methods, we have also gradually, more reliably, increased and revised certain numbers of coal, iron, and several non-ferrous metal reserves (for example: just speaking of coal, the estimated reserves have increased by more than 2.2 billion tons), and have definitively overturned some conclusions made by foreign geological workers who came to China with the mission of opening up colonies about Chinese stratigraphy, structure, paleoclimate, paleogeography, and other issues with carelessness and wildness. These initial achievements are of course still greatly insufficient. In order to meet the high tide of economic construction in our motherland and carry out the exploration of various underground resources on a large scale, our Central People's Government has recently established the Ministry of Geology. Due to its heavy tasks, it is necessary to establish several departments in its organization to handle general administration, personnel (including cadre training), finance, supply, planning and other matters; and several departments to handle matters directly related to business and solve business problems. For example, the data management department includes libraries, exhibition halls, and drilling records and important core samples from all over the country; the surveying and mapping department, the exploration engineering department includes drilling, trenching, tunneling, and geophysical prospecting work; the geological and mineral exploration department, the translation and compilation work department, and the drilling general team, etc. In addition, in order to strengthen ties, the Institute of Geology and the Institute of Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have also decided to be placed under the leadership of the Ministry of Geology in the next few years. The four geological bureaus of Northeast, Northwest, Central South, and Southwest are also led by the Ministry of Geology. In the past, in capitalist countries, there were only small-scale geological institutions to carry out geological work. Only our great socialist neighbor, the Soviet Union, had the establishment of a Ministry of Geology. Because only after the working people have mastered political power can there be the possibility and necessity of developing geological work on a large scale. The experience of the Soviet Union is very rich. We must absorb their experience and obtain their help in order to develop our geological work more rapidly on the road from new democracy to socialism. As for the achievements of geological work in capitalist countries, we should also strictly examine and analyze them with extremely cautious attitudes. If we find anything worthwhile in terms of comparison of data and technology, we should not obliterate everything. Facing such a major task, our team is greatly insufficient in number, so it is necessary to quickly train a large number of young cadres to participate in geological surveys and related work. Recently, after consultation between the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council and the Ministry of Education, it has been decided to establish a Geological College and a Geological Training Course. The former has a term of four years, and the latter has a term of two years. Some people ask: Can staff members with the ability to complete certain tasks be trained during a two-year period? We can say with certainty that it is possible. However, the teaching methods must be improved:
(1) Time must be used very economically during the training period. We must have a thorough arrangement for the content of specialized courses in advance. Advanced and not urgently needed courses must be reduced. Even in each course, teaching materials that are not very practical must be deleted. For example, mineralogy is obviously a necessary subject, but the teaching materials on crystallography should be reduced to the minimum, and ordinary geology is of course also a necessary subject, but the places that overlap with other subjects (such as petrology, structural geology, topography, etc.) must be deleted as much as possible, focusing only on the description of geological phenomena or the programs of various geological changes. As for the use of discipline time, it is not advisable to rigidly implement the "learning-practice ratio" system. When several courses are taught to a certain stage, it is necessary to increase practice and reduce teaching time; and in another stage, it is more advantageous to increase teaching time and reduce practice.
(2) Specialist students must be given certain opportunities for advanced studies, and it is best to have a certain system to guarantee its realization. In this way, the enthusiasm of the students can be improved. Experience tells us that after studying at school once, participating in practical work, and then engaging in more advanced studies, the achievements are often superior.

(IV)
In these great and historic three years, our Chinese geological workers can proudly say: We have initially learned to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, overcome many corrupt habits, and eliminated many outdated things. Today, when the large-scale economic construction of our motherland is about to begin, we can be even more proud to say: Our geological workers are very honored to be selected to participate in the battles at the forefront of the economic front. In order to ensure the victorious completion of this glorious task, each of us must do everything possible to study in order to strengthen our own combat strength. The greatest happiness of people living in the Mao Zedong era is that everyone has the opportunity to study, and there are opportunities to study at all times. We should stand on the ground and learn how to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to solve the practical problems we face in each of our work.

Now, we are all studying Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction." Can we be good at embodying the general truths contained in "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" along the special path of practice of our geological workers, from the shallow to the deep, little by little? This is still a question. However, if we can do this, it will not only guide us to successfully complete the urgent tasks we face, but also guide our geological science to a new and greater development.

Let our geological work comrades unite more closely under the banner of Mao Zedong, move forward more bravely, and strive for greater victories in the construction of our motherland and in the development of geological science.

    跟着中国科学翻了身的地质学
    李四光
    （一）
    将近八百年前中国几位古代学者，如沈括、朱熹已经创始地指出了某些自然现象标志着地质的历史演变。这两位伟大的科学家和哲学家在认识地质现象上所作的重大贡献，都是与奠定地质科学的基本原则有关的。他们谈论地质现象的时代，远在西方的地质学鼻祖，意大利名人达·芬奇出世二百多年以前。由于当时不良的政治和有害的社会条件，这种萌芽的科学，在它降生以后不久便被扼杀了。
    中国近代的地质工作者参加祖国的地质调查、研究以及一般性的地质科学问题的探讨，只不过是近四十年左右的事。在这四十年中，他们有了不少的贡献，也做出了一定的科学的成就，但也有不少的缺点。这些缺点除许多地质科学工作者还残存着资产阶级意识以外，在思想方法上也受了资产阶级思想保守性和反动性的薰染，在业务上大半倾向于墨守陈规，不肯剔除陈腐的东西，不容易接受新的创造，使得科学的进步迟滞。其次，资产阶级所标榜的哲学，常常是各式各样的唯心论（包括主观唯心论客观唯心论），或是机械的唯物论。在这种形而上的（指恩格斯所说的意义）基本哲学思想的指导下去做科学工作，说到究竟，必然导致脱离实际的非科学的结论或不可知论和悲观主义。过去我们中国的地质工作者之所以很容易受到资本主义国家同行人们的思想影响，其理由一部分固然是由于在我们中国近代地质学发展较晚，我们有不少的人曾经到过那些国家去学习；因此，不知不觉地把他们所搞的东西，不管好坏，一起搬回，并且还继续不断地通过他们的刊物，或者个人的关系，把它们输入祖国。
    但是还有更重要的理由。那就是由于帝国主义的侵略活动和我们过去国内殖民地思想所直接造成的。我们说地质科学的政治性比其他科学显得特别强烈，这就是一个具体表现：帝国主义者开辟殖民地的主要目的之一，就是要掠夺对方的地下资源。在这一方面首先的步骤就是偷偷地来了解我国地质情况。他们为了要掩护这种阴谋，很巧妙地预先倡导所谓“科学没有国界”的高调。科学是不是需要国际合作呢？是需要的。但是我们要记着：国际合作的基本条件必须双方都有独立、自主、平等和自由。在一方面不让对方独立自主、不和他讲平等、不让他有自由的条件下来谈合作，那就是要奴役对方，要对方投降。在科学事业的范畴，这种实行奴役的措施，便表现在经济侵略和文化侵略两方面。文化侵略的方式正好做掩护经济侵略的外衣。这一点在地质事业上表现得尤其明显。再加上学院式的讨论和师弟的关系，又正好适合中国残余封建思想的口味。帝国主义侵略者就这样结合着我们国内过去的大小封建集团，形成了并且加剧了宗派主义的猖獗。我们的科学界，一般地受过它的支配和腐蚀。在这里应该指出：地质界也许特别厉害一点。
    在上述情况之下，便产生了一般的崇外思想。我们国内的地质工作者便更加用力地争取机会，把国内搜集的地质资料送到国外刊物上登载，或者争取机会把比较重要的论文用外国文字写作，在国内出版。我们的地质工作者，特别是老一辈的地质工作者，当然作者在内，今天检查我们自己的过去，有多少人能够不痛心地忏悔我们犯过这种严重的错误？这样，不独使我们的科学工作与国内广大的群众脱离，并且让科学工作者们自身失掉了必要的自信心。其结果便趋向于不利用我们在国内所发现的大批的新鲜资料来建立更健全的中国地质学的基础，去解决我们所遇到的各种实际问题，而偏偏要把这大批的事实牵强附会地去附和国外一些陈腐的或者一些由狭隘观点出发的理论。这样不独阻挠了我们对面临迫切需要解决的问题的解决，并且阻碍了整个地质科学的进步。举个例说吧：我们这里有半个大陆的构造型式鲜明地摆在我们眼前，给我们绝无仅有的机会，来从事详细的调查和分析，自主地作出我们的结论；为什么要把有关阿尔卑斯山或者阿拍那羌山脉的某些构造情况、某些未必正确的理论当作框子来硬套上去呢？难道我们研究万里长城的构成非用建造爱费尔铁塔的方式来说明不可吗？这是毫无道理的。
    （二）
    旧时代的地质工作是有一定的成就的。但这并不是说，多制造了一些像“夹狗屁难解特岩”（主要由辉石和钛铁矿构成的超基性岩石）那一类光怪陆离的名词，或者多用一些稀奇古怪的、人们不大懂得的拉丁文和希腊文的字眼，就算是有了成绩。如果这也算成绩，那就把科学比成八股文章还不如了。我们的成绩，主要是我们收集了许多有关中国地质的事实，留下了许多描写事实的纪录。尽管资本主义国家的地质工作者，特别是英美的地质工作者，对于我们的成绩或者不理睬，或者以保留的态度来接受，尽管我们在确定事实的努力上作的还不够，但这一大堆事实的纪录，只要是正确的，那么，就都是极有科学价值的资料。
    但是我们也应该毫不忌讳地指出，在我们以往所作的纪录中，往往可以发现一些比较普遍的缺点。如：
    （一）对记述的正确性，包括矿物、岩石、古生物等种类的鉴定，态度不够严肃。
    （二）关于某些基本的事实，例如：局部地层的各种特征及其分类和层位的比较、火成岩体形状勘测的步骤和它最后的鉴定、各种构造成分鉴定的步骤和根据（例如确定一个断层所必需的种种证据）等等，或者列举不详，或者轻描淡写过去。这些都必然地引起一个严肃的地质工作者对那些纪录的价值发生怀疑。
    （三）在作结论时，往往态度模棱两可。对问题的解决，那怕是初步的解决，都不作肯定的或否定的决定。对观测所得的事实，不加分析，或分析不够详细；缺乏努力去指出问题的核心。
    （四）对过去有关的工作只是略略地叙述一句——如果提到的话——很少从新发现的事实或者新发现的任何正确的理由来加以适当的批评。相反地，如果对过去他人的工作有所批评的话，往往不免暴露一种粗略的、蔑视的或者漠视的态度。要想在我们过去的文献中找出虚心的、友爱的、无微不至的、和蔼而严正的批评，实在不太多了。由于缺乏诸如此类的正确批评，我们可以发现前后几次在一个地区调查研究过的工作人员彼此对同一矿藏的储量、同一地区的构造情况、同一地区的其它许多重大问题，往往意见不合，翻来覆去，莫衷一是。普通认为在最后一次参加工作的人的意见是比较正确的，但这却又不一定是可靠的。
    我们初步地检讨过去，已经发现了这样一些情况。当然还有更多的缺点，值得再加以严格的检查和批判。这种检查和批判的工作，大家都知道，是我们走上自我教育、自我改造的路上的第一个步骤。坦坦大道是摆在我们眼前的，但是开步走却要靠我们各人自己去努力。让我们欢欣鼓舞的是：自从解放以来，我们的地质工作者在我们的思想导师毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，针对着上述的缺点，进行了一系列的革命性的斗争，赢得了许多收获。我们的收获不是像过去那样单纯地表现在一堆业务性的报告和漂亮的论文上，而是就一些基本问题的解决取得了伟大的胜利。简单地说，首先我们认识了正确的工作方向和方法：科学必须为人民服务，科学必须是人民大众的事业。这是我们翻了身的人民对科学提出的迫切的要求；这也是保证科学发展的方向正确和它的内容丰富所必需的条件。在这样很明确的思想指导之下，结合着实际工作，经过不断的学习，特别是经过了伟大的“三反”运动胜利完成和思想改造学习之后，我们已经打垮了在过去反动统治时代所遗留下来的宗派主义以及个别小集团的结合；批判了个人英雄主义、纯技术观点等等恶劣作风；学会了为国家的机密保密，放弃了为个人的技术法宝保密的错误观念。我们开始懂得了如何面向人民、面向群众，我们开始认识了集体工作的意义和它的优越性，也认识了群众力量的伟大和群众智慧的无穷无尽的泉源。
    在现今世界形势和我们自己现有的物质条件之下，要建立我们的新国家，我们深深地体会到，首先必须拿出一切力量来开发我们地下的资源，从事经济建设和国防建设。过去，在反动统治时期，我们的一部分地质工作者，对于有关地下资源的调查研究缺乏热情，其一部分理由，就是不独看见了祖国当时没有那种需要，而且也体会到至少是间接地为开辟殖民地者服务。今天的情况完全不同了。从地下发见一斤半两有用的东西，都是为人民增加了财富，为国家工业化创造了条件。不仅是这样，毛主席曾经指示：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”因此，我们的科学家大可不必耽心，把全力用在经济发展方面，不仅不会对科学自身的发展有坏影响，而且将大大提高科学的水平。
    过去由于我们地质工作者对于工作的方向和方法没有正确的认识，野外工作者曾经有不少的人有过这样的经验：当我们在野外对着一块石头一锤打下去的时候，站在旁边的农民便连忙地问道：“你这是干什么？”“这个石头有什么用处？”我们有时候竟嘲笑农民们提出这样的问题，以极不端正的态度胡言乱语地对付一番。我们当时简直没有认识到这个问题的严肃性和指导性。我们应当认真地检查一下：在那一个地点打下那一块石头是不是有足够的理由不请求人民的支持？
    当我们给农民说明了这块石头是三叠纪的岩石（三叠纪是一万八九千万年以前世界上一个时代的名称），并且说明了从那个时代造成的岩石中我们将有发现若干种宝贵盐类的可能，那末，我们不但一定可以得到人民的支持，而且还可以发动广大群众去采集大批类似的或似是而非的标本，来发现更多有用的东西。事实上许多地方的矿苗甚至稀有矿石和稀奇的化石出产地点的情报，往往是人民群众供给的。这样，就说明了我们在野外工作的时候，是怎样容易抓紧机会来实践毛主席的指示的。
    从这样一个例子我们就可以了解怎样从我们地质工作者的日常工作中找出方向——面向人民，找出方法——和群众结合，把我们的科学事业推到人民的广大基础上去。如果说理论联系实际就可以这样做起，似乎也不是过分的。没有人否认，一切科学的活动，必须在理论或拟论的指导下进行；也没有人否认，不管理论和拟论，都或多或少是既知事实的总和与结晶。拟论的根据固然不像理论的根据那样广泛和巩固，但是无论什么理论总是不可避免地将随着我们从实践中对于客观事物的加深认识而加以修正的。
    （三）
    地质科学发展到了今天的阶段，我们可以说，决不是单靠几个拿铁锤的、背背包的地质工作者野外奔走，或者用分光镜或旋转台看一看岩石矿物的薄片就可以解决问题的。我们需要大量的出色的姊妹科学工作者，特别是物理学、化学乃至测量学、工程学的工作者，和我们协同工作或给我们指导，才能敢说我们有多少把握解决各种实际问题。我们都知道所有实际问题很少不是复杂的、不是需要多方面的专家合作来解决的。地质问题当然不在例外。
    另外，为了大规模展开地质勘测及其它一切连带的业务，我们也可以说，这不是几个少数的事务工作人员就可以对付得了的。我们必须在广大的基础上，用多种“兵团”组成的形式建立适当的机构、适当的制度，在统一指导下分途执行任务，才能达到统一的目标。
    要在前述适当的配合和严密的组织形式之下，来大规模地推动地质工作，很清楚，我们必须有工作的计划。一方面，配合国家经济建设的需要；另一方面，把既知的资料全部摊开，加以缜密的检查和分析，决定具体的操作方案，来尽量满足经济建设计划的要求。我们要牢牢地记着工作的集体性是我们走入社会主义必经的途径，它的计划性是集体工作必需的条件。但必需指出，这里存在一个内在的矛盾：计划愈精确，它的性能就愈强，可是不免愈呆板。计划愈粗略，它的性能必然愈弱，可是也有些适应发展的环境和适应事先不能预定的情况的方便。呆板性与弹性是矛盾的。怎样解决这种矛盾，唯有事先周密地考虑既知条件可靠的程度和机构组织的灵活性，随时能反映客观的情况，随时准备在既定的主要计划的范围内，对次要的计划加以调整。过去两三年中我们的地质工作者在不断的实现这种新的工作方向和方法的努力中已经创造了一定的成绩。在野外各工作队的队员已经不像过去那样大家面面相对、默默寡言或者发脾气，各人私自找自己所需要的材料准备回家去写报告、写论文，而是通过小组按时汇报、交流经验、提意见、作结论，以友爱的态度相互批评。另外，我们也作了一些工作计划，选择了重点，集中力量，按预定的步骤推进实际工作。
    由于逐渐地加强了这样的工作方法，我们也就一步一步地、比较可靠地增加了和修正了某些煤、铁和若干种有色金属储藏量的数字（例如：专就煤说，储藏量估计增加了二十二亿吨以上），并且肯定地推翻了某些带着开辟殖民地的使命来到中国的外国地质工作者粗心野气地关于中国地层、构造、古气候、古地理等等问题所作的结论。这些初步的成就当然还是大大地不够的。为了要迎接我们祖国经济建设的高潮，大规模地开展各种地下资源的勘探工作，我们中央人民政府最近已成立地质部。由于它的任务繁重，在它的机构中需要设立若干部门处理一般行政、人事（包括干部训练）、财务、供应、计划等项事务；若干部门处理直接有关业务的事务和解决业务问题。例如资料管理部门包括图书馆、陈列馆与全国各地钻探纪录及重要岩心等；测绘部门、探勘工程部门包括钻探槽探洞探及地球物理勘测工作；地质矿产勘测部门、编译工作部门、钻探总队等。另外为了加强联系，中国科学院地质和古生物两研究所也决定了在今后若干年中划归地质部领导。东北、西北、中南、西南四个地质局也由地质部领导。过去，在资本主义国家从来就只有小规模的地质机构来进行地质工作，唯有我们伟大的社会主义的邻邦苏联才有地质部的设立。因为只有劳动人民掌握政权以后，才有大规模发展地质工作的可能和必要。苏联的经验是很丰富的，我们必须吸收他们的经验，取得他们的帮助，才能在新民主主义到社会主义的道路上更迅速地发展我们的地质工作。至于资本主义国家方面地质工作的成果，我们也应该用极谨慎的态度加以严格地检查和分析，如果在比较资料和技术方面发现了有可取的东西，我们也不应该一概抹煞。面临着这样重大的任务，我们的队伍在数量上是大大地不够的，因此，需要赶快地训练大批的年青干部来参加地质勘测和与它相连带的工作。最近经政务院财政经济委员会和教育部协商，已经决定成立地质学院和地质专修科。前者修业期限四年，后者二年。有人问：二年期间能否训练出具有完成一定任务的能力的工作人员？我们可以肯定地说，是可以的。但是对于教学的办法必须加以改进：
    （一）在训练期间必须很经济地利用时间。我们对专科课程的内容必须事先有周密的安排，高深的、不是迫切需要的课目固然必须减少，就是每一课目中不太切合实际需要的教材也得删除。例如，矿物学显然是必需的科目，但是关于结晶学方面的教材就应该减少到最小限度，普通地质学当然也是必需的课目，但是其中与别的课目重复的地方（例如岩石学、构造地质学、地形学等等）就得尽量地删去，只着重于地质现象或各项地质变动程式的讲述。至于学科时间的运用，不宜死板板地执行“学实比”的制度。有若干课目教授到了某一阶段，需要加多实习而减少授课时间；而在另外一个阶段，则以加多授课时间减少实习更为有利。
    （二）必须让专科学生们有一定的机会深造，并且最好有一定的制度保证它的实现。这样，就可以提高同学们学习的情绪。经验告诉我们：经过一度在学校学习以后，参加实际工作，再从事于更高深的学习，成就往往是优越的。
    （四）
    在这伟大的有历史性的三个年头中，我们中国的地质工作者可以骄傲地说：我们已经初步学会了运用批评和自我批评的武器，战胜了许多腐败的习气，扫除了许多陈腐的东西。当今天我们祖国大规模的经济建设即将开始的时候，我们更可以骄傲地说：我们地质工作者被选拔出来参加经济战线上最前列的战斗是很荣幸的。为了保证胜利地完成这一光荣任务，我们每一个人必须竭尽一切的努力学习，才能加强我们自己的战斗力量。我们生活在毛泽东时代的人们的最大幸福，就是人人都有机会学习，时时刻刻都有机会学习。我们应脚踏实地地站在各个的工作中学会如何运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想来解决我们面临的实际问题。
    现在，我们大家都正在学习毛主席的“实践论”和“矛盾论”，我们能不能善于把“实践论”和“矛盾论”中所包含的一般真理，沿着我们地质工作者特殊的实践道路，由浅而深，一点一点地体现出来呢？这还是一个问题。但是，如果我们能这样做，那么不仅能引导我们胜利地去完成我们面临的迫切任务，而且将引导我们地质科学走向新的、更伟大的发展。
    让我们的地质工作同志们在毛泽东的旗帜下更紧密地团结起来，更勇敢地前进，争取我们在祖国的建设事业上、在地质科学的发展上更大的胜利。
