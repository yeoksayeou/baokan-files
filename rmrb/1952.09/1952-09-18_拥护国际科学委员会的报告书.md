    Endorsing the Report of the International Scientific Commission
    To the Editor: All faculty and students of Peking University unanimously endorse the "Report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China." As President Ma Yinchu said: "After suffering a disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism cruelly launched bacteriological warfare,妄想挽回注定的败局(desperately trying to salvage a doomed situation). This inhuman atrocity was already impossible to conceal, but they still put on airs and made all kinds of sophistry, attributing the diseases of the peaceful people of Korea and Northeast China caused by them to so-called 'natural plagues' and 'unhygienic environment,' trying to cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world. This kind of sophistry was not worth refuting in our eyes, but it may still deceive a part of the people who have always been deceived by them. Today, selfless international scientists have completely confirmed the crazy and shameless crimes of American imperialism with a very objective and scientific attitude. After reading this report, we can only deepen our anger and hatred. Even a small number of people who have been deceived will surely eliminate their doubts after reading this report, and unite closely with us to oppose the crimes of bacteriological warfare criminals. The peace-loving people of the world unite to save peace, and peace will surely be saved." Vice-President Tang Yongtong also said: "Honest and conscientious scientists absolutely respect the facts; all just and conscientious people will support this report." Yes, this report exposes the crimes of American imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare to the whole world and exposes the shameless denial of the war-mongers. This is a victory for the people of peace. We pay our highest respects to these scientists who adhere to the truth.
    Another fact of the report is that it confirms that the Chinese and Korean people have the power to prevent bacteriological weapons. Therefore, we firmly believe that peace will surely triumph, and science will surely triumph. If the American imperialist aggressors do not stop their heinous crimes, the people of the world will eventually give them a severe punishment! Peking University Correspondence Group

    拥护国际科学委员会的报告书
    编辑同志：我们北京大学全体师生一致拥护“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”。正如马寅初校长所说那样：“美帝国主义侵朝战争遭到惨败后，便残酷地发动细菌战争，妄想挽回注定的败局。这种灭绝人性的暴行本来已无可掩饰了，可是他们还要装腔作势，百般狡赖，对他们所造成的朝鲜和中国东北的和平人民的疾病，推诿于什么‘自然的瘟疫’、‘环境不卫生’，想一手掩尽天下人的耳目，真是无耻到极点。这种狡辩，在我们面前本来早已值不得一驳，可是它还可能蒙蔽被他们一向所欺骗的一部分人民。今天，无私的国际科学家用十分客观的、科学的态度完全证实了美帝国主义的疯狂无耻的罪行。我们看了这个报告，只有加深我们的愤怒和仇恨，就是一小部分受了蒙蔽的人民，看了这个报告后一定也会消除怀疑，和我们紧密地团结，反对细菌战犯的罪行。世界爱好和平的人民一致起来拯救和平，和平就一定会得救。”汤用彤副校长也说：“正直的、有良心的科学家是绝对尊重事实的；一切公正的、有良心的人都会拥护这个报告。”是的，这个报告把美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行公诸于全世界，揭穿了战争贩子的无耻抵赖，这是和平人民的胜利。我们向这些坚持真理的科学家致以崇高的敬礼。
    报告书的另一个事实是证实了中朝人民有力量防止细菌武器。因此，我们坚决相信：和平一定胜利，科学一定胜利，如果美帝国主义侵略者不停止他们的滔天罪行，全世界人民最后一定会给予他们以严厉的惩办！  北京大学通讯组
