    Sunflower seeds are one of the main raw materials for industrial oil. This year, the 100,000 mu of sunflowers in Huailai County, Chahar Province, will have a bumper harvest, with an estimated yield of 130 jin of sunflower seeds per mu. The county's supply and marketing cooperative has signed a contract with the provincial supply and marketing cooperative to purchase 10 million jin of sunflower seeds.
