The state-owned Tianjin cotton textile factories began promoting the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method in October and December of last year, respectively. By early February of this year, more than 90% of the fine yarn machine operators had learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method, and 80% to 90% of the weaving machine operators had learned the 1951 Weaving Work Method. The implementation was relatively good at the time. In May, the factories jointly conducted an inspection and found that the implementation of the two work methods was not as good as before. 38.57% of the fine yarn machine operators were implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method well; 40.17% of the weaving machine operators were implementing the 1951 Weaving Work Method well. At the end of July, the factories jointly conducted another inspection. The results of this inspection showed that the implementation was even worse. Only 17% were implementing the Hao Jianxiu Work Method relatively well; only 32.4% were implementing the 1951 Weaving Work Method well. The vast majority were implementing it in front of others but not behind their backs, during the day shift but not the night shift, when the work was easy but not when it was difficult. In addition to the poor quality of raw cotton and the hot weather increasing the difficulty of implementing the work methods, we believe that a more important reason is the deviation in the leadership of the promotion work.

First of all, the leading comrades lacked meticulous education work for the workers, and did not enable the workers to have a correct understanding of the superiority and advanced role of the work methods. For example, after using a large amount of Indian cotton and frost-damaged yellow cotton, the masses had a mentality of "hoping for good cotton," hoping to implement the work methods when good cotton arrived. Many cadres also recognized this. In fact, this understanding puts the implementation of advanced work methods in opposition to overcoming difficulties, and in opposition to completing production and quality plans. This is an incorrect understanding of the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Work Method.

Secondly, the promotion of advanced experience was treated with a task-oriented viewpoint, so that the promotion work was divorced from various movements and from production management, resulting in extreme formalism. At the beginning of the promotion work, the factories only carried out the promotion in response to the call of the higher authorities, so they regarded the promotion work as a temporary movement, as long as the amount of roller skin cotton decreased and the loom watching ability increased, it was considered a great achievement. Many management cadres and technical cadres mistakenly believed that the promotion and consolidation of these two work methods was a matter for the trade union and the workers, or for the "little teachers" and the promotion team, and was a new task and new work added outside of production management. They emphasized that the workshop was busy and there were many things to take care of, so they rarely cared about the implementation of the work methods. Under these circumstances, the connection between production links was naturally weakened. For example, the fine yarn workshop and the weaving workshop must cooperate with other processes to promote the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and the 1951 Weaving Method. However, in the process of promoting these two work methods in Tianjin's factories, with the exception of individual factories and individual workshops, comprehensive mobilization and cooperation were done very poorly. For example, the work of the front spinning and the cloth preparation room was not improved in time; the connection between maintenance and operation was not good enough; the machine could not be started for a long time after leveling and wiping the machine; there was a lack of necessary mutual assistance between various fixed-value workers and machine operators; the doffing work method in the fine yarn room was not summarized in time; tools such as scrapers and pushers were not well improved, etc. In particular, the lack of unified plans and unified steps in the actions of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League further affected the implementation and consolidation of these two work methods.

Again, in terms of leadership methods, it is simply to promote and inspect from top to bottom, without deeply mobilizing the masses. From the results of our joint inspection of various factories, the degree of implementation and the speed of changing when correcting shortcomings are greatly related to whether the masses are deeply mobilized. In workshops where the masses have been mobilized more deeply, the masses can consciously and regularly implement advanced work methods. In these workshops, workers automatically conduct inspections at group meetings, and formulate specific plans and inspection methods for each person, requiring the entire group and leading cadres to help improve. Individual groups also used the method of detailed accounting to correct the erroneous idea that bad cotton cannot implement work methods. However, only a very small number of workshops and groups can deeply mobilize the masses. In general, it is simply "promoting" and "inspecting" from top to bottom, without deeply mobilizing the masses. When promoting, these workshops focus on explaining the clauses and specific small actions of the operation method, and do not use the basic content of the work method to enlighten the masses to accept the work method ideologically. When explaining the operating method, it was not explained clearly why it must be done that way. When conducting inspections, the masses were not mobilized, but only a few "little teachers" were relied on. At the same time, the duties and working methods of the "little teachers" were not clearly explained. Although many little teachers are enthusiastic and responsible, they do not have many methods. After entering the workshop, they hold a watch in one hand and a notebook in the other, and when they see that a machine operator is slow or the operation is unreasonable, they record it and report it to the leadership. They are not good at providing specific guidance and assistance to workers during inspections. This kind of inspection not only cannot consolidate the promotion work, but also creates antagonistic emotions between workers and little teachers. On the other hand, due to the lack of in-depth inspection work, some excellent advanced workers have always adhered to the implementation of work methods, and have created excellent results even under extremely difficult objective conditions. However, the leadership has not been able to discover this situation for a long time, or even if they have discovered it, they have not summarized and disseminated it in time, and do not know how to use the experience of the masses to educate and mobilize the masses.

In addition to the above reasons, the fact that the wage system for machine operators has not been thoroughly reformed, and there are no appropriate reward methods, is also one of the reasons why the promotion work cannot be consolidated.

Since the beginning of August, the state-owned Tianjin cotton textile factories have conducted in-depth inspections targeting the above-mentioned main problems. The North China Textile Administration Bureau and various factories have successively rewarded advanced workers and groups who have achieved results in implementing these two work methods. The entire bureau has determined to focus on the implementation and consolidation of these two work methods to carry out production reform, promote the competition movement, and make the basic content of these two work methods more specific, and finally determine them as operating procedures. The Textile Administration Bureau has also decided to implement a fine yarn weighing system from September 1st, so that the personal interests of the workers are more closely integrated with the national interests.

    国营天津各棉纺织厂推广先进经验成绩为什么没有巩固
    华北纺织管理局制造处处长　张忱
    国营天津各棉纺织厂自去年十月和十二月先后开始推广郝建秀工作法与一九五一织布工作法后，到今年二月初已有百分之九十以上的细纱当车工学会了郝建秀工作法，有百分之八十到九十的织布车工学会了一九五一织布工作法，当时执行情况较好。五月各厂联合进行了一次检查，发现执行两种工作法的情况，已不如从前良好。郝建秀工作法执行好的占细纱当车工百分之三十八点五七；一九五一织布工作法执行好的占织布车工的百分之四十点一七。到七月底各厂又联合进行了一次检查，这次检查结果，发现执行情况更差。郝建秀工作法执行得比较好的只有百分之十七；一九五一织布工作法执行得好的只有百分之三十二点四。绝大多数都是当面执行，背后不执行，白班执行，夜班不执行，生活好做时执行，难做时不执行。其原因除原棉质量较坏，气候炎热增加执行工作法的困难外，我们认为更重要的还是对推广工作的领导有偏差。
    首先，就是领导同志对工人缺乏细致的教育工作，没有使工人对工作法的优越性和先进作用都有正确的认识。例如在大量用印度棉和霜黄花之后，群众中有“盼好花”的心理，盼望好花来了再执行工作法。很多干部也是这样认识。这种认识事实上是把先进工作法的执行和克服困难对立起来，和完成产量质量计划对立起来。是对郝建秀工作法与一九五一织布工作法的不正确的认识。
    其次，就是以任务观点对待推广先进经验工作，以致推广工作和各种运动脱节，和生产管理脱节，因而，形式主义极其严重。推广工作开始时，各厂只是为了响应上级号召而进行推广，因而把推广工作当作一时的运动，只要皮辊花减少看台能力提高就算大功告成。有不少管理干部和技术干部，错误地认为这两个工作法的推广和巩固是工会和工人的事情，或者是“小先生”和推广组的事情，是在生产管理之外另加的新任务和新工作。他们强调车间忙，事情多，顾不过来，因而对工作法的执行好坏很少过问。在这种情况下，生产环节之间的联系自然就减弱了。例如细纱车间和织布车间要推广郝建秀工作法和一九五一织布法，必须和其他工序配合。但是，天津各厂在推行这两个工作法的过程中，除了个别厂个别车间外，全面的动员和配合是做得很差的。比如，前纺工作和布场准备间的工作没有及时改进；保全与运转联系的也不够好，平车擦车之后，很长时间不能开车；各种定值工与车工缺乏必要的互助；细纱间的落纱工作法没有及时总结；擦板、推子等工具没有很好的改进等。特别是党、行政、工会、青年团的行动缺乏统一的计划与统一的步骤，更影响了这两个工作法的贯彻和巩固。
    再次，在领导方法上说，就是只简单地自上而下地推广和检查，没有深入发动群众。从我们各厂联合检查的结果来看，执行程度的好坏和改正缺点时转变的快慢，与是否深入发动群众有极大的关系。凡是比较深入地发动了群众的车间，群众就能自觉地经常地执行先进工作法。在这些车间中，工人自动地在小组会上进行检查，并订出每个人的具体计划和检查办法，要求全组及领导干部帮助改进。个别小组还用算细账的办法，纠正认为坏棉花不能执行工作法的错误思想。但是，能够深入发动群众的只是极少数的车间和小组。一般的都是简单的自上而下的“推行”和“检查”，不去深入发动群众。在推广时，这些车间偏重在解释操作法的条文和具体的小动作，没有用工作法的基本内容启发群众从思想上接受工作法。在讲解操作方法时也没有讲清楚为什么必须那样作。在进行检查时，也没有发动群众，只是依靠几个“小先生”。同时对“小先生”的职责和工作方法又没有明确交代，不少小先生虽然热情负责，但方法不多，进车间后一手拿表，
    一手拿笔记本，看着那个车工动作慢或操作的不合理，就记下来向领导方面汇报。他们不善于在检查中对工人进行具体的指导和帮助。这种检查不但不能巩固推广工作，反而造成工人与小先生之间的对立情绪。另一方面，由于检查工作不深入，某些优秀的先进工人虽一直坚持执行工作法，在客观条件极困难的情况下也创造出优异的成绩。但领导方面也长时间不能发现这种情况，即或发现了也没有及时总结和传播，不懂得用群众的经验去教育发动群众。
    除了上述原因外，当车工的工资制度还没有彻底改革，又没有适当的奖励办法，这也是推广工作不能巩固的原因之一。
    国营天津各棉纺织厂从八月初开始，针对上述主要问题进行了深入的检查。华北纺织管理局和各厂先后奖励了执行这两个工作法有成绩的先进工人和小组。全局已确定以这两个工作法的贯彻和巩固为中心，去进行生产改革，推进竞赛运动，把这两个工作法的基本内容更加具体化，最后确定为操作规程。纺织管理局并确定自九月一日起实行细纱过磅制度，使工人个人利益与国家利益更密切地结合起来。
