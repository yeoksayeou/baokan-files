Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th. Disregarding the just condemnation of the people of the world, the American aggressors once again indiscriminately bombed the Shuifeng Power Plant in Korea. From midnight on the 12th to the morning of the 13th, for three hours, more than 30 B-29 type bombers of the American Air Force frantically bombed the Shuifeng Power Plant again. According to the announcement of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army on the 14th, the anti-aircraft artillery units and air force units of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies bravely fought back against the attacking enemy planes, shooting down three enemy planes on the spot, giving the invading American aerial bandits a severe punishment.

As everyone knows, the Yalu River Power Plant in the Shuifeng area is by no means a "military facility," but purely a peaceful facility necessary for the daily life of the Korean people. The crazy bombing of the plant by American aerial bandits on June 23rd and 24th aroused severe condemnation from the people of the world. Thanks to the selfless labor of the Korean workers, the plant quickly restored power supply in a short period of time. However, the heinous American aggressors once again indiscriminately bombed and destroyed peaceful facilities.

Sources here pointed out: The criminal act of the American aircraft bombing the Shuifeng Power Plant again more clearly exposes the sinister conspiracy of the American aggressors to deliberately delay and sabotage the armistice negotiations and expand the war. The military and civilians of the entire Korean nation, together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, will continue to resolutely fight back against any provocative acts by the American aggressors and smash any conspiracy by the American aggressors.

    美国空中强盗再次滥炸水丰发电厂
    我空军与高射炮击落敌机三架
    【新华社平壤十七日电】美国侵略者不顾全世界人民的正义谴责，再一次对朝鲜水丰发电厂滥施轰炸。从十二日午夜到十三日晨的三小时内，美国空军以B—二九型轰炸机三十多架，再次对水丰发电厂进行疯狂的轰炸。据朝鲜人民军总司令部十四日发表，朝中人民军队的高射炮部队和空军部队奋勇迎击来袭的敌机，当场击落敌机三架，给予来犯的美国的空中强盗以严重的惩罚。
    人所共知，水丰一带的鸭绿江发电厂根本不是什么“军事设施”，而纯粹是朝鲜人民日常生活所必需的和平设施。美国空中强盗在六月二十三、二十四两日对该厂施行的疯狂轰炸，曾引起全世界人民的严厉谴责。由于朝鲜工人的忘我劳动，该厂在短期内即恢复供电。但是，穷凶极恶的美国侵略者竟又一次滥炸破坏和平设施。
    此间人士指出：美机再次滥炸水丰发电厂的罪恶行为，更清楚地暴露了美国侵略者蓄意拖延和破坏停战谈判以及扩大战争的险恶阴谋。朝鲜全国军民将和中国人民志愿军一道，继续坚决地迎击美国侵略者的任何挑衅行为，粉碎美国侵略者的任何阴谋。
