    Only the Friendship and Solidarity of Asian Nations is the Path to World Peace
    Matsumoto Jiichiro
    Although Asia possesses more than half of the world's population, abundant resources, and noble morals, its past history has been one of arbitrary rule by kings, warlords, and the trampling of Western European imperialism.
    Due to the oppression and divisive policies of cunning Western European imperialists, Asian nations have also long committed the error of fratricide and mutual slaughter; and because Western European imperialists cleverly implemented divide and rule, deep trenches and high walls were unconsciously created between Asian nations. The extremely cruel aggression carried out by Japan for nearly half a century has made this situation even more serious.
    However, the Japanese militarists and their running dogs—the zaibatsu—who dreamed of using the Emperor as a signboard to act as the leader of Asia and then dominate the world, collapsed with unconditional surrender.
    The storm in Asia has passed, the long history of darkness has come to an end, and the rising sun shines upon the earth. The Asian nations have finally awakened.
    The surging national liberation movement, the success of national independence, and the advance towards modernization are flourishing in combination with the desire for peace. Now, world peace will depend on the friendship and solidarity of the new Asia.
    But will the storm never return?
    Although the Japanese militarists are dead, some of the world's militarists still exist. Therefore, the road to bright liberation is still distant and rugged.
    Only a new Asia, united on the basis of supreme friendship and trust, can give all mankind the hope of world peace. Only by strengthening friendship and solidarity in the spirit of non-aggression, equality, and mutual benefit can Asian nations truly bring about world peace. In my office, I have established an "Asian Nations Friendship Association" as a bridge for the friendship and solidarity of Asian nations. Here, people from various Asian countries in Japan who yearn to realize peace and independence with brotherly love, establish a true Asia for Asians, and thereby liberate all of Asia, are gathering one after another. I believe that in this conversation full of Asian friendship, an atmosphere of friendship among Asian nations will be formed, a sense of unity will be generated, and the seeds of the great ideal of a united Asia will be produced. The true liberation of Asia will depend on these people who yearn for Asian peace and independence. I am determined to make this cause my lifelong mission.

    只有亚洲民族的友好与团结才是走向世界和平的道路
    松本治一郎
    亚洲虽然拥有全世界人口一半以上，并有丰富的资源和高尚的道德，但是过去亚洲的历史是被王侯，军阀所任意统治并听任西欧帝国主义蹂躏的历史。
    由于受到狡猾的西欧帝国主义者的压迫及其分化政策的操纵，亚洲各民族又在长期间内犯了兄弟阋墙互相残杀的错误；并且因为西欧帝国主义者巧妙地实行分治，所以就不知不觉地在亚洲民族之间造成了深沟高垒。近半世纪以来日本所进行的残暴绝伦的侵略，使得这种情况更为严重。
    然而梦想以天皇为招牌充当亚洲的盟主，并进而称霸于世界的日本军阀及其走狗——财阀，却随着无条件投降而崩溃了。
    亚洲的暴风雨过去了，长期的黑暗历史从此告终，旭日方升，照耀大地。亚洲各民族终于觉醒了。
    奔腾澎湃的民族解放运动、民族独立的成功以及向近代化的迈进，正与要求和平的愿望相结合而蓬勃发展。现在，世界的和平将决定于新生亚洲的友好与团结。
    但暴风雨是否再也不会来呢！！
    日本军阀虽已死亡，但一部分世界的军国主义者仍然存在。因此走向光明的解放道路还是遥远而崎岖的。
    只有新生的亚洲在无上崇高的友爱与信义的基础上团结一致，才能给全世界人类以世界和平的希望。亚洲各民族只有本着互不侵犯、平等互惠的精神，加强友好与团结，才能真正带来世界和平。在我的办事处里，我设立了一个“亚洲民族亲善协会”，把它作为亚洲民族的友好与团结的桥梁。在这里陆续地聚集了热望以兄弟般的友爱来实现和平与独立、建立真正的亚洲人的亚洲，从而解放全亚洲的在日本的亚洲各国人士。我相信：在这种充满着亚洲人的友爱的交谈中，将会形成亚洲民族友好的气氛，产生团结心，并产生全亚洲团结一致的伟大理想底萌芽。亚洲的真正解放将依靠这些热望亚洲和平与独立的人们来实现。我决心把这个事业当作我终生的任务。
