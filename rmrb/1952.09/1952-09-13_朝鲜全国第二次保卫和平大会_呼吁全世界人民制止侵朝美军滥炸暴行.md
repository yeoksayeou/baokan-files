Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The Second National Congress for the Defense of Peace in Korea was held in Pyongyang on September 8th. The congress issued a "Letter to Peace-Loving People of the World," the full text of which is as follows:

Today, as the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, which holds great significance for the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, is about to be convened, we, the representatives gathered at the Korean National Congress for the Defense of Peace, representing the will of all peace fighters and the entire Korean people, call on peace-loving people and kind people around the world to strengthen their struggle to end the bloody war launched by the US imperialists.

The struggle of the peace-loving Korean people, bravely rising up with weapons in hand to defend the freedom and independence of their homeland, has entered its third year.

The peace-loving Korean people deeply recognize that under the rule of foreign aggressors, there is and cannot be freedom, independence, peace, and a happy life for the people. Therefore, the Korean people are engaged in a heroic struggle against the US-British armed interventionists and the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique. The Korean people know that their struggle is part of the overall struggle of peace-loving people for world peace.

To achieve the goals of conquering Korea, depriving the Korean people of their freedom and independence, enslaving the Korean people, destroying peace, and expanding the war, the US armed aggressors have used the most despicable war methods and means.

The US aggressors have committed various crimes, such as barbarously bombing peaceful cities and villages, indiscriminately massacring and ravaging the elderly, women, and children, massively slaughtering and torturing our captured personnel in US prisoner-of-war camps, and using bacteriological weapons, chemical weapons, and napalm bombs. While delaying the armistice negotiations, the US armed interventionists are attempting to expand the war in Asia and massacre more peaceful residents of Korea. The plan concocted by General Clark's staff to destroy seventy-eight cities in North Korea is being accelerated.

The US military command, disregarding the protests of kind people around the world, continues to implement this plan. US aircraft continuously drop hundreds of tons of bombs on cities and villages in North Korea every day. A few examples are as follows:

From dawn on July 11th to 12th, 1952, more than 400 US aircraft carried out a cruel bombing and machine-gun strafing of Pyongyang and surrounding areas, dropping more than 6,000 napalm bombs, landmine bombs, fragmentation bombs, and time bombs in the residential areas of Pyongyang alone. As a result, more than 1,600 homes of peaceful residents were destroyed or burned down, and more than 6,000 women, elderly, and children were killed.

From the evening of July 13th to dawn on the 14th, US bomber groups dropped hundreds of tons of heavy bombs on the residential areas of Hamhung, which had no military targets, killing hundreds of women and children.

On July 18th, US aircraft concentrated on bombing Wonsan City and the county and township seats and rural areas in many counties of Kangwon Province, resulting in the deaths of many women, children, and elderly people, and the destruction or burning down of hundreds of urban and rural houses.

From July 11th to 31st, the aggressors dropped more than 18,000 various bombs in Pyongyang, Wonsan, Hamhung, Chongjin, and other places alone.

The Pyongyang area was continuously subjected to savage bombing on August 4th, 10th, 20th, 24th, and 27th.

On the morning of August 27th, formations of US Air Force B-29 bombers concentrated on bombing residential areas in the western district of Pyongyang and nearby rural areas for two hours, dropping more than 400 bombs weighing 500 to 1,000 kilograms, resulting in the deaths of many residents and the destruction or burning down of hundreds of dugouts and civilian houses.

On August 29th, the enemy carried out the most cruel large-scale bombing and machine-gun strafing of the Pyongyang area since the beginning of the war. On that day, from about 9:00 AM to the evening, US aerial bandits concentrated on bombing and strafing the entire Pyongyang area, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of peaceful residents and the destruction or burning down of hundreds of dugouts and civilian houses. Buildings set ablaze by napalm bombs continued to burn for two days, and dozens of residents were burned alive in dugouts surrounded by napalm flames.

The US aggressors are not only conducting bestial bombing of all cities in North Korea but also of thousands of rural areas and villages, large and small, and even remote dwellings in desolate mountains and fields, killing farmers working in the fields and destroying vast amounts of land and various crops, attempting to starve our Korean people to death. The US aerial bandits are attempting to turn the entire North Korea into ruins and kill all the residents of North Korea by carrying out this brutal concentrated bombing of the entire region.

Korean cities and villages are continuing to be destroyed and burned in the flames of war unleashed by the US imperialists. Fields are being turned over by bombs, forests and orchards are being burned, the blood of peaceful Korean residents continues to flow, and hundreds and thousands of lives are being sacrificed.

The US armed interventionists are attempting to weaken the fighting will of the peace-loving Korean people with brutal bombing, and attempting to force us to accept its unreasonable demands in the armistice negotiations, but the brutal bombing of the US armed interventionists has not and cannot subdue the Korean people. The more brutal the atrocities of the aggressors, the more fiercely the flames of hatred and anger of our Korean people towards the aggressors burn, and the more firm and consolidated our determination to defend the honor, freedom, independence, and peace of our homeland becomes.

Dear friends!
Peace fighters of the world!

The Korean people deeply recognize that peace cannot be waited for and must be won through active struggle. The Korean people clearly know that "if the people of all countries take on the cause of defending peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated."

Your struggle for peace and your brotherly sympathy and support for us encourage and inspire the Korean patriots to persevere in the just struggle for the freedom, independence, and peace of their homeland and the struggle to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world.

Dear friends!

We appeal to you: further展开斗争,要求立即停止美国侵略者对朝鲜和平居民的暴行，完全终止朝鲜战争，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。

We firmly believe that you will warmly respond to our call and take all possible measures to assist our just struggle for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Defeating the aggressors who are continuing to wage the war of aggression against Korea will be a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. In order to prevent your people from suffering the disasters that the Korean people are suffering today, launch the movement against war and for the defense of peace more vigorously and extensively!

Stop the US warmongers from preparing and provoking a new world war!

Peace will surely triumph over war!

The Second National Congress for the Defense of Peace in Korea
Pyongyang, September 8, 1952

    朝鲜全国第二次保卫和平大会
    呼吁全世界人民制止侵朝美军滥炸暴行
    【新华社平壤讯】朝鲜全国第二次保卫和平大会于九月八日在平壤举行，大会发表了“告全世界爱好和平人民书”，全文如下：
    在对于亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民有着巨大意义的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议行将召开的今天，我们集合在朝鲜全国保卫和平大会的代表们，代表朝鲜的全体和平斗士们和全朝鲜人民的意志，呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民和善良的人们加强斗争，终止美帝国主义者所发动的流血战争。
    爱好和平的朝鲜人民手执武器英勇奋起进行保卫自己祖国自由独立的斗争已经进入第三年了。
    爱好和平的朝鲜人民深切认识到：在外国侵略者的统治下，就没有也不可能有人民的自由、独立、和平与幸福的生活。因此，朝鲜人民为反对美英武装干涉者和李承晚卖国匪帮而进行着英雄的斗争。朝鲜人民知道：他们的斗争就是爱好和平人民为了世界和平的全面斗争的一部分。
    美国武装侵略者为了达到征服朝鲜、剥夺朝鲜人民的自由独立、奴役朝鲜人民、破坏和平扩大战争的目的而使用了最卑鄙的战争方法和手段。
    美国侵略者制造着野蛮地轰炸和平城市与农村、无差别地屠杀和蹂躏老人妇女与儿童、在美方战俘营里大量地屠杀和拷问我方被俘人员、使用细菌武器化学武器和凝固汽油弹等各种罪行。美国武装干涉者在拖延停战谈判的同时，企图在亚洲扩大战争，更多地屠杀朝鲜的和平居民。克拉克将军参谋部所制造的毁灭北朝鲜七十八个城市的计划正在加紧地实施着。
    美军司令部不顾全世界善良的人们的抗议，继续在施行着这个计划。美国飞机每天不间断地向北朝鲜的城市和农村投下数百吨炸弹。举几个实例如下：
    一九五二年七月十一日到十二日天未明时，四百多架美国飞机对平壤市及附近地区进行了残酷的轰炸和机枪扫射，仅在平壤市居民区就投下了六千多颗凝固汽油弹、地雷弹、杀伤弹和定时炸弹，结果一千六百多所的和平居民土窟房舍被破坏或烧毁，六千多名妇女老人和儿童牺牲了。
    七月十三日晚到十四日天未明时，美国轰炸机群向没有任何军事目标的咸兴市居民区投下了数百吨重磅炸弹，杀害了数百名妇女和儿童。
    七月十八日，美国飞机集中地轰炸了元山市及江原道很多郡所在地和面所在地及农村，结果许多妇女儿童老人被杀害，数百所城市民房和农舍被破坏或烧毁。
    从七月十一日到三十一日，侵略者仅在平壤、元山、咸兴、清津等地就投下了一万八千多颗各种炸弹。
    平壤地区在八月四日、十日、二十日、二十四日、二十七日连续遭到野蛮的轰炸。
    八月二十七日早晨，美国空军B二十九型轰炸机编队集中轰炸平壤市西区居民地带和附近农村达两小时，投下四百多颗五百公斤到一千公斤的炸弹，结果很多居民被杀害，数百所土窟和民房被破坏或烧毁。
    八月二十九日，敌人对平壤地区进行了战争开始以来最残酷的大规模轰炸和机枪扫射。那一天美国空中强盗从上午九时许到傍晚集中轰炸扫射平壤市全区，结果数百名和平居民被杀害，数百所土窟民房被破坏或烧毁，被凝固汽油弹烧着的建筑物继续燃烧了两天，数十名居民在被凝固汽油弹的火焰包围着的土窟中活活烧死。
    美国侵略者不但对北朝鲜一切城市而且对数千个农村和大小村落甚至荒山旷野的偏僻村舍进行野兽般的轰炸，杀害在田地里劳动的农民，破坏大量田地和各种农作物，妄图饿死我们朝鲜人民。美国空中强盗企图以对北朝鲜全部地区进行这种残暴的集中轰炸来把整个北朝鲜变成废墟，把北朝鲜的全体居民杀光。
    朝鲜的城市和农村正在美帝国主义者所纵放的战争火焰里继续被破坏和烧毁，田地被炸翻，山林和果园被焚烧，朝鲜和平居民的鲜血在继续流着，成百成千的生命在牺牲着。
    美国武装干涉者企图以残暴的轰炸削弱爱好和平的朝鲜人民的斗争意志，企图迫使我们接受它在停战谈判中的无理要求，但是美国武装干涉者的残暴轰炸并未能也不可能使朝鲜人民屈服。侵略者的暴行越残暴，我们朝鲜人民对侵略者的憎恨和愤怒的火焰就燃烧得越炽烈，保卫自己祖国荣誉、自由、独立与和平的决心也就越发坚定和巩固。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    全世界的和平斗士们！
    朝鲜人民深切地认识到：和平绝不能等待而必须以积极的斗争来争取。朝鲜人民清楚地知道：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固”。
    你们争取和平的斗争和你们对我们的兄弟般的同情和声援，鼓舞和激励着朝鲜的爱国者们坚持争取自己祖国自由、独立与和平的正义斗争和巩固远东及全世界和平的斗争。
    亲爱的朋友们！
    我们向你们呼吁：进一步展开斗争，要求立即停止美国侵略者对朝鲜和平居民的暴行，完全终止朝鲜战争，从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队。
    我们坚决相信：你们将会热烈地响应我们的号召，并为了援助我们的争取和平解决朝鲜问题的正义斗争而采取一切可能的措施。
    战胜继续在进行着侵朝战争的侵略者将是对于保卫亚洲及全世界和平事业的莫大贡献。为了不让你们的人民明天遭受像朝鲜人民今天所遭受着的灾难，更有力更广泛地展开反对战争保卫和平的运动吧！
    制止美国战争贩子准备和挑拨新的世界战争！
    和平必将战胜战争！
        朝鲜全国第二次保卫和平大会
        一九五二年九月八日于平壤市
