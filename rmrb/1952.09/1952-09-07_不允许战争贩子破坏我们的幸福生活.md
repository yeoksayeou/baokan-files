War-Mongers Shall Not Be Allowed to Ruin Our Happy Life
Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda

This spring, I participated in the Chinese Farmers' Delegation and visited the Soviet Union for more than four months. Now I have returned to Beijing from Moscow.

In the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the status and lives of us farmers have undergone earth-shaking changes. In the old society, a suffering man like me, who grew up in a remote mountainous area (Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province), toiled in the mountains all year round. I had rarely even been to the county seat, let alone a big city. Now, as a representative of Chinese farmers, I am able to visit the Soviet Union. This was something I wouldn't have dared to dream of in the past. This is not only the glory of our hundreds of farmer representatives but also the glory of all the farmers in the new China.

In the old society, how miserable was the life of us farmers! We farmed for the landlords all year round with empty stomachs, eating "cornmeal buns" and living in broken cave dwellings and sheds made of sorghum stalks. Since the establishment of the People's Government, the Communist Party has led us in rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, and the great production movement. Our lives have been improving day by day. Before liberation, our Xigou Village had only twenty-odd sheep and a dozen livestock. Now we have more than six hundred sheep and seventy-six livestock. In the past, the average yield per mu was one hundred seventy or eighty jin, but now it has increased to three hundred seventy jin. The mountains around Xigou Village were originally barren with no trees, but now there are more than 20,000 trees, and apple, peach, pear, and other fruit trees have also been planted. Now, the farmers eat pure grains three times a day. They have moved into newly built houses and even manage to change their clothes three times a year (single layer, lined, and cotton). We also have cooperatives, elementary schools, and libraries in our village...

We have turned a poor ravine into a rich one. However, we are not satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We have now formulated a three-year construction plan: we will greatly increase fertilizer, improve cultivation techniques, and increase production by another one hundred sixty-six and a half jin on the basis of the average yield of three hundred seventy jin per mu. We will build reservoirs to turn dry land into paddy fields. We will make our mountains have larger forests, orchards, and flocks of sheep. We will build a large number of new houses, expand our elementary school, and universally establish reading groups. We will also install radios and hold regular concerts. We want to make the mountain ravine more beautiful and make our lives better!

The people in our village all realize this: the interests of each of us are closely linked with the interests of the collective, and the construction of our village is tightly connected with the construction of the entire country. When it is harvest time, we all select the best grain to hand over as public grain. We conscientiously cultivate the land for the families of martyrs and soldiers, ensuring that their land yields the most. We once pledged to the motherland: "Whatever the motherland needs, with a single call, we will provide people and money!"

We also realize that our construction is closely related to the struggle of the people of all countries in the world to defend peace. My visit to the Soviet Union this time made me see this even more clearly. I traveled through five provinces and more than ten districts in the Soviet Union. From cities to villages, we received care like relatives at every gathering or banquet. This was my first time abroad, and I didn't understand Russian, but the kind faces of every Soviet brother and sister deeply moved me. I didn't feel like I was in an unfamiliar foreign country, but rather in a close-knit family. When we visited collective farms, they patiently and carefully answered our questions, afraid that we wouldn't understand clearly. A collective farm chairman in his sixties warmly took my hand and told me:

"As long as our experience is useful for building the new China, I would like to tell you everything, because I know that the victory of the Chinese people's construction will greatly strengthen the power to defend world peace!" This brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is something I will never forget.

We will never allow American imperialism and war-mongers to destroy our orchards, forests, and flocks of sheep. I believe that with the close unity of the people of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union, and with the people of all peace-loving countries joining hands tightly, we will surely defeat a handful of war-mongers!

We warmly welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing soon, because we believe that this conference will promote the peace movement of the people of various countries to achieve greater development and provide a more powerful guarantee for Asian peace and even world peace.

### 不允许战争贩子破坏我们的幸福生活

    不允许战争贩子破坏我们的幸福生活
    农业劳动模范　李顺达
    今年春天我参加了中国农民代表团，在苏联参观了四个多月，现在从莫斯科回到北京了。
    在毛主席领导下的新中国，我们农民的地位和生活起了天大的变化。在旧社会里，像我这样一个生长在偏僻山区（山西省平顺县西沟村）的受苦汉，终年在山沟里受苦劳动，不要说大城市，连县城也很少去过。现在，我以中国农民代表的身份能够到苏联参观，这在过去是做梦也不敢想到的。这不只是我们几百个农民代表的光荣，而且是新中国全体农民的光荣。
    在旧社会里，我们农民的生活是多凄惨啊！我们终年饿着肚子给地主种地，吃的是“糠疙瘩”，住的是破窑洞和用高粱秆搭成的棚子；自从人民政府成立后，共产党领导着我们进行了减租减息、土地改革和大生产运动，我们的生活一天比一天改善了。解放前，我们西沟村只有二十多只羊，十几头牲口，现在我们有六百多只羊，七十六头牲口了；过去每亩地平均产量一百七八十斤，现在已增加到三百七十斤了；西沟村一带原是没有一棵树木的荒山，现在已有树两万多棵，而且还栽种了苹果、桃、梨等果树；现在，农民们一天三顿都是吃纯粮，他们搬进了新修的房子里，还做到一年三换衣裳（单、夹、棉），我们村里还有了合作社、小学校、图书馆……。
    我们已把一条穷沟变成了富沟。但是，我们并不满足于已有的成绩，现在又制订了三年的建设计划：我们要大量增加肥料、提高耕作技术，在每亩平均产量三百七十斤的基础上，再增产一百六十六斤半；要修建水库，变旱田为水田；要使我们的山上出现更大的森林、果树园和羊群，要修建大批新的房舍，要扩大我们的小学校，普遍成立读报组；还要设上收音机，定时举行音乐会。我们要把山沟变得更美丽，把生活变得更美好！
    我们村上的人都认识到这样一点：我们每个人的利益和集体的利益，我们村里的建设和整个国家的建设是紧紧地拧在一起了。当收获的时候，我们都是选出最好的粮食交公粮；我们认真地给烈、军属代耕，使他们的每亩土地的产量最多；我们曾向祖国保证：“祖国需要什么，只要一声号召，要人有人，要钱有钱！”
    我们也认识到：我们的建设和世界各国人民保卫和平的斗争，是息息相关的。我这次出国到苏联参观，更清楚地看到这点了。我在苏联游历了五个省，十多个区，从城市到乡村，在任何一个集会，或者是宴会上，我们都受到了亲人般的照顾。我是初次出国，又不懂苏联话，但是每一个苏联兄弟姊妹的亲切的面容，使我深深感动了，我不觉得是到了一个生疏的外国，而是到了一个亲密的大家庭里。我们访问集体农庄的时候，问长问短，他们都是耐心地仔细地解答，惟恐我们听不清楚。一个六十多岁的集体农庄主席便曾亲热地拉着我的手告诉我：
    “只要我们的经验对建设新中国有用，我恨不得什么都告诉您，因为我知道中国人民建设的胜利，会大大增强保卫世界和平的力量啊！”中苏两国人民间这种兄弟般友谊，是我永世不能忘记的。
    我们决不允许美帝国主义和战争贩子们破坏我们的果园、森林和羊群。我相信有了中苏两大国人民的亲密团结，和世界各国爱好和平人民紧紧拉起手来，我们一定可以打败一小撮战争贩子！
    我们热烈欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议不久在北京召开，因为我们相信，这次会议会推动各国人民的和平运动获得更大的发展，使亚洲和平以至世界和平得到更有力的保障。
