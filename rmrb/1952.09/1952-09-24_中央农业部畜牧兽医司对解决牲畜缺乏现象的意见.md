    Opinions of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture on Solving the Shortage of Livestock

    Editor: The "Reader's Letters" page of August 27th published a letter from the Xing County People's Government of Shanxi Province, reflecting the problem that local people could not buy sheep after obtaining loans, and a brief commentary on the issue. We fully agree with the opinions put forward in the brief commentary. Over the past three years, under the education and encouragement of the three major movements of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen across the country for developing animal husbandry production has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, there is a widespread feeling across the country that livestock is insufficient, and there is an urgent need to vigorously increase it. The fundamental way to increase livestock is to strengthen the protection of livestock, improve feeding management, and increase livestock reproduction rates; it cannot be simply relied upon purchasing and adjusting. In order to fundamentally increase livestock, our ministry put forward the animal husbandry policy of "protecting livestock and rewarding breeding" as early as 1949, and implemented specific measures such as prohibiting indiscriminate slaughter, preventing and controlling animal epidemics, storing winter grass, and supporting private breeding households. Over the past three years, the national animal husbandry industry has made great achievements. The number of cattle and donkeys has exceeded the pre-war level; other large and small livestock, except for mules, are also close to the pre-war numbers.

    Due to the different natural conditions in various regions, the development of livestock cannot be consistent; the adjustment of surpluses and shortages between each other is also necessary. At present, our ministry can only grasp the supply and demand of livestock in major administrative regions, and introduce and organize the adjustment of livestock between major administrative regions. At the animal husbandry group of the National Agricultural Production Conference in 1951, our ministry proposed that major administrative regions report the supply and demand of livestock to our ministry for overall adjustment. Since then, some specific work has been done, such as in the spring of 1952, introducing the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department to purchase 300 horses, 700 cattle, and 6,000 sheep in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Chahar and Suiyuan; introducing Henan, Suiyuan, Chahar and other provinces to purchase dairy cows in Nanjing and Shanghai, solving the problem of excessive young male cattle in the two major cities. However, in the past, the grasp of the situation and overall leadership were not good enough, and efforts should be made to improve in the future.

    As for adjustments within major administrative regions, such as between provinces, between special districts, or between counties, they can be handled by major administrative regions or provinces; if there are specific difficulties, they should be reported to our ministry for resolution. Regarding the matter that the masses in Xing County, Shanxi, could not buy sheep after obtaining loans, our ministry received a report on July 29th, and on August 1st, we notified the relevant departments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Gansu Province to provide the possible supply figures, so that Shanxi could send people to purchase. In addition to sending letters to urge inquiries, we have also informed the leading comrades of the Shanxi Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau to attach importance to this matter and quickly help the Xing County People's Government solve it.

### 中央农业部畜牧兽医司对解决牲畜缺乏现象的意见

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央农业部畜牧兽医司对解决牲畜缺乏现象的意见
    编辑同志：八月二十七日“读者来信专页”刊载了山西省兴县人民政府反映当地群众贷款后买不到绵羊问题的来信和关于这个问题的简评。我们完全同意简评中提出的意见。三年来，全国农牧人民在抗美援朝、土地改革及镇压反革命三大运动的教育鼓舞下，大大地提高了发展畜牧生产的热情。因此，全国各地普遍感到牲畜不够，亟须大力增殖。增加牲畜的根本办法是加强保护牲畜，改善饲养管理和提高牲畜繁殖率；而不能单纯地依靠购买调剂。我部为了从根本上增加牲畜，早在一九四九年就提出了“保护牲畜、奖励繁殖”的畜牧方针，进行了禁止滥宰、防治兽疫、存贮冬草及扶助民营配种户等具体措施。三年以来，全国畜牧事业已有很大成就。现在黄牛和驴的数额已超过战前水平；其他大小家畜，除骡以外，也都接近战前数额。
    由于各地区自然条件的不同，牲畜发展的情况是不可能一致的；彼此间的盈缺调剂工作也是需要的。目前我部只能掌握各大行政区的牲畜供求情况，介绍和组织各大行政区间的牲畜调剂工作。我部在一九五一年全国农业生产会议的畜牧小组上，曾提出让各大行政区将牲畜供求情况报告我部，以便统筹调剂。此后，还做了一些具体工作，如一九五二年春曾介绍东北农林部在内蒙古自治区和察哈尔、绥远购到马三○○匹、牛七○○头、羊六、○○○头；介绍河南、绥远、察哈尔等省到南京、上海购买乳牛，解决了两大都市的小公牛过剩问题。但过去对于情况掌握和全面领导是做得很不够的，今后应该努力改进。
    至于大行政区之内，如省与省间、专署与专署间、或县与县间的调剂事宜，可由各大行政区或省负责；如遇具体困难，再报请我部解决。山西兴县群众贷款后买不到羊一事，我部在七月二十九日得到报告，八月一日就分别通知内蒙古自治区和甘肃省有关部门，请他们提出可能供给的数字，以便山西去人购买。现在除再去信催问外，并已面告山西畜牧兽医局领导同志重视这件事，迅速帮助兴县人民政府解决。
