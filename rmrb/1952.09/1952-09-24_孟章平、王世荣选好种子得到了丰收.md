    Meng Zhangping and Wang Shirong Achieve a Good Harvest by Selecting Good Seeds
    Editor: Poor peasants Meng Zhangping and Wang Shirong from Minxian Village, Mingyang Township, Ziyang County, Sichuan, used carefully selected good seeds from the fields last autumn to plant their four mu of paddy fields. They harvested an average of over 700 jin of rice per mu, breaking the conservative thinking of the local people who were not accustomed to selecting seeds.
    Last autumn, Meng Zhangping and Wang Shirong's several mu of paddy fields suffered a very serious drought, and half of the rice did not fill, turning white. They were worried that leaving these rice plants as seeds would cause more rice to turn white. Later, they were determined to select good rice ears with full grains, many grains, and consistent maturity in the fields as seeds. When they were selecting seeds, old farmers Wang Dashou, Li Shuanggui, and Granny Li in the village ridiculed them. Granny Li said, "I've lived for seventy-five years and haven't seen anything like this. The sun is so hot, selecting them one by one. If you asked me to do that, I'd rather not plant rice seedlings next year." However, Meng Zhangping and Wang Shirong did not lose heart. They patiently selected eight or nine sheng of good seeds. This spring, they used these seeds for sowing. Recently, when the rice matured, it grew very well. The most abundant ears had more than 330 grains, and the least had 250 grains, averaging about 290 grains per ear. Wang Shirong's two mu of land harvested four shi, two dou, and six sheng of grain, and Meng Zhangping's two mu harvested four shi and one dou (the average yield per mu in the village is one shi and five dou). The news of the bumper harvest quickly spread throughout the village. Many people came to visit. Granny Li didn't believe it at first, but when she saw the living facts, she said, "Chairman Mao told us to select seeds, and he was absolutely right." She repeatedly asked Wang Shirong to save two sheng of good seeds for her. Now, under the education of the facts, all the villagers are determined to do a good job in seed selection and strive to achieve a bumper harvest next year. Liang Xiang

    孟章平、王世荣选好种子得到了丰收
    编辑同志：四川资阳县明阳乡民贤村贫农孟章平和王世荣有四亩稻田，是用去年秋天在田间精选的好种子种的，平均每亩收获了七百多斤稻子，打破了当地群众不习惯选种的保守思想。
    去年秋天，孟章平和王世荣的几亩稻田受了相当严重的旱灾，有半数稻子没有灌浆，抽白了。他们曾耽心留这些稻子作种，将会有更多的稻子抽白。后来他们下决心在田间抽选颗粒满、颗粒多、成熟期一致的好穗子作种。当他俩正在进行选种的时候，村里老农王大寿、李双贵、李大娘等都讥笑他们。李大娘说：“我活了七十五岁，还没看见过这种事，太阳晒得那么热，一根根的选，叫我干，我宁可明年不栽秧。”可是孟章平、王世荣二人并没有泄气。他们耐心地选了八、九升好种子。今年春天，他们就用这些种子播种。到最近稻子成熟了，都长得很好，最多的每穗有三百三十多粒，少的也有二百五十粒，平均每穗约有二百九十粒。王世荣的两亩田收谷四石二斗六升，孟章平的两亩收四石一斗多
    （该村每亩平均收一石五斗）。丰收的消息马上传遍了全村。许多群众都跑来参观。李大娘起初不相信，等到看到了活生生的事实时，她说：“毛主席叫我们选种，硬是没有错。”她再三要求王世荣给她留两升好种。现在全村群众在事实的教育下，都决心要做好选种工作，争取明年也能达到丰收。 良响
