Reply from the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry
    on "Neglecting Survey and Drilling Work at the Hebi Coal Mine"

    Editor: Wang Xue's criticism in the People's Daily on August 23rd, Second Edition, regarding "Neglecting survey and drilling work in the basic construction of the Hebi Coal Mine" is completely correct. The details of the matter and the handling are explained as follows:

    The Pingyuan Provincial Department of Industry did not conduct a geological survey before carrying out drilling work at the Hebi Coal Mine, but blindly drilled holes. As a result, after drilling ten holes, the geological structure and coal seam conditions were still not clear, and no attention was paid to hydrogeological surveys. We specifically raised these issues for discussion at the "National Coal Mine Geological Drilling Conference" convened by the Central Fuel Industry Ministry in May this year. Combining the reports of Soviet experts and the instructions of Minister Chen Yu, we resolved the following points to be noted by the Pingyuan Provincial Department of Industry:

    1. Re-investigate the general geological conditions of the Hebi Coal Mine to clarify the geological structure.
    2. Use the existing boreholes to supplement with a few more boreholes, first determine several borehole lines, and create two cross-sectional maps perpendicular to the coal seam strike to clarify the main coal seams and geological structures, and then determine other borehole lines to understand the entire coalfield structure.
    3. Drill more boreholes within the mine field to determine the precise reserves.
    4. Pay attention to hydrogeology during drilling.

    The above four points were agreed upon by Cui Fenghao and Zhang Jiafu, representatives of the Pingyuan Provincial Department of Industry who attended the meeting at the time, and they said they would convey them to their superiors after returning to the Department of Industry. However, the Department did not follow the above four methods and blindly proceeded with construction, which is very wrong. We did not check their implementation of the resolutions after the meeting, which is also worth reviewing. Now, our bureau has assigned engineering cadres to the site for inspection and to assist in resolving related issues.

### 中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局  对“鹤壁煤矿忽视勘察、钻探工作”的答复

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局
    对“鹤壁煤矿忽视勘察、钻探工作”的答复
    编辑同志：人民日报八月二十三日第二版刊载的王雪同志对“鹤壁煤矿基本建设忽视勘察和钻探工作”的批评，完全正确。现将事情经过和处理说明如下：
    平原省工业厅对于鹤壁煤矿的钻探工作，事先没有经过地质调查，即盲目钻眼，结果打了十个钻眼还没有弄清楚地质构造和煤层情况，更未注意水文地质的调查。这些情况，我们在今年五月中央燃料工业部召开的“全国煤矿地质钻探会议”上特别提出讨论过，并结合苏联专家的报告和陈郁部长的指示，决议下列各点，要平原省工业厅注意：
    一、从新调查鹤壁煤矿的一般地质情况，弄清地质构造。
    二、利用已有钻眼再补充几个钻眼，先定出几条钻眼线，制出两个与煤层走向垂直的剖面图，弄清主要的煤层和地质构造，然后再定其他钻眼线，以了解全部煤田构造。
    三、在井田范围内多打钻眼，求出精确的埋藏量。
    四、钻探时要注意水文地质。
    以上四点，已由当时参加会议的平原省工业厅代表崔凤高、张家福二同志表示同意，并说回工业厅后向上级转达。但该厅未照上述四种办法办理，就盲目进行施工，这是非常错误的。我们在会议后未检查他们执行决议的情况，这也是值得检讨的。现在，我局已指派工程干部赴现场检查，并协助解决有关问题。  中央燃料工业部煤矿管理总局
