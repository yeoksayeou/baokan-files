After the conclusion of the literary rectification study, 42 literary workers with creative experience from the North China region, and the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan, as well as Beijing Municipality, have recently gone deep into factories and rural areas to experience real life and engage in literary creation. Through this literary rectification, the political awareness of literary workers in North China has been raised a step further. Many literary workers who have gone to factories and rural areas are determined to go to life honestly to transform themselves. They have corrected the past method of interviewing as guests and have participated in the actual work in various places. Some have served as deputy secretaries of district committees, some have appeared as propagandists, and some have become teachers of the quick literacy method. They try every means and use various methods to get close to the masses. In addition to directly helping the masses in production work and cultural and current affairs studies, some use their spare time to teach primary school students to perform the Yangko dance; others write songs for the masses and teach the masses to sing in clubs. Because they can closely integrate with the masses, they have gained many things that they could not imagine when sitting in the upper levels. For example, the masses' love for "getting organized" and the infinitely close and friendly specific situations of interpersonal relationships in the new society have given them very profound inspiration. They deeply feel the losses caused by being divorced from the masses in the past few years, and they all believe that only by dedicating themselves to going deep into reality and connecting with the masses can they discover the rich life of the masses in the Mao Zedong era and do a good job in literary work.

In order to consolidate the achievements of the literary rectification, the Propaganda Department of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, in addition to instructing the propaganda departments of local party committees to pay attention to the ideological leadership and organizational leadership of creative work, discover and promote new working methods, also directly contacts many writers with creative experience to understand and absorb their experience in their work, and forwards it to literary workers in various places for reference; it compiles and prints newly published important domestic and Soviet articles on the theory and criticism of literary creation, and distributes them to literary workers in various places for study.

    华北文艺整风学习结束
    文艺工作者深入工厂、农村体验生活
    在文艺整风学习结束之后，华北区和河北、山西、平原三省及北京市最近已有具有创作经验的文艺工作者四十二人，分别深入工厂、农村，体验实际生活，从事文艺创作。经过这次文艺整风，华北区文艺工作者的政治认识提高了一步，许多到工厂、农村去的文艺工作者，都抱着老老实实到生活中去改造自己的决心。他们纠正了过去作客采访的方式，参加了各地的实际工作，有的担任了区委副书记，有的以宣传员的身份出现，有的当速成识字法的教员。他们想尽各种办法，运用各种方式来接近群众。除了直接在生产工作、文化时事学习中帮助群众外，有的利用空暇教小学生扭秧歌；有的替群众编歌子，在俱乐部教群众拉拉唱唱。由于他们能和群众密切结合，所以获得了许多过去坐在上层不能想像到的东西。比如群众对“组织起来”的热爱和新社会人与人之间关系的无限亲密友好等具体情况，都给了他们以非常深刻的启发。他们深深感到几年来脱离群众所造成的损失，都认为今后只有一心致力于深入实际，联系群众，才能发现毛泽东时代群众的丰富生活，作好文艺工作。
    为了巩固文艺整风的成果，中共中央华北局宣传部除指示各地党委宣传部重视创作工作的思想领导、组织领导，发现和推广新的工作方法外，并直接和许多有创作经验的作家取得联系，了解和吸取他们工作中的经验，转发各地文艺工作者参考；汇印新发表的国内和苏联关于文艺创作的理论与批评的重要文章，发给各地文艺工作者学习。（新华社）
