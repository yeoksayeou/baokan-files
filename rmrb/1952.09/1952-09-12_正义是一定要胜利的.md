Justice is Bound to Triumph
    Zhang Zhimin

On the Korean battlefield, the front-line units of our side feel the ebb and flow of enemy and our forces most profoundly over the past two years. Our soldiers' eyes are watching the enemy's changes every day, and the soldiers often use the enemy's embarrassment, wolfishness, and panic as material for jokes. When someone comes to the front from the rear, the soldiers must talk to you about these things.

One night when I first arrived at the front, I was chatting with a soldier named Li Yuheng at the entrance of a tunnel. Shells were constantly sounding on the position, some fired from the enemy, exploding in front of our position; but as soon as the enemy's shells had sounded, Comrade Li Yuheng said to me: "Watch! Our artillery will start soon!"

Sure enough, as soon as he finished speaking, our shells flew towards the enemy like rows of fire doves. Then, the artillery observation post reported the situation to the rear command post: "Our artillery has collapsed the enemy's artillery position!" Comrade Li Yuheng said to me, "This is called 'the enemy hits, we hit.' The enemy has what we have, and it's even better than the enemy's. The enemy's artillery can't hurt one of us in a thousand rounds, but our artillery doesn't miss when it goes out. The enemy's artillery group used to have twelve cannons, but in a few days, we damaged five! Listening to the sound of the enemy's artillery these days, it seems that even the artillery positions have been withdrawn!"

As we talked, we looked at the flashing lights of our transport vehicles on the distant road, but before long, the sound of enemy planes sounded in the sky. Our air defense sentries along the road issued an alert, and the vehicles immediately turned off their lights and drove forward; the enemy planes blindly dropped a few flares like blind men, but before they could see the target, our anti-aircraft guns spewed out countless tongues of fire from the surrounding mountains. The enemy planes fled in embarrassment. Our vehicles still turned on their headlights and sped to the front line.

Li Yuheng told me: "Take the enemy's flares for example, the parachutes on them used to be made entirely of silk, then they were changed to cellophane, and now they are simply made of paper! The enemy is getting worse day by day! But what about us! From having no artillery to having artillery, from having artillery to increasing it to overwhelming the enemy's artillery; from air defense to shooting down airplanes, from shooting down airplanes to having airplanes...."

As we were talking, suddenly a few enemy searchlights flashed in front of us from the direction of the east coast, swinging left and right, as if looking for traces of our air force. Li Yuheng looked at the enemy's searchlights and said, "The days when the American devils will be drilling into air raid shelters are not far away!"

The enemy's morale was already very low, and with our strength growing day by day, the enemy became more and more panicked. A few days ago, our reconnaissance team accidentally fired two bursts of submachine guns in front of the enemy's position, and the enemy thought we were attacking. All kinds of firearms opened fire at the same time, and they fired for half an hour until they stopped shooting because they did not see our attacking troops. At the same time, the enemy's troop strength was insufficient, and the casualties were unusually large. Most of the troops were recruits, and many had never even fired a gun, so they huddled together in battle, with officers urging them from behind with guns, otherwise no one would be willing to go forward. In a recent battle, one of our soldiers said, "The enemy sticks out the muzzle of his gun, twists his neck, and turns his face away before daring to pull the trigger!"

Not long ago, when we captured a certain position, we found many corpses of Li's puppet soldiers on the position, all wearing many clothes and several pairs of socks. A prisoner said, "When we come to the position, we are just waiting to die. We eat the good things first and wear the good clothes first...." One of our soldiers asked him, "How can you fight like this?" He said, "Who wants to fight! Everyone wants to fly (meaning to escape), but they can't fly out...."

Some time ago, a soldier from a certain regiment of Li's puppet army came to surrender to us. The soldiers on the front-line position saw this enemy soldier waving a white flag and running towards our position, so they hurried to meet him. The first sentence the enemy soldier who came to surrender said when he arrived at our position was "Food!" Our soldiers immediately gave him two packs of biscuits and a can of canned pork, and he ate them all in one go. The soldiers asked him, "Are you full?" He said gratefully, "Today I had a full meal."

Then, this surrendering soldier asked, "Can you eat these things every day?" The soldiers told him, "You came a little late. We just ate dumplings." He looked at our soldiers, all with ruddy faces, wearing clean clothes, and the company commander even gave him a cigarette. He hesitated for a long time before saying a word: "The life of a soldier on their side is not a human life!"

He told us why he ran to our side. He said that he was a new recruit who was captured this April, and with him was a fellow villager of his. After the two were captured, they were sent to the front line. He said: "Three handfuls of rice a day, and seven shallots were issued a week. People were so hungry that they stole the Americans' biscuits, but if they were caught, they would be beaten half to death." Some time ago, his fellow villager ran away and was caught, shot, and his body was thrown on the hillside in front of them. He had to see the corpse of his fellow villager every day when he went out on guard. After thinking about it, running to this side was the only way to survive, but the enemy found him running to this side and shot at him. He said, "If I'm shot to death, I'll suffer less. If I'm not shot to death and I run over here, I'll live!"

The situation of our troops and the enemy is a clear contrast. At present, there are relatively few major battles on the Korean battlefield, and our troops have been confronting the enemy for a long time, but our soldiers are studying every day how to kill and injure more of the invading enemy's living forces. Whether in the command headquarters of the company, battalion, or division, one can often receive requests from the troops for combat missions in order to obtain peace in Korea as soon as possible; they are not only asking the superiors to approve the fight at that point, not only writing out letters of determination and plans to make contributions, but even their combat plans, and even the guarantees that they can complete the task, have been prepared in a mature manner.

After a team of a certain unit requested a combat mission, it was not approved because their fortifications had not been completed on time. When they heard this news, they dug the fortifications overnight and fought for the combat mission. During the battle, soldier Wang Shichang had injuries to his hands and feet. The team leader wanted him to go down, but he said, "I still have eyes, I will monitor the enemy for you and analyze the situation." But because he was bleeding too much, the team leader insisted that he go down, but he explained to the team leader: "When I first entered Korea, I was a new soldier. At that time, even if you asked me to monitor the enemy, I couldn't analyze the situation, but now, I am an old soldier and have experience in fighting American devils. There will be no mistake in analyzing the situation."

Indeed, in the Korean War of the past two years, our troops and our soldiers have experience in fighting American devils; victory encourages them, and experience enables them to strike the enemy with more confidence and more force.

The life of our troops is also improving day by day. Speaking of this, our soldiers can't help but recall the situation at the beginning of the Korean War. At that time, when the battle was tense, the soldiers on the front-line positions had "a handful of fried noodles and a handful of snow." Now, in the front-most team, because they can't cook their own meals, the comrades in the rear often send them wrapped dumplings, buns, and fried dough sticks, as well as homemade vinegar, homemade chili peppers, homemade tofu, etc. A certain regiment guarding the front line, although their position is within the range of the enemy's artillery fire, they have also planted more than eighty acres of vegetable gardens. Now the tomatoes are growing as big as fists. The soldier who planted the vegetable garden told me: "The land in Korea is really good. You can harvest as soon as you plant the seeds, without even fertilizing...." I strolled on the ridges of this vegetable garden and saw the craters left by the enemy's shells, but tender shoots of autumn cabbage had already grown in the craters.

The houses that our troops have built themselves are countless. Some of the houses are also built very exquisitely, with white wooden walls, some with floors and windows with gauze or cellophane that let in plenty of light. The rooms have some simple furnishings, wild flowers in artillery shell casings, and slogans written on waste newspapers saying "Keep Clean." I have seen the toilet of a certain machine gun company on the front line. It is all made of wooden planks from artillery shell boxes, and lime is sprinkled on the ground. Even on the hottest days, you can't find a single fly inside. Our soldiers live a very orderly life in the combat environment.

On the front line, I have also participated in evening parties of several troops. Some are soldiers' "soldiers performing for soldiers." They dance wonderful "tunnel dances" and "wiring dances," and sing allegro songs that they have composed themselves; some also have a small band. Sometimes the cultural troupe of the Korean People's Army joins us in a get-together. They sing the Korean folk song "Tractor," and our soldiers dance the "Yangko Dance"; sometimes our cultural troupe goes directly to the front-line team to perform, and even though there are only two or three soldiers present, they perform as if they were in front of thousands of spectators. Every evening, the positions are filled with singing and the sound of gongs and drums.

A few days ago, the comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteers returning delegation returned from the motherland, bringing with them a large number of comfort letters and comfort items from the motherland. They conveyed to the soldiers on the front line the motherland's people's remembrance of the Volunteers and the situation of the motherland's people's life and production and construction. When the soldiers saw a letter from an eighty-year-old mother, saw the photos sent to them by the young kindergarten children, and heard "Chairman Mao is very healthy!", the cheers and applause of the crowd drowned out the enemy's artillery fire.

One soldier finished reading the family letter that the delegation brought him. The letter said: "Father is carrying a thermos when he goes to the ground these days, and he is holding a flashlight when he adds grass to the livestock at night..." This soldier was so moved that he burst into tears. He said, "I haven't seen the motherland for more than two years, and it has been built better and better every day." Another soldier continued, "For more than two years, the motherland has been built better and better every day, and our victory is getting bigger and bigger!"

At night, I couldn't sleep lying down. I was thinking: Our troops and our soldiers use their own labor and wisdom to create victory and build their own "position homes." For more than two years, we have become stronger and stronger, and what the enemy has gained is one defeat after another--at this time, I heard a huge shout from the front line, which was our loudspeaker talking to the enemy. A comrade translated to me: We are shouting: "The nature of the war determines your failure..., we are carrying out a just war of anti-aggression, and we are bound to win...." There was no sound of gunfire from the enemy, they were listening quietly!

    朝鲜通讯正义是一定要胜利的
    张志民
    在朝鲜战场上，战斗在第一线的我方部队，对两年多以来敌我力量的消长，感觉得最为深刻。我们战士们的眼睛，天天都在看着敌人的变化，战士们常常把敌人的窘困、狼狈和惊恐作为谈笑的资料。当有人从后方到前沿的时候，战士们就一定要向你谈到这些。
    我初到前沿的一个夜晚，和一个名叫李玉衡的战士坐在坑道口聊天。阵地上不时的响着炮声，有的是从敌方打过来的，在我们的阵地前爆炸了；但是敌人的炮弹刚刚响过，李玉衡同志便对我说：“看着吧！咱们的炮快开始啦！”
    果然，他的话刚刚说完，我们的炮弹就像一排排火鸽子似的向敌方飞去了。接着，炮兵观察所就向后边指挥所报告情况：“我们的炮把敌炮阵地砸塌啦”！李玉衡同志对我说：“这叫作‘敌打我打’。敌人有的东西咱们都有，并且还比敌人的来得高明。敌人的炮打一千发不能打伤咱们一个人，可是咱们的炮一出口就不扑空。敌人的这个炮群以前是十二门炮，没有几天，让咱们打坏五门啦！这两天听敌炮出口的声音，像是连炮位都向后撤啦！”
    我们一边谈着，一边望着远处公路上我们运输汽车的闪闪的灯光，但没有好久在上空就响起了敌机的声音。沿路的我方防空哨发出了警报，汽车马上闭起灯来向前驶；敌机像瞎子一样盲目地投下了几颗照明弹，但没容它看到目标，我们的高射炮就从四面的山头上喷出了无数条火舌。敌机狼狈地逃窜了。我们的汽车仍然开起大灯，向前线奔驰着。
    李玉衡告诉我说：“就拿敌人的照明弹来说，过去上面的降落伞完全是拿绸子做的，以后就换成了玻璃纸的，这会干脆是纸的啦！敌人是一天不如一天啦！可是咱们呢！从没有炮到有炮，从有了炮增多到压倒敌人的炮；从防空到打飞机，从打飞机到了有飞机……。”
    谈着谈着，忽然眼前一闪，敌人的几支探照灯从东海岸的方向射起，左右摆动着，像是在寻找我们空军的行迹。李玉衡望着敌人的探照灯说：“美国鬼子钻防空洞的日子也不远啦！”
    敌军的士气本来就是很低的，又加以我们的力量一天天壮大起来，敌人就越来越恐慌了。几天以前，我们的一个侦察小组在敌人阵地前面因为走火响了两声冲锋枪，敌人以为我们进攻了，各种火器一齐开了火，一直打了半个小时，最后因为没有看见我们的攻击部队才停止了射击。同时，敌人兵力不足，而伤亡又异常之大，部队中绝大部分是新兵，有许多连枪都没有放过，所以在战斗时抱成一团，军官在后边用枪督促着，否则谁也不肯上前。最近一次战斗下来，我们的一个战士说：“敌人把枪口伸出来，扭着脖子背着脸才敢搂火哩！”
    不久以前，我们攻占某阵地时，发现阵地上有许多李伪军尸体，都是穿了很多衣服、几双袜子，一个俘虏说：“我们一上阵地来就是等死了，好东西先吃进肚里，好衣服先穿在身上……。”我们一个战士问他：“你们这样怎么能打仗呢？”他说：“谁愿意打仗呀！谁都想飞（逃跑之意），可是飞不出去……。”
    前些时，曾有李伪军某团的一个士兵来向我们投诚，前沿阵地上的战士们看到这个举着白旗的敌军士兵向我阵地跑来，就赶忙去接他。这个前来投诚的敌军士兵到了我们阵地上说的第一句话就是“吃饭！”我们的战士马上给他拿了两包饼干，一盒罐头猪肉，他一气就把这些东西吃光了。战士们问他：“吃饱了没有？”他感激地说：“今天算吃了顿饱饭。”
    接着，这个投诚的士兵就问：“你们天天能吃上这些东西？”战士们告诉他说：“你来得晚了一点，我们刚才吃的是饺子。”他望着我们的战士个个都是红光满面，穿着干净的衣服，连长还给了他一支香烟，他蹩了半天才说出一句话：“在我们那边当兵的过的不是人的生活！”
    他向我们叙说他为什么要跑到我们这边来。他说：他是今年四月才被抓去的新兵，和他在一起的还有他的一个同乡。两个人被抓后就送到前线上来了。他说：“一天三把米，一星期发了七颗小葱，饿得人们去偷美国人的饼干，可是一捉住就得打个半死”。前些日子，他那个老乡逃跑被抓回来枪毙了，尸首就扔在他们前面的山坡上。他每天出去站岗都要看到他的老乡的尸首，想来想去只有跑到这边来才是活路，可是敌人发觉他往这边跑就开枪打他。他说：“打死了我少受点罪，打不死我跑过来就算活啦！”
    我们的部队和敌人方面的情况真是个鲜明的对照。目前在朝鲜战场上大的战斗比较少，我们的部队长期和敌人对峙着，但是我们的战士却在天天研究着如何更多地杀伤进犯敌人的有生力量。不论是在连营或师团的指挥部，都常常可以收到部队为了早日得到朝鲜的和平而要求战斗任务的请求书；他们不仅仅是要求上级批准打那一点，不仅仅是写出了决心书和立功计划，而且连他们的战斗方案，连他们可以完成任务的保证条件都一一作了成熟的准备。
    某部队的一个小组请求战斗任务后，因为他们的工事还没有按时完成而未被批准，当他们听到了这个消息就连夜把工事挖好，争到了战斗任务。在战斗时，战士王世昌手脚都挂了彩，组长要他下去，他说：“我还有眼睛，我给你们监视敌人，分析情况。”但是因为他流血过多，组长一定要他下去，可是他给组长解释说：“刚入朝鲜那会我是个新战士，那会你让我监视敌人我也分析不出个情况来，可是这会，我是个老战士了，有了打美国鬼子的经验，分析情况错不了。”
    的确，在近两年来的朝鲜战争中，我们的部队，我们的战士都有打美国鬼子的经验；胜利鼓舞着他们，经验使他们能更有把握、更有力地来打击敌人。
    我们部队的生活，也一天天在改善中。说到这一点时，我们的战士们总不免要回忆起进入朝鲜作战的初期的情况，那时在战斗紧张的时候，前沿阵地的战士们是“一把炒面一把雪”，现在在阵地最前面的小组，因为不能自己做饭，后边的同志们常常把包好的饺子、包子和油条送到前边去，还有自己做的醋，自己种的辣椒，自己做的豆腐等等。守卫在第一线的某团，虽然他们的阵地是在敌人炮火威力圈之内，但是他们还种了八十多亩菜园，现在西红柿长得像拳头一样大了。种菜园的战士告诉我：“朝鲜的地真好，下上种子就能收，连粪都不用上……。”我在这菜园的田畦上踱着，看到敌人炮弹打下的弹坑，但是在弹坑里已经又长了秋白菜的嫩芽了。
    我们部队自己盖起的房子是难以计算的。有些房子并且盖得十分讲究，墙壁都是白白的木板，有的还有地板和糊着纱布或玻璃纸的光线十分充足的窗子。室内都有些简单的陈设，用炮弹壳插着野花，用废报纸写着“保持清洁”的标语。我看过最前沿的某机枪连的厕所，全部是用炮弹箱的木板做成的，地上洒着石灰，就是最热的天气，里面连一个苍蝇都找不到。我们的战士在战斗的环境中过着十分有秩序的生活。
    在前沿上我还参加过好几个部队的晚会，有的是战士们的“兵演兵”，他们跳着精彩的“坑道舞”、“架线舞”，唱着自己编的快板；有的还有个小小的乐队。有时是朝鲜人民军的文工团和我们联欢，他们唱着朝鲜的民歌“拖拉机”，我们的战士跳起“秧歌舞”；有时我们的文工团直接到前沿小组去演唱，虽然在场的只有两三个战士，但是他们也像在千百观众前面一样的演唱着。每到傍晚，阵地上是歌声四起，锣鼓喧天。
    几天之前，志愿军归国代表团的同志们由祖国回来了，并从祖国带来了大批的慰问信和慰问品。他们向前线的战士们传达了祖国人民对志愿军的怀念以及祖国人民的生活和生产建设的情形。当战士们看到了一位八十岁老妈妈的来信，看到幼儿园小弟弟送给他们的照片，听到“毛主席很健康！”时，大家的欢呼声和掌声把敌人的炮声都压倒了。
    有一个战士看完了代表团给他带来的家信，信上说：“父亲这会下地是提着暖水壶，夜里给牲口添草是拿着手电棒……”这个战士感动得流泪了，他说：“两年多没见祖国的面，建设得一天比一天好了。”另一个战士接着说：“两年多祖国建设得一天比一天好了，咱们的胜利也一天比一天大了！”
    夜里，我躺着总也睡不着，我在想着：我们的部队，我们的战士用自己的劳动和智慧创造了胜利，建设着自己的“阵地之家”。两年多来我们是愈战愈强了，而敌人所获得的是一次又一次的惨败——这时，听到前沿上发出了一阵巨大的喊声，是我们的扩音机向敌人喊话了。一个同志给我翻译说：我们在喊：“战争的性质决定了你们的失败……，我们进行的是正义的反侵略战争，是一定要胜利的……。”敌方并没有传来枪炮声，他们是在静静地听着哩！
