Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - According to a Tokyo broadcast on the 19th, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shinichi Shibusawa announced at 2:30 PM on the 19th to the Japanese delegates seeking passports to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference that the Japanese government has decided not to issue them passports. Several hours before this, the Yoshida government instructed a group of thug elements to beat the Japanese peace delegates who were applying for passports at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Yoshida government had long been determined to obstruct Japanese delegates from attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. In early September, officials of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already notified that passports would not be issued to Japanese peace delegates. Japanese peace advocates resolutely opposed this measure and filed a protest. On September 12th, Japanese Foreign Minister Katsuo Okazaki again stated that a response on the issue of issuing passports would be given before the 20th. On the 18th, Japanese peace delegates Masaharu Hatanaka and 30 others went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request a reply. They waited until noon on the 19th, when the Japanese reactionaries instructed a large number of thug elements to break into the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and beat the peace delegates, injuring one of them. After committing these atrocities, these thug elements swaggered away. Subsequently, Shinichi Shibusawa announced that passports would not be issued, citing the "reason" for not issuing passports as being that the governments of the United States and Australia had also decided not to issue passports to their peace delegates. These measures and so-called reasons of the Yoshida government fully expose the ugly face of the Yoshida government in faithfully implementing the policies of its American master, being hostile to peace, and being hostile to the Japanese people and the people of Asian and Pacific countries.

It is common knowledge that the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is for representatives of the peace aspirations of 1.6 billion people to jointly discuss the important issues of defending peace in Asia and the Pacific in order to find appropriate solutions. The conference's noble purpose of safeguarding peace is fully in line with the interests and wishes of the people of Asia, the Pacific, and the world. It has already received widespread support from the people of all countries, as can be fully demonstrated by the enthusiasm shown by the vast people of all countries in supporting the declaration of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, actively carrying out preparatory work, and electing representatives. The Yoshida government's attitude of obstructing and sabotaging the peace conference can only show that it is a government that opposes the development of Asia, the Pacific, and the world towards the path of peace, and is a government that faithfully implements the war policy of the United States and develops towards the path of militarism. It is no accident that Yoshida himself recently openly declared that he wants to "lead Asia" with the support of the United States. The Yoshida government's measures of openly antagonizing the peace aspirations and demands of the people of Asian and Pacific countries have aroused great indignation and opposition from the people of all countries.

### 日本政府竟宣布拒发和平代表出国护照  并指使特务分子殴打向外务省请发护照的和平代表

    日本政府竟宣布拒发和平代表出国护照
    并指使特务分子殴打向外务省请发护照的和平代表
    【新华社二十日讯】据东京十九日广播，日本外务省次官澁泽信一已在十九日下午二时半向要求出国护照的出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本代表宣布，日本政府决定不发出国护照给他们。在此以前数小时，吉田政府指使一批特务分子殴打了向外务省要求出国护照的日本和平代表。
    吉田政府早就决心阻挠日本代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。九月初，日本外务省官员就已通告不发出国护照给日本和平代表。日本和平人士坚决反对这一措施并提出抗议。九月十二日，日本外相冈崎胜男又表示对发出国护照的问题将在二十日以前给予答复。十八日日本和平代表畑中政春等三十人到外务省要求答复。他们一直等到十九日中午，日本反动派竟指示大批特务分子冲入外务省殴打了和平代表，代表中一人受伤。这些特务分子在大肆行凶之后，即扬长而去。接着，澁泽信一就宣布不发出国护照，并举出不发出国护照的“理由”是美国和澳大利亚等国政府都决定不发出国护照给它们的和平代表。吉田政府的这些措施和所谓的理由，完全暴露了吉田政府忠诚执行其美国主人的政策，而与和平为敌、与日本人民及亚洲和太平洋各国人民为敌的丑恶面目。
    人所共知，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，是为了使代表十六亿人民的和平意愿的代表，共同讨论当前保卫亚洲及太平洋和平的重要问题，以便觅致适当的解决途径。会议的这种维护和平的崇高目的是完全符合亚洲、太平洋及全世界人民的利益与愿望的，它已经得到各国人民的广泛支持，这从各国广大人民拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的宣言、积极进行筹备工作及选举代表所表现的热情中，可以得到充分的证明。吉田政府对于和平会议采取阻挠破坏的态度，只能说明它是反对亚洲、太平洋及全世界向和平道路上发展的政府，是忠实地执行美国的战争政策向军国主义道路上发展的政府。吉田本人最近曾公开宣称要在美国扶植之下来“领导亚洲”，这决不是偶然的。吉田政府公开敌视亚洲及太平洋各国人民的和平愿望及要求的措施，业已引起各国人民的极大愤慨和反对。
