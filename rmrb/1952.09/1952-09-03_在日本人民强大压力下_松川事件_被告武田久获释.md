Under Strong Pressure from the Japanese People
    “Matsukawa Incident” Defendant Hisashi Takeda Released

    [From Our Newspaper] Hisashi Takeda, one of the innocent defendants in the “Matsukawa Incident,” was released on bail on July 7th.
    Hisashi Takeda was the chairman of the Fukushima branch of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union. He was the healthiest of the twenty innocent defendants illegally arrested by the US-Japanese reactionaries in the August 1949 "Matsukawa Incident." However, after three years of inhuman torture in prison, he contracted a serious lung disease. After learning that Hisashi Takeda was ill, the Japanese people launched a struggle to demand his release on bail. Under the strong demands and pressure from the broad masses of the Japanese people, the Sendai High Court was finally forced to grant bail to Hisashi Takeda on July 7th.
    To date, four of the twenty innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" have been released on bail: Sen Saito, Hajime Sato, Hisashi Takeda, and Sonoko Nikaido.

    在日本人民强大压力下
    “松川事件”被告武田久获释
    【本报讯】“松川事件”的无辜被告之一武田久，已于七月七日保释出狱。
    武田久是日本国营铁路工会福岛支部委员长。在一九四九年八月“松川事件”二十名无辜被告被美日反动派非法逮捕时，他是身体最为健壮的一个。但是，三年来由于在狱中遭受到非人的磨折，以致罹染严重的肺病。日本人民知道武田久染病后，就展开了要求保释他的斗争。在广大的日本人民强烈要求和压力下，仙台高等裁判所终于在七月七日被迫准许保释武田久出狱。
    迄今为止，“松川事件”二十名无辜被告中，已有斋藤千、佐藤一、武田久、二阶堂园子四人保释出狱。
