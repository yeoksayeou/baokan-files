Three Major International Organizations Support the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference

    The Secretariat of the International Student Union recently issued a letter to students in Asia and the Pacific regions, calling on them to actively participate in the preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, organize extensive discussions in every place where there are students to understand the significance of the Peace Conference, strengthen communication among students, unite in the struggle for peace, launch a movement on a broader scale to demand that the five major powers conclude a peace pact, and demand an end to the Korean War.

    Prior to this, the Secretariat of the World Peace Council and the Executive Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions also called on peace committees and trade union organizations in various countries to actively support, promote, and organize the preparatory work for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.

    The active support of these three major international organizations for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference shows that the convening of this conference is not only warmly supported by the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific regions, but also supported by peace-loving people all over the world.

The People's Movement to Defend Peace in Southeast Asian Countries is Rising

    The movement of people in Southeast Asian countries to prepare for participation in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has reached a climax. Preparations for convening the Third All-India Peace Conference and participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference have been widely launched throughout India. Peace conferences have been held in Patiala and the East Punjab States Union, Bihar Province, Uttar Pradesh Province, West Bengal Province, and other places. Trade unions in Bombay are raising funds for the travel expenses of representatives from these trade unions to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Workers in Ludhiana, Chandigarh, and other places have announced that they will offer gifts to the Peace Conference. The people of Vietnam and Ceylon have elected delegations to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The people of Burma have also elected candidates to attend the conference and have chosen some official representatives. The work of people in Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Nepal, and other countries to prepare for participation in the Peace Conference is also being carried out enthusiastically.

    The scale of the work of the people in Southeast Asian countries to prepare for participation in the Peace Conference is unprecedented, which shows that the strength of the increasingly awakened Asian people to oppose imperialist enslavement and defend the peace and security of Asia is powerful.

The People of Australia and New Zealand Warmly Support the Peace Conference

    The work of the people of Australia and New Zealand to elect representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is being stepped up. A series of mass rallies were held in various parts of Australia. After the representatives who participated in the Peace Conference preparatory meeting returned home, they were warmly welcomed by the people in various places when they gave lectures and reports. New Zealand has recently elected representatives to participate in the Peace Conference and has widely launched publicity work.

    The American aggressors, through aggressive military agreements, are increasingly pushing the people of Australia and New Zealand into the abyss of war. Only by uniting with the people of various countries in Asia and the Pacific regions to strengthen the struggle to defend peace can the people of Australia and New Zealand liberate themselves from the war chariot of the United States.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备情况简讯
    三大国际组织支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    国际学生联合会秘书处最近发表告亚洲及太平洋区域学生书，号召他们积极参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作，在每一个有学生的地方组织广泛的讨论，了解和平会议的意义，并加强学生之间通信工作，在争取和平的斗争中团结起来，在更广泛的规模上开展一个要求五大国缔结和平公约的运动，并要求停止朝鲜战争。
    在此以前，世界和平理事会书记处和世界工联执行局，也曾分别号召各国的和平委员会组织和工会组织，积极支持、推动与组织亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作。
    这三大国际组织的积极支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，说明这个会议的召开不独得到亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的热烈拥护，而且得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持。
    东南亚各国人民保卫和平运动日益高涨
    东南亚各国人民筹备参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的运动已进入高潮。印度各地广泛地展开了召开第三届全印和平大会与参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备工作。巴地阿拉与东旁遮普土邦联盟、比哈尔省、北方省、西孟加拉省等地都召开了和平会议。孟买各工会正在筹募这些工会的代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的路费。卢德希那、昌的迦等地的工人宣布他们要向和平会议献赠礼物。越南人民和锡兰人民都选出了代表团出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。缅甸人民也选出了出席大会的代表候选人，并选出了部分正式代表。巴基斯坦、印尼、泰国、高棉、寮国、尼泊尔等国人民筹备参加和平会议的工作也热烈展开了。
    东南亚各国人民筹备参加和平会议的工作规模是空前的，这表明了日益觉醒的亚洲人民反对帝国主义奴役、保卫亚洲的和平与安全的力量是强大的。
    澳、新两国人民热烈拥护和平会议
    澳大利亚和新西兰两国人民推选代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作正加紧进行。澳大利亚各地举行了一连串的群众大会，参加和平会议筹备会议的代表归国以后在各地讲演报告时，受到了各地人民的热烈欢迎。新西兰最近已选出参加和平会议的代表，并广泛展开了宣传工作。
    美国侵略者通过侵略性的军事协定正日益加紧地把澳、新两国人民推向战争深渊里去，澳、新两国人民只有和亚洲、太平洋区域各国人民团结起来加强保卫和平的斗争，才能把自己从美国的战车下解放出来。
