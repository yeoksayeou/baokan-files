    Unprecedented Harvest in Hami County, Xinjiang
    To the Editor: Hami County, a region in Xinjiang Province inhabited by fraternal ethnic groups, has achieved an unprecedented harvest this year. In the past, Hami County's agricultural output was very low, and severe grain shortages occurred every year. After liberation, the lives of the masses gradually improved, and their enthusiasm for production increased day by day. This year, the phenomenon of grain shortage has been completely reversed. This year, in Erxiang, Sanbao Erqu of the county, ordinary farmers harvested 400 to 500 jin of wheat per mu, and the highest yield of farmer Bai Jingui's wheat reached 902 jin per mu. According to preliminary statistics, the unit area yield of agricultural products in the county exceeded the original plan by more than 62.2 percent.

    This year's bumper harvest has reversed the county's historical situation of insufficient grain production. Last year, the county suffered a grain shortage and had to import 10 million jin of grain from other places, which cost 72 billion yuan in transportation fees. This year, the grain produced in the county, in addition to meeting local needs, can also have a surplus of more than 2 million jin. This not only improved the living standards of the masses, but also laid a solid foundation for fraternal ethnic groups to further develop the agricultural high-yield movement.

    The bumper harvest in Hami County is a great joyous event for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The old Hui peasant, Nuer, said: "I have lived for sixty-five years, and I have never seen such good crops as this year. In the past, a harvest of ten percent was considered the limit, but this year, a harvest of fifteen or sixteen percent is not uncommon. We should really thank Chairman Mao for bringing us infinite happiness."

    新疆哈密县获得空前丰收
    编辑同志：新疆省兄弟民族聚居地区的哈密县，今年农作物获得空前丰收。过去哈密县农产品的产量很低，年年发生严重的缺粮现象。解放后，群众生活逐渐改善，生产情绪日益提高；到了今年，已完全改变了缺粮的现象。今年该县三堡二区二乡一般农民每亩小麦收获四、五百斤，农民白金贵的小麦每亩最高产量达九百零二斤。据初步统计，全县农产品的单位面积产量，超过原来计划百分之六十二点二强。
    今年的丰收，扭转了该县历年来粮食生产不足的状况。去年该县缺粮，曾由外地调入粮食一千万斤，用去运费七百二十亿元；今年全县生产的粮食，除了供应当地需用外，还可剩余二百多万斤。这不但提高了群众的生活水平，并且为兄弟民族进一步开展农业丰产运动打下了有力的基础。
    哈密县的丰收，是新疆各族人民的一大喜事。回城区老农奴尔说：“我活了六十五岁，从来没见过像今年这样的好庄稼，过去收十分认为到头了，今年收十五、六分还不算希罕，真该感谢毛主席给我们带来了无限的幸福。”    春平  檀英
