    Shanghai's fourteen state-owned cotton textile factories have completed the promotion of the light sizing method for cotton cloth ahead of schedule. Among them, the Eighth and Nineteenth factories carried out key promotion work on July 23rd, the Fourth, Tenth, and Eleventh factories completed the promotion work by the end of July, and the other nine factories also completed the promotion work before August 19th. The dates on which each factory completed the promotion work were 30 to 60 days earlier than the date decided by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, saving a large amount of wealth for the country.
    After the factories promoted the light sizing method, the yarn breakage rate on the looms generally decreased. For example, in state-owned Shanghai Fifth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Sixteenth, and Twentieth cotton textile factories, the breakage rate decreased by 10% to 40% after the light sizing method was promoted. If the operation method is correctly mastered and the humidity in the workshop is reasonably reduced, the breakage rate can be further reduced. The output of some factories also increased after the light sizing method was promoted. The output of cloth in the Eleventh Cotton Textile Factory increased by 2% compared to before. The phenomenon of fluffing when tearing defective cloth has also been avoided, and there is very little fluffing when tearing defective cloth to 15 inches in general. Workers in the Sixth Factory who tear defective cloth reflected: "Light-sized yarn is smoother than heavy-sized yarn, so it does not fluff."
　　During the promotion process, the Party Committee of the East China Textile Administration Bureau attached great importance to this work, and all factories carried out in-depth mobilization and education, and organized workers and technicians to jointly study and discuss and solve technical difficulties. Therefore, the promotion work could be successfully completed. The Shanghai Municipal Textile Industry Advanced Work Method Promotion Committee is currently organizing state-owned cotton textile factories to exchange promotion experience and study and solve the technical problems that still exist in the implementation of light sizing, in order to further improve the quality and output of cloth. At the same time, the committee is organizing state-owned, joint state-private, and private textile and dyeing factories that have not yet promoted light sizing to carry out promotion work in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    上海十四个国营棉纺织厂
    提前完成棉布轻浆法的推广工作
    上海市十四个国营棉纺织厂，已提前完成推广棉布轻浆法工作。其中第八、第十九两个厂在七月二十三日即进行重点推广工作，第四、第十、第十一三个厂在七月底完成推广工作，其他九个厂也都在八月十九日前全部完成推广工作。各厂完成推广工作的日期，较中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会决定要推广的日期提前了三十天到六十天，为国家节省了大量财富。
    各厂推广了轻浆法后，布机上纱的断头率一般都降低了。如国营上海第五、九、十、十一、十六、二十等棉纺织厂，推广轻浆法后，断头率都降低了百分之十到百分之四十。如果正确地掌握了操作法及合理降低车间湿度后，断头率还能降低。有些厂在推广轻浆法后产量也提高了。第十一棉纺织厂布的产量较前提高了百分之二。拆坏布时起毛的现象也已避免，一般拆到十五寸的坏布已很少起毛。第六厂的拆坏布工人反映：“轻浆纱比重浆纱光滑，所以不会起毛。”
　　在推广过程中，华东纺织管理局党委会十分重视这项工作，各厂也都进行了深入的动员教育，并组织工人、技术人员共同研究讨论，解决技术上的困难。因而推广工作能够顺利完成。上海市纺织工业先进工作法推广委员会，目前正组织各国营棉纺织厂交流推广经验，研究解决实行轻浆中尚存在的技术问题，以求进一步提高布的质量、产量。同时，该委员会正有计划有步骤地组织尚未推广轻浆的公营、公私合营及私营纺织厂、染织厂进行推广工作。
