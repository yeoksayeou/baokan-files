The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to officially open in Beijing soon. At present, representatives from most countries in the Asian and Pacific regions have arrived in Beijing one after another, or are on their way to Beijing. This fact once again fully demonstrates that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference represents the peace aspirations of the people of all countries and has received enthusiastic support from the people of all countries. However, the reactionary Japanese government, disregarding the good wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people, initially adopted shameful tactics of repeated delays in response to the requests of Japanese representatives participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference for passports to leave the country. Then, on the 19th of this month, it officially announced its refusal to issue passports, and a few hours before this shameless official announcement, it even adopted despicable and base fascist means, instructing a group of secret agents to beat up Japanese peace representatives who went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request the issuance of passports. This blatant act of the reactionary Japanese government, which violates the peace demands of the Japanese people, has aroused the anger and opposition of peace-loving Japanese people and the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. The spokesman of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, in a statement issued on the 17th of this month, pointed out that the Japanese government's refusal or delay in issuing passports to Japanese peace representatives runs counter to the good wishes of the Japanese people. At the same time, it expressed warm sympathy and support for the efforts of the Japanese people to obtain passports to participate in the peace conference. This statement fully represents the firm will of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to strive for peace.

The spokesman of the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference pointed out in the statement: "The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is convened in accordance with the resolution of the Preparatory Meeting in June. As is known to all, it is to discuss issues related to the peace and security, national independence, economic exchange, and cultural exchange of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions. This noble purpose is in full compliance with the wishes and demands of all good people in the Asian and Pacific regions and the world." Facts have proven that what the Japanese people under the tyrannical rule of the United States urgently need today is to strive for peace and democracy, strive for national independence, and promote economic and cultural exchanges with the people of all countries. Therefore, the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is fully in line with the wishes and demands of the Japanese people. The base means adopted by the Yoshida reactionary government regarding the request of Japanese peace representatives to obtain passports fully proves that it hates peace and is an enemy of the peace-loving people of Japan. At the same time, it also shows its extreme fear of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. After concluding a separate "peace treaty" with the United States, the reactionary Japanese government is actively reviving militarist forces with the support and encouragement of the United States, attempting to stage a comeback, repeat aggression, and pose a serious threat to the peace and security of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. Its obstruction of Japanese peace representatives from coming to Beijing to attend the meeting is precisely because it fears that these representatives will expose and condemn its ambition to repeat aggression at the peace conference. The reactionary Japanese government not only has no remorse for the past aggressive acts of Japanese militarist forces, but also continues to be hostile to peace and even unscrupulously adopts a provocative attitude towards the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.

The Japanese Yoshida government fabricated a bunch of so-called "reasons" to defend their actions of refusing to issue passports to peace representatives, the most important of which is that the United States, the Philippines, and other countries have decided not to issue passports to peace representatives. This "reason" is obviously extremely absurd. This "reason" can only prove that the Japanese Yoshida government is a loyal servant of American imperialism, and like its master, it is extremely hostile to peace.

One fact is very clear. The Japanese Yoshida government has both refused to issue passports and instructed a group of secret agents to beat up peace representatives, which proves that the dark reactionary forces in Japan—the Japanese militarists—have reappeared in Japan. This is not only a serious warning to the peace-loving Japanese people, but also a serious warning to the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions and the world. From this, it can be seen how urgent the task of opposing the revival of Japanese militarism is for the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.

This provocative behavior of the Japanese reactionaries against peace is obviously instructed by its American master. The American aggressors habitually boast that the United States and its vassal states are so-called "free countries"; the facts now prove that their so-called "freedom" is a complete lie. It is the American and its vassal countries' running dog groups that are erecting iron curtains between the people of various countries to hinder and isolate the free exchanges of the people of various countries and prevent economic and cultural exchanges between the people of various countries. They not only impose blockades and embargoes on the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, but also do not give any freedom of action to their own people. From here, people can see more clearly the true face of the ruling groups of the United States and its vassal states. They also clamor about "peace," "freedom," and "democracy" on weekdays, but in reality, they say all the good words and do all the bad things. Their clamor is nothing but a shameless trick to deceive the good people. It is by relying on this kind of deceptive propaganda that they hinder the mutual understanding of the people of various countries and create a tense situation in the world, so as to facilitate their expansion of armaments and war preparations and provoke aggressive wars.

We believe that the heroic actions of the Japanese people in striving for peace will surely receive the unanimous sympathy and support of all peace-loving, kind, and upright people. In the current struggle to obtain passports to leave the country, the Japanese people will surely be more united, distinguish between friends and enemies, rely on the strength of domestic unity and international unity, and continue to work hard to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and strive for Japan's independence, peace, and democracy.

The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is a major victory for peace, and all obstruction and sabotage activities of the enemies of peace are in vain. They can only further expose their sinister and shameful face of being hostile to peace in front of the people of the world, and they can only be more opposed and spurned by the Japanese people and the people of the world.

### 斥日本政府拒发护照  破坏和平的卑劣行为

    斥日本政府拒发护照  破坏和平的卑劣行为
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，不久就要在北京正式开幕了。现在亚洲及太平洋区域多数国家的代表，业已陆续到达北京，或正在来北京的途中。这一事实，再次充分说明亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表着各国人民的和平愿望，得到了各国人民的热烈拥护和支持。可是，日本反动政府竟不顾日本广大人民的这种善良愿望，对日本参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的代表领取出国护照的要求，始则采取一再拖延的可耻手段，继之于本月十九日正式宣布拒绝发给出国护照，并在这种无耻的正式宣布之前数小时，竟采取卑鄙下流的法西斯手段，指使一批特务分子殴打到外务省要求签发护照的日本和平代表。日本反动政府这种公然违背日本人民和平要求的卑劣举动，已经激起爱好和平的日本人民以及亚洲和太平洋区域各国人民的愤怒和反对。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会发言人在本月十七日发表的谈话中，便曾指出日本政府拒绝或拖延发给日本和平代表以出国护照的行为，是与日本人民的善良愿望背道而驰的；同时，对于日本人民为参加和平会议而争取出国护照的努力，表示热烈的同情和支持。这个谈话，是完全代表了亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为和平而奋斗的坚定意志的。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会发言人在谈话中指出：“亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议乃是根据六月筹备会议的决议召开的。举世共知，它所要讨论的乃是有关亚洲及太平洋区域人民和平安全、民族独立、经济交流和文化交流等问题，这种崇高的目的是完全符合于亚洲及太平洋区域和全世界所有善良人民的意愿和要求的。”事实证明，今天在美国专横统治下的日本人民所迫切需要的，正是争取和平与民主，争取民族独立，促进与各国人民间的经济交流和文化交流。因此，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，更是完全符合于日本人民的愿望和要求的。吉田反动政府对于日本和平代表领取出国护照的要求所采取的卑劣手段，充分证明它仇视和平，是日本爱好和平人民的敌人；同时，更表明它对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的极端恐惧。日本反动政府在与美国缔结单独“和约”之后，正在美国的扶持和鼓励之下积极复活军国主义势力，妄图卷土重来，重演侵略，造成对亚洲及太平洋区域各国的和平与安全的严重威胁。它阻止日本和平代表到北京来开会，正是害怕这些代表在和平会议上揭露和谴责它重演侵略的野心。日本反动政府不但对于日本军国主义势力过去的侵略行为毫无悔祸之心，而且继续与和平为敌，甚至肆无忌惮地对亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民采取挑衅态度，这是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民决不能容忍的。
    日本吉田政府捏造了一大堆的所谓“理由”来辩护他们拒绝发护照给和平代表的行动，其中最主要的一个“理由”就是说美国、菲律宾等国已决定不发给和平代表以出国护照。这个“理由”显然是极端荒谬的。这个“理由”只能证明日本吉田政府是美国帝国主义的忠顺的奴仆，它和它的主子一样是极端仇视和平的。
    有一个事实是十分明显的。日本吉田政府既拒绝签发出国护照，又指使一批特务殴打和平代表，这就证明日本的黑暗反动势力——日本军国主义者已经千真万确地在日本重新出现了。这不仅是对于爱好和平的日本人民的严重警告，而且是对于亚洲和太平洋区域各国以及全世界人民的严重警告。由此可见，反对日本军国主义复活这个任务，对于亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民说来，是如何的紧迫了。
    日本反动派对和平的这种挑衅行为，显然是受它的美国主子指使的。美国侵略者惯常吹嘘说，美国及其仆从国家是所谓“自由国家”；现在的事实恰好证明他们的所谓“自由”，是彻头彻尾的谎言。在各国人民之间树立铁幕，以阻碍和隔绝各国人民自由交往，阻止各国人民间经济与文化交流的正是美国及其仆从各国的走狗集团。它们不但对苏联、中国以及各人民民主国家实行封锁禁运，就是对其本国的人民也不给予任何的行动自由。从这里人们更可以看清楚美国及其仆从国家统治集团的真面目。他们平日也喧嚷甚么“和平”、“自由”、“民主”，实际上他们是好话说尽，坏事做尽。他们的这种喧嚷，不过是欺骗善良人民的无耻伎俩。他们就是凭借着这种欺骗宣传，来阻碍各国人民的互相了解，制造世界的紧张局势，以便利于它们扩军备战，挑动侵略战争。
    我们相信，日本人民争取和平的英勇行动，一定会得到所有爱好和平的、善良正直的人们的一致同情和支持。在目前争取出国护照的斗争中，日本人民必将更加团结一致，分清敌友，依靠着国内团结和国际团结的力量，为反对日本军国主义复活，争取日本的独立、和平与民主而继续努力。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开是和平的重大胜利，和平的敌人的一切阻碍和破坏活动，都是徒劳的。它们只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露自己与和平为敌的凶恶的可耻的面目，它们只能更加遭受到日本人民和全世界人民的反对和唾弃。
