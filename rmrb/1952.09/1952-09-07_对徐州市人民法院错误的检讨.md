    Self-Criticism of Errors by the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court
    Zhang Guangzhong, Mayor of Xuzhou Municipality
    The errors of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court are quite serious. As the People's Daily pointed out, this organization has become corrupt and degenerate.
    The reason why the errors of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court could develop to such a serious extent is that, in addition to the leadership of the court and the former president Wang Jingwu bearing responsibility, the serious bureaucracy in the leadership of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government is also a very important reason. Among them, I should bear some responsibility for the problems of the court.
    The serious bureaucracy in the leadership of myself and the Municipal People's Government is primarily manifested in our complete ignorance of certain major problems in the court. The Xuzhou Municipal People's Court, headed by Wang Jingwu, completely controlled the actual power of judgment in the hands of bad elements and old judicial personnel. They oppressed the working people and disregarded the interests of the state; when handling cases of counter-revolutionaries persecuting the people, they did not distinguish between the enemy and us, treated everyone "equally," and even shielded counter-revolutionaries; they were even more indulgent and protective towards illegal bourgeois elements, showing them great concern; when handling marriage cases, they supported the feudal order. They took bribes and perverted justice, committing all kinds of evil. During the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries movement, Wang Jingwu, because he accepted bribes, only sentenced the traitor Song Chaoquan, who killed the director of the political department of our Canal Detachment and 28 others, to seven years in prison. Wang Jingwu once introduced a job to the counter-revolutionary criminal Xia Qianzhi. After Xia was arrested, Wang Jingwu told the director of the prison: "Xia is my old colleague, please take care of him." In the end, Xia was released from his handcuffs and appointed as a custodian. In the case of illegal capitalists such as Gao Rongzhen of the Xuzhou cotton textile industry disrupting the Trade Union Law and beating Wang Yanrong of the Trade Union Law Inspection Group, the court judge Li Xusheng, when handling the case, acquitted Gao and others on the grounds that they could still "confess." Mao Ji Paint Shop deceived Li Fanchi, a farmer from Xiaoxian County, by passing off mud as paint. Li went to the court to sue, but the person in charge, Wu Peishen, listened to the sophistry of the illegal capitalists and instead detained Li for two months. In the case of Rui Ji Construction Factory defrauding public funds from the Bengbu Railway Branch Bureau, the court did not accept the suggestion to seal up the factory's property. The verdict was given in March, but it was not executed until October. As a result, both the defendant and the guarantor ran away, making it impossible to recover the more than 300,000 kilograms of rice defrauded from the state. In the case of Li Hanzhao's abuse of his wife to death, the court official Liu Ganchen believed that the matter should be "settled amicably" and left it unresolved. In the case of Fan Xiaoni accusing Zhang Mingfa of rape and infanticide, the judge Zhang Lindong, when accepting the case, dismissed it with the words "an old man of sixty cannot possibly commit rape," acquitted the defendant, and sentenced the plaintiff to six months in prison. Handling a case required as many as fifteen procedures. Judicial personnel could arbitrarily summon, detain, and sentence people. The basis for their judgments was not the program, policies, laws, and decrees of the People's Government, but the Kuomintang's "Six Codes." All of these, together with the materials already revealed by the People's Daily and many other similar situations that are difficult to describe in detail, fully demonstrate that the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court is no longer a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, but a "den of sin that oppresses revolutionary people, rapes women, takes bribes and perverts justice, and shields counter-revolutionaries and illegal bourgeois elements" (see the People's Daily's brief commentary on political and legal work on August 19). The losses it has caused to the state and the people are incalculable. However, we remained unaware of such serious problems in the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court before the "Three-Anti" movement, and we were even unaware of the serious situation of the former president Wang Jingwu himself concealing his history, taking bribes and perverting justice, using drugs, shielding counter-revolutionaries, and feigning compliance and deceiving superiors in his work.
    Our bureaucracy did not stop there; more seriously, although we had noticed some problems in the leadership and work of the court, we did not treat them with a serious attitude and give them appropriate handling and criticism. It was common for the court to detain people casually, detain people who should not have been sentenced for several months, and misjudge cases. We discovered some problems and instructed the court to handle them correctly, but because we did not check and supervise, we did not know whether the court had implemented them or not. In particular, we did not personally or organize a certain force to inspect the work of the court, so the court's errors could not be corrected in time, which also encouraged the audacity of those bad elements.
    The illegal and undisciplined behavior of Wang Jingwu himself and other bad elements was not unknown to anyone; during the "Three-Anti" movement, the court staff made ruthless exposures. The reason why it had not been exposed for a long time in the past was mainly because our democratic style was insufficient. We failed to contact the comrades in the court in a timely manner, listen to their opinions on the leadership and work of the court, and we did not pay attention to certain important clues. For example, Wang Jingwu had repeatedly requested to transfer the court's personnel secretary, and even maliciously attacked her continuously at the beginning of the "Three-Anti" movement, requesting her dismissal and investigation twice. Although we felt that there were some problems at the time, we did not agree to Wang Jingwu's request, nor did we delve into the situation and talk to the personnel secretary. Today, the facts prove that the differences between the two of them and the personnel secretary's opinions were basically correct, and she also knew a lot of problems in the court.
    Our understanding of the People's Court as a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship, a weapon to fight against counter-revolutionaries, and a power organ to protect the interests of the people and ensure production and construction was not clear, and we did not pay as much attention to it as we did to the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, we did not pay enough attention to the allocation of cadres, and the leadership of the court's work was basically neglected. Except for major movements such as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the clearing of backlog cases, which were directly led by us, we rarely intervened in normal times. We neither specifically discussed the work of the court, nor inspected the work, nor conducted a detailed review of the character, history, and background of the cadres. We knew very well that the court, from its leadership to certain judges, had serious old legal viewpoints, but apart from pointing out in principle during the rectification campaign in 1950 that it should be a key focus of rectification, we never intervened again. Our weak leadership and lack of attention to the allocation of cadres in the court was also a very important reason for the court's errors.
    The great "Three-Anti" movement severely struck our bureaucracy, and the errors of the court were gradually exposed. After discovering the serious situation of the Municipal People's Court, we took careful, resolute, and serious measures. In order to clarify the situation, we sent the director of the Personnel Department of the Municipal People's Government to personally check the materials. After verifying that the materials were true, we immediately sent a strong and effective work team to help rectify the court organization. Under the leadership and direct control of the Xuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Xuzhou Municipal People's Government, and with the efforts of the dispatched work team and the court staff, the errors of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court, headed by Wang Jingwu, have been fully exposed after more than a month. We immediately arrested and prosecuted Wang Jingwu according to the Party's policies and the demands of the masses, and dismissed and investigated Yang Zhongxuan, the former director of the civil affairs department, Feng Ziao, the former deputy director of the criminal affairs department, and Liu Ganchen, the former deputy president of the suburban sub-court, who had taken bribes and perverted justice. Other elements who had taken bribes and perverted justice, and violated laws and regulations were also given criminal and administrative sanctions, respectively.
    On the other hand, we have also transferred a group of strong and effective cadres to enrich the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court. Therefore, after the "Three-Anti" movement, the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court has taken on a new look.
    Recently, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's instructions on reforming judicial work, we have thoroughly reorganized the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court organizationally. In addition to the personnel who have already been dealt with in the "Three-Anti" movement, we have also introduced or made other arrangements for some personnel who are not suitable for judicial work; we have absorbed some workers and women to participate in the work of the People's Court. We have initially reformed some old litigation procedures, removed the gatekeepers, strengthened the work of the inquiry office, and improved the waiting room. Currently, we are combining the summary of the court's work and the inspection of old cases to eliminate the old legal views of judicial personnel. This work has achieved some results and has been well received by the broad masses of the people. On this basis, under the leadership of the Party and the higher-level People's Government, and in accordance with the spirit of the central government's reform of judicial work, we will accept the painful lessons of the past and strive to do a good job in the reform of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court, so as to make the court a truly weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship.
    The errors of the Xuzhou Municipal People's Court are serious, and the lessons are profound. In addition to accepting the lessons of this incident, the more important issue lies in strengthening the theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and overcoming our serious shortcomings of not being principled enough in our work, lacking a central focus, lacking a focus, and being trapped in busy affairs all day long by improving our political and theoretical level.

    对徐州市人民法院错误的检讨
    徐州市人民政府市长　张光中
    徐州市人民法院的错误是相当严重的。正如人民日报所指出的那样，这个组织已经腐烂变质了。
    徐州市人民法院的错误所以能够发展到这样严重，除法院的领导及前院长王景武应负责任外，徐州市人民政府在领导上的严重官僚主义也是很重要的原因。其中我对法院的问题应负一定的责任。
    我和市人民政府领导上的严重的官僚主义，首先表现在对法院的某些重大问题一无所知。以王景武为首的徐州市人民法院，审判实权完全操在坏分子、旧司法人员之手。他们欺压劳动人民，漠视国家利益；处理反革命分子迫害人民的案件时，敌我不分，“平等”对待，甚至包庇反革命；对不法资产阶级分子更是放纵包庇，关心备至；处理婚姻案件时则支持封建秩序。他们贪赃卖法，无恶不作。在镇压反革命运动中，王景武因为收受了贿赂，对杀害我运河支队政治部主任以下二十九人的汉奸宋朝权只判七年徒刑。王景武曾给反革命犯夏谦芝介绍职业，夏犯被捕后，王景武又告诉犯人教育所长说：“夏某是我的老同事，要照顾些。”最后，夏犯被去掉手镣，提出来当了保管。徐州市棉织业不法资本家高荣真等破坏工会法，并殴伤工会法检查小组王言荣一案，法院审判员李旭升在处理时竟以高犯等尚能“坦白”为理由，判以无罪。茂记颜料店以泥土冒充颜料欺骗萧县农民李凡池，李至法院控诉，承办人员吴培身听信了不法资本家的狡辩，反将李扣押两月。瑞记营造厂诈骗蚌埠铁路分局公款案，法院不接受建议，不去查封该厂财产，三月份判决，十月份执行，结果被告和保人一齐跑掉，使国家被骗的大米三十余万斤无法追偿。李汉兆虐待其妻致死案，法院承办人员刘干忱认为应“息事宁人”，不了了之。范小妮控告张明发强奸并杀婴一案，审判员张临东在受理时竟以“六十老人不可能强奸”为词，判被告无罪，反判原告徒刑半年。审理一个案件要多到十五道手续。审判人员都可以随意传讯，随意拘押，随意判决。他们判案的根据不是人民政府的纲领、政策、法律、法令，而是国民党的“六法全书”。所有这些和人民日报已经揭发出来的材料以及其他许多难以尽述的类似情况，充分说明徐州市人民法院已经不是人民民主专政的武器，它是“欺压革命人民、强奸妇女、贪赃枉法、包庇反革命、包庇不法资产阶级分子的罪恶渊薮”。（见人民日报八月十九日政法工作简评）它给国家和人民造成的损失，是难以计算的。然而对徐州市人民法院这么严重的问题，在“三反”前我们一直不了解，甚至连前院长王景武本身隐瞒历史、贪赃枉法、吸食毒品、包庇反革命，在工作中阳奉阴违、欺上压下的严重情形都不知道。
    我们的官僚主义还不止此，更严重的是平时虽已发现法院的领导和工作有些问题，但却没有以严肃的态度给以处理和批评。法院随便扣押人，把不该判刑的人羁押几个月，把案件判错等事情是经常发生的。有些问题我们发觉了，也曾指示法院作正确处理，但终因没有检查督促，法院执行与否我们也不知道。特别是没有亲自或是组织一定的力量检查法院的工作，使法院的错误得不到及时纠正，这也助长了那些坏分子的胆大妄为。
    王景武本人及其他坏分子的违法乱纪行为，不是没有人知道的；在“三反”运动中，法院的工作人员就做了无情的揭发。过去所以长期没有被揭发出来的原因，主要是我们的民主作风不够。我们没能及时联系法院的同志，听取他们对法院的领导和工作的意见，对某些重要线索，我们也没有加以重视。如王景武曾几次要求调动法院的人事秘书，甚至恶意地在“三反”运动初期连续打击她，两次要求撤职查办她。我们当时虽然感到其中有些问题，而没有同意王景武的要求，但也没有深入了解情况，和那位人事秘书谈谈。今天事实证明，他俩之间的分歧，人事秘书的意见基本上是正确的，她并且知道法院中的很多问题。
    我们对人民法院是人民民主专政的武器、是与反革命作斗争的武器、是保障人民利益、保证生产建设的权力机关的认识不明确，不像对公安局那样重视。因而在干部配备上重视不够，对法院工作的领导是基本上没管。除大的运动如镇压反革命、清理积案等由我们直接领导法院进行工作以外，平时很少过问。既没有专门讨论过法院的工作，也没有检查过工作，对干部品质、历史、成分也没有进行详细审查。我们明知道法院自领导人员至某些审判人员，都有着严重的旧法观点，但除在一九五○年整风时原则地指出应作为整风重点以外，一直没再过问。我们这种领导不强、不重视法院的干部配备，也是造成法院错误的很重要的原因。
    伟大的“三反”运动沉重地打击了我们的官僚主义，法院的错误也逐步被揭发出来。我们在发现了市人民法院的严重情况后，曾做了慎重的、坚决的、严肃的处理。为了弄清情况，曾派市人民政府人事处长亲自查对材料。在查对材料属实后，当即派了坚强有力的工作组帮助整顿法院组织。在中共徐州市委和徐州市人民政府的领导和直接掌握下，在派去的工作组及法院工作人员的努力下，经一个多月的时间，以王景武为首的徐州市人民法院的错误已被全部揭发出来。我们当即根据党的政策，群众的要求，将王景武逮捕法办，将贪赃枉法的民事处前处长杨仲萱、刑事处前副处长冯子鏖、郊区分院前副院长刘干忱撤职查办。对其他贪赃枉法、违法乱纪分子，也都分别给予刑事、行政等处分。
    另方面，我们也抽调了一批坚强有力的干部，充实了徐州市人民法院。因而在“三反”运动以后，徐州市人民法院已面貌一新。
    最近我们根据中央关于改革司法工作指示的精神，对徐州市人民法院已从组织上进行了彻底的改组。除在“三反”中已经处理的人员以外，又把一些不适于作司法工作的人员，分别介绍转业或作了其它处理；吸收了一部分工人及妇女参加了人民法院的工作。初步改造了一些旧的诉讼程序，撤除了门岗，加强了问事处工作，改善了候审室。目前正结合总结法院工作和检查旧案，肃清司法人员中的旧法观点。这一工作已获得一些成绩，得到广大群众的良好反映。我们将在这个基础上，在党及上级人民政府的领导下，本着中央改革司法工作的精神，接受过去的沉痛教训，努力作好徐州市人民法院的改革工作，以期使法院成为名符其实的人民民主专政的武器。
    徐州市人民法院的错误是严重的，给我们的教训是深刻的。我们除要接受这一事件的教训外，更重要的问题在于加强马克思列宁主义及毛泽东思想的理论学习，从提高我们的政治理论水平中克服我们工作中原则性不高、工作无中心、无重点、整日陷于事务忙乱的严重缺点。
