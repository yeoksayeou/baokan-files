Markets across the country have been generally trending towards greater activity since June of this year. The trading volume of commodities has increased substantially compared to before and after the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, with the transaction value of most commodities far exceeding the level of the same period last year. According to statistics from the Central Ministry of Commerce, the total sales volume of flour (public and private combined) in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Xi'an, Chongqing and other markets in June, July and August this year increased by 44.83 percent compared to March, April and May, and by 154.6 percent compared to the same period last year; cloth (public and private combined) increased by 44.84 percent compared to March, April and May, and by 120.4 percent compared to the same period last year. The sales volume of general merchandise across the country increased by 135.27 percent compared to the first quarter and by 202.53 percent compared to the same period last year. In more remote areas such as Luzhou City, Changning and Ebian in Sichuan, the trading volume in the market in July also exceeded the level of the peak sales season in December last year. The proportion of private merchants in the trading volume of markets in various regions has also increased. In June, July, and August of this year, the sales volume of cloth by private merchants in the nine major markets increased by 107 percent compared to the same period last year. In Xinghua County, northern Jiangsu, the turnover of private industry and commerce in the first ten days of July doubled compared to the first ten days of June; in Lanxi County, Zhejiang, the turnover of private department stores from June 1st to 12th increased by more than 90 percent compared to the same period in May.
The reason why the national market is becoming increasingly active is due not only to the fundamental factors such as the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production and the substantial increase in national investment in construction, but also to a series of effective measures taken by Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels through relevant state economic departments to activate the market.
After the end of the "Three-Anti" movement, Party and government leading organs in various regions organized many material exchange meetings. Large-scale urban-rural material exchange meetings were held in the four major administrative regions of North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest; provinces, cities, special districts, counties and towns also extensively organized small-scale material exchange meetings mainly for short-distance exchange. The total transaction amount in the urban-rural material exchange meetings held in the four major administrative regions of North China, Central South, East China, Southwest and ten provinces and administrative districts reached more than 7 trillion yuan; the total transaction amount of short-distance material exchange meetings (small-scale exchange meetings in counties and towns below the special district level) in the two major administrative regions of North China and East China also reached about 4 trillion yuan. These urban-rural material exchange meetings further and rapidly promoted the overall prosperity of the market. In the material exchange meetings in various regions, state-owned trading departments and cooperatives took the lead in purchasing and selling various materials in large quantities. The transaction volume of state-owned trading departments and cooperatives was very large. For example, it accounted for 61.21 percent of the total transaction volume in the Central South China urban-rural material exchange meeting and 69.1 percent of the total transaction volume in the Southwest China urban-rural material exchange meeting.
In order to activate the market and prosper the economy, state-owned trading enterprises and the People's Bank in various regions have devoted great efforts to processing, ordering, purchasing, and providing loans to private industry and commerce, helping them solve difficulties in production and operation. The total purchase amount of department stores in various regions in June, July, and August this year increased by 106.54 percent compared to the same period last year. The total value of processing and ordering in Beijing in the first half of the year increased by 114 percent compared to the same period last year, and the quantity of major commodities processed in the second quarter increased by more than 70 percent compared to the first quarter. The second quarter purchase figures of the state-owned trading system in Tianjin exceeded the original plan by 10 percent. State-owned trading enterprises in various regions have reasonably adjusted the profit from processing orders and the standards and specifications for acceptance of finished products. The People's Bank has lowered interest rates, simplified procedures, and expanded the scope of loans. According to statistics from the head office of the People's Bank of China, the total amount of loans in June, July, and August this year (missing figures for the last ten days) increased by more than 198 percent compared to the same period last year. The strong cooperation of tax, transportation and other departments has also played a significant role in activating the market.

    全国各地市场日渐活跃
    六、七、八月大部商品交易量较去年同期大为增加
    今年六月以后，全国市场已全面趋向活跃。商品交易量较“三反”“五反”运动前后大有增加，大部分商品的交易额远远超过去年同期的水平。根据中央商业部统计，今年六、七、八月份上海、北京、天津、武汉、广州、青岛、西安、重庆等地市场的面粉总销售量（公私营合计）较三、四、五月份增加百分之四四·八三，较去年同期增加百分之一五四·六；布匹（公私营合计）较三、四、五月份增加百分之四四·八四，较去年同期增加百分之一二○·四。全国各地百货销售量较第一季度增加百分之一三五·二七，较去年同期增加百分之二○二·五三。地处偏远的四川泸州市、长宁、峨边等十多市、县，七月份市场交易额也超过去年十二月份旺销季节的水平。在各地市场的交易量中，私商所占的比重也有增加。今年六、七、八月九大市场私商销布量较去年同期增加了百分之一○七。苏北兴化县七月上旬私营工商业营业额较六月上旬增加一倍；浙江兰溪县私营百货业六月一日到十二日的营业额，较五月同期增加百分之九十以上。
    全国市场所以日趋活跃，除了工、农业生产飞跃发展、国家在建设方面的投资大量增加等根本原因外，还在于各地党的组织和人民政府通过国家有关经济部门，采取了一系列活跃市场的有效措施。
    各地党政领导机关在“三反”运动结束后，组织了许多物资交流会议。华北、华东、中南、西南四大行政区都举行了大型的城乡物资交流会；各省、市及专区、县镇也广泛地组织了小型的以短距离交流为主的物资交流会。华北、中南、华东、西南四大行政区及十个省和行署区举行的城乡物资交流会中，成交总金额达七万亿元以上；华北、华东两大行政区的短距离物资交流会（专区以下的县、镇小型交流会）成交总金额亦达四万亿元左右。通过这些城乡物资交流会，更加迅速地促进了市场的全面繁荣。在各地物资交流会中，国营贸易部门和合作社带头大量购销各种物资。国营贸易部门和合作社的成交量很大，如中南区城乡物资交流会占总成交量的百分之六一·二一，西南区城乡物资交流会占总成交量的百分之六九·一。
    为了活跃市场、繁荣经济，各地国营贸易企业和人民银行用很大力量对私营工商业进行了加工、订货、收购、贷款工作，帮助其解决生产和经营上的困难。全国各地百货公司今年六、七、八月份收购总额较去年同期增加百分之一○六·五四。北京市上半年加工、订货总值较去年同期增加了百分之一一四，第二季度主要商品加工数量比第一季度又增加了百分之七十强。天津市国营贸易系统第二季度收购数字超过原计划百分之十。各地国营贸易企业合理地调整了加工订货利润和验收成品的标准、规格。人民银行降低了利率，并且简化了手续，扩大了贷款范围。据中国人民银行总行统计，今年六、七、八月（缺下旬数目字）贷款总额较去年同期增加了百分之一九八以上。税收、运输等部门的有力配合，也对活跃市场起了很大的作用。
