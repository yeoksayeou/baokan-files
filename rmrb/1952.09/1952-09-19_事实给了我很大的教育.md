Facts Have Taught Me a Great Deal
Liu Decheng, Technician, Qinghe Woolen Mill

Technical personnel who want to actively participate in the promotion of advanced experience must overcome their erroneous views of "being satisfied with technical knowledge in books, looking down on the practical experience of workers," and "valuing machines and not people" with the greatest determination.

The reason I didn't pay attention to promoting advanced experience in the past was because I looked down on the advanced experience of the workers. When the 1951 Weaving Method was published in the newspaper, I wasn't interested when I saw the words "Method." I thought: it's just the same old worker operation, nothing special.

In June, the Advanced Work Method Performance Conference held by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions helped me a lot. At that meeting, a female worker from the People's Printing Factory demonstrated an advanced method for folding book pages. Watching her demonstration, I realized that it was not the simple action I had imagined, but contained a lot of scientific principles. After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement this year, leading cadres often educated me and helped me recognize the importance of promoting advanced experience at present. I began to realize the error of my past views and resolved to devote myself to the promotion of advanced experience.

In early August, I participated in the promotion of the 1951 Weaving Method in the fine weaving workshop. After a short period of practical work, I specifically understood how technical personnel should view the creations of the masses. The following examples have given me a very profound education.

Once, when we were studying how to deal with tangled yarns on the warp behind the loom, my opinion was originally to use the method in the 1951 Weaving Method. Later, female worker Xia Jinmei, based on her own operating experience, proposed another method of handling it. After everyone's research, it was indeed simpler than the original method. Recently, when we were studying how to inspect the warp beam behind the loom, my opinion was to go to the back of the loom to inspect it every time two spools had been woven. Later, the workers suggested inspecting it every time three spools had been woven. After practical testing, it proved that the workers' opinion was also correct.

These opinions of the workers cannot be found in our technical personnel's books. Our technical personnel must take their technical theories into practice for testing and summarize the advanced experience of the masses so that we can become people welcomed by the masses.

In the past, I rarely approached the workers. I've been in the factory for several years, and many workers still don't know my name. I didn't used to work night shifts, but this time I broke the routine, and I followed them when they worked night shifts. After starting to promote advanced experience, I moved into the large dormitory and lived with the "little teachers." Sure enough, it didn't take long for the workers to stop being as distant with me as they used to be. When they were about to go to bed at night, they would ask me about machine and technical issues. I also got closer to them.

Through our mutual research and learning, twelve "little teachers" have initially mastered the 1951 Weaving Method, and can systematically patrol and inspect the cloth surface and warp beams, and handle defective cloth and broken yarns during operation. Because many situations in woolen mills are different from those in cotton mills, the 1951 Weaving Method cannot be completely applied, and therefore, we have summarized our own experience to supplement some operations. If I hadn't studied with the workers, this situation would not have occurred.

My participation in the promotion of the 1951 Weaving Method is only the beginning of my overcoming erroneous ideas. I must continue to work hard and thoroughly transform myself.

    事实给了我很大的教育
    清河制呢厂技师  刘德成
    技术人员要使自己积极参加推广先进经验的工作，必须要以最大的决心克服自己“满足于书本上的技术知识，轻视工人的实际经验”、“重视机器不重视人”的错误观点。
    我过去不重视推广先进经验，就是因为看不起职工的先进经验。当一九五一织布工作法在报上公布出来后，我看见“工作法”三字，就不感兴趣，我想：还不是工人操作的那一套，没有什么。
    六月间，北京市总工会召开的先进工作法表演大会，对我帮助很大。在那会上，人民印刷厂有一个女工表演摺书页的先进操作法。我看了她的表演，使我感到这不是我所想像的简单动作，而含有很多科学道理。今年开展增产节约运动后，领导干部又时常教育我，帮助我认识目前推广先进经验的重要。我开始认识到自己过去看法的错误，决心要投身到推广先进经验工作中去。
    八月初，我参加了精织车间推广一九五一织布工作法的推广工作。经过短短时间的实际工作，又使我具体领会到技术人员应该怎样看待群众的创造。下面几个事例，都给我很深刻的教育。
    有一次，当我们研究怎样处理车后经纱上发生的绞头纱时，我的意见原来是用一九五一织布工作法上的那个方法。后来，女工夏金妹，根据自己的操作经验，提出另一个处理的方法。经大家研究，确实比原来的那个方法简便。最近当我们研究怎样检查车后经轴的问题时，我的意见是每当织过二个穗子后到车后去检查一次，后来，工人提出要每当织过三个穗子后到车后去检查一次。经过实际试验，证明工人的意见也是对的。
    工人这些意见，都是我们技术人员在书本上找不到的。我们技术人员必须要把自己的技术理论拿到实际中去考验，总结群众的先进经验，我们才能成为群众所欢迎的人。
    过去，我很少接近工人，在厂好几年了，许多工人还不知道我叫什么名字。我原来是不上夜班的，这次我也把惯例打破了，他们上夜班我也跟着上。开始推广先进经验工作后，我便搬到大宿舍里和“小先生”们住在一起。果然，没有多久，工人就不像以前那样的同我疏远了，晚上临睡觉的时候，还问我机器上、技术上的问题。我对他们也比较靠近了。
    经过我们互相研究、学习，十二个“小先生”已初步掌握了一九五一织布工作法，做到在操作时，能有计划地巡回检查布面、经轴，处理次布、坏纱。因为毛纺织厂许多情况和棉纺织厂不一样，不能完全搬用一九五一织布工作法，因而，在某些操作法上，我们又总结了自己的经验加以补充。如果我不和工人在一起研究，这种情况是不会出现的。
    我参加推广一九五一织布工作法的工作，还只是我克服错误思想的开始，我还要努力下去，彻底改造自己。
