    Shandong Kiln Factory Refractory Material Workshop Should Quickly Investigate the Reasons for Poor Quality Brick Blanks
    To the Editor: In the Shandong Kiln Factory Refractory Material Workshop, during the production increase and economy drive, the damage rate of brick blanks has recently increased compared to the past month, averaging over 20%.

    The main reason for these phenomena is that leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style and do not delve into the workshop to discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. Many workers lack a sufficient understanding of the significance of increasing production and practicing economy, and only pay attention to quantity while neglecting quality. In order to produce more bricks, workers make many bricks that do not meet specifications, and some bricks even have small cracks as soon as they are made. The workers repair them with mud, and no problems are visible at the time, but after drying and firing, about 35% of the cracked bricks can be picked out. In addition, some brick blanks are covered with mud, so although no problems are found after drying, the fired bricks have cracks accounting for more than 10%, and the waste rate of one kiln is as high as 40% at the highest. Based on the average value of the waste firing rate in July alone, a total of 38.5 tons of refractory bricks were damaged, equivalent to more than 28 million yuan in Renminbi.

    I hope that the leading cadres of this factory will quickly solve the above-mentioned problems, delve into the workshop to check the reasons for the poor quality, and strengthen the education of the workers in order to fully carry out the production increase and economy movement.

### 山东窑业厂耐火材料车间应速检查砖坯质量不好的原因

    山东窑业厂耐火材料车间应速检查砖坯质量不好的原因
    编辑同志：山东窑业厂耐火材料车间，在增产节约运动中，最近一个月来砖坯的损坏率反较前增加，平均达百分之二十以上。
    产生这些现象的主要原因，是领导干部存在着官僚主义作风，不深入车间发现问题，及时解决。许多工人对增产节约意义认识不足，只注意数量，忽视质量。工人为了多砸砖，致砸出来的砖有很多不合规格，甚至有些砖刚砸出来就有小裂纹子。工人们用泥浆修修，当时看不出毛病来，但到干燥和烧成车间以后，就能拣出百分之三十五左右开裂的砖。还有一部分砖坯，因用泥浆盖住，虽然在干了以后发现不出毛病，但烧出后裂纹的占百分之十以上，最高时一窑的废品率竟达百分之四十。仅以七月份废品烧成率总平均值计算，共损坏耐火砖三十八点五吨，折合人民币二千八百余万元。
    我希望这个厂的领导干部迅速解决上述问题，深入车间检查质量不好的原因，并加强对工人的教育，以便全面地开展增产节约运动。
