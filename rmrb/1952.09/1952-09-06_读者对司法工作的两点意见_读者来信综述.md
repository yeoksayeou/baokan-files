Readers' Two Opinions on Judicial Work
    ——Summary of Readers' Letters

In August, this newspaper received a total of 73 letters from readers offering opinions on judicial work. Among them, 18 letters criticized the courts for not handling cases in a timely manner, 37 letters requested that mishandled cases be inspected and corrected, and 18 letters criticized the poor work style of individual judicial staff and reflected other opinions. Some of these letters have been published in this newspaper, some are still under study and handling, and most have been forwarded to relevant departments for inspection and handling. Judging from the situation reflected in these letters, there are two tendencies in the handling of cases by some courts that deserve attention. These are:

I. Courts do not pay enough attention to cases initiated by the people through letters, especially divorce cases are not handled in a timely manner. Reader Zhang Lianhai wrote that in 1949, he sent a letter to the Judicial Section of the Longyao County People's Government of Hebei Province at that time, requesting that his divorce case be handled according to law, and attached a certificate issued by his work unit. More than three years have passed, and he has sent a total of more than 20 letters. The Judicial Section either ignored him or said, "The parents will not allow the divorce," and the problem has not been resolved. Reader Zhang Kexin wrote that in order to get rid of the pain of feudal marriage, he applied to the Wen County People's Court of Pingyuan Province in September 1951 to go through divorce procedures. Unexpectedly, after the application was sent, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, without even a single piece of news. Later, he sent registered letters and express letters one after another to urge processing, but it has been almost a year now, and there is still no news. Readers Deng Quanzhi from Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, Zheng Jun from Beijing Army Hospital, Ye Jianping from Jinan Branch of China Salt Industry Corporation, and reader Gan Xiufen and others wrote to express their opinions on the judicial organs' failure to attach importance to cases initiated by the people through letters.

II. Some courts do not pay attention to the enforcement of judgments, so that the legitimate rights and interests of the people cannot be guaranteed. Reader Li Ping wrote that the land dispute between Guo Xiuling, a family member of a martyr, and Xue Qingpu in Xue Wu Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province, has been retried and judged by the Xingtai Special Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court, and five mu of land were sentenced to be owned by Guo Xiuling. Guo Xiuling asked the Nangong County People's Court to enforce the judgment. The court either pushed it to the village or to the special district court. Guo Xiuling went to the court a total of twelve times, but the county court never enforced it. The land is still in Xue Qingpu's hands. Reader Zhu Chongxiu wrote that her divorce case was concluded by mediation by the Zhongcheng District People's Court of Beijing on March 10 this year. The judgment stipulated that the man should give the child 150 jin of millet for living expenses every month; but it has been more than five months now, and the man has only given the child 100,000 yuan for living expenses. From May 12 to now, she has been to the court eleven times, made three phone calls, and written a letter once, asking the court to enforce the judgment. The comrades of the court either said, "There are too many new cases, and there is no time to execute the cases," or deliberately delayed, and did not actively enforce the judgment, which affected the child's life and health. Readers' letters reflecting similar situations include: Ye Guizhen in Shanghai, Wang Xiuying, Kong Wenxuan, and Wang Shuzhen in Yuci, Shanxi.

Readers' letters unanimously pointed out that the people's court is a weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship. It should simplify the litigation procedures as much as possible to facilitate the people. For general cases in which the people initiate lawsuits by letter due to the fact that both parties do not live in the same place, it should be given the same importance as cases in which the parties personally initiate lawsuits and be dealt with in a timely manner; for cases that have been judged, they should be resolutely enforced to protect the legitimate interests of the people. The failure of the People's Court of Longyao County, Hebei Province, and the People's Court of Wen County, Pingyuan Province, to handle the cases of Zhang Lianhai and Zhang Kexin who requested divorce in a timely manner is obviously related to their old legal views that do not attach importance to handling people's complaints; and the failure of the People's Court of Nangong County, Hebei Province, and the People's Court of Zhongcheng District, Beijing, to resolutely enforce the judgments is a concrete manifestation of the bureaucratic style of not paying attention to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of the people. It is hoped that the relevant organs mentioned above will conduct a thorough inspection in the judicial reform movement and make appropriate arrangements.

### 读者对司法工作的两点意见——读者来信综述

    读者对司法工作的两点意见
    ——读者来信综述
    八月份本报收到读者对司法工作提意见的信共计七十三件，其中对法院处理案件不及时提出批评的十八件，对处理案件不当要求检查纠正的三十七件，批评个别司法工作人员工作作风不好及反映其他意见的十八件。这些来信，有的已在本报发表，有的尚待研究处理，大部分都已转请各有关部门检查处理。从这些来信所反映的情况看，有些法院在处理案件当中，有这样两种偏向，是值得引起注意的。这就是：
    一、法院对人民用书信方式起诉的案件，不够重视；特别是对于离婚案件处理不及时。读者张连海来信说，他在一九四九年曾给当时的河北省隆尧县人民政府司法科去信，请求依法处理他的离婚案件，并随信附去所在工作机关开具的证明信。到现在已经三年多了，先后共去信二十几封，司法科不是置之不理，就是说“家长不让离婚”，问题一直没有解决。读者张克新来信说，他为了解脱封建婚姻的痛苦，一九五一年九月向平原省温县人民法院声请办理离婚手续。不料声请书寄去后，如石沉大海，连一点音信也没有。以后接二连三地去双挂号信、快信催请处理，到现在将近一年，仍无音信。黑龙江省绥化县读者邓全芝、北京陆军医院政军、中国盐业公司济南分公司叶鉴平及读者甘秀芬等来信，他们都对司法机关不重视人民群众以书信方式起诉案件提出意见。
    二、有的法院不注意执行判决，使人民的合法权益得不到保障。读者李平来信说，河北省南宫县薛吴村烈属郭秀苓和薛庆普的土地纠纷，已由河北省人民法院邢台专区分院再审判决，将土地五亩判归郭秀苓所有。郭秀苓请南宫县人民法院执行判决，法院不是向村里推，就是向专区法院推，郭秀苓一共到法院去了十二次，县法院始终不给执行，到现在土地还是在薛庆普手中。读者朱崇秀来信说，她的离婚案件，今年三月十日由北京市中城区人民法院调解结束，判决由男方每月给孩子生活费一百五十斤小米；但到现在已五个多月了，男方只给了孩子生活费十万元。从五月十二日到现在，她先后到法院十一次，打电话三次，写信一次，请法院执行判决。法院的同志不是说“新案子太多，执行案子没工夫”，就是故意推拖，不积极执行判决，以致影响孩子的生活和健康。读者来信反映类似情况的，还有：上海叶桂珍、山西榆次王秀英、孔文轩、汪淑贞等人。
    读者来信一致指出：人民法院是人民民主专政的武器，应该尽量简化诉讼程序，给人民以方便，对于人民群众因双方居住不在一地而用书信起诉的一般性的案件，应该与当事人亲自起诉的案件同等重视，及时给以处理；对于已经判决的案件，则应坚决执行，以保障人民的合法利益。河北省隆尧县人民法院、平原省温县人民法院等不及时处理张连海、张克新要求离婚的案件，显然是与他们不重视处理人民投书控诉的旧法观点有关；而河北省南宫县人民法院、北京市中城区人民法院等不坚决执行判决，也就是不注意保障人民合法权益的官僚主义作风的具体表现。希望上述有关机关在司法改革运动中，进行彻底的检查，并作适当处理。
