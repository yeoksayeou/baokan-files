    Designs Detached from Reality Inevitably Fail
    —The Lessons of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant's Capital Construction
    To manufacture large and medium-sized generators, the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant began constructing a new factory in a certain location in Shanghai in August of last year. This was the largest capital construction project invested in by the East China Industrial Department in 1951. The factory has been under construction for a year, but due to many serious problems in planning and design, it has not only failed to complete the capital construction targets on schedule, but has also caused great waste and losses.
    The main shortcoming of the new construction project of the Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant is the failure to formulate a thorough plan based on the overall situation and the plant's existing specific conditions. All designs were determined solely by a few technical personnel based on their knowledge learned in the United States in the past and some one-sided experience in their work. For example, how much potential has the plant's existing equipment actually realized? According to the average advanced quotas improved by the workers' mass creativity and initiative, how much more machinery and equipment is actually needed to complete the task of manufacturing new products as planned? Is all the machinery and equipment to be added absolutely necessary? From the perspective of balancing and improving productivity, what is the degree of need? These questions were not carefully considered. For example, in the machine layout diagram, in addition to the plant's existing and planned purchase of machines, there are many machines and workbenches that were completely filled in to supplement the blank spaces on the drawing during the rush plan. These machines, which were included without careful consideration, are worth as much as 4 to 5 billion yuan, and it was not investigated whether they could be ordered domestically or abroad. As for how to rationally arrange machinery and equipment according to the production operation process, and determine the standards of factory building height, size, structure, and load weight, etc., there was even less thorough research. Initially, only the crowded conditions of the old factory were consulted, and a general standard of ten square meters of work area per person was hastily drafted; later, because the design exceeded the budget, it was changed again and again without investigation. Because there were too many temporary changes, it affected the coordination of the overall situation even more. For example, the cold working workshop was shortened to sixty meters, making some of the machine layouts too crowded, and affecting the layout of the punching and shearing workshop, so the punching and shearing workshop had to be added separately to the rotary motor workshop and the transformer workshop. For example, the woodworking workshop also did not have a fixed address, but was placed in the transformer workshop. All of these will affect future production. Due to the confusion of the overall plan, plan and design were not careful in individual problems and individual factory building designs. For example, whether the sand casting parts, which are important for the manufacturing work of the plant, are supplied by the general machinery factory, or obtained from other factories in Shanghai, has not been clearly decided; even the designers cannot say what the cold working machines and miscellaneous machines include. Many of the designs are detached from the actual needs of production, and are added and subtracted on the layout diagram, causing waste. For example, the public tool workshop has a total area of only 1,440 square meters, but there are as many as eight large doors that are three meters wide and four meters high; the height of the workshop is six meters, which can also be reduced by one meter according to actual needs; in this tall workshop, many small houses are also built for office inspection. If the workshop is reduced by four large doors and the small houses are moved out, not only will it not affect transportation, but the workshop area can also be saved by 365.94 square meters, which can save funds of more than 410 million yuan.
    Due to the above-mentioned erroneous plans and designs, serious rework and waste have been caused, and the construction period has been delayed. According to the plan, the plant should have completed 58% of the construction tasks by the end of last year, but in reality only 12% was completed. When revising the plan this year, it was also required to add 60% to the budget.
    The reason why errors occurred in the plant's capital construction work is mainly because the leading cadres of the plant have erroneous views on capital construction. They thought that capital construction was just "building a few houses," and that everything would be fine as long as they received the funds and contracted out the project. Therefore, they regarded the planning and design work of capital construction as official documents to deal with the superiors and request appropriations, and handed them over to the technical personnel to do, without recognizing that this is a fundamental problem in economic construction, and that they should personally lead and study diligently. This is the fundamental reason for the errors.

    脱离实际的设计必然失败
    ——上海电机厂基本建设的教训
    上海电机厂为了制造大、中型发电机，于去年八月起在上海某处新建一处工厂，这是一九五一年华东工业部投资最大的一项基本建设工程。这个工厂修建已经一年，但由于计划和设计工作存在着许多严重问题，不仅没有按期完成基本建设的指标，而且造成很大的浪费和损失。
    上海电机厂新建工程的主要缺点，是没有根据全面情况和该厂现有的具体情况来拟订周密的计划。一切设计，仅凭几个技术人员根据过去在美国所学习的知识和工作中的一些片面经验来决定的。例如该厂现有设备的潜力究竟发挥了多少？按照工人群众发挥创造性、积极性后而提高了的平均先进定额，为完成预定制造新产品的任务，所需机器设备究竟还缺多少？所拟添置的机器设备是否全属必需？从平衡和提高生产力着眼，其需要的程度怎样？对这些问题，都没有经过深思熟虑。又如在机器布置图中，除该厂现有及计划订购的机器以外，有很多机器、钳台完全是在赶造计划时为补充图上的空白而填上的，这些未经慎重考虑即行列入的机器，价值四五十亿元之多，而且是否可以在国内外订购到，也没有调查。至于怎样根据生产操作过程来合理地布置机器设备，确定厂房的高低、大小、结构的标准和负荷的重量等，更没有周密研究。最初仅仅参酌老厂的拥挤情况，草草拟定每人应有十平方公尺的工作面积的笼统标准；以后因为设计超出预算，又不经调查而一改再改。由于临时改动太多，更影响了全局的协调，如把冷作工场缩短为六十公尺，使部分机器布置的过于拥挤，且影响了冲剪工场的布置，不得不把冲剪工场分别加在旋转电机工场和变压器工场之内。如木工场也没有一定地址，而把它放在变压器工场内。这些都会影响到将来的生产。由于全盘计划的混乱，因之在个别问题上和个别的厂房设计上，也显出计划与设计不周。例如对该厂制造工作关系重大的翻砂铸件，究由通用机器厂供应，还是向上海其他工厂取得，没有明确决定；冷作机器、杂项机器究竟包括那些内容，连设计人员也说不出来。不少的设计都脱离了生产的实际需要，在布置图上添来添去，造成浪费。又如公用工具工场，总面积不过一千四百四十平方公尺，而三公尺宽四公尺高的大门竟有八个之多；场房的高度为六公尺，按实际需要也可减低一公尺；在这座高大的工场中，还造了许多为办公检验所用的小房子。若把这个工场减去四个大门，把小房子移出，不但不会影响交通运输，该工场面积还可省去三百六十五点九四平方公尺，就可以节约资金四亿一千余万元。
    由于以上错误的计划和设计，造成严重的返工浪费，并延误工期。按计划，该厂在去年年底，应完成建设任务的百分之五十八，但实际上只完成百分之十二。今年修改计划时，还要求追加预算百分之六十。
    该厂的基本建设工作所以发生错误，主要是该厂的领导干部对基本建设有错误的看法。他们以为基本建设只是“盖几间房子”，只要领到款子，把工程包出去，就万事大吉了。因此，他们将基本建设的计划和设计工作，看作是应付上级的、要求拨款的官样文章，全部交给技术人员去作，而没有认清这是经济建设中的基本问题，应该亲自领导，虚心钻研。这便是造成错误的根本原因。
