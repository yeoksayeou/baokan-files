Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 19th to discuss the application of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to join the United Nations, as well as the applications of the U.S.-French puppets Bao Dai Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to join the United Nations. The Soviet Union suggested accepting the application of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, while France suggested accepting the three U.S.-French puppets, Bao Dai Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, into the United Nations.

The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France opposed the acceptance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's application. They absurdly said that the application was submitted by a "nonexistent country that no one knows about."

Soviet representative Malik exposed the groundlessness of these remarks by the U.S., British, and French representatives. He pointed out that Daladier recently admitted in the newspapers that France had 188,000 troops stationed in Indochina. Was this to fight "ghosts," or was it an armed aggression against a real country, a real government, and people fighting for their national freedom and independence? According to the report of the General Command of the People's Army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, from December 1946 to June 1952, the army and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam annihilated 219,346 enemy officers and soldiers in the liberation war against foreign aggression. How could "a nonexistent country," "a nonexistent army," and "a nonexistent" government and people achieve such results?

Malik continued: It must be pointed out that as the situation gradually showed that the French army was unable to defeat the resistance of the Vietnamese people and the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the United States personally took on the main task of the war of aggression against the Vietnamese people. In July of this year, French High Commissioner to Indochina Letourneau said that at least 40 percent of all war materials shipped to Indochina were from U.S. military aid. According to American newspaper reports, the total value of materials supplied by the United States for the war of aggression against the people of Indochina has reached one billion U.S. dollars. Therefore, it is no wonder that the representatives of the U.S.-British bloc oppose the acceptance of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into the United Nations.

The U.S.-British bloc in the Security Council finally rejected the Soviet proposal to accept the Democratic Republic of Vietnam into the United Nations.

The French proposal to accept the U.S.-French puppets Bao Dai Vietnam and others into the United Nations was also rejected. The Soviet delegation voted against this proposal.

### 马立克斥美国反对越南加入联合国的谬论  苏联否决接受保大傀儡等参加联合国的法国提案

    马立克斥美国反对越南加入联合国的谬论
    苏联否决接受保大傀儡等参加联合国的法国提案
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会在十九日举行会议，讨论了越南民主共和国申请加入联合国以及美法两国的傀儡保大越南、寮国和高棉申请加入联合国的问题。苏联建议接受越南民主共和国的申请，而法国则建议接受保大越南、寮国、高棉这三个美法两国的傀儡参加联合国。
    美、英、法三国代表反对接受越南民主共和国的申请。他们竟荒谬地说：这个申请是由一个“谁也不晓得的、并不存在的”国家提出来的。
    苏联代表马立克揭露了美、英、法代表这些言论的毫无根据。他指出：达拉第最近在报纸上承认，法国驻在印度支那的军队有十八万八千人。这是为了和“鬼影”作战，还是为了对一个真正的国家、对一个真正的政府、对为争取祖国自由独立而战斗的人民进行武装侵略呢？根据越南民主共和国人民军总司令部的报告，从一九四六年十二月到一九五二年六月，越南民主共和国的军队和人民在反对外国侵略的解放战争中共歼灭敌军官兵二十一万九千三百四十六人。“一个并不存在的国家”、“一个并不存在的军队”、“一个并不存在的”政府和人民，怎么能够获得这样的战果呢？
    马立克继续说：必须指出，当局势渐渐说明法国军队没有能力打垮越南人民和越南民主共和国武装部队的抵抗之后，美国就亲自担负了对越南人民进行侵略战争的主要任务。今年七月，法国驻印度支那高级专员勒都尔诺曾经说：目前运送到印度支那的全部战争物资中，美国军事援助至少占百分之四十。据美国报纸消息，美国供给侵略印度支那人民的战争使用的物资，总值已经达到十亿美元。因此，怪不得美英集团的代表要反对接受越南民主共和国参加联合国了。
    安全理事会中的美英集团终于否决了苏联建议接受越南民主共和国参加联合国的提案。
    法国建议接受美法两国的傀儡保大越南等参加联合国的提案也被否决了。苏联代表团投票反对这个提案。
