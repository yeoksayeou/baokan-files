The Beijing Public Security Bureau began piloting "classroom discussion" in its intermediate and primary cadre theory study classes in the second half of last year. The results of the pilot program have proven that "classroom discussion" is indeed a very good learning method for cadres who lack self-study ability. Before the implementation of "classroom discussion," learning discussions were conducted in small groups. Due to the low theoretical level of the group leaders and their insufficient preparation beforehand, the group meetings generally failed to correctly address the main issues in learning. Ideological leadership in learning was very weak, and a state of self-flow and semi-self-flow existed everywhere. These phenomena were in great contradiction with the ever-increasing learning demands of cadres. Since the adoption of the "classroom discussion" method last year, although many study instructors have not yet mastered this method proficiently, the face of cadre learning has been fundamentally changed. It has not only played a significant role in checking teaching effectiveness, consolidating learning achievements, and implementing the content of large lectures in a planned and step-by-step manner, but also greatly enhanced cadres' learning initiative and cultivated their ability to systematically analyze problems. Currently, the "classroom discussion" method has been universally and warmly welcomed by cadres in the Beijing Public Security Bureau system. We have the following experiences in piloting this method:

I. Preparation before "Classroom Discussion"

The key to the success or failure of "classroom discussion" lies primarily in the preparation work of both students and study instructors. The students' preparation work mainly includes self-study, informal talks, and writing discussion outlines. Because discussion outlines can centrally express the students' thoughts, we particularly emphasize the importance of writing discussion outlines, requiring study instructors to check the discussion outlines in a planned manner before the "classroom discussion." Judging from the situation since the pilot program began, the vast majority of students attach importance to writing discussion outlines; however, in the early stages of the pilot program, because many students were not good at independent thinking and could not analyze and explain problems in their own language, they only paid attention to copying reference books. The reason for this phenomenon is mainly that the students did not digest the content of the large lectures and reference books well, merely floating on the surface of the documents without grasping their spirit and essence. In response to this situation, we put forward the call to "read seriously and use your brains," requiring each student, after listening to a large lecture, to first carefully review the lecture and read the designated reference books; then use their brains to repeatedly think and grasp the basic spirit of the lecture; and finally, based on their own understanding, write a discussion outline addressing the "classroom discussion" topic. As a result of implementing this method, the phenomenon of simply copying reference books has been largely corrected. On the study instructor's side, in addition to checking the students' discussion outlines, understanding the students' preparation, and collecting difficult problems, they must also go through full preparation and make a summary outline for each "classroom discussion" topic.

In addition, related to the "classroom discussion" discussion outline is the "classroom discussion" topic. Based on a year of experience, we believe that when formulating topics, on the one hand, it is necessary to appropriately point out the center of preparing the discussion outline, and on the other hand, to avoid restricting students' thinking. The "classroom discussion" topics should be neither too general nor too fragmented. A relatively good "classroom discussion" topic should raise several key points under a central issue in order to gradually guide students to practice making systematic and comprehensive analyses and explanations of a central issue.

II. How to Guide Speaking

Each problem's "classroom discussion" must go through two stages: first, students speak, and finally, the study instructor summarizes.

In the "classroom discussion" speeches, we have found two deviations in the past: one is that the students mechanically followed the discussion outline, each speaking their own way, turning the "classroom discussion" into a series of isolated speeches that were unconnected and lifeless; the other is that they could not grasp the main issues for in-depth discussion, only arguing endlessly on trivial issues, or digressing too far, going off the point. "Classroom discussion" must be conducted with leadership and focus, and each person's speech should become an inseparable part of the "classroom discussion" process. Therefore, in addition to the first person to speak being able to analyze and explain the problem completely according to the prepared discussion outline, subsequent speakers must address the previous speeches and express their opinions, affirming or supplementing what is correct, criticizing what is wrong, and not mechanically speaking according to their own outlines. Therefore, everyone must pay close attention to other people's speeches during the discussion process, supplement and revise their own discussion outlines, and prepare for their own speeches.

The responsibility of the study instructor in guiding the "classroom discussion" speeches is to promptly propose a clear discussion center, guide the direction of the discussion, and correct deviations in the speeches. In particular, it is necessary to promptly and clearly prompt the points of divergence in the discussion in order to guide everyone to gradually deepen the discussion. In addition, in the development process of a central issue discussion, they must also be good at flexibly raising new issues closely related to the central issue. In order to more comprehensively check the students' degree of understanding, the study instructor should also try to take into account the universality of the speeches and consciously use a combination of designated speeches and free speeches.

III. Summary at the End of the Discussion

After each issue has been fully discussed by everyone, the study instructor should make a summary of the discussion of this issue based on their own prepared summary outline and in conjunction with everyone's speeches. To make a good summary, the study instructor must pay attention to two issues: first, the purpose of the summary is to enable students to draw clear conclusions from complex and chaotic opinions. In order to make it easy for students to understand and remember, the summary needs to be concise, clear, and specific. Second, the summary must be closely linked to everyone's speeches. For everyone's speeches, the summary is both a summary of everyone's speeches and a supplement or critique of everyone's speeches. In the past, some of our study instructors simply made summaries according to the prepared summary outlines, disconnected from the students' speeches, causing many students to feel that the "summary is not profound" and "does not solve my problem," etc. Therefore, study instructors need to absorb everyone's opinions to enrich their summary outlines during the discussion process, and critically "incorporate" everyone's speech content into their own summaries.

IV. "Classroom Discussion" Should Be Combined with Small Group Informal Talks

"Classroom discussion" is limited by time and can only solve the main problems in learning. Therefore, small group informal talks are still necessary and should become the preparation and supplement for "classroom discussion."

Before "classroom discussion," in order to enable the discussion to smoothly focus on solving the main problems, it is necessary to avoid bringing some nouns or fragmented problems into the "classroom discussion" to avoid wasting time and losing focus during the discussion. However, necessary nouns and certain fragmented problems must also be clarified, and the solution of these problems will also help the "classroom discussion" to proceed, so it is necessary to conduct one or two small group informal talks before the "classroom discussion."

After "classroom discussion," small group informal talks should also be conducted. In addition to solving the trivial issues left over from the "classroom discussion," further supplementary discussions should also be made. Especially when studying theories related to ideological methods and work methods such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," only the main typical examples can be linked in the "classroom discussion," and it is impossible for every comrade to make full speeches in connection with their own ideological reality, so further universal and in-depth connection with reality must be carried out in small group informal talks.

V. Selecting and Training "Classroom Discussion" Study Instructors

Correctly selecting and training study instructors is the key issue in leading "classroom discussion." Study instructors should be cadres with a relatively high theoretical and cultural level. Currently, the study instructors of the Beijing Public Security Bureau's intermediate class are mostly senior cadres with more than ten years of revolutionary history and a certain theoretical level.

In addition to administratively trying to take care of their study time and providing reference materials for the training and improvement of study instructors, "classroom discussion" preparation meetings are a good method. At the "classroom discussion" preparation meeting, through everyone's discussion, the instructors can clearly recognize the key points of each problem, which is of great help in mastering "classroom discussion." In addition, for some study instructors with poor levels, "classroom discussion" preparation meetings can also be held in the form of "classroom discussion," which will be of greater help to them.

    北京市公安局试行“课堂讨论”的几点体会
    耿直
    北京市公安局从去年下半年开始在干部理论学习的中级班和初级班试行“课堂讨论”，试行的结果证明：对于那些缺乏自修能力的干部来说，“课堂讨论”确是一种很好的学习方法。在未实行“课堂讨论”之前，学习讨论都分散在小组中进行。由于小组长理论水平低下，也由于他们事前准备不足，所以小组会一般都不能正确地解决学习中的主要问题。学习上的思想领导是很薄弱的，自流和半自流状态到处存在着。这些现象，和不断增长着的干部学习要求发生了很大的矛盾。自去年采用了“课堂讨论”方法之后，虽然许多学习辅导员还不能熟练地掌握这种方法，但已经根本改变了干部学习的面貌。它不仅在检查教学效果、巩固学习成绩、有计划有步骤地贯彻大课内容上起了很大作用；而且也大大提高了干部学习的自觉性，培养了干部系统分析问题的能力。目前，“课堂讨论”的方法，在北京市公安局系统的干部中已受到普遍的热烈的欢迎。我们在试行这种方法中有下列几点体会：
    一、“课堂讨论”前的准备工作
    “课堂讨论”成败的关键，首先决定于学员和学习辅导员两方面的准备工作。学员的准备工作，主要是自修、漫谈、写发言提纲。因为发言提纲可以集中地表现学员的思想，所以我们特别强调写发言提纲的重要性，要求学习辅导员在“课堂讨论”之前，必须有计划地检查发言提纲。从试行以来的情况来看，绝大多数学员对写发言提纲都是重视的；但在开始试行时，由于许多学员还不善于独立思考，还不能用自己的语言来分析和说明问题，所以就只注意抄录参考书。这种现象产生的原因，主要是学员没有很好消化大课内容和参考书，只是浮在文件表面，而未领会其精神实质。针对这种情况，我们便提出了“认真读书、开动脑子”的号召，要求每一个学员在听大课之后，首先仔细复习大课，阅读指定的参考书；然后开动脑子反复思考，掌握大课的基本精神；最后根据自己的领会，针对“课堂讨论”题目，写出发言提纲。实行这种办法的结果，单纯抄录参考书的现象大体上已经纠正。在学习辅导员方面，除了检查学员的发言提纲，了解学员的准备情况，搜集疑难问题以外，也必须经过充分准备，作出每一个“课堂讨论”题目的总结提纲。
    另外，和“课堂讨论”发言提纲相关联的是“课堂讨论”题目。根据一年来的经验，我们认为拟定题目时，一方面要适当指出准备发言提纲的中心，而另一方面要避免限制学员的思想。“课堂讨论”的题目，既不要失于笼统，也不要失于零碎。比较好的“课堂讨论”题目，应在一个中心问题之下提出几个重点，以逐步引导学员去练习对一个中心问题作有系统和全面的分析和说明。
    二、怎样指导发言
    每一个问题的“课堂讨论”，都必须经过两个阶段：先由学员发言，最后学习辅导员总结。
    在“课堂讨论”的发言中，过去我们发现两种偏向：一是学员们机械依照发言提纲，各说一套，将
    “课堂讨论”变成互不联系，死气沉沉的一个个孤立的发言；一是不能抓住主要问题深入讨论，只是在枝节问题上争论不休，或是扯得过远，不着边际。“课堂讨论”必须有领导有重点地进行，每一个人的发言，都应成为“课堂讨论”过程中不可分割的一部分。所以，除了最先发言的人可以完全按照事先准备的发言提纲来分析和说明问题以外，后来发言的人都必须针对前面的发言来发表自己的意见，肯定或补充其正确的，批判其错误的，不能够机械地按照自己的提纲发言。因此，每一个人在讨论过程中，都必须密切注意别人的发言，补充和修正自己的发言提纲，为自己的发言作准备。
    学习辅导员在指导“课堂讨论”发言时的责任，就是及时提出明确的讨论中心，指导讨论的方向，纠正发言中的偏差。特别要及时明确提示讨论中的分歧点，以指导大家使讨论逐步深入。另外在一个中心问题讨论的发展过程中，还要善于灵活地提出和中心问题密切相关的新问题。为了较全面地检查学员的理解程度，学习辅导员还应尽量照顾到发言的普遍性，有意识地运用指定发言和自由发言相结合的方法。
    三、讨论结束时的总结
    每一个问题，经过大家充分讨论之后，学习辅导员要根据自己事先准备好的总结提纲，结合大家的发言，作出这一问题的讨论总结。学习辅导员要作好总结，必须注意两个问题：第一，总结的目的，在使学员从复杂纷乱的意见中得出明确的结论。为了使学员便于理解和记忆，总结就需要扼要、明确、具体。第二，总结必须和大家的发言密切联系。总结对大家的发言来说，一方面是大家的发言的概括，一方面又是大家的发言的补充或批判。过去我们有些学习辅导员单是依照事先准备好的总结提纲来作总结，和学员发言脱节，致使许多学员感觉“总结不深刻”、“不解决我的问题”等。因此，学习辅导员在讨论过程中须要吸收大家的意见来丰富自己的总结提纲，将大家的发言内容有批判地“兼容并包”到自己的总结中来。
    四、“课堂讨论”应和小组漫谈相结合
    “课堂讨论”因受时间限制，只能解决学习中的主要问题。因此小组漫谈仍然是必要的，它应该成为“课堂讨论”的准备和补充。
    “课堂讨论”之前，为了使讨论能够顺利地集中解决主要的问题，就必须注意避免把一些名词或零碎问题拿到“课堂讨论”中去，以免在讨论时浪费时间和失去重心。但是必要的名词和某些零碎问题也是必须弄清楚的，这些问题的解决，也将有助于“课堂讨论”的进行，因此在“课堂讨论”之前进行一二次小组漫谈是必要的。
    在“课堂讨论”之后，也应进行小组漫谈。这除了解决“课堂讨论”遗留的枝节问题以外，还应该进一步作补充讨论。尤其是在学“实践论”、“矛盾论”等有关思想方法和工作方法的理论时，在“课堂讨论”中只能联系主要的典型的事例，不能够使每一个同志均联系自己的思想实际作充分的发言，所以进一步普遍而深入地联系实际，还要在小组漫谈中来进行。
    五、选拔培养“课堂讨论”学习辅导员
    正确地选拔和培养学习辅导员，是领导“课堂讨论”的关键问题。学习辅导员要由具有较高理论文化水平的干部担任。目前北京市公安局中级班的学习辅导员，大多是由具有十余年革命历史和一定理论水平的老干部来担任的。
    对学习辅导员的培养和提高，除了行政上设法照顾他们的学习时间、供给参考材料以外，“课堂讨论”准备会是一种好办法。在“课堂讨论”准备会上，经过大家的讨论，可使辅导员明确认识每一个问题的重点，这对掌握“课堂讨论”帮助很大。另外，对一些水平较差的学习辅导员也可以采取“课堂讨论”的形式来开“课堂讨论”准备会，这样对他们会有更大的帮助。
