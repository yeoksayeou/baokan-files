The International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China, after more than two months of diligent and meticulous work, has completed its historic mission and announced to the people of the world the crimes of the United States government in waging bacteriological warfare.

The publication of this document is of great historical significance, not only because of the wide range of materials it collected, but especially because it demonstrated a fair and objective attitude and a highly rigorous scientific spirit, enabling the people of the world to more clearly recognize the crimes of the United States in waging bacteriological warfare, and preventing the aggressors from having any further excuses to quibble and deny. This is a victory for human justice. In the history of the struggle against aggression, this document will undoubtedly occupy the most glorious page.

During the Commission's work, I attended their meetings as a nonvoting participant and received individual members in the laboratory for investigation and research and discussed issues with them on several occasions. Therefore, at the time of the publication of this historical document, I would like to present a brief explanation of some of the key points related to insects.

First, the scope of the Commission's investigation was multifaceted. We can see that the facts related to insects mentioned in the report are not limited to the circumstances of the discovery of insects, scientific identification (including classification, morphology, ecology, etc.), bacterial examination, disease relationships, abnormal phenomena, etc. At the same time, it also noted the qualifications of our staff, working conditions, library equipment, specimen preservation status, etc. They paid even more attention to our sanitary conditions and strength, and deeply felt that "Beijing has now become a city almost without flies and mosquitoes." Due to such multifaceted investigation and research, the Commission's report not only further confirmed the crimes of the United States in waging bacteriological warfare, but also explained why this crime failed to achieve its intended effect.

Second, the Commission's conclusions are based on a series of facts. In the appendix, we can see that there are at least nine facts that prove that insects were spread by the U.S. military:

	(1) Air raid connection: The appearance of these insects is closely related to the intrusion activities of U.S. military aircraft. Andong, Kuandian, Changbai, Shenyang, Fushun, Jinzhou and other areas have all discovered insects along the flight path of U.S. aircraft without exception.

	(2) Eyewitness testimony: The discovery of these insects is not only closely related to the activities of U.S. aircraft, but also has numerous eyewitness testimonies. Many people have seen objects falling, and a large number of insects were subsequently found at the place where they fell.

	(3) Abnormality of discovery site: Many insects were found in places where they should not normally appear. For example, fleas appeared on the ice and snow surface; springtails appeared on the cement grandstand of the Fushun Racecourse, about six meters above the ground, and on the top of a nearby cement round building about twelve meters high.

	(4) Abnormality of appearance season: The seasons in which these insects were discovered were often much earlier than their normal appearance periods. The report's chart indicates that at least twelve kinds of insects and spiders were obviously abnormal in their appearance season, in other words, they appeared in large numbers too early.

	(5) Abnormality of appearance quantity: The appearance of many insects, in addition to appearing in unnatural seasons and unnatural places, is also abnormal in quantity. For example, tens of thousands of black flies were found in Gujiazi, Shenyang; a batch of six or seven thousand houseflies were found in Siping; more significantly, tens of thousands of field crickets were found on the ice and snow surface in Kuandian. We know the living habits of field crickets, not only is it impossible for them to appear in this season, but they should not gather together in such large numbers, let alone be exposed on the snow surface, because their habit is to hide.

	(6) Abnormality of community relationship: Another abnormal phenomenon of these insects is that many species with different living habits often appear mixed together at the same time and place. For example, springtails were found mixed with fleas in Kuandian; near Sigedan in Changbai, midges and field crickets were together; green bottle flies and locusts were found at the same time and place in Maluwan area of Shenyang.

	(7) Abnormality of geographical distribution: The locations where these insects were discovered are all areas where U.S. aircraft intruded, and are mainly concentrated on transportation lines. In most other places at the same latitude and with similar geographical conditions, there were no similar discoveries. This situation is completely different from the natural distribution of insects.

	(8) Abnormality of bacterial carrying phenomenon: We checked typhoid and paratyphoid bacilli from these insects that suddenly appeared in the cold weather of March, from large flies, midges, and dung flies, and anthrax bacilli from houseflies, black flies, specimen insects, and wolf spiders. However, in the normal insects collected in the urban area of Shenyang in June and July of this year, intestinal pathogens were not detected from 710 flies (including 575 large flies). Anthrax bacilli were also not detected from 3,106 flies.

	(9) Connection with the occurrence of epidemic diseases: With the sudden appearance of these insects, rare epidemic diseases also suddenly occurred. Qu Zhanyun, a maintenance foreman at Manjing Station in Northeast China, Wei Liushi, a resident of Anshan, Wang Shuzhi, a teacher at Liu'erbao Elementary School in Liaoyang County, and Tian Chenghe, a farmer in Changshan District of Andong County, all suddenly contracted pulmonary anthrax and anthrax encephalitis, which were rare in Northeast China, after participating in insect catching work.

Third, the arguments in the report have a high degree of objectivity. Although faced with so many facts, there is only one possible conclusion, the committee still considers the opposite arguments in every way, whether these arguments are well-intentioned or hostile. For example:

	(1) Regarding the abnormality of the insect appearance season, some people have put forward the following arguments: First, the constant bombing of gasoline bombs may have locally increased the ground temperature, disrupting the normal life history of various insects and causing them to appear earlier. Second, the winter temperature in Northeast China last year was particularly warm, which may have caused the early appearance of insects. Third, even if the abnormal appearance of insects is not due to abnormal meteorological conditions, certain other natural factors may have played a role in promoting this early appearance. For these arguments, the report has objective discussions and explanations: First, Northeast China has never been bombed by gasoline bombs. Second, the temperature in Northeast China from November 1951 to April 1952 and from November 1950 to April 1951 was not abnormal, as evidenced by charts in the report taking Shenyang and Harbin as examples. Third, even if the factors mentioned in these three arguments could play a role, why are only a relatively small number of species of the numerous insect species in Northeast China affected? Taking black flies as an example, there are four other common species in Northeast China. Under the same influence, why have these species not appeared early? Taking other common flies, such as Fannia Spp., Ophyra Spp., Sarcophaga Spp., etc., there is also no fact that they appeared early.

	(2) Regarding the issue of insects carrying bacteria, some people have emphasized that these insects cannot carry bacteria as an argument based on the reason that some of the airborne insects have not been mentioned in old medical entomology books. Although this argument lacks scientific basis, the report still gives objective consideration and explanation, pointing out that our current concept of the specificity of infectious vectors and storage hosts has long undergone fundamental changes with the progress of science. And everyone knows that the way insects transmit bacteria does not necessarily depend on piercing and sucking blood. Many insects can be used as tools to spread bacteria, as the report points out, they can harm humans and livestock by polluting water sources, plants or other indirect routes. Steinhaus mentioned in his book "Insect Microbiology" published in 1946 that there are more than 30 kinds of insects and ticks that can carry anthrax bacilli; among the airborne insects, we detected not only houseflies, black flies, specimen insects, and wolf spiders carrying this bacterium, but also feathers. These facts fully illustrate that under the long-term and active bacteriological warfare research of the U.S. government, using insects as bacteriological weapons cannot be fully covered by old medical entomology books.

The above points clearly show that the work of the International Scientific Commission was conducted with a highly objective attitude and based on the most rigorous scientific principles.

The purpose of science is to pursue truth and benefit mankind; however, aggressors have used the achievements of science to harm mankind, and at the same time distort facts and obliterate truth. Now the International Scientific Commission has systematically and concretely exposed the crimes of the aggressors in launching bacteriological warfare to the people of the world. In order to safeguard scientific dignity, defend peace and save mankind, the people of the world have seen this report and "should redouble their efforts to save the world from the scourge of war and prevent scientific inventions from being used to destroy mankind."

    国际科学委员会调查美国细菌战报告书内有关昆虫的若干事实
    中国科学院昆虫研究室主任   陈世骧
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会，经过了两个多月来辛勤缜密的工作，业已完成了它的历史任务，把美国政府进行细菌战的罪行向全世界人民公布了。
    这个文件的公布是有着重大历史意义的，不仅是因为它所收集的材料范围广泛，尤其是因为它表现了公正的客观的态度和高度的严密的科学精神，使全世界人民更明确地认识到美国进行细菌战的罪行，使侵略者不能再有所藉口来狡辩抵赖。这是人类正义的胜利，在反侵略斗争史上，这个文件无疑地将占有最光辉的一页。
    在委员会工作的进行中，本人曾列席过他们的会议，并在实验室内多次接待个别委员的调查研究，讨论问题。因此，在这历史性文件发表的时候，特就其中有关昆虫的若干要点，提出来略作说明。
    第一，委员会的调查范围是多方面的。我们可以看到报告书内所举有关昆虫的事实，不仅限于虫子的发现情况，科学鉴定（包括分类、形态、生态等方面），细菌检查、疫病关系、反常现象等等，同时也注意到我们工作人员的资历，工作条件、图书设备、标本保存状态等等。他们更注意到我们的卫生条件和力量，深切地感到“北京现在已成一个几乎没有苍蝇和蚊子的城市了。”由于这样多方面的调查研究，委员会的报告书不但更进一步地证实了美国进行细菌战的罪行，同时也说明了为什么这个罪行没有能够达到它的预期效果。
    第二，委员会的结论是根据于一系列的事实的。在附件中我们可以看到，证明昆虫是美军撒布的事实，至少有下列九项：
        （一）空情联系：这些昆虫的出现，都和美军飞机侵入活动有着密切关联的。安东、宽甸、长白、沈阳、抚顺、锦州等等地区，都是无例外地沿着美机飞行的方向发现了昆虫。
    （二）目击人证：这些昆虫的发现，不仅和美机的活动有着密切联系，并且有众多的人证，有许多人曾看到有物体下落，随即在下落处发现了大量昆虫。
    （三）发现场所的反常：很多昆虫是在它们经常所不该出现的地方发现的。例如跳蚤出现在冰雪面上；黑跳虫出现在抚顺跑马场洋灰看台上离地约六公尺高的地方，及其邻近的高约十二公尺的洋灰圆楼顶上。
    （四）出现季节的反常：发现这些昆虫的季节有很多是远较它们正常出现的时期为早。报告书的图表上指出了至少有十二种昆虫和蜘蛛，在出现季节上显然反常，换言之，它们过早地大量出现。
    （五）出现数量的反常：许多昆虫的出现，除掉出现于不自然的季节和不自然的场所外，在数量上亦是反常的。例如：沈阳孤家子发现的黑蝇有数万之多；四平的家蝇一批就有六、七千头；更显著的是宽甸的油葫芦为数成万地在冰雪面上被发现。我们知道油葫芦的生活习性，不但不可能在这个季节出现，而且也不会如此众多地聚集在一起，更不应该暴露在雪面上，因为它的习性是要掩藏起来的。
    （六）群落关系的反常：这些昆虫的另一反常现象是许多生活习性不同的种类，常在同时同地混合出现。例如在宽甸发现的黑跳虫夹杂着跳蚤；在长白发现的四格弹附近，有摇蚊和油葫芦在一起；在沈阳马路湾一带发现绿蝇的同时、同地，也发现了飞蝗。
    （七）地理分布的反常：发现这些昆虫的地点，都是美国飞机侵入活动的地区，而且主要是集中在交通线上。在同一纬度同样地理条件下的其他大部分地方，却没有类似的发现。这种情况和昆虫的自然分布状态绝不相同。
    （八）带菌现象的反常：我们从这些在三月寒冷天气里突然出现的昆虫，从大家蝇、摇蚊和粪蝇中检查出了伤寒和副伤寒杆菌，从家蝇、黑蝇、标本虫和狼蛛中检查出了炭疽杆菌。但是在今年夏季六七月内，在沈阳市区收集的正常昆虫，从七一○只蝇子中（内有大家蝇五七五只）却并未检查出肠系病原菌。从三一○六只蝇子中，也没有检查出炭疽杆菌。
        （九）疫病发生的联系：随着这些昆虫的突然出现，罕见的疫病也突然发生了。东北满井车站养路工长曲占云、鞍山市民魏刘氏、辽阳县刘二堡小学教员王淑芝、安东县长山区农民田成和，都在参加捕虫工作后突然感染了东北从来罕见的肺炭疽病和炭疽性脑炎。
    第三，报告书内的论证是具有高度客观性的。虽然面对着这许多事实，只有一个可能的结论，但是委员会仍处处考虑到相反方面的论调，不管这些论调是善意的或是敌意的。例如：
    （1）对于昆虫出现季节的反常，有人曾提出以下几种论辩：其一、认为汽油弹的不断轰炸，也许会局部地增高了地温，扰乱了各种昆虫的正常生活史，使它们提早出现。其二、认为去年东北冬季气温特别暖和，可能因此引起昆虫的提早出现。其三，认为昆虫的反常出现，即使不是由于气象上的反常情况，但是某些其它的自然因素可能发生作用，促成了这种提前出现。对于这些论辩，报告书内都有客观的讨论与解释：第一，中国东北从未被汽油弹轰炸过。第二、中国东北一九五一年十一月至一九五二年四月和一九五○年十一月至一九五一年四月的气温并不反常，以沈阳、哈尔滨两地为例，报告书内有图表可证。第三、纵使这三种论辩所讲的因素能够发生作用，则以东北昆虫种类的众多，为什么只有比较少数的种类受到了影响。以黑蝇来讲，东北常见的另有四种，在同样的影响下，为什么这些种类未能提前出现？以其它常见蝇类来讲，如小家蝇类（FanniaSpp.）小黑蝇类（Ophyra Spp.）麻蝇类（Sarcophaga Spp.）等类，也都没有提前出现的事实。
        （2）对于昆虫的带菌问题，有人曾根据一部分空投昆虫在旧式的医学昆虫学书内没有被提到过的理由，强调着这些昆虫不能带菌，来作为论辩。虽然这个论辩缺乏科学根据，但报告书内仍给予客观的考虑与说明，指出了目前我们对于传染媒介和存储宿主的特殊性的观念，早已随着科学的进步，起了基本的改变。而且谁都知道，昆虫传播病菌的途径不一定要靠刺吸血液，许多昆虫都可能被利用作传播病菌的工具，正如报告书内所指出，它们可以经过污染水源、污染植物或其它间接的途径来为害人类和家畜。斯太因霍斯（Steinhaus）在一九四六年他所著的昆虫微生物学内所提到的能带炭疽杆菌的昆虫和蜱类，已有三十余种之多；我们在空投昆虫中检验出带有此菌的不仅有家蝇、黑蝇、标本虫和狼蛛，并且还有羽毛。这些事实，充分地说明了在美国政府长期的积极的进行细菌战研究下，以昆虫作为细菌武器，决不是旧式的医学昆虫学书籍所可包涵的。
    以上数点，很明确地显示出国际科学委员会的工作是以高度客观的态度，根据最严格的科学原则进行的。
    科学的目的在于追求真理，造福人类；然而侵略者却利用了科学的成果来祸害人类，同时更歪曲事实，抹杀真理。现在国际科学委员会已把侵略者发动细菌战的罪行，有系统地具体地暴露在全世界人民的面前了。为了维护科学尊严，保卫和平、拯救人类，全世界人民看到了这个报告，“都应加倍努力，使世界免遭战祸，并制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类。”
