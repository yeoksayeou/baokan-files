    Truman Government's Huge Military Spending Causes Inflation
    US Food and Raw Material Prices Rise Sharply
    [By Our Correspondent] Recent sharp rises in US prices are mainly in food and raw materials. According to "U.S. News & World Report" weekly, in terms of food, retail egg prices recently increased by 34 percent, pork prices rose by 14 percent, and cabbage rose by 50 percent. Rising food prices have pushed up the cost of living index. According to materials from the US official Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of living index in August rose to 191.1 (with the average for 1935-1939 as 100), an increase of 12.1 percent since the US launched its war of aggression against Korea, and 2.9 percent compared to a year ago. In terms of raw materials, wholesale prices of steel and aluminum rose by 5 percent, wool rose by 23 percent, and silk rose by 35 percent.
    Since the launch of the war of aggression against Korea, due to huge military spending, the US economy has basically been in a state of inflation. In order to avoid this situation from developing into runaway hyperinflation, Truman asked Congress to pass laws to control prices, wages, credit, and rent. However, by the end of April and early May of this year, the expansion of armaments and war preparations caused a general shrinkage of the purchasing power of the American people, and the market showed signs of sluggish sales, with prices of agricultural products and civilian industrial products generally falling. The big bourgeoisie newspapers in the United States exclaimed that an economic recession was coming. In this situation, the Truman government took some emergency measures in an attempt to temporarily maintain the current false prosperity in the United States. These emergency measures contributed to the recent surge in US prices. For example, after Truman ordered the abolition of credit controls in early May, credit loans for installment purchases increased from 700 million yuan per month in February to 1.4 billion yuan per month in June, an increase of 100 percent. This measure temporarily created a large amount of false purchasing power, reducing inventories and stimulating price increases. At the end of June, a compromise bill to extend price controls was passed by a joint conference of the US Senate and House of Representatives, which actually weakened the control of general prices, especially the cancellation of price controls on fruits and vegetables, causing the prices of certain items to rise. In addition, Truman's approval of steel price increases and droughts in the southeastern and northeastern United States, reducing the supply of grains, cotton, and tobacco, are also reasons for the recent surge in prices.

### 杜鲁门政府庞大军事支出造致通货膨胀  美国食物和原料价格急剧上涨

    杜鲁门政府庞大军事支出造致通货膨胀
    美国食物和原料价格急剧上涨
    【本报讯】最近美国物价急剧上涨，主要是在食物价格及原料价格方面。据“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊称：在食物方面，鸡蛋零售价格最近上涨了百分之三十四，猪肉价格上涨百分之十四，白菜上涨百分之五十。食物价格上涨使生活费用指数上升。据美国官方的劳工统计局的材料，八月份生活费用指数已上涨到一九一点一（以一九三五年——一九三九年的平均数为一○○），比美国发动侵朝战争时涨了百分之十二点一，比一年前涨了百分之二点九。在原料方面，钢及铝的批发价格上涨百分之五，羊毛涨百分之二十三，丝涨百分之三十五。
    自从发动侵朝战争以来，由于庞大的军事支出，美国经济基本上是处于通货膨胀情况中。为了避免这种情况发展为恶性通货膨胀以致一发不可收拾，杜鲁门曾要国会通过法令，管制物价、工资、信用、房租。但到今年四月底五月初，扩军备战造成美国人民购买力的普遍萎缩，市场中呈现了滞销现象，农产品价格及民用工业品价格普遍下跌。美国大资产阶级报刊纷纷惊呼经济萧条即将到来。在这种情况下，杜鲁门政府采取了若干紧急措施，企图暂时维持美国目前的虚假繁荣。这些紧急措施促成了美国最近物价的剧涨。如杜鲁门五月初下令取消信用管制后，分期付款购货办法的信用贷款即自二月份的每月七亿元增到六月份的每月十四亿元，增加了一倍。这项措施暂时造成了大量虚假的购买力，使得存货减少，并刺激物价上涨。六月底美国参众两院联席会议通过一项折衷的延长管制物价法案，实际上是削弱了一般物价的管制，特别是取消了对水果菜蔬价格的管制，使得某些物品价格上升。另外，杜鲁门批准提高钢价以及美国东南部及东北部发生旱灾，谷物、棉花及烟草等供应减少，也是最近物价剧涨的原因。
