Sternly Prohibit the Illegal Activities of Black Lawyers
　　Lin Cheng

　　The old lawyer system in China was a mixture of the extortionist habits of litigation merchants in European and American capitalist countries and the practices of pettifoggers in Chinese feudal society. It was an integral part of the pseudo-legal and pseudo-judicial system by which the Kuomintang reactionary government oppressed the people. Old lawyers were actually accomplices of the reactionary ruling class in oppressing the people. With the victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the overthrow of the Kuomintang reactionary regime and its pseudo-legal system, the old lawyer system was also abolished by the People's Government in accordance with Article 17 of the Common Program, which stipulated "abolishing all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppressed the people." In 1950, the Central Ministry of Justice also issued a notice to all regions to ban the activities of black lawyers. However, in the "Three-Anti" struggle, judicial organs in various regions exposed that many black lawyers were still engaged in various illegal activities. Some former lawyers in Shanghai changed their "law firms" into accounting, translation, or document preparation firms and real estate leasing offices; some nominally held positions as clerks, directors, managers, and secretaries in private enterprises, but in reality, they still served as "legal advisors." Peng Changzhen, a black lawyer in Beijing, handled dozens of lawsuits for people after liberation and served as a "permanent legal advisor" for three companies, receiving monthly salaries. According to the preliminary confessions of 86 black lawyers in Guangzhou, they had undertaken 526 lawsuits in the past three years, extorting five hundred million yuan in RMB from litigants.

　　Most black lawyers are former old lawyers, pettifoggers, old judicial personnel, and hoodlums. They and the old judicial personnel retained by the People's Courts are mostly old classmates, colleagues, or relatives, and have all kinds of connections with each other. Through bad elements in the courts, black lawyers can help litigants win lawsuits or reduce sentences, from which they solicit rewards; bad elements in the courts also rely on black lawyers to introduce "business" to them, from which they embezzle and accept bribes. For example, the crimes of embezzlement and perversion of justice committed by Shi Jinghou and Gu Yushang, etc., of the Supreme People's Court, were often committed in collusion with black lawyers such as Tu Zhanhua and Dong Yuanxun. When Gu Yushang handled a case of a certain profiteer concealing enemy property, he accepted a bribe of 46.6 million yuan through the introduction of black lawyer Tu Zhanhua and ruled the profiteer innocent. Tu Zhanhua also seized 19.4 million yuan from it. The loss caused to the state was more than 250 million yuan.

　　In some places, the illegal activities of black lawyers are organized and planned. Zheng Zigeng, Chen Jianzhong, and other black lawyers in Fuzhou gathered many pettifoggers and hoodlums, often holding meetings to report and study the situation and methods of attacking the People's Courts. More than 70 black lawyers lived near the People's Courts of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City. They set up liaison stations, using "teahouses," "hotels," or "poetry societies" as cover for illegal activities. The liaison stations had three agencies specifically for bribing bad elements in the courts and a dozen "brokers" for bribery; another group of people specialized in soliciting "business." More than 50 judicial personnel of the People's Court of Fuzhou City were "pulled over" by them. According to the materials exposed in the "Three-Anti" movement, on average, one out of every ten cases handled by the People's Courts of Fujian Province and Fuzhou City involved embezzlement and bribery. In more than 570 bribery cases that have been investigated and verified, more than 95% were judged with distorted policies and regulations, so that illegal bourgeois elements were able to win lawsuits or reduce sentences.

　　In some places, black lawyers and their accomplices have tried every means to infiltrate the People's Courts in order to facilitate their illegal activities. Liu Qiyuan, a black lawyer in Fuzhou, sent his son Liu Yijie to work in the People's Court of Fujian Province. Liu Yijie colluded with Li Wenda, who was sent by a certain unscrupulous capitalist to the Provincial People's Court to act as a "mole," and successively stole more than 20 unpublished principles from the Fuzhou Municipal People's Court in handling housing disputes and cases of undermining finance for Liu Qiyuan and others to refer to when conducting activities outside. In Wenzhou City, Zhejiang Province, black lawyers and pettifoggers, through the introduction of old judicial personnel of the Municipal People's Court, infiltrated the Municipal People's Court in large numbers, accounting for one-third of the cadres of the entire court. There were very many cases of them colluding internally and externally to extort and blackmail.

　　One of the important methods used by black lawyers to carry out illegal activities is to swindle and bluff in the name of responsible cadres of the People's Court. For example, Liu Chunyuan, a black lawyer in Beijing, often falsely claimed that he "was from the same hometown as a certain court president and had lived in the same room. I can ask the president to handle whoever is in a lawsuit." Using this despicable means, he successively defrauded the parties of six taels of gold, five bolts of white cloth, and 1.04 million yuan in RMB in the second half of 1949 alone. Many similar situations have also been discovered in other cities.

　　Another method of black lawyers' activities is to deliberately pick quarrels and stir up lawsuits, making simple cases very complicated and causing the parties to be involved in lawsuits for a long time. Yiqun Medal Factory in Shenyang City was involved in a small dispute due to the relocation of public housing. Chen YuKun, a black lawyer, wrote pleadings and appeals for the factory, which caused the factory to be entangled in litigation up to three trials, and the case was delayed for as long as a year and a half. Their activities have a very bad impact on the unity of the people and the order of society.

　　In addition, some black lawyers also seize the small flaws of the parties and carry out threats and blackmail. For example, a certain store in Beijing concealed the property of a traitor and asked black lawyers Liang Fengming and Ren Zongxian to "dredge relations." Afterwards, Liang Fengming demanded 35 million yuan. The manager of the store was unwilling to pay so much money, and Liang threatened, "If you don't give me the money, I will accuse you of bribery and concealing enemy property." Fearing exposure, the manager had no choice but to pay. In addition, some parties originally did not commit offenses that were punishable by imprisonment, but black lawyers threatened them with imprisonment and defrauded them of huge sums of money.

　　The above facts show that black lawyers are the loyal "bodyguards" of lawbreakers and criminals; at the same time, they are also accomplices of corrupt elements in the People's Courts. They take the laboring people as the object of oppression and the property of the state as the target of attack. Many lawbreakers and even counter-revolutionaries have escaped the sanctions of the people's laws under the evil planning of black lawyers. They are destroyers of social order and one of the obstacles to national construction. People's governments at all levels must combine with the judicial reform work currently underway to strictly prohibit all illegal activities of black lawyers. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to expose and report all the crimes of black lawyers that endanger the country and the people, based on the policy of combining punishment with education, and to give necessary sanctions to those who have committed serious crimes and aroused great public indignation, and to educate and transform them.

    严厉禁止黑律师的不法活动
    林　诚
    中国的旧律师制度，是欧美资本主义国家诉讼商人的敲诈习气加上中国封建社会的讼棍作风的混合体，是国民党反动政府压迫人民的伪法统和伪司法制度的一个组成部分。旧律师实际上是反动统治阶级压迫人民的帮凶。随着中国人民革命的胜利，国民党反动政权及其伪法统的被推翻，旧律师制度也被人民政府依照共同纲领第十七条“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度”之规定，予以废除了。中央司法部在一九五○年并通报各地取缔黑律师活动。但各地司法机关在“三反”斗争中，暴露出仍有许多黑律师在进行各种不法活动。上海市的旧律师，有的把“律师事务所”改为会计、翻译或代办文书的事务所和房地产经租处；有的在私营企业中挂名担任文书、董事、襄理、秘书等职务，而实际上则仍担任着“法律顾问”。北京市黑律师彭昌桢，解放后曾代人办理数十件诉讼案，并担任着三家的“常年法律顾问”，按月领薪。据广州市八十六个黑律师的初步坦白，他们三年来包揽诉讼达五百二十六件，向诉讼当事人敲诈勒索的款项达人民币五亿元。
    黑律师大多数是过去的旧律师、讼棍、旧司法人员和流氓。他们和人民法院留用的旧司法人员多是旧同学、同事或亲友，相互间有着千丝万缕的联系。黑律师通过法院中的坏分子，可以替诉讼当事人打赢官司或减免罪刑，从中索取报酬；法院中的坏分子也依靠黑律师给介绍“生意”，从中贪赃受贿。如最高人民法院贪污犯史靖侯、顾裕尚等贪赃枉法的罪行，有不少是和黑律师屠占华、董元勋等共同干的。顾裕尚在处理某奸商隐匿敌产案时，通过黑律师屠占华的介绍，受贿四千六百六十万元，即判决这个奸商无罪。屠占华也从中攫得一千九百四十万元。给国家造成的损失则在二亿五千万元以上。
    有的地方，黑律师的违法活动是有组织、有计划的。福州市黑律师郑梓耕、陈建中等纠合许多讼棍流氓，经常集会，汇报和研究向人民法院进攻的情况和办法。福建省和福州市人民法院附近住着的黑律师达七十多名。他们设立联络站，以“茶馆”、“酒店”或“诗社”作掩护，进行非法活动。联络站设有三个专门向法院坏分子行贿的办事机关和十几个行贿“经纪人”；另一部分人专事兜揽“生意”。福州市人民法院的司法工作人员被他们“拉过去”的达五十多人。根据“三反”运动中揭发出来的材料，福建省和福州市两个人民法院平均每办十案，即有一案有贪赃受贿情事。在已查明的五百七十多起贿赂案件中，百分之九十五以上被作了歪曲政策法令的判决，使不法资产阶级分子获得了胜诉或减免了罪刑。
    有些地方，黑律师和他们的同谋者为了便于进行非法活动，还千方百计地钻入人民法院。福州市黑律师刘启元派其子刘以杰钻入福建省人民法院工作，刘以杰又和某不法资本家派到省人民法院充当“坐探”的李文达勾结一起，先后偷出福州市人民法院处理房屋纠纷和破坏金融案中二十多条没有公布的原则，供刘启元等在外活动时参考。浙江省温州市的黑律师和讼棍们经过市人民法院的旧司法人员介绍，大批打入市人民法院工作，竟占了全院干部的三分之一。他们内外勾结，共同敲诈勒索的事件非常多。
    黑律师进行非法活动的重要方法之一，是假借人民法院负责干部的名义，招摇撞骗。如北京市黑律师刘春元时常诈称他“和某法院院长是同乡，曾同屋居住，谁打官司我可以托院长办。”他使用这种卑鄙手段，仅在一九四九年下半年即先后骗取当事人黄金六两、白布五疋，人民币一百零四万元。其他城市也发现许多类似情形。
    黑律师活动的另一方法，是故意挑词架讼，使简单案情变得非常复杂，使当事人长期缠讼。沈阳市艺群奖章工厂因迁让公房发生小纠纷而涉讼，黑律师陈宇锟代该厂写诉辩状、抗告状，竟使该厂一直缠讼至三审，案件拖延达一年半之久。他们的活动，对于人民的团结和社会的秩序都有极坏的影响。
    另外一些黑律师，还抓住当事人的小辫子，进行威胁敲诈。如北京某商店隐匿汉奸财产，托黑律师梁凤鸣、任宗显给“疏通”。事后梁凤鸣索款三千五百万元。该店经理不愿出这么多钱，梁即威胁说：“你如果不给钱，我就告你行贿和隐匿敌产。”该经理恐事泄，只好照付。另外有些当事人所犯的过错本来不够判刑，黑律师却以判刑相胁，诈取巨款。
    以上事实说明，黑律师是违法犯罪分子的忠实“镖客”；同时也是人民法院中的贪污分子的同谋犯。他们以劳动人民为压榨的对象，以国家财产为进攻的目标。许多违法分子甚至反革命分子，在黑律师的罪恶策划之下逃脱了人民法律的制裁。他们是社会秩序的破坏者，是国家建设的障碍之一。各地人民政府必须结合目前正在进行的司法改革工作，严厉禁止一切黑律师的不法活动。必须依据惩办与教育相结合的方针，发动群众揭发、检举一切黑律师危害国家和人民的罪行，对那些罪恶严重、民愤极大的，给以必要制裁，教育改造他们。
