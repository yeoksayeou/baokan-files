Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 9th: The U.S. Air Force once again barbarously bombed the peaceful residents of Pyongyang City on the 6th. From 9:00 PM to 9:40 PM on the 6th, U.S. heavy bombers repeatedly attacked the northern district of Pyongyang nine times, dropping 591 bombs on Sadori 3-ri, destroying more than 100 civilian houses and 7,400 *pyong* of farmland, killing 24 residents and injuring 17, the vast majority of whom were women and elderly. The local People's Hospital and a movie theater that had been closed for a long time were also damaged. Two patients living in the hospital were killed because they could not escape in time.

On the afternoon of the 6th, U.S. aircraft also bombed and strafed residential areas in the eastern coast, Sariwon, Anju, and other places.

All of these residential areas subjected to the barbarous bombing by U.S. aircraft, including houses, thatched huts, hospitals, and theaters, are referred to by the U.S. Air Force in their war reports as "manufacturing and supply centers," "places storing war materials," or vaguely as "buildings."

The Korean people feel extremely indignant at the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors. They are raising their vigilance and, under the leadership of the government, are further strengthening air defense measures. Therefore, despite the U.S. Air Force's frenzied bombing and strafing, the number of casualties among the people is decreasing day by day. The U.S. aggressors' attempt to use bombs to destroy the heroic Korean people's will to resist is doomed to failure.

    美机又滥炸平壤等地居民区
    【新华社平壤九日电】美国空军在六日对平壤市的和平居民又一次进行了野蛮的轰炸。六日下午九时到九时四十分，美国重轰炸机接连九次袭击平壤北区，在毫无军事目标的寺洞三里投掷了五百九十一颗炸弹，又毁坏了民房一百多所、田地七千四百坪，杀死了居民二十四人、杀伤了十七人，其中绝大多数是妇女和老人。当地的人民医院和久未开放的电影院也遭到了破坏，居住在医院里的两个病人，因躲避不及而牺牲。
    六日下午，美国飞机并轰炸扫射东海岸、沙里院、安州等地的居民区。
    所有这些受到美机野蛮轰炸的居民区，房屋、茅舍、医院、剧场，在美国空军发表的战报中都是被称为“制造及供应中心”、“储藏战争物资的地方”，或被含含糊糊地称为“建筑物”的。
    朝鲜人民对于美国侵略者的暴行，感到十分愤慨。他们正提高警惕，在政府的领导下进一步加强防空措施。因此，尽管美国空军疯狂进行轰炸扫射，人民伤亡数字正日益减少。美国侵略者妄想用炸弹来摧毁英雄的朝鲜人民的抗敌意志的企图，是注定要失败的。
