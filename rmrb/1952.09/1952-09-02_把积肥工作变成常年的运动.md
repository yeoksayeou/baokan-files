    Turn Manure Collection into a Year-Round Movement

    To the Editors: In mid-August, the leading organs of the Eighth District of Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, mobilized the masses to widely open up sources of manure, repair and clean horse stables, cattle pens, pigsties, and toilets, and excavate moats and manure pits, preparing enough fertilizer for 90 percent of the district's cultivated land for next year (the fertilizer for the remaining land will be prepared next spring). By August 20th, 80 percent of the plan had been completed.

    Recently, we went down to inspect and found some problems. First, farmers have not yet established the idea of ​​collecting fertilizer year-round, so they still lack long-term planning. Some villages and hamlets only pay attention to cutting green grass and pressing green manure, but do not pay attention to repairing toilets and accumulating manure. Second, the work of fertilizer storage is neglected. Most villages and hamlets have accumulated more fertilizer in half a month than in a whole year in the past, but it is not well stored. In addition, the quality of fertilizer accumulated in some villages and hamlets is not good, and individual villages and hamlets have not yet completed the plan. These problems should be addressed promptly.

    把积肥工作变成常年的运动
    编辑同志：松江省五常县八区领导机关在八月中旬发动群众广泛地开辟粪源，修补和清理马棚、牛圈、猪圈、厕所，挖掘濠沟、粪坑，给全区百分之九十的耕地准备明年足够的肥料（其余土地的肥料在明春弄好）。到八月二十日止，已完成计划的百分之八十。
    最近我们下去检查，发现了一些问题。第一是农民还没有树立常年积肥的思想，因此还缺乏长远打算。部分村、屯只注意割青草压绿肥，却不注意修厕所积粪。第二是忽视肥料保管工作。绝大部分村、屯半个月中积的肥料，比往年一年积的还多，但没有很好保管。另外，有的村、屯积的肥料质量不好，有个别村、屯还没有完成计划。这些问题都应注意及时解决。
