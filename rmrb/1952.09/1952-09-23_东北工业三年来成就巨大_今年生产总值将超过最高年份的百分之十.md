Xinhua News Agency report: Northeast China's industrial construction has achieved great success in the past three years. By the end of this year, the restoration and transformation of Northeast China's industry will be basically completed. The total output value of public and private industries will exceed the highest production level during the Japanese puppet regime—1943—by more than ten percent. The production volume of various major industries such as steel, machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, textiles, rubber, paper making, and glass, calculated at fixed prices, has exceeded the historical highest production level. Coal, iron, and electricity generation will approach the pre-war peak levels. To prepare conditions for the large-scale economic construction of the entire country, the region began large-scale basic construction with a focus on key projects in 1952, and the construction of some new types of factories and mines has already begun.

Northeast China's industry suffered serious damage from the Japanese puppet regime and the Kuomintang reactionary government during the late stages of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. When Northeast China was fully liberated at the end of 1948, the actual production capacity of Northeast China's industry was only about twenty percent of that in 1943. In order to rapidly rebuild this severely damaged industrial base, the region launched restoration and transformation efforts beginning in 1949. The state invested a large amount of capital and transferred tens of thousands of cadres from various departments to participate in industrial construction. Over the past three years, Northeast China's industry has undergone a historically significant transformation. In terms of industrial output: the annual output of factories and mines under the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department increased by 35 percent in 1950 compared to 1949, and by another 28 percent in 1951 compared to 1950. The planned output value of state-owned and local state-owned industries in 1952 will increase by 41.5 percent compared to 1951, and if the figures for increased production and savings are added, it will greatly exceed this proportion. Under the leadership and support of the state-owned economy, private industry has also greatly developed in the past three years. If the total output value of private industry in 1949 is taken as 100, it increased to 142.4 in 1950, 205.1 in 1951, and in the first half of 1952, it increased by another 8.6 percent compared to the same period in 1951. In terms of the proportion of industry and agriculture in the national economy: in 1949, industry accounted for only 35 percent (agriculture accounted for 65 percent); in 1950, it increased to 43 percent; in 1951, it further increased to 52.6 percent; and in 1952, it will increase to 55.9 percent, thereby bringing the proportion of industry and agriculture in Northeast China to the highest level of 1943.

The basic completion of the restoration and transformation of Northeast China's industry has freed it from the backwardness of a colonial economy. Although Northeast China's industry under Japanese imperialism had a relatively large base, it was colonial in nature. The entire industry was subordinate to the Japanese industrial system, becoming a base for the Japanese to plunder raw materials. As a result, the machinery manufacturing industry was extremely weak, and most general precision machinery, large machinery, electrical machinery, and some important industrial equipment relied on foreign imports. The equipment in some industrial sectors was extremely unbalanced, for example, the steel industry exhibited an abnormal state of high ironmaking capacity but low steelmaking and steel rolling capacity. Since the start of the restoration and transformation of Northeast China's industry in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have consistently adhered to the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry and manufacturing industry, and realizing the transformation of the national economy by first restoring the industry of production means. Therefore, in a very short period of time, the proportion of heavy industry and manufacturing industry in the entire industry has changed significantly. For example, Northeast China's machinery industry, which accounted for only 6.7 percent of the entire industry at its peak in 1943, will increase to 12.5 percent in 1952, greatly exceeding the level of the old era. The number of new products in the machinery industry has increased to nearly 1,000, and large, precision machinery that could not be manufactured in the past, such as universal milling machines, herringbone gear planers, and precision mandrel beds, can now be manufactured domestically. During the Japanese puppet regime, the vast majority of senior managers, engineers, and skilled technical workers in Northeast China's industry were Japanese. Japanese imperialists never taught their technology and experience to Chinese workers. In order to improve enterprise management capabilities and technical levels, the Northeast working class, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, has demonstrated a high degree of creativity and labor enthusiasm, and has worked hard to learn from the advanced experience and technology of the Soviet Union. As a result, decisive advanced production experiences have emerged in various enterprise departments one after another. For example, the advanced experiences vigorously promoted this year include: high-speed cutting, rapid cutting, and multi-tool multi-edge cutting methods in the machinery industry, the method of organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts, and Yang Shou-xun's sand casting method; periodic coal mining, Cui Guoshan's rapid tunneling method, Ma Wenzhi's rapid drilling method, and Shi Yuhai's team's safe production experience in the coal mining industry; rapid steelmaking in open-hearth furnaces in the steel industry; labor division specialization in the electrical appliance industry; Su Changyou's bricklaying method, Yang Dezhong's plastering method, and Xie Wanfu's woodworking assembly line method in basic construction; load adjustment methods and rapid maintenance experience in the power industry; rapid cooking methods in the paper industry; and Li Chuanjiang's workshop and Zhang Wenfu's team's oil production experience in the food industry. Some of these advanced experiences belong to production management, while others belong to production technology. All of these are the result of the combination of the Northeast working class's labor enthusiasm and scientific technology. It has promoted the rapid changes in Northeast China's industrial production and continuously increased labor productivity. Currently, labor productivity in Northeast China's industrial departments is generally 40 to 50 percent higher than during the Japanese puppet regime; some units have even increased it by one to several times, which shows that Northeast China's industry has gradually reached a relatively advanced level.

After three years of arduous efforts, Northeast China's industrial construction has, on the basis of nearing the end of the restoration stage, launched large-scale basic construction with a focus on key projects. This year's total basic construction volume has increased by 125 percent compared to 1951, and the construction area has increased by 100 percent; the funds invested by the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department in new construction projects (including reconstruction) have increased from 25 percent of the total investment in 1949 to 90 percent this year. In order to ensure the completion of basic construction tasks, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government have timely shifted the focus of industrial leadership to basic construction. All enterprise units have transferred a large number of capable cadres and technical workers to basic construction posts. The strength of basic construction has been greatly enhanced in steel, iron, coal, electricity, machinery, non-ferrous metals and other enterprises. In order to speed up construction and ensure project quality, Northeast China's basic construction units have vigorously strengthened political work in this year's construction, launched a movement to establish various responsibility systems and promote advanced experience. At present, various major responsibility systems have been generally established in more than one hundred construction sites, and this work will lay a solid foundation for all construction units to implement strict planned management and economic accounting systems in the future.

    东北工业三年来成就巨大
    今年生产总值将超过最高年份的百分之十
    【新华社讯】东北工业建设三年多来获巨大成就。今年年底，东北工业的恢复改造工作将基本完成，公、私营工业生产总值将超过日伪统治时期生产水平最高年份——一九四三年的百分之十以上，各种主要工业如钢、机械、电器、化学、纺织、橡胶、造纸和玻璃等的生产量，以固定价格计算，已超过了历史上的最高生产水平，煤、铁、发电将接近战前最高水平。为了给全国大规模经济建设准备条件，自一九五二年起，全区开始了有重点的大规模基本建设，一些新型的工厂、矿山的兴建工程业已开始。
    东北工业在抗日战争末期和解放战争时期，曾遭受日伪和国民党反动政府的严重破坏，一九四八年末东北全境解放时，东北工业的实际生产能力仅及一九四三年的百分之二十。为了把这个备遭破坏的工业基础迅速地重建起来，从一九四九年起，全区工业展开了恢复和改造的工作；国家投入了大量资金，并从各个部门抽调了上万的干部来参加工业建设。三年多来，东北工业已发生了一个具有历史意义的变化。在工业产量方面：东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿的年产量，一九五零年比一九四九年增长了百分之三十五，一九五一年又较一九五零年增长了百分之二十八，一九五二年国营和地方国营工业的计划产值，将比一九五一年提高百分之四十一点五，如加上增产节约的数字则将大大超过这个比例。在国营经济领导和扶助下，三年来，私营工业也有很大发展。如以一九四九年私营工业的生产总值为一百，则一九五零年增长到一百四十二点四，
    一九五一年增长到二百零五点一，一九五二年上半年比一九五一年同期又增长了百分之八点六。在国民经济中工农业的比重方面：一九四九年，工业的比重仅占百分之三十五（农业占百分之六十五），
    一九五零年就增加到百分之四十三，一九五一年更增加到百分之五十二点六，一九五二年将增加到百分之五十五点九，从而将使东北工农业的比重达到一九四三年的最高水平。
    东北工业恢复与改造工作的基本完成，已使东北工业摆脱了殖民地经济的落后性。过去在日本帝国主义统治下的东北工业，基础虽较庞大，但却是殖民地性质的。整个工业附属于日本工业的体系，成为日寇掠夺原料的基地，因而机器制造工业极为薄弱，一般的精密机械、大型机械、电气机械和若干重要的工业器材，绝大部分都依赖国外输入；若干工业部门的设备极不均衡，例如钢铁工业的设备，就显出制铁能力大而制钢、轧钢能力小的畸形状态。从一九四九年开始东北工业的恢复和改造工作以来，中国共产党和人民政府始终坚持着以发展重工业和制造工业为主的方针，以首先恢复生产手段的工业，来实现国民经济的改造。因此，在很短时期内，重工业、制造工业在整个工业中的比重就有了显著的变化。如东北机械工业，在发展最高时期的一九四三年仅占整个工业比重百分之六点七，在一九五二年就将增长到百分之十二点五，大大超过了旧时代的水平。机械工业中的新产品已增加到近一千种，过去不能制造的大型、精密机械如万能铣床、人字牙轮刨床和精密樘床等，现在都已能够自己制造。在日伪时期，东北工业的高级管理人员和工程师以及熟练的技术工人绝大部分是日本人，日本帝国主义者从不向中国职工传授其技术和经验。为了提高管理企业能力和技术水平，三年多来，东北工人阶级在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，发挥了高度的创造性和劳动热情，努力学习了苏联的先进经验和技术，所以在各个企业部门中，都先后出现了有决定意义的先进生产经验。如今年大力推广的先进经验就有：机械工业中的高速切削、快速切削和多刀多刃切削法，按指示图表组织有节奏生产的方法和杨守训翻砂造型法；煤矿工业中的周期采煤，崔国山快速掘进法，马文志快速钻探法和施玉海小组的安全生产经验；钢铁工业中的平炉快速炼钢法；电器工业中的劳动分工专业化；基本建设中的苏长有砌砖法，杨德重抹灰法，谢万福木工流水作业法；电力工业中的调整负荷办法和快速检修经验；造纸工业中的快速蒸煮法；食品工业中的李川江车间和张文富小组的制油经验等。这些先进经验，有的是属于生产管理方面的，有的是属于生产技术方面的。所有这些，都是东北工人阶级的劳动热情和科学技术相结合的成果。它促进了东北工业生产日新月异的变化，使劳动生产率不断提高。目前，东北工业部门的劳动生产率，一般地都比日伪
    时期提高了百分之四十至五十；有的单位甚至提高了一倍到数倍，这就显示了东北工业已逐渐达到了比较先进的水平。
    经过三年来的艰巨努力，东北的工业建设已在恢复阶段接近结束的基础上，展开了有重点的大规模的基本建设。今年基本建设工程总量已比一九五一年增加了百分之一百二十五，建筑面积增加了百分之一百；东北人民政府工业部投入新建工程（包括改建）的资金，已由一九四九年的占全部投资百分之二十五，增加到今年的占百分之九十。为了保证基本建设任务的完成，中共中央东北局和东北人民政府已适时地把工业领导重心转向基本建设。各企业单位都抽调了大批得力干部和技术工人到基本建设岗位上来。在钢、铁、煤、电力、机械、有色金属等企业中，基本建设的力量都已大大增强。为了加快建设速度，保证工程质量，东北各基本建设单位在今年施工中，都大力加强了政治工作，发动群众展开了建立各种责任制度和推广先进经验的运动。目前各种主要责任制已在一百数十个工地中普遍建立，这一工作，将为所有的施工单位今后实行严格的计划管理和经济核算制奠定巩固基础。
