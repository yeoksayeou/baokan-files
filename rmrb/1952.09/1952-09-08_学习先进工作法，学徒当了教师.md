    Learning Advanced Working Methods: Apprentice Becomes Teacher
    Editor: Cheng Yusheng of the Fengtai Vehicle Depot became an apprentice worker last January. Because he was diligent in his studies and willing to delve into the subject matter, he soon passed the examination and was approved for promotion to vehicle fitter. Recently, he was transferred to the Changchun Vehicle Depot to learn the advanced working method of "fast repair of train inspections without detaching the cars." After arriving at the Changchun Vehicle Depot, he learned more than 30 kinds of fast repair methods in just ten days, and was named an outstanding student among 44 trainees. After returning to Fengtai, he taught 47 trainees in ten days.
    The fact that Cheng Yusheng, after only a dozen months of work, was able to become a teacher, educated the old workers who held conservative ideas such as "relying on seniority, old experience, and not believing in new working methods," and at the same time educated the apprentices who thought of themselves as thinking "I can't learn quickly" with backward ideas.

### 学习先进工作法，学徒当了教师

    学习先进工作法，学徒当了教师
    编辑同志：丰台车辆段程玉生去年一月到厂当学徒工，因为他在学习方面肯努力钻研，不久就考试合格被批准提升为车辆钳工了。最近，他又被调去长春车辆段学习“列检不甩车快速修车”先进工作法。到长春车辆段之后，他在短短的十天里，共学会三十多种快速修车方法，并在四十四名学员中，取得优秀学员称号。回到丰台之后，十天的工夫他又教会了四十七个学员。
    程玉生参加工作仅仅十几个月就能当教师的事实，教育了有“依靠年头多，经验老，不相信新工作法”的保守思想的老工人，同时也教育了学徒工认为“自己学不快”的落后思想。
