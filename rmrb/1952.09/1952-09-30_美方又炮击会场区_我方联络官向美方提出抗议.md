Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 29th. On September 28th, at approximately 6 PM, the US side violated the agreement on the Kaesong truce talks meeting area by shelling the Panmunjom meeting area. Two shells landed within the meeting area. That evening, security officers from both sides of the meeting area conducted a joint investigation, unearthing shell fragments within the meeting area. Both material evidence and eyewitness accounts irrefutably confirmed the US side's violation of the agreement. At the liaison officers' meeting on the 29th, our liaison officer lodged a protest with the other side regarding this incident, demanding that they strictly restrain their troops to prevent similar incidents from occurring again. Our liaison officer also pointed out that the other side has continuously violated the agreement, using the meeting area for espionage activities. As recently as September 27th, five plainclothes US agents carrying weapons intruded into the meeting area, attempting to kidnap farmers within the meeting area. When our meeting area military police discovered and pursued them, they immediately fled back to the other side's area. Our liaison officer demanded that the other side pay close attention to this serious violation of the meeting area agreement by the other side's espionage activities and immediately put a stop to it.

On the morning of the 29th, two US meeting area military police officers and a driver crossed the meeting area boundary and intruded into our area, where they were captured by our local troops. Our liaison officer pointed out that personnel from both sides within the meeting area must not cross the meeting area boundary and intrude into the other side's area. However, after the other side's liaison officer admitted the mistake, expressed apology, and issued a receipt, our side handed the other side's trespassing personnel back to them to be taken away. In contrast to the other side's illegal use of the meeting area for espionage activities, our side strictly abides by the agreement and leniently handles the other side's trespassing personnel. Even the other side's liaison officer had to admit our side's "fair attitude." This clearly demonstrates the sharp contrast between the two sides' sincerity towards the armistice negotiations.

    美方又炮击会场区
    我方联络官向美方提出抗议
    【新华社开城二十九日电】九月二十八日下午六时左右，美方违反朝鲜停战谈判会场区协议，炮击板门店会场区。炮弹两枚落在会场区内。当晚双方会场区安全军官进行了共同调查，在会场区内掘出了弹片。人证物证都无可争辩地证实了美方违反协议的行为。我方联络官在二十九日双方联络官会议上，对于这一事件向对方提出抗议，要求对方严格约束其部队，使类似事件不再发生。我方联络官并指出：对方连续不断违反协议，利用会场区进行特务活动。即在九月二十七日就有对方便衣特务五人携带武器侵入会场区，企图绑架会场区内的农民。当我方会场区军事警察发现追赶时，即行逃回对方地区。我方联络官要求对方对于这种严重违反会场区协议的对方特务活动严加注意，并立即予以制止。
    二十九日上午美方会场区军事警察二人及司机一人越出会场区，侵入我方地区，为我方当地部队所捕获。我方联络官指出：会场区内双方人员均不得越出会场区范围，侵入另一方地区。但在对方联络官承认错误，表示歉意并开列收据后，我方将对方越界人员交回对方领去。和对方非法利用会场区进行特务活动相对照，我方严格遵守协议，宽大处理对方越界人员，即使对方联络官也不得不承认我方“态度的公正”。这正形成了双方对于停战谈判诚意的鲜明的对比。
