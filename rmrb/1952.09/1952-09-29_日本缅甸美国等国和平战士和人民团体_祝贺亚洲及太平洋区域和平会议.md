    Famous peace fighters and people's organizations from Japan, Burma, the United States, Nepal, and other countries have sent telegrams, letters, or articles to congratulate the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in Beijing. A congratulatory letter signed by Kushida Fuki, representative of the Japan Democratic Women's Club, stated: We express our hope and joy in congratulating the grand Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. We are very excited as we await this day. First, we Japanese women sincerely apologize for the heinous material and spiritual crimes committed by the Japanese imperialist war of aggression against various countries in the Asian and Pacific region in the past. At the same time, in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, we are now strongly opposing the revival of Japanese militarism and are persistently fighting for this. We do not believe that the powerful troops brought in by foreign countries or the forcibly rebuilt domestic army can guarantee our peace. We believe that the Asian people, who are extremely close in terms of ethnicity and geography, their desire for peace, their courage to dedicate themselves to peace, their spiritual and material cooperation, and their spirit of love and responsibility—only these will guarantee our peace and mutual security. The congratulatory letter concluded: We sincerely request that the representatives of all countries attending the conference intensify their efforts so that this conference can play a significant role in Asian peace, especially in bringing peace to our close neighbor, Korea, as soon as possible. Peace in Korea will be a great force in safeguarding world peace, which is desired by millions of people.
    The congratulatory letter from the All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations confidently reported to peace-loving people in the Asian and Pacific region on the struggles of 300,000 Japanese students demanding peace and freedom. The letter continued: The struggle of all Japanese students is centered on elections, peace conferences, and the fight for national independence and world peace, and it will surely achieve rapid development. In August, the All-China Students' Federation called on Japanese youth who love peace and their motherland to unite and strive for peace so that Japanese youth would no longer suffer the ravages of war. Japanese students have responded to the call of the All-China Students' Federation by uniting students across the country and closely uniting with workers, farmers, and citizens, playing a great role in the struggle for national liberation.
    Du Qingna, Chairman of the Burmese Women's Association and a Burmese representative who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, wrote: The greater the achievements of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, the greater the consolidation of the world peace movement, and the danger of war will be far away. If the people of all countries work harder than they do now to strive for peace, then human lives and property will be spared from the ravages of war. I can assure you that Burmese women share the same heart as women in other countries around the world in striving for peace and opposing war. We firmly believe that the victory of the Asian peace movement will bring peace to the whole world. She said: Burma has suffered the ravages of two wars. Therefore, the Burmese people know very well what war means. We must prevent the use of bacteriological weapons, atomic weapons, and any other kind of weapon of mass destruction of mankind in Burma, Asia, or any other country in the world. Therefore, I would like to express my sincere respect to those great intellectuals who initiated this noble world peace movement and those who are actively working for world peace. To show my respect for them, I am doing my best to implement the resolution on protecting women and children adopted by the Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation in support of world peace. She concluded by wishing the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and the World People's Peace Congress success.
    A telegram from the famous American historian and member of the World Peace Council, W.E.B. Du Bois, stated: On behalf of the fifteen million Black Americans, I extend my warmest congratulations to the Asian people who are working to build world peace. The telegram pointed out: In the United States, we Black people are still second-class citizens, most of whom are deprived of the right to vote, equal opportunities to get jobs and equal pay for equal work, and various civil rights as American citizens. They especially extend their hands to Asia. The telegram concluded: I believe your conference will work in a spirit of brotherhood and cooperation to build a world without war, to eliminate poverty and ignorance, and to promote health and morality.
    A telegram from Mrs. Kamaksha Devi, Chairman of the Nepal Women's Association, stated: In such a short time after the end of World War II, even before the people of the war-torn countries have been able to catch their breath, the imperialists are plotting to create a third world war. The current war in Korea reminds people of this. In this situation, it is only natural that the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is being held in Beijing to ensure and consolidate the cause of peace, economic recovery, and the progress and happiness of the people of all countries in the world. Women in our country have long been directly affected by the pain of imperialist war. They have lost their husbands, sons, and loved ones. The Gurkhas, who serve as mercenaries in the British army, die or become disabled in war, only to consolidate the British imperialists' control over their colonies in Asia and Africa. The telegram concluded: Women in our country pledge to wholeheartedly do their best to support the noble cause of the Peace Conference and the representatives attending the Peace Conference. We believe that with the concerted efforts of people all over the world, we will definitely be able to stop war.

    日本缅甸美国等国和平战士和人民团体
    祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【本报讯】综合新华社消息：日本、缅甸、美国、尼泊尔等国著名和平战士与人民团体，纷纷致电、写信或撰文祝贺即将在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。日本民主妇女俱乐部代表栉田蕗署名的贺信说：我们怀着希望和喜悦的心情祝贺盛大的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。我们非常兴奋地等待着这个日子的到来。首先，我们日本妇女对过去日本帝国主义侵略战争在亚洲及太平洋区域各国所造成的物质上及精神上的滔天罪行，表示诚恳的道歉。同时，为了不再重踏覆辙，我们现在正极力反对日本军国主义的复活，并为此而坚持斗争。我们不相信外国所带进来的强大军队或强制重建起来的我们本国军队能够保障我们的和平，我们认为，在民族和地理上极为亲近的亚洲各国人民对和平的热望，为和平而献身的勇气，彼此间精神上和物质上的合作以及友爱负责的精神——只有这些，才会保障我们的和平及相互的安全。贺信最后说：我们诚恳地请求出席会议的各国代表加紧努力，使这个会议能为亚洲的和平起很大的作用，特别是使我们亲近的邻国朝鲜能够早一天得到和平，朝鲜的和平对保卫千万人希求的世界和平将成为一股极大的力量。
    全日本学生自治会联合总会的贺信，充满信心地向亚洲及太平洋区域的和平人士报告了要求和平、自由的三十万日本学生所进行的斗争的情况。贺信接着说：全日本学生的斗争，正以大选、和平会议、争取民族独立和世界和平为中心来进行，定将获得飞跃的发展。中华全国学生联合会在八月间给日本学生的电文中曾号召热爱和平、热爱祖国的日本青年学生团结起来争取和平，使日本青年不再遭受战争的浩劫。日本学生响应中华全国学生联合会的号召，把全国学生团结在一起，并与工人、农民、市民紧密地团结在一起，在争取民族解放的斗争中，发挥着伟大的力量。
    参加过亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的缅甸列席代表、缅甸妇女协会主席都庆纳撰文说：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的成就有多大，世界和平运动的巩固也就有那样大，而战争的危险将会远远地离开。如果各国人民比现在更加努力地工作来争取和平，那末人类的生命财产就会免受战争的浩劫。我可以向你们保证，缅甸妇女在争取和平反对战争上，和世界其他国家的妇女是一条心的。我们坚信，亚洲和平运动的胜利，将使全世界获得和平。她说：缅甸经受过两次战争的蹂躏。因此，缅甸人民很知道战争意味着什么。我们必须阻止在缅甸或在亚洲或在世界其他任何国家使用细菌武器、原子武器和其他任何种类的大规模毁灭人类的武器。因此，我谨向那些发起这个崇高的世界和平运动的伟大的智者和那些为世界和平积极工作的人，致以衷心的敬意。为了表示我对他们的敬意，我正在尽我最大的力量实现国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会为拥护世界和平而通过的保卫妇女与儿童的决议。她最后祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议与世界人民和平大会成功。
    美国著名历史学家、世界和平理事会理事杜波依斯的贺电说：我代表一千五百万美国黑人向正在努力缔造世界和平的亚洲人民致最热烈的祝贺。电文指出：在美国，我们黑人仍然是第二等的公民，大部分都被剥夺了投票权利、得到工作的平等机会和同工同酬的机会，以及美国公民的各种民权。他们特别向亚洲伸出他们的手。电文最后说：我相信你们的会议将本着兄弟般的和合作的精神，为建立一个没有战争的世界，为消灭贫穷和愚昧，增进健康和道义精神而努力。
    尼泊尔妇女联合会主席卡马克西·德维夫人的电文说：就在第二次世界大战结束后那么短的时间，甚至受战争蹂躏的世界各国人民还没有能喘过气来的时候，帝国主义者又在阴谋制造第三次世界大战了。目前在朝鲜进行的战争，使人想到这一点。在这种情况下，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在北京举行，以保证和巩固和平事业、经济复兴及世界各国人民的进步和幸福，是很自然的。我国妇女很久以来直接受到帝国主义战争的痛苦。她们失掉了丈夫、儿子及亲爱的人。在英国军队中当雇佣兵的廓尔喀人，在战争中死去或者成为残废，只是为了巩固英帝国主义者对亚洲和非洲的殖民地的控制。电文最后说：我国妇女保证衷心地尽力支持和平会议及参加和平会议代表们的崇高事业。我们相信在全世界人民的通力合作下，一定能够制止战争。
