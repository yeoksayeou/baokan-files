Editor's Note: After the publication of the "Report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," a vast number of readers wrote in expressing their enthusiastic support. They all expressed their firm support for and response to the International Scientific Commission's call to stop the crime of using scientific inventions to destroy humanity. They also expressed their willingness to exert their own strength, work hard, and be ready to go to the places where the people need them most, to fight for saving humanity and stopping bacteriological warfare. Many letters unanimously called for people all over the world to unite and jointly stop the shameless crime of bacteriological warfare committed by American imperialism. We have selected a few letters below:

    Fighting to Stop the Invention of Science from Being Used to Destroy Humanity
    Editor: We have carefully read the "Report of the International Scientific Commission Investigating the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" and have conducted thorough discussions. We unanimously express our admiration for the highest degree of objectivity and scientific working methods of the members of the International Scientific Commission; we express our gratitude for their efforts over the past two months to uphold truth and justice. The members of the International Scientific Commission came from six different countries and are all highly respected scientists. After their serious investigation and research, they once again confirmed that American imperialism has carried out inhumane bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China; they confirmed that our country's previous investigation reports were indeed reliable. This irrefutably exposes the original form of the man-eating beast of American imperialism, making American imperialism even more isolated in front of the people of the world. It further inspires the people of the world's hatred of American imperialism and greatly strengthens the power to defend peace. This is a great contribution to the cause of peace.
    We are all engaged in microbiological research. Our task is to eliminate pathogenic bacteria that endanger human beings and protect human health. Therefore, we firmly support and respond to the call of the International Scientific Commission to strengthen our research work and fight to stop the invention of science from being used to destroy humanity.
    All staff members of the Department of Microbiology, Central Institute of Hygiene

    People All Over the World Unite to Stop the Crimes of American Bacteriological Warfare
    Editor: All the faculty, students, and staff of the Peking Union Medical College unanimously and enthusiastically support the International Scientific Commission's report and pay high tribute to the just scientists with human conscience and a sense of justice who participated in the work of this committee. With a pragmatic attitude and scientific working methods, after two months of investigation and laboratory work, they once again irrefutably exposed the facts of American imperialism carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China to the people of the world. After studying this report in detail, many professors and doctors in our college unanimously pointed out that, whether from the perspective of epidemiology, bacteriology, pathology, or public health, this report truly confirms that the people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed become the targets of bacteriological weapons.
    This report once again shows that American imperialism has a very sinister plan for carrying out bacteriological warfare. Professor Jin Yinchang said: "For example, taking the 'Datong Incident,' American imperialism conspired to spread clams containing cholera vibrio in the reservoir, and at the same time bombed the water filtration pool used for disinfection, but did not destroy the pumping station that could deliver drinking water to coastal cities. This kind of sinister method is very obvious."
    However, no matter how viciously American imperialism spreads bacteria and how desperately it tries to cover up its crimes, victory will surely belong to the Chinese and Korean people. The Chinese and Korean people have already achieved brilliant victories on the anti-bacterial warfare front. The report of the International Scientific Commission will enable peace-loving scientists and all just people around the world to further recognize and hate the inhumane crimes of American imperialism, unite to stop the crimes of American bacteriological warfare. American imperialism will surely be punished by the peace-loving people of the world.

    Ready to Dedicate All Our Strength to Stop Bacteriological Warfare
    Editor: After the publication of the International Scientific Commission's report, all the medical staff of our Central Institute of Maternal and Child Health, after careful study and scientific judgment, fully support this report.
    We are medical workers. For the health and happiness of mankind, we fight against disease and death every day. Therefore, we feel extremely angry about the towering crime of American imperialism spreading bacteria. However, we must turn anger into strength. We will never beg for the "conscience" of American imperialists, because beasts have no conscience. All our employees will exert their own strength, work hard, and be ready to go to the places where the people need us most, to fight for saving humanity and stopping bacteriological warfare!
            Trade Union of the Central Institute of Maternal and Child Health

    All Lies Cannot Stand in the Face of Science
    Editor: The report of the International Scientific Commission is a meticulous and rigorous scientific document. It further and more powerfully confirms the crime of American imperialism using bacteriological weapons and exposes the shameless lies of American imperialism's consistent sophistry and denial.
    I am a scientific worker. I greatly admire the strict scientific method used by the members of the International Scientific Commission to analyze events. They connected many things, making them coherent from beginning to end, able to corroborate each other, thus forming some well-documented cases. After this logical step, the International Scientific Commission affirmatively concluded that the United States used bacteriological weapons in Korea and China, fully confirming the pragmatic and highly scientific work of scientists from China and Korea in investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in the past. This shows that truth cannot be distorted. In the face of science, all lies cannot stand.

    广大读者纷纷来信
    拥护国际科学委员会报告书
    编者按：“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”发表后，广大读者纷纷来信表示热烈拥护。他们都表示要坚决拥护并响应国际科学委员会的号召，制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类的罪行。并表示要发挥自己的力量，努力工作，准备着随时到人民最需要的地方去，为拯救人类和制止细菌战而斗争。许多来信一致呼吁，要求全世界人民一致团结起来，共同制止美帝国主义进行细菌战的无耻罪行。现在选登几封来信在下面：
    为制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类而斗争
    编辑同志：我们仔细地阅读了“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会报告书”，并进行了充分的讨论。我们一致对国际科学委员会委员们的最高度的客观态度和科学的工作方法表示敬佩；对他们两个月来为维护真理和正义的努力表示感谢。国际科学委员会的委员们来自六个不同的国家，都是极有威望的科学家。经过他们认真的调查研究，再一次证实了美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国东北进行了灭绝人性的细菌战；证实了我国科学工作以往的调查报告都是确实可靠的。这就无可置辩地暴露了美帝国主义这吃人野兽的原形，使美帝国主义在全世界人民面前更加孤立。进一步激发了全世界人民对美帝国主义的仇恨，大大地增强了保卫和平的力量。对于和平事业，这是一个伟大的贡献。
    我们都是从事微生物学研究的工作人员，我们的任务是消灭危害人类的病原菌，维护人类的健康。因此我们坚决拥护并响应国际科学委员会的号召，加强我们的研究工作，为制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类而斗争。
    中央卫生研究院微生物学系全体工作人员
    全世界人民一致团结起来制止美国细菌战的罪行
    编辑同志：我们中国协和医学院的全体师生员工，一致热烈拥护国际科学委员会报告书，并对参加这个委员会工作的各位公正的、有着人类良心与正义感的科学家们致崇高的敬意。他们以实事求是的态度和科学的工作方法，经过了两个月的调查和实验室工作，在全世界人民面前再一次不可辩驳地揭露了美帝国主义在朝鲜及中国东北地区进行细菌战的事实。我院许多教授、大夫在详细地研究了这个报告后，一致指出：无论是从流行病学、细菌学、病理学以及公共卫生学的观点上来看，这个报告都千真万确地证实了朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标。
    这个报告书再次说明美帝国主义进行细菌战是有着十分毒辣的计划的。金荫昌教授说：“譬如拿‘大同事件’来讲，美帝国主义一方面阴谋用带有霍乱弧菌的蛤蜊散布在蓄水池内，同时又把消毒用的滤水池炸了，而对能输送饮水到沿海各城市的抽水站却一点都不加破坏。这种毒辣手段是很明显的。”
    但是，尽管美帝国主义怎样恶毒地散布细菌，又怎样千方百计地企图掩饰它的罪过，胜利必将属于中朝人民。中朝人民在反细菌战的战线上已经获得了辉煌的胜利。国际科学委员会的报告将使全世界爱好和平的科学家以及所有公正的人们更进一步地认清并憎恨美帝国主义灭绝人性的罪行，一致团结起来制止美国细菌战的罪行。美帝国主义必将受到全世界爱好和平人民的惩罚。
                    中国协和医学院通讯组
    准备为制止细菌战而献出全部力量
    编辑同志：国际科学委员会报告书发表后，我们中央妇幼保健实验院的全体医务工作人员经过认真地研究和科学的判断，完全拥护这个报告书。
    我们是医务工作者。为了人类的健康和幸福，我们天天在和疾病、死亡作斗争。因此，我们对美帝国主义撒布细菌的滔天罪行，感到极度的愤恨。但是，我们要把愤恨化为力量，我们决不祈求于美帝国主义者的“良心”，因为野兽是没有良心的。我们全体职工要发挥自己的力量，努力工作，准备着随时到人民最需要我们的地方去，为拯救人类和制止细菌战而斗争！
            中央妇幼保健实验院工会
    一切谎言在科学面前都站不住脚
    编辑同志：国际科学委员会的报告书是一个缜密谨严的科学文献。它进一步地、更有力地证实了美帝国主义使用细菌武器的罪行，揭穿了美帝国主义一贯狡辩抵赖的无耻谎言。
    我是一个科学工作者。我十分钦佩国际科学委员会的委员们分析事件的严格的科学方法。他们把许多事情联系起来，使首尾联贯，彼此能够印证，因而构成一些有证有据的案件。经过了这种逻辑的步骤，国际科学委员会才肯定地作出了美国在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器的结论，完全证实了中朝两国科学家们过去调查细菌战事实的实事求是和富有高度科学性的工作。这说明真理是不容歪曲的。在科学面前，一切谎言都是站不住脚的。
        中国协和医学院生理科主任教授    张锡钧
