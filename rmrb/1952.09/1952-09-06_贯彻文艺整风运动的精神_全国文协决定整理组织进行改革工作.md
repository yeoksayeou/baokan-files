In order to implement the spirit of the Rectification Movement in Literature and Art, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles (ACFLAC) is actively carrying out reform work and strengthening its professional activities. On August 6th, it convened its fifth expanded meeting of the Standing Committee, which determined a concrete plan for reorganizing the ACFLAC's structure.

The meeting considered that the work of the ACFLAC over the past three years has been effectively paralyzed. The work done is far from meeting objective needs. It has neither systematically launched ideological struggles against erroneous tendencies in literary and art work, nor has it regularly organized writers to engage in creation, criticism, and study activities. In response to the above shortcomings, the meeting decided to rectify the organization and improve its work, so that the ACFLAC can truly become an organization of writers and experts who lead the literary movement and creative thought in name and in fact. The meeting passed the "Plan on Reorganizing the Organization and Improving Work"; and decided to complete the review of all members within three months; establish poetry groups, novel groups, and film and drama literature groups; prepare for the establishment of a children's literature committee; and begin organizing the second group of writers to go into actual struggles, etc.

The "Plan on Reorganizing the Organization and Improving Work" clearly stipulates that the ACFLAC must regularly carry out the following professional activities: 1. Organize writers to participate in actual struggles and engage in creation, promote writers to formulate creation plans, and supervise and inspect the implementation of the plans; 2. Study the problems existing in the literary movement and literary creation, and conduct literary criticism activities; 3. Organize writers' political and artistic studies; 4. Organize writers to participate in various social activities and strengthen the connection between writers and the masses.

The plan stipulates that the reorganization of the ACFLAC's structure will begin with an investigation of the members' situation. According to the membership conditions stipulated in the ACFLAC's charter, the entire membership list will be reviewed and re-registered. The reorganized membership list will be published in newspapers and periodicals. Members must abide by the ACFLAC's charter, participate in certain literary activities, and undertake certain obligations.

The plan specifically stipulates the work of the ACFLAC Standing Committee. The Standing Committee should regularly discuss the ACFLAC's work guidelines and plans, as well as ideological leadership issues related to the literary movement and creation; it should regularly discuss the editorial guidelines and plans of the ACFLAC's official publication "People's Literature," pay attention to the publication of literary works, and assist the work of the Central Institute of Literature, etc. The plan also stipulates the establishment of a "Working Committee of ACFLAC Organs" to implement the resolutions of the Standing Committee and carry out daily work.

    贯彻文艺整风运动的精神
    全国文协决定整理组织进行改革工作
    中华全国文学工作者协会为了贯彻文艺整风运动的精神，正积极进行改革工作，加强业务活动；并在八月六日召开第五次常务委员会扩大会议，确定了整理文协组织的具体方案。
    会议认为三年来全国文协的工作实际处于瘫痪状态，所做工作远不能满足客观的需要，既未能有计划地向文艺工作中的错误倾向展开思想斗争，也未能经常组织作家进行创作、批评和学习的活动。针对以上缺点，会议决定整顿组织，改进工作，使文协真正成为名符其实的领导文学运动和创作思想的作家和专家的组织。会议通过了“关于整理组织改进工作的方案”；并决定在三个月内要全部完成审查会员的工作；建立诗歌小组、小说小组及电影、戏剧文学小组；筹备成立儿童文学委员会；着手组织第二批作家到实际斗争中去等。
    在关于整理组织改进工作的方案中，明确规定了文协必须经常进行下列业务活动：一、组织作家参加实际斗争、进行创作，推动作家拟定创作计划，督促、检查计划的实现；二、研究文学运动和文学创作上所存在的问题，进行文学批评活动；三、组织作家的政治和艺术的学习；四、组织作家参加各种社会活动，加强作家与群众的联系。
    方案中规定：首先从调查会员情况着手整理文协组织，根据文协章程所规定的会员条件，将全部会员名单加以审查，重新举行登记。整理后的会员名单将在报刊上公布。会员必须遵守文协章程，参加一定的文学活动及承担一定的义务。
    方案中具体规定了文协常务委员会的工作。常务委员会应经常讨论文协的工作方针和计划，及有关文学运动和创作上的思想领导问题；应定期讨论全国文协机关刊物“人民文学”的编辑方针和计划，关心文学作品的出版，及帮助中央文学研究所的工作等。方案中并规定成立“文协机关工作委员会”，执行常务委员会的决议和进行日常工作。
