    The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government
    On Awarding Prizes for New Year Picture Creations in 1951 and 1952
    Since the Ministry issued the New Year Picture Creation Award in May 1950, the work on New Year pictures has made great progress in the past two years. In terms of quantity, 41 regions across the country have produced New Year pictures, with more than 400 participating authors, creating a total of more than 1,100 types. The publication volume in 1952 reached 40 million copies, exceeding five times the publication volume in 1950. In terms of quality, the general works can be combined with the people's lives, with the patriotic production and construction, and with the realistic struggle to defend world peace; it plays a certain role in the cultural life of the broad masses of people.
    The New Year picture work is one of the key points of popularizing fine arts. To promote the creation of New Year pictures and improve the quality of works, it is necessary to widely mobilize art workers to participate in creation and strengthen the organizational leadership and ideological leadership of creation. In the past two years, individual regions have gained better experience in this work. The cultural and educational authorities and art groups in various regions should, from now on, raise the organizational leadership of New Year picture creation to an important position.
    Transforming the old folk New Year pictures is an important aspect of carrying out the New Year picture work. This kind of transformation work must rely on the concerted cooperation of new and old authors, and this cooperation must be regarded as a regular work. In the past two years, only individual regions have achieved better results in this work. Art workers across the country should continue to work hard to transform folk New Year pictures in the future.
    In the two years of New Year picture creation, many new authors have emerged, and excellent works have been produced. These works are not only loved by the broad masses of people, but also can be used as a demonstration to improve the level of art creation. In order to consolidate and expand the achievements of New Year picture creation, the Ministry specially organized a New Year Picture Award Committee to evaluate the New Year picture works of the past two years according to the current key points of New Year picture work, and decided on the list of those who should be awarded. After review and approval by the Ministry, it is now announced as follows.

    中央人民政府文化部
    关于一九五一、五二年度年画创作的评奖
    自一九五○年五月本部颁发年画创作奖金后，两年来年画工作有极大的进展。在数量方面，全国已有四十一个地区制作了年画，参加创作的作者有四百余人，创作数量共计一千一百余种，一九五二年的出版数量达四千万份，超过一九五○年的出版数量五倍。在质量方面，一般作品均能与人民生活相结合，与爱国主义的生产建设相结合，与保卫世界和平的现实斗争相结合；在广大人民的文化生活中起有一定的作用。
    年画工作是美术普及工作重点之一，要推广年画创作工作和提高作品的质量，就必须广泛发动美术工作者参加创作、和加强创作的组织领导与思想领导；两年来有个别地区在这一工作上取得了较好的经验。各地文教主管部门与美术团体，今后应将年画创作的组织领导工作提到重要的地位。
    改造民间旧有年画是开展年画工作的重要方面，此种改造工作，必须依靠新旧作者的通力合作，必须把这一合作当作经常的工作；两年来还只有个别地区在这一工作上获得了较好的成绩，全国的美术工作者今后应继续为民间年画的改造努力。
    在两年的年画创作中，涌现了不少新的作者，也产生了优秀的作品，这些作品不仅为广大人民所喜爱，而且可以作为提高美术创作水平的示范；为了巩固与扩大年画创作的成果，本部特组织年画评奖委员会，根据目前年画工作的要点，将两年来的年画作品加以评选，并决定应予授奖者的名单，经本部审定后公布如后。
