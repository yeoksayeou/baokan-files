    CPC Mouping County Committee Utilizes Local Product Exchange Opportunities to Organize Propagandists for Current Affairs Propaganda

    Editor: The CPC Shandong Province Mouping County Committee seized the opportunity of the township holding a local product exchange meeting to organize propagandists to conduct current affairs and policy propaganda to the masses. During the six days of propaganda, a total of 160,000 people were educated and gained some understanding of national policies and current situation and tasks. For example, after viewing the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda posters, everyone expressed their intention to continue to increase production and support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Another example is that after the women listened to the propagandists' speeches on the Marriage Law, they realized that the old marriages were unreasonable and the new marriages were free and happy; some women even mobilized other women to come to the propaganda booths to listen to the speeches after listening to the propagandists' speeches.

    The reason why this propaganda was able to achieve greater results is because: First, the propagandists conducted propaganda based on the masses' thoughts, using local real people and real events, and using good and bad comparison illustrations. Second, the preparations were fully made. For example, eight propaganda booths were set up in places where the masses were concentrated, and various propaganda posters were posted inside and outside the booths, attracting many people to come and see. In addition, the county party committee appropriately equipped propaganda talents, fully exerted the ability of each propagandist, and paid attention to exchanging propaganda experience at any time.

    中共牟平县委利用土产交流机会
    组织宣传员进行时事宣传
    编辑同志：中共山东省牟平县委抓紧城厢召开土产交流会的机会，组织宣传员向群众进行了时事政策宣传。在六天的宣传中，共有十六万人受到了教育，他们对国家政策及当前的形势和任务都有了一些了解。如大家看了抗美援朝的宣传画，就表示要继续加劲生产，支援人民志愿军。又如妇女们听了宣传员关于婚姻法的讲话以后，了解到旧的婚姻不合理，新的婚姻自由幸福；有的妇女听了宣传员的讲话以后，还去动员别的妇女到宣传棚来听讲。
    这次宣传所以能够收到较大的效果，是因为：第一，宣传员根据群众思想，用当地的真人真事，用好坏对比的图例进行了宣传。其次是准备工作做得充分。如在群众集中的地方，设立了八个宣传棚，棚内棚外都张贴了各种宣传画，吸引了许多群众来看。此外，县委还恰当地配备了宣传人材，充分地发挥了每个宣传员的能力，并注意了随时交流宣传经验。
