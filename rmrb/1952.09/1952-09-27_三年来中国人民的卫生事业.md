The people's health undertaking in China over the past three years, with the gradual recovery and improvement of the national economy, is advancing with unprecedented strength and speed in Chinese history. The evils brought to the people's health and life by the reactionary ruling class in the past many years are being eliminated, and the people's health life across the country has presented a new look. The incidence and mortality rates are decreasing, and the birth rate is increasing. The achievements of the people's health undertaking have prepared certain conditions for national economic construction and national defense construction.

To eliminate smallpox, we have inoculated a large number of people with cowpox vaccine. In 1949 and 1951, more than 45 percent of the country's population was inoculated with cowpox vaccine, which is equivalent to 29 times the highest inoculation record during the Kuomintang's reactionary rule. It is planned that by the end of this year, we will basically achieve the goal of vaccinating all the people in the country with cowpox once. As a result of a large number of vaccinations, the incidence of smallpox this year has decreased by 90 percent compared to 1950. In the past three years, we have also made great efforts to improve environmental sanitation, protect water sources, remove garbage, strengthen traffic quarantine, and focus on injecting cholera vaccine, so that our country has not found a single case of true cholera for the fourth year. In the prevention and treatment of plague, in the past three years, through mass rat extermination, flea eradication, cleaning campaigns, and appropriate vaccination, this plague, which was once feared, has been effectively controlled and has been eliminated in some areas. Plague is no longer the biggest disease threatening the people on Chinese soil. Due to the increasing improvement of environmental hygiene, the incidence of other diseases such as malaria, kala-azar, and Japanese schistosomiasis has also sharply decreased.

In protecting the health of mothers and infants, 17,835 maternity stations have been organized across the country in the past three years, and more than 127,000 old midwives have been trained and transformed. New delivery methods have been widely promoted, and new childcare methods have begun to be instilled, greatly reducing the mortality rate of infants and mothers. Taking the birth mortality rate of Liulin Village, Pingyuan Province, as an example: in 1949, 8 out of 10 newborns died in the village; in 1950, 4 out of 11 newborns died; in 1951, 3 out of 13 newborns died; and in the first half of this year, all 5 newborns survived healthily. With the improvement of the people's health level, the birth rate across the country has gradually increased. The birth rate in some areas has increased from 30 per thousand before liberation to 45 to 54 per thousand. Our maternal and child health workers will make the greatest efforts to ensure that the lovely children born to every mother are healthy and strong. In this way, our country's population will increase dramatically.

The health of ethnic minority areas has always been the worst, and the mortality rate in individual areas is appalling. However, since the liberation of the whole country, with the dispatch of prevention and treatment teams, the establishment of grassroots health organizations, and the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases, the trend of population decline in ethnic minority areas has begun to stop, and in many areas the population has increased significantly. According to a survey in the first half of 1951 in Chen Barag Banner, Inner Mongolia, the population increased to 146 people. At present, in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, and other ethnic autonomous regions in various provinces, health institutions have been established in counties where ethnic minorities account for more than 50 percent of the population. There are now 265 health centers, 24 public hospitals, and 48 regular mobile medical teams. Free treatment has been basically implemented in those areas. We are now actively trying to train ethnic minority health cadres in various ethnic minority areas to solve the shortage of health personnel.

In terms of industrial and mining health, grassroots health organizations, medical institutions, and safety and health committees have been universally established in industrial and mining areas across the country. The percentage of physicians in Northeast China's industrial and mining areas is larger than in other regions, so the effect of protecting the health of employees is also greater. The percentage of industrial accidents and occupational diseases among employees decreased from 6.4 percent in 1949 to 1.6 percent in the first half of 1951. In addition, a large number of epidemic prevention teams and medical teams were dispatched to cooperate in the great construction projects of harnessing the Huai River, diverting the Yi River, the Jingjiang River flood diversion, and the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, etc., to protect the health of millions of migrant workers, so that the various engineering tasks could be successfully completed.

With the development of various health work, health institutions have also been gradually restored and developed. As of the end of 1951, 91.2 percent of county health centers had been established, and county-level health institutions will all be established by the end of this year. The number of public hospitals across the country has increased by 275.4 percent compared to before liberation, and the number of beds has increased by 300 percent. Health agencies in districts and villages have adopted forms such as public ownership, joint public-private ownership, public assistance by the people, joint clinics, and medical cooperative societies. These health agencies are now developing. In June of this year, the State Council of the Central People's Government announced instructions on the implementation of free medical care and prevention for state staff, so that millions of state staff have received medical care, and this free medical care and prevention system will gradually expand its scope.

In order to meet the needs of national health construction, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has paid attention to cultivating a large number of senior, intermediate, and junior medical and health personnel. The number of medical colleges, specialized courses, secondary medical schools, and training courses across the country increased by 190 percent in 1950 compared to 1949, and increased by another 62 percent in 1951; the number of students increased by 176.5 percent in 1950 compared to 1949, and increased by another 142.9 percent in 1951. The total number of students in senior medical and pharmaceutical colleges in 1951 has exceeded the total number of doctors trained in the past 69 years. The new medical students recruited in 1950 and 1951 alone are equivalent to more than 60 percent of the total number of doctors who graduated in the past 69 years. These new young students are being cultivated under the guidance of new school systems and new educational principles. In the near future, they will play an inestimable role in the construction of the new China's health undertaking.

Our people have also achieved victory in the struggle against the inhuman bacteriological warfare waged by US imperialism against our country. In order to save its tragic defeat on the Korean battlefield, US imperialists used bacteriological weapons against the people of China and Korea, attempting to use bacteriological weapons to suffocate the resistance of the people of China and Korea. However, the facts are completely contrary to what US imperialism妄想. The answer of the Chinese people is to launch a large-scale patriotic health movement with overwhelming momentum, in the front, in the rear, and even across the country. The vast majority of adults and children in many areas participated in this movement, received education in health knowledge, and deepened their hatred of US imperialism. They automatically put forward the requirements of "eight cleanliness" (children, body, room, yard, street, kitchen, toilet, and livestock pens must be clean), "five eliminations" (eliminate flies, mosquitoes, lice, fleas, and bedbugs), and "one capture" (capture rats), and the slogan of "killing a fly is killing an American devil." According to recent incomplete statistics, the people across the country have captured more than 44 million rats, eliminated more than 2 million catties and more than 19 billion flies, mosquitoes, and fleas, cleared more than 15 million tons of garbage, dredged more than 25,900 kilometers and more than 750,000 ditches, and filled in a large number of sewage pits, including the large water pit in Nanguan, Shanhaiguan, which is said to have been dug when the Great Wall was built. In Yangzhou, the garbage left over from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era was cleared. Adults and children invented all kinds of equipment and methods for catching rats, eliminating flies, and eliminating mosquitoes in collective research. Some people caught hundreds of rats, and some people caught more than 100 catties of mosquito larvae. Many tree holes in cities have been filled. Cities and districts and villages with no or few flies have appeared. The vigorous patriotic health movement, from cities to villages, from environmental sanitation to personal hygiene, regardless of men, women, old and young, unified from top to bottom, vigorously and swiftly, not only gave a powerful blow to the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism, but also changed the unhealthy habits of many years before liberation, and diseases have also been greatly reduced as a result. The patriotic health movement is a general review of the people's strength and science, and is the greatest and most amazing development of the achievements of health construction in the past three years. The brutal behavior of US imperialism has once again suffered a shameful defeat in the face of the Chinese people.

The reason why we have been able to achieve these achievements is first of all due to Chairman Mao's wise leadership and his long-term concern for the people's health undertaking. The Chinese people's health workers followed the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, and at the First National Health Conference in 1950, they decided on the three principles of health work: "serving workers, peasants and soldiers, prioritizing prevention, and uniting Chinese and Western medicine," and formulated four decisions: improving and developing grassroots health organizations across the country, adjusting the relationship between public and private interests in the medical and health undertaking, unity, mutual assistance and learning in the medical field, and developing health education and training health workers at all levels. The correctness of these principles and decisions has been proved in the test of practical work, and thus great achievements have been obtained. At the same time, in the specific work of the past three years, it has also been fully confirmed that only by working for the masses and relying on the masses, and carrying out health work under the guidance of correct guidelines, can the people's health undertaking be done well. This patriotic health movement has powerfully illustrated this problem.

What lies before the Chinese people's health workers is the health problem of 475 million people. If their health is guaranteed, the speed of economic and national defense construction will be greatly increased. This is an arduous and glorious burden. In the health construction undertaking of the past three years, all our people's health workers have contributed their strength to the motherland and the people, especially in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea and oppose the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism, they have demonstrated a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and created heroic model deeds. This is the glory of the people's health workers, and it is also the glory of our great motherland. We must carry forward this glory in the future construction of the great motherland, and serve the people even better.

    三年来中国人民的卫生事业
    中央人民政府卫生部部长  李德全
    三年来中国人民的卫生事业，随着国家经济的逐步恢复和好转，正以中国历史上空前的力量和速度向前迈进。过去许多年以来反动统治阶级给人民卫生生活上带来的恶果正在被消除，全国人民的卫生生活已呈现出一个崭新的面貌，发病率与死亡率在减少着，出生率在增加着。人民卫生事业的成就，已为国家经济建设和国防建设准备下一定的条件。
    我们为消灭天花，大量接种了牛痘。一九四九年和一九五一年，全国人口的百分之四十五以上接种了牛痘，这就相当于国民党反动统治时期最高接种纪录的二十九倍。预定今年年底前，我们要使全国人民基本上达到普种一次牛痘的目的。由于大量接种牛痘的结果，今年较一九五○年的天花发病率已减少了百分之九十。三年来又曾以大力改善环境卫生，保护水源，清除垃圾，加强交通检疫，并有重点地注射霍乱疫苗，使我国已经是第四年度未发现一例真性霍乱。在鼠疫的防治上，三年来，经过群众性的捕鼠灭蚤、清洁运动和适当的接种疫苗，使得这一令人有谈虎色变之感的鼠疫，已受到有效的控制，而且在某些地区已被消灭。鼠疫在中国土地上已经不再是威胁人民最大的疾病了。由于环境卫生的日益改善，使其它疾病如疟疾、黑热病、日本住血吸虫病的发病率，也已锐减。
    在保护母亲和婴儿健康的工作上，三年来全国各地已组织了一万七千八百三十五处接生站，训练改造旧接生婆约十二万七千余人，大量推行了新接生法，开始灌输新育儿法，使婴儿、产妇死亡率大大降低。以平原省柳林村的出生死亡率一例来说：该村一九四九年新生婴儿十人死八人，一九五○年生十一人，死四人，一九五一年生十三人死三人，今年上半年生五人都健壮地生存下来。随着人民健康水平的提高，全国的出生率已逐渐增加，有的地区的出生率已由解放前的千分之三十达到千分之四十五到千分之五十四。我们妇幼卫生工作者，将以最大的努力，使每个母亲生下来的可爱的儿女，都活得很健壮。这样，我们国家的人口将会有飞跃的增加。
    少数民族地区的卫生，一向是最差的，个别地区死亡率是骇人听闻的。但是，自全国解放以后，经过派遣防治队、建立卫生基层组织与防治性病的结果，在少数民族地区，人口减少的趋向已开始停止，更有不少的地区人口已有显著的增加，如内蒙陈巴尔虎旗据一九五一年上半年的调查：出生的人口就增到一百四十六人。目前在内蒙、新疆、青海以及其他各省民族自治区，凡少数民族占百分之五十以上人口的县份都建立了卫生机构，现已有卫生院二百六十五所，公立医院二十四所，经常的巡回医防队四十八队，并在那些地区基本上实行了免费治疗。现正在积极设法培养各少数民族地区的民族卫生干部，以解决卫生人员的不足。
    在工矿卫生方面，全国工矿区普遍地建立了卫生基层组织、医疗机构以及安全卫生委员会。东北工矿中的医师百分比较各区为大，因而保障职工健康的效果亦较大。在工业中职工的灾害和职业病，由一九四九年的百分之六·四，降低到一九五一年上半年的百分之一·六。此外，并在治淮、导沂、荆江分洪、修筑成渝铁路等项伟大建设工程中派遣大量防疫队和医疗队配合工作，保障了数百万民工的健康，使各项工程任务能胜利完成。
    随着各项卫生工作的开展，卫生机构也逐步得到恢复和发展。截至一九五一年底止，县卫生院的建立已达百分之九十一·二，到本年底县级卫生机构将全部建立起来。全国公立医院较解放前增加百分之二百七十五·四，病床增加百分之三百。区、村的卫生机关，则采取了公办、公私合办、民办公助、联合诊所、医药合作社等形式，这种卫生机关现正在发展着。今年六月中央人民政府政务院公布了国家工作人员实行公费医疗预防的指示，使数百万国家工作人员得到了医药的照顾，而且这一公费医疗预防制度将逐渐扩大其范围。
    为适应国家卫生建设的需要，中央人民政府卫生部曾注意到大量培养高级的、中级的、初级的医药卫生人员。全国医药院校、专修科、中级医学校与训练班，一九五○年比一九四九年增设了百分之一百九十，一九五一年又增加百分之六十二；学生人数一九五○年比一九四九年增加百分之一百七十六·五，一九五一年又增加百分之一百四十二·九。高级医、药院校一九五一年的在校学生总数已超过了过去六十九年所训练出来的医生总数，仅一九五○年和一九五一年所招收的医科新生就相当过去六十九年毕业医生总数的百分之六十以上。这些新的青年学生，是在新的学制和新的教育原理指导下培养着，不久的将来，他们将为新中国卫生事业的建设发挥不可估计的力量。
    我国人民在反对美帝国主义对我国所进行的灭绝人性的细菌战的斗争中也取得了胜利。美帝国主义者为了挽救它在朝鲜战场上的悲惨失败，对中朝两国人民使用了细菌武器，企图用细菌武器来窒息中朝人民的反抗力量。但是事实与美帝国主义所妄想的完全相反。中国人民的回答就是以排山倒海之势，在前方、在后方以至在全国展开了一个大规模的爱国卫生运动，许多地区绝大部分成年人和儿童都参加了这个运动，受到了卫生常识的教育，加深了对美帝国主义的仇恨。他们自动提出了“八净”（孩子、身体、室内、院子、街道、厨房、厕所、牲畜圈都要干净）、“五灭”（灭蝇、蚊、虱、蚤、臭虫）、“一捕”（捕鼠）的要求，和“打死一个苍蝇就是消灭一个美国鬼子”的口号。据最近的不完全统计，全国人民已捕鼠四千四百多万只，灭蝇、蚊、蚤等共二百多万斤又一百九十多亿只，清除垃圾一千五百万吨以上，疏通沟渠二万五千九百多公里又七十五万多条，并填平了大批污水坑，填平了据传说是修万里长城时挖的山海关南关大水坑。在扬州，清除了太平天国时代所留下的垃圾。成人与儿童在集体研究中发明了各式各样的捕鼠、灭蝇、灭蚊的器具和方法。有的人捕鼠数百只，有的人捞孑孓一百斤以上。许多城市的树洞都堵起来了。出现了没有或很少苍蝇的城市和区、村。轰轰烈烈的爱国卫生运动，从城市到乡村，从环境卫生到个人卫生，不分男女老幼，上下一致，雷厉风行，其结果不只对美帝国主义的细菌战给了有力的打击，并且把解放以前多年来不讲卫生的风气改变了，疾病因之也大大减少。爱国卫生运动是人民力量与科学的总检阅，是三年来卫生建设成绩最大最惊人的发展。美帝国主义的残暴行为，在中国人民的面前又一次遭到可耻的失败。
    我们之所以能取得这些成绩，首先是由于毛主席的英明领导和他长期对人民卫生事业的关心。中国人民卫生工作者遵照了毛主席指示的精神，在一九五○年的第一届全国卫生会议上就决定了“面向工农兵、预防为主、团结中西医”为卫生工作的三大原则，制定了健全和发展全国卫生基层组织、调整医药卫生事业中的公私关系、医药界团结互助学习、发展卫生教育和培养各级卫生工作人员等四项决定。在实际工作的考验中证明了这些原则和决定的正确性，从而获得了伟大的成就。同时，在三年来的具体工作中，也完全证实了：只有为了群众、依靠群众，在正确的方针指导下进行卫生工作，才能把人民卫生事业做好。这次爱国卫生运动已有力地说明了这个问题。
    摆在中国人民卫生工作者面前的是四亿七千五百万人口的健康问题。他们的健康得到保证，则经济和国防建设事业的速度将大大提高。这是一付艰巨而又光荣的重担。在三年来的卫生建设事业上，我全体人民卫生工作者为祖国为人民贡献了力量，特别在抗美援朝与反对美帝国主义的细菌战的斗争中，更表现了高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神，创造了英勇的模范事迹，这是人民卫生工作者的光荣，也是我们伟大祖国的光荣。我们要将这种光荣在今后伟大祖国的建设中更加发扬起来，更好地为人民服务。    （新华社）
