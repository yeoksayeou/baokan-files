    You Grow More Cotton, I Kill More Enemies
    Dear Comrade Qu Yaoli: From the comic books sent by the people of the motherland and the reports of the Volunteer Army's returning delegation, we have become familiar with you and your exemplary deeds. Comrades all say, "More than nine hundred catties of cotton per mu, it's really become a mountain of cotton!" "With such a great motherland, diligent people, and abundant resources, defeating the American devils is no problem!" Indeed, your cotton on the Korean front is no longer just cotton, but has become our strength to kill the enemy. We, the Volunteer Army, love to hear news of the motherland's production and construction, love to see pictures of the motherland's tractors plowing the fields, and even more love to hear the heroic stories of labor models fighting against nature, because this is consistent with our goals. We are fighting bloody battles in Korea precisely for the peaceful construction of the motherland.
    I was originally a farmer, but I received education and training from the Party on the Korean front, and that is how I earned the special merit. Last year, I returned to the country to participate in the National Day ceremony, and was also invited to attend the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. I saw Chairman Mao and also saw many patriotic deeds of the people of the motherland. After returning to Korea, I was thinking day and night about how to make greater contributions to the people of the motherland. Your exemplary deeds have added strength to me, and I must annihilate more enemies.
              A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, Chen San

    你多收棉花，我多杀敌人
    亲爱的曲耀离同志：从祖国人民送来的连环画和志愿军归国代表团的报告中，我们已经熟悉了你和你的模范事迹。同志们都说：“一亩地产九百多斤棉花，真是成了棉花山了！”“我们有这样伟大的祖国，勤劳的人民，丰富的物产，打败美国鬼子不成问题！”的确，你的棉花在朝鲜前线已经不再是棉花，而变成我们的杀敌力量了。我们志愿军最爱听祖国生产建设上的消息，爱看祖国的拖拉机种地的图片，更爱听劳动模范们和自然斗争的英勇故事，因为这和我们奋斗的目标是一致的。我们浴血战斗在朝鲜，正是为了祖国的和平建设。
    我本来也是一个农民，在朝鲜前线受到党的教育和培养，才立了特等功。去年归国参加了国庆节观礼，还被邀列席人民政协第一届全国委员会第三次会议，看到了毛主席，也看到了祖国人民的许多爱国事迹。回到朝鲜后，我日夜在想着如何为祖国人民立下更大的功劳。你的模范事迹又给我增添了力量，我一定要歼灭更多的敌人。
