The advanced experience of the Liu Changfu Group in Promoting Economic Accounting System
Wang Tao, Director of Tianjin Steel Plant

    The Liu Changfu Group is an advanced group in the wire rolling workshop of the Tianjin Steel Plant's wire rod department. In 1951, when the economic accounting system was implemented, with the patient education and specific assistance of the Tianjin Steel Plant's leadership, this group became an excellent model for implementing the group economic accounting system.
    The characteristics of the Liu Changfu Group can be summarized as "five haves" (having a plan, having calculations, having records, having systems, and having technology) and "two combinations" (combining leadership and the masses, combining workers and technicians).
    The group has separate production plans, quality plans, raw material consumption plans, man-hour plans, and maintenance plans. It has also established a set of original records to reflect the group's work (including output, quality, raw material consumption, equipment utilization, and man-hours). These plans were formulated with the participation of all workers with the help of technicians, and their purpose is to improve production in all aspects. After the plans are formulated, the production situation is checked daily and monthly according to the plans, so the workers have learned to calculate the methods of each indicator, and through the original records, they can calculate the direct cost of their daily production and the value of increased production and savings.
    In addition to accurate planning and records, the Liu Changfu Group has also established a series of systems to strengthen technical management, improve labor organization, and strengthen the responsibility system to further consolidate and improve the group economic accounting system. Their group has a technical research association, a life review meeting, a cross-shift handover system, a safety inspection system, and a learning system. At the technical research association, workers often discuss various technical problems in production. In three months, Liu Changfu passed on all his fifteen years of steel rolling experience to the workers; technicians also regularly systematically taught technical operating procedures. In half a year, the group made a total of nineteen major technical improvements, which can create wealth worth 8 billion yuan for the country throughout the year. In terms of learning, reading the newspaper every day has become a habit of the group. The victory news from the Korean front often inspires them to increase their enthusiasm for production. Other systems have also greatly promoted the group's production.
    After the Liu Changfu Group implemented the economic accounting system, the group's outlook was completely renewed.
    First, the workers established the concept of economic accounting. In the past, workers thought: "Workers just work, calculate how much they do, and rush home after get off work." Now, everyone cares about production, and waits for the cost and savings figures to be calculated before going home after work every day. In the past, they would stop and rest after completing the task. Now, the workers consciously increase the hourly output and operating rate of the machine, and strive not to waste a minute. Once, the workers predicted that there would be a power outage, so they continued production without stopping the machine during the handover, and moved the maintenance work to the time of the power outage, and still completed the group's daily production plan.
    Second, everyone knows the numbers. In the past, when workers discussed plans, they completely relied on enthusiasm to set tasks. Now, they know the specific accounting conditions, and start with finding more tricks and putting forward specific methods to comprehensively improve production.
    Third, use your brains and give play to your wisdom. In the past, workers only had a simple view of physical labor. They said: "We are rough guys, how can we study problems!" "If we can solve these technical problems, why do we need technicians!" Now they have found tricks in every production procedure. The workers said: "If you don't find tricks, don't count carefully, and rely solely on brute force, you can't make a good plan or do a good job"; "With the economic accounting system, we can know where the problem is, and everyone can use their brains to solve it." In addition, because everyone consciously abides by operating procedures and safety rules, implements the handover system, and implements the division of labor and responsibility system, there have been no work-related injuries for twelve consecutive months.
    Fourth, production performance has steadily increased. After the Liu Changfu Group implemented the economic accounting system, production performance has steadily increased. From the first quarter of this year to the present, the machine-hour output has gradually increased from 3.65 tons to 4.17 tons; the operating rate has increased from 64 percent to 70 percent; the first-class product rate has increased from 90 percent to 96 percent; and the scrap rate has gradually decreased from 0.4 percent to 0.25 percent. The total value of increased production and savings was originally planned to be 7 billion yuan at the beginning of the year; in July, 24 tricks were found, 39 technologies were improved, and it was revised to 15.7 billion yuan, and it was revised again to 18 billion yuan in early August.
    Judging from the achievements of the Liu Changfu Group, the group economic accounting system is an organized form of socialist labor, and it is the best means to mobilize and organize the working class to complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy. It lays a solid mass foundation for enterprises to implement planned management.
    Liu Changfu's personal leadership method also has an impact on the unity and consolidation of the group. His leadership method is to rely on party members and members of the Communist Youth League to unite and connect with the masses. Every time the group proposes a technical improvement, he always gathers party members and members of the Communist Youth League to discuss it first, and then the party members, members of the Communist Youth League and the masses discuss it. After get off work every day, he reports the situation to the workshop director or the party branch secretary. When he encounters difficulties, he also actively asks the superiors or technicians to help solve them. For example, when Liu Changfu found that the first difficulty in implementing the group economic accounting system was the large number of work-related accidents and low production operating rate. Liu Changfu decided to establish a technical research association and teach the workers his fifteen years of steel rolling experience. At that time, some old technical workers stubbornly resisted. They said, "His skills are about the same as mine, why should I listen to him?" "He hasn't studied as a technician, he's not in the industry." After Liu Changfu's patient explanation, and with the help of the leadership to mobilize and persuade, these conservative ideas were overcome. When improving the gear box device, some old technicians objected, saying, "We've used it for so many years, and we haven't heard that the gear box has any problems." With the efforts and help of the deputy director of the workshop, the problem was also solved.
    In the process of cultivating this group, the workshop leadership, on the one hand, carried out communist education for the workers, and on the other hand, also overcame two erroneous tendencies of the cadres. One is that they do not believe that workers can manage the enterprise, thinking that workers have a low level of education and cannot master the plan and improve technology, so they treat the group's work with a paternalistic attitude. The other is that they do not proceed from reality, and hand over a set of "complete-style forms" and complicated calculations to the workers, which makes the workers daunted. After overcoming these two erroneous tendencies, the leadership found a set of simple and easy-to-understand methods suitable for workers with low cultural levels. From easy to difficult, from simple to complex, from low-level to high-level, the workers learned how to make plans, make records, and other methods. (Attached picture)

    刘长福小组推行经济核算制的先进经验
    国营天津钢厂厂长　王韬
    刘长福小组，是天津钢厂线材部轧钢车间的一个先进小组。一九五一年推行经济核算制时，在天津钢厂领导方面的耐心教育和具体帮助下，这个小组成了实行小组经济核算制的优秀典型。
    刘长福小组的特点，概括起来为“五有”（有计划、有计算、有记录、有制度、有技术）和“两个结合”（领导和群众结合、工人和技术人员结合）。
    小组有单独的产量计划、质量计划、原材料消耗计划、工时计划和检修计划。并建立了足以表现小组工作的一套原始纪录（包括产量、质量、原材料消耗、设备运用和工时）。这些计划，是在技术人员的帮助下，全体工人参加制订出来的，其目的是从各方面改进生产。计划订出后，就根据计划每日每月检查生产情况，因此工人都学会了计算各指标的方法，并通过原始记录，计算自己每天生产的直接成本和增产节约的价值。
    除了精确的计划与记录而外，刘长福小组还建立了加强技术管理、改善劳动组织、加强责任制的一系列制度以进一步巩固和提高小组经济核算制。他们小组有技术研究会、生活检讨会、交叉交接班制度、安全检查制度和学习制度。在技术研究会上，工人们经常讨论生产中各项技术问题，刘长福在三个月内，把十五年的轧钢经验全部传授给工人；技术人员也经常系统地讲授技术操作规程。半年来全组共作了十九件重大的技术改进，全年可为国家创造价值八十亿元的财富。在学习方面，每天读报已成为小组的生活习惯。朝鲜前线的胜利消息，经常鼓舞他们增加生产的热情。其它的各项制度，对小组的生产也都有很大的推动作用。
    刘长福小组实行经济核算制以后，小组面貌为之一新。
    第一、工人树立了经济核算的观念。过去，工人认为：“工人就是干活的，干了多少就算多少，下了班抢着回家。”现在则人人关心生产，每天下班后，都等着核算出成本和节约数字来才回家去。过去，完成任务后就停车休息，现在，工人自觉地提高了机器每小时的产量和作业率，争取不浪费一分钟。有一次，工人预知将要停电，交接班时没有停车就接着生产，把检修工作移到停电的时间去进行，结果仍然完成了小组的当日生产计划。
    第二、人人做到心中有数。过去，工人讨论计划时，完全凭着热情去规定任务，现在则知道具体核算条件，并从多找窍门、提出具体办法着手，全面改进生产。
    第三、开动脑筋，发挥智慧。过去，工人们只有单纯的体力劳动观点。他们说：“我们是大老粗，那能研究问题！”“这些技术问题，我们能解决了，还用人家技术员干么！”现在在各个生产程序上都找出了窍门。工人们说：“不找窍门，不算细账，专凭蛮干，订不好计划，作不好工作”；“有了经济核算制，我们就能知道问题在那里，大家动脑筋去解决”。此外，由于人人自觉地遵守操作规程和安全规则，贯彻交接班制度和实行分工负责制，已经连续十二个月没有发生工伤事故。
    第四、生产成绩平稳上升。刘长福小组在实行经济核算制以后，生产成绩就平稳上升。从今年第一季度到现在，机时产量由三点六五吨逐渐上升到四点一七吨；作业率由百分之六十四上升到百分之七十；一级品由百分之九十上升到百分之九十六；废品率由百分之零点四逐渐降到百分之零点二五。增产节约总值，年初订计划时为七十亿元；在七月份，找到二十四个窍门，改进了三十九件技术，改订为一百五十七亿元，八月初又改为一百八十亿元。
    从刘长福小组的成绩看来，小组经济核算制，是一种有组织的社会主义的劳动形式，是发动与组织工人阶级完成增产节约任务的最好的手段，它给企业实行计划管理奠定了坚实的群众基础。
    刘长福个人的领导方法，对小组的团结和巩固，也是有影响的。他的领导方法，是依靠党员、团员，团结和联系群众。小组每次提出技术改进时，他总是先召集党、团员商量，再由党、团员和群众商量。每日下班后，他都向车间主任或党支部书记汇报情况，遇到困难时，他又主动要求上级或技术人员帮助解决。例如当刘长福发现实行小组经济核算制，首先遇到的困难是小组的工伤事故多，生产作业率低等技术问题。刘长福决定成立技术研究会，把自己十五年的轧钢经验讲授给工人。当时有些老技术工人顽强地抵抗。他们说：“他那两下子同我的差不多，叫我听他讲？”“他没有学过技工，不是行里。”经过了刘长福的耐心解释，以及领导方面帮助动员说服，才克服了这些保守思想。改进牙轮箱装置的时候，有的老技工反对说：“用了这么多年，也没听说牙轮箱会出毛病。”在车间副主任的努力帮助下，也解决了问题。
    车间领导方面在培养这个小组过程中，一方面对工人进行共产主义教育，一方面也克服了干部的两种错误倾向。一种是不相信工人能管理企业，认为工人文化水平低，不能掌握计划和改进技术，于是以包办代替的态度来对待小组工作。另一种是不从实际出发，把一套“完整式样的表格”和复杂的计算，交给工人，使工人望而生畏。克服了这两种错误倾向后，领导方面找出了通俗易行的适合于工人文化低的一套办法。由易到难，由简到繁，由低级到高级，使工人学会了订计划、作记录等方法。（附图片）
