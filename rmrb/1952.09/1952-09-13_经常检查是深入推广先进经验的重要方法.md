    Frequent Inspection is an Important Method for Deepening the Promotion of Advanced Experiences
    Dou Qi
    At the end of last year, after the new method of train inspection was introduced from the Northeast China Railway to the Fengtai Vehicle Depot, the Qu Shiheng group took the lead in the experiment. The leading cadres of the depot had made many mobilization reports in advance, and the Qu Shiheng group had also undergone repeated study and discussion to overcome ideological obstacles. All the workers in the group gladly accepted this glorious task under the encouragement of their superiors.
    At the beginning, the workers felt that the new method was indeed better than the old method of "taking a small hammer and making a quick tour" which emphasized inspection but not repair. However, in the actual work process, they felt that they lacked a set of sequences and steps, which made the work seem chaotic. The four car-under-inspection workers, Han Kechang, Bai Baoyin, Wang Xueqin, and Ma Ruitang, had three different work sequences. The worker Li Qingyuan also said: "It won't work without a sequence. When inspecting the car, I always mutter to myself, wondering if I've seen everything." Therefore, the workers also believed that "promoting the new method in this way is still not guaranteed," and they were "afraid of not learning it well," and many people lost their enthusiasm.
    In response to this situation, the leading cadres, after research, believed that it was mainly due to everyone's unfamiliarity with the new method. Therefore, they mobilized everyone to find the sequence, study in depth, overcome difficulties, and use the spirit of creation to enrich the content of the new method of train inspection. All the workers of the Qu Shiheng group regained their spirits, not only studying carefully during their shifts, but also full of energy after work, researching, discussing, and practicing the sequence. Some workers even continued working in the pouring rain. Through such hard study and practice, they finally found a preliminary sequence and steps. The technicians combined the experience accumulated by each person over time and organized it into a complete set of sequences and steps, which were then implemented among the workers. Sure enough, everyone felt very comfortable, as if a disease had been removed from their hearts. When working again, there was a certain order to where the hammer pointed, where the eyes looked, and how the steps were taken. For example, the car-under-inspection worker starts from the first car hook bracket and takes forty-one steps to the seventh wheel hoop, inspecting two hundred and twenty-six items. Because everyone's work sequence and steps are fixed, the phenomenon of missed inspections and repairs is prevented. Everyone said with confidence: "I guarantee that the cars I have inspected and repaired will never have an accident."
    Because the operation has a certain sequence and steps, everyone is becoming more and more proficient, and the technical inspection time for each car is also becoming shorter and shorter. Before the implementation of the new method, the average technical inspection time for each car was 0.9 minutes. During the 500-kilometer movement with full load and exceeding the axle load, Soviet experts suggested shortening it to 0.5 minutes. Now, as a result of the workers' active struggle against time, it has reached 20 or 19 seconds, while still guaranteeing quality.
    However, after the Qu Shiheng group achieved certain results, individual workers became arrogant and complacent due to constant praise. For example, some people thought: "Our group is well-equipped with manpower, there is no problem," "Our group has almost finished promoting the new method," and some people neglected safety issues due to arrogance. In response to this thinking, the leadership launched a discussion. After mass criticism and self-criticism, the Qu Shiheng group removed this stumbling block on the road to progress.
    Promoting a new job will never be smooth sailing. Leading cadres should inspect it at any time, discover problems, and correct them in time, otherwise, advanced experience cannot be promoted smoothly. The Qu Shiheng group is one of many examples.

    经常检查是深入推广先进经验的重要方法
    窦　圻
    去年年底，列检新作业法从东北中长铁路传到丰台车辆段后，屈士恒小组首先带头试验。该段领导干部事先作了许多次动员报告，屈士恒小组也经过三番五次的学习、讨论，克服了思想障碍，全组工友在上级的鼓舞下欣然接受了这个光荣任务。
    开始，工人们觉得新工作法确是比从前“拿着小锤一溜湾”，重检不重修的老一套办法好多了。但在实际工作过程中，他们感到还缺欠一套顺序、步骤，以致工作起来显得紊乱。车下检车员韩克昌、白宝荫、王学勤、马瑞堂四个人就有三样不同的工作顺序。工人李庆元也说：“没有顺序可不行，看车时心里老嘀咕，不知是不是全看到了。”因此，工人们又认为“这样推行新作业法还是没有确实把握”，“怕学不好”，许多人松了劲。
    领导干部针对这种情况，经过研究，认为主要是由于大家对新作业法不熟练的关系。于是，就发动大家找顺序，深入钻研，克服困难，用创造的精神来充实列检新作业法的内容。屈士恒小组全体工人又重振精神，不但在当班时细心钻研，下班后也劲头十足，研究、讨论、练习顺序。有的工人甚至在倾盆大雨下也不停止。这样苦学苦练，终于初步找出了顺序和脚步。技术员把每个人日积月累起来的经验综合在一起，整理出一套完整的顺序和步骤，再拿到工人中间去实行，果然工人都感到非常顺当，心里像去了一块病似的，再工作时，锤子指那，眼看那，脚步怎样迈都有一定的次序。比如，车下检车员由第一位车钩托板开始，到第七位轮箍共迈四十一步，检查二百二十六项。由于每个人的工作顺序和脚步都固定了，防止了漏检漏修的现象。大家都有信心地说：“保证我经手检修过的车绝不出事故。”
    由于作业有了一定的顺序和脚步，大家干的是愈来愈熟练，每辆车的技术检修时间，也跟着愈来愈缩短。没实行列检新作业法时，平均每辆车的技术检修时间需要零点九分钟，在满载超轴五百公里运动中，苏联专家建议缩短到零点五分钟，现在，经过工人们积极和时间作斗争的结果，已达到了二十秒或十九秒，而且还保证了质量。
    但是，屈士恒小组在得到了一定的成绩之后，个别工人由于不断的得到表扬，产生了骄傲自满的情绪。如有人认为：“咱组人力配备挺齐全，没问题”，“咱组推行列检新作业法已差不多了”，也有人由于自高自大而忽视安全问题。领导方面又针对这种思想，发动了讨论。经过群众的批评和自我批评以后，屈士恒小组才铲除了这个前进路上的拌脚石。
    推行一件新的工作，总不会是一帆风顺的。领导干部要随时加以检查，发现问题，及时纠正，否则，是不能把先进经验顺利地推广下去的。屈士恒小组就是许多例子中的一个。
