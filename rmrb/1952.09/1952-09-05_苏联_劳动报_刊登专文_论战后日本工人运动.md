Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 3rd: The "Labor News" published an article by Markov entitled "The Japanese Working Class Struggles for the Freedom and Independence of Their Motherland," commemorating the seventh anniversary of the victory over Japanese imperialism.

Markov wrote: One of the main results of the defeat of Japanese imperialism was the creation of conditions for the development of democratic forces and the labor movement in Japan. In the seven years since the war, this movement has developed on an unprecedented scale in Japan.

Markov recounted that before the war, the Japanese working class was poorly organized, with less than one-tenth of workers participating in trade unions. After the defeat of Japanese imperialism, the labor movement experienced vigorous development. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the working class launched a fierce struggle to demand improved living conditions and the enactment of progressive labor laws. At the same time, it also led all domestic democratic forces to struggle to fulfill the Potsdam Proclamation, which stipulated the eradication of Japanese militarism and the democratic construction of Japan.

The actions of the working class, the rapid development of trade unions, and the increased political consciousness of trade union members greatly alarmed the American occupiers and their Japanese puppets. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries tried every possible means to steer the trade union movement onto the track of social reformism and class cooperation.

Markov described the development of the Japanese trade union movement after the war. He pointed out that as the organization and unity of the working class strengthened, the scale of strikes grew larger and larger.

Between 1946 and 1949, a cumulative total of 40 million people participated in several thousand organized labor actions. Later, an average of more than one million people participated in strikes each month. In April and June of this year, workers organized four general strikes to protest against fascist laws. Several million people participated in these strikes. The workers knew that the struggle to meet daily needs was inseparable from the struggle to liberate the motherland from colonial enslavement and the struggle against the re-militarization and fascization of Japan.

Contrary to the expectations of the occupiers and the traitorous trade union leadership groups, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), which has three million organized workers, did not become a tool of strikebreakers. Under the urging of grassroots organizations, the General Council led workers in strike struggles to launch a broad protest movement against the San Francisco Peace Treaty and reactionary laws.

Markov emphasized the importance of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions (Sanbetsu) and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan taking united action.

Markov said: The action program put forward by the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions calls for struggle against low wages, striving for equal pay for equal work, opposing reactionary laws, striving for freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and organization of strikes and demonstrations, striving for the unity of Japanese trade unions and joining the World Federation of Trade Unions. This program calls for the unrestricted development of peaceful industries, for Japan's economic independence, and for the abolition of the ban on trade with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. The All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions opposes rearmament, advocates the abolition of the occupation system, the abolition of separate treaties and military treaties binding Japan, advocates the conclusion of a comprehensive democratic treaty, and advocates stopping the Korean War.

It can be seen that this program not only meets the hopes of the working class, but also the vital interests of Japanese peasants, intellectuals, and national bourgeoisie who are suffering under the occupation system.

Markov pointed out that the growing strength of the Japanese working class and its alliance with the peasants who are actively participating in the struggle against the occupiers, are the solid foundation of the national liberation democratic united front that is now being formed.

    苏联“劳动报”刊登专文
    论战后日本工人运动
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“劳动报”刊载了马可夫所作的题为“日本工人阶级为争取祖国的自由与独立而斗争”的论文，纪念对日本帝国主义战争胜利七周年。
    马可夫写道：日本帝国主义失败的主要结果之一是日本民主力量与劳工运动的发展有了条件。在战后七年里，这个运动在日本有了空前规模的发展。
    马可夫追述道：在战前，日本工人阶级组织得很差，工人参加工会的不到十分之一。在日本帝国主义失败以后，劳工运动有了蓬勃的发展。在日本共产党领导下，工人阶级展开猛烈的斗争，要求改善生活条件和颁布进步的劳工法。同时它还领导国内一切民主力量为履行规定肃清日本军国主义和让日本进行民主建设的波茨坦公告而斗争。
    工人阶级的行动、工会的迅速发展以及工会会员政治觉悟的提高，使美国占领者及其日本傀儡感到非常恐慌。美日反动派千方百计地想把工会运动引到社会改良主义和阶级合作的轨道上去。
    马可夫叙述了战后日本工会运动发展的情况。他指出：随着工人阶级的组织和团结的加强，罢工的规模愈来愈大。
    在一九四六年至一九四九年期间累计，有四千万人参加了好几千次有组织的工人活动。后来每月平均有一百多万人参加罢工。今年四月和六月，工人组织了四次总罢工，抗议法西斯法律。参加这几次罢工的有好几百万人。工人们知道，为了满足日常需要而进行的斗争，和使祖国从殖民奴役中得到解放的斗争以及反对日本重新军国主义化和法西斯化的斗争是分不开的。
    和占领者与卖国的工会领导集团的期望相反，拥有三百万有组织的工人的日本工会总评议会并没有成为破坏罢工的工贼的工具。在基层组织的督促下，总评议会领导工人进行罢工斗争，借以发动广泛的抗议运动，反对旧金山和约和反动的法律。
    马可夫强调指出全日本产业别工会会议和日本工会总评议会这两大工会联合组织采取一致行动的重要性。
    马可夫说：全日本产业别工会会议所提出的行动纲领，要求进行斗争以反对低微工资，争取给予同等工作的人以同等工资，反对反动的法律，争取言论、出版、集会及组织罢工与示威的自由，争取日本工会的团结及加入世界工会联合会。这个纲领要求无限制地发展和平工业，要求日本经济独立，并废除关于不准与中华人民共和国和苏联进行贸易的禁令。全日本产业别工会会议反对重新武装，主张废除占领制度，废止单独和约和束缚日本的军事条约，主张缔结全面的民主和约，主张停止朝鲜战争。
    由此可见，这个纲领不仅符合工人阶级所怀的希望，而且也符合在占领制度下遭受痛苦的日本农民、知识分子和民族资产阶级的切身利益。
    马可夫指出：日本工人阶级的力量的日益壮大，以及它与积极参加反对占领者的斗争的农民的联盟，是现在正在形成的民族解放民主统一战线的稳固基础。
