Explanation of How to Sing

This song expresses the Chinese working people's victorious confidence and optimistic spirit in building a great motherland. The melody is full of enthusiastic, joyful, and vigorous emotions.

Sing with fullness and strength. The second and fourth measures should be sung lively and jumpily, and each note can be sung with a semi-staccato. The two sentences from the fifth to eighth measures and the ninth to twelfth measures should be sung smoothly. When entering the thirteenth measure, there should be momentum and the rhythm should be clear; then end the first part of the song comfortably. The first two sentences of the chorus should be calm and firm; only at 'We must race against time' should the accumulated power be unleashed; this sentence is the central theme of the song and must be highlighted. After that, sing to the end with a loud voice full of victorious confidence.

All three verses use the same melody, but the mood can be developed according to the specific content of the lyrics when singing. (Wū Xīlíng) (Attached song)

    我们要和时间赛跑
    唱　法　说　明
    这首歌表现了我国劳动人民建设伟大祖国的胜利信心和乐观情绪，曲调充满热烈、愉快和朝气蓬勃的感情。
    唱时要饱满有力。第二、四小节要唱得活泼、跳跃，每个音可用半顿音唱法。第五至第八小节及第九至第十二小节两句要唱得连贯。进入第十三小节时，要有气势并要唱得节奏鲜明；然后舒坦地结束歌曲的前一部分。副歌开始两句，要沉着坚定；至‘我们要和时间赛跑’处，才把积蓄的力量一起迸发出来；这一句是本曲的中心题旨，须使之突显。此后就满怀着胜利信心，以响亮的声音唱至结束。
    三段歌词都用同一曲调，但唱时情绪可根据歌词的具体内容加以发挥。（邬析零）（附歌曲）
