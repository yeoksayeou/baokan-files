To the respected Chairman Mao:

We are 121 rural blacksmiths, carpenters, and foundry workers from 17 counties and cities in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi. We are gathered in the special district to learn the technology of repairing and maintaining new-style agricultural implements. The People's Government provides us with food, travel expenses, and warmly welcomes us. It has also sent technical cadres from the special district's farms and technical workers from the Huafeng Iron Factory to patiently help us, enabling us to learn the technology in a very short time. Recalling the old society, we apprenticed for three years, "visiting masters and friends," and endured hardship but still could not learn the technology. The contrast between these facts before and after is a living education, which makes us further realize that only under your leadership are we working people valued and able to exert our strength.

We know that the People's Government cultivates us so enthusiastically and painstakingly in order to allow us to better serve the people. After listening to the reports from the leaders, we know that our special district has already made great achievements in promoting new agricultural implements. This year alone, farmers throughout the special district have purchased more than 6,000 new-style walking plows and approximately 2,800 new-style waterwheels; however, if the new-style agricultural implements are damaged or lose parts, the farmer brothers and sisters do not know how to repair or maintain them, which affects the development of the patriotic production increase campaign. In order to solve this problem, the People's Government has entrusted us with the task of repairing and maintaining new-style agricultural implements for the farmer brothers.

In order to complete this glorious task, we have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in our studies. In addition to listening to lectures, participating in discussions, and engaging in practical training, many comrades automatically immerse themselves in diligent study during their rest time. In this way, in seven days, we have initially learned the techniques of assembling, disassembling, using, repairing, and maintaining new-style walking plows and waterwheels; the parts we made during the practice were all usable.

We are determined not to disappoint you and the hopes that the people place in us. We guarantee to you that we will establish the idea of serving the people and serving production, vigorously publicize the benefits of new-style agricultural implements to our farmer brothers, and impart technology to rural blacksmiths and carpenters, so that there will no longer be a phenomenon in the entire district of new-style agricultural implements being broken and no one to repair them.

    保证为农民做好新农具修配工作
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是山西长治专区十七个县市的一百二十一个农村铁匠、木匠和翻沙工人，这次集中到专区学习修配新式农具的技术。人民政府供给我们伙食、旅费，热情地招待我们，并且派了专区农场的技术干部和华丰铁工厂的技术工人耐心地帮助我们，使我们在很短的时间内就学会了技术。回想在旧社会，我们学徒三年，“拜师访友”，吃尽苦头还是学不到技术。这前后事实的对比就是一个活的教育，它使我们进一步认识到：只有在您的领导下，我们劳动人民才被人重视，才能发挥自己的力量。
    我们知道，人民政府这样热情苦心地培养我们，是为了让我们更好地为人民工作。听了首长的报告，知道现在我们专区推广新农具已经有了很大成绩。仅在今年全专区农民就购买新式步犁六千多部，新式水车约二千八百部；但是新式农具损坏或丢了零件，农民兄弟不会修配，这就影响了爱国丰产运动的开展。为了解决这个问题，人民政府就把为农民弟兄修配新式农具的任务交给了我们。
    为了完成这个光荣的任务，我们在学习中发挥了高度的积极性。除了听讲、讨论和实习外，许多同志自动在休息时间苦心钻研。这样，在七天的时间内，我们初步学会了新式步犁和水车的装卸、使用及修配技术；实习时制出的零件都能合用。
    我们决心不辜负您和人民对我们的希望，我们向您保证：一定树立为人民服务、为生产服务的思想，大力向农民弟兄宣传新式农具的好处，向农村铁匠、木匠工人传授技术，使全区不再有新式农具坏了没人修理的现象。
