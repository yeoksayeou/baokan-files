Issue No. 15 of "China Youth" of this year has now been published. This issue contains several articles on industrial construction and science and technology. Li Chao's article, "Several Problems Concerning the Shift of the Focus of Leadership of the Communist Youth League of North China to Industrial Construction," pointed out that in the past three years, the Youth League committees of various provinces in North China have relaxed their leadership over the work of the League in factories and mines, and have even more neglected the cultivation and promotion of outstanding young people. In the future, the leadership of the League and the work of the League in factories and mines must be fully adapted to the needs of production and construction, and new problems in this shift of the focus of leadership must be solved. Yang Bo's article, "We Should Learn Science and Technology Well," explained the importance of learning science and technology at present, and pointed out the correct learning attitude, direction, and method. The article "My Understanding of Learning from the Advanced Experience of the Soviet Union" explained the superiority of Soviet experience and the importance of learning from Soviet experience with concrete examples, and explained that learning from Soviet experience must overcome the influence of capitalist ideology. In addition, there are two articles, one analyzing how Huang Runping created a new warehouse management method through ideological struggle, and the other introducing Zhou Kangmin, a model Party member working in the economic sector.
