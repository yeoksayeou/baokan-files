    Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: TASS Moscow, September 21st: The "Izvestia" foreign affairs commentary column published a commentary by Vronsky analyzing foreign newspapers' reviews of the achievements of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China."

    Vronsky wrote: The report of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team and the statements of world-renowned figures such as Wen Youzhang, Faji, and Reverend Johnson have provided a wealth of irrefutable evidence of the use of bacteriological weapons by the American imperialists.

    The International Scientific Commission has fully confirmed the earlier condemnations of the American military. The International Scientific Commission is composed of world-renowned scientists: Andreen of Sweden, Madell of France, Joseph Needham of England, and Olivo of Italy. They conducted an objective and scientific investigation based on first-hand materials. The competence and objectivity of this commission are beyond doubt. It is no accident that the U.S. State Department is very troubled by the publication of facts sufficient to prove the crime of using bacteriological weapons by American imperialists and the conclusions of the International Scientific Commission.

    Vronsky pointed out that because American and British reactionary newspapers cannot refute the facts listed in the report, they are now threatening the members of the International Scientific Commission. However, threats and blackmail cannot enable American and British imperialists to conceal from world opinion the facts of their bacteriological warfare against the civilians of Korea and China. The whole world knows these heinous crimes. The International Scientific Commission has once again confirmed these crimes. No matter what tricks the American and British imperialists use, they cannot escape the responsibility they bear for this serious crime against humanity.

    Xinhua News Agency, September 24th: Rangoon Dispatch: The Burmese "People's Daily" of Mandalay recently commented on the report of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," saying: The American use of bacteriological bombs in Korea has become even more conclusive, because the report is the conclusion reached by scientists including those from Britain, France, and Italy after on-the-spot investigation and research.

    The commentary said: Reverend Johnson of England, as well as reporters, legal workers, and writers from various countries, have visited China for on-the-spot investigations and confirmed that the United States used bacteriological bombs. Wu Zhuming, the Burmese representative attending the Moscow International Economic Conference, also heard recordings of confessions from American air force prisoners of war when he was in China. However, the United States has consistently denied it and proposed that the International Committee of the Red Cross go to Korea and China for investigation. The commentary pointed out that this International Committee of the Red Cross is a tool of the United States, which cannot reflect the objective situation and is responsible for reconnaissance tasks. Therefore, the Korean and Chinese sides refused it to go for investigation.

    The "People's Daily" commented on the United States' evasive attitude, saying: The attitude of the United States is not surprising, because murderers always deny their guilt before the judge, no matter how conclusive the evidence is, this has become a common practice; but today such crimes can no longer be denied.

    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 24th: The Polish "People's Tribune," the Romanian "Spark," and the Hungarian "Free People's Daily" have all published the report of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts of Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" in installments.

### 苏联“消息报”和缅甸“人民报”  拥护国际科学委员会对美国罪行的谴责

    苏联“消息报”和缅甸“人民报”
    拥护国际科学委员会对美国罪行的谴责
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：“消息报”外交评论栏刊载了佛隆斯基的一篇评论，分析外国报纸对于“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的工作成绩的评论。
    佛隆斯基写道：国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的报告以及全世界知名之士文幼章、法奇、约翰逊教长等的声明，已提供了大量关于美帝国主义者使用细菌武器的无可辩驳的证据。
    国际科学委员会已完全证实了早些时所提出的对于美国军方的谴责。国际科学委员会是由世界知名的科学家：瑞典的安德琳、法国的马戴尔、英国的李约瑟、意大利的欧利佛等组成的。他们根据第一手的材料，进行了客观而科学的调查。这个委员会的能力和客观性是无可怀疑的。美国国务院对于足以证明美帝国主义者犯有使用细菌武器罪行的事实和国际科学委员会结论的公布，感到大伤脑筋，这不是没有原因的。
    佛隆斯基指出：美英反动报纸由于不能驳倒报告书中所列举的事实，现在正对国际科学委员会的委员进行威胁。但是，威胁和讹诈的办法，并不能使美英帝国主义者在世界舆论面前掩盖他们对朝中平民进行细菌战的事实。全世界都知道这些滔天罪行。国际科学委员会又一次证实了这些罪行。不管美英帝国主义者使用什么诡计，他们不能逃避他们对这种违反人道的严重罪行应负的责任。
    【新华社二十四日讯】仰光消息：缅甸曼德勒“人民报”最近评论“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的报告书说：美国在朝鲜使用细菌弹，已经更加确凿无疑了，因为报告书是包括英、法、意等国的科学工作者经过实地考察研究后所得的结论。
    评论说：英国约翰逊教长以及各国的记者、法律工作者、作家都曾到中国作过实地的调查，并证实美国使用过细菌弹。出席莫斯科国际经济会议的缅甸代表吴助敏到中国时也听过美国空军俘虏的供词录音。但是美国却一味否认，并提出要红十字国际委员会到朝鲜和中国去调查。评论指出，这个红十字国际委员会是美国的御用组织，它既不能反映客观情况，而且负有侦察军情的任务，因此朝鲜和中国方面拒绝它前往调查。
    “人民报”评论美国的狡赖态度说：美国所持态度不足为奇，因为杀人罪犯不管证据如何确凿，总是要在法官面前矢口抵赖的，这已成为惯例；但是今天这种罪行再也不能抵赖了。
    【新华社布拉格二十四日电】波兰的“人民论坛报”，罗马尼亚的“火花报”和匈牙利的“自由人民报”都分期刊载了“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”报告书。
