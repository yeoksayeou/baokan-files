Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 6th: The Greek battalion, which came from the distant Balkan Peninsula to participate in the American war of aggression in Korea as an accomplice force, has suffered continuous casualties in its attempted incursions into the area west of Tieyuan.

On the night of August 6th, at around 12:00 AM, the Greek battalion, with two platoons of soldiers, attempted to attack a position of our army north of Yuxian. They were ambushed by a squad of our army on the way, suffering more than twenty casualties. At around 1:00 AM the same night and at dawn the next day, the Greek battalion launched two more attacks on the same position with a company of soldiers, but were heroically repelled by our army. The battalion suffered another thirty-seven casualties in these nighttime battles. In the one month from July 10th to August 10th alone, the Greek battalion suffered more than one hundred casualties.

According to an August 30th Associated Press report from the United Nations headquarters in New York, the Greek battalion has lost three hundred and forty-four men in the war of aggression against Korea. Although this is a greatly reduced figure, one can imagine the heavy casualties suffered by this small accomplice army.

There are many accomplice forces like the Greek battalion on the Korean battlefield. They are only a symbolic force for the American imperialist war of aggression carried out under the banner of the United Nations. However, the heavy casualties they have suffered in the war of aggression against Korea represent a great loss to their own countries.

    美军帮凶希腊营伤亡惨重
    【新华社朝鲜前线六日电】从遥远的巴尔干半岛来到朝鲜参加美国侵略战争的帮凶军希腊营，在向铁原以西地区的窜犯中不断地遭到伤亡。
    八月六日夜间十二点多钟，希腊营以两个排兵力前来袭击榆岘以北我军的一处阵地时，中途遭到我军一个班的伏击，死伤二十多名。同夜一点多钟和第二天拂晓，希腊营又以一个连的兵力向该处进行两次袭击，都被我军英勇击退。该营在这夜战斗中又伤亡了三十七名。仅在七月十日到八月十日的一个月中，希腊营已死伤了一百多名。
    据八月三十日美联社自纽约联合国总部报道的消息供称：希腊营在侵朝战争中已损失了三百四十四名。虽然这是一个大打折扣的数字，但人们可以由此想像到这支小小的帮凶军遭到的伤亡是够惨重的了。
    在朝鲜战场上有好些类似希腊营这样的帮凶军，它们对于美帝国主义在联合国旗帜下进行的侵略战争来说，只不过是一种象征性的力量；但是就它们在侵朝战争中所受到的惨重伤亡对其本国来说，则是一种很大的损失。
