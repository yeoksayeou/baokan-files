    Cultural Great Advance
    Peng Bin, Sun Hanchun (Artist)
    19. On the day of graduation, everyone wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. The letter read: "Dear Chairman Mao: Today we are writing to you, not for anything else, but to thank you for leading us in the cultural great leap forward. This time in the experimental class, the teachers taught with new methods, and we all learned more than two thousand characters. This method is very good and suits the tastes of our workers, peasants, and soldiers. When we return to our company, we will continue to study hard and build a strong national defense army to repay your concern."
    20. Zhang Laifu was speaking when the camp's communication soldier delivered a notice. The instructor read the notice and said: "The higher authorities have decided to promote the quick literacy method throughout the army to eliminate illiteracy, improve culture, and lay the foundation for building a modern national defense army." The soldiers mustered all their strength and shouted "Good!" They lifted Zhang Laifu high and shouted: Promote the quick literacy method! Eliminate illiteracy in the army and improve the cultural level of the entire army! (The End)

    文化大进军
    彭彬　孙翰春　作
    十九、结业的那天，大家给毛主席写了一封信，信上写的是：“亲爱的毛主席：今天给你写信，不为别的事情，感谢您领导我们文化大翻身。这回到实验班，教员用新法子教，我们都认了两千多字。这个办法很好，很对咱们工农兵的口味。我们回到连里，还要努力学习，建设强大的国防军来回答您的关心。”
    二十、张来福讲到这里，正好营里通讯员送来通知，指导员看了通知说：“上级决定全军推广速成识字法，消除文盲，提高文化，为建设现代化国防军打下基础。”战士们听了使足了力气，喊了一声“好”！抬起了张来福高呼：推广速成识字法！消除部队文盲，提高全军文化水平。（完）
