    East China Regional Financial and Economic Departments Staff Representative Joint Conference Concludes
    Calls on 400,000 Staff in East China Financial and Economic Departments to Launch Patriotic Labor Competition
    The East China Regional State-Owned Trade, Finance, Transportation, Taxation, and Cooperative Staff Representative Joint Conference, convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions East China Office, concluded on September 1st after eight days. At this conference, representatives formulated labor competition targets for the five major departments and signed a labor competition liaison contract between the five major departments. The conference called on 400,000 staff in the five major financial and economic departments of East China to launch a comprehensive and sustained patriotic labor competition movement to further develop the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.
    Based on the four basic links pointed out by Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau, in his report to the conference, dozens of large and small meetings were held, organized by region and department, to resolve the issue of improving working relationships. The heads of the five major financial and economic departments at the East China level made work reports at the plenary meeting on the second day of the conference, put forward the work tasks of their respective departments for the second half of the year in the overall task of developing urban-rural material exchange, and focused on reviewing the departmentalism existing in their respective departments, as well as the problems existing in their working relationships with other departments, and put forward suggestions for improvement in the future. The profound self-criticism of the heads of each department played a great educational role for all the representatives. The representatives were very moved after listening to the reports and realized the mistakes of only focusing on completing the tasks of their own departments, not seeing the difficulties of other departments, and not paying attention to close cooperation with each other. Therefore, in the small meetings divided by region and department, everyone launched self-criticism, deeply examined the obstacles to the development of urban-rural material exchange work caused by the lack of consistency in guiding principles and steps in the past work of each department. After the review, the representatives focused on discussing how the various departments should cooperate closely in the future, and signed ten labor competition liaison contracts between the five major departments at the conference to mutually supervise and ensure improved relations. For example, between the trade and cooperative departments, in the past, many cadres had an unclear understanding of each other's nature and tasks. Trade cadres had feelings of jealousy or fear towards the rapid development of the cooperative economy, and cooperative cadres also had the idea of blindly pursuing profits and competing with state-owned companies for goods, resulting in frequent inconsistencies in planning and pace. In the agency purchase relationship, disputes often occurred in terms of price, specifications, and other aspects. This time, the labor competition liaison contract between the Trade Department of the East China Military and Political Committee and the East China Cooperative General Office mutually guaranteed to actively consult with each other when preparing business plans to achieve unified planning and consistent steps. In the agency purchase business, the trade department guaranteed that the purchase of important economic crops would rely on cooperatives, and generally strive to make the entrusted agency purchase account for 50% to 70% of the total purchase volume, except as stipulated by the central government, and guaranteed to allocate funds according to the plan and implement the principle of superior quality and superior price; the cooperatives guaranteed to give priority to completing the state-entrusted purchase tasks of important economic crops, guaranteed that special funds would be used for special purposes, implement the principle of superior quality and superior price, and guarantee the quality and specifications of the goods. Both parties made mutual cooperation guarantees in the promotion of products and pricing, and stipulated that "family meetings" should be held regularly to negotiate and solve problems on the spot. Other relationships, such as the relationship between banks and cooperatives on the issue of promoting savings and trust deposit business in rural areas, were clearly divided in the liaison contract between the two parties. In the several contracts between the various departments and the transportation departments, practical guarantees were made regarding advance delivery of transportation plans, freight rates, and loss rates. Through the liaison contract, the various departments and the tax bureau further ensured the timely deposit of state tax revenue and the simplification of tax procedures.
    At this conference, the departments summarized the implementation of the policy of uniting and leading private businesses in the summer urban-rural material exchange work. In this year's summer urban-rural material exchange work, the five major financial and economic departments in East China paid attention to better uniting and leading private businesses to actively participate in material exchange, so the market in the entire region quickly recovered and became active. However, in some areas and among some cadres, there were still ideas and practices of "rather be 'left' than right" and "the public takes it all." In the labor competition indicators passed by this conference, uniting and leading private businesses and giving play to their positive role in legitimate business were included as part of the competition indicators.
    According to the estimates of this conference, due to the growth of industrial and agricultural products and the purchasing power of urban and rural people, the total commodity turnover in East China will increase by at least one time in the second half of this year compared with the first half of the year, and will increase by more than 20% compared with the second half of last year. In order to better develop industrial and agricultural production and meet the needs of people's consumption, and to correctly implement policies, the departments put forward labor competition indicators for the second half of this year at the conference. The conference also focused on discussing strengthening trade union work, improving workers' working conditions and welfare measures, and the specific methods for carrying out labor competitions. After discussion, all departments have decided to transfer a group of responsible cadres to work full-time on trade union work, establish and strengthen grassroots trade unions, and established the preparatory committee and working committee of the leadership bodies of the three major industrial trade unions of shop assistants, transportation, and finance and finance at the East China level, and determined the future work guidelines of the three industrial trade unions.
    At the end of the meeting, Fang Yi, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the East China Military and Political Committee, made a summary on behalf of the Presidium. He called on all representatives to strive for the leadership and help of local organizations of the CPC and the People's Government after returning, quickly mobilize the 400,000 staff of the five major departments in the entire region, formulate more specific indicators and liaison contracts adapted to various regions and departments, welcome the upcoming autumn harvest season, effectively launch labor competitions, and strive to achieve the competition indicators and liaison contracts passed by this conference.

    华东区财经部门职工代表联席会议闭幕
    号召华东财经部门四十万职工开展爱国主义劳动竞赛
    中华全国总工会华东办事处召开的华东区国营贸易、金融、交通、税务四部门及合作社职工代表联席会议，历时八天，已于九月一日闭幕。在这次会议上，代表们分别订出了五大部门劳动竞赛的指标，并签订了五大部门间劳动竞赛联系合同。会议号召华东区五大财政经济部门四十万职工，为进一步发展城乡物资交流，迅速地展开一个全面的、持久的爱国主义劳动竞赛运动。
    这次会议根据中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林在向大会所作的报告中指出的四个基本环节，分别以地区及部门为单位，召开了数十个大小会议，解决如何改进工作关系的问题。华东一级五大财政经济部门的首长在会议第二天全体会议上分别作了工作报告，提出了在开展城乡物资交流总任务中各该部门下半年度的工作任务，并着重地检讨了各该部门所存在的本位主义思想以及和其他部门的工作关系上存在的问题，并提出了今后改进的意见。各部门首长深刻的自我批评，对全体代表起了很大的教育作用，与会代表听了报告后都很感动，认识了过去只顾完成本部门任务，看不见其他部门的困难与不注意互相间密切合作的错误。因此，在分地区及分部门的小会上大家都展开了自我批评，深刻地检查了各部门在过去的工作中，因方针和步调不够一致所形成的对开展城乡物资交流工作的障碍。经过检讨后，与会代表又着重讨论了今后各部门如何密切配合的问题，并在会议上五大部门间签订了十个劳动竞赛联系合同，互相督促保证改进关系。譬如，贸易与合作社部门之间，过去由于许多干部对彼此的性质与任务认识不明确，贸易干部中对合作社经济的迅速发展产生嫉妒或畏惧的情绪，合作社干部中也有盲目追求利润、与国营公司竞购物资的思想，以致常有计划不统一步调不一致的现象：在代购关系中，价格、规格等方面也经常发生纠纷。这次华东军政委员会贸易部与华东合作总社的劳动竞赛联系合同，彼此保证在编制经营计划时主动与对方密切协商，达到计划统一、步调一致。在代购业务中，贸易部门保证重要经济作物的收购依靠合作社，除中央规定者外，一般争取做到委托代购占总收购量的百分之五十到七十，并保证按计划拨付资金、贯彻优级优价方针；合作社保证重要经济作物尽先完成国家委托收购的任务，保证专款专用、贯彻优级优价方针及保证货品的品质规格。双方在推销产品及物价工作等方面都作了互相合作的保证，并规定经常举行“家庭会议”，有事就地协商解决。其他如银行与合作社关于在农村中推行储蓄与信托存实业务问题的关系，双方在联系合同中都作了明确的分工。各部门与交通运输部门的几个合同中，对预送运输计划及运价、损耗率等方面都作了切实的保证。各部门与税务局通过联系合同，进一步保证了国家税收的及时入库和税收手续上的简化。
    这次会议上，各部门总结了在夏季城乡物资交流工作中关于团结与领导私商政策的执行情况。今年夏季城乡物资交流工作中，华东区五大财政经济部门都注意更好地团结与领导私商积极参加物资交流，因而全区市场迅速恢复活跃。但在部分地区及一部分干部中还存在着“宁‘左’勿右”和“公家包下来”的思想和做法。这次会议所通过的各部门劳动竞赛指标中，都将团结与领导私商、发挥他们正当经营的积极性，作为竞赛指标的内容之一。
    据这次会议估计，由于工农业产品与城乡人民购买力的增长，今年下半年华东全区商品流转总额将至少较上半年增加一倍，比去年下半年将增加二成以上。为了更好地发展工农业生产与满足人民消费的需要，并正确执行政策，会上各部门都提出了今年下半年劳动竞赛的指标。会议又着重讨论了加强工会工作、改善职工的劳动条件与福利措施及开展劳动竞赛的具体办法。经过讨论，各部门都已决定抽调一批负责的干部专职做工会工作，建立与加强基层工会，并成立了华东区一级店员、交通运输、财政金融三大产业工会领导机构的筹备委员会和工作委员会，并确定了三个产业工会今后的工作方针。
    会议最后由华东军政委员会财政经济委员会副主任方毅代表主席团作了总结。他号召全体代表回去后应争取中共各地方组织与人民政府的领导与帮助，迅速地把全区五大部门四十万职工动员起来，订出适应各地各部门的更具体的指标和联系合同，迎接即将到来的秋收旺季，有效地展开劳动竞赛，为实现这次大会通过的竞赛指标和联系合同而奋斗。（新华社）
