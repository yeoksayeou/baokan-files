The Northwest Region is gradually establishing a sandbreak forest along the Great Wall, stretching approximately three thousand li. Currently, the sandbreak forest extends from Yulin in the northernmost part of Shaanxi to Jiuquan in Gansu, covering over 129,000 mu. Within a few years, it will gradually connect, forming a green "Great Wall" to block the intrusion of sandstorms and protect millions of mu of farmland. In the Northwest Region, from Dengkou County in Ningxia Province to Jiuquan County in Gansu Province, there is a wind and sand season lasting up to seven months each year, while the annual rainfall is less than 50 millimeters. Before the founding of New China, due to sandstorm erosion, Yulin City in northern Shaanxi Province was forced to move south three times. Three hundred li of the Yellow River south of Dengkou were submerged by barren sand, and many villages and farmlands were also buried.

After the birth of New China, the People's Government began to pay attention to the great construction of sandbreak forests. In 1950, the Agricultural and Forestry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee established 17 sandbreak forest construction stations and other institutions along the sandbreak line, and began surveying and designing. When the weather warmed up in the spring of 1951, about 500,000 farmers along the sandbreak line, under the leadership of the People's Government, began to fight against the desert and build forests. Last year, a total of more than 40,000 mu of forest were planted. This year, the afforestation movement has become more widespread and in-depth. In Minqin County, a county with a population of 210,000 on the sandbreak line, 130,000 people participated in the afforestation movement. This spring, 1,600 men and women in Dengkou County, Ningxia Province, planted 3,700 mu of forest with a survival rate as high as 90 percent. The "March 8th Forest" planted by women in Zhongwei County, the "Young Pioneers Forest" planted by students, as well as the "Militia Forest" and "Patriotic Forest," all have very high survival rates. In the construction of sandbreak forests, many afforestation model figures have emerged. Wang Guobao, an afforestation model in Jingbian County, northern Shaanxi, planted 6,000 trees this year and also gave more than 1,000 seedlings to others, all of which he cultivated himself diligently.

When planting trees in the barren sand, the People's Governments and people in various places along the sandbreak line in the Northwest Region overcame many difficulties. For example, the fixation of shifting sand, the selection of tree species, and the orientation of sunlight and wind direction all required careful planning. Just the work of fixing sand required sealing off sand and protecting grass, prohibiting firewood collection in sand pits, and therefore, the fuel problem of the local residents had to be solved. To this end, the Dengkou Sandbreak Forest Farm in Ningxia Province helped residents organize fuel cooperatives and develop the Heguaizi coal mine. As a result, the area sealed off for sand protection and grass protection this spring reached 4.5 million mu (around farmland, without affecting animal husbandry). This spring, Minqin County, Gansu Province, used white thorns, branches, and *bai mao* to weave eight hundred li of windbreaks around farmland, which played a significant role in fixing sand. Other places have also generally selected *sha hao*, *sha peng*, and other deep-rooted, fast-growing grasses to fix shifting sand on barren sand or in tree gaps. In addition, for example, sand dunes greatly hinder afforestation. Trees are not easy to survive on the dunes, and the sand particles on the dunes will roll with the wind and bury the seedlings if planted at the bottom of the dunes. If the dunes are to be fixed, there has been no precedent since ancient times. Ma Jiyao, an afforestation model in Minqin County, Gansu Province, led more than 300 people to carry mud and cover four large sand dunes that were more than one hundred zhang long and forty to fifty zhang wide, and sowed yellow grass on them, and planted grass and trees around them. Now these four sand dunes are lush green. Local farmers happily said, "These four sand tigers are trapped in cages."

At present, the afforestation farms, stations, and hundreds of thousands of farmers on the sandbreak line are actively preparing tools and seedlings to welcome the upcoming autumn afforestation movement. Everyone is full of confidence to strive for greater victories.

### 西北区正沿长城建立三千里长的防沙林

    西北区正沿长城建立三千里长的防沙林
    西北区沿长城约三千里长的防沙林，正陆续建立起来。现在，防沙林东自陕西北端的榆林西至甘肃的酒泉已造有十二万九千多亩，几年内将可逐渐联结起来成为一座绿的“长城”，挡住沙患内侵，卫护数百万亩农田。在西北区，从宁夏省磴口县到甘肃省酒泉县，每年有长达七个月的风沙期，而全年雨量却不到五十公厘。在新中国成立前漫长的岁月里，由于风沙侵袭，陕西省北部的榆林城，曾三次被迫南迁，磴口以南的黄河，也有三百里长的河身被荒沙淹淤，很多村庄和田园也曾被埋没。
    新中国诞生后，人民政府即开始注意防沙林的伟大建设。西北军政委员会农林部一九五零年即在防沙线上建立了十七个营造防沙林的场、站等机构，着手勘察设计。一九五一年春暖解冻时，防沙线上约五十万农民在人民政府领导下，开始向沙漠搏斗，营造树林。去年共造林四万多亩。到了今年，造林运动更加普遍深入。防沙线上的一个拥有二十一万人口的民勤县，就有十三万人参加了造林运动。宁夏省磴口县今春男女一千六百人就造林三千七百亩，成活率高达百分之九十。中卫县妇女所造的“三八林”，学生所造的“少年儿童林”以及“民兵林”“爱国林”等成活率都很高。在防沙林的建造中，出现了许多造林模范人物。陕北靖边县造林模范王国宝，今年一个人栽树六千株，另外还送给别人一千多株树苗，这些树苗都是他自己辛勤培育的。
    在荒沙上造林时，西北区沿防沙线各地人民政府和人民，曾经克服了许多困难。如流沙的固定，树种的选择，阳光和风向的向背等，都得缜密计划。仅固沙一项工作，就要封沙护草，禁止在沙窝打柴，因此也就必须解决当地居民群众的燃料问题。为此，宁夏省磴口防沙林场曾帮助居民群众组织燃料合作社，开采河拐子煤矿，这样，今春封沙护草面积就达到四百五十万亩（在农田周围，不影响畜牧）。甘肃省民勤县今春在农田周围用白刺、树枝和芨芨草插编了八百里风墙，对固沙起了很大的作用。其他地方也普遍地在荒砂上或树隙里选种沙蒿、沙蓬等根子深生长快的草类来固定流沙。此外，譬如沙丘对造林的阻难很大，在丘上栽树不容易成活，在丘下栽树丘上的沙粒又会随风滚动，埋没树苗。若要把沙丘固定起来，从古以来又没有过。甘肃省民勤县造林模范马吉尧则领导三百多人背运泥土盖住了长达一百多丈宽达四五十丈的四座大沙丘，并在上面撒种黄蒿，在周围植草栽树，现在这四座沙丘已一片葱绿。当地农民都高兴地说：“这四只沙老虎囚在笼里了。”
    目前，防沙线上的各造林场、站和数十万农民，又在积极准备工具和树苗，迎接即将到来的秋季造林运动，每个人都满怀信心地要争取更大的胜利。
