Xinhua News Agency, September 5th:

    To understand how cooperatives are organizing urban-rural material exchange during the autumn peak season, given the good harvests of spring wheat and early rice across the country and the promising outlook for autumn crops, our reporter visited the head of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, who shared the following insights:

    The pre-purchase of cotton in major cotton-producing areas has concluded successfully, and local cooperatives are actively preparing for cotton collection and the acquisition of economic crops such as grain, hemp, and tobacco, as well as supply work.

    Regarding the supply and marketing work of cooperatives after this autumn, the head of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives pointed out that local cooperatives should pay attention to the following tasks:

    First, the focus of cotton collection work in all regions should be on recovering pre-purchased cotton. In September and October, with utmost urgency, cotton should be quickly delivered to spinning mills to meet production demands. This year, pre-purchased cotton accounts for more than 60% of the total cotton collected. Therefore, properly organizing the recovery of pre-purchased cotton plays a decisive role in completing this year's cotton collection task. It is also a measure of the quality of local cooperatives' pre-purchase cotton work and a test of cooperatives' fulfillment of contracts with cotton farmers.

    Second, this year, the acquisition of important crops such as grain, hemp, and tobacco by cooperatives should be organized for internal exchange within the cooperative system, under the principle of first completing the state's acquisition plan. At the same time, the quantity acquired by cooperatives should be based on the supply plan of the cooperatives, making the acquisition work planned rather than blind.

    Third, continued attention should be paid to the exchange of minor local products. Since the All-China Federation of Cooperatives issued instructions to local cooperatives in March to promote short-distance exchange of minor local products, some provincial and county cooperatives, under the leadership of local Party organizations and People's Governments at all levels, have actively organized the exchange of minor local products within the cooperative system and participated in local product exchanges in their regions. According to incomplete statistics, the total value of minor local products sold nationwide reached approximately two trillion yuan, playing a certain role in opening up sales channels for minor local products and invigorating the rural market. The exchange meeting organized by the Xingning County Cooperative in Guangdong Province involved the purchase and sale of 83 kinds of local products (minor local products accounted for 70%), with a total transaction value of over 8 billion yuan.

    After the autumn harvest, provincial and county-level cooperatives in all regions should convene a small local product exchange meeting within the cooperative system based on the market launch time of local specialties, to solve the purchase and sale problems of local specialties, and use this as a preparatory meeting for participating in local material exchange meetings convened after autumn.

    Fourth, the cooperative system must combine with acquisition work to vigorously carry out material supply work to meet the needs of farmers for means of production and consumer goods after selling their products. Therefore, close cooperation should be established with state-owned trade and enterprises, and material supply contracts should be signed, especially to strengthen the procurement of local industrial products and handicrafts to fully guarantee the source of goods.

    The head of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives finally pointed out: To ensure the smooth completion of the above tasks, cooperatives at all levels must first unreservedly disclose their costs to state-owned trade organizations and within the cooperative system. Second, the four fixed rates must be implemented—the capital and commodity turnover rate, the circulation expense rate, the comprehensive profit rate, and the commodity damage rate. Third, two decisions on supply and sales work passed at the Second Provisional Council and Supervisory Board Joint Meeting of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives in July should be implemented.

    To complete these heavy business tasks and the new construction of the cooperative system, a mass-based competition movement is indispensable. The production increase and conservation competition movement within the cooperative system has already been launched in North China and Northeast China, and other regions are being organized and will be launched successively soon. This is a guarantee for promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, finding tricks, tapping potential, and completing the above tasks.

    全国合作总社负责人
    谈秋后旺季如何组织城乡物资交流工作
    【新华社五日讯】今年全国各地春麦早稻丰收，秋季作物丰收景象已定。为了解合作社在秋后旺季如何组织城乡物资交流工作，本社记者特走访全国合作总社负责人，承其发表谈话如下：
    全国各主要产棉区的预购棉花工作已经胜利结束，各地合作社正积极进行收棉，及收购粮、麻、烟等经济作物的各项准备和供应工作。
    关于今年秋后合作社的供销工作，全国合作总社负责人指出各地合作社应注意下列几件工作：
    第一，各地合作社的收棉工作，应将重点放在收回预购棉上，并应在九、十月份以极紧张的精神，把棉花迅速地送到纱厂，以满足生产的要求。今年预购棉花数占收棉总数的百分之六十以上，因此，如何良好地组织预购棉的收回工作，对于完成今年收棉任务有着决定作用，同时这也是衡量各地合作社预购棉花工作好坏的标准，也是合作社与棉农履行合同的考验。
    第二，今年合作社对粮、麻、烟等重要农作物的收购，应在首先完成国家收购计划的原则下，组织合作社内部的交流工作。同时合作社的收购数量，应当根据合作社的供应计划，使收购工作成为有计划的而不是盲目的收购。
    第三，要继续注意小土产的交流工作。自全国合作总社三月份向各地合作社发出开展短距离小土产交流的指示以后，部分地区省、县合作社在中共各级地方组织和人民政府领导下，曾积极组织了合作社系统的小土产交流，并参加了本地区的土产交流。据不完全的统计，全国推销小土产总值约达两万亿元，对于打开小土产的销路，活跃农村市场起了一定作用。广东省兴宁县合作社组织的一次土产交流会议，即购销土产八十三种（小土产占百分之七十）交易总额达八十余亿元。
    在秋收以后，各地省、县以上合作社，均应根据本地区土产特产品上市时间，召开一次合作社系统的小土产交流会议，以解决本地区土产特产品的购销问题，并以此作为参加本地秋后召开的物资交流会议的准备会议。
    第四，合作社系统必须与收购工作相结合，以大力作好物资供应工作，以满足农民在出售产品后，对生产资料、生活资料的需要。因此，应与国营贸易和企业密切结合，订立物资供应合同，尤其要加强对地方工业品、手工业品的采购工作，以充分保证商品的来源。
    全国合作总社负责人最后指出：为使上述工作顺利完成，各级合作社首先必须向国营贸易机关和在合作社系统中，无保留地公开自己的成本。其次，必须贯彻四项定率——资金与商品周转率，流转费用率，综合利润率，商品伤耗率。第三、执行今年七月全国合作总社第二次临时理事、监事联席会议关于供应工作和推销工作的两个决定。
    要完成这些繁重的业务工作和合作社系统的新的建设，没有一个群众性的竞赛运动是不可能的。合作社系统的增产节约竞赛运动，已在华北、东北两区展开，其他地区正在布置中，不久也可陆续展开。这是发扬全体职工的积极性和创造性，找窍门，挖潜力，完成上述工作的保证。
