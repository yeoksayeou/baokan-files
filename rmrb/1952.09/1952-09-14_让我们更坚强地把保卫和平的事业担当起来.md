    Let Us More Firmly Undertake the Cause of Defending Peace
    Xu Guangping, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation

    In today's world, what is more precious than the two words "peace"?

    The third issue of "Soviet Woman" published a picture drawn by Soviet painter H. Zhukov - in a rear village in Korea, burning with raging flames after being bombed by American planes, a Korean child, panic-stricken, stretched out two small hands, struggling in the sea of ​​fire. The flames will soon scorch this innocent life.

    This kind of thing is one of the facts that has been constantly occurring since the American imperialists invaded Korea, and it is still increasing. This not only makes us mothers feel very heartbroken, but all kind people in the world who see this scene, who is not frightened?

    According to the calculations of Soviet economist Leontief, the First World War killed 10 million people and cost 200 billion US dollars; the Second World War killed 50 million people and cost about 1 trillion US dollars. In the ongoing Korean War, the American imperialists' destructive and brutal acts have already caused millions of women, children, and men to die, and the losses cannot be calculated in numbers. If a third world war is allowed to happen, then more innocent people will inevitably suffer death, and a large number of peaceful cities, villages, and properties will be destroyed. What a profound disaster this will be for the people of the world! We must stop it, and we believe that the peace-loving people of the world uniting together can definitely stop it!

    However, the American warmongers, in order to satisfy Wall Street's insatiable desire for exorbitant profits, are actively preparing for a third world war. They regard all peace-loving people in the world as enemies. They are reviving the Nazi forces in West Germany and the militarist forces in Japan in the Far East, as the two wheels for launching a large-scale war of aggression. They have committed appalling crimes in Korea, indiscriminately bombing and strafing, and using bacteriological and chemical weapons. They used various delaying and sabotaging tactics in the armistice negotiations. … This has made world peace, especially the peace in Asia and the Pacific region, subject to unprecedented severe threats, and the people of Asia and the Pacific region are facing the danger of a new war disaster.

    At this time, it is entirely understandable that the people of Asian and Pacific countries warmly welcome the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference to extensively exchange views on the issue of saving peace and seek solutions for saving peace and security.

    I would like to pay my highest respects to the people of all countries who are actively carrying out the work of welcoming the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference! In order to protect our children from the scourge of war, for the common long-term interests of the 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region, and for the happiness of the people of the world, let us more firmly undertake the cause of defending peace!

    让我们更坚强地把保卫和平的事业担当起来
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席　许广平
    在今天的世界上，还有什么比“和平”二字更值得宝贵的呢？
    “苏联妇女”第三期登载了苏联画家H·茹科夫绘的一幅图画——在美国飞机轰炸后正燃烧着熊熊火焰的朝鲜后方村庄上，一个朝鲜的小孩，张皇失措地伸展着两只小手，在火海里挣扎。火焰很快地将烧焦这无辜的小生命。
    这种事情是美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜以来经常不断发生的事实之一，到现在还是有加无已的。这不但使我们做母亲的人感到十分痛心，全世界所有善良的人们见到这种情景，又那一个不心惊胆战？
    根据苏联经济学家列昂节夫的计算，第一次世界大战死亡一千万人，耗费二千亿美元；第二次世界大战死亡五千万人，耗费约达一万亿美元。现在还在进行的朝鲜战争中，美帝国主义的毁灭性的残暴行为，已经使上百万的妇女、孩子和男人死亡，损失不能以数字计算。如果让第三次世界大战得以发生，那就必然有更多的无辜人民遭受死亡，大量的和平城市、乡村和财产会遭到毁灭，这将是全世界人民多么深重的灾难！我们一定要制止它，相信全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来一定能制止它！
    然而美国的战争贩子们为了满足华尔街无厌的暴利欲望，正积极准备着第三次世界大战。他们视全世界爱好和平的人民为仇敌。他们在西欧复活西德的纳粹势力，在远东复活日本的军国主义势力，当作它发动大规模侵略战争的两个车轮。他们在朝鲜犯下了惊人的罪行，滥肆轰炸扫射，而且使用了细菌武器和化学武器。他们在停战谈判中使用了各种拖延破坏的手段。……这就使得世界和平，特别是亚洲和太平洋区域的和平受到空前的严重的威胁，亚洲和太平洋区域的人民已面临新的战争灾难的危险。
    在这个时候，亚洲、太平洋区域的各国人民热烈地迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，对拯救和平的问题广泛地交换意见和寻求拯救和平与安全的方案，是完全可以理解的。
    我谨向正积极展开迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作的各国人民致以崇高的敬礼！为了保护我们的孩子不再受战火的浩劫，为了我们亚洲和太平洋区域十六亿人民共同的长远的利益，为了全世界人民的幸福，让我们更坚强地把保卫和平的事业担当起来！
