Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st dispatch from TASS: The United Nations Security Council held meetings on September 17th and 18th to discuss the issue of Japan's application to join the United Nations. The United States representative put forward a proposal recommending the acceptance of Japan into the United Nations.

The United States representative and representatives of other countries in the US-British bloc who followed him spoke in support of the US proposal. The United States representative insisted that Japan had become a "sovereign state," a "peace-loving" country.

The Soviet representative, Malik, spoke, stating the Soviet Union's attitude towards the issue of accepting Japan into the United Nations, and criticizing the United States' behavior in engaging in activities for Japan's entry into the United Nations. Malik said: The Soviet delegation believes that it is not appropriate to discuss the issue of accepting Japan into the United Nations at this time. The Soviet delegation firmly insists on delaying the discussion to a more appropriate time, after the Japanese people have been freed from the disasters caused by foreign occupation, and the Japanese people and the Japanese state have become free, independent, and autonomous, the Japanese people have been freed from foreign occupation, and the Japanese people have concluded normal treaties of peace with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. Undoubtedly, only then will it be possible to examine Japan's application to join the United Nations under normal circumstances and through normal procedures, and to accept Japan's participation in this international organization on the basis of free and equal relations. This will eventually be realized sooner or later. Today, all the thoughts and efforts of patriots from all walks of life in Japanese society are focused on how to restore the ravaged national sovereignty, and on how to promote the withdrawal of the occupying forces and the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty.

In his speech, Malik also pointed out that the United States representative's statement was untenable. Malik cited concrete facts and examples to prove that Japan today is actually a colony of the United States, not a "sovereign state" as the United States representative claimed.

The US proposal was put to a vote on the 18th. Representatives of the US-British bloc countries voted in favor. The Soviet representative voted against. The US proposal did not pass because it did not receive the unanimous affirmative vote of the five permanent members.

    在联合国安全理事会上
    苏联否决美国建议接受日本加入联合国案
    主张到日本人民获得自由独立后再予讨论
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会于九月十七、十八日举行会议，讨论日本申请加入联合国问题。美国代表提出提案，建议接受日本加入联合国。
    美国代表以及追随他的美英集团其他国家代表发言支持美国提案。美国代表硬说日本已成为一个“主权国家”、一个“爱好和平”的国家。
    苏联代表马立克发言表明苏联对于接受日本加入联合国问题的态度，并抨击正在为日本加入联合国从事活动的美国的态度。马立克说：苏联代表团认为目前讨论接受日本加入联合国问题是不合时宜的。苏联代表团并且坚决主张延迟到比较适当的时候，到日本人民摆脱了外国占领所造成的灾难，日本人民与日本国家已经自由、独立与自主，日本人民摆脱了外国的占领，日本人民与苏联和中华人民共和国缔结了正常的和约时，再讨论日本的申请。无疑的，到那时才有可能在正常的情况下，以正常的手续来审查日本加入联合国问题，并在自由与平等关系的基础上接受日本参加这个国际组织。这迟早终会实现的。今天，日本社会各阶层的爱国者的一切思想与努力，都集中在如何恢复被蹂躏着的民族主权上，集中在如何促使占领军撤退与缔结全面和约问题上。
    马立克在发言中并指出美国代表的说法是站不住脚的。马立克列举具体事实与例子，证明今天的日本实际上是美国的一个殖民地，而不是如美国代表所说的一个“主权国家”。
    美国提案在十八日付表决。美英集团国家代表投票赞成。苏联代表投票反对。美国提案由于没有得到五常任理事国一致的可决票，未获得通过。
