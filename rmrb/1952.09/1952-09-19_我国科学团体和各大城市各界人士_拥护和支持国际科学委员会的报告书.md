In their statements, the various organizations expressed high praise for the working spirit of the members of the International Scientific Commission and the fair and scientific attitude of their report. The joint statement of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Dissemination said: "On the major issue concerning the fate of mankind, the members of the International Scientific Commission, disregarding the possible threats and dangers to themselves, solemnly assumed the responsibility that scientific workers should bear, proving that the American imperialists had used inhumane bacteriological weapons on a large scale. This selfless fighting spirit sets a brilliant example for scientists around the world who are working for peace and human happiness." The joint statement of the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Society for Microbiology, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, and the Chinese Nurses Association believes that "the members of the International Scientific Commission overcame all kinds of difficulties, spared no effort or danger, and conducted in-depth and direct investigations and research. Therefore, this report has the highest degree of scientific validity." The statement of the Entomological Society of China also expressed great admiration for the International Scientific Commission's pragmatic scientific attitude of starting with investigation and research and then drawing conclusions.

The statements of the various organizations unanimously believe that the publication of this report will give a powerful blow to the American imperialists who are accustomed to denying their guilt, and will make a lofty contribution to the cause of human peace. The Entomological Society of China said in its statement: "After careful and in-depth investigation and research, the members of the International Scientific Commission dispelled their past doubts and, based on the facts, made a scientific conclusion—affirming that the American army had used bacteriological weapons in Korea and Northeast China. This fact can no longer be denied by the propaganda of the American government." The joint statement of the Zoological Society of China and the Botanical Society of China expressed sincere support and gratitude to the scientists of the International Scientific Commission, and believed that all peace-loving and just people in the world would support this report. Science will surely be victorious, and peace will surely be victorious!

The statements of the various organizations also expressed their determination to support and respond to the International Scientific Commission's call to "prevent scientific inventions from being used to destroy mankind." The joint statement of the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Society for Microbiology, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Association, and the Chinese Nurses Association said: "We Chinese medical and health workers wholeheartedly support and strive to realize the call of the International Scientific Commission.

The statement of the Entomological Society of China said: "We Chinese entomological workers have always been working faithfully in the spirit of science benefiting mankind, striving to eliminate various pests to improve the people's living standards. We oppose the use of the achievements of human scientific work in any way to create disasters for mankind."

[This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency: After seeing the report of the International Scientific Commission on the investigation of bacteriological warfare facts, people from all walks of life in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, Xi'an and other cities have successively issued statements supporting the just conclusions and solemn appeals in the report.

The people of all circles in the capital unanimously believe that the crimes of the American aggressors have been proven beyond doubt. In order to protect the survival and happiness of mankind, it is now time for every peace-loving people in the world to unite more closely and effectively and resolutely stop the heinous bacteriological warfare. Tang Feifan, a biological expert and director of the Institute of Biological Products of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, said: The members of the International Scientific Commission are world-renowned scholars and unbiased scientists. The investigation report they published has completely bankrupted the shameless conspiracy of the American imperialists to deceive the world. Zhu Guiqing, professor of internal medicine at the Peking Union Medical College, said: The report provided by the International Scientific Commission is beneficial to scientists and people of all countries (including the United States). All peace-loving people in the world, regardless of their political beliefs, will definitely believe after seeing this report that the United States has indeed carried out bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. Workers from various mines and factories in the capital, students from various schools, and representatives from literary and art circles, business circles, and various ethnic minorities such as the Hui, Tibetan, and Mongolian people residing in the capital, as well as religious groups such as Islam, Lamaism, and Buddhism, have earnestly studied and discussed the report of the International Scientific Commission and its related documents, and have expressed their determination to stop the heinous bacteriological warfare with practical actions.

Gao Chongmin, chairman of the Northeast General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, pointed out in his speech: The American imperialists' crime of conducting bacteriological warfare to exterminate humanity has long been irrefutable after on-the-spot investigations by the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and world-renowned figures such as Wen Youzhang and Fa Qi. Now, with the investigation report of the International Scientific Commission, the crime of the American imperialists in conducting bacteriological warfare has been more thoroughly and definitively exposed. We, the people of Northeast China, will continue to strengthen the patriotic health campaign and continue to crush the American bacteriological warfare! Zhang Kewei, chairman of the Northeast Federation of Natural Science Workers, and Wu Zhizhong, director of education and internal medicine expert at the China Medical University, both believe that the report of the International Scientific Commission is scientific, correct, and just. This report will give a heavy blow to American imperialism.

People from all walks of life in Shanghai were greatly encouraged by the publication of the report. Wu Yaozong, chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Reform Movement of the Chinese Christian Church, said: "There is a saying in the Christian Bible: 'Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, and nothing hidden that will not be known.' The report of the International Scientific Commission is the crystallization of truth and justice. Through this report, the voice of human justice has been expressed once again." Hu Wenyu, president of Shanghai Aurora University, said: "We Chinese Catholics hope that Catholics who believe in Jesus's doctrine of universal love will also stand up and speak justly, and stand up against this inhuman behavior of the American government." Jiang Zhaoju, director of the Shanghai International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, said: "All of us maternity and child health workers are working hard to defend peace and the health of women and children. When American imperialism is trying its best to harm mankind, our responsibility is even greater. We hope that medical workers all over the world will take practical actions to stop the heinous crimes of American imperialism."

Zhu Xianyi, a famous internist in Tianjin, believes that the conclusion of the International Scientific Commission's report "powerfully shattered the deceptive propaganda of the American government and made people all over the world see how the war-mongers are stealing scientific achievements and trying to destroy mankind's ambitions." Xiao Caiyu, professor of biology at Nankai University, believes that the investigation conclusion of the International Scientific Commission is the most authoritative. This conclusion will give a heavy blow to American imperialism!

Ma Zhemin, vice chairman of the Wuhan Municipal People's Congress Consultative Committee, said: "All people with conscience and a sense of justice in the world will rise up to condemn and stop the heinous crimes of American imperialism in carrying out bacteriological warfare." Li Zhendgang, professor of the Central China Agricultural College and expert in entomology, said: "In order to save science, I support the report of the International Scientific Commission with the greatest gratitude, and I am willing to do everything in my power to carry the fight against bacteriological warfare to the end."

Sun Gebaton, director of the Panchen Erdeni's Office in Chongqing, warmly praised and supported the report published by the international scientists with a fair, objective, and scientific attitude. He said: "The Tibetan people are extremely angry after seeing the American aggressors' heinous crime of killing people with bacteria so barbarically. Recently, we have received many letters from the Tibetan people, firmly expressing their will to fight together with the people of the whole country to save peace." Ran Ruitu, former captain of the Chongqing Volunteer Surgical Team to Aid Korea and director of the Surgery Department of the Chongqing Municipal Second Hospital, said: "The contributions made by the scientists of the International Scientific Commission and our Chinese scientists and medical experts in this investigation clearly pointed out to scientific and medical workers around the world: serving peace will be the most noble responsibility of scientific and medical workers."

Zhang Zhaoli, vice chairman of the Chinese Medical Association in Xi'an, believes that Mrs. Andreen's view on why the bacteriological warfare waged by the United States in Korea and Northeast China did not cause epidemics is completely correct. He said: "In the Northwest region with a population of more than 30 million, more than 620 tons of flies have been eliminated since the launch of the health campaign this summer. This shows that the Chinese people have a high level of hygiene and have the confidence and strength to eliminate the American bacteriological warfare."
