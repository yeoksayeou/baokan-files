    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] The people of Latin American countries are actively preparing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    In Chile, after Mr. Ventulelli, the representative who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, returned home, he reported on the preparatory meeting to the National Executive Committee and the representatives of the provincial branches of the Chilean Peace Committee, which was warmly welcomed by the audience. Currently, the Executive Committee of the Chilean Committee for Initiating Participation in the Peace Conference has sent many printed materials related to the Peace Conference to all parts of the country and has achieved results. One hundred and forty peace branches in various provinces of Chile have begun activities to support the Peace Conference and discuss the declaration of the preparatory meeting. A peace signature campaign entitled "Congratulations to the Beijing Peace Conference" is underway, which started in Arica City. The national peace movement publication issued in Chile will publish a special issue on the Beijing Conference. The Executive Committee is conducting a movement against germ warfare through radio broadcasts, newspapers, and mass rallies, and will hold significant demonstrations on issues of peaceful coexistence and cultural exchange in the Pacific region.
    According to a report in the Guatemalan newspaper "Nuestro Diario," the Guatemalan General Confederation of Workers invited various labor organizations on August 12 to participate in an important gathering organized by the Guatemalan Peace Committee. Gonzalez, Sanchez, and Valenzuela, the Guatemalan representatives who signed the declaration of the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, reported on the achievements of the preparatory meeting held in Beijing in June. A film on germ warfare was screened after the meeting.
    The Nicaraguan Workers' Peace Committee held a meeting on August 14, where Professor Torres, who visited China in June this year, reported on the achievements of New China, which aroused great interest among the audience. Torres enthusiastically described the Chinese industries, trade unions, and schools he visited, saying: The Chinese people live happily, and the people are no longer exploited; colonialists have been driven out of mainland China. The Chinese people and their vanguard are doing everything possible to turn their country into the most prosperous and progressive country in the world.
    In Colombia, after Mr. Bayona, the representative who attended the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, returned home, he held several meetings with various peace committees, organizations, and peace advocates, and emphasized that the Colombian people must have broad representation to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The Colombian newspapers "People's Vanguard" and "New Era" widely introduced the significance of the Peace Conference, and the National Peace Committee's official newspaper "Peace Democracy" is also preparing to publish a special issue reporting on the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the World People's Peace Congress. On August 15, the National Peace Council held a plenary meeting in Bogota, with representatives from local committees in various cities and provinces participating.
    Currently, in addition to Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, El Salvador, and Honduras, which have already formed delegations, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama have also successively formed delegations to attend the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
