    Fourteen. He hurried to the county farm to ask, and the comrades at the county farm patted him on the shoulder and said: "Don't panic, after trampling the grass, your rice is guaranteed to grow stronger than theirs."

Sure enough, in less than ten days, Wang Shugui's rice grew lush and strong, with thirty or forty shoots per clump, a third thicker than other people's clumps and more than an inch taller. Everyone came to visit again, and some said: "This is the first time in my life I've encountered such a strange thing." Wang Shugui replied: "You are using old eyes to look at the new society; there are many more strange things!"

    十四、他连忙跑到县农场去问，县农场的同志拍着他的肩膀说：“别着慌，踩草后，你的禾保险比他们的长得壮。”
    十五、果然，不到十天，王树桂的禾就长得又绿又壮，每兜都发了三四十根，比别人的禾兜粗三分之一，高出一寸多。大家又来参观，有人说：“一辈子头一次碰到这件怪事。”王树桂接着说：“你们用老眼光来看新社会，怪事还多着哩！”
