    Soviet International Book Company
    Donates a Batch of New Russian Books to China
    [By Our Newspaper] The Soviet International Book Company recently shipped 6,060 copies of new book samples from the Soviet Union to donate to the Publication Administration of the Central People's Government of China. These books were specially selected by the Soviet International Book Company for translation and publication in China. This batch of books includes Marxist-Leninist theory, natural science and applied technology books, literary and artistic works, and teaching textbooks. In the future, new books published in the Soviet Union will continue to be sent directly to the Publication Administration by the company. The Publication Administration is currently compiling a Chinese title catalog of the books it has received for reference by various agencies, organizations, schools, and publishers, and is organizing the translation community to systematically translate and publish them.
