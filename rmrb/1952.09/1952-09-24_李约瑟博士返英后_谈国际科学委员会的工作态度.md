　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 22nd (TASS dispatch):
　　The "Workers' Daily" reporter interviewed Dr. Joseph Needham, a member of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," on the 21st after his return to England. Dr. Needham recalled that during World War II, the British government commissioned him to investigate the facts of Japan's bacteriological warfare in China. Needham told the reporter that because he understood Chinese, the committee would not have any difficulty understanding the various written or oral evidence obtained. Needham was able to check all translations and ask questions in Chinese. Needham said, "We were not judges or lawyers there, but experts who should draw authoritative conclusions, and we have done so." Needham said that every word of the report published by the committee was "carefully considered many times."

    李约瑟博士返英后
    谈国际科学委员会的工作态度
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十二日讯：
    “工人日报”记者二十一日访问刚返国的“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”委员李约瑟博士。李约瑟追述第二次世界大战时英国政府曾委托他调查日本在中国进行细菌战的事实。李约瑟告诉记者说，因为他懂中文，所以在获得的书面或口头的种种证据中，委员会不致于会有什么不能了解的地方。李约瑟有能力检查一切翻译，并用中文提出询问。李约瑟说：“我们在那里不是法官或律师，而是应当作出权威的结论的专家，而我们已经这样做了。”李约瑟说：委员会公布的报告的每一个字都是“经过多次斟酌的”。
