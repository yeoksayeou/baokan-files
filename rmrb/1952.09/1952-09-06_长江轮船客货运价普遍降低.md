Xinhua News Agency, September 5th:

    Yangtze River trunk line steamer passenger and freight rates have been universally reduced, effective September 1st. In terms of passenger transport: the Hankou-Shanghai line is reduced by 9%, the Hankou-Yichang line is reduced by 4.8%, and the Yichang-Chongqing line is reduced by 5.5%. In terms of freight transport: the Hankou-Shanghai line is reduced by 20.4%, the Hankou-Yichang line is reduced by 12% upstream and 15.2% downstream, and the Yichang-Chongqing line is reduced by 10% upstream and 14.8% downstream. Freight rates for eighty kinds of goods, such as cotton, tobacco, edible oil, and medicinal materials, have been reduced by an average of about 30%.
    This universal reduction in passenger and freight rates is the result of the Yangtze River trunk line steamer workers actively learning from advanced Soviet experience, implementing the "one-train towing method," increasing towing capacity, and reducing shipping costs. This price reduction will further promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

    长江轮船客货运价普遍降低
    【新华社五日讯】长江干线轮船客货运价自九月一日起普遍降低。在客运方面：汉（口）申（上海）线降低百分之九，汉（口）宜（昌）线降低百分之四点八，宜（昌）渝（重庆）线降低百分之五点五。在货运方面：汉申线降低百分之二十点四，汉宜线上水降低百分之十二，下水降低百分之十五点二，宜渝线上水降低百分之十，下水降低百分之十四点八。棉花、烟叶、食油、药材等八十种货物运价，平均降低约百分之三十左右。
    这次客货运价的普遍降低，是长江干线轮船职工积极学习苏联先进经验，实行“一列式拖带法”，提高拖运量，降低航运成本的结果。此次运价降低后，将进一步促进城乡物资交流。
