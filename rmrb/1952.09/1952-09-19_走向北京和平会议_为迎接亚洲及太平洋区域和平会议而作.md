    Heading Towards the Beijing Peace Conference
    -- Written to Welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Suluso, Representative of Indonesia to the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    We still remember that seven years ago, when Asia was trampled under the iron heel of the brutal and vicious Japanese fascism, they put forward the slogan "Japan is the leader and protector of Asia."

    We still remember: the peasants' rice was taken away and replaced with snails as food; the yellow cattle and water buffalo were robbed by "collectivization"; the children were conscripted as "military supplements" to be cannon fodder; the fathers were conscripted as "laborers" and sent everywhere, even abroad, to perform labor, and the reward they received was only trousers made of sacks.

    Who can forget the plundering of gold, silver, and diamond jewelry? These things were said to be important raw materials for making bombs and bullets, but in fact they were piled up in the Japanese fascists' banks in Tokyo.

    Can we forget that students were sent every day to sweep the streets, find pests, and collect castor beans, that thousands upon thousands of holy sites were trampled on and arbitrarily occupied by fascist soldiers, that young girls were brutally raped, that parents sold their children for a mouthful of food, and that thousands of people died of starvation on the roadside every day?

    We have not forgotten that the so-called digging of air-raid shelters to prevent air raids was actually used to bury national heroes and defenders of humanity who were cruelly murdered by Japanese fascist executioners.

    Japanese fascists treated human beings as if they were donkeys to be manipulated, who could be innocently abused and slaughtered at any time. In the eyes of fascists, human beings were no longer intelligent creatures but were treated like stray dogs wandering on the streets, and no law protected them.

    The scene of seven years ago, like something that happened just a few hours ago, continues to flood our minds. And now, through the shameless measures of reviving Japanese militarism, American imperialism is about to, and has already begun to, replay the cruel crimes of seven years ago. War criminals are being released and reinstated to lead the executioners who are being trained and expanded every day. The slogan "Japan is the leader of Asia" is beginning to resound again. With their past experience, coupled with the armament of American imperialism, they will surely be more cruel and more vicious.

    If, seven years ago, newspapers and magazines and bulletin boards were filled with figures and pictures advertising the victories of the "Great Japanese Army," and slogans such as "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Long live His Majesty the Emperor," then today what we see are magazines, newspapers, and novels from the United States Information Service marked with the grand themes of so-called freedom, democracy, and peace, and decorated with pictures of semi-nude girls and murderous weapons such as cannons, bombs, and bombers. If, seven years ago, cinemas only showed films promoting the power of the so-called Great East Asia Holy War, then today we see American films performing hula dances and creating stories of narrow national hatred, and resonating with the explosions of American cannons and bombs that are currently spreading disaster and death in Korea, Malaya, Vietnam, and other places. The attempt of imperialism to corrupt and degenerate the peace-loving Indonesian people is truly vicious and despicable.

    If Japanese fascism plundered the people's wealth and living resources in a crude manner, then the American imperialists used other tactics, namely, by implementing embargoes and extremely restrictive so-called technical and economic assistance, to bring the Indonesian people to the abyss of suffering and poverty.

    Now less than 40 percent of the Indonesian national capital textile factories in East Java are operating, and 67 percent of the sarong factories (printed cloth factories) have closed down, and the rest cannot be fully operational; hundreds of textile factories, tobacco factories, glass factories, and supply and marketing cooperatives in West Java and other places have closed down; the rubber industry, which is the source of livelihood for most people in Sumatra, has mostly been forced to stop work, resulting in a sharp decline in production (for example, in Bangka and Belitung, the output in March 1952 was only 546,142 tons, while in January 1952 it was 749,868 tons, and in January 1951 it was 1,333,406 tons); this is because the market and shops are filled with "Made in America" goods, and the entire commodity market is manipulated and monopolized by Wall Street tycoons.

    The loss of the people's livelihood resources has naturally resulted in increased unemployment and famine. This situation can be proved by the following facts: in the first quarter of 1952, there were 15,784 unemployed people in West Java, which means that unemployment increased by 41 percent, and those unemployed people are all people with family burdens. Also, there was the famine that occurred in Central Java in May of this year, threatening the survival of 67,000 people.

    It is upon the painful groans of begging children, unemployed and wandering workers, hungry farmers, out-of-school youths, and helpless industrialists and businessmen that a small group of imperialists are calculating the gold dollars flowing in from Indonesia. They are planning even more vicious things. The Indonesian people, who have already fallen into suffering and poverty, are now being dragged into preparations for launching aggression. They are forcing Indonesia in various ways to accept the "Mutual Security Act," the "Pacific Pact," the "San Francisco Treaty," etc., including the sending of Mr. Chirino to Indonesia in July of this year, who, in addition to spending the blood and sweat money of the Indonesian people, also made remarks that violated the will of the Indonesian people, saying that Indonesia was prepared to participate in the signing of the "Pacific Pact."

    We can see the fear and pain they feel for their own destiny from the faces of millions of Indonesian people. American imperialism has turned the bright future of millions of Indonesian people into a future full of haze. This is the result of the American war policy. The germ bombs dropped on Korea not only harm the Korean people, but also will harm the people of the world, including the Indonesian people. This is easy to understand, because Indonesia is located in the international transportation hub, and Indonesia has a dense population and lacks medical personnel, and germs cannot be prevented by barriers along the border. If Indonesia is dragged into the imperialist aggression plan in the future, then the incident of the massacre of prisoners of war on Geoje Island is not impossible to happen in Indonesia. Due to the massacre incident in this prisoner-of-war camp, American imperialism has attempted to drag Indonesia into its conspiracy of aggression propaganda, to make Indonesia their witness and defender. Because it is very clear that the places they let the inspection team inspect are all places they have arranged and prepared in advance.

    These things all prove that the preparations for war by imperialism not only cause suffering to the American people, but also bring disaster and poverty to the Indonesian people and other people in the Asian and Pacific regions.

    If the restoration of Japanese militarism is a direct threat to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, then all the measures taken by American imperialism in Indonesia have stifled the Indonesian people's peaceful life and desire for peace.

    Can we tolerate the re-enactment of the events of seven years ago and turn a blind eye to the current situation? Even a shepherd boy would answer: No, I don't want to see people starving to death again. A rickshaw puller will never want to put down his rickshaw and become a "laborer," or put on a uniform to serve the war profiteers. A mother will never allow her child to be a "military supplement" and lose his personality. They must all shout: Stop! Stop all cruel and vicious measures!

    Their cries, past experiences, the reality we face today, and what may happen in the future, all give us a consistent determination and an indomitable spirit, so that we are closely united, contribute our entire spirit and strength, and defend peace.

    Now, the time has come. It is no longer that small group of imperialists who decide the fate of the world, but we, the millions of peace-loving people of all countries, will decide our peaceful and happy life in this world.

    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing will surely become a brilliant light, which will shine on the nations of the Asian and Pacific regions, making them aware of the disasters that are threatening their motherland, families, and homes. It will make people more convinced that peace will not come without struggle. This brilliant light will burst out with the light of peace.

    Therefore, let us, together with the people of Japan and the United States, jointly promote and strengthen the unity of all nations, and under the banner of peace, advance towards a world of peace and happiness. The struggle to defend peace will surely win! (Xinhua News Agency)

    走向北京和平会议
    ——为迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而作
    印度尼西亚出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议代表 苏鲁梭
    我们还记得，七年前，当亚洲被残暴凶恶的日本法西斯主义的铁蹄所践踏时，他们曾提出“日本是亚洲的领导者和保护者”的口号。
    我们还记得：农民的米被夺去，而以蜗牛代替粮食；黄牛和水牛被“组合”抢走；孩子们被征为“兵补”当炮灰；父亲被征去当“劳务者”，并被派到各处，甚至国外服劳役，而换来的酬报只是麻袋制成的裤子。
    谁能忘记搜刮金银和钻石首饰的事？这些东西据说是制造炸弹和枪弹的重要原料，其实是被堆积在日本法西斯在东京的银行里。
    难道我们能够忘记：学生每天被派去扫街道、找害虫和搜集蓖麻子，成千成万的圣地受到法西斯兵士的践踏和被任意占用，妙龄少女们被残暴强奸，父母们为了一口饭而出卖了自己的儿女，千百人民每天饿死在路旁？
    我们还没有忘记：所谓挖掘防空洞以预防空袭，其实那些防空洞是用来埋葬被日本法西斯刽子手们所残酷虐杀的民族英雄和人道的保卫者的。
    日本法西斯对待人类正如对待一匹任人摆布、随时都可能无辜地被虐待和屠杀的驴子一样。在法西斯主义者的眼中，人类不再是智慧的万物之灵，而是被当作在马路上流浪的丧家犬一样，没有一条法律是保护他们的。
    七年前的情景，正如数小时前所发生的事情一样，仍然继续涌现在我们的眼前。而现在，通过重新复活日本军国主义的无耻措施，美帝国主义将要、而且已经开始重演那七年前的残酷罪行。战犯们被释放、并且被复员以重新领导那些天天被训练和被扩充的刽子手们。“日本是亚洲的领导者”的口号又开始响彻云霄。凭着他们过去的经验，再加上美帝国主义的武装，他们必定会更加残酷和更加凶暴。
    假如说，七年前各报刊杂志上和布告板上都充满着宣传“大日本军”胜利的数字和图片，以及“大东亚共荣圈”、“天皇陛下万岁”等标语，那么今天我们所看到的是标着所谓自由世界的民主与和平的大题目，并饰以半裸体女郎和大炮、炸弹、轰炸机等杀人武器的图片的美国新闻处的杂志、报纸、小说。假如说，七年前的电影院只放映宣传所谓大东亚神圣战争的威力的影片，那么今天我们所看到的是一些美国影片在表演着草裙舞和制造狭隘的民族仇恨的故事，并震响着目前在朝鲜、马来亚、越南等地撒布灾难与死亡的美国大炮与炸弹的爆炸声。帝国主义使爱好和平的印尼人民腐化堕落的企图，实在是非常恶毒与卑鄙的。
    假如说，日本法西斯主义以粗野的方式掠夺了人民的财富与生活资源，那么美国帝国主义者是运用了别种策略，即以实行禁运及极有束缚性的所谓技术与经济援助的方式，把印尼人民带到痛苦与贫穷的深渊中去。
    现在东爪哇的印尼民族资本的纺织厂开工的不到百分之四十，而百分之六十七的花裙厂（印花布厂）已倒闭，其余的也不能完全开工；西爪哇等地的数百个纺织厂、烟草厂、玻璃厂及供销合作社等都倒闭了；成为苏门答腊岛大多数人民的生活资源的树胶业大多被迫停工，而使产量锐减（按在邦加与勿里洞，一九五二年三月的产量只有五十四万六千一百四十二吨，而在一九五二年一月却有七十四万九千八百六十八吨，一九五一年一月则有一百三十三万三千四百零六吨）；这就是由于市场上与商店里都充塞了“美国制造”的货品，整个商品市场都被华尔街的大亨们所操纵垄断的缘故。
    人民生活资源的丧失，当然造成了失业者增加与发生饥荒的后果。这种情形，可由以下的事实得到证明：一九五二年第一季中，在西爪哇有一万五千七百八十四个失业者，这就是说失业者增加了百分之四十一，而那些失业者又都是有家庭负担的人。还有，就是今年五月在中爪哇发生而威胁着六万七千个人民的生存的饥荒。
    就在讨饭的孩子们、失业流浪的工人、饥饿的农民、失学的青年、与不知所措的工商业家等的痛苦呻吟之上，一小撮帝国主义者正在计算着从印尼源源滚来的金元。他们计划着比这更恶毒的事。已陷入苦难与贫穷之中的印尼人民，现在又要被拖进发动侵略的准备中。他们以各种方式迫使印尼接受“共同安全法”、“太平洋公约”、“旧金山和约”等，其中如今年七月派了季里诺先生到印尼去，这位先生除开花费了印尼人民的血汗钱之外，还发表了违反印尼人民意旨的言论，说印尼准备参加签订“太平洋公约”。
    我们可以从千百万印尼人民的容貌上看到他们对自身命运所感到的恐惧与痛苦。美国帝国主义已把千百万印尼人民的光明前途变为阴霾密布的前途。这是美国战争政策造成的后果。落在朝鲜的细菌炸弹，不但危害着朝鲜人民，而且将危害着全世界人民，包括印尼人民在内。这是容易了解的，因为印尼位于国际交通要冲，而且印尼人口稠密，医学人材缺少，而细菌是不能用沿着国境的壁垒来阻止的。假如印尼将来被拖进了帝国主义的侵略计划中，那么像巨济岛屠杀战俘的事件，并不是不可能在印尼发生的。由于发生了这个战俘营的屠杀事件，美国帝国主义已企图把印尼拖进其侵略宣传的阴谋中，要把印尼做为他们的证人与辩护者。因为这是很明白的，他们让视察团视察的，都是他们预先布置和准备好的地方。
    这些事都证实了，帝国主义发动战争的准备不但使美国人民受到苦难，而且也给印尼及亚洲、太平洋区域的其他各地人民带来了灾难与穷苦。
    假如说日本的恢复军国主义是对亚洲、太平洋区域和平的直接威胁，那么美国帝国主义在印尼的一切措施已经扼杀了印尼人民的和平生活与和平愿望。
    难道我们能容忍七年前的事件重演而对目前的情况置之不理吗？一个牧童也会回答：不，我不愿再看到饿死的人。一个驶三轮车的人决不愿意放下自己的三轮车而做“劳务者”，或穿起制服为战争贩子效命。母亲决不允许她的孩子去当“兵补”而丧失其人格。他们一定都要高呼：停止！停止一切残酷与凶恶的措施！
    他们的呼声，过去的经验，我们目前所面对的现实以及将来可能产生的事，都使我们有一致的决心和不屈不挠的精神，使我们紧密地团结在一起，贡献我们的全部精神与力量，保卫和平。
    现在，时机已经到来了。决定世界命运的已经不再是那一小撮帝国主义者，我们千千万万爱好和平的各国人民将决定我们在这世界上的和平幸福的生活。
    将要在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，必将成为一道灿烂的光辉，它将照耀着亚洲及太平洋区域的各民族，使他们意识到那正在威胁着他们的祖国、家庭和庐舍的灾害。它将使人们更加坚信：没有斗争，和平是不会到来的。这一道灿烂的光辉，将会迸射出和平的光芒。
    因此，让我们与日本和美国的人民在一起，共同促进和加强各民族的团结，在和平的旗帜下，向着和平与幸福的世界前进。保卫和平的斗争必定胜利！（新华社）
