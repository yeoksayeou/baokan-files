Ordinary and Great People
    Zhang Zhimin
    On the Korean front, I met many heroes and meritorious soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and worked and fought alongside them. I was moved to tears several times by their heroic deeds, and I truly don't know what affectionate term to use to express my love and respect for them.
    The people I admire are all soldiers loyal to the motherland. Whether they are new soldiers who have just learned to shoot a gun, or veteran comrades who have been tempered for a long time, they have made brilliant contributions to the cause of peace, and have earth-shattering great deeds; each person's deeds can be written into a heroic biography; yet they themselves always feel that they are ordinary. When you talk to them, they will first and foremost sincerely tell you: "What I have done is still not enough. These achievements are mainly due to the leadership of the Party and the superiors, and the help of the comrades. We must continue to work hard..."
    At a celebration meeting of a certain army unit, I interviewed the hero Liu Genquan.
    When I walked into his room, he was burying his head, putting a small notebook on his lap and writing characters. I said, "The meeting just ended, aren't you going to rest for a while?" He looked up at me and said, "Our unit is on the front line, and there is too little time for study. Coming to the army to attend a meeting means we have to seize the time to learn a few new characters." After he finished speaking, he buried his head and continued writing. I sat beside him, not wanting to disturb him. Because he had just told me that coming to the army to attend a meeting was like coming to the rear for study. But at this moment, he asked me, "Comrade! Is the character for 'kill' in 'killing the enemy' written like this?" I looked at it and saw that he had written it correctly, so I asked him if he had gone to school at home. He told me that from the time he could carry a manure basket, he had worked as a chore boy in the landlord's house, and poor people couldn't afford to study. In this way, we talked very naturally.
    He is twenty-seven years old this year and very strong, but his face is older than his age. He said, "Don't look at my young age, I also snatched my life from the old society." From this simple sentence, I felt his high political consciousness and deep class feelings. In this way, it is not difficult for us to understand how he became a hero.
    When he was in the People's Liberation Army, he had performed three major meritorious services and had been rated as a model Party member. Before joining the Chinese People's Volunteers, he received a letter from his mother. The letter said: "Genquan, for generations, our family has never had it so good as it does today. Your mother has cried all her life, and now she knows how to smile!" Liu Genquan shed tears as he looked at the letter, and he thought how difficult it was to get to this day. When he heard that the American devils had reached the Yalu River, his heart burned like fire, and he immediately asked his superiors to go to Korea to fight the American devils.
    Last autumn's battle of Fenghuoshan was fought extremely fiercely. The enemy used forty-two tanks, five planes, and two battalions of troops just to attack the artillery position of Liu Genquan's platoon, but this did not frighten our heroes. Liu Genquan said to everyone: "Enemy tanks cannot climb mountains. As long as we have confidence, as long as we build good fortifications and do a good job in air defense, we will annihilate as many enemy infantry as come up." The soldiers also said, "What are we afraid of the enemy? No matter how many baskets of eggs there are, they can't match a stone. They are straw bags, and we are heroes." In this way, the enemy's more than ten charges all retreated in defeat before our heroes. The enemy's corpses were piled up in layers in front of the position.
    Liu Genquan led his platoon of soldiers to fight with stones after their ammunition ran out. Liu Genshuan, the deputy squad leader of the tenth squad, had his leg broken, and an American devil pounced on him, but he pushed him to the ground and bit off the devil's ear with his mouth. Liu Genquan was also wounded, his face covered in blood, but the enemy charged again. He gritted his teeth and struggled to get up, using the first grenade to destroy his own artillery, and then using the last grenade to repel the enemy's last charge.
    These heroic deeds of his were what I learned from interviewing others. When I asked him about it, he just said, "I'm still far behind other heroes. I still have to learn from them." Just as we were talking, comrades from the recording team came to ask him to make a recording. He asked if he could not record it. The comrade said, "Every hero has to be recorded." He said with some embarrassment, "This is more difficult than eliminating a few devils." Indeed, our simple and lovely soldiers are not willing to talk much about their heroic deeds, but their noble qualities and great deeds are all expressed in every moment of their lives, work, and combat.
    There are also countless nameless heroes here, all working and fighting tensely and selflessly. When we see today's happiness and today's victory, we will quickly think of how many people have shed their precious blood and how many people have sacrificed their precious lives for this.
    In a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, I interviewed the sharpshooter Li Fei, and I also went to the front line to interview every soldier in his group. In a mortar bunker, I met Zhang Fengliang, a soldier in Li Fei's group, an eighteen- or nineteen-year-old member of the Communist Youth League. In the battle of Fenghuoshan, Li Fei's group killed or wounded 360 enemies with a high degree of tenacity and wisdom, and held the position without suffering any casualties. This is a glorious battle example on the Korean battlefield. Zhang Fengliang was one of the heroes at that time.
    When the battle was at its most intense, Li Fei called on everyone to hold the gateway to the Kimhwa front. Zhang Fengliang said, "Group leader, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I will definitely complete the task." At that time, he was still a new soldier who had just joined the Chinese People's Volunteers, but in that four-day and four-night blocking battle, he had already been tempered into a heroic young hero.
    When the battle reached the third day, Zhang Fengliang was wounded, and Li Fei comforted him. But Zhang Fengliang said, "Group leader, don't think I'm a new soldier, but I'm a member of the Communist Youth League, what does this little injury matter, I can still fight." In this way, piles of American devils fell in front of his submachine gun.
    He is now a messenger in the company headquarters, often braving enemy fire and completing communication tasks vigilantly. The battalion political instructor boasted to me: "He has a set of mature experiences. He often sneaks around in front of the position, and the enemy just can't hit him."
    There are countless heroes in the front, and the heroes in the rear are also countless. Wherever you go, the leading comrades will first introduce to you how many heroes they have and what moving deeds they have.
    When the cultural troupe of a certain army unit was performing on the front line, an enemy shell hit their stage and injured a female comrade named Yang Yijuan who was dancing. Many people came to rescue her, but she shouted, "I'm fine, go and see the soldiers!" After she was carried to the hospital, the doctor said to her, "The injured eye has gone blind and needs to be removed." She shed tears when she heard this, but she was not regretting the damage to her appearance, but thinking that she would no longer be able to perform for the soldiers. The doctor comforted her and said, "You can still do other work." But she was very passionate about her own artistic work. She suddenly thought that she could still sing to the soldiers. She smiled and said to the doctor without hesitation, "Take it out! Get well soon, I still want to go back to the front line!" Not long ago, she reappeared in the tunnels of the front line, singing new songs for the soldiers.
    Once, I walked along a small mountain road and saw many soldiers opening up a new road on a cliff. There were no rock drilling machines here. The soldiers found abandoned rails from near the positions and made them into chisels to pry open the rocks. They were working tensely and selflessly, with unparalleled creative spirit. An engineer company commander told me: "The superiors required this road to be completed and open to traffic in 45 days, and we plan to complete it in 30 days." A soldier next to him said to me: "Comrade, if the road is opened 15 days early, how many more enemies do you want to kill!" I looked at them, all covered in sweat, but they didn't take a break. The company commander said: "We have to work non-stop. We are now like the air force, calculating time in seconds."
    Walking on the road, I remembered what an infantry company commander had said to me: "Let's just talk about a very small thing. Our cooks have to go up and down the mountain 14 times a day to carry water. It is four miles up and down the mountain once, and the enemy is constantly shelling them. It is not easy to complete such a task. Let's talk about the tunnels. Let's just talk about the one in our company. Such a big project would take one person three years to complete, but we completed it in 40 days. Look at the white marks on the top, they were dug in bit by bit with a pickaxe."
    In Korea, we have many roads opened up from virgin forests, many bridges built with logs one by one, tens of thousands of houses and warehouses, and hundreds of kilometers of communication lines... All of these were created by our soldiers overcoming numerous difficulties. Their achievements are as great and glorious as the achievements of the heroes who bravely killed the enemy.
    Of the countless heroes on the Korean battlefield, some we know their names, but there are also many nameless heroes fighting and working there. They are all soldiers loyal to the motherland, and they are all ordinary and great people.

### 平凡而伟大的人们

    平凡而伟大的人们
    张志民
    在朝鲜前线，我会见了志愿军的许多英雄和功臣，并且和他们在一起工作和战斗过。我曾几次为他们的英雄行为感动得流泪，我真不知道用怎样亲切的称呼才能表达出我对他们的敬爱。
    我所崇敬的人们，他们都是忠于祖国的战士。不论他是个刚刚学会打枪的新战士，或是久经锻炼的老同志，他们在和平事业上都有着辉煌的贡献，有着惊天动地的伟大事迹；每个人的事迹都可写出一部英雄的传记；然而他们自己总觉得是平凡的。当你和他们谈话时，他们首先就极诚恳地对你讲：“我做的还很不够，这一点成绩主要是党和上级的领导、同志们的帮助才能得来的。还要继续努力……。”
    在某军的庆功会上，我访问了英雄刘根全。
    当我走进他的房子时，他正埋着头把小本子放在膝盖上写生字。我说：“刚散会，不休息一会儿吗？”他抬头看了看我说：“我们部队在第一线，学习时间太少，来军里开会得抓紧时间学几个生字啊。”他说完就又埋头写字了。我坐在他的身旁，不愿打扰他。因为他才告诉我说：来到军里开会，就像是来到后方学习一样。可是这时他却问我：“同志！杀敌的‘杀’字是不是这样写呀？”我看了看他写得很对，就问他在家里上过学没有？他告诉我说：他从能背动粪筐的时候起，就给地主家里作小活，书不是穷人能念上的。这样，我们就很自然地谈下去了。
    他今年二十七岁，身体很健壮，但他的面容要比他的年纪苍老些。他说：“别看我年纪不大，也是从旧社会里抢出来的一条命啊。”从这句简单的话里，我感到了他高度的政治觉悟和深厚的阶级感情。这样我们就不难了解他是怎样成为英雄的了。
    他在人民解放军的时候，曾立过三次大功，并且曾被评为模范党员。他在参加志愿军以前曾收到母亲的信。信上说：“根全，几辈子啦，咱家的光景，也没有像今天这么好过，你娘哭了一辈子，如今也知道笑啦！”刘根全看着这封信流了泪，他想到有这么一天是多末不容易。一听说美国鬼子打到了鸭绿江边，他心里就像火烧的一样，他立刻向上级要求到朝鲜去打美国鬼子。
    去年秋天的烽火山的战斗，打得异常激烈。敌人单单为着进攻刘根全他们一个排的炮兵阵地，就使用了四十二辆坦克、五架飞机和两个营的兵力，但这并没有吓倒我们的英雄。刘根全对大家说：“敌人的坦克是不会爬山的，只要咱们有信心，只要咱们做好工事，作好防空工作，敌人步兵上来多少咱们就消灭他多少。”战士们也说：“敌人多怕个啥，鸡蛋有多少筐也碰不过石头。他们是草包，咱们是英雄。”就这样，敌人十多次冲锋都在我们英雄们面前败退下去了。敌人的死尸在阵地面前堆了几层。
    刘根全领导着他这一排的战士们，在弹药打光之后拿起石头打。十班副刘根栓腿被打断了，一个美国鬼子向他扑来，被他推倒在地上，并且用嘴把那鬼子的耳朵咬了下来。刘根全也负了伤，满脸都流着血，但是敌人又一次冲上来了。他咬着牙挣扎起来，用第一个手榴弹把自己的炮炸毁，又用最后的一颗手榴弹打退了敌人最后一次的冲锋。
    他的这些英雄事迹，是我从别人口中访问来的，在我问他时，他只是说：“比人家别的英雄还差得远，还得好好向人家学习。”正谈到这儿，录音组的同志来请他去录音，他问不录行不行？那位同志说：“每个英雄都要录的。”他又挺为难地说：“这比我消灭几个鬼子可难多了。”的确，我们这些朴实可爱的战士们，并不愿意多谈他们的英雄事迹的，但他们的高贵的品质、伟大的事迹，却都表现在他们生活、工作和战斗的每一个时刻里。
    这里还有着数不清的无名英雄，他们都在紧张地忘我地工作着和战斗着。当我们看到今天的幸福，看到今天的胜利时，就会很快联想到有多少人已为此而流下了他们可贵的鲜血，多少人献出了他们宝贵的生命。
    我在志愿军某部访问了神枪手李飞，又到前沿阵地去访问了他的小组的每一个战士。在一个迫击炮掩体里，我会见了李飞小组的一个战士张凤良，这是一个十八九岁的青年团员。李飞小组在烽火山战斗中以高度的顽强和智慧，杀伤敌人三百六十人，坚守了阵地，而自己却无一伤亡。这是朝鲜战场上的光辉战例。张凤良就是当时的英雄之一。
    当战斗到最激烈时，李飞号召大家坚守住这个金城前线的门户。张凤良说：“组长，我是个青年团员，我一定坚决完成任务。”那时他还是个刚刚参加志愿军的新战士，可是就在那四昼夜的阻击战中，他已经锻炼成一个英勇的青年英雄了。
    当战斗到第三天时，张凤良负伤了，李飞就安慰他。可是张凤良却说：“组长，你别看我是个新战士，可是我是个青年团员呀，这点伤算得了什么，我还能打。”就这样，在他的冲锋枪前面，又倒下了一堆堆的美国鬼子。
    他现在在连部当通讯员，经常冒着敌人的炮火，机警地完成通讯的任务。营教导员夸耀地对我说：“他可有一套成熟的经验哩。他经常在阵地前边钻来钻去，敌人就是打不着他。”
    前方有数不尽的英雄，后方的英雄也是难以数计的。你随便到那里去，领导同志都会首先向你介绍他们有多少个英雄，有些什么可歌可泣的事迹。
    当某军文工团在前线演出时，敌人的炮弹打在他们的舞台上，打伤了正在舞蹈的一个名叫杨义娟的女同志。许多人都来抢救她，但是她却喊着：“我不要紧，快去看战士们吧！”当她被抬到医院里以后，医生向她说：“你那只受伤的眼睛已经失明了，须要取出。”她听到这句话落下了泪，但她并不是惋惜自己的面容的损伤，而是在想着自己以后不能再演戏给战士们看了。医生安慰她说：“你还可以做别的工作。”但是她却十分热爱她自己的文艺工作。她忽然想到自己还可以给战士们唱歌，她笑了，她毫不犹豫地对医生说：“取吧！早点治好，我还要回到前线去哩！”不久以前，她已经又出现在前线的坑道里，为战士们演唱新的歌曲了。
    有一次我走过一条小山路，看到有许多战士正在悬崖绝壁上开辟新的公路。这里没有开山机，战士们从阵地附近找出废弃的铁轨，打成钎子来掀石头。他们在忘我地紧张地工作着，他们有着无比的创造精神，一位工兵连长告诉我说：“这条路上级要求四十五天修完通车，我们计划三十天完成它。”旁边一个战士向我说：“同志，早通十五天车，你想要多杀死多少敌人啊！”我望着他们个个都累得满身大汗，可是他们并没有休息一下。这位连长说：“我们要不停地工作，我们现在像空军一样，是以秒来计算时间的。”
    在路上走着，我记起了一位步兵连长曾这样向我说过：“咱就说个很小的事吧，我们的炊事员每天要上山下山背十四回水。上下山一次有四里路，敌人还不断向他们打炮。就是完成这么个任务也不是件容易的事。再说坑道吧，就说我们连的这一条，这么大的工程，要是一个人挖，他得三年才能完成，可是我们四十天就完成了。你瞧那上边的白印，硬是那么一镐镐地掘进去的。”
    在朝鲜，我们有着许许多多从原始森林中开辟出来的道路，有许许多多用一根根木头搭起的桥梁，有多少万间房屋和仓库以及千百公里长的交通线……这都是我们的战士克服重重困难创造出来的。他们的功绩是和英勇杀敌的英雄们的功绩同样伟大而光荣的。
    朝鲜战场上无数的英雄们，有的我们知道他们的名字，但也有许许多多的无名英雄在那里战斗着，工作着。他们都是忠于祖国的战士，都是平凡而伟大的人们。
