    Banning War Cries
    ——An Important Task of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Mei Ru'ao, Member of the World Peace Council
    In the first of the four central topics of the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, there is an item on "Banning War Cries." As a legal professional and a former member of the International War Crimes Tribunal, I would like to particularly point out the importance of this matter for the reference of the representatives attending the conference, and to remind the general peace defenders and all peace-loving people to pay attention.
    I remember that Nazi Germany's top war criminal, Hermann Göring, Hitler's designated successor, said during his trial at the Nuremberg International Tribunal that there were three elements to launching a war: first, military power; second, economic measures; and third, war propaganda. He then said: War propaganda is very important! The judgments of the Nuremberg International Tribunal and the Tokyo International Tribunal confirmed Göring's statement. Both judgments devoted considerable space to describing what war cries and propaganda efforts the Nazi German government and the militarist Japanese government had made before launching their military adventures, to poison and numb the minds of their people, so that they would be mentally and spiritually prepared for the military adventures and wars of aggression that the government was leading them to engage in. This preparation was necessary, because mobilizing the human and material resources of the whole country to engage in war, and driving millions of people to become cannon fodder, could not be done immediately; it required a considerable period of brewing and promotion. War cries and war propaganda are the most powerful tools for brewing and promoting war.
    War cries and war propaganda will inevitably lead to war, just as instigating and encouraging crime will inevitably produce crime; therefore, to prevent crime, it is necessary to punish those who instigate and encourage crime. Similarly, to stop war, it is necessary to punish those who make war cries and engage in war propaganda.
    Although only seven years have passed since the end of World War II, the cries for a new war are now raging again in some countries. This is a very unfortunate and dangerous phenomenon. Here, we must particularly point out the United States, because in the United States, not only are war cries rampant, but it has also become the headquarters of war propaganda worldwide. We only need to open any American bourgeois newspaper to see that a large part of the space is occupied by texts related to war propaganda, some flaunting American military power, some exaggerating American weapons, and the most common is talking about how to fight the Soviet Union, how to attack the Soviet Union, the purpose of course is still nothing more than the so-called "removing the threat of communism" and the so-called "protecting the American way of life." Not only are American newspapers like this, but all American publications, movies, radio, especially "Voice of America," are tirelessly, day and night, making war cries and propaganda there. A widely circulated American magazine, "Collier's," last year published a special issue on "War Against Russia," which contained essays written entirely by American "experts," discussing how to attack and occupy the Soviet Union with land, sea, and air forces, and how to fight the Soviet Union with atomic weapons, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons. The cover of that issue depicted an American soldier in the guise of an "occupying army," holding a large flag, standing proudly in front of the Kremlin gate, with a map of the Soviet Union under his feet. What arrogant, ridiculous, and shameless propaganda this is! Recently, a so-called "Russian Liberation Association" has also been established in the United States, whose purpose is to specialize in slander and vilification against the Soviet Union and to advocate fighting against the Soviet Union, occupying the Soviet Union, and "liberating" the Soviet Union, so that they can "save" those "poor Russians" as soon as possible. How "compassionate" the hearts of the warmongers are!
    From the examples cited above, we can see to what extent war cries and war propaganda have gone mad in the United States! War hysteria is enveloping the entire United States, eroding the hearts of the general American people. This is a terrible phenomenon! The development of this phenomenon will undoubtedly pose a greater threat to peace. Peace defenders all over the world, especially peace defenders in the United States, must find ways to remedy it as soon as possible!
    As a person who studies law, I feel the strangest thing is that since the "Paris Peace Pact" of 1928 declared aggressive war "illegal," and the use of war as a "tool for pursuing national policy" was prohibited by the pact, and the judgments of the Nuremberg and Tokyo International Tribunals have confirmed that it is the "supreme international crime," many countries that pride themselves on being civilized and law-abiding have not yet had any legal sanctions against those who instigate and encourage the commission of this supreme crime. I think this is the most illogical phenomenon in legal theory. In fact, however, those who make war cries and engage in war propaganda can not only get away with impunity, but also receive the favor and reward of American monopoly capitalists, because they are paving the way for aggressive conspiracies and military adventures, and these conspiracies and adventures will bring super profits to this small group of capitalists.
    But the people of the world do not want war. Standing on the side of the people's interests, peace fighters must wage the most resolute struggle against war propaganda. We must strive to promote peace, so that the voice of peace can overwhelm the cries of war. At the same time, we must mobilize the people of all countries to resolutely demand that their legislators and judges use all their powers to prohibit all kinds of war propaganda and punish all kinds of war instigators. To defend peace, this is one of the most important struggles we should wage. I believe that peace fighters in the Asian and Pacific regions, especially our legal professionals, will actively participate in this struggle and do their utmost for this struggle.
    War cries are the prelude to war. To prevent war, we must first ban war cries! (Xinhua News Agency)

    禁止战争叫嚣
    ——亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的一个重要任务
    世界和平理事会理事　梅汝璈
    在即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议四大中心议题的第一议题里，有一项是“禁止关于战争的叫嚣”。作为一个法律工作者和曾经参加过国际战犯审判的一员，我愿特别指出这件事的重要性，以供出席会议代表们的参考，并提醒一般和平保卫者和一切爱好和平人民的注意。
    记得纳粹德国大战犯、希特勒指定的继承人戈林在纽伦堡国际法庭受审时曾经说过：发动战争的要素有三个：一是军事力量，二是经济措施，三是战争宣传。他接着又说：战争宣传的重要性是很大的！纽伦堡国际法庭和东京国际法庭的判决书证实了戈林的说法。那两个判决书都曾费了不少的篇幅来叙述当年纳粹德国政府和军国主义日本政府在发动其军事冒险以前作了些什么战争叫嚣和宣传上的努力，去毒害和麻醉他们人民的思想，使他们在意识上精神上对于政府引导他们去从事的军事冒险和侵略战争有所准备。这种准备是必要的，因为要动员全国的人力物力去从事战争，要驱使百万人民去当炮灰不是立刻可以办到的，它需要相当长期的酝酿和推动。战争叫嚣和战争宣传便是酝酿战争和推动战争最有力的工具。
    战争叫嚣和战争宣传的结果必定会导致战争，犹之乎教唆犯罪和鼓励犯罪必然会产生犯罪一样；因此，要防止犯罪，必须处罚教唆犯罪者和鼓励犯罪者。同样，要制止战争，必须处罚战争叫嚣者和战争宣传者。
    第二次世界大战终结到现在虽仅七年，然而新战争的叫嚣现在在某些国家里又狂热起来了。这是非常不幸而且非常危险的现象。在这里，我们要特别指出的是美国，因为在美国不但战争叫嚣是疯狂地流行着，而且它已经变成了全世界战争宣传的大本营。我们只要打开任何一张美国资产阶级报纸一看，便可以发现有很大部分的篇幅都是登载有关战争宣传的文字，有的是炫耀美国的武力，有的是夸大美国的武器，而最普遍的便是谈论怎样对苏作战，如何进攻苏联，目的当然仍不外乎是所谓“祛除共产主义的威胁”和所谓“保护美国生活方式”。不但美国报纸是如此，一切美国刊物、电影、广播、特别是“美国之音”，都是同样地孜孜不息、夜以继昼地在那里作战争的叫嚣和宣传。一个行销最广的美国杂志——“柯里尔”月刊去年竟出了一期“对苏作战”专号，登载的全是美国“专家们”所撰的论文，讨论怎样以陆海空军进攻苏联，占领苏联，和怎样以原子武器、化学武器、细菌武器去对苏作战。该期封面画的是一个美国大兵以“占领军”的姿态，手执一面大旗，昂然立在克里姆林宫门前，脚下踏的是一张苏联地图。这是多么狂妄可笑而无耻的宣传！最近在美国还成立了一个所谓“俄罗斯解放协会”，宗旨是专门从事进行对苏联的毁谤诬蔑和鼓吹对苏作战、攻占苏联、“解放”苏联，以便他们可以及早“拯救”那些“可怜的俄罗斯人”。战争贩子们的心肠是多么“慈悲”啊！
    从以上所举的例子，我们可以看到在美国战争叫嚣和战争宣传是疯狂得到了怎样的地步！战争歇斯底里正笼罩着美国全土，它在侵蚀着美国一般善良人民的心灵。这是一个可怕的现象！这个现象发展下去，无疑地将构成对和平的更大威胁。全世界的和平保卫者，特别是美国的和平保卫者，必须及早设法，予以挽救！
    作为一个研究法律的人，我感觉最奇怪的便是：侵略战争既为一九二八年“巴黎非战公约”宣布为“非法”，战争且被该公约所禁止使用为“推行国策的工具”，而纽伦堡和东京两个国际法庭的判决又都确定了它是人类的“最大罪行”，但是许多自诩为文明守法的国家对于教唆和鼓动去犯这种最大罪行的人们却到现在还没有任何的法律制裁。我认为这是法理上逻辑上所最说不过去的现象。然而事实上，那些战争叫嚣者和战争宣传者不但可以逍遥法外，而且会受到美国垄断资本家的宠爱和酬劳，因为他们正在为侵略阴谋和军事冒险铺平道路，而这种阴谋和冒险是会给这一小撮资本家带来超额利润的。
    但是全世界人民都是不要战争的。站在人民利益的立场，和平战士们对于战争宣传必须进行最坚决的斗争。我们要努力宣传和平，使和平之声足以压倒战争的叫嚣。同时，我们还要动员各国的人民去坚决要求他们的立法者和司法者运用一切权力，禁止各色各样的战争宣传，并惩罚各种各类的战争煽动者。为了保卫和平，这是我们应该进行的最重要的斗争之一。我相信亚洲和太平洋区域的和平战士们，特别是我们法律工作者，都会积极参加这个斗争，并为了这个斗争尽其最大的努力。
    战争叫嚣是战争的前奏。要防止战争，必先禁止战争的叫嚣！（新华社）
