Point Out the Direction of Striving for Peace to Us
    Liu Hongsheng
    I am an industrialist and businessman. In the past, I managed industry and commerce for more than forty years; now, I still manage several industrial and commercial enterprises; and in the near future, I am still willing to work hard for the proper development of industry and commerce.
    However, in my more than forty years of managing industry and commerce, I have suffered greatly from the disasters of war. The imperialist wars of aggression have caused my motherland and the people of my motherland to suffer many hardships; of course, the industry and commerce that I manage have also been devastated and even on the verge of ruin. I struggled on the edge of destruction, fought in a devastated environment, and the hardships I experienced cannot be described or written down in words, so I hate war! I need peace!
    Not only am I like this, but all Chinese industrialists and businessmen are like this; not only do I hate war and need peace, but all Chinese industrialists and businessmen hate war and need peace; because war means destruction for all legitimate industry and commerce. All legitimate industry and commerce can only survive and develop in peace.
    Not only are Chinese industrialists and businessmen like this, but I think that all general legitimate industrialists and businessmen in Asia, the Pacific region, and even the world are like this, except for a few factory owners who manufacture munitions, or evil merchants who specialize in transporting and selling munitions, who like war and hope to reap benefits from the fires of war, and build their own fortunes on the bloodshed, sacrifice, and family separations of the majority of people.
    Originally, after the Second World War, after the military powers of Germany and Japan were defeated, the people of China, Asia, the Pacific region, and even the world could have obtained the happiness of peace, but a small group of warmongers who made fortunes through war were unwilling to do so and were provoking war everywhere. In Vietnam, in Malaya, and even more obviously in Korea, they violated the legitimate wishes of the local good people for democracy and peace, exerted pressure, and carried out massacres. They even used inhumane bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons, causing significant losses to the lives and property of the local people and to their industrial and commercial enterprises, and also threatening the people of other regions.
    We cannot tolerate this threat. In order to defend our peaceful life and our legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises, we must unite and use our collective strength to fight firmly against this war threat. Either we repel this threat, or we allow this threat to form a larger-scale war to eliminate us.
    The Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference decided to hold the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, the capital of our People's Republic of China, this September, to discuss safeguarding the independence, freedom, and peace of the people of Asia and the Pacific region, opposing the arms race and war preparations, developing equal and mutually beneficial legitimate international economic relations, and opposing blockade and embargo. I think this is necessary and consistent with the wishes of the 1.6 billion people of the Asian and Pacific coastal countries, and therefore unanimously supported by the 1.6 billion people.
    The conference will certainly be able to point out a clearer and more specific direction for us to strive for peace and repel this war threat. All peace-loving people in Asia and the Pacific region will be able to follow this direction, unify our steps, further unite, and guarantee this great victory in striving for peace and repelling the war threat, so that industry and commerce in Asia and the Pacific region can develop in a mutually helpful and mutually beneficial manner in a peaceful environment, and the people of Asia and the Pacific region can live happily in a peaceful environment. As long as everyone works hard, this goal can certainly be achieved. (Xinhua News Agency)

    给我们指出争取和平的方向
    刘鸿生
    我是一个工商业者。在过去我经营了工商业四十多年；在现在，我仍经营着好几个工商企业；在最近的将来，我还是愿意为了工商业的正当发展而努力。
    但是在我四十多年经营工商业的过程中，我是备受战争灾祸的。帝国主义的侵略战争，使我的祖国，我祖国的人民，受到许多苦难；当然我所经营的工商业也随着受尽摧残，甚至濒于毁灭。我在被毁灭的边缘上挣扎着，在被摧残的环境中斗争着，所经历的千辛万苦，不是言语文字所能说得完，写得尽的，所以我痛恨战争！我需要和平！
    不但我如此，一切的中国工商业者也都如此；不但我痛恨战争，需要和平，一切的中国工商业者，都痛恨战争，需要和平；因为战争对于一切正当的工商业，意味着毁灭。一切正当的工商业只有在和平中才能生存，才能发展。
    不但中国的工商业者如此，我想全亚洲、全太平洋区域、乃至全世界的一般正当的工商业者也都如此，除非是少数制造军火的工厂老板，或者是专门运输军火，贩卖军火的罪恶商人，他们才欢喜战争，他们才希望在战争的火中取栗，他们才把自己的发财，建立在大多数人民的流血牺牲，和妻离子散上。
    本来，在第二次世界大战之后，在德国、日本等军国主义势力被打败之后，全中国、全亚洲、全太平洋区域、乃至全世界的人民，是可以获得和平的幸福的，但是靠战争发财的一小撮战争贩子，他们不愿意如此，他们却到处挑拨战争。他们在越南、在马来亚，更显明的是在朝鲜，违反着当地善良人民的民主和平的正当愿望，横加压迫，滥施屠杀。甚至使用灭绝人道的细菌弹和化学武器，使当地人民的生命财产和工商事业受到重大损失，而且还威胁到其他区域的人民。
    我们不能容忍这种威胁，我们为了保卫我们的和平生活，保卫我们的正当工商事业，我们必须团结起来，用大家的力量和这种战争威胁作坚强的斗争。不是我们打退这种威胁，就是让这种威胁，形成范围更大的战争，来消灭我们。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议决定，本年九月在我们中华人民共和国的首都北京，举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，来讨论保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立、自由与和平，反对扩军备战，发展平等互利的正当国际经济关系，反对封锁和禁运，我觉得这是必要的，这是符合于我们亚洲及太平洋沿岸各国十六亿人民的愿望的，因此也是十六亿人民所一致拥护的。
    会议一定能够给我们指出更明确、更具体的争取和平的方向，打退这种战争威胁。全亚洲及太平洋区域爱好和平的人民，一定能够依照这个方向，统一我们的步骤，进一步团结起来，保证这争取和平打退战争威胁的伟大胜利，使全亚洲及太平洋区域的工商业，得在和平的环境中互助互利地发展，使全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民，得在和平的环境中愉快地生活。只要大家努力，这个目的是一定能够达到的。（新华社）
