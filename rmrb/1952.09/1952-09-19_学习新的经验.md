    Learning New Experiences

    After the basic completion of the democratic reform movement in state-owned enterprises nationwide, and on the basis of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the political enthusiasm of the worker masses has soared to unprecedented heights, fiercely plunging into the patriotic movement of increasing production and practicing economy. They work selflessly, wanting to dedicate all their outstanding achievements to the motherland. Therefore, new experiences and creations are constantly emerging, and many old things are being negated. In this situation, if the leading cadres of our enterprises can organize the strength of the masses well and give full play to their wisdom, they can rapidly advance the work of production reform greatly.

    According to reports from various localities, many leading cadres in enterprises are indeed unafraid of difficulties, full of confidence in welcoming new things, going deep into the masses to discover, summarize, and promote the advanced experiences of the masses. In the process, they have also learned a new set of experiences in production management. However, there are also many leading cadres in enterprises who have adopted a retreating attitude towards this complex struggle between new and old ideas. They dare not face new things and lack the vigor that a revolutionary should have. These cadres have a kind of erroneous theory called "not understanding technology, lacking confidence."

    Indeed, the main content of advanced experience is to improve technology and working methods. However, for a leading cadre of an enterprise, no one will demand that they understand all the technical details in the same way as they would expect of an engineer or technician. The important task of enterprise leaders is how to mobilize and organize various forces to complete and exceed the state's tasks by 100%. Of course, learning technology is also necessary. If you are not afraid of setbacks and maintain a humble learning attitude, this problem is not difficult to solve.

    How should enterprise leaders carry out their work? The most important thing is to conduct in-depth and meticulous research into the situation, determine work arrangements, conduct inspections at any time, make timely summaries, and value and widely promote advanced methods among the masses. Most of our enterprise leaders are relatively familiar with leading political movements and have a set of methods for mobilizing the masses, such as holding meetings, mobilizing, reporting, and issuing calls. These methods have played a great role in the past and will continue to play a role in the future. However, if the work of promoting advanced experience is only limited to holding meetings and mobilizing, and dreaming that everything will be fine after a burst of activity, then it will definitely fail. Some factories and mines have superficially promoted advanced experiences by 100%, but after an in-depth inspection, only 10% have truly implemented them. How astonishing is this difference! This cannot be blamed on "not understanding technology."

    Promoting advanced experience is a new task, and leadership methods must also abandon the old ways and arduously learn new experiences. Otherwise, this task cannot be completed well, nor can one transform oneself from being ignorant to knowledgeable. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must overcome difficulties, we must learn what we do not understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully, learn honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. Don't put on bureaucratic airs. Delve into it, a few months, a year or two, three or five years, and you can always learn it." Cadres who have erroneous ideas about new things have not truly understood the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions.

    Today, the whole country is facing the task of large-scale economic construction. The leading cadres of various enterprises must step up their learning and improve their work. Otherwise, not only will the movement to increase production and practice economy not be fully developed, and not be able to create more wealth for the country, but even more seriously, they will also not be able to accumulate the experience in production management that is essential for the period of large-scale economic construction, and will inevitably lead to greater difficulties in the future. This is something that every enterprise leader must be very vigilant about.

    学习新的经验
    在全国国营企业的民主改革运动基本结束以后，在“三反”“五反”胜利的基础上，工人群众的政治热情空前高涨，猛烈地卷入了爱国增产节约的浪潮中。他们忘我地劳动，要把一切优异的成就献给祖国，因而新的经验和创造不断出现，许多旧的东西被否定了。在这种情况下，我们各企业的领导干部，如果能很好地组织群众的力量，尽量发挥他们的智慧，就可以迅速地将生产改革工作大大推进一步。
    根据各地的反映，许多企业中的领导干部确是不畏困难，充满着信心迎接新事物，深入到群众中去，发现、总结、推广群众的先进经验。在这中间，他们也学会了一套新的生产管理的经验。但是，也有不少企业的领导干部，对于这个新旧思想的复杂斗争，采取了退缩不前的态度。他们不敢面对新事物，缺乏一个革命者应有的朝气。这些干部有种错误的理论，叫做“不懂技术，缺乏信心。”
    的确，先进经验的主要内容就是提高技术和改进工作方法。但是，对于一个企业的领导干部来说，谁也不会像对待工程师或技师一样，要求他们去懂得技术上的一切枝节问题。企业领导干部的重要任务，乃在于如何发动和组织各种力量，百分之百地完成和超过国家的任务。当然，学习技术也是必要的。如果不怕碰钉子，抱着虚心学习的态度，这个问题也不难解决。
    企业领导干部应该如何进行自己的工作呢？最主要的就是要深入细致的研究情况，确定工作部署，随时进行检查，及时作出总结，重视并广泛推行群众中的先进方法。我们大多数企业领导干部，都是比较熟习领导政治运动的，有一套开会、动员、报告、号召等发动群众的方法，这些方法在过去起了很大的作用，今后也还要起作用。但是，如果把推广先进经验的工作仅仅停留在开会、动员上，幻想轰一下后就万事大吉，那就一定要失败。有些厂、矿表面上是百分之百地推广了先进经验，但是深入一检查，只有百分之十，这个差数是何等的惊人！这决不能把责任推之于“不懂技术”。
    推广先进经验是一个新的工作，领导方法也必须抛掉旧的一套，艰苦地学习新的经验，否则，就不能很好完成这一任务，也不能使自己由不懂变成懂。毛主席教导我们：“我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂，不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”对待新事物有着错误思想的干部，是没有真正体会毛主席这些指示的精神。
    今天，全国正面临着大规模经济建设的任务，各企业的领导干部，必须加紧学习，改进工作，否则，不但增产节约运动不能全面开展，不能为国家创造更多的财富，更严重的是也将不能积累起来为大规模经济建设时期必不可少的生产管理的经验，将来必然招致更大的困难。这是每个企业的领导干部必须十分警惕的事。
