Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch from Sydney: People in various regions and organizations of Australia are actively selecting delegates to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    The Peace Committee of New South Wales, Australia, has established a committee of twenty-five people to carry out the work of selecting delegates in New South Wales. The Sally Hills suburb Peace Committee has held a meeting to select prominent local peace activists as delegates. Women's organizations throughout Australia held a joint meeting in Sydney, at which it was decided to elect a female representative to attend the peace conference. The Student Representative Council of the University of Melbourne has elected one representative. The Central Council of the Australian Miners' Federation has also decided to send one representative to the peace conference. In addition, the Metal Trades Federation, the South Bulli Miners' Association, and miners in the north have all decided to elect representatives to attend the peace conference. The National Launching Committee for the selection of Australian representatives to the peace conference is in the process of determining the list of representatives. At the same time, the Australian Pacific Peace Committee has launched a campaign to raise travel expenses for delegates attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and the Waratah region of Newcastle has been the first to respond to this call.

    The Australian delegates who attended the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference are introducing the situation of the preparatory meeting to people in various places. In early August, many gatherings were held in various suburbs of Sydney, and these gatherings all passed resolutions supporting the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Reverend Van Eerde, Broomham, and Geitzelt, the Australian delegates who attended the Beijing preparatory meeting, delivered speeches at a gathering in Banksdown, which was convened by the South Banksdown branch of the Australian Labor Party. Bolton, the chief Australian delegate to the preparatory meeting, gave a report in Hurstville and answered questions from the audience. Bolton is now traveling throughout Australia, promoting the importance of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and has been welcomed by the broad masses of people. At a gathering in Brisbane, there were three to four thousand listeners. At a gathering of workers at the Benalong Power Station in Sydney, Australia's largest power station, the police used procedural excuses to obstruct Bolton's speech, resulting in hundreds of workers going on strike to protest. The South Coast Labor Council also supported Bolton and decided to distribute leaflets in regional unions promoting the peace conference. At these meetings, Bolton said: It would be a crime to prevent Australia from having representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. He also said: Our country must have an independent foreign policy and not rely on any country. We are a Western nation living in Asia, and we cannot hope that Australia's future depends on the fleets of the United States and Britain, or on treaties or understandings with these countries, but must establish relations with Asia on the basis of permanent understanding and cooperation. If Australia continues its current policy, it will certainly suffer the same failures as the United States has suffered in China and Korea. At a mass gathering in Brisbane, Reverend Van Eerde said: Most people hate war, and our task is to unite all peace-loving people to make war impossible.

    Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: New Zealand's "People's Voice" newspaper carried a message stating that the New Zealand Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has recently selected representatives to attend the conference.

    New Zealand peace activists are widely promoting the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. Aikichi, the New Zealand delegate who attended the preparatory meeting held in Beijing in June, told reporters from the "People's Voice" after returning to China, hoping that New Zealand would send a broadly representative delegation to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. He said: This conference will not only "discuss peace issues, but also open the eyes of New Zealanders." When talking about the achievements of New China, he said: The new Chinese government is strong because it fully represents the people's desire for peace. Aikichi gave speeches at a meeting hosted by the Lower Hutt Peace Committee on August 4th and at a mass meeting in Hastings on August 11th. He said: China's production has made leaping progress, and it not only no longer imports grain, but also has surplus grain for export. China is now able to manufacture many machines, including electrical and scientific equipment.

    New Zealand peace activist Bishop Chandler emphasized the importance of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference at a warm gathering held by the Auckland China Friendship Association. He believes that this is an opportunity to discuss common issues with brothers from other countries, and that this conference will make a great contribution to the happiness and peace of people all over the world. Bishop Chandler also talked about the importance of peace and friendship with the Chinese people to the New Zealand people, and emphasized the need for people of all countries to maintain peaceful and friendly relations.

    迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    澳新两国人民积极推选出席代表加紧宣传
    【新华社一日讯】悉尼消息：澳大利亚各地、各团体正在积极推选代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。
    澳大利亚新南威尔士州的和平委员会已成立了一个由二十五人组成的委员会，进行在南威尔士州选派代表的工作。萨利山东郊区和平委员会已开会选定当地著名和平人士为代表。全澳大利亚的妇女组织在悉尼召开了联席会议，会上决定推选一名妇女代表出席和平会议。墨尔本大学学生代表会议已选出代表一人。澳大利亚矿工联合会中央理事会也决定派代表一人出席和平会议。此外，金属业工会联合会、南巴莱矿工联谊会和北方的矿工都决定选派代表出席和平会议。澳大利亚选派出席和平会议代表的全国发起委员会正在确定代表人选。同时，澳大利亚太平洋和平委员会已发动为出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表募集旅费的运动，纽卡斯尔的瓦隆岗地区已首先响应了这个号召。
    出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的澳大利亚代表正向各地人民介绍筹备会议的情况。八月上旬，悉尼各郊区举行了许多集会，这些集会会议都通过了拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的决议。出席北京筹备会议的澳大利亚代表范·伊尔德牧师、布龙汉和吉策尔特三人曾在班克斯唐区的集会上发表了演说，这个会议是由澳大利亚工党南班克斯唐区支部所召集的。出席筹备会议的澳大利亚首席代表博尔顿在赫斯特维尔区作了报告，并回答了听众提出的问题。博尔顿现在澳大利亚各地旅行，宣传亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重要性，获得了广大群众的欢迎。在勃里斯朋的集会上，听众有三、四千人。在澳大利亚最大的电力站悉尼的本纳龙电力站的工人的集会上，警察曾用手续上的藉口阻挠博尔顿的讲话，结果数百工人实行罢工表示抗议。南海岸劳工委员会也支持博尔顿，并决定在地区工会中散发赞助和平会议的传单。博尔顿在这些会议上说：澳大利亚必须有代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，要阻止它将是一种罪行。他又说：我国必须有独立的外交政策，而不依赖任何国家。我们是居住在亚洲的西方民族，我们不能希望澳大利亚的前途依靠美英的舰队，或依靠和这些国家订立的条约或谅解，而必须在永久谅解和合作的基础上，与亚洲建立关系。如果澳大利亚继续现行的政策，一定会遭到像美国在中国和朝鲜所遭到的失败。在勃里斯朋的群众集会上，范·伊尔德牧师说：大多数的人民憎恨战争，我们的任务是团结所有爱好和平的人民，使战争成为不可能。
    【新华社一日讯】新西兰“人民之声”报刊载消息称：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议新西兰筹备委员会最近已选出参加会议的代表。

    新西兰和平人士张德勒主教在奥克兰中国友好协会召开的一个热烈的集会上，强调指出亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重要性。他认为这是和其他国家的兄弟们讨论共同问题的一个机会，这个会议将对世界各国人民的幸福与和平有巨大贡献。张德勒主教还谈到和平及和中国人民友好对新西兰人民的重要性，并强调主张各国人民保持和平友好关系。
