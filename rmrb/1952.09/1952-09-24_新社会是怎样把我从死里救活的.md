How the New Society Saved Me from Death

To the Editor:

I am a worker from the Second Loading and Unloading Team of the Yongdingmen District of the Beijing Transportation Company. I am writing this letter to let everyone know how the new society saved me from death.

In June of this year, I was careless while working and was hit in the waist by a large log. At that moment, everything went black, and I thought: this is the end of the road, even if I don't die from this, I'll starve to death. But things didn't turn out as I expected. Immediately, our own hospital—the搬运工人hospital—sent an ambulance and took me to the hospital. The nurses treated me like a family member, washing my body and changing my clothes. Even though their snow-white uniforms were covered in my blood, dirt, and sweat, they didn't mind at all and comforted me. After the doctor examined me, it was found that I had fractured three sections of my lumbar spine and one rib. Because of the limitations of equipment and technical conditions, the hospital transferred me to Peking University Hospital for treatment. The doctors and nurses at Peking University Hospital also took very good care of me and were very responsible in their treatment. In thirty days, my condition improved, and I was transferred back to the Workers' Hospital for recuperation. The nurses here fed me, washed my face, and bathed me all day long... They were truly meticulous, even better than my own family. The union committee member, the loading and unloading team leader, and my comrades from the same team often came to see me, bringing many snacks and fruits each time.

I spent about three months in the hospital, and the cost was no less than seven or eight million yuan, which is enough for me to earn for a lifetime. The union not only paid for this expense but also took care of my family's livelihood every month, so my family and two children didn't have to worry.

I have been working as a porter since I was sixteen years old. This year, I am thirty-two years old, having worked for sixteen years. I never thought I would have such a good life today. When working for the Kuomintang and the puppet regime, getting a few pounds of bean cake flour that even pigs wouldn't eat after working for ten days or half a month was considered good. If you weren't careful, you would be beaten with fists and boots. If you got injured while working, it was a dead end. I have personally seen many injured partners lying on stretchers wandering the streets, and no hospital would take them in. Ji Gongming and Xue Delu, who worked with me, injured their legs while carrying salt bags. They sold their bedding but still couldn't afford treatment, and in the end... let's not even mention it! Why can I receive such care today? This is given to me by Chairman Mao because Chairman Mao led our working class to turn over a new leaf.

For the past three months, I have been lying in bed thinking, the new society has saved me from death. How should I repay Chairman Mao's kindness? Although I can't do heavy work anymore, I will never lose heart. I will do my best to take on the work that I can handle. With the encouragement and help of the leadership, I have begun to study culture diligently. I studied for two or three years when I was young. Now, I can learn twenty or thirty new characters every day, and it is not difficult to read the People's Daily and the "Beijing Worker." I guarantee that I will continue to study hard after I am discharged from the hospital, respond to all the government's calls, and be a good worker to repay the happiness that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought to the working class.

### 新社会是怎样把我从死里救活的

    新社会是怎样把我从死里救活的
    编辑同志：我是北京市运输公司永定门区装卸第二中队的工人。我写这封信，是想让大伙知道：新社会是怎样把我从死里往活处救的。
    今年六月间，我干活时不小心，给一根大圆木砸中腰部。当时，我眼前一阵黑，心想：这下子该活到头了，砸不死也得饿死。但是，事情不是像我想的那样。马上，我们自己的医院——搬运工人医院开来了救急车，把我接到医院。女护士像对待亲人一样给我擦洗身体、换衣服。虽然我身上的鲜血、灰土和汗水沾满了她们雪白的工作服，她们不但不嫌弃，还安慰我。经过大夫检验，发现我腰脊骨折了三截，肋条骨折了一根，医院因为设备和技术条件的限制，就把我转送北大医院去治疗。北大医院的大夫和护士对我也是照顾得非常周到，治疗很负责任。三十天的功夫，我的病就见好了，我又转回到工人医院来休养。这里的护士整日给我喂饭、洗脸、擦澡……真是无微不至，比家里的人还强。工会委员、装卸中队长和我同一小队的同志们，经常来看我，每次都送来许多点心和水果。
    我住院三个月左右，花的钱已经不下七、八百万元，够我挣一辈子。工会不但负责支付这笔费用，而且每月还照顾我家属的生活，使家里人和两个娃娃的日子也用不着我操心。
    我从十六岁就扛活，今年是三十二岁，前后扛了十六年，再也没有想到会有今天这样的好日子。给国民党和敌伪干活时，干了十天半个月能拿到几斤猪都不吃的豆饼面还算是好的，弄不好还得挨拳头和马靴。干活受了伤就是死路一条。我亲眼看见过多少受伤的伙伴，躺在担架上满街转，没有一个医院肯收留他。和我一道干活的纪功明和薛得禄因抬盐包把腿碰伤了，卖了被窝还没有治好，最后……就甭提了！为什么今天我能得到这样的照顾呢？这是毛主席给我的，因为毛主席领导我们工人阶级翻了身。
    三个月来，我一直躺在床上想，新社会把我从死里救活了，我应该怎样来报答毛主席的恩情呢？虽然今后我不能再干重活了，但是我决不灰心，我要尽我的能力，担当起我所能担当的一份工作。在上级的鼓励和帮助下，我已开始努力学习文化。我小时念过二、三年书，现在每天能学会二、三十个生字，看人民日报和“北京工人”已经没有多大困难了。我保证出院后继续努力学习，响应政府一切号召，做一个好工人，来报答共产党毛主席给工人阶级带来的幸福。
