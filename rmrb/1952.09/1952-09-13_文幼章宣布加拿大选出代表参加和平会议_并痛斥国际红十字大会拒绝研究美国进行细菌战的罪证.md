Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 12th: The "Canadian Tribune" reported on the 8th that Dr. Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, announced at a peace picnic youth gathering held in the suburbs of Toronto on August 31st that Canada has selected representatives to attend the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. The Canadian Peace Congress is assisting the Canadian Preparatory Committee in raising funds for the delegation to attend the conference. Peace advocates distributed peace signature books and donation slips among the more than two thousand people who attended the picnic.

Dr. Wen Youzhang also advocated sending "a large Canadian delegation representing people with various opinions on peace issues to the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna on December 5th."

Referring to the recent refusal of the leaders of the International Red Cross Conference to study the bacteriological warfare evidence brought to Toronto by the Chinese and Korean delegations, Dr. Wen Youzhang said: "Those of us who believe in the truth of these accusations believe that they are completely accurate. The fact that the Americans are conducting bacteriological warfare is a fact that everyone has heard and seen." He called for redoubled efforts to ensure that all countries ratify the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting bacteriological warfare. He welcomed all Canadian peace groups attending the picnic, and especially mentioned that the peace movement within the Presbyterian Church in Canada has been growing stronger, and the trade union movement in the semi-war economy is increasingly recognizing that war work cannot bring prosperity and security.

On the same day, the "Canadian Tribune" published an editorial condemning the American atrocities of cruelly killing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and bombing peaceful cities and civilians in Korea. The editorial column featured a photograph of a grieving mother holding a dead child, surrounded by the rubble of destroyed homes. The editorial demanded that Canada show conscience regarding these terrible American atrocities.

    文幼章宣布加拿大选出代表参加和平会议
    并痛斥国际红十字大会拒绝研究美国进行细菌战的罪证
    【新华社布拉格十二日电】“加拿大论坛报”八日报道：加拿大和平大会主席文幼章博士八月三十一日在多伦多郊区举行的和平野餐青年联欢会上宣布：加拿大已选出代表出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，加拿大和平大会正在协助加拿大筹备委员会为代表团募捐出席会议的费用。和平拥护者在参加野餐的两千多群众中间散发和平签名书和捐款单。
    文幼章博士还主张派遣“代表在和平问题上抱各种不同意见的人们的庞大的加拿大代表团出席将于十二月五日在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会”。
    文幼章博士在谈到最近国际红十字大会的负责人拒绝研究中国和朝鲜代表团带到多伦多来的细菌战证据时说：“我们相信这些控诉的真实性的人认为其中一字不多，一字不假。美国人进行细菌战是大家有耳共闻、有目共睹的事实。”他号召加倍努力使一切国家都批准禁止细菌战的一九二五年日内瓦议定书。他对所有来参加这次野餐的加拿大和平团体表示欢迎，并特别提到，加拿大长老会中的和平运动已日益壮大，半战争性经济中的工会运动愈来愈认识到战争工作不能带来繁荣和安全。
    同一天的“加拿大论坛报”发表社论，斥责美国残酷杀戮朝中战俘与轰炸朝鲜和平城市和平民的暴行。社论栏内刊有一幅照片，内容是一个痛苦万状的母亲抱着一个死了的孩子，四周是被炸毁的住屋的瓦砾。社论要求加拿大对美国人的这些可怕暴行拿出良心来。
