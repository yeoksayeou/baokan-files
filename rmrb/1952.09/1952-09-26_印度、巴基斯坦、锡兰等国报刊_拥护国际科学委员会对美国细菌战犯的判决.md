Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, September 25th. Many newspapers in India, Pakistan, and Ceylon published news of the findings of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China" and believe that the commission's conclusions are truthful.

The Bengali daily "Azad" published a commentary on September 17th on this matter, stating: "Arrogant warmongers have attempted to eliminate everything true and noble in the world. The findings of the International Scientific Commission have once again exposed the hateful lies of the American rulers."

“From the very beginning, the American aggression in Korea has been based on lies and inhuman barbarism. The American illegal resolution that slandered North Korea as the aggressor and stole the name of the United Nations, the germ warfare that violated the Geneva Protocol, the prolonged armistice in violation of international law on prisoners of war – a series of monstrous crimes are emerging one after another.”

The Urdu daily "Nawa-i-Waqt" published in Gujranwala on September 18th, wrote an article entitled "Another Verdict on American Barbarians": "The International Scientific Commission that conducted this investigation is completely neutral, a fact that even American barbarians cannot deny. The neutrality, impartiality, and intellectual capabilities of each member of the commission are beyond question. The commission not only spoke with the American Air Force pilots who dropped these germ bombs, but also saw the insects infected with bacteria. They reached their conclusions after conducting scientific investigations. They announced that the American side should bear full responsibility for the bacteriological warfare against China and Korea. This is a unanimous verdict.

"The accusations against the American barbarians have been confirmed. The neutral court has rendered its verdict: these barbarians are the enemies of mankind. Their own people have confessed. Under these circumstances, all righteous people in the world have a responsibility to strongly denounce this barbaric act."

    印度、巴基斯坦、锡兰等国报刊
    拥护国际科学委员会对美国细菌战犯的判决
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰的许多报纸刊载了“调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会”的调查结果的消息，并认为委员会的结论是真实的。
    孟加拉文日报“自由报”在九月十七日就此事发表评论说：“傲慢的战争贩子曾企图消灭世界上一切真实的和高贵的东西。国际科学委员会的调查结果又一次揭穿了美国统治者的令人憎恨的谎言。
    “从一开始时起，美国在朝鲜进行的侵略就是以谎言和惨无人性的野蛮行为为基础的。诬蔑北朝鲜为侵略者并盗窃联合国名义的美国非法决议、破坏日内瓦议定书的细菌战、违反关于战俘问题的国际法而延不停战——累累的滔天罪行正在层出不穷。”
    在朱龙多城出版的乌尔都文日报“新世纪”，九月十八日以“对美国野蛮人的又一个判决”为题写道：“这次进行调查的国际科学委员会是完全中立的，这个事实连美国野蛮人也无法否认。委员会的每个成员的中立性、公正无私和智力才能都是不成问题的。委员会不仅和投掷这些细菌弹的美国空军驾驶员谈了话，而且还看到了感染了细菌的昆虫。他们是在进行了科学的调查之后，得出了他们的结论的。他们宣布：对中国与朝鲜进行细菌战的全部责任应该由美方负担。这是全体一致的判定。
    “对美国野蛮人的指责已经证实。中立的法庭已经作出判决：这些野蛮人是人类的公敌。他们自己方面的人已经认罪。在这种情况下，全世界一切正直的人们有责任大力声讨这种野蛮主义的行径。”
