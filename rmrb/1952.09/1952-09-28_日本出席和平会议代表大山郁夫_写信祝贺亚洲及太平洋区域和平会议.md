(Xinhua News Agency, September 27th) Oyama Ikuo, the Japanese delegate to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and recipient of the Stalin International Peace Prize, wrote a letter from Japan on September 18th to congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The full text of Oyama Ikuo's congratulatory letter is as follows:

Dear comrades in the Asian and Pacific regions!

On the eve of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, I extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you who are fighting for peace. I would like to first report on the circumstances surrounding the delegates' conference to elect representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and the Peace Festival commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Japanese Communist Party, which was recently held in Tokyo, as well as the ardent desire for peace shown by the Japanese people in these two gatherings.

　　The former gathering was attended by more than five hundred representatives elected by millions of people from all over the country; the latter was a peace gathering directly attended by approximately eighty thousand people. When these two gatherings were still in the planning stages, they became the object of serious vigilance, brutal suppression, and obstruction by the ruling class, and encountered various other difficulties. However, once unveiled, the success of these two gatherings far exceeded our expectations. For example, the two-day delegates' conference to elect representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was attended by representatives from all over Japan, from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. The reports on the situations in various regions brought by these representatives all indicated how they were supported by the broad masses of the Japanese people in attending this conference. These representatives included candidates recommended by various groups as representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. Some of these candidates, such as the representative from Shizuoka City, represented 100% of the people from all walks of life in the city and were recommended and supported by people from all walks of life. The recommendation signature book for this representative candidate was filled with the names of representatives from all walks of life, from the mayor representing the conservative forces to the Communist Party Committee of the city. The same situation could be seen in Ota Ward, Tokyo, where the head of Ota Ward, belonging to the Liberal Party, and the Communist Party Committee of the ward unanimously recommended the same candidate. These facts illustrate that the movement in support of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference has shattered the unreasonable obstruction of the Yoshida government and has received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the Japanese people.

　　The other gathering was the Peace Festival commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party, attended by eighty thousand people. This gathering, due to the obstruction of the Yoshida government, did not have a venue determined until three days before it was held. Considering this point, it can be said that this gathering was an astonishing success. This proves that regardless of the desperate malicious propaganda and slander against the Japanese Communist Party by various parties from the Liberal Party to the Left-wing Socialist Party, the Japanese masses still place deep trust in the Japanese Communist Party, the party that defends peace. At these two gatherings, the calls of the World Peace Council and the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to the Japanese people gave all the participants a profound impression, and both gatherings were filled with a warm atmosphere of international solidarity from beginning to end. These two gatherings indicate that just as the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is being convened, the peace movement in Japan is about to enter a new period of development.

　　One reason for the emergence of this situation is that the U.S. military has formally ended its occupation, giving the Japanese people the opportunity to reflect on and criticize the past war with a sharp eye, especially the massacres carried out with atomic bombs. This is a phenomenon that we cannot ignore. Needless to say, the so-called end of the occupation is entirely formal and has no substantive content, but despite this, it still cannot prevent the Japanese people from demanding a serious reconsideration of Japan's relationship with the United States. Under this demand, the Japanese people are first striving to re-examine the great tragedy of the Japanese people that occurred in Hiroshima seven years ago. Precisely because of this, a collection of photographs related to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, published by a certain publishing house, aroused a strong reaction, and hundreds of thousands of copies were sold out within ten days. This sentiment, which has risen among the Japanese people, has been further increased by reports on the brutal acts of the U.S. military in the Korean battlefield, reports on the heinous germ warfare, and reports on the indiscriminate bombing of Korean cities. The broad masses have clearly realized that what the U.S. military has brought to Asia is not peace and order, but war and destruction. This understanding is reflected on the one hand in the demand of "U.S. troops get out" raised during the "May Day" Labor Day this year; on the other hand, it is reflected in the rapid strengthening of the awareness of solidarity between the Japanese people and the various ethnic groups in Asia. Of course, contributing to this situation since the beginning of this year, there have also been Premier Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people, the International Economic Conference held in Moscow in April, the Sino-Japanese trade agreement on June 1st, and the achievements of the Preparatory Meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, etc. Every call from the world peace camp to the Japanese people has a power that deeply touches the hearts of the Japanese people, and sufficient attention should be paid to these facts.

　　These calls have strengthened the Japanese people's belief that two different systems can coexist peacefully, and in particular have made the Japanese people turn the demand for Japan-Soviet trade and Japan-China trade into an urgent task. The fact that many industrialists and businessmen from all over the country are among the aforementioned candidates for representatives to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference fully proves this point. They are participating in this movement from the standpoint of capitalists, and are enthusiastically demanding peaceful and free trade with China and the Soviet Union.

　　The characteristic of the Japanese peace movement at the present stage lies here. The demands for defending peace and national liberation have thus converged into a torrent, and the peace movement in Japan has developed forward as an inseparable part of the national liberation democratic front.

　　This is what I, who have been engaged in the peace movement for more than thirty years and have personally participated in the torrent of this struggle, am now seeing with particularly deep emotion.

　　Here, I only report a part of the situation, and I hope that all the peace fighters in the Asian and Pacific regions will continue to give enthusiastic assistance to the peace movement in Japan in the future.

　　Oyama Ikuo

### 日本出席和平会议代表大山郁夫  写信祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议

    日本出席和平会议代表大山郁夫
    写信祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社二十七日讯】亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议日本代表、斯大林国际和平奖金得奖人大山郁夫，于九月十八日自日本写信祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。大山郁夫的贺信全文如下：亲爱的亚洲及太平洋区域的同志们！
    当此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开的前夕，我对正在为和平而斗争着的各位，致衷心的敬礼。我想首先报告一下最近在东京举行的推选亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表大会和纪念日本共产党成立三十周年的和平节的情况，以及在这两个集会里所表现出来的日本人民对和平的迫切愿望。
    前一个集会有全国各地几百万群众选出来的五百多名代表参加；后者是一个约有八万群众直接参加的和平集会。当这两个集会还在纸上计划的时候，就已成为统治阶级严重警戒、残酷镇压和阻挠的对象，并遭到了其他种种困难。但是，一旦揭幕，这两个集会成功的程度则远远超过了我们的预料。例如，为期两天的推选亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表大会，有北自北海道、南至九州的日本全国各地的代表们参加，这些代表们所带来的关于各地情况的报告，都表明了他们怎样受到日本广大阶层人民的支持而参加这次大会。这些代表们包括各种团体所推荐的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表候选人。其中有些候选人，如静冈市的代表，百分之百地代表了全市各阶层人民，并且受到各阶层人民的推荐和支持。这位代表候选人的推荐人签名簿上写满了自代表保守势力的市长到该市共产党委员会的各界代表的名字。在东京太田区也可以看到同样的情形，自属于自由党的太田区区长直到该区共产党委员会，一致推选同一个候选人。这些事实说明：拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的运动粉碎了吉田政府的无理阻挠，受到了日本广大阶层人民的热烈支持。
    另一个是有八万群众参加的纪念共产党成立三十周年的和平节。这一集会，由于吉田政府的阻难，直到开会前三天才决定了会场。如果把这一点考虑在内，那么可以说这个集会实在是惊人的成功。这件事证明：不管从自由党到左派社会党的各个党派拚命进行对日本共产党的恶意宣传和谩骂，日本群众仍然对保卫和平的政党——日本共产党寄予深切的信赖。在这两个集会上，世界和平理事会和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议对日本人民的号召给了全体与会群众以深刻的铭感，两次集会自始至终充满了热烈的国际团结的气氛。这两个集会表示：正和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开的同时，日本的和平运动即将进入一个新的发展时期。
    产生这种形势的一个原因，就是美军在形式上结束了占领，日本人民有机会以尖锐的眼光来反省和批判过去的战争，特别是以原子弹进行的大批屠杀。这是我们所不能忽视的现象。不用说，所谓占领的结束完全是形式的，没有什么实质内容，但是，尽管如此，这仍然不能阻碍日本人民要求重新认真考虑日本与美国的关系。在这种要求之下，日本人民首先努力重新正视七年前在广岛所发生的日本人民的一大悲剧。正因为如此，某一出版社所刊行的有关广岛、长崎遭受原子弹轰炸的照片集引起强烈反应，不出旬日就售完了几十万份。在日本人民中间高涨起来了的这种情绪，由于有关美军在朝鲜战场的残暴行为的报告、有关凶恶的细菌弹的报告和有关对朝鲜各城市所进行的狂轰滥炸的报告，而更加增涨，广大群众已经清楚地认识到，美军带到亚洲来的并不是和平与秩序，而是战争和破坏。这种认识一方面表现在今年“五一”劳动节时提出来的“美国军队滚回去”的要求上面；另一方面表现在日本人民中间关于日本与亚洲各民族团结的意识在迅速加强上面。当然，促成这种情况的，自今年年初以来，还有苏联部长会议主席斯大林对日本人民的新年贺电、四月里在莫斯科召开的国际经济会议、六月一日的中日贸易协议、以及亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的成就等等。这些从世界和平阵营向日本人民发出的每一个号召，都具有深深打动日本人民心怀的力量，对于这些事实，应该给予足够的重视。
    这些号召使日本人民加强了两个不同的制度可以和平共存的信念，特别使日本人民把要求进行日苏贸易及日中贸易，变成紧急任务，上述亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议代表候选人里面，有全国各地的许多工商业家这一事实，就充分地证明了这一点。他们是以资本家的立场，热烈要求与中国及苏联和平及自由贸易而参加这次运动的。
    现阶段日本和平运动的特点，就在这里。保卫和平与民族解放的要求，就这样汇成了一股洪流，和平运动在日本已成了民族解放民主战线的不可分割的一部分而向前发展着。
    这就是从事和平运动三十余年，亲身参加到这个斗争的洪流里的我，现在特别怀着深为感动的心情所看到的情景。
    在这里，仅报告一部分情况，并希望亚洲及太平洋区域所有的和平战士们，今后继续给日本的和平运动以热烈的援助。
    大山郁夫
