Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, September 6th:  In view of the growing hatred of the Japanese people for the reactionary and corrupt Liberal Party, and the emergency situation caused by the forced announcement of early elections by the Yoshida traitorous government, the American occupiers are using despicable means to support militarists from various reactionary parties, led by Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru and others, to participate in the election. This is so that, should the Liberal Party's Yoshida group lose in the election, they can replace the latter to organize a so-called rearmament cabinet.

The Yoshida government is an instrument of aggression fostered by the American occupiers. Especially after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, the United States especially hoped that the Yoshida government would come forward alone to engage in large-scale rearmament, suppress the Japanese people's peaceful and democratic movement, and enable the American occupiers to hide safely behind the scenes, pretending to respect Japan's "independence," and ease the Japanese people's anti-American sentiment, so as to consolidate American control over Japan. However, the increasingly high tide of the Japanese people's movement to strive for peace, independence, and democracy has forced the Yoshida government to fail to complete the plan for large-scale rearmament according to the wishes of its American masters, and finally forced the Yoshida government to dissolve the Liberal Party-dominated Diet ahead of schedule. This situation has greatly alarmed the American occupiers. Therefore, the American occupiers are instructing another small group of notorious militarists to actively participate in the election, so that they can be used to replace the Yoshida government when necessary.

It is reported that the conspiracy is being planned and presided over by the American ambassador to Japan, Murphy. He is arranging for the Liberal Party's Ichiro Hatoyama and Tanzan Ishibashi groups, the Kaishinto Party's Mamoru Shigemitsu and Hitoshi Ashida groups, and the right-wing of the Socialist Party's Jusho Miwa, Suehiro Nishio, and Komakichi Matsuoka, and other "rearmament factions" to organize a coalition cabinet. To implement this plan, Murphy has taken out a huge sum of ten million U.S. dollars. Murphy intends to have this rearmament coalition cabinet revise the provisions of the Japanese Constitution regarding the renunciation of war and establish a huge Japanese American mercenary army.

Those who are coming forward to implement Murphy's plan are the Kaishinto Party's Shigemitsu Mamoru and Ashida Hitoshi groups. Before this, they had been heavily promoting "Shigemitsu Mamoru will replace Yoshida" throughout the country, and shamelessly advocated the re-militarization of Japan everywhere.

As everyone knows, Shigemitsu Mamoru is a Class A war criminal with heinous crimes. He directly instigated the "September 18th" invasion of China, and was also one of the masterminds behind the Nanjing Massacre and the Pacific War. In order to make use of him, the American occupiers illegally released him from Sugamo Prison ahead of schedule. Shigemitsu Mamoru not only accepted Murphy's "stipend," but Morgan, the legal counsel of the American Ford Company and an important figure in the American "Federal Bureau of Investigation," has also given Shigemitsu Mamoru at least 50 million yen in political funds. Shigemitsu Mamoru has in fact become an agent of the American "Federal Bureau of Investigation" in Japan. He attempts to achieve the goal of rearming Japan under the guise of "self-defense."

Everyone also knows that Ashida Hitoshi is also a notorious militarist. When he served as Prime Minister in 1948, he forcibly implemented harsh policies such as low wages, low rice prices, and heavy taxes, and was finally forced to resign in disgrace after being implicated in a major corruption scandal. In order to please his American masters so as to return to power, Ashida Hitoshi has consistently clamored for rearmament, and for this reason he brought the like-minded Shigemitsu Mamoru into the Kaishinto Party as president, attempting to use the Kaishinto Party as a means for himself to sell himself to the American masters and implement American aggression policies.

It can be seen from this that the Shigemitsu Mamoru and Ashida Hitoshi group and Yoshida's Liberal Party are birds of a feather, both of which are tools of aggression of the American occupiers. They unanimously want to re-militarize Japan and push Japan onto the destructive road of war.

The reason why the American occupiers want to support the Shigemitsu Mamoru and Ashida Hitoshi group is not because these notorious remnants of militarism can themselves win the support of the Japanese people, but more because there is still the faction of national capitalists led by Tokutaro Kitamura within the Kaishinto Party. Kitamura's open-minded policies of opposing American enslavement and demanding Japan-China trade are welcomed by the Japanese people. The American occupiers and their running dogs, Shigemitsu Mamoru and Ashida Hitoshi, are attempting to use this expectation of the Japanese people for certain enlightened elements within the Kaishinto Party to win votes in the election.

Even so, the American occupiers obviously do not dare to give too high expectations to the number of votes that the Shigemitsu Mamoru group can win in the election. Therefore, Murphy is planning to piece together a so-called "rearmament faction" coalition cabinet with the participation of various reactionary parties.

This conspiracy of the American occupiers cannot deceive the Japanese people. In this election struggle, the Japanese people are fighting to overthrow the Liberal Party and the Shigemitsu Mamoru and Ashida Hitoshi group of the Kaishinto Party.

    美国阴谋必要时利用重光葵等接替吉田
    【新华社六日讯】东京消息：美国占领者鉴于日本人民对反动腐朽的自由党的痛恨日益增长，以及吉田卖国政府被迫宣布提前大选所引起的紧急局势，正在以卑鄙的手段扶植以甲级战犯重光葵等为首的各个反动政党的军国主义分子参加大选，以便一旦在自由党吉田集团在大选中失势时，代替后者来组织所谓重整军备的内阁。
    吉田政府是美国占领者一手扶植起来的侵略工具，特别是在旧金山和约生效以后，美国尤其希望由吉田政府单独出面从事大规模重新武装，镇压日本人民的和平民主运动，而使美国占领者能够安然地隐在幕后，装出尊重日本“独立”的样子，缓和日本人民的反美情绪，以巩固美国对日本的控制。但是，日益高涨的日本人民争取和平、独立与民主的运动，迫使吉田政府不能按照其美国主子的希望，完成大规模重新武装的计划，最后并迫使吉田政府提前解散自由党占多数的国会。这种情形使美国占领者大感恐慌。因此，美国占领者正在指使另外一小撮臭名远扬的军国主义分子积极参加大选，以便在必要时用来接替吉田政府。
    据悉，筹划和主持这个阴谋的是美国驻日大使墨菲。他正在布置将来使自由党的鸠山一郎、石桥湛山集团，改进党的重光葵、芦田均集团和社会党右派的三轮寿壮、西尾末广、松冈驹吉等“重整军备派”组织联合内阁。为了实行这个计划，墨菲已拿出了一千万美元的巨款。墨菲打算由这个重整军备的联合内阁来修改日本宪法关于放弃战争的条款，建立一支庞大的日籍美国雇佣军。
    正面出来执行墨菲这个计划的是改进党的重光葵和芦田均集团，他们在此以前就在全国各地大事宣传“重光葵将接替吉田”，并且到处无耻鼓吹日本重新军国主义化。
    大家知道，重光葵是罪大恶极的甲级战犯，曾经直接策动“九一八”侵华战争，也是南京大屠杀和进行太平洋战争的主谋犯之一。美国占领者为了利用他，非法地把他从巢鸭监狱提前释放出来。重光葵不但接受了墨菲的“津贴”，并且美国福特公司法律顾问、美国“联邦调查局”的重要人物摩根至少也已交给重光葵五千万日元的政治资金。重光葵实际上已变成美国“联邦调查局”在日本的代理人。他企图借“自卫”之名，以达到重整日本军备的目的。
    大家也知道，芦田均同样是一个声名狼藉的军国主义分子。他在一九四八年出任首相时，曾经强制实行低工资、低米价、重税等等苛政，最后因为牵连在一个大贪污舞弊案中而被迫狼狈辞职。芦田均为了讨好其美国主子以便重新上台，一贯叫嚣重新武装，并为此将臭味相投的重光葵拉入改进党做总裁，企图以改进党为自己卖身美国主子和执行美国侵略政策的手段。
    由此可见，重光葵和芦田均集团与吉田的自由党正是一丘之貉，都是美国占领者的侵略工具。他们一致要使日本重新军国主义化，把日本推上毁灭的战争道路。
    美国占领者之所以要扶植重光葵和芦田均集团，并不是因为这些声名狼藉的军国主义残余分子本身还能骗取日本人民的支持，而是更多的着眼于在改进党内部还存在着以北村德太郎为首的民族资本家这一派。北村派的反对美国奴役、要求日中贸易等的开明政策，是受到日本人民的欢迎的。美国占领者及其走狗重光葵和芦田均就是企图利用日本人民对改进党内某些开明分子的这种期望，在大选中骗取选票。
    虽然如此，美国占领者显然对重光葵集团在大选中所能骗取的选票票数，仍不敢给予过高的期望。因此，墨菲正在计划拼凑一个由各反动政党参加的所谓“重整军备派”的联合内阁。
    美国占领者的这种阴谋是欺骗不了日本人民的。日本人民在这次大选斗争中，正在为打倒自由党和改进党的重光葵和芦田均集团而斗争。
