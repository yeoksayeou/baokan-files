    Great Achievements in Agricultural Production in New China Over the Past Three Years
    Li Shucheng, Minister of Agriculture, Central People's Government
    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the Chinese people are engaged in tremendous national construction work, and have achieved great victories in all aspects over the past three years. Now I will briefly talk about the achievements in agricultural production over the past three years.
    Thanks to the vigorous support of the People's Government and the efforts of all farmers, national agricultural production has not only recovered to the level before the Anti-Japanese War, but has also exceeded this level. This brilliant achievement is worth celebrating. Thanks to this achievement, the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of farmers have been significantly improved, and the foundation for the overall development of the entire national economy has been consolidated.
    As we welcome and celebrate the third National Day, in order to more fully understand the great significance of the achievements in agricultural production, it is necessary to recall the low state of national agricultural production when we began to restore production three years ago. During the more than ten years from the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War to the national liberation, the farmers' means of production suffered serious losses due to the destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. By 1949, the number of draught animals in the country had decreased by 16 percent, and the number of major agricultural implements had decreased by 30 percent. The broad masses of farmers suffered cruel oppression and exploitation politically and economically, and had neither the morale nor the strength to carry out expanded reproduction. Therefore, the level of national agricultural production decreased year by year before liberation. By 1949, grain output had fallen to 74.6 percent of the pre-war level, and cotton had fallen to 52 percent. After liberation, the Central People's Government led the nation's farmers to carry out tremendous recovery work at a rapid pace on the basis of such low production levels and a dilapidated rural economy. Over the past three years, agricultural production has shown a trend of increasing year by year. For example, if the grain and cotton output in 1949 is taken as 100, then the grain output increased to 117 in 1950, 128 in 1951, and can be expected to rise to around 140 this year; cotton output increased to 159 in 1950, 252 in 1951, and can be expected to rise to around 300 this year. Judging from the growth and harvest of crops in various places, this year's production plan can be completed and may even be exceeded. In this way, our country's grain output this year will exceed the pre-war level by 9 percent, cotton will exceed the pre-war level by more than half, tea will increase by about two and a half times compared with 1950, flue-cured tobacco will increase by about two times compared with 1950, and domestic silk will increase by about 50 percent compared with 1950. Fruit production has also greatly increased, with citrus fruit production doubling.
    Over the past three years, China's animal husbandry has also made significant progress. The number of various livestock has increased significantly, with large livestock increasing by 26 percent and sheep increasing by 42 percent. Thanks to the active development of disease prevention and control work, the incidence of various livestock diseases has decreased year by year. Over the past three years, a total of more than 40 million head of livestock have been treated for disease prevention. Cattle plague, which was the most widespread, has now been basically eradicated.
    The recovery and development of the aquatic products industry has also made great achievements in these three years. In 1949, the country's total fishery output fell to about 30 percent of the pre-war production level. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, it vigorously supported fishermen to restore production and abolished the feudal exploitation system. Over the past three years, fishery output has increased by about three times. The aquatic products industry in New China has shown a new look.
    Over the past three years, what are the reasons why China's agriculture, animal husbandry, and aquatic products industry have been able to recover and develop so rapidly? We must realize that this is because we have the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. Under this correct leadership, we have implemented a series of policies to develop agricultural production and have done a series of specific tasks to develop agricultural production. The most important of these policies and tasks are the following:
    First, land reform was implemented step by step throughout the country, liberating agricultural productive forces. The broad masses of farmers became the masters of their own land, and their enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high, so their production and lives were quickly improved. Let me give an example from the hometown of overseas Chinese. In Shanya Village, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, almost half of the households are family members of overseas Chinese. Before the land reform, most of them lived on sweet potatoes. Now that they have been allocated land, every family regularly eats white rice. This year, the village's early rice output increased by 30 percent compared with the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule. In areas where land reform was implemented earlier, production development has been even more significant. With the improvement of the material lives of the broad masses of farmers, their cultural lives have also improved. In the first half of 1951, there were already 250,000 winter schools and 150,000 regular people's schools in rural areas across the country. Now, many mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives subscribe to newspapers and magazines. All facts prove that land reform is the basic factor in promoting the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production.
    The second is to implement the direction of "organizing" indicated by Chairman Mao. At present, more than 40 percent of farmers across the country have participated in various forms of mutual aid teams, and more than 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives and more than ten collective farms have been established in various places. Facts have proved that the more advanced the form of mutual aid and cooperation, the greater the superiority in production and the higher the yield of crops; and the organizational form is generally from low to high, gradually progressing, and gradually developing according to the needs of farmers' production and the degree of awareness. "Organizing" enables the broad masses of farmers to develop production together, which is fundamentally different from the capitalist line of rising living standards for a few and declining living standards for the majority. It is the best guarantee for the broad masses of farmers to universally increase production and for the vast majority of people to obtain the greatest benefits. In order to provide demonstration education on collectivization for farmers, 52 large-scale mechanized state-owned farms have been established across the country over the past three years. Although these farms are still in the trial stage, they have indicated a bright future for the development of production to farmers.
    The third is to implement a series of policies to reward production. Over the past three years, a large number of agricultural loans have been issued to help poor farmers solve the difficulties of lacking livestock, agricultural implements, seeds, and fertilizers; reasonable price policies and purchasing policies have been implemented to ensure reasonable income for farmers from the sale of agricultural and sideline products; supply and marketing cooperatives have been greatly developed to fully supply farmers with industrial products and strengthen urban-rural mutual assistance; in addition, the "reasonable burden" tax policy and the bumper harvest reward policy have played a great role in encouraging farmers to vigorously increase production.
    The fourth is to lead farmers to resolutely overcome natural disasters. Due to the long-term rule of the past reactionary government, forests were destroyed and river embankments were not repaired, and natural disasters seriously threatened agricultural production. Over the past three years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, large-scale water conservancy construction has been carried out, and mass movements to build small-scale water conservancy projects to prevent and combat drought have been widely launched, which has not only controlled the flood threat of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, but also expanded and improved the irrigation area of approximately 220 million mu of farmland. Large-scale prevention and control movements have also been launched for pest and disease disasters. Over the past three years, a total of more than 120 million people have been mobilized to carry out arduous work to prevent and control pest and disease disasters on more than 540 million mu of cultivated land, reducing agricultural losses equivalent to more than 30 billion catties of grain.
    The fifth is to carry out mass technical improvement work. Due to the implementation of the correct line of combining agricultural science and technology with farmers' production experience, "from the masses, to the masses," farmers' production technology has been initially improved over the past three years. The accumulation of fertilizer, application of fertilizer, seed selection, seed soaking, and pest and disease control have all formed mass movements. The national fertilization area has increased by 15 percent, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased by 30 percent. Improved varieties of food crops have been promoted and sown on more than 200 million mu, and improved varieties of cotton have accounted for more than half of the total cotton field area. Many farms and advanced farmers have comprehensively improved cultivation techniques. They have accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, implemented reasonable close planting and deep plowing, and have also created a set of mature experiences in land preparation, fertilization, seed selection, sowing, cultivating, irrigating, and preventing and controlling pests and diseases. Therefore, over the past three years, many outstanding high-yield models have emerged across the country. For example, in 1951, Qu Yaoli in Shanxi Province created a new record of producing 912 catties of seed cotton per mu of cotton field, Yang Zhenru in Hebei Province produced 1,620 catties of rice per mu, Laiwu Farm in Shandong Province produced 915 catties of wheat per mu this year, and Wei Mingbiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province harvested 732 catties of dryland wheat per mu. It is especially worth mentioning that a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed on the north bank of the Kaidu River in Xinjiang has 10.78 mu of high-yield wheat land, with a yield of 1,377 catties and 11 taels per mu, creating the highest wheat high-yield record in my country's history. These models have illuminated a bright future for the popularization and improvement of agricultural science and technology.
    Finally, we should especially mention the patriotic production increase campaign that is being enthusiastically carried out in the vast rural areas. This movement was launched by the broad masses of farmers inspired by the great victories of the three major movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It is a concrete manifestation of the unprecedented high political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the peasant masses, and it is a magnificent production upsurge set off by millions of labor troops. From this upsurge, we can see that my country's agricultural productive forces are developing vigorously; we can also see that all the potential for developing production is gradually being brought into play, becoming a vivid and powerful factor in increasing production; we can see even more clearly that our rural economy is gradually moving towards an infinitely bright future.
    Over the past three years, our achievements in agricultural production have been great, but we have only slightly exceeded the backward production level of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. We are not satisfied with this slight excess. For the gradual industrialization of the country, for the greater prosperity and strength of our motherland, and for the richer lives of the people of the whole country, we must have a high degree of confidence and more actively carry out large-scale agricultural construction. We are confident that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party, and under the superior people's democratic dictatorship system, our happy and beautiful prospects will be presented before us more and more closely.

    三年来新中国农业生产上的伟大成就
    中央人民政府农业部部长　李书城
    中国人民，在毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导之下，进行着巨大的国家建设工作，三年来，各方面都已经获得了伟大的胜利。现在我扼要地讲一下农业生产方面三年来的成就。
    三年来，由于人民政府的大力扶持和全体农民的努力，全国农业生产不但恢复到抗日战争以前的水平，而且超过了这个水平。这个辉煌的成就是值得庆幸的。由于这个成就，广大农民的物质生活和文化生活已经得到显著的改善，整个国民经济全面发展的基础已经稳固起来。
    在我们迎接和庆祝第三届国庆节的时候，为了更充分地了解农业生产成就的巨大意义，回想一下三年前开始恢复生产时全国农业生产低落的情况是必要的。从抗日战争开始到全国解放的十多年间，由于日寇和蒋介石匪帮的摧残破坏，农民的生产资料遭受了严重的损失。到一九四九年，全国耕畜减少了百分之十六，主要农具减少了百分之三十。广大农民在政治上和经济上遭受着残酷的压迫和剥削，既无情绪也无力量进行扩大再生产。因此，解放以前全国农业生产水平一年比一年降低，到一九四九年粮食产量已经降到战前水平的百分之七十四·六，棉花降到百分之五十二。解放以后，中央人民政府就在这样生产水平低落、农村经济凋敝的基础上，领导全国农民以很快的速度进行了巨大的恢复工作。三年来，农业生产呈现了逐年上升的趋势。如以一九四九年粮食产量和棉花产量当作一百，那么粮食产量，一九五○年上升为一百一十七，一九五一年上升为一百二十八，今年可以上升到一百四十上下；棉花产量一九五○年上升为一百五十九，一九五一年上升为二百五十二，今年可以上升到三百上下。从现在各地庄稼生长和收获的情形看来，今年的生产计划可以完成，并且可能超过。这样，我国今年粮食产量将超过战前百分之九，棉花将超过战前一半以上，茶叶约比一九五○年增产两倍半，烤烟约比一九五○年增产两倍，家蚕丝约比一九五○年增产百分之五十。水果产量也大大提高，其中柑桔产量增加了一倍。
    三年来，我国的畜牧业也有显著的进展。各种牲畜显著增加，大牲畜增加百分之二十六，绵羊增加百分之四十二。由于积极开展了兽疫防治工作，各种牲畜疫病发生率逐年降低。三年来，一共防治牲畜疫病四千多万头。流行最广的牛瘟，现在已经基本上被消灭了。
    水产业的恢复和发展，在这三年里也有很大的成就。一九四九年全国渔业总产量下降到战前生产水平的百分之三十左右。中央人民政府成立以后，大力扶持渔民恢复生产，废除封建剥削制度，三年来渔业产量约增加三倍。新中国的水产业已经呈现了新的面貌。
    三年来，我国的农业、畜牧业和水产业能够这样迅速地恢复和发展，究竟是什么原因呢？我们必须认识到，这是因为有了中国共产党和中央人民政府的正确领导。在这正确的领导下，我们实行了一系列发展农业生产的政策，做了一系列发展农业生产的具体工作。这些政策和工作，最主要的有下列几项：
    首先是有步骤地在全国范围实行了土地改革，解放了农业生产力。广大农民成为自己土地的主人，生产积极性空前提高，因而他们的生产和生活很快地得到改善。举一个华侨家乡的例子吧，福建省晋江县山雅村几乎有二分之一的农户是华侨的家属，土地改革前他们多半都是吃甘薯过日子，现在分得了土地，家家经常吃白米饭了，今年全村早稻产量比国民党反动统治时期提高了三成。实行土地改革比较早的地区，生产的发展就更为显著了。随着广大农民物质生活的改善，文化生活也提高了。一九五一年上半年，全国农村中的冬学已经有二十五万处，常年民校已经有十五万处。现在，有很多互助组、农业生产合作社都订阅了报纸和杂志。一切事实都证明，土地改革是促进农业生产迅速恢复和发展的基本的因素。
    其次是贯彻了毛主席所指示的“组织起来”的方向。目前全国已经有百分之四十以上的农户参加了各种形式的互助组，各地成立了四千多个农业生产合作社，创办了十多个集体农庄。事实证明，互助合作组织的形式越是高级，生产上的优越性就越大，农作物的收获量也就越高；而组织形式一般是由低级到高级，循序渐进，根据农民生产需要和觉悟程度逐步向前发展的。“组织起来”使得广大农民共同发展生产，它与少数人生活上升、多数人生活下降的资本主义路线是根本不同的。它是使广大农民普遍增产，使最大多数人民获得最大利益的最好的保证。为了对农民进行集体化的示范教育，三年来全国各地举办了五十二个规模较大的机械化国营农场，这些农场虽然仍在试办阶段，但是已给农民指示出发展生产的远大前途。
    第三是贯彻了一系列奖励生产的政策。三年来发放大批农业贷款，帮助贫苦农民解决了缺乏牲畜、农具、种子、肥料等的困难；实施合理的价格政策与收购政策，保证了农民出售农业产品和副业产品的合理收益；大量发展供销合作社，充分供应农民工业产品，密切了城乡互助；此外，“合理负担”的税收政策和丰产奖励政策，对于鼓舞农民大力增产，都起了很大的作用。
    第四是领导农民坚决地战胜自然灾害。由于过去反动政府的长期统治，山林破坏、河堤失修，自然灾害严重地威胁着农业生产。三年来，在中国共产党和人民政府的正确领导下，进行了大规模的水利建设，广泛地开展了群众性的兴修小型水利防旱抗旱运动，不仅控制住江淮大河的洪水威胁，并且扩大和改善了大约有二亿二千多万亩农田的灌溉面积。对于病虫灾害，也开展了规模巨大的防治运动。三年来一共动员一亿两千多万人，在五亿四千多万亩耕地上，进行了艰巨的防治病虫灾害的工作，减少农产损失折成粮食约达到三百亿斤以上。
    第五是开展了群众性的技术改进工作。由于贯彻了农业科学技术和农民生产经验相结合的、“从群众中来到群众中去”的正确路线，三年来农民生产技术已经有初步改进。积肥、施肥、选种、浸种、防治病虫都已经形成了群众性的运动。全国施肥面积增加了百分之十五，施肥量增加了百分之三十。粮食作物的优良品种已经推广播种二亿多亩，棉花优良品种已经占棉田总面积的一半以上。很多农场和先进的农民，全面地改进了栽培技术。他们接受了苏联的先进经验，实行合理密植和深耕，同时对整地、施肥、选种、播种、中耕、灌溉、防治病虫等，也都创造了一套成熟的经验。因此，三年来，全国已经出现很多卓越的丰产典型。例如一九五一年山西省曲耀离创造了每亩棉田产籽棉九百一十二斤的新纪录，河北省杨振儒每亩水稻产一千六百二十斤，今年山东省莱芜农场每亩产小麦九百一十五斤，山西省武乡县魏名标农业生产合作社旱地小麦每亩收七百三十二斤，尤其值得提出的是，人民解放军驻屯在新疆开都河北岸的某部，有十亩七分八厘小麦丰产地，每亩产量为一千三百七十七斤十一两，创造了我国历史上最高的小麦丰产纪录。这些典型，为农业科学技术的普及和提高，照耀出了光明的前途。
    最后，我们应当特别提出的是，在广大农村热烈开展着的爱国增产竞赛运动。这个运动，是广大农民为抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动的伟大胜利所鼓舞而开展起来的，是农民群众政治积极性与生产积极性空前高涨的具体表现，是千百万劳动大军所掀起的波澜壮阔的生产高潮。从这个高潮里，我们可以看到，我国的农业生产力正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展着；也可以看到，潜藏着的一切发展生产的可能性，正在逐渐被发挥出来，成为提高生产的生动有力的因素；我们更可以看到，我们农村经济正在逐渐走向无限美好的前程。
    三年来，我们农业生产上的成就是伟大的，但是，我们还只是稍稍超过了旧中国半封建半殖民地的落后的生产水平。我们并不为这个水平的稍有超过而满足。为国家的逐步工业化，为我们祖国的更加富强和繁荣，为全国人民生活的更加丰裕，我们还必须有高度的信心，更积极地进行大规模的农业建设。我们确信，在英明的毛主席领导之下，在伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党领导之下，在优越的人民民主专政制度之下，我们幸福美好的远景，将要日益迫近地展现在眼前了。（新华社）
