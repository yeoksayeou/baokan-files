    On the Peaceful Land of the Motherland
    Singing Instructions
    This song expresses the joyful mood of our people in carrying out the great cause of peaceful construction, and their will and determination to defend world peace. The tempo should be slightly faster when singing. The first part of the song should be sung joyfully and powerfully, especially the first few beats where each word has one note, and should be sung fully and solidly. On the other hand, the smoothness of the melody should be fully expressed.
    Starting from "We love peace," it turns to an impassioned fighting mood, and the enthusiastic and firm emotions should be expressed with a clear and powerful voice. The sentence "We and the people of the whole world..." should be sung with a calm and progressive momentum, and gradually strengthened, leading to the climax of the ending. When singing the last two words "Forward!", be careful not to weaken the strength. (Guo Naian)

    在祖国和平的土地上
    唱法说明
    这首歌表现了我国人民在进行伟大的和平建设事业中的愉快情绪，和保卫世界和平的意志与决心。唱时速度宜稍快。歌曲前段应唱得愉快有力，特别是开始几拍一字一音的地方，要唱得丰满结实。另一方面要把曲调的流畅性充分表现出来。
    自“我们热爱和平”起，转向昂扬的战斗的情绪，要以明朗有力的声音把热烈而坚定的情绪表现出来。“我们和全世界人民……”一句，要以沉着前进的气势唱出来，并逐渐加强，引向结束的高潮。唱至最后的“前进！”二字时，须注意勿使力量减弱。（郭乃安）
