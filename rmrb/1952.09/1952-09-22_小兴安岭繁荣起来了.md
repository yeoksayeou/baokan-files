    The Lesser Khingan Mountains are Prospering
    By Our Correspondent Yong Jin
    The train passes through Harbin, then north through Suihua and Qing'an, and arrives at Tie Li. From here, the railway extends five hundred li all the way to Yichun. Along the way are the dense forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains that stretch as far as the eye can see. But this is just a corner of the Lesser Khingan. Forest surveyors here have been investigating since the winter of 1950, and the area their footprints have covered is only a small area of the Tangwang River in the Lesser Khingan Mountains.
    According to people living in Yichun City, there were only a few single men here in 1947. Their houses were located in the wilderness at the foot of the mountains, and life was very difficult. Tigers, wolves, bears, and other wild animals often threatened them. When the Japanese devils occupied the Lesser Khingan Mountains, they often captured people from the interior to work here without pay, plundering timber for them. Many people starved to death, froze to death, or were crushed to death by felled trees in the forest.
    With the liberation of Northeast China and the whole country, and with the arrival of great economic construction, the spring sunshine of the motherland warmed the Lesser Khingan Mountains. From 1948 to the present, many Communist Party cadres and workers have responded to the call of the state to come to the Lesser Khingan Mountains for exploitation and construction. The efforts of these people have made the Lesser Khingan Mountains prosperous. Now, Yichun, located in a beautiful natural setting, has endless mountains, forests, and the quiet Tangwang River as a screen, with more than a dozen apricot-yellow and red buildings standing tall, equipped with heating and running water. There is a workers' sanatorium here, where workers from the tractor team and the timber mill, the timber loading station come to recuperate. The newly built workers' hotel with its sky-blue river bridge, the stadium enclosed with green-painted wooden fences, and the billowing black smoke from the power plant chimneys all make people feel that the Lesser Khingan Mountains are no longer a backward area.
    On moonlit nights, beautiful piano music and the sounds of radios and phonographs come from the buildings, sometimes interspersed with the train's deep whistle, the sawmills' sawing sounds, the club building's gongs and drums, and the young workers' militant waist drum sounds. The sounds reverberate through the forests of the Lesser Khingan Mountains, making people ponder the victory of labor and joyous excitement. The club shows many films depicting revolutionary struggles, as well as popular "Water Margin," "The Heavenly River Fairy," and other dramas reflecting revolutionary struggles. The Yichun forest area is changing and expanding with each passing day. Every midnight, trains crowded with developers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains arrive; before dawn, they knock on the door of the building, requesting to be assigned work. Here, like other cities in the new China, no matter how busy the builders are, the houses built can never meet the actual needs. Now, Yichun is filled with construction scaffolding, and the streets are covered with handcarts transporting bricks and stones. Yichun had only 12,000 people a few months ago, but now it has increased to 22,000. The population of the Yichun forest area has soared to 80,000. Here there is fertile black soil, and people can cultivate it at will. Whether you farm or work, you can live a wealthy life. When I visited a worker's family, a man wearing a gray khaki uniform came in, with thermal underwear and a black shirt underneath. When asked, he said he was a loader named Liang Zhaohai, originally from Chaocheng County, Pingyuan Province, who came to Guanwai before the War of Resistance. He said that when he first came, he ate acorn flour that even pigs and cattle didn't like to eat, and wore "Gengshen" clothes (a very poor material made of hemp and broken cotton by the Japanese). Now, he said, he can save 6 million yuan a month to send home, and he plans to move his family here. Liang Zhaohai said excitedly that he had "turned over"! After telling about his happy life, he concluded: This is because of the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    In Yichun in September, there is still a lot of rain, the climate is humid, and it has a Jiangnan flavor. The corn planted by farmers on the black soil here is like the sorghum of North China, with ears like large bull horns. There are potatoes and tomatoes, cucumbers and green onions. The fences of many farmers are covered with dense vines, full of clusters of Mei beans and green beans. The Chinese cabbage, peppers, radishes and eggplants here are not smaller than those in the interior, and the taste is not inferior to those in the interior. Night fragrance, dandelions, West Fenlian and other flowers and plants brought by people from the interior are blooming in the gardens in front of the Yichun staff office building and in the workers' courtyards. On the hillside on the west bank of the Tangwang River, there is a lovely bee farm. A small, flat, clean area of land is flanked by blooming sunflower flowers. The number of bees has now increased to nearly a hundred hives. This year, there has been more rain, and the bees have produced less honey than in previous years, with each hive only able to collect 60 or 70 jin (in previous years, many collected more than 100 jin). Due to the lack of honey, many bees have not split their hives. The Lesser Khingan Mountains forest area is a good source of honey, and according to the wishes of the developers, beehives will be placed throughout the Lesser Khingan Mountains. At that time, people all over the country will taste sweet white honey.
    The Lesser Khingan Mountains have accumulated a large amount of timber, and it is good red pine. In recent years, the developers have supplied the red pine here to the country's great construction projects, such as the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project, the Huaihe and Yellow River projects, important railway projects, and so on.
    The Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members among the developers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains are universally praised by the people in the forest area. Zhang Ziliang, a hard-working and simple Communist Party member, came to the forest area with a small luggage roll and an old military coat. He ate sorghum rice with the workers, studied Soviet experience with them, and created many new records. Finally, he overcame difficulties and completed the state's logging tasks. The workers loved him and sent him eggs and peppers, but he refused to accept them. Later, when there was really no way, he kept a few red peppers. Another Communist Party member, Liu Jingui, created the experience of lowering the cutting roots. The promotion and application of this experience has saved the country an immeasurable amount of timber. People selected him to attend the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants and Soldiers in Beijing. Wang Jingbo had fifteen inventions and creations last year. During the major machine overhaul in July this year, he proposed not to stop the machine, but to repair a broken boiler first, so that the other two boilers could be inspected in turn. This resulted in an additional 5,000 meters of timber in July, worth 3.6 billion yuan; and it also enabled other machines to be repaired on time.
    In the Cuiluan area of the Yichun forest area, there is a youth logging team. There are fifteen Communist Youth League members among the fifty young logging workers. They increased the distance of sending timber by a water gate from one kilometer to four kilometers; they accepted the advanced Soviet experience, increased work efficiency by 35% in one year, and did not have a single accident. The Dong Derong team of the Communist Youth League in the Lesser Khingan Mountains originally planned to cut 1,000 meters of timber in two months, but completed it in half a month. Moreover, not a single tool was damaged, and there were no casualties within a year.
    In the timber mill, the workers' labor is particularly tense. Their eyes, hands, and brains are moving non-stop every minute. With a little negligence, the huge trees may damage the body, and the fast-moving fire saw may cut off the hand. After tense and complex labor, they turn the trees into various useful timbers. The train then happily departs from here fully loaded to all parts of the country. An old worker with more than 20 years of experience told me that they responded to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, and decided to save 15,900 tons of grain from the end of June to the end of this year. He said: "We want to overfulfill the task and produce more first-class timber."
    In the west of Yichun, a large number of tractors under repair are parked. These came in the autumn of 1950. When they first came, the drivers' skills were not proficient, and they did not pull much, which caused some employees to doubt. But the tractor drivers were not discouraged at all. They lived in low wooden board houses, were rained on, ate sorghum rice, and had no vegetables. After working all day, they were disturbed by bedbugs, fleas, and mosquitoes at night and could not rest well. Some were dizzy from the yellow smoke emitted by the tractors, and were sprayed with cold water to wake up and continued to work. Sometimes they didn't close their eyes or eat for a day and a night. As a result of such painstaking research, they pulled from a few meters to dozens of meters, and all the way to 160 meters, and finally convinced people of the benefits of tractors. In 1951, 50% of the timber in the Yichun forest area was transported by tractors. From the train driving into the Lesser Khingan Mountains from Tie Li, the hundreds of miles of forests along the line are exciting, but also sad. In many small groves, there are many charred large tree trunks. This is the result of the constant fires in the forest area during the Japanese occupation. At that time, fires could only be extinguished by heavy rain. Fire prevention was something people didn't know about. After liberation, the situation gradually changed. In March this year, the fire prevention instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China were transmitted to the Lesser Khingan Mountains. Communist Party members and the broad masses of Yichun carefully arranged the work of protecting forests and preventing fires. The beginning of September is the beginning of closing the mountains. From this time on, all roads leading to the forest are guarded by women with red-tasseled spears. Now there are nearly a thousand fire prevention teams in Yichun alone. Here, large-scale mass fire prevention and forest protection parades have been held, and everyone has signed their names for it. "Everyone is responsible for fire prevention" has become the slogan of the masses. They implement a special responsibility system, with groups and groups, classes and classes dividing fire prevention areas. In the dry spring and early winter, they guard their forests day and night. The Oroqen and other ethnic hunters often set fires to burn mountains during the Japanese rule, so that fresh grass would grow in the burned areas, attracting wild deer and other animals to eat grass. Now, they have all become active preventers of fires. This is because the Party and the People's Government have helped them improve their lives and raised their political awareness.
    The developers of the Lesser Khingan Mountains are also the planters of the Lesser Khingan Mountains. They are not only working hard to log, but also working hard to plant trees. They cleared the logged forest farms and planted new red pines. Many seeds were dug up by squirrels, and later they adopted the method of transplanting. This year, the five cultivation stations of Wudaoku, Xiying, and Shuangzihe alone transplanted 120,000 seedlings, with a survival rate of 80% to 96%. Seedlings are easy to plant alive when it rains, so they transplant them in the rain. In addition, all logged forest farms must leave 15 to 20 mother trees to reproduce seedlings. They plan to plant as much as they log within five years. They want to make the Lesser Khingan Mountains evergreen for ten thousand years and always prosper. This slogan is not a fantasy. In many logged forest farms, I saw new red pine saplings growing vigorously among the flowers and plants. The future Lesser Khingan Mountains will be even more lush and beautiful.

    小兴安岭繁荣起来了
    本报记者  勇进
    火车驶过哈尔滨，再往北驶过绥化和庆安，便到了铁?。从这里沿着铁路伸延五百里，一直到伊春，一路上都是望不到头的小兴安岭的茂密森林。但这只不过是小兴安岭的一个角落。这里的森林调查人员从一九五零年冬天调查到现在，足迹走到的地方，也不过是小兴安岭上汤旺河的狭小的地带。
    据居住在伊春城的人们谈，这里在一九四七年时还只有少数单身汉。他们的房子座落在山麓下的荒草里，生活很困难，虎、狼、狗熊和其他野兽时常威胁着他们。日本鬼子在他们占领小兴安岭的时候，时常捕捉内地的老百姓到这里来，进行无代价的劳动，为他们掠夺木材。不少的人饿死、冻死或被砍倒的树木砸死在森林里。
    随着东北和全国的解放，随着伟大的经济建设的到来，祖国的春光照暖了小兴安岭。从一九四八年到现在，有不少的共产党员干部和工人响应国家的召唤，来小兴安岭进行开采和建设。这些人的努力，使小兴安岭繁荣了起来。现在，座落在自然美景之中的伊春，有无尽的山峦、森林和静静的汤旺河作屏风，有十几处杏黄色的和红色的楼房耸立起来，里面有暖气和自来水的装置。这里有工人疗养院，拖拉机队和制材厂、出河厂等处的工人都来这里休养。新建的工人旅馆的天蓝色的河桥，用绿漆木栅围起的体育场，发电厂的烟囱里冒出的滚滚黑烟，都使人感到小兴安岭不再是落后的地区了。
    在皓月当空的夜里，楼房里传出优美的琴声和收音机、留声机的声音，有时夹着火车头的雄浑的拉鼻声，制材厂的锯木声，俱乐部大楼里的锣鼓声，年轻职工们的战斗的腰鼓声。声音震荡着小兴安岭的森林，使人寻味着劳动的胜利和欢欣鼓舞。俱乐部上映了很多描写革命斗争的影片，也上演了吸引观众的水泊梁山、天河配和其他反映革命斗争的戏剧。伊春林区在日新月异地变化着，扩大着。每天午夜，列车拥挤地载来小兴安岭的开采者；天不明，他们就扣开楼门，请求分配工作。这里也和新中国的其他城市一样，不管建筑者们如何忙碌，建起的房子总是不能满足实际的需要。现在，伊春搭满了建筑的木架，街道上满铺着运砖运石的手车道。伊春前几个月还是一万二千人，现在已增加到二万二千人。伊春林区的人口则激增到八万人。这里有肥沃的黑土，人们可以随便耕耘。任你耕地或作工，都可以生活得很富裕。我在一个工人家庭里访问的时候，进来一个穿着一身灰色卡叽布衣服的人，里面还穿着卫生衣和黑色单衣。问起来，他才说他是装车工人，叫梁兆海，原籍平原省朝城县，是抗战前来关外的。他说，他初来时吃的是猪牛都不大吃的橡子面，穿的是“更身”（日本人用麻和破棉花做的极坏的衣料）衣。现在呢，他说，他每月能节省六十万元寄回家去，还准备把家搬到这里来。梁兆海兴高采烈地说，他“翻身了”！他把他的幸福生活说了之后，结语说：这是由于共产党和毛主席领导得好。
    伊春的九月，雨水还很多，气候湿润，颇有江南风味。这里的农民在黑土上种植的玉米，有如华北的高粮，穗子像大牛角。这里有土豆也有西红柿，有黄瓜也有大葱。许多农户的篱笆上缠着繁密的秧，结满了累累的梅豆、豆角。这里的大白菜和辣椒、萝卜和茄子，都不比内地小，味道也不比内地逊色。人们从内地带来的夜香、蒲公英、西芬莲以及其他的花草，都在伊春职工办公楼前的花园里和工人的庭院里开放了。在汤旺河西岸的山坡上，有一座可爱的蜂厂。一小块平坦干净的地面，两边是盛开的向日葵花。蜜蜂现已增加到近一百窝。今年雨水较多，蜜蜂产蜜较往年少，每窝只能收六、七十斤（往年多者收一百多斤）。由于蜜少，蜜蜂也多未分窝。小兴安岭林区是很好的蜜源，按照开采者的意愿，蜂房将遍置在小兴安岭。那时祖国各地的人们将尝到甘美的白色蜂蜜。
    小兴安岭蓄积了大量的木材，并且是好的红松。几年来，开采者们曾以这里的红松供应祖国的伟大建筑工程，如荆江分洪工程，淮河和黄河的工程，重要的铁路工程等等。
    小兴安岭开采者中的共产党员、青年团员们，受到林区人们的普遍称颂。坚苦朴素的共产党员张子良初来林区时，夹着一个小行李卷，穿着一件旧军大衣，和工人们一块吃高粱米，一块钻研苏联的经验，创造了很多新纪录，终于克服困难，完成了国家的采伐任务。工人们爱护他，给他送鸡蛋，送辣椒，他都不肯受。后来实在没办法了，才留几个红辣椒。另一共产党员刘金贵，创造了降低伐根的经验。这个经验的推广应用，给国家节约了无可计量的木材。人们曾选他到北京出席了全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。王静波去年一年就有十五种发明创造。今年七月机器大修理时，他提议不停车，先修理好一台破锅炉，使另外两个锅炉轮流检修。这使七月份多出了五千米木材，值三十六亿元；并使其他机器也按时修好了。
    在伊春林区的翠峦间，有一个青年采伐队。五十个青年采伐工人中有十五个青年团员。他们把一闸水流送木材一公里提高到流送四公里；他们接受了苏联的先进经验，在一年中提高工作效率百分之三十五，没有发生一次事故。小兴安岭的青年团员董德荣小队，原计划两个月采伐木材一千米，结果半个月就完成了。而且一件工具也没损坏，一年内无一伤亡。
    在制材厂，工人们的劳动特别紧张。他们的眼睛和手、脑，一分钟不停地运动着。稍有疏忽，巨大的树木就可能把身体碰坏，飞快的火锯就可能把手砍断。经过紧张复杂的劳动，他们使树木变成各种有用的木材。火车即从这里满载地愉快地驶向各地。一个二十多年的老工人告诉我，他们响应增产节约的号召，决定从今年六月底到年底要节约一万五千九百吨粮食。他说：“我们要超额完成任务，还要多出一等木材。”
    在伊春的西面，停留着一大批正在检修的拖拉机。这是一九五零年秋天来的。初来时，由于驾驶人员技术不熟练，拉得不多，曾引起一部分职工怀疑。但是拖拉机手们一点没有泄气。他们住在低矮的小木板房里，受着雨淋，吃着高粱米，没有蔬菜。白天劳动一天，夜里睡觉还要受臭虫、跳蚤和蚊子的扰害，不能好好休息。有的被拖拉机喷出的黄烟熏得晕倒，又用冷水喷醒过来，继续工作。有时一天一夜连眼也不合，饭也不吃。这样苦心钻研的结果，他们从原来的几米拉到几十米，一直拉到一百六十米，终于使人们信服了拖拉机的好处。一九五一年，伊春林区的全部木材，靠拖拉机运了百分之五十。从铁?驶进小兴安岭的列车上，沿线数百里的林木令人兴奋，但也令人难过。许多小树丛里，都有不少烧焦了的粗大的树干。这是日本鬼子统治时期林区不断发生大火灾的结果。那时期，火灾只有等大雨来浇灭。防火是人们不知道的事情。解放后情况逐渐改变了。今年三月，中共中央的防火指示传到了小兴安岭。伊春的共产党员和广大群众周密地布置了护林防火的工作。九月初是封山的开始。从这时起，所有通向森林的道路都被拿红缨枪的妇女守卫起来。现在只伊春就有近千人的防火中队。这里曾举行广大群众性的防火护林游行，每个人都为此签了名。“防火人人有责”成了群众的口号。他们实行专责制，由组和组，班和班划分防火地区。在天气干燥的春天和初冬，他们日夜不停地守护着自己的森林。鄂伦春族和其他族的狩猎者们，在日本统治时代，时常放火烧山，使烧过的地方长出鲜草，吸引野鹿等兽类来吃草。现在，他们都变成了火灾的积极防范者。这是因为党和人民政府帮助他们改善了生活，提高了他们的政治觉悟。
    小兴安岭的开采者，也是小兴安岭的播种者。他们不仅在努力采伐，而且也在努力植树。他们清理了采伐过的林场，又种上新的红松。种籽被松鼠挖得很多，以后又采取了移植的办法。仅五道库、西营、双子河四个抚育站，今年就移苗十二万株，成活率达百分之八十到九十六。下雨时幼苗容易栽活，他们就冒雨移植。此外，所有伐过的林场，都要留下十五棵到二十棵母树，让其繁殖幼苗。他们计划在五年内作到采伐多少种植多少。他们要使小兴安岭万年长青，永远繁荣。这口号并不是幻想。在采伐过的许多林场上，我看到新的红松幼树茁壮地长在花草之间。未来的小兴安岭，将更加繁茂，更加美丽。
