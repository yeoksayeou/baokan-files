　　Seven and a Half Days to Build a Floor
　　——An Interview with Wang Sunci, Creator of Segmented Assembly Line Method
　　Chen Ji

Anyone who has met Wang Sunci will feel that he is meticulous, diligent in research, and has a very precise mind. He loves his work very much and is eager to achieve more in his work. He believes that not studying his work is irresponsible; being satisfied with existing achievements is voluntarily falling behind. He is from Fujian, an apprentice by training, never attended university, and hasn't read many books. Now he has become a construction site director, leading the construction work of the Third Construction Zone of the Northeast Electric Engineering Bureau of Harbin.

　　Discovering the Problem

In 1950, he came to the Northeast from Fujian and served as a technical inspector in the capital construction section of a factory under the Electric Engineering Bureau. As soon as he arrived in the Northeast, he felt that the construction period in the Northeast was too short, with only half a year in a year suitable for building houses. “Oh! The construction period is so short! A project that can be completed in one year in Fujian would take two years to complete in the Northeast!” Once, at a construction site in Shenyang, he found that all the bricklayers had stopped working, waiting to start laying bricks on the concrete floor only after the concrete project was completed. Wang Sunci thought to himself: Can’t this be changed? Why can’t the bricklaying project and the concrete project be done simultaneously? The construction period in the Northeast is so short, is it right to wait like this? This series of questions often swirled in his mind.

　　The Birth of Segmented Assembly Line Method

At the beginning of this year, the Electric Engineering Bureau established a construction office and transferred Wang Sunci to serve as the construction site director of the Third Construction Zone in Harbin, responsible for the construction of a three-story building with more than 2,900 square meters. When assigning tasks, Zhao Jingqi, the director of the construction office, repeatedly called on everyone to use their brains and shorten the construction period. This call excited Wang Sunci, who thought: "I should find a way to shorten the construction period." When he was formulating the construction plan, he remembered the problem that bricklaying and concrete projects could not be carried out simultaneously. He felt that the past method of operation should be reformed, and a new method should be used to enable the bricklaying project and the concrete project to be carried out simultaneously. How can they be carried out simultaneously? He carefully studied the engineering design, repeatedly pondered the detailed construction drawings, familiarized himself with the entire construction drawings, calculated the operation time of each type of work and process, and finally came up with a segmentation method: divide the building project into two sections for construction. This will allow the bricklaying project and the concrete project to be staggered, so that the bricklaying project avoids the concrete project. He assumed that the bricklayers would first lay bricks in Section A of the first floor, and after finishing, immediately move to Section B of the first floor, giving way to Section A of the first floor for the concrete project to work here. He also assumed that when the bricklayers finished laying bricks in Section B of the first floor, it was exactly the time when the concrete project in Section A of the first floor was completed, so the bricklayers could move to Section A of the second floor, and the concrete project could also move to Section B of the first floor. Such segmentation can make the bricklaying project and the concrete project staggered, without interfering with each other, and both can be carried out simultaneously.

　　The Skeptics No Longer Make a Sound

Wang Sunci used his segmented assembly line method to rearrange the construction progress, greatly shortening the construction period. Originally, it was stipulated that it would take 120 days to build this building, but now, after Wang Sunci's calculation, it would only take 60 days to build this building.

Wang Sunci put forward a plan to complete the task in 60 days. At that time, many construction site directors and technicians thought it was a joke, bragging, and impossible. Some older technicians said contemptuously: "Wang Sunci is only thirty years old, a young man with no experience, and he's talking big. He'll make a fool of himself! We'll wait and see." Indeed, from their experience, building a building with more than 2,900 square meters in 60 days—this was something they had never heard of.

After listening to Wang Sunci's report, Director Zhao Jingqi believed that Wang Sunci's method was good and could definitely be realized. Zhao Jingqi personally worked on the site for half a month, specifically helping Wang Sunci, supporting Wang Sunci, and encouraging Wang Sunci to move forward boldly. Wang Sunci's plan was indeed realized. On August 10, the building was completed. The actual construction period was only fifty-five days. Those who doubted, opposed, and waited to see a joke were silent in front of the completed building and no longer made a sound.

On August 12, Wang Sunci accepted a new task and began to build a second three-story building of the same size. He felt that there was still a waste of time when formulating the plan for the first building. In practice, he realized that there was still great potential to shorten the construction period. After he calculated the amount of work for the second building, he was sure that the bricklaying time could be reduced. He used the principle of the segmented assembly line method to repeatedly arrange the progress of the bricklaying project on the drawings, and also realized the principle that concentrating labor can speed up the speed. Therefore, based on this principle, and under the conditions permitted by technology, he further divided the building into three sections, A, B, and C, for construction. In this way, the number of bricks borne by the bricklayers in each section was relatively reduced compared to when it was divided into two sections, and the speed of bricklaying by the bricklayers would inevitably be accelerated. He checked the number of bricks in each section and estimated the possibility that the bricklayers could further improve the bricklaying efficiency. He calculated that the bricklayers could finish laying bricks in each section in only two and a half days. One floor is divided into three sections. It only takes seven and a half days to build a floor.

　　The "Overlap Method" That Doesn't Waste a Minute

The method of bricklayers building a floor in seven and a half days was available. However, when he arranged the relationship between the two processes of bricklaying and concrete engineering, a problem occurred, namely: the bricklayers completed the bricklaying projects in sections B and C in five days, and wanted to return to section A, but at this time the concrete project in section A was not completed, because the concrete project could not be completed in one section in five days. Under this new situation, the contradiction between these two processes reappeared. How to solve it? Only by shortening the construction period of the concrete project so that it can be completed in five days. However, the concrete curing period must be at least three days. In addition, it is impossible to complete the three projects of setting up the model board, tying the steel bars, and pouring the cement in two days. So what should I do? Wang Sunci calculated for a long time, and he came up with another rule. As long as the first process tries to create the conditions needed for the second process as early as possible and lays the foundation for the second process as early as possible, the speed can be accelerated. Under the conditions permitted by technology, he stipulated that when bricklayers lay bricks in the first section, they should first concentrate their efforts on building the places needed for carpenters to set up model boards, so that carpenters can set up model boards earlier; carpenters should also first concentrate their efforts on setting up the places needed for steel bar workers to tie steel bars; similarly, steel bar workers must first tie up a place so that concrete workers can pour cement here earlier. Because each type of work and process is carried out so compactly, the concrete project is inserted into the first section for operation while the bricklayers are still laying bricks in the first section. When the bricklayers complete the bricklaying projects in sections B and C and return to section A, the concrete project has just been completed. Wang Sunci called this method the "overlap method." Using this "overlap method," it takes exactly seven and a half days to build a floor. In this calculation, Wang Sunci further enriched the content of the segmented assembly line method: He believed that with work experience, one must also be able to calculate time and not let time slip away from the gaps in work. In his opinion, time is not an abstract concept. Time is the solidification of concrete, the end of a piece of work and the beginning of another, the rise of one floor and two floors, the number of times of carrying ash and the sound of grouting. … As long as you use advanced scientific methods to calculate time, you can save time and not lag behind.

　　Forty Days to Completely Build a Building

Some people don't think so. They cling to the old methods, follow the old steps step by step, waste time, are left behind by the wheels of time, and complain that the wheels are rolling too fast. When I visited Wang Sunci's construction zone, I saw a three-story building also being built on the south side of this construction zone. This building is about the same size as Wang Sunci's, but the construction period is more than 100 days. It turned out that the construction site director of this building did not adopt the segmented assembly line method and rigidly calculated the construction period according to the flat push operation method, resulting in a construction period more than doubled compared to Wang Sunci's building. When Wang Sunci started to build the first building, this building had already started construction for a few days. Now, the construction site director of this building knows: "The construction period is too tight, and we have to hurry up. If we had adopted the segmented assembly line method earlier, the building would have been built long ago."

I stood in Wang Sunci's construction zone and saw the workers building the third floor on the second floor of the second building. Director Zhao Jingqi told me: "It takes seven and a half days to build a floor. It takes twenty-two and a half days to build three floors. In addition, it takes five and a half days to do the foundation project, and twelve days to remove the model boards and plaster. In total, it takes forty days. This second building will be completely built in forty days." Wang Sunci held the construction progress schedule and said with a smile: "As long as the materials are supplied in time, the construction period of forty days can be further shortened!"

Using the segmented assembly line method, workers continuously do one kind of work without stopping or interrupting, which can also improve the level of technical proficiency and ensure the quality of the project. Workers do not stop working and no longer move around as in the past, so they can work with peace of mind and are easy to organize. The segmented assembly line method does not allow uncoordinated phenomena to occur between processes and does not allow any process to lag behind, thus establishing the collectivist thinking of construction workers. Workers know: "If my process falls behind, it will affect the progress of all processes. We can't affect everyone!"

The segmented assembly line method created by Wang Sunci has been effective in the Soviet Union for a long time. Wang Sunci did not see the article introducing the segmented assembly line method in the Soviet Union, but he found this operation method based on his own experience. I visited Wang Sunci, and I felt that every minute our motherland is producing new people and new things.

    七天半修好一层楼
    ——访问创造分段流水作业法的王孙慈
    陈迹
    谁见过王孙慈，谁就会感到他是细心的、刻苦钻研的、头脑很精密的人。他非常热爱自己的工作，一心想在工作上多有一些成就。他认为不钻研自己的工作，就是不负责任；满足已有的成就，就是自愿落后。他是福建人，学徒出身，没进过大学，没读过多少书。现在他已成了工地主任，领导哈尔滨东北电工局工程处第三工区的施工工作。
    发现了问题
    一九五零年，他从福建来到东北，担任电工局某工厂基本建设科的技术检查工作。他一到东北，就感到东北的施工日期太短，在一年内只有半年时间能够盖房子。“哎呀！施工期这么短呀！在福建一年可以做完的工程，搬到东北来做，就得要两年啦！”有一次，他在沈阳某工程现场，发现所有瓦工都停了工，眼睁睁地等待着混凝土工程竣工后才能向混凝土地板上砌砖。王孙慈心里暗暗想：这不能改变吗？为什么砌砖工程和混凝土工程就不能同时作业呢？东北施工期这么短，这样等下去，是应该的吗？这一连串的疑问，常常在他脑子里翻滚着。
        分段流水作业法的诞生
    今年年初，电工局成立了工程处，把王孙慈调来做哈尔滨第三工区的工地主任，负责一幢二千九百多平方公尺的三层楼房的修建工程。在分配任务时，工程处处长赵景琪一再号召大家开动脑筋，缩短工期。这个号召激动着王孙慈，王孙慈认为：“我应该想办法，缩短工期。”当他制订施工计划时，他又想起砌砖工程和混凝土工程不能同时作业的问题来了。他觉得应该改革过去的作业法，用一种新的方法来使砌砖工程和混凝土工程能够同时作业。怎样才能同时作业呢？他细心地研究了工程设计，一再地琢磨了施工详图，摸熟了整个施工图样，计算了各个工种、工序的作业时间，最后想出了分段的办法：把这座楼房工程分成两段，来进行施工。这样就可让砌砖工程和混凝土工程错开，使得砌砖工程躲开混凝土工程。他假定瓦工先在第一层楼甲段砌砖，砌好了，马上转到第一层楼乙段去，让出第一层楼甲段来，以便混凝土工程在这里作业。他又假定当瓦工在第一层楼乙段砌好砖的时候，正是第一层楼甲段的混凝土工程竣工的时候，瓦工就可转到第二层楼的甲段去，混凝土工程也可转到第一层楼乙段去。这样地分段，就能够使得砌砖工程和混凝土工程错开，互不妨碍，都能同时作业。
    怀疑的人们不再作声了
    王孙慈运用他的分段流水作业法，重新排列了工程进度。大大缩短了工期。原来规定修好这座楼房需要一百二十天，现在经过王孙慈的计算，修好这座楼只要六十天就行了。
    王孙慈提出了六十天完成任务的计划。当时，很多工地主任、技术人员认为这是笑话，这是吹牛，这是不可能的事情。某些年老的技术人员轻蔑地说道：“王孙慈只有三十岁，年轻小伙子没啥经验，还说大话。他这样地干，笑话在后面哩！我们等着瞧吧。”的确，从他们的经验看来，六十天修好一幢两千九百多平方公尺的楼房——这是他们从来就没听说过的事情。
    赵景琪处长听取了王孙慈的报告之后，认为王孙慈的办法好，一定可以实现。赵景琪亲自到现场工作了半个月，专门帮助王孙慈，支持王孙慈，鼓励王孙慈大胆前进。王孙慈的计划果然实现了。八月十日，这座楼房竣工了。实际工期只有五十五天。怀疑的，反对的，看笑话的人们在修好了的这幢楼房面前，默默无言，不再作声了。
    八月十二日，王孙慈接受了新的任务，开始修建第二幢同样大小的三层楼房。他觉得在制订第一幢楼房时，时间还有浪费。在实践中，他认识到缩短工期的可能性还很大。当他计算了这第二幢楼房的工程数量以后，他肯定砌砖的时间还可以减少。他运用分段流水作业法的原理，在图纸上翻覆地排列砌砖工程的进度，又发觉到集中地使用劳动力可以加快速度的道理。于是根据这个道理，在技术条件许可下，又把这幢楼房进一步地分成甲乙丙三段来施工。这样，在每个段内瓦工所担负的砌砖数目就比分成两段时要相对地减少了，瓦工砌砖的速度势必加快。他核算每一段的砖数，又估计瓦工还能提高砌砖效率的可能，他算出了瓦工在每段只用两天半时间就能砌好砖。一层楼为三段。砌好一层楼，总共只要七天半。
    不浪费一分钟的“搭接法”
    瓦工在七天半内砌好一层楼的办法有了。但在他按排砌砖工程和混凝土工程这两个工序间的关系时，发生了一个问题，即：瓦工在五天内做好乙、丙两段的砌砖工程，要转回甲段来，但是这时候甲段的混凝土工程没有竣工，因为混凝土工程在一个段内五天不能完成。在这种新的情况下，这两个工序间的矛盾又出现了。怎么解决呢？只有缩短混凝土工程的工期，使它在五天内能够完成。但是混凝土保养期至少要三天，此外立模型板，扎钢筋，打洋灰这三个工程在两天内怎样也不能完成。那么怎么办呢？王孙慈计算了很久，他又想出一条规律，只要第一工序尽量地先创造第二工序所需要的条件，为第二工序早日打下基础，就可以加快速度。在技术条件许可的情况下，他规定瓦工在第一段砌砖时，先集中力量砌好木工立模型板所需要的地方，以便木工能提早立模型板；木工也先要集中力量，立好钢筋工扎钢筋所需要的地方；同样的，钢筋工也必须先扎好一块地方，以便混凝土工提早在这里打洋灰。由于各工种、工序这样紧凑地进行作业，因之在瓦工还在第一段砌砖时，混凝土工程就插进第一段进行作业。当瓦工做好乙、丙两段砌砖工程，转回甲段时，混凝土工程刚刚竣工。王孙慈把这个方法叫做“搭接法”。运用这个“搭接法”，修好一层楼，正好是七天半。在这次计算中，王孙慈进一步丰富了分段流水作业法的内容：他认为有了工作经验，还必须会计算时间，不要让时间从工作的漏缝中跑掉了。在他看来，时间不是抽象的概念。时间是混凝土的凝固，是一段工作的结束和另一段工作的开始，是一层楼两层楼的上升，是挑灰的次数和灌浆的声音。……只要你运用先进的科学的方法来计算时间，你就能争取时间，不会落伍了。
    四十天全部修好一幢楼
    有些人却不这样，他们死抱着陈旧的方法不放，墨守成规地按照旧步伐前进，浪费了时间，被时间的车轮甩在后面，还埋怨车轮滚得太快。当我去访问王孙慈的工区时，我看见在这个工区的南面也在建筑着一幢三层楼房。这幢楼房和王孙慈的差不多大，但工期却是一百多天。原来建筑这幢楼房的工地主任没有采用分段流水作业法，死板地按着平推作业法计算工期，结果比王孙慈的楼房的工期多了一倍多。在王孙慈开始修筑第一幢房时，这幢楼房已开工了几天。现在，这幢楼房的工地主任才知道：“施工期太紧啦，还得赶快干。如果早采用分段流水作业法，楼房早就修好了。”
    我站在王孙慈的工区里，看见工人们正在第二幢楼房的第二层楼上，修筑第三层楼。赵景琪处长告诉我：“修好一层楼是七天半。修好三层楼是二十二天半。此外做基础工程是五天半，拆模型板、抹灰是十二天。加起来，一共四十天。四十天就完全修好这第二幢楼。”王孙慈拿着施工进度表，笑眯眯地说道：“只要材料供应得上，四十天的工期还可缩短哩！”
    采用分段流水作业法，工人不停工、不间歇地连续地做着一种工作，还能提高技术熟练的程度，保证工程质量。工人不停工，不再像过去那样地到处流动，因之就能安心工作，易于组织起来。分段流水作业法不容许工序之间发生不协调的现象，不容许任何工序落后，因而也树立了建筑工人的集体主义的思想。工人们知道：“我这个工序落了后，就会影响所有的工序前进。我们不能影响大家呀！”
    王孙慈创造的这种分段流水作业法，在苏联早就行之有效了。王孙慈没看到介绍苏联的分段流水作业法的文章，他根据自己经验，找出了这个作业法。我访问了王孙慈，我感到每一分钟我们的祖国都在产生着新的人物，新的事物。
