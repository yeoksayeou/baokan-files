The health work in ethnic minority areas of Northwest China has achieved great results in the three years since the founding of the country.

Before liberation, the people of various ethnic minorities in Northwest China suffered from diseases for a long time. For example, in a village inhabited by Mongolians in Gongha County, Xinjiang Province, the population was about ten thousand households twenty years before liberation. Due to the spread of diseases year after year, it had been reduced to about three thousand households by the time of liberation. The Qunluo ethnic group (a branch of the Tibetan ethnic group) in Qinghai Province originally had more than two hundred households, but only thirty or so households were left at the time of liberation. Therefore, before liberation, a painful cry of "Often see mothers pregnant, but never see the children walk" was widely circulated among the people of various ethnic minorities in Northwest China.

After the complete liberation of the Northwest region in 1949, new changes began to take place in the health conditions of various ethnic minority areas. When the People's Liberation Army troops arrived in various ethnic minority areas, they dispatched a large number of medical and health personnel to provide free diagnosis and treatment for the people of ethnic minorities. In August 1950, when the Central Delegation arrived in the Northwest, it presented drugs and medical equipment worth 1.5 billion yuan to various ethnic minorities. Under the care of the Central and Northwest People's Governments at all levels, more than 230 health and medical institutions at all levels have been established and restored in ethnic minority areas of Northwest China in the past three years. The People's Government has also allocated more than 30 billion yuan in RMB for the exclusive purpose of providing free treatment to the people of ethnic minorities. The provincial people's governments not only dispatched a large number of Han Chinese health workers to work in ethnic minority areas, but also trained a group of ethnic minority health workers, so that the health and medical conditions of more than 6 million ethnic minority people in Northwest China have been initially improved.

Since 1950, the Northwest Military and Political Committee and the health and medical institutions of various provincial people's governments have dispatched more than 20 medical and health work teams in batches to go deep into pastoral and remote areas to carry out mobile prevention and treatment work. The staff of the medical teams often visited, diagnosed, and treated patients in various tents and families while carrying medicine bags under very harsh climatic conditions. According to incomplete statistics, more than 910,000 patients have been diagnosed and treated in the past three years, with an average cure rate of over 50 percent. While treating diseases for the people of ethnic minorities, the medical teams widely publicized common-sense scientific health knowledge in the languages of various ethnic groups, using pictures, songs, dances, slides, models, and other forms.

No major illnesses have occurred in ethnic minority areas of Northwest China in the past three years, and the original various diseases have also decreased year by year. Since the focus on preventing and treating venereal diseases began this year, 80 percent of patients in Linxia City and Xiahe County, Gansu Province, who have been suffering from venereal diseases for many years without a cure, have been cured. In Nanmentan Village, Datong County, Qinghai Province, the number of deaths due to diseases in 1951 decreased by 87.8 percent compared with 1950. As a result of the widespread vaccination of cowpox, cases of smallpox have been greatly reduced, and smallpox has been basically eliminated in some areas such as Xining City, Qinghai Province. Maternal and child health stations have been established in towns such as Xiahe County and Ningxia Province's Wuzhong City and Tongxin County, Xinjiang Province's Dihua City, and Qinghai Province's Shangwuzhuang, and the infant mortality rate has gradually decreased.

This summer, under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of various ethnic minority areas in Northwest China launched the patriotic health campaign, which further improved health conditions. Fifteen new-style midwifery stations were established in Ledu County, Qinghai Province, during the health campaign; Haian County also established health groups in Mongolian and Tibetan pastoral areas and agricultural areas, and trained 39 health workers in various "Dewa" (villages).

The people of various ethnic minorities in Northwest China have expressed their infinite gratitude to the People's Government for leading them on the road to health and happiness in the past three years. They praised: "Chairman Mao's 'Manba' (doctor) is our savior!" When the Seventh Detachment of the Central Anti-Epidemic Corps left Haiyan County, Qinghai Province, people of ethnic minorities saw them off for more than thirty miles along the way. The Tibetans who saw them off sang:
　　
　　Higher than the blue sky,
　　I hope the blue sky is bluer and brighter.
　　Wider than the "Hali Hua" grassland,
　　I hope the "Hali Hua" grassland is wider and longer.
　　The great people's savior, the Communist Party,
　　I hope you will always lead us forward.
　　The grace is heavier than our Chairman Mao,
　　I wish – Chairman Mao a long life!

    西北各少数民族地区的卫生工作三年来有很大成绩
    西北各少数民族地区的卫生工作，开国三年来已获得很大成绩。
    西北各少数民族人民，解放前曾长期遭受着疾病的痛苦。如新疆省巩哈县蒙族人民聚居的一个村庄，在解放前二十年，人口约一万多户，由于疾病连年蔓延，临解放时已减少到约三千户；青海省群裸族（藏族的一支族）原有二百多户，解放时也只剩下三十多户。因此解放前在西北各少数民族人民中普遍地流传着“常见娘怀儿，不见儿走路”的沉痛呼声。
    一九四九年西北地区全部解放后，各少数民族地区的卫生状况开始发生了新的变化。人民解放军各部队到达各少数民族地区时，便派出大批医务卫生人员免费给少数民族人民诊治疾病。一九五零年八月中央访问团到达西北时，又以价值十五亿元的药品及医疗器材赠送给各少数民族。在中央和西北各级人民政府的关怀下，三年来西北各少数民族地区建立和恢复了各级卫生医疗机构二百三十多处。人民政府并先后拨发人民币三百多亿元，专为少数民族人民免费治疗之用。各省人民政府不但派遣了大批汉族卫生工作干部到少数民族地区工作，而且已经培养了一批各少数民族卫生工作干部，使西北地区六百多万少数民族人民的卫生医疗条件有了初步改善。
    西北军政委员会和各省人民政府卫生医疗机构，从一九五零年起，曾分批派出二十多个医疗卫生工作队，深入牧区和边远地区进行巡回防治工作。医疗队的工作人员常在很恶劣的气候条件下，背着药包到各个帐篷和家庭中去访问、治病。三年来据不完全的统计，共诊治病人九十一万多人，治愈率平均在百分之五十以上。各医疗队在为少数民族人民治病同时，以各民族的文字、语言和采用画片、歌舞、幻灯、模型等形式，广泛宣传通俗的科学卫生常识。
    西北各少数民族地区三年来没有发生大的病患，原有的各种疾病也逐年减少。今年开始重点防治性病以来，甘肃省临夏市和夏河县城两地人民中多少年来无法治好的性病患者，已有百分之八十获得痊愈。青海省大通县南门摊村一九五一年因疾病死亡的人数，较一九五零年减少了十分之八点七。因普遍施种牛痘的结果，天花病例已大大减少，青海省西宁市等若干地区已基本上消灭了天花。甘肃省夏河县和宁夏省吴忠市、同心县，新疆省迪化市和青海省上五庄等城镇，都成立了妇幼保健站，婴儿死亡率已经逐渐降低。
    今年夏天，西北各少数民族地区的人民，在人民政府领导下开展了爱国卫生运动，使卫生状况获得了进一步的改善。青海省乐都县在卫生运动中成立了十五个新法接生站；海晏县在蒙族、藏族牧区和农业区还建立起卫生小组，并在各个德哇（村）训练了三十九个卫生员。
    西北各少数民族人民对于人民政府三年来领导他们走向康乐的道路，都表示无限的感激，他们盛赞：“毛主席的满巴（医生），是我们的救命恩人！”中央防疫总队第七大队离开青海省海晏县时，沿途三十多里都有少数民族人民送行。送行的藏民们歌唱道：
    高不过蓝天，
    我希望蓝天更蓝更亮。
    宽不过“哈里华”草原，
    我希望“哈里华”草原更宽更长。
    伟大的人民救星共产党，
    我希望你永远领导我们前进。
    恩典重不过我们的毛主席，
    我祝福——毛主席万寿无疆！
