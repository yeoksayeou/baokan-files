The safety and health inspection work in factories affiliated to the East China Industrial Department has now basically concluded. Currently, factories have begun to enter the democratic general inspection of production management.

This movement began in mid-July. Throughout the movement, the leadership of the East China Industrial Department firmly grasped the policy of mobilizing the masses to raise problems and relying on the masses to solve them, as well as the leadership method of mobilizing and solving simultaneously. It also selected four key factories, organized leading cadres to go deep into the factories, and personally carried out inspections. In the later stage of the movement, it promptly instructed factories to mobilize the masses to put forward rationalization proposals to solve various problems in the safety and health inspection. Therefore, the development of the movement was normal and healthy, and great achievements were made.

First, this movement enhanced the understanding of safety and health work among leaders and the masses, laying a good foundation for regular safety and health work in the future. In the early stage of the movement, some cadres had complacency, and employees had paralysis. Later, through the education of specific facts discovered in the inspection, they were overcome. For example, when Tianyuan and Tianli Chemical Plants inspected the hydrochloric acid furnace, they found a three-inch-long crack in the quartz tube. If air penetrated into the furnace through the crack, an explosion could occur. This shocked all employees and changed their views.

Second, the factory's safety and health equipment has been basically improved. According to the statistics of 46 factories, employees put forward a total of 41,540 opinions on improving safety and health work, of which 13,329 were solved by employees themselves. For those that needed leadership to solve, the factories earnestly handled all those that urgently needed to be solved and did not require design or could be handled in a short time. Specific plans were also made for those that needed to be solved regularly, and they were assigned to relevant departments to be completed on schedule. The East China Industrial Department allocated or approved a total of 32.05 billion yuan for safety and health equipment for various factories. Now, the ventilation equipment, machine protection, factory building and machine maintenance, and the addition of sanitary equipment in various factories have been greatly improved, and the sanitary conditions have also been greatly improved.

In addition, the inspection also improved the relationship between leaders and the masses and promoted production. In the lime department of Tianyuan and Tianli Chemical Plants, in the past, workers had difficulty breathing because of lime dust. This time, work clothes were issued, and large pipes for conveying fresh air were buried. The workers' work enthusiasm was improved, creating a new record of 9,300 jin of hydrated lime per shift. In order to consolidate the achievements, 18 factories, including Shanghai Chemical Plant, have initially established more specific safety operation procedures and maintenance, inspection, and cleaning systems.

### 华东工业部所属各厂  安全卫生检查工作基本结束

    华东工业部所属各厂
    安全卫生检查工作基本结束
    华东工业部所属各厂的安全卫生检查工作，现已基本结束。目前各厂已开始进入生产管理民主大检查。
    这次运动自七月中旬开始。在整个运动中，华东工业部领导方面紧紧掌握了发动群众提出问题、依靠群众解决问题的方针和边发动、边解决的领导方法，并选择了四个重点厂，组织领导干部深入工厂，亲自动手检查。在运动后期，又及时指示各厂发动群众提出合理化建议，解决安全卫生大检查中的各种问题。因此，运动的发展是正常与健康的，并得到了很大成绩。
    首先，这次的运动提高了领导与群众对安全卫生工作的认识，为今后经常性的安全卫生工作打下了良好基础。运动初期，部分干部存在着自满情绪，职工中有麻痹思想，后通过检查中所发现的具体事实的教育，都被克服了。如天原、天利电化厂在检查盐酸炉时，发现石英管有三寸长的裂痕，如果空气通过裂痕透进炉子，即可能发生爆炸。这使全体职工大吃一惊，改变了看法。
    其次，基本上改善了工厂安全卫生设备。据四十六个厂的统计，职工提出改善安全卫生工作的意见共达四万一千五百四十条，其中由职工自己动手解决的有一万三千三百二十九条。对于需要领导上解决的，凡属于迫切需要解决又不需要设计或不需很长时间即可处理的，各厂都认真的作了处理。需要定期解决的，也都作出具体计划，分交有关科室按期完成。华东工业部共拨发或批准各厂安全卫生设备经费三百二十亿五千万元。现在，各厂的通风设备、机器保护、厂房和机器的检修，以及添置卫生设备等各方面，有了很大的改善，卫生条件也大大改观。
    此外，通过检查，还改善了领导与群众的关系，推动了生产。天原、天利电化厂石灰部，过去因为石灰飞扬，工人呼吸困难，这次制发了工作衣，埋了输送新鲜空气的大管子，工人工作情绪提高，创造了每班水化石灰九千三百斤的新纪录。为了巩固成绩，上海化工厂等十八个厂已初步建立了比较具体的安全操作规程和检修、检查、清洁卫生等制度。
