    China and India are the two largest countries in Asia. The combined population of these two countries accounts for more than half of the total population of all countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which is about two-fifths of the world's population. Both nations are among the nations in the world with a long history and brilliant culture. The people of both countries are also outstanding, diligent, hardworking, and creative people. China, in its recorded five thousand years of history, has produced many great thinkers and writers. The artistic achievements of the Chinese people have reached a high level, and they have also made many significant inventions in science, making indelible contributions to the development of human culture. India already had a remarkable culture in the third millennium BC. The Indian people have had their glorious achievements whether in philosophy or in literature and art. In addition to China and India, the two largest nations in Asia, other Asian nations have also made important contributions to the promotion of world civilization.

    Two great nations like China and India, with rich cultural heritage and abundant natural resources, coupled with the wisdom and diligence of their people, could have created a happy and prosperous life for themselves long ago. However, the long-term feudal exploitation system hindered economic and cultural development. For centuries, especially in the last hundred years, the imperialist colonial system has brought serious disasters to the people of Asia, causing the excellent culture of almost every Asian nation to be devastated and persecuted. In order to facilitate the exploitation and enslavement of the Asian people, the imperialist colonists have exhausted all kinds of vicious means to distort the history of Asian nations, causing the oppressed nations to despise their own cultural achievements and making people believe that Asian nations are "culturally backward and intellectually foolish" and that the Asian people are people who should be exploited and enslaved. On the other hand, imperialism carried out cruel oppression and ruthless exploitation and plunder, driving the vast working people living in areas with fertile land and abundant underground resources to live a poor and difficult life. The imperialist colonists have thus written the ugliest chapter in human history. Even today, imperialists are still trying to maintain this piratical colonial system.

    However, the Asian people have never yielded in this tragic situation. They not only hate the life under imperialist oppression, but also have been engaged in and are still engaged in constant struggles to win national independence. Since the invasion of Asia by imperialism, this struggle has never stopped. As long as the imperialist forces exist in Asia, this struggle for national independence will never stop. Precisely because of this, the Chinese and Indian people have a common and profound understanding of the meaning of peace, that is, peace must be built on the foundation of national independence, otherwise there is no point in talking about peace. This understanding has been confirmed by all peace-loving people in the world.

    The anti-imperialist national independence struggle will inevitably be victorious, and the forces of peace will inevitably become stronger and stronger with the continuous victory of this struggle. The peoples of the Asian countries that have been liberated, especially the liberated Chinese people, have provided a glorious and powerful example of the inevitability of this victory. Once the Chinese people were freed from the shackles of imperialism, they immediately presented a new atmosphere, not only rapidly improving the people's material living standards, but also improving the people's moral and cultural standards. The decadent and corrupt ideas and culture instilled by imperialism in the past have gradually been eliminated or no longer exist. Happy people are using their strength and wisdom in the land of democracy and freedom to engage in various peaceful constructions for their true happiness. The amazing achievements and rapid progress in all aspects in this short period are enough to show the infinite power of the liberated people of Asia, who can not only create conditions for a happy life for themselves, but also directly affect world civilization.

    In contrast, a small group of war mongers who are engaged in destroying the cause of world civilization not only make extensive use of the reactionary newspapers, vulgar books, pornographic films, and radio broadcasts that are constantly distorting facts and fabricating rumors that they control to spread and disseminate their cultural and spiritual toxins, and carry out their war policy of destroying international peace; and they also embezzle the achievements of science to prepare for atomic weapons, chemical and bacteriological warfare; in fact, the latter two weapons have been used madly. Scientists' laboratories and scientific research institutions have become places for experimenting and manufacturing tools for mass slaughter of mankind! This act of destroying civilization and desecrating science, compared with the peaceful people's use of culture and science in construction projects for human safety and happiness, is precisely a clear contrast between evil and civilization.

    The two routes of evil and civilization are becoming clearer and clearer. The people of China and India have suffered from the pain and suffering brought by the imperialists, and they are familiar with the boundaries between evil and civilization. We understand how evil is produced by various forms of military oppression and economic exploitation. Facts tell us that true civilization can only be obtained in peaceful lands and peaceful days. The lessons of history have made us deeply aware that peace cannot be waited for, but needs to be strived for, constantly strived for, and needs to unite all peace-loving people to strive for it together.

    The people of China and India are peace-loving. Since the beginning of the peace movement, they have been carrying out extensive activities to defend and strive for peace. Just as the security and peace of the Asia-Pacific region are facing more direct threats, at the suggestion of the Indian people and initiated by the Chinese people, the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will be held in Beijing in September this year as decided by the preparatory meeting. This conference is not only jointly demanded by the people of all countries in the Asia-Pacific region, but also unanimously hoped for by all peace-loving people in the world. Now that this conference of great significance is about to be held in Beijing, the Indian people are welcoming the arrival of this conference with the same unparalleled enthusiasm as the Chinese people.

    On the eve of the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, the Indian people are actively launching preparations for participating in the conference. Under the initiative of the All-India Peace Council, an All-India Committee for preparing for participation in the conference was established, and all important people's organizations and important representatives of different opinions were invited to participate in this preparatory committee. The full text of the declaration of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference has been published by many newspapers across India. Many famous people who are working hard for the cause of peace in India and the representatives who returned from Beijing after attending the preparatory meeting are giving speeches or writing articles to carry out publicity work, clearly pointing out the great significance of the conference. The spirit and purpose of the conference have been spreading all over India. Not long ago, "Asia Week" was held and regional peace conferences were convened in various parts of India. During this period, people from all walks of life actively participated in various mass rallies and parades. The speeches made at the rallies, regardless of their political views and religious beliefs, unanimously reflected the Indian people's desire for peace, and expressed welcome and support for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference. In addition, they also focused on discussing the issue of ending the wars in Asia. They are concerned about the war being waged in Asia to suppress the people of Malaya, the war to attack the people of Vietnam, and the most brutal war of aggression against the Korean people. This concern is also the concern of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world.

    The colonists and war mongers of the imperialist countries, after suffering strong counterattacks in the several wars they launched in Asia, are not reconciled to their destined failure in Asia, and are still setting up military bases everywhere and gathering cannon fodder. The United States is intensifying its efforts to revive Japanese militarism, making the people of the Asia-Pacific region feel the threat of the revival of Japanese militarism, and at the same time, it will also bring another war disaster to the Japanese people. The people of China and India are unanimously and resolutely opposed to the remilitarization of Japan, and strongly support the Japanese people's struggle for peace, democracy and freedom.

    Following the regional conferences held in various parts of India, the All-India Sponsors Conference of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference was held in the capital of India on the 9th of this month, and the Third All-India Peace Congress was also held on the 12th. We firmly believe that due to the thorough and extensive preparations and promotion by Indian peace-loving people in advance, and due to the enthusiastic participation and support of the broad masses of the people, various valuable suggestions and methods that can promote the cause of peace will inevitably be generated at this All-India Sponsors Conference and the All-India Peace Congress. Indian representatives will soon come to our capital with the peace aspirations of the people of India under our warm expectation. What a pleasant thing this is!

    The peace of Asia is primarily of concern to the people of Asian countries. The Chinese and Indian people, as the two largest countries in Asia, should unite closely to strive for peace in Asia. The heat wave of peace is rising with the arrival of this Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference in India. The Indian people's call for peace has become louder and more powerful. The Indian people have fully demonstrated their great potential in engaging in the peace movement. It is obvious that this huge force, combined with the strength of the Chinese people and the people of other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, will become an irresistible torrent. The friendship between China and India has been continuously developed on the basis of peace and friendship. This ever-growing friendship and unity between the people of the two great countries, and their common desire for peace, will be an important reliance for the peace of the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

    增进中印友好，保卫亚洲与世界的和平
    中印友好协会会长  丁西林
    中国和印度是亚洲两个最大的国家，这两个国家的人口加在一起，占亚洲及太平洋区域各国人口总数的一半以上，也就是约占全世界人口总数的五分之二。两国的民族同是世界上具有悠久历史和灿烂文化的民族。两国的人民也都是出色的勤恳、耐劳和富有创造力的人民。中国，在它有记载的五千年历史中曾产生了不少伟大的思想家和文学家。中国人民在艺术上的造就曾达到高度的水准，在科学方面也有过多种的重大发明，对人类文化的发展作了不可磨灭的贡献。印度在公元前三千年已经有了卓越的文化。印度人民无论是在哲学上或是在文学艺术上都有他们的辉煌成就。除了中国和印度这两个亚洲最大的民族之外，其他的亚洲民族也都各有其对促进世界文明的重要贡献。
    像中国和印度这样两个伟大的民族，既有丰富的文化遗产，又有天然的富源，加上人民的智慧与勤劳，本来早就可以为自己创造美满幸福的生活，可是长期的封建剥削制度阻碍了经济与文化的发展。几世纪以来，特别是近百年来，帝国主义殖民制度又给亚洲人民带来严重的灾难，使几乎亚洲每一个民族的优秀文化横遭摧残和迫害。帝国主义的殖民者为了便于剥削和奴役亚洲人民，曾用尽种种恶毒的手段，歪曲亚洲各民族的历史，使被压迫的民族鄙视自己的文化成就，使人们相信亚洲民族是“文化落后，资质愚蠢”的民族，亚洲人民是应该被剥削被奴役的人民。另一方面，帝国主义则进行残酷的压迫和无情的剥削与掠夺，驱使生在土地肥沃、地下蕴藏丰富地区的广大劳动人民过着穷苦艰难的生活。帝国主义的殖民者就是这样在人类历史上写下了最丑恶的一章。直到今天，帝国主义者仍妄想把这种海盗式的殖民制度继续维持下去。
    然而，亚洲人民在这种悲惨的境遇里，从来没有屈服过；不仅对于帝国主义压迫下的生活感到痛恨，而且为了争取民族的独立曾经进行并仍在进行不断的斗争。自从帝国主义侵入亚洲以来，这种斗争从没有停止过，只要帝国主义势力在亚洲存在一日，这种为民族独立而进行的斗争也永不会停止。正因为如此，中国人民和印度人民对于和平的意义，是有一个共同的深刻的了解的，那就是和平必须建筑在民族独立的基础上，不然就谈不到和平。这种了解已为世界上一切爱好和平的人民所确信。
    反帝国主义的民族独立斗争必然胜利，和平的力量也必然随着这斗争的不断胜利而愈来愈强大。亚洲已经解放了的各国人民，尤其是解放了的中国人民已为这种胜利的必然性，提供了光荣而有力的例证。中国人民一经从帝国主义的枷锁中解脱出来，即刻呈现出新的气象，不仅迅速地提高了人民的物质生活水准，并提高了人民的道德与文化水准。以往帝国主义所灌输的堕落腐化的思想和文化已逐渐消除或已不复存在。欢乐的人民在民主自由的土地上，发挥了自己的力量和智慧，为了自己真正的幸福从事各种和平建设。在这短短的期间内，各方面惊人的成绩和飞跃的进展，都足以说明亚洲已经解放了的人民的无穷力量，非但能为自身创造幸福生活的条件，而且直接影响世界的文明。
    与此相反，正在从事于破坏世界文明事业的一小撮战争贩子，不但大量利用其所掌握的反动的报纸、下流的读物、黄色电影和始终在歪曲事实捏造谣言的广播等各式各样的宣传工具，来散布和传播其文化和精神上的毒素，进行其破坏国际和平的战争政策；并且盗用科学的成果，来准备原子武器、化学和细菌武器的战争；事实上后两项武器已被疯狂地使用着。科学家的实验室和科学研究机构已变成了实验和制造集体屠杀人类的工具的场所！这种破坏文明，亵渎科学的行为，与爱好和平的人民将文化科学用在为人类谋安全和幸福的建设事业相比较，恰好成为一个罪恶与文明的鲜明的对照。
    罪恶与文明的两条路线愈来愈分得清楚了。中印两国人民饱受过帝国主义者带来的痛苦与惨祸，对于罪恶与文明的界限是熟知的。我们懂得罪恶是如何地由各种式样的武力压迫和经济榨取而产生出来，事实告诉我们，只有在和平的土地上，和平的日子里才能得到真正的文明。历史的教训更使我们深知和平不能坐待，而是需要争取，不断的争取，并且需要团结一切爱好和平的人民大家起来争取才能得到的。
    中印两国人民是热爱和平的，自从和平运动开始以来，就一直为保卫和平、争取和平展开了广泛的活动。正当亚洲及太平洋区域的安全与和平遭受更直接威胁的时候，根据印度人民的建议，由中国人民发起筹备，并由筹备会议决定于今年九月在北京召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。这个会议，不但是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民所共同要求的，也是全世界爱好和平的人民所一致希望的。现在这个具有重大意义的会议即将在北京举行了，印度人民是和中国人民同样地以无比热烈的心情来迎接这一会议的来临。
    印度人民在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕的前夕，积极地展开参加会议的筹备工作。在全印和平理事会倡议下，成立了筹备参加会议事宜的全印委员会，一切重要的人民团体和各方面不同见解的重要代表人物都被邀请参加这个筹备委员会。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的宣言全文，已由印度全国许多报纸予以刊载。印度许多努力和平事业的著名人士以及由北京返国的参加筹备会议的代表们，或是演讲，或是著文，普遍地进行宣传工作，明确地指出会议的重大意义。会议的精神和宗旨已在印度全国各地到处传播着。不久以前，印度各地曾举行“亚洲周”和召开地区性的和平会议，在这个期间内，来自各个不同阶层的人民踊跃地参加各群众性的集会和游行。在集会中所发表的言论，不论他们的政治见解和宗教信仰如何，都一致反映出印度人民要求和平的热望，都表示欢迎和支持亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。除此之外，他们还着重地讨论了结束亚洲境内的战争问题，他们焦虑着在亚洲境内正在进行的镇压马来亚人民的战争，进攻越南人民的战争和对朝鲜人民最凶残的侵略战争。这种焦虑同样也是中国人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民的焦虑。
    帝国主义国家的殖民者和战争贩子们，在他们所发动的亚洲境内的几处战争中，遭到坚强的反击之后，并不甘心他们在亚洲已经注定的失败，还正在到处遍设军事基地，搜罗炮灰。美国并变本加厉地加速复活日本军国主义，使亚洲及太平洋区域的人民又感到日本军国主义复活的威胁，同时，也将给日本人民带来又一次战争的祸害。中印两国人民一致坚决反对使日本重新军国主义化，并且强力地支持日本人民争取和平民主与自由的斗争。
    继印度全国各地纷纷召开的地区性会议之后，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议全印赞助人会议已于本月九日在印度的首都召开，第三届全印和平大会也于十二日举行了。我们深信由于印度热心和平事业人士事先周密的广泛的准备和推动，由于广大人民群众的热烈参加和支持，在这次全印赞助人会议和全印和平大会上，必然地会产生一些足以促进和平事业的各种宝贵的建议和办法。印度代表们不久就将在我们热烈的期待下，带着全印人民和平的愿望来到我们的首都，这是何等愉快的事！
    亚洲的和平首先是为亚洲各国人民所关心的，作为亚洲的两个最大国家的中国人民及印度人民应该紧密团结起来争取亚洲的和平。和平的热浪在印度正随着这次亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的到来日益高涨。印度人民的和平呼声已越发响亮而有力。印度人民在从事和平运动中已充分表现出他们的巨大的潜力。显而易见，这支巨大的力量与中国人民和亚洲及太平洋区域其他各国人民的力量结合起来，将成为一股不可抗拒的巨流。中印两国的友谊已在和平友好的基础上获得不断的发展，这种不断增长的两个伟大国家人民的友谊和团结，以及他们对和平的共同愿望，将是亚洲及太平洋区域及世界和平重要的依靠。
