How We Lead the Construction of Democratic Regime
Lan Rongyu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian Provincial People's Government

    Over the past three years, the construction of democratic regime in Fujian Province has made significant progress. People's representative conferences at the provincial, county, municipal, and township levels have been convened. County and municipal people's representative conferences have generally been held eight or nine times, with people's representative conferences in seven counties and cities already exercising the functions and powers of people's congresses. Eighty-eight point eight percent of the townships throughout the province have elected township people's governments through people's representative conferences. District people's representative conferences have been widely held in Fuzhou City. Standing committees of county people's representative conferences and municipal consultative committees have been generally established and are being gradually improved. Thanks to the smooth progress of the construction of democratic regime, people's governments at all levels have closely united people from all walks of life, promoted various central tasks, and resolved pressing issues among the masses at various periods. In the first half of this year, people's representative conferences in all counties focused on spring plowing and production as their central topic. Extensive publicity was carried out before the meetings, and full discussions were held during the meetings. Labor models and high-yield farmers among the representatives were invited to make typical reports, exhibitions were held, and representatives were organized to visit county farms and model cultivated land, effectively implementing the policy of patriotic production increase and organization. This year, the proposals from the people's representative conferences increased by 30 percent compared to last year. According to statistics from fifty-four counties alone, more than 10,000 proposals were received, mainly concerning the people's demands for developing production and improving culture. People's governments in all counties have properly handled these proposals based on specific circumstances.

    The reason that the construction of democratic regime in Fujian Province has been able to achieve the above-mentioned results, from the leadership of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, are the following:

    First, the work of building the democratic government is combined with the central tasks of various periods. In the past three years, Fujian Province has combined the political construction work with the central tasks such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, land reform, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and increasing production and practicing economy. In April and May this year, Minhou and Changle counties convened people's representative conferences exercising the functions and powers of people's congresses, which was during the busy farming season. The people's governments of the two counties took launching the patriotic production increase movement as the central topic of the meeting, and conducted extensive and in-depth publicity and education among the masses, so that the broad masses knew before the meeting that they would elect the county head and decide on the county's production plan at this meeting. Therefore, the masses attached great importance to the election of representatives, and elected outstanding elements and production backbones with high prestige as representatives. During the meeting, the two counties exposed rumors about the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and criticized erroneous ideas such as "production has reached its peak" and "fear of standing out," so that the representatives understood the policy of the production increase movement and recognized the direction of organization. In this way, the people's representative conferences in the two counties not only elected the people's government, but also effectively promoted the patriotic production increase movement throughout the county. As for the township people's representative conferences, they often discussed production issues and put forward criticisms or suggestions to the township people's governments. Experience has proved that since the purpose of political construction work is to mobilize and unite all the people to jointly handle national and their own affairs, this work must be closely linked with the construction tasks in national defense, economy, culture, etc., and carried out simultaneously, rather than in isolation.

    Secondly, the competent department (the Department of Civil Affairs) took the initiative to seek the help and support of the leaders. Zhang Dingcheng, Chairman of the Provincial People's Government, attached great importance to the work of political construction. He personally participated in guiding the first session of the first All-Circles People's Representative Conference in Minhou County, and often instructed the Department of Civil Affairs on the principles and tasks of political construction, and often conducted education on democratic ideas for cadres at various meetings. However, because the leading comrades of the provincial party and government have heavy tasks, it is impossible for them to take care of the political construction work piece by piece. Therefore, the Department of Civil Affairs must actively report the situation of the construction of political power to the leading comrades, raise questions, and request instructions. For example, in the land reform movement at the end of 1950, we took the initiative to put forward the idea of strengthening the construction of political power in combination with land reform, advocating that the county people's representative conferences in the land reform areas should take land reform as the central topic, so that land reform would become a matter for all the people, and establish and improve the grassroots political power in the countryside during the land reform process. This opinion was approved by the leading comrades, and the Provincial People's Government issued "Instructions on Strengthening Democratic Political Construction in Combination with Land Reform." Subsequent facts proved that this policy and practice were correct. For example, at the first Provincial People's Congress, we put forward a proposal to strengthen democratic political construction, which was immediately adopted by the presidium and submitted to the conference for discussion, and was listed as one of the seven tasks this year. Facts have proved that as long as the civil affairs department can actively and timely discover problems and propose solutions, it can obtain the support of the leadership. The important instructions, circulars, summaries, plans, etc. related to political construction in Fujian Province are all issued by the Provincial People's Government in a unified manner, so that the problems can be raised comprehensively and thoughtfully, and all departments can be mobilized to do it together, so the effect is also greater.

    Third, actively conduct ideological education on political construction for leading cadres and civil affairs cadres of the lower-level people's governments, and correct various misunderstandings about the people's representative conferences in a timely manner. At first, the leading cadres of the people's governments in various parts of Fujian Province did not universally recognize that the people's representative conferences and the system of people's congresses are the basic systems of our country, or their understanding was not clear. We immediately used the county civil affairs section chiefs' meetings and the special commissioner office civil affairs section chiefs' meetings (these two types of meetings are held once a year) to educate the cadres and solve ideological problems. For example, after the People's Daily editorial on August 14, 1951, proposed that "counties that have not held people's representative conferences well must conduct self-criticism," we immediately notified the leading cadres of each county and city to seriously check. Then, we held a provincial civil affairs section chiefs' meeting, and invited the county heads of two counties with better and poorer political construction work to participate, and asked them to make reports and self-criticisms respectively, and then launched discussions, criticizing and correcting the more serious erroneous views on the functions and powers of the people's representative conferences and the complacent mood in the political construction work in the counties at that time. After this meeting, the counties paid more attention to the work of political construction, and could better combine with the central work when convening the people's representative conferences this year. The provincial civil affairs meeting held in July this year further resolved the various ideological concerns of some cadres about the people's representative conferences exercising the functions and powers of the people's congresses, and decided that the people's representative conferences in all counties and cities will generally exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses this year. In addition, we also regularly send cadres to various places to inspect the political construction work. The five working groups sent out in April and May this year participated in democratic political construction work and learned about the situation of the people's representative conferences in twelve counties and cities in four special commissioner offices including Fu'an, directly absorbed the experience of political construction work, and answered the questions raised by the lower levels.

    In addition, we also paid attention to the publicity of political construction work, and often wrote articles for newspapers and national news agencies, broadcast on the radio, and compiled and printed political construction newsletters, compilation of political construction materials, and cadre learning documents. When various departments of the Provincial People's Government convened meetings, we also attended to explain the relevant policies on political construction, so that everyone paid more attention to this work. We deeply feel that the more active and in-depth the publicity work is, the easier the work is to carry out.

    我们是怎样领导民主政权建设工作的
    福建省人民政府民政厅厅长　蓝荣玉
　　三年来，福建省的民主政权建设工作有显著的发展。省、县、市、乡各级人民代表会议均已召开，县、市人民代表会议大都开过八、九次，其中有七个县、市的人民代表会议已代行了人民代表大会的职权。全省百分之八十八点八的乡人民代表会议选举了乡人民政府。福州市普遍召开了区人民代表会议。县人民代表会议常务委员会和市协商委员会已普遍建立了并逐步健全起来。由于民主政权建设工作顺利开展，各级人民政府密切地团结了各界人民，推动了各项中心工作，解决了各时期群众中的迫切问题。今年上半年，各县人民代表会议均以春耕生产为中心议题，会前进行了广泛的宣传，会中进行了充分的讨论，并请代表中的劳动模范和丰产户作典型报告，举办展览会，组织代表参观县农场和模范耕地，有效地贯彻了爱国增产和组织起来的方针。今年人民代表会议的提案较去年增加了百分之三十。仅据五十四个县的统计，即收到提案一万多件，主要内容是人民要求发展生产，提高文化。对于这些提案，各县人民政府都根据具体情况作了妥善处理。
　　福建省的民主政权建设工作能够取得上述成绩，从省民政厅的领导上说，有以下几个原因。
　　第一，是把民主政权建设工作和各时期的中心工作结合起来进行。三年来，福建省在剿匪、反霸、土地改革、抗美援朝和增产节约等各项中心工作中，都结合进行了政权建设工作。今年四、五月间，闽侯、长乐两县召开代行人民代表大会职权的人民代表会议，正值农忙季节。两县的人民政府都以开展爱国增产运动为会议的中心议题，向群众进行了广泛深入的宣传教育，使广大群众会前都知道在这次会议上要选举县长，决定全县的生产计划。因此群众都很重视代表的选举工作，选出了有较高威信的优秀分子和生产骨干为代表。这两县在会议中揭破了有关对“三反”“五反”运动的谣言，批判了“生产到顶”、“怕冒尖”等错误思想，使代表懂得了增产运动的政策，认清了组织起来的方向。这样，两县的人民代表会议不但选举了人民政府，而且有效地推动了全县的爱国增产运动。至于乡人民代表会议，更是经常讨论生产问题，向乡人民政府提出批评或建议。经验证明：政权建设工作的目的既在发动和团结全体人民共同办理国家的和自己的事情，那么这一工作就必须和国防、经济、文化等各方面的建设任务密切联系起来，同时进行，而不能孤立进行。
　　其次，主管部门（民政厅）主动争取领导者的帮助与支持。省人民政府张鼎丞主席很重视政权建设工作，曾亲自参加指导闽侯县召开的首届第一次各界人民代表会议，并经常指示民政厅以建政工作的方针、任务，在各种会议上经常对干部进行民主思想的教育。但因省级党、政领导同志任务繁重，不可能对建政工作件件顾到，因此民政厅必须积极主动地向领导同志汇报政权建设工作的情况，提出问题，请求指示。如在一九五零年底土地改革运动中，我们主动提出结合土地改革加强政权建设的意见，主张进行土地改革地区的县人民代表会议应以土地改革为中心议题，使土地改革变成全体人民的事，并在土地改革过程中建立与健全乡村的基层政权。这一意见得到领导同志的同意，即由省人民政府发出“关于结合土地改革加强民主建政工作的指示”。以后的事实，证明这一方针与做法是正确的。又如在第一届省人民代表会议上，我们提出加强民主建政工作的提案，立即被主席团采纳，交付大会讨论后，列为今年七项任务之一。事实证明：只要民政部门能主动地及时发现问题，提出解决办法，就可以取得领导上的支持。福建省有关政权建设的重要指示、通报、总结、计划等都是由省人民政府统一发布的，这样既可使问题提得全面、周到，又能动员各部门共同去做，因而收效也较大。
　　第三，积极对下级人民政府领导干部和民政干部进行关于政权建设的思想教育，适时地纠正对人民代表会议的各种错误认识。福建省各地人民政府的领导干部，最初并没有普遍认识人民代表会议和人民代表大会制度是我们国家的基本制度，或者认识得不明确。我们即利用县民政科长会议和专署民政科长会议（这两种会议每年各开一次）对干部进行教育，解决思想问题。如一九五一年八月十四日人民日报社论提出“县人民代表会议没有开好的必须检讨”以后，我们即通报各县、市领导干部认真检查。接着又召开全省民政科长会议，吸收政权建设工作较好的和较差的两个县的县长参加，请他们分别作了报告和检讨，然后展开讨论，批判、纠正了当时各县较为严重的对人民代表会议职权的错误见解和政权建设工作中的自满情绪。经过这次会议，各县都更加重视政权建设工作，今年召开人民代表会议时就能更好地结合中心工作了。今年七月间召开的全省民政会议，又进一步解决了某些干部对人民代表会议代行人民代表大会职权的各种思想顾虑，决定今年各县、市人民代表会议普遍代行人民代表大会的职权。此外，我们还经常派干部到各地检查建政工作。今年四、五月间派出的五个工作组，在福安等四个专署十二个县、市参加民主建政工作并了解人民代表会议的情况，直接吸取了政权建设工作的经验，并解答了下级提出的问题。
　　此外，我们还注意了政权建设工作的宣传，经常为报纸和国家通讯社写稿，在电台广播，并编印了建政通报，建政资料汇辑和干部学习文件等。在省人民政府各部门召开会议时，我们还出席讲解有关政权建设的政策，使大家更重视这一工作。我们深深感到，宣传工作越主动，越深入，工作也越容易开展。
