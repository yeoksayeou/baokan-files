    Hold a Good North China Materials Exchange Conference to Greet National Day
    Li Zheren, Deputy Director of the Preparatory Committee for the Second North China Materials Exchange Conference

    In order to further develop materials exchange, prosper urban and rural economies, support the patriotic production increase and economy campaign in industry and agriculture, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, the second North China Materials Exchange Conference of this year has been decided to be held in Tianjin on September 25th. The conference is tentatively scheduled for two months, and will be extended if necessary.

    This conference is being held on the basis of the tremendous development of material exchange in North China over the past two years. From the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951, under the correct guidance of the central government, North China held two native product conferences. These two conferences promoted the widespread development of the material exchange movement throughout the region, selling a total of 7 billion jin of local and special products (equivalent to about one-quarter of the total grain production in North China at that time), which played a great role in increasing farmers' purchasing power, opening up markets for industrial products, increasing national fiscal revenue, strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, supporting the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, and shattering the so-called "embargo" and "blockade" of American imperialism. In October 1951, we also held a large-scale North China Urban-Rural Materials Exchange Exhibition in Tianjin, which conducted a large-scale, systematic, concrete, and vivid political education on urban-rural mutual assistance, the worker-peasant alliance, and patriotism for the broad masses of urban and rural people, and organized transactions worth more than 15 trillion yuan, promoting the further development of urban-rural material exchange. By June of this year, 90 percent of the contracts and agreements signed at the exhibition had been fulfilled. In May of this year, we also held a North China Materials Exchange Conference in Tianjin and actively participated in the materials exchange conferences of other major administrative regions. At the same time, provinces, cities, special districts, and counties also widely held small-scale material exchange conferences in various forms, such as department store conferences, mule and horse conferences, medicinal material conferences, and temple fairs. The total transaction volume was approximately 2 trillion yuan. This resulted in the basic completion of the sale of native products in North China by the end of June, and promoted the sale of large quantities of industrial and handicraft products, which played a positive role in reversing the sluggish market situation in North China at that time. Facts have shown that holding material exchange conferences in markets at all levels can expand the domestic sales of native products and industrial products, promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, and comprehensively revitalize the urban and rural economies, gradually strengthening the planning and organization of production and sales and reducing blindness. Therefore, it can be said that the material exchange conference is a good form of trade, planned and organized under the leadership of the state-owned economy in the New Democracy. Based on the above experience, the second North China Economic Conference in July of this year stipulated that North China should hold a material exchange conference twice a year in spring and autumn, and provinces and cities should widely hold various forms of small-scale material exchange conferences. This North China Materials Exchange Conference is being held in accordance with this regulation.

    The current economic situation is very favorable for holding this material exchange conference. First, through three years of efforts, various industries in North China have been largely restored and have partially exceeded their historical peak levels. Private industries have also greatly developed with the support of the state in various aspects. Agricultural production has also exceeded pre-war levels. The abundant harvest of autumn crops this year is already certain. At the same time, the price level in the whole region has moved from basic stability to complete stability. The overall price index for the whole region has decreased by about 5 percent this year, which is the result of the victory of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. The development of industrial and agricultural production, the complete stability of prices, and the balance and surplus of national fiscal revenue have created extremely favorable conditions for the further development of material exchange.

    Second, due to the above situation, coupled with the reduction of agricultural taxes, wage adjustments, the implementation of the subsidy system, and the increase in state construction investment, the purchasing power of urban and rural people has increased significantly. Taking July of this year as an example, the sales volume of cloth and general merchandise in North China increased by an average of 59 percent compared with the same period in 1951. It is estimated that the total purchasing power of urban and rural people in the whole region this year will increase by 16.3 percent compared with 1951. In the past, Chahar Province sold very few bicycles, but in August of this year, workers and cadres in various industrial and mining areas and government agencies ordered a total of 3,000 bicycles. At present, the variety and quantity of industrial products needed in rural areas have increased compared with last year, and the requirements for quality have also increased. For example, the sales volume of striped poplin cloth in Hebei from January to July this year exceeded 2.5 times the sales volume of the entire year last year. The supply and marketing cooperative of Tongxian Special District in Hebei Province sold more than 10,000 jin of sugar per month last year, and 30,000 jin per month this year; tea sales were 2,000 to 3,000 jin per month last year, and more than 10,000 jin per month this year; and sales of socks and towels increased by 4 to 6 times. The agricultural tool supply society and cooperative of Hebei Province sold more than 18,000 pieces of new-style agricultural tools such as walking plows, sprayers, corn threshers, weeding hoes, and weeding machines this year, exceeding the total sales volume of last year by 3 to 4 times. At the same time, due to the development of the patriotic health movement and the Qi Jianhua rapid literacy movement, the demand of the broad masses of farmers for cultural, educational, and sanitary products has also increased dramatically. The supply and marketing cooperative of Tongxian Special District sold 70 dozens of ostrich ink per month last year, and 180 dozens per month recently; it sold 4,000 boxes of chalk per month last year, and 30,000 boxes per month recently. Fountain pens priced at 10,000 to 30,000 yuan each sell very well in rural areas, and sales of DDT, sanitary napkins, medicines, and other sanitary products have greatly increased.

    Third, the market is becoming increasingly active. In order to activate the market, we have extensively carried out material exchange work, gradually restored and expanded the processing, ordering, acquisition, and loan business for private industry and commerce, correctly implemented the various policies proposed by Director Chen Yun in his report at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and launched a campaign to promote the sales of industrial products. Through these efforts, the North China market has been greatly activated. For example, the total trade volume of public and private sectors in Beijing increased by 95 percent in July this year compared with February; it is estimated that it will increase by 8 percent in August compared with July, with increases in both public and private trade. Three fertilizer businesses in Shijiazhuang, Zhonghe, Yuxing, and Fuju, recently transported 60 tons of rapeseed cake from Hankou, which was sold out in a few days; the business volume in July increased by about 100% compared with June.

    Fourth, cadres of state-owned trade departments and cooperatives in various places are implementing the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" victories, combined with the production increase and economy competition movement, by clearing warehouses, arranging commodities, disclosing costs, disclosing profits, reviewing prices, and rationally adjusting regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences, thereby clarifying their assets, making prices more reasonable, facilitating sales, and powerfully combating the remaining capitalist management tendencies. Legitimate private industrialists and businessmen, because they have personally experienced the assistance of the People's Government, have realized that operating in accordance with the Common Program, eliminating the "Five Evils," will have broad prospects for development. Their enthusiasm for operation has greatly increased, and their operating style has also improved. For example, in August, 27 industries in Tianjin organized more than 200 people to carry samples and purchasing and sales plans to visit and trade in Northeast China and North China. Due to improved management, improved quality, and reduced costs, the sales volume of private cigarette factories in Tianjin in July increased by 100 to 600% compared with May and June.

    Fifth, foreign trade is developing rapidly. Over the past two years, many local specialties in North China have found broad and reliable markets in the Soviet Union and New Democratic countries. In the future, national and North China local specialties can be exported in even greater quantities. All of these situations cannot but have a positive impact on our material exchange conference.

    Because of the existence of the above favorable conditions, the view that there is nothing more to trade after various places have just held material exchange conferences is incorrect. It is hoped that public and private industrialists and businessmen in various places will actively participate in the transactions of this conference and work together to further improve material exchange and prosper the urban and rural economy.

    What are the tasks of this conference?

    First, vigorously promote the sales of industrial products, handicraft products, and the acquisition of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products, striving for a total transaction volume of 4 trillion yuan (i.e., a total purchase and sale volume of 8 trillion yuan). Although the industrial product promotion campaign in North China has made certain achievements, there is still some backlog of urban industrial products. Therefore, it is necessary to actively promote industrial products first, and focus on promoting non-branded daily-use industrial products to adapt to the development of urban industrial production and meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of urban and rural people, especially farmers after the harvest. Attention should also be paid to organizing the sales of handicraft products. Because today, handicraft products still account for a large proportion of farmers' daily necessities. At the same time, we must vigorously acquire agricultural, sideline, local, and special products, and pay special attention to promoting the diverse small local products that account for a large proportion of farmers' income, develop domestic sales, organize exports, and exchange them for machines. It is necessary to closely combine the promotion of industrial products and handicraft products with the acquisition of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. Only by first promoting the backlog of industrial products and recovering a large amount of currency can we expand the acquisition of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. At the same time, vigorously acquiring agricultural, sideline, local, and special products will open up a larger market for industrial products and handicraft products.

    Second, further guide production and strengthen the planning and organization of production and sales. Many slow-selling products in various places are due to unsuitable specifications, quality, unreasonable prices, or blind operation, resulting in backlogs. Through the conference, trade delegations from various places can communicate production and sales information, observe samples, exchange experiences, establish business relationships, review old contracts, and sign new contracts, which can improve production technology and strengthen the planning and organization of production and sales.

    Third, strengthen the supply of materials and the acquisition of agricultural, sideline, and livestock products in ethnic minority areas, disaster areas, and mountainous areas, and provide appropriate consideration in transactions to promote the development of production in these areas, improve the lives of the people in these areas, further enhance the unity among all ethnic groups, support the self-rescue of people in disaster areas, and implement the spirit of the central government's earnest concern for the people in the old revolutionary base areas.

    Fourth, educate cadres of state-owned trade and cooperatives, as well as private industrialists and businessmen, to establish the operating ideology and style of serving the people, serving production, uniting and helping each other, abiding by policies and laws, strictly abiding by contract credit, and ensuring genuine goods at fair prices and convenience for the masses, and oppose the bad styles of pursuing high profits, not implementing policies, not telling the truth, not being trustworthy, and being selfish and teasing others.

    In order to complete the above tasks, what should we do?

    (1) We must carry out in-depth mobilization and step up preparations. In addition to organizing larger trade delegations by province and city, the five provinces and two cities in North China should also universally organize small trade delegations by special district, county, and town to participate in the conference. In addition to selecting capable cadres from state-owned trade and cooperatives to participate in the trade delegations, the financial and economic committees, industrial and commercial administrative organs, and federations of industry and commerce in various places should also conduct in-depth mobilization of private industrialists and businessmen to participate in the conference through transactions. At present, cadres in some counties, towns, and primary markets have not fully implemented the various policies proposed by Director Chen Yun in his report at the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, so that some private industrialists and businessmen still have concerns and are not active enough in their operations. Therefore, it is necessary to repeatedly explain the various policies proposed by Director Chen Yun to them, eliminate their concerns, solve their difficulties, and promote their active operation. In addition, we also warmly hope that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, all major administrative regions in the country, and remote areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet can send delegations to participate in the transactions of this conference.

    (2) It is hoped that all public and private units participating in the conference can formulate a practical purchasing and sales plan (including purchasing and sales varieties, quantities, specifications, quality, prices, time, etc.) based on the actual situation, preventing both grandiose and conservative ideas. These purchasing and sales plans, along with the samples to be promoted, should be sent to the conference preparatory committee in Tianjin by September 20. This is the primary key to doing a good job in preparing for the conference.

    (3) It is necessary to implement the policy of "taking into account both public and private interests, taking into account both large and small interests, urban-rural mutual assistance, regional mutual assistance, having both buying and selling, and buying and selling more," actively signing contracts, and strictly abiding by contract credit. The conference should grasp the purchasing and sales plans of various places, and under the leadership of the state-owned economy and with the assistance of the industrial and commercial administrative departments of various places, coordinate the various regions, departments, and economic components, so that the various economic components can cooperate and each play their part. The state-owned economy should actively take the lead, closely rely on cooperatives, unite private merchants, and participate in the large and small transaction businesses of the conference. Banking, taxation, transportation, and other departments should, within the scope of national laws and policies, give appropriate consideration and convenience to legitimate private industrialists and businessmen, regardless of large, medium, or small enterprises. All units participating in the transaction should help each other, make concessions, and support each other. In the past, in some material exchange conferences, there were phenomena of "only buying but not selling" or "buying more and selling less" for best-selling goods, and "only selling but not buying" or "selling more and buying less" for slow-selling goods, which seriously hindered material exchange. This exchange conference must prevent this. In order to facilitate a large number of transactions, each unit should, according to the specific conditions of different commodities, adopt flexible and diverse transaction methods such as spot goods and cash, spot goods and deferred payment, cash and futures, deferred payment and futures, barter, chain contracts, consignment sales, and joint purchase and sales to complete the transaction. In addition, the conference should plan to organize various units to exchange production and sales information, convene trade delegation meetings, professional meetings, and distribution meetings for certain best-selling products, so that hot goods can bring cold goods, branded goods can bring non-branded goods, and cold goods can be exchanged for cold goods. The conference should also hold exchange meetings, loan review meetings, price evaluation meetings, and contract review meetings. The conference must also implement the principle of everyone having a specific responsibility and everything having a specific person to do, and well organize all staff to serve the mutual transactions of the trade delegations. And strive to help the banking, insurance, postal and telecommunications, taxation, railway, transportation, and other service groups, so that they can well complete their own tasks in coordinating with the conference transactions.

    (4) In mastering the price policy, it is necessary to ensure that production, transportation, and sales are all profitable, and strive for reasonable stability. Oppose the high-profit view that is harmful to material exchange. For best-selling goods, it is necessary to sell more with small profits and prevent blindly raising prices, so as not to reduce future sales and hit production. For slow-selling goods, the principle should be to not lose money, sell them in time, and open up sales channels, so as not to accumulate funds or deteriorate and rot, damaging the interests of producers. For agricultural and sideline products, those with excessively high acquisition costs in the past should be carefully calculated and appropriately reduced. Regional price differences and wholesale and retail price differences should be mastered reasonably to facilitate material exchange. The same commodity should be of excellent quality at an excellent price and inferior quality at an inferior price to guide the improvement of product specifications and quality.

    (5) It is necessary to ensure the implementation of the contract, which is the key to the final completion of the conference's transaction tasks. To this end, it is first necessary to clarify the legality and seriousness of the contract. Once a contract is signed, it must be implemented. Any attempt to escape contract responsibilities with "doing it if it is profitable, and breaking it up if it is unprofitable" is completely wrong, and it is a destruction of production and sales planning and hinders material exchange. The Trade Bureau of the North China Administrative Council and the North China Cooperative General Agency fined the Pingyuan Province Cooperative and the Changzhi and Yuci Special District Cooperatives in Shanxi in June of this year for bureaucratic and purely profit-oriented views and failure to implement the earth cloth contracts signed at last year's North China Material Exchange Exhibition, which deserves everyone's attention. To this end, various places must clarify production and sales situations and prevent the problems of ordering more than can be produced and failing to deliver the goods, and ordering more than can be sold and failing to sell the goods. Specifications, quality, price, delivery date, delivery location, payment methods, loss, and penalty conditions should all be clearly and definitely stipulated in the contract and agreement, otherwise, disputes will easily occur. The conference should strengthen the contract review work (simplified procedures) to ensure the performance of the contract. For disputes arising from contracts signed in the past, this conference should organize both parties to negotiate based on the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and reconcile and arbitrate. The contract inspection agencies of relevant departments in various places should be further improved if they have been established to supervise the implementation of the contract.

    Under the correct leadership of the North China Administrative Council and with the strong support of major regions, provinces, and cities, and with the public and private economies uniting and working together, I believe that this material exchange conference will be held better than before. Let us step up preparations, hold this conference well, and greet the National Day of our great motherland.

    开好华北区物资交流大会，迎接国庆节
    华北区第二届物资交流大会筹备委员会副主任委员　李哲人
    为了进一步开展物资交流，繁荣城乡经济，以支持工农业爱国增产节约运动，巩固工农联盟，华北区本年度第二届物资交流大会，已决定在九月二十五日在天津市举行。会期暂定两月，必要时并将延长。
    这次大会是在两年来华北物资交流巨大发展的基础上召开的。华北区从一九五○年冬至一九五一年春，在中央正确指示下，曾召开过两次土产会议，这两次会议推动了全区物资交流运动的广泛开展，推销了总值达七十亿斤粮食的土特产品（约等于当时华北粮食总产量的四分之一），对提高农民购买力，开辟工业品的市场，增加国家财政收入，加强城乡互助，巩固工农联盟，支援抗美援朝运动，粉碎美帝国主义所谓“禁运”、“封锁”，都起了很大作用。一九五一年十月，我们又在天津市举办了规模宏大的华北区城乡物资交流展览会，对广大城乡人民进行了一次大规模的系统的具体生动的城乡互助、工农联盟和爱国主义的政治教育，并组织了一万五千多亿元的成交，推动了城乡物资交流的进一步发展。到今年六月，在展览会上签订的合同协议，有百分之九十已经兑现。今年五月我们又在天津召开了华北区物资交流大会，并积极参加了其他大行政区的物资交流大会，同时各省、市、专区、县也广泛地举行了百货大会、骡马大会、药材大会、庙会等各种形式的小型物资交流会，全部成交总额约二万亿元。这就使得华北全区土产于六月底已基本销完，并推销了大批工业品和手工业品，对扭转当时华北市场呆滞现象起了积极作用。事实说明：开好各级市场的物资交流会，就能扩大土产和工业品的内销，就能促进工、农业生产的发展，并使城乡经济全面地活跃起来，就能逐渐加强产销计划性，减少盲目性。因此，可以这样说，物资交流会是在国营经济领导下的新民主主义的有计划有组织的一种很好的贸易形式。根据以上经验，今年七月华北二次经济会议上规定华北区在每年春秋二季要各召开一次物资交流大会，各省市要广泛地召开各种形式的小型物资交流会。此次华北物资交流大会就是根据这个规定召开的。
    当前的经济情况对开好这次物资交流大会是非常有利的。第一、华北全区各种工业，经过三年来的努力，已大体恢复并部分地超过了历史上的最高水平。私营工业经过国家多方面的扶持，亦有很大发展。农业生产亦已超过战前水平。今年大秋作物的丰收景象已定。同时，全区物价已从基本稳定走到完全稳定。全区物价总指数今年来降低了约百分之五，这是“三反”、“五反”运动胜利的成果。工农业生产的发展，物价完全稳定和国家财政收支平衡并有盈余，这就为物资交流的进一步发展创造了极有利的条件。
    第二、由于上述情况，加以农业税减轻，工资调整，补贴制实行和国家建设投资增多，城乡人民购买力已有不少提高。以今年七月为例，华北区布疋和百货的销售量平均比一九五一年同期增加百分之五十九。今年全区城乡人民总购买力，预计较一九五一年增加百分之十六点三。察哈尔省往年销售自行车很少，今年八月各工矿区和各机关的职工、干部共订购了三千辆。目前农村需要工业品的品种、数量均较去年增多，对于质量的要求也提高了。如河北今年一至七月销出的条格府绸布，超过去年全年的销售量二倍半。河北省通县专区供销合作社去年月销食糖一万余斤，今年月销三万斤；茶叶去年月销二千至三千斤，今年月销一万余斤；袜子和毛巾销售额增加四至六倍。河北省农具供应社和合作社今年推销步犁、喷雾器、玉米脱粒机、耘锄、锄草机等新式农具一万八千多件，超过去年推销总数三至四倍。同时，由于爱国卫生运动和祁建华速成识字运动的开展，广大农民对文教、卫生用品的需要也有飞跃增加。通县专区供销合作社去年月销鸵鸟墨水七十打，最近月销一百八十打；去年月销粉笔四千盒，最近月销三万盒。每枝一万至三万元的钢笔在农村很好销，滴滴涕、月经带、药品等卫生用品销售数量均大大增加。
    第三、市场日趋活跃。为了活跃市场，我们曾广泛地开展物资交流工作，逐步恢复和扩大对私营工商业的加工订货、收购和贷款业务，正确执行陈云主任在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的报告中所提出的各种政策，并开展了工业品推销运动。经过这些工作，华北市场已大大活跃起来。如北京公私营贸易总额今年七月比二月增加了百分之九十五；八月估计可比七月增加百分之八，其中公私营贸易均有增加。石家庄肥料业中和、裕兴、福聚等三户，最近从汉口运来菜子饼六十吨，几天就销完了；七月份营业额较六月份约增一倍。
    第四、各地国营贸易部门和合作社干部，正在“三反”“五反”的胜利基础上，结合增产节约竞赛运动，实行清查仓库、商品站队、公开成本、公开利润、审查价格、合理调整地区差价和批发与零售差价，从而弄清了家底，使价格更加合理，便利推销，并有力地打击了残存的资本主义经营倾向。正当的私营工商业者，由于亲身体验到人民政府对他们的扶助，认识到按照共同纲领办事，去掉“五毒”，就有广阔的发展前途，他们的经营积极性已有很大提高，经营作风也有所改进。如天津市八月份有二十七个行业组织了二百余人携带样品和购销计划，分赴东北、华北各地进行访问和交易。天津市各私营烟厂由于改善了经营，提高了质量，降低了成本，七月份销售量较五、六月份增加了一倍至六倍。
    第五、对外贸易日益发展。二年来华北区有许多土特产已在苏联和新民主主义国家中找到了广大而牢靠的销路。今后全国及华北土特产品将可以更大量的输出。这些情况，都不能不对我们这次物资交流大会发生良好的影响。
    由于存在着以上的有利条件，所以那些认为各地刚开完物资交流大会，再没有什么可交易了的观点是不正确的。希望各地公私工商业者，积极地参加这次大会交易，共同为进一步搞好物资交流，繁荣城乡经济而努力。
    这次大会有那些任务呢？
    首先，大力推销工业品、手工业品和收购农、副、土、特产品，争取成交总额达四万亿元（即购销总额八万亿元）。虽然华北地区推销工业品运动已作出了一定成绩，但目前城市工业品仍有若干积压。因此，首先要积极推销工业品，并着重注意推销非名牌货的日用工业品，以适应城市工业生产的发展，满足广大城乡人民特别是丰收后农民的迫切需要。对手工业品，也应重视组织推销。因为今天农民的日用品中，手工业产品仍占很大比重。同时，我们必须大力收购农、副、土、特产品，并特别注意推销占广大农民收入比重很大的种类繁多的零散的小土产，开展内销，组织出口，换回机器。必须把推销工业品、手工业品和收购农、副、土、特产品密切结合起来。只有首先推销了积压的工业品，大量回笼货币，才能扩大对农、副、土、特产品的收购。同时，大力收购农、副、土、特产品，就为工业品和手工业品开拓了更大的销路。
    第二、进一步指导生产和加强产销计划性、组织性。各地滞销产品，多因规格、质量不适用，价格不合理，或因盲目经营，以致造成积压。通过大会，各地贸易团可沟通产销情况、观摩样品，交流经验，建立业务关系，检查旧合同，订立新合同，这就可以改进生产技术，加强产销计划性和组织性。
    第三、加强对少数民族地区、灾区和山区的物资供应与农、副、畜牧产品的收购，并在交易中予以适当照顾，以促进这些地区生产的发展，改善这些地区人民的生活，进一步增强各民族间的团结，支援灾区人民的生产自救，贯彻中央对革命老根据地人民的殷切关怀的精神。
    第四、教育国营贸易和合作社干部，以及私营工商业者，树立为人民服务、为生产服务、团结互助、遵守政策法令、严守合同信用和货真价实、便利群众的经营思想与经营作风，反对追求高利、不执行政策、不说老实话、不讲信用和本位主义、捉弄对方的恶劣作风。
    为了完成上述任务，我们要作些什么呢？
    （一）必须深入动员，加紧准备。华北五省二市除应以省、市为单位组织较大的贸易代表团外，并要以专区、县、镇为单位，普遍组织小型贸易代表团，参加大会。除国营贸易与合作社须选派得力干部参加贸易代表团外，并要经过各地财政经济委员会、工商行政机关和工商业联合会，深入动员各地私人工商业者参加大会交易。目前有些县、镇和初级市场的干部，对陈云主任在全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议上的报告中提出的各种政策，贯彻的还很不够，以致至今仍有少数私营工商业者心怀顾虑，经营不够积极。因此，要反复对他们讲清陈云主任所提出的各种政策，消除其顾虑，解决其困难，推动他们积极经营。此外，我们并热烈希望内蒙古自治区、全国各大行政区及新疆、西藏等边远地区，都能派代表团来参加这次大会的交易。
    （二）希望所有参加大会交易的公私营单位，都能根据实际情况，制订一份切合实际的购销计划（包括购销品种、数量、规格、质量、价格、时间等），既要防止大而无当，也要防止保守思想，这些购销计划连同要推销的样品，应于九月二十日前一并送至设在天津市的大会筹备委员会。这是作好大会准备工作的首要关键。
    （三）必须贯彻“公私兼顾、大小兼顾、城乡互助、地区互助、有买有卖，多买多卖”的方针，积极签订合同，并严守合同信用。大会应掌握各地购销计划，并在国营经济的领导和各地工商行政部门的协助下，使各地区、各部门、各种经济成份相互配合起来，使各种经济成份分工合作，各得其所。国营经济要积极带头，紧紧依靠合作社，团结私商，参加大会中大大小小的交易业务。银行、税务、运输等部门，对正当私营工商业者，不论大、中、小户，都要在国家法令政策范围内，尽可能地给以适当的照顾和便利。所有参加交易的单位都要互助互让、相互支持。在过去一些物资交流会上，曾发生过对畅销货“光买不卖”或“买多卖少”，对滞销货“光卖不买”或“卖多买少”的现象，严重地妨碍了物资交流，此次交流大会须加防止。为了便利大量成交，各单位应根据不同商品的具体情况，采取现货现款、现货期款、现款期货、期款期货、以货易货、连环合同、代购代销、联购联销等灵活的多种多样的交易方式，进行成交。此外，大会要有计划地组织各单位互相交换产销情况，召开贸易代表团会议、专业会议、某些畅销品分配会议，使热货带冷货、名牌货带非名牌货、冷货换冷货的易货会议、贷款审核会议、物价评议会议和合同审查会议。大会还须贯彻人人有专责、事事有专人做的原则，很好地组织所有工作人员，为各贸易团相互成交来服务。并竭力帮助银行、保险、邮电、税务、铁路、交通、运输等服务小组，使之能很好地在配合大会交易中完成自身任务。
    （四）在价格政策的掌握上，要使产、运、销三者均有利，务求合理稳定。反对有害物资交流的高额利润观点。对畅销货，要薄利多销，防止盲目抬价，以免缩小今后销路，打击生产。对滞销货，应以不赔钱，及时推销，打开销路为原则，以免积压资金，或变质腐烂，损害生产者利益。农副产品，过去收购成本过高者，应精打细算，适当降低成本。地区差价、批发零售差价要掌握得合理，以畅通物资交流。同一商品，应当是优货优价，劣货劣价，以指导产品规格、质量的改进。
    （五）必须保证合同的贯彻执行，这是大会成交任务最后完成的关键。为此，首先必须明确合同的法律性、严肃性。合同一经订立，就必须贯彻实现，任何“有利则干、无利则散”的逃避合同责任的企图都是完全错误的，是破坏产销计划性和有碍物资交流的。华北行政委员会贸易局和华北合作总社今年六月曾对平原省合作社和山西长治、榆次两专区社因官僚主义和单纯利润观点而不执行去年华北区物资交流展览会上所订的土布合同，加以罚款处分，值得大家注意。为此，各地必须弄清产销情况，防止产少订多交不出货和订多销少卖不了货的毛病。合同、协议中对规格、质量、价格、交货日期、交货地点、付款办法、损耗、处分条件等均应明确肯定地规定在合同、协议中，否则，便易发生纠纷。大会应加强合同审查工作（要手续简便），以保证合同的履行。过去所订合同发生纠纷者，此次大会应组织双方根据互助互利原则协商，并加以和解、仲裁。各地有关部门的合同检查机构，已建立者应进一步予以健全，以督促合同的执行。
    在华北行政委员会的正确领导下和各大区、省、市的有力支持下，和公私经济团结一致，共同努力下，我相信此次物资交流大会会比以前开得更好。让我们加紧准备，开好这个大会，来迎接我们伟大祖国的国庆节。
