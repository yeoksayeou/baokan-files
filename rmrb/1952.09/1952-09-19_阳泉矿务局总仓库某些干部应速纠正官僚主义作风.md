    Certain Cadres of the Yangquan Mining Bureau General Warehouse Should Quickly Correct Bureaucratic Work Styles

    To the Editor: Certain leading cadres of the Yangquan Mining Bureau General Warehouse are making things difficult for material requisition workers with a very serious bureaucratic attitude.

    On September 4th, Du Congsi and Wang Genzhu, material requisition workers from the Fourth Mine Warehouse, went to the General Warehouse to requisition 95 kilograms of cotton rope. They had already opened a requisition slip, but when they were leaving, the General Warehouse asked them to open a loan slip. Du Congsi and Wang Genzhu refused, and the dispatch section chief and the receiving and dispatching team leader of the General Warehouse beat and scolded them. At the same time, they also took away the cotton rope, their seals, and vouchers. As a result, the Fourth Mine's cart waited in vain for three hours.

    Once, the Fourth Mine needed to requisition more than 10,000 small mine timbers, but the General Warehouse only gave them 1,008. It was clearly a mistake made by the people in the General Warehouse, but they refused to admit their mistake. Only after the General Bureau calculated it did they correct it.

    The General Warehouse originally had 4,000 meters of steel wire rope in stock, one of which was 1,000 meters long, and the rest were all 500 meters long. Once, the Fourth Mine needed to requisition two 1,000-meter-long steel wire ropes. The day before, they had sent the requisition slip to the General Warehouse. The next day, the Third Mine also went to requisition materials, wanting to requisition 500-meter-long steel wire ropes. However, the General Warehouse spent more than 20 man-hours cutting off the 1,000-meter-long steel wire rope. At that time, material requisition worker Wang Genzhu raised an objection and firmly refused to let them cut it off, but the material section chief of the General Warehouse refused to accept Wang Genzhu's opinion and forcibly cut the steel wire rope into two pieces. Similar situations are numerous in the General Warehouse.

        I hope that the relevant personnel of the Yangquan Mining Bureau General Warehouse will quickly correct this bureaucratic work style and make a profound self-criticism.

### 阳泉矿务局总仓库某些干部应速纠正官僚主义作风

    阳泉矿务局总仓库某些干部应速纠正官僚主义作风
    编辑同志：阳泉矿务局总仓库的某些领导干部，以十分严重的官僚主义态度为难领料工人。
    九月四日，四矿仓库领料工人杜聪肆、王根柱向总仓库领棉丝绳九十五公斤。他们本来已开上领条，但出门时总仓库又叫开借条。杜聪肆和王根柱不开，总仓库调配科长和收发组长等人，就把他们两人打骂了一顿，同时还把棉丝绳和他们两人的图章、凭条都收走了。结果，使四矿的马车白白等了三个钟头。
    有一次四矿要领一万多根小道木，总库只给一千零八根，明明是总仓库的人给错了，他们却不承认错误。经过总局计算后，他们才纠正。
    总仓库本来存有四千公尺钢丝绳，其中有一根一千公尺长，其余均为五百公尺长。有一次四矿要领两条一千公尺长的钢丝绳，在前一天已经给总仓库送去了领票。第二天三矿也去领料，要领五百公尺长的钢丝绳，总仓库却费了二十多个人工，把那根一千公尺长的钢丝绳截断了。当时领料工人王根柱，曾提出意见坚决不要他们截断，但是总仓库的材料处长，却不肯接受王根柱的意见，强令把钢丝绳截成两断。类似的情况在总仓库是很多的。
        我希望阳泉矿务局总仓库的有关人员赶快改正这种官僚主义作风，并作深刻检讨。        常杰
