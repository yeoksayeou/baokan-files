Editor's Note: Nanjing residents Liang Yeshi and Jinan residents Zhang Yangshi, in letters to the editorial departments of Nanjing Xinhua Daily and Jinan Dazhong Daily, exposed the crimes of Nanjing City and Shandong Province People's Court retained personnel Chen Jinan, Zhang Jiuze, etc., in harboring and releasing blood-debt-ridden traitors and tyrants. In the judicial reform movement, the Nanjing City and Shandong Province People's Courts should ascertain the facts and give Chen Jinan and Zhang Jiuze the necessary sanctions.

Liang Yeshi's letter to Nanjing Xinhua Daily:
Comrade Editor:

　　I very much support the judicial reform movement launched by the People's Court of our city. Now I want to accuse Chen Jinan (retained personnel), a judge of the Municipal People's Court, of releasing the heinous counter-revolutionary Zhu Qiuyuan.

　　Zhu Qiuyuan is a traitor and tyrant whom the residents of our Sanpailou hate to the bone. After the Japanese devils occupied Nanjing, he became the supervisor of the Japanese devils' factory and killed more than one hundred workers. My son Liang Peixin and five other workers were put in sacks by him and thrown into the river to drown, and even their corpses cannot be found to this day. After my son died, our family of seven suffered untold hardships before we managed to survive these ten years.

　　After liberation, we thought that this deep blood feud would definitely be redressed. In December 1949, we asked someone to write a complaint and sent it to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After investigation, the bureau arrested Zhu Qiuyuan and sent him to the Municipal People's Court. Who knew that Chen Jinan, the judge handling the case, not only did not punish Zhu Qiuyuan according to the law, but released Zhu Qiuyuan instead.

　　When handling this blood case, Chen Jinan did not have the slightest hatred for Zhu Qiuyuan, a counter-revolutionary element with heinous crimes, and he even nodded when Zhu Qiuyuan spoke, saying "Yes, yes"; but when we spoke, he deliberately made things difficult for us, asking us to find more witnesses. We repeatedly asked him to investigate in Sanpailou, but his butt was as if nailed to the court, and he didn't move at all. After asking two sessions in such a muddle-headed manner, he later asked us what we "meant" by suing Zhu Qiuyuan. Obviously, he still wanted to be like the Kuomintang's pseudo-judges, implying that Zhu Qiuyuan should take out some stinky money and settle the matter. When my daughter-in-law resolutely demanded that Zhu Qiuyuan be punished, he openly defended Zhu Qiuyuan, saying that Zhu Qiuyuan's killing "could not be confirmed."

　　With Chen Jinan's help, the counter-revolutionary Zhu Qiuyuan was released in less than three months. Now I want to ask Chen Jinan: Is it really impossible to confirm Zhu Qiuyuan's counter-revolutionary crimes? The Public Security Bureau investigated Zhu Qiuyuan's crimes for several weeks, why didn't you inquire about it? As long as the old people in Sanpailou are asked, which one doesn't know Zhu Qiuyuan's crimes! Two or three hundred people in Sanpailou were directly or indirectly persecuted by Zhu Qiuyuan. If you just talk to a few people, wouldn't you confirm Zhu Qiuyuan's crimes? Why did you stick to your desk and not go to investigate even once?

　　Although Zhu Qiuyuan was caught again by a worker who had been persecuted by him after being released by Chen Jinan, and was shot by the government last June, which relieved everyone's hatred; but Chen Jinan's behavior of letting go of counter-revolutionary elements is an intolerable criminal act. I demand that the relevant leaders give him a certain punishment according to the law, otherwise the court will lose its role in protecting the interests of the people.

Zhang Yangshi's letter to Jinan Dazhong Daily:
Comrade Editor:

　　I am a lonely old woman. During the Japanese devils' rule, the big tyrants Zhang Yiting and Zhang Huande, father and son, in Jinan Daguanyuan, relied on the enemy's power to forcibly occupy my house, beat and insulted my husband to death, leaving me helpless. I was so angry that I filed a complaint in the pseudo-local court at the time. But my lawsuit was not won, and the pseudo-judge threatened me: "If you old thing don't understand the rules, you will be forced to drink chili water at the Gendarmerie Headquarters!" My husband told me before he died: When the sky clears, you must avenge me, and you must not spare Zhang Yiting.

　　Jinan was liberated, and I thought the sky was clear. On July 23, 1949, I went to the Jinan Municipal People's Court to accuse the tyrant Zhang Yiting, hoping that the People's Court would uphold justice and avenge me. Who knew that the "judge" did not consider it and said at the beginning that my evidence was from the past and was insufficient. During the second hearing, the "judge" said again: "This house was clearly sold to someone, why do you say that they occupied it?" God, at that time, Zhang Yiting's son took the written contract and led two Japanese military police and secret agent Yang Hongshun (Zhang Yiting's adopted son) and forced me to put my seal on the contract, how can this be considered my sale? The "judge" said that my evidence was from the past and was insufficient, how could the contract privately made by Zhang Yiting also be from the past but be valid? Why didn't the "judge" mention a word about Zhang Yiting colluding with Japanese invaders and traitors, harming the people, and forcing people to death? This case was dragged on until July 21 of the following year before a judgment was made, and the content of the judgment was still what the "judge" said during the hearing. I was so angry when I received this unreasonable judgment that I appealed to the Provincial People's Court on August 12 of that year. I thought that this time it would definitely be resolved well. Who would have thought that the "judge" who accepted this case, Zhang Jiuze (Note: Zhang is an old judicial staff), was even worse. Not only did he not investigate, and did not ask about the blood debts Zhang Yiting and Zhang Huande owed me, but he slandered me, saying: "You are just doing it for a few coins." He also insisted that my "evidence was insufficient" and wanted to reject my appeal. When I heard this, my lungs almost exploded, and I questioned him in court, asking him to look at the evidence and go down to investigate, but he ignored me. At that time, I thought: Zhang Jiuze must be a "mixed-up person" (referring to the old judicial staff), taking bribes, and it was useless to argue with him, so wait for the next hearing! So I went home with tears in my eyes and suppressed my anger. However, the Provincial People's Court did not summon me again and issued a judgment in November, saying: "The Municipal People's Court believes that the respondent (referring to Zhang Yiting) has no forced action, and the appellant cannot provide evidence of forced action. Therefore, the result of the judgment of the Municipal People's Court is to reject the appellant's appeal. After reviewing the case file, this court still agrees with the judgment of the first instance." I was shaking with anger at the time, wishing I could find Zhang Jiuze and fight him to the death. Zhang Jiuze only asked one session casually and judged the case, and instead of dealing with the big tyrant, he made things difficult for me, an old woman who was bullied by the tyrant. What position did he stand on? I wanted to appeal again, but because I was old and my eyes were not good, I suppressed it. But I will never forget this anger. I sent the evidence of Zhang Yiting bullying me to Director Cao of the Daguanyuan Police Station and asked him to help me deal with Zhang Yiting and avenge my dead husband. When counter-revolutionaries were suppressed last April, the People's Government arrested the tyrant Zhang Yiting, and I and all the people in Daguanyuan who had been harmed by Zhang Yiting accused him of his crimes. The People's Government executed him, and the house that Zhang Yiting occupied was also resolved at the end of last year.

　　I heard the other day that the court is going to reform, and I am really happy! I thank the Communist Party and the People's Government, and at the same time demand that the People's Government clean up the bad elements who have infiltrated the People's Court. Zhang Yangshi

    南京市、山东省人民法院审判员陈季楠、张九泽等
    胆敢包庇与放纵大恶霸和反革命分子
    梁叶氏、张杨氏要求给予制裁
　　编者按：南京市居民梁叶氏、济南市居民张杨氏在写给南京新华日报及济南大众日报编辑部的信中，揭发了南京市、山东省人民法院留用人员陈季楠、张九泽等包庇并放走血债累累的汉奸恶霸的罪行。在司法改革运动中，南京市、山东省人民法院应该查明事实，给陈季楠及张九泽以必要的制裁。
    梁叶氏给南京新华日报的信编辑同志：
　　我非常拥护本市人民法院开展司法改革运动。现在我要控诉市人民法院审判员陈季楠（留用人员）放走罪恶滔天的反革命分子朱秋尧的罪行。
　　朱秋尧是我们三牌楼居民都恨之入骨的一个汉奸恶霸。日本鬼子侵占南京后，他就当了日本鬼子工厂的监督长，害死过一百多个工人。我的儿子梁培信和其他五个工人，是被他用麻袋装着抛到江里淹死的，到现在连尸首都找不到。我的儿子死后，我们一家七口人吃了千辛万苦，好容易才熬过这十来年。
    解放了，我们想这种血海深仇一定能够申雪了。一九四九年十二月，我们找人写了一张状子送到公安五分局，该局调查后就把朱秋尧捕送市人民法院。那知处理这个案子的审判员陈季楠，不但没有依法惩办朱秋尧，反把朱秋尧放走了。
    陈季楠在处理这件血案时，对朱秋尧这样一个罪大恶极的反革命分子没有丝毫仇恨，而且在朱秋尧讲话时他还点着头，嘴里说着“是的，是的”；但到我们说话时，他却故意为难，叫我们多找证人。我们几次要求他到三牌楼调查，但他的屁股像钉在法院里一样，一动也不动。就这样糊糊涂涂的问了两堂，后来他竟问起我们告朱秋尧是“什么意思”来了。显然的，他还想和国民党的伪法官一样，暗示朱秋尧拿出几个臭钱和解了事。当我儿媳妇坚决要求惩办朱秋尧时，他就公开为朱秋尧辩护，说朱秋尧杀人“无法证实”。
    反革命分子朱秋尧在陈季楠的帮助下，不到三个月就被放出来了。现在我要问问陈季楠：朱秋尧的反革命罪行真无法证实吗？公安局对朱秋尧的罪行调查了几个星期，你为什么不去查问呢？三牌楼只要是上年纪的老百姓，那一个不知道朱秋尧的罪恶呀！三牌楼直接间接受朱秋尧迫害的老百姓有二、三百人，你只要找几个人谈一谈，不就证实了朱秋尧的罪恶吗？你为什么死守着办公桌子，一次也不去调查呢？
    朱秋尧被陈季楠放跑后，虽然又被受过他迫害的一个工人抓到，在去年六月被政府枪毙了，给大家解了恨；可是陈季楠这种放走反革命分子的行为，却是令人不能容忍的犯罪行为。我要求有关领导上依法给他一定的惩处，否则法院就会失去保护人民利益的作用。

    张杨氏给济南大众日报的信编辑同志：
　　我是一个孤苦伶丁的老婆子。在日本鬼子统治的时候，济南大观园里的大恶霸张仪亭、张焕德父子二人，依仗敌人势力，强霸我的房子，毒打、凌辱我的丈夫致死，害得我无依无靠。我气极了，到当时的伪地方法院告状。可是我的官司没有打赢，伪法官吓唬我：“你这个老东西再不懂规矩，非叫你到宪兵司令部去喝辣椒水不行！”我丈夫在临死的时候告诉我：等晴了天，你千万要给我报仇，决不能饶了张仪亭。
　　济南解放了，我想这可晴天了。一九四九年七月二十三日，我到济南市人民法院控告恶霸张仪亭，盼望着人民法院给我作主、报仇。谁知道，“法官”不加考虑，一开头就说我的证据是过去的，不足为凭。第二次开庭时，那个“法官”又说：“你这房子明明是卖给人家了，为什么又说人家霸占呢？”天哪，在那时候，张仪亭的儿子拿着写好的文约，领着两个日本宪兵和特务杨洪顺（张仪亭的干儿子）逼着俺在约上盖印，这怎么能算俺卖的呢？“法官”说我的证据是过去的，不足为凭，怎么张仪亭私造的文约也是过去的，就有效呢？为什么张仪亭勾结日寇、汉奸，祸害人民，逼死人命，“法官”却一字不提呢？这个案子一直拖到第二年的七月二十一日才判决，而判决的内容仍然是那个“法官”在开庭时说的那一套。我接到这个无理的判决书，气得要命，就在当年八月十二日到省人民法院上诉。我心想这回一定能解决得好。谁料想，受理这个案子的“法官”叫张九泽（按：张是旧司法人员）更不好。他不但不调查，不问张仪亭、张焕德欠我的血债，反而诬蔑我说：“你就是为的几个钱。”他又一口咬定说我的“证据不足”，要驳回我的上诉。我一听，真气炸了肺，就当庭质问他，要他看证据，到下边调查，他都不理。当时我想：张九泽一定是“二混子”（指旧司法人员的意思），吃了贿赂，和他争辩也没有用，再等下次开庭吧！就含着眼泪，压着气回家了。可是，以后省人民法院没再传问我，就在十一月下了判决书，说什么“市人民法院认为被上诉人（指张仪亭）确无强迫之事，而且上诉人又提不出强迫的证据来，因此，市人民法院判决的结果将上诉人的上诉驳回。经本院阅卷后，仍同意一审之判决”。我当时气得浑身打哆嗦，恨不得去找张九泽拚命。张九泽只马马虎虎地问了一堂就判案，对大恶霸不处理，反倒刁难我这个受恶霸欺负的老婆子。他站的是甚么立场呢？我想再上诉，因为年纪大，眼又不中用，就压下了。但我受的这口气死也忘不了。我把张仪亭欺负我的证据，送到大观园派出所曹所长那里，叫他帮助我处理张仪亭，为我死去的丈夫报仇雪恨。去年四月镇压反革命时，人民政府把恶霸张仪亭逮捕了，我和大观园的所有被张仪亭祸害过的人，控诉了他的罪恶。人民政府把他枪决了，张仪亭霸占我的房子到去年年底也解决了。
    前两天听说法院要进行改革，我真是高兴！我感谢共产党和人民政府，同时要求人民政府洗刷混进人民法院里面的坏分子。　张杨氏
