    Anhui People's Broadcasting Station Accepts Criticism and Decides to Strengthen Economic Work Reporting
    Editor Comrades: The "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on June 23 published a letter from Comrade Jiang Hudong criticizing the Anhui People's Broadcasting Station for not paying enough attention to political propaganda during the period of state procurement of wheat. We believe that Comrade Jiang Hudong's criticism is completely correct.
    During the wheat procurement process, we only organized two lectures on wheat procurement issues and broadcast one news report. This shows that we did not pay enough attention to the publicity work on wheat procurement issues. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we have contacted relevant agencies in July and organized them to write articles in order to improve the reporting on wheat procurement issues. At the same time, it has been decided to establish an economic correspondent network in the future to strengthen the reporting on economic work, in order to fundamentally improve the work in this area.

    安徽人民广播电台接受批评决定加强经济工作报道
    编辑同志：六月二十三日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了姜湖东同志的信，对安徽人民广播电台在国家收购小麦期间不重视政治宣传工作的缺点进行了批评。我们认为姜湖东同志的批评是完全正确的。
    在小麦收购过程中，我们只组织了两次关于小麦收购问题的讲座，广播了一篇新闻报道。这说明我们对小麦收购问题的宣传工作是不够重视的。为了克服这一缺点，我们已在七月份和有关机关取得联系，并组织他们写稿，以便改进收购小麦问题的报道工作；同时决定今后要建立经济通讯网，加强对经济工作的报道，以求从根本上来改进这方面的工作。
    安徽省人民广播电台
