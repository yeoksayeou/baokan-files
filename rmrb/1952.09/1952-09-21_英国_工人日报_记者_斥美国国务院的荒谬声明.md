Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 20th: The London "Daily Worker" published an article on its front page by its diplomatic correspondent, titled "State Department Unleashes Attacks on Scientists" and "Washington Panics in the Face of Bacteriological Warfare Facts." The reporter wrote: "The results of the international scientists' investigation into the bacteriological warfare conducted in China and Korea have caused the U.S. State Department to issue Washington's most hysterical and crude public statement in recent years.

"The State Department issued a public statement late Monday night, unleashing personal attacks on seven prominent scientists because these seven scientists proved in a 300,000-word report that the United States was conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of Korea and China."

The reporter said: "The State Department's reaction exposes its extreme fear of the possible impact of the scientists' detailed evidence after it is published. ...The State Department didn't even bother to look at the scientists' report.

"Its aim is to slander the investigation as a 'Communist trick' carried out by Communist sympathizers."

The "Daily Worker" diplomatic correspondent wrote: The State Department, not even waiting to see the scientists' report, slandered the report as a "hoax" based on lies, false evidence, and false confessions.

    英国“工人日报”记者
    斥美国国务院的荒谬声明
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】伦敦“工人日报”在首页刊载外交记者的文章，题为“国务院对科学家们滥施攻击”及“华盛顿在细菌战事实面前惊惶失措”。记者写道：“国际科学家们调查在中国与朝鲜进行的细菌战的结果，使美国国务院发表了华盛顿近年来最歇斯底里与粗暴的公报。
    “国务院于星期一深晚发表公报，对七位著名的科学家滥施人身攻击，因为这七位科学家在一篇三十万字长的报告书中证明了美国对朝鲜与中国人民进行细菌战。”
    记者说：“国务院的反应暴露了它极其害怕科学家们详尽的证据发表后可能引起的影响。……国务院连科学家的报告书都来不及看一下。
    “它的目的是要把这次调查诬蔑成是共产党同情者进行的一次‘共产党把戏’。”
    “工人日报”外交记者写道：国务院来不及等着看一下科学家的报告书，就诬蔑这个报告书是根据谎话、伪证与假供词制成的“骗局”。
