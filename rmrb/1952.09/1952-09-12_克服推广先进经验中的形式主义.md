    To the Editor: Workers of the Beijing Construction Company have created many advanced tools and operating methods in the patriotic production increase and economy campaign. However, in promoting these advanced experiences, the leading cadres of some construction sites only pay attention to whether the number of advanced groups has increased, regardless of the use of advanced tools and the quality of the promotion of advanced experiences, thus resulting in some formalistic phenomena. For example, the bricklayer advanced group in the Changxindian work area appears to have 158 people, but in reality, only one group (more than 20 people) used advanced tools for three days, and then stopped using them. Only one of the six bricklayer groups in the northern suburban work area used the advanced "mortar applicator."

    Under these circumstances, the tendency to disregard efficiency and quality is also extremely serious. For example, the bricklayer advanced group at the 5220 construction site builds bricks for one day and then waits for a day, either waiting for earthworkers to fill soil or waiting for bricks and mortar. More than 54 meters of brick wall were completely rebuilt because the brick joints were too wide (a fist could fit in, there should have been eight layers of bricks, but only seven layers were actually laid).

    Although the leadership of the Construction Company has issued calls for the promotion of advanced experiences, held demonstrations at construction sites, and instructed the heads of each construction site to cultivate typical groups, they have rarely considered how to do it specifically and how to solve the new problems that arise after the advanced experiences are promoted.

    Therefore, I suggest that the Construction Company and some leading cadres of the construction sites quickly correct the above-mentioned phenomena.

### 克服推广先进经验中的形式主义

    克服推广先进经验中的形式主义
    编辑同志：北京市建筑公司工人在爱国增产节约运动中，创造了不少先进工具和操作方法。但是，在推广这些先进经验时，某些工地的领导干部只注意先进小组人数是不是增加了，而不管先进工具的使用以及先进经验推广的好坏，因而就产生了某些形式主义的现象。如长辛店工区瓦工先进小组，表面上看是一百五十八人，实际只有一个小组（二十多人）使用了三天先进工具，以后就不用了。北郊工区六个瓦工组，只有一个组使用了先进的“铺灰器”。
    在这种情况下，忽视效率和质量的偏向也极严重。如五二二○工地的瓦工先进小组砌一天砖窝一天工，不是等着土工填土，就是待砖待浆。五十四米多长的砖墙，因砖缝过宽（能放进一个拳头，应该是八层砖，实砌了七层），全部返工了。
    建筑公司的领导方面，对于先进经验的推广，虽然做过号召，也曾在工地表演过，并曾指示各工地主任必须培养典型小组，但是，具体如何做，推广先进经验后发生的新问题又如何解决，领导方面是很少考虑的。
    因此，我建议建筑公司及工地的某些领导干部，赶快改正上述现象。　　　　　　　　程　序
