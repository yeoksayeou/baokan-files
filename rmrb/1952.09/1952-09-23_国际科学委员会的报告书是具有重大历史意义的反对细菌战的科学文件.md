The International Scientific Commission's Report Is a Scientific Document of Major Historical Significance Opposing Germ Warfare
Infectious Disease Expert Zhong Huilan

As loyal, science-loving, truth-seeking, and peace-loving doctors and scientists, we participated six months ago in the work of opposing germ warfare and investigating the U.S. government's use of bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese and Korean people. Based on the abnormal season, abnormal locations, and abnormal distribution of insects scattered by U.S. aircraft, based on the eyewitness accounts and material evidence of U.S. aircraft scattering insects, feathers, leaves, and other objects, based on the various containers found in areas where U.S. aircraft scattered bacteria and insects, based on the various pathogens isolated from insects, feathers, leaves, and other objects scattered by U.S. aircraft, based on the various abnormal phenomena of diseases occurring in areas where U.S. aircraft scattered bacteria, insects, feathers, and other objects, and the emergence of new types of epidemics, based on the confessions of four American air force prisoners who admitted to personally participating in germ warfare in China and Korea, and based on the confessions of U.S. military paratrooper spies sent to investigate the effects of germ warfare, the crime of U.S. imperialism in conducting germ warfare is undeniable. Not long ago, the "Investigation Group of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers" composed of international impartial persons, the "Investigation Group on the Crimes of U.S. Imperialism in Germ Warfare" composed of Chinese experts, scholars, and people from all walks of life, and the "Joint Interrogation Group of Korean and Chinese Expert Journalists" all fully exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism in conducting germ warfare. Because American germ warfare criminals feared the punishment of the people of the world, they deliberately made absurd statements to confuse the public, and used reactionary newspapers in capitalist countries to deliberately say that the composition of the above-mentioned investigation groups did not include scientists from capitalist countries, thus attempting to use this excuse to deny the crimes. However, the people of the world have long seen through the crimes of U.S. imperialism.

In late June of this year, the "International Scientific Commission" was organized, with the task of investigating and collecting facts about whether the U.S. government had conducted germ warfare in Korea and China. This commission was composed of authoritative, respected, and impartial scientists from around the world, including Professor Bressau from Brazil, a well-known expert in entomology, parasitology, and epidemiology; Mrs. Audren, a seasoned biochemist and clinical expert from Sweden, nearly seventy years old. In addition, there was Dr. Joseph Needham, a famous scientist from the United Kingdom, Professor Olivo, a famous medical professor from Italy, Professor Magdelaine, a famous agricultural livestock expert from France, and Professor Zhukov-Veresnikov, a Soviet authority on bacteriology. Except for Zhukov-Veresnikov, the other members all grew up in typical capitalist countries. From the day they arrived in Beijing until they finished their report and left Beijing, a period of more than two months, I and several colleagues in the medical field accompanied them to investigate and collect evidence of the crimes of U.S. imperialism in conducting germ warfare in Korea and China. We went to various places in Northeast China and Korea for on-site investigations. In Korea, we personally witnessed American planes inhumanly bombing and strafing defenseless women, children, and the elderly, and civilian houses without any military equipment, day and night. One night, near the air-raid shelter where we were staying, nine bombs fell, two of which exploded only about twenty meters away from the entrance of our shelter. The bodies of innocent Korean comrades who were killed were lying tragically on the road. During our journey in Korea, in addition to the threat of strafing by U.S. aircraft, we were injured in a car accident. For more than two months, I had fairly close contact with the members in terms of life and work, so I have a full understanding and deep impression of their investigation work. They conducted their investigation and analysis of things completely based on the most rigorous scientific principles and with a high degree of objectivity. They are worthy of being impartial, unbiased, realistic, and truth-seeking scientists. For example, Dr. Joseph Needham once spoke at a gathering, and the gist of his remarks is translated as follows: "I am a member of the Royal Society of the United Kingdom. People in our Royal Society investigate everything with a skeptical, unbiased, calm, and objective attitude. Our sole purpose is to pursue the truth. Our society has a historically significant commemorative shield. The front of this shield is completely blank, smooth, and without any words, symbolizing uprightness and purity. My attitude towards the investigation of germ warfare is the same. After detailed investigation and research, and after obtaining the truth, it can be announced to the world." The attitudes of the other members were also the same, objective and serious. Therefore, whether in the investigation of the Gannan plague incident, the Kuandian bacteriological bomb incident, the anthrax pneumonia and anthrax meningitis incidents in eastern and western Liaoning, the Shenyang encephalitis incident, the Jiangxi-gun plague incident in Korea, or the Datong-gun cholera incident, the committee conducted very detailed, objective, and scientific investigations and analyses, and everyone reached a unanimous opinion before drawing conclusions. Because the U.S. military violated international law and barbarously carried out indiscriminate bombing and strafing everywhere in Korea, the committee, after completing its investigation in Northeast China, considered the life-threatening dangers they might encounter when investigating in Korea. However, everyone's spirit of pursuing the truth overcame all concerns, and they bravely went to Korea to investigate. This fully demonstrates that all the members were united in the spirit of pursuing the truth when solving any problem. In order to seek the truth, they were not afraid of trouble, and even risked going to areas bombed by the enemy day and night to investigate in person.

On August 31st, the committee signed a historic investigation report in Beijing. The conclusion of this report solemnly points out: "The people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed become the targets of attacks with bacteriological weapons; the American army has used these bacteriological weapons in many different ways, some of which appear to be developments of methods used by the Japanese army in bacteriological warfare during the Second World War." "Now, the people of the world should redouble their efforts to save the world from war and to prevent the inventions of science from being used to destroy humanity."

The committee conducted investigations and analyses with the highest degree of objectivity, following the most rigorous scientific principles, and reached the above correct conclusions. This ironclad fact is a very heavy blow to the American war-mongers. And the members of the committee are all world-renowned, respected, and impartial scientists. The American war-mongers can no longer say that this committee is not qualified to investigate. How could they not know that what the scientists of China and Korea said was the truth, just as the truth that the Earth is round, but in order to save their already unsalvageable defeat, they shamelessly and brazenly said that the evidence published by Chinese and Korean scientists was unreliable, just as saying that what Chinese and Korean scientists said about the Earth being round was unreliable is equally absurd. This kind of deceptive argument has long been bankrupt. No matter how the American war-mongers distort right and wrong and confuse the public, after more than two months of investigation and analysis in China and Korea, they have long unanimously admitted that the standards of Chinese and Korean scientists are as high and as reliable as those of scientists in any country in the world. The strength of the Chinese people's anti-epidemic and health movement is strong and effective. The committee's report affirms the crimes of U.S. imperialism, so the United States must hate it very much. At the same time, the American war-mongers will definitely hate and resent the members of the committee. But the members have already made a historical and great contribution to saving science, saving peace, and saving mankind. This contribution will be immortal in human history!

    国际科学委员会的报告书是具有重大历史意义的反对细菌战的科学文件
    传染病学专家  钟惠澜
    作为忠实的、热爱科学的、追求真理的、爱好和平的医生和科学家，我们在六个月以前参加了反对细菌战和调查美国政府使用细菌武器屠杀中、朝人民的工作。根据从美机撒布昆虫的反常季节，反常场所，和反常分布，根据目击美机撒布昆虫、羽毛、树叶及其他物体的人证物证，根据在美机撒布细菌和昆虫的地区所发现的各种容器，根据从美机撒布昆虫、羽毛、树叶等物体所分离出的各种病菌，根据在美机撒布细菌昆虫、羽毛等物体的地区所发生疾病的种种反常现象，和新型的疫病的出现，根据四个美国空军俘虏承认亲自参加在中朝两国进行细菌战的供词，和根据美军遣派调查细菌战效果的空降特务的供词，美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行，是不容抵赖的。不久以前由国际公正人士所组成的
    “国际民主法律工作者协会调查团”，由我国专家学者及各界人士所组成的“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”，和“朝、中专家记者联合讯问团”，都曾充分揭发了美帝国主义进行细菌战的罪行。美国细菌战犯因畏惧世界人民的惩罚，故作谰言混乱视听，利用资本主义国家的反动报纸，故意说以上所提的各调查团的组成，并未包括资本主义国家的科学家，因此希图借词抵赖，但美帝国主义的罪行，全世界人民早已洞悉了。
    今年六月下旬，组织了“国际科学委员会”，他们的任务是调查和收集关于美国政府在朝鲜和中国是否进行了细菌战的事实。这个委员会是由世界上有权威的、德高望重的、公正的科学家们组成的，其中有由巴西万里飞来的贝索亚教授，他是昆虫学、寄生物学、和流行病学有名的专家；有来自瑞典年近古稀的安德琳夫人，她是一个富有经验的生物化学家和临床专家。此外，有来自英国的著名科学家李约瑟博士，意大利的著名医学教授欧利佛博士，法国的著名农业牲畜专家马戴尔教授，和苏联细菌学权威茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫教授。除了茹科夫—维勒斯尼科夫以外，其余的委员们，都是生长在典型的资本主义国家的环境里。自从他们到北京那一天起，至他们写完了他们的报告书离开北京的两个多月的期间，我和数位医界同人，一直陪同他们调查和收集美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的罪证，我们一齐到东北和朝鲜各地作了现场的调查。在朝鲜的时候，我们亲眼看见了美国飞机惨无人道地昼夜轰炸扫射手无寸铁的妇孺老幼，和毫无军事设备的民房。有一天晚上，在我们住的防空洞附近，下了九个炸弹，其中两个是在距离我们的洞口仅二十米左右爆炸的，被炸死的无辜朝鲜同志的尸体，很凄惨地横卧在路上。在朝鲜旅途上，除了美机扫射威胁以外，我们曾因车祸受伤。两个多月以来，在生活上和工作上，我和委员们都有相当密切的接触，因此我对于他们的调查工作，是有充分的了解和深刻的印象。他们是完全根据了最严格的科学原则，并以高度的客观态度，来进行调查分析事物的，他们是不愧为公正的、无偏见的、实事求是的、追求真理的科学家。比如李约瑟博士在某次聚会时曾发言，其大意节译如下：“我是英国皇家学会的一个会员，我们皇家学会的人们，无论调查任何事物，都是抱着怀疑的、无成见的、冷静的、和客观的态度来进行，其唯一目的是在于追求真理，我们的会里有一个很有历史意义的纪念盾，这个纪念盾的正面，是完全空白光滑无字的，象征着光明正大，一尘不染。我对于调查细菌战的态度，也是这样，经过了详细调查研究，得出真理以后，才能公布于全世界。”其他委员们的态度也是一样的客观，一样的严肃。所以无论在调查甘南鼠疫事件，宽甸细菌弹事件，辽东辽西的炭疽肺炎和炭疽脑膜炎事件，沈阳脑炎事件，朝鲜江西郡鼠疫事件，或大同郡霍乱事件，都是经过了委员会很详细的、客观的、科学的调查分析，大家达到了一致的意见，然后作出结论。因为美军违背国际公法，野蛮地在朝鲜到处盲目轰炸扫射，委员会在东北调查完毕以后，曾考虑到他们到朝鲜调查时所可能遭遇的生命危险，但是大家追求真理的精神战胜了一切顾虑，很勇敢地到了朝鲜去调查。这一点充分地说明了全体委员们，在解决任何一个问题的时候，大家都是一致地本着追求真理的精神，为了求得真理，他们是不怕麻烦的，甚至于冒险亲身到了敌人昼夜轰炸的地区去调查。
    委员会于八月三十一日在北京签署了一个有历史性的调查报告书，这个报告书的结论，严正地指出：“朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标；美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成立。”“现在，全世界的人民都应加倍努力，使世界免遭战祸，并制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类。”
    委员会以最高度的客观态度，遵循最严格的科学原则进行调查分析，得到上述的正确结论。这个铁一般的事实对美国战争贩子的打击，是非常沉重的。而委员会的委员们，都是世界有名的德高望重的公正的科学家，美国战争贩子再也不能说这个委员会不够资格调查了。他们何尝不知道中朝两国的科学家所说的都是真理，这个真理如同说地球是圆的真理一样，但为了挽救其早已不可挽救的失败，他们无耻厚颜地说，中朝科学家所发表的证据，都是不可靠的，如同说中朝科学家所说地球是圆的为不可靠，是同样的荒谬。这种欺骗的论调早已破产。不管美国战争贩子如何的歪曲是非、扰乱视听，委员会在中国和朝鲜经过两个多月的调查分析，他们早已异口同声地承认中朝科学家的水准与世界任何国家的科学家的水准是一样高和一样可靠的。中国人民的防疫和卫生运动的力量，是强大而有效的。委员会的报告书，肯定了美帝国主义的罪行，因此美国一定很厌恶它，同时美国战争贩子对于委员们也一定会讨厌和痛恨的，但委员们已经做了历史性的拯救科学、拯救和平、拯救人类的伟大贡献，这个贡献将与人类历史永垂不朽！
