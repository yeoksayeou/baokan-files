    Yoshida Government Illegally Sabotages JCP Election Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd Dispatch] Tokyo News: During the election period, the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is intensifying its persecution of the Japanese Communist Party, illegally disrupting and obstructing the JCP's election campaign.
    According to the International News Service, in order to persecute the JCP, "Japanese police have taken precautionary measures nationwide." On the 16th, a group of students and women were distributing election leaflets near the gate of Tokyo University in Bunkyo Ward, Tokyo. The police unreasonably interfered with them and illegally arrested four people. Soon after, police arrested three more people in Bunkyo Ward for distributing similar leaflets.
    On the same day, when a Liberal Party candidate was giving a speech at a primary school in Shiba Ward, Tokyo, he was driven off the stage by boos from the crowd. The reactionary faction of the Liberal Party, enraged, took the opportunity to create beatings and destruction, falsely claiming it was "Communist Party sabotage." That night, the police arrested eight innocent people.

    吉田政府非法破坏日共竞选
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：日本吉田反动政府在大选期间加紧迫害日本共产党，非法破坏和阻挠日本共产党竞选。
    据国际新闻社讯，为了迫害日共，“日本警察已在全国范围内采取警戒措施”。十六日，一批学生和妇女等在东京文京区东京大学门前附近散发竞选传单，警察对他们进行无理干涉，并非法逮捕了四个人。不久以后，警察在文京区又逮捕了三个散发类似传单的人。
    同日，自由党的一个候选人在东京芝区某小学演说时，被群众的嘘声赶下台来。自由党反动派恼羞成怒，竟乘机制造殴打和捣毁事件，诬称这是“共产党破坏”。当晚警察逮捕了八名无辜者。
