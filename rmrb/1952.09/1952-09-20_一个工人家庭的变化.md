In residence number 122 of the Qixin Cement Plant worker's quarters in Tangshan, I visited an ordinary worker's family. The head of the family, Fan Shixun, is a 53-year-old veteran worker with 35 years of service. He has three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Fan Xiaoshan, works at the Tangshan State-owned Steel Plant. The second son, Fan Xiaolin, works at the Tangshan Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau. The youngest son and two daughters are studying at the Tangshan Workers' Children's School. Fan Shixun's wife and two daughters-in-law are responsible for household chores.

That day was Sunday, and Fan Shixun and his children were all at home, gathered around listening to Fan Xiaoshan read the newspaper. After I sat down, the first thing I asked about was the family's income and expenses. Fan Shixun counted on his fingers and told me: he and his eldest son Fan Xiaoshan have a monthly wage income of 1.7 million yuan. If you add the production over-quota bonus, it's even more. The biggest expense in the family life is food, which costs 800,000 yuan per month. Clothing costs an average of 300,000 yuan per month. The remaining money is saved in the bank as special purchase funds. Since last year, this money has been used to buy three watches, three bicycles, and miscellaneous furniture. Speaking of this, Fan Shixun pointed to the radio and the shining lacquered tables and chairs in his room and said, "These are all newly purchased!"

The new house they live in now, with fresh air and glass纱windows in the front and back, was allocated to him last fall. In the past, under the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, Fan Shixun lived in a dilapidated thatched house. When it rained, it didn't rain outside, but it rained inside. Several people shared one quilt, and the monthly salary couldn't buy a few斗of corn. Life was very painful. After liberation, both father and son achieved results in production and were elected as labor models, and their lives were greatly improved.

Speaking of the past, Fan Shixun spoke like a river that had burst its banks. He started working in the Qixin Cement Factory repairing airfields at the age of eighteen. Although his skills were good, he couldn't keep his job. At that time, capitalists often lowered wages by "dismissing" workers in order to make more money, so workers were always worried. In 1935, this unfortunate encounter finally fell on Fan Shixun's head. From then on, the family's livelihood was cut off. Fan Shixun worked as a porter one day and a stone cutter the next, but he still couldn't make ends meet. Although he returned to Qixin as a machine repair technician the following spring, his salary was cut in half. In 1944, Fan Xiaoshan went to the steel plant as an apprentice worker at the age of fifteen, but he was laid off in less than a year. Later, he worked as a temporary worker in the Kailuan Coal Mine, but he was only employed for one year before becoming unemployed again. Dismissal and unemployment attacked this worker's family like a plague, often leaving them with no means of survival.

The tragedy of this family did not end until 1949. As Fan Shixun said, "The Communist Party came, and I truly found my home." From then on, this family, which was about to be destroyed, began a new life. With the help of the People's Government, Fan Xiaoshan returned to the steel plant, and Fan Shixun's salary was readjusted. The father and son agreed to repay Chairman Mao by working hard in production. At first, Fan Xiaoshan did odd jobs in the steel plant, and then he was promoted to converter to learn steelmaking. Although the angle, wind pressure, and temperature were all unfamiliar to him, he humbly asked the old workers for advice and studied hard. In less than a year, Fan Xiaoshan was promoted from apprentice to formal steelworker, and later he was elected as the production team leader. This made him feel that his responsibility was even greater. It was not only important to do a good job in his own production, but more importantly, to do a good job in the production of the whole team. After Chairman Mao put forward the call for increasing production and practicing economy last winter, Fan Xiaoshan took the lead in mobilizing all the workers in the team to respond. At that time, the furnace blowing loss rate was 23%. Fan Xiaoshan thought, "To increase production and practice economy, we must work hard on this." He mobilized everyone to study the relationship between the furnace angle, wind pressure, iron content, and blowing loss. Whoever found a problem immediately wrote it down. After repeated research, they finally found the trick and created a new national record of a 10% blowing loss rate, saving the country 180,000 jin of rice wealth every month. Fan Xiaoshan's father, Fan Shixun, although old, also led all the workers to find tricks. At first, some workers couldn't understand the Qixin's campaign to increase production and practice economy. Fan Shixun said to everyone, "Although the factory is owned by the capitalists, the products are purchased by the state in a unified way, so reducing the cost of cement is directly saving wealth for the country." Under his patient explanation, the workers' production enthusiasm was improved. After everyone studied technology and improved operation methods, the number of workers required for作叮噹碾的肋条骨活计was reduced from 18 to only nine. After Fan Shixun improved the tools for the dust collector air box clamp, the daily production was increased from 20 to 100.

Now this happy worker's family is making winter purchase plans. In addition to making a new cotton-padded coat for each person, they also plan to add a new sweater for each person, and the elderly Fan Shixun will make a滩羊皮袄. Whenever he talked about his family's happy life, Fan Shixun always smiled from ear to ear. Finally, he said: "My life is beautiful enough now. First, I am no longer afraid of unemployment; second, I am no longer afraid of not having enough to eat. Our lives are carefree; 'unemployment' is already a thing of the past for my children. I believe that when my children grow up and work hard to build our new China, they will live a happier life than I do now."

    一个工人家庭的变化
    新华社记者  力夫
    在唐山启新洋灰厂工房一百二十二号住所里，我访问了一个普通的工人家庭。家庭主人范士勋是个有着三十五年工龄的五十三岁的老工人，他有三个儿子，两个姑娘，长子范晓山在唐山国营钢厂做工，次子范晓林在唐山市人民政府公安局工作，小儿子和两个姑娘在唐山职工子弟学校读书，范士勋的妻子和两个儿媳妇负责料理家务。
    那天是礼拜日，范士勋和孩子们都在家，正围拢在一起听范晓山读报。我坐下之后，首先询问的就是这家的收支状况，范士勋扳着手指告诉我：他和长子范晓山每月的工资收入是一百七十万元，若加上生产超额奖金比这还多。家庭生活中最大的开支是伙食费，每月需八十万元，服装费平均每月三十万元，余下的钱就做为特种购置费存入银行，从去年到现在曾用这批钱购置了三个手表，三辆自行车，和零零散散的家具。说到这里范士勋指着他屋里的收音机和漆得发光的桌椅说：“这些都是新置的！”
    现在他们住的这所空气新鲜、前后都是玻璃纱窗的新房，是去年秋后才分配给他的，过去在日寇和国民党统治时期，范士勋住的是破草房，下雨的时候，外边不下，屋里还下，几个人一床被子，每月的工资买不了几斗玉黍，生活是非常痛苦的。解放以后，父子两人在生产上有了成绩，都当选为劳动模范，生活也大大的提高了。
    谈到过去，范士勋像开了闸的河水，滔滔不绝地讲起来，他从十八岁就在启新洋灰工厂修机场做工，技术虽好，但却保不住饭碗，那时，资本家为了多赚钱经常以“解雇”工人来压低工资，因此工人们整天提心吊胆。一九三五年，这种不幸的遭遇，终于落在范士勋的头上了，从此全家的生活来路断绝了，范士勋今天当脚夫，明天打石子，干来干去还是糊不住口，虽然第二年春天回到启新当修理机器的技术工人，但是工资却少了一半。一九四四年，范晓山刚十五岁到钢厂做养成工，但是不到一年就被解雇了，后来到开滦煤矿做临时小工，也是只做了一年又失业了。解雇、失业一次一次像瘟疫似地袭击着这个工人家庭，使得他们经常生活无着。
    这个家庭的悲剧，直到一九四九年才结束了。正如范士勋所说“共产党来了，我才真正地找到家了”。从此这个将被毁灭的家庭，开始了新生。在人民政府的帮助下范晓山又回到了钢厂，范士勋的工资重新得到了调整。父子二人相约：决心以努力生产来报答毛主席。开初范晓山在钢厂做杂工，后提到转炉学炼钢，虽然角度、风压、温度对他都是陌生的东西，但他却虚心地向老工人请教，用心学习。这样不到一年，范晓山就由学徒工提升为正式炼钢工人了，后又被选为生产小组长，这样他感到自己的责任更加重大了，不仅自己要把生产搞好，更重要的是把全组生产搞好。去年冬季毛主席提出增产节约的号召后，范晓山就带动全组工友首先响应。当时炉子的吹损率是百分之二十三，范晓山想：“要增产节约必须从这上面下功夫”，他发动大家研究炉子的角度、风压、铁水量和吹损的关系，谁发现问题就立刻记下来，经过这样反复研究，他们终于找到了窍门，创造了吹损率百分之十的全国新纪录，每月为国家节省十八万斤米的财富。范晓山的父亲范士勋，虽然年纪老了，也带动全体工友找窍门，开始有些工人对启新开展增产节约运动搞不通，范士勋对大家说：“厂子虽是资本家的，但产品却由国家统一收购，所以降低洋灰成本，就是直接为国家节省财富。”在他的耐心解释下，工人生产情绪提高了，经过大家研究技术、改进操作方法，使作叮噹碾的肋条骨活计由过去每个需要十八个工降到只用九个工。收尘器风箱卡子，经过范士勋改进工具，由每天生产二十个提高到一百个。
    现在这个幸福的工人家庭，正在做冬季的购置计划，除每人做一套新棉衣外，他们还计划每人添一件新毛衣，年老的范士勋则作一件滩羊皮袄。每逢谈到他家庭的幸福生活，范士勋总是笑得合不上嘴，最后他说：“我现在的生活够美了，第一不再怕失业；第二不再怕没有饭吃。我们的生活是无忧无虑；‘失业’对孩子们来说已经是过去的东西了，我相信我的孩子们长大了，为建设咱们的新中国好好劳动，都会过着比我现在更幸福的生活。”
