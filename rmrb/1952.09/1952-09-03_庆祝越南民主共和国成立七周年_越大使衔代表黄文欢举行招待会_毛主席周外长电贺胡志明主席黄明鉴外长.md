Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Hoang Van Hoan, Ambassador-Rank Representative of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, held a reception in Beijing on the evening of the 2nd to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Those invited to attend included: Liu Shaoqi and Li Jishen, Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government; Guo Moruo and Huang Yanpei, Vice Premiers of the Government Administration Council; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government; and more than 200 people including heads of various departments of the Central People's Government, responsible persons of various democratic parties, and Zhang Youyu, Vice Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government.

Also invited to attend were diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China.

At the beginning of the reception, Ambassador Hoang Van Hoan delivered a speech. After describing the significant achievements made by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in various fields over the past seven years since its founding, he said: The more the French colonialists and American imperialist interventionists suffer devastating defeats, the more brutal and savage they become, and the more frantically they burn, kill, and plunder, attempting to make a desperate struggle. Therefore, the Vietnamese people's resistance war will have to go through a difficult period, but the Vietnamese people can shoulder this arduous task. Because they are just, they are united as one, and they have the support of peace-loving people all over the world, especially the support of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. They will surely achieve victory, and they are striding towards final victory.

Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi then delivered a congratulatory speech. He said: Today is the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and I would like to extend my heartfelt and warm congratulations to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Vietnam, the friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Vietnamese people have been further consolidated and developed. While building our motherland and carrying out the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, the Chinese people have always been concerned with sympathy about the achievements of the Vietnamese people in their struggle for national independence and liberation. The victories of the Chinese and Vietnamese people have made a powerful contribution to the cause of defending peace in Asia and the world. I firmly believe that the struggle for independence and liberation carried out by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party will achieve final victory through continuous efforts, so that the Vietnamese people can completely get rid of the shackles of imperialism and build their own independent, peaceful, and democratic life.

Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi finally wished: Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Vietnamese people!

The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

In addition, Chairman Mao Zedong and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government sent telegrams to President Ho Chi Minh and Foreign Minister Hoang Minh Giam of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on August 29, congratulating them on the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    招待会开始时，大使衔黄文欢代表首先致辞。他在叙述越南民主共和国成立七年来在各方面的重大成就后说：法国殖民主义者和美帝国主义干涉者越遭受惨重的失败，他们就越发残暴野蛮，越发疯狂地烧、杀、掳掠，企图作垂死的挣扎。因此越南人民的抗战还要经过一段艰苦的历程，但越南人民是担当得起这种艰巨的任务的。因为他们是正义的，是全国一致的，是得到全世界爱好和平的人民的支持，特别是苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的支持的。他们一定要获得胜利，而且正大踏步走上最后胜利的道路。
    刘少奇副主席继起致祝词。他说：今天是越南民主共和国成立七周年纪念日，我谨代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民向越南民主共和国政府及越南人民致以衷心的、热烈的祝贺。中越两国建交以来，中国人民与越南人民间的友好合作关系，业已获得进一步的巩固和发展。中国人民在建设祖国与进行抗美援朝斗争的同时，经常以同情的心情关注越南人民在争取民族独立和解放的斗争中的成就。中越两国人民的胜利，业已对保卫亚洲与世界和平的事业，作了有力的贡献。我深信：越南人民在越南劳动党领导下所进行的独立解放斗争，将由于不断的努力而取得最后的胜利，从而使越南人民完全摆脱帝国主义的枷锁，建设自己独立、和平与民主的生活。
    刘少奇副主席最后祝：中越两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    招待会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。
    又讯：我国中央人民政府毛泽东主席和周恩来外交部长于八月二十九日分别致电越南民主共和国主席胡志明和外交部长黄明鉴，祝贺越南民主共和国成立七周年纪念日。
