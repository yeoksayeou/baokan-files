    We Fight to Defend Peace
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Air Force, Zhao Baotong

    I am an ordinary Chinese youth. To defend my motherland and world peace, I went to Korea to fight the heinous American air bandits, shooting down and damaging eight American aircraft. Now, as the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference is about to be held, I would like to talk about my feelings and thoughts as an air force soldier fighting for peace.

    In Korea, when we fly to the high altitude near the Yalu River, we can see the border of our motherland across the river, with thousands of lights at night and a vast expanse of green like the sea during the day, a scene of prosperity. But looking back at the land of Korea, it is full of rubble, and many places are filled with the flames of American incendiary bombs. This cannot but make us extremely angry. We pilots often talk about it together: if it weren't for American imperialism launching a war, Korea could be built like our motherland; if it weren't for American imperialism launching a war, we could also participate in the construction in our motherland, gradually building our motherland as beautiful as the Soviet Union, as beautiful as a garden; we could fly planes to open up air routes on the vast land of the motherland, survey the vast forests, blow up the ice dams of the Yellow River, and eliminate locusts... After work, we can go to parks and clubs to play as we please. We can also continue to study at the aviation academy for further studies. How wonderful all this would be. But American imperialism won't let us do that! It occupied our country's Taiwan, it burned the flames of war to our country's doorstep, and it is planning to burn towards our mainland and towards the whole world. How can we not put it out and contain it!

    We pilots all love children very much. In the house where we live, it is full of children's photos, some sent from the motherland, and some cut from pictorials. They are all chubby and fair, learning, playing, and smiling at us. We think of our childhood, not having enough to eat or wear, like green grass crushed by a big stone. Now, the children of New China are so happy. How can we let American bombs fall on their heads! We often say to the children in these photos: we must let you grow up like flowers, in full sunshine and air; the heavy burden, our generation of young and middle-aged people must bear it on our shoulders.

    This time when I returned to the peaceful motherland, I was filled with surprise and joy when I saw the achievements in all aspects. How fast our motherland is being built, how beautiful our people's lives are! At Tianjin Railway Station, I heard a worker comrade tell me that the Tianjin Municipal People's Government built 10,000 new houses for workers. When I arrived in Beijing, in the beautiful suburbs of the capital, I saw the new Beijing under construction—an endless stretch of red and gray buildings and tall, dense construction frames in the green fields. This is in stark contrast to the broken walls and ruins on the Korean front, leaving a strong impression in my heart. I more clearly realized the responsibility of our Volunteer Air Force soldiers—we must never let the bombs of American imperialism fall on these peaceful buildings of the motherland. When we go to battle with this kind of mood, we feel that there is an invincible force behind us supporting us. Recently, I watched with the greatest excitement various performances of the Chinese People's Liberation Army at the "August 1st" Sports Games. The athletes' strong physique, agile movements, skilled techniques, high degree of organization and calm and brave spirit, as well as the various achievements of the entire army's cultural and artistic fronts, made me see a strong modern national defense force growing. This is the most powerful pillar for us to defend our motherland and defend peace in the East. I also saw the great power shown by our people in the increase production and economy movement and the patriotic health movement. I visited a steel plant, and I saw worker brothers working in the high temperature of over 100 degrees, with sparks almost splashing on them, they were working bravely. I heard that this factory's increase in production and economy this year is worth several hundred billion yuan. In Beijing, I saw the miracle of summer—eliminating flies and mosquitoes. Our people across the country defeated the American imperialist bacteriological warfare that threatened world security. I am truly proud of our motherland and people.

    Not only that, but we also feel that the peace-loving people all over the world are supporting us. From one side of the earth to the other, peace-loving people all over the world demand an end to the Korean War, demand an end to the barbaric bombing by the United States, demand an end to bacteriological warfare, and demand an end to wars of aggression. The demands of these people are consistent with our demands. Because our operations are also to stop aggression and to save peace. We have never thought and will never think of bombing San Francisco and New York, but we will never allow others to invade our country and our neighbor Korea.

    Representatives of peace-loving people from Asian and Pacific countries will hold the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference in Beijing. This conference represents the hope of the people of all countries to defend peace. We hope that this conference can more broadly unite the peace-loving people of Asian and Pacific countries to jointly stop imperialist aggression, defend peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region, so that the people of all countries can strive to build their own peaceful lives.

    我们为保卫和平而战斗
    中国人民志愿军空军战斗英雄　赵宝桐
    我是一个中国的普通青年，为着保卫祖国、保卫世界和平，我到达朝鲜和万恶的美国空中强盗作战，打落、打伤了八架美国飞机。现在，当亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将举行的时候，我愿意来谈一谈我——一个为和平而战斗的空军战士的心情和感想。
    在朝鲜，当我们飞到临近鸭绿江的高空时，我们就可以看到江对岸的祖国边疆，晚上万家灯火，白天万里碧绿似海，一片繁荣景象。可是回过头来看看朝鲜的土地上，却到处是瓦砾堆，许多地方弥漫着美国燃烧弹的火焰。这不能不使我们万分愤怒。我们飞行员常常在一起谈论着：要不是美帝国主义发动战争，朝鲜还不是可以和我们的祖国一样地建设；要不是美帝国主义发动战争，我们也可以在祖国参加建设，逐步地把祖国建设得像苏联一样，像花园一样美丽；我们可以架着飞机在辽阔的祖国土地上开辟航线，在广大的森林上作测量，去炸开黄河的冰坝，去消灭蝗虫……工作完了，我们可以随便到公园、到俱乐部去玩。我们还可以继续到航空学院去深造。这一切该多好呵。可是美帝国主义不叫我们这样做！它侵占了我国的台湾，它把战火烧到了我国的大门口，还计划着要烧向我国大陆，烧向全世界，我们怎能不去把它扑灭、遏止呢！
    我们飞行员们都很爱儿童。在我们住的屋子里，满挂着儿童的照片，有从祖国寄来的，也有从画报上剪下来的。他们一个个白白胖胖，在学习，在游戏，在向着我们笑。我们想起我们的儿童时代，吃不饱、穿不暖，像被大石头压着的青草。现在，新中国的儿童多么幸福。怎能让美国的炸弹丢到他们头上呢！我们常常对着这些照片上的儿童说：要让你们像鲜花一样地、在充分的阳光和空气中成长起来；千斤重担，我们这一代青年人和壮年人要用肩膀去承受。
    我这次回到和平的祖国，看到各方面的成就，我的心里充满着惊异和欢乐。我们的祖国建设得多么快，我们人民的生活多么美！在天津车站，我听到一个工人同志告诉我，天津市人民政府给工人盖了一万间新房子。到了北京，在美丽的首都郊外，我又看到正在建设中的新北京——绿色原野中一片望不断的红色和灰色的楼房和高高的密密的建筑架子。这和朝鲜前线的断墙残壁，成为鲜明的对比，在我心中留下强烈的印象。我更明显地想到我们志愿军空军战士的责任——决不能让美帝国主义的炸弹落到祖国这些和平的建筑物上来。我们怀着这样的心情去作战时，我们感到我们背后有一股无敌的力量在支持着我们。最近我带着最大的兴奋看到了我国人民解放军在“八一”体育运动大会的各种表演。运动员们壮健的体格，灵敏的动作，熟练的技术，高度的组织性和沉着勇敢的精神，以及全军文化、文艺战线的各种成就，使我看到一支强大的现代化的国防军正在成长。这是我们保卫祖国、保卫东方和平最有力的支柱。我也看到了我国人民在增产节约运动和爱国卫生运动中所表现的伟大力量。我参观了一家炼钢厂，我看到工人兄弟在一百度以上的高温中坚持工作，火花几乎飞溅到他们身上，他们英勇地劳动着。我听说这个厂今年增产节约的价值有好几千亿元。在北京，我看到了夏天的奇迹——消灭了苍蝇和蚊子。我们全国人民把美帝国主义威胁全世界安全的细菌战打败了。我真以我们的祖国和人民而自豪。
    不光是这样，我们也感到全世界爱好和平的人民在支持我们。从地球的这一边到那一边，全世界爱好和平的人民要求结束朝鲜战争，要求制止美国的野蛮轰炸，要求制止细菌战，要求制止侵略战争。这些人的要求和我们的要求是一致的。因为我们的作战也是为了制止侵略，为了拯救和平。我们从来没有也永远不会想到要去轰炸旧金山和纽约，但我们也绝不许别人来侵犯我国和我们的邻邦朝鲜。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平人士的代表将在北京举行亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，这个会议代表着各国人民要求保卫和平的希望。我们希望这次会议能够更广泛地团结亚洲、太平洋区域各国爱好和平的人民，共同来制止帝国主义的侵略，保卫亚洲、太平洋区域和平与安全，使各国人民都能努力去建设自己的和平生活。
