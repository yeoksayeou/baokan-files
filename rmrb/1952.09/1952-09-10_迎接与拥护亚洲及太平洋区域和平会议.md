From the villagers of Xigou Village, Pingshun County, and members of the Li Shunda Production Cooperative:

    Editor: We are farmers who work in the fields all day long. Like peace-loving people all over the world, we all yearn for peace and hate war. During the years of the Japanese imperialist invasion, seventeen people in our Xigou Village were killed, fifty-seven houses were burned down, and production was destroyed beyond recognition. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our production has increased unprecedentedly, and our lives have greatly improved. We are working hard to realize our three-year construction plan to enhance the national defense and economic strength of our motherland, to make our lives better, and to make our village more beautiful.

    We are all very concerned about the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference that will soon be held in Beijing. We have studied the declaration of the Preparatory Committee for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and every word in it is exactly what we want. I remember there are two sentences in this declaration: "Peace cannot be waited for; peace requires peace-loving people to unite and strive for it." "Combined with peace-loving people in other regions of the world who have the same aspirations, the people of Asia and the Pacific region are able to make peace triumph over war." This is very right. In order to work together with the people of the whole country and the people of the entire Asian and Pacific region to strive for peace, all the masses in our village held a "Welcoming and Supporting the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference" in late August, and decided to take the following specific measures as a gift to the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    First, launch an Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference Propaganda Week. Vigorously study and publicize the relevant documents and articles of the conference, so that every household knows about it and everyone knows about it, and further enhance everyone's political awareness of defending world peace.

    Second, in order to enhance the strength of defending peace, we have decided to implement the patriotic production increase campaign throughout the year's production work. We have now formulated eight plans for autumn production this year and are working hard to implement them. We must strive to complete our village's three-year construction plan ahead of schedule.
　　　　　　　The entire masses of Xigou Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi, and all members of the Li Shunda Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative

We are determined to do our best to publicize the peace conference
    Editor: We are students of Beijing Normal University. Today, as the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is about to be held in Beijing, everyone feels particularly excited and happy.

    Our childhood and adolescence were spent in days of war. The invasion of Japanese imperialism caused us to suffer from hunger, lack of education, and wandering; the cruel rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries buried us in fluctuating prices and an unstable life. It has only been three years since liberation, and we have been freed from the pain of being out of school and unemployed, and our lives are improving day by day. Now, the government is using great efforts to take care of us. Before the summer vacation came this year, the Party and the government prepared conditions for us to rest. After the exams, some participated in the Beidaihe seaside travel team, and some went to Tanzhe Temple in western Beijing for camping. Everyone was breathing and singing freely on the beautiful coast and in the depths of the jungle of the motherland. In Tanzhe Temple, we lived with militiamen who had been fighting guerrillas in that area since 1944. They kindly and in detail told us their struggle stories. A hero of the guerrilla war who had persisted in the War of Resistance Against Japan in central Hebei said to us: "You are very happy today, and the future will be even better; remember, this was exchanged for by the blood of countless martyrs!" In Beidaihe, one day we went to a farmer's house to play, and an old lady mentioned her ten-month-old nephew. She said, "He was born in a peaceful year, so I named him 'Peace'." Indeed, the blood of martyrs has flowed on every inch of our motherland's beautiful land, and how much people love their happy lives!

    In the years of struggle for peace, we students have also contributed a lot of strength, and today we must inherit this glorious tradition. The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, which will be held in Beijing, is closely related to us. We are determined to do our best to carry out publicity work widely and deeply, and mobilize everyone to participate in the struggle to defend peace.

### 迎接与拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议

    迎接与拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    平顺西沟村农民和李顺达生产合作社社员召开大会
    编辑同志：我们是整天在田地里劳动着的农民。和全世界爱好和平的人民一样，大家都渴望和平，痛恨战争。在日本帝国主义者入侵的年代里，我们西沟村有十七口人被杀死，房子被烧毁了五十七间，生产破坏得不成样子。解放以后，在共产党的领导下，我们的生产空前提高，生活大大改善，我们正在努力实现我们的三年建设计划，以增强祖国的国防力量和经济力量，使我们的生活过得更美好，使我们的村庄变得更美丽。
    我们都非常关心快要在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。我们曾经学习了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的宣言，那上面的每一句话，都正合我们的心意。记得在这个宣言里有这样两段话：“和平不能坐待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。”“与世界其他地区抱有同样愿望的爱好和平的人民结合在一起，亚洲及太平洋区域的人民是能够使和平战胜战争的。”这话很对。为了和全国人民以及全亚洲及太平洋区域的人民一道共同争取和平，我们全村的群众在八月底召开了“迎接与拥护亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议大会”，决定以下列具体措施，作为对亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的献礼。
    第一，开展亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议宣传周。大力学习与宣传会议的有关文件和文章，做到家喻户晓，人人皆知，进一步提高大家保卫世界和平的政治觉悟。
    第二，为了增强保卫和平的力量，我们决定把爱国增产竞赛运动贯彻到全年的生产工作中去，现在已经订出今年秋季生产的八项计划，正在努力贯彻实施。我们要争取提前完成我村的三年建设计划。　
　　　　　　　山西平顺县西沟村全体群众和李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社全体社员
    我们决心尽力作好和平会议的宣传工作
    编辑同志：我们是北京师范大学的学生。在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在北京召开的今天，大家都觉得特别兴奋和愉快。
    我们的童年和少年时代，都是在战火弥漫的日子里度过的。日本帝国主义的侵略，使我们遭受到饥饿、失学和流浪的苦难；国民党反动派的残酷统治，把我们埋没在物价波动和动荡不安的生活里。解放才三年，我们就摆脱了失学、失业的痛苦，生活也一天天上升。现在，政府又用很大的力量来照顾我们。今年暑假还没有到来，党和政府就给我们准备好了休息的条件。考试完后，有的参加了北戴河海滨旅行队，有的就到京西的檀柘寺去露营，大家都在祖国美丽的海边和丛林深处尽情地呼吸和歌唱。在檀柘寺，我们和从一九四四年起就在那一带打过游击的民兵们生活在一起，他们亲切地、详细地给我们讲述自己的斗争故事。一位曾在冀中坚持抗日的游击战争英雄对我们说：“你们今天是很幸福的，前途更会美好；要记住，这是无数烈士的鲜血换来的！”在北戴河，有一天我们到一个农民家去玩，一位老太太提起了她才满十个月的外甥，她说：“他生在和平的年头里，我就给他取名叫‘和平’。”的确，在我们祖国的每一寸美丽土地上都流过烈士们的鲜血，而人们是如何热爱着自己的幸福生活啊！
    在为和平事业而斗争的年月里，我们学生也曾经贡献过不少的力量，今天我们还要继承这种光荣的传统。将要在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，和我们有着密切的关系，我们决心尽自己的力量，广泛而深入地作好宣传工作，动员大家都来参加保卫和平的斗争。
