Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: London Worker’s Daily reporter Alan Winnington reported from Panmunjom on the 4th: The US chief negotiator, Harrison, today threatened to expand germ warfare against North Korea. He told General Nam Il that unless the Korean-Chinese side abandoned their prisoners of war and accepted the US ultimatum, "the people of North Korea will suffer from disease" in addition to suffering all kinds of war horrors from the US. Harrison's speech was a shocking hodgepodge, piecing together threatening propaganda aimed at creating divisions between the Korean and Chinese people and vile attacks on "communism." He had no intention of negotiating the only issue preventing the signing of the armistice agreement and insisted on adjourning for another week. General Nam Il told him that no matter how many lies, they could not cover up the fact that the Americans were trying to detain prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, delaying negotiations, and prolonging the war. "You can only represent a minority group."

General Nam Il told Harrison: "The people of your so-called allies, as well as the people of your own country, are increasingly strongly opposed to you, and they demand an immediate armistice. They know that this war of aggression against Korea is unjust. You are suffering the opposition of the people of all countries in the world." General Nam Il said that clumsy efforts to undermine the friendship between the Korean and Chinese people only showed your desperation. "You are refusing an armistice and prolonging the war for the benefit of a small group of warmongers. Since May of this year alone, you have lost more than 60,000 people in combat, including 30,000 Americans." These people were sacrificed only so that a few arms dealers could extract huge war profits. Although the US side is forced to negotiate, they still do not want to seek peace. "You are sacrificing the lives of soldiers from more than a dozen countries and destroying the happiness of peace-loving people." General Nam Il urged Harrison to re-check the list of prisoners of war and repatriate the prisoners in accordance with the Geneva Convention and the draft armistice agreement. Harrison's speech showed their true attitude towards the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war they were trying to detain. He said that among the prisoners of war, "there are only a few Chinese - ordinary people, most of whom are inferior people." After making this shameless and racially prejudiced slander, he then threatened that unless the Korean-Chinese side surrendered to the US side, the US side would destroy all the people of North Korea. It was at this time that he carelessly mentioned spreading germs. He hypocritically expressed sympathy for the civilians massacred by the US Air Force, and he also asked the Korean-Chinese side: "Don't you care about the happiness of the North Koreans at all?" After the Korean-Chinese side protested against the US side for killing and wounding many Korean-Chinese prisoners of war in the past week, Harrison actually said without thinking: "Facts speak louder than words," and accused the Korean-Chinese side of not wanting peace, which is extremely shameless.

Two weeks ago, he also said that the Korean-Chinese side wanted peace only because they were unwilling to pay the price demanded by the US side. Now, Harrison has a new trick: he said that he is prepared to implement the provisions of Article 51 of the armistice agreement, but the US side only detains 83,000 prisoners. General Nam Il immediately refuted him, saying that the US side must repatriate approximately 116,000 prisoners of war, including 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war. There was no progress in the negotiations. The US side only asked for another week's adjournment to sabotage the negotiations, while they tried to spread germs to the people of North Korea and destroy their families.

### 哈利逊竟在四日会上扬言扩大进行细菌战

    哈利逊竟在四日会上扬言扩大进行细菌战
    【新华社四日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿四日自板门店报道：美国首席谈判代表哈利逊今天扬言要扩大对北朝鲜的细菌战。他告诉南日将军说，除非朝中方面放弃他们的被俘人员并接受美国的最后通牒，否则，除了遭受美国的各种战争恐怖以外，“北朝鲜人民将要遭受疾病的侵扰”。哈利逊的发言是一盘惊人的大杂烩，它把以制造朝中人民之间的分歧为目的的威胁宣传和对“共产主义”的卑鄙攻击都拼凑在一起了。他根本不打算谈判使停战协定不能签订的唯一的问题，并坚持再休会一周。南日将军告诉他说，无论多少谎言，都不能掩盖这一事实：美国人企图扣留朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军被俘人员，拖延谈判，延长战争。“你只能代表一个少数集团”。
    南日将军告哈利逊说：“你们的所谓盟国的人民以及你们本国的人民，正日益强烈地反对你们，他们要求立即停战。他们知道这个侵略朝鲜的战争是非正义的。你们正遭受全世界各国人民的反对。”南日将军说，破坏朝中人民友谊的笨拙努力只是表示了你们的绝望而已。“你们为了一小撮战争贩子的利益，拒绝停战和延长战争。单是自本年五月以来，你们在战斗中就损失了六万多人，其中有三万美国人。”这些人只是为了使少数军火商人能够榨取到庞大的战争利润而牺牲的。虽然美方被迫进行谈判，但他们仍不想谋求和平。“你们是不惜牺牲十几个国家的士兵的生命及破坏和平人民的幸福的。”南日将军力促哈利逊重新核对战俘名单，并按照日内瓦公约和停战协定草案遣返俘虏。哈利逊的发言表明了他们对待他们企图扣留的朝中方面被俘人员的真正态度。他说，被俘人员中“只有少数中国人——普普通通的人，其中多半是下等人。”他进行了这种无耻的抱有种族成见的诽谤以后，接着威胁说，除非朝中方面向美方屈服，否则美方将毁灭所有北朝鲜老百姓。就在这个时候，他不留心说出了撒布病菌的事。他假惺惺地对被美国空军屠杀的平民表示同情，他还问朝中方面说：“难道你们毫不关心北朝鲜人的幸福吗？”在朝中方面已就美方在过去一周中打死打伤许多朝中方面被俘人员提出抗议以后，哈利逊竟然不假思索地说：“事实胜于雄辩。”并指责朝中方面不希望和平，这真是无耻之尤。
    两周前，他还说，朝中方面希望和平只是不愿付出美方所要求的代价。现在，哈利逊耍了一个新花样：他说，他准备实行停战协定第五十一款的条文，但是美方所拘留的俘虏只有八万三千名。南日将军当即驳斥他说，美方必须遣返大约十一万六千名被俘人员，其中包括两万名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。谈判毫无进展。美方只要求再休会一周来破坏谈判，同时他们试图对北朝鲜的老百姓撒布病菌并使他们家破人亡。
