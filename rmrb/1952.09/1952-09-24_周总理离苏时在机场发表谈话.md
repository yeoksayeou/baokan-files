Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 23rd: Premier of the State Administration Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai, delivered the following speech at the airport on September 22nd upon leaving Moscow:

Dear Comrades:

Before the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China leaves Moscow today, I would like to express, on behalf of the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman Mao Zedong, our heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Marshal Stalin for their warm reception and kind attention.

Since our arrival in Moscow, the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, with Comrade Stalin's personal participation, have successfully completed discussions on important political and economic issues between the two countries, and have issued a joint communiqué on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Chinese government, and exchanged notes on extending the term of joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base. This has further developed and consolidated the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Thus, we have completed the glorious task entrusted by Chairman Mao Zedong.

During our stay in the Soviet Union, the members of our delegation visited various industrial construction projects in Moscow, and also visited the heroic city of Stalingrad and the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. During our visits, we personally witnessed the great Soviet people, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, victoriously advancing to a new stage of communist construction with an unprecedented conscious labor enthusiasm and highly advanced technology. Such brilliant construction has brought new encouragement to the Chinese people and the working people of the world, as well as to the Soviet people, regarding the bright future of communism.

We firmly believe that the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union will grow stronger day by day and will develop for generations to come. Any provocation and sabotage against such a great friendship will undoubtedly be defeated under the united strength of the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The powerful Sino-Soviet alliance is the most powerful guarantee for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

Long live the great Soviet people!

Long live Comrade Stalin, the most beloved friend and mentor of the Chinese people and the great leader of the working people of the world!

    周总理离苏时在机场发表谈话
    【新华社莫斯科二十三日电】我中央人民政府政务院总理兼外交部部长周恩来在二十二日离开莫斯科时，在机场发表了下列谈话：亲爱的同志们：
    在中华人民共和国政府代表团今天离开莫斯科之前，我谨代表中国人民、中华人民共和国政府和毛泽东主席，向伟大的苏联人民、苏联政府和斯大林大元帅对于我们的热烈招待和亲切关怀，表示衷心的感谢。
    自从我们到达莫斯科以来，中华人民共和国政府代表团与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府之间，在斯大林同志亲自参加之下，业已圆满地完成了有关两国重要政治问题与经济问题的商谈，并发表了关于中国长春铁路移交中国政府的联合公告，和交换了延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的照会。这样就使中苏两国的友好合作得到了进一步的发展和巩固。我们因之完成了毛泽东主席所委托的光荣任务。
    在留驻苏联期间，我们代表团同人曾在莫斯科参观了各种工业建设，并同赴斯大林格勒英雄之城与列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河进行访问。在参观和访问中，我们亲眼看见伟大的苏联人民在斯大林同志领导之下，以人类历史上空前未有的自觉的劳动热忱和高度的先进技术，胜利地走向共产主义建设的新阶段。这样辉煌建设，不仅为苏联人民，同样为中国人民和全世界劳动人民，带来了对于共产主义光明前途的新的鼓舞。
    我们深信中苏两国牢不可破的伟大友谊将要日益发展，而且要世世代代地发展下去。任何对于这样伟大友谊的挑拨和破坏，在中苏两国人民团结力量的打击之下，必将归于失败无疑。强大的中苏友好同盟是维护远东与世界和平的最有力的保证。
    伟大的苏联人民万岁！
    中国人民最亲爱的朋友和导师、全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖斯大林同志万岁！
