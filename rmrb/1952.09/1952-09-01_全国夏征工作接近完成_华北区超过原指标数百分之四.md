    National Summer Grain Collection Work Nearing Completion
    North China Region Exceeds Original Target by Four Percent
    [By Our Own Correspondent] The summer grain collection work across the country this year, with the exception of a few early rice producing areas where collection is still underway due to later harvests, has been largely completed in most regions. The collected public grain has mostly been put into storage. Statistics as of mid-August show that the North China region exceeded its original target by four percent, the Southwest region completed 92.88 percent of its original target, the Central South region completed about 80 percent, the East China region completed about 90 percent, and the Northwest region, due to the later wheat harvest, has only completed about 40 percent. Nationwide, over 80 percent of the summer grain collection target has been completed.
    This year's summer grain collection work was carried out on the foundation of the victory of the "Three-Anti" campaign. In the "Three-Anti" campaign, the leading organs in various regions examined and criticized the erroneous ideological styles of bureaucratism, empiricism, and departmentalism in the past collection work, laying a good ideological foundation for correctly implementing the collection policy. The heads of governments and finance departments at all levels personally led and oversaw the collection and inspection work. During the collection period, relevant central organs dispatched four investigation teams to work in the five provinces of Henan, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, and Pingyuan; the financial leading organs of the Northwest, East China, North China and other major administrative regions dispatched a total of fifteen inspection teams to the provinces under their jurisdiction for inspection. Various provinces also sent many cadres to the special zones and counties to supervise and inspect. Most provinces appropriately arranged summer tasks such as summer grain collection and drought resistance, and summer planting, enabling various tasks to be carried out in conjunction. Under the leadership of the Provincial Financial and Economic Committees, Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi and other provinces organized "Grain Collection and Purchasing Committees" or "Joint Offices" to closely integrate the four tasks of grain collection, purchasing, recovering loans, and bringing industrial products to the countryside, greatly improving collection efficiency. The summer grain collection work in Gansu and Ningxia provinces in the Northwest region was carried out in conjunction with the review of land reform work. During the summer grain collection process, land was verified and output was determined. In Shaanxi, inter-regional output assessments were implemented in bordering areas to balance the burden. Before the collection, many counties convened people's representatives' conferences from all walks of life to discuss the summer grain collection issue, and widely publicized the burden policy among the masses, enhancing the masses' understanding. For example, in Baodi County, Hebei, due to a further understanding of the burden policy, the masses in 292 villages voluntarily reported 1.23 million catties of hidden wheat field output before the collection. In the process of summer grain collection, various regions correctly implemented the policy of verifying fields and determining output, calculating collection rates accordingly, and legally reducing or exempting taxes, and in accordance with the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, abolished surcharges, making the burden on the broad masses of farmers more fair and reasonable, and greatly boosting farmers' enthusiasm for paying grain.
    In the summer grain collection and storage work, various regions strengthened organizational work and shortened the collection time. Most regions signed storage contracts before the collection, strengthening the organization and planning of the grain collection work, resulting in an unprecedented increase in storage efficiency. For example, Henan Province comprehensively promoted storage contracts, with farmers' representatives, warehouses, and collection departments determining the location, time, order, quantity, and grain quality standards for grain payment, which were jointly observed by both parties. In order to implement the contract, farmers in various townships in the Second District of Suixian County, Henan, voluntarily formed grain payment teams and public grain inspection groups, implementing "three sunnings, three siftings, and three inspections" to ensure that the grain quality was "dry, clean, and full." The grain collected in Shandong Province generally had a moisture content of no more than 12.5 percent and an impurity content of no more than 0.5 percent. In Huangzhuang Township, Xuchang County, Henan, all grain delivery vehicles were numbered, arranged in order, and entered the warehouse sequentially, maintaining order. Pingyuan, Hebei and other provinces implemented a collection and hired transportation method, increasing transportation efficiency by 3.25 times compared to the past.
    In order to tighten collection procedures, some areas in East China and Central South adopted the method of centralized compilation of books and strings (triplicate forms) at the county and district levels. In Laiyang County, Shandong, the county government centrally compiled public grain registers, resulting in a reduction in the error rate from 2.09 percent last year to just over 0.0005 percent, and increasing the efficiency of register compilation and form filling by 4.4 times.
    In this year's summer grain collection work, individual regions still experienced violations of policies. Some cadres mistakenly proposed the method of "calculating collection rates for the whole year and contracting summer tasks," resulting in the bias of "heavy summer and light autumn" or "light summer and heavy autumn." In some counties and districts, summer output accounted for 34 percent of the total annual output, while the summer tax amount reached 70 percent of the total annual tax amount. Some regions allocated reduction and exemption tasks at each level, resulting in average reduction and exemption and failure to reduce where necessary. In addition, individual regions did not comply with "delivery contracts," failing to pay grain on time, in order, or along designated routes, resulting in casualties of people and animals. These are issues that should be vigorously corrected in future agricultural tax collection.

### 全国夏征工作接近完成  华北区超过原指标数百分之四

    全国夏征工作接近完成
    华北区超过原指标数百分之四
    【本报讯】今年全国各地夏征工作，除少数早稻产区因收获较晚尚在征收外，大部地区征收工作已经完成。征收公粮已大部入仓。截至八月中旬的统计：华北区夏征超过原定指标数的百分之四，西南区完成原定指标数的百分之九十二点八八，中南区完成百分之八十左右，华东区完成百分之九十左右，西北区因麦收较晚，现仅完成百分之四十左右。全国各地总计已完成夏征任务指标数的百分之八十以上。
    今年的夏征工作是在“三反”运动的胜利基础上进行的。各地领导机关在“三反”运动中检查、批判了过去征收工作中的官僚主义、经验主义、本位主义的错误思想作风，给正确地贯彻征收政策打下了良好的思想基础。各级政府及财政部门的首长都亲自领导、掌握了征收检查工作。在征收期间，中央有关机关派出四个考察组分赴河南、安徽、山东、河北、平原五省工作；西北、华东、华北等大行政区的财政领导机关，共计派出十五个检查组，分赴所辖省份，进行检查。各省也派出了不少干部分赴专区、县督促检查。大部分省份适当安排了夏征和抗旱、夏种等夏季工作，使各种工作得以结合进行。河北、平原、山西等省在省财政经济委员会领导下，组织了“征收收购委员会”或“联合办公室”，把征收、收购、收回贷款和工业品下乡四大工作密切结合起来，使征收效率大大提高。西北区甘肃、宁夏两省的夏征工作，是结合土地改革复查工作进行的。在夏征过程中查实了土地，定好了产量。陕西各地并在交界地区，实行联评产量，以平衡负担。在征收前，许多县召开了各界人民代表会，讨论夏征问题，并在群众中广泛宣传负担政策，提高了群众的认识。例如，河北宝坻县二百九十二个村的群众由于进一步认识了负担政策，在征收前自动报出隐瞒了的麦田产量一百二十三万斤。各地在夏征过程中正确贯彻了查田定产、依率计征、依法减免的方针，并遵照中央人民政府政务院的指示，取消了附加，广大农民的负担更加公平合理，农民缴粮积极性极为高涨。
    各地在夏征入库工作中，加强了组织工作，缩短了征收时间。大部分地区在征收前都签订了入库合同，加强了征粮工作的组织性和计划性，使入库效率空前提高。如河南省全面推行了入库合同，由农民代表和仓库、征收部门确定了缴粮地点、时间、次序、数量和粮质标准，双方共同遵守。河南睢县二区各乡农民为执行合同，自动成立缴粮大队和公粮检验组，实行“三晒、三筛、三检”，保证粮质“干、净、饱满”。山东省征收的粮食，水分一般不超过百分之十二点五，杂质不超过百分之零点五。河南许昌县黄庄乡把送粮车辆都编了号，依次排列，顺次入库，秩序井然。平原、河北等省实行征雇运输办法，运粮效率较前提高三点二五倍。
    为了严密征收手续，华东、中南部分地区采用了集中到县、区编册造串（三联单）的办法。山东莱阳县由县府集中编造公粮册据，结果错串率由去年的百分之二·○九降低到万分之五强，提高造册、填串效率四·四倍。
    今年夏征工作中，个别地区仍然发生了违反政策的情形。有些干部错误地提出“全年依率计征，夏季任务包干”的办法，发生了“夏重秋轻”或“夏轻秋重”的偏向。个别县区夏季产量占全年产量百分之三十四，而夏征税额却达全年税额百分之七十。有的地区逐级分配减免任务，发生了平均减免及应减未减的现象。此外，个别地区不遵守“交接合同”，没有按时、按秩序、按指定路线缴粮，以致发生了人畜伤亡事件。这是在今后征收农业税时应该力加纠正的。
