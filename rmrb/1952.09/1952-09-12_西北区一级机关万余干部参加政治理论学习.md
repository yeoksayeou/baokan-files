Over ten thousand cadres from the first-level organs in the Northwest District began political theory studies in early and mid-July. According to incomplete statistics, a total of over ten thousand cadres from the first-level organs in the Northwest District are currently participating in political theory studies, with a total of 208 assistant instructors and 127 theoretical teachers selected and appointed.

In the past two months, apart from the advanced groups studying "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (currently studying "On Practice" and "On Contradiction") at varying paces, the majority of intermediate groups have entered the second unit (the Second Revolutionary Civil War period) of the "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," and most of the elementary groups have completed the first chapter of the "Reader of Political Common Sense."

This study is being conducted on the basis of the great victory of the "Three-Anti" movement, after a series of ideological constructions such as democratic supplementary lessons and ideological criticism, and under the circumstances that the majority of cadres have raised their class consciousness and leaders at all levels generally attach importance to cadre education. Therefore, at the beginning of this study, many organs established and improved the organ study committee and prepared for study grading, selecting and appointing assistant instructors and theoretical teachers, and formulating specific study plans. Most organs also held study mobilization meetings, repeatedly explaining the necessity and possibility of strengthening systematic theoretical study and trying out a regular schooling system, criticizing the erroneous idea of ​​underestimating study, and correcting cadres' study attitudes. For example, leading comrades of the Northwest Women's Federation personally urged the formulation of study plans, made study mobilization reports based on the actual situation of their own organs, and used methods such as oral examinations and attendance checks to conduct timely criticisms and commendations, thereby greatly encouraging the cadres' enthusiasm for study. In addition, some larger units, such as the Cadre Education and Management Office of the Northwest Cultural and Educational Committee, provided a lot of help to assistant instructors and theoretical teachers, and played the role of assistant instructors and theoretical teachers. Many unit instructors can often participate in the study discussion meetings of the intermediate groups, make inspiring speeches in a timely manner, and introduce necessary reference materials, thereby promoting the study. Some organs also pay more attention to the study of the elementary groups. For example, the Xi'an Railway Branch established an spare time political school, with the heads of the organs serving as the president and vice presidents, and the director and vice directors of studies, and personally giving lectures. At the same time, capable cadres were also selected to serve as class teachers and teachers. Therefore, the study enthusiasm of all cadres is generally high. The study of the advanced groups has generally been carried out in a planned and led manner. All of these show that theoretical study has already made certain achievements and created conditions for further in-depth study in the future.

However, judging from the current overall study situation, there are still many shortcomings. Responsible comrades and comrades directly participating in the leadership of the study in many units still lack sufficient understanding of the importance of strengthening the theoretical study of on-the-job cadres, and are indifferent to the leadership of the study, pushing all leadership responsibilities to the secretary of the study committee. Individual leading comrades in some units even put work and study in opposition to each other, using the excuse of being busy with work to abandon the leadership of the study and failing to guarantee the cadres' study time. In addition, there are still some organ study committees that have not seriously taken on the responsibility of leading the study. Many unit assistant instructors emphasize being busy with work and have not yet started tutoring work, making study tutoring a mere formality. Secondly, some cadres regard study grading as a political treatment, mistakenly believing that participating in the elementary group hurts their "face," thus affecting their study enthusiasm or work enthusiasm. For example, individual comrades in the Northwest Public Security Department originally wanted to participate in the intermediate group, but signed up to participate in the elementary group. After the leadership agreed, he complained and grumbled, and was very dissatisfied. Some organs have criticized and corrected this wrong attitude, but individual administrative responsible comrades or study leading comrades in other units have accommodated this backward thinking, inappropriately emphasizing taking care of the cadres' emotions, lowering the standards of grading, and putting many people who should have been in the elementary group into the intermediate group, and putting some cadres with very low education levels and general odd-job workers into the elementary group. Again, in terms of learning attitude and learning methods, there is a more general shortcoming of "aiming too high" and "biting off more than one can chew." For example, some comrades did not study the main documents well, but skimmed through a lot of reference books; or they did not grasp the spirit and essence of the documents, and discussed and studied issues in a vacuum. At the same time, many comrades still lack a systematic understanding of the history of the Party, and are busy studying specialized issues such as Party building, united front, armed struggle, rural base areas, peasant issues, and land issues; or they leave the documents to talk emptily about their right-leaning thoughts in the "Three-Anti" movement or their "left" leaning emotions when participating in land reform; still others lack sufficient understanding of the need for long-term systematic theoretical study, are unwilling to work hard, are eager to achieve quick results, and think that simply attending classes, listening to reports, and participating in discussion meetings can improve their political and theoretical level; they feel that studying diligently according to the plan "does not solve the problem" and "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst," so their study enthusiasm is unstable. Therefore, the administrative leadership and study committees of various organs must attach importance to specific leadership, correct various erroneous attitudes of cadres towards theoretical study, so that the study can go a step further.

### 西北区一级机关万余干部参加政治理论学习

    西北区一级机关万余干部参加政治理论学习
    西北区一级机关绝大多数单位的在职干部都于七月初旬和中旬开始了政治理论学习。据不完全的统计：西北区一级机关目前参加政治理论学习的干部共有一万余人，共选聘辅导员二百零八人，理论教员一百二十七人。
    近两个月以来，除高级组自学“毛泽东选集”（目前学习“实践论”和“矛盾论”）的进度各有不同外，绝大多数的中级组都已进入“中国共产党的三十年”第二单元（第二次国内革命战争时期）的学习阶段，多数初级组也已经学完“政治常识读本”第一章。
    这次学习是在伟大的“三反”运动胜利的基础上，经过民主补课和思想批判等一系列的思想建设之后，在多数干部提高了阶级觉悟，各级领导普遍重视干部教育的情况下进行的。所以，在这次学习的初期，许多机关即建立和健全了机关学习委员会，做好了学习编级、选聘辅导员和理论教员、制订具体学习计划等项准备工作。多数机关并召开了学习动员大会，反复地说明了加强系统的理论学习、试行正规学制的必要性和可能性，批判了轻视学习的错误思想，端正了干部的学习态度。如西北妇联行政负责同志亲自督促制订学习计划，针对本机关的实际情况作了学习动员报告，并采用口试、考勤等办法及时地进行了批评和表扬，从而大大鼓舞了干部的学习热情。另外，一些比较大的单位，如西北文教委员会机关干部教育管理处等，对辅导员和理论教员进行了许多帮助，发挥了辅导员和理论教员的作用。许多单位的辅导员都能经常参加中级组的学习讨论会，及时作启发性的发言，并介绍必要的参考材料，因而推动了学习。有些机关对初级组的学习也比较重视。如西安铁路分局成立了业余政治学校，由机关首长分任正、副校长和正、副教务主任，并亲自讲课；同时，还抽调了得力干部担任班主任和教员，因而全体干部的学习情绪一般都是高涨的。高级组的学习一般也做到了有计划有领导的进行。所有这些，都说明理论学习已经有了一定的成绩，并为今后的深入学习创造了条件。
    但从目前整个的学习情况来看还有不少缺点。不少单位的负责同志和直接参加学习领导的同志，对于加强在职干部理论学习的重要性还缺乏足够的认识，对学习领导漠不关心，把全部领导责任推给了学习委员会秘书。个别单位的某些领导同志甚至把工作和学习对立起来，藉口工作忙放弃了对学习的领导，对干部的学习时间也不加以保证。另外，也还有一些机关的学习委员会，没有认真负起领导学习的责任。不少单位的辅导员强调工作忙，至今还没有开始辅导工作，使学习辅导流于形式。其次，部分干部把学习编级看成了政治待遇，错误地认为参加初级组有伤自己的“面子”，因而学习情绪或工作情绪受了影响。如西北公安部的个别同志，本想参加中级组，但报名参加初级组，经领导方面同意后，他又讲怪话、发牢骚，很不满意。有些机关对这种错误态度进行了批评和纠正，但也有个别单位的行政负责同志或学习领导同志却迁就了这种落后思想，不适当地强调了照顾干部的情绪，降低了编级的标准，把许多本来应该编入初级组的人编入了中级组，把一些文化程度很低，本来需要学习文化的干部和一般勤杂人员都编入了初级组。再次，在学习态度和学习方法上，比较普遍地存在着“好高鹜远”“贪多嚼不烂”的缺点。例如，有些同志对主要文件没有好好钻研，却走马观花地翻了好多参考书；或者不去掌握文件的精神和实质，空洞地来讨论和研究问题。同时不少同志对党史还缺乏系统的了解，就忙着去钻研党的建设、统一战线、武装斗争、农村根据地、农民问题和土地问题等专门性的问题；或离开文件去空谈自己在“三反”运动中的右倾思想或参加土地改革时的“左”倾情绪；还有些同志对必须进行长期的系统的理论学习缺乏足够的认识，不愿下苦功夫，急于求成，以为单是上课、听报告、参加讨论会就可以提高自己的政治理论水平；觉得按照计划、认真读书“不解决问题”、“远水解不了近渴”，因而学习情绪不稳。所以，目前各机关行政领导方面和学习委员会，必须重视具体领导，纠正干部对待理论学习的各种错误态度，使学习能够深入一步。
