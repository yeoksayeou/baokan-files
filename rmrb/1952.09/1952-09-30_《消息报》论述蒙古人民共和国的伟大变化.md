(TASS Moscow Dispatch) The 《Izvestia》 published an article by Gong Kulov on the 23rd, describing the great changes that have taken place in the Mongolian People's Republic since the revolution. The author pointed out: The number of livestock in the Mongolian People's Republic has doubled. The backward nomadic method that could not cope with natural disasters no longer exists. Mongolia has implemented rational methods of large-scale livestock breeding. Preliminary collective labor organizations, the herding production associations, are growing and strengthening. State-owned farms with first-class mechanical equipment, machine and mowing stations, veterinary and animal breeding stations are developing.

Moreover, Mongolia's achievements are not only reflected in animal husbandry. Various factories have been established, and the production of coal and other minerals is expanding. New railways have been built. The country is proud to have a cadre of workers, engineers, and technicians all over the country.

Mongolia has become a country without illiteracy. The republic has a national university, a normal college, a senior party school, and a night university for studying Marxism-Leninism. There are now 27 kinds of newspapers and 16 kinds of magazines; part of the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as well as many works of Russian classical writers and Soviet writers, have been translated into Mongolian and published. Writers, painters, composers, sculptors, architects, and actors are engaged in creative labor.

The author introduced the situation of Choibalsan City, named after Marshal Choibalsan, saying: Industrial buildings, residential areas, cultural and public facilities, closely connected yurts (Mongolian yurts), the exceptionally vigorous spirit of the people, the coming and going of cars, and the roar of mining machinery have all changed people's long-held impression of the silent Mongolian grasslands. Nature itself is also being changed. The blue surface of a man-made lake complements the deep valleys and peaks on the grassland.

Not far from the lake, a vocational school that trains cadres for the national working class is training senior skilled workers. Mongolian youths are studying very hard in order to acquire technical knowledge, become the vanguard of the working class, and become mine foremen, technicians, and engineers in the future. This is the way the best representatives of the new Mongolian young working class live and work.

There are many more people working in the rapidly developing industrial sectors, including: coal mines and other mining industries, railway transportation departments, the Marshal Choibalsan Factory in Ulaanbaatar, power stations, meat packaging factories, cream manufacturing plants, state-owned farms, and repair factories.

The country is changing, and the fate of the hardworking Mongolian people is also changing.

The eternal friendship and unbreakable alliance with the great Soviet Union, and the selfless assistance and care of the Soviet people and Stalin himself, have created favorable conditions for Mongolia, which was once one of the most backward dependencies in the East, to move towards prosperity. Today, Mongolia is victoriously marching towards socialism and a glorious future.

    《消息报》论述蒙古人民共和国的伟大变化
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《消息报》二十三日刊载龚古洛夫所作的一篇文章，叙述蒙古人民共和国从革命以来发生的伟大变化。作者指出：蒙古人民共和国的牲畜头数已经增加了一倍。无力应付天灾的落后游牧方式已经不复存在了。蒙古已实行合理的大量饲养牲畜的方法。初步的集体劳动组织牧民生产协会，正在日益发展和壮大。拥有头等机械装备的国营农场，机器与割草站、兽医与动物饲养站，都在发展。
    而且，蒙古的成就不仅表现在畜牧业这一方面。各种工厂已经建立起来，煤与其他矿物的生产正在扩展着。新的铁路已经修成。这个国家因全国各地有着工人、工程师与技师干部而感到自豪。
    蒙古已经成为一个没有文盲的国家。这个共和国内有一所国立大学，一所师范学院，一所高级党校，一所学习马克思—列宁主义的夜间大学。现在有报纸二十七种，杂志十六种；马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的一部分著作以及许多俄国古典作家与苏联作家的作品已译成蒙古文出版。作家、画家、作曲家、雕刻家、建筑家与演员们都在从事创造性的劳动。
    作者介绍以乔巴山元帅的名字命名的乔巴山城的情况说：工业建筑、住宅区、文化与公用设备、密迩相连的约塔（蒙古包）、人民的异常蓬勃的朝气、来来往往的汽车、开矿机器的轰鸣，这一切都改变了人们一向所有的静寂的蒙古草原的印象。自然本身也正在被改变着。一个人造湖的蔚蓝的湖面与草原上的深谷与山峰相辉映。
    在离这个湖不远的地方，一所训练全国工人阶级干部的职业学校正在训练高级技术工人。蒙古青年都在非常努力地学习，以便获得技术知识，成为工人阶级的前锋，在将来成为矿业领班、技师与工程师。这就是新蒙古年轻的工人阶级的最优秀代表们生活和工作的情形。
    还有许多人是在迅速发展的各个工业部门里工作，这些工业部门包括：煤矿与其他矿业、铁路运输部门、乌兰巴托的乔巴山元帅工厂、动力站、肉类包装工厂、奶油制造厂、国营农场和修理工厂。
    这个国家正在改变着，勤劳的蒙古人民的命运也正在改变着。
    与伟大的苏联之间的永恒友谊和牢不可破的联盟，苏联人民和斯大林本人的无私的援助与关怀，已替曾经一度是东方最落后的附属国之一的蒙古，造成了走向繁荣的有利条件。今天的蒙古正在向社会主义、向辉煌的前途，胜利地迈进。
