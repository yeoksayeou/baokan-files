    Technical Workers Should Be Used Rationally

    Comrade Editor: After reading the People's Daily editorial published on June 14th, "Put Specialized Technical Talents in the Most Needed Positions for Economic Construction," I was reminded of some things at the East Factory of the Shenyang Machinery Plant No. 12. I believe that the leading cadres in this factory have not yet fully realized the great significance of rationally using specialized technical talents. For example, Chen Gexin, a young worker in the factory, was promoted to technical worker this April. Before that, he spent a year and a half studying his profession. He has a high level of enthusiasm for his work. In formulating the production increase and conservation plan, the master workers repairing valve cores set a target of 310 pieces per person per shift. However, Chen Gexin created a new record of 410 pieces. Based on this situation, the leadership should have summarized his advanced experience and promoted it throughout the factory. The opposite is true. Not only did they not summarize his advanced experience, but they unilaterally emphasized "work needs" and transferred him to work as a material clerk. I think this is a great loss to production. Since the leadership has cultivated him for more than a year, they should help him to further his studies based on his existing technical level, improve his political level, and gradually make him a technician or engineer for the construction of the motherland. I think this is definitely more suitable than working as a material clerk, and more beneficial to production.

    For example, Wang Xueqing and Yu Yongtai, activists in the factory, are both experts in sand casting. In principle, they should be promoted to team leader or workshop director. However, the leadership allowed Wang Xueqing to become the head of the general affairs section and Yu Yongtai to become the head of the transportation section.

    I believe that assigning specialized technical personnel to non-specialized technical work is extremely harmful to the country's construction. Therefore, I suggest that the leaders of the factory should make appropriate adjustments to this issue, so as to ensure that specialized talents are used for specialized purposes.

    应合理地使用技术工人
    编辑同志：当我看到人民日报六月十四日发表的“把专门技术人材放到经济建设最需要的岗位上去”的社论以后，我联想起沈阳机械十二厂东厂的一些事情，我认为这个厂里的领导干部到目前为止，还没有很好地认识到合理使用专门技术人材的重大意义。例如，厂里的青年工人陈革新，是今年四月被提升为技术工人的，在这以前他花了一年半的时间去学习业务。他的工作热情很高，在订增产节约计划中，老师傅车补心外皮，每班每人订三百一十件，但陈革新却创造了四百一十件的新纪录。根据这种情况，领导方面本应总结他的先进经验，再推广到全厂。事实恰恰相反，不但没有总结他的先进经验，反而片面地强调“工作需要”把他调去作领料员的工作。我觉得这对生产是一个很大的损失，既然领导方面把他培养了一年多，就应当在他现有的技术水平上，帮助他再深造一步，提高他的政治水平，使他逐渐成为建设祖国的技师、工程师，我想这一定比做领料员工作更为合适，对生产上更有利。
    又如，该厂积极分子王学卿、于永泰都是翻砂的能手，按理应提升为班长、车间主任。可是领导方面却让王学卿做总务股长，于永泰做运输股长。
    我认为分配专门技术人员担任非专门技术的工作，这对国家建设事业是极端有害的。因此，我建议厂里的领导方面对这问题，应加以适当的调整，以便做到专材专用。  顾众
