New Achievements in Collective Welfare for Workers in State-Owned Factories and Mines in Northeast China

    Based on the development of production, the collective welfare undertakings of workers in state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have achieved new results.
    Last year, in addition to completing the state production plan, workers in state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China increased production and saved wealth equivalent to 16 million tons of grain for the country (equivalent to 101.6 trillion yuan in RMB). Each factory and mine therefore received substantial enterprise bonus funds. This year, in order to meet the needs of workers' welfare, various factories and mines used these enterprise bonus funds to build or expand workers' dormitories, canteens, bathhouses, clubs, libraries, nurseries, etc. In many larger state-owned factories and mines, sanatoriums, convalescent homes, kindergartens, and day care centers have also been established. The Shenyang Mechanical Workers' First Sanatorium, jointly organized by the Northeast People's Government Mechanical Industry Administration and the Shenyang Mechanical Manufacturing Trade Union, was completed in June this year and has already admitted the first group of workers with chronic diseases for recuperation. The Northeast People's Government has also decided to build seven chronic disease sanatoriums, one elderly and disabled home, and one comprehensive club for workers in Northeast China. One of the sanatoriums began construction in July this year at the confluence of the Hulan River and the Songhua River in the scenic southern suburbs of Hulan County, Songjiang Province. This sanatorium was designed with the help of Soviet experts, and is large in scale and well-equipped. After completion, it will become one of the most modern hospitals in China. In terms of improving workers' cultural and recreational life, many factories and mines have purchased film projectors in addition to equipping themselves with various musical instruments, balls, chess sets, etc., and screen movies for workers once or twice a week. The Longfeng Mine of the Fushun Mining Bureau is preparing to build a park for workers to visit. In this year's capital construction, great achievements have also been made in workers' collective welfare undertakings. Many construction sites are equipped with clean and bright workers' dormitories, as well as canteens, barbershops, bathhouses, and clinics; some construction sites also have cooperatives, libraries, broadcasting stations, and clubs.
    The collective welfare undertakings of workers in state-owned factories and mines have greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the vast number of workers. After the establishment of nurseries at the Northeast Rubber Factory No. 7, the female workers became very enthusiastic about production. Female worker Yin Guilan, no longer worrying about her children, improved her work efficiency by 62.5% in the production competition, and the product qualification rate also reached 99.9%. After the No. 3 Garment Factory improved worker welfare, the workers' enthusiasm for work became even higher. They conscientiously studied the advanced experience of Jiang Wanshou's continuous operation method and implemented the daily production plan, enabling the August production plan to be overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and the qualification rate of the products reached 99.88%.

    东北国营厂矿职工集体福利事业获新成绩
    在生产发展的基础上，东北国营工厂矿山职工的集体福利事业获得了新的成绩。
    东北国营工厂矿山的职工，去年除完成国家生产计划外，为国家增产节约了价值一千六百万吨粮食的财富（折合人民币十万一千六百亿元），每个工厂矿山都因此得到了大量的企业奖励基金。今年各工厂矿山为了满足职工福利事业的需要，就用这笔企业奖励基金修建或扩充了职工宿舍、食堂、澡塘、俱乐部、图书馆、托儿所等。在许多规模较大的国营工厂矿山中，还建立了疗养院、休养所、幼儿院和保育院。东北人民政府机械工业管理局和沈阳机械制造业工会共同举办的沈阳市机械工人第一疗养院已经在今年六月落成，并已收容了第一批患有慢性病的工人入院疗养。东北人民政府还决定给东北职工修建七个慢性病疗养所、一个养老残废院、一个综合性俱乐部。其中一个疗养所已于今年七月在风景幽美的松江省呼兰县南郊呼兰河和松花江合流处开始修建。这个疗养所是由苏联专家帮助设计的，规模很大，设备完善，建成后将成为我国目前最新型的病院之一。在改进职工文化娱乐生活方面，很多工厂矿山除设备了各种乐器、球类、棋类等外，还购买了电影放映机，每周给职工们放映电影一次到两次。抚顺矿务局龙凤矿准备修建一座公园，供职工们游览。在今年基本建设中，工人的集体福利事业也得到很大成绩。很多施工现场除设有整洁光亮的工人宿舍外，并设有食堂、理发室、澡塘、医务所；有的工地还设立了合作社、图书馆、广播站和俱乐部等。
    国营工厂矿山职工集体福利事业大大地激发了广大职工的劳动热情。东北橡胶七厂在建立托儿所以后，女工生产非常起劲。女工尹桂兰因不再牵挂孩子，在生产竞赛中工作效率提高了百分之六十二点五，产品合格率也达到了百分之九十九点九。被服三厂改善职工福利后，职工劳动热情更加高涨，认真学习了姜万寿连续操作法的先进经验，并贯彻了生产日计划，使八月份的生产计划提前超额完成，所出产品的合格率达到了百分之九十九点八八。（新华社）
