    On Some Labor and Employment Issues

    Q: China's intellectuals are fundamentally too few, not too many. Why is there still an unemployment phenomenon among intellectuals?

    A: From a basic perspective, intellectuals are indeed too few and cannot meet the needs of large-scale national construction. However, the current group of unemployed intellectuals exists because: (1) The vast majority of these unemployed intellectuals lack specialized knowledge and skills. Some are ideologically backward, and some have complex political and historical backgrounds. Therefore, some government agencies and enterprises have been hesitant to hire these people in the past; (2) Most of these unemployed intellectuals are middle-aged with many family burdens, and they also have more concerns about employment – they are generally unwilling to go to the countryside, and even more unwilling to work in remote areas. Some do face real difficulties if they work in other places, which adds to the difficulties of employment; (3) This group of unemployed intellectuals also includes a large number of housewives who are intellectuals. In the old society, some of these women could not find jobs due to social discrimination, and some were long-term dependents on their husbands due to parasitic thinking. Over the past three years since liberation, their social status has improved, and their thinking has also changed, so they are now seeking employment.

    In response to the above situation, to solve the problem of unemployed intellectuals, on the one hand, certain government agencies and enterprises must be required to dispel ideological concerns about hiring these unemployed intellectuals and try to use older people and women to replace young people in jobs that are suitable for older people and women; on the other hand, the unemployed intellectuals themselves must recognize their ideological shortcomings and weaknesses in ability, strive to transform and improve themselves to meet the urgent needs of large-scale national construction.

    Q: What is the People's Government's policy for solving the problem of unemployed intellectuals?

    A: The basic policy for solving the problem of unemployed intellectuals should be education, transformation, and utilization. The large-scale construction work that the country is about to begin requires a large number of intellectuals. To meet the needs of the country, the main task is of course to vigorously cultivate new intellectuals, but at the same time, we must also educate, transform, and utilize the old intellectuals. Otherwise, it would not only be a waste of a large force that the country can use, but also fail to meet the current needs of national construction. Therefore, unemployed intellectuals can be universally registered and trained in batches in a planned way. After education and transformation, they can be placed in certain jobs and continue to be educated and transformed in their work.

    Q: Can unemployed intellectuals with some historical issues be recommended for jobs?

    A: For people with some historical issues, as long as they honestly explain the issues clearly, the government can still adopt the policy of education, transformation, and utilization towards them.

    Q: How will the government handle elderly and frail intellectuals?

    A: For those who possess considerable knowledge and have considerable prestige in their localities, but are unable to take on arduous work due to old age and frailty, the government should take appropriate measures to absorb them into appropriate work and provide them with care. For general intellectuals who are old and weak, completely unable to work, and have genuine financial difficulties, the government should also provide appropriate relief.

    Q: What should be done if housewives who are intellectuals want to work but cannot get rid of household chores?

    A: For housewives who are intellectuals who want to work, special consideration should be given to their difficulties in dealing with household affairs. Appropriate measures can be taken gradually, in an organized and planned manner, to absorb them into work. For example, they can work half a day or a few hours and be given a certain living allowance. This is beneficial to both them and the country.

    Q: How should the surplus labor force in rural areas be resolved?

    A: The surplus labor force in rural areas is different from the unemployed and semi-unemployed people in cities because they have food to eat and land to cultivate. However, the government should actively find ways to enable these large numbers of potential labor forces to play their role in production.

    At present, we must first find ways for these labor forces in rural areas: We must plan and step by step migrate to the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions; carry out land reclamation and expand the cultivated area without destroying soil and water conservation and hindering livestock development; build water conservancy projects, improve soil, and cultivate intensively to increase the yield per unit area; plan to develop marketable side businesses and handicrafts, and carry out the initial processing of local products; promote afforestation, fish farming and fishing, and various rural constructions, so that these potential labor forces can be fully utilized.

    Secondly, it must also be pointed out that due to the insufficient cultivated land in our country, coupled with the gradual development of collectivization, mechanization, and scientification in agricultural production, more surplus labor will inevitably be generated in the future. Although the surplus labor force in rural areas is an important source of labor reserve for large-scale economic construction in the future, it must be organized and trained in a planned and step-by-step manner with the development of cities and industries and the development of all aspects of the country to meet the needs of industry. Therefore, county and district cadres should be educated to persuade farmers not to blindly flow into cities.

    Q: How will the People's Government handle the unemployment problem of former military officers and former officials?

    A: For former military officers and former officials who express their allegiance to the people and are willing to atone for their crimes, if they currently have no legitimate occupation and have genuine financial difficulties, the People's Government adopts the policy of education, transformation, and utilization towards them. The government allows them to register for employment and undergo training and transformation in batches and phases in a planned way, to help them change careers, and to continue to transform themselves in labor and work.

    Q: Can former military officers and former officials with political and historical issues apply for registration?

    A: It should be handled differently according to the specific circumstances. For those whose political and historical problems are not significant and who have sincerely confessed, the policy of education, transformation, and utilization should still be adopted. A small number of senior former military officers and former officials who are unable to participate in training and change careers, and who have genuine financial difficulties, should also be given appropriate care in handling if they have no significant bad deeds in the past and are not unpopular.

专栏：答读者问

    关于劳动就业中的一些问题
    问：中国的知识分子基本上是太少，而不是太多，为什么现在还存在着知识分子失业的现象？
    答：从基本情况来看，知识分子的确是太少，不能适应国家大规模建设的需要。但目前社会上所存在着的一批失业知识分子，是因为：（一）这批失业知识分子中绝大部分是没有专门学识和技能的，有些人思想还很落后，也有些人政治历史情况确实比较复杂，因此过去某些机关和企业单位对吸收这些人参加工作有顾虑；（二）这批失业知识分子中大部分是中年人，家庭拖累较多，在就业思想上的顾虑也较多——他们一般的不愿意到农村，更不愿意到边远地区工作，有些人如果到外地工作，家庭也确有困难，这也就增加了就业的困难条件；（三）这批失业知识分子中，还包括了很大一部分家庭知识妇女。这些妇女在过去的旧社会里，有的因为受到社会歧视而找不到职业，有的因为存在着依靠丈夫的寄生思想，长期处在家庭生活中；解放三年来，她们的社会地位提高了，思想也有了变化，所以也就要求就业了。
    针对以上情况，为解决失业知识分子的问题，一方面，必须要求某些机关企业打破对吸收这些失业知识分子参加工作的思想顾虑，并尽量用老年人和妇女接替现在由年青人所担任的而适合于老年和妇女担任的工作；另方面，失业知识分子本身则必须认识自己思想上的缺点和能力上的弱点，努力改造并提高自己，以适应国家大规模建设的迫切需要。问：人民政府解决失业知识分子问题的方针是什么？
    答：解决失业知识分子问题的基本方针，应该是教育改造和使用。国家即将开始的大规模的建设工作需要大批知识分子，为了满足国家的需要，主要的当然是大力培养新的知识分子，但同时还必须对旧的知识分子加以教育、改造和使用。否则不仅浪费了国家一大批可以用的力量，而且也不能适应目前国家建设的需要。因此，失业知识分子可以普遍登记，有步骤地分批训练，经过教育和改造，就可以把他们放在一定的工作岗位上使用，在工作中继续教育和改造他们。
    问：历史上有些问题的失业知识分子是不是可以介绍职业？
    答：历史上多少有些问题的人，只要他们忠诚老实地把问题交代清楚，政府对他们仍可采取教育、改造、使用的方针。
    问：对年老体弱的知识分子将怎样处理？
    答：对具有相当学识且在地方上有相当声望，但因年老体弱，不能担任辛劳工作者，政府应采取适当办法，吸收他们参加适当工作，并予以照顾。对于一般年老力衰，完全失去工作能力而生活确实困难的失业知识分子，政府亦应给予适当的救济。
    问：家庭知识妇女要求参加工作，但又无法摆脱家务，怎么办？
    答：对要求参加工作的家庭知识妇女，应特别照顾她们有家庭事务拖累的困难，可以逐步地有组织有计划地采取适当的办法，吸收她们参加工作。比如：她们可以工作半日或几小时，而给予一定的生活补助费。这样做，对她们和国家都是有好处的。
    问：农村中的剩余劳动力应该怎样解决？
    答：农村中的剩余劳动力不同于城市中失业半失业人员，因为他们是有饭吃有地种的人。不过，政府应该积极设法使这些大量潜在的劳动力在生产上发挥其作用。
    在目前，首先应该在农村中为这些劳动力寻找出路：必须有计划有步骤地向东北、西北和西南地区移民；在不破坏水土保持及不妨害牧畜发展的条件下，进行垦荒，扩大耕地面积；兴修水利、改良土壤、精耕细作以提高单位面积产量；有计划地发展有销路的副业与手工业，进行土产的初步加工；提倡植树造林、养鱼捕鱼和各种农村建设，使这些潜在的劳动力得以充分发挥。
    其次，还必须指出，由于我国已耕土地不足，再加上农业生产中逐步发展着的集体化、机械化和科学化，今后一定会产生更多的剩余劳动力。农村剩余劳动力虽然是今后大规模经济建设的劳动后备军的重要来源；但必须随着城市与工业的发展，国家各方面建设的发展，有计划有步骤地组织训练，以供应工业的需要。因此，应该教育县区干部说服农民，不要盲目地向城市流动。
    问：人民政府对旧军官、旧官吏的失业问题将怎样处理？
    答：凡表示向人民靠拢，愿意立功赎罪的旧军官、旧官吏，如现在尚无正当职业，生活确实困难者，人民政府对他们是采取教育、改造、使用的方针。政府允许他们进行劳动就业登记，有计划地分期分批予以训练、改造，帮助他们转业，使他们在劳动、工作中继续改造。
    问：有政治历史问题的旧军官、旧官吏，是否可以申请登记？
    答：应根据具体情况分别处理。凡政治历史问题不大且已真诚交代者，仍应采取教育、改造、使用的方针。少数高级旧军官、旧官吏，无法参加训练转业，而生活确实困难者，如过去没有显著劣迹、民愤不大，在处理时亦应适当予以照顾。
