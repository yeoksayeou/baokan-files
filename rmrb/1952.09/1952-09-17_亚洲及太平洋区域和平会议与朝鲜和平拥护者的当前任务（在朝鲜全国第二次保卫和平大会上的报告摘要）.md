    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the Current Tasks of Korean Peace Supporters
    (Summary of Report at the Second National Conference for the Defense of Peace in Korea)
    Han Xueye, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace
    This conference is convened by the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace to welcome the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, closely cooperate with the worldwide movement to defend peace, and especially to coordinate efforts in the struggle for peace in Asia.
    The tense international situation that the American and British imperialists have been striving to create and maintain places the people of the world once again in the face of the threat of war. This situation makes it necessary and possible for us to unite all forces and guide the development of the current international situation towards the path of guaranteeing peace.
    Today, the people of the East have formed a powerful陣容 (zhenrong - lineup, contingent) in the movement to defend peace. In this 陣容 (zhenrong - lineup, contingent), stands the heroic Korean people, victoriously advancing in the anti-aggression war, and the peace fortress of the East - the great 500 million Chinese people. The great Chinese people, in the Korean War, sent their volunteer army to aid the Korean people, demonstrating the lofty spirit of internationalism and a new example of international unity. In addition, in this 陣容 (zhenrong - lineup, contingent) are the Vietnamese people who have liberated more than 90% of their territory in the long war against imperialist aggression, the Japanese people who have risen up against the colonial slavery imposed by the US military occupation, and the people of other countries who are fighting for their national independence. The people of these countries are launching national liberation movements to end the oppression, exploitation, and occupation by imperialist aggressors, and this movement is continuing to grow despite the intensified suppression by the imperialists. The struggle of the Asian people against the American and British imperialist warmongers and for freedom, independence, and democracy is a struggle for the peace and security of the whole world, and especially for the peace and security of Asia.
    Today, the era when imperialists could threaten and plunder weak nations with warships, cannons, tanks, and airplanes is gone forever. The Soviet Union liberated the Korean people from the shackles of Japanese imperialism. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, drove the aggressive forces of American and British imperialism out of their territory. The collapse of Japanese imperialism and the creation of the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea mark a epoch-making dawn for Asia.
    Regarding the Korean people's three-year anti-aggression war, the Korean people clearly understand that if the Korean people had failed to inflict heavy blows on the enemy in the battle against the American and British imperialist aggressors, then the disasters suffered by the Korean people would inevitably have been deepened, and the dangers faced by our neighbors and the people of all countries in the world would inevitably have been even more serious. It is precisely because of this that the heroic Korean people have received the brotherly support and solidarity of the people of the world in the Fatherland Liberation War. The enormous assistance and the spirit of internationalism demonstrated by the people of the great Soviet Union, China, and the various People's Democratic countries have further strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory.
    General Kim Il Sung said in his report commemorating the 7th anniversary of the liberation of Korea on "August 15" this year: "Now the Korean people are not only defending the independence, freedom, and the people's democratic system and republic that the Korean people have already established from the aggression of the American and British armed interventionists, but also defending the peace and security of the whole world. The Korean people are using their heroic struggle to stop the American and British armed interventionists from madly launching a third world war." Today, the Korean people's struggle to defend peace is inevitably linked to the struggle to win freedom and independence for the fatherland in a war environment. Therefore, the task of defending the fatherland has become the primary task of the Korean people.
    I call on all attendees to immediately elect a Korean delegation to attend the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in Beijing, and call on all attendees and all Korean people to fully recognize the great significance of convening the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, and to do their utmost to support this conference as a major step in effectively safeguarding peace and security in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will unite 1.6 billion people to fight against the American beasts' heinous atrocities in Korea and against the American and British aggressors' acts of intervention and aggression in the Asian and Pacific regions. We are confident that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will make a great contribution to the world peace movement.

    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议与朝鲜和平拥护者的当前任务
    （在朝鲜全国第二次保卫和平大会上的报告摘要）
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会委员长  韩雪野
    这次大会是朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会为了迎接即将举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，密切配合全世界的保卫和平运动，特别是配合争取亚洲和平的斗争而召开的。
    美英帝国主义所竭力造成和保持的紧张的国际局势，使全世界人民今天重又面临着战争的威胁。这种情况使我们必须而且可能团结一切力量，把目前国际局势的发展方向导向保障和平的道路。
    今天东方人民在保卫和平的运动中业已构成强大的阵营。在这个阵营中，屹立着正在反侵略战争中胜利前进的英雄的朝鲜人民，和东方的和平堡垒——伟大的五万万中国人民。伟大的中国人民在朝鲜战争中派遣自己的志愿军援助朝鲜人民，显示了崇高的国际主义精神与国际团结的新的榜样。此外，在这个阵营中还有着在反抗帝国主义侵略的长期战争中业已解放了百分之九十以上的国土的越南人民，奋起反对由于美军的强占而陷于殖民地奴隶地位的日本人民以及正在为自己的民族独立而斗争的其他各国人民。这些国家的人民为了争取结束帝国主义侵略者的压迫、榨取和强占，正在展开着民族解放运动，这个运动不顾帝国主义者的加紧镇压正在继续壮大着。亚洲人民为反对美英帝国主义战争贩子与争取自由、独立、民主而进行的斗争，就是为了全世界和平安全，特别是为了亚洲和平安全的斗争。
    今天，帝国主义使用军舰大炮坦克飞机就可以威胁和掠夺弱小民族的时代已经一去不复返了。苏联从日本帝国主义的羁绊中解放了朝鲜人民。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下从自己的领土上驱逐了美英帝国主义侵略势力。日本帝国主义的崩溃，中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的创建，标志着划时代的亚洲的黎明。
    关于朝鲜人民三年来的反侵略战争，朝鲜人民清楚地知道，如果朝鲜人民在与美英帝国主义侵略军的战斗中未能给予敌人以沉重的打击，那么朝鲜人民所遭到的灾难必然更加深重，而且我们的邻邦和全世界各国人民所面临的危险也必然更加严重。也正是因为如此，英雄的朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中受到了全世界人民的兄弟般的支持和声援。伟大的苏联、中国及各人民民主国家人民所给予的巨大的援助和所表现的国际主义精神，更加坚定了朝鲜人民的胜利信心。
    金日成将军在今年“八·一五”朝鲜解放七周年纪念报告中说：“现在朝鲜人民不仅是在从美英武装干涉者的侵略中保卫着祖国的独立、自由和朝鲜人民所业已建立起来的人民民主制度与共和国，而且是在保卫着全世界的和平与安全。朝鲜人民正在以自己的英雄斗争阻止着美英武装干涉者疯狂地发动第三次世界大战。”今天朝鲜人民保卫和平的斗争，在战争环境中，必然地要与争取祖国自由、独立的斗争结合在一起。因此，保卫祖国的任务就成为朝鲜人民的首要任务了。
    我号召全体与会者立即选举前往北京参加即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的朝鲜代表团，并号召全体与会者和全朝鲜人民充分认识召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的重大意义，并以实际行动尽全力支持这个作为有效地保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平与安全的重大步骤的会议。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将把十六亿人民团结起来为制止美国野兽在朝鲜的罪恶暴行和反对美英侵略者在亚洲及太平洋区域的干涉与侵略行为而斗争。我们确信，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议必将对世界和平运动有巨大的贡献。（新华社）
