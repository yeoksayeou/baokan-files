    Irrefutable Evidence
    -- A Tour of the Exhibition on the U.S. Government's Germ Warfare Crimes

    The Exhibition on the U.S. Government's Germ Warfare Crimes is held in the Wenhua Hall of the Palace Museum in Beijing. The five exhibition rooms display the historical facts, testimonies, material evidence, and on-the-spot investigation reports by impartial Chinese and foreign individuals regarding the U.S.'s preparation for and conduct of germ warfare. These historical facts, testimonies, and material evidence are accompanied by explanations in Chinese, Russian, English, and French. The exhibition uses conclusive facts and scientific conclusions to prove the U.S. government's crimes of conducting germ warfare to the people of the world.

Historical Facts

    In the first exhibition room, photos, newspapers, and documents proving the U.S. government's decade-long preparation for germ warfare are displayed. Milke, former Chairman of the Biological Warfare Committee of the Chemical Warfare Service of the U.S. Department of the Army, stated in a report to Secretary of the Army Patterson on January 4, 1946, that the U.S. government began establishing specialized agencies to research and manufacture germ weapons in 1941. The central agency for manufacturing germ weapons was the Detrick Camp under the Chemical Warfare Service of the U.S. Department of the Army. The U.S. "Life" magazine on October 8, 1951, listed sixteen types of germ weapons. Rosebury, former director of the Airborne Infection Department of the U.S. Detrick Camp germ factory, admitted in his book "Peace or Pestilence" published in 1949 that many laboratory staff at Detrick Camp contracted diseases such as undulant fever, tularemia, psittacosis, and anthrax from the aforementioned sixteen types of germ weapons while manufacturing them. The exhibits prove that the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force all frantically prepared for germ warfare. The exhibits also prove that American imperialism has gathered Japanese germ warfare criminals Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, and German Nazi germ warfare criminal Schreiber, preparing to conduct germ warfare.

    After the U.S. launched germ warfare in Korea and China this January, the U.S. reactionaries carried out arrogant propaganda. Cleese, Director of Research and Development of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, said in Washington on January 25 this year: "Germs, poison gas, and radioactive materials may prove to be the cheapest weapons to conquer the enemy." The "U.S. News & World Report" published on March 21 even arrogantly stated: "There is no international law prohibiting germ weapons!" To the left of this sentence is exhibited the Geneva Protocol of June 17, 1925, which prohibits the use of asphyxiating, poisonous, or other gases, as well as bacteriological methods of warfare.

Irrefutable Iron Evidence

    The second exhibition room displays the statements of protest against the U.S. government's germ warfare by Korean Foreign Minister Park Hon-yong and Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, photos of the "Investigation Team of the U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" conducting on-the-spot investigations in Korea and Northeast China, photos of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers investigation team, photos of the International Scientific Commission for Investigating the Facts of Germ Warfare in Korea and China, photos of U.S. Air Force personnel Kenneth L. Enoch and John Quinn, who were captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers and confessed to dropping germ bombs, as well as enlarged photos of the full text of their confessions in English, photos and confessions of U.S. prisoner Marvin Brown, who confessed to proving that the U.S. conducted germ warfare on the Korean front, and photos and confessions of airborne spies Wang Qi, Tang Jusheng, Li Xingshun, Tan Zemin, and Zhang Guitang, sent by the U.S. military to gather intelligence on the effects of germ warfare.

    In the third exhibition room, the walls are covered with specimens of insects and other objects dropped by U.S. aircraft, along with explanations, enlarged photographs, insect or bacteriological identification reports, and photographs of experts examining and inspecting the items. In the glass cabinets in the room are arranged many microscopes, through which the morphology of various insects and bacteria can be seen. This exhibition room also displays part of the containers used by the U.S. military to spread insects and other objects:

    One type is the four-compartment germ bomb. This type of germ bomb was found most frequently. There are ten on display in the exhibition, each with a description stating the time and location it was dropped by a U.S. aircraft, as well as the densely packed condition of insects that suddenly appeared after the bomb landed, according to witnesses. This type of germ bomb is 137 cm long and 36.4 cm in diameter. The shell is made of two steel plates, 0.15 cm thick, and is divided into four compartments. The U.S. aggressors once argued that this was just a "propaganda bomb." However, on April 5 this year, the Associated Press reported that U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Sykes, after hearing a secret testimony from U.S. Chemical Corps Commander Bullene, publicly told the press: "He (referring to Bullene) said that the tools for spreading germs in enemy territory are simple, and the troops now have sufficient storage of this equipment... such as the containers currently used to drop propaganda leaflets." This report is displayed near the bomb.

    The second type is a paper tube-shaped germ container with a parachute. There are two types of similar designs. One of them on display was dropped by a U.S. aircraft in Goksan County, Geoltji-ri, Korea on February 29. When found, the lid had come off, and the parachute had English markings such as USC. It contained insects such as black flies and midges, as well as spiders. The bomb is 36 cm long and 13 cm in diameter. The top of the bomb is tied to a parachute made of rayon, and the bottom is equipped with a timing fuse. After a certain amount of time, the bottom of the tube falls off, and the insects scatter.

    The third type is the chalky germ bomb. The shell of the bomb is made of chalk, coated with aluminum paint. There is an iron shaft in the bomb, 28 cm long, with a steel plate connected to one end. The shell is very brittle and completely shattered upon landing. Many flies, spiders, and feathers were found at the landing site. According to physics experts, the shape of the bomb is a semi-spherical cylinder at one end.

        "We have obtained sufficient scientific evidence proving that U.S. imperialism is indeed using germ weapons in Korea and our country, which is irrefutable!" This is the solemn statement jointly issued at the exhibition by 54 Chinese experts in entomology, microbiology, pathology, epidemiology, clinical medicine, toxicology, phytopathology, veterinary medicine, and other fields who have dedicated themselves to the great struggle against germ warfare. Entomology experts explained based on scientific knowledge that the distribution, seasons of occurrence, and locations of the insects, spiders, and other objects found in Korea and Northeast China are completely abnormal. These abnormal situations can only be explained by the fact that these insects and objects were deliberately spread by U.S. aggressors, and there can be no other explanation.

    The exhibition displays various pictures showing the abnormal seasons and locations of insect appearances, such as springtails being found in early February on the steel and concrete bleachers of the racecourse in Fushun, six meters above the ground; crickets are insects that overwinter as eggs, but appeared in large numbers on the snow in March. For example, the minimum temperature for house flies and green bottle flies to be active should be above 15 degrees Celsius, but the climate at the time of discovery was between -10 and 5 degrees Celsius. Entomologists have examined the temperature records of the areas where insects were found from January to March 15 this year and found that the local temperature never exceeded 10 degrees Celsius.

    Our country's prestigious experts in entomology, microbiology, pathology, epidemiology, clinical medicine, toxicology, phytopathology, and veterinary medicine have conducted scientific inspections and identifications of the insects, spiders, and other objects spread by the U.S. government. The exhibition displays the following nine types of insects and spiders carrying pathogens: human fleas: carrying plague bacillus; house flies: carrying anthrax bacillus; black flies: carrying anthrax bacillus, dysentery bacillus, typhoid bacillus, and paratyphoid bacillus; specimen insects: carrying anthrax bacillus; wolf spiders: carrying anthrax bacillus, dysentery bacillus, and hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella; big house flies and midges: carrying typhoid bacillus; dung flies: carrying paratyphoid bacillus; springtails: carrying dysentery bacillus.

    The exhibition displays the following nine other objects carrying pathogens: field mice: carrying plague bacillus; feathers: carrying anthrax bacillus; frogs: carrying typhoid bacillus; catfish: carrying paratyphoid bacillus; small fish: carrying dysentery bacillus; clams: carrying cholera vibrio; corn kernels: carrying corn smut fungus; soybean stems and pods: carrying soybean purple stain fungus; leaves: carrying plant anthrax fungus and ring spot fungus.

    The exhibition systematically introduces insects and other objects that harm humans, livestock, and crops, such as big house flies carrying typhoid bacillus, small field mice carrying plague bacillus, wolf spiders carrying hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella, feathers carrying anthrax bacillus, and corn kernels carrying corn smut fungus, through various pictures and inspection reports.

    The flies dropped by U.S. aircraft in the Northeast People's Government Trade Department dormitory area in Shenyang City on March 15 were identified by entomologists Chen Shixiang and Lu Baolin as big house flies. Bacteriologist Jing Guanhua conducted a scientific and thorough examination of these flies and found that they carried typhoid bacillus.

    On April 4, U.S. aircraft invaded the airspace of Gannan County, Heilongjiang Province. On the morning of the 5th, many small field mice were found in 31 of the 45 villages in the Xinmin, Minzhong, Gongyi, and Gongnong four villages of the tenth district of the county, totaling 717. They were distributed in the wild, in puddles, in houses, on roofs, in vegetable cellars, and in wells. Bacteriological experts proved that these small field mice carried plague bacillus.

    On February 29, Zhao Guangxin and other residents of Laoguan Village, Benxi, suddenly discovered many "eight-legged insects," which were identified by arachnologist Wang Fengzhen and entomologist Lu Baolin as wolf spiders. Many photos on the display board showed the experiment of injecting the cultured bacteria from the wolf spiders into ducks and rabbits. As a result, the ducks and rabbits died within two days. Experts Jing Guanhua and Xie Shaowen then injected white mice, and the white mice also died. The same bipolar staining bacilli were found in the experiments, which were identified as hemorrhagic septicemia Pasteurella. This bacterium causes severe hemorrhagic septicemia in poultry and livestock and can harm humans.

    On March 12, eight U.S. aircraft invaded the Kuandian area of ​​Liaodong Province, one of which dropped a chalky germ bomb. About eight meters northwest of the bomb crater, there were many feathers. The Chinese bacteriologists Xie Shaowen and Zhang Naichu checked these feathers and separated out anthrax bacillus.

    On March 19, in the Andong area, where U.S. aircraft had spread insects and other objects, farmer Fu Min of Sunjiabaozi, Wulongbei District, first discovered many bacteria-carrying corn kernels by the river. Professor Shen Qiyi of the Department of Plant Pathology of Beijing Agricultural University checked and found that these corn kernels carried corn smut fungus. He said in the identification report: "This corn smut fungus belongs to Thecaphora sp. It causes disease in many leguminous plants in the Americas and Europe, and has never been found in China."

    In some areas of Northeast China invaded by U.S. aircraft, we suddenly discovered anthrax of the respiratory system, hemorrhagic anthrax meningitis, and another acute infectious disease that we have never seen before. The clinical phenomenon of the latter conforms to acute encephalitis. The exhibition displays photos of the brain, lungs, spinal cord, and other parts of the deceased who suffered from these diseases.

    The fourth room of the exhibition displays cases of cholera and plague that occurred in Korea. Cholera had not occurred in Korea after 1947, and the cholera that occurred in Han Sang-guk in Pyongyang City appeared in early March when it was still quite cold, after Han Sang-guk captured and destroyed the large number of flies dropped by U.S. aircraft. This was clearly directly caused by the germ warfare conducted by the U.S.

    Korea has not had the plague for many years, and the report on Korean epidemics printed by the U.S. Department of the Navy also confirmed this. The original of this report is also displayed in the exhibition. However, plague patients were suddenly found in areas where U.S. aircraft dropped mice. Ge Quanshu, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, was killed by plague bacteria. Ge Quanshu entered Korea in November 1950. He suddenly fell ill on the afternoon of March 4 this year and unfortunately died on March 7. Scientific testing determined that the cause of his death was septicemic plague.

    The fourth room also displays examples of U.S. aircraft spreading plant pathogens in Korea. Soybean stems and pods carrying purple spot fungus are a serious pathogen of soybeans that can live on the pods for one to two years. Leaves carrying plant anthrax fungus are pathogens that harm apples, pears, and cotton. From this, people can see how vicious the U.S. aggressors are!

    The center of the last exhibition room is the introduction of the "Joint Interrogation Team of Korean and Chinese Experts and Reporters." On the left are photos of the International Scientific Commission conducting on-the-spot investigations in Northeast China and Korea, photos of the Korean branch of the "Investigation Team of U.S. Imperialist Germ Warfare Crimes" conducting on-the-spot investigations on the front line, and enlarged photos of the supplementary confessions of U.S. Air Force prisoners Enoch and Quinn; on the right are two handwritten answers by U.S. Air Force prisoners Enoch and Quinn to the "Joint Interrogation Team of Korean and Chinese Experts and Reporters" and enlarged photos of the original texts of the confessions of U.S. Air Force prisoners O'Neill and Kernis, as well as photos of the International Scientific Commission members questioning Enoch, Quinn, O'Neill, and Kernis. In the glass cabinet in this exhibition room are displayed the "Report of the Joint Interrogation Team of Korean and Chinese Experts and Reporters" interrogating the two prisoners Enoch and Quinn and the interrogation records and supplementary confessions of the two prisoners in four languages, as well as the original texts of the interrogation records in the handwriting of the two prisoners. The original texts of the confessions of O'Neill and Kernis are also displayed in the glass cabinet. Most notably, there are also recordings of Enoch, Quinn, O'Neill, and Kernis narrating the truth about the U.S.'s germ warfare. Singh, a representative of the Indian Trade Union who was invited to participate in the "May 1" Labor Day celebrations in our country, and another Australian trade union representative listened to the recordings of Enoch and Quinn twice while visiting the exhibition. They clearly heard the dialects of Quinn and Enoch. Singh later expressed his views at a symposium: When I came to see the exhibition, I had no prejudice and was carrying a skeptical attitude, like an impartial judge, to see if there was convincing evidence. However, when I walked out of the exhibition, I was completely convinced. I believe that U.S. imperialism is conducting germ warfare, which is a threat to humanity.

    不容抵赖的罪证
    ——美国政府细菌战罪行展览会巡礼
    新华社记者  刘鸣、林麟
    美国政府细菌战罪行展览会设在北京故宫博物院文华殿。五间陈列室里陈列着美国准备与进行细菌战争的史实、人证、物证和亲历现场的公正无私的中外人士的调查报告。这些史实、人证和物证都有中文、俄文、英文、法文四种文字的说明。展览会用确凿的事实和科学的结论向全世界人民证明了美国政府进行细菌战的罪行。历史的事实
    在第一间陈列室里，陈列着证明美国政府十年来进行细菌战准备工作的图片、书报和文件。美国前陆军部化学作战处生物作战委员会主席米尔克在一九四六年一月四日给陆军部长柏德逊的报告中说，美国政府一九四一年就开始设立从事研究和制造细菌武器的专门机构。制造细菌武器的中心机关是美国陆军部化学作战处所属的狄特里克兵营。一九五一年十月八日的美国“生活”杂志列举了十六种细菌武器。前美国狄特里克兵营细菌工厂空投传染部主任罗斯培里在一九四九年发表的“和平或瘟疫”一书中承认：狄特里克兵营的许多实验室工作人员在制造细菌武器时，曾染上上述十六种细菌武器中的波状热、野兔热、鹦鹉热、炭疽等病。陈列品证明了美国陆军、海军、空军都曾疯狂地准备细菌战争。陈列品又证明，美帝国主义把日本细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏和德国纳粹细菌战犯施莱勃都收罗起来，准备进行细菌战。
    在今年一月美国在朝鲜和中国发动细菌战争后，美国反动派进行了狂妄的宣传。美国陆军化学兵团研究发展处处长克利西今年一月二十五日在华盛顿说：“细菌、毒气和放射性物质可能证明是征服敌人的最廉价的武器。”三月二十一日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”竟狂妄到公然说：“并没有禁止细菌武器的国际公法！”就在这句话的左侧，展览着禁用窒息性、有毒的或其他瓦斯以及细菌武器的一九二五年六月十七日日内瓦议定书。
    不容抵赖的铁证
    展览会的第二陈列室陈列着朝鲜朴宪永外务相和我国周恩来外交部长抗议美国政府进行细菌战的声明、“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”在朝鲜和东北进行实地调查的照片、国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的照片、调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会的照片、被中国人民志愿军俘获的供认投掷细菌弹的美国空军人员凯尼斯·罗埃德·伊纳克和约翰·奎恩的像片以及放大摄制的他们的英文供词全文，供认证明美国在朝鲜前线进行细菌战的美俘马汶·勃朗的像片和供词，和美军派来刺探细菌战效果情报的空降特务王琦、唐巨升、李兴顺、谭泽民、张贵堂的像片和供词。
    在展览会的第三间陈列室里，四壁布满了鉴定过的美机投下的昆虫及其他物体的标本、说明、放大的照片、昆虫或细菌学的鉴定报告书和专家们化验检视情形的照片，室中的玻璃柜内排列着很多架显微镜，在显微镜里可以看到各种昆虫和检查出来的菌类的形态。这间陈列室还陈列着美军撒布昆虫等物容器的一部分：
    一种是四格型细菌弹，这种细菌弹发现最多，在展览会上陈列的有十颗，每颗都附有说明，说明上写着它们被美国飞机投掷下来的时间、地点，以及证人和该弹落地后突然出现的昆虫的密集情状。这种细菌弹全长一百三十七公分，直径三十六点四公分。弹壳由两瓣钢皮构成，厚零点一五公分，内分四格。美国侵略者曾经狡辩说，这不过是一种“宣传品炸弹”。但是本年四月五日美联社报道，美国众议院拨款小组委员会主席赛克斯在听取了美国化学兵团司令布伦的秘密作证以后，公开对报界说：“他（指布伦）说，在敌人领土上散播细菌的工具是简单的，这种装备现在部队已有充分储存……如目前用以投掷宣传传单的容器。”这一报道就在该弹的附近陈列出来。
    第二种是带有降落伞的纸筒型细菌容器，大同小异的有两种。展览会上陈列的其中有一个是二月二十九日美机在朝鲜谷山郡葛峙里投下的。发现时盖已脱落，伞上带有英文标志USC等字样，内有黑蝇摇蚊等昆虫和蜘蛛。该弹全长三十六公分，直径十三公分，弹顶系有人造丝织的降落伞，下端装有定时引信，到一定时间筒底脱落，昆虫四散。
    第三种是白垩质细菌弹。该弹外壳用白垩质制成，外涂铝漆，弹中有一铁轴，长二十八公分，其一端连一钢板。弹壳甚脆，落地后完全破碎。在落弹地方发现了很多蝇子、蜘蛛和羽毛。据物理学专家推测，弹形为一端半球形圆柱体。
        “我们已经得到了充分的科学证据，证明美帝国主义在朝鲜和我国确实使用着细菌武器，这是不容抵赖的！”这是献身于伟大的反细菌战斗争的我国五十四位昆虫学、微生物学、病理学、流行病学、临床医学、毒物化学、植物病理学、兽医学等各科专家们联名在展览会上发表的严正声明。昆虫学专家根据科学知识说明，在朝鲜和我国东北发现的昆虫、蜘蛛和其他物体，它们的分布情况、出现季节和出现场所都是完全反常的。这些反常的情况，除了说明这些昆虫和物体是美国侵略者有计划地撒布的以外，不可能有其他任何解释。
    展览会上陈列了表明昆虫出现季节和出现场所反常的各种图片，如黑跳虫在二月初在抚顺跑马场钢骨水泥看台上离地六公尺高的地方被发现；油葫芦是以卵过冬的昆虫，却在三月间的雪面上大批出现。又如家蝇、绿蝇等活动时的温度，最低亦应在摄氏十五度以上，但发现时的气候却在摄氏零下十度到五度间。昆虫学家们曾检查了发现昆虫的地区自本年一月到三月十五日的气温记载，发现当地气温从未超过摄氏十度。
    我国具有声望的昆虫学专家、微生物学专家、病理学专家、流行病学专家、临床医学专家、毒物化学专家、植物病理学专家、兽医学专家等对美国政府撒布的昆虫、蜘蛛和其他物体作了科学的检验和鉴定。展览会上陈列的带有病原体的昆虫和蜘蛛有下面九种：人蚤：带有鼠疫杆菌；家蝇：带有炭疽杆菌；黑蝇：带有炭疽杆菌、痢疾杆菌、伤寒杆菌和副伤寒杆菌；标本虫：带有炭疽杆菌；狼蛛：带有炭疽杆菌、痢疾杆菌和出血性败血症巴氏杆菌；大家蝇和摇蚊：带有伤寒杆菌；粪蝇：带有副伤寒杆菌；黑跳虫：带有痢疾杆菌。
    展览会上陈列的带有病原体的其他物体有下面九种：田鼠：带有鼠疫杆菌；羽毛：带有炭疽杆菌；青蛙：带有伤寒杆菌；鲶鱼：带有副伤寒杆菌；小鱼：带有痢疾杆菌；蛤：带有霍乱弧菌；玉米粒：带有黑粉菌；大豆茎、荚：带有大豆紫斑病菌；树叶：带有植物炭疽菌和轮纹病菌。
    展览会对带伤寒杆菌的大家蝇，带鼠疫杆菌的小田鼠，带出血性败血症巴氏杆菌的狼蛛，带炭疽杆菌的羽毛，带黑粉病菌的玉米粒等危害人、牲畜、农作物的昆虫和其他物体，通过各种图片和检验报告，有重点地作了系统的介绍。
    三月十五日在沈阳市内东北人民政府贸易部宿舍一带发现的美机投下的蝇子，经昆虫学家陈世骧、陆宝麟鉴定为大家蝇。细菌学家景冠华将这种蝇子作了科学的周密的检验，发现这些大家蝇带有伤寒杆菌。
    四月四日，美机曾侵入黑龙江省甘南县上空，五日晨于该县十区新民、民众、公议、工农四个村的四十五个屯中，有三十一个屯发现了很多小田鼠，总计找到七一七只。分布场所在野外、水坑、屋内、屋顶、菜窖及井内。这种小田鼠经细菌学专家检验证明带有鼠疫杆菌。
    二月二十九日，本溪老官村居民赵广新等突然发现许多“八条腿的虫子”，经蜘蛛学家王凤振、昆虫学家陆宝麟鉴定为狼蛛。陈列板上有很多幅照片显示着将狼蛛培养出的菌种注射入鸭和家兔体内进行实验，结果鸭、兔都在两日内死亡。景冠华和谢少文两专家先后又对小白鼠进行注射，结果小白鼠也都死亡，在实验中都发现同样的两端浓染杆菌，经检定为出血性败血症巴氏杆菌。此菌在家禽及家畜中引起严重的出血性败血症，并能侵害人类。
    三月十二日，美国飞机八架侵入辽东省的宽甸地区，其中一架投下了一颗白垩质细菌弹，在这弹坑的西北约八公尺的地方，有不少羽毛。这羽毛经我国细菌学专家谢少文、张乃初检查，分离出炭疽杆菌。
    三月十九日，在美机投撒过昆虫及其他物体的安东地区，五龙背区孙家堡子农民傅敏最先在河边发现了很多带菌玉米粒。北京农业大学植物病理系教授沈其益博士检查出这些玉米粒带有黑粉菌，他在鉴定书说：“这种黑粉菌属于Thecaphora sp．，在美洲和欧洲使很多豆科植物生病，在中国是从来没有发现过的。”
    在美机侵入过的东北某些地区，突然发现了我们从来没有看见过的呼吸系统的炭疽病及出血性炭疽杆菌脑膜炎、和另一种急性传染病，后者的临床现象符合于急性脑炎。展览会上陈列了这些病的死者的脑、肺、脊髓等部病变的照片。
    展览会的第四室陈列着发生在朝鲜的霍乱和鼠疫病例。一九四七年后朝鲜没有发生过霍乱，而且这次在平壤市韩相国家发生的霍乱是出现在还相当寒冷的三月初旬，是在韩相国捕灭美机撒下的大量的蝇子之后。这显然是美国进行的细菌战所直接造成的。
    朝鲜多年来没有鼠疫，美国海军部印发的朝鲜流行病的报告也肯定了这一点，展览会上还陈列了这报告的原件。但在美国飞机投掷老鼠的地区内突然发现了鼠疫病人。中国人民志愿军战士葛权书就是被鼠疫菌害死的。葛权书是一九五○年十一月入朝的，在今年三月四日下午突然发病，到三月七日不幸牺牲。科学方法的检验，断定其死亡的原因为败血性鼠疫。
    在第四室里还陈列了美国飞机在朝鲜撒布植物病菌的例证。带着紫斑病菌的大豆茎、荚，是一种为害大豆严重的病菌，它能在豆荚上活一年到二年之久，带有植物炭疽病菌的叶片，是为害苹果、梨及棉花的病菌。从这里，人们可以看出，美国侵略者的居心是何等狠毒！
    展览会的最后一间陈列室的正中是“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”的介绍，左面陈列着国际科学委员会在东北和朝鲜实地调查的照片，“美帝国主义细菌战罪行调查团”朝鲜分团在前线实地调查的照片和美国空军战俘伊纳克、奎恩补充供词的放大照片；右面陈列着美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩对“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”讯问的两份亲笔答词和美国空军战俘奥尼尔、克尼斯供词原文的放大照片，以及国际科学委员会委员询问伊纳克、奎恩、奥尼尔、克尼斯的照片。在这间陈列室的玻璃橱内陈列着四种文字的“朝中专家记者联合讯问团”讯问伊纳克及奎恩两战俘报告书和讯问录以及该两战俘亲笔的讯问录和补充供词的原文。玻璃橱内还陈列着奥尼尔和克尼斯供词的原文。最引人注意的还有伊纳克、奎恩、奥尼尔、克尼斯四人口述美国进行细菌战真相的录音。应邀参加我国“五一”节观礼的印度工会代表辛格和另一位澳大利亚工会代表在参观展览会时曾经听了两次伊纳克和奎恩的录音，他们清楚地听出奎恩和伊纳克用土音说话的语腔。辛格后来在座谈会上发表观感说：当我来看展览会时，我是一点成见都没有，并且还带着一种怀疑的态度，像一个公正的法官一样，看是否有使人信服的证据。可是，当我走出展览会时，我完全信服了。我相信美帝国主义正在进行细菌战，这是对人类的威胁。
