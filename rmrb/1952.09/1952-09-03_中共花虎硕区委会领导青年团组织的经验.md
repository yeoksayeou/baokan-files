    The CCP Hua Hu Shuo District Committee's Experience in Leading the Communist Youth League Organization
    Yang Enpu
    The CCP's Hua Hu Shuo District Committee in the Left Middle Banner of Inner Mongolia often pays attention to leading the Communist Youth League organization, making the local Communist Youth League organization a true and powerful assistant to the Party, completing various tasks assigned by the Party.
    I. Familiarize themselves with the actual situation of the League organization and provide practical guidance to the League organization's work
    Wu Li Ji Bai Yi, Secretary of the CCP Hua Hu Shuo District Committee, said: "To lead the League's work well, we must be familiar with and grasp the situation of the League." Therefore, all seven members of the CCP Hua Hu Shuo District Committee pay attention to studying the League Constitution and all instructions and documents related to the League's work. They also pay attention to studying and discussing the League's work plans and summaries for each period. Therefore, each District Committee member not only clearly understands the nature and tasks of the League, but also knows the current situation of the local League organization very well.
    Before each movement, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee always seriously discusses the work plan proposed by the League District Committee. At the end of the movement, they also help the League District Committee summarize the work. For example, in late March of this year, the League District Committee proposed to reorganize six branches in the drought prevention movement. After discussion, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee believed that the League's existing strength could only reorganize four branches. The League District Committee revised its plan based on the opinions of the Party's District Committee. When the League District Committee was carrying out the reorganization of the branch, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee appointed two District Committee members to assist. As a result, the reorganization of the four branches was completed as scheduled. The League District Committee was very satisfied with this.
    The Hua Hu Shuo District Committee also often gives the League District Committee the work instructions of the higher Party committee to read, so that they can understand the intentions of the higher Party committee and consciously complete the various tasks given by the Party.
    II. Cultivate cadres and improve the leadership ability of the League District Committee
    In leading the work of the League organization, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee often pays attention to improving the leadership ability of the League District Committee and giving play to the leadership role of the League District Committee. The method is to strengthen the education and training of the Communist Youth League cadres and improve their leadership ability. When it was discovered that the leadership of the League District Committee was always staying at general appeals and the work progress was very slow, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee held a meeting to study it. As a result, it was found that the League District Committee did not know how to use the leadership method of combining key points with the overall situation, so they ran around and were busy all day long, but could not make any achievements. Then, the District Committee instructed the League District Committee to convene a meeting to specifically solve this problem. And designated Comrade Chang Ming, Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, to participate in the leadership of this
    meeting. After a heated discussion, everyone learned the leadership method of combining key points with the overall situation. According to the spirit of this meeting, when carrying out the production competition, in addition to making general appeals, the League District Committee, with Secretary Na Mu Ji Lang, took the League branch of the fourth village as a base point to create experience. After gaining experience, the League District Committee mobilized League member Na Min Bu and his mutual aid group to challenge all League members in the district; and convened a joint meeting of League branch secretaries in the district, introducing the experience of the League branch of the fourth village in organizing production competitions. At the same time, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee also issued a notice to the entire district, praising this typical example and asking everyone to learn from it. As a result, sixty-one perennial mutual aid groups in the district participated in the production competition, which strongly promoted spring plowing and sowing and weeding work. And the work of the League District Committee has also turned to in-depth from then on.
    To strengthen the leadership of the League organization, we should also pay attention to enriching the cadre strength of the League organization. In addition to transferring two outstanding League members to serve as the organization secretary and propaganda secretary of the League District Committee, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee also decided that two District Committee members would concurrently serve as members of the League District Work Committee to strengthen the leadership of the League.
    III. Strengthen the Party's education of League members and give play to the shock role of League members
    The Hua Hu Shuo District Committee pays great attention to the education of League members and has designated seven Party members to be responsible for the education of League members. Wu Li Ji Bai Yi, Secretary of the District Committee, told these comrades: "This is the task assigned by the Party. We must responsibly educate League members to strengthen the Party's reserve force." It is also stipulated that these comrades should hold regular meetings to study the content of League education and exchange teaching experiences. This ensures that the League's education can be carried out frequently and universally. According to statistics, in the second half of last year, each League branch was lectured an average of eight times, so that League members were familiar with the basic knowledge of the League, their awareness was improved, and their role was further developed.
    When the entire district was carrying out Party rectification education, the Hua Hu Shuo District Committee took the initiative to organize League members to participate in the study of communism and the Communist Party. After this study, the awareness of League members was further improved.
    Due to the strong leadership of the District Committee, the League organization in Hua Hu Shuo District has played a shock role in various movements and promoted various movements. Taking this spring's production and disaster relief movement as an example, at the beginning of the movement, the thinking of the broad masses was chaotic, some were pessimistic and disappointed, and some wanted to go out to escape the famine, and had no intention of carrying out production and disaster relief work. At this time, the League District Committee called on all League members in the district to cooperate with Party members to take the lead in rushing to carry out production and disaster relief work and change the emotions of the broad masses. Soon, the masses of the entire district were involved in the production and disaster relief movement.

    中共花虎硕区委会领导青年团组织的经验
    杨恩普
    中共内蒙古科左中旗花虎硕区委会经常注意对青年团组织的领导，使当地青年团组织真正成为党的有力助手，完成了党所分配的各项任务。
    一、熟习团组织的实际情况，切实指导团组织的工作
    中共花虎硕区委书记乌力吉白乙说：“要想领导好团的工作，就要熟习和掌握团的情况。”因此中共花虎硕区委会的七个委员，个个都能够注意学习团章和有关团的工作的一切指示和文件。对于团的各个时期的工作计划、总结，也都注意研究、讨论。因此，每个区委委员不但对团的性质、任务了解得很清楚，而且对于当地团组织的现状也十分了解。
    在每一运动之前，花虎硕区委总要认真讨论一次团区委所提出的工作计划。在运动结束时，又帮助团区委总结工作。例如，今年三月下旬，团区委提出要在防旱运动中整理六个支部。花虎硕区委经过讨论，认为按照团的现有力量还只能整理四个支部。团区委就根据党的区委的意见，修改了自己的计划。团区委在进行整理支部工作时，花虎硕区委又指定两个区委委员予以协助。结果如期完成了四个支部的整理工作。团区委对此十分满意。
    花虎硕区委会还经常把上级党委的工作指示给团区委阅读，使他们了解上级党委的意图，自觉地去完成党所给的各项任务。
    二、培养干部，提高团区委的领导能力
    花虎硕区委在领导团组织的工作中，要经常注意提高团区委的领导能力，发挥团区委的领导作用。其方法是加强对青年团干部的教育和培养，提高他们的领导能力。当发现团区委的领导老是停留在一般号召上、工作进展很慢时，花虎硕区委就召开会议，进行研究，结果发现团区委不会运用点面结合的领导方法，以致东跑西走，终日忙碌，而作不出什么成绩来。接着区委会指示团区委召开会议，具体解决这一问题。并指定区委副书记长命同志参加对这
    一会议的领导。经过热烈的讨论，大家学会了点面结合的领导方法。根据这次会议的精神，在开展生产竞赛时，团区委除进行一般号召外，书记那木吉郎就以第四村的团支部为基点，创造经验。在取得经验后，团区委发动团员那民布和他的互助组向全区团员挑战；并召开全区团支部书记联席会议，介绍了第四村团支部组织生产竞赛的经验。同时，花虎硕区委也向全区发出通报，表扬这个典型，要大家学习。结果，全区有六十一个常年互助组参加了生产竞赛，有力地推动了春耕播种和铲?工作。而团区委的工作也从此转向深入。
    要加强对团组织的领导，还应注意充实团组织的干部力量。花虎硕区委除抽调两名优秀团员充任团区委的组织干事和宣传干事之外，又决定由两个区委委员兼任团区工委委员，以加强团的领导力量。
    三、加强党对团员的教育，发挥团员的突击作用
    花虎硕区委对于团员的教育是十分注意的，指定了七名党员担任团员的教育工作。区委书记乌力吉白乙告诉这些同志：“这是党所交给的任务，要负责地教育好团员，以加强党的后备力量。”又规定这些同志要经常开会研究团的教育内容，交流教学经验。这样保证了团的教育能够经常地普遍地进行。据统计，去年下半年平均给每一个团支部上课八次，使团员熟习了团的基本知识，提高了他们的觉悟，更加发挥了他们的作用。
    全区进行整党教育时，花虎硕区委又主动地组织团员参加了关于共产主义和共产党的学习。经过这一学习，团员的觉悟进一步提高了。
    由于区委的有力的领导，花虎硕区的团组织在各种运动中都发挥了突击作用，推动了各项运动。以今春的生产救灾运动说，在运动开始时，广大群众的思想是混乱的，有的悲观失望，有的要出外逃荒，无心进行生产救灾工作。这时团区委号召全区团员配合党员带头突击生产救灾工作，转变广大群众的情绪。不久，全区群众都卷入了生产救灾运动。
