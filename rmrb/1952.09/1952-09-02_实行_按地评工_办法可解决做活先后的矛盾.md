    Implementing the "Land-Based Work Point Assessment" Method Can Resolve the Conflict of Prioritizing Work
    Editor: During this year's summer hoeing season, the mutual aid team of Dongwenzhuang Village, District Seven, Taiyuan City, developed a "land-based work point assessment" method, which solved the problem of the order of hoeing. This method involves first assessing the number of work points required for each piece of land in the team under normal hoeing conditions, and then arranging the hoeing order. If a piece of land was originally assessed to require only five work points, but more work points were used due to being hoed later, it is still calculated as five work points. If fewer work points are used than originally assessed, the excess work points are converted into wages and used as the team's common property. (Editor's note: If work points are saved due to team members' active labor, the wages should belong to those team members.) The number of work points is democratically assessed by an evaluation team composed of representatives from each group. After implementing the "land-based work point assessment" method, everyone felt satisfied. Many mutual aid teams in the district have now adopted this method. Many temporary mutual aid teams have developed into permanent mutual aid teams because this method has solved the contradiction of everyone competing to be first when working during the busy farming season, and has implemented the principle of "equal value and mutual benefit."

    实行“按地评工”办法可解决做活先后的矛盾
    编辑同志：太原市七区东温庄村互助大队在今年夏锄期间，研究出一种“按地评工”的办法，解决了锄地的先后次序问题。这个办法是先评出组内土地在一般情况下锄地需要的工数，然后安排锄地次序。如果某块地原来评出只需要五个工，但因锄得较迟多用了工，仍按五个工计算；如果所用工数比原评工数还少，多余的工，折成工资，作为全组的公共财产。（编者按：如果因组员积极劳动而省了工，工资应归这些组员所有。）工数是由各组代表组成的评议小组民主评定的。实行“按地评工”的办法以后，大家都感到满意。现在该区许多互助组都采用了这个办法。很多临时互助组因为采用了这个办法，解决了农忙做活时大家争先的矛盾，贯彻了“等价互利”的原则，都已发展成为常年互助组。
