Xinhua News Agency report: People across the country warmly welcome and celebrate the release of the Sino-Soviet talks communique, cheering for the further consolidation of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    In the Northeast, after the publication of the Sino-Soviet talks communique, people from all walks of life in Dalian and Lüda excitedly reported their support for and celebration of the communique to the Lüda People's Daily and Lüda People's Broadcasting Station via telephone. Xue Jiru, a labor model in Lüda, excitedly said: "In recent years, under the personal assistance of Soviet factory director Sitrov, I have become the assistant factory director of the railway factory from an ordinary boiler worker. Thanks to the help of the Soviet big brother, the China Changchun Railway has become a model railway in terms of operation and management. In the future, we must work harder to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and scientific management methods." Hao Yingguang and other workers from the passenger car branch of the Dalian Railway Factory unanimously expressed that they would celebrate the achievements of the two countries in defending peace in the Far East with the action of quickly completing the "Peace" express train and welcoming international friends attending the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference.

    In the workers' dormitory of a factory in Lushunkou, workers crowded together to listen to the radio. Liu Lifu, the leader of the advanced production team in the factory, is leading his team to complete the first quarter task of 1956 ahead of schedule due to learning the Soviet Union's advanced work methods. He said: "We must work with Soviet comrades to consolidate the Lushunkou naval base and defend peace in the Far East. Let the American imperialists tremble in the face of the bronze wall of the solidarity and friendship between our Chinese and Soviet people!"

    The nationally renowned labor models who are studying at the Dalian Workers and Peasants Rapid Middle School were even more excited by the good news. Bi Guiying, the first female train driver in New China trained by Soviet experts, said: Before our dear teacher, Section Chief Lisov, returned to his country, he handed over all the work he was in charge of to the Chinese section chief and taught him management. When I think about how we can live such a happy and joyful life today, I think of our Soviet teachers. Zhao Guilan, a model for protecting the factory, and many industrial labor models have expressed one after another: Lushunkou is an important naval base for defending peace in the Far East. Because Japan has not yet concluded a treaty of peace with our country and the Soviet Union, it is jointly guarded by the armed forces of China and the Soviet Union, so we are not afraid of any imperialist aggression. In the Dalian Labor Park and Dalian Institute of Technology, more than 5,000 young workers and students gathered to celebrate that evening. Radio listening groups and newspaper reading groups in various neighborhoods throughout the city have held discussion meetings.

    In Qiqihar City, a band in five trucks was dispatched for publicity, and the city's Muslim Association also celebrated the happy event with horns and drums. Organs and organizations in Jilin City held a celebration evening for more than 1,000 people. In cities such as Andong and Harbin, railway workers spontaneously gathered to celebrate or hold discussions, and many workers who had just finished their night shifts also excitedly rushed to participate.

    In the celebration activities in various parts of Northeast China, the people expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the sincere and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union. The staff of the Jilin Railway Administration discussed one after another: The Soviet Union helped us manage the China Changchun Railway well and taught us a set of valuable experiences. We really don't know how to thank them. Zhao Lianyu, a labor model in Harbin, said: "Only the socialist Soviet Union under the leadership of Stalin can hand over the China Changchun Railway to China free of charge, and share the responsibility of opposing the collusion between the United States and Japan in aggression and defending peace in the East." Young students in Qiqihar City stayed up all night to write letters of thanks to Marshal Stalin. People's organizations in Songjiang Province also issued statements one after another, sincerely expressing their gratitude to the great ally, the Soviet Union.

    In East China, the news of the success of the Sino-Soviet talks reached the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Textile Factory, and the workers immediately posted large cartoons and quick reports with red characters at the factory gate. Workers in each workshop held rambling talks, expressing that they would further launch labor competitions and strive to over fulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy. Lu Agou, deputy director of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, decided to strive to complete the transformation of the spinning frame in the near future to thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their help after seeing the Sino-Soviet talks communique. More than 600 graduating students from universities and colleges in East China who were waiting at the Shanghai Railway Station to go to Northeast China to participate in the construction of the motherland were even more delighted. Zhu Huijuan, a student from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Jiaotong University, said: "We are happy to be taking up positions in the construction of the motherland, and we are even more excited to hear this news. I must contribute my strength to the construction of the motherland."

    In Central and South China, the workers of Hankou No. 1 Yarn Factory held a discussion. Sun Linglao, a labor model in the factory, said: "Preventing Japanese imperialist aggression is the main purpose of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Now that American imperialism and Japanese fascists are colluding more closely, our alliance with the Soviet Union can prevent its aggression. The decision to extend the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou naval base is really a wise measure."

    Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan who had suffered from the massacre by the Japanese army hated the American revival of Japanese aggression forces very much. The farmers of Liudian Township had personally seen the Japanese army slaughter more than 4,000 compatriots under a mountain in the township. They were particularly excited after seeing the Sino-Soviet talks communique.

    After hearing the news of the publication of the Sino-Soviet talks communique on the radio, the railway workers in Kaifeng City immediately gathered for a discussion. Yan Jiezhen, a famous labor model and director of the Kaifeng Railway Repair Factory, said: "The Soviet big brother handed over the Changchun Railway, which has been operating for many years, to us free of charge, which makes me extremely grateful. Our railway workers must work harder to produce and build more railways in our motherland in the future to repay the Soviet big brother for their friendship." Hu Guangbi's model production team in the factory guaranteed to complete the September production plan three days ahead of schedule during the discussion. All teachers and students of Henan Normal College held a grand celebration meeting on the 17th. After the meeting, a branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established in the school, and 95% of the teachers and students joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association as members.

    In Southwest China, the broadcasting station of Chongqing No. 101 Iron and Steel Plant continuously broadcast the news of the Sino-Soviet talks communique, and workshops, dining halls and squares were crowded with listeners. Cheng Helong's advanced team in the steel rail yard immediately convened a discussion. Workers expressed their determination to thank the Soviet people for their care by increasing production. Yue Songshan, a labor model in the factory, said excitedly after reading the communique: "Lushun is the outpost of our country's peace and security. Extending the term of the joint Sino-Soviet use of Lushunkou has made this outpost an iron bastion."

    In Northwest China, after seeing the news of the Sino-Soviet talks communique, the railway workers at Chang'an Station in Xi'an City immediately launched a discussion within the station. Jiang Mingzhi, a labor model who went to the Northeast last year to study Li Xikui's shunting method, and others are determined to do a good job in production to thank the Soviet people for their friendship. On the afternoon of the 17th, the members of the newspaper reading group of Changle East and West Fang in the seventh district of the city gathered 130 people to listen quietly to the newspaper reader read the Sino-Soviet talks communique. After everyone heard the contents of the communique, there was a long burst of applause, shouting:

    "Long live the unity of China and the Soviet Union", "Long live the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union" and other slogans. Representatives of various ethnic groups in the Northwest provinces who came to Xi'an to prepare to participate in the National Day ceremony in Beijing scrambled to read the newspapers publishing the Sino-Soviet talks communique. Xian Chunyi (Hui nationality, Islam), a representative from Gansu, said while reading: "This is really a wise decision." Bazar (Tajik nationality), a representative from Xinjiang, said: "The Soviet Union's agreement to extend the term of the joint use of the Lushunkou naval base is a major blow to the American aggression plan!"

    In North China, Li Shunda, a representative of the Chinese farmers' delegation to the Soviet Union who had just returned to Taiyuan, and a nationally renowned labor model, said excitedly when he saw the news of the Sino-Soviet talks communique published in the newspaper: "I traveled through five provinces in the Soviet Union this time, and wherever I went, I felt the sincere friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people." He said that this kind of friendship between China and the Soviet Union is the unshakable great force for defending world peace. Wang Guiying, a nationally renowned industrial labor model in the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, said: The free transfer of the China Changchun Railway fully demonstrates the sincere and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to our country. He expressed that he must work hard to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced production experience and improve the quality of production in the future to respond to the Soviet people's assistance.

    People from all walks of life in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province also warmly celebrated the achievements of the Sino-Soviet talks.

    在旅顺口某工厂的工人宿舍里，工人们挤得水泄不通收听广播。该厂先进生产小组长刘立富，由于学习了苏联的先进工作法，正在领导他的小组提前完成一九五六年的第一季任务。他说：“我们一定要和苏联同志一起巩固旅顺口海军根据地，保卫远东和平。让美帝国主义者在我们中苏人民友谊团结的铜墙铁壁面前发抖吧！”
