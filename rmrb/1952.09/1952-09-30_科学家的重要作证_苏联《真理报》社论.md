    Important Testimony of Scientists
    ——Soviet Pravda Editorial

    The American imperialists have brazenly trampled on international norms by using heinous bacteriological weapons in their war of aggression against the Korean people and in their plundering of Chinese territory.

    The use of bacteriological weapons by the American aggressors in Korea and China is a fact known throughout the world. The conclusions of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers' investigation team, the documents published by the Central People's Government of China and distributed by the World Peace Council, and the testimonies of prominent figures such as Johnson, Wen Youzhang, and Fudge have clearly proven that the American military is using weapons of inhuman large-scale massacre against the people of Korea and China that are prohibited by international conventions and despised by all peace-loving people.

    The International Scientific Commission has recently completed its investigation into the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. The International Scientific Commission was established after the Oslo meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, and is composed of prominent scientists from six countries: Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, and the Soviet Union. The International Scientific Commission has worked in China and Korea for more than two months. The commission thoroughly investigated various documents, discussed scientific issues related to the methods of the American military's use of bacteriological weapons, listened to many scientific reports from scientists of Korea and China, studied many pieces of material evidence, questioned hundreds of witnesses, conducted impartial field investigations, and spoke with captured American airmen.

    The International Scientific Commission's report – published in full in today's Pravda – provides detailed material exposing the barbaric crimes of the American aggressors. The commission's materials once again confirm that the American military, using the methods of Japanese war criminals, is dropping insects and various objects carrying deadly germs on peaceful cities and villages in Korea and China. The commission's report lists many deaths of Korean and Chinese people caused by the American military's use of bacteriological weapons.

    Based on scientific field investigations, the Scientific Commission reached the following conclusion:
    "The people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed been the targets of attacks by bacteriological weapons; the American military has used these bacteriological weapons in many different ways..."

    At the official signing ceremony of the commission's report, Professor Mandel, a member of the International Scientific Commission from France, said: "China and Korea have indeed been attacked by bacteriological warfare, and the American military should be held responsible for this. We will confirm these facts before the people of the world."

    British scientist Joseph Needham said at a press conference in London on September 26: "The American military used these bacteriological weapons in many different ways, some of which appear to be developments of the methods used by the Japanese military in conducting bacteriological warfare during World War II."

    The objective conclusions and scientific testimony of the International Scientific Commission are now known to people all over the world. These are yet another authoritative proof of the many facts of the American military conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. In the face of these facts, what value do the pathetic attempts of the American ruling clique to deny these terrible crimes have?

    The People's Daily, published in Burma, commented fairly on the International Scientific Commission's report: The Americans' use of bacteriological bombs in Korea has been irrefutably confirmed by on-the-spot investigations by scientists from various countries. Speaking of the American ruling clique's attempt to deny these facts, the newspaper said: This is not surprising, because a criminal, when being interrogated, always says he is innocent, even though there is irrefutable evidence in front of him. This has become a habit. But today this crime can no longer be denied.

    All honest people around the world feel hatred and indignation at the atrocities of the American interventionists.

    The World Peace Council, representing the opinions of all honest people, has issued a declaration calling for the cessation of bacteriological warfare and the prohibition of bacteriological weapons. In light of the conclusions of the International Scientific Commission, this declaration of the World Peace Council is of particular significance. It has received widespread response and universal support among the people of various countries.

    Mass rallies have been held in Korea and China to protest this bloody crime and the American military's use of heinous bacteriological weapons. The people of Korea and China wholeheartedly support the conclusions of the International Scientific Commission.

    The Democratic Korea newspaper expressed the opinion of the Korean people, saying: The honest people of the world will undoubtedly thank these scientists for their heroic work, who bravely fulfilled their glorious mission, collected many facts, and conducted scientific analysis and generalization of these facts. These facts irrefutably prove that Korea and China have become the targets of bacteriological weapons used by the American armed forces.

    The Chinese People's Daily pointed out: The Chinese people fully support the report of the International Scientific Commission. The newspaper emphasized: Even Hitler did not dare to use bacteriological weapons in World War II. It is unprecedented for the American aggressors to so brazenly violate all laws of war and international agreements, and to use bacteriological weapons on a large scale.

    The materials of the International Scientific Commission are an indictment against the American imperialists who planned bacteriological warfare in Korea and China.

    The Asian and Pacific Peace Conference will open in Beijing in the next few days. Guo Moruo, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize and chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, said: Our conference this time opposes the use of bacteriological weapons. We demand that the problems of Korea and Southeast Asian countries be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, and oppose violent interference in the internal affairs of others.

    The people of the world have also begun to understand more clearly why the American ruling clique, which launched a war of aggression in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, stubbornly opposes the adoption of the Soviet Union's proposal to prohibit atomic weapons in the United Nations. Similarly, it is no accident that the American representative has consistently evaded discussing this issue in the Security Council with representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea participating.

    The men and women of the Soviet Union, together with all peace-loving mankind, fully support the conclusions of the International Scientific Commission and resolutely protest the American military's use of heinous bacteriological weapons in Korea and China.

    The International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China issued this call at the end of its report.

    "Now, the people of the whole world should redouble their efforts to save the world from the scourge of war and to prevent scientific inventions from being used to destroy mankind."

    In response to this lofty call, the people of the world will unite more firmly and fight to safeguard and consolidate peace.

    科学家的重要作证
    ——苏联《真理报》社论
    美帝国主义者悍然践踏国际准则，竟在进攻朝鲜人民以及中国领土的掠夺战争中使用罪恶的细菌武器。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜和中国使用细菌武器是全世界尽人皆知的事实。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的结论，中国中央人民政府所发表并经世界和平理事会所散发的文件，以及若干知名人士如约翰逊、文幼章、法奇的作证，已经明明白白地证明了美军正在对朝中两国人民使用为国际公约所禁止，为全体爱好和平人类所不齿的灭绝人性的大规模屠杀人民的武器。
    国际科学委员会最近已完成了它的调查关于在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战事实的工作。国际科学委员会在世界和平理事会常务委员会奥斯陆会议之后成立，由瑞典、法国、英国、意大利、巴西和苏联六国的著名科学家所组成。国际科学委员会已在中国和朝鲜工作了两个多月之久。委员会彻底调查了各项文件，讨论了有关美军使用细菌武器的方法的科学上的问题，听取了朝中两国科学家的许多科学报告，研究了许多物证，询问了数百人证，进行了公正的实地调查并与被俘的美国空军人员谈了话。
    国际科学委员会报告书——今日的《真理报》已经刊载完毕——提供了揭露美国侵略者惨无人道的罪行的详细材料。委员会的材料再度证实：美军使用日本战犯的方法，正在向朝鲜与中国的和平城市与乡村投掷带有致命病菌的昆虫与各种东西。委员会报告书列出了许多由于美军使用细菌武器而造成的朝鲜与中国人民的死亡事件。
    根据实地的科学调查，科学委员会得出下列的结论：
    “朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标；美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，……”
    在委员会报告书正式签字仪式上，国际科学委员会委员、法国马戴尔教授说：“中国和朝鲜的确受到细菌战的攻击，美军是应该对此负责的。我们将在全世界人民面前来证实这些事实。”
    英国科学家李约瑟九月二十六日在伦敦举行记者招待会时说：“美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成的。”
    国际科学委员会的客观结论与科学家的作证，现在已经为全世界人所皆知了。这些是对于美军在朝鲜与中国进行细菌战的许多事实的又一次权威的证明。在这些事实面前，美国统治集团可怜地妄图否认这些可怕的罪行，究竟有什么价值呢？
    在缅甸出版的《人民报》在评论国际科学委员会报告书时公正地指出：美国人在朝鲜使用细菌炸弹，已经由各国科学家实地调查后无可辩驳地证实了。谈到美国统治集团企图否认这些事实时，该报说：这是不足为奇的，因为一个罪犯在受讯时，尽管他的面前放着无可置辩的证据，他也总是说自己是无罪的。这已成为惯例。但是今天这个罪行是再也不能抵赖了。
    全世界一切正直的人民都对美国干涉者的暴行感到憎恨与愤慨。
    世界和平理事会代表一切正直人民的意见，已发表了一项宣言——要求制止细菌战并禁止细菌武器。鉴于国际科学委员会的结论，世界和平理事会的这个宣言特别有意义。它在各国人民中间得到了广泛的响应和普遍的支持。
    朝鲜和中国纷纷举行群众集会，抗议这种血腥的罪行，抗议美军使用罪恶的细菌武器。朝中两国人民衷心拥护国际科学委员会的结论。
    《民主朝鲜》报表达朝鲜人民的意见说：全世界的正直人民无疑地将感谢这些科学家们的英勇的工作，他们曾勇敢地尽了他们的光荣任务，搜集了许多事实，并对这些事实进行了科学的分析与归纳。这些事实都不可辩驳地证明了朝鲜和中国已经成为美国武装部队使用细菌武器的对象。
    中国《人民日报》指出：中国人民全力拥护国际科学委员会的报告。该报强调说：在第二次世界大战中，连希特勒也还不敢使用细菌武器。美国侵略者如此悍然破坏一切战争法规和国际协定，大规模使用细菌武器，是史无前例的。
    国际科学委员会的材料是对策划在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的美帝国主义者的起诉书。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将于今后数天内在北京开幕。斯大林国际和平奖金的获得者、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若说：我们这一次的会议反对使用细菌武器。我们要求朝鲜及东南亚各国的问题迅速地得到和平解决，反对以暴力干涉别人内政。
    世界人民也已开始更加清楚地了解为什么在联合国旗帜下在朝鲜发动侵略战争的美国统治集团在联合国中顽固地反对通过苏联所提出的关于禁止原子武器的提案。同样，美国代表始终规避在有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加的安全理事会中讨论这个问题，这也不是偶然的。
    苏联男女人民和全体爱好和平的人类一道，完全支持国际科学委员会的结论，坚决抗议美军在朝鲜和中国使用罪恶的细菌武器。
    调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会在报告书最后发出了这样的号召。
    “现在，全世界的人民都应加倍努力，使世界免遭战祸，并制止科学的发明被用来毁灭人类。”
    世界人民为了响应这个崇高的号召，将要更加坚决地团结起来，为维护并巩固和平而斗争。
