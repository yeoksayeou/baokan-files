Xinhua News Agency Report: People across the country commemorated the seventh anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

    Shenyang: Representatives from all circles in Shenyang held a memorial ceremony at the Soviet Army Martyrs' Memorial Tower on the morning of September 3rd to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the liberation of Northeast China by the Soviet Army. After the meeting, representatives from all circles went to the Soviet Army Soldiers' Monument to pay their respects and held a commemorative meeting attended by more than 7,000 people. In the afternoon, a celebration meeting was held by all circles in Shenyang. Among those attending were Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Zhang Mingyuan, Secretary-General of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, totaling more than 1,500 people. Vasilyev, Vice Consul of the Soviet Consulate General in Shenyang, and Kim Gui-nam, representative of the Korean Embassy in China stationed in Shenyang, were also invited to participate and delivered speeches. Gao Chongmin, Vice President of the Northeast China-Soviet Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting. He said: The liberation of the people of Northeast China from the rule of Japanese fascism was the result of the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the support of the people across the country, and the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Northeast China. The people of Northeast China will never forget the great assistance of the Soviet army and its great contribution to the cause of peace. At present, American imperialism is following the old path of Japanese fascism, continuously establishing military bases in Asia and the Pacific region, sending troops to invade Korea, and stepping up the arming of Japan. This aggressive behavior of the United States has seriously threatened peace in Asia and the Pacific region. He said: Because the People's Republic of China has become unprecedentedly strong, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has become more consolidated, and the peace movement in Asia and the Pacific region is constantly rising, the American conspiracy of aggression can be completely crushed. The congress also adopted a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin.
    Central-South China, Hubei Province, and Wuhan City: Local organizations of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and people from all walks of life held a forum in Wuhan on the 3rd. More than a dozen representatives from local organizations of various democratic parties, labor models, religious figures, people's organizations, ethnic minorities, and business circles spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they unanimously believed that the reason why the Chinese people were able to defeat the powerful Japanese imperialism and achieve victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan was inseparable from the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as well as the active assistance of the Soviet Union.
    The Central-South China General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Preparatory Committee of the Central-South China Federation of Trade Unions, and five other organizations also issued a joint declaration on this day.
    Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City: Leaders of local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City successively delivered speeches to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. Yi Meihou, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Association, said: Most of us overseas Chinese living in Southeast Asia have suffered from the ravages of Japanese imperialism, and many of our overseas Chinese have been ruined by the Japanese invaders. Today, American imperialism is openly rearming Japan as its base for aggression in Asia, and we must resolutely oppose it.
    East China and Shanghai: The East China General Branch and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against American Aggression jointly held a forum on the 3rd to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. More than 50 people attended the forum, including standing committee members of the association and representatives from all walks of life in East China and Shanghai. At the meeting, Jin Zhonghua, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Branch, spoke. He said: This year, as we commemorate the seventh anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan, we must strive to strengthen our national defense and economic strength, unite with the people of all countries in Asia and the Pacific region, and unite with the people of the world to fight for the defense of the Far East and world peace. Shen Han, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, explained in his speech that the million workers in Shanghai are launching a patriotic production increase and economy campaign to support the Chinese People's Volunteers. Wu Yun'chu, Bao Dasan, Kui Yanfang, and other representatives from the Shanghai business community stated that they must strive to participate in the economic construction of the motherland to enhance our strength against aggression and defend peace.
    Chongqing: People from all walks of life in Chongqing held a forum on the 3rd, attended by more than 100 representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, combat heroes, and labor models. Chu Tunan, Chairman of the Southwest General Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, called on the people of Southwest China to greet the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference with greater achievements in the cause of peace. Qi Peiyuan, a representative of combat heroes, said: We are working hard to study military science and technology, and build a modern national defense force. If any imperialist dares to invade our motherland again, they will be made to suffer a bloody nose.
