    The German People's Determined Efforts to Achieve Peaceful Reunification

    The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic recently sent a delegation to Bonn to visit the President of the West German Federal Assembly, and in a letter to the West German Federal Assembly, put forward concrete suggestions on the issues of all-German participation in the Four-Power Conference and the organization of a German investigation team. This action by the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic is a major step in promoting negotiations on the peaceful reunification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. This will have a significant impact on the future of a peaceful resolution to the German question.

    It is known that the United States and its British and French lackeys have set up numerous obstacles on the road to concluding a peace treaty with Germany and promoting the peaceful reunification of Germany. In order to permanently divide Germany and create war, they have imposed the so-called "General Treaty" on the people of West Germany. This "treaty" indefinitely extends the US, British, and French occupation of West Germany and makes the reorganization of the West German Nazi army and participation in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc legal. At the same time, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are creating various pretexts to delay negotiations on the German peace treaty issue. Their delaying tactic is to reject the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a Four-Power Conference to discuss the preparation of a peace treaty with Germany, the establishment of an all-German government, the holding of free all-German elections, and the establishment of a fact-finding mission to investigate the elections. Instead, they insist that the organization of the investigation team must be discussed first, then an investigation conducted, then elections held, then an all-German government established, and only then can negotiations be held to prepare for a peace treaty. This step-by-step entanglement and layer-by-layer obstruction is clearly intended to bury the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and promoting German reunification in endless discussions.

    Undoubtedly, this delaying tactic by the United States, Britain, and France will indefinitely prolong the suffering of the German people in a state of division and continue to increase the risk of war. This is firmly opposed by the German people and the people of Europe and the world.

    In this situation, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic boldly extended its hand to the West German Federal Assembly, calling for mutual understanding. Mutual understanding between the German people is a necessary prerequisite for the peaceful resolution of the German question, and it is also the most effective way to break through and overcome the numerous obstacles set by the United States and its British and French lackeys on the German question. Because if the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the West German Federal Assembly reach an agreement on the issue of participating in the Four-Power Conference and organizing an all-German investigation team to conduct investigations into free elections, the United States, Britain, and France will have no reason to refuse to convene a Four-Power Conference to discuss the German peace treaty issue and engage in unreasonable entanglements in the arrangement of the agenda.

    The courageous action of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic represents the deep aspirations of the German people for peace, unity, and independence. Therefore, the delegation of the People's Chamber was warmly welcomed and supported by the people of West Germany in Bonn. This is a serious blow to the US, British, and French conspiracy to obstruct German reunification. Although the US, British, and French occupiers and their lackeys in West Germany are trying to obliterate the impact of this visit and want to portray it as a formal action, their attempts are in vain. Because the German people have seen from this fact the path of joint action to achieve peaceful reunification, and they will surely work to implement the goals pointed out by this path.

### 德国人民争取和平统一的坚毅努力

    德国人民争取和平统一的坚毅努力
    德意志民主共和国人民议会最近派代表团赴波恩访问了西德联邦议会主席，并在给西德联邦议会的信件中就全德参加四国会议和组织德国调查团问题提出了具体建议。德意志民主共和国人民议会的这一行动，是促进德国和平统一与缔结对德和约问题谈判的重大步骤。这对于和平解决德国问题的前途将发生重大影响。
    人们知道，美国及其英法仆从在缔结对德和约与促成德国和平统一的道路上设置了重重障碍。它们为了永久分裂德国并制造战争，已将所谓“一般性条约”强加在西德人民身上。这个“条约”无限期地延长了美英法对西德的占领，并使重新组织西德纳粹军队，参加北大西洋侵略集团成为合化法。与此同时，美英法三国政府并制造种种藉口，拖延对德和约问题的谈判。它们的拖延手法是拒绝苏联主张召开四国会议，以讨论准备对德和约，成立全德政府、举行全德自由选举与成立调查选举的调查团等问题的建议，而坚持必须先讨论调查团的组织，然后进行调查，然后举行选举，然后成立全德政府，然后才能谈判准备对德和约问题。这种步步纠缠，层层阻碍的做法，显然是想把缔结对德和约与促成德国统一的问题淹没在无休止的谈论中。
    毫无疑问，美英法的这种拖延手法将无限期地延长德国人民处于分裂的痛苦，并使战争危机继续增长。这是德国人民和欧洲与世界各国人民都坚决反对的。
    在这种情况下，德意志民主共和国人民议会果敢地向西德联邦议会伸出了手，要求相互的谅解。德国人民之间的相互谅解，是和平解决德国问题的必要前提，也是冲破和越过美国及其英法仆从设置在德国问题上的重重障碍的最有效的办法。因为德意志民主共和国人民议会和西德联邦议会如果在关于参加四国会议和组织全德调查团以进行调查自由选举的问题上达成了协议，美英法就没有任何理由拒绝召开四国会议以讨论对德和约问题，并在议程的按排上进行无理纠缠了。
    德意志民主共和国人民议会的果敢行动，代表了德国人民要求和平、统一和独立的深切愿望。因而，人民议会代表团在波恩受到了西德人民的热烈欢迎和拥护。这对于美英法阻碍德国统一的阴谋是一个严重的打击。尽管美英法占领者及其在西德的走狗力图抹杀这次访问的影响，并想把这次访问说成是一种形式上的行动，但它们的企图是徒然的。因为德国人民已从这个事实中，看出联合行动以实现和平统一的道路，他们一定会为贯彻这条道路所指出的目标而努力。
