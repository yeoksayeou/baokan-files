To the Japanese workers, farmers, young students, progressive intellectuals, and all other patriotic friends:

Last September, on the eve of the signing of the one-sided San Francisco “Treaty of Peace with Japan,” I wrote a letter to you. I received a friendly response from you, and I thank you for that. It will soon be the first anniversary, and now, on the eve of the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, I feel I must write another letter to you, expressing the concern of the Chinese people and myself for you.

Since the conclusion of the one-sided San Francisco “Treaty of Peace with Japan” and the so-called “U.S.-Japan Security Treaty,” the U.S. government and your Yoshida government concluded the U.S.-Japan “Administrative Agreement” on February 28th of this year. These "treaties" and "agreements," which stipulate that the United States will station troops in Japan for a long time, possess a large number of military bases, and enjoy extraterritorial rights, were actually declared "effective" on April 28th. On the same day, under the manipulation of the United States, your Yoshida government also signed the so-called "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty" with the Kuomintang in Taiwan.

Based on the developments of the past year, it seems that your homeland, under the control of the Yoshida government, which represents the interests of the United States, is increasingly embarking on the road of re-militarization to implement the aggressive policies of the United States. Recently, we also saw the signing of the "Facilities and Areas Agreement" between the U.S. government and the Yoshida government on July 26th, which stipulates even more clearly that Japan must continue to provide the U.S. occupation forces with 603 so-called "general facilities," including barracks, army, navy and air force training grounds, airports, naval bases, etc. - 300 of which are occupied indefinitely, and 303 of which are so-called temporary use. These "facilities and areas" include 11 airports, 18 auxiliary air force bases, 31 barracks, 32 ground force training grounds, 2 naval bases, and 18 large residential areas. In addition, there are some secret agreements concerning "communication facilities" and "civilian intelligence departments" that are military secrets and have not been announced. Looking at this situation, my statement in the previous letter that "Japan's fate today is, undeniably, the same as China's before liberation" is not an exaggeration at all.

Japanese people, in the past six years of occupation, have already borne $4.97 billion in military occupation expenses. Since gaining so-called "independence," the Japanese government has implemented a policy of re-militarization, which has increased Japan's budget this year by 30% compared to last year, with direct and indirect military expenditures accounting for 70% of the total budget. As a result, the lives of the Japanese people are becoming more and more difficult. It is said that the calorie content of food per person per day has decreased by 60% compared to the standard. Peaceful industries are suffering tremendous damage, and more than 6,700 small and medium-sized enterprises have been forced into bankruptcy.

Under such circumstances, your Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida has expressed his great ambitions. It is said that "the United States hopes that Japan will lead Asia," and he has expressed his determination to "respond to the hopes of the United States." This is what he said on August 4th when speaking to the leaders of Japan's disguised military department - the "National Safety Agency" headquarters. It turns out that Mr. Shigeru Yoshida was ordered by the United States to be the "Governor-General of Asia," a truly extraordinary ambition! However, regrettably, we do not know whether Asians need such a "Governor-General." Even if they do, it cannot be self-appointed by any hero, or bestowed by the U.S. government, can it?

A few years ago, when imperialist Japan had just begun to surrender, I made the following estimate of the remaining elements of Japanese politicians, financial groups, and military cliques, thinking that they would learn from Goujian, the King of Yue, who endured hardship and bided his time. I now know that this estimate was wrong. They originally just wanted to learn from Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor who sought glory by selling out his country. It is fitting that Shigeru Yoshida wants to sign a "Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek. As the saying goes, "birds of a feather flock together, and things are divided into groups." Puppets should naturally be categorized into the same display window, shouldn't they?

Patriotic Japanese friends, we can understand how you are being treated both spiritually and materially under such dual oppression. We Chinese adults grew up in such humiliating and indignant circumstances, and we have only been liberated from such circumstances for a few years. And our compatriots in Taiwan are still trapped in such circumstances, as water becomes deeper and fire becomes hotter. How can we get rid of such circumstances? Based on our own experience, we recognize very clearly that it is necessary to unite the people and wage a long-term patriotic struggle. Therefore, we hold deep respect for your patriotic actions in recent years to strive for independence, freedom, peace, and democracy, especially your efforts to oppose the re-militarization of Japan (which is in fact the colonization of Japan by the United States). Not only we Chinese people, but also the people of the world who love peace and justice. At the beginning of July this year, the World Peace Council held a special meeting in Berlin, and the "Resolution on Opposing the Re-militarization of Japan and Striving for the Establishment of a Democratic Japan," unanimously approved by 240 council members and specially invited representatives from 59 countries, is sincerely calling out to you. Please allow me to copy the last two sections of that "Resolution":

“The World Peace Council expresses its respect for the heroic struggle of the Japanese people for peace, independence and democracy, against militarist and war forces. The World Peace Council calls upon all other peoples of Asia and the Pacific to do their utmost to support this struggle. In this way, they can guarantee their own peaceful and democratic development. The World Peace Council further calls upon the peace-loving people of all countries under those governments that signed the San Francisco Treaty to fight for the conclusion of a genuine peace treaty.

To achieve this goal, the World Peace Council calls upon the peoples of Asia and the Pacific to do their utmost to mobilize the forces for peace and democracy for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be held in Beijing in the autumn of 1952. This conference will help to satisfactorily resolve the problems facing Japan and other countries in Asia and the Pacific." This resolution is correct and is in line with the will of the peace-loving people of the world. The Chinese people and the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are willing to accept this warm call and have long had a common determination to prepare to support you with greater strength. As you know, the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is the most concrete manifestation of this common determination. The scope of discussion for this regional peace conference, as indicated in the proposal of the preparatory meeting, will have four major items, but there is no doubt that the discussion of the Japan issue will inevitably become the central task of the conference. Because whether peace can be maintained in the Asian and Pacific regions is inextricably linked to whether Japan is re-militarized and whether the Japanese people can obtain a free and democratic life. Opposition to the re-militarization of Japan is the common demand of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, as well as the demand of the patriotic Japanese people. Enabling the Japanese people to strive for a free and democratic life is the wish of the patriotic Japanese people, as well as the common wish of the people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. This is an arduous struggle, and the patriotic Japanese people must stand at the forefront of this struggle. In the May Day parade this year, the patriotic Japanese people have demonstrated their heroic and unyielding spirit. The words of Takahashi Masao, a trade union member who died from injuries sustained during violent suppression, and his mother's words touched the hearts of the people of the world. Takahashi Masao's mother said at the founding meeting of the Tokyo Mothers' Association: "I found an application form in my son's bag, which read 'We want freedom, we want peace, we want a human life'; as his mother, I want to realize my son's wish." Who can not be moved by reading these words? This is just one example of the thousands upon thousands of Japanese mothers. There is no doubt that the peace-loving and just people of the Asian and Pacific regions will support the struggle of the Japanese people with their utmost strength; because they know for sure that supporting the Japanese people is also guaranteeing their own peaceful and democratic development.

Since the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in early June, the preparatory work in various countries has been progressing smoothly and has developed well in the past two or three months. Countries that had not been contacted before have since established good contacts. Countries such as Laos, Nepal, Panama, and Peru have all decided to send representatives to participate. The responses from various countries have been very enthusiastic, and representatives from many countries are already on their way to China. Among them, the rapid progress of the preparatory work by the patriotic Japanese people is very inspiring to us. We sincerely welcome the people's representatives of Japan to come to Beijing victoriously.

Our conference this time is a people's representative conference, and the purpose is just and honorable. Our purpose is to save peace. We demand the democratization of Japan and oppose the re-militarization of Japan; we demand universal disarmament and oppose the use of atomic energy, bacteria, and chemical weapons to kill large numbers of people; we demand the restoration of normal trade relations and cultural exchanges, and oppose blockades and embargoes; we demand that the problems of Korea and Southeast Asian countries be resolved peacefully as soon as possible, and oppose using violence to interfere in the internal affairs of others. These purposes are just and honorable, and they are not only the wishes of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, but also the common wishes of the people of the world who love peace and justice. We hope that countries with different systems can coexist peacefully, never invade others, and never be invaded by others; that we can help each other with or without mutual assistance on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, promote each other's peaceful construction to improve people's welfare, and seek common development. This is just and honorable, and anyone with a clear mind cannot oppose it.

Japanese friends, you probably remember that there have also been some recent international gatherings related to Asia and the Pacific. On July 28th, a five-nation meeting was held in Washington with the participation of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and Japan. Its central topic was to discuss Far East trade issues, especially to restrict Japanese business circles from trading with the People's Republic of China, and to try to make Japan turn its exports to Southeast Asian countries. What does this mean? To put it bluntly, it is not blocking us, but blocking Japan, and it is to cause conflicts between Japan and Britain in Southeast Asia. Isn't such a meeting a meeting of intrigue and each with their own plans? From August 4th to 6th, the so-called "U.S.-Australia-New Zealand Council" also held its first meeting in Honolulu, preparing to expand the so-called "Three-Nation Security Treaty" between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand into a "Pacific Convention," dragging Japan in as well, and taking "from the Bering Strait through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia to New Zealand" as a military scope, with Korea as an outpost. What does this mean? It is said to be "preventing communist aggression." However, Britain is also excluded from this maritime "Great Wall."

Our meeting is different from such meetings. No, we are just the opposite. What we want is not aggression, but peace. What we want is not blockades, embargoes, monopolies, but fair trade and equality and mutual benefit. We are not deceitful and scheming; we are open and aboveboard, and candid. We are not inciting hatred and want to solve problems with force; we advocate mutual understanding and replace force with the spirit of consultation. With this comparison, anyone with a clear mind should be very clear.

What is meant by "preventing communist aggression"? Who doesn't know that it is nothing more than the old trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief'"? Hitler, Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo were also singing such tunes every day when they were alive. However, who launched large-scale wars of aggression, causing the people of the world (including the German people, the Italian people, and the Japanese people) to have not yet recovered from the wounds of war to this day? There is no doubt that the Soviet Union is a communist country; we China are also firmly on the road to communist construction in the future, but who have we "invaded"? Does the Soviet Union have 603 military facilities in Japan? Did the Chinese army drop two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki? To be honest, our level of thinking is more than 108,000 miles beyond such deceptive propaganda! Our idea is not to let people exploit people, let people massacre people, or "let Asians massacre Asians" in order to profit from it (the American Stassen recently said this: "Letting Asians massacre Asians is a shortcut to establishing peace"), we want to develop human wisdom to transform nature and prevent natural violence in order to increase the happiness of people's lives. Look at the facts. The Soviet people are carrying out a large-scale plan to transform nature, turning 120 million hectares of arid land into fertile land, and building 44,000 reservoirs. They are building the world's most magnificent irrigation system, which can irrigate more than 28 million hectares of deserts, semi-deserts, and arid areas. Take our China as an example, we have only been liberated for three years, and the water conservancy projects we have carried out, calculated by the total volume of earthwork, have exceeded 1.2 billion cubic meters. Humanity's horizons should be broadened a little more.

Unfortunately, there is a very old saying in our China called "Greed blinds the mind." Although the saying is very old, the truth is very new. The world is so turbulent today because a very small number of selfish and self-interested people are greedy for excessive profits and have completely blinded their minds. It is a trivial matter that the minds of a few people are blinded, but it is even more unfortunate that a large number of propaganda tools are in their hands, and a large number of killing weapons are also in their hands, so the people of the world have to suffer unprecedented threats and disasters. In broad daylight, blatantly turning black into white, deceiving and coercing people's senses, deception permeates the atmosphere. Such large-scale deception as is being carried out today has really never been seen in human history. In ancient times, Zhao Gao once pointed at a deer and called it a horse, wanting to deceive Qin Ershi alone. But today's Zhao Gaos are constantly pointing at deer and calling them horses, wanting to deceive more than two billion people around the world. Their appetite is huge and their ambition is not small. They want to swallow the whole world and enslave all mankind.

Are people being deceived? Unfortunately, we cannot say no. Recently, I occasionally saw a popular Japanese magazine in July, and saw an article published by an information officer from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who, judging from the photo published in the magazine, was probably less than 30 years old. He doubted what the three Japanese representatives who had participated in the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference had seen and heard in China and the Soviet Union. It is his freedom to doubt, and we do not force him to believe. But that young information officer finally said such a sentence: if Japanese people want to go to China to participate in the peace conference, then "Free Japan will end." This cannot but make me laugh. American officials often boast about what they call the "free world." It is appropriate for the words to come from their mouths. Because they really have "freedom." They have the "freedom" to discriminate against black people in the country, the "freedom" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries abroad, the "freedom" to expand military bases in other countries' territories, the "freedom" to use bacteriological bombs, chemical bombs, and atomic bombs to massacre peaceful residents in large numbers, the "freedom" to arbitrarily trample on international agreements and violate human morality. Their "freedom" is too much to tell. But what kind of "freedom" does the so-called "free Japan" have to speak of? Thinking that the speaker is a young man and specializes in international intelligence, but he said such a thing. This cannot but make us think that the deceptive propaganda of the warmongers still has a market in Japan.

Patriotic Japanese friends, your enthusiasm for striving for freedom and independence and striving for peace and democracy is very inspiring to us, but the obstacles you will encounter are also clearly presented before our eyes like fire. The enemies of peace will not easily allow you to save peace. Recently, we also heard that your Ministry of Foreign Affairs has publicly stated that it has decided not to issue passports to the Japanese people's representatives attending the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, on the pretext that they "cannot guarantee the safety of those Japanese who go to mainland China." This was something we had expected, and the excuse is really laughable and pathetic. Why be so stupid? Doesn't doing so just show that the Japanese government is wholeheartedly pursuing the aggressive policies of the United States and is hostile to peace? Perhaps they also know that it is out of passivity, but under the pressure of the United States, they have to do so. This is the pitiful look of the "appointed governor-general"!

Japanese friends, you know that striving for peace and democracy and striving for freedom and independence should be a long-term and continuous effort. The purpose of our conference is to make this principle clear and to encourage people to make this effort constant. The greatest weapon of the enemies of peace is deception, and our efforts should be to clarify the truth as much as possible and expose their deceptive propaganda. The greatest reliance of the enemies of peace is those who have been deceived, and our efforts should be to try our best to remove those deceptions, win over a wide range of people, so that they can realize their own strength and distinguish between enemies and friends. Exposing deceptive propaganda and winning over the broad masses is not a task that can be completed by one or two meetings. This requires us to use our indomitable spirit and take advantage of various opportunities to work among the masses constantly in order to gradually achieve our goals. The actual work is not at the meeting, the actual work is among the masses. Therefore, patriotic Japanese friends, we warmly welcome your peace representatives if they can come to Beijing victoriously. We believe that the representatives of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions will also warmly welcome you. We hope that you will use your greatest efforts and rely on the strength of the people to strive for such victory in many ways. But if you are hindered and cannot obtain passports or visas, and ultimately cannot come, although it is a pity, you have already won in the first round of the struggle for peace. Because you have rooted the peace movement among the people of Japan and further exposed the truth about the enemies of peace. Peace representatives need passports, but the peace movement does not need passports. Although the enemies of peace can prevent representatives from going to Beijing, they cannot prevent the demand for peace from circulating around the world like the atmosphere. Therefore, even if your representatives cannot come, our conference will still be held, and your spirit can still be expressed at the conference. The support of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions for you will not change, but will rather redouble their efforts to support your struggle. Let us constantly expand, deepen, persist, and strengthen the struggle for peace, and victory will surely belong to the people!

Let me extend my peaceful greetings to you on behalf of the Chinese people!

### 为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开第二次给日本人民一封公开信
郭沫若

专栏：

    为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开第二次给日本人民一封公开信
    郭沫若日本的工人、农民、青年学生、进步的知识分子和其他一切爱国的朋友们：
    去年九月，旧金山片面“对日和约”签订的前夜，我曾经写过一封信给你们，我曾接受到你们友谊的反应，谨向你们致谢。很快就满一周年了，现在又临到亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将要召开的前夜，我感觉着不能不再写一封信给你们，表示我们中国人民和我自己对于你们的系念。
    旧金山片面“对日和约”和所谓“日美双边安全条约”缔结以后，本年二月二十八日美国政府和你们的吉田政府又缔结了美日“行政协定”。规定了美国在日本长期驻兵，拥有大量的军事基地并享受治外法权的这些“条约”和“协定”竟在四月二十八日被宣布“生效”。而在同一天，在美国操纵之下，你们的吉田政府和台湾国民党也签定了所谓“日华和约”。
    根据一年来的发展情势看来，你们的祖国在代表美国利益的吉田政府管制之下，是愈来愈深入地为执行美国的侵略政策而走上重新军国主义化的道路了。最近我们又看到七月二十六日美国政府与吉田政府之间的“设施与区域协定”的签订，这更规定得很明白：日本必须向美国占领军继续提供营房、海陆空军演习场、飞机场、海军基地等所谓“一般设施”六百零三处——其中无限期占用者三百处，所谓暂时使用者三百零三处。这些“设施和区域”，包括着飞机场十一处、辅助空军基地十八处、兵营三十一处、地面部队演习场三十二处、海军基地两处、大住宅区十八处。在这之外，还有一些关于“通讯设施”和“民间情报部”等属于军事机密的秘密协定，没有宣布。看这情形，我在前信中说过“日本今天的命运，无可讳言，已同于我们中国未解放前的命运”，是一点也没有夸大了。
    日本人民，在过去被占领的六年间，已经负担了四十九亿七千万美元的军事占领费。在获得所谓“独立”以来，日本政府执行重新军国主义化的政策，使日本今年的预算比去年又增加了百分之三十，直接和间接军费达到预算总额百分之七十。因此，使得日本人民的生活愈见困难，听说每人每日食物所含的热量比起标准数来已减少了百分之六十。和平工业遭受着极大的摧残，已经有六千七百多家中小企业被迫破产了。
    在这样的情形之下，你们的吉田茂首相却表达了他的伟大的抱负。据说“美国希望领导亚洲的是日本”，他表示决心要“回答美国的希望”。这是他在八月四日对日本的变相军部——“保安厅”总部的首领们演说时所说的话。原来吉田茂先生是奉了美国之命，要来做“亚洲总管”的，抱负真是不凡呵！可是，遗憾得很，亚洲人是不是需要这样的一个“总管”，我们还不得而知。即使需要，但总不能由任何豪杰来自封，或由美国政府来钦赐的吧。
    前几年在帝国主义日本刚开始投降的时间，我对日本政客、财阀和军阀的残余分子曾经作过这样的估计，以为他们要学习卧薪尝胆的越王勾践。这估计，我现在知道是错了。他们原来只是想学习卖国求荣的蒋匪介石而已。吉田茂要和蒋介石订立“日华和约”，正是恰如其分。所谓“方以类聚，物以群分”，傀儡自当归纳进同一的窗橱里面啦，可不是吗？
    爱国的日本朋友们，你们在这样双重的压迫下边，你们在精神上和物质上所受的遭遇是怎样，我们很能够了解。我们中国的成年人曾经是在这种屈辱悲愤的遭遇中长大的，我们从这种遭遇中解放出来还只有几年光景。而我们的台湾同胞们事实上还陷在这种遭遇里面，如水益深、如火益热的。要怎样才能解脱这样的遭遇呢？根据我们自己的经验，我们认识得很清楚，是要团结人民作长期的爱国斗争。因此，我们对于你们近年来争取独立、自由、和平、民主的爱国行动，特别是反对日本的重新军国主义化（事实上是美国殖民地化）的努力，是怀抱着深厚的敬意的。不仅我们中国人民是这样，全世界爱好和平正义的人民都是这样。今年七月初旬，世界和平理事会在柏林召开了一次特别会议，五十九个国家的二四○位理事和特邀代表所一致举手通过的“关于反对日本重新军国主义化而争取建立民主日本的决议”正竭诚地在向你们高呼。请让我把那“决议”中的最后两节抄录一遍吧：
    “世界和平理事会对日本人民争取和平、独立与民主、反对军国主义势力和战争势力的英勇斗争表示敬意。世界和平理事会并呼吁亚洲和太平洋所有其他各国人民尽最大的力量支持这个斗争。这样，他们就可以保障他们自己的和平与民主的发展。世界和平理事会进一步呼吁那些在曾签字于旧金山条约的政府之下的各国爱好和平的人民，为另行签订一个真正的和约而斗争。
    为了达到这个目的，世界和平理事会号召亚洲和太平洋各国人民尽最大的力量，为将于一九五二年秋季在北京举行的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，把和平民主力量动员起来。这个会议对于圆满地解决日本以及亚洲及太平洋其他各国所面临的问题是有帮助的。”这决议是正确的，很符合爱好和平的世界人民的意志。中国人民、亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民都愿接受这个热忱的号召，并已早有共同的决心，准备用更大的力量来支持你们了。你们是知道的，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，正是这种共同决心的最具体的表现。这个区域和平会议所要讨论的范围，诚如筹备会议的提议所指示，将有四大项目，但毫无疑问，有关日本问题的讨论必然成为会议的中心任务。因为亚洲及太平洋区域能否维持和平，与日本的是否重新军国主义化和日本人民能否获得自由民主的生活，有不可分割的关系。反对日本的重新军国主义化是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的共同要求，也是爱国的日本人民的要求。使日本人民争取到自由民主的生活，是爱国的日本人民的愿望，也是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的共同愿望。这是一个艰剧的斗争，而爱国的日本人民是不能不站在这斗争的最前线的。今年五一节的大游行，爱国的日本人民已经表示了英勇不屈的气概。在暴力弹压中因伤致死的工会会员高桥正雄的话和他母亲的话打动着世界人民的心弦。高桥正雄的母亲在东京母亲会的成立大会上说：“我从我儿子的衣包里搜到了一通申请书，写着‘要自由、要和平、要有人的生活’；作为他的母亲，我要实现我儿子的愿望。”读了这话的人，谁能不受感动呢？这只是千千万万日本母亲中的一例而已。毫无疑问，亚洲及太平洋区域爱好和平与正义的人民都将以最大的力量来支持日本人民的斗争；因为，他们确切地知道，支持日本人民也就是保障自己的和平与民主的发展。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，自六月初旬召开了筹备会议以来，在两三个月的期间，在各国的筹备工作进行得很顺畅，已经有了很好的展开。在前不曾取得联系的国家，嗣后已取得了很好的联系，如像寮国、尼泊尔、巴拿马、秘鲁，都已决定派代表参加。各国的反映都很热烈，有好些国家的代表都已在来中国的途中了。就中，爱国的日本人民对于筹备工作的猛进，是使我们十分感奋的。我们热诚地欢迎日本的人民代表能够胜利地来到北京。
    我们这一次的会议是人民代表会议，目的是正大光明的。我们的目的就是要拯救和平。我们要求日本民主化、反对日本的重新军国主义化；要求普遍裁军、反对使用大量杀人的原子能、细菌、化学武器；要求恢复正常的贸易关系与文化交流，反对封锁禁运；要求朝鲜及东南亚各国的问题迅速地得到和平解决，反对以暴力干涉别人内政。这些目的是正大光明的，不仅是亚洲及太平洋区域人民的愿望，也是全世界爱好和平正义的人民的共同愿望。我们希望不同制度的国家和平共处，决不侵略别人，也决不受别人侵略；在平等互利的基础之上有无相助，促进彼此的和平建设来提高人民福利，求得共同发展。这是正大光明的，凡是理智清明的人都是不能反对的。
    日本的朋友们，你们想来是记得的，与亚洲及太平洋有关的国际集合，最近也曾有过一些这样的会议。七月二十八日在华盛顿曾经开过一次美、英、法、加拿大和日本参加的五国会议，它的中心议题是讨论远东的贸易问题，特别要限制日本的工商界与中华人民共和国进行贸易，想使日本把输出的方向转向东南亚各国。这是什么意义呢？明白地说吧，这并不是在封锁我们，而是在封锁日本，而是要使日本和英国在东南亚发生冲突。这样的会议，岂不是一个钩心斗角、同床异梦的会议吗？八月四日至六日在檀香山也开过一次所谓“美澳新理事会”第一次会议，准备把美国、澳大利亚、新西兰之间的所谓“三国安全条约”扩大成为“太平洋公约”，把日本也拖进去，把“由白令海峡经阿留申群岛、日本、台湾、菲律宾、澳大利亚到新西兰”作为军事范围，而以朝鲜为一个前哨。这是什么意义呢？据说是“防范共产主义的侵略”。然而英国也被排除在这座海上的“万里长城”之外了。
    我们的会议不同于这样的一些会议。不，我们是正相反对的。我们要的不是侵略，我们要的是和平。我们要的不是封锁禁运、独占垄断，我们要的是公平交易、平等互利。我们不是尔诈我虞、纵横捭阖；我们是光明正大、开诚布公。我们不是煽动仇恨，想以武力来解决问题；我们是主张相互了解，以协商精神代替武力解决。这一对比，凡是理智清明的人都应该是很清楚的。
    什么叫“防范共产主义的侵略”呵？谁不知道那不外是“贼喊捉贼”的老调门吗？希特勒、墨索里尼和东条英机在生的当年也天天都在唱着这样的调子。然而发动了大规模的侵略战争，使世界人民（德意志人民、意大利人民、日本人民都包含在内）有好些一直到今天都还没有从战争的创伤中恢复转来的，到底是谁呢？毫无疑问，苏联是共产主义国家；我们中国也是坚决地要在将来走向共产主义建设的道路的，但我们究竟“侵略”了谁？是苏联在日本拥有六百零三处军事设施吗？是中国的军队在广岛和长崎投下了两枚原子弹吗？老实说，我们的思想水平，和这样的欺骗宣传比较起来，已经超越到不只十万八千里了！我们的想法不是让人来剥削人，让人来屠杀人，或者是“让亚洲人来屠杀亚洲人”以便从中取利（美国的史塔生最近说过这样的话：“让亚洲人屠杀亚洲人是建立和平的捷径”），我们是要发展人类的智慧来改造自然，防范自然的暴力，以增进人民生活的幸福。请看事实好了。苏联人民在进行着大规模的改造自然的计划，使一亿二千万公顷干旱的土地变成沃壤，要建设四万四千个蓄水池。他们在建立着世界上最宏大的灌溉体系，可以灌溉两千八百万公顷以上的沙漠，半沙漠和干旱地区。再拿我们中国来说吧，我们解放仅仅三年，所进行的水利工程，以土方总量来计算，已经超过了十二亿立方公尺。人类的眼界是应该放得更加宽阔
    一些的时候了。
    然而不幸得很，我们中国有一句很古的话叫作“利令智昏”。话虽很古，道理却是很新。今天的世界弄得十分动荡，就是由于有极少数的自私自利分子贪得超额利润，把理智完全弄昏迷了。少数人的理智昏迷倒是小事，而更不幸的却有大量的宣传工具掌握在他们手里，也有大量的杀人武器掌握在他们手里，世界人民就不得不遭受空前未有的威胁和灾害了。在青天白日之中，明目张胆地倒黑为白，欺骗逼迫着人的感官，欺骗弥漫着大气，像今天所进行着的这样大规模的欺骗，人类自有历史以来实在还不曾见过。古时有个赵高曾经有一次指鹿为马，是想欺骗秦二世一个人。而今天的赵高们，经常在指鹿为马，是想欺骗全世界二十亿以上的人民大众。他们的胃口很大、野心不小，要吞咽全世界，要奴役全人类。
    人们是不是有的受了蒙蔽呢？遗憾，我们不能说没有。最近我偶尔看到一本七月份的日本的通俗杂志，看到有一位外务省情报人员，照那杂志所登的相片看来怕还不到三十岁光景，发表了一篇文章。他怀疑参加过亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的三位日本代表在中国和苏联的所见所闻。谁要怀疑，是他的自由，我们并不勉强他相信。但那位青年情报人员最后却说出了这样一句话，日本人如要到中国去参加和平会议，那吗“自由日本便终焉了”。这就不能不使我失笑了。美国的官员们经常在夸说什么“自由世界”。话出自他们口里，倒还合乎身分。因为他们究竟有的是“自由”。他们有在国内歧视黑种人的“自由”，有在国外干涉别人内政的“自由”，有在别人的国境内扩充军事基地的“自由”，有使用细菌弹、化学弹、原子弹大量屠杀和平居民的“自由”，有任意蹂躏国际协定、违背人类道义的“自由”，他们的“自由”之多实在是说不尽。但所谓“自由日本”，究竟有什么的“自由”可言呢？想到说话者是青年、是专门搞国际情报的，然而竟说出这样的话。这就不能不使我们想到，好战者的欺骗宣传，在日本是还有市场的。
    爱国的日本朋友们，你们争取自由独立、争取和平民主的热情使我们十分感奋，但你们所将遭遇到的阻碍也明白如火地呈现在我们的眼前。和平的敌人们不会轻易地容许你们来拯救和平。最近我们又听说，你们的外务省已公开声称决定不发护照给你们出席亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的日本人民代表，藉口是他们“不能保证那些赴中国大陆的日本人的安全”。这倒是早在我们预料中的事，而藉口也实在是可笑可怜得很。为什么要那样愚蠢呢？那样做，岂不是正好表明了日本政府是死心踏地奉行着美国的侵略政策而敌视和平的吗？或许也明知道是出于被动吧，然而在美国压力之下又不能不那样做。这就是“钦赐总管”的可怜相呵！
    日本朋友们，你们是知道的，争取和平民主，争取自由独立，应该是一种长期性的不断的努力。我们的会议的目的就是要把这道理说清楚，要鼓励人们把这种努力经常化。和平的敌人最大的武器是欺骗，我们的努力就要多多阐明真相，揭穿它的欺骗宣传。和平的敌人最大的凭借是那些受了蒙蔽的人们，我们的努力就要尽力除去那些蒙蔽，争取广泛的人民，使他们认识到自己的力量，分清敌友。揭露欺骗宣传，争取广大群众，这不是一次两次的会议所能完成的任务。这要靠我们以坚忍不挠的精神，利用各种机会，经常在群众中做工作，才能够逐渐地达到目的。实际的工作不是在会议上，实际的工作是在群众中。因此，爱国的日本朋友们，你们的和平代表如能胜利地到北京来，我们是热烈地欢迎的。我们相信，亚洲及太平洋区域的各国代表也都会热烈地欢迎你们。我们希望你们用最大的努力，靠人民的力量来多方争取到这样的胜利。但你们万一受到阻碍，得不到护照或签证，终竟不能够到来，虽然是遗憾的事，但你们在和平斗争的第一回合上是已经胜利了。因为你们使和平运动在日本的人民大众中生了根，而把和平敌人的真相更进一步揭露了。和平代表要护照，和平运动是不要护照的。和平的敌人虽然能够阻止代表们到北京，但不能阻止和平的要求像大气一样在全世界上环流。因此，万一你们的代表不能来，我们的会议依然要召开，你们的精神依然有方法在大会上表达。亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民对于你们的支持是不会改变的，无宁会要以加倍的努力来声援你们的斗争。使争取和平的斗争不断地扩大，深入、持久、加强吧，胜利是必然属于人民的！
    让我代表中国人民向你们致和平的敬礼！
    一九五二年九月五日
