Xinhua News Agency, September 26th:

    Five Chinese people's organizations donated 2 billion RMB (equivalent to 421,940 rupees) to the Indian government to relieve the famine in the Andhra region of India, hoping that the funds would be distributed in the Andhra region. The relevant Indian government departments have now replied, accepting the funds and expressing their gratitude. The five Chinese people's organizations are the Red Cross Society of China, the China People's Relief Association, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation.
    The Andhra region of India suffered a major famine this year. The Andhra Region Joint Relief Committee sent a letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stating that the disaster situation in the region was extremely serious, and the broad masses of people were in a terrible famine disaster, and requested assistance from the Chinese people. The Chinese and Indian people have a long and close friendship; at the same time, the Chinese people have suffered from various disasters in the past, so they deeply sympathize with and are concerned about the plight of the victims in the Andhra region. The above-mentioned five Chinese people's organizations specially remitted 2 billion RMB to the Indian Red Cross Society on August 9th, requesting the society to transfer the donation to the Andhra Region Joint Relief Committee. On August 21st, the Indian Red Cross Society replied by telegram stating that the society could not directly transfer the donation to any organization. Considering the severity of the disaster in the Andhra region of India, and considering that the Indian government has expressed its willingness to consult with the donating organizations on the distribution of the donation, the five Chinese people's organizations decided to hand over all the funds to the Indian government, and hoped that the donation would be distributed in the Andhra region. The relevant Indian government departments have now replied, accepting the funds, expressing gratitude to the five Chinese people's organizations, and stating that they have taken note of the donors' wishes to have the funds distributed in the Andhra region.

    我国五人民团体捐款二十亿元
    救济印度安得拉区饥荒
    【新华社二十六日讯】我国五个人民团体为救济印度安得拉区饥荒，曾以人民币二十亿元（折合四十二万一千九百四十卢比）汇交印度政府，希望将该款在安得拉区发放。印度政府有关方面现已复信接受该款，并表示感谢。我国五个人民团体是中国红十字会、中国人民救济总会、中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合总会和中华全国民主妇女联合会。
    印度安得拉区今年曾遇到大灾荒，安得拉区联合赈济委员会曾致函中华全国总工会称，该区灾情极为严重，广大人民正处在可怕的饥荒灾难中，并要求中国人民给予援助。中国人民与印度人民之间有着悠久密切的友谊；同时，中国人民过去曾身受各种灾害之侵袭，因此对安得拉区灾民的处境深为同情与关切。上述中国五个人民团体特于八月九日联合汇出人民币二十亿元给印度红十字会，请该会把捐款转交给安得拉区联合赈济委员会。八月二十一日，印度红十字会复电称，该会不能将捐款直接转交给任何团体。中国五个人民团体鉴于印度安得拉区的灾情严重，并鉴于印度政府表示愿意与捐赠团体协商捐款的分配办法，当决定将全部款项交给印度政府，并希望将该项捐款在安得拉区发放。印度政府有关方面现已复信接受该款，对中国五个人民团体表示感谢，并表示对捐款者愿将该款在安得拉区发放一事，已予注意。
