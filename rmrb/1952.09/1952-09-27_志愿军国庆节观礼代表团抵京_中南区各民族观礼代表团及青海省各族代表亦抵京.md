Vice Chairman Chen Shutong delivered a welcome speech to the representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army National Day Observation Delegation, saying: The great strength you have shown on the Korean battlefield has not only guaranteed the smooth progress of the various reforms and construction work in the motherland, but also greatly strengthened the confidence and determination of the people of the world to defend peace. The people of the whole country are sincerely grateful to you and are determined to work harder to support you.

All these shameless tricks of the enemy have aroused the infinite anger of all comrades in our Volunteer Army. We stand firmly at our combat posts, constantly annihilating a large number of enemies, and dedicating new combat victories as our gift to celebrate National Day!
