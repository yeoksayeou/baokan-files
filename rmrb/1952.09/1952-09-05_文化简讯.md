    Tianjin Student Summer Life Guidance Committee Invites Writers Ding Ling and Others to Report on Literary Reading and Writing Issues
    In order to improve students' reading and writing abilities, the Tianjin Student Summer Life Guidance Committee invited Zhou Libo and Ding Ling to give reports on writing issues in July and August, and Yuan Shuipai to give a report on how to study "Zoya and Shura's Story". In his report, Zhou Libo used his own experiences to illustrate the importance of ideological transformation for intellectuals from petty-bourgeois origins in literary creation. He said that he had lived in Yan'an for many years, but because his thoughts and feelings had not fundamentally changed, he could not correctly view new things, wrote very little, and the works he wrote were incompatible with the thoughts and feelings of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. After the rectification and study in 1942, he responded to Chairman Mao's call to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, consciously transform his thinking, and wrote the work "The Hurricane" reflecting the land reform movement. He said that to make one's thoughts and feelings consistent with those of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must live with them, learn from them, and undergo long-term hard training to become a member of the masses. He said that any writer who is detached from the masses cannot write good works.

    In her report, Ding Ling used many vivid examples to illustrate how to train oneself to have a correct view of things and how to create good literary works. She said that to have a correct view of things, one must first correct one's position and stand on the position of the people. If one's personal thoughts and feelings do not meet the requirements of the people, then one will not be able to see everything accurately. To discover new things, one should first put one's feelings on the side of the newborn, and love the people and the people's cause. She said that there is no shortcut to becoming a writer. One must rely on one's own day-to-day efforts, be willing to learn, be willing to study, and have drive. She advised the students to learn to write, not to write poetry or novels first, but to write essays first, to lay a good foundation for sketching. She told everyone not to mistakenly believe that all enterprising spirit is personal heroism. She called on everyone to aim for the highest standards, have lofty ideals, but have a down-to-earth attitude towards learning in order to achieve something.

    In his report, Yuan Shuipai analyzed the era in which Zoya grew up to illustrate the significance of studying "Zoya and Shura's Story" today. He said that the youth of the new China, who bear major responsibilities of the times, should learn Zoya's high degree of patriotism and internationalism, and correctly handle the relationship between collective interests and personal interests. We must learn from Zoya's high degree of principle in dealing with people and affairs, and also learn from her serious attitude towards learning and work. He said that learning from Zoya is not a formal imitation of some of her behaviors, but to learn her spiritual essence, and to start from everyday trivial matters. In the report, Yuan Shuipai also emphasized that Zoya was not a born hero. She has such good qualities, on the one hand, it is the result of the education and training of the Party, Soviet society, schools, and families, and on the other hand, it is also the result of her conscious efforts. He also encouraged the students to learn from Zoya, not to regard Zoya as very mysterious, and think that they are too bad to learn. He said that in our country, countless model youths such as Liu Hulan, Ding Youjun, and Luo Shengjiao have also emerged. The youth should take them as examples to learn from.

    In addition, the association invited Jiang Feng to report on art issues.

    天津市学生暑期生活指导委员会邀请作家丁玲等报告文艺阅读和写作问题
    天津市学生暑期生活指导委员会为了提高同学们的阅读和写作能力，曾经在七、八两月先后邀请周立波、丁玲作有关写作问题的报告，邀请袁水拍作关于怎样学习“卓娅与舒拉的故事”的报告。周立波在报告中用自己的经历来说明小资产阶级出身的知识分子的思想改造对于文艺创作的重要性。他说，他曾在延安生活多年，由于思想感情没有根本变化，不能正确地看待新鲜事物，写作很少，写出的作品也是和工农兵群众的思想感情格格不入的。经过一九四二年的整风学习，他响应了毛主席的号召，深入工农兵生活，有意识地改造自己的思想，就写出了反映土地改革运动的作品“暴风骤雨”。他说，要使自己的思想感情与工农兵取得一致，必须和他们生活在一起，向他们学习，经过长期的艰苦锻炼，使自己成为群众中的一员。他说，任何脱离群众的作家是写不出好的作品的。
    丁玲在报告中用许多生动的例子来说明怎样锻炼自己，使自己具有对事物的正确看法，怎样才能创作好的文艺作品等等问题。她说，要使自己具有对事物的正确看法，首先要端正自己的立场，站在人民大众的立场上，如果个人的思想感情不符合人民的要求，那么看一切事物都将是不准确的。要发见新事物，首先应当把感情放在新生的方面，要热爱人民、热爱人民的事业。她说，当作家是没有捷径可走的，必须依靠自己一天一天的努力，肯学习，肯钻研，有干劲。她劝告同学们学习写作，不要先写诗或小说，可先写散文，把素描的基础打好。她叫大家不要误以为一切进取心都是个人英雄主义，她号召大家向最高的标准看齐，要有远大理想，但要有老老实实的学习态度，才能有所成就。
    袁水拍在报告中分析了卓娅生长的时代背景，来说明我们今天学习“卓娅与舒拉的故事”的意义。他说，负有重大的时代责任的新中国的青年，应该学习卓娅高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，正确地处理集体利益和个人利益的关系。我们要学习卓娅处人处事的高度的原则性，也要学习她认真的学习态度和工作态度。他说，学习卓娅，不是对她的某一些行为作形式上的摹仿，而是要学习她的精神实质，并且要从日常小事做起。报告中袁水拍还着重地指出卓娅不是天生的英雄。她有这样好的品质，一方面是党和苏联社会、学校和家庭的教育培养成功的，一方面也是她自觉的努力的结果。他并且鼓励同学们向卓娅学习，不要把卓娅看得很神秘，认为自己太差，学不到。他说在我们国家里，也产生了像刘胡兰、丁佑君、罗盛教等无数模范青年，青年们应该把他们作为学习的榜样。
    此外，该会曾邀请江丰报告美术问题。
