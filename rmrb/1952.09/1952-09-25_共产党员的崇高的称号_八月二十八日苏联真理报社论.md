The entire history and heroic journey of the Communist Party is a model of selfless service to the cause of the working class and all working people. The Soviet people regard the Communist Party as their tested leader, and the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our era. The Communist Party is the organizing and guiding force of Soviet society, and its policies are the lifeblood of the Soviet system.

The party of Lenin and Stalin organized the alliance of the working class and the working peasants, overthrew the regime of capitalists and landlords through the October Revolution of 1917, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, eliminated capitalism, eradicated exploitation of man by man, and ensured the establishment of a socialist society.

"Now," states the draft revision of the Party Constitution, "the main task of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is to build a communist society through the gradual transition from socialism to communism, to gradually improve the material and cultural standards of society, to educate members of society with the spirit of internationalism and fraternal ties with the working people of all countries, and to extremely strengthen the active defense of the socialist motherland against the aggressive actions of its enemies."

The Communist Party has achieved and continues to achieve victories because it is closely linked to the millions of working masses, and it is a union of unified will, unified action, and unified discipline. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is a voluntary combat alliance composed of like-minded communists from the working class, working peasants, and working intellectuals.

The organizers and leaders of the Party, Lenin and Stalin, consistently demonstrated great concern for the consolidation of the Party. Lenin said: "We must strive to elevate the title and significance of Party members higher, higher, and ever higher..."

Communist Party members are the vanguard of our era, dedicating all their strength, knowledge, and enthusiasm to the struggle for the happiness of the working people and the cause of communism. At all times and in all places, they set an example of unwavering spirit and heroism in overcoming difficulties and achieving set goals.

"We communists," Comrade Stalin said at the Second All-Union Congress of Soviets in January 1924, "are people of a special kind. We are made of special material. The army of the great proletarian strategist, the army of Comrade Lenin, is organized by people like us. To be a member of this army is the most glorious thing. The title of member of the party founded and led by Comrade Lenin is the noblest thing."

The new tasks facing our Party in the construction of a communist society require Party members to increase their sense of responsibility to the cause of the Party. The draft revision of the Party Constitution stipulates the obligations of Party members. The discussion of the Central Committee's documents on the congress, which has begun in Party organizations, shows that the broad masses of Party members unanimously approve the obligations and rights of Party members stipulated in the draft revision of the Party Constitution.

The first obligation of a Party member, as emphasized in the draft revision of the Party Constitution, is to do everything possible to safeguard the unity of the Party, which is the main condition for the Party's strength and power. Party members should be active fighters in implementing the Party's resolutions. For a communist, it is not enough to merely agree with the Party's resolutions. His task is to actively struggle for the realization of these resolutions. A communist who adopts a passive or hypocritical attitude towards the Party's resolutions will inevitably weaken the Party's combat effectiveness, and therefore, this is incompatible with the identity of a Party member.

The obligation of a communist – regardless of his position – is to always play an exemplary role in labor, master his professional skills, and constantly improve his production skills. In industrial enterprises, in collective farms, in government offices – wherever a communist is, he should set an example of a communist attitude towards labor, become the initiator and promoter of all new and advanced things, which will unleash the creative initiative of the masses and promote the further development of socialist competition. The task of a communist is to inspire the masses with his personal example to establish new labor achievements for the benefit of the Soviet motherland.

The lofty title of Party member requires communists to constantly strengthen ties with the masses, promptly reflect the demands and needs of the working people, explain the Party's policies and resolutions to non-Party members, and always remember that the Party's strength and invincibility lies in its inseparable connection with the people.

"The connection with the masses," Comrade Stalin said, "the strengthening of this connection and the readiness to listen to the opinions of the masses – this is where the strength and invincibility of Bolshevik leadership lies."

All of our Party's activities are guided by the invincible theory of Marxism-Leninism. The Party requires every communist to strive to raise his awareness and master the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

To be a communist – is to uphold the interests of the Party and the state in any matter, big or small, and to abide by the discipline of the Party and the state, which is equally binding on all members. Our Party has only one discipline, one law, for all members, regardless of their merits or positions. Violating the discipline of the Party and the state, as pointed out in the draft revision of the Party Constitution, is incompatible with the identity of a Party member.

Loyalty and honesty to the Party are indispensable qualities of a communist. A communist has no right to conceal the truth from the Party about any aspect of Party, state, or economic work. The Party cannot tolerate the existence of those who deceive the Party in its ranks, because such people will shake people's trust in the Party and undermine the Party's ranks spiritually.

The Party has cultivated numerous cadres who can faithfully implement the instructions of the Party and the state, and who regard the implementation of these instructions not as an empty formality, but as an honorable undertaking, an undertaking of a high task they have undertaken for the Party. However, it must be admitted that there is a major evil in many Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, which is the incorrect method of selecting cadres. The draft revision of the Party Constitution includes a requirement for communist party members: in any position entrusted by the Party, resolutely implement the Party's instructions on the correct selection of cadres according to political quality and professional ability. All acts that violate this instruction and select personnel according to friendship, personal favor, hometown ties, and kinship are incompatible with the identity of a Party member.

Our Party is strong because it is not afraid of criticism and draws strength for further progress from criticism of its own shortcomings. Unfortunately, there are still some communists who constantly profess loyalty to the Party, but in reality, they do not allow criticism from below and stifle criticism. Comrade Stalin said that we should wage a relentless struggle against the suppression of self-criticism and the persecution of self-criticism.

The draft revision of the Party Constitution states that Party members must carry out self-criticism and criticism from below, expose shortcomings in work and strive to eliminate them, oppose arrogance and complacency, and oppose being carried away by achievements in work. Those who stifle criticism and replace criticism with empty talk and flattery cannot remain in the Party ranks.

The high political vigilance of communists, and the unwavering struggle against all conspiracies of the enemy, are the most important conditions for further consolidating our Party and the Soviet state. However, it cannot be ignored that expressions of political indifference and carelessness, and incidents of leaking Party and state secrets, still exist quite widely among communists. Every communist must maintain political vigilance at all times and under all circumstances. Party members must keep Party and state secrets.

While Party members undertake high and important tasks, they are also given great rights. The draft revision of the Party Constitution states that Party members have the right to participate in free and earnest discussions on Party policy issues at Party meetings or in Party publications, to criticize any worker at Party meetings, to elect and be elected to Party organs, to require personal participation when resolutions are passed regarding their activities or conduct, and to raise any issues and statements to any Party organ, up to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The preparations for the Nineteenth Party Congress fully demonstrate the love and support of our people for our Communist Party. The Soviet people express their willingness to devote all their strength to the great cause of communist construction under the tested leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin.

    共产党员的崇高的称号
    ——八月二十八日苏联真理报社论
    共产党的全部历史、全部英勇的路程是忘我地服务于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的事业的典范。苏联人民把共产党看作自己的经过考验的领袖和我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。共产党是苏维埃社会的组织和指导力量，它的政策是苏维埃制度的生命基础。
    列宁、斯大林的党组织了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟，经过一九一七年十月革命，推翻了资本家和地主的政权，建立了无产阶级专政，肃清了资本主义，消灭了人对人的剥削并保证了社会主义社会的建立。
    “现在，——党章修正草案中说，——苏联共产党的主要任务是：通过由社会主义逐渐过渡到共产主义的途径来建立共产主义社会，逐步提高社会的物质和文化水平，用国际主义及与各国劳动人民建立兄弟联系的精神来教育社会成员，极度加强社会主义祖国对其敌人侵略行动的积极防御。”
    共产党过去和现在所以能够取得胜利，是因为它紧密联系着千百万劳动群众，它是意志统一、行动统一和纪律统一的结合体。苏联共产党是工人阶级、劳动农民和劳动知识分子中思想一致的共产主义者所组成的自愿的战斗联盟。
    党的组织者和领袖列宁和斯大林对党的巩固经常地表现着巨大的关怀。列宁说：“我们应当努力把党员的称号和意义提得高些，高些再高些……。”
    共产党员，是我们时代的先进者，为争取劳动人民的幸福和共产主义的斗争事业而付出自己的全部力量、知识和热情。在一切时候和一切地方，他们都树立着克服困难、达到既定目标的坚毅精神和英勇气概的榜样。
    “我们共产党人，——斯大林同志于一九二四年一月在第二届全苏苏维埃代表大会上说，——是特种式样的人。我们是由特别材料制成的。伟大无产阶级战略家的军队，列宁同志的军队就是由我们这些人组织的。在这个军队里做一个队员，是再光荣不过的了。以列宁同志为创始人和领导者的党的党员称号，是再高尚不过的了。”
    我党在共产主义社会建设中所面临的新任务，要求党员提高对党的事业的责任心。党章修正草案中规定了党员的义务。在党的组织中已开始的对联共（布）党中央委员会的关于代表大会文件的讨论表明：广大党员群众一致赞同党章修正草案中所规定的党员的义务和权利。
    党员的首先一项义务，——党章修正草案强调指出，——是尽力护卫党的统一，这是党之所以有力量和强大的主要条件。党员应当是执行党的决议的积极战士。对于共产党员来说，仅仅同意党的决议是不够的。他的任务是为实现这些决议而积极奋斗。共产党员对党的决议采取消极的阳奉阴违的态度，就必然会削弱党的战斗力，因此，这是与党员的身份不相容的。
    共产党员的义务——不管他在什么工作岗位上——是要时时在劳动中起模范作用，掌握自己的业务技术，不断提高自己的生产技能。在工业企业中，在集体农庄中，在机关里——一个共产党员在任何地方，他都应当树立共产主义的劳动态度的榜样，成为一切新的和先进的事物的首创者和宣传者，这些新的和先进的事物将发挥群众的创造的主动性，促进社会主义竞赛进一步开展。共产党员的任务是要以个人的榜样鼓舞群众为苏维埃祖国的福利而建立新的劳动功勋。
    党员的崇高的称号要求共产党员必须经常加强与群众的联系，及时反映劳动人民的要求和需要，向非党群众解释党的政策和决议，时时记住我党之所以有力量和不可战胜，就在于它和人民有着不可分割的血肉联系。
    “和群众的联系，——斯大林同志说，——这种联系的加强和随时准备倾听群众的意见，——布尔什维克的领导之所以有力量和不可战胜就在于此。”
    我党的全部活动都受着无往而不胜的马克思列宁主义理论的指导。党要求每个共产党员，必须努力提高自己的觉悟，精通马克思列宁主义的原理。
    作一个共产党员——就是要在任何大小事情上坚持党和国家的利益，遵守党和国家的纪律，这种纪律是一切党员都必须同样遵守的。我们的党对于一切党员，不管他的功绩和职位如何，只有一个纪律、一个法律。破坏党和国家的纪律，如党章修正草案中指出的，是与党员的身份不相容的。
    对党忠诚老实是共产党员的不可缺少的品质。共产党员没有权利对党隐瞒党、国家和经济工作任何部门的事情的真相。党不能容许它的队伍中有欺骗党的人存在，因为这种人会动摇人们对党的信任，在精神上瓦解党的队伍。
    党培养了众多的能够忠诚地执行党和国家的指示的干部，他们认为执行这些指示不是空洞的形式，而是荣誉的事业，自己对党所承担的高度任务的事业。然而，必须承认，在党的、苏维埃的和经济的许多组织中，有一种重大的恶行，就是用不正确的方法选拔干部。在党章修正草案中包括着一项对共产党员的要求：在党所付托的任何岗位上，坚决执行党关于按照政治品质和业务能力正确选拔干部的指示。凡是破坏这种指示，按照朋友关系、私人情面、同乡和亲戚关系选拔工作人员的行为，都是与党员的身份不相容的。
    我们党之所以有力量，就在于它不害怕批评，并且从对自己的缺点的批评中，吸取进一步前进运动的力量。可惜，我们还有些共产党员，他们不断在嘴里说忠实于党，而实际上却不许下面批评并窒息批评。斯大林同志说，应当对压制自我批评和追究自我批评的事情进行无情的斗争。
    党章修正草案中说，党员必须展开自我批评和自下而上的批评，揭露工作中的缺点并努力加以消灭，反对骄傲自满，反对因为工作中的成绩而冲昏头脑。凡是窒息批评而以夸夸其谈、阿谀奉承代替批评的人，都不能留在党的队伍里。
    共产党员的高度政治警惕性，为反对敌人的一切阴谋而进行不调和的斗争，是进一步巩固我党和苏维埃国家的最重要条件。然而，不可忽视的是，政治上漠不关心和吊儿浪当的表现，泄露党和国家的机密的事件，在共产党员中间还相当广泛地存在着。每一个共产党员在任何时候、任何情况下都必须保持政治警惕性。党员必须保守党和国家的机密。
    在党员承担高度的、重要的任务的同时，他还被赋予巨大的权利。党章修正草案中说，党员有权利在党的会议上或在党的报刊上参加党的政策问题的自由的、认真的讨论，在党的会议上批评任何工作人员，选举别人和被别人选举到党的机关，凡在通过关于自己的活动或行为的决议时，要求亲自参加，向党的任何机关一直到苏联共产党中央委员会提出任何问题和声明。
    对第十九次党代表大会的准备工作，在各地都充分表现出我国人民对我们的共产党的热爱和拥戴，苏联人民表示，他们愿意在列宁、斯大林党的经过考验的领导下，为伟大的共产主义建设事业付出所有的力量。
