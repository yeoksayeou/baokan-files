    US-UK Joint Intervention in Iranian Oil Nationalization
    Iranian Public Opinion Unanimously Opposes
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, 4th] Tehran News: Truman and Churchill jointly sent a letter to Iranian Prime Minister Mossadegh on August 30, attempting to threaten and lure the Iranian government into submitting to the US-UK monopoly capital group on the issue of oil nationalization. This despicable conspiracy has been unanimously opposed by Iranian public opinion.
    In the letter, Truman and Churchill put forward three suggestions, demanding that the Iranian government submit the issue of compensation for the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which is controlled by the US and British governments, for discussion, and demanding that the Iranian government send representatives to negotiate with the former Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, which was nationalized by the Iranian parliament in April last year. The suggestion stated that after Mossadegh accepted these two conditions, the United States would grant Iran a $10 million loan, and the British government would unfreeze Iran's pound assets.
    After Truman and Churchill's suggestions were published, they immediately aroused unanimous condemnation from Iranian newspapers. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tehran on August 31, Iranian newspapers particularly criticized the United States, saying that the United States and Britain had united to try their best to interfere in Iran's oil nationalization issue, which aroused the anger of the Iranian people. "Witness Newspaper" and "Today's East Newspaper" both said: "We will not sell our independence in exchange for 10 million US dollars." "Witness Newspaper" also said that Truman pretended to be a friend of Iran, but in reality, he was attempting to infringe on Iran's independence.
    The US government's open intervention in Iran's oil nationalization issue this time is the result of a series of behind-the-scenes activities it has recently conducted. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on August 20, Acheson had already sent a memorandum to British Foreign Secretary Eden as early as August 10, stating that the United States was prepared to immediately lend Iran $5 million to $10 million in aid and requested that Britain "cooperate with the United States' financial aid to Iran plan." At the same time, US Ambassador to the UK Gifford, Eden, US Ambassador to Iran Henderson, and British Charge d'Affaires to Iran Middleton held secret talks. Subsequently, US City Oil Service Company Manager Jones flew to Iran to inspect the oil refining center of Abadan and other places. Truman admitted on August 28 that Jones had met with him before going to Iran.

    美英共同干涉伊朗石油国有化
    伊朗舆论一致反对
    【新华社四日讯】德黑兰消息：杜鲁门和邱吉尔在八月三十日联名致函伊朗首相摩萨台，企图威胁利诱伊朗政府在石油国有化问题上向美英垄断资本集团屈服，这一卑鄙阴谋遭到伊朗舆论的一致反对。
    杜鲁门和邱吉尔在信中提出了三项建议，要求伊朗政府把关于前英伊石油公司的赔偿问题提交由美英政府把持的海牙国际法庭讨论，并要求伊朗政府派遣代表与业经伊朗议会于去年四月间通过实行国有化的前英伊石油公司进行谈判。该建议说：在摩萨台接受了这两个条件之后，美国将给予伊朗一千万美元贷款，英国政府将解冻伊朗的英镑财产。
    杜鲁门和邱吉尔的建议发表以后，立即引起伊朗报纸的一致斥责。据法新社德黑兰八月三十一日电称：伊朗各报特别抨击美国，说美国和英国联合起来，想全力干涉伊朗石油国有化问题，引起了伊朗人民的愤怒。“见证报”和“今日东方报”都说：“我们不要把我们的独立卖掉以换取一千万美元。”“见证报”并说：杜鲁门假装与伊朗为友，实际上是企图侵犯伊朗的独立。
    美国政府此次公开出面干涉伊朗石油国有化问题，是它最近进行的一系列幕后活动的结果。据法新社华盛顿八月二十日电透露：艾奇逊早在八月十日，即曾送交英国外交大臣艾登一份备忘录说，美国准备立即贷予伊朗五百万到一千万美元的援助，并要求英国“对美国的财政援助伊朗计划合作”。与此同时，美国驻英大使吉福特与艾登，美国驻伊朗大使韩德逊和英国驻伊朗代办密德尔顿，都曾举行密谈。接着，美国城市石油服务公司经理琼斯又飞往伊朗视察了炼油中心阿巴丹等地。杜鲁门在八月二十八日承认，琼斯在赴伊朗之前，曾与他晤谈。
