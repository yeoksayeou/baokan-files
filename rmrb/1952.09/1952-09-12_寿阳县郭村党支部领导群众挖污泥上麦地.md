    Shouyang County Guo Village Party Branch Leads the Masses to Dredge Mud for Wheat Fields

    Editor: Our Guo Village Party Branch in the Third District of Shouyang County has combined sanitation work with fertilizer production, adding another layer of guarantee for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

    There is a large Ma River (a stagnant pond) in this village, which has accumulated a lot of dirt over the years. Every summer, it not only emits a foul odor but also breeds many mosquitoes, which is very detrimental to the health of the surrounding residents. In early August, the comrades of the village branch studied this situation and believed that the mud from the Ma River was a natural fertilizer. If the mud could be dredged, it would not only benefit environmental hygiene but also increase fertilizer. Therefore, taking advantage of the end of the village’s weeding work, it was decided to organize the remaining labor force to dredge the mud. Under the call of the branch to "dredge mud for fertilizer and eliminate disasters," more than 110 cadres and masses in the village participated in the river dredging work. In five days, the stinky Ma River was turned into a clear pool of water. The masses sent more than 31,000 loads of the dredged mud to their own wheat fields, and it is expected that the wheat harvest will be abundant next year. The farmers said, "Dredging the mud from the Ma River improves sanitation and also accumulates fertilizer. It's really killing two birds with one stone!"

    寿阳县郭村党支部领导群众挖污泥上麦地
    编辑同志：我们寿阳县三区郭村党的支部，把卫生工作和积肥生产结合起来，使明年的麦子丰收多了一层保证。
    这村子里有一条大麻河（是一个死池子），历年来淤积了许多脏物，每到夏天，不仅散发着一种恶臭气味；而且生长了许多蚊虫，很不利于四周居民的健康。八月初，村支部工作同志研究了这个情况，认为麻河的污泥是天然的肥料，如果把污泥挖出来，既有利于环境卫生，又可以增加肥料，于是乘着全村锄苗工作结束时，决定把剩余劳动力组织起来挖泥。全村干部、群众在支部“挖泥积肥，扫除灾害”的号召下，有一百一十余人参加了挖河工作，五天工夫把恶臭的麻河变成了澄清的水池。群众把挖出的污泥三万一千多担送到自己的麦地里，预计明年麦子可以丰收，农民们说：“挖掉麻河的污泥，讲了卫生，还积了肥料，真是一举两得！”
