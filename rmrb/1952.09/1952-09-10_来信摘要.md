Summary of Letters to the Editor

Local People's Governments Should Thoroughly Publicize the 1952 Agricultural Tax Policy

I recently visited Shengze Town, Wujiang County, Southern Jiangsu, and found that some farmers were very unfamiliar with the 1952 agricultural tax policy. Some farmers said: "I heard that this year, land will be surveyed and production will be assessed, and grain will be levied according to the yield. The People's Government is calling on us to increase the yield per unit area, which means we will have to pay more agricultural tax." In fact, the agricultural tax this year has been reduced. This shows that local cadres have not thoroughly publicized the significance of land survey and production assessment, which has caused misunderstandings among the masses. I hope that the people's governments in various places will pay attention to this issue, not only organizing cadres to seriously study the 1952 agricultural tax policy, but also conducting in-depth publicity to the masses to facilitate this year's agricultural tax collection work.

Volunteer Soldiers Need Books and Magazines

We often receive慰劳品(comfort items) sent by the people of the motherland, some of which are shoes and towels. Some shoes are also exquisitely embroidered with words such as "Resist America, Aid Korea" and the names of the shoemakers. This makes us deeply feel the care of the people of the motherland for us. However, we do not lack shoes and towels; and these comfort items have to travel through mountains and rivers to reach the Korean front line, which is very difficult. In order to save transportation capacity and increase the actual effectiveness of the comfort items, in the future, when the people of the motherland send comfort items again, I hope they can send books, magazines and stationery. Because a cultural learning movement is now also unfolding in the Volunteer Army, and cultural food and cultural supplies are precisely what the vast number of Volunteer Army soldiers urgently need.

Certain Agencies in Tonghua City Should Not Sell Timber Without Authorization

In order to strengthen timber management, the Northeast People's Government has clearly stipulated that: except for the Northeast Trade Department system, which promotes timber to the market according to the national plan, no troops, agencies, or other public enterprises shall sell timber. However, some agencies and enterprises still violate laws and regulations and sell timber without authorization. For example, the Tonghua City Engineering Company Lumber Mill of Liaodong Province sold 30 cubic meters of finished timber and logs in the market from April to June this year. The Liaodong Province Forestry Industry Administration stationed in Tonghua City sold more than 10 cubic meters of timber at the state allocation price in June this year.

In order to unify timber management, it is hoped that the above-mentioned units will strictly abide by government laws and regulations and effectively prevent the occurrence of such erroneous behaviors.

The Accumulation of Official Documents by the Construction Section of Changqing County Has Caused Great Losses to Work

The accumulation of notices issued by the higher-level government by the Construction Section of the People's Government of Changqing County, Shandong Province, has caused great losses to the work. For example, the county received a notice from the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry regarding the investigation of summer harvest bumper crops, and the Secretary's Office forwarded it to the Construction Section on June 14. Comrade Zhang Xiaolin of the Construction Section did not read it carefully and simply put it aside. It was not until the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry came to inquire that he found the notice. Another example is that the Tai'an Prefectural Commissioner's Office notified the heads of the Construction Sections of the subordinate counties and typical households of bumper crops to attend a meeting in the special zone, but the Construction Section of Changqing County also put this notice aside. When the meeting was over, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office came to inquire, and the Construction Section remembered this matter. Although the People's Government of Changqing County has now investigated and dealt with the above problems, I think this is a lesson and should attract everyone's attention. Chang Limin

"Sheng Lu Antimony" Injectable Solution is Too Toxic, Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Has Inspected and Dealt with It

"Sheng Lu Antimony" manufactured by Shanghai Private Beiyang Pharmaceutical Factory is a pentavalent antimony preparation for the treatment of kala-azar. Among them, a batch of products caused serious adverse reactions when used in Yuxian County, Henan Province. All patients treated with this batch of drugs felt uncomfortable within ten minutes after injection. Then they felt heart pain, and finally their pulse and breathing stopped. After emergency treatment, it took as long as four hours to regain consciousness, and the heart still hurt for many days. Such a situation has occurred many times, and one child died as a result.

Now, most of the doctors in the Xuchang Special Zone of Henan know this situation and no longer use this medicine. However, this batch of drugs may be large in quantity, and it is hoped that medical and health institutions across the country will pay attention to checking it to avoid similar unfortunate incidents. It is recommended that the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government inspect this medicine and take appropriate measures. Li Chengpu

Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from reader Li Chengpu, we immediately informed the Ministry of Health of the Central Government. Recently, the Ministry of Health replied in a letter: Regarding the problem of excessive toxicity of "Sheng Lu Antimony" produced by Shanghai Private Beiyang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory and the adverse reactions after injection, the East China Health Department also received a report from the Xuzhou Municipal Health Bureau, requesting that the drug be banned. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau sampled "Sheng Lu Antimony" from different batches from the factory and conducted toxicity tests respectively. As a result, many of the test mice died; and it was found that some batches of drugs had excessive arsenic content. Now the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has decided to order the factory to recall and destroy the existing "Sheng Lu Antimony" finished products; and to suspend manufacturing before the technology is improved.

专栏：来信摘要

    来信摘要
    各地人民政府应深入宣传一九五二年农业税收政策
    我最近到苏南吴江县盛泽镇去了一次，发现有些农民对一九五二年农业税收政策很不了解。有的农民说：“听说今年要查田定产，按产量上粮。人民政府号召我们提高单位面积产量，就要多收农业税了。”实则今年的农业税是减轻了。这就说明了当地干部没有深入宣传查田定产的意义，因此引起群众的误解。希望各地人民政府注意这个问题，不仅要组织干部认真学习一九五二年农业税收政策，并且应该深入向群众宣传，以利今年的农业税收工作的开展。　田志良
    志愿军战士需要书报杂志
    我们经常收到祖国人民寄来的慰劳品，其中有一些是鞋子和毛巾。有些鞋子上还精致地绣着“抗美援朝”等字样和制鞋者的姓名。这使我们深刻地感到祖国人民对我们的关怀。但是，我们的鞋子和毛巾并不缺少；而这些慰劳品运到朝鲜前线要经过千山万水，很不容易。为了节省运输力量并增加慰劳品的实际效用，今后祖国人民再寄慰劳品时，希望能改寄书报杂志及文具等用品。因为现在志愿军中也展开了文化学习运动，文化食粮和文化用品正是广大志愿军战士所迫切需要的。

    通化市某些机关不应擅自出售木材
    东北人民政府为加强木材管理，曾经明文规定：除东北贸易部系统按国家计划向市场推销木材外，任何部队、机关及其他公营企业一律不得出售木材。但某些机关、企业却仍违反法令，擅自出售木材。如辽东省通化市工程公司制材厂，今年四月到六月在市场售出成材、原木三十立方米。驻通化市的辽东省森林工业管理局在今年六月份将木材十余立方米按国家调拨价出卖。
    为统一木材管理，希望上述单位严格遵守政府法令，切实防止这种错误行为的发生。

    长清县建设科积压公文使工作受到很大损失
    山东省长清县人民政府建设科积压上级政府发下的通知，使工作受到很大损失。如该县收到山东省农林厅关于调查夏收丰产情况的通知，秘书室在六月十四日批交建设科。建设科张晓林同志也不认真看，就压起来了。直到山东省农林厅来催问时，他才把通知找出来。又如泰安专署通知所属各县建设科长、丰产典型户等到专区开会，长清县建设科也把这个通知压起来了。会期过了，专署来查问时，建设科才想起这件事。现在长清县人民政府虽已检查处理以上的问题，但我觉得这是一个教训，应该引起大家的注意。　　　　　　　常立民
    “圣露锑”注射剂毒性过大上海市卫生局已予检查并作处理
    上海私营北洋化学制药厂制造的“圣露锑”，是治黑热病用的五价锑制剂。其中一批制品，在河南禹县一带使用时，发生了严重的不良反应。凡是使用这批药品治疗的病人，在注射后十几分钟就感觉不适。接着就心里疼，最后脉搏、呼吸也都停了。经过急救，需四小时之久才恢复知觉，并且多少天后心里还疼。这样的情形已发生多起，且有一小孩因此致死。
    现在河南许昌专区一带的医师，已多半知道这种情形，不再使用这种药了。但是这批药可能数量很多，希望全国医药卫生机构都注意检查一下，以免发生类似不幸事件。建议中央人民政府卫生部对这种药进行检查并作适当处理。　　　　　李诚朴
    编者按：我们接到读者李诚朴的来信后，当即把情况转告中央卫生部。最近卫生部来信答复说：关于上海私营北洋化学制药厂出品“圣露锑”毒性过大，注射后有恶劣反应的问题，华东卫生部也接到了徐州市卫生局的报告，要求取缔该药。上海市卫生局向该厂抽取不同批号的“圣露锑”分别作了毒性试验，结果受试验的小白鼠死亡的很多；并且查明部分批号的药品砒素含量过大。现上海市卫生局已决定令该厂把现有的“圣露锑”成品收回销毁；并在技术未改进前停止制造。
