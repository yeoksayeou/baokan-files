Let the Children Live in Peace and Happiness Forever

This summer, many children went to the seaside to escape the heat. The Tianjin Railway Workers' Nursery, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Nursery, and the Beihai Experimental Nursery, among others, spent their summer in Beidaihe. This report depicts the summer life of the children of workers.

In the past, these children often lived in poverty due to their parents' poverty or inability to care for them due to work, lacking clothing and food. As a result, some children were very thin, and some were often ill, their lives were very hard. After liberation, the children's lives improved, and many of them entered nurseries established by the state. Now, with the development of the country's construction, children have the opportunity to spend the hot summer in the scenic area of ​​Beidaihe.

Children's ability to live such a happy life can only be seen in peace-loving countries, which further inspires the people of New China's determination to defend the motherland and defend peace.

The childcare worker told the children: "This is corn, planted by the farmer uncles." After hearing the childcare worker's words, the children shouted in unison, "Thank you, farmer uncles."

The children love to swim in the sea.

The children are accompanied by childcare workers to the seaside to play every morning after breakfast.

No matter how loud the sound of the waves is, it cannot wake the children who are sleeping soundly in the corridor covered by green trees.

The children have abundant food every day, including all kinds of meat, vegetables, fruits, etc. They are having lunch under the shade of trees.

New China has countless young masters like this who are full of talent, and they are all extremely interested in the country's construction. Wang Yongjun drove the train continuously and said with confidence: "We must open up all the railways in the country."

Little girl Sun Xiuqin and her partner Zhang Yinger are building a garden on the beach. They said, "We want to build a good garden and invite the Volunteer Army uncles to live here and tell us stories."

Zhang Junjun and Huo Fanjiang are playing planting trees on the seashore. Zhang Junjun said: "How good it would be to plant a few trees here! It would be nice to cool off when it's hot."

Little tractor driver Song Congzhou said to his partner Li Xiaoying: "Let's start plowing the land now, let's have a competition!"

After dinner, the children happily sing and dance in the yard. This is them dancing the Red Army dance. (Photo by Zhu Bo, our reporter)

During the summer vacation, the children's weight has increased, with the most increasing by seven pounds. Girl Junjun gained three pounds in a month.

Four-year-old girl Lin Ling gave the shells she picked up to her two-year-old younger brother to play with. She said, "I'll give these to you to play with, and I'll pick up some more."

"The canal has been dug, and our steamboat is about to launch."

    让孩子们永远在和平幸福中生活
    今年的夏天，有很多孩子到海滨避暑。在北戴河避暑的有天津铁路职工托儿所、中华全国总工会托儿所、北海实验托儿所等。这里报道的是职工子弟避暑生活的情形。
    这些孩子们在过去，时常因为父母的贫困或因工作而无法照顾，过着缺衣少食的生活。因此，有些孩子非常瘦，有的就经常得病，他们的生活都是很苦的。解放后，孩子们的生活提高了，他们当中已有很多孩子走进国家建立的托儿所。现在，随着国家建设事业的发展，孩子们有条件在海滨风景区度过了炎热的夏天。
    孩子们有条件过这样幸福的生活，只能在爱好和平的国家才能看到，这也就更加激励着新中国的人民保卫祖国、保卫和平的决心。
    保育员告诉孩子们：“这就是玉米，是农民叔叔种的。”孩子们听了保育员的话后一齐喊着“谢谢农民叔叔。”
    孩子们很喜欢洗海水浴。
    孩子们每天早饭后由保育员伴送到海滨上去玩。
    不管海浪声音多么大，却闹不醒正在绿树遮盖着的长廊中酣睡着的孩子们。
    孩子们每天都有丰富的食品，各种肉类、菜蔬、水果等。他们正在树荫下吃午饭。
    新中国有着无数像这样富于天才的小主人，他们都对祖国的建设事业发生极大兴趣。王拥军一连开着火车一边满怀信心地说：“我们要把全国铁路都修通。”
    小女孩孙秀芹和她的伙伴章婴儿正在沙滩上建筑一座花园，她们说：“要造好一座花园，请志愿军叔叔住在这里讲故事给我们听。”
    张军军和霍翻江在海边上作栽树游戏。张军军说：“在这里栽上几棵树多好呵！天热了可以乘乘凉。”
    小拖拉机手宋从周对伙伴李小英说：“现在就开始翻地啦，咱们比赛比赛吧！”
    晚饭后，孩子们在院子里愉快地唱歌、跳舞。这是他们在跳红军舞。（本报记者朱波摄）
    在暑期生活中，孩子们的体重都增加了，最多的增加了七磅。女孩子军军在一个月时间内增加了三磅。
    四岁女孩林玲把自己拾来的贝壳送给两周岁的小弟弟玩，她说：“这些送给你玩吧，我再拾去。”
    “运河挖成了，我们的汽船就要下水了。”
