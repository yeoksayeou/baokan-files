Fujian Province began to expose some problems within the People's Courts after the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and study in August of last year. The "Three-Anti" campaign in January of this year further exposed the serious situation in the People's Courts. Based on this situation, Zhang Dingcheng, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial People's Government, and the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a decision to reform the courts and submitted it to higher authorities for approval, beginning a vigorous effort to transform the courts. However, because the serious situation within the People's Courts at all levels had not been fully exposed, there was a relative lack of complete new working experience, and leaders at all levels were busy with central tasks and had difficulty attending to judicial work. Therefore, this year's judicial reform work has been carried out gradually. Last year's study of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the implementation of the Marriage Law and forest protection campaigns were actually trials for judicial reform. The "Three-Anti" campaign reformed the courts from the perspectives of organization and ideology, and the clearance of backlog cases was actually the formal start of judicial reform work. After the central government and East China issued a comprehensive judicial reform plan and instructions, Fujian Province's judicial reform work was rolled out more comprehensively and systematically.

(II)

Over the past year, Fujian Province's judicial reform work has achieved the following preliminary accomplishments and experiences.

I. The People's Courts' institutions have been initially rectified, a democratic system for the People's Courts has begun to be established, and the organization of the People's Courts has been adapted to the needs of mass movements.

A year ago, due to the recent liberation of the area, the people's judicial institutions at all levels in Fujian were still very incomplete. A total of one provincial court, two municipal courts, two provincial branch courts, and forty-one county judicial sections had been established; six provincial branch courts and twenty-five county judicial sections (or county courts) were still missing. Some courts were reorganized after taking over the old courts, and had not yet been rectified and reformed, so impure phenomena in organization and ideology were serious. Among the judicial cadres in the province, those with corrupt practices, degenerate behavior, and deeply ingrained bad habits accounted for more than 30 percent. The masses said the courts were "old wine in new bottles." At that time, most of the courts operated according to old legal viewpoints. One type of person held blatant reactionary old legal viewpoints; they were relatively few in number, but their harm to the country and the people was great. The masses had "four helps" and "five nots" reactions to them. The "four helps" were: (1) helping counter-revolutionaries harm the people; (2) helping landlords oppress farmers; (3) helping illegal capitalists oppress workers; (4) helping lawbreakers evade punishment. The "five nots" were: (1) Ignoring: emphasizing that they did not meet judicial procedures, and not accepting the accusations of the people; (2) Not summoning: even if they were considered, summons were delayed for a long time; (3) Not questioning: even if the parties were summoned, questioning was delayed; (4) Not judging: even after questioning, judgment was delayed for a long time; (5) Not executing: even after judgment, it was not executed. Some masses said: "In the Kuomintang era, lawsuits required a lot of money; now, lawsuits require a long life." Another type was some old cadres in the judicial departments (including some leading cadres) and new intellectual cadres who were also affected by the old legal viewpoints to varying degrees. This group was larger. They did not fully understand that the People's Courts were an important tool of the people's democratic dictatorship and relied without principle on those old judicial personnel who had not undergone thorough ideological transformation, believing they were familiar with the business; but they did not value cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds, believing they did not understand the business.

Over the past year, after various movements, especially after the "Three-Anti" campaign, the court organization has undergone partial transformation and rectification. The courts throughout the province have separately dealt with a group of corrupt, degenerate, and deeply depraved individuals who were not suitable to remain in court work, and the organization of the People's Courts has been initially purified. At the same time, a democratic system suitable for the current situation is being experimentally established in the People's Courts: reporting to the People's Congress, listening to criticisms and suggestions from the masses; in handling cases, in addition to relying on the People's Tribunals, organizational forms similar to the People's Tribunals have also been adopted for mass cases in certain regions and periods. For example, Yongchun County adopted the form of a temporary People's Tribunal when dealing with marriage cases, while Fuzhou City adopted forms such as mass judgment meetings or deliberation meetings. This organization is composed of personnel from the court and relevant departments, district and township cadres, activists, or representatives elected by the masses, and can quickly and effectively mobilize the masses to handle cases. The Provincial People's Court has also established four mixed trial groups under the Civil Court and Criminal Court: the first group is specifically responsible for mobilizing the masses to fight against hostile classes and counter-revolutionaries; the second group is specifically responsible for mobilizing the masses to fight against illegal bourgeois elements; the third group is specifically responsible for mobilizing the masses to implement the Marriage Law; and the fourth group is responsible for handling general cases.

Summarizing the experience of court organization rectification during this period, on the one hand, the People's Courts must strictly maintain leadership under the working class and the Communist Party, be composed of people who truly represent the interests of the people, especially workers and peasants, and constantly struggle against old legal viewpoints and all erroneous ideologies and work styles that are divorced from the masses and reality, in order to maintain and improve the ideological and stylistic purity of the People's Courts. On the other hand, it is necessary to establish the democratic system that should exist at present, break the old bureaucratic organizational structure, and replace it with a new organizational construction that meets the current central tasks of the People's Judiciary; in particular, it is necessary to adopt as much as possible the experience and organizational forms of the People's Tribunals to carry out work, so that the People's Courts can fully adapt to the needs of national construction and mass movements.

II. The question of who the People's Courts serve and what they do has been initially resolved.

The cadre composition of the People's Courts includes some who have done old judicial work and received old judicial education, and some new cadres who have not done judicial work, with fewer old cadres. The former believed that they already understood judicial business, while the latter suffered from not being familiar with what judicial work should do. In addition, due to lack of experience, they unconsciously followed the old ways, and many cadres were also unconsciously eroded and influenced by the old legal viewpoints. They did not attach importance to the People's Tribunals and rarely handled cases of workers and peasants; even if they did, it was occasional and passive; they did not conduct systematic investigation and research and actively, systematically, and step by step served the broad masses of people. Therefore, the work performance of the courts was very small. When the masses talked about the People's Tribunals, they gave a thumbs up and said "excellent," but when they talked about the People's Courts, they shook their heads and said nothing. Court cadres' thoughts also fluctuated because of this, saying that doing judicial work was "atoning for sins."

Based on these situations, we summarized the experience of the People's Tribunals, studied the current tasks and policies of the Party and the People's Government and the instructions of the higher judicial departments, made a systematic investigation of the local class relations and the demands of the broad masses, and, in a certain period and in a certain region, put forward certain tasks for judicial work based on the current work tasks. In our work, we first carried out propaganda to the masses and mobilized them to expose reactionary elements and lawbreakers; then we relied on the strength of the masses to carry out trial and handling work. This made judicial work subordinate to and serve the current political tasks and mass movements, which is to say, subordinate to and serve the most pressing interests of the broad masses of people. For example, when the situation of forest destruction in various places was serious in September of last year, the People's Courts in various places, under the leadership of the local Party committees and the People's Governments, universally called on the masses to launch forest protection movements, and separately dealt with the elements destroying forests according to the policy of combining punishment and education. Shuiji County also conducted a public sentencing of those who destroyed forests at the county People's Congress, and organized all People's Representatives to go back and assist the People's Courts in handling forest destruction cases throughout the county, launching a mass forest protection movement. In terms of implementing the Marriage Law, the Yongchun County People's Court, with the assistance of the Provincial Court's circuit court and under the unified leadership of the county Party committee and county head, convened a conference of more than 700 district and township cadres and activists to mobilize them and launch a county-wide Marriage Law implementation movement through them, basically solving the county's marriage problems within two months. When housing disputes in Dongshan County were more serious, the mediation committee and neighborhood committees mobilized the masses of the entire county to handle more than 700 housing dispute cases in 20 days, solving the housing dispute problems in the entire county. When the situation of slaughtering cattle was serious in Yongding County, the masses were actively and systematically mobilized to inspect the slaughtering of cattle, and the cases of slaughtering cattle were appropriately handled, generally stopping the phenomenon of slaughtering cattle. These facts all prove that only by actively, systematically, and step by step serving the broad masses of people and carrying out mass movements can the People's Courts play their due role.

III. The mass line in judicial work has begun to be implemented.

Judging from the development of work over the past year, we feel that the past experience of circuit trials, on-the-spot trials, and collective trials is no longer sufficient, and the experience of the mass line of the People's Tribunals must be developed and enriched. Widely mobilizing the masses to use the experience of the People's Tribunals means that when the masses have not been fully mobilized, the main task is to systematically publicize laws and conduct investigations and research, and to promptly publicly try and deal with bad elements who hinder the development of the movement in order to support the masses and promote the movement; when the masses have been mobilized but are not familiar with the policies and the movement is difficult to deepen, the policies should be specifically explained by the pronouncement of typical cases to guide the movement and ensure that the movement develops deeply and healthily; when the movement develops to its fullest extent, the masses dare to struggle and understand the policies, and a large number of cases emerge, the People's Courts or People's Tribunals should rely on the masses and handle them quickly and in a timely manner through the masses using the method of combining leadership and the masses; when the movement is successfully concluded, the People's Courts or People's Tribunals should promptly summarize the experience of the masses' struggle in order to improve cadres, educate the masses, and consolidate the people's rule of law. When inspecting the implementation of the Marriage Law last year, we used the experience of the People's Tribunals, changed the old rules of handling cases in the past, and organized three inspection teams and circuit courts with basically equal strength to experiment with the mass line of judicial work in the three regions of northern Fujian, Minhou, and southern Fujian. The circuit court in northern Fujian went to the countryside to convene forums of activists to discuss marriage issues, discovered marriage cases from the masses, repeatedly investigated among the masses, and then collectively pronounced judgments, which had a very good impact on the masses, but did not solve many problems for the masses. The Minhou circuit court convened a rural peasant representative meeting to promote the Marriage Law, first letting the representatives ask questions as much as possible, solving the representatives' ideological concerns one by one, and then letting the representatives go back to promote the Marriage Law, and bringing up the marriage cases existing in the township for the masses to discuss; then the circuit court pronounced judgments at a mass meeting. This had a very good effect in individual villages, but the overall effect was not very great. The circuit court in southern Fujian used the experience of the People's Tribunals in land reform, and the effect was greatly different: their first step was to seize a wife-killer as a typical case, first sending the handling opinions to cadres at the county, district, and township levels for discussion, and then having representatives from each township participate in the public trial, and sentenced him to death; the second step was to convene a conference of more than 700 cadres and activists at the county, district, and township levels to promote the Marriage Law and organize typical grievance-airing to overcome the feudal ideas in township cadres and activists; then the township cadres and activists made self-criticisms, and typical cases were pronounced at the meeting of township cadres and activists; the third step was that the circuit court split up to work in two districts, and also convened a conference of the same nature, promoted the Marriage Law, organized grievance-airing, self-criticisms, and put forward cases; the fourth step was to use cadres from the circuit court as the backbone, and combine with township cadres and activists to form temporary People's Tribunals, and go to each township in these two districts to handle marriage cases together with the masses; the fifth step was to expand from the two pilot districts to the entire county. The 17 cadres of the circuit court handled more than 700 marriage cases in one month, and mobilized the broad masses. The masses said that implementing the Marriage Law was equivalent to a "small land reform." In places where the circuit court had not arrived, the masses also sent representatives to invite the circuit court to go.

The process of judicial reform work in the Fujian Provincial People's Court also illustrates the importance of implementing the mass line. The judicial reform work of the Provincial Court first combined the "Three-Anti" movement to carry out the study of opposing corruption and bending the law, explaining that the People's Courts are an important tool of the people's democratic dictatorship and that cadres of the People's Courts are not allowed to follow the old ways to engage in activities that violate the interests of the people and the country, and launched a widespread inspection movement among all cadres in the court, which had a great effect. However, at that time, it was not combined with a systematic ideological and work style transformation, which was a major shortcoming, and is now being "made up for."

Secondly, a work group of dozens of people was organized to interview the masses, especially litigants, to collect materials and solicit their opinions on the People's Courts. The masses were initially apprehensive and afraid to speak. The work group immediately stated its attitude, explaining the determination of the Provincial Chairman and the President of the Court to transform the court; then various forums were convened to enlighten the masses to expose and denounce the corrupt and law-bending elements in the People's Courts. On the basis of the initial mobilization of the masses, a rally of litigants was convened to expose the corrupt and law-bending elements in the court, and a led "face-to-face" struggle was launched, further mobilizing the masses.

When dealing with corrupt, degenerate, deeply depraved, and unredeemable elements, a representative mass meeting of more than 400 people was convened. All court personnel participated in the meeting, and representatives from all walks of life and various democratic parties were also invited. The more than 400 representatives brought more than 2,000 opinions from more than 20,000 people, of which more than 700 opinions requested the removal and replacement of bad elements among the old judicial personnel, accounting for about 41 percent; and opinions requesting the court to handle cases for the broad masses and rectify the judicial work style accounted for 41 percent. The Provincial People's Court dealt with the bad elements in the court separately according to the specific circumstances and the opinions of the masses, and at the same time added some judges from worker, peasant, and intellectual backgrounds who were loyal to the interests of the people.

Most of the more than 2,000 opinions put forward by the masses were correct. From the acceptance of cases to the judgment and execution of cases, from the President of the Court and the presiding judge to the bailiff, the masses put forward very good opinions. After we accepted these opinions, the masses happily said: "This kind of court is truly a people's court." Representatives from various democratic parties also expressed their support for the People's Government's determination and measures to implement judicial reform work. The staff of the court also saw that many problems that they had wanted to solve in the past but could not solve now had a way to solve them, and their work confidence was greatly increased, and they recognized the errors of the old practices in the past. The personnel who were dealt with also expressed their conviction and requested to be given the opportunity to reform.

Afterwards, we launched a mass campaign to clear backlog cases in accordance with the experience of the People's Tribunals and the opinions of the masses, letting the broad masses of people implement the reform of judicial work with us. For example, the Fuzhou Municipal People's Court organized a work group of nearly 100 people and 1,100 grassroots cadres, mobilized about 62,000 people, and correctly handled 3,100 cases in 20 days. To date, it is estimated that the masses are preparing to put forward thousands more cases.

The above experience proves that the transformation of the court, whether in terms of organization, ideology and work style, or work system, must rely on the masses, otherwise it will be difficult to succeed.

IV. The work style of seeking truth from facts has begun to be established in trial work.

Although the court also had investigation work in the past, it rarely conducted investigations among workers and peasants, so many cases were not handled well or errors occurred. In implementing the Marriage Law, only investigations were conducted among a small number of poor peasants and hired laborers, so marriage cases could not be handled correctly either. Later, we determined that investigations should first be conducted among the working people, and also among other classes, and then the materials should be repeatedly checked and discussed by the court, the parties, and the masses to discuss the handling methods. The result of doing so guaranteed the accuracy of the materials and the correctness of the handling, and the masses generally responded very well. In terms of sentencing, we generally tried to line up cases of the same nature, compare them with each other, and then make judgments based on the law and the needs of the current movement, which avoided the tendencies of being excessively harsh or lenient and being divorced from the movement in sentencing.

(III)

Fujian Province's judicial reform work has had some achievements. However, these reforms have only been carried out in the Provincial Court and a small number of municipal and county courts, and most of them have been carried out in conjunction with the "Three-Anti" movement, which is not comprehensive and in-depth enough. Therefore, it is currently necessary to promote and continue to deepen the judicial reform work: those that have been reformed but not thoroughly need to be thoroughly reformed; those that have been thoroughly reformed must also summarize the experience and consolidate the results already achieved in terms of ideology, organization, and the establishment of a democratic system; those that have not yet been reformed must actively prepare for reform. The entire judicial reform work in the second half of the year is planned to be carried out in two phases, requiring the completion of the judicial reform work in one-third of the regions before September, and the completion of all work before the end of the year.

The current problems are: first, some cadres still do not understand that judicial reform work is a mass movement and the central task of current judicial work, and therefore are entangled in some general day-to-day affairs, especially the work of clearing backlog cases, and cannot put all their efforts into judicial reform work. Second, some cadres do not recognize that carrying out ideological and work style transformation and rectification and eliminating old legal viewpoints are important contents of judicial reform work, believing that the organizational composition of the court is now basically pure, and there is nothing to reform; or believing that old cadres and people who have not done old judicial work do not have old legal viewpoints, and are unwilling to conduct ideological inspections. Third, when studying to oppose old legal viewpoints, some people said: "We don't know what old legal viewpoints are, and we don't know what new legal viewpoints are. We will do whatever the higher authorities tell us to do." Some people were afraid of being punished after exposing old legal viewpoints. These phenomena are important obstacles in the current judicial reform work. In order to remove these obstacles, we put forward the following solutions:

First, courts at all levels must regard judicial reform work as a mass movement and the central task of current judicial work. The organization of the court must first be thoroughly transformed and rectified in this movement.

Second, it should be recognized that judicial reform work is not only an organizational transformation and a work reform, but also an ideological and work style transformation to eliminate various erroneous old legal viewpoints. Organizational rectification and ideological transformation should generally be carried out in combination.

Third, when carrying out ideological and work style transformation and organizational rectification, inspections must be carried out from top to bottom. Those cadres who are seriously affected by old legal viewpoints should of course be distinguished from old judicial personnel with deeply ingrained bad habits, but they must also be ordered to make profound self-criticisms. Those who insist on not changing after ideological struggle should be given certain disciplinary punishments; those who are not suitable for court work should be allowed to transfer to other jobs; and corrupt and law-bending elements with serious circumstances must be dealt with according to the law. For general cadres and those who are only affected by some old legal viewpoints, they should mainly be enlightened and guided from the experience of summarizing the People's Tribunals, so that they can use their personal experience to criticize and overcome the influence of old legal viewpoints and improve their revolutionary consciousness. Those who have done good work should be commended or promoted.

    福建省的司法改革工作
    福建省人民法院院长　曾镜冰
    （一）
    福建省自去年八月镇压反革命学习以后，就开始暴露出人民法院中的一些问题。今年一月“三反”运动中，更暴露出人民法院的严重情况。根据这种情况，省人民政府张鼎丞主席和中共福建省委会就作了改造法院的决定，报请上级批准，开始了大力改造法院的工作。但因各级人民法院内部的严重情况尚未充分暴露，比较完整的新的工作经验还不很多，而各级领导又忙于中心工作，对司法工作难于照顾。因此，这一年来的司法改革工作是逐步地进行的。去年八月镇压反革命的学习，贯彻婚姻法及护林等运动，实际是进行司法改革的试验。“三反”运动中从法院的组织上和思想作风上进行了改革，清理积案实际是司法改革工作的正式开始。在中央和华东发出了全盘司法改革的计划和指示以后，福建省的司法改革工作才更全面、更有计划地展开。
    （二）
    一年来福建省的司法改革工作，获得了下列初步成就与经验。
    一、初步整顿了人民法院的机构，开始建立了人民法院的民主制度，并使人民法院的组织适应于群众运动的需要。
    一年前，由于地方解放不久，福建各级人民司法机构还很不健全，共计建立了一个省法院、两个市法院、两个省分院和四十一个县司法科；尚缺六个省分院及二十五个县司法科（或县法院）。有些法院是接管旧法院后改组而成，尚未来得及整顿改造，所以组织上和思想作风上的不纯现象是严重的。在全省司法干部中，有贪赃枉法行为以及堕落蜕化、恶习甚深的坏分子占了百分之三十以上。群众说法院是“换汤不换药”。那时的法院大多按照旧法观点办事。一种人是有露骨的反动的旧法观点，数目比较少，但对国家和人民的危害很大。群众对他们有“四帮”“五不”的反映。“四帮”是：（1）帮助反革命危害人民；（2）帮助地主压迫农民；
    （3）帮助不法资本家压迫工人；（4）帮助违法分子开脱罪责。“五不”是：（1）不理：强调不合司法程序，不受理人民群众的控告；（2）不传：虽然理了，但又拖延很久，不发传票；（3）不问：当事人传来了又拖延不问；（4）不判：问了以后也好久不判；（5）不行：判后又不执行。有些群众说：“国民党时期打官司要钱多，现在打官司要寿长。”另一种是司法部门有些老干部（包括一部分领导干部在内）和新的知识分子干部，也在不同程度上受到旧法观点的影响，这种人比较多。他们不完全懂得人民法院是人民民主专政的重要工具，无原则地倚重那些未经彻底思想改造的旧司法人员，认为他们熟悉业务；而对工农出身的干部则不重视，认为他们不懂业务。
    一年来经过各种运动，特别是经过“三反”运动，法院组织已进行了部分的改造与整顿。全省法院已分别处理了一批贪赃枉法、堕落蜕化分子和恶习甚深、不宜留在法院工作的分子，初步纯洁了人民法院的组织。同时在人民法院中试验着建立适合于当前情况的民主制度：向人民代表会议做报告，听取人民群众的批评和建议；在处理案件时，除依靠人民法庭之外，对一定地区与一定时期内的群众性案件，也采取了类似人民法庭的组织形式。如永春县处理婚姻案件时采取了临时人民法庭的形式，福州市则采取了群众评判会或评议会等形式。这种组织是由法院及有关部门的人员、区乡干部、积极分子或群众选出的代表组成，能够既快又好地发动群众处理案件。省人民法院在民庭与刑庭下也分设了四个混合审判组：第一组专门负责发动群众对敌对阶级和反革命分子作斗争；第二组专门负责发动群众对不法资产阶级分子斗争；第三组专门负责发动群众贯彻执行婚姻法；第四组负责处理一般案件。
    总结这一时期法院组织整顿的经验，一方面是人民法院必须严格地保持在工人阶级和共产党的领导下，由真正代表人民特别是工人、农民利益的人组成，不断地与旧法观点及一切脱离群众、脱离实际的错误思想作风进行斗争，以保持与提高人民法院思想上和作风上的纯洁性；另一方面，必需建立起目前应有的民主制度，打碎旧的官僚主义的组织机构，代之以新的符合目前人民司法中心任务的组织建设；特别应尽量采取人民法庭的经验及其组织形式去进行工作，使人民法院完全适应国家建设和群众运动的需要。
    二、初步解决了人民法院为谁服务与做什么的问题。
    人民法院的干部成分，一部分是做过旧司法工作、受过旧司法教育的，一部分是未做过司法工作的新干部，老干部较少。前者认为自己已懂得司法业务，后者则苦于不熟悉司法工作应该做什么，加上缺乏经验，就无形中沿袭了旧的一套，而不少干部也不自觉地受了旧法观点的侵蚀和影响。他们不重视人民法庭，很少办理工人、农民的案件；即使办理，也是偶然的、被动的；不进行系统的调查研究，主动地、有计划地、有步骤地为广大人民服务。因此，法院的工作成绩很小。群众谈到人民法庭时就把拇指一伸说“呱呱叫”，谈到人民法院时则摇摇头，不说话。法院干部思想也因此而有波动，说干司法工作是“戴罪立功”。
    根据这些情况，我们总结了人民法庭的经验，研究了党和人民政府的当前任务和政策以及上级司法部门的指示，对当时当地的阶级关系与广大群众的要求作了系统的调查，并在一定时期与一定地区内根据当前工作任务，提出了司法工作的一定任务。在工作中，首先向群众进行宣传，发动群众检举反动分子和违法分子；然后又依靠群众力量进行审判处理工作。这样就使司法工作服从和服务于当前的政治任务与群众运动，也就是服从和服务于当前广大人民的最迫切利益。如去年九月各地破坏森林情况严重时，各地人民法院即在各地党委及人民政府领导下，普遍号召群众展开护林运动，根据惩罚与教育相结合的方针，分别处理了破坏森林的分子。水吉县并在县人民代表会议上对破坏森林的分子进行了公开的宣判，组织全体人民代表回去协助人民法院在全县范围内处理破坏森林案件，开展了群众性的护林运动。在贯彻婚姻法方面，永春县人民法院在省法院巡回法庭协助下及县委、县长统一领导下，召开了全县区乡干部、积极分子共七百余人的大会，进行动员，通过他们开展了全县规模的贯彻婚姻法运动，在两个月内基本解决了全县的婚姻问题。东山县城在房屋纠纷较严重时，通过调解委员会及居民委员会，发动全县城的群众在二十天内处理了七百多件房屋纠纷案，解决了全城的房屋纠纷问题。永定县在宰杀耕牛情况严重时，主动地、有计划地发动群众检查宰杀耕牛情况，适当地处理了宰杀耕牛的案件，一般地停止了宰杀耕牛的现象。这些事实都证明了：只有主动地、有计划、有步骤地为广大群众服务，开展群众运动，才能发挥人民法院应有的作用。
    三、开始贯彻了司法工作中的群众路线。
    从一年来工作发展的情况看，我们觉得过去巡回审判、就地审判、集体审判的经验已不够用，必须将人民法庭的群众路线的经验加以发挥和充实。广泛发动群众运用人民法庭的经验是：当群众还未充分发动起来的时候，主要是有计划地宣传法令和调查研究，对阻碍运动发展的坏分子及时公审处理，以支持群众，推动运动；当群众已经发动起来、但不熟悉政策、运动难于深入时，则以典型案件的宣判来具体交代政策，以指导运动，保证运动深入地健康地发展；当运动发展到饱满时，群众既敢于斗争，又懂得政策，大量的案件涌现出来，人民法院或人民法庭都应该依靠群众，通过群众，运用领导与群众相结合的方法，加以迅速及时的处理；当运动胜利结束时，人民法院或人民法庭应及时总结群众斗争的经验，以提高干部，教育群众，巩固人民的法治。在去年检查婚姻法的执行情况时，我们运用了人民法庭的经验，改变了过去法院办案的老规矩，组织了三个检查组及巡回法庭，力量基本相等，分别到闽北、闽侯、闽南三个地区去实验司法工作的群众路线。闽北的巡回法庭下乡召集积极分子座谈会讨论婚姻问题，从群众中发现婚姻案件，又在群众中反复调查，然后集体宣判，对群众影响很好，但解决群众问题还不很多。闽侯巡回法庭召开乡农民代表会宣传婚姻法，首先尽量让代表提问题，一一解决代表们的思想顾虑，然后通过代表回去宣传婚姻法，将乡中存在的婚姻案件都提出来，让群众讨论；再由巡回法庭在群众大会上宣判。这样在个别乡村中收效很好，但总的收效也不很大。闽南巡回法庭运用了土地改革中人民法庭的经验，效果就大为不同：他们第一步抓住一个杀妻犯为典型，先将处理意见发给全县区乡干部讨论，然后由各乡派代表来参加公审，判以死刑；第二步召集全县区乡干部、积极分子七百余人的大会，宣传婚姻法，组织典型诉苦，以克服乡干部和积极分子中的封建思想；然后由乡干部和积极分子作自我检讨，并将典型案件在乡干部、积极分子会上宣判；第三步，巡回法庭分开到两个区去工作，也召开了同样性质的大会，宣传婚姻法，组织诉苦，自我检讨，提出案件；第四步，以巡回法庭干部作骨干，配合乡干部、积极分子混合组成临时人民法庭，分赴这两区的各乡与群众一起处理婚姻案件；第五步，由两个试点区开展到全县。巡回法庭十七个干部，一个月处理了七百多件婚姻案件，把广大群众发动了起来。群众说，执行婚姻法等于一次“小土改”。巡回法庭未到的地方，群众还派了代表请巡回法庭去。
    福建省人民法院进行司法改革工作的过程，同样说明贯彻群众路线的重要性。省法院的司法改革工作，首先是结合“三反”运动进行反对贪赃枉法的学习，说明人民法院是人民民主专政的重要工具，不允许人民法院的干部沿袭旧的一套来进行违反人民和国家利益的勾当，发动全院干部开展普遍的检查运动，收效很大。但当时还没有结合进行有系统的思想作风的改造，是一个很大的缺点，现在正在
    “补课”。
    其次，组织了数十人的工作组，向群众特别是诉讼当事人进行访问，搜集材料，并征求他们对人民法院的意见。群众起初有顾虑，不敢说。工作组即表明态度，说明省主席和院长对于改造法院的决心；接着召开各种座谈会，启发群众对人民法院中的贪赃枉法分子进行检举、揭发。在群众已有初步发动的基础上，即召开诉讼当事人对法院内贪赃枉法分子的检举大会，展开了有领导的“面对面”的斗争，进一步发动了群众。
    在处理贪赃枉法、堕落蜕化、恶习甚深、不堪改造的分子时，召开了一次有代表性的四百多人的群众大会。大会由法院全体人员参加，也邀各界人士和各民主党派代表参加。四百多个代表带来了两万多群众所提的两千多条意见，其中要求清除与撤换旧司法人员中坏分子的意见有七百多件，约占百分之四十一；要求法院为广大群众办案、整顿司法作风的意见占百分之四十一。省人民法院根据具体情况及群众意见，对法院的坏分子作了分别处理，同时增加了一些忠实于人民利益的工农及知识分子的审判员。
    群众所提出的两千多条意见，大部分是正确的。从受理案件到案件的判决、执行，从院长、庭长到法警，群众都提了很好的意见。我们接受了这些意见以后，群众高兴地说：“这样的法院才真正是人民的法院。”各民主党派的代表也表示拥护人民政府实行司法改革工作的决心和措施。法院的工作人员也看到许多过去想解决而不能解决的问题，现在有了解决的途径，工作信心大大提高，并认识了过去旧的做法的错误。被处理的人员，也表示心服，要求给他们以改造的机会。
    以后，我们又按照人民法庭的经验及群众的意见，展开了群众性的清理积案工作，让广大群众与我们一起实行司法工作的改革。如福州市人民法院这次组织了近百人的工作组及一千一百个基层干部，发动了约六万二千个群众，在二十天内正确地处理了三千一百个案件。到目前止，估计群众准备提出的案件尚有数千件。
    以上经验证明，法院的改造，不论在组织上、思想作风上或工作制度上，都必须依靠群众，否则难于成功。
    四、开始在审判工作中树立了实事求是的作风。
    过去法院虽也有调查工作，但很少向工人、农民作调查，所以很多案件处理不好或发生错误。在贯彻婚姻法中，又只向少数贫雇农作调查，因此也不能正确处理婚姻案件。以后我们确定：首先应向劳动人民作调查，同时也要向其他阶层作调查，然后通过法院、当事人、群众三方面反复核对材料，讨论处理办法。这样做的结果，保证了材料的准确和处理的正确，群众一般反映很好。在量刑上，一般是尽量将性质相同的案件排好队，互相评比后，再根据法律及当前运动的需要实行判决，这样就避免了量刑中的畸重畸轻及脱离运动的偏向。
    （三）
    福建省的司法改革工作，是有一些成绩的。但这些改革还只是在省法院及少数市、县法院中进行，而且多是结合“三反”运动进行的，还不够全面与深入。因此，目前还需要将司法改革工作推广及继续深入：已进行改革但不彻底的，需要搞彻底；已改革彻底的，也要总结经验，从思想上、组织上以及建立民主制度上巩固既得的成果；尚未改革的，则要积极准备改革。下半年的整个司法改革工作，我们计划分为两期进行，要求在九月以前完成三分之一地区的司法改革工作，年底以前全部完成。
    目前存在的问题是：第一、还有些干部不懂得司法改革工作是一个群众运动，是目前司法工作的中心任务，因而被一些一般的日常事务特别是清理积案工作纠缠住，不能把全部力量投入司法改革工作。第二、还有些干部不认识进行思想作风的改造与整顿、清除旧法观点，是司法改革工作的重要内容，以为法院组织成分现已基本纯洁，就没有什么可以改革的了；或者以为老干部及没有做过旧司法工作的人即没有旧法观点，而不愿意进行思想检查。第三、在进行反旧法观点的学习时，有些人说：“我们不知道什么是旧法观点，也不知道什么是新法观点，上级要我们怎样做就怎样做。”有的则怕暴露了旧法观点后要受处分。这些现象是目前司法改革工作中的重要障碍。为扫除这些障碍，我们提出以下几个解决办法：
    第一、各级法院必须把司法改革工作当作一个群众运动和当前司法工作的中心任务。法院的组织必须在这次运动中首先加以彻底的改造和整顿。
    第二、应认识司法改革工作不仅是组织上的改造与工作上的改革，还要从思想上、作风上实行改造，清除各种错误的旧法观点。组织整顿与思想改造一般应结合进行。
    第三、在进行思想作风的改造与组织整顿时，必须自上而下地进行检查。对那些受到旧法观点严重影响的干部，固然应当和恶习甚深的旧司法人员区别开来，但也必须责令深刻检讨。经过思想斗争而坚持不改者，应给以一定的纪律处分；不适合作法院工作的，应让其转业；情节严重的贪赃枉法分子，则必须予以法办。对一般干部和只受到旧法观点某些影响的，主要应从总结人民法庭经验中启发他们，引导他们，使他们用切身经验来批判与克服旧法观点的影响，提高革命觉悟。对工作好的则应给以表扬或提拔。
