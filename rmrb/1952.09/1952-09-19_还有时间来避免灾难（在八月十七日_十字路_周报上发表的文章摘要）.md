    There is Still Time to Avert Disaster
    (Summary of an article published in the "Crossroads" weekly on August 17)
    Gu'er Baxi·Xinge, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council
    Never in history have the people of Asia faced such a danger of complete destruction of all their wealth and valuable possessions as they do today. Millions of people have been killed in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, and the valuable property they have accumulated over many centuries has been massively destroyed. Those who hate peace, create and maintain war hysteria, and shamelessly boast about various weapons of mass destruction are few in number, and under the pressure of world public opinion, they have been forced to hold armistice talks with the Korean and Chinese sides. However, just when peace seemed within reach, they violated all international laws and proposed the unheard-of method of "voluntary repatriation" of prisoners of war, while also massacring hundreds of prisoners of war. Before this shocking event was over, they were bombing non-military targets far from the battlefield. At the same time, the enemies of peace are remilitarizing Japan and Germany.
    The people of Asian and Pacific countries have recognized this serious situation, and therefore will send their representatives to Beijing to participate in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. There is no doubt about the seriousness of the situation, and it is equally certain that there is no other way to prevent war except to unite the will of all peace-loving people in the world.
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be an extremely important gathering, and the discussions at the conference will greatly affect the issue of war or peace in Asia, thereby affecting world peace. If all Asian countries can help each other, strengthen themselves, and drive out all foreign interference from their land, then world peace will not be disturbed. U.S. imperialism and other European imperialist countries are jointly opposing the people of Asia and their friends in order to maintain their wealth in Asian colonies.
    Let us peace-loving Asians unite closely, do our best, and make the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and the Third All-India Peace Conference a success. (Xinhua News Agency)

    还有时间来避免灾难
    （在八月十七日“十字路”周报上发表的文章摘要）
    全印和平理事会副主席  古尔·巴克希·辛格
    亚洲人民在历史上从来没有像今天这样面临过他们的全部财富和有价值的东西被完全毁灭的危险。千百万人民已在朝鲜、越南和马来亚被杀死，许多世纪以来他们所积累的宝贵财产已遭到大规模的毁灭。那些憎恨和平、制造并维持战争歇斯底里、无耻地吹嘘各种大规模杀人武器的人是为数很少的，在世界人民舆论的压力下，他们已被迫和朝中方面举行停战谈判。可是，就在和平眼看就可实现的时候，他们又违反一切国际法规，提出了闻所未闻的“自愿遣返”战俘的办法，同时又屠杀了数以百计的战俘。这个骇人听闻的事犹还未了，他们又在对远离战场的非军事目标进行滥炸。与此同时，和平的敌人又在使日本和德国重新军国主义化。
    亚洲及太平洋区域国家的人民已认识到这种严重的局势，因此将派遣他们的代表到北京去参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议。局势的严重是无可怀疑的，同样无可怀疑的是：除开全世界爱好和平的人民的意志统一起来以外，没有其他的办法来防止战争。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将是一个极重要的集会，会议所讨论的将大大地影响到亚洲的战争或是和平问题，从而影响全世界的和平。假如亚洲所有国家能互相帮助，加强自己，在它们的土地上赶走一切外国干涉者，那么世界和平就将不致受骚扰。美帝国主义及其他欧洲帝国主义国家就是为了维持他们在亚洲殖民地的财富，才共同反对亚洲人民及其朋友。
    让我们爱好和平的亚洲人，紧密地团结在一起，竭尽力量，使亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议与第三届全印和平大会开得成功。（新华社）
