    A Great Happy Event for 300,000 People in Bengbu City
    To the Editor: After completing many important municipal constructions, the Bengbu Municipal People's Government has established a Water Plant Construction Committee, and is now actively burying water pipes. It is expected that tap water will be supplied by the beginning of 1953. This is a great happy event for the 300,000 people of the city.
    The rapid construction of Bengbu is inseparable from the great victory of harnessing the Huai River. I recall that during the Huai River flood in 1950, the market in Bengbu was unusually depressed. Since Chairman Mao called for "We must harness the Huai River well," the first phase of the Huai River harnessing project has been successfully completed one after another in a short period of two years. The disaster of the Huai River has been gradually overcome, and the bumper harvest of vast farmland on both sides of the Huai River has been guaranteed. Bengbu City has also prospered. Many new-style buildings have been completed, and the main streets of the city have been renovated to be wide and flat. Recently, the People's Government has built a water plant. Bengbu City is about to rapidly develop from a dilapidated city destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries into a new city of the people. This is a great victory under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao! Every person in Bengbu is excited and encouraged by this, and is determined to respond to all the calls of Chairman Mao and dedicate their strength to building a lovable motherland.

    蚌埠市三十万人民的大喜事
    编辑同志：蚌埠市人民政府在完成了许多重要的市政建设之后，又成立了水厂建筑委员会，现在正积极地埋装水管，预计到一九五三年初就可以供应自来水了。这是全市三十万人民的一件大喜事。
    蚌埠市飞跃的建设是与治淮的伟大胜利分不开的。回忆一九五○年淮河水灾时，蚌埠市面异常萧条。自从毛主席号召“一定要把淮河修好”之后，在短短的两年中，治淮工程一期跟着一期胜利完成。淮河的灾害逐渐被战胜，淮河两岸广大农田的丰收得到保证，蚌埠市随着也繁荣起来了。许多新式的楼房落成了，全市主要街道都修得又宽又平，最近人民政府又建设了自来水厂。蚌埠市就要由一个被国民党反动派摧残的破落城市迅速地发展为人民的新城市了。这是毛主席英明领导的伟大胜利！蚌埠市每一个人民都为此感到欢欣鼓舞，并决心响应毛主席的一切号召，为建设可爱的祖国而献出自己的力量。
