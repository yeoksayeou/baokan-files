Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 29th, according to Romanian News Agency: The Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau's organ刊 "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" recently published an editorial entitled "The Party of Lenin and Stalin Leads the Soviet People Towards Communism." The editorial said: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) has announced that the 19th Party Congress will be held on October 5th. The convening of this congress is a major event in the lives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and all Soviet people, and it is also an event of great international significance. The editorial pointed out: The congress is being held almost on the eve of the 35th anniversary of the great October Revolution. The world-historically significant fruits of the Soviet people and all their remarkable achievements are inextricably linked with the Bolshevik Party. Under the leadership of the Communist Party led by Stalin, the Soviet working people completed the great plans of socialist industrialization of the country and collectivization of agriculture, thus making the Soviet Union a strong industrial and collective agricultural country. At the 18th Congress of the CPSU, Stalin, in his report, put forward a great historical task for the Party and all Soviet people: in order to be able to transition from the first stage of communism to its second stage, in the next fifteen or ten years, economically, that is, in terms of industrial output per capita, we must catch up with and surpass the major capitalist countries. The Soviet people warmly welcomed this plan and enthusiastically strived for its realization. The treacherous attack of Hitlerite Germany on the Soviet Union interrupted the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people. But after the Soviet Union destroyed Hitler's war machine and Japanese imperialism, it concentrated all its efforts on completing the first post-war five-year plan for the further development of the socialist country. The Soviet people have achieved remarkable successes in the struggle to realize this plan. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, work on changing nature has begun on a large scale. The gigantic water conservancy projects on the Volga, Dnieper, Don, and Amu Darya rivers are the harbingers of the communist tomorrow. The Soviet Union's fifth five-year plan stipulates the creation of a new and tremendous upsurge in the development of the Soviet national economy. Its completion will mark a major step forward on the road of development from socialism to communism.

The editorial concluded: The draft directives of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan for Development from 1951 to 1955 and the revision of the Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have been warmly welcomed by all Communist and Workers' Parties and have caused a great reaction in the international working-class movement. The people of the world are heartily rejoicing over the new and powerful upsurge of the Soviet national economy and the strengthening of the strength of the socialist country at the forefront of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. They warmly welcome the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and endorse the Soviet Union's fifth five-year plan. Honest people in all countries recognize that this five-year plan for peaceful economic and cultural construction will promote the further strengthening and expansion of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and promote the development of trade between all countries willing to develop trade on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表社论
    论述联共第十九次代表大会的伟大意义
    【新华社三十一日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十九日讯：共产党和工人党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”最近一期，发表题为“列宁和斯大林的党领导苏联人民走向共产主义”的社论。社论说：苏联共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会已经宣布在十月五日召开第十九次党代表大会。这次大会的召开是苏联共产党和全苏联人民的生活中的重大事件，也是一桩具有巨大国际意义的事件。社论指出：代表大会差不多是在伟大的十月革命三十五周年纪念日的前夕召开的。苏联人民的具有世界历史意义的果实，他们的一切卓越成就，和布尔什维克党不可分地联结在一起。苏联劳动人民在斯大林所领导的共产党的领导下，完成了使国家社会主义工业化和农业集体化的伟大计划，因而使苏联成为一个强大工业和集体农业的国家。在联共第十八次党代表大会上，斯大林在报告中曾给党和全苏联人民提出一个伟大的历史任务：为了能够从共产主义的第一阶段过渡到它的第二阶段，在今后十五年或十年内，在经济上，也就是在按人口平均计算的工业产量方面，要赶上并超过主要的资本主义国家。苏联人民曾热烈地欢迎这个计划，并热烈地为其实现而努力。希特勒德国对苏联发动的背信弃义的进攻，中断了苏联人民的和平创造性劳动。但苏联在摧毁了希特勒的战争机器和日本帝国主义以后，就集中全力来完成进一步发展社会主义国家的战后第一个五年计划。苏联人民在争取实现这个计划的斗争中获得了卓越的成就。在共产党的领导下，改变自然的工作已经大规模地开始。伏尔加河、第聂伯河、顿河和阿姆河上的巨大水利建设工程，是共产主义的明天的先驱。苏联第五个五年计划规定要造成一个苏联国民经济发展的新的巨大的高潮。它的完成将表明在由社会主义到共产主义的发展道路上前进一大步。
    社论最后说：一九五一年—一九五五年苏联发展五年计划指示草案和苏联共产党党章修正案，已经获得了所有的共产党和工人党的热烈欢迎；在国际工人阶级运动中引起了巨大的反应。全世界的人民都为苏联国民经济的新的强有力的高涨，为走在和平、民主与社会主义阵营最前列的社会主义国家的力量的加强而感到由衷的欢欣。他们热烈欢迎苏联共产党第十九次代表大会，赞同苏联第五个五年计划。一切国家的正直的人民都认识到：这个和平的经济与文化建设五年计划，将促进苏联和人民民主国家间的经济合作的进一步加强与扩大，促进一切愿意在平等互利的基础上发展贸易的国家之间的贸易的发展。
