    Welcoming the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Wu Yuzhang, President of the Renmin University of China
    Representing the sixteen hundred million people's good wishes and lofty will for peace, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference is about to be held in Beijing. It can be expected that this historic grand event will widely mobilize and unite the forces of all peace-loving people in the region, making a great contribution to the peace movement; it will also enhance cultural exchanges between the people of various countries in the region and open up broader avenues for the development of friendly relations between the people of all countries.
    The people of the Asian and Pacific regions love peace and cultural prosperity. The people of every country have, for generations, created their own excellent cultural achievements through peaceful labor, learning from each other, exchanging with each other, and enriching the general treasury of human progressive culture with common contributions. For example, the people of China, India, Japan, and many other Asian countries have a long history of cultural exchange. For many years, the struggles of the people of many countries against imperialist aggression and to escape national oppression have filled almost the entire history. After the defeat of Japanese imperialism, the people of all countries hoped or are striving to heal the wounds of war and establish their own peaceful lives. The Soviet people are developing science to transform nature and build great communist projects, implementing a new five-year plan that marks "peaceful economic and cultural construction," setting an inspiring example for the people of the world. We, the victorious Chinese people, inheriting the national tradition of loving peace, are defending peace on the one hand with the struggle against aggression, and strengthening the forces of peace on the other hand with the achievements of economic and cultural construction. With the advent of the high tide of our country's economic construction, the people's cultural and educational undertakings are developing rapidly on an unprecedented scale. For example, the patriotic health campaign and the rapid literacy campaign recently launched throughout the country have achieved remarkable results that were impossible before liberation. People can also excitedly see that the people of many countries are striving to fight against imperialist aggression and for national liberation and peace and democracy. Many friendly cultural exchanges are deepening the mutual understanding between people of different countries.
    However, a handful of warmongers headed by US imperialism are ambitiously stepping up their conspiracy to expand the war of aggression, attempting to drag the world into a tragic catastrophe so that they can make a fortune from blood and fire. They have spread the dark clouds of war from the West to the East. Unwilling to accept the failure of the war of aggression against Korea, they stubbornly delayed the armistice negotiations and wantonly bombed peaceful residents; revived Japanese militarism, and vainly attempted to make them "lead Asia" and re-invade China, the Soviet Union, and other countries; used force to interfere in national independence and liberation movements, endangering the territorial and sovereign integrity of many countries, controlling the economy, blockading trade, and hindering cultural development; and also conspired to conclude the so-called "Pacific Pact" to further plan aggression. On the one hand, they are frantically destroying excellent culture; on the other hand, they are using culture and education as tools to anesthetize and deceive the people. People cannot help but painfully see that cities and cultural treasures built over hundreds of years are being destroyed by war, beneficial cultural undertakings are being closed and banned, famous scientists, professors, and writers are being thrown into prison, young students are being persecuted, and many cultural and educational workers who are dedicated to the cause of peace are losing their freedom, and some are even unable to return to their own country. As a result of the arms race, the lives of the people in many countries are increasingly plunged into a painful situation. Military expenditures accounted for more than 80 percent of the US budget for the fiscal year 1952-1953, while education expenditures accounted for less than 1 percent. In this year's financial budget of the Japanese government under the patronage of the United States, direct and indirect military expenditures also accounted for 70 percent. They also use arrogant and vicious lies and slander to deceive and distort the facts, using slanderous words such as "freedom," "humanitarianism," and "defense against communist aggression" to cover up their aggressive purposes, controlling newspapers, radio, movies, and all other cultural tools to clamor for war, instigate racial hatred, and conduct militaristic education. There are countless evil deeds. US imperialism even lost its conscience and used bacteriological weapons, making science degenerate into a tool for mass slaughter of mankind. As Joliot-Curie said, this is "the most heinous chapter in human history." The "frenzied march of the world aggression policy" directed by the warmongers is rampant, threatening the development of culture and the survival of mankind.
    In this way, the serious situation is clearly placed before the people of Asia and the Pacific region and the world, and the responsibility of saving peace inspires the hearts of every honest and simple person. The heroic struggle of the patriotic Japanese people to strive for peace, independence, and democracy, and to oppose the revival of militarist forces is rising day by day. The forces of the people of Southeast Asia and Australia to defend peace and the forces of the people of North and South America to strive for independence and peace are growing stronger. The broad masses of people in India, Burma, Indonesia, and other countries are rising up to fight for peace. In these struggles, we see that cultural and educational workers in various countries have carried out solemn work. If some people were once isolated in a web of deception, then people are now increasingly aware that the aggressive policy of US imperialism is incompatible with the noble ideals, rational dignity, and happy future of mankind. Therefore, everyone is enthusiastically seeking ways to establish lasting peace and friendship between people of different ways of life. Many people feel threatened by war and are changing their attitude of bystanders, gradually realizing the personal responsibility of saving the great cause of peace. Many people who have been mentally anxious due to the horrors of war have seen the light of hope under the powerful influence of the peace movement and have strengthened their belief in the struggle. Based on their own experience and the proof of facts, people are increasingly recognizing the true face of the imperialist warmongers, increasingly understanding that the face of Asia and the world has undergone and continues to undergo tremendous changes, and increasingly believing that the unity of the people themselves is a strong and invincible force. In the struggle between peace and war, civilization and barbarism, we see the boundaries between enemies and friends very clearly: all peace-loving people, regardless of political views and religious beliefs, should be friends living in peace with each other, while the enemies of peace are our common enemies, that is, the enemies of culture and the enemies of human survival.
    Today, the inseparable relationship between peace and culture is even more obvious. Saving peace and stopping war is the primary prerequisite for cultural prosperity; and developing cultural exchanges and strengthening the unity and mutual trust of the people are important factors in establishing peace. Because of this, cultural and educational workers in our countries have a special role in the peace movement. The cause of cultural and educational workers itself is a position for defending peace. We should make our work always serve the purpose of promoting the truth of peace and creating human happiness. Our profession and activities enable us to have close ties with the broad masses, to widely and deeply spread the seeds of culture, to publicize the truth of peace, to break the foul atmosphere of war clamor, and to awaken people's vigilance. In particular, American cultural, educational, and scientific workers have a more active responsibility to stop war and strive for peace. We Chinese cultural and educational workers are all honored to be propaganda soldiers of peace. We have used practical actions to build the country and defend peace. We must continue to work tirelessly and advance side by side with friends from all countries.
    On the eve of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, we are full of excitement and confidence, sincerely extending our hand of friendship to the respectable cultural and educational workers in India, Japan, the United States, and other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, and expressing our sincere welcome and deep respect to the representatives of cultural and educational workers and all peace fighters who have come to our capital. Let the ranks of our peace lovers and defenders advance mightily like the hundreds of rivers along the Pacific coast flowing into the sea. Peace will surely triumph over war.

### 欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议

    欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    中国人民大学校长　吴玉章
    代表着十六亿人民对于和平的善良的愿望与崇高意志，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在北京举行了。可以预期：这次有历史意义的盛会将会广泛地动员与团结本区域一切爱好和平的人民的力量，对和平运动作出巨大的贡献；同时也将会增进本区域各国人民之间的文化交流，为发展各国人民的友好关系开辟更广阔的道路。
    亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民是热爱和平与文化繁荣的。每一个国家的人民，都世世代代地用和平的劳动创造了自己优秀的文化成果，互相学习，彼此交流，并用共同的贡献丰富了人类进步文化的总宝库。例如中国、印度和日本以及许多亚洲国家的人民，就都有着悠久的文化交流的历史关系。多年以来，许多国家的人民为反对帝国主义侵略、摆脱民族压迫而进行的斗争，几乎充满了整个历史。在日本帝国主义被打败以后，各国人民都希望或者正在努力医治战争的创伤，建立自己的和平生活。苏联人民正在发展科学用以改造自然，建设伟大的共产主义工程，实行标志着“和平的经济与文化建设”的新五年计划，在全世界人民面前树立了令人鼓舞的榜样。我们胜利了的中国人民，继承着爱好和平的民族传统，正在一方面以反侵略的斗争保卫和平；一方面用经济与文化建设的成就来加强和平的力量。随着我国经济建设高潮的到来，人民的文化教育事业正在以空前的规模迅速发展，例如最近在全国范围内展开的爱国卫生运动和速成识字运动，就取得了在解放前不可能有的显著成绩。人们还可以兴奋地看到，许多国家的人民都在努力为反对帝国主义的侵略、争取民族解放与和平民主而斗争。许多友好的文化交流工作，正在加深着不同国度的人民之间的相互了解。
    但是，以美国帝国主义为首的一小撮战争贩子们，却正在野心勃勃地加紧扩大侵略战争的阴谋，企图把世界拖入惨痛的浩劫，而使他们自己从血与火里大发横财。他们从西方到东方布满了战争的阴云。他们不甘心于侵朝战争的失败，于是横蛮拖延停战谈判，狂轰滥炸和平居民；复活日本军国主义，并妄想使他们来“领导亚洲”，重新侵略中国、苏联和其他国家；用武力干涉民族独立解放运动，危害许多国家的领土与主权完整，控制经济、封锁贸易，阻止文化发展；还阴谋订立所谓“太平洋公约”以进一步策划侵略。他们一方面疯狂破坏优秀的文化；一方面又利用文化教育作工具来麻醉和欺骗人民。人们不能不痛心地看到：数百年建立起来的城市连同文化宝藏在被战火毁灭，有益的文化事业被封闭与查禁，著名的科学家、教授、作家被投入牢狱，年青的学生被迫害，许多致力于和平事业的文化教育工作者失掉自由，甚至有的不能回到自己的祖国。由于扩军备战的结果，许多国家人民的生活日益陷入痛苦的境地。美国一九五二——一九五三会计年度的预算中军事费用占了百分之八十以上，而教育费用不足百分之一。在美国扶植下的日本政府今年的财政预算中直接和间接的军费也占了百分之七十。他们还用狂妄恶毒的谎言和毁谤来蒙蔽和歪曲事实，用“自由”、“人道”、“防御共产主义侵略”等诬蔑的词句来掩盖侵略目的，控制了报纸、广播、电影等一切文化工具来叫嚣战争，煽动种族仇恨，进行军国主义教育，种种恶行，不胜枚举。美国帝国主义甚至丧尽天良，使用细菌武器，使科学堕落为大量屠杀人类的工具，正如约里奥—居里所说，这是“人类历史上最凶恶的一章”。战争贩子们所指挥的“世界侵略政策的狂燥进行曲”正在大肆嚣张，威胁着文化的发展和人类的生存。
    这样，严重的形势就明显地摆在亚洲和太平洋区域以及全世界人民的面前，拯救和平的责任激励着每一个正直而纯朴的人的心灵。爱国的日本人民为了争取和平、独立与民主，反对复活军国主义势力的英勇斗争日益高涨，东南亚及澳洲各国人民保卫和平的力量和南北美洲人民为争取独立与和平而斗争的力量都在日益壮大，印度、缅甸、印尼等国广大人民更奋起为争取和平而斗争。在这些斗争中，我们看到：各国的文化教育工作者进行了庄严的工作。如果说，有些人过去曾经被隔绝在欺骗的罗网之中，那么，人们现在就越来越多地认识到美帝国主义的侵略政策是与人类的高贵理想、理性尊严和幸福前途不相容的。因此，大家就热心地来寻求在不同的生活方式的人们之间建立持久和平与友好的道路。许多人们感到战争的威胁而改变着自己的旁观态度，逐渐觉察到挽救和平大业的切身责任。许多曾经被战争的恐怖弄得心神焦虑的人们，在和平运动的强大影响下，看到了希望的光芒，坚强了斗争的信念。人们根据自身的经验和事实的证明，日益认识了帝国主义战争贩子们的真面目，日益懂得亚洲和世界的面貌已经发生了并且在继续发生着巨大的变化，日益明确相信人民自己的团结乃是坚强无敌的力量。在和平与战争、文明与野蛮的斗争中，我们把敌友的界限看得十分分明：一切爱好和平的人们，不分政治见解和宗教信仰，彼此都应该是和平共居的朋友，而和平的敌人则是我们共同的敌人，也就是文化的敌人，人类生存的敌人。
    今天，和平与文化的不可分割的关系是更加明显了。拯救和平，制止战争，正是繁荣文化的首要前提；而发展文化交流，加强人民的团结互信，又是建立和平的重要因素。正因为这样，所以我们各国的文化教育工作者在和平运动中就有着特殊的作用。文化教育工作者的事业本身就是保卫和平的岗位，我们应该使自己的工作永远为宣扬和平的真理、创造人类的幸福而服务。我们的职业和活动使我们和广大群众有着密切联系，能够广泛深入地传播文化的种子，宣传和平的真理，以打破战争叫嚣的污浊氛围，唤起人们的警惕。特别是美国文化教育和科学工作者更有积极起来制止战争、争取和平的责任。我们中国的文化教育工作者，都以作为和平的宣传战士为光荣，曾经用实际行动来建设国家，保卫和平，一定还要继续不懈地努力，和各国的朋友们一同并肩前进。
    当此亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的前夕，我们满怀兴奋和信心，诚挚地向印度、日本、美国以及亚洲和太平洋区域其他各国可敬的文化教育工作者们伸出友谊之手，并对各国文化教育工作者代表们和所有的和平战士们来到我国首都表示热诚的欢迎和深厚的敬意。让我们和平的爱好者和保卫者的队伍像太平洋沿岸的百川归海一样，浩浩荡荡地前进。和平一定战胜战争。
