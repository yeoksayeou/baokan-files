Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 18th: "Pravda" published an international commentary on September 18th, written by Marinin, commenting on the sudden dissolution of the Japanese Diet by the Yoshida government and the announcement of new elections. The commentary stated:

	The Yoshida government's foreign and domestic policies have clearly encountered a crisis, which is the fundamental reason for the sudden dissolution of the Diet—a Diet in which the Liberal Party held a majority. The U.S. State Department is very uneasy because if this government remains in power for a while longer, it may cause serious disputes. Holding a sudden election can form something like a coalition cabinet to maintain the current political line. Backstage negotiations on this matter have been going on for a long time, involving the leaders of the Liberal Party, the notorious war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru, the leader of the so-called Progressive Party, and the leaders of the right-wing of the Socialist Party.

	Uniting all patriotic forces in the country and establishing a national united front is the fundamental principle of the Japanese Communist Party in this election. The Japanese Communist Party calls on the people to rise up against the Liberal Party's policy of dividing the country, so that all honest members of this ruling reactionary party are not influenced by the party.

	Marinin then pointed out that a quarter of all candidates are former army and navy generals and officers, large entrepreneurs, and bureaucrats who were banned from political activities after the end of the war.

	Marinin then said: Until recently, the ruling group still wanted to somewhat conceal the actual situation of restoring the Japanese army, but now all the masks have been dropped. Japanese militarism is no longer just a potential threat to peace in the Far East; this threat to peace in the Far East is already a definite reality. Yoshida openly said that Japan wants to "lead Asia." Naturally, he mentioned the "generous consent" of the United States, but he forgot to add the sentence: the price of this "consent" is turning Japan into a vassal of the United States.

	Japan's progressive forces resolutely oppose this vicious, traitorous policy pursued by the ruling class—a ruling class that has made the country a slave of Wall Street. In 1952, the Japanese people's struggle has greatly intensified. Even bourgeois parties are increasingly opposed to the policies of the Yoshida government.

	Marinin concluded: Japanese patriots resolutely oppose all these reactionary conspiracies, and they have begun to form a broad national front to fight for peace, freedom, and national independence.

    苏联“真理报”发表国际评论
    评述日本国会选举
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”十八日刊载马里宁所写的一篇国际评论，评述吉田政府突然解散日本国会和宣布举行新的选举。评论写道：
    吉田政府的外交与内政政策显然已遇到危机，这是国会——自由党占多数的国会——突然解散的基本原因。美国国务院感到非常不安，因为如果这个政府再当权一些时候，那也许会引起严重的纠纷。突然搞一下选举，可以组成联合内阁之类的东西，以维持目前的政治路线。关于这方面的幕后谈判老早已在进行，参加的有自由党首领，臭名远扬的战犯、所谓改进党的首领重光葵和社会党右派首领。
    团结国内一切爱国力量，建立民族统一战线，这是日本共产党在这次选举中所持的立场的根本原则。日本共产党号召人民起来反对自由党所奉行的分裂国家的政策，使这个当政的反动政党里的一切正直的党员不受该党的影响。
    马里宁接着指出：全部候选人中有四分之一是前陆军和海军将领和军官、大企业家和官僚，这些人在大战结束以后曾被禁止从事政治活动。
    马里宁接着说：直到最近为止，统治集团还想多少掩饰一下恢复日本军队的实际情况，可是现在一切假面具都丢下了。日本军国主义已不再仅是远东和平的潜在的威胁，这种对远东和平的威胁已是肯定的现实了。吉田公然说日本想“领导亚洲”。很自然，他提到美国“慷慨同意”，可是他忘记加上这样一句话：这种“同意”的代价是把日本变成美国的附庸。
    日本进步势力坚决反对统治阶级所奉行的这种恶毒的卖国政策——统治阶级已使这个国家成为华尔街的奴仆。在一九五二年当中，日本人民的斗争已大大加强。甚至连资产阶级政党也愈来愈反对吉田政府的政策。
    马里宁在结语中说：日本爱国志士坚决反对这一切反动的阴谋，他们已开始结成广泛的民族战线，为争取和平、自由与民族独立而斗争。
