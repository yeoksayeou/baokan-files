    Yangquan City Grain Company Employees Rescue Large Quantities of Grain in Wind and Rain

    Editor: The entire staff of the Yangquan City Company of the China National Grain Corporation, with selfless spirit, rescued 400,000 jin of millet and more than 1,300 bags of flour in the face of wind and rain. Most of the company's grain is stored in the open air. On the afternoon of August 23rd, the weather suddenly changed. The employees quickly covered the grain with tarpaulins and mats, and the porters rushed to move the flour into the warehouse. However, there was still a carload of flour on the freight yard, and 400,000 jin of millet being transferred to other provinces was being loaded onto the train. At this time, the wind and rain had already arrived. The strong wind blew away the tarpaulins and mats covering the grain, and all the grain would soon be soaked by the rain. In this emergency, the warehouse leaders led all the custodians to cover the grain in the storm, and also dredged the drainage ditches next to the cargo berths to drain the accumulated water on the berths and inside the train cars. At the same time, they organized all the employees to rush the grain into the warehouse and pour the wet rice into empty warehouses to dry. They worked until 12 o'clock in the evening. Some comrades continued to guard the three train cars of grain to be transferred to other provinces, and also unloaded three train cars of grain transported from Taiyuan, persisting until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning before resting.

    阳泉市粮食公司全体职工在狂风暴雨中抢护大批粮食
    编辑同志：中国粮食公司阳泉市公司全体职工，以忘我的精神，在狂风暴雨中抢护了四十万斤小米，一千三百余袋面粉。该公司的粮食大部在露天储存，八月二十三日下午，天气突然变化，职工们赶快用篷布、席子遮盖粮食，搬运工人抢着把面粉运入仓库。但货场上还有一车面粉，和向外省调拨的四十万斤小米，正在装车，这时狂风暴雨已经来了。大风吹掉遮盖粮食的篷布和席子，全部粮食很快就会被暴雨淋湿。在这种紧急情况下，仓库负责同志带领全体保管同志，在暴风雨中盖好粮食，又把货位旁边的水渠沟通，把货位上的积水和车皮内的积水排除。同时又组织全体职工把粮食抢入库中，把湿米倒入空库晾翻。他们一直工作到晚间十二点钟。一部分同志继续看守着三车皮向外调拨的粮食，又卸了三车皮由太原运来的粮食，一直坚持到清晨三、四点钟才休息。
