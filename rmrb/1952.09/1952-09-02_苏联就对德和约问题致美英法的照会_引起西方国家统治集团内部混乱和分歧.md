Xinhua News Agency, September 30th: The Soviet government's note of August 23rd to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the issue of a German peace treaty has caused confusion within Western ruling circles and exacerbated the contradictions and divisions between the ruling groups of the United States and Britain and France.

    Major American bourgeois newspapers have published commentaries expressing fear that the Soviet note's proposal to convene a four-power conference will delay the US's preparations for war in Western Europe. The "New York Herald Tribune" worriedly wrote that negotiations with the Soviet Union "will delay the implementation of the European Defense Community agreement and may cause differences of opinion among the countries in this group." The Associated Press also expressed concern on the 24th when commenting on the Soviet proposal: "A four-power conference would frustrate Western defense plans" because, according to the agency's estimation, the Soviet representative's speech at the conference would move "the German desire for unification" and "the French concern about rearming Germany." Based on this consideration, the "New York Times" editorial irritably proposed that the Soviet proposal to hold a four-power conference to discuss the German issue "must be rejected immediately."

    However, these arguments of American bourgeois newspapers and news agencies have not been fully supported by the bourgeois public opinion circles in Western European countries.

    In Britain, even a Conservative Party newspaper like "The Times" could not fail to recognize that the Soviet note put forward new and specific proposals. The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent pointed out that the Soviet note opened up new prospects. The newspaper's Berlin correspondent said that almost every German would be deeply impressed by the Soviet proposal to hold a four-power conference. This correspondent also said that although the Western countries and the Soviet Union start from opposite angles on the issue of the conference agenda, it is still possible to find some common ground in the future. The "Daily Express" suggested "making every effort to reach an agreement through discussion." The paper also believed that "the fact that Russia is still willing to negotiate should not be ignored, and Russia's note deserves extremely in-depth discussion." The "News Chronicle" editorial also believed that the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from both East and West Germany to participate in the election investigation team "may not be a bad proposal."

    In France, some bourgeois newspapers believe that the proposal for a four-power conference in the Soviet proposal is appropriate. "L'Aurore" said: "We do not think that continuing negotiations is a waste of time, (although) past meetings have been fruitless, but we must hold hope." The "Franc-Tireur" editorial said that "conciliatory efforts" should be continued. The paper also talked about the "objective conditions" that should not be forgotten when holding negotiations with the Soviet Union, "this objective condition is developing not only in government agencies, but also among the people of all countries." News from Paris Radio said that many French commentators also believe that Western countries should accept the Soviet proposal.

    Under such circumstances, even the so-called "qualified people in Washington" had to consider that rejecting the Soviet proposal would cause great indignation among the people of all countries, and declared on the 24th: "The issue of public opinion must be considered, and it would be foolish to immediately reject the proposal to hold a meeting." (Agence France-Presse)

    Therefore, the Associated Press Washington dispatch on the 24th described the current psychological characteristics of the Western ruling groups as "unwilling to make people think that the West opposes German unification or opposes negotiations with Moscow," while on the other hand, they are unwilling to abandon the policy of deepening German division and arming West Germany. For the Western ruling groups, this is indeed a thorny issue.

    苏联就对德和约问题致美英法的照会
    引起西方国家统治集团内部混乱和分歧
    【新华社三十日讯】苏联政府八月二十三日就对德和约问题致美、英、法三国政府的照会，已经引起了西方国家统治集团内部的混乱，并加深了美国与英、法两国统治集团之间的矛盾与分歧。
    美国资产阶级的各大报纸纷纷发表评论，害怕苏联照会关于召开四国会议的建议将延缓美国在西欧的备战步骤。“纽约先驱论坛报”忧虑地写道：与苏联谈判“将会使得欧洲防务集团的协定迟迟不能实施，并可能引起这个集团中各国之间的意见分歧。”美联社二十四日在评论苏联建议时也担忧：“四大国会议会使西方防御计划受到挫折”，因为据该社估计，苏联代表在这个会议上的发言，将会打动“德国人要求统一的愿望”和“法国人对重新武装德国的忧虑”。基于这种考虑，“纽约时报”的社论暴躁地提出：苏联主张举行四国会议讨论德国问题的建议“必须马上加以拒绝”。
    但是，美国资产阶级报纸及通讯社的这种主张，并没有完全得到西欧各国资产阶级舆论界的支持。
    在英国，甚至于像“泰晤士报”这样的保守党的报纸，也不能不承认，苏联照会提出了新的具体建议。该报外交记者指出：苏联照会打开了新的前景。该报驻柏林记者说：几乎每一个德国人，都一定会对苏联所提举行四国会议的建议有十分深刻的印象。这个记者又说：虽然西方国家和苏联在会议议程问题上是从相反的角度出发的，但将来仍然是有可能求得某种一致的观点的。“每日快报”则建议“进行一切努力，以期通过讨论而达成协议”。该报并认为：“不应忽视俄国仍然是愿意谈判的这一事实，俄国的照会值得极其深入地加以讨论。”“新闻纪事报”的社论也认为，苏联所提出的邀请东德和西德双方代表参加选举调查团的建议，“也许并不是不好的建议”。
    在法国，一部分资产阶级的报纸认为，苏联建议中所提出的举行四国会议的建议是适当的。“震旦报”说：“我们不认为继续谈判是浪费时间，过去的会议（虽然）是没有成果的，可是我们必须抱着希望。”“义勇军报”的社论说：应该继续进行“和解性的努力”，该报并谈到，不应忘记与苏联举行谈判的“客观条件”，“这种客观条件不仅在政府机关中，并且在世界各国人民中发展着。”巴黎广播电台的消息说：法国许多评论家也都认为：西方国家应该接受苏联的建议。
    在这种情况之下，就连所谓“华盛顿有资格的人士”也不得不考虑到，拒绝苏联建议将要引起各国人民的极大愤慨，而在二十四日宣称：“舆论的问题是必须要考虑的，立即拒绝举行会议的建议是很愚昧的作法。”（法新社）
    因此，美联社华盛顿二十四日消息中描写了西方国家统治集团目前的心理特点是，“不愿意使人以为好像西方反对德国统一，或是反对和莫斯科谈判似的”，另一方面又不肯放弃加深德国分裂和武装西德的政策。对于西方国家统治集团来说，这确是一个棘手的问题。
