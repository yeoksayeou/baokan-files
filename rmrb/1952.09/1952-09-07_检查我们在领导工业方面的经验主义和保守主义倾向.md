Examining Our Empiricism and Conservatism Tendencies in Leading Industry
The CCP Xuanhua City Committee

Since entering the city, the vast majority of Party members and cadres in Xuanhua City, Chahar Province, have maintained a spirit of hard work and simplicity, and have indeed achieved some successes in their work. However, these achievements have not kept pace with the needs of the objective situation. The most essential reason for this is that we are still using narrow empiricist and conservative methods in the face of the brand-new urban work, especially the work related to workers and industry. Because of serious empiricism, we don't look forward, our political instincts are very dull, we lack a keen sense of new things, and our thinking is very narrow. Many comrades spend their days spinning around in trivial matters. Some comrades have even shown ignorant arrogance, believing that if they don't know something or if something doesn't exist in their area, it probably doesn't exist in the world. They don't dare to boldly experiment with and promote advanced production methods published in newspapers or reported by higher authorities. They also fail to systematically, precisely analyze, summarize, and promote the creative inventions of local workers. For the new creations and new records of the workers, they only know what they are, but not why they are. In short, because of our long-standing empiricism, many lively and dynamic things in production cannot develop healthily.

The tendencies of conservatism and empiricism are specifically manifested in the following aspects:

I. Experiences from other places cannot be promoted in a timely manner, and local experiences cannot be summarized in a timely manner. Some factories and mines are timid and emphasize difficulties in accepting and promoting advanced experiences. Some factories even say: "Our factory's production tasks are small, so there is no need to promote advanced experiences." Or they say: "That's Soviet, that's from the Northeast, the conditions here are not suitable, so we can't imitate it." Even worse, they blame the workers for being "conservative and backward," but fail to strengthen leadership. Last May, Longyan Iron Mine sent people to Beijing to learn the high-speed cutting method, but they delayed its implementation after returning. It wasn't until the workers "rebelled" during the "Three-Anti" campaign that they began to implement it. Ma Wanshui's advanced experience in tunneling iron ore has not been summarized for more than two years, until the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau sent people this time to summarize it. The experiences of Liu Fuhai's fast train connection method and safe operation with overloaded axles, Baoxing Coal Mine's safe production, Xiahuayuan Power Plant's Ma Yingcheng's thousand-day accident-free record and this quick repair, the paper mill's quick cooking, the iron smelting plant's several new iron tapping records, and the Mining Bureau's reforms in production and management, have not been seriously summarized and promoted. Some have been summarized, but only vaguely mention a few "quicks," "diligences," and "precautions," giving people only a vague impression, making it difficult for people to remember. Some factory and mine leaders do not pay attention to the experiences that have already been summarized and written elsewhere, but bury themselves in aimless searching. Some leaders do not see or cannot see the small creations and small advanced experiences of their factory workers, thinking that "scattered and fragmented experiences are not worth summarizing." Facts have proven that advanced production experiences exist in all factories and mines in Xuanhua City, and they are abundant. When the Central Iron and Steel Industry Bureau went to Pangjiabao this time to summarize Ma Wanshui's rapid tunneling method, the engineers said: "Many aspects of Ma Wanshui's various operating techniques are consistent with the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union." The fact that all advanced production experiences in factories and mines have not been well summarized and promoted in a timely manner is due to the serious empiricism and conservatism of the leadership.

II. In the leadership work of factories and mines, the main links cannot be grasped; or there is a "go-it-alone" style, losing sight of one thing while attending to another, without any clue; or inheriting the "all-inclusive" working methods of the past in rural work; or failing to make careful plans in advance, relying only on personal accumulated bits of experience, lacking foresight and scientific analysis in work, and therefore failing to grasp the laws of motion, often falling into a passive position. The leadership of the Municipal Party Committee has a general tendency. The comrades of the Municipal Party Committee do not regularly go deep into factories and mines to study the implementation of policies and improve leadership skills, but instead shout empty political slogans. They have learned very little about business management, economic accounting, and other operations so far. The Municipal Party Committee summarizes its work mostly to report to higher authorities, not to effectively guide the actual work of various factories and mines. The Municipal Party Committee has also held many joint meetings on factory and mine work, but due to insufficient preparation before the meetings, they have not been able to effectively exchange and summarize experiences through the meetings. The work of some directly affiliated departments of the city (including the organization and propaganda departments of the Municipal Party Committee) has basically not broken through the city circle. The Party affairs work of various factories and mines is also very weak.

III. The idea of relying on the working class is not clear, and a resolute attitude has not been taken to support the rationalization proposals of workers. This is true of the leadership of factories and mines, and it is also true of the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee. They have not truly gone deep into factories and mines to understand the ideological trends and opinions of the working class, have not established deep feelings and friendships with the worker comrades, and have not put their opinions on the agenda for serious discussion and research, which has resulted in many valuable rationalization proposals being buried for a long time. The losses caused to production are immeasurable. In addition, there is also confusion in the understanding of the positive significance of labor models in promoting production reform. Some leaders dare not or are unwilling to criticize the shortcomings of labor models, which has led individual labor models to develop complacency, make slow political progress, and hinder their further progress in production. The fall of many labor models in the past was inseparable from the liberalism of the leadership.

The main reason why we have committed empiricist and conservative errors in industrial leadership is that many of our comrades do not attach importance to theoretical study. Many people have fallen into the quagmire of bureaucracy after entering factories and mines, spending their days in meetings and approving official documents, rarely or never systematically studying theory, and their current affairs studies are also very lax. This has resulted in political shortsightedness, making it impossible to see all the changes taking place around them. If you don't study, you will fall behind. How can you lead advanced production well with backward methods!

In order to effectively strengthen and improve our work, we plan to start in the following aspects:

I. Strengthen learning, adhere to the learning system, and tenaciously, conscientiously, and systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly eliminate the various influences of the bourgeoisie, in order to improve our theoretical level, ideological level, and leadership art level. Strengthen organizational life, carry out criticism and self-criticism within the Party, and resolutely oppose corrupt individualism.

II. Humbly and resolutely accept the advanced production experiences and advanced methods of other places, especially the Soviet Union, and conscientiously summarize, improve, and promote the advanced experiences and advanced methods of our own units. Experience summaries should be the responsibility of dedicated personnel. The Municipal Enterprise Management Committee and the Party committees of major factories and mines should pay close attention to ensuring the promotion of advanced experiences.

III. In business management, we must overcome blindness and the purely profit-seeking viewpoint, and pay attention to gradually implementing the economic accounting system.

IV. Further strengthen the education and transformation of technical personnel. To make technical personnel return to the team organizationally and ideologically, and achieve the combination of technology and labor.

V. Each member of the Municipal Party Committee should contact one factory, regularly go to the factory to understand the situation, help with work, and learn the knowledge and skills of leading industrial and mining work. Secondly, the work of the various departments at the municipal level should revolve around industrial and mining work. Facts have proven that the work of any department that deviates from industrial and mining production rarely achieves anything. In the future, we should pay attention to grasping the main work, and not attack on all sides, grabbing everything indiscriminately. Work should be arranged, inspected, and summarized. Every piece of work should have a beginning and an end, and should be carried through to the end, never giving up halfway.

    检查我们在领导工业方面的经验主义和保守主义倾向
    中共宣化市委员会
    入城以来，察哈尔省宣化市的绝大多数党员干部保持了坚苦朴素的作风，工作上也确实取得了一些成绩。但这些成绩赶不上客观形势的需要，其最本质的原因，是我们面对着簇新的城市工作特别是工人和工业工作，使用的方法依然是狭隘的经验主义和保守主义的方法。因为有很严重的经验主义，所以眼睛便不向前看，政治嗅觉很不灵敏，对新鲜事物没有敏锐感觉，思想之路很狭窄。很多同志成天在繁琐的事务圈子里打转，个别同志还显示过无知的狂妄，以为自己不知道或本地区没有的东西，好像世界上也没有；报纸上登载或上级通报了的先进生产方法，不敢大胆地试验推行，对本地工人群众的创造发明，也没有系统精密地加以分析、总结和推广，对工人群众的新创造、新纪录等宝贵成果，只知其然，不知其所以然。总之，因为我们长期存在着经验主义，以致生产上许多生动活泼的东西不能得到健康的发展。
    保守主义和经验主义倾向具体表现在以下几方面：
    一、外地的经验不能及时推广，本地的经验不能及时总结。有些厂矿在接受和推广先进经验上，畏首畏尾，强调困难，有的厂子竟说：“我厂生产任务小，用不着推广先进经验。”或者说：“那是苏联的，那是东北的，咱这里条件不具备，不能仿行。”更恶劣的是诿过于工人的“保守落后”，却不去加强领导。去年五月龙烟铁矿派人到北京学习高速切削法，回来后竟迟迟不推行；“三反”中工人们“反”了一下才开始推行。马万水的掘进铁矿先进经验，两年多未总结出来，直到这次中央钢铁工业局来人后，才进行了总结。刘福海的快速接车法和超轴满载安全运转、宝兴煤矿的安全生产、下花园发电厂的马应诚千日无事故和这次的快速检修、造纸厂的快速蒸煮、炼铁厂的几次出铁新纪录、矿务局在生产经营上的改革等经验，都没有认真地总结和推广。有的虽已做过总结，但只笼统地说几条“几快”“几勤”“几注意”，只能给人以模糊的印象，很难使人记取。有些厂矿的领导人不注意别处早已总结成文的经验，而在那里埋头乱找。有的领导人看不到或看不见本厂工人的小的创造，小的先进经验，认为“零碎点滴经验，不值得总结”。事实证明：先进的生产经验在宣化市各厂矿都有，而且是丰富的。这次中央钢铁工业局到庞家堡总结马万水的快速掘进法时，工程师们说：“马万水的各种操作技术和苏联的先进经验有许多环节都是相吻合的。”各厂矿所有的先进生产经验，没有很好地及时总结和推广，这都是由于领导方面存在着严重的经验主义和保守主义所造成的。
    二、在厂矿的领导工作中抓不住主要环节；或者有“单打一”的作风，顾此失彼，茫无头绪；或者因袭了过去农村工作中的“一揽子”的工作方法；或者事前不能作出周密的计划，只凭个人积累的点滴经验办事，在工作中缺乏预见性，缺乏科学的分析，因而抓不住运动规律，常常陷于被动。市委的领导有一般化的现象，市委同志不是经常深入厂矿研究政策的贯彻情况，提高领导艺术，而是空喊政治口号。对于经营管理、经济核算等业务至今学得很少。市委总结工作多是为了向上级作报告，不是为了切实指导各厂矿的实际工作。市委也曾开过不少的厂矿工作联席会议，由于会前准备不足，没有很好地通过会议来交流和总结经验。市里的某些直属部门（包括市委组织部、宣传部门在内）的工作，基本上没有冲破城圈。各厂矿的党务工作也很薄弱。
    三、依靠工人阶级的思想不明确，对工人合理化建议没有采取坚决支持的态度。厂矿领导方面如此，市委领导方面同样也没有真正深入到厂矿中去了解工人阶级的思想动态和意见，没有和工人同志们建立深厚的感情和友谊，没有把他们的意见提到议事日程上来认真讨论和研究，致使很多宝贵的合理化建议长期被埋没，这给生产造成的损失是难以计量的。另外对于劳动模范在推动生产改革上的积极意义，在认识上也是糊涂的。有的领导人对劳动模范的缺点不敢或不愿进行批评，以致个别劳动模范因此产生了自满情绪，政治上进步不快，阻碍了他们在生产上的再进步。过去有许多劳动模范所以垮台，和领导方面的自由主义是分不开的。
    我们在工业领导方面所以犯了经验主义和保守主义的错误，其主要的原因是因为我们有不少同志不重视理论学习。不少人进入厂矿以后便陷于事务主义的泥潭了，整日开会、批公事，很少或根本就没有系统地进行理论学习，时事学习也很松懈，这样就造成了政治上的短视，看不清周围所发生的一切变化。不学习便落后，以落后的方法来领导先进的生产，怎能领导得好呢！
    为了切实加强和改进我们的工作，我们打算从以下几方面着手：
    一、加强学习，坚持学习制度，顽强、认真、系统地学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，彻底肃清资产阶级的各种影响，以提高我们的理论水平、思想水平和领导艺术水平。加强组织生活，开展党内的批评和自我批评，坚决反对腐朽的个人主义。
    二、虚心地坚决地接受外地特别是苏联的生产先进经验和先进方法，认真地总结本单位的先进经验和先进方法，并加以提高和推广。总结经验应有专人负责，市企业管理委员会和各大厂矿党委应切实注意保证先进经验的推广。
    三、在经营管理上，要克服盲目性和单纯营利观点，注意逐步实行经济核算制。
    四、进一步加强对技术人员的教育和改造。使技术人员在组织上思想上归队，做到技术和劳动相结合。
    五、每个市委委员应联系一个厂子，经常下厂了解情况，帮助工作，学习领导工矿工作的知识和技能。其次是市级各部门的工作要围绕着工矿工作去进行。事实证明任何脱离工矿生产的部门工作是很少有所作为的。今后要注意抓住主要工作，不能四面出击，乱抓一把。进行工作要有布置，有检查，有总结，每件工作都要有始有终，一竿子插到底，决不半途而废。
