Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The work of the Indonesian people in preparing for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is intensifying, and more and more people from all walks of life are supporting the peace conference. At a recent Muslim prayer meeting, Indonesian Muslim Haji Usman said during a sermon: "Religion and peace are inseparable. For example, the United States is conducting germ warfare in Korea, which proves that the United States disregards humanity and religion. Therefore, we Muslims who love mankind must fight for peace. Without peace, we Muslims cannot have peace." Former Governor of Banten Province of Indonesia, Ahmad Hadib, recently said: It is written very clearly in the Quran: "Peace is the torch of mankind." Therefore, there is no distinction between Muslims and Christians in the cause of peace. Wei Hehe, chairman of the Yogyakarta Regional Council of Indonesia and member of the Central Committee of the Yogyakarta Regional Organization of the Masyumi Party, recently said in response to inquiries from the Indonesian Committee for the Defense of Peace: "Speaking of the peace conference to be held in Beijing, I believe that any cause for peace should receive the support and sympathy of all mankind." He also pointed out that peace is a necessary condition for saving mankind.

The Malang District Committee for the Defense of Peace in Indonesia held a meeting on August 11, attended by representatives from fifteen groups. The meeting resolved to convene a Malang regional conference to discuss the organizational issues of the Malang District Peace Committee. In addition, the Malang Regional Peace Conference Preparatory Committee, headed by the Indonesian General Labor Union, has been established.

    筹备亚洲及太平洋和平会议的工作日益开展
    印尼各阶层人民拥护和平会议者越来越多
    【新华社八日讯】印度尼西亚人民筹备亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的工作日益开展，各阶层人民拥护和平会议的越来越多。在最近举行的一个回教徒祈祷会上，印尼回教徒哈夷乌斯曼在讲经时说：“宗教与和平是不可分割的。例如：美国在朝鲜进行细菌战，证明了美国不顾人道和宗教。所以我们爱人类的回教徒必须为和平而斗争。如果没有和平，我们回教徒也不能得到平安。”印尼前万丹州州长艾哈迈德·哈迪布最近说：在可兰经里写得很明白：“和平是人类的火炬”，因此，在和平事业上没有回教徒和基督教徒的区别。印尼日惹地方议会会长、马斯友美党日惹地方组织中央委员韦禾荷最近在答复印尼保卫和平委员的询问时称：“谈到将在北京召开的和平会议，我认为，任何为了和平的事业，都应获得全人类的支持和同情。”他又指出：和平是拯救人类的必要条件。
    印尼玛琅区保卫和平委员会在八月十一日召开了会议，出席的有十五个团体的代表。会上决议召开玛琅区域会议讨论玛琅区和平委员会的组织问题。此外，以印尼总工会为首的玛琅区域和平会议筹备委员会已宣告成立。
