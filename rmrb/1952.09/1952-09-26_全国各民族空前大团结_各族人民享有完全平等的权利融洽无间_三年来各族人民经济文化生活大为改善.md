    [Report from this newspaper] Since the founding of the People's Republic of China three years ago, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, all nationalities in the country have achieved an unprecedented unity in history.
    China is a multi-ethnic country. Apart from the Han nationality, there are more than 60 minority nationalities, with a population of about 40 million. Successive reactionary rulers implemented barbaric policies of national oppression, engaged in incitement and division, and caused mutual discrimination and disunity among and within various nationalities. Since the national liberation, the People's Government has implemented correct ethnic policies, practiced ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance, and vigorously helped minority nationalities develop political, economic, and cultural construction, thus fundamentally changing the past ethnic relations. In particular, the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the reconciliation and unity of two Tibetan people's leaders—the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni—resolved problems that had not been solved for many years in history. This is a great victory of Chairman Mao's ethnic policy.
    In order to guarantee the equal rights of minority nationalities, the People's Government has promoted national regional autonomy in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities, established national democratic united governments in areas where various nationalities live in mixed communities, and also guaranteed that minority nationalities scattered in Han areas enjoy completely equal rights with the local Han people. As of June this year, 130 national autonomous regions and more than 200 national democratic united governments have been established throughout the country. In these areas, the unity among the various nationalities has been further strengthened. For example, Qiqihar Township, Buteha Banner, Huna League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is an area where Mongolians and Hans live in mixed communities. The Han people engage in agriculture, while the Mongolian people engage in animal husbandry. Before liberation, the Mongolian and Han peoples were deeply divided. After the establishment of the Autonomous Region People's Government, the estrangement gradually disappeared. The Han people taught the Mongolian people how to farm, and the Mongolian people taught the Han people how to raise livestock. The Mongolian and Han people also organized mutual aid teams to carry out production together.
    Before liberation, as a result of the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary rulers, the minority nationalities in China lived in extreme poverty, and their culture could not develop. In order to help minority nationalities improve their economic and cultural lives, the People's Government vigorously carried out trade, health work, and cultural and educational construction, and helped minority nationalities develop agriculture and animal husbandry. In some purely agricultural areas, in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the local minority nationality people and leaders who are connected with the people, and through cadres of their own nationality, rent reduction and interest reduction and land reform have been implemented. This has greatly improved the economic and cultural lives of the minority nationality people, and their political awareness has also been greatly enhanced.
    In order to strengthen national unity, the Central People's Government has successively sent four ethnic visiting delegations to visit minority nationality areas in the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, Northeast, and Inner Mongolia. Every year during the National Day celebrations, representatives of minority nationalities are invited to Beijing to attend the ceremonies. Minority nationalities in various places have also organized many tribute delegations and visiting groups to come to Beijing to pay tribute to Chairman Mao and to visit major cities. These representatives of minority nationalities have received enthusiastic welcome and cordial hospitality everywhere.
    Local people's governments have helped minority nationalities mediate many historical "enemy" disputes. According to incomplete statistics, in the two years after liberation in the Northwest region, more than 3,000 various disputes were mediated. In the year after the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang Province, more than 2,400 disputes were mediated. In the year or so after the establishment of the Zhaojue Yi Autonomous Region in the Daliang Mountains, more than 800 disputes between various branches of the Yi people were mediated. People of all ethnic groups held unity meetings everywhere, formulated patriotic unity pacts, and everywhere was filled with an atmosphere of friendship and unity.
    The People's Liberation Army and the staff of the People's Government who enter the minority nationality areas can respect the customs and religious beliefs of the minority nationalities and live in perfect harmony with the people of all ethnic groups. The People's Liberation Army entering Xinjiang vigorously carried out production and construction, opening canals, building roads, and helping the local people develop production, and was loved by the people of all ethnic groups. The People's Liberation Army entering Tibet helped the Tibetan people in production and labor and provided free medical treatment to the Tibetan people, and was affectionately called "New Hans" by the Tibetan people.
    The people of all ethnic groups in the country love their motherland and love peace. In the past three years, the people of all ethnic groups have enthusiastically participated in various movements to defend peace, signed the Stockholm Appeal, signed in support of the conclusion of a peace treaty by the five major powers, voted against the United States arming Japan, and opposed the US aggressors launching bacteriological warfare. Especially in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, all ethnic groups have sent their outstanding sons and daughters to participate in the Chinese People's Volunteers, and enthusiastically donated weapons to support the Volunteers and fight against the US aggressors. The people of all ethnic groups in China will further unite to defend world peace.

    全国各民族空前大团结
    各族人民享有完全平等的权利融洽无间
    三年来各族人民经济文化生活大为改善
    【本报讯】中华人民共和国成立三年以来，国内各民族在毛主席的英明领导下，实现了历史上空前未有的大团结。
    中国是个多民族的国家，汉族以外，有少数民族六十多个，人口约四千万人。历代的反动统治者都实行野蛮的民族压迫政策，进行挑拨离间，使各民族间和各民族内部互相歧视，互不团结。全国解放以来，人民政府执行了正确的民族政策，实行民族平等、团结互助，大力帮助少数民族发展政治、经济、文化建设事业，因而根本改变了过去的民族关系。特别是西藏的和平解放，两位藏族人民领袖——达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼重新和好团结，解决了历史上多少年来没有解决的问题。这是毛主席的民族政策的伟大胜利。
    人民政府为保障少数民族的平等权利，在少数民族聚居地区推行民族区域自治，在各民族杂居地区建立民族民主联合政府，对散居在汉族地区的少数民族成分，也保障了他们与当地汉族人民享有完全平等的权利。截至今年六月份止，全国各地已建立一百三十个民族自治区和二百多个民族民主联合政府。在这些地区，各民族间的团结更加增强。如内蒙古自治区呼纳盟布特哈旗的齐齐哈尔乡，是一个蒙汉杂居地区。汉族人民经营农业，蒙族人民经营牧业。解放前，蒙汉两族人民隔阂很深。自治区人民政府成立以后，隔阂逐渐消除，汉族人民教蒙族人民种地，蒙族人民教汉族人民饲养牲畜。蒙汉人民还组织了换工组，共同进行生产。
    解放以前，中国少数民族受反动统治者剥削压迫的结果，生活极为贫困，文化不能发展。人民政府为帮助少数民族改善经济生活和文化生活，大力开展了贸易、卫生工作和文化教育建设事业，并帮助少数民族发展农业、牧业。在部分纯农业地区，根据当地少数民族大多数人民和与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿，通过其本民族的干部，已经实行了减租减息和土地改革。这使少数民族人民的经济和文化生活大大改善，政治觉悟也大大提高。
    为了加强民族团结，中央人民政府曾先后派出四个民族访问团，到西北、西南、中南、东北及内蒙古等少数民族地区进行访问。每年国庆盛典，都邀请少数民族代表来京观礼。各地少数民族也组织了许多致敬团和参观团，到北京来向毛主席致敬，并到各大城市参观。这些少数民族代表，到处都受到了热烈的欢迎和亲切的招待。
    各地人民政府曾帮助少数民族调解了许多历史上的“冤家”纠纷。据不完全统计，西北地区解放后两年的时间，即调解了各种纠纷三千余件。西康省藏族自治区成立后一年之中，调解了纠纷二千四百余件。大凉山地区的昭觉彝族自治区成立后一年多的时间，调解了彝族各支头间的纠纷八百多件。各族人民到处召开了团结会议，订立了爱国团结公约，到处洋溢着友爱团结的气氛。
    进入少数民族地区的人民解放军和人民政府的工作人员，都能尊重少数民族的风俗习惯和宗教信仰，和各族人民融洽无间。进入新疆的人民解放军，大力开展生产建设，开水渠、修公路，帮助当地人民发展生产，受到各族人民的热爱。进入西藏的人民解放军，帮助藏族人民生产劳动，给藏族人民免费治病，被藏族人民亲切地称为“新汉人”。
    全国各民族人民都热爱自己的祖国，热爱和平。三年来各族人民热烈参加了各种保卫和平的运动，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，签名拥护五大国缔结和平公约、投票反对美国武装日本，反对美国侵略者发动细菌战。特别在抗美援朝运动中，各族人民都曾派遣他们的优秀儿女参加了中国人民志愿军，并踊跃捐献武器，支援志愿军，打击美国侵略者。中国各族人民将进一步团结起来，保卫世界和平。
