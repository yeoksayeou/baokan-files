    The Scientific and Revolutionary Nature of Marxist Dialectics
    —Notes on Studying "On Contradiction"
    Hu Sheng
    Marxist dialectics, in accordance with the nature of things, recognizes the inherent contradictions of things, studies the laws of development of contradictions in various things, and thereby finds the correct methods to resolve contradictions. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction": When studying any contradiction, "do not bring any subjective arbitrariness"; "the contradiction we are talking about is a real contradiction, a concrete contradiction"; "what scientifically reflects the identity of real changes is Marxist dialectics."
    The complete laws of contradiction development in real life are not exposed on the surface for people to easily capture. As "On Practice" says, "In the process of practice, people initially only see the phenomenal aspects of various things in the process, see the one-sidedness of various things, and see the external connections between various things." Only when reaching rational knowledge can one "reach a gradual understanding of the internal contradictions of objective things." Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Rational knowledge takes a big step forward, reaching the whole, the essence, the internal connections of things, reaching the exposure of the internal contradictions of the surrounding world, and thus being able to grasp the development of the surrounding world in its entirety, in the internal connections of all aspects of the surrounding world."
    Metaphysics denies the inherent contradictions in objective reality and denies the unity of opposites. This is because metaphysics only stays at the superficial and shallow understanding of things. Marxist dialectics is a profound and scientific reflection of the real world.
    The metaphysical viewpoint is directly related to the conservative and reactionary stance in social history. In the struggle of contradictions, the struggle between the new and the old, those who stand on the conservative and reactionary side, fearing to expose contradictions, often use metaphysics as a talisman to deceive people and prevent the development of history.
    From this, it can be seen that the scientific viewpoint of Marxism, which dares to profoundly expose all internal contradictions from objective reality, cannot but be directly related to the revolutionary stance.
    Without thorough revolutionary spirit, there is no thorough scientific spirit. This is a major reason why dialectics before Marxism was always incomplete. "On Contradiction" says: "Ancient dialectics had a spontaneous and naive nature. Based on the social and historical conditions at that time, it was impossible to have a complete theory, and therefore it could not fully explain the universe." This was limited by the incompleteness of ancient scientific thought on the one hand, and by the limitations of social class position on the other hand. For example, ancient Chinese Taoist thought contained naive and incomplete dialectical ideas. They understood the principle that opposite factors are interdependent and mutually transform. They saw that real things are not simple, but have various contradictions and struggles. However, they regarded all this as a tragic fate in the human world. They tried to retreat to a primitive state to avoid all contradictions and struggles. They thought: since there is good, there will be evil; if there is benefit, there will be harm; if there is gain, there will be loss. Then, if we do not seek good or benefit, and do not seek to gain anything, we will not encounter the struggle between good and evil, the struggle between benefit and harm, and we will not lose anything.
    Liang Qichao, one of the earliest reformists in modern China, was basically a metaphysical idealist, but he experienced the period when feudal society began to disintegrate and the bourgeois revolution began to launch. He could not but acknowledge this huge historical change. In 1901, he said: "At the moment of the intersection of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the two different natures of China are powerfully fighting against each other, in close combat, and it is the time of the succession of the new and the old." [Note 1] In this way, he saw the struggle between the new and the old contradictions in Chinese society at that time, although he could not specifically explain the two major forces representing the new and the old contradictions. But what attitude did he take towards this struggle between the new and the old contradictions? In another article he wrote in 1902, he said: "The phenomena of everything in the world are nothing more than two major doctrines, one is conservatism and the other is progress. People who use these two doctrines either prefer A or prefer B; or both rise together and conflict with each other, or both coexist and harmonize with each other. Preferring only one, none can stand.
    Where there is conflict, there must be harmony. Conflict is the forerunner of harmony." [Note 2]
    On the one hand, he acknowledged the contradictions and the struggle of contradictions, but on the other hand, he believed that the struggle of contradictions must result in harmony. The result of the struggle of contradictions is not a thorough solution, but the implementation of harmony between the new and the old. This is precisely Liang Qichao's ideological contradiction at that time, and this contradiction explains why he was a reformist.
    Of course, this view of treating contradictions as a tragic fate and thinking that contradictions can be avoided by retreating, and the view that the result of the struggle of contradictions is harmony, are completely unrelated to Marxism. Because contradictions are a real existence, they do not disappear because people do not acknowledge them, so people who are afraid of exposing contradictions are sometimes forced to acknowledge contradictions. It is natural that they cannot thoroughly and scientifically explain the complete laws of contradiction development.
    Since internal contradiction is the fundamental driving force for the forward development of things, if people do not look forward to and support the forward development of social history without any hesitation, they will inevitably either refuse to acknowledge contradictions, or helplessly acknowledge certain contradictions, and after acknowledging contradictions, still fantasize about avoiding contradictions or attempting to guide contradictions towards harmony.
    Stalin said: "In the opinion of dialectics, what is most important is not what at the present moment seems to be durable and yet is already beginning to die away, but what is arising and developing, even though at the present moment it may appear to be not durable, for in the opinion of dialectics, only that which is arising and developing is invincible." [Note 3] If people do not closely rely on the new and developing things in any situation in their practical stance, they cannot but feel uneasy in the face of the dialectics of the objective world.
    ×××
    Only the standpoint of the revolutionary proletariat is completely consistent with the dialectics of the objective world. Because the proletariat itself is in the most advanced position in the history of human class struggle, and is a class that can open up unlimited development prospects for human history. Starting from the standpoint of the revolutionary proletariat, we always look forward, not backward, in the stream of development and change in the real world. In the struggle between new and old contradictions, we always stand on the side of the newborn and rely on the side of the newborn. Therefore, we can unhesitatingly acknowledge the universality or absoluteness of contradictions, that is, as "On Contradiction" points out, acknowledge that "contradictions exist in the development process of all things," and acknowledge that "in the development process of each thing, there is a contradictory movement from beginning to end."
    Marxism, of course, does not "create" contradictions deliberately because it "likes" contradictions, as some people who distort Marxism say. The actual contradictions in real life cannot be created by people. However, Marxism does not regard contradictions as a tragic fate or a terrible thing in any situation.
    "On Contradiction" quotes Engels's words: "Life itself is a constantly self-generating and self-resolving contradiction present in things and processes, and as soon as this contradiction ceases, life, too, ceases, and death ensues." "On Contradiction" says about ideological struggle within the Communist Party: "The opposition and struggle of different ideas within the Party is constantly occurring, which is a reflection of social class contradictions and the contradictions between new and old things within the Party. If there are no contradictions and no ideological struggle to resolve contradictions within the Party, the life of the Party will also cease." In the eyes of Marxists, the contradictions in the universe will not disappear, because the absolute elimination of contradictions precisely means the absolute cessation of movement and the extinction of life. The appearance of actual contradictions in real life precisely expresses the vitality of life, expresses that things are in forward movement, and expresses that the existing contradictions will be resolved, and the old process will be replaced by the new process.
    Marxism can observe all contradictions and expose all contradictions with thorough scientific spirit because it is based on the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.
    From this, it can be seen that the task of Marxism is not only limited to truthfully explaining contradictions, but more importantly, to resolve contradictions according to the laws of contradiction development. If one only passively acknowledges objective contradictions, that is not Marxism. "On Practice" says: "Marxist philosophy believes that the most important problem is not to understand the laws of the objective world and thus be able to explain the world, but to use this understanding of objective laws to actively transform the world." Because Marxism most faithfully reflects the laws of development of real contradictions, it can make its actions conform to objective laws, and it can not be passively dominated by objective contradictions, but stand on the side of the newborn in the contradictions to correctly and sequentially resolve the contradictions.
    Taking social class contradiction as an example, it is of course absurd to fundamentally deny class contradiction, but is it Marxism to merely acknowledge class contradiction? Lenin said: "He who recognizes only the class struggle is not yet a Marxist; he may be found to be still within the bounds of bourgeois thinking and bourgeois politics. To confine Marxism to the doctrine of the class struggle means curtailing Marxism, distorting it, reducing it to something acceptable to the bourgeoisie. Only he is a Marxist who extends the recognition of the class struggle to the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat." [Note 4]
    This means that Marxists not only acknowledge class contradictions, but also dare to expose and unfold class struggle from the revolutionary standpoint of the proletariat, pushing the class struggle forward until the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the establishment of a socialist society, and finally the thorough resolution of class contradictions in human history.
    Marxism attaches importance to the role of revolution in historical development, which is related to the Marxist view that the recognition of contradiction must be extended to the resolution of contradiction. Lenin said: "Marx's attitude of attaching great importance to the revolutionary periods in human development stems from the sum total of his historical views, because he believes that the countless contradictions slowly accumulated during the so-called period of peaceful development can only be resolved in such periods." [Note 5]
    Bringing the scientific study of contradictions in the real world to the resolution of contradictions and making specific scientific research on the methods of resolving contradictions is the manifestation of the revolutionary nature of Marxist dialectics. Lenin said: "Marx considered the value of his theory to lie entirely in the fact that this theory 'is fundamentally a critical and revolutionary theory.' The latter nature is truly and absolutely the unique characteristic of Marxism, because this theory directly recognizes its own task as exposing all antagonistic and exploitative forms of present society, examining its evolution, proving its temporary nature and the necessity of its transformation into another form, and thereby also helping the proletariat to eliminate any exploitation as quickly and easily as possible." [Note 6]
    It is obvious that the characteristics of Marxist criticality and revolutionary spirit are also brilliantly manifested in Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction." "On Contradiction" says: "This dialectical worldview mainly teaches people to be good at observing and analyzing the contradictory movements of various things, and based on this analysis, pointing out the methods of resolving contradictions." And it says: "The task of the Communists is to expose the erroneous ideas of the reactionaries and metaphysics, publicize the original dialectics of things, promote the transformation of things, and achieve the goal of revolution."
    ×××
    Of course, the meaning of the resolution of contradiction mentioned by Marxism cannot be understood as the reconciliation of contradiction or the absolute elimination of contradiction.
    Contradictions cannot be resolved by reconciliation. Although some contradictory things may maintain a state of harmony under certain conditions, this is a relative and temporary state. "On Contradiction" says, "The movement of anything always takes two states, a relatively stationary state and a significantly changing state." When things are in a relatively stationary state, that is, contradictory things are in a state of unity, solidarity, alliance, harmony, etc. In this state, contradictory things do not have no struggle, but the struggle has not yet entered the superficial intensification. Things are not absolutely static, but are undergoing quantitative gradual changes: therefore, this is not the resolution of contradiction, but the contradiction has not yet developed to a degree that can be resolved. The relatively stationary state will inevitably develop into a significantly changing state, the unity, solidarity, alliance, harmony, etc. of contradictions will inevitably develop into the decomposition and rupture of contradictions, and quantitative changes will inevitably develop into qualitative changes; only in this way can the resolution of contradictions be realized. "On Contradiction" says: "Things are constantly transformed from the first state to the second state, and the struggle of contradictions exists in the two states and reaches the resolution of contradictions through the second state."
    This is what Stalin said, "The process of development proceeds through the disclosure of internal contradictions, through collisions between opposing forces on the basis of these contradictions, and designed to overcome these contradictions." [Note 7]
    It is obvious that recognizing this point is of great significance for the revolutionary practice of the proletariat. Adventurists subjectively and rashly attempt to resolve objective contradictions all at once when the conditions for resolving them are not yet available. Marxism-Leninism opposes this adventurist tendency, but at the same time never regards the temporary reconciliation of contradictions as the resolution of contradictions, never imagines resolving contradictions in the reconciliation of contradictions, but reveals and develops contradictions according to the laws of development of things themselves, and resolves contradictions in the struggle of contradictions. If people do not do this, they will degenerate into the quagmire of opportunism and reformism.
    Resolving contradictions is not absolutely eliminating contradictions. The old contradictions in the old process are resolved, and the new contradictions in the new process begin accordingly. "On Contradiction" says: "What is the occurrence of a new process? It is the old unity and the opposing components that make up this unity giving way to the new unity and the opposing components that make up this unity, so the new process replaces the old process and occurs. The old process is over, and the new process has occurred. The new process also contains new contradictions, and begins its own history of contradictory development."
    Taking the Chinese revolution as an example. The revolutionary war won victory throughout the country, and a unified people's regime appeared. This is the result of resolving a series of old contradictions. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "But we still have many things to do. For example, when walking, the past work is only like the first step of a long march. The remaining enemies are still waiting for us to wipe them out. Serious economic construction tasks are placed before us. Some of the things we are familiar with will soon be idle, and the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do. This is the difficulty." [Note 8] Just in terms of our party life, the great victory of the revolution shows, on the one hand, that the cause of our party has made great progress, and on the other hand, that new problems will also occur within our party. This is what the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party pointed out: "Because of victory, the arrogance of the party, the mood of considering oneself as a meritorious minister, the mood of stagnation and not seeking progress, and the mood of coveting pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life may grow." All these precisely illustrate that with the emergence of the new process, various new contradictions and new problems are placed before us and need to be resolved by us.
    It is obvious that recognizing that the resolution of contradictions is not the absolute elimination of contradictions, and acknowledging that the development process of the real world is the infinite succession of new and old contradictions, is of great significance for the revolutionary practice of the proletariat.
    If people cannot see that the resolution of old contradictions is the emergence of new contradictions, people will fall into a conservative and reactionary position in the development of the new process, and be crushed by the newly arisen contradictions. The bourgeoisie is like this. It can acknowledge the contradiction between capitalism and feudalism, but after this contradiction is resolved by the victory of the bourgeoisie, it thinks that there are no new contradictions in social development. The proletariat, on the contrary, regards the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution as only a transition to the socialist revolution. This is why we criticize the view that the revolution has won and everything is fine as belonging to the bourgeois viewpoint.
    There is a vulgar proverb that says: "It is better to do one less thing than to do one more thing." The reason is that although "doing one more thing" is good, it also adds new troubles. This is to treat the facts with a conservative and reactionary view. According to this view, although the victory of the revolution is a good thing, new contradictions and new "troubles" have emerged, so it is better not to have victory.
    The revolutionary proletariat is not afraid of any new "troubles," not afraid of any new problems and new contradictions, and on the contrary, it must be good at using Marxism-Leninism, and when the old contradictions are resolved, it has already keenly seen the new problems and difficulties that have newly occurred in the new process, seen the difficulties in the progress, and is always ready to overcome the difficulties. Marxism makes people always look forward firmly, always ready to solve the next contradiction in the development of the new process after solving the previous contradiction. Here, the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat is most fully expressed.
    ×××
    Comrade Mao Zedong particularly emphasized the issue of the particularity of contradictions in "On Contradiction." This is because studying the particularity of contradictions in current concrete things is of great significance for guiding revolutionary practice.
    Dogmatists do not understand the interconnectedness of the universality of contradictions and the particularity of contradictions. They refuse to study the particularity of contradictions, and therefore can only make abstract and seemingly correct explanations for all kinds of concrete things, which cannot stand the test of practice. Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On Contradiction," "Contradictions of different qualities can only be resolved by methods of different qualities." Comrade Mao Zedong went on to say:
    "Using different methods to solve different contradictions is a principle that Marxists-Leninists must strictly abide by. Dogmatists do not abide by this principle. They do not understand the differences in various revolutionary situations, and therefore do not understand that different methods should be used to solve different contradictions, but simply use one formula that they think is unchangeable and apply it everywhere, which can only make the revolution suffer setbacks, or make things that were originally done well very bad."
    On the other hand, empiricists similarly did not see the various connections of the internal and external contradictions of things, but only grasped certain branches of the contradictions one-sidedly and in isolation, so empiricists cannot have a comprehensive understanding of things. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Only seeing the part, not seeing the whole, only seeing the trees, not seeing the forest. In this way, it is impossible to find a way to resolve contradictions, it is impossible to complete revolutionary tasks, it is impossible to do the assigned work well, and it is impossible to correctly develop ideological struggle within the Party."
    In the ideological remolding movement, we can experience this situation. There are various specific manifestations of erroneous ideological tendencies. In order to deeply understand the essence of erroneous ideas and find ways to overcome them, it is necessary to conduct correct generalization through superficially complex phenomena and point out its class roots. Class analysis is the most profound analysis, because reaching class analysis is to reveal the essential contradictions of social historical phenomena.
    However, when we actually conduct ideological struggle, we must never be satisfied with merely generally pointing out class nature. In criticism and self-criticism, people are not satisfied with using explanations of "petty-bourgeois ideology," "bourgeois exploitation concepts," etc. to replace concrete analysis, not because this general concept is not applicable, but because if this general concept is not enriched with concrete analysis, the problem cannot be solved. For example, petty-bourgeois ideology, in this person, manifests itself as revolutionary fanaticism with an anarchist tendency, in another person it mainly manifests itself as selfish and self-interested concepts, and in a third person it can manifest itself as narrow conservative ideas.
    Dogmatism refuses to conduct concrete analysis of concrete things, thus making itself incompetent in practice. Empiricists only see some individual phenomena of things, but lack an understanding of the essence of things, so they cannot truly scientifically analyze and study concrete things, and they cannot but run into walls in practice.
    Comrade Mao Zedong further elaborated on the significance of recognizing the particularity of contradictions for revolutionary practice when studying major contradictions and major aspects of contradictions.
    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's argument, major contradictions and major aspects of contradictions will change due to specific times, places, and conditions. Even basic principles of materialism such as productive forces determine production relations, practice determines theory, and the economic base determines the superstructure do not preclude production relations, theory, and the superstructure from becoming the main determining things under certain conditions.
    When studying "On Contradiction," some people misunderstood the relationship between external causes and internal causes. They thought that since external causes play a role through internal causes, and internal causes are the basis of change, external causes cannot play a decisive role in the change of things under any circumstances. This absolute view is not a dialectical understanding of the relationship between basis and conditions, and the relationship between internal causes and external causes. The basis plays a major role in the development of things regularly, but when the basis is already available, but a certain change cannot be realized due to the lack of a certain condition, the emergence of a certain internal or external condition becomes the decisive factor in promoting this change. This is precisely the dialectics in real life.
    Whether people analyze contradictions and study contradictions from specific times, places, and conditions determines whether people regard Marxism as a dogmatic formula or as a weapon of revolutionary practice.
    Lenin once pointed out: "Our—Engels said of himself and his famous friend—doctrine is not a dogma, but a guide to action. This typical definition sharply and powerfully emphasizes an aspect of Marxism that is often overlooked. Neglecting this aspect will turn Marxism into a one-sided, deformed, and lifeless thing, will cut out the living soul of Marxism, will destroy its fundamental theoretical basis of dialectics, that is, the doctrine of all-encompassing and contradictory historical development, and will break its connection with certain practical era tasks that change with each new transformation of history." [Note 9]
    Stalin pointed out: "Marxism in its development cannot but be enriched by new experience and new knowledge—and therefore its individual formulas and conclusions cannot but change with time and cannot but be replaced by new formulas and conclusions adapted to new historical tasks. Marxism does not recognize immutable conclusions and formulas that are absolutely adapted to all times and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism." [Note 10]
    Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant philosophical work "On Contradiction" is precisely to expound the dialectical theory of Marxism-Leninism as a revolutionary weapon of the proletariat.
    In "On Practice," Comrade Mao Zedong taught: "Marxist philosophy, dialectical materialism, has two most prominent characteristics: one is its class nature, openly stating that dialectical materialism serves the proletariat; the other is its practicality, emphasizing the dependence of theory on practice, the foundation of theory is practice, and it in turn serves practice." When we study "On Contradiction," we must also firmly grasp these two characteristics. Marxist dialectics is the revolutionary and critical theory of the proletariat; if you don't see it this way, you can't understand "On Contradiction."

    马克思主义辩证法的科学性和革命性
    ——学习“矛盾论”笔记
    胡绳
    马克思主义的辩证法按照事物的本性而承认事物的内在矛盾，研究各种事物矛盾的发展规律，并从而找出解决矛盾的正确方法。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中说：在研究任何矛盾时，“不要带上任何的主观随意性”；“我们所说的矛盾乃是现实的矛盾、具体的矛盾”；“科学地反映现实变化的同一性的，就是马克思主义的辩证法。”
    现实生活中的矛盾发展的全部规律并不是露在表面上，让人们很容易地就捕捉到的。如同“实践论”中所说，“人在实践过程中，开始只是看到过程中各个事物的现象方面，看到各个事物的片面，看到各个事物之间的外部联系。”只有到达论理的认识时，才“到达于逐步了解客观事物的内部矛盾”。毛泽东同志说：“论理的认识则推进了一大步，到达了事物的全体的、本质的、内部联系的东西，到达了暴露周围世界的内在的矛盾，因而能在周围世界的总体上，在周围世界一切方面的内部联系上去把握周围世界的发展。”
    形而上学否认客观现实中的内在矛盾，否认对立物的统一，这就因为形而上学只是停留在对事物的表面的、浮浅的认识上。马克思主义的辩证法则是现实世界的深刻的科学的反映。
    形而上学的观点是和在社会历史上的保守和反动的立场直接相联系着的。在矛盾的斗争、新和旧的斗争中，站在保守和反动立场上的人，由于害怕揭穿矛盾，就常常以形而上学为护符，在人们中进行欺骗，来阻止历史的发展。
    由此可见，敢于从客观现实中深刻地暴露一切内在矛盾的马克思主义的科学观点，不能不和革命的立场直接相联系。
    没有彻底的革命性，就没有彻底的科学性，这就是为什么在马克思主义以前的辩证法总是不完备的一个主要原因。“矛盾论”中说：“古代的辩证法带着自发的朴素的性质，根据当时的社会历史条件，还不可能有完备的理论，因而不能完全解释宇宙”。这一方面是受了古代的科学思想的不完备的限制，一方面也是受了社会阶级立场的限制。例如中国古代的道家思想中就包含着朴素的不完备的辩证法思想。他们懂得相反的因素互相依存、互相转化的道理。他们看出现实的事物并不是单纯的，而是有各种矛盾斗争的。但是他们把这一切看做是人类世界中的可悲的命运。他们企图退避到一种原始的境地，以避免一切矛盾斗争。他们想：既然有善就会有恶，有利就会有弊，有所得就会有所失，那么，我们根本不求善求利，不求有所得，也就不会遇到善与恶的斗争，利与弊的斗争了，也就不会有所失了。
    中国近代最早的改良主义者之一梁启超基本上是个形而上学的唯心论者，但他经历着封建社会开始解体，资产阶级革命开始发动的时期，也不能不承认这种巨大的历史变动。在一九○一年，他说：“十九世纪与二十世纪交点之一刹那顷，实中国两异性之大动力相搏相射，短兵紧接，而新陈嬗代之时也。”〔注一〕这样子，他是看出了当时中国社会中新与旧的矛盾的斗争，虽然他不能具体说明这代表新旧矛盾的两大势力。但是他对于这种新旧矛盾的斗争采取什么态度呢？在他的一九○二年所写的另一篇文章中，他说：“世界上万事之现象，不外两大主义，一曰保守，二曰进取。人之运用此两主义者，或偏取甲，或偏取乙；或两者并起而相冲突，或两者并存而相调和。偏取其一，未有能立者也。
    有冲突则必有调和，冲突者，调和之先驱也。”〔注二〕
    一方面承认了矛盾和矛盾的斗争，另一方面又认为矛盾的斗争必须以调和为结果，矛盾斗争的结果并不是得到彻底的解决，而是在新与旧之间实行调和，这正是梁启超当时在思想上的矛盾，而这种矛盾也就说明了他的所以为改良主义者。
    当然，这种把矛盾当作可悲的命运，并认为可以用退缩的办法来逃避矛盾的看法，和这种认为矛盾斗争的结果就是调和的看法，是跟马克思主义毫不相干的。正因为矛盾是现实存在，它并不因人们的不承认而消失，所以害怕揭露矛盾的人有时也会被迫地承认矛盾。他们不能够彻底地科学地说明矛盾发展的全部规律是很自然的事。
    既然内在的矛盾是事物向前发展的根本动力，人们如果不是毫无顾虑地展望和拥护社会历史的向前发展，那么就不可免地会或者是拒绝承认矛盾，或者是无可奈何地承认某种矛盾，而在承认矛盾之后，仍旧幻想回避矛盾或企图把矛盾引导向调和。
    斯大林说：“在辩证法看来，最重要的不是现时似乎坚固，但已经开始衰亡的东西，而是正在产生，正在发展的东西，那怕它现时似乎还不坚固，因为在辩证法看来，只有正在产生，正在发展的东西，才是不可战胜的。”〔注三〕人们在实践立场上如果并不是在任何情况下都紧紧依靠着新生的发展的东西，那就不能不在客观世界的辩证法前面感到惶恐不安。
    ×××
    只有革命的无产阶级的立场才是和客观世界的辩证法完全一致。因为无产阶级本身就是在人类阶级斗争历史中处于最先进的地位，并且是能够为人类历史开辟无限发展前途的一个阶级。从革命的无产阶级立场出发，我们在现实世界的发展变化之流中永远是向前看，而不是向后看，在新与旧的矛盾斗争中，永远站在新生的一方面，依靠着新生的一方面。因此我们就能够毫不迟疑地承认矛盾的普遍性或绝对性，就是如同“矛盾论”所指明的，承认“矛盾存在于一切事物的发展过程中”，而且承认“每一事物的发展过程中存在着自始至终的矛盾运动。”
    马克思主义当然不是如有些曲解马克思主义的人所说，因为“喜欢”矛盾而故意“制造”矛盾。实际生活中的实际矛盾并不是人们所可以制造出来的。但是马克思主义的确在任何情况下都不认为矛盾是可悲的命运或可怕的事情。
    “矛盾论”中引用了恩格斯的话：“生命也是存在于物体和过程本身中的不断地自行产生并自行解决的矛盾；这一矛盾一停止，生命亦即停止，于是死就来到。”“矛盾论”中关于共产党内的思想斗争说：“党内不同思想的对立和斗争是经常发生的，这是社会的阶级矛盾和新旧事物的矛盾在党内的反映。党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”在马克思主义者看来，宇宙中的矛盾是不会消灭的，因为矛盾的绝对消灭正是意味着运动的绝对停止，生命的绝灭。实际生活中的实际的矛盾的出现恰恰是表现着生命的活跃，表现着事物在前进运动中，表现着现存的矛盾将要被解决，旧的过程将要为新的过程所代替。
    马克思主义能够以彻底的科学性来观察一切矛盾，揭发一切矛盾，就因为它是以无产阶级的彻底的革命性为基础的原故。
    由此可见，马克思主义的任务不仅限于要如实地说明矛盾，更重要的是要根据矛盾的发展规律来解决矛盾。如果只是被动地承认客观的矛盾，那并不就是马克思主义。“实践论”中说：“马克思主义的哲学认为十分重要的问题，不在于懂得了客观世界的规律性，因而能够解释世界，而在于拿了这种客观规律性的认识去能动地改造世界。”马克思主义因为是最忠实地反映了现实的矛盾的发展规律，所以就能够使自己的行动符合于客观的规律，就能够不是消极地受客观矛盾的支配，而是站在矛盾中的新生的一方面来正确地并循序地解决矛盾。
    以社会阶级矛盾来说，根本否认阶级矛盾当然是荒谬的，但是仅仅承认阶级矛盾是不是马克思主义呢？列宁说：“谁仅仅承认阶级斗争，那他还不是马克思主义者，他还可以是没有离开资产阶级思想和资产阶级政策范围的人。以阶级斗争学说来限制马克思主义，便是割裂马克思主义，曲解马克思主义，使它成为资产阶级所可接受的东西。只有把承认阶级斗争扩展到承认无产阶级专政的人，才是马克思主义者。”〔注四〕
    这就是说，马克思主义者不仅承认阶级矛盾，而且敢于站在无产阶级革命立场上暴露和展开阶级斗争，把阶级斗争向前推进一直到建立无产阶级专政，建立社会主义社会，最后彻底地解决人类历史中的阶级矛盾。
    马克思主义重视革命在历史发展中的作用，这和马克思主义一定要把承认矛盾扩展至解决矛盾的观点是相联系的。列宁说：“马克思非常重视人类发展中革命时期的态度是从他的全部历史观点总和中产生出来的，因为他认为由所谓和平发展时期慢慢积累起来的无数矛盾只有在这样的时期才能得到解决。”〔注五〕
    把对现实世界中的矛盾的科学研究归结到矛盾的解决，并对解决矛盾的方法作具体的科学研究，这就是马克思主义的辩证法的革命性的表现。列宁说：“马克思认为他的理论底价值全在于这个理论‘根本上就是批判的和革命的理论’。后一性质，真正而且绝对是马克思主义特具的本色，因为这个理论直接认定它自己的任务是要暴露现社会所有一切对抗和剥削形态，考察其进化情形，证明其暂时性质及转变为另一种形态的必然性，因而也就帮助无产阶级尽量迅速，尽量容易地消灭任何剥削。”〔注六〕
    很明显的，在毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”中，也光辉地表现着马克思主义的批判性和革命性的特点。“矛盾论”中说：“这个辩证法的宇宙观，主要地就是教导人们要善于去观察和分析各种事物的矛盾的运动，并根据这种分析，指出解决矛盾的方法。”并且说：“共产党人的任务就在于揭露反动派和形而上学的错误思想，宣传事物的本来的辩证法，促成事物的转化，达到革命的目的。”

    当然不能把马克思主义所说的矛盾的解决的意思了解为矛盾的调和或矛盾的绝对消灭。
    矛盾是不可以用调和的办法来解决的。有些矛盾的东西虽然也会在一定的条件下保持调和的状态，但这是相对的暂时的状态。“矛盾论”中说，“无论什么事物的运动都采取两种状态，相对地静止的状态和显著地变动的状态。”事物处于相对地静止的状态，也就是矛盾的东西处于统一、团结、联合、调和等等的状态。在这种状态下，矛盾的东西并不是没有斗争，而是斗争还没有进到表面上的激化，事物并不是绝对静止，而是在进行着数量的渐变：所以这也并不是矛盾的解决，而是矛盾还没有发展成熟到可以解决的程度。相对地静止的状态必然要发展到显著地变动的状态，矛盾的统一、团结、联合、调和等等必然要发展到矛盾的分解和破裂，数量的变化必然要发展到质量的变化；只有这样才能实现矛盾的解决。“矛盾论”中说：“事物总是不断地由第一种状态转化为第二种状态，而矛盾的斗争则存在于两种状态中，并经过第二种状态而达到矛盾的解决。”
    这也就是斯大林所说的，“发展过程是经过内在矛盾的揭露，是经过基于这些矛盾的彼此对立势力冲突来克服这些矛盾而进行的”。〔注七〕
    很明显的，认清这一点，对于无产阶级的革命实践是有重大意义的。盲动主义者在解决客观矛盾的条件还没有具备的时候，就主观地鲁莽地企图一下子加以解决。马克思列宁主义反对这种盲动主义的倾向，同时又绝不把矛盾的暂时调和看做矛盾的解决，绝不设想在矛盾的调和中解决矛盾，而要按照事物本身的发展规律揭露和发展矛盾，在矛盾的斗争中解决矛盾。人们如果不这样做，就会使自己堕落到机会主义和改良主义的泥坑。
    解决矛盾并不是绝对地消灭矛盾。旧过程中的旧矛盾解决了，新过程中的新矛盾又随之而开始。“矛盾论”中说：“新过程的发生是什么呢？这是旧的统一和组成此统一的对立成份让位于新的统一和组成此统一的对立成份，于是新过程就代替旧过程而发生。旧过程完结了，新过程发生了。新过程又包含着新矛盾，开始它自己的矛盾发展史。”
    以中国革命为例。革命战争在全国胜利，统一的人民政权出现。这是解决了一系列的旧的矛盾的结果。毛泽东同志说：“但是我们的事情还很多，譬如走路，过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步。残余的敌人尚待我们扫灭。严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。这就是困难。”〔注八〕只就我们党内生活来说，革命的伟大胜利对于我们是，一方面表明我们的党的事业有了伟大的进展，另一方面又表明我们的党内也将有新的问题发生。这就是党的七届二中全会决议所指出的：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”这些都正是说明，随着新过程的出现，又有各种新的矛盾和新的问题摆在我们面前需要我们解决。
    很明显的，认清楚矛盾的解决并不是矛盾的绝对消灭，承认现实世界的发展过程就是新旧矛盾的无限嬗替，这对于无产阶级的革命实践是有重大意义的。
    人们如果不能看出旧矛盾的解决就是新矛盾的出现，人们就会在新过程的发展中堕入保守和反动的立场，而为新起的矛盾所压碎。资产阶级就是如此的，它能够承认在资本主义和封建主义之间的矛盾，但是当这个矛盾以资产阶级的胜利而解决之后，它就以为在社会发展中再没有什么新的矛盾了。无产阶级则与此相反，它把资产阶级民主革命的胜利看做只是达到社会主义革命的过渡。这就是为什么我们批评那种革命胜利，万事大吉的看法是属于资产阶级观点的原故。
    有一句庸俗的谚语说：“多一事不如少一事”。其理由是，“多一事”虽然是好的，但同时又添了新的麻烦。这话是用保守的、反动的观点来对待事实的。按照这种看法，那么革命的胜利虽然是好事，但又出现了新的矛盾，新的“麻烦”，所以宁可不要胜利为好。
    革命的无产阶级不害怕任何新的“麻烦”，不害怕任何新的问题、新的矛盾，而且相反地，一定要善于运用马克思列宁主义，在旧矛盾解决的时候就已敏锐地看到在新过程中新发生的问题和困难，看到在前进中的困难，并随时准备克服困难。马克思主义使人永远坚定地向前看，永远准备着在解决了前一个矛盾后又紧跟着去在新的过程的发展中解决下一个矛盾。在这里，正是最充分地表现着无产阶级的彻底的革命性。

    毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中特别着重地论述了矛盾特殊性的问题。这就因为，研究当前具体事物的矛盾的特殊性，对于指导革命的实践是有重大意义的。
    教条主义者不懂得矛盾的普遍性和矛盾的特殊性的相互联结。他们拒绝研究矛盾的特殊性，因而只能对于形形色色的具体事物一律作出抽象的似是而非的解释，这种解释是禁不起实践的考验的。毛泽东同志在“矛盾论”中说，“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”毛泽东同志接着又说：
    “用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾，这是马克思列宁主义者必须严格地遵守的一个原则。教条主义者不遵守这个原则，他们不了解诸种革命情况的区别，因而也不了解应当用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾，而只是千篇一律地使用一种自以为不可改变的公式到处硬套，这就只能使革命遭受挫折，或者将本来做得好的事情弄得很坏。”
    另一方面，经验主义者同样的没有看到事物内外矛盾的各种联系，只是片面地孤立地抓着矛盾的某些枝节，所以经验主义者对事物就不能有全面的认识。毛泽东同志说：“只看见局部，不看见全体，只看见树木，不看见森林。这样，是不能找出解决矛盾的方法的，是不能完成革命任务的，是不能做好所任工作的，是不能正确地发展党内的思想斗争的。”
    在思想改造运动中，我们可以体会到这种情形。错误的思想倾向有各种具体的表现，为了深刻地认识错误思想的本质，找到克服它们的办法，必须透过表面上错综复杂的现象进行正确的概括，指明它的阶级的根源。阶级分析是最深刻的分析，那就因为，达到了阶级分析就是揭发了社会历史现象的本质的矛盾。
    但是当我们实际进行思想斗争时，又决不能以仅仅一般地指明阶级性为满足。在批评和自我批评中，人们不满意于用“小资产阶级思想”，“资产阶级的剥削观念”等等概念的说明来代替具体的分析，那并不因为这种一般的概念是不适用的，而是因为如果不用具体的分析来充实这种一般的概念，就不能解决问题。例如，小资产阶级思想，在这一个人身
    上表现为无政府主义倾向的革命狂热，在另一个人身上则主要表现为自私自利的观念，在第三个人身上又可以表现为狭隘的保守思想。
    教条主义拒绝进行具体事物的具体分析，因而使自己在实践中陷于无能。经验主义者只看到事物的某些个别现象，但缺乏对事物的本质的理解，所以也不能真正科学地分析研究具体事物，也不能不在实践中碰壁。
    毛泽东同志在研究主要矛盾和主要的矛盾方面时，进一步阐明了认识矛盾的特殊性对于革命实践的意义。
    根据毛泽东同志的论证，主要的矛盾和主要的矛盾方面，都会因具体的时间、地点和条件而变化。即使像生产力决定生产关系，实践决定理论，经济基础决定上层建筑这种唯物论的基本原理，也不排斥在一定条件下，生产关系、理论、上层建筑反过来成为主要的决定的东西。
    在学习“矛盾论”时，有人对外因和内因的关系问题发生误解。他们以为，既然外因通过内因而起作用，内因是变化的根据，那么在任何情况下，外因都不能对于事物的变化起决定的作用。这种绝对的看法并不是对根据与条件的关系，内因与外因的关系的辩证的认识。根据对于事物的发展是经常地起主要作用的，但是在根据业已具备，只是由于缺乏某种条件而不能实现某种变化时，内在的或外在的
    一定的条件的出现就成为促成这种变化的决定作用。这正是现实生活中的辩证法。
    人们是否从具体的时间、地点、条件出发，来分析矛盾，研究矛盾，就决定了人们是把马克思主义当做教条主义的公式呢还是把它当做革命实践的武器。
    列宁曾经指出：“我们的——恩格斯关于他自己和他那位著名的友人说道——学说并不是教条，而是行动底指南。在这个典型定义中鲜明而有力地着重指出了马克思主义往往被人忽视的一方面。忽视这一方面，就会把马克思主义变成为一种片面，畸形和毫无生气的东西，就会剜去马克思主义底生动灵魂，就会破坏它的根本理论基础的辩证法即关于包罗万象而充满矛盾的历史发展的学说，就会打破它与那些随历史每一次新转变而发生变更的一定实践时代任务之间的联系。”〔注九〕
    斯大林指出：“马克思主义在自己的发展中不能不以新的经验，新的知识而丰富起来，——因而它的个别公式和结论不能不随着时间而改变，不能不被适应于新的历史任务的新的公式和结论所代替。马克思主义不承认绝对适应于一切时代和时期的不变的结论和公式。马克思主义是一切教条主义的敌人。”〔注十〕
    毛泽东同志的光辉哲学著作“矛盾论”正是把马克思列宁主义的辩证法理论当作无产阶级的革命武器而加以阐发的。
    在“实践论”中，毛泽东同志教导说：“马克思主义的哲学辩证唯物论有两个最显著的特点：一个是它的阶级性，公然申明辩证唯物论是为无产阶级服务的；再一个是它的实践性，强调理论对于实践的依赖关系，理论的基础是实践，又转过来为实践服务。”我们在学习“矛盾论”时，也必须紧紧地把握这两个特点。马克思主义的辩证法是无产阶级的革命的批判的学说；不这样看，就不能懂得“矛盾论”。
