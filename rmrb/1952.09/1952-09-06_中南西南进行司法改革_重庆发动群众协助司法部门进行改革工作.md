    Judicial Reform in Central South and Southwest
    Chongqing Mobilizes the Masses to Assist Judicial Departments in Reform Work
    [By Our Own Correspondent] The Central South and Southwest regions are beginning to carry out judicial reform.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Central South Bureau convened a political and legal work conference from August 15th to 22nd, focusing on discussions regarding judicial reform work. The conference put forward opinions on several important tasks that various political and legal departments should carry out in the second half of this year, particularly judicial reform work, and prepared to recommend these to the Central South Military and Administrative Committee for adoption and implementation. After the heads of various political and legal units reported on their work and proposed suggestions for improvement, Lei Jingtian, President of the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court, and Xu Fengxiao, Deputy Minister of the Central South Justice Department, made self-criticism reports. Subsequently, responsible cadres of political and legal work from various provinces and cities criticized the judicial work of the Central South region, and combined this with self-criticism, specifically exposing the illegal and undisciplined behavior of old judicial personnel and the harmfulness of old legal concepts, achieving a consensus among the attendees. Following this, the conference discussed the "Draft Plan for Judicial Reform in the Central South Region," proposed by Comrade Zhang Zhisan on behalf of the Party Group of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee, to be submitted to the Political and Legal Committee and the Military and Administrative Committee. After the discussion, Comrade Li Xuefeng, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Central South Bureau, made a summary. He emphasized that judicial reform work must implement the policy of combining ideological transformation with organizational rectification. It is particularly important to launch a broad mass movement focused on eliminating old legal concepts and old legal practices, in order to establish the Marxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought's view of the state and the law. Those responsible cadres and bad elements among the old judicial personnel who have degenerated and deteriorated, have bad work styles, or persist in their old legal views without change must be dealt with seriously and promptly. Comrade Deng Zihui, Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Central South Bureau, spoke at the meeting. He said: Legal concepts, judicial procedures, judges, interrogation and investigation, and sentencing all have class character. The old personnel emphasize judicial independence, which is a reactionary class theory. He clearly pointed out that the old laws served the reactionary ruling class. The people's laws, on the other hand, are the codification of the fruits of victory by the victorious class, fixing them in place. Our Common Program, as well as the Land Reform Law, the Marriage Law, and so on, are all victorious achievements gained through the people's struggle. Legal concepts are the political understanding of the law. The old personnel's so-called "law does not interfere with politics" and "supra-class" theories are completely old legal concepts, the deceptive tricks of the former reactionary ruling class's henchmen. Speaking of judicial procedures, he said: The complex and cumbersome procedures devised by the reactionary rulers to facilitate their rule over the people and maintain their class interests, used to harass and bully the working people, must be abolished immediately. We should absorb the experience of the people's courts in following the mass line and implement judicial procedures that are convenient for the broad masses of the people. When elaborating on the issue of "judges," Comrade Deng Zihui said: People's judges (including bailiffs) are the direct executors of the law of the people's democratic dictatorship and must have the firmest class stand and the strongest class feelings. Anyone with a reactionary stand and reactionary views is not qualified to be a people's judge. Regarding interrogation and investigation, he pointed out: Interrogation and investigation also have class character. The old law simply emphasized technique, and therefore often turned falsehood into truth and truth into falsehood. The interrogation and investigation work of the people's judiciary mainly relies on following the mass line and on real evidence, so as to be realistic and not make mistakes in any case. He pointed out that sentencing has two functions: one is negative, that is, punishing criminals with penalties; the other is positive, using sentencing to educate the masses. Therefore, the higher courts should combine with the movement to select and judge major cases, provide typical demonstrations, and expand publicity to educate the masses and reduce crime. For general internal problems among the people, the focus should be on mediation, and the situation must not be expanded. Comrade Deng Zihui emphasized at the end that the people's law has two functions: exercising dictatorship over the enemy and protecting the interests of the working people. Its class character is most obvious. Anyone who does not follow the above principles and persists in not changing must be removed from the people's judicial departments.
    In order to carry out the judicial reform movement, the Political and Legal Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee has begun to organize and compile the existing materials from the people's courts at all levels in the Central South region as preparation for judicial reform, and has dispatched cadres to conduct key inspections of the courts in several provinces and cities. The Judicial Reform Office has now been established under the Political and Legal Committee of the Central South Military and Administrative Committee to lead the unfolding of judicial reform work throughout the region. In order to widely absorb the opinions of the masses in the judicial reform movement, the Central South Judicial Reform Office has set up a mass reception room in Wuhan and also set up a special mailbox specifically to receive letters from the people of the region regarding opinions on judicial reform. The Guangdong Provincial People's Court has established a judicial reform work investigation and research group, which has begun to sort out the problems exposed by the people's courts at all levels during the "Three-Anti" movement, and has sent cadres to key counties to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation of the people's courts; it has printed and distributed relevant judicial reform materials to guide cadres' study. The province plans to first launch the judicial reform movement in the Provincial People's Court in mid-September, gain experience, and then gradually extend it to the special district branch courts, city people's courts, and even county people's courts.
    All parts of the Southwest region are preparing to carry out judicial reform work. The Chongqing Municipal People's Government has established a judicial reform office to lead the city in launching the judicial reform movement. Currently, judicial cadres throughout Chongqing are studying relevant documents, combining this with work inspections, and conducting self-criticism; at the same time, various forms of mass meetings are being held to widely publicize and mobilize the people to boldly expose and actively assist the judicial departments in carrying out reform work. In the final stage of the movement, in accordance with the masses' reports and opinions, a small number of lawbreakers with serious crimes and great public resentment will be dealt with separately, and organizational rectification will be carried out to establish various systems.
    At the mobilization meeting of the Chongqing Municipal People's Court, Song Xuewu, President of the court, appropriately criticized the ideological concerns of some old judicial personnel and the erroneous understanding of some new and old cadres who believed that they did not have old legal concepts. He pointed out that judicial reform is a major ideological transformation movement to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, closely related to national construction. All judicial personnel, without exception, should earnestly and seriously carry out transformation in the movement based on their existing problems and shortcomings, so as to eliminate old judicial concepts and old judicial styles, and gradually strengthen and build the people's judicial system. The people of all walks of life in Chongqing warmly support the judicial reform movement. Mass organizations throughout the city and political and legal departments of relevant universities have sent personnel to assist in carrying out judicial reform work.

    中南西南进行司法改革
    重庆发动群众协助司法部门进行改革工作
    【本报讯】中南区和西南区开始进行司法改革。
    中共中央中南局于八月十五日至二十二日召开政法工作会议，着重讨论了司法改革工作，提出了关于各政法部门在今年下半年度应进行的几件重要工作、特别是司法改革工作的意见，准备建议中南军政委员会采纳执行。会议由政法各单位负责人汇报工作提出改进工作意见后，由最高人民法院中南分院院长雷经天及中南司法部副部长徐风笑作自我检讨报告，然后由各省市的政法工作负责干部对中南司法工作提出批评，并结合自我检讨，具体地揭露了旧司法人员违法乱纪的行为及旧法观点的危害性，取得了到会人员认识上的一致。接着，会议讨论了张执一同志代表中南军政委员会政法委员会党组所作的拟向政法委员会及军政委员会建议的关于中南区司法工作改革方案（草案）。讨论结束后，由中共中央中南局副书记李雪峰同志作总结。他强调指出：司法改革工作，必须贯彻思想改造与组织整顿相结合的方针，特别重要的是要掀起一个广泛的以肃清旧法观点和旧法作风为主的群众运动，以确立马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想的国家观和法律观。对于那些已经堕落蜕化、作风恶劣或坚持旧法观点不改的负责干部和旧司法人员中的坏分子必须严肃地及时地加以处理。中共中央中南局第二书记邓子恢同志在会上讲话。他说：法律观点、司法程序、法官、审讯侦查、科刑都是有阶级性的；旧人员强调司法独立，这是反动阶级的理论。他明确指出：旧的法律是为反动统治阶级服务的。而人民的法律则是胜利的阶级把胜利的果实条文化，把它固定下来。我们的共同纲领以及土地改革法、婚姻法等等都是人民斗争得来的胜利成果。法律观点便是法律的政治认识。旧人员的所谓法律不过问政治论、超阶级论，这些都是彻头彻尾的旧法观点，是过去反动统治阶级御用人员骗人的鬼话。讲到司法程序，他说：反动统治者为了便利统治人民，维护其阶级利益而订出来的一套复杂的，用以刁难和欺负劳动人民的繁琐程序，必须立即废除；应吸收人民法庭走群众路线的经验，实行便利于广大人民的司法程序。邓子恢同志在阐述“法官”的问题时说：人民法官（包括法警在内）是人民民主专政国家的法律直接执行者，必须有最坚定的阶级立场，最强烈的阶级感情，任何有反动立场和反动观点的人，都没有资格担任人民的法官。关于审讯侦查，他指出：审讯侦查也是有阶级性的，旧法单纯强调技术，因此往往弄假成真，弄真成假；人民司法的审讯侦查工作，主要靠走群众路线，靠真实的证据，这样才能实事求是，不会办错一个案件。他指出科刑有两种作用：一是消极的，即惩处犯罪者以刑罚，另一个是积极的以判刑来教育群众，因此，高级法院应结合运动，选判主要案件，典型示范，并扩大宣传，以教育群众减少犯罪；一般人民内部的问题，要着重调解，决不能扩大事态。邓子恢同志最后强调地指出人民法律的两种作用，是对敌人专政，和保护劳动人民的利益。它的阶级性最为明显，一切不遵循上述原则而又坚持不改的人，必须要把他从人民的司法部门中清除出去。
    中南军政委员会政法委员会为开展司法改革运动，已经着手整理与汇集中南区各级人民法院的现有材料，作为司法改革的准备，并抽调干部重点视察了几个省、市法院。现在中南军政委员会政治法律委员会已成立司法改革办公室，负责领导全区展开司法改革工作。中南司法改革办公室为了在司法改革运动中广泛吸收群众意见，除在武汉市设立群众接待室，还特设专用信箱，专门接受该区人民群众有关司法改革意见的信件。广东省人民法院已成立司法改革工作调查研究小组，开始整理各级人民法院在“三反”运动中暴露出来的问题，并派出干部赴重点县深入了解人民法院情况；印发有关司法改革资料，指导干部学习。该省准备在九月中旬先在省人民法院展开司法改革运动，吸取经验后再逐步推广到专区分院、市人民法院以至县人民法院。
    西南全区各地正在准备进行司法改革工作。重庆市人民政府已成立司法改革办公室，领导全市展开了司法改革运动。目前，重庆全市司法干部正在学习有关文件，结合检查工作，进行自我批判；同时召开各种形式的群众会议，广泛展开宣传，发动人民群众大胆揭发，积极协助司法部门进行改革工作。运动最后阶段，将根据群众的检举和意见，对少数有严重罪行、民愤较大的违法分子，分别加以处理，并进行组织整顿，建立各项制度。
    重庆市人民法院院长宋学武在该院的动员大会上，对某些旧司法人员存在的思想顾虑和某些新、老干部认为他们没有旧法观点的错误认识，分别作了适当的批判。他指出：司法改革是巩固人民民主专政的一个重大的思想改造运动，密切关系国家建设，全体司法人员一无例外，都应当根据自己存在的问题和缺点，认真、严肃地在运动中积极进行改造，达到肃清旧司法观点与旧司法作风，把人民的司法制度，逐步加强和建设起来。重庆市各界人民热烈拥护司法改革运动。全市各群众团体、各有关大学的政治法律系，都派出人员协助进行司法改革工作。
