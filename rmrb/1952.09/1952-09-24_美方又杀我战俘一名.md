    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd. The U.S. side announced that on the 21st, another of our captured personnel "hanged himself" on Jeju Island. The recent series of similar incidents is clearly related to the U.S. side's recent illegal act of transferring large numbers of prisoners of war to the Syngman Rhee gang. Although the U.S. side claims to have "started an investigation" every time an incident occurs, all "investigations" have never been followed up. The U.S. side's evasive attitude shows that they are afraid that even fabricated "investigation" results will reveal the truth about their abuse and murder of prisoners of war who refuse to be forcibly detained.

    美方又杀我战俘一名
    【新华社开城二十三日电】美方宣布二十一日在济州岛上又有一名我方被俘人员“上吊自尽”。最近发生的一连串同样事件，显然与美方最近将大批战俘移交给李承晚匪帮的非法行为有关。虽然美方在每一次事件发生的时候，都声称“已经开始进行调查”，但所有“调查”却从来没有下文。美方这种讳莫如深的态度，说明他们害怕即使是捏造出来的“调查”结果，都会泄露出他们虐杀拒绝被强迫扣留的战俘的真相。
