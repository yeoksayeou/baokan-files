    Beijing Paper Mill Workers Increase Production to Welcome the Peace Conference

    Editor: The Peace Conference for the Asian and Pacific Regions is about to be held in our nation's capital. We, the workers of New China, warmly congratulate the success of this conference.

    The war-mongers, headed by American imperialism, disregard the will of hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, destroy various international conventions, and attempt to revive the Nazi forces in West Germany and Japanese militarism. This frantic behavior of American imperialism seriously threatens the peaceful lives of people of all countries.

    Our Beijing Paper Mill has made significant achievements in all aspects during more than three years of peaceful construction. In terms of production, the current daily output of the entire factory has increased by 826.25% compared to the time of liberation. Recently, under the guidance of the advanced theories of Soviet expert Wie Liejin, our factory workers successfully experimented with the "straw semi-pulp manufacturing method," opening up a new path for the paper industry of New China. With the increase in production, the welfare of our workers has also greatly improved. The days of eating "bean dregs noodles" before liberation are, needless to say, gone; the scene of scrambling to buy cornmeal just after liberation is also a thing of the past. The cooperative in our factory now sells mostly rice and white flour. This year, 10% of the workers in the factory have ridden new bicycles. We have our own clinic, nursery, library, and amateur cultural school. There are now only two illiterate people in the entire factory. We have all suffered from the disasters of war, and we deeply know the value of our current peaceful and happy life. Therefore, we will never allow any war instigators to touch it. Seeing the American imperialists creating such a tense international situation, we are filled with righteous indignation and have decided to respond to the war-mongers with practical actions of "increasing production and practicing strict economy." In order to celebrate the convening of this peace conference, the workers of our entire factory have decided to increase the current daily output by another 20% by the end of this year. In this health campaign, we have eliminated a total of 130,000 mosquitoes and 650,000 flies throughout the factory. This is a powerful counterattack against the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. We, the workers of New China, have sufficient determination and strength to undertake the cause of defending peace.

    北京造纸厂全体工人提高生产迎接和平会议
    编辑同志：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在我国的首都召开。我们新中国的工人，热烈地祝贺这个会议的成功。
    以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们，不顾世界亿万爱好和平的人民的意志，破坏各项国际公约，力图复活西德的纳粹势力和日本军国主义。美帝国主义这种疯狂的行为，严重地威胁着各国人民的和平生活。
    我们北京造纸厂在三年多的和平建设中，各方面都有了显著的成绩。从生产上来说，现在全厂的日产量较刚解放时提高百分之八百二十六点二五。最近我厂工人在苏联专家威烈基金的先进理论的指导下，试验成功了“稻草制造半料浆法”，为新中国的造纸工业开辟了新的道路。随着生产的提高，我们工人的生活福利也有了很大的改善。解放以前吃“豆渣面”的日子不消说是不会有了；刚解放时抢着购棒子面的光景也一去不复返了。我们厂里的合作社现在卖的尽是大米和白面。今年，全厂有百分之十的工人骑上了崭新的自行车。我们有了自己的医务室、托儿所、图书馆和业余文化学校。全厂现在只有二个不认识字的文盲。我们都是受过战争的灾害的，我们深知现在的和平幸福生活的可贵。因此，我们决不容许任何战争挑拨者来触动它。我们看到美帝国主义者这样在制造紧张的国际局势，我们就义愤填胸地决定以“增加生产，厉行节约”的实际行动来回答战争贩子们。为了庆祝这次和平会议的召开，我们全厂工人决定到今年年底较目前的日产量再提高百分之二十。在这次卫生运动中，我们全厂共扑灭十三万个蚊子和六十五万个苍蝇。这就给美帝国主义的细菌战一个有力的回击。我们新中国的工人有足够的决心和力量把保卫和平的事业担当起来。    北京造纸厂全体工人
