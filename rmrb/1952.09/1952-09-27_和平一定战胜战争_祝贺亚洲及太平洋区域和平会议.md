    Peace Will Surely Triumph Over War
    ——Congratulations to the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Park Chung-ai, Vice-Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace, Stalin International Peace Prize Winner
    The preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, held in Beijing in June this year, stated in its declaration: "Today, the good wishes of 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions are being threatened by the specter of war and war preparations."
    The threat of war exists not only in Asia. Europe, too, faces a similar threat due to the destruction of international agreements on the demilitarization and democratization of Germany and Austria by the U.S. imperialists.
    Under these circumstances, in order to eliminate the threat of war and shatter the evil conspiracies of the aggressors, there must be a tremendous force to restrain all the reckless actions of the imperialist war instigators. This force is the power of the world peace camp, united by hundreds of millions of kind and honest people around the globe. This force, which is becoming stronger and more consolidated every day, is blocking the path of the war instigators.
    The forces of the democratic, peace, and socialist camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, are united and stronger than ever today. To eliminate the threat of a third world war, hundreds of millions of conscientious and sincere people around the world, regardless of political views, beliefs, or professions, regardless of gender or age, are fighting together in one big family. All those who uphold a life of peace, common happiness, and progressive culture and human morality have stood under the banner of peace. The peace movement has become an invincible force, developing in every country and on every continent around the world.
    Especially on the eve of the Peace Conference held in Beijing, the struggle of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions for peace has seen significant development.
    The convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will greatly promote the preparatory work for the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna on December 5th this year, and will become a major event in the lives of people in various countries.
    The Peace Conference held in Beijing will strengthen the solidarity of the peace forces of the people of the Asian continent and the Pacific region, and contribute to the peaceful resolution of the Far East issue.
    We, the Korean people, and the people of Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines, and other countries, who are waging bloody struggles against the aggressors, are all directly or indirectly suffering from the disasters of U.S. imperialist aggression. Therefore, the people of all Asian countries are eagerly hoping that this Peace Conference held in Beijing will adopt effective counter-measures, immediately prohibit the U.S. imperialists from using napalm bombs, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons, so as to reach an agreement in the Kaesong armistice negotiations on a fair and reasonable basis, and stop the bloody wars being waged by the aggressors in Vietnam, Malaya, the Philippines and other places, and withdraw foreign troops stationed in countries in the Asian and Pacific regions.
    The revival of Japanese militarism and its military potential under the protection of the U.S. imperialists poses a major threat to the people of Asian countries. The tragedy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima by Truman's order has not yet faded from the memory of the Japanese people and progressive humanity. The pain of being subjected to the oppression of Japanese militarism for half a century is still fresh in the memory of every Korean person. The wounds suffered by the Chinese people due to the long-term aggression of Japanese imperialism have not yet fully healed, but today U.S. imperialism has rearmed Japan, reactivated Japanese germ warfare criminals, and spread plague, cholera, typhoid, anthrax and other bacteria against China and Korea.
    Progressive humanity must not tolerate the crimes of war organizers who specialize in destruction and massacre.
    The unilateral peace treaty with Japan and the U.S.-Japan military treaty, which the U.S. government forcibly signed in violation of the wishes and demands of the peace-loving people of the Far East (including the Japanese people), seriously threaten the peace and security of the Asian people.
    The U.S. imperialist occupiers, who have effectively become the supreme emperors of Japan, have turned the entire Japanese territory into their military base, constantly carrying out barbaric bombings of peaceful towns and villages in Korea, and engaging in provocative incursions into Chinese airspace. The U.S. military authorities have dispatched Japanese troops from the so-called "Police Reserve Force" to the Korean battlefield.
    In its criminal war against the Korean people, the U.S. aggressors, in order to satisfy their military needs, have not only utilized the Japanese army, but also utilized all of Japan's industries and transportation facilities, and plundered the grain earned by Japanese farmers with their blood and sweat to supply its invading army. The U.S. imperialist occupiers have violently trampled on the international agreements on the demilitarization and democratization of Japan, and defiled and strangled Japanese national culture.
    This policy of U.S. imperialism towards Japan shows that they are frantically opposing the Asian people, strangling the freedom and independence of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, turning Japan into its base of aggression, and turning the Japanese people into its cheap cannon fodder.
    The Peace Conference held in Beijing must not ignore the pain and suffering of the current Japanese people, or the dangers faced by the Asian people. The Japanese people do not want war, they want peace. The Japanese people do not want to wage war against China and Korea, and hope that the people of China and Korea and all peace-loving people around the world can have peace and security. The Japanese people do not want to be slaves of U.S. imperialism, they want to be free masters of Japan. The Japanese people do not want to see the impudent behavior of the U.S. invading army, which is commonplace on the streets and in the restaurants of Tokyo and other Japanese cities. The Japanese people demand the development of their own national culture and science, and they do not want to participate in barbaric bacteriological warfare. They have not forgotten the tragedy of Hiroshima. They hate and oppose the Japanese "scientists" who are helping those conscienceless American "scientists" who are conducting bacteriological warfare against the people of China and Korea.
    The Korean people have suffered the pain of Japanese militarist rule for the past half century. Therefore, the U.S. support of the activities of Japanese militarism makes the Korean people feel particularly uneasy, and it also makes all peace-loving people in Asia uneasy.
    That is why we are confident that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will resolutely oppose the revival of Japanese militarism and the unilaterally signed peace treaty with Japan that the United States illegally signed. We are confident that the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing will support the declaration of the preparatory meeting of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing in June this year, and take practical and effective measures to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism.
    When the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference was held in Beijing, the Peace Defence Committees of various countries received a letter from Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Council. Joliot-Curie, an outstanding peace fighter and humanitarian, called on the Peace Defence Committees of various countries to widely and deeply publicize the resolutions of the World Peace Council in preparation for the World People's Peace Congress. The resolution pointed out that a genuine peace treaty with Japan signed by the countries concerned and a peaceful resolution of the German issue would prevent the revival of forces that bring death and terror to all continents. An immediate cessation of military action in Korea on a reasonable basis would relieve the suffering of the Korean people and eliminate the danger of the war spreading to all of Asia.
    The reduction of all kinds of armaments and the strict control of atomic, chemical, and bacteriological weapons would allow the huge sums of money that are used to slaughter humanity and become a heavy burden on every family to be used for measures to maintain and improve human life.
    This clear call from the Chairman of the World Peace Council is a manifestation of human reason, will, conscience, and desire. Joliot-Curie's letter, which has become the preparatory program for the Vienna World People's Peace Congress, will also become an important guiding document in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference.
    The Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace and the Peace Promotion Committees in various regions have taken the spirit of Joliot-Curie's letter as their own work guide.
    The Korean delegates representing the thirty million Korean people who are participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing will reflect the unanimous wishes of all patriotic men and women in our country at the conference.
    There is only one unanimous wish of us Korean people: that is, to make the U.S. imperialists immediately stop their armed interference in Korea, to make our country unified into an independent and democratic country, and to make the American war criminals who used napalm bombs, chemical weapons, and bacteriological weapons and their accomplices be severely judged by the peace-loving people, so as to guarantee the peace and security of the people of Asia and the world. This is the only hope and goal of every Korean patriot. The Korean people have been bravely fighting for more than two years with weapons in hand against the U.S. armed interventionists and the Lee Seung-man traitorous bandits in order to achieve this goal. The Korean people's armed struggle against the aggressors is an integral part of the just struggle of all peace-loving people around the world for peace and security.
    We are not isolated in our just struggle. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, is helping us with their blood. The great Soviet people, who are marching towards communism under the leadership of the wise teacher of mankind and the liberator of the Korean people – the great Marshal Stalin, are continuing to give our Korean people endless support. On our side, the Korean people have the great assistance and support in spirit and material from the people of our great neighbor – the People's Republic of China – led by Chairman Mao Zedong. The sympathy and respect of progressive humanity around the world are directed towards the Korean people, and the active assistance and support of the people of the world to the Korean people in both spirit and material are encouraging our struggle and becoming a source of endless strength for our struggle for the honor, freedom and independence of our motherland.
    The Korean issue will inevitably become the central issue for extensive discussion by the peace fighters representing 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific regions. The people of the world will never allow the U.S. war peddlers to spread the various bestial atrocities they have committed in Korea to other countries. The people of the world will never allow the U.S. napalm bombs that have fallen on the heads of our Korean women, the elderly, and children to also fall on the heads of women, the elderly, and children in other countries. The people of the world cannot allow the U.S. imperialists to threaten the people of other countries with the plague, cholera, typhoid, anthrax, and other germs that they have spread in Korea and Northeast China. For this reason, the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will represent the conscience and wishes of the 1.6 billion people in this region and the human race to demand to the world: "Stop the bloody war in Korea provoked by the U.S. armed aggressors," "Restore peace in Korea," "U.S. troops get out of Korea."
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference held in Beijing will also spread this just call to the world for the people of Vietnam, Malaya, and the Philippines who have made great contributions to the great cause of fighting for freedom, independence, and defending world peace and the security of the people.
    We, the Korean people, under the leadership of the Korean Workers’ Party and its leader General Kim Il-sung, are moving vigorously towards democracy and peace together with the people of the democratic and peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union.
    "If the peoples of all countries take up the cause of safeguarding peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be preserved and consolidated." Marshal Stalin's words have pointed out the bright future for the people of the world and the road for peace to triumph over war. (Xinhua News Agency)

    和平一定战胜战争
    ——祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会副委员长  “加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人  朴正爱
    今年六月间在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议在它的宣言中说：“在今天，我们亚洲及太平洋区域各国十六亿人民的善良愿望，却正遭受着战争和备战的魔影的威胁。”
    战争的威胁不仅存在于亚洲。就是欧洲也由于美帝国主义者破坏了关于德国和奥地利的非军国主义化和民主化的国际协定而同样存在着战争的威胁。
    在这种形势下，为了消除战争的威胁和粉碎侵略者的罪恶阴谋，就必须具有制裁帝国主义战争挑拨者一切蠢动的巨大力量，这就是地球上千百万善良、朴实的人民团结起来的世界和平阵营的力量。这个一天天地巩固和加强着的力量，正在阻挡着战争挑拨者的进路。
    以伟大的苏联为首的民主、和平、社会主义阵营的力量，今天已空前地团结、壮大起来了。为了消除第三次世界大战的威胁，全世界千百万有良知的纯朴的人们，不分政治见解、信仰和职业，不分男女老幼，一致团结在一个大家庭里进行斗争。所有维护和平的生活、共同的幸福以及进步的文化和人类道德的人们，都已经站到和平的旗帜下面来了。和平运动已成为不可战胜的力量，在全世界每一个国家内和每一个大陆上开展着。
    特别是在北京召开的和平会议的前夕，亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民争取和平的斗争更有了重大的发展。
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的召开，将大大地推动今年十二月五日在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会的筹备工作，成为各国人民生活上的一个重大事件。
    在北京召开的和平会议将加强亚洲大陆及太平洋区域各国人民和平力量的团结，对和平解决远东问题有所贡献。
    为反对侵略者而进行流血斗争的我们朝鲜人民和越南、马来亚、菲律宾等国人民，都直接间接地共同遭受着美帝国主义侵略的灾祸。因此，亚洲各国人民都热望这次在北京召开的和平会议采取有效的斗争对策，立即禁止美帝国主义者使用凝固汽油弹、化学武器及细菌武器，以便在公平合理的基础上使开城停战谈判达成协议，并制止侵略者在越南、马来亚、菲律宾等地所进行的流血战争，撤退驻在亚洲及太平洋区域国家内的外国军队。
    在美帝国主义者的庇护之下复活着的日本军国主义和它的军事潜力，对亚洲各国人民是一个重大的威胁。由于杜鲁门的命令而在广岛投下原子弹的惨剧，尚未从日本人民和进步人类的记忆中消失。半世纪来身受日本军国主义压迫的惨痛，在每一个朝鲜人民的心中记忆犹新。由于日本帝国主义长期的侵略，中国人民所受到的创伤尚未完全恢复，但是美帝国主义今天却已重新武装日本，起用日本细菌战犯，对朝中两国散布鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、炭疽等细菌。
    进步人类绝不能容忍专事破坏与屠杀的战争组织者的罪行。
    美国政府违反了远东爱好和平人民（包括日本人民在内）的愿望和要求而强行签订的片面对日和约和美日军事条约，严重地威胁了亚洲人民的和平与安全。
    实际上成为日本太上皇的美帝国主义强占者把整个日本领土变成其军事基地，对朝鲜的和平城乡不断地进行野蛮的轰炸，对中国领空也在进行挑衅性的侵犯。美军当局已将所谓“警察后备队”的日军派到朝鲜战场。
    美国侵略者在对朝鲜人民的罪恶的战争中，为了满足其军事上的需要，不但起用日本军队，而且利用了日本的全部产业和运输机构，并抢夺日本农民以血汗换来的粮食供给它的侵略军队。美帝国主义强占者横暴地蹂躏了关于日本非军国主义化和民主化的国际协定，污辱和绞杀了日本的民族文化。
    美帝国主义者对日本的这种政策，表明它们正在疯狂地反对亚洲人民，绞杀亚洲及太平洋地区人民的自由和独立，变日本为其侵略基地，变日本人民为其廉价的炮灰。
    在北京召开的和平会议对于目前日本人民的痛苦和灾难，对于亚洲人民面临的危险绝不能置之不理。日本人民不要战争，要求和平。日本人民不愿对朝中两国进行战争，愿望朝中两国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民得到和平与安全。日本人民不愿做美帝国主义的奴隶，要做日本的自由的主人。日本人民不愿意看见在东京及日本其他城市的街道上和餐厅中所司空见惯的美国侵略军的无赖行为。日本人民要求发展自己民族的文化和科学，他们不愿意参加野蛮的细菌战。他们没有忘记广岛的悲剧。他们憎恨和反对日本的“科学家”帮助那些丧尽天良对朝中两国人民进行细菌战的美国“科学家”。
    朝鲜人民在最近的半个世纪中，饱尝了日本军国主义统治的痛苦，所以美国扶植日本军国主义的活动使朝鲜人民特别感到不安，同时也使亚洲全体爱好和平的人民感到不安。
    正因为如此，我们确信：亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议必将坚决反对日本军国主义的复活和美国非法签订的片面对日和约。我们确信：在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议必将支持今年六月在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的宣言，采取实际有效的措施，反对日本军国主义的复活。
    当亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在北京召开的时候，各国保卫和平委员会接到了世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里的一封信。卓越的和平战士与人道主义者约里奥—居里，为筹备举行世界人民和平大会，号召各国保卫和平委员会广泛而深入地宣传世界和平理事会的决议。这个决议指出：由有关各国签订的、真正的对日和约和关于德国问题的和平解决，将能防止给所有大陆带来死亡和恐怖的武力的复活。在合理的基础上立即停止在朝鲜的军事行动，将解除朝鲜人民的痛苦，并将消除战争扩大到全亚洲的危险。
    各种军备的裁减和原子、化学、细菌武器的严格管制，将使屠杀人类和成为每一个家庭的沉重负担的巨额税金，用在维持和提高人类生活的措施上面。
    世界和平理事会主席这一明彻的号召，是人类理智、意志、良心与愿望的表现。成为维也纳世界人民和平大会筹备纲领的约里奥—居里的信，在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议中也将成为重要的指导文献。
    朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会和各地的拥护和平委员会已将约里奥—居里这封信的精神作为自己的工作指针。
    代表三千万朝鲜人民参加在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的朝鲜代表们，将在会议上反映我国全体男女爱国者的一致愿望。
    我们朝鲜人民的一致愿望只有一个：就是：要使美帝国主义者立即停止对朝鲜的武装干涉，要使我国统一成为独立、民主的国家，要让使用凝固汽油弹、化学武器、细菌武器的美国战犯及其帮凶受到爱好和平人民的严正裁判，以保障亚洲及全世界人民的和平与安全。这就是朝鲜每一个爱国者唯一的希望与目的。朝鲜人民为达到这个目的手执武器对美国武装干涉者及李承晚卖国匪帮进行了两年以上的英勇战斗。朝鲜人民反对侵略者的武装斗争是全世界爱好和平人民争取和平与安全的正义斗争的一个组成部分。
    我们在正义的斗争中并不是孤立的。由伟大的中国人民的优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军，正以鲜血援助着我们。在人类的英明导师、朝鲜人民的解放恩人——伟大的斯大林大元帅领导之下向共产主义迈进的、伟大的苏联人民，正继续给予我们朝鲜人民以无穷无尽的声援和支持。在我们朝鲜人民这一边有着毛泽东主席领导的、我们伟大的邻邦——中华人民共和国人民在精神上和物质上的巨大援助和支持。全世界进步人类的同情和尊敬都向着朝鲜人民，全世界人民在精神物质两方面对朝鲜人民的积极援助和支持，正在鼓舞着我们的斗争，成为我们争取祖国荣誉、自由与独立的无穷力量的源泉。
    朝鲜问题必将成为代表亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民的和平战士们广泛讨论的中心问题。全世界人民绝不容许美国战争贩子将其在朝鲜所制造的种种野兽暴行波及到旁的国家。全世界人民绝不容许落在我们朝鲜妇女、老人与儿童头上的美国凝固汽油弹，也落到其他国家的妇女、老人与儿童们的头上。全世界人民更不能容许美帝国主义者拿它在朝鲜和中国东北地区撒布的那些鼠疫、霍乱、伤寒、炭疽等病菌来威胁其他国家的人民。正因为如此，亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将代表这个区域的十六亿人民和全世界人类的良心与愿望，向全世界要求：“停止美国武装侵略者挑起的朝鲜流血战争”，“恢复朝鲜的和平”，“美国军队滚出朝鲜”。
    在北京召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议也将为在争取自由、独立和保卫世界和平与人民安全的伟大事业中有巨大贡献的越南、马来亚、菲律宾的人民，向全世界传播这种正义的呼声。
    在朝鲜劳动党及其领袖金日成将军领导下的我们朝鲜人民，正在和以伟大的苏联为首的民主与和平阵营的人民一道，向着民主与和平有力地前进着。
    “如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”斯大林大元帅的这句话，已给全世界人民指出了光明的未来以及和平战胜战争的道路。（新华社）
