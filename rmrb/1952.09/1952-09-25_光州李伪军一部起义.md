Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: Rhee Syngman's puppet soldiers, forced to serve as cannon fodder for the American imperialist aggressors, have extremely low morale due to repeated defeats and severe maltreatment. Incidents of mutiny, desertion, and uprising occur frequently among the puppet soldiers. According to a report in the "Labor News" newspaper, despite the Rhee Syngman gang's further strengthening of surveillance activities among the puppet soldiers and creating so-called "Deserter Surrender Week" and other methods, the number of "incidents" among the puppet soldiers is still gradually increasing. During the seventh anniversary of the liberation of Korea on August 15th, a riot occurred in the conscript youth reception center of the puppet army in Gwangju. Following this, in late August, a unit of puppet soldiers in Gwangju announced an uprising and defected to the nearby People's Guerrilla forces.

The uprising puppet soldiers were from the mobile squadron of the 678th unit of the puppet army stationed at Gwangju Station. Long ago, they had established contact with the People's Guerrilla forces operating in the Gwangju area. In the days leading up to the uprising, these soldiers had been severely beaten by puppet army officers, which further fueled their anger and rebellious sentiments. At 11 p.m. on the 24th, more than a dozen puppet soldiers, fully armed, initiated the uprising by disarming the unit's sentries and storming into the officers' quarters, killing the puppet officers. Then, they fired signal flares in front of the puppet soldiers' barracks, shouting slogans: "Down with American Imperialism and the Rhee Syngman Gang" "Long Live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea." A large number of puppet soldiers poured out and joined the ranks of the uprising. The uprising soldiers, while firing their guns in demonstration, calmly advanced toward the guerrilla base. The puppet railway security forces stationed nearby, intimidated by the momentum of the uprising soldiers, not only did not dare to intercept them, but also fled in all directions.

The puppet South Jeolla Province Military and Police Headquarters was panicked by this and immediately mobilized military police and secret agents to impose an emergency curfew in Gwangju City. The next morning, more than 200 puppet military police in Gwangju City and more than 500 puppet police transferred from Damyang, Hwasun and other places, surrounded the area of ​​nearby Mudeung Mountain (transliteration) and carried out so-called "suppression." However, the enemy gained nothing in the successive days of "suppression." The only "achievement" they obtained was the brutal massacre of a group of innocent people. The "Labor News" pointed out that under the influence of South Korean patriots and the People's Guerrilla forces, the Rhee Syngman puppet soldiers continue to riot and revolt, giving the American and Rhee gangs a heavy blow.

    光州李伪军一部起义
    【新华社平壤讯】被迫充当美帝国主义侵略炮灰的李承晚伪军，由于屡遭失败和备受虐待，士气十分低沉。伪军中暴动、逃亡和起义的事件经常发生。据“劳动新闻”报报道：尽管李承晚匪帮在伪军中进一步加强了监视活动，并制造了所谓“逃兵自首周”等办法，但是，伪军士兵“出事”的次数仍在逐渐增加中。在“八·一五”朝鲜解放七周年的时候，光州市伪军的征兵青年收容所里，曾发生暴动事件。在此之后，八月下旬，光州有伪军士兵
    一部宣告起义，投奔附近的人民游击队。
    起义伪军士兵是驻扎在光州车站的伪军六七八一部队机动中队的士兵。很久以前，他们就和在光州一带活动的人民游击队取得了联系。起义的前几天，这些士兵曾遭受伪军军官的毒打，因而更加充满了愤怒和反抗的情绪。二十四日晚十一时，全副武装的十多名伪军士兵首先起义，解除了该部队哨兵的武装，冲入军官宿舍，打死了伪军官。然后，在伪军士兵宿舍前面发射信号枪，高呼口号：“打倒美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮”“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁”。大批伪军士兵拥出来，加入了起义行列。起义的士兵一面开枪示威，一面从容地向游击队基地前进。驻在附近的伪铁道警备队慑于起义士兵的声势，不但不敢阻击，而且四散逃窜。
    伪全罗南道军警指挥部为此惊慌万状，立即动员军警特务，在光州市内实行紧急戒严。第二天清晨，光州市内的伪军警二百多名和从潭阳、和顺等地调来的伪警五百多名，包围了附近的无等山（译音）一带，进行所谓“讨伐”。但是，敌人在接连几天的“讨伐”中什么也没有得到，他们得到的唯一“成绩”是残暴地屠杀了一批无辜人民。 “劳动新闻”报指出：李承晚伪军士兵在南朝鲜爱国志士和人民游击队影响之下，不断暴动、起义，给予美李匪帮以沉重的打击。
