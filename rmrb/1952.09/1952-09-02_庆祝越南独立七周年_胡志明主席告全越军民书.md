Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Vietnam News Agency dispatch: President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in celebration of Vietnam's National Day, issued a letter to all people, troops, and cadres. The full text is as follows:

Fellow compatriots, People's Army, and cadres:

Today, we celebrate the seventh anniversary of independence. Let us look back at our achievements in the past few years of resistance. Our people, who have been oppressed and exploited by the French colonialists for eighty years, united under the leadership of the Party, bravely and resolutely fought the enemy, achieved the victory of the "August Revolution," and established the independent and unified Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Our goal is to build our country and bring happiness to the people. But the French colonialists insisted on launching a war of aggression, attempting to once again plunder our territory and enslave our people. They used all kinds of extremely vicious means to kill millions of our compatriots, destroy hundreds and thousands of our villages, bomb our dikes, and destroy our crops. Faced with such brutal crimes of the French colonialists, our entire nation, united as one, resolutely resisted. While resisting, we engaged in national construction. Due to our spirit of loving the country, and due to the unparalleled strength of our people, we have overcome all difficulties and achieved considerable success.

On the military front, from the end of 1950 to the present, our army has continuously achieved victories. In the enemy's rear, the strength of guerrilla warfare has grown, and guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases have expanded. Economically, our production efficiency has steadily increased. The campaign to increase production and practice economy has been enthusiastically responded to by all our compatriots. Politically, our victory has been even greater. Domestically, all the people are more closely united, and the Vietnam National United Front is increasingly consolidated; the people, troops, and cadres have deeply penetrated the idea that "resistance will surely be victorious, but resistance must be long-term, arduous, and self-reliant." Internationally, the fraternal friendship and cooperation between us and the people of Cambodia and Laos has become closer. Our international position has improved. In addition, two victories that have had a significant impact on our resistance and construction efforts are: rectification and patriotic emulation. These two movements are being widely and deeply implemented among our cadres, troops, and the masses of the people, and have achieved good results. The ability to achieve such results is due to the correctness of the policies of the Party and the government, the bravery of the people and the troops, and the fact that the vast majority of the cadres are loyal and wholeheartedly serve the people, especially the heroic fighting spirit of our compatriots, troops, and cadres in the enemy's rear.

But we must not be arrogant and complacent, but must work harder to overcome our shortcomings and promote our strengths, in order to create even greater achievements. Our main shortcomings are that some cadres are still unable to effectively implement "diligence, frugality, integrity, and righteousness," have not yet correctly grasped the policies of the Party and the government, have not followed the mass line, and lack the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. They are still infected with the bad habits of bureaucracy, commandism, corruption, and waste. These shortcomings have been fully exposed in the work of carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy and collecting agricultural and industrial-commercial taxes.

Fellow compatriots, troops, and cadres:

The French colonialists, the American imperialist interventionists, and their running dogs, the Vietnamese traitors and puppets, are in a state of panic, difficulty, and mutual contradiction. They are destined to fail, but the closer they get to failure, the more frantic and brutal they become. Their vicious plot is the policy of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese." They are stepping up their efforts to search, plunder, conscript soldiers, and recruit laborers in the enemy-occupied areas. They are also trying every possible means to sabotage our economy.

Therefore, the closer we get to victory, the more difficulties there will be; we must be more determined to overcome all difficulties in order to win the final victory. All our people and army, the Party and the government, must do a good job in completing the following tasks:

*   Implement increased production and practice economy;
*   Promote and develop guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear;
*   Rectify the ideology and work style of cadres;
*   Consolidate the army and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the troops;
*   Prepare to rectify mass work.

While carrying out the above tasks, we must create a movement that truly realizes "diligence, frugality, integrity, and righteousness" and opposes corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. We must also effectively promote the patriotic emulation movement in all departments and localities.

Fellow compatriots, troops, and cadres:

Can we accomplish the above tasks? We certainly can! The forces of the French colonialists, the American imperialist interventionists, and their puppets are declining. On our side, after a long period of resistance, our people, troops, and cadres have been tested and have become more determined and stronger. The strength of the world peace and democracy camp is expanding. The Soviet Union, China, and other democratic countries are becoming stronger. The support of the people of democratic countries, the French people, the people of French colonies, and the people of the world for us is increasing day by day. Therefore, we will definitely be able to accomplish the above tasks, thereby making full preparations to shift to the general counter-offensive, strive for the independence and unity of the motherland, and make more contributions to the cause of defending world peace.

On this occasion of celebrating the anniversary of the independence of the motherland, on behalf of the government, I extend my heartfelt care and greetings to:

*   Compatriots in the liberated areas, the enemy-occupied areas, and overseas compatriots,
*   Heroes and models of patriotic emulation,
*   Soldiers and cadres of the People's Army, local troops, guerrillas, and militia,
*   Disabled veterans, sick and weak soldiers, and families of military martyrs,
*   Cadres and staff of government agencies and people's organizations,
*   Elders, youth, and children.

Resistance will surely be victorious!

Long live the independence and unity of Vietnam!

Ho Chi Minh

    庆祝越南独立七周年
    胡志明主席告全越军民书
    【新华社一日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席，为庆祝越南国庆，特发表告全体人民、部队和干部书。全文如下：全体同胞、人民部队和干部们：
    今天我们庆祝独立七周年。让我们回顾一下我们在抗战几年来的成就。遭受法国殖民主义者压迫和剥削了八十年的我国人民，在党的领导下，团结起来，勇敢地和敌人作坚决的斗争，取得了“八月革命”的胜利，建立了独立统一的越南民主共和国。我们的目的是要建设我们国家，使人民获得幸福。但法国殖民主义者偏要发动侵略战争，企图再一次地掠夺我们的领土、奴役我们的人民。他们使用一切极其恶毒的手段，杀害我们千千万万的同胞，毁灭我们成百成千的乡村，轰炸我们的堤坝，破坏我们的庄稼。面对着法国殖民主义者如此残暴的罪行，我们全国人民上下一致，坚决抗战。我们一面进行抗战，一面从事建设国家。由于我们热爱祖国的精神，由于我们人民发挥无比强大的力量，我们已克服了一切困难，获得了不少的成就。在军事方面，从一九五○年底到现在，我们军队连续获得了胜利。在敌后，游击战争的力量日益发展，游击区和游击根据地日益扩大。在经济方面，我们生产效率日见增加。增产节约计划得到全体同胞的热烈响应。政治方面，我们的胜利就更大了。在国内，全体人民日益密切地团结，越南国民联合战线日益巩固；人民、部队和干部都深刻地渗透了“抗战一定胜利，但抗战要长期、艰苦、和自力更生”的思想。在国外，我们和高棉人民、寮国人民间的兄弟般的友谊和合作日益紧密。我们在国际间的地位更提高了。此外，对我们抗战和建设事业起了重大影响的两个胜利，就是：整风和爱国竞赛。这两个运动正普遍地深入到我们的干部、部队和人民群众中去，并获得了良好的成绩。能取得这样的成绩，是由于党和政府政策的正确，由于人民和部队的英勇，由于绝大部分的干部是忠心耿耿、全心全意为人民服务的，尤其是我们在敌后的同胞、部队和干部那种轰轰烈烈的战斗精神。
    但我们切不要骄傲自满，还要更努力地去克服我们的缺点，发扬我们的优点，进而创造更大的成就。我们主要的缺点是有一些干部还不能很切实地去实现“勤、俭、廉、正”，还没有很正确地掌握党和政府的政策，还没有走群众路线，并缺乏全心全意为人民服务的精神。他们还沾染着官僚主义、命令主义和贪污浪费的恶劣作风。这些缺点已在进行增产节约运动和征收农业税、工商业税的工作中充分暴露出来。
    全体同胞、部队和干部们：
    法国殖民主义者、美国帝国主义干涉者及其走狗越奸傀儡们，正处在惶乱、困难和互相矛盾的状态中。他们是注定了要失败的，但他们越接近失败时就越发疯狂残暴。他们恶毒的阴谋是“以战养战”、
    “用越南人打越南人”的政策。他们正在敌占区加紧搜刮、劫夺、征兵、拉夫。他们还千方百计地破坏我们的经济。
    因此，我们愈接近胜利，困难就愈多；我们就更要坚决地去克服一切困难，来争取最后胜利。我们全体人民和军队、党和政府必须很好地完成下列任务：
    实现增产节约；
    推进和发展敌后的游击战争；
    整顿干部的思想与作风；
    整顿军队和增强部队的战斗力；
    准备整顿群众工作。
    在进行上述任务的同时，我们要造成一个切实实现“勤、俭、廉、正”和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。我们还要在各部门、各地方切实推动爱国竞赛运动。
    全体同胞、部队和干部们：
    我们能够完成上述的任务吗？一定能够完成的！法国殖民主义者，美国帝国主义干涉者及其傀儡们的势力正在走下坡路。而我们方面，经历了长期抗战，我们人民部队和干部经过了考验，变得更为坚决、强大。世界和平民主阵营的力量日益扩展。苏联、中国和各民主国家更加强大。各民主国家人民、法国人民、法国殖民地的人民和全世界的人民对我们的支援，一天比一天增多。因此，我们一定能够完成上述任务，从而作充分的准备以便转入总反攻，争取祖国的独立和统一，并在保卫世界和平的事业中作出更多的贡献。
    值此庆祝祖国独立纪念，我代表政府向：
    解放区、敌占区的同胞们和海外的侨胞们，
    各位爱国主义竞赛的英雄和模范们，
    人民军、地方部队、游击队、民兵的战士和干部们，
    各位荣军、病弱的兵员和军人烈士的家属们，
    政府机关和人民团体的干部和工作人员们，
    各位父老、青年和儿童们，致以亲爱的关怀和慰问。
    抗战一定胜利！
    越南独立、统一万岁！
    胡志明
    一九五二年九月一日
