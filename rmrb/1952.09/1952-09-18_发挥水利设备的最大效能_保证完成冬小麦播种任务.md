    Maximize the Effectiveness of Water Conservancy Equipment
    Guarantee the Completion of Winter Wheat Sowing Tasks
    Since July this year, rainfall in the major wheat-producing areas has generally been insufficient. In August, only the Shijiazhuang area of Hebei, the vicinity of Taiyuan in Shanxi, and the southeastern part of Pingyuan Province received rainfall of nearly 100 millimeters. Rainfall in other areas was less than 50 millimeters. Rainfall in July and August this year was only half of the average rainfall for the same period in previous years. Some counties in Henan have experienced very little rainfall for more than a month, and the drought situation is severe. In order to ensure the timely sowing of winter wheat, all localities should take effective measures as soon as possible.
    In areas with existing canal irrigation equipment and relatively sufficient river flow, this water conservancy should be fully utilized. In the past, irrigation management agencies often relaxed their management of water usage in the autumn. This year, attention should be paid to preventing this. In areas with smaller river flows, water should be used even more sparingly. Before watering, preparations such as leveling the land and preparing ridges should be made immediately, implementing economical water usage. Regardless of whether the area has abundant water or little water, the masses should be mobilized and organized to adopt various methods to expand the irrigation area as much as possible, while not affecting the water use of the original irrigation area. Governments at all levels should grasp the water situation in various places and formulate specific irrigation plans based on the needs of wheat planting to ensure the successful completion of wheat planting work.
    In areas with existing waterwheels and wells, mutual aid organizations for using water conservancy should be organized and developed in order to make full use of well water. For well-owning households who are unwilling to participate in mutual aid, they should be mobilized to formulate temporary methods with neighboring households without wells, allowing households without wells to use the surplus well water and giving the well-owning households reasonable compensation. In many places, there are already wells, but no waterwheels or other water-drawing tools. We should immediately mobilize and organize farmers to raise funds to purchase waterwheels and other water-drawing tools based on local conditions, or provide assistance with loans from the People's Government. Departments that sell and lend waterwheels should focus on these areas at present; cadres leading production should strengthen their leadership in this work. In short, we must do everything possible to maximize the effectiveness of water wells.

    发挥水利设备的最大效能
    保证完成冬小麦播种任务
    今年七月份以来，主要产麦地区的雨水都感不足。八月份只有河北石家庄一带、山西太原附近和平原省东南部分地区落雨近一百公厘，其他地区降雨量都不到五十公厘。今年七、八两月的降雨量只有历年同期平均雨量的一半。河南有几个县一个多月来雨水极少，旱象严重。为了保证冬小麦及时播种，各地应当及早采取有效的措施。
    在已有渠道灌溉设备和河水流量比较充足的地区，应当充分利用这些水利。过去各灌溉管理机构在秋季常常放松管理用水的工作，今年应当注意防止。在河水流量较小的地区，更要珍惜水量。在浇地前应即做好平地整畦等准备工作，实行经济用水。不论水多地区或水少地区，都要发动和组织群众，在不影响原灌区使水的原则下，采取各种方法，尽量扩大灌溉面积。各级政府应当掌握各地水量情况，根据种麦的需要，订出具体的灌溉计划，保证种麦工作胜利完成。
    在已有水车水井的地区，应当组织并发展使用水利的互助组织，以便充分利用井水。对于不愿意参加互助的有井户，应动员他们和地邻无井户拟定临时的办法，由无井户使用多余的井水，给予有井户以合理的报酬。有很多地方已有水井，但无水车或其他汲水工具，应即根据当地具体情况，动员和组织农民筹集款项，添置水车和其他汲水工具，或由人民政府贷款予以扶助。推销和出贷水车的部门，目前应以这类地区为工作重点；领导生产的干部更要加强领导这个工作。总之，要想尽一切办法，发挥水井的最大效能。
