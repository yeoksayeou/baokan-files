    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, in order to celebrate National Day and the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, issued a notice to industrial and commercial circles across the country, calling on industrialists and businessmen to actively improve production and management, deepen and expand the patriotic production increase and economy drive, and further organize themselves to strengthen learning. The full text of the notice is as follows:
    The great third anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China is approaching, and the people of the whole country are welcoming this festival with the greatest enthusiasm. In the past three years, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the face of our country's social economy has been completely renewed, construction undertakings have flourished, industrial and agricultural production has made considerable progress, urban and rural material exchanges have continued to expand, the entire national economy has fundamentally improved, and the lives of the broad masses of people are also improving day by day. In the future, our country will, on this victorious foundation, unfold large-scale production and construction in a planned way and rapidly move towards the road of industrialization. On the eve of this National Day, the Sino-Soviet talks were successfully concluded, and the strength of the Sino-Soviet alliance has become even stronger. The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will also be held in our capital, and the broad masses of peace-loving people will further unite closely and extensively to eliminate the threat of war, safeguard lasting peace in the Far East and the world, and strive to develop equal and mutually beneficial legitimate international economic relations. All of this will have a significant impact on our country's future economic construction and is closely related to the development of our legitimate industry and commerce. Therefore, this year's National Day is even more significant. Industrial and commercial federations at all levels should, together with other people's organizations, strengthen and expand publicity on the great achievements of the motherland in the past three years, and on the significance and role of the Sino-Soviet talks and the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, mobilize the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen to actively participate in the great national construction and the movement to defend peace, and celebrate our country's National Day and greet the victorious convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference with concrete actions; and in the future, more resolutely abide by the Common Program, according to the resolution of the Preparatory Representative Conference of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, actively improve production and management, deepen and expand the patriotic production increase and economy drive; and further organize themselves, strengthen learning, and conduct self-education and transformation. To this end, we propose the following points:
    First, deeply develop the patriotic production increase and economy drive. Our industrialists and businessmen, especially private industrialists and businessmen, should further develop their enthusiasm for production and management on the basis of the new public-private relations and labor-capital relations after the "Five-Anti" campaign. In terms of production, improve enterprise production management, promote advanced technology, reduce costs, and improve quality. Hold labor-capital consultation meetings, sign production contracts agreed upon by both parties, achieve obedience to the leadership and supervision of the working class, labor-capital unity, and do a good job in production; and assist in the implementation of labor employment, and strictly abide by the processing, ordering, or material exchange contracts that have been signed.
    At the same time, we should strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. Under the leadership of the state-owned economy, in cooperation with relevant government departments, we must promote all industrialists and businessmen to formulate practical purchase and sales plans according to the actual situation, actively participate in material exchange conferences in various places, and conduct transactions. Since this year's agricultural harvest is abundant and the peak market season after autumn is approaching, in order to prosper the urban and rural economy and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production, we should plan and step-by-step cooperate with market needs to purchase agricultural products, without suppressing prices or raising prices; and expand the sales of industrial products, implement the policy of "small profits but quick turnover," and meet the needs of urban and rural people. In terms of business style, we should establish new business ethics, strictly prevent the "five poisons," and achieve "facing the countryside" and "facing the consumer masses," thereby laying the foundation for expanding operations and expanding exchanges.
    Second, improve and gradually establish organizations at all levels. At present, the "General Rules for Industrial and Commercial Federation Organizations" have been promulgated and implemented by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. Industrial and commercial federations (or preparatory committees) in various places should, under the guidance of the local people's government, reorganize or consolidate industrial and commercial federations and trade associations at all levels in a planned and step-by-step manner, and should especially strengthen and improve grassroots organizations at all levels; in order to adapt to the development of the current economic situation and policy requirements.
    Finally, we must strengthen learning and conduct self-education and transformation. Industrialists and businessmen across the country must realize that we are a member of the Chinese people who are united and helping each other. As long as we are ideologically and practically in line with the interests of the people and contribute to national construction, we can move towards a happy future together with the people of the whole country. Therefore, we must transform our thinking, implement the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government through practice, and consciously no longer commit the "five poisons." At present, the enthusiasm for learning among industrialists and businessmen in various places is high, and industrial and commercial federations at all levels should grasp this situation well, actively promote and organize industrialists and businessmen to learn, formulate learning systems and learning plans, improve learning organizations, and maintain close contact with local people's governments and consultation committees. Preparations should be fully made in advance, and appropriate learning methods and methods should be formulated according to the level of education, so as to carry out smoothly and make timely summaries.
        In welcoming National Day and the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, industrialists and businessmen across the country must be full of confidence, take active action, do a good job in current tasks, and shoulder our responsibilities and contribute our strength to the great cause of building the motherland and defending peace.

    全国工商联筹委会号召工商业界
    以实际行动迎接国庆节和亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国工商业联合会筹备委员会为庆祝国庆暨亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，向全国工商业界发出通知，号召工商业者积极改进生产经营，深入与扩大爱国增产节约运动，并进一步组织起来加强学习。通知全文如下：
    伟大的中华人民共和国第三届国庆节即将到来，全国人民均以最大的热忱来迎接这个节日。三年来，我们国家在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，社会经济的面貌已焕然一新，建设事业蓬勃发展，工农业生产有了长足进步，城乡物资交流不断扩大，整个国家经济已根本好转，广大人民的生活亦正日益改善。今后我们国家将在这胜利的基础上，有计划地展开大规模的生产建设，迅速地向工业化的大道迈进。在这国庆节的前夕，中苏会谈胜利成功，中苏同盟力量更加强大。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议亦将在我国首都召开，广大的爱好和平的人民将进一步紧密与广泛地团结起来，以消灭战争威胁，保卫远东及世界持久和平，为发展平等互利的正当国际经济关系而努力。这一切，对今后我们国家经济大建设具有重大作用，与我们正当工商业的发展同样有着密切的关系。因此今年的国庆节，也就更有其重大的意义。各级工商业联合会应和其他人民团体一致，加强与扩大宣传祖国三年来的伟大成就，和关于中苏会谈以及亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开的意义与作用，动员广大的工商业者，积极参加伟大的国家建设和保卫和平的运动，以具体行动来庆祝我国今年的国庆节和迎接亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的胜利召开；并在今后更坚决地遵守共同纲领，根据中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议的决议，积极改进生产与经营，深入与扩大开展爱国增产节约运动；并进一步组织起来，加强学习，进行自我教育与改造。为此，我们提出下列几点：
    第一，深入开展爱国增产节约运动。我们工商业者，特别是私营工商业者，尤应在“五反”后新的公私关系及劳资关系的基础上，进一步发挥生产经营的积极性。在生产方面，改善企业生产管理，提倡先进技术，降低成本，提高品质。开好劳资协商会议，订立双方协议的生产合同，做到服从工人阶级的领导与监督，劳资团结，搞好生产；并协助劳动就业的进行，对已签订之加工订货或物资交流合同，应严格信守。
    同时，应加强城乡物资交流。必须在国营经济领导下，配合政府有关部门，推动全体工商业者，根据实际情况，制订切合实际的购销计划，积极参加各地物资交流大会，进行交易。由于今年农产丰收，秋后市场旺季已临，为繁荣城乡经济，推动工农业生产的发展，应有计划、有步骤地配合市场需要进行农产品的收购，不压价，不抬价；并扩大推销工业品，贯彻“薄利多销”的方针，满足城乡人民的需要。在经营作风方面，应树立新的商业道德，严格防止“五毒”，做到“面向农村”、“面向消费群众”，从而打下扩大经营、扩大交流的基础。
    第二，健全与逐步建立各级组织。目前“工商业联合会组织通则”，已由中央人民政府政务院公布施行。各地工商业联合会（或筹备会）应在当地人民政府指导下，有计划、有步骤地进行改组或整理各级工商业联合会及同业公会，特别应加强与健全各级基层机构；以适应当前经济形势的发展和政策要求。
    最后，必须加强学习，进行自我教育与改造。全国工商业者必须认识我们是中国人民中间团结互助的一分子，只要在思想上、行动上能与人民的利益相一致，对国家建设有所贡献，我们是能够和全国人民一道走向幸福的前途的。因此我们必须改造思想，从实践中来贯彻共同纲领及人民政府的政策法令，自觉地不再犯“五毒”。目前各地工商业者学习情绪是高涨的，各级工商业联合会应很好地掌握这个情况，积极推动与组织工商业者进行学习，订定学习制度及学习计划，健全学习组织，并与当地人民政府及协商委员会密切联系。事前并应充分做好准备，根据文化程度，订出适当的学习方式与方法，以便顺利开展，及时作出总结。
        全国工商业者在迎接国庆及亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议召开中，必须满怀信心，积极行动起来，做好当前各项工作，为建设祖国及保卫和平的伟大事业，担负起我们的责任，贡献出我们的力量。
