    Economic Life Brief Commentary
    Significant Contribution of Soviet Experts to China's Paper Industry
    Soviet expert V.V. Veletsky, based on the latest Soviet scientific theories and combined with the actual conditions of China's paper industry, and through the diligent experiments of workers at the Beijing Paper Mill, created the semi-pulp method for manufacturing paper from rice straw. This is a major event in China's paper industry. It has opened up a new path for the development of China's paper industry, once again proving that Soviet scientific theory is the most advanced. Only by learning from advanced Soviet experiences can we accelerate the development of our industry.

　　Papermaking was first invented in China. However, in the past, due to reactionary rule and imperialist economic aggression, China's paper industry, like other industries, had the characteristics of a colonial economy. The main raw material for papermaking—pulp—had to be imported from imperialist countries, and domestic paper production could not meet the needs.

　　Since liberation, China's paper industry has greatly developed. Last year, paper production more than doubled that of 1949, and increased by 38 percent compared to the highest historical output. However, due to the shortage of pulp supply, the equipment capacity of paper machines in some areas cannot be fully utilized. The development of the paper industry is still considerably restricted. We know that most of the world's pulp is made from wood. However, using wood to make pulp requires huge investment in equipment and a long construction period. During our construction period, wood has many uses and it is impossible to supply large quantities for papermaking. Therefore, how to use China's infinitely rich grass fibers to make pulp and paper has become a pressing problem to be solved in the paper industry. Now Soviet experts are helping us to begin to solve this problem. We deeply thank Comrade Veletsky and the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to the Chinese people.

    苏联专家对中国造纸工业的重大贡献
    苏联专家威烈基金根据苏联最新的科学理论，结合着中国造纸工业的实际情况，经过北京造纸厂工人的努力试验，创造了稻草制造半料浆法，这是中国造纸工业中的一件大事。它开辟了我国造纸工业发展的新道路，再一次证明苏联的科学理论是最先进的。我们只有学习苏联先进经验，才能使我们的工业发展速度加快。
　　造纸是中国最先发明的，但是，过去由于反动统治和帝国主义经济侵略的结果，中国的造纸工业和其他工业一样带着殖民地经济的特点，主要的造纸原料——纸浆，要依靠从帝国主义国家输入，而且国内纸张产量，也不能满足需要。
　　解放以后，我国造纸工业有了很大的发展，去年纸张产量比一九四九年增加了一倍以上，比历史上最高产量也增加了百分之三十八。但是，由于纸浆供应的不足，若干地区造纸机的设备能力尚不能充分发挥。造纸工业的发展还受相当束缚。我们知道世界各国的纸浆大部是用木材原料制造的。但利用木材制浆需要庞大的投资设备及长时间的建设；而我国在建设期间，木材的用途很大，不可能大量供应造纸。因此如何利用我国无限丰富的草类纤维来制浆造纸就成为造纸工业一个急待解决的问题。现在苏联专家帮助我们开始解决了这个问题。我们深深感谢威烈基金同志和苏联人民对中国人民的无私的援助。
