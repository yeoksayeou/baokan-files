    Thoroughly Eliminate the Influence of the Pseudo-Civil Code's "Family Law" and Safeguard the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Women in New China
    Wang Ruqi
    The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference clearly stipulates in Article 6: "The People's Republic of China abolishes the feudal system that binds women. Women have equal rights with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, educational, and social life. Freedom of marriage between men and women shall be implemented." However, judicial personnel with old legal views, especially those old judicial personnel who had long served in Kuomintang courts and were retained after liberation without transformation, intentionally or unintentionally handled marriage cases and cases related to women in accordance with the provisions of the Kuomintang "Civil Code's" "Family Law," which maintained feudalism and oppressed women. They regarded women as slaves or cheap commodities, arbitrarily deprived them of their legitimate rights and interests, and insulted their personal dignity. This not only suppressed women's enthusiasm for participating in national construction but also directly and indirectly forced many women to lose their lives. In feudal Chinese society, the rulers, in order to maintain the order of their feudal patriarchal society, not only suppressed women with feudal political power, clan power, and divine power but also trampled on women with feudal husband power. Parents regarded their children as their own property, and the system of forced, arranged, and bought marriages arose from this. Love between men and women was regarded as "utterly outrageous," and offenders were given charges such as "disrupting public morals," "enticement," and "adultery."
    The Kuomintang "Civil Code's" "Family Law" inherited this cannibalistic "code of ethics" from the feudal ruling classes of China, and judicial personnel with old legal views currently regard it as the golden rule. As long as a marriage is so-called "arranged through proper channels," even if both parties do not agree, it is considered "legal"; conversely, if it is not approved by the parents, even if the man and woman voluntarily marry, it is considered "illegal," not recognized, and even forcibly broken up. Especially for men and women who have had sexual relations before marriage, even if they have never been married, or have no partners now, or are suffering from the persecution of feudal marriages, marriage is not allowed under any circumstances; those who are already married must be forcibly separated and sentenced for "adultery." Wan Yunshou, a laboring citizen in Nanjing, was preparing to marry Wang Suzhen (18 years old), a mistreated child bride who lived next door, with whom he was in love. The North District People's Court of Nanjing sentenced him to eight months in prison for the crime of "enticement." The basis for this was that "if a third party has a love affair with one of the engaged men or women, it is an obstruction to others." Isn't this clearly maintaining the feudal system of child brides? (This case was later corrected by the Nanjing People's Court.)
    On the issue of divorce, the Kuomintang "Civil Code's" "Family Law" superficially recognized that both men and women have the freedom to divorce, but it stipulated ten harsh clauses, virtually depriving women of their freedom to divorce. It stipulates that one party being subjected to abuse that makes cohabitation unbearable by the other party is one of the reasons for divorce. However, in actual judgments, it follows the precedents or interpretations of the reactionary Beiyang government's Supreme Court (note), which held that "forcible marriage in the early stages" cannot be used as a reason for divorce. If women can be snatched like objects and it does not count as "abuse," and they are not allowed to divorce, then what else can be considered "unbearable cohabitation"? The "Family Law" stipulates that a woman being subjected to abuse by her parents-in-law to the point of unbearable cohabitation is one of the reasons for divorce. However, according to the pseudo-Supreme Court's interpretation, a woman being abused by her parents-in-law "unless it results in fracture or severe disability" cannot request a divorce; moreover, if the husband only knows that his parents have abused his wife but has not participated himself, it cannot constitute a reason for divorce. Thus, parents-in-law beating their daughters-in-law is protected by reactionary law. Although bigamy can constitute a reason for divorce, according to the pseudo-Supreme Court's interpretation, "taking a concubine is not marriage and cannot be a reason for divorce." Thus, as long as taking a concubine does not involve a "public ceremony," it does not count as "bigamy." This series of examples fully exposes the hypocrisy of the so-called "freedom of divorce" in the pseudo-law.
    In our People's Courts, personnel with old legal views are actually citing these clauses when handling divorce cases. They turn a blind eye to the feudal oppression suffered by women, demanding this and that condition from divorcing women, and some even create their own "laws" with as many as twenty or thirty articles. They insult women who request divorce, forcibly "mediate," to the point that some women are forced to return home with their husbands and are then murdered. Yu Zhangying, a woman from Quanjiao County, Anhui Province, filed for divorce because she could not bear the abuse of her husband and mother-in-law. A staff member of the county's People's Court even used the so-called "the plaintiff Yu Zhangying does not observe the virtues of a maiden" as a reason, believing that "this woman should be severely punished and not allowed to divorce in order to continue the family line." Isn't this blatantly standing on the side of the feudal marriage system?
    In addition, there are many cases where feudal abuse of women is met with "no action without a complaint," "no acceptance without a written complaint," and delays in judgment after acceptance. This situation has led many women to commit suicide or be abused to death out of despair. Particularly serious is that some untransformed old judicial personnel openly protect the "husband's rights" of counter-revolutionaries and do not allow the woman to divorce. In feudal society, the relationship between husband and wife was actually the relationship between slave owner and slave. Under the so-called "civilized" legal system of capitalism, marriage is actually regarded as a "contractual relationship" of a buying and selling nature. This "contractual relationship" cannot be equal because of women's economic subordination. As Engels said, when a large amount of wealth is concentrated in the hands of men, in order to maintain the right of property centered on men, women are required to unilaterally maintain chastity, while men can arbitrarily play with women. (Reference: Engels, "The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State," Chapter 2) Therefore, polygamy is actually tolerated and protected by reactionary laws. During the Kuomintang period, men in the landlord, bureaucrat-comprador bourgeoisie could invoke the precedents of the pseudo-Supreme Court to use the wife's violation of the "seven grounds for divorce" (i.e., so-called disobedience to parents, childlessness, licentiousness, jealousy, incurable disease, talkativeness, theft) as a reason for divorce, or to divorce women they were "tired of playing with" by paying "alimony." They could also invoke the pseudo-law "Family Law" to casually patronize prostitutes or take concubines ("Family Law" actually recognized concubines as "family members" living together), as long as the wife did not report it within a certain period, it would not be considered a crime. In fact, women had no economic status and were bound by feudal ideology, so they had to swallow their anger when faced with such things; even if they sued in the pseudo-court, it would be in vain. Because the pseudo-court imposed extremely light sentences, or even no sentences, on the perpetrators when handling cases of trampling on women's rights.
    In our People's Courts, some people are judging cases according to this kind of reactionary old legal view. Zhang Shoumei, a businessman from Changsha, married another woman, Ye Mengping, under the pretext that his wife did not give birth to a son. After the marriage, the relationship was not good, and Ye filed for divorce. Mei Zhongtao, an old judicial staff member of the Changsha People's Court, not only did not hold the man accountable for committing bigamy but instead blamed the woman for "cohabitating with a married man and destroying someone else's family." He Lai'suo from Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, inserted lime and arsenic into his wife's vagina, killing her, but the Shanxi Provincial People's Court considered it "manslaughter" and gave him a light sentence. May I ask, what is the actual difference between these judicial personnel and the judges of the Kuomintang era? In addition, some judicial personnel also condone criminals who force their wives into prostitution or traffic women, allowing them to roam free. In Beijing, there were cases of wives being sold to brothels three times in a row without punishment from the People's Court. In the era of reactionary rule, the so-called women's "property rights" were actually just empty words. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China resolutely protects women's independent property rights. However, some judicial personnel have always regarded family property as the sole property of the man, denying that husband and wife have equal property rights in the family. When handling divorce cases, they adopt a "no action without a complaint" attitude toward women who are afraid of not being able to divorce or do not know that women have property rights and do not make property claims; when women request to take property after divorce in accordance with the law, they dismiss the matter under the pretext of "a matter is not handled twice." Even if a small amount of property is awarded to women, it is given as the man's "gift" to the woman or as the "alimony" stipulated by the Kuomintang "Family Law." When the Pingyuan Province Wenxian People's Court ruled on the divorce case of Wang Cuiying, the policy was to "try to persuade the woman not to take property." In the end, the woman and her child were awarded two mu of land and three dilapidated houses, but no grain or property was given. The woman had nothing to eat and was forced to sell her child, and she herself died the next day. When the Wenxian Women's Federation questioned the court, the cadre who handled the case righteously said that the woman did not request to take grain, so the court could not rule that she should take it.
    In short, among some judicial personnel in our People's Courts, the old legal view of depriving women of their legitimate rights and interests is very serious. In handling many cases, they have completely violated the spirit of equality between men and women, freedom of marriage, and protection of women's interests stipulated in the "Common Program" and the "Marriage Law." For the liberation of all Chinese women, and to increase the strength of national construction, we must thoroughly expose and eliminate all old legal views that trample on women's legitimate rights and interests in the current judicial reform movement, and give those criminals who seriously persecute women the sanctions of the law.

    彻底肃清伪民法“亲属编”的影响
    保障新中国妇女的合法权益
    王汝琪
    中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第六条明文规定：“中华人民共和国废除束缚妇女的封建制度。妇女在政治的、经济的、文化教育的、社会的生活各方面，均有与男子平等的权利。实行男女婚姻自由。”可是，具有旧法观点的司法人员，尤其是那些过去长期在国民党法院任职而留用后又未经改造的旧司法人员，却有意无意地按照国民党“民法”的“亲属编”中维护封建、压迫妇女的规定，处理婚姻案件和有关妇女的案件。他们把妇女看作奴隶或廉价的商品，任意剥夺妇女的合法权益，侮辱妇女的人格，不仅压抑了妇女参加国家建设事业的积极性，而且直接间接地迫使不少妇女丧失了生命。一中国封建社会的统治者为了维护其封建宗法社会的秩序，除以封建的政权、族权和神权压制妇女外，并以封建的夫权蹂躏妇女。父母视子女为自己的财产，强迫、包办、买卖的婚姻制度由此产生。男女恋爱被视为“大逆不道”，违者便加以“妨碍风化”、“拐骗”、“通奸”等罪名。
    国民党“民法”的“亲属编”继承了中国历代封建统治阶级的这种吃人的“礼教”，而目前具有旧法观点的司法人员却奉之为金科玉律。只要是所谓“明媒正娶”的婚姻，即使结婚双方都不同意，也一概认为“合法”；反之，如果未经父母同意，则纵令男女双方自愿结婚，也一概认为“不合法”，不予承认，甚至强制拆散。尤其对于结婚前发生了性关系的男女，尽管他们都没有结过婚，或者现在都没有对象，或者正在遭受着封建婚姻的迫害，也一概不许结婚；已经结了婚的，就要强迫拆散，并判处“通奸”罪。南京市劳动市民万云寿因与邻居受虐待的童养媳王素珍（十八岁）恋爱，准备结婚，南京市北区人民法院竟以“诱拐”为罪名判以八个月徒刑。根据是“第三者若与已订婚的男女之一方来往恋爱就是妨害他人”。这不是明显地在维护封建的童养媳制度吗？（此案后经南京市人民法院纠正）
    在离婚问题上，国民党“民法”的“亲属编”表面上承认男女双方都有离婚自由，但却规定了十个苛刻的条款，把妇女的离婚自由实际上剥夺殆尽。它规定男女一方受了另一方不堪同居的虐待为离婚理由之一，但在实际判决中，则按反动的北洋政府大理院判例或解释例（注），认为“先期强娶”不能作为离婚的理由。妇女既然可以像东西一样被人抢夺而不算“虐待”，不许离婚，还有什么可以算作“不堪同居”呢？“亲属编”规定妇女受公婆虐待到不堪同居的程度为离婚理由之一，但按伪大理院的解释例，妇女被公婆虐待“非至折伤或废笃疾”（即被打断手足或打成残废重病）不得请求离婚；而且如果丈夫只知道公婆对妻有虐待行为而自己未曾参与，也不能构成离婚理由。这样，公婆殴打媳妇是受到反动法律保护的。重婚虽可构成离婚的理由，但按伪最高法院的解释，“娶妾并非婚姻，不能为离婚之原因”。于是娶妾的只要不用“公开仪式”，就不算作“重婚”。这一连串的事例，充分暴露了伪法中的所谓“离婚自由”的虚伪性。
    在我们的人民法院中，那些具有旧法观点的人员在处理离婚案件时，实际也是引用着这些条款。他们对于妇女所遭受的封建压迫熟视无睹，向离婚妇女要这个条件，那个条件，有的甚至自订“法条”至二、三十条之多。他们辱骂要求离婚的妇女，强行“调解”，以致有的妇女被迫随夫回家后，遭到丈夫的残杀。安徽省全椒县妇女余章英不堪丈夫和婆婆的虐待，提出离婚。该县人民法院某工作人员竟以所谓“原告余章英不守闺业”为理由，认为应该“严惩此妇，毋容离异，以继宗支”。这不是明目张胆地站在封建婚姻制度的立场上了吗？
    此外，对妇女遭受封建虐害的事件采取“不告不理”、“无诉状不受理”、以及受理后拖延不判的也很多。这种情形，使不少妇女因绝望而自杀，或被虐杀。尤其严重的，是有些未经改造的旧司法人员竟公然保障反革命分子的“夫权”而不许女方离婚。二在封建社会里，夫妻关系实际是奴隶主与奴隶的关系。在资本主义的所谓“文明的”法制下，婚姻实际被认为是一种买卖性质的“契约关系”。这种“契约关系”又因妇女在经济上的从属地位而不可能是平等的。正如恩格斯所说，当大量财富集中到男子手中的时候，为了保持以男子为中心的财产权，就要求妇女片面地守贞操，而男子却可以任意玩弄妇女。（参考恩格斯：“家族、私有财产及国家的起源”第二章）因之，一夫多妻制实际是被容许并受到反动法律的保护的。在国民党时期，地主、官僚买办资产阶级中的男子，可以援用伪大理院的判例以妻犯“七出”（即所谓不孝父母、无子、淫佚、妒嫉、恶疾、多言、窃盗）为离婚理由，或以支付“赡养费”的形式离掉“玩”厌了的妇女。也可以援用伪法“亲属编”而随便宿娼、纳妾（“亲属编”实际承认妾为同居之“家属”），只要妻在一定期限内不予举发，即不算犯罪。事实上，妇女既无经济地位，又受封建思想的束缚，碰到这样的事，不得不忍气吞声；即令告到伪法院，也是徒然。因为伪法院在处理蹂躏妇女人权的案件时，对凶手处刑极轻，甚至不予处刑。
    在我们人民法院中，有一些人就是按这种反动的旧法观点判案的。长沙商人张寿梅以妻不生男孩为藉口，与另一妇女叶梦萍结婚。婚后感情不好，叶提出离婚。长沙市人民法院旧司法人员梅忠桃不仅不以男方犯重婚罪论处，反责备女方“与有妇之夫同居，是破坏别人的家庭”。山西省文水县和来锁以石灰、砒信塞入妻子阴户，将妻害死，而山西省人民法院却认为是“过失杀人”，予以轻判。请问这些司法人员和国民党时代的法官有何实际的分别？此外，有些司法人员还纵容逼妻为娼或贩卖妇女的罪犯，任他们逍遥法外。北京市有连续将妻卖到妓院三次而人民法院不予处罚者。三在反动统治时代，所谓妇女“财产权”实际只是一句空话。中华人民共和国的婚姻法则是坚决保护妇女独立的财产权的。但有一部分司法人员，却一直把家庭财产看作男方独有的财产，否定夫妻在家庭中有平等的财产权。他们在处理离婚案件时，对于那些唯恐不能离婚或不知妇女有财产权而未提出财产要求的妇女，采取“不告不理”的态度；妇女在离婚后又依法要求带产时，则以“一事不再理”为藉口，推出了事。即或判给妇女少量财产，也是当作男方对女方的“恩赐”或当做国民党“亲属编“所规定的“赡养费”来付予。平原省温县人民法院在判决妇女王翠英离婚案时，方针是“尽量动员女方不带财产”。最后判给女方和孩子二亩地和三间破房，粮食财物一概不给。女方没有吃的，被迫把孩子卖掉，第二天自己也死去了。当温县妇联质问法院时，处理此案的干部还理直气壮地说，女方没有提出带粮食，法院就不能判她带。
    总之，在我们人民法院的一部分司法人员中，剥夺妇女合法权益的旧法观点是非常严重的。他们在处理许多案件中，完全违背了“共同纲领”及“婚姻法”中所规定的男女平等、婚姻自由，保护妇女利益的精神。为了全中国妇女的解放，为了增加国家建设的力量，我们必须在当前的司法改革运动中彻底揭发和肃清一切蹂躏妇女合法权益的旧法观点，并给那些严重地迫害妇女的罪犯以法律的制裁。
