Challenge Letter from Nine State-Run Mechanized Farms

We, the nine state-run mechanized farms, enthusiastically respond to the call of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government to carry out the 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition. We guarantee to fully prepare for winter wheat sowing, strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest of winter wheat next year on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, produce more and better grain for the country, strengthen the country's economic construction, and jointly launch this challenge to brother farms in the winter wheat producing areas of the country. We welcome everyone to actively respond to the challenge and actively carry out the 1953 winter wheat patriotic production increase competition.

Our conditions for initiating the competition are as follows:

I. Adopt advanced Soviet farming methods. Use tractors with small plowshares to cultivate the land, ensuring a cultivation depth of no less than 22 centimeters.

II. Adopt advanced narrow-row, sparse-sowing, and dense-planting methods. Appropriately increase the amount of seeds sown, preparing to sow 400,000 seeds per mu to improve land utilization.

III. Select high-yielding, large and heavy-grained, disease-resistant, and cold-resistant superior varieties. Before sowing, treat the seeds with chemicals to prevent diseases. Correctly grasp the sowing period so that the wheat can establish good roots and grow good tillers before winter. In the coming spring, as soon as the ground thaws, implement early spring harrowing to promote wheat growth.

IV. Apply fertilizers rationally. Apply sufficient stable manure as base fertilizer before sowing. In the coming spring, according to the needs of each growth and development stage of wheat, apply fast-acting chemical fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate in stages, and appropriately apply phosphorus and potassium fertilizers.

V. Require that the unit area yield of winter wheat in 1953 increase by 50% compared with the average yield in 1952, and create new records of high-yield bumper harvests.

VI. Establish close ties with local farmers, mutual aid teams, and agricultural production cooperatives. Summarize advanced production experience in a timely manner and promote it to farmers.

Our conditions for initiating the challenge competition are as follows:

I. Implement early plowing, deep plowing and fine harrowing. According to different conditions, we generally plow ordinary wheat fields two to three times, with a depth of five to seven inches. High-yield wheat fields are plowed three to seven times, with a depth of six inches to one foot. Cultivate and weed once to three times.

II. Appropriately increase the amount of seeds sown and adopt narrow-row sparse sowing or wide-row strip sowing dense planting method. Sow in a timely manner.

III. Adopt varieties suitable for the local area. Conduct warm water soaking and chemical seed dressing before sowing.

    一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动的挑战书
    九个国营机耕农场的挑战书
    我们九个国营机耕农场热烈响应中央人民政府农业部开展一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动的号召，保证充分做好冬小麦播种前的各项准备工作，在今年丰产的胜利基础上，争取明年冬小麦全面丰收，为国家生产更多更好的粮食，加强国家经济建设的力量，并以此联名向全国冬小麦产区的兄弟农场发起挑战，欢迎大家踊跃应战，积极开展一九五三年度冬小麦爱国增产竞赛运动。
    我们发起竞赛的条件如下：
    一、采用苏联先进耕作法。使用带小铧犁的拖拉机耕地，保证耕地深度不少于二十二公分。
    二、采用先进窄行疏播的密植方法。适当地增加播种量，准备每亩播种四十万粒，以提高土地利用率。
    三、选用产量高的、粒大而重的、抗病力强的、能耐寒的优良品种。播种前，用药剂拌种，以防病害。正确掌握播种期，使小麦在冬前扎好根，长好分蘖。来年春天地刚解冻，及时实施早春耙苗，以促进小麦生长。
    四、合理施用肥料。在播种前施用足量的厩肥作基肥。来年春天，根据小麦各个生长发育阶段的需要，分期施用速效性化学肥料如硫酸铔等，并适当施用磷、钾素肥料。
    五、要求一九五三年度冬小麦单位面积产量较一九五二年平均产量提高百分之五十，并创造高额丰产新纪录。
    六、与当地农民、互助组、农业生产合作社建立密切联系。及时总结先进生产经验，向农民推广。

    三、采用产量高、抗病力强的良种。播种前经过风筛、盐水选种，并用药剂拌种。播种后贯彻防重于治的方针，积极防治病、虫害。
    四、分期合理施肥。播种前施用厩肥、豆饼、骨粉等为基肥，播种后根据小麦生长发育的需要，分期追施豆饼、人粪尿、硫酸铔等肥料。
    五、注意培育小麦优良品种，并向当地农民推广先进生产经验。
    六、根据我们三个农场的不同情况，要求全部麦田平均产量比一九五二年增加三成到五成，比当地农民超过五成；并划出一部分为丰产田，创造小麦丰产新纪录。
