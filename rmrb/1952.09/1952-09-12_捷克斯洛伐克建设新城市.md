Czechoslovakia is building a new coal mine and chemical industrial city near Most in northern Bohemia. In the coming years, it will become a paradise for 40,000 workers to work and live in.

	A three-kilometer-long road will run through the center of the city, connecting the city's three large squares. Six new workers' residential areas will be built throughout the city, each with its own park, sports field, school, and kindergarten. The main building in the city will be a fifteen-story building. It is the office building of the local government and state-owned enterprises. In addition, there is a ten-story hotel, a department store, a post office, and a modern cultural and sports center.

	Residential construction began in 1950, and many residents have already moved into new homes in seven residential areas. By October of this year, another 556 new homes will also be completed.

	All newly built houses are equipped with laundry rooms, bathrooms and all other modern facilities.

	Czechoslovak workers have shown great enthusiasm for building this industrial city. Many workers volunteered to join shock work teams. The vast majority of residents have pledged to contribute 200,000 work hours to the city's construction.

    捷克斯洛伐克建设新城市
    在捷克斯洛伐克北部波希米亚附近的摩斯特地方，正在兴建一座新的煤矿与化学工业城市。在今后数年内，它将成为四万名工人的工作和生活的乐园。
    一条三公里长的公路将贯串这个城市的中心，将市内的三个大广场联接起来。全市将建立起六个新的工人住宅区，每一个住宅区都要有自己的公园、运动场、学校和幼儿园。市内的主要建筑物，将是一幢十五层高的大楼。它是地方政府与国营企业的办公大厦。此外，还有一个十层楼的旅馆，一个百货公司，一个邮局和一个现代化的文化体育馆。
    住宅的建筑开始于一九五○年，现在已有许多居民搬进了七个住宅区的新居。到今年十月，另外的五百五十六幢新住宅也将要完工。
    所有新建的房屋都设有洗衣室、浴室和其他一切现代化的设备。
    捷克斯洛伐克的工人们对于兴建这个工业城市，表现了高度的热情。许多工人自愿参加了突击工作队。极大部分的居民保证要在建设城市工作中献出二十万个工时。
