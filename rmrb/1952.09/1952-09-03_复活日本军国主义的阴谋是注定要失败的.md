Today is the seventh anniversary of the victory of the great War of Resistance Against Japan. We respectfully wish that the spirit of the countless martyrs who heroically sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan will live forever! We express our deep gratitude to the powerful socialist country, the Soviet Union, for the great assistance it gave to the Chinese people during the War of Resistance Against Japan.

The Chinese and Asian people, who suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression, will never forget their deep hatred for Japanese militarism. However, in the seven years since the defeat of Japanese militarism, the development of the situation in Japan under the rule of American imperialism has completely violated the wishes of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and also the wishes of the Japanese people.

Since September of last year, the United States has arbitrarily signed a separate "peace treaty" with Japan, the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" and the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," placing Japan under long-term U.S. military occupation, economic plunder, and political oppression. Its purpose is to make Japan its colony and accomplice in aggression against Asia. This plan of American imperialist elements to turn Japan into an accomplice in their aggression against Asia has been enthusiastically supported by Japanese militarist elements represented by Yoshida. Although Japanese militarist elements suffered a heavy defeat in World War II, they are still unwilling to accept defeat; they dream of following the United States, relying on the United States to prepare to launch a new war of aggression, in order to rebuild the so-called Second Japanese Empire. Facts in the past year have shown that the Yoshida government, under the guise of expanding the police force, is actively restoring the Japanese army and navy; releasing a large number of war criminals and re-employing old fascist officers; beginning to restore the large-scale production of heavy weapons such as airplanes and tanks; and suppressing domestic national liberation movements, rebuilding the fascist political system with the "Subversive Activities Prevention Act" as its main content. All this shows the conspiracy of American imperialist elements and Japanese militarist elements to actively revive Japanese militarism. On August 1st this year, Japan even established a disguised military department—the Japan Security Agency. The current Prime Minister of Japan, Yoshida, even served concurrently as the first director-general of the agency, and on the 4th, he made a rampant speech to cadres above the section chief level, saying: "You must become the backbone of the establishment of a new national army... The United States hopes that the Japanese people will lead Asia." This is an open provocation by Japanese militarist elements, supported by American imperialist elements, against the Chinese people and all Asian people.

It is absolutely necessary for this small group of desperadoes who dare to provoke the Asian people to review the lessons of the past failures of Japanese imperialism today. On July 7, 1937, Japanese imperialism fully launched its war of aggression against China. At that time, the Chinese people were under the extremely corrupt and reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek, and Japanese imperialism妄想wished to conquer all of China in a short period of time. However, history has proven that China was not conquered, but Japanese imperialism completely failed. At that time, simply because the Chinese Communist Party persisted in resisting Japan in the enemy's rear, Japanese imperialism was plunged into the quagmire of the war of aggression and could not extricate itself, eventually leading to its own demise. Today, the situation in China and Asia has undergone fundamental changes compared to the past.

The victory of the anti-fascist war in World War II changed the world situation and also changed the situation in Asia. The establishment of the People's Republic of China has played a decisive role in fundamentally changing the situation in Asia. The power unleashed by the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party is far greater than that of China before World War II. In addition, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which aims at "preventing renewed aggression and disruption of peace by Japan or any other state directly or indirectly colluding with Japan in acts of aggression" between China and the Soviet Union, its power is incomparably great. If the imperialists dare to launch an attack on it, it will undoubtedly give the imperialists a thorough and crushing blow.

In addition, since the end of World War II, the situations in Korea, Vietnam, and Southeast Asian countries have also undergone major changes, which are unfavorable to imperialism and far different from the situation before World War II. The domestic situation in Japan has also undergone major changes, and the Japanese people have become more awakened than ever before. The Japanese people's struggle against foreign occupation and the revival of Japanese militarism is of great significance for defending peace in the East and the world.

All of the above factors did not exist in Asia before the end of World War II. These factors have changed and are continuing to change the historical face of Asia. The era of imperialism running rampant in Asia is gone forever.

Can American imperialism's interference in Asia and its support for Japanese militarism change this situation in Asia? Obviously not. American imperialism treats Japan as an employer, and is American imperialism any better than the German fascists, the past allies of Japanese imperialism? The fact that American imperialism was forced to accept armistice negotiations a year after launching the Korean War has already answered this question. Therefore, the conspiracy of American imperialist elements and their running dogs in Japan—Japanese militarist elements headed by Yoshida—to revive Japanese militarism will not only fail to lead the Japanese nation to revival, but is also doomed to failure and will first destroy Japan itself.

Japanese militarist elements, whether in the past, present, or future, are the enemies of the Chinese people; but the Japanese people have always been friends of the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, the Japanese people have always persisted in a heroic struggle against the Yoshida reactionary government's policy of assisting American imperialism in reviving Japanese militarism and dragging Japan onto the road to destruction. A major feature of the new situation in Japan in the past year has been the new upsurge of the Japanese people's movement for independence, democracy, and peace. This struggle of the Japanese people for the independence, democracy, and peace of their motherland is entirely in line with the interests of the Japanese nation. Due to the intensified control of Japan by American imperialism and the rise of militarism in Japan, every Japanese citizen has been forced to consider the future of the nation. Today, there are clearly two completely different paths before the Japanese nation: either unite all patriotic forces in the country, expel foreign occupiers, overthrow the traitorous Yoshida government, and establish equal, friendly, and mutually beneficial relations with all peace-loving and democratic countries and peoples in the world, thereby creating an independent, democratic, peaceful, and prosperous new Japan; or act as an accomplice of American imperialism in its aggression against Asia, once again become enemies with the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world, and plunge the Japanese nation into a situation of destruction. Today, the Japanese people are increasingly widely and resolutely choosing the former path. This struggle of the Japanese people is receiving the warm support of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and therefore it is bound to win. And the Japanese militarist elements who choose the latter path are destined to fail.

The Chinese people have always adhered to a policy of peace. We are willing to establish relationships of mutual respect, non-aggression, peaceful coexistence, equality and friendship, as well as autonomous trade and cultural exchanges with the Japanese people. The Chinese people are willing to work with all peace-loving patriots in Japan to fight for the defense of peace in the Far East and against the revival of Japanese militarism. The upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference will further unite the people of the Asian and Pacific regions to jointly fight to stop aggressive forces and defend peace in the Asian and Pacific regions.

### 复活日本军国主义的阴谋是注定要失败的

    复活日本军国主义的阴谋是注定要失败的
    今天是伟大的抗日战争胜利日七周年纪念。我们谨祝在抗日战争中英勇牺牲的无数烈士们的精神永垂不朽！我们对于强大的社会主义国家苏联，在抗日战争中给予中国人民的巨大援助，表示深切的感谢。
    身受日本帝国主义侵略的中国人民和亚洲人民，永远也不能忘记对于日本军国主义的深刻仇恨。可是日本军国主义被击溃后的七年来，在美国帝国主义统治下的日本形势的发展，完全违背了中国人民、亚洲人民的愿望；也完全违背了日本人民的愿望。
    去年九月以来，美国擅自签订单独对日“和约”、
    “美日安全条约”与“美日行政协定”，使日本处于美国的长期的军事占领、经济掠夺与政治压迫之下。它的目的，就是要使日本成为它的殖民地和侵略亚洲的帮凶。美国帝国主义分子变日本为其侵略亚洲帮凶的这个计划，是得到以吉田为代表的日本军国主义分子的狂热支持的。日本军国主义分子，虽然在第二次世界大战中遭受了惨重的失败，然而他们至今还不甘心于失败；他们梦想追随美国，依靠美国准备发动新的侵略战争，以重建所谓第二日本帝国。最近一年来的事实表明，吉田政府借用扩充警察的名义，积极恢复日本的陆军与海军；释放大批战犯，起用旧的法西斯军官；开始恢复飞机、坦克等重武器的大规模生产；镇压国内的民族解放运动，以“防止破坏活动法案”为主要内容来重建法西斯的政治体制。所有这些，都说明了美国帝国主义分子与日本军国主义分子，积极复活日本军国主义的阴谋。今年八月一日，日本更成立了变相的军部——日本保安厅。日本现任首相吉田，竟以兼任该厅第一任长官的身份，于四日向该厅科长以上干部发表狂妄的谈话说：“你们要成为建立新国军的骨干。……美国希望领导亚洲的是日本国民。”这是美国帝国主义分子支持下的日本军国主义分子，向中国人民、全亚洲人民的公开挑衅。
    对于这一小撮敢于向亚洲人民挑衅的亡命之徒，让他们在今天温习一下过去日本帝国主义失败的教训，是完全必要的。一九三七年七月七日，日本帝国主义全面地发动了对于中国的侵略战争，当时中国人民处在蒋介石极端腐朽的反动统治之下，日本帝国主义妄想在短时期内征服全中国。可是历史证明：中国没有被征服，而日本帝国主义却完全失败了，当时仅仅由于有中国共产党在敌后坚持抗战，就使日本帝国主义陷入侵略战争的泥淖而不能自拔，终于自取覆灭。今天中国与亚洲的情况，比起从前来，早已发生了根本的变化。
    第二次世界大战由于反法西斯战争的胜利改变了世界的形势，也改变了亚洲的形势。中华人民共和国的成立，对于根本改变亚洲形势，起着决定性的作用。中国人民在毛泽东主席与中国共产党的领导下所发挥起来的力量，远非第二次世界大战前的中国可比，再加上中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，这一条约，是以中苏两国共同“制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平”为目的的，它的力量是无可比拟的伟大。如果帝国主义者敢于向它发动进攻，它将给帝国主义者以彻底粉碎的打击，是毫无疑问的。
    此外，第二次世界大战结束以后，朝鲜、越南以及东南亚各国的形势也已有了重大的变化，而不利于帝国主义，也远非第二次世界大战前的形势可比。日本国内的形势更有了重大的变化，日本人民已比过去任何时候都更觉醒起来了。日本人民反对外国占领与日本军国主义复活的斗争，对于保卫东方与世界和平，是有伟大的意义的。
    所有以上因素，都是在第二次世界大战结束以前的亚洲所不存在的。这些因素，已经改变了并正在继续改变着亚洲的历史面貌。帝国主义横行亚洲的时代，已经一去不复返了。
    美国帝国主义对于亚洲的干涉与对于日本军国主义的支持，是否能够改变亚洲这种形势呢？显然是不能的。美国帝国主义是以雇主的态度来对待日本的，而且比起日本帝国主义过去的同盟者德国法西斯来，难道美帝国主义是更出色的吗？美帝国主义在发动侵略朝鲜战争的一年以后，不得不被迫接受停战谈判的事实，就已经答复了这个问题。所以，美国帝国主义分子及其在日本的走狗——以吉田为首的日本军国主义分子，企图复活日本军国主义的阴谋，不仅不能引导日本民族走向复兴，而且注定是要失败的，并将首先毁灭日本自己。
    日本军国主义分子，不论过去、现在和将来，都是中国人民的敌人；但是日本人民，却始终是中国人民的朋友。日本人民在日本共产党的领导下，对于吉田反动政府协助美帝国主义复活日本军国主义、把日本拖上毁灭道路的政策，始终坚持了英勇的斗争。最近一年来，日本新形势的一个主要特点，就是日本人民争取独立、民主、和平运动的新的高涨。日本人民这一争取祖国独立、民主、和平的斗争，是完全符合于日本民族利益的。由于美帝国主义对日本的加紧控制，与日本国内军国主义的抬头，已迫使每一个日本公民不得不考虑民族前途的问题。今天摆在日本民族前面的，显然有两条截然不同的道路：或者团结国内一切爱国力量，驱逐外国占领者，打倒卖国的吉田政府，并与世界上一切爱好和平、民主的国家与人民，建立平等、友好、互利的关系，从而出现一个独立、民主、和平、繁荣的新日本；或者充当美帝国主义侵略亚洲的帮凶，重新与中国人民、亚洲人民、以及世界人民为敌，陷日本民族于毁灭的绝境。今天日本人民日益广大日益坚决地选择了前一条道路。日本人民这一斗争受着中国人民、全世界人民的热烈支持，因而是一定要胜利的。而选择后一条道路的日本军国主义分子，则注定是要失败的。
    中国人民一贯坚持和平政策。愿意与日本人民建立彼此尊重、互不侵犯、和平相处、平等友好、以及自主贸易、文化交流的关系。中国人民愿意与日本一切爱好和平的爱国人士，共同为保卫远东和平，反对日本军国主义复活而斗争。即将召开的亚洲及太平洋区域的和平会议，就将进一步团结亚洲、太平洋区域的人民，共同为制止侵略势力，保卫亚洲、太平洋区域的和平而奋斗。
