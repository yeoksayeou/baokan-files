　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 23rd: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a national crime investigation report on the 21st, admitting that crime incidents in the United States continue to increase significantly.

　　According to the report, there were 1,022,200 serious crimes committed in the United States in the first half of 1952. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover said that, based on this, serious crimes this year will exceed 2 million. Hoover said his estimate was conservative because the FBI only counted very serious crimes such as murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, and theft.

　　The frequency of crime incidents in the United States has reached an alarming level. The FBI admits that in the first half of this year, "on average, every two seconds, a theft occurs; every two minutes and twenty-seven seconds, a car theft occurs; every six minutes and thirteen and eight-tenths seconds, an aggravated assault occurs; and approximately every half hour, a rape occurs."

　　From the FBI's historical statistics, it can be seen that crime incidents in the United States are increasing year by year at an accelerating rate. In 1950, there were more than 1.79 million serious crimes; in 1951, serious crimes increased by more than 92,000 compared to 1950; and this year, there will be at least 162,000 more than in 1951. The age of criminals is also getting younger and younger. This year, the number of 18-year-old criminals is the highest, while in 1951, the most criminals were 23 years old. This situation shows the increasing moral decay of American society.

    美国犯罪案惊人增加
    【新华社二十三日讯】华盛顿消息：美国联邦调查局二十一日发表全国犯罪案件调查报告，承认美国犯罪事件继续大量增加。
    根据该项报告，一九五二年上半年在美国发生的严重罪案达一百零二万二千二百件。联邦调查局局长胡佛说：由此推算，今年严重的罪案将超过二百万件。胡佛表示他的估计是保守的，因为联邦调查局所统计的只是很严重的罪案，如谋杀、强奸、剧烈殴打、抢劫与盗窃案等。
    美国犯罪事件的频繁已达到惊人的程度，联邦调查局承认：在今年上半年，“平均每一天中间，每两秒钟发生一次窃盗案，每两分二十七秒发生一次偷汽车案，每六分十三秒八发生一次剧烈殴打案，每半小时左右发生一次强奸案”。
    从联邦调查局历年的统计中可以看出，美国犯罪事件一年比一年加速度地增加。一九五○年严重犯罪案共有一百七十九万多件，一九五一年严重犯罪案比一九五○年增加了九万二千多件，今年比一九五一年又至少要增加十六万二千多件。犯罪者年龄也越来越年轻，今年十八岁的罪犯人数最多，一九五一年犯罪最多的是二十三岁。这种情况表明了美国社会道德的日益堕落。
