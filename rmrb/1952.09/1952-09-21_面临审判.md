Facing Trial
Yuan Shuipai

The ironclad report has spread throughout the world,
    The pitiful rumor-mongering company is in a panic. [Note 1]
The Associated Press in San Francisco shouted "Strange" three times,
    But the Associated Press in Tokyo said it was "the same old trick,"
Not strange at all.
    May I ask, what is strange after all?
What is
    Rushing to the point of incoherence, with no way to cover it up!
The oaths sworn by the underlings are no longer enough,
    The august State Department has to come forward in person.
What you do is so inhumane, so unseemly,
    What you say is so high-sounding, so brazen:
"America stands innocent before the court of world opinion..." [Note 2]
    Indeed, there is at least a grain of truth in this sentence of yours,
You are indeed facing the judgment of world opinion today.
You, the United States government,
    And field mice carrying plague germs,
    And clams carrying cholera germs,
    And insects carrying anthrax germs,
    And houseflies, black flies, green flies, dung flies carrying typhoid germs…
Standing side by side
    Before the world's upright scientists, religious figures, and jurists,
Standing side by side
    Before all good people, including your own countrymen.
Angry eyes are watching you!
    Righteous fingers are pointing at you!
The confessions and accusations of your air force prisoners of war are ringing in the courtroom!
    The 450,000-word report – also a bill of indictment – is placed before you,
Scientific logic
    Is irrefutable,
Leaving no room for sophistry! Your "innocent body" is completely exposed,
    You cannot escape the judgment of all humanity!

[Note 1] In a dispatch from San Francisco on the 14th, the Associated Press used the words "strange" broadcast or news three times in reference to the broadcast by our Xinhua News Agency. In a dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th, the Associated Press used phrases such as "the same old trick" and "not surprising."
[Note 2] On September 15, the US State Department issued a statement in response to the publication of the report by the International Scientific Commission on the US bacteriological warfare, continuing to shamelessly deny its monstrous crimes. One sentence in the statement was: "America stands innocent before the court of world opinion..."

    面临审判
    袁水拍
    铁案如山的报告书传遍天下，
    可怜的造谣公司慌了手脚。〔注一〕
    旧金山美联社连喊了三声“奇怪”，
    东京美联社却说是“老一套”，
    并不奇怪。
    请问，到底奇怪不奇怪？
    到底是
    急得语无伦次，再也没法遮盖！
    小喽啰指天罚誓已经不够，
    堂堂国务院只好亲自出头。
    你做的是那样灭绝人性，见不得人面，
    你说的是那样冠冕堂皇，无耻厚颜：
    “美国以无罪之身兀立在世界舆论法庭之前……”〔注二〕
    不错，你这句话当中总算还有一点是真的，
    你今天的确面临世界舆论的审判。
    你，美国政府
    和带有鼠疫菌的田鼠，
    和带有霍乱菌的蛤蜊，
    和带有炭疽菌的昆虫，
    和带有伤寒菌的家蝇，黑蝇，绿蝇，粪蝇……
    一起并排站在
    世界正直的科学家，宗教家，法律家之前，
    一起并排站在
    所有善良的人民，连同你自己的国人之前。
    愤怒的眼睛看着你！
    正义的手指指着你！
    你的空军战俘的供词和对你的斥责响在法庭上！
    四十五万字的报告书——也是控诉状摆在你面前，
    科学的逻辑
    无可争辩，
    不容狡赖！你的“无罪之身”完全拆穿，
    你难逃全人类的审判！
    〔注一〕美联社旧金山十四日电讯中，对我国新华社的广播，连用“奇怪”的广播或消息等字样三次。美联社东京十五日电讯中，则有“老一套”，“并不惊奇”等语。
    〔注二〕九月十五日，美国国务院由于国际科学委员会关于美国细菌战的调查报告书的公布，发表了一项声明，对其滔天罪行继续作无耻狡赖。声明中有一句话是：“美国以无罪之身兀立在世界舆论法庭之前……”。
