Xinhua News Agency, September 26th:

A bumper harvest of all kinds of food crops has been achieved nationwide this year. According to preliminary estimates, the total grain output will exceed the highest production level before the War of Resistance Against Japan by nine percent. At present, early autumn crops such as early rice, mid-season rice, spring wheat, and millet have been harvested in various regions. Late autumn crops such as late rice, soybeans, sorghum, and corn are generally growing well and will be harvested successively soon. The best harvests this year are in the Northeast Region and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Northeast Region has the best harvest in more than a decade, with 85% to 90% of a normal year's yield throughout the region, and Jilin Province having a 100% yield. The situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is also different from previous years. The planting season for farmland in the region was generally 10 to 15 days earlier than last year, and coupled with favorable weather, the crops grew particularly well. Several banners in the Xing'an League have 100% yields, with an average grain yield of 2,000 catties per hectare. The region's autumn grain output may double compared to last year. The autumn harvest in the Southwest Region is nearing completion. Although the Southwest Region suffered continuous drought after spring planting, thanks to the active drought resistance efforts of the broad masses of farmers, the region's rice output still increased by 10% compared to last year, and miscellaneous grains also increased by 50%. In the Northwest Region, the spring wheat harvests in ethnic minority areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu provinces exceeded last year. Rice in rice-producing areas such as Wensu County on the southern slopes of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang and Ningxia can also increase by 10% to 20% compared to last year. The Northwest region's overall output of crops such as corn, millet, broomcorn millet, and highland barley can all increase by 5% compared to last year. In the Central South Region, which has the largest rice planting area in China, the early rice yield in Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces generally increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year; mid-season rice in Hunan Province also increased by 20% to 30% compared to last year; the region's overall grain output may increase by more than 10% compared to last year. The East China Region was hit by typhoons many times this year, and some areas also suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests, but the region's grain output can still increase by more than 10% compared to last year, exceeding this year's increase plan and breaking through the pre-war production level. Farmers in North China are currently busy with the autumn harvest, and the region's total output can increase by 25% to 30% compared to last year. Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shanxi provinces all have 80% yields; the harvests in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces greatly exceeded last year, especially Chahar Province, which had an unprecedented bumper harvest this year, exceeding the province's highest historical output by 40%.

During this year's autumn harvest across the country, many areas saw large-scale high-yield areas and high-yield land. According to preliminary investigations, the total area of land with large-scale high yields in Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China, this year will be nearly 600,000 mu; high-yield crops include soybeans, wheat, millet, sorghum, corn, etc., and their average yields all exceed the province's highest historical average yield by one to several times. In three townships in Huazhuang District, Wuxi City, southern Jiangsu, 200 rice-producing households with yields of over 1,000 catties per mu emerged; it is estimated that there will be thousands of rice-producing households in southern Jiangsu with yields of 1,000 catties. Large areas with yields of over 1,100 catties of rice per mu have also appeared in Anqing Prefecture, Anhui. This shows that China's grain output can still be greatly increased.

The reason for the widespread bumper harvest of food crops in China this year is that, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the broad masses of farmers have further organized themselves and launched a widespread and enthusiastic patriotic production increase campaign. Farmers in various regions have generally focused on increasing yield per unit area and strived to improve farming techniques. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in various regions has greatly developed in the first half of this year, and more than 35 million farmers have been organized nationwide. There are now more than 6 million mutual aid teams and more than 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, with 40% more farmers organized than last year. The patriotic production increase campaign launched by mutual aid teams and farmers around spring planting this year was also much larger in scale than last year. In North China alone, 180 state-owned farms, more than 1,700 agricultural production cooperatives, and nearly one million mutual aid teams led 1.5 million individual farmers to participate in the competition. The proposal to increase yield per unit area has also greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm to improve technology and increase yields. In the rice-producing areas of East China, Chen Yongkang's "small seedling close planting method" for high rice yields has been widely promoted, and deep plowing has been generally implemented, and the transplanting period has also been advanced by seven to more than ten days. During spring plowing and planting in the Central South Region, farmers in Jiangxi Province generally carried out three plowings and three harrows; last year, Hunan Province only promoted the planting of improved rice varieties in 18 counties, while this year there are 49 counties. Although many parts of the country suffered from disasters such as wind, insects, floods, and droughts this year, thanks to the active struggle of the people's governments at all levels leading the broad masses of farmers, they finally overcame natural disasters and achieved a bumper harvest of crops.

    全国粮食作物普遍丰收
    总产量可超过抗战前最高水平的百分之九
    【新华社二十六日讯】今年全国各种粮食作物普遍丰收。据初步估计，粮食总产量将超过我国抗战前最高生产水平的百分之九。目前各地的早稻、中稻、春麦和谷子等早秋作物已收割完毕；晚稻、大豆、高粱和玉米等晚秋作物一般都生长良好，不久将陆续收割。今年收成最好的是东北区和内蒙古自治区。东北区今年庄稼收成是十多年来最好的一年，全区有八成半到九成年景，吉林省是十成年景。内蒙古自治区的年景也是异乎往年。全区今年农田播种期一般比去年提早十天到十五天，再加上风调雨顺，庄稼就长得特别好。兴安盟的几个旗都有十成年景，平均每垧地产粮达二千斤，全区的秋粮可比去年增产一倍。西南区秋收已接近完成。虽然今年春播后西南区连续受旱，但由于广大农民积极开展了抗旱斗争，全区水稻仍比去年增产一成，杂粮也比去年增产百分之五十。西北区新疆、青海、甘肃等省少数民族地区的春麦，收成都超过去年。新疆天山南麓温宿县和宁夏等稻产区的水稻，也可比去年增产一成到两成。西北全区的玉米、谷子、糜子、青稞等作物都可比去年增产半成。我国种植水稻面积最广的中南区，今年广东、江西、湖南、广西四省的早稻产量，一般比去年增产一成到二成；湖南省中稻也比去年增产二成到三成；全区粮食产量可比去年增产一成以上。华东区今年遭台风多次侵袭，同时部分地区又受到了水、旱、虫等灾害，但全区粮食产量仍可比去年增产一成以上，超过了今年的增产计划，突破了抗战前生产水平。华北各地农民日前正忙着秋收，全区总产量可比去年增产二成半到三成。河北、平原、山西等省都有八成年景；察哈尔、绥远两省收成大大超过去年，尤其是察哈尔省今年空前大丰收，超过该省历年最高产量四成。
    今年全国各地秋收中，许多地区出现大面积丰产区、丰产地。据初步调查：东北黑龙江省今年大面积丰产的土地，总面积将近六十万亩；丰产作物包括大豆、小麦、谷子、高粱、苞米等，它们的平均产量都超过该省历史上最高平均产量的一倍到数倍。苏南无锡市华庄区三个乡，涌现了二百个每亩收千斤以上的水稻丰产户；估计苏南全区获得千斤产量的水稻丰产户将有数千户。安徽安庆专区也出现了每亩收稻一千数百斤的大片丰产区。这都说明了我国粮食产量还可以大大提高。
    今年我国粮食作物普遍丰收的原因，是广大农民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，进一步组织起来，广泛而热烈地开展了爱国增产竞赛运动。各地农民普遍以提高单位面积产量为中心，努力改进了耕作技术。今年上半年各地的互助合作运动有很大发展，全国组织起来的农民已达三千五百多万户。现在全国共有互助组六百多万个；有农业生产合作社四千多个，组织起来的农民比去年增加了百分之四十。各地的互助组与农民在今年春播前后开展起来的爱国增产竞赛运动，规模之大也远远超过了去年，仅华北区就有一百八十个国营农场、一千七百多个农业生产合作社和近百万个互助组带动了一百五十万户个体农民参加竞赛。提高单位面积产量方针的提出，也大大鼓舞了农民们改进技术、提高产量的热情。华东区的稻产区，广泛推广了水稻丰产模范陈永康的“小株密植法”，并普遍实行深耕，插秧期也提前了七天到十多天。中南区在春耕播种期间，江西省农民普遍做到三犁三耙；湖南省去年仅在十八个县内推广种植良种水稻，而今年已有四十九个县。今年全国不少地方虽然遭受了风、虫、水、旱等灾害的侵袭，但是由于各地人民政府领导广大农民积极斗争，终于战胜了自然灾害，使农作物得到丰收。
