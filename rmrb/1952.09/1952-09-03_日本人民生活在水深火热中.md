    The "impoverished state of the Japanese people today is unprecedented in Japanese history. War and defeat have bankrupted the nation. After the war, Japan became a slave of American imperialism, losing its freedom and independence, and losing basic human rights. ... Moreover, American imperialists not only bring us oppression and enslavement, they also exploit the Japanese people by using the occupation system and extracting profits from our country. To this end, they seize all rights to control and plan our industry, agriculture, commerce, and entire lives to suit their own interests." This is how the new program of the Japanese Communist Party points out the dire straits in which the Japanese people find themselves today. This situation shows that the Japanese people today have only one path to take, and only by ending the brutal rule of the US-Japan reactionaries in Japan can the Japanese people survive.
    For seven years, with the help of its Japanese running dogs, the American occupiers have controlled Japan's foreign trade, squeezed out Japan's national industry, seized large amounts of farmland as military bases, and forced the Japanese people to bear huge military expenses. Taking only the "occupation costs" extorted by the American occupiers every year as an example, by the end of last year, the accumulated amount in six years had reached 5 billion US dollars. Calculated on the basis of Japan's population of 84 million, each person had to bear more than 21,000 yen. All of this has pushed the Japanese people into an abyss of extreme hardship.
    In Japan, unemployed people are everywhere. To date, Japan has more than 18 million people who are completely unemployed or partially unemployed, accounting for 45 percent of Japan's national workforce. The living standards of the Japanese people have been greatly reduced. Even according to official reports, which are greatly reduced, the consumption level in Japanese cities last year was only 70 percent of that before the war.
    The Japanese working class is engaged in heavy and inhuman labor under the cruel exploitation of low wages. Soaring prices and heavy taxes leave little of the already meager wages. By the beginning of 1952, workers' actual wage income had been reduced to one-half of that before the war.
    However, workers receiving such meager wages are forced to work for 12 to 14 hours a day. In military factories, the oppression suffered by workers is even more severe, with five hours of overtime almost a daily occurrence, and this overtime is not compensated in any way. Not only that, during working hours, even smoking, going to the toilet, talking, or even wiping sweat are subject to interference, punishment, and even dismissal.
    Workers are not only struggling on the brink of starvation, but also struggling on the brink of death. Poor working conditions have led to a year-by-year increase in labor accidents and diseases among workers. According to the "Industrial Labor Monthly Report" published in the July 1951 issue, the number of Japanese workers injured at work in fiscal year 1949 was 576,204, and in 1950 it increased to 692,242; the number of people who died from injuries was an average of 10 per day in fiscal year 1949, and increased to 13 in fiscal year 1950. At the same time, the number of people who became disabled due to injuries also surged from an average of 89 per day in fiscal year 1949 to 141 per day in fiscal year 1950.
    The policies of the US-Japan reactionaries of levying exorbitant taxes and turning Japan into a military base have also caused great damage to Japanese rural areas. According to Japanese official statistics, Japan's total grain output in 1951 was the lowest in the post-war year, and the rice harvest was 4 million koku less than in 1950. However, the taxes borne by farmers have increased rather than decreased. The taxes they bear exceed one-third of their total production income. Many farmers are forced to sell their farm tools, livestock, and their own children in order to pay taxes. The Yoshida government also forced farmers to sell their grain at low prices. Therefore, there is a widespread shortage of rice in Japanese rural areas. Even Japanese official statistics have to admit that 42 percent of farmers nationwide are threatened by hunger. In fact, more than 60 percent of farmers are troubled by the problem of eating.
    Japanese women and children have also suffered the same tragic fate under the rule of the reactionaries. Japanese female students must work part-time to barely maintain their studies. Many female students have no choice but to work as hostesses, dancers, and models because they cannot find proper jobs, and even become "Jeep girls" exclusively for the entertainment of the US military. There are also many atrocities committed by the American occupation forces, which have brought great humiliation to the Japanese nation, and women have become prostitutes due to the pressure of life. In Tokyo alone, there are 300,000 prostitutes. The number of illegitimate children born to Japanese women raped by American soldiers has reached 200,800.
    Japanese children are in the midst of the suffering of dropping out of school, being child laborers, and committing crimes. Last year, nearly one million school-age children did not attend school. Hungry Japanese farmers have been forced to sell their own children for only 50 or 60 kilograms of rice. Many children have been sold to factories to work as child laborers. According to Japanese government statistics in 1947, including apprentices in shops and small workshops, there were about one million children working as child laborers in Japan. These child laborers receive very little wages in factories and are forced to engage in heavy labor like adults. In addition, due to the influence of decadent American culture, the number of crimes committed by Japanese children is also increasing. According to statistics from the Japanese National Police Agency: in 1950, a total of more than 158,000 crimes were committed by Japanese teenagers, of which children under the age of 14 accounted for one-third of the total. Theft accounts for the majority of crimes.
    Due to the above-mentioned severe suffering, incidents of suicide among the Japanese people are heard of every day. According to statistics from the Japanese National Police Agency: in 1950, a total of 21,702 people committed suicide, an average of 60 people per day. In Tokyo alone, an average of three people commit suicide every day.
    However, more Japanese people want to survive. They gradually realize the real reason that makes them live in dire straits, and rise up to carry out heroic struggles. Workers have continuously launched large-scale strikes, farmers are fighting against the requisition of land to build military bases, and women have also joined the ranks of collecting peace signatures. All this shows that the Japanese people not only want to survive, but also want peace, independence, and freedom. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 日本人民生活在水深火热中

    日本人民生活在水深火热中
    “日本国民现在所处的贫苦地位，是日本历史上从来没有过的。战争与失败使国民破产了。在战后，日本变成美帝国主义者的奴隶，丧失了自由和独立，丧失了基本的人权。……而且，美帝国主义者不仅带给我们以压迫和奴役，他们还利用占领制度剥削日本国民，从我国榨取利润。为此目的，他们夺取了一切控制和策划我们的工业、农业、商业和整个生活的权利，以便适合他们自己的利益。”这是日本共产党新纲领所指出的日本人民今天所处的水深火热的境况。这种境况，说明日本人民今天只有一条路可走，只有结束美日反动派在日本的残暴统治，日本人民才能生存下去。
    七年以来，美国占领者在其日本走狗的帮助之下，控制日本的对外贸易，挤垮了日本的民族工业，霸占了大量的农地充当军事基地，并且强迫日本人民负担巨额的军事费用。仅以美国占领者年年勒索的“占领费”为例，到去年年底为止，六年中累计已达五十亿美元，如以日本人口八千四百万来计算，平均每人要负担二万一千多日元。这一切，已经将日本人民推入极端困苦的深渊。
    在日本，失业者遍地皆是。到目前为止，日本已有一千八百万以上完全失业或部分失业的人，他们占日本全国有劳动能力人口的百分之四十五。日本人民的生活水平已经大为降低。即使根据官方大大缩小了的报告，去年日本城市的消费水平仅及战前的百分之七十。
    日本的工人阶级在低工资的残酷剥削下从事着繁重的和非人的劳动。飞腾的物价和繁重的捐税使原来已经很少的工资所余无几。到一九五二年初，工人的实际的工资收入已经降低到战前的二分之一。
    但是，领取着如此菲薄的工资的工人，却每天被迫从事十二到十四小时的紧张工作。在军需工厂中，工人们所受的压迫更为深重，每天五小时的额外工作，几乎是常事，这些额外的工作得不到任何的报酬。不仅如此，他们在工作时间内连抽烟、上厕所、说话，甚至擦汗都要遭到干涉、处分以至解雇。
    工人不仅挣扎在饥饿线上，也挣扎在死亡线上。恶劣的劳动条件使工人的劳动灾害和疾病率逐年增多。据一九五一年七月号的“产业劳动月报”刊载，一九四九年度日本工人因工作受伤的人数为五十七万六千二百零四人，一九五○年增加到六十九万二千二百四十二人；因受伤致死的人数一九四九年度是每天平均十人，到一九五○年度增加到十三人。同时，因受伤而变成残废的人数也由一九四九年度的平均每天八十九人激增到一九五○年度的每天一百四十一人。
    美、日反动派横征暴敛和使日本军事基地化的政策，使日本农村也遭到了极大的破坏。据日本官方的统计，一九五一年日本粮食的总产量为战后最低的一年，稻米的收获量比一九五○年减少了四百万日石。但是，农民所负担的赋税却有增无减。他们所负担的赋税，超过了他们生产总收入的三分之一。许多农民为了缴纳赋税，被迫出卖自己的农具、耕畜和亲生的儿女。吉田政府并以低价强迫征购农民的粮食。因此，日本农村中出现了普遍缺乏食米的现象。即使日本官方的统计，也不得不承认全国有百分之四十二的农民受到了饥饿的威胁。事实上，百分之六十以上的农民都为吃饭问题而感到苦恼。
    日本的妇女和儿童在反动派的统治下，也遭到了同样悲惨的命运。日本的女学生必须半工半读才能勉强维持学业。许多女学生由于找不到正当的职业只好充当女招待、舞女和模特儿，甚至做专供美军玩弄的“吉普女郎”。还有许多美国占领军的兽行，使日本民族蒙受了莫大的羞辱，妇女由于生活所迫沦为娼妓。仅东京一地，娼妓就有三十万人。被美军奸污的日本妇女所生的私生子竟达二十万零八千人。
    日本儿童处在失学、当童工以及犯罪的苦难中。去年已有将近一百万的学龄儿童没有上学。饥饿的日本农民为生活所迫，不得不出卖自己亲生的儿女，每个儿童仅售价五六十斤大米。有很多儿童被卖到工厂里去充当童工。根据日本政府一九四七年的统计，连商店、小作坊的学徒一并计算在内，全日本共有一百万左右的儿童充当童工。这种童工在工厂中工资很少，而且被迫与成人一样从事繁重的劳动。此外，由于美国堕落文化的影响，日本儿童犯罪的事件也在不断增多。据日本国家警察本部的统计：一九五○年日本少年儿童犯罪的共达十五万八千多人，其中十四岁以下的儿童占总数三分之一。犯罪的事件中以盗窃占最多数。
    由于以上各种深重的苦难，日本人民自杀的事件日有所闻。据日本国家警察本部统计：一九五○年共有二万一千七百零二人自杀，平均每日有六十人自杀。仅东京一地，平均每天就有三人自杀。
    但是，更多的日本人民是要求生存下去的。他们逐渐认识到使他们生活于水深火热中的真正原因，并且起来进行英勇的斗争。工人们不断展开了大规模的罢工运动，农民们则在进行反对征用土地修建军事基地的斗争，妇女们也参加了征集和平签名的行列。这一切都表明：日本人民不仅要求生存，并且要求和平、独立与自由。　（新华社）
