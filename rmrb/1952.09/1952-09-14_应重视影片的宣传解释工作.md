    Emphasis Should Be Placed on Publicity and Explanatory Work for Films
    Comrade Editor: Recently, the North China Management Office of the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation convened film projection units from some government organs and factories in Beijing to discuss film publicity work. Through this meeting, we learned that some projection units do not pay enough attention to film publicity work. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant had not done any film publicity work before; the Beijing Cultural Affairs Bureau's film projection team did not do enough publicity and explanatory work when showing the film "The Great Battle of Stalingrad" in the suburbs; and at the Beijing Power Supply Administration Bureau, due to insufficient publicity when showing translated films, there were more than 1,000 viewers at the beginning of the show, but only over 200 people remained later.
    The China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation headquarters has already published "Pay Attention to Publicity and Explanatory Work for Translated Films" (see page 3 of this newspaper on July 3), but some units have not paid enough attention to this work, and this should be corrected.
    Some units have already begun to pay attention to film publicity work. For example, the Shanghai State-Owned Cinema has been giving away leaflets with explanations along with tickets, and the public response has been very good. The Beijing Xinmin Evening News' New Film page also publishes publicity materials with larger coverage, which is very helpful to the publicity work of projection units. Projection units should think of more ways to do a good job in film publicity work. Each cinema can use slides, broadcasts, and other methods to carry out publicity, so that the audience can understand the films.

### 应重视影片的宣传解释工作

    应重视影片的宣传解释工作
    编辑同志：最近中国影片经理公司华北管理处曾召集了北京的一些机关、工厂的电影放映单位讨论电影宣传工作。通过这个会议我们晓得了一些放映单位对影片的宣传工作还不够重视。如石景山钢铁厂以前没做过影片宣传工作；北京文化事业管理局电影放映队在郊区放映影片“斯大林格勒大血战”时宣传解释工作做得不够；北京电业管理总局在放映翻译片时因宣传不够，开演时有一千多观众，到后来只有二百多人了。
    中国影片经理公司总公司已刊布“注意关于翻译片的宣传解释工作”（见七月三日本报第三版），可是有些单位还没有很好重视这个工作，这是应该改正的。
    有的单位已开始重视电影宣传工作了，如上海国营电影院已随票赠送说明书，群众反映很好。北京新民报新电影版也用较大篇幅刊登宣传资料，这对放映单位的宣传工作很有帮助。放映单位应多想办法做好影片的宣传工作，各影院可以用幻灯、广播等展开宣传，使观众看懂电影。
