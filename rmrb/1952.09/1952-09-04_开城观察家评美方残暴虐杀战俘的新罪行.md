    Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. A dispatch from Kaesong by London "Daily Worker" reporter Alan Winnington on the 2nd: Observers here point out: The US side is now openly adopting the old fascist and arbitrary so-called "suicide in prison" excuse to cover up their crimes of massacring prisoners of war. General Nam Il protested in a letter to the US chief negotiator on the 2nd against the new crimes of the US side in massacring one prisoner of war and harming sixteen prisoners of war. This is the sixth protest in six days. It is also pointed out here that the "suicide" of this prisoner of war on August 30th exposed the US side's repeatedly saying that if prisoners of war are repatriated home, they will threaten to commit suicide. The US side now contradicts itself by saying that the prisoners of war who want to go home and are now being detained and abused have really committed suicide.
    It is also pointed out here that the only effect of the arrival of British Deputy Chief of Staff Slessor is to continue the war to places near the Soviet border. Instead of preventing new provocative actions such as the bombing of the Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant, Slessor colluded with the United States to send planes to bomb places near the Soviet border. Therefore, the actual effect of sending Slessor is to drag Britain even deeper into the United States' crazy conspiracy to expand the Korean War.

    开城观察家评美方残暴虐杀战俘的新罪行
    【新华社三日讯】伦敦工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿二日自开城报道：此间观察家指出：美方现在已公然采取法西斯的武断的所谓“在狱内自杀”的老说法，来掩饰他们屠杀战俘的罪行。南日将军二日在致美方首席谈判代表的信中抗议美方屠杀战俘一人、残害战俘十六人的新罪行。这是在六天中的第六次抗议。此间并指出：这名战俘在八月三十日的“自杀”，揭穿了美方不断重复的所谓如果遣送战俘回家，战俘就威胁要自杀的说法。美方现在自相矛盾地说：想要回家而现在正被扣留和备受虐待的战俘真正自杀了。
    此间还指出，美方英籍副参谋长苏斯米斯到来的唯一效果，是把战争一直进行到苏联国境附近的地方。苏斯米斯不是阻止像轰炸鸭绿江水电厂这样的新的挑衅行为，而是与美国串通一起，派飞机轰炸苏联国境附近的地方。因此，派遣苏斯米斯的实际效果，是把英国比以前更深地拖进美国扩大朝鲜战争的疯狂阴谋中。
