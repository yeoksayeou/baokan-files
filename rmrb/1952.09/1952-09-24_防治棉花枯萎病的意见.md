Suggestions for Preventing and Controlling Cotton Wilt
Editor: This year, cotton wilt and Verticillium wilt have occurred in cotton-growing areas in Shaanxi, northern Sichuan, Shanxi, and the Northeast. In some places, the disease is very serious. In Gaomi and Pingnan cotton-growing areas in Shandong, the mortality rate of cotton plants has reached more than 80 percent in some cotton fields. The symptoms are yellowing of cotton leaves, soft and drooping edges, gradually turning blackish-brown; the cotton stalks gradually wither from top to bottom, with black stripes inside the stems. This disease has a great impact on cotton production. This bacterium can survive in the soil for many years, so it is not easy to control. Now I put forward a few suggestions for reference in various places: (1) In areas with severe disease, the export of cotton seeds should be strictly prohibited; diseased cotton fields should be marked, and people and animals should be prohibited from entering; farm tools should be disinfected after use; deep ditches should be dug around the diseased areas to prevent the spread of bacteria with water. Cotton fields with this bacterium are best rotated with other crops in the next three or four years to reduce the reproduction of the bacteria. (2) In areas with mild disease, diseased plants can be removed and buried in deep pits, covered with more than one foot of soil. In addition, seed purchasing organizations must understand the source of the seeds and must not mix cotton seeds with bacteria with seed cotton, or keep them as seeds.

    防治棉花枯萎病的意见
    编辑同志：今年陕西、川北、山西、东北等地棉区，发生了棉花枯萎病和黄萎病。个别地方病情很严重，山东高密、平南等棉区的部分棉田，棉株死亡率竟达百分之八十以上。病状是棉叶黄萎，边软下垂，逐渐变为黑褐色；棉茎由上而下逐渐枯死，茎内有黑色条纹。这种病害对棉花产量影响很大。这种病菌在土中能多年不死，所以不易防治。现在我提出几点意见，供各地参考：（一）病情严重地区，应严禁棉籽输出；发病棉田要插标记，禁止人畜进入；农具使用后最好消毒；病区四周要挖深沟，以免病菌随水传播。有这种病菌的棉地最好在最近三、四年内换种其他作物，以减少病菌的繁殖。（二）病情轻微地区，可拔除病株埋入深坑，覆土一尺以上。此外，收购种籽机构必须了解种籽来源，切勿把带有病菌的棉籽和种用棉籽混合，或留作种籽。  曾昭慧
