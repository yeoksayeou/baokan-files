Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 31st. TASS reported: The Korean Central News Agency, quoting a dispatch from Japan, stated that one thousand members of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" have been sent to the Korean front. The Korean Central News Agency said that these one thousand people were recruited into the "Police Reserve Force" in Gunma, Nagano, Chiba, and other prefectures in Japan. These people had all served in the "Police Reserve Force" barracks in Soumagahara, Gunma Prefecture. On July 20th, under the command of fifteen American officers, one hundred and fifty Rhee Syngman army sergeants, and ninety-nine American sergeants, they were sent to the Korean front. This unit, designated to be sent to the Korean front, had been receiving training in the use of American weapons since March of this year. These soldiers were taught how to use pistols and rocket launchers and drive tanks. Leaving the barracks and communicating with relatives and friends were strictly prohibited. Each soldier had an instructor—an American sergeant or officer. In order to interest the personnel of this unit in the Korean War, the Americans encouraged them to "do a good job," promising that each of them would receive 60,000 yen after two months, and that they would be free to demobilize freely after they returned to Japan from Korea. At the same time, the Americans threatened that anyone who attempted to escape would be shot.

    The fact that the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" was sent to the Korean front has been confirmed by a member of the force who broke through the American guard line and fled back to Soumagahara. The father of a "Police Reserve Force" soldier living in a village in Gunma Prefecture said that his son informed him that the "Police Reserve Force" had been transferred from Soumagahara to the Korean front.

    The news that the unit was sent to the Korean front has caused a wave of anger among the residents of Soumagahara and the families of the "Police Reserve Force" soldiers.

    More than 100,000 leaflets have been distributed among the residents, telling them that the "Police Reserve Force" has been sent from Soumagahara to the Korean front. Rallies have been held in many cities and villages to protest the dispatch of the "Police Reserve Force" to Korea.

    日本“警察后备队”一千人
    由美国军官率领赴朝鲜
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社平壤八月三十一日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社引述来自日本的一则消息说，有一千名日本“警察后备队”已被派赴朝鲜前线。朝鲜中央通讯社说，这一千人是在日本的群马、长野、千叶等县被招募到“警察后备队”的。这些人都曾在群马县相马原的“警察后备队”营房中服役。七月二十日，他们在十五名美国军官，一百五十名李承晚军队的军士和九十九名美国军士的统率下，被派赴朝鲜前线。这支被指定要派赴朝鲜前线的部队，从本年三月起就开始受使用美国武器的训练。这些士兵被教导如何使用手枪及火箭炮和驾驶坦克。离开营房以及与亲戚朋友们通消息，是被严格禁止的。每一个士兵有一个教官——一个美国军士或军官。为了要使这支部队的人员对朝鲜战争发生兴趣，美国人鼓励他们“好好地干”，答应他们在两个月以后每个人就可以拿到六万日元，并且在他们从朝鲜回到日本后就可以自由地复员。同时美国人又恫吓说，谁企图逃跑，就一定要遭枪毙。
    日本“警察后备队”被派赴朝鲜前线去的这个事实，已被该部队中一个突破了美国警卫线而逃回相马原的人所证实。住在群马县一个乡村中的一个“警察后备队”士兵的父亲说，他的儿子通知他，“警察后备队”已从相马原调到朝鲜前线去了。
    该部队被派赴朝鲜前线的消息，在相马原居民以及“警察后备队”士兵的家属中引起了愤怒的浪潮。
    有十万多张传单在居民中间散发，告诉他们“警察后备队”已从相马原被派赴朝鲜前线去了。许多城市和乡村中都举行了集会，抗议派遣“警察后备队”到朝鲜去。
