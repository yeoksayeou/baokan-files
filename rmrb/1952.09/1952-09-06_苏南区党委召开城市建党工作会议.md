    The CPC Sunan District Committee Convenes Urban Party Building Work Conference

    Editor's Note: The method of the CPC Sunan District Committee Organization Department in promptly convening an urban party building work conference to solve specific problems in party building work is very good. The opinions and methods put forward at the meeting are also correct and can be used as a reference for party committees in various localities.

    The Organization Department of the CPC Sunan District Committee convened a party building work conference in the five cities of Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, and Changshu in June, focusing on the issue of party building among industrial workers.

    Before the "Three-Anti" Movement, the five cities of Wuxi and others had already trained a group of industrial worker activists. After training, the class consciousness of these activists has been significantly improved, and most of them have requested to join the Party. For example, in the activist training class run by the Wuxi Municipal Party Committee, more than 90 percent of the students applied to join the Party. This proves that holding activist training classes is a very good way to carry out party building work. Therefore, the Sunan District Committee decided at this meeting that before March of next year, the five cities of Wuxi and others should systematically educate activists on communism and the Communist Party, the eight conditions for Communist Party members, etc., through Party schools, district and factory Party training classes or political training classes, in order to raise their class consciousness. The Municipal Party School should target activists who basically meet the conditions for joining the Party, allowing them to leave production and concentrate on training. The Municipal Party Schools of each city should generally run seven or eight sessions, with 300 to 500 people trained in each session, and each session lasting for three weeks to a month. The district and factory Party training classes should target general worker activists, adopting the method of attending classes in their spare time, with each session lasting approximately six weeks. It is expected that four to five sessions can be run, with the number of people trained in each session determined based on conditions.

    In order to successfully complete this training task, the meeting suggested that the Municipal Party Committees should earnestly strengthen the work of the Party Schools, requiring that each Municipal Party School be equipped with a full-time deputy principal and two to three Party class teachers, and that the district and factory Party training classes should also have designated full-time Party class teachers. Teachers should be selected from the full-time cadres of the Municipal Party Committee, District Committee, and factories.

    The activists participating in the training must be registered and reviewed, and the Party organization should be responsible for soliciting opinions from the masses regarding these activists. After systematically educating and observing the activists, those who meet the standards of Party members can be admitted to the Party in large numbers. Generally, it is required that one-third to two-thirds of the students in the Municipal Party School be admitted to the Party, and the district and factory Party training classes can appropriately admit members. The meeting believes that this approach is both convenient for the leadership to grasp the party building work among industrial workers and can solve the difficulty of insufficient party building strength, and should be earnestly implemented.

    Regarding the issue of organizing party building work forces, the meeting proposed that each unit should be equipped with fixed and temporary organizers. The organizers should go to the factories to carry out party building work in conjunction with production and other movements. Factories with 500 to 1,000 workers should have one fixed organizer, those with 1,000 to 2,000 workers should have two, those with 2,000 to 3,000 workers should have three, and those with 3,000 to 4,000 workers should have four. One-third to two-thirds of the cadres of the Party Committee Organization Department should serve as fixed organizers, and Party member cadres in trade unions and other people's organizations who meet the conditions of organizers should become temporary Party organizers. In addition, the District Committee should organize a party building work team, and after conducting short-term training for the team members, they can be assigned to various cities with a focus on carrying out party building pilot work and inspecting general party building work.

    Finally, the meeting believes that the key to whether party building work can be done well lies in leadership. Therefore, during the preparation period for party building, the leadership should formulate detailed plans and organize party building work forces. After the party building work begins, special attention should be paid to "adhering to standards, strictly following procedures, timely inspection, and summarizing experience."

### 苏南区党委召开城市建党工作会议

    苏南区党委召开城市建党工作会议
    编者按：中共苏南区党委组织部及时召开城市建党工作会议，解决建党工作中的具体问题的方法，是很好的。在会议上所提出的意见和办法也是正确的，可供各地党委参考。
    中共苏南区党委组织部曾于六月间召开无锡、苏州、镇江、常州、常熟五个市的建党工作会议，着重研究了在产业工人中进行建党的问题。
    “三反”运动前，无锡等五个城市已训练了一批产业工人积极分子。这些积极分子经过训练后，阶级觉悟有显著提高，其中绝大部分人都要求入党。例如在无锡市委办的积极分子训练班中，就有百分之九十以上的学员提出入党要求。这证明举办积极分子训练班是进行建党工作的一种很好的方式。因此，苏南区党委在这个会议上决定：在明年三月以前；无锡等五个城市要通过党校、区和工厂的党员训练班或政治训练班，对积极分子进行系统的关于共产主义和共产党、共产党员标准的八项条件等的教育，以提高他们的阶级觉悟。市委党校以基本上具备入党条件的积极分子为对象，使他们脱离生产，集中进行训练。各市委的党校大体上要开办七期或八期，每期训练三百至五百人，每期的训练时间为三个星期至一个月。区及工厂的党训班，以一般工人积极分子为对象，采取业余时间上课的办法，每期的训练时间大体上为六个星期，预计可开办四至五期，每期训练的人数视条件而定。
    为了顺利地完成这一训练任务，会议建议各市委应切实加强党校的工作，要求给市委党校配备一个专职副校长和二至三个党课教员，区和工厂的党训班也要有指定的专职的党课教员。教员要在市委、区委和工厂的在职干部中选择。
    参加受训的积极分子，必须经过登记、审查，党的组织并应负责向群众征求对这些积极分子的意见。在对积极分子进行了系统的教育和考察后，即可大量地接收其中合乎党员标准的人入党。一般要求在市委党校的学员中接收三分之一至三分之二的人入党，区和工厂的党训班可适当接收。会议认为，这种做法既便于领导方面掌握在产业工人中的建党工作，又可以解决建党力量不足的困难，应该认真实行。
    关于组织建党工作的力量问题。会议提出：各单位要配备固定的和临时的组织员。由组织员到工厂中结合生产等运动进行建党工作。凡有五百至一千工人的工厂设固定组织员一人，有一千至二千工人的设二人，有二千至三千工人的设三人，有三千至四千工人的设四人。党委组织部应有三分之一至三分之二的干部担任固定的组织员，工会等人民团体中的党员干部，凡具备组织员条件者，均应成为党的临时组织员。另外，区党委要组织一个建党工作队，在对队员进行短期训练后，可以有重点地分配他们到各市进行建党试点工作，并检查一般建党工作。
    最后，会议认为：建党工作能否做好的关键在于领导。因此，在建党的准备期间，领导方面应制订周密计划，组织建党工作力量。在建党工作开始后，应特别注意“坚持标准，严格手续，及时检查，总结经验”。
