    Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: Venerable Yuan Ying, who served as the Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association before the Anti-Japanese War, recently wrote a letter to Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, and Vice-Chairmen Peng Zhen and Chen Shutong, expressing support for the Asian and Pacific Rim Peace Conference to be held in Beijing. The letter stated: The Asian and Pacific Rim Peace Conference, for the well-being of mankind, is a great movement for safeguarding world peace. The compassionate teachings of Buddhism are peace-loving, especially the Mahayana Buddhist spirit of selflessness and altruism, which strives for peace and saves peace, taking the interests of all beings as its own. Therefore, we believe that the convening of this peace conference, in its spirit and importance, not only conforms to the wishes of the people of the world for peace, but also conforms to our Buddhist teachings, and we Buddhists sincerely support it.
