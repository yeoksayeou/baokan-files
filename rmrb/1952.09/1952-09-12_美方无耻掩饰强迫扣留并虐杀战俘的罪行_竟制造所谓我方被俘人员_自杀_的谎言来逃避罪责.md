Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, September 11th:

    Harrison stubbornly insists that our captured personnel would "commit suicide" if repatriated, but our captured personnel are constantly "committing suicide" in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. According to a Reuters report on the 10th, U.S. military authorities announced that on the 9th of this month, a soldier of the People's Army "hanged himself" in a prisoner-of-war camp on Koje Island. This so-called "suicide" is clearly the result of the U.S. side using various tortures to persecute prisoners of war, forcing them to abandon their right to repatriation. In order to cover up their crimes, the U.S. side describes this incident as the "first rare occurrence" in the prisoner-of-war camp. However, just eight days earlier, on the 2nd of this month, U.S. military authorities also announced that on the 30th of last month, a prisoner of war "hanged himself" in the same prisoner-of-war camp on Koje Island.
    In fact, the number of prisoners of war forced to their deaths by the U.S. side is far more than these "rare" two instances. Many prisoners of war who were forced to act as special agents and airdropped into our areas have already reported to us that in order to detain a large number of our captured personnel, the U.S. side arbitrarily persecutes them, and as a result, many prisoners of war have committed suicide because they cannot bear this abuse. In addition, some prisoners of war were actually killed by the U.S. side, but U.S. military authorities lied and said that the prisoners of war "committed suicide" in order to evade responsibility. In January of this year, in the 86th Regiment of the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, a prisoner of war refused to get a tattoo and put a blood fingerprint on a "petition" for "voluntary repatriation," and was severely injured by Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents. In the end, he hanged himself because he could not bear the continued abuse of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' special agents. Another prisoner of war in the regiment also refused to get a tattoo and write a blood letter, and after being subjected to torture, hard labor, and reduced food rations, he could not bear the suffering and finally swallowed a razor blade and died.
    The U.S. side claims that it is "continuing to investigate" this latest incident of murdering prisoners of war, just like many previous inconclusive incidents. However, regardless of whether the U.S. side's "investigation" has any fabricated conclusions to cover up their crimes and evade responsibility, all the terrifying and tyrannical crimes behind the so-called prisoner of war "suicides" have long been recognized by the people of the world. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for these crimes.

### 美方无耻掩饰强迫扣留并虐杀战俘的罪行  竟制造所谓我方被俘人员“自杀”的谎言来逃避罪责

    美方无耻掩饰强迫扣留并虐杀战俘的罪行
    竟制造所谓我方被俘人员“自杀”的谎言来逃避罪责
    【新华社开城十一日电】哈利逊硬说我方被俘人员如果被遣返就要“自杀”，但是我方被俘人员却在美方战俘营中不断“自杀”。据路透社十日电称：美军当局宣布本月九日在巨济岛战俘营中，有一名人民军战俘“自缢身死”。这种所谓“自杀”，显然是美方用各种酷刑迫害战俘，强迫他们放弃遣返权利的结果。美方为了掩饰自己的罪行，把这个事件说成是战俘营中“第一次稀有的情形”。但是，就在八天以前，即本月二日，美军当局也曾宣布：上月三十日，同样是在巨济岛战俘营中，有一名战俘“自缢身死”。
    其实，美方逼死战俘，岂止这“稀有的”两次。许多名被迫充当特务而空降到我方地区的战俘，早已向我方报告说：美方为了扣留大批我方被俘人员，恣意迫害他们，因此不少战俘因为受不了这种虐待而自杀。另外有些战俘实际上是被美方杀死的，但美军当局为了逃避罪责，却撒谎说是战俘“自杀”。今年一月间，巨济岛战俘营第八十六联队有一个战俘，因拒绝刺字和在“自愿遣返”的“请愿书”上盖血印，就被蒋匪特务打得负重伤，最后他因为受不了蒋匪特务的继续虐待而自缢身死。该联队另外一个战俘也因拒绝刺字和写血书，被毒刑拷打后又遭受罚苦工和减少食粮等折磨，不堪其苦，终于吞食保险刀片而死。
    美方对最近这次虐杀战俘事件，像对从前的许多次毫无下文的事件一样，声称“正在继续调查”。但是，不管美方的“调查”有无他们编造出来掩盖罪行、推卸责任的下文，美方在所谓战俘“自杀”后面的一切恐怖与暴虐的罪行，已经是早已为全世界人民所共认。美方必须对这些罪行负完全的责任。
