    The "Trick Courtyard" of a Factory in Shenyang
    By our reporter Gu Weijin
    The "Trick Courtyard" of a certain factory in Shenyang is a school where technical personnel and workers combine to study and promote advanced experience in an organized and led manner. Its emergence was as follows: After advanced producers in various workshops conducted typical demonstrations, educated workers to criticize conservative thinking, and established advanced thinking, some workshops had already begun to see examples of finding tricks. In order to mobilize the masses to find tricks and promote advanced experience on a large scale, and to promptly solve a series of problems such as review, processing, research, summarization, synthesis, appraisal, promotion, and reward after the masses found tricks, the grass-roots trade union led workers and technical personnel to conduct research, and the Trick Courtyard was born. The organization of the Trick Courtyard takes the workshop as a unit, and the participants include advanced production figures, technical personnel, veteran skilled workers, and members of the workshop trade union production committee and rationalization proposal committee, totaling eleven to fifteen people. They are all democratically elected. Advanced production figures serve as the dean, technical personnel serve as the vice-dean or consultant, and there are two groups: "Mobilization and Promotion Group" and "Technical Research Group." The Mobilization and Promotion Group consists of three to five people, including advanced production figures, veteran skilled workers, and members of the workshop rationalization proposal committee. Their tasks are: 1. To mobilize workers to find tricks and make rationalization proposals in a planned manner; 2. To mobilize workers to seize research topics and organize workers to discuss ways to realize the topics based on the topics proposed by the Technical Research Group; 3. To vigorously promote advanced experience and commend advanced figures in a timely manner. The Technical Research Group consists of five to seven people, including technical personnel, advanced production figures, veteran skilled workers, and members of the workshop trade union production committee. Their tasks are: 1. To register, classify, review, and approve tricks and rationalization proposals. 2. To organize trick experiments, make technical appraisals after successful experiments, calculate the value of the tricks, and propose reward recommendations; to formulate a regular plan for technical improvements. 3. To discover key problems in the production of each group, propose research topics; to synthesize advanced experience, compile technical teaching materials, conduct technical education, and improve the technical level of workers.
    In the month since its establishment, the Trick Courtyard has played a significant role in mobilizing the masses to find tricks and promote advanced experience.
    I have visited several workshop Trick Courtyards. Here, inside and out, are posted many vivid slogans, such as: "Tricks enter the courtyard to win the red flag, report good news to Chairman Gao Gang"; "Technical personnel have high theory, workers have good experience, the combination of the two, tricks come out"; "Don't be afraid of small tricks, just be afraid of few tricks, many tricks gathered together, its value is higher than the mountain." This is the creation of the Mobilization and Promotion Group. The members of this group often go deep into various groups to understand the workers' ideological situation and propose slogans for propaganda and encouragement. The person in charge of the Second Workshop Trick Courtyard told me two vivid facts: The two group leaders of the day and night shifts of the Eighth Group often had disunity, which affected the whole group in finding tricks. The comrades of the Mobilization and Promotion Group posted a slogan next to their machines: "Old Cao and Old Sun (the surnames of the two group leaders), look, what to do with increasing production and practicing economy? Unite as one, increase production and practice economy by hundreds of thousands (tons)." Old Sun saw it and anxiously found Old Cao and said: "Look, it's not right for us to be disunited any longer." Old Cao also anxiously said: "Let's guarantee not to quarrel anymore, study and improve technology well, and do a good job in increasing production and practicing economy." Three days later, they jointly researched and developed three tricks to improve technology. Wang Chunyang and Zhang Rong of the Ninth Group once created a trick to improve the machine, saving one worker per machine, but the product quality was not good, and there were many defective products. The comrades of the Mobilization and Promotion Group sent them another slogan: "Old Wang and Old Zhang have extensive experience, improving technology reduces costs, your group still has bad products, you two use your brains again." After Wang Chunyang read it, he said to Zhang Rong: "We really have to use our brains again to think about improving it." After several days of painstaking research, the two finally came up with a new trick to improve the tool, reducing the number of defective products in the whole group by 50%.
    In the past, the tricks found and the rationalization proposals made by the workers often could not be dealt with in a timely manner; now the Trick Courtyard has set a system, stipulating that the tricks and rationalization proposals made by the workers should generally be dealt with properly within two days, and the complicated ones should also be dealt with properly within one week. This is a great encouragement for the workers to find tricks. The young worker Wang Xianzhang said: "I found a trick to speed up the machine, and the Trick Courtyard registered and reviewed it, and replied that it could be used in less than two days, so I concentrated on finding other tricks. Now I have found a trick to save belts." The Trick Courtyard also stipulated a system to reward according to the value of the tricks, which also encouraged the workers to find tricks.
    In the process of mobilizing the masses to find tricks, the Trick Courtyard often sends people from the Technical Research Group to go deep into various groups to assist the workers in solving technical problems. The workers of the Second Workshop wanted to transform a machine, and the transformation could double the output and improve the quality. They came up with many ways to transform the machine; however, these methods lacked theoretical calculations and designs. After the technical personnel analyzed, studied, improved, and designed these methods from a technical theory perspective, the machine was successfully transformed. The workers felt that they had improved their technical and theoretical level, and the technical personnel also felt that they had a way to work. The technical personnel said: "If we were alone, we wouldn't have thought of so many ways at the beginning, we would have to slowly design and draw, and constantly revise the drawings; the workers have rich practical experience and quickly come up with ways. This gives us the convenience of analyzing, researching, and designing in technical theory." In the past, although some workers created complete tricks, it was difficult to promote them because they could not be raised to the level of technical theory. For example, Zhang Xihe of the Ninth Group created a trick to improve quality, the quality was improved to 99.995%, and the output exceeded the quota by 31 kilograms. Most people think that the essence of Zhang Xihe's trick is "three diligence" (diligent hands, diligent eyes, and diligent sampling). The trade union called on the workers to operate according to the "three diligence," but the results were not great, and they were sweating profusely but could not reach Zhang Xihe's quality and quantity. Later, the technical personnel analyzed and studied Zhang Xihe's operating experience from a technical theory perspective and concluded that: the "three diligence" of simply increasing labor intensity is not the essence of Zhang Xihe's trick, the essence of his trick is "grasping more," "less dumping," and "diligent sampling" and other five characteristics, and at the same time explaining the many scientific reasons why these characteristics occur. The workers operated according to these five characteristics, and as a result, the product quality was improved, and the body was not tired. Zhang Xihe's trick was quickly promoted.
    The combination of technical personnel and workers not only improves the technical and theoretical knowledge of workers, but also enriches the technical theory of technical personnel. Yang Rubin, head of the technical management section and deputy director of the Trick Courtyard, talked about his experience: "In the past, we didn't get close to the workers, and we formulated operating procedures based on our own theory, but the result was often not feasible when we took it to the workers. Now we have moved the office to the Trick Courtyard, and we are with the workers all day long, watching them operate, and studying with them, which has proved, enriched, and improved the theories we have learned in the past, and criticized the conservative thinking and the practice of rigidly copying dogmas, which is equivalent to going to college for several years."
    The combination of technical personnel and workers has universally mobilized the enthusiasm of workers to find tricks. Even tricks with little certainty are taken to the Trick Courtyard to study with technical personnel. Therefore, the Trick Courtyard receives more and more tricks: in the first week of its establishment, it received a total of 667 tricks, and now it has received 1,696 tricks in more than a month. Most of these tricks are inventions, creations, improvements of machines, tools, and improvements of operating methods. According to the statistics of only a part of the tricks that have been realized, it can create a wealth of 27,077 tons of grain for the country. The original plan of the whole factory to increase production and practice economy by 40,000 tons of grain has now been changed to 52,000 tons.
    Now the Trick Courtyard is summarizing many tricks and rationalization proposals into advanced experience, so as to formulate new operating procedures. This is an important work of concentrating mass wisdom to guide mass action. In order to do this work well, the Trick Courtyard has compiled the summarized advanced experience into teaching materials, organized technical personnel to explain to workers; organized advanced producers to conduct practical performances and impart knowledge; organized workers to establish technical research mutual aid groups and formulated plans for learning advanced experience. This is decisive for workers to master advanced experience from a technical theory perspective, for the implementation of new operating procedures, and for the promotion of advanced experience.

    沈阳某工厂的“窍门大院”
    本报记者　古维进
    沈阳某工厂的“窍门大院”，是技术人员与工人结合起来有组织有领导地学习和推广先进经验的学校。它的产生经过是这样：当各车间的先进生产者进行典型示范、教育工人批判保守思想、树立先进思想后，有的车间已经开始出现了找窍门的例子。为了普遍地大量地发动群众找窍门与推广先进经验，并及时解决群众找出窍门后的审查、处理、研究、总结、综合、鉴定、推广、奖励等一系列的问题，基层工会即领导工人与技术人员进行研究，产生了窍门大院。窍门大院的组织以车间为单位，参加的人有先进生产人物、技术人员、老技术工人、车间工会生产委员会及合理化建议委员会委员等十一人至十五人。他们都是经过民主选举的。先进生产人物担任院长，技术人员担任副院长或顾问，下设“发动推广组”与“技术研究组”。发动推广组由先进生产人物、老技术工人、车间合理化建议委员会等三人至五人组成，任务是：一、有计划地发动工人找窍门，提合理化建议；二、根据技术研究组提出的课题，发动工人抢课题，组织工人讨论实现课题的办法；三、大力推广先进经验，及时表扬先进人物。技术研究组由技术人员、先进生产人物、老技术工人及车间工会生产委员会委员等五人至七人组成，任务是：一、把窍门和合理化建议加以登记分类，审查批准。二、组织窍门试验，试验成功后作出技术鉴定，计算窍门的价值，提出奖励的意见；制订技术改进的定期计划。三、发现各小组生产中的关键问题，提出课题；综合先进经验，编出技术教材，进行技术教育，提高工人技术水平。
    窍门大院成立一个多月以来，在发动群众找窍门与推广先进经验上起了很大作用。
    我参观过好几个车间的窍门大院。这里，里里外外贴着许多生动的标语，如：“窍门进院夺红旗，向高岗主席去报喜”；“技术人员理论高，工人经验好，两下一结合，窍门出来了”；“不怕窍门小，就怕窍门少，许多窍门集中起，它的价值比山高”。这是发动推广组的创作。这个组的成员经常深入各个小组，了解工人的思想情况，提出宣传鼓动的口号。二车间窍门大院负责人告诉我两件生动的事实：八道小组日夜班的两个小组长经常闹不团结，影响全组找窍门。发动推广组的同志就拟了一条标语贴在他们的机器旁边：“老曹老孙（二个组长的姓）你俩看，增产节约怎么办？团结一条心，增产节约几十万（吨）”。老孙看见了，着急地找到老曹说：“你看，咱们再不团结可不对了。”老曹也着急地说：“咱俩保证再不闹蹩扭，好好研究改进技术，把增产节约搞好。”过了三天，他们就共同研究出三项改进技术的窍门。九道小组的汪纯阳和张荣，曾经创造了改进机器的窍门，使每台机器节省一个工，但产品质量不好，有许多次品。发动推广组的同志又拟了标语送给他们：“老汪老张经验广，改进技术成本降，你组还有不好品，你俩再用脑筋想。”汪纯阳看了之后对张荣说：“咱们真得再用脑子想法改进才行。”二人经过几天苦心研究，终于想出新窍门，改进了工具，使全组的次品减少了百分之五十。
    过去工人们找出的窍门和提出的合理化建议经常得不到及时处理；现在窍门大院定出制度，规定工人提的窍门和合理化建议一般要在两天内处理妥当，复杂的也不超过一礼拜就要处理妥当。这对于工人们找窍门是一个很大的鼓舞。青年工人王宪章说：“我找到加快机器转数的窍门，窍门大院一登记就审查，不到两天就答复能用，我就集中精力再找别的窍门。现在我又找到节省皮带的窍门了。”窍门大院还订出制度，按窍门价值的大小分别奖励，这也鼓舞了工人找窍门。
    窍门大院在发动群众找窍门当中，经常派出技术研究组的人深入各个小组，协助工人解决技术上的问题。二车间的工人要改造一部机器，改造出来可以提高产量一倍，质量也能提高，他们想出了改造机器的许多办法；但这些办法缺乏理论上的计算和设计，技术人员从技术理论上把这些办法加以分析、研究、提高及设计后，这部机器就改造成功了。工人感到提高了技术理论水平，技术人员也觉得工作有了办法。技术人员们说：“光有我们，开头就想不出那许多办法，还得慢慢设计绘图，还得不断修改图样；工人有丰富的实际操作经验，很快就想出办法来了。这样就给了我们在技术理论上进行分析、研究、设计的方便。”过去，有些工人虽然创造了完整的窍门，但因不能提高到技术理论上来，所以很难推广。例如九道小组张喜贺创造了提高质量的窍门，质量提高到百分之九九点九九五，产量超过定额三十一公斤。一般人都认为张喜贺的窍门实质是“三勤”（手勤、眼勤、抽验勤）。工会号召工人照着“三勤”去操作，结果收效不大，累得满头大汗也达不到张喜贺的质量和数量。后来技术人员从技术理论上把张喜贺的操作经验作了分析研究，得出结论说：单纯提高劳动强度的“三勤”，不是张喜贺的窍门的实质，他的窍门的实质是“抓得多”、“倒货少”、“抽验勤”等五个特点，同时说明为什么产生这些特点的许多科学道理。工人们依据这五个特点进行操作，结果提高产品质量，身体也不累。张喜贺的窍门很快被推广出去了。
    技术人员与工人结合，不仅提高工人的技术理论知识，也丰富了技术人员的技术理论。技术管理股长兼窍门大院副院长杨汝滨谈到他的体会时说：“从前我们和工人不大接近，凭着自己的理论拟订操作规程，结果拿到工人里去时常行不通。现在把办公的地方搬到窍门大院，整天和工人在一起，看他们操作，和他们共同研究，结果使我们过去学习的理论得到了证明、充实、提高，批判了保守思想与硬搬教条的作风，等于上了几年大学。”
    技术人员与工人的结合，普遍发挥了工人找窍门的积极性。连把握不大的窍门，也都拿到窍门大院和技术人员研究，因此窍门大院收到的窍门越来越多：该院成立的第一周共收到窍门六百六十七件，现在一个多月来已收到一千六百九十六件。这些窍门多半是发明创造、改进机器、工具、改进操作方法的。仅据已经实现的一部分窍门统计，就可以给国家创造二万七千零七百七十吨粮食的财富。全厂原计划增产节约四万吨粮食的指标，现已改为五万二千吨。
    现在窍门大院正在把许多窍门和合理化建议总结成为先进经验，以便订出新的操作规程。这是集中群众智慧指导群众行动的一项重要工作。为了做好这一工作，窍门大院已把总结出来的先进经验编成了教材，组织技术人员向工人讲解；组织先进生产者进行实际表演和传授；组织工人成立技术研究互助组和订出学习先进经验的计划。这对于工人从技术理论上去掌握先进经验、对于新的操作规程的实行和先进经验的推广，是有决定作用的。
