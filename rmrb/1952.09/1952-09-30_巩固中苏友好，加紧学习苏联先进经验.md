    Consolidate Sino-Soviet Friendship, Intensify the Study of Advanced Soviet Experience
    Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association
    The friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is the most reliable guarantee for peace in the Far East and the world. Chairman Mao taught us: "The powerful alliance between China and the Soviet Union is an invincible force, a strong guarantee against imperialist aggression and for safeguarding peace and security in the Far East, and also a guarantee for the victory of the great cause of striving for world peace." The facts of the past three years have fully confirmed Chairman Mao's brilliant thesis. The imperialists' aggressive conspiracies have been continuously and severely hit by the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union. The world peace and democratic forces, based on the Sino-Soviet alliance, are developing and growing vigorously, and have far surpassed the strength of the imperialist aggressive camp. The recent Sino-Soviet communiqué on the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the Government of the People's Republic of China and the exchange of notes on extending the period of joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base are extremely important measures to ensure peace in the Far East and the world. It greatly encouraged the peace-loving people of the world; at the same time, it severely struck a head-on blow to the evil conspiracy of US imperialism colluding with Japanese militarist forces.
    The friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is an important guarantee for the success of the new China's construction.
    For three years, in accordance with the Sino-Soviet loan and trade agreements, the Soviet government has provided our country with a large amount of material assistance, providing important material and technical conditions for our economic recovery, especially for our industrialization. Under the kind concern and guidance of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet government also sent a large number of outstanding experts to our country, who, with a great spirit of internationalism, worked with the Chinese working people and sincerely and selflessly helped the construction of the new China. They unreservedly handed over the advanced Soviet science, technology, and production experience to the Chinese people, cultivated a large number of construction talents for the new China, saved and increased a large amount of wealth, and greatly shortened the process of construction in various aspects of the new China.
    Let's take an example. In the industrial field, the promotion of the advanced Soviet experience of the "rapid repair method" in the Northeast has enabled the power industry system in the area to create wealth worth more than 8,000 tons of grain for the country. Soviet experts have passed on the Soviet machine industry's high-speed cutting method to our workers, which has increased the efficiency of machine tools several times to dozens of times. The Soviet advanced production experience of "parallel operation method" has greatly shortened the construction time of mine shafts in our country. The Northeast Xi'an Mining Bureau, because of the promotion of this advanced experience, can complete large-scale shaft projects five years ahead of schedule. The promotion of the Soviet advanced experience of the "Kovalev work method" in many production departments in our country has played a great role in improving industrial productivity in our country. The application of the Soviet advanced experience of "organizing rhythmic production according to instruction charts" in our country has brought about a major reform in our enterprise management methods.
    The rapid development of the new China's railway industry in the past three years has been inseparable from the help of Soviet experts. What is particularly worth mentioning is the brilliant achievements of the Chinese Changchun Railway. For more than two years, Soviet experts of the Chinese Changchun Railway have trained more than 16,300 employees who can master advanced methods of enterprise management for us; as of the end of 1951, more than 130 kinds of advanced Soviet railway work methods had been promoted. Thanks to the Chinese railway employees' learning of advanced Soviet experience and the joint efforts of Chinese and Soviet railway employees, in 1951, the labor productivity of the Chinese Changchun Railway increased by 27.8 percent compared with 1950, and the expenditure saved more than 72.3 billion yuan from the original plan. The profit obtained due to the accelerated turnover of vehicles exceeded the planned one trillion yuan. Another example is the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway ahead of schedule, which was opened to traffic on July 1 this year. In just two years, it has realized the hope of the people of Sichuan for more than 40 years, and it is a brilliant example of the combination of the creative genius of the Chinese working people and the experience of Soviet socialist construction. In the construction process of this project, advanced Soviet experience was widely used from the construction of roadbeds, bridges, and tunnels to the laying of sleepers, rails, and the manufacture of steel rails, so that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway reached the standards that a new type of railway should have.
    In the recovery and development of our country's agricultural production, Soviet experts have also made great efforts. They vigorously introduced advanced agricultural scientific theories and the experience of socialist agricultural construction, and specifically helped Chinese farmers improve farming techniques and use new agricultural implements. They also provided valuable experience for the consolidation and development of our country's forestry industry. What should be particularly mentioned is that Chinese farmers once sent their own delegation to the Soviet Union this year to visit, and were warmly welcomed by the Soviet government and people. They visited many state farms, collective farms, agricultural machinery stations, and huge communist construction projects in the Soviet Union. This delegation brought back countless facts that they saw with their own eyes from the Soviet Union, which are the examples of the new China's agriculture. They will undoubtedly promote the vast number of farmers in our country to embark on the road to collectivization and a prosperous material and cultural life.
    Here, we should also especially thank Comrade Bukov, a Soviet expert, who made indelible contributions to our great Huai River management project and the Jingjiang River flood diversion project. With his help, we determined the large-scale reservoir project and flood storage project plan for Huai River management; in the Jingjiang River flood diversion project, he designed the construction of gates without piles, the opening and closing of flood gate doors, and the famous "Bukov trough."
    The work of Soviet experts and the introduction of advanced Soviet experience also play a huge role in the reform and development of our country's cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings. Various theories and ideas belonging to the bourgeois ideological system and contrary to the interests of the people have been strictly criticized, and advanced Soviet scientific theories and technologies are being widely learned and accepted by the vast number of Chinese people, especially intellectuals. The content, system, organization, and methods of cultural, educational, and health undertakings are being reformed victoriously on the basis of learning from advanced Soviet experience and gradually combining it with our country's actual situation. All these are great driving forces for the advent of the high tide of our country's economic construction and cultural construction.
    Here, we must especially emphasize that we learn from the Soviet Union, not only to learn advanced Soviet scientific and technological knowledge. Learning in this aspect is of course extremely important. But this alone is not enough. We must also learn the high degree of internationalism and patriotism shown by the Soviet communists and the Soviet people under the personal teaching and training of Lenin and Stalin, their collectivism and selfless labor spirit, their great determination to transform the world, their perseverance and courage in not fearing difficulties and overcoming all difficulties, their vigor and optimism, their sensitivity to new things, their love for new things and their spirit of courage to create, and their lofty communist morality. All these, we should learn well, in order to guide the people of our country to be more confident in safeguarding the security of the motherland, safeguarding world peace, completing the construction of new democracy, and steadily moving towards socialism.
    For three years, in the great and sacred work of consolidating and developing Sino-Soviet friendship and learning from Soviet experience, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has made great efforts. With the development of the work, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has become the largest mass organization in the country. The number of members has increased from 17.3 million to 38.9 million in the past year, an expansion of 125 percent. Now the organization of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has spread throughout the country, with a total of seven general branches, 13 municipal branches directly under the central and major administrative regions, 32 provincial branches, 80 municipal branches under provinces, and 1,771 county branches. The number of grassroots organizations of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association – branches – has increased from 44,778 a year ago to the current 119,978. Since the National Congress of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was held in October last year, the propaganda team and propaganda position of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have been greatly expanded, and the work has gradually become in-depth.
    In order to further consolidate the great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and to create a higher upsurge of learning from the Soviet Union among the vast number of people in our country, the General Association of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has decided to hold a nationwide "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" movement in November this year. This movement will be another great demonstration of the people's peace forces to the imperialist aggressive camp following the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference, and also another important preparation for the World People's Peace Conference in December this year. At the same time, it is also a resounding prelude to our great motherland entering large-scale economic construction and cultural construction. By then, all Chinese people, regardless of workers, farmers, intellectuals, business circles, and all ethnic groups, will be mobilized to welcome and hold this grand "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Our great ally, the Soviet Union, will also send its own delegation and art troupe to our country to celebrate and participate in this grand movement, and to have extensive contact with the vast number of people in our country.
    In the past three years, our motherland has achieved great victories on all fronts. In the future, the central task of the people of our country is to continue to strengthen national defense forces, safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, and comprehensively and systematically carry out large-scale economic construction and cultural construction, so that our country will steadily develop towards the socialist future. In order to meet and complete this arduous task, there is a decisive condition, which is to continue to consolidate and develop the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and to intensify the study of advanced Soviet experience. All members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and all the people of China will, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the kind attention and help of the Soviet people and their government, make a hundredfold effort to fully utilize and develop this condition to complete the above-mentioned glorious and great task.
    Long live the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!

    巩固中苏友好，加紧学习苏联先进经验
    中苏友好协会总会总干事  钱俊瑞
    中苏两国人民的友好合作是远东与世界和平最可靠的保障。毛主席教导我们说：“中苏两国强大的同盟是不可战胜的力量，是反对帝国主义侵略和维护远东和平及安全的坚强保证，也是争取世界和平的伟大事业胜利的保证。”三年来的事实，完全证实了毛主席这个英明的论断。帝国主义者的侵略阴谋已经不断地遭受到以伟大苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的沉重打击。以中苏同盟为基础的世界和平民主力量正在蓬勃地发展和壮大，并已远远超过帝国主义侵略阵营的力量。最近中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国政府的公告和关于延长共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文，对于保证远东与世界和平是一个极其重要的措施。它大大地鼓舞了全世界爱好和平的人民；同时又狠狠地给美帝国主义勾结日本军国主义势力的罪恶阴谋以当头一棒。
    中苏两国人民的友好合作更是新中国建设成功的重要保证。
    三年以来，苏联政府根据了中苏贷款和贸易协定，给予我国以大量的物资援助，为我国经济的恢复，尤其是我国的工业化，提供了重要的物质、技术条件。在斯大林同志的亲切关怀和指导下，苏联政府还派遣了大批优秀的专家来到我国，以伟大的国际主义精神，和我国劳动人民在一起，真诚无私地帮助新中国的建设。他们将苏联先进科学技术和生产经验毫无保留地交给中国人民，为新中国培养了大批建设人才，节约和增加了大量的财富，大大缩短了新中国各英建设的过程。
    举例来说吧。在工业方面，由于苏联的先进经验“快速检修法”在东北的推广，便使该区电业系统为国家创造了价值八千余吨粮食的财富。苏联专家将苏联机器工业中的高速切削法传授给我国工人，使机床效率提高了数倍到数十倍。苏联的先进生产经验“平行作业法”大大缩短了我国煤矿竖井工程建设的时间，东北西安矿务局因为推广了这种先进经验，可以使大规模竖井工程提前五年完成。苏联先进经验“郭瓦廖夫工作法”在我国许多生产部门的推广，对我国工业生产率的提高起了极大的作用。苏联“按指示图表组织有节奏的生产”的先进经验在我国的运用，使我国企业管理方法起了重大的改革。
    三年来，新中国铁路事业的突飞猛进更是和苏联专家的帮助分不开的。特别值得提起的是中国长春铁路的光辉成绩。两年多来中国长春铁路的苏联专家为我们培养了一万六千三百余名能掌握管理企业的先进方法的职工；截至一九五一年年底，获得推广的苏联铁路工作先进方法达一百三十余种。由于我国铁路员工学习了苏联先进经验和中苏两国铁路职工的共同努力，一九五一年中国长春铁路的劳动生产率较一九五○年提高了百分之二十七点八，支出较原定计划节省了七百二十三亿余元，由于车辆周转加速而获得的利润超过计划一万亿元。又如成渝铁路提前完工，于今年七月一日通车，在短短的两年内实现了四川人民四十多年来的希望，更是我国劳动人民的创造天才和苏联社会主义建设经验相结合的光辉范例。在这个工程的施工过程中，从路基、桥梁、隧道的建筑直至铺枕木、铺铁轨和制造钢轨，都广泛采用了苏联先进经验，因而使成渝铁路达到了新型铁路应有的标准。
    在我国农业生产的恢复和发展方面，苏联专家也作了巨大的努力。他们大力介绍先进的农业科学理论和社会主义农业建设的经验，具体地帮助我国农民改进农作技术，使用新式农具。他们对我国森林业的整理和发展也提供了宝贵的经验。特别应当提出的，我国农民今年曾经派遣自己的代表团到苏联去参观，受到苏联政府和人民的热烈欢迎，他们在苏联参观了很多国营农场、集体农场、农业机器站和巨大的共产主义建设工程。这个代表团从苏联带回来了无数亲眼看到的事实，这些就是新中国农业的榜样，它们无疑地将推动我国广大农民走向集体化和富裕的物质文化生活的大道。
    在这里，我们还应该特别感谢苏联专家布可夫同志，他在我们巨大的治淮工程和荆江分洪工程中，作了不可磨灭的贡献。在他的帮助下，我们确定了治淮的大规模的水库工程和蓄洪工程计划；在荆江分洪工程中，他设计了建闸不打桩、进洪闸闸门的启闭及著名的“布可夫槽”等。
    苏联专家的工作和苏联先进经验的介绍，对我国文化、教育、科学、卫生事业的改革和发展也起着巨大的作用。属于资产阶级思想体系的与人民利益相违背的各种学说和思想受到了严格的批判，苏联先进的科学理论和技术正广泛地为中国广大人民，首先是知识分子所学习和接受。文教卫生事业的内容、制度、组织和方法，正在学习苏联先进经验并与我国实际逐步结合的基础上胜利地进行着改革。所有这些对我国经济建设和文化建设高潮的来临都是极大的推动力量。
    在这里我们要特别强调地说一下，我们学苏联，不止要学苏联先进的科学技术知识。这一方面的学习当然是极重要的。但是单单这一点还不够，我们更加要学习在列宁和斯大林的亲自教导和培养之下的苏联的共产党员和苏联人民所表现的高度的国际主义和爱国主义精神，他们的集体主义和忘我的劳动精神，他们的改造世界的伟大决心，不怕困难和战胜一切困难的坚毅和勇敢精神，他们的朝气蓬勃和乐观主义，他们对新鲜事物的敏感，对新生事物的热爱和勇于创造的精神，以及他们的崇高的共产主义道德。所有这些，我们都应当好好学习，以引导我国人民更加信心百倍地来保卫祖国的安全，保卫世界和平，完成新民主主义的建设，稳步地走向社会主义。
    三年以来，在巩固和发展中苏友谊、学习苏联经验的巨大和神圣的工作中，中苏友好协会曾经尽了极大的力量。随着工作的开展，中苏友好协会已经成为全国最庞大的群众团体，会员人数一年来从一千七百三十万人增加到三千八百九十万人，即扩大了百分之一百二十五，现在中苏友好协会的组织已普及全国，计有总分会七个，中央及大行政区直属市分会十三个，省分会三十二个，省属市分会八十个，县分会一千七百七十一个。中苏友好协会的基层组织——支会的数目已从一年前的四万四千七百七十八个增加到现在的十一万九千九百七十八个。从去年十月举行中苏友好协会全国代表会议以后，中苏友好协会的宣传队伍和宣传阵地是大大扩大了，工作也逐步地走向深入了。
    为了进一步巩固中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，为了在我国广大人民中掀起更高的学习苏联的热潮，中苏友好协会总会决定在今年十一月间举行全国规模的“中苏友好月”运动。这一运动将是人民和平力量继亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议之后的又一次向帝国主义侵略阵营的大示威，也是今年十二月世界人民和平大会的另一项重要的准备。它同时又是我们伟大祖国进入大规模经济建设和文化建设的响亮的前奏曲。到那时，全中国人民，不问工人、农民、知识分子、工商界和各民族，都将动员起来，迎接和举行这个盛大的“中苏友好月”。我们的伟大盟邦苏联也将派遣自己的代表团和文艺工作团来到我国，庆贺和参加这一盛大的运动，并与我国广大人民作广泛的接触。
    三年来我们的祖国在各条战线上都取得了伟大的胜利。今后我国人民的中心任务就是继续增强国防力量，保卫远东和世界的和平，并全面地有计划地进行大规模的经济建设和文化建设，使我们的国家稳步地向社会主义的前途发展。为了迎接和完成这一艰巨任务，有一个决定性的条件，就是继续巩固和发展中苏两国的友好合作，加紧学习苏联的先进经验。中苏友好协会的全体会员和全中国的人民将在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，同时将在苏联人民及其政府的亲切关注和帮助下，百倍地努力，充分运用和发展这个条件，来完成上述光荣和伟大的任务。
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的伟大的友谊万岁！
