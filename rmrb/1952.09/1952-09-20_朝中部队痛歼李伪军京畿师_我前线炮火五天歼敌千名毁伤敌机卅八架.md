Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, September 19th: The battle for two hilltops near Jwaseo-dong and Gyoryang-san in the Geumseong southeastern area of the central front continues fiercely. From the evening of September 6th to the 14th, over nine days, our army inflicted heavy losses on the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Capital Division, which the American aggressors praised as an "elite unit," on these two hills; the Capital Division has been annihilated by more than 1,500 men in these nine days.

American news agencies had arrogantly called the hilltop near Jwaseo-dong "Capital Hill" and boasted that the defending Capital Division was the "model" of the Syngman Rhee dog army. However, by September 7th, American news agencies reported in terror that the Capital Division had been "driven away" from "Capital Hill."

After our army captured the enemy's "Capital Hill" position on the evening of the 6th, it bravely attacked the enemy forces coming to counterattack, killing or wounding more than 400 enemy soldiers in three days. After the 10th, our army sometimes took the initiative to withdraw from the hilltop after severely punishing the counterattacking enemy; at other times, it suddenly charged up the hilltop with the cooperation of fierce artillery fire, killing the enemies who were dizzy from the artillery fire in trenches and craters. In the three days from the 10th to the 12th, our army launched three counterattacks, annihilating most of five platoons of the defending enemy.

On a hilltop northeast of Gyoryang-san, our army also inflicted heavy losses on the enemy troops using the same tactics as in the battle for the hilltop near Jwaseo-dong. After our army captured this hilltop position in one fell swoop on the 6th, the enemy launched frantic counterattacks for several consecutive days, but was repelled by our fierce artillery fire and various gunfires. On the 13th alone, our army repelled ten enemy counterattacks. During the ninth counterattack, the enemy once climbed to the front line of our position, but was immediately driven back by our army. On this day, our army annihilated a total of 250 enemy soldiers.

During the battle for these two hilltops, our artillerymen subjected the enemy to fierce artillery fire that, as the enemy said, was "unimaginable;" they sometimes blasted the enemy to pieces on the way to attack; at other times, they let the enemy get onto the hilltop, and then buried them in a sea of fire with fierce artillery fire. An Associated Press reporter fearfully described the impact of our army's fierce artillery fire on the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Capital Division, saying: "Shells turned the trenches leading to Capital Hill into a strange cemetery. The arms, legs and heads of dead South Korean soldiers are piled high."

In the five days from September 11th to 15th, in other areas of the front, our army also continuously inflicted heavy losses on or ambushed enemy soldiers who came to intrude, killing or wounding about 270 enemy soldiers.

Our frontline troops continue to punish the American aerial bandits who are frantically slaughtering the Korean people. According to incomplete statistics from the 11th to the 15th, nine enemy aircraft were shot down and twenty-nine enemy aircraft were damaged. In these five days, our frontline artillery fire killed or wounded nearly a thousand enemy soldiers, and destroyed or damaged eighteen enemy tanks and nineteen enemy vehicles.

### 朝中部队痛歼李伪军京畿师  我前线炮火五天歼敌千名毁伤敌机卅八架

    朝中部队痛歼李伪军京畿师
    我前线炮火五天歼敌千名毁伤敌机卅八架
    【新华社朝鲜前线十九日电】在中线金城东南地区座首洞和轿岩山附近两个山头的争夺战仍然在激烈地进行着。自九月六日傍晚到十四日的九天中，我军在这两个山地上给予被美国侵略者夸奖为“精锐部队”的李伪军京畿师以惨重的打击；京畿师在这九天中已经被歼灭了一千五百多名。
    美国通讯社曾经把座首洞附近的山头狂妄地称为“京畿山”，并将守敌京畿师夸耀成李承晚走狗军的“榜样”。但是到了九月七日，美国通讯社却惊恐地供称京畿师被从“京畿山”上“赶走”了。
    六日晚上，我军攻取了敌人的“京畿山”阵地之后，便奋勇地打击前来反扑的敌人，在三天中毙伤敌人四百余名。到十日以后，我军有时在痛击反扑的敌人之后主动撤离山头；有时又突然在猛烈炮火的配合下冲上山头，将被炮火打得头昏脑胀的敌人击毙在壕沟和弹坑里。在十日到十二日三天中，我军先后举行三次反击，歼灭守敌五个排的大部。
    在轿岩山东北的一座山头上，我军也用像在座首洞附近山头争夺战中所采取的战法痛歼敌军。我军在六日一举攻占了这个山头阵地后，敌军连日进行疯狂的反扑，但却被我猛烈炮火和各种枪火所击退。仅十三日一天中，我军就击退了敌军十次反扑。敌军在第九次反扑中，曾一度爬到我军阵地的前沿，但当即被我军逐退。这一天我军共歼敌二百五十名。
    在这两个山头争夺战中，我军炮手们使敌人吃到了如敌人所说的“不能想像”的猛烈炮火；他们有时用炮弹把敌军炸烂在进攻的途中；有时把敌人放到山头上，然后用猛烈的炮火把他们埋葬在火海里。美联社记者惊惧地描述我军猛烈炮火给予李伪军京畿师的打击说：“炮弹把通向京畿山的战壕搞得像一块奇怪的墓地。被击毙的大韩民国士兵的手臂、腿和头颅堆积如山。”
    九月十一日到十五日五天中，在前线其他地区，我军也不断痛歼或伏击前来窜犯的敌人，杀伤敌人共约二百七十多名。    
    我前线部队继续痛惩疯狂地屠杀朝鲜人民的美国空中强盗，据十一日至十五日的不完全统计，共击落敌机九架，击伤敌机二十九架。我前线炮火在这五天中，共杀伤敌军近千人，击毁击伤敌军坦克十八辆、汽车十九辆。
