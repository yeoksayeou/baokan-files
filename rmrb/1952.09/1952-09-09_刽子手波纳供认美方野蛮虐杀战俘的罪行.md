Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th. The truth about a series of prisoner of war massacres in American prisoner of war camps has now been confessed by Bonner himself, the former head of the American prisoner of war camp who orchestrated these events.

According to the Associated Press, executioner Bonner, upon returning home after being promoted for his "meritorious" service to the American aggressive policy of massacring prisoners of war, gave a talk in San Antonio about the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp. In his speech, Bonner admitted that the American side used medieval barbaric methods to abuse Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. He admitted that the American side formed prisoners of war into "work camps," forcing them to "work with all their strength" in an attempt to force them to abandon their firm desire to be repatriated to their home countries, or simply torturing them to death. He also blatantly and shamelessly said: "If you see a fanatical communist and you put a pair of tongs or a gun behind him, he will be immediately shocked and appear even more fanatical." As everyone knows, this cruel and ruthless executioner has repeatedly claimed that his actions were based on the Geneva Convention, but the facts prove that he is the most barbaric violator of the Geneva Convention. The Geneva Convention does not allow him to use tongs and guns to deal with any prisoners of war, regardless of their political beliefs. On the contrary, Article 16 of the Geneva Convention clearly stipulates: "The Detaining Power shall treat all prisoners of war...without any adverse distinction based on race, nationality, religious belief or political opinions, or any other distinction founded on similar criteria." Article 13 of the Convention further stipulates: "Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and shall be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention."

Bonner now openly violates the Geneva Convention, using tongs and guns to maim and kill prisoners of war, simply because they firmly demand repatriation to their homeland and refuse to be cannon fodder for the American aggressors. This shows the complete falsity of Bonner's lies about prisoner of war "riots" and "uprisings." Bonner's shameless remarks irrefutably confirm the appalling crimes of persecution and massacre of prisoners of war that Bonner's predecessor, Colson, had admitted, and also prove that Bonner himself is a war criminal who will be severely punished in an international court.

In his speech, Bonner also admitted that there are still 150,000 prisoners of war in American prisoner of war camps, including 20,000 Chinese. Everyone remembers that Harrison openly declared that he did not have as many prisoners of war demanding repatriation from the Korean and Chinese side as they claimed, especially not 20,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war. Bonner, in his capacity as the person in charge of the American prisoner of war camp, has now given Harrison a resounding slap in the face, and has once again exposed to the world the shameless tricks of the American side in creating various obstacles on the prisoner of war issue to delay the armistice negotiations.

### 刽子手波纳供认美方野蛮虐杀战俘的罪行

    刽子手波纳供认美方野蛮虐杀战俘的罪行
    【新华社开城八日电】在美方战俘营中发生的一连串屠杀战俘事件的真相，现在已经由一手制造这些事件的前美方战俘营负责人波纳自己招认出来了。
    据美联社报道说：刽子手波纳在因为屠杀战俘对美国侵略政策有“功”而升官回国的时候，在圣安东尼奥发表了关于巨济岛战俘营的谈话。波纳在谈话中承认美方用中世纪的野蛮手段虐待朝中战俘。他承认美方将战俘编成“工作营”，强迫他们“全力工作”，企图用苦役迫使他们放弃要求遣返祖国的坚决愿望，或者干脆将他们折磨至死。他还公然无耻地说：“假使你看到了一个狂热的共产党人，而你把一把火钳或一支枪挺在他的背后的话，他会立刻大吃一惊，而且表示得更狂热。”大家知道，这个狠毒残忍的刽子手曾经一再宣称他的所作所为都是根据日内瓦公约的，但是事实证明，他是日内瓦公约的最野蛮的破坏者。日内瓦公约并没有允许他用火钳和枪去对付任何战俘，不论他的政治信仰是什么。相反，日内瓦公约第十六条明文规定：“拘留国对于所有战俘，……不得基于种族、国籍、宗教信仰、或政治意见，或根据类似标准之任何其他区别而有所歧视。”公约第十三条更规定：“战俘在任何时候均须受人道之待遇。拘留国任何不法行为或不行为可致其看管中之战俘死亡或严重危害其健康者，须予禁止，并当视为严重破坏本公约之行为。”
    波纳现在公然破坏日内瓦公约，用火钳和枪去残伤战俘的肢体，杀害战俘的性命，只因为他们坚决要求遣返祖国，拒绝替美国侵略者充当炮灰。这就说明了波纳所谓战俘“骚乱”、“暴动”等等谎话的彻底虚伪。波纳的无耻谈话，无可置辩地证实了波纳的前任柯尔生曾经承认过的种种迫害、屠杀战俘的令人发指的罪行，也证明了波纳自己是一个将要在国际法庭上受到严厉惩罚的战争罪犯。
    波纳在谈话中还承认，在美方战俘营中至今还有十五万战俘，其中有两万是中国人。大家记得，哈利逊曾经公开宣称他手中没有朝中方面要求遣返的那么多的战俘，特别是没有两万名中国人民志愿军战俘。波纳现在以美方战俘营负责人的身份给哈利逊吃了一记响亮的耳光，并且又一次向全世界暴露了美方在战俘问题上制造种种障碍来拖延停战谈判的无耻伎俩。
