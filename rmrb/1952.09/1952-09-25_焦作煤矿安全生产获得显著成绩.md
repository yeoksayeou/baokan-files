The leadership and the vast number of workers at the state-owned Jiaozuo Coal Mine have established the principle of "safety first," resulting in remarkable achievements in safe production. In the first half of this year, the mine completely eliminated fatal accidents, and the rate of work-related injuries per 10,000 tons of coal produced decreased by 90% compared to 1949. Eleven Liu Jiuxue-style model teams for safe production and ninety-nine model groups have emerged throughout the mine. The Liu Jiuxue team has so far created a record of forty-one consecutive months of safe production, while the four groups led by Xu Jijun, Pan Zhenbang, Lian Zhaoyin, and Wu Guoyin have also achieved a record of one thousand days without accidents. Due to the guarantee of safe production, the mine workers completed 69.79% of the year's production increase and economy drive plan in the first half of this year. In August, in addition to fulfilling the state production plan, they also exceeded the monthly production increase and economy drive plan.

The establishment of safe production ideology by the leadership and the vast number of workers at Jiaozuo Coal Mine has gone through a period of struggle. In the early days after liberation, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine leadership did not pay enough attention to safe production, which led to an explosion accident in the second half of 1949, resulting in the death of twenty-one workers. Later, the North China Coal Industry Cadre Conference summarized the causes of the accidents in various mines, pointing out that the main reason was that leading cadres did not pay enough attention to safety work, and demanded a vigorous change in this situation. Only then did the leading cadres of Jiaozuo Coal Mine begin to pay attention to safety work. However, at that time, their confidence was still insufficient, because the mine's equipment was poor and severely damaged by the enemy and puppets before liberation, so they felt that deaths and injuries were difficult to avoid completely. However, after they adopted some measures in the Huangtugang mine to try out safe production, no deaths or serious injuries occurred among the more than 400 workers in the entire mine in the first month. This achievement inspired all the mine workers and greatly increased the confidence of the leadership, making them firmly realize that safe production is entirely possible. Based on this idea, the Jiaozuo Coal Mine leadership further found the key to achieving safe production: that is, everyone must establish a safe production ideology. Therefore, they adopted a series of measures, such as strengthening political and safety education for workers and staff, mobilizing veteran workers to put forward safe production experience for exchange among the vast number of workers, commending safe production models, running safety production personnel training courses, launching workers to formulate safe production covenants, and conducting regular safety inspections. Their slogan is "Safety first, everyone is responsible for safety." The emergence of Liu Jiuxue team's new record of seventeen months of safe production in 1950 further strengthened the leadership's confidence in safe production. Workers and staff universally launched a campaign to learn from Liu Jiuxue's safe production, gradually changing the long-standing erroneous ideas of "going down the mine is a disaster" and "four pieces of stone sandwiched with a piece of meat, how can it not hurt people," actively trying to improve technical operations, and everyone paying attention to safe production. Since 1951, on the original basis, they have gradually established various safe production systems and safety regulations, such as the shift handover system, gas inspection system, and engineering specification inspection system. At the same time, they improved and added many safety facilities, such as underground ventilation that now ensures every worker can universally receive three cubic meters of air per minute.

Xinhua News Agency:
At present, Jiaozuo Coal Mine is universally promoting the safe production experience of Liu Jiuxue and Jia Maishou, which was summarized by the North China Safe Production Group Representative Conference, and is conducting a comprehensive safety inspection. In this year's second-half patriotic production increase and economy drive plan, they have further proposed the goal of eliminating serious injuries throughout the mine, reducing minor injuries by 50% in the Wangfeng Mine, reducing minor injuries by 30% in the Lifeng Mine, and completely eliminating minor injuries in the Electromechanical Plant.

### 焦作煤矿安全生产获得显著成绩

    焦作煤矿安全生产获得显著成绩
    国营焦作煤矿领导方面和广大职工树立“安全第一”思想，在安全生产方面获得了显著成绩。今年上半年，全矿已完全消灭死亡事故，每产一万吨煤的工伤事故也比一九四九年减少百分之九十。全矿出现了十一个刘九学式的安全生产模范班和九十九个模范组，其中刘九学班到现在为止已创造了四十一个月安全生产的最高纪录，许继均、潘振邦、连兆银、毋国银等四个小组也创造了千日无事故的纪录。由于安全生产的保证，全矿职工在今年上半年就完成了全年增产节约计划的百分之六十九点七九；八月份除完成国家生产计划外，又超额完成了全月的增产节约计划。
    焦作煤矿领导方面和广大职工树立安全生产思想，是经过了一段斗争过程的。解放初期焦作煤矿领导方面对安全生产也是很不重视的，所以该矿曾在一九四九年下半年发生爆炸事故，死亡工人二十一人。之后，华北煤业干部会议，总结了各矿发生事故的原因。指出主要是领导干部对保安工作重视不够，并要求大力改变这种情况。这样焦作煤矿领导干部对保安工作才重视起来。但是当时他们的信心还是不够的。因为矿上的设备差，解放前受敌伪破坏很严重，所以他们觉得死伤事故很难完全避免。可是他们在黄土岗矿井采取了一些办法试行安全生产后，第一个月内全矿井四百多工人竟没有发生死亡和重伤。这个成绩振奋了全矿职工，也大大提高了领导方面的信心，使他们肯定地认识到安全生产是完全可以做到的。焦作煤矿领导方面在这一思想基础上进一步找到了实现安全生产的钥匙：便是人人建立安全生产的思想。于是他们采用了一系列的办法；如加强对工人职员的政治教育、保安教育，发动老工人提出安全生产经验在广大工人中交流，表扬安全生产模范，开办安全生产人员训练班，发动工人订安全生产公约，定期进行保安检查等。他们的口号是“安全第一，人人保安”。一九五○年刘九学班安全生产十七个月的新纪录出现，更加强了领导方面对于安全生产的信心。工人职员普遍展开了学习刘九学安全生产的运动，逐渐转变了长期存在的“下井三分灾”“四块石头夹块肉，那能不伤人”的错误思想，积极设法改进技术操作，人人注意安全生产。一九五一年起，他们在原有基础上更逐步建立了各种安全生产制度和保安规程。如交接班制、瓦斯检查制、工程规格检验制度等；同时改善和增加了许多安全设备，如井下通风已使每个工人普遍可以得到每分钟三立方公尺的风量等。
    目前，焦作煤矿正在普遍推广华北安全生产小组代表会议所总结的刘九学、贾麦收安全生产经验，并进行全面地保安大检查。在今年下半年的爱国增产节约计划中，他们更进一步提出了全矿消灭重伤事故和王封矿减少轻伤百分之五十、李封矿减少轻伤百分之三十、机电厂完全消灭轻伤的奋斗目标。（新华社）
