    “There are no insurmountable difficulties!”
    ——Remembering Comrade Zhang Lefeng's diligent study of culture
    "Can a deaf person still learn culture?" Volunteer Army convalescent Zhang Lefeng gave an affirmative answer based on his own experience: "As long as you have a strong will, any difficulty can be overcome!"
    Comrade Zhang Lefeng was a soldier in a certain unit of the Volunteer Army and a member of the Communist Youth League. During the Fifth Battle, in a fierce defensive battle, he suffered hearing loss in both ears from the explosions and could not hear people speaking face to face. In January of this year, he was sent back to the motherland for recuperation.
    Deafness is a distressing thing. Zhang Lefeng had thought more than once: "How can I serve the people in the future?" The education of the Party and the Communist Youth League over the years had given him a strong will. Especially in the half-year since returning to China, he was encouraged by the great construction and beautiful prospects of the motherland, and he gradually overcame his feelings of distress. He said, "As long as my heart is still beating, I will continue to work hard for the people." He was determined to work hard to improve his cultural level to compensate for his deafness. However, his family was very poor before he joined the revolution and he had never attended school for a single day; after joining the revolution, he only learned about two hundred characters. Now he had to start from scratch, and he couldn't hear, so what could he do? At this time, he remembered what the commander said before a certain battle on the Korean front: "There are no insurmountable difficulties in front of the Volunteer Army!" So he mustered his courage and resolutely plunged into a new battle on the cultural front.
    The rapid literacy method created by Comrade Qi Jianhua spread throughout the hospital. However, Zhang Lefeng could neither read newspapers nor hear people speak, and only learned a little from picture books and the actions of his comrades. One day, he went to a nearby unit to see them teaching phonetic symbols. He stood aside and watched for a while, thinking to himself, maybe this is the new literacy method? When he came back and asked, the comrades nodded in agreement. From then on, he went there to watch every day. The instructor noticed and asked him, "Do you want to learn?" But he couldn't hear. The instructor knew he was deaf and gave him a phonetic symbol chart. He treasured it like a precious object, took it back, and asked Comrade Li Zhuocheng (a Communist Party member) in his ward to teach him. The difficulties of learning were indeed present. At the beginning of teaching, although some symbols could be expressed using the characters he had learned in the past, and some symbols could be expressed using pictures and objects in the book, some symbols could not be expressed using the above methods. There was no way, Zhang Lefeng had to imitate the shape of Li Zhuocheng's mouth when he pronounced the sounds. If he read it correctly, Li Zhuocheng would nod; if not, he would start again. He learned so arduously, and for one symbol, sometimes it took most of the day to get it right. But neither of them ever frowned. Because one was a Communist Party member and the other was a member of the Communist Youth League, they would not bow their heads in the face of difficulties.
    After learning the pronunciation of a few symbols, Zhang Lefeng let Li Zhuocheng rest, and he went out and sat on the ground, reading and drawing. The sun shone on his head, and he was sweating profusely, but he didn't care. Once he was familiar with the symbols and could write them, he would come back and ask Li Zhuocheng to continue teaching him. In this way, in seven days, he learned all the phonetic symbols.
    As soon as Zhang Lefeng learned the phonetic symbols, he immediately began to learn individual characters. There were still many difficulties: he could read many characters, but it was very difficult to understand their meaning. He persevered tirelessly, learning while sitting, learning while walking, and asking everyone he met. At this time, Zhang Lefeng's spirit of learning had spread throughout the hospital. Many comrades were moved by his spirit of learning, and they all automatically helped him. With more teachers, there were also more methods, and the difficulties were overcome one by one. In two months, he had learned more than 1,100 characters and could now write letters.
    The movement to learn culture in the hospital began, and he served as the group leader of Group C in the third ward. He Yaohua and Xiang Chengde, two convalescents, did not have much confidence in learning, so he patiently and carefully helped them, which greatly moved them and strengthened their confidence in learning.
    At the hospital's second convalescent representative conference, Zhang Lefeng's moving story of learning culture was commended. When comrades from the hospital's propaganda section went to visit him, he said, "This is just the beginning, and it is still far from the requirements of the Party and my goals. I will continue to work hard, and I ask comrades to help me more in the future." Zhang Dehou

### “没有克服不了的困难！”——记张乐峰同志刻苦学习文化

    “没有克服不了的困难！”
    ——记张乐峰同志刻苦学习文化
    “一个人的耳朵聋了，还能学习文化吗？”志愿军休养员张乐峰同志以他亲身的经历作了肯定的答复：“只要有坚强的意志，任何困难都是可以克服的！”
    张乐峰同志是志愿军某部的战士，青年团员。五次战役时，在激烈的坚守战中，他两耳受震失灵，对面说话也听不到。今年一月间，他被送回祖国休养。
    耳朵聋了，这是一件使人苦恼的事情。张乐峰曾不只一次地想：“今后我怎样来为人民服务呢？”几年来党和青年团的教育，使他有了坚强的意志。特别是回国半年来，他亲眼见到祖国的伟大建设和美好远景鼓舞着他，他逐渐克服了苦恼的情绪。他说：“只要我的心还在跳，我就要继续为人民好好工作。”他决心努力提高文化来弥补耳朵聋的缺陷。但是，他在参加革命前家里很穷，没有念过一天书；参加革命后也只学会了两百来个字。现在要从头学起，耳朵又听不见，怎么办呢？这时，他记起在朝鲜前线某次战斗前首长讲的话：“在志愿军面前没有克服不了的困难！”于是他鼓起了勇气，坚强地投入了文化战线上的一个新的战斗。
    祁建华同志创造的速成识字法，传遍了医院。但张乐峰既不会看书报，也听不见人说话，只从画报上和同志们行动上知道了一点。有一天，他到医院附近的一个部队去，人家正在教注音符号。他站在一旁看了一阵，心里想，这也许就是新识字法吧？回来一问，同志们点头说对。从此，他天天到那里去看。教员发现了，就问他：“你是不是想学？”可是他听不见。教员知道他是一个聋子，就送给他一张注音符号表。他如获至宝一样，拿了回来，要求同病室的李卓成同志
    （共产党员）教他。学习的困难的确是存在的。开始教学的时候，有的符号虽然可以用他过去识的字来表明发音，有一些符号可以用书上的图和实物比划发音；但有一些符号却无法用以上的方法来表明发音。没办法，张乐峰就只好根据李卓成发音时的口形来模仿。读对了，李卓成就点头；不对，又重来。就这样坚苦地学，为了一个符号，有时搞了大半天也没搞对。但他们两人从来连眉毛也不皱一下。因为他们一个是共产党员，一个是青年团员，在困难面前是不会低头的。
    学会了几个符号的发音，张乐峰就让李卓成休息，自己出来坐在地上，一面读一面画。太阳晒在头上，他热得满头大汗，但毫不理会。符号记熟了，会写了，他又回来请李卓成继续教。就这样，在七天的时间内，他把注音符号全学会了。
    张乐峰学会了注音符号，就马上开始学单字。困难还是很多：很多字他能读，但要搞清字义却很不容易。他始终不懈地坚持着，坐下学，走路学，而且逢人便问。这时，张乐峰的学习精神已传遍了全院。很多同志被他的学习精神感动了，大家都自动帮助他。老师多了，办法也多了，困难一个一个被克服了。两个月的时间，他已学会了一千一百多字，现在已能写信了。
    医院学文化的运动开始了，他担任第三病室丙组的小组长。何耀华、相成德两个休养员学习信心不大，他便耐心仔细地帮助他们，使他们很受感动，加强了学习信心。
    在医院第二届休养员代表大会上，张乐峰学文化的动人事迹受到了表扬。医院宣传股的同志去访问他时，他说：“这仅是开始，距党的要求和我的目标还远得很。我还要继续努力，请同志们今后多多帮助我。”  张德厚
