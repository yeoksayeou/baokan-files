    The Crops of the Xue Mantai Agricultural Production Cooperative Are Growing Well

    Comrade Editor: We are members of an agricultural production cooperative in Xiaoshentou Village, Fifth District, Lishi County, Shanxi Province. Our production cooperative was established in April of this year. The entire cooperative has ten households, ten male laborers, seven female laborers, and 277 mu of cultivated land.

    This year, our cultivated land has been planted "according to the land" (only agricultural production cooperatives can do this), and the crops are growing particularly well. In mid-August, the masses in the village came to our cooperative for "field observation" and unanimously agreed that the crops of the mutual aid teams could not compare to those of our production cooperative. We estimate that our high-yield field's millet can produce an average of 625 jin per mu, and corn can produce 750 jin (more than double the local average yield). Huo Shengwen, the deputy leader of the first mutual aid team in the village, said: "Although there are also good crops in the mutual aid teams, because the land is cultivated by each household separately, it is impossible for every mu to grow as well as in the agricultural production cooperative."

    In the past six months, our production cooperative has received full leadership and assistance from the Party and the government, and we have also received state loans, which have solved various difficulties in our production. We have signed a three-way combination contract with the local supply and marketing cooperative and credit cooperative, which guarantees the supply of production and living materials and the marketing of agricultural and sideline products for our cooperative. The members are studying well. In the past, the cooperative subscribed to the Shanxi Peasant Daily, Propaganda Handbook, and North China People's Daily, one copy each. In August, we added the Shanxi Daily and the Young Pioneer Newspaper, one copy each, and in September, we plan to subscribe to the Shanxi Pictorial. The members read the newspaper on the fields every day and also study for one hour every evening.

    All members of the Xue Mantai Agricultural Production Cooperative

### 薛满泰农业生产合作社的庄稼长得好

    薛满泰农业生产合作社的庄稼长得好
    编辑同志：我们是山西省离石县五区小神头村一个农业生产合作社的社员。我们的生产合作社是在今年四月成立的。全社共十户，男劳力十人，女劳力七人，耕地二百七十七亩。
    今年我们的耕地是“因地种植”的（只有农业生产合作社才能作到这一点），庄稼长得特别好。八月中旬，村里群众到我们社里进行“田间观摩”，一致认为互助组的庄稼比不上我们生产合作社的好。我们丰产田的谷子估计每亩平均可产六百二十五斤，玉茭可产七百五十斤（超过当地一般产量一倍）。村里互助组第一组副组长霍生文说：“互助组里虽然也有好庄稼，但因为土地是各自养种，总不能像农业生产合作社那样亩亩都长得好。”
    半年来，我们的生产合作社受到党和政府的全力领导和帮助，又得到国家的贷款，我们生产上的各种困难都解决了。我们和本地供销合作社、信用合作社订立了三连环结合合同，我社的生产、生活资料的供应和农副业产品的推销，都有了保证。社员们的学习很好，过去社里订有山西农民报、宣传手册、华北人民各一份，八月份又增订了山西日报、少年报各一份，九月份拟再订山西画报一份。社员每天上地读报，每晚还学习一小时。
    薛满泰农业生产合作社全体社员
