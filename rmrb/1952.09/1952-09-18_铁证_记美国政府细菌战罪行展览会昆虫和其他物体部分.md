    In the central exhibition room of the Exhibition of U.S. Government's Germ Warfare Crimes, there are pictures and physical objects showing the U.S. aggressors spreading insects and other objects in Korea and Northeast China. These pictures and physical objects provide irrefutable ironclad evidence of the large-scale germ warfare conducted by the U.S. aggressors in Korea and Northeast China.

    There are obvious anomalies in the seasons in which insects and spiders appeared. For example, in Northeast China: wolf spiders usually do not become active in the fields until mid-April at the earliest. However, in Benxi and Andong areas of Liaodong Province, they appeared in large numbers on the snow surface and in sub-zero temperatures. Houseflies usually do not become active until late April, but on March 17th of this year, they were found in groups on the snow surface in a mountain沟 near Siping City, Liaoxi Province. Green bottle flies usually do not appear until May, but on March 15th, they were found near the dormitory of the Northeast People's Government Trade Department in Shenyang, on a cement tennis court where the snow had not yet completely melted. Black flies, under natural conditions, should not appear in large numbers until May, but they were found in large numbers in Fushun, Kuandian, and Andong, where the ground was covered with snow. Dung flies generally do not appear until early summer, but they were found in large numbers on the snow surface in many areas of Northeast China that had been invaded by U.S. aircraft. Locusts are major pests of crops, overwintering as eggs. Adults die after laying eggs in the autumn, and the eggs hatch in May of the following year. However, in the cold climate of mid-March this year, many live locusts were found on the open-air platform on the second floor of the Northeast People's Government dormitory in Shenyang. What other explanation is there for these many anomalies other than proving that these insects and spiders were spread by artificial means by the U.S. aggressors?

    There are also many extremely abnormal facts about the places where insects appeared. For example: according to the habits of black springtails, they can be active on snow, water, and in damp places, but it is impossible for them to appear in large numbers on the six-meter-high steel and concrete grandstand of the Fushun Racecourse. At 2:00 p.m. on February 21st this year, after U.S. planes circled overhead, many black springtails landed on the hats and bodies of Xiao Dianzhen, a squad leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and his comrade Li Yusen. At about 10:00 a.m. on April 23rd this year, a large number of human fleas were found in the fields beside the mountains near Songdong, Huaiyang County, covering an area of about 300 square meters, with a dense area of about three or four square meters, where the human fleas were so numerous that they almost blackened the ground. At 4:00 a.m. that morning, a U.S. plane circled overhead, but did not drop bombs or strafe. Therefore, there can be no other explanation for these human fleas except that they were dropped by U.S. aircraft.

    At the exhibition, you can also see the sinister methods and shameless cunning of the U.S. aggressors.

    Of the spiders and various insects dropped by U.S. aircraft in Korea and Northeast China, only human fleas, houseflies, green bottle flies, and large houseflies are mentioned in general medical entomology books. Others, such as wolf spiders, black flies, black springtails, dung flies, and midges, are considered medically unimportant. Before the U.S. conducted germ warfare, no one knew that they carried anthrax bacilli, dysentery bacilli, Pasteurella, typhoid bacilli, paratyphoid bacilli, and other germs.

    In terms of containers, the U.S. aggressors also adopted various methods to conceal their crimes. For example, the four-compartment germ bomb was made to look like an ordinary 500-pound bomb, and was called a "non-explosive bomb"; the outside of the container with a parachute (containing bacteria-carrying insects, small animals, or other objects) was actually labeled as a flare. At the same time, U.S. aircraft spread insects and poisons, and for a period of time in the beginning, most of them were carried out stealthily at night, at dawn, and on cloudy and rainy days. Enemy aircraft made particularly frequent night raids in Northeast China. They vainly attempted to use the above-mentioned despicable and shameless methods to paralyze us and escape responsibility!

    What is the truth? Can the ugly face of the U.S. aggressors in conducting germ warfare be concealed by sinister cunning? Take a look at a few examples from the exhibition to find the answer.

    At 2:00 p.m. on March 9th, Zhang Anchang, a soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteers, discovered two U.S. planes in Chuannaimyeon, Munchon County, flying from the northwest, circling once, and the front plane dropped two black masses, one falling on the western hillside and the other on the eastern hillside. After the planes flew away, Zhang Anchang and eleven others simultaneously discovered a large number of flies at the places where the two black masses fell. Professor He Qi, a Chinese entomology expert, identified them as dung flies.

    On March 10th, Liu Baocheng, a platoon leader of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and soldier Wang Gang discovered small fish dropped by U.S. aircraft near Shangsongli, Daedong County, Korea. There were more than ten fish in the dry rice fields beside the road, and thirty-seven on the nearby hillside. Examination revealed that the fish carried dysentery bacilli.

    At 7:00 a.m. on March 17th, Wang Engui of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers saw four U.S. planes bombing the Gucha Station in Yangdok County. One of the planes dropped an object, which then scattered into more than ten pieces. After the planes left, large piles of flies and torn paper were found on the snow covering approximately 2,500 square meters, but not outside this area.

    At dusk on March 20th, Ren Wanku, a militiaman from Beijiaochang Village, Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province, was checking posts in the fourth group of the village and witnessed a red object the size of a thermos bottle falling. Later, a large number of specimen insects were found in an area 60 li east-west and 40 li north-south. Examination revealed that the insects carried anthrax bacilli.

    At 11:30 a.m. on March 21st, Taidong District, Taian County, Heilongjiang Province, discovered three batches of nine U.S. aircraft. Except for one plane in the second batch that did not drop feathers, the five planes in the first batch and the three planes in the third batch all scattered a large number of feathers. At that time, the Taidong District was holding a district people's conference with more than 5,400 people, so many people saw these feathers. The feathers were scattered on the roofs, fields, and meadows of seven villages, including Jubao, Zhanjiang, Changxing, Tuoli, Lianhe, Risheng, and Xianghua. There were more than ten feathers in one square meter in some places, and one or two in others.

    The fact that the U.S. aggressors conducted germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China is not only supported by ample material evidence and witness testimony, but also by the conclusive testimony of U.S. Air Force prisoners of war Inak and Quinn.

    Inak confessed that Wilson said the following while lecturing at the Iwakuni Ground School in Japan on August 25, 1951: "You can bring a bomb that looks like an ordinary bomb, but is filled with insects and bacteria. It will open after landing and release what is inside..." "You can use parachutes to drop containers containing small animals and rodents carrying bacteria and insects." "You can also drop items such as leaflets, fountain pens, clothes, food, etc., that carry bacteria." "Flies, fleas, mosquitoes, lice, and many other insects can be used to carry bacteria."

    Quinn confessed: On December 18, 1951, at the Gunsan Ground School in Korea, Ashifock said while lecturing on germ warfare: "Research has opened up an unlimited field for germ warfare..." In terms of insects, "almost any insect can be used for germ warfare. They can be selectively bred in the laboratory for many generations to make them resistant to cold and starvation."

    The confessions of Inak and Quinn are highly consistent with the materials displayed at the exhibition regarding the scattering of insects and other objects by U.S. aircraft.

    If anyone still has doubts about the fact that the U.S. aggressors conducted germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China, then please take another look at the opinion written by the first American to visit the exhibition—Reverend John Darr, Secretary of the World Peace Council—after visiting the exhibition:

        "The crime of germ warfare has been proven in this exhibition. To those who still harbor doubts about these facts and refuse to tell the facts to the people of his country, I, as the first American to visit this exhibition and a Christian pastor, am willing to say: Indeed, some Americans can commit such evils. Because for many years, until today, many Americans have persecuted people of color in extremely terrible ways. The crime of white Americans oppressing black people has been extended to people of color in Korea and China through germ warfare. The upright people of the world must quickly protest and stop this atrocity!"

    铁证
    ——记美国政府细菌战罪行展览会昆虫和其他物体部分
    新华社记者  林麟
    在美国政府细菌战罪行展览会的正中一间陈列室里，陈列着美国侵略者在朝鲜及我国东北等地撒布昆虫及其他物体的图片和实物。这些图片和实物提供了美国侵略者在朝鲜及我国东北等地大规模进行细菌战的不容抵赖的铁证。
    在昆虫和蜘蛛等出现的季节上，存在着明显的反常现象。例如，在我国东北地区：狼蛛平常最早要在四月中旬才能在田野活动，但是，在辽东省的本溪及安东地区却在雪面和零度下的气温中大量出现；家蝇须到四月下旬才开始活动，但是，在今年三月十七日却在辽西省四平市附近山沟的雪面上成群发现；绿蝇平常要到五月才能出现，但是，三月十五日却在沈阳东北人民政府贸易部宿舍附近，积雪尚未全化的洋灰网球场上发现了；黑蝇在自然情况下，应到五月才能大量出现，但是，在地面满是积雪的抚顺、宽甸和安东却大批发现了；粪蝇一般要到初夏才能出现，但是，在东北被美机侵扰过的许多地区，在雪面上却大批发现了；飞蝗是农作物大害虫，它是以卵过冬的，成虫于秋季产卵后死亡，卵于第二年五月间孵化。但是，在今年三月中旬寒冷的气候里，在沈阳市东北人民政府宿舍的二层露天平台上，却发现许多活的飞蝗。这许多反常现象，除了证明这些昆虫和蜘蛛是美国侵略者用人为的方法撒布的以外，又有什么其他的解释呢？
    在昆虫出现的场所上，也有许多极不正常的事实。例如：按黑跳虫的习性，是可以在雪地上、水面上和潮湿的地方活动的，它决不可能大量出现在抚顺市跑马场六公尺高的钢骨水泥的看台上；今年二月二十一日下午二时，在美国飞机盘旋后，许多黑跳虫竟落在中国人民志愿军某部班长肖殿珍和他的战友李玉森的帽子上和身上。今年四月二十三日上午十时左右，在淮阳郡松洞附近，山旁田地上发现了大量的人蚤，散布的面积约三百平方米，其中有一个约三、四平方米的密集地带，人蚤之多，几乎使地面发黑。当天清晨四时，曾有一架美机在该处盘旋，未投弹也未扫射。所以，这些人蚤除说明美机投下的以外，就不可能有另外解释。
    在展览会上，你还可以看到美国侵略者的阴险手段和无耻的狡猾伎俩。
    从美国飞机在朝鲜和我国东北所投下的蜘蛛和多种昆虫中，只有人蚤、家蝇、绿蝇、大家蝇是一般医学昆虫学书上提到的，其他如狼蛛、黑蝇、黑跳虫、粪蝇、摇蚊，是医学上认为没有什么重要性的，在美国进行细菌战以前，谁也不知道它们竟带有炭疽杆菌、痢疾杆菌、巴士德属杆菌、伤寒杆菌、副伤寒杆菌等病菌。
    在容器方面，美国侵略者也采用了种种掩饰罪行的办法。如把四格型的细菌弹的外表造成和普通的五百磅炸弹一样，并且称之为“不爆炸的炸弹”；把带有降落伞的容器（内装带菌昆虫、小动物或其他物体）外面，竟写成照明弹字样。同时，美国飞机撒布昆虫和毒物，在开始一个时期，大多数是在夜间、拂晓和阴雨天偷偷摸摸地进行的，在我国东北地区敌机趁夜间偷袭的次数尤多。它们竟妄图以上述种种卑鄙无耻的方法，来达到麻痹我们和逃避罪责的目的！
    事实究竟如何呢？美国侵略者进行细菌战的丑恶嘴脸是阴险狡猾所能掩盖得了的吗？看看展览会上的几个例子，就可以找到答案。
    三月九日下午二时，中国人民志愿军战士张安常在文川郡川内面，发现美国飞机二架，从西北方向飞来，盘旋一周，前边一架投下两个黑团，一个落在西面山坡，一个落在东面山坡。飞机飞走后，张安常和其他十一人在两个落黑团的地方同时发现大量的蝇子，经我国的昆虫学专家何琦教授鉴定为粪蝇。
    三月十日，中国人民志愿军某部排长刘保成及战士王刚在朝鲜大同郡上松里附近发现美机投下小鱼，路旁干稻田中有十余条，附近山坡上有三十七条，经检验发现小鱼带有痢疾杆菌。
    三月十七日上午七时，中国人民志愿军某部王恩贵在阳德郡看见美国飞机四架轰炸巨次车站，其中一架投下一物，随后散成十多个。飞机离开后，发现约在二千五百平方公尺的雪地上有大堆的蝇子和破纸片，但在这面积以外的地方就没有。
    三月二十日黄昏，辽东省辽阳县北教厂村民兵任万库，到该村四组查岗，目睹一大小如暖水瓶似的红色物体下落，后在该地东西六十华里、南北四十华里地区发现大量标本虫，该虫经检验，带有炭疽杆菌。
    三月二十一日上午十一时三十分，黑龙江省泰安县泰东区发现美机三批九架次，除第二批一架未投掷羽毛外，第一批五架和第三批三架都撒布了大量的羽毛。当时泰东区正开着五千四百多人的区民大会，所以看见这种羽毛的人很多。这羽毛散落在聚宝、沾江、长兴、托力、联合、日升和祥华等七个村的房顶、田间和草甸上。一平方公尺内，多的有十多根，少的有一、二根。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国东北等地进行细菌战的事实，不仅我们有着充分的物证、人证；从美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的供词中，也得到确凿的证明。
    伊纳克供认，威尔逊在一九五一年八月二十五日在日本岩国地面学校上课时曾这样说：“你可以带一种炸弹看起来很像普通炸弹，不过是装满了昆虫和细菌的，落地后即行开启，放出里面所装的东西来……”“你可以用降落伞投下装着带着细菌及昆虫的小动物及啮齿类动物的容器。”“你也可以丢下像传单、水笔、衣服、食物等，带有细菌的物件。”“像苍蝇、跳蚤、蚊子、虱子和其他很多昆虫都可以用来携带细菌。”
    奎恩供认：一九五一年十二月十八日在朝鲜群山地面学校，阿西福克在上细菌战的课时曾说：“研究工作已给细菌战开辟了一个无限的领域……。”在昆虫方面，“几乎任何昆虫都可以利用来进行细菌战，它们可以在实验室条件下经过多代的选择培养，使它们能够耐寒耐饿。”
    伊纳克和奎恩的供词，与展览会上陈列的美国飞机撒布昆虫和其他物体的材料是十分吻合的。
    谁如果仍然对美国侵略者在朝鲜及我国东北等地进行细菌战的事实有所怀疑的话，那么，请他再看看第一个参观展览会的美国人——世界和平理事会秘书约翰·达尔牧师在参观展览会后写的意见吧：
        “在这个展览中细菌战的罪行已经证实。那些仍然对这些事实抱怀疑态度和不肯把事实告诉他本国人民的人，我以第一个参观这个展览会的美国人和基督教牧师的身份，愿意说：的确有些美国人能犯这样的罪恶。因为多少年来，一直到今天，有很多美国人曾用极可怕的方法迫害有色人民。白色美国人压迫黑人的罪恶，已经通过细菌战而伸展到朝鲜及中国的有色人种，全世界的正直人民，要赶快抗议，制止这个暴行！”
