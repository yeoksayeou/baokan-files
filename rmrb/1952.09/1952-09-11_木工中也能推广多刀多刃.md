    Multi-Knife, Multi-Blade Tools Can Also Be Promoted in Carpentry
    Editor: Fu Xingqiao, a worker in the carpentry section of a workshop at the Northeast 604 Factory, created a double-sided, multi-blade planer with a flat center and an electric speed of 1,300 revolutions per minute, based on the principle of multi-knife, multi-blade cutting and high-speed cutting methods used in the mechanical industry. This greatly improved the efficiency of woodworking planing. For example, it used to take five minutes to make a window frame, but now it only takes twenty seconds, while guaranteeing the standard of quality. Because this planer is used for making window frames, everyone calls it the "rabbeting and chamfering planer."
    Carpenter Wang Yumin also created a multi-blade milling cutter based on the principle of multi-knife, multi-blade, high-speed cutting methods, increasing work efficiency tenfold. The emergence of these two new tools has opened up a new path for increasing production and practicing economy in carpentry. Liu Jie

    木工中也能推广多刀多刃
    编辑同志：东北六○四厂某车间木工工段工人傅兴桥，根据机械工业采用多刀多刃切削和高速切削法的原理，创造了两面多刃、当中平面的每分钟电动速度一千三百转的刨子，使木工刨木的效率大大提高。如过去做一个窗户框需要五分钟，现在只要二十秒就可以了，并保证了质量的标准。因为这个刨子是制窗子框时用的，所以大家叫它做“裁口、倒楞刨子”。
    木工王裕民，也根据多刀多刃、高速度切削法原理，创造一个多刃铣刀，提高工作效率十倍。这两个新工具的出现，给木工开辟了一条新的增产节约的道路。　刘　捷
