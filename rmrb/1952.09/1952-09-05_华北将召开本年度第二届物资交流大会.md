    North China to Hold This Year's Second Materials Exchange Conference

    The North China region's second materials exchange conference, primarily focused on promoting industrial products this year, will be held in Tianjin City starting September 25th. The conference is tentatively scheduled to last one and a half months. The Materials Exchange Work Committee has been officially established, and preparatory work is actively underway.

    With the victorious conclusion of the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements and the further development of industrial and agricultural production, the purchasing power of urban and rural people has greatly increased. To adapt to this new situation, meet the current purchasing needs of the people, and further invigorate the exchange of materials and the urban-rural economy, the conference has decided that in addition to the trade delegations organized by the five provinces and two cities of North China on a provincial and municipal basis, major regions across the country will be invited to participate in the transactions. Private industrialists and merchants, as well as small trade groups from prefectures, counties, and towns in various provinces, will also be extensively mobilized to participate in the conference.

    The tasks of this conference are: to vigorously promote industrial products, agricultural and sideline products, and local and special products, expand domestic sales, organize foreign sales, and further strengthen the planning of production and sales in the future through the mutual exchange of production and sales information between trade delegations from various regions; through this conference, the implementation of old trade contracts will be checked and their realization will be urged, in order to establish new business ideas and business styles. The conference trade will adopt the principle of buying more and selling more, large-scale purchase and sales, and will especially strengthen the supply of materials to ethnic minority areas and disaster areas, and the purchase of agricultural products, sideline products, local products, and special products, in order to promote the rapid recovery and development of production in the above areas.

    本年度以推销工业品为主的华北区第二届物资交流大会，将于九月二十五日起在天津市举行，会期暂定为一个半月。物资交流工作委员会已正式成立，筹备工作正积极进行中。
    随着伟大的“三反”“五反”运动的胜利结束和工业农业生产的进一步发展，城乡人民的购买力大大提高，为适应这种新的情况，满足人民当前的购销的需要，进一步活跃物资交流和城乡经济，大会决定除由华北五省二市组织以省、市为单位的贸易代表团，并邀请全国各大区参加交易外，将普遍动员私营工商业者及各省专区、县、镇组织小型贸易团参加大会。
    这次大会的任务是：大力推销工业品和农、副产品及土产、特产品，开展内销，组织外销，并通过各地贸易团互相交换产销情况，进一步加强今后产销的计划性；通过此次大会将检查旧贸易合同执行的情况，督促其实现，以树立新的经营思想与经营作风。大会贸易将采取多买多卖，大量购销的方针，并将特别加强对少数民族地区、灾区的物资供应和农产品、副产品、土产品、特产品的收购工作，以促进以上地区生产的迅速恢复和发展。
