    Responding to the Judicial Reform Movement, Resolutely Eradicating Old Legal Views
    All Students of the Law Department of the Renmin University of China Determined to
    Raise Their Ideological Awareness in the Judicial Reform Movement
    Editor: After the People's Daily issued the editorial "Judicial Work Must Be Thoroughly Reformed," the judicial reform movement has gradually unfolded across the country and has received the support of the people nationwide. Although this movement mainly focuses on rectifying and transforming people's judicial organs at all levels, as the People's Daily said, this "should be the common task of all departments of the state power and the people." Especially for those of us who are studying Marxist-Leninist political and legal science and are determined to dedicate ourselves to the people's judicial work, we feel particularly closely related to this movement.
    This fierce political and ideological struggle tells us that our country needs political and legal cadres with knowledge of Marxist-Leninist political and legal science even more urgently. In order to cooperate with our country's economic construction, to fight against old legal views, and to avoid the encroachment of old legal views on us, we are willing to join students from political and legal departments of universities across the country to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist political and legal science, strengthen the study of the experience of Soviet judicial work over the past thirty years, and consolidate our determination to strive for the people's judicial work for the rest of our lives, so as to make contributions to the people, the motherland, and the cause of the Party.
    We must earnestly study relevant documents in the judicial reform movement and further enhance our ideological awareness.
    All Students of the Law Department of the Renmin University of China
    Professors of Political and Legal Departments of Four Universities, Including Peking University, Determined to Eradicate Old Legal Views
    The vigorous judicial reform movement is unfolding nationwide. This movement will promote the improvement of the entire political and legal work, and also eradicate the influence of old legal views in political and legal education.
    We are political and legal educators from four universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, and Fu Jen Catholic University. Since liberation three years ago, we have been constantly transforming ourselves in theoretical studies, in many patriotic movements, especially in the practical work of land reform. After the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, we have initially drawn a line between ourselves and the corrupt ideas of the bourgeoisie. However, we have not yet deeply examined the academic thoughts that have a decisive relationship with our professional work. That is, we have never systematically and thoroughly criticized the education we received during the reactionary rule and the old legal views that have long eroded us. In the early days of liberation, although we firmly supported the Party and the government's decision to abolish the Kuomintang's "Six Codes," and abolished the parts related to the "Six Codes" in the political and legal courses, we did not realize that the abolition of the "Six Codes" did not mean the eradication of old legal views, nor did we realize the seriousness of the harm of old legal views to us. Our teaching work in the past three years, no matter how we subjectively demanded reform, has basically been dominated by old legal views, not only is the transformation of our academic thought piecemeal, theoretical detached from reality, and dogmatic, so that it cannot meet the needs of students and suit the needs of the country, but even we have intentionally or unintentionally directly poisoned students with our own old legal views, which is equivalent to harming the people's political and legal work.
    The Communist Party and the People's Government's wise call for judicial reform this time has made us realize our past mistakes and the detours we have taken in the past three years. In this judicial reform movement, we must boldly expose our wrong ideas and the harm these errors have caused to the people. We must rely on the masses and use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to dig out the roots of our wrong ideas. Only after eradicating old legal views can we do a good job in political and legal education and establish a new people's jurisprudence based on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.
    Our four universities are now undergoing departmental adjustments, and a brand-new political and legal institute will be established in the adjustments. However, the rectification of the organization must be combined with the transformation of thought. Therefore, the judicial reform movement is also the foundation for us to establish a new political and legal institute.
    We warmly support the judicial reform movement and wish the movement victory and success nationwide.

    Old Legal Views of a Professor in the Department of Law of Peking University in the Field of Criminal Law Eagerly Awaiting Criticism
    Editor: Recently, our Peking University Propaganda and Communications Agency invited Ning Hanlin, teaching assistant of the Law Department of Peking University, and students Liu Kunren, Chen Guangzhong, and Yin Weide to hold a forum on the issue of judicial reform. During the forum, everyone focused on some preliminary opinions on old legal views or related issues in the field of criminal law.
    Speaking of criminal law, everyone first thinks of a certain professor. This professor always believes that in his criminal law, wherever there are the words "Three People's Principles," replacing them with "New Democracy" is sufficient. When the Regulations on Punishment of Counterrevolutionaries were promulgated, this professor believed that counterrevolutionaries have "negligent offenders" and "intentional offenders," and "intentional offenders" are further divided into "purposeful" and "unpurposeful"; regarding the sentencing of counterrevolutionary criminals, their history is certainly a condition, but unless their history is all criminal facts, it cannot be used solely as a "sentencing standard." I also remember that when this professor talked about the essence and source of law, he described the law as a unity of "heavenly principles" and "human feelings." He also believes that Soviet criminal law adopts analogical interpretation, while Hitler's criminal law is based on legal emotions, so Soviet criminal law is "not as good as" Hitler's criminal law. He also believes that the criminal law of the Qing Dynasty and the Northern Warlords period was a "scientific product" of the past forty years. In a manuscript co-written by this professor and another professor, "A Comparison of Chinese Criminal Law and Soviet Criminal Law" (unpublished, shown to students), it is said that "Chinese criminal law" is "better" than Soviet criminal law, and the "Chinese criminal law" referred to is Chiang Kai-shek's criminal law. Obviously, the above views are all problematic and urgently need criticism.
    At this forum, everyone also briefly raised some opinions on civil law, the issue of the lawyer system, and the issue of judicial "independence."
    We believe that in the judicial reform movement, political and legal departments in major colleges and universities should launch a campaign to criticize various old legal views. One of the keys to doing this work well is that the teaching assistants and students of the political and legal departments actively and realistically express their opinions on the professors' and lecturers' lectures and the textbooks and reference books used.

    响应司法改革运动坚决肃清旧法观点
    中国人民大学法律系全体同学决心
    在司法改革运动中提高自己的思想觉悟
    编辑同志：人民日报发出“必须彻底改革司法工作”的社论以后，司法改革运动已在全国各地逐步开展，并得到全国人民的支持。虽然这一运动主要是在整顿和改造各级人民司法机关，但诚如人民日报所说，这“应该是国家政权工作的各部门和人民群众的共同任务”，特别是我们正在学习马克思列宁主义政法科学并决心献身于人民司法工作的人，尤其感到和这一运动关系的密切。
    这一场激烈的政治斗争和思想斗争告诉我们：我们国家需要具有马克思列宁主义政法科学知识的政法干部更加迫切了。为了配合我们国家的经济建设，为了和旧法观点进行斗争，为了免除旧法观点对我们的侵袭，我们愿意和全国各大学政法学系的同学一道加强马克思列宁主义政法科学的学习，加强学习苏联三十多年司法工作的经验，巩固自己终身为人民司法工作而奋斗的意志，以便对人民，对祖国，对党的事业有所贡献。
    我们一定要在司法改革运动中认真学习有关文件，进一步提高自己的思想觉悟。
    中国人民大学法律系全体同学
    北京大学等四校政法学系教授决心肃清旧法观点
    轰轰烈烈的司法改革运动正在全国范围内展开。这个运动要推动整个政法工作的改进，也要肃清旧法观点在政法教育工作中的影响。
    我们是北京、清华、燕京、辅仁四个大学的政法教育工作者。解放三年以来，我们在理论学习中，在许多爱国运动中，尤其是土地改革的实践工作中，不断地改造自己。经过了伟大的“三反”、“五反”运动，我们更和资产阶级的腐朽思想初步划清了界限。但是，对于和我们业务工作有着决定性关系的学术思想，我们还没有深入检查过。这就是：我们对于在反动派统治时期所受的教育和长期侵蚀着我们的旧法观点始终没有加以系统的和彻底的批判。解放初期，我们虽然坚决拥护党和政府废除国民党“六法”的决定，并且在政法课程中废除了有关“六法”的部分，但是我们没认识到“六法”的废除并不等于旧法观点的肃清，更没认识到旧法观点对我们毒害的严重。我们三年来的教学工作，无论主观上怎样要求改革，基本上却一直受着旧法观点的支配，不仅我们学术思想的改造是枝枝节节的，是理论脱离实际的，是教条主义的，以致不能满足学生的要求和适合国家的需要，甚至我们还有意无意地用自己的旧法观点直接毒害了学生，也等于危害了人民的政法工作。
    共产党和人民政府这次关于司法改革的英明号召，使我们认识到过去的错误和三年来所走的弯路。在这次司法改革运动中，我们要大胆暴露自己的错误思想和这些错误对人民的危害。我们要依靠群众，运用批评和自我批评的武器，来挖掘我们错误思想的根源。只有在肃清旧法观点之后，我们才能做好政法教育工作，建立起以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为基础的人民新法学。
    我们四个大学现在正进行院系调整，簇新的政法学院将在调整中建立起来。但是组织的整顿必须和思想的改造相结合。所以司法改革运动也正是我们建立新政法学院的基础。
    我们热烈地拥护司法改革运动，并预祝这个运动在全国范围的胜利和成功。

    北京大学法律系某教授在刑法学方面的旧法观点急待批判
    编辑同志：最近，我们北京大学宣传通讯社为司法改革问题，邀请北京大学法律系助教宁汉林，同学刘昆任、陈光中、殷惟德等开了一次座谈会。在座谈中，大家着重就刑法学方面的旧法观点或有关问题，提出了一些初步的意见。
    提起刑法学，大家首先想起了某教授。这位教授总认为，他的刑法学中，凡有“三民主义”字样的地方，代以“新民主主义”便可以了。惩治反革命条例公布时，这位教授认为：反革命分子有“过失犯”、“故意犯”之分，“故意犯”又分“有目的”的和“无目的”的；关于对反革命犯的科刑，其历史当然是一条件，不过，除非其历史都是犯罪事实，否则不能专以历史为“科刑标准”。还记得，这位教授在讲到法律的本质和来源时，竟把法律说成是“天理”、“人情”的统一。他又认为：苏联的刑法采取类推解释，而希特勒的刑法是根据法律感情，所以苏联的刑法“不如”希特勒的刑法。又认为：清代及北洋军阀时期的刑法，是近四十年的“科学产物”。这位教授和另外一位教授合写的“中国刑法与苏联刑法之比较”（未发表，给同学们看过）一稿中，说“中国刑法”比苏联刑法“好”，而所指“中国刑法”即蒋介石的刑法。显然，上述观点都大有问题，急待批判。
    在这个座谈会上，大家还就民法学方面、律师制度问题、司法“独立”问题简单地提了一些意见。
    我们觉得，在司法改革运动中，各大专学校的政法系科应开展对各种旧法观点的批判运动。而做好这一工作的关键之一，是政法学系的助教们、同学们积极地实事求是地对教授们、讲师们的讲义和所采用的教科书、参考书等提出意见。
