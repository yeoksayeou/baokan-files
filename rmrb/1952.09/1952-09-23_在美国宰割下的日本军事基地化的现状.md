    The Current Situation of Japan's Military Base Under the Domination of the United States
    On July 26, the United States and the Japanese Yoshida government signed the so-called agreement on providing military bases. According to this agreement, Japan is to provide the United States with 612 land military bases and facilities, 28 naval training areas and air force training areas on the sea surface, and 671 private residences occupied by the United States. In addition, there are "communication facilities," "civilian intelligence departments," and "radar bases," etc. These are only the current situation of Japan's military base under the domination of the United States. The American occupiers are insatiable, and they are not satisfied with the status quo, but also attempt to continue to increase their military bases and facilities in Japan.
    The density of these military bases and facilities is astonishing. Japan has a land area of only 369,000 square kilometers, but the American occupiers alone have as many as 612 military bases and facilities, averaging about one every 600 square kilometers. Japan has 42 prefectures, 2 fu, 1 to, and 1 do. If calculated as 46 prefectures, then there are an average of more than 13 in each prefecture. In Hiroshima Prefecture, where the atomic bomb was dropped, the United States has established 21 military bases and facilities; in Nagasaki Prefecture, there are 23. The American occupation forces have even established a large number of military bases and facilities in the urban areas of major Japanese cities. For example, there are 114 in Tokyo, 105 in Yokohama, and 26 in Kyoto.
    These military bases and facilities include: naval bases, air force bases, military training bases, bombing training bases, anti-aircraft artillery positions, barracks, shooting ranges, docks, shipyards, armories, repair shops, ammunition depots, military supply warehouses, oil depots, oil pipelines, railway stations, parking lots, military hospitals, and command posts, etc. Obviously, all of these are set up directly for the purpose of war.
    According to this so-called agreement, 300 of the 612 military bases and facilities are for "permanent" use. It is rare in history for one country to "permanently" use the seaports, airports, and other areas of another country.
    According to this so-called agreement, most of Japan's important naval ports, airports, and other strategically valuable areas are occupied by the United States. The famous naval ports of Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Ominato have become American naval bases. Japan's largest Haneda Airport, Tachikawa Airport, Kisarazu Airport, Itami Airport, and Misawa Airport have become American air force bases. Mount Fuji, which the Japanese people regard as a symbol of the Japanese nation, has also been turned into a military base by the United States. American tanks run rampant on Japanese soil, American warships conduct exercises on Japanese waters, the American air force practices bombing on Lanpo Beach outside Tokyo Port, and the American army practices shooting on the fields of Japanese farmers, in the fishing areas of fishermen, and even in the urban areas of Tokyo, Kobe, and other cities.
    These military bases and facilities directly endanger the peaceful life of the Japanese people. In order to build airports and training grounds, the United States forcibly requisitioned a large amount of land from Japanese farmers. For example, the American military base in Monbetsu-cho, along the coast of Hidaka, Hokkaido, has an area of 3,800 cho. Its establishment will cause huge losses of more than 250 million yen to 2,500 farmers and fishermen every year. In many places, American road construction machines have leveled mulberry fields, fields, and houses. During American military exercises, stray bullets often injure and kill farmers working in the fields. Moreover, according to the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement," the Japanese people will have to bear a large sum of so-called "defense burden-sharing fees" every year to build these disastrous military bases.
    These actions of the United States are a brutal infringement on Japan's territorial sovereignty, a great insult to the Japanese national self-esteem, and a sharp satire on Japan's "independence." The Japanese people strongly oppose the United States turning Japan into its military colony, and have waged heroic struggles against the American occupation authorities and the Japanese reactionary government that implement war policies.
    Japan is the main military base of the United States in the Pacific. From Japan north through the Aleutian Islands to Alaska, south through the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Vietnam to Thailand, the United States has deployed a huge military base network. The criminal American war of aggression against Korea was launched and carried out by using and relying on Japanese bases. The military baseization of Japan, like the re-militarization of Japan, poses a serious threat to the peace and security of Asia and the Pacific region, and therefore cannot but arouse the high vigilance and resolute opposition of peace-loving people in Asian and Pacific countries.

### 在美国宰割下的日本军事基地化的现状

    在美国宰割下的日本军事基地化的现状
    七月二十六日，美国与日本吉田政府签订了所谓提供军事基地的协定。根据这个协定，日本要向美国提供陆上的军事基地和军事设施六百十二处，海面上的海军训练区及空军训练区共二十八处，美国占用的个人住宅六百七十一处，此外尚有“通讯设施”、“民间情报部”及“雷达基地”等。这些还只是在美国宰割下的日本军事基地化的现状。美国占领者是贪得无厌的，它并不以现状为满足，还企图继续增加它在日本的军事基地和设施。
    这些军事基地和设施的密集程度是惊人的。日本领土面积仅三十六万九千余方公里，但是仅仅美国占领者的军事基地和设施即达六百十二处，平均约每六百方公里就有一处。日本有四十二个县，两个府、一个都、一个道，如果作为四十六个县计算，那末平均每县就有十三处以上。在曾经落过原子弹的广岛县，美国建立了二十一处军事基地和设施；在长崎县有二十三处。美国占领军甚至在日本各大都市市区内也建立了大量的军事基地和设施。例如，在东京市内有一百十四处，在横滨市内有一百零五处，在京都市内有二十六处。
    这些军事基地和设施的种类包括：海军基地、空军基地、军事演习基地、轰炸演习基地、高射炮阵地、兵营、打靶场、码头、船坞、兵工厂、修械厂、弹药库、军用品仓库、油库、输油管、火车站、停车场、军医院和司令部等。很显然，所有这些都是直接为了战争的目的而设置的。
    根据这个所谓协定，在六百十二处军事基地和设施中，有三百处是“永久”使用的。一个国家竟可以“永久”使用另一个国家的海港、飞机场以及其他地区，这是历史上罕见的。
    根据这个所谓协定，日本的重要军港、飞机场及其他具有战略价值的地区，大部为美国所占据。著名的军港横须贺、佐世保、大凑已成为美国的海军基地。日本最大的羽田飞机场、立川飞机场、木更津飞机场、伊丹飞机场、三泽飞机场等，已成为美国的空军基地。日本人民视为日本民族象征的富士山，也被美国变为军事基地。美国的战车在日本土地上横行，美国的军舰在日本海面上演习作战，美国的空军在东京港外的兰波滩岛上演习投弹，美国的陆军在日本农民的田地上、渔民的捕鱼区、甚至在东京、神户等市区内练习打靶。
    这些军事基地和设施，直接地危害了日本人民的和平生活。美国为了修建飞机场和演习场等，强迫征用日本农民的大量土地。例如，北海道日高地方沿海的门别町的美国军事基地，面积有三千八百町步。它的设立将使二千五百名农民和渔民每年遭受两亿五千万日元以上的巨大损失。在许多地方，美军的修路机铲平了桑林、田地和房舍。美军演习时，流弹常常射伤和射死在耕作中的农民。而且，根据美日“行政协定”，日本人民今后还每年都要为修建这些灾难性的军事基地而负担一大笔所谓“防卫分担费”。
    美国这些行为是对日本领土主权的横暴侵凌，是对日本民族自尊的极大污辱，是对日本“独立”的尖锐讽刺。日本人民强烈反对美国把日本变为它的军事殖民地，并对实行战争政策的美国占领当局和日本反动政府进行了英勇的斗争。
    日本是美国在太平洋上的主要军事基地。从日本向北经阿留申群岛到阿拉斯加，向南经琉球列岛、台湾、菲律宾、越南直伸到泰国，美国布置了一个庞大的军事基地网。罪恶的美国侵朝战争，就是利用和依靠日本基地而发动和进行的。日本的军事基地化，正和日本的重新军国主义化一样，给亚洲及太平洋区域的和平与安全带来严重的威胁，因此不能不引起亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平人民的高度警惕和坚决反对。
