    CCP Xiangtan County Committee's Reply Regarding the Dianwu and Other Human Rights Violations
    Editor: The "Readers' Letters" column in the August 21st People's Daily, featuring the opinions of six comrades, including Tan Hanzhang, suggesting that "Xiangtan County Magistrate Yu Dianwu and others should examine their errors in violating human rights," is very good and can educate the vast number of cadres to overcome bureaucracy. The situation is as follows: Shortly after the incident occurred, Yu Dianwu realized it was a mistake and immediately told the relevant cadres to investigate further. After the full situation was clarified, Yu Dianwu took the initiative to make a self-criticism to the relevant parties and leaders, requested punishment, and apologized to Comrade Zhao Lin, who had been detained. The leadership accepted Yu Dianwu's self-criticism and did not impose any further punishment. Comrade Zhao Lin's leadership also expressed no objection to Comrade Yu Dianwu's self-criticism. This August, during the "Three-Anti and Rectification" campaign for county and district cadres in our county, Comrade Yu Dianwu made another self-criticism at the conference, once again expressing his determination to correct his mistakes. Other relevant cadres who had made mistakes have also been dealt with separately long ago. Therefore, we believe that the handling of this incident is no longer a problem.

    中共湘潭县委员会对于殿武等侵犯人权事件的答复
    编辑同志：八月二十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊载谭汉章等六同志提出的“湘潭县县长于殿武等应检查侵犯人权的错误”的意见很好，可以教育广大干部克服官僚主义。情况是这样的：事件发生后不久，于殿武就发觉是错误了，当即告诉有关干部进一步调查。全部情况大白后，于殿武即主动向有关方面和领导方面作了检讨，自请处分，并向被扣的赵霖同志道歉。领导方面同意于殿武的检讨，不另处分。赵霖同志的领导方面对于殿武同志的检讨，也表示没有意见。今年八月里，在我县“县区干部三反整风”期间的大会上，于殿武同志又作了检讨，再次表示决心改正错误。对其他有关犯错误的干部也早已经分别作了处理。所以，我们认为对于这一事件的处理已经没有问题。  中共湖南省湘潭县委员会
