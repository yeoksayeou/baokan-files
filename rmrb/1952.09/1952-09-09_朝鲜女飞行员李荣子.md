    Korean Female Pilot Li Rongzi
    Ji Dong
    One moonlit night, a squadron of Korean People's Army Air Force bombers returned from a mission. Plane after plane landed smoothly at an airfield in northern Korea. As soon as the engines stopped, the handsome pilots emerged from the cockpits one after another. Ground crew members rushed to the female bomber pilot Li Rongzi to congratulate her and her comrades on the victory of their flight mission.
    Li Rongzi is a typical example of Korean women who fearlessly defend their country and resist the American aggressors. This twenty-one-year-old woman lost her father at a young age. With the help of relatives and friends, she barely finished elementary school and then stayed at home to help her mother support the family by sewing and washing clothes for others. At that time, under the rule of the Japanese invaders, the mother and daughter suffered humiliation and poverty. After the Soviet army liberated Korea on August 15, 1945, the mother and daughter began a new, happy life. The following spring, Li Rongzi was admitted to middle school for free. She was so happy that she shed tears and resolved to dedicate her life to the new motherland. At school, she joined the Korean Democratic Youth League, and her academic performance was the best in her class.
    In June 1950, the American aggressors launched the war of aggression against Korea, plunging Korea into a deep disaster again. To defend the happy life after the "August 15th" liberation, she resolutely joined the People's Army, determined to serve the motherland as loyally as the Soviet heroine Zoya.
    After joining the People's Army, Li Rongzi was assigned to a certain regiment as a scout. It was October, a time of fierce artillery fire, and the heroic Korean people were fighting the American aggressors in blood. Li Rongzi often disguised herself as a rural woman, risking her life to sneak into enemy areas to scout out enemy positions; sometimes, she carried a submachine gun and fought alongside male comrades. She overcame hunger, cold, and the physiological difficulties of being a woman, climbing mountains and crossing ridges to carry out her missions. She became a brave soldier.
    Once, in Hamhung, Li Rongzi witnessed American aerial bandits bombing many houses and a high school into a sea of fire. A gray-haired old woman sat on the ruins, crying her heart out. One son, two daughters, a daughter-in-law, and two young granddaughters of the old woman were killed in the enemy aircraft's two-hour bombing, leaving only her alone. Li Rongzi felt as if her heart was pierced by a knife when she saw this tragic scene, and she couldn't help but shed tears. She thought: since the outbreak of the war, how many towns and villages have been destroyed by American aerial bandits, and how many compatriots have lost their loved ones. The flames of revenge burned in her chest. She wiped away her tears and said to the affected villagers, "Don't be sad, I will avenge you!" From then on, she resolved to become an air force pilot. When she heard that young women could also learn to fly airplanes, she jumped for joy and immediately signed up to participate. Her request was approved.
    With the desire to avenge the people, Li Rongzi transferred from the infantry to aviation school. Because her heart was not strong enough, the school only allowed her to study wireless telegraphy. So she studied while seizing the time to exercise. Four months later, she not only became a skilled telegraph operator, but also very healthy. At that time, she gloriously joined the Labor Party. In May 1951, the school approved her request to learn to fly. She only had a junior high school education, and it was difficult to learn complex flying techniques. But with the encouragement of the Party and the help of her classmates, she worked hard to overcome the difficulties. At this time, she received a letter from her sister, who told her that her mother had gone missing in an indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft. After reading the letter, her hatred for the enemy made her even more determined and brave, and she studied flying even more diligently. After three months of hard work, she finally overcame many difficulties and became the top student in her class. Later, after some time of further flight training, she became a skilled pilot who could fly solo. After graduating from school, she was assigned to the bomber squadron led by the famous air force heroine Tai Shanxi as a pilot.
    The day she had been waiting for, to avenge the people in the sky, finally arrived. On June 9, 1952, she received combat orders. She wrote in her diary that day: "... Today I received combat orders for the first time. My heart was pounding with excitement, but I immediately remembered: pilots must be calm, brave, and careful at all times. I tried my best to calm my heartbeat. I'm going to avenge the people!"
    The time to depart arrived, and her comrades came up to shake hands with Li Rongzi tightly. She received encouragement from them: for the Party, for the motherland, and for the leader, she must successfully complete her mission. She turned and got on the plane, waved to her comrades, and said, "Comrades, see you when we return victoriously!" Then, the roar of the engine broke the silence of the night, and Li Rongzi flew her "Eagle" slowly into the sky...
    Li Rongzi looked down at the battling land of her motherland in the night sky: the huge transportation torrent of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies—the convoy of vehicles carrying military supplies—shone with intermittent, elusive lights. She secretly admired these resourceful and brave Chinese and Korean truck drivers, thinking, "It is very difficult for enemy aircraft to attack these bold and alert targets in the air." When she flew over the front lines, she saw the ground flashing with the fire of exploding shells and the flying tracers, where the Chinese and Korean People's Armies were fighting the enemy in blood. She couldn't help but shout in her heart: "Comrades of the People's Army and the Volunteer Army! You have worked hard, I wish you victory!"
    When Li Rongzi flew over the enemy's territory, she concentrated all her energy on the operation, carefully searching for targets on the ground. Suddenly, navigator Jin Canhua notified her that an enemy motorcade was speeding below with its headlights on. The flames of hatred immediately rushed to her heart, she pushed the control stick and dived toward the target, dropping a bomb on the foremost vehicle, and then strafed the enemy's vehicle group with machine guns. The enemy drivers were stunned, and the vehicles stopped with their lights on. Li Rongzi aimed at the vehicle lights and repeatedly strafed them. When the enemy vehicles burst into flames, Li Rongzi raised her "Eagle" into the high altitude to search for new targets.
    One day in July, I visited this brave female aerial pilot. At this time, she had already successfully completed two flight missions and received praise from her superiors. She said to me excitedly and resolutely, "This is only the beginning of revenge. In the future, I will strike the American aggressors even harder and harder!"

    朝鲜女飞行员李荣子
    纪东
    在一个月色朦胧的深夜里，朝鲜人民军空军的一队轰炸机执行任务归来，飞机一架架地在朝鲜北部某地机场上平稳地降落，引擎的声音刚一停止，英俊的飞行员们陆续地走出机舱。机场上的地勤人员涌向女轰炸机手李荣子，祝贺她和她的战友们飞行作战的胜利。
    李荣子是朝鲜妇女奋不顾身地保卫祖国、抗击美国侵略者的典型人物。这个二十一岁的女青年，在年纪很小时就丧了父亲，她在亲友帮助下勉强地读完小学以后，就留在家里，帮助母亲依靠给人家缝衣洗衣服来维持生活。那时在日寇统治下，母女二人受尽了凌辱和贫困的痛苦。一九四五年八月十五日苏联军队解放朝鲜后，母女二人才开始新的幸福的生活。第二年春天，李荣子免费升入中学读书。当时，她欢喜得流了眼泪，并决心将自己的一生献给新生的祖国。在学校里，她参加了朝鲜民主青年同盟，她的学习成绩是全班第一名。
    一九五零年六月，美国侵略者发动了侵朝战争，使朝鲜又陷入深重的灾难中。为了保卫“八一五”解放后的幸福生活，她毅然地参加了人民军，决心像苏联女英雄卓娅一样忠诚地为祖国服务。
    李荣子参加人民军后，被分配在某团当侦察兵。那正是炮火连天的十月，英勇的朝鲜人民都在血泊中和美国侵略军战斗。李荣子经常化装成农村妇女冒险潜入敌区去侦察敌情；有时背着冲锋枪和男同志一道战斗。她战胜了饥饿、寒冷和女性生理上的困难，爬山越岭去执行任务。她成了一个勇敢的战士。
    有一次，李荣子在咸兴亲眼看见美国空中强盗把许多房屋和一所高级学校炸成一片火海。有一个白发苍苍的老妈妈坐在废墟上哭得死去活来。这个老人的一个儿子、两个女儿、一个儿媳妇和两个小孙女，都在敌机二小时的轰炸中遭难了，现在只剩下了她一个人。李荣子看着这种悲惨的情形心里像刀刺一样，不禁流下了眼泪。她想：自从战争爆发以来该有多少城镇乡村被美国空中强盗毁灭了，该有多少同胞丧失了自己的亲人。复仇的火焰在她胸中燃烧着，她擦干眼泪对受难的老乡们说道：“大家不要难过，我给你们报仇！”从此，她就下决心要当一个空军驾驶员。当她听说女青年也可以学习驾驶飞机时，欣喜得跳起来，她立刻去报名参加。她的要求被批准了。
    李荣子怀着为人民复仇的心情从步兵部队转到了航空学校。因为她的心脏不够强健，校方只允许她学习无线电报务工作。于是她就一面学习，一面抓紧时间锻炼身体。四个月以后，她不仅成了一个熟练的报务员，而且身体也很健康了。那时她光荣地参加了劳动党。一九五一年五月，校方批准她学习飞行。她只有初中文化程度，要学习复杂的飞行技术是有很多困难的。但在党的鼓励和学员们的帮助下，她努力地去克服困难。这时候，她收到了姊姊的来信，姊姊告诉她：妈妈在敌机的滥炸中失踪了。她看完信，对敌人的仇恨使她更加坚定和勇敢了，她越加奋发地进行飞行学习。经过三个月的努力，她终于战胜了重重困难，成了全班中的优等生。后来，她又经过了若干时间的飞行训练，就成了能单独飞行的熟练的飞行员。她从学校里出来以后，就被分配在有名的空军女英雄太善姬中队长所率领的轰炸机队中当飞行员。
    她所等待着的在空中为人民复仇的一天终于来到了。一九五二年六月九日，她接受了战斗命令。这一天她在日记上这样写着：“……今天我第一次接受了战斗命令，我喜欢得心脏扑通扑通地跳动着，但是我马上记起：飞行员在任何时候都要沉着、勇敢、细心。我竭力使心脏的跳动平稳下来。我要去为人民复仇！”
    出发的时间到了，战友们走上来和李荣子紧紧地握手。她从他们那里得到一种鼓励：为了党、为了祖国和领袖，一定要圆满地完成任务。她转身上了飞机，向战友们挥了一下手，说道：“同志们，胜利归来时再见！”接着，马达的轰鸣声冲破了夜的寂静，李荣子驾着自己的“爱鹰”徐徐地升上了天空……。
    李荣子在夜空中俯视战斗着的祖国大地：朝中人民军队的巨大的运输洪流——载着军用物资的汽车行列正闪耀着时隐时现的、捉摸不定的灯光。她暗暗赞佩这些智勇兼备的中朝汽车司机们，她想：“敌机在空中要向这些大胆而又机警的目标攻击是十分困难的。”当她飞过战线的上空时，看见地面上正闪烁着炮弹爆炸的火光和飞窜的曳光弹，那里，朝中人民军队正在和敌人血战，她不禁地在心里喊道：“人民军和志愿军同志们！你们辛苦了，祝你们胜利！”
    李荣子当飞到敌人上空的时候就把全部精力集中在操作上，仔细地找寻着地面上的目标。忽然，领航员金灿华通知她，下面敌人的汽车队正开着大灯在疾驰。仇恨的火焰立即冲上了她的心头，她把操纵杆一推就向目标俯冲下去，把炸弹丢向最前面的一辆汽车，随即又用机关枪向着敌人的汽车群猛扫。敌人的司机吓呆了，汽车都亮着灯停了下来，李荣子就对准汽车灯光反复地扫射。当敌人的汽车烧起冲天大火的时候，李荣子将她的“爱鹰”升入高空，去找寻新的目标了。
    七月的一天，我访问了这个勇敢的空中女飞行员。这时，她已经胜利地执行了两次飞行任务，并且获得了上级的表扬。她兴奋而果断地对我说道：“这仅仅是复仇的开始，今后我将更重、更重地打击美国侵略者！”　　（新华社）
