The work of building large-scale shelterbelts in western Northeast China has made significant achievements.

This spring, provinces, cities, and counties in the afforestation area have cultivated 26,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese acres) of young forests, exceeding the original plan by 23%; the survival rate of planted trees reached 80%, and some areas reached over 90%. This is a good start to realizing the shelterbelt plan on schedule. Currently, various regions are actively preparing to afforest 62,000 hectares in the autumn. In the future, this will increase year by year, striving to complete the plan of afforesting more than 3 million hectares within ten years.

Constructing such a large-scale forest is an unprecedented feat in Chinese history. After the realization of this plan, the benefited area will reach about 200,000 square kilometers. Within the shelterbelt area, natural disasters such as wind, sand, water, and drought will be eradicated, fundamentally changing the natural conditions. At that time, the vast plains and deserts will be transformed into fertile farmland, excellent forest farms, and pastures. According to the survey of only seventeen counties and banners (the entire shelterbelt area has sixty-four counties and banners, an increase of four counties compared to the plan announced in January this year): the benefited area is more than 5.68 million hectares, excluding the area occupied by residential areas and roads, of which 1.8 million hectares are farmland, and the annual output will increase by more than 30% compared to now; additionally, 1.8 million hectares of arable land can be reclaimed; on more than 1 million hectares of forest land, timber worth more than 40 million tons of grain can be harvested annually. Party and government leading organs at all levels in the shelterbelt area attach great importance to the work of building shelterbelts. Before the start of afforestation, various regions promptly convened afforestation meetings or used people's representative conferences for specific research and deployment. Many provincial and county responsible cadres personally went deep into the field to supervise and inspect, and district and village cadres dug pits, planted, and backfilled with the people. In order to ensure the completion of the afforestation plan, the people's governments at all levels in the shelterbelt area strengthened and supplemented the forestry administrative institutions. For example, each province in the shelterbelt area has established an afforestation bureau in the shelterbelt area, and each county has established 125 afforestation stations. Most provinces and counties have also established afforestation headquarters, afforestation work teams, and inspection teams at all levels. Liaoxi and Rehe provinces have also specially organized afforestation teams. In order to enrich technical cadres, in addition to opening forestry specialized schools and forestry training courses, each province encourages the training of junior cadres in the workplace by taking on apprentices. In order to supply a large number of seedlings, each province has established 118 state-owned nurseries, with 648 hectares of seedling land, which can produce more than 45.3 million seedlings annually. At the same time, in combination with the interests of the people, various regions have mobilized the masses to cultivate 634 hectares of seedlings, which can produce more than 13.5 million seedlings annually. In addition, in order to adapt to afforestation on sand dunes and alkaline land, the Forestry Department of the Northeast People's Government has established a sand dune afforestation experimental station in Zhanggutai District, Zhangwu County, Liaoxi Province, and will establish a mechanized afforestation experimental station near Kaitong County, Heilongjiang Province, in order to carry out mechanized afforestation on the vast alkaline grassland.

    东北区西部营造防护林带有显著成绩
    东北区西部营造大规模防护林带的工作，已有显著成绩。
    今年春季，造林区各省、市、县已营造了幼林二万六千垧（每垧合十五市亩），超过原定计划的百分之二十三；植树成活率达百分之八十，有些地区达到了百分之九十以上。这是按期实现防护林带计划的良好开端。现在各地正在积极准备，计划在秋季造林六万二千垧。以后将逐年递增，争取在十年内完成全部三百多万垧造林面积的计划。
    营造这样大规模的森林，这是我国历史上的空前创举。这一计划实现后，受益面积约达二十多万平方公里。在林带区内，将根绝风、沙、水、旱等自然灾害，使自然条件根本改变。那时，辽阔的原野和沙漠，将变成肥沃的农田，优良的林场和牧场。仅据已勘测的十七个县、旗（全林带区有六十四个县、旗，较今年一月公布的计划增加四县）计算：受益面积有五百六十八万多垧，除了居住区域和道路等所占面积外，其中有一百八十万垧农田，每年产量将比现在增加百分之三十以上；还可开垦一百八十万垧耕地；在一百多万垧林地上，每年将可采伐价值四千多万吨粮食的木材。林带区的各级党、政领导机关都非常重视营造防护林带的工作。在开始造林之前，各地都及时召开了造林会议或运用人民代表会议进行具体研究和布置。许多省、县负责干部亲自深入现地进行督导和检查，区、村干部都和人民群众一起掘坑、栽植和培土。林带区各地人民政府为保证完成造林计划，加强和充实了林业行政机构。如林带区各省都在林带区设立了造林局，各县共设立了一百二十五处造林站，大部分省、县并逐级成立了造林指挥所、造林工作组和检查组等。辽西、热河两省还特地组织了造林队。为了充实技术干部，各省除开设林业专门学校和林业训练班外，并鼓励在工作中以带徒弟的方式培养初级干部。为了供应大量的苗木，各省已设立公营苗圃一百十八处，拥有苗地六百四十八垧，每年可产树苗四万五千三百多万棵。同时，各地也结合人民群众利益，发动群众育苗六百三十四垧，每年可产树苗一万三千五百多万棵。此外，为适应在沙丘和碱地上造林，东北人民政府林业部曾在辽西省彰武县章古台区设立沙丘造林试验站一处，并将在黑龙江省开通县附近设立机械化造林试验站，以便在广大的碱地草原上开展机械化造林。
