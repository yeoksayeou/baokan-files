    Editor's Note: At the material exchange conferences held in various places, state-owned trading enterprises, cooperatives, and private industrial and commercial businesses have signed many trade contracts. Most of these contracts have been fulfilled; however, a few have not. The following letters to the editor, which expose the facts of contract violations, should attract our serious attention. Breach of contract is not permissible; if one party breaches a contract, it will inevitably affect the other party's business plan, which is very detrimental to the movement of material exchange between urban and rural areas. The criticism of contract violators by the Hunan Xiangtan City Cooperative General Society and the Shanghai Dachang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative is correct. The units criticized here should seriously handle these opinions and respond in the newspaper.
    Fight Against Breach of Contract
    Why Doesn't Guangdong Province Oil Company Execute the Contract?
    Editor: Our Hunan Xiangtan City Cooperative General Society pre-sold 2,000 dan of peanuts to Guangdong Province Oil Company at the Central South China Material Exchange Conference in July this year. At that time, Comrade Chen Wen, Deputy Head of the Guangdong Delegation of the Central South China Material Exchange Conference, signed the transaction contract with our society on behalf of Guangdong Province Oil Company. The contract stipulated that 5% of the deposit would be paid within five days after the contract was signed. Because the Guangdong delegation failed to implement this provision, our society's delegates to the conference immediately requested the Hunan delegation to ask the conference to resolve it. After mediation by the conference secretariat, the other party to the transaction was given a deadline to pay the deposit, and the Guangdong delegation made a final guarantee (written guarantee), deciding to take the contract back to Guangdong and remit the deposit to our society within three days. Our society's delegates believed that after this mediation, the Guangdong delegation would definitely fulfill the contract. After returning to the society, our delegates quickly purchased all the peanuts. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong delegation and the Guangdong Province Oil Company still have not fulfilled the contract, which has greatly affected our society's purchasing and sales tasks. I believe that the Guangdong delegation and the Guangdong Province Oil Company should conduct a deep self-criticism for this breach of contract.  Zuo Jiliu
    The Northeast Trade Delegation Should Conscientiously Abide by Trade Contracts
    Editor: At the East China Material Exchange Conference this year, our (Shanghai Dachang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative) sold 2 million jin of onions to the Northeast delegation through the introduction of the Shanghai Cooperative Union's Sales Department. The contract stipulated that the onions would be delivered in six, seven, eight, and nine months. The price was set at 27,000 yuan per dan for those delivered in June, and 35,000 yuan per dan for those delivered in July, August, and September. The delivery location was the Zhenru Railway Station. Our cooperative would bear the cost of packaging and packaging materials before the onions were loaded onto the train. The train freight, loading costs, and bamboo frame costs for the onions would be borne by the Northeast transaction department, but our cooperative would pay in advance, and the other party to the transaction would remit the money to our cooperative along with the payment for the goods within three days of the goods arriving in the Northeast.
    In accordance with the contract, our cooperative began shipping goods on June 16th; by August 13th, we had delivered a total of 1,325,000 jin of onions, totaling 420,100,000 yuan, and paid 100,731,000 yuan in advance for freight and bamboo frames, totaling 527,421,000 yuan. However, to date, we have only received over 100 million yuan, which is far from the original amount. Our cooperative has reported this issue to the Shanghai Cooperative Union for assistance, and the Shanghai Cooperative Union has also contacted the Northeast Trade Department's Shanghai office several times, but to no avail. We hope that relevant authorities will urge the other party to the transaction to conscientiously implement the contract provisions. Shanghai Dachang District Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    Hebei Province Funing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Should Not Violate the Contract and Misappropriate Special Funds
    Editor: The Qinhuangdao Branch of the Hebei Province Oil Company signed a contract with the Tangshan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in early April this year to purchase peanuts on its behalf. In order to implement the contract, the Tangshan Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative convened a meeting of the directors of the subordinate county cooperatives, explaining the purchasing tasks, funds, and relevant expense income and expenditure and accounting procedures in detail. However, after the Funing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative started the purchasing business in late April, it did not report accounts in a timely manner, and even misappropriated the company's special funds for purchasing goods. By the end of July, when the purchasing business ended, the cooperative still owed the Qinhuangdao Oil Company 279 million yuan, which it could not hand over. After repeated demands, it still owes 186,820,000 yuan. This violation of the contract by the Funing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, arbitrarily misappropriating special funds, has caused great losses to the Qinhuangdao Oil Company. In addition to suggesting that the Tangshan Special District Cooperative and the local Finance and Economics Committee seriously investigate and resolve this issue, we also hope that the Funing County Supply and Marketing Cooperative will conduct a deep self-criticism and earnestly improve its work.

### 和破坏合同的行为作斗争

专栏：读者来信

    编者按：在各地所举行的物资交流大会上，国营贸易企业、合作社以及私营工商业之间，订立了许多贸易合同。这些合同绝大部分都实现了；但有少数没有实现。以下发表的几封来信所检举的违反合同的事实，应该引起我们严重的注意。破坏合同的行为是不能允许的，一方破坏合同，必将影响另一方的经营计划，它对城乡物资交流运动是非常不利的。湖南湘潭市合作总社及上海大场区供销合作社等单位对违反合同者的批评是正确的，在这里受批评的几个单位应对这些意见进行严正的处理并在报上答复。
    和破坏合同的行为作斗争
    广东省油脂公司为什么不执行合同
    编辑同志：我们湖南湘潭市合作总社在今年七月的中南区物资交流大会上，预售给广东省油脂公司花生仁二千担。当时由中南区物资交流大会广东省代表团副团长陈文同志代表广东省油脂公司与我社签订成交合同。合同规定：合同签订后五天内交定款百分之五。由于广东省代表团未能执行这一规定，我社参加大会交易代表当即提请湖南省代表团转请大会予以解决；经大会秘书处调处，由成交对方限期交款，并由广东省代表团提出最后保证（写有保证书），决定将合同带回广东后三天内，将定款汇交我社。我社代表认为经过这次调处，广东省代表团一定要履行合同了。我社代表回社后，即迅速将花生仁全部购妥。不料广东省代表团及广东省油脂公司至今仍不履行合同，使我社的收购与推销任务，受了很大影响。我认为广东省代表团及广东省油脂公司对这种破坏合同的行为应进行深刻检讨。  左纪柳
    东北贸易代表团应切实遵守交易合同
    编辑同志：我们（上海市大场区供销合作社）在今年华东物资交流大会上，由上海市合作社联合社推销科介绍，卖给东北代表团二百万斤洋葱。在签订的合同上订明洋葱分六、七、八、九四个月交清，在六月份交货者每担定价二万七千元，在七、八、九月份交货者每担三万五千元。交货地点是真茹车站。上车前洋葱的包装费、包装品统由我社负担。洋葱的火车运费和装车费、竹架费统由东北成交部门负担，但先由我社垫支，货到东北三日之内，由成交对方连同货款一并汇给我社。
    我社按照合同规定，即于六月十六日开始发货；到八月十三日，共交洋葱一百三十二万五千多斤，合计四亿二千零一十万多元，并代垫支运费、竹架费一亿零七百三十一万多元，合共五亿二千七百四十二万多元。但到目前为止，我们只收到一亿多元，与原数相差很远。我社曾报请上海市合作社联合社帮助解决这个问题，上海市合作社联合社也曾几次向东北贸易部驻沪办事处交涉，但均无结果。我们希望有关机关督促成交对方切实执行合同规定。  海市大场区供销合作社
    河北省抚宁县供销合作社不该违反合同挪用专款
    编辑同志：河北省油脂公司秦皇岛分公司今年四月初与唐山专区供销合作社订立了代购花生米的合同。唐山专区供销合作社为了贯彻合同，即召集所属各县社主任开会，把代购任务、资金及有关费用收支和报账手续，一一交代清楚。但抚宁县供销合作社从四月下旬开始代购业务以后，一直不及时报账，甚至挪用公司购货专款。七月底代购业务结束，该社还欠秦皇岛油脂公司二亿七千九百万元，无法交出，经多次催讨，现还差一亿八千六百八十二万元。抚宁县供销合作社这种违反合同，随意挪用专款的行为，给秦皇岛油脂公司造成很大损失。我们除建议唐山专区合作社和当地财政经济委员会认真检查解决这个问题外，并望抚宁县供销合作社对此进行深刻检讨，切实改进工作。  郑树锋  张秉谦
