Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 28th: The Japanese Communist Party's call to establish a national liberation democratic united front during the general election has been widely echoed among the Japanese people.

    The *Laborer* newspaper published a declaration by the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions regarding the general election. The declaration emphasized that the current election provides the Japanese people with an excellent opportunity to express their will and demands, to show their angry protest against the war and colonial policies pursued by the American imperialists and the Yoshida government, and to achieve unity for the purpose of national liberation.

    The *Metal Worker* newspaper reported that the Joint Wage Struggle Liaison Council has decided to support the candidates of the national liberation democratic united front in the general election.

    The *Laborer* newspaper reported that the Japanese Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions called on workers to unite in a patriotic national front to thwart the war plans of the imperialists and Japanese traitors, to expose all those engaged in divisive activities and spreading anti-Soviet and anti-communist slanders, and to vote for candidates who fight for the patriotic national front.

    The *Farmers' News* published an appeal by Kubota Yutaka, Chairman of the Japan Farmers Association and candidate of the National Liberation Democratic United Front. The appeal called on farmers to vote for peace fighters who are fighting against the seizure of farmers' land. Kubota Yutaka pointed out that farmers will give the warmongers a heavy blow with their votes.

    The *Akahata* newspaper reported that after the leadership of the left-wing Socialist Party rejected the Communist Party's proposal for a joint campaign in the general election, the Central Guidance Department of the Communist Party issued a statement, which stated in brief: "Even though the left-wing Socialist Party has rejected our proposal, we still believe that cooperation between the two parties is possible, because we believe that conscious members of the Socialist Party, as well as workers, farmers, intellectuals, and the national bourgeoisie, are in favor of our opinion."

    The Communist Party's proposal to the left-wing Socialist Party has received widespread support, while the methods of the left-wing Socialist Party's leadership have been sharply criticized. "Socialist News" reported that the Socialist Party Reconstruction Group fully supports the Communist Party's appeal to the left-wing Socialist Party.

    Even though the leadership of the left-wing Socialist Party refused to cooperate, in many cases, local branches, ordinary members of the Socialist Party, and various trade union organizations controlled by the left-wing Socialist Party are establishing a united front during the general election.

    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社东京二十八日讯：日本共产党提出的在大选期间建立民族解放民主统一战线的号召，已在日本人民中间得到广泛的响应。
    《劳动者》报刊载了全日本产业别工会会议发表的关于大选的宣言，这个宣言强调说，目前的选举给日本人民提供了一个最好的机会，他们可以借此来表达他们的意志和要求，表示他们对美帝国主义者及吉田政府所奉行的战争和殖民政策的愤怒抗议，并且为了谋求民族解放，达到团结的目的。
    《金属劳动者》报报道，工资共同斗争联络会已决定在大选中支持民族解放民主统一战线的候选人。
    《劳动者》报报道，世界工联日本联络事务局号召工人们在爱国的民族战线中团结起来，以挫败帝国主义者和日本卖国贼的战争计划，揭露一切从事分裂活动和散布反苏和反共谰言的人，投票选举为爱国的民族战线而斗争的候选人。
    《农民新闻》刊载了民族解放民主统一战线候选人、日本农民协会主席久保田丰的一篇呼吁。这篇呼吁要求农民们投票选举为反对夺取农民土地而斗争的和平战士。久保田丰指出，农民们将以他们的投票，给予战争贩子以沉重的打击。
    《赤旗报》报道，在左派社会党领导方面拒绝了共产党提出的在大选中联合竞选的建议后，共产党党中央指导部发表了一项声明，略称：“纵然左派社会党拒绝了我们的建议，我们仍然相信两党有合作的可能，因为我们认为，社会党中有觉悟的党员、以及工人、农民、知识分子和民族资产阶级都是赞成我们的意见的。”
    共产党向左派社会党提出的建议，得到了广泛的支持，而左派社会党领导当局的手段，则受到了尖锐的批评。“社会主义新闻”报道，社会党再建派充分支持共产党对左派社会党的呼吁。
    纵然左派社会党领导当局拒绝合作，然而在很多情况下，地方支部、社会党的普通党员以及左派社会党所控制的各工会组织，正在大选期中建立统一战线。
