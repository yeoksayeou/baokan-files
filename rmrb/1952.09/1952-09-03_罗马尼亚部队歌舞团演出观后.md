After the Romanian people gained liberation, the days of suffering left to the people by the old society are gone forever. Today, their lives are filled with happiness and joy. They can sing freely and dance to their hearts' content. Their songs and dances are the fresh juice bursting forth from the source of their happy lives.

On August 23rd, during the celebration of the eighth anniversary of Romania's liberation, we watched the wonderful song and dance program of the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble. These songs and dances conveyed the new thoughts and feelings of the Romanian people and reflected their happy new life. They sang praises of the great Stalin, praised the Soviet Red Army, and also praised our leader Comrade Mao Zedong. They sang Soviet songs and also Chinese songs. We also listened to their newly created, beautiful Romanian folk songs.

The song and dance ensemble's rich and healthy dance program received enthusiastic praise from the Chinese audience. "New Recruit Dance," "Those Deprived of Legal Protection," and "People's Bread" were all dances that we greatly enjoyed.

"New Recruit Dance" was permeated with a joyful mood from beginning to end. It handled the friendly and close relationship between new and old soldiers in the Romanian army very well. The relationship between the soldiers who had just joined the army and their families was also portrayed vividly and adorably. The soldiers' thoughts and feelings were fully expressed. They used the national dance most loved by the people to express the emotions in the hearts of the soldiers, and used the form of collective dance to arrange a welcoming meeting, portraying the typical character of the two new recruits. The spirit of optimism was a distinct feature in their dance. This kind of collective dance, which has been improved in form, is very important for the popularization of dance. From this dance, we saw the love between comrades, and the sincere, frank, brave, and lively character of the people. This dance truly expressed the new qualities of the Romanian people.

"Those Deprived of Legal Protection" depicts the Romanian people in the 19th century, unable to endure the cruel exploitation of the landlords, arming themselves, hiding in the mountains and forests, and preparing to fight heroically against the feudal forces at any time. The theme of this dance is very good, because from this theme we can see the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the Romanian people. Female peasants also participated in the struggle, and they took on the tasks of guarding and supplying in the battles. Male peasants were practicing fencing with sabers in a vigorous manner. When their leader returned, they happily went to participate in the battle. From this dance, we can see that the Romanian people were a brave and never-yielding nation in the past. Even those who were deprived of legal protection, they still had to live and fight the enemy.

"People's Bread" is a dance by Romanian collective farmers praising their happy life. Bringing this program to China for performance will give us great inspiration. In this dance, we saw the joyful emotions of the Romanian farmers and their prosperous life. In the dance, the dances of the two collective farm members were very prominent and distinct. Without a list of phenomena, the thoughts and feelings expressed through the dance movements explained that "People's Bread" is the fruit of the people's own labor.

From this musical and dance performance, we saw the Romanian people's will to love peace and freedom. This performance is a major event in Sino-Romanian cultural exchange, and it will further deepen the friendship between our two peoples.

With sincere friendship, I warmly welcome the Romanian People's Republic Army Song and Dance Ensemble to perform in our country. I wish them victory and success!

    罗马尼亚部队歌舞团演出观后
    中华全国舞蹈工作者协会副主席　吴晓邦
    在罗马尼亚人民获得解放以后，旧社会所遗留给人民的苦难的日子已经一去不返了。今天，他们的生活，充满了幸福和快乐。他们可以自由地歌唱和尽情地舞蹈，他们用歌舞来歌颂自己快乐的日子。他们的舞蹈和歌唱是从他们的幸福生活的源泉里迸发出来的鲜美的浆汁。
    在八月二十三日庆祝罗马尼亚解放八周年的时候，我们看到了罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团的精彩的歌舞节目。这些歌曲和舞蹈传达了罗马尼亚人民的新的思想和感情，反映了他们的幸福的新生活。他们歌颂伟大的斯大林，歌颂苏联红军，同时他们也歌颂我们的领袖毛泽东同志。他们唱苏联的歌，也唱中国的歌。我们并听了他们新创作的优美的罗马尼亚民间歌曲。
    歌舞团演出的丰富的健康的舞蹈节目获得了中国观众的热烈赞扬。“新兵舞”“被夺去法律保护的人”和“人民的面包”等，都是我们十分喜爱的舞蹈。
    “新兵舞”自始至终都贯串着愉快的情绪。它把罗马尼亚部队内的新战士和老战士的友好亲切的关系，处理得非常好。对于刚参军的战士和家庭的关系也表现得活泼可爱。把战士们的思想情绪充分地表达出来了。他们用人民所最喜爱的民族舞蹈表现出战士们内心的感情，用集体舞蹈的形式安排了一个迎新会，表现出两个新兵的典型的性格来。乐观主义的精神在他们的舞蹈中是鲜明的特色。像这种在形式上提高了的集体舞蹈，对于舞蹈的普及工作来说，是很重要的。从这个舞蹈内，我们看到的是同志间的爱，和真诚、坦率、勇敢、活泼的人民性格。这个舞蹈真正表现了罗马尼亚人民的新的品质。
    “被夺去法律保护的人”是表现罗马尼亚人民在十九世纪中忍受不住地主残酷的剥削，因而武装起来，隐藏在山林里随时准备着与封建势力作英勇斗争的舞蹈。这一个舞蹈的题材是非常好的，因为从这一个题材内可以看到罗马尼亚人民不屈不挠的革命精神。女的农民也参加了斗争，她们在战斗中担任了守卫和供应的任务。男的农民在生龙活虎般地练习短剑。当他们的领袖回来时，他们愉快地去参加战斗。从这一个舞蹈里，我们看出罗马尼亚人民在过去是一个勇敢的和从来不甘屈服的民族。即使是被夺去了法律保护的人们，他们也是一样地要生活下去，并与敌人战斗。
    “人民的面包”这是罗马尼亚集体农民们歌颂自己幸福生活的一个舞蹈。他们把这一个节目带到中国来献演，将给予我们很大的启发。在这一个舞蹈里，我们看到罗马尼亚农民们的欢乐情绪和他们的富裕的生活。在舞蹈内两个集体农庄庄员们的舞蹈非常突出鲜明。没有现象的罗列，是从舞蹈动作所表达出的思想感情说明了“人民的面包”是人民自己的劳动果实。
    从这次音乐和舞蹈的演出中，我们看到了罗马尼亚人民爱好和平和自由的意志，这次演出是中罗文化交流的一件大事，它将会进一步加深我们两国人民的友谊。
    我以诚挚的友谊，热烈欢迎罗马尼亚人民共和国部队歌舞团来我国演出。祝他们胜利成功！
