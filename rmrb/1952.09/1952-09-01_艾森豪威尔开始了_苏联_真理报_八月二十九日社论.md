    Eisenhower Begins...
    —Editorial from the Soviet "Pravda" on August 29th

    Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower—whom Americans call by his childhood nickname "Ike"—apparently possesses an extraordinary imagination. But we cannot say his imagination is rich. His imagination is extremely unrestrained. If his imagination is coupled with a mouth that speaks without thinking, then we have all the conditions necessary to concoct "hair-raising" myths. Eisenhower's speech to the American Legion National Convention on August 25th showed off his talent for speaking off the cuff. The American Legion is one of the most reactionary groups in the United States and has had close ties to Hitlerites in the past.

    Eisenhower, with a sweeping gesture, explained the foreign policy he intends to pursue if elected president. He made it very clear that the United States must use military force to seize a large part of Europe and bring it under American rule. Eisenhower listed the countries he wants to conquer: First, he wants to separate Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania from the Soviet Union and return them to the rule of capitalists and landlords. Second, he wants to conquer Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Albania. Third, he hopes to bring eastern Germany and eastern Austria under his control.

    On what basis does Ike's unrestrained imagination incorporate the people of all these countries into the American Empire?

    Ike announced a new discovery.

    "The people of these countries are all our blood relatives... I can most solemnly tell you that America's conscience will never be at ease until these people, who share our blood and our way of life, are restored to a society of free people." The so-called restoration to a society of free people means restoring the society of Eisenhower and his ilk, a society of man exploiting man.

    We see that Eisenhower's blood relationship is extraordinarily broad: Lithuanians and Estonians, Poles and Czechs, Hungarians and Romanians, Bulgarians and Albanians, Germans and Austrians—all are counted by Eisenhower as his "blood relatives."

    But it doesn't stop there. Ike's blood relationship even extends to the peoples of Asian countries. His "list" also includes "over five hundred million people" living in China, the Mongolian People's Republic, Indochina, and other places.

    Hitler's racial supremacists would be shocked. Their appetites were indeed large, but they never dared to count the Mongolian people, the Chinese people, and the Korean people as their "blood relatives."

    And what obstacles stand in the way of war-mongering Ike? He believes that the United States could have easily seized these countries if it were not for the Soviet Union. Therefore, war must be waged against the Soviet people! This is the inevitable conclusion drawn from his bombastic speech.

    But is the Soviet Union guilty simply because it defends peace and vigilantly protects its borders? No. If we listen to Ike's speech, we know that the Soviet Union is also guilty of: victoriously developing its national economy, striving to ultimately "surpass American productivity," and the Soviet people's "efforts are patient, resolute, and unwavering."

    What other accusations does the furious Ike heap on the Soviet Union? He says that "Soviet propaganda" is creating anti-American sentiment around the world.

    This argument, taken from the arsenal of American fascist propaganda, can only make people laugh. Eisenhower is clearly trying to shift the blame onto others. We will see below who is creating this anti-American sentiment.

    So, what exactly made Eisenhower deliver this hysterical speech? He himself provided the answer when talking about the psychology of fear.

    He fabricated a ridiculous picture of some kind of "Soviet aggression" in front of the audience, insisting that the United States is facing the greatest danger in history today, to scare his audience.

    We believe that Eisenhower has not yet developed to the point of former US Secretary of Defense Forrestal, but he has imitated Forrestal's posture before jumping out of the madhouse window with remarkable fidelity.

    But all this is not new. Hitler also used the psychology of fear. He also said he wanted to "liberate" the people of other countries. He styled himself as a new Napoleon. But in reality, as Comrade Stalin said, Hitler resembled Napoleon as much as a kitten resembles a lion.

    The impression that Eisenhower's speech made on the bourgeoisie of Western Europe and the partners of the North Atlantic Alliance—the target audience of this speech—is very interesting.

    The French reactionary newspaper "Le Monde" could not hide its dismay, saying: "General Eisenhower's speech confirms the fears of many Europeans… This speech caused panic."

    The British "Daily Mirror" said it was a strange speech. The "Scotsman" asked: Was this speech wise? Then answered itself: unwise. The "Manchester Guardian" sadly said: You see, Eisenhower has confirmed the belief of peace advocates: Western countries are preparing for a war of aggression.

    Just before Eisenhower delivered this speech, even a lackey of American imperialism like former French Prime Minister Bidault warned his overseas friends: Shut up! Bidault wrote: The United States is too "loose-tongued," and said that "expressing opinions in a harmful, clamorous way" is due to disagreements within the North Atlantic Alliance. Bidault said that the French are "tired of the superficiality of a large part of anti-Russian propaganda. They are also tired of always depicting the monster of the Russian threat." According to Bidault, the French are not afraid of the Russians, but afraid of the Americans.

    The British "Daily Express" published news from New York that Eisenhower's loose-tongued remarks this time caused panic among American voters.

    The people of all countries do not want war, and the governments of capitalist countries are trying to shirk the blame for their preparation of another war. Eisenhower's imagination is unrestrained. But his arms are too short. He envisions fighting with the hands of American puppet states, of course, but it is one thing to talk about blood ties and kinship, and quite another to sacrifice one's relatives and shed one's blood for the benefit of American bankers.

    The Russian people once sang a humorous song ridiculing a very bellicose British strategist:

    Lord Palmerston
    Wants to fight so badly
    Smashes Russia on the map
    With only his index finger as a weapon

    Eisenhower's index finger, outwardly, looks very resolute and frightening. But the effect is quite laughable. This American general arrogantly says: "We must tell the Soviets with a cold, resolute attitude..." People cannot help but advise him first: Drink a glass of cold water, Ike! Wake up. What kind of cold, resolute attitude is this? This is hysterical boasting.

    This presidential candidate says that he wants to conquer half the world and enslave hundreds of millions of people, while his friend, Vice President candidate Nixon, answering the magazine "U.S. News & World Report" about whether the Korean War is going well, said that the Korean War is not going well and the United States can no longer force Korea to accept a military settlement.

    But Eisenhower brags that with the help of the armies of France, Belgium, and other countries, he wants to force the free people of Europe and Asia to accept a military settlement, and he wants to force the Soviet people to accept a military settlement. Well-behaved Belgian soldiers have already shown that American adventurers cannot expect Belgian soldiers to help them carry out crazy plans. The French newspaper "Combat" called the Belgian incident "the first mutiny in Europe" against the violent pressure of the United States.

    Eisenhower complains sadly that "anti-American sentiment" is spreading in Europe. This is an undeniable fact. Even all capitalist newspapers admit this. Eisenhower attributes this to Soviet propaganda. But without a doubt, on August 25th, Eisenhower's own speech spread more anti-American propaganda than hundreds of articles in Soviet newspapers could spread in a month. Eisenhower deserves the title: the most enthusiastic propagandist for inciting hatred, contempt, and hostility towards war-mongers—American aggressors.

    As for Eisenhower's intimidation of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people will only laugh it off, just as they did with Hitler's intimidation in the past. It is said that the policy of intimidation is the weapon of the weak against the timid. Well, if General Eisenhower likes the policy of intimidation very much, let him go and intimidate the crows in the vegetable garden.

    艾森豪威尔开始了……
    ——苏联“真理报”八月二十九日社论
    共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔——美国人用他幼时的浑名“艾克”称呼他——显然具有异乎寻常的想像力。但是我们不能说他的想像力是丰富的。他的想像力是非常放纵不羁的。如果他的想像力加上信口开河的一张嘴，那么我们就具备了编制“毛骨悚然”的神话的一切条件了。艾森豪威尔八月二十五日在美国退伍军人团全国代表大会上发表的演说便以他的信口雌黄的才能大露锋芒。美国退伍军人团是美国最反动的团体之一，它在过去与希特勒分子有密切的联系。
    艾森豪威尔以大刀阔斧的手法说明了如果他当选总统后准备奉行的外交政策。他使人很清楚地了解：美国必须以军事力量夺回一大部分的欧洲，归美国统治。艾森豪威尔列举了他要征服的国家：第一，他想把拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚与立陶宛割离苏联，重归于资本家与地主统治之下。第二，他想征服波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和阿尔巴尼亚。第三，他希望把德国东部与奥地利东部置于他的控制之下。
    艾克的放纵不羁的想像力是根据什么理由把所有这些国家的人民并入美利坚帝国呢？
    艾克宣布了一个新发现。
    “这些国家的人民都是我们的血亲……我可以最庄严地告诉你们，在这些和我们具有同一血统和同
    一生活方式的人民恢复自由人的社会之前，美国的良心是永远不安的。”所谓恢复自由人的社会，就是要恢复艾森豪威尔及其一伙的社会，恢复人剥削人的社会。
    我们看到，艾森豪威尔的血亲关系异常广泛：立陶宛人和爱沙尼亚人，波兰人和捷克人，匈牙利人和罗马尼亚人，保加利亚人和阿尔巴尼亚人，德国人和奥地利人——统统都被艾森豪威尔算成是他的“血亲”。
    但是，事情还不仅如此。艾克的血亲关系竟然还及于亚洲各国人民。他的“名单”中还有生活在中国、蒙古人民共和国、印度支那等地的“五亿以上的人口”。
    希特勒种族优越主义者一定会大惊失色。他们的胃口的确很大，但他们还不敢把蒙古人民、中国人民和朝鲜人民算作是他们的“血亲”。
    而好战成性的艾克的道路上又有什么障碍呢？他认为，如果不是因为苏联的话，美国原可以很容易地攫夺到这些国家的。因此，必须对苏联人民发动战争！这就是从他的大言不惭的演说中得出的必然结论。
    可是，苏联的罪状就只是因为它捍卫和平和警惕地保护自己的边疆吗？不是的。如果我们听听艾克的演说，我们就知道苏联的罪状还有：胜利地发展自己的国民经济，努力最后要“超过美国的生产力”，苏联人民“的努力是耐心、坚决而坚持不渝的”。
    愤怒的艾克加在苏联头上的罪状还有什么呢？他说，“苏联宣传”在全世界制造了仇美情绪。
    这种从美国法西斯宣传武库中拿出的论据只能使人发笑。艾森豪威尔显然企图嫁祸于人。我们在下面就会知道究竟谁在制造这种仇美情绪。
    那么，究竟是什么东西使艾森豪威尔发表这篇歇斯底里的演说呢？他自己在谈到恐惧心理时提供了答案。
    他在听众面前无中生有地描绘了一幅某种“苏联侵略”的荒唐图画，硬说美国今天面对着历史上最大的危险，以此来吓唬他的听众。
    我们认为，艾森豪威尔还没有发展到故美国国防部长福莱斯特尔的地步，但是福莱斯特尔还没有在疯人院跳窗以前的姿态，他却已模仿得维妙维肖。
    可是这一切并不新鲜。希特勒也曾利用恐惧心理。他也说他要“解放”其他国家人民。他自命为新的拿破仑。但实际上，正如斯大林同志所说，希特勒之像拿破仑，犹如小猫之像狮子。
    艾森豪威尔的演说在西欧的资产阶级人士、北大西洋同盟的伙伴们——这篇演说的对象——中间所造成的印象，是很有兴味的。
    法国反动报纸“世界报”掩饰不住惊恐的心情说：“艾森豪威尔将军的演说证实了许多欧洲人的恐惧。……这篇演说引起了惊慌。”
    英国“每日镜报”说这是一篇奇怪的演说。“苏格兰人报”问道：这篇演说明智吗？然后自己答道：不明智。“曼彻斯特卫报”哀伤地说：你看见没有，艾森豪威尔证实了和平拥护者的信念：西方国家正在准备侵略战争。
    就在艾森豪威尔发表这篇演说以前不久，像法国前总理皮杜尔这样忠于美帝国主义的奴才，也曾经警告他的海外朋友说：住嘴吧！皮杜尔写道：美国太“信口开河”了，并说：“用有害的叫嚣方式发表意见”是由于北大西洋同盟中间的意见分歧。皮杜尔说：法国人“对于很大一部分反俄宣传的肤浅，已经感觉厌倦了。他们也同样厌倦了总在描绘俄国威胁这个怪物”。据皮杜尔说，法国人不怕俄国人，但怕美国人。
    英国“每日快报”刊载纽约的消息说：艾森豪威尔这一次信口开河的言论，引起了美国选民的惊慌。
    各国人民不要战争，资本主义各国的政府正在设法推卸他们准备另一次战争的罪责。艾森豪威尔的想像力是放纵不羁的。可是他的两只手短了一些。他设想的当然是假美国仆从国家的手去打仗，可是，空谈甚么血缘和亲族是一回事，为了美国银行家的利益而牺牲自己的亲族和洒出自己的鲜血却完全是另外一回事。
    俄国人民曾经唱过一支嘲笑一个极度好战的英国战略家的幽默的歌：
    大将军巴尔莫斯顿
    要想打仗好心焦
    在地图上捣破了俄罗斯
    武器只有那食指一条
    艾森豪威尔的食指，外表上看起来是很坚决而怕人的。但效果却十分可笑。这位美国大将军趾高气扬地说：“我们必须以冷酷的坚决的态度告诉苏联人……。”人们不禁要首先劝告他：喝一杯冷水，艾克！醒醒吧。这是什么一种冷酷的坚决的态度呀？这是歇斯底里的吹牛。
    这位总统候选人说，他要征服半个世界，奴役亿万人民，而他的朋友、副总统候选人尼克松在回答“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志关于朝鲜战争是否顺利的问题时却说，朝鲜战争并不顺利，美国已不再能强迫朝鲜接受一个军事定局。
    可是艾森豪威尔却吹牛说，在法国、比利时与其他国家军队的帮助下，他要强迫欧亚两洲自由人民接受一个军事定局，他要强迫苏联人民接受一个军事定局。安份守己的比利时兵士已经表明，美国冒险家不能指望比利时兵士帮助他们实行疯狂的计划。法国报纸“战斗报”把比利时事件叫做反抗美国的强暴压力的“欧洲第一个哗变”。
    艾森豪威尔十分悲哀地抱怨说，“仇美情绪”正在欧洲蔓延。这是无可争辩的事实。连全体资本主义报纸都承认这一点。艾森豪威尔把这归咎于苏联的宣传。但是毫无疑问，在八月二十五日那一天，艾森豪威尔用自己的演说散布的反美宣传，比苏联报纸上在一个月内几百篇文章所能散布的还要多。艾森豪威尔当得上这样的称号：鼓动仇视、蔑视和敌视战争贩子——美国侵略者的最热心的宣传家。
    至于艾森豪威尔对苏联的恫吓，苏联人民只会一笑置之，正如他们过去对希特勒的恫吓一样。有人说，恫吓政策是弱者对付胆小的人的武器。那末，如果艾森豪威尔将军非常喜欢恐吓政策的话，就让他去恐吓菜园里的乌鸦吧。
