Xinhua News Agency, September 11th: According to TASS, the US House Un-American Activities Committee, established specifically to persecute American progressives, recently suffered a major defeat at the hands of courageous Chicago union members. The committee was forced to end its planned two-week investigation and leave Chicago.

　　The Un-American Activities Committee arrived in Chicago not long ago in its usual hysterical manner, "investigating" a so-called case of "Communist infiltration" into important defense industries. The first "surprise" the committee encountered was a picket line set up by many representatives of the 30,000 workers of the American Farm Implement Company who are currently on strike, in order to demonstrate. Demonstrators surrounded the Federal Building, where the Un-American Activities Committee was conducting its investigation, effectively hindering the investigation. Participants in the demonstration accused the Un-American Activities Committee of acting as strike breakers for the American Farm Implement Company.

　　Three strike leaders, including Oaks, the president of the United Farm Equipment Workers Union, demanded the right to disregard subpoenas from the Un-American Activities Committee, arguing that they had to be at strike headquarters. The Un-American Activities Committee hypocritically tried to deny its purpose of disrupting the strike and was forced to helplessly "forgive" the absence of Oaks and other strike leaders.

　　Meanwhile, branch leaders of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, the United Farm Equipment Workers Union, and the United Packinghouse Workers of America also resisted the Un-American Activities Committee. They not only refused to answer the provocative questions raised by the committee, but also questioned the committee's right to conduct investigations and why the committee never investigated "un-American war-profiteering companies."

　　Bernard, the branch leader of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America and former Congressman from Minnesota, sharply exposed the true purpose of the Un-American Activities Committee. Bernard challenged Committee Chairman Wood and other members, saying, "Compare your records in Congress with my record."

　　In response to the question of which side he sympathized with in the Korean War—the "United Nations" or North Korea—Bernard said, "I sympathize with the people who are being massacred in Korea. Let's stop this bloody tragedy in Korea right now."

　　The "Chicago Sun-Times" reported an incident that occurred during the Un-American Activities Committee's investigation. It said: "Devinaugh, a lawyer for the Un-American Activities Committee, asked Bernard for his opinion on the Taft-Hartley Act. However, when talking about the Taft-Hartley Act, Devinaugh made a slip of the tongue, saying "Taft-Hitler Act," causing the audience to burst into laughter. Bernard said: "Even here, the truth sometimes appears."

　　According to the New York "Daily Worker," the Chicago workers' aversion and hatred for the Un-American Activities Committee is growing daily. Due to the workers' counterattack, the committee has hurriedly left Chicago.

    芝加哥工人英勇斗争
    击败非美活动调查委员会的阴谋
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社讯：专为迫害美国进步人士而设的美国众议院非美活动调查委员会，最近在英勇的芝加哥工会会员手中遭到了一次重大的失败。该委员会被迫结束了原定延续两周的调查会而离开了芝加哥。
    非美活动调查委员会不久以前以它常有的歇斯底里的姿态来到芝加哥，“调查”一个所谓“共产党打入”重要国防工业的案件。该委员会遭到的第一个“意外”是美国农具公司目前正在罢工的三万工人的许多代表为了示威而布置的一条纠察线。示威者包围了非美活动调查委员会进行调查的地点——联邦大厦，实际上阻挠了调查会的进行。参加示威的人斥责非美活动调查委员会充当美国农具公司的罢工破坏者。
    包括联合农具工会主席欧克斯在内的三个罢工领袖，要求给予不理睬非美活动委员会传票的权利，理由是他们必须到罢工指挥部去。非美活动调查委员会伪善地试图否认其破坏罢工的目的，被迫无可奈何地“原谅”了欧克斯及其他罢工领袖的缺席。
    同时，联合电气及无线电工人工会、联合农具工会与联合屠宰工人工会的分会领袖也反抗非美活动调查委员会，他们不仅拒绝答复该委员会所提出的挑拨性问题，并且质问委员会有什么权利进行调查，为什么委员会从来不调查“非美国的发战争财的公司”。
    联合电气及无线电工人工会分会领袖、前明尼苏达州国会议员勃纳德，非常尖锐地揭发非美活动调查委员会的真正目的。勃纳德向该委员会主席伍德及其他委员挑战说：“把你们在国会里的纪录拿来和我的纪录比一比吧。”
    勃纳德在答复他同情朝鲜战争中的那一边——“联合国”，还是北朝鲜——时，他说：“我同情在朝鲜被屠杀的人们。让我们现在就制止朝鲜这个流血惨剧吧。”
    “芝加哥太阳时报”报道非美活动调查委员会在调查时发生的一个事件。说：“非美活动调查委员会的律师戴文纳曾问勃纳德对塔夫脱—哈特莱法案的看法。但是，在谈到塔夫脱—哈特莱法案时，戴文纳说走了嘴，说成了“塔夫脱—希特勒法案”，引起听众的哄堂大笑。勃纳德说：“即使在这里，真理有时也会出现。”
    据纽约“工人日报”报道：芝加哥工人对非美活动调查委员会的厌恶与憎恨正在日益增长。该委员会由于工人的反击，已急急忙忙地离开了芝加哥。
