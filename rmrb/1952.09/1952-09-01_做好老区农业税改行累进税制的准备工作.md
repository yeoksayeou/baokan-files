Prepare for the Implementation of Progressive Agricultural Tax System in Old Liberated Areas
Deputy Director of the Agricultural Tax Department, Ministry of Finance, Central Government  Peng Xiaofan

    After the land reform in the old liberated areas, land was largely distributed equally, and the income of various classes in the countryside was roughly similar. However, agricultural productivity had not yet improved. At that time, in order to ensure the supply for the Liberation War and strive for the rapid recovery and development of rural production, a proportional tax system was implemented for agricultural taxes. The proportional tax system fully conformed to the actual situation at that time, and this measure was correct.

    However, after several years of production campaigns, the rural economic situation in the old liberated areas has changed, and the income of various classes in the countryside has shown an imbalance. The proportional tax system has only one tax rate. Under these circumstances, it cannot fully adapt to the affordability of each class. As a result, some farmers with lower incomes bear a heavier burden, while others with higher incomes bear a lighter burden. This is very unreasonable and affects the continued development of production. In order to implement the policy of reasonable burden, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government stipulated in the "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Collection Work in 1952," promulgated on June 16, that the old liberated areas should prepare to implement a progressive tax system next year. This is entirely correct.

    Implementing a reasonable burden is the basic principle of agricultural tax policy and the universal demand of the peasant masses. In 1951, the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government sent three working groups to Northeast China, Hebei, and Henan to conduct typical surveys in several villages and solicit the opinions of the peasant masses on implementing a progressive tax system. The peasants all supported the progressive tax law. Some said, "Implementing a progressive tax means that those with more income should pay more, and those with less income should pay less. This is fairer and more reasonable; public grain will also be delivered quickly and securely." Some said, "In the long run, it's better to implement a progressive tax; otherwise, land will accumulate again!"

    In order to implement a progressive tax system, various preparatory works must be done well. The Government Administration Council's instructions clearly stipulate: "This year, we should start to do well in investigation and research, typical experiments, and all necessary preparatory work." Without sufficient preparation, the work of implementing a progressive tax system cannot be carried out smoothly.

    First, we must do a good job in investigation and research and typical experiments this year. Without thorough investigation and research, the implementation of a progressive tax system will be divorced from reality. Last year's investigation solved the question of "whether to reform the system"; this year's investigation should be to solve the question of "how to reform the system," that is, to solve the question of how to formulate a new tax system plan. Therefore, the content of this year's investigation and research should focus on understanding the actual income and expenditure of farmers of various classes and the distribution and concentration of wealth. Without understanding these situations, it will be impossible to formulate a fair and reasonable tax rate plan that adapts to both the needs of the national treasury and the affordability of farmers of all classes. We should formulate a new tax system plan based on typical survey materials and calculate the tax amount of farm households in typical villages for trial purposes, soliciting the opinions of the masses. Then, absorb the opinions of the masses and appropriately revise the established plan to make it more in line with reality, so that it can be implemented more smoothly among the masses in the future.

    The work of investigation and research and typical experiments must be carried out with leadership and planning in order to be truly effective. The finance departments (bureaus) of the large administrative regions must be responsible for leading this work, selecting several typical locations, and allocating manpower from the relevant departments of the large administrative regions and provinces to conduct investigations and experiments separately. After the investigation and experiment are completed, a summary should be made, and then, based on the summary, the entire specific method for implementing the progressive tax system should be finalized.

    Secondly, we must do a good job in propaganda and education, that is to say, we must do a good job in ideological preparation for the implementation of a progressive tax system. At present, some peasants and even some cadres in the old liberated areas still have some concerns and incorrect views about the progressive tax system.

    Some people are afraid that the burden will generally increase after the implementation of a progressive tax. This is a misunderstanding. It should be explained to these people that after the implementation of a progressive tax system, only some farmers with more income and a lighter burden may increase their burden; while farmers with less income will have their burden reduced. Such an adjustment is completely reasonable and is precisely the main purpose of implementing a progressive tax system. Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "On Policy" that in terms of tax policy, "the amount of tax paid must be stipulated according to the amount of income." The progressive tax is precisely in line with this principle. At the same time, it should be explained to these people that the progressive tax system to be implemented in the old liberated areas is different from the "unified progressive tax" during the Anti-Japanese War. The "unified progressive tax" during the Anti-Japanese War included income other than agricultural tax. At that time, land reform had not yet been implemented, and the progression of tax rates was also higher and faster; the progressive tax system now implemented only taxes agricultural income, and because the landlord class no longer exists, the progression of tax rates is also relatively slow. Farmers with more income may increase their burden, but this increase is limited. Last year, when the Hebei Working Group of the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government conducted a survey in Beizhoujia Village, Shulu County, Hebei, many farmers reflected: "When I first heard about the progression, I was very scared, but after calculating it carefully, I realized that the progression was not much." This shows that as long as the progressive tax is explained clearly to the farmers, their concerns can be relieved.

    Some people say: Implementing a progressive tax will affect the enthusiasm of advanced producers. This idea is also a misunderstanding. First of all, it should be explained to them that agricultural tax is calculated and levied according to the normal annual yield of the land, not according to the actual yield. If more grain is harvested due to intensive cultivation, more fertilizer application, and improved soil quality, exceeding the normal annual yield, it is still calculated and levied according to the normal annual yield, and the burden is not increased. Adopting this calculation method will inevitably stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production. Because after the implementation of this method, those who increase the yield per unit area will have their burden relatively reduced, and farmers understand this principle. The newly liberated areas have always implemented a progressive tax system. Over the past two years, the level of agricultural production has continued to rise, and farmers' production enthusiasm has continued to increase. Many model farmers with high yields have emerged. This is an example that the progressive tax system will not affect farmers' enthusiasm for production.

    Some people say: "The progressive tax procedure is too troublesome and difficult to implement." It should be explained to these people that the "full-amount progressive" method to be implemented in the old liberated areas is slightly more troublesome than the proportional tax in procedure, but as long as you study hard, it is not difficult to learn. Many farmers in the newly liberated areas have already been able to calculate their own tax amounts. As long as the specific content of the progressive tax system is explained clearly and in-depth propaganda and education are carried out, the masses in the old liberated areas will find it easier to learn this calculation method.

    The departments in charge of agricultural tax at all levels of government should do all the preparatory work and strive to realize the Government Administration Council's decision on implementing a progressive agricultural tax system in the old liberated areas.

    做好老区农业税改行累进税制的准备工作
    中央财政部农业税司副司长  彭晓帆
    老解放区在土地改革后，土地大体平分，农村各阶层的收入大致接近，但农业生产力还未提高，当时为了保证解放战争的供给，争取农村生产的迅速恢复和发展，在农业税方面，实行了比例税制。比例税制完全符合当时的实际情况，这种措施是正确的。
    但是，经过几年生产运动，老解放区的农村经济情况，已经发生了变化，农村各阶层的收入已经表现了不平衡的现象。比例税制只有一个税率，在这种情况下，它就不能完全适应各阶层的负担能力了。于是出现了一部分收入较少的农户负担较重，而另一部分收入较多的农户负担较轻的现象，这是很不合理的，是影响生产继续发展的。为了贯彻合理负担政策，中央人民政府政务院在六月十六日公布的“关于一九五二年农业税收工作的指示”中规定老解放区准备在明年改行累进税制，这是完全正确的。
    实行合理负担，是农业税收政策的基本原则，也是农民群众的普遍要求。一九五一年中央人民政府财政部曾派出三个工作组，分别到东北、河北及河南等地，作了几个乡村的典型调查，征询农民群众对改行累进税制的意见。农民都拥护累进税法。有的说：“实行累进税，收入多的多出一点，收入少的少出一点，这样更公平合理；公粮也交得快，拿得稳。”有的说：“从长远看，还是实行累进税好，要不，以后土地就会集疙瘩了！”
    为了实行累进税制，必须作好各种准备工作。政务院的指示中明确规定：“今年即应着手做好调查研究、典型试验和各项必要的准备工作。”没有充分的准备，改行累进税制的工作是不可能顺利开展的。
    首先，我们必须在今年做好调查研究和典型试验。如果没有周密的调查研究，改行累进税制就会脱离实际。去年的调查解决了“应否改制”的问题；今年的调查应当是解决“如何改制”的问题，即解决如何拟订新的税制方案的问题。因此，今年进行调查研究的内容，应当着重于了解各阶层农民的实际收支情况和富力的分散与集中情况。不了解这些情况，便不可能订出公平合理的、既适应国家财政的需要又适应各阶层农民负担能力的税率方案。应该根据典型调查材料，订出新的税制方案，并将典型村的农户的税额试算出来，征求群众的意见。然后吸收群众的意见，适当地修改既定的方案，使其更符合实际，以便将来能够更顺利地在群众中贯彻执行。
    调查研究与典型试验的工作，必须是有领导、有计划地进行，才有可能真正作好。大行政区财政部（局）必须负责领导这个工作，选定若干典型地点，配备大行政区及省的有关部门的人力，分头进行调查及试验。调查及试验结束以后，要作出总结，再根据总结，最后订出改行累进税制的整套具体办法。
    其次，必须做好宣传教育工作，也就是说，必须做好改行累进税制的思想准备工作。目前，老解放区的部分农民，甚至部分干部，对累进税制还存在若
    干的顾虑和错误的看法。
    有的人害怕改行累进税后，负担会普遍加重。这是一种误解。应当对这些人说明，改行累进税制以后，只有收入多而负担较轻的部分农户，可能增加一些负担；而收入少的农户，则会减轻一些负担。这样的调整是完全合理的，也正是改行累进税制的主要目的。毛主席在“论政策”一文中指出，在税收政策方面，“必须按收入多少规定纳税多少”。累进税正是符合这一原则的。同时，应当向这些人说明，老解放区将要实行的累进税制，有别于抗日战争时期的“统一累进税”。抗日战争时期的“统一累进税”，是包括了农业税以外的收入，那时还没有实行土地改革，税率的累进亦较高较快；现在实行的累进税制，只是就农业收入征税，并因地主阶级已不存在，税率的累进也比较缓慢了，收入较多的农户，可能增加一些负担，但这种增加是有限的。去年中央财政部河北工作组在河北束鹿县北周家庄进行调查时，不少农民反映：“刚一听说累进，可把人吓了一跳，后来细算了一下，才知道累进并不多。”这说明了只要把累进税向农民交代清楚，便可以解除他们的顾虑。
    有的人说：实行累进税，会影响先进生产者的积极性。这种想法也是一种误会。首先应当向他们说明：农业税是按照土地的常年应产量计征，而不是按照实产量计征的。凡由于精耕细作，多施肥料，改良土质等原因而多打了粮食，超过常年应产量的，仍按常年应产量计征，并不增加负担。采用了这种计征办法，必然会刺激农民的生产积极性。因为实行这种办法之后，凡是提高了单位面积产量的，其负担便会相对地减轻，农民是懂得这个道理的。晚解放区一直实行累进税制，两年来农业生产的水平不断上升，农民的生产情绪不断高涨，并涌出不少丰产模范，这就是累进税制不会影响农民的生产积极性的实例。
    有的人说：“累进税手续太麻烦，不易实行。”应当向这些人说明，老解放区将要实行的“全额累进”的办法，手续虽较比例税麻烦一些，但是只要努力学习，是不难学会的。晚解放区的许多农户已经能够自己计算税额了，只要把累进税制的具体内容解说清楚，并进行深入的宣传教育，老解放区的群众更容易学会这种计算办法。
    各级政府主管农业税的部门，应做好一切准备工作，为实现政务院关于老解放区农业税改行累进税制的决定而努力。
