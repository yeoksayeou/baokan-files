Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: After the incident of Republican Vice Presidential candidate Nixon accepting subsidies from wealthy businessmen was revealed, Wall Street's politicians from both parties discarded their gentlemanly disguise and further exposed each other's various secrets of corruption and illegality, launching an extremely ugly quarrel. This fierce infighting between the two parties has stirred up the unspeakable filth in American political circles.

The Democratic Party, attempting to use the Nixon incident to increase its own campaign capital, continued to pursue Nixon. On the 21st, Pennsylvania Democratic Congressman Eberharter issued an open letter to the press, raising new clues to Nixon's corruption and bribery. Eberharter questioned Nixon about where he got the money to buy a $41,000 house in the most luxurious area of Washington, "Spring Valley," eight months after being elected as a California Senator. Eberharter said: The first payment to purchase this house could not be afforded by a senator's annual salary. The facts show that before Nixon was elected senator in 1950, he originally lived in a two-bedroom apartment with a monthly rent of 92 yuan. With the scandal exposed and unable to face the public, Nixon fell into an extremely unfavorable situation. Even two influential newspapers supporting the Republican campaign, the "New York Herald Tribune" and the "Washington Post," asked Nixon to give up his candidacy for Vice President. The "Washington Post" said: "Senator Nixon's behavior disqualifies him from running." The heavy blows Nixon received left him very embarrassed. According to a United Press dispatch from Washington on the 22nd, when Nixon left Portland for Los Angeles, he was "pale and haggard." On the 24th, Nixon flew to Wheeling, West Virginia, to meet with Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower. Agence France-Presse described the dramatic scene of the two meeting: "Nixon met Eisenhower in the plane after arriving here by plane. They both cried when they met..."

However, the Republican politicians, disregarding the exposure of Nixon's corruption scandal, decided to continue to retain Nixon as the Republican vice presidential candidate, and at the same time, used all means to both clear Nixon's name and counterattack the Democratic Party. The Republican campaign headquarters spent more than $75,000 to buy broadcast and television time, allowing Nixon to broadcast to the country on the 23rd to defend his acceptance of subsidies from wealthy businessmen. In his speech, Nixon pretended to be "innocent," arguing that there was "nothing wrong" with his acceptance of subsidies. Republican politicians also hired hooligans to threaten opponents who exposed their secrets. American reactionary radio commentator Pearson broadcast on the evening of the 21st that before his broadcast, Nixon's campaign car called him, "warning me that if I attacked him, he would accuse me of being pro-communist."

At the same time, Nixon exposed that Democratic presidential candidate Stevenson used a large amount of funds donated by a group of businessmen in Illinois to engage in political activities, proving that the corruption of the Democrats far exceeded that of the Republican politicians in the opposition. Supporting Republican newspapers such as the "Chicago Tribune" and the "Chicago Daily News" also focused their fire on exposing Stevenson. The "Chicago Daily News" quoted former Illinois state government purchaser McKinney as saying that Stevenson, during his tenure as Governor of Illinois, obtained a large amount of "funds" from more than 1,000 companies doing business with the state government. According to the Scripps-Howard newspaper system, the amount of this "fund" was over $100,000 or $100,000, and Stevenson used it to pay for his entertainment expenses and to subsidize candidates for state legislators who supported him. Nixon aimed at Stevenson's festering sore and fought back fiercely, publicly demanding that he and Democratic vice presidential candidate Sparkman make their sources of income public. On the evening of the 24th, Nixon threatened the other party in a speech in Wheeling that if Stevenson did not answer, "it would show that he had secrets that could not be revealed."

The current battle between the Republican and Democratic parties, in which they expose each other's ugliness, has even been marveled at by the bourgeois public opinion. Agence France-Presse's Washington dispatch on the 24th described this scene as "a magnificent scolding." The dispatch predicted that amid the rude noise, the misdeeds of the ruling groups of the two American parties would have more "new revelations."

    美国民主共和两党继续对骂  揭发出的两党秽行日见增多
    【新华社二十七日讯】美国共和党副总统候选人尼克松接受富商津贴事件被揭穿以后，华尔街豢养的两党政客们丢开了绅士的伪装，进一步互相揭发对方贪污不法的种种隐私，展开了一场丑恶不堪的大吵闹。两党之间这种猛烈的缠斗，使得美国政界难以见人的污浊翻腾起来。
    企图利用尼克松事件来增加自己竞选资本的民主党，继续对尼克松进行追击。二十一日，宾夕法尼亚州民主党众议员埃勃哈脱向新闻界发表公开信，提出了尼克松贪污受贿的新线索。埃勃哈脱质问尼克松，在他当选加利福尼亚州参议员后八个月就在华盛顿最华贵的区域“春之谷”买了一所价值四万一千美元的房子，他的钱是从哪里来的。埃勃哈脱说：要购买这座房子的第一次付款就不是一个参议员一年的薪金所能办得到的。事实表明：尼克松在一九五○年当选参议员以前，原来只不过住在月租九十二元的有两间卧室的公寓房子里。丑事揭穿、见不得人的尼克松，陷入了极其不利的处境。甚至支持共和党竞选的两家有势力的大报“纽约先驱论坛报”和“华盛顿邮报”都要求尼克松放弃副总统候选人资格。“华盛顿邮报”说：“参议员尼克松此类行为，自行取消了他的竞选资格。”尼克松所受到的重重打击，使他十分狼狈。据合众社华盛顿二十二日电说，当尼克松离开波特兰到洛杉矶去的时候，“面色苍白形容憔悴”。二十四日，尼克松飞往西弗吉尼亚州的惠灵与共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔会晤。法新社描写两人见面时的戏剧性场面说：“尼克松乘飞机抵此后就在飞机里和艾森豪威尔见了面。他们见面的时候都哭了起来……”
    但是，共和党的政客们不顾尼克松贪污丑行之被揭穿，决定继续保留尼克松为共和党副总统候选人，同时用尽一切办法，一方面替尼克松洗刷，一方面向民主党进行反攻。共和党竞选总部不惜花费七万五千多美元买得广播与电视时间，让尼克松在二十三日向全国广播，为他接受富商津贴一事作辩解。尼克松在演说中装作“无辜”，声辩他的接受津贴“并无不是之处”。共和党的政客们同时雇佣了流氓打手，威胁那些揭发他们阴私的对手。美国反动的广播评论员皮尔逊二十一日晚广播说：他在广播以前，尼克松的竞选专车来了一个电话，“警告我说，假如我抨击他的话，他将责我亲共。”
    尼克松同时揭发了民主党总统候选人史蒂文森利用伊利诺斯州一批商人捐助的大量经费来从事政治活动，证明民主党人的贪污，远远超过了在野的共和党政客。支持共和党的“芝加哥论坛报”、“芝加哥每日新闻”等家报纸也就此集中火力揭发史蒂文森。“芝加哥每日新闻”引用前伊利诺斯州政府采购人麦金尼的话，证明史蒂文森在伊利诺斯州州长任内曾从一千多家与州政府做生意的公司方面取得大量“基金”。据斯克利浦斯·霍华德系报纸透露，这笔“基金”数目在十万或十万美元以上，史蒂文森拿它来支付他的娱乐费和资助那些拥护他的该州州议员候选人。尼克松瞄准史蒂文森的这个脓疮，痛加反击，公开要求他和民主党副总统候选人斯巴克曼把收入来源公布出来。二十四晚，尼克松在惠灵发表演说时威胁对方说，如果史蒂文森不答复的话，“就说明了他有不可告人的隐秘”。
    目前共和党和民主党之间出乖露丑的交手战，甚至使资产阶级的舆论也叹为观止，法新社华盛顿二十四日电把这种场面描写为“蔚为奇观的对骂”。该电预告在粗野的吵闹声中，美国两党统治集团的秽行，将有更多的“新的揭发”。
