Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 9th: "L'Humanité" published an article on the 8th, titled "The United States Rejects British Proposal on Bacteriological Warfare."

    The article states: According to sources close to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations, due to public pressure, the British representative to the United Nations, Jebb, has twice in the past two months suggested to his American colleague, Gross, that they jointly declare that their countries would not "use bacteriological weapons first." As a result of these two suggestions, Gross submitted a special memorandum to the U.S. State Department, advocating acceptance of the British proposal. Gross said that such a gesture could help unite the majority of United Nations member states around the United States.

    According to a reliable source, the U.S. State Department and the Department of Defense rejected this proposal because they believed that such a statement would tie their hands. Washington said that agreeing to ban bacteriological weapons would also hinder the United States from opposing a ban on atomic weapons.

    In its instructions to Gross on this issue, the U.S. State Department pointed out that the United States is currently not interested in banning any weapon that can cause enormous damage at a very small cost.

    美国拒绝宣布禁用细菌武器
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社巴黎九日讯：“人道报”在八日刊载了一篇文章，题目是“美国拒绝了英国关于细菌战的建议”。
    这篇文章说：根据接近美国驻联合国代表团的人士的消息，英国驻联合国代表杰伯在过去两个月内，因为舆论的压力，曾两次向他的美国同僚葛罗斯建议共同宣布他们的国家不会“首先使用细菌武器”。由于这两次建议，葛罗斯向美国国务院提出了一个特别的备忘录，主张接受英国的建议。葛罗斯说：这样一个姿态能够帮助把大多数联合国会员国团结在美国的周围。
    据一个可靠人士的消息，美国国务院和国防部拒绝了这个建议，因为它们认为这样一个声明会把它们的双手束缚起来。华盛顿方面说，同意禁用细菌武器还会妨碍美国反对禁用原子武器。
    美国国务院在给葛罗斯的关于这个问题的指示里指出，美国目前对于禁止任何能以极小代价造成巨大损害的武器，都不感兴趣。
