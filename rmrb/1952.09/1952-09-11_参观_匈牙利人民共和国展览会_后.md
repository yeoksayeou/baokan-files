After Visiting the "Exhibition of the People's Republic of Hungary"
Industrial Labor Model Liu Dezhen

    On September 2nd, I visited the "Exhibition of the People's Republic of Hungary." At this exhibition, I deeply felt the profound friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people.

    For a long time, the Chinese people have been eager to know the face of Hungary, which is under construction. The Exhibition of the People's Republic of Hungary satisfied our requirements. Although this exhibition only shows a part of all the construction undertakings in Hungary after liberation, in this part, we have seen the achievements of the Hungarian people in political, economic and cultural construction in the past seven years since liberation, especially the great achievements in building socialist industrialization.

    The most profound impression of the Exhibition of the People's Republic of Hungary on me is the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian people in industrial production. At the exhibition, I saw various machines produced by Hungarian workers. There is a tall automatic drilling machine, which itself weighs seventeen tons, and its arm is three meters long, which can be freely rotated and lifted, and it is very flexible to operate. Its speed per minute is from fifteen to one thousand nine hundred revolutions. I saw with my own eyes that it only took three or four minutes to drill a hole with a diameter of eighty millimeters on a four or five inch thick iron plate using this kind of drilling machine. I also saw an X-ray machine for metal. I am a worker who repairs turbine generators. Recently, we are overhauling a huge turbine generator. When we checked the internal composition of the metal parts, our X-ray machine for metal broke down, which took us a lot of effort to overcome this difficulty by using radium. When I saw the exquisite X-ray machine for metal in Hungary, I was particularly happy. I told a Hungarian expert about our difficulties in checking the internal composition of metal, and he immediately said, "We will definitely help you." He was so sincere when he said this.

    At the exhibition, I also saw photos of many Stakhanovite workers in Hungary. Among them are the outstanding planer worker Ignac Bioek, the lathe worker Mrs. Istvan Sores, and Istvan Simon, the winner of the Kossuth Prize. Comrade Lasar of the Hungarian National Enterprise Bureau told me: It is not easy to get the Kossuth Prize, but there are many people who have won this prize in Hungary. This shows that the Hungarian people love labor and shows the infinite wisdom of the Hungarian working class. At the exhibition, I also saw various daily necessities, including beautiful printed fabrics, exquisite furniture and porcelain. From the quality of these daily necessities, we can know the beautiful material life of the Hungarian people. Various pictures also show that the Hungarian people are enjoying the fruits of their labor.

    In the photos of the exhibition, I saw the Hungarian people enthusiastically participating in various peace rallies; workers transported train after train of medicines and other supplies to Korea to support the Korean people in resisting American aggressors. Comrade Lasar also said to me: "Hungarian workers also do voluntary labor on Sundays to support the Korean people." Dear Hungarian worker comrades, your will to defend peace and your spirit of internationalism deeply moved me. Now our Chinese workers are responding to Chairman Mao Zedong's call to "Increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers!" At the same time, in order to welcome the upcoming Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference and our National Day, we are doubling our efforts to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, create more wealth for the motherland and for peace, and increase more strength. Dear Hungarian worker comrades, let us join hands more closely, unite around the strong fortress of peace—the Soviet Union, and continue to fight for the defense of world peace! (Attached pictures)

    参观“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”后
    工业劳动模范  刘德珍
    我在九月二日参观了“匈牙利人民共和国展览会”。在这个展览会上，我深深地体会到中匈两国人民的深厚友谊。
    很久以来，中国人民就渴望知道正在建设中的匈牙利的面貌，匈牙利人民共和国展览会满足了我们的要求。这个展览会虽然只表现了匈牙利解放后全部建设事业中的一部分，但是在这一部分当中，我们已经看到了匈牙利人民解放七年多来在政治、经济和文化建设方面的成就，特别是在建设社会主义工业化方面的巨大成就。
    匈牙利人民共和国展览会，给我最深刻的印象是匈牙利人民在工业生产上的辉煌成绩。在展览会中，我看到了匈牙利工人所生产的各种机器。有一种高大的自动钻床，它本身就有十七吨重，它的臂有三公尺长，可以自由转动和升降，操作起来非常灵活，它每分钟的速度是从转十五次到一千九百次。我亲眼看到，应用这种钻床在一块四五吋厚的铁板上钻一个直径八十糎的孔，只用了三四分钟的时间。我还看到了照金属的X光机。我是一个修理透平发电机的工人，最近我们正在大修一台巨大的透平发电机，我们在检查金属零件的内部成分时，我们的照金属的X光机出了毛病，这使我们费了很大的力量，利用镭来克服这个困难。当我看到匈牙利精美的照金属的X光机时，我感到特别高兴。我把我们检查金属内部成分的困难告诉了一个匈牙利专家，他立刻就说：“我们一定帮助你们。”他说这话时是那么诚恳。
    在展览会上，我还看到了匈牙利很多斯塔哈诺夫工作者的照片。其中有杰出的刨床工人伊格那斯·比欧克、镟床工人伊斯脱凡·少雷斯夫人，还有科舒特奖金获得者伊斯脱凡·西蒙。匈牙利国家企业局的拉萨尔同志告诉我：得到科舒特奖金是不容易的，但是在匈牙利得到这种奖金的人很多。这说明匈牙利人民是热爱劳动的，而且显示了匈牙利工人阶级的无穷智慧。在展览会上，我还看到了各式各样的日用品，有漂亮的花布，精美的家具和瓷器，从这些日用品的质量上，我们可以知道匈牙利人民美好的物质生活。在各种图片上也说明了匈牙利人民正在享受他们自己的劳动成果。
    在展览会的照片里我看到了匈牙利人民热烈参加各种和平集会；工人们把一列一列火车的医药用品等运送到朝鲜去，支持反抗美国侵略者的朝鲜人民。拉萨尔同志还对我说：“匈牙利的工人还在星期日从事义务劳动来支援朝鲜人民。”亲爱的匈牙利工人同志们，你们保卫和平的意志和国际主义精神深深地感动了我。现在我们中国工人正在响应毛泽东主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军！”的号召，同时为了迎接就要召开的亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议和我们的国庆节，正在加倍努力地开展增产节约运动，为祖国、为和平创造更多的财富，增加更多的力量。亲爱的匈牙利工人同志们，让我们更紧密地携起手来，团结在坚强的和平堡垒——苏联的周围，为保卫世界和平而继续奋斗！（附图片）
