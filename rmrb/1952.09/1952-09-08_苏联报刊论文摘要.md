Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles

    Sports and Hygiene

    The “Medical Worker” newspaper published an article by Soviet Deputy Minister of Health, Shabano夫, on July 18th, entitled “Sports and Hygiene.” The abstract is as follows:

    One of the basic characteristics of sports activities in the Soviet Union is its close connection with health organs. These health organs are entrusted with organizing medical supervision for sports work and conducting scientific research on sports activities.

    The basic tasks of medical supervision in sports and athletics are to ensure the correct organization of sports training for residents and to help promote sports and athletics widely. In addition, these health organs are also responsible for providing physical examinations for people engaged in sports activities and athletics, and for conducting sanitary inspections of the conditions of sports venues, sports activities, and competitions.

    In order to achieve these tasks, a network of medical sports organs has been widely established in the Soviet Union. In various republics, border regions, and states, new types of medical and preventive organs—medical sports clinics—have taken on the organizational and methodological leadership of medical sports work.

    One of the most important tasks of these clinics is to further promote medical sports work, to arm doctors with effective new methods, so that the physical strength and working ability of patients can be restored as soon as possible. The further development of medical sports requires the participation of doctors from all departments in this work, so that this method can be adopted more widely in various medical organs.

    Some of the largest research and academic health organs are participating in the scientific research work of medical supervision and sports. They are studying the possible health effects of sports and athletics on people of different ages, studying the causes of injuries and other damage to the health of athletes, and developing methods for examining the bodies of athletes.

    Sports organizations have raised many urgent questions to medical scientific organs, such as studying the functional state of athletes' hearts in various sports, the prevention and treatment of athletes' injuries, athletes' nutrition and hygiene rules, and so on.

    The study of these issues will improve the skills of athletes and create the most favorable conditions for them.

    Party Organizations in Hospitals

    The Soviet "Medical Worker" newspaper published an editorial on August 5th entitled "On the Tasks of Party Organizations in Hospitals." The abstract is as follows:

    The vanguard of hospital staff is the Party organization. It is composed of the most politically cultivated experts and advanced elements in the hospital who actively participate in production and social life. The direct responsibility of the communists in the hospital is to conduct political education for cadres, respond to and fully support the initiatives of advanced individuals, and fight against the conservative mentality and inertia that have not been eradicated in some medical organs. Obviously, this requires constant attention to the actual work of the staff, understanding what each department is doing, and comprehensively analyzing and evaluating the labor of the staff.

    Without gradual, calm, and purposeful educational work for people, it is impossible to imagine that the latest diagnostic and treatment methods will be adopted correctly.

    Progressive new things often encounter the indifference of some conservative staff members. The communists, who have united all the staff around them, must resolutely expose the outdated style of work and explain the significance of new working methods and new labor organizations. Party members should become models of selfless dedication to work. They should set an example of principle and uncompromising attitude towards shortcomings, and become true political guides for the masses. A communist uses personal labor and the fervent words of Bolshevik truth to instruct and educate the people around him.

    Party organizations should take advantage of the favorable conditions created by the innovation of medical organs. Correctly organizing ideological work among all hospital staff is of decisive significance. It is necessary to be good at leading people in a differentiated way and take into account their cultivation, general level, and requirements. In some medical organs, it is wrong to carry out the same propaganda and agitation to various staff members without distinction, or to only care about the education of doctors, while forgetting the large number of middle-level personnel.

    Doctors are the organizers of the medical process; they should be good at utilizing the staff. The achievement of results depends on the correct organization of the labor of nurses and assistants. Communists in some medical organs often forget this.

    In the Semashko Hospital in Tula Prefecture, almost all doctors are methodically improving their ideological level and studying the classic works of Marxism-Leninism; the Party organization is also concerned about the quality of Bolshevik propaganda. But here a serious mistake occurred—failure to pay attention to the political study of mid-level medical workers. At the end of this academic year, most of the nurses in the political groups and political schools did not complete their study plans, and some of them did not study at all. There can be no other explanation for this situation except that the role of mid-level personnel in the hospital is underestimated.

    The biggest problem in Party work is formalism, abstraction, and detachment from the specific tasks of the organ. This is the case in the Second Municipal Hospital of Minsk City. On the surface, everything here is correct: the Party education network is active, and the meetings of the Party Committee are held regularly. But the work of the Party Committee is detached from life, and it did not fight to complete the resolutions of the Party Congress. The Party Committee did not treat the facts of indifference to patients and the bad behavior of individual staff members with Bolshevik sharpness and principle.

    Undoubtedly, Party organizations in medical and preventive organs should not interfere with the administrative and handling powers of the persons in charge. At the same time, Party organizations cannot and should not replace the chief physician of the hospital. But they should study the work summaries of each department and physician, point out errors and shortcomings in a timely manner, and point out the methods of correction. Their direct responsibility is to guide the attention of all staff to solving the current urgent tasks and to establish public opinion on the facts of irresponsibility and formalism.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    体育和卫生
    “医务工作者”报七月十八日发表了苏联卫生部副部
    长沙巴诺夫所作“体育和卫生”一文，摘要如下：
    苏联体育运动的基本特点之一是它和卫生机关的密切联系。这些卫生机关受着委托，要为体育工作组织医疗监督，并对体育活动进行科学研究。
    体育和竞技方面的医疗监督的基本任务是，保证正确地组织居民的体育训练，帮助广泛地推行体育和竞技。此外，这些卫生机关也负责给从事体育活动和竞技的人们检查体格，并对运动场所的状况，体育活动和竞赛的条件做卫生检查工作。
    为了实现这些任务，在苏联已广泛设立了医疗体育机关网。在各个共和国、边区和州中，新型的医疗、预防机关——医疗体育医务所担负起了对医疗体育工作的组织和方法上的领导。
    这些医务所的最重要任务之一是进一步推行医疗体育工作，以有效的新方法来武装医生，使病人的体力和劳动能力得以尽快恢复。医疗体育的进一步发展要求各科医生参加这一工作，以便这种方法在各医务机关中能被更多地采用。
    一些最大的从事研究工作的和学术性的卫生机关都参加了对医疗监督和体育的科学研究工作。它们正在研究体育和竞技对于各种不同年龄的人们所可能发生的健康上的影响，研究能造成创伤及其他对运动员健康的损害的原因，并拟制对运动员身体进行检查的方法。
    体育团体向医药科学机关提出了很多迫切的问题，如研究在各种运动中，运动员心脏的机能状态，运动员的创伤的预防和治疗，运动员的营养和卫生规则等等。
    对于这些问题的研究将会提高运动员的技巧，为他们创造最优越的条件。
    医院中的党组织
    苏联“医务工作者”报八月五日发表了“论医院中党
    组织的任务”的社论，摘要如下：
    医院工作人员的先锋队是党组织。这是政治上最有修养的专家和医院中积极参加生产和社会生活的先进分子所组成的。医院中的共产党员的直接责任是：干部进行政治教育，响应和全力支持先进者的创议，向一些医疗机关中尚未根除的守旧心理和惰性作斗争。非常明显，这需要经常注意工作人员的实际工作，了解每一科所做的事，并全面地分析和评定工作人员的劳动。
    没有经过循序渐进的、沉着的、有目的性的对人的教育工作，那就无法设想最新的诊断和医疗方法是会被正确地采用。
    进步的新事物经常会遇到某些保守的工作人员的冷淡态度。团结了全体人员在自己周围的共产党员们，必须坚决地揭发陈腐传统的作风，解释新的工作方式和新的劳动组织的意义。党员应当成为以忘我的精神对待工作的模范。他应当作出原则性的、对缺点具有不妥协性的榜样，成为群众真正的政治指导者。一个共产党员是以个人的劳动，以布尔什维克真理的热烈言词指示和教育他的周围的人们的。
    党组织应当利用因革新医疗机关而创造出来的有利条件。在医院全体人员中正确地组织思想工作具有决定性的意义。必须善于有区别地领导人们，并顾及他们的修养、一般水平和要求。在一些医疗机关中，对各种不同的工作人员不加区别地进行同样的宣传和鼓动，或者仅仅关心于对医生的教育，同时却忘掉人数众多的中层人员，都是错误的。
    医生是医疗过程的组织者；他应当善于利用工作人员。成绩的取得有赖于正确组织护士和助理人员的劳动。一些医疗机关的共产党员时常忘记了这一点。
    在土拉州的谢马什柯医院中，几乎全部医生都有步骤地在提高着自己的思想水平，研究着马克思列宁主义的经典著作；党组织也关怀着布尔什维克的宣传质量。但是这里却发生了严重错误——不注意中级医务工作人员的政治学习。在本学年终了时，大部分政治小组和政治学校中的护士都没有完成学习计划，其中有些人甚至完全没有学习。这种情况除了归因于对医院中的中层人员的作用估计不足外，不能有其他的解释。
    党工作中最大的毛病就是形式主义、抽象、脱离机关的具体任务。明斯克市市立第二医院的情形就是这样。表面上这里一切都是正确的：党的教育网活动着，党委会的会议定期举行着。但是党委会的工作脱离生活，它没有为完成党员大会的决议而斗争。党委会没有用布尔什维克的尖锐性和原则性来对待那些以冷漠态度对待病人和个别工作人员恶劣行为的事实。
    毫无疑义，医疗预防机关中的党组织不应当干涉负责人的行政的和处理事务的职权。同时党组织不能，也不应当代替医院的主任医师。但他们应当研究各科的和医师的工作总结，及时指出错误和缺点，并指出纠正的方法。他们的直接责任是：引导全体人员注意解决当前迫切的任务并对不负责任和形式主义的事实，建立公众的舆论。
