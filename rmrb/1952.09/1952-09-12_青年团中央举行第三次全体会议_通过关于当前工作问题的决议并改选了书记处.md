    The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Holds Third Plenary Session
    Passes Resolution on Current Work Issues and Re-elects Secretariat

    [Report from this newspaper] The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League held its Third Plenary Session in Beijing from August 25th to September 4th. Thirty-eight members and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League attended the meeting, along with forty-one responsible cadres from the Communist Youth League organizations of major administrative regions, major provinces and cities, the military, and railways, as well as responsible cadres from various departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    This meeting was held under the kind instruction of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Before and during the meeting, the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao gave important instructions on the work of the Communist Youth League. Comrade Liu Shaoqi also gave a political report to the plenary session.

    The meeting focused on discussing and passing the resolution on current work issues. The resolution clearly defines the basic tasks of the Communist Youth League. The plenary session believes that the country is about to enter a high tide of economic and cultural construction, and Chinese youth should actively stand at the forefront of national construction. The meeting emphasized that young people must have more knowledge to better participate in construction work. Therefore, learning has become a more particularly prominent task for young people. The plenary session emphasized that the issues of learning, of combining learning and work, and of how the Communist Youth League assists the Party in educating the entire younger generation are the signs by which the Communist Youth League measures its own work.

    Based on the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the Third Plenary Session reviewed and discussed the work methods and work style of the Youth League committees at all levels. The plenary session believes that the true meaning of "the Communist Youth League is the Party's assistant" lies in the Communist Youth League unconditionally taking the Party's central task as its own task. Starting from implementing the Party's general line and tasks, it mobilizes and organizes the broad masses of youth to study diligently and actively participate in various tasks led by the Party. To do all this work well, the Communist Youth League organizations at all levels must earnestly accept the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels. The cadres of the League must fully exert their political, work, and learning enthusiasm, frequently study the Party's guidelines and policies, go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, and work diligently and conscientiously to embody the role of the Party's assistant with concrete work results.

    The plenary session also discussed the development of the Communist Youth League organization and the training of Communist Youth League cadres. The plenary session pointed out that the Communist Youth League currently has more than six million members, making it an unprecedentedly powerful youth organization in the history of the Chinese youth movement. However, with the development of actual struggles and the improvement of the political consciousness of the broad masses of youth, a large number of young activists are constantly emerging. Therefore, the Communist Youth League organizations in various places should adopt a positive and cautious approach and conduct the work of recruiting members in a planned manner. The plenary session determined the following guidelines for the issue of Communist Youth League cadres: actively cultivate a large number of cadres, boldly promote cadres who are loyal to the people's cause and capable, and supplement the vacancies of cadres; and in accordance with the needs of the Party, while taking into account the consolidation and development of the League, transfer cadres to the Party in a planned and step-by-step manner. For cadres below the county and district levels, excessive mobility should be avoided so that they can do their work well and facilitate the accumulation of experience within the League.

    In order to adapt to the important tasks given to the Communist Youth League by the Party, the plenary session believes that it is necessary to improve and strengthen the leadership work of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Therefore, it re-elected and expanded the Central Secretariat. The plenary session unanimously elected Hu Yaobang, Liao Chengzhi, Jiang Nanxiang, Li Chang, Rong Gaotang, Song Yiping, Liu Daosheng, Luo Yi, and Xu Shiping as secretaries, and Qu Tangliang, Gao Yangwen, Yang Shu, Zhang Ze, and Hu Keshi as alternate secretaries.

    The plenary session also invited Comrade Chen Boda to give a report on work and study issues, Comrade Qian Junrui to give a report on education issues, and Comrade Xue Muqiao to give a report on financial and economic issues.

    青年团中央举行第三次全体会议
    通过关于当前工作问题的决议并改选了书记处
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会于八月二十五日至九月四日在北京举行了第三次全体会议。出席会议的有青年团中央委员和候补中央委员共三十八人，并有各大行政区、主要省市、军队和铁道的青年团组织的负责干部以及青年团中央机关各部的负责干部等四十一人列席会议。
    这次会议是在党中央和毛主席的亲切教导下举行的。开会以前及会议期间，党中央和毛主席对青年团的工作作了重要指示。刘少奇同志并为全会作了政治报告。
    会议着重讨论并通过了关于当前工作问题的决议。决议对青年团的基本任务作了明确规定。全会认为：现在全国即将进入经济建设和文化建设的高潮，中国青年应积极地站在祖国建设的前列。会议着重指出，青年必须具有更多的知识，才能更好地参加建设工作，因此，学习就成为青年更加特别突出的任务。全会强调指出：关于学习的问题，关于学习和工作相结合的问题，关于青年团如何协助党教育好整个青年一代的问题，乃是青年团测验自己工作的标志。
    根据党中央和毛主席的指示，三中全会对各级团委的工作方法与工作作风进行了检查和讨论。全会认为：“青年团是党的助手”的真实意义，在于青年团无条件地以党的中心任务作为自己的任务，从执行党的总方针任务出发，发动和组织广大青年努力学习，积极参加党所领导的各种工作。要做好这一切工作，各级青年团的组织必须切实地接受各级党委的统一领导，团的干部要充分发挥政治上、工作上和学习上的积极性，经常研究党的方针和政策，要深入实际、深入群众，踏踏实实地埋头苦干，以切实的工作成果来体现党的助手作用。
    全会对发展青年团组织、培养青年团干部问题，也做了讨论。全会指出：目前青年团有团员六百万以上，成为中国青年运动史上前所未有的强大青年组织。但随着实际斗争的发展和广大青年政治觉悟的提高，不断地出现大批青年积极分子，因此，各地青年团组织应采取积极而慎重的方针，有计划地进行吸收团员的工作。全会对青年团干部问题，确定如下方针，即：积极培养大批干部，大胆提拔忠于人民事业并有能力的干部，补充干部的缺额；并要根据党的需要，同时照顾团的巩固和发展，有计划地有步骤地向党输送干部。对县区以下干部，则要避免流动性过大，以便使他们能够做好工作，又便于团内积累经验。
    为了适应党所给予青年团的重大任务，全会认为必须改进并加强青年团中央的领导工作，因而改选并扩大了中央书记处。全会一致选出：胡耀邦、廖承志、蒋南翔、李昌、荣高棠、宋一平、刘导生、罗毅、许世平九人为书记，区棠亮、高杨文、杨述、章泽、胡克实五人为候补书记。
    全会并请陈伯达同志作了关于工作和学习问题的报告，钱俊瑞同志作了关于教育问题的报告，薛暮桥同志作了关于财政经济问题的报告。
