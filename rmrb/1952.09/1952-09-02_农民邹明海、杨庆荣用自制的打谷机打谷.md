    Farmers Zou Minghai and Yang Qingrong Use Self-Made Threshing Machine for Threshing
    Editor: The rice of the Zou Minghai Mutual Aid Team in Xinli Township, Rong County, was threshed this year using a threshing machine they made themselves. Two months ago, the head of the mutual aid team, Zou Minghai, and team member Yang Qingrong, visited a factory and carefully observed the corn threshers and threshing machines made by the workers. After returning, they tried to make a corn thresher out of scrap iron and wood. This machine was not entirely successful, but it could still thresh some of the corn kernels. With the support of all the team members, they decided to make their own threshing machine. After more than twenty days of hard work, the threshing machine was made. At this time, early rice was being harvested, and the team members happily carried it to the field for testing. The initial test was good, and it could thresh the rice cleanly. After a while, the wheels stopped turning. The two of them repeatedly researched and modified the machine, and also went to the city to carefully visit the threshing machines made in the factory. Finally, they successfully manufactured it. Using this threshing machine to thresh grain is much more efficient than using a threshing tub; the grain is scattered less, and it saves effort.

    农民邹明海、杨庆荣用自制的打谷机打谷
    编辑同志：荣县新利乡邹明海互助组的稻谷，今年是用自己制造的打谷机打的。两个月以前，互助组长邹明海和组员杨庆荣到工厂去参观，反复仔细地看了工人制造的玉米脱粒机和打谷机。回来后，他们自己用废铁和木料试制了一部玉米脱粒机。这部机器没有完全成功，但也能把玉米的部分籽粒脱下来。在全体组员支持下，他们决心自制一部打谷机。费了二十多天功夫，打谷机制好了。这时正收割早稻，组员们高高兴兴地把它抬下田去试验。开始试验还不错，能够把稻子都打干净，过了一会儿，轮子就不能转动了。他们两人又三番两次的研究、改造，还到城里去仔细参观工厂制造的打谷机，最后终于制造成功。用这个打谷机打谷，比用拌桶打谷的效率高得多；谷子抛散的少，又省力气。  四川荣县农民报　王大永
