Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 23rd – The powerful sanitation movement in the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers has effectively improved the health of the troops and defeated the bacteriological warfare of US imperialism. The Korean and Chinese People's forces originally had a strong foundation in sanitation work. Since the beginning of this year, when the American aggressors launched large-scale bacteriological warfare on the Korean battlefield, the Korean and Chinese People's armies have further strengthened this work in the struggle against bacteriological warfare. In the past eight months, the Korean and Chinese People's armies have not only been able to promptly eliminate the bacteria-carrying insects and objects scattered by enemy aircraft, and effectively control the spread of epidemics, but also, due to the further strengthening of sanitation work, the general seasonal epidemic diseases have also been greatly reduced compared to the past.

The American aggressors brazenly violated international law by conducting large-scale bacteriological warfare, arousing high degrees of anger and hatred among the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Under the slogan of "Resolutely Defeat American Imperialism's Bacteriological Warfare," the Korean and Chinese People's armies rapidly adopted various emergency and effective measures to launch a struggle against bacteriological warfare together with the people of North Korea. All sanitation measures were carried out under the personal command and supervision of the unit leaders. As soon as an alarm sounded, the troops stationed in the area immediately mobilized to quickly eliminate the bacteria-carrying insects and objects dropped by enemy aircraft. The medical and health workers of each unit also formed countless mobile combat teams, and upon receiving a report of an epidemic, they could immediately go to the location where the epidemic occurred to carry out disinfection and other measures. According to incomplete statistics, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers eliminated 200,000 various bacteria-carrying insects dropped by enemy aircraft in its area within less than a month. Due to the strict prevention, disinfection, isolation, and good sanitation work carried out in the troops, the spread of epidemics was prevented. For example, after Chang Jinlong, the deputy squad leader of a certain company of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and Ge Quanshu, a health worker of a certain company, were killed by American bacteriological warfare, not a single person in their unit was infected with plague again.

While eliminating the bacteria-carrying insects and objects scattered by enemy aircraft, the Korean and Chinese People's forces launched a campaign to eliminate bacterial vectors. Commanders and combatants overcame the difficulties of material conditions, created tools for capturing bacterial vector insects, and massively eliminated rats, fleas, flies, mosquitoes, etc. In this movement, many model units and individuals emerged. For example, a certain company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers captured more than 80,000 rats in just two months; Li Shufang, a sanitation officer of a certain unit, made more than 450 rat traps by himself; and soldier Chen Zhongcai made 12 rat traps by himself and captured 164 rats in one month.

After the sanitation movement, with anti-bacterial warfare as the central combat task, was launched, the commanders and combatants of the Korean and Chinese People's forces used their labor and wisdom to improve personal hygiene and environmental sanitation. They built a large number of wells, kitchens, canteens, bathhouses, delousing rooms, and ensured regular bathing, scalding of clothes, frequent cleaning of the area, dredging of ditches, removal of garbage and feces, and filling of sewage pits, etc. Some units also sent people to burn lime for moisture-proofing and disinfection. This year, the Chinese People's Volunteers also universally used the spare time of combat duty to reclaim wasteland and grow vegetables to supply the troops with the vegetables they needed to improve the nutritional conditions of the troops; at the same time, sports, cultural, and recreational activities were carried out throughout the army. All of this has further improved the health of the troops.

An important condition for the victory of the sanitation movement in the anti-bacterial warfare of the Korean and Chinese People's armies in the past eight months was the support of the Chinese people and the strong support of the people of the world. When the use of bacterial weapons by the American invading army was first discovered, the Chinese people dispatched the Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteer Epidemic Prevention and Inspection Team composed of their outstanding scientists and technicians to Korea, and at the same time continuously transported a large number of medicines and equipment to the Korean front, ensuring the victory of the sanitation movement in the anti-bacterial warfare of the Korean and Chinese People's armies. The condemnation and protest of the just people of the world against the bacteriological warfare crimes of US imperialism deeply made the commanders and combatants of the Korean and Chinese People's armies feel that behind them were not only the Korean and Chinese people, but also the people of the Soviet Union, the people of all people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people in the world. The commanders and combatants expressed their respect for the investigation teams and individuals who risked dangers to come to Korea to conduct a fair investigation, especially the famous scientists of various countries of the International Scientific Commission who recently came to Korea to conduct an investigation, because they further confirmed the crime of the US government in conducting bacteriological warfare with iron facts and serious scientific arguments.

Now, although the Korean and Chinese People's armies have achieved a great victory in the anti-bacterial warfare, the American aggressors have not withdrawn their claws and continue to spread bacteria in Korea. The Korean and Chinese People's armies will never relax the struggle against bacteriological warfare, and will continue to strengthen the sanitation work of the troops, striving to continuously improve the health of the troops and completely defeat the enemy's bacteriological warfare.

### 朝中部队反细菌战取得伟大胜利  卫生工作进一步加强，部队健康水平提高

    朝中部队反细菌战取得伟大胜利
    卫生工作进一步加强，部队健康水平提高
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十三日电】朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军中的强大卫生运动，有效地提高了部队人员的健康水平，打败了美帝国主义的细菌战。朝中人民部队原来有卫生工作的坚强基础，自从今年初美国侵略者在朝鲜战场进行大规模的细菌战以来，朝中人民军队又在反细菌战的斗争中，进一步加强了这一工作。八个多月来，朝中人民军队不仅能够及时地扑灭了敌机投撒的带细菌昆虫和物体，有效地控制了疫病的蔓延，同时，由于卫生工作的进一步加强，使一般季节性的流行疾病也较过去大为减少。
    美国侵略者悍然破坏国际公法进行大规模的细菌战，激起了朝中人民军队高度的愤怒和仇恨。在
    “坚决打败美帝国主义细菌战”的口号下，朝中人民军队迅速地采取了各项紧急而有效的措施，与北朝鲜人民一起展开了反细菌战的斗争。卫生各项措施都在部队首长亲自指挥和督促下进行。一闻警号，驻区部队立即出动，将敌机所投带菌昆虫和物体迅速扑灭。各部队的医务卫生工作人员，也组成无数支机动的战斗队，接到疫情报告，便能立即前往发生疫病地点进行消毒等项措施。据不完全统计，中国人民志愿军某部在不到一个月的时间内，即在驻区扑灭了二十万个敌机投下的各种带菌虫类。由于在部队中进行了严密的预防、消毒、隔离及良好的卫生工作，因而阻止了疫病的蔓延。例如中国人民志愿军某连副班长常金龙及某连卫生员葛权书被美国细菌战杀害以后，他们所在的单位便再没有一个人传染到鼠疫。
    与扑灭敌机投撒的带菌昆虫物体的同时，朝中人民部队发动了捕灭细菌媒介物的运动。指挥员、战斗员们克服了物质条件的困难，创造了捕捉细菌媒介虫豸的工具，大量地捕灭了老鼠、跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊子等。在这一运动中，出现了许多模范的单位和个人。如中国人民志愿军某部的一个连，仅仅在两个月中就捕鼠八万多只；某部卫生干事李树芳一人即做了四百五十多个捕鼠器；战士陈中才一个人做了十二个捕鼠器，在一个月中捕鼠一百六十四只。
    以反细菌战为中心战斗任务的卫生运动展开以后，朝中人民部队的指挥员战斗员们用自己的劳动和智慧，改善了个人卫生和环境卫生。他们大量修建了水井、厨房、食堂、澡堂、灭虱室，做到定时洗澡、烫洗衣服，经常清扫驻区，疏通沟渠，清除垃圾、粪便，填污水坑等。有的单位还派人去烧制石灰，以供防潮、消毒之用。今年中国人民志愿军还普遍利用战斗勤务的余暇开荒种菜，供给部队所需的菜蔬，以改善部队的营养条件；同时又在全军开展体育文化娱乐活动。这一切，使部队人员的健康水平更加提高了。
    八个月来，朝中人民军队反细菌战的卫生运动获得胜利的一个重要条件，就是中国人民的支援和世界人民的有力声援。在刚刚发现美国侵略军使用细菌武器的时候，中国人民就派出了自己优秀的科学家和技术人员组成的抗美援朝志愿防疫检验队来到朝鲜，同时向朝鲜前线源源不断地运送了大批医药器材，使朝中人民军队反细菌战的卫生运动的胜利得到了充分的物质保证。世界正义人民对美帝国主义细菌战罪行的谴责和抗议，使朝中人民军队的指挥员战斗员们深深地感到：站在他们后面的不仅有朝鲜人民和中国人民，而且还有苏联人民、各人民民主国家的人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民。指挥员和战斗员们对于不避艰险到朝鲜来进行公正调查的调查团体和个人，特别是最近曾来朝鲜调查的国际科学委员会的各国著名科学家表示敬意，因为他们用铁一般的事实和严正的科学论据进一步证实了美国政府进行细菌战的罪行。
    现在朝中人民军队虽然已经在反细菌战中取得了伟大的胜利，但美国侵略者尚未收回它的魔爪，在朝鲜继续散布细菌。朝中人民军队绝不松懈反细菌战的斗争，并将继续加强部队卫生工作，为不断提高部队的健康水平，彻底打败敌人的细菌战而努力。
