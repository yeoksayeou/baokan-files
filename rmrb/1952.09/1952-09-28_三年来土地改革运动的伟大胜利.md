    The Great Victory of the Land Reform Movement in the Past Three Years
    Liao Luyan, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council of the Central People's Government

    The land reform movement has been basically completed nationwide. In the past three years, land reform has been completed in areas with approximately 300 million agricultural population. Including the old liberated areas where land reform was completed three years ago, the agricultural population in areas where land reform has been completed accounts for more than 90 percent of the total agricultural population nationwide. With the exception of ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet, and Taiwan, which is yet to be liberated, only areas with 30 million agricultural population have not yet completed land reform, and these areas will also complete land reform in 1952 or at the latest before the spring plowing of 1953. In the agricultural areas of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, land reform will also be implemented this winter and next spring.

    For more than two thousand years, Chinese peasants under the heavy pressure of feudalism have been liberated. They have changed from being the cattle and horses of the landlord class to the rulers of the countryside, and they have changed from being the slaves of the land to the masters of the land. This earth-shattering historical victory is a victory won by the Chinese working class and its party—the Communist Party—leading the peasants and fighting unyieldingly and tenaciously with the peasants for thirty years; it is a victory of Mao Zedong Thought; and it is also a victory of the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin on the peasant question in China.

    (I) How Was the Victory of Land Reform Achieved?

    Why was it possible to complete land reform in areas with 300 million agricultural population in such a short period of three years?

    First, the general line and general policy on land reform stipulated by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party were resolutely implemented in the land reform—relying on the landless and poor peasants, uniting with the middle peasants, neutralizing the rich peasants, and eliminating the feudal exploitation system step by step and with distinction to develop agricultural production.

    The practice of the land reform movement in the past three years has fully proved that the poor peasants and farm laborers, who account for 70 percent of the rural population and own little or no land, are the backbone of the movement, and they are the most active and resolute in the struggle for land reform. They account for the majority of the leadership in farmers' associations in various places. The elimination of feudal land reform was achieved by relying on the broad masses of poor peasants and farm laborers. At the same time, poor peasants and farm laborers also received land equivalent to about 90 percent of the local average per capita land ownership, basically satisfying their urgent land demands.

    The interests of the middle peasants, who account for 20 percent of the rural population, have also been resolutely protected in the land reform movement. Article 7 of the Land Reform Law stipulates: "Protect the land and other property of middle peasants (including rich middle peasants), and shall not be infringed upon." All localities have resolutely implemented this provision. In the land reform, the part of the middle peasants who owned more land than the local average per capita land ownership were protected and remained untouched, while some land-deficient middle peasants were allocated land, so the average per capita land ownership of the entire middle peasant class increased compared with before the land reform. At the same time, middle peasants generally gained huge benefits from the anti-hegemony, rent reduction, and deposit refund movements that preceded the land reform. In the leadership of farmers' associations in various places, it was also guaranteed that middle peasant components accounted for no less than one-third. Therefore, this ensured the solid unity of farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants, forming a united front of peasants accounting for more than 90 percent of the rural population. This prevented the poor peasants and farm laborers from being isolated, while isolating the landlords, ensuring the victory of land reform.

    The policy of preserving the rich peasant economy was adopted. Article 6 of the Land Reform Law stipulates: "Protect the land and other property owned by rich peasants who cultivate themselves and employ others, and shall not be infringed upon," and all localities have resolutely implemented it. After the implementation of land reform, the land retained by each rich peasant was generally still equivalent to twice the local average per capita land ownership. In some places, the small amount of land rented out by rich peasants was not confiscated and was still retained. This did indeed make the rich peasants, who have always been allies of the landlord class in the countryside, neutral in the struggle for land reform, making the landlord class more isolated and more conducive to the elimination of the landlord class.

    As a result of land reform, the landlord class was eliminated, but the landlord individuals were not eliminated. According to Article 10 of the Land Reform Law, landlords were also allocated the same amount of land as the peasants, so that they could transform themselves through labor; the industrial and commercial enterprises兼營 operated by landlords and the land and property directly used for operating industrial and commercial enterprises were also not confiscated, distinguishing the landlord's feudal land property from the industrial and commercial enterprises they concurrently operated, and treating them separately. Only those lawless landlords and bullies who committed heinous crimes, owed heavy debts of blood, aroused great popular indignation, and resisted or sabotaged land reform were punished according to law, even sentenced to death. This also played a certain divisive role in the landlord class, weakened the landlord class's resistance to land reform, and facilitated the progress of land reform.

    Because all localities conscientiously implemented and correctly executed the general line and general policy of land reform and the Land Reform Law that specifically embodied this general line and general policy, this ensured that the land reform movement in the past three years achieved unprecedented and great victory.

    Second, the policy of leading and boldly mobilizing the masses was conscientiously implemented, and the combination of leading cadres and the broad masses was achieved.

    Land reform is a fierce class struggle. It is necessary to boldly mobilize the broad masses of peasants and let them consciously act to confiscate the land of the landlord class and distribute it to the landless and land-poor peasants before land reform can be thoroughly realized. And boldly mobilizing the masses must be led, educating the masses to master the policies, so that the policies and laws are truly familiar to the masses and become the masses' weapon to fight against the landlords.

    In order to deeply mobilize the masses, all localities organized a large number of land reform work teams to go to the countryside, reaching more than 300,000 people each year. After the land reform work teams arrived in the countryside, they generally adopted a combination of visiting the poor and asking about their suffering, connecting with the complaints of others, and convening peasant representative meetings and holding short-term training classes for peasant activists to gradually and deeply and extensively organize the peasants, from a small number of poor peasant and farm laborer groups to a mass farmers' association including middle peasants. Through multiple peasant mass meetings and peasant representative meetings, the peasants were educated with their own experiences in the form of complaining about their suffering, enlightening the peasants' class consciousness; and explaining the policies to the peasants to improve the peasants' political awareness and policy level, and then the broad masses of peasants consciously acted to carry out face-to-face sharp struggles with the landlord class, forcing the landlord class to yield in the face of the power of the masses, confiscating the land, livestock, farm tools, grain and other property of the landlord class, and distributing them to the landless and land-poor peasants and peasants lacking means of production to realize land reform. The experience of the past three years has proved that without boldly mobilizing the broad masses of peasants, land reform cannot be truly and thoroughly realized. Without boldly mobilizing the masses and simply relying on administrative orders, the so-called "peaceful land reform" and "official land reform" from top to bottom will certainly not truly overthrow the landlord class and truly realize land reform, and of course, there is no question of consolidating the achievements of land reform.

    Third, the broadest anti-feudal united front was established in urban and rural areas. In the past three years, not only was a united front of poor peasants, farm laborers and middle peasants, accounting for 90 percent of the population, established in the countryside, protecting small land landlords出租者, neutralizing rich peasants; but also in the cities, workers, staff, youth and students supported land reform. And many university professors went to the countryside to visit and participate in land reform. At the same time, because the policy of protecting industry and commerce was implemented in the land reform, many industrial and commercial capitalists who were connected with feudal land exploitation were also absorbed into the anti-feudal united front. There were some enlightened gentry among the landlord class who had opposed the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek and imperialist aggression, actively supported the people's democratic cause, and supported the people's democratic dictatorship and supported land reform, and they were also absorbed to participate in land reform or the work of the people's government and people's organizations. This won them over to continue to cooperate with us.

    All localities conscientiously implemented these policies in the process of land reform, established the broadest anti-feudal united front in urban and rural areas, more powerfully isolated the landlord class, and made it more conducive to the smooth completion of land reform.

    (II) The New Face of the Countryside After Land Reform

    Land reform has produced huge economic, political, and cultural effects, causing a leap in change. After the completion of land reform, the face of the countryside has been renewed.

    First, economically, after the vast number of peasants have obtained land and other means of production and livelihood, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has greatly increased, agricultural production has rapidly recovered and developed, and the peasants' lives have also been significantly improved.

    About 60 to 70 percent of the agricultural population benefited economically in the land reform. About 300 million peasants, including those in the old liberated areas, benefited throughout the country, and about 700 million mu of land was distributed to the peasants. Before the land reform, the peasants paid more than 30 million tons of grain in rent to the landlords every year for cultivating these 700 million mu of land, but now they no longer pay rent. The peasants no longer work for the landlords.

    On their own land, the peasants are carrying out a large-scale patriotic production increase competition movement, working for their own happiness and national construction. Tens of millions of peasants are actively participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives, and replacing and adding some of the distributed means of production with a large number of livestock, waterwheels and new agricultural tools to improve and expand their operations, thereby gradually improving agricultural production technology, and the entire agricultural production can also be rapidly restored and developed. In 1951, the national grain production increased by 28 percent compared with 1949, and this year it may increase by about 40 percent compared with 1949, which can exceed 9 percent of the highest annual output before the Anti-Japanese War. The output of industrial raw material crops such as cotton in 1951 has exceeded the highest record in history. With the development of agricultural production, the lives of the peasants will naturally improve accordingly. In many areas, the proportion of middle peasants in the rural population has developed from about 20 percent in the past to about 80 percent; poor peasants and farm laborers have decreased from about 70 percent to 10 or 20 percent; and are decreasing year by year.

    Second, politically, due to the progress of land reform, the political consciousness of the peasants has been greatly improved. The vast number of peasants have become the pillar of the people's regime in the countryside, thereby consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    After land reform, the vast number of peasants love Chairman Mao, the Communist Party and the People's Government even more.

    Through the exercise of land reform struggles, a large number of peasant activists emerged in every village. In 1951 alone, more than 300,000 peasant activists in East China joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The number of members of the Farmers' Association in the four major administrative regions of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest has reached more than 88 million, of which women account for about 30 percent. In general, the true advantage of the peasants has been established in rural areas. The Farmers' Association has a high prestige there, truly grasping the rural regime, disarming the landlords, arming themselves, and controlling those restless landlords who do not obey labor reform. The peasants have truly become the masters of the countryside. At the same time, on the basis of the peasant representative meetings developed in the land reform, the system of people's representative meetings has been enriched, improved and established, truly consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas, and truly making our country realize democratization.

    Third, culturally, land reform has also greatly promoted the development of rural culture. The number of schools and students in rural primary schools has increased significantly. In the second half of this year, the number of primary school students nationwide can reach 49 million, accounting for 65 percent of the total number of school-age children, 75 million. At the same time, some of the current primary school students are overage. The number of adult men and women peasants participating in winter school is also increasing year by year, and many winter schools have actually become perennial remedial schools for adult peasants. Literacy classes, reading groups, and blackboards have also been established in many remote rural areas. Now all parts of the country are preparing to widely use Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method on the basis of the peasants' urgent demand to improve their culture this winter to launch the work of eliminating illiteracy, which will become a new cultural upsurge in the countryside after the completion of land reform.

    (III) The Successful Completion of Land Reform and National Industrialization

    Our country's large-scale planned economic construction is about to begin. The basic completion of land reform nationwide is one of the prerequisites for starting large-scale planned economic construction. The practice of the past three years has proved that land reform has greatly promoted the rapid recovery and development of the entire agricultural production, ensuring the national people's demand for food and increasing the output of industrial raw material crops. The purchasing power of peasants has also increased rapidly. In 1951, the purchasing power of the national people increased by about 25 percent compared with 1950; from the sales volume of several daily necessities, the sales volume of yarn increased by 10 percent in 1951 compared with 1950, cigarettes increased by 14 percent, matches increased by 20 percent, sugar increased by 44 percent, kerosene increased by 47 percent, and tea increased by 70 percent. This shows the trend of increasing purchasing power of the broad masses of peasants after land reform. Agricultural production will gradually develop, and the purchasing power of peasants will gradually increase, which will provide an infinitely broad domestic market for our country's industrial products.

    After the completion of land reform, the peasants are moving forward according to the path of organizing themselves as indicated by Chairman Mao. Especially in the past year, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agriculture in various places has developed greatly. In the old liberated areas of Northeast China and North China, the organized labor force generally accounts for 60 percent of the total agricultural labor force, and some even reach more than 80 percent; in East China, Central South, Southwest and other areas that were liberated later, the organized labor force generally accounts for about 25 to 40 percent. Northeast China and North China have also each organized one or two thousand agricultural production cooperatives. The mutual aid and cooperation movement now being carried out in the countryside will further improve agricultural productivity, develop agricultural production, give our country's industrialization a greater impetus, and thereby realize agricultural mechanization on the basis of national industrialization. Chinese peasants will advance along this bright and happy road. (Xinhua News Agency)

    三年来土地改革运动的伟大胜利
    中央人民政府政务院副秘书长　廖鲁言
    土地改革运动已在全国范围内基本上完成。约有三亿农业人口的地区，在这三年之中完成了土地改革。加上三年以前即已完成土地改革的老解放区，完成土地改革地区的农业人口已共占全国农业人口总数的百分之九十以上。除新疆、西藏等少数民族地区及尚待解放的台湾以外，只有三千万农业人口的地区尚未完成土地改革，这些地区也将在一九五二年内至迟于一九五三年春耕以前完成土地改革。在新疆各民族的农业区，也将于今冬明春实行土地改革。
    两千多年来在封建大山重压之下的中国农民已经翻了身。他们由地主阶级的牛马变成了农村的统治者，他们由土地的奴隶变成了土地的主人。这一翻天覆地的历史胜利，是中国工人阶级及其政党——共产党三十年来领导着农民并和农民在一起不屈不挠顽强斗争而得来的胜利；是毛泽东思想的胜利；也是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林关于农民问题的理论在中国的胜利。
    （一）土地改革是怎样取得胜利的
    为什么在这短短的三年之中，能在三亿农业人口的地区完成土地改革呢？
    第一、在土地改革中，坚决执行了毛主席和中国共产党中央所规定的关于土地改革的总路线与总政策——依靠贫农、雇农，团结中农，中立富农，有步骤地有分别地消灭封建剥削制度，发展农业生产。
    三年来土地改革运动的实践完全证明：占农村人口百分之七十无地和少地的贫农和雇农，是运动的骨干，他们在土地改革斗争中最积极、最坚决。他们在各地农民协会的领导成份中占多数。消灭封建的土地改革，就是依靠着广大的贫雇农群众才得以胜利实现的。同时，贫农、雇农也得到了相当于当地每人占有土地平均数的百分之九十左右的土地，基本上满足了他们迫切的土地要求。
    占农村人口百分之二十的中农的利益，在土地改革运动中也得到了坚决的保护。土地改革法第七条规定：“保护中农（包括富裕中农在内）的土地及其他财产，不得侵犯”。各地都坚决执行了这一条规定。在土地改革中对占有土地高于当地每人平均数的一部分中农，保护不动，而一部分缺地的中农则分进了土地，因而整个中农阶层每人占有土地的平均数较之土地改革以前增加了。同时，中农从土地改革前奏的反霸、减租和退押运动中，一般都获得了巨大的利益。在各地农民协会的领导成份中，也保证了中农成份不少于三分之一。因而，这就保证了雇农贫农与中农的巩固团结，形成了占农村人口百分之九十以上的农民的统一战线。这就使贫雇农避免陷于孤立，而孤立了地主，保证了土地改革的胜利。
    采取了保存富农经济的方针。土地改革法第六条规定“保护富农所有自耕和雇人耕种的土地及其他财产，不得侵犯”，各地也都坚决执行了。富农在土地改革实行后，每人所保有的土地，一般仍相当于当地每人占有土地平均数的二倍。有些地方，对富农的小量出租土地也未征收，仍予保留。这的确使历来在农村中做为地主阶级同盟者的富农，在土地改革斗争中中立起来了，使地主阶级更陷于孤立，更有利于消灭地主阶级。
    土地改革的结果，消灭了地主阶级，但并没有消灭地主个人。按照土地改革法第十条的规定，地主亦被分给与农民同样的一份土地，使他们在劳动中改造自己；对地主兼营的工商业及其直接用于经营工商业的土地和财产，亦不予没收，把地主的封建土地财产与其兼营的工商业区别开来，分别对待。只有对那些罪大恶极，血债累累，民愤甚大和抗拒或破坏土地改革的不法地主恶霸才依法惩办，直至判处死刑。这在地主阶级中也起了一定的分化作用，减弱了地主阶级对土地改革的抵抗，而有利于土地改革的进行。
    由于各地认真贯彻与正确执行了土地改革的总路线与总政策以及具体体现这一总路线与总政策的土地改革法，这就保证了三年来的土地改革运动获得了空前伟大的胜利。
    第二，认真贯彻了有领导地放手发动群众的方针，做到了领导骨干与广大群众相结合。
    土地改革是一场激烈的阶级斗争，必须放手发动广大农民群众，由广大农民群众自觉地行动起来，没收地主阶级的土地，分配给无地少地的农民，土地改革才能彻底实现。而放手发动群众又必须是有领导的，教育群众掌握政策，使政策法令真正为群众所熟悉，成为群众向地主斗争的武器。
    为了深入地发动群众，各地都组织了大批的土地改革工作队到农村中去，每年达三十万人以上。土地改革工作队到农村以后，一般采用了访贫问苦、诉苦串连与召开农民代表会议、举办农民积极分子短期训练班相结合的方式，逐步深入地而又广泛地把农民组织起来，由少数人的贫雇农小组逐步发展到包含中农在内的群众性的农民协会。经过多次的农民群众大会与农民代表会议，以诉苦的方式，用农民群众自己亲身的经历教育农民，启发农民的阶级觉悟；并向农民解释政策，以提高农民的政治觉悟与政策水平，然后由广大农民群众自觉地行动起来，与地主阶级进行面对面的尖锐的斗争，逼使地主阶级在群众的威力面前屈服低头，没收地主阶级的土地及耕畜、农具、粮食等财产，分配给无地少地及缺乏生产资料的农民，实现土地改革。三年来的经验证明，没有广大农民群众的放手发动，土地改革是不能真正彻底实现的。不放手发动群众，单纯依靠行政命令，从上而下的所谓“和平土改”、“官办土改”，一定不能真正地打倒地主阶级，不能真正实现土地改革，当然更谈不到土地改革成绩的巩固了。
    第三、建立了城乡最广泛的反封建统一战线。三年以来，不但在农村建立了占人口百分之九十以上的贫雇农和中农的统一战线，保护了小土地出租者，中立了富农；而且在城市中，工人、职员、青年学生也是拥护土地改革的。并有许多大学教授到农村中去参观和参加了土地改革。同时，又因为在土地改革中执行了保护工商业的政策，因而许多与封建土地剥削有联系的工商业资本家，也都被吸收到反封建的统一战线中来。地主阶级中有某些个别的开明绅士，他们曾经反对蒋介石反动统治和帝国主义侵略，以积极行动赞助人民民主事业，并拥护人民民主专政和赞助土地改革，也吸收他们参加土地改革或人民政府、人民团体的工作。这就争取了他们仍与我们继续合作。
    各地在土地改革过程中，都认真地贯彻了这些政策，建立了城乡最广泛的反封建统一战线，更有力地孤立了地主阶级，更有利于土地改革的顺利完成。
    （二）土地改革后农村的新面貌
    土地改革在经济上、政治上、文化上都产生了巨大的效果，引起了飞跃的变化。土地改革完成以后，农村面貌为之一新。
    第一，在经济上，广大农民在获得土地及其他生产资料和生活资料后，农民的生产积极性大大提高，农业生产迅速恢复和发展，农民生活也获得显著的改善。
    土地改革中获得经济利益的农民约占农业人口的百分之六十到七十，全国得利农民连老解放区在内约三亿人，约有七亿亩土地分给了农民。在土地改革以前，农民为耕种这七亿亩土地，每年给地主交纳的地租即达三千万吨以上的粮食，现在已不再交租了。农民已不再为地主劳动。
    农民在自己的土地上，正在开展大规模的爱国增产竞赛运动，为自己的幸福和国家建设而劳动着。数以千万计的农民都积极参加互助组和农业生产合作社，并把分得的若干生产资料变换添置为大量的耕畜、水车及新式农具，以改善和扩大自己的经营，从而农业生产技术也逐渐提高，整个农业生产也得以迅速恢复和发展。一九五一年全国粮食生产量较一九四九年增加百分之二十八，今年可较一九四九年增加百分之四十左右，可超过抗日战争以前最高年产量百分之九。棉花等工业原料作物一九五一年的产量均已超过了历史上的最高纪录。随着农业生产的发展，农民生活自然也随之改善。在许多地区，中农在农村人口中所占的比例，已由过去的百分之二十左右发展到百分之八十左右；贫雇农则由百分之七十左右减少到百分之十或二十；而且在逐年减少中。
    第二，在政治上，由于土地改革的进行，极大地提高了农民的政治觉悟，广大农民已成为农村里人民政权的支柱，因而巩固了人民民主专政，也巩固了工农联盟。
    在土地改革以后，广大农民更加热爱毛主席、共产党和人民政府。
    经过土地改革斗争的锻炼，村村涌现出大批农民积极分子，一九五一年仅华东地区就有三十余万农民积极分子加入中国新民主主义青年团。农民协会会员仅华东、中南、西南、西北四大行政区已达八千八百余万人，其中妇女约占百分之三十左右。一般乡村均已树立了农民的真正优势，农民协会在那里有很高的威信，真正掌握了农村政权，解除了地主的武装，武装了自己，管制着那些不安分的不服从劳动改造的地主，农民真正成了农村的主人。同时，在土地改革中发展起来的农民代表会议的基础之上，充实健全并建立了人民代表会议的制度，真正在农村中巩固地树立了人民民主专政，真正使我们国家实现了民主化。
    第三，在文化上，土地改革也大大地促进了农村文化的发展。农村小学的学校数与学生数均有显著的增加。今年下半年全国小学学生数可达四千九百万人，占学龄儿童总数七千五百万人的百分之六十五。同时，在现有的小学学生中还有一部分超龄的学生。成年男女农民参加冬学的人数也逐年加多，且有不少冬学实际已成为成年农民的常年补习学校了。识字班、读报组、黑板报，在许许多多偏僻的农村中，也都建立起来了。现在全国各地正准备在农民的这种提高文化的迫切要求基础之上，于今年冬季开始广泛运用祁建华速成识字法，展开扫除文盲工作，这将成为土地改革完成后农村中新的文化高潮。
    （三）土地改革的胜利完成与国家工业化
    我们国家大规模的计划经济建设即将开始。土地改革在全国范围内基本完成，是开始大规模计划经济建设的前提条件之一。三年来的实践证明，土地改革大大地促进了整个农业生产的迅速恢复与发展，保证了全国人民粮食的需要量，增产了工业原料作物。农民的购买力也迅速提高了，一九五一年全国人民的购买力较之一九五零年即增加百分之二十五左右；从几种日用必需品的销售量看：纱布一九五一年较之一九五○年增加百分之十，纸烟增加百分之十四，火柴增加百分之二十，糖增加百分之四十四，煤油增加百分之四十七，茶叶增加百分之七十。这可看出广大农民群众在土地改革后购买力增长的趋势。农业生产逐年发展，农民购买力将逐步提高，这就给我国的工业产品提供了无限广阔的国内市场。
    在土地改革完成后，农民按照毛主席所指示的组织起来的道路前进。特别是近一年来，各地农业互助合作运动更有很大的发展，东北和华北老解放区，组织起来的劳动力一般占农业劳动力总数的百分之六十，有的达百分之八十以上；在华东、中南、西南等解放较晚的地区，组织起来的劳动力一般在百分之二十五到四十左右。东北、华北两区还各组织起一两千个农业生产合作社。现在农村中开展的互助合作运动，将更进一步地提高农业生产力，发展农业生产，给我们国家工业化以更大的推动，并从而在国家工业化的基础上实现农业机械化。中国农民将沿着这一条光明、幸福的道路前进。（新华社）
