    Technical Guidance Alone Is Not Enough to Promote Advanced Experience
    Guo Yawei, Engineer of the Second Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau

    In May of this year, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the National Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union sent cadres to the Second Mine of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau to assist in promoting the multi-borehole cyclic operation method of the Ma Liuhai group. The Second Mine also organized a tunneling work brigade, led by technical personnel, to promote the advanced experience of the Ma Liuhai group. In the experiment, some comrades also realized the superiority of this advanced experience. However, it only lasted for twenty days before they gave up.

    Why did the promotion work fail? I think the key is that the leadership believed that technical guidance alone could promote advanced experience, and thus ignored the ideological leadership of workers, technicians, and grassroots cadres. Promoting advanced experience is a struggle between creative advanced ideas and backward conservative ideas. Imagine, what will happen if ideological leadership is neglected in this struggle? This can be seen from our promotion work.

    In our promotion, the first step was to learn to work according to the indicated charts. Although the workers learned it, they always felt unfamiliar when applying it, not as skilled as the old single-hole operation method. At this time, relying solely on technical personnel to provide technical guidance to the workers led to impatience. Because their ideological problems were not solved, they did not understand why they should learn and promote the experience of others. Therefore, despite the technical personnel's explanations, they still clung to the old methods.

    The technical personnel also did not solve the problem ideologically. Although they also admitted the superiority of the Ma Liuhai group's operation method and could provide some technical guidance together with the workers. However, because the workers' ideological problems were not solved, and the promotion work did not produce results, they no longer insisted on promoting the work.

    The grassroots cadres of the mine (district leaders, squad leaders, group leaders, etc.) are mostly promoted from among the workers. They are familiar with the technology, but the old production methods are deeply rooted in their minds. In addition, they lack scientific theoretical knowledge, so they cannot quickly accept advanced experience. Among them, there is the idea of "better to do less than more," seeking to avoid mistakes rather than achieve merit, and fearing failing to complete tasks or accidents. In this way, they naturally cannot actively and responsibly promote advanced experience.

    From the above situation, it can be seen that although advanced experience is inseparable from improving technology and raising technical levels, ideological education cannot be ignored by relying solely on technical guidance when promoting advanced experience. Otherwise, advanced experience will certainly not be promoted.

### 单靠技术指导是不能推广先进经验的

    单靠技术指导是不能推广先进经验的
    峰峰矿务局第二矿工程师　郭亚伟
    今年五月间，燃料工业部煤矿管理总局和煤矿工会全国委员会，曾派干部到峰峰矿务局第二矿协助推广马六孩小组的多孔道循环作业法。二矿也组织了一个掘进工作大队，由技术人员负责，进行马六孩小组先进经验的推广工作。在试验中，有些同志也体会到了这个先进经验的优越性。但是仅仅推广了二十天就坚持不下去了。
    推广工作为什么会失败呢？我认为关键是领导方面认为单靠技术指导就能推广先进经验，因而忽视了对工人、技术人员和基层干部的思想领导。推广先进经验是创造的先进思想和落后的保守思想的斗争。试想，在这个斗争中忽视了思想领导将会造成什么结果，从我们的推广工作中就可以看出来。
    我们在推广中，首先是学习按指示图表进行工作。工人们虽然学会了，但是运用起来总觉生疏，没有用老一套的单孔作业方法熟练。这时候，单靠技术人员对工人进行技术指导，工人们就有了不耐烦的情绪。因为他们的思想问题并没有解决，没有了解为什么要学习和推广别人的经验，因此尽管技术人员在讲，他们还留恋着老一套的作法。
    技术人员思想上也没有解决问题。他们虽然也承认马六孩小组作业方法的优越性，并能和工人在一起进行一些技术指导。但是，由于工人的思想问题没有解决，推广工作作不出成绩，他们也就不再坚持推广工作了。
    矿山的基层干部（区队长、班长、组长等），大都是从工人中提拔起来的。他们熟悉技术，但是，旧的生产方法在他们的思想中是根深柢固的。加以他们缺乏科学理论知识，因而更不能很快地接受先进经验。在他们中存在着多一事不如少一事的思想，不求有功但求无过，唯恐完不成任务或者发生事故。这样，他们自然不可能积极负责地来推广先进经验。
    从上面的情况可以看出，先进经验虽然和改进技术、提高技术不可分，但是在推广先进经验时，却不能单凭技术指导而忽视思想教育。否则，先进经验就一定不能推广。
