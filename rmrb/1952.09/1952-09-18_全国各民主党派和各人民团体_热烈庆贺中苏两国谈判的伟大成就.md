Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: China's democratic parties today issued written statements, warmly celebrating the great achievements of the Sino-Soviet government negotiations.
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: We warmly welcome and sincerely support the announcement by China and the Soviet Union regarding the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to the People's Republic of China, and the exchange of notes between the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union regarding the extension of the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base.
    The proposal of our government to extend the term for the joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base is absolutely necessary in the current situation in the East. It not only conforms to the original spirit of the Lushunkou Agreement but also to the main purpose of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The Soviet government's acceptance and agreement to our proposal proves that the Soviet Union has remained true to its obligations under the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and also proves that the Soviet Union is courageous in shouldering all responsibilities that are conducive to peace in the East and the world. There is no doubt that the sincere, selfless, and unbreakable brotherly friendship and increasing strength of the nearly 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union will be the main force for saving peace in the East and the world. We, the Chinese people, will forever work and fight together with the people of the great friendly country, the Soviet Union, in the great cause of striving for lasting world peace!
    Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said: The publication of the Sino-Soviet joint communique is a major event that thrills the entire people of China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet government has decided to transfer all property of the Changchun Railway to our government free of charge before December 31, 1952. We Chinese people know that what the Soviet Union is transferring to us is not only all the materials of the Changchun Railway, but also the most valuable technology and experience in railway transportation management. The Chinese people feel infinite excitement and gratitude for the Soviet Union's lofty and profound friendship. The Soviet government's acceptance of our government's proposal to extend the term for the joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base is definitely not solely for the benefit of China, or for the benefit of China and the Soviet Union, but for the overall plan for peace in the Far East and world peace. There is no doubt that this exchange of notes will play a great role in preventing aggression and safeguarding peace.
    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, pointed out: The important political significance of this negotiation result lies in: once again proving the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to China, and most eloquently illustrating the further consolidation and development of the Sino-Soviet alliance. He said: American imperialism is painstakingly intensifying its criminal activities to revive Japanese militarism. In order to protect our country's security and safeguard the peace and happiness of the Asian people, China and the Soviet Union must implement the main purpose of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and extending the term for the joint use of our Lushunkou Naval Base is an extremely necessary and wise measure. This not only further consolidates the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union, plays a greater role in defending peace in the East and the world, but also points out the fighting goal for the Japanese people to strive for peace.
    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: The negotiations held by the Chinese government delegation and the Soviet government fully demonstrate that the friendship and cooperation between the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union have been further consolidated and developed. The complete and unconditional transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway from the Soviet Union to our country, and the Soviet Union's acceptance of our government's proposal to extend the term of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lushunkou, greatly enhance and consolidate the invincible strength of the Sino-Soviet alliance, and will play a more important role in jointly preventing renewed aggression by Japan and other countries in collusion, and defending peace and international security in the East and the world.
    Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, said: The Sino-Soviet meeting communique not only fully demonstrates the Soviet government's infinite loyalty to the cause of the Sino-Soviet alliance and its unwavering adherence to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, but also once again proves that the Soviet Union is always willing to shoulder the heavy burden of anything that is conducive to consolidating peace in East Asia and the world and opposing wars of aggression.
    These two documents of great historical significance fully embody the common aspirations of the two peoples and are consistent with the interests of the people of East Asia and even the 1.6 billion people in the Asia-Pacific region who love peace throughout the world. It not only gives the greatest encouragement to peace-loving people all over the world, especially the 1.6 billion people in Asia and the Pacific region; at the same time, it is another heavy blow to the warmongers and their lackeys.
    Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the China Zhi Gong Party, pointed out that the release of this communique is enough to make the people of China and even the people of the world excited. He said: This communique reports the results of the negotiations in Moscow between our delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the Soviet government, and completed two major events. The victorious results of this great negotiation show that the friendly and cooperative relations between the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union are continuing to develop and consolidate. This unbreakable cooperative relationship provides a stronger guarantee for peace in the East and the world.
    Xu Deheng, person in charge of the Jiusan Society, said: On the eve of the opening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the publication of the Sino-Soviet meeting communique has more realistic political significance. The communique once again tells the world: In order to defend peace in Asia and the world, and to prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of countries colluding with Japan, the people of China and the Soviet Union must continue to fight. We warmly welcome all peace-loving people to join this battle. Let the imperialist war-mongers tremble in the face of the powerful and invincible people's strength!
    A spokesperson for the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League said: Because American imperialism still occupies our country's Taiwan, the US war of aggression against Korea still has the danger of continuing to expand, and the United States is actively arming Japan, peace and security in Asia are facing a serious threat. The announcement by China and the Soviet Union regarding the transfer of the Chinese Changchun Railway to our country and the exchange of notes between the Chinese and Soviet governments to extend the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base are powerful measures to safeguard peace in Asia and the world. It makes all peace-loving people in the world rejoice!
    The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a statement saying: After the publication of the Sino-Soviet negotiation communique, we Chinese youth are very grateful to Marshal Stalin and the Soviet people for their lofty friendship and sincere and selfless assistance to our people, and wholeheartedly support the correct measures to extend the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base. This measure will further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union, and make peace in the East and the world more secure. And for the US imperialists' attempts to prolong and expand the Korean War and the aggressive acts of collusion between the US and Japan, it will be another heavy blow.
    Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: China's people's organizations today successively issued statements, warmly supporting the communique of the Sino-Soviet talks.
    The China Peace Committee issued a statement saying: As the American aggressors continue to pursue and expand their aggressive policies in Asia and throughout the world, especially as the American aggressors attempt to prolong and expand the Korean War and step up the revival of Japanese militarism, our country's security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world are facing increasingly serious threats. Therefore, the continued strengthening of the friendly cooperative relations between the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union and the extension of the term of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lushunkou have become a powerful guarantee for maintaining peace and security in the East and preventing the aggressive forces of Japanese militarism and any country colluding with Japan from re-emerging. We express our infinite gratitude to the Soviet government and people for this warm, selfless cooperation and lofty friendship.
    The statement from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The Sino-Soviet joint communique shows that the brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is constantly developing and unbreakable. It is an important guarantee for peace in Asia and the world, and it also creates more favorable conditions for our country's national defense security and large-scale peaceful construction. The Chinese working class is determined to express its warm celebration and support with practical actions to actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and extensively carry out the patriotic production increase and thrift movement.
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation issued a statement saying: We represent women across the country in warmly supporting the Sino-Soviet meeting communique and sincerely thank the Soviet government and people for their brotherly selfless friendship and assistance. Our country's proposal to the Soviet government to extend the term for the joint use of Lushunkou is wise and correct. This not only powerfully defends our country's security, but also has extremely important significance for defending peace in the Far East and the world.
    The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation jointly issued a statement saying: The Soviet government's unconditional transfer of the jointly managed Chinese Changchun Railway to our government before the end of 1952 and its agreement with our country's proposal to extend the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base fully demonstrate the Soviet government's respect for our country's national independence and national honor, and its unlimited loyalty to the Sino-Soviet brotherly alliance. Extending the term for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Lushunkou is of great significance for preventing collusion between the US and Japanese reactionaries and defending world peace. We Chinese youth and students firmly support this important measure.
    The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued a statement saying: Our entire Chinese industrial and commercial circles, along with the people of the whole country, express warm support for the Sino-Soviet meeting communique, which has great historical significance and is inspiring. The Soviet government's agreement to our government's proposal to extend the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base powerfully demonstrates the Soviet government's infinite loyalty to the brotherly alliance between the two major powers of China and the Soviet Union and to defending lasting peace in the Far East and the world.
    The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a statement saying: We represent literary and art workers across the country in warmly celebrating the success of the Sino-Soviet talks. The announcement and exchange of notes between China and the Soviet Union on the transfer of the Changchun Railway and the extension of the term for the joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base not only conform to the interests of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also fully conform to the interests of the people of the world. It is not only related to the happiness and security of the people of China and the Soviet Union, but also to the happiness and security of the people of the world. The publication of the Sino-Soviet negotiation communique will severely strike a blow to the US imperialists' conspiracy to rearm Japan and launch a new war of aggression, and greatly encourage the confidence of the people of the world in saving peace.

    The All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularisation jointly issued a statement saying: The Sino-Soviet negotiation communique further proves that the brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is unbreakable, and it will deal a heavy blow to the US and Japanese aggressors, thereby guaranteeing peace in the East and the world. We express our high respect and gratitude to the Soviet government for its spirit of adhering to the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and actively undertaking its obligations and responsibilities for the sake of peace in the East and the world.

    The statement from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs pointed out: Due to the collusion between the US and Japanese reactionaries, peace and security in the Far East have been seriously threatened. It is absolutely necessary for China and the Soviet Union to decide to extend the term for the joint use of the Chinese Lushunkou Naval Base in accordance with the main purpose of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. We warmly support the Sino-Soviet meeting communique, and we firmly believe that the strength of the Sino-Soviet alliance will become increasingly strong, and all imperialist aggressive plans will be thoroughly shattered.

    In addition, the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society, the China People's Relief Administration, the Red Cross Society of China and other people's organizations have also successively issued statements, congratulating the success of the Sino-Soviet talks.

    热烈庆贺中苏两国谈判的伟大成就
    【新华社十七日讯】中国各民主党派今日发表书面谈话，热烈庆贺中苏两国政府谈判的伟大成就。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：我们热烈欢迎和衷诚拥护中苏关于中国长春铁路移交中华人民共和国的公告，中华人民共和国外交部部长与苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部部长关于延长共同使用旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文。
    我国政府提议将共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地的期限延长，在目前东方局势下是完全必要的，它不但与原来关于旅顺口协定的精神相一致，且与中苏友好同盟互助条约的主旨相符合。苏联政府接受并同意我国的提议，证明了苏联对于中苏友好同盟互助条约的义务信守不渝，也证明了苏联对一切有利于东方与世界和平的责任都是勇于担负的。毫无疑问，中、苏两国近七万万人口真诚无私与牢不可破的兄弟般友谊和日益强大的力量，将是拯救东方及世界和平的主要力量。我们中国人民将永远和伟大的友邦苏联人民一道，在争取世界持久和平的伟大事业中共同努力奋斗！
    中国民主同盟主席张澜说：中苏两国谈判公报的发表，是中苏两国全体人民所欢欣鼓舞的一件大事。苏联政府决定于一九五二年十二月三十一日前将长春铁路全部财产无偿地移交我国政府。我们中国人民都知道，苏联将移交给我们的不只是中长铁路的全部物资，而是最宝贵的铁道交通管理的技术与经验，中国人民对苏联这样崇高深厚的友谊，感到无限的兴奋与感谢。苏联政府接受我国政府的提议，将共同使用中国旅顺口海军根据地的限期延长这种行为绝对不是单纯地为了中国的利益，或为了中苏两国的利益，而是为了远东和平和世界和平的全盘打算。毫无疑问的，这个换文将在制止侵略、保障和平方面起伟大的作用。
    中国民主建国会常务委员会主任委员黄炎培指出：这一次谈判结果的重大政治意义在于：又一次证明了苏联对中国的大公无私的援助，最雄辩地说明了中苏友好同盟的更加巩固和发展。他说：美帝国主义处心积虑地加紧其复活日本军国主义的罪恶活动。为着保卫我国的安全，维护亚洲人民的和平和幸福，中苏两国必须贯彻中苏友好同盟互助条约的主旨，而延长共同使用我国旅顺口海军根据地的期限，正是极其必要的英明措施。这不仅更加巩固了中苏两国牢不可破的友谊，对保卫东方和世界和平发挥了更大的作用，而且给日本人民指出了争取和平的奋斗目标。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦说：中国政府代表团和苏联政府所举行的谈判，充分证明中苏两大国的友谊与合作获得了进一步的巩固和发展。中国长春铁路完全无偿地由苏联移交我国，和苏联接受我国政府提议，延长苏军从旅顺口撤退的期限，极大地增强和巩固了中苏同盟不可战胜的力量，对于共同制止日本与其他国家相勾结的重新侵略，保卫东方和世界和平与国际安全，将发挥更重大的作用。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会主席章伯钧说：中苏会谈公报不仅充分表明了苏联政府对中苏同盟事业的无限忠诚，对中苏友好同盟互助条约的信守不渝，而且是又一次证明了凡是有利于巩固东亚与世界和平，反对侵略战争的重负，苏联总是勇于担当的。
    这两个有伟大的历史意义的文件，是完全体现了两国人民的共同愿望，而且与东亚以至全世界爱好和平的人民的利益相一致的。它不仅给全世界爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民以最大的鼓舞；同时，对于战争贩子们及其走卒，是又一次沉重的打击。
    中国致公党主席陈其尤指出这一公报的发布是足以使全中国人民以至全世界人民兴高彩烈的。他说：这个公报报告了以周恩来总理为首的我国代表团和苏联政府在莫斯科谈判的结果，完成了两件大事。这伟大谈判的胜利成果，说明了中苏两国七万万人民的友好合作关系是在继续发展和巩固的。这种牢不可破的合作关系，使东方与世界和平有了更雄厚的保证。
    九三学社负责人许德珩说：在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议开幕的前夕，中苏两国会谈公报的刊布，更具有现实的政治意义。公报再一次地向全世界说明：为了保卫亚洲及世界和平，为了防止日本帝国主义的再起及与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略，中苏两国人民一定要战斗下去。我们热烈欢迎一切爱好和平的人们加入这个战斗行列。让帝国主义战争贩子在强大无敌的人民力量面前发抖吧！
    台湾民主自治同盟发言人说：由于美帝国主义还侵占着我国的台湾，美国侵略朝鲜的战争还有继续扩大的危险，美国在积极武装日本，亚洲和平和安全正遭到严重威胁。中苏关于中国长春铁路移交我国的公告和中苏两国政府延长共同使用旅顺口海军根据地期限的换文，是维护亚洲和平与世界和平的有力措施。它使全世界爱好和平的人民欢欣鼓舞！
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会发表声明说：中苏谈判的公报发表以后，我们中国青年十分感谢斯大林大元帅和苏联人民对于我国人民崇高的友谊和真诚无私的援助，并衷心拥护延期共同使用旅顺口海军根据地的正确措施。这个措施使中苏两大国的友好合作关系更加发展，使东方与世界的和平更有保障。而对于美帝国主义企图延长、扩大朝鲜战争和美日勾结的侵略行为，将是又一次的沉重打击。

    中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会联合发表声明说：苏联政府在一九五二年年底以前，将共同管理的中国长春铁路无偿地移交我国政府，并同意我国关于延长共同使用旅顺口海军根据地期限的提议，充分地表明了苏联政府对于我国的国家独立与民族荣誉的尊重，对于中苏兄弟般的同盟事业的无限忠诚。延长苏联军队从旅顺口撤退的期限，对制止美日反动派勾结进行侵略和保卫世界和平具有重大意义。我们中国青年和学生坚决拥护和支持这个重要措施。
