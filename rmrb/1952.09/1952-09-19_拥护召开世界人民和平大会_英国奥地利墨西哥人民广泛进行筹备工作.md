Xinhua News Agency, 18th dispatch: The World Peace Council's decision to convene the World People's Peace Congress continues to elicit enthusiastic responses in various countries.

In Britain, the prominent British public figures who have already been listed as responsible for organizing the British delegation to participate in the World People's Peace Congress include British Peace Committee President Pritt, Chairman Chaffe, General Secretary Jones, World Peace Council member and Secretariat Secretary Montagu, Canterbury Dean Johnson, and many famous writers, musicians, actors, and trade union leaders. The organizing committee has widely issued invitations to people from all walks of life in Britain, calling on them to participate in the World People's Peace Congress. The invitation states: "More and more people in various professions are enthusiastically seeking ways to ease international tensions. Through constructive agreements between the peoples of various countries, an agreement between governments can emerge. The initiators call on all people with various views and beliefs to discuss the issues hindering the path to peace and friendly relations, and to submit suggestions to the organizing committee so that opinions truly representative of British public opinion can be raised at the Peace Congress."

In Austria, groups of people from all walks of life have issued statements welcoming the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna. The Lower Austrian Peace Council's statement said: The selection of Vienna for this historic conference not only makes us feel honored but also makes us more responsible for intensifying the peace movement. We must do our best to publicize the purpose of this conference to the people and mobilize the people to widely discuss what measures should be taken to defend peace and strive for mutual understanding among the people of various countries. The Burgenland Peace Council held a meeting and decided to intensify the propaganda movement for peace in Austria to explain the importance of the conference to the Austrian people. The Vienna District Peace Council also passed a resolution welcoming the convening of the World People's Peace Congress.

The Mexican progressive newspaper "Mexican Voice" recently published an article calling on Mexican peace advocates to intensify their efforts to establish preparatory committees for the World People's Peace Congress. These committees will include all groups, organizations, and public leaders who are prepared to participate in the World People's Peace Congress. The article concluded: "No Mexican should be indifferent to the World People's Peace Congress; let every Mexican do their part in the work of preparing for the World People's Peace Congress!"
