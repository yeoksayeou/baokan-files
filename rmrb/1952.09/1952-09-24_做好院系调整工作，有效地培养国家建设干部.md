    Do a Good Job in Adjusting Departments and Effectively Train Cadres for National Construction
    The work of adjusting departments in national higher education institutions, focusing on North and East China in 1952, has now been basically completed. This is a major event in the history of education in New China. This is a major reform step taken for the old higher education system and teaching organization to implement the "Decision on Reforming the Education System" of the Central People's Government's Government Affairs Council, and it is also a major measure to make China's higher education serve the needs of the motherland and effectively cultivate talents for national construction. It specifically embodies the correct direction of New Democracy's education. We must make the greatest efforts to do this work conscientiously.
    The old Chinese higher education system basically served imperialism and the reactionary ruling class, and was a product of a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. The establishment of colleges and departments was blind and seriously divorced from reality. Therefore, there were repetitions in departments, dispersal of manpower and material resources, and low teaching effectiveness. In addition, the curriculum content was broad and general, and could only cultivate some so-called "generalists" who were not practical. In old China, the result of this "generalist" education was "learning is not used" and "use is not learned". Today, New China is rapidly advancing towards the road of industrialization, and we need a large number of qualified specialized talents of all kinds, especially specialized talents for industrial construction. However, the current higher education institutions are far from meeting the needs of future national construction, both in terms of quantity and quality. Therefore, if the old education system and the old higher education settings are not thoroughly adjusted and fundamentally reformed, the various construction undertakings of our country cannot proceed smoothly.
    Today's work of adjusting departments is carried out on the basis of major victories in the political reform of schools and the ideological transformation of teachers. Two years ago, the issue of adjusting departments was raised at the National Higher Education Conference, but little progress has been made in this work over the past two years. This is mainly because many teachers still have serious ideological views of worshiping British and American bourgeoisie, sectarianism, departmentalism, and individualism, and have not established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people. Therefore, they cannot well implement the New Democratic education policy. Since Chairman Mao called on intellectuals to conduct self-education and self-transformation movements at the Third Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference last year, and after the "Three-Anti" and ideological transformation movements this year, teachers in various schools have further eliminated feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, criticized bourgeois ideas, and established and strengthened the idea of serving the people. In this way, there are conditions and possibilities to do a good job in adjusting departments.
    The general policy for this national adjustment of departments is: to focus on cultivating industrial construction talents and teachers, develop specialized colleges and vocational schools, rectify and strengthen comprehensive universities, gradually establish correspondence schools and night universities, and prepare conditions in institutions for a large number of workers and peasants to enter higher education institutions. According to this policy, after adjustment, the original higher education institutions will become comprehensive universities, specialized colleges and vocational schools, respectively, and can develop in a definite direction according to the nature and tasks of each school in the future. This changes the unreasonable phenomenon of the original universities being generalized and blindly establishing schools.
    The setting of majors is the central link in the adjustment of departments and curriculum reform. The tradition of the old higher education system was to start from setting up departments and formulate courses based on the departments. The courses set up were complex and general, and it was impossible to cultivate specialized talents that meet practical needs. In this adjustment of departments, we proceed from actual needs, that is, according to the needs of national construction, to set up a certain major in order to cultivate a certain specialized talent, and to formulate a teaching plan according to the major. Each major clearly stipulates what kind of specialized talent to cultivate, and several majors with similar characteristics are combined to form a department and become a teaching and administrative unit. In this way, the purpose of our higher education institutions to cultivate a certain specialized talent is more clear, and it is fixed from the system, overcoming the chaotic phenomenon of higher education being divorced from reality, departments and disciplines being repeated, and waste of human and material resources in the past.
    In the current reform of higher education, we must fully learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The teaching plans and textbooks of various majors in the Soviet Union are basically applicable to us. It is truly scientific and closely related to reality. As for the issue of combining with China's reality, it can be gradually solved in future teaching practice. In the work of adjusting departments, teachers in various schools have conscientiously studied the Soviet teaching system and experience, and translated the teaching plans, teaching outlines, and textbooks of various majors in Soviet higher education institutions, which is very necessary. This will strengthen the practical effect of teaching and help improve China's scientific level.
    The allocation of personnel is an important issue in the adjustment of departments, and it is also the issue that every teacher is most concerned about. In old China, there was no unified and reasonable allocation of teachers at all. Since the founding of New China three years ago, in higher education institutions, except for the main administrative负责人 (responsible persons) being appointed by the government, general teachers are still freely employed professionals, and it has not been possible to achieve planned allocation. This adjustment of departments, from the setting of majors, departments, and colleges to the allocation of personnel, is carried out under a unified plan. The teachers of various schools in Beijing who participated in the adjustment of departments, in addition to being transferred to new colleges and universities to work with the setting of professional departments, teachers who were transferred to other regions and left their original positions to other schools or institutions all expressed their obedience to the organization's allocation and transfer. This is a major achievement of higher education in New China moving towards planned development in coordination with national construction. This achievement first reflects the great improvement of teachers' ideological level and political consciousness; secondly, it is due to the correct implementation of the following allocation principles: (1) The allocation of teachers should be based on the courses in the teaching plan, not on setting up courses for individuals; (2) Appropriate adjustments should be made within the country according to the needs of regions and departments; (3) Those who have difficulties in the transfer should be taken care of as much as possible; (4) Those who have difficulty working temporarily after the adjustment will stay in school to study, and their salaries will be paid as usual. After deliberating and consulting according to these principles, the personnel allocation plan was finalized, so it was supported and accepted by all teachers.
    In short, this national adjustment of departments in higher education has yielded significant gains. However, in view of the needs of the country's large-scale economic and cultural construction in the future, and the development of higher education in the future, this achievement and gain is only the beginning of a thorough reform of higher education. Many arduous tasks, such as the compilation and translation of textbooks, the improvement of teaching methods, and the training and improvement of teachers, still need to be completed by educational workers across the country with the greatest efforts. At the same time, only by doing these tasks well can higher education in the country best train enough construction talents for the country and complete its glorious mission.

### 做好院系调整工作，有效地培养国家建设干部

    做好院系调整工作，有效地培养国家建设干部
    一九五二年全国高等学校以华北和华东两区为重点的院系调整工作，现已基本完成，这是新中国教育史上的一件大事。这是为实现中央人民政府政务院“关于改革学制的决定”而对旧的高等教育制度、教学组织所采取的重大改革的步骤，也是使我国高等教育服从祖国需要、有效地培养国家建设人才的重大措施。它具体地表现了新民主主义教育的正确方向。我们必须用最大的努力，认真地把这个工作做好。
    旧中国的高等教育制度基本上是为帝国主义和反动统治阶级服务的，是半殖民地半封建社会的产物。院校的设置是盲目的，是严重地脱离实际的。因此，院系重复、人力物力分散，教学效果很低。加以课程内容广泛笼统，只能培养出一些不切合实际的所谓“通才”。这种“通才”教育的结果，在旧中国就表现为“学非所用”“用非所学”。今天新中国正在向着工业化的道路迅速迈进，我们需要大量的合格的各种专门人才，尤其是工业建设的专门人才。而现在的高等学校无论在数量上和质量上都远远不能满足今后国家建设的需要。因此，如果不对旧的教育制度、旧的高等教育设置加以彻底的调整和根本的改革，就不能使我们国家的各种建设事业顺利前进。
    今天的院系调整工作，是在学校的政治改革和教师的思想改造已经取得重大胜利的基础上进行的。两年以前，在全国高等教育会议上即曾提出了调整院系的问题，但是两年来这一工作很少进展。这主要是因为许多教师在思想上还严重地存在着崇拜英美资产阶级、宗派主义、本位主义、个人主义的观点，没有确立全心全意为人民服务的思想，因此就不能很好地贯彻执行新民主主义的教育方针。自从去年毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会第三次会议上号召知识分子进行自我教育和自我改造运动和今年经过“三反”和思想改造运动以后，各校教师进一步肃清了封建、买办、法西斯思想，批判了资产阶级思想，树立和加强了为人民服务的思想。这样，就有条件与可能把院系调整工作做好了。
    这次全国院系调整的总方针是：以培养工业建设人才和师资为重点，发展专门学院与专科学校，整顿和加强综合性大学，逐步创办函授学校和夜大学，并在机构上为大量吸收工农成份入高等学校准备条件。根据这个方针，原有的高等学校经过调整后，分别成为综合性大学、专门学院与专科学校，今后即可按照各校的性质和任务，朝着确定的方向发展。这就改变了原有大学一般化与盲目设校的不合理现象。
    专业的设置是院系调整与课程改革的中心环节。旧的高等教育制度的传统是从设系出发，根据系拟订课程，所设课程庞杂笼统，不可能培养出切合实际需要的专门人才来。在这次院系调整中则是从实际需要出发，即根据国家建设的需要，为了培养某种专门人才而设某种专业，根据专业拟订教学计划，每种专业明确规定培养何种专门人才，几种性质相近的专业合组成系，成为一个教学行政单位。这样就使我们高等学校培养某种专门人才的目的性更加明确，并从制度上把它固定下来，克服过去高等教育脱离实际、系科重复、浪费人力物力的混乱现象。
    在当前高等教育的改革工作中，我们必须充分地学习苏联的先进经验。苏联各种专业的教学计划和教材，基本上对我们是适用的。它是真正科学的和密切联系实际的。至于与中国实际结合的问题，则可以在今后教学实践中逐渐求得解决。在院系调整工作中，各校教师认真地学习了苏联的教学制度与经验，并翻译了苏联高等学校各种专业的教学计划、教学大纲和教材，这是十分必要的。这样就会加强教学的实际效果，并有助于我国科学水平的提高。
    人事的调配是院系调整工作中的重要问题，也是每个教师所最关心的问题。在旧中国根本谈不到教师的统一和合理的调配。新中国成立三年以来，在高等学校中，除了主要行政负责人由政府任命外，一般教师仍为聘任的自由职业者，也未能做到有计划的调配。这次院系调整，从专业、系科、院校的设置以至人事的调配，都是在统一计划下进行的。北京参加院系调整的各校教师，除了随着专业系科的设置调到新的院校工作外，调到外区和离开原工作岗位到其他学校或机关的教师，一致表示服从组织分配与调动。这是新中国高等教育配合国家建设走向计划化的一个重大的成就。这种成就首先反映了教师们的思想水平和政治觉悟已有很大的提高；其次是由于正确地执行了下述的调配原则，即：（一）师资调配应该根据教学计划中的课程，而不是因人设课；（二）根据地区和部门的需要，在全国范围内作适当的调剂；（三）调动中有困难者应尽可能予以照顾；（四）调整后一时难以工作者，留校学习，薪金照发。根据这些原则进行酝酿和协商，然后将人事调配方案定下来，这样就得到全体教师的拥护和接受。
    总之，这次全国高等教育的院系调整工作是有重大的收获的。但就今后国家大规模经济与文化建设的需要，和今后高等教育的发展来看，这种成就和收获还仅仅是高等教育彻底改革的一个开端。许多繁重的工作，如教材的编译，教学方法的改进，师资的培养与提高等等问题，还需要全国教育工作者继续以最大的努力来完成。同时，也只有做好这些工作，全国高等教育才能最好地为国家培养足够的建设人才，完成自己的光荣任务。
