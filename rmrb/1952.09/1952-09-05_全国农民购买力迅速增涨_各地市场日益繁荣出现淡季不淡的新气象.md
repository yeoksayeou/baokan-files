Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: The rapidly increasing purchasing power of farmers across the country has changed the perception in industrial and commercial circles that there is no good business to be done during the traditional off-season. The prosperity of primary and intermediate markets in the first half of this year particularly demonstrated the characteristic of "no off-season." Taking North China, an old liberated area, as an example: in the first half of this year, more than 1,200 small-scale materials exchange fairs were held in various parts of North China, with a total turnover of over 1 trillion yuan. The entire region sold more than 780 million catties of fertilizer, equivalent to 142 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year; about 30,000 new-style walking plows, equivalent to 164 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year; and 92,916 waterwheels, equivalent to 128 percent of the total supply for the entire year last year. In terms of consumer goods, the sales of major daily-use industrial products such as general merchandise and cloth in the first half of the year exceeded the same period last year by more than 50 percent; the sales of general merchandise in Shanxi Province in the first half of the year increased by two times compared with the same period last year. This situation shows that the purchasing power of farmers in the entire North China region has greatly exceeded that of last year.

In areas that were liberated later, the market transaction situation also showed the characteristic of rapid increase in farmers' purchasing power. For example, when Haiyan County, Zhejiang Province, held a materials exchange fair this summer, the leaders originally estimated that this exchange fair could only do 500 million yuan of business at most, but in fact, the total purchase and sales volume of farmers greatly exceeded this figure. As a result, the fair concluded with a total transaction volume of more than 1.61 billion yuan.

The Chuanwan market in Liling County, Hunan Province, is a small market town where nearby farmers sell local products and specialties and purchase industrial products. In the early days of liberation, the transaction volume of each market session was 4 to 10 million yuan. This year, the transaction volume of each market session has increased to 50 to 100 million yuan, and at its peak, it has reached 200 million yuan, reflecting the rising level of farmers' economic life. In Gaodibaozi Village, Sanqiao District, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, after only one year of land reform, farmers' purchasing power increased fivefold compared with before liberation. Gaoxing Township in Qionglai County, western Sichuan Province, is a remote area on the border of Sichuan and Kang provinces. Before liberation, the lives of farmers here were very poor. Many farmers had only one patched pair of pants for the whole family, and girls of seventeen or eighteen could not even afford clothes. There was a cloth merchant named Chen Yonggui, who bought a bolt of cloth in the autumn of 1949 and sold it in the village, while also buying a small sow to raise. By the time the small sow grew up and had piglets, more than half of his bolt of cloth remained unsold. Now, the situation in this mountain village is completely different. In the first half of this year, the township sold a lot of local products. Just from selling hemp, each farmer earned an average of 400 catties of rice. Cloth merchant Chen Yonggui can sometimes sell several bolts of cloth in a single day.

This year, farmers in various places not only bought a lot of industrial products at local materials exchange fairs, but also wanted to choose those with better quality and more beautiful designs. Taking cloth as an example, in previous years, the most popular items were coarse cloth and homespun cloth, but this year, the sales of coarse cloth and homespun cloth have decreased in many places, while bleached cloth, printed cloth, blue fine cloth, and even poplin and linen are very popular among farmers. When buying daily necessities such as towels, soap, toothbrushes, and toothpaste, farmers now prefer to buy better ones. Many farm households have hot water bottles, fountain pens, and cosmetics for girls that they have never had before... In the old liberated areas of North China, the use of bicycles by farmers is also very common.

The increase in the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers has first and foremost promoted the increasing prosperity and expansion of primary markets. Many private merchants have turned to rural areas or rural market fairs to promote the sale of goods. Products welcomed by farmers sell very quickly, and business is very good. They are pleasantly surprised to say, "Sitting in the city in the past, we really couldn't imagine that the changes in the countryside would be so great. Coming to the countryside means there's so much good business to be done!"

The increase in farmers' purchasing power and the prosperity of primary markets have already affected the changes in industry and commerce in major cities. In the first half of this year, the business situation of industry and commerce in major and medium-sized cities across the country was generally better after May than in the same period last year. At the materials exchange conferences held in major regions, the total transaction volume greatly exceeded that of last year.

Now, the autumn harvest is about to begin, and a bumper harvest of autumn crops is in sight across the country. Local financial and economic leading organs and state-owned trading departments are actively summarizing the experience of materials exchange in the previous stage, investigating the production and sales of industrial and agricultural products and farmers' purchasing power, formulating materials exchange plans for the second half of the year, and studying work on strengthening the management of primary markets, in order to launch a larger-scale materials exchange movement. Private industrialists and merchants in various places are also becoming active, and many industrialists and merchants are expanding their capital, storing materials, and improving product specifications and management methods to welcome the arrival of a more prosperous season.

    全国农民购买力迅速增涨
    各地市场日益繁荣出现淡季不淡的新气象
    【新华社四日讯】全国广大农民购买力的日益迅速增涨，使工商业界一向认为淡季没有生意好做的看法改变过来。今年上半年各地初、中级市场的繁荣情况特别显示了淡季不淡的特点。以老解放区的华北为例：今年上半年华北各地共举行小型物资交流会一千二百多次，成交总值约一万亿元以上。全区共销出肥料七亿八千多万斤，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之一百四十二；新式步犁约三万部，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之一百六十四；水车九万二千九百十六架，相当于去年全年供应数的百分之一百二十八；在生活资料方面，上半年全区销出百货、布匹等主要的日用工业品都超过去年同期百分之五十以上；山西省上半年的百货推销额比去年同期增加了两倍。这个情况表明：今年华北全区农民的购买力已经大大超过去年了。
    在解放较晚的地区，市场交易情况也一样显示农民购买力迅速增涨的特点。例如：浙江省海盐县今夏举行物资交流会时，领导方面原来估计这次交流会最多只能做五亿元的生意，可是实际上农民的购销总额大大超过这个数字，结果大会共成交了十六亿一千多万元。
    湖南省醴陵县的船湾墟场是附近农民出售土产、特产和购买工业品的一个小集镇，解放初期，每一次集期的交易额是四、五百万元到一千万元，到了今年，每一次集期的交易额已提高到五、六千万元到一亿元，最高时曾达到两亿元，这反映出农民经济生活水平的上升。陕西省长安县三桥区高低堡子村在土地改革后仅仅经过一年的时间，农民购买力就比解放前增加了五倍。四川省西部的邛崃县高兴乡，是川、康交界的一个偏僻地区，解放以前，这里的农民生活非常穷困，许多农民全家只有一条打过补钉的裤子，十七、八岁的大姑娘还穿不上衣服。当地有一个名叫陈永贵的布商，他在一九四九年秋天买回一匹布到村里来卖，同时买进一头小母猪来养，等到小母猪长大了并且生了小猪的时候，他的那匹布还剩下半匹多未卖完。现在，这个山乡的情形完全不同了，今年上半年该乡卖出很多土产，单是卖麻，平均每个农民就收入了四百斤大米，布商陈永贵有时一天就能卖出几匹布。
    今年各地农民不但在当地的物资交流会上买进了很多工业品，而且他们还要挑选那些质量比较好的、漂亮的东西。拿布匹来说，往年各地最行销的是粗布、土布，可是今年有许多地方，粗布、土布的销数减少了，而漂白布、花布、蓝细布甚至府绸、麻纱之类，却很受农民欢迎。农民们现在买毛巾、肥皂、牙刷、牙膏等日用品，都喜欢买好些的，很多农家有了从未有过的热水瓶、自来水笔和姑娘们用的化妆品……。在华北老解放区，农民使用自行车也很普遍了。
    广大农民购买力的提高，首先促使初级市场日益繁荣与扩大，许多私商转向农村或农村集场去推销货物，为农民所欢迎的货销得飞快，生意非常好。他们惊喜地说：“过去坐在城里，真想不到农村里的变化这样大，下乡来有这么大的生意好做！”
    农民购买力的增涨，初级市场的繁荣，已经影响了大城市工商业的变化。今年上半年全国各大中城市的工商业的营业情况，五月份以后大部比去年同期好。在各大地区举行的物资交流大会上，交易总额都大大超过去年。
    现在，秋收即将开始，全国的秋季作物丰收在望，各地财经领导机关和国营贸易部门正在积极地总结前一阶段物资交流的经验，调查工业品、农产品的产销情况和农民购买力，制订下半年的物资交流计划，研究关于加强初级市场的管理等工作，以便开展一个更大规模的物资交流运动。各地私营工商业者也活跃起来，不少工商业者正在扩大资金，储备物资，改进产品规格和经营方法，迎接更加繁荣的季节的到来。
