　　In July, during the busy season of weeding, I arrived with excitement at Renhe Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, the location of the "Model Farmer Spare-time School." The surrounding lush green fields, the village's tidy houses, and the newly paved yellow sand road all presented a new atmosphere.

　　In the past, this was a poor village where 97.8% of the village's more than 30 hectares of land did not belong to poor farmers; landlords and rich peasants owned more than 80% of the more than 160 livestock. Every household couldn't afford enough to eat or wear. Which family's children could step into the school gate? After the land reform, the village's appearance completely changed. Everyone organized and cooperated with each other, developing production. The lives of the farmers gradually became prosperous. The whole village of 160 households raised 300 cattle and horses and bought 14 large rubber-wheeled carts. Farmers generally lived above the middle-peasant level. Each household could regularly eat rice and flour, and everyone had two sets of winter and summer clothes. Women and children wore brightly colored clothes, and they proudly said, "We have truly turned ourselves around. If you don't believe it, please come here and see!"

　　Learning has become their habit. No matter how busy the farm work is or how bad the weather, when the clear bell rings in the evening, young adults and women take their books and hurry to school. The old women also organized "炕头 (kang head) groups" to study. Liu Suqin, a mother of two, became a model student. After cleaning up in the evening, she reads under the lamp. In the December 1950 county-wide test, 12 women in the village received "Thousand-Character Certificates"; 33 could recognize 800-900 characters. They received "Cultural Certificates" in the 1950 and 1951 county-wide tests, and five were selected as learning models.

　　However, they always felt that the farmer spare-time school could not meet their needs and hoped to learn faster and recognize more characters to read books.

　　On June 14th, word spread in the village: The Provincial Department of Culture and Education would begin piloting the rapid literacy method in the village. Everyone was extremely happy to hear this news and busily prepared learning supplies. Women's Director Liu Guizhi braved the heavy rain to buy stationery at a store three miles away. Each village was also busy repairing blackboards and preparing tables and benches; some spare-time schools' classrooms installed large glass windows and pasted the ceilings neatly. Everyone seemed extraordinarily busy, as if welcoming a great happy event.

　　Everything was ready. People eagerly waited for the start of school. Some impatient people anxiously said, "The work team has been here for several days, why hasn't school started yet!" Some women who lived at their mothers' homes said they didn't want to go back and were determined to stay and study. Fu Guizhen's husband's family was in Changtu County, Liaoxi Province. She originally planned to go back in early July but didn't want to leave. She said, "It's really difficult for people who can't read. My husband works outside. Every time he sends a letter, I have to ask someone else to read it. If they're not home, I have to wait a few days. It's really frustrating!" Tian Suyuan also discussed it with her husband and stayed at her mother's house to participate in the study.

　　The day of the start of school finally arrived, and everyone became nervous. The sound of loud reading could be heard everywhere in the village. Even the elderly and children who didn't participate in the study mumbled "勹、攵、冖..." or hummed the song "Cultural Great Leap Forward." Women gathered together to study whenever they had time. After dinner, one by one, they took their books and walked to the vicinity of the street blackboard newspaper, forming a large circle and reading aloud. Many women practiced writing with chalk on the stove, pot, and water tank while cooking. Look, everywhere—on windows, doors, walls…—were crooked phonetic symbols. Because Pei Yuzhi was held back by her young children and couldn't find time to study, she came up with a clever idea. She took out the only set of Chinese chess in her house, pasted phonetic symbols on it, and played with the children while reading. Fu Guizhen recited pinyin letters while sewing soles; Wang Yaxian, afraid of delaying work, cut up cardboard, wrote phonetic symbols on it, hung it around her neck, and recited while working.

　　During the study, each group demonstrated the spirit of mutual assistance. Sun Suqin, the leader of the women's study group in Renhe Village, feared that her group would fall behind, so she helped others whenever she had time so that they would have time to study. One day, she went to Tang Xiuqin's house and saw that Xiuqin was busy cooking, so she helped cook. Zhang Suqin learned slowly, so she helped take care of the children and do odd jobs. Du Guizhen taught her husband to read while eating.

　　To enable mothers with children to participate in the study with peace of mind, the old women were organized to lead the children; contact was also made with the elementary school to mobilize 21 elementary school students to take care of the children after class, allowing the mothers to find time to study. Grandma Sun of Shengli Village was truly enthusiastic. She automatically proposed to the mothers, "I will take care of the children. You study hard!" Fearing that the care would not be adequate, she called her niece to help her. Someone asked Grandma Sun, "Old lady, why are you so enthusiastic?" She replied, "Studying has a schedule, and we can't delay it! If we don't study now, when will we! In the past, people without money couldn't afford to go to school, let alone women."

　　Perhaps some people will doubt: Will studying delay production? However, the facts are not so. Studying promoted production. In the past, only two women in Shengli Village regularly went to the fields. After studying, the number of women going to the fields increased to eight, and even Liu Guiyun, who didn't like to work, went to the fields.

　　Renhe Village is a microcosm of China's new countryside. We believe that in the near future, the vast rural women will acquire the necessary cultural knowledge and become an important force in national construction.

    一个掀起了文化学习热潮的新农村
    ——访吉林省蛟河县仁和村
    王廷珍
    七月里正是铲趟紧张的时节。我怀着兴奋的心情到了吉林省“模范农民业余学校”的所在地——蛟河县仁和村。周围葱绿的山田，村里整洁的房屋和新铺的黄砂道，都呈现了新的气象。
    过去，这里是一个穷庄子，全村三百多垧土地的百分之九十七点八不属于贫苦农民；牲畜一百六十多头，地主、富农的就占了百分之八十多。家家都吃不上、穿不上，谁家的孩子能踏进学校的大门呢？土地改革以后，村子的面貌完全改变了。大家都组织起来，实行互助合作，发展了生产。农民的生活逐渐富裕起来了。全村一百六十户养着牛马三百头，还买了十四台大胶皮车。农民普遍过着中农以上的生活，每一户经常可以吃到大米和面粉，每人都制备了冬夏衣服各两套；妇女和小孩都穿着花布衣裳，她们自豪地说：“我们真正翻身了，谁若不信，请到这里来看看吧！”
    学习已成为她们的生活习惯，无论庄稼活怎样忙，天气如何恶劣，当晚间清脆的钟一响，青壮年妇女们都拿着书急急忙忙地走向学校。老太太们也组织了炕头小组，进行学习。有两个孩子的母亲刘素琴，学习当了模范，她在晚间收拾干净后便在灯下看书。一九五○年十二月全县进行了测验，全村有十二名妇女得了“千字证”；能认八、九百字的有三十三人，她们在一九五○、一九五一年全县测验中都得了“文化证”，有五名被选为学习模范。
    但是，她们总觉得农民业余学校远远不能满足自己的要求，希望学得快些，多识字能看书。
    六月十四日，村里传开了：省文教厅要在村里开始重点试行速成识字法。大家听到这个消息以后，高兴极了，都忙着准备学习用具。妇女主任刘桂芝冒着大雨到三里地外的铺子里买文具。各屯也忙着修理黑板，准备桌子和凳子；有的业余学校的教室，装上了大玻璃，把顶棚糊得整整齐齐的。大家显得忙碌异常，好像迎接大喜事似的。
    一切都准备好了。人们眼巴巴地等待着开学的日子。有些不耐烦的人都着急地说：“工作团来了好几天啦，怎么还不开学呢！”有些住在娘家的女人，说什么也不想回去了，坚决要留下学习。傅桂珍的婆家在辽西省昌图县，她原来打算在七月初回去，也不想走了。她说：“不识字的人真是困难。男人在外边工作，每次来信都得找别人看，如果人不在家还得等几天，可真急死人！”田素媛也和男人商量好以后，留在娘家参加学习。
    开学的日子终于到来了，大家都紧张起来。村里到处可以听到响亮的念书声，就是没有参加学习的老年人和孩子们也叨咕着“勹、攵、冖……”，或者哼着“文化大翻身”的歌子。妇女们一有空就聚在一起学习。晚饭后一个个拿着书向街上黑板报附近走去，围成一个大圆圈就念起来了。好多妇女在做饭烧火时也拿着粉笔在灶门上、锅台上、水缸上练习写。你看吧，在窗上、门上、墙上………到处都写着歪歪曲曲的注音符号。裴玉芝因为有小孩子牵累，不能抽时间学习，她急中生智，把家里仅有的一副象棋拿出来，贴上注音符号，一边念，一边哄着孩子玩。傅桂珍纳着鞋底时也在念拼音字母；王亚贤怕耽误活，将硬纸剪开，写上注音符号，挂在手脖上，一边做活一边念。
    在学习中，各小组发挥了互助的精神。孙素琴是仁和屯的妇女学习小组长，怕本组落后，一有空就去帮助别人使她们有时间进行学习。有一天她去唐秀琴家，见秀琴正忙着做饭，她便去帮着做饭菜；张素琴学习较慢，她就帮着看管孩子、做零活。杜桂珍在吃饭时一边吃一边教男人念。
    为了使有孩子的母亲能安心地参加学习，把老太太组织起来，带领孩子们；并和小学校方面取得联系，动员二十一名小学生在课后看管小孩，让母亲们抽时间学习。胜利屯的孙老太太真是热心极了，她自动地向母亲们提出：“我来照管孩子，你们好好学习吧！”怕照顾不周到，她又把侄女叫来帮助她。有人问孙老太太：“老大娘，你为什么这样热心呢？”她回答道：“学习是有钟点的，可不能耽误呀！现在不学习，还等什么时候！过去，没有钱的人那能念得起书，女的更不用说了。”
    也许有人要怀疑：学习会耽误生产。但是，事实却不然，学习推动了生产。胜利屯过去只有两个妇女经常下地，经过学习以后，下地的妇女增加到八人，就连不爱劳动的刘桂云也下地了。
    仁和村是中国新农村的一幅缩影。我们相信，在不久的将来，广大的农村妇女将获得必需的文化知识，成为国家建设的重要力量。（附图片）
