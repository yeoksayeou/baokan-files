    Reply from the Medical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government

    The opinions raised by the Health Section of the Anyang County People's Government are correct, and similar opinions have been raised in other places in the past. This issue has been resolved recently after discussions with the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government. The Ministry of Finance of the Central Government has issued interpretations regarding the regulations on exempting hospitals and clinics from industrial and commercial taxes. The following two points are relevant to the opinions raised by the Health Section of the Anyang County People's Government:

    First, for general clinics without hospital beds (including some dental and ophthalmology hospitals), if they meet other tax exemption conditions, they may be temporarily allowed tax exemption.

    Second, for doctors who practice medicine and also run traditional Chinese medicine shops in rural areas (excluding county towns or market towns), if they meet the other two tax exemption conditions, the medicine they sell to patients who seek medical treatment may also be exempted from tax, and only the portion of medicine sold to non-patients will be taxed.

    According to the interpretation of the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government, the tax exemption standards for hospitals and clinics have been relaxed. Local health authorities must strengthen the management of hospitals and clinics to ensure that private hospitals and clinics effectively fulfill their obligations for epidemic prevention, healthcare, and wartime service, charge fees according to the prescribed standards, and appropriately stipulate the amount of free outpatient and inpatient care. This will be more beneficial to the development of people's health and healthcare.

    中央人民政府卫生部医政处的答复
    安阳县人民政府卫生科所提的意见是正确的，过去其他地方也提出过类似意见。这一问题经与中央财政部研究后，最近已获得解决。中央财政部已对医院诊所免征工商业税的规定有所解释，其中与安阳县人民政府卫生科所提意见有关的有以下两点：
    一，对于一般无病床设施的诊所（包括部分牙科、眼科医院），如已具备其他各项免税条件者，可暂准予免税。
    二，农村中（不包括县城或集镇）开业的医师兼营中药铺者，如具备其他两条免税条件时，其对就诊病人所售之药亦可准予免税，只对非就诊病人售药部分征税。
    根据中央财政部的解释，对于医院诊所的免税尺度已经放宽了。各地卫生机关必须加强对于医院诊所的管理，使私人医院诊所切实履行防疫、保健和战勤义务，按照规定标准收费，以及适当规定门诊、住院的免费额。这样才会更有益于人民卫生保健事业的开展。
