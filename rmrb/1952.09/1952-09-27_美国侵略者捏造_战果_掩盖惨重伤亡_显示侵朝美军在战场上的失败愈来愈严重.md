　　Xinhua News Agency, September 26th: American aggressors are increasingly relying on shrinking US military casualty figures and fabricating "glorious battle results" to cover up their failures on the Korean battlefield. This self-deceiving tactic shows that the failures suffered by the American aggressors are becoming more and more serious.
    
    In July and August this year, Clark implemented a series of so-called "new strict security" measures at the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo to prevent the truth about the disastrous defeat of the US military on the Korean battlefield from being leaked. It is well known that in August alone, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies killed or wounded 10,816 US soldiers. However, if the figures of weekly US military casualties released by the US Department of Defense from July 30 to September 3 are added up, there are only 2,987, and the remaining 7,829 are thrown into the "confidential wastepaper" basket where the truth is not allowed to be leaked by US Department of Defense officials. A US military officer in Korea frankly said in the August 8th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" that the published small casualty figures were only a "symbol" of the huge losses suffered by the US military. He said that as a result of a battle in a small area alone, a US battalion suffered about 150 casualties and lost several tanks. And his battalion was killed and wounded 35 people by the artillery of the Korean and Chinese forces in three days before the battle even started. The August 3rd issue of the American "New York Daily" also said: "Official communiques refer to the activities of the infantry on the front line as 'minor'. But for the soldiers in combat, it is not minor. They are fighting fiercely in rows and companies to seize several yards of land. Soldiers are still being killed constantly."
    
    Regarding the fabrication of battle results by American aggressors, Robert Miller, a reporter for the United Press, wrote in the New York "Compass" on August 11: "Many of the things and news that are published now are indeed pure fiction." Robert Miller said that last fall he followed a squadron of naval aircraft to raid North Korea. It was said that the "battle results" were the burning of three vehicles and the damaging of eight vehicles, but the squadron publicized the destruction of 54 vehicles of the Korean and Chinese armies. In the bulletin of the Fifth Air Force of the US Air Force in Korea, the results of this attack were written as 673 destroyed vehicles, exaggerating it exactly sixty times. Robert Miller said: "If you count the number of vehicles destroyed and damaged in the night raids we have announced over the past year, you will find that the total will far exceed the total number of vehicles now in the East." This American journalist also revealed that the headquarters of the US Fifth Air Force had taken pictures of the bridges near Daejeon, South Korea, that were destroyed by the US military during the retreat in the early days of the war, and publicized them as the "battle results" of the US aircraft's attack on North Korea.
    
    Van Fleet, the commander of the Eighth Army of the US military in Korea, once admitted to the trick of fabricating battle results. According to the same United Press reporter Robert Miller, last fall Van Fleet publicly admitted at a meeting of troop commanders: if he believed the casualty figures of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies estimated by his troop commanders, "then there should not be a single living Chinese or Korean fighting us now." Van Fleet said that the "battle results" he released in the name of the Eighth Army headquarters were also "exaggerated."
    
    The recent battle for several hilltops southeast of Kimhwa on the central front, called "Gyeonggi Mountain" and "Finger Ridge" by the enemy, once again proved that the American aggressors are covering up their heavy casualties by fabricating battle results. On the evening of the 6th, the Korean and Chinese People's Armies, with the cooperation of fierce artillery fire, captured these two enemy positions and annihilated three entire platoons of the defending enemy. In the following days, the enemy continuously counterattacked these two hilltops, using a total force of more than one regiment, attacking more than 30 times, but each time they suffered heavy casualties under the fierce artillery fire of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies. By the 14th, the enemy had been killed or wounded more than 1,500 people. United Press reporter Panden reported on the tragic state of the enemy casualties, saying that the artillery shells of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies "made the trenches leading to Gyeonggi Mountain look like a strange graveyard. The arms, legs, and heads of the killed Republic of Korea soldiers were piled up like mountains." However, the same United Press fabricated on the 13th: "The communists have suffered about 4,000 casualties." This is the embarrassing situation of the American aggressors covering up their defeats and deceiving themselves.
    
    People can once again draw the conclusion from the propaganda of American generals covering up their failures that the more the American aggressors tout their "great victories" and "glorious battle results," the more disastrous the failures they suffer.

### 美国侵略者捏造“战果”掩盖惨重伤亡  显示侵朝美军在战场上的失败愈来愈严重

    美国侵略者捏造“战果”掩盖惨重伤亡
    显示侵朝美军在战场上的失败愈来愈严重
    【新华社二十六日讯】美国侵略者已愈来愈依靠缩小美军伤亡数字和捏造美军“辉煌战果”的办法，来掩盖它在朝鲜战场上的失败。这种自欺欺人的手法显示美国侵略者遭受的失败已愈来愈严重。
    今年七、八月间，克拉克曾经在东京的联军总部实行了一连串的所谓“新的严格的保密”措施，以免把美军在朝鲜战场上的惨败真相泄露出来。人们都知道，仅在八月份一个月中，朝中人民军队就毙伤了美军一万零八百十六名。可是如果把美国国防部在七月三十日到九月三日中所发表的每周美军伤亡名单的数字加起来，却只有二千九百八十七名，其余七千八百二十九名，就都被美国国防部官员丢进不准泄露真相的“机密废纸”篓里去了。一个侵朝美军军官在八月八日的“美国新闻与世界报道”上坦率地说，发表的那些渺小的伤亡数字只不过是美军遭受巨大损失的“象征而已”。他说，仅仅在一个小地区一次战斗的结果，美军一个营就伤亡了一百五十人左右，还损失了几辆坦克。而他所在的一个营，还没有作战就被朝中部队的大炮在三天内打死打伤了三十五人。八月三日的美国“纽约日报”也说：“官方公报把战线上的步兵活动称做是‘轻微的’。但对于作战的兵士而言，并不是轻微的。为了夺取数码土地，他们成排成连地进行猛烈的战斗。兵士们仍然正在不断地被杀。”
    关于美国侵略者的捏造战果，美国合众社记者罗拔·米勒曾在八月十一日的纽约“指南针报”上写道：“现在有许多刊载出来的事情和新闻，实际上的确纯粹是虚构。”罗拔·米勒说，去年秋天他曾随一队海军飞机到北朝鲜偷袭，据说这次“战果”是焚毁了三辆车，击伤了八辆，可是这个飞机队却宣传毁损朝中军队的车辆五十四辆，而在美侵朝空军第五航空队的公报上，更把这次袭击的战果写成毁车六百七十三辆，恰恰夸大了六十倍。罗拔·米勒说：“假使你统计一下过去一年来我们所宣布的夜袭中毁伤车辆的数字，你就会发现总数将远超过现在在东方所有的全部车辆数字。”这个美国新闻记者还透露美国第五航空队司令部曾把南朝鲜大田附近在战争初期美军撤退时自己破坏的桥梁拍成照片，把它当做美机出击朝鲜北部的“战果”来宣传。
    侵朝美军第八军军长范佛里特曾经承认过捏造战果的勾当。据同一个合众社记者罗拔·米勒透露：去年秋天范佛里特在一次部队指挥官的会议上公开承认：如果他相信他的部队指挥官所估计的朝中人民军队的伤亡数字，“那么现在就应该没有一个活的中国人或朝鲜人和我们作战了。”范佛里特说他以第八军司令部的名义发表的“战果”也是“夸大的”。
    最近在中部战线金城东南被敌人称为“京畿山”“指头岭”的几个山头上所进行的争夺战，再一次证明美国侵略者以捏造战果来掩盖其惨重伤亡。朝中人民军队六日傍晚在猛烈炮火配合下夺得了这两处敌军阵地，歼灭了守敌三个整排。在此后的几天中，敌军不断向这两处山头进行反扑，使用兵力总计一个团以上，攻击达三十多次，但每次都在朝中人民军队猛烈炮火的阻击下遭到重大伤亡，到十四日止，敌军已被杀伤一千五百名以上。合众社记者潘登报道这次敌军伤亡的惨状说：朝中人民军队的炮弹“把通向京畿山的战壕搞得像一块奇形怪状的墓地。被击毙的大韩民国士兵的手臂、腿和头颅堆积如山。”然而，同一个合众社却在十三日捏造说：“共军已有四千名左右的伤亡。”这就是美国侵略者掩盖败绩自欺欺人的窘相。
    人们可以从美国将军们掩盖失败的宣传中再一次地得出这样的结论，就是：美国侵略者越是鼓吹其“伟大胜利”和“辉煌战果”，他们遭受的失败就越是惨重。
