The draft directives of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) regarding the Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union (Fifth Five-Year Plan) for 1951-1955 stipulate further raising the cultural level of the Soviet people. Total investment in the construction of schools, libraries, clubs, cinemas, and other cultural and educational institutions will increase by 50 percent compared to the previous five-year plan period.

Currently, new theaters are being built on a large scale, and theaters destroyed during the war are being repaired. Last year, a musical comedy theater was completed in Riga, and the "Estonia" Theater, which also includes a concert hall, was completed in Tallinn. A drama theater recently opened in Stalingrad. A new drama theater in Batumi is nearing completion. The interior and exterior of this theater are decorated with Georgian national motifs, and it includes a corridor overlooking the coast. A theater has been built in Kalinin, with three levels of seating in the main hall, ornate drawing rooms, and a stage equipped with modern equipment. The architecture of this theater harmonizes with the ancient Russian style of the city.

"Literary Gazette" reported that more than twenty theaters are currently under construction in many cities in the Soviet Union. A drama theater will soon be built in the center of Petrozavodsk (Karelian-Finnish Republic). The construction of the Kazan Opera and Ballet Theater, which was suspended during the war, has now resumed. This theater will be completed next year and can accommodate 1,200 people. The Sukhumi Drama Theater will soon be completed. A magnificent building now stands on the site of the theater in Sevastopol, which was destroyed by the fascist invaders. New theaters are also being built or repaired in Ashgabat, Frunze, Stalino, and other Soviet cities. The designs for theaters in cities such as Kaluga and Poltava have been approved.

Cities that previously had no theaters, such as Nizhny Tagil, Zaporozhye, and Ulan-Ude, will now have theaters. In Ulan-Ude, the capital of the Buryat-Mongol Republic, the construction of the new theater is nearing completion and will open this year.

The new Five-Year Plan stipulates that dozens more theaters will be built in central cities and the most remote cities.

    苏联各地纷纷建筑剧院
    苏联共产党（布尔什维克）第十九次代表大会关于一九五一年——一九五五年苏联发展五年计划（第五个五年计划）的指示草案，规定要进一步提高苏联人民的文化水平。在建筑学校、图书馆、俱乐部、电影院和其他文教机关方面的投资总额将比前一个五年计划期间增加百分之五十。
    目前正在大规模地建筑新的剧院和修建在战争期间被毁坏了的剧院。去年，里加落成了一个音乐喜剧院，塔林落成了一个“爱沙尼亚”剧院，该院并附设一个音乐厅。斯大林格勒最近有一个话剧院开幕。巴统有一个新话剧院即将完工。这个剧院的内部和外部都用格鲁吉亚民族形式的彩饰来装饰，并且附带可以俯览海岸的走廊。加里宁城已经建好了一个剧院，正厅里的座位有三层，设有华丽的大客厅和带有现代设备的舞台。这个剧院的建筑跟这个城市的古代俄罗斯风格是调和的。
    “文学报”报道：苏联许多城市目前正在建筑二十多个剧院。彼得罗萨佛德斯克（卡累利阿—芬兰共和国）市中心即将建筑一个话剧院。战争期间一度中止的喀山城歌舞剧院的建筑工程现已恢复。这个剧院明年完工，可以容一千二百人。苏虎米的话剧院不久即将完工。塞瓦斯托波尔城被法西斯侵略者毁坏了的剧院的旧址上现在又矗立起一座壮丽的建筑物。阿什哈巴德、伏龙芝、斯大林诺以及其他苏联城市也在新建或修建剧院。卡卢加、波尔塔发等城剧院的设计图样都已批准。
    从前没有剧院的城市，如下塔吉尔、萨坡罗什和乌兰乌达，现在也将有剧院了。在乌兰乌达——布利亚蒙古共和国的首都，新剧院的建筑即将完工并将在今年开幕。
    新五年计划规定还要在中心城市和最偏僻的城市建筑几十个剧院。
