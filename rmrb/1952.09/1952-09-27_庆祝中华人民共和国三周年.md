    Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the People's Republic of China
    Maurice Thorez, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party

    Salute to the Chinese Revolution! Three years ago, on October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed amidst the cheers of working people around the world. The French working people expressed heartfelt joy at the victory of this great nation that had just won liberation.

    Today, three years after the people have taken power, the People's Republic of China has become very consolidated, and Mao Zedong's wise and decisive national democratic policy is invincible. This is an international event of the most profound and decisive significance. It can be said that this marks a turning point in history, and the future of Asia and even the entire world will be affected.

    We, the French Communists and all progressive people in our country, are delighted that the Chinese people have finally succeeded and warmly congratulate them on the third anniversary of their liberation. We firmly believe that the new China will never again be a humiliated country, as people used to say. The Chinese people have forever broken free from the shackles of imperialism. They have won democratic freedom in a great struggle; they have given land to the tillers; they have made women equal to men in all aspects, restoring women's dignity. In this vast land, people used to have no opportunity to be educated; but now, thousands upon thousands of schools are being established. They plan to turn China into an intelligent and highly educated country. The resources related to the national economy and the people's livelihood have become the property of the people, and China will soon enter the ranks of the world's major industrial countries. It is not difficult to understand why the Central People's Government in Beijing is loved, respected, and unconditionally trusted by its great people.

    The French working people are very happy from the bottom of their hearts for all the amazing achievements, accomplishments, and progress of the Chinese people who have now mastered their own destiny.

    The names of Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Zhou Enlai—the three great leaders of the People's Republic of China—have long been known to the French Communists and progressive people.

    Our people warmly praise them. Whenever our people talk about them, they think of the heroic Chinese army that has suffered great sacrifices, and they cannot help but feel awe for the great Chinese Communist Party, workers, and peasants. We have always been concerned about their thirty years of arduous struggle and amazing progress with great excitement and a sense of shared fate. How excited we were when we heard the glorious epic of the superhuman Long March of 12,000 kilometers from Jiangxi to Shaanxi! In the ten years after that memorable retreat, Mao Zedong and his comrades patiently consolidated the organization of the Chinese Communist Party. In the cave dwellings of Yan'an, they planned an anti-Japanese war that could not be taken lightly and that would change the face of the world. In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek and the Americans thought they could finally crush the barrier of the Communist Party. They fought with huge military and financial power for three years, but the ending was a fatal failure. Has there ever been a precedent in history for the people to win victory so quickly against such a powerful enemy?

    In less than three years, the great Chinese people have dealt a crushing blow to those American multi-millionaires who clamored to conquer China and the world, and won their freedom. Mao Zedong's People's China has won the great honor of severely hitting these evil plans.

    As early as 1949, the American writer Lippmann correctly foresaw the direction of the situation. He wrote at that time: The United States is suffering an irreparable defeat in China.

    All glory to the People's China, which is celebrating this great victory today.

    In October 1917, the vast Tsarist empire collapsed, giving way to the Soviet Republic of Lenin and Stalin. In October 1949, Mao Zedong's People's China followed the example of the Soviet Union and established the people's power in one of the largest countries in the world.

    Progressive men and women all over the world pay tribute to these two powerful countries, which were the first to open up the path to a truly civilized future for all mankind.

    庆祝中华人民共和国三周年
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员　加香
    向中国革命致敬！三年以前，一九四九年十月一日，中华人民共和国在全世界劳动人民的欢呼声中宣告成立了。法国劳动人民对于这个刚刚赢得解放的伟大民族的胜利，曾经表示衷心欣慰。
    今天，在人民掌握政权三年以后，中华人民共和国已经非常巩固，毛泽东英明果敢的民族民主政策无往而不胜。这是一件影响最深远、最有决定意义的国际大事。可以说，这标志着历史的转折点，亚洲甚至整个世界的前途都要受到影响。
    我们法国共产党人和我国全体进步人民都因为中国人民终于成功而欢欣鼓舞，并且热烈地祝贺他们赢得解放的三周年纪念。我们深信：新中国永远不再是一个被侮辱的国家，像人家过去所说的那样。中国人民已经永远挣脱了帝国主义者的镣铐。他们已经在伟大的斗争中赢得民主自由；他们使耕者有其田；他们使妇女在一切方面都和男子居于平等地位，恢复了妇女的尊严。在这个辽阔广大的国土上，人民从前没有受教育的机会；而现在，成千成万的学校正在建立起来。他们计划把中国变成一个有智慧的、有高度教养的国家。关系国计民生的富源已经成了人民的财产，中国很快就会进入世界大工业国的行列。这就不难明白，在北京的中央人民政府为什么得到它伟大的人民的热爱、尊重和毫无保留的信任。
    法国劳动人民对于现在已经掌握了自己命运的中国人民的一切惊人成就、一切成绩和进步，都从心里感到非常高兴。
    毛泽东、朱德和周恩来——中华人民共和国这三位伟大领袖的名字，早就为法国共产党人和进步人民所熟知。
    我国人民热烈赞颂他们。我国人民每逢谈到他们的时候，就想起了曾经遭受过巨大牺牲的英雄的中国军队，就不禁对伟大的中国兄弟党、工人和农民肃然起敬，我们一直怀着非常激动和休戚与共的心情关切着他们三十年来艰苦的斗争和惊人的进步。当我们听到了从江西到陕西一万二千公里超人的长征这首光荣的史诗时，我们心里是多么激动啊！就在那次值得纪念的退却以后的十年里，毛泽东和他的战友们耐心地巩固了中国共产党的组织。在延安的窑洞里，他们计划着改变世界面貌的不可轻侮的抗战。一九四六年，蒋介石和美国人以为他们终于可以粉碎共产党这个屏障了。他们拚出了巨大的军事力量和财政力量来打仗，打了三年，结局却是致命的失败。人民对这样强大的敌人作战，却能那样迅速地赢得胜利，难道历史上有过这样的先例吗？
    在不到三年的时间里，伟大的中国人民给了那些口口声声说要征服中国和世界的美国巨万富翁以一蹶不振的打击，赢得了自己的自由。毛泽东的人民中国获得了狠狠打击这些罪恶计划的伟大荣誉。
    早在一九四九年，美国作家李普曼就正确地预见到局势的发展方向。他那时写道：美国正在中国遭到无可挽救的失败。
    一切光荣归于今天正在庆祝这个伟大胜利的人民中国。
    一九一七年十月，庞大的沙皇帝国崩溃，让位给列宁和斯大林的苏维埃共和国。一九四九年十月，毛泽东的人民中国追随着苏联的榜样，在世界上一个最大的国家里建立了人民的政权。
    全世界爱好进步的男女都向这两个首先给全人类开辟了未来真正文明的道路的强大国家致敬。
