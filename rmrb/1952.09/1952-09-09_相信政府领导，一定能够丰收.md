    Believe in the Leadership of the Government, Sure to Have a Bumper Harvest
    Editor: This year is a year of bumper harvest. The crops in our Beiwang Township are better than in previous years. My 1.2 mu of high-yield field yielded 10 dan and 1 basket of unhusked rice. After drying and weighing, the average yield per mu was 1,021 jin, an increase of more than 36% compared to previous years. This is the first time in my life I have seen such a good harvest. My high-yield field is second-class land, so why can it still have a yield of over 1,000 jin? I think: First, it all depends on the leadership of the Party and the government. This year, the work team patiently helped me break my conservative thinking, enabled me to accept Li Chenggui's advanced high-yield experience, and also helped me formulate a 1,000-jin high-yield plan and improve farming techniques. Second, I kept a close watch on the seasons. This year, I was the earliest in the township to transplant rice seedlings, and I also trampled the fields and tended the seedlings earlier than others. From the beginning of spring plowing to now, I have been accumulating a cart of fertilizer in the city every morning. During the slack season, I spend the whole day accumulating fertilizer, so my high-yield field has a particularly sufficient amount of fertilizer. Third, organization played a big role in achieving high yield. This spring, I had not yet joined a mutual aid team and only temporarily exchanged labor with others, which solved my difficulty of not having an ox. By the time of the second weeding, I was even more convinced of the benefits of organization, so I formed a mutual aid team with others. In the autumn, our mutual aid team did a fast and good job in tending the seedlings, planting beans, and accumulating fertilizer.
    In short, the main reason I can achieve a high yield of 1,000 jin is that I believe in the government and accept the leadership of the work team. I often think, the Volunteer Army is fighting in Korea, giving us a happy and peaceful life. Are there any difficulties we cannot overcome in achieving high yields in the rear?

    相信政府领导，一定能够丰收
    编辑同志：今年是一个丰收年。我们北望乡的庄稼都比往年好；我的一亩二分丰产田，打了十担零一箩毛谷，晒干过秤，平均每亩合一千零二十一斤，比往年增产百分之三十六强。这是我有生以来头一次见到的好收成。我这丰产田是二等田，为什么还能有千斤以上的产量呢？我认为：第一、全靠党和政府的领导。今年工作组耐心帮助我打破了保守思想，使我接受了李呈桂的先进丰产经验，还帮助我订了千斤丰产计划，改进了耕作技术。第二、我对季节抓得紧。今年插秧我是全乡最早的，踩田扮禾都比别人早。从春耕起到现在，我每天早上到城里积一车肥料，农闲时我更是整天积肥，因此我的丰产田上的肥料特别足。第三、组织起来对丰产起了很大作用。今年春天我还没参加互助组，只和别人临时换工互助，就已解决了我没有耕牛的困难。到耘二道田时，我更相信了组织起来的好处，于是和别人组成了互助组。在秋季扮禾、种豆、积肥中，我们互助组做得又快又好。
    总起来说，我能作到千斤丰产的主要原因是相信政府，接受工作组领导。我常想，志愿军在朝鲜作战，使我们过幸福安乐的日子，我们在后方搞丰产，难道还有不能克服的困难吗？
