    Glorious Labor, Happy Life
    Pei Lan
    What is family life like for collective farmers in a socialist country? This is a question of universal concern to farmers in our country. The Chinese Farmers' Delegation visited the homes of various collective farm members in the Soviet Union and found answers to all kinds of questions about the family life of collective farmers.

    Labor is Glory, Labor is Happiness
    Mo Ri Ge Ce, a model agricultural worker from Inner Mongolia, and Lian Cheng, a farmer representative, said: We solved many problems when we visited the Stalin Collective Farm in Taldy-Kurgan Oblast, Kazakhstan. All the farm members greeted them with the utmost cordiality. Nu Lie Ma Bie Dao Fu, a sixty-six-year-old farm member, a Socialist Labor Hero, and a Communist Party member, slaughtered a sheep in accordance with the Kazakh custom of entertaining distinguished guests to treat his Chinese friends from afar. The delegates were invited to his home to attend the banquet. Nu Lie Ma Bie Dao Fu told the delegation about his life experience, which explained the source of the happy life of Soviet farmers. Before 1930, he worked for wealthy peasants. Of course, life was very hard at that time. After the revolution, collective farms began to be organized here in 1930, and he joined the farm. He started growing sugar beets in 1934 and served as the head of the sugar beet production team. He is a skilled sugar beet grower. In 1947, the state stipulated that the standard yield of sugar beets per hectare was 500 to 800 quintals. Two hectares of his team’s sugar beets yielded 1,998 quintals, and another five hectares yielded 550 quintals. Therefore, he was selected as a Socialist Labor Hero and awarded the Gold Star Medal. In 1948, his team again overfulfilled the production task, harvesting 867 quintals of sugar beets per hectare on three hectares of land. As a result, he received a Order of Lenin. The following year, he received a second Order of Lenin. He went to Moscow twice and saw Stalin. He said with great enthusiasm: "I am a Kazakh. In the Tsarist era, I never dreamed of going to Moscow. In the Stalin era, I became a Socialist Labor Hero and received the highest honor of the Soviet Socialist Republics Union. For the sake of Comrade Stalin, I will continue to work hard to increase sugar beet production." From this, the farmers' representatives of our country saw that in socialist countries, labor is glory and labor is happiness.

    Nu Lie Ma Bie Dao Fu introduced the income and expenditure of his family to the delegates. His family has four people - husband and wife and two children. The children are all in school. Last year, the couple worked 700 workdays, distributed 1,854 kilograms of wheat, 2,788 rubles, 859 kilograms of sugar, two sheep, five quintals of wood, one ton of hay, and one ton of wheat straw. He invited the delegates to visit his steel wire bed, carpets, radio, various toys for the children, and many newspapers and magazines he subscribed to. He said that he has two very beautiful leather overcoats, and his wife has three, "because women should dress beautifully." In addition to the public property of the collective farm belonging to everyone, he also has a lot of personal property: a small vegetable garden, a large horse, a small horse, a dairy cow, a calf, ten sheep, five geese, fifteen chickens, and a small jeep. The small vegetable garden is planted with various fruit trees and vegetables. He hoped that the delegates would stay for a few more days, and when the fruits ripened, he would invite the delegates to have a feast.

    Lu Hongbin, a model agricultural worker from Shandong Province, Lian Cheng, a farmer representative from Inner Mongolia, and Mo Ri Ge Ce, a model agricultural worker from Inner Mongolia, all said: We have heard that Soviet farmers live a happy life, but we didn't know what it was like. This time, we saw it with our own eyes.

    Zhao Huaiyi and Zhao Zhongyi, model agricultural workers from Henan Province, said: After visiting several farm members' families, we still wondered if the life of a Socialist Labor Hero was of course affluent, but the lives of ordinary farm members might not all be good! Later, we visited the families of ordinary farm members, and these farm members solved this problem for us.

    Zhang Xuexiu, a model agricultural worker from Pingyuan Province, said: "I originally thought, is it possible that every farm member lives very well? Once, we went to the Budyonny Collective Farm for a visit. It was dark and raining, and we couldn't go back to the station to stay. The farm divided our forty-odd people into forty-odd families to stay. The next morning, we asked each other: 'How is the family you stayed in?' The answers were similar. This completely dispelled the doubts."

    Zhao Huaiyi, a model agricultural worker from Henan Province, initially saw that the male and female farm members were dressed so well, and thought to himself: They are entertaining guests, how could they not wear new clothes? Later, he saw that the farm members working in the fields were all dressed very well, and realized that he was wrong. Zhao Huaiyi said: I met an old man in a collective farm who was repairing a tractor, wearing greasy clothes. I said, "Don't you have good clothes?" He said, "I am working now; when I rest, you definitely won't recognize me." This time I completely understood that every farmer in the Soviet Union works well, dresses well, and eats well.

    Not Afraid of Having Many Children
    Yu Shanjiao, a model agricultural worker from Hebei Province, said: "If farmers in our village have more children, the couple will inevitably have some small disagreements. The more children people (referring to Soviet collective farm members) have, the better the country takes care of them." He said that they visited the families of several Heroine Mothers. Ali Yeva, a member of the Stalin Collective Farm in Badar District, Azerbaijan, is forty-eight years old this year and has seven children. She is a Glorious Mother and a Socialist Labor Hero, and her husband is the vice chairman of the farm. Her eldest son is studying at the Azerbaijan Agricultural Technical School, her second son is studying veterinary medicine at the Kirovabad Medical College, her third son is a member of the collective farm, and the rest are either studying at school or in the farm's nursery. She has many children and takes good care of them, so she received the Medal of Heroine Mother; the state also gives her 300 rubles per month as a maternal maintenance fee. The farm also subsidizes her two eldest sons with 60 workdays per month because of their excellent academic performance at school. She and her husband and third son work particularly well. Her family received a reward of 2,300 workdays last year, distributing 43,200 rubles and 15,160 kilograms of grain.

    In order to welcome Chinese friends, she specially brought the children back from the nursery. She said that she bought four steel wire beds, two sewing machines, three carpets, four pairs of leather shoes, and many silk clothes last year. She is now preparing bricks, tiles, and wood to build a house for her second son to get married.

    The delegates visited Ali Yeva's kitchen. The kitchen was filled with her everyday food: milk, bread, beef, eggs, sugar, and soda. The kitchen was very clean, and she cooked with an electric stove.

    Zhao Huaiyi said: In the past, I heard people say that in the socialist era, children would be handed over to the public to raise them, and they would not recognize their parents when they grew up. This time, after visiting the Soviet Union, I realized that it was not the case at all. People send their children to the nursery in the morning and pick them up after work. Zhao Zhongli said: "The Stalin Collective Farm has five nurseries. We saw many small beds, but no children. We asked why there were no children. The comrades in the nursery said: 'It is raining today, and the mothers did not go to the fields and took the children back.' We also asked: The farm members send their children at six o'clock in the morning and pick them up in the evening. What about those who live far from the nursery? The comrades in the nursery said that every farm member has a vehicle: a small motorcycle, a carriage, or a car, which is very convenient for picking up and dropping off children."

    Not Afraid of Old Age, Not Afraid of Sickness
    Zhang Xuexiu said: Before I went to the Soviet Union, I often thought: In a socialist society, it is easy to handle young people who can work, but how do old people live? This time, after visiting the collective farms in the Soviet Union, I saw with my own eyes that old people live just as well, and my problem was completely solved. The husband of Alata Yelekova (38 years old), a member of the Lenin Collective Farm in the Kirov District of Taldy-Kurgan Oblast, Kazakhstan, was sacrificed in the Great Patriotic War, leaving her, her 78-year-old mother-in-law, and three children. The children are all in school, and she is the only one who participates in labor. She is the leader of the sugar beet production team. Last year, she earned 590 workdays (including the workdays earned by her eldest son during his vacation), distributing 12 quintals of grain, 1,440 rubles in cash, and 147 kilograms of sugar. She herself has 0.25 hectares of homestead land, a dairy cow, a mare, and 21 sheep. Because they are the families of martyrs, the state pays her mother-in-law a pension of 100 rubles per month. Her home also has carpets, radios, and other equipment. She has won two medals, one for high sugar beet yield and one for being a model producer in the Great Patriotic War. The old woman specially instructed the members of the delegation: "After you go back, be sure to tell the Chinese farmers that they should know how Stalin cares for us."

    The delegates saw the lives of the elderly in the Soviet Union who could not work, and had a further understanding of the Soviet social system. The Soviet state stipulates that men over the age of 55 and women over the age of 50 can stop working and their lives are provided by the state. Old people could have spent a happy old age in leisure, but except for the sick and disabled who could not work at all, no old person was willing to rest. The delegates saw an old farm member in his eighties at the Asya Fulo Collective Farm in the Desert River District of Azerbaijan. According to state regulations, he should have retired long ago; the general meeting of all farm members also decided not to let him participate in labor, but the farm subsidized him with 200 rubles and 32 kilograms of grain per month. The old man smiled and said to the delegates that these living allowances could not be used up by two people. The old farm member, who was 74 years old, who was watching the gate of the fourth production team of the Stalin Collective Farm in Taldy-Kurgan Oblast, Kazakhstan, was decided by the general meeting of collective farm members to rest two years ago. He rested for a year and felt very bored. He insisted on asking the farm for work. The general meeting of farm members allowed him to watch the gate on the farm, and he could get his own workdays every month and also get a pension. At this time, the delegates asked him: "Are you still afraid of losing things in the collective farm?" He said: "Watching the gate is not to watch people, but to watch the weather and watch the magpies. The farm members have all gone to work in the fields, and there are clothes, quilts, and grains drying outside. I take care of them to avoid getting wet in the rain or being ruined by the birds." Many farm members said to the delegates: In the Soviet Union, people are not afraid of getting sick. Minor illnesses can be treated free of charge at the collective farm's clinic or small hospital; serious illnesses can be treated at the well-equipped district hospital; if the patient cannot afford the medical expenses, the farm will fully provide them. During the treatment period, the farm also gives the patient half of his original remuneration according to the size of his labor force.

    The farmer representatives solved a series of ideological problems during this visit, saw their future, and saw clearly the path that our country's farmers should take. Li Shunda, a model agricultural worker, said: In the Soviet Union, everyone lives so happily, without any distress or sorrow. In the fields, in the cars, in the clubs, there are songs and laughter everywhere. When I return to the village, I will definitely let the young people learn to entertain themselves. Only by being able to entertain themselves and rest well can they work better.

    光荣的劳动，幸福的生活
    培蓝
    在社会主义国家里，集体农民的家庭生活到底是个什么样子？这是我国农民普遍关心的一个问题。中国农民代表参观团在苏联访问了各种各样的集体农庄庄员的家庭，找到了关于集体农民家庭生活的各种疑问的答案。
    劳动就是光荣，劳动就是幸福
    内蒙农业劳动模范莫日格策、农民代表廉成说：我们访问卡查赫共和国塔尔达库尔干州斯大林集体农庄时，解决了好多问题。那个农庄的全体庄员以最高的盛情迎接他们。六十六岁的老庄员、社会主义劳动英雄、共产党员努列马别道夫按照卡查赫族招待贵宾的礼节，特地杀了一只羊，款待远道而来的中国朋友。代表们被接到他的家里参加盛宴。努列马别道夫向代表团介绍了他的身世。他的经历，说明了苏联农民的幸福生活的来源是什么。他在一九三零年以前给富农作活，当然，那时候生活是很苦的。革命以后，这里从一九三零年开始组织集体农庄，他参加了农庄。他从一九三四年开始种甜菜，担任甜菜生产小组长。他是一个种甜菜的能手。一九四七年国家规定每公顷甜菜的标准产量为五百公担到八百公担，他这一组的甜菜，有两公顷收获了一千九百九十八公担，另外有五公顷都收获了五百五十公担。因此，他被选为社会主义劳动英雄，荣获金星奖章。一九四八年，他的小组又超额完成生产任务，在三公顷土地上，每公顷收获八百六十七公担甜菜。他因此得到一个列宁勋章。第二年得到了第二个列宁勋章。他曾两次去莫斯科，看见了斯大林。他兴致勃勃地说：“我是卡查赫族人，在沙皇时代，作梦也到不了莫斯科。在斯大林时代，我成了社会主义劳动英雄，得到苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高的荣誉。为了斯大林同志，我要继续努力提高甜菜产量。”我国农民代表们从这里看到了：在社会主义国家，劳动就是光荣，劳动就是幸福。
    努列马别道夫向代表们介绍了他的家庭的收支情况。他家共有四口人——夫妻俩和两个孩子。孩子都在学校读书。去年他们夫妇两人做了七百个劳动日，分得一千八百五十四公斤小麦，二千七百八十八个卢布，八百五十九公斤糖，两只羊，五公担木料，一吨干草，一吨麦秸。他请代表们参观了他的钢丝床、地毯、收音机、孩子的各种各样的玩具和他订阅的许多书报杂志。他说，他有两件很漂亮的皮大衣，他的妻子则有三件，“因为妇女是应该穿得漂亮些的。”除了集体农庄的公共财产是属于大家的以外，他还有许多个人财产：一个小菜园、一匹大马、一匹小马、一头乳牛、一头小牛、十只羊、五只鹅、十五只鸡、一辆小吉普车。小菜园里种着各种果树和蔬菜。他希望代表们多住几天，那时候果子熟了，他要请代表们饱餐一顿。
    山东省农业劳动模范吕鸿宾、内蒙农民代表廉成、内蒙农业劳动模范莫日格策都说：过去听说过苏联农民生活很幸福，但不知道是什么样子，这次可亲眼看到了。
    河南省农业劳动模范赵怀义、赵中义说：我们访问了几个庄员家庭以后，心里还想，社会主义劳动英雄的生活当然是丰裕的，一般农庄庄员的生活，怕不一定都好吧！后来我们又访问了一般庄员的家庭，这些庄员给我们解决了这个问题。
    平原省农业劳动模范张学修说：“我原先也想，是不是每个庄员生活都很好呢？有一次，我们到布琼尼集体农庄参观，天黑了又下着雨，不能回车站上去住了。农庄就把我们四十多个人分到四十多家去住。第二天早上互相问问：‘你住的那一家怎么样？’回答都差不多。这就把疑问彻底扫除了。”
    河南省农业劳动模范赵怀义起先看到男女庄员穿的都那么好，心里想道：他们招待客人，还能不穿件新衣裳？后来看见在田间工作的庄员都穿得很好，才知道自己想错了。赵怀义说：我在一个集体农庄遇见一个老汉，正在修理拖拉机，穿着一身油腻的衣服，我说：“你难道没有好衣服吗？”他说：“我现在是在工作；到休息的时候，你保险不认识我了。”这一下我彻底明白了，苏联每个农民都是劳动得好，穿得好，吃得好的。
    不怕孩子多
    河北省农业劳动模范郁善交说：“我们村里庄稼人的孩子多了，两口子难免闹个小蹩扭，人家（指苏联集体农庄庄员）孩子越多，国家照顾得越好。”他说，他们参观了几个母亲英雄的家庭。阿塞拜疆巴达尔区斯大林集体农庄庄员阿里耶娃，今年四十八岁，生了七个孩子。她是光荣母亲和社会主义劳动英雄，丈夫在农庄当副主席。她的大儿子在阿塞拜疆农业技术学校学习，二儿子在基罗巴特区医学院学兽医，三儿子是集体农庄的庄员，其余的有的在学校读书，有的在农庄托儿所里。他生的孩子又多，照管的又好，因此得到母亲英雄的奖章；每个月国家还给三百卢布，作为母亲保养费。农庄因为她那两个大儿子在学校成绩优良，每月给他们补助六十个劳动日。她们夫妇两人和三儿子劳动得特别好，她家去年得到两千三百个劳动日的报酬，分了四万三千二百卢布，一万五千一百六十公斤粮食。
    她为了迎接中国的朋友，特地把小孩子从托儿所接回来了。她说，她去年一年买了四架钢丝床，两架缝衣机，三条地毯，四双皮鞋和许多绸缎衣服。她现在正准备砖瓦、木料，要修房子，给二儿子结婚。
    代表们参观了阿里耶娃的厨房，厨房里摆着她的家常食物：牛奶、面包、牛肉、鸡蛋、糖和汽水。厨房非常清洁，她做饭是用电炉子。
    赵怀义说：过去听人讲说在社会主义时代，孩子生下来就要交给公家养活，长大了也不认识爹妈。这次在苏联参观，才知道完全不是那么回事。人家早晨把孩子送到托儿所，工作完了就接回来。赵中礼说：“斯大林集体农庄有五个托儿所，我们看见很多小床，可是没有孩子。我们问为什么没有孩子？托儿所的同志说：‘今天下雨，母亲们不上地，把孩子都接回去了。’我们又问：庄员早晨六点钟送孩子，晚上接回去，离托儿所远的怎么办？托儿所的同志说，每个庄员家里都有车子：小摩托车、马车或者汽车，接送孩子非常便当。”
    不怕老，不怕病
    张学修说：我没有到苏联以前，心里常常想：在社会主义社会，年青人能劳动，怎么也好办，老年人怎样生活呢？这次参观苏联的集体农庄，亲眼看到老年人过得一样好，我的问题完全解决了。卡查赫共和国塔尔达库尔干州基洛夫区列宁集体农庄庄员阿拉太列克娃（三十八岁）的丈夫在卫国战争中牺牲了，家里剩下她、七十八岁的老婆婆和三个孩子。孩子都在学校念书，只有她一个人参加劳动。她是甜菜生产小组长，去年得了五百九十个劳动日（包括大儿子假期劳动所得的劳动日），分了十二公担粮食，一千四百四十个卢布现金，一百四十七公斤糖。她自己有○·二五公顷宅旁园地，一头乳牛、一匹母马、二十一只羊。因为她们是烈士家属，国家每月发给她婆婆一百个卢布的抚恤养老费。她家里同样有地毯、收音机等设备。她得过两次奖章，一次是甜菜丰产奖章，一次是卫国战争生产模范奖章。老婆婆特别嘱咐代表团团员们说：“你们回去以后，一定要告诉中国的农民朋友，让他们知道斯大林是怎样关心我们的。”
    代表们看到苏联的不能劳动的老年人的生活，对于苏联的社会制度有了进一步的认识。苏联国家规定，男人在五十五岁以上，女人在五十岁以上，就可以不再劳动，生活由国家供给。老年人原可以安闲地度过幸福的晚年，但是，除了病弱残废根本不能劳动的以外，没有一个老年人愿意休息。代表们在阿塞拜疆沙漠河区阿司阿夫罗集体农庄看到一个八十多岁的老庄员，按照国家规定，他早该休息了；全体庄员大会也决定不让他参加劳动，而由农庄每月补助他二百个卢布，三十二公斤粮食。老头笑着和代表们说，这些生活补助，两个人也用不完。卡查赫共和国塔尔达库尔干州斯大林集体农庄第四生产队看门的老庄员已有七十四岁，前年集体农庄庄员大会决定他必须休息。他休息了一年，心里闷得很，一定向农庄要求工作。庄员大会让他在农庄看门，每月得到自己的劳动日，还能得到养老金。这时，代表们问他：“在集体农庄，还怕丢东西吗？”他说：“看门不是为了看人，是为了看天气、看野鹊。庄员都下地干活了，外边晒着衣服、被子、粮食，我照看着，以免下雨淋湿或被鸟儿蹧蹋。”许多庄员对代表们说：在苏联，人们是不怕害病的。小病可以在集体农庄的诊疗所或小医院免费治疗；重病可以到设备完善的区医院治疗；病人如果无力负担医疗费，农庄完全供给。在治病期间，农庄还按照病人原来的劳动力的大小，给他一半报酬。
    农民代表们在这次参观中解决了一系列的思想问题，看见了自己的未来，看清了我国农民应走的道路。农业劳动模范李顺达说：在苏联，每个人生活得都是那么愉快，没有一点苦闷，没有一点忧愁。在田地里、汽车上、俱乐部中，到处都是歌声和笑声。回到村里，我一定让年青人学会娱乐，会娱乐，会休息，才能更好地劳动。
