    Nationwide Reorganization of Higher Education Institutions Basically Completed
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] To meet the urgent needs of national construction and implement the "Decision on Reforming the Education System" of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, the large-scale reorganization of higher education institutions nationwide in 1952 has now been basically completed. As a result, a new landscape has emerged in higher education throughout the country. This reorganization of departments and faculties is a major measure to reform the old higher education system and teaching organization in a planned and step-by-step manner, and it is also a major event of revolutionary significance in the history of education in New China.
    This nationwide reorganization of higher education institutions focused on the North China and East China administrative regions, making more comprehensive adjustments. The North China region focused on Beijing and Tianjin, and after the adjustment, there are a total of 41 universities and colleges in the region. The East China region focused on Shanghai and Nanjing, and after the adjustment, there are a total of 54 universities and colleges in the region. Peking University and Nankai University in the North China region have become comprehensive universities, while Tsinghua University and Tianjin University have become multi-disciplinary higher industrial schools. Beijing Normal University and Fu Jen Catholic University have been adjusted to become new normal universities, and the names of Fu Jen Catholic University and Yenching University have been abolished. At the same time, specialized colleges such as Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Forestry College, Beijing Institute of Mechanized Agriculture, Central University of Finance and Economics, and Beijing College of Political Science and Law have been newly established in Beijing. Fudan University, Nanjing University, and Shandong University in the East China region have become comprehensive universities, while Zhejiang University and Nanjing Institute of Technology have become multi-disciplinary higher industrial schools. At the same time, institutions such as East China Institute of Chemical Technology, East China Institute of Water Conservancy, East China Institute of Aeronautics, and East China Institute of Physical Education have been newly established. The names of Ginling College in Nanjing, Cheeloo University in Shandong, and St. John's University, University of Shanghai, and Aurora University in Shanghai have been abolished. Northeast People's University in the Northeast region has been changed to a comprehensive university, and new institutions such as Northeast Institute of Geology, Northeast Forestry College, and Shenyang Agricultural College have been established. Sun Yat-sen University in the Central South region has become a comprehensive university, and the names of Lingnan University, South China United University, and other schools have been abolished. Chongqing University in the Southwest region has been changed to a multi-disciplinary higher industrial school, and new institutions such as Chongqing Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture and Chongqing Institute of Chemical Industry have been established. In addition, Xinjiang August First Agricultural College has been newly established in the Northwest region. Currently, faculty, staff, and students in higher education institutions across the country are enthusiastically and happily engaging in this reform movement of people's higher education.
    The general policy of this adjustment is: to focus on training industrial construction cadres and teachers, develop specialized colleges and vocational schools, consolidate and strengthen comprehensive universities, gradually establish correspondence schools and night universities, and systematically reassign worker-peasant rapid middle schools to various higher education institutions as preparatory classes, so as to absorb a large number of students with worker and peasant backgrounds into higher education institutions. Specialized colleges and vocational schools are divided into multi-disciplinary and single-disciplinary types. Their task is to train various specialized senior technical personnel according to the needs of the country. The task of comprehensive universities is mainly to train scientific research talents and teachers for secondary schools and higher education institutions. After this reorganization, higher education in our country can be closely integrated with national construction, changing the past phenomenon of education being divorced from reality and the duplication of departments and faculties.
    In this adjustment work, all schools have made full preparations. In the North China region, the preliminary plan for the reorganization of higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin was largely determined in the spring. Therefore, ideological mobilization began at the end of June. Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, first made a mobilization report to more than 1,000 teachers from higher education institutions in Beijing and Tianjin, giving a comprehensive explanation of the principles of departmental and faculty adjustment, curriculum reform, and personnel allocation. Under the direct leadership of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Institutions Reorganization Office was established, and preparation committees were successively established in various schools. Under the leadership of the Beijing-Tianjin Higher Education Institutions Reorganization Office and the preparation committees of various schools, teachers actively engaged in various activities and preparations in order to better unite and complete the reorganization work and welcome the establishment of new schools, such as holding get-togethers and seminars, giving the reorganization work a good start. The first step in the reorganization of departments and faculties was the establishment of majors and departments and the formulation of teaching plans. The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government widely solicited opinions from various parties. After careful research and repeated discussions, many teachers deeply appreciated the superiority of the Soviet teaching plans, and a wave of learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union was universally launched in various schools. Various schools invited Soviet experts and professors to hold seminars. Tsinghua University invited professors who had returned from Harbin Institute of Technology to introduce the experience of Harbin Institute of Technology in learning from the Soviet teaching system. Peking University held a conference to exchange心得 on studying the Soviet teaching system, and also translated dozens of teaching plans and syllabuses for various majors in Soviet higher education institutions. Teachers from Tsinghua University and Peking University also organized "Russian Intensive Courses" during this summer vacation, exploring some experience in learning Russian intensively. At present, the personnel allocation work of various institutions in the North China region has been basically completed, and the allocation of school buildings and equipment has also been determined according to the specific situation, and the relocation work is underway. Other regions have also been actively carrying out this work in accordance with the spirit of this nationwide reorganization of departments and faculties.
    After the majors and departments were determined, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government carried out a unified allocation of teachers according to the needs of the teaching plans of various majors in various schools. More than 130 teachers from Peking University and Tsinghua University were transferred to other schools and regions. Due to sufficient preparation and the universal improvement of teachers' ideological awareness after the "Three-Anti" and ideological reform movements, after the mobilization report explained the principles of personnel allocation and proposed preliminary allocation plans for the schools to deliberate, the teachers unanimously believed that the allocation plans were reasonable and expressed their obedience to the allocation and transfer. On September 13, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government held a reception for the transferred teachers. Minister Ma Xulun, Vice Ministers Qian Junrui and Zeng Zhaolun, and those in charge of various schools expressed their congratulations on the achievements of this reorganization of departments and faculties. The transferred teachers expressed their obedience to the allocation and happily embarked on new jobs.

    全国高等学校院系调整基本完成
    【本报讯】为了适应国家建设的迫切需要，实现中央人民政府政务院“关于改革学制的决定”，一九五二年全国高等学校大规模的院系调整工作现已基本完成。因而全国高等教育已出现了新的面貌。这次院系调整工作是有计划、有步骤地改革旧的高等教育制度、教学组织的一个重大措施，也是新中国教育史上一件具有革命意义的大事。
    这次全国高等学校院系调整工作是以华北、华东两大行政区为重点，做较全面的调整。华北区以北京、天津为重点，调整后全区共设四十一院校；华东区以上海、南京为重点，调整后全区共设五十四院校。华北区的北京大学、南开大学成为综合性的大学，清华大学和天津大学成为多科性的高等工业学校，北京师范大学和辅仁大学调整成为新的师范大学，辅仁大学、燕京大学校名撤销。同时在北京新设北京地质学院、北京钢铁工业学院、北京航空工业学院、北京林学院、北京机械化农业学院、中央财经学院、北京政法学院等专门学院。华东区的复旦大学、南京大学和山东大学成为综合性的大学，浙江大学和南京工学院成为多科性高等工业学校。同时新设华东化工学院、华东水利学院、华东航空工业学院、华东体育学院等院校。南京的金陵大学、山东的齐鲁大学、上海的圣约翰大学、沪江大学、震旦大学等校名撤销。东北区的东北人民大学改为综合性大学，同时新设东北地质学院、东北林学院、沈阳农学院等院校。中南区的中山大学成为综合性的大学，岭南大学、华南联合大学等校校名撤销。西南区的重庆大学改为多科性高等工业学校，同时新设重庆土木建筑学院、重庆化学工业学院等院校。此外西北区新设新疆八一农学院。目前全国各地高等学校的师生员工都以积极愉快的心情，投入这一人民高等教育事业的改革运动。
    这次调整的总方针是：以培养工业建设干部和师资为重点，发展专门学院和专科学校，整顿和加强综合性大学，逐步地创办函授学校和夜大学，将工农速成中学有计划地改属各高等学校，作为预备班，以便大量吸收工农成份的学生入高等学校。专门学院和专科学校又分多科性和单科性两种，它的任务是根据国家的需要，培养各种专门的高级技术人才。综合性大学的任务，主要是培养科学研究人才和中等学校、高等学校的师资。经过这次整调后，我国高等教育即可以和国家建设密切结合，改变过去教育和实际脱节及院系重复的现象。
    在这次调整工作中，各校都进行了充分的准备工作。华北区因北京天津高等学校院系调整的初步方案在春季即已大体确定，因此自六月底便开始了思想动员，中央人民政府教育部钱俊瑞副部长首先向北京天津高等学校教师一千余人做了动员报告，对院系调整、课程改革、人事调配的原则做了全面的说明。并在中央人民政府教育部的直接领导下成立了京津高等学校院系调整办公室，各校也先后成立了筹备委员会。在京津高等学校院系调整办公室和各校筹备委员会的领导下，各校教师们为了更好地团结起来完成院系调整工作，迎接新学校的建立，都积极地从事各种活动和准备工作，如举行联欢会、座谈会等，使院系调整工作有了良好的开始。院系调整的第一步骤是专业和系科的设置与教学计划的制定，中央人民政府教育部曾广泛征求了各方面的意见。经过慎重研究反复讨论，许多教师都深切地体会了苏联教学计划的优越性，各校普遍掀起了学习苏联先进经验的热潮。各校请苏联专家与教授举行座谈会。清华大学请哈尔滨工业大学回来的教授介绍哈尔滨工业大学学习苏联教学制度的经验，北京大学举行学习苏联教学制度的心得交流大会，同时并翻译了苏联高等学校几十种专业的教学计划与教学大纲。清华大学、北京大学的教师并在今年暑假中组织了“俄文速成班”，摸索出一些学习俄文速成的经验。目前华北区各院校的人事调配工作已基本完成，校舍设备调配亦已根据具体情况确定，迁移工作正在进行。其他各地区亦已根据中央这次院系调整工作的精神，积极进行中。
    专业系科的设置确定后，中央人民政府教育部根据各校各种专业教学计划的需要，进行统一的师资调配。北京大学、清华大学两校调至外校和其他地区的教师达一百三十余人。由于准备工作充分，教师的思想觉悟在“三反”与思想改造运动后普遍提高，经过动员报告说明了人事调配的原则，提出初步调配方案交各校酝酿，教师们一致认为调配方案合情合理，表示服从分配和调动。九月十三日中央人民政府教育部举行了外调教师的招待会，马叙伦部长，钱俊瑞、曾昭抡副部长及各校负责人都为这次院系调整工作的成就表示慰勉。外调的教师则表示服从分配愉快地走上新的工作岗位。
