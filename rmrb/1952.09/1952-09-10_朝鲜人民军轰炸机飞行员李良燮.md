    Li Liangxie, Bomber Pilot of the Korean People's Army
    Ji Dong
    Like many pilots of the Korean People's Army, Li Liangxie is a brave and young air force fighter. He is twenty-four years old this year and was originally a worker in a chemical factory. When the Korean War for the Liberation of the Fatherland began, he served as a heavy machine gunner in the infantry, and was later transferred to receive short-term flight training, becoming an excellent air force pilot.
    For more than two years, Li Liangxie has gloriously completed dozens of flight combat missions in his bomber. He has flown night bombing missions to attack the enemy behind enemy lines on several occasions, making great contributions to the motherland. He has successively won two Second-Class Orders of Freedom and Independence and one Third-Class National Flag Order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    Of his many flight battles, the bombing of Kimpo Airfield was a glorious sortie. Kimpo Airfield is an outpost base for the U.S. invasion of Korean air force, and U.S. planes often intrude into the rear of the Korean People's Army from there to kill and set fires. The Korean people issued a call to their heroic air force fighters: "Destroy Kimpo Airfield and destroy the enemy planes there!"
    On the eve of New Year's Day in 1952, there was no moon, no clouds, only stars twinkling in the night sky. At an airfield in northern Korea, a squadron of bombers took off with the deafening sound of engines, flying south.
    Li Liangxie, the faithful son of the Korean people, led his bomber squadron, carrying the hatred of millions of people, flew towards Kimpo Airfield over high mountains, rivers, forests, and towns. There were several fires rising on the ground, and the incendiary bombs dropped by the U.S. air pirates were destroying peaceful villages and towns again. In the roar of the engines, Li Liangxie and his comrades seemed to hear the cries of millions of suffering people: "Avenge us, kill the American bandits severely!" The pilots clenched their lips, accelerated their speed, and bravely cut through the night sky and flew forward. Before long, they had flown over the lower reaches of the Han River, and Kimpo Airfield was right in front of them.
    The enemy at the airfield seemed to have noticed the arrival of the Korean People's Army bomber squadron, and they shone searchlights into the night sky, and two night fighters took off to guard the sky, but their airfield was still brightly lit. The Korean People's Army bomber formation bravely continued to fly towards the brightly lit airfield, and the pilots suddenly shut down their engines and glided silently over the airfield. After Li Liangxie spotted the enemy planes parked on the airfield, he immediately issued a combat order to the formation. He pushed the control stick forward, leading the formation to dive from high altitude, accurately dropping large quantities of bombs on the enemy's planes and airfield warehouses, and then strafing fiercely with machine guns. Violent explosions erupted at the airfield, with thick smoke and fire rising.
    After completing the bombing mission, the bomber formation crossed the Han River and returned to base. At this time, the enemy's anti-aircraft guns were still firing in a panic.
    For the sake of the motherland and General Kim Il-sung, and to avenge their brothers and sisters, every pilot of the Korean People's Army fought regardless of their own safety. On one occasion, the wing of the bomber piloted by Li Liangxie was damaged by enemy aircraft during the advance, but he still bravely completed the combat mission and flew back to base with victory.
    That was on the night of June 27, 1951, when he and his comrades were ordered to bomb a group of U.S. invading army tanks concentrated on the road from Yeoncheon to Jeonkok-ri. During the flight, they encountered an attack by enemy night fighters. While bravely fighting back against the enemy planes, Li Liangxie ordered his wingmen to fly at low altitude, get rid of the enemy planes, and continue to advance rapidly. At this moment, he suddenly felt his plane's speed slow down and its altitude decreasing - the plane's wing had been damaged. At this time, the barbaric bombing atrocities of the U.S. air pirates and the tears of the people of the motherland longing for revenge flashed in Li Liangxie's mind, and he immediately made up his mind: "Even if I am smashed to pieces, I will complete the combat mission!" He skillfully got rid of the enemy's attack and flew forward with difficulty in his wounded plane, finally catching up with his wingmen.
    The enemy tanks, with red and green lights on, were densely parked in the valley and on the road. Li Liangxie was as excited as a hunter who had found his prey, and he led the formation to dive down, dropping bombs on the tank group. The lights on the tanks went out, and the enemy's anti-aircraft guns began to fire fiercely. Li Liangxie and his comrades fearlessly continued to bomb and strafe the target fiercely. In an instant, twenty-five large fires were burning on the ground, and the flames licked the night sky, making the valley glow red. The bombing mission was completed, and Li Liangxie ordered his wingmen to return first, and he flew back afterwards. With his superb piloting skills, he steered the wounded plane safely back to base.
    Li Liangxie had just jumped out of the cockpit after landing when he was warmly embraced by his comrades who had been waiting at the airfield for a long time. In the past, his comrades had also welcomed him so warmly every time he returned from a flight, but this time, he felt particularly happy and relaxed.
    Li Liangxie, who has made outstanding contributions to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said in a firm tone after he finished telling the visiting people about the heroic deeds of the pilots: "We must make even greater contributions in the war to defend the motherland and oppose U.S. aggression with more courageous fighting, and strive to be a glorious Air Force Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - an Eagle of Kim Il-sung. This is the lofty aspiration of every commander and fighter of our Korean People's Army Air Force." (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜人民军轰炸机飞行员李良燮
    纪东
    和朝鲜人民军的许多飞行员一样，李良燮也是一个勇敢而年青的空军战士。他今年二十四岁，原来是一家化学工厂的工人。朝鲜卫国战争开始时，他在步兵部队中当重机枪射手，后来被调去受了短期的飞行训练，成了一个优秀的空军驾驶员。
    两年多来，李良燮已经驾驶着他的轰炸机光荣地完成了数十次飞行战斗任务。他有好几次乘着夜航轰炸机飞到敌人后方去袭击敌军，为祖国立下了很大的功勋。他先后获得了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的两枚二级自由独立勋章和一枚三级国旗勋章。
    他的许多次的飞行战斗中，轰炸金浦飞机场是一次光辉的出击。金浦机场是美国侵朝空军的前哨基地，美国飞机常常从那里闯到朝鲜人民军的后方来杀人放火。朝鲜人民向自己英勇的空军战士发出了号召：“破坏金浦机场，炸毁那里的敌机！”
    一九五二年元旦前夕，没有月亮，也没有云，只有繁星在夜空中闪烁。在朝鲜北部某地的机场上，有一队轰炸机随着发动机的震耳响声腾空而起，朝着南方飞去。
    朝鲜人民忠实的儿子——李良燮所率领的轰炸机队载着千万人民的仇恨，越过高山、河流、森林、城镇，朝着金浦机场飞行。地面上有几处升起大火，美国空中强盗投掷的燃烧弹又在毁灭着宁静的村镇。李良燮和他的战友们在轰响的马达声中，好像听到了千万个受难人民的呼喊：“替我们报仇呀，狠狠地杀死美国强盗啊！”飞行员们咬紧着嘴唇加快了航速，勇猛地划破夜空向前飞进。不一会他们已飞临汉江下游的上空，金浦机场就在眼前了。
    机场上的敌人似乎已经发觉朝鲜人民军轰炸机队的到来，他们向着夜空放射出探照灯光，并且飞起两架夜间战斗机警戒天空，而他们的机场上却依然是灯火辉煌。朝鲜人民军的轰炸机编队英勇地朝着光亮的机场继续飞去，飞行员们突然关闭了发动机，无声无响地在机场上空滑翔。李良燮发现了停放在机场上的敌机以后，立即向编队发出了战斗命令。他把操纵杆向前一推，率领机群从高空俯冲下去，把大批炸弹准确地投向敌人的飞机和机场仓库，接着又用机关枪猛烈地扫射。机场上当即发出了剧烈的爆炸声，冒起了浓烟和大火。
    轰炸机编队完成轰炸任务后，越过汉江向基地返航了。这时敌人的高射炮还在慌慌张张地瞎打一阵。
    为了祖国和金日成将军，为了替兄弟姊妹们复仇，朝鲜人民军的每一个飞行员都是奋不顾身地去作战。有一次李良燮所驾驶的轰炸机的机翼在前进途中被敌机打伤了，但是他仍然勇往直前地完成了战斗任务，带着胜利飞返基地。
    那是在一九五一年六月二十七日夜间，他和战友们奉命去轰炸集中在涟川到全谷里公路上的美国侵略军的坦克群。在飞行途中，他们遇到敌人夜航战斗机的袭击。李良燮一面奋勇地向敌机应战，一面命令僚机低空飞行，摆脱敌机，继续急速地前进。正在这时，他突然感到自己的飞机航速缓慢下来，爬高度也在降低——飞机的机翼已经受了伤。这时美国空中强盗野蛮轰炸的暴行和祖国人民渴望复仇的眼泪又闪现在李良燮的脑际，他立刻下定决心“即使粉身碎骨，我也要去完成战斗任务！”他机灵地摆脱了敌机的袭击，驾驶着受伤的飞机费力地向前飞去，终于追上了自己的僚机。
    敌人的坦克正亮着红色、绿色的灯光，密集地停在山谷里和公路上。李良燮像猎手发现了猎物一样的兴奋，他率领着机群俯冲下去，把炸弹投在坦克群中。坦克上的灯火熄灭了，敌人的高射炮开始了猛烈的射击。李良燮和他的战友们无畏地对准目标继续进行猛烈的轰炸、扫射。片刻间，地面上燃起了二十五堆大火，火舌舐着夜空，映得山谷一片通红。轰炸任务完成了，李良燮命令僚机先行返航，他随后飞回。他以卓越的驾驶技术，操纵着负伤的飞机安全地返回了基地。
    李良燮在飞机着陆后，刚跳出机舱，被早就等候在机场上的战友们热情地拥抱起来。从前他每次飞行归来，战友们也是这样热烈地来欢迎他的，而这一次，他特别感到愉快和轻松。
    为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建立卓著功勋的李良燮，当他向访问他的人讲完了飞行员们英勇战斗的事迹以后，他用坚毅的口吻说道：“我们要在保卫祖国、反对美国侵略的战争中，以更勇敢的战斗建树更大的功勋，争取做一个光荣的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国空军英雄——金日成之鹰。这是我们朝鲜人民军空军部队每个指挥员和战斗员的崇高志愿。”　　　　（新华社）
