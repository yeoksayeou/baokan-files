    Japan and the Struggle for Peace
    -- Written for the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference
    Corresponding Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Ruke
    Seven years have passed since Japan's unconditional surrender. A year ago, the so-called "peace" treaty with Japan was signed in San Francisco. However, Japan is farther from true peace, from eradicating militarism, and from ending foreign occupation than at any time since the war.
    Two basic factors determine Japan's current political situation: the oppression of the American occupiers and the polarization of domestic democratic and reactionary forces.
    Not long ago, American imperialists boasted that Japan "has been thoroughly disarmed and democratized," "Japanese militarism can never raise its head again," etc. Now, with their characteristic shamelessness, they openly encourage Japan to rearm as quickly as possible. The defeated Japanese militarists have become the allies and "friends" of American imperialism. American ruling circles painstakingly look after the Japanese reactionaries so that the resurrected Japanese army, navy, and air force—tools for aggression against Asia—can be placed under the control of American imperialism more quickly. However, America's "friendship" has brought slavery to the Japanese people.
    The American military occupation is not only a heavy material burden for Japan. The infamous "Security Treaty" and the so-called "Administrative Agreement," which fixed the presence of American occupation forces in Japan, have brutally trampled on Japan's sovereignty. These are documents that subject Japan to national humiliation.
    According to the authoritative testimony of a Japanese legal scholar: The "Administrative Agreement" grants the American armed forces very broad extraterritorial rights, even recreating the situation of capitulation that existed decades ago in Turkey and China with "concessions" and consular jurisdiction. This Japanese author pointed out that even then, only a relatively small number of foreign residents enjoyed extraterritorial rights, and consular jurisdiction was rarely applied outside of designated areas. However, the "Administrative Agreement" imposed on Japan allows tens or even hundreds of thousands of American military personnel and their families to exercise extraterritorial rights in a vast area. "The scope of the transfer of sovereignty to foreign countries is unparalleled in human history." (See Professor Kamikawa's article in the "Oriental Economist" magazine, April 12, 1952.) With the foreign occupation comes the rampage of American soldiers on Japanese soil, insulting the Japanese people's dignity, calling them "inferior races," poisoning Japanese youth, and instilling in them various vices of the "American" hooligan "lifestyle."
    The militarization of the Japanese economy, carried out to satisfy the United States, has resulted in a one-sided and distorted economic development, a reduction in non-military production sectors, and an increase in unemployment and poverty among the broad masses of laborers. According to the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun": The number of suicides in Japan in 1951 broke the record, with as many as 22,622 suicide cases in one year. According to materials from the Japanese Ministry of Labor, in the second half of 1951 alone, there were 658 registered cases of selling children; most of them were farmers and day laborers. Obviously, the number of unregistered cases of slave trading is much higher. It is said that an eleven-year-old girl was sold for sixteen pounds of potatoes. This is the result of the American occupation policy's "democratization" of Japan!
    It must be pointed out that although some Japanese concerns can make a fortune from military orders, especially those related to American armed intervention in Korea, the interests of Japanese industrialists are still greatly harmed by the American occupiers. The most obvious example is the American prohibition on Japanese companies trading with China, forcing them to buy American industrial raw materials and coal at very high prices.
    The American occupation has brought endless disasters to the Japanese people, who are suffering from national oppression and are in a difficult situation of being militarily, politically, and economically subordinated to the predatory American imperialism. For the Japanese working masses, almost the greatest misfortune is the prospect of becoming victims of the American capitalists' military aggression plans. Therefore, the Japanese people's struggle to break free from American occupation is inextricably linked to the struggle for peace.
    The domestic political situation in Japan proves that the vast majority of residents yearn for peace and liberation from American imperialist enslavement. The Japanese Communist Party, in its new program, has put forward the task of establishing a broad national democratic united front, which has won the trust and support of people from all walks of life. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, representatives of the middle class, merchants, and industrialists, although in different forms and to varying degrees, have expressed their anger at the traitorous Yoshida government and the reactionary groups that support it, which have become the spiritual and political pillars of the American occupiers. The Yoshida government signed a surrender agreement with the American imperialists that legalized the continued military occupation of Japan, but these agreements have been opposed by mass protests, strikes, and student strikes by the Japanese people.
    The Japanese working class, despite the fascist police terror at home and the persecution of Communists and all honest democrats, and despite the divisive activities of the right-wing Socialists, is at the forefront, leading all democratic forces in the struggle for peace and national independence. The May Day demonstrations in 1952, carried out under the slogan of mobilizing the masses against the Yoshida government, terrified the Japanese reactionaries and caused panic in the country of their American masters. The Yoshida government's shooting of demonstrators and mass arrests only intensified the people's anger. A situation is forming in Japan in which the reactionary ruling group, as the internal pillar of the American occupiers in Japan, has essentially declared war on its own people. At the "security" leaders' meeting presided over by Yoshida in early August, a provocative resolution was passed: "If riots occur that cannot be suppressed by the police force, the Security Force (i.e., the organized backbone of the Japanese army being restored) can be dispatched, and mobile units can be deployed to major cities to suppress collective violent actions."
    The Japanese reactionaries are clamoring to use the army established with American support to suppress the democratic movement. However, there is no doubt that the actions of the Yoshida group, supported by war criminal Emperor Hirohito, semi-feudal landlords, monopoly capitalists, militarists, and big bureaucrats, have increasingly exposed its true colors and led to its isolation.
    The Japanese reactionary camp, which is acting against the people, is trying its best to take advantage of America's greed for rearming Japan to gain the most benefits. The Japanese ruling group is trying to revive the old militarist machine; to build a strong army to ensure that Japanese imperialism plays an independent role in realizing the predatory aggression plans harbored by the United States. The Japanese reactionaries are temporarily kowtowing to the American imperialists and convincing them of their loyalty as "allies." But, without a doubt, Japanese monopoly capitalists do not intend to be satisfied with acting as "errand boys" for the billionaires across the ocean. The growth of Japanese militarism supported by the United States will inevitably lead to an increase in Japan's own imperialist appetite.
    The Japanese reactionaries dream of a new war so that they can accelerate the realization of their revanchist plans.
    The Japanese people are fighting against the Yoshida group and the reactionary forces that support it, against the policy of reviving Japanese militarism, and against the recurrence of military adventures that once brought shameful defeat to Japanese imperialism.
    The Japanese people are defending the cause of peace and resolutely opposing the aggressive "alliance" formed by the Japanese and American imperialist reactionaries, aimed at opposing the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all freedom-loving people of Asia.
    The fact that Professor Ikuo Oyama was awarded the Stalin International Peace Prize demonstrates that the Japanese people's struggle for peace has been highly valued. This struggle is also a struggle to free Japan from American occupation and restore Japan's national independence.
    The great Stalin wrote in his New Year's greetings to the Japanese people on December 31, 1951: "Please convey to the Japanese people my wishes for freedom and happiness, and my wishes for their complete victory in the heroic struggle for the independence of their motherland.
    In the past, the Soviet people themselves experienced the pain of being occupied by foreign countries, an occupation in which Japanese imperialists also participated. Therefore, the Soviet people fully understand the suffering of the Japanese people, deeply sympathize with them, and believe that they will certainly be able to seek the rebirth and independence of their motherland, as the Soviet people once did." (Pravda, January 1, 1952)
    The entire progressive humanity sympathizes with the Japanese people's national liberation struggle.
    The victorious conclusion of the Japanese people's liberation struggle will be a great contribution to the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world. (Xinhua News Agency)

    日本与争取和平的斗争
    ——为亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议而作
    苏联科学院通讯院士  儒科夫
    自从日本无条件投降以来已经七年了。一年以前在旧金山签订了所谓对日“和”约。但是日本距离真正的和平，距离肃清军国主义和停止外国的占领，却比战后任何时候都更加遥远了。
    两个基本因素决定着日本当前的政治情况，一是美国占领者的压迫，二是国内民主势力与反动势力的两极化。
    美帝国主义者在比较不久以前还大吹大擂地说：日本“已经彻底解除武装并民主化了”“日本军国主义再也不能抬头了”等等；现在却以其特有的无耻态度，公然鼓励日本尽速重新武装起来。战败了的日本军国主义分子变成了美帝国主义的同盟者和“朋友”。美国统治集团煞费苦心地看待日本反动分子，以使复活的日本陆、海、空军——侵略亚洲的工具——更迅速地置于美帝国主义的支配之下。然而美国的“友谊”却给日本人民带来了奴役。
    美国的军事占领不仅是给日本带来了沉重的物质负担。臭名昭彰的“安全条约”和把美国占领军驻扎日本的情况固定下来的所谓“行政协定”，更使日本的主权遭到粗暴的蹂躏，这些是使日本蒙受民族侮辱的文件。
    根据一个日本法学家的权威证明：“行政协定”给与美国武装部队以非常广泛的治外法权，甚至几十年前土耳其和中国存在“租界地”和领事裁判权时的那种投降情况都重新产生了。这位日本作者指出，但是即便在当时，享有治外法权的也不过是为数比较不多的外国侨民，并且领事裁判权也很少施用于规定的地区之外。而强加于日本的“行政协定”则使数万甚至数十万的美国军事人员及其家属在极广大的地区内皆可行使治外法权。“把主权转让给外国，其范围之广，在人类历史上是无与伦比的。”（见神川教授在一九五二年四月十二日“东方经济学家”杂志上的论文。）随着外国占领而来的是美国军人在日本国土上横行霸道，侮辱日本人的人格，称日本人为“下等人种”，毒化日本青年，使日本青年养成“美国”流氓“生活方式”的各种恶习。
    为满足美国而实行的日本经济军事化，其结果造成经济的片面畸形的发展，非军事生产部门的缩减，广大劳动群众的失业与贫困的增长。据日本“朝日新闻”报道：一九五一年日本的自杀人数打破了纪录，一年内的自杀事件竟达两万二千六百二十二起之多。根据日本劳动省的材料，一九五一年下半年内，登记出卖子女的就有六百五十八起；其中主要是农民和短工。显然，未曾登记的贩卖奴隶的事实则更要多得多。据说，有一个十一岁的幼女被卖了十六磅马铃薯。这就是美国占领政策使日本“民主化”的结果！
    必须指出，虽然日本的某些康采恩可以靠军事订货，特别是与美国武装干涉朝鲜有关的军事订货而大发其财，但是日本工业界人士的利益仍然遭到美国占领者的极大侵害。最明显的一个例子，就是美国禁止日本公司与中国进行贸易，而强迫日本公司以非常高昂的价格购买美国的工业原料和煤炭。
    美国的占领给遭受民族压迫、在军事、政治、经济上陷入从属美帝国主义强盗之困难境地的日本人民带来了无穷的灾难；而对日本劳动大众说来，几乎最大的不幸，就是有变为美国企业家军事侵略计划的牺牲品的前途。因此，日本人民争取摆脱美国占领的斗争是与争取和平的斗争有着不可分的联系的。 
    日本国内的政治情况，证明绝大多数的居民都渴望和平，渴望从美帝国主义奴役下解脱出来。日本共产党在其新纲领中提出了建立广泛的民族民主战线的任务，得到了各阶层人民的信任和拥护。工人、农民、知识分子、中间阶层的代表人物、商人及工业家，尽管形式不同程度不同，却都表示了对吉田卖国政府以及支持它的反动集团的愤怒，这个反动集团已经成了美国占领者在精神上和政治上的支柱。吉田政府同美帝国主义者签定了使继续军事占领日本合法化的投降协定，但是这些协定遭到了日本人民群众的抗议示威、罢工和罢课的反对。
    日本工人阶级不顾国内的法西斯警察恐怖和对共产党员及一切正直的民主分子的迫害，不顾社会党右派的分裂活动，走在最前列，领导着一切民主力量为争取和平与民族独立而斗争。在动员人民群众反对吉田政府的口号下进行的一九五二年五一示威游行，使得日本反动分子胆战心惊，在他们的美国主子的国家里引起了惊慌。吉田政府枪杀示威群众，大肆逮捕，只是加重了人民的愤怒。在日本正在形成一种局势，在这种局势下作为美国占领者在日本的内部支柱的反动统治集团，实质上向本国人民宣了战。八月初在吉田主持下进行的“治安”首脑人员会议上通过了一项挑衅性的决议：“如遇发生警察力量不足以镇压的骚动时，得出动保安队
    （即正在恢复中的日本军队底有组织的骨干），并把机动部队调配到各大城市，以镇压集体的暴力行动。”
    日本反动派扬言要利用在美国人扶持下建立起来的军队压制民主运动。但是，无疑的，为战犯裕仁天皇、半封建地主、垄断资本家、军国主义分子及大官僚所支持的吉田集团的行为，已日益使它的真面目暴露出来，促使它陷于孤立。
    与人民作对的日本反动阵营，在竭力利用美国对重新武装日本的贪婪来取得最多的利益。日本统治集团力图使旧军国主义机器复活；建立强大的军队，以保证日本帝国主义在实现美国所怀抱的强盗侵略计划的过程中起独立的作用。日本反动派暂时在美帝国主义者面前摇尾乞怜，并使他们相信自己作为“同盟者”的忠诚。但是，毫无疑问，日本垄断资本家是不打算满足于充当大洋彼岸亿万富翁的“小伙计”的。美国扶持起来的日本军国主义的增长，不可避免地将引起日本自己的帝国主义胃口的增大。
    日本反动派梦想着新的战争，以便能够加速实现其报复主义的计划。
    日本人民进行着反对吉田集团以及支持它的反动势力的斗争，反对复活日本军国主义的政策，反对曾使日本帝国主义招致可耻失败的军事冒险的重演。
    日本人民捍卫着和平事业，坚决反对美日帝国主义反动派所结成的、旨在反对苏联、中华人民共和国和亚洲一切爱好自由的人民的侵略“同盟”。
    大山郁夫教授荣获斯大林国际和平奖金的事实证明了日本人民争取和平的斗争已得到高度评价。这一斗争同时也是使日本摆脱美国占领、恢复日本民族独立的斗争。
    伟大的斯大林在一九五一年十二月三十一日致日本人民的新年贺电中写道： “请转告日本人民，我祝他们自由幸福，我祝他们为争取他们的祖国的独立而进行的英勇斗争获得完全胜利。
    以往苏联人民自己曾经历过被外国占领的痛苦，这种占领是日本帝国主义者也曾参加过的。因此苏联人民完全理解日本人民的苦难，深切同情他们，相信他们一定能够像苏联人民过去曾经做到的那样求得他们的祖国的新生和独立。”（一九五二年一月一日真理报）
    整个进步人类都同情日本人民的民族解放斗争。
    日本人民解放斗争的胜利结局，将是对保卫远东及世界和平事业的伟大贡献。（新华社）
