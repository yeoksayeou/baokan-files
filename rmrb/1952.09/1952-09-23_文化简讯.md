Propaganda Posters to Welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to be Published Soon
The All-China Association of Art Workers, in order to welcome the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, has specially organized art workers from various places to create propaganda posters with the theme of defending peace. The writers' works express the Asian people's enthusiasm and desire for peace, as well as the Chinese people's efforts and confidence in the cause of peace. These propaganda posters will be published and distributed soon.

In addition, five sets of color art postcards titled "Our Great Motherland," published by the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, will also be published soon. These color art postcards vividly reflect the face of our motherland and the happy lives of the people.

Qingdao City Holds Workers' Art Creation Exhibition
Qingdao City recently held a Workers' Art Creation Exhibition. A total of 482 workers' art works participated in the exhibition, including comic strips, posters, cartoons, and shadowgraph cards. The works exhibited mainly focused on increasing production and practicing economy, and most of them had played a certain role in promoting production in various factories and were loved by the working masses. They reflected the workers' sense of ownership and their creative labor attitude of finding tricks, caring for machines, and uniting to move forward.

"Qingdao Daily" selected and published the workers' art works exhibited this time with a larger space, and published reports on Qingdao workers' art creation activities, pointing out the achievements of Qingdao workers' art creation activities and the issues that should be paid attention to in the future.

Holding mass art creation exhibitions in such a planned way, and conducting systematic reports and introductions on the works and creation activities, is an effective way to promote mass art creation activities.

    青岛市举办工人美术创作展览会
    青岛市最近举办了一次工人美术创作展览会。参加展览的工人美术作品共四百八十二幅，包括连环画、招贴画、漫画、洋片画等。展览的作品以增产节约为主要内容，大部分都曾在各工厂生产上起过一定的推动作用，并为工人群众所热爱。它们反映了工人的主人翁思想及找窍门、爱护机器、团结前进等创造性的劳动态度。
    “青岛日报”以较大的篇幅选刊了这次所展出的工人美术作品，并刊载了关于青岛工人美术创作活动的报道，指出了青岛工人美术创作活动上的成就及今后应注意的问题。
    这样有计划地举办群众美术创作展览会，并对作品及创作活动进行较系统的报道和介绍，是推动群众美术创作活动的一种有效方式。
