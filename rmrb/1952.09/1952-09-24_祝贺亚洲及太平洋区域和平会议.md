    Congratulations on the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference
    Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Vice-President of the World Peace Council
    The Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference will be held in Beijing soon. Everyone understands the importance of this conference for the people of Asia and its impact on the world. Without a doubt, it will be a brilliant prelude to the World People's Peace Congress to be held in Vienna on December 5th.
    The Beijing conference will draw the world's attention to the serious problems facing the people of the Indian and Pacific Ocean coast countries.
    Since the fifteenth century, Europeans have landed on the coasts of these countries. The original inhabitants of these countries were mostly colored people with a high degree of civilization. Europeans, who are proud of their own history, generally know nothing about the history of other nations. Bold adventurers and greedy merchants violently imposed humiliating and cruel rule on the peoples they called "savages." But Hugo said: "The person who discovers an island has no right to harm it." He also said: "A nation cannot possess another nation, just as a person cannot possess another person. The crime of possessing a nation is more heinous than the crime of possessing another person."
    Along the Pacific Ocean—the largest ocean on earth—what we find in the Americas or Asia are all places that were previously occupied by the Spanish, Portuguese, French, or British. These colonies and territories have always longed to regain their national independence. Some have already achieved this goal. However, most are fighting alone against masters with very good arms and have not yet succeeded, and these masters continue to exploit them. For the people of all these countries, lasting peace is impossible until their national independence is recognized.
    In recent years, a large country in Asia, China, with a population of 475 million, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, a poet and great people's leader, drove out the invaders and established the People's Republic of China. After years of war, terrible poverty, and being deceived, the Chinese people have liberated themselves; now they recognize their own strength, and they are happily building their future. China has become a great hope and example for the people of countries in the Asian and Pacific regions. Everyone can see from magazines like "People's China," which are becoming more and more widely circulated, what the new democratic country is based on, and what great tasks it should accomplish to ensure its prosperity.
    "People's China" is especially welcomed by readers throughout Asia, which shows that the people of India, Japan, Vietnam, and Iran are united with the Chinese people, and at the same time fully demonstrates that they need peace and that they have a common will for peace. In 1943, India suffered a severe famine caused by the Second World War, resulting in the death of three million people. Therefore, we can understand the country's concerns about the possibility of a Third World War, and it is not difficult to explain how the Indian people oppose the recurrence of the same disaster.
    This unity and will for peace will be clearly expressed at the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The choice of Beijing as the venue for the conference also reflects the Asian people's admiration and gratitude towards China.
    This conference will also bring the support and solidarity of peace-loving men and women around the world to the people of Asia. In fact, today there are no purely local problems—at the International Conference for the Defence of Children held in Vienna in April 1952, the Japanese representative described how Japanese parents were forced by poverty to sell their seven-year-old children to others as slaves, while an Indian doctor described the terribly high infant mortality rate in Indian cities, and an Iranian female worker spoke about the bloody hands of the children employed in factories weaving Persian carpets. At that time, no listener was not deeply moved, no one felt that they did not bear a part of the responsibility for this situation, and no one did not firmly express their determination to do everything possible to improve the situation of children around the world.
    In the past few years, various groups have been established around the world, consolidating this solidarity.
    Young people of all countries and different races are developing this deep friendship in great international gatherings, which can be used to "eliminate war forever."
    Women have established an international federation, and they are working everywhere to drive war away from the cradles of their children. They are pained by the suffering of women in Korea and Vietnam, and therefore urgently hope to end the terrible wars that are killing children and destroying these countries. They are fully confident that prestigious women who have contributed to China's great victory, such as Soong Ching Ling and Cai Chang, will speak from the podium in Beijing about the desire for peace of millions of Eastern women.
    Their example will inspire women and mothers around the world to save their children from this incredible, foolish destruction, and the disaster that is increasingly threatening the future of humanity and the world's legacy of thousands of years.
    The vast majority of upright people around the world are opposing this foolishness, this infectious foolishness! Their just desire is simply and powerfully expressed in the World Peace Council's call: "Let the spirit of consultation triumph over the solution by force!"
    After the Peace Conference of Asian and Pacific countries is held, the World People's Peace Congress will be convened on December 5th. This conference will be beneficial to the Peace Congress. The World People's Peace Congress will be a decisive step on the difficult road to peace: the will of the people of the world must urge the major powers to reduce armaments and force the major powers to conclude peace treaties.

### 祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议

    祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    国际民主妇女联合会主席  世界和平理事会副主席  尤金尼·戈登夫人
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议将于日内在北京召开。每一个人都了解这个会议对于亚洲人民的重要性以及对全世界的影响。毫无疑问，它将是十二月五日在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会的辉煌的前奏。
    北京会议将使全世界注意印度洋及太平洋沿岸各国人民所面临着的严重问题。
    自从十五世纪以来，欧洲人便在这些国家的海岸上登陆。这些国家原来的居民大都是有高度文明的有色人民。而以自己的历史自豪的欧洲人，一般说来对其他民族的历史是一无所知的。胆大的冒险家和贪婪的商人以暴力把屈辱和残酷的统治强加于他们所谓“野蛮人”的人民的头上。可是雨果说过：“发现一个岛屿的人没有权利去残害它。”他又说：“一个民族不能占有另一个民族，正如一个人不能占有另一个人一样。占有一个民族的罪恶比占有另一个人的罪恶更为丑恶。”
    沿着太平洋——地球上最大的海洋，我们在美洲或亚洲所发现的尽是一些以前曾为西班牙人、葡萄牙人、法国人或英国人所强占的地方。这些殖民地和领地始终渴望重新获得它们的民族独立。有些已经达到了这个目的。但大部分却单独地与那些拥有很优良武装的主人进行斗争而尚未获得成功，而这些主人们还在继续剥削它们。对于所有这些国家的人民，在他们的民族独立未获得承认以前，持久和平是不可能实现的。
    近几年来，亚洲的一个大国，拥有四亿七千五百万人民的中国，在一个诗人同时又是伟大的人民领袖毛泽东的领导下驱逐了侵略者，建立了中华人民共和国。经过了多年的战争、可怕的贫困和遭受蒙蔽之后，中国人民自己获得了解放；现在他们认识了自己的力量，他们正在愉快地建设着他们的将来。中国已经成为亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民的一个伟大的希望和榜样。每一个人可以从流传得越来越广的如同“人民中国”一类的杂志中看到这个新民主主义国家是建立在什么基础之上，以及为了保证它的繁荣它应该完成那些伟大的任务。
    “人民中国”尤其为整个亚洲的读者所欢迎，这说明印度、日本、越南和伊朗的人民是与中国人民团结一致的，同时充分显示他们需要和平，他们有共同的和平意志。在一九四三年，印度由于第二次世界大战所引起的严重饥荒，造成三百万人民的死亡，因此我们可以了解这个国家对于第三次世界大战的可能性所感到的忧虑，并且也不难说明印度人民如何反对同样灾祸的重演。
    这种团结与和平意志将在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上明确地表示出来。北京被选为会议的地点也正反映了亚洲人民对中国的爱慕和感激。
    这个会议也一定会将全世界爱好和平男女的支持和团结带给亚洲人民。事实上，今天已经没有单纯的地方性的问题——在一九五二年四月维也纳举行的国际保卫儿童大会上，日本代表描述了日本的父母们如何因迫于穷困而将自己的七岁孩子卖给别人当奴隶，同时印度医生叙述了在印度城市里婴儿死亡率高得可怕，一个伊朗女工讲到被雇在织造波斯地毯的工厂中做工的小孩子们双手流血的情形，当时没有一个听众不深深受到感动，没有一个人不感到自己对这种情况负有一部分责任，也没有一个人不坚决表示要全力为改善全世界儿童的状况而努力。
    过去几年，世界上成立了各种不同的团体，巩固着这种团结。
    所有国家和各种不同种族的青年在伟大的国际集会里发展着这种可以用来“永远消灭战争”的深厚的友谊。
    妇女已经成立了一个国际联合会，她们正在各处努力从她们孩子的摇篮边驱走战争。她们为朝鲜和越南的妇女们的苦难而感到痛苦，因此迫切希望结束正在屠杀儿童和毁灭这些国家的可怕战争。她们完全相信：在中国伟大的胜利中出过力量的有威望的妇女如宋庆龄与蔡畅，将由北京的讲坛上讲出千百万东方妇女对和平的愿望。
    她们的榜样将鼓舞着全世界妇女和母亲，要使她们的孩子免于这个不可思议的愚蠢的毁灭，而这个毁灭的浩劫日益威胁着人类的将来以及世界上数千年来的遗产。
    全世界绝大多数正直的人们正反对这种愚蠢，有感染性的愚蠢！他们正当的愿望简单而有力地在世界和平理事会的号召里表达出来了：“使协商精神战胜武力解决！”
    亚洲及太平洋国家的和平会议开会之后，将在十二月五日召开世界人民和平大会。这次会议对于和平大会将有裨益。世界人民和平大会将是通往和平的艰难道路上的一个决定性的步骤：世界人民的意志必须促使各大国裁减军备，迫使各大国缔结和平公约。（新华社）
