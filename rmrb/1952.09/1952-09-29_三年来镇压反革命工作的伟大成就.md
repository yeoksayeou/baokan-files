Great Achievements in the Work of Suppressing Counter-revolutionaries Over the Past Three Years
Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security of the Central People's Government

Over the past three years, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Public Security Organs have carried out a fierce struggle to suppress counter-revolutionaries throughout the country and have achieved great success. On the one hand, it has dealt a devastating blow to the remaining counter-revolutionary forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, namely, a considerable number of counter-revolutionaries in five aspects: bandits, local bullies, secret agents, reactionary parties and groups, and reactionary secret societies. On the other hand, this fierce struggle has provided effective political and class education to the broad masses of the people, and has raised the level of awareness and organization of the broad masses of the people. These two aspects of achievement have had an extremely profound impact on all aspects of our national life.

With the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolutionary War, the people's democratic dictatorship system was universally established throughout the country, the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China was forever ended, and the people of the whole country began to devote themselves to the struggle to build a new life as masters of their own affairs. However, as Chairman Mao said in his opening address at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their defeat, and they will still make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will attempt to restore their rule in China every day and every hour." Facts have proved that Chairman Mao's instructions were completely correct. At the beginning of the liberation of the mainland, in the vast newly liberated areas, although the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was overthrown and the people's democratic regime was established, in such areas, the people's regime and the people's victory were still not consolidated, and a large number of counter-revolutionaries were scattered in every corner of society, engaging in sabotage and disruption. As for the areas like the Southwest and South China which were liberated last, the situation in some places was even more serious. At one time, secret agents were rampant, bandits were rampant, and local bullies, key members of reactionary parties and groups, and heads of reactionary secret societies colluded with secret agents and bandits to carry out criminal activities against the people's government everywhere. The situation in the newly liberated areas was like this. In the old liberated areas, the situation was of course completely different. Here, the advantage of the masses had long been completely established, and the people's democratic dictatorship had been consolidated. But even in such areas, in places where our work was relatively weak and in cities that were liberated later, there were still lurking counter-revolutionaries engaged in sabotage activities. When counter-revolutionary activities were rampant throughout the country, these lurking counter-revolutionaries also carried out sabotage of a serious nature. This shows that although the Chinese people's revolution has won victory throughout the country, the victory is still not consolidated because there are still a large number of counter-revolutionaries who have not been eliminated. Therefore, a serious struggle task must be put before the Chinese people, that is to say: in order to defend the victory already won by the Chinese people and consolidate the Chinese people's own regime, the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries must absolutely not be tolerated, and resolute suppression must be taken against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries.

Originally, Chairman Mao had repeatedly taught us to maintain a high degree of vigilance against the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries. In the famous thesis "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation," Chairman Mao again regarded the suppression of counter-revolutionaries as one of the eight fundamental tasks and put it before the whole party and the people of the whole country, instructing us to "resolutely eliminate all bandits, secret agents, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionaries who endanger the people." However, for a period of time, we did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's instructions, and therefore we did not implement them firmly and thoroughly. In the early days of liberation, although we carried out some searches and arrests of a large number of counter-revolutionaries left over by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, we also organized registration work for the key members of reactionary parties and groups in some cities, and we also banned the destructive activities of reactionary secret societies in some places. These tasks all played a certain role. However, because the work was not carried out firmly and thoroughly enough, especially because the masses were not mobilized, the key to the counter-revolution was not hit, and a large number of counter-revolutionaries were let go. In addition, the victory of the revolution throughout the country produced paralysis in our vast number of cadres, relaxed their vigilance against the counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy, and in some areas, made wrong and one-sided understanding of our policy of combining suppression and leniency towards counter-revolutionaries, resulting in the deviation of "unlimited leniency." This actually equaled condoning and even encouraging the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionaries, which also became an important reason why counter-revolutionaries were able to be rampant for a while in the early days of liberation for nearly half a year. The Party and the People's Government quickly discovered and resolutely corrected these deviations. Starting from December 1950, a vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was gradually launched throughout the country. In this movement, the Party and the People's Government adopted a clear and firm policy and carried out large-scale propaganda activities on the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. The activities of the broad masses of the people in accusing, reporting, and spontaneously capturing counter-revolutionaries were a prominent feature of this movement. Therefore, this movement, whether in terms of the effect of eliminating counter-revolutionaries, the extent of the mobilization of the masses, or the healthy development of the movement, was unprecedented, and achieved a great victory in eliminating a large number of counter-revolutionaries.

Through the vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, we have basically eliminated the remaining counter-revolutionary forces on the Chinese mainland. The scourge of bandits, which was once serious, has been basically extinguished. The few bandits still remaining in some remote areas are being continued to be suppressed and captured by the People's Public Security Organs and the People's Public Security Forces in cooperation with the People's Liberation Army, and will be completely eliminated in a short period of time. In addition, we have also eliminated a large number of secret agents, local bullies, and resolute counter-revolutionaries in reactionary parties and groups and reactionary secret societies. This great victory has greatly strengthened the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship. This is first manifested in the significant improvement of the prestige of the Party and the People's Government and the increasingly close relationship with the masses of the people. After the severe suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the masses of the people cheered and praised the wise measures of the Party and the People's Government, which consolidated the victory of the Chinese people. Within the various democratic classes, there was greater unity in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries, and the counter-revolutionaries were completely isolated, and their conspiracies of provocation and sabotage were nakedly exposed to the broad masses of the people and went bankrupt. Secondly, because counter-revolutionaries were eliminated, the people's governments at all levels throughout the country, especially the grassroots people's governments, were consolidated and purified; the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and the land reform movement, as well as other social reform movements, were supported. In addition, the relations between the various ethnic groups have been further improved due to the victory of the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries. At the beginning of the liberation of some ethnic minority areas, counter-revolutionaries used historical ethnic estrangement to create many rumors, undermine the ethnic policies of the People's Government, attempt to instigate ethnic minority people to oppose the People's Government, and even attempt to deceive and threaten some ethnic minority people to participate in riots. However, because the People's Government correctly implemented ethnic policies and led the ethnic minority people to carry out appropriate and resolute struggles against counter-revolutionaries, it cracked down on the extremely small number of counter-revolutionaries who committed heinous crimes and were hated by the majority of the ethnic minority people, thereby further enhancing the unity between ethnic groups. The increasing unity among all ethnic groups and democratic classes in the struggle against counter-revolutionaries is one of the basic conditions for ensuring the victory of the struggle.

The more important impact of the victory in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is that it has protected the smooth progress of our country's production recovery and development work, and has created conditions for the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin. The masses in many places deeply feel that only after suppressing counter-revolutionaries and extinguishing the sabotage and disruption of counter-revolutionaries can they truly be liberated and truly have a stable environment for production and work, and therefore their enthusiasm for production has greatly increased. The focus of the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries—our country's industry and transportation—now also has a relatively safe guarantee. Now, industrial products going to the countryside and agricultural products entering the city are smooth and unimpeded. In order to consolidate these valuable achievements, hundreds of millions of public security organizations have been established in urban and rural areas, and they are using the rich experience they have gained in the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries to vigilantly protect the safety of production and construction. In this way, the large-scale economic construction that is about to begin will have a reliable guarantee.

The reason why the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries has achieved such great success is mainly because:

First, we concentrated our efforts on cracking down on the most heinous, incorrigible, and extremely hated counter-revolutionary ringleaders, while adopting a lenient policy towards counter-revolutionaries whose crimes were not very serious and who were willing to repent, and even towards those counter-revolutionaries who, according to their crimes, should have been executed, if they had no blood debts, did not arouse great public indignation, or their damage to the interests of the country had not reached the most serious level, we also adopted the policy of sentencing them to death with a reprieve, forced labor, and observing their behavior, giving them a final opportunity to repent. It is completely necessary for us to unswervingly adopt the policy of resolute suppression against the most heinous counter-revolutionary ringleaders and severely crack down on them. Only by severely cracking down on these counter-revolutionaries and transforming all counter-revolutionaries who can be transformed can we completely extinguish the fierce flames of counter-revolution, destroy the counter-revolutionary organizations, and eliminate the possibility of counter-revolutionaries endangering the country and the people.

Second, we followed the mass line, boldly mobilized the masses, attracted people from all walks of life to participate in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and carried out propaganda extensively and deeply, truly reaching the point of "everyone knows it, everyone understands it." In particular, because the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was passed through people's representative conferences and consultation committees at all levels, the movement attracted and connected a wider range of masses. In this way, the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries became a joint action of the masses of the people and the People's Government, and gained the support of the broad masses of the people, overcame the closed-doorism and mysticism in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and made the counter-revolutionaries who committed heinous crimes and were hated by the masses of the people even more isolated and exposed.

We were able to eliminate a large number of counter-revolutionaries in a short period of time and ensure the health and victory of the movement because we unswervingly adhered to the correct policy and boldly believed in and relied on the power of the masses.

Third, our work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries was led. This is not only reflected in having a clear policy towards counter-revolutionaries, but also in having the "Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Punishing Counter-revolutionaries" as a specific standard for sentencing. Arresting and sentencing people are based on the evidence of counter-revolutionary crimes. There is strict control and careful review. In particular, Chairman Mao's close guidance is of decisive significance for the correct development of the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries.

Fourth, the people's public security organs at all levels generally have experience and are prepared for the work of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Generally, relatively thorough investigations and studies are conducted in advance, and reliable materials and evidence are obtained; and in the process of work, a cautious attitude is adopted, and a clear mind is maintained at all times, vigilant against possible deviations. The people's procuratorates at all levels, the people's judicial organs at all levels, the people's courts, and the military judicial organs are also extremely cautious and extremely serious in the prosecution, trial, and sentencing of counter-revolutionary cases. All of these ensure that we can truly ensure that we will neither let go of a counter-revolutionary nor wrong a good person.

After three years of struggle, the Chinese people have basically eliminated the remaining large number of counter-revolutionaries. However, because the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries was carried out at different times in different places, our work also has different priorities, so the severity of the crackdown on counter-revolutionaries still varies. Judging from the national situation, in addition to a few places where the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has not yet been carried out vigorously and counter-revolutionaries have not received the punishment they deserve, even in areas where the suppression of counter-revolutionaries has been carried out vigorously, there is still a distinction between thorough, basically thorough, or basically not thorough. Even in areas that have been carried out thoroughly, there are still a number of counter-revolutionaries who have escaped justice, are at large, and are doing evil. Therefore, judging from the various regions of the country, the counter-revolutionaries scattered in various corners still have a certain number. Once there is any disturbance, these counter-revolutionaries will become restless again. For example, when the people's governments in various places were busy leading the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, and when U.S. imperialism spread bacteria in the Northeast and other places, they thought they had an opportunity to take advantage of and carried out various sabotage activities. Some created rumors and provoked discord, undermining the "Three-Anti" movement; some refused to be controlled, retaliated with false accusations, and framed cadres; some secretly established and developed various reactionary organizations and actively sought out the relationship with special agents; reactionary secret societies, taking advantage of the opportunity of U.S. imperialism spreading bacteria, stirred up trouble and created rumors such as "divine insects" and "holy water" to deceive and intimidate the masses and undermine production. This is one aspect.

On the other hand, U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have been using various methods in the past year to send special agents and spies to the mainland in an attempt to cooperate with the U.S. imperialist's criminal conspiracy to prepare for a new war of aggression. They have many ways of sending special agents and spies, some of whom have infiltrated through various disguises; some of whom have parachuted from airplanes; and some of whom have sneaked in from the sea. The focus of their dispatch and sabotage activities is mainly on key defense areas, railway lines, and factory and mine areas. These special agents and spies who have been sent in will inevitably adopt more vicious, more despicable, and more hidden methods of sabotage, attempting to carry out vicious sabotage against the places that we feel most painful.

The above shows that counter-revolutionaries have suffered extremely serious blows from us. However, it must be pointed out that the remaining counter-revolutionary forces have not been completely eliminated. If anyone thinks that the remaining counter-revolutionaries have been greatly reduced in number compared to the past and can rest easy, that is a big mistake. Because the remaining counter-revolutionaries are generally die-hard lackeys of the U.S. and Chiang. Although their number is small, they will inevitably make a more frantic death struggle. In fact, they are also watching for opportunities to act and harm the people's cause. They are the fierce enemies of the people's China. From another perspective, even if there are only a few counter-revolutionaries, if we lose our vigilance, they may cause us great harm. If we stop here and no longer fight against counter-revolutionaries, then we will just fall into the trap of counter-revolutionaries. Therefore, we must continue to raise our vigilance and continue to crack down on counter-revolutionaries. As long as there are still counter-revolutionaries, we must completely eliminate them.

As we celebrate the third anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, our country's large-scale economic construction is about to begin. All people's public security organs and people's public security personnel throughout the country must always follow Chairman Mao's instructions and continue to carry forward the style of hard struggle and close integration with the masses of the people in this glorious cause, work a hundred times harder, and fulfill their responsibilities. We believe that all the people's public security personnel who have been tempered and strictly tested have the power, the ability, and the confidence to protect the safety of the people's interests and the safety of the country's construction, so that we can move towards new victories on the basis of victory.

    三年来镇压反革命工作的伟大成就
    中央人民政府公安部部长　罗瑞卿
    三年来，人民公安机关在毛主席的英明领导下，在全国范围内进行了镇压反革命的剧烈斗争，并获得伟大成就。这就是：一方面给了蒋介石匪帮残留下来的反革命势力，即：相当大量的土匪、恶霸、特务、反动党团、反动会道门等五个方面的反革命分子以毁灭性的打击；一方面在这个剧烈斗争中，给了广大人民群众以有效的政治教育和阶级教育，提高了广大人民群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。这两个方面的成就，给予我们国家生活的各方面以极其深刻的影响。
    随着中国人民革命战争的伟大胜利，人民民主专政制度在全国范围内普遍建立起来，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的统治永远结束，全国人民开始以主人翁的身份投入建设新生活的斗争。但是，正如毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词所说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”事实证明了毛主席的指示是完全正确的。在全国大陆解放之初，在广大的新解放地区，蒋介石匪帮的反动统治虽然被推翻了，人民民主的政权已经建立起来，但是，在这样的地区，人民的政权和人民的胜利还是不巩固的，还有大量的反革命分子散布在社会的各个角落，进行破坏和捣乱。至于像西南、华南最后解放的地区，有若干地方，情况就更为严重，在一个时候简直是特务猖獗，土匪横行，恶霸分子、反动党团骨干分子以及反动会道门头子则与特务、土匪相勾结，到处进行反抗人民政府的罪恶活动。新解放区的情况是如此。在老解放区，情况当然完全不同。在这里，群众优势早已完全确立，人民民主专政已经巩固。但即在这样的地区，在我们工作比较薄弱的地方和解放较晚的城市，仍有潜伏下来的反革命分子从事破坏活动。当全国范围内反革命活动猖獗的时候，这些潜伏的反革命分子，亦曾进行过性质严重的破坏。这就说明中国人民的革命虽已在全国范围内胜利了，但由于还有大量的反革命分子未被肃清，因而胜利还是不巩固的。于是在中国人民面前就不能不提出一个严重的斗争任务，这就是说：要保卫中国人民已得的胜利和巩固中国人民自己的政权，就绝对不能容忍反革命分子的破坏，对于反革命分子的破坏活动，就不能不采取坚决的镇压。
    本来毛主席早已一再教导我们，对于反革命分子的破坏活动，要保持高度的警惕性。在“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的著名论文中，毛主席又把镇压反革命当作八项根本任务之
    一，提到全党和全国人民面前，指示我们“必须坚决地肃清一切危害人民的土匪、特务、恶霸及其他反革命分子”。可是在一个时期内，我们对于毛主席的指示，是体会得并不深刻的，因而也是执行得不坚决、不彻底的。在解放初期，对于蒋介石匪帮遗留下来的大批反革命分子，我们虽进行过一些搜捕，对于反动党团的骨干分子，在有些城市亦举办过登记工作，还在若干地方取缔过反动会道门的破坏活动，这些工作，都起过一定作用。但由于进行得不够坚决和不够彻底，特别是没有发动群众，因而就没有击中反革命的要害，大量的反革命分子被放过去了。再加上革命在全国范围内的胜利，在我们的广大干部中产生了麻痹思想，对于反革命的复辟阴谋放松了自己的警惕性，在若干地区，对于我们对待反革命应当采取的镇压和宽大相结合的政策，作了错误的片面的了解，以致发生了“宽大无边”的偏向。这实际上等于放纵甚至鼓励了反革命的破坏活动，这也成为解放初期将近大半年时期内反革命能够猖獗一时的重要原因。党和人民政府迅速地发现了并坚决地纠正了这些偏向。从一九五○年十二月开始，在全国范围内逐步展开了大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动。在这一运动中，党和人民政府采取了明确而坚定的方针，进行了巨大规模的关于镇压反革命的宣传活动。广大人民群众控诉、检举和自动捕捉反革命分子的活动，是这一运动的显著特点。因而这次运动不论就消灭反革命分子的效果来说，不论就群众发动的广泛和深入程度来说，不论就运动发展的健康程度来说，都是前所未见的，取得了肃清大量反革命分子的伟大胜利。
    经过大张旗鼓的镇压反革命运动，我们基本上肃清了中国大陆上的反革命残余势力。曾经严重一时的匪祸，已经基本扑灭。现在还残留在一部分偏僻地区的少数土匪，人民公安机关和人民公安部队正在配合人民解放军继续剿捕，短期内即可彻底肃清。某些躲在边境线上或若干海岛上的反革命武装土匪，如果他们没有帝国主义的庇护和支持，那末，他们早已被干净消灭了。另外，我们还消灭了大批的特务分子、恶霸分子以及反动党团、反动会道门中的坚决反革命的分子。这一伟大胜利，大大地加强了人民民主专政的基础。这首先表现在党和人民政府的威信显著提高，同人民群众的关系益趋密切。在严厉镇压反革命以后，人民群众欢声载道，一致称颂党和人民政府的英明措施，使中国人民的胜利巩固了起来。各民主阶级内部，则在镇压反革命运动中更加团结，反革命分子完全陷于孤立，他们的挑拨、破坏阴谋赤裸裸地暴露在广大人民群众面前而归于破产。其次，由于清除了反革命分子，巩固和纯洁了全国各级人民政权，特别是基层人民政权；支援了抗美援朝运动和土地改革运动，以及其他的各种社会改革运动。此外，各民族的关系也因为镇压反革命运动的胜利而进一步改善。若干少数民族地区解放之初，反革命分子曾经利用历史上的民族隔阂，制造了许多谣言，破坏人民政府的民族政策，企图煽惑少数民族人民反对人民政府，甚至企图欺骗和威胁某些少数民族人民参加暴乱。但是，由于人民政府正确地执行了民族政策，并领导少数民族人民，同反革命进行了适当而又坚决的斗争，打击了那些罪大恶极为少数民族多数人民所痛恨的反革命分子，从而就更增进了民族之间的团结。各民族、各民主阶级在对反革命分子斗争中日益增强的团结，乃是保证斗争胜利的基本条件之一。
    镇压反革命工作胜利的更重要的影响，乃是保卫了我们国家的生产恢复和发展工作的顺利进行，并给即将开始的大规模经济建设事业创造了条件。许多地方的群众深切感到，只是在镇压反革命以后，扑灭了反革命的破坏和捣乱，他们才真正获得了解放，他们才真正有了安定的生产和工作的环境，因而生产情绪大大提高。而反革命分子的破坏重点——我们国家的工业与交通，现在也有了比较安全的保障。现在，工业品下乡，农业品进城，已顺畅无阻。为了巩固这些可贵的成果，城乡广大人民建立了数以百万计的治安组织，并正运用他们在镇压反革命运动中已经取得的丰富经验，警惕地保卫着生产建设的安全。这样，即将开始的大规模经济建设事业，就有了可靠的保障。
    镇压反革命工作所以获得这样伟大的成就，主要原因是：
    第一、我们集中力量打击了那些罪大恶极、怙恶不悛、为人民群众所十分痛恨的反革命首恶分子，而对于罪恶尚不十分严重而又愿意改悔的反革命分子，则采取了宽大处理的方针，甚至对那些按其罪行是应该处死的反革命分子，如果他们没有血债，民愤不大，或者他们对国家利益的损害尚未达到最严重的程度，还采取了判处死刑、缓期执行、强迫劳动、以观后效的政策，给他们以最后改悔的机会。我们对于罪大恶极的反革命首要分子，毫不动摇地采取坚决镇压的方针，狠狠地打击他们，这是完全必要的。也只有痛击这些反革命分子，并改造一切可能改造的反革命分子，才能彻底扑灭反革命的凶焰，摧毁反革命的组织，消灭反革命分子危害国家和人民的可能性。
    第二、我们走了群众路线，放手发动了群众，吸引各界人士参加了镇压反革命的工作，大张旗鼓地广泛深入地进行了宣传，真正达到了“家喻户晓，人人明白”的地步。特别由于镇压反革命工作通过了各界人民代表会议和协商委员会，因而使运动吸引和联系了更加广大的群众。这样就使镇压反革命工作成为人民群众和人民政府的共同行动，取得了广大人民群众的拥护和支持，克服了镇压反革命工作中的关门主义和神秘主义，并使罪大恶极为人民群众所痛恨的反革命分子更加孤立，更加暴露。
    在较短时期内我们能够消灭了大量的反革命分子，保证了运动的健康和胜利，这是因为我们毫不动摇地坚持了正确的方针和大胆地相信并依靠了群众的力量。
    第三、我们的镇压反革命工作，是有领导的。这不仅表现在有了对待反革命的明确政策，而且有了“中华人民共和国惩治反革命条例”作为具体量刑的标准。对于捕人和判刑，都是以反革命的罪证作根据。都有着严格的控制和精密的审查。特别是毛主席的密切指导，对镇压反革命工作的正确发展，是有决定意义的。
    第四、各级人民公安机关对于镇压反革命工作，一般是有经验的，也是有准备的。事先一般地都进行了比较充分的调查研究，取得了可靠的材料和证据；而且在工作过程中，采取了谨慎小心的态度，随时都保持着清醒的头脑，警惕着可能发生的偏差。各级人民检察机关、各级人民司法机关、人民法庭和军法机关，对于反革命案件的检察、审讯和判处，也都是极其审慎和极其严肃的。所有这些，就保证了我们能够确实作到既不会放过一个反革命分子，也不会冤屈一个好人。
    中国人民经过三年斗争，已经基本上肃清了残留下来的大量的反革命分子，但是，由于镇压反革命运动在各地进行的时间不同，我们的工作也有先后不同，因此打击反革命分子的轻重程度仍有区别。就全国情况来看，除了少数地方至今还没有大张旗鼓地进行镇压反革命，反革命分子还没有受到应有的打击以外，即在已经大张旗鼓地进行了镇压反革命的地区，也还有彻底、基本彻底或者基本不彻底之分。就是已经进行得彻底的地区，也还有若干漏网的反革命分子，逍遥法外，为非作恶。因此从全国的各种地区来看，散布在各个角落的反革命分子仍有一定的数量。这些反革命分子一遇风吹草动，就又蠢蠢欲动。例如当各地人民政府正忙于领导
    “三反”、“五反”运动的时候，当美帝国主义在东北等地撒布细菌的时候，他们就认为有隙可乘，又进行各种破坏活动。有的造谣挑拨，破坏“三反”运动；有的不服管制，反噬诬告，陷害干部；有的秘密建立和发展各种反动组织，积极找寻特务领导关系；反动会道门，则利用美帝国主义撒布细菌的机会，兴风作浪，制造“神虫”“圣水”等等的谣言，欺骗和恐吓群众，破坏生产。这是一方面。
    另一方面，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮，近一年来，利用各种方式向大陆派遣特务间谍，以图配合美帝国主义准备新的侵略战争的罪恶阴谋。他们派遣特务间谍的方法很多，有的是经过各种伪装混进来的；有的是从飞机上跳伞降下来的；有的是偷偷摸摸从海里爬进来的。他们派遣和进行破坏活动的重点，主要是国防要地、铁路沿线和工厂矿山地区。这些派遣进来的特务间谍分子，他们必然会采取更加毒辣、更加卑鄙、更加隐蔽的破坏手段，企图对准我们最感痛楚的地方实行凶恶的破坏。
    上述这些，说明反革命分子已经受到了我们极其严重的打击。但是，必须指出，反革命残余力量还没有完全肃清，如果有人以为残存的反革命分子既然在数量上比之过去已经大大减少，就可以高枕无忧了，那是极大的错误。因为现在残存的反革命分子，一般是死心塌地的美蒋爪牙。他们的数量虽少，但必然要作更加疯狂的垂死挣扎。事实上，他们也在伺隙活动，危害人民事业。他们是人民中国的凶恶敌人。从另一方面看，即令是少数的反革命分子，如果我们丧失了警惕，也可能给我们以极大的危害。如果我们就此住手，不再向反革命作斗争，那我们就恰恰中了反革命的奸计。因此，我们必须继续提高警惕性，必须继续打击反革命。只要还有反革命分子存在，我们就要彻底消灭它。
    当我们庆祝中华人民共和国成立三周年的时候，我们国家的大规模经济建设事业即将开始。全国的
    一切人民公安机关和人民公安人员，必须随时遵循着毛主席的指示，必须在这一光荣的事业中，继续发扬坚苦奋斗、密切结合人民群众的作风，百倍努力，克尽自己的职责。我们相信，经过长期锻炼和严格考验的全体人民公安人员，完全有力量、有能力、有信心保卫人民利益的安全，保卫祖国建设事业的安全，使我们在胜利的基础上走向新的胜利。
