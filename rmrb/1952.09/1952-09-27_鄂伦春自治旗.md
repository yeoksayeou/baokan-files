    Oroqen Autonomous Banner
    By Our Correspondent Shen Shi
    In the room of Batu Bao Yin, a teacher at the Oroqen Autonomous Banner Elementary School, a young Oroqen girl is playing the harmonium. Several children surround her, wearing red scarves, singing joyfully to the music, singing about the Xing'an Mountains forest, singing about Chairman Mao, singing about the happy life of the Oroqen people today.
    When the singing stops, Batu Bao Yin shows me the students' work. This is a poem written jointly by third-grade students Arta Ni and Kurtu Ni, praising Chairman Mao:
    Who led us to stand up?
    The great leader, Chairman Mao.
    We must not forget Chairman Mao's kindness,
    He gave us a paradise—elementary school.
    We miss you, we love you,
    We love you as we love the sun and moon.
    The children's poem expresses the heartfelt wishes of all the Oroqen people. The Oroqen people, who have endured slavery and oppression for generations, have not only been freed from all slavery and oppression in the Mao Zedong era, but have also received material and cultural support that they never dreamed of before. How could they not be overjoyed?
    The girl playing the harmonium in Batu Bao Yin's room is named Arong Kuo. One sunny day, the elementary school principal, Geng Gen Tuole Gu'er, and I visited Arong Kuo's home in Nuomin Sumu (Sumu is equivalent to a district). Arong Kuo and her two older sisters live with their uncle; they are orphans. Their parents and brothers were all killed by the typhoid germs spread by the Japanese imperialists in the past. Nuomin Sumu originally had more than 150 Oroqen people, but after that incident, only more than 50 people were left. After liberation, the three Arong Kuo sisters were admitted to Oroqen Autonomous Banner Elementary School free of charge. They have completed the fifth grade and will enter Zhalantun Nawen Middle School free of charge next semester. Their experiences before and after liberation represent the experiences of ordinary Oroqen youths and children. The Oroqen Autonomous Banner currently has two middle school students, and this autumn, eight fifth-grade elementary school students will be promoted to middle school, increasing the number of middle school students in the banner to ten. The autonomous banner elementary school has seventy-six students, accounting for about one-tenth of the banner's population. All these students attend school free of charge. This is unprecedented in the history of the Oroqen people.
    The Oroqen Autonomous Banner has a population of eight hundred and nine, of which seven hundred and forty-seven are Oroqen people. The Oroqen people have implemented regional autonomy in their settlements, established their own government, and have their own banner head and cadres. Although these cadres are still somewhat unfamiliar with leading the political, economic, and cultural life of the banner's eight hundred people, they have made many achievements in nearly a year of work. Xiao'ergou used to be a wilderness, but now it has the newly built office of the banner government, a cooperative, a clinic, an auditorium, and a sports field, and more than one hundred workers are rushing to build elementary school buildings. In Gangkui and Tuozhaming Sumu, the income of hunters is increasing year by year. In addition to meat, rice and flour have become regular food. They can add two or three new sets of clothes a year. Most of them are members of the cooperative. The cooperative purchases their furs, deer antlers, and bear bile at fair prices, and supplies them with grain, salt, gunpowder, and daily necessities. The days when private merchants exploited their deer antlers, deer fetuses, lynx, otters, etc. at extremely low prices are gone forever.
    The Japanese imperialists once attempted to eliminate the Oroqen people with opium; for men and women over the age of twenty, they were forced to allocate at least one fen of opium per person per day, and up to three fen. During that period, many Oroqen people became physically weak due to opium addiction. Coupled with diseases such as smallpox, malaria, typhoid fever, cholera, and relapsing fever, the entire Oroqen people were left with only more than two thousand people by the time of liberation. After liberation, the vast majority of them quit opium. The People's Government gives them free vaccinations every year and conducts preventive injections for diseases such as typhoid fever and cholera. During the hunting season, doctors from the banner clinic travel back and forth in the Xing'an Mountains forest with medicines to treat patients. Gangkui and Tuozhaming Sumu also have midwives to deliver babies for pregnant women. Now, the population of this ethnic group has stopped declining, and the population of Gangkui Sumu has begun to rise.
    Bai Sigulang, the young banner head of the Oroqen Banner, is a vigorous and energetic person. He came to Beijing last year to participate in a meeting convened by the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission. He told me that when he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao in front of Tiananmen Square, when he sat with representatives of all fraternal ethnic groups in the country to discuss major issues of all ethnic groups, when he stepped on the train of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and saw the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, and received the warm welcome and hospitality of the people in Shanghai and other places, he was so excited that he couldn't sleep. When he returned to Xiao'ergou and told the Oroqen people what he had seen and heard in Beijing and Shanghai, everyone was as excited and jubilant as he was. Beijing, Shanghai, the Forbidden City, and the Summer Palace were places that everyone never dreamed of being able to visit. But now, not only can they visit, but they are also treated with brotherly warmth, hospitality and welcome. Bai Sigulang said that this is an earth-shaking change. This change has made the Oroqen people begin to love their motherland. They sing like this:
    We who have lived in the deep mountains for generations,
    Only with Chairman Mao did we see the light of day!
    How to love our savior, Chairman Mao,
    How to support our loved ones, the volunteer soldiers,
    Protect the forests of the motherland well,
    Protect them like our own children.
    In order to protect the great forest of the Xing'an Mountains, the People's Congress of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner has discussed and adopted a resolution on fire prevention and forest protection to protect the property of the motherland. This resolution is being earnestly implemented. In the past year, there has not been a single forest fire in the entire banner.
    The Oroqen Autonomous Banner has natural resources: the forests of the Greater Xing'an Mountains run through the entire territory; there are also many underground mineral deposits; the turbulent Nuomin and Kuile rivers can be used to generate a large amount of electricity. This is endless potential for the construction of the Oroqen Autonomous Banner. Banner Head Bai Sigulang said to me: "We have the help of advanced ethnic brothers, rich natural resources, and the bravery and hard work of our ethnic group. We are fully confident in developing our construction undertakings. The next time you come, you will definitely see more new things here."

    鄂伦春自治旗
    本报记者　沈石
    鄂伦春自治旗小学校教师巴图宝音的房里，有一位年轻的鄂伦春族姑娘正在弹奏风琴。她的周围站着几个小孩，小孩们围着红领巾，伴着琴声欢欣地歌唱，歌唱兴安岭森林，歌唱毛主席，歌唱鄂伦春人今天的幸福生活。
    歌声停止，巴图宝音拿出学生的作品给我看。这是三年级小学生阿尔塔尼和库尔图尼合写的歌颂毛主席的诗：
    谁领导我们翻了身？
    伟大的领袖毛主席。
    毛主席的恩情不能忘掉，
    他让我们有了乐园——小学校。
    我们想念您，我们热爱您，
    像爱日月那样热爱您。
    孩子们的诗，道出了全体鄂伦春族人民的心声。世世代代忍受着奴役与压榨的鄂伦春族人民，在毛泽东时代，不仅摆脱了一切奴役与压榨，并且受到了以前梦想不到的物质与文化方面的扶植，他们怎能不欢欣鼓舞呢？
    在巴图宝音房里弹风琴的那位姑娘名叫阿荣括。一个晴朗的日子，我和小学校长格根托勒古尔到诺敏苏木（苏木相当于区），访问了阿荣括的家。阿荣括和她的两个姐姐寄居在舅父家里，她们是孤儿。她们的父母兄弟，都被过去日本帝国主义散布的伤寒病菌杀死了。诺敏苏木原有鄂伦春族人民一百五十余人，那次被害得只剩了五十余人。解放后，阿荣括姐妹三人免费进了鄂伦春自治旗小学，她们已经读完了五年级，下期将免费进入扎兰屯纳文中学。她们在解放前后的遭遇，代表着一般鄂伦春族青年、儿童的遭遇。鄂伦春自治旗现有中学生两名，今年秋季将有八名小学五年级生升入中学，使全旗的中学生增到十名。自治旗小学有学生七十六名，约占全旗人口十分之一。这些学生，都是免费上学的。这是鄂伦春民族历史上未曾有过的事。
    鄂伦春自治旗居民八百零九人，鄂伦春人占七百四十七名。鄂伦春人在他们聚居的地区实行了区域自治，建立了自己的政府，有了自己的旗长和干部。尽管这些干部对于领导全旗八百多人的政治、经济、文化生活还有些生疏，但将近一年的工作是取得许多成绩的。小二沟过去是一片荒原，现在有了旗政府新建的办公处所，有了合作社，诊疗所，礼堂和球场，还有一百多工人正在赶建小学校舍。在甘奎、托扎明苏木，猎民们的收入一年年增多，除肉食外，大米、白面已经成为经常的食粮。他们一年能添两三套新衣。他们大都是合作社的社员。合作社用公道的价钱收购他们的皮张、鹿茸和熊胆等，并将粮食、食盐、火药和日用品源源地供给他们。过去私商以极低的价钱榨取他们的鹿茸、鹿胎、猞猁、水獭等的日子已经一去不复返了。
    日本帝国主义者曾经企图用鸦片来消灭鄂伦春民族；对于二十岁以上的男女，每人每天最少强迫配给鸦片一分，最多达三分。那时期，许多鄂伦春人因为吸食鸦片而身体衰弱了。加上天花、疟疾、伤寒、霍乱、回归热等疾病，整个鄂伦春民族到解放时只剩下二千余人。解放以后，他们绝大多数戒绝了鸦片。人民政府每年给他们免费种痘，进行伤寒、霍乱等疾病的预防注射。行猎期间，旗诊疗所的医生带着药品，来回奔跑于兴安岭森林中，给病人治疗。甘奎、托扎明苏木还有助产士给孕妇接产。现在，这一民族的人口已经停止下降，甘奎苏木的人口则已开始上升。
    鄂伦春旗的年轻旗长白斯古郎，是一个朝气勃勃的人。去年曾来北京参加中央民族事务委员会召开的会议。他告诉我，当他在天安门前见到毛主席像的时候，当他和全国各兄弟民族的代表们坐在一起商讨各民族的大事的时候，当他踏上京沪铁路的火车见到祖国秀丽的河山，受到上海等地人民热情欢迎和招待的时候，他激动得觉都睡不着。当他回到小二沟，将他在北京、上海的所见所闻告诉鄂伦春人的时候，大家都和他一样兴奋，欢欣鼓舞。北京、上海、故宫、颐和园，这是大家过去做梦也想不到能去游一游的。但是，现在不仅能游，而且受到兄弟般的热情招待与欢迎。白斯古郎说，这是翻天覆地的大变化。这种变化，使鄂伦春族的人民开始热爱自己的祖国。他们这样歌唱：
    辈辈生活在深山里的我们哪，
    有了毛主席才见了青天！
    怎样热爱我们的救星毛主席，
    怎样支援我们的亲人志愿军，
    把祖国的森林好好保护，
    像自己的亲儿女一样保护。
    为了保护兴安岭的大森林，鄂伦春自治旗的人民代表会议曾经讨论通过防火护林、保护祖国财产的决议。这一决议被认真地执行着。一年来全旗没有发生过一次森林火灾。
    鄂伦春自治旗有着天然的富源：大兴安岭的森林纵横全境；地下的矿藏也很多；湍急的诺敏、奎勒等河流，可以利用来大量发电。这对建设鄂伦春自治旗是无尽的潜力。旗长白斯古郎对我说：“我们有着先进民族兄弟般的帮助，有着丰富的自然资源，加上我们民族的勇敢勤劳，我们完全有信心发展我们的建设事业。在你下次来时，你一定会看到这里有更多的新事物。”
