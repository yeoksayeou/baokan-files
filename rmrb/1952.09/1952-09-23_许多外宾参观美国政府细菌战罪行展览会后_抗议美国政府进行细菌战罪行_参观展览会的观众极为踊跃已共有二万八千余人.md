Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: During the preview period of the "Exhibition on U.S. Government’s Bacteriological Warfare Crimes," organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, more than 600 foreign guests were invited to visit. They carefully questioned the guides about each piece of evidence displayed, and many took notes. After the visit, some guests made statements on the spot, while others wrote down their opinions, protesting against the U.S. government's germ warfare.

Professor Bressau (Brazil), a member of the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China, who visited the exhibition not long ago, wrote in the comments book: "After visiting the exhibition aimed at exposing the substantive evidence of the bacteriological warfare crimes committed by U.S. war criminals against the Korean and Chinese people, I admire the objective and organized arrangement of the exhibition. Although this exhibition takes a mass form, the revelation of all facts conforms to a high scientific point of view, without exaggeration or excess, with the sole purpose of explaining the truth and the real situation. I only regret that the excellent technology and talent in arranging the exhibition are only used to expose a dirty and evil deed. Only when there is true peace and cooperation in the world, will technology be fully used to popularize science and promote the heroic deeds of peace warriors, which will inevitably occupy an important page in human history in the future."

Sanz, a representative from Costa Rica participating in the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, wrote: "I have seen evidence and documents regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by a country that considers itself civilized. On behalf of the millions of men and women in this country who will be shocked when they see the crimes committed by their people, and on behalf of all the people on the planet who find these methods of warfare guilty, after seeing this evidence, I want to loudly express my protest and indignation. Germ warfare is an insult to so-called Western civilization, and we must stop it and expose it everywhere."

Foreign guests who visited the exhibition earlier also expressed their opinions:

Salalankara, a Buddhist and trade union representative from Ceylon who attended the "May Day" celebrations in our country, said: "This exhibition made us understand that U.S. imperialism is carrying out such cruel bacteriological warfare. My heart is filled with anger towards this inhumane behavior of the United States. We oppose bacteriological warfare not only for the people of Korea and China, not only for the people of Asia, but also to save the lives of people all over the world. I represent the people, workers, and Buddhists of Ceylon in protesting against the bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism."

Subijanto, chairman of the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union delegation, wrote:
"After seeing the facts and evidence of the bacteriological warfare conducted by U.S. imperialism to slaughter the human race, we, representing the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union, which has 2.5 million worker members, express here that we will strengthen our protest from the All-Indonesia Central Labor Union and do our best to mobilize the broad masses of Indonesian people to condemn the inhuman bacteriological warfare carried out by U.S. imperialism in Northeast China and Korea."

Mr. and Mrs. Flett, members of the Australian delegation who came to China to attend the International Conference for the Defense of Children, wrote: "This is the most convincing and informative exhibition I have ever seen. I don't think anyone can walk out of this exhibition hall without being completely convinced that the U.S. imperialists are waging bacteriological warfare against the Chinese and Korean people."

John Johnson, Dean of Canterbury, England, who was invited to visit China, said:
"It is shameful that the name of a country, especially a Christian country, is linked to this matter. These things must be exposed and condemned. I am very reluctant to see such things, and I don't want such things to happen in the world. However, since such things are happening, we have to face the facts. We must work hard to make the United States stop using bacteriological weapons."

Representatives from many countries who participated in the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference also wrote down their opinions:

Mary Jennison, Executive Secretary of the Canadian Peace Congress, wrote:
"Our responsibility to convey these facts to the West is even more obvious today. If the people of our country can believe what the people of Korea and China have encountered, they will unanimously demand that the U.S. war-mongers stop their anti-people crimes."

Shadar Gul Bakshi Singh, a representative from India, wrote: "I have seen this exhibition. I have seen these reports in the newspaper and believe that the war criminals have committed these crimes. After seeing the evidence exhibited here, the fragments of bombs, and the confessions of the two American prisoners, all my doubts have been dispelled. I am very angry about this inhumane crime."

Jorge Bayona, a representative from Colombia, wrote: "After visiting the bacteriological warfare exhibition, I reaffirmed my accusation: the imperialist government of the United States of North America and the U.S. military command in Korea should be held responsible for the crimes of bacteriological warfare. The documents I saw in the exhibition are undeniable, and they can make the people of all countries firmly believe that those responsible for the bacteriological warfare in Korea should be tried in the court of the people of all countries, just like the former Nazi war criminals."

Diaz, a representative from El Salvador, wrote: "This exhibition most conclusively exposes the methods used by the U.S. military to carry out bacteriological warfare. After seeing it, I am fully convinced of the proof of various evidences, and I am convinced that the U.S. government, the military command, and scientists have committed enormous and terrible crimes against humanity. No punishment is sufficient to satisfy the anger caused by these crimes."

John Kingsbury, a representative from the United States, watched and talked during his visit. When he saw the huge banner "Exhibition on U.S. Government’s Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" at the entrance of the exhibition, he specifically repeated the word "crimes," and then said, "This is shameful!" After listening to the recordings of U.S. Air Force prisoners of war Inak and Quinn, he said, "This is undeniable evidence."

Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The "Exhibition on U.S. Government’s Bacteriological Warfare Crimes" organized by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace has been extremely popular since its official opening on the 15th of this month. As of the 20th, 6,308 people have visited the exhibition. Including the number of people who visited during the preview period, the total number of visitors is 28,056, and the total number of registered visitors has reached 86,988.

At present, in addition to cadres from various central government agencies, the audience of the exhibition also includes representatives from various democratic parties and from various places who come to Beijing for meetings. Many people left their opinions in the comments book after the visit.

Shao Lizi, Standing Committee Member of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, wrote in the comments book: "From this exhibition, we can see that we have the power to defeat the bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism. The methods of display and explanation are very good, and the comrades who explain have true enthusiasm."

Liang Shuming, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, wrote: "After seeing it, I believe that the Chinese people are determined to have the strength to smash the bacteriological warfare of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, we support the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference to organize the people's strength in this region and safeguard world peace."

Li Zhuangyou, from the Xi'an representative group of the September 3rd Society, wrote: "The ironclad facts fully demonstrate that U.S. imperialism has spread germs and conducted bacteriological warfare in Korea and various parts of Northeast China. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao of the Chinese Communist Party, we are determined to do a good job in the patriotic health campaign and take practical actions to deal with the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism."

Zhang Shengli of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions wrote: "I hope to popularize and deepen this education (referring to the exhibition) throughout China."

Overseas Chinese student Chen Huizhu wrote: "After seeing the exhibition, I really have indescribable anger in my heart… I am determined to turn anger into strength, study hard, exercise my body well, and powerfully strike at U.S. imperialism."

Volunteer Army representative Zhang Hai wrote: "From the specific visit and explanation, I have a deeper understanding of the evil deeds of U.S. imperialism in spreading germs, and it has further aroused my hatred for U.S. imperialism. After returning to the front, I will take practical actions, with greater victories in work and combat, to strike at U.S. imperialism and strive for the complete victory in the anti-bacteriological warfare and the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea."

    许多外宾参观美国政府细菌战罪行展览会后
    抗议美国政府进行细菌战罪行
    参观展览会的观众极为踊跃已共有二万八千余人
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会举办的美国政府细菌战罪行展览会在预展期间，有六百多外宾应邀参观展览会。他们仔细地向解说员询问陈列的每一种罪证，许多外宾还做了笔记。外宾们在参观后，有的在当时发表了谈话，有的写下意见，抗议美国政府进行细菌战。
    不久以前参观展览会的调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会委员贝索亚教授（巴西）在意见簿上写道：“在参观了旨在揭露美国战犯对朝中人民所进行的细菌战的实质罪证的展览会之后，我对于展览会布置得这样的客观与有条有理表示钦佩。虽然这个展览会具有群众性的形式，但是一切事实的揭示都符合着高度的科学观点，丝毫不夸大，不过分，目的只在说明真理，说明真实情况。我只叹息布置展览会的大好技术与才能仅用于揭露
    一个污秽的罪恶的勾当。只有等待世界上有了真正的和平与合作以后，那时技术才可以充分用在普及科学及宣扬和平战士的英勇事迹方面，这些在将来必然占着人类历史上重要的一页。”
    参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的哥斯达黎加代表圣兹写道：“我看到了关于一个自认为文明的国家使用细菌武器的证据和文件。我代替这个国家的千百万当看到他们的人干下的这个罪行时将会大为震惊的男男女女，代替全地球觉得这些战争方式有罪的人们，看过了这些证据，我要高声说出我的抗议和愤慨。细菌战是对所谓西方文明的一种侮辱，我们要制止它，到处揭露它。”
    前此参观展览会的外宾，也都纷纷发表意见：
    参加我国“五一”节观礼的锡兰工会代表佛教徒撒拉南卡拉说：“这个展览会使我们了解了美帝国主义正在进行这样残酷的细菌战。对美国这种无人道的行为，我的心里充满了愤恨。我们反对细菌战不仅是为朝鲜和中国人民，不仅是为亚洲人民，而且也是为了挽救全世界人民的生命。我代表锡兰的人民、工人和佛教徒抗议美帝国主义的细菌战。”
    全印尼中央职工会代表团主席苏比延多写道：
    “看了美帝国主义这种屠杀世界人类所进行的细菌战的事实与证据之后，我们代表拥有二百五十万工人会员的全印尼中央职工会在这里表示我们要加强我们全印尼中央职工会的抗议，并尽力地发动广大印尼群众来谴责美帝国主义在中国东北及朝鲜所进行的无人性的细菌战。”
    出席国际保卫儿童大会来我国参观的澳大利亚代表团团员佛勒特夫妇写道：“这是我看过的最有说服力与材料丰富的展览会，我觉得没有任何人能走出这个展览室而不完全信服美帝国主义者在向中朝人民发动着细菌战争。”
    应邀来我国参观的英国坎特伯雷教长约翰逊说：
    “一个国家，特别是一个基督教国家的名字，跟这个事情连在一起是可耻的。这些事情必需暴露、声讨。我很不愿意看这样事情，也不愿意世界上有这样事情。但是，事实上有这样事情发生，我们只好面对事实。我们一定要努力使美国停止使用细菌武器。”
    参加亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备会议的许多国家的代表，也曾写下自己的意见：
    加拿大和平大会执行秘书玛丽·詹尼逊写道：
    “我们把这些事实传到西方的责任，今天越加明显。假若我们国家人民能相信朝鲜及中国人民所遭遇到的事情，他们必会一致要求美国的战争贩子们停止他们反人民的罪行。”
    印度代表沙达尔·古尔·巴克希·辛格写道：“我已经看过这个展览。在报上曾看过这些报告，而相信战犯们是犯有这些罪行的。又看了在这里展览的这些证据，炸弹的碎片与两个美俘供词以后，打消了我一切怀疑。我对这种无人性的罪行是非常忿怒的。”
    哥伦比亚代表乔治·巴约纳写道：“我参观了细菌战展览之后，我重新肯定我的指责：北美合众国帝国主义政府和朝鲜美军军事统帅部应对细菌战的罪行负责。我在展览会中看到的文件是无可抵赖的，它可以使各国人民确凿地相信，对朝鲜细菌战负责的人们应在各国人民的法庭上受审判，就像从前纳粹战犯一样。”
    萨尔瓦多代表第亚斯写道：“这个展览会里面，最确凿地暴露出美国军队实行细菌战的方式。我看了以后，完全确信了各种证据的证明，确信美国政府、军队统帅部和科学家们犯下了反对人类的巨大的恐怖的罪行，没有任何一种惩罚足以满足这种罪行所引起的愤怒。”
    美国代表约翰·金斯伯利在参观时边看边谈。他在展览会的入口处看到“美国政府细菌战罪行展览”的巨幅时，特别把“罪行”二字重念了一次，接着说：“这是可耻的呀！”在听完美国空军战俘伊纳克和奎恩的录音后，他说：“这就是不容抵赖的证据。”
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会举办的美国政府细菌战罪行展览会，自本月十五日正式揭幕以来，观众极为踊跃。迄二十日止，已有六千三百零八人参观展览会。连同预展期间参观的人数共有二万八千零五十六人，登记参观的总人数已达八万六千九百八十八人。
    展览会的观众，目前除中央各机关的干部外，还包括各民主党派以及各地来北京开会的代表等。许多人参观后，都在意见簿上留下意见。
    中国国民党革命委员会常务委员邵力子在意见簿上写道：“从这个展览会，就可看出我们有战胜美帝国主义细菌战的力量。陈列和讲解的方法都很好，讲解的同志都具有真正的热诚。”
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员梁漱溟写道：“看了后，相信中国人民决定有力量粉碎美帝国主义细菌战。同时，我们拥护召开亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，以组织这区域的人民力量，维护世界和平。”
    九三学社西安代表组李壮猷写道：“铁的事实完全说明了美帝国主义在朝鲜及我国东北各地撒布细菌进行细菌战争。我们决心在中国共产党毛主席的英明领导下，搞好爱国卫生运动，以实际行动对付美帝国主义的灭绝人性的滔天罪行。”
    湖南省总工会张生力写道：“希望把这种教育（指展览会），普及深入到全中国。”
    华侨学生陈慧珠写道：“看完了展览会后，我的心里真有说不出的愤怒。……我决心化愤怒为力量，努力学习，锻炼好身体，有力的打击美帝国主义。”
        志愿军代表张海写道：“从具体参观和讲述中，使我更深刻的了解美帝国主义撒布细菌的罪恶行为，更加激起我对美帝国主义的仇恨。回前方后，要以实际行动，以工作、战斗更大的胜利，来打击美帝国主义，以争取反细菌战及抗美援朝斗争的彻底胜利。”
