Archaeological Staff Training Class Established

In order to train archaeological and cultural relic personnel, and to protect ancient tombs and cultural relic sites discovered in large-scale construction projects throughout the country, the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Bureau of Social Cultural Affairs of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, and Peking University jointly established an "Archaeological Staff Training Class." The class officially started on August 11. There are a total of seventy-two students, most of whom are young cadres transferred from major administrative regions across the country. The study period is three months: two months of lectures and one month of field practice.

Guo Moruo, Deputy Premier of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and Shen Yanbing, Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, attached great importance to the establishment of this training class and personally delivered reports at the opening ceremony. Deputy Premier Guo called on all teachers and students to complete the teaching tasks with the spirit of Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method.

The "Archaeological Staff Training Class" adopted an image teaching method. Based on the combination of lectures and practice, students engaged in mutual study through group discussions and collective review. Each study group formulated a study covenant to ensure that they would learn well. The teachers organized "Teaching Research Groups" and "Teaching Research Subgroups." Each unit of the course was collectively researched before one person was recommended to give the lecture. Whether teaching or learning, the spirit of Qi Jianhua's rapid literacy method was implemented, with the expectation that students would master the spirit of policies and laws on the protection of cultural relics within three months, understand basic knowledge of cultural relics, and initially learn the techniques and methods of field archaeology. After returning to their respective regions, they would be able to take on the work of protecting cultural relics and the responsibility of publicizing relevant laws on the protection of cultural relics.

    考古工作人员训练班成立
    为了培养考古、文物工作人员，保护全国各地大规模建设工程中所发现的古墓葬、古文化遗址，中国科学院考古研究所，中央文化部社会文化事业管理局和北京大学合办了一个“考古工作人员训练班”。该班已于八月十一日正式上课。学员共七十二人，其中绝大部分是从全国各大行政区调来的青年干部。学习期间共三个月：听讲两个月，田野实习一个月。
    中央人民政府政务院郭沫若副总理、中央文化部沈雁冰部长，对于这个训练班的开办都很重视，曾亲自在开学典礼上做过报告；郭副总理对全体师生发出号召，要以祁建华速成识字法的精神完成教学任务。
    “考古工作人员训练班”采取了形象教学法。学员们在听讲与实习相结合的基础上，通过小组讨论和集体温课，彼此互相钻研。各个学习小组都订立了学习公约，保证一定要学好。教员们组织了“教学研究小组”“教学研究分组”，每一个单元的课程，都是经过集体研究后公推一人讲课。无论教和学，都贯彻着祁建华速成识字法的精神，以期学员们在三个月内能掌握关于保护文物的政策法令的精神，懂得文物常识，初步学会田野考古的技术和方法；回到各地区后，能担负起保护文物的工作，以及宣传有关保护文物的法令的责任。
