Comrades of the Chinese Farmers' Representative Visiting Delegation:

Today, on behalf of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, the North China General Branch, and the Beijing Branch, I extend the warmest welcome to all comrades of the Chinese Farmers' Representative Visiting Delegation! We warmly welcome you because you represent the largest majority of the Chinese people – the Chinese working farmers. You have completed the glorious task of visiting the great friendly country of the Soviet Union and the Soviet working farmers, and you have successfully conveyed the Chinese working farmers' high respect and friendship to the Soviet working people. We warmly welcome you because you have victoriously completed the glorious task assigned to you by the Party and higher authorities, and have thoroughly studied the rich experience of Soviet farmers in agricultural collectivization and advanced agricultural scientific knowledge. We warmly welcome you because you are about to undertake the glorious task of widely publicizing what you have learned in the Soviet Union to our country's farmers.

I have already heard that during your nearly four-month visit to the Soviet Union, you have gained extremely rich harvests. There is an old Chinese saying: "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." This time you went to the Soviet Union and truly saw the benefits of Soviet agricultural collectivization with your own eyes. You visited many collective farms, state farms, and agricultural machinery stations in the Soviet Union, which was the best learning experience for you. This study can solve many problems in the development of agricultural production in our country. Because Soviet agricultural science and technology are the most advanced in the world. We can only rapidly develop agricultural production by diligently and continuously learning from the advanced experience of Soviet agricultural collectivization.

You could see in the Soviet Union how prosperous the lives of Soviet farmers are. This happy life of Soviet farmers is the result of long-term arduous struggle under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin; and only through the path of agricultural collectivization can there be such a happy life.

This time, you received an extremely warm welcome and hospitality from the Soviet people in the Soviet Union, which is the most vivid internationalist education. We know that the Soviet people have always been the most loyal friends of the Chinese people in the past and present. The victory of the Chinese revolution and the current national construction work have received enthusiastic and selfless assistance from the Soviet people. In the future, we will rely even more on the help of the Soviet people in carrying out national industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Therefore, strengthening the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet people and strengthening our own internationalist education is a very important task at present.

Comrades, the path of Soviet agricultural collectivization is the path that Chinese farmers will take. Our agricultural producers' cooperatives are a preliminary form of collectivization. However, Chairman Mao instructed us: "The serious problem is educating the peasants." This very arduous but also very glorious responsibility must first fall on the shoulders of you, the representatives, because you are all nationally renowned labor models and outstanding cadres in agricultural work. With the advent of large-scale national industrial construction, in-depth and specific collectivization education must be carried out among the peasants. You should conduct vivid publicity and education to the broad masses of farmers about the facts you have witnessed in the Soviet Union. The publicity must be combined with the specific conditions of our country and with Sino-Soviet friendship and internationalism. At the same time, I hope that you will closely contact the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations at all levels when carrying out publicity and promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to every corner of the vast rural areas of our country.

Comrades! You have already had very rich experience in agricultural production in the past, and now you have learned the advanced agricultural production experience of the Soviet Union. You will certainly be able to complete this glorious task. I warmly congratulate you on your new achievements on the production front of the motherland, and congratulate you on your new successes in exchanging the friendship and experience of the working farmers of China and the Soviet Union!

Long live the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao!

Long live the leader of the working people of the world, the Chinese people's most beloved teacher and friend – Marshal Stalin!

Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    中苏友协总会副会长吴玉章的欢迎词中国农民代表参观团全体同志们：
    今天我代表中苏友好协会总会、华北总分会及北京市分会，向中国农民代表参观团的全体同志致最热烈的欢迎！我们热烈地欢迎你们，是因为你们代表了中国人民中的最大多数——中国的劳动农民，完成了访问伟大的友邦苏联和苏联劳动农民的光荣任务，你们圆满地传达了中国劳动农民对苏联劳动人民的崇高敬意和友谊。我们热烈地欢迎你们，是因为你们胜利地完成了党和上级交给你们的光荣任务，很好地学习了苏联农民农业集体化的丰富经验和先进的农业科学知识。我们热烈地欢迎你们，是因为你们将要负担起把你们在苏联学到的东西，广泛地向我国农民进行宣传的光荣任务。
    我已经听说了：在这次你们访问苏联将近四个月的时间中，得到了极为丰富的收获。中国有句老话说：“百闻不如一见”，这次你们去到苏联，就真真实实地亲眼看到了苏联农业集体化的好处。你们在苏联参观了许多集体农场、国营农场、农业机器站，这对于你们是一次最好的学习。在这次学习中可以解决我国发展农业生产的许多问题。因为苏联的农业科学技术，是世界上最先进的。我们只有好好地不断地学习苏联农业集体化的先进经验，才可以很快地发展农业生产。
    你们在苏联可以看到：苏联农民的生活是如何的富裕。苏联农民的这种幸福生活，是在苏联共产党、列宁、斯大林的正确领导下，长期坚苦奋斗的结果；并且只有经过农业集体化的道路，才能有这种幸福的生活。
    这次你们在苏联受到苏联人民的极其热烈的欢迎和招待，这就是一次最生动的国际主义教育。我们知道，苏联人民在过去和现在一直是中国人民最忠实的朋友，中国革命的胜利和目前的国家建设工作，都得到苏联人民热情的、大公无私的援助，今后我们进行国家工业化和农业集体化的建设，更要依靠苏联人民的帮助。因此，加强中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，加强我们自己的国际主义教育，在目前是一个十分重要的任务。
    同志们，苏联农业集体化的道路就是中国农民将要走的道路。我们的农业生产合作社就是初步的集体化。但是毛主席指示我们：“严重的问题是教育农民”。这个十分艰巨的但是也是十分光荣的责任，首先就要落在各位代表同志的肩上，因为你们都是全国闻名的劳动模范和农业工作中的优秀干部。随着国家大规模工业建设的到来，必须在农民中进行深入具体的集体化教育。你们应该把你们在苏联亲眼看到的事实，向广大农民进行生动的宣传教育，宣传时必须结合我国的具体情况，必须结合中苏友好和国际主义，同时希望你们在宣传时要和各级中苏友好协会密切联系，把苏联先进经验深入地推广到我国广大农村的各个角落里去。
    同志们！你们过去已经有了十分丰富的农业生产经验，现在又学习了苏联的先进农业生产经验，你们是一定可以完成这个光荣任务的。我热烈地祝贺你们在祖国的生产战线上有新的成就，祝贺你们在交流中苏两国劳动农民的友谊和经验中有新的成功！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的领袖、中国人民最亲爱的导师和朋友——斯大林大元帅万岁！
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
