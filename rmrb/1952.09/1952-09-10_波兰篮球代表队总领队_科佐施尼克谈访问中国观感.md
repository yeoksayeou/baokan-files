Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 9th: The Warsaw "People's Tribune" recently published an article by Kozushnik, the leader of the Polish basketball team and Deputy Minister of Health of Poland, who had just returned from China, describing his impressions of his visit to China. He wrote: In a short period of time, the material and cultural levels of the broad masses of working people in Chinese cities and villages have been greatly improved. The rapid development of industry is also unprecedented. These achievements are inseparable from the self-sacrifice and patriotism of the Chinese people in building a new life under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, and are inseparable from the constant fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union.

Kozushnik particularly emphasized China's achievements in cultural development, writing: We witnessed the plan to eliminate illiteracy being implemented victoriously, and the Chinese people demonstrated a very high enthusiasm for learning. We were deeply impressed to see the care of the Chinese People's Government and the Communist Party for the working people and their health and cultural life.

Finally, when talking about the Chinese people's friendship with the Polish people, Kozushnik said: The unforgettable moments we spent on the court demonstrated the Chinese people's sincere friendship with Poland.

    科佐施尼克谈访问中国观感
    【新华社布拉格九日电】华沙的“人民论坛报”最近刊载了刚由中国回国的波兰篮球代表队总领队、波兰卫生部副部长科佐施尼克的一篇文章，叙述他访问中国的观感。他写道：在短短的时期内，中国城市和乡村的广大劳动人民的物质和文化水平大大提高了。工业的迅速发展也是空前的。这些成就是和在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东的领导下建设新生活的中国人民群众的自我牺牲和爱国主义精神分不开的，是和伟大的苏联的经常的兄弟般的援助分不开的。
    科佐施尼克特别强调中国在文化发展方面的成绩，他写道：我们亲眼看见消灭文盲的计划在胜利地实施中，中国人民表现了非常高的学习热情。看到中国的人民政府和共产党对劳动人民、对他们的健康和文化生活的关怀，我们十分钦佩。
    科佐施尼克最后在谈到中国人民对波兰人民的友谊时说：我们在球场上度过的令人不能忘怀的时刻，说明了中国人对波兰的由衷的友谊。
