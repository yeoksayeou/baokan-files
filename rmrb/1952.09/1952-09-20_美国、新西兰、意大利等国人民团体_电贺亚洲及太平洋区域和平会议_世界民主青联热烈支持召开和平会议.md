Xinhua News Agency, 19th: People's organizations from the United States and New Zealand have sent telegrams to the Preparatory Committee of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, wishing the conference a success.

The telegram from the Peace Committees of Alameda and Contra Costa counties in California, USA, stated: "Sincere fraternal greetings to the unity of the world in peace and friendship."

The telegram from the Asia Studies Society of the California Labor School, USA, stated: "Peace-loving Californians congratulate this historic conference and wish this great effort for peace success."

The telegram from the New Zealand-China Friendship Society of Auckland, New Zealand, stated: "Warm fraternal greetings and best wishes for the success of the conference."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th: Emilio Sereni, member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, Secretary-General of the Italian National Peace Council, Italian Member of Parliament, and former Cabinet Minister, sent a telegram on the 3rd to congratulate the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference. The text of the telegram is as follows:

The peace-loving Italian people, the seventeen million Italian people who signed the Stockholm Appeal and the Peace Pact Appeal, are watching with fervent hearts the struggle of the people of Asian and Pacific Regions for national independence and for the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

The shameful aggression against the heroic Korean people and the crimes of napalm bombing and germ warfare have aroused a strong tide of anger in our country. Peace-loving Italians have distributed 500,000 copies of Faccio's report on germ warfare, presented at the World Peace Council's Special Session in Berlin. This great movement to persuade and mobilize public opinion has played a very important role in our country's preparations for the World People's Peace Congress. Moreover, when plague General Ridgway came to inspect the American military bases in our country, millions of workers in Italian cities and rural areas protested against Ridgway's planned aggression and war policies with strikes and mass demonstrations. This means that the most acute problems to which you are devoting yourselves are also the problems raised in our struggle: We, like you, are fighting to end the wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Malaya, for national independence, against imperialist interference in our internal affairs, against the rearmament of Japan and West Germany, against weapons of mass destruction, against the arms race, and for the conclusion of a peace pact.

We are deeply convinced that your conference will give a new impetus to your struggle—which is also our struggle; this conference will be a major contribution to the cause of world peace.

This conference, with the participation of representatives of the great Chinese people who have won victory in the liberation war, representatives of the heroic Korean people, and many representatives representing the people of Asian and Pacific Regions, is a guarantee for all of us that the forces of peace will triumph over the forces of oppression, aggression, and war.

Emilio Sereni (signed)

    电贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议
    世界民主青联热烈支持召开和平会议
    【新华社十九日讯】美国和新西兰人民团体致电亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议筹备委员会，预祝会议的成功。
    美国加利福尼亚州的阿拉美达及康特拉·哥斯达两县和平委员会的贺电说：“谨对全世界在和平与友好中的团结，致兄弟般的祝贺。”
    美国加利福尼亚劳工学校亚洲学社的贺电说：“爱好和平的加利福尼亚人祝贺这个历史性的会议，祝这种争取和平的伟大努力获得成功。”
    新西兰奥克兰的新中友好协会的贺电说：“谨致热烈的、兄弟般的敬礼，并祝大会成功。”
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、意大利全国和平理事会总书记、意大利议员、前内阁部长爱弥里奥·塞伦尼，于三日致电祝贺亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，电文如下：
    拥护和平的意大利人民，曾在斯德哥尔摩宣言与和平公约宣言上签名的一千七百万意大利人民，怀着热烈的心情注视着亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为民族独立事业，为亚洲以及全世界和平事业而进行的斗争。
    对英勇的朝鲜人民发动的可耻侵略以及凝固汽油弹轰炸和细菌战的罪行，已在我们国内引起了强大的怒潮。拥护和平的意大利人已经散发了五十万份法奇在世界和平理事会柏林特别会议上发表的关于细菌战的报告，这项说服和动员舆论的伟大运动，在我们国内的准备世界人民和平大会的工作上起了极为重大的作用。而且当瘟疫将军李奇微前来视察美国在我国的军事基地时，意大利城市和农村的数百万工人都曾以罢工和群众性示威来抗议李奇微策划的侵略和战争政策。这就是说，你们所全力以赴的最尖锐的问题，也就是我们斗争中所提出的问题：我们和你们一样，也是为了结束朝鲜、越南、马来亚的战争，为了民族独立，为了反对帝国主义者干涉我国的内政，为了反对重新武装日本和西德，为了反对大规模毁灭性的武器，为了反对军备竞赛，为了签订和平公约而进行斗争。
    我们深信你们的会议将给予你们的斗争——同时也是我们的斗争——一个新的动力；这次会议对世界和平事业将是一个重大的贡献。
    这次会议有着在解放战争中取得了胜利的伟大的中国人民的代表，英勇的朝鲜人民的代表，代表着亚洲以及太平洋区域各国人民的许多代表们参加，对我们所有的人说来，是和平力量战胜压迫、侵略和战争力量的一个保证。
            爱弥里奥·塞伦尼（签名）
