Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd (TASS): American Progressive Party presidential candidate Hallinan issued a statement to the press saying that he had requested the same broadcast time as other presidential candidates to address American soldiers overseas, but the Pentagon had refused.

Hallinan wrote to US Secretary of Defense Lovett protesting the matter. Hallinan said that the Pentagon used "cost and time issues" as an excuse to deny him this right, but granted this right to Republican and Democratic candidates Eisenhower and Stevenson. Hallinan said: "Lovett is doing this to prevent soldiers risking their lives in a meaningless war from having the opportunity to hear the views of the only candidate who takes ending the Korean War as a central issue. You use 'cost' as an excuse to deny them this right, but you spend $65 billion to drop napalm bombs, level cities, and slaughter unarmed men, women, and children."

Hallinan asked: "What reason do you have to object to the armed forces knowing that there is a party that wants to save their lives? Since when did the military take over America, able to arbitrarily decide who should live, who should die, who should express opinions, and who should remain silent? We once again demand equal time to promote peace to our troops overseas."

Currently, the Progressive Party is continuing its intense election campaign under the slogan of "Peace, Jobs, Freedom" despite the various difficulties created by the American reactionaries.

    美国进步党总统候选人哈利南
    再次要求向海外美军宣传和平
    【新华社讯】据塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：美国进步党总统候选人哈利南向报界发表声明说，他曾请求与其他总统候选人一样获得同等广播时间向海外美国士兵发表演说，但已被五角大楼拒绝。
    哈利南曾就此事写信给美国国防部长罗维特表示抗议。哈利南说：五角大楼以“费用和时间问题”为藉口拒绝给他这种权利，但却把这种权利给予共和党和民主党的候选人艾森豪威尔和史蒂文森。哈利南说：“罗维特这样做是不让那些在一场无意义的战争中卖命的士兵得到机会，听取那唯一把结束朝鲜战事问题当做中心问题的候选人的意见。你以‘费用’为藉口不让他们得到这种权利，可是你花了六百五十亿美元去投掷凝固汽油弹、夷平城市、屠杀赤手空拳的男女和儿童。”
    哈利南责问道：“你有什么理由反对让武装部队知道有一个党要拯救他们的生命呢？从什么时候起军人接管了美国，能够一意孤行地决定谁该生、谁该死、谁该发表意见、谁该闭口无言呢？我们再一次要求有同等的时间来向我们海外的军队宣传和平。”
    目前，进步党正不顾美国反动派制造的种种困难，继续在“和平、就业、自由”的口号下进行紧张的竞选运动。
