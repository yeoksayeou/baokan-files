Xinhua News Agency, London, September 27th: TASS London, September 27th: Dr. Joseph Needham (British), a member of the International Scientific Commission that recently confirmed the US use of germ warfare in Korea and China, held a press conference. More than 80 reporters from British, American and foreign newspapers and news agencies attended. The reporters asked Needham mostly hostile questions, and many reporters shamelessly attempted to distort certain phrases in the Scientific Commission's report, and even tried to distort Needham's answers. However, Needham's direct, detailed, and authoritative answers powerfully demonstrated the irrefutable and absolute reliability of the evidence he presented. Everyone present, except those with the deepest prejudices, had to be convinced.

Needham first read a statement to the press. After the reporters asked a series of questions, he said: "I am convinced that the United States has carried out germ attacks against North Korea and China."

He said: The evidence presented by scientists and people from China and Korea is absolutely true.

Needham said: The Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace invited many Western scientists to participate in the investigation, and the members of the committee were only a few of them. He said: Eighteen British scientists received invitations, but only he accepted. Needham is a lecturer in the Department of Biochemistry at Cambridge University. He speaks Chinese. During the last World War, he served as a scientific advisor to the British Embassy in China and reported the Japanese germ warfare to the British government.

Needham said: "I am personally very concerned about the future of germ warfare. If infectious diseases are used to deal with humans instead of trying to eradicate these diseases, it is a fundamental destruction of moral values, which must be protested. If this situation is not stopped immediately, I am afraid that in the future we in Europe and even the whole world will encounter these things, and we ourselves will suffer."

Needham then explained the thorough methods used by the Scientific Commission in its investigation, and said: The Commission "tirelessly analyzed every incident, and as long as there was even a slight possibility, it would do everything possible to directly contact the original facts."

"The committee came to the conclusion that the people of Korea and Northeast China have indeed become the target of germ weapon attacks; the US military has used these germ weapons in many different ways, some of which appear to be developments of the methods used by the Japanese army during World War II in conducting germ warfare."

"The world must be warned by what has happened and is still happening. People of all countries must understand the potential dangers of this type of warfare and its immeasurable dangers."

Needham was surrounded by a series of questions from reporters. Someone asked about the emotions and attitudes of the four American air force prisoners of war he interrogated. He replied that these Americans knew that they were presenting this evidence now, and that they would be in a dangerous situation when they returned home in the future, but they felt so strongly that they had to expose the horrors of germ warfare that they felt they had to tell the truth. Needham said: When these Americans went to Korea, they originally regarded Koreans and Chinese as "inferior races," in fact, they viewed all Asians this way. This time, after their personal experience, they realized they were wrong.

A reporter asked why other British scientists had not accepted the invitation to go to China. Needham said they had various reasons. One famous scientist told him that he was so convinced that the Americans were conducting germ warfare that he felt it was not necessary to go to China to obtain further evidence. Another scientist employed by the government was threatened that if he went, his current position would not be guaranteed after he returned.

The bourgeois journalists—some accompanied by their medical "experts"—were still unable to defeat Needham's evidence by the end of the reception, so they tried to find fault politically. The "Daily Herald" reporter asked Needham about his political background. Needham replied: "I have been a member of the Labor Party since I was a college student." This sentence caused a burst of laughter, making the reporter embarrassed. A BBC reporter interjected: "But you once contributed to the Daily Worker," Needham retorted with "We are not in America now, so I don't intend to answer that question." As a result, there was another burst of laughter in the audience.

    李约瑟在伦敦举行记者招待会
    揭露美国在朝鲜和我国进行细菌战的罪行
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十七日讯：最近证实了美国在朝鲜和中国进行细菌战的国际科学委员会委员李约瑟（英国），举行了一个记者招待会。出席招待会者有英、美及外国各报纸和通讯社的记者八十多人。记者们向李约瑟提出的问题大多是有敌意的，有许多记者特别无耻地企图曲解科学委员会报告里的某些辞句，甚至想曲解李约瑟的答复。然而，李约瑟那些直接、详尽和权威的答复，有力地说明了他提出的证据的无懈可击和绝对可靠。在场者除了偏见最深的人之外，都不得不信服。
    李约瑟首先宣读一个向报界的声明。在记者们提出了一大串问题之后，他说：“我确信，美国对北朝鲜和中国进行了细菌攻击。”
    他说：中朝两国科学家和人民提出的证据是绝对真实的。
    李约瑟说：中国科学院和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会曾邀请许多西方科学家参加调查，委员会的委员只不过是其中很少的几个。他说：十八名英国科学家接到邀请，但是只有他一个人接受了邀请。李约瑟是剑桥大学生物化学系的讲学者。他会说中国话。上次世界大战中，他在中国当英国大使馆的科学顾问，并曾把日本进行细菌战的情形向英国政府报告。
    李约瑟说：“我个人十分忧虑细菌战的前途。要是用传染疾病的方法来对付人类，而不是设法扑灭这些疾病，那就是根本地破坏道德价值，这是必须加以抗议的。假如这种情况不立即加以制止，恐怕将来我们欧洲以至全世界都会碰到这些事情，我们自己也将身受其害。”
    李约瑟继而解释科学委员会进行调查的彻底的方法，并说：委员会“孜孜不倦地分析每一事件，只要有一点点可能，就一定想尽办法直接接触原来的事实。”
    “委员会得到下述结论：朝鲜及中国东北的人民，确已成为细菌武器的攻击目标；美国军队以许多不同的方法使用了这些细菌武器，其中有一些方法，看起来是把日军在第二次世界大战期间进行细菌战所使用的方法加以发展而成的。”
    “世界必须从已发生而现在仍然发生着的事情得到警告。各国人民必须了解这种战争方式的潜在危害性以及其难以衡量的危险”。
    李约瑟受到记者们提出的一连串问题的包围。有人问到他讯问的四个美国空军战俘的情绪和态度。他回答说：这几个美国人知道，他们现在提出了这些证据，将来回国时，境遇一定很危险，但是他们却那样强烈地觉得必须揭露细菌战的恐怖，以致他们觉得不得不把真情说出来。李约瑟说：这些美国人去朝鲜的时候，原来把朝鲜人和中国人看作“贱种”，事实上他们对全体亚洲人都是这样看的。这回，他们经过亲身的体验，才知道他们错了。
    有记者问为什么其他英国科学家没有接受邀请到中国去。李约瑟说，他们有种种不同的理由。一个著名的科学家告诉他说，他十分相信美国人正在进行细菌战，以致觉得没有必要再到中国去得到进一步的证据。另一个受政府雇用的科学家受到威胁说，假如他去的话，回来以后他的现有职位就不能保险。
    资产阶级的记者——有些有他们的医学“专家”随行——到招待会快结束的时候，还是没有能够打倒李约瑟的证据，他们因此设法在政治上找岔子。“每日先驱报”记者问李约瑟的政治背景如何？李约瑟回答说：“我从做大学生的时候起就是一个工党党员”。这句话引起了哄堂大笑，使这位记者狼狈不堪。英国广播公司的记者插嘴说：“但是有一次你向工人日报投过稿”，李约瑟回敬以“我们现在不是在美国，因此我不打算回答这个问题”。结果全堂又哄然大笑。
