Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, Ho Chi Minh, President of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued an appeal to the people to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the South Vietnamese people's resistance against French aggression on September 23rd.

    Ho Chi Minh first pointed out that the people of South Vietnam were the earliest to resist, and in difficult circumstances and far from the central government, the resistance forces in the South have grown stronger and achieved many brilliant achievements; this is due to the South Vietnamese people and troops' high love for the motherland, their unparalleled hatred for the enemy, and their unwavering belief in victory.
    Ho Chi Minh pointed out: From the end of 1950 to today, we have continuously achieved victories on the main battlefields of North Vietnam, and guerrilla warfare has expanded. These victories were also achieved with the contribution of the people of the South.
    Ho Chi Minh then pointed out: Our war of resistance will inevitably go through a long and arduous process. Our war of resistance will surely win victory, and this is also inevitable. He encouraged the Vietnamese people to work harder and unite more closely; the people, troops, and cadres should be of one heart and one mind, resolutely overcome all difficulties, give the French colonialists, American imperialist interventionists, and their puppets heavier blows, completely smash their conspiracy of "using war to support war, using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," and prepare for the conditions for a general counter-offensive.
    Finally, on behalf of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnam Workers' Party, Ho Chi Minh extended his cordial care and condolences to all the people, soldiers, and cadres in South Vietnam.

    纪念越南南部抗战七周年
    胡志明发表告人民书
    【新华社二十三日讯】据越南通讯社消息：越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席，为纪念九月二十三日越南南部人民抵抗法国侵略七周年纪念日，特发表告人民书。
    胡志明首先指出：越南南部人民抗战最早，在艰苦的环境以及远离中央的情况下，南部的抗战力量日益强大，并获得了许多辉煌的成就；这是由于越南南部人民和部队对祖国有着高度的热爱，对敌人有着无比的仇恨，对胜利有着坚定不移的信念。
    胡志明指出：从一九五零年底到今天，在北越主要战场上，我们不断获得胜利，游击战日益扩展。这些胜利也是南部人民贡献出他们的一份力量才获得的。
    胡志明接着指出：我们的抗战要经过长期的艰苦的过程，这是必然的。我们的抗战一定赢得胜利，这也是必然的。他勉励越南人民加倍地努力和更紧密地团结；人民、部队和干部同心一致，坚决克服
    一切困难，给法国殖民者、美帝国主义干涉者及其傀儡以更沉重的打击，彻底粉碎他们的“以战养战、利用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，准备转入总反攻的条件。
    胡志明最后代表越南民主共和国政府和越南劳动党，向越南南部全体人民、战士和干部致以亲切的关怀和慰问。
