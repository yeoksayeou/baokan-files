    Wang Yaowu Improves Cement Slurry Tank
    Editor: Wang Yaowu, a cement technician at the No. 4 Engineering Team of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry's Engineering Company, improved the "single-outlet cement slurry tank" on the high frame of the cement mixer to a "double-outlet cement slurry tank," increasing work efficiency by 60 percent.

    Previously, the workers in this team could mix a maximum of 150 bags of cement per day. Later, although a cement mixer was used, the mixing effect could not be fully utilized as the high frame was equipped with a single-outlet cement flow channel, and the mixed slurry could not quickly flow out of the lifting bucket. Thirty-seven workers working nine hours a day could only mix over 220 bags of cement.

    During the increase production and practice economy movement, Wang Yaowu worked hard to improve the "single-outlet cement slurry tank" into a "double-outlet cement slurry tank." The cement slurry tank now holds more slurry and discharges it faster, allowing the machine's performance to be fully utilized. Now, the workers in this team can mix more than 350 bags of cement per day, increasing work efficiency by 60 percent.　Liu Rulong

    王耀武改进水泥溶槽
    编辑同志：山西省工业厅工程公司第四工程队水泥技术工人王耀武，把水泥拌和机高车架上的“单龙口水泥溶槽”改为“双龙口水泥溶槽”，提高了工作效率百分之六十。
    从前这个队的工人，每天最多能打一百五十袋水泥。后来虽改用水泥拌和机打，但因高车架上安的是一个龙口的水泥流槽，混合浆不能很快流出吊斗，机器效能不能很好发挥。每天三十七个工人，工作九小时仅能打水泥二百二十多袋。
    在增产节约运动中，王耀武努力钻研，把“单龙口水泥溶槽”改造为“双龙口水泥溶槽”，水泥溶槽盛浆多了，出浆也快了，机器的效能全部发挥了。现在，这个队的工人每天能打水泥三百五十多袋，提高工作效率百分之六十。　刘如龙
