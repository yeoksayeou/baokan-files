    Confession of Lieutenant Floyd Brilliant O’Neill, an American Air Force Prisoner of War, Regarding Participation in American Military's Germ Warfare in Korea

    I am Floyd Brilliant O’Neill, a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, number AO—1848575. I am twenty-four years old. My home address is: Box 66, Myoe Avenue, Fairfax, South Carolina. I am unmarried, and my family consists of my mother, one sister, and four brothers. From September 1945 to June 1948, I studied at Citadel College at Charleston, South Carolina, earning a Bachelor of Science degree and completing the Reserve Officer Training Corps, where I was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. In September 1948, I became a teaching assistant in the Chemistry Department at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana, teaching chemistry experiments to first-year students and grading their papers. At the same time, I was taking courses for a Master's degree.

    In June 1950, I graduated from Tulane University with a Master of Science degree in Physical Chemistry.

    In August 1950, I was drafted into the army and chose flight training. On August 24, 1950, I reported to Randolph Air Force Base at San Antonio, Texas, where I received basic flight training until March 19, 1951. From April 3 to September 15, 1951, I received advanced flight training at Craig A.F.B. at Selma, Alabama, learning to fly the F-51 aircraft. Then I was assigned from Craig to the Gunnery School at Luke A.F.B. at Phoenix, Arizona. On December 1, 1951, at that school, I heard a secret lecture on germ warfare. On December 15, 1951, I completed my gunnery training. On January 3, 1952, I reported to Camp Stoneman, California, to await embarkation. Before leaving the United States, I received tetanus, typhoid, cholera, and smallpox vaccinations at Camp Stoneman.

    On January 10, 1952, I left Camp Stoneman, and on January 12, 1952, I arrived at Haneda A.F.B. at Tokyo, Japan, and was assigned to Foochow Area B to await further orders. On January 16, 1952, I went from Tachikawa A.F.B. to K-10 at Chinhae, Korea; this was the rear base of the 18th Fighter Bomber Group. At K-10, I was assigned to the 67th Fighter Bomber Squadron of the 18th Fighter Bomber Group. On January 19, 1952, I was sent to K-46 to be checked out for combat missions. K-46 was the forward base of the 18th Fighter Bomber Group, about five miles north of Wonju. I was assigned to "Item Flight" of the 67th Squadron and heard lectures on the various systems of the group and squadron, such as formation flying, rules of conduct, and leave system. At K-46, I made two practice flights; the first was a solo flight to familiarize myself with the area, and the second was a formation flight, fully loaded with ammunition, dropping bombs into the ocean off the east coast of Korea. I was then considered "combat ready."

    On January 22, 1952, at K-46, I heard a lecture on germ warfare. At that time, because my flight—Item Flight—was on leave in Japan, I had to wait for them to return before beginning flight missions. My first flight mission was on January 28, 1952. We were flying F-51 or Mustang aircraft. On February 15, 1952, I carried out my first and only germ warfare mission. From February 20 to 29, I contracted pneumonia and was sent to the hospital at K-10 on February 22. On March 3, I resumed flying missions. On March 4, during my thirteenth flight, I was shot down by anti-aircraft fire west of Sinmak at approximately 9:15 AM and was immediately captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers.

    I Heard a Secret Lecture on Germ Warfare at Luke Air Force Base

    The secret lecture on germ warfare at Luke Air Force Base was given to the entire student body of the Gunnery School on December 1, 1951, in the base theater. Approximately seventy students attended, including forty from the F-84 Squadron and thirty from the F-51 Squadron. The presentation began at 1500 hours, lasted about half an hour, and concluded at 1530 hours. Besides myself, the Gunnery School students present at that time, as far as I can remember, included Captain William Pohner, 1/Lt. Joe Young, 2/Lt. Frank Charette, 2/Lt. Allen Bettis, 2/Lt. John Yingling, 2/Lt. W.C. Sankey, 2/Lt. Mel Souza, 2/Lt. R.L. Michael, 2/Lt. R.S. Greyell, 2/Lt. Jack Cook, 2/Lt. John Shelander, 2/Lt. Rick Canady, and 2/Lt. Jack Shepard. At that time, these officers were all assigned to the Far East. Of these, Lieutenants Yingling, Sankey, Souza, Greyell, Michael, and Shepard were already in Korea, assigned to the 67th Fighter Bomber Squadron of the 18th Fighter Bomber Group.

    The speaker was Major Bethel W. Williams. Before his presentation, a base education officer with the rank of captain (whose name I cannot recall) introduced him. The captain said that the major had come to Luke from Washington specifically for this presentation, which was given approximately once a month to new students who had not previously heard it and who were being assigned to the Gunnery School at Luke. Major Williams was assigned to U.S. Air Force Headquarters. I believe he was under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations. The major was approximately five feet eight inches tall, appeared to be about thirty-four years old, and had a low voice. He was of average build with a slight paunch.

    The major began by telling us that the subject and content of this presentation were classified as secret intelligence. What he was about to say was not to be repeated outside the four walls of the lecture hall. He said that the purpose of the presentation was to give us some general knowledge of germ warfare so that we would have a basic understanding of the topic and would not be unfamiliar with it should we encounter it again in the future. He then began his presentation.

    He said that there were two methods of conducting germ warfare: (1) the use of germ shells by ground forces, and (2) the dropping of germ bombs by the air force, these bombs containing either bacteria or germ-carrying insects. He said that a single germ bomb dropped by the air force could disseminate far more bacteria than could many germ shells fired by ground forces. He also said that the range of shells was limited to the front lines or areas relatively close to the front lines, whereas the air force could drop germ bombs far from the front lines, deep into enemy territory. Therefore, germ shells were used to target enemy front-line troops, while germ bombs could be used against concentration points of enemy rear-echelon reserve troops and enemy towns.

    The major said that the danger to artillerymen and air force personnel from handling germ shells and bombs was minimal—virtually non-existent—unless there was an accident; for example, accidentally dropping a germ shell or bomb, allowing the bacteria or germ-carrying insects to escape and contaminate the area. He said that these germ shells and bombs were prepared and handled by special personnel specifically trained for this work. He said that antidotes had been developed for every type of bacteria, so our personnel were not at risk of contracting any diseases while conducting this type of warfare.

    The major told us that the bacteria were cultivated in special culture media in our special laboratories. Each type of bacteria requires a specific culture medium and specific temperature and humidity to grow. He told us that the insects and rodents used in germ warfare were all selected from medically well-known disease carriers, such as flies, fleas, lice, ticks, gnats, spiders, and rodents. These insects and rodents were also being cultivated in our special laboratories in Aberdeen, Maryland.

    Major Williams said that especially cold-resistant bacteria and insects had been cultivated for use in germ warfare conducted in cold climates. Bacteria are made cold-resistant through a method of "climate adaptation." The bacteria are placed in air chambers, and the temperature and humidity are gradually lowered, with small increments each time. Only after the bacteria have become accustomed to one change are the temperature and humidity lowered again. In this way, the bacteria will become accustomed to increasingly cold climates. After each change, only the strongest bacteria are kept, and then the temperature and humidity are lowered once more.

    Cold-resistant insects are obtained through cross-breeding. An insect that can carry germs is cross-bred with the same kind of insect that is cold-resistant, and then the offspring are cross-bred with the cold-resistant insect. This process of continued cross-breeding yields an insect that can both transmit disease and is adapted to cold climates.

    The major said that the research on bacteria and insects conducted for this program was extensive and expensive; however, this research had provided the U.S. military with the necessary germ weapons. He told us that most of this research was listed under so-called "special programs" and conducted by the Chemical Corps and the Army Ordnance Corps. The Army Ordnance Corps has a very large laboratory at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Most of the work at Aberdeen is done by various experts in the Army. Scientists from civilian departments also work here. In addition, leading scientists from across the country can be consulted. The Army Ordnance Corps works with the Air Force to design germ bombs. The Air Force specifies the requirements for the germ bombs, and the Army undertakes the actual design and manufacturing work.

    The major told us that the common bacteria used in germ warfare include typhoid, typhus, cholera, bubonic plague, malaria, dysentery, yellow fever, etc. These diseases are not necessarily fatal, but they are all bacteria that cause serious illness. Those contaminated with these bacteria will become very ill, and many will die unless treated immediately. If epidemics can be started among troops and the people in the rear, it will cause great damage. The infected troops will be unable to fight, and the people in the rear will be unable to work. The enemy's medical facilities will be heavily burdened, and the general situation will be dire. The major pointed out that morale will be particularly low, further weakening the enemy's forces both at the front and in the rear.

    The major had some notes in front of him, which he occasionally glanced at. This was clearly an outline to ensure that his presentation was complete and did not leave anything out, and that the content of each presentation was the same. He said that he would be traveling from Luke to Nellis A.F.B. at Las Vegas, Nevada, to give the same presentation to the Gunnery School there. He reminded us again that this report was secret and adjourned the session at 1530 hours. On the way back to the ground school in Luke, we wondered why we had to hear such a presentation, and we were all surprised by the nature of the presentation.

    Captain McLaughlin's Lecture on Germ Warfare

    On January 22, 1952, at K-46, Captain McLaughlin gave a lecture on germ warfare in the briefing room behind the group operations office. In addition to myself, the pilots who attended the lecture were: 2/Lt. Pete Nibley, 2/Lt. Jim Horseley, and 2/Lt. R.S. Greyell. As we were returning to the barracks, someone told us that Captain McLaughlin was looking for us. The four of us went to the group operations office, and Captain McLaughlin took us to a small briefing room at the rear of the building. The time was 1400 hours. McLaughlin was the group's intelligence officer. I don't know his first name; we always called him "Captain Mac." He was about five feet ten inches tall, around thirty years old, and his black hair was starting to turn gray.

    He had given this type of lecture to all the group's pilots before, but because we were new arrivals, he was giving it to us again. The room was about eight feet wide and ten feet long. There was a table and several chairs, and a blackboard on one end of the wall. He told us to relax and that we could smoke if we wanted. The captain told us that although our regular flight missions were of a "secret" nature, we could talk about them among ourselves and tell each other what we had done. However, what he was about to say was absolutely not to be mentioned to anyone, not even among ourselves. He told us that this was "top secret" and emphasized that we were not to discuss it with anyone. He said that what he was about to tell us was a new topic for us. We had to pay particularly close attention. He then began his lecture on germ warfare.

    The captain did not bring any notes, nor did he refer to anything during the lecture. He was obviously very familiar with the subject and had been trained in this area. I guessed that he had been trained at Aberdeen, Maryland. The intelligence school in Washington is very close to Aberdeen. I hadn't heard anyone talk about Captain McLaughlin's background, so I couldn't be sure where he was trained.

    He said that there were generally two types of germ bombs: (1) those that burst in the air, and (2) those with parachutes. The parachuted bombs were used to drop germ-infected insects, while the air-burst bombs were used to drop bacteria. Bacteria and insects could also be sprayed from aircraft, and various germ-carrying objects such as leaflets and pieces of paper could also be dropped. Our group was using air-burst germ bombs and spraying methods at that time.

    Captain McLaughlin said that this type of air-burst germ bomb was the same size as an ordinary five-hundred-pound bomb, but it weighed only one hundred fifty to two hundred pounds. These bombs were specifically manufactured for this purpose. They were filled with a gelatinous substance in which bacteria were growing. The bombs contained enough explosives to scatter the gelatinous substance, but not so much that the explosives would kill the bacteria. These bombs were equipped with fuses that detonated in the air or with time-delay fuses that caused the bomb to explode fifty to one hundred feet above the ground. These bombs had to be dropped from an altitude of at least five thousand feet because the time-delay fuse needed that distance to function properly and detonate the bomb at the appropriate altitude.

    The captain said that the bacteria that could be loaded into the germ bombs were: typhus, typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and plague. This type of air-burst bomb did not carry insects because the insects risked being killed by the explosion. Even if the time-delay fuse failed to function and the bomb exploded on the ground, it would still detonate upon impact. The casing of the germ bomb was thinner than that of a regular bomb, making it easier to shatter when the explosive detonated. The germ bombs were delivered and installed by special forces from the ordnance department. At K-46, the germ bombs were stored in underground concrete bunkers surrounded by barbed wire, located in the bomb loading area. The germ bombs were loaded onto the aircraft by special forces from the ordnance department.

    The captain told us that if the engine failed en route to the target, if we were south of the bombing line, or in friendly territory, we should drop the germ bomb in a deserted, uninhabited area. We should circle over the drop site and have the radar station record the exact location of the drop. Later, the radar station could tell us the exact location of the drop, and we would immediately report it to the group operations office so that personnel could be sent to remove the bomb and prevent our troops from being endangered. When dropping the bomb, we should not activate the fuse (normally, if the pilot wanted the bomb to explode, he would activate two switches in the cockpit to trigger the fuse). If we were north of the bombing line or in enemy territory, we should activate the fuse before dropping the bomb. If the drop location was not the intended target, we should report the drop location.

    The captain said that when we dropped germ bombs, we had to aim carefully to ensure that we hit the target accurately and avoid wasting them. He said that germ bombs were expensive, so we had to minimize waste. We should drop the germ bombs on cities or areas with large concentrations of troops, and the closer the bombs fell to humans, the greater their effectiveness. In this way, the bacteria could contaminate food and water, and they could also be spread on people and their clothing. The captain said that when we boarded the plane to carry out a germ warfare mission, we should not have any doubts and should carry it out as if it were a normal mission.

    Captain McLaughlin then briefly explained the parachuted germ bombs and how they worked. These bombs did not drop bacteria, but rather germ-carrying insects. The bomb had a mechanism that would release the insects upon impact. The parachuted germ bombs did not have fuses or explosives. If the bomb contained only one type of insect, the method of releasing the germ-carrying insects was for the bomb to split in half upon impact. The parachute would detach simultaneously to prevent it from covering the insects and preventing them from escaping. When the bomb made contact, a button on top would activate a small motor that would open the latches, causing the bomb to split in half. The motor would also pull out the pins securing the parachute, allowing the parachute to drift away in the wind.

    If a germ-carrying insect bomb contained more than one type of insect, it could be divided into several compartments inside the bomb using cardboard. When the bomb made contact, a small door would open on each compartment to release the insects. When the bomb made contact, the button would activate the motor, which would open the doors to release the insects; at the same time, it would release the pins on the parachute, allowing the parachute to drift freely. At this point, we took a ten-minute break and drank Coca-Cola.

    The captain then explained the device for spraying bacteria or insects. The spraying equipment was installed in the tail of the aircraft. The fuselage fuel tank behind the pilot's seat had to be removed, and a container holding bacteria or germ-carrying insects was installed in its place. This turned the aircraft into a special aircraft specifically for spraying bacteria. Special personnel would pour the bacteria or insect containers into the spraying aircraft's container.

    The captain continued, saying that to spray, the pilot would push the control lever in the cockpit, which would open the container holding the insects or bacteria, open the door leading to the spray pipe, and push the safety cover upwards to allow the insects or bacteria to be sprayed from the spray pipe. When spraying insects, a nozzle at the end of the pipe had to be removed because the insects could not escape through the small holes in the nozzle.

    The bacteria were transported in tin cans, while the insect cans had wire mesh or cloth on both ends to allow the insects to breathe. The safety cover at the end of the spray pipe was closed by a control lever in the cockpit so that any bacteria or insects left in the spray pipe would not escape when the aircraft landed. After landing, the pilot would taxi the aircraft to a special location, where special personnel would disinfect the aircraft. The pilot would immediately change clothes and shower. His clothes would also be disinfected. After the aircraft performing a spraying mission landed, a truck equipped with a sprayer would follow behind the aircraft, spraying disinfectant on the ground it had traveled over to ensure the safety of the base.

    The captain continued, saying that the germ-carrying gelatinous substance was too thick to be sprayed directly and had to be diluted with water and other solvents. Aircraft spraying bacteria or germ-carrying insects were limited to fighter aircraft because fighter aircraft had the greatest maneuverability at low altitudes. The spraying altitude was five hundred to one thousand feet above the ground. The flying speed when spraying bacteria was 350 miles per hour, and the flying speed when spraying germ-carrying insects was 200 miles per hour. F-51s, F-80s, and F-86s could all be used to spray bacteria or germ-carrying insects. If the engine failed, the pilot should land the aircraft at the nearest friendly airfield. If the engine failed anywhere else, the pilot should parachute out and allow the aircraft to crash and burn, and the flames would destroy the insects or bacteria. This type of mission was generally carried out by two aircraft, flying abreast of each other, about two hundred yards apart. The spraying was conducted over cities or military garrison areas.

    The captain told us that our group had four aircraft equipped with spraying equipment for bacteria or germ-carrying insects. These aircraft were parked at the north end of the parking apron, isolated from the rest of the aircraft. The spraying equipment on each aircraft was maintained by a mechanic and a special ground crew member trained in germ warfare. In addition to these four people, there were other special personnel from the ordnance department responsible for handling and loading the germ bombs and bacteria containers.

    Aircraft being prepared with germ bombs were parked on a special apron for loading. The germ bombs were loaded by special personnel at night or in the early morning. Spraying aircraft also taxied to this location to have the bacteria loaded into the spraying containers. A crane was used to help load the bacteria containers onto the spraying aircraft. Ordinary ammunition personnel helped load the germ bombs onto the aircraft.

    The captain said that the germ bombs and bacteria containers were flown in from Japan, approximately every two weeks. Large supplies were not kept on hand; they were only flown in when needed. The germ bombs were transported from Japan on transport aircraft such as C-46s, C-47s, and C-54s.

    Air-burst germ bombs could be dropped from B-26s, B-29s, F-51s, F-80s, F-84s, or F-86s, while B-26s and B-29s were best suited for dropping parachuted germ bombs.

    The captain spoke briefly about the cultivation of bacteria, saying that it was a troublesome process requiring constant care. They needed special conditions to grow and had to be cultivated in a culture medium, making it very expensive.

    The captain warned us again that this was extremely secret information and that we were not to discuss any part of it, not even among ourselves. He was very serious when he said this, making us aware of the gravity of the matter.

    The lecture lasted two hours, from 1400 to 1600 hours, with a ten-minute break at 1500 hours. Due to its secrecy, the lecture was held in the briefing room. The briefing room was small and could only accommodate a few people at a time. The briefing room could accommodate sixty people, but people were always coming and going, making it impossible to maintain secrecy. There were only ten of us who were new to the group, so the briefing room was large enough to accommodate all of us. Captain McLaughlin used chalk to draw seven diagrams of germ bombs and spraying equipment on the small blackboard to illustrate his presentation, and he pointed out each part as he talked about it. He had obviously given the lecture many times and was very familiar with the content, so he didn't need to refer to any notes. He had undoubtedly given the same lecture to every new pilot.

    After the lecture, we left the room and returned to our tents without saying a word, each one of us thinking about the lecture we had just heard. I wondered why we were using such terrible weapons when peace talks were underway and the war was at a standstill. We sat down in the tent and looked at each other for a few minutes. Then I suggested playing cards to divert our minds from the topic we had just heard to a more pleasant one.

    I Participated in a Mission to Drop Germ Bombs

    On February 15, 1952, the 67th Squadron assigned "Item Flight" to carry out the first mission of the day. Lieutenant Frank Harvey was the flight leader for this mission, and he selected Lieutenant Chose Podgett, 2/Lt R.S. Greyell, and myself to accompany him on the mission. We went to receive instructions early in the morning, at approximately 5:30 AM. Germ warfare was not mentioned during the regular mission briefing. About twenty pilots were present at the briefing, representing the squadron. Some were assigned to cut railroads, others to cut supply lines, etc. Commander Clark asked who from "Topkik" (the 67th Squadron's call sign) would be carrying out the first mission. When "Item Flight" was assigned, he said it was "Flak Suppressor." Then he proceeded to assign other missions, giving special instructions. We all synchronized our watches at this time. Next, we listened to Lieutenant Scott's weather briefing, followed by Captain McLaughlin's situation briefing.

    At 5:45 AM, after the briefing was completed, Captain McLaughlin called "Item Flight to get the photos." We went to the front of the room, and he led us to the small briefing room where he had lectured us on germ warfare a few days earlier. He handed Lieutenant Harvey an aerial photograph of Sibyon-Ni and said, "You will be carrying germ bombs and will drop them on the west side of the town, then fly directly back to K-46. I'll wait for you to return and report. When you report, refer to these bombs as air-burst time bombs. Remember, when you go out to board the aircraft, don't act strangely, and remember that this is top secret."

    We went to the 67th Squadron's operations room, placed the photograph there, and went to eat breakfast. We did not talk about the mission we were about to carry out. After breakfast, we returned to the squadron operations room and planned the flight, such as route, altitude, and speed. McLaughlin had told us that our takeoff time was 8:00 AM; the regular first flight was always at 7:00 AM. We put on our parachutes and walked towards the aircraft. Our four aircraft were parked next to the loading platform. We checked to see if everything was in order and the germ bombs had been loaded onto the wings by special personnel dispatched from ordnance. I only checked that the leads in the germ bomb fuse were in the proper position, then I boarded the aircraft.

    We took off and ascended along the route, climbing to an altitude of nine thousand feet, traveling at a speed of 250 miles per hour. We flew to a point approximately ten miles west of Sibyon-Ni, then turned east towards the town. As we approached Sibyon-Ni, Lieutenant Harvey signaled (without radio signal) by quickly diving and rising the aircraft several times, ordering us to fly in a single file formation. Then he began the dive bombing. We started the dive from nine thousand feet, dropped the germ bombs at seven thousand feet, then climbed back up to seven thousand feet at a speed of 350 miles per hour until we reached an altitude of seven thousand feet, and then flew back to K-46 at a speed of 250 miles per hour. We took off at 8:00 AM, dropped the germ bombs at 8:50 AM, and landed at 9:30 AM. When we dropped the germ bombs, we pressed two buttons in the cockpit to activate the fuse, then pressed a button on the control stick to drop the germ bombs. We each dropped two germ bombs on Sibyon-Ni, for a total of eight. We did not know what kind of bacteria were loaded inside the germ bombs; we only knew that they were all germ bombs.

    After landing, we parked the aircraft on the runway, went to the squadron operations room, put away our parachutes and flight helmets, then walked across the street to the intelligence office. Captain McLaughlin was waiting for us there; he said, "Tell me!" Meaning that he was going to hear our report. After a normal mission, any intelligence officer could hear our report. He led us to the small briefing room where we had previously received the photos and special instructions. I saw the germ bombs dropped by the first three aircraft fall. The flight leader saw the germ bombs I dropped explode. We therefore reported that eight time bombs exploded over the target. The report form used by the captain appeared to be the same as the regular format, and the questions he asked were the usual ones, such as, anti-aircraft fire encountered, weather over the target, any malfunctions, any faults, any enemy aircraft seen, pilot names, aircraft numbers, etc. The true nature of the mission was not mentioned. We reported that the flight had successfully suppressed the anti-aircraft fire. Our report began at 9:40 AM and ended at 9:45 AM.

    That day, I was flying aircraft number 055, in the fourth position. Harvey led the flight, Greyell was second, and Padgett was third. When the germ bombs exploded, there was a gray mist or smoke, at least as we saw it from above. The sound of the explosion would not have been loud to the people on the ground, not as loud as the explosion of a regular bomb. All the germ bombs were dropped west of the town of Sibyon-Ni.

    Our Group's Activities in Germ Warfare Missions

    Judging from their actions at our base, I believe that every pilot in the 18th Group had carried out a germ warfare mission. Newer pilots like myself had only carried out a few such missions, while the older pilots, those who had been in the group the longest, had carried out more missions. Lieutenants Harvey and Padgett seemed accustomed to these missions, while Greyell and I both felt nervous and fearful while carrying out our first such missions. I could see that others who arrived in Korea at the same time as I did—2/Lts. John W. Yingling, Mel Souza, W.C. Sankey, Pete Nibley, and Jim Horsley—showed signs of nervousness after carrying out several germ warfare missions. I noticed their nervousness, but I did not question them or tease them. I also adhered to the secrecy surrounding germ warfare.

    From their expressions and attitudes, I could tell that Lieutenants Harvey and Padgett had each carried out five germ warfare missions. As far as I know, Lieutenant Greyell had only carried out one. Lieutenants J.B. Armstrong and M. Satenstein had each carried out three missions, while Lieutenants Jim Horsley and Pete Nibley had carried out two. They seemed to have become accustomed to carrying germ bombs.

    I only know of one pilot, Lieutenant C.O. Armstrong, who had sprayed bacteria. He was the flight leader of H Flight in the 67th Squadron. Around February 18, I saw a spraying truck drive onto the runway and spray the ground behind an aircraft. This was the only time I saw this happen. I don't remember if this was on the same day that Lieutenant C.O. Armstrong sprayed bacteria. As I taxied for takeoff, I saw four bacteria-spraying aircraft parked at the north end of the airport.

    The 18th Group included the 2nd South African Air Force Squadron, the 12th Fighter Bomber Squadron, the 39th Fighter Bomber Squadron, and the 67th Fighter Bomber Squadron. The group clearly had an operational plan for dropping germ bombs in January 1952 because there was a definite procedure in place when I arrived in the group. As far as I can tell, I believe that this plan must have taken at least a month to plan, prepare, and train for. This means that the 18th Group must have been dropping germ bombs since at least mid-December 1951, or even earlier. Judging from all indications, the U.S. military decided to conduct germ warfare in Korea as early as the fall of 1951. This would have provided several months to transport the necessary personnel and equipment to the war zone and establish the plans and procedures for conducting germ warfare.

    Our Group's Morale During Germ Warfare Missions

    The group's morale was lowered by the germ warfare missions because I knew that every pilot was unwilling to carry out these missions. Before carrying out regular missions, the pilots were talkative and liked to go to the aircraft. After completing the mission, they also liked to talk about the flight, etc. However, after carrying out germ warfare missions, they said as little as possible. The pilots would say where they had gone on the mission, but they wouldn't automatically discuss the details as they usually did, such as the anti-aircraft fire encountered, the number of bombs dropped, etc. When the topic of the day's mission came up, those who had been assigned to carry out germ warfare missions would remain silent. Only if they slipped up in a normal conversation or were alone with a close friend would they talk about these missions. If germ warfare missions were mentioned in a normal conversation, everyone would fall silent for a few seconds, then quickly change the subject.

    I remember one time, after carrying out a germ warfare mission, going to the hospital to see Lieutenant R.L. Michael, who was staying there. He asked me what I was doing. He guessed from my expression and answers that I had carried out a germ warfare mission. He said, "In a way, I'm glad I'm here (in the hospital) and not with you guys carrying out flight missions." He had only flown two or three times before being injured in a takeoff accident. I knew that he was a man of strong religious convictions, so I knew that he was not eager to leave the hospital because he might have to carry out germ warfare flight missions after being discharged. I told him that I didn't feel happy about everything, and he said that he could sympathize with me.

    After carrying out germ warfare missions, the pilots who had participated in the flight appeared depressed and unhappy all day long and always drowned their sorrows at the club. The topic of conversation when they drank was always the sad state of the U.S. government. I remember that on the evening of February 15, after carrying out a germ warfare mission, the topic of conversation among Lieutenants Harvey and Padgett, 2/Lt. Greyell, and myself was that we would love to see Truman flying a Mustang aircraft over Korea. The thought made us laugh, so we immediately called Truman another "George Two." "George Two" was the nickname we secretly used for Group Commander Colonel Levinson because he had once flown with George Flight (G Flight) as the number two wingman. When he reached the target, he panicked and dropped his bombs randomly. The flight leader told the number two wingman to lead the flight back to base, but Colonel Levinson, who was flying the number two aircraft, replied that he could no longer figure out his exact location. This incident caused a lot of ridicule behind the colonel's back. The not-so-complimentary nickname "George Two" was forever attached to him. At the club, the four of us occupied a table because the other pilots had apparently decided to let us work through the impact that the germ warfare mission had had on us. This had become a habit because we all respected the feelings of those who wanted to avoid talking about germ warfare or who didn't want people to mention their recent participation in germ warfare.

    One night in mid-February, an incident occurred at the officers' club. At a table near Lieutenant C.O. Armstrong's, someone asked him what he had done that day. Because he had already had several drinks, he loudly replied, "I didn't spray any bacteria today, that's for sure." 67th Squadron Commander Lieutenant Colonel Crow was sitting at our table. He immediately stood up, walked over to Armstrong, and took him outside. He talked to him for about fifteen minutes, and then Armstrong left the club and returned to his tent. After the incident, the people in the club fell silent for a moment. Then someone called out, "More beer," and the conversation resumed, but everyone was very careful about what they said.

    I don't know how the soldiers reacted to germ warfare because I had very little contact with them. The ground crew chief was always very talkative when you boarded the aircraft. Normally, the ground crew chief would say something friendly to the pilot, such as, "Please bring this aircraft back; we don't have many," and other similar things. But on the morning of February 15, he only said "Good morning" to me.

    Having to watch what you say made most of the pilots feel stressed because, in normal times, discussing everything was very casual and straightforward, with the exception of germ warfare, of course. Germ warfare missions definitely lowered the morale of the pilots and the entire personnel.

    My Conscience Tells Me to Speak Out

    We know that the aircraft performing germ warfare missions in Northeast China are F-80s, F-84s, and F-86s. They are usually active in the area between the Chong-Chong River and the Yalu River. These aircraft are fast and maneuverable, making it easy for them to fly to Northeast China from bases in South Korea. These types of aircraft are faster than the F-51, so the chances of survival are greater if they encounter MiG jets. If MiG aircraft appear and threaten the F-80s and F-84s, the F-86s fly above to provide cover.

    I believe that the U.S. military chose to begin germ warfare in

    美国空军战俘奥尼尔中尉参加在朝美军所进行的细菌战之供词
    我是弗洛依德·白利兰特·奥尼尔，是美国空军后备队的一个中尉，番号AO—1848575。现年二十四岁。家庭通讯处是：南卡罗来纳州、费尔法克斯城，莫耶路六十六号信箱（Box 66,Myoe Avenue,Fairfax,South Carolina）。我尚未结婚，家中只有我的母亲，一个姊妹，和四个兄弟。自一九四五年九月至一九四八年六月，我在南卡罗来纳州查理士登城的契塔特尔大学（Citadel College at Charle-ston,South Carolina）念书，获得理学士学位，并经过后备军官训练队， 被任命为少尉。一九四八年九月，我到路易斯安那州新奥尔良城的土仑大学（Tulane University in New Orleans,Louisiana）当化学系助教，指导一年级学生的化学实验工作，评阅他们的卷子。同时，也读硕士学位的课程。
    在一九五○年六月，我自土仑大学毕业，获得物理化学硕士学位。
    在一九五○年八月，我被召入伍，选择了飞行训练。在一九五○年八月二十四日，我往得克萨斯州圣安多尼的兰多尔夫空军基地（Randolph Air For-ce Base at San Antonio,Texas）报到，一直到一九五一年三月十九日，我在那儿受驾驶基本训练。自一九五一年四月三日至九月十五日，我在亚拉巴马州西尔马城的克莱格空军基地（Craig A.F.B.at Selma,Alabama），受到驾驶高级训练，学习驾驶F—51型飞机。然后我由克莱格被派往亚利桑那州费匿克斯城的卢克空军基地（Luke A.F.B. atPhoenix,Arizona）的射击学校。在一九五一年十二月一日，在那个学校，我听了一次细菌战的秘密演讲。在一九五一年十二月十五日，我学完了射击训练。一九五二年一月三日，往加利福尼亚州的史东曼兵营（Camp.Stoneman,California）报到，在那里候船出国。在离开美国以前我在史东曼兵营打了破伤风、伤寒、霍乱、及天花的预防针。
    一九五二年一月十日，我离开史东曼兵营，一九五二年一月十二日，到达日本东京羽田空军基地（Haneda.A.F.B. at Tokyo,Japan）被派至府中基地（Foochow Area B）听候调遣。一九五二年一月十六日，我自立川空军基地（Tachikawa A.F.B.）到朝鲜镇海的K—10基地（K—10 at Chinhae,Korea）；这是第十八战斗轰炸机大队（18 th Figh-ter Bomber Group）的后方基地。在K—10基地，我被派至第十八战斗轰炸机大队的第六十七战斗轰炸机中队。在一九五二年一月十九日，我被送至K—46基地，受战斗任务的检验。K—46基地是第十八战斗轰炸大队的前线基地，在原州以北面约五哩处。我被派在第六十七中队的“爱顿”小队（Item Flight），听到了关于大队和中队各种制度的讲演，如编队形式，应遵守的纪律，以及休假制度。在K—46基地，我举行二次练习飞行；第一次是单独飞行，以熟习该地区，第二次是编队飞行，满载了军火，把炸弹投入朝鲜东海岸的海洋中。我于是被认为“可以作战”了。
    一九五二年一月二十二日，在K—46基地，我听了一次细菌战的讲演。在那时，因为我的小队—爱顿小队—正在日本休假，所以我得等他们返来，才开始飞行任务。我的第一次飞行任务，是在一九五二年一月二十八日。我们驾驶的是F—51型或野马式飞机。在一九五二年二月十五日，我执行了第一次也是唯一的一次细菌战任务。一九五二年二月二十日到二十九日，我得了肺炎，二月二十二日被送到K—10基地的医院。三月三日，我重行开始执行飞行任务。三月四日，在我第十三次飞行时，在新幕西面被高射炮火击落，时间约九时十五分，立即被中国人民志愿军所俘获。
    我在卢克空军基地我听了一次细菌战的秘密演讲
    在卢克空军基地的细菌战的秘密演讲，是于一九五一年十二月一日在基地戏院对射击学校全体学生讲的。大概有七十个学生出席，其中四十人从F—84中队来的，三十人从F—51中队来的。报告在十五时开始，讲了约半小时，于十五时三十分结束。除了我自己外，当时出席的射击学校的学生，据我所记忆的，有威廉·甫南上尉（Captain WilliamPohner），舟·扬中尉（1/Lt.Joe Young），弗来克·却立脱少尉（2/Lt. FranK Charette），爱伦·贝的司少尉（2/Lt.Allen Bettis），约翰·英林少尉（2/Lt.John Yingling），W.C. 桑开少尉（2/Lt. W.C. Sankey），曼尔·苏萨少尉（2/Lt.Mel Souza），R.L. 米契尔少尉（2/Lt.R.L. Michael），R.S. 格雷也尔少尉（2/Lt.R.S. Greyell），杰克·库克少尉（2/Lt.Jack Cook），约翰·施兰特少尉（2/Lt. John Shelander），立克·开纳地少尉（2/Lt.Rick Canady）和杰克·施百特少尉（2/Lt.Jack Shepard）。在那时，这些军官都被派到远东，其中英林少尉，桑开少尉，苏萨少尉，格雷也尔少尉，米契尔少尉和施百特少尉已在朝鲜了，都派在第十八战斗轰炸大队的第六十七战斗轰炸机中队。
    演讲者是培特尔·W·威廉士（Bethel W.Will-iams）少校。在他演讲以前，有一个上尉衔的基地教育军官（他的名字我现在记不起来介绍他）。上尉说，这个少校由华盛顿来卢克是专为这次演讲来的，这种演讲，大约每月一次，讲给被派到卢克的射击学校的，从前尚未听见这个演讲的新学生听。威廉士少校是被派在美国空军总部。我想他是作战副参谋长（Deputy Chief of Staff for Opera-tions）的属下。这位少校约五呎八吋高，看起来大约有三十四岁，语调低沉。普通身材，肚子微挺。
    少校开始时向我们说，这次演讲的题目和内容都是属于秘密情报。他所讲的，绝不能传出讲堂四壁之外。他说，这次演讲的目的，是给我们介绍一些细菌战的普通知识，使得我们对这题目可有一点基础，如果将来再遇到这个题目时，不致感到陌生。然后他便开始其演讲。
    他说，进行细菌战的方法有两种：（1）由地面部队使用细菌炮弹，（2）由空军投掷细菌炸弹，这些细菌弹中可装细菌或带菌的昆虫。他说，空军用一枚细菌弹所投的细菌，远比地面部队用许多细菌炮弹所撒布的细菌为多。他又说，炮弹的射程，限于前线或比较接近前线的地方，空军却能把细菌弹投于远离前线的地点，深入敌人后方。因此，细菌炮弹是用于对付敌方前线部队，而细菌弹则可用以对付敌人后方后备部队的集中地点和敌人城镇。
    少校说，携带细菌炮弹和炸弹对炮手和空军人员的危险很少，——实际上可说没有，除非是发生意外；例如意外地把细菌炮弹或细菌炸弹掉下来，使细菌或带菌的昆虫得以逸出，污染了这一地区。他说，这些细菌炮弹和细菌炸弹是由受过这项工作的专门训练的特别人员准备和处理的。他说，对每种细菌都已制有抗毒素，因此，我方的人员进行这种战争，没有沾染任何疾病的危险。
    少校告诉我们说，细菌是在我们的特别实验室培养基培育的。每一种细菌，需要一定的培养基，特定的温度和湿度，才能生长。他告诉我们说，用于细菌战的昆虫和啮齿动物，都是选自医学上所稔知的疾病传播者，如苍蝇、跳蚤、虱子、扁虱、蚋蚊、蜘蛛和鼠类。这些昆虫和啮齿动物，在马里兰州、亚伯丁（Aberdeen, Maryland）我们的特殊实验室中也培养着。
    威廉士少校说，特别耐寒的细菌和昆虫，已经培养出来，可用在寒冷气候下进行的细菌战。细菌系用“气候适应”的方法，使之耐寒。把细菌置于空气箱中，逐渐将温度和湿度降低，每次下降的数量很小，俟细菌习惯于这次变化之后，才再将温度和湿度降低。这样，细菌就会习惯于愈来愈冷的气候。在每次变化之后，只留下最强壮的细菌，然后再一次降低温度和湿度。
    耐寒的昆虫，系用杂交的方法得到。将一种能带病菌的昆虫与一种能耐寒的同样的昆虫交配，再将其后代与耐寒的昆虫交配，这样继续杂交下去，就可得到一种昆虫，能具有传染疾病的性能，又习惯于寒冷的气候。
    少校说，为这种计划而进行的细菌和昆虫的研究，规模浩大，也很费钱；可是，这种研究已使美国军队得到所需的细菌武器。他告诉我们说，这种研究大部分是列入所谓“特殊计划”，由化学兵团及陆军军械处进行。陆军军械处在马里兰州亚伯丁试射
    （Proving Ground）有极大的实验室。亚伯丁所有的工作，大部是由陆军各种专家做的。文官部门中的科学工作者，也在此地工作。此外，可向全国的第一流科学家征询意见。陆军军械处与空军共同设计细菌弹，空军提出细菌弹的规格条件，陆军从事细菌弹的实际的设计和制造工作。
    少校告诉了我们，用于细菌战的普通的细菌有伤寒、斑疹伤寒、霍乱、腺鼠疫、疟疾、痢疾、黄热病等。这些疾病并不一定是致死，但都是招致严重疾病的细菌。沾染这些细菌的会病得很利害，除非即时医疗，许多人就会死亡。如果能在军队中和后方人民中引起流行病，就会招致很大损害。这些沾染了病的军队，就不能战斗，而后方人民就不能工作。敌人的医疗设备将负担很重，而一般的情形将很恶劣。少校指出，士气都将特别低落，因此更削弱了敌人前方和后方的力量。
    少校有一些笔记放在他面前，有时看一下。这显然是一个提纲，使他的演讲包括全部而没有遗漏，并使他每次演讲的内容都一样。他说，他将从卢克到尼瓦达州拉斯佛加斯城的尼尔斯空军基地（Nellis
    A.F.B.at Las Vegas Nevada），向那里的射击学校演讲。他再一次提醒我们，这个报告是秘密的，在十五时三十分宣布下课。在返回卢克城地面学校的路中，我们奇怪为什么我们要听这样的演讲，我们对演讲的性质都感觉诧异。
    麦克拉夫林上尉的细菌战演讲
    在K—46基地，一九五二年一月二十二日，麦克拉夫林上尉在大队作战处后面的汇报室演讲细菌战。听讲的驾驶员除我以外，有：彼特·尼百来少尉（2/Lt.Pete Nibley），杰姆·何尔司利少尉 （2/Lt,Jim Horseley），和R.S.格雷也尔少尉
    （2/Lt.R.S. Greyell）。当我们返回营房时，有人告诉我们说，麦克拉夫林上尉在找我们。我们四人即到大队作战处，麦克拉夫林上尉带我们到该建筑后部的一间小汇报室，这时是十四时零分。麦克拉夫林是大队的情报军官。我不知他的名，我们常称他为“麦克上尉”。他大概五呎十吋高，年在三十岁左右，黑色的头发已开始变灰了。
    这样的演讲，他从前已向大队的所有的驾驶员讲过了，因为我们是新到者，所以再讲给我们听。这房间大概有八呎阔十呎长。有一张桌子和几把椅子，在室之一端的墙上，有一块黑板。他告诉我们不要拘束，要吸烟可以吸烟。上尉告诉我们说，我们通常的飞行任务虽属于“秘密”性质，我们在自己人之间可以谈论，可以互相告诉各人所做的事。可是，他所要讲的东西，绝对不许向任何人提起，连在我们自己中间也不许讨论。他告我们说，这是“最机密”的，并着重说，我们不得与任何人谈论。他说，他要向我们讲的，对我们是一个新的题目。我们须特别注意倾听。他随即开始其细菌战的演讲。
    上尉没有带任何笔记，在讲时也没有参考任何东西。显然他已很熟悉这个问题，已受过这方面的训练。我猜想，他是在马里兰州的亚伯丁受训练的。华盛顿的情报学校离亚伯丁很近。我没有听见人谈论过麦克拉夫林上尉的履历，所以不能肯定他是在哪里受训练的。
    他说，细菌弹普通有二种：（1）一种是在空中爆裂，（2）一种是带降落伞。带降落伞的，乃用以投掷染有细菌的昆虫，而空中爆裂的，乃用以投掷细菌。从飞机也能喷射细菌和昆虫，也能投掷各种带菌的物体如传单、纸片等。我们大队在那时是使用空中爆裂式的细菌弹和喷射的方式。
    麦克拉夫林上尉说，这种空中爆裂的细菌弹，与普通五百磅炸弹大小相同，但其重量只有一百五十至二百磅。这种炸弹是特为此一目的而制造的。它们里面装着胶状物质，其中有细菌生长着。这种炸弹装有足够的炸药，以撒布胶状物；可是炸药又不能太多，因为炸药太多就会把细菌杀死。这种炸弹装有在空中爆裂的信管或定时爆炸的信管，使炸弹在离地五十至一百呎的空中爆炸。这种炸弹，必须在离地五千呎以上的上空投掷，因为定时信管要有这样距离，方能起适当作用，使炸弹在适当高度的空中爆炸。
    上尉说，细菌弹可装的细菌是：斑疹伤寒、伤寒、霍乱、痢疾及鼠疫。这种空中爆炸的炸弹，不装载昆虫，因为昆虫有因爆炸致死的危险。定时信管，即使信管不及时发生作用而在空中爆炸时，在碰到地面时也能爆炸。细菌弹的外壳，比平常炸弹为薄，当炸药爆发时，易于炸碎。细菌弹系由军火部门的特种部队运来和安装的。在K—46基地，细菌弹储存于装载炸弹地区旁边的，周围装有刺铁丝网的炸弹库里的地下水泥防空洞。细菌弹系由军火部门的特种部队装上飞机。
    上尉告诉我们说，如果在飞向目标的中途，引擎发生障碍，如果是在轰炸线以南，或在友区，我们应将细菌弹投掷于荒野无人居住地区。我们要在投弹地点的上空盘旋，并叫雷达站记投弹的正确地点。以后，雷达站能将投弹正确地点告诉我们，我们立即向大队作战处报告，以便派人到该地将炸弹移去，使我们的军队不致遭到危险。投弹时，不使信管发生作用（通常，如果驾驶员想让炸弹爆炸，他就安装在操纵舱内的两个电钮，使引信发生作用），如果我们是在轰炸线以北，或在敌区，我们就要使信管发生作用之后投掷，如果投弹的地区不是预定的目标，就要报告投弹的地点。
    上尉说，我们在投细菌弹时，必须尽力瞄准，使能准确击中目标，以免浪费。他说细菌弹是昂贵的，所以必须尽量减少浪费。我们应将细菌弹投于城市或大军集中的地区，炸弹扔得越靠近人类，发挥的效能就最大。这样，细菌可以污染食物及水源，也可以撒在人们的身上和衣服上。上尉说，当我们上飞机去执行细菌战任务时，不可有所怀疑，要与平时一样，若无其事地去执行。
    然后麦克拉夫林上尉简要地解释了带降落伞的细菌弹和它如何起作用。这种带降落伞的细菌弹，不是投掷细菌，而是投下带有细菌的昆虫。炸弹上装有一个机关，它能在炸弹触地时就放出昆虫。带降落伞的细菌弹是没有信管的，也没有炸药。如果弹内只装一种昆虫，放出带菌昆虫的方法，是炸弹触地时就分裂为两半。降落伞可以同时脱落，以免将昆虫盖住，跑不出来。当细菌弹触地时，顶端的电纽就发动小马达，小马达就把门闩打开，使弹分开为两半。马达也将系住降落伞的针拔出，使降落伞随风飘去。
    如果带菌昆虫弹装了不止一种昆虫时，可在弹体内用硬纸板隔成几隔。当弹触地时，各段有一小门打开，将昆虫放出。当弹触地时，电纽即开动马达，马达把门打开，放出昆虫；同时，把降落伞的针松脱，使降落伞自由飘去。讲到这里，我们休息十分钟，喝喝可口可乐。
    上尉然后解释喷射细菌或昆虫的装置，喷射的器械是装在飞机的尾部，驾驶员座后的机身汽油箱必须移开，而装上盛细菌或带菌昆虫的容器。这就变成专为喷射细菌用的特殊飞机。由特殊人员把细菌罐或昆虫罐倾入喷射飞机的容器中。
    上尉继续说，要喷射时，驾驶员将操纵舱中的操纵杆推动，操纵杆就把装昆虫或细菌的罐子开启，将通向喷射管的门打开，并把安全盖推向上方，以便把昆虫或细菌从喷射管喷出。在喷射昆虫时，在管子末端的安全盖的下面，有一喷嘴必须挪开，因为昆虫不能从喷嘴的小孔跑出来。
    细菌是装在锡罐运来的，装昆虫的锡罐则两端是铁丝网或布，以便昆虫呼吸。喷射管顶端的安全盖，由操纵舱里的操纵杆所关闭，因此，在飞机着陆时，喷射管中留下的细菌或昆虫，不会逃出。着陆之后，驾驶员就将飞机滑行到一特殊地点，由特殊人员将飞机消毒。驾驶员立刻更换衣服，洗澡。他的衣服也要消毒。执行喷射任务的飞机着陆之后，就有一辆装有喷射器的卡车随在飞机后面，用消毒水喷射飞机走过的地面，以保障基地的安全。
    上尉继续说，带菌胶状物太浓，就不能直接喷射，一定要用水和其他溶剂加以稀释。喷射细菌或带菌昆虫的飞机只限于战斗机，因为战斗机在低空的机动性最大。喷射的高度是距地面五百至一千呎。喷射细菌时的飞行速度是每小时三百五十英里，喷射带菌昆虫时的飞行速度是每小时二百英里。F—51，F—80，F—86都可以用来喷射细菌或带菌昆虫。如遇引擎发生障碍，驾驶员应使飞机在最近的友方飞机场着陆。如果引擎在任何地方失去效能，驾驶员就应跳伞，任飞机撞地燃烧，火焰会把昆虫或细菌烧毁。这种任务，一般是由两架飞机执行，两机齐头飞行，相距约二百码。喷射是在城市或军队驻区上空进行。
    上尉告诉我们说，我们的大队有四架装有喷射细菌或带菌昆虫设备的飞机，这些飞机停在停机旁道的北端，与其余的飞机隔离。每一架飞机的喷射装置，由一名机械士和一名受过细菌战训练的特殊地勤人员照顾。除了这四人之外，还有属于军械部门的其他特殊人员负责处理和装载细菌弹及细菌容器。
    准备带细菌弹的飞机，停在特殊旁道，以便装载。细菌弹是在夜间或清晨由特殊人员装载的。喷射用的飞机，也滑行到这地点，以便把细菌装入喷射容器。有一架起重机帮助将细菌容器装上喷射飞机。普通的装弹人员帮助把细菌弹装上飞机。
    上尉说，细菌弹及细菌容器系由日本空运来的，大约每两星期运来一次。大量供应不在手头，需用时才运来。细菌弹是从日本用C—46，C—47，C—54等型的运输机运来的。
    空中爆炸的细菌弹，可以用B—26，B—29，F—51，F—80，F—84，或F—86型飞机投掷，B—26及B—29则最适于投掷带降落伞的细菌弹。
    上尉简单地讲到细菌的培养，他说，培养细菌是很麻烦的，需要不断的照顾，它们需要特殊的条件，才能生长，而且要在培养基上培养，培养起来非常费钱。
    上尉又警告我们说，这是极端秘密的情报，我们不得讲其任何部分，也不得在我们自己间谈论。他说的时候很严肃，使我们认识到事情的严重性。
    演讲长达二小时，从十四时零分到十六时零分，中间在十五时零分休息了十分钟。由于它的秘密性，演讲是在汇报室举行的。汇报室很小，只能容少数人同时听讲。传令室可以容六十人，但总有人出入，不能保密，我们大队只有十个人是新来的人，传令室足够容纳我们全体新来的人，但是汇报室却只能容我们几个人。麦克拉夫林上尉为了说明他的演讲内容，用粉笔在小黑板上画了七个细菌弹和喷射机械的图形，并在讲到各部分时，把画出的各部分都指给我们看。他显然已讲了许多次，对内容已很熟，用不着笔记参考。无疑地，他对每一个新来的驾驶员都作过同样的演讲。
    演讲终了后，我们离开这间房子，回到我们的帐篷，没有人讲一句话，每个人都在想方才的演讲。我奇怪当和谈正在进行而战争又处于停顿时，为什么我们使用这种可怕的武器。我们在帐篷里坐下，面面相觑了几分钟。然后我建议玩纸牌，为的是把我们的思想从方才所听到的题目转移到一个比较愉快的题目上去。
    我参加投掷细菌弹的任务
    一九五二年二月十五日，第六十七中队派“爱顿”小队执行当天的第一次任务。弗郎克·哈维（FrankHarvey）中尉是这次飞行的领队，他挑选了却司·巴杰特（Chose Podgett）中尉、R.S.格雷也尔
    （R.S.Greyell）少尉、和我自己，随同他执行这项任务。我们在清早约五时三十分时前往听取指示，在正规的交代任务时，没有提到细菌战，同时听取命令的约二十名驾驶员，代表着中队。有的被派担任切断铁路，有的被派担任切断给养线，等等。指挥官克拉克（Clark）少校曾问谁从“Topkik”
    （第六十七中队的呼号）去执行第一次任务。当派定“爱顿小队”（Item Flight）时，他便说这是“镇压高射炮火”（Flak Suppressor）。于是他进行分派其他的任务，给予特殊的指示。我们这时全体将表校准。接着，我们听取了司考特（Scott）中尉的气象指示。然后听取麦克拉夫林上尉的情况指示。
    五点四十五分时，指示听取完毕，麦克拉夫林上尉叫“爱顿小队来拿照片”。我们走到房间的前面，他把我们领到几天前他曾向我们讲细菌战的那间小的汇报室去。他交给哈维中尉一张市边（Sibyon-Ni）的空中照相，接着说，“你们将携带细菌弹，将它们投在该镇的西面，然后直接飞回K—46基地。我等你们回来汇报，汇报时把这些炸弹称为空中爆炸的定时炸弹。记住，当你们走出去上飞机的时候，不要作出奇怪的样子，并且记住这是极端秘密的”。
    我们走到第六十七中队的作战室，把照片放在那里，就去吃早点。我们没有谈及我们即将执行的任务。早餐后，我们回到中队作战室，计划这次飞行，如路线、高度、速度等。麦克拉夫林告诉过我们说，我们的起飞时间是在八点零分，平时的第一次飞行总是在七时零分。我们带上降落伞，走向飞机。我们四架飞机就停在装卸台的旁边。我们察看到飞机是否已经一切妥善，细菌弹已经装在机翼上，这是由从军械处特派人员装上去的。我只检查了细菌弹信管中的引线是否在适当的地位，然后就跑上飞机。
    我们起飞了，按照航线上升，在途中一直上升到九千英尺的高度，速度是每小时二百五十英里。我们飞到约离市边以西十哩的地点，然后折东向该镇飞去。当我们接近市边时，哈维中尉即将飞机很快地俯冲和上升数次为信号（没有无线电信号），命令飞成单行纵队形，然后他就起始俯冲轰炸。我们从九千英尺起始俯冲，在七千呎时投下细菌弹，然后在六千呎时即以每小时三百五十哩的速度上升，直到七千呎高度时，即以每小时二百五十哩的速度，飞回K—46基地。我们在八点零分起飞，八点五十分投下细菌弹，九点三十分着陆。当我们投掷细菌弹时，我们在操纵舱里按了两个电钮，使信管发生作用，然后按操纵杆上的一个机钮，将细菌弹投下。我们在市边各投下两枚细菌弹，总共是八枚。我们不知道投下细菌弹内装的是哪种细菌，我们只知道都是细菌弹。
    着陆后，我们将飞机停在跑道上，到中队作战室把我们的降落伞和飞行帽放好，然后走过大街到情报处去。麦克拉夫林上尉在那里等着我们；他说，
    “告诉我吧！”意思是说，他将要听取我们的汇报。在执行一个正常的任务之后，任何一个情报人员都可听取我们的汇报。他领我们到听取汇报的小屋里，这就是以先我们接受照片和特殊指示的地方。我曾看见头三架飞机的细菌弹落下，领队看见我所投的细菌弹爆炸，因此，我们报告说，八枚定时炸弹在目标上空爆炸。这个上尉所用的汇报表格，看来和正规的格式一样，他所问的问题也是平常的问题，例如，遭遇到的高射炮火，目标上空的气候，有无运转失灵的地方，有无故障，看到任何敌机，驾驶员姓名，飞机号数，等等。我们这次任务的真正性质则没有提及。我们报告说，这次飞行，成功地压制了高射炮火。我们汇报在九点四十分开始，九点四十五分完毕。
    那天，我驾驶的是055号飞机，飞行第四位置。哈维领队，格雷也尔第二，巴杰特第三。当细菌弹爆炸时，便有灰色的雾或烟，至少我们从上空看起来是如此的。爆炸的声音，地面上的人听来，不会很大，不会像是一颗平常炸弹的爆炸声那么大。细菌弹全都投在市边镇以西。
    在细菌战任务中我们大队活动
    从他们在我们这个基地上的行动来判断，我相信第十八大队里的每一个驾驶员都曾执行过细菌战的任务。像我这样比较新的驾驶员只执行过几次这种任务，而老驾驶员们，即在这大队里时间最长的，则执行过较多次数。哈维和巴杰特中尉看来都已习惯于这种任务，而格雷也尔和我在执行第一次这种任务时则都觉得神经紧张而且怕惧。我看出其他和我同时到朝鲜来的人——约翰·W·英林（John W.Yingling），曼尔·苏萨（Mel Souza），W.C.桑开
    （W.C.Sankey），彼特·尼百来（Pete Nibley）和杰姆·何尔司利（Jim Horsley）诸少尉——在执行过几次细菌战任务之后，都显出神经紧张。我注意他们的神经紧张，可是没有询问他们，也没有逗弄他们。我也遵守细菌战是属于秘密性的。
    从他们的表情和态度，我可以说哈维和巴杰特中尉每人曾执行过五次细菌战任务。就我所知道的，格雷也尔少尉只执行过一次。J.B.阿姆司特朗（J.B.Armstrong）及M.萨吞司坦（M. Satenstein）少尉每人曾执行过三次，杰姆·何尔司利和彼特·尼百来少尉执行过两次。他们看来是已经习惯于携带细菌弹了。
    我只知道有一个驾驶员，C．O．阿姆司特朗（C．O．Armstrong）中尉，曾喷撒过细菌，他是第六十七中队H小队的领队。大约在二月十八日前后，我曾看见喷洒卡车开到跑道上，在一架飞机后面喷洒地面，这是我看到这种事情的唯一的一次。我不记得这是否和C．O．阿姆司特朗中尉喷撒细菌同一天的事。当我将机滑行起飞时，曾看见四架喷射细菌的飞机停在机场的北端。
    第十八大队包括第二南非空军中队，第十二战斗轰炸机中队，第三十九战斗轰炸机中队，及第六十七战斗轰炸机中队。这个大队明显在一九五二年一月已有进行投掷细菌弹的作战方针，因为当我到达这个大队的时候，便已有了确定的程序。就我所知，我以为这个方针至少要有一个月的时间来计划、准备和训练。这就是说，第十八大队一定自一九五一年十二月中旬以来，甚或更早，就已投掷细菌弹了。从一切象征来判断，美军在朝鲜进行细菌战是早在一九五一年秋天就已决定的。这样便有几个月的时间好把必需的人员和装备运到战区，并建立起进行细菌战的方针和程序。
    我们大队在执行细菌战任务时的士气
    大队的士气因细菌战的任务，而变得低落了，因为我深知每一个驾驶员都不愿意执行细菌战任务。驾驶员们在执行正规任务前，都是爱说话的，喜欢到飞机旁边去，任务完毕后，也爱谈论飞行经过，等等。但是，在执行细菌战任务之后，却越少说话越好。驾驶员们会说他们曾到什么地方执行任务，但是不像平时那样会自动谈论详细的内容，例如，遭遇的高射炮火，投掷炸弹的数目，等等，当开始谈到当天的任务时，被派执行细菌战任务的人们就默不作声，只有在通常谈话中说滑了嘴，或是和一个知友单独在一起时，才会谈起这些任务。假若在通常谈话中谈到细菌战任务，大家在几秒钟之内都会默不作声，然后很快把话题转移到别处去了。
    我记得有一次在执行细菌战任务之后，即去医院看住在那里的R．L．米契尔（R．L．Michael）少尉。他问我在做什么，他从我的表情和回答，就猜出我执行过细菌战任务。他说，“在某方面说来，我高兴我住在这里（医院）而没有和你们在一起执行飞行任务。”在他因起飞失事而受伤以前，他只飞过两三次。我知道他是个有强烈的宗教感情的人，因此我知道他并不渴望出院，因为出院后或许就要执行细菌战的飞行任务。我告诉他说，我并非对每件事都感觉愉快，他说他能够同情我。
    在执行细菌战任务之后，那些参与飞行的驾驶员们，整天都显得抑郁不快，并且总在俱乐部借酒解愁。他们喝酒时的谈话题目，总是美国政府现在所处的可悲的地位。我记得在二月十五日的晚间，执行了细菌战任务之后，哈维中尉、巴杰特中尉、格雷也尔少尉和我四个人的谈话题目，是我们很愿意看到杜鲁门驾着一架野马式机在朝鲜的上空飞。这个想法使人发噱，于是我们立即称杜鲁门为另一个“乔治第二”（George Two）。“乔治第二”这个外号，是我们背地里称呼大队长利文森（Levinson）上校的。因为有一次他曾和乔治小队（George Flight）即G小队飞行，驾驶第二号僚机。到了目标上空，他慌张了，把炸弹胡乱扔掉。当时小队长叫第二号僚机把这小队带回基地，但是利文森上校，就是驾驶第二号机的，回答说他已弄不清楚他的准确的位置了。这件事，在上校背后，引起了不少的嘲笑。“乔治第二”这个并非称赞的绰号，就永远给他戴上了。在俱乐部内，我们四个人占有一棹，因为其他驾驶员显然是决定让我们自己挨过细菌战任务所给予我们的影响。这已经是一种习惯，因为我们全都尊重那些想要避免谈细菌战或是不愿人提起他们最近参加细菌战的人们的感情。
    二月中旬，有一天晚上，在军官俱乐部发生了一件事。在C．O．阿姆司特朗中尉邻桌，有一人问他那天干了什么，他因为已经喝了好几杯酒，他就大声的回答说：“我今天没有喷射细菌，那是肯定的。”六十七中队长格鲁（Crow）中校坐在我们桌上，他立刻站了起来，走过去把阿姆司特朗中尉带到外面去，和他谈了大约十五分钟，阿姆司特朗中尉就离俱乐部，回到他的帐篷里去。事情发生后，俱乐部中的人们顿时静默了一会，然后有人叫“再来些啤酒”，谈话才又恢复，不过每人对自己的谈话都非常小心。
    我不知道士兵们对细菌战的反应如何，因为我和他们接触很少。地勤队长在你跑上飞机的时候，他平常总是很爱说话的，平常地勤队长会和善地向驾驶员说，“请把这架飞机飞回来，我们飞机可不多，”以及其他类似的话。但是在二月十五日的早晨，他只对我说了声“早安”。
    言谈要留意，这就使大部分驾驶员感得紧张，因为在平常的时候，讨论一切问题都很随便和很直爽，当然细菌战是例外。细菌战任务确把驾驶员及全体人员的士气降低。
    我的良心要我把话说出来
    我们知道在中国东北执行细菌战任务的飞机是F-80，F-84和F-86。他们普通是在清川江（Chong-Chong）和鸭绿江之间的地区活动。这种飞机的速度大，且很灵活，能够很容易地从南朝鲜的基地飞到中国东北地区。这几种飞机的速度，比F-51大，所以一旦遭遇米格式喷气机时，生还的机会也大些。如米格式飞机出现并威胁及F-80及F-84时，F-86型就飞在上面掩护。
    我认为，美军选择冬季开始进行细菌战，显然是要以朝鲜作试验细菌战的场所，试验我们在特殊试验室中制出的耐寒细菌武器。最终的目的，是要在对气候寒冷的国家如苏联及人民民主国家进行细菌战时，使用这些细菌武器。
    根据这些事实，我作证说，美军在朝鲜进行细菌战迄今已有半年以上。这是当和谈尚在进行的时候使用的。参加这种惨无人道的战争，向无辜的平民投掷细菌弹，这对驾驶员是一件很困难干的事。可是他没有选择余地，只得遵照命令。甚至向北朝鲜人民和中国人民志愿军投这种可怕的武器，驾驶员的感觉也是如此。进行细菌战是违反一切人道原则，全世界爱好和平的人民都反对。美国的人民必须讲话，谴责那些决定使用这种惨无人道的武器的人。在更多的无辜人民被这种可怕的武器杀害之前，每
    一个人都应尽自己的一份力量，立即制止细菌战。世界上一切有正义感的人们，尤其是美国人，必须毫不踌躇地起来反对这种惨无人道的细菌战争！

    站在一个美国公民的立场，我看不出对北朝鲜和中国东北的人民使用细菌战武器有任何正当理由。没有必要对于这些国家的和平居民使用这种可怕的大量屠杀的武器。这种武器是摧残人类文明的最不人道的武器——是日内瓦公约特别禁用的武器。美国算是遵守这个公约的，或者至少他遵守过一个时期。连纳粹法西斯也不敢使用这种可怕的武器，但是现在美军却放肆地公开地使用着。美国公民之斥责细菌战，主要理由之一，就是害怕报复，因为没有一个美国人愿意看到美国遭受使用细菌武器的军队的攻击。
    美国人民所选出的政府高级人员，并不服从人民的愿望，因为人民并没有授权他们进行细菌战。美国人民与全世界爱好和平的人民一样，反对细菌战。当美国人民知道了一切的事实时，他们会谴责帝国主义者，并以服从人民愿望的更好的领袖来替换他们。
    美国军队的成员，不得不拨开他们对这类事情的个人感情而执行司令官给他们的命令。这个看法，已经深深的灌注于我们的作战部队里，以致习惯于对命令不起怀疑，先执行命令，然后想它。为了进行细菌战，必须有这种纪律制度。这种盲目的服从，才使人接受命令去做他们个人痛恨的事，但是纪律性已成为如此强烈，以致他们只知执行命令而不去想及其后果。在空军中，还有一个因素，就是一切都隔离得很远——细菌弹着陆地点，是在几千英尺以下，飞机航员们永远看不见他们投下的炸弹所造成的后果。可是，如果一个人具有正义感，他就不能不对他所做的事加以思索。做为一个曾经参加细菌战的人，我可以说，回想及自己在这种细菌战争中的行动，就感觉极不愉快。飞在目标上空，按动机钮，以投掷炸弹，这只需要训练——并不需要思想。如果能训练猴子，它们也会做这件事与人类做的一样。这些猴子是不会想的！我并没有主张细菌战——我不愿意参加。但是命令来了，我与其他驾驶员所做的完全一样。我服从命令，并且设法不去想我所做的是什么，不去想我带给在我下面几千英尺的无辜人民的是何等可怕的破坏。我丝毫不能为我的行动辩护，因为那是不可能的。认识我在这种战争中有一份儿，——使我内心不安。我不能了解为什么决定在朝鲜进行细菌战——更不用说中国了。那些下决定的人们，必须承受这个决定所将带给他们的后果。而我们中间执行了他们的决定的，必须认识我们在这个摧毁文明的战争是有一份儿的！
    细菌战如何来的？在文明的世界里谁完成了这样可怕的武器？我认为爵恩柴斯·新顿（Joan ChaseHinton）描写这些人是“关在实验室里的疯子，想出新法子来毁灭世界！”是很恰当的。科学应该是为人类的利益而不是为毁灭人类；科学应该尽全力来寻求治疗疾病的方法，而不应在发明新的疾病和散布这些疾病的方法。有些研究科学的人们，现在正把思想集中于使用科学进行破坏，他们是撇弃了科学的精神。一个医生决不愿意把他所有的病人都杀死——相反地，他应尽其所能以救治他们。为什么有些科学家却试图杀死他们的病人呢？只要这些科学家们把他们的努力转向着和平的研究，就可以医治世界人民的穷困和痛苦。
    那些正在为细菌战而工作的美国科学家们，很清楚他们是在做什么！他们已经忘记或者有意地忘记了崇高的理想，这崇高的理想鼓励每一个人都尽力为人类服务。这些人沾辱科学！他们没有使科学成为人类的奴仆，自己反而成了奴仆。这些人的工作的后果是可怕的。他们应该记住，只要他们拒绝做这种工作，他们就能防止人民所遭受的许多痛苦。这些科学家并不是军人！没有人命令他们做这种工作。然而，他们做了这种工作，而且他们以所得的结果而自豪。他们的光荣是不会长久的。那些在实验室中做研究或生产工作的美国科学家是不会被遗忘的，因为这些美国人在工作中用他们的手决定了全世界人民的命运。
    怎样才能制止细菌战？美国人能与一切国家的爱好和平的人联合起来要求停止这种惨无人道的战争。如果所有的人民团结一致，他们的呼声就会被听见！只要他们说出来，就会被听见。政府不能忽视所有的人民；因为人民团结起来，就比任何种政府都更有力量。
    进行细菌战是对世界和平的最大的损害。进行细菌战是危及我们的文明。这种战争是违背一切人道主义的原则。一切国家的爱好和平的人民都谴责这种战争以及下令进行这种战争的人们。
    总而言之，我以一个美国公民和美国空军人员的立场斥责细菌战。我被命令参加细菌战，我参加了这种战争，但是没有人能命令我说这种战争是必要的或认为这种战争是必要的，因为并没有必要。为什么对朝鲜和中国的无辜人民使用这种惨无人道的武器？不论想出任何藉口来，这种战争是没有必要的。这些细菌武器是对付人民的，然而我与朝鲜和中国的人民却没有任何争执。细菌战可以制止，而且必须制止。科学家必须离开破坏工作，而转向有利人类的和平的生产的工作，并且把科学变为造福人类的工具。美国人民必须与别国的爱好和平的人民携起手来，并撤换那些企图为这种战争武器辩护的官员。只有这样，才能消除这个对人类和对文明的严重威胁。
    然而，美军在朝鲜和中国东北仍在进行细菌战。这个可怕的战争还在进行，继续杀害更多的无辜的人民。这细菌战必须被制止。美国人民必须认识这些可怕的武器的严重性，一致起来制止细菌战。到那时全人类才有和平！

    给在南朝鲜的第十八战斗轰炸机大队的驾驶员的一封公开信
    虽然这封信是写给第十八战斗轰炸机大队的驾驶员的，但其内容也适用于在朝鲜飞行的每一个美国空军人员。
    第十八大队里有些人会记得我的名字。你们甚至还许记得我是于三月四日在北朝鲜被击落。在我的名字后面写着在执行任务时失踪，这是不大正确的。我没有失踪——我还很好地活着！我因飞机损毁而降落，只是我的生命的新的一章的开始。我还可以说，那是我生命史上最重要的一章。
    你们大概都会同意，你们全是善良的。现在我问你们：你们是否快乐？你们把细菌弹扔在朝鲜人身上，很高兴吗？你们的心，是否允许你们这样做而仍然觉得自在呢？我想不会，我知道我执行细菌战任务的记忆，在我心中燃烧着。我不能忘记它。我不相信你们任何人是那么黑心肠，竟能忘记它，或是耸耸肩，认为它是战时的必要，就算了事。你们之中，有谁喜欢眼看你们的祖国被细菌战蹂躏呢？我们没有人会要有这样的事。那么，我们为甚么又做这样的事呢？决不是为了一百块美金的飞行费。你们愿意为每月一百元而在这个黑暗的祭坛前出卖你们的灵魂吗？不要忘记，我的朋友们，在下次发薪的日子，并不是你们全体都会在场拿钱的。
    你们有些人不明白我为什么写这封信。我来告诉你们吧。我必须写这封公开信，因为我的良心叫我写。我的正义感使我不得不说话。我现在写这封信，因为现在正是高呼制止这种在世界散布传染病的疯狂行为的时机了。我自被俘以来，中国人民志愿军对我只是优待。我知道了我们的军队所做的可怕的事情，并且亲眼看见了被炸得精光的城镇和村庄。连我们自己的战俘营都不安全。现在，有些驾驶员，我不知是谁，曾在战俘营投掷细菌弹。难道这是对待你们本国人的办法吗？我向人性呼吁，我相信人人生下来就有人性的。
    制止这种野蛮的屠杀，并且现在就制止它！不要再让一个炸弹掷落在朝鲜国土上。任何一个白痴的人都能学会飞行和扔炸弹。但是你们是人，是有一个能思想的头脑和一颗能指导你们行动的灵魂。当你们投掷细菌弹时，是这颗灵魂在指导你们吗？抑或你们是被那些告诉你们说细菌战是一个“人道的”屠杀方法的人的虚伪的话所指导呢？不管你们怎么看这个问题，答案都是相同——细菌战是已知道的战争中最卑下的、最野蛮的、和最惨无人道的战争。
    在细菌战中，主要的受害者是朝鲜和中国东北的无辜人民。这些人民并没有要战争。他们痛恨战争。这个称为“警察行动”的疯狂行动，把他们日常生活全都改变。然而你们，穿着你们的整齐的
    “警察”制服，正在杀着伤着这些没有加害过你们的无辜的人。难道这是散布善意的方法吗？
    你们能做甚么？你们说，你们只是依照命令行事吗？现在听吧。停下来想一想吧。并且对你自己公平。你们每个人，一直到最后排的末一个人，应该立即停止细菌战飞行。有一件事是肯定的（并且是数学的事实）：没有驾驶员进行细菌战飞行就等于没有细菌战飞行。还有一句话，他们不能把全队都受军事审判。大声说吧，诸位，让人听见你们的声音！团结起来，一致行动，你们不投掷细菌弹，
    “将为全世界所闻”。
    你们会说，我是一个战俘，在北朝鲜的安全地带坐着看戏。我告诉你们吧，你们投掷的细菌弹，对战俘毫不客气。我在看的“戏”是怪讨厌的，令人不快的。到了清算的时候，就没有地方藏躲了。每
    一个参加细菌战的人，必须认识他的责任。难道你不知道吹笛的人是在吹着死亡的调子吗？难道你们跟着这个调子跳舞，已跳得晕眩，丧失了理智吗？
    你们这样看吧。你们是愿意回家的。我也愿意回家。我们都愿意在和平的世界中生活着。答案就在这里。第一步，停止细菌战！这一件事，就是我们问题的全部解决的关键。然后，和平解决朝鲜战争。不是很简单吗？是的，很简单。并且很容易做——如果你们肯采取必需的步骤的话。最后解决是全取决于你们。你们是否将对人类做这么巨大的贡献吗？只有时间能够证明。想一想吧，一个没有轰炸、没有细菌武器致人死亡的世界。这个回答还不清楚吗？选定正路，并且坚决。你们这样做，不只有利你们自己，而且也帮助了我和全人类。目的并不能为手段辩护。为你们的国家的前途着想，大声疾呼吧。“现在是时候了，就是你们！”
    我只能要求你们，请求你们，恳求你们采取纠正的行动。我只能用语言来斗争。我已从第十八战斗轰炸大队被转到第一和平战斗大队。我关切地期待你们行动起来，尽你们的一份力量，使这场“戏”很好收场。
    让我们更换吹笛人的调子吧，让我们跟着和平的调子跳舞吧。和平的调子将是何等灿烂、和谐呀！现在不是胆怯的时候。讲吧！行动吧！你们的为和平的努力将受到尊崇。
    我向你们之中和我认识的人致意——并且请你们把这一目标牢记心里。
    忠实的，
