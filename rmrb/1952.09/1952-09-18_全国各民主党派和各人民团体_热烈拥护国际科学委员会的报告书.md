Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: National democratic parties issued written statements and gave talks, warmly endorsing the report of the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," and calling on the people of the whole country and the people of the world to unite and jointly stop the shameless crime of bacteriological warfare by American imperialism.

The statement of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated: The crime of the American aggressors in conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China, since the investigation and exposure by the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and world-renowned figures, the vast majority of people around the world have been convinced that this is an indisputable fact. The inhumane American aggressors, attempting to escape the condemnation of justice, used the excuse that the investigators were not scientists, attempting to deny the bloody crime of massacring peaceful people in Korea and Northeast China. Now, the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," composed of world-famous scientists, after more than two months of hard investigation and research, has completely proved that the American aggressors did indeed conduct bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The previous pitiful excuse of the American aggressors has been completely shattered. The members of the International Scientific Commission issued a solemn call to the people of the world to "stop the inventions of science from being used to destroy mankind." We fully support it, and we are confident that as long as the people of the world unite closely, we will be able to stop the disasters imposed on mankind by the aggressors. Let us, under the call of the International Scientific Commission, immediately take effective action to resolutely sanction the towering crimes of the enemies of mankind.

The spokesperson of the headquarters of the China Democratic League said in a written statement: This serious work of the International Scientific Commission has made a great contribution and has a noble value to mankind. After this heinous crime of the American aggressors is completely exposed and confirmed, they will surely tremble in the face of this ironclad fact.

Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said in a written statement: The publication of the report of the International Scientific Commission will enable the people of the world to further recognize that the American aggressors, in pursuit of their goal of dominating the world, have long become inhuman cannibals who commit all kinds of evil. We resolutely and unanimously support the call of the International Scientific Commission, and we are determined to fight to the end, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, together with the people of the world, to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, to stop the American bacteriological warfare crime, and to safeguard lasting peace in Asia and the Pacific region!

Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said in a written statement: We, the Chinese people and the people of the world, love peace and love science. I believe that the American people also love peace and love science. There are also many true scientists in the United States. I believe they will understand everything after reading the report of the International Scientific Commission. Scientists serving the truth around the world, unite! Stop the American aggressors from carrying out bacteriological warfare.

Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said in a written statement: We express our heartfelt gratitude and supreme respect to the scientists of the International Scientific Commission for their contribution to human peace and their scientific attitude of fighting for truth and justice. We firmly believe that this sentiment is shared by the people of the world. The people of the world will respond to the call of the International Scientific Commission to save peace, save mankind, and save science with greater determination.

The statement of the China Zhi Gong Party stated: We resolutely support the solemn report of the International Scientific Commission. We call on all peace-loving people in the world to unite to oppose the disgusting bacteriological warfare crimes committed by American imperialism and its accomplices, and at the same time, to fight to the end for the realization of peace in Korea and the world.

The statement of the Jiusan Society stated: From the actual investigation and careful study of many personal and material evidences, international scientists have confirmed that the methods used by the American invading army to conduct bacteriological warfare are inherited from the methods used by Japanese imperialism during World War II to conduct bacteriological warfare, and have been developed. On the eve of the convening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference, the publication of this historical document has its own particularly important significance. It points out to us a serious task, namely, that the struggle against and stopping the crime of American bacteriological warfare, severely punishing American and Japanese bacteriological war criminals, and defending the peace of Asia and the Pacific Regions are inseparable.

The statement of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League stated: The Chinese and Korean people have defeated the Japanese fascist bandits who used bacteriological weapons, and today they are also firmly convinced that they will be able to defeat the American aggressors who use bacteriological weapons. The Chinese people will unite more closely with the people of the world and continue to support the Chinese and Korean People's Armies, and fight tirelessly for saving peace, saving mankind, and saving science!

The written statement of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League stated: In order to save world peace and to defend the security of the motherland, we, the Chinese youth, fully support the solemn call of the International Scientific Commission. The Chinese youth, together with the Chinese people, will unite more closely with the people of the world and resolutely stop the crime of American bacteriological warfare.

Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: After the publication of the report of the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China, major national people's organizations issued statements one after another, warmly endorsing this report and unanimously expressing their response to the call of the commission to fight to stop the war and save peace.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement saying: The American aggressors, who are accustomed to shameless denials, have repeatedly denied that they have used bacteriological weapons. However, facts speak louder than words. This time, the "International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China," composed of famous scientists from six countries, with an objective scientific attitude, after more than two months of serious and careful investigation and research, further fully proved scientifically that the American army did indeed commit the crime of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, on behalf of the working class of the whole country, expresses its warm support for the just and selfless report of the International Scientific Commission, and expresses its heartfelt gratitude to them for successfully completing this serious work in order to save peace, save mankind, and save world civilization. We also once again issue a serious warning to the American aggressors: Shameless denials and sophistry cannot cover up the ironclad facts. The American aggressors must immediately stop the bacteriological warfare being carried out in Korea and Northeast China, otherwise they will surely reap the bitter fruit of their own making!

The statement of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation pointed out: This report once again confirmed to the people of the world the fact that the American aggressors killed peaceful residents and innocent women and children of China and Korea, and further deepened the hatred of our women and mothers for the inhumane American aggressors. The statement called on women all over the world, regardless of political, religious, racial, or skin color differences, to unite more widely for the safety of every family and the happiness of children, to stop the war and defend peace.

The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth and the All-China Students' Federation said in a joint statement: Despite the American aggressors' all kinds of sophistry, the facts of their heinous crime of bacteriological warfare are all there, and they are trying to cover up their guilt. We, the youth and students of China, will unite more closely with the people of China and the people of the world to stop the crime of American bacteriological warfare.

The statement of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs stated: "We firmly believe that all people in the world who love justice and peace and have a little conscience will never allow this heinous crime of the American aggressors to continue. As long as the people of the world unite and work hard, they will surely be able to defeat the frantic provocations of American imperialism and defend lasting world peace!"

The statement of the China People's Relief Association stated: We are humanitarian relief and welfare workers, we love peace, love truth, hate aggression, and hate bacteriological warfare. We call on relief and welfare workers across the country and all people in the world who seek welfare for mankind to stand up immediately and fight to stop the war and eliminate human disasters!

The statement of the Red Cross Society of China condemned the despicable means of the American representatives at the 18th International Red Cross Conference to obstruct our delegation from publishing documents on bacteriological warfare. The statement appealed to more than 100 million Red Cross members worldwide: We must face up to the towering crime of American imperialists' large-scale massacre of human beings, and act in unison to impose effective sanctions on American imperialists.

The statement of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, after making the demand to "prohibit bacteriological warfare and sanction bacteriological war criminals, and force the US government to abide by the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare," emphatically pointed out: "Our Chinese industrial and commercial circles deeply wish to further strengthen the unity among countries in the Pacific region and the people of the world, restore and develop normal trade relations between countries, and promote friendly cooperation between the people of all countries, so as to safeguard world peace."

The spokesperson of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles pointed out in a speech: The towering crimes of the American aggressors have been irrefutably proven, and there is no room for sophistry. We, on behalf of Chinese literary and art workers, pay high tribute to the great work achievements and selfless spirit of all members of the International Scientific Commission, and fully support the call of the International Scientific Commission.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association praised the work achievements of the International Scientific Commission in a statement saying: "People will not forget the model of upright scientists they have established in this investigation." The statement also stated: As long as the people of the world unite more closely in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the great Soviet Union and supported by the unity of the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union, they will surely be able to thwart the crazy provocations of the American aggressors and defend lasting world peace.

The statement of the Preparatory Committee of the China Political Science and Law Society pointed out that the report of the International Scientific Commission "is an extremely important document," and the statement said: "Our national legal workers will be with democratic legal workers all over the world and all peace-loving people, and use the weapon of people's law and all other forces to fight to stop American aggression and save human peace!"
