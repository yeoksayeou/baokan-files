The Benxi Engineering Company's civil engineering team has an advanced plastering group, the Ninth Plastering Group at the vertical shaft construction site. While studying Yang Dezhong's new plastering method, they created five new tools, increasing plastering efficiency from 7.3 meters per person per day to 32.75 meters, with all work meeting quality standards.

However, just a month ago, the Ninth Group was the worst group in the plastering team. They lacked unity, didn't work enthusiastically, often failed to complete tasks on time, and their plastering efficiency was often only 4.5 meters. Many people's wages were below the basic wage.

Where did the Ninth Group's tremendous change begin?

On May 30th, a decorated veteran, Sun Taikuan, came to their group. Originally a plasterer, he joined the revolution in 1937 and received a long period of Party education. He was injured in the head by a shell during the liberation of Changsha, and only gradually recovered after a long period of treatment. Although his body was weak, his thinking was very sound. He said, "Although I shed blood many times during the Liberation War, I cannot be lazy in economic construction. I want to contribute my share and strive to realize a communist society as soon as possible."

He joined the group just as the leadership called for a universal campaign to subscribe to increase production and practice economy plans and wanted to mobilize group discussions. Everywhere else was in full swing, but his group was not moving at all. The reason was that the workers in the group had complex thoughts and lacked unity. Group member Lu Baoxian was lazy at work, "defecating" several times a day, and reluctant to come out of the toilet once he was in there. Wang Zongshun loved to fool around, sitting on the scaffolding playing the harmonica to amuse people while plastering. There were also some who liked to be stubborn, complain, and disobey the site leaders. The group leader, Sun Qingxin, also had shortcomings in his leadership, either completely ignoring his workmates or getting angry and putting on airs. The engineering team sent people to help them, but those people didn't understand the workers' thinking and just kept holding meetings, solving nothing, making the workers more and more confused. Sun Taikuan was secretly anxious, thinking, "The task of increasing production and practicing economy is a serious political task. What if it can't be completed!" At this time, he helped the group leader improve his leadership and gave everyone political lessons and talked to individual workers to conduct class education and cultivate activists. Initially, he came up with a simple method to mobilize workers to contribute work and submit plans for increasing production and practicing economy. The workers responded, but the leadership didn't allow this simple method of intensifying labor, but wanted them to find tricks. But where were the tricks? How to tap potential? He was worried.

"Worrying alone doesn't solve the problem. You have to find a solution." Sun Taikuan decided to take the lead in finding a solution, subscribing to a *Northeast Daily* and a *Worker's Daily*, reading the newspapers late into the night every day to find advanced experiences. He was constantly thinking about the group's potential strengths during the day, his brain never idle. One day, he saw Yang Dezhong's new plastering method in the *Northeast Daily*. He associated it with the group's situation of having few skilled workers and many apprentices. Using the old method, apprentices couldn't get involved in a large amount of work, while learning Yang Dezhong's new plastering method would solve this problem and increase production. But after his experiment, Yang Dezhong's large plastering board, although efficient, had the drawback of leaking gray on both sides. He thought about changing the large plastering board, but also thought, "How can you change something created by a model worker at will!" After repeated consideration, he decided that in order to improve efficiency and ensure quality, he must improve the plastering tool. Every day after work, he would climb on the table to draw diagrams, drawing for three nights, with a large pile of drawings, before the drawings were considered complete.

He excitedly took the drawings to the site leaders, wanting to request a piece of scrap board for experimentation, but the site leaders didn't support him. He went home and split his only old pot lid, begging the carpenter across the street, Sui, to nail it according to the drawings. But the wood was decayed and cracked with every nail. He walked home and, coincidentally, his wife had just finished cutting vegetables and put down the cutting board. He picked up the cutting board and went to Sui the carpenter to make a new plastering tool according to his design. He took it to the site for testing, but there were many problems. Some people in the group mocked him sarcastically, saying, "What is this thing, not like a dustpan, not like a dipper." Even more embarrassing was that someone secretly smashed the new tool twice in a row.

Sun Taikuan thought, "For the smooth progress of work, I can't experiment on the construction site anymore." At night, he nailed the broken tool back together at home, mixed some mud himself, and tried it on his own wall. After nine modifications, it was finally successful. He put down the tool, pounded his sore back, and then slowly undressed and went to sleep, but excitement kept him awake all night.

The next day, he took the new tool to the group to demonstrate, and this time it plastered quickly and well. Everyone said, "This time it will work." One person said, "It works, but doing this is more tiring than using a small trowel." But another person immediately retorted, "Don't talk nonsense, a small trowel takes four or five hours of work, this thing only takes an hour to finish. Which one is more tiring?" From then on, no more voices of opposition were heard. The only problem now was that iron sheeting was needed on the bottom for the gray to flow more smoothly. Sun Taikuan wrote a report and took the masses' request to get iron sheeting. He found the squad leader, who pushed it to the platoon leader. He found the platoon leader, who pushed it to the company commander. He found the company commander, who said, "Leave it here, we'll consider it!" The consideration lasted for five days, and the approval came back as "disapproved." Sun Taikuan then used his own money to buy iron sheeting to put on. Soon, the entire group automatically used this dustpan-style new plastering tool. Due to the change of tools, what used to be only 7.3 meters plastered per person per day can now plaster 32.345 meters (gross calculation), and the quality is completely up to standard. However, the leaders still didn't pay attention and transferred them from the "South Site" to the "Vertical Shaft."

Once at the "Vertical Shaft," the situation changed. The leaders of the vertical shaft construction site valued his creation, the grass-roots trade union chairman Li Shuyuan actively supported his creation, and the Party branch secretary also encouraged him to continue to move forward. All the workers in the group were praised. At this time, Sun Taikuan was truly happy beyond words. He then created a trowel for smoothing flat whitewash and a large flat square that can be used for three purposes (relying on flatness, scraping flat, and smoothing flat).

Now, finding "tricks" has become the norm in their group, and everyone wants to find tricks in their own work process; even the "mixing ash" and "digging spoon" people are no exception. The lazy Lu Baoxian became a supporter of advanced tools and worked very honestly, with 100% attendance; Wang Zongshun, who loved to fool around, and those who used to satirize and attack Sun Taikuan, also examined their mistakes. In the past, they hated Sun Taikuan's political lectures, but now they unanimously elected Sun Taikuan as their political instructor, giving political lessons twice a week. The Ninth Group's achievements in increasing production and practicing economy are rising in a straight line. Their August plan for increasing production and practicing economy increased by more than 18 percent compared to July. Due to the increase in labor efficiency, wage income has also increased. In July, the third and fourth class technicians of the Ninth Group reached a monthly income of 700 to 800 points, and ordinary workers could also get 200 to 300 points a month. Sun Taikuan said:

"Our group's plan for increasing production and practicing economy will be higher month by month in the future, and every worker has this confidence." Yes, they will definitely continue to increase production, because they have the strong guarantee of advanced thought, and the whole group can unite and help each other and create boldly.

    先进思想的胜利

    本溪工程公司土建队，有一个先进的抹灰小组，这就是竖井工地瓦工第九小组。他们在学习杨德重的新抹灰法时，创造了五种新工具，抹灰效率每人每日由开始的七公尺三，达到三十二点七五公尺，质量也都合格。
    但是，在一个月前，第九小组还是瓦工队最坏的一个组。他们不团结，工作不起劲，经常不能按时完成任务，抹灰效率常常只能达到四点五公尺，许多人的工资低于基本工资数。
    第九小组的巨大变化，是从那里开始的呢？
    五月三十日，他们组里来了一个荣誉军人——孙太宽。他原是瓦工出身，一九三七年参加革命，长期受着党的教育。在解放长沙的战役中，被炮弹炸伤了脑袋，经过长期治疗，才逐渐恢复常态。虽然他的身体很软弱，但是思想很健康。他说：“解放战争中我虽然流过多次血，经济建设中我还不能偷懒，我要有一分热发一分光，努力争取早一天实现共产主义社会。”
    他去到这个小组，正赶上上级号召普遍订增产节约计划，要发动小组讨论。别处搞得热火朝天，而他这个组，一动也不动，原因是组里工人思想复杂，不团结。组员卢宝贤工作偷懒，一天“大便”好几次，进厕所就不爱出来；王宗顺专爱打闹，抹灰时坐在架子上吹口琴逗人玩；还有些爱抬死杠、发牢骚，不服从工地的领导人。组长孙清欣的领导也有缺点，对工友不是干脆不管，就是发脾气，耍态度。工程队曾派人来帮助他们，那些人也不掌握工人思想情况，只一个劲开会，啥问题也不解决，工人越弄越糊涂。孙太宽暗中着急，他想：“增产节约任务是严重的政治任务，完不成怎么是好呢！”这时，他一面帮助组长改进领导，一面给大家讲政治课和找个别工人谈话，进行阶级教育，培养积极分子。最初，他想出一个简单的办法，发动工人献工，交增产节约任务，工人们响应了，但上级不允许这种单纯加强劳动强度的办法，要他们找窍门。可是窍门在那里？潜力怎么挖？他可愁住了。
    “光愁不解决问题，要想办法。”孙太宽决定带头想办法，自己订了一份东北日报和一份工人报，每天夜晚看报到深夜，找先进经验；白天琢磨组里的潜在力量，脑子总不闲着。一天在东北日报上看到杨德重的新抹灰法，他联想到组里技工少徒工多的情况，用旧法干，大量的活件徒工插不上手，而学习杨德重的新抹灰法，解决了这一问题，就可提高生产。但经过他的试验，杨德重的大抹灰板，效率虽是高，可是两旁好漏灰，是个缺点。他想改变一下大抹灰板，又想到：“人家劳动模范创造出来的东西，那能随便改！”反覆思考后，他还是决定为了提高效率、保证质量，一定要改进抹灰器。每天下班回家，就爬在桌子上画图样，画了三个夜晚，图纸卷了一大堆，图样才算画好。
    他兴奋地拿着图纸去找工地领导干部，想请求一块废板皮做试验，可是工地领导干部却不赞助他。他回家把自己仅有的一块旧锅盖劈了，央求对门隋木匠给他照图样镶钉，那知木质腐朽，一钉都裂了。他走回家去，恰巧他老婆刚切完菜，放下菜板，他就拿起菜板去找隋木匠，按照他的设计作成了一个新的抹灰器。他拿到工地去试验，可是问题挺多。组里有些人在一旁冷嘲热讽地取笑他：“这算是啥玩艺，簸箕不像簸箕，斗不像斗。”更难堪的是有人一连两次偷着把新工具给砸碎了。
    孙太宽想：“为了工作的顺利，不能再在工地试验了。”夜晚他在家把砸碎的工具再钉起来，自己和点泥，就在自己的墙上试。经过九次修改，最后成功了。他放下工具，捶捶累酸了的腰杆，这才慢慢地解衣就睡，可是兴奋使他一夜未睡着。
    第二天他拿新工具到组里去表演，这回抹的又快又好，大家都说：“这回能行。”有一个人说：“行是行，干这玩艺比小抹子累。”但另一个人马上反驳他说：“别扯，小抹子干四、五个钟头的活，这玩艺只干一个钟头就完，看究竟是那个累？”从此，再也听不见反对的声音了。现在的问题，只是还需要在底上铺上洋铁皮，灰才淌得更顺溜。孙太宽写了报告，带着群众的要求去领洋铁皮。找班长，班长推到中队长；找中队长，中队长又推到大队长；找大队长，大队长说：“先放在这儿，考虑考虑！”一考虑就是五天，批下来还是“不准”。孙太宽又自己拿钱买洋铁皮铺上。很快的，全组也都自动使用这个簸箕式的新抹灰器了。由于改变了工具，过去每人每日只能抹七点三公尺，现在能抹三十二点三四五公尺（毛算），质量也完全合格。但是，领导干部仍然不重视，并把他们从“南地”调到“竖井”去了。
    一到“竖井”，情况就变了。竖井工地的领导干部重视了他的创造，基层工会主席李树元积极支持他的创造，党支部书记也勉励他继续前进，全组工人也都受到了表扬。这时孙太宽真有说不出的高兴，他又接二连三地创造了抹平面白灰的抹子，和一使三用（靠平、刮平、抹平）的大平靠尺。
    现在，找“窍门”成了他们组里的风气，每个人都想在自己的工序上找出窍门；连“和灰”“挖勺”的人都不例外。偷懒的卢宝贤成了先进工具的拥护者，干活非常老实，百分之百的出勤；爱打闹的王宗顺和过去讽刺打击孙太宽的人，也检讨了自己的错误。过去孙太宽讲政治，他们都讨厌，现在他们
    一致选举孙太宽当政治教员，每星期上两次政治课。第九小组增产节约的成绩，直线上升着。他们八月份的增产节约计划比七月份提高了百分之十八多。由于劳动效率提高，工资收入也增加了。七月份，第九小组的第三第四等技工，月入达到了七百到八百分，普通工一个月也能得到二、三百分。孙太宽说：
    “我们小组的增产节约计划，今后还要一个月比一个月高，每个工人都有这样的信心。”是的，他们一定可以继续提高生产的，因为他们有着先进思想的坚强保证，全组又能团结互助、大胆创造。
