As Chairman of the China Democratic League, Zhang Lan reports:

    The Peace Conference of the Asian and Pacific Regions will soon be held in Beijing. Representatives from more than thirty countries will gather to discuss the urgent issues of sixteen hundred million people seeking freedom, happiness, and enhanced friendly relations, and avoiding the scourge of war. This is a major event in the movement to defend peace in the Asian and Pacific regions, and also a major event in the movement to defend world peace.

    The people of all countries in the Asian and Pacific regions desire peace and oppose war, demand independence and autonomy, and oppose enslavement and aggression. They also demand economic and cultural exchanges with each other, and oppose discrimination and interference. This is the common aspiration of sixteen hundred million people. However, for a long time, the various actions taken by the US imperialists, who represent the interests of American monopoly capitalists, in this region have been direct attacks on the vital interests of the people of various countries. It even openly launched a war of aggression against Korea, used bacteriological weapons, and openly violated the constraints of the Potsdam Proclamation and other international agreements, reviving Japanese militarism. As a result, the peace and security of the Asian and Pacific regions have been increasingly seriously threatened.

    It is precisely for this reason that the people's representatives from twenty countries in this region came to Beijing in June this year to participate in the preparatory meeting for the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference and issued a declaration of great significance. After returning to their countries, they launched large-scale publicity and organizational work regarding participation in this conference. The broad masses of peace-loving people in various countries have expressed their enthusiastic support and elected their representatives to attend the conference. The call of the preparatory meeting has received a widespread response, forming a broad mass movement. This shows how deeply the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions are concerned about the peace and security of this region and the friendly relations between each other.

    We advocate that all international disputes must be resolved through peaceful consultation and great power agreements, that armed aggression and the use of weapons of mass destruction must be stopped immediately, that the principles of national independence and equality must not be violated, and that the people of all countries have the right to manage their own affairs without foreign interference. We believe that countries with different political and economic systems can coexist peacefully, and that international economic and cultural relations can continue to develop on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Therefore, we sincerely welcome the official opening of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Conference in our capital and fully agree with the following issues as the central topics of this conference:

    (1) Guaranteeing the independence, freedom, and peace of the people of the Asian and Pacific regions, and opposing arms expansion and war preparations. Prohibiting war-mongering and the propagation of racial hatred; abolishing all suppression of peace propaganda, and demanding freedom for the peace movement. Prohibiting the use of atomic, bacteriological, and chemical weapons; opposing the bombing and killing of non-combatants and peaceful residents—strengthening compliance with international law.

    (2) Developing fair and mutually beneficial international economic relations and cultural exchanges, opposing blockades and embargoes, improving people's lives, and enhancing the welfare of women and children.

    (3) Opposing the resurgence of Japanese militarism, and opposing the use of Japan as a base for aggression, in order to eliminate the serious threat to the peace of the Asian and Pacific regions.

    (4) Peacefully resolving the Korean issue on a fair and reasonable basis and reasonably resolving all issues related to peace in the Asian and Pacific regions (including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaya, etc.).

    We believe that as long as the sixteen hundred million people of the Asian and Pacific regions, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, ethnic differences, and occupational categories, can unite more broadly and take concerted action to oppose the war policies and aggression policies of US imperialism, they can form a huge force for defending peace, repelling the threat of war, guaranteeing the independence of all nations, and ending the disasters caused by arms expansion and war preparations. That is to say, although peace is under serious threat, peace can be completely saved. Here, we want to tell the American people: the aggressive war policy currently pursued by the American government cannot represent your interests and will. This aggressive war policy only brings you increasingly heavy taxes, rising prices, declining living standards, family separations, and the death of your loved ones in the crossfire. Therefore, like us, your greatest interest is to maintain lasting international peace. In your country, only a small group of monopoly capitalists and war-mongers are carrying out aggression, creating wars, undermining world peace, and threatening human civilization in order to make huge profits from aggressive wars. Therefore, the enemies of peace are not only our enemies but also your enemies. I sincerely hope that you—the peace-loving American people—will launch a broader peace movement in your country and elect your representatives to participate in this important conference, and work with us to jointly strive for the noble cause of maintaining peace.

    Peace cannot wait, it requires peace-loving people to unite and strive for it. This conference is an important meeting for the people of various countries in the Asian and Pacific regions to strive for peace in Asia, the Pacific, and even the whole world. The Chinese people will support this conference with positive actions and practical work, and strive to achieve the noble goals of sixteen hundred million people and all mankind.

### 更广泛地把和平的力量团结起来

    更广泛地把和平的力量团结起来
    中国民主同盟主席　张澜
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议，不久就要在北京召开了。三十多个国家的代表们将聚首一堂，讨论关于十六亿人民寻求自由幸福，增进友好关系，避免战争灾难的各项迫切问题。这是保卫亚洲及太平洋区域和平运动中的一件大事，也是保卫世界和平运动中的一件大事。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民，都要求和平，反对战争，都要求独立自主，反对奴役和侵略，都要求在经济上、文化上互相交流，反对歧视和干涉。这是十六亿人民的共同愿望。但是，很久以来，代表美国独占资本家利益的美帝国主义者在这个区域里面所采取的各种行动，却是直接地向各国人民的生存利益进攻。它甚至公开发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，使用细菌武器，公开违背了波茨坦公告和其它国际协议的约束，复活日本的军国主义。这样，就使亚洲及太平洋区域的和平安全受到了日益严重的威胁。
    正是因为这个缘故，这个区域里面的二十个国家的人民代表，在今年六月间先后到北京参加了亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的筹备会议，发表了具有重要意义的宣言。他们回国以后，在国内大规模地展开了关于参加这个会议的宣传工作和组织工作。各国爱好和平的广大人民都热烈地表示拥护，并选出了他们的出席会议的代表。筹备会议的号召已获得了普遍的响应，形成广泛的群众性运动。这表明亚洲及太平洋区域的各国人民是如何深切地关心这个区域的和平安全和相互之间的友好关系。
    我们主张一切国际纠纷必须用和平协商和大国协议的办法来解决，武装侵略和使用大规模杀人武器的行为必须立刻制止，民族独立和平等的原则绝对不容侵犯，各国人民有权管理自己的事务而不受外来的干涉。我们认为不同政治经济制度的国家可以和平共存，国际经济和文化关系，可以在平等互利的基础上继续发展。因此，我们竭诚欢迎亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议在我国首都正式召开，并完全赞同这次大会以下列几项问题作为中心议题：
    （一）保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立、自由与和平，反对扩军备战。禁止关于战争的叫嚣及种族仇恨的宣传；取消一切对和平宣传的压制，要求和平运动的自由。禁止使用原子的、细菌的及化学的武器；反对对于非战斗人员及和平居民的轰炸与屠杀——加强对于国际法的遵守。
    （二）发展平等互利的正当国际经济关系与文化交流，反对封锁和禁运，改善人民生活，增进妇女儿童的福利。
    （三）反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为侵略基地，以消除对于亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁。
    （四）在公平合理的基础上和平解决朝鲜问题并合理地解决亚洲及太平洋区域（包括越南、寮国、高棉、马来亚等地在内）一切有关和平的问题。
    我们相信，只要亚洲及太平洋区域的十六亿人民，不分政治见解、宗教信仰、民族差别和职业种类，能够更广泛地团结起来，采取一致的行动，反对美帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策，那就能够形成保卫和平的巨大力量，可以打退战争的威胁，保证各民族的独立，终止扩军备战所招致的灾难。这就是说，和平虽然受着严重的威胁，但是，和平是完全可以拯救的。这里我们要告诉美国人民：美国政府目前所执行的侵略战争政策决不能代表你们的利益和意志，这种侵略战争政策只是给你们带来了日益加重的税收，日益高涨的物价，日益下降的生活水平，家庭离散，和你们的亲人在炮火下的死亡。因此，和我们一样，你们的最大利益就是维护国际间的持久和平。在你们国度内，只有一小撮垄断资本家和战争贩子在施行侵略，制造战争，破坏世界和平，威胁人类文明，以便利用侵略战争来大发其财。所以，和平的敌人不仅是我们的敌人，也是你们的敌人。我热诚地希望你们——爱好和平的美国人民在你们国内展开更广泛的和平运动，并选出你们的代表来参加这次重要的会议，来和我们一起为维护和平这一崇高事业而共同奋斗。
    和平不能等待，需要爱好和平的人民团结起来争取。这次会议就是亚洲及太平洋区域各国人民为争取亚洲、太平洋以至全世界和平的重要会议。中国人民将以积极的行动和实际的工作来支持这次会议，为实现十六亿人民和全人类的崇高目标而努力。　（新华社）
