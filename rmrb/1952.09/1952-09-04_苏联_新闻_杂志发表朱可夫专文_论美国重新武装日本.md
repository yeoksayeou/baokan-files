Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 2nd: The latest issue of "News" magazine published an important paper by Zhukov, corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, entitled "The Pacific Alliance and the Rearmament of Japan."

Zhukov wrote: Every day, new evidence emerges of Japan's intensified rearmament. Formal military appropriations in the 1952-1953 budget reached 220 billion yen. Heavy industry, especially the machine-building and chemical industries—both of which are producing for military orders—has reached the production level of 1937, on the eve of Japan's full-scale invasion of China. The so-called National Police Reserve of 75,000 men will be reorganized into an army of more than 100,000 men by the end of this year, and will be expanded to fifteen divisions, totaling 300,000 men, by 1955. In addition, Japan plans to build an air force of 1,500 aircraft and a navy of 300,000 tons of ships within five years.

Zhukov pointed out: These developments are praised by U.S. officials, who consider a rearmed Japan as the "vanguard against communism." This is how U.S. official spokesmen view the political and strategic situation in the Pacific.

But they do not say how much of reality and how much of subjective fantasy there is in their view that a revived Japan with a strong military force will obediently follow the leadership of the State Department and the Pentagon.

Australia and New Zealand, both of which have treaty ties with the United States, will seek U.S. aid in the event of a renewed aggression by Japanese warlords. Australian and New Zealand public opinion expresses a somewhat different view of the situation in the Pacific.

Zhukov further quoted the views of several Australian politicians, who pointed out that there is no guarantee that a rearmed Japan will not one day turn against Australia. Zhukov pointed out that Australia and New Zealand are members of the Pacific Alliance, which is supposed to guarantee them against possible renewed Japanese aggression. However, both countries face the prospect of becoming partners of a rearmed Japan through the U.S.-Japan military agreement. It is noteworthy that the reactionary newspapers of the United States and Japan constantly insist that Japan be allowed to join the alliance.

The author continued: Japanese militarism is once again becoming an independent factor in world affairs. Due to the intensified expansion of armaments based on strong industrial potential, it is difficult to limit Japan's rearmament. Even if the United States wants to "prohibit" the Japanese ruling class from preparing to invade the most vulnerable South, it will find it very difficult to do so. The more militarily powerful Japan becomes, the more difficult it will be for Western countries to control this Far Eastern "ally" of theirs. Japan's economic expansion in South and Southeast Asia has caused serious anxiety among Australian and New Zealand business people.

While pursuing a policy of encouraging the militarization of Japan, the United States is also pursuing a policy of encouraging Japanese exports. It must be pointed out that the U.S. attempt to obstruct normal trade between Japan and China has only resulted in the Japanese ruling clique expanding southward again.

The Japanese government has long ceased to recognize the regulations of the Far Eastern Commission. The purpose of this committee is to prevent Japan from carrying out aggression again in the Far East.

News from Japan indicates that the Japanese machine-building industry is prepared to shift from repairing American aircraft to manufacturing Japanese aircraft, including jet aircraft. The pre-war physics and chemistry research institute, which was considered Tojo's main war machine, has been re-established. Therefore, it is no wonder that Japanese militarists believe that they can now declare that the United States' control over the Police Reserve is superfluous and harmful, and Japanese generals declare that their own training methods are much more "economical" and "effective."

Zhukov concluded: In the future, Washington's considerations of "economy" and "effectiveness" may develop to such an extent that it deems it necessary to further encourage its dangerous "ally" to harm other countries.

If that day finally comes—which is possible—then many Australians will probably regret not having handed over the military base on Manus Island, Australia's northern outer defense outpost, to the United States.

    苏联“新闻”杂志发表朱可夫专文
    论美国重新武装日本
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二日讯：最近一期“新闻”杂志刊载了苏联科学院通讯院士朱可夫的一篇重要论文，题为“太平洋联盟与日本重新武装”。
    朱可夫写道：每一天都出现有日本加紧重新武装的新证据。一九五二年到一九五三年预算中的正式军事拨款达二千二百亿日元。重工业，特别是机器制造工业和化学工业——这两种工业都在为军事定货进行生产——已达到一九三七年日本全面进攻中国前夕的生产水平。现有七万五千人的所谓国家警察后备队，将在今年年底以前改编为一支十多万人的陆军，并且在一九五五年以前，扩充到十五个师，共三十万人。此外，日本还计划在五年内建立一支有一千五百架飞机的空军和有三十万吨舰只的海军。
    朱可夫指出：这些发展为美国官方人士所赞许，他们认为重新武装的日本是“反共的先锋”。这就是美国官方发言人对太平洋的政治和战略情况的看法。
    但是他们没有说出，在他们的认为复活了的、有强大军事力量的日本将卑顺地听从国务院和五角大楼领导的这种见解当中，有多少是现实的成分，有多少是主观幻想的成分。
    澳大利亚和新西兰这两个国家都与美国有条约的联系，将在一旦日本军阀重新侵略时寻求美国的援助。澳大利亚和新西兰的舆论，对太平洋的情况表示了多少不同的看法。
    朱可夫进一步引述了若干澳大利亚政治家的见解，他们指出：并不能保证重新武装了的日本不会有一天掉过头来对付澳大利亚。朱可夫指出：澳大利亚和新西兰是太平洋联盟的成员国，这个联盟据说是要保证它们免受可能重新发生的日本侵略的。然而，这两个国家却都面临着这样的前途：通过美日军事协定而成为重新武装了的日本的伙伴。值得注意的是，美国和日本的反动报纸都不断坚持要让日本加入这个联盟。
    作者继续写道：日本军国主义正在再度成为世界事务中的一个独立因素。由于以强大的工业潜力为基础的加紧扩张军备，要限制日本的重新武装是很困难的。即使美国要想“禁止”日本统治阶级准备向最易被攻破的南方侵略，它将发现这是很不容易办到的。日本在军事上愈强大，则西方国家要想控制它们的这个远东“盟国”就愈困难。日本在南亚和东南亚的经济扩展，已引起了澳大利亚和新西兰商界人士的严重焦虑。
    美国在推行鼓励日本军国主义化的政策的同时，也在推行鼓励日本出口的政策。必须指出，美国企图阻碍日本与中国之间的正常贸易，结果只不过使日本统治集团再度向南扩展。
    日本政府早已不承认远东委员会的规定了。这个委员会的目的是防止日本的再度在远东进行侵略。
    从日本来的消息表明，日本机器制造工业已准备从修理美国飞机转变到制造日本飞机，包括喷气飞机。被认为是东条的主要战争机构的战前的物理和化学研究机构，已重新成立了。因此，难怪日本军国主义分子认为现在可以声明美国对警察后备队的控制是多余的和有害的，日本将领们宣称他们自己的训练方法要“节省”和“有效”得多。
    朱可夫在结论中写道：将来可能有一天，华盛顿关于“节省”和“有效”的考虑会发展到这种程度，以至于认为需要进一步鼓励它的危险的“盟国”危害其他国家。
    如果这一天终于来到——这是可能的——，那么，到那时候，许多澳大利亚人大概要后悔，不该把澳大利亚在北方的外围防御据点马纳斯岛的军事基地交给美国。
