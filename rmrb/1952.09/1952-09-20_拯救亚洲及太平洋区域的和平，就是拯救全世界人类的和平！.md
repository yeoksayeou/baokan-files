Saving Peace in the Asian and Pacific Region Is Saving World Peace!
By Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

The Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is about to open in Beijing, the capital of China. This is a conference longed for by the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region, and indeed by the people of the world. It will be a new and broad unity of peace forces, and it will also prove the determination of peace-loving people to defend peace.

This conference will discuss how to safeguard the independence, freedom, and peace of the people in the Asian and Pacific region; discuss how to develop equal and mutually beneficial international economic and cultural exchanges, and oppose blockade and embargo; discuss how to eliminate the serious threats to peace in the Asian and Pacific region, oppose the resurgence of Japanese militarism, and oppose the use of Japan as a military base; and discuss how to end the Korean War on a fair and reasonable basis, and oppose attempts to solve the Korean issue through military oppression. All other peace-related issues in the Asian and Pacific region will also be given importance and consideration at this conference. All of this represents the common aspirations and demands of more than 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region.

The peace work in the Asian and Pacific region is part of the entire world peace cause. People all over the world yearn for a peaceful and happy life, are willing to be friendly with each other, and oppose aggression. As Rewi Alley of New Zealand said: "Today, people all over the world demand peace and a good life. However, wars are still going on, civilians are being massacred, and people are paying unprecedented heavy taxes to expand the military, and science is being used to invent new weapons of mass destruction." We, the vast people of the Asian and Pacific region, have personally experienced the disasters of World War II, and therefore we understand even more the harm that war brings to mankind. We firmly believe that countries with different political and economic systems can coexist peacefully. The peace movement is nothing more than mutual respect for each other's independence and freedom. We oppose aggression and will never invade others; we oppose interference in the internal affairs of others and will never allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. This is the guarantee for the peaceful and happy life of the people of the world.

At present, a small handful of warmongers in the world, in order to consolidate their position of continuing to enslave mankind, are actively engaged in arms expansion and war preparations, and undermining the cause of peace, but they are also stealing the slogans of "peace, democracy, and humanitarianism." What is their "peace, democracy, and humanitarianism"? Just look at all the evil deeds of the United States in Japan and the Far East and you will understand. In the San Francisco conference on September 8 last year, the United States forced Japan to sign the illegal separate peace treaty with Japan, and then signed a series of "US-Japan Security Treaty," "Administrative Agreement," "Base Agreement," etc., which completely turned Japan into a colony and military base. They used these treaties and agreements to fully help the revival of Japanese militarism. On the other hand, Japan has to provide US$155 million in occupation fees every year. At the same time, the United States has controlled the economic lifeline of Japan through so-called "relief" "aid" and even direct investment. Eighty-five percent of Japan's economy is completely controlled by American monopoly capitalists. Due to the intensified enslavement in the seven years since the occupation, more than 12.5 million industrial workers in Japan are forced to sell their labor in a state of semi-starvation, and more than 16 million landless or land-poor farmers are forced to supply food while they themselves are starving. A large number of Japanese national capitalists have been subjected to the double oppression of American monopoly capitalists and the re-emerging old Japanese financial groups. The United States is also continuing to delay negotiations and carry out a war of aggression in Korea, inhumanely using bacteriological weapons and chemical weapons, indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities, and massacring prisoners of war. This is the "peace, democracy, and humanitarianism" of the warmongers. From August 4th to 7th this year, the United States held the so-called Council of the ANZUS Treaty in Honolulu, the purpose of which is still to form an aggressive military alliance similar to the North Atlantic aggressive group in the Pacific. However, peace-loving people from all countries in the Asian and Pacific region have long seen through these aggressive conspiracies. For example, Dr. Anand, Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, once pointed out: "The purpose of the Pacific Pact is to tighten the shackles of slavery on the heads of Asians." In fact, warmongers are expanding their armies and preparing for war in both Europe and Asia, in the North Atlantic and South Pacific, which not only tightens the chains on the heads of the Asian people, but also puts heavy chains on the heads of the American people.

In the United States itself, military spending accounts for 85 percent of the fiscal budget for 1952-53, with a deficit as high as 14.4 billion US dollars, and it is still increasing. The price index continues to rise, inflation is rampant, the burden on the American people is increasing day by day, and the living standard is declining day by day. There are more than 13 million unemployed people, which is nearly one-tenth of the American population. This is the disaster that a small handful of warmongers in the United States have forced the American people to suffer. The US government recently passed a law stipulating that youths aged 18 to 25 residing abroad should register so that they can be called up for service at any time, otherwise they will lose their citizenship. However, many youths residing abroad, such as in Canada, have announced that they will renounce their citizenship and refuse to register. This is enough to prove that the American people, like the peace-loving people of the world, hate war and demand peace.

Peace cannot be waited for; peace needs peace-loving people to unite and save it. The purpose of the Asian and Pacific Regional Peace Conference is to unite the vast peace-loving people in this region, including the people of the United States, to jointly stop war and save peace. But what the warmongers fear most is peace, so they try to use the power of their countries to undermine this conference. The United States and a few countries that accept the orders of the US masters have tried every means to prevent the peace representatives elected by the vast people in their countries from attending this conference. They do not know that doing so will only stir up the anger of the people, and the peace movement will surely become more extensive and stronger. Our conference will surely be able to unite the 1.6 billion people in the Asian and Pacific region to take concerted action to undertake the lofty cause of saving peace. I believe that the infinite power of people's unity will surely enable peace to defeat war! (Xinhua News Agency)

    拯救亚洲及太平洋区域的和平，就是拯救全世界人类的和平！
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席  陈叔通
    亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议即将在中国首都北京开幕。这是全亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿广大的人民所渴望着的，亦即是全世界人民所渴望着的一个会议。它将是一个新的广大的和平力量的大团结，同时也就证明了爱好和平的人民保卫和平的决心。
    这次会议将要讨论怎样保障亚洲及太平洋区域人民的独立自由与和平；讨论怎样发展平等互利的正当国际经济与文化交流，反对封锁和禁运；讨论怎样消除亚洲及太平洋区域和平的严重威胁，反对日本重新军国主义化，反对将日本作为军事基地；并且讨论怎样在公平合理的基础上结束朝鲜战争，反对企图用军事压迫来解决朝鲜问题。亚洲及太平洋区域其他一切有关和平的问题亦必将受到这次会议的重视和考虑。所有这一切，都代表了亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿以上人民共同的愿望和要求。
    亚洲及太平洋区域的和平工作是整个世界和平事业的一部分。全世界人民都渴望着过和平幸福的生活，愿意互相友好，反对侵略，正如新西兰路易·艾黎说：“今天，全世界人民都要求和平和美好的生活。可是，战争却正在进行，平民被屠杀，为了扩军，人民交纳了空前未有的重税，科学被人用来发明大规模毁灭人类的新武器。”我们亚洲及太平洋区域广大的人民曾亲身经历到第二次世界大战的灾难，因此也就更懂得战争给人类的危害性。我们坚信不同的政治经济制度的国家可以和平共处。和平运动不是别的，就是相互尊重彼此的独立与自由。我们反对侵略，也决不侵略别人；我们反对干涉别人的内政，也决不容许别人干涉自己的内政。这也就是世界人民和平幸福生活的保障。
    目前世界上一小撮战争贩子为了妄图巩固他们继续奴役人类的地位，正积极地进行着扩军备战，破坏和平事业，但他们却也盗窃了“和平、民主、人道”的口号。他们的“和平、民主、人道”是什么呢？只要看看美国在日本、在远东那一切罪恶行为就明白了。去年九月八日在旧金山会议中美国强制日本签订了非法的单独对日和约，接着又签订了一连串的“美日安全条约”、“行政协定”、“基地协定”等，这就把日本完全变成了殖民地和军事基地。他们利用这些条约和协定全力地帮助日本军国主义复活。另一方面，日本每年还要提供一亿五千五百万美元占领费。同时美国通过所谓“救济”“援助”甚至直接投资，已控制了日本的经济命脉。日本百分之八十五的经济，已完全掌握在美国的垄断资本家的手里。由于占领七年以来变本加厉的奴役，使日本现有一千二百五十余万产业工人被迫在半饥饿的状态下出卖劳力，一千六百余万无地或少地的农民被迫供应粮食而自己饿着肚子。大批的日本民族资本家，受到了美国垄断资本家与日本重新抬头的旧财阀的双重压迫。美国更在朝鲜继续拖延谈判和进行侵略战争，灭绝人性地使用细菌武器和化学武器，滥炸和平城市，屠杀战俘。这就是战争贩子所谓的“和平、民主、人道”。今年八月四日至七日美国在檀香山召开所谓的美、澳、新三国公约理事会，其目的仍是要在太平洋上形成一个类似北大西洋侵略集团的侵略军事联盟。但是亚洲及太平洋区域各国爱好和平的人们早就看透了这些侵略阴谋，如全印度和平理事会副主席安纳德博士即曾指出：“太平洋公约的目的，是要把亚洲人头上的奴役锁链缠得更紧。”其实，战争贩子在欧亚两洲，在北大西洋南太平洋同时扩军备战，不但是加紧了亚洲人民头上的锁链，而且也在美国人民头上加上了重重的锁链。
    美国本身一九五二—五三年度财政预算中军费竟占百分之八十五，赤字高达一百四十四亿美元，并且还在不断地增加。物价指数不断上涨，通货恶性膨胀，美国人民的负担日见加重，而生活水准日见降低。失业人民达一千三百余万人，这是将近美国人口十分之一的数目。这是美国一小撮战争贩子迫使美国人民遭受的灾难。美国政府最近又通过了一项法律，规定凡侨居国外的十八岁到二十五岁的青年，应举行登记，以便随时应召服役，否则就丧失公民权，但是侨居外国的例如在加拿大等地的青年，很多却宣布放弃公民权而拒绝了登记，这就足以证明美国人民正和世界爱好和平人民一样，憎恶战争，要求和平。
    和平不能坐待，和平需要爱好和平的人民团结起来拯救。亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议的目的正是把这个区域广大的爱好和平的人民，包括美国的人民在内，团结起来，共同来制止战争，拯救和平。但战争贩子怕的就是和平，因而他们就妄图利用他们国家的权力来破坏这个会议。美国和少数接受美国主子命令的国家，竟千方百计地阻挠他们国内广大人民所推选出来的和平代表前来出席这次会议。他们不晓得这样做，只有掀起人民的怒潮，和平运动必定更加广泛，更加坚强。我们这次会议亦必更能团结亚洲及太平洋区域十六亿人民大家采取一致行动来担负拯救和平的崇高事业。我相信人民团结的无穷无尽的力量必然会使和平战胜战争！（新华社）
